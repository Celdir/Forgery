7   INT. DR. WOODRUFF'S OFFICE - NYU MEDICAL SCHOOL                  7

Kumar stands up and answers his cell phone.

Dr. Woodruff is offended. He takes a sip of from a mug of

coffee and watches as Kumar begins pacing around the office.

Intercut:

INT. HAROLD'S CUBICLE - SIMULTANEOUS

Harold is talking on his office phone...

Dr. Woodruff can't believe Kumar's choice of words.

Dr. Woodruff is so shocked that the mug of coffee simply

slips out of his hands. Hot coffee goes all over his shirt.

Woodruff yells and starts wiping his shirt with a napkin.

Kumar hangs up the phone and sits back down.      Dr. Woodruff is

stunned.

Dr. Woodruff is flustered.   He doesn't know how to react.

Dr. Woodruff is at a loss for words.

Kumar notices a framed picture of a HOT TEENAGE GIRL on Dr.

Woodruff's desk. He picks it up.

A disturbed Dr. Woodruff grabs the portrait out of Kumar's

hands.

ANGLE - TELEVISION

It's an anti-marijuana commercial. Two teenagers are

listening to rock music in a house without parents. One

teenager (blonde) passes a joint to the other (brown haired).

Nervously, Brown Haired Kid takes a hit of the joint. Right

after he exhales, he walks over to his DAD'S GUN RACK and

takes out a LONG RIFLE...

The Brown Haired Kid puts the end of the rifle in his mouth.

We see Blonde Haired kid in slow motion go "Nooooo!" BANG!

WE HEAR A GUNSHOT AS THE SCREEN TURNS BLACK...

ANGLE -    HAROLD AND KUMAR

They're laughing their asses off at the commercial.

Harold continues flipping channels...

ANGLE- TV

We see a News report

ANGLE - Harold and Kumar

Harold's not interested.       He continues flipping...

Kumar points to the TV where we see a CLIP FROM SIXTEEN

CANDLES--[Long Duk Dong talking about quiche/round pie]

Kumar laughs.   Harold isn't amused.

We see another CLIP [Long Duk talking about the chores he

does for the grandparents].

Harold gives Kumar a "don't even joke" look. He then

violently grabs the bong from Kumar and lights it. Kumar

laughs as Harold exhales a lot of smoke...

HAROLD bends down and picks up A BUNCH OF DELIVERY MENUS that

have been left on the floor...

23   INT. ROSENBERG AND GOLDSTEIN'S APARTMENT                     23

Sitting on the couch is ROSENBERG (a seemingly "nice Jewish

boy," wearing khakis and a sweater) and GOLDSTEIN (a more

depraved Jewish boy, wearing a t-shirt with a picture of the

OLSEN TWINS-- underneath the picture we see the words,

"FINALLY LEGAL ON JUNE 13, 2004"). Both of them are taking

bong hits (out of a shofar bong) while watching TV as Harold

and Kumar enter...

Rosenberg and Goldstein continue staring at the TV...

Out of the corner of Kumar's eye, he notices Harold grabbing

a piece of beef jerky from Rosenberg & Goldstein's coffee

table.

Harold acts like he's going to put the jerky back, but as

soon, as Kumar turns his attention back to Rosenberg and

Goldstein, he slips it his pocket.

Dude, the things I'd eat out of her ass,

you have no idea.

Bacon, shellfish, milk with meat, you

name it...

A CAR HONKS BEHIND THEM. Kumar turns around and sees a

number of cars lining up behind them. Right behind them, A

BIG BURLY GUY leans his head out of a car...

The honking continues as HAROLD starts to open the door...

Kumar can't take it anymore. Just as Harold is about to get

out of the car, Kumar hits the gas and screeches away.

A LOUD ALARM GOES OFF BEHIND THEM...

Harold throws the joint out the window.

HAROLD GRABS THE WHEEL AND TURNS IT!

Kumar points to a sign indicating that the HIGHWAY is ahead.

With that, the HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN OF ALL TIME ROARS AS

HE COMPLETES A MONSTER DUNK. In celebration, he violently

bumps chests with his teammates.

The HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN stares HAROLD and KUMAR down.

KUMAR begins inching forward.

The BASKETBALL PLAYERS slowly begin moving aside.

Even though the Players are making way for Harold and Kumar,

they're still no more than a foot or two from the car at all

times. Harold is scared shitless. He then notices the

HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN holding the basketball.

HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other, devastated.

HAROLD and KUMAR are freaking out.

The BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE senses their desperation.

KUMAR looks at HAROLD. The guy makes a convincing case.

HAROLD is clearly torn. We sense that this is an important

moment for the guys...

HAROLD thinks for a moment, then licks his lips.

KUMAR puts his hand out.   HAROLD shakes it.

He then raises his hand again. HAROLD rolls his eyes...

HAROLD looks into the eyes of the young, eager, Asian

students. He can't bear to tell them the truth...

All the Asian students start high-fiving with each other.

CINDY looks at her watch...

All the Asian students get up...

Hippie Asshole sizes Kumar up and then gives Kumar him a

measly dime bag...

The Hippie Asshole grabs the baggy back from Kumar.

Kumar and the Hippie Asshole stare each other down. After a

couple seconds, Kumar shakes his head, pissed off. He takes

out his wallet and hands all his cash to the Hippie Asshole.

Suddenly, CHRISTY and CLARISSA (TWO GORGEOUS TWINS, BLONDE,

BLUE EYES, BIG BREASTS, BRITISH ACCENTS) approach carrying

take-out bags. They see KUMAR and the Hippie Asshole making

their deal.

KUMAR and HIPPIE ASSHOLE turn and see THE TWINS.   They're

both floored by their hotness.

CLARISSA runs into STALL NUMBER ONE and shuts the door.

The sound of the door shutting causes HAROLD and KUMAR to

look over at that stall.

CHRISTY enters STALL NUMBER THREE and shuts the door.

The sound of the door shutting causes HAROLD and KUMAR to

turn their attention to the other stall. They then look at

each other grossed out.

From above, we see HAROLD and KUMAR struggling, while the

girls have taken their places in the surrounding stalls.

WE HEAR THE SOUNDS OF DIARRHEA HITTING THE BOWL.

HAROLD and KUMAR look horrified.      There is silence for a few

seconds until....

We see HAROLD quizzically mouth "battle shits?"

HAROLD and KUMAR look confused.

WE HEAR A LOUD FARTING NOISE, THEN THE SOUND OF SHIT HITTING

THE WATER...

HAROLD and Kumar look terrified.

SUDDENLY, THE RACCOON COUGHS UP BLOOD ONTO HAROLD'S SHIRT.

HAROLD TURNS THE RACCOON AWAY FROM HIM.          THE RACCOON COUGHS

UP BLOOD ONTO KUMAR.

KUMAR SWERVES THE CAR IN A PANIC, AS HAROLD OPENS HIS WINDOW.

KUMAR WATCHES AS HAROLD CHUCKS THE RACCOON OUT THE WINDOW.

Kumar looks back onto the road, where HE SEES A PAIR OF

HEADLIGHTS HEADING STRAIGHT FOR HIM!

Shit!!!                                Shit!!!

KUMAR quickly hits the brakes, as does the other car. HAROLD

and KUMAR look at each other, breathing heavily. They watch

nervously as the other DRIVER exits his car and begins

walking over to them.

KUMAR rolls down his window.         The DRIVER peers inside...

GOLDSTEIN sees that it's HAROLD and KUMAR.

HAROLD breathes a sigh of relief.

Harold enters the room with a band-aid on his neck...

Kumar stands up quickly.

Just as Harold and Kumar walk down the hallway to the EXIT...

Kumar know that voice all too well...

KUMAR turns around and sees HIS FATHER standing next to HIS

BROTHER SAIKAT (a nerdy-looking Indian guy with glasses, five

years older than Kumar). Both are in doctor attire.

Kumar gives Harold an annoyed look as his dad approaches.

Kumar doesn't have a response.   Saikat's right.

KUMAR lowers his head.   He's been put in his place.

KUMAR gives HIS FATHER a hug.   He even gives SAIKAT a hug.

KUMAR'S FATHER gives KUMAR a quick kiss on the head, then he

and SAIKAT walk away. HAROLD is stunned...

KUMAR holds up SAIKAT and HIS FATHER'S SCAN CARDS.

HAROLD shakes his head in disgust.

HAROLD sees blood squirt out of the PATIENT'S chest.

THE PATIENT HEARS THIS AND LOOKS NERVOUSLY AT HAROLD.

The NURSE hands HAROLD a surgical instrument.

KUMAR interrupts before HAROLD can tell her the truth.

HAROLD looks at KUMAR confused and nervous.

The NURSE is about to rush away, but Kumar stops him.

KUMAR shows the amount he wants with his hands.

HAROLD gives KUMAR a dirty look.

Suddenly, more blood squirts from the Patient's chest.

Harold shouts in disgust, making the Patient more nervous...

KUMAR puts a nitrous oxide mask over the Patient's face.

Harold gives Kumar a look-- "What the fuck are you doing?"

Using the surgical equipment, Kumar actually begins removing

bullets from the bleeding patient!!! Harold can't believe

what's going on.

Suddenly, the Patient begins having trouble breathing! He's

gasping for air! The BEEPING SOUND monitoring his heart rate

begins speeding up to an insane pace.

Kumar quickly examines the patient's chest...

After a couple seconds go by...

This is perfect! We're back on the road.

We have directions now. The rain let up.

And guess what...

HAROLD clicks on the "SAVE" option on his laptop...

While they're stopped at a red light, Kumar takes in his

surroundings and notices something...

Outside, to Kumar's left, on the marquee of a movie theater

we see: "JOHN HUGHES RETROSPECTIVE. CURLY SUE - 9:00.

SIXTEEN CANDLES - 11:00.

Harold looks at the crowd leaving the theater and sees MARIA

standing outside, all by herself. He can't believe it.

Kumar puts his hands on Harold's shoulders to get his

undivided attention.

KUMAR presses a button CAUSING HAROLD'S WINDOW TO GO DOWN.

MARIA looks up. HAROLD QUICKLY DUCKS IN HIS SEAT. HE THEN

REACHES DOWN WITH HIS HAND TO HIT THE GAS PEDDLE. THE CAR

STARTS PEELING OUT...

Kumar tries kicking Harold's hand off the gas.   Just then,

THE CAR BEGINS SHAKING INTENSELY...

Harold's Infiniti HAS DRIVEN OFF THE ROAD AND IS SPEEDING

DOWN A DIRT AND ROCK COVERED HILL.

KUMAR grabs control of the wheel and tries to steer the car

safely. HAROLD is bumping around on the way down the hill.

Finally, they reach the bottom of the hill, near a DIRT ROAD.

The guys silently continue driving, until KUMAR notices a

RASH OF BOILS ON FREAK SHOW'S NECK.

HAROLD nudges him to be quiet. KUMAR looks back over at

FREAK SHOW and sees that ONE OF THE BOILS IS PULSATING.

KUMAR sees that A WHITE PUSS IS NOW OOZING FROM THE BOIL.

HAROLD gives KUMAR a hard elbow to the stomach. He then

looks nervously at FREAK SHOW, who doesn't seem to have heard

a thing. Harold seems relieved.

FREAK SHOW doesn't say anything else. HAROLD and KUMAR don't

know how to react. They feel really uncomfortable. The fact

that nothing happens makes it all the more awkward for them.

LIANE comes in with the pitcher of lemonade.    She pours them

drinks and hands them the glasses...

KUMAR looks disappointed.    HAROLD, however, is intrigued...

Harold and Kumar look at each other in disbelief -- "are we

talking about the same Freakshow?"

HAROLD ponders this for a moment.    He and KUMAR begin

drinking their lemonade.

HAROLD and KUMAR spit the lemonade out simultaneously. They

look at each other in complete shock. Kumar turns to Harold.

Liane starts playing with the knot in her shirt. Harold and

Kumar stare unabashedly. Harold looks outside the window,

where he sees Freak Show changing the tire, apparently busy.

HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other confused.

HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other again, more confused and

kind of disturbed. Kumar turns to LIANE...

KUMAR turns to LIANE in desperation...

Liane walks over to Harold, seductively. Harold is nervous

and doesn't know what he should do. She takes his hand and

puts it on the knot in her shirt. Harold looks over to Kumar,

who gives him a reassuring nod. Harold then pulls on the

cloth, causing the knot to come loose, thereby releasing her

shirt. The shirt is now hanging and just barely covering her

breasts.

Harold looks over to Kumar, then back at Liane...

Liane takes Harold's hands and places them on her breasts.

Kumar looks on enviously. Liane moans in pleasure as Harold

starts to massage her chest.

AT THAT MOMENT, FREAK SHOW ENTERS THE ROOM, holding a

particularly threatening TIRE-IRON...

FREAK SHOW sees HAROLD with LIANE...

90   INT. CONVENIENCE STORE                                        90

Cole and the Punks ignore him.    Harold and Kumar then

approach the Indian Cashier...

The INDIAN CASHIER shrugs his shoulders.

KUMAR SAYS A FEW WORDS IN HINDI, WHICH LIGHTS UP THE

CASHIER'S EYES. Kumar listens as the Cashier tells him the

directions in Hindi-- it takes the Cashier a long time to

explain it. He mentions numerous streets and routes. It

sounds like it's very complicated.

Meanwhile, while they are talking, HAROLD suddenly sees TWO

MORE EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS enter the store, CARRYING A KAYAK

AND A PADDLE. They carry the kayak to the back of the store.

Harold has no idea what the hell is going on. KUMAR and the

CASHIER are too busy talking to notice. Harold watches

nervously as COLE PUTS ON A HELMET AND GETS INTO THE KAYAK...

HAROLD is still focused on COLE and the EXTREME PUNKS...

HAROLD, KUMAR, and the INDIAN CASHIER immediately turn and

look at COLE, WHO IS IN THE KAYAK-- WHICH IS BEING HELD UP BY

THE EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS. THE PUNKS RUN DOWN THE AISLE WITH

THE KAYAK AND LAUNCH IT INTO THE AIR...

In slow motion, we see COLE swing his paddle around in mid-

air, KNOCKING OVER EVERYTHING ON THE SHELVES-- BAGS OF CHIPS,

GLASS JARS OF JELLY, BOTTLES OF SODA, ETC.

The EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS cheer COLE on, while HAROLD, KUMAR,

and the INDIAN CASHIER watch in disbelief.

The kayak lands on the floor.     COLE gets out and celebrates

with his friends.

Meanwhile, all the Extreme Sports Punks begin going crazy

throughout the store, knocking food off the shelves,

bothering other customers.

The INDIAN CASHIER begins yelling at them in HINDI.

Extreme   Sports Punk #1 casually looks through a shelf of

various   kinds of snack chips, discarding them one after an

other.    Finally, he stumbles upon EXTREME CHEDDAR DORITOS.

He goes   apeshit over his find.

He tears open the bag and starts pouring them into his mouth,

getting the chips all over the place.

The INDIAN CASHIER is still yelling.      Cole picks up the

Cashier...

Harold and Kumar watch on as Cole spins the INDIAN CASHIER

around and around.

Pissed, Cole stops in his tracks and drops the Cashier on the

floor. He's pissed. It's clear to Harold that they may get

their asses kicked.

91   EXT. GAS STATION/CONVENIENCE STORE                           91

THEY SEE NEIL IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT, TURNING THE KEY. THEY

WATCH AS HE PUTS THE CAR INTO DRIVE, HITS THE GAS, AND TAKES

OFF, DRIVING THROUGH A SIGN, AND GETTING ON THE ROAD...

Harold and Kumar stand there for fifteen seconds, without

saying a word, as they watch the car slowly disappear in the

distance. Eventually, Harold breaks the silence...

Harold starts to walk back to the convenience store.

Harold is about to walk in, when he sees Cole wind up and

throw a Hostess-like snowball right in the Cashier's face.

"Extremes" all around!

Harold turns around and walks back towards the street. Kumar

walks with him, keeping his distance. They reach the street.

On the other side, he sees AN ORANGE "DON'T WALK" SIGN LIT

UP. Harold presses the "WALK" BUTTON on the post next to him.

Harold waits for the "DON'T WALK" sign to change. It

doesn't. HE STARTS PRESSING THE "WALK" BUTTON REPEATEDLY.

HAROLD waits for a few seconds, but when the light doesn't

change, he begins pressing the button again.

The "DON'T WALK" sign still won't change. Kumar looks to the

left and then to the right. The street is completely empty

and there is no place for a police car to hide.

They stand there for another ten seconds.   It doesn't change.

Harold starts walking angrily across the street.

Before Kumar has a chance to follow, a POLICE CAR FROM OUT OF

NOWHERE FLASHES ITS LIGHTS AND STOPS HAROLD DEAD IN HIS

TRACKS.

Harold walks back over to Kumar, clearly upset within him, as

OFFICER PALUMBO (30's, good looking, tough) gets out of the

car and walks over to them...

OFFICER PALUMBO begins writing a ticket.    Kumar walks over,

flabbergasted...

Harold motions Kumar to "shut the fuck up!"

Harold points to his ID.

Harold is starting to pacify Palumbo.

OFFICER PALUMBO hands Harold his ticket and begins to walk

away.

Kumar grabs the ticket from Harold and looks at it.

Palumbo quickly turns around and returns to the guys.

92   INT. JAIL CELL - 2:30 AM                                    92

Officer Palumbo gives Hippie Asshole a threatening look.

The Mom leaves, with Hippie Asshole clinging to her like a

frightened child.

Palumbo shakes his head and sits down at his desk, where we

see HIPPIE ASSHOLE'S BIG BAG OF WEED, along with Harold's

WALLET and LAPTOP. He then starts filing a report on

Harold...

Harold looks at Officer Palumbo through the bars...

Ignoring Harold, Palumbo turns up the volume on his radio...

Harold turns around and examines his cell. Inside with him

is a black man (TARIK) sitting down, reading a book. Harold

sits down, across from Tarik.

While Harold isn't looking, we see Officer Palumbo take the

cash out of Harold's wallet and pocket it.

TARIK sits up. He looks at OFFICER PALUMBO who, with his

Walkman on, is oblivious to their conversation.

Harold nods.

Harold shrugs his shoulders.

Tarik nods and continues reading his book.    Harold sees that

Tarik is remarkably relaxed.

93   EXT. POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS                            93

94   INT. JAIL CELL - CONTINUOUS                                 94

Although his voice is muffled, we can hear Kumar's words.

Tarik is very confused.

We hear a couple banging sounds from the ventilation shaft.

Then a couple more. Then a couple more. Pouting, Harold

pretends to ignore it.

Tarik rolls his eyes in disbelief.

We hear the banging noise again. And again. Suddenly, THE

VENTILATION SHAFT BREAKS OFF THE CEILING AND KUMAR FALLS OUT

ONTO THE GROUND...

Tarik shakes his head.

Kumar gets up and walks over to the cell.

Harold points to Palumbo's desk, which has the police report,

Harold's I.D., and his laptop.

Harold thinks about this for a second.

Kumar smiles.   He begins searching for a key.

SUDDENLY, A CHEETAH JUMPS OUT FROM BEHIND A BUSH AND LETS OUT

A MONSTROUS ROAR!

The CHEETAH stares HAROLD and KUMAR down.

WITH THAT, THE CHEETAH WALKS OVER TO A NEARBY BUSH AND DRAGS

OUT A HALF-EATEN HUMAN CORPSE IT'S OBVIOUSLY BEEN DEVOURING.

HAROLD and KUMAR stand silently. SLOWLY, the CHEETAH begins

walking directly over to HAROLD...

Suddenly, the CHEETAH OPENS HIS MOUTH WIDE AND CHOMPS DOWN ON

WHAT APPEARS TO BE HAROLD'S GROIN AREA.

HAROLD continues screaming for the next TEN SECONDS.

Eventually, he calms down and looks at the CHEETAH.

107   OMIT                                                        107

HAROLD wipes his face with his sleeve. He then gets up-- he

sees that they are by a random road, all by themselves.

Kumar points to the laptop, which is outside of it's bag,

broken in pieces.

113    EXT. KRISPEE KREME DONUTS                                    113

KUMAR gives HAROLD a hug.

Suddenly, Kumar notices something else inside. Someone else

is sitting down at Rosenberg & Goldstein's table...

Harold watches as Cindy Kim sits down next to Goldstein.

Goldstein puts his arm around her and feeds her a piece of

donut. It looks like Goldstein and Cindy are "an item."

Before Harold can respond, he's hit in the back of the head

by a hacky sack! Cole and the Punks laugh at Harold.

Cole gets in the CRANE POSITION a la THE KARATE KID...

Harold is quiet for a moment as he looks at Cole's little

racist routine. He then lets out a little laugh...

KUMAR walks over to HAROLD and stares him in the eye...

KUMAR walks over to the edge of the cliff and looks out onto

the EARLY MORNING HORIZON. The sun is still rising. The

scene is very picturesque...

THE POLICE SIREN IS GETTING LOUDER...

KUMAR walks over to HAROLD.

From the sound of the sirens, it seems that the police are

getting closer. Harold turns back, facing Kumar...

KUMAR looks up and sees at least A HUNDRED CROWS FLYING

STRAIGHT TOWARDS THEM.

HAROLD AND KUMAR FLY RIGHT INTO THE CROWS.   Numerous birds

collide with their faces...

THE BIRDS CAUSE THE HANG-GLIDER TO GO AGAINST THE WIND,

SENDING HAROLD AND KUMAR DOWN FAST. THEY ARE SCREAMING AND

YELLING AS THEY PLUMMET...

THE HANG-GLIDER FALLS STRAIGHT INTO A TREE AND GETS CAUGHT IN

THE BRANCHES. THEY APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN SAVED.

SNAP!!! THE BRANCH BREAKS OFF, SENDING HAROLD AND KUMAR

STRAIGHT DOWN. THEY FALL ABOUT THIRTY FEET, THUMPING ON

BRANCHES AS THEY FALL...

SMACK!!! THEY HIT THE GROUND AND IMMEDIATELY START ROLLING

DOWN A HILL. THEY CONTINUE ROLLING...ROLLING...ROLLING...

FINALLY-- THEY STOP ROLLING WHEN THEY HIT HARD PAVEMENT.

HAROLD gets up before he can catch his breath...

HAROLD GRABS KUMAR BY THE NECK AND STARTS CHOKING HIM!

142   INT. WHITE CASTLE - 7:00 AM                                  142

HAROLD and KUMAR turn around and see NEIL PATRICK HARRIS

finishing his coke. He throws it in the trash. HAROLD and

KUMAR are stunned.

NEIL tosses HAROLD the car keys.

Harold and Kumar look at each other, relieved.

NEIL hands them some cash...

With that, NEIL walks out of the restaurant.   HAROLD and

KUMAR look at each other, confused.

HAROLD and KUMAR walk over to a booth and take a seat.

KUMAR points to a TV in the corner of the restaurant.    On the

screen we see A MORNING NEWS SHOW.

ON THE TELEVISION:

A FEMALE ANCHOR IS REPORTING THE NEWS...

Tarik and Nathaniel have a bunch of microphones in front of

them...

We see Tarik joined by his parents (Two Old Gay Black Men--

one is comforting the other). Nathaniel walks in front of

the microphone...

INT. WHITE CASTLE

ON THE TELEVISION:

We see footage of OFFICER PALUMBO and THE OTHER COPS taken

away in handcuffs...

Officer Palumbo gets shoved forcefully into the back of a

police car.

Harold and Kumar enjoy this.

ON THE TELEVISION:

We see a picture of COLE and the EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS in the

corner of the screen.

HAROLD and KUMAR slap five.

ON THE TELEVISION:

151   INT. WHITE CASTLE - MOMENTS LATER                            151

THEY FINISH THE REST OF THEIR FIRST BURGERS IN ONE BITE, AND

THEN QUICKLY EAT TWO MORE...

152   INT. WHITE CASTLE - 7:45 AM                               152

KUMAR sees that HAROLD isn't paying attention...

At that moment, BILLY and J.D. walk in the restaurant with

their women, ZOE and TRACY, respectively. TRACY looks like

some bimbo slut that J.D. picked up at a strip club. ZOE, On

the other hand, has a sweet RENEE ZELLWEGER quality about

her. She and Billy are the perfect Hollywood couple...

J.D. and TRACY check out the menu. BILLY takes ZOE aside--

whatever their story is, it seems to have reached the "you

complete me" moment...

BILLY turns around and sees HAROLD...

J.D. hears the commotion and turns around...

KUMAR sees what's going on-- he can't believe it.

J.D. is embarrassed. BILLY tries to placate the situation.

J.D. is stunned.   Now he's a little nervous.

Harold starts to walk away, almost crying. SAD, DEPRESSING

MUSIC BEGINS TO PLAY. Kumar feels sorry for his friend.

Just then, Luis leans his head out the door...

Harold quickly turns around and runs back over.

Luis shakes Harold's hand.    Harold suddenly feels better.

A HOT BLACK CHICK (AISHA), wearing only a bra and g-string,

walks over to Luis and wraps her arms around him...

Aisha kisses him, and walks away to the kitchen. Luis gives

her a little a slap on the ass. Harold doesn't quite know

how to respond to this.

Luis shuts the door.    Kumar runs over to Harold...

Harold feels a little nervous about what Kumar is saying.

Harold starts to walk away from Kumar...
