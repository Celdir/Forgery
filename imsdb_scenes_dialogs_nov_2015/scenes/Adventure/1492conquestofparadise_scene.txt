FADE IN:

CREDITS AND MUSIC OVER:

INT.  AUDIENCE ROOM - GRANADA - DAY

We start on a man's elegant slipper.  He is seated in a

splendid chair.  Moving up the stocking leg, we pass the

garter of Castile, coming to rest on a pair of delicate

hands.  His fore finger impatiently plays with a large

topaz ring.  Over this, we hear distant footsteps, echoing

on marble floors.

A Castilian face:  aquilaine profile, olive complexion,

dark eyebrows and meticulously sculpted beard.  This is

TREASURER SANCHEZ.

A door slams somewhere, the footsteps getting closer.  We

can now here a subdued conversation.

TREASURER SANCHEZ stands up as:

The door opens at the far end of the large gilded room.

A WOMEN, magnificent in somber taffeta, enters.  QUEEN

ISABEL OF SPAIN moves towards him.

He bows slightly as she sits at the end of the large

table.  She is followed by a PRIEST, BROTHER BUYL, and

three dignitaries of Church and State.

All sit beside her.  TREASURER SANCHEZ takes a document

and starts to read aloud.

On screen the words:  GRANADA - SPAIN - 1500

SANCHEZ punctuates each word carefully.

The PRIEST nods.

ISABEL lowers her eyes.

ISABEL looks over at BROTHER BUYL.

Silence.

INT.  HUT - ISLAND - DAY

CLOSE ON the FACE:  COLUMBUS is stretched on a bed,

sweating heavily in fever, clearly delirious.  Insects

crawl over his face, he makes no effort to swat them away.

There is a dripping sound of water.

Rain is falling into the room over documents spread on a

table.  COLUMBUS stands up and moves to the table.  Some

of the walls have been blackened with smoke and flames.  A

lizard scuttles into the shadows.

COLUMBUS stares down at the documents, moving them away

from the rain drips.  He stares out by the window, and we

see:

A devastated landscape.  Flooded roads, half-destroyed

huts, broken trees... A dog picks its way through the mud.

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

A vast stretch of ocean.  It fills the screen.  Unbroken,

infinite, luminous, mysterious -- it stretches away,

meeting and blending with the sky in pale ribbons of pearl

and misty light.

Pulling back, we discover:

A TEN-YEAR-OLD BOY and a strongly built man in his middle

thirties, are riding a mule.  The MAN'S weather-beaten

face frames unusually bright eyes.

On the screen these words:  ANDALUSIA, 1491

COLUMBUS AND HIS SON are following a windthrashed path at

the top of the hill.  COLUMBUS hums a song, and FERNANDO

looks up at him in adoration.

FERNANDO laughs.  He then starts to hum along with his

FATHER.

EXT.  HILLSIDE APPROACH TO LA RABIDA - DAY

A rugged landscape, remote and steep, with lines of stone

walls and thousands of sheep.

FERNANDO, rushes down a slope, barking like a dog, chasing

the sheep who fan out in droves in front of him.  High-

spirited and wild, FERNANDO laughs and tumbles over.

COLUMBUS rides his mule along the narrow track, watching

his SON'S antics with amusement.  In the distance, the

solitary figure of A MONK SHEPHERD.

COLUMBUS calls out to his son:

FERNANDO runs over.  COLUMBUS lifts him up onto the mule.

As they move along the track we now see, perched on a

distant hill, isolated and austere, the Monastery of La

Rabida, their destination.

EXT.  CLOISTER - LA RABIDA - DAY

As they dismount and walk into the quiet cloisters,

FERNANDO suddenly spots a familiar FIGURE, standing under

the ROMAN arches.

He rushes over, full of joy, to kiss his BROTHER -- an

adolescent dressed in the novice-robe, with a solemn,

delicate face.  DIEGO'S response is constrained.

DIEGO smiles a little, and kisses FERNANDO -- who is

immediately distracted by a procession of hooded MONKS,

hurrying to the refectory, as a bell begins to chime.

The MONKS all turn to greet ANTONIO DE MARCHENA, a white-

haired, elderly man -- and a monk cosmographer.

MARCHENA'S gesture is broad and elegant as he opens his

arms to greet COLUMBUS.  He pats FERNANDO'S head and turns

to DIEGO.

Both CHILDREN leave under the arched roof.  COLUMBUS and

MARCHENA begin to walk across the cloister.

MARCHENA laughs at the compliment.

They have crossed the cloister.  MARCHENA pushes open a

door.

INT.  A HUGE LIBRARY - LA RABIDA - DAY

Hundreds of books lined up on the shelves, displaying the

miracle of printing, a recent German discovery.  Several

MONKS, perched on high stools behind lecterns, are busily

"ILLUMINATING" some of these massive volumes, delicately

painting around the letters in bright colors and gold

leaf.

Rays of light fall diagonally through high openings,

projecting geometric patterns on the tiled floor.  As

MARCHENA and COLUMBUS move forward their conversation is

punctuated by light and shadow.

Almost casually, he hands COLUMBUS a letter.

COLUMBUS stops dead in his tracks.  Almost frantically he

tears open the letter, hardly able to believe his eyes.

MARCHENA pushes open a second door, hidden behind a wooden

panel.

INT.  STUDY - LA RABIDA - DAY

MARCHENA is not a tidy man.  Books are piled up on the

floor, the desk, on every shelf, along with maps,

instruments of astronomy... the visible evidence of an

inquiring mind.

With practiced familiarity, as if they had done this a

hundred times -- which indeed they have -- MARCHENA sits

behind his desk, and COLUMBUS opposite him.  MARCHENA

lights a candle and considers the mess.  Then

methodically, he slowly sweeps it from in front of him

with his sleeve, exposing a large map underneath.

When he looks up again, there is a new severity in his

expression.  He turns over an hourglass.

He leans forward, and points to the map spread out on the

desk.

His finger traces the journey, from west to east.

We are CLOSE now on the map, as we watch his finger

tracing a line between Europe and the Far East.

We notice that the outline of the European continent is

familiar.  But we also notice that, in that great expanse

of ocean, the whole American continent is missing.

CLOSE ON MARCHENA'S FACE, touched by the mystery.

MARCHENA throws his quill in the air in frustration.  He

glances at the hourglass:

EXT.  COURTYARD - LA RABIDA - EVENING

DIEGO and FERNANDO wait in the courtyard.  COLUMBUS

appears and lifts FERNANDO onto the mule.  DIEGO turns to

go.

COLUMBUS walks over to him, squats down so their eyes

meet.  He looks at his SON for a moment.

Uncomfortable with the proposition, DIEGO cannot find an

answer.

COLUMBUS reaches out -- and touches his shoulder.

He climbs up behind FERNANDO, who waves back to his

BROTHER as they ride off.

EXT.  CADIZ - STREETS AND CATHEDRAL SQUARE - NIGHT

COLUMBUS leads the mule, carrying the sleeping FERNANDO,

through narrow streets.  There's a clamorous noise in the

air.  Suddenly a large group of YOUNG MEN, shouting with

excitement, run up the street and brush past them.  Then

more people.  FERNANDO sits up straight.  The noise grows,

rowdy, rumbling, sharp with excitement and violence.

Huge CROWDS have thronged the massive old square outside

the cathedral.  Holding the mule by its reins, COLUMBUS

tries to push his way through... Suddenly, as a gap opens

in the crowd, we see the cause of the excitement:  in the

center of the square stand three pyres, already alit.

HOODED EXECUTIONERS are busy around the fires.

Before COLUMBUS can stop him, FERNANDO has slipped off the

mule and into the crowd.

But the BOY has been swallowed into the mass of people.

COLUMBUS tries to follow him.  Flames leap into the night

sky with a terrible crackling, lighting up the square with

a lurid glow.  Prayers are being chanted somewhere.

FERNANDO has elbowed his way to the front of the crowd.

A PRIEST brandishes a crucifix in front of the face of a

MAN bound to a post.  The heretic wears the "sambenito", a

robe made of coarse fabric on which his sins have been

crudely illustrated -- we see cabalistic signs,

indicating that the man is Jewish.

THE MAN'S eyes are mad with fear.  But he refuses to kiss

the crucifix, as a sign of his repentance.

FERNANDO is transfixed by the scene, but still doesn't

realize what is happening.  He is too close to the

platform to see what is in the flames of the other pyres.

He motions to his son, takes the BOY'S hand, and drags him

away from the scene.  But FERNANDO looks back.  The

distance now allows him to see inside the flames.

A HALF-CHARRED FIGURE -- THE MAN'S face is distorted in a

silent scream... The neck snaps like burning wood, and the

head falls on one shoulder.  Then the whole body collapses

into the fire.

INT.  BEATRIX'S HOUSE - HALLWAY AND STABLE - NIGHT

COLUMBUS and FERNANDO lead the mule into the white-washed,

stone-floored hallway of the modest house.  FERNANDO is

mute, shocked by what he just witnessed.  COLUMBUS takes

the mule into its stall, and as he does so, his mother,

BEATRIX, appears from the kitchen to greet them.  She is a

beautiful woman in her twenties, a calm, strong, domestic

personality.  COLUMBUS tousles the BOY'S hair.  FERNANDO

glances at his MOTHER but looks subdued and doesn't say

anything.

INT.  BEATRIX'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

COLUMBUS joins BEATRIX in the kitchen, where a MAID is

cooking.  He explains Fernando's subdued manner.

BEATRIX nods.  He goes to the stone butt and pours water

on his hands.

BEATRIX puts the candle on the table.  Her face lights up

with a smile.  He walks to her, and kisses her.

They laugh and kiss.

INT.  BEATRIX'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

They are eating around the table, and FERNANDO is

unusually silent and thoughtful.  COLUMBUS pours a little

wine into FERNANDO'S water, to distract him.  FERNANDO

looks up at him, surprised.  COLUMBUS smiles, then looks

over at BEATRIX.

He winks at FERNANDO.  BEATRIX smiles.

INT.  BEATRIX'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

The room is dark.  As COLUMBUS approached the bed with a

candle, it illuminates the naked body of BEATRIX.  BEATRIX

looks up at him intently.  A drop of wax falls on her

skin.  She flinches, murmurs...

They make love.

EXT.  SALAMANCA UNIVERSITY - DAY

A medieval "campus".  Students-novices are playing

"pelote", with basket-gloves and a hard ball.  They run

with their robes tucked around their waist, revealing

white legs.  Others are studying, reading, hurrying to

their class.

We find COLUMBUS watching the game from the steps above

the court.  Others are waiting with him.  A MONK comes

from a door, and looks around the group.

INT.  AUDIENCE ROOM - UNIVERSITY OF SALAMANCA - DAY

An El Greco painting.  A tableau of twenty MEN sitting on

dark, sculpted seats.  Candles throw a gloomy light on

their faces.  Some are Churchmen, others are dressed in

bourgeois outfits.

Only one of them is richly dressed in the grand Spanish

fashion -- he is SANCHEZ, Treasurer of the House of

Aragon.  A MONK (Don AROJAZ) holds a stick with an ivory

claw at the top.  Languidly, he scratches his back -- his

off-hand manner only makes him more impressive than his

peers.

He leans back, satisfied, and pauses for effect.

A ripple of mirthless laughter.

A murmur of protest spreads among the members of the

Commission.  But Columbus is determined to press his

theories.

Indignant and amused murmurs.  DIEGO DE DEZA raises his

voice to quiet the assembly.

Silence.

The murmur increases.

A MAN of simple bearing, that COLUMBUS identifies as

being a seaman, interrupts.

Instantly, the protests stop.

He pauses, and starts walking in front of the experts, as

a lawyer before a grand jury.

The experts listen.  CLOSE ON SANCHEZ'S FACE, impressed by

the boldness.

He walks and stops before TALAVERA, and catches the look

of SANCHEZ, sitting just behind him.

Conscious of a friendlier voice, COLUMBUS sees the

Treasurer SANCHEZ, an imposing man in his fifties.

THE MONK smiles thinly.

Another small rill of laughter.

A hum of interest.  CLOSE ON SANCHEZ -- watching COLUMBUS

intently, a hint of an admiring smile on his lips.

A pause.

The murmur turns to an audible gasp.  AROJAZ gets to his

feet and leans forward, threateningly, the flame of a

candle only inches from his face.

There is absolute silence.  COLUMBUS meets the MONK'S gaze

unflinchingly.

EXT.  TERRACE - UNIVERSITY - DAY

The JURY is alone to deliberate.  Food and wine has been

laid out on tables.  In the distance, students' cries

carry over the conversation.

SANCHEZ approaches.

SANCHEZ bows slightly.

SANCHEZ helps himself to some grapes, looks round at the

other members of the committee, who pretend not to be

listening.

AROJAZ understands the hint, and stops smiling.

SANCHEZ reaches for a decanter of sherry.

He offers the decanter to AROJAZ, who automatically lifts

his glass.  But instead, SANCHEZ pulls back the decanter,

pours himself a drink, and replaces it on the table,

leaving AROJAZ staring at his own empty glass.

And he drinks with a smile.

INT.  LA RABIDA - MARCHENA'S STUDY - EVENING

MARCHENA reads aloud the Commission's letter.

He shakes his head, puts the letter down.  COLUMBUS looks

appalled; devastated.

He paces about the book-lined room.

MARCHENA is shocked.

He seizes a beautiful book from MARCHENA'S desk.

He hurls the book across the room.  MARCHENA is horrified.

COLUMBUS seizes more books from the shelves, just sweeping

them to the floor.

MARCHENA tries to stop him.  In his fury, COLUMBUS

accidentally knocks the poor old MAN to the ground.  His

cries bring three MONKS rushing into the room.

As COLUMBUS continues to rage and scatter books

everywhere, they try to stop him, struggling with this

big, powerful man -- to almost comical effect.  Finally, a

short, muscular MONK delivers a quick punch that sends

COLUMBUS crashing to the floor.

INT.  CHAPEL OF LA RABIDA - EVENING

COLUMBUS lies face down on the stone floor.  He is dressed

in a homespun robe.  His arms are stretched out in

penance.  FERNANDO and DIEGO look down at him.

A pause -- and then FERNANDO lies face down on the floor

beside his FATHER, and stretches out his arms in the same

way.  DIEGO is left looking on, unable to bring himself to

join them.

EXT.  CLOISTER - LA RABIDA - DAY

Along the cloister, maps are drying, hanging like laundry

in the light breeze.  COLUMBUS pins up a new addition.

Another MONK works nearby, in silence.

COLUMBUS turns, to see a small, stocky MAN approaching:  a

middle-class gentleman.  He nods.

He laughs.  COLUMBUS smiles, but doesn't say anything.

PINZON is clearly a little surprised.

COLUMBUS glances around cautiously, and walks a little way

down the cloister, away from the other MONK, gesturing for

PINZON to follow him.  PINZON is yet more surprised by

this strange behavior.

COLUMBUS shakes his head.  PINZON stares at him,

perplexed.

COLUMBUS shakes his head again.

COLUMBUS nods vigorously.

He takes off his hat, wiping his forehead with a silk

cloth.

COLUMBUS nods.

COLUMBUS gives him a glance like one throws a question in

the air.

COLUMBUS looks at him, and bursts out laughing.  The other

MONK looks round severely.  COLUMBUS ducks behind a map,

PINZON following him.  PINZON lowers his voice.

COLUMBUS shakes his head, but looks increasingly

interested by what he's hearing.

COLUMBUS nods.

COLUMBUS looks around, catches the disapproving face of

the MONK, crosses himself, then speaks:

COLUMBUS turns and sees an elegant Lord in his fifties,

examining the maps.

EXT.  STREETS OF GRANADA - DAY

A huge Islamic Crescent being pulled down from the minaret

of a mosque.  SOLDIERS are holding back a crowd at the

foot of the tower.  To the ecstatic cries of the crowd, a

Cross is hoisted up in its place... Astride horses,

COLUMBUS and the Treasurer SANTANGEL are watching the

scene.

They push through an extraordinary scene.  The city of

Granada has just been reclaimed from the moors after

several years of siege.  All around them, SPANISH SOLDIERS

are herding, bedraggled columns of the defeated MOORS,

bearing only a few possessions.  Ragged, half-starved men,

women and children.

The THREE HORSEMEN pass a procession of grateful

PENITENTS, who are crawling on their knees, chanting

psalms and flagellating themselves.  At the head of the

procession, HOODED PRIESTS carry a statue of the Virgin

Mary swathed in silk and lace.

The gates of the Alhambra Palace are in sight.

Bells are pealing triumphantly.  The noise is tumultuous.

They ride towards the magnificent palace.

EXT.  ALHAMBRA PALACE - GARDENS - DAY

Fabulous Moorish gardens:  ponds filled with golden carp;

exotic bird cages hang from lemon trees... The distant

sounds of victory.

SANTANGEL and COLUMBUS walk through the gardens, escorted

by HALBERDIERS.  SOLDIERS pass by, carrying coffers or

piles of documents.

As they approach the inner sanctum, however, there are

fewer people.  They stop by the Lion's Fountain, where

several DIGNITARIES are waiting patiently for an audience.

SANCHEZ appears.  They bow.  SANTANGEL approaches to

murmur a compliment.

SANCHEZ protests softly, and looks over at COLUMBUS, a

half-smile forming on his lips.  Then a DUENA appears, and

motions for COLUMBUS to follow.

INT.  ALHAMBRA PALACE - THRONE ROOM - DAY

An ornate Moorish door is pushed open by the DUENA'S hand.

We enter the Throne Room -- sculptured colonnades,

mosaics... At the far end, windows open onto a view of

Granada's rooftops.

Against this dazzling light, the delicate silhouette of

QUEEN ISABEL OF SPAIN.  The light in her blonde hair

creates a halo around her head as she turns.  COLUMBUS

falls to his knees.

He approaches the window, stopping close to her.  ISABEL

scrutinizes him quickly.

ISABEL smiles, enjoying the lack of obsequiousness.

ISABEL smiles again.

A direct challenge.  She doesn't know what to make of this

man.

This little hint of vulnerability subtly reverses their

positions for a moment.  Now we sense COLUMBUS

scrutinizing her.

A slight pause.

She bursts out laughing.

A beat.

Once again taken off guard, ISABEL flushes, and turns away

slightly to hide it.

A pause.

COLUMBUS bows and goes to leave.  As the DUENA opens the

door for him, he turns back.

And he goes out, leaving her stunned.

EXT.  SANCHEZ'S ESTATE - TREE-LINED ROAD - DAY

A chalk white road, lined with trees.  Two liveried

SERVANTS are walking down the road, one carrying a large

silver tray, the other a smaller tray.

They are overtaken by an ADMINISTRATOR who hurries along

the road, with documents under his arm.

EXT.  SANCHEZ'S ESTATE - STABLE BLOCK AND PADDOCK - DAY

The CLERK enters an imposing stable block.

In the paddock, SANCHEZ is training a magnificent young

horse, making it step sideways, bending it to his will.

The ADMINISTRATOR watches him, unable to interrupt.

Behind him the two SERVANTS can be seen bringing in the

silver trays, with covered dishes of food, a decanter of

wine.  They begin to lay them out on a table.

EXT.  SANCHEZ'S ESTATE - STABLE BLOCK AND PADDOCK - LATER

SANCHEZ pours himself some wine, tucks into his his food,

while the ADMINISTRATOR, clearly working himself up into a

frenzy, reads from a document.

The ADMINISTRATOR looks up.  He is reading the contract

that COLUMBUS has proposed.  SANCHEZ, his mouth full,

gestures for him to continue.

The ADMINISTRATOR looks up again.

SANCHEZ gestures for the document.  Wipes his mouth.

Continues reading, calmly:

He smiles, hands the document back.

And he carries on eating.

INT.  ALHAMBRA PALACE - A RECEPTION ROOM - DAY

Close up on COLUMBUS.

A WOMAN'S HAND quietly, carefully opens a cover of a spy

hole in the wall.  Two beautiful eyes peer through a

grille, into the next room.

What they see:

SANCHEZ and COLUMBUS together.  COLUMBUS is visibly upset.

COLUMBUS tightens his fists, tries to remain calm.

SANCHEZ holds up a document.

He offers the document to COLUMBUS, who takes it, scans it

quickly, shakes his head.

The eyes behind the screen -- the mouth, forming a little

smile.

COLUMBUS leans over the table, faces him.

COLUMBUS smiles.

He turns, strides towards the door.  We hear a WOMAN'S

muffled laughter.

As COLUMBUS goes out, ISABEL appears through a secret

door.  SANCHEZ bows.

ISABEL goes over to the window and looks out.

She turns, questioningly, towards him.

EXT.  ALHAMBRA PALACE GARDENS - POV - DAY

SANCHEZ joins ISABEL at the window.  They see COLUMBUS

striding out and away.

INT.  ALHAMBRA PALACE - A RECEPTION ROOM - DAY

BACK TO SANCHEZ

EXT.  STREET - EVENING

Teeming life.  COLUMBUS pushing his way through crowds.

He is expressionless and distracted.

He looks around him, stops walking.  And then,

unexpectedly, shouts.

All heads turn as if he were totally insane.  He walks on

as if nothing happened.

INT.  BEATRIX'S HOUSE - NIGHT

COLUMBUS is sitting at the kitchen table, by himself, with

a glass of wine.  There is a movement behind him.  BEATRIX

is standing at the foot of the stairs, in a night-shirt.

COLUMBUS turns and looks at her, almost sad.

She smiles.  But he seems to be unable to share her

happiness.

She crosses to him quickly, placing her hand gently on his

mouth.

COLUMBUS kisses her.

INT.  CORRIDOR - BEATRIX'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Strange, unearthly music... A flickering light in a dark

tunnel.  FERNANDO, holding a candle in front of him, walks

slowly down the dark corridor.

Quietly opening a door, he walks into COLUMBUS' study.

INT.  COLUMBUS' STUDY - NIGHT

CLOSE ON:  A huge illustrated map of western Europe and

Asia.  FERNANDO'S candle moves slowly across the Atlantic

Ocean, to the edge of the map.  There, the illustrator's

imagination has created monsters:  terrifying demons;

creatures half-human, half-animal.

Sitting at his desk, COLUMBUS is looking at the map.

Turning, COLUMBUS finds his son beside him.

FERNANDO points at the monsters.  He pulls the boy to him.

He takes a pen, and draws a smile on one of the terrible

monsters, transforming it at once.  FERNANDO laughs

immediately.

FERNANDO pulls the chain with the St. Christopher medal

from under COLUMBUS' shirt.

And he hugs his SON tightly.

EXT.  HILLSIDE AND GATE - PRE-DAWN

A luminous procession passes through a Moorish stone gate,

down to the harbor.  We see the faces of the SAILORS and

their FAMILIES -- COLUMBUS, PINZON AMONGST THEM -- We

sense the fervor and apprehension of the departure.  The

procession is lead by MARCHENA and four young NOVICES

carrying the Madonna.  All hold long, burning tapers,

saying the rosary.  A SAILOR pushes through the crowd, and

kisses the Madonna's feet.

EXT.  PALOS HARBOR - DAWN

Hundreds of candles flicker in the pre-dawn light, held by

the FAMILIES and FRIENDS of the SAILORS.

The SANTA MARIA the PINTA and the NINA nestle against the

quayside.  Dwarfed by the hulls, a flotilla of smaller

fishing craft, returning from night fishing, accidentally

witness this event.

EXT.  MAKESHIFT CONFESSIONAL - DOCKSIDE - DAWN

MARCHENA sits on a barrel and crosses himself.  Behind a

curtain sits COLUMBUS.

MARCHENA recognizes COLUMBUS' voice.

A pause.

A long silence.

No response.

Devastated, MARCHENA reluctantly makes the sign of the

cross.

EXT.  HARBOR AND SHIPS - PALOS - DAWN

COLUMBUS walks over to where BEATRIX and FERNANDO are

waiting.  He kisses and hugs FERNANDO.

EXT.  HARBOR AND SHIPS - DAWN - LATER

The CROWDED QUAYSIDE.  COLUMBUS stands in front of

FERNANDO.

FERNANDO nods, tears in his eyes.  Then COLUMBUS embraces

BEATRIX tightly.  She whispers into his ear.

But COLUMBUS and DIEGO are unable to find words, and

instead they clumsily hug.  Someone taps COLUMBUS'

shoulder.  He turns around to see SANTANGEL.  Wordlessly,

they hug.

Activity on the ships, orders are being shouted, ropes

fore and aft are cast off, splashing into the water... Now

the SHIPS are slowly moving parallel to the quayside.  The

CROWD starts walking abreast to the VESSELS.  WOMEN

holding up babies, blowing kisses, old PARENTS crying...

BEATRIX, HER SONS, AND SANTANGEL are among them.

COLUMBUS suddenly unties the chain around his neck, and

throws it at DIEGO.

DIEGO catches it.  Opening his hand he looks at the

medallion.  Then looks up at his FATHER, elated.

THE SANTA MARIA is now two meters from the QUAY.

SANTANGEL is now opposite COLUMBUS.

They both laugh.

A FISHERMAN, standing in his shrimp-boat lets his hand

slide gently along the gigantic hull.  He stares up at the

SAILORS leaning on the rail.

They wave back.

MARCHENA walking towards the Moorish gate.  He finally

turns, sad and distraught.  He sees:

EXT.  SHIPS AT SEA - WHALES - DAY

THREE SHIPS ON A BOUNDLESS OCEAN.

The sea resembling a DORMANT MONSTER, holding its breath.

A living being, all powerful, capable of unpredictable

metamorphosis.  Music reflects the loneliness, the anxiety

of the crew, the fear of the unknown...

ENORMOUS WHALES moving slowly alongside, surging

majestically through the waves.  Sinking back,

disappearing, their cries taking precedent over the music.

EXT.  DECK - DAY

A SHIP'S BOY is throwing buckets of water on the deck.

A SAILOR is busy clearing the ropes around the mast.

A COOK is blowing life into a brazier, in preparation of

the evening meal.

TEN MEN heaving on a heavy rope, raising the top sail,

punctuating their efforts with a sailor's chant.

EXT.  SANTA MARIA - NIGHT

The crystalline north star -- as if seen through an

instrument.

COLUMBUS' silhouette, by an oil lamp, standing at the

prow.  Holding a quadrant he is aiming at the stars.

SOME SAILORS are watching with curiosity.  One of them is

ALONSO, a rough, stocky Basque.

Near COLUMBUS, on a tressel, various books and charts.  He

makes an entry in the log.  Then goes back to his

quadrant.  He senses MENDEZ standing next to him.

MENDEZ doesn't move, continuing to observe COLUMBUS.

MENDEZ is hesitant.  He nervously clears his throat.

MENDEZ hesitates, then motions to COLUMBUS.  The SAILORS

are watching, and some approach to hear the conversation.

The picture swims across the heavens, until we see the

north star.

The picture steadies.

MENDEZ nods -- and loses equilibrium.  The plumb line

swings.

MENDEZ tries again.

MENDEZ turns to COLUMBUS.

ALONSO does not seem convinced.

EXT.  SANTA MARIA - DECK - DAY

A blazing sun.  The ship is like a furnace, its brass

fittings too hot to touch, the blistering heat making the

air shimmer over the decks.

Desperate for shade, sailors are sheltering under the

sagging prow sail.

The SHIP'S BOY throws an empty bucket attached to a rope

over the side and hauls it back up again, brimming with

water.  As he turns, we see his face, disfigured by a hair

lip.  He drenches himself... From the shade, ALONSO

watches him.

The others laugh.  The BOY, ashamed, tries to ignore them.

ALONSO'S hand accidentally touches a brass fitting; he

reacts like he was burnt.

He sucks his blistered fingers.

The SHIP'S BOY glances round at them.

The BOY turns away, dropping the bucket back into the sea.

The BOY throws more water over the deck.  A SAILOR takes

his guitar, and starts singing an improvised song.

They all laugh.  The BOY, hearing this, climbs to the

crow's-nest like a monkey.

EXT.  SANTA MARIA - RIGGING AND CROW'S-NEST - DAY

We experience a sense of vertigo as we near the top of the

main mast, high above the rolling deck.

The BOY curls like a fetus in the swinging crow's-nest,

exhausted by the heat, and scared.  His eyes are turning

white.  He begins to piss himself...

EXT.  SANTA MARIA - DECK - DAY

Piss is dripping on the deck.  THE SAILORS do not seem to

care.  THE COOK takes a chicken from a cage.  He breaks

its neck, and starts plucking it.  The OTHERS continue

their bitter conversation.

The COOK starts laughing.  They turn to him.

They all laugh.  Alonso looks up at COLUMBUS standing on

the poop deck, scrutinizing the horizon, waiting for the

land to appear.

MENDEZ has sensed the danger of this lack of respect.  He

approaches them.

They split in silence.

EXT.  SANTA MARIA - DECK - NIGHT

The SHIP is plowing on, pushed by a hot wind -- SAILORS

sleep on deck.

The SHIP'S BOY is singing to himself.  Despite his hair

lip he has a pure, melancholy voice...

COLUMBUS, leaning over the prow rail, staring ahead, hears

it carry over the darkness.

EXT.  SANTA MARIA - DECK - DAY

CLOSE UP ON AN HOUR-GLASS, nearly through its time.

The SHIP'S BOY throws an "ampoulette" over board.  We

follow the bulb attached to a rope, passing the full

length of the hull.  As it reaches the poop deck, another

SAILOR shouts "MARK".  A very primitive system of

calculation for distance and speed.

Sitting near the SHIP'S BOY, COLUMBUS is making entries in

a log-book, watching the hourglass.

THE HOUR-GLASS runs out.  COLUMBUS converts the mark into

a daily average for distance and speed.

THE SHIP'S BOY cups his hands to his mouth to shout.

EXT.  PINTA - DAY

PINZON, his OFFICERS beside him, looks across at the SANTA

MARIA.

AN OFFICER turns to PINZON to repeat the message.

PINZON does not seem too pleased.

THE OFFICER examines his own calculations.

He goes back to his cabin.

EXT.  SHIPS - SARGASSO SEA - DAY

ABSOLUTE STILLNESS.  A FURNACE.  The three ships like

dots, on what seems to be a prairie of weed.

The caravels are being towed by three rowing boats.

CLOSE ON THE MEN, rowing, drenched with sweat.

FROM THE PROW, COLUMBUS is staring at the horizon.

ALONSO pulling at his oars stares at COLUMBUS' distant

figure with hate and resentment.

ALONSO suddenly ships his oars, throwing the whole boat

into disarray.  Chaos.

Total silence.  MENDEZ and ALONSO stare at each other.

ALONSO defiantly stares at MENDEZ.  He then starts to beat

a rhythm on the hull with his fist, followed by the

others.  In the two other boats, the MEN begin to follow

suit, beating a rhythm of protest on the hulls.

MENDEZ looks up to COLUMBUS, in panic.

ON BOARD PINZON'S SHIP, an OFFICER cups his hands to his

mouth.

EXT.  SANTA MARIA - DAY

INT.  COLUMBUS' CABIN - DAY

PINZON enters.  He looks furious.

COLUMBUS moves to the door.  As an afterthought, he takes

his scarlet-embroidered jacket from a hook.

EXT.  SANTA MARIA - DECK - DAY

Most of the men are now back on board.

They go silent as COLUMBUS appears.  He walks slowly over

to them.  All, including ALONSO, are surly, threatening...

He looks up and down the line, finishing on ALONSO.  They

stare at one another.

Some of the MEN murmur their agreement.

ALONSO glances towards the SHIP'S BOY, with his hair lip.

The BOY lowers his eyes.  COLUMBUS moves towards him,

pulls him forward, stands him in front of ALONSO.

Some of the men laugh at this statement.  ALONSO is ill at

ease.  COLUMBUS pauses, looks around at all the MEN.

The MEN are listening.  We sense a subtle change of

mood...

COLUMBUS points at the SHIP'S BOY.

The SHIP'S BOY rushes up the mast.  As he climbs, the

mainsail starts to fill with wind.  The deck begins to

move under their feet.

This movement under their feet seems to imperceptibly

erase the fears and the angers.

CRIES from the other ships, as the sails snap taut,

filling with wind.  MEN rush to their posts.  PINZON

stares at COLUMBUS, shaking his head in disbelief.

COLUMBUS walks away to his cabin, then turning back to

PINZON.

Turning abruptly, he enters his cabin.

EXT.  SANTA MARIA - PROW - MISTY NIGHT

COLUMBUS is seated, isolated at the prow, wrapped in his

cape, struggling against the sleep.  MENDEZ approaches him

with a bowl of soup.

COLUMBUS shakes his head no, and starts drinking from the

bowl.

COLUMBUS' head nods lower and lower to his chest.  He is

asleep.  We become aware of a sharp buzzing sound.  It

becomes louder as we move closer to COLUMBUS' face.

A mosquito lands on his temple.  COLUMBUS reflexively

slaps it.  He wakes up, and looks at his fingers -- a spot

of blood, a crushed mosquito.  He stares at it for a

moment.  Then slowly gets to his feet.

EXT.  SANTA MARIA - DECK - NIGHT

In the luminous moonlight, COLUMBUS is standing, staring

up at thousands of insects that wheel around the mast

lantern.  We hear the flutter of their wings and see the

bats as they swoop and dive in a feeding frenzy.

COLUMBUS turns, stares into the darkness, desperate to see

the land that must be close.

He kneels by MENDEZ, wrapped in a blanket.  He touches his

shoulder.

MENDEZ grimaces, and opens one eye.

EXT.  SHIP - DAWN

An opaque dawn.  COLUMBUS, riveted, staring forward as if

to pierce the mist.  The entire crew are clinging to the

rail, and standing on the shrouds.

Suddenly, the SHIP BOY'S voice cracking with emotion.

COLUMBUS strains his eyes; he still can not see anything.

The entire CREW stand and stare, silent, holding their

breath.

As the sun begins to rise, the fog dissipates -- slowly,

exquisitely, revealing a single palm, so close it seems

almost as though they could touch it.  Then a white slash

of beach.

Near COLUMBUS, a SAILOR falls to his knees and burst into

tears.  Others laugh with joy.  COLUMBUS watches this

vision in disbelief, his mouth open as if it were

difficult for him to breathe.  Tears come to his eyes.  He

closes them.  Then opens them again.  The land is there --

a green paradise.

On screen the words:  OCTOBER 12, 1942.  GUANAHAN ISLAND

EXT.  BOATS - DAY

Three row boats plunging through the surf towards the

beach.  COLUMBUS stands in the prow of the first boat.

MENDEZ is in the second.  PINZON the third.  They stare

entranced at the lushness of the foliage, and the blue

clarity of the water...

As the first boat beaches, COLUMBUS leaps out and wades

ashore.  Behind him the rest of the landing party splash

through the sun-dazzled water, carrying the banner of

Castille and Aragon.

EXT.  BEACH - DAY

They stand on the beach, almost in a dream.  There is

silence.  The ROYAL NOTARY, ludicrously overdressed, now

wet through, stumbles over to COLUMBUS and holds out his

contract and a pen.  COLUMBUS scrawls his name.

The MEN stare at him, filled not only with new respect,

but with something amounting to awe.

COLUMBUS turns to them, tries to speak.

He swallows.  Tears have sprung to his eyes.  He is so

moved he cannot continue.  Coming to his rescue -- THE

SHIP'S BOY starts to roll the drum.  He then stops.

The MEN cheer as the flags are rammed into the sand,

flapping in the wind.

COLUMBUS starts to walk towards the jungle, and in silence

the rest follow.

EXT.  JUNGLE - DAY

Immediately they are met by an incredible wall of SOUND!

The jungle is filled with NOISE.  The impossibly-loud

CRIES of EXOTIC BIRDS, the CHATTERING of MONKEYS.  The

SPANIARDS are overwhelmed.

They move forward.  Rays of sunlight pierce through the

high canopy of leaves, like the roof of a magnificent

cathedral.  The sounds and smells intoxicate their senses.

They are filled with wonder.

Then PINZON stops.  He has seen something.  Another stops,

then a third, staring ahead of them...

Several of them raise their weapons to their shoulders,

pointing them into the jungle.

From COLUMBUS' POV we slowly scan the face of the thick

jungle ahead.  For a moment we don't see anything -- and

then, with a shock, we see the first INDIAN.  Naked,

painted like an idol, carrying a hunting lance.

As if they had materialized from nowhere:  the rest of the

HUNTING PARTY, with their bows and spears.  Silent.

Watchful.  They stare back at us.

The SPANIARDS nervously finger their weapons.

COLUMBUS slowly lifts his hand into the air:  a clear

signal not to fire.  Then, removing his sword, he drops it

on the ground, and starts to walk forward, fixing his gaze

upon the first INDIAN he saw.

COLUMBUS ignores him, even though some of the INDIANS have

raised their weapons.  He stops in the no-man's land

between them.  The INDIANS don't move -- but something

excites them.

The SHIP'S BOY, wearing COLUMBUS' embroidered jacket and

the drum, has followed COLUMBUS and now stands close to

him.  He is the cause of their interest.  COLUMBUS puts

his arm around the BOY, and this gesture of affection

seems to put the INDIANS at their ease.  They start

talking and pointing.  They come forward slowly, start to

tentatively touch the BOY'S jacket.  Then, now laughing,

they touch COLUMBUS, pulling at his beard.  COLUMBUS

laughs too.

Sensing their innocence, the rest of the MEN lower their

weapons.  Some of them laugh.

An apparition:  a beautiful young INDIAN GIRL, totally

naked, walks out of the jungle.

She is pregnant and holds a child.  We begin to hear

Indian music, played on a flute.

EXT.  INDIAN VILLAGE - DAY

A large post is lifted from the ground by two SPANIARDS

pulling on ropes.  The post is fixed into position -- and

then we see that it is a large wooden cross... The INDIAN

VILLAGERS watch the ceremony with some interest and

amusement.

COLUMBUS looks over at the men and gestures at the

INDIANS.

EXT.  VILLAGE - SUNSET

The smoke from fires.  Laughter.  Music playing.  The

INDIANS have prepared food for the SPANIARDS, who are

drinking and enjoying themselves in this strange world.

COLUMBUS sits with MENDEZ, PINZON, the INDIAN CHIEF,

ELDERS OF THE VILLAGE.  Other INDIANS stand around,

smiling, curious.

The INDIANS talk among themselves.  The ELDERS smoke

primitive cigars -- and offer them, with good humor, to

their guests.  The SPANIARDS cough and choke at first...

and laugh.  In return, they offer the INDIANS wine...

Dogs roam around the campfires.  The WOMEN openly suckle

their babies.  The MEN are entranced.

PINZON draws out attention, for the first time, to a small

gold ornament on the nose of one of the INDIANS.  He

points to it, indicates his interest in it.

The INDIANS says the word in his own language, laughing.

We see that some of the other INDIANS also have small gold

ornaments.

PINZON repeats the INDIAN word for gold.  The INDIAN

removes the ornament from his nose, gives it to PINZON,

who indicates that he wants to have it.  The INDIAN nods

-- but points to PINZON'S dagger, indicating that he wants

it in return.  PINZON shakes his head, stops the INDIAN

from taking it.

PINZON looks at him, about to argue -- but COLUMBUS

insists.  PINZON takes out the dagger and offers it to the

INDIAN.

His friends laugh.  Innocently, the INDIAN has taken it by

the blade.  He yelps, looks down at the blood welling

up... A moment of tension... Then MENDEZ laughs at his

clumsiness, and the ELDERS laugh too... and the INDIAN

laughs.

Just outside this circle, we see the first INDIAN we saw,

squatting on his haunches, watching.  This is UTAPAN.

INT.  TENT - DAWN

The first light outside -- the strange, wonderful sounds

of the jungle all around.  COLUMBUS writes in his journal.

He looks up.  UTAPAN is squatting in the doorway of the

hut.  He's been there all night.  COLUMBUS takes more ink

on his quill and begins to sketch UTAPAN'S face in the

margin of his log-book.  He draws well.

He gets up and walks over to UTAPAN and shows him the

drawing.  It's an electrifying moment.  UTAPAN is shocked

and amazed.  At first he is rather frightened of his own

image... Then he is happy, and laughs... and COLUMBUS

laughs with him and puts a hand on his shoulder in a

gesture of friendship.

UTAPAN gets up, and indicates that he too has something he

wishes to offer.

EXT.  JUNGLE - MORNING

UTAPAN expertly scampering through the jungle.  COLUMBUS

follows him.

UTAPAN orders COLUMBUS to sit.  COLUMBUS obeys.  UTAPAN

looks up at the tops of the trees.  The sun is rising, and

filters through the foliage.  As if the time had come,

UTAPAN stands up, and COLUMBUS does the same.

A gap in the dense vegetation.  Something is glittering.

Gold.  A mass of gold.  As they approach, COLUMBUS

discovers --

A large pool of fresh water.  The morning sunlight has

turned the water into liquid gold.  The surface ripples

with the breeze.  UTAPAN smiles.  It the stranger

satisfied?  Isn't this what he came for?

COLUMBUS plunges into the pool.  As he emerges, he fills

his palms with liquid gold.

EXT.  RIVER - DAY

Wide shot -- A flotilla of canoes are going upstream.

INDIANS AND SPANIARDS are traveling together in the

canoes.  UTAPAN leads the expedition in COLUMBUS' craft.

THE SHIP BOY'S cranium is shaved like UTAPAN'S, and we

notice that some other crew members are beardless, some

even wearing tribal patterns.

EXT.  RIVERSIDE - DAY

INDIAN VILLAGERS confronting the SPANIARDS, UTAPAN talks

to an ELDER MAN, watched by COLUMBUS, MENDEZ and PINZON.

UTAPAN repeats several times the word for GOLD, showing

some artifacts.  The OLD INDIAN shakes his head no,

indicating another distant place.

THE OLD MAN nods, points into the distance, chatters away

to UTAPAN.

EXT.  SANTA MARIA - DECK - DAY

Standing at the prow of the ship, his long dark hair

floating in the wind, UTAPAN rejoicing at the speed.

EXT.  THICK JUNGLE - CUBA - DAY

Led by UTAPAN, the SPANIARDS hack their way through thick

jungle.  It's hard work.  The MEN sweat.  This is

inhospitable terrain.  Even the noises of the jungle seem

somehow more sinister...

RESTING PLACE - ALONSO is seated under a tree.  He takes

off his boot, and grabs his foot, examining the blisters

on his toes.  As he puts his foot back into the boot, he

jumps screaming in pain.

ALONSO yelps, grasping his ankle.

CLOSE ON a snake sliding out of the empty boot.

While his COMPANIONS rush to him, a SAILOR spots the

snake, and decapitates it with his sword.  UTAPAN glances

at the dead snake.  He then goes and kneels -- he sees the

bite on ALONSO'S ankle.

ALONSO is quiet and silent.  His eyes are looking around

at his companions.  UTAPAN shakes his head.  There is

nothing he can do.

ALONSO is now leaning back, supported by one of his

friends.  He has grabbed the forearm of a SAILOR.  His

look is already far away.  His companion shouts at UTAPAN.

ALONSO starts convulsing.  HIS FRIENDS hold him, desperate

in their helplessness.  Others simply move away,

horrified.  One of them cries.

EXT.  RIVER - DAY

Standing in the stream up to his thighs, A SPANIARD (a

gold expert) examines some stones.  He then looks up at

COLUMBUS and PINZON and just throws the stones back into

the water without a word.

The group of SPANIARDS are resting, exhausted by the

humidity.  Some are drinking from the river, others soak

bandanas, and tie them around their necks...

One after another, they stand up slowly -- they look

discouraged, tired, and beaten.

EXT.  MOUNTAINOUS JUNGLE - DAY

UTAPAN and the SPANIARDS are trekking in the hills.  Fully

armed, they are now suffering intensely from the heat and

the vicious insect bites.

COLUMBUS doggedly keeps up with UTAPAN, who tirelessly

trots forward.

Finally, COLUMBUS turns around and sees... nobody.  He

calls out to UTAPAN.

UTAPAN stops obediently, and rushes back to COLUMBUS with

comical energy.

On their way back, they find one SOLDIER sitting, leaning

against a tree.  He has removed his helmet.  His hair

sticking to his forehead.

As COLUMBUS and UTAPAN walk back, they find another

SAILOR, then another, then the whole group gathered around

PINZON.  Ashen, he burns with fever.  He attempts a smile.

COLUMBUS looks around him -- what he sees:  exhausted men

and jungle, as far as one can see.

PINZON grins.

They all laugh as the OFFICER helps PINZON to his feet.

PINZON walks a few yards into the jungle -- starts to

urinate.  It is red.  Suddenly dizzy, he reels and

collapses.

EXT.  JUNGLE - DAY

A line of SPANIARDS and INDIANS threading their way down a

mountainside.  PINZON is being carried on a makeshift

stretcher.  His eyes are closed, his face thick with

sweat.

They enter a village, to the surprise of the INDIANS.

UTAPAN once again at the front as the ambassador.

INT.  HUT - NIGHT

A INDIAN SHAMAN is forcing a milky fluid into PINZON'S

mouth.  COLUMBUS attempts a gesture to prevent him.  But

UTAPAN stops him.

COLUMBUS nods -- he obviously trusts UTAPAN.

INT.  CHIEF GUARIONEX'S HUT - NIGHT

In the half-light, figures wreathed in smoke -- COLUMBUS,

MENDEZ and UTAPAN watch the CHIEF GUARIONEX putting a

Spanish helmet on his head.  The helmet is too big, almost

covering his eyes.  The ELDERS appraise the gift with

solemn wonder.

In return, GUARIONEX hands COLUMBUS a parcel made of

leaves.  COLUMBUS unwraps them.  Inside:  a GOLD grimacing

mask.  The first real piece of gold.  COLUMBUS is unable

to conceal his excitement at this first real evidence of

the metal.

He waits for the CHIEF to speak, but the CHIEF only looks

at him.  On the ground, we see other presents offered by

the SPANIARDS -- trinkets, and necklaces...

UTAPAN translates.

UTAPAN translates.  The CHIEF GUARIONEX asks a simple

question.

COLUMBUS doesn't seem to understand the question.  For the

first time he seems to be caught short.

UTAPAN translates.

And the CHIEF gets up, awards COLUMBUS with a smile, and

walks out of the hut, the ELDERS following, leaving

COLUMBUS alone.

EXT.  SHORE - DAY

Watched from the shore by the INDIANS and by about forty

of the SPANIARDS, who are staying behind, the boats pull

out towards the two remaining ships.

PINZON is laid out in the bottom of the boat.  COLUMBUS,

UTAPAN, and four other INDIANS are in the same boat.

The boats continue to pull away, the figures on the shore

growing smaller.

EXT.  COLUMBUS' CABIN - NIGHT

CLOSE ON:  a golden mask... the lamp in the cabin swings

violently back and forth, creating strange shadows, as if

the mask was alive... COLUMBUS is writing with difficulty

in his log-book.

Suddenly the cabin seems to lurch over.  Things fall from

the table, smashing on the floor... COLUMBUS nearly falls.

EXT.  SEA - NIGHT

We are in the middle of a violent storm -- of terrifying

proportions.  The thunder is deafening.  Light irradiates

the darkness.  We see the two caravels, dwarfed by the

massive seas.

EXT.  DECK - NIGHT

Five MEN are struggling to lash down the tiller.  The deck

jumps and rolls.  It rises five meters into the air then

falls into space and hits the water with a terrible crack.

Waves sweep over the decks.  We hear desperate cries for

mercy from the terrified crew, loud enough to be heard

above the storm.

COLUMBUS and MENDEZ are crawling towards the mast, along a

lifeline.

The MEN start to scramble below decks.

The ship rolls again.  COLUMBUS and MENDEZ crawl towards

the mast.  Another gigantic wave crashes over them, tons

of water falling like cement.  They reach the mast.  The

wood groans.

MENDEZ nods... COLUMBUS grabs some rope.  The ship rises

into the air again, crashes down, the deck disappearing

beneath them for a moment.

With MENDEZ'S help, COLUMBUS is tied to the mast:  one

rope under his arms, the other around his waist.  MENDEZ

hands him a horn.

MENDEZ seems to hesitate.  COLUMBUS screams at him again.

MENDEZ crawls away.

Another huge wave washes over COLUMBUS.  He emerges,

almost suffocated.  The storm rages, its eerie light

making it seem at times like bright daylight.  But as the

lightning flashes, COLUMBUS begins to count:

There's an enormous thunderclap on "four" -- it indicates

how close they are to the eye of the storm.

The ship keels over again, dropping down and down, seeming

never to rise... COLUMBUS lifts his head to the heavens,

screams out:

As if in answer, another flash of lightning that

illuminates the sky and the sea.  COLUMBUS starts counting

again.

Another terrible clap of thunder on "five" -- COLUMBUS

starts laughing, knowing the storm is moving on.

Then, in the strange light, something seems to move

through the air towards him; it looks like some kind of

projectile, a craft, with a trail of vapor.

COLUMBUS stares up at it... amazed.  We start to hear the

"Te Deum", majestic and heavenly.

INT.  CATHEDRAL OF CORDOBA - SPAIN - DAY

COLUMBUS looks up at the vast roof, to see an incense

burner, swinging, gliding swiftly across the ceiling,

trailing a think vapor of incense.

A magnificent "Te Deum" is being sung -- in honor of

COLUMBUS' achievements and return.  The whole cathedral is

packed with nobles and dignitaries in their gorgeous

robes.

BEATRIX, FERNANDO and DIEGO are staring in fascination at

COLUMBUS' triumph -- somewhat separated by the grandeur of

this occasion.  COLUMBUS passes by, walking proudly down

the long central alley, beside KING FERDINAND and QUEEN

ISABEL and other GRANDEES.  He turns to his family,

keeping his eyes on BEATRIX until she is out of his

vision.

The procession is followed by UTAPAN, and other INDIANS in

tribal regalia...

As they move through the crowds, all eyes are upon

COLUMBUS.

INT.  ROOM - SEVILLE (PINZON'S DEATH) - DAY

In a simple room, a PRIEST finishes giving the Last Rites

and a sheet is pulled over the head of MARTIN PINZON.  His

WIFE and CHILDREN weep at the bedside.

INT.  CATHEDRAL - DAY

A stool passes from hands to hands.  It is placed at the

Queen and King's side.  COLUMBUS sits on it -- a supreme

privilege.

To one side sit AROJAZ and SANCHEZ.  AROJAZ leans over to

whisper to him.

INT.  ALCAZAR'S PALACE IN SEVILLE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

CLOSE ON:  the face of a young, SPANISH NOBLEMAN, ADRIAN

DE MOXICA.  Hesitantly, he brings a lighted cigar to his

lips -- then pauses.

We discover other people around the magnificent candle-lit

table.  NOBLE MEN and NOBLE WOMEN.  SANCHEZ.  COLUMBUS.

QUEEN ISABEL.

COLUMBUS takes the cigar from MOXICA.  The rest watch him

with rapt curiosity.  COLUMBUS inhales deeply then, to

their astonishment, blows out the smoke through his nose.

He hands the cigar back to MOXICA.  With a casual air,

MOXICA himself inhales deeply -- almost chokes to death.

He gulps down a glass of wine... much to the amusement of

the others.

ISABEL blushes slightly.

COLUMBUS nods, turns and whispers something to a SERVANT

standing just behind his chair.  The SERVANT goes to open

the door -- and in comes UTAPAN, dressed as a tribesman,

carrying a casket.  The WOMEN around the table fan

themselves furiously at the sight.  UTAPAN puts the casket

down in front of the QUEEN, and steps back.

ISABEL opens the casket, revealing the gleam of gold

inside.  She takes out some of the little golden

ornaments... a bracelet and then the mask.

She holds it, somehow moved by its crude beauty.

ISABEL raises the mask to her face, looking across at

COLUMBUS.

The image is somehow powerful enough to reduce even the

ARISTOCRATS to silence.  She speaks from behind the mask.

The guests laugh obsequiously.  COLUMBUS bows a little --

looks up and meets the eyes of SANCHEZ, who is staring at

him, coldly.

INT.  ROTUNDA - DAY

A SWORD MASTER advances towards us with determination, his

sword flashing.  He is fighting an adversary we do not

see, and comments his movements.

We discover the SWORD MASTER is fencing with COLUMBUS.  A

dozen duellists are practicing in the magnificent rotunda,

surrounded with a two-tiered colonnade.

Out of breath, COLUMBUS stops the exercise, and removes

his protective canvas padding.  He bows at his teacher,

who salutes him in return.

COLUMBUS walks to a tressel laden with food and beverages.

SANCHEZ, in a fencing outfit and boots, is having a glass

of wine.  Upon seeing COLUMBUS approaching, he hands him a

glass.

SANCHEZ laughs and raises his glass.

They drink.  A short, somewhat ugly man, with some kind of

imposing energy, approach them.

BOBADILLA bows.

SANCHEZ looks at him in surprise.  BOBADILLA reddens.

BOBADILLA glances at SANCHEZ.

A grin disfigures the face of BOBADILLA.

And he walks off.  SANCHEZ fills his mouth with a slice of

ham.

INT.  ROOM - ADMINISTRATION - DAY

COLUMBUS with two MEN:  the oldest, around thirty, is a

strong-looking man.  The youngest, no more than twenty

five, is thin and fit.  There is obvious tension in the

room.  These are BARTOLOME and GIACOMO COLON, COLUMBUS'

brothers.  BARTOLOME is angry, and GIACOMO thoughtful.

COLUMBUS looks at them with such pained surprise...

He opens the door to a terrace.

EXT.  GALLERY - DAY

The large gallery courtyard is crowded with PEOPLE --

applicants for the voyage.  As COLUMBUS appears, they all

press forward, calling out his name, trying to get his

attention, touching his sleeves as if he were a saint.

They crowd around COLUMBUS and his BROTHERS.  COLUMBUS

nods, murmurs vaguely, here and there...

Fighting their way through, the BOTHERS press their way,

reaching the other side of the gallery.  We get glimpses

of the incredible activity down below.  ADMINISTRATORS,

MILITARIES, MERCHANTS are busy around tressels covered

with documents, plans, maps... preparing the second

expedition.

COLUMBUS puts his arms around them.

He walks then to the balustrade.  The cries from the

courtyard down below subside... some of the applicants

begin to look up, aware of his presence.

Everybody laughs.

He leans over the balcony.  In the middle of the

overcrowded courtyard, the SOLDIER who was shouting is

brandishing a document.

ANOTHER ASSISTANT raises his eyes.

The whole courtyard bursts out laughing.

EXT.  ORANGERY - VICEROY'S HOUSE - DAY

UTAPAN is lying in his hammock.  FERNANDO turns him over.

UTAPAN falls to the ground.

COLUMBUS walks beside BEATRIX.

BEATRIX smiles, nods.  They walk on.

BEATRIX stops in her tracks, looks at him.

BEATRIX nods, but bites her lip, and looks back at

FERNANDO.

COLUMBUS puts his arm around her waist, pulling her

closer, they move away.

EXT.  FAR END OF THE ORANGERY - DAY

FERNANDO is now swinging expertly in the hammock.  UTAPAN

is pushing him gently.  He slowly straightens up to watch

COLUMBUS and BEATRIX disappear, somehow sensing there is a

dilemma.  FERNANDO noticing UTAPAN'S reaction, turns to

his parents.  The arbor is empty.  FERNANDO becomes

pensive.

We become aware of the rustling of the jungle.

EXT.  BEACH AND EDGE OF JUNGLE - DAY

FIFTEEN HUNDRED MEN spread along the beach, looking

towards the jungle.  COLUMBUS stands beside his BROTHERS,

and MENDEZ, and UTAPAN.

MOXICA, astride a magnificent black horse, prances back

and forth across the sand.  All are waiting.

A signal cannon is fired from one of the ships.  Birds

scatter into the air from the jungle -- but then silence,

complete and ominous.  COLUMBUS stares into the jungle.

Nothing.  No one to greet them -- no welcoming party from

the MEN they left behind.

COLUMBUS glances at MENDEZ.

MENDEZ looks at him, but can't answer.

MOXICA suddenly spurs on his horse, and guides it into the

trees.  The order is given for the rest to follow, fanning

out as they do so, weapons at the ready.

EXT.  CLEARING - JUNGLE - DAY

Ruins.  The camp has been burned to ashes.  A strange

sight:  arrows are stuck vertically into the ground, each

with a moldering tuft of human hair attached to the

flight.

In silence the SOLDIERS pick their way through the

devastation.

The ground is littered with coconuts.  Kicking one over

with his shoe, a SOLDIER discovers that his coconut is

actually a human skull.  The gaping mouth has been filled

to the brim with gold.

But of the living, there is no sign.

COLUMBUS looks around in dismay.  A YOUNG NOBLEMAN,

HERNANDO DE GUEVARA, takes out his sword.

Other SPANIARDS join in, repeating this last word.

Silence.  Everyone looks at COLUMBUS.

They are all listening.

He walks among them.

EXT.  INDIAN VILLAGE - DAY

MOXICA mounted on his magnificent BLACK STALLION canters

to the edge of the deserted village and enters the

village.  UTAPAN is terrorized by the absence of anything

living.

All we can hear is the breathing of the horse.  The

animal, an impressive mass of muscle, prances nervously.

UTAPAN calls out in dialect.

Slowly, they begin to appear, one after the other --

materializing from the jungle.  Shy and scared.

They stare at this "Centaur" (the HORSE and the HORSEMAN

seem to be one -- a God).

To impress them even more, MOXICA makes the beast move

sideways and backwards, rearing, its front hoofs pawing

the air.  THE INDIANS retreat in terror, except for one,

who stands his ground, brandishing his lance.

UTAPAN encourages the YOUNG WARRIOR to approach the

centaur.  He places his hand onto the shoulder of the

animal.  The muscles shudder.  THE INDIAN jumps back

comically, accompanied by the rest of the tribe.

Without warning, MOXICA climbs down from the saddle.  More

INDIANS step back in fear and absolute astonishment.  Now

more have ventured from the jungle.  The bravest of them

approach MOXICA, daring to touch him, and the horse,

retreating then touching until they fill the compound.

At this moment, COLUMBUS and his SOLDIERS appear all

around them, pointing their muskets, and their crossbows.

A moment of tension.

COLUMBUS walks forward, towards the CHIEF (GUARIONEX) we

meet before.

The CHIEF answers.

A pause.  The SPANIARDS shifting, eager for blood.

UTAPAN looks anxiously at COLUMBUS.

UTAPAN translates.  The CHIEF listens in silence.

EXT.  WATERMILL AND DAM UNDER CONSTRUCTION - DAY

It is raining hard.  COLUMBUS is floundering in the mud,

supervising a mixed work-force of SPANISH and INDIANS.

They are attempting to raise the huge wheel of a

watermill.

Despite COLUMBUS' shouts of encouragement, it's clear the

wheel is far too heavy and the mud too deep.

Close by, on horseback, MOXICA watches the scene.

COLUMBUS, plastered with wet mud, clambers out of the pit

and approaches him.

MOXICA looks down at the sodden, dirty figure.

A beat.  COLUMBUS wipes some mud from his eyes.

He starts to turn away; COLUMBUS grabs hold of the reins.

A beat.  MOXICA stares down at an equally determined

COLUMBUS.  Then, in front of everyone, MOXICA has to

dismount, and suffer the disgrace of it.

COLUMBUS leads the horse away.

EXT.  WATERMILL AND DAM UNDER CONSTRUCTION - DAY

Harnessed, the horse pulls, with COLUMBUS and the MEN.

The wheel is raised into position.

EXT.  WATERMILL AND DAM - DAY

Water thundering into the new canal.  The huge wheel

begins to turn.  The MEN cheer and congratulate each

other.  MOXICA looks at his mud-splattered and foaming

horse, his eyes full of hatred.

EXT.  CITY OF ISABEL - TWILIGHT

A wide, high shot of the new "City", dominated by a huge

wooden cross -- no more than a muddy main street bordered

by a hundred bamboo and stone shanties, with candles

burning in the doorways.  A main square with the

Governor's Mansion, and the foundations of a church.

In the twilight, COLUMBUS and the other WORKERS returning,

dirty and tired.

EXT.  VERANDA OF MOXICA'S HOUSE - TWILIGHT

MOXICA and GUEVARA sit out on the "veranda", watching the

MEN return.  MOXICA raises his glass in an ironic salute.

They laugh.  We see the smoke and flames from a fire.

Four or five INDIANS are squatting on the earth nearby,

cooking for them, talking quietly in their own language.

MOXICA calls out something in their language, and a naked

YOUNG INDIAN GIRL comes out of the house, bringing more

wine.  GUEVARA stares at her lasciviously.  MOXICA,

letting his hand casually brush against her flank, smiles

at him.

He turns the GIRL round so that GUEVARA can admire her

properly.  GUEVARA nods.  MOXICA lets the GIRL go with a

peremptory order, and she disappears back inside.

GUEVARA suddenly stands up -- unsteadily -- and sweeping

his arm round in a broad gesture, says ironically:

INT.  DINING ROOM - GOVERNOR'S MANSION - NIGHT

In an already Spanish-colonel dining room, COLUMBUS is

having dinner with his brothers, BARTOLOME and GIACOMO,

served by an INDIAN WOMAN -- NIMA.  GIACOMO eats with

gusto.

Seeing GIACOMO'S sudden blush and discomfort, as NIMA

smiles at him, the other BROTHERS laugh.

To cover his embarrassment, GIACOMO returns to the topic

of the food.

As he sees BARTOLOME stifling a laugh, GIACOMO pauses.

COLUMBUS eats a mouthful, glances at BARTOLOME.

A look of horror crosses GIACOMO'S face; he wretches

slightly, puts down his fork, and gulps down some wine.

The BROTHERS laugh again.

Reluctantly this time, GIACOMO goes back to his dinner.

EXT.  BALCONY - GOVERNOR'S MANSION - NIGHT

They are drinking and smoking cigars.  From the balcony

they can see the dark mass of the jungle stretching away.

GIACOMO is already dozing in his chair.  BARTOLOME sees

it, and elbows COLUMBUS.  They both smile at their younger

brother's exhaustion.  Then COLUMBUS gets up and leans on

the balustrade, looking down at the city, the jungle

beyond.

They begin to hear the sound of a flute -- a melancholy

sound.  COLUMBUS looks out over the jungle, and kills a

mosquito by slapping his arm.

INT.  INFIRMARY - CITY OF ISABEL - NIGHT

An INDIAN is playing the flute.

In the gloomy interior of the long hut, in the most

primitive conditions, DOZENS OF SPANIARDS lie sick.  On a

segregated part of the room are the INDIANS, several

coughing.

They are attended by a doctor, DOCTOR CHANCA, BROTHER

BUYL, and other NOVICES.

A NOVICE attends to an INDIAN, gently lifting his head,

helping him to drink -- there is so little they can do.

BROTHER BUYL looks down at the body of a SPANIARD, covered

in open sores.  The NOVICE joins him.

EXT.  ROYAL HOSPITAL - COURTYARD - SPAIN - DAY

A MAN covered with sores is screaming, thrashing in his

agony.  He is held down, his voice muffled.  ISABEL turns

away, shocked.

She is in a ward full of patients, attended by a DOCTOR,

SANCHEZ and other members of her court.

The patients are emaciated, their faces and bodies covered

with virulent sores.  NUNS move between the beds.

ISABEL looks around at SANCHEZ, appalled.

SANCHEZ bows in acknowledgement.  But ISABEL, despite her

words, looks distressed.

EXT.  MINE - NEW WORLD - DAY

Excavations carved into a hillside.

It is a blisteringly hot day.  At the foot of the hill,

GIACOMO sits at a table beneath an awning, with MOXICA and

several CLERKS.  ONE HUNDRED FIFTY INDIANS standing in

line at the table.

In turn, they hand over a small quantity of gold.  The

CLERK weighs it on a scale, and notes down each

contribution.

MOXICA impatiently gestures the INDIANS to move faster

with a thonged crop.  An INDIAN approaches the table.  He

is nervous.  He doesn't produce anything.  The INDIAN

shakes his head, gesticulates, starts to speak rapidly.

Again the INDIAN pleads and gesticulates.  MOXICA hits him

across the face with the thonged crop.  The INDIAN tries

to run away -- but is held by a SPANISH SOLDIER.

The frightened INDIAN is brought back to the table.  One

of the CLERKS slips away.

EXT.  OTHER SIDE OF THE SITE - DAY

At the other end of the site, the CLERK sprinting to

GIACOMO, who was talking to a FOREMASTER.

EXT.  MINE - DAY

MOXICA turns, looks back at the long line of INDIANS,

still passively waiting.

The terrified TRANSLATOR speaks to the INDIANS.

GIACOMO and the CLERK running to the scene.

With a single swift action, MOXICA draws his sword and

cuts off the INDIAN'S hands.

ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE.  The INDIANS flee, disappearing

into the jungle.  GIACOMO arrives at this moment.  He

stares at the dismembered hands in horror.

INT.  GOVERNOR'S MANSION - EVENING

A tribunal.  Sitting behind a table with his brothers, and

flanked by his council, COLUMBUS presides.  MOXICA stands

before them.

He strolls to the GUARDS at the back of the room.

EXT.  BARRACKS - NIGHT

Everything is quiet on the mine site.

On the terrace, TWO SOLDIERS are drinking in turn, and

cracking jokes.  One of them leans against the wooden

wall.  He laughs as he hears repeated banging behind him.

INT.  BARRACKS - NIGHT

A THIRD SOLDIER is fucking an INDIAN WOMAN against the

wall.

EXT.  BARRACKS - NIGHT

On the terrace, his two COMPANIONS laugh and encourage

his efforts.

A whooshing sound.  An arrow embeds itself in the chest of

the SOLDIER who was leaning against the wall.  He is

nailed to the wood behind him.

THE OTHER SOLDIER stares at him, transfixed, until an

arrow pierces his throat.  He collapses, unable to cry

out for help.

INT.  BARRACKS - NIGHT

FOUR INDIANS in full warrior outfit, their faces painted,

burst into the room.  Still busy with the WOMAN, his eyes

facing the wall, the SOLDIER believes the intruders to be

his friends.

Discovering the FOUR TERRIFYING FIGURES staring at her,

the INDIAN WOMAN starts screaming and pushes back the

SOLDIER.  He turns around, jumps off the WOMAN, and starts

to scramble to the front door, trying to put on his

trousers.

THE FOUR INDIANS catch him, and force him to lay on the

ground.  THE MAN struggles, his eyes rolling in terror.

TWO INDIANS force his mouth open.  A THIRD ONE kneels and

starts stuffing it with gold dust.  THE SOLDIER chokes and

suffocates.

THE WOMAN still stands half naked against the wall,

terrified.  AN INDIAN takes his knife from his leggings,

slowly.  She starts sobbing and imploring in her language.

THE INDIAN slowly walks to her, and plants the knife in

the lower part of her belly.

EXT.  MINE - DAY

PAIRS of bloody red legs hanging still, high in the air.

Pulling back, we discover:

A DOZEN SPANIARDS have been crucified on the scaffolding

of the excavations.  Some hands and noses have been

removed.

UTAPAN is standing, uncomfortable among the SPANIARDS.

A SOLDIER removes a huge iron nail from a wrist.  One of

the CRUCIFIED BODIES is gently laid on the ground.  He is

still alive -- not for long.

COLUMBUS and BARTOLOME are silent with rage.

BARTOLOME turns to UTAPAN.

UTAPAN looks distraught -- this is the first time he is

being asked to do something against his own people.  He

looks up at COLUMBUS for help in confusion.

COLUMBUS is caught short.

UTAPAN nods.  He walks and takes an arrow.  He examines

it.

UTAPAN nods, uncomfortable.

EXT.  HILL AND VALLEY - DAY

Around a campfire, two dozen INDIANS are squatting.  They

are arguing over a musket and some woolen hats they stole

from the mine.  CLICK!  CLICK!  The INDIANS raise their

heads.  All around them, crossbows and muskets are pointed

at them.  Two INDIANS try to run away.  They are shot.

This sound triggers the SPANIARDS' response.  They start

shooting at random.  UTAPAN is horrified.  COLUMBUS stands

up shouting.

EXT.  GOVERNOR'S MANSION - NIGHT

MOXICA and a group of rebels (GUEVARA among them),

silently approach the entrance of the mansion.

A GUARD is stabbed and falls on his knees with a cry.

INT.  COLUMBUS' STUDY - GOVERNOR'S MANSION - NIGHT

MOXICA tears COLUMBUS' plans of the city from the wall.

On the table, the model of the future city.

Watched by the other ARISTOCRATS, MOXICA sets fire to the

parchment he has rolled up.  He blows the flames from the

torch onto the model.  Fire races up and down the streets

of the miniature, as if burning the city of Isabel.

A mad gleam in MOXICA'S eyes...

EXT.  SQUARE OF ISABEL - NIGHT

The half-burnt remains of the Mansion.  COLUMBUS stands in

the square, looking up at it.  Behind him, his SOLDIERS,

his BROTHERS and about thirty captured INDIANS.

GIACOMO walks slowly across the square.  COLUMBUS looks at

him in disbelief.

EXT.  RIVER BANK - JUNGLE - DAWN

COLUMBUS leads his party of SOLDIERS through the jungle,

looking for the MUTINEERS.

They reach the river -- scan the far bank.  Nothing.

COLUMBUS nods.  His MEN start to enter the river, led by a

HALBERDIER.

Others follow, wading across, their weapons held above

their heads.

A crossbow arrow pierces the HALBERDIER.  Without a cry he

falls forward into the water, and is carried away by the

current.

Two more MEN are hit.  One cries out, thrashes around in

the water, an arrow protruding from his side.  The river

stained with blood.

Still no sign of the enemy.  COLUMBUS' MEN nevertheless

start to return fire from the bank, creating a shield...

others continue to wade across the river.  A MUTINEER is

shot down from the branches of a tree...

The first MEN come ashore.  Musket fire.  An exchange of

arrows.  COLUMBUS is now wading across.  The MAN next to

him is killed, and carried away by the current.

Now, on the far shore, the enemy have shown themselves.

There is hand to hand fighting, with swords and other

weapons.  MOXICA kills one of COLUMBUS' men -- but his own

are outnumbered and outmatched.  Already, some are

beginning to surrender.

In the midst of the fighting, COLUMBUS, sword drawn, pulls

himself out of the river:  A MUTINEER lunges at him.

COLUMBUS kills him with a thrust of his sword -- and walks

forward into the jungle.  He spots MOXICA at the foot of a

cliff.

EXT.  JUNGLE CLIMB TO CLIFF TOP - DAY

MOXICA starts scrambling up the rocks behind him, with

COLUMBUS following.  The climb through the dense

undergrowth is so exhausting, they are now almost climbing

in slow motion.

EXT.  TOP OF CLIFF - DAY

MOXICA bursts out of the undergrowth.  He is at the edge

of emptiness, swept by a violent offshore wind.  He turns

frantically, to see COLUMBUS coming up behind him.

Knowing he is lost, MOXICA regains his natural arrogance.

He steps backwards towards the edge.

He takes another step backwards, as COLUMBUS moves towards

him.

He smiles, and steps back into space.

EXT.  ROCKS BELOW CLIFF TOP - DAY

His body falls, bounces off the rocks below, crashes into

the water.

EXT.  TOP OF CLIFF - DAY

COLUMBUS stares down as his body is swept away.

EXT.  SQUARE OF ISABEL - DAY

CLOSE ON COLUMBUS' expressionless face.

A MUTINEER -- his face is white, he is crying and

trembling.  His arms are tied behind his back.  He is held

fast, a rope is put around his neck.

COLUMBUS, sitting not far away beside his BROTHERS, gives

a signal.

Drums begin to beat.  BROTHER BUYL looks on impassive.

A grimace suddenly transform THE YOUNG MAN'S face.  He is

being garroted -- his throat crushed with a rope.  The

YOUNG MAN'S feet dance frenziedly.  We hear the choking.

The drums cease.  BROTHER BUYL crosses himself and murmurs

a prayer, deeply distraught.  GIACOMO has covered his

eyes.

A wider view shows the bodies of three other ARISTOCRATS

from the rebellion, attached to chairs affixed to a pole,

their heads straight, the rope still tight around their

necks.

Justice has been done.  The members of the COUNCIL rise in

silence, COLUMBUS stands up.

EXT.  ISABEL - QUAYSIDE - DAY

CLOSE ON several large wooden cages.  Inside we see the

INDIANS that COLUMBUS captured.  They are packed together.

They stare out with vacant eyes.  SOLDIERS guard them.  A

ship against the pier.  BUYL at his side, COLUMBUS stares

at the INDIANS.

BROTHER BUYL looks at him, almost with astonishment.

And he walks away.

EXT.  ISLAND - EVENING

Against the livid horizon, three black waterspouts join

the sky to the sea.  A gust of wind disturbs the roof of

the jungle.

INT.  GOVERNOR'S MANSION - EVENING

The wind grows stronger.  Doors bang inside the

building... a melancholy sound.

COLUMBUS sits on the balcony with his BROTHERS.  They are

silent.  After a few moments, COLUMBUS begins to speak

quietly, almost as if he were speaking to himself.

The BROTHERS do not answer.

EXT.  JUNGLE - NEAR ISABEL - NIGHT

UTAPAN begins to shave his head...

EXT.  BALCONY - GOVERNOR'S MANSION - DAWN

The sky is dark and threatening, the wind even stronger.

We find COLUMBUS where we left him, but now alone.  He has

sat here all night.

Shutters bang violently.

He looks up -- and sees a few yards from him:  the naked

FIGURE OF AN INDIAN, his face and body painted, staring at

him.  COLUMBUS realizes who it is...

UTAPAN is still and silent.  A strange and mysterious

figure now.

UTAPAN is gone.

EXT.  SQUARE - DAWN

The wind is whipping the trees now, stronger and stronger.

Groups of INDIANS look up at the sky.  Then, above the

sound of the wind, they hear another noise.  Like a

collective murmur, almost in one voice, the INDIANS

repeat, over and over.

With a loud thunderclap, the storm suddenly breaks.  In a

few seconds it has risen to violent proportions, and the

landscape is drenched in torrential rain.  The wind

doubles its strength... and all hell breaks loose...

EXT.  CITY OF ISABEL - DAY

The hurricane is full force.  Trees are being ripped up by

their roots.  Rivers of mud are washed down from the

hills, carrying everything away in their paths:  houses,

carts, equipment, horses...

EXT.  MINE - ISABEL - DAY

The mine workings flooded with mud...

EXT.  APPROACH TO DAM AND WATERFALL - DAY

COLUMBUS, BARTOLOME and MENDEZ struggle through the teeth

of the hurricane towards the dam.

EXT.  DAM - DAY

Timbers creak and strain.  COLUMBUS, BARTOLOME, MENDEZ and

a DOZEN other MEN are trying to save the dam.

Suddenly, frighteningly, the dam begins to crash.

The MEN scramble away as the dam wall buckles, and burst

open.  Water floods over them; a roaring torrent.  From

the bank, MENDEZ, BARTOLOME and COLUMBUS survey the ruins

of their dreams.

INT.  GOVERNOR'S PALACE - BEDROOM - DAY

COLUMBUS is stretched out on his bed, in his devastated

bedroom.  A column of ants is threading its way across the

floor, each ant carrying a piece of leaf.  Rain falls over

a table covered with documents.

COLUMBUS' face is covered in dried mud.

INT.  AUDIENCE ROOM - ALHAMBRA PALACE - DAY

We are back to the first scene.  In the vast, opulent,

glittering room, ISABEL listens impassively to the voice

of SANCHEZ.  Also present, other GRANDEES, representatives

of the church and state.

A pause.  ISABEL seems to struggle inwardly with her

emotions.  SANCHEZ waits, expressionless, but on the point

of victory.

EXT.  QUAYSIDE - ISABEL - DAY

We see a buckled shoe -- as it rises, it slips into a

stirrup.  The horse is mounted.  The shoe digs into its

flank.  The sound of hoofbeats...

EXT.  STREETS OF ISABEL - DAY

FIVE MEN on HORSEBACK, dressed in fashionable clothes,

canter down what used to be the main street of Isabel.

Through some has been rebuilt, the effects of the

hurricane are still visible...

People look at them curiously.  We see them stop near the

Governor's mansion.  The MEN dismount and walk into the

Palace.

INT.  GOVERNOR'S MANSION - DAY

One of the MEN in black clothes removes his hat and steps

forward.  We recognize him as ALONSO DE BOBADILLA, the man

COLUMBUS humiliated at the rotunda.

COLUMBUS is sitting at his desk, studying plans with

GIACOMO.  Some other MEMBERS of the COUNCIL are with them.

BOBADILLA turns, gestures to one of the other MEN, who

comes forward and gives him a roll of parchment, bearing

the royal seal.

BOBADILLA smiles wickedly, happy to give COLUMBUS a low

blow.

COLUMBUS pales.  Then...

INT.  CELL - SEVILLE PRISON - DAY

All is dark.  We can just make out COLUMBUS' face as he

lies on the hard bed.  He is sweating heavily; his beard

is filthy and matted, like his hair.  He looks feverish.

A key turns in the lock.

The JAILER lets in two fashionably dressed YOUNG MEN.

COLUMBUS, blinking in the light, turns his head to stare

at them.  His eyes are reddened with infection at the

corners.  The YOUNG MEN come forward into the light.

Unable to believe it, COLUMBUS slowly sits up.

He laughs, overcome with joy.  Embraces DIEGO.

DIEGO and FERNANDO look at one another, then back at

COLUMBUS, incredulously, seeing his filthy clothes, his

eyes rimmed with dried mucus.

There's a new excitement in COLUMBUS' voice.  He walks

over to the table.  The candlelight illuminates maps,

charts, drawings, figures...

COLUMBUS laughs and DIEGO looks at them both in

astonishment.

FERNANDO glances at DIEGO.

DIEGO is hurt.

A pause.

DIEGO seems saddened by his brother's attitude.  Once

again DIEGO feels like the outsider.

COLUMBUS hugs him.

INT.  ALHAMBRA - AUDIENCE ROOM - DAY

Like Lucifer and Gabriel, SANTANGEL and SANCHEZ sit on

either side of ISABEL.

ISABEL looks at him, then at SANCHEZ, MOVED BUT CLEARLY

UNDECIDED.  SANTANGEL presses his point.

She starts to laugh.

SANTANGEL tries to stop himself laughing.

INT.  AUDIENCE ROOM - ALHAMBRA PALACE - DAY

COLUMBUS is shown into the room.  ISABEL is waiting for

him.

He drops to his knees before her.  This time she walks

towards him, clearly moved by his white-hair, and other

signs of physical deterioration.

Her hand hovers over his head, as if it means to console

him.  Her hand is dying to comfort.  But instead, she

offers her hand for him to kiss.

COLUMBUS gets slowly to his feet -- but his eyes, as they

meet hers, are as clear as before.  ISABEL smiles with

relief to see it.  He looks back at her.

She smiles -- then again, tries to restrain it, and keeps

her dignity.

COLUMBUS starts to interrupt; she stops him with a

gesture.

She almost bursts out laughing -- only pauses, turns

slightly, then goes out.

INT.  ALHAMBRA PALACE - ROOM NEXT TO THRONE ROOM - DAY

SANCHEZ is standing alone in the next room; he has

obviously been listening.  He looks at her.

INT.  ALHAMBRA PALACE - CORRIDOR - DAY

SANCHEZ, in another direction, along a corridor, towards

his office.  As he reaches a corner with a wide window, a

hand seizes him.  COLUMBUS.

SANCHEZ looks at him -- and doesn't call.  COLUMBUS lets

go of him.

Surprised, SANCHEZ nevertheless turns, looks out.

SANCHEZ turns round again to face him.

COLUMBUS turns abruptly and walks away, vanishing down the

echoing corridor.

EXT.  COLUMBUS' MANOR HOUSE - DAY

COLUMBUS dismounts in the courtyard.  Everything seems

deserted.  There's no one about, no sign of life...

INT.  MANOR HOUSE - DAY

COLUMBUS walks slowly through the great rooms.  There is

nothing left:  no furniture, rugs, pictures... nothing.

He turns, sees BEATRIX standing in a doorway, looking back

at him.  They are both moved.

She smiles.  They don't dare to touch.  BEATRIX looks

round the empty room.

They laugh.  There's a pause.

And they throw themselves into each other's arms.

INT.  DINING ROOM - MANOR HOUSE - EVENING

All that has been left is a simple table and one chair.

They are having supper by candlelight in the vast, empty

room, though the candles throw a warm, sensuous glow on

the figs and hams and wine... and on their faces, as

BEATRIX sits on his lap.

They laugh.  With only a little embarrassment, BEATRIX

gets off COLUMBUS' knee.  SANTANGEL comes forward, and

COLUMBUS embraces him like an old friend.  BEATRIX goes to

the kitchen.

COLUMBUS smiles.  BEATRIX returns with a plate and glass

for SANTANGEL.

He takes the wine BEATRIX offers, and raises his glass.

They all laugh, and drink.

EXT.  SHIP'S DECK - FERNANDO'S POV - NIGHT

Night on the open sea -- the moon shines on the waves and

we hear the creaking of ropes and timbers -- the

loneliness and mystery of the night passage.

COLUMBUS walks over to FERNANDO, who is leaning against

the rail.  He is smoking a cigar... as the smoke blows

over FERNANDO'S face, FERNANDO wretches... It's clear he's

feeling seasick, trying to control it.

COLUMBUS leans against the rail next to him, staring out

at the darkness.  Then looks at his SON again.  FERNANDO

won't give in to the sickness, but COLUMBUS knows he'd

feel better if he did.

COLUMBUS nods meditatively, puffs out some smoke.

FERNANDO winces, gags slightly.

FERNANDO shakes his head.

At the thought of the pork fat, FERNANDO jerks his head

over the side, and vomits copiously.  COLUMBUS smiles,

pats him on the back.

EXT.  SHIP'S DECK - DAY

As it plows through heavy seas.  COLUMBUS, a coat wrapped

around him, is sitting on a chair topside, directing

operations despite an obvious fever.

Suddenly a cry from the mast head:

SAILORS and FERNANDO rush to the side of the ship, peering

through the spray.  FERNANDO wipes his eyes, and then he

sees it:  there in the distance, a speck of land.

FERNANDO and his FATHER stand together, watching the low

cloud formation sitting on the horizon.

FERNANDO looks excited.  Discreetly, COLUMBUS watches his

SON, enjoying his happiness.

EXT.  PANAMA (SURREAL IMAGES) - DAY

A most wonderful and surreal image.  A heavy mist lies

over the forest.  We move above it slowly.

A FIGURE emerges from the mist.  At first only a

silhouette -- then, slowly, a golden figure... an INDIAN,

covered in gold... gold artifacts, golden paste on his

body.

The GOLDEN FIGURE turns, and points, into an unknown

distance.

EXT.  TREEHOUSE - DAY

From the INDIAN treehouse, COLUMBUS, FERNANDO, MENDEZ and

several INDIANS are gazing west over a necklace of

magnificent lakes.

The INDIANS point and talk gently.  FERNANDO has never

seen anything so fresh, so beautiful.

EXT.  CAMP - SUNSET

A magnificent sunset.  A fire is burning, food cooking.

COLUMBUS looks over his maps, trying to figure out where

they are.  We see the outline of the continent of Asia.

An OLD INDIAN squats beside him, silent, also looking at

the map.  Then, slowly and very deliberately, he takes a

piece of charcoal from the fire and begins to draw on the

map.  Ignoring the Asian continent, he sketches the

Panamanian coastline -- an isthmus.  MENDEZ and FERNANDO

gather round.  COLUMBUS watches the OLD INDIAN with

initial puzzlement, then growing excitement.

FERNANDO is still confused.  The OLD INDIAN continues to

sketch, talking quietly all the time.  An INDIAN

TRANSLATOR listens.

The TRANSLATOR asks.  The OLD INDIAN shakes his head,

laughs, points to the west, way beyond the other lakes,

emphatically.

COLUMBUS is too stunned for a moment to explain.  The

INDIANS laugh.

Then COLUMBUS takes the charcoal, and begins to draw on

the map, for his son.

FERNANDO stares west, then back at his FATHER.  COLUMBUS

looks very feverish, his face bathed with sweat.

INT.  SHIP - COLUMBUS' CABIN - NIGHT

COLUMBUS, feverish, lies on the bunk.  He shivers

violently.  FERNANDO anxiously watches over him, bathes

his eyes.

Suddenly THE TRANSLATOR enters.

A little reluctantly, FERNANDO lets him go to his FATHER.

The INDIAN crouches over the bed, takes out a handful of

leaves from a pouch.  He chews the leaves himself for a

moment, until they form a sticky pulp, then opens

COLUMBUS' mouth and puts the pulp inside, encouraging

COLUMBUS to chew with the motions of his hands.

COLUMBUS chews, quickly falling asleep.

EXT.  MOONLIT VISION OF VAST LAND MASS - NIGHT

We see things from COLUMBUS' hallucination.  We are

plunging through layers of clouds, the speed accelerating,

giving us a sickening sensation of falling to land, closer

and closer...

COLUMBUS wakes up with a jolt.  Everything is silent.

COLUMBUS walks outside.

EXT.  DECK - NIGHT

COLUMBUS' fever has subsided.  He raises his head and

stares at the mainland passing in the night.  He smiles.

EXT.  JUNGLE AND BAY - HIGH WIDE SHOT - DAY

The roof of the jungle, the bay beyond, the caravel at

anchor.

EXT.  RIVER - DAY

Two canoes going upstream, deeper and deeper into the

jungle.

EXT.  JUNGLE AND VILLAGE - DAY

Smoke rises lazily above the trees.

The boats reaching the bank.  THE FIRST HUTS of a village.

THE SOLDIERS spread out into the empty village.

FERNANDO, COLUMBUS and MENDEZ preceded by TWO ARMED

SOLDIERS enter one of the huts.  The remains of a meal is

still warm in bowls on the matted floor.

A famished SOLDIER dips his hand in one of the bowls and

devours its contents:  some kind of stew.  Stepping back

accidentally, FERNANDO bumps into a large earthen jar

behind him.  It rolls and crashes, revealing the remains

of meat marinating in liquid.  There is something

disturbing about the appearance of the content.

The remains of human beings.

He stares at the remains, stunned.  THE SOLDIER stops

chewing.  He drops the half-empty bowl he was still

holding.  He runs at the back door, rams his fingers deep

in the back of his throat, and vomits.

But as he vomits and cries, he notices:

A HEADLESS HUMAN TRUNK spread open, like a sheep carcass.

Disturbed flies rise in clouds.

COLUMBUS and the SPANIARDS meet in the center of the

village.  All have made the same horrific discovery.

THE SPANIARDS back out of the village, crossbows pointed

at the invisible enemy hidden in the jungle.

They are running through the dense forest for the river

bank.

The CANNIBALS materialize among the trees, running

alongside.  Bounding, skipping, frightening FIGURES, their

brutal faces painted in black.  They release arrows at the

running SOLDIERS.  A SOLDIER stops, kneels to the ground,

fires his crossbow and kills one of the CANNIBALS... but

he is pierced by a spear.  TWO CANNIBALS drag him and cut

his throat to finish him.

ELSEWHERE IN THE JUNGLE -- CRIES AND CONFUSION, SPANIARDS

and CANNIBALS moving in hand to hand combat.

A CANNIBAL comes sprinting at FERNANDO, brandishing his

lance.

COLUMBUS jumps on the man, and plants a knife in his

abdomen.  Blinded in sweat, he stabs the CANNIBAL, who

collapses.  Frenzied, COLUMBUS stabs over and over again.

He stops and looks at his forearm -- soaked in blood.

Shocked by his own fury, he raises his hand and stares at

it.

A GIANT BLACK BUTTERFLY alights gently on his bloody

fingers, COLUMBUS staring fascinated at its palpitating

wings.  FERNANDO, screaming at his FATHER, drags him to

his feet.  They run...

THE SPANIARDS, COLUMBUS, MENDEZ, FERNANDO... all running

hard to the boat.  ARROWS whistle around them as they leap

into the canoes, nearly capsizing them, launching them

into the current.

SOME CANNIBALS still follow them along the riverbank.  But

the canoes are faster, and soon, they are left behind.

EXT.  SHIP AT SEA - DAY

Endless seascape, the caravel plowing.

EXT.  SHIP'S DECK - DAY

FERNANDO is crouched on the poop deck, wrapped in a

blanket.  He seems in a state of shock:  he is pale and

shaking.  As COLUMBUS goes and sits near his son, he hands

him a flask of alcohol.

As COLUMBUS insists, brandishing the flask, FERNANDO

notices that his hands are shaking too.  His FATHER'S

forehead is dripping with sweat.

FERNANDO drinks a gulp and grimaces.  He drinks again and

hands the flask back to his FATHER, who does the same.

FERNANDO notices dried blood on his FATHER'S fingers.

COLUMBUS immediately hides his hand and stands.

Then, with sudden anger.

He walks a few steps, lurches, and has to lean against the

rail.  He raises his hand to his eyes, grimacing in pain,

as if they were burning.  FERNANDO scrambles to his feet

and rushes to him.  COLUMBUS' eyes are already fixed

somewhere -- fever is eating him up.

FERNANDO turns around for help.

INT.  SHIP'S CABIN - DAY

COLUMBUS is lying on his couch.  FERNANDO is bathing his

eyes, sweeping off the pus that continuously forms in

them.  COLUMBUS is drenched in sweat.

FERNANDO is writing under his FATHER'S dictation.

INT.  ALCAZAR PALACE - GARDENS - DAY

The DUENA, sitting beside ISABEL, quietly continues to

read COLUMBUS' letter aloud.

She stops reading.  ISABEL turns her face away.

INT.  UNIVERSITY OF SALAMANCA - DAY

An ivory-sculptured hand -- the end of the back scratcher

belonging to AROJAZ -- indicates a line across a large

globe:  the route between Europe and America.

We see a large amphitheater, filled with PEOPLE attending

a lecture of "Nova Geographica" -- the new geography.

AROJAZ stands in front of the assembly.  Facing him,

enthroned, is KING FERDINAND, surrounded by COURTIERS,

including SANCHEZ.

We slowly move across the arena, passing attentive faces.

We continue to rise up the tiers of seats...

On a highest tier, we stop on the face of CHRISTOPHER

COLUMBUS, listening impassively.

CLOSE ON COLUMBUS' eyes.

On COLUMBUS.

EXT.  UNIVERSITY OF SALAMANCA - DAY

Around the KING, on horseback, surrounded by the KNIGHTS,

a CROWD is kept back by SOLDIERS.  AROJAZ is mounting his

horse.  SANCHEZ is waiting for him.

COLUMBUS stands among the students at the back of the

CROWD.

AROJAZ rides next to SANCHEZ.  AROJAZ suddenly spots

COLUMBUS in the crowd, as they move off.

They pass close enough to touch COLUMBUS.  But he does not

see them.

AROJAZ looks at SANCHEZ in surprise -- then cranes his

neck round, and looks back at COLUMBUS -- now a FACE IN

THE CROWD.

EXT.  LA RABIDA MONASTERY - KITCHEN GARDEN - DAY

ANTONIO DE MARCHENA, a very old man now, is taking a

siesta next to his grapes.  He is sitting in a simple

armchair, a rosary wrapped around his fingers.

The presence of someone wakes him.  After a moment, he

recognizes COLUMBUS and smiles.  Both MEN are very moved.

They laugh.  COLUMBUS sits down.  Bees drone lazily in the

sunlight.

MARCHENA nods his head.

MARCHENA looks at his plants, sighs contentedly.

COLUMBUS nods.

He pauses, looks across at COLUMBUS, smiles again gently.

MARCHENA, tiring, leans back in his chair, and looks up

towards the sun.

MARCHENA starts laughing.

They both laugh.

EXT.  BEATRIX'S HOUSE BALCONY - EVENING

FERNANDO is sitting in front of his FATHER, examining

documents and letters.  COLUMBUS has wrapped a shawl

around his legs.  He looks even older now, with his mass

of pure white hair.

BEATRIX comes out with a tray, carrying grapes and a

decanter of water.  She places it on a small table near

COLUMBUS and touches his shoulder.

As she is ready to return inside the house, he holds her

back.

He smiles.  She looks at him smiling, intrigued.

FERNANDO looks up at them above his letters, amused and

slightly embarrassed.  COLUMBUS looks at him with a fake

air of reproach.

FERNANDO opens a letter and reads it quickly.

COLUMBUS smiles and nods -- all this seems to be of very

little importance to him now.

FERNANDO continues to read.

He opens one of them, glances at it.

COLUMBUS' eyes brighten with joy.

FERNANDO laughs -- then, suddenly serious.

COLUMBUS sighs, and leans back on his chair.  His eyes are

fixed somewhere, searching.  Then, almost in a murmur.

We see the page.  FERNANDO writes: ... I REMEMBER...

A drop of ink falls from the quill onto the page and the

words.

FERNANDO is waiting.

COLUMBUS' eyes.

EXT.  BEACH AND JUNGLE - FIRST LANDING - DAY

A MOVING IMAGE, as seen from the rolling deck of a ship.

We see:

A majestic forest, resting on a slash of white sand, and

deep blue sea...

THE LONE SILHOUETTE of an INDIAN emerges from the dense

foliage.  He runs down the beach towards the surf.  He

stops and seems to be staring at us.

These words appear on the screen:

END AND CREDITS.
