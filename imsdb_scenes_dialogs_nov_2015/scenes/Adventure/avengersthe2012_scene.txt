"And there came a day, a day unlike any other, when Earth's

mightiest heroes and heroines found themselves united against a

common threat. On that day, the Avengers were born--to fight the

foes no single superhero could withstand! Through the years,

their roster has prospered, changing many times, but their glory

has never been denied! Heed the call, then--for now, the Avengers

Assemble!"

BURNING BLUE FLAMES. A smoky cube shape emerges - THE TESSERACT.

Filling the screen with BLACKNESS.

EXT. THRONE ROOM, SPACE  NIGHT

Kneeling behind a THRONE, a CLOTHED, ARMORED FIGURE known as THE

OTHER, bows.

THE OTHER faces a HORNED SHAPED SHADOW. LOKI. Loki is handed the

CHITAURI SCEPTER, a long golden handle, fitted with a blue gem

encircled with silver blades.

HIGH WIDE ON: TENS OF THOUSANDS of CHITAURI stand ready in a

seething mass of neat rows and columns....the ground simply

QUAKES.

EXT. S.H.I.E.L.D. PROJECT P.E.G.A.S.U.S FACILITY  NIGHT

Out in the NEW MEXICO desert, a remote research facility is in a

state of panic. It's an evacuation. A SWOOPING helicopter flies

in.

CHAOS. Men in suits run around like in the typical `we have to

leave' fashion. Soldiers on foot jump onto Humvees, accelerating

the hell out of there. A VOICE bellows from hidden loudspeakers.

EXT. HELICOPTER PAD  CONTINUOUS

Standing a few yards from the landing pad, A Fed in a suit with

badass shades, peers at the helicopter as it lands. This is

SHIELD AGENT PHIL COULSON.

Walking out of the helicopter is SHIELD AGENT MARIA HILL, SEXY,

FIERCE AND DETERMINED. Following her, SHIELD DIRECTOR NICK FURY

climbs out. Hill and Fury approach Agent Coulson.

INT. FACILITY FLOOR  NIGHT

Agent Coulson leads Hill and Fury through the radiation section

of the facility. Hundreds of technicians and other staff run

around, taking only the essentials.

CONTINUOUSLY HEADING DOWN TO RADIATION FACILITY FLOOR

INT. NASA SPACE RADIATION FACILITY, VACUUM CHAMBER  CONTINUOUS

Fury enters the lab facility where the Tesseract is being held

by a COMPACT MUON SOLENOID COIL CHAMBER.

DR. ERIK SELVIG emerges from behind the CMS machine, concerned.

The Tesseract is glowing unusually brighter and flare rings

shoot out at random.

We see CLINT BARTON, dressed in black tactical gear, is up on

the railings watching them below, Fury calls Barton on his

earpiece.

BARTON rappels down from the catwalk. Walks up to Fury. They

both walk around the facility in a discreet manner.

DR. SELVIG clacks away at the keyboard and sees on the

monitoring his worst nightmares. Suddenly- the Tesseract

THUNDERS and SHAKES the entire facility. Big enough where both

Agents Hill and Coulson can feel and they're at different ends

of the facility.

The flaring rings and glow of the cube spout out brighter and

louder, like a boiling pot of water. The Tesseract's energy

builds up into a BEAM much like the Bifrost Bridge, which HITS

at the end of a platform that is wired to the CMS device. The

great maelstrom beam FIRES the TESSERACT energy. The beam then

forms a VORTEX, which then opens up a PORTAL.

A BLACK HOLE IS CREATED. From the portal, the blackness of

SPACE, beautiful and mysterious, strewn with a billion stars

appears and a GUST of BLUE ENERGY CLOUDS fill the room, blinding

everyone.

The Tesseract's energy forms into a cloud that reaches to the

top the facility's vacuum chamber ceiling. It's abnormally

quiet. Then... HEAVY BREATHING is heard from the platform.

SHIELD GUARDS slowly approach, weapons in hands. A figure is

kneeling on the platform, smoke coming off it. It's LOKI.

Smiling in his mischievous manner, he raises his head. The smile

dies down. He looks deep into the eyes of Fury, Barton and

Selvig. He stands up, holing the scepter.

Loki looks at his spear then suddenly points it at where Fury

and Barton are standing and SHOOTS OUT A BLUE EXPLODING LIGHT

TOWARDS THEM. BARTON TACKLES Fury and they both barely miss

Loki's fired shot.

ALL HELL BREAKS. Machine gun fire is shot at Loki, but the

bullets bounce off him like a boss. Loki jumps high from the

platform and ATTACKS those firing at him.

In the blink of an eye, Loki takes down several guards with his

KNIVES and ENERGY BLASTS from the scepter. He stops and waits to

see who will attack him next. Honestly, the whole lab has almost

gone to shit.

Barton tries to stand up. Loki quickly walks towards him. Barton

raises his gun, but Loki grabs Barton's hand.

Loki points the head of his spear at Barton's head. Barton's

eyes suddenly glow BLACK. The ability to control Barton's mind

is now in Loki's hand. Barton puts his piece away and stands

straight.

As Loki is busy using his abilities to control the minds of

several S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel, Fury takes the Tesseract,

placing it back into its case and tries to leave the lab.Then...

Like a gunslinger, Loki turns to face Selvig who's

standingbehind him and places his spear against Selvig's heart.

Selvig's eyes glow BLACK.

From the vacuum chamber ceiling, Tesseract's energy cloud

RAPIDLY builds into what may be an implosion.

Loki, looking at Barton, who doesn't even hesitate, SHOOTS FURY

WHO FALLS TO THE GROUND. Barton grabs the case containing the

Tesseract and leaves the lab with Loki, Selvig and the other

S.H.I.E.L.D personnel Loki is controlling.

INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S BUNKER, ENTRANCE OF EXITING TUNNEL  NIGHT

Loki, Barton, Selvig and the other S.H.I.E.L.D personnel are in

the parking lot of the facility, quickly gathering certain

weapons. Agent Hill watches in confusion, referring to Loki.

Agent Hill looks suspiciously at them as they get into the truck

and turns to leave, as she's walking away...

Loki and Barton SHARPLY look at Agent Hill.

BACK AT THE LAB

Fury is sitting up, pulling out the bullet, breathing heavily.

INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S BUNKER  NIGHT

Suddenly, Hill turns to SHOOT AT BARTON, but Barton is already

POINTING HIS GUN at her and starts SHOOTING, he moves the

driver's seat of the truck and DRIVES OFF as Hill keeps

shooting.

BACK AT THE LAB

Fury is holding his side, running.

The energy is really brewing a fucking shit storm from the

vacuum chamber ceiling.

INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S BUNKER/TUNNEL  NIGHT

Agent Hill SLIPS into a JEEP and follows after Barton's

truck.Loki's trucks SCREECH across the tunnel. Several SHIELD

trucks pull up to them. A drive-by shooting ensues.

Loki, who stands on top of the bed of the truck, uses his

scepter and EMITS energy blasts, flipping over SHIELD trucks.

They get in, the cars roar out after them. Agent Hill puts

herself at a distance.

INT. FACILITY FLOOR  NIGHT

Fury races out of the hallway, avoiding falling pipes. The

entire facility is now in a full earthquake.

INT. FACILITY FLOOR, ELSEWHERE  CONTINUOUS

Agent Coulson and several SHIELD agents fall down the steps,

dropping SILVER CASES of information. They attempt to grab them,

but...

They run out of there like a bat from hell.

INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S TUNNEL  NIGHT

Agent Hill's JEEP ROARS out of a side of Barton's truck and

pulls up alongside them on the left. She goes way ahead and

pulls her brake, swerving into a 360, facing Barton's truck and

driving in reverse.

Barton's ARMS reach out the open window and OPENS FIRE. Agent

Hill figures `fuck it' and SHOOTS her windshield OPENING FIRE on

Barton.

EXT. VAN  NIGHT

Agent Coulson jumps into a SHIELD VAN. On his walkie:

EXT. HELICOPTER PAD  CONTINUOUS

Fury BOLTS out of the facility and jumps into a helicopter. The

surface of the pad gives way, PLUNGING the helicopter through

the surface. But Fury's chopper BARELY makes it out.

INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S TUNNEL  NIGHT

Still in a chase and drive-by sequence, Barton's pushes the

pedal harder, which causes Agent Hill's JEEP to WOBBLE out and

put her back behind.

INT. RADIATION FACILITY, VACUUM CHAMBER  NIGHT

The Tesseract's energy cloud now SHRINKS into a SMALL BALL OF

WHITE LIGHT. Then...

A CLOUD OF BLUE LIGHT CONSUMES THE ENTIRE FACILITY AND PARTS OF

THE DESERT. Fury watches from below, a RAPID build-up into what

may be an implosion. Several miles away, Agent Coulson's van

feels a JOLT of the Tesseract's BLASTWAVE. THE ENTIRE FACILITY

SWALLOWS INTO ITSELF-- A TERRIFYING, UNIMAGINABLE IMPLOSION.

INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S TUNNEL  NIGHT

The BLASTWAVE of the Tesseract causes the tunnel to cave it.

Like an ocean wave, blinding crumbles of falling rock, fall onto

Agent Hill's JEEP, leaving her NEARLY trapped under this blanket

of rock.

On the Barton's truck, they escape the tunnel and drive into the

desert landscape. Fury's helicopter ROARS over Barton's truck.

Loki looks up.

From the chopper's door, it slides open and Fury stands there,

holding a gun, SHOOTING at Barton's, giving an honoring image of

JULES WINNFIELD.

Loki looks at Fury and in a fit of RAGE, points his scepter

SHOOTS OUT THE BLUE LIGHT. The chopper CATCHES on fire, GOING

DOWN in a FIERY BALL. Fury, like the boss he is, JUMPS OUT and

touches down onto the desert floor. The chopper BARRELS along

the ground.

Fury, coming back to his senses, FIRES at Loki, but they're

toofar and too late. Loki looks back, smiling. Fury stands

there, MIND REELING. Then...

INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S TUNNEL  NIGHT

Agent Hill climbs out her JEEP, which is sandwiched in, but

luckily, not her.

EXT. DESERT  NIGHT

A beat.

Fury stands there. Thinking. He looks up. On his face is sign of

hope.

EXT. RUSSIA, SOLENSKI PLAZA, 3RD FLOOR  NIGHT

Out in the outskirts, near a railroad, a still in construction

building is being occupied by GEORGI LUCHKOV, a LARGE, RUSSIAN

GENERAL along with his THUGS.

TALL THUG is in the middle of a brutal beating on NATASHA

ROMANOFF, a SLEWING, FOXY, UNBELIEVABLY SEXY SPY. He BACKHANDS

NATASHA'S face. She feels the pain, but does not breakdown.

LUCHKOV, smiling, walks up to her. Dialogue is in RUSSIAN.

TALL THUG rocks her chair back, balancing her off the edge of an

open floor. Natasha is now scared.

LUCHKOV slowly walks over to a table filled with tools. He picks

up a pair of pliers. TALL THUG opens up her mouth wide open.

Suddenly, WEASELLY THUG'S cell rings. Confused, he answers.

LUCHKOV takes the phone, pissed.

HOLY SHIT. LUCHKOV places the cell phone against Natasha's ear

seeing how she's tied to a chair with her hands tied behind her

back.

Natasha gives him a look.

A beat.

She nods to LUCHKOV. As Luchkov comes to take the phone off her,

Natasha HITS him with her leg and HEADBUUTS him. Like a spider,

she stands up elegantly and starts ATTACKING TALL THUG by

KICKBOXING him in the face.

Still tied, she ROLLS over WEASELLY THUG after she trips him.

She then STOMPS on TALL THUG foot with peg of the chair, then

KNOCKS HIM OUT WITH HER HEAD.

Yeah, during all this Coulson is still waiting on the line. She

then FLIPS over and FALLS down hard on WEASELLY THUG, BREAKING

THE CHAIR. She sees TALL THUG stand.

Giving her momentum, she runs at him DROP KICKING him, FALLS

DOWN and FLIPS right back up and WRAPS HER LEGS AROUND HIS NECK

AND KNOCKS HIM OUT COLD.

She grabs LUCHKOV, wraps his leg around with a hanging chain and

drops him down the open floor, dangling. She picks up the phone

and her heels, like a boss.

EXT. INDIAN SLUM  NIGHT

A LITTLE GIRL runs through the crowd, trying to force a way

through.

INT. SHACK  NIGHT

A tiny shack. The LITTLE GIRL runs up the steps, only to be

stopped by an attending woman. Then, the LITTLE GIRL spots him.

BRUCE BANNER, their LOCAL doctor.

Banner looks behind him seeing how the girl is staring at a few

people, lying down, looking very sick.

The LITTLE GIRL holds out all the money she has in the world.

EXT. SLUMS  CONTINUOUS

Banner and the LITTLE GIRL hastily run nearly to the edge of

town. The LITTLE GIRL gets ahead of herself. Banner spots local

government car, he turns around, blocking any view of him.

EXT/INT. LITTLE GIRL'S SHACK  NIGHT

Banner quickly follows the LITTLE GIRL inside her house. As he

walks in, the LITTLE GIRL ESCAPES THROUGH THE WINDOW. Banner is

left standing there like a dumbass.

Natasha then appears from behind the curtains. Banner turns

around, quietly.

She shows him a photo of the Tesseract on her cell phone. Banner

takes a closer look.

The THUNDEROUS TONE in is voice makes Natasha QUICKLY grab her

gun and point it at him, but something is now OFF in the

atmosphere. Banner stands straight up, smiling.

Natasha, still wary, doesn't lower her gun. She lowers her gun

and speaks into her earpiece.

EXT. OUTSIDE THE LITTLE GIRL'S SHACK  NIGHT

Amazingly, DOZENS OF SHIELD AGENTS are surrounding the shack

outside.

INT. LITTLE GIRL'S SHACK  NIGHT

INT. BROOKLYN GYM  NIGHT

Somewhere in an old, almost WWII-esque boxing gym, STEVE ROGERS,

PUMMELING a punching bag. With every swing, it's like a memory

he's trying to fight off and repress.

EXT. HYDRA BASE  DAY (FLASHBACK)

A half frozen Steve Roger is lying down on a medical slab. Two

SHIELD SCIENTISTS run over hi-tech devices to see if his vitals

are up. And it seems...

INT. BROOKLYN GYM  NIGHT

Steve FUCKING tears the bag open, off its chain, spilling out

the sand. He stands, breathing hard, letting out 70 years of

over repressed feeling.

After taking a few breathers, Steve picks up another punching

bag, which is laying next another DOZEN BAGS. He hooks the bag

up and starts punching again. Fury walks in.

Steve stops punching and walks over to the bench, unraveling the

tape off his hands. He sits down.

Fury hands Steve a file on the Tesseract, along with other files

on HYDRA'S projects.

Steve turns and picks up a punching bag. Starts walking out of

the gym.

INT. OCEAN  NIGHT

Out in the Atlantic Ocean, TONY STARK, in his IRON MAN suit, is

cutting a PIPELINE TRANSPORT with a laser cutter coming from his

hand. He then places a STARK ENERGY REACTOR. It lights up. IRON

MAN rockets out of the water and flies towards STARK TOWER.

INSIDE THE SUIT -- PEPPER APPEARS ON HIS HUD MONITOR.

As IRON MAN flies to the STARK TOWER BUILDING, the power is

switched on and the STARK sign LIGHTS UP.

TONY arrives at his skyscraper penthouse and is in the process

of taking off his IRON MAN suit through a hi-tech gauntlet of

gadgets.

INT. TONY'S PENTHOUSE  NIGHT

PEPPER POTTS stares up at the monitors of the reactor device.

Points to the energy in his chest plate.

Pepper pours herself and Tony a glass of champagne.

At that moment the elevator door opens and Coulson appears.

She passes her glass of champagne to Coulson and takes the file

from him, then takes her champagne glass back from Coulson and

passes the file over to Stark.

Pepper walks over to Tony who places the files into his own

databases.

Tony EXPANDS his arms and different profiles appear in

holographic form floating in the air in front of Tony and

Pepper.

Screens appear of CAPTAIN AMERICA IN ACTION, the HULK ROARING AS

HE ATTACKS THE ARMY AT CULVER UNIVERSITY, THOR FIGHTING THE

DESTROYER and another is of Loki and the Tesseract, to which

holograph form, worried.

INT. QUINJET  DAY

Inside the QUINJET, Steve is sitting down, holding a TABLET,

watching the footage of the Hulk's attack on the Army at Culver

University.

Agent Coulson stands up from his seat and walks over to Steve.

Steve looks confused.

Steve smiles at Coulson.

Steve looks down. He stands up, closes his laptop and walks to

the side with Coulson following.

Steve takes in Coulson's sentiment.

INT. UNDERGROUND LAB  DAY

Several soldiers under Loki's mind control run around, preparing

to infiltrate whatever Loki has planned. Loki sits down,

watching Selvig work with a CMS device. Loki meditates, until...

EXT. THRONE ROOM  NIGHT

...the scepter materializes him back into the throne room of THE

OTHER, fully armed in his horned helmet and armor. THE OTHER

appears from the steps.

THE OTHER runs over to attack him, but stops as Loki points his

THE OTHER places his hand on Loki's head and transports him back

to Earth. Loki looks around, menacing.

EXT. HELICARRIER LANDING STRIP  DAY

The QUINJET lands down a MASSIVE BATTLESHIP known as the

HELICARRIER. It has two runways. One with direct access to a

hangar at the rear is aligned along the spine of the vessel.

Agent Coulson and Steve walk down the ramp, meeting up with

Natasha.

Agent Coulson walks away leaving Steve with Natasha, walking

towards the railing of the ship.

Without realizing, Banner doesn't notice them walking as he

isnervous as hell. He moves around as people keep walking in

hisway.

Steve walks up to Banner and shakes his hands.

Suddenly the HELICARRIER starts SHAKING as it prepares to fly

"sail."

They both move closer to the edge of the HELICARRIER. FOUR HUGE

LIFT FANS MOUNTED ON THE SIDES STARTS TO LIFT INTO THE AIR IN

VTOL FLIGHT. Steve watches in AWE as Banner smiles.

INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE  DAY

The doors part and we enter THE BRIDGE OF THE SHIP  a flurry of

activity  dozens of agents sit in front of their VIEWSCREENS.

Agent Hill shouts her instructs to leave. Turns to NICK FURY,

camouflages in the sky.

INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE  CONTINUOUS

Steve and Banner walk through the glorious, gleaming bridge,

taking his position at the SCIENCE CONSOLE.

Steve gives Fury 10 bucks, referring to his earlier statement

about never being surprised again. Fury walks over Banner and

Inside, a lavished gala with an orchestra playing, is

interrupted as the HEAD DOCTOR walks up to the mic.

INT. HELICARRIER, STEVE'S LOCKER  NIGHT

Steve walks into his own locker room. As he approaches to the

steel cabinet, the doors already reveal the updated CAPTAIN

AMERICA UNIFORM, along with the famous SHIELD. He stands in

silence.

EXT. STUTTGART MUSEUM  NIGHT

Outside the museum, GERMAN GUARDS stand in their positions. One

of them is standing on top of the roof, scoping. He then hears a

THWACK!

He looks down. One of his guards is shot with an ARROW. He

raises his gun. He is shot dead by an arrow. Falls down. Barton

and his CREW arrive at the doors of the locked science building.

Barton looks at the retinal scanner. He pulls out a SHIELD eye

scanner instrument.

INT. STUTTGART GALA  NIGHT

Loki looks from above the museum and descends down to where the

HEAD DOCTOR is. As he makes it down and near the stage, he FLIPS

his cane the other end. The guard there notices him, pulls out

his gun, but Loki CLUBS his head in. CHAOS ERUPTS.

Guests begin to leave the museum. Loki grabs the doctor and

flips him over onto a marble table of the mythological creatures

BILCHSTEIM. Loki pulls out an OPTICAL TORTURE DEVICE. He PLUNGES

down the doctor's eye. The doctor TWISTS in pain.

EXT. STUTTGART MUSEUM  NIGHT

Suddenly, from Barton's instrument, a holographic eye of the

head doctor appears and the image of the doctor appears on

screen.

The doors to the facility open. Barton walks in and finds in a

cabinet, a glass thermos with a cylinder of iridium.

EXT. STUTTGART GALA  NIGHT

As the crowd runs away, Loki slowly walks out and materializes

in his gold armor and helmet. The POLICE arrive and with no

hesitation, he BLASTS the cars, FLIPPING them over and over.

The crowd ignores him. Another LOKI appears, blocking the crowd.

Loki after Loki appears, they all grin as they raise their

spears, encircling the crowd.

Everyone becomes quiet and kneels in front him. Loki embracing

his arms out, smiling.

As the words resonate to the kneeling crowd, an ELDER GERMAN MAN

refuses to kneel and stands, heroic.

Loki is about to execute him with his scepter as the light GLOWS

blue. Just as the ENERGY BEAM shoots out, FUCKING CAPTAIN

AMERICA arrives! He dives in just in time and BLOCKS the blast

with his SHIELD, knocking down Loki on his ass.

From above Cap, the QUINJET arrives. A machine gun is pointed

towards Loki.

Like greased lighting, Loki sends a BLAST of blue at the

QUINJET. Natasha MANEUVERS it just in time, giving Cap the time

to throw his shield at Loki. They both begin to DUKE IT OUT.

Loki FLINGS Cap to the ground. Cap then throws his shield, but

Loki SWATS it way. Cap, using all the moves of a boxer, is

KNOCKED down by Loki. Standing over him, he points the scepter's

tip on his helmet.

Cap FLIPS and KNOCKS him out with his leg. Loki grabs him and

FLIPS him over.

INT. QUINJET  NIGHT

Suddenly, AC/DC's "Shoot to Thrill" overdrives the QUINJET'S

speakers.

Both Cap and Loki look up at the sky. Tony flies over in his

IRON MAN suit and blasts Loki right back to the ground. IRON MAN

touches down. He stands up and pulls out every piece of weaponry

the suit has.

Loki puts up his hands and surrenders. His armor materializes

away.

INT. QUINJET  NIGHT

Natasha watches the skies. THUNDER. Coming out of nowhere. Fury

speaks over her headset.

With Loki tied up and cuffed to his seat, Tony and Steve watch

from a distance, whispering.

Steve looks at Tony, finally meeting his ego match.

THUNDER and LIGHTNING nearly hit the jet, making it shake

violently.

Thunder RUMBLES overhead. Loki stares out the window intently.

What the fuck? OUTSIDE THE JET A BLINDING LIGHT hits the jet.

Not a light. A King.

THE MIGHTY THOR. Thor OPENS the ramp and grabs Loki by the

throat and flies out. Steve and Tony are left dumbstruck. Tony

puts the IRON MAN helmet on.

Tony turns and gets ready to jump off the jet to chase after

Thor.

IRON MAN jumps out of the jet and chases after Thor. Cap grabs a

parachute to follow.

Cap JUMPS OUT of the jet.

EXT. MOUNTAIN LEDGE  NIGHT

Somewhere out in the European mountains, Thor throws Loki into

the side of the mountain. He raises the mighty hammer, MJOLNIR.

He looks down at his brother, who he thought to be dead and is

angry to see him alive in this fashion.

Thor drops MJOLNIR, causing the mountain to quake. He picks up

Loki. His brother.

Although Thor is pissed for what he has done, a family is

everything to a man or god.

Thor lets go Loki, who walks away from Thor, causing an even

bigger wedge between them.

Angrily, Loki shoves his brother to the side. He walks back up

to the ledge. Turns around.

Mjolnir flies back to his grasp.

THOR IS KNOCKED OFF THE MOUNTAIN BY IRON MAN WHO TACKLES HIM IN

MID-FLIGHT.

EXT. FOREST  CONTINUOUS

THOR and IRON MAN CRASH into the forest. Thor rolls himself up.

IRON MAN is still standing, but keeps his distance. The helmet

opens up.

The IRON MAN helmet clamps up and he walks away. In one quick

move, Thor pulls Mjolnir, throws it, and KNOCKS IRON MAN clear

across into a tree.

INSIDE THE SUIT

From the mountain side, Loki watches in amusement. Thor raises

his hand. Mjolnir flies back to his hand. Thor SWINGS the

hammer, summoning a ray of energy.

IRON MAN stands up and from his HAND BOOSTERS, a BLAST of ENERGY

KNOCKS the MIGHTY AVENGER on his ass. IRON MAN flies back up and

knocks Thor into a tree. Right back at you, bitch!

Thor, kneeling on the ground, pulls Mjolnir to his hand, raises

it to the skies and pulls in LIGHTING and THUNDER! Thor points

the hammer at IRON MAN and the outpouring of bolts lighting

increases in intensity. IRON MAN falls back.

INSIDE THE SUIT

IRON MAN FIRES AWAY FROM HIS HAND BOOSTERS, pushing Thor to his

knees. Like two gunslingers ready to draw, both Thor and IRON

MAN fly towards each other and meet in the middle and ascend up.

EXT. SKY  NIGHT

The two battle. IRON MAN grasps THOR, elbowing him and SMASHING

him into the side of a mountain.

THOR LEAPS off the mountain and takes IRON MAN with him.

EXT. FOREST  CONTINUOUS

THOR and IRON MAN crash right back down, smashing down every

tree possible. IRON MAN YANKS Thor right up. Thor grabs both

HANDS BOOSTERS and begins to CRUSH them. Tony quickly CHARGES as

much energy as he can and SHOOTS ENERGY in Thor's face.

Thor FALLS back, losing his stance. IRON MAN HEADBUTTS Thor,

with his gold-titanium alloy helmet. Thor... HEADBUTTS him with

his fuckin' head and actually sends IRON MAN across the forest.

IRON MAN boosters up and flies back at Thor, grabbing him by the

arm and cape and SWINGS him into another tree. Thor looks up,

ready. Thor runs with all his patience out the window. IRON MAN

SWINGS and MISSES, giving Thor the momentum to grab him, lift

him and SMASH him down hard.

Thor summons back Mjolnir to his hand. Just as he's about to put

the hammer down, IRON MAN uses his HAND BOOSTERS to SKID across

the ground and trip Thor over. Standing up, Thor looks for him,

but from behind him, IRON MAN CRASHES into his back. Thor stands

facing IRON MAN. Ready to pounce...

CAPTAIN AMERICA'S shield RICOCHETS off both Thor and IRON MAN,

stopping them. They look up and see CAPTAIN AMERICA standing on

top of a fallen tree with the shield back in hand.

THOR BACKHANDS IRON MAN LIKE A PIMP WITH MJOLNIR.

Thor, losing all tolerance with this SENTENTIAL OF LIBERTY,

raises the hammer.

THOR LEAPS HIGH INTO THE AIR, RAISING THAT FUCKING HAMMER.

CAPTAIN AMERICA CROUCHES DOWN and HOLDS UP HIS SHIELD. THOR

brings that hammer down onto the shield and a MASSIVE IMPLOSION

OF LIGHT reacts to the vibranium shield creating a MASSIVE

SHOCKWAVE THAT BLOWS UP ANYTHING STANDING WITHIN A MILE.

IRON MAN stands up, looking around like `holy shit.' Lying right

next to him is Cap, who never takes his eye off Thor. Thor looks

at both men.

THOR, CAPTAIN AMERICA AND IRON MAN STAND THERE.

INT. HELICARRIER HALLWAY  NIGHT

DOZENS of SHIELD POLICE escort Loki, who is in handcuffs,

smiling. As they pass the HELICARRIER LAB, Banner stops working

on the CHITAURI SCEPTER and looks up. Loki eyes him as he walks,

nodding and smiling. BANNER rubs his head.

INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION  NIGHT

Loki is now free from his cuffs and is contained in a LARGE

GLASS CELL held by HYDRAULIC RIGS. Fury walks up the control

panel of the cell.

Fury presses a button which OPENS UP a HATCH underneath Loki's

cell. Loki peers as much as he can from the glass.

Without seeing, the sounds of GUSTING WIND would make man shit

his pants. Not a god, though.

Fury closes the hatch. Points at Loki.

Then points at the button which would drop Loki into the steel

trap.

Loki looks into the camera.

INT. BRIEFING ROOM  CONTINUOUS

The others watch on the monitor Loki getting interrogated.

Banner looks at the monitor, intently.

INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION  CONTINUOUS

Fury walks off leaving Loki in his glass cell. Loki looks back

at the camera, smirking.

INT. BRIEFING ROOM  CONTINUOUS

Steve watches until the monitor goes black. Thor, who didn't

even look, just listened, stands there, torn apart. They all

just stand there in stunned SILENCE. Finally --

So he's building another portal. That's

what he needs Erik Selvig for.

Selvig?

He's an astrophysicist.

He's a friend.

Loki has him under some kind of spell,

along with one of ours.

I wanna know why Loki let us take him.

He's not leading an army from here.

I don't think we should be focusing on

Loki. That guy's brain is a bag full of

cats, you could smell crazy on him.

Have care how you speak. Loki is beyond

reason, but he is of Asgard, and he's

my brother.

He killed eighty people in two days.

He's adopted.

Iridium, what did they need the Iridium

for?

It's a stabilizing agent.

I'll fly you there. Keep the love

alive. Means the portal won't collapse

on itself, like it did at SHIELD.

Tony looks around the monitors and places a BUTTON SIZE HACKING

IMPLANT under Fury's desk, without anyone noticing.

Tony and Banner shake hands. A glimmer in their eyes shines as

the mutual respect for each other shows.

Tony rolls his eyes, while Cap looks proud of himself.

As Banner and Tony walk out, the GALAGA PLAYER turns ever so

discreetly, watches as everyone else disperses and goes back to

playing.

INT. BANNER'S LAB - NIGHT (LATER)

Banner continuously scans with a gamma ray detection scanner on

the scepter for radiation.

Tony looks at his monitors, shifting and solving as many

algorithms and equations.

Suddenly, Tony pokes Banner with a MINIATURE ELECTRICAL PROD.

Steve walks in on them, pissed at Tony.

Tony looks at Banner closely.

A beat.

It's powered by Stark Reactors, self-

sustaining energy source. That building

will run itself for what, a year?

That's just the prototype. I'm kind of

the only name in clean energy right

now.

So, why didn't SHIELD bring him in on

the Tesseract project? I mean, what are

they doing in the energy business in

the first place?

I should probably look into that once

my decryption programmer finishes

breaking into all of SHIELD's secure

files.

I'm sorry, did you say...?

Jarvis has been running it since I hit

the bridge. In a few hours we'll know

every dirty secret SHIELD has ever

tried to hide.

Blueberry?

Yet you're confused about why they

didn't want you around?

An intelligence organization that fears

intelligence? Historically, not

possible.

Steve takes in the possibility, but as an obedient soldier,

shakes it off.

Steve walks out of the lab. Still torn apart by the possibility,

he walks away, towards the HULL of the ship.

BACK IN THE LAB

Banner tries to read the computer screen, but Tony slides the

data aside with his finger so the two can see face-to-face.

Banner and Stark get back to work at their respective computers.

INT. HULL HANGAR, SECURE STORAGE 10-C  NIGHT

Steve, with all his MIGHT, slides the HEAVY IRON door and

STEALTHILY walks in. SECURE STORAGE 10-C is a large warehouse,

filled with METAL CRATES stacked.

Steve looks up, seeing another level. He LEAPS up high and holds

onto the catwalk railing. Steve continues to move forward.

INT. VAN  NIGHT

Inside this particular van, Selvig and a few other SOLDIERS are

driving inside a long tunnel. With the CMS device inside, Selvig

carefully picks up the small cylinder shape IRIDIUM with metal

prongs and lightly places it a SLOT within the CMS. THE CMS

ACCEPTS IT. Selvig looks at it, devilishly smiling.

INT. BRIEFING ROOM  NIGHT

On a SHIELD monitor is a photo and record of JANE FOSTER. Thor

looks at her, remembering. With him is Agent Coulson.

Thor walks over to the side of the ship and looks out the

window, lamenting about what has happened and what may come.

Thor doesn't answer.

INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION  NIGHT

Loki walks back and forth inside his glass cell. Suddenly, he

stops.

I wanna know what you've done to Agent

Barton.

I'd say I've expanded his mind.

And once you've won. Once you're king

of the mountain. What happens to his

mind?

Is this love, Agent Romanoff?

Love is for children. I owe him a debt.

Tell me.

Before I worked for SHIELD, I

uh...well, I made a name for myself. I

have a very specific skillset. I didn't

care who I used it for, or on. I got on

SHIELD's radar in a bad way. Agent

Barton was sent to kill me, he made a

different call.

And what will you do if I vow to spare

him?

Not let you out.

Ah, no. But I like this. Your world in

the balance, and you bargain for one

man?

- Tony and Banner continuously work at their monitors.

- Agent Hill checks every VIEWSCREEN in the bridge. Fury

oversees.

- Steve opens a STEEL crate. Angry, he looks behind him and

looks back into the crate. THE CRATE IS FILLED WITH AN ARRAY OF

HYDRA WEAPONS.

INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION  NIGHT

Loki SLAMS his cell, making Natasha FLINCH.

NATASHA turns around, walks away from Loki, disgusted.

Natasha quickly walks out, leaving Loki frozen.

INT. BANNER'S LAB  MORNING

Fury walks in SURPRISED to see Tony and Banner stop working on

the scepter.

Suddenly, Steve drops a HYDRA ASSAULT RIFLE on the table causing

Fury, Banner and Tony to turn around. Cap looks pissed.

Tony moves the computer screen towards Fury which shows plans of

THE WEAPONS.

At that moment, Thor and Natasha walk into the lab. Natasha

keeps her eyes right on Banner. Banner looks at her, PISSED.

Last year earth had a visitor from

another planet who had a grudge match

that leveled a small town. We learned

that not only are we not alone, but we

are hopelessly, hilariously, outgunned.

My people want nothing but peace with

your planet.

But you're not the only people out

there, are you? And, you're not the

only threat. The world's filling up

with people who can't be matched, they

can't be controlled.

Like you controlled the cube?

You're work with the Tesseract is what

drew Loki to it, and his allies. It is

the signal to all the realms that the

earth is ready for a higher form of

war.

A higher form?

You forced our hand. We had to come up

with something.

Nuclear deterrent. `Cause that always

calms everything right down.

Remind me again how you made your

fortune, Stark?

I'm sure if he still made Wait! Wait! Hold on! How is

weapons, Stark would be neck this now about me?

deep... I'm sorry, isn't THOR

everything?

Are you all really that Captain America is on

naive? S.H.I.E.L.D monitors potential threat potential

threats? watch list?

You're on that list? Are you more crack...

above or below angry bees?

Threatening! I feel

threatened!

As the "team" argues, they don't realize the BLUE GEM on Loki's

scepter is glowing brightly.

INT. AIRCRAFT CARRIER  DAY

Outside the HELICARRIER, a lone carrier slowly hovers over the

ship.

Inside, BARTON and his crew suit up and arm themselves. Barton

pulls out his hi-tech bow and arrows.

INT. BANNER'S LAB  MORNING

Back in the lab, the egos of these people keeping rubbing off

each other and at any moment, the shit will hit the fan.

OUTSIDE THE HELICARRIER

The ramp of the carrier opens. The carrier maneuvers next to one

of the large turbine engines. Barton stands at the base, holding

out his bow. He pulls out a GRENADE TIPPED ARROW. He points

right at the engine.

Then...Barton moves his AIM and points the arrow about a hundred

feet from the engine. He releases. The arrow flies out,but then

SHARPLY heads for the engine. The arrow is punctured onto the

engine. It has a visible timer which is COUNTING DOWN.

INT. BANNER'S LAB  MORNING

Back in the lab, Steve puffs up his chest at Tony, who just

stands there, unmoving.

Thor laughs at them.

Tony rubs his head. Moves away from Cap.

Banner slowly gets upset as he looks at Romanoff, who gets

unnerved.

BLACK WIDOW and Fury have their hands down to grab their guns.

BANNER LOOKS DOWN AND IS SHOCKED TO SEE HE'S HOLDING LOKI'S

SCEPTER. The computer beeps. They all turn to it.

Banner puts down the scepter and walks over to the computer.

Tony turns to leave, but Steve stops him.

At that moment Banner who's looking at the monitor notices

something about the Tesseract.

OUTSIDE THE HELICARRIER

Barton PULLS THE TRIGGER ON HIS BOW. The arrow then EXPLODES THE

ENGINE RIGHT OFF THE HELICARRIER!

INT. BANNER'S LAB  MORNING

Everyone is thrown in every direction. Steve, Fury, Thor and

Tony are thrown across while Natasha and Banner is down in the

lower equipment room. Steve looks up at Tony.

Steve helps Tony up and out of the lab. Fury sits up, clutching

his ribs. He puts on his EARPIECE.

INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE  DAY

PANDEMONIUM ERUPTS. Emergency alarms set off, fire extinguishers

activate near surrounding fires and every agent is in a spinning

scramble for their positions and armaments. Agent Hill keeps the

bridge as calm as possible.

INT. BANNER'S LAB  MORNING

INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE  DAY

Agent Coulson runs out of the bridge.

INT. LOWER EQUIPMENT ROOM, CARRIER  MORNING

Natasha looks over to Banner, who is breathing heavy, having

landed hard. He is gripping the grated floor to maintain

control, but his eyes are green, his face intense.

EXT. HELICARRIER DECK  DAY

Barton leads his men into the air ducts of the ship. They rappel

down into a corridor.

Two of his men follow him. They head towards the bridge.

EXT. ND HALLWAY, CARRIER  MORNING

Tony and Cap run through a dim, debris filled hall.

Cap peels off as Tony approaches a tech room. Inside, Tony's

IRON MAN suit stands waiting, lit above in all its glory.

INT. LOWER EQUIPMENT ROOM, CARRIER  CONTINUOUS

ON BANNER'S FACE in the dim light as he struggles to suppress

the rage, but his face is growing, changing slowly.

Natasha is pulling herself painfully free, talking to Banner...

Two approaching SHIELD soldiers arrive to check on her. She

furiously WAVES them away. They bolt out of there.

His voice has the change in it -- the bitter amusement is

morphing to a growled threat. Another explosion rocks the

carrier -- and he turns to look at her, transforming just as the

lights go out.

Banner suddenly starts transforming into the HULK and gives

Natasha one last knowing look. Natasha STRUGGLES FREE of the

rubble. She stops.

The HULK, sensing her, turns his head and puts on a face of a

disturb monster. Natasha JOLTS up the stairs with the HULK

chasing after her. Natasha maneuvers like a black widow should.

She rolls under a turbine, starts to crawl within the maze of

pipes. The HULK pulls them out from above the catwalk.

Natasha falls through under the catwalks and quickly and

stealthily escapes. The HULK lets out a ROAR OF RAGE unlike

anything. PRIMAL. Not human.

INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION  DAY

Loki looks up, smiling mischievously.

INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE  DAY

Fury RUNS in and sees the chaos has increased even more than

before. The HELMSMAN is in complete disarray.

EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE  DAY

CAPTAIN AMERICA, pushing with all his strength the door to

portside, sees SHIELD tech in full oxygen masks shoot fire

extinguishers and cover from sparks -- largely unable to do

anything.

Engine 3 is totally dead. A LARGE CHUNK of the port side in TORN

OFF.

Tony flies in his IRON MAN suit and gets close to the damaged

engine.

INSIDE THE SUIT

Tony observes within his viewscreen at the damaged engine and

its layouts.

EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE  DAY

IRON MAN begins PULLING on the stuck rotors. Looks over atSteve.

IRON MAN flies into giant cooling conductors. CAPTAIN AMERICA

JUMPS over to the other side of the broken railing. CAPTAIN

AMERICA gets himself to the control panel and opens it up. For a

man who grew up as a YANK, what the fuck is this!

INT. LOWER EQUIPMENT ROOM, CARRIER  DAY

Natasha continuously crawls under the catwalk. She stops.

Then...BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. The room vibrates. Rhythmically.

Natasha pulls out her gun and slowly walks out onto the catwalk

and spins.

...and then a ROAR. THE HULK. Natasha FIRES a shot into a liquid

nitrogen pipe that hits the hulk in face. The HULK SMASHES THE

SHIT OUT OF IT. Natasha begins to run through the maze of

corridors. The sound the monster is coming.

Finally, she reaches and a long corridor. As she runs, behind

her, the HULK TEARS up the hallway, coming at her.

Natasha turns to see, but the HULK SLAPS her into the wall,

SMASHING INTO THE GROUND.

The HULK marks his territory. Natasha looks up. A fear she has

never felt begins to seep out. The HULK raises his hand and IS

KNOCKED OFF HIS FEET BY THOR WHO TACKLES HIM INTO the next room.

INT. HELICARRIER AIRCRAFT PORT  CONTINUOUS

Both Thor and HULK roll across the floor. Every person runs the

hell out. Thor looks up at this magnificent beast. The HULK

stands up and moving like a boxer, wants Thor to make his move.

The HULK makes his move.

SWING AND A MISS. Thor swings his massive hand and almost knocks

HULK off his feet. HULK keeps swinging and missing, pissing him

off. Finally, he brings down his arm, but Thor grabs it and

wraps around it.

HULK lifts his arm up, to Thor's surprise, and he SENDS HIM

FLYING AS HE PUNCHES THOR'S FACE WITH HIS FIST.

EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE  DAY

IRON MAN continuously BLASTS broken debris off the turbine

engine. It's bad, but still fixable.

EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE  DAY

CAPTAIN AMERICA looks over at the other side where he was. He

sees the red lever and JUMPS towards it.

INT. HELICARRIER AIRCRAFT PORT  DAY

Thor CRASHES into another stack of crates. As he raises his

head, he feels something on his lips. BLOOD. As he swipes it

off, the ROAR of the HULK is not too far. Thor extends his hand

out.

The ROAR gets LOUDER and CLOSER. Thor focuses. His hand strains

toward mid-air. His eyes tight in concentration. The HULK runs

right at him. At the last second, MJOLNIR flies into his hand

and Thor UPPERCUTS HULK, WHO CRASHES INTO A FIGHTER JET.

HULK stands up, shaking his head like `what the fuck just

happened.' He SHAKES it off and ANGRILY rips off the TAIL of the

jet, TORQUES HIS BODY LIKE A GREEK DISCUS THROWER AND... HURLS

THE MASSIVE PLATE AT THOR.

Thor SLIDES and DUCKS under the tail. Jumping up, he throws

Mjolnir with all his strength, knocking the HULK head over

heels. HULK falls down, hammer in hand. HE tries to lift it, but

can't. Mjolnir rests atop his hand.

Struggle as he may, HULK wraps his hand around the hammer. The

hammer doesn't move. To no avail -- he strains with all his

might, SCREAMS from the effort, BELLOWING.

Thor jumps up again, KNEEING HULK in the face. Thor grabs his

hammer, jumps on him, using the hammer as a lock for his

CHOKEHOLD. Hulk tries to pull him off.

INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE  DAY

Fury and Agent Hill look over their monitors.

Agent Hill nods. She leaves to exit out, but a SLIDING GRENADE

appears.

The grenade goes off, sending her down the steps. Fury FIRES a

shot at the open entrance. He moves over behind the side of the

entrance. A handful of Barton's men enter. Watchful, ready,

waiting... Fury steps out, his GUN drawn.

A SHOOT OUT and HAND-TO-HAND ensues, but Fury is unable to stop

one of them, which is why he is shot in the head by Agent Hill,

who looks hot and sexy holding her gun.

INT. HELICARRIER ARMORY SECTION  DAY

Agent Coulson walks up the armory door. He places his head into

a FACIAL RECOGNITION SCANNER. Walks into the room.

INT. HELICARRIER AIRCRAFT PORT  DAY

HULK CRASHES from under the floor, sending Thor on his ass. HULK

grabs him by the neck.

INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE  DAY

A gunfight opens up. AGENTS exchange fire with brutally

efficient tactical soldiers.

EXT. SKY  DAY

ESCORT 606'S jet BANKS to the right, heading towards the

shuttle.

EXT. OUTSIDE SHUTTLE

ESCORT 606 PILOT slowly makes his way in. sees the action going

between Thor and the HULK.

A SHOWER OF BULLETS SPRAYS THE HULK EVERYWHERE. Thor ducks for

cover. The HULK turns around, letting out his PRIMAL ROAR. He

jumps up, TAKES A RUNNING START AND LEAPS...

ESCORT 606 PILOT LOOKS LIKE HE TOOK A SHIT.

HULK LANDS ON THE JET'S NOSE. THE JET SPINS WILDLY. As the HULK

tears it apart, ESCORT 606 PILOT pulls his ejection seat, but

HOLD THE FUCKIN' DOOR!

THE HULK CATCHES HIM, WAVES HIM AROUND AND THEN THROWS HIM AWAY.

ESCORT 606 PILOT pulls his parachute. THE JET EXPLODES. THE HULK

PLUMMETS TO EARTH, ROARING HIS SWAN SONG.

EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE  DAY

IRON MAN laser cuts a big piece of broken metal. He then JUMPS

on it, relieving the rotors.

On the other side, BARTON'S men enter the port side. CAPTAIN

AMERICA looks down, pondering if they are help. Evidently not as

they begin SHOOTING at him and throwing grenades.

CAPTAIN AMERICA jumps to the other railing and down with

Barton's men. He begins to TAKE THEM DOWN, even goes as far as

throwing one off. A few more enter, FIRING.

CAPTAIN AMERICA grabs a NOVESKE RIFLEWORKS DIPLOMAT (big word

for big fuckin' gun) and jumps back up to his position, firing

down at them.

INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE  DAY

The gunfight has gone down, but more of Barton's men enter and

are taken by Fury, who is confused as to why they keep coming.

Suddenly, Barton LOOSES an arrow down to the bridge and EXPLODES

critical spots. Barton releases a multi-tipped arrow towards

Fury, but instead hits his command desk, right above a USB

OUTLETS.

Fury FIRES at Barton, but is already gone. The arrow then self-

activates and inserts itself into the outlets, hacking every

single monitor and main frame. The hacking causes Engine 1 to

shut off. Suddenly, the HELICARRIER begins to DANGEROUSLY TILT

to one side.

INT. LOWER EQUIPMENT ROOM, CARRIER- DAY

Still shaken by the HULK ordeal, Natasha sits there, rocking

back and forth, after crying for a while. Summoning back all her

coolness, she touches her EARPIECE.

Natasha SPRINGS up and runs for Barton.

EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE  DAY

IRON MAN begins to push the rotor using BOOSTERS from his boots.

The rotors start propelling faster and faster as IRON MAN'S

BOOSTERS get more and more bright.

On the other side, CAPTAIN AMERICA continuously shoots at

Barton's men. Blinking at the wrong moment, CAPTAIN AMERICA

loses the upper hand and SLIDES off the railing, but grabs onto

a LOOSE CABLE.

INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION  DAY

Thor runs into the detention section where he finds Loki,

escaping.

Thor CHARGES at his brother. Loki walks up to him and CROUCHES

down to attack. THOR ONLY GOES THROUGH HIM. The false Loki

dissipates into nothingness. THE REAL LOKI comes out from behind

the cell door, which closes on THOR, locking him up. Loki

smiles.

INT. LOWER EQUIPMENT ROOM, CARRIER  DAY

Barton walks alone down the catwalk. In a lightning fast move,

Barton nocks an arrow, and points it at NATASHA. A hand-to-hand

fight ensues. Natasha CRAWLS her way around Barton, making

Barton to drop his bow, but pulls out a KNIFE on her.

INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION  DAY

Thor, in a fit of anger, SLAMS MJOLNIR onto the glass cell. To

his surprise, the cell door only CRACKS, but violently SHAKES

the ship. Loki stands there in caution, as does his GUARDING

SOLDIER.

Suddenly, GUARDING SOLDIER falls down like a tree. AGENT COULSON

stands there, holding PHASE 2 WEAPON PROTOTYPE.

Loki moves away from the switch.

A LOUD GASP. AGENT COULSON IS IMPALED THROUGH THE HEART. THE

REAL LOKI STANDS BEHIND COULSON.

Loki sends Agent Coulson against the wall. Agent Coulson slumps

down, breathing fast. Loki makes his way to the control switch.

He gives his brother one last look. Thor looks at him, hopeful.

Loki opens the HATCH. Thor still hopes. LOKI HITS THE BUTTON AND

DROPS THOR OUT OF THE SHIP.

INT. LOWER EQUIPMENT ROOM, CARRIER  DAY

Barton and Natasha continue attacking each other. Natasha

KICKBOXES Barton's face. Feeling that, Barton takes a SWING at

her, but she grabs his arm, TWISTING it. BARTON WRITHES IN PAIN.

Using his other arm, he tosses the knife over and begins to

SLASH at Natasha. She dodges every move, but finds herself in a

LOCK HOLD with him. As he forces the knife down, she BITES his

wrist. Barton lets go of the knife.

Natasha WRAPS her legs around his neck, FLIPS him over and arm

LOCKS him. She SLAMS his head into a pipes rail. Barton goes

down, hard. He looks up her, almost coming to his real senses.

Natasha COLDCOCKS him. Barton is out.

EXT. SKY

Thor, trapped in the glass cage, BOUNCES off the JUMBLING cell

pod. As it draws closer to land, Thor tries to swing at glass,

but misses. Land draws closer.

In a final attempt before crashing, Thor positions himself onto

the glass door and LEAPFROGS just as the cage is about to hit

the ground. The cell CRASHES into the shore as Thor crashes out

into the meadow.

INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION  DAY

Loki has no remorse as he looks down. He closes the hatch and

proceeds to leave. A WEAK VOICE.

AGENT COULSON SHOOTS LOKI WITH HIS PHASE 2 WEAPON PROTOTYPE,

CAUSING LOKI TO BE BLOWN THROUGH THE WALL BEHIND HIM.

INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE  DAY

Back in the bridge, Fury sees on his VIEWSCREEN that the hatch

has been open. Knowing Agent Coulson was sent there, he goes to.

EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE  DAY

IRON MAN continuously SPINS Engine 3, giving it all he has. THE

ROTORS ARE PROPELLING PROPERLY AND FAST. The HELICARRIER LEVELS

itself.

INSIDE THE SUIT

Tony lets go of the rotors. They spin by themselves. Tony is

then caught in one. He is now fucked. IRON MAN slips into the

rotors, getting chewed up.

EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE  DAY

CAPTAIN AMERICA CLIMBS up the loose cable and reaches the

railing.

BARTON'S MAN opens fire once more. CAPTAIN AMERICA pulls himself

up and finally PULLS the lever.

A VENT opens up from Engine 3. IRON MAN falls out, but the suit

heavily damaged, hardly keeping him up. IRON MAN heads for Cap.

BARTON'S MAN turns his AIM to IRON MAN, who TACKLES him into the

wall. IRON MAN rolls over, tired. Cap lets out a sigh of relief.

OUTSIDE THE HELICARRIER

The carrier that brought Barton and his team now leaves, taking

Loki and his scepter. The carrier flies into the distance.

INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION  DAY

Fury runs in finding Agent Coulson still alive, barely.

Agent Coulson looks away. Sighs his last breath. Nick Fury looks

on grimly at Coulson. The medical team arrives.

INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE  DAY

Agent Hill is being treated for a gash on her head, listens on

her headset, standing up.

INT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE  DAY

Steve and Tony listen in as well.

INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE  LATER

Fury gathers Tony and Steve back into the briefing room everyone

there has a look as if in a daze. A look of numb shock is shown

on their devastated faces.

Fury throws Coulson's CAPTAIN AMERICA TRADING CARDS on the table

towards Steve. Steve picks them up, STAINED WITH BLOOD.

Tony gets up and walks off, not wanting to hear it anymore.

EXT. MEADOW  DAY

Thor walks out far into the meadow. He looks down. MJOLNIR.

INT. ABANDONED BUILDING  DAY

Banner wakes up, in human form. He looks around and sees he is

IN A PILE OF RUBBLE and looks up at the OPEN CEILING HE CRASHED

IN. AND IS COMPLETELY NAKED. A SECURITY GUARD stands there,

amazed.

He throws Banner a pair of big pants. Banner pulls on his pants.

A beat.

INT. HELICARRIER MEDICAL ROOM  DAY

Barton is strapped down. Natasha watches over him as Barton

tries to shake off Loki's mind control.

You know that I do.

Why am I back? How did you get him out?

Cognitive recalibration. I hit you

really hard in the head.

Thanks.

Tasha, how many agents?

Don't. Don't do that to yourself,

Clint. This is Loki. This is monsters

and magic and nothing we were ever

trained for.

Loki, he got away?

Yeah. I don't suppose you know where?

I didn't need to know. I didn't ask.

He's gonna make his play soon though.

Today.

We gotta stop him.

Yeah? Who's we?

I don't know. Whoever's left.

Well, if I put an arrow in Loki's

eyesocket, I'd sleep better I suppose.

Now you sound like you.

Natasha sits next to her partner and friend.

INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION  DAY

Tony look at the empty cell container. He stands not saying a

word. Steve walks in.

Sometimes there isn't a way out, Tony.

Right. How did that work for him?

Is this the first time you've lost a

soldier?

WE ARE NOT SOLDIERS! I am not marching

to Fury's fife!

Neither am I! He's got the same blood

on his hands as Loki does. Right now

we've got to put that aside and get

this done. Now Loki needs a power

source, if we can put together a

list...

He made it personal.

That's not the point.

That is the point. That's Loki's point.

He hit us all right where we live. Why?

To tear us apart.

He had to conquer his greed, but he

knows he has to take us out to win,

right? That's what he wants. He wants

to beat us and he wants to be seen

doing it. He wants an audience.

EXT. STARK TOWER  DAY

Selvig works around the CMS device that has already been set-

upon the rooftop of Tony's tower.

INT. HELICARRIER MEDICAL ROOM  DAY

Steve walks in full uniform. Natasha looks at him, unprepared.

Barton walks out of the restroom. Looks at Cap.

Steve looks at Natasha and she nods her head to confirm Barton's

on their side.

- KRAKAKABOOM! A blinding BOLT OF LIGHTNING strikes down from

above, colliding on MJOLNIR. The explosion is massive. THE

MIGHTY THOR.

walks up to him, knowing.

A LOUD NOISE SCREECHES. Fury looks out to see IRON MAN flying

off as well as the QUINJET.

EXT. NEW YORK CITY SKYLINE - STARK TOWER  DAY

IRON MAN arrives at STARK TOWER where Selvig, ACTIVATES the CMS

device, holding the Tesseract.

IRON MAN aims his hands toward the CMS and FIRES. The energy

from his boosters SHATTERS with a deafening CRACK! Selvig falls

backwards. DOWN BELOW, CITIZENS OF NEW YORK look up at STARK

TOWER. IRON MAN stares in disbelief at the CMS ... unharmed.

TONY lands his SUIT and goes through the gauntlet and unsuits

him. LOKI looks up at him, smiling. They proceed to walk into

the penthouse.

INT. STARK PENTHOUSE  DAY

Loki walks in, holding the scepter. Tony casually walks down the

steps, towards the bar.

From underneath the bar table, Tony pulls on COLANTOTTE

BRACELETS, a honing device.

Loki TAPS Tony on the chest with his scepter. PING! Nothing.

Confused, Loki tires again. PING! NOTHING.

In anger, Loki GRABS Tony by the throat and FLINGS him across

the room.

Loki grabs Tony by the throat again.

LOKI THROWS TONY OUT THE WINDOW. Tony FREEFALLS down the tower.

From behind Loki, an elevator opens and a RED POD SHOOTS out.

The pod LASER SIGNALS the COLANTOTTE BRACELETS on Tony. The POD

begins to TRANSFORM into the MARK VII suit.

It LATCHES onto Tony. IRON MAN. The suit FLIES up before he hits

the ground or the gazing people. Loki looks up, angry.

Loki raises the scepter. IRON MAN FIRES at Loki, sending him on

his ass.

EXT. STARK TOWER  DAY

Selvig looks up at the sky. The Tesseract's energy BEAMS into

the sky. The beam then forms a VORTEX, which then opens up

ANOTHER PORTAL.

EXT. VASTNESS OF SPACE

A hole in space rips open, and from it, the CHITAURI ARMY SPILLS

out in FLYING CHARIOTS, carrying ENERGY RIFLES with a bayonet on

the end.

INSIDE THE SUIT

IRON MAN flies up towards the portal. From his shoulders, a

miniature multiple rocket launcher, pops out and FIRES. Like the

JERICHO MISSILE, several targets are taken down unlike no

missile. It's useless. THOUSANDS OF CHITAURI FLY OUT. IRON MAN

flies towards the city.

EXT. MANHATTAN  DAY

The CHITAURI UNLEASH. New Yorkers fill the streets, staring at

the fire fight in the distance. BOOM!!! The CHITAURI unleashes

BLASTS as it goes, blowing up cars, setting storefronts aflame.

AN EXPLOSION RIPS OUT THE WINDOWS OF THE TOP CORNER OF

BUILDINGS. FLAME AND STONE RAIN DOWN. A DOMINO-EFFECT OF

EXPLOSIONS RIPPLING ACROSS THE BRIDGE.

EXT. STARK TOWER  DAY

Loki walks onto the balcony as the SOUNDS of the CHITAURI rings

out. He admires his soon to be kingdom. THOR LANDS ON THE TOWER.

Loki turns to his ENEMY.

Loki and Thor rush at each other. They and their weapons

collide. The two battle -- Loki unleashing another pent-up rage

and jealousy, Thor having no choice but to defend himself.

EXT. MANHATTAN  DAY

SOLDIERS AND COPS have taken positions covering the streets.

They see from the sky, IRON MAN leading a trail of CHITAURI

Loki. Loki AIMS the scepter at the QUINJET and FIRES A BLAST OF

ENERGY. Thor gets to his feet, TACKLING Loki down hard.

THE QUINJET is soon caught on fire. HAWKEYE maneuvers one wing

of the jet. They SPIN and SLOW. DROPPING OUT OF THE AIR AS IT

PASSES OVER SKYSCRAPERS. Then... they SLAM into the street.

INT. QUINJET  DAY

With everyone okay, HAWKEYE and BLACK WIDOW unfasten their

seatbelts and open the ramp. CAPTAIN AMERICA runs down, followed

by HAWKEYE and BLACK WIDOW. Each one has their respected weapons

in hand.

EXT. FOUR WAY STREET  DAY

The TRIO arrives in the middle of a four-way street. Suddenly,

the city LURCHES to a stop. A DEEP, PRIMAL RAGE BELLOWS OUT.

With that roar, a SHADOW comes over them.

EXT. VASTNESS OF SPACE

From the portal, a FUCKING CHITAURI LEVIATHAN FLIES OUT!

Carrying hundreds of SOLDIERS, the CHITAURI LEVIATHAN PASSES

OVER the TRIO.

EXT. BRIDGE STREET  DAY

They look up, out of their element. From both sides, CHITAURI

SOLDIERS CLING OFF and attach themselves to the sides of the

buildings, sliding down. Some CRASH into these buildings and

begin FIRING from their ENERGY RIFLES at innocent people.

INSIDE THE SUIT

IRON MAN quietly flies behind and parallel with the CHITAURI

LEVIATHAN.

EXT. STARK TOWER  DAY

Thor holds down Loki's face straight ahead, forcing him to watch

the city falling to ash.

Loki looks at his brother, showing a sign of hope. Then... Loki

stabs Thor with a small knife. Thor keels over.

Thor gets up, KICKS Loki and lifts him into the air. Thor then

SLAMS him down, hard. Loki, bleeding, rolls over the edge. Thor

looks down. LOKI IS RIDING ON A FLYING CHARIOT. DOZENS of

CHITAURI follow his lead.

The TRIO runs behind upside taxis. They look up and see Loki

taking his band down the street and FIRES at the street IN A

CHAIN OF EXPLOSIONS. SMASHING CARS AND HURLING PEOPLE AS IT GOES

TERRIFIED PEOPLE running from Loki, looking over their

shoulders, coming straight at us. CAPTAIN AMERICA looks down the

bridge.

CHITAURI SOLDIERS that have landed near them and begin FIRING at

them. BLACK WIDOW pulls both pistols and FIRES. Turns to Cap.

HAWKEYE shoots an ARROW into the creature's head, gaining a few

seconds for CAPTAIN AMERICA as he falls down the bridge,

followed by an EXPLOSION.

Cap races over to the plaza, jumping over dozens of EXPLODING

cars. THE FIRST AVENGER RUNS LIKE A FUCKING CHEETAH.

HAWKEYE runs over a bus full of people. From the windows, SMALL

CHILDREN are held by their parents for HAWKEYE to pull them out

to safety. He runs over to the jammed door and JERKILY opens it.

People begin to run out.

BLACK WIDOW empties out her CLIPS. HAWKEYE fires ARROWS into the

ranks of the CHITAURI, hitting his mark each time he shoots.

EXT. MANHATTAN  DAY

The COPS continuously fire at the flying chariots. It's pretty

pointless. A YOUNG COP runs over to his POLICE SERGEANT.

CAPTAIN AMERICA jumps in front of them. They look up at this

ridiculous looking man.

Suddenly, an EXPLOSION comes up from behind Cap. An ENERGY BLAST

is blocked by his SHIELD. TWO CHITAURI SOLDIERS attack. The cops

watch in shock as CAPTAIN AMERICA FIGHTS them off with ease. The

Sergeant turns to his officer.

EXT. SKY LINE  DAY

IRON MAN swerves around a building and faces the CHITAURI

LEVIATHAN. He pulls out his miniature multiple rocket launcher

and FIRES. The CHITAURI LEVIATHAN ROARS in annoyance. The

CHITAURI LEVIATHAN turns to him.

IRON MAN flies away.

EXT. BRIDGE STREET  DAY

HAWKEYE TRIPS a CHITAURI SOLDIER and RAMS an arrow down its

throat. BLACK WIDOW gets her hands on an ENERGY RIFLE and

STICKFIGHTS the hell out of them.

WHACKS oncoming CHITAURI SOLDIERS. It's all too much on them,

until...

Lightning strikes down from the sky, channeling the blast,

firing the electricity out at the CHITAURI SOLDIERS around them.

They're blasted back in a massive shockwave. The CHITAURI

SOLDIERS convulse, drop dead to the ground. THOR TOUCHES DOWN.

Just then, BANNER ARRIVES ON A SMALL MOTORBIKE. Getting off, he

looks around the city.

INSIDE THE SUIT

IRON MAN comes out from behind a building. The CHITAURI

LEVIATHAN follows, impatiently.

EXT. BRIDGE STREET  DAY

The rest of the AVENGERS look up, getting ready and standing

still.

IRON MAN SWOOPS down the street. The CHITAURI LEVIATHAN also

swoops down, BARRELING down the street like a FREIGHT TRAIN that

keeps building and building its intensity.Banner looks behind.

Cap looks at him. Banner begins to walk towards the monster.

Banner's body starts to swell and stretch and harden. GREEN

SHOOTS THROUGH HIS BODY. THE HULK.

Aaaannndddd.........SSSMMMAAASSSHHH!!!! HULK POPS the CHITAURI

LEVIATHAN IN THE NOSE. THE CREATURE FLIPS OVER A 360.

IRON MAN, in mid-flight, extends his arm out and a ROCKET, ready

to shoot. IRON MAN FIRES -- the rocket hits a SOFT SPOT  LARGE

CHITAURI LEVIATHAN are BLOWN COMPLETELY AWAY. Real pain from the

CHITAURI LEVIATHAN. Other pieces of meat CATCH FIRE and

withdraw... SIZZLE as they hit the pavement. CAPTAIN AMERICA

raises his SHIELD to block them.

From above and on the buildings, the CHITAURI ARMY watches in

horror as a group of EARTH'S MIGHTIEST HEROES FIND THEMSELVES

UNITED AGAINST A COMMON THREAT. TO FIGHT THE FOES NO SINGLE

SUPER HERO COULD WITHSTAND! THE AVENGERS ASSEMBLE!

UP INTO THE NEAREST BUILDING, HULK RUNS UP THE WALL HITS SEVERAL

CHITAURI SOLDIERS, SNAPPING IN HALF.

HE DIVES TOWARDS A BUILDING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET,

THROWING THE DEAD CHITAURI SOLDIERS TOWARDS OTHER SOLDIERS. The

CHITAURI SOLDIERS fire at him. THE HULK BACKHANDS THEM, SEIZES

THEM AND WITH RAW POWER, THROWS THEM DOWN.

IN HIS MOST POWERFUL LEAP YET, THE HULK FLIES UP AND IS IN THE

MIDDLE OF A FLYING CHARIOT TRAFFIC JAM, TO WHICH HE SMACKS THEM

OUT OF ALTITUDE.

EXT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING  DAY

Thor grabs onto the tower. Raises MJOLNIR and KRAKAKABOOM! A

BLINDING BOLT OF LIGHTNING strikes down from above, colliding on

MJOLNIR. THOR AIMS THIS MASSIVE SHOCKWAVE TOWARDS THE PORTAL.

THOR CHANNELS THE BLAST AND FIRES THE ELECTRICITY OUT AT THE

CHITAURI SOLDIERS FLYING OUT OF THE PORTAL. THEY'RE BLASTED BACK

IN A MASSIVE SHOCKWAVE. THE CHITAURI SOLDIERS CONVULSE, DROP

DEAD TO THE GROUND. HE EVEN RIPS THE SHIT OUT OF A CHITAURI

LEVIATHAN, WHICH THEN FUCKING EXPLODES.

INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE  DAY

Back in the bridge, Fury sees on his VIEWSCREEN the destruction

going on in NEW YORK. Agent Hill walks up to him.

OH SHIT. Fury presses his screen.

EXT. ROOFTOP BUILDING  DAY

Atop the rooftop, HAWKEYE fires ARROWS into the streaming flow

of the CHITAURI RIDERS, hitting his mark each time. Hell, heeven

AIMS his bow behind him, WITHOUT LOOKING and releases the arrow,

EXPLODING a RIDER.

IRON MAN does so and leads towards TIGHT CORNERS and in

HAWKEYE'S view, who fires arrow upon and arrow, EXPLODING the

CHITAURI RIDERS. IRON MAN keeps leading CHITAURI RIDERS UNDER

TUNNELS, THROUGH OPEN PARKING GARAGES. He looks back. None left.

INSIDE THE SUIT

EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - CONFERENCE ROOM  DAY

We are looking INTO a conference room where office workers sit

around a table. But the NOISE has caught one worker's eye, then

another, and soon they are all rising, stepping to the window,

mesmerized by what lies beyond.

MOVE, USING HER FEET TO RUN UP THE CAR AND JUMPS UP ON CAP'S

SHIELD, WHO GIVES HER A BOOST WITH THE SHIELD. SHE GRABS ONTO A

FLYING CHARIOT.

[Note: The following sequence will take us through the action in

one extended shot.]

- BLACK WIDOW climbs onto the chariot and CUTS the turret

shooter's linkage to it. She then JUMPS on the rider and STICKS

her knives into his nervous system. She gets him to BANK over a

building.

- IRON MAN arrives and SHOOTS any other CHITAURI RIDERS

following her. He makes his way down to CAPTAIN AMERICA, who

fights off more CHITAURI SOLDIERS. IRON MAN points his HAND

BOOSTERS at his SHIELD. The energy comes off and Cap uses it as

a REFLECTION BEAM and takes down nearby CHITAURI.

- From above them, HAWKEYE sends down remaining arrows. He sends

one across the street, taking down a CHITAURI RIDER following

IRON MAN.

- Finally, we have THOR and HULK fight on top the back of the

INT. 42NDBANK  DAY

Dozens of civilians are gathered in bank. Tension and

uncertainty surround them. THREE CHITAURI SOLDIERS oversee them,

pointing their weapons at them. One of them charges a BOMB. It

BEEPS.

CAPTAIN AMERICA jumps through the window and throws his SHIELD

at the CHITAURI BOMBER. The TWO CHITAURI SOLDIERS aim their

rifles, but Cap heads for cover under a desk, which he KICKS at

them.

CAPTAIN AMERICA jumps over the desk, HEADLOCKS A SOLDIER, while

BACKHANDING another one over the railing. The crowd moves away.

A CHITAURI SOLDIER attacks him from behind and RIPS OFF HIS

HELMET. The bomb is beeping faster.

CAPTAIN AMERICA flips over the SOLDIER, grabs his SHIELD and

just as the BOMB is about to GO OFF, CHITAURI BOMBER dives for,

trying to stop it, but it GOES OFF, sending CAPTAIN AMERICA

through the window, landing very hard on a car. The civilians

HEAD...

SNATCH! LIKE A CAT, LOKI GRABS THE ARROW STRAIGHT OUT OF THE

AIR...LOOKS STRAIGHT AT HAWKEYE, SMILING...

BBOOOOMMM!!! THE ARROW EXPLODES IN LOKI'S FACE, CRASHING INTO

THE STARK PENTHOUSE PAD.

edge.

As Loki looks up, shocked at what just happened, THE HULK IS

LEAPING UP AND KICKS LOKI, HURTLING TOWARDS THE GLASS WINDOW. He

COLLAPSES as he hits the wall. THE HULK jumps in, ready to

attack. Loki ROLLS himself up in a flurry of broken glass,

STANDING UP TO THE HULK.

REPEATEDLY AND FINALLY THROWS HIM ASIDE TO THE GROUND,

FLATTENING LOKI.

LOKI WHIMPERS IN PAIN.

ARSENAL ON THE SUIT. The CHITAURI LEVIATHAN opens its mouth.

IRON MAN flies in and BURSTS out the other end, making the

wind is knocked out of him. He looks up with an overwhelming

sigh as a SMALL BAND of CHITAURI SOLDIERS rush towards him,

holding out their rifles.

INSIDE THE SUIT

EXT. SKY  DAY

IRON MAN catches up, now comes at the missile from behind. The

up into sky, towards the portal.

The suit begins to freeze. Tony looks in horror.

INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE  DAY

Every single agent CHEERS. Fury smiles. He tries to communicate

with Tony. NOTHING.

EXT. SPACE

We then see Tony's horror. AN ARMADA. The black sky is filled

with what must be ninety ships in a vague cluster. Most of them

hang still in the air. Some move swimmingly about.

IRON MAN lets go of the missile. It whistles off into the

blackness as IRON MAN IDLY falls back down the portal's opening.

The missile reaches the MAIN SHIP. The MAIN SHIP IMPLODES,

causing the entire ARMADA to burst into a supernova, creating a

spectacular heavenly display.

EXT. MANHATTAN  DAY

Suddenly, all of the CHITAURI SOLDIERS and CHITAURI LEVIATHANS

KEEL OVER and begin to SHAKE, then stop. They all fall over. THE

A beat.

INT. STARK PENTHOUSE  DAY

Loki crawls onto the stair, looking like a piece of shit rag

doll. He takes a few breathers, senses someone is behind him. He

turns TO FIND THE AVENGERS STARING AT HIM, PISSED.

THE HULK SNORTS AT HIM.

WEEKS LATER.

INT. SHIELD ANALYTICAL ROOM  DAY

In TV news montage about THE AVENGERS, we see various reports of

what happened. Some people agree that the avengers did good,

to a blocked area. Thor shakes hands with his team and gives

Selvig a hug. Tony opens the Tesseract's case.
