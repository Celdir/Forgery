FADE IN:

EXT. WIDE AFRICAN LANDSCAPE - MORNING

At first only darkness, then the rising sun paints in an

endless savanna from horizon to horizon. We hear savage drums

beating in the distance coming from some unknown place.

The sun clears the horizon. Suddenly it changes amazingly:

the white disc goes through a rapid series of color

transitions, from yellow to green to purple to an incredible

BLOOD RED. From it shoots a RED LIGHTNING BOLT.

The sky echoes with THUNDER.

We hear a HOWLING ethereal wind, but not a twig of the brush

stirs as bolt after bolt of RED LIGHTNING rips the sky, with

each one a TITLE or CREDIT appearing.

Under FINAL CREDIT snow is beginning to fall on the burning

blood-red savanna.

EXT. PLANE IN FLIGHT - DAY

I's a Twin Otter with the logo of some commuter airline. It

buzzes along over pleasant countryside, through a sky that's

almost unnaturally serene and filled with fleecy white clouds.

INT. PLANE IN FLIGHT - DAY

There are just two passengers in the cabin. One is DALE ARDEN,

a great looking dark-haired girl sitting by herself and

reading a book entitled "KARATE FOR THE SINGLE GIRL.... A

Guide to Survival In The City." A few rows forward, near the

open door into the pilots' compartment, is FLASH GORDON.

He's studying a football play-sheet, one of those diagrammed

things with X's and 0's for the players and dotted-line arrows

indicating the directions of movement.

Suddenly the plane makes a violent bump. It almost knocks

the book from DALE'S hand. She looks out the window with

sudden fright, tossing hair out of her eyes, in a gesture

that's habitual to her in moments of stress.

There's nothing to see outside but the pretty clouds. She

looks forward again and watches FLASH standing up easily,

leaning in t..e cockpit doorway to speak to the PILOTS.

INT. PLANE/ COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

(CO-P:ILOT, DALE, FLASH, PILOT)

As FLASH takes a bit of paper from the CO-PILOT, the plane

takes another jolt, even more violent than the first.

FLASH starts back to his seat. The plane jumps again, shudders

violently. He holds on, calls up front:

INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS

(DALE, FLASH)

The plane buffets. FLASH is sent reeling, catches hold of

the rack above DALE, lowers himself into the seat next to

her. He buckles fast, takes out a candy bar and offers it

to her.

EXT. SKY - POV FROM PLANE WINDOW - DAY

The pretty white clouds are changing above and beginning to

surround the airplane. Over the engines we HEAR that same

ethereal wind rising which we heard in the opening. Slowly

and terrifyingly, the sun starts turning BLOOD RED. The clouds

race faster, faster, until they are actually streaming past

the plane from behind.

INT. PLANE - DAY

FLASH and DALE -- faces bathed in the eerie light. Speechless-

DALE grasps the football player's hand with all her strength.

EXT. A FANTASTIC GREENHOUSE - DAY

It is a huge and rambling, antique, standing in semiruinous

isolation in a pretty country landscape. The sun has turned

the SAME BLOOD RED we saw from the airplane, and clouds race

across it with unnatural velocity.

In the center of the greenhouse rises a glass-paned tower

through which we glimpse something MIRROR BRIGHT. Floating

high in the air above the structure are several silvery helium-

filled balloons, secured by wires. As we move closer, we

discern a MAN moving about actively on a platform inside the

central tower, about half-way up:

INT. GREENHOUSE TOWER - DAY

(MUNSON, TV NEWSMAN, ZARKOV)

The man is DR. HANS ZARKOV: big, bearded, feverish looking

and seemingly half mad with exhaustion. In striking contrast

to the antique greenhouse exterior, here there are all kinds

of computers and displays connected together in a slapdash

fashion. Quantities of neglected plants, most brown and

dead or dying, hide the works in here from outside view. As

Zarkov runs around throwing switches and eyeing displays, a

grim-voiced TV. NEWSMAN is appearing and speaking from a

good-sized television screen above the main control console:

ZARKOV whirls, slams the TV SOUND OFF and yells at the

silently mouthing NEWSMAN on the screen.

MUNSON, a scared looking assistant, comes running up the

stairs with a computer print-out sheet.

ZARKOV grabs it, eyes it.

BOOM! The TV screen EXPLODES in a fine shower of glass.

Stunned, MUNSON turns his head and glances at something big

and MIRROR BRIGHT gleaming behind foliage in center of tower.

Perfectly calm except for the maniacal glint in his eyes,

ZARKOV pulls out a revolver and points it at MUNSON.

INT. COCKPIT TO SKY - POV

(CO-PILOT, PILOT)

The PILOTS watch these clouds also, transfixed with disbelief.

They speak with that incredible calmness characteristic of

professional airmen in a moment of impending catastrophe.

The directional needles are going crazy. All the instruments

are going crazy. Displays flash impossible symbols. The

PILOT gapes at them a moment, then returns his gaze to the

sky and swallows.

The racing stream of clouds is parting open like in some

surreal painting. From the cortex LASER-like bolts of RED

LIGHTNING shoot out. Like a missile, one zaps right over the

plane's nose with a horrible crackling NOISE.

The CO-PILOT reaches up and hits the flap control. There is

a whooshing crackling ZAP! The whole cockpit FLARES OUT

with an intolerable blinding flash of RED LIGHT.

INT. PASSENGER CABIN - CONTINUOUS

The cockpit door flys off its hinges, admitting a gale of

wind that scatters FLASH'S play sheets like autumn leaves.

FLASH unsnaps his belt, leaps up and races forward.

INT. COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS

(DALE, FLASH)

The TWO PILOTS are gone, vanished without trace. Wind from

the shattered windows assaults FLASH as he charges in. He

stumbles forward as the plane noses into a dive. Recovering

he scrambles into the left-hand seat, grabs hold of the

bucking wheel yoke, pulls back and kicks at the rudder pedals.

DALE lurches in against the tornado.

DALE staggers into the co-pilot's seat, pulls back on the

wheel in front of her.

SHOOTING FORWARD - THROUGH THE BROKEN WINDSHIELD

The Earth is approaching fast, wheeling and tilting. We get

a glimpse of a strange greenhouse structure at the end of a

flat area.

Another barrage of crackling RED LIGHTNING BOLTS shoot all

around the plane but just miss it.

INT. COCKPIT

EXT. ZARKOV'S GREENHOUSE - DAY

Its thousands of panes reflect the RED SUN and the RED BOLTS

which rain down in intermittent bursts. One strikes an end

of a gallery, exploding glass and foliage. From inside, we

HEAR a furious echoing VOICE:

INT. GREENHOUSE - DAY

(MUNSON, ZARKOV)

ZARKOV is on the lower stairs of the tower, aiming his

revolver. MUNSON emerges from some dry brown bush where he

was hiding.

MUNSON starts walking away, toward the door at the end of

the long side wing.

If you woo't come, who will I find:

MUNSON ignores him totally, keeps walking away. ZARKOV lifts

his revolver and draws a bead on the man's back. Just as he

is about to shoot, he reacts to something outside.

EXT. GREENHOUSE

Amazingly, a Twin Otter is gliding in to a horribly rough

landing in the field outside. The plane hits on one wheel,

bounces into the air, comes down again and keeps right on

rolling toward the greenhouse.

AS ABOVE - FEATURE MUNSON

SEEING the onrushing plane, freezing an instant then starting

to run. He hardly gets five yards before the Twin Otter comes

SLAMMING IN through the greenhouse wall, burying MUNSON

totally under the wreckage.

INT. COCKPIT - DAY

(DALE, FLASH)

Crazily angled, filled with dust and smoke. Dazed, blood on

his forehead, FLASH struggles from his seat.

FLASH helps her from the wrecked seat, wheels and kicks out

the emergency exit in the cockpit area.

INT. GREENHOUSE - DAY

(DALE, FLASH, ZARKOV)

FLASH lowers DALE to the ground, jumps down after her. ZARKOV

is there, smiling at them in a strange way.

ZARKOV turns and smiles at them again as they start up the

tower stairs. SUddenly DALE stops short, staring at ZARKOV

with a funny expression.

ZARKOV hesitates just an instant, the nods.

DALE breaks off, almost biting her tongue.

FLASH is baffled, but he gets her urgent look.

Now it's FLASH'S turn to break off. ZARKOV is pointing a

gun at him.

HOWL of ether-wind increases. Storm of RED LASER BOLTS. Glass

showers them as parts of the green house EXPLODE and dry

foliage bursts into FLAME.

ZARKOV jabs the revolver into DALE'S back. RED BOLTS zap

around. FLASH whispers to her as they start running up ahead

of ZARKOV.

Below them, bottom of staircase disintergrates in a RED FLASH.

INT. TOP LEVEL OF GREENHOUSE TOWER

(DALE, FLASH, ZARKOV)

ZARKOV rips away a screen of foliage, revealing a MIRROR

BRIGHT capsule, seamless but for one door. He yanks that

open.

On every side things are blowing up and burning under the

merciless rain of bolts. One strikes the capsule head on,

but does not even leave a mark.

DALE gasps and shrinks back.

FLASH is poised to jump, but ZARKOV suddenly pushes DALE off-

balance, INTO the capsule. FLASH leaps after her.

INT. CAPSULE

(DALE, ZARKOV)

It is curiously transparent from the inside, mirrored only

on the exterior. There are some controls and displays, but

in general the interior is severely ascetic: as far removed

from conventional spacecraft as ZARKOV's solitary genius is

from everyday science.

Immediately starting to set switches in a frenzy of activity,

ZARKOV waves the gun at FLASH.

ZARKOV wheels and pulls the door shut. FLASH jumps him. He

punches ZARKOV in the gut. ZARKOV slams him back with the

well-known strength of a madman. FLASH clobbers him again.

Falling, ZARKOV dives sidewards and hits a switch.

The capsule WHINES SOFTLY and begins to WHIRL. Looking out

through the transparent wall, it is as if the capsule itself

was motionless and the scene outside is whirling. What's

left of the greenhouse is under a constant rain of those

LASER BOLTS, flashing fire that makes us dizzy.

FLASH staggers to his feet and finds DALE, folds his arms

around her protectively. The centrifugal force is rapidly

increasing now, throws them both against the wall. Faster

and faster, whirling, the force presses DALE'S body back

against FLASH'S until they are almost one flesh.

We move over and find ZARKOV plastered against another part

of the whirling capsule, his face drained white and distorted

by the terrific G-Force operating here now, his lips moving

as he speaks with enormous effort:

ZARKOV'S eyes close. He loses consciousness.

EXT. GREENHOUSE - LONG SHOT (MINIATURE)

Totally ablaze within now, one huge fantastic jewel of fire.

The whole central tower explodes outward. From the inferno a

MIRROR-BRIGhT capsule slowly rises, hovers, begins picking

up speed again as it ascends.

EXT. CAPSULE IN FLIGHT

Whirling, whirling, invincibly unharmed by the LASER BOLTS

which glance off it again and again, accelerating up into

space.

EXT. CAPSULE IN FLIGHT - POV

The EARTH recedes below into a ball, RED-HUED' under the

fantastic sun. A fast approaching light FLARES up against

the mirrored surface and is recognised as our MOON. It flashes

past, follows EARTH into e distance. All around, the sky

darkens into the void of space.

FANTASTIC MONTAGE - OUTER PLANETS OF OUR SOLAR SYSTEM

They hurtle past the capsule in rapid sequences:

A sudden gauntlet of careening ASTEROIDS, all sizes, from

tiny zingers to one almighty tumbler big as AFRICA.

Mammoth JUPITER with thirteen moons and its atmosphere of

deadly methane clouds more than 1000 miles deep. The RED

PATCH on its surface is a storm 20,000 miles across which

has raged without intermission for 200 EARTH centuries.

Through the RINGS OF SATURN in a dazzling LIGHTSTORM of

blazing ice crystals.

NEPTUNE, PLUTO, outermost URANUS. One after another the

planets are left hurtling behind, wheeling in their concentric

orbits, the entire SOLAR SYSTEM dwindling into nothing.

EXT. A SPIRAL NEBULA

It tilts and wheels wondrously as the Capsule passes through

the middle of it. Considering that this Nebula is probably a

million light-years from edge to edge, we get some notion of

the Capsule's speed.

EXT. A BLACK HOLE IN SPACE

Curving light-rays from another galaxy are drawn fantastically

together and then simply DISAPPEAR as they are pulled in by

the unimaginable gravitation force of is THING. we SEE the

CAPSULE, tiny, curving, and spinning along amidst the mind-

blowing display of light rays, sucked along with them

then simply DISAPPEARING as it too enters the void.

EXT. CAPSULE IN FLIGHT

(KLYTUS, MING)

Visible again, gleaming in an AMBER GLOW. Suddenly a dancing

grid of lines appears OVER IT, making us realise that we

must be SEEING IT on some kind of screen. It BLURS out of

focus, comes back again more sharply as some adjustment has

apparently been made.

ECU - EYES OF MING THE MERCILESS

Deep in shadow, gleaming with evil amusement.

MONTAGE - ECU'S OF MING'S FACIAL FEATURES

Curve of lip, flare of nostril, fold of eyelid, gleam of

shaven scalp, each a menacing landscape of sensual shadow as

INT. CAPSULE - SHOOTING FROM WITHIN

Through the transparent walls as the spinning motion is

rapidly SLOWING DOWN. The three voyagers are crumpled on the

floor against the wall in strange attitudes, FLASH'S arms

still holding DALE. They seem semi-conscious, as if dropped.

An AMBER GLOW bathes them, and soon we see its source. A

huge planet wheels into view through the transparent wall.

It is MONGO. Its curved surface is a pure sea of AMBER FIRE

molten lava, with great tongues of flame erupting

horrifically.

ZARKOV blinks, struggles to focus his eyes. He succeeds,

with horror SEES where they are headed. Making a choking

sound, ZARKOV stirs and tries to crawl over to a control

panel. He pushes switches. Nothing happens. The CAPSULE

keeps on going down. A great leaping tongue of fire licks

it.

Suddenly, just as destruction seems imminent, the capsule

miraculously changes its flight path and soars above the

remaining flames.

It races through them. A shadow passes over MONGO as the

CAPSULE passes through a wall of PURPLE VAPOR and emerges

above a totally different landscape. A dozen VARIOUS COLORED

CLOUDS sweep past in silent majesty.

The CAPSULE slows, hovers starts straight down into a sea of

high grass.

EXT. MONGO -- GRASSY AREA - EVENING

In the distant B.G. against an extraordinary SUNSET SKY,

rises the shimmering CITY OF MONGO.... a place of many levels,

golden tiers and turrets, towers, flags and pennants. It is

like something dreamed.

Several STRANGELY ARMORED MEN watch the MIRROR-BRIGHT CAPSULE

descending slowly. The LEADER waves and they all start toward

the CAPSULE.

INT. CAPSULE

(DALE, FLASH, ZARKOV)

Gentle bump as the thing touches down.

Suddenly DALE gasps, reacting to something she SEES through

the transparent-from-within wall. They all look around and

SEE those STRANGE MEN approaching.

EXT. GRASSY AREA - DAY

(ARMORED MEN, FLASH, LEADER, ZARKOV)

The door of the CAPSULE is opened from the inside. ZARKOV

and DALE and FLASH get out. THE MEN stop. Long beat as the

two parties gaze at each other, the first human eye ever to

see an extraterrestrial being. FLASH walks up to the leader.

With a warm grin, FLASH extends hi right hand.

CLACK! With lightning speed a manacle is slammed on FLASH'S

wrist and he is thrown to the ground as other RED MEN advance

to handcuff DALE and ZARKOV.

Groggily, FLASH lifts his head towards ZARKOV.

EXT. GRASSY AREA - POV THROUGH OPENING

(DALE, FLASH)

Another strange glimpse through an opening. Some fierce

tethered BEAST is being goaded and tormented by MONGO MEN,

as in an Elizabethan bear-baiting. On the floor lies the

tor n body of one MAN who apparently got too close.

DALE has one brief horrified GLIMPSE of this, then turns her

head away and shuts her eyes as she's marched along.

INT. MAIN PALACE HALL

A gigantic STATUE comes into view amidst topless columns at

the end. Light plays over it in ever-shifting patterns. As

we come nearer, we SEE that this STATUE is cut out in the

middle to form a throne.

MING THE MERCILESS sits in the throne niche, silent, gazing

down on the PRISONERS as they are marched to a halt before

him.

A hundred reduplicated ECHOES of that shout ring through

unseen reaches of the palace. MING bends his head slightly

in acknowledgement, points idly at the ARMORED MEN at the

left of the group.

INT. PALACE OF HALLS - SERIES OF DISSOLVES

(ARMORED MAN, AURA, DALE, FLASH, KLYTUS, LEADER, MING, VOICES,

As FLASH, DALE and ZARKOV are marched along by many ARMORED

MEN, perspectives are bewildering, curvilinear, surfaces

bending away into caverns of gloom without measurable

dimension.

We pass an archway opening into what seems to be an AMUSEME-

NT ARCADE. Glimpse of MONGO PEOPLE playing amazing electronic

games, while MONGO GO-GO GIRLS cavort on a platform to

unearthly music.

Look down over a balcony from a MOVING POV. A fencing glass

is in session. SIX PAIRS OF MEN go at each other with magic

swords which give off pyrotechnical displays each time the

blades clash. Thrust, parry, SLASH! The head of one duellist

EXPLODES in a bloodless fountain of fire.

The designated one marches two paces forward, halts.

Instantly the ARMORED MAN pulls his sword, rips open his

breast-plate, sets the sword hilt-down on the floor and

PLUNGES FORWARD on to the fatal point.

With a little cry of horror, DALE shrinks back into FLASH'S

arms.

There is a low throaty LAUGH from the shadows. FLASH and

DALE turn their eyes quickly in its direction.

FEATURE PRINCESS AURA

Emerging half into the light beside a column, fondling the

head of an obscure BEAST slouching between her legs.

Voluptuous beyond her years, fiercely erotic, AURA looks

FLASH boldly up and down as the BEAST HISSES with the pleasure

of her touch.

FLASH can't take his eyes off her. No normal man could. FLASH

swallows with a dry throat as AURA'S gaze devours him. DALE

gets the electricity going on, gives him a poke and WHISPERS

LOUDLY.

AURA laughs again, sidles up toward MING. We dimly SEE a

couple of MUTANT CREATURES dragging away the lifeless body

of the one who so vividly proved his loyalty.

MING looks questioningly at KLYTUS

The palace rings with an answering chorus: VOICES of all the

ARMORED MEN and numerous others presently UNSEEN, including

many WOMEN.

DALE doesn't move. MING takes a step down, narrows his eyes

and gazes at her intensely. This guy's personal magnetism

is enormous. As if irresistibly drawn, DALE steps forward.

MING moves his hand in a gesture. A sourceless GOLDEN LIGHT

bathes DALE, sensuous MUSICAL CHORDS are heard. DALE's lips

open slightly, her color heightens, her rate of breathing

increases. MING touches her flesh lightly.

FLASH tense, ready to spring.

MING flashes a glance of interest at ZARKOV, then addresses

the LEADER of the ARMORED MEN.

ZARKOV is roughly seized. FLASH starts after them angrily

as they drag the scientist away.

Languidly, MING indicates FLASH GORDON with a pointed finger.

Shock reactions. FLASH wheels back at MING as DALE steps in

front of her friend.

CLOSE ANGLE - AURA

Wetting her lips, moving sinuously to WHISPER to MING:

AURA touches the rime of MING'S ear with her tongue as she

As MING steps quickly away from his super-provocative daughter

and indicates DALE.

A HOODED GUARD comes from shadow, moves towards DALE.

FLASH starts around to defend her, but before he can do it

DALE has made her own move. WHAM! Quick as lightning, she

flattened the HOODED GUARD with a perfectly executed city-

girl's kick to the balls. DALE is astonished at her own

prowess.

Three more HOODED GUARDS are emerging from the shadows towards

DALE.

FLASH flies at them. An elbow in the mouth disposes of one.

He seizes the man's mace-like club as he falls, uses it

quickly to knock cold the other two.

AURA'S eyes shine at FLASH'S prowess. Fascinated, she runs

her moist tongue along the cutting edge of her teeth.

Panting, braced, FLASH stands in front of DALE with raised

mace.

Unearthly MARTIAL MUSIC comes in a glissando from the

Cavernous space above.

To its tempo MING'S PERSONAL GUARDS now starts appearing.

They are all a race of AMAZON WARRIORS, and the most amazing

thing is that they all have the SAME FACE.

From left to right, back and front, the AMAZONS advance 0n

FLASH and DALE. They do not attack, merely stun ad overwhelm

us with their massive, silent, answerable threat.

FLASH swallows, looks this way and that, stands as if

paralysed.

The AMAZONS are all around DALE now.

FLASH is paralyzed by indecision one beat more, then suddenly

makes up his mind. He flies into action, SLAMS the nearest

pair of AMAZONS.

INT. PALACE - FIGHT SEQUENCE

Fast and furious. Great havoc is wreaked by DALE and her

karate, by FLASH and his flailing fists, but the AMAZONS'

numerical superiority is of course decisive.

Soon FLASH is on the floor, pinioned by a dozen AMAZONS.

He looks up, with despairing eyes SEES poor DALE being dragged

up a flight of stairs that disappear mysteriously into upper

gloom.

The pitiful shout sends FLASH'S adrenaline rushing. With a

superhuman effort, he fights free from the pile-up and dashes

after DALE.

INT. PALACE - ON THE STAIRCASE

FLASH struggles to get through to DALE.

DALE claws fiercely at the bare AMAZON arms and shoulders

that engulf her, reaches desperately back down for FLASH.

CLOSE SHOT - THEIR HANDS

Just touching their fingertips.

CLOSE SHOT - A STEP OF THE STAIRS

Opens like a yawning trap door UNDER FLASH'S FEET.

FLASH drops away with a YELL, in the very instant that AURA

comes running INTO THE SHOT and boldly JUMPS after him.

AURA is swallowed up too, a split-second before the trap

door step CLOSES again after them.

INT. PALACE - CU-MING

(KLYTUS, MING)

Watching that, as KLYTUS hisses into his ear.

MING glances at him, then back up the stairs at where DALE

has vanished. His face softens, his tone turns museful!

NO reply. MING turns his head and finds that KLYTUS is gone.

Vanished. Not particularly surprised or concerned, MING gazes

again toward the top of the stairs and answers his own

question with a licentious smile.

INT. A DARK METALLIC SHAFT - SHOOTING DOWN IT

(AURA, FLASH)

It is seemingly endless, faintly lt by phosphoresence from

below. We dimly make out the figures of FLASH and AURA falling

away from us, far below, falling, falling. We HEAR Hollow

echoing VOICES reverbrating up to us.

In answer, we instantly HEAR a titanic SPLASH.

INT. UNDERWATER (TANK)

FLASH plummets down, AURA right after him. Recovering balance

in a universe of bubbles, FLASH finds himself confronting an

enormous savage LUMINOUS FISH. Wheeling himself away in

fear and revulsion, FLASH encounters AURA. He seizes her

ankle as directed. Holding his beat, FLASH swims after her

through a maze of stalagmites growing up from the cavern

floor. AURA dives down, leads him OUT OF SIGHT through a low

opening.

INT. UNDERGROUND GROTTO

(AURA, FLASH, PLASH)

FLASH and AURA emerge from a pool of water. FLASH staggers

across and collapses on a fringe of beach. For sure, AURA'S

wet clinging robe doesn't make her look any less sexy. He

stares at her.

INT. UNDERGROUND CORRIDOR

(AURA, FLASH)

There are windows on one side, emitting a fierce GLARE. FLASH

follows AURA rapidly along. Suddenly he stops short, looking

in through the tinted glass.

WHAT HE SEES - PLASMA CAVERN

An infernal place, chief feature of which is a LAKE OF

SEETHING MAGMA that slowly rotates within a wide encircling

platform. The platform is piled with GLOWING RADIOACTIVE

GRAVEL, being shoveled into the magma by LIZARDMAN SLAVES

who toil in rythmic unison.

ANGLES - LIZARDMAN SLAVES

Showing ankle electrodes shackled to each SLAVE, so that

those who collapse can be shocked back to their feet by GUARDS

stationed on a surrounding catwalk above. Any SLAVE unable

to rise is summarily pitched into the magma by HOODED MEN,

waiting like executioners to perform this chore.

FLASH looks at AURA again, then back in the window. He

reacts.

INT. GROTTO - HIS POV IN CAVERN - ON A CATWALK

ZARKOV is being led along by SOLDIERS, heavily shackled. He

stops, gazing in wonder at the seething lake, which FLARES

UP BLINDINGLY with each shovel full of gravel.

FLASH and AURA

AURA takes his hand. With one backward look toward ZARKOV

who of course has not seen him, FLASH follows her.

INT. PLASMA CAVERN - FEATURE ZARKOV

(MING'S VOICE, SOLDIER, ZARKOV)

ZARKOV wheels in his chains, looks up.

INT. PLASMA CAVERN - MESSANINE

(EVERYONE, MING, ZARKOV)

High above this place where MING stands with KLYTUS, lit by

the infernal glare as he goes on:

At that instant a couple of worn-out SLAVES are pitched into

the magma. Their dying SCREAMS are drowned by the chorus

from all the minions:

INT. UPPER PALACE AREA - CORRIDOR

(AURA, FLASH)

AURA leads FLASH out through a doorway. He is now fitted out

with a fairly resplendent MONGO costume: boots, cape,

headdress and all. They hurry along through shadows. Suddenly

FLASH seizes her by the shoulders, stops her.

As she looks at him, she SEES a detachment of SOLDIERS

marching this direction. Quickly she pulls FLASH into a niche,

presses her body against his in the narrow space. WHISPERS:

The SOLDIERS have gone past, but AURA is still pressing

against him.

AURA hauls FLASH from the niche, they hurry on a bit further.

AURA stops in front of big doors, with glass windows in them.

FLASH takes one look into the glass, then swivels back to

INT. MING'S DOME

(MING, ZARKOV)

Open at the top to space. But instead of our familiar pinpoint

stars, here whole nebulae wheel in majesty against infinity,

their innards popping with explosions as whole galaxies are

born and die.

ZARKOV stands before MING in chains, mesmerized by fantastic

devices on every side. Most prominent is a huge transparent

cube, supported in the air above a control console. MING

moves to that, plays in it like an organist. we HEAR a soft

intense hum, GLIMPSE great dish-like radio antennae turning

on the top side of the dome.

An astonishing things happens. Inside the cube a recognisable

greenish globe appears like a three-dimensional holograph,

slowly turning as the continents and oceans come into view

below a veil of clouds.

A sudden TIDE OF FIRE sweeps the globe, Even the clouds BURN.

ZARKOV gasps as MING'S fingers dance of the control keys

again.

The fires recede. The hanging globe sparkles again with beauty

just as it was except that the outlines of our continents

have been subtly changed.

MING touches a key. The image of Earth DISAPPEARS from the

cube. ZARKOV glares hatred at MING for a beat, then his eye

catches something else.

WHAT HE SEES

A big block of crystal on the floor with two swords embedded

in it, just their hilts sticking out.

ANGLE to include ZARKOV. Chained as he is, he suddenly bounds

over and seizes a sword hilt, tries to pull it out. It doesn't

budge.

ZARKOV tugs desperately, but it doesn't give an inch. He

falls panting over the block.

MING laughs, makes a sign to a SOLDIER.

INT. MING'S SERAGLIO

(DALE, HEDONIA)

DALE stands amongst the EXOTIC FEMALES of this lavish place,

being gently but firmly divested of her clothes and put into

a diaphanous gown. They intend her no harm. Though each has

some slight unearthly peculiarity, all are very beautiful.

Tickled, DALE can't suppress a giggle. The females are amazed

and delighted by this phenomenon. They take turns poking at

her ribs as tall HEDONIA glides up, bearing a flagon of green

liquid.

DALE recoils, her giggling cut short.

With a karate chop, DALE- knocks the flagon away. HEDONIA

rubs her hurt wrist but does not seem angry.

HEDONIA retrieves the flagon from the silken pillow where it

landed, extends it again to DALE. A shout!

Of course there is no answer. Sudden tears of despair spring

from DALE'S eyes. She seizes the flagon and impulsively drinks

it. Her expression changes.

EXT. SPACE - AURA'S SHUTTLE CRAFT

Sails along, a wonderful little bubble-topped two-seater,

with royal devices.

EXT. SPACE - A MOON OF ICE

Floats toward us, dazzling sphere of frozen seas and glaciers.

INCLUDE AURA'S SPACECRAFT

Coming into SHOT in a curving pass over the surface. It's a

Nifty bubble-top two-seater with royal devices.

INT. COCKPIT - IN FLIGHT

There are no normal controls, just a glowing multi-colored

panel over which the pilot makes hand-movements to effect

changes of course and attitude. FLASH is in the left-hand

seat beside AURA, gazing down at the glittering sight.

FLASH shivers. Patches of frost and ice start to form on

the craft's bubble.

FLASH moves his hands over the panel. The craft pulls up

and banks.

INT. COCKPIT - ANOTHER SHOT

(AURA, FLASH)

Another moon RISING ahead. Its reddish desert surface is

swept by a raging sandstorm.

With a sudden thoughtful look, his head working.

FLASH just shakes his head. AURA watches him a beat more,

then reaches up and pulls down a curious gadget hanging above

her seat. It's a TRANSPARENT HOOD with strange fittings

inside, not totally unlike a beauty-shop hairdryer.

AURA just gives him a look and laughs. FLASH stares at her a

moment, then suddenly MOVES HIS HANDS sharply over the control

panel. The craft hurtles into a violent DIVE. AURA yells.

AURA drops the plastic hood, lunges to move. her own hands

on the controls, but FLASH seizes her wrists.

EXT. SHOOTING THROUGH BUBBLE TO EXT.

Showing the windblown surface of the moon ARDENTIA dead ahead.

INT. COCKPIT

(AURA, FLASH)

AURA struggles wildly, but FLASH'S grip on her wrists is

like iron. The surface of Ardentia LOOMS UP , closer and

closer.

INT. MING'S SERAGLIO - BATHING AREA

(DALE, FLASH'S VOICE, HEDONIA)

DALE is immersed naked in a bubbly swirling tub, a luxuriant

prisoner of the FEMALES who bathe and groom her. She seems

dazed by steam and by the sensuous movement of the water.

A couple of the FEMALES lift DALE'S hands, make a cup of

them. HEDONIA pours rich oil into it.

DALE starts to oil herself as the FEMALES exchange looks and

LAUGH softly. Suddenly a FILTERED VOICE is HEARD from nowhere,

though it seems very close:

She blinks, befuddled, pauses in her oiling of herself.

INT. COCKPIT

with the Thought Transference gizmo down over his head, a

faint BLUISH GLOW flickering within, as AURA watches him and

we SEE the moon Ardentia falling behind rapidly through the

glass. FLASH concentrates fiercely. We HEAR his VOICED

THOUGHTS but his lips do not move.

INT. MING'S BATHING AREA

(DALE'S VOICE, FLASH'S VOICE, FLASH' S VOICE)

Now we HEAR DALE'S VOICE, without her lips moving either:

INTERCUTS - FLASH AND DALE - SERAGLIO BATH AND COCKPIT

As they communicate. NOTE: There might be some faint glow

in the air above the tub some spectral suggestion. of FLASH'S

presence, the idea being to show that HEDONIA and other

FEMALES are unaware of this interchange going on as they

continue to bathe and groom DALE.

INT. CUTTING BETWEEN BATHING AREA AND COCKPIT

(DALE'S VOICE, FLASH'S VOICE, FLASH' S VOICE)

INT. COCKPIT - FEATURE AURA

who has been watching FLASH'S face with increasing frustration

and jealousy during this, Suddenly snatching the Thought

Transfer bubble OFF FLASH'S head.

He has a dazed dreamy look on his face. AURA slaps him out

of it, points-ahead.

EXT. ARBORIA - DAY

Green tangle of branches and leaves and vines. ANGLING UP ,

we SEE the SHUTTLE CRAFT approaching us head-on at a down

angle.

EXT. ARBORIA - SHUTTLE CRAFT POV

It races up toward the craft's windshield. We level off for

a moment, then PLUNGE DOWN again into a blur of green.

INT. COCKPIT - FLASH

Working his hands over the control sensors as crazy GREENERY

rushes by outside. THUMP THUD CRASH! The craft careens to a

swinging HALT, so Suddenly that FLASH and AURA almost have

their wind knocked out as they are thrown against their seat

belts. FLASH recovers.

EXT. SHUTTLE CRAFT

(AURA, FLASH)

It hangs snagged in a huge vine, like a creature caught by

some monstrous boa-constrictor. This is a complete world of

green, the light, the feeling of the air. Everything rings

with forest SOUNDS. The very sky is shut from view by leaves

and foliage.

The craft's hatch opens. FLASH struggles out, gives AURA a

hand up. Kneeling on the cabin, FLASH takes in this incredible

vista stretching all around.

Carefully, balancing lithely, AURA starts along the trunk of

the great vine that caught them.

INT. MING'S BEDCHAMBER

(DALE, SERVING GIRL)

Ultra-Byzantine splendor. The only light is by a huge bed

on which DALE reclines. A SERVING GIRL glides up with a

flagon of that liquid.

The SERVING GIRL leans over the bed to do so. We GLIMPSE

DALE'S HAND rising quickly to deliver a karate-chop.

INT. PALACE HALLWAY

MING walks down it toward a closed door at the end. He pauses

a moment in anticipation, composes himself, opens the door.

INT. MING'S BEDCHAMBER

It's nearly dark. MING comes from shadows, looks down at the

bed. There is a feminine silhouette on it.

MING sits, extends a hand. His FINGERS travel sensuously up

a BARE THIGH, suddenly stop.

Savagely, MING pulls the face of the GIRL into the light. It

is not DALE ARDEN but the unconscious SERVING GIRL, now

dressed in DALE'S gown.

INT. DUNGEON - MING' S PALACE

OPENING CLOSE on ZARKOV, who lies asleep in his chains. A

hand touches his shoulder.

ZARKOV wakes with a start to SEE a SERVING GIRL bending over

him, tray in hand. She moves her cloak to reveal that she is

DALE.

A GUARD stands nearby against a wall, faceless in the shadow

of a cowled uniform.

DALE quickly puts the tray down, stands and turns to the

GUARD She smiles invitingly, lifts her skirt up above her

knee.

The legs are long and terrific.

The GUARD catches his breath, steps toward her lecherously

to accept the invitation. WHAM! He doubles up as DALE kicks

him in the groin, goes down without a sound as a left-right-

left series of KARATE CHOPS hits his neck.

He is hardly on the floor before DALE is pouncing on the key-

ring at his belt.

EXT. ARBORIA FOREST - FLASH AND AURA

(AURA, FLASH)

Making their way swiftly through it between earth and heaven,

crossing this green world on branches and trunks of monster

vines. FLASH pauses.

Gently, provocatively, AURA puts her finger on his lips to

silence him.

EXT. ARBORIA - FULL SHOT

(AURA, FLASH)

Of a fantastic structure, many levels, built of wood and

other materials from the heart of the forest.

MOVE OFF it to find FLASH and AURA nearby, him gazing at

this apparition with a strange wistful expression.

AURA laughs softly, waves him on.

WITH FLASH AND AURA

climbing the ramp-like stairs which wind up around it in a

mounting spiral. SUddenly the forest rings with SINGSONG

CRIES and CALLS I mingled with a sort of ROARING SNARL.

AURA leads him on at a run to the wide balcony above.

EXT. FOREST - MOVING SHOT

With a desperate LION MAN, running full tilt; roaring and

snarling as he zig-zags this way and that.

There is a SWISHING SOUND and an arrow-like missile catches

him in the back. Sharp PFSSSSS: as of gas escaping.

EXT. FOREST - ANOTHER ANGLE

(ALL THREE MEN, TREE MAN)

BARIN, PRINCE OF ARBORIA and looking every inch the part,

stands with a fired crossbow. Over his shoulder is a quiver

of GLASS ARROWS, each a little POINTED CYLINDER at the end.

Some distance behind and around we see a number of his loyal

TREE MEN.

EXT. STRUCTURE - BALCONY

(AURA, FLASH)

FLASH -- BESIDE AURA ON BALCONY

FLASH'S eyes jumping to her as he hears that echoing.

EXT. FOREST - FEATURE BARIN

(BARIN, FLASH)

As the TREE MEN scurry to obey, BARIN moves forward, reloading

and cocking his weapon.

The stricken LION MAN comes INTO VIEW. Incredibly, the glass

arrow in his back has transformed him into a STATUE OF ICE.

At BARIN'S footfall, he DISINTEGRATES in a tinkling fall of

frozen shards.

THE TIGER MAN is poised behind a tree near the lodge, panting.

He is a magnificent creature, with a horn sticking out of

his forehead. He tenses, HEARING the BIRDLIKE CALLS of the

advancing hunters. Closer, closer.

ANGLE WIDENS. We SEE another PAIR OF LION MEN crouching

nearby, terrified. The line of TREE MEN comes INTO VIEW. The

crouching pair look in appeal to the TIGER MAN by the tree.

He watches a beat, waves them to run backward, then covering

the escape of the others, TIGER MAN charges into his enemies

headlong.

FROM LODGE BALCONY - POV SHOT

FLASH and AURA watch the fight. TIGER MAN'S rage is

magnificent as he flails the nearest TREE MEN without regard

for their number. He has flattened half a dozen when suddenly

BARIN'S upper line of TREE MEN leap DOWN on him from the

branches above, and he is buried under their sheer weight.

CU FLASH WATCHING

(BARIN, TREE MAN)

ANGLE - BARIN advancing by himself, HEARING the triumphant

SHOUTS of his men.

EXT. BALCONY - FLASH

Watching with horrified fascination as NETS are thrown over

the struggling TIGER MAN. AURA'S eyes bright with lust for

this kind of spectacle, AURA speaks low to FLASH

EXT. FOREST - BELOW LODGE

(AURA, BARIN)

BARIN walks up ahead of some TREE MEN who are carrying the

TIGER MAN in their nets. Suddenly he stops, reacting to

AURA on the balcony.

BARIN laughs.

INT. LODGE

(AURA, BARIN, FLASH)

FLASH is flattened against the wall, IWATCHING through louvers

of a door. SOUND of feet on ramp, SNARLING and ROARING of

captive TIGER MAN. BARIN comes hastening INTO VIEW on the

balcony and embraces AURA.

AURA AND BARIN CLOSE

His eyes alight with anticipation, BARIN steps back from

her. as his MEN arrive with the netted TIGER MAN.

AURA SMILES, turns and calls softly toward the interior.

FLASH steps out, halts about ten feet from BARIN. Reactions

from BARIN and his TREE MEN.

CU - FLASH

AURA darts INTO SHOT, puts her lips to his ear and WHISPERS:

AURA darts back into shot on his side now, WHISPERS in same

BACK TO SCENE

as AURA quickly steps away, continues aloud:

The sword BARIN ordered has been brought. He seizes it.

BARIN hesitates, provoked by that, then shouts:

ANGLE - SNAKE KEEPER

A HALFWIT TREE MAN, drowsing against another part of the

parapet, He jerks awake, shuffles across to a big wicker

basket, pulls off the lid. A hideous EEL-LIKE SERPANT rears

it's head, HISSING and SNAPPING venemously. The KEEPER sticks

his arm down. The snake coils around it. With a drooling

grin, the KEEPER withdraws it.

CU FLASH watching with horrified revulsion.

BACK TO SCENE

KEEPER carries the hissing snapping snake toward an enormous

STUMP of a tree trunk. He holds his arm out over it, WHISTLES

a curious note. The snake leaps off the arm and VANISHES

into the hollowed out trunk. We notice now that there are

SIX HOLES drilled into the gnarled wood.

A battle-scarred OLD TREE MAN steps forward. without a word,

he goes to the stump and plunges a hand INTO one of the holes.

INSIDE THE STUMP

BIG CU SNAKE with a hiss, fangs strike a wrist.

INT. LODGE - FEATURE OLD MAN

(AURA, BARIN, FLASH, TREE MEN)

With eyes widening in horror, hs face starts to turn BLUE.

He pulls out his hand and staggers backward. BARIN plunges

his sword into the man's breast and he topples over the

parapet, dead. Sword in hand, BARIN turns to FLASH.

He swallows, Looks at the stump, at BARIN with his bloody

sword, to the stump again, then at AURA. He crosses close

and stares into her glittering eyes.

BARIN'S sword touches FLASH'S back.

He walks to the stump. Every eye is on him, every breath

held.

With a sudden quick motion, FLASH plunges his hand into a

hole. He leaves it there a second, then whips it back out

and wheels to BARIN.

SHOTS -- AROUND THE GROUP

BARIN goes still. This is not what he had planned. AURA'S

Tongue runs over her tee.

AURA laughs softly. BARIN strides across, plunges his hand

into another hole, rips it out again unscathed. He whirls to

FLASH, points the sword at him.

FLASH thrusts into a third hole, pulls out again. Turns.

BARIN glares at him, takes a breath, jams his hand into the

fourth of the six holes.

BIG CU BARIN

His eyes widen horribly, he makes a choked sound. PULL BACK

FAST as he whips his hand out, unbitten. His face twists

into a grin.

AURA laughs, turns her smile on FLASH.

The point touches FLASH again. Just two holes left. He does

a silently mouthed eeny-meeny-miney-mo between them, plunges

his hand into one.

INSIDE THE STUMP

The snake's head MOVES fast.

BACK TO SCENE

QUICK CU - FLASH'S FACE

Wincing, contorting.

As FLASH whips his arm out again. Amazingly, he has hold of

the terrible serpent, grasping it just below the head. CRIES

from the astounded TREE MEN, and then FLASH is leaping INTO

ACTION.

Whirling, FLASH swings the hissing snapping writhing beast

at the nearest TREEMEN, scattering them, and thrusts the

serpent's head at BARIN.

BARIN slashes with his sword, misses. The serpent's tail

coils around the blade, rips it from BARIN'S hand as the

Prince of Arboria dives backwards.

FLASH whirls again, SLAMS the serpent's head into a post,

and SNATCHES the sword from the tail before it hits the floor.

MOVING WITH FLASH

He dashes for the ramp to the ground.. The TIGER MAN is right

in front of him, struggling in the net. FLASH pauses, SLASHES

at the cords. TIGER MAN is freed, bounds to his feet with a

ROAR, clobbers a pair of TREE MEN just jumping on him and

FLASH. Snatching one's CROSSBOW and QUIVER OF GLASS ARROWS,

he races down the ramp behind FLASH.

BACK TO TOP LEVEL

Picking himself up, wheeling furiously on AURA, who has been

watching all this with her lips half parted, her tongue

flicking teeth in supersensuous excitement.

BARIN snatches a horn from his belt, blows a BLAST.

EXT. FOREST - FLASH AND TIGER MAN

(FLASH, TIGER MAN)

They run through the green tangle. FLASH trips over a vine.

TIGER MAN picks him up.

SOUNDS echo: hunting horns, birdcalls of TREE MEN. They start

running again.

Ahead is a huge tree made for climbing: branches stick out

like the rungs of some great green ladder. They leap onto

the lowest.

ANGLES - THE TREE - FLASH and TIGER MAN

Climbing. Jack and the Beanstalk, up and up, panting, but

there is never a top in sight. Suddenly the branches end.

TIGER MAN reacts to something off. Touches FLASH'S shoulder

and points.

THEIR POV - AT END OF LAST BRANCH

A crazy sort of ELEVATOR is going by. It's a moving. vine

with LEAFY BASKETS attached, a vertical conveyor from the

ground to above. As FLASH and TIGER MAN watch, they SEE one

basket moving UP with an armed TREE MAN in it, scanning the

forest below.

Snatches the crossbow off TIGER MAN'S back, cocks it, notches

it quickly with a GLASS ARROW from the quiver.

INCLUDE THE TREE MAN

hearing the CLICK of the cocking. He wheels, looks up, SEES

FLASH. Letting out a fierce BIRDCALL. he jumps up and swings

his own crossbow just as FLASH shoots.

SWISH-PFFST as FLASH'S arrow hits him. ICE, he tumbles out

of the basket.

FLASH and TIGER MAN

Run out along the branch, jump INTO the basket as it passes

by.

EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE TREES

(BARIN, FLASH, TREE MAN, TIGER MAN, TREE MAN LEADER)

BARIN and a troop of TREE MEN are poised in the branches,

listening acutely. The one scouting in front calls back:

TREE MA.i. The sight-call carne from the left:

He BLOWS his horn again. The TREE MEN start moving quickly

some climbing, others SWINGING laterally on vines.

IN THE BASKET

FLASH and TIGER MAN

Rising looking upward, as the light through the leaves is

changing, becoming less intensely green.

A DOZEN TREE MEN come swinging into view on vines, land on a

fat branch. The LEADER looks right in this direction, points

and gives a chilling BIRDCALL. The TREE MEN unsling their

crossbows, reach for GLASS ARROWS.

FLASH and TIGER MAN

SEEING cold death staring them in the face.

FLASH reaches for an arrow, notches it.

FLASH makes like to throw his crossbow away. At the last

instant, h swings it around, aims and FIRES.

TREE MEN ON BRANCH

Are startled as the arrow WHIRRS in and sticks into the branch

under their feet. The branch instantly turns to ICE.

BARIN - CLIMBING FROM BELOW

HEARS a loud brittle CRACKING SOUND. He looks up, gapes,

holds on tight to the tree trunk. A dozen SHRIEKING TREE MEN

plummet down around him amidst chunks of ICE, crashing through

the branches to doom. A look of fierce delight on his face,

BARIN resumes his climb.

EXT. TREETOPS OF ARBORIA

(FLASH, TIGER MAN)

FLASH and TIGER MAN jump from their basket into a wide leaf,

near a loading platform where the elevator-vine goes around

a great iron wheel. The forest is open to the sky at this

altitude, a sunny Eden of huge exotic flowers. Enormous

overlapping leaves form a floor FLASH and TIGER MAN can stand

on.

FLASH quickly checks his wristwatch and the angle of the

shadows, starts in the direction he estimates is west.

TREETOPS OF ARBORIA - OTHER ANGLES

FLASH and TIGER MAN running over the leaves, which are

somewhat BOUNCY like a huge trampoline. It's quite enjoyable.

FLASH laughs aloud at the sensation, takes a big jump off

the edge of one leaf, BOUNCES HIGH from the next.

Amazingly, a fat TENDRIL seizes him in mid-air, coils around

his waist. FLASH yells as he is lifted further up.

AN ENORMOUS FLOWER

is right above him. The closed petals open. The inside is

viscous, hideous looking. In the deepest recess is a dark

red blob which PULSES like a huge heart, emits a BEING SOUND.

With horror, FLASH realizes the tendril is feeding him into

the flower's maw.

PLASH struggles vainly against the tendril's strength. TIGER

MAN dashes to his rescue below, but another tendril knocks

him flat.

INT. FLOWER

(BARIN, FLASH)

FLASH is conveyed INTO the flower. He punches wildly with

his fists, kicks, but petals are CLOSING inexorably around

him. On their inner surface are deadly spiny SPIKES.

Scattered around are the crushed SKELETONS of luckless TREE

MEN who have been fed in here.

SWISH-PFFFFST! Out of nowhere a GLASS ARROW comes flying

past FLASH'S ear, sinks itself into the flower's heart. The

flower SHRIEKS. All around, FLASH, it is turning into

crystalline ICE.

The tendrils lose their grip, FLASH falls onto the leaf below

beside the TIGER MAN.

TREETOPS - ANOTHER ANGLE

As FLASH turns his head to see BARIN standing with his

crossbow on a leaf some twenty feet away.

BARIN notches another arrow, cocks his bow, with slow pleasure

raises it and aims at FLASH'S heart. Suddenly a SHADOW covers

BARIN. He jerks his head up to SEE:

A WINGED SILHOUETTE

Diving from the sun at him. It is a HAWKMAN, magnificiently

fierce. It seizes BARIN in its talons and lifts him INTO THE

AIR.

Hover, their wings beating the air. They dive on FLASH and

TIGER MAN, lift them too.

EXT. SKY - AURA'S SPACECRAFT

Ascending with their three captives-

INT. COCKPIT -AURA

Put the binoculars down, with one hand lowers the THOUGHT

TRANSFER hood over her head, with the other waves the craft

switches and eyes displays.

Sudden BLINDING BLUE LIGHT explodes within the capsule.

EXT. CAPSULE - ZARKOV AND DALE - CONTINUOUS

(DALE, ZARKOV)

Come diving out headlong into the grass.

ZARKOV stops abruptly, looking down at himself. DALE gasps.

It is true: ZARKOV has no hands.

INVISIBLE HANDS pick up a pebble from the ground, hold it

before DALE'S nose. Magically, they toss the little object

back and forth from one UNSEEN HAND to the other. DALE touches

one, can feel it.

He breaks off again. Slowly, in front of our eyes, ZARKOV'S

HANDS are FADING IN, again and becoming VISIBLE. DALE whistles

in amazement.

SHADOW over them suddenly. Great WHIRRING of wings. DALE

Looks up and SCREAMS.

Swoop down on ZARKOV and DALE, bear them aloft as they did

with FLASH AND TIGER MAN.

INT. MING'S DOME ROOM

(KLYTUS, MING)

In his wonderous DOME ROOM, watching something. PULL BACK.

KLYTUS is beside him as usual. ANGLE to include the VIEWING

SCREEN which MING is watching. On it is a directional

continuation of the scene we just saw: a struggling DALE

being Carrie dup into the open sky by HAWKMEN.

KLYTUS smiles that sinister way. MING looks at him

questioningly.

EXT. SKY - WIDE SHOT

(HAWKMAN, TIGER MAN)

Serried squadrons of HAWKMEN escort the ones bearing FLASH,

BARIN and TIGER MAN through space.

CLOSER - TIGER MAN

Struggling against the TWO HAWKMEN who have him, snarling

and roaring. He butts one in the belly with his horn.

SKY - WIDE PANORAMA

Light streams rough tremendous El Greco clouds. HAWKMEN Are

tiny figures, rising against it.

Higher, higher. Above the clouds a blinding DAZZLE comes

INTO FRAME. It resolves into a fantastic SKY PALACE hanging

in mid-air, reflecting sunlight from myriad turrets and

terraces. The HAWKMEN climb above it.

Carrying FLASH and BARIN and TIGER MAN , going into a

screaming dive.

EXT. SKY PALACE - HAWKMEN POV

Rushing at us with horrifying speed. ZOOMING DOWN we see a

dark opening. The wind howling around wings, we rush dizzingly

into the aperture.

EXT. SKY PALACE - VULTAN'S EYRIE - A HIGH TERRACE

VULTAN circles admiringly around DALE. VULTAN is a lusty

viking of the sky, winged like his men, one eye blinded, his

beard cloven by an old scar from forehead to jaw. Gorgeous

HAWKGIRLS watch jealously as VULTAN inspects DALE very

closely, reaches out a sly hand and touches her bosom. DALE

slaps his hand away.

VULTAN hoots at that as HAWKGIRLS murmur. He's about to

touch her again when there is a CLAMOR o.s. VULTAN reacts.

EXT. SKY PALACE - ANOTHER LEVEL

(BARIN, DALE, FLASH, SARIN, VULTAN, ZARKOV, ZAAKOV)

HAWKMEN carrying FLASH, TIGER MAN and BARIN swoop OUT from

another hole like the one they dove into. The whole place is

like a great hanging birdhouse, HAWKWOMEN and HAWCHILDREN

moving in and out and perching on the various exterior

terraces.

FLASH and TIGER MAN

Are dropped on to a terrace, so hard it stuns them.

Is lowered more carefully on another terrace, this one

grander, with a throne in the center.

Flying down from above, hovering above BARIN with menacing

glee.

FLASH on the OTHER TERRACE

Lifts his head groggily, reacts to something. ANGLE TO

INCLUDE ZARKOV, stumbling out from an opening in his usual

clothes.

Sudden ear-piercing SCREAM from above. DALE'S scream, FLASH

bounds to his feet.

IN THE EYRIE

DALE is surrounded by jealous HAWKGIRLS who are pushing her

toward the terrace edge. Screaming again, DALE goes OVER.

SPACE BETWEEN TWO TERRACES/ ONE TERRACE

FLASH wheels toward the sound, dives to the parapet and

catches DALE as she plunges past.

He hauls her in and they embrace in a steamy kiss. FLUTTER

of wings. HAWKMEN swoop at the terrace and LIFT UP the

clinging couple. It barely interrupts their conversation:

EXT. VULTAN'S TERRACE

(BARIN, DALE, FLASH, HAWKPEOPLE, TIGER MAN, VULTAN)

As FLASH and DALE are lowered on it.

ANOTHER TERRACE - TIGER MAN

On his feet on the other terrace, shouting across:

eyes on FLASH.

QUICK CUTS - HAWKPEOPLE

CHEERING AND SHOUTING eagerly from all around:

INT. SKY PALACE - A RAMP

(DALE, FLASH, ZARKOV)

VULTAN leads the way down. FLASH, BARIN, DALE, ZAAKOV and

TIGER MAN are escorted by many fierce HAWKMEN.

FLASH squeezes DALE'S hand.

Ahead appears an archway opening to the sky. A GREAT GONG

is heard.

ANGLE - HAWKMAN appears with a mallet, he beats again on a

huge bronze GONG.

EXT. SKY PALACE - WIDE SHOT

Startling sight: A big DISC hangs in the air between the

curved prongs of a lower terrace, the shaft that supports it

lost in clouds below.

EXT. A LOWER PLATFORM

FLASH and the OTHERS appear. They halt, looking at the disc.

ONT HE DISC - A HAWKMAN

Is GREASING the shiny surface with a mop, slipping around a

bit as he does so.

SHOTS - ASH AND BARIN getting prepared. Removing shirts being

equipped with heavy leather gauntlets, and so on. Each is

given a long vicious WHIP.

THE LOWER PLATFORM

ANGLE - a bridge-like plank extends itself, out over the

edge of the shiny greased disc. FLASH and BARIN appear, ready

for combat. HAWKMEN behind them, wthey start out over the

bridge.

CU - FLASH

Stopping short, eyes popping, as he SEES:

ON THE DISC

Razor sharp knives are POPPING UP from the top surface all

over, maybe two feet apart. If a man loses his footing and

falls he will surely be fatally impaled.

INT. LOWER PLATFORM

(BARIN, DALE, FLASH, MING'S VOICE, VULTAN, ZARKOV)

FEATURE FLASH and BARIN with whips in hand, they step from

the bridge onto the disc. FLASH almost slips and falls

immediately.

QUICK CU - DALE

CU - FLASH

Getting his balance again. BARIN moves across amidst the

knives, takes a stance facing FLASH, raises and coils back

his whip.

ZWIPPP! BARIN'S whip lashes out savagely at FLASH.

ANGLES - FLASH AND BARIN - SPECTATOR REACTIONS

Suddenly the fight begins. FLASH and BARIN stalk around,

slipping on the grease, whamming at each other with their

whips. The disc suddenly begins to TILT and SWAY, making

this affair even more desperate.

BARIN begins to get an edge. Slashing, cutting, he drives

FLASH back.

Adrenaline courses through his veins as he hears that over

the uproar.

He flies at BARIN, dodges the lash, grapples with him hand-

to-hand.

They wrestle their way tot he very rim of the swaying tilting

surface. It looks bad again for FLASH, when with a superhuman

effort he flips BARIN over his back... over the edge!

In the same instant, FLASH dives onto his side amidst the

deadly knives and grabs at BARIN'S wrist.

FLASH catches him. BARIN hangs suspended over the abyss of

space held only by FLASH'S grip.

Suddenly an ECHOING VOICE BOOMS from the sky:

INT. MING'S DOME

(AURA, MING, MING'S VOICE, VULTAN, ZARKOV)

Where MING watches the SKY PALACE SCENE on a viewing screen,

a weeping AURA beside him, as he goes on:

As the VOICE goes on:

The ECHO rolls and dies.

TIGER MAN suddenly leaps out onto the disc, slides over

between the knives, helps FLASH pull BARIN up to safety.

ZARKOV in his chains, walks over to the confused VULTAN...

VULTAN looks down at FLASH once more, then makes up his mind.

He shouts to his people:

ZARKOV grins, extends a hand to VULTAN. He just looks at

it.

INT. MING'S DOME

(AURA, MING)

MING snaps off the viewing screen, looks at AURA

AURA tries to throw herself into his arm, but he pushes her

roughly away.

KLYTUS materialises from a shadow, smiling.

EXT. SKY PALACE - LONG SHOT

It is being evacuated. Squadrons of HAWAKPEOPLE stream out

of its many openings, diminutive figures against the sky.

ANOTHER PART OF THE SKY

Several ROCKET-SHIPS appear, wonderfully gaudy contraptions

with MING's battle-flags flying. A RAY shoots out from the

nose of the biggest.

EXT. SKY PALACE - LONG SHOT

The RAY zaps it. The whole place EXPLODES.

EXT. SQUADRON OF HAWKMEN - IN FLIGHT

(DALE, FLASH, VULTAN, ZARKOV)

VULTAN and his CAPTAIN lead. Ranged around are BARIN, FLASH,

DALE ,TIGER MAN and ZARKOV, each carried by a HAWKMAN. Distant

explosions rumble like thunder.

The CAPTAIN and a FEW HAWKMEN peel off.

FLASH and DALE

Gaze at each other lovingly, flown along about a hundred

feet apart. He calls for her:

Dark SHADOW falls over DALE. She looks up.

ANOTHER ANGLE IN THE SKY

A big ROCKET SHIP hovers, doors in its bottom side opening.

A flickering RAY shoots down.

BACK TO THE HAWKMEN AND OTHERS IN SKY

As an effulgent GLOW envelopes her. Inexorably, DALE and

her HAWKMEN are sucked upward.

VULTAN's command of course takes precedence. The HAWKMAN

bearing FLASH follows his mates into a shrieking vertical.

dive.

INT. ROCKET SHIP

(DALE, HEDONIA)

DALE and her HAWKMAN are sucked up into a chamber. Waiting

SOLDIERS seize the struggling HAWKMAN, brutally smash his

wings pitch him OUT the bottom as the doors close.

DALE backs off, drops into a karate stance, With a WHINING

ROAR the craft accelerates throwing DALE off balance against

a wall. HEDONIA enters through a door, her arms full seems

to be yards and yards of filmy white material. HEDONIA Smiles

nicely.

EXT. ARBORIA - VINCINITY OF LODGE

TREE MEN and LION MEN and TIGER MAN toil together in peaceful

concernt, constructing a crude wooden launch-gantry around

ZARKOV'S SPACE CAPSULE, which has been conveyed here.

Several hovering HAWKMEN hold it in position with vine cables

as the work is completed. Capsule door is open. Through it

we see ZARKOV at work inside, feverishly re-wiring a control

panel.

EXT. LODGE BALCONY

(BARIN, FLASH, VULTAN, ZARKOV'S VOICE)

Up on Lodge Balcony, FLASH, BARIN and VULTAN lean over a

table on which maps and drawings are laid out, a typical

military staff meeting. With a bit of charcoal, BARIN sketches

a semi-circular line over a map of MING'S city.

VULTAN ascends into the air. Hovers as he goes on:

VULTAN hesitates a moment, the soars away with determination.

INT. CAPSULE

ZARKOV jumps out, leaving the door open. He crouches low.

BARIN and VULTAN and EVERYBODY are watching.

Interior of the capsule is filled with BLINDING BLUE LIGHT

for an instant. ZARKOV pops up, sticks his head in.

As INVISIBLE HANDS turn around the helmet on his head.

BACK TO MAIN SCENE - EXT. CAPSULE

ZARKOV moves inside.

It's true. FLASH is totally invisible, but on the ground we

SEE his shadow as he climbs out and stands upright.

Suddenly there is rising WHINING HUMMING SOUND that seems to

fill the whole firmament. The earth trembles. LION MEN and

TREE MEN cower in terror. TIGER MAN roars.

The SOUND grows louder, intolerable. Brown smoking foliage

rains down. EVERYONE looks up.

EXT. FOREST OF ARBORIA

CUTS AND ANGLES - UPWARDS

The topless forest of Arboria is withering, falling apart.

TREE MEN cry with primal fear as the SEE the sky revealed.

Hovering against the sun are the dark shapes of MING'S ROCKET

SHIPS. PULSING RAYS emanate from projectors on their bottoms.

A VOICE booms from heave:

EVERYONE stands frozen.

PART OF FOREST - CUTAWAY

ONE LION MAN

Howls in terror, makes a break for cover. A RAY instantly

zaps down at him and he EXPLODES into fiery fragments.

BACK TO MAIN PART OF FOREST

A small SHUTTLE CRAFT descends vertically to a soft landing.

KLYTUS gets out. Every sound ceases. He nods at BARIN, at

ZARKOV. Looks around. Frowns. He walks directly across

FLASH'S SHADOW, to ZARKOV.

INT. MING'S SERAGLIO

(AURA, DALE)

DALE shuts her eyes, sobs out:

Tear runs down AURA'S cheeks. She seizes DALE'S hand, presses

it against her wonderful breast. DALE is really moved.

DALE embraces AURA. They cling to each other, bosom against

bosom, in perfect womanly understanding. Golden CHORDS are

heard. Doors open. AMAZONS enter.

EXT. ARBORIA - ZARKOV'S CAPSULE

Capsule sits in its launch-gantry, amidst the ruined blight

left by the ray attack. There is not a soul in sight. Then

Flash's SHADOW moves quickly over the ground toward the

Capsule and VANISHES into the hatch. The door shuts itself.

INT. CAPSULE

Control levers move. A red button depresses itself. Through

the side, which we should remember is transparent from within,

we SEE the scene outside going into a GREEN-BROWN BLUR as

the capsule starts to spin for takeoff.

INT. MING'S BEDCHAMBER

(KLYTUS, MING)

MING is being robed by TWO GIRL ATTENDANTS. Suddenly KLYTUS

is there in a shadow, smiling. MING senses him, turns.

KLYTUS is swallowed again in shadow.

EXT. ZARKOV'S CAPSULE - IN FLIGHT

Sailing over the ever frozen Moon of FRIGIA

INT. MING'S DOME

(CAPTIN, MING)

Capsule is SEEN on the viewing screen, grid-lines dancing

over the image as FRIGORIA is left behind. Watching are MING,

KLYTUS, the CAPTAIN and several other SOLDIERS.

INT. ZARKOV'S CAPSULE - IN FLIGHT

Through the front we see MING'S CITY dead ahead and below.

Numbers flash on the navigation display, constantly changing.

INVISIBLE HAND picks up a microphone, holds it before

INVISIBLE LIPS.

EXT. ARBORIA - IN A BROWN BLASTED TREE

(FLASH'S VOICE, VULTAN)

VULTAN and some other HAWKMEN perch, listening to VOICE coming

from a radio in VULTAN'S belt.

VULTAN doesn't stir a feather. After a moment:

CAPSULE AND TREE IN ARBORIA

The microphone hangs itself up on the panel.

VULTAN AND HIS HAWKMEN

Just sit there, grim-faced. VULTAN shake his head.

EXT. PALACE BATTLEMENTS

(GUARD CAPTAIN, KLYTUS)

It's an armed camp. SOLDIERS stand admits tanks and ray-gun

artillery, every weapon trained on a landing pad in the

middle.

KLYTUS waits with his CAPTAIN watching the mirror-bright

capsule coming down.

It lands. CAPTAIN gives a signal.

ZAP! From a tank's ray gun.

The capsule's door is knocked with surgical precision off

its hinges. Flanked by SOLDIERS with ray-guns at the ready,

the CAPTAIN advances and looks in. He turns and calls back

to KLYTUS in surprise.

KLYTUS frowns. He doesn't notice the SHADOW that suddenly

passes over him, moves on quickly.

Halts, shift shape as FLASH stops in dismay at that, turns.

A RAY GUN - ON A TANK ZAPS out a ray.

ZARKOV'S CAPSULE - glows white, falls into thin ashes.

Lets out a bitter sigh. Then the SHADOW moves again, fast,

to an open doorway.

INT. PALACE HALLWAY - A SOLDIER

(FLASH' S VOICE, SOLDIER)

Stands on guard. Suddenly out of nowhere, but very close.

WHAM! A left to the gut doubles him over to take an invisible

knockout right on the chin.

INT. UNDER THE PALACE

TWO SOLDIERS stand with ray-guns before a heavy locked door.

Suddenly INVISIBLE FLASH steps behind a flaring torch, casting

an enormous SHADOW on the wall. He manipulates his caped

arms so that the image becomes truly fearsome.

The SOLDIERS faint.

INT. NARROW PASSAGEWAY - UNDER THE PALACE

FOUR SOLDIERS march along, two by two, filling the narrow

way. SOUND OF RUNNING FEET coming towards them. They halt

i n consternation. WHAM! Invisible FLASH crashes into them,

sending them flying like bowling-pins.

INT. DUNGEON AREA

FOUR GUARDS lounge. around. MOVE to one of them, who sits

studying the pictures in the Mingo version of PLAYBOY

magazine. A SHADOW falls over the page.

An INVISIBLE UPPERCUT knocks him off his chair.

ANGLES - THE FIGHT

As INVISIBLE FLASH goes after the other three with a deadly

chair that seems to SWING itself through the air.

INT. DUNGEON

ZARKOV, BARIN and TIGER MAN lie in chains, heads cocked at

SOUNDS of the facas outside. THUD of a body falling, brief

silence, then sound of a KEY IN THE LOCK.

The door opens itself.

INT. NARROW VERTICAL SHAFT

(BARIN, FLASH'S VOICE, ZARKOV)

The Same one AURA and FLASH fell down originally. Now BARIN,

ZARKOV, TIGER MAN and FLASH are inching their way UP it like

mountain climbers doing a rock chimney; in. back-to-back

pairs, feet pressed out against the shaft walls. What makes

it look even stranger, half of the FLASH-BARIN twosome is

INVISIBLE. Low conversation as they pant and struggle up the

INT. PLASMA CAVERN

(CONTROLLER, GUARD CAPTAIN)

LIZARD MEN SLAVES work like mad, shoveling radioactive fuel

into the seething mass.

ON THE MEZZANINE

CONTROLLERS are at consoles. Many GUARDS stand around.

Everyone watches a big hanging dial. Its needle quivers with

each flare-up from the inferno below, inches toward a RED

SECTOR.

CONTROLLER What's the hurry?

CONTROLLERS twist the shock-knobs.

Tortured SLAVES howl in agony. Some drop and are thrown into

the fiery mass, others redouble their efforts.

ON THE MEZZANINE

The needle quivers upwards. MOVE OFF it to a slot-like window

in back wall. There are EYES behind the glass.

INT. CRAWLSPACE BEHIND THE MEZZANINE

(BARIN, FLASH'S VOICE, TIGER MAN, ZARKOV)

ZARKOV,BARIN and TIGER MAN crouch amidst WHIRRING ventilators,

watching through the window.

ZARKOV and BARIN just look at him. TIGER MAN slumps out of

his fighting stance.

Low door at the back opens itself and INVISIBLE FLASH comes

in.

Hope drains from his expression.

EXT. SKY - WIDE ANGLE

(HAWKMAN CAPTAIN, VULTAN)

It is filled with HAWKMEN, flying toward us.

VULTAN and HIS CAPTAIN. fly in the lead, looking ahead and

down at the City of Mingo.

VULTAN soars up and hovers, shouts to the ranks behind:

Keep flying right on, not one bird of them turning back.

Musing to his captain:

INT. MING'S DOME - ON VIEWING SCREEN

THREE HAWKMEN are SEEN in steep descent. comes ,INTO FOCUS

over them.

PULL BACK. Several OFFICERS and SOLDIERS are around a console,

watching the screen and other displays.

Another OFFICER touches a red firing-button.

EXT. PALACE BATTLEMENTS

Ranged here are devices like multiple rocket-launchers,

bristling with hundreds of arrows. SWOOSH: One fires its

load into the sky.

EXT. SKY - HAWKMEN

(HAWKMAN CAPTAIN, VULTAN)

The THREE LEADING HAWKMEN are impaled a dozen times each

crumple and plummet down.

VULTAN and CAPTAIN - HOVERING

EXT. BATTLEMENTS/SKY

INTERCUTS - HAWKMEN and ARROW PROJECTORS

as the brave HAWKMEN dive in a converging stream at the

invisible opening, and the projectors FIRE again and again.

Great slaughter is wreaked on the HAWKMEN, but they keep

coming.

One group VEERS to the side away from the deadly fire, only

to crash into the equally deadly force-field. They EXPLODE

into flames.

INT. DOME

FIRING OFFICER is almost breaking his thumb, he has it jammed

down so hard on the red button.

ANGLE to the VIEWING SCREEN. On it VULTAN leads a stream of

descending HAWKMEN.

EXT. SKY - HAWKMEN

Circle and reform, some giving mid-air aid to wounded mates,

and on they come, onward!

INT. DOME

EXT. PALACE BATTLEMENTS

HAWKMEN descend as SOLDIERS rush out at them. The battle is

epic, a crazy combination of swords and ray-guns and clubs

and spears.

VULTAN is a towering figure in the middle of it, dealing

havoc on all sides.

As he fights THREE SOLDIERS, ANOTHER races at VULTAN'S back

with a deadly spear. Suddenly he TRIPS OVER NOTHING and

crashes headlong to be dispatched by another HAWKMAN. VULTAN

whirls and is amazed to have his freehand warmly clasped by

an INVISIBLE ONE.

INT. A PALACE ANTECHAMBER

(KLYTUS, MING, OFFICER)

MING and KLYTUS, in ceremonial robes. As part of his costume

MING wears a sword.

Door flies open, an OFFICER dashes in.

EXT. BATTLEMENTS

(FLASH'S VOICE, HAWKMAN CAPTAIN, VULTAN)

The battle continues. Bloodies HAWKMAN CAPTAIN fights his

way up beside VULTAN, who is engaged in seizing a dominant

piece of ray-gun artillery.

Suddenly MUSIC is heard from below. Some great electronic

organ booms out the strains of what is recognizably "Here

Come The Bride".... the familiar thrilling wedding-march.

INT. MING'S GREAT HALL - HIGH WIDE ANGLE

A magnificent wedding is on. DALE marches slowly up the

middle, on KLYTUS'S arm, helped along by AMAZONS who march

at her back with spears. Her long train passes between the

AMAZONS to be borne behind by LOVELY GIRLS, as the party

passes between ranks of splendidly garbed MONGONS.

An aged HIGH PRIEST waits at the throne-altar with MING,

whose eyes lecherously devour his approaching bride.

CLOSE ON DALE

Her beauty only enhanced by the teas rolling soundlessly

down her cheeks.

INT. PLASMA CAVERN

The molten mass is more intense than we have ever seen it,

scarcely bearable to the eye.

INT. CRAWLSPACE BEHIND THE MEZZANINE

(TIGER MAN, ZARKOV)

Even in here there is a terrible glare from the slot-window,

ZARKOV turns his face away suddenly, infinitely sad.

INT. CAVERN - POV SHOT

VULTAN and THREE HAWKMEN are swooping down from some gallery

above. VULTAN and TWO pounce on CONTROLLERS, while the THIRD

HAWKMAN flies down to open a door on the lower level.

INT. CRAWLSPACE

ZARKOV and BARIN and TIGER MAN

Scramble for the low exit behind them.

INT. MING'S GREAT HALL

(DALE, FLASH'S VOICE, HIGH PRIEST, MING)

Earth turns slowly in mid-air, its seas and continents veiled

by clouds of hideous smoke which seethe with flashes of

interior red lightning.

Then FACES come INTO FOCUS below and behind it, and we realise

we are in MING' S GREAT HALL, where EARTH is a holographic

image in a transparent box above the altar-throne.

Standing beside MING at the altar with KLYTUS, looking up

despairingly at her beloved planet while the HIGH PRIEST

KLYTUS produces a golden ring, hands it to MING.

MING takes DALE'S left hand, forces it up into position,

holds the ring poised to slip it on. MING'S face has never

been more merciless.

An INVISIBLE HAND snatches the ring from MING'S grip like

lightning and james it onto DALE'S finger.

Pandemonium. DALE runs like hell, but is tripped by her train

and goes down as MING leaps up onto his throne platform.

ANGLE - A PORTAL

Swinging shut, BARIN squeezing in through it at the last

instant, sword in hand. KLYTUS rushes at him with a sword of

his own.

Looks around wildly, whipping out the sword sheathed at his

belt. Its blade is like crystal fire. He reacts sharply,

catches his breath.

WHAT MING SEES - ANOTHER SWORD

(FLASH'S VOICE, MING)

exactly like his, a blade of fire, apparently hanging in the

air and pointed right at him.

The sword slowly advances.

His face contorted, he flies at INVISIBLE FLASH behind the

sword. FLASH parries the blow. Astonishing pyrotechnics as

the blades hit each other. Shrieking MONGONS flee under

showers of fire.

INT. PLASMA CAVERN

HAWKMEN and LIZARD MEN SLAVES engage MING'S PEOPLE.

Aided by VULTAN and TIGER MAN, ZARKOV battles his way up to

the Mezzanine Control area. He shouts down wildly:

INT. GREAT HALL

(BARIN, DALE, KLYTUS)

MING and FLASH

Duel dazzlingly around the enormous throne. Suddenly FLASH

starts to lose his invisibility. A pair of eyes appears,

the tip of a nose, parts of limbs.

Pinned by AMAZONS, reacting to that.

FLASH and MING

FLASH pauses to look at himself, almost gets his head lopped

off by a fiery slash from MING, recovers to bound up higher

on the vast throne statue wheron they battle.

PULL UP. In the f.g. the image of EARTH slowly turns and

glows redder with the lightning inside the clouds.

BARIN and KLYTUS

Duel in another area of e Hall. A thrust by BARIN catches

KLYTUS on the forehead. KLYTUS springs back, blood gushing

down over his eyes.

KLYTUS laughs, reaches up and throws off his helmet, WHIRLS

in a lightning way to reveal

Shadowed, hideous, marked with all the evil in the universe.

It's mouth emits a raging SCREAM.

Lunges with horror, slashes with his sword point.

Is slashed but grotesquely does not bleed.

BARIN and KLYTUS

Fly at each other again, trade blows, then each catches a

wrist of the other with his free hand. KLYTUS laughs

horribly.

KLYTUS twists away, knocks BARIN'S sword out of his grasp,

drives BARIN back against the wall. KLYTUS lifts his own

sword, puts it at BARIN'S throat for the final thrust.

Suddenly changes horribly. PULL BACK. AURA is behind him,

her hand on the hilt of BARIN'S sword, which she has driven

into KLYTUS' back. Soundless, dead, KLYTUS falls to the floor.

AURA and BARIN

Move together, embrace. BARIN touches her face. Gently, AURA

strokes BARIN'S cheek in hirst human-like, loving touch.

FLASH and MING

Have duelled their way right up onto the shoulder of the

great statue now, fight against a vast replica of MING'S

EAR.

INT. PLASMA CAVERN

Needle trembles on the verge of red.

ANGLE DOWN to ZARKOV at console, protected against the final

GUARDS' onslaught by VULTAN and TIGER MAN as he works

feverishly with a screwdriver on a wiring panel pulled out

from the innards He straightens up, takes a deep breath.

ZARKOV hits a switch.

INT. GREAT HALL

(ALL THE MONGONS, DALE, DALE'S VOICE)

Reacting to something, pointing upward:

EARTH - THE IMAGE IN THE AIR

As he swivels his head for a quick look. He freezes, gives

a CRY of unmitigated rage. FLASH seizes the instant, thrust

his sword.

The blade goes into MING up to the hilt. FLASH pulls it

out.

There isn't a drop of blood. MING just stands there , smoking,

in spectacular fashion into the atoms of which he was

constituted. MING is just GONE.

HIGH SHOT - THE GREAT HALL

EVERYONE looks upwards at FLASH, standing with his sword

atop the statue. There is a clatter as AMAZONS cast away

their spears. A cry goes up as if from one throat!

EXT. SKY OVER MINGO

Vista of stunning beauty as HAWKMEN soar and loop in wondrous

victory rolls, leaving behind RAINBOW CONTRAILS.

EXT. PALACE BATTLEMENTS

(DALE, FLASH, ZARKOV)

It is a scene of peace now. HAWKMEN and SOLDIERS join in

tending their wounded. Formerly fierce AMAZONS act as gentle

nurses. MOVE OVER this to find FLASH, DALE and ZARKOV standing

together, looking up at the terrific sky-shadow, FLASH with

an arm around DALE'S shoulder. He glances at her tenderly,

is surprised to see tears on her cheeks.

DALE laughs, turns her face up to FLASH. He kisses her. As

they head into the Palace, ZARKOV gazes upward again.

EXT. SKY

HAWKMEN swoop and soar, weaving RAINBOWS, as END CREDITS

ROLL.
