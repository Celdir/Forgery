FADE IN:

EXT. DESERT OF THE AMERICAN SOUTHWEST - DAY

A mountain peak dominates the landscape.

TITLES BEGIN.

Riders on horseback cross the desert. From this distance they appear to be a

company of Army Cavalry Soldiers.

CLOSER ANGLES ON THE RIDERS

reveal only details of saddles, hooves and uniforms. The riders are silhouetted

against the rising sun as they ride into an ancient CLIFF PUEBLO.

The OFFICER IN COMMAND raises his hand halting his troops.

RIDERS climb down from their mounts... and only now do we realize that

this is a TROOP OF BOY SCOUTS, all of them about thirteen years of age. The

"Commanding Officer" is only their SCOUTMASTER, Mr. Havelock.

One of the Scouts, a pudgy kid named HERMAN, steps away from his horse,

bends over and pukes. The other Scouts rag on him.

A BLOND SCOUT, however, befriends Herman. He has a thatch of straw-colored

hair and the no-nonsense expression common to kids whose curiosity and appetite

for knowledge exceed what they teach in school. Additionally, he has adorned his

uniform with an authentic HOPI INDIAN WOVEN BELT.

Two Boy Scouts climb up the rocky base of the cliff.

INT. THE PASSAGEWAY - DAY

The two boys head down the passageway. It's dark, and the temperature drops

several degrees. Spiders have built huge webs that get caught in the boys' hair.

HERMAN appears very uncertain as to the wisdom of this enterprise, but he's

drawn on by his companion's adventurous curiosity.

LAUGHTER is HEARD; the Blond Scout pulls Herman forward toward its source.

The VOICES GROW LOUDER now as the boys get closer to their source. The light

of kerosene lanterns dances on the tunnel walls ahead. The boys approach

cautiously, careful to stay hidden.

This is what they see:

FOUR MEN digging with shovels and pick-axes. They have broken into one of the

pueblo's SECRET CHAMBERS... called "Kivas."

The men are ROUGH RIDER (his name describes his dress), ROSCOE (a Bowery

Boy bully of 14) and HALFBREED (with straight black hair that cascades over his

shoulders).

And the fourth man wears a LEATHER WAIST JACKET and BROWN FELT

FEDORA HAT. He has his back turned to us, but we would be willing to bet

anything that this is INDLANA JONES.

However, when the man turns, and his face is illuminated by the lantern's glow,

we are shocked to discover that it is someone else.

We'll call him FEDORA.

The TWO BOYS are mesmerized by what they see.

Now we realize that the Blond Scout is actually young INDIANA JONES.

Two of the men stand and look at ROSCOE who steps forward holding a box in his

hands.

Whoops from the other men.

ROSCOE rushes forward and gives FEDORA the box. Fedora steps toward a

lantern resting on a rock.

More whoops from the other men.

FEDORA puts the box on the rock next to the lantern. HALFBREED pushes

ROSCOE as he jumps with excitement. ROUGH RIDER steps forward to look at the

box as Fedora opens it.

FEDORA takes a BEJEWELED CROSS from the box and holds it aloft. Fedora's

comrades practically salivate at the sight of it.

INDY takes off his hat and looks down at the o.s. action.

FEDORA blows dust from the Cross, turning it in his hand, silently appraising its

beauty... and its value. He seems aloof from the others; somehow superior to

them.

INDY stays hidden, but is astounded by what he sees.

FEDORA continues to admire the Cross, then places it on the rock next to its box

and the lantern.

INDY turns back to observe the men.

A look of resolve comes into INDY's expression, and he turns back toward

HERMAN.

HERMAN doesn't seem to be listening. Instead, he watches in wide-eyed horror

as a SNAKE SLITHERS ACROSS HIS LAP.

INDY matter-of-factly picks up the snake and tosses it aside. HERMAN gasps.

INDY grabs HERMAN's scout scarf and pulls him closer.

INDY releases the scarf, gives HERMAN a pat and Herman dashes off. Indy sees

the Cross on the rock next to the lantern. As the Robbers continue to search for

additional valuables, Indy is able to work his way unseen to within arm's reach of

the Cross...

FEDORA looks over at the men digging in a hole b.g.

INDY picks up the Cross.

As FEDORA stands watching the other men digging, INDY puts the Cross in his

pants and begins to pull himself up a rope hanging nearby. As he climbs, Indy's

feet break a wooden beam, attracting the men's attention.

The three Robbers are so eager to get their hands on INDY, they almost knock

each other over in the attempt.

Only FEDORA is unperturbed. He casts a disgusted glance in

the direction of his fleeing companionsthen sets off

after INDY.

EXT. THE  CLIFFS - DAY

INDY EMERGES from the darkness of the Pueblo into the brightness of day.

He pausessquintsshields his eyeslooks in all directions.

He hears RUNNING FOOTSTEPS BEHIND HIM and dashes off. ROUGH RIDER,

HALFBREED, and ROSCOE are quick to appear and run after him.

Indy jumps from one rock to another; the SCOUT TROOP HORSES are below. Indy

puts two fingers in his mouth and WHISTLES for his horse, who trots over. Indy

puts the Cross in his belt.

INDY PREPARES TO JUMP into the saddle. Hesitates. Then... he JUMPS. But

the horse moves exactly at the wrong moment and Indy lands flat on his feet in a

standing position. The impact sends a shock wave up his body that rattles his

back teeth. Indy stands up and successfully mounts his horse.

FEDORA AND HIS MEN ARRIVE at the roof's edge in time to see INDY climb into

the saddle and gallop off.

FEDORA puts two fingers in his mouth and WHISTLES... and A VINTAGE TRUCK

AND AUTOMOBILE come ROARING OUT from behind the Pueblo (Driven by two

more gang members). Now we glimpse...

THE MAN IN THE PANAMA HAT

The passenger in the car. His face is concealed by the hat's wide brim. His arm

is out the window, however, and we see an olive-colored hand protruding from

the sleeve of an expensive white linen suit. He gestures to the Robbers, now in

the truck.

INDY SPURS his mount on to greater speeds but the autos not only keep pace

with his horse... they begin to squeeze in on it.

Speeding Autos. Thundering hooves. Rushing wind. Flying dust. INDY crouched

low and leaning forward in the saddle, his heart pounding, his adrenalin

pumping.

INDY VEERS OFF in a new directiontoward a RAILROAD TRACK.

EXT. A CIRCUS TRAIN - DAY

The train is barreling down the track. INDY rides up beside it. He glances over

his shoulder and sees the car and truck gaining on him. No other choice... he

LEAPS FROM HORSE TO TRAIN.

He clings to the side of a BOXCAR, as HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER leap from

the truck onto the train.

HALFBREED tries to grab INDY, but Indy leaps onto another boxcar. Halfbreed

runs after him but Indy leaps from the boxcar onto some covered boxes stacked

on a flatcar.

INDY loses his balance but regains it. With HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER still

running after him, Indy enters the trap door of...

INT. THE REPTILE CAR - DAY

and finds himself CRAWLING on a CATWALK suspended from the car's ceiling.

Several feet below are NUMEROUS VATS containing all manner of reptiles:

Alligators, crocodiles, giant lizards, etc.

Then, HALFBREED ENTERS through the trap doorfollowed by ROUGH RIDER.

Halfbreed grabs hold of INDY's feet, but Indy kicks at him and he loses his grasp.

INDY crawls away, toward an opening on the opposite side. HALFBREED grabs at

Indy's feet again; Indy rolls away and we SEE large bins of squirming snakes.

The combined weight of the three people is more than the catwalk was intended

for, and the BOLTS BEGIN TO RIP FROM THE CEILING.

Everyone holds their breath, afraid to make another move. Too late. SEVERAL

BOLTS TEAR FREE. HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER SCREAM... but it's Indy's

end of the catwalk that DROPS DOWN... PLUNGING INDY to the floor of the car.

He lands hard, with a SPLASH into a vat of water... where he finds himself eye-

to-eye with an

ENORMOUS ANACONDA

The head of this snake is so damn big, it looks more like a Tyrannosaurus Rex.

INDY jumps back in horror... only to land with a SQUISH into the SNAKE VAT.

Hundreds of slippery, squirming snakes. INDY sinks into them. They cover him.

Engulf him. Almost smother him.

INDY jumps out of the side of the vat, freeing himself.

INDY locates a clean-out door at the bottom of the car and uses it to escape.

HALFBREED, meanwhile, tries to open the closed window of the car. He groans.

ROUGH RIDER moves to assist him.

EXT. THE TRAIN- DAY

INDY stops, checks to see the Cross still lodged in his belt. Suddenly he looks

worried as he frantically reaches into his shirt, REMOVES A SNAKE FROM and

tosses it away.

ROSCOE APPEARS atop the reptile car and manages to grab INDY. Indy kicks at

him. Roscoe grabs onto the side of the reptile car as Indy moves on to...

EXT. A FLATCAR - DAY

INDY climbs over canvas-covered circus equipment. ROSCOE follows, grabbing a

long stick with a hook on it. He reaches forward and trips Indy, who falls onto

the roof of the rhino boxcar.

INT. THE RHINO BOXCAR - DAY

as a lamp falls from the ceiling with the impact of Indy's fall, hitting a HUGE

BLACK RHINOCEROS.

EXT. THE RHINO BOXCAR - DAY

ROSCOE grabs INDY by the ankle and yanks him off his feet. The two struggle,

rolling from side to side, coming perilously close to rolling right off the edge.

Things get even more serious when Roscoe PULLS A KNIFE.

IN THE BOXCAR BELOW

... THE FEROCIOUS BLACK RHINO is becoming extremely agitated by the

commotion going on atop his cage. Finally, he raises his head and THRUSTS HIS

HORN THROUGH THE ROOF.

BACK TO THE ROOFTOP

as the horn SMASHES through the wood only inches from INDY's head. Indy and

Roscoe stare at the horn in amazement as they continue to struggle.

SMASH! The horn comes up againRIGHT BETWEEN INDY'S LEGS.

INDY kicks ROSCOE away. Roscoe rolls to the edge of the car but keeps from

falling. Indy flips over onto his stomach.

EXT. THE REPTILE CAR - DAY

The WOODEN TRAP DOOR EXPLODES as a BULLET is FIRED from within. The

door is pushed open and HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER hurry out of the car.

EXT. THE RHINO BOXCAR - DAY

INDY gets to his feetlooks aheadsees a WATER TANK alongside the track

directly up ahead. Indy gets an idea...

In an instant, he calculates his approachtimes the distanceand LEAPS for

the tank's WATER SPOUT.

He catches it perfectly... but his velocity causes the water spout to ROTATE A

FULL 360 DEGREES. With INDY hanging on, feet kicking, the water spout

deposits him back on the train, onto the ROOF OF A STOCKCAR, where he looks

up to see FEDORA walking toward him.

As INDY edges away from FEDORA, a portion of the STOCKCAR'S ROOF

COLLAPSES and Indy FALLS THROUGH into the car below.

INT. THE STOCKCAR - DAY

INDY CRASHES down from above. Dust rises.

INDY's eyes take a moment to adjust to the dark. A bit of sunlight leaks in

through the cracks between the boards.

Then INDY sees it. At the far end of the boxcar. Rising slowly to its feet... an

AFRICAN LION. The Lion ROARS. The boxcar walls shake. Indy gasps. Dust

swirls up into the shafts of sunlight.

And INDY has one more surprise in store: The Cross of Cortes has been dislodged

from his belt during the fall...

INDY glances around, sees a coiled LION TAMER'S WHIP hanging on a nail. He

carefully takes it down by the handle. The Lion sees this and GROWLS SOFTLY.

INDY swallows hard and gives the whip a try. It unravels awkwardly, its TIP

flying back and HITTING INDY IN THE FACE... CUTTING his chin.

The Lion GROWLS LOUDER. Indy quickly gathers up the whip, wets his lips, and

tries again. This timesuccess! The WHIP CRACKS SHARPLY. The Lion

BELLOWS and SWATS the air... and steps back.

INDY looks amazed and delighted. He CRACKS the whip again. The Lion backs

away even more. Indy inches forwardbends down (never taking his eyes off

the Lion)picks up the Crossand steps back again, sweat pouring down his

face.

But now... how to get out?

He looks up at the opening through which he fell and sees FEDORA LOOKING

DOWN AT HIM. Fedora extends his hand.

EXT. THE ROOFTOP OF STOCKCAR

FEDORA, assisted by HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER, "reels" INDY out of the

Stockcar as the Lion ROARS and lunges and Indy screams.

The men, including ROSCOE, pull INDY through the hole in the roof. He stands to

face them as ROUGH RIDER points a gun in his direction.

ROSCOE makes a grab for the Crossbut INDY doesn't let go. A tug-of-war

ensues until a SNAKE WIGGLES OUT FROM INDY'S SHIRTSLEEVE and WRAPS

AROUND Roscoe's hand.

ROSCOE SCREAMS BLOODY MURDERreleases his grip on the Cross and tries

to shake off the snake. This is all the opportunity Indy needs. He LEAPS ONTO

THE NEXT CAR.

INDY swings down to the caboose. He sees a sign above the caboose door reading

"DR. FANTASY'S MAGIC CABOOSE."

He glances back at the men and quickly opens the door to the caboose, stepping

inside.

FEDORA puts out his arm, gesturing for the others not to follow INDY.

INT. THE CABOOSE - DAY

which contains the circus MAGIC EQUIPMENT. INDY rushes to the rear door of

the caboose but can't open it. He hears FEDORA coming, and dives into a MAGIC

BOX.

FEDORA smiles confidently and advances toward the box. The box unexpectedly

collapses; all four sides flop away... revealing NOTHING. INDY has completely

vanished.

FEDORA is mystified, frustrated and angered. Then he feels a breeze at his back.

He turns and discovers that the caboose door is open. He rushes out onto the

balcony and sees:

INDY RUNNING along the tracks, turning up a street of modest clapboard houses.

EXT. STREET - SMALL TOWN - DAY

as INDY runs from the railroad tracks and approaches his house we see the name

"JONES" painted on the mailbox.

INT. THE HOUSE - DAY

INDY bursts through the front door holding the Cross in his hand. A Husky

BARKS as Indy runs past in search of his father.

INT. THE STUDY - DAY

INDY charges in. The study is cluttered with books. Pictures, charts and maps

clearly reflect the father's passion for Medieval studies.

PROFESSOR HENRY JONES is absorbed at his desk. In fact, he is studying a very

ancient parchment volume which lies open on the desk. The page shows a

beautifully illuminated picture of what might be a stained-glass window. The

sketch incorporates a series of Roman numerals. The Professor is not just

studying it, he is copying it into his own notebook.

No question who is the boss here. INDY gulps, his look says "What am I going to

do with this guy?" And obeys

starts counting, VERY, VERY FAINTLY.

Now we see what HENRY is concentrating on. We see his hand

sketching; then, he holds up one finger.

INDY's reaction:

An ancient car is heard arriving. Perhaps INDY glimpses it going past the

window. Anyway, it stops outside the house. Two men sit in the front seat.

HERMAN sits in the rear, BLOWING A TRUMPET.

INDY's reaction: Trouble!

HENRY is just finishing the sketch.

INT. THE FRONT ROOM - DAY

The study door is just closing, INDY closing it behind him... just as HERMAN

comes through the front door, still playing the trumpet.

INDY reaches for the trumpet, pulling it from HERMAN's mouth. Herman

continues to spitright into Indy's face. Indy flinches.

HERMAN means the SHERIFF, who now enters the house.

INDY shows the CROSS, more or less handing it to the SHERIFF to make his

point. The Sheriff takes it casually.

FEDORA enters the house, followed by ROSCOE, ROUGH RIDER and HALFBREED.

He politely removes his hat and holds it in his hand. He nods at INDY in a

friendly manner.

The SHERIFF and FEDORA are in Cahoots

The SHERIFF hands the Cross to FEDORA. ROSCOE reaches in and takes it from

Fedora, then runs out the door.

As ROSCOE runs outside INDY seesthrough the screen doorthe MAN IN

THE PANAMA HAT waiting patiently beside the car that is parked out front.

Roscoe approaches and gives the Man the Crossthe Man hands Roscoe some

money in exchange.

The SHERIFF tips his hat and leaves.

FEDORA remains behind for a moment. He turns and speaks to INDY in an ironic

man-to-man way.

Then, FEDORA takes off his hat and takes a step towards INDY. He holds the hat

by the crown, and puts it on Indy's head, a show of respect and admiration for

the boy. The hat blocks Indy's face.

CLOSE ON THE TOP OF THE FEDORA HAT

The hat brim fills the screen. As the brim tilts up, WE SEE the face of FULL

GROWN INDIANA JONES.

And... POW!... he's punched in the face while his arms are pinned behind his

back.

FADE IN TITLE: "PORTUGUESE COAST1938"

THE MAN IN THE PANAMA HAT (years older now) removes the CROSS OF

CORONADO from Indy's belt.

THE DECK OF A PORTUGUESE CARGO SHIP

It's NIGHT. RAIN POURS down. We're in the middle of a violent STORM AT SEA.

Thirty-foot waves crash across the deck.

The TWO PORTUGUESE SAILORS (who have Indy's arms pinned behind his back)

propel INDY across the deck toward the rail.

As they pass a BUNDLE OF FUEL DRUMS, INDY uses the Two Sailors as leverage

to KICK UP HIS FEET and break open the CLAMP on the metal bands that hold

the drums together.

INDY jabs his elbows into the stomachs of the startled Sailors and rushes toward

the MAN IN THE PANAMA HAT.

PANAMA HAT sees INDY coming and hurries toward the ladder that leads up to

the bridge. Indy withstands the force of waves crashing on the deck and makes

his way to where Panama Hat is climbing the ladder. He pulls him off the ladder

from behind the two men fall down on the deck. Indy takes the cross back from

Panama Hat.

A sailor delivers a powerful blow to Indy's face, sending the cross flying out of

his grip and skittering across the deck. Indy grabs a crowbar and fends off two

sailors who attack him from the sides.

INDY sees that the Cross is about to be swept overboard. He lunges for it.

He SNATCHES UP the Cross only to be knocked down to the deck by a giant wave.

He struggles to his feet, managing to avoid the giant fuel drums sliding across the

deck around him.

SEVERAL MORE DRUMS come INDY's way. He sidesteps them all.

Indy turns around and pummels two sailors with one punch. Indy sees a large

Stevedore's hook above him and he climbs up on crates to reach it. He grabs a

hold of the hook and uses it to swing all the way across the deck, narrowly

avoiding a huge wave behind him. He jumps into the rollicking ocean, still

holding onto the cross. On the ship, a giant fuel drum rolls wildly, falling directly

onto a crate of TNT. The crate explodes, causing the entire ship to blow, sending

an enormous orange fireball into the sky.

LONG SHOT - THE BOAT EXPLODING OUT OF THE WATER

as bits of debris fall from the sky like rain.

INDY BOBS UP

in the water amid the debris, holding the Cross in his hand. He grabs for

something to keep him afloat. It turns out to be one of the ship's LIFE

PRESERVERS. INDY loops his arm through the preserver.

Only now do we see the FADED LETTERING on the preserver revealing the

destroyed ship's name and city of port:

BARCELONA

A SHREDDED PANAMA HAT floats past.

EXT. COLLEGE - DAY

Students walk along brick, tree-lined paths.

INT. COLLEGE LECTURE HALL - DAY

DISSOLVE TO:

INDY, dressed in professorial tweeds, stands before his class. He turns to the

blackboard with a piece of chalk and writes the word: "FACT."

Laughter.

INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

MARCUS BRODY approaches Indy's classroom. He peers through the window in

the door to see INDY completing his lecture.

INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY

BRODY enters the lecture hall and stands at the rear of the room.

The BELL RINGS. INDY stands at his desk as students begin to disperse. A

pretty coed puts a note on the desk.

BRODY approaches as the last of the students leaves the lecture hall.

INDY removes the cloth-wrapped Cross from his desk. He places it on the desk

and takes off his glasses as BRODY examines the Cross.

INDY gathers up his books and makes his way toward the door.

He turns back toward BRODY, now holding the Cross.

INT. INDY'S OUTER OFFICE - DAY

Bursting with STUDENTS, all competing for his attention at once: "Professor

Jones! " "Doctor Jonesl " etc., etc.

INDY shoulders his way to the desk of his secretary, an overwhelmed Teaching

Assistant named IRENE.

INDY takes the term papers then turns to enter his PRIVATE OFFICE. Students

once again CLAMOR for his attention: "Doctor Jones!" "Wait, Doctor Jonesl"

"My grade!" "Sign my registration card!"

INDY silences the mob with a raised hand.

The Students descend upon poor IRENE, each claiming to be first. INDY slips into

his -

PRIVATE OFFICE

where he goes to his desk and finds a thick envelope with a foreign postmark on it.

Then, INDY stuffs his mail into his coat pockets, goes to the WINDOW, slides it

open and STEPS OUT INTO THE GARDEN.

EXT. SIDE OF COLLEGE BUILDING - DAY

INDY escapes through the garden.

EXT. FRONT OF COLLEGE BUILDING - DAY

INDY walks briskly toward the street; smiling, erUoying his freedom. As he

arrives at the curb, a LONG BLACK PACKARD SEDAN pulls up before him.

THREE MEN step out of the sedan. Everything about them bespeaks "G-MAN."

The First Man steps behind Indy.

INT. PENTHOUSE APARTMENT - DAY

INDY is ushered into a large Art Deco apartment and left alone. Numerous

museum-quality artifacts are displayed around the room. Indy takes this

opportunity to examine them.

After a moment, WALTER DONOVAN enters from across the room. During the

brief time that the door is open, we HEAR a COCKTAIL PARTY going on in the

next room: VOICES and SOFT PIANO MUSIC.

DONOVAN strides across the room toward INDY. Although in his late fifties,

Donovan has the broad shoulders and trim physique of a much younger man.

Dressed in a tuxedo, he exudes both confidence and power.

He shakes hands with INDY.

DONOVAN goes to a table where an object is wrapped in cloth. He throws back

the cloth revealing a flat STONE TABLETabout two feet square, inscribed with

letters and symbols.

INDY looks impressed. He puts on his glasses to make a closer examination.

Translating the inscription is no easy matter, even for someone as knowledgeable

as INDY.

Donovan pours champagne into several fluted glasses as Indy reads.

Suddenly INDY stops and looks up at DONOVAN with a startled expression.

INDY rubs his chin with a dubious expression as he takes the glass of champagne

DONOVAN now offers him.

INDY stiffens slightly at the mention of his father, nods.

The door opens and MRS. DONOVAN steps into the room. She's a matronly

woman in an expensive evening gown.

He leans over and kisses her cheek. MRS. DONOVAN sighs to herself and returns

to the party. INDY, meanwhile, has turned his attention back to the Grail Tablet,

obviously hooked by its archaeological promise. He moistens his finger with

champagne and rubs it over the tablet. DONOVAN steps up next to Indy.

INDY has to shake his head at DONOVAN's apparent lack of judgment.

DONOVAN produces an ANCIENT LEATHER-BOUND VOLUME with very brittle

pages. INDY views the manuscript with considerable interest.

EXT. A RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY

A FORD COUPE speeds down the tree-lined street.

EXT. PROFESSOR HENRY JONES' HOUSE - DAY

The Ford coupe pulls up in front of the house. INDY climbs from the car and

hurries up the walkway. BRODY is a step behind.

They climb the porch and notice that the front door is ajar. They exchange a

quick look of concern as they enter.

INT. THE HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

INDY approaches the half-open front door.

He pushes open the door. He enters the house and calls out.

INDY opens one half of the curtains dividing the hall from the sitting room.

We see the place has been ransacked.

BRODY sees INDY's face and opens the other half.

They walk into the room.

BRODY picks up some mail from Henry's cluttered desk.

INDY turns and sees the pile of torn papers and envelopes. Then something hits

him.

He immediately empties his pockets of his own mail taken earlier in the day from

his college office and finds the envelope with the Venice postmark.

INDY uncovers a small book. It looks like a JOURNAL or

DIARY. Indy flips through it: Page after page of

handwritten notes and drawings. BRODY glances at it with

great curiosity.

As INDY asks the question, he turns to a PAINTING on the wall: A depiction of

Christ on the Cross, his blood being captured in a golden chalice.

A SECOND PAINTING on the wall shows Eleventh Century Crusaders plummeting

to their deaths over a high cliff. One Crusader, however, floats safely in midair

because he holds the Grail in his hands.

BRODY sees that INDY is unsatisfied by this response.

EXT. AIRFIELD - DAY

A LIMO is parked beside a PRIVATE AIRLINER that bears the DONOVAN

CORPORATE LOGO. BRODY peers inside to DONOVAN and INDY.

BRODY and DONOVAN shake hands. INDY steps from the back seat of the limo.

He turns back to Donovan and shakes his hand.

INT. AIRLINER - FLYING - DAY

INDY opens the Grail Diary and thoughtfully turns through the pages. He stops

at one page and glances at a PENCIL SKETCH of what might be a stained-glass

window. Below the sketch is a SERIES OF NUMBERS.

EXT. THE PRIVATE AIRLINER - FLYING - DAY

SUPERIMPOSED over a MAP that traces a course from New York City to Venice,

Italy.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. VENICE - BOAT LANDING - DAY

INDY and BRODY disembark from the Water Bus onto the Boat Landing as other

Gondoliers steer their boats in the water.

Suddenly a WOMAN comes up to him. Attractive features. Blonde hair. Eyes

that are bright and intelligent.

She looks at him with an appraising expression that is brazenly flirtatious.

INDY is instantly attracted to her.

INDY grins, enjoying the repartee. The WOMAN turns to BRODY, who tips his hat.

The Woman, DR. ELSA SCHNEIDER, extends her hand to BRODY.

INDY's grin fades. BRODY registers a look of surprise.

EXT. VENICE CANAL - DAY

INDY, BRODY and ELSA walk along the narrow canal, lined with buildings on

either side.

INDY can't take his eyes off ELSA. Perhaps he's feeling a bit like a schoolboy

himself right now. As they cross over a bridge to the opposite side of the canal,

Indy steals a flower from a street vendor. He holds it out to Elsa.

INDY gives her the flower.

She hands a slip of paper to INDY.

INDY extends the scrap of paper to BRODY.

EXT. VENICE PIAZZA - DAY

ELSA leads INDY and BRODY into the large piazza. People walk about and sit at

tables in front of a large building.

They have arrived at the front steps of the library.

ELSA leads the way inside.

INT. THE LIBRARY - DAY

INDY, BRODY and ELSA enter, their heels CLICKING across the marble floor.

We notice, along with INDY and BRODY, that the library contains many stained-

glass windows.

She indicates FOUR HUGE MARBLE COLUMNS that go from floor to ceiling.

INDY glances at the Columns, then notices a Stained-Glass Window that depicts a

Knight of the Crusades. Indy lingers for a moment in front of the window.

The minute ELSA is out of earshot.

INDY whips out the Grail Diary and opens it to the sketch he noticed in the

airplane.

BRODY glances at the Diary, then at the windownoticing that the Roman

numerals in question have been worked into the window's design.

INDY and BRODY now see ELSA approaching. Indy quickly tucks the Diary back

into his pocket.

INDY doesn't reply. He's looking in five directions at once. His eyes moving

across the walls and ceilingscharged with the thrill of discovery.

ELSA wears a blank expression.

INDY's eyes travel up one of the four huge marble columns.

INDY has discovered that each Column is numbered with a Roman Numeral. Indy

hurries away toward Column VII. All BRODY and ELSA can do now is try to keep

up with him.

He points again to the stained-glass window.

He looks down to the scrap of paper in his hands.

INDY walks past aisles of book-lined shelves. He stops, turns, then looks down.

He climbs a spiral staircase leading up to a LOFT and looks down at BRODY and

ELSA. The floor beneath their feet is an elaborate tile design containing a huge

"X"visible only from this higher angle.

INDY rushes down the staircase and goes to the CENTER TILE where the two

sides of the X intersect. He blows dust away from the tile and tries to pry it up,

but cannot.

INDY rushes past BRODY to a cordon held in place by a brass stand underneath

the stained-glass window.

INDY raises the brass stand and timing his actions, hits the tile precisely as the

Librarian stamps a book. The Librarian regards the stamper curiously.

INDY continues to pound at the tile as the Librarian resumes his stamping, still

puzzled by the SOUND ECHOING through the library.

Finally INDY breaks the tile. As he bends to remove the pieces of broken tile, a

TWO-FOOT SQUARE HOLE IS REVEALED.

Cold air and a wet, rancid smell escape from the hole.

INDY is impressed with Elsa's spirit, and cooperates agreeablyholding her by

the hands and lowering her into the hole. When her feet finally touch ground

below, Indy releases his grip on her and slips the Grail Diary to BRODY.

Then INDY disappears into the hole.

INT. CATACOMBS BELOW LIBRARY - DAY

INDY jumps down a steep step. He reaches back to help ELSA.

INDY and ELSA glance around. This is really a horrid place. Dark and dank.

foul smelling. Elsa turns. She removes a cigarette lighter with a unique ivory

four-leaf clover design.

INDY and ELSA inspect markings carved onto the walls.

INDY takes the lighter from her and lights their way down a dark passageway.

INT. LIBRARY - DAY

THREE MEN carrying guns make their way down the spiral staircase toward an

unsuspecting BRODY. One of the Men, KAZIM, raises his gun and brings it down

hard on Brody's head.

KAZIM gestures with his gun toward the now-unconscious BRODY. The other two

men take Brody's hands and drag him into one of the book-lined aisles.

INT. ANOTHER PART OF THE CATACOMBS - DAY

DECOMPOSING CORPSES rest in niches carved into the stone walls. Grotesque

skeletal remains with rotting linen stretched across blackened bones.

INDY holds the lighter up as he and ELSA inspect symbols carved into the walls.

ELSA spots a symbol cut into the wall that she doesn't recognize. As she blows

away some cobwebs:

INDY only has to give it a quick glance to know.

INDY holds the lighter up and he and ELSA enter another dark passageway.

ANOTHER PART OF THE CATACOMBS

INDY steps to the wall and runs his hand over the stone. He scrapes the cobwebs

away to reveal the ROMAN NUMERAL "X."

ELSA now holds the lighter as INDY rams his shoulder into the wall. The wall

collapses on impact and Indy falls through into another room.

ANOTHER ROOM - THE CATACOMBS

as INDY falls through the hole in the wall onto rocks surrounded by bubbling,

green, slimy liquid. More skeletons surround him, resting in their carved niches.

ELSA holds the lighter as she peers in at him through the hole in the wall.

INDY reaches up and tears a piece of cloth from one of the skeletons, which

breaks apart and falls into the oil-slick water.

INDY uses the scrap of cloth and a bone to fashion a crude torch, which he then

dips into the oily water.

ANOTHER PART OF THE CATACOMBS

Using the cloth-wrapped bone torch to guide their way, INDY and ELSA come

upon a NARROW PASSAGEWAY. The water is knee-deep and TEEMING WITH

RATS. Thousands of them Crawling on one another's backs. SQUEALING.

Squirming. Thrashing in the water.

ELSA gasps as the rats scamper between her legs.

INDY moves forward through the rat-infested water as ELSA follows, still gasping

in horror. Suddenly he slips into a hole. Recovering his balance, he reaches out

to Elsa.

She gasps once again, terrified. INDY lifts her and carries ELSA as he moves

forward.

THE CATACOMBS - THE HOLE IN THE WALL

KAZIM and his men step to the opening Indy made earlier and shine their

flashlights through to the rat-infested water.

ANOTHER PART OF THE CATACOMBS

More rat-infested water as ELSA, now walking again, follows INDY through

another passageway lined with skulls and bones.

INDY reaches for a wall to steady himself and inadvertently grabs a skeleton. A

bone comes loose in his hand as rats scurry about and leap at him from all

directions.

He takes a moment to compose himself, then steps across the water to ELSA's

side. He steps into the water, then reaches up to help Elsa do the same.

LARGE BURIAL CHAMBER

The chamber is flooded with black, briny water.

In the center of the chamber, jutting up above the water, is what amounts to an

"island altar" on which SEVERAL ANCIENT COFFINS rest. They move toward the

altar.

INDY and ELSA begin to inspect the ornately carved COFFINS like the scholars of

antiquity that they are. These are big oak caskets held together by straps of

etched brass.

One coffin is elevated above the others.

Together they begin to push on the lidSTRAINING and GROANING until it

slides away and BANGS against the stone platform.

INSIDE THE COFFIN

lie the DECOMPOSED REMAINS of a KNIGHT IN ARMOR. INDY and ELSA look

in...Elsa gasps.

INDY unfolds a piece of paper and holds it over the shield.

The missing portion of the rubbing is completed by the shield.

INDY laughs.

CLOSE - A HAND

as it lights a match.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL KAZIM dropping the lighted match into the oil-slick

water.

INDY AND ELSA

ELSA holds the torch. INDY looks around. Listens. Something is wrong. And

then he sees the GLOW OF FIRELIGHT dancing across the Catacomb walls.

This is followed by THOUSANDS OF RATS FLEEING from around the corner of the

Narrow Passageway, STAMPEDING toward ELSA and INDYSHRIEKING and

SQUEALING as they approach.

The rats literally wash over themlike a rodent tidal wavein their efforts to

escape a:

HUGE ORANGE BALL OF FIRE

ROARING around the corner hurtling towards themfeeding on the oil slick;

consuming the oxygen.

ELSA SCREAMS.

INDY braces his back against the altar and TOPPLES THE COFFIN with his feet.

It CRASHES against the stone platform and SPLASHES into the water.

They jump into the water beside the bobbing, overturned coffin.

ELSA hesitates. INDY literally DUNKS her and pushes her underneath.

UNDER THE COFFIN

ELSA surfaces into the air pocket created by the coffin, SPUTTERING and

SPITTING.

Now INDY pops up into the air pocket. He looks at ELSAthey are both soaking

wet.

INDY disappears under the water and swims out from under the coffin.

UNDER THE WATER

INDY swims, looking for an escape route.

UNDER THE COFFIN

The rats are beginning to force their way inside, swimming through the water

and climbing on ELSA, who squirms and screams in terror.

INDY pops back up through the water.

ELSA groans. They take a deep breath and both dive under the water.

EXT. VENICE PIAZZA - OUTDOOR CAFE - DAY

The perfect picture postcardSt. Mark's Square and the Grand Canal beyond.

Cafe customers are startled to see INDY and ELSA climb out of the sewer, wet

and smelly. Indy looks around at the postcard-perfect setting and smiles.

Indy's delight, however, is short-lived since KAZIM and TWO OTHER TURKISH

AGENTS are running towards them with drawn guns.

He grabs ELSA by the hand and the two of them run down the dock and LEAP

INTO A MOTORBOAT.

INT. THE MOTORBOAT - DAY

INDY fires up the engine and pulls away from the dock... but not before a

Turkish Agent JUMPS in with him.

ELSA grabs the wheel and begins to steer the boat while INDY and the Turk trade

punches.

EXT. THE HARBOR - DAY

Indy's Speedboat BOUNCES across the choppy waters heading in the direction of

the DOCKED STEAMSHIP.

KAZIM and his men rush to TWO MORE SPEEDBOATS tied to the dock.

They chase after INDY.

INDY grapples with the Turkish Agent. As Indy grips his arms, we SEE a GUN in

the Agent's hand. It FIRES.

As INDY fights with the Turk, he becomes aware of the Speedboats behind him

and two enormous Freighters ahead of him, joined together by two giant ropes.

INDY, having gained the advantage, leans on top of the Turkish Agent.

ELSA can barely hear INDY over the noise of the motor.

INDY finally delivers the punch that sends the Turkish Agent flying overboard.

Turning, Indy sees that ELSA has committed the speedboat to a course BETWEEN

the two Freighters, now being pushed even closer together by a Tugboat.

It's purely academic at this point since the hulls of the the two Freighters loom

up on either side of them like cavern walls.

EXT. FULL SHOT - THE HARBOR - DAY

One Enemy Speedboat chases INDY between the two Freighters. But the Speedboat

containing KAZIM veers off and goes around.

EXT. BETWEEN THE TWO FREIGHTERS - DAY

It's a race for daylight as the two Freighters drift ever closer to one another.

Indy's Speedboat just manages to squeeze through the gap. But the Enemy

Speedboat EXPLODES as it is crushed between the two Freighters, FLYING INTO

THE AIR and SPLASHING back down into the water.

INDY AND ELSA

spin their boat around in a sharp half-circle to see KAZIM'S SPEEDBOAT appear

racing toward them. He stands in the moving boat, FIRING A MACHINE GUN at

INDY and ELSA.

KAZIM'S SPEEDBOAT

matches Indy's move for move.

FULL SHOT - THE HARBOR

The two boats race across the water nearly side-by-side. A CHATTERING

MACHINE GUN from Kazim's boat SPLINTERS the wood of Indy's boat, until

finally the rear of the boat CATCHES ON FIRE.

The machine gun runs out of ammunition. KAZIM puts it down and takes control

of the wheel from one of the Turkish Agents in the boat with him.

As Indy's boat drifts toward the GIANT, TURNING PROPELLERS at the STERN of

ANOTHER STEAMER, Kazim's boat draws up alongside and hits them. INDY

steps into Kazim's boat. He knocks one of the Turkish Agents to the deck, then

turns his attention to KAZIM. The two men trade punches as the boat spins

helplessly in the churning water.

INDY kicks KAZIM in the face, knocking him into the water, then pulls him back

into the boat, now being SUCKED THROUGH THE CHURNING WATER toward the

Steamer's giant propeller blades.

By now half the boat has been chopped up into matchwood and the blades are

getting closer.

The wind of the blades is on their necks. INDY grabs KAZIM just in time and

jumps... into the motorboat, driven by ELSA, which gets alongside in the nick of

time.

KAZIM pulls back his shirt to reveal a birthmark... or is it a tattoo? Whatever it

is, it's a cruciform sword; a Christian cross which tapers down, like the blades of

a broadsword.

The boat is close to the edge of the canal. INDY gives ELSA a nod, telling her to

bring the boat in. KAZIM steps ashore.

KAZIM walks away.

INT. VENICE APARTMENT - DAY

CLOSE ON THE WATER-SOAKED PAPER IMPRESSION: The rubbing taken from

the shield of the Grail Knight.

BRODY is giving it careful study while he dabs the lump on the back of his head

with an ice pack.

INDY, wearing a bathrobe, leans over to study the impression.

BRODY lowers the ice pack from his head and looks at INDY.

BRODY picks up the Grail Diary.

INSERT: A PENCIL-DRAWN MAP

It covers two pages of the Diary. BRODY's finger moves across it.

INDY closes the Grail Diary and puts it into the pocket of his robe.

INT. INDY'S BEDROOM - DAY

INDY opens the door. His bedroom has been ransacked...the mattress on the

floor, the drawers turned out.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

INDY approaches another door (Elsa's bedroom) and knocks.

He goes in.

INT. ELSA'S BEDROOM - DAY

... and finds that Elsa's bedroom is in a similar ransacked state to his own. The

room is empty.

He is worried for her, knocks and calls out:

He steps into the room and knocks upon the bathroom door.

He opens the bathroom door, peering inside.

INT. ELSA'S BATHROOM - DAY

Elsa is standing before a mirror, wearing a silk bathrobe. She gasps, startled, as

INDY enters. He retreats back into her bedroom as she reaches up to turn off a

record player sitting on a ledge above the bathtub.

INT. ELSA'S BEDROOM - DAY

ELSA joins INDY, waiting in the ransacked room. she looks around in shock.

She looks to INDY, who pulls the Grail Diary from his pocket.

She looks hurt and beautiful. She comes closer to him.

She's awfully hard to resist.

She stomps her foot angrily. INDY flinches. She starts to walk away but Indy

grabs her.

He pulls her to him and kisses her.

Now ELSA reaches for INDY and kisses him.

But he embraces her, and ELSA begins to nibble at his ear.

INDY smiles slyly as they fall to the bed.

EXT. VENICE CANAL - DAY

A GONDOLIER SINGS as he steers his gondola carrying two passengers past

Indy's window.

INT. INDY'S BEDROOM - DAY

INDY lies on top of ELSA, kissing her. He stops for a moment as he hears the

GONDOLIER SINGING.

ELSA reaches up and pulls him back down to her.

EXT. ROAD THROUGH THE AUSTRIAN MOUNTAINS - DAY

A Mercedes-Benz glides through the sharp mountain curves. This is

SUPERIMPOSED OVER A MAP that charts their course from Venice across Austria

toward Salzburg.

EXT. CASTLE IN THE AUSTRIAN MOUNTAINS - DAY

Storm clouds darken the skies. THUNDER EXPLODES in the

distance; lightning flashes. The Mercedes-Benz drives into the courtyard of the

formidable stone castle.

INT. MERCEDES-BENZ - DAY

INDY reaches into the back seat and retrieves his bullwhip.

He glances up to the beret ELSA is wearing. She reaches up and adjusts it.

INT. CASTLE ENTRANCE HALL - DAY

A BUTLER walks to the door and opens it to reveal INDY and ELSA standing

outside in the rain. she now wears Indy's fedora; Indy is wearing Elsa's beret.

INDY, followed by ELSA, steps inside, shaking the water from his overcoat. He

adopts a Scottish accent.

As INDY says this he pushes his way past the startled BUTLER, pulling a

handkerchief from the man's pocket. ELSA follows, taking off her coat. INDY

SNEEZES HARD.

INDY dabs at his nose with the handkerchief as ELSA looks on in amused

amazement.

Simultaneously knocking the BUTLER cold with one slug on the jaw. The Butler

falls against a wall tapestry, sliding down to the floor, out cold.

INT. CASTLE HALLWAY - DAY

INDY and ELSA move cautiously and quietly down the wide, vaulted hallway.

APPROACHING VOICES ARE HEARD. Indy and Elsa creep past a room full of

NAZI SOLDIERS working around a large table with a map atop it..

INDY reacts to the sight of them.

INDY and ELSA continue down the hallway. Indy carries a gun in his hand and

his whip hangs from his belt. He steps to a closed door and listens.

INDY points out an ELECTRICAL WIRE.

He studies the situation for a moment, then decides to enter one of the other

doors. He knocks at the doorthere is no response. He looks back at ELSA and

enters.

The room is dark and empty. INDY throws open the window shutters and looks

out. RAIN comes down in sheets. There is a wide ledge beneath each window

but below that is a SHEER DROP. Indy wants to get out onto the window ledge,

which is several yards away.

INDY reassures her.

He leans out the window and wraps his bullwhip around some wires that protrude

from the castle wall above the next window.

He gives the whip a forceful tug to make certain it will hold his weight.

EXT. THE CASTLE - DAY

INDY SWINGS from the window to the stone gargoyle.

CLOSE ON THE WINDOW LEDGE

A PAIR OF WOODEN SHUTTERS seals the window.

INDY takes hold of the bullwhip with both hands, pushes off with his feet...

swings toward the shuttered window with his feet extended... CRASHING

THROUGH THE WOODEN SHUTTERS as a CLAP OF THUNDER disguises the noise.

INT. THE ROOM - DAY

INDY CRASHES THROUGH SHUTTERS AND GLASS into the room. The broken

shutters hang by their hinges. Rain and cold air whip through the open window.

No sooner does Indy get to his feet, than a VASE COMES CRASHING DOWN ON

THE BACK OF HIS HEAD.

Stunned, INDY sinks to one knee... and Indy's father, PROFESSOR HENRY JONES,

steps out of the shadows.

INDY gets to his feet.

This reply is a kneejerk reaction on Indy's part. Now they look at each other.

NAZI VOICES ARE HEARD approaching. INDY and HENRY press themselves

against the wall, Henry still holding the broken vase in his hand.

INDY steps to the window and looks down. HENRY moves to a lamp, holding the

vase under the light for a closer look.

HENRY is all about the broken vase which he still holds in his hand. Father and

son get onto crossed lines for a couple of moments.

HENRY has clearly been concentrating entirely on the vase... he is examining the

broken end carefully.

HENRY throws the vase against the wall where it SHATTERS.

INDY steps to the door and stands, listening.

HENRY slides his umbrella through the straps of his bag.

INDY nods.

It's a great moment in HENRY's life. He turns aside, lost to himself for a

moment, then turns to INDY with joy.

INDY winces, and would interrupt but suddenly it's not the moment.

INDY's interest is a moment which becomes important later but for now it passes.

INDY's hand moves unconsciously to his pocket. His eyes turn inward.

Then... BAMI The door is kicked open and three NAZIS enter. One is an S.S.

OFFICER. The other two are SOLDIERS with machine guns. HENRY and INDY

raise their hands.

HENRY laughs genuinely, believing himself to be laughing at the expense of the

S.S. OFFICER.

At which point an awful thought strikes HENRY.

INDY's eyes blazes His nostrils flares He's so pissed off, he literally RIPS A

MACHINE GUN from the hands of one of the startled soldiers... and for a moment

we think he's going to use it on his dad.

He turns and sprays the room with machine gun fire, cutting all three NAZIS to

ribbons and blowing them backwards across the room.

HENRY looks shocked and horrified.

Indy grabs him and pushes him ahead.

INT. CASTLE HALLWAY - DAY

INDY leads HENRY down the hallway as he searches for Elsa.

He opens a door and enters:

INT. FIRST CASTLE ROOM - DAY

INDY and HENRY rush back into the room where ELSA had been left, only to

find: A Nazi COLONEL HOLDING ELSA HOSTAGE.

His name is VOGEL: a vicious-looking, lantern jawed brute. One arm is wrapped

around Elsa's waist, the other hand presses the muzzle of a LUGER behind her

ear.

INDY  is thrown. He doesn't know what to do. He looks at ELSA, then back to his

father. Everyone is yelling at once:

VOGEL jams the barrel of the luger painfully into ELSA's neck. Elsa SCREAMS.

And then Indy gives in. He drops the machine gun to the table and it slides

across, SHATTERING GLASS. HENRY GROANS audibly.

VOGEL releases his grip on ELSA and shoves her toward INDY. She is propelled

directly into his arms. He holds her tightly. She buries her face in his chest.

INDY comforts her.

Her hand slips into his coat pocket and removes the Grail Diary.

She steps back next to VOGEL. INDY is stunned. HENRY gives him his most

withering look of reprimand.

INT. BARONIAL ROOM - DAY

A large baronial room decorated with ancient tapestries and suits of armor.

Firelightfrom the giant fireplacedances across the ceiling and walls.

INDY and HENRY are ushered in, hands tied behind back, accompanied by VOGEL

and ELSA and TWO NAZI GUARDS.

ELSA crosses the room toward a high-backed chair facing the fireplace. INDY and

HENRY do not have the advantage of seeing who is sitting in that chair. They

only see a HAND REACH OUT AND TAKE THE BOOK.

INDY nods, and then the statement catches up with him. He looks at HENRY

with surprise.

The MAN IN THE CHAIR gets to his feet and turns, revealing himself to be...

WALTER DONOVAN. INDY and HENRY react with stunned expressions.

DONOVAN smiles benignly and flips through the Grail Diary.

ELSA rushes to DONOVAN's side. she takes the Grail Diary from him. Elsa takes

a look for herselfthen glances up at Indy.

HENRY gives INDY a look of surprise. Indy smirks.

HENRY now wears a pained expression.

HENRY looks amazed and impressed.

EXT. TRAIN STATION - CITY OF ISKENDERUN - DAY

BRODY disembarks from the train along with the other PASSENGERS, a cross-

section of ARABS and TUSKS.

A Man in the crowd holds out a cup of water to BRODY.

BRODY continues through the crowd past various STREET VENDORS. A Woman

holds a chicken out to him.

The Woman walks away, leaving BRODY alone in the crowd.

SALLAH shoulders his way through the mob toward BRODY.

They meet and hug, then begin to walk.

A Woman runs in and tugs on BRODY's coat. He waves her away.

BRODY searches in his coat pocket for the map as a SINISTER MAN approaches.

BRODY puts the map back in his pocket. The SINISTER MAN clicks his heels and

bows quickly.

BRODY takes off his hat.

The man turns and joins a SECOND MAN. BRODY and SALLAH follow them.

The SECOND MAN overhears SALLAH. He and his companion turn quickly.

SALLAH puts Brody's luggage down and glances at BRODY.

BRODY does not run. SALLAH pats his clothing, searching for his papers.

SALLAH laughs and pulls out a newspaper.

BRODY looks confused. SALLAH shows the newspaper to the SECOND MAN.

SALLAH puts the newspaper in front of the SECOND MAN's face, then punches

him through the newspaper.

The SECOND MAN falls, knocking over a vendor's stand. SALLAH and BRODY

begin to run. SALLAH knocks the FIRST MAN into another vendor's stand. The

STAND COLLAPSES on impact.

SALLAH grabs BRODY and pulls him through the crowded streets.

SALLAH points to a DARKENED DOORWAY, hung with a curtain, at the top of a

ramp. BRODY runs up the ramp, throws back the curtain and disappears into

the darkness.

ThenMETAL DOORS ARE SLAMMED behind Brody and we realize that he has

actually run into the back of a Nazi TROOP TRUCK.

SALLAH runs after the Truck until he reaches a wall, then leans against the wall

dejectedly as the Truck drives away with BRODY inside.

INT. CASTLE ROOM - DAY

The room is dark. Ancient, floor-length drapes cover the windows. A HUGE

FIREPLACE that's nearly large enough for a man to stand upright in dominates

one wall.

The NAZI GUARDS have tied INDY and HENRY back-to-back in a pair of chairs.

ELSA and DONOVAN stand over them. VOGEL enters.

He hands her the Grail Diary.

DONOVAN leads VOGEL out. The NAZI GUARDS follow. Once they are gone,

ELSA turns to INDY.

INDY shakes his head "no."

She runs her hand down the side of his face. INDY pulls away.

INDY and HENRY are still tied back-to-back of course. ELSA bends to speak

quietly into INDY's ear... which is near enough to Henry's ear.

She smiles and kisses INDY passionately. HENRY glances back and looks rather

disappointed.

VOGEL appears to remind ELSA of her appointment.

ELSA exits. VOGEL stays behind for another moment.

VOGEL punches INDY in the jaw. A hard and vicious jab that snaps Indy's head

around.

VOGEL exits. INDY shakes his head clear.

Indy and Henry are pulling at the ropes with great urgency.

HENRY is able to wiggle his hand towards Indy's coat pocket. INDY squirms his

body around towards Henry's hand.

HENRY's fingers open the lighter and ignite the flame.

HENRY yelps as the cigarette lighter burns his hand. He drops the lighter to the

floor. Henry kicks at the lighter, trying to reach it, but cannot. The rug starts to

burn. INDY doesn't know it yet.

They begin to rock their chair legs, inching their way off the burning carpet.

EXT. CASTLE - DAY

as ELSA is driven away. VOGEL and DONOVAN remain behind, flanked by NAZI

SOLDIERS .

Another car pulls up and VOGEL holds the door open for DONOVAN who gets into

the rear seat. A LIEUTENANT approaches with a written message for Donovan.

DONOVAN puts on his glasses to read the message.

A RADIO OPERATOR steps forward with yet another written message for

DONOVAN.

The car drives off.

INT. CASTLE ROOM - DAY

INDY and HENRY are still in their chairs, tied back-to-back. Indy tries to

communicate with Henry, but each time he calls him, the men turn their heads in

opposite directions.

Finally they turn their heads in the same direction.

BANGING, ROCKING and HOPPING their chairs, they work their way INTO THE

FIREPLACEthe only safe place from the now ROARING FIRE.

Indy struggles to free his hands. His foot kicks out and accidentally hits a metal

grill that operates a Secret Door.

The fireplace floor rotates like a Lazy Susan and Indy and his father find

themselves in the:

INT. RADIO ROOM - DAY

where a NAZI RADIOMAN wearing headphones sits at an elaborate panel of dials,

switches and meters, and a WOMAN stands over a map plotting coordinates.

Their backs are turned to INDY and HENRY.

The floor begins to rotate again, and INDY and HENRY find themselves back in:

INT. CASTLE ROOM - DAY

inside the fireplace, still tied back-to-back.

INDY glances over his shoulder at HENRY.

INDY's foot hits the grill again... and the fireplace rotates to:

INT. RADIO ROOM - DAY

FOUR NAZI RADIOMEN and the WOMAN are still hard at work with controls and

coordinates. Suddenly the Woman looks up and spots HENRY and INDY. She

screams.

Now the RADIOMEN turn to see HENRY and INDY.

TWO NAZIS draw their revolvers and FIRE SEVERAL SHOTS at INDY and HENRY

INT. CASTLE ROOM - DAWN

INDY and HENRY rotate into the room which is now an INFERNO. The carpet,

drapes and furniture are all ablaze.

INDY finally breaks free. And he immediately begins to untie his father.

INT. RADIO ROOM - DAY

All FOUR RADIOMEN now have their guns drawn. They activate the lever and

begin to rotate through the Secret Door.

INT. CASTLE ROOM - DAY

The RADIOMEN appear in the fireplace on the other sidebut there is NO SIGN

OF INDY AND HENRY.

The RADIOMEN move cautiously toward the flame, shielding their faces with one

hand, holding their guns with the other. Is it possible that INDY and HENRY

escaped through these flames?

Not a chance.

They've hidden themselves UP THE CHIMNEY. And now they DROP DOWN,

BEHIND the RADIOMEN.

One of the RADIOMEN grabs INDY by the neck. As they struggle they fall against

the rotating wall and disappear into the next room, leaving a frightened HENRY

behind.

HENRY presses against the wall, which rotates again. As he disappears into the

next room, a DEAD NAZI RADIOMAN swivels into the room. The other NAZIS

rush forward to him.

INT. RADIO ROOM - DAY

INDY picks up a BUST OF HITLER and uses it to jam the rotating wall in place,

sealing the NAZIS inside the burning room.

INT. CASTLE HALLWAY- DAY

Vogel strides purposefully down the hallway. He BARKS an order, and TWO

MORE NAZIS fall into step with him.

INT. RADIO ROOM - DAY

INDY grabs his whip, his leather sack and Henry's case from a table. He hands

the case to HENRY and they begin to run.

INT. SECRET ROOM - DAY

INDY and HENRY step into an empty room.

HENRY looks horrified by what he's been forced to do as INDY searches

frantically for an exit.

INDY begins to run his hands over the wallsfrantic.

HENRY sits on a chair which tips back, hitting the wall behind it. The floor at

INDY's feet suddenly begins DROPPING AWAYI

INDY grabs a railing to keep from falling, but loses his grip and plunges through

the opening which has formed a SPIRAL STAIRCASE. He rolls down the stairs.

HENRY follows INDY down the staircase.

INT. CAVERN/UNDERGROUND HARBOR - DAY

The stairway deposits Indy and Henry into an enormous WATERY CAVERN

beneath the mountain on which the castle was built.

A full-scale Nazi BOAT DOCK has been built inside the cavern. We see

MOTORBOATS, GUNBOATS, SUPPLY BOATS, etc.

INDY boards one of the motorboats and STARTS THE MOTOR.

HENRY tosses his case at INDY who catches it and angrily throws it back to his

father.

INDY moves back to the dock and pushes the boat away. HENRY looks confused.

INT. SECRET ROOM - DAY

VOGEL and the NAZI SOLDIERS enter the room and spot the spiral staircase

leading below. They quickly descend the stairs.

INT. CAVERN/UNDERGROUND HARBOR - DAY

as VOGEL and the NAZI SOLDIERS rush to the dock. Vogel sees that a motorboat

is missing. He orders the Nazi Soldiers into a boat.

CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL a large box which suddenly BREAKS APART

as INDY, now on a motorbike with HENRY in the sidecar, ROARS PAST THE

DOCK, hitting TWO NAZI SOLDIERS who scream as they fall into the river.

VOGEL screams after INDY and HENRY as they drive off.

STRAIGHT CUT TO:

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

INDY looks pleased as he drives the motorbike along the road, but HENRY

appears worried.

FOUR NAZI SOLDIERS ON MOTORCYCLES

They chase down the road after INDY and HENRY.

INDY turns the motorbike down a smaller, dusty tree-lined road. HENRY gasps

as he is jostled about in the sidecar. One of the NAZI SOLDIERS gives chase along

a higher road running in the same direction.

EXT. ROAD BARRICADE - DAY

INDY approaches the barricade from one direction as one of the NAZI SOLDIERS

approaches from a higher road.

A GUARD steps from the road station and calls to the vehicles as INDY and

HENRY SMASH THROUGH THE BARRICADE.

THE NAZI SOLDIER rides his motorcycle through the other side of the barrier--

IT SHATTERS.

INDY AND HENRY

INDY grabs at a FLAGPOLE as they roar pastit snaps off in his hand.

The NAZI SOLDIER drives his motorcycle toward INDY and HENRY. He

unshoulders his machine gun.

INDY uses the broken flagpole as a lance and knocks the NAZI SOLDIER from his

motorcycle.

THE RIDERLESS MOTORCYCLE

drives on toward the other NAZI SOLDIERS now approaching the guardhouse,

COLLIDING WITH TWO OF THEM.

The remaining NAZI SOLDIER maneuvers his motorcycle around his fallen

comrades and continues the chase.

INDY AND HENRY

As the remaining NAZI SOLDIER rides alongside their motorbike he cocks his gun,

preparing to fire.

INDY quickly jams the remaining portion of the flagpole through the spokes of the

Nazi's front wheel.

The NAZI SOLDIER'S MOTORCYCLE FLIPS THREE TIMES, throwing him high into

the air.

INDY glances back and smiles, but the smile fades as he looks forward again to

see a sign at a CROSSROAD. Arrows pointing in opposite directions indicate the

way to BERLIN or VENEDIG.

Indy starts down the road marked VENEDIG.

The motorbike skids to a stop.

HENRY slaps him across the face. INDY is rocked to his foundations, not by any

means entirely by the blow itself.

EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY

Arrows point in opposite directions to VENICE and BERLIN. The CAMERA MOVES

IN on the portion of the sign reading BERLIN.

EXT. CITY SQUARE - BERLIN - NIGHT

A Nazi Rallya book-burning is in process.

The mound of burning books is ten feet tall and growing by the minute as College

Students and Nazi Brownshirts continually toss more books onto the fire.

Flags, banners and standards displaying the swastika are waved rhythmically

from side to side in a motion that echoes the mounting frenzy of the enormous

crowd.

INDY and HENRY walk toward the Square. Indy wears the uniform of a Nazi

Soldier. He is now buttoning up the tunicwhich happens to be several sizes

too big.

Then... Indy sees something that makes him stop in his tracks. WE PAN ALONG

HIS LINE OF SIGHT to:

THE PODIUM

where high-ranking Officers of the Third Reich stand flanking ADOLF HITLER as

they oversee the rally.

ANOTHER ANGLE

ELSA is walking away in an open area, background of torches, vehicles, Nazi

Officers... one of whom is now none other than INDY, coming up to her before she

knows he is there. His voice is quiet and tough, his eyes hard.

Still startled, her reaction makes it clear that Indy is even now a lover in her

thoughts.

INDY pushes ELSA against a column and begins to search her clothing for the

Diary. He pulls the book from Elsa's pocket.

She understands him. It's as though he slapped her.

Now it's as though she'd slapped him back. His hands fly to her neck.

It's a standoff emotionally. He knows he'd never do it. she knows it too. And

the same goes for screaming.

INDY releases her and backs away. she looks at him with a lover's pain. He

moves over to HENRY.

They move off and almost run headlong into HITLER and his entire entourage

coming down from the Podium. 50 kids push their autograph books for Hitler's

signature.

HITLER pauses to sign them. Hitler looks Indy's way. They make eye contact. It

only lasts a moment but the moment is electric.

HITLER breaks the spell by taking the Grail Diary from him, opens it to the first

page and signs his autograph. He hands it back and moves on.

EXT. AIRFIELD - BERLIN, GERMANY- DAY

Indy's motorcycle pulls up to the main terminal.

INT. TERMINAL BUILDING - DAY

A Plainclothes Agent distributes leaflets bearing HENRY'S PICTURE to Nazi

Soldiers inside the terminal.

HENRY leans in a doorway reading a newspaper as INDY enters down the stairs

and taps Henry's shoulder.

They begin to walk toward the boarding gates.

INDY and HENRY show their papers to the Boarding Guards, then join the line of

passengers, which has already begun to move toward a:

MOORED ZEPPELIN

Ten stories tall and longer than two football fields: Flying in the grand tradition!

INT. THE ZEPPELIN - PASSENGER COMPARTMENT - DAY

The Zeppelin is about to take off. INDY and HENRY make themselves comfortable

in one of the compartments.

HENRY looks over his newspaper at INDY.

But INDY looks out the window and is suddenly concerned when he sees:

VOGEL AND A GESTAPO AGENT

rushing across the tarmac toward the Zeppelin.

INDY

sits back in his chair, looks to HENRY, now reading his newspaper.

A STEWARD enters and sets a bowl of nuts on the table in front of INDY and

HENRY, then continues down the aisle of passengers. Indy follows after the

Steward. He puts his arm around the Steward's shoulder and together they walk

up a flight of stairs.

VOGEL

now walks up the aisle. He approaches a MALE PASSENGER hidden behind a

newspaper. VOGEL uses his walking stick to lower the newspaper and show the

Passenger the leaflet with Henry's photograph.

The Passengers at the table shake their heads in the negative. VOGEL shows the

picture to other Passengers.

VOGEL turns to see:

INDY

WEARING THE HAT AND JACKET OF THE CHIEF STEWARD.

The Passengers do not react to the request, made in English.

VOGEL

approaches HENRY, still hidden behind his newspaper. Again, VOGEL uses his

walking stick to lower the paper, revealing Henry's face.

Now INDY, still playing the role of Steward, asks VOGEL for his ticket.

HENRY looks confused.

VOGEL glances up and recognizes INDYwho quickly punches Vogel in the face,

knocking him toward the window. In another quick move, Indy TOSSES HIM OUT

THE WINDOW onto the tarmac below.

Shocked Passengers blink in bewilderment.

Everyone else with a ticket quickly produces it and waves it in Indy's face.

EXT. AIRFIELD TARMAC - DAY

VOGEL gets to his knees as the huge Zeppelin rises into the sky above him,

revealing an airplane attached to the belly of the airship. Vogel shakes his fist at

the rising Zeppelin.

INT. ZEPPELIN - DAY

INDY and HENRY together again in their compartment.

HENRY opens his Diary and begins to thumb through it.

HENRY looks up from his Diary.

He closes the Diary and leans back in his seat.

INDY stutters uncomfortably as HENRY stares at him, waiting for a response.

Sunlight falls across the table from the window. INDY reaches for the drink. The

bar of sunlight turns like the hand of a clock over the tabletop across the drinks.

We see INDY puzzled. Only for a moment.

INT. FRAMEWORK OF ZEPPELIN - DAY

INDY and his father emerge from the hatchway into the belly of the Zeppelin.

The Zeppelin's elaborate metal framework is exposed.

INDY and HENRY hurry down the catwalk until arriving at a PAIR OF

DOORWAYS framed into the Zeppelin's outer skin.

Then INDY opens the doors. We see plenty of blue sky and white clouds. We also

see a small BIPLANE that is suspended from the Zeppelin by a HOOK & CRANE

DEVICE.

EXT. AIRPLANE - DAY

INDY climbs into the cockpit of the Biplane as HENRY takes the tail gunner's

seat.

INT. THE BIPLANE - DAY

INDY turns in his seat to give HENRY the "thumbs up." Henry smiles valiantly

and points down to the ground.

Then they both become aware of a STRANGE SOUND in the skies behind them.

Something between a ROAR and a WAIL.

TWO MESSERSCHMIDT FIGHTER BOMBERS

streak out of the clouds and race across the sky.

INDY AND HENRY

shrink in their seats as the MESSERSCHMIDTS (going three times as fast as they

are) SCREAM past on either side.

HENRY turns and grips the MOUNTED MACHINE GUN with a perplexed

expression.

HENRY pulls out his watch.

INDY uses his arm to demonstrate that he's referring to a direction and not a

time.

HENRY doesand the EXPLODING GUN nearly shakes him out of his seat.

Indy's slow speed and small size works to his advantage. The speeding

Messerschmidts continually overshoot him, WHIZZING past in a blurmaking

wide turns miles away in the sky.

HENRY has one of the Messerschmidts in his sight. He pulls back on the trigger

--RATTA-A-TAT-TAT!  RATTA-A-TAT-TAT!

The Messerschmidt banks to the left, but HENRY keeps it in his gun sight. Henry

swings the gun around, inadvertently CUTTING HIS OWN REAR STABILIZER IN

HALF.

INDY looks back at the missing tail section, then at his father.

The plane begins to go down. INDY struggles to control its descent.

HENRY slumps down fearfully in his seat.

EXT. A FIELD - DAY

The wheels of the plane touch down. OUT OF CONTROL, the PLANE SKIDS and

CRASHES first into a corral of goats and then into the farmhouse beyond sending

a cloud of dust into the air.

As INDY pulls himself from the cockpit:

Suddenly, INDY's attention is directed to:

TWO SCREAMING MESSERSCHMIDTS

coming in low. Guns BLAZING.

As BULLETS EXPLODE around them, INDY and HENRY jump over a stone

barricade. Henry, frightened, grabs at Indy.

EXT. ROAD - DAY

An OLD MAN kneels at his car repairing a rear tire.

THE MAN

turns to the wheel, the hubcap in his hands. Suddenly the wheel moves forward,

startling the Old Man.

INT. THE CAR - TRAVELING - DAY

INDY has the throttle down, both hands tightly gripping the steering wheel.

HENRY is a very nervous passenger.

INDY sees a LOW-FLYING MESSERSCHMIDT coming up behind him in the SIDE

MIRROR.

As the Messerschmidt ROARS by overhead, BULLETS EXPLODE around them,

narrowly missing the car.

EXT. THE ROAD - LONG SHOT - DAY

The car races toward a TUNNEL that cuts through a steep MOUNTAINSIDE.

The Messerschmidt bears down on Indy's car, machine guns CHATTERING.

The car ENTERS the tunnel. The Messerschmidt cannot pull up in time. It

SLAMS into the MOUTH OF THE TUNNEL, SHEARING OFF its WINGS.

INT. THE TUNNEL - DAY

The FLAMING FUSELAGE continues to ROCKET through the tunnel like a bullet

down the muzzle of a gun. SPARKS fly as its belly SCRAPES against the

pavement and the sides of the tunnel.

INT. THE CAR - DAY

Indy and Henry look over their shoulders to see this wingless BALL OF FIRE

gaining on them; about to overtake them.

EXT. THE ROAD - OTHER SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN - DAY

The car exits the tunnel at top speed and veers off the

road. The flaming Messerschmidt fuselage shoots past and

EXPLODES in the middle of the road.

INT. THE CAR - DAY

As the car emerges safely from the flames, Henry wipes the sweat from his brow.

HENRY looks out the windshield and sees the second Messerschmidt SCREAMING

out of the sky toward them.

EXT. THE ROAD - LONG SHOT - DAY

The MESSERSCHMIDT drops its single UNDER-FUSELAGE BOMB. It EXPLODES in

the road directly ahead of the car, missing it by only several feet.

THE CAR

FALLS INTO THE HOLE made by the bomb.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. ROAD - DAY

INDY climbs out of the car, still in the bomb crater. He turns back to HENRY.

INDY and HENRY run down the mountainside to:

A DESERTED MEDITERRANEAN BEACH - DAY

INDY and HENRY run to the shoreline. Indy reaches for his gun, tucked in his

pants. He opens the chamberthe GUN HAS NO BULLETS.

THE MESSERSCHMIDT

swings around and is coming in for another pass.

INDY AND HENRY

exchange a wordless glance. They don't even think about running: there is no

place to run to. HENRY hands his case to INDY.

Holding his umbrella, HENRY suddenly spins around and runs screaming and

shouting into A FLOCK OF SEA GULLS...

THE SEA GULLS take to the wing in flight. Thousands of them.

INDY

Bullets kick up sand leading up to him... then

THE MESSERSCHMIDT AND THE SEA GULLS meet in midair. MASSACRE! Sea

gulls are shredded by the Messerschmidt's whirling propeller blades into a

FEATHERY WHITE PUREE that SPLATTERS against the cockpit and CLOGS THE

ENGINE.

ENGINE SPUTTERS... STALLS... Silence. The Messerschmidt falls from the skies

and EXPLODES in an OFF CAMERA SOUND EFFECT.

INDY stands as beforestunneda statue.

HENRY walks back to INDY.

INDY wears a proud expression as he watches HENRY walk down the beach.

EXT. MOSQUE - DAY

FADE IN TITLE: "REPUBLIC OF HATAY"

FADE OUT TITLE.

EXT. COURTYARD OF SULTAN'S PALACE - ISKENDERUN - DAY

The SULTAN is seated in his royal chair, flanked by WALTER DONOVAN and

VOGEL and surrounded by his minions.

DONOVAN holds the missing Grail Diary pages.

DONOVAN and the SULTAN walk together through an archway.

TWO NAZI SOLDIERS bring forward a HUGE STEAMER TRUNK. They open the lid

and begin to empty it of its contents:

Gold and silver objects of every description.

The SULTAN gets up from his chair and walks toward the trunk. He goes right

past it and begins to inspect the Nazi staff car parked nearby.

The SULTAN points to the engine under the hood.

Somebody else is also taking note...and we see that it is KAZIM, the spy at the

court.

ELSA is revealed coming down the stairs toward DONOVAN and VOGEL.

EXT. ISKENDERUN STREET - DAY

SALLAH drives his car through the crowded streets, INDY beside him and HENRY

in the back seat.

SALLAH waves his arms and shouts to a CAMEL HERDER.

HENRY removes his hat and hits INDY with it.

EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY

VOGEL snatches the canteen away from BRODY before he can drink.

He hands the map to ELSA, drinks from the canteen, and hands that back to

DONOVAN.

HENRY and SALLAH are at INDY's side as he views Donovan's party in the

distance. Parked nearby is a CAR containing all of their supplies.

Then Donovan notices a reflection from the hills.

What he sees is:

THE SUN REFLECTING OFF THE LENSES OF INDY'S BINOCULARS

At that moment the tank FIRES A SHELL in their direction.

It WHISTLES overhead and BLOWS UP THE PARKED CAR. INDY, HENRY and

SALLAH cover their heads as automobile fragments rain down upon them.

EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY

KAZIM peers over a rock, pointing his rifle at the group below.

BULLETS EXPLODE off the vehicles and cliff. DONOVAN and ELSA duck.

A NAZI SOLDIER falls from the tank as BULLETS EXPLODE around him.

KAZIM'S MEN, BRETHREN OF THE CRUCIFORM SWORD, continue to FIRE. ELSA

and DONOVAN take cover beside the parked car.

ANGLE ON INDY'S GROUP

INDY and HENRY, followed by SALLAH, take cover behind a rock to watch

Kazim's Men and the Nazi Troops exchanging fire below them.

CUT BACK to the action. The BRETHREN are firing at the

DONOVAN party and are being fired on by the Donovan party.

TWO NAZI SOLDIERS throw HAND GRENADES into the cliffs. They EXPLODE,

killing one of Kazim's Brethren.

The battle continuesa fierce exchange of GUNSHOTS, GRENADES and

MACHINE GUN FIRE with losses on both sides.

INDY AND SALLAH

crouch behind a rock watching as men on both sides of the battle run amongst

camels and horses.

DONOVAN AND ELSA

They look down at KAZIM who lies mortally wounded on the ground at their feet.

ELSA looks saddened.

KAZIM dies.

INDY

leaps atop a TURKISH SOLDIER on horseback, pulling the man and the horse to

the ground. A SECOND TURK comes to assist his comrade; INDY mounts the

horse, knocking both Turks to the ground.

INT. THE TANK - DAY

BRODY has been left alone in the tank. HENRY climbs down into the tank and

taps Brody on the shoulder, startling him.

They exchange an old University Club toast, swinging their arms at one another

and missing. Then HENRY flaps his arms and tugs his ears.

Now BRODY tugs his ears, flaps his arms and touches his head.

They exchange a handshake.

As HENRY starts to climb out of the tank, TWO NAZI SOLDIERS DROP DOWN from

above, their Lugers drawn. They are followed by VOGEL.

The NAZI SOLDIERS point their guns at HENRY and BRODY.

VOGEL removes a glove and slaps HENRY with it.

He slaps HENRY again.

Another slap.

VOGEL reaches out to slap HENRY yet again, but Henry grabs his arm, stopping

him.

DONOVAN appears at the turret cover.

EXT. TANK - DAY

EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY

INDY rides away on one horse, leading three others as he goes.

SALLAH approaches on horseback leading five camels.

INDY and SALLAH charge forward leading their horses and camels.

Then VOGEL commands the Tank Driver to give chase.

INT. TANK - DAY

VOGEL shouts to the Tank Driver.

EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY

The tank starts firing at INDY on horseback. Indy zigs and zags as the tank fires

two rounds at Indy, barely missing him. Each time Indy emerges from the plume

of desert dust, hanging like a toadstool in the air.

INT. TANK- DAY

HENRY and BRODY hold their hands over their ears.

EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY

DONOVAN shouts orders to the Troops. INDY is followed by various vehicles in

the caravan.

INDY notices that the side gun that is now firing at him can only pivot so far.

Indy makes a mental note of this and while riding right in front of the tank,

turns his horse completely around, 180 degrees. The tank starts to follow.

POV THROUGH THE VIEWING PORT

VOGEL watches the ground turning 180 degrees as he tries to catch up with

INDY.

Cleverly, INDY has turned the tank directly into a head-on

collision course with some of the pursuit vehicles and a Kubelwagon.

The tank and the Kubelwagon smash into each other, the German military sedan

becoming lodged between the treads while blocking the front view and any use of

the six-pound cannon on the turret.

INDY, meanwhile, leans down on his horse, scooping up a stone from the wall of

a culvert. He reigns his horse, paralleling the tank, as everyone scurries about

inside, looking through viewing ports, trying to figure out exactly where Indy is.

INT. TANK- DAY

VOGEL shouts to the Gunner.

The Gunner puts a shell into the large gun. He FIRES, CATAPULTING THE

KUBELWAGON into the air, where it EXPLODES.  The tank drives through the

resulting smoke an dust, then rolls over the Kubelwagon, crushing it

EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY

INDY gallops up to the side cannon and jams the stone down the barrel, lodging

several rocks inside. Then he steers his horse directly in range of that gun.

INT. TANK - DAY

A NAZI SOLDIER pushes HENRY away from the window.

He points his gun at HENRY and BRODY.

The smaller gun, blocked by the rocks, BACKFIRES, blowing the breech out into

the face of the gunner, killing him and filling the tank with smoke.

BRODY, HENRY, VOGEL and the driver begin to choke.

EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY

INDY rides his horse alongside the tank.

INT. TANK - DAY

HENRY and BRODY still held at gunpoint by the NAZI SOLDIER.

The NAZI SOLDIER swings his fist, knocking HENRY off his seat.

EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY

Smoke pours from the top of the tank as the turret pops open. VOGEL emerges

and aims his gun at INDY.

INDY and VOGEL EXCHANGE SHOTS as Indy chases the tank on his horse.

INDY pulls the trigger againhis gun is empty! Indy immediately takes the

high trail.

Now INDY is above the tank twelve feet on a paralleling trail. He moves out of

the saddle and leaps from the speeding horse onto the trundling tank.

CLOSE UP - VOGEL

Hate-staring at INDY

CLOSE UP - INDY

Hate-staring back at VOGEL.

SIDE ANGLE

One of the two troop carriers is paralleling the tank and like pirates boarding a

galleon, Nazi Soldiers leap over the treads and are swarming all over INDY.

INDY is struggling with a German's Luger.

INDY presses the luger against his assailant and forces the Nazi to squeeze off a

shot into himself. The bullet not only passes through the Nazi, but passes

through two other Nazis standing directly behind him on the crowded tank top

and three bodies fall away, leaving Indy to stare at the gun in disbelief.

Another Soldier leaps from the truck onto the tank and raises his knife as he

grabs INDY. They struggle and fall.

INDY sits up to see VOGEL standing over him. Vogel wraps a chain around Indy's

neck.

INT. TANK- DAY

INDY appears at the entrance, the chain still wrapped about his neck and held by

VOGEL.

He drops the gun down into the tank.

VOGEL pulls INDY from the tank entrance, yanking on the chain wrapped around

his neck.

EXT. TANK - DAY

A NAZI SOLDIER approaches.

INDY hits him, knocking him onto the tank tread. The Nazi Soldier screams as he

is dragged under the rolling tank.

Now INDY and VOGEL struggle with one another, the chain still wrapped around

Indy's neck.

INT. TANK- DAY

THROUGH THE PERISCOPE

We SEE INDY and VOGEL struggling atop the tank. Indy lifts his feet, lunging

toward the periscope and pulling Vogel with him.

INDY's face is pressed up against the lens of the periscope.

INT. TANK - DAY

The NAZI SOLDIER looking through the periscope pulls away from it, smiles, then

turns back to it.

THROUGH THE PERISCOPE

INDY's face, still pressed against the lens.

VOGEL pulls INDY from the periscope.

INT. TANK - DAY

The NAZI SOLDIER pulls away from the periscope again.

EXT. TANK - DAY

INDY now lies on top of VOGEL. He kicks out at the periscope which spins

around.

INT. TANK - DAY

The periscope handle spins around and hits the PERISCOPE SOLDIER in the head.

He falls against the NAZI SOLDIER guarding HENRY and BRODY.

HENRY pushes the NAZI SOLDIER aside and grabs the gun. The PERISCOPE

SOLDIER struggles to take the gun from Henry.

EXT. TANK- DAY

VOGEL holds the chain around INDY's neck, pushing his head downward toward

the revolving tread.

INT. TANK - DAY

The PERISCOPE SOLDIER holds HENRY from behind, forcing the gun toward him.

Henry reaches down and pulls a fountain pen from his coat pocket.

As the PERISCOPE SOLDIER pulls on HENRY's face, Henry lifts the fountain pen

and squirts ink into his face. The Soldier falls, his head smashing into the wall of

the tank. At the same time, Henry loses his grip on the gun which falls to the

floor.

EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY

A troop truck pulls near the tank.

INT. TANK- DAY

HENRY fires the TANK GUN at the troop truck. SOLDIERS FLY INTO THE AIR.

The TROOP TRUCK flips over and EXPLODES.

EXT. TANK - DAY

The EXPLOSION knocks INDY off the tank and onto the tread. He grabs onto the

shredded gun protruding from the side of the tank.

VOGEL looks down at INDY and smiles smugly.

The tank is approaching a cliff wall. As INDY tries to secure footing, VOGEL

steps on his hands.

INT. TANK - DAY

BRODY looks at HENRY.

EXT. TANK - DAY

VOGEL now swings a shovel at INDY, smashing at his hands.

BRODY climbs up out of the tank, followed by HENRY.

A NAZI SOLDIER appears and pulls HENRY down.

VOGEL raises the shovel above his head and brings it crashing down on INDY,

still hanging from the protruding gun.

INDY loses his grip and now hangs from the gun suspended only by the strap of

his leather pouch. He screams as the gun scrapes against the cliff wall, sending

stones tumbling down over him.

INT. TANK - DAY

The NAZI SOLDIER knocks HENRY into a pile of boxes, then punches him in the

face.

As the SOLDIER raises the gun to HENRY's face, BRODY hits him over the head

with a canister. The Soldier falls, discharging the gun into the air.

The BULLET RICOCHETS around the tank, past the Tank Driver who is

manipulating levers at the control panel. SPARKS FLY; then the BULLET PINGS

AGAINST THE WINDOW and RICOCHETS ONCE MORE, this time passing THROUGH

THE TANK DRIVER'S HAT. Blood flows from under the hat as the Tank Driver

slumps forward, his body depressing the levers.

EXT. TANK - DAY

INDY still hangs from the strap of his leather pouch as the tank swerves, barely

missing the rocks and causing VOGEL to fall. Indy finally manages to pull

himself atop the tank once more where he punches Vogel over the side, then

peers down to HENRY, still inside the tank.

INDY pulls HENRY and BRODY from the tank. VOGEL pulls himself back atop the

tank armed again with the shovel which he swings at Indy, who ducks and grabs

Vogel's arm.

As INDY winds up to punch VOGEL he catches BRODY in the face on the

backswing, then completes the movement and knocks Vogel down.

INT. TANK - DAY

Vogel's hat sails in and falls to the floor.

EXT. TANK- DAY

Before INDY can answer, VOGEL is up and swinging with the shovel. Indy ducks

but the shovel catches HENRY sending him over the side and onto the moving

tread.

INDY grabs his whip, knocking VOGEL aside.

As HENRY speeds toward the front of the tank to certain doom, INDY, with

lightning speed, whips out his bullwhip, wrapping the end of the whip around

Henry's right ankle.

HENRY is bouncing across the treads like a rag-doll. INDY struggles to hold onto

the end of the bullwhip.

SALLAH draws his horse next to the treads. He tips his fez to HENEY.

VOGEL now punches INDY in the back and grabs him around the neck. Still,

INDY refuses to let go of the whip.

SALLAH reaches out to HENRY.

SALLAH manages to hold onto HENRY as he brings his horse to a stop just at the

cliff's edge.

INDY finally frees himself of VOGEL's grasp, twisting his arm painfully away

from Indy's neck, then landing a hard blow to Vogel's head.

INDY

looks down at the fast-approaching cliff, his face filled with horror.  We SEE his

HAT BLOW OFF and sail over the cliff's edge.

VOGEL

He sees his life passing before him, he screams at the top

of his lungs!

LONG SHOT

The tank trundles over the cliff and PLUMMETS TO THE BOTTOM.

EXT. CLIFF EDGE - DAY

HENRY, BRODY and SALLAH look down at the flaming wreckage

of the tank.

We HEAR the TANK EXPLODING.

And then... looking dazed and bewildered, INDY STAGGERS UP BEHIND THEM.

He joins the others at the edge of the cliff, looking down at the wreckage below

with a bewildered expression.

Finally, Henry becomes aware of his presence.

HENRY says nothing. He just looks at Indy, overcome with emotion. Finally, he

throws his arms around him.

After a moment, Indy's head clears. And he becomes aware of his father's

embrace. Something he hasn't felt in a long timeif ever. And it touches him.

He hugs his father back.

BRODY and SALLAH are moved by this sudden reconciliation.

HENRY pats INDY on the back and Indy collapses, sitting hard on the rocky cliff

edge.

Unaware, HENRY, SALLAH and BRODY start to walk away. Henry turns back to

see INDY still sitting on the ground.

HENRY turns and walks toward the horse with BRODY and SALLAH. Suddenly

the FEDORA, borne on the wind, BLOWS INTO SCENE and lands at INDY's feet.

EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

DONOVAN peers through binoculars to see the CANYON OF THE CRESCENT

MOON. He lowers the binoculars and turns to ELSA.

Now ELSA peers through the binoculars.

EXT. SECRET CANYON - DAY

INDY, HENRY, SALLAH and BRODY ride into the canyon. They hear a WAILING

WIND. Feel the biting cold. And sense the danger.

Now we turn a corner and they see the hidden city. Its spectacular Grecian

facade is carved directly into the rock. It is a stunning sight. The vehicles,

camels and horses belonging to DONOVAN's party have been left at the entrance.

INT. TEMPLE - DAY

INDY, SALLAH, HENRY AND BRODY creep forward to see:

THE TERRIFIED FACE OF A TURKISH SOLDIER

He's walking slowly. Eyes darting. Muttering a prayer under his breath.

What's going on here?

FULL SHOT - INSIDE THE MOUNTAIN TEMPLE

THE TURK stands alone in the center of the Temple. It is very dark. GIANT

COLUMNS define the Temple's perimeter.

ELSA AND DONOVAN

watch him from a safe distance.

THE TURK

is about to approach the spot where a TURKISH SOLDIER LIES DEAD. We don't

notice it right away, but the dead soldier has been DECAPITATED.

THE TURK stopsonly one step away from the beheaded soldier.

THE TURK

takes one more stepa fatal step, it turns out. We hear a ROARA WHOOSH

of airbut we SEE NOTHINGexcept THE TURK'S HEAD FLY OFF AND

BOUNCE across the ground.

INDY, HENRY, BRODY AND SALLAH

react to the sight.

ELSA AND DONOVAN

She looks at him, horrified.

TWO NAZI SOLDIERS force another Turk forward. Suddenly...

The SOUND OF RIFLE BOLTS being cocked. Everyone turns to discover INDY and

his party surrounded by NAZI SOLDIERS. Indy's group are relieved of their guns.

FULL SHOT - THE TEMPLE

INDY, HENRY, BRODY and SALLAH are brought forward by the Nazi Soldiers.

ELSA's eyes light up: glad Indy's not dead. she controls herself and continues

more coldly.

INDY laughs.

Then DONOVAN shifts his aim, just a bit, and SHOOTS HENRY. The bullet enters

his side below the ribs.

HENRY collapses. Blood flowing from the wound. BRODY and SALLAH rush to

his assistance.

INDY spins toward DONOVAN with murder in his eyes.

DONOVAN points the gun at him:

INDY hesitates.

INDY takes in the situation. The two decapitated men lie a few yards in front of

him. He walks to the entranceway, flanked by two stone lions. We get silent

reaction shotsELSASALLAHBRODYDONOVANregistering their

different emotions

INDY proceeds forward. His hands open the Grail Diary.

INDY takes a few steps forward.

INDY stops. He is about to reach the spot where two men have just died.

HENRY looks at INDY. Indy looks at Henry.

INDY takes a step forward through the cobwebs.

The cobwebs begin to move....

We hear the awful rush of airWHOOSH! Because INDY is in the act of

kneeling, only his hat is knocked off and his hair flies in his face.

Instinctively he ROLLS FORWARD on the ground out of harm's way and looks up.

From his new position he is able to see what is causing all the trouble: A RAZOR

SHARP TRIPLE PENDULUM.

INDY gets cautiously to his feet. Now he sees the pendulum has been guarding a

SMALL CORRIDOR which turns a corner to the left fifty yards ahead. Wooden

wheels turnthe mechanism controlling the spinning blades. INDY loops a rope

around the wheels, jamming the mechanism and stopping the blades in mid-swipe.

ELSA AND DONOVAN

BRODY and SALLAH smile, relieved.

HENRY shakes his head.

BACK TO INDY

holding the Grail Diary, reading once again, his fedora now covered in cobwebs.

INDY pulls away some cobwebs to reveal a cobblestone path. Each cobble is

engraved with a letter.

HENRY

lifts his head painfully.

BACK TO INDY

as he studies the cobblestones before him.

HENRY

still lies in SALLAH's arms. BRODY leans over him.

BACK TO INDY

INDY takes a step and immediately a stone breaks away and INDY falls up to his

hip -- his leg stuck through the hold where the stone once was.

HENRY

reacts.

BACK TO INDY

who grunts as he pulls himself from the hole, the v-rail Diary in his hand.

Now we SEE each letter on the stones as INDY carefully walks forward.

DONOVAN and ELSA follow in his footsteps.

INDY sighs with relief and steps forward to:

THE GREAT ABYSS

INDY stands in a small opening, just small enough for his shoulders to squeeze

through and beyond that a 100 foot drop to the rocks below and 100 feet across,

nothing but a rough, stony cliff wall.

BACK TO INDY

He can see nowhere to cross. He looks again to the v-rail Diary.

INDY looks around and then he notices that inscribed into

the rock above his head is the head of a lion.

INDY looks down into the Diary and tortures over what it

is asking him to do.

BRODY

rushes forward and calls to INDY.

BACK TO INDY

HENRY

calls to his son.

We see him do it. We see him leap into space. We see that he is in midair. We

see that he is not going to make it. His hands claw for the opposite wall but he is

going to fall 100 feet to his death. And thenhe doesn't! He appears to be held

up by thin air as he lands on his hands and knees.

INDY looks around and down and now he figures it out.

Ingeniously, the First Crusaders have painted a pathway to align with the rocks

100 feet below. It is a perfect forced perspective image of the rocks below with

lines from a hundred feet continuing six feet below his sight line where his feet

are stepping.

It's painted to blend in with the rocks below. Highly evolved camouflage... in

perfect alignment with everything we see below.

When INDY leans out to the left or right... that's when he sees the perfect

alignment shift that betrays the trick. Indy throws some dirt on the bridge and

he crosses it like the first Crusader from the painting over Henry's desk.

Indy crawls through a small opening in the side of the cliff and enters a Temple.

A vast array of chalices is displayed on the altar of this small Temple. Perhaps a

hundred or more. Many sizes, many shapes, some gold, some silver, but they all

glitter and shine.

INDY is mesmerized by their number and their beauty. And then he realizes that

a man is praying at the altarl

He has his back turned to INDY... but he is dressed as what he is! A GRAIL

KNIGHT.

CLOSE ON THE GRAIL KNIGHT

But we can't see the Grail Knight's face. The visor of his helmet is down.

Perhaps we see his eyes.

When the GRAIL KNIGHT sees INDY he gets wearily to his feet and, surprisingly,

prepares to give combat...taking up his two-handed broadsword...he comes at

Indy, attempting to swing the huge, heavy sword but finding the effort almost too

much. Indy dodges two or three clumsy swings of the sword, making no attempt

to fight back...until the Knight, exhausted, drops the sword and collapses. Indy

approaches him and raises the visor and we see that the Knight is a very ancient

man.

The GRAIL KNIGHT reaches forward and fingers Indy's clothing.

The GRAIL KNIGHT holds his sword out to INDY.

At that moment DONOVAN and ELSA appear. Donovan turns to face the display

of cups.

ELSA and INDY exchange looks. He thinks he is seeing her in her true colors.

ELSA chooses a cupa solid gold, emerald encrusted goblet.

DONOVAN instantly takes it from her.

DONOVAN rushes to the well and fills the goblet with water.

DONOVAN drinks from the goblet.

Then, DONOVAN'S entire body starts to convulse. His face contorts in agony. He

grabs his stomach and turns toward ELSA.

He starts to agefast! His hair grows long and gray and brittle. His face sinks.

Fingernails curl back on themselves. Milky cataracts coat his eyes.

ELSA gasps and screams.

His skin turns brown and leathery and stretches across his bones until it splits.

His skeletal hands reach for ELSA's throat, choking her.

INDY rushes forward and pushes DONOVAN away. As he falls he BODY BREAKS

INTO FLAMES, then SHATTERS AGAINST THE WALL.

INDY studies the array of chalices.

INDY picks up another cupa simple earthenware jug.

He and ELSA exchange a look.

INDY goes to the well and fills the earthenware jug with water, then pauses.

INDY brings the jug to his lips and takes several large swallows.

A strange sensation overcomes him, a feeling of peace and contentment...and we

see his wounds begin to heal.

CUT TO BRODY AND SALLAH who attend to Henry awaiting Indy's return.

INDY and ELSA come forward with the Grail.

The TWO NAZI SOLDIERS are over-awed by the possessors of the Grail. They put

down their guns and kneel.

INDY kneels by HENRY's side and tilts his head forward and holds the Grail to

his lips.

HENRY is too weak to even open his eyes.

HENRY swallows some of the water. Much of it runs down the corners of his

mouth. Finally INDY pours the water over the wound and everyone watches in

astonishment as the wound and the blood stain disappear before their eyes. The

color returns to Henry's face.

HENRY's eyes open. The first thing he sees is the Grail and they light up. Then

they shift to INDY's faceand they light up even more...

NAZI SOLDIERS

run forward. SALLAH points a rifle at them.

The NAZI SOLDIERS drop their weapons at their feet and raise their arms in

surrender.

ELSA

steps forward and picks up the Grail. She turns to INDY, her face alight with

possession of the Grail.

ELSA steps onto the edge of the Great Seal.

A RUMBLING SOUND IS HEARD and the ground roars and shifts. Dirt falls from

the ceiling of the cavern. ELSA falls on the Great Seal. The Grail bounces away

from her grasp. She reaches for it and the ground beneath her begins to SPLIT

OPEN. ELSA slips into the crevasse. She screams.

ELSA is hanging perilously in the abyss, with the Grail almost within her reach.

As her hands lose their grip, INDY just manages to one of them, he himself

sliding forward across the slanted floor.

With her free hand, ELSA is trying to get the Grail. INDY can't save her unless

she gives him her free hand. She has to choose.

Her hand begins to slip from Indy's grasp.

ELSA just manages to touch the Grail. In doing so, she has tipped the balance too

farINDY slides down another yard, Elsa loses her grip and falls screaming to

her death.

Now the ledge INDY lies upon begins to break apart. HENRY grabs one of his

hands as Indy struggles to reach the Grail with the other.

INDY looks down into the black bottomless pit beneath him from which nothing

can ever be retrieved.

INDY snaps his look up to his father. His father has never called him this before.

INDY abandons the Grail and grabs onto HENRY with both hands.

HENRY pulls him up to safety.

THE GRAIL KNIGHT

looks through the falling debris to INDY and HENRY. SALLAH and BRODY rush

from the crumbling Temple.

The GRAIL KNIGHT raises his arm to HENRY.

INDY and HENRY down the passageway just as a huge stone column tumbles

down upon the spot where they stood. The GRAIL KNIGHT lowers his arm as he

watches them leave.

EXT. ENTRANCE TO MOUNTAIN TEMPLE - AFTERNOON

INDY, HENRY, SALLAH and BRODY emerge from the Mountain Temple through

the Grecian Facade.

From within the Mountain Temple, the ROAR OF WALLS CAVING IN IS HEARD. A

cloud of dust and smoke billows out from the entrance.

HENRY turns to INDY.

HENRY and INDY mount their horses. Henry turns back to his son.

A moment passes as they all ready their mounts and SALLAH continues to laugh

at INDY.

EXT. THE SECRET CANYON - AFTERNOON

They THUNDER through the canyonwhose towering walls threaten to collapse

upon them.

EXT. ENTRANCE TO CANYON - SUNSET

as BRODY, INDY, HENRY AND SALLAH ride from the canyon toward the SETTING

SUN.
