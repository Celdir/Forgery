INT. DARKROOM - INTERVIEW 1

In a photographic DARKROOM: old optical enlargers, porcelain

trays, timers, and stills hanging out to dry.

GEORGE MATLIN, a slightly obese, nearsighted man in his

seventies.

Super: CPL. GEORGE MATLIN, combat photographer.

Matlin smiles as he paws through a box of old negatives.

Someone turns on the darkroom's red safety light for an eerie,

dramatic effect.

INT. SUBMARINE HALLWAY - NIGHT

YOUNG MATLIN's hands again paw through a bunch of negatives,

again under a red light. Now, at 21, he's wedged in a

submarine corridor, a crowded maze of pipes and gauges.

35mm still cameras dangle from his neck. He shrinks back as

a squad of MARINES hustles past him, loading weapons.

SGT. WHITMAN, 44, tough as nails, pushes through, his uniform

soaked in sweat.

Whitman continues down the passageway until he reaches a

small...

INT. SUBMARINE STATEROOM - NIGHT

Within, an incongruously proper young Englishman "reading"

an ancient set of Tarot cards.

TREVOR "BROOM" BRUTTENHOLM is a gaunt, olive-skinned man in

his late twenties. In his hands, a tarot deck. He turns the

cards face up: THE FOOL, THE MOON...

Broom grabs a worn-down wooden box full of books and amulets.

It has a leather strap that allows him to carry it, much

like a carpenter's tool box.

He moves away. Broom takes a small box and a few amulets.

Before exiting, he pauses and tensely turns the last TAROT

CARD: THE DEVIL.

OMIT

INT/EXT. SCOTLAND - TUNNEL - NIGHT

Super: OCTOBER 9, 1944, SCOTLAND.

It's raining like hell now. Soldiers move through a short

tunnel carved into the mountain.

Whitman signals his men to spread out, then comes alongside

Broom.

EXT. SCOTLAND CHAPEL REMAINS

They enter the remains of a small chapel. Broom produces the

small box. It's full of rosaries.

Whitman scowls and huffs. A life-sized wooden Christ

contemplates the scene from above.

Whitman locks and loads an automatic.

He moves away. Broom looks up to the wooden Christ: It has

no eyes.

EXT. DITCH

MATLIN hauls his tripod and gear and joins the troops on the

move. Broom catches up with Whitman.

Reaching a slope, Matlin sets down his camera. Turning, he

sees lights.

Drenched, Broom and Whitman look down upon an impressive

ROMANESQUE RUIN. Under worklights, dozens of NAZI SOLDIERS

swarm among thick stone walls and archways.

OMIT

EXT. AMONG THE RUINS - NIGHT

A dozen German soldiers swiftly assemble a large steel

MACHINE. The work is monitored by a spindly Nazi in BLACK

LEATHER, his face covered by an odd gas mask: KROENEN.

EXT. NEARBY - BROOM - NIGHT

He lowers a pair of binoculars and passes them to Whitman.

The RADIOMAN cranks a transmitter to life.

EXT. ABBEY RUINS - ALTAR AREA - NIGHT

Kroenen throws a switch: On the machine, dozens of gears

respond!

Steam pistons thrust copper rails upright, lifting two mighty

metal rings, not unlike a gyroscope. Kroenen grunts and

signals for more floodlights to be turned on.

EXT. BEHIND THE ALTAR - NIGHT

The lights flood an ancient sacristy lined with eroded stone

saints. GRIGORY, tall and gaunt, stands naked, arms fully

extended.

ILSA, a severe, ageless Aryan beauty, reverentially drapes

an embroidered robe over his bony shoulders.

He hands her a small LEATHER-BOUND BOOK. It contains hand-

drawn notes and illustrations.

He pulls her close, the clouds of their breath mingling.

He dips his fingers in a wooden bowl full of blood, then

wipes her tears away with a crimson thumb, both a consolation

and a ritual.

VON KRUPT, an acrid German General, wearing dark SCARLET

glasses and LEATHER GLOVES, appears. Looks at his pocket

watch. On the gold lid: a SWASTIKA.

OMIT

EXT. ABBEY RUINS - ALTAR AREA - CEREMONY - NIGHT

Grigory walks towards the machine, its colossal steel and

copper clockworks gleaming in the floodlights.

He strides alongside Grigory and Ilsa, who holds an umbrella

to shield her master from the pouring rain.

Kroenen mutters excitedly as he opens a polished oak box

containing a massive gold and copper MECHA-GLOVE.

Grigory extends his hand so that KROENEN may fit him with

the contraption, which is attached to cables and hoses.

EXT. THE HILLTOP - ALLIED SOLDIERS - NIGHT

The Americans fan out, unseen.

Broom and Whitman dive into a ditch barely in time to avoid

a German foot patrol.

Other GI's take up positions below a machine gun nest.

EXT. ABBEY RUINS - ALTAR AREA - NIGHT

Grigory walks to the top of the altar, cables trailing behind

him.

He looks down at the machine and whispers --

He flexes his fingers and in response --

-- the two metal rings swing around the machine's central

axis. TCHINK!!! WHIRRR!!! STEAM escapes from the ducts and

pipes. An invisible blast of energy forces the falling rain

to swerve momentarily away from Grigory's body.

Ilsa signals TWO NAZI SCIENTISTS standing at a control panel.

One of them inserts a 20 inch SOLID GOLD CYLINDER into the

machine. Two openings remain vacant next to it.

A blade of light opens in the air!

Burning symbols slash the air, like living serpents of fire.

EXT. COSMIC SLIT - NIGHT

The edges of the cosmic slit sizzle with color; an ALIEN

GALAXY sparkles on the other side. Suddenly, a work light

tears loose and flies in.

EXT. COSMIC SLIT - FROM THE OTHER SIDE - NIGHT

The six-foot work light tumbles by the massive OGDRU JAHAD:

seven egg-like monoliths of unholy origin.

Within their translucent walls, horrible creatures lie

slumbering. As the light sweeps by, one of the giants opens

a filmy eye, and then another, and another, and another...

Fleshy tentacles move lazily within their crystalline prison.

EXT. ABBEY RUINS - ALTAR AREA - NIGHT

Grigory screams as his body rises. Veins swell in his neck,

his face distorted by ecstasy and pain.

CLICK. Someone shoots a photograph.

EXT. RUINS - IN THE UNDERBRUSH - NIGHT

It's Matlin, snapping for all he's worth. Whitman pulls him

down and pulls out a large bayonet blade.

Too late. One of the NAZI SCIENTIST has heard them.

EXT. RUINS, IN THE UNDERBRUSH - NIGHT

The Nazi SCIENTIST approaches. Pauses next to the box with

the GOLD CYLINDERS.

EXT. ABBEY RUINS - ALTAR AREA - NIGHT

Grigory dangles like a marionette in a new surge of energy.

Even the skeptical Von Krupt is in thrall.

The NAZI SCIENTIST reaches for a second GOLD CYLINDER. But

something else lands next to him: A GRENADE!!!

The explosion blows him to pieces. In a few seconds, the

squad of Allies storms the area.

A hail of bullets cuts down a dozen Nazis. The Allies overrun

the machine gun nest as grenades explode everywhere.

VON KRUPT shoots wildly, hitting Broom in the leg. But

Whitman's bullets rip into the old Nazi's chest.

Leaving a trail of blood, Broom crawls to a dead G.I. and

grabs a grenade from his belt.

TCHKKK!!! Kroenen extends two gleaming blades from twin steel

bands on his wrists and takes on an entire group of soldiers,

mowing through them with swords spinning like deadly rotors.

The steel chops clean through their weapons.

Broom pulls the pin and throws the grenade at the generator.

CLICK-CLACK!! It wedges itself between two moving tie rods.

Kroenen squeals and -- retracting his blades -- lunges after

it. The gyrating rails slice through his leather jacket. As

his fingers reach the grenade, it EXPLODES!!!

Kroenen flies through the air, hitting a stone wall, where

two long pieces of shrapnel pin him like an insect.

Another rail plunges -- FFFFT!!, like a javelin -- into the

earth right next to MATLIN.

EXT. ABBEY RUINS - ALTAR AREA - NIGHT

Grigory's face is distorted, pulled like ectoplasmic taffy,

his body contorting and breaking. The cosmic portal suddenly

implodes! Nothing is left but a few burnt rails and the metal

glove, empty and smoking.

As the Allies approach, the fighting rages on.

Grigory and Ilsa are gone. And for now, so is Kroenen.

Embedded in the wall where he was pinned, two bloody rails,

nothing more.

OMIT

EXT. INSIDE THE CHURCH - NIGHT

Allied SOLDIERS penetrate the ruins. Matlin helps Broom up.

He picks up a sample of white, viscous goo from the outer

rings of the smoking machine. Whitman approaches.

Broom glances at a 13th century FRESCO depicting heaven and

hell.

EXT. INSIDE CHURCH RUINS - NIGHT

Still raining. A group of soldiers spreads out, using

flashlights to scour through the rubble. Every one of them

has a rosary hanging from the bayonet.

OMIT

EXT. INSIDE CHAPEL RUINS - NIGHT

Broom hastily bandages his bleeding leg. Matlin and Whitman

roam over the debris. Rain POURS through the broken roof.

A rustling sound reaches their ears. Matlin readies a handgun

as Broom scans the walls with his flashlight. Something moves,

accompanied by a loud scrape.

Matlin cocks his pistol and nervously approaches a crumbling

statue. SCREEEECH!!!! A RED THING jumps into the air!!

Instinctively, Matlin shoots at it.

The RED THING leaps from arch to arch, followed by a trail

of bullet hits. Whitman and other soldiers join them --

They hear the labored breathing of a living creature.

Hissing, the thing cowers between a gargoyle and a stone

saint.

WHITMAN points his gun at the scarlet shape above. Broom

stops him from firing.

In deep shadow, the RED THING observes with bright, golden

eyes veined with streaks of burnt sienna.

Broom slowly fishes a BABY RUTH candy bar from his pocket.

Peeling back the wrapper, he slowly waves the candy. The RED

THING shrinks back.

Broom bites into the candy and chews, noisily smacking his

lips. Offers the candy again. This time, out of the dark

comes a small FACE, not very different from the stone demons

around it.

The creature extends its right arm: it's solid stone with

tiny runes engraved around the thick, cylindrical wrist.

Four articulated stone fingers wiggle, reaching for the

chocolate.

Whitman moves closer. On the wall behind him, a shadow shows

the RED THING climbing into Broom's arms.

Broom tenderly covers it with a blanket. The stubby fingers

snatch the candy. Broom smiles.

EXT. CHAPEL RUINS - NIGHT

The soldiers cluster around, curious to see it. Matlin

prepares his camera and directs them into a group shot. Broom

smiles like a proud new father and embraces the creature,

patting him gently. CLICK!!!

INT. DARKROOM - BACK TO INTERVIEW 1

Matlin finally pulls an old 8x10 from a battered portfolio.

He smiles, full of memories.

EXT. INSIDE THE CHURCH - BACK TO '44 - NIGHT

Inside the blanket, Hellboy blinks his bright golden eyes

and chews candy, his devilish red tail twitching happily.

HELLBOY - MAIN TITLE

Montage: Tabloid covers and news clippings screaming HELLBOY

SIGHTING IN RENO!! GOVERNMENT DENIAL!!! etc.

TV Newscasters read lurid copy. SPRINGER excerpts (fist fight

included) feature the show's theme: I WAS HELLBOY'S BRIDE!!

Some blurry, grainy footage depicts Hellboy crossing an alley.

Much like Bigfoot in the woods.

INT. STUDIO T.V. HOST SHOW - INTERVIEW #2 - DAY

MANNING is a balding, official-looking guy in a suit.

SUPER ON TV:

Manning on a TV SHOW a la Regis Philbin.

He shows a blurry picture.

The audience applauds.

EXT. HIGH MOUNTAINS, EASTERN EUROPE - DAY

In the thick of a snowstorm, THREE FIGURES climb the icy

steps of a massive rock formation.

Super: BIRGAU PASS, MOLDAVIA, PRESENT DAY.

EXT. HIGH MOUNTAINS (SET), EASTERN EUROPE - DAY

The THREE FIGURES move through a narrow passage until they

reach a DEAD END.

FIGURE 1 stops at a symbol carved in the rocky ground and

consults Grigory's LEATHER-BOUND BOOK. The symbol matches an

illustration in the book.

Before them, a thick wall of ice. Using a heavy steel hammer,

FIGURE 1 breaks through.

Figure 2 produces two small GOLD INGOTS. Hands one to the

guide. Keeps the other one.

The Guide examines his pay greedily: engraved in it: a

SWASTIKA.

INT. ICE CAVE - SMALL CORRIDOR - DAY

The ice curtain collapses, revealing a rough-walled corridor.

FIGURE 1 spots a glowing firefly. They follow it into --

INT. ICE CAVE - MAIN NAVE - DAY

A cathedral-like vault that could easily hold a stadium.

From an opening somewhere above, eerie blue light streams

down on a magnificent labyrinth.

A few more fireflies speckle the air, winking on and off.

INT. ICE CAVE - LABYRINTH - DAY

The THREE FIGURES move past cyclopean statues guarding the

inhuman architecture. The humans are dwarfed by the monumental

scale of the walkways and ramparts.

INT. ICE CAVE - CENTRAL LABYRINTH AREA - DAY

At the center of the labyrinth the stone floor is covered in

grooves radiating from a shallow stone basin.

FIGURE 3 uncovers his face: he's a PEASANT GUIDE.

FIGURE 1 exchanges a meaningful look with FIGURE 2. FIGURE 1

throws two solid gold pieces at the feet of the Sherpa. On

them, an embossed SWASTIKA. After a greedy moment of thought,

the Peasant kneels to pick up the gold.

TCHKK!!! A long, shiny blade pierces the Peasant's chest

from behind. He blinks twice and slumps forward.

FIGURE 2 steps out from behind him, a long, bloody blade in

his hand.

The figures uncover their faces. ILSA has not aged and

KROENEN, still wears the same tight gas mask. He cleans his

blade in the snow and takes back the gold.

Ilsa watches the Sherpa's blood as it runs in a steaming

rivulet, tracing a glyph in the grooves and filling the basin.

A FIGURE RISES FROM THE BLOOD. A naked human shape, haloed

by fireflies.

INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

Mechanized rollers transport X-Ray films over a backlit

screen. A group of 4 DOCTORS studies the pictures and

exchanges somber looks. Rain spatters the windows.

Doctor 1 glances at the others.

Doctor 2 looks through a glass partition at an aged but

dignified BROOM, 72, who slowly buttons his shirt. Hanging

from his wrist, his rosary.

INT. DOCTORS OFFICE - EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY

Broom impassively takes in the information.

Broom pensively shuffles his tarot cards.

Broom looks down: first card off the deck: DEATH.

EXT. N.Y. - MANHATTAN STREET - DAY

Leaves stir on the pavement. All the stores are decorated

for Halloween. Two kids dressed as SKELETONS run in front of

Broom, carrying a JACK-O-LANTERN.

Leaning on a cane, Broom exits the building and walks toward

a waiting black Mercedes. The DRIVER (Agent Lime) opens the

door.

Broom pauses to buy a dozen BABY RUTH candy bars from a street

vendor.

In an ELECTRONICS STORE, a wall of TV's. The image of a RED,

BLURRY SHAPE (HELLBOY) fills the screens.

Broom smiles.

OMIT

EXT. B.P.R.D. BUILDING COMPLEX - DAY

On a wooded, new jersey hill, a low-slung, high-tech complex

rests at the edge of a bluff, its foundation fused with the

rock below.

SUPER: BUREAU FOR PARANORMAL RESEARCH AND DEFENSE, NEWARK,

N.J.

EXT. B.P.R.D. COMPLEX - GATE ENTRANCE - DAY

A dolled-up MOD-STYLE moped stops at the massive gate.

Strapped to the luggage rack are two cheap suitcases. The

driver, a very wet YOUNG MAN named MYERS, touches an old

fashioned buzzer under a sign reading "WASTE MANAGEMENT"

A crackling INTERCOM VOICE answers.

A beat, then -- WHIRRR!!! An EYEPIECE and an LCD screen

scanner pop out.

Myers looks into the eyepiece. On the screen, Myers' cornea

is scanned. TWO VIOLET FLASHES. His ID and badge numbers

appear. CLACK! The gate opens.

EXT. UPHILL ROAD - THE MOPED - DAY

The moped putt-putts towards the building in the distance.

INT. B.P.R.D. LOBBY - DAY

Seated at a dramatic circular desk is a solitary guard. Myers

approaches.

Confused, Myers picks up his suitcases and complies. He

realizes he's DEAD CENTER on a giant B.P.R.D. Logo: A HAND

HOLDING A SWORD.

Immediately, the floor under Myers' feet starts down. He's

on a small elevator.

INT./EXT. OPEN ELEVATOR - ON THE WAY DOWN - DAY

The panel overhead slides shut. A row of safety lights comes

on.

INT. OPEN ELEVATOR - DAY

He's in a vast underground area with other elevators moving

up and down in the distance.

INT. B.P.R.D. - CONCRETE CHAMBER 51 - DUSK

The elevator stops in a narrow, dark space. Neon lights

flicker on, illuminating a circular chamber. PAINTED on the

floor is a huge number: 51.

Right in front of Myers: a magnificent oak door.

Myers knocks on it. No answer. Myers enters.

INT. BROOM S OFFICE (FULL AQUARIUM)- DUSK

Myers looks around, fascinated: books. An office made of

them. The soft glow of green-shaded reading lamps bathes

everything in an intimate, warm light.

One entire wall is a thick pane of glass, the wall of a huge

tank of water. A VOICE crackles through an intercom next to

the tank.

Myers jumps, then moves closer to the glass.

In the tank, ABE SAPIEN, a FISH-MAN glides in and out view.

Myers looks at four BOOK STANDS facing the glass. Each

supports an open volume. He leans close to the glass, peering

intently.

Abe reappears. He is slender, dolphin gray, with dark patterns

streaking his soft skin. Bright blue eyes shine with

intelligence. Behind a thin wound-like mouth, gills are

bubbling.

Abe nods. Through a side door, Broom enters.

Myers extends his hand in greeting --

BAM! Abe presses his webbed hand against the glass, closes

his eyes -- all three lids.

Abe's voice surges from the speaker.

Points at a small piece of antique paper, framed on the wall.

Broom uncovers a tray by the tank: Four greenish eggs. Myers

gags and reels back.

Abe smiles and takes a subaquatic bow, gracefully nabbing

the eggs as they float through the hatch.

OMIT

INT. B.P.R.D. - FREAK CORRIDOR "A" - NIGHT

Myers and Broom walk down a corridor. The walls are lined

with glass cases containing occult artifacts. Myers eyes a

MUMMIFIED HAND, a CLAY GOLEM, a sumptuous PAGAN ALTAR...

He points to an ANCIENT, BROKEN LANCE.

He gestures at an ancient LANCE. Next to it: a silver and

gold reliquary.

They go through a series of pneumatic doors.

Workmen are replacing two of the doors. Big dents from an

oversized fist have deformed the 2-inch thick metal plates.

Myers stares.

They reach a FINAL DOOR. Stainless steel, like a BANK VAULT.

Waiting there is AGENT CLAY, a burly guy in a suit, with a

cartful of BEEF AND MASHED POTATOES. A dinner pile at least

4 feet high.

Broom hands Myers two BABY RUTH bars and walks away.

Broom signals "no."

The door closes behind him.

Myers nods.

Clay uses an odd-shaped ELECTRONIC KEY to unlock the door.

Three solenoid locks turn. Two steel vertical PISTONS open

up.

INT. HELLBOY'S DEN - NIGHT

Clay pushes the cart into a solid concrete bunker, windowless,

austere except for a few SAMURAI suits of ARMOR and WEAPONS.

Dozens of CATS wander around; others are curled up on the

furniture.

There are Zippo's everywhere, from every era.

On a sofa (made from the bed of a pickup truck) is a heap of

blankets and comic books. All in all, a MEGA BACHELOR PAD.

Clay points at a torn comic book: HELLBOY, THE UNCANNY. Myers

picks it up, looks at the cover: it shows Hellboy -- in a

U.S. Uniform, fighting a monstrous ape.

Myers watches, amazed, as a bright red TAIL waves in and out

of a pool of light about ten feet away. One of the cats

playfully paws at it.

The voice is a deep baritone, chesty and powerful.

Myers gasps, seeing a monumental figure in the shadows,

exercising with a 300 lb. Stainless steel DUMBBELL. Crimson

biceps like cooked hams. Chomping an unlit CIGAR stub.

Agent Clay blushes as he hides his scalp.

On a nearby pile of junked TV sets, a loop of Fleischer

cartoons and home movies cycles endlessly. One subject appears

over and over: an ATTRACTIVE YOUNG WOMAN with a pale face

and raven-black hair.

BANG!!! Hellboy lets the dumbbell drop. Instinctively, Myers

jumps.

Myers remembers he's holding the Baby Ruths.

Hellboy finally enters the light. He's awe-inspiring, with

chiseled features, patterned red skin and deep-set golden

eyes. Involuntarily, Myers recoils.

In spite of himself, Myers is staring at the horn stumps.

An ALARM sounds, and a red light blinks on the wall. Myers

looks around, bewildered.

EXT. MACHEN LIBRARY - NIGHT

An imposing four-story structure, all pillars and pediments.

A HALLOWEEN BANNER advertises: MAGICK: THE ANCIENT POWER.

Super: THE MACHEN LIBRARY, MANHATTAN

Chaos near the entrance: policemen, TV reporters, MOUNTED

POLICE.

Loud protests from the reporters as a line of black sedan

cars are waved through.

Trailing behind the cars, a GARBAGE TRUCK. On its side a

mirrored sign reads: SQUEAKY CLEAN INC. Waste Management

Services.

INT./EXT. GARBAGE TRUCK - LIBRARY STREET ENTRANCE - NIGHT

AN AGENT is driving the truck, with MYERS at his side.

EXT. MACHEN LIBRARY - STREET ENTRANCE - NIGHT

The crowd parts like the Red Sea for the garbage truck. Dozens

of faces are reflected in the truck's mirrored logo. A MOUNTED

POLICEMAN rides past the mirrored sides of the truck.

INT./EXT. GARBAGE TRUCK LAB - LIBRARY CROWD - NIGHT

The MOUNTED POLICEMAN is visible as he rides by. The mirrors

are see-through. The back of the truck is a fully-equipped

crime lab, crammed with hi-tech gear and low-tech talismans.

ABE fits a respirator over his face. It looks like a

mechanized Elizabethan collar. Valves bubble and hiss as he

inhales liquid through his mouth and out his gills.

Hellboy looks out onto the CROWD.

Hellboy straps on a huge utility belt heavy with amulets,

rosaries, horseshoes. From an ashtray he grabs a handful of

stogie stubs. Lights one, puts the rest in a pouch.

Hellboy unlocks a STEEL BOX (STENCILED ON ITS LID: "THE GOOD

SAMARITAN") and extracts the meanest-looking, custom-built,

double-barrel, blue-finished, handgun ever made. A veritable

cannon.

EXT. COURTYARD / LOADING DOCK MACHEN LIBRARY - NIGHT

The GARBAGE TRUCK pulls into an interior courtyard and stops.

FBI/BPRD teams spread through the area, expelling uniformed

cops and securing the doors.

THREE AGENTS -- QUARRY, STONE and MOSS -- close a gate,

sealing off the area.

From a nearby roof, Agent Lime signals all clear.

The truck stops, Clay pulls a lever. Myers watches as the

dumpster loader hinges down like a drawbridge, revealing

HELLBOY and ABE.

Abe, Clay and Hellboy activate lights on their belts. They

BEEP and blink. Hellboy starts walking.

OMIT

INT. MACHEN LIBRARY, MAIN LOBBY - NIGHT

As BPRD agents clear the area, Clay, Myers, Abe and Hellboy

march through the main lobby. On view, various display cases.

Two BANNERS flank the marble staircase.

Broom stands at the base of the marble staircase.

Myers observes as the red Goliath sheepishly averts his gaze

from that of the fragile old man.

INT. MAIN CORRIDOR / MACHEN LIBRARY (SET) - NIGHT

They approach an oversize set of brass doors.

Abe removes a leather glove from his hand. FWAP!! he spreads

his webbed fingers on the door. He closes his three eyelids

and concentrates.

Two agents arrive with a rolling munitions case. Myers

observes as Hellboy opens it and looks over a potpourri of

bullets of all colors and shapes.

Hellboy selects a clip full of bullets and a speed loader.

Abe quickly starts scanning a few leather-bound volumes of

ancient magic.

As HELLBOY opens the big doors, a flickering amber glow

illuminates him. He steps inside.

INT. "MAGIK EXHIBITION" HALL - NIGHT

BLUE emergency lamps are on. The exhibits are destroyed;

piles of debris are burning. Hellboy walks past a fallen

display case.

He moves around cautiously. A couple of large carvings and

statues startle him.

On the floor: boots, half chewed. Bitten belts and shreds of

uniforms and hats.

The sickening sound of snapping bones and mastication reaches

his ears. Hellboy reacts to a smell, raises his eyes to

discover --

A huge pale CREATURE hangs from the ceiling, chewing slowly.

SAMMAEL: equipped with powerful arms, a head full of tentacles

and two well-muscled hind legs. Most of its face is hidden,

but the jaws are shiny with blood.

INT. MAIN CORRIDOR / MACHEN LIBRARY (SET) - NIGHT

Abe has found a small, medieval engraving of Sammael in one

of the books.

INT. "MAGIK EXHIBITION" HALL - NIGHT

Sammael releases himself, lands on the floor. Part of the

neck is exposed: white, slimy skin, cracked like old marble

and criss- crossed with blue veins.

Sammael stands and turns around -- CRACK-KKK!!! His waist

twists him 360 degrees!!

Screeching, Sammael leaps away!!!

Hellboy shoots. The high-caliber ammo rips a few columns

apart and finally catches Sammael. The bullet goes through

it and destroys a statue and a large window behind him. The

monster squeals and goes down. With a rattling cough, it

grows still.

OMIT

INT. MACHEN LIBRARY - MAGIK EXHIBIT HALL - NIGHT

Hellboy turns away for a moment. Puts his gun away, like a

gunslinger.

INT. MACHEN LIBRARY - EXHIBIT CORRIDOR DOORS - NIGHT

INT. MACHEN LIBRARY - MAGIK EXHIBIT HALL - NIGHT

Hellboy looks back at the corpse: it's gone!

BAMMM!! From out of nowhere, Sammael appears and swings an

arm!! Hellboy CRASHES into the brass doors!

INT. MACHEN LIBRARY - EXHIBIT CORRIDORS - NIGHT

The doors bulge and crack under Hellboy's impact.

Abe and Broom backpedal fast. Myers pulls out his gun, and

starts looking for another way in. Broom observes this,

pleased.

INT. MACHEN LIBRARY - MAGIK EXHIBIT HALL - NIGHT

Sammael lashes out with a massive punch.

HELLBOY goes K-KKRASH!!! K-KKRASH!!! through SIX glass

cabinets, then hits a window, falling --

EXT. AN ALLEY - BEHIND MACHEN LIBRARY - NIGHT

-- two stories down, landing sideways in an industrial garbage

bin. Hellboy fights to stay conscious. Blood drips from his

mouth

Hellboy looks up: standing in the alley, like an apparition,

is Grigory, in a black suit and overcoat, his eyes shielded

by pitch-black sunglasses

Hellboy's in shock, confused.

Hellboy catches sight of his big gun, lying on the ground.

He goes for it but, BAMMM!!!! SAMMAEL lands before him.

Before Hellboy can reach the weapon --

WSHHHP!!! A 7-foot tongue lashes out from Sammael's mouth

like a whip. It's arm-thick, with yellow sacs billowing from

its sides. It wraps around Hellboy's right arm.

Hellboy falls to the ground, writhing, grinding his teeth.

The tongue squeezes and pulls. Smoke pours from Hellboy's

skin.

EXT. AN ALLEY - BEHIND MACHEN LIBRARY - NIGHT

Then -- BANG! BANG! BANG! Myers appears at the end of the

alley, firing round after round into Sammael's tongue. AMBER

BLOOD explodes in the air. The tongue recoils with an infernal

SQUEAL!!

Hellboy manages to roll away.

Myers goes for HELLBOY's gun... and grabs it! He takes cover

behind the trash container. HELLBOY is there.

Myers proudly shows him the gun.

He grabs his gun and tries to reload, but his arm hurts too

much.

He hands him the gun and a fresh clip. Reaching into his

belt, Hellboy extracts a vacuum-sealed packet.

In the packet: A SINGLE BULLET.

KLANG!!! The tongue punches through the steel like a ramrod.

Again and again... Hellboy and Myers can barely dodge it.

Myers cracks a safety pin. The glass head on the bullet glows

like a chemical flare.

He's looking at Hellboy's smoking arm. Inside a bloody gash,

a big, black stinger is gleaming.

Hellboy pulls it out, then steps on it. It pops like a ripe

grape.

Hellboy steps from behind the container. Sammael's tongue

instantly wraps around the gun's muzzle.

BAM! BAM! Hellboy shoots repeatedly. His face lit weirdly

green as the tracking bullet lodges within the gun. Then --

BAM!!!!

INSIDE GUN SHOT

The glowing bullet flies through the barrel and out towards --

EXT. ALLEY

-- Sammael, still in mid-air.

It hits him square in the chest: an explosion of green goo!!

With a shriek, the thing leaps over a wall. Hellboy scrambles

after it.

EXT. LOADING ALLEY - NIGHT

On the empty sidewalk, Hellboy sees a trail of GLOWING GOOP.

He hits full stride, following it around a corner. Myers

lands a second later, cradling his arm, chasing after him.

LOADING DOCK / ALLEY

Sammael dashes by, followed closely by Hellboy, running full

tilt.

A ten-wheeler backs up, effectively blocking their way. A

few workers load pumpkin boxes in it.

Without slowing down, Sammael jumps onto the trailer, denting

the roof then jumping off and into a CROWDED CARNIVAL area.

A small carrousel and refreshment stand flank a pumpkin patch.

Full of curiosity, Sammael pauses a second to inspect a Trick-

or-treater dressed as a GOLDEN DRAGON.

Hellboy catapults himself onto the trailer's roof.

Hellboy jumps and lands heavily on top of the driver's cab:

CRASH!!!

The driver is almost crushed under the steel. He screams,

showered by thousands of glass shards.

Myers is a few steps behind.

He squeezes between the vehicle and the alley wall. The

vendors are yelling at him.

EXT. WEST SIDE STREET - NIGHT

Sammael runs past a group of trick-or-treaters, and jumps

straight into the street. Cars swerve, avoiding a collision

as Sammael lands on the opposite sidewalk. The TRICK OR

TREATERS scream.

Hellboy appears. He too dives straight into the traffic as

Myers follows --

He runs into the road... and a 4X4 speeds straight at him!

Seeing this, Hellboy runs back, and lands next to Myers,

holds out his STONE HAND and stops the 4x4 dead in its tracks.

The impact somersaults the car over them both. It lands with

a thud on the street, air bags exploding. Myers almost faints.

Other cars stop, tires squealing and horns blaring. A major

traffic jam.

Myers opens his eyes, nods.

He moves after Sammael.

OMIT

EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

Hellboy follows the GLOWING GOOP into an adjacent alley. At

the far end he sees a metal grate has been moved. Sammael's

gone.

He comes up to the opening, then jumps in.

EXT./INT. STUNT TRACKS TUNNEL - NIGHT

He lands on a subway track. Sammael is a few yards away.

Seated.

A train horn blares. A headlight approaches!! Hellboy smiles

and puts away his gun.

But Sammael sprints towards it!

Sammael unhinges a long, scythe-like bone from his forearm,

then jumps at the front car --

OMIT

INT. STUNT TRACKS / FRONT 1/4 CAR - NIGHT

smashing through glass and steel and raining sparks. Landing

inside with a ROAR!!! --

EXT./INT. THE SUBWAY - 2 TRAIN CAR SET - NIGHT

SAMMAEL's tongue punches through the doors as he races through

one -- two -- passenger cars and out the --

STUNT TRACK REAR 1/4 CAR

-- rear of the train, back onto the tracks.

INT. STUNT  TRACKS - NIGHT

Landing there safely.

INT. THE SUBWAY TRACKS (STUNT TRACK) - NIGHT

Now the train hurtles at Hellboy, who grimaces and does his

best --

INT. STUNT TRACKS FRONT 1/4 CAR

He leaps, but HUMPF!! He's hit! His legs rattle over the

tracks.

INT. UNDERCARRIAGE - STUNT TRACKS - FRONT 1/4 CAR - NIGHT

Inches from the wheels, he punches his stone hand through

the steel floor and grabs a handhold. Steam and sparks explode

everywhere.

The TRAIN DRIVER grabs a fire extinguisher and starts slamming

it against Hellboy's head.

BAMMM!!! He goes under!!!

INT. STUNT TRACKS FRONT 1/4 CAR

The train whizzes overhead, grazing his horn stumps, making

sparks fly!! After the train passes, Hellboy sits up, forehead

smoking. Sammael is gone. A trail of GOOP is glowing. He

follows it, until it ends abruptly.

He looks ahead: no trace of Sammael... Then a fat drop of

glowing goop hits his hand.

He looks up. Sammael hangs from the ceiling, then drops.

Then the creature lifts Hellboy in a ferocious bear hug.

Hellboy twists around and cracks open the jaws of the

creature, like King Kong and the T-Rex.

Sammael staggers back and -- in an impossible maneuver, re-

knits his jaws together! Then he uses his bone scythe to

tackle Hellboy and -- TCHAKKKK!! -- pin his shoulder down. A

deep wound.

Sammael's mouth starts to open! Hellboy looks at the sparking

THIRD RAIL a few feet away.

Sammael's tongue rears back, a snake ready to strike.

Hellboy grabs the rail. An electrical discharge consumes

both creatures and burns the frame like flashpaper. Hellboy

lets go, his hand and body smoking. Sammael -- very crispy --

is convulsing in a cloud of smoke. He grows still.

Wreathed in smoke, Hellboy shakes off the shock and uses a

flame on his arm to light a cigar.

OMIT

EXT. WESTSIDE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

A huge traffic jam clogs the highway. The totalled 4X4 is

being TOWED AWAY. Several TV CREWS interview witnesses.

Myers -- his arm freshly bandaged -- signs a police form.

His radio beeps.

Myers moves away from the POLICE OFFICERS.

INT. SUBWAY TRACKS (STUNT TRACK)

Hellboy walks away from the smoking Sammael carcass.

EXT. WESTSIDE HIGHWAY - SAME

INT. SUBWAY TRACKS (STUNT TRACK)

He turns off his belt locator and moves away into the darkness

of the tunnel.

In the foreground: BLACK light escapes from Sammael's charred

body.

INT. MAIN ABANDONED BATHS ALCOVE - NIGHT

An abandoned shower room. A series of sinks and stalls, lined

with dirty white tile. A phonograph nearby plays Wagner.

Kroenen stands next to it.

ILSA is nearby, a straight razor glinting in her hand. She

stands over Grigory -- his back to us -- lovingly shaving

her master's scalp. She grabs two GLASS EYES from a table.

Places them in Grigory's sockets -- his back to us -- as he

turns, a glass eye shifts lazily into position. He opens his

hand: in it the pale BLACK light that escaped from Sammael's

body. He cradles it like a precious stone.

He closes his fist.

Rasputin stands, his neck and shoulders rising, engorged by

moving flesh beneath his human skin. Ilsa stares in

fascination.

Behind him, in the darkness of a tunnel: TWO SAMMAEL

silhouettes appear.

OMIT

EXT. MACHEN LIBRARY ENTRANCE - NIGHT

A sleek black limo drives past the crowd and stops outside.

FBI agent TOM MANNING emerges.

INT. "MAGIK EXHIBIT" HALL - NIGHT

Manning and Broom walk through the mess. A crew is cleaning

up. The dead guards are carried out.

Manning moistens and lights a fine cigar, using a kitchen

match.

ABE SAPIEN listens while pacing the exhibition hall, palm

open.

Manning watches as Abe finds a sharp dagger embedded in the

floor.

Abe silences him.

Abe holds the dagger in his hand, turns to Broom.

Broom examines the dagger: a RAGNAROK symbol crowns the hilt.

The dragon and swastika.

He solemnly extends his hand. As soon as Abe takes it, the

room...

INT. "MAGIK EXHIBIT" HALL - FLASHBACK

Hours earlier: the place is intact. Both ABE and BROOM witness

spectrally as --

A GUARD CHECKS AN ALARM MONITORING UNIT. HEARING A ticking

sound, he shines his light into a dark corner: no one's there.

But after the guard moves on, a spidery form emerges from

the pool of shadows on the floor.

It's KROENEN, encased in shiny BLACK LATEX from head to toe.

On his chest, a close-fitting harness comprised of softly

ticking gears.

He approaches a glass case which holds an ancient WOODEN

STATUE of an Eastern Orthodox SAINT.

Then, on the glass, a reflection: ILSA.

She uses her hammer to destroy the glass case.

The ALARM shrieks. Warning lights come on.

Kroenen pulls out a double-ended BLADE. It spins, like a

giant bone saw, slicing across the statue.

No apparent damage until: CRACKKKKK!!! a diagonal line appears

and the top half falls.

KROENEN reaches for a small crank embedded in his chest and

winds himself up.

Ilsa reaches into a hollow portion in the wooden statue and

removes a large reliquary jar containing Golden sand.

Six guards hurry in. They point their flashlights and guns

at Kroenen.

Kroenen starts shaking, as if in a seizure and readies two

TWIN BLADES.

bullet tears into Kroenen's arm, spewing forth an explosion

of dust. He turns. The guards shoot again. Kroenen maneuvers

the steel, deflecting the bullets which --

-- ricochet wildly -- and finally hit three of the guards.

They fall silently to the floor.

Kroenen dispatches two more in a flurry of knives.

The last guard raises his gun.

Something is clearly stopping him. His hand breaks, twisted

by an unseen force!!

The flesh on his neck pushes upwards, held by an invisible

force. He starts floating in mid-air.

The blinking lights of arriving police cars tint the windows

red and amber. They outline a figure formerly submerged in

shadows. GRIGORY. He gestures with both hands, as if holding

an imaginary doll.

His arm muscles twitch under his skin, shifting, changing,

gaining strength.

With a quick gesture Grigory twists the lower and upper parts

of the guard's body in opposite directions.

With a wet CRUNCH, the guard's shadow on the wall goes limp.

Grigory looks at Ilsa.

Ilsa opens the reliquary jar and pours a circle of sand onto

the floor.

Grigory slices the air with his open hand, creating fleeting

glyphs... and a small BLACK flame dances on his open palm.

He deposits it in mid-air, at the center of the circle.

Then, the sand begins to move, like liquid mercury. Lines

fuse into a pile. It melts and bubbles, growing and foaming.

Bones are formed, tendons and ligaments join together,

GROWING, GROWING, INTO SAMMAEL.

It roars!!!

OMIT

INT. MACHEN LIBRARY - NIGHT

Abe snaps out of it. Broom is pale. He steps away, wincing,

enduring a bolt of pain in his side. Abe holds him. Motions

for the others to stay back.

He extends his open palm and "feels" the air near the old

man's back.

Broom turns around, gently pushes Abe's hand away.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT

A small nighttime Halloween celebration. Lanterns hanging

from the trees, couples drinking and listening to Pop music

on picnic tables.

On a bench, A YOUNG GUY pulls out a cold SIX PACK of beer

and passionately kisses his GIRLFRIEND. As he shuts his eyes,

a bright, red tail neatly snatches the six-pack.

Behind the bench, HELLBOY smiles.

EXT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Dry leaves fly up in a gust of wind. A small army of EMERGENCY

VEHICLES roars down the deserted streets, right past a...

...brick 1940's HOSPITAL, behind a high wall topped with

barbed wire. The mesh-covered windows are decorated with

paper skeletons and jack-o'-lanterns. A topiary garden

surrounds the building.

Watching from atop the wall is HELLBOY. One sleeve of his

overcoat is soaked in blood. He keeps an eye on the SECOND

FLOOR windows. Hanging from his tail: THE SIX PACK OF BEER.

INT. BELLAMIE MENTAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

DOCTOR MARSH, a female psychiatrist, moves down a line

patients, distributing pills.

Behind her, a lithe young woman in a patient's gown carries

the medicine tray. This is LIZ SHERMAN, age 26, her pale

skin contrasting with her raven-black hair and piercing dark

eyes. A scar mars her forehead. Three thick rubber bands

circle her wrist.

Near a window, a Down's Syndrome PATIENT senses something.

Hearing this, Liz stops. She closes her eyes, tugs at one of

the rubber bands on her wrist and lets it snap against her

skin. She winces and peers out the window. The garden below

seems empty.

EXT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - GARDEN AREA - NIGHT

Liz steps out a side door into the hospital garden. Hanging

from her neck: an old POLAROID CAMERA. She follows a trail

of blood to a large, thorny bush. As she circles it...

Visible in the branches, a leg and part of Hellboy's overcoat.

His tail emerges, dangling the six-pack.

Liz shoots a Polaroid.

Shyly, he climbs out from the bush. She sees the bloody arm.

Liz sighs.

EXT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - GARDEN AREA- NIGHT

Hellboy's sitting on a bench, next to Liz.

Around her right hand a faint BLUE AURA of fire blooms,

crawling over her fingers like a velvet haze. She stares at

the pale flame.

She clenches her fist and puts the flame out.

The garbage truck and the two black sedan cars have pulled

into the hospital grounds. A dozen agents climb out of the

vehicles.

ANGLE - THE CARS - CONTINUOUS

Clay starts towards Hellboy, but Myers stops him and turns

to Broom:

ANGLE - THE BENCH - CONTINUOUS

Liz stands up, puts her hand on his shoulder.

Hellboy smiles sadly. She walks away.

She doesn't turn back.

Feeling light-headed, he stands up. On the bench and at his

feet, a pool of his own blood.

He sees Myers tentatively approaching.

Hellboy drops to his knees. Clay, Quarry and Moss reach him.

Help him up.

Liz stands at the hospital door and sees Hellboy keel over.

A few of the agents help him to the vehicles.

Myers looks back at Liz. They hold each others' gaze, their

unfamiliar faces filled with curiosity. Eventually, she goes

inside.

OMIT

INT. B.P.R.D. MEDICAL BAY "A" - NIGHT

In the depths of the B.P.R.D infirmary, Hellboy lies flat on

a stainless steel table. Broom sits alongside him.

Abe peers through a magnifier at Hellboy's wounded arm.

Using a scalpel, Abe probes the gash. Hellboy lets out a

GRUNT.

Broom moves to Abe's side of the table. Abe is poking at the

depths of the wound.

Broom comes closer, eyes wide: inside the wound on Hellboy's

forearm, nestled like ticks, are 3 translucent EGGS.

Hellboy jumps as Abe plucks the first one out. Abe deposits

it in a glass container.

INT. MEDICAL BAY. EXAMINATION TABLE - LATER

The computer beeps having finished an analysis. On a monitor,

an enlarged color image of one of the throbbing eggs.

Abe picks up an egg with a pair of tweezers, passes it on to

Hellboy, who sports a bandage on his arm.

Broom frowns, worried.

Myers observes, repelled, as inside the egg a small foetal

THING wiggles.

INT. BROOM S OFFICE - NIGHT

Myers stands by Broom's desk as the old man places a new set

of books on the reading stands in front of the fish tank.

At the last book stand, Broom glances at Abe, who is sitting

in the shadows near the door.

Discouraged, Myers heads for the door.

Shocked, Myers looks over at Broom.

OMIT

INT. B.R.P.D. ARCHIVE / CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

Dozens of HELLBOY clippings flash by: tabloid headlines along

with intimate images of Hellboy as a KID. H.B. at 7, at 12,

dressed as a human for Halloween, Broom by his side.

Myers works at a computer workstation.

He brings up a small photograph in an old issue of The

Enquirer. The headline: "ARSON SUSPECT NOW WORKING FOR SECRET

GOVERNMENT AGENCY" There's a photo of a woman, taken with a

telephoto lens.

Another clipping: young LIZ, 11, and a photo of a tenement

building burned to the ground: TRAGIC EXPLOSION.

A QUICKTIME interview pops up. LIZ, in her early twenties. A

caption reads: ELIZABETH SHERMAN, first interview, BPRD,

PYROKINETIC. She has a POLAROID camera in her hands. Shoots

one at the lens.

OMIT

INT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Two strolling ORDERLIES shine their flashlights inside the

rooms on both sides of a long corridor.

INT. HOSPITAL - LIZ'S ROOM, MIN. SECURITY WARD - NIGHT

A flashlight beam sweeps Liz's room. It illuminates a

CORKBOARD covered with hundreds of Polaroids depicting scenes

of everyday life.

When the beam of light crosses her face, she turns slowly,

still asleep.

As the light fades, the shadows in the room grow deeper.

Grigory emerges from a dark corner. He gazes down on the

bed, extending his right hand.

He gently caresses the scar on her forehead. Under his skin,

a hideous movement, a writhing rearrangement of muscles. His

fingers start to glow.

Liz convulses. A small ripple of heat rises from her forehead.

EXT. TENEMENT BUILDING COURTYARD - DAY

Somewhere in a smokestack city, grown-ups and kids hang

banners and prepare a ragged birthday party in a cement

courtyard.

ANGLE - LIZ - CONTINUOUS

Sitting on some tenement steps, LIZ, age 11. Sullen, alone,

a gold CRUCIFIX hanging on her chest.

A WOMAN -- Liz's MOTHER -- comes down the courtyard steps,

carrying a basket of apples.

Nearby, under a balloon archway, munching candy-coated

apples... three KIDS giggle and point at her.

Liz turns to see them.

Liz shies away from them.

They start throwing stones. One hits the steps. Another misses

her by inches. A third hits her in the shoulder.

Scared, Liz turns but a rock catches her full on the face.

She falls down, blood trickling from her forehead, splattering

the pavement. She starts sobbing. Another rock sails across,

but this time, in mid-air, it catches fire and turns to ash.

A ripple of heat starts crawling up Liz's hands. Soon a pale

blue flame rings her entire arm.

Firelight glints off the crucifix.

EXT. TENEMENT COURTYARD - DAY

MOTHER is dunking the apples in a pot of caramel. A

heartbreaking cry reaches her ears.

Mother sees...

EXT. TENEMENT COURTYARD - STEPS -  DAY

Liz: outlined by licking flames!

Mother screams, horrified.

She then explodes. A white-hot supernova engulfs the

courtyard. Her mother's body burns like flash paper. Then

the rest of the people are --

THE ENTIRE TENEMENT COURTYARD

-- devoured by an explosion of atomic proportions. Benches,

people, trees. Everything. The four surrounding apartment

blocks collapse as a shock wave hits like a wrecking ball.

The frame whites out. And at ground zero there is but one

figure left standing:

Liz... a little girl, still crying.

INT. BELLAMIE HOSP. - LIZ'S ROOM, MIN. SEC. WARD - NIGHT

Liz screams, her back arching, her body now in flames. Her

chest glows, silhouetting organs and ribs.

The rubber bands on her wrist vaporize.

INT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - MIN. SEC. WARD - NIGHT

The glow from Liz's room streams into the corridor.

INT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT

In their glass kiosk, two ORDERLIES are listening to the

radio and sharing a pizza. A red light flashes repeatedly on

a panel.

They silence the radio, grab their batons and get up. A low

rumble shakes the room.

Through the VIBRATING glass window they see...

CORRIDOR MINIATURE / COMPOSITE

...A BALL OF FLAME pushing inexorably through the corridor.

The inside of the glass booth is absolutely silent, making

the vision both terrifying and strangely serene.

INT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - SECURITY ROOM (SET)- NIGHT

As the glass explodes, the fire ROARS, drowning everything.

The orderlies hit the floor, taking cover under a shelf.

EXT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL (MINIATURE) - NIGHT

The top floor blows up. Flame pours out of every window,

showering glass into the streets below.

INT. B.P.R.D. - FREAK CORRIDOR "A" - DAY

Myers pushes the breakfast cart. On it, three dozen pancakes

and a mound of bacon and toast.

He opens the door to Hellboy s den.

INT. HELLBOY'S DEN - DAY

Inside, Hellboy is leaning over Broom, glaring at the old

man.

Myers enters, deliberately clearing his throat. They ignore

him.

Broom grows silent.

Hellboy stomps over to a mirror and -- using a hand-held

belt sander -- savagely shaves his horns. Sparks fly every

time he goes at the round stumps.

Myers murmurs --

Hellboy's face lights up.

OMIT

EXT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - DAY

Part of the building is demolished. Repair crews and firemen

are still hosing down smoldering piles of debris.

Myers arrives in a taxi cab.

INT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - MAX. SECURITY WING - DAY

Myers looks at LIZ through a see-through mirror. She sits on

a bench inside a padded cell. A security CAMERA AND MONITOR

records her constantly.

A worried-looking Dr. Marsh stands alongside him.

Myers nods, loosens his tie and enters.

INT. BELLAMIE MENTAL HOSPITAL - PADDED CELL - DAY

Liz doesn't acknowledge Myers' presence. He kneels and looks

up at her.

Liz turns away.

Silence.

She looks at him. He offers his hand. She looks away.

Liz turns to the 2-way mirror. Both their reflections are

there.

OMIT

INT. BEAM TUNNEL AREA - BENJAMIN INSTITUTE - DAY

An explosion of sound and light as a subway train passes

through a dank tunnel. Then, light beams sweep the encrusted

walls and steel columns.

Clay and some B.P.R.D. agents hold flashlights. Two of them --

MOSS and QUARRY -- carry FLAMETHROWERS.

Hellboy and Abe bring up the rear.

INT. STORAGE ROOM - DAY

They enter a store room piled high with filing cabinets,

typewriters and school desks. A turn-of-the-century mural

depicts happy boys doing charitable acts. A Latin phrase

("VIRILITER AGE") encourages them to behave like men.

Abe removes his gloves, hyperextends his palm and senses the

air. Then the surface of the water.

Debris and dust seem to float from the water's surface and

towards Abe's hand.

They point their flashlights at a bulkhead.

They move some filing cabinets and stare at a blank concrete

wall.

BAMMM!!! Hellboy's stone hand cracks the concrete. He starts

pounding, again and again, like a jack hammer.

INT. (SET/LOCATION BUILT SUGAR FACTORY) FURNACE ROOM - DAY

Makeshift living quarters tucked below a maze of furnace

ducts. Scores of old clocks fill the room with TICKING.

At a desk, Kroenen calmly repairs a mechanical hand: his

own.

His face is partly exposed. Under his leather mask, horrible

lidless eyes glitter over a skull-like grin, made of raw

gums and taut skin.

As Hellboy's pounding reaches his ears, he rises, like a

spider whose web has twitched. The mechanical hand rattles

blindly on the table.

He opens an ancient leather folder and extracts an engraving

depicting Sammael. Carefully places it on the table. Then he

opens a drawer and, from an envelope, takes two torn pieces

of paper. He puts them in a pouch in his belt.

INT. STORAGE ROOM - DAY

The wall collapses under Hellboy's attack.

Clay smiles uncertainly back. Hellboy moves in.

INT. ABANDONED SHOWER ROOM (SET) - DAY

A large oval room of rusting metal, with pipes spilling water

through a large GRATE on the floor.

Abe studies it, senses something, and nods. With superhuman

effort, Hellboy lifts it. Hundreds of roaches pour out.

Below, a vast cistern. Abe drops in two CHEMICAL FLARES.

INT. UNDERWATER - CHAMBER (SET TANK) - DAY

The flares sink, illuminating floating office furniture and

torn paper...

In the lower depths, they pass shadowy industrial ruins.

Settling on the bottom they reveal the hulk of a waiting

SAMMAEL.

INT. ABANDONED SHOWER ROOM (SET) - DAY

Abe pulls off his breathing apparatus. Activates the locator

on his utility belt. Hellboy does likewise. BEEEP! The devices

synchronize.

Hellboy extends a metal reliquary containing a small bone.

Abe ties the reliquary around his hand.

As transparent nictomembrane lids cover his eyes, Abe dives.

INT. UNDERWATER CHAMBER 2 - (LOCATION R.WAREHOUSE) - DAY

Underwater, ABE finds an entire control room. 1940's magazines

float by, like paper jellyfish. The amber light of the

chemical flares gives the room an eerie other-worldly feel.

INT. ABANDONED SHOWER ROOM (SET) - DAY

Waiting above, Hellboy chews a Baby Ruth and pokes around.

Finds a pile of children's shoes covering some yellowing

albums. In the albums, a myriad of sad faces, the orphans

from the past.

Some of the faces have been cut out. There's an unfinished

letter to Father Christmas, dated 1866.

Clay stands below a grate, admiring his hair implants with a

hand mirror.

Suddenly, something moves. Hellboy shines his light into an

adjoining tunnel. Kroenen is standing there, like a deer

caught in headlights.

The figure darts away. Hellboy tears after it, gun in hand.

Clay tries his radio. Static.

He pulls out his gun and runs after Hellboy.

INT. TUNNEL LABYRINTH (SET) - DAY

Clay arrives at an intersection of sewer tunnels. The glow

of Hellboy's flashlight is visible somewhere ahead, his

booming footsteps rapidly receding. A veritable labyrinth.

INT. UNDERWATER CHAMBER 2 (LOCATION R. WAREHOUSE) - DAY

Abe nears the bottom of the cistern. As his feet touch bottom,

a cloud of silt fogs the water. He picks out a translucent

egg!

Suddenly, something big glides by. Abe turns: sees nothing.

He places the egg in a glass canister. Now eggs are floating

everywhere, undulating in the water like amber fireflies.

Abe swims slowly, collecting them one by one.

Some of them are snugly wedged between two rusty machines.

Abe's reliquary gets caught in a lever and snaps loose!! It

lands --

on a grate on the floor. Abe swims down and tries to grab

it, but it falls through. Abe curses and stands up --

-- only to find himself FACE TO FACE with Sammael!!

The monster rakes Abe across the chest; dark blue blood begins

to flow. Abe shoves himself into a long, concrete fissure.

Sammael can't fit through, but the tongue darts out, missing

Abe by inches. Sammael scratches at the walls, trying to

reach deeper, screaming in rage.

Abe screams too, emitting a trail of bubbles.

INT. ABANDONED SHOWER ROOM - DAY

The bubbles burst on the surface. Watching them is a SECOND

SAMMAEL.

INT. INTERSECTION (LOCATION /BUILT SUGAR FACTORY) - DAY

Hellboy stops, disoriented. No trace of KROENEN. He sniffs

the air, then steps through a non-descript portal.

INT. (LOCATION/BUILT SUGAR FACTORY) FURNACE ROOM - DAY

Hellboy stands in Kroenen's quarters. An array of gas masks

dangle from ducts overhead. Glued next to the walls are dozens

of old photos of children.

He discovers the Sammael engraving.

Suddenly: drool drops from above: Sammael hangs from a beam.

Sammael lunges, hurling Hellboy through an open service

shaft...

...and it's a long way down.

When Sammael leaps, Hellboy throws him over the edge. Sammael,

however, grabs Hellboy's tail and pulls him over the side.

OMIT

INT. SERVICE SHAFT (NEW LOCATION SET) - DAY

They crash through pipes, wiring and ducts and slide off

down a duct and into --

another passage. There they bounce off of dripping water

pipes and jutting steel I beams, until they finally break

through a mesh/insulation ceiling and directly onto --

INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM STATION - DAY

A subway platform. Full of people.

The two fighting creatures land on the ticket booth -- in an

explosion of coins, glass and steel!!! Some bold New Yorker

in the crowd start picking up handfuls of change.

The dust clears, revealing a large crater in the platform

floor.

Sammael hits Hellboy. The Red Giant lands on a line of

turnstiles, uprooting them all.

Sammael flies through the air, unfolds its bone scythe.

Hellboy rolls away. Sammael misses: the tip imbeds itself in

the floor and then -- TCHAKKK!!! -- in a concrete column.

Sammael pulls, bringing down part of the ceiling. More SCREAMS

from the fleeing public.

A mezzanine above Hellboy collapses, bringing the ceiling,

steel cables and office furniture down onto the Red Giant.

Sammael takes a step towards the crowd and roars --

Then, BAMMMMMM!!! A desk flies up into the air. Hellboy's

stone hand emerges, triumphant.

He climbs out of the crater. Sammael growls.

Hellboy rips off one of the turnstile bars and hits Sammael

again and again.

Sammael blocks the last hit and throws the bar away. It embeds

itself in the tile wall.

Sammael punches Hellboy, a hard uppercut.

Hellboy flies up, crashing through the plate glass of a second

mezzanine above the platform. He skids on the tile floor,

scraping a jagged line with his stone hand.

He slides past a group of BYSTANDERS and into a row of backlit

subway ads. He lands in a shower of glass and debris on a

wooden bench, breaking it in two.

Sammael climbs up into the mezzanine.

Hellboy gets up -- his back bristling with glass shards --

and hears a WAIL: a YOUNG GIRL is pointing at A BOX OF KITTENS

abandoned on a bench.

Sammael charges!!! Hellboy scoops up the box, holds it high!!

Using his bone blade, Sammael pulverizes the bench.

Next, Sammael slashes at Hellboy, scattering a dozen shrieking

citizens.

Illuminated by sparks and shorting lamps, Hellboy advances,

blood dripping from his forehead and nose.

Hellboy starts to reload, but -- Sammael's tongue shoots

out. Hellboy throws the kitten box in the air and -- traps

the tongue with his stone hand --

-- while catching the box with his tail. The kittens are

fine.

Using the tongue, he throws Sammael out a glass window.

Sammael dangles above the tracks, but he re-joints himself

and grabs a handhold on the train wall above the tunnel.

From here, he pulls on Hellboy, sliding him toward the jagged

glass.

Sammael pulls harder, enters the tunnel.

Hellboy fights to free himself, but his sweaty face is

millimeters away from being sliced by the glass. All seems

lost, when...

WHAAAAA!!!!!! A train appears out of nowhere heading straight

for Sammael.

It splatters the thing against the tunnel wall and plows on.

Sammael's body sprawls motionless at the side of the tracks.

Hellboy approaches Sammael, whose remains are wreathed in

BLACK flame. A huge CROWD looks on from the end of the

platform.

He moves away. The BLACK flame flickers out.

INT. UNDERWATER CHAMBER 2 (LOCATION R.WAREHOUSE) - DAY

Under the water, BLACK light blooms within TWO OF SAMMAEL'S

EGGS as a fantastic methamorphosis starts. The embryos burst

out, gyrating in the water, swelling and distending.

INT. UNDERWATER CHAMBER 2 (LOCATION R.WAREHOUSE) - DAY

Badly wounded, Abe peers from his hiding spot. Sammael's not

there.

He quickly swims to the surface, his weird blue blood trailing

behind him. The water boils with energy and BLACK LIGHT.

INT. ABANDONED SHOWER ROOM (SET) - DAY

Abe staggers out of the pool and hides behind a crumbling

shower stall. Behind him, two SHAPES come to the surface.

Shaking, Abe pushes his belt locator and collapses.

INT. SUBWAY TRACKS (NEAR THE STATION) - DAY

Hellboy's locator belt crackles to life. BLUE.

INT. BEAM-SUPPORTED UNDERGROUND TUNNEL/ STORAGE ROOM - DAY

Back in the tunnel, Quarry and moss move filing cabinets and

rotten bozes full of files. One of them gives out and papers

spill all over.

Their locators light up.

Suddenly -- a noise! The agents leap up and sweep their

flashlights over the columns... Nothing there.

Then, TWO SILHOUETTES cast long shadows. Powerful footfalls

boom like thunderclaps.

Agent Quarry raises his gun and fires at the dark shapes.

Useless: the things plow on.

Moss hurriedly straps on his flame thrower. After a few

seconds, a green light beeps, READY.

The muzzle of the flamethrower vomits a 30 feet long gout of

fire into the blackness.

The men pause: silence!

Quarry turns on his flashlight, hand trembling.

BAM!!! SAMMAEL'S TONGUE uncurls from the shadows and lands

on Quarry's face, pulling him into the dark. His flashlight

bobbles and strobes, lighting up a nightmare:

TWO SAMMAELS stand in the tunnel. One of them gleefully

squeezes Quarry. The man's screams are muffled by the

creature's fleshy lips wrapping around his head.

Moss runs as fast as he can, jumping and tumbling through an

obstacle course of beams. Turning, he readies the

flamethrower. The SECOND SAMMAEL lands on Moss's back,

breaking his spine.

INT. ABANDONED SHOWER ROOM (SET) - DAY

Hellboy enters to find Abe, bleeding but alive, leaning

against the tile, blue blood all around him. Hellboy tries

his walkie-talkie. Turns on his locator. It sparks. It's

damaged and broken.

INT. CENTER OF THE TUNNEL LABYRINTH (SET) - DAY

Clay stumbles around, lost. He stops under a grate.

Behind Clay, Kroenen drops down from an overhead pipe, through

shafts of gray light. He brings forth his customary long

blade. Clay turns in time to see Kroenen coming at him. He

fires. Kroenen stabs.

Twin rivulets of blood run from Clay's nostrils.

INT. TUNNEL LABYRINTH - CONNECTING SHOWER ROOM (SET) - DAY

Hellboy hears the gunfire, starts running.

INT. CENTER OF THE TUNNEL LABYRINTH (SET)

Clay falls to the floor.

Kroenen stands there, unfazed by Clay's bullets in his chest.

Dust pours from his wounds and piles up neatly at his feet.

He hears Hellboy coming.He places the knife on the floor,

then lies down and plays dead.

Hellboy appears at the end of the tunnel. He glances at

Kroenen's body, then quickly checks for a pulse on Clay.

Hellboy looks demolished.

INT. TAXI CAB (MOVING) / EXT. BPRD ADJACENT AVENUE - DAY

An ethnic pop song blasts from the taxi radio. Liz pokes her

head out of the window and shoots a Polaroid snapshot. She

passes it to Myers:

He can't hear her over the music. Myers knocks on the

bulletproof acrylic divider.

He merely changes the radio station; the music stays at the

same volume. Myers looks back at Liz.

She is halfway out the window, sitting on the door.

She takes another Polaroid and passes it down to him. Myers

looks at the Polaroid, then smiles. He climbs out of the

other window, hands her the photograph.

He waves at her. For the first time, she smiles.

She takes his picture. With the cold morning wind blowing

Liz's hair and the sun on her face, she looks beautiful.

Myers taps his fingers on the roof, to the beat of the music.

He can't take his eyes off her. They drive towards the BPRD.

INT. B.P.R.D. MEDICAL BAY - DAY

Unconscious, Abe floats in a special tank. LED strips read

water temperature, pH level, etc. He's encased in a bio-cast:

a cybernetic healing unit wrapped around his thorax and right

arm. A web of tubes and hoses keeps him in place.

SHIRTLESS and bandaged, Hellboy sits and studies him, as if

in a trance.

Hellboy turns, Manning is there:

He turns to leave. Hellboy gets up.

BAMMMMM!!!! He smashes a metal LOCKER with his stone hand

and raises it above his head.

Manning cowers, realizing that Hellboy's rage is a dangerous

thing.

INT. B.P.R.D. - MAIN HALL AREA - DAY

A new space. Office corridors radiate out from a brass

B.P.R.D. logo on the floor. A few agents monitor computer

stations and tactical glass boards.

Liz and Myers walk in, carrying her suitcases. She looks

around and sees BROOM coming down the hall.

CRASH!!! Liz screams and Myers draws his gun. Smashing through

a glass partition, the mangled steel LOCKER lands in the

middle of the hall in a rain of glass and aluminum studs.

Next, Manning appears, retreating but unharmed.

He flees.

Mortified, Broom hurries after Manning. Hellboy calmly steps

through the hole in the wall.

She spins on her heel and walks off. Hellboy turns to Myers.

Myers holsters his gun and follows Liz. Hellboy is all alone

now.

INT. B.P.R.D. - LIZ'S ROOM - DAY

A familiar cell. Fireproof insulation covers the walls. Liz

throws her bags on the bed. Myers lingers in the doorway.

She reflexively pulls on one of the rubber bands on her wrist,

then lets it snap.

He sits by her side on the bed.

INT. HELLBOY'S DEN - DUSK

A cat bats at a ball of paper. On it, two words are visible:

DEAR LIZ. Hellboy's tail scoops up the paper and throws it

in a brimming wastebasket.

He's sitting at a stainless steel desk, deep in concentration,

writing with evident difficulty. The floor around him is

covered with more crumpled pages. In the background, the

projector is showing DUCK SOUP. Myers pushes in a cartload

of CHILI.

Myers sets the tray on the table.

As he goes out, Liz appears in the doorway. Hellboy quickly

stops writing.

Liz plays with a cat. Hellboy lifts the piece of paper, which

looks like a postage stamp in his stone hand.

Hellboy stands up, walks towards her.

Myers walks back in pushing a tray of nachos.

Hellboy folds the paper.

She leaves. Myers smiles.

INT. B.D.R.P. MEDICAL BAY - NIGHT

Under a sheet, Kroenen's cold, naked body lies on a slab.

Broom talks into a tape recorder.

The visible areas of the body make us grateful for the sheet

covering the rest.

The silver hand and harness lie on a table.

He finds the small pieces of paper Kroenen planted in his

pouch.

INT. B.P.R.D. HALLWAYS - NIGHT

Under the gaze of high-security cameras, AGENT LIME rolls

Hellboy's food cart down the corridor and into the domed

intersection. He whistles a happy tune. Opens the high

security door.

INT. HELLBOY'S DEN - NIGHT

Lime's jaw drops.

Across the room, one of the walls has been completely

demolished, revealing a SERVICE SHAFT.

No sign of Hellboy.

Lime peeks into the SERVICE SHAFT.

OMIT

EXT. NEWARK, N.J. - STREETS - NIGHT

Myers and Liz leave a coffee shop, strolling down the street.

Myers hands Liz her coffee. They chat and laugh. He pushes

his Moped. She has her Polaroid with her.

EXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP - NIGHT

EXT. NEWARK N.J. STREETS - NIGHT

Liz and Myers pause at a corner, waiting for the light. The

shops are closing.

Liz half-smiles, sips her coffee.

As they walk down the street. A red streak jumps over roof

tops.

EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

Hellboy lands neatly on the adjacent roof. He looks down at

Myers and Liz --

Myers offers her cream and sugar.

She takes the coffee, waves off the half and half.

Trying to feel superior, Hellboy chuckles. As they walk, Liz

gestures vigorously. His smile fades.

EXT. NEWARK N.J. STREETS - NIGHT

By now, all the shops are closed. They approach a small park

near a train track.

She cleans off a wet, dirty bench, sits down.

Myers is falling for her.

EXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP - FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT

Hellboy leaps off a building.

EXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP - NIGHT

Two red hands appear over the rooftop parapet. Cursing,

Hellboy hauls himself up. He finds himself next to a pigeon

coop where a YOUNG KID is feeding the birds.

The kid stares at him.

He watches as Liz and Myers sit on the bench.

INT. HELLBOY'S DEN - NIGHT

Broom examines the damage to the wall. He turns to see

Hellboy's locator belt hanging on the wall. Broom shakes his

head.

Broom motions for him to stop. It's useless,

INT. B.P.R.D. MEDICAL BAY - NIGHT

Kroenen's body lies on the table. Slowly, his chest starts

to rise and fall. He sits up.

His arm stump docks into the prosthetic hand -- Click! He

flexes the shiny fingers.

Kroenen's hideous cranium is visible for an instant before

he zips up his mask. He takes the sharp Ragnarok knives and

turns one over. It reflects a figure standing behind him:

Grigory.

EXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP - NIGHT

The pigeon kid walks towards Hellboy, carrying two glasses

of milk and a plate of cookies.

He sits by Hellboy's side as he watches Liz and Myers chatting

and laughing.

Hellboy grabs three cookies off the plate and scarfs them

down.

Below, Myers yawns. Hellboy slaps his forehead.

He looks around, picks up a pebble, hefts it.

EXT. NEWARK N.J. STREET - LIZ AND MYERS - NIGHT

Myers stretches and places his hand and arm behind her back.

Something hits him in the head.

He gets up, annoyed. No one in sight.

EXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP - NIGHT

Hellboy snickers, hiding and chewing a cookie. The Kid "gives

him five".

INT. BROOM S OFFICE - NIGHT

Kroenen's two pieces of paper are joined together under a

MICRO-SCANNER. Broom watches as computer enhancement fills

out a couple of missing areas.

Cyrillic letters are now legible.

Broom pulls out a few old photos. Finds one of Grigory in

German uniform, and in a book, another of Grigory in an

Orthodox priest's black cassock.

He pulls out his old wooden box, pulls out a dusty book from

it. His fingers scan the text, finding Rasputin's date of

birth, date of death. They pause at a particular line: "His

mausoleum is at SEBASTIAN PLACKBA #16".

TCHK!! A noise -- Broom turns in time to see Kroenen

delicately descending a spiral staircase, blade in hand. In

spite of all his experience, Broom is shaken.

In the dark, a voice hisses --

Broom turns. Grigory steps from the shadows.

He touches Broom's forehead, lightly --

FLASH!!

A nightmarish tableau...

EXT. RUINS OF N.Y. - DUSK

The ruins of New York, charred, smoldering. Human remains

litter the landscape. Monstrous shapes lumber in the

distance... an army of apocalyptic beasts outlined against

the blood-red sky.

Dominating the horror is a mountain of festering skeletons

and skulls. At the top, a figure: HELLBOY, transformed. His

horns are in full bloom, his eyes and mouth stream unearthly

fire.

INT. BROOM S OFFICE - NIGHT

Startled, Broom snaps out of it --

Broom is speechless.

Rasputin stands, the flesh of his neck and shoulders heaving

and twitching beneath his human skin.

Discreetly, Broom removes his rosary and places it on the

book. Kroenen settles in behind him.

Kroenen's knife goes in.

EXT. BUILDING ROOFTOP - NIGHT

The pigeons flutter on the rooftop.

The pigeon kid sits by Hellboy's side.

Hellboy turns and sees --

TWO of the black B.P.R.D. Sedan cars rounds the corner.

Agent Lime bounds out of one of the vehicles, grabbing Myers,

talking rapidly. Liz screams, covers her ears.

OMIT

INT. B.P.R.D. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Agents and Bureau employees are crammed into Broom's office

doorway. Hellboy, face contorted by grief, pushes through.

INT. BROOM'S OFFICE - NIGHT

The room is full of forensics people taking pictures, picking

up evidence, etc. Tom Manning is there. Seeing Hellboy, he

respectfully steps back.

Broom's fragile body lies slumped in his chair. At his feet,

a pool of blood. Liz enters, then stifles a whimper.

With tears in his eyes, a disbelieving Hellboy looks at Liz,

then at his dead father. He holds Broom's body close to his

chest.

Manning herds everybody out. From the door, Liz blinks back

tears as the red giant kneels by the body: a dog with a lost

master.

OMIT

EXT. BPRD BUILDING - DAY

It's raining like hell.

The PALLBEARERS, Manning and Myers among them, load Broom's

casket into a HEARSE. Flanking it are two rows of BPRD agents.

The hearse doors close and the vehicle pulls away.

Watching like a gargoyle from a distant roof: Hellboy. Rain

bounces off his wet overcoat.

Liz observes him, worried.

INT. MEDICAL BAY - DAY

Abe, conscious now, but still in the cast, floats upside

down, solving a RUBIK'S CUBE. Liz stands by the tank.

She smiles faintly.

Their hands almost touch, separated only by the glass.

OMITTED

INT. B.P.R.D. CONFERENCE ROOM - DUSK

A PROJECTION SCREEN shows the enhanced image of the piece of

paper with Cyrillic characters.

In a meeting room, Manning stands at a polished obsidian

desk. A group of agents -- Myers among them -- listens

attentively.

Myers spots Liz walking past the conference room.

INT. BROOM'S OFFICE - DUSK

Hellboy stands before Broom's desk, pensive, his naked chest

bandaged.

Liz watches him from across the room. He finds Broom's rosary

on top of the book. Reads the underlined phrase on the page.

He turns to her. She slowly comes towards him.

Hellboy nods, then clears his throat.

He looks her in the eye.

EXT. MOSCOW WAREHOUSE - DAY

Super: TOPOCKBA STEEL MILLS, MOSCOW A wasteland of rust and

decay. Rotting warehouses line the street like dead steel

watchdogs. No one's around but a few lonely sentries.

A limo and motorcycle caravan are waved through the security

gates.

INT. MOSCOW WAREHOUSE - DUSK

A metal door trundles back and the limo and escort motorcycles

enter.

Fleshy Russian General -- LAPIKOV -- gets out of the limo.

Then Ilsa and Grigory.

The warehouse contains a world of bric-a-brac: a towering

marble LENIN HEAD, Old Master paintings, tanks, warheads,

missiles, etc.

They stop before a cargo container. With a butane torch, a

soldier melts away the lead Kremlin seal, then open the doors.

INT. MOSCOW WAREHOUSE - THE CONTAINER - SAME

A massive stone monolith of polished MARBLE.

Grigory's fingers brush over its smooth, perfect surface. At

the center --

-- TWO CIRCULAR IMPRINTS that match Hellboy's four-fingered

stone hand.

Ilsa brings out a chrome box, full of gold.

Grigory's voice drips with serene brutality.

EXT. THE NIGHT SKY (MATTE SHOT) - NIGHT

A massive CARGO PLANE slices the white eye of a full moon. A

map details the plane's journey over the Black Sea.

Super: RUSSIAN AIRSPACE - BLACK SEA.

INT. CARGO PLANE - NIGHT

As the plane engines DRONE, Myers supervises BPRD agents

Lime and Stone, who stencil a large crate: FRAGILE! LIVE

CARGO.

Hellboy and Liz stand around a brightly-lit work table.

Hellboy shows them the medieval illustration of Sammael.

MANNING shows them a set of GRENADE BELTS.

Manning looks at Hellboy, irate.

Hellboy wraps Broom's rosary on his wrist.

OMIT

EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

Two gleaming black vans and a truck move through snow-covered

Soviet roads.

Super:  VOLOKOLAMSK FIELDS, MOSCOW.

EXT./INT. COUNTRYSIDE - IN THE TRUCK CAB - DAY

Myers and LIZ struggle with a Moscow map.

Popping her head out of the window, Liz looks back at the

truck bed.

EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - THE TRUCK BED - DAY

Fastened to it, the crate labelled: LIVE CARGO. Small

breathing holes have been drilled in the sides.

EXT./INT. COUNTRYSIDE - THE TRUCK CAB- DAY

Liz snickers.

INT. INSIDE THE CARGO BOX - DAY

Hellboy, sitting on the floor, in the dark.

They hit a series of bumps. The box rattles and shakes.

Hellboy bangs his head. The vehicle lurches to a halt.

Motors are turned off. The crate is opened. Liz peeks in.

EXT. 19TH CENTURY CEMETERY - DAY

Hellboy steps out. Takes a moment to adjust his eyes to the

light.

19TH CENTURY CEMETERY (MATTE SHOT / COMPOSITE)

Broken spiked fences succumb to rust and dead vines. Endless

rows of crypts and tombstones poke through wild foliage.

Our group plus TWO AGENTS (Lime and Stone) venture into the

labyrinthine lanes of the dead. Each carries a backpack, a

flashlight and a gun.

EXT. CEMETERY - MAUSOLEUM SECTION (LOCATION) - DAY

Later. The group gathers in frustration in an area of baroque

funerary monuments. Myers -- carrying the explosive belts --

looks around.

He gestures and all the agents head for the vans.

EXT. OPEN GRAVE - DAY

The group surrounds a grave. Hellboy raises the broken stone

cover and then jumps in.

EXT. OPEN GRAVE (SET) - DAY

-- and lands on a rotten coffin. In it, a mummified corpse

lies in a miserable black suit.

He presses the amulet on the cadaver's forehead. For a moment,

nothing, and then...

...a brutal spasm!! The corpse gasps, breathes... and mutters

something in tongueless Russian. SUBTITLE: WHAT DO YOU WANT?

EXT. MOSCOW CEMETERY (LOCATION) - DAY

The group gawks as Hellboy climbs out, carrying the CORPSE

on his back. With an ear-to-ear grin, he approaches the team.

The corpse fidgets on Hellboy's back. Its bony hand weakly

points, as if in confirmation.

The corpse mutters again. SUBTITLED: GO THAT WAY, RED MONKEY.

EXT. CEMETERY - YEFIMOVICH MAUSOLEUM (LOCATION) - DAY

A miniature black marble castle. Using a crowbar, Myers pries

open the ancient steel door. Hellboy, still carrying the

desiccated abomination on his back, walks in.

OMIT

INT. YEFIMOVICH MAUSOLEUM STAIRS - LATER - DAY

Two agents stand guard in the mausoleum, while the group

descends carefully. The walls are dotted with yellowed skulls.

INT. YEFIMOVICH MAUSOLEUM - UNDERGROUND - STAIRCASE

Myers' flashlight flickers. He shakes it back to life.

INT. UNDERGROUND - UNDERGROUND INTERSECTION

They reach the bottom of the staircase: three corridors branch

off in different directions. Hellboy deposits the CORPSE

attop a pile of coffins.

INT. UNDERGROUND CORRIDOR AND INTERSECTION - DAY

TCHKANGGG!!!!! large spiked metal plates shoot up from below,

blocking both their way out, demolishing the staircase and

ramming Stone: he's gone.

Wicked spikes cover the metal surface. Hellboy still bangs

on it, but to no avail: it's at least six inches thick. Liz

and Myers are on the other side.

On the other side of the panel, Myers takes the radio from

Liz.

Liz and Myers move off. Hellboy shines his light down the

tunnel on the left. Agent Lime picks up the corpse and

follows.

INT. TUNNEL "A" / CHAMBER - DAY

Hellboy and Manning come into a vast chamber: Slavic motifs

crown the rugged stone pillars and archways. Water runs down

the walls.

Across a small stone bridge, light pours from a hexagonal

structure.

They step onto the bridge. KLANGGG!!! two gears release a

steel door from above, forcing them to forge ahead.

Somewhere, a  massive clockwork is TICKING.

Hellboy motions for silence. The CORPSE mutters: "IT'S

SOMETHING BIG"

They stare into the darkness.

Hellboy yanks Manning just in time. BAMMM!!!! A gigantic

metal pendulum swings past and demolishes one third of the

bridge a few feet from their feet. It takes Lime and the

CORPSE with it.

Another door on the far end of the bridge shudders downward.

Whoosh! The PENDULUM swings back. It destroys more of the

bridge. Manning sprints for all he's worth and crawls under

the door.

Hellboy runs, but chunks of stone disintegrate under his

feet.

The pendulum swings back taking out the final piece of the

bridge just as Hellboy rolls under the door --

-- and makes it into the hexagonal building.

INT. STONE CORRIDOR - DAY

Hellboy and Manning find themselves in a very narrow, arched

stone corridor. Its walls are lined with endless rows of

rusty steel blades.

Faint traces of WAGNER can be heard. They cautiously

proceed...

INT. HEXAGONAL STONE LAB - DAY

There. In yellow gaslight, Kroenen nods attentively as a

phonograph plays the love duet from TRISTAN UND ISOLDE.

Above him, ropes, hooks and pulleys.

INT. STONE CORRIDOR - DAY

Manning rest his hand too close to a blade.

INT. HEXAGONAL STONE LAB - DAY

Kroenen comes alert. He scans the room, quietly winds himself

up.

INT. STONE CORRIDOR - DAY

Hellboy shoots a dirty look at Manning and then looks back

into the chamber --

-- Kroenen is gone.

Hellboy readies his gun and then creeps toward the lab.

INT.  HEXAGONAL STONE LAB - DAY

Hellboy's footsteps elicit soft creaks from the wooden floor.

Manning moves along behind him.

The record finishes playing. Silence --

SWISH!!! Kroenen's whirling blades slice the air, ripping

into Manning's arm. As Kroenen goes in for the kill --

-- Hellboy thrusts out his stone fist as a shield. Kroenen

bears down but Hellboy fends him off with powerful, deliberate

blocks.

Kroenen hauls out one of his long swords.

Hellboy yanks it away and bends it like a twig. BAMMMM!!!!

He punches Kroenen in the face, crumpling the steel mask,

smashing its lenses.

BAMMM!!!! another hit.

Kroenen staggers back with each blow. Finally, the mask falls

off.

An asthmatic wheeze erupts from his scarred face. Kroenen is

laughing.

INT. HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY

BAM!!! Under his feet, a huge trapdoor falls open. He and

Manning drop through, along with the phonograph.

Hellboy grabs a rope. It spins through a copper pulley, but

a large knot jerks him to a stop. Hellboy snatches Manning's

hand, but loses his backpack.

He looks down. The phonograph hits the ground with a crash.

KLANGGGG!!!!! The entire bottom bristles with six-foot,

sparkling steel blades.

INT. ABOVE THE HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY

Kroenen cautiously leans over the pit. He can't hear a sound.

As he peeks -- SWISH!! A loop of the rope wraps around his

neck and yanks him forward! Before he goes over, he

frantically digs his blades into the floor, anchoring himself.

INT. HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY

Hellboy has used the rope hanging below him as a lasso.

MANNING clings to his powerful back as he climbs up, hand

over hand.

INT. ABOVE THE HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY

Kroenen goes to cut the rope...

INT. HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY

Hellboy wraps the rope around his stone fist and, with a

brutal stone-fist yank, pulls KROENEN into the pit!

With a horrible scream, Kroenen drops headfirst past them

and onto the spikes. He wriggles like a fish caught on a

hook, only making it worse, as he slides further down the

blades.

INT. ABOVE THE HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY

Hellboy climbs out and sits. Sees Kroenen's blade embedded

in the floor. Holding it: the prosthetic hand, still ticking.

INT. ABOVE THE HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY

Hellboy peers down. Still alive, Kroenen frees one arm,

slicing through his own ropy bicep.

INT. BOTTOM OF HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY

Hellboy tips a massive cogwheel over the edge. Kroenen emits

a horrid scream as it crushes him.

INT. ABOVE THE HEXAGONAL TRAP DOOR PIT - DAY

Manning sits down, bandaging his injuries. Hellboy kneels

down.

Manning nods weakly. Hellboy brings out a cigar and fires up

his Zippo.

He digs out one of his fine cigars, cuts it and hands it to

HELLBOY.

He lights it for him. Hellboy grins.

OMIT

INT. TUNNEL "B" - UNDERGROUND NARROW TUNNEL - DAY

A narrow tunnel. Liz and Myers advance carefully.

Just ahead, a cave-in. Pieces of ceiling, timber, coffins

and corpses form a chaotic barrier. As they squeeze past...

A few bones roll by. Wet earth drops onto their shoulders.

They draw their arms close to their bodies, pointing their

flashlight beams straight down. A moment of strange intimacy.

INT. TUNNEL "C" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - STEEP SLOPE - DAY

Hellboy labors up a steep slope, using rocks and roots for

handholds. He reaches a dead end and collapses, out of breath.

Light filters through a crack in the ground; he can faintly

hear Liz and Myers.

INT. TUNNEL "B" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - CAVERN AREA - DAY

Liz and Myers reach a wider section of Tunnel "B". They find

themselves calf-deep in brown water.

Myers lights Liz's path as she steps onto a large stone.

His light shorts out. She shines her light past him.

Myers turns. His flashlight comes back on, revealing a complex

natural cavern. An entire WALL IS COVERED with translucent

eggs.

SAMMAEL is there, gnawing on a dry arm bone, with the hand

still attached. When the light hits his face, his milky pupils

constrict. A snarl...

A SECOND SAMMAEL emerges from the water. It shakes itself

off. A THIRD ONE raise its head.

Myers and Liz try to back away, but a metal wall rises right

behind them KLANKKKKK!!! They are trapped!!

Myers goes to grab a set of explosive belts. Tries to set up

the timer. Zipp! -- one Sammael snatches them away. Myers

falls to the ground, clothes torn, injured.

Something stomps on the ceiling directly above them. Again

and again.

INT. TUNNEL "C" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL FLOOR - DAY

Hellboy pounds the floor with his rock hand. Furiously.

The rocks below him start to crumble.

EXT. ANTHILL VIEW OF UNDERGROUND TUNNELS AND PITS - DAY

In an "ANT FARM" view of the complex, we see Hellboy above,

pummeling and -- in the cavern below -- Liz and Myers.

INT. TUNNEL "B" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL CAVERN AREA - DAY

Dust and rocks fall from above. The four identical creatures

move in on Liz and Myers. Myers shoots one in the head three

times. The creature shakes off the hits as if pelted with

pebbles.

One of them springs. As it flies through the air, Hellboy

crashes through the ceiling. He lands on top of it along

with a ton or two of stone. The creature is crushed.

Two eggs glow, metamorphosing. Presto -- two new Sammaels

are born. The first two Sammaels growl, joined by the two

new ones. Liz sprints to safety.

Hellboy scoops up Myers and deposits him next to Liz.

Lit by Myers' flashlight, two of the creatures jump. One

clamps onto Hellboy's back, the other onto his leg. Hellboy

howls. The third one joins in, like lions dragging down a

zebra. This time, though, the zebra fights back.

Hellboy pulls out his gun and fires a round into the chest

of a Sammael. Two eggs glow -- two new Sammaels are born.

They're FIVE.

Hellboy's torso is covered in blood. He falls to the ground.

A fourth and a fifth creature spring onto him, biting. Hellboy

is in trouble.

Liz watches and shivers. A ripple of heat shimmers over her

body.

Liz is desperate, crying.

Hellboy screams. Water explodes under the fighting bodies.

Two of the Sammaels turn their attention to Liz and Myers.

Liz slaps him.

A beat of silence, then Myers slaps her across the face,

once. Hard. The heat ripple builds. The air vibrates around

her. Her pupils kick back light, like an animal's.

Myers ducks behind a rock as Liz's arms blaze with fire.

The two approaching Sammaels are ready to pounce.

On top of Hellboy, one of them turns its head, like a lion

hearing the hunter's gunshots. A staggering Hellboy sees

Liz's body shake in a surge of white-hot energy.

The water at her feet blows away as a concave shockwave of

fire expands.

The fire engulfs the creatures. Devours them all.

INT. TUNNEL "B" - UNDERGROUND TUNNEL CAVERN AREA -  DAY

The screen FADES TO WHITE and then...

Silence, then a pulse. A high ringing tone. A heartbeat.

Hellboy pushes away the half-cooked remains of two Sammaels.

The other creatures are little more than blackened bones. He

stumbles forward. No water left. Everything is half-buried

in a cracked, bone-dry bed of mud. Liz lies on the ground,

on her side, unconscious.

Myers is alive, but too groggy to even acknowledge it. Weakly,

Hellboy turns around: In the eerie silence of his deafness,

he sees Grigory -- LAUGHING noiselessly, witness to an absurd

comedy.

Ilsa approaches. And -- in a simple, brutal move -- hits him

with a hammer --

FADE OUT / FADE IN

OMIT

INT. THE CATACOMBS - NIGHT

Hellboy slowly comes to. He is chained to a massive wooden

yoke. He takes notice of his surroundings: a large church-

like space, surrounded by funeral niches and statues holding

swords. High columns flank huge mechanical gears. An SOLAR

SYSTEM MODEL takes the place of an altar.

Off to one side, Ilsa uses a hammer to destroy the timers on

the explosive belts.

Next to the main nave, Myers is tied to a stone pillar. Under

his feet, a blood channel, leading to the immense stone slab

bought from Lapikov.

Liz lies at Grigory's feet. He's dressed in a ceremonial

robe and holds his leather book open. His back to Hellboy,

he faces a mural of the angel Abbadon holding a key.

Hellboy tenses, rage building. The yoke creaks, but doesn't

bend.

Hellboy studies the stone sculpture, its three HAND IMPRINTS --

Hellboy stares at his huge right arm, as if for the first

time.

Ilsa kicks Myers in the face.

The open dome above reveals the moon. An eclipse is beginning.

The altar's clockworks monitors its progress.

Grigory turns to Hellboy.

In torment, Hellboy, shakes his head: no.

He leans over Liz, whispers in her ear: Her body arches, her

mouth emits a plume of energy. Grigory greedily inhales it.

Then she goes limp.

He struggles again. One of the cuffs snaps. He swats Ilsa

with his free hand. She stumbles backwards. Now Hellboy fights

to free his other hand. Indifferent, Grigory watches the

eclipse.

His head and heart racing, Hellboy struggles for an answer.

Can't find one... the moon is almost totally eclipsed.

He drops his gaze. His voice a hoarse whisper.

Grigory moves close to Hellboy. Rips the rosary off his wrist.

It lands near Myers.

INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT

Hellboy's stone arm glows. Ancient symbols of fire burn the

stone. Flames momentarily engulf his body.

INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT

Hellboy roars as his HORNS majestically burst forth! Out of

his mouth, energy and light boil like condensing breath on a

winter's night.

Inebriated with power, the new PRINCE OF HELL smiles with

supreme arrogance. His shadow falls on the white marble of

the slab and mysteriously spreads over it until the stone

turns black as obsidian.

HELLBOY inserts his enormous paw into the FIRST IMPRINT on

the stone slab -- CLACK!! He turns it, like a lock.

A beam of crimson light shoot upwards into the sky.

EXT. VIEW FROM THE CITY - NIGHT

Visible from all over Moscow, the beam blazes to the moon!

The same phenomenon as in the prologue, but this time it's

more intense, with ripples and haloes.

INT. THE OTHER SIDE - NIGHT

Again, the infinite, starry space. Again, the OGDRU JAHAD.

The ruby beam pierces the darkness.

INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT

Hellboy watches as the FIRST IMPRINT disappears. In its place:

a burning glyph.

Myers struggles with his bindings. The rough hemp cuts his

skin, but he manages to free one hand.

EXT. ON THE OTHER SIDE - NIGHT

OGDRU JAHAD shifts, suddenly breaking free. Gelatinous limbs

uncurl, expand. Its enormity puzzles the eye, obscuring the

frame.

INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT

Hellboy thrusts his hand into the SECOND IMPRINT. CLACK! He

turns it.

Myers spots the broken rosary and reaches for it --

INT. THE SKY - NIGHT

IN THE STORM CLOUDS, LIGHTNING ILLUMINATES GARGANTUAN

TENTACLES REACHING INTO THE EARTHLY PLANE.

INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT

Grigory drinks in the first signs of the arrival and laughs.

Hellboy puts his hand inside, CLACK!!! Before he can turn

it, Myers reaches the rosary. Ilsa lunges at him. He clobbers

her full in the face. She staggers back and down.

He throws the rosary at Hellboy. Instinctively, Hellboy

catches it. It smokes in his hand.

He tosses it away. It lands next to the explosive belts.

Hellboy opens his palm, seeing the smoking, charred imprint

of the cross and beads. He looks over at Grigory.

With a blood-curdling scream, Hellboy grabs his horns with

both hands, brutally snaps them off. Energy spews from the

stumps.

He stabs Grigory with one of them. Grigory drops to his knees,

holding his stomach. Hellboy drops the blood-stained horn.

The final lock disappears into the stone. The light flickers

and the connection with the moon is broken.

Ilsa, licking her bloody lips, looks up. The sky is silent.

The thunderclouds are parting. The eclipse has ended.

Grigory crumples in agony.

The burning glyphs in Hellboy's stone hand dim down, his

features and body resume their usual shape. All is quiet.

He breaks Myers' chains, helps him up.

INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT

Hellboy painfully takes Liz's limp body in his arms. Myers

stands by his side.

He kisses her forehead, caresses her hair, then walks down

the steps.

Myers steps on something. He looks under his foot: A smashed

GLASS EYE. Then... out of the silence, a WHISPER.

Hellboy turns. Grigory, on his knees, smiles.

He looks up. In his empty eye socket, fleshy tendrils shift

lazily.

He uncovers his abdomen. Long, fleshy pseudopods spill out

of the wound, like intestines.

A large entity erupts from Grigory's torso and claws the

air.

Covered in steamy slime, a seven foot, multi-tentacled shape --

BABY BEHEMOTH -- lands on the stone slab. The squirming flesh

surges up like greasy pink foam. Growing exponentially by

the second.

Ilsa kneels and embraces Grigory's corpse. Kisses him on the

mouth. A gargantuan tentacled shadow looms above them.

A tower of flesh disdainfully crushes them both.

INT. CATACOMBS - ADJACENT TUNNEL - NIGHT

In a passageway, Hellboy carefully hands Liz's body over to

Myers.

As if in response, a massive tentacle fills the tunnel,

reaching for him. Oil lamps hanging from the ceiling smash

onto HELLBOY S head as he is pulled back at breakneck speed,

finally confronting --

INT. THE CATACOMBS - NIGHT

BEHEMOTH!!! The size of a house --

Hellboy -- head smoking -- writhes in the grip of the

tentacle. It suddenly throws him toward the ceiling.

As he arcs back down, ABM!! -- he cracks the floor wide open.

Next to him: the rosary and the EXPLOSIVE BELTS. He tries to

grab them. The tentacle slams down, blocking his way.

The vibration sends the belts down into the crack. They bounce

off a small ledge and land further down. Far below, grinding

cogwheels and gears.

Hellboy manages to pull a steel sword from the closest marble

statue.

Hellboy stands up and swings the sword for all he's worth.

FWAP! He cuts clean through the tentacle. The tip hits the

floor, rolling into the crack.

From out of Behemoth's stump... a mass of wriggling tentacles

replaces the cut-off section! They squirm around Hellboy's

face as he slashes, again and again, fighting his way forward.

He leans into the crack, stretches his arm, struggling to

grab the belts. A few inches short. He jumps into the crevice,

onto the first ledge. It crumbles!!

The gears below grind a few falling bricks. The belts slide

away.

A tentacle captures Hellboy, pulls him up. At the last second,

he grabs the belts with his tail.

The beast raises Hellboy high. A multi-layered mouth opens

in the body of BEHEMOTH. The most horrible proboscis ever

seen.

Hellboy's tail passes him the belts.

The timers on them are crushed. A spark spurts: Useless.

He wraps them around his stone arm.

He pulls the pin on all the explosives. BEHEMOTH drops him

into a squid-like beak and gulps him down.

After a moment, a weird gurgle emanates from the creature's

innards. Then --

INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT

A surge of light roils within the thing, outlining the pulpy

organs. The creature starts to burn.

OMIT

INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT

A chain reaction yields a cacophony of explosions as Behemoth

is enveloped in a cloud of fire, goo and soft flesh.

Hellboy lands with a sickening, bone-crunching THUD!!!

With a bellow, Behemoth goes down, the limp tentacles missing

Hellboy as they vanish in a blaze of energy and light.

Finally, just a few cinders of flesh float in the air.

INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT

Hellboy stands, covered in goo. Two final shockwaves of light

ripple over the ground.

INT. ADJACENT TUNNEL

Hellboy lurches into the passageway and spots Myers. Painfully

drags himself over. Liz's body is on the floor.

Manning limps in from an adjacent room. Hellboy cradles Liz's

head in his huge hand. Holds her against his powerful chest

and whispers in her ear.

A beat or two, then a moan.

He looks at her, lovingly caressing her hair.

Myers smiles. Liz looks at Hellboy for the first time as

what he is: the man she loves. A warm, gentle fire rims her

body.

Manning watches. Agent Myers smiles a sad smile, illuminated

by the flames.

Hellboy and Liz kiss. The fire haloes them and builds as Tom

Waits' CINNY'S WALTZ fills the air.
