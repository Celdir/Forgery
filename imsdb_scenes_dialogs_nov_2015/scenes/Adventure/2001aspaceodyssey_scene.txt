TITLE					    PART I

A1

VIEWS OF AFRICAN DRYLANDS - DROUGHT

The remorseless drought had lasted now for ten million years,

and would not end for another million. The reign of the ter-

rible lizards had long since passed, but here on the continent

which would one day be known as Africa, the battle for survival

had reached a new climax of ferocity, and the victor was not

yet in sight. In this dry and barren land, only the small or

the swift or the fierce could flourish, or even hope to exist.

A2

INT & EXT CAVES - MOONWATCHER

The man-apes of the field had none of these attributes, and

they were on the long, pathetic road to racial extinction.

About twenty of them occupied a group of caves overlooking

a small, parched valley, divided by a sluggish, brown stream.

The tribe had always been hungry, and now it was starving.

As the first dim glow of dawn creeps into the cave, Moonwatcher

discovers that his father has died during the night. He did not know

the Old One was his father, for such a relationship was beyond

his understanding. but as he stands looking down at the emac-

iated body he feels something, something akin to sadness. Then

he carries his dead father out of the cave, and leaves him for the

hyenas.

Among his kind, Moonwatcher is almost a giant. He is nearly

five feet high, and though badly undernourished, weighs over

a hundred pounds. His hairy, muscular body is quite man-like,

and his head is already nearer man than ape. The forehead is

low, and there are great ridges over the eye-sockets, yet he

unmistakably holds in his genes the promise of humanity. As

he looks out now upon the hostile world, there is already

A2

CONTINUED

something in his gaze beyond the grasp of any ape. In those

dark, deep-set eyes is a dawning awareness-the first intima-

tions of an intelligence which would not fulfill itself for another

two million years.

A3

EXT  THE STREAM - THE OTHERS

As the dawn sky brightens, Moonwatcher and his tribe reach

the shallow stream.

The Others are already there. They were there on the other

side every day - that did not make it any less annoying.

There are eighteen of them, and it is impossible to distinguish

them from the members of Moonwatcher's own tribe. As

they see him coming, the Others begin to angrily dance and

shriek on their side of the stream, and his own people reply

In kind.

The confrontation lasts a few minutes - then the display dies

out as quickly as it has begun, and everyone drinks his fill of

the muddy water. Honor has been satisfied - each group has

staked its claim to its own territory.

A4

EXT  AFRICAN PLAIN - HERBIVORES

Moonwatcher and his companions search for berries, fruit

and leaves, and fight off pangs of hunger, while all around

them, competing with them for the samr fodder, is a potential

source of more food than they could ever hope to eat. Yet

all the thousands of tons of meat roaming over the parched

savanna and through the brush is not only beyond their reach;

the idea of eating it is beyond their imagination. They are

slowly starving to death in the midst of plenty.

A5

EXT  PARCHED COUNTRYSIDE - THE LION

The tribe slowly wanders across the bare, flat country-

side foraging for roots and occasional berries.

Eight of them are irregularly strung out on the open plain,

about fifty feet apart.

The ground is flat for miles around.

Suddenly, Moonwatcher becomes aware of a lion, stalking

them about 300 yards away.

Defenceless and with nowhere to hide, they scatter in all

directions, but the lion brings one to the ground.

A6

EXT  DEAD TREE - FINDS HONEY

It had not been a good day, though as Moonwatcher had no

real remembrance of the past he could not compare one day

with another. But on the way back to the caves he finds a

hive of bees in the stump of a dead tree, and so enjoys the

finest delicacy his people could ever know. Of course, he

also collects a good many stings, but he scacely notices

them. He is now as near to contentment as he is ever

likely to be; for thought he is still hungry, he is not actually

weak with hunger. That was the most that any hominid could

hope for.

A7

INT & EXT  CAVES - NIGHT TERRORS

Over the valley, a full moon rises, and a cold wind blows down

from the distant mountains. It would be very cold tonight -

but cold, like hunger, was not a matter for any real concern;

it was merely part of the background of life.

This Little Sun, that only shone at night and gave no warmth,

was dangerous; there would be enemies abroad. Moonwatcher

crawls out of the cave, clambers on to a large boulder besides

the entrance, and squats there where he can survey the valley.

If any hunting beast approached, he would have time to get back

to the relative safety of the cave.

Of all the creatures who had ever lived on Earth, Moonwatcher's

race was the first to raise their eyes with interest to the Moon,

and though he could not remember it, when he was young,

Moonwatcher would reach out and try to touch its ghostly face.

Now he new he would have to find a tree that was high

enough.

He stirs when shrieks and screams echo up the slope from

one of the lower caves, and he does not need to hear the

A7

CONTINUED

occasional growl of the lion to know what is happening. Down

there in the darkness, old One-Eye and his family are dying,

and the thought that he might help in some way never crosses

Moonwatcher's mind. The harsh logic of survival rules out

such fancies. Every cave is silent, lest it attract disaster.

And in the caves, in tortured spells of fitful dozing and

fearful waiting, were gathered the nightmares of generations

yet to come.

A8

EXT  THE STREAM - INVASION

The Others are growing desperate; the forage on their side of

the valley is almost exhausted. Perhaps they realise that

Moonwatcher's tribe has lost three of its numbers during the

night, for they choose this mourning to break the truce. When

they meet at the river in the still, misty dawn, there is a

deeper and more menacing note in their challenge. The noisy

but usually harmless confrontation lasts only a few seconds

before the invasion begins.

In an uncertainly-moving horde, the Others cross the river,

shieking threats and hunched for the attack. They are led

by a big-toothed hominid of Moonwatcher's own size and age.

Startled and frightened, the tribe retreats before the first

advance, throwing nothing more substantial than imprecations

at the invaders. Moonwatcher moves with them, his mind a

mist of rage and confusion. To be driven from their own

territory is a great badness, but to lose the river is death.

He does not know what to do; it is a situation beyond his

experience.

Then he becomes dimly aware that the Others are slowing

A8

CONTINUED

down, and advancing with obvious reluctance. The further they

move from their own side, the more uncertain and unhappy

they become. Only Big-Tooth still retains any of his original

drive, and he is rapidly being seperated from his followers.

As he sees this, Moonwatcher's own morale immediately

revives. He slows down his retreat, and begins to make

reassuring noises to his companions. Novel sensations fill

his dim mind - the first faint precursors of bravery and

leadership.

Before he realizes it, he is face to face with Big-Tooth, and

the two tribes come to a halt many paces away.

The disorganized and unscientific conflict could have ended

quickly if either had used his fist as a club, but this

innovation still lay hundreds of thousands of years in the

future. Instead, the slowly weakening fighters claw and

scratch and try to bite each other.

Rolling over and over, they come to a patch of stony ground,

and when they reach it Moonwatcher is on top. By chance,

A8

CONTINUED

he chooses this moment to grab the hair on Big-Tooth's scalp,

and bang his head on the ground. The resulting CRACK is

so satisfactory, and produces such an immediate weakening

In Big - Tooth's resistance, that he quickly repeats it.

Even when Big-Tooth ceases to move for some time, Moon-

watcher keeps up the exhilirating game.

With shrieks of panic, the Others retreat back, across the

stream. The defenders cautiously pursue them as far as

The water's edge.

EXT  CAVE - NEW SOUND

Dozing fitfully and weakened by his stuggle, Moonwatcher is

startled by a sound.

He sits up in the fetid darkness of the cave, straining his

senses out into the night, and fear creeps slowly into his soul.

Never in his life - already twice as long as most members of

his species could expect - has he heard a sound like this. The

great cats approached in silence, and the only thing that

betrayed them was a rare slide of earth, or the occasional

cracking of a twig. Yet this is a continuing crunching noise

that grows steadily louder. It seemed that some enormous

beast was moving through the night, making no attempt at

concealment, and ignoring all obstacles.

And then there came a sound which Moonwatcher could not

possibly have identified, for it had never been heard before

in the history of this planet.

A10

EXT CAVE - NEW ROCK

Moonwatcher comes face to face with the New Rock when he

leads the tribe down to the river in the first light of morning.

He had almost forgotten the terror of the night, because nothing

had happened after that initial noise, so he does not even

associate this strange thing with danger or with fear. There

is nothing in the least alarming about it.

It is a cube about fifteen feet on a side, and it is made of

some completely transparent material; indeed, it is not easy

to see except when the light of the sun glints on its edges.

There are no natural objects to which Moonwatcher can

compare this apparition. Though he is wisely cautious

of most new things, he does not hesitate to walk up to it.

As nothing happens, he puts out his hand, and feels a warm,

hard surface.

After several minutes of intense thought, he arrives at a

brilliant explanation. It is a rock, of course, and it

must have grown during the night. There are many plants

that do this - white, pulpy things shaped like pebbles, that

seem to shoot up in the hours of darkness. It is true that

they are small and round, whereas this is large and square;

A10

CONTINUED

but greater and later philosophers than Moonwatcher would be

prepared to overlook equally striking exceptions to their laws.

This really superb piece of abstract thinking leads Moonwatcher

to a deduction which he immediately puts to the test. The white,

round pebble-plants are very tasty (though there were a few

that made one violently sick); perhaps this square one...?

A few licks and attempted nibbles quickly disillusion him.

There is no nourishment here; so like a sensible hominid, he

continues on his way to the river and forgets all about the Cube.

A11

EXT CUBE - FIRST LESSON

They are still a hundred yards from the New Rock when the

sound begins.

It is quite soft, and it stops them in their tracks, so that they

stand paralyzed on the trail with their jaws hanging. A simple,

maddeningly repetitious rhythm pulses out of the crystal cube

and hypnotises all who come within its spell. For the first

time - and the last, for two million year - the sound of

drumming is heard in Africa.

The throbbing grows louder, more insistent. Presently the

hominids begin to move forward like sleep-walkers, towards

the source of that magnetic sound. Sometimes they take little

dancing steps, as their blood responds to the rhythms that

their descendants will not create for ages yet.

Totally entranced, they gather around the Cube, forgetting

the hardships of the day, the perils of the approaching dusk,

and the hunger in their bellies.

Now, spinning wheels of light begin to merge, and the spokes

fuse into luminous bars that slowly recede into the distance,

A11

CONTINUED

rotating on their axes as they do; and the hominids watch, wide-

eyed, mesmerized captives of the Crystal Cube.

Then by some magic - though it was no more magical than all

that had gone on before - a perfectly normal scene appears. It

is as if a cubical block had been carved out of the day and

shifted into the night. Inside that block is a group of four

hominids, who might have been members of Moonwatcher's

own tribe, eating chunks of meat. The carcass of a wart-hog

lies near them.

This little family of male and female and two children is gorged

and replete, with sleek and glossy pelts - and this was a

condition of life that Moonwatcher had never imagined. From

time to time they stir lazily, as they loll at ease near the

entrance of their cave, apparently at peace with the world.

The spectacle of domestic bliss merges into a totally

different scene.

The family is no longer reposing peacefully outside its cave;

it is foraging, searching for food like any normal hominids.

A11

CONTINUED

A small wart-hog ambles past the group of browsing humanoids

without giving them more than a glance, for they had never been

the slightest danger to its species.

But that happy state of affairs is about to end. The big male

suddenly bends down, picks up a heavy stone lying at his feet -

and hurls it upon the unfortunate pig. The stone descends upon

its skull, making exactly the same noise that Moonwatcher had

produced in his now almost forgotten encounter with Big-Tooth.

And the result, too, is much the same - the warthog gives one

amazed, indignant squeal, and collapses in a motionless heap.

Then the whole sequence begins again, but this time it unfolds

itself with incredible slowness. Every detail of the movement

can be followed; the stone arches leisurely through the air, the

pig crumples up and sinks to the ground. There the scene

freezes for long moments, the slayer standing motionless

above the slain, the first of all weapons in his hand.

The scene suddenly fades out. The cube is no more than a

glimmering outline in the darkness; the hominids stir, as if

A11

CONTINUED

awakening from a dream, realise where they are, and scuttle

back to their caves.

They have no concious memory of what they had seen; but that

night, as he sits brooding at the entrance of his lair, his ears

attuned to the noises of the world around him, Moonwatcher

feels the first faint twinges of a new and potent emotion - the urge

to kill. He had taken his first step towards humanity.

A12

EXT cave AND PLAINS - Utopia

Babies were born and sometimes lived; feeble, toothless thirty-

year-olds died; the lion took its toll in the night; the Others

threatened daily across the river - and the trib prospered.

In the course of a single year, Moonwatcher and his companions

had changed almost beyond recognition.

They had become as plump as the family in the Cave, who no

longer haunted their dreams. They had learned their lessons

well; now they could handle all the stone tools and weapons that

the Cube had revealed to them.

They were no longer half-numbed with starvation, and they

had time both for leisure and for the first rudiments of thought.

Their new way of life was casually accepted, and they did

not associate it in any way with the crystal cube still standing

outside their cave.

But no Utopia is perfect, and this one had two blemishes. The

first was the marauding lion, whose passion for hominids

seemed to have grown even stronger now that they were better

nourished. The second was the tribe across the river; for

A12

CONTINUED

somehow the Others had survived, and had stubbornly refused to

die of starvation.

A13

EXT CAVES - KILLING THE LION

With the partly devoured carcass of a warthog laid out on the

ground at the point he hope the boulder would impact, Moon-

watcher and three of his bravest companions wait for two

consecutive nights. On the third the lion comes,

betraying his presences by a small pebble slide.

When they can here the lion below, softly tearing at the meat,

they strain themselves against the massive boulder. The sound

of the lion stops; he is listening. Again they silently heave

against the enormous stone, exerting the final limits of their

strength. The rock begin to tip to a new balance point.

The lion twitches alert to this sound, but having no fear of these

creatures, he makes the first of two mistakes which will cost

him his life; he goes back to his meal.

The rock moves slowly over the ledge, picking up speed with

amazing suddeness. It strikes a projection in the cliff about

fifteen feet above the ground, which deflects its path outward.

Just at this instant, the lion reacts instinctively and leaps

away from the face of the cliff directly into the path of the

A13

CONTINUED

onrushing boulder. He has combined the errors of over-

confidence and bad luck.

The next morning they find the lion in front of the cave. They

also find one of their tribe who had incautiously peeped out to

see what was happening, and was apparently killed by a small

rock torn loose by the boulder; but this was a small price to

pay for such a great victory.

And then one night the crystal cube was gone, and not even

Moonwatcher ever thought of it again. He was still wholly

unaware of all that it had done.

A14

EXT STREAM - MASTER OF THE WORLD

From their side of the stream, in the never violated safety of

their own territory, the Others see Moonwatcher and fourteen

males of his tribe appear from behind a small hillock over-

looking the stream, silhouetted against the dawn sky.

The Others begin to scream their daily challenge. But today

something is different, though the Others do not immediatly

recognize this fact.

Instead of joining the verbal onslaught, as they had always done,

Moonwatcher and his small band decended from the rise, and

begin to move forward to the stream with a quiet purposefulness

never befor seen.

As the Others watch the figures silently approaching in the

morning mist, they become aware of the terrible strangness

of this encounter, and their rage gradually subsides down to

an uneasy silence.

At the water's edge, Moonwatcher and his band stop. They

carry their bone clubs and bone knives.

A14

CONTINUED

Led by One-ear, the Others half-heartly resume the battle-

chant. But they are suddenly confrunted with a vision that cuts

the sound from their throats, and strikes terror into their

hearts.

Moonwatcher, who had been partly concealed by two males who

walked before him, thrusts his arm high into the air. In his

hand he holds a stoud tree branch. Mounted atop the branch is

the bloody head of the lion, its mouth jammed open with a stick,

displaying its frightful fangs.

The Others gape in fearful disbelief at this display of power.

Moonwatchers stands motionless, thrusting the lion's head high.

Then with majestic deliberation, still carrying his mangled

standard above his head, he begins to cross the stream, followed

by his band.

The Others fade back from the stream, seeming to lack even

the ability to flee.

Moonwatcher steps ashore and walks to One-Ear, who stands

A14

CONTINUED

unsurely in front of his band.

Though he is a veteran of numerous combats at the water's edge,

One-Ear has never been attacked by an enemy who had not first

displayed his fighting rage; and he had never before been attacked

with a weapon. One-Ear, merely looks up at the raised club

until the heavey thigh bone of an antelope brings the darkness

down around him.

The Others stare in wonder at Moonwatcher's power.

Moonwatcher surveys the scene. Now he was master of the

world, and he was not sure what to do next. But he would

think of something.
