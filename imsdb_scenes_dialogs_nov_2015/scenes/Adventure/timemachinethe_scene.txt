EXT. COTTAGE - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT) - (MATTE)

Warm lights pour through the windows, spreading

over the snow-patched countryside.  Only the

laboratory, a converted greenhouse, is dark, shaded

from the moonlight by a majestic, leafless oak.

A two-horse carriage, in the style of the turn of

the century, lingers in the driveway.  Beyond all

this, the River Thames takes a sharp curve.

A lonely figure hurries up to the front door and

KNOCKS on it impatiently.

AT THE DOOR                                            2

The knock is answered by MRS. WATCHETT, the house-

keeper, a thin, tense woman with iron gray hair.

The CAMERA ENTERS the HALL with DAVID FILBY, an

amiable red-haired young man of science, who hastily

hands her his rumpled cloak and hat, then rushes

toward:

INT. LIBRARY                                           3

A pleasant Edwardian room, the shelves are stacked

tightly with volumes of books, many of ancient

Vintage.

Three men are seated in a rough circle, motionless,

obviously awaiting the arrival of occupants for the

two empty chairs.  The silence is accentuated by the

merry CRACKLING of logs in the fireplace and the

capricious TICKING of innumerable timepieces about

the room.

Filby enters, pauses to glance down, then embarrassedly

takes his chair.

Reaching the hour of eight, it begins to STRIKE ITS

YELLOW CHIMES.  Other timepieces JOIN IN the announce-

ment.

GROUPSHOT                                              7

The men look at each other until the CHIMES, BELLS

ETC. FADE away.  Dr. Hillyer angrily slaps on the

arm of his leather chair.

Bridewell, filling his glass, is trying to say some-

thing but is interrupted by

All heads turn as Mrs. Watchett enters, closing the

door quietly behind her.  With an envelope in her

hand she stands there, hesitating.

She is taken aback for a moment, then walks over

to Filby and hands him the open envelope.  He

takes his time in extracting the note.

A faint, nervous smile is her acknowledgement and

with that she retreats toward the door.

Kemp tears the note out of Filby's hand and reads it

hurriedly.  Meanwhile, Mrs. Watchett swings the door

open and turns around.

He rises and starts for the dining room.  The others

follow.

FILBY, HILLYER & KEMP - MOVING SHOT                    8

As they walk toward the DINING ROOM.

Bridewell, already seated at the heavily laden dining

table, pours a glass of wine for himself while the

others settle down.  This time the chair at the head

of the table is conspicuously unoccupied.

The glass barely touches his lips as he freezes at

the SOUND OF DROPPING TRAYS and a PIERCING SCREAM.

All look in the direction of another door across

the room.

THE DOOR - FULL SHOT                                   9

It bursts inward and Mrs. Watchett, her hair flying,

dashes down the steps panic-stricken into the room.

The CAMERA RUSHES with her to the table where the

men have come to their feet.  Clutching Filby's arm,

she points toward the long corridor now revealed by

the open door.

All stare o.s., Hillyer with the carving knife

clasped in his hand.

CORRIDOR THROUGH DOORWAY - FULL SHOT                   10

We see the figure of a man approaching, a black

silhouette against the pale glow at the end of

the passage.  He is bent with exhaustion and

sways as he moves forward, limping.  The man comes

closer, his features still blacked out by shadows,

but as he nears the doorway, the light from the

room strikes first his legs, then his body and

finally his face.  Here he stops.

This is our first meeting with the TIME TRAVELLER

(for so it will be convenient to speak of him).  At

this instant he is in a sorry state.  His clothing

is tattered and dirty, his face pale, bruised and

scratched and his eyes glazed with fatigue.  For

a moment he hesitates as if dazzled by the light

and then takes another swaying step into the room.

FILBY AND BRIDEWELL - MOVING SHOT                      11

They come to life.  Bridewell, noticing the glass

of wine still in his hand, quickly gulps it down

before rushing with Filby toward the Time Traveller.

Reaching him, each seizes an elbow to support him.

Bridewell throws a frantic glance at Dr. Hillyer

back at the table.  The Time Traveller, however,

moves forward under his own power.

He reaches the table and sinks into his chair.  With

trembling hands Bridewell tries to pour him a glass

of wine, spilling most of it over the tablecloth.

The Time Traveller looks up at him with a wry smile.

A stunned Bridewell is unable to speak while the Time

Traveller empties his glass.

Meanwhile, Mrs. Watchett hovers over the Time Traveller

like a mother hen.

The CAMERA MOVES IN as she dishes up a bowl of soup

for him, but he pushes it away.

Mrs. Watchett grasps the carving knife from Dr.

Hillyer and, with a single slash, cuts off a huge

portion of beef and loads it onto his plate.

GROUPSHOT                                              12

The Time Traveller eats, the men watching him

curiously.  Finally Dr. Hillyer leans forward.

CLOSE ON THE TIME TRAVELLER                            13

As he looks up, amused.

Slowly the CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSER while everyone

listens so intensely that, aside from the Time

Traveller's VOICE, only the TICKING of a pendulum

CLOCK is heard.

INT. - EBONY BOX ON TABLE - CLOSE SHOT (AFTERNOON)     14

(NOTE:  The Slow Dissolve from the previous shot

The CAMERA DRAWS BACK to reveal the LIBRARY.  The Time

Traveller, wearing casual tweeds and smoking a pipe,

sits in his favorite chair behind the Ebony Box.

Across from him in another chair sits Dr. Hillyer

puffing his cigar.  Bridewell and Filby have glasses

in their hands -- Kemp nothing.  All are looking at

the box.

A perplexed look comes over Bridewell's face.

Dr. Hillyer registers concern.  Kemp looks troubled.

Only Filby expresses avid interest.

THE TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                         15

Leaning forward in his chair.

GROUP SHOT                                             16

In the f.g., Bridewell who has been sitting with a

glazed, dreamy look, suddenly jumps.

All eyes turn to Dr. Hillyer as he eagerly rushes to

the table, lifts the box with surprise at its lightness,

and takes it to the Time Traveller.  George opens it

with great care and brings forth a mechanical device

GROUPSHOT - LOW ANGLE                                  24

All eyebrows are raised.

They look at each other, uncertain whether he is

joking or not.  Bridewell stoops with difficulty to

examine the table.

Despite disbelief, there is a tense silence as he puts

his finger on the lever.  Then he pauses.

Dr. Hillyer extends his hand hesitantly, smiling

weakly.

INSERT OF MODEL                                        25

Using Dr. Hillyer's forefinger, the Time Traveller

presses the lever forward.  A LOW-PITCHED HUM is

heard.

CLOSE ON THE MEN - LOW ANGLE                           26

The men stare in fascination as the CAMERA PANS

and the HUMMING INCREASES.

INSERT OF MODEL                                        28

As the vibration increases, the outline of the model

is blurred and gradually becomes transparent, until

the Machine with the cigar has vanished utterly.

The HUMMING HAS REACHED A HIGH SHRIEK and STOPS

abruptly.

BACK TO CLOSE ON MEN - LOW ANGLE                       29

The sudden silence is almost unbearable.  They

stare at the empty table.  The CAMERA PANS.

Filby swallows.

Bridewell, with his mouth open, stares at the table.

Now he looks at the glass of champagne in his hand

and places it on the mantelpiece as far out of

reach as he can.  Then, suddenly reversing his

decision, he retrieves the glass and gulps it down.

TWO SHOT                                               31

Dr. Hillyer slowly turns to the Time Traveller.

Dr. Hillyer runs his hand over the top of the table.

Dr. Hillyer turns away, speechless.

GROUP SHOT                                             32

Kemp steps forward.

There is no response.

Dr. Hillyer, having controlled his fury, now exchanges

significant glances with Kemp and turns back with an

air of reasonableness.

CLOSE ON DR. HILLIER - MOVING SHOT                     33

He gets up from his chair.

He walks over to the Time Traveller who is sitting

near the table on which stands the empty Ebony Box

with its lid open.  Filby is in the b.g.

Lazily the Time Traveller toys with the lid of the

Ebony Box, then closes it with a SNAP.  He looks up

and nods.

BACK TO GROUP SHOT                                     34

Everyone rises.

Dr. Hillyer and Kemp head toward the door.  Bridewell

lingers at the table where the model of the Time

Machine disappeared.

Reluctantly Bridewell leaves the library followed

by the Time Traveller.

INT. ENTRANCE HALL - FULL SHOT                         35

While his guests put on their capes, overcoats, scarfs,

gloves and hats, preparing for the cold weather

outside, the Time Traveller steps to the door and

grasps the handle.

He opens the door and they file past him, Bridewell

at the rear.

Bridewell clasps the Time Traveller's shoulder,

reassuringly.

EXT. COTTAGE - LONG SHOT - (DUSK) - (MATTE)            36

In contrast to the previous SHOT (Sc.l) this is a snow-

less wintery day.  The visitors are boarding the

carriage that awaits them in the drive.

Bridewell glances back to the Time Traveller, then

submits and, with a CRACK OF A WHIP, the carriage

moves off.

EXT. ENTRANCE - FULL SHOT                              37

The Time Traveller, a silhouette framed in the door-

way, waves to them.

THE CARRIAGE                                           38

As it pulls away, Bridewell leans out, waving.  From

the opposite direction another carriage full of NOISY

YOUNG PEOPLE THUNDERS by.  In early New Year's Eve

REVELRY they TOOT their toy HORNS at the Time Traveller.

BACK TO THE TIME TRAVELLER                             39

Unmindful of their salutations he turns and enters the

cottage.

INT. ENTRANCE HALL - MED SHOT                          40

The Time Traveller slowly closes the door and leans his

back against it, staring into space.  Thinking. - He

spots a newspaper on a nearby table, apparently left by

one of his guests, and picks it up.

INSERT: NEWSPAPER                                      40-A

that the Boer Army has won another victory.

CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                40-B

He closes his eyes and, added to the DRUMS, we HEAR

the call to battle by a DISTANT BUGLE.  Then more

BRASS, FIFES and HORNS join the BUGLE and DRUMS to take

up a MILITANT OVERTURE.

He loosens his collar, then with sudden resolution

strides toward:

INT. LIBRARY - LONG SHOT                               57

The Time Traveller crosses to his writing table in

the f.g.  He stands there and even in the darkness

WE CAN OBSERVE that he is an angry man.  He strikes

a match and lights the overhead gas fixture.  The

light comes up and the MUSIC STOPS as he stares

across the room to see:

FILBY - MED. SHOT                                      58

sitting in a chair near the fireplace.

TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             59

Deep in thought, he goes to the fireplace and stirs

the coals.  The CAMERA FOLLOWS.

Distant SOUNDS of NEW YEAR'S CELEBRATIONS are HEARD.

He goes to the door.

AT THE DOOR                                            60

Filby stops, then turns around.

Filby, a little puzzled by this strange promise, turns

to go as the Time Traveller puts down the poker and

steps up to him.

Filby pats his arm before he leaves.  The Time Traveller

stands there until he hears the FRONT DOOR SHUT.  Then,

FOLLOWED BY THE CAMERA, he goes to the writing table

and sits down.

AT THE WRITING TABLE                                   61

The Time Traveller opens a drawer and takes out the

new calendar that reads:  "1900, Welcome New Century."

He flips a few pages to find the next Friday and jots

down the dinner engagement.  At this point Mrs. Watchett,

with his velvet smoking jacket over her arm, appears

in the doorway and walks up to him.

She turns to go as the Time Traveller calls after her.

Mrs. Watchett exits, closing the door after her.  Once

again the Time Traveller is alone.  He looks at the

old calendar that reads:  "December 3l. 1899," rips

the final sheet from the pad, crumples it into a tight

little ball and tosses it into the hearth where it

burns.  With slow and deliberate movements he replaces

the old calendar with the new one.  Then, he hastily

scribbles a note which he puts into an envelope and

places it prominently on the table.  He rises and

mounts the steps that lead to:

INT. CORRIDOR - MOVING SHOT                            62

The Time Traveller walks slowly toward a closed door

at the end of the passageway.  Here he pauses momentarily,

removes the key from his pocket, unlocks the door, then

slowly swings it open as the MUSIC STARTS the THEME of

the picture.

INT. LABORATORY - FULL SHOT - (NIGHT)                  63

The laboratory has the appearance of having once been

a greenhouse.  Only a few potted plants remain.  The

glass walls are obscured from view from the garden by

rows of tall growing plants.  Only the glass skylight

is clear.  Thick, dark, low-hanging clouds are pass-

ing beneath the moon, dimming its light and leaving

the interior a maze of dark shadows.  As the slow mov-

ing clouds pass overhead, a shaft of moonlight seeps

through and we SEE workbenches, numerous tools, sheets

of drawings and scientific instruments situated around

the perimeter.

But the most conspicuous object in the room is the

Time Machine.  It is a duplicate of the miniature model

already seen.

However, its size gives it a majestic quality.  Nickel,

ivory and crystalline quartz gleam and sparkle.  While

the miniature possessed a delicate, appealing note, the

full size Machine has an ominous look.  The wavering

moonlight seems to render it alive and give it the

power of movement.

CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                  64

Staring at the Machine, hypnotized by his own crafts-

manship, he locks the door with accustomed movement,

then crosses to a workbench and lights a candle.  Here

a crystalline lever is attached to a polishing buffer.

The Time Traveller sets it in motion, polishing the

crystal lever until its rough edges disappear and it

sparkles like a fine cut diamond.  As he works, his

lips purse and he softly STARTS TO WHISTLE the melancholy

strains of "The Land Of The Leal."  A clock near him on

the workbench reads:  "9:30."

Satisfied with the buffing, he removes the gleaming

handle and crosses to the Machine.  He settles into the

saddle and affixes the crystalline lever.  There is no

sign of urgency in his movements to betray that his

settling himself into the saddle is any more than a

routine position he has taken before to work on the

Machine.

Then he leans back in the saddle and gazes up at:

Passing clouds.

BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 66

He looks upwards for several moments.  Then his hand

slowly reaches forth and his fingers encircle the

lever. - Gently he urges it forward.

A HUMMING SOUND, similar to the one made by the model,

but MORE RESONANT starts and a soft glow wells up from

within the Machine.

INSERT:  THE CONTROL PANEL                             67

The luminous dials show:  "31 December 1899."  The

meters and indicators start to BUZZ and whirl.  The

glow increases.

BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 68

His expression is taut as he looks around, then down

to the control panel.

INSERT OF PANEL                                        69

The figures spin, the needles vibrate.  Then almost

at once the Time Traveller's hand reaches for the

lever and jerks it over to halt the Machine.  The

HUMMING LESSENS and FADES.

BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 70

As he starts to look up and around, slowly.

WHAT HE SEES - MOVING SHOT                             71

Starting at the WINDOW with frost around the edges

and icicles outside, we move around the room PASSING

THE WORKBENCH over to the DOOR.  During this we HEAR the:

THE CAMERA SWINGS BACK TO THE WORKBENCH, CLOSE, where

the clock now shows "11:09" and the candle has burned

shorter.

BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 72

He looks amazed, then pulls his old fashioned watch

from his pocket by its gold chain.  It flips open

showing almost "9:32."

Pleased, he puts his watch away and reaches for the

lever, looking off toward the:

WORKBENCH - (ANIMATION)                                73

The HUMMING SOUND STARTS again and, while the hands

of the clock circle the dial, the flame of the candle

flickers with the speed of a bee's wing, melting the

candle down.  The CAMERA MOVES to the window where the

frost has spread and the icicles continue to grow.

Light comes up behind so that the crystals glitter like

gems and the sun starts to rise.

TIME TRAVELLER IN THE MACHINE - MED. SHOT              74

The rays of the early Morning sun slide down the lab-

oratory wall and sweep across the Time Traveller and

his Machine.  A trace of a smile -- and then, he looks

up and squints.

the scene.

In the b.g. Mrs. Watchett leaps into the garden, pauses

the briefest instant to sprinkle the flowers, then with

the speed of wind streaks away.

His hand shoves the lever farther over toward the

future position.

THE HUMMING SOUND RISES TO HIGHER PITCH.  The Time

and looks at the dials.

His eyes gleam with a mad light, half pleasure, half

pain.  His face is illuminated by the alternating

flashes of light, each one indicating the passage of

another day.

He turns toward the:

WINDOW - FULL SHOT - (ANIMATION, STOP MOTION & STOCK)  82

Without a trace of frost or icicles.  The snow has

disappeared, replaced by the lush green of Spring.

While the vines of a morning Glory grow up and around

the window like a snake and the flowers open and close,

we see the following through repeated fast flashes.

BACK ON TIME TRAVELLER                                 83

Quick flashes of lightning on the Time Traveller's

face followed by a series of SHORT THUNDERCLAPS.

He applies greater pressure on the lever.  The

HUMMING INCREASES.  The alternate flashes of light

become a flicker almost too fast for the eye to

follow.  He looks o.s. and sees:

EXT. TREE IN GARDEN - FULL SHOT - (ANIMATION)          84

Its shadows, cast by the sun and the moon, dance

around the trunk, faster and faster -- the moon

passing through its phases and the sun shifting

its position with the seasons.

Leaves grow quickly.  Flowers appear and turn into

small green apples.  Growing larger, they turn red

disappear.  Suddenly the bare branches are covered

with snow for a few seconds, then again burst into

green leaves and blossoms.

EXT. DISTANT HILLSIDE - FULL SHOT - (ANIMATION)        86

Through the window we see the trees grow and

change like puffs of vapor -- now brown, now

green; they spread, shiver and pass away.  Snow

flashes across the country, vanishes and is

followed by the brief bright green of Spring.

Gradually soot, dirt and grime has built up on the

windows from the outside and darkness prevails.

CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                87

His brow is beaded with perspiration.  Alarmed,

he grabs the handle of the Time Machine.

INSERT:  THE DIALS                                     88

The hand of the Time Traveller quickly pulls back

the lever.

The flickering of passing days and nights slows and

the HUMMING SOUND GRADUALLY DIMINISHES.  The dial

stops on "13 September 1917".

TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             89

The CAMERA PULLS BACK as he steps out of his Machine

and glances with astonishment around the interior

of the laboratory.  The once clear windows are now

dirty and boarded up.  The world outside is

completely obscured from view.  Only faint light

penetrating cracks indicates that it is day out-

doors.  He crosses to the door.  Dust falls as he

opens it and enters the corridor.

INT. LIBRARY                                           90

The dim light and the protective sheets covering

the furnishings previously seen, lend the room a

ghostly appearance.  Tilted paintings reveal

faded spots on the walls and the dust is inches

thick here, as well as in the dining room seen

in the b.g.  Cobwebs are everywhere.

The floor SQUEAKS on every footfall as the Time

Traveller, coming down the steps from the

corridor, enters the room and looks about.

THE SHELVES - TIME TRAVELLER'S P.O.V.                  91

Among his books still rest the clocks, his once

prized possessions.  There is NO TICKING now.

The hands of the clocks, each pair indicating a

different time, seem to guard the past.

CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                  92

Curiosity takes the Time Traveller from the

library, through the ENTRANCE HALL, to the front

door.  It refuses to respond to his attempt to

open it.  Even when he uses his shoulder it does

not budge.  He steps back and flings his full

weight against it and with a WRENCHING SOUND it

gives slightly.  Under continued pressure the

nailed boards outside give way and a flood of

daylight illuminates the dusty interior.  The

Time Traveller moves into the open driveway that

The Time Traveller takes a deep breath and looks

curiously around.  Everything is overgrown with

vines and flowers.  The house is boarded up.  He

starts to wander around, thinking, investigating.

(NOTE:  The house is situated upon a site with

Suddenly the SOUND OF AN APPROACHING ENGINE

catches his attention.  He looks puzzled toward:

EXT. ROAD - LONG SHOT - (DAY)                          95

Coming up the hill on a narrow dusty road is a

car of 1916 vintage, with the HORN HONKING.  The

CAMERA PANS with it, up to a SMALL STORE across

the street.  The sign above the entrance reads:

"Filby's Department Store".  A MANNEQUIN,

dressed for the period, is in the window.  The

driver, in the uniform of a Second Lieutenant of

the First World War, steps out of the car.  The

Time Traveller walks over to see his old friend,

sans moustache.

TWO SHOT                                               96

The Time Traveller nods and James Filby slowly

turns and, glancing back repeatedly, enters the

Department Store.

He speaks almost to himself.

With the bitter taste of death for his old

friend, David Filby, he slowly walks across the

street and returns to the cottage.

INT. LABORATORY - FULL SHOT                            98

The Time Traveller approaches the Machine, steps

up into the seat, throws his head back and grimly

shoves the lever forward.

ACCENT on MUSIC, then as the HUMMING OF THE TIME

one after another, giving a clear view of a sky

full of SWIRLIING TURBULENT CLOUDS.

The FLICKERS of days and nights, as well as the

with his manipulation of the controls.  Over this:

Something catches his interest.  He pulls back

the lever to SLOW DOWN.

EXT. STREET - FULL SHOT - (NIGHT) - (STOP MOTION)      101

With the speed of wind, pedestrians streak across

the pavement.  The bright lights of the night pop

out one after another leaving a sparingly

illuminated street.  The HUMMING SUBSIDES.  The

mannequin previously seen in the show window now

wears the clothing of the "Roaring Twenties".  A

distant CLOCK STRIKES ELEVEN.

As the years speed by INTERRUPTED BY SHORT BLURS,

the dresses of the mannequin change.  The skirts

get shorter and shorter, then drop inch by inch

while the hair styles vary.  The bosom appears to

swell with the sinking neckline and flattens as

the neckline rises.  During this:

He looks down at the instruments.

The Time Traveller HEARS the SCREAMS of DIVING

PLANES.  He stops the Machine and looks up at:

Through the panes of broken glass we see a clear

but limited glimpse of the night sky that is

swept by beams of searching lights.

ANTI-AIRCRAFT batteries are FIRING as a squadron

of Nazi fighter planes are caught in the criss-

cross beams of light.  The sky is pierced with

ack ack.  Then, following the sound OF APPROACHING RAF.

FIGHTER PLANES, a dog fight ensues.  Several of the

planes are hit and plummet earthward, balls of

streaking flame and fire.

EXT. STREET IN 1966 - LONG SHOT - (DAY)                117

People are racing along the sidewalk.  The SOUND

OF MORE DEEP-THROATED SIRENS from all directions

comes over.  Drivers leave their cars of the period

in disorder.

The running is purposive, however.  All are entering

particular buildings or, like those closest to the

Time Traveller, are descending a stairway from the

sidewalk down below street level.  Some glance sky-

ward.

A LITTLE GIRL picks up the doll she has dropped

as her FATHER returns from the shelter.  He gathers

her up in his arms and rushes back to safety.

In a few seconds the streets are deserted.

TIME MACHINE AT EDGE OF PARK - FULL SHOT               118

The Time Traveller gets out and looks around,

confused.

He starts off toward the sidewalk, the CAMERA

MOVING with him.  At the descending subway stair-

way he stops and peers downward, but sees no one

below.  Meanwhile, through a loudspeaker o.s.,

a melodious SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA is heard softly,

until a BURST OF CHORDS attracts the Time Traveller's

attention.

A TELEVISION CABINET on display.  The set is

operating, showing a huge symphony orchestra

led by one of the popular conductors of tomorrow.

The CAMERA SWINGS to the modern ENTRANCE of FILBY'S

DEPARTMENT STORE just as the Time Traveller reaches

the two broad glass doors.  As he steps forward he

intercepts the rays of electronic eyes and the doors

fly wide open.

He stops startled, looking about to see who opened

them.  Seeing no one, he starts slowly forward.

INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - LONG SHOT                      120

From the TV set BLARES MUSIC that gradually becomes

the UNDERSCORE for the SCENE.  The Time Traveller

enters and turns his attention to other products

of tomorrow -- refrigerators, vacuum cleaners,

reducing belts, etc.  As his keen mind grasps the

significance of each, he smiles with approval, proud

of his fellow man.  His delight increases until he

is interrupted by APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS.  He looks

off.

REVERSE SHOT                                           121

Coming from the office is THE WARDEN, dressed in a

plastic suit.  He also wears an armband and a white

crash helmet, both bearing the insignia of "Civilian

Defense."  MUMBLES are heard from beneath his mask

as the CAMERA PANS him to the Time Traveller.

The warden takes off his helmet.  He is David

Filby's son, James, whom we saw in 1917 as a young

man.  He is now in his mid-sixties.

There is an insistent, EAR PIECING SIREN.  It

lasts for three seconds.

He grabs the Time Traveller by the arm and drags

him out.

He descends into the air raid shelter.

He looks puzzled.

The Time Traveller looks up as he hears the

APPROACHING SIRENS OF AN AMBULANCE.  Alarmed,

he runs across the street directly in the path

of the ambulance that threads its way between the

cars left in disorder on the road.  The driver

spins the steering wheel and the ambulance tilts

crazily in trying to avoid the Time Traveller.

Suddenly there is a BLINDING FLASH.  He stops and

looks startled.

A SATELLITE travels over the city in the distance.

The flash is followed by an EXPLOSION and a giant

cobalt mushroom begins to rise over the horizon.

As the Time Traveller tries again to rush toward

his Machine, the shockwaves reach him and throw him

to the ground.  He looks back, desperately.

THE CITY - LONG SHOT - (MINIATURE)                     126

Through the thick cloud of smoke and dust we see

the once proud city of the future in ruins.  Only

a single, large structure in the f.g. remains stand-

ing for a moment, then it also collapses in an instant.

The ground shudders with an OMINOUS sound and sudden

a great rent appears in the wide street ahead, as

though the earth were being torn apart.  It zig-zags

down the street and from the widening fissure clouds

of smoke and steam rise.

CHASM IN THE GROUND - (STOCK)                          127

The smoke and steam give way to a spluttering of

red hot lava which swells slowly at first in a

rising tide and then spilling over begins to

EXPLODE into the air.

With red hot lava swirling around the bases of the

remaining buildings.  The lower parts of the struct-

ures in the f.g. dissolve into smoke and flame and

the upper parts come tumbling down into the rising

red flood.  Then the incoming rush of the river

meets the flowing tide of lava.  The two opposite

elements, molten rock and cold green water, dwarf

the ruined city as they leap toward each other, and

meet with explosive fury.  The air is rent with the

SINGING HISS of water and the CRACKLING of cooling

rock.  Steam whitens the sky.

the HUMMING TIME MACHINE and the SLOW LABORED

BREATHING of the Time Traveller.

Then a match flickers.  The CAMERA SCARES BACK.  The

Time Traveller holds up a burning matchstick, his

face glistening with perspiration as he leans forward

to look at the dials.

he looks up.

The vapor rises like a curtain to disclose a great

bronze pedestal, green with verdigris, whereon

serpent.  A weeping birch tree barely touches its

outspread wings.

In the distance there is a building that might once

have been a temple.  Vines mat the ancient walls,

seemingly holding them together.

In the background across the hall, the Time Traveller

halts.  He is dwarfed by the height of the vaulted

ceiling.  Although ancient in appearance, everything

is ultra modern in design.  Sunlight streams through

windows where half the panes of stained glass are

broken.  Faded curtains droop in dusty folds along

the walls, and at random about the floor are low

tables, some heavily fractured, loaded with bowls

of fruit.

His FOOTSTEPS ECHO through the great hall as the

Time Traveller crosses to:

The Time Traveller glances down at the spread of

exotic fruit.  Everything looks fresh and clean as

though newly prepared.  Yet there is no indication

of life or sound, either human or animal.  The air

hangs in a deathlike stillness.  Slowly the Time

Traveller turns and looks around the walls, his

eyes searching, scrutinizing for some clue to

this strange place.  There is none.

Then he picks up an empty marble plate and POUNDS

with it on the top of the table.

But an ECHO is his only answer.  Curiously he re-

traces his steps and leaves the great hall.

possibly conceal some person or thing.

INTERCUT INSERTS of the various innocent objects

he looks at with CLOSEUPS of Time Traveller as he

reacts to the bewildering SILENCE and lack of life

or movement.

The continued stretch of emptiness builds up a wave

of apprehension in the Time Traveller which grows

as he moves along.  The apprehension mounts into

tension and gradually but inevitably approaches

the state of horror that a human being would

experience in a strange place where he had just

come from an innocent freshly set table of ripe

fruits and stepped outside into a beautiful but

weird vacuum.

he hesitates, then moves into the forest.

The trees are thick and deep shadows cut patches of

darkness through the bright sunlight which struggles

to penetrate the maze.  The Time Traveller walks

with continued wariness through the trees, glancing

from left to right and occasionally stopping dead

still and quickly darting a glance behind him at

what he imagines to be some sound of movement.

But all this is imaginary on his part.  There is

nothing that moves or makes a sound in this forest.

Suddenly he stops as he distinctly hears a familar

and quite HUMAN combination of NOISES.  The SOUND

SPLASHING WATER and LAUGHTER.  He hurries to some

dense foliage where he stops to cautiously peer out.

EXT. THE POOL - LONG SHOT - (DAY)                      167

The Time Traveller's VIEW is partially obscured by

the leaves.  At considerable distance upstream, the

PEOPLE OF THE FUTURE are swimming in a natural pool

and sunning themselves on a beach of white sand.

They are small, but delicately formed.  Their grace

and beauty fits perfectly into this splendid new

world.  The spot is also extremely lovely, surrounded

by fern trees, and with the water plunging into it

from a high waterfall.  Below the pool the stream

emerges in a swift torrent.

great hall.  The Time Traveller slowly follows them.

He pauses on the steps to see if any will turn back

to either welcome him or resent his intrusion, but

they move on with lack of interest, completely.  He

sits down on the steps, thoroughly perplexed at this

utter indifference.

TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             184

Seated on the steps leaning against a column.  He

senses another's presence, looks about, sees no one,

then turns to glance over his shoulder.  The Girl, now

wearing her robe and holding his jacket over her arm,

appears from behind the column.  He looks at her and

smiles reassuringly, but makes no move toward her. -

She comes closer, then sits on the step above him and

returns his jacket.  While he slowly slips it on,

she slides down a step to sit alongside him.

The Time Traveller is suddenly struck by the truth

of her words.  All of the little people seem to be

of the Girl's age or younger.

The Girl makes no reply.  Instead she gazes off at the

sun which is low in the heavens.  Shadows have already

fallen over the distant hills.

He bends over, picks up a stick and starts to draw

on the ground.

INSERT: DUST                                           185

As the stick writes out: " W E E N A "

BACK TO SCENE                                          186

She shows little interest.

INSERT OF DUST                                         187

The stick now writes in the dust: " E L O I "

BACK TO SCENE                                          188

A shadow crosses her face.  Suddenly she springs

to her feet, concerned.

She grabs his hand and pulls him toward:

INT. THE GREAT HALL - LONG SHOT - (MATTE?) - (DAY)     189

Crowded now.  The people of the future are sitting

on cushions around the tables, having their evening

meal.  The glowing orange light of the setting sun

pierces the broken windows, lending a curious at-

mosphere to the place.  No one pays attention to

Weena or to the Time Traveller as they enter in the

b.g.

AT THE MAIN TABLE - MED. SHOT                          190

A score of attractive young men and young women are

enjoying their dinner.  There is a general atmos-

phere of bubbling good humor.  They don't even look

up as Weena and the Time Traveller sit down at the

table.  She hands him an orange-sized raspberry.  He

takes it, looks at the Young Man and the Man in White

who sit across the table from him and tries to engage

them in conversation.

Looks around for some kind of a reaction.  There is

none.

CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                191

He bites into the fruit.  It's good.  While he is

eating he searches for another way to bring up the

subject.

GROUP SHOT                                             192

There is no reaction, so he addresses the Young Man

again.

The Man in White looks at the Young Man beside him.

They both shrug their shoulders.

He rises and beckons.  The Time Traveller's brow

clears.

He too gets up and follows the Young Man.

AT THE WALL - LONG SHOT                                193

The Young Man leading.  He reaches the wall and

seizes an ancient curtain which covers it.  A

cloud of dust rises as he tugs it aside and the

curtain falls, almost crumbling.  Shelves and

shelves of books are disclosed.  The books are

old even though many of them have futuristic de-

signs.  The bindings of once proud volumes hang in

brown tatters.  The Time Traveller steps to the

books.

CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                194

The realization of the true state of affairs shows

on his face.  He is appalled.  Carefully he pulls

a volume from the shelf.  Its binding breaks as

he opens it and, when his hand touches the pages,

they crumple like ashes and drift to the floor.

He drops the book.  His voice is a shocked WHISPER.

With sudden violence he slams his fist into a whole

shelf of books.  His hand plows through them and

the dust swirls into the air.  He turns back in

anger.

With one hand he grabs the Young Man and shakes him.

He releases him and leaves.

THE HALL - MOVING SHOT                                 195

The Time Traveller stomps among the Eloi, hating

them for their dissipation.

Without emotion they watch him walk toward the

entrance.  Only Weena jumps to her feet.  Her

former indifference is gone.

AT THE ENTRANCE                                        196

From the top step, the Time Traveller looks down

at them.

He turns and strides toward the door.

EXT. ENTRANCE - MED. SHOT - (DUSK)                     197

The Time Traveller bursts out of the building.  A

moment later Weena appears in the archway.  She

stands there, looking after him.

EXT. FOREST - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT)                      198

There are patches of mist and haze between the

trees.  With a blazing torch the Time Traveller

strides across.

EXT. TIME TRAVELLER ON THE PATH - (NIGHT)              199

Coming from the distance the CAMERA PANS HIM TO

THE EDGE OF LAWN, where he stops short, jerking

the pipe from his mouth, his eyes wide with con-

sternation.  He raises the torch high to see:

EXT. THE LAWN - FULL SHOT - (NIGHT)                    200

There is no Time Machine.

CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                201

In stunned shock.

THE PATH - FULL SHOT                                   202

Holding his torch high, the Time Traveller hurries

toward the bushes around the edge of the lawn

looking for his Machine, beating the branches with

his free hand.  After he passes one of the bushes,

a white indistinct creature dashes out of it and

disappears in the darkness.  Unaware of this, the

Time Traveller stops in the mindle of the lawn

where the Machine was last seen.

(NOTE:  The surrounding is suggestive of the spot

He looks about, slowly turning in a complete circle.

Meanwhile the CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE.  Then, sud-

denly remembering, he digs his free hand into the

pocket of his trouser, drawing out the lever he

had removed and looks at it with self-assurance.

Returning the lever to his pocket, he drops to his

knees and by the light of his torch, scrutinizes

the grass.

THE GROUND - TIME TRAVELLER'S P.O.V.                   203

The turf has been ripped in parallel grooves as

though some heavy object had been dragged across.

CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY FORWARD following these grooves

and HALTS where small misshapen, half-human foot-

prints stand out clearly in the freshly turned

earth.

TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                           204

He straightens slowly, his eyes narrowed.

Nervously he looks around, then steps on follow-

ing the grooves.

BACK TO THE FOOTPRINTS                                 205

THE CAMERA CONTINUES TO FOLLOW the grooves

straight across the lawn to the flagstones around

the white sphinx.  There are dark scratches on the

stones leading to the wide panel in the base of

the pedestal.  Here the marks end.

AT THE PEDESTAL - MED. SHOT                            206

The Time Traveller pauses, then gives the panel an

exploratory KNOCK.  It responds with a HOLLOW SOUND.

The Time Traveller thrusts his torch between the

claws of the sphinx.  With both hands now free,

he tries unsuccessfully to push the panel either

to right or left or up or down.  Taking a penknife

from his pocket, he runs the blade around the panel's

edge hunting for a secret latch.  No success.

Then he pauses, searching for a tool, and sees a

loosened flagstone.  He picks it up.  With this

heavy weight he batters the panel.  At each blow

it RESOUNDS LOUDLY, not unlike a gong.  Four times

he strikes, and then on the fifth blow the rock

shatters in his hands.  He stops in despair.

CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                207

He senses he is under observation by an unseen

presence.  Alarmed, he whips around then looks up

to:

THE SPHINX - LOW ANGLE - (MINIATURE OR MATTE)          208

The marble face looks baleful, almost smiling in

the torch light.

BACK ON TIME TRAVELLER                                 209

He turns and peers toward:

THE BUSHES                                             210

In the shadows, beyond reach of the light, is a

wide semi-circle of luminous eyes, reflecting the

flame of the torch.

TIME TRAVELLER - FULL SHOT                             211-213

He grabs his torch from the pedestal and slowly

paces toward the nearest bush.  But as he ap-

proaches, the glowing eyes vanish in the haze,

followed by a ghostly impression of pale,

fleeing creatures.

The Time Traveller halts and turns in another

direction.  The same thing happens.

Then he has an idea.  Bending, he beats the torch

against the moist soil and extinguishes it.  Now

in the darkness he straightens and waits, peering

around until he hears a twig CRACK, then moves

into the deep shadow of a tall bush, looking off.

THE PATH                                               214

Through the mist in the foliage a pale figure

approaches slowly.  It emerges onto the lawn.

TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             215

The CAMERA FOLLOWS as he leaps forward, grapples the

other figure and bears it to earth.  For a moment

there is a struggle and then the other figure lies

perfectly still.  The Time Traveller rears back to

get a look at it.

THE FIGURE ON THE GROUND - EXTREME CLOSE SHOT          216

It is Weena.  The moving shadow of the Time Traveller

reveals her pale face, with closed eyes, wearing an

expression of helpless terror.  She appears to be

waiting for the inevitable end, but when it does

not come, she slowly opens her eyes.  She sees the

Time Traveller and her face records a wave of

relief.

The CAMERA WITHDRAWS TO TWO SHOT as the Time

Traveller, embarrassed, helps her sit up.

A look of fear comes into her eyes.  She drifts

her gaze away from his, too frightened to answer.

Gently he takes her by the shoulders and turns

her to face him.

Again Weena drops her eyes from him, but he cups

his hand beneath her chin and tenderly turns her

head back so that her eyes meet his.

Weena looks up at him, her fears dwindling, find-

ing comfort in this strange being whom she cannot

understand.  Then she glances high into the dark sky

and the old fear returns.

THE LAWN AND THE BASE - LONG SHOT                      217

Reluctantly she helps him collect a few twigs which

she hands over to him.

Meanwhile, Weena has seated herself near the

bushes in the f.g.

CLOSE ON WEENA                                         218

She watches every move he makes.

Meanwhile a pair of pale, hairy hands rise slowly

from behind her.

TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             219

With his back turned, he is piling up the sticks.

BACK TO WEENA                                          220

The hairy hands grab her shoulders.  The fear

paralyzes her.  She is unable to scream.

BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 221

He is about to light a match, but finds he needs

more wood.  Without turning he calls back to Weena.

When there is no answer he turns and looks.

AT THE BUSHES                                          222

Weena is gone.  The CAMERA ZIPS TO LEFT, then to

RIGHT and finally STOPS on the limp legs of Weena

slowly disappearing under the brush.

TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                           223

We hear the RUSTLING OF BRANCHES and quick DIMINISHING

FOOTSTEPS as the CAMERA RUSHES with the Time Traveller

toward the bush.  He helps Weena to her feet and draws

her to the pile of dry branches.

CLOSE ON WEENA                                         224

She gazes into the fire, with fascination.  Slowly

she raises her hand and reaches out to grasps the

flame.

TWO SHOT                                               225

The Time Traveller grabs her hand.  It is almost

too late.  She looks at her burned hand with more

amazement than pain.

Apparently no harm done, the Time Traveller releases

her hand.  He shakes his head in amazement and sits

down beside her.

ANOTHER ANGLE                                          226

The Time Traveller is staring into the fire stirring

the glowing embers as he speaks slowly and with

compassion, hoping to arouse some feeling within

her, even though she may not grasp the meaning of

the words.

During his speech Weena has cuddled close to him,

her cheek touching his knee.  He looks down at her

and sees he has made a friend.  He places his hand

gently on her hair.  She looks up, her eyes no

longer showing fear.  Their faces are illuminated

by the dancing flames.

THE FIRE - CLOSE SHOT                                  227

It CRACKLES reassuringly.

EXT. WELL - FULL SHOT - (DAY)                          228

The ring of flames from the previous scene is

seemingly replaced by a dark, circular shaft from

which comes the low THROBBING of some GIANT

MACHINES, pounding, beating monotonously.  The

CAMERA MOVES BACK to include the LANDSCAPE

where more wells are visible in the distance,

each surrounded by a low, porcelain wall.  Their

roofs are shining brass-like disks.

Across the field, from the direction of the sphinx,

approach the Time Traveller, carrying his jacket

over his shoulder, and a few steps behind, Weena.

Weena, concerned, stands back as the Time Traveller

walks up to the well in the f.g. and peers down into:

THE SHAFT - HIGH ANGLE                                 229

It descends into darkness, but near the top can be

seen handholds in an irregular pattern.  The

THROBBING OF MACHINES is ominous.

CLOSE ON WEENA                                         231

She shakes her head.

The CAMERA EASES BACK to include the Time Traveller

as he reaches her.

Weena nods and starts off.  He follows her.

INT. GREAT HALL - FULL SHOT - (DAY)                    232

Deserted, until Weena leads the Time Traveller past

the tables toward the shelves of crumbling books

that the Young Man had previously shown him.

She enters an archway and walks up a dark stone

corridor.  He follows.

INT. STONE CORRIDOR - MED. SHOT                        233

Weena leading the Time Traveller up the corridor

where it veers sharply to the right.  They disappear

around the corner.

INT. GREEN MUSEUM - LONG SHOT - (DAY) - (MATTE)        234

The Time Traveller and Weena stop at the threshold of

a huge museum-like room, all done in a greenish

colored porcelain-like substance.  There are no

windows, but the vaulted ceiling has a transparent

dome where the sun's rays, changing with the course

of day, illuminate the entire museum.  It is

evidently a place that no one bothers to visit.

TIME TRAVELLER & WEENA - MOVING SHOT                   235

Their feet kick up small flurries of dust as they

walk among exhibitions of a long bygone era still

existent behind plastic.  Some of the cases are

broken and their contents, exposed to the atmos-

phere, have decayed, crumbled to dust.  We recognize

objects and machines, some belonging to the early

part of the twentieth century and still others take

on the forms and shapes that the audience of today

will recognize as contemporary.  Then they pass

cabinets that hold objects of a time far beyond

comprehension.

Weena finally leads the Time Traveller to a broken

case which contains several boxes of golden rings

a few inches in diameter and one inch wide, lined

with minutely spaced grooves.  He picks up the

nearest box and examines its contents.

Weena takes the ring from the Time Traveller and

lays it on a smooth topped porcelain block on its

edge, like a coin, and spins it like a top.

INSERT:  WHIRLING RING                                 236

A VOICE emerges from the spinning ring as the current

of air flows through its grooves, much like a phono-

graph needle evokes sound as it plays through the

surface of one of our records.

TWO SHOT                                               237

The Time Traveller is listening in fascination and

Weena in disinterested detachment.

The last few WORDS DECREASE IN VOLUME and FADE AWAY.

The Time Traveller eagerly reaches into the case for

the second ring and spins it.

The VOICE from the ring DWINDLES and is heard no

more.  The Time Traveller quickly picks up the

third and last ring and spins it.  NO WORDS are

heard -- only the SOUND of MARCHING FOOTSTEPS over

floors of stone -- then a deadly SILENCE.

Over this:

He turns.

The Time Traveller paces across the hall.  Weena

hurries after him.

They exit.

GREAT HALL - FULL SHOT                                 240

The Time Traveller, followed by Weena, walks from

the book shelves toward the entrance.

They leave the Great Hall.

EXT. LANDSCAPE - FULL SHOT - (DAY)                     241

The Time Traveller strides toward one of the wells.

Weena senses his intention and catches up with him

to grasp his arm.

He shakes her off.

AT MOUTH OF WELL - MED. SHOT                           242

The Time Traveller places his jacket on the wall.

Then into the well he drops a dry leaf which, instead

of fluttering slowly down, is at once sucked out of

sight by the current from the shaft.  Then he looks

around and finds a pebble, drops it down the well and

listens.

After a PLOP is heard he puts his arm down the

shaft as far as it goes, feeling its surface, then

throws his leg over the porcelain wall and starts

to descend.  Weena rushes to his side to stop him.

Weena shakes her head and, as though giving him

a farewell gift, thrusts a large blossom into his

pocket.  The Time Traveller smiles as he dis-

appears.

FROM THROAT OF WELL - LOW ANGLE                        243

Locking from below, the top of the well appears

like a small blue disk with Weena peering down.

The Time Traveller gropes his way.

Suddenly from the far distance comes the SOUND of

LOW but POWERFUL SIREN.  Weena straightens.

CLOSE ON WEENA                                         244

An expression of fear comes slowly over her face

as the LOW SIREN is joined by ANOTHER of HIGHER

PITCH.  The Two make a grating dissonance.  Slowly

she turns in the direction of the sound.

He looks up, concerned, pausing in his descent.

BACK TO WEENA                                          246

As the THIRD DISCORDANT BLAST joins the other two,

Weena's fear is gone.  In its place is an expres-

sion of utter resignation.  Like someone in a

trance she opens her eyes and stares straight

ahead.  Then, as though she is summoning all her

strength to go through some ordeal, she starts

walking away.  The CAMERA PANS and we see the breeze

ripple her silken robe about her as she moves.

The DIRGE-LIKE MELODY becomes LOUDER, pulsating,

as he pauses to watch:

EXT. EDGE OF FOREST - LONG SHOT - (DAY)                251

Emerging from the forest are two Eloi, a man and

a woman.  They are several paces apart and pay no

attention to one another.  Both have exactly the

same manner as Weena.  They walk along, eyes

straight ahead, faces expressionless.

In the open country now, the forest behind them.

In their colorful robes, the Eloi march slowly

across the green landscape.

All are converging toward a single point somewhere

ahead.

WEENA AMONG ELOI                                       255

They walk close together, paying no attention to one

another, following the command of the MELANCHOLY

STRAINS OF THE SIRENS.

It is the source of the sound.  There are little

bursts of vapor from the tops of the sirens as

they repeat their tones, like a fantastic pipe

organ behind the Sphinx.

TIME TRAVELLER AND ELOI                                258

All of them walk in the same direction.  The Time

Traveller looks this way and that, bewildered.

But the Eloi disregard him and march straight

ahead, eyes forward.

The Time Traveller breaks into a run.

TWO SHOT                                               259

The Time Traveller overtakes the Young Man, seizes

his arm and jerks him to a halt.  Around them pass

the shadows of the marching Eloi.

The Young Man shows no emotion as he struggles to

free himself.  His movements are almost mechanical.

This unnerves the Time Traveller.  He stares at

him, releasing his grip.

The moment the Young Man is free, he faces about

and continues his march.  The Time Traveller re-

mains motionless, watching him go.  The ECHOING

SIRENS are now getting on his nerves.

EXT. LANDSCAPE - EXTREME LONG SHOT - (DAY) - (SPLIT?)  261

From all directions the Eloi in their bright robes

are moving, singly and in long files.  The impres-

sion is one of vastness -- a feeling that mankind

is marching to some unknown doom.

TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                           262

He spots a girl, rushes up, grabs her from behind.

But it is not Weena.  Disappointed, he releases

her, then goes on again, covering his ears with

his palms, fighting to retain command of his own

reason.

He still strives to control himself, moves forward,

then pauses in amazement, looking straight ahead.

EXT. THE SPHINX - FULL SHOT - (DAY) - (MATTE)          267

It is toward the white sphinx that the Eloi have

been marching.  But now the panel, upon which the

Time Traveller had pounded so hard, is wide open,

revealing a dark entrance into the pedestal.

And despite their previous repugnance to the

Sphinx, all of the people are now marching across

the lawn resolutely to it.

AT THE PEDESTAL - LONG SHOT                            268

The Young Man is the first to reach it.  He enters

the wide opening and starts descending into sub-

terranean darkness.  Others follow, Weena among

them.

Without hearing him she passes through the entrance.

TIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                           269

He desperately pushes forward, elbowing his way

past others in his haste to overtake Weena.  The

crowd impedes his progress and he shoves the

Eloi impatiently aside as he fights on.

THE PANEL                                              270

Slowly closing and the sound of the SIRENS gradually

DIES AWAY.  The Time Traveller reaches the panel as

it shuts tight before he can touch it.  He spreads

his palms against it in despair, then turns to face

those Eloi who, like him, are locked outside.  What

he sees astonishes him.

GROUP OF ELOI                                          271

They no longer approach the sphinx.  The ceasing of

the sirens seems to have released them from their

hypnotic spell and now, awake again and frightened,

they are retreating.

As he goes after them to the edge of the flagstones

and calls out angrily.

BACK TO ELOI                                           273

Featuring the Man in White in the f.g.  They halt

and stare back.  The Time Traveller's voice comes

over like a whip.

None of the Eloi answer.

TOWARD THE SPHINX - FULL SHOT                          274

Beyond several Eloi the Time Traveller stands in

the shadow of the white sphinx.  He steps slowly

forward onto the lawn, looking around the big

semi-circle of his audience.

TIME TRAVELLER - MED SHOT                              275

MAN IN WHITE                                           276

He looks ominously at the Time Traveller.

Unimpressed, the crowd begins to disperse, the Man

in White following them.

BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 277

Calling after them.

He sees that the situation is hopeless.

He runs off.

SERIES OF SHOTS                                        278

The Time Traveller running through the forest.         (a)

He is laboring up the open hillside.                   (b)

The Eloi in a semi-circle silently watch.  A few       (c)

of them hesitantly start after the Time Traveller.

EXT. THE WELL - FULL SHOT - (DAY)                      279

Arriving, the Time Traveller pauses to catch his

breath, picks up a piece of wood that could serve

as a torch, then jumps over the wall and starts

to descend.

Over this a faint THROBBING OF MACHINES can be

heard.

SHOOTING INTO SHAFT - HIGH ANGLE                       280

The Time Traveller climbs down, gripping the walls

with his hands and feet.  The depth beneath him is

dizzying.  THROBBING LOUDER.

IN THE WELL - FULL SHOT                                281

As the Time Traveller descends, the CAMERA FOLLOWS

him, step after step.  The deeper he goes, the darker

it becomes and the THROBBING OF MACHINES INCREASES as

well.

Suddenly a rock gives beneath his weight.  He barely

saves himself.  Not without fear he pauses to rest,

glancing upward.

FROM THE THROAT OF WELL - LOW ANGLE                    282

A couple of the curious Eloi peer downward, watching

the Time Traveller's progress.

BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 283

A metal ladder affixed to the wall brings him finally

to the opening of a transverse passageway.  In almost

complete darkness he steps from the ladder into the

tunnel and pauses to take the piece of wood from his

belt, but decides not to light it.  He bends and peers

ahead.

INT. GREAT CAVERN - FULL SHOT                          283X1

The Time Traveller emerges onto the bridge in the b.g.,

pausing for a moment to survey the surroundings, then

starts slowly down the staircase carved along the wall.

The gloom is relieved only by puffing smoke and waver-

ing lights, revealing occasionally vague shapes and

grotesque shadows.

(NOTE:  DRIPPING WATER from the walls and THROBBING OF

CLOSE ON T.T. - MOVING SHOT                            283X2

Walking, he notices an opening ahead and cautiously

moves toward:

INT. ENTRANCE TO FEASTING ROOM - FULL SHOT             283X3

At the threshold of this dark, silent cell the T.T.

pauses, then slowly enters.  Behind him, across the

cavern, an indistinct figure watches, but quickly

disappears as the T.T. strikes a match.  The sight

that the T.T. beholds fills him with revulsion and

horror.

THE FEASTING ROOM - T.T.'S P.O.V.                      283X4

This is obviously a feasting place of the Morlocks.

In the flickering light we see stone tables and

scattered around the floor far below the unmistak-

able remains of human bones after the flesh has been

carnivorously picked away.

CLOSE ON T.T.                                          283X5

His features twisted in horror in the flickering

light of his match.

The match dies between his fingers.  Suppressing a

shudder, the T.T. turns and as he leaves this chamber

of horror, the rock behind him comes to life.  A pale,

spectral Morlock crosses the screen in the f.g.

descending.  Another in the b.g. does likewise.

MACHINES - FULL SHOT                                   283X6

Morlocks, their indistinct bodies obscene in their

mockery of the human form, labor endlessly tending

the needs of their machinery.  They look up toward the

intruder as they HEAR his APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS, then

hide.

STAIRWAY - MOVING SHOT                                 283X7

The T.T. slowly descends the slender stone stairway

that hugs the sheer wall.  Meanwhile at the base of

the feasting room under the stairway on which the T.T.

is moving a Morlock moves a curtain aside and reveals

itself.  It silently watches as another Morlock

appears at the top of the stairs and follows.

Passing near the T.T.'s hiding place.  Weena and the

Young Man are side by side.

AT THE MACHINES                                        283X16

The Morlocks who followed the T.T. are closing in.

BACK TO T.T. - MOVING SHOT                             283X17

He is unaware of the Morlocks behind him.  Hugging

the rock, he makes his way to the closest possible

point where he can still remain unobserved by the

herding Morlocks and get Weena's attention.  He

reaches out.

But she continues on with complete resignation to her

fate.  Unmindful of his own safety, he leaves his hid-

ing place and grasps her by the shoulders.

As the T.T. pulls Weena toward the staircase, the

Young Man follows.

The CAMERA MOVES with the T.T., Weena and the Young

Man as they are forced to retreat.

AT ENTRANCE OF FEASTING ROOM                           283X20

Where other Morlocks with CRACKING WHIPS herd the Eloi

into the chamber of horrors.

One of the Morlocks spots the T.T., Weena and the

Young Man.  He swings his whip.

BACK TO THREE SHOT                                     283X21

The CAMERA MOVES with them as vicious CRACKING

WHIPS drive them back to the entrance of the

feasting room.

TWO SHOT                                               283X22

The T.T. tries to protect Weena.  Suddenly a long

lash of a whip strikes like a serpent and coils

about the T.T.'s neck.  He drops his unlit torch

and whirls in pain.

Another whip scares Weena into the chamber of

horrors, while several other whips land on the T.T.'s

shoulders.  Finally he grabs the whip from around

his neck and jerks it, wrenching it free.

AT THE ENTRANCE OF FEASTING ROOM                       283X23

The T.T., wielding the whip fiercely, drives the

Morlocks back several paces, then suddenly from

above a pale body of a Morlock lands on him,

knocking him down, causing him to drop the whip.

On the ground the cowardly Morlock stumbles

away leaving the T.T. a prey to the battery of

CRACKING WHIPS.  He crawls in pain into the

chamber of horrors.

GROUPSHOT INSIDE FEASTING ROOM                         283X24

The T.T. comes to his feet among the Eloi.  The

WHIPS HAVE STOPPED, then the silence is broken by

the GROWL of approaching MORLOCKS.  Through the

curtains, dark shapes swarm toward them.  Then

suddenly the T.T. pulls out his matchbox from his

pocket.  A match flares!

GROUP OF MORLOCKS                                      283X25

In the glare of yellow light we see the leprous

figures of blinded Morlocks, dropping their whips,

shielding their eyes.

THROUGH MORLOCKS'S EYES - (OPTICAL EFFECT)             283X26

The T.T.'s hand with the burning match rapidly zooms

into the center of the picture in a BLINDING FLASH

turning the screen momentarily white, then yellow

and red.  Then the CAMERA MOVES BACK indicating the

Morlocks' retreat.  Slowly the normal colors

reappear.

BACK TO THE GROUP OF MORLOCKS                          283X27

Regaining their sight in the darkness, they start

to close in.

THROUGH MORLOCKS'S EYES - (OPTICAL EFFECT)             283X28

Followed by the Eloi the T.T. exits the feasting

room and again lights a match.  A BLINDING FLASH

starting from the flame as a center engulfs the screen,

momentarily white again, then yellow, finally red.

Once more the CAMERA RETREATS, then still seeing

through the Morlocks' eyes the CAMERA ZOOMS CLOSE

ON THE MATCH BOX and the scaley hand of a Morlock

slaps all the matches except one to the floor.

T.T. - MED. SHOT                                       283X29

He lights his last match and moves forward, looking

for his lost torch.

GROUPSHOT                                              283X30

The T.T. leads the Eloi toward the stairway, the

light of the match his only weapon in keeping the

Morlocks away.  Finally he spots his torch and

picks it up hurriedly.

CLOSE ON T.T.                                          283X31

His face streams with sweat and is taut with appre-

hension while he applies the dying match to the

intended torch.

He holds the match steady, but it burns lower and

lower without starting the wood.  In despair he

turns to Weena.

BACK TO THE MORLOCKS                                   283X32

As they are closing in.

CLOSE ON WEENA                                         283X33

With a fierce gesture she rips open the loose sleeve

of her robe, tears off a piece of cloth and holds

it out.

BACK TO T.T.                                           283X34

As match is about to die, he holds it beneath the

cloth.  It flames up and he seizes it, dropping the

dead match.

He holds the burning cloth beneath the wood and

in this hotter flame it begins to burn.  Once it

starts he again attempts to make his way by blind-

ing the Morlocks and leads the Eloi to the stairway.

GROUPSHOT                                              283X35

As the Eloi slowly make their way toward the stairway,

one Morlock gains courage, and with his long whip

strikes the torch out of the T.T.'s hand.

A CORNER                                               283X36

The torch rolls in and begins to sputter.

BACK TO SCENE                                          283X37

The Eloi huddle against the wall in terror as other

Morlocks gain courage and move forward toward the

T.T.  As they face one another, the fight begins.

turns searching for the flickering torch.

As he turns to fight with Morlock on ledge.

Morlock swings at him.  He ducks and almost

falls off ledge.  He grabs Morlock, and hangs

on until he can scramble up on ledge again.

He clutches at Morlock's throat, banging his

head against the rock wall, finally throwing

him off ledge.  At the same time another Mor-

lock appears on ledge, while the Morlock he

had previously kicked rises to menace him from

the other side.  The Time Traveller jumps across

cavern to ramp and starts down toward the floor,

trying to get back to his torch, his only weapon

against the Morlocks.

CLOSE SHOT - THE TIME TRAVELLER                        351X7

He pauses momentarily against Rock Wall.  He

sees Eloi, still huddled in a group, apparently

too confused to move.

Weena spots the still flickering torch and

starts toward it.

INSERT OF TORCH                                        351X9

Lying on ground, still burning, Weena bends

down to pick up torch, when suddenly a Morlock

appears facing her.  She screams and jumps back,

watching in terror, as the Morlock comes toward

her.

MED. SHOT                                              351X10

The Time Traveller comes down ramp to meet several

Morlocks converging on him.  He tries to fight his

way past them.

CLOSE SHOT - WEENA AND YOUNG MAN                       351X11

Morlock rushes in, grabs Weena and carrying her

and runs toward her.

FULL SHOT                                              351X13

The Time Traveller runs to Weena, pulls her away

from Morlock, knocks him against rock.  In the

meantime another Morlock runs up on rock and

jumps at Time Traveller, knocking him down.

The second Morlock rebounds from rock and leaps

on the Time Traveller and starts to choke him.

CLOSE SHOT - TIME TRAVELLER                            351X14

Looks up toward YOUNG MAN - silently appeals for

help.

CLOSE SHOT - YOUNG MAN                                 351X15

Stancing in front of group of Eloi returns the

Time Traveller's silent plea for help.  Slowly

raises his right hand, stares at it as he

gradually clenches it into a fist.  Then, making

up his mind, raises both hands and strikes Mor-

lock hard on the back of his neck.

MED. SHOT                                              351X16

As Morlock relaxes his grip the Time Traveller

kicks him back to rock, scrambles up and runs

to get his torch.  Several Morlocks try to herd

Eloi back into Feasting Cave, but led by the

Young Man and his newly discovered strength, the

Eloi resist them.  The Time Traveller runs back

in with torch, and herd the Eloi toward stairs.

FULL SHOT                                              351X17

The Time Traveller urges the Eloi up the stairs

pushing Weena ahead of him.  They climb up past

Cauldron.  Morlocks come in after fleeing Eloi,

shielding their eyes from the light of the Time

Traveller's torch.

CLOSER SHOT                                            351X18

The Time Traveller looks ahead to be sure the

Eloi are all on their way out.  Then turns back

and drops his torch into the oil flowing into

the Cauldron.

FULL SHOT                                              351X19

The burning torch catches the Cauldron on

fire, which quickly spreads across the floor

of the Cavern, to the steaming Machine on

the right, which explodes.  The Time Traveller

herds Eloi out across Stone Bridge.

MED. SHOT                                              351X20

Pursuing Morlock runs up steps in back of

burning Cauldron hiding his face from the

flames.  He bumps into the Pipe coming down

the wall, loses his balance and falls into

the burning Cauldron - Flames shoot higher.

PAN SHOT                                               351X21

Another Morlock comes from behind machine, as

fire creeps across floor, almost reaches machine

at same time as fire - and it explodes.  Morlock

catches fire and runs across into Feasting Cave.

PASSAGEWAY - LONG SHOT                                 352

Smoke is thick as the Time Traveller and Weena

run toward a circle of light on the floor far

ahead.

CIRCLE OF LIGHT - HIGH ANGLE                           353

Weena and the Time Traveller reach the light

that comes straight down from above, and look

up the shaft.  Smoke belches from the passage-

way as he helps her start up the ladder and

then he, himself, follows, clambering out of

sight.

IN THE WELL                                            354

The CAMERA FOLLOWS Weena and the Time Traveller

climbing up, COUGHING from smoke.  The light

becomes slowly brighter and he looks up.

FROM THROAT OF WELL - LOW ANGLE                        355

Gradually the top of the well becomes visible

through the swirling smoke.  The Young Man is

peering down.  He reaches to help Weena and the

Time Traveller.

SHOOTING INTO SHAFT - HIGH ANGLE                       356

Weena and the Time Traveller are both dark with

soot, near exhaustion.  Far below them red flames

pierce through the smoke.  They each in turn grasp

the helping hand of the Young Man and climb up out

of the well.

EXT. THE WELL - MED. SHOT - (SUNSET)                   357

As their eyes meet, the Time Traveller grips the

Young Man's shoulder and gives it a brief shake

of approval.

The Time Traveller then grabs up branches and twigs,

carries them to the mouth of the well, ignites the

pile of kindling with his torch and drops the burn-

ing wood down in to the well.

SHOOTING INTO SHAFT - HIGH ANGLE                       358

The burning wood drops to the bottom where it ignites

the oil with a burst of flame that shoots up the well.

BACK TO SCENE                                          359

The Time Traveller picks up his jacket and points to

the other wells.  The Young Man first, then the rest of

the Eloi grasp the idea.  They also light branches

from the torch and dash for the various wells to

duplicate the Time Traveller's action.

VARIOUS SHOTS OF ELOI                                  360-362

Carrying bundles of burning wood to the mouths of

wells and dumping the fire below.

TWO SHOT                                               363

With Weena at his side, the Time Traveller gazes on

with approval at the Eloi's work.

EXT. LANDSCAPE - FULL SHOT - (SUNSET)                  364

It is dotted with wells, each of which has been

turned into a fiery furnace shooting flames and

smoke up from the burning oil below, preventing

the Morlocks from any avenue of escape to the

surface of the Earth.

A WELL - (MINIATURE)                                   365

It falls with a CRASH to the ground and begins to

spew smoke and flame into the undergrowth of the

forest nearby.

EXT. ENTRANCE TO GREAT BUILDING - LONG SHOT -          366

(SUNSET)

Smoke drifts out of its windows.  The Eloi hurry

out, led by the Man in White.  They stop and stare

at the sight of the Morlock world being destroyed

below.

EXT. THE BLAZING FOREST - (SUNSET) - (STOCK)           367-368

The sun on the horizon is a dim red ball through

the smoke.  Several trees fall over, blazing.  LOW

UNDERGROUND RUMBLING is heard.

WEENA AND THE TIME TRAVELLER                           369

They start down the hill after the Eloi, seeking

safety together.  Suddenly a DISTANT RUMBLE OF THE

EARTH makes them pause and look o.s.

EXT. LANDSCAPE - FULL SHOT - (DUSK) - (MINIATURE)      370

Then comes a SERIES OF TREMBLORS, each more powerful

than the one before.  The earth shudders and the

blazing forest begins to collapse.  It does

not explode into the air.  Rather, the solid

earth seems to give way so that the entire

surface of the ground begins to fall into the

subterranean chambers.

ANOTHER ANGLE - (MINIATURE)                            371

A section of the earth sheers away and falls

in an ever widening rift.

As it is swallowed by the earth, followed by a

belch of steam.

BACK TO LANDSCAPE - (MINIATURE)                        373

Leveled off by the earthquake.  There are no more

flowers, no more buildings, wells, smokestacks or

obelisks.  There is no movement -- only the

flickering of low flames and the smoke driven by

the gentle breeze.

GROUP OF ELOI                                          374

Staring into the vast destruction.

He holds her hand.  The CAMERA MOVES IN SLOWLY and

we begin to hear the

He looks o.s.

GROUP OF ELOI                                          376

The Man in White, with others, approaches the group

headed by the Young Man.  The two men look at each

other, their gestures and expressions showing their

joy at release from centuries of fear.

BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER AND WEENA                       377

He looks down to Weena and we HEAR:

The CAMERA MOVES CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER who looks

up in concern.

EXT. THE POOL - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT)                    378

This is the same pool where the Time Traveller

saved Weena's life.  The peaceful SOUND of the

RUSHING STREAM is occasionally interrupted by a

REMOTE RUMBLE of EXPLOSION from the earth below.

There is no sign in the sky of old constellations,

only the face of the full moon looks familiar.

The Time Traveller, wearing his velvet jacket,

relaxes on the white sand, playing with the

blossom Weena gave him earlier that day, and

WHISTLING "The Land Of The Leal".

Weena sits on a large rock nearby at the edge of

the pool, washing the soot from her face and hands.

She glances over to the Time Traveller.

He STOPS WHISTLING, but the MUSIC CONTINUES.

He turns.

Weena, relieved, starts to comb her wet hair

into a new arrangement.

The Time Traveller puts the flower back into his

pocket, gets up and walks over to Weena.

WEENA - MED. SHOT                                      379

The Time Traveller appears behind her.  He first

hesitates, then gently lifts her hair into a fair

imitation of the upswept Edwardian style.  She

smiles, then with an impulsive move turns her face

toward him.

The gesture brings her eyes and lips close to his.

He still holds her upswung hair and, as he gazes

into her young eyes, he feels her warm breath on

his cheek.

EXCITED VOICES o.s. interrupt this interlude.  They

both look in the direction of the voices.

EXT. HILL - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT) - (MATTE)              380

A group of Eloi, led by the Young Man and the Man

in White, approach them, talking excitedly,

pointing to the ruins of the white sphinx just

revealed by the rolling smoke.  The face is

broken and the pedestal partly in shambles.  The

panel is open.

TIME TRAVELLER & WEENA                                 381

Joyfully he grabs her hand and, pulling her,

breaks into a run.

GROUP OF ELOI                                          382

The Young Man steps forward, pointing o.s.  The

Time Traveller and Weena run through the haze,

then the Eloi follow them.

EXT. THE WHITE SPHINX - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT) -          383

(MATTE)

The face is broken in half.  It is left with only

a half a smile and thin smoke drifts through the

remaining eye.  The rest of the statue and the

sirens are on the ground beside the partial ruins

of the pedestal.  Beyond it the hill is gone and

gray haze covers the once green world.  The Time

Traveller and Weena come through the charred

bushes onto the lawn.  Here they stop.

THE OPEN PANEL - THEIR P.O.V.                          384

The Time Machine sits in the midst of the swirling

smoke.  The flames, licking at the inside walls,

have not yet reached the Machine.

TIME TRAVELLER & WEENA - MED. SHOT                     385

He releases her hand to reach into his jacket pocket

and bring forth the lever without which the Machine

will not function.

He walk, toward the panel.  Weena follow,

hesitantly, but the long habit compels her to

halt before the threshold.  Unmindful of this,

the Time Traveller enters.

INT. PEDESTAL - LONG SHOT                              386

Shooting from inside the pedestal, the Time

Traveller and his Machine are black silhouettes

in the foreground, while beyond him Weena stands

on the lawn outside, the moonlight flooding her

radiant features.

Inside, black smoke still rises and whirls around

as the Time Traveller examines his Machine and

starts to fit the lever into place.

REVERSE ANGLE                                          387

The Time Traveller working eagerly.  A shadow

starts sliding across his figure, moving more

swiftly until darkness falls and the panel closes

with a CLANG.

OUTSIDE THE PANELS                                     388

Weena, seeing the panels close, runs up to them

and POUNDS her fists vainly on the metal doors.

INSIDE THE SPHINX - MOVING SHOT                        389

The Time Traveller leaps to the panels and struggles

to open them.  From without he hears Weena's

POUNDING and CRIES.  Suddenly he senses a living

presence within the sphinx.  For a moment there is

silence.  Then from the right comes a hacking,

weak COUGH.  Another from the left.  Then some-

thing STUMBLES OFF, down the stairway.  He whirls

around, GASPING and COUGHING, to see three of the

enmaddened Morlocks rising before him.  Avoiding

them, he stumbles to his Machine and gets into

the saddle.  The suffocating smoke blinds him as

he gropes for the lever.  Morlocks seize his legs and

try to wrest him off the Machine.  The fire and

smoke become dense, half obliterating the struggling

bodies.

INSERT:  THE CONTROL PANNEL                            390

The Time Traveller's hand gropes for the lever and

finally grasps it.

OMITTED                                                391-403

INSERT OF DIALS                                        404

Spinning backwards.  Suddenly, a gloomy shade falls

over the instruments, followed by a burst of

whirling smoke and the twinkling red light of fire.

There is a flash of sunshine, then finally total

darkness.

TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             405

Passing back in time through his captivity beneath

the lava.  He reels in the saddle, then coming

from darkness a red glow quickly engulfs the scene.

As the red hot lava leaps away from him and the

daylight returns, we can see that his face is

covered with perspiration.  He looks off to see:

SERIES OF SHOTS - (ANIMATION, MINIATURE, SPLIT)        406

(NOTE:  These shots seen previously are now printed

BACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 407

INTERCUT his reaction to the previous scenes until

he straightens and readjusts the lever.  The

HUMMING DECREASES, then walls rise about him.

Watching the dials, he carefully moves the lever.

The flickers of the days and nights decelerate

and, with a sudden pull, he halts the Time Machine.

The HUMMING ABRUPTLY CEASES.

INSERT:  DIAL                                          408

It stops on:  "5 January 1900".

INT. LABORATORY - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT)                  409

The Time Machine has returned, but it is resting

in the far corner of the room instead of in the

spot where we originally saw it.

In the gloom, the Time Traveller clambers pain-

fully from the Machine.  Then, FOLLOWED BY CAMERA,

he staggers to the workbench and sinks onto it.

His eyes explore the room and finally come to rest

on the clock.  It is "8:04".

PENDULUM CLOCK - CLOSE SHOT                            410

Now showing "9:22".  For a long while only its

MONOTONOUS TICKING is heard. - A welcome change

from the cacophony of time traveling.

The CAMERA MOVES slowly to reveal the DINING ROOM

where the five men, their meal finished, are

sitting silently around the table.  Mrs. Watchett

is quietly serving the liqueur.  The Time Traveller

is puffing on his pipe.  Kemp is chewing on his

cigar and Hillyer's face is red with indignation.

Filby is bent over his coffee playing absorbedly

with the spoon which CLINKS loudly in the room's

silence.  Bridewell, of course, takes a big gulp

from his brandy.

He alone starts to laugh at his 'joke', but a

hiccup quickly puts a period to that.  Mrs. Watchett

steps to the Time Traveller to pour him a bit of

brandy.

As she exits Kemp looks up.

Bridewell examines the remaining brandy in his glass.

He places the blossoms on the table before Filby.

They are actually less than a day old and fairly

fresh.

FILBY AND THE BLOSSOMS - CLOSE SHOT                    411

As he picks them up to examine.

TIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             412

BACK TO FILBY                                          413

As he looks up, puzzled.

GROUP SHOT                                             414

A still unimpressed Hillyer slams his hands on

the table, stands up, looks around and then down

to Kemp.

Rising hesitantly, Kemp turns to the Time Traveller.

Everyone gets up, Bridewell with difficulty, and

starts to leave.

COTTAGE - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT) - (MATTE)                415

The snow falls softly, big flakes wobbling down

from the sky.  The front door opens letting out

the four guests wearing hats, capes and overcoats.

They walk toward a waiting carriage, Kemp helping

the staggering Bridewell.  Filby is the last to

leave.  He pauses at the step of the carriage

looking back to the Time Traveller who stands

motionless in the doorway.

AT THE ENTRANCE                                        416

The Time Traveller lifts his hand and waves.

With this he turns and goes into the house, closing

the door slowly.

AT THE CARRIAGE                                        417

Those inside are waiting for Filby to get in,

but he, deep in thought, still stands gazing back.

Kemp thrusts his head from the window.

Filby reaches a decision.

The WHIP CRACKS.

THE DRIVEWAY                                           418

As the carriage rolls off leaving Filby standing

in the falling snow.  He waits until the carriage

disappears, then retraces his steps to the front

door and raps on it.  He pauses a moment, then

uses the heavy knocker.  There is still no answer.

He steps back and looks off toward the:

EXT. LABORATORY WING - FILBY'S P.O.V.                  419

No light shines through its windows.

BACK TO FILBY                                          420

He raps once more, and getting no reply tries the

door.  It is unlocked.  He steps into the house.

INT. LIBRARY - FULL SHOT                               421

The coals still glow in the grate as Filby enters

the fully lit room, looking for his friend.

Suddenly a clock from the neighboring room CHIMES

ONCE.  Filby turns, goes toward it and stops at

the doorway.

DINING ROOM - FILBY'S P.O.V.                           422

The table is cleared, candles extinguished.  The

pendulum clock is TICKING lazily.  The time is

"9:30".

FILBY - PANSHOT                                        423

He calls into the darkness.

No answer.  Then an odd HUMMING sound brings

him to stiff attention.  The SOUND INCREASES in

VOLUME and PITCH until the entire house seems

to tremble.  Then a violent gust of wind blows

open the door that leads to the laboratory.

Filby pivots and runs up the steps, through the

corridor.

AT THE DOOR OF LABORATORY - FULL SHOT                  424

Filby, dishevelled and out of breath, arrives

and tries the door -- it is locked.  The NOISE

is almost DEAFENING.  He puts his shoulder to

the door and finally bursts it open.  At the

very instant he does so, the SOUND CEASES abruptly.

He stops short, gazing aghast.

THE LABORATORY - FILBY'S P.O.V.                        425

The Time Traveller with his Machine FADING,

leaving the present.

Then the CAMERA MOVES ACROSS the workbench to the

corner where we last saw the Time Machine.  It is

not there!  The CAMERA WHIPS to the other corner.

Nor is it there!  A few sheets of paper whirl

desolately in the center of the floor.

CLOSE ON FILBY                                         426

He looks tense, ignoring the APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS

behind him.  Mrs. Watchett hurries in.

The CAMERA FOLLOWS Mrs. Watchett as she slowly

approaches the center of the room.  Here, with

squinting eyes, she leans down to observe the

floor.

Filby steps aside her to investigate.

WHAT THEY SEE                                          427

The CAMERA MOVES ALONG parallel grooves resembling

the ones the Time Machine left in the lawn at the

front of the sphinx.  They are scratched deep in

the floor leading from the spot where the Machine

was last seen to the other corner of the laboratory

where it originally stood.  Here, not only its

imprint, but also the color and finish of the

floor is preserved.

TWO SHOT                                               428

They straighten.  Mrs. Watchett looks at Filby,

puzzled.

LABORATORY - FULL SHOT                                 429

Mrs. Watchett listens as Filby moves to the imprint

in the floor where the Machine first stood and

explains.

Filby doesn't answer.  He looks about the labora-

tory for the last time, then takes Mrs. Watchett's

arm and leads her from the room.  The MUSIC STARTS

THE THEME:  "The Land Of The Leal".

INT. LIBRARY - FULL SHOT                               430

Filby and Mrs. Watchett come into the room.

She looks around and discovers three empty spaces

on the tightly packed book shelves.  She walks to

them.

She looks at him, pondering the question as they

leave the library.

INT. ENTRANCE HALL                                     431

They stop at the door and Mrs. Watchett stands

beside Filby as he opens it.  Outside the snow

is falling softly.

With these words, Filby turns up his collar, pulls

the brim of his hat over his eyes and walks into

the night.  Mrs. Watchett looks after him.  She

hears the SOUND of his DIMINISHING FOOTSTEPS

SQUEAKING in the virgin snow.  Slowly she closes

the door.

EXT. COTTAGE - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT) - (MATTE)           432

Drifting like a curtain, the snow falls quietly

as Filby, a solitary figure in the night, pauses

a moment to look up at the sky, then selects a

path and starts walking the long way home.
