FADE IN:

EXT. IRAQI DESERT - DAY

WIDE ANGLE POV of wide open desert, flat grey sky.

THE CAMERA is running forward, toward a big sand berm in the

distance. There are O.S. sounds: SOLDIER'S EQUIPMENT

CLANKING, BOOTS RUNNING ON SAND. Hear a MAN's BREATHING.

The back of his helmeted head and his uniformed shoulders

APPEAR in the BOTTOM of the FRAME, running. This is TROY

BARLOW, Sargeant, U.S. Army, 25 years old. On his helmet is

a photo-button with a photo of a newborn baby.

Suddenly, on the sand berm 100 meters ahead, an IRAQI SOLDIER

stands. Troy stops in his tracks, out of breath, and stares

at the figure on the berm. The Iraqi flutters a white flag

over his head, then puts it down and picks up a gun. Troy

turns around, we see his face for the first time.

PAN TO THREE SOLDIERS 40 yards away -- ZOOM IN --

SOLDIER #1 unwraps a stick of gum and puts it into his mouth.

TWO OTHER SOLDIERS put out their hands and get pieces of gum.

PAN TO 100 yards away -- ZOOM IN -- SOLDIER #2 stands with

his head tilted back while SOLDIER #3 looks into his eye.

CAPTAIN VAN METER, 37, crab-like, is in the far distance.

PAN BACK TO Troy, faces the CAMERA, CLOSE, scared, then turns

back to the dune and runs a few yards.

Stops and stares, raises his rifle.  He aims at the figure on

the horizon.

POV THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE

The Iraqi soldier in the cross hairs. Hear Troy's breathing,

loud, as he pulls trigger slowly.  Slow motion RIFLE sound.

Silent pause. The Iraqi soldier stands there, then his neck

explodes like a sack of blood. Silent, except for sound of

Troy's LOUD BREATHING as he walks toward the big berm, and up

to the crest. All we hear are his footsteps and breathing.

YOUNG IRAQI SOLDIER

lies on the ground. A piece of his neck is blown away. He is

rasping, a flag is clasped in one hand; a rifle in the other.

He is looking up at Troy, who looks down at him.

FANTASY - INT. HOSPITAL, TORRANCE, CAL. - DAY

A WHITE BABY GIRL, covered in blood and placenta, is pulled

from between the legs of Troy's WIFE, DARLENE. THE NURSE

holds the SCREAMING BABY aloft, proud and happy.

EXT. IRAQI DESERT - DAY (PRESENT)

The rasping Iraqi dies.

PAN TO CONRAD VIG, 18 or 20, wiry, intense, deep south,

wearing Army issue glasses, out of breath.

Troy turns, upset, murmurs "I Get Around" by the Beach Boys.

FANTASY SEQUENCE IN SLOW MOTION

The Iraqi's head pops three feet into the air.

BACK TO THE SCENE

SCENE FROM 'PREDATOR'

Carl Weathers arm is shot off and keeps firing.

BACK TO THE SCENE.

He holds the camera out.

Soldiers get their cash out, Troy takes it.

SOLDIER #7 bends next to the corpse and holds his camera out

at arm's length.

Vig shoves the soldier away and the two wrestle as they roll

down the sand berm.

"I Just Want to Celebrate" by Rare Earth comes on LOUD.

Troy walks away holding his temple in pain; SOLDIERS gather

to stare at the dead Iraqi, getting their cameras out.

EXT. IRAQI DESERT ROAD - AMERICAN SOLDIERS IN COMBAT GEAR

dance on a road in the desert. "I Just Want to Celebrate"

BLARES as the CAMERA DOLLIES THROUGH the soldiers.

DOLLY INTO TENT TOWN, past bare chested soldiers pumping free

weights; jogging in formation; sunbathing on big water

storage mattresses; DOLLY OUT OF THE TENT TOWN, past a

soldier taking a makeshift foxhole desert bath, past a dead

Iraqi on the road, a chopper hovering in the distance, to

MORE DANCING SOLDIERS, as music continues --

DOLLY AROUND the dancing soldiers to see: hundreds of

stripped Iraqi soldiers lying face down in undershorts.

PAN PAST CNN REPORTER BILL SMITHSON, 45, in white safari

jacket over Desert Storm fatigues, cleaning his eye; nearby

a cluster of ROWDY SOLDIERS who are mugging into the camera.

DOLLY TO ARCHIE GATES, 55, Lieutenant Colonel, Special

Forces, wearing sunglasses, talking to HAVICHON, a FRENCH

Special Forces Captain on CRUTCHES with a broken leg.

Close up: portrait of a sheik on a Rolex.

SMASH TO: Rowdy soldiers mug for Smithson's camera.

Archie is walking off with CATHY DAITCH a young reporter.

Five soldiers chant Lee Greenwood's anthem, "Proud to Be An

American" into Smithson's camera --

WIDE, HIGH ANGLE DOLLYING CRANE OF BIG TENT CITY

Dissolve to POV from chopper - night - of twinkling lights of

vast U.S. Army camp below.

"Proud to Be An America" blasts. CHOPPER PILOTS sing off key.

INT. LARGE ARMY TENT - NIGHT

"Proud To Be An American" BLASTS on as

Troy, wearing a checked Arab headdress is paraded on

shoulders. He holds up a Coke can in one hand and a Bud can

in the other, like torches.

Soldiers scream and go nuts.

Beer is sputtered from soldiers' mouths.

"I Can't Do Nothing For Ya Man" by Public Enemy blasts.

WALTER WOGOMAN, 19, quiet, tall, Southern operates two

parallel boom boxes like a DJ.

A Soldier rapidly peels down one Bruce Lee poster on top of

another, like a flip-book animating Bruce Lee. Vig wearing

a bandage across his nose from the fight on the berm does a

series of cheerleader-like karate arm movements.

Soldiers whip brightly painted toy footballs at Troy. He

whips the balls back, is tackled over a table, crashes.

Soldiers -- Vig, Walter, others -- scream viscerally as the

music blasts.  Two soldiers fire their fingers like pistols

at Troy on the floor screaming like a fierce animal.

Vig screams into Troy's face at point blank range.

EXT. IRAQI DESERT - DAY

WIDE SHOT -  HUNDREDS OF IRAQIS walking in the desert, hands

raised above their heads.

TWO IRAQIS with bad face wounds get medical help.

FIVE IRAQIS

on their knees, plead for mercy in Arabic as they disrobe.

They grab and kiss Troy Barlow's hand, as he holds his M-16

on the begging Iraqis.

Vig whips out his big Thunder 5 pistol and points it in their

faces.

The Iraqis wail for mercy. Troy pushes Vig's pistol away.

Vig points the big pistol at an OLDER IRAQI OFFICER who is

the only one not taking his clothes off.

The Officer does not move, Troy punches his head once. Vig

and Walter forcibly pull the Iraqi Officer's pants off. Troy

takes out a bottle of aspirin, eats two.

Vig points to the Officer's bare buttocks, where a rolled up

piece of paper is sticking out --

Troy pulls out a latex glove out of his pocket.

The Officer screams in protest and is forcibly subdued by

Walter as Vig, wearing the glove, slowly pulls the rolled up,

greasy paper from the Officer's ass -- Troy looks disgusted.

Vig takes out a U.S. Army pen and uses it to unroll the

greasy paper and lie it flat on the sand.

CLOSE UP - THE RUMPLED PAPER

is a handwritten map, with scant Arabic writing, a few spare

roads, numbers, and three small boxes.

INT. TELEVISION TRUCK - DAY

In the half-light of dozens of TV monitors playing Iraqi news

from around the world, Archie Gates madly humps CATHY DAITCH

on a lawn chair which is slamming into the monitors.

TV monitors crash to the floor as she climaxes. Archie lays

on the floor catching his breath, stares at a sideways

monitor of soldiers celebrating; she stands, dresses.

The door explodes open and two MPs grab Archie, pants around

his ankles, and drag him from the truck.

EXT. TELEVISION TRUCK - DAY

Archie is faced by an OLDER TWO STAR GENERAL (GENERAL PYE),

a YOUNGER ONE STAR GENERAL (GENERAL HORN).

WHIP PAN TO Cathy runs away as she dresses, MPs grab her.

They let her go. Soldiers in gas suits laugh.

Bill Smithson runs up, agitated.

The MP pushes Smithson away.

Smithson is walked away. Archie pulls his pants up.

Archie suddenly reaches out and grabs the corner of General

Horn's collar, with its one star.

Archie leans wild-eyed into Horn's face and whispers --

INT. CAPTAIN'S TENT - DAY

SPLASH -- rubbing alcohol is poured over Vig's extended hand

by DOC ELGIN, 25, stocky, black, no nonsense.

Doc Elgin opens a case full of pill bottles.

Troy pops the pills, Doc pulls a document from a folder and

opens it as he hovers over a table with Troy and Vig.

Walter stands by the door wearing night vision goggles.

Doc unfolds a big aerial-photo map of the Iraqi desert, next

to the rumpled ass map.

POV WALTER'S NIGHT VISION --

BLURRY IMAGE OF ARCHIE WALKING right up to Walter.

Troy and Doc scramble to put the maps under the table.

He walks up to them.

Archie fixes his gaze on Troy, walks up, reaches under the

table, and takes the map, smells his fingers.

Troy and Vig are impressed.

He points in order to Doc, Vig, and Troy, who picks up his

family photo button.

Walter, outside the tent, practices blocking positions.

Troy stands and grabs the map.

Both Troy and Archie hold the map, staring at each other.

Everyone is tense.

Troy lets go. Archie holds the map up to the light. He then

pours some of Doc's rubbing alcohol on the map, and holds it

to the light again. He puts the map on the table, turns the

light off and clicks on an infra-red flashlight he pulls out.

A completely different map appears in green markings.

They stare at the new map in the infrared glow, captivated.

He turns the overhead light back on.

They look at him.

Dolly: Troy, Doc, Vig stare at Archie.

FANTASY - EXT. LOS ANGELES - DAY

SILENT - Troy walks in white shirtsleeves, dark tie, pulling

a cart with a salesman's black case on it over a curb.

FANTASY - INT. OFFICE

SILENT - Troy kneels at a disassembled photocopier, tools and

parts all around him, opens a bag of toner, which spills

black dust all over his white shirt

FANTASY - INT. KENNEDY AIRPORT

SILENT - Doc is a red cap. He lifts suitcases from the trunk

of a black Mercedes while a rich white father (mother and two

small children behind) tells him to be careful.

FANTASY - EXT. MISSISSIPPI WOODS

Vig fires his pistols with fury at a series of stuffed

animals on logs -- blowing the stuffed animals to

smithereens.

He looks at them.

They salute him. He straightens Troy's salute.

Walter comes in.

Vig smile fades as he looks into Archie's cold stare.

EXT. DESERT CAMP - WIDE SHOT - DAWN

Three figures in fatigues crouch low to the ground as they

run to a motorcycle and side car. Walter kickstarts the

motorcycle. PACO the cameraman sits behind Walter with a

video camera. Walter's face is painted beige and brown with

camouflage spots, so is Bill Smithson's, as he crouches in

the sidecar and dramatically gives Walter the thumb's up.

EXT. VAN METER'S TENT - DAY

Cathy Daitch stands next to a cameraman filming Van Meter

while another man holds a boom over Van Meter's head.

Van Meter tries a couple of poses.

EXT. DESERT - MOVING HUMVEE - MORNING

Pow pow pow, Vig fires his big pistol into the desert.

Troy throws a painted football into the desert. Doc fires the

M-16 and blows the ball to pieces.

The convertible Humvee is loaded with weaponry and gear, a

mounted 60 mm machine gun, a Bart Simpson doll on the grill.

The Humvee rolls into the vast desert, littered with burned

out tanks, black craters, overturned vehicles, no people.

Troy throws another ball, Doc blows it away.

Doc throws a football from the moving Humvee, Troy fires a

pistol and misses the ball as it bounces to the desert.

Archie moves his hand to the Bach.

Doc throws a ball. Vig fires his giant pistol twice and

misses.

Vig fires: blam, blam, bam. The Humvee stops abruptly.

They sit in embarrassed silence; the joyous Bach choir plays.

EXT. DESERT DAY

No more music. Troy, Doc, and Vig stand spread apart. They

wear white anti-gas suits and hold pistols and drink from

plastic water bottles. A bomb crater is nearby, a wrecked,

burned truck to the side, a SKINNY COW meanders.

Troy kicks at something in the sand -- and a decayed human

arm springs out, attached to a body with a half-rotted face.

FANTASY - A HUGE PLOW

on the front of a Bradley pushes sand right TOWARD THE CAMERA

DOLLY INTO five terrified Iraqis, eyes open with fear, as the

sand rolls over them.

BACK TO THE SCENE

EXT. DESERT - LATER

They sit in the Humvee and hold their pistols ready.

The cow stares as the Humvee pulls up to it fast. Troy and

Doc jump out, pistols drawn, flank the cow --

The cow steps back, and explodes.

Troy and Doc stand splattered with cow entrails. The cow's

head lands with a

He picks cow entrails off himself.

Archie watches Troy.

Archie takes Vig's BIG PISTOL and EMPTIES THE SHELLS and puts

them into his pocket.

FANTASY - INT. STOMACH MUSCLE AND TISSUE

Slow motion, a bullet pierces flesh, makes a cavity --

Bile fluid fills the cavity.

BACK TO THE SCENE

They look at Archie, scared by this.

EXT. DESERT - DAY - HIGH WIDE SHOT

'I Get Around' by The Beach Boys BLASTS as the Humvee speeds

along. A big American flag flaps in the breeze from a pole at

the back of the Hummer.

The Humvee drives fast into the central square of a small

village of low, sand-colored stucco buildings and shanties.

Vig drives as the Humvee speeds around the town square,

zooming past scared Shiites in black robes, a few skinny

dogs, a few bewildered Iraqi soldiers.

He studies the map and points to a decayed green building.

Vig jerks the wheel right.  They drive fast.

Archie points left. Vig jerks the wheel left, drives straight

toward a low cement building with two Iraqi soldiers in front.

Iraqi soldiers look scared as the Humvee drives up, like it's

going to hit them, and stops, flag fluttering in the breeze.

Vig stands and speaks into a megaphone.

Troy and Doc leap from the Humvee with pistols drawn and

their free hands held up in a 'halt' sign. The TWO IRAQI

GUARDS look stunned as Troy and Doc simply take their machine

guns and put the Iraqis face down on the ground. Troy and Doc

pull out

Archie bounds forward holding up a thick white document.

Troy finishes handcuffing one of the Iraqi soldiers, as a

gaunt mother, with a baby in her arms, opens her blouse,

revealing her small breasts. Other peasants gather.

Troy looks shocked until Archie suddenly pushes him past the

Iraqi mother and to the door of the bunker, which Doc holds.

INT. BUNKER - DAY

Five IRAQI SOLDIERS look disoriented and scared as they hold

their hands up in the air.

EXT. BUNKER - DAY

Iraqi women and children kiss Vig's feet.

The five Iraqi soldiers exit the bunker with their hands

raised, and the starved Shiite civilians spit and throw

stones at them while 'I Get Around' keeps playing.

INT. STAIRWELL - BUNKER

Archie runs down the narrow stairs of the bunker, followed by

Troy and Doc.

INT. BASEMENT OF BUNKER - DAY

Doc lashes an Iraqi's hands behind his back and cuffs him.

Troy shoots the door lock with his pistol.  Then backs up and

gives it a running shoulder. The door doesn't budge.

He holds his shoulder in pain.  Archie kicks the door

repeatedly.  Troy joins him, it finally flies open.

Troy is embraced by an Iraqi soldier, about 25.

Troy tries some karate moves, jerking his elbows to dislodge

the Iraqi from the bear hug --

Doc points his pistol in the Iraqi's face.

The Iraqi throws his hands in the air.

Archie goes to a series of WOODEN CRATES the size of file

cabinets, where Doc helps Archie take off his back pack.

Archie pulls out a bolt cutter and a pneumatic saw, both

attached to a small air tank - and opens the crate, which is

filled with hundreds of Kuwaiti passports.

They use the power tools to open the second crate -- also

filled with hundreds of passports.

Archie pulls out the infrared map and shows it to the Iraqi,

who says nothing.

They point their guns. It's a show. Archie holds the map.

EXT. BUNKER - DAY

FOUR NEW IRAQI SOLDIERS, armed with rifles, run from the far

side of the square and start shooting.

30 rock-throwing Shiite scatter at the gunfire. TWO MEN fall

to the ground as they are shot.

Vig looks terrified as the crowd scatters, leaving him alone

as he points his big unloaded pistol. The soldiers point

their rifles as they come towards Vig, when suddenly two of

them look to the side and shout.

PAN TO a shiny METAL TANKER TRUCK three hundred yards out,

bearing down fast on the village square.

The soldiers open fire on the truck.

INT - THE CAB OF THE TANKER TRUCK

The Shiite riding shotgun fires back, as the windshield

shatters on the truck. The driver is dead. The other Shiite

grabs the wheel.

BACK TO THE SCENE

Archie bursts out the front door, followed by Troy and Doc.

They freeze as --

The tanker truck careens sideways toward them, 50 feet away.

An Iraqi soldier fires a grenade-launcher off his shoulder

which explodes the container on the back of the truck --

Milk explodes everywhere, gushing around the wheels of the

Humvee and the feet of Archie and the others.

Shiite women with plastic containers and ceramic jugs rush

out from alleys and try to scoop up the milk. Other Shiites

crowd the Humvee and climb in.

Iraqi soldiers drag two bodies from the cab of the truck.

Troy and Doc point their guns in the crowd.

Archie shoves Shiite peasants out of the Humvee.

She holds a SHIRTLESS BOY of 7 with a bandage around his

entire chest. Doc pushes her off the Humvee.

He grabs Archie. Troy shoves the man off the vehicle. Vig

starts the engine.

Troy rips open a large duffel and starts handing out Army

Meal Rations to the crowd -- Vig leans on the horn.

The friendly Iraqi jumps into the rear of the Hummer as it

starts to pull away. Archie shoves the friendly Iraqi out,

and he lands on his ass in the swarm of chasing Shiites.

Archie and Troy look back at the debacle as they pull away.

EXT. DESERT MARSH - DAY

Raging oil fires, 50 feet high -- billowing black smoke.

Walter drives the motorcycle through the smoke. Paco the

Cameraman sits on back. Bill Smithson sits in the sidecar.

Walter keeps driving.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

Doc gets out of the stopped Humvee, shaken, and walks around.

He lies down and breathes heavily with a hand on his chest.

He angrily takes off his gas suit; boxers and sweat-drenched

green T-shirt underneath.  Troy and Vig guzzle water.

The others, all drenched in sweat, take off their gas suits.

FANTASY - STOCK FOOTAGE: UNION SOLDIERS FIGHT DIXIE REBELS

BACK TO THE SCENE

Vig looks puzzled.

Archie chucks each of them MARINE UNIFORMS without name tags

which everyone puts on, except Troy.

He pulls a vest out of the Humvee.

EXT. MARSH

The motorcycle is stopped by the marsh. Siberian pelicans fly

all around. Many lie dead on the ground.  Bill Smithson paces

with a cell phone.

Bill Smithson closes the cell phone.

Smithson mounts the bike. The cameraman sits on back.

Smithson starts the bike.

The bike pulls out, leaving him behind. He runs after the

bike and jumps into the side car.

EXT. COMPANY B CAMP - DAY

Captain Van Meter strolls, handling an M-16.

Van Meter pulls out a folded paper and gives it to the

general, who looks at it.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

Bach's 'Gloria' plays loud as Vig drives and Archie stares

straight ahead as the Humvee picks up speed.

EXT. ANOTHER VILLAGE OUTSIDE KARBALA - DAY

The Hummer zips into a bigger village piazza with an old

fortress at one end, and races straight to the entrance to an

underground bunker in the middle of the piazza.

Troy and Doc leap out, hold pistols out at arm's length as

they accost TWO IRAQI SOLDIERS pointing rifles at them.

Troy and Doc shove the two Iraqis face down in the dirt and

cuff their hands behind their backs.

INT. SECOND IRAQI BUNKER - DAY

Archie runs down a narrow cement corridor, pistol held at

arm's length, white document in the other hand; followed by

Troy and Doc, pistols drawn.

An IRAQI SOLDIER steps into the corridor at the far end, sees

Archie coming, looks terrified, and runs back. Archie and

Troy run right past the scared Iraqi. Doc comes third,

slamming the Iraqi face down and cuffing him.

Archie kicks a door open and goes in, followed by Troy.

INT. INNER ROOM, SECOND IRAQI BUNKER - DAY

Archie and Troy burst in, pointing their guns aggressively.

A large room; walls lined with shelves full of brand new

appliances: blenders, cuisinarts, CD players, small TVs. A

huge portrait of Saddam Hussein covers one wall.

A television plays a rerun of 'Happy Days' in Arabic.

Another TV: CNN's first reports of the Rodney King beating.

An IRAQI CAPTAIN sits in a chair in front of the TVs.

TWO IRAQIS sit loading rifles. Two others sit at a radio.

They all jump to their feet when Archie bursts in, except for

the officer watching 'Happy Days' and CNN..

One of the rifle-loading Iraqis tries to run. Troy heads him

off with his pistol --

The other rifle-loader stands looking scared.

WHIP PAN TO Doc, who turns the shortwave radio off, pushes

the TWO IRAQIS to the ground. One goes peacefully, the other

resists; Doc smacks him in the side of the head with his

pistol, which fires accidentally. Everyone grabs their heads

and ducks -- except Archie.

Archie is offered a cuisinart by the Iraqi Captain.

Troy has one rifle Iraqi on the ground, but the second is on

his knees, putting a CD into a mini-stereo.

The Iraqi looks puzzled.

He pushes the man face down, cuffs his hands. Olivia Newton-

John's "I Wanna Get Physical" PLAYS.

WHIP PAN TO the resistant Iraqi struggles to break away and

Doc punches him in the head twice, the Iraqi starts crying.

PAN TO Troy pointing to a narrow door in a corner of the

room. Archie kicks it open.

INT. INNER ROOM - DAY

A bound, naked SHIITE MAN IN GLASSES, clean shaven, sits on

the floor in a five foot square shallow metal box, four

inches deep, filled with water. There is an electric cable

going into the water. The naked Shiite in glasses shakes.

Troy watches Archie walk over and yank the cable out.

Archie pauses, then gives the Sargeant a backhand that sends

him flying to the corner. Archie steps on the man's wrist,

takes the pistol out of his hand. Troy watches.

Archie turns and sees TEN SHIITES across the room: 3 MEN, 3

WOMEN, 4 CHILDREN. The men and women are bound and GAGGED.

Archie steps toward the Shiites, but the INTERROGATOR, 35,

also a captain, steps in his way.

Archie stares at the INTERROGATOR with contempt.

The disarmed Iraqi Sargeant NODS and opens a small rear door

and pushes the Shiites out. Archie walks back to the main

room and points his pistol in the Captain's face.

EXT. FRONT OF BUNKER TWO - DAY

Vig keeps the TWO CUFFED IRAQI GUARDS on the ground at gun

point as 15 SHIITES with crude clubs and sling shots encircle.

One of the Shiites shoots a rock from the slingshot and nails

a handcuffed Iraqi in the back of the head.

The Shiites back away as Vig motions with his big pistol.

PAN TO the ten Shiites, and the naked Man with Glasses, who

is getting dressed, exiting the side of the bunker, ushered

by the unarmed Iraqi Sargeant.

Suddenly a SHIITE WOMAN runs up to the tortured Shiite Man

with Glasses and embraces him, sobbing. A LITTLE GIRL with

dirty casts on both broken arms runs up and hugs his legs.

The bound Shiite prisoners start to walk away from the

bunker, and the unarmed Sargeant has a fit.

He chases the prisoners, pushes them back. The free Shiites

shoot rocks and club him.

INT. BUNKER NUMBER TWO - DAY

Archie runs down several narrow sets of cement stairs,

followed by the Interrogator, the other Iraqi Captain, Troy,

and Doc. (SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH)

EXT. BUNKER - DAY

The Shiite crowd curses and spits on the Iraqi soldiers. The

Sargeant is beaten.

Suddenly an Iraqi armored truck with a mounted machine gun

races up and SEVEN IRAQI SOLDIERS pour out swinging clubs,

followed by an IRAQI MAJOR, about 45. The Iraqi soldiers

savagely beat the Shiites.

Vig looks horrified as he watches.

TWO SOLDIERS grab the Woman from the Man With Glasses, and

drag her into a circle with three other soldiers; the ten

year-old girl with dirty casts on both arms, screams and

punches at them.

The Man With Glasses is held down at knife point.

The Iraqi Major glances over at Vig, but the soldiers do not

stop brutalizing the Shiites -- they round up eight more

Shiites and make them lay face down.

INT. BASEMENT

Troy and Doc disarm TWO GUARDS outside a door in the basement.

Archie goes through the door, followed by the Iraqi

Interrogator and Captain.

INT. ROOM OF BUNKER 2 - DAY

Bright white cement, many overhead lights and a high ceiling.

Archie stands looking at the suitcases with Troy and Doc.

Several of the big Vuitton suitcases are laid on their sides

by Archie, Troy and Doc.

The Iraqi Captain paces frantically punching and kicking the

walls and talking (SUBTITLED in ENGLISH).

The suitcases are quickly unzipped. One suitcase is full of

gleaming antique silverware. One suitcase is full of jewelry.

Archie opens one full of hundreds of gold Cartier watches.

Troy and Doc slip a handful of jewelry into their pockets.

The Iraqi Captain goes nuts, throwing himself on Doc's back,

choking Doc, who flails about. Troy punches the Iraqi in the

head and rips him off Doc.

Archie puts his pistol in the man's face.

He turns to Doc.

Doc and Troy, out of breath, empty their pockets of jewelry.

Archie opens another Vuitton suitcase and pushes it aside -

it's full of Kuwaiti passports.

When Doc opens the next suitcase, he freezes. Archie looks

over and freezes. Troy closes cuffs behind the Captain's back

and looks over his shoulder -- wide-eyed.

The very large Vuitton suitcase is filled with five-kilo

bricks of gold. They all stare. Troy picks one up.

Archie holds another brick.

Archie opens another large Vuitton suitcase, and it is also

filled with sixty bars. Troy opens another suitcase, there's

another sixty bars. Doc opens another, another sixty bars.

They frantically check all of the suitcases. The handcuffed

Captain is crying.

Archie, Doc and Troy look at each other in shock.

With effort, Doc and Troy help Archie pick up the heavy,

jumbo-sized suitcase sideways, like a table top.

Suddenly the suitcase rips apart and gold bars fall to the

floor; one lands on Troy's foot. He jumps in pain.

Archie, Troy, and Doc hoist another suitcase sideways and the

bricks rip through and fall to the floor --

The Interrogator looks at him.

INT. BUNKER BASEMENT - LATER

120 small, round, Vuitton overnight bags, laid out and

opened, cover the entire floor of the basement.

Troy and Doc finish putting 5 bars in each bag. Archie paces,

sweating, speedy like he's on cocaine.

Troy and Doc look nervous.

BACK TO THE SCENE

INT. NARROW CEMENT STAIRCASE OF BUNKER

Troy runs up the stairs.

EXT. BUNKER - DAY

Troy runs out the front door.

The Iraqi Major stares coldly at Troy. Troy stares at the two

soldiers beating Shiites; five others clustered around the

woman on the ground.

LATER

Troy and Vig untangle, with difficulty, an ox cart from a

messy pile of old ox carts against a bombed out building.

Troy looks troubled --

CLOSE UP A SHIITE MAN is smashed in the face with a club.

CLOSE UP TROY pulls a heavy chain from the Humvee.

The Little Girl with arm casts is screaming while her father,

the Man In Glasses, tries to hold her.

Troy and Vig quickly chain the ox cart to the Humvee.

INT. NARROW CEMENT STAIRCASE OF BUNKER

Archie, Doc, the Interrogator run up carrying Vuitton cases.

INT. UPSTAIRS ROOM OF BUNKER - DAY

They hurry past the huge poster of Saddam, the TVs playing

'Happy Days' and Rodney King, the many shelves of stereos,

etc., and past the soldiers lying face down, handcuffed.

EXT. BUNKER NUMBER TWO - DAY

Archie, Doc, and the Interrogator charge out of the bunker

with Vuitton luggage and put it onto the ox cart Troy has

rigged. Archie and Doc stop and stare in shock --

Soldiers 6 & 7 drag and beat Shiites; 5 wounded men and women

lie on the ground bleeding. A cuffed Iraqi Guard kneels with

a bleeding head. Five soldiers continue to encircle someone

(the Shiite woman). The Man In Glasses and the Little Girl

PRAY in ARABIC as they bow on the ground.

Troy and Vig stare back at Archie, looking tense.

Shiites run past throwing rocks at Iraqi soldiers 6 & 7 who

tackle and pummel them to the ground.

The Major turns and shouts --

Iraqis 6 & 7 jog over. The soldiers are out of breath.

Archie looks at one soldier's hands.

CLOSE UP: BLOOD on the Iraqi Soldier's knuckles and wrists.

PAN UP TO THE FACES of the Iraqi soldiers.

INT. STAIRWELL

Iraqi Soldiers 6 & 7 carry suitcases up the narrow stairs.

EXT. BUNKER NUMBER TWO - DAY

Luggage is loaded into the Humvee and the cart while Troy

directs Iraqis 6 & 7; Doc and Vig help.

The cart collapses from the weight into a pile of broken wood.

The Vuitton bags roll onto the debris-cluttered ground, one

goes through a pool of blood. Doc picks the case up.

Archie looks vaguely disgusted.

Troy backs the truck up.

Vuitton hat cases are loaded into the back of the truck,

which is completely full.

Archie sits behind the wheel of the Humvee. Vig sits next to

him. Archie starts the engine. Iraqi 6 taps on the door of

the Humvee by way of saying goodbye. Archie nods.

The Iraqi Major points to the Shiite Woman.

Troy jerks slightly in his seat and turns away. Doc stares.

Archie bows his head to the steering wheel and leans there

for a second as Vig looks wide-eyed at the dead woman.

The Girl in arm casts screams. She is grabbed by the hair and

pulled away by an Iraqi soldier, but the Man In Glasses

punches him and takes the girl. The soldier chases them with

a knife and jabs at the man, cutting him, but not lethally.

The Iraqis look at him. The soldier with the knife continues

to slash the Man In Glasses.

He salutes Archie.

The Iraqi Major smiles. The Interrogator laughs.

The Iraqi Major continues smiling.

Troy and Doc stare at Archie, then Troy gets out of the

truck, Doc gets out of the Humvee,

forward with a rifle; Doc points at Iraqi 7, who has also

come forward. To the rear, Iraqi 6 stands with a rifle, near

Iraqis 2,3,4 and the Sargeant stand over the eight

prone Shiite prisoners laying face down.

Vig nervously sits for a moment, then jumps to his feet and

mans the mounted machine gun in the rear of the Hummer.

Troy, Doc, Vig watch with trepidation as Archie walks toward

the soldier slashing the Man In Glasses, who carries the Girl.

Archie reaches over and grabs the slasher's wrist, pulling

the blade away from the man's body. He holds the soldier's

wrist up. The soldier grabs for Archie's throat with his free

hand, but Archie grabs this hand and twists it away, putting

the Iraqi into a choke hold. The soldier drops the knife in

the dirt.

The bloodied Man In Glasses collapses to the ground,

clutching the Little Girl in arm casts.

Troy, Doc, Vig point their guns. The Iraqi Major is pissed.

Archie sweeps the soldier's feet out, pins the soldier face

down on the ground, and throws the soldier's gun away. Archie

helps the Shiite Man In Glasses to his feet, takes the Girl,

and walks them over to the Humvee.

Two Shiite prisoners try to stand up, the Iraqi guards kick

them back down.

The Iraqi Major raises his machine gun as he stands next to

the Humvee, but Archie grabs the barrel and holds it down.

Troy looks scared as he points his pistol at the Iraqi

soldiers, who point their rifles back at Troy and Doc.

CUT BACK TO the Major pauses, then smashes the barrel of his

machine gun, with Archie's hand, against the Humvee.

Archie winces, but doesn't let go. The Major does it again,

smashing Archie's hand. Archie winces, doesn't let go. The

Major tries to jerk the barrel up, but Archie pushes it down,

and it fires by accident, into the Major's leg. The Major

howls with pain. Blood dribbles out the bottom of his pants

leg like piss.

Troy covers Iraqi 6 with his rifle.

Vig nervously swings the mounted machine gun from one Iraqi

in the rear to another, but doesn't shoot. Iraqi soldiers

point their rifles at the Americans.

ANGLE ON TROY

WHIP PAN TO Iraqi 6 jerks his rifle toward Archie and fires.

The sound cuts out.

SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION: WHIP PAN from Iraqi rifle to Archie.

The only SOUND is the BULLET PIERCING THE FLESH of Archie's

lower left arm and tearing his muscle as it passes through.

Archie grimaces violently in pain.

SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION: Troy fires his pistol. NO SOUND except

for the SLOW MOTION SOUND of the BULLET EXPLODING.

SLOW MOTION: The bullet tears through Iraqi 6's chest.

THE ONLY SOUND is the IRAQI'S HEARTBEAT, the bullet tearing

flesh and crushing bone, and the heartbeat stopping with a

VIOLENT SPLASH. Iraqi 6 falls to the ground with only a dull

thud and the slow clank of his gear.

REGULAR SPEED: Vig swings the mounted machine gun from one

Iraqi to another, but still doesn't shoot. He looks terrified

as his thumbs twitch on the triggers.

Iraqi 7 FIRES twice.

SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION: a bullet tears into Troy's chest with

a DULL SNAP. He winces in pain.

PAN TO the windshield of the Humvee shatters behind Doc; he

turns and fires his pistol.

PAN TO -- slightly slow motion: NO SOUND EXCEPT THE BULLET

TEARING INTO IRAQI 7'S KNEE, smashing through bone. He falls

to the ground clutching his leg.

SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION: Vig swings the mounted machine gun and

FIRES. NO SOUND BUT THE SLOW CRACKS OF THE RED TRACER BULLETS

EXPLODING from the gun.

SLOW MOTION: tracer bullets slice across the face of Iraqi 5

and Iraqi 2 in the rear, NO SOUND BUT THE BULLETS BREAKING

THROUGH BONE AND FLESH.

SLOW MOTION: Archie jams his pistol under the Major's chin

and FIRES -- the ONLY SOUND IS THE. SLOW EXPLOSION OF THE GUN,

and the slow tearing of tissue, ending with a sharp SNAP as

the tissue, bone, and the bullet CRACK out the top of the

Iraqi Major's head.

HIGH ANGLE LOOKING DOWN -- replay of entire shoot out at

REGULAR SPEED. Ending on the wide-eyed Little Girl with her

hand in her mouth, staring.

ANOTHER ANGLE -- replay of entire shoot out at REGULAR SPEED.

Ending on Troy wincing as he holds his chest.

Archie's lightly blood-flecked face stares down at the dead

Major, clouds pass overhead.

Dead Iraqi 6 lies with legs twisted under his body.

A rivulet of blood trickles through the sand. A spider runs

across it and gets stuck.

LOW ANGLE up at Doc, stone still, staring straight ahead as

clouds pass slowly above him in the sky.

Vig nervously swings the mounted machine gun back and forth.

Troy, drenched in sweat, looks pained as he unbuttons his

shirt: there's a gunshot in his kevlar vest. The slug drops

out of the dent, into his hand -- he exhales.

Iraqis 2, 3, 4, and the Sargeant, throw their hands up in

surrender and drop their weapons.  Big Iraqi 2 walks toward

the Humvee in surrender, and bows down.

Archie points.

Vig swings the mounted machine gun toward the three remaining

Iraqi soldiers who stand over eight terrified Shiites.

Doc follows Archie over to the three Iraqi soldiers.

The soldiers get on their knees, pleading for mercy.

Doc takes the Iraqi soldiers' guns and pushes them down.

Shiites and Iraqi soldiers watch the debate nervously.

Doc points to the Shiites.

Troy displays the gunshot in the Kevlar.

Suddenly, THE SOUND of an APPROACHING TANK. They turn.

A tank rolls toward them fast, down a narrow side street,

followed by a truck with a rocket launcher.

Vig struggles to lift the grenade launcher.

Troy jumps into the luggage-packed truck, starts the engine.

Vig starts the Humvee; Archie jumps in next to Vig.

PAN TO the eight Shiites, plus the Man In Glasses and the

Little Girl, jam into the crowded Humvee. Doc jumps in.

The tank approaches. The Humvee pulls away. The tank rolls in

from the side, but the tank turret WHINES and CLICKS, stuck

in place. An Iraqi pops out the top of the tank.

He gestures to the whining, stuck, turret. Another Iraqi

tries pushing the turret. The truck with the small rocket

launcher pulls up.

disinfectant over Archie's gunshot wound in his lower left

arm, and wraps it. Vig looks terrified as he drives.

SLOW MOTION: a rocket streaks a squiggly white line of smoke

across the sky.

REAR OF HUMVEE, SLOW MOTION: half the Shiites hunch down,

bracing for an explosion while the other half crane their

necks, looking straight up into the sky. They cower when

there is an EXPLOSION above.

PAN UP TO - REGULAR SPEED: the ROCKET EXPLODES in the sky a

hundred yards above the Humvee -- INTO A BROWN CLOUD.

Troy leans out the window of the moving truck and squints up

at the brown gas cloud above as he drives fast.

Archie and Doc grapple to put on their gas masks. Vig reaches

around behind him for his mask as he drives.

He accidentally veers off the road into the open desert.

ZOOM IN TO a field of mines sitting right on top of the sand,

20 yards ahead. [Iraqi mines were often placed this way]

ZOOM IN ON Archie's alarmed face

Archie dives from the Humvee followed by Vig, Doc, the Man In

Glasses holding the Little Girl, the other Shiites, including

the Two Five Year Olds. The Hummer drives ten yards, hits the

first mine with an explosion and flies into the air --

INT. TRUCK DRIVEN BY TROY

Flying debris smashes the windshield. Troy instinctively

jerks the wheel and the truck flips onto its side and slides

across the sand.

EXT. MINEFIELD

The airborne Humvee lands on its side, hits another mine, is

blown into the air, lands on its back, and is blown to pieces.

Troy sits sideways as the truck slides across the sand to a

halt inches before a mine, 30 yards behind the wrecked Humvee.

SILENCE. A wheel on the wrecked Humvee spin in the air,

squeaking.

Louis Vuitton suitcases are scattered all over. One has

opened and the gold bars are spilled around.

Shiites stagger to their feet, some cut and bleeding, some

limping. They cover their faces with their clothes as the

dense brown fog descends around them.

Doc picks up Vig's glasses and hands them to Vig, who stands,

blinking his one good eye, while blood streams down his face.

Vig is in shock. Doc lifts Vig's bloody hand to Vig's mouth.

Unseen in the fog, Troy climbs out of the overturned truck.

He picks up two Vuitton hat cases, looks up, sees the TWO

LITTLE CHILDREN from the Humvee, running across a mine field

SCREAMING.

Troy stands watching as the children run farther away, crying.

He runs, hard, after the children, who are now 70 yards away,

the Vuitton hat cases banging against his legs.

Doc pulls a syringe from a sterile packet, is about to stick

it into his leg when Archie grabs his hand.

EXT. DESERT - MINEFIELD

Troy chases the children through the brown fog, he drops one

of the suitcases, catches up to the Girl and scoops her up in

his left arm and covers her face with her coat.

TROY'S POV

as he runs between land mines after the Boy, who is way ahead.

BACK TO THE SCENE

Troy drops the other Vuitton bag, catches the Boy and has

both children under his arms like footballs -- when suddenly

Troy is grabbed from behind with a cord around his neck -- he

lands on his back with the two children in his arms.

TROY'S POV LOOKING UP

the Iraqi Interrogator, wearing a gas mask, kicks Troy in the

head. The screaming Children are torn from Troy's arms by

Iraqi soldiers. Troy reaches for his pistol and it is ripped

from his hand as he is dragged to an Iraqi jeep.

EXT. DESERT - NEAR ARCHIE AND DOC

Archie and Doc circle through the thick haze carrying a

Vuitton hat case and cover their mouths and noses.

About five Shiites wander around, confused.

Archie spins around, drops the bag and points his pistol.

TWO BLACK ROBED FIGURES pick up Vuitton hat cases.

A Black Robed Figure walks right past Archie, takes a scared

Shiite man by the arm and leads him to the side.

More black cloaked figures appear. There are THIRTY IN ALL.

Archie, Doc, and Vig look disoriented, point their pistols

around as black robes appear and lead the Shiites away.

The robes lead the Shiites to a 4 FOOT HIGH TUNNEL ENTRANCE

in a mound of desert earth and disappear into it.

Vig stands and rubs his one good eye. Doc grabs Vig by the

arm and pulls him back toward the tunnel.

Vig jerks his arm away.

Doc grabs Vig.

Vig punches Doc in the side of the head. Doc punches Vig in

the stomach. They fall to the ground, fighting.

Archie searches for Troy in the brown haze.

Two black-robed figures pull Vig off Doc and drag him to the

tunnel. Another robed figure pulls Doc to the tunnel.

Archie walks, looks for Troy, chokes, vomits into the sand.

A black robed figure takes him by the arm and pulls him back

to the tunnel, where they disappear inside.

INT. TUNNEL - DAY

Chaos. People choking and vomiting. GAS LANTERNS SWING. The

tunnel is 6 feet tall. Buckets are passed, filled with oiled

rags that people use to wipe their faces. Archie takes a

dripping rag and wipes his eyes, nose, mouth.

Vig's mutilated right eye is bleeding.

He screams at Vig, who looks scared.

Vig starts crying. Doc hands a bandage to Archie, who puts it

over Vig's wounded eye socket.

INT. BUNKER - CRUDE CEMENT BATHROOM - DAY

Troy is thrown onto the floor of a cluttered cement bathroom

with two crude toilets. His clothes are thrown on top of him.

The door is slammed. Stolen blenders, radios, CDs, stacks of

new Levis litter the floor. Troy kicks all the crap angrily

and hundreds of cell phones tumble from a box.

Troy looks at the pile of cell phones, picks one up, tries it

for a dial tone, drops it, tries another, until he gets one

that gives him a tone and dials.

Troy looks stunned.

He frantically pushes stuff on the floor to block the door.

The phone is dead.

He throws it to the ground, tries another, no dial tone,

throws it, tries another, no dial tone, throws it.

He tries another, chucks it, another, gets a dial tone,

dials, and waits. Troy dials a number.

He waits while the PHONE RINGS.

Another MORTAR SMASHES through the wall, covers Troy in dust.

Soldiers push at the door, trying to open it.

The door is kicked open and soldiers enter.

The soldiers punch Troy in the face, drag him from the room.

She waits for a moment, tears in her eyes, and hangs up.

They are still walking in the long tunnel.

EXT. OPEN DESERT - DAY

Archie climbs out of a small mound in the desert, squints in

the light and looks around.

A strange minaret stretches skyward from the flat desert, 200

yards away. The minaret is made of yellow stone, it twists

150 feet into the air, like a twisting wedding cake.

Archie leads the others toward the minaret. No one is around,

except for a few black robes. Archie, Doc, and Vig enter the

old wooden doorway of the ancient Minaret.

INT. MINARET HALLWAY - DAY

A line of TEN CHILDREN with missing limbs and bandages stand

and watch Archie, Doc, and Vig enter. They make eye contact.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM, OASIS BUNKER - DAY

CLOSE UP: the hands of an Iraqi soldier carefully wrap a bare

wire around Troy's right ear.

The wire is wrapped under Troy's chin around his other ear.

Troy is smashed in the face with a clipboard.  He looks

angry, and like he could cry at the same time.

Troy is smashed in the face with the clip board.  Blood drips

from his nose.

The Interrogator signals someone O.S. and suddenly voltage

races through the wire, causing Troy to gnash his teeth

together so hard they chip. He writhes in pain.

A SECOND IRAQI gestures defensively at a console that is

connected to the wire around Troy's jaw.  A THIRD IRAQI

reaches forward and turns a dial.  The SECOND IRAQI murmurs

defensively and turns the dial back.

The Interrogator turns back to Troy.

He is jolted again -- his face contorts, he bites his lip.

Troy starts to cry, represses it. His lip is bleeding.

Troy says nothing.

Troy starts shaking slightly.

Emotion comes into the INTERROGATOR'S VOICE as he says this.

The other two guards listen sadly.

CLOSE UP the two guards -- one of them wipes away a tear.

TWO DOZEN PEOPLE are laying down, being treated by SHIITE

CLERICS in black who squeeze aloe onto facial blisters.

At the end of the hall, Archie grits his teeth in pain as a

CLERIC uses a turkey baster to shoot alcohol into his

infected wound. Archie SCREAMS in pain.

Doc paces, exhaling; he has white ointment on his face.

A Shiite changes Vig's bloody bandage, while a DEAD BODY is

laid next to Vig and wrapped in cloths; two clerics chant.

Doc stares at Vig.

Vig reaches out blindly for Doc's hand. Doc looks for a

moment at Vig's hand in the air, reaching, then takes it.

They remain silent for a moment, hands clasped.

Archie walks up, his arm bandaged, and inspects Vig's face.

Archie, Doc, and Vig check the Vuitton suitcases, opening

them, looking at the gold, shutting them.

PAN TO children in bandages watch Archie inventory the gold.

They think.

He looks at Doc and Vig.

They look at Archie.

Doc thinks.

The Shiite Man In Glasses puts oils on his Little Girl's face.

Vig wears glasses over his eye bandage; he mimes the Girl.

They look at him, surprised.

He wipes bits of white foam from the corners of his mouth.

Doc and Vig look at Archie.

Archie looks at him.

Archie looks at Vig and Doc.

Doc and Vig look pissed. Archie's arm is in pain.

Archie looks at him.

He extends his hand. They shake.

Archie looks around. He sees Imam's daughter, other bandaged

children looking at him. A few mothers.

Doc pulls gold bars from a case and holds them up

Fifty Shiites turn and look at him silently. Doc dumps a

whole suitcase of gold bars. Imam translates.

People stare at the gold and say nothing.

His daughter looks at him and laughs -- until her laughter

becomes scary, hysterical and Imam tries to hold her still

and she won't stop as Archie, Doc, Vig watch.

LATER

Archie's arm is in pain as he carefully wraps a thin layer of

light blue plastic explosive around a football, presses small

nails sideways into the plastique and inserts a fuse in the

end of the ball. Another ball-bomb just like it has already

been constructed.

EXT. DESERT -  DAY

Archie leads a line of 55 Shiites across the desert. Everyone

carries at least one Vuitton bag. Imam carries his daughter.

EXT. DESERT - LATER

Archie crouches low to the ground, moving quickly,

yards away, who turns and makes a hand signal to Vig.

HIGH WIDE SHOT: A lone Iraqi military truck, mint condition.'

Archie, Vig, and Doc form a semicircle, surrounding the

truck. They are all 40 yards back from the truck.

No response. Suddenly Vig's pistol FIRES.

His gunshot blows a hole in the Iraqi truck -- which deflates

like a huge beach ball, circling wildly until it lies in a

heap of collapsed camouflage canvass while 50 yards away --

55 SHIITES flip sand-colored blankets off and stand up in the

desert to look. Doc lifts the limp canvass of the deflated

truck.

The Iraqis do not look happy. Imam does simultaneous

An empty ridge. The Infiniti, Rolls, Mercedes shoot over it,

arcing down toward the bunker, engines roaring.

It is quiet. A Slim Jim is unwrapped as an IRAQI GUARD slowly

raises it to his mouth, bites it, chews, and looks puzzled at

The cars drive three abreast down the approach road to the

bunker. The Infiniti is in the middle, flanked by the Rolls

the other. He HEARS the CHIRP of a car alarm being activated

Archie reaches in, grabs his pistol, and bolts as a launched

grenade blows the Mercedes.

12 Iraqi soldiers pour out of the smoking bunker as 3 Shiite

Archie and Doc run down the empty stairs, through the big

main room -- it is empty. Archie goes down the right side,

kicks open a door --

It's the bathroom full of stolen stuff and cell phones --

Doc goes down the left side of the room -- kicks in a door --

a room full of Benneton sweaters in all colors.

Archie kicks in a door -- a room with shelves full of large

snow globes, thousands of them.

Doc kicks in a door -- a room cluttered with debris, but

there is another door at the far side of the room. He

approaches and kicks it repeatedly, without success.

Archie kicks in a door -- it is pitch black -- an emergency

light flickers on and off -- revealing the two Iraqi

torturers at the control table, where one tries to fix the

emergency light with a screwdriver --

In flickering light -- Archie SHOOTS one Iraqi guard squarely

in the chest, then the other -- the only SOUND IS THE GUN

POPPING and the BULLETS TEARING into their bodies.

Archie turns to the Interrogator, who stands next to Troy.

SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION -- Archie shoots the Interrogator in the

thigh. THE ONLY SOUND IS GUN SHOOTING, FLESH TEARING --

Blood thinly splatters across Troy's face as the Interrogator

grimaces and falls to the floor. The light flicks on a few

beats, then off a few beats.

Archie rips the wires from the table controls, goes to Troy,

unhinges the wire from his jaw.

The Interrogator writhes in pain on the ground. Archie takes

the Interrogator's pistol, snaps open a knife, cuts the cord

binding Troy to the chair and gives Troy the pistol.

Troy sits, stained with oil, blood, tears. He gets up, looks

down at the interrogator on the floor, points the pistol into

the Interrogator's face.

The Interrogator stares at Troy, who stares back. Archie

watches, out of breath. Troy FIRES the gun just to the side

of the Interrogator's face, into the ground. The Interrogator

looks terrified, crying. Troy stares back, looks unhappy,

lowers the gun.

Troy and Archie look at each other for an intense moment.

INT. ANOTHER BUNKER ROOM

Doc shoots the lock on the inner door and it finally opens.

He looks inside and sees, in a sunken room, 50 more Shiite

civilians huddled together. Archie rushes by with Troy.

The Tough Iraqi and his partner, sweating profusely, out of

breath, split up and head back toward the bunker.

INT. FRONT DOOR OF BUNKER - DAY

Archie's in great pain. He grimaces as he tightens the

bandage around his forearm. Troy is shaking uncontrollably.

Doc grabs Troy's shoulders firmly.

Troy nods. Archie pulls one of the football bombs wrapped in

C-4 from his small pack, and hands it to Doc.

Archie pretends to throw with nothing in his hand.

PAN ACROSS Troy and Doc listen intently.

Archie cuts the fuse on the ball with his knife.

The three of them stand at the door, ready. Archie holds his

pistol ready. Doc holds the football, Troy holds the lighter.

also FIRING a pistol. Doc follows with the ball, fuse burning.

Doc throws the ball hard at the chopper, hovering 40 feet up.

INT. CHOPPER

The chopper turns to face the ball just as it hits the

plexiglas window and bounces off, not exploding. The pilots

look perplexed. The ball hits the ground and EXPLODES.

EXT. BUNKER

Archie, Troy, Doc, stunned -- turn back to the bunker.

INT. BUNKER DOORWAY - DAY

They run inside and take cover, catch their breath. Troy and

Doc look terrified.

He pulls out the second ball, cuts another fuse, affixes it.

They wait at the door again, watching the chopper.

EXT. BUNKER

Imam, from the side of the bunker, FIRES again, the chopper

swivels toward him to RETURN FIRE --

PAN TO - SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION -- the ball hits the chopper

broadside and THE CHOPPER EXPLODES INTO A BALL OF FIRE.

SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION: The chopper comes crashing to the

ground in a heap of metal. The rotary spins off, whips over

Archie, Troy, and Doc's heads and smashes into the bunker.

Silence.

Troy and Doc look at each other, and punch their fists

together. Troy notices that he's wet his pants.

Archie rolls over bodies lying on the ground, pulls out their

weapons. Troy and Doc take rifles from wounded Iraqis.

Doc nervously scans the area with his pistol pointed.

50 Shiite prisoners start streaming out of the bunker.

Imam directs the Shiites to stay clustered near the bunker.

An IRAQI SOLDIER jumps up just as Archie knocks him to the

ground from behind and twists the gun away. Doc binds the

soldier's hands with a plastic cuff.

Archie pulls pistols from the bloody bodies of the two Iraqis

in the chopper.

He points to the flaming wrecked Infiniti.

He points his pistol at Imam.

Troy and Imam look at each other a moment, Troy still points

his pistol at Imam.

He hugs Imam.

Troy moves nervously.

Troy and Archie look at each other, smile slightly.

They all turn to look.

WIDE SHOT -- Vig pops up in the desert, 150 yards away.

Vig comes running.

Troy smiles as he steps in the direction of Vig. Suddenly a

RIFLE SHOT RINGS OUT, Troy jumps.

SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION -- Vig is hit in the collar bone, ONLY

THE SOUND OF THE BULLET SMASHING HIS FLESH AND BONE. He is

jerked, falls to his knees, but gets up, keeps staggering

toward Troy, 125 yards away.

Troy looks stunned.

Archie turns sharply to his right and FIRES a rifle.

An IRAQI SOLDIER, 150 yards to the side, drops to the ground

as Archie and Doc continue to hit him with gunfire.

Troy runs as hard as he can toward Vig.

Doc looks around frantically with his pistol pointed. Archie

scans the area and directs 3 SHIITE RIFLEMEN to spread out.

Troy runs, catches the staggering Vig in his arms and

embraces him. Blood runs from Vig's mouth, onto Troy's

shoulder, as Vig tries to talk.

Troy cries as he runs with Vig in his arms.

Doc takes Vig from Troy's arms and carefully lays him on the

ground, cradling his head in his lap. Vig spits blood.

The hole in Vig's collar bone is pumping out blood. Troy puts

his hands over it. Doc looks sad and scared as he tries to

turns Vig's head to help him breathe.

50 Shiites -- children and adults -- sit on the ground near

the bunker watch from afar.

around by the shot.

He runs hard across the desert toward Troy.

Troy falls next to Vig and they look at each other.

Troy's eyes are wide with pain as he breathes with great

difficulty -- RASPING.

INT. TROY'S RIB CAGE

His breathing creates an air pocket, crushing his organs to

the left side.

TROY'S POV

looking up at Doc, who is saying something to Troy, but

there's NO SOUND EXCEPT TROY'S LABORED BREATHING

The POV turns to the side -- Vig is no longer breathing.

SOUND

He holds the camera out.

BACK TO THE SCENE - CLOSE UP

Troy lies on the ground, trying to breathe, eyes wide.

TROY'S POV TURNS TO THE SIDE --

FISH EYE LENS - The Jaguar pulls up in SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION.

Imam's Little Girl gets out of the passenger side, SLIGHTLY

SLOW MOTION, NO SOUND. Imam scolds her and gesticulates,

indicating she should be back with the others where it is

safe. The Little Girl embraces Imam and stares down at Troy

over her father's shoulder.

EXT. DESERT

Troy's eyes are wide, staring up at the Girl as he has great

difficulty breathing. Archie rolls Troy's shirt up, exposing

Troy's chest, with the bullet wound. Archie points to a spot

on Troy's upper chest, near the collar bone --

Doc squeezes a small tube of brown disinfectant gel onto this

spot -- the only sounds are the squirt of the ointment and

Troy's breathing.

Archie plunge the scalpel into his upper chest. Archie twists

the scalpel to open the incision wide --

There is a pronounced HISSING as trapped air rushes out. Huge

relief comes over Troy's face as he breathes normally.

Regular sound FADES BACK IN, THE FIRST SOUND IS THE GIRL'S

THIN, INTERMITTENT HUMMING --

TROY'S POV FROM THE GROUND, LOOKING UP

He tears open a short I.V. tube and plunges the I.V. into the

which he tightens.

A GUNSHOT SOUNDS -- Archie turns and looks over --

either way. There are 50 IRAQI GROUND TROOPS standing at the

CHOPPERS ARE HEARD in the distance. They grow LOUDER. Imam

turns and looks back. Archie turns around and looks.

SIX APACHE CHOPPERS approach from the distance

CLOSE DOLLY Archie.

He lets go of Troy and starts jogging toward the border. Troy

cannot jog, he crouches down, and is passed by the others.

The Shiites look up at the choppers as they jog. Doc and

Walter look up also. Archie does not.

Havichon in the Humvee swings the mounted gun up to the

choppers as they pass overhead, loud.

Troy pulls away from MPS, resisting arrest.

Archie and Doc, not resisting, are handcuffed in front --

He and Doc are pulled away from Troy.

Iraqi soldiers take the Shiites prisoner, grabbing them,

throwing some to the ground. Troy looks over his shoulder at

this as Imam's daughter is ripped from his arms and he is

thrown to the ground and dragged.

He collapses to one knee.

Troy grimaces on the ground, he can't breathe, but the cuffs

prevent him from releasing his valve. Troy struggles.

Captain Van Meter leans down to Troy. He shouts over the

choppers.

Troy lies on the ground suffocating. Archie drags the MP

holding him as he goes to General Horn.

General Horn walks away as MPS stare at Troy on the ground,

concerned.

A US SOLDIER stares -- upset by what's happening, reaches in

his pocket, pulls out a hunting knife, pops the blade,

crouches down to Troy, exchanges a look with the MP standing

by, and cuts Troy's plastic cuffs. Troy reaches with

difficulty to the valve on his chest turns it -- and breathes.

Archie pulls away from the MPs holding him and runs toward

the lead truck -- where MPs grab and wrestle him down.

An MP jumps into the truck, pushes the barrel over; 30 gold

bars spill to the sand.

The General looks at the gold. Troy and Doc, held in custody,

watch.  The General makes a 'CUT' signal to the choppers --

and the chopper engines cut off and whir down; it grows QUIET.

THE U.S. Soldiers -- holding Walter and the Drivers in

custody -- stand and watch Archie.

General Horn picks up a gold brick.

Meter pushes Cathy's camera down.

MPs take the tapes from the cameras.

He signals the choppers to start up.

THE CHOPPER ENGINES SLOWLY WHINE into gear.

General Horn walks over to Troy, Archie, and Doc.

He walks into a chopper, which is now revving at full speed.

PAN TO Troy, Archie, Doc turn to the border and watch.

Soldiers also watch.

The Shiites are released by the Iraqis. They collect

themselves and gather in a group. The group walks over the

border and is received by the relief workers.

Troy, Archie, Doc watch. A U.S. Soldier WHISTLES through the

loud choppers.

Then another Soldier joins in, WHISTLING and CLAPPING.

Then another soldier, until all twenty U.S.

Soldiers and MPs present are whistling and cheering Troy,

Archie, and Doc as they stand there while the choppers throb.

50 yards away: Imam holds his daughter, on the Iran side,

about to get into a Red Crescent bus.
