A planet of massive, tortured ROCK FORMS, distant cities

constructed atop and underneath them. A HOVER-SPEEDER in the

mid-ground kicks up dust, backlit by the sun, as it traces the

horizon. We PAN WITH IT, revealing a FAMILY HOME, built

seamlessly into a rocky mountainside.

A SUPER READS: STARDATE 2230.06.

The speeder parks outside the home --

SAREK (late 40's, a Vulcan) comes out to the balcony through the

rear doors of the home. He moves to Amanda and kneels. He

looks at the child -- his child -- and says:

She looks at him for a beat, then says, flatly -- with just

enough rancor:

He regards her.   Knows he's in TROUBLE --

The Vulcan Midwives share a look. Sarek glances at them. Nods.

The two women excuse themselves. Sarek reaches over, touches a

small touchpad -- the HARPSICHORD MUSIC STOPS. He says,

clinically:

Sad that she has to tell him this at all, she just looks back at

the baby -- finding comfort in his innocence. Sarek considers

this. He moves closer to her. Whispers intimately:

And with her free hand, she pulls Sarek closer -- and kisses

him. And the two look at the baby.

She looks at the baby, not immediately taken by the name.

She looks at Sarek: Spock it is.

She pulls back the baby's swaddling, revealing his ears.    She

gently rubs the top of his right ear -- AND IT UNFURLS,

revealing a small, soft pointed VULCAN EAR.

And off the image of this TINY BABY, half-human, half-Vulcan,

we... FADE OUT. And over BLACKNESS, we BEGIN TO HEAR an ALARM

SOUNDING -- GROWING -- and the SUPER "THREE YEARS LATER" APPEARS

-- and finally the BLACKNESS IS SPLIT BY TURBO-LIFT DOORS

OPENING and we REVEAL THAT WE'RE ON:

With URGENCY, we MOVE DOWN a corridor with CAPTAIN ROBAU and

OFFICER PITTS:

-- our sensors haven't made        -- no sir, it looked like a

sense of the anomaly?              lightning storm in the middle

-- how far are we from the         of space --

Klingon Neutral Zone?              -- 150,000 kilometers, but the

SHWISH! The doors part and we enter THE BRIDGE OF THE SHIP -- a

flurry of activity -- the MASSIVE SHIP they are approaching on

the VIEWSCREEN. Robau moves to the center -- then he asks:

-- turning to the ship's FIRST OFFICER: 32, all-American face,

swiveling in a console chair to FACE US:

Are they transmitting on any       Negative, Captain -- all

frequency?                         communications appear to be

Hail the ship. What's the          Nothing even close, Sir.

closest match on registry?

Robau moves to Pitts:

Robau sits in the captain's chair his eyes on the ship as they

approach -- and we SEE IT on the VIEWSCREEN -- THE NARADA --

ENORMOUS AND THREATENING. He doesn't even realize that he says:

And in the endless vacuum of space, and in TOTAL SILENCE, the

Kelvin appears as a dot, coming to a stop in front of the

gigantic BLACK CLAW that is the Narada --

Crew members are glued to their telemetry, working consoles:

Suddenly, a WARNING BEEP --

Sir, I have a reading --

they've locked weapons on us!     -- Red alert!   Arm weapons!

ALARMS BLARE -- LIGHTS GO RED as --

The Narada FIRES a TORPEDO -- IT HEADS FOR THE KELVIN -- then

SEPARATES, fracturing into a multi-hit projectile --

Officers SCRAMBLE, brace for impact --

Torpedo locked on us at 320

degrees, mark two -- incoming      -- Evasive pattern Delta-5!

fast!

A direct hit SMASHES several decks along the DISH of the ship --

In the massive Engine Room, a HUGE BLAST -- MEN GO FLYING IN THE

STEEL-SHATTERING EXPLOSION --

Captain Robau helps a fallen CREW MEMBER up from the floor --

then, on his chair com.:

INTERCUT with:

Moving with the Kelvin's CHIEF ENGINEER:

As the crew regains their footing, the First Officer pulls

himself to his console, true fear in his eyes as he places an

inter-ship call -- it's RINGING -- his fear grows with every

passing RING -- then, we INTERCUT WITH:

A WOMAN, 25, answers her communicator -- she lies on an exam

table, afraid -- and pregnant. This is WINONA.

But the First Officer is just relieved that she's still alive:

Or maybe not:

ANOTHER NARADA TORPEDO -- it SEPARATES, pieces HIT the Kelvin.

Chief Engineer RUNS past us -- CONSUMED BY A SUDDEN EXPLOSION!

A FEMALE CREW MEMBER running down the hall suddenly HOLDS ON as

a HOLE IS RIPPED IN THE HALL -- and she's YANKED OUT OF THE

CORRIDOR -- the CAMERA finally getting sucked out too!

-- life support failing on           -- this is the U.S.S. Kelvin,

decks seven through thirteen!        attemping to reach Starfleet

We have confirmed casualties,        command on subspace! Repeat --

Sir!                                 U.S.S. Kelvin, under attack by

-- shields at eleven percent         -- were our shields even up?

and dropping! Ten percent --         That was like nothing I've

we're at nine! Eight percent!        ever seen -- this ship can not

Seven! We're dropping here!          take another hit like that!

Six!

And he STOPS. They all do. A fucking FACE is now on their

VIEWSCREEN. A ROMULAN FACE -- the FIRST OFFICER of the Narada,

whom we'll come to know as AYEL:

Screen goes DEAD. All eyes on Robau... and he feels them.      A

tense, horrible moment. Finally, to the First Officer:

The First Officer follows Robau OFF THE BRIDGE AND INTO:

As they walk, briskly:

Robau heads into a waiting TURBOLIFT, turns -- they lock eyes,

knowing what this means. Finally:

He's gone.   And we realize this is GEORGE KIRK, Jim's father.

All eyes on Kirk as he enters -- moves to the captain's chair.

Sits. Not a small moment. Speaking his first words as Captain:

In a moment, Robau's VITAL SIGNS appear on various monitors --

his HEART RATE, OXYGEN LEVELS, BLOOD PRESSURE, all of it. A LOW-

PITCHED BEEPBEEP of his HEARTBEAT is now HEARD --

TILT DOWN as the TURBO-LIFT DESCENDS -- we PUSH IN as the doors

open and Captain Robau gets out -- moves quickly -- hurries down

a SHUTTLE BAY catwalk --

Robau enters a shuttle -- LIGHTS BLINK to life.   He moves to the

cockpit -- starts the vehicle up --

A LOUD HISS and the craft SHUDDERS as it disembarks --

Sparks dripping from the ceiling, everyone is motionless -- eyes

on the monitors -- and we're TIGHT ON GEORGE KIRK -- the BEEPS

of Robau's heart might as well be representing his own. He

realizes he's sweating -- wipes his forehead as:

Two MASSIVE FLOODLIGHTS on the Kelvin's dish GO HOT -- and turn,

FLARING out the lens -- landing on the SHUTTLE as it leaves the

KELVIN, heading toward the imposing Narada.

Backlit by the distant floodlights, Robau remains steely-eyed as

he moves for the darkened ship -- nerves --

And Robau's HEARTBEAT QUICKENS -- the tension they all feel:

Robau watches as he gets closer, the BEEPBEEPING HEARD over the

SOUNDS of the shuttle -- but then --

ALL WE HEAR IS THE LOW-PITCHED BEEPBEEP as the small shuttle

seems to get swallowed up by the massive forward-facing spires

of the Narada -- the distant floodlights creating EERIE SHADOWS

everywhere. A gigantic IRIS DOOR TURNS, SLOWLY OPENS -- and the

shuttle enters the Narada's main HANGAR -- the door CLOSES --

And everyone is just motionless and silent. Only Robau's VITAL

SIGNS can be HEARD, BEEPING away. George's eyes glued ahead --

TIGHT ON ROBAU as he faces the shuttle door, considering his

fate. Finally the SHUTTLE DOOR OPENS -- standing there are

eight ROMULAN GUARDS, brandishing WEAPONS. He steps down. They

grab him, hard -- he's SCANNED -- FRISKED -- PULLED ALONG -- and

we REVEAL the absolutely MASSIVE HANGAR, the insane architecture

of the interior of this dark, wet, dripping ship --

Robau is led into the enormous, dark bridge. A dozen Romulans

at controls. Robau does his level best to portray confidence as

he is led up a walkway to AYEL. Behind him, sitting silhouetted

and motionless, turned away and looking off, is his captain. A

presence always felt in this scene. This is NERO.

Ayel touches a panel, then THROWS AN IMAGE into the air before

Robau. A ROTATING HOLOGRAM OF A UNIQUE-LOOKING SPACECRAFT (we

will refer to it as the JELLYFISH).

Robau regards it.   Then:

Robau considers the hologram again.     And what his answer might

mean for the fate of his crew.

Ayel has thrown another HOLOGRAM -- A FLOATING, ROTATING IMAGE

OF SPOCK, who appears to be 75 earth-years old. The baby, born

just three years earlier. Robau is as confused as we are...

Suddenly: TSCHING! Nero's activated his STAFF -- FOUR LARGE,

HORRIFYING BLADES APPEAR AT THE TIP AND NERO SPRINGS TO LIFE,

CHARGING ROBAU WITH A ROAR AND ROBAU'S EYES POP HOLY SHIT AND--

BLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE... Robau's vitals go dead.      PUSH IN ON

KIRK as a SCREAMING ALARM IS HEARD --

They're launching again!           Evasive! Evasive! Delta-Five

The Kelvin BANKS as it FIRES WILDLY -- another TORPEDO BLASTING

FROM THE NARADA -- it SEPARATES -- some miss, OTHERS HIT!

Debris FLIES TROUGH THE CEILING, SLAMMING INTO A BRIDGE SUPPORT

BEAM! Green COOLANT SPEWS from under the floor grating --

TIGHT ON GEORGE as this lands.      More honorable than terrified:

Agony in the faces as they reluctantly hurry off -- Kirk takes

the Captain's chair, hits the COMLINK:

MOVE FAST around Winona, in fucking labor now -- being

transferred onto a wheelchair by the Doctor and Nurse--

-- repeat: evacuate ship and

get to designated shuttles           -- that's George's voice --

NOW!                                 what's happening?

-- and she's on the move, out the door as her COMMUNICATOR

SOUNDS -- she answers --

Alone now on the bridge, piloting this massive craft by himself -

- George talks to Winona from the Captain's chair --

HOLD ON GEORGE for a moment as he hesitates -- his eyes glued to

the screens as he pilots --

PUSH IN on him, his heart shattering -- having to out-maneuver

incoming torpedoes, piloting the ship to its doom -- still, he

forces optimism:

He disconnects -- another ALARM -- he TURNS the ship, FIRES --

The Kelvin BANKS AGAIN -- its PHOTONS SLAMMING INTO THE ONCOMING

NARADA TORPEDOES, JUST AVOIDING IMPACT!

CREW MEMBERS scramble to their shuttles as the ship TREMBLES --

and we find WINONA among them, being PUSHED through the madness.

The Med-Team ARRIVES with Winona in the wheelchair-- it's CHAOS -

- and for Winona, a huge contraction --

-- as they put her into the shuttle bed:

As George Kirk pilots, he checks the monitors -- one reads the

COUNTDOWN TO SELF-DESTRUCT (180 SECONDS, 179 SECONDS, 178

SECONDS...) and another reads IMPACT PROXIMITY (36,054 METERS,

36,042, 36018...).

Another screen that shows stats of DEPARTING SHUTTLES -- more

leaving as we glance at the screen -- but SHUTTLE 34 REMAINS

DOCKED --

The NARADA is GROWING in the viewscreen -- he hits the comlink:

INTERCUT WITH:

The PILOT is readying the controls --

Shuttle Pilot works the controls -- and Winona, in the back,

feels the shuttle SHUDDER --

-- but she's suddenly WINCING as another CONTRACTION hits --

Clamps holding the shuttle SLAM BACK, the MED-SHUTTLE DROPS

HARD, FUSION IMPULSE ENGINES IGNITE and the shuttle MOVES --

George hits COMLINK -- a TONE -- then WINONA'S VOICE:

As George EVADES ENEMY FIRE, heading for the massive alien ship:

INTERCUT WITH:

Winona, holding her communicator --

And she just stares -- realizing what's happening -- that he's

been made Captain -- that there was an evacuation -- and somehow

she just KNOWS. Tears come to her eyes --

I want you to hear me.

Please.                           Are you still on the ship? No-

-- There's no other way-- my      - no, you need to be here--

love-- you know all I want--      -- George, I can't do this

all I want in the world is to     without you--

be with you--                        (crying now)

-- but she's WINCING AGAIN --

-- and she does -- the shuttle BANKS and --

-- and the shuttle LEAVES the Kelvin bay -- turning to join

DOZENS of other shuttles, all heading off in escape --

As George PILOTS, DODGING INCOMING -- we INTERCUT WITH:

Winona PUSHING -- giving birth to their baby -- and we're BACK

AND FORTH between a husband and wife that will never see each

other again, MUSIC SWELLING as the Kelvin TURNS HARD, avoiding

TORPEDOES -- the shuttle BANKING as the Doctor and Nurse help

Winona -- and we're ON GEORGE as he HEARS A BABY CRYING -- and

TEARS COME TO HIS EYES -- as he says--

And now we see Winona, handed this beautiful little boy.   And

she cries, just looking at him --

Heartsick, George laughs -- glances at the MONITORS -- SELF-

DESTRUCT COUNTDOWN IS AT T-MINUS 20 SECONDS -- oh God...

Through the VIEWSCREEN -- he's ABOUT TO HIT -- the ship ANGLES

within the enormous Narada blades -- George scared now --

Sweetheart? Sweetheart? I

love you. Can you hear me?          -- yes-- yes, I hear you...

-- I love you. I love y--

-- his VOICE CUT OFF as --

-- the Kelvin SLAMS INTO THE NARADA -- an EXPLOSION BEGINS and--

George's voice goes STATIC -- confusion washes over her face --

suddenly LIT BY A BRIGHT GLOW -- she looks over, with wet

devastated eyes --

-- what she sees is the MASSIVE EXPLOSION -- quickly SUCKED AWAY

in the vacuum of space -- and she's CRYING -- holding her new

baby who just lost a father -- his life altered forever...

The shuttle SAILS AWAY with the others... HOLD ON THIS... for a

long beat. Then PAN OVER to see NERO'S SHIP TUMBLING SILENTLY

THROUGH SPACE -- DEBRIS still raining from the explosion --

MAYHEM: ALARMS and CREW work to stabilize the ship (OVERLAPPING

ROMULAN DIALOG TO BE WRITTEN) -- we arrive at Nero, who, with

small specks of HUMAN BLOOD on his face, just STARES at the

fucking HOLOGRAM OF SPOCK -- he's OBSESSED.

Ayel works a monitor, yelling out something (in Romulan) to one

of their men -- and as a result:

Gargantuan "BLADES" EXTEND from the ship like otherworldly SAILS

-- and the ship begins to STEADY -- but then ANOTHER SHIP

APPEARS -- DECLOAKING FROM NOTHINGNESS: a fucking KLINGON VESSEL

-- then ANOTHER -- AND ANOTHER --

And we're on Ayel as he witnesses, on his monitor, ships,

popping up ALL AROUND THEM -- which is when they HEAR a VOICE --

speaking KLINGON -- and we SUBTITLE:

A glare to George and Frank walks off. Jim nervously follows

his brother, pulling out a small, FLOATING DISC --

George hits it away:

But Jim can offer nothing. George gives him a quick hug and

walks off. Jim sadly watches his brother go.

Kirk washes a VINTAGE CORVETTE. Red, white top. Dumping the

sponge in bucket, he's sadly cleaning, his mind spinning over

his brother's departure. Devastated.

And he's wiping the soapy passenger window (SQEEEEEEAK!) with

the sponge, when he STOPS -- seeing the KEYS in the ignition.

PUSH IN ON HIS FACE as a devilish idea comes to his mind. PRE-

LAP A LOUD SCREECH and we CUT TO:

THE CORVETTE BLASTS ONTO SCREEN, FISHTAILING ONTO THE ROAD,

young Jim Kirk behind the wheel (NOTE: The SOUND of the engine

is a metallic WHIR -- not a gas engine). TIGHT ON JIM'S FACE as

he drives -- having never done this before, he's as nervous as

he is determined --

The CORVETTE SPEEDS -- while inside the car, Jim turns on the

updated, modified RADIO -- scans stations, momentarily losing

control of the car -- but he's back on track as he finds a HARD

ROCK SONG -- and HE'S STARTING TO FUCKING LOVE IT -- PILOTING

SOMETHING THIS FAST FEELS GOOD.

He reaches for a CONVERTIBLE ROOF latch -- then the other -- but

with the speed he's driving, THE ROOF RIPS RIGHT OFF THE FUCKING

CAR -- Jim glances back, wide-eyed -- and the roof TUMBLES

through the air, landing on the road -- and we PUSH AND ARC

AROUND, as a POLICE OFFICER runs out from taking a roadside PISS

-- he races back, jumps on his HOVERCRUISER and TAKES OFF --

SPEEDING AFTER HIM, SIREN BLARING!

BACK IN THE CORVETTE -- BLOOPBLOOP!!! -- Jim's eyes dart to the

REARVIEW as the cruiser WEAVES behind him -- then PULLS UP

BESIDE HIM -- the COP sees a CHILD driving and is AMAZED -- he

calls through his PA:

But Jim just BLASTS the RADIO LOUDER:

George, bag over shoulder, thumb out. He turns at the SOUND of

the SIREN -- sees what's approaching... that car... looks...

familiar... and the THE CORVETTE SHOOTS PAST HIM, JIM AT THE

WHEEL -- then the POLICE HOVERCRUISER! George runs into the

middle of the road, mouth agape --

Back at the Corvette, Jim YANKS the steering wheel TOWARD THE

COP -- who RISES to avoid the Corvette, which SCREECHES onto a

perpendicular DIRT ROAD, kicking up wild dust as the Cop ARCS

QUICKLY to follow --

And the ALIEN SPEAKS -- an UNKNOWN LANGUAGE -- all eyes wild:

But the Alien just SHAKES HIS HEAD, afraid -- he will not talk.

So they GRAB HIM AND YANK HIM UPWARD --

PUSH IN TIGHT as the Alien finally WHISPERS, terrified:

And the Guards look at each other... seemingly with concern...

MOMENTS LATER EIGHT GUARDS WALK TOGETHER -- and we PAN WITH THEM

to reveal the HORRIFYING EXPANSE THAT IS THE KLINGON PRISON

YARD. We realize that the constant shocks of light was

LIGHTNING, that apparently never stops here. A SUPER READS:

"RURA PENTHE - KLINGON PRISON ASTEROID". And we see they're

heading for a MUSCULAR FIGURE, using a SLEDGE HAMMER, SPLITTING

ROCKS, lit brilliantly by the lightning strikes. BOOM UP to

find that it's NERO. And he stops, SENSING the coming Guards.

And he manages a small smile. And he QUICKLY TURNS to them --

THEY ALL STOP, SUDDENLY. Afraid of him. One of them tosses

Nero a set of MANACLES. Nero picks them up. Puts them on. And

offers his cuffed hands, willingly.

Guards drag Nero through the massive pyramidal structure...

Nero's ARMS AND LEGS get STRAPPED IN TIGHT. Go WIDE to reveal

he's pinned to an interrogation table -- three GUARDS. A

KLINGON INTERROGATOR approaches; looms over Nero, studying the

Romulan's face with clinical detachment...

(NOTE: FROM NOW ON, OUR NON-ENGLISH SPEAKERS WILL SPEAK ENGLISH,

UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.) He reveals a worn LEATHER JOURNAL.

Opens it, flips through it almost casually... we see SKETCHES of

the JELLYFISH SHIP, PAGES OF COMPLICATED MATH EQUATIONS...

Nero's face betrays nothing; no fear, no doubt. Cold as fucking

ice.   The Interrogator happens to stare at a page in the book:

A DRAWING OF SPOCK. He closes the book.

Interrogator looks over to the Guards, nods. A Guard approaches

with some kind of GLASS CONTAINER; we HEAR something wet FLIP-

FLOPPING around inside, but we can't SEE what it is.

A Guard uses TONGS to pull out the most DISGUSTING creature

you've seen from the container: a SLUG with SUCKERS and spikes,

covered in a grimy muck -- it FLIP FLOPS.

A Guard GRABS NERO'S HEAD and FORCES IT BACK; the second PRIES

HIS MOUTH OPEN with his hands.

Another Guard SHOVES THE THING INTO NERO'S MOUTH -- Nero keeps

his eyes open -- furiously determined not to be broken -- as

they FORCE HIM TO SWALLOW IT -- he DOESN'T SCREAM as the

wretched thing makes its way down his esophagus and into his

stomach --

Nero stares at the ceiling in HORRIFYING INTERNAL PAIN -- but

straining to block it out. PUSH DOWN on Nero's wide, crazed

eyes -- TIGHTER as we SLOWLY DISSOLVE TO SEE WHAT HE'S SEEING --

WHAT'S KEEPING HIM FROM LOSING HIS MIND -- DREAMLIKE, ETHEREAL

IMAGES OF A WOMAN -- HER BEAUTIFUL, SMILING FACE -- SHE'S

ROMULAN -- LOOKING AT US, EYES FULL OF LOVE -- AND SHE TURNS AND

WE SEE SHE'S PREGNANT -- AND AS OUR MUSIC BUILDS, WE CUT TO:

Quiet. A waiting area. AMANDA, Spock's mother, stands alone in

a passageway. She looks off-camera to her son:

Reluctantly, Spock walks into frame. She begins adjusting his

collar. This is our ADULT SPOCK. Gripped by anxiety but trying

like hell to look impassive.

She just smiles as she works his collar. He sees this and    it

annoys him. He tries to move her hands away, to stop with    his

collar -- his annoyance, her love for him, all sweet-- but   he

doesn't let go of her hands. A meaningful silence between    them.

As the TREK THEME SOARS, the shuttle ascends and we...

OVER BLACK: "THREE YEARS LATER".

FADE IN:

Nero lies on the floor of his cell, semi-conscious, looking like

death. Behind him the DOOR OPENS. Two KLINGON GUARDS enter,

backlit.

And they both lift his limp body up -- as something miraculous

happens -- NERO SNAPS TO LIFE AND SINGLE-HANDEDLY BEATS THE SHIT

OUT OF THE GUARDS -- TAKING THEM BOTH DOWN IN TEN SECONDS -- in

what seems like an instant, he's the only one standing here --

holding both of the Guards' rifles -- which he TWIRLS, badass.

PUSH IN ON THE DOOR as it opens -- Ayel, chained, looks up,

intensely -- and sees that it's NERO who has arrived -- we PUSH

IN TIGHT ON HIM as he SPEAKS FOR THE FIRST TIME:

Off Ayel, we CUT TO:

TILT DOWN from a GLIMMERING BUILDING TO REVEAL a sea of RED

CADET UNIFORMS: HUNDREDS OF CADETS head across campus, McCoy and

Kirk among them. A miraculous view of San Francisco beneath a

blue sky, Golden Gate Bridge piercing the air. Kirk struts:

And with a smile, Kirk heads off -- McCoy watches him go,

calling after him:

In MOONLIGHT, a beautiful WOMAN lies on her back, in some kind

of bra, moaning in delight -- this is GAILA --

Gaila reaches over, turns on the light and we realize: SHE'S

GREEN. And not particularly happy:

-- but you can only open it

tomorrow at three o'clock on

the dot --                        -- what are you talking about?

-- Gaila, promise me you're

not going to open it 'till        -- what is it?    Tell me what

three --                          it says!

-- I'll erase it, I swear, if

you don't promise me you'll       -- All right!!    Three o'clock!

wait --                           I prom--

They're INTERRUPTED by a DOOR OPENING -- GASP!

Ayel hides his disappointment behind his eyes as suddenly -- A

LIGHTNING STORM -- impossibly, from nowhere -- LOTS OF IT -- and

through the lightning erupts THE JELLYFISH -- THE SHIP NERO HAS

BEEN LOOKING FOR DECADES.

And we won't know where we are as MUSIC BUILDS and we CUT TO:

Uhura TURNS TO US, at her comm station -- PUSH IN on her.     She

seems wildly BORED and almost RESENTFUL:

WHIP TO THE COMMAND CHAIR, where KIRK captains the battered

bridge. Confident -- cocky:

She glares, turns away.      Then McCoy, at a console, reports:

McCoy and Uhura -- and the others -- look at him, confused.

McCoy and Uhura share a look -- that's when we CUT TO:

Looking at the bridge from above, we PULL BACK to reveal an

observation room above the faux-ship. This is the test Kirk was

referring to. CONSOLE TECHNICIANS monitor the proceedings. A

TEST ADMINISTRATOR turns to another and asks:

And we CONTINUE TO PULL BACK TO REVEAL that, sitting among the

technicians, is Gaila. Our resident GREEN GIRL. She checks her

watch -- PUSH IN ON IT: 2:59 PM. On her MONITOR awaits a 23rd

century e-mail -- a MESSAGE FROM KIRK --

Annoyed, she does as:

CLOSE ON GAILA'S WATCH as it changes to 3:00 -- and she   opens

Jim's message -- and all it reads is, "I'M SORRY." And    just

then something UPLOADS and EXECUTES and ALL THE SCREENS   IN HERE

AND ON THE BRIDGE DIE -- THE SYSTEM CRASHES -- everyone   reacts --

The crew doesn't know what's up -- except Kirk, who is

remarkably pleased -- when the LIGHTS AND MONITORS COME BACK ON,

things are not the same:

McCoy looks at his monitor.   No they're not.

They fire -- AND DESTROY ALL FIVE KLINGON SHIPS INSTANTLY.    All

mouths here are agape.

For the first time, Kirk looks up to the testing room windows:

And they're stunned up here, too -- Test Administrator #2 turns

to someone OFF-CAMERA:

REVEAL who he was talking to: SPOCK is here.      And not happy.

TIGHT ON a stern STARFLEET ACADEMY PRESIDENT:

It's a huge Starfleet chamber. Golden Gate Bridge visible

through huge windows. 500 cadets, a nervous KIRK among them.

He stands, moves to one of two PODIUMS.

Ow-- what for?                      To give you symptoms.

-- I don't understand--             -- you're gonna start to lose

-- yeah, I already have --          -- don't stand up yet --

-- what'd you do to me?             -- you're gonna get a really

-- this is a favor?!                -- yeah, you're welcome.

McCoy ushers Kirk out of the room --

McCoy ushers Kirk to a shuttle -- a SCANNING OFFICER stops them:

And with that, he pulls Kirk past the speechless officer --

A fleet of SHUTTLES depart Starfleet -- head out to space --

Kirk, in agony, sweating, sits beside McCoy as they pass through

the stratosphere. McCoy's peering out a window --

WHIP PAN to the helm: HIKARU SULU turns to Pike -- at 25, he's

the Federation's best pilot. As he works the controls:

The Enterprise moves away from the dock -- smaller SATELLITE

crafts floating around it. The other FIVE STARFLEET SHIPS

already ahead -- moving into position.

MEDICAL STAFF preps. McCoy enters with Kirk, in amusing agony --

McCoy helps him onto a bed, prepares another hypospray.

-- oh, this wasn't worth it --

I wish I didn't know you-- I'm

itching in my mouth, this is         Here's a short-lasting

horrible--                           sedative -- those symptoms

And he SHOOTS KIRK with another hypospray --

As Sulu works the controls --

And Sulu does and --

The six ships -- ONE, then TWO, then THREE, then FOUR, then FIVE

SNAP INTO WARP. The Enterprise, however... just sits there.

Pike -- and the others -- look at Sulu, who is confused --

concerned -- searching the controls. Finally:

Sulu does -- and realizes Spock is right.     He makes it work.

And now alone, the Enterprise SNAPS INTO WARP -- and is gone.

CLOSE ON a small Vulcan object. SHAKING, as if in a small

earthquake. BOOM UP to find Amanda as she moves through her

home, out to the balcony -- and in the distance, a mile away, is

a massive COLUMN OF LIGHT -- like a ray from God, which creates

NUKE-LIKE CONCENTRIC CLOUDS and massive DIRT AND DUST, slamming

into the ground. Amanda's eyes go wide with terror --

Looking DOWN towards Vulcan at the gigantic DRILLING PLATFORM,

the SOURCE of the PLASMA RAY -- and we TILT UP to see that the

platform is HUNG ON A WIDE TETHER -- and we KEEP TILTING UNTIL

WE SEE THE TETHER IS ATTACHED TO THE NARADA, in orbit above the

planet --

Nero stares at holographic images of Vulcan -- as Ayel arrives

behind him.

Ayel heads off --

Ayel enters the massive hangar -- where SPOCK'S JELLYFISH SHIP

SITS. Ayel moves to, enters the Jellyfish --

Ayel moves into the CONTAINMENT HOLD -- a METALLIC ROOM

containing a large, floating RED BALL -- some kind of energy

source. Ayel observes TWO ROMULANS EXTRACTING some of this Red

Matter, sucking it into a tube --

Workers place the tube of Red Matter into a SPACE POD.

The journey's underway.   The bridge crew monitors systems:

A MAP appears -- locates her --

Kirk RUNS OUT -- McCoy hurrying after him with a bag of gear:

Kirk and McCoy enter -- Kirk stops, looks around --

And McCoy INJECTS HIM WITH ANOTHER SHOT --

And Kirk runs into a ENORMOUS SPACE -- giant STEEL COLLECTOR

TANKS surround a dozen workstations where CREW MEMBERS collect

data -- Kirk races to Uhura --

Kirk hides his hands behind his back -- as he talks it becomes

MUFFLED AND SLURRED --

Kirk grabs a pen with his huge hands and writes -- shows her

what he's written: "THE SHIP - WAS IT ROMULAN?" Uhura looks at

him -- somehow scared -- as McCoy INJECTS HIM AGAIN:

EPIC WIDE SHOT: Amanda's a spec against the MASSIVE, EAR-

SPLITTING PLASMA TWISTER. The image is almost religious. POP

CLOSER to her face -- mesmerized, terrified -- suddenly: a

HOVERSPEEDER RACES IN behind her, at the controls is SAREK:

She turns to him in horror --

Bridge doors WHOOSH OPEN as Kirk RUNS IN, followed by Uhura and

a harried McCoy --

-- Mr. Kirk! How the hell did

you get on board the                 This man is under the

Enterprise?!                         influence of a severe reaction

ON THE CREW as that lands.     But most specifically, SPOCK.

Rebuked, McCoy exits as:

As you know, Mr. Kirk is not

cleared to be aboard this

vessel. By Starfleet                  Yeah, I get it, you're a

regulations, that makes him a        great arguer, I'd love to do

stowaway...                          it again with you, too.

I can remove the cadet from          -- Try it! This cadet is

the bridge, Sir --                   trying to save the bridge!

-- By recommending a full stop

in trans-warp in the midst of

a rescue mission?                    -- It's not a rescue mission--

-- Based on what facts?

ON KIRK.   Enough.     And cadet or not, the bridge is HIS.

Kirk just points to Uhura.

All eyes on Pike.   He looks to Spock, who could screw Kirk

here... But--

Uhura sits at the console -- she PUTS ON THE EARPIECE. We've

just watched the birth of an icon. She works the controls --

LIGHTS GO RED. HOLD ON THE FACES of our people -- AFRAID,

HEARTS POUNDING as they dread what they're about to see --

SUDDENLY, AS THE ENTERPRISE DROPS OUT OF WARP, THE FLAMING HULL

OF A STARFLEET SHIP COMES BARRELING RIGHT AT THE BRIDGE!

EMERGENCY EVASIVE!                ON IT, SIR!

Sulu   DIPS the Enterprise FAST AND HARD and the spinning debris

JUST   SCARS the ship. The bridge shakes, but rights itself. THE

CREW   SEES THE NARADA FLOATING ABOVE THE PLANET -- THEIR EYES GO

WIDE   AT THE MONUMENTAL SHIP -- meanwhile, inside:

A PROXIMITY ALARM rings out --

Spock snaps to Pike as images FLASH on his console --

The Narada FIRES A TORPEDO and in a wild move, the Enterprise

DROPS AND TUMBLES -- the SEPARATING TORPEDO passes RIGHT BETWEEN

THE ENTERPRISE'S NACELLES -- ONE PIECE HITS our hero ship's

DEFLECTOR DISH -- another the MAIN DISH and --

A CREW MEMBER runs through the machine room catwalks as a HUGE

EXPLOSION sends him -- and large steel tanks -- TUMBLING INTO

SPACE --

We see the ship from a distance -- the scale of the destruction

relatively small --

Photons LOADED fast by CREW MEMBERS and --

The Enterprise SWOOPS AROUND, firing photons at the Narada which

takes the hits in stride --

The bridge in action --

And just before our heroes are blown into oblivion, Nero

suddenly LURCHES FORWARD and stabs out a hand:

Nero's eyes are hard and bright as diamond drills:

On screen, the Enterprise's hull is revealed "U.S.S. ENTERPRISE

NCC-1701." Nero LIGHTS UP with recognition --

Pike on the comm:

But Pike stops when he sees, on the viewscreen

Pike looks over -- nods -- Uhura works controls and on

viewscreen, Nero appears. Cool. Cordial. In English:

CLOSE ON KIRK -- breathless -- suddenly staring at the man who

murdered his father -- holy SHIT...

All eyes on Spock.   Spock looks to Pike, who nods permission:

The transmission ENDS.   The crew stares in grave anticipation --

-- he'll kill you, you know

that--                               Your survival is unlikely--

-- Captain, we gain nothing by

diplomacy-- going over to that       -- I, too, suggest you rethink

ship is a mistake.                   this strategy.

Sulu's hand goes up --

Bridge doors WHOOSH open -- they EXIT.

WE TRACK FAST with Pike, Kirk, Spock and Sulu as they HURRY

through the Enterprise toward the shuttle bay:

Kirk and Sulu share a HOLY FUCKING SHIT look --

What!?!                           -- Captain?

And with that, he's DONE. Strides off.     Kirk finally shakes off

the shock of his PROMOTION --

They appreciate the pure BALLS of that. BRAVERY washes over

them -- they'd fucking DIE for their Captain, who now turns to

Kirk and Sulu --

Sarek's hovercraft speeds along the desert floor, arriving at a

massive CAVE OPENING -- he and Amanda hurry off the craft --

into the cave --

QUICK CUTS: Kirk, Sulu, and the ship's LEAD ENGINEER OLSON are

suiting up for the drop, strapping on sleek AIRDROP ARMOR. WEB

BELTS. CHUTE PACKS. HARNESSES. HELMETS. COM-SETS.

They race into the shuttle and take seats facing each other

across a narrow aisle -- Red Shirt Engineer GRINS like he's

going on a ski trip:

Kirk nods at him -- subtext: "What a fucking sack."     He looks to

Sulu.

In the COCKPIT, Pike works the controls -- MOTORS WHINE and the

craft LURCHES --

We see the shuttle LEAVE THE DOCK --

The shuttle soars from the Enterprise bay, the planet Vulcan a

red orb below... THRUSTERS FLARE as it descends and now we

REVEAL AN INCREDIBLE SIGHT:

THE NARADA: FROM ITS BELLY, TENTACLE CABLES DESCEND TOWARD THE

PLANET'S OUTER ATMOSPHERE, WHERE THE PLASMA DRILL SUB-STATION IS

TETHERED: THE SOURCE OF THE DRILL BEAM SHOOTING INTO THE PLANET.

The shuttle GLIDES to a hover, 60,000 FEET ABOVE THE DRILL --

A KLAXON SOUNDS, signalling depressurization of the cargo lock --

the guys ready their equipment, snatching for handstraps,

standing on the lip of THE AIRLOCK -- Kirk and Sulu meet eyes

through their helmet faceplates, the point of no return --

PIKE'S VOICE over their headsets:

KIRK, SULU, AND RED SHIRT ARE SLAMMED HARD INTO THE ROOF OF THE

CARGO HOLD AS GRAVITY DIES.

Pike hits another control -- as the shuttle BOMB BAY DOORS OPEN -

- and KIRK, SULU, AND RED SHIRT ARE INSTANTLY PULLED OUT, INTO:

THE THREE MEN IN VIOLENT FREEFALL TOWARD THE PLANET -- IN WILD

SPIN -- THE SENSE OF SPEED'S BEYOND EXHILARATING --

ROCKETING THROUGH THE VOID AT 150 MPH AS THEY BREAK THROUGH THE

PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE -- SHAKING VIOLENTLY AT TERMINAL VELOCITY --

The falling trio TRACKED ON SCREEN, everyone watches, agape:

SPOCK and UHURA meet eyes -- this is fucking insane -- and a

MAN'S ENTHUSIASTIC YELLING takes us to:

ONE BY ONE THEY STABILIZE -- FALLING FACE DOWN -- STRAIGHT PAST

THE CABLE TENTACLES TETHERING THE DRILL TO THE NARADA WHICH GIVE

US A SENSE OF INCREDIBLE RELATIVE SPEED AND SCALE -- THESE

MASSIVE CABLES AT DIZZYING SPEED --

THEY ANGLE THEIR HANDS AND FEET FOR CONTROL, GUIDING THEMSELVES

TOWARD THE PLASMA DRILL -- SULU PULLS HIS CHUTE FIRST, THEN KIRK

-- their chutes SNAP OPEN -- JERKING THEM HARD UPWARD AS THE RED

SHIRT BLOWS PAST KIRK AND SULU --

HE DEPLOYS HIS CHUTE LAST -- 50 FT -- 40 -- 30 AND HIS CHUTE

BILLOWS OUT, OPENED TOO LATE -- OLSEN'S FUCKING BODY SLAMS INTO

THE EDGE OF THE CIRCULAR DRILL, BOUNCING OFF HARD STEEL AND

RIGHT INTO ITS CENTER WHERE THE SWIRLING VORTEX SPINS -- HE'S

INSTANTLY EVISCERATED IN THE PLASMA LIGHT!

Kirk approaches -- more terrified than ever -- he comes in hard,

too -- SLAMS against the drill edge, bounces but quickly gets

his footing -- hits a button on his chute and SLITS appear in

the fabric, suddenly there's no more drag and THE CHUTE AUTO-

RETRACTS into Kirk's pack -- A REUSABLE PARACHUTE.

BUT SULU ISN'T SO LUCKY: 20 yards from the drill surface his

chute gets SNARED IN THE CABLES, JERKING him upside down -- the

WIND is so intense Sulu is BLOWN SIDEWAYS -- his CHUTE LINES

begin RUBBING on the sharp metal of the suspension rig! Kirk

holds on to one of the chute's cables -- yells up:

As Kirk tries to climb up, Sulu's cables begin to SNAP! ONE BY

ONE -- and Sulu tries to CLIMB BACK using his chute cables,

toward the rig -- otherwise he's gonna fly off.

As Kirk makes his way up the rig, suddenly:

Kirk SPINS just as a Romulan appears -- tackling Kirk to the

drill platform! The two FIGHT PRECARIOUSLY ON THE EDGE OF THE

SWIRLING PLASMA DRILL, WIND ROARING -- and suddenly there's

ANOTHER ROMULAN from an OPEN HATCH! SULU SLIDES DOWN THE CABLE -

- JUMPING and tackling the second guard and the shit is ON: our

Starfleet heroes battling these Romulans to the death -- and

Sulu KICKS OFF AN ANTENNA PIECE and uses it as a SABER --

fucking swashbuckling at 10,000 feet! It's a frenzied assault

even the bigger Romulan isn't ready for, and Sulu manages to

KICK him into the vortex, where he's VAPORIZED as --

KIRK draws his PHASER and point-blank SHOOTS the Romulan,

knocking him clear OFF the cylinder and into the sky, falling to

his death, DISINTEGRATING as he falls --

Against pummeling wind, Kirk and Sulu move toward the HATCH --

OPEN IT -- as:

Pike's SHUTTLE DOOR OPENS. Pike steps out. Surrounded by a

dozen of Nero's men. Ayel steps forward. Pike stands firm,

knowing this is the end for him:

WHACK! He's cut off by a PUNCH to the face. Drops to his

knees. Looks up at Ayel with blazing eyes, wipes a trickle of

blood from his lip:

He's DRAGGED AWAY as --

Kirk and Sulu DROP IN through the outer hatch to find a control

console, Sulu madly flips switches, no luck --

Step back--                       -- what, you have an idea?

-- yeahyeah, I do--

Kirk FIRES his PHASER at the console, BLASTING IT --

The immense column of light DISAPPEARS, leaving only a towering,

swirling vortex of DIRT --

Uhura's console LIGHTS UP with activity:

Spock looks up from his console, grave --

A Romulan Helmsman RUNS to Nero --

Nero, mind racing --

The POD we saw earlier is FIRED from the ship -- it WHIPS past.

Kirk and Sulu pull themselves from the control cockpit back out

onto the drill's outer hull, they start to hear a SOUND... A

HIGH-PITCHED SHRIEK... GETTING LOUDER AS IT FALLS TOWARD THEM...

THEY LOOK UP JUST IN TIME TO SEE: THE RED MATTER POD RIP RIGHT

PAST THEM -- SNAP-TILT DOWN WITH IT AS IT PLUMMETS TOWARD

VULCAN'S SURFACE, DISAPPEARING INTO THE DRILLED GAPING HOLE --

And for an instant... nothing. What looks like a puff of smoke

billowing up from the planet's core... THEN A SHOCKWAVE BLASTS

UPWARD, ALL THE WAY UP TO THE DRILL AT 10,000 FEET -- KIRK AND

SULU FEEL IT -- LOSE THEIR BALANCE, FIGHT FOR PURCHASE AS:

SCENES OF DESTRUCTION ACROSS THE PLANET AS IT STARTS TO COME

APART: HUGE FISSURES FORM IN THE DESERT TERRAIN -- CRACKS SPREAD

-- MOUNTAINS CRUMBLE -- PLATES SHIFTING, LAVA SPEWING SKYWARD --

THE HEAT AND CONCUSSIVE BLAST SHAKE THE CAMERA TO A BLUR --

WARNING ALARMS SCREAM:

SPOCK'S STOIC FACE. WE GET ONLY A HINT OF THE WILD EMOTIONS

STIRRING INSIDE HIM -- Uhura watches Spock, heartsick for him:

She goes after him as he moves to the TURBOLIFT --

TURBOLIFT DOORS CLOSE AS --

HOLOGRAMS of VULCAN UNDER DESTRUCTION -- Nero watching them,

pleased. He turns to Ayel --

The drill platform LURCHES -- begins RETRACTING --

The platform BANKS -- Sulu FALLS BACK, OFF THE PLATFORM --

WITHOUT A CHUTE! Kirk, holding on, watching this wide-eyed --

and knowing what he must do, he RUNS AND JUMPS --

KIRK FALLS FAST, he's only gonna have one shot at this, presses

his arms to his sides and ROCKETS downward, building speed, four

hundred feet below is Sulu, FREEFALLING --

KIRK moves his feet and hands, angling toward him -- slashing

downward at 160 mph, closing like a missile -- the gap between

them narrows -- Sulu's 30 feet below him... 5000 feet to the

planet surface. 40 ft -- 20 -- 10 -- WHAM! Kirk slams into

Sulu in a mid-air tackle -- they TUMBLE TOGETHER -- Kirk's made

the grab and locked his arms around Sulu in an iron grip,

screams in his face:

Sulu DOES -- it opens -- but HOLY FUCK, the double weight RIPS

IT -- IT SNAPS AWAY FROM THEM -- NOW THEY'RE BOTH FREE-FALLING

WITH NO CHUTE, THE GROUND COMING AT THEM FAST!

The TRANSPORTER CHIEF works his controls, sweating -- trying to

LOCK ON TO THEIR MOVING TARGET --

SNAP AROUND as Chekov hears this -- watching his controls --

Uhura watching too --

Chekov suddenly BOLTS -- Uhura watches him race off -- a CREW

MEMBER steps into frame:

Chekov SPRINTS through CORRIDORS -- ENGINE ROOM -- YELLING:

And we take him to:

-- where he races to the controls, out of breath, yelling:

-- and he begins working the controls --

Kirk and Sulu SPEED-DROPPING -- TERRIFIED --

Chekov's manipulating a joystick-like TARGETING DISPLAY --

trying to match the CROSSHAIRS on the DROPPING FIGURES --

A massive SHEET OF LAVA, MILES HIGH, BURSTS INTO THE SKY -- Kirk

and Sulu enter frame, BULLET-WHOOSH right past us, DROPPING --

TIGHT ON CHEKOV as he struggles to lock onto them -- BEEP!

He HITS A BUTTON and --

5 FEET BEFORE THEY HIT THE GROUND, KIRK AND SULU DEMATERIALIZE!

AND REMATERIALIZE, SLAMMING DOWN ON THE TRANSPORTER PADS, HARD

AND PAINFUL, BUT SAFE! Transporter engineers GAPE in utter

amazement and relief -- Chekov, sweating, laughs. Kirk and Sulu

get their bearings, peeling themselves up, at stunned whispers:

And Kirk looks up as SPOCK hurries in --

As the console ENGINEER works the display --

And Spock DEMATERIALIZES --

PUSH IN as Spock MATERIALIZES -- the distant landscape around

him COLLAPSING, IMPLODING, EXPLODING -- he sprints for the

MOUNTAIN -- the entrance to the ARK -- a scared, small CREATURE

runs past Spock as he heads up the mountain -- rocks falling --

Spock RACES through the tunnels as the world SHAKES around him --

he enters the massive ARK CHAMBER -- sees, atop the enormous

stairs, FIVE VULCAN ELDERS, Sarek among them, hands placed on

the sarcophagus-like ark. Mind melding with it. Amanda is here

too, kneeling beside Sarek -- and she sees her son, who is now

RUNNING toward them -- she stands:

Spock rushes up the stairs --

And as they run out, ENORMOUS ROCKS COLLAPSE AROUND THEM -- and

they run through the tunnels, the STONE COLLAPSING AROUND THEM --

Spock and the group finally emerge from the tunnels to see --

THE PLANET IS COLLAPSING, COMING TOWARD THEM -- Spock whips

open a tri-corder, TREMBLING LIKE CRAZY --

Chekov works the controls:

HORROR AS THE WORLD LITERALLY STARTS TO FALL APART AROUND SPOCK,

HIS PARENTS AND THE FIVE ELDERS -- MASSIVE SINKHOLES APPEARING,

LIKE THE GRAND CANYON RACING FOR THEM -- AND WE SEE IN ALL THEIR

FACES -- THE BELIEF THAT THEIR PLANET -- THAT THEY -- ARE GOING

TO DIE -- and Spock, trying to hold it together -- even though

their transport hasn't yet begun -- looks at Amanda -- their

eyes lock -- THE COLLAPSING GROUND RACING TOWARD THEM -- and in

a surreal, intimate moment, Amanda says to Spock, quietly:

PUSH IN ON SPOCK, looking at her -- as the LIGHT DARTS start

TRACING THEM -- and they begin to EVAPORATE AS THE GROUND DROPS

FROM UNDER AMANDA -- AND SHE'S SUCKED DOWN -- AWAY -- as Spock

REACHES FOR HER, CALLING OUT --

Chekov in a panic at the controls --

-- as the Vulcans MATERIALIZE on the pad, Spock still REACHING

for his mother -- but all he gets it the GHOSTLY IMAGE OF HER --

BEAUTIFUL, HOLDING, FROZEN IN SPACE -- AN IMAGE HE'LL BE HAUNTED

BY FOREVER -- AS IT FADES AWAY, EVANESCING LIKE MIST -- ON SPOCK

as it lands -- Sarek too... a mother... a wife... has been lost.

And Kirk stands nearby, having observed all of this, without

anything to do or say... there's no cheating death.

And the Enterprise BLASTS AWAY -- in the distance, THE ENTIRE

PLANET OF VULCAN SWALLOWS INTO ITSELF -- A TERRIFYING,

UNIMAGINABLE IMPLOSION -- UNTIL NOTHING IS THERE BUT DARKNESS.

And over this we HEAR:

SHOCK. The kind that crashes after the world's changed. In

triage, the bay's filled with wounded Enterprise Officers. The

Vulcan Elders and Sarek being examined as well. Kirk sits here,

getting his hand bandaged from the fight. During this, he looks

up, seeing one of the Elders being treated for a slight wound --

her GREEN BLOOD seen through the bandage...

Spock sits in the captain's chair, reporting. He's glassy-eyed,

staring at nothing as he speaks. Behind him, Uhura sits,

watching, concerned.

Spock considers this. Clicks off the log recorder.     Spock moves

off, into the turbolift -- Uhura follows him --

Spock and Uhura. Silence hangs. She glances over, wanting to

say so much, but not to invade what must be the worst moment of

his life. He looks at her, with kind eyes. And Uhura does

something odd -- she STOPS the lift. Spock looks over as she

wordlessly reaches out and puts her arms around him. Just

holding him. Kissing his face with utter tenderness and

comfort, which he lets her do... and we realize, this is why the

intimacy before -- this is their secret...

Spock looks off, taking comfort, bewildered and lost...

He's on the verge of some emotional release... but self-

consciousness returns and he clamps up, starting the lift again:

He looks at her again -- gives her another kiss. The door opens

and he exits. She watches him go -- and the door closes on her.

Kirk comes down the hall, stretching his hand bandage -- when he

stops. Standing at the other end of the corridor, operating a

DATAPAD is a familiar-looking GREEN GIRL. Guilt overcomes him.

After a beat he moves to her. Awkward.

She just stares at him for a long beat, as if she's just pissed.

But Kirk's face changes... and then he says:

And he walks off.   (NOTE: ALT. VERSION HAS GAILA SAYING, "I'M

NOT GAILA.")

Uhura at her station, scanning for enemy signals -- all of our

principals are here, in debate:

They're all looking at Kirk like he's nuts.

Remaining power and crew are

being used to repair radiation

leaks on the lower decks and

damage to the main deflector

shield-- without which we

cannot communicate with          -- okay--okay, okayokayokay--

Starfleet.                       there's gotta be SOME WAY!

-- wait-- don't do that --

Spock -- running back to the

rest of the fleet for a confab

is a massive waste of time--        -- These were the orders

-- He also ordered us to go         Captain Pike issued when he

For a beat, nobody moves -- an impossible choice for all of

them. Torn, Chekov and Sulu close in on Kirk --

-- but Kirk SWINGS, Sulu jerks, FASTER, spins, GRABS Kirk's

wrist! Kirk ELBOWS him as Chekov reaches for his PHASER but

Kirk SLAMS HIM, the phaser DROPS -- Kirk reaches for it but

Spock's fingers CLAMP on Kirk's neck: THE VULCAN PINCH:

On PIKE'S FACE, strapped to a TABLE.    Nero looks down upon him.

Pike looks up at him -- quiet rage.   Then --

Curiosity behind Pike's eyes.

Pike just looks at him.   Sees how fucking far GONE he is.

And the "she" could refer to the planet... or to Nero's lost

love. Either way, Pike knows a losing battle when he's fighting

one. Ever so nobly, he quietly says --

Nero reaches for something under the counter Pike lies upon.

Retrieves A FAMILIAR GLASS CONTAINER -- inside -- DOZENS OF

CENTAURIAN SLUGS, the very ones used on Nero.

Nero opens the container, reaches for a pair of TONGS

Nero sad-smiles.   What he expected.

A ROMULAN GUARD HOLDS PIKE'S MOUTH -- Nero uses the tongs -- and

OFF PIKE'S EXPRESSION --

Our POV is BLURRY. We come into FOCUS on a blinking instrument

panel. KIRK is stirring awake, his shoulder kills. He sits up:

inside a ONE-MAN POD CRAFT. He WIPES THE GLASS -- looks up --

like a TUNNEL OF SNOW, 30 feet long, to the sky. THE PODCRAFT'S

EMBEDDED ON THE SURFACE OF A VAST, ICE PLANET. Kirk's been

MAROONED. He closes his eyes, his face falls...

The CANOPY RISES -- a blast of cold air hits Kirk -- with some

agony, out he goes -- he CLIMBS UP THE TUBE OF SNOW -- and gets

to the surface -- looks out. HE'S IN THE MIDDLE OF FUCKING

NOWHERE. Finally:

TRACKING along a massive ICE SHEET... Kirk ENTERS FRAME walking

along, cold, pissed... whips out a TRICORDER, speaks into it:

From overhead, what we see -- what Kirk doesn't -- is something

HUGE, SLITHERING UNDERWATER beneath the ice --

Kirk FREEZES at a nearby GROWL. He looks -- sees nothing --

then ANOTHER GROWL -- he turns -- some thirty feet away, an

eleven foot-tall cross between a polar bear and a gorilla (it's

a POLARILLA) steps out from behind a mass of ice. Sees Kirk.

It's horrifying. Kirk takes a SLOW, SMALL STEP BACKWARD -- and

the fucking thing CHARGES HIM -- KIRK RUNS, TERRIFIED -- and the

POLARILLA PURSUES -- gaining -- it's gonna EAT HIM ALIVE WHEN

SUDDENLY --

WHATEVER WAS BENEATH THE ICE EARLIER EXPLODES UP THROUGH IT --

IT'S NEARLY 30 FEET TALL, RED, HUNDREDS OF EYES -- IT SMACKS THE

POLARILLA AWAY LIKE NOTHING AS KIRK FALLS TO THE ICE AND TURNS

BACK -- HOLY SHIT! THIS THING IS SO MUCH WORSE! IT ROARS AS

KIRK GETS TO HIS FEET AND RUNS, SCREAMING --

KIRK HAULS ASS AS THE THING COMES AFTER HIM -- THEN SUDDENLY HE

FALLS -- DROPS -- and we see that Kirk is FALLING DOWN A MASSIVE

SNOW MOUNTAIN! The huge red creature stops at the edge and

ROARS LOUDLY -- until the ice shelf BREAKS AWAY! The creature

starts to FALL AS WELL! Now Kirk is TUMBLING, the immense

creature TUMBLING not far behind!

And Kirk LANDS ON THE ICE, HARD -- sees a distant CAVE. Looks

up at the FLAILING CREATURE that is about to CRUSH HIM -- Kirk

tries to run, but the ice is TOO SLIPPERY -- FINALLY he gets

footing and runs off toward the cave -- as the red creature

LANDS HARD -- its sharp SPEAR LIMBS STAB into the ice as it

pursues Kirk --

Kirk races through the darkened cave -- the creature comes

after him -- Kirk goes as fast as he can -- the creature reaches

out and fucking GRABS HIM -- pulls him toward the disgusting,

wet, TEETHY MOUTH -- Kirk tries to hold on to anything he can --

but he's fucking LUNCH -- and just as you're SCREAMING, there's

LIGHT -- FIRE LIGHT -- and a FIGURE APPEARS, WAVING A TORCH --

And the red creature's eyes ALL GO WILD -- and it DROPS KIRK and

BACKS OFF, AFRAID -- the figure CHASES IT until it's gone.

Kirk, on the ground, is freaked out, out of breath, and can't

take his eyes off this man... who says:

And the Figure turns... we may have recognized the voice.

IT'S SPOCK. As in NIMOY. HERE. Lit in the darkness by the

fire. We'll refer to him as SPOCK PRIME. He looks at Kirk --

moves closer to him -- finally seeing him. And is amazed...

Spock looks deep into the eyes of the freaked out young man,

feeling the full effect of fate playing its hand, but realizing

he doesn't recognize him...

Of all the things Spock predicted Kirk might say, it wasn't

that. He's analyzing a thousand steps ahead, calculating:

As Spock nods, we PRE-LAP:

Firelight flickers -- shadows of Kirk and Spock Prime dance on

the ice walls. Remarkable NIGHT STARS outside.

Spock Prime reaches for Kirk's face -- Kirk grabs his wrist --

A skeptical beat, but Kirk finally releases his hand. Spock

gently places his fingers on Kirk's cheek and temple --

Spock's eyes SNAP SHUT, Kirk JOLTS as if by an electric charge --

and the SCREEN OVEREXPOSES TO WHITE as we CUT TO our MIND MELD

SEQUENCE:

A SUPERNOVA. An EXPLODING STAR, like a LIGHT, EATING AWAY AT

ALL AROUND IT --

Now we're seeing VULCAN SCIENCE ACADEMY -- where SIX VULCAN

SCIENTISTS study a HOLOGRAM of this event -- the star's ORIGIN,

its PATH OF DESTRUCTION -- and SPOCK PRIME is among them --

PUSH IN as the JELLYFISH SHIP is under construction --

Now we're INSIDE the ship -- the CONTAINMENT HOLD -- being

ASSEMBLED by Vulcan Scientists --

Kamikaze pilot. Tea, sipped inside the Ark --

Now Spock Prime sits in the Jellyfish COCKPIT --

PRIME'S HAND AGAIN:

This annoys me, I don't like      -- I know, I know, I'm not

it-- do we have to do it like     surprised to hear you complain

this--?                           -- allow me to finish.

Spock Prime touches Kirk again and we go:

-- the JELLYFISH SWOOPS PAST US -- and we PAN -- and see the

MASSIVE SUPERNOVA in the infinite distance -- no sense of scale

here -- but then -- THE NARADA APPEARS -- FIRES TORPEDOES at the

Jellyfish.

Spock Prime LEAVES the cockpit --

Prime ENTERS AN AIRLOCK -- TUMBLES IN WEIGHTLESSNESS and enters

THE CONTAINMENT ROOM. QUICK CUTS as he REMOVES RED MATTER FROM

THE HOLD --

Spock loads the CANNISTER with a small amount of RED MATTER into

a JETTISON TUBE --

-- and he FIRES THE CANNISTER INTO SPACE --

Spock Prime back in the cockpit -- takes aim on his controls and

FIRES AT THE CANNISTER --

A BLACK HOLE IS CREATED -- Spock Prime PILOTS TOWARD THE HOLE --

The NARADA and the JELLYFISH aiming for the BLACK HOLE --

Spock Prime watches as the NARADA GOES IN -- LIGHTNING STORM-

STYLE DISAPPEARING FIRST -- then SPOCK PRIME'S FACE -- WHITE

WITH LIGHTNING -- OVEREXPOSED --

LIGHT on Spock Prime's face goes away -- he and the Jellyfish

are back in SPACE --

-- but now, facing him, is the NARADA.

KIRK INHALES, SHARPLY, having been there with Spock Prime.    Back

to the two men, in a cave:

Kirk stares at him... his mind spinning because now he

believes him. The result is overwhelmingly emotional.

Kirk gathers himself, wipes his eyes on his sleeve...

But Kirk stands -- stops him:

This is amazing for Kirk -- he looks off, trying to imagine that

life. Spock intuits what this means.

The Enterprise STREAKS through frame in a warp blur --

Sulu at his controls:

The turbolift opens -- McCoy enters, moves to Spock:

We're not sure how McCoy is taking this...

A strong look and Spock turns away as Sarek enters the bridge.

Spock moves to meet him. Off McCoy, fuming --

A fucking BLIZZARD.   Kirk and Spock Prime move through the

maddening whiteout.   Kirk yells through it:

And Spock POINTS -- an OUTPOST -- half a mile away.

Long tile corridor. The door at the end opens -- SNOW AND WIND

as Kirk and Spock Prime enter. Door closes. Silence again.

Echo. Nothing. They head down. After a beat, a SMALL, DARK,

ODDLY ALIEN CREATURE STEPS OUT. Eyes them curiously. This is

KEENSER.

Keenser looks them over.    Then:

And they follow Keenser into a MASSIVE WAREHOUSE, filled mostly

with junked space parts. A large, tarped SHUTTLE in the

background. In the middle of the huge, depressing space is a

table. And a STARFLEET OFFICER who is ASLEEP, legs kicked up,

leaning back in a chair, a hat covering his face. Keenser taps

the Officer's boot.

A beat -- and the Officer peers from under his hat.     A cool,

slow burn.

Officer stands, unhappy about something. Keeser watches nearby --

Kirk reacts. Scotty reacts -- is almost spooked -- sobers up a

bit... really regards Spock Prime. Skeptical. Amused.

Off Scotty, who can't help but be intrigued --

Scotty PULLS A TARP over much of the out-of-service shuttle.

Spock finishes speed-typing the FIELD EQUATIONS on the

TRANSPORTER CONTROL PANEL -- amazingly fast.

Spock Prime steps aside:

Scotty looks at the equations -- we watch his expression run the

gamut: from confused, to dumbfounded, to quiet awe and delight:

As Spock works the keyboard, an ENTERPRISE SCHEMATIC rotates:

Your destiny can wait -- he         (simply, strong)

won't believe me, only you can   Under no circumstances can he

explain w--                      be made aware of my existence.

PUSHING IN ON KIRK as this lands for him --

Scotty's on the pad.   Kirk follows, looks at Spock:

Something strikes Kirk -- his eyes GLINT with revelation. Spock

responds enigmatically: a silent acknowledgment of what Kirk

must do to get the ship. He raises his hand in the legendary

Vulcan salute:

And Spock activates the transporter and they DEMATERIALIZE --

the light plays off his face as he watches them vanish --

The Enterprise SHOOTS THROUGH FRAME at warp --

Amid the ROAR of the ship's plasma drives, PARTICLES

rematerialize... it's KIRK, eyes wide in suspense. He looks

down at his legs, his chest, his arms to make sure he's still in

one piece, glances over to share his relief with Scotty... BUT

SCOTTY ISN'T THERE. A strange BANGING -- Kirk turns: the

BANGING is coming from a large metal TANK -- then Scotty appears

in a TRANSLUCENT PIPE -- FREAKING OUT -- BANGING ON THE CLEAR

METAL -- Kirk's mind races -- he looks around for a way to save

his new friend -- just then a STRONG CURRENT IS FELT inside the

tube -- AND SCOTTY IS YANKED AWAY, DOWN THE TUBE!

And Kirk runs after him -- down the length of the ORANGE,

TWISTING and TURNING tubes -- SCOTTY SEEN every time he enters a

CLEAR TUBE AREA -- then DISAPPEARING again into the ORANGE tubes

-- and Scotty gets sucked UPWARDS -- and Kirk turns and looks --

FOLLOWS THE LENGTH OF TUBE -- SEEING WHERE IT'S HEADING -- TO A

GIANT WATER TURBINE -- essentially? A MASSIVE FUCKING BLENDER.

And Kirk HAULS ASS to the control panel -- we see the huge

machine -- overhead, the RELEASE VALVE under the pipe -- and

Kirk works as fast as he can --

-- but the COMPUTER SAYS:

A display on the forward console, an ALARM FLASHES --

Spock moves from Sarek to Chekov --

Chekov brings up TWO DOZEN SECURITY VIDEO IMAGES ON ONE SCREEN.

Spock points to one -- it ENLARGES -- and we see KIRK AND SCOTTY

racing through the ship -- Spock's eyes narrow -- he moves to

the Captain's chair -- hits comm:

INSIDE THE TUBE, SCOTTY TUMBLES, YELLING UNDERWATER as --

Kirk, AT THE PANEL, accesses the RELEASE VALVE CONTROL -- he

watches Scotty disappear through a CLEAR SECTION -- Kirk times

it -- waiting -- then he HITS THE BUTTON and Scotty DROPS

THROUGH THE RELEASE VALVE AND SLAMS TO THE FLOOR -- hurt, wet,

but BREATHING, deeply --

Kirk and wet Scotty race through the ship -- only to finally

turn a corner and be faced with PHASERS, AIMED RIGHT AT THEM.

But suddenly PHASERS are at their heads. Two SECURITY GUARDS --

one, THE GUY HE GOT INTO THE FIGHT WITH AT THE BAR, YEARS AGO.

Off Kirk -- shit --

WOOSH -- bridge doors open -- Kirk and Scotty are ushered in by

the Security Guards. Spock moves to them, containing his anger

and dismay. McCoy is here as well. Spock walks right up to

Kirk... raises his eyebrow.

Kirk stares at the young Spock -- a different experience now --

HUH.   That confounds Spock.   And Kirk is off to the races --

Spock again focuses on Scotty --

ON SCOTTY.   Weighing all this.     Then --

Spock nods back to the SECURITY GUARDS, over this --

But before the guards can do so --

Kirk gets close to Spock --

Sarek watches, tense.   McCoy, too.   Spock blinks --

-- WHAM! SPOCK HAS JUST HIT KIRK -- and Kirk goes to hit back,

but Spock fucking DELIVERS A SERIES OF POWERFUL BLOWS --

Security stand back as the Captain attacks...

And Spock is now fucking CHOKING Kirk -- HE SLAMS KIRK AGAINST

THE WALL -- SPOCK'S CHOKING THE LIFE OUT OF HIM --

And everything -- everything -- STOPS. Spock, red-faced,

releases his grip. Kirk GULPS air and tumbles to the ground.

Spock staggers back. Kirk's hardly able to speak, close to

collapsing. But despite his brutalized face, his expression

isn't about spite, or hatred... but compassion.

Spock sees the faces of the STUNNED CREW staring at him. But

worst of all? Sarek. His father. Spock levels his chin.

Quickly wipes his eyes. Trying to regain some semblance of

dignity... looks to McCoy. Softly --

JESUS. Spock just... QUIT. And after a beat, he leaves the

room. Sarek follows a moment later.

The crew just stands there in stunned SILENCE.   Finally --

McCoy turns to Kirk, exasperated --

ON KIRK.   The moment is upon him.

ON MCCOY. The CREW -- confused. Sulu just fucking POINTS at

Kirk and they all realize HOLY SHIT -- Pike made KIRK the First

Officer before he left!

And Kirk moves to the captain's chair, passing Uhura:

TRACKING WITH SPOCK, hearing the announcement as he walks

stoically -- past CREW, hearing this --

On KIRK as he ends the announcement:

Clicks off.    PUSH IN ON KIRK, staring off --

He looks up.    Uhura is there.   Pissed off:

SPOCK stand here, staring at the place where his mother should

have, but didn't, arrive. Sarek enters. Sees his son. They're

alone for the first time in ages. A beat:

Watch Spock's face.   Struggling with what's pent-up inside...

Spock looks at Sarek.   This is as close to emotion as he'll get.

Their look HOLDS -- and for Spock, a revelation...

-- the strategy session continues in FULL SWING -- now Chekov,

the youngest of the bunch, gets up the courage to chime in,

incidently becoming the very first officer to say:

All eyes shift to the wonder-kid who awaits permission to speak:

Everyone turns, surprised: SPOCK has entered the bay --

galvanized, full of purpose --

The crew looks at this very courageous Vulcan with deep respect -

- but his focus is on Uhura, whose eyes smile back at him.

And a MOMENT -- a burgeoning friendship --

PANNING ACROSS AN ALIEN LANDSCAPE... and even though it's in

shadow, you start to recognize it as THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON.

OUR POV ascends now to see:

THE ENTERPRISE DROPS OUT OF WARP IN THE DEAD SILENCE OF SPACE...

And we move past it, along the orbit of the moon, cresting the

horizon to see EARTH -- AND NERO'S SHIP HOVERING ABOVE IT.

CLOSE ON NERO -- his face illuminated on the DARKENED BRIDGE of

the Narada by SOFT BLUE LIGHT. Light radiated by EARTH. A

BEAUTIFUL HOLOGRAM before him. He doesn't notice behind him, as

those BLADES from his STAFF APPEAR BEHIND HIS NECK. Nero

tenses, only now sensing this unforeseen danger: AYEL HOLDS THE

WEAPON. Strong. Tough. But under it all... terrified.

Nero turns slowly and deliberately -- Ayel tenses:

Nero now faces Ayel, blades at his throat -- Ayel growing more

nervous as he faces his master. The surrounding crew stare on,

frozen in the moment, only slightly confirming their makeshift

mutiny with scared looks.

Nero considers this... nods gently.

Ayel is massively relieved.     Nero gently reaches out, holds the

staff (still aimed at him).     He deactivates it -- the blades

instantly RETRACT.

And just as Ayel realizes he's fucked, Nero somehow activates

the staff in a way we have not seen -- AND THE BLADES APPEAR ON

THE OTHER END -- THE END NOW FACING AYEL -- AND JUST AS AYEL'S

EYES GO WIDE -- NERO THRUSTS THE BLADES INTO AYEL -- WHO FALLS

TO THE FLOOR, DEAD! Nero's hard face turns to the rest of his

crew.

ON THE FACES OF THE MEN, SUBMITTING TO HIS WILL, our MUSIC

BUILDING -- and then, his eyes on Earth like a fucking LION eyes

a gazelle--

THE DRILL BAY DOORS open as they LOWER THE PLASMA DRILL.

No sign of Kirk and Spock.     Sulu's in the captain's chair.

Chekov at helm.

The impulse engines SURGE, shutting off as the ship slips out

from behind the moon and into open space --

Sulu makes rapid-fire thruster combinations to stay on track --

a stealthy ballet of incredible dexterity. THE NARADA appears

over the horizon in geosynchronous orbit, passing underneath the

Enterprise as they arc in behind it.

The small Enterprise pulls into position behind the massive

Narada's BLIND SPOT and comes to a gentle stop. Tension --

KIRK and SPOCK ready themselves for transport. STRAP ON UTILITY

BELTS: COM-SETS, TRICORDERS, and of course, PHASERS --

Spock turns to Uhura, who hands him a small TRANSLATOR DEVICE:

Uhura gives the translator to Spock -- AND HE KISSES UHURA.

They part, revealing KIRK'S SHOCKED FACE. Uhura walks off,

leaving the two men -- Kirk looking stunned at Spock.

Kirk still stunned as Scotty moves to transporter control.

KIRK AND SPOCK STAND ON THE TRANSPORTER PAD, SIDE-BY-SIDE AND

FACING THE SAME DIRECTION FOR THE FIRST TIME -- AN ICONIC IMAGE -

- The moment of truth.

Scotty hits the transport and Kirk and Spock DISAPPEAR --

Kirk and Spock MATERIALIZE in the cargo bay... to find

themselves suddenly smack-dab in the middle of SIX ROMULAN

GUARDS working at cargo consoles!!

For a split second they're as shocked as Kirk and Spock, until

they ATTACK -- Kirk immediately engages the closest Romulan,

struggles -- but Spock's a machine: his palm snaps up CRACKING a

nose -- SLAMS a head against the wall -- as battle-ready as the

Romulans are, it's like trying to catch a GHOST, Kirk finally

knocks his one opponent unconscious, and turns to see it's ALL

OVER --

Kirk and Spock move to a still conscious Romulan as he struggles

to get up. Spock reaches for the fallen Romulan's temples.

-- punch him in the face --

make him talk! Suus Mahna his       -- Suss Mahna is only intended

ass!                                for self-defense, he's no

-- then pretend it's a threat -

- I'm your captain, that's an

order!

Spock PUNCHES the Romulan HARD -- and via Uhura's comlink

translator, speaks in SUBTITLED ROMULAN:

The guard SPITS green blood at Spock, who PUNCHES him again --

THE ENERGY TORNADO FIRES FROM THE DRILL INTO THE EARTH!

The plasma beam SLAMS INTO SAN FRANCISCO BAY -- massive

CONCUSSION CLOUDS FORM AROUND THE BEAM --

Cadets RUN to see the horrific sight of the plasma beam --

As Uhura returns to the bridge, everyone's stations go DARK --

STATIC on screens --

A ROTATING SHIP SCHEMATIC -- Spock typing at a console,

searching -- accesses two inter-cam windows: on one, SPOCK

PRIME'S SHIP, THE JELLYFISH -- in a lower containment hold -- on

the other: PIKE, unclear if he's dead or alive.

They cover each other with phasers as they move down the hall --

Captain Pike's shuttle and the Jellyfish sit parked among the

equipment. Kirk and Spock stealthily board the Jellyfish --

Kirk hits a console, a familiar voice comes to life:

THE LASER GRID RESPONDS TO SPOCK'S VOICE, scans his features for

ID -- THE HOLOGRAPHIC DISPLAY MATERIALIZES:

He looks to Kirk in surprise -- Spock's eyes fix with sudden

understanding. Ambassador Spock... of course... suddenly all

the pieces start coming together...

Spock looks at Kirk, a touch upset:

Spock weigh his options.     Trust.   Finally:

Kirk exits --

Kirk moves through various areas of the ship --

Spock works the control -- fires up the craft --

LIGHTS COME ON -- he starts it up -- the ship begins to RISE --

and with the enormous JELLYFISH now OPERATING -- FLOATING IN THE

HANGAR, Spock turns the ship and FIRES AT THE MASSIVE IRIS DOOR,

BLOWING IT OPEN! DEBRIS AND LOOSE OBJECTS GET SUCKED INTO SPACE

as --

The ship SHUDDERS from within -- ALARMS --

CLOSE -- NERO -- EYES WILD, REALIZING THEY HAVE A SABOTEUR:

THE JELLYFISH FLIES OUT -- ANGLES TOWARD THE DRILL AND FIRES

ANOTHER TORPEDO -- DIRECT HIT!

THE MASSIVE RIG SWINGS -- THE TETHERS SNAPSNAPSNAP -- THE DRILL

TILTS AND ROCKETS LOOSE, PLUMMETING DOWN... DOWN... DOWN...

As the bridge crew fights to regain control:

A beat -- the Romulan Commander looks up from his console:

OFF Nero's fucking mega rage --

The Narada turns -- accelerates in pursuit of the Jellyfish and

AWAY FROM EARTH -- and now we're back to the imagery of the

first few moments of the movie -- THE NARADA GAINING ON THE

JELLYFISH, SPOCK AT THE CONTROLS --

SPOCK STARES WITH DEADLY FOCUS AT THE VIEWSCREEN:

And Nero?   Just grins in perfect contentment...

Nero hurries to the controls -- operates them himself and --

-- FIRE IT DOES -- TORPEDOES BLAST FROM THE HOLD and to the

jellyfish, which performs evasive maneuvers -- the torpedoes

EXPLODE as --

Kirk moves through shadow into an airlock shaft, starts climbing

ladder rungs --

The JELLYFISH TILTS, earth receding far behind it -- Spock veers

to avoid being blown apart -- Nero's ship gaining -- firing --

Kirk moves through the space -- into the TORTURE ROOM, where he

finds PIKE, CLOSE TO DEATH -- Kirk begins unfastening his binds.

Pike sees him through his fog -- amazed --

Kirk helps LIFT HIM -- but what he DOESN'T SEE are the FOUR

GUARDS entering with weapons --

But PIKE, God bless him, does: summoning his last ounce of

strength, he manages to UNHOLSTER KIRK'S PHASER AND BLASTS THE

FOUR GUARDS OUT OF EXISTENCE! Safe, he SLUMPS, dropping the

phaser --

The Narada FIRES again, TEARING a gash in the Jellyfish's side.

An array EXPLODES --

On Spock -- bad as things are, they just got worse -- his mind

SPINS until:

And the Jellyfish TURNS -- a new course RIGHT FOR THE NARADA --

CLOSE ON SPOCK, bravely facing certain death -- on a collision

course with the Narada -- looks like he's gonna sacrifice

himself -- and we assume he'll pull away at the last second, of

course he will, but he DOESN'T:

SMASH! THE JELLYFISH EXPLODES, SPOCK SEEMINGLY KILLED -- AND IN

THE BLAST, THE RED MATTER IGNITES! A MASSIVE BLACK HOLE STARTS

TO FORM, THE BIGGEST ONE YET! STARS DRIFT TOWARD ITS CENTER,

PULLED INTO THE SPHERE BY THE GRAVITY WELL AS IT STARTS TO

EXPAND --

As the ship's ROCKED HARD, Nero sees the black hole BUILDING

through the cockpit window:

EVERYTHING'S GETTING SUCKED INTO THE EVER-EXPANDING BLACK HOLE --

A MASSIVE PULSE OF ENERGY PUMMELS NERO'S SHIP, SHEARING THROUGH

ITS HULL -- AS THE NARADA TRIES TO REVERSE OUT OF THE GRAVITY

WELL, THE ENTERPRISE IS REVEALED BEHIND IT -- HAVING BEEN THERE

THE WHOLE TIME --

IT'S A RUSH, CRAZY, TENSE AS HELL --Uhura, McCoy, a MED TEAM and

ND OFFICERS race in as Scotty finishes receiving incoming

signals:

KIRK, SPOCK... AND PIKE MATERIALIZE ON THE PAD:

Kirk transfers Pike to McCoy, who urgently SCANS Pike and barks

to a MED-TECH:

Everyone's HURLED off their feet -- consoles fry -- FIRE --

Nero's eyes come UNHINGED --

WHOOSH: KIRK and SPOCK race back onto the bridge --

NERO appears on screen from the Narada bridge -- the Narada's on

its last legs -- a beat before Nero TURNS, realizing Kirk's

fucking GRINNING at him from the screen:

THE ENTERPRISE ARCS AROUND, FIRING A FULL SALVO AT THE NARADA --

AND THE HITS CONNECT, A DOMINO-EFFECT OF EXPLOSIONS RIPPLING

ACROSS THE ALREADY WEAKENED SHIP -- IT STARTS NOSE-DIVING,

TOWARD THE BLACK HOLE --

The walls are RIPPING AWAY, PYLONS pull free from their

moorings, into the ever-expanding sphere -- NERO -- IN THE

CHAOS, KNOWING HE'S REACHED THE END, CLOSES HIS EYES:

AND THE NARADA IMPLODES, BUCKLING IN ON ITSELF, DISAPPEARING IN

PIECES INTO THE BLACK VORTEX --

Leaving only the Enterprise -- its nacelles FLARE as the ship

tries to make the quantum leap -- BUT: the black hole's now a

TITANIC WHIRLPOOL so insanely strong that the Enterprise is held

in place by the gravity well even at warp! IT SHAKES INTO A

BLUR, trying to cut loose but it CAN'T --

Scotty SHOUTS BACK into the com against the SCREAMING DRIVE:

Scotty SLAMS the activation panel and we see the WARP CORE eject

down a tube, like an INSTANT PNEUMATIC RELEASE --

THE WARP CORE TUBE LAUNCHES FROM THE ENTERPRISE, STREAKING RIGHT

INTO THE MOUTH OF THE BLACK HOLE -- AN INSANE, SILENT EXPLOSION:

THE BLACK HOLE LIGHTS UP FROM HORIZON TO HORIZON, THE BLAST WAVE

WHITING OUT THE FRAME! THE ENTERPRISE IS CONSUMED WITHIN IT:

FOR A MINUTE, WE THINK IT'S GONE... UNTIL IT'S JETTISONED OUT

INTO THE STARS, FLYING AWAY, LEAVING THE FIRESTORM BEHIND IT!

Everyone white-knuckles their seats as the blast DISSIPATES...

and our crew sits, wide-eyed, trembling... finally, truly safe.

Back home.

Spock is seen in a medical office with Pike, who lies in bed,

recovering -- McCoy monitors him - Spock exits -- walks through

the corridor -- sees a VULCAN in silhouette, staring out at the

Academy. Sarek. Spock moves to him -- says quietly:

Sarek turns -- but IT ISN'T SAREK.   IT'S SPOCK PRIME.     Who says:

An incredible beat, our two Spocks in eye lock... both minds

processing conversational possibilities at an incredible rate...

surreal extensions of each other, separate but connected...

Young Spock's eyes flicker in puzzlement...

There is, to young Spock's surprise, vulnerability in that.

Young Spock considers an enduring friendship between him and

Kirk... for the first time, understanding it. But --

Young Spock takes that in, resolute...

Spock Prime moves to the door, stops.    Offers the VULCAN SALUTE:

Their eyes hold. Spock turns, disappearing into the corridor.

Young Spock stares at the empty doorway a beat, his mind a

jumble of thoughts... and our MUSIC BUILDS...

As Spock Prime walks off down the corridor, he passes right by a

man conferring with a nurse -- the man pauses, turns... it's

SAREK. Suddenly overcome by a feeling that the stranger who's

just passed him is... oddly familiar.

MUSIC STILL BUILDING -- glass walls reveal THE ENTERPRISE at

dock, UTILITY CRAFTS floating around it, repairing. Standing at

attention in rows, THE ENTERPRISE CREW -- over four hundred of

them wearing DRESS UNIFORMS -- TRACK DOWN the faces, all proud --

and we STOP ON YOUNG KIRK. Composed, focused, a man. The

ACADEMY PRESIDENT stands at a podium:

Kirk breaks from formation, pivots, marches down the hangar --

past UHURA... SULU... CHEKOV... SCOTTY. All Beaming. Notably

absent, is Spock. Kirk ascends the stairs, snaps to attention:

He opens a BOX -- glorious in repose, a MEDAL:

Kirk turns. Walks to... PIKE. In a wheelchair now, wearing an

ADMIRAL'S UNIFORM. Overnight, his hair's turned totally grey --

but despite his trauma, his pride's overwhelming. They SALUTE:

Pike containing a smirk, pins the medal to Kirk's chest.

Kirk turns to the crowd. Eyes shining. WILD APPLAUSE. As Kirk

rejoins his crew for hugs and congratulations, we go to the BACK

of the hangar... SPOCK PRIME. Watching. Moved beyond words.

He turns and leaves them to it... and our MUSIC SWELLS as --

The turbolift WHOOSHES open and in walks Kirk -- to every fan's

delight, wearing his iconic GOLD SHIRT. All around him, our

crew -- young and fresh-faced but no longer children -- in

charge of the greatest starship ever built:

And Kirk pauses. His eyes go over to the empty science console

with a sense of incompleteness. In fact, everyone on the bridge

feels it. A bitter truth they'll have to accept.

WHOOSH: the turbolift door opens.      SPOCK!!!   Wearing his BLUE

UNIFORM. Our hearts soar --

Kirk nearly laughs. Spock's eyebrow goes up. Something passes

between them... it carries acceptance, and trust...

As the ship maneuvers out of dry dock, Spock takes his place

next to Kirk. Gold and blue, side by side.

And the ship crests the drydock portal, drifting into space...

blessed one last time by the voice of our Vulcan hero:

The TREK THEME SOARS as the Enterprise warps off into a universe

of infinite possibilities...

THE FOLLOWING DIALOGUE TO BE ASSIGNED TO MAIN OR ADDITIONAL

BRIDGE CREW IF TIME AND CASTING PERMITS.

INT. KELVIN BRIDGE

Crew members are glued to their telemetry, working consoles:

Suddenly, a WARNING BEEP --

Sir, I have a reading --

they've locked weapons on us!     -- Red alert!   Arm weapons!

ALARMS BLARE -- LIGHTS GO RED as --
