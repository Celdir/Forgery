A 1930's NEWSREEL.

The mysterious SOUTH AMERICAN JUNGLE. A massive waterfall

cascades down a gigantic, flat-topped mountain.

A painted portrait of a dashing young adventurer.

A massive DIRIGIBLE descends on an airfield.

INT. MOVIE THEATRE - CONTINUOUS

Of everyone watching in the modest, small town theater, no

one is more enthralled than 8 year old CARL FREDRICKSEN.

Young Carl stares, mouth agape, wearing leather flight helmet

and goggles -- just like his idol on the silver screen.

NEWSREEL FOOTAGE: the dashing Muntz descends down the

gangplank to the delight of the crowd. His dogs trail him.

An opulent dining room.

One dog runs suffers through mechanized bath time, while a

second wears an electrode helmet and runs on a treadmill.

Cameras flash as Muntz stands heroic, striking his signature

"thumbs up" stance.

In the theater, Young Carl returns the thumbs up.

Muntz speaks to a crowded auditorium, on stage beside a

curtained object.

He pulls away the drape to reveal a GIANT BIRD SKELETON.

Young Carl leans forward, eyes bulging.

Skeptical scientists analyze the bones.

Muntz's portrait is removed from a wall of paintings of other

famous explorers.

Muntz's "Explorer's Society" badge is ceremoniously RIPPED

from his jacket.

Carl GASPS.

Muntz stands next to his dirigible at an airfield.       He grimly

addresses the crowd.

In the theater, young Carl smiles.

The crowd CHEERS.

Muntz gives his thumbs up from the cockpit as the dirigible

lifts off.

Carl looks like he just witnessed a miracle.

EXT. SMALL TOWN NEIGHBORHOOD, 1930'S - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Young Carl "flies" his blue balloon ("The Spirit of

Adventure" hand-written on it) as he runs along the sidewalk.

He still wears helmet and goggles.

TITLE CARD: WALT DISNEY PICTURES PRESENTS

TITLE CARD: A PIXAR ANIMATION STUDIOS FILM

Carl jumps over a small rock.

Carl jumps over a crack in the sidewalk.

Carl jumps over a tree stump... and smacks into it instead.

TITLE CARD:   UP

Carl stops.   Who said that?

The voice comes from a dilapidated HOUSE, windows boarded up

and lawn overgrown with weeds.

The weather vane atop the house turns, pulled by ropes.

Carl walks toward the voice.

INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Carl squeezes through the broken door into the foyer.   He

follows the voice toward the living room.

INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Carl rounds the corner to see...

ELLIE, an eight year old girl, her mussy red hair barely

visible beneath her flight helmet and goggles. Bare footed,

her overalls are patched and dirty.

The old house has been transformed into a make-believe

dirigible cockpit. Ellie steers, the wheel made from a rusty

old bicycle.

The navigator (her hamster) skitters in its cage.

Ellie uses two tied-together Coke bottles as binoculars.

Carl is distracted by the Muntz newspaper clippings taped to

the wall.

Ellie pops up in front of Carl.

Carl screams. He lets go of his balloon. It floats through

a broken part of the ceiling and disappears.

Ellie circles Carl accusingly.

Carl FUMPHERS.

She offers her hand.   Carl looks down, embarrassed.

Carl is frozen.   Ellie softens.

She takes off her helmet.   Her hair frizzes out in all

directions.

She removes a homemade GRAPE SODA CAP pin from her shirt and

pins it on Carl.

Carl smiles.

Carl watches her stride out of the room.   She pops back in.

She grabs his hand.

Carl blushes as she pulls him out of the room.

INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE, UPSTAIRS

Carl and Ellie look across the attic at the balloon. Between

them the floor has collapsed, save one rickety beam. Carl GULPS.

She pushes him out onto the beam.

Carl steels his courage. He puts on his goggles, starts

forward... and FALLS through the floor.

EXT. SMALL TOWN NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - DAY

Ambulance.    SIREN blaring.

EXT. CARL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

One lone light on upstairs.

INT. CARL'S ROOM

Carl in bed, reading a book by flashlight, his arm in a CAST.

Into the room floats Carl's lost BLUE BALLOON.

Carl jumps and CALLS OUT in fright.

A head pops up from outside the open window.

Carl SCREAMS, hitting himself in the face with the cast.

Ellie climbs in the window.

INT. CARL'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

The two hunker under a blanket tent with a flashlight.   Ellie

whispers, as if to protect a National Secret.

Carl's eyes widen in alarm.

Carl nods.

Carl crosses.    Ellie unveils...

It's a reused photo album with the words "My Adventure Book"

written across it. She opens it to a photo of Charles Muntz.

Carl smiles excitedly.

She turns the page to a map.

She turns to an engraving of a large waterfall. A small hand-

drawn picture of Ellie's clubhouse is glued to the top.

Carl GASPS in horror.

She flips through her book, revealing a page marked, "STUFF

I'M GOING TO DO." Past that, the pages are blank.

Ellie closes the book, disappointed.

Carl has a thought.    He looks at his toy dirigible.

Carl does.

Carl shakes his head "no."

Ellie hops up and jumps out the window.

She pops back in.

Carl looks out the window after her in amazement.   He rests

his head on his balloon.

The balloon pops.

INT. CHURCH - DAY

FLASH! A photo is taken of the wedding couple: Carl and

Ellie, now 19. She jumps at him and gives him a big kiss.

Ellie's side of the church erupts like wild frontiersmen.     A

gun shot is fired in the air.

Carl's side, rigid puritans in black, clap politely.

EXT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE - DAY

Carl carries her past a "SOLD" sign.   It's the same house

where they met as kids.

EXT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE - DAY

Still in their wedding clothes: She saws as he hammers.

INT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY

They push two chairs into place side by side in the living room.

EXT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE - DAY

as well. They smile.

EXT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE - DAY

Their house now matches Ellie's colorful CLUB HOUSE DRAWING

from her childhood Adventure Book.

EXT. RURAL HILLSIDE - DAY

They run up a hillside together.

They lie side by side on a picnic blanket. She describes the

Carl closes his eyes and smiles.   He's lucky to be with her.

EXT. ZOO - DAY

Ellie emerges from the South America House, dressed in her

Zookeeper's uniform.

Carl shows off his new BALLOON CART and uniform. Behind him

the balloons lift his cart off the ground. Carl jumps to

catch it. She giggles.

INT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY

Carl and Ellie sit side by side in their chairs, reading.

Without looking up from their books, they hold hands.

EXT. RURAL HILLSIDE - DAY

Again at their picnic spot, they watch clouds. Ellie sees an

elephant with wings. Carl gives it a try and points out a

BABY. Ellie lights up, excited. She sees ALL the clouds as

babies! Carl is stunned... but smiles.

native bird figurine beneath the painting. It's their shrine

to Adventure.

INT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

Carl sets A JAR on a table, "PARADISE FALLS" written on it.

Ellie drops in a few coins. She looks at Carl and crosses

her heart. Carl crosses his.

A SERIES OF SHOTS

The jar slowly fills as Carl and Ellie toss in spare change.

Their car blows a tire.

The two stand by the jar, reluctant.   Carl BREAKS the jar.

New tire.

Carl in the hospital with a broken leg.

Breaking jar.

A storm rages.   A tree falls, crushing the roof.

Breaking jar.

Carl struggles to tie his tie.   Ellie helps.   They walk out

the front door arm in arm.

INT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, FRONT HALL - 3 YEARS LATER

Ellie struggles to tie Carl's tie as they rush out the door.

A SERIES OF SHOTS as Ellie straightens Carl's ties.    Stylish

1950's ties. Wide 60's ties. Paisley 70's ties.

INT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, FRONT HALL - 30 YEARS LATER

Older Carl and Ellie smile at themselves in the hall mirror.

EXT. ZOO - DAY

Carl in his 60's. They still work happily side by side at

the zoo. Carl's cart lifts off the ground. He casually

leans an elbow on it.

INT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Carl and Ellie dance in the evening candlelight. The

PARADISE FALLS JAR sits off to the side, now dusty and

forgotten.

INT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM WINDOW - AFTERNOON

Carl cleans the inside of the window.    Ellie cleans the

outside.

INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

Carl vacuums the Adventure Shrine on the mantle. Carl smiles

at a photo of Ellie as a child, wearing her flight helmet and

goggles. He looks up at the mural of their house at Paradise

Falls. His smile fades.

Behind him, Ellie sweeps the floor.    Their dream has gone

unfulfilled.

Carl has an idea.

EXT. TRAVEL AGENCY - DAY

Carl buys two tickets to South America.

EXT. RURAL HILLSIDE - AFTERNOON

Carl hurries excitedly up picnic hill.    He hides the airline

tickets in his basket.

falls again. Something is wrong.

He runs to her.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Ellie lies in a hospital bed.    She looks through her

ADVENTURE BOOK.

A BLUE BALLOON floats in to the room.

He kisses her on the forehead.

Carl sits alone, next to a huge bouquet of balloons.

EXT. CARL AND ELLIE'S HOUSE - DUSK

Carl walks into the house, holding a single blue balloon.

INT. CARL'S BEDROOM - MORNING - SEVERAL YEARS LATER

An ALARM CLOCK BUZZES.    An aged hand shuts it off and picks

up the nearby glasses.

CARL sits alone in his double bed.   He rubs his face. GRUNTS.

He gets out of bed, STRETCHING, GRUNTING and CRACKING BONES.

He grabs his cane, with four tennis balls stuck to the bottom

spokes.

INT. CARL'S STAIRCASE - LATER

Now dressed, Carl rides his ELDERLY ASSISTANCE CHAIR down the

staircase. This takes a LONG, LONG time.

Three quarters of the way down, the chair stops.    He bangs

the armrest and the chair restarts.

INT. CARL'S KITCHEN - LATER

Carl eats breakfast by himself.

INT. CARL'S LIVING ROOM WINDOW - LATER

Carl cleans the window with a cloth.    His lonely reflection

stares back at him.

INT. CARL'S LIVING ROOM - LATER

Carl dusts the mantle and Shrine to Adventure.

INT. CARL'S HOUSE, FRONT HALL - LATER

Carl looks in the hall mirror. He puts on his hat and

considers his reflection. He straightens his GRAPE SODA PIN.

EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, PORCH - CONTINUOUS

Many LOCKS are heard unlocking from inside.

The door opens, but bangs against the safety chain.      Carl

GRUMBLES in frustration.

Carl opens the door, walks out onto his porch, pulls the door

shut, and looks as if he's about to go somewhere.

He sits in his porch chair.

EXT. CARL'S NEIGHBORHOOD - CONTINUOUS

Carl's house is the lone surviving square on the block not

under construction. Machinery and workers circle busily.

High rise buildings are being erected all around.

EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, PORCH - MORNING

Carl looks at the activity around him.

Carl walks to the mailbox.    He touches Ellie's faded

HANDPRINT and smiles.

He looks through the mail.

He sees a SHADY OAKS RETIREMENT VILLAGE pamphlet full of

images of happy old people. Carl scoffs.

Carl notices DUST on his mailbox.

He pulls up a LEAF BLOWER.   He revs it and blasts off the dust.

TOM, the CONSTRUCTION FOREMAN, notices.

He points across the lot to a business man in a suit talking

on a cell phone - the REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER.

The leaf blower blasts off his hat.

Tom hands Carl his MEGAPHONE.

Tom grabs the megaphone.

Carl walks to his front door.

Carl SLAMS the door.

INT. CARL'S LIVING ROOM - DAY - LATER

Carl sits in his chair watching TV.

A KNOCK at the door.

EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, PORCH - DAY

The door opens.

A Wilderness Explorer stands, reading from a Wilderness

Explorer Manual. He is in uniform, complete with sash,

neckerchief, hat, and an enormous backpack stuffed with every

piece of equipment there is. This is RUSSELL, age 8.

Russell, nose buried in his MANUAL, reads to Carl.

As he finishes the script, Russell smiles up at Carl.

Carl closes the door in Russell's face.

INT. CARL'S HOUSE, FRONT HALL - CONTINUOUS

Carl listens through the door. Is the kid gone?   He opens it.

Russell stops... but goes back to reading.

Carl swings the door shut, but a small camping boot stops it.

Carl opens the door.    Russell stands at attention.

Russell points to his SASH. It is covered with badges except

for one glaringly empty space.

Russell makes the Explorer Sign: his thumbs form a "W", his

fingers the "wings" of a bird, then the "claws" of a bear.

This sets Carl's hearing aid off. Carl GRUMBLES in pain.

Carl leans in close to Russell.

Russell runs down the block clapping and calling.

Carl rolls his eyes and begins to close his door.

He stops short.

A large truck is backing up, getting dangerously close to

ELLIE'S MAILBOX.

The truck hits Ellie's mailbox, crushing the front.

Carl is shocked.   He runs to the box.

The worker bangs on the mailbox, trying to fix it.

Carl grabs the mailbox, trying to wrestle it from the worker.

Carl HITS the worker with his cane.      He falls to the sidewalk.

The worker rubs his head.    Blood.

Carl backs up toward his door, cradling his mailbox.     What

has he done?

Passerbys stare.

Workers gather, as does the REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER.

Carl backs into his house.

INT. CARL'S LIVING ROOM

Carl shuts his door.   He closes the curtains.

He peeks out the window. The injured worker is helped to his

feet. A police car pulls up.

The Real Estate Developer looks toward Carl's house.     His

hand rests on Carl's fence.

INT. COURTHOUSE HALLWAY - DAY

Carl sits alone on a bench holding a Court Summons.

INT. COURTROOM - DAY

A GUARD opens the door. Carl enters.    The REAL ESTATE

DEVELOPER watches him enter.

EXT. CARL'S HOUSE - LATE EVENING

A Police Officer drops Carl at his front gate.

She hands him a pamphlet for SHADY OAKS RETIREMENT VILLAGE.

The officer drives off, leaving Carl alone.

Carl faces the house.    He touches Ellie's dented mailbox.

INT. CARL'S HOUSE, HALLWAY - NIGHT

All is quiet but the slow ticking of the clock.

The empty hall.

The front hall mirror.

The kitchen.

INT. CARL'S HOUSE, CLOSET

Carl pulls out a suitcase.   A book tips over.   Ellie's

Adventure Book.

INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM

Carl sits in his chair slowly paging through the book.

He turns to the page marked "STUFF I'M GOING TO DO."    He

closes the book and sighs.

Carl looks at the Adventure Shrine, and the PAINTING of their

house by Paradise Falls.

He holds the Shady Oaks pamphlet.

Carl's brows furrow.    He looks up at the shrine, and crosses

his heart.

EXT. CARL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Lights are on inside the house.

EXT. CARL'S HOUSE - MORNING

A SHADY OAKS RETIREMENT VILLAGE van pulls up.

Nurses GEORGE and A.J. walk to Carl's door and KNOCK.

Carl answers, holding a suitcase.

Carl hands over his suitcase.

Carl closes the door.   Rather sharply.   The nurses head back

to the van.

Empty helium tanks are strewn on the front lawn.

A SHADOW falls over the nurses.   They turn to look.

A giant tarp rises behind Carl's house.     It unfolds to reveal

THOUSANDS OF BALLOONS.

The balloons rise up like some massive multi-colored cumulus

cloud forming a thunderhead above the house.

Strings tug at the chimney. The house strains.     Pipes bend,

then break. Electrical wires spark and snap.

The house rips away from its foundation.

The nurses duck and YELL as the house soars over them.    Carl

looks out the window and LAUGHS.

INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Balloons spill colored light into a little girl's room as the

house floats past.

EXT. TOWN

The shadow of the house drifts through an intersection.

EXT. SHOP WINDOW

A family watches the house float down the street.

EXT. ABOVE THE TOWN

Carl waves at a high-rise window washer, who tentatively

waves back.

The house crests the top of a building, drifting over and away

from the city. Carl looks out his window. Good riddance.

INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM

Carl sets a compass next to the map of South America.

EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, BEDROOM WINDOW

Sails made from stitched-together curtains emerge from the

windows and billow in the wind. Carl steers using ropes

attached to the weather vane.

INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM

The compass needle rotates to point SOUTH.

EXT. CARL'S HOUSE

The house turns.

Carl looks out the window, satisfied.   He checks the balloons.

INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM

Carl kisses a photo of Ellie.

Carl kneels at the fireplace and plunks the balloon strings

tied to the grate.

He CHUCKLES and settles into his chair.   He closes his eyes

and smiles.

SHADOWS move gently across the fireplace mantle.

EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, FLOATING

The house drifts through the clouds.

INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM

Carl relaxes in his chair.

KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK.

He stares at the front door.   Nothing.

KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK.

He bolts up and approaches the door. He looks out the peep

hole. Nothing but the porch and clouds. He throws it open.

EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, PORCH - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Nothing. He looks left.     Nothing.   He looks right.   Russell.

He looks... Russell?!!

Russell is plastered up against the wall, terrified and

holding on for dear life.

The flag on Russell's backpack blows off and falls through

the clouds.

Carl slams the door, leaving Russell alone.

Beat. The door opens again.

Russell runs into the house past Carl.

INT. CARL'S HOUSE, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Russell PANTS, panicked.   He looks into living room.

Carl follows Russell into the living room.   Russell chuckles

and points at the photo of young Ellie.

Russell finds Ellie's house drawing sitting on the pages of

the open atlas.

Carl takes the page and puts it in his pocket.

Russell runs over to the steering rig.

Russell steers and the house tilts, knocking Carl back and

forth.

Russell looks out the window in front of him.

EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, WINDOW - CONTINUOUS

Russell and Carl arrive at the window.

That gives Carl an idea.

Carl lowers Russell on a rope below the floating house.

The rope slips through Carl's hands.   Russell FALLS.

Carl stands beside Russell at the window.    Russell's fall had

been a daydream.

Carl leaves Russell at the window.

INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS

GRUMBLING, Carl kneels at the fireplace to cut a few balloon

strings with his housekeys.

Carl turns off his hearing aid.    Silence.   He smiles.

Russell tries to get Carl's attention.   A storm is brewing in

the distance.

A huge lightning bolt flash lights up the room.    Carl turns

on his hearing aid.

EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, WINDOW - CONTINUOUS

Carl joins Russell at the window.

INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The tiny house is heading for a MASSIVE STORM.

Carl STRUGGLES to steer the house away but is blown into the

storm. The steering mechanism recoils and sends Carl flying.

Plates fall from the walls and furniture slides as the house

is rocked in the storm.

Russell's backpack slides toward the front door.

Russell HOPS on top of the backpack.

The pack slides toward the OPEN FRONT DOOR. Russell screams.

He's about to slide out when the house tilts and the door

swings shut.

The Paradise Falls jar rolls past Carl.     He chases after it.

Ellie's chair slides across the room.      Carl gasps and runs to

protect it.

The photo of Ellie rocks and slides off the wall.     Carl

lunges to catch it.

EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, FLOATING

The storm rages.    The house is tossed into the storm clouds.

All goes black.

INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - MORNING

Carl is asleep.

A finger pokes Carl's face.     Nothing.

The finger pokes Carl's face again.    Carl WAKES UP.

Carl STRUGGLES to rise from the pile of Ellie's things he'd

been protecting.

EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, WINDOW

Carl opens the window and looks out.

EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, FLOATING

The house floats motionless above an ocean of clouds.

INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM

Russell holds up his WILDERNESS EXPLORER GPS UNIT.

Russell gestures, tossing the unit out the window.

clouds.

INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM

Russell follows Carl toward the front door.

EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, FLOATING

The house lowers into the fog.

EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, PORCH

Carl and Russell stand on the porch as the house moves down

into and through the thick, dark clouds.

Something flashes by them in the fog.   Carl leans forward.

Another dark object whooshes past them.   Carl ducks.

A brief view of rocks directly below them.

Carl GASPS.

EXT. MOUNTAIN, ROCKY LANDSCAPE

BAM!!!   The house CRASHES into the ground.

Russell and Carl fly off the porch and onto the ground.   They

land hard.

Carl's house is floating away!

Carl runs after the GARDEN HOSE dragging across the ground.

Carl grabs the hose and is PULLED UP in the air.

Russell JUMPS onto Carl's leg and the extra weight pulls them

to the ground.

Carl and Russell slide toward the edge of a CLIFF EDGE.

They slide toward the edge... and stop.   The drop is

thousands of feet. Carl is TERRIFIED.

Russell PULLS Carl by the leg away from the cliff edge.

Carl, still hanging from the hose, looks around.

Fog blankets the mysterious landscape, revealing only

scattered rocks.

The wind picks up and they STRUGGLE against it.

The wind clears the fog, slowly revealing a crescent shaped,

flat-topped mountain on which they stand.

Across it, some ten miles away, is PARADISE FALLS.

Carl stares.   He can't believe it.

The landscape is stunning.

Carl shows Russell the engraving with the Ellie drawing of

the house atop the falls.

Russell CLIMBS Carl, stepping on his leg, arms, and face.

The hose jiggles as Russell CLIMBS out of frame.

Russell continues to grunt and strain off screen.

Russell is just inches above Carl, still STRUGGLING to climb.

He slides down onto Carl's head, exhausted.

Carl paces.

Carl considers this.

EXT. MOUNTAIN, ROCKY LANDSCAPE, DAY - LATER

The house floats against the sky. The hose descends from the

house and "Y"s to tie to both Carl and Russell. They wear

the hose like a harness, pulling the house as they walk.

Russell inspects his surroundings.

Carl ROLLS HIS EYES.    He looks up at the house.

Russell looks up at the house.   Who's Carl talking to?

The WILDERNESS EXPLORER CALL sets off Carl's hearing aid.

They head toward Paradise Falls, some 10 miles away.

EXT. MOUNTAIN, JUNGLE CLEARING - DAY

Mist hangs ominously over a rocky landscape.

Something tall blasts through a maze of rocks.

Two dark shapes are chasing the prey.   Each has a light.

Hunters.

EXT. MOUNTAIN, GROVE OF TREES - CONTINUOUS

The prey dodges various TRAPS, one after another. A metal

cage slams shut, a hidden net, darts on a trip wire.

The prey runs into a clearing surrounded by rocks: a dead end.

EXT. MOUNTAIN, CLEARING - CONTINUOUS

The hunters surround the prey, stepping out into the light: a

sinister Doberman Pinscher, a Rottweiler, and a bulldog, each

wearing large, HIGH-TECH COLLARS.

They surround the prey.   Escape looks impossible.

WOOSH! The bird moves impossibly fast, jumping over the

three dogs and escaping in a flash.

The dogs head off in pursuit.

A HIGH PITCHED SQUEAL stops the dogs short, their ears

wincing in pain. They whimper and run off.

EXT. MOUNTAIN, THICK JUNGLE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

Carl steps out from behind a shrub.   The SQUEALING is in fact

his HEARING AID.

Russell plods forward, dragging his feet.

Russell goes limp and lies face down in the dirt.

Russell rolls over to show Carl a badge.

Somehow energized, Russell jams his pack into Carl's hands,

secures his rope to a tree and tromps off into the shrubs.

He goes into the woods carrying a small shovel in one hand

and a pile of leaves in another.

Carl waits, standing by the tree his house is tied to.

Beat.

Carl covers his ears.

EXT. MOUNTAIN, THICK JUNGLE - CONTINUOUS

Russell pats down a mound and SIGHS in satisfaction.

He is about to return to Carl when he spots some TRACKS.

Russell follows the tracks into the dark jungle, clapping.

The footprints continue for a time, then stop.

Russell munches on a chocolate bar.

Something RUSTLES in the bushes behind him.   He turns to look.

Behind him, A BEAK takes a nibble of the chocolate and zips

out.

Russell turns.    Nothing there.

Another nibble!   Zip!

Russell peers into the shrub.

Russell holds out the chocolate.   The beak pokes out and

nibbles.

The beak zips back into the bushes.

A massive shadowy creature rises up over Russell.

EXT. MOUNTAIN, THICK JUNGLE CLEARING

Carl checks the knot on his hose harness.    Russell and the

massive creature step up behind him.

Carl turns to look.

Next to Russell stands a 13 foot tall, multicolored BIRD.

Carl SCREAMS.

Carl grabs Russell, pulling him away from the bird.

The bird HISSES at Carl and grabs Russell back.   It cradles

Russell like a baby.

Russell GIGGLES.

Carl pokes at the bird with his cane, trying to scare it off.

The bird HISSES.

It takes Russell up into a tree, swinging him around

playfully. It looks scary and fun.

The bird grooms Russell.

Carl pokes the bird with his cane.

The bird sets Russell down.     It stalks Carl, HISSING and

ruffling its feathers.

Russell pats Carl on the head.

The bird pats Carl on the head with its beak.

Carl waves his cane.    The bird eats it.

The bird chokes and the cane comes back up.

Carl shoos the bird away.     The bird mimics him.

GRUMBLING, Carl gives up and throws his hands in the air.

The bird mimics this as well.

Russell points up to the roof of Carl's house.

The bird is on Carl's roof. It swallows a balloon. It POPS.

The bird coughs up the deflated balloon. Russell GIGGLES.

The bird jumps down and hides behind Russell.

The bird HISSES at Carl.

EXT. MOUNTAIN, ROCKY LANDSCAPE - DAY

Carl and Russell pull the house through the mist.

Russell discreetly drops chocolate pieces along their trail.

The bird follows, eating.

It "hides" behind a rock, still totally visible.

The bird dashes away.

Carl and Russell look around. In the midst, some 100 feet

away, they see the FIGURE OF A MAN.

Carl walks toward the man.

Carl stops.

As they get closer, they realize the man is in fact a ROCK.

Russell GIGGLES.

Russell points to another rock shape.

Sure enough.

The "rock" walks forward.

The dog nuzzles Russell, who nervously pets it.

The dog sits.

The dog raises his paw and Russell shakes it.

Carl and Russell freeze.

Carl JUMPS back.

Dug jumps up on to Carl.

Dug wears a high-tech collar. The dog's thoughts come out of

it as words through a speaker. It can talk. Unfortunately,

it talks non-stop.

Dug stares transfixed at a tree.    False alarm.

He inspects the collar and twists a dial.

Dug sniffs the ground around Carl and Russell.

BAM!   The bird tackles Dug and HISSES.

Dug BARKS.

Dug HOWLS.    The bird HISSES at Dug.

Russell falls to his knees, pleading.

Carl grabs Russell.   The bird follows, as does Dug.

EXT. MOUNTAIN, THICK JUNGLE CLEARING - DAY

Footprints.   A dog's nose follows the tracks.   This is GAMMA,

a bulldog.

A second dog: BETA, a Rottweiler.

ALPHA, a Doberman pinscher, sits with his back to them.

Alpha's voice is high and squeaky, as if he's breathed in

helium.

Beta and Gamma look at each other.

Beta and Gamma LAUGH.   Alpha turns.   They stop laughing.

All three dogs look for the squirrel.   False alarm.

Beta and Gamma SNICKER derisively.

Alpha powers up a video screen on Beta's collar.

The screen shows ground moving past: the view from Dug's

collar.

The screen view adjusts to see the bird.   It hisses.

On the collar screen, the dogs get a fleeting glimpse of a

boy's face. It's Russell.

The video screen goes blank.   The dogs BARK excitedly.

Alpha pushes a button on Beta's collar.    A TRACKING DEVICE

locates Dug.

The dogs sprint off into the jungle.

EXT. MOUNTAIN, JUNGLE - DAY

The bird drags Dug, still clamped onto it's leg.

The bird HISSES.

The bird tries to shake Dug off its leg.   Dug jumps up on it.

Russell tries to separate them, which pulls on Carl's tether.

Carl pulls on the tether, knocking Russell over.   Carl falls,

pulling the house into a tall rock. SMASH!

Carl GASPS.   He turns his anger to the group.

Dug sees the tennis balls on Carl's cane.

Carl pops off one of the tennis balls.

Carl throws the ball far away.    Dug chases after it.

Carl grabs some chocolate and waves it at the bird.

Carl THROWS the chocolate.     The bird runs after it.

Carl grabs Russell and runs.

EXT. MOUNTAIN HILLSIDE

Carl pulls them down a slope.     He slips.

EXT. MOUNTAIN TREETOPS

Above the tree line, the house SMASHES into a tree.

EXT. MOUNTAIN STREAM

Carl and Russell crossing the river balance on rocks.        Carl

slips and his foot goes into the water.

EXT. MOUNTAIN JUNGLE

Carl pushes through thick jungle leaves.      BUGS buzz around him.

EXT. MOUNTAIN STEEP HILLSIDE

Carl climbs up the hill.      He FALLS over a dead branch.

EXT. MOUNTAIN, JUNGLE CLEARING - CONTINUOUS

They climb over a ridge.      Dug and the bird are nowhere in sight.

Carl sits down on a rock, BREATHING HARD.

He turns.   Dug.     With the ball in his mouth.

Carl turns the other way.       The bird.   It HONKS at him.

Dug drops the slobbery ball on Carl's lap.

EXT. MOUNTAIN, FLAT ROCKY AREA - NIGHT

A clap of thunder. Lightning flashes reveal rain pouring

down on the house. Beneath it, Carl and Russell are kept

dry, sitting around a pathetic flickering campfire.

Carl looks at Dug, asleep, wrapped around the bird's leg.        He

rolls his eyes and looks up at the house.

Russell struggles to set up the tent.       He reads his manual.

Carl ROLLS HIS EYES at Russell's ineptness.

Russell struggles with a tent pole, trying to winch it into

place.

Carl can't watch.

An off screen SMACK!      Russell walks to Carl.   Miraculously,

he looks unscathed.

Russell turns, revealing a large RED WELT on his face.

The tent pole springs loose, catapulting the tent over the

cliff.

Carl realizes he put his foot in it.

The two sit silently together, watching the fire.

Carl studies Russell's sad optimism.   He looks at the missing

badge on Russell's sash.

Dug nuzzles around the sleeping bird's leg.

Russell YAWNS and lies down on the rock next to Carl.

Carl looks down at Russell.

Carl sits at the campfire, the others asleep.    He shakes his

head and looks up at the house.

EXT. MOUNTAIN, FLAT ROCKY AREA - MORNING

A frog sits next to Carl's glasses. It CROAKS. Carl's hand

smacks it like an alarm clock. The frog hops away.

Carl rises, looking up at the house.

The balloons on the house are wilting.

He scans the camp.   The bird is gone.

Russell sits up with a SNORT.

Dug crazily searches and sniffs, looking for the bird.

Dug goes rigid like a pointer dog and "points" to the left.

Russell points to the right.   The bird is on top of Carl's

house.

Dug turns around.

The bird has gathered a pile of food on Carl's roof.

In the distance, BABY BIRDS call out.   The bird CALLS back.

The bird gobbles the food and jumps off the roof.

Miles off is a huge grouping of rocks; the LABYRINTH.   The

baby birds call from somewhere inside.

The bird "hugs" Russell goodbye and pats Carl on the head

with her beak. She HISSES at Dug.

The bird hurries off toward the labyrinth.   Carl gathers up

the hose tether.

EXT. MOUNTAIN, EDGE OF JUNGLE - MOMENTS LATER

The bird rounds a corner and hears rustling in the bushes

ahead. She scampers back toward the house.

EXT. MOUNTAIN, FLAT ROCKY AREA

Russell chews on some chocolate.

Carl rolls his eyes and SIGHS.

They hear rustling from the bushes behind them.

Beta and Gamma, run toward Carl and Russell, viciously

barking and growling. Carl protects Russell with his cane.

Dug is conflicted.

Alpha walks forward and stares menacingly at Carl.

He turns toward Dug.

Alpha BARKS angrily.

Carl and Russell look at Dug.    He turned on them!   Dug

shamefully lowers his head.

Gamma and Beta BARK fiercely at Carl.

The dogs lead Carl and Russell like prisoners.    Dug follows.

The house is pulled after them, and on the roof: THE BIRD.

EXT. MOUNTAIN, DESOLATE ROCKY AREA - DAY

Alpha leads Carl and Russell through a canyon.

Dogs patrol the tops of the canyon walls.

Four more large dogs join the group.    Carl and Russell watch

warily and continue their march.

They round a bend.     Before them is a MASSIVE CAVE OPENING.

EXT. MOUNTAIN, CAVE ENTRANCE

The house and balloon canopy are dwarfed as the group

approaches the huge cave opening.

DOZENS OF DOGS step out of the cave. Carl and Russell stop.

More dogs approach from the side. Every way Carl turns there

are more dogs!

Growling and snarling, the dogs surround Carl and Russell.

Closer... closer...

From the darkness a voice:

The dogs stop. A figure peers out from the darkness.      It

examines Carl, Russell, and the floating house.

The man laughs.   Carl and Russell laugh along nervously.

The dogs LAUGH uproariously at the man's joke.

The figure walks out toward Carl into the light.   Carl

recognizes him!

Muntz gives him the "thumbs up."

Carl GIGGLES with glee.

Carl rushes to shake Muntz's hand.    Muntz is charmed.

Muntz LAUGHS at his joke.    Carl joins in.

The dogs CHEER.

Muntz walks into the cave. Carl and Russell excitedly follow.

INT. CAVE - CONTINUOUS

Carl's eyes adjust to the dark. Muntz's dirigible the

"Spirit of Adventure" is tethered in the cave.

Muntz gestures to a pylon, where Carl ties off the house.

Muntz and the dogs walk up the gangplank of the dirigible.

Carl GIGGLES like a little boy.

Carl and Russell follow up the ramp.

Dug follows, but is blocked by Alpha and Beta.

Dug WHIMPERS.

EXT. DIRIGIBLE GANGPLANK - MOMENTS LATER

Alpha, Gamma and Beta walk into the dirigible.   Dug sits

forlornly with a PLASTIC CONE around his neck.

INT. DIRIGIBLE - TROPHY ROOM

Carl and Russell are speechless as they walk into the room.

It's a treasure trove of giant skeletons, stuffed creatures,

and rare cultural artifacts.

Various servant dogs dust and polish as Muntz leads Carl and

Russell through the room.

A dog approaches carrying a menu.    Muntz waves it off.

Muntz LAUGHS.   Behind him, a dog can't resist gnawing at one

of the bones.

A dog approaches with a bottle of champagne in his mouth.

Muntz glances at the bottle.

Two dogs work together to remove the cork from the bottle.

POP! They sloppily pour two glasses.

Muntz and Carl LAUGH.   Alpha interrupts.

Russell reacts.

Muntz LAUGHS.

INT. DIRIGIBLE, DINING ROOM

Muntz leads Carl and Russell into the dining room and up to a

large table.

Dogs pull back chairs for them.   They sit.   Dog waiters place

napkins on their laps.

Dogs bring out covered plates, look at each other, and remove

the silver plate covers at the same time. The meals look

delicious.

Russell is served a hot dog.   His waiter can't resist and

eats a bite.

Another dog pours some juice then takes a big slurp from his

glass.

Carl looks around, still enthralled.

He gestures toward HIS HOUSE, tethered outside the porthole

window.

The dogs erupt into excited barking.

In the excitement a dog swipes the rest of Russell's hot dog.

Muntz picks up a lantern and walks to the back of the room.

The lantern illuminates photographs, drawings, samples,

feathers. Hundreds of them... all of THE BIRD. Kevin.

This is Muntz's obsession. He looks over to a full size

skeleton.

Muntz is lost in reverie.

Distracted Russell finally notices the skeleton.

Muntz and Alpha exchange glances.

Russell holds up a chocolate bar to show Muntz.

Carl swipes the chocolate from Russell and pockets it.

Muntz stares.

He walks to a table full of flight helmets.

Using his cane, Muntz topples a helmet from the table.   It

rolls across the floor.

Muntz topples another helmet.

He lifts a third to show Carl.

He drops the helmet.   It rolls to Carl's feet.

Carl glances around nervously.

Out the window, sitting on the roof of his house, sits THE

BIRD!

Carl gets up and pulls Russell from the table.

Carl leads Russell toward the door.

Muntz follows behind them slowly, menacingly.

Carl pulls Russell along, Muntz following behind like

something out of a bad dream.

A distant HAUNTED WAIL.         Everyone stops.

Muntz walks to the window and looks out.          Atop the roof he

sees THE BIRD.

He turns back to Carl... but they're gone.

INT. CAVE

Carl and Russell untie Carl's house from the pylon.

Dogs descend down the ramp behind them.

Carl and Russell run toward the cave opening.

Dogs block the cave opening.        Carl stops short.

Dug points to a tunnel opening deeper inside the cave.     Carl

and Russell run toward him.

The cave leads to a steep incline.      The dogs are getting

closer.

There's no choice but to JUMP.

The lift from the overhead balloons allows Carl and Russell

to leap down the incline, like astronauts.

Dogs climb down the rocks, closing in on Carl and Russell.

The bird sees the dogs. She jumps off the house and lifts

Carl and Russell on her back.

She runs through the cave, towing the house behind her.

Russell and Carl HANG ON for dear life.

BANG BANG BANG! Balloons pop as they scrape across the

ceiling. The house lowers.

Ahead, a giant rock sits in their path. Carl tugs at the

house but it CRASHES against the rock, pulling Russell onto

the ground.

Dragging on the ground, Russell gets BUMPED around badly.

EXT. MOUNTAIN, CANYON - CONTINUOUS

The dogs close in on Russell. Alpha bites at his heels.

Carl fends off Alpha with his cane.

Alpha is about to bite when an avalanche of boulders rains

down! The dogs stop short.

Carl looks back as the bird keeps running.      Dug is up on the

canyon wall. He caused the avalanche!

Dug jumps down to block the path of the approaching dogs.

The dogs run around Dug.

Alpha bites Dug by the neck and throws him out of the path.

The bird carries Carl, Russell dragging along behind.    She

rounds a corner. Russell SWINGS OUT over the abyss.

The bird jumps from rock spire to spire.   Russell swings back

and forth wildly in the air.

Russell does the WILDERNESS EXPLORER CALL.

Carl holds out his cane so that Russell can GRAB it and Carl

PULLS him back onto the bird.

Meanwhile Dug manages to rejoin his friends, but just in time

to reach the end of the line -- A CLIFF EDGE.   A river winds

100 feet below.

Carl looks above to see the house's momentum pulling forward.

Carl grabs onto Kevin and picks Dug up by the collar.

Just as the dogs reach our gang, the house's momentum carries

them across the chasm. Alpha bites the bird on the leg but

is kicked loose and falls into the river below.

Carl LANDS HARD but safely across the river chasm.     The dogs

are stuck on the other side.

Carl painfully gets up.    He looks up at his house.   It's

still intact.

He breathes a SIGH OF RELIEF.

The bird tries to stand but SQUAWKS pitifully and falls back

to the ground. Russell rushes to her side.

The bird's leg has been injured badly by the dog bite.   She

can't stand.

Russell applies a bandage.

From the distant labyrinth of rocks, the BIRD BABIES call.

Kevin CALLS back to them. She tries to stand, but can't.

Russell runs to her side.

Carl looks at the bird's wounds.   He looks to the rock maze,

then to his house.

He knows the right thing to do.    And he hates himself for it.

INT. DIRIGIBLE, COCKPIT

Dripping wet dogs cower in front of a menacing Muntz.

Muntz snarls in anger.

He leans over a RADAR TRACKING DEVICE.

EXT. MOUNTAIN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

DUG'S COLLAR SCREEN powers on, and a signal zeroes in on

Dug's location.

Dug, oblivious, looks out over the landscape, sniffing.

Carl and Russell peek out from behind a tree.

Dug scampers back to Carl and Russell, who pull the house

from behind a tree canopy.

They pull the house, keeping it hidden behind the trees.

The house bumps into a tree, jostling the injured BIRD on the

porch.

Kevin goes back to sleep.    Russell looks at her BANDAGED LEG.

Russell smiles at the thought.

He looks up at Carl.

They walk in silence.   Carl understands.

The bird babies CALL OUT in the distance.    Kevin CALLS BACK.

Russell spots the labyrinth, now close by.   He tries to run

but is pulled back by his tether.

LAUGHING, Carl unclips Russell's tether.

Carl ties the hose harnesses to a tree, securing the house.

Russell helps Kevin off the porch and the group run toward

the labyrinth entrance.

Kevin is reenergized by the sound of her babies.   She runs

off ahead. Carl and Russell LAUGH.

Just as they approach the entrance to the labyrinth, a fierce

spotlight hits them. MUNTZ'S DIRIGIBLE lowers overhead.

A net shoots out and binds her. She falls and CALLS OUT.

The net catches on a rock. Carl and Russell run to her aid.

Carl saws frantically at the net.

Muntz and his dogs descend from the dirigible.     Beside them,

a group of dogs drag forward CARL'S HOUSE.

Muntz hurls a lit lantern.      Flames burst up beneath the house.

Heat waves ripple up.   Balloons POP.    Carl's house LOWERS

into the fire.

INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Inside the living room, Ellie's photo crashes to the floor.

EXT. MOUNTAIN, LABYRINTH GATE - CONTINUOUS

Carl panics.    He rushes toward the house, dropping the knife.

Muntz motions to the dogs. They swarm past Russell, knocking

him down and grabbing the bird in the net.

Carl pulls his house away from the flames.

The bird CALLS OUT plaintively as the dogs drag her into the

dirigible.

Muntz follows the bird up the ramp of the dirigible.

Russell runs after the dogs, but the gangplank closes.

The dirigible flies off.

Carl beats out the flames with his jacket.     He extinguishes

the flames.

Carl collapses on the side of his house.

Dug slinks off, tail between his legs.

Carl angrily puts on the harness.

He walks off.   Russell falls in behind.

An angry dawn breaks.

EXT. MOUNTAIN, ROCKY TERRAIN - DAY

Now barely aloft, Carl pulls the house across the rocky

landscape.

Russell's harness drags along side, empty.

Russell walks behind.

EXT. MOUNTAIN HILLSIDE - MORNING

With the last of his energy, Carl drags the house into place.

The house groans as it comes to rest.

Carl drops the hose harness and walks to the edge of a cliff.

EXT. PARADISE FALLS - MORNING

He looks over. He's finally made it: Paradise Falls.

Torrents of water careen over the massive cliff edge.

Carl takes out Ellie's childhood drawing.    Next to him stands

the real house, just like Ellie wanted.

Behind him, Russell throws his sash on the ground.

Russell walks away.   He sits on a rock, alone.

Carl picks up the sash.   He walks up the steps of his house.

INT. CARL'S HOUSE, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

The door opens. Carl steps in.   He's back in his house for

the first time in days.

INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Carl and Ellie's things are strewn across the floor, a mess

from the rough journey.

Carl rights Ellie's chair, sets the lamp upright, slides the

table into position.

He pushes their two chairs back into their place.

Carl closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, and sits.

Quiet.

Nothing, save the distant sound of the falls outside.

Carl surveys the room.

The ADVENTURE BOOK rests on a table near him.   He opens it

and puts Ellie's drawing back.

He looks through the pages, remembering the newspaper

clippings and old photographs, the dreams of young Ellie.

He turns to the page marked: STUFF I'M GOING TO DO.

Carl sighs. He managed to bring the house to the falls, but

Ellie never made it.

He closes the book.   But as he does, Carl sees something he

hadn't before.

The blank pages at the end are no longer blank.

A WEDDING PHOTO of the two of them.

On a picnic. Celebrating birthdays. Another and another...

photos of their ordinary life together, the ups and downs.

Carl's face warms. Ellie lived the life she wanted: she saw

adventure in everyday life.

A photo of the two of them sitting side by side, together, in

their chairs. Beneath it, Ellie has written:

Carl smiles.

He looks over to Ellie's empty chair.   On the arm is

Russell's sash. Carl picks it up.

He looks to Ellie's chair.

He crosses his heart.

EXT. CARL'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Carl walks from the house and calls from the porch.

But Russell is nowhere to be seen.

A shadow crosses Carl. He looks up to see Russell floating

off, hanging from a BUNCH OF BALLOONS.

Russell fires up a LEAF BLOWER and steers himself off into

the sky.

Carl runs back to his house and tries in desperation to lift

it. He struggles, but the house doesn't budge. The balloons

have lost too much helium.

Furious, he THROWS a chair off his porch.    It lands atop the

mountain rocks with a thud.

This gives him an idea.

The GRAMOPHONE smashes onto the rocky ground. Chairs,

dressers, tables; Carl throws them all out of the house.

Slowly, one corner of the house lifts.   Then another.

Carl struggles to push a refrigerator from the porch.    It

teeters... and falls. The house lifts off!

The house floats off into the sky, leaving a huge pile of

things. Beside it sits Carl and Ellie's chairs, side by side

atop Paradise Falls.

EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, FLOATING

The house soars into the air, sails billowing.

INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM

Inside the house, Carl adjusts his steering, scans the skies.

KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK.    Carl's eyes go wide.

INT. CARL'S HOUSE, PORCH - CONTINUOUS

The door swings open.

Dug lunges forward and overwhelms Carl with dog kisses.

EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, FLOATING - CONTINUOUS

The house flies off into the sky.

EXT. OPEN SKY - DAY

Russell steers through the clouds toward the DIRIGIBLE.

INT. DIRIGIBLE - CONTINUOUS

Dogs play poker. Behind them, Russell flies past with the

leaf blower. They turn to look.

EXT. DIRIGIBLE

Russell steers wobbly toward an open dirigible window.    He

smashes into the wall.

He tries again and TUMBLES through the window.

INT. DIRIGIBLE - CONTINUOUS

Russell releases the balloons and picks up the leaf blower,

ready for action.

Growling dogs move toward him.

Russell blows the leaf blower at the dogs.

INT. DIRIGIBLE, CAGE ROOM

Muntz stares into the bird's cage, mesmerized.     She's

miserable and scared.

Alpha enters.

INT. DIRIGIBLE

Dogs tie Russell to a chair.

Muntz enters.

Russell blows the leaf blower in Muntz's face.

Muntz grabs the leaf blower and drags Russell out.

INT. DIRIGIBLE, TROPHY ROOM

Muntz drags Russell through the trophy room.

INT. DIRIGIBLE, RAMP ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Muntz sets Russell down and walks to a control panel.

Muntz is about to throw a switch when he looks out the

porthole. Flying toward him is CARL'S HOUSE!

Muntz pulls the switch and walks out of the room.

Muntz slams the door.

Light emerges from the floor.    Russell is on the ramp, which

is opening. Russell REACTS.

INT. DIRIGIBLE, COCKPIT

Muntz enters the cockpit and takes the wheel.

EXT. DIRIGIBLE

The dirigible turns, revealing Carl's house sneaking up

behind.

INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM

Carl steers toward the cockpit. He dons Russell's sash, then

hooks his cane onto his back. He's fighting for a cause.

He hears SCREAMING. It's Russell! Tied to his chair, he

slides down the ramp as it lowers, closer and closer to the

edge.

Carl steers his house to the dirigible.

EXT. DIRIGIBLE, RAMP - CONTINUOUS

Carl flings the hose, HOOKING it to the ramp railing. Using

his cane as a zip line, Carl slides to Russell, catching him

just as Russell slides off the ramp edge. They land safely

together.

Dug winches in the hose caddy, pulling the house closer to

the dirigible ramp.

Carl carries Russell into the house.

INT. CARL'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Carl sets Russell, still bound, down in the front hall.

Carl leaps back into the dirigible.    Dug follows.

Russell STRUGGLES against his bonds.

INT. DIRIGIBLE, HALLWAY

Carl and Dug sneak down a hall. They see dogs ahead and hide.

Dug points to a grate in the wall.

INT. DIRIGIBLE, GAS CELL AREA

Dug leads Carl "backstage" through a vent shaft into the

dirigible. They sneak past two biplanes.

INT. DIRIGIBLE, CAGE ROOM

They emerge through a grate near the ceiling. They look down

into the room where the bird is kept in a cage.

The bird recognizes Carl and CRIES OUT.

Alpha enters, leading a group of dogs. Carl and Dug duck

into the shadows and watch unnoticed from above.

Dug is lost in ecstacy, chomping on a tennis ball on the end

of Carl's cane.

INT. DIRIGIBLE, CAGE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Carl drops down from the ceiling and stands on the cage.      He

bangs his cane. All the dogs turn.

He grabs a ball from his cane and waves it in the air.

Carl throws the ball.    The dogs scramble after it.

INT. DIRIGIBLE, HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF CAGE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The dogs pile into the hallway in pursuit.

Gamma catches it..

Behind them Carl shuts the door.    The dogs realize their

mistake.

INT. DIRIGIBLE, CAGE ROOM

Carl opens the cage door.

INT. DIRIGIBLE, COCKPIT

Muntz scans the horizon.    Suddenly the in-ship communicator

comes to life.

EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, FRONT PORCH

Russell STRUGGLES to break free of the chair.

He manages to get his arms free.

Except that all his struggling causes the chair to hop out on

the porch and fall off.

Russell SCREAMS as he falls.     The hose unspools.

Russell reaches the end of the hose. Russell grabs onto it

and the chair jostles free, falling thousands of feet down.

The house drifts away from the dirigible.

INT. DIRIGIBLE, COCKPIT

The melee of conflicting reports from the dogs continues.

On cue, Russell SPLATS into the dashboard window of the

control room and SQUEEGEES across, dangling from the hose.

Muntz stares, slack-jawed.

The house floats off.

EXT. CARL'S HOUSE

Russell clings to the end of the hose, swaying in the wind.

What's that noise?   From beneath the dirigible emerges...

EXT. OPEN SKY - CONTINUOUS

From beneath the dirigible, three spitfire airplanes emerge.

As they get closer, it is clear they are being flown by DOGS.

The planes fall into formation and fly toward the house.

The Dog Squadron Leader bites down on a squeaky bone chew toy

that fires poison darts.

The biplanes fire and strafe Carl's house with darts.

Russell SCREAMS, swaying beneath it on the hose.

INT. DIRIGIBLE, TROPHY ROOM

Carl, Dug and the bird escape through the trophy room.

Behind the door, Muntz is waiting for them.       He grabs a sword

from the wall display and attacks.

Dug hears and BITES Muntz on the leg.

Muntz kicks Dug loose and out the door.    He slams it shut.

INT. DIRIGIBLE, OUTSIDE OF TROPHY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Locked out, Dug jumps on the door and barks.

He hears growling and turns around.    There stands Alpha and

the other dogs.

INT. DIRIGIBLE, HALLWAY

Dug runs.   The dogs give chase.

INT. DIRIGIBLE, TROPHY ROOM

Muntz swings his sword at Carl but misses.    Carl uses his

cane to defend himself.

OLD MAN SWORD FIGHT!

Muntz smashes his trophy collection as he swings for Carl.

His sword gets stuck in a mounted skeleton.

Carl swings his cane and hits Muntz on the head. The tennis

balls bounce the cane off Muntz and smack Carl in the face.

Muntz pulls the sword free. He raises the sword over his

head to strike and his back CRACKS loudly. He's stuck! Carl

raises his cane over his head and his back CRACKS too.

Carl and Muntz STRUGGLE to move. Muntz CRACKS his back free

and kicks Carl in the chest, knocking him against a trophy.

He has the upper hand now. He throttles him with his arm and

lifts his sword.

Carl spits his FALSE TEETH at Muntz.    He falls backwards.

Carl collects his teeth and motions for Kevin.

Muntz advances on Carl, who struggles to protect the bird.

Muntz is a wild man now, smashing and destroying anything

that gets in his way.

Carl trips and falls to the floor.     Muntz is about to deal

the final blow.

INT. DIRIGIBLE, COCKPIT

Meanwhile Alpha backs Dug into the control panel.        He bumps a

a LEVER.

EXT. DIRIGIBLE - CONTINUOUS

The entire dirigible rocks wildly to the side.

INT. DIRIGIBLE, TROPHY ROOM

Muntz is knocked off balance.     He slides to one side.    Trophy

cases slide after him.

The dirigible tilts to the other side.

The broken trophy cases barrel straight toward Carl!

Carl is thrown into a window which bursts open. Carl falls

through but manages to grab the frame with his cane. He

dangles out over open air.

He sees the biplanes circling the house, Russell hanging

beneath it.

The ship corrects again.      Carl climbs back inside.

Muntz comes at Carl.

EXT. SIDE OF DIRIGIBLE - CONTINUOUS

Carl climbs the work ladder up the side of the dirigible.    He

pushes the bird along as he goes.

Muntz follows up.

INT. DIRIGIBLE, COCKPIT

Alpha throws Dug viciously across the room. Alpha throws him

again and Dug crashes into the steering wheel, knocking a

radar shade off the control panel.

Alpha moves in.     Dug hides behind the steering wheel.

Alpha lunges at Dug through the steering wheel.    Dug cowers,

but then notices the RADAR SHADE.

As Alpha lunges again, Dug jams the shade over Alpha's head.

Alpha's head is stuck, trapped by the cone.

The dogs all GASP.

The bump caused his collar to go funny again.    The dogs all

howl with laughter.

Surprised at Dug's moxy, Alpha sits.    All other dogs sit too.

EXT. CARL'S HOUSE

Russell TRIES TO CLIMB the hose.   His hands are about to give

out.

The biplanes head straight at Russell.

Behind him, Carl is climbing the side of the dirigible for

dear life, Muntz closing in.

Carl calls for help: the WILDERNESS EXPLORER CALL.

Russell CLIMBS!

He's more machine than boy now. Biplanes shooting the whole

way, he climbs up onto the porch.

The biplanes close in.

Russell yells to them.

All the dog pilots snap to attention.

The planes dive, crash into each other.   The dog pilots

parachute out.

EXT. SIDE OF DIRIGIBLE

Carl climbs. Muntz grabs Carl's foot. Carl defends himself

with his cane, knocking Muntz off the ladder. Muntz catches

on to a rung of the ladder.

He watches Carl and the bird climb.

Muntz descends the ladder.

EXT. DIRIGIBLE, TOP - DAY

Carl and the bird make it to the top of the dirigible.

Suddenly, a trap door opens. Carl GASPS... but it's Dug!

Dug jumps up on Carl, licking his face.

The house bears down on them.    They run to meet it.

Russell steers the house toward Carl.

The house slows and lowers atop the airship.    Carl HOISTS the

bird up onto the porch.

Carl helps Dug onto the porch.   He climbs up himself...

BLAM!   Muntz appears on top of the dirigible with a rifle!

A bullet blasts through Carl's balloon strings. A third of

them break or shoot skyward. The house plummets, crashing

onto the dirigible.

Carl is THROWN from the house onto the airship.

The house slides toward the edge, Russell, Dug and Kevin

still inside.

Carl SCRAMBLES to grab the hose trailing from the sliding

house. The house slides on to the dirigible's tail fin.

Holding the hose, Carl digs in his heels and is just able to

stop it.

The house teeters on the very edge of the tail fin.

Russell, Dug and Kevin run toward the front porch.

BLAM!   A bullet smashes the door jam next to them.

Muntz storms toward the house.    Carl holds desperately to the

hose.

Russell and others duck inside and slam the door.

The house tilts, threatening to tip off at any second.   Carl

holds on for his life.

Muntz POUNDS on the door with the butt of the rifle.

INT. CARL'S HOUSE, HALLWAY

Russell, Dug and Kevin back away from the door.

EXT. DIRIGIBLE, TOP

The house slides farther over the edge.

Carl struggles to hold on. The hose caddy is ripping free

from the house! The bolts pop from the wooden siding... it's

about to go!

INT. CARL'S HOUSE

Russell, Dug and Kevin run into the living room.

EXT. DIRIGIBLE, TOP

Muntz KICKS the door.

Suddenly, Carl has an idea.

INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM

Confused, Russell follows Carl's directions.   He Dug and the

bird huddle together.

Muntz breaks through the door.    He lifts his rifle and sights

the bird...

Through the window, Carl yells out.

EXT. DIRIGIBLE, TOP

Carl holds aloft a bar of chocolate.

INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM

Kevin lunges, pushing past Muntz and knocking the rifle from

his hands.

Muntz lunges after them.

EXT. CARL'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

The hose caddy breaks free.

Kevin leaps through the window, Russell and Dug hanging from

her side.

Muntz leaps after them.

But balloon strings tangle around his leg and pull him back.

Muntz hangs for a moment... It's thousands of feet from the

ground....

He falls.

EXT. DIRIGIBLE, TOP

PANTING, Carl is left holding the hose.   He PULLS himself

toward the edge.

The hose curves beneath the tail fin.    Finally it swings

out...

Russell and Dug dangle from it, sitting on Kevin.     The bird

holds on to the hose with her beak.

Carl LAUGHS, relieved.

Russell climbs up, followed by the bird and Dug.

Carl LAUGHS heartily as Dug jumps on him and licks his face.

Carl looks into the distance. His house, now empty, floats

softly down into the clouds, and disappears.

Carl smiles.   He puts his arm around Russell.

Carl, Russell, Dug and Kevin stand on the tail of the airship

floating off over the clouds.

EXT. MOUNTAIN, LABYRINTH GATE - AFTERNOON

Carl and Russell hold and cuddle the baby birds.     The babies

peck at Carl's head. Carl and Russell LAUGH.

Kevin CALLS OUT, waiting for the babies at the gate to the

LABYRINTH. Time to go.

The babies run to the bird.      One stops to HISS at Dug.

Carl has misplaced something.

Kevin starts HACKING.    She COUGHS up the cane.

Babies start HACKING too.     They COUGH up tennis balls.

The bird family enters the labyrinth.     Carl and Russell wave.

The bird looks back toward Carl and Russell and CALLS OUT one

last time before disappearing into the mist.

INT. DIRIGIBLE, COCKPIT - LATER

Carl and Russell both wear matching leather flight helmets

and goggles.

Carl gives a thumbs up.

EXT. DIRIGIBLE

Muntz's dirigible ascends into the sky. Dug and all of

MUNTZ'S DOGS stick their heads out the dirigible windows,

barking as they fly into the sunset.

INT. AUDITORIUM

Each Junior Wilderness Explorer stands next to his father.

As the Camp Master announces the achievement he hands the

father a badge, who pins it to his son's sash.

Russell is tanned and dirty.   And alone.

The Camp Master CLEARS HIS THROAT uncomfortably.   Russell

looks for his dad in the audience.

Carl takes his place next to Russell.

The Camp Master hands Carl the badge and continues down the

line.

Carl pins the badge onto the missing spot on Russell's sash.

It's Ellie's GRAPE SODA PIN.

Carl smiles.

They salute each other.      Russell gives Carl a hug.   Carl

returns it.

Russell's mom sits in the audience with Dug.     Russell proudly

shows her the badge.

The Camp Master leads the audience in the WILDERNESS EXPLORER

CALL.

Muntz's dogs sit in the back, BARKING in approval.

EXT. CURB OUTSIDE FENTONS ICE CREAM PARLOR - DAY

Carl and Russell sit on a curb licking ice cream cones.

Russell has chocolate and Carl has butter-brickle.

Cars pass by.

Russell GIGGLES.

They LAUGH.

Overhead, MUNTZ'S DIRIGIBLE is parked, its ladder in the

handicapped parking spot.

EXT. PARADISE FALLS - AFTERNOON

On top of Paradise Falls sits Carl's house, just as Ellie

imagined it.
