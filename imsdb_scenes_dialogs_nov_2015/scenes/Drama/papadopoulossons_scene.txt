Orphaned when he was just a boy, Harry

Papadopoulos came to this country with

nothing.

Harry was a grafter, entering the

restaurant trade as a young man.

(Beat) That's a euphemism for 'Greek

waiter' isn't it?

Only joking Harry. He then started the

now famous Papadopoulos & Sons - doing

all things Greek. From taramasalata to

olive oil and frozen mousakas - which,

I must admit, my wife and I are

partial to occasionally. Not one to

settle, Harry's made the move into

commercial property where he's about

to embark on one of the most audacious

developments yet - Papadopoulos Plaza.

A two million square foot

redevelopment in the heart of our

great city. (Applause from the

audience) Ladies and Gentlemen, I give

you European Entrepreneur of the Year.

Harry Papadopoulos.

That's lovely. (Referring to the

vase) Now just hold it up a bit for

me. Yeah, that's nice. Bunch up a

bit.

Just look at the camera.

A little bit more. Perfect. Now

touch the vase for me, if you don't

mind.

Touch it? What a perv.

(With a stammer) Katie. You're the

p... p... perv.

And you're the f.. f.. freak.

Shush.

Come on guys. Big smiles. Big smiles

for me.

Did you really work in a restaurant

Daddy?

A long time ago. Touch it.

Guys. This is supposed to be a

celebration. What's the Greek word? Is

it Opa? Opa?

Touch the vase.

Cheese!!!

Congratulations from the Prime

Minister. Sir Derek Otterly was there

today Mrs Parrington.

I don't know him.

Sir Derek? You must remember him. He's

been to the house.

They all blur.

That's because they're all so dull.

Weird. Gold doing well. Tech stocks

down.

Nice one Mrs P.

Oh, thanks Dave. Would you like to

stay for some supper?

Oh no. Best not. Got some dinner at

home. That's a nice vase, isn't it?

European Entrepreneur of the Year.

That's impressive.

Dave. Did you g.. g.. get my cuttings?

I did mate. It's in the greenhouse.

I got you a Caryopteris and a

Philadelphus.

Cheers man. Thank you.

See you later.

See you tomorrow.

Daddy? What did Papadopoulos & Sons

borrow for the property development?

About three hundred million.

Never mind the trials and tribulations

of the stock market. Finish your

supper young man.

Nanny P!

Eat up or there'll be no pudding. I've

made you a nice sponge.

Two, Four, Eight, 16...

Alright.

Thirty two, sixty four, 128..

That's enough.

Something is happening with interbank

lending Daddy!

Alright. We'll talk about it tomorrow.

It's going to be a long summer.

Taking them to a business awards

ceremony is hardly a family day out.

My suggestion was a cottage in Lyme

Regis.

Dave? I need to talk to you about

James. It's... Look, you really

should be doing that at the back.

Yeah. Sorry.

Look. Its. He needs to complete his

degree. And this gardening, the

horticulture, the plants.

Yeah, yeah.

It's a huge distraction.

I was just helping him out during the

holidays.

Well, I need him to complete his

studies and you're diverting his

attention. And frankly, it's not what

I pay you for.

Please don't be so churlish. You know,

if you were worked for my company

you'd probably be fired.

Yeah. Is there anything else?

No. That's it.

Goodnight Mr. Papadopoulos.

James.

W...

Relax.

Wa... wa...

Calm down.

Wa.. wa..

You need to learn how to... You really

need to learn how to express yourself

more calmly.

Wanker. (Beat) Wanker.

James? Can I come in?

It is not the strongest to survive,

nor the most intelligent but those

adaptable to change. Fascinating.

Charles Darwin. (Latching onto a

random plant) Ah. Look at that. (Beat)

And that's...

Did you know, that the average garden

contains over three and a half million

species?

No, I didn't.

Dad. I'm not going back to...

But it's only a year and then you've

got a law degree.

I've no intention of running P.. P..

Papadopoulos & Sons. I can't even

pronounce it.

Look. Finish your studies. The plants.

It's a hobby. Sure. Give yourself

options. You may change your mind

about the business. You know, there

are a lot of creative roles now in

business.

Like what?

Like marketing. Alright. Defer the

final year. Take a year out, why not?

Fine. But don't quit. Your mother

would have said the same.

Would she?

Well, your mother would probably have

said do what you feel was right but

I'd argue she was wrong. And then we'd

argue. Probably. And she'd win. That

was your mother. At least consider

deferring.

Okay. I'll consider deferring.

Yeah? Great. Great. So, there you are,

it's not a definitely not?

What's this one called?

It's an ivy.
