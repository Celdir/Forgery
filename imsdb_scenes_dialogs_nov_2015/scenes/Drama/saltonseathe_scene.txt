THE SALTON SEA by Tony Gayton

INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

A MAN recumbent on the bed, playing a TRUMPET, his white dress shirt

defaced by a flower of blood.  The room is ON FIRE all around him.

He is playing Miles Davis' moody, Spanish-influenced SAETA, a haunting

and lonely piece.

A DUFFLE BAG FULL OF MONEY ON THE BED.  The money burning, tiny flaming

pieces floating around the room.

A PHOTOGRAPH of a woman taped to the inside of a trumpet case. The

photo is on fire.  Only her smile remains.

A GREETING CARD on the floor, a teddy bear and the word,

CONGRATULATIONS! on the front.  The wind from the fire blows the card

open.  Inside, a BLACKENED BLOOD STAIN.

INT. LABORATORY - DAY

EXTREME CLOSE-UP of a glass pipette dripping a clear liquid into a

glass beaker.

INT. JAPANESE ZERO - DAY

A wide-eyed, jaw-grinding KAMIKAZE PILOT with a death-grip on the

STOCK BATTLE FOOTAGE - a Japanese Zero crashes into a battleship,

bursting into a ball of flames.

INT. HOUSE - DAY

A wide-eyed, June Cleaveresque housewife in a picture-perfect white

dress vacuums the floor of a picture-perfect house.

She attacks the same spot over and over again, one hand clutching the

vacuum, the other stiffly holding a cigarette.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

THE LEG OF THE BED rattling and bouncing loudly off the floor.

STOCK FOOTAGE - J.F.K. pumping the hand of NIKITA KRUSCHEV.

Kennedy talking animatedly.

EXT. TRUCK STOP PARKING LOT - NIGHT

A sleepy-eyed TRUCKER emerges from his tractor-trailer and approaches a

loitering HELL'S ANGELS-type.

INT.  TRACTOR-TRAILER - NIGHT

Kamikaze.

INT. PHARMACY - NIGHT

A CASHIER scanning container after container of COLD MEDICATION.

The cashier looks up at the aforementioned FREAK, a frozen grin

plastered on his face.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

TRACK DOWN the kitchen counter on various containers.

CONTINUE TRACKING to a series of BURNERS, BEAKERS and TUBING

The freaky cook sees something he doesn't like. His eyes widen.

EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT

As the structure explodes.

INT. PARTY HOUSE - UNKNOWN

Thick blankets and tinfoil taped over the windows.

A huge container of empty beer cans, washed and neatly arranged.

Lines of crystal meth on a mirror as precisely arranged as Nails as the

Nuremberg rally.

A GROUP OF TWEAKERS in the middle of a binge.

Two skinny women, NANCY and Teresa bent over a drawer-full of neatly

folded socks on the living room floor.  They stare at the drawer as if

they were pondering a Rembrandt.

They take the socks out and being rearranging them again.

Three guys squeezed onto a couch together: KUJO, JIMMY THE FINN and

CREEPER.  Kujo is talking a blue-streak.  He makes Dennis Leary took

mealy-mouthed.

Creeper and Jimmy stare straight ahead, clearly bugging.

And he does.

DANNY is sitting in an armchair.  He is the only one who looks tired.

He sits there, taking the scene in.

ALL SOUNDS FADE OUT

DANNY'S P.O.V. - SCANNING THE ROOM.  NO SOUND.  The girl's folding the

socks ... Kujo ranting on ... Creeper and Jimmy the Finn grinding their

jaws ... the BLANKETS AND TINFOIL ON THE WINDOWS.

BACK ON DANNY. He blinks lethargically.

Suddenly ...

INT. PARTY HOUSE - NIGHT

Danny and Jimmy the Finn walking towards the front door.

Danny nods.

EXT. PARTY HOUSE - DAY

As the door opens, Danny discovers that it is TWELVE NOON and the sun

is blazing.

The party house is revealed as a cheap stucco apartment building

crammed in the middle of BUSY BUSINESS DISTRICT at a major

intersection.

Jimmy and Danny slip on sunglasses and brave the light.

They slink along like two albino rat vampires with sunglasses.

INT. CHEAP MOTEL ROOM - DAY

Danny and Jimmy standing there looking at something OFF SCREEN.  Danny

and Jimmy looking at one another, then back at what they were looking

at.

A GUY sitting on the bed in his underwear, looking down at his left arm

and holding a can of BUG SPRAY at the ready in his right hand.

He is completely motionless, studying his arm with hypnotic intensity.

Bobby never takes his eyes off his arm.

Bobby readies the can of bug spray, his eyes widening.

Bobby lets loose with the spray, dousing his arm.

Bobby's mouth wide with stupid joy and continues to cloud the air with

bug spray.

Danny and Jimmy wait silently.  Bobby finally stops spraying, satisfied

he has killed the imaginary spiders.

He looks up at Jimmy and Danny, his eyes swimming with stupid, drug-

addled confusion.

Bobby squints.

Danny and Jimmy notice something simultaneously.

There is something under the mattress - A HUGE BULGE.

A MUFFLED MOAN from under Bobby.  She is between the mattress and the

box springs.

Bobby starts slapping the top of the mattress with his hand.  New

MUFFLED SCREAMS from underneath.

Bobby immediately stops.  Looks at Jimmy with incredulity.

Bobby springs from the bed, grabbing something as he rises.

Danny and Jimmy suddenly staring at a SPEARGUN which is loaded with two

stainless steel spears.

Bobby stands there alternately pointing the speargun at Jimmy, then

Danny.

Bobby nods towards something behind Danny.  Danny and Jimmy don't move

or speak.

Bobby rubs his nose.

Bobby tilts his head.

Bobby twists a smile, revealing speed-blackened teeth.

Bobby lowers his speargun.

Jimmy breaths a sigh of relief.

EXT. CHEAP MOTEL ROOM - DAY

Danny and Jimmy exit the room, closing the door behind them.  Danny

looks at Jimmy.

WHAP, WHAP! Two spears plunge through the cheap door, stopping inches

from Danny's head.

They run like hell.

EXT. SKY - DAY

TIME LAPSE.  The sun plunges down.  The sky turns black.  The moon

races up and down.  The sky lightens.  The sun races up and down.

Night comes again.

INT. PARTY HOUSE - NIGHT

Everyone crashing.  Jonestown, post Kool-Aid.  It looks like they have

all simultaneously fallen asleep where they were standing or sitting.

Danny stirs awake.  Looks around.  He stretches.  KNOCKING OVER A

BOTTLE OF BEER.

ALL OTHER SOUND FADES OUT AS the beer SPLATTER to the floor.  IT IS

UNNATURALLY LOUD.

DANNY staring intently at the spilling liquid.

The beer pools up on the floor.

Danny transfixed by the image.

The last few drops of beer LOUDLY splashing down.

EXT PAYPHONE - NIGHT

Danny on the phone.

He hangs up.

EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

Danny waiting in the shadows.

A car, sans headlights, pulls into the alley and stops.

Danny emerges from the shadows, opens the back door and lays on the

back seat.

INT. CAR - SAME

Two guys in suits in the front, TANNER and GARCETTI.  Tanner. blue eyes

and SHAVED HEAD, an air of ex-military around him.  Garcetti: swarthly

and serious, a MIASMA OF BAD-ASS ATTITUDE.

Tanner drives out of the alley.

EXT. PART - NIGHT

Danny, Tanner and Garcetti outside the car in a deserted park. Danny

pacing.

QUICK FLASHES OF BOBBY'S TATTOOS.

Garcetti produces something from the front seat of the car and trudges

over.

The humorless Garcetti hands Danny a "WANTED POSTER".  Bobby's mug shot

glaring.

FLASHBACK - INT. CHEAP MOTEL ROOM - DAY

Bobby's hand extracting the eightballs from a nylon bag full of meth.

QUICK SHOT of an open drawer.  A GUN can be glimpsed inside.

ANOTHER QUICK GLIMPSE of the closet.  A shotgun butt visable

The WOMAN'S HAND protruding from underneath the mattress.

A SILHOUETTE visible through a crack in the BATHROOM DOOR.

A BEAT-UP ELMO DOLL and SOME COLORING BOOKS on top of the dresser.

EXT. PARK - NIGHT

Back on Danny.

Garcetti looks at Danny with contempt.  They head back to the car.

Garcetti throws Danny up against the car.  Nose-to-nose.

Garcetti lets Danny go. Stomps off.

EXT. CHEAP MOTEL ROOM - DAY

A GAGGLE OF ONLOOKERS, including a NEWS CREW, watching from the parking

lot.

BOBBY'S WOMAN screaming at the top of her lungs as she tries to get a

Bobby's sheet-covered body.

A SWAT TEAM packing up nearby.  One of them suddenly does a graceful

little Tai-Chi gesture.

A LITTLE GIRL clutches at the screaming woman's legs.

REVEAL DANNY, amongst the onlookers.  His expression gives nothing

away.

A ribbon of blood snakes from Bobby's body, over the parking lot curb

and runs into a storm drain.

As the blood SPLATTERS to the bottom, mixing with a pool of filthy

water. THE SOUND IS UNNATURALLY LOUD.

INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL - GARDENA - NIGHT.

The place cries out "YOU HAVE FINALLY HIT THE ABSOLUTE BOTTOM!"

Danny exist the stairwell and approaches his door.

A WOMAN ONE DOOR DOWN FROM DANNY'S ROOM struggles with her groceries.

When she goes to open the door, one of the  bags breaks, spilling its

contents onto the floor.

Danny walks over.

She scoops up the groceries and hurries into her room.  Slamming the

door behind her.

There is a can on the floor.  Danny bends down to pick it up.

He looks at the can.

INSERT - CAN

The label is in CHINESE.

No reaction.

After a moment, the door swings open.  Danny is holding the can out

with a big smile on  his face.

The woman smiles.  A pretty smile.  Sad too.

She smiles again. World-weary.  Sweet. Those eyes.  Sad.  Sexy.  Sad

and sexy.

She closes the door abruptly.

INT. RESIDENTAL HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

The burning room from the opening scene.  Danny's dirty clothes on the

bed.

He emerges from the shower, a towel wrapped around his waist.  There is

a BIG STAR-SHAPED SCAR on Danny's shoulder.

He walks over to the closet, takes a METAL LOCKBOX from the top shelf

and puts it on the bed.

Pulls a key from his pocket and unlocks the box. He sits there staring

at the contents for a moment, then gingerly takes them out ...

... CLOTHES.  A white dress shirt, black slacks and wingtips.

INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Danny dresses in his clothes, combing his hair.  He goes back in the

lock box and pulls something else out ...

... A TRUMPET CASE.  He walks over to the cheap vanity and sits down in

front of the mirror and stars for a very long time.

He slowly opens the trumpet case revealing a GLEAMING HORN inside.

Runs his fingers along the length of it and up to ...

... A PHOTO OF A WOMAN taped to the inside of the lid.  A self-

conscious smile on her face like she's uncomfortable with having her

picture taken.

He takes the trumpet from the case - A CHECK from a LIFE INSURANCE

COMPANY and a DRIVER'S LICENSE with Danny's picture and the name TOM

VAN ALLEN.

He starts to play.  "Saeta" again.

AN IMAGE appears on THE BLANK WALL BESIDE HIM.  MOVE OFF DANNY AND UP

TO THE IMAGE.

IN THE IMAGE - A HUGE LAKE in the middle of the DESERT.  CONTINUE

MOVING IN ON IMAGE AS WE CUT TO ...

EXT. SALTON SEA - SUNSET (FLASHBACK)

Danny and THE WOMAN FROM THE PHOTOGRAPH sitting on the shore.  Watching

the sunset. She is his wife, LIZ.

Danny playing "SAETA" on his trumpet.

Danny and Liz are alone, except for the myriad birds, silhouetted by

the falling sun.

A gust of wind rushes across the lake, blowing Liz's hair all around

her face.

A dying fish on the waterline, gills pumping for oxygen.

Danny finishes playing.

Silence.

IMPORTANT: DANNY WILL BE KNOWN AS TOM IN THIS SCENE.

Danny playfully tackles her to the ground.

Danny starts kissing her over and over again.

She finally pushes him off.  He rolls off of her and snuggles up next

to her, spooning her in the sand.

Liz smiles, snuggles closer to Danny.

INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Danny sitting at the vanity holding the trumpet.  THE IMAGE IS STILL

PROJECTED ON THE WALL BEHIND HIM.

NOW THE DANNY IN THE IMAGE ANSWERS ....

BACK ON THE IMAGE as Danny and Liz walk away from the shore.

The sun sinks completely below the horizon.

A long fish hawk floats on the last of the thermals.

The dying fish breaths its last.

Danny (at the vanity) closes his eyes.

SERIES OF QUICK CUTS

The trumpet goes back in the case.

The lid is closed.

The case goes back in the box.

The neatly folded clothes are laid on top.

The box goes back to the shelf.

The light in the closet is turned off.

Tanner writing serial numbers down as he counts out SEVERAL HUNDRED

DOLLAR BILLS.

slides it over to Danny, who doesn't touch it.

The envelope lays there between them for the following conversation.

Danny smiles.

Tanner shakes his head and smiles.

Danny stuffs the money into his jacket.

Garcetti emerges from the men's room, zipping up.

Garcetti sits down next to Danny. Sighs.

Garcetti puts his hand on Danny's shoulder, really playing it up.

Danny turns to Tanner

Danny paces back and forth.

Garcetti chuckles at Danny's fear

EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

Danny sitting cross-legged in front of a gravestone.

A PICKUP TRUCK slowly winds its way up the access road towards Danny.

Danny stands up.  Dusts his pants off.

The truck stops nearby.  The strains of GARTH BROOKS from inside.

Danny approaches.  The passenger's side window rolls down revealing ...

... A BAD-ASSED ASIAN DUDE behind the wheel. He wears a cowboy hat and

a rodeo belt.  He looks like the Chinese Marlboro man.  This is BUBBA.

An AIRBRUSH painting on the door panel - a bad likeness of Bubba

astride a horse, dressed as a cowboy with a huge-breasted Pamela

Anderson-type on the saddle behind him.

Bubba fires up a cigarette, revealing a pock-marked face. He carries a

gun in a tooled leather shoulder holster.

Danny climbs in.  The window goes back up.  As the care pulls away, we

...

... MOVE back over to the gravestone.

The stone reads: "ELIZABETH VAN ALLEN.  BELOVED WIFE"

EXT. THE CINDER BLOCK BAR - NIGHT

A non-descript. cinder block bar.  No windows.  No frills.

INT. CINDER BLOCK BAR - SAME

Danny sitting at the bar, nursing a drink.  He looks nervous, eyes

darting around for potential assassins.

He has nothing to worry about with this crowd, harmless alcoholics all.

Jimmy The Finn enters and approaches Danny.  Danny signals for Jimmy to

go to the back, then gets up and follows him, carrying two beers.

Jimmy has dark circles under his eyes.

Jimmy sighs, scratches his arms.  They are all scabbed up.

Danny chuckles.

Jimmy finishes his beer.  Danny signals to the cocktail waitress for

more beer.

Danny smiles at Jimmy's choice of words.

The beers arrive.  Jimmy lays into his, downing it in one long gulp.

Danny slides his over.

Jimmy shakes his head in wonder.

Jimmy frowns.

Jimmy's a drug-addled eyes catch a glimmer.

Jimmy sucks what's left of his beer down.

Jimmy becomes paralyzed by the math.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Danny walking home.  Sparse traffic on the street. He walks with his

head down and his hands thrust in his pockets.

A RED CAR approaches from the opposite direction. It SLOWS as it passes

Danny.

Danny looks over.

The DRIVER is obscured by the reflected glare of a streetlight, but it

is obvious that he is staring right at Danny.

Danny plays it cool. Keeps walking.

The red car pulls a SLOW U-TURN.

Danny hauls ass.

The red car catching up.

7Danny runs down a service street which runs through the back of a

series of apartment complexes.

The red car follows, slowly prowling the street.

Danny squeezed behind a dumpster, watching.

It is now too dark to see the driver.  The car comes to a stop.

Danny hugging the dumpster tight.

Another car pulls into the tight street, behind the red car.  The

driver of the other car SOUNDS HIS HORN.  The red car speeds off.

Danny walks quickly the other way.

INT. BARE APARTMENT - NIGHT

A WAY-TOO-YOUNG BLACK KID stares DIRECTLY AT CAMERA, an ARRAY OF

HANDGUNS, KNIVES, RIFLES AND SECURITY EQUIPMENT spread out on the

dining room table before him.

He is squeezed into a terry-cloth jumpsuit, his body festooned with

gold jewelry, his hair all wet jerry-curl.

He looks like Barry White, Jr.

The kid speaks in a HUSKY MONOTONE, completely FLAT and HUMORLESS.  He

sounds like one of those kids selling candy door-to-door with a

memorized pitch told by rote.

He finishes .... staring at ...

Danny and Jimmy, standing there, wide-eyed and amazed by the incredible

sales pitch.

EXT. BAD NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

Rows of decaying stucco apartment buildings.  Danny and Jimmy walking

EXT. POOH-BEAR'S COMPOUND - DAY

A sprawling old ranch house tucked into the remote hills of the desert.

A GUY passes out in the front yard.  A DOG sniffs at him, then starts

pissing on him.  He never moves.

A PILE OF DEAD PIGEONS near the driveway.

CLOSE ON POOH-BEAR - he does indeed have a prosthetic nose.  It almost

blends in with his face but not quite, making it that much more

disconcerting.

He takes a huge hit of crystal meth from a pipe, holds it, then blows a

long exhale.

A REMOTE CONTROLLED CAR trundles out of the garage and along the

driveway. Inside the car, FOUR PIEGEONS, their bodies wrapped in tape.

the bar.

Danny, Jimmy, Kujo and Creeper sitting in a booth.

Jimmy and Creeper are amped, jaws grinding, eyes bugging.

Kujo rambles on but Danny isn't listening. He looks exhausted, his face

is pinched, there are bags under his eyes.  He scans the bar, stopping

on ...

... Colette AND HER TRASHY DUDE BOYFRIEND

Colette sees Danny looking.  Smiles at him.  Danny returns the smile

until the trashy dude looks over.  Danny looks away.

breaking down into a karate stance.

She looks up. That face. Those eyes. Everything about her says "Get

involved."

INT. COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT

Danny and Colette in a near-deserted retro coffee shop.

A LONE WAITRESS AND COOK mull behind the counter.

Tanner takes out a pair of black leather gloves.

Tanner approaches him.  Danny backs into a corner.

Garcetti is mum.  Tanner raises his fists.  Danny covers his face.

Tanner starts swinging but SOMETHING UNEXPECTED ...

TANNER HITS LIKE A WIMP.

The punches have absolutely no effect.

Danny can't help it.  HE STARTS LAUGHING.  Tanner throws some more

creampuffs.

Garcetti shakes his head with shame.

This makes Tanner even madder. His punches become wilder and even less

effective.

Garcetti tires of the whole show.  He pulls a small SHOCK GUN from his

pocket, switches it on and sticks Danny behind the neck with it.

Danny crumples to the floor.  Tanner kicks him in the face.

Garecetti squats down next to Danny.

wall vent in the other room.

Bubba listens intently.

Danny approaching the building, we hear shots ...

... THE RED CAR from earlier, prowling the streets.  Danny ducks into a

liquor store and watches from the window.

The red car cruises slowly past.

DANNY lying on the bed, reliving the moment.  THE IMAGE STILL PROJECTED

ON THE WALL.

But the DANNY IN THE IMAGE never answers.

INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM - DAY

It is raining buckets outside.  Danny sleeping soundly.

The roof of Danny's room is leaking, PUDDLING UP ON THE FLOOR NEAR HIS

BED.

Danny's eyes pop open. He lays there rigidly.  LISTENING TO THE WATER.

ALL OTHER SOUND FADES OUT AS THE WATER PATTERS AND PUDDLE ON THE FLOOR.

IT IS UNNATURALLY LOUD.

INT. CINDER BLOCK BAR - NIGHT

The bar is almost empty.

Danny quietly playing chords on a beat-up old upright piano in the back

of the room - the through-line of Davis' "All Blues."

Danny looks up.

Colette sits down on the piano bench next to Danny.

He continues. She sits there listening for a few moments.

Danny continues to play.

Colette slides closer.

She pulls even closer.

She goes to kiss him. Danny stops playing. Pulls away from her.

She puts her hand on his leg.

He moves his leg away.

He closes the keyboard cover.

INT. CAR - DAY

Still raining.  Tanner negotiates the slow traffic.

Danny looking at a MUG SHOT OF POOH-BEAR.

Danny doesn't look reassured.

Garcetti and Tanner exchange a smile.

Danny's eyes dart back and forth between Garcetti and Tanner.

Garcetti and Tanner break out laughing.

Danny reacts to the name, not listening to the rest of what Garcetti

and Tanner have to say.

Danny lost in thought.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Danny waiting on the corner.

Jimmy's Vega sputters to a stop in front of Danny.  Jimmy gets out and

hands Danny the keys.

ON THE BUMPTER, a hand-made sign. It reads: PULL ME OVER. I DARE YOU!

Danny sighs. Walks to the back, rips the sign off and gets in the car,

leaving Jimmy with the sign.

Danny burns rubber.

EXT. POOH-BEAR'S COMPOUND - NIGHT

Danny being led towards a trailer by TWO OF POOH-BEAR'S MEN. LITTLE

BILL AND BIG BILL. Little Bill is big and Big Bill is little.

INT. HOUSE - SAME

Pooh-Bear sitting in a recliner, obscured by shadows when Danny and his

escorts enter.

A WIRE CAGE IN THE CORNER, SOMETHING MOVING AROUND INSIDE.  It too is

obscured by shadows.

Pooh-Bear doesn't look up. He is preoccupied with something in his hand

which he is cleaning with a toothbrush.

Pooh-Bear doesn't respond. Continues brushing.

Danny closes his eyes. Not what he wanted to hear.

Danny looks to the two Bills for help.

Big Bill pulls a 19th century double-barreled FLINTLOCK PISTOL from his

jacket and points it at Danny's head.

Little Bill drops Danny's trousers.  Danny about to object when he is

started into silence.

The saturnine Pooh-Bear raises his head, illuminating his face.  He

isn't wearing his prosthetic nose.  A GAPING HOLE WHERE HIS NOSE SHOULD

BE.  He looks like some obscene human bat.

Pooh-Bear holds up the plastic nose he has been cleaning, inspecting it

under the light.

He pops his nose back into place, but it goes on crooked.

The Bills escort Danny over to the cage.  There is A GIGANTIC CRAZED

WEASEL INSIDE.

The cage is divided by a large piece of Plexiglas.

The weasel is foaming at the mouth.

Pooh-Bear holds up his hand.

He points to the cage.   Danny looks down at the weasel, which is

trying to gnaw through the Plexiglas.

The weasel continues to gnaw.

There is a hole in the top of the cage on the opposite side of the

Plexiglas from Captain Steubing.

Big Bill pulls back the hammer on the gun.

Danny's eyes dart quickly over to Little Bill, who like everyone else,

is watching the weasel.

Little Bill is wearing a big, filthy pea coat with A LARGE TEAR on the

side.

Danny still hasn't complied with Pooh-Bear's order.

From behind, we see Danny bend slightly, dropping his privates into the

cage.

Danny tries to stay calm, shoots another look at Little Bill who is

standing right next to him.

Pooh-Bear leans forward and opens the Plexiglas partition about half an

inch.

THE WEASEL bolts for the opening, gnashing its teeth, trying to squirm

through.

The weasel squirms and squeals and bangs against the Plexiglas.

Danny uses the diversion.  He quickly TAKES SOMETHING from him own

jacket pocket and SLIPS IT IN THE HOLE IN LITTLE BILL'S JACKET between

the coat and the lining.

No one notices.

Pooh-Bear opens the Plexiglas even more.  The weasel is able to get his

head through the hole.  He bares his filthy teeth.

He nods towards Little Bill.  Pooh-Bear cocks his head.

Danny now makes eye contact with Pooh-Bear, who listens intently.

Pooh-Bear rises slowly.  Approaches the triumvirate.

Danny keeps one eye on ...

... the weasel as it continues its assault on the opening.

Pooh-Bear pulls a chrome .45 from his waistband.

Pooh-Bear limply aims the .45 at Little Bill.

Big Bill checks all of Little Bill's pockets, coming up empty.

The weasel has squeezed about a third of the way through the hole.

Danny, panicked, eyes the hole in the pea coat.

Danny can't believe it.  But when Little Bill lowers his arms, a big

roll of cash protrudes from the hole.

Pooh-Bear and Big Bill see it immediately.

He follows their gaze to the cash.

Danny extracts himself from the cage just as ...

... the weasel bolts through the opening and springs for the hold in

the cage.

Danny looks at the shrine to Liz on top of the piano.

He pockets the check and the license, closes the lockbox and goes over

to the door.

Colette standing on the other side.  Her FACE AND ARMS ARE BLACK AND

BLUE WITH BRUISES.

He lets her come in.  Colette looks away.

Colette cracks a crooked smile.

Danny smiles.  He gently touches her eye.  Colette reaches up and

touches Danny's bruised eye.

Colette leans in to kiss him, but they bump bad eyes.

They kiss again.  Deep and long.  Danny suddenly pulls back mid-kiss.

Colette goes to touch him. He pulls away.

Danny paces uncomfortably.

Colette comes to a slow realization.

THE FLASHBACK IMAGERY suddenly FLICKERS TO LIFE on the wall behind

Danny - THE MOONLIGH SALTON SEA.

Danny freezes.  Looks up at Colette.

Colette waits a beat, then turns to leave.

Danny finishes up.  He steps up onto the tub and peaks out the bathroom

window.

THROUGH THE WINDOW - TWO FIGURES CROSS IN FRONT OF THE HEADLIGHTS OF

THE CAR.  THE ENGINE REMAINS RUNNING.

Danny frowns, not sure what to make of it.  He steps down from the tub

and is just about to exit when THE FRONT DOORS IS KICKED OPEN AND SHOTS

ARE FIRED.

VOICES SHOUTING.

Danny freezes, not sure what to do. His eyes dart around for a weapon.

He picks up a large plumber's wrench and goes to the bathroom door.

MORE SHOTS.  SEMI-AUTOMATIC FIRE.

SEVERAL BULLETS slam through the bathroom wall, one striking Danny in

the shoulder.

He slumps to the floor.

THE PANDEMONIUM continues in the front room.

There is a BULLET HOLE about the size of a fifty cent piece in the wall

next to Danny's head.  He puts his eye to the hole and looks out.

DANNY'S P.O.V. THROUGH THE HOLE - scanning the room.  Stopping on ...

... LIZ. In the confusion, she has managed to hide from the intruders.

She is squeezed into a tiny space between the sofa and the wall.  She

clings tightly to the curtains, her hands shaking violently.

ONE THE CURTAIN RINGS - pulled taught by Liz's grip.

Danny adjusts his gaze through the hole.

start to head out the front door when ...

ON DANNY - freaking. His eyes shooting back to Liz.

SILENCE.

Listening.

Then the CREAKING FOOTSTEPS of Intruder One approaching. It takes an

eternity.

Liz can't possibly see Danny through the hole but it looks like she is

staring directly at him, her body rigid with fear.

Danny grabs the wrench again.  Tries to get to his feet but slips back

down, either too weak from loss of blood or just plain scared.  His

hand is shaking violently.

He looks through the hole again.

THROUGH THE HOLE - Liz still staring at Danny. THE FOOTSTEPS CONTENCE

at a agonizing slow pace, then stop.

A GUN, ever so slowly, enters FRAME. EXTREME CLOSE UP on Liz's eyes as

they widen.

EXTREME CLOSE UP on Danny's eye peering through the hole. A SHOT IS

FIRED. His eye closes.

ON DANNY-his mouth opens to scream BUT NOTHING COMES OUT.

THE LIQUID SOUND BECOMES LOUDER AND LOUDER UNTIL IT IS ALL THAT CAN BE

HEARD.

Liz is still in her hiding place behind the end of the couch.  Her head

is resting comfortably on the arm of the couch.  She looks fine.  There

is even a slight smile on her lips.

Then he notices it ...

... a widening pool of BLOOD seeps from under the couch like some

living thing.  More blood patters down from some UNSEEN WOUND on the

side of her head.

Tanner frowns.

Danny raises his gun.

Danny shoots Tanner in the shoulder.  He collapses to the floor.

ON GARCETTI - his eyes flutter and open.

Danny walks over to Tanner and stands above him.

Tanner looks at Danny, confused.

Tanner realizes what Danny is talking about.

Tanner doesn't answer.

Still no answer.

Tanner is ghost white, loosing blood quickly.

When Danny goes to shoot Tanner again ...

... Tanner pulls a K-BAR KNIFE from the back of his belt and plunges it

into the back of Danny's gun hand.  The gun discharges, missing Tanner.

Danny drops the gun.  Tanner snatches it up.

Tanner immediately has the gun inches from Danny's head.  Danny freezes

...

Danny looks up at the gun, his face a blank.

CLOSE ON THE BARREL OF THE GUN.  ALL SOUND FADES OUT.

MOVE INTO THE BARREL OF THE GUN.  THE BLACK KID'S FACE APPEARS INSIDE.

QUICK FLASHES of all the shots Danny fired with the Glock.

- TWO at Big Bill

- FOUR at the guys at the table

- ONE at Garcetti

- THREE  at Tanner

THE KID AGAIN.

ON DANNY.  Still staring at the gun. He knows the gun is empty. He

notices something on the floor ...

... THE LOADED SYRINGE.

Danny trying to remember.

DANNY starts chuckling. Looks up at Tanner.

Danny looks down at the syringe again.  Tanner sees it too.

Danny picks up the syringe.

Tanner pulls the trigger.

INSIDE THE GUN - MOVING SLOWLY towards the firing pin as it springs

forward toward CAMERA with a LOUD CLICK.

THE GUN IS EMPTY.

Danny jams the SYRINGE INTO TANNER'S THROAT all the way down to the

plunger, dosing him with the meth.

Tanner goes down, blood bubbling from his throat around the syringe.

His eyes roll back as he  convulses from the drugs.

Danny struggles to his feet.

Tanner quivers from head to toe like some freaked-out Pentecostal in

the throws of a holy possession.

Danny pulls the syringe from Tanner's throat.  A LONG WET WEEZE

ESCAPES.

Suddenly, A NOISE BEHIND DANNY.

Garcetti standing there pointing his gun at Danny, rocking slightly

back and forth, a bullet hole in his cheekbone.  He looks brain dead.

Danny doesn't move. TANNER STILL WHEEZING.

Garcetti looks like he wants to shoot his gun, but can't.  He keeps

looking down at his hand, trying to get it to obey.

Danny calmly walks over and takes the gun from Garcetti.

Garcetti puts his hand to his nose and blows out a clot of blood.  He

looks down at his hand.

He has hacked up the bullet he was shot with.

Garcetti smiles an embarrassed smile at Danny.  TANNER'S WHEEZING

CONTINUES.

Garcetti nods slightly.  He goes to a kneeling position, then curls up

on the floor like he is taking a nap and dies.

Danny goes over to the couch and sits down.

Danny with his head in his hands, emotionally and physically exhausted.

TANNER WHEEZING LOUDER AND LOUDER.

CLOSE ON DANNY'S FACE.  Blank.  Devoid of anything.  He stuffs

Garcetti's gun into his own mouth, hand shaking.

He takes the gun out.

Stuffs it back in again, shoving it way down, almost gagging on it.

The barrel clatters against his teeth. He takes it out again.  THE

WHEEZING CONTINUES.

Danny starts crying.  Lifts the gun halfway again, then drops it.

He jumps up.  Goes over to the still-wheezing Tanner and empties his

clip into him.  When the clip is spent, Danny keeps pulling the trigger

... over and over again.

He stands there pulling the trigger again and again and again and

again.

INT. RESIDENTIAL HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Danny dressed in his "Tom" clothes. He limps over to the bed and picks

up the trumpet case.  Carries it over to the mirror.

Danny staring at his reflection. He lights a cigarette.

Danny smiles.

He turns.

COLETTE and QUINCEY standing there.  Quincey holds a nine millimeter

with a muzzle suppressor.

He shoots Danny in the stomach.  Danny slumps to the floor.  His

cigarette falls out of his mouth and rolls under the bed.

Colette freaks.

She tries to go to Danny but Quincey stops her.

Danny looks at them, confused, a blood stain blossoming on his white

shirt.

Quincey holds up the baggie of drugs.

Danny looks from Quincey to Colette.  Colette looks away.

UNDER THE BED - the cigarette smoldering on the carpet.

Quincey looks at Colette

Danny looks at Colette, dumbfounded.

Danny can't help from laughing at the irony.  Beads of sweat are

forming on his blanched face.  He looks at Colette with a wry smile.

Danny looks down at his bloody stomach.

Danny stares at her, not sure what to believe.  He looks over at

Quincey.

Quincey shakes his head.

Danny looks at Colette, imagining the awful beating she must have

taken.

UNDER THE BED - THE CARPET IGNITES.  The fire spreads quickly.

Quincey grabs her arm.

The drapes go up in flames.  Quincey puts the gun to the back of her

head.

The fire continues to spread.  Colette kisses Danny on the lips.

Quincey pulls her away.

Collette looks back one last time just as the flames reach the door,

cutting off any escape.

Danny breathing hard. He gets up.  Staggers over to the mirror where

his trumpet is.

He opens the case and takes the trumpet out.

He plops down on the bed and BLOWS A FEW NOTES. He stops for a second,

a smile on his lips.

He starts to play SAETA.

INT. BURNING ROOM - NIGHT

Back to the opening scene.  The whole room ablaze.  Danny lying on the

bed, playing the horn.

Pieces of the roof start falling in.

He stops playing.

He closes his eyes.

He drops his trumpet and lays his head back.

BLACK SCREEN

THEN BLURRY, VAGUE SLOW MOTION - moving through the flames.

CLOSE ON DANNY'S HEAD - seemingly floating through the fiery room.

Emerging from the flames into a dark hallway.

Danny's eyes flutter as he seemingly continues to float.

A linoleum floor rushes underneath.

Danny head sags, finds himself staring at ...

...  A TATTOED LIKENESS OF HIMSELF.  The tattoo smiles and speaks.

Stairs rush by underneath.  Then another hallway.

DANNY'S P.O.V.  - a bright white light at the end of the hall.

On Danny's face, floating through the hall.  His eyes fluttering.

MOVING TOWARDS the light.  Closer.  Closer.

Danny's eyes close, his head droops.

CLOSE ON DANNY as his eyes flutter and open.

DANNY'S P.O.V. - an image slowly coming into focus ...

... JIMMY staring down at him with concern.

Danny blinks his eyes again.  Looks up at ...

... A PARAMEDIC working on him.

Danny smiles a weak smile at Jimmy.

Jimmy just sits there, nodding his head, a big shit-eating grin on his

face.

The paramedic continues to work on Danny.  His eyes slowly close.

EXT. THE CITY - DAY

Danny exits a cab and heads towards a coffee shop.  He looks like a new

man.

Danny looks through the window of the shop.

Colette inside, working the counter, pouring coffee.

Danny enters the shop.

INT. COFFE SHOP - SAME

Danny takes a seat at the counter.  Colette turns and sees him.

They stare at one another for a beat, then smile.  Colette pours him

some coffee.

They strike up a conversation as we ...

THE END
