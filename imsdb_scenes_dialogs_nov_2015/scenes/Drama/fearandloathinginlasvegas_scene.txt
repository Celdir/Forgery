FEAR & LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS

BLACK SCREEN

A desert wind moans sadly.  From somewhere within the wind

comes the tinkly, syrupy-sweet sounds of the Lennon Sisters

singing "My Favorite Things." A series of sepia images of

anti-war protests from the mid-sixties appear one after

another on the screen.

In the violently scrawled style of Ralph Steadman, the title

FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS splashes onto the screen.  A

beat, and then it runs down and off revealing:

TITLE: "He who makes a beast of himself

The VOICE OF HUNTER S. THOMPSON -- a.k.a. RAOUL DUKE:

AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!

A red Chevy convertible -- THE RED SHARK -- wipes the black

screen.

EXT. ON THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY

AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!

THE RED SHARK races down the desert highway at a hundred

miles an hour.  THE STONES' "Sympathy For the Devil" blares.

AT THE WHEEL

STRANGELY STILL AND TENSE, RAOUL DUKE DRIVES -- SKELETAL,

BEER IN HAND -- STARES STRAIGHT AHEAD.

BESIDE HIM, FACE TURNED TO THE SUN, EYES CLOSED BEHIND

WRAPAROUND SPANISH SUNGLASSES, IS HIS SWARTHY AND UNNERVINGLY

UNPREDICTABLE ATTORNEY, DR. GONZO.

The music pounds DUKE stares straight ahead.  GONZO froths

up a can of beer - uses it as shaving foam.

GONZO starts shaving.

Close on DUKE -- shadows flutter across his face.  The

reflections of bats swirl within his eyes.  We push in close

to one eye ball -- SCREECHING SWIRLING BAT-LIKE SHAPES!

AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!

CUT TO WIDE SHOT OF CAR -

DUKE, eyes rigid, flails at the air.  No bats anywhere.

GONZO casually looks over...

DUCK SCREECHES to the side of the road.  The sudden wrench

makes GONZO nick his face with his razor.

DUKE hops out of the car, keeping an eye out for bats,

frantically opens the trunk to reveal what looks like A

MOBILE POLICE NARCOTICS LAB.  DUKE desperately rifles

through the impressive stash.

DUKE, eyes darting madly as he hears what sounds like the

SHRIEKS OF BATS returning, grabs an assortment along with

another six-pack of beer - slams the trunk shut and dives

back into the car.

THE RED SHARK RACES INTO THE DISTANCE... on the ground,

weakly flapping is a SEMI-SQUASHED, SLOWLY DYING ANIMAL... A

BAT?

EXT. FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY

IN THE RED SHARK

GONZO grips the wheel - stares maniacally down the road - a

lousy driver.

The radio news wars with "SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL" on a tape

recorder.

GONZO changes the station - "ONE TOKE OVER THE LINE, SWEET

JESUS, ONE TOKE OVER THE LINE" vies with "SYMPATHY"... He

sings along - washes a couple of pills back with a new beer.

The RED SHARK fishtails.

UP AHEAD - AT THE SIDE OF THE DESERTED ROAD

A LONE HITCHHIKER spots them, jumps up and sticks out a

thumb.  The RED SHARK roars past.  Then, fifty yards down

the road...

GONZO wrenches the wheel - THE RED SHARK swerves to the side

of the road.

GONZO JAMS THE CAR INTO REVERSE AND ROCKETS BACKWARDS.  The

HITCHHIKER races to the car.  A poor OKIE KID with a big grin.

Then the big grin freezes on the OKIE KID's face at the

sight of: DUKE and GONZO looking out at him with HYPER-

NORMAL, shit-eating SMILES.

The HITCHHIKER hesitates.

DUKE turns back to the HITCHHIKER - smiles reassuringly.

EXT. EVEN FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY

The HITCHHIKER sits nervously in the back seat as the RED

SHARK screams down the road.

GONZO sings along to the tape player.

The HITCHHIKER's eyes go to the door - considers jumping out

and taking his chances.

DUKE, sweating bullets, STARES AT THE HITCHHIKER in the rear

view mirror.

The HITCHHIKER's eyes notice a thin line of blood trickling

down GONZO's neck.

DUKE's mouth moves intermittently - sometimes in sync with

the words, sometimes not.

DUKE gives the HITCHHIKER a FINE BIG GRIN and the HITCHHIKER

giggles nervously.

The HITCHHIKER stares at him, not blinking.

The HITCHHIKER nods -- giggles -- terrified.  DUKE climbs

into the back seat.

The CAR SWERVES SICKENINGLY, then straightens out.

The HITCHHIKER makes a sudden lunge for freedom.  DUKE GRABS

HIM BACK DOWN.

The HITCHHIKER STRUGGLES IN PANIC.

INT. THE BEVERLY WILLS HOTEL POGO LOUNGE 1971 - DAY

A uniformed DWARF, carries a shockingly PINK TELEPHONE

through the glittering, tranquil POGO LOUNGE CROWD.  They

are the ELOI.  HENDRIX AFROS and DROOPING MUSTACHES and BELL

BOTTOMS and LOVE BEADS and BELLS.  ACTRESSES sip Singapore

Slings and PROMOTERS sip ACTRESSES in this MONIED, SANITISED

VERSION OF THE GREAT REVOLUTION YEARS.

The DWARF reaches DUKE -- T-shirt, levis, sneakers and

shades.  GONZO -- white rayon bellbottoms and a khaki tank

top undershirt.  They are in the middle of a serious

conversation.

The DWARF sneers.

DUKE lifts the receiver -- listens...

DUKE hangs up the PHONE with the DEAD-PAN EXPRESSION OF A

MOVIE SPY.

GONZO, says nothing for a moment, then POUNDS the table!

DUKE and GONZO are up and off.  The DWARF chases after them

with the (very large) check in his hand.

They sweep out through the Lounge door, unaware of it

swinging back into the face of the pursuing DWARF.

EXT. BEVERLY WILLS HOTEL - FRONT ENTRANCE - DAY

DUKE and GONZO emerge.

Their car arrives -- rusted out, smashed door panels.  They

jump in.

And they're off in a cloud of black exhaust as the nose-

bleeding DWARF stumbles out with the unpaid bill in his hand.

EXT. SUNSET BLVD - DAY

The PINTO races through shot.

EXT. POLYNESIAN BAR - DAY

The PINTO skids to a halt outside Polynesian bar, the back

window full of Hawaiian shirts.

INT. POLYNESIAN BAR - DAY

TORN YELLOW PAGES with dealer's ads ticked off lie in a pile

as GONZO yells into a PAYPHONE.  DUKE carries over four

Singapore Slings.

EXT. SUNSET BLVD - DUSK

The PINTO races down street.

EXT. SUNSET BLVD - TRAFFIC JAM - DUSK

They're stuck in a traffic jam -- clouds of exhaust.  DUKE

BANGS ON THE HORN IN FURY.

Directly in front of them: BLOODY CARNAGE -- a covered

corpse is loaded into an ambulance by PARAMEDICS.

EXT. CAR RENTAL AGENCY - NIGHT

Behind the wheel of the RED SHARK: DUKE grins with

satisfaction -- checking it out.  A nervous AGENT holds out

a clipboard.  DUKE signs without looking at the rental papers.

DUKE throws the car into reverse -- roars backwards past the

gas pumps to where GONZO is unloading their rusted out car.

GONZO transfers boxes of new sound equipment and a large box

of rum and ice into the RED SHARK.

He JAMS the car into LOW GEAR and lurches into traffic.  The

AGENT runs into the street and helplessly watches them go.

EXT. RUNDOWN BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT

STRANGE AND MAGICAL.  In the moonlight: the silhouetted

figures of DUKE and GONZO as they pack the RED SHARK.

The surf crashes in the distance...

EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - NIGHT

DUKE cries out as he dives into the ocean.  He lets himself

float up through the silvery bubbles...

DUKE AND GONZO FLOAT BEATIFICALLY IN THE GLOWING, SHIMMERING

MOONLIT SURF.

EXT. AND EVEN FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY

DUKE's intense face.

The HITCHHIKER nods -- giggles -- petrified.

GONZO clutches his heart.  The car veers off the road and

screeches to a halt.  He slumps over the wheel.

DUKE spills out 4 AMYL CAPSULES from a tin.

DUKE and GONZO break 2 AMYLS apiece -- INHALE DEEPLY.  GONZO

falls back on the seat, staring straight up at the sun.  The

HITCHHIKER looks petrified.

GONZO pulls out a .357 Magnum -- waves it around.

GONZO cracks ANOTHER AMYL.

The HITCHHIKER SCRAMBLES OUT OF THE CAR, DOWN THE TRUNK LID,

AND FLEES.

The HITCHHIKER RUNS from car.

DUKE glances back at the running HITCHHIKER.

DUKE GUNS THE RED SHARK -- TAKES OFF DOWN THE ROAD...

EXT. UNBELIEVABLY FAR DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY

THE RED SHARK races -- DUKE at the wheel -- straight ahead

driving.

GONZO wrestles with a shaker of COCAINE.  The top comes off

and the powder swirls away on the wind.

GONZO tears up a BLOTTER OF ACID.

DUKE takes his half -- chews it.

The RED SHARK screams along the highway past a billboard:

"DON'T GAMBLE WITH MARIJUANA! \ IN NEVADA: POSSESSION - 20

YEARS; SALE - LIFE!!"

EXT. LAS VEGAS MINT HOTEL - DUSK

The RED SHARK pulls up outside the MINT.  A great banner

spanning the street announces the MINT 400.

DUKE can feel the drug surging up inside him.  Clutching a

buckled beer can, sweat pouring, he stares fixedly at the

TICKET the ATTENDANT gives him.

DUKE stares -- losing it...

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

DUKE waits in line at the front desk -- RIGID WITH PENT UP

ENERGY.  GONZO's ahead of him -- muscling in -- trying to

queue jump and failing.

A COUPLE move off and DUKE jerks forward -- stops -- eyes

fixed on the stony FEMALE RESERVATIONS CLERK.

DUKE moves ANOTHER RIGID STEP CLOSER to the desk -- the

tension almost snapping him in two.  GONZO's FLAPPING

AROUND -- absolutely no success.

Something catches DUKE's eye... He REMAINS ROOTED -- his

eyes turning to the VEGETAL PAISLEY PATTERNS ON THE CARPET

WHICH ARE SHIFTING -- UNDULATING.  THE CARPET PATTERNS ARE

INEXORABLY CREEPING UP THE WALLS...

The LAST PEOPLE leave -- with A FINAL, STIFF MOVE, DUKE

comes face to face with the RESERVATIONS CLERK... AND

EXPLODES!

As DUKE stares at her, BABBLING, her FACE BEGINS TO MORPH.

He tries to stop it happening by TALKING FASTER.

DUKE sags -- grips the desk -- WHITE KNUCKLES.

Her face is CHANGING -- SWELLING -- PULSING...

The FACE OF THE RESERVATIONS CLERK TURNS GREEN & GROWS FANGS.

DEADLY POISON!  DUKE LUNGES BACK at GONZO, who GRIPS his arm

intensely -- REACHES OUT to take the ENVELOPE.

GONZO manoeuvres DUKE away from the desk.  DUKE looks

back -- the RESERVATIONS CLERKS is now a MORAY EEL -- green

jowls and fangs.

INT. NAUTICAL BAR - DAY

The bar -- OILY PEOPLE -- quiet music -- nautical theme.

DUKE and GONZO at the bar, a marlin spike hanging on the

wall behind them.  DUKE has turned to stone...

DUKE is staring -- RAPT -- TERRIFIED.  BLOOD FLOWS FREELY

onto the floor.  DUKE keeps his voice low.

DUKE looks up -- GONZO has disappeared.

DUKE looks around him -- the entire room has TRANSFORMED

into a ROOM FILLED WITH REPTILES IN CLOTHES, DRINKING AND

GNAWING AT ONE ANOTHER.

GONZO IS SUDDENLY BACK -- AT DUKE'S SHOULDER.

GONZO removes his sunshades and we see he's been crying...

as he speaks he seems to be floating.  Duke struggles to

keep him in his line of vision.

A GROUP OF REPTILES AT A TABLE ACROSS THE ROOM stares at

them, BLOOD DRIPPING FROM THEIR FANGS.

Cut to wider shot -- DUKE is holding on to a man standing

next to him at the bar.  The room has returned to normality.

GONZO is sitting in his original position.

Black screen.

INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - DUSK

A TELEVISION shows the NIGHTLY NEWS.  A BUDDHIST MONK,

protesting the war, sets himself on fire.  A very nervous

BELL BOY is laying out GONZO's order.  A marlin spike is on

the floor next to DUKE.

DUKE is curled by the window -- MESMERIZED by an unseen neon

sign outside the window.  His eyes fill with a million

colored lights.

GONZO sees the BELL BOY out the door -- turns and lays into

DUKE.

DUKE stares -- hears the drone of B52 BOMBERS...

On TV: The LAOS INVASION -- A SERIES OF HORRIFYING

DISASTERS -- EXPLOSIONS AND TWISTED WRECKAGE.

Newsreel footage of MAI LAI MASSACRE and the LIEUTENANT

CALLEY court-martial.

A knock at the door.  DUKE and GONZO break out in a sweat.

GONZO STICKS HIS GUN IN HIS WAISTBAND -- opens the door to

LACERDA -- BOUNCING WITH PUPPY DOG ENTHUSIASM.  GONZO stares

at a man he instantly hates -- watches him with deep

suspicion.

DUKE watches the B-52S DROP THEIR BOMB LOADS.

Looking down to the thick, patterned carpet, DUKE sees the

BOMBS EXPLODE like vicious flowers.

DUKE looks up: LACERDA is a war photographer -- bruised,

filthy and blood spattered.  LACERDA approaches him --

talking a foreign language.

DUKE screws up his eyes -- WILLS NORMALITY BACK.  LACERDA is

now just a keen photographer.L

And with a cheerful wave, he's gone.  DUKE is in shock.

DUKE's attention returns to the devastation on the TV...

GONZO kills the TV.

Black screen.

EXT. DESERT - DAWN

Against A BIG ORANGE SUN, on a concrete slab, MEN FIRE

SHOTGUNS into the dawn sky.  Clay pigeons shatter.  The Mint

Gun Club.

Next to them, MOTORCYCLES REV -- preparing for the MINT 400

RACE: A hundred BIKERS, MECHANICS and assorted MOTORSPORT

TYPES milling around in the pit area; taping headlights,

topping off oil in the forks, last minute bolt tightening.

DUKE wanders through.

A sign by a long trestle table: "KOFFEE & DONUTS." DUKE

walks past -- ignoring the SMILING LADY behind the stall.

INT. RACE BAR TENT - DAY

A real pit of iniquity.  Slot Machines.  Crap tables.  Smoke.

Drunken shouting.  The absolute cream of the NATIONAL

SPORTING PRESS.

DUKE is at the bar, engaged in drunken conversation with a

LIFE REPORTER...showing him his notebook.

A SHOUT goes up from outside.  The sound of engines revving.

In a sudden rush the PRESS CROWD make for the door taking

DUKE with them.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

MOTORCYCLES REV -- tension builds...

A flag goes down.  The CROWD cheers.  The MOTORCYCLES ROAR

AWAY.  A great cloud of dust goes up -- obscuring the RACERS

as they disappear into the desert...

A moment...

The CROWD turns and streams back into the tent.

INT. RACE BAR TENT - DAY

DUKE heads for the bar along with the REST.  It's packed.

Drinks are ordered.

A shout from outside the tent goes up:

The CROWD rushes for the door.  DUKE gets swept along.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

MOTORCYCLES REV.  A flag goes down.  The CROWD cheers.  The

MOTORCYCLES ROAR AWAY.  Another great cloud of dust goes up...

The CROWD head back for the bar.

INT. RACE BAR TENT - DAY

The CROWD surge back to the bar.

This time DUKE fights his way free of the CROWD.

DUKE hits the bar.

A middle-aged HOODLUM in a T-shirt booms up to the bar.

Outside, another batch of motorcycles roar away -- kicking

up more clouds of dust.

A silence.  A MAGAZINE REPORTER lunges across the bar --

grabs the BARTENDER.

Outside, motorcycles roar away.  The dust cloud billows into

the tent -- getting denser.

A FROG-EYED WOMAN claws at the MAGAZINE REPORTER, tries to

haul him up.

A feverishly eager LACERDA appears out of the dust cloud, 3

cameras slung round his neck.

LACERDA grins.

LACERDA downs his drink -- hurries out through the crowd and

out into the cloud of dust.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

Nothing.  Except for a THICK CLOUD OF DUST.

Barely visible, a motorcycle comes speeding into the pits.

The RIDER staggers off his bike.  The PIT CREW gas it up and

sends it back with a FRESH RIDER.

DUKE watches him disappear back into the dust cloud.

A HORN HONKS.  A shiny BLACK BRONCO with DRIVER.  LACERDA

hangs out of the window.

DUKE gets into the Bronco and they head into the DUST CLOUD.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

IN THE BRONCO.

DUKE hangs on with his beer.  Nothing all around but the

HUGE IMPENETRABLE CLOUD OF DUST.  LACERDA snaps madly away

at nothing at all!

The SOUND OF MOTORCYCLES RACING...

We hear music and voices singing:

A moment later, the Bronco races out of the dust.  DUKE

coughs, chokes, drinks beer.

The sound of gun shots...

A DUNE BUGGY races toward them, loaded down with THREE

RETIRED PETTY OFFICERS, DRUNK AS HELL.  The radio blares:

"THE BATTLE HYMN OF LIEUTENANT CALLEY."

The dune buggy is COVERED WITH OMINOUS SYMBOLS: SCREAMING

EAGLES CARRYING AMERICAN FLAGS IN THEIR CLAWS.  A slant-eyed

Snake being chopped to bits by a buzz-saw made of stars and

stripes.  A MACHINE GUN MOUNT on the passenger side.  They

yell over the roaring engines.

DUKE gives DUNE BUGGY PASSENGER #2 A NICE BIG GRIN.  In

response, the PASSENGER #2 narrows his eyes -- tightens his

grip on an automatic weapon.

The DRIVER and DUNE BUGGY PASSENGER #2 exchange looks.

And they ROAR away.

DUKE gets out of the Bronco.

After a moment's hesitation, LACERDA and the BRONCO driver

roar away leaving DUKE alone in the cloud of dust.

EXT. LAS VEGAS STREETS - NIGHT

MUSIC PUMPS OUT.  CRUISING IN THE RED SHARK IN VEGAS.  THE

SKY SWIRLS WITH MILLIONS OF NEON LIGHTS CHASING EACH OTHER

IN BAROQUE PATTERNS ACROSS GIGANTIC HOTEL SIGNS.  PSYCHEDELIC

LIGHT SHOWS TO LURE AND DERANGE THE INNOCENT.  CITY OF LOST

SOULS.

DUKE, beer in hand, drives -- a big smile for the world.

GONZO scans The Vegas Visitor.

The Shark hits a bump.

They hit another bump.

CUT to wide shot.  They are DRIVING AROUND IN CIRCLES in a

large casino parking lot, bumping over the dividers.

EXT. DESERT ROOM HOTEL - NIGHT

TWO BIG SCREAMING FACES.

Reveal the RED SHARK parked on the sidewalk in front of the

Desert Inn.  TWO DOORMEN loom over the car hood.  The

MARQUEE says: TONIGHT.  DEBBIE REYNOLDS.

GONZO leaps from the car, waving a five-dollar bill at the

DOORMAN.

A pause, then... the DOORMAN pockets the bill, hands them a

parking stub.  DUKE and GONZO hurry into the hotel.

INT. DESERT FROM HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT

DUKE and GONZO walk through the lobby.  Black, mirrored,

sleek, classy.

DUKE shrugs and hands over the $5.

A WINE-COLORED TUXEDO stops them at the entrance to the

ballroom.

GONZO and the WINE-COLORED TUXEDO get into an ugly arm-

waving negotiation.

As DUKE and GONZO disappear through the door we can hear the

orchestra blasting out a HIGHLY BLANDIZED "SGT. PEPPER'S

LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND."

A beat.

The door flies open and BOUNCERS manhandle DUKE and GONZO

out.  Despite the rough treatment they're both SCREECHING

WITH LAUGHTER.

EXT. LAS VEGAS STREETS - NIGHT

DUKE DRIVES FAST into the night.  They're both LAUGHING

HYSTERICALLY.

THEN... GONZO finds a TINY TEAR IN HIS JACKET...

GONZO is instantly MOROSE.

GONZO twists round in the car -- SCREAMS back into the night.

EXT. BAZOOKO CIRCUS - NIGHT

A hundred foot high neon clown: BAZOOKO CIRCUS.

The RED SHARK pulls up beneath the sign.

EXT. BAZOOKO CIRCUS CASINO - NIGHT

Into the GLARING, CHASING LIGHTS of the entrance canopy

steps DUKE in EC/U holding a KLEENEX SOAKED IN ETHER TO HIS

NOSE.

DUKE and GONZO approach the entrance with elaborate care-

taking one step at a time -- trying to keep ahead of the drug.

THE ETHER KICKS IN:

DUKE and GONZO BOUNCE off the walls, CRASH into OLD LADIES,

GIGGLE HELPLESSLY as they try to pay -- HANDS FLAPPING

CRAZILY, unable to get money out of their pockets.

The ATTENDANTS indulgently escort them through the TURNSTILES.

INT. BAZOOKO CIRCUS CASINO - NIGHT

Flames shoot up from below the casino.  Above, a HIGH WIRE

ACT with FOUR MUZZLED WOLVERINES, SIX NYMPHET SISTERS FROM

SAN DIEGO, TWO SILVER PAINTED POLACK BROTHERS, and THREE

KOREAN KITTENS.

The WOLVERINE chases a NYMPHET through the air.  TWO POLACKS

swing at it from opposite sides and they are instantly

locked in a death battle.

All plummet to the nets suspended over the GAMBLING TABLES

and SLOT MACHINES.  No one looks up.  The GAMBLERS REMAIN

INTENT ON THE SPINNING ROULETTE WHEEL, THE TURN OF THE CARD,

THE ROLL OF A DICE.

Something causes DUKE to look down.  A dwarf carrying drinks

on a tray is tugging DUKE's pants leg trying to get him to

move out of the way.

GONZO and DUKE go upstairs walking past funhouse booths.

One of them is manned by an orangutan in costume.  A

FAIRGROUND BARKER grabs DUKE.

On a TV monitor a 200 FOOT HIGH DRUNKARD looms over the Las

Vegas skyline screaming OBSCENITIES.

INT. BAZOOKO CIRCUS REVOLVING MERRY-GO-ROUND BAR - NIGHT

DUKE and GONZO sit on the revolving platform.  GONZO

stares -- glassy eyed -- coming apart.

GONZO trembles with fear -- walks to the edge of the

turntable.

DUKE carefully steps off the turntable.

GONZO, eyes staring blindly ahead, squiting in fear and

confusion, rooted to the spot, is carried away.

DUKE reaches out to grab GONZO, who jumps back -- keeps

going around.

The BARTENDER narrows his eyes at them.

DUKE steps onto the merry-go-round -- hurries round the

bar -- approaching GONZO from the blind side and shoves

GONZO from behind.  GONZO goes down with a hellish scream.

DUKE approaches him with his hands in the air.  Smiling.

GONZO refuses to move and stands tense, fists clenched,

looking for somebody to hit...an old woman perhaps?

DUKE walks fast towards the stairs.  GONZO catches up with

him.

EXT. BAZOOKO CIRCUS CASINO - NIGHT

DUKE and GONZO stumble out of the entrance.

INT. MINT HOTEL CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THEIR SUITE - NIGHT

DUKE AND GONZO RUN MADLY DOWN THE CORRIDOR... DUKE TAKING

CARE NOT TO STEP ON THE PATTERNED PART OF THE CARPET.

GONZO STRUGGLES with the key in the lock.

The door SUDDENLY SWINGS OPEN.  DUKE AND GONZO fall inside.

INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

DUKE locks the door.  The suite is crowded with ROOM SERVICE

GOODIES.  DUKE turns to see GONZO staring at two hotel room

keys.  EVERYTHING STOPS.

DUKE snatches a key.

GONZO smiles a slow smile...

GONZO snatches the key back.

GONZO utters an anguished cry -- slaps the wall with both

hands.

GONZO SLASHES A GRAPEFRUIT with a HUGE RAZOR SHARP HUNTING

KNIFE.  DUKE blanches.

GONZO SLICES THE GRAPEFRUIT -- MANIACAL.

GONZO SLICES THE GRAPEFRUIT -- INTO EIGHTHS!

GONZO SLICES -- SIXTEENTHS!

SLICE!  SLICE!  SLICE!

SLICE!  SLICE!  SLICE!  GONZO SLASHES INSANELY!

DUKE watches -- straight-faced.

INT. ELEVATOR - DAY (FLASHBACK)

An elevator door opens to reveal the SMILING FACES OF

LACERDA, THE BLONDE TV REPORTER AND HER CREW.

DUKE and GONZO stagger in.

LACERDA drops his smile.  He's standing beside the BLONDE TV

REPORTER.  A trembling GONZO moonily turns his eyes onto her.

GONZO is TREMBLING BADLY.  There's a moment of uncomfortable

silence.

GONZO shows his teeth to LACERDA.  DUKE laughs trying to

defuse the scene.

GONZO stills -- becomes dangerous -- zeros in on the TV

CAMERAMAN -- groin to groin...

DEAD SILENCE.

Ding!  The elevator door opens, but nobody moves.  The door

closes.

Next floor.  Ding!  The door opens again.  A middle-aged

couple start to get in.  Change their minds.  The door closes.

INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

DUKE and GONZO run down the corridor.  GONZO LAUGHS WILDLY.

INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - DAY

DUKE and GONZO CRASH into their hotel suite -- BOLT THE DOOR.

GONZO stops laughing.

END FLASHBACK.

INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

SLICE!  SLICE!  SLICE!  GONZO with the BIG HUNTING KNIFE --

sliced grapefruit segments everywhere.

GONZO pauses -- A MAD THOUGHT -- turns to DUKE.

INT. CASINO/LOBBY MINT HOTEL

The MAGAZINE REPORTER is on the telephone.

DUKE walks past the REPORTER -- into THE CASINO, THE SAD,

MEAGRE CROWDS AROUND THE CRAP TABLES.  No joy.  DUKE watches.

DUKE stops at the Money Wheel, puts down a two dollar bill

on a number, the wheel turns, he loses.

INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

DUKE walks back into the room.  We hear the LOUD STRAINS OF

THREE DOG NIGHT'S "JOY TO THE WORLD."

He walks to the bathroom and opens the door.

INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE BATHROOM - NIGHT

Submerged in green water, GONZO WALLOWS in the steaming tub.

Soap labels and grapefruit rinds float on the surface.  A

large empty pack of Neutrogena soap lies on the floor.  The

shower is on -- the tub overflowing.  THE TAPE RECORDER

PLAYS, from where it's plugged into the razor socket over

the sink.

DUKE turns off the shower -- notices a HUGE HUNK OF CHEWED

UP WHITE BLOTTER.

No answer.

He switches on the tape. "WHITE RABBIT" begins to build.

DUKE moves the radio as far from the tub as he can and

leaves, closing the door behind him.

INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

DUKE goes across to the sofa and crashes -- exhausted.

Suddenly a great ripping and crashing noise in the bathroom.

DUKE JUMPS up -- crosses to the bathroom door, muttering.

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

DUKE RUSHES IN.  GONZO flails -- trying to reach the radio

with the shower curtain pole which he has ripped from its

mounts.

DUKE GRABS THE RADIO.

DUKE stares down at GONZO.

HIS ARM LASHES OUT OF THE WATER, HOLDING THE KNIFE.

DUKE considers this.  He's had enough.

GONZO falls back into the water, smiling gratefully.

He switches "WHITE RABBIT" back on.  GONZO HOWLS AND MOANS

AND THRASHES TO THE MUSIC, straining to get over the top.

Meanwhile, DUKE picks up a grapefruit from the sink -- a

good two-pounder, he gets a grip on it... and when "WHITE

RABBIT" peaks... HE HURLS IT INTO THE TUB LIKE A CANNONBALL.

GONZO SCREAMS CRAZILY, THRASHING AND CHURNING -- CAUSING A

TIDAL WAVE.

DUKE JERKS THE RADIO CABLE OUT OF THE SOCKET -- SLAMS OUT OF

THE BATHROOM.

INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

DUKE slumps onto the sofa.

SILENCE.

GONZO RIPS OPEN THE BATHROOM DOOR, his eyes unfocused.  HE

WAVES THE RAZOR SHARP BLADE out in front of him -- LUNGES at

DUKE.  DUKE WHIPS OUT A CAN OF MACE.

GONZO stops -- hisses.

GONZO shrugs and reaches for a cigarette on top of the TV set.

GONZO turns toward the bathroom -- suddenly sad.

GONZO shuffles back into the bathroom.  DUKE wedges a chair

up against the bathroom doorknob and puts the mace can next

to the clock.

DUKE turns on the TV.  WHITE NOISE FILLS THE ROOM.  He

collapses onto the sofa and lights up his lightbulb as pipe.

The WHITE NOISE snow storm on the TV is reflected in his

face.  The camera pulls back revealing THE ENTIRE WALL

BEHIND HIM TO BE SWIRLING WITH THE FIZZING SNOWSTORM PATTERN.

The pattern on the wall changes to A 60'S VISCOUS OIL

LIGHTSHOW PATTERN.  With DUKE still sitting in the

foreground, the projected image widens to reveal the interior

of A HAIGHT ASHBURY DANCE HALL full of DANCING PROTO-HIPPIES.

INT. MATRIX CLUB - NIGHT

A slightly YOUNGER DUKE moves through the throng.  All the

action is in a DREAMLIKE SLOW-MOTION.

A ROAD-PERSON with a big pack on his back is shouting.  The

sound of his voice, like his movements, is in slow-motion.

The camera pushes right into the ROAD-PERSON's mouth.

INT. MATRIX MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

Still in slow motion, the YOUNGER DUKE is trying to eat a

HUGE SPANSULE OF ACID.  With difficulty.

DUKE stares at his sleeve, uncertain what to do.  C/U of the

door to the men's room as a MUSICIAN enters speaking in

slow-motion.

The MUSICIAN approaches and looks down at DUKE'S arm.  A

long pause.

Cut back to tight shot of door as it opens and a very clean-

cut, PREPPY, STOCKBROKER TYPE enters.  He freezes in horror.

We cut to his POV.  DUKE is standing in the middle of the

men's room with the MUSICIAN hunkered down at his side...

sucking on his sleeve.  A very gross tableau.  The

STOCKBROKER slowly eases out of the room.

INT. A BAR - YEARS LATER - NIGHT

The STOCKBROKER LOOKING CONSIDERABLY OLDER sits looking

lost, confused, a nervous wreck.  The image flares out in a

TV white noise snowstorm.

INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

DUKE sits staring at the TV.

DUKE throws open the curtains.  Light streams in.

EXT. 1965 STOCK FOOTAGE

We are in SAN FRANCISCO.  IMAGES OF THE TIME FLOOD IN.

DUKE'S FACE IS SUFFUSED WITH A SADNESS AND SERENITY WE HAVE

NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

The memories dissolve into the night skyline of Vegas.

Suddenly towering over the casinos is a 200 foot high Nazi

shouting "WOODSTOCK UBER ALLES!"

INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

DUKE closes the curtain.  The room is in darkness again.

INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - DAWN

A harsh door buzzer.  DUKE jerks awake.  Alone.  Looking

like shit.  Around him is the wreckage of their stay.

DUKE opens the door to a BELL BOY with a trolley load of

fruit, drinks and flowers... and a smile.

The BELL BOY wheels the trolley across the room -- already

stacked with EVEN MORE BOXES OF GOODIES.

DUKE slams the door -- starts FRANTICALLY PACKING.

DUKE sees the DISCARDED WRAPPINGS OF EXPENSIVE, HAND TOOLED

LUGGAGE.  A sudden thought.  He rushes to GONZO's room --

empty.  His plastic briefcase remains on the bed...

DUKE opens the briefcase -- finds the .357 MAGNUM inside.

EXT. LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DAY

GONZO WAVES GOODBYE as he boards an airplane with a set of

brand-new fine cowhide luggage.

INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE HOTEL SUITE - DAY

DUKE emerges with his bag and Gonzo's plastic briefcase --

leaves the DO NOT DISTURB sign on the door -- checks both

ways, then hurries away down the corridor.

INT. MINT HOTEL ELEVATOR - DAY

An anxiety ridden DUKE watches the floor numbers as the

elevator descends.  He searches his pockets...

DUKE finds a last crumpled $5 bill.

The door opens.  A SECURITY GUARD enters with an OLD LADY IN

HANDCUFFS.

DUKE hides the bill -- crams back into the corner.  Doors

close.

INT. MINT HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

DUKE hurries out of the elevator -- eyes on a hovering

MANAGER.  Past the curious look of the reception CLERK.

EXT. MINT HOTEL - DAY

Motoring, DUKE gives his $5 bill to the HOTEL FRONT DOORMAN

with a smile.  The DOORMAN blows a frantic whistle and waves

at the CAR BOY.

The CAR BOY pulls up with a screech.  DUKE jumps in.  The

back seat is stacked with bars of Neutrogena, piles of Mint

400 t-shirts, boxes of grapefruit.

DUKE shifts into drive.  Deliverance!

DUKE freezes.

Resigned, DUKE turns off the ignition.  A young CLERK

arrives breathlessly with a smile and a YELLOW LETTER IN HIS

HAND.

DUKE stuffs the telegram into his top pocket.

The CLERK peers into the car -- sees part of the enormous

stash inside.

He fires up the engine -- eases the RED SHARK into low gear.

SECURITY GUARDS are looking across -- sharing a quiet word

or two.

DUKE's eyes are on the SECURITY GUARDS -- moving closer.

DUKE edges the car forward, but is stopped by the CLERK.

He waves the CLERK off the car -- roars away.

EXT. ROAD OUT OF VEGAS - DAY

DUKE drives the RED SHARK out of Vegas.

A "YOU ARE LEAVING LAS VEGAS" sign flashes past.

Bob Dylan plays: "Memphis Blues Again -- "Aaww, Mama, can

this really by the end...?"

A sign: LOS ANGELES -- 400 miles.

DUKE drives fast.

A sign flashes "YOU CAN RUN BUT YOU CAN'T HIDE."

A patrol car pulls out behind him, lights flashing.

The patrol car screams after the RED SHARK.

DUKE floors the gas pedal.

THE SPEEDOMETER CLIMBS STEADILY.

DUKE signals right.  The RED SHARK screams at 120 mph.

AN EXIT OFF RAMP: MAX SPEED 25.

DUKE hits the brakes.  The COP brakes.

The patrol car spins and fishtails crazily out of control.

EXT. SCENIC PICNIC AREA - DAY

The patrol car comes skidding around the corner.  DUKE

stands beside the RED SHARK, completely relaxed and smiling.

The HIGHWAY PATROLMAN gets out of the car, screaming.

DUKE smiles.

DUKE reaches for it.  And BOTH MEN look down at a beer

can -- which DUKE had, somehow, forgotten was in his hand.

The COP relaxes -- actually smiles... He reaches out for

DUKE's wallet, then holds out his other hand for the beer.

The HIGHWAY PATROLMAN takes it, pours out the beer --

glances in the back seat of the RED SHARK.  Amongst the bars

of soap... A case of warm beer.  DUKE smiles back at him.

He looks at DUKE thoughtfully.

The HIGHWAY PATROLMAN smiles.

The PATROLMAN holds the door for DUKE who gets in.

The PATROLMAN slams the door shut.

EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY

DUKE drives away -- teeth gritted.

DUKE drives past the rest area to an intersection where he

signals to turn right into Baker.  As he approaches the turn

he sees the HITCHHIKER!  As DUKE slows to make the turn

their eyes meet.  DUKE is about to wave -- but the HITCHHIKER

drops his thumb.

DUKE, spooked, SPINS THE RED SHARK round -- ROARS BACK THE

WAY HE CAME.

EXT. BAKER TRUCK STOP - DAY

DUKE on the public phone booth -- screaming.

INT. GONZO'S OFFICE - DAY

DUKE, breathing heavily, hangs up phone.

EXT. DESERT - DAY

C/U of .357 Magnum cylinder being spun.

C/U An IGUANA basks in the sun.

C/U Barrel of the gun.  It fires.  An explosion of desert

dirt.

The IGUANA sits unfazed.

DUKE stands alone in the vast desert firing at nothing, the

thuds of the explosions echo away.

EXT. ROAD INTO VEGAS - DAY

The RED SHARK driving back towards Las Vegas.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

DUKE, now driving a white Cadillac Coupe de Ville -- THE

WHITE WHALE.

DUKE pushes buttons -- lowers the top.

EXT. FLAMINGO HOTEL - AFTERNOON

A GIANT SIGN: THE FLAMINGO WELCOMES THE NATIONAL DA'S

CONFERENCE ON NARCOTICS & DANGEROUS DRUGS.

The WHITE WHALE turns into a VIP parking slot, immediately

attended by impressed MINIONS.

INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL LOBBY - AFTERNOON

DUKE enters -- old Levis, grubby sneakers, 10 peso Acapulco

shirt coming apart at the seams, 3 day growth, eyes hidden

behind mirror shades.  He heads for the check-in line.

THE PLACE IS FULL OF COPS.  200 of them, on vacation, all

dressed in cut price Vegas casuals: plaid Bermuda shorts,

Arnie Palmer golf shirts, and rubberized beach sandals.

Ahead of DUKE -- A POLICE CHIEF argues with the DESK CLERK.

The POLICE CHIEF'S AGNEW STYLE WIFE stands to the side,

weeping.  The POLICE CHIEF'S FRIENDS stand uneasily around.

FRIENDS restrain the POLICE CHIEF.

The POLICE CHIEF's screamed insults fade away...

DUKE steps to the desk, around the raging POLICE CHIEF.

DUKE snaps a credit card down onto the counter.  EVERYONE

goes silent.  The POLICE CHIEF GROUP stares at him like he

was some kid of water rat crawling up to the desk.  The

CLERK hits the bell for the BELLBOY.

ALL EYES turn to the gleaming WHITE WHALE.

DUKE gives the POLICE CHIEF a polite smile -- crosses to the

elevator -- turns to face the GAWPING COPS -- pops a can of

beer and toasts them.  The doors close.

INT. HOTEL FLAMINGO - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SUITE - DAY

DUKE rams the key home -- swings the door open.

INT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - AFTERNOON

DUKE enters.  The door hits something with a thud.

A 16-year-old GIRL with the aura of an angry Pit Bull.

GONZO stands in the bathroom doorway -- stark naked with a

drug-addled grin on his face.

LUCY eyes DUKE venomously.

LUCY keeps her eyes on DUKE.  GONZO idles over and puts his

arm round her shoulder.

DUKE flops onto the sofa.

DUKE notices for the first time that the room is full of

artwork.  Maybe 40 or 50 portraits, some in oil, some in

charcoal, all more or less the same size and same face.

DUKE's voice rises above GONZO.

DUKE fixes GONZO hard.

INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SUITE - DAY

DUKE collars GONZO -- serious.

GONZO stares uneasily at DUKE.

GONZO's face twitches badly.

GONZO starts crying.

Pause.

A silence.

INT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - SUNSET

DUKE is speaking into the phone in hushed tones.

In the background GONZO helps LUCY and her paintings out the

door.

EXT. ON THE STREETS - A CAB STAND - DUSK

The WHITE WHALE pulls up -- DUKE at the wheel.  GONZO helps

LUCY and her paintings from the car.

GONZO unrolls a couple of bills -- pays off a CAB DRIVER --

waves to LUCY in the back with her paintings.  She's starting

to come down...

GONZO gets back in the WHITE WHALE and slaps his hands

together as if washing his hands of the situation.

They pull out into traffic.

EXT. LAS VEGAS STREETS - DUSK

The electric WHITE WHALE heads off down the Strip.  The

sun's going down behind the scrub hills, a good Kristofferson

tune croaks on the radio in the warm dusk.

INT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - BATHROOM - NEXT MORNING

GONZO throws up in the toilet bowl.

In the background, DUKE opens curtains.  Daylight blinds him.

GONZO looks up at his sick reflection -- wipes his mouth

with a towel.

INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - DAY

The EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR -- well groomed, GOP businessman

type -- speaks from the podium.  A banner behind him reads:

NATIONAL DA'S CONVENTION 1971. "If You Don't Know, Come To

Learn... If You Know, Come To Teach."

A BIG MIXED CROWD: TOP LEVEL STRAIGHT COPS, UNDERCOVER NARCS

AND OTHER TWILIGHT TYPES -- beards, mustaches and super-Mod

dress.  Just because you're a cop, doesn't mean you can't be

WITH IT!  However, for every URBAN-HIPSTER there are around

20 REDNECKS.

A dozen big, low-fidelity speakers mounted on steel poles

distort and feed back the EXECUTIVE's voice through the room.

At the back, under a loudspeaker, sits DUKE -- $40 FBI

wingtips, a Pat Boone madras sportcoat, and an official name

tag: RAOUL DUKE, PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR, L.A.

GONZO sits beside him.  His name tag: DR. GONZO.  EXPERT,

CRIMINAL DRUG ANALYSIS.  He's nervous -- close to the edge.

DR. BLUMQUIST -- a "drug expert" -- takes the stage.

The sound systems echoes.

DUKE and GONZO listen in disbelief.

Roars of laughter.

He stands, knocking the ashtray off his chair arm, and

plunges down the aisle to the door.

He stumbles from the room.  DUKE turns his attention back to

the stage.

The lights go down.  A black & white film -- REEFER

MADNESS! -- illustrates his now evangelical talk.

DUKE turns his attention to a 340 pound TEXAN POLICE CHIEF

who necks with his 290 pound WIFE beside him.

DUKE gazes at the TEXAN and his WIFE. -- Feigning sickness,

he gets up, hand over mouth.

DUKE heads for the exit.

DUKE CRASHES OUT THROUGH THE DOOR.

INT. CASINO BAR - DAY

DUKE sees GONZO at the bar -- talking to a SPORTY LOOKING

COP about 40 whose name tag identifies him as a DISTRICT

ATTORNEY FROM GEORGIA.

DUKE joins them.

The BARTENDER cleans his glasses, one ear straining for the

conversation.

The BARTENDER keeps cleaning the same glass -- more and more

furiously.

Agog with the horrors of the story, the BARTENDER polishes

the glass -- faster and faster...

The glass smashes in the BARTENDER's hand.

DUKE turns to a WAITRESS with a warm smile.

The WAITRESS stares -- sickened -- at GONZO.

DUKE gives the DA a brotherly slap on the back.

DUKE and GONZO leave the stunned DA -- staring into the

swirling ice in drink.

INT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - DAY

DUKE and GONZO fall into the suite in fits of laughter.

GONZO feels the nausea rise suddenly -- heads for the

bathroom.  Immediate sounds of retching.

The phone message light is blinking.  DUKE opens a beer,

picks up the phone.

DUKE slams the phone down.  GONZO emerges from the

bathroom -- looking like death.

GONZO sags visibly -- like an animal taking a bullet.

The telephone rings.  DUKE answers.

INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL - RECEPTION - DAY

A worried CLERK speaks in to the phone.

INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE - DAY

In the background GONZO is upturning a sofa to retrieve his

stash from the lining.

He hangs up.  GONZO zaps TV channels -- commercials.

A look of stunned realization from DUKE...

INT. FANTASY COURT ROOM - DAY

LUCY is on the witness stand.

A doomed DUKE and GONZO await their fate.

The JUDGE bangs his gavel.

INT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - DAY

DUKE is madly stuffing his suitcase.

DUKE KEEPS PACKING.  GONZO is looking worried.

DUKE goes in the bathroom.  He finds a little bottle -- a

label: "DRINK ME."

DUKE stares wonderingly at the bottle.

DUKE dips a match head into the brown bottle -- studies

it -- TASTES IT -- NOTHING -- TASTES SOME MORE...

GONZO sits back in his chair... watching MISSION IMPOSSIBLE.

DUKE stares at the back of GONZO's neck.  SOMETHING VERY

STRANGE IS HAPPENING TO HIM...

DUKE CLUTCHES THE BROWN BOTTLE.

GONZO turns to smile at DUKE.

DUKE sees that GONZO is TOYING WITH HIS HUNTING KNIFE...

GONZO JABS WITH THE RAZOR BRIGHT KNIFE.  DUKE'S BODY IS

GOING RIGID -- HE SPEAKS THROUGH GRITTED TEETH.

GONZO GROWS HORNS -- HIS FACE BECOMES A MEXICAN DEMON MASK.

A CLOVEN HOOF BURSTS THROUGH GONZO'S SHOE.

GONZO'S CHEST EXPANDS -- BONY RIBS BURSTING HIS SHIRT.

A TAIL LASHES, HOOFS STRIKE THE FLOOR.  GONZO TOWERS -- A

FLAME RED DEMON!

DUKE is now so wire that his hands are CLAWING UNCONTROLLABLY

at the bedspread, JERKING IT RIGHT OUT FROM UNDER HIM.  His

heels are dug into the mattress with both KNEES LOCKED,

EYEBALLS SWELLING.

GONZO-DEMON LOOMS AGAINST THE CEILING.

GONZO'S VOICE FADES AWAY -- DUKE'S frenzied gaze reveals

GONZO REVERTED TO NORMAL HUMAN SHAPE AND SIZE.

GONZO, a small smile on his lips, backs away warily...

towards the TV -- NOW A HUNDRED FEET AWAY IN THE DISTANCE...

VEINS stand out on DUKE's forehead.  He is purplish-red.

OVER THE TOP!  Too late, he realizes he is NEAR DEATH!

GONZO shakes his head disgustedly.

GONZO sits back down... watching the TV.

DUKE FALLS TO THE GROUND, WRITHING, CATATONIC, SINKING INTO

PARALYSIS.

AND THE SOUND, SUDDENLY AND STRANGELY, OF THE VOICE OF

RICHARD NIXON AND HIS DISTORTED FACE ON THE TV SCREEN.

DUKE PASSES OUT.

BLACK SCREEN

INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

Darkness.  Insanely, somewhere NILSSON plays -- "Put the

lime in the coconut and mix em all up..."

DUKE opens his eyes and the hotel suite rushes in.  He lies,

awkwardly twisted -- unable to move.  He could have been

there days -- months.

DUKE moves his eyes -- taking in his surroundings: Like THE

SIGHT OF SOME DISASTROUS ZOOLOGICAL EXPERIMENT involving

whisky and gorillas.  Blue and red Christmas tree lights

replace lightbulbs, used towels hanging everywhere,

pornographic pictures ripped out of a magazine are plastered

on a shattered mirror.

DUKE manages to move -- stiffly gets to his bare feet --

HOBBLES ROUND THE TRASHED ROOM like a newly risen ape.

DUKE peers into Gonzo's room -- HIS BED LIKE A BURNED OUT

RAT'S NEST -- blackened springs and wires.

QUICK FLASHBACK:

GONZO SMASHES THE TEN FOOT MIRROR WITH A HAMMER:

BACK IN THE ROOM:

DUKE stares at the smashed mirror.

In the bathroom, DUKE'S unlaced boots CRUSH BROKEN GLASS IN

VOMIT AND GRAPEFRUIT RINDS.

DUKE unzips and pisses.  THERE IN THE TOILET BOWL IS THE

MAGNUM .357!

DUKE stares at the golden stream SPLASHING ON THE GUN.

The SOUNDS OF VOMITING come from a closet near the front door.

DUKE looks into the room.  He sees GONZO's ass sticking out

of the closet.  He opens his mouth to speak when, IN THE

SMASHED MIRROR HE SEES THE FRAGMENTED REFLECTION OF HIMSELF...

sleeping on the sofa.

The ominous SOUND OF A KEY TURNING in the room lock.

A hellish scream wakes up the SLEEPING DUKE.  He sees GONZO

grappling naked with the maid -- gun to her head.  GONZO is

muffling her screams with an ice bag.

DUKE shakes his head.

GONZO laughs.

GONZO hustles the MAID to the door.

She repeats the password several times while they listen to

make sure she has it right.

She smiles, repeating to herself "One Hand Washes The Other"

as GONZO hangs the DO NOT DISTURB sign and shuts the door.

CUT BACK TO THE PRESENT.

A grimy tape runs through a grunged-up portable tape recorder.

DUKE sits in the middle of the wrecked suite with his

mangled tape recorder in front of him.

DUKE fast forwards through the tape -- SEARCHING: "Awwww,

mama... can this really...be the end...?"

EXT. SAFEWAY SUPERMARKET - DAY

The WHITE WHALE waits -- gleaming -- beautiful.

DUKE and GONZO burst out of the supermarket riding a shopping

basket loaded with COCONUTS, GRAPEFRUIT and TEQUILA.  They

send DEFEATED SHOPPERS sprawling.

The trolley collides into the WHITE WHALE.  SHOPPERS gather

at the supermarket entrance to watch -- baskets loaded with

junk, SCREAMING KIDS and EMPTY WALLETS.

DUKE switches on the music: JUMPING JACK FLASH.  He selects

a coconut -- ceremonially balances it on the hood.  GONZO

pulls out a silver claw-hammer.  A sly look at the gathering

CROWD... then he smashes the hammer down on the coconut!

A GASP from the surly SHOPPERS.

DUKE places another coconut.  SMASH!  Milk and white meat

flies everywhere.

SMASH!  Coconut fragments fly.

SMASH!

SMASH!

SMASH!

GONZO confronts the CROWD, hammer in one hand, a coconut in

the other.

Silence -- the CROWD uncomprehending of this STONE DEGENERATE.

GONZO brings the hammer down on the hood.  CLANG!

A gasp from the CROWD.  Getting ugly.

The CROWD move in.

GONZO SWINGS THE HAMMER.  CLANG!

DUKE jumps in behind the wheel.

A final CLANG!  GONZO jumps in.

DUKE floors the accelerator -- screams at the CROWD.

They swerve round and through the CROWD.

INT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - NIGHT

DUKE FAST-FORWARDS... PLAYS THE TAPE...

INT. BAZOOKO CIRCUS REVOLVING MERRY-GO-ROUND BAR - NIGHT

DUKE and GONZO (wearing a single black glove) talk

conspiratorially to a 3RD MAN.  A PLACID ORANGUTAN in a bow

tie sits next to him.  THE BAR IS REVOLVING FASTER THAN

NORMAL.  DUKE IS INSANELY TALKATIVE -- WIRED!

INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

DUKE playing the tape.

DUKE fast-forwards again -- searching... TRAFFIC NOISES.

SCREECH OF BRAKES.

A TERRIBLE GRINDING NOISE.

EXT. CAR RENTAL AGENCY - NIGHT

The CAR RENTAL AGENT wrestles with the trashed car.

INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

A HUGE SPLASH...

The tape's gone too far.

DUKE races the tape BACKWARDS... Then, SIRENS HOWL.

INT. BAZOOKO CIRCUS BAR - NIGHT

DUKE is standing in the middle of A SEMI-DESTROYED BAZOOKO

CIRCUS REVOLVING BAR.  Mirrors are broken.  People are

recovering from some kind of battle.  THE BAR SPINS MADLY.

DUKE IS INSANELY WIRED.

INT. WHITE WHALE ON THE STREETS OF LAS VEGAS - NIGHT

GONZO SCREAMS ABUSE out of the window at a Ford alongside

the VOMIT STREAKED WHITE WHALE.  DUKE MAKES A SUPERHUMAN

EFFORT TO STAY ON THE ROAD.

In the Ford: TWO COUPLES -- MIDDLE-AGED AMERICAN FACES

FROZEN IN SHOCK -- stare straight ahead.  GONZO leans out --

close to them.

No reaction.

The lights change.  The Ford bolts.  DUKE keeps pace with

them.

The MAN IN THE BACK SEAT suddenly loses control -- enraged,

lunges against the glass, trying to get at GONZO.

INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

BACK IN THE SUITE:

The tapes runs:

An ugly squeal of brakes.

DUKE fast forwards the tape.  The TAPE MANGLES -- the sounds

ski to a halt...

DUKE grabs the nearest tool -- uses it to hook out the tape,

then realizes... IT'S GONZO'S RAZOR-SHARP FOLDING KNIFE... A

CHILLING MOMENT...

DUKE turns the knife over... THERE'S A DRIED CRIMSON SPOT ON

THE BLADE... OR IS IT DRIED MASHED POTATOES?

READ ON TO FIND OUT!

DUKE SCRAPS A LITTLE OF THE CRUST -- TASTES IT...

HE HEARS THE SOUNDS OF SOMEONE BEHIND BEATEN UP...

EXT. NORTH STAR COFFEE LOUNGE - NIGHT

WHACK!  SHADOWY FIGURES beat up a MAN -- give him A GOOD

KICKING.  BRUTAL AND UGLY.

PAN to reveal a seedy diner -- THE NORTH STAR CAFE in the

background.  Through the window -- DUKE and GONZO sit at the

counter.

INT. NORTH STAR COFFEE LOUNGE - NIGHT

GONZO stuffs a hamburger down PAYING NO ATTENTION TO THE

BEATING going on outside the window.  Duke reads a newspaper.

The WAITRESS brings the ice water.

GONZO gulps down his glass of water and hands her a napkin.

GONZO shrugs.

The WAITRESS stands at the end of the counter with her back

to them while she ponders the napkin... She turns.

THE WAITRESS slams the napkin down on the counter.

GONZO GOES VERY VERY STILL AT THIS...

DUKE picks up the napkin.  On it is printed in careful red

letters: "BACK DOOR BEAUTY?"

GONZO's hand goes inside his shirt.  He PULLS OUT THE RAZOR-

SHARP HUNTING KNIFE.

GONZO KEEPS HIS EYES ON THE WAITRESS.  He walks about six

feet down the aisle and lifts the receiver of the pay phone.

He SLICES IT OFF, then brings the receiver back to his stool

and sits down.

The WAITRESS MOANS.  GONZO places a $5 BILL on the counter.

GONZO walks round the counter TAKING THE PIE OUT OF THE

DISPLAY CASE.

DUKE IS ROOTED TO THE SPOT.

GONZO urges him out the door.  The camera retreats with them.

The WAITRESS STANDS THERE -- PETRIFIED.  Alone in a lousy

bar at night.

INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

DUKE's face as he stares at the knife -- remembering...

EXT. ROAD ON OUTSKIRTS OF LAS VEGAS - DAY

The WHITE WHALE, looking like shit -- it's TOP HALF UP,

TORN, SLAPPING IN THE WIND -- ROARS THROUGH AN INTERSECTION

as the light turns red.

DR. GONZO FRANTICALLY PAWS OVER A MAP.

DUKE drives -- SILENT AND FURIOUS -- sick to his stomach

with the PSYCHOTIC GONZO.

DUKE suddenly SLAMS ON THE BRAKES.

There, crossing the road in front of them, is LUCY -- her

paintings under her arm -- looking lost.  SHE LOOKS UP WITH

A VAGUE SENSE OF RECOGNITION...

DUKE throws the car into a SKIDDING REVERSE TURN AND ROARS

OFF.

EXT. DESERT ROAD OUTSIDE LAS VEGAS - DAY

THE WHITE WHALE TEARS DOWN THE DESERTED FREEWAY.  GONZO

looks wildly around.

GONZO sees that THEY'RE RUNNING PARALLEL WITH THE AIRPORT

RUNWAY.

DUKE HITS THE BRAKES and wrenches the wheel -- takes the

WHALE down into the grassy freeway divider.  WHEELS CHURNING,

HE MAKES IT UP THE OPPOSITE BANK, nose of the car straight

up, then BOUNCES ONTO THE FREEWAY and keeps going right OVER

A FENCE, dragging it through a cactus field and onto the

RUNWAY.

GONZO is FROZEN WITH FEAR -- GRIPPING THE DASHBOARD.  He

throws a worried look at DUKE.

They SPEED UNDER A PARKED AIRPLANE, SHOUTING ABOVE THE JET

ENGINE SCREAM.

EXT. AT THE AIRPLANE - DAY

DUKE SCREECHES UP in front of the DESERT AIR 727.  GONZO

JUMPS OUT -- HEADS FOR THE PLANE.

DUKE watches him go -- RELENTS.

GONZO stops -- turns.

GONZO pauses.

GONZO turns and RACES TOWARDS THE STEPS JUST AS HE IS ABOUT

TO ENTER THE PLANE HE PAUSES AND LOOKS BACK...SMILES...AND

LEANS FORWARD AND VOMITS.

DUKE watches for a second then ROARS AWAY.  PULL BACK WITH

THE WHITE SHARK -- LEAVING THE AIRPLANE FAR BEHIND.

INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE/APOCALYPSE - NIGHT

On the TV an airplane soars thru the sky.  Pull back to find

DUKE barricaded in GONZO'S BEDROOM.  He is typing on his

typewriter.

DUKE records like A WAR CORRESPONDENT.  The CAMERA slowly

rises -- DUKE alone in the room with the TV SPEWING OUT

IMAGES OF WARS AND CIVIL UNREST OF THE 90'S.

RISING HIGHER -- THE WALLS OF THE ROOM APPEAR TO BY 20 TO 30

FEET HIGH.  DUKE SEEMS TO BE AT THE BOTTOM OF A WELL... THE

CAMERA RISES UP THROUGH BROKEN TIMBERS...

HIGHER STILL -- DUKE ALONE IN THE ROOM -- AN ISOLATED BOX

SURROUNDED BY THE TWISTED METAL AND RUBBLE AND SMASHED NEON

SIGNS OF THE DEAD CITY -- A BLASTED LANDSCAPE WITHOUT

LIGHT -- SHARDS OF A CIVILIZATION.

EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY

A BURNING FLARED-OUT SUN.  The camera pans down to DUKE

DRIVING THE WRECKED WHALE.  A piece of the fence flies out

of the back seat as he takes a bump.

DUKE sees THE HARDWARE BARN, A RUSTIC OLD FARM BUILDING

facing the road with a single gas pump outside and a neon

sign that flashes beer.

DUKE PULLS OFF THE ROAD and parks.  Gets out and walks in.

INT. HARDWARE BARN - BAKER, CALIFORNIA - DAY

DUKE enters the DARK, CLUTTERED INTERIOR.  Scattered all

about the store are BITS OF AMERICANA... OLD BARRELS, WAGON

WHEELS, WOODEN YOKES.  A STUFFED HORSE HANGS FROM THE

RAFTERS.  The sunlight shafts through high windows.  AN OLD

MAN is repairing an iron pot-bellied stove near the wooden

bar.  A NORMAN ROCKWELL PAINTING... ONLY REAL.

DUKE can't quite believe this place -- too good to be true.

THE PROPRIETOR serves the ale up ice cold.  DUKE SMILES AND

RELAXES.

As he drinks, DUKE toys with a rack of key chains -- LITTLE

AMERICAN ICONS... A REMINGTON COWBOY, A BUGS BUNNY, A TWEETY

PIE, BETTY BOOP, A BASEBALL PLAYER.  The logo on the rack

reads: AMERICAN DREAM KEY RINGS.

A LOVELY GIRL appears.  Seeing DUKE, she smiles.  CAN THIS

REALLY BE HIS LUCKY DAY?  She approaches him... and...

KISSES THE PROPRIETOR.

A MOMENT.  THE PROPRIETOR'S SMILE DISAPPEARS.

Wordlessly the PROPRIETOR and his GRANDDAUGHTER go to the

back of the store -- GET ON WITH THEIR WORK -- IGNORING DUKE.

WHO FEELS ASHAMED.

DUKE puts some money down on the bar and SLOWLY LEAVES.

EXT. HARDWARE BARN - DAY

A CHASTENED DUKE approaches the vomit streaked WHITE WHALE.

Gets in -- sits there -- deflated -- miserable...

A state bus draws up across from the Hardware Barn.

Somberly, DUKE watches as TWO YOUNG MARINES with duffel bags

step off -- chatting like TRUE BROTHERS...

DUKE switches on the ignition.  Something rolls off the

trembling dash... DUKE catches it...

ONE SINGLE BEAUTIFUL AMYL CAPSULE...

DUKE CRACKS THE AMYL -- INHALES.  THE RUSH MAKES HIM GASP --

TEETH BARED LIKE A MADMAN.

DUKE GUNS THE ENGINE with a laugh -- leans out -- YELLS AT

THE MARINES.

DUKE ROARS AWAY.  AN AMERICAN FLAG FLIES UP FROM THE DEBRIS

IN THE BACK SEAT, MADLY UNFURLING ITSELF AS IT SNAGS ON THE

CONVERTIBLE-TOP FRAME OF THE TRASHED WHITE WHALE!

AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!

The TWO MARINES look after him CONFUSED.

EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY

DUKE drives fast -- TEETH GRITTED IN FROZEN ECSTASY!!

DUKE CRANKS UP THE TAPE RECORDER.

The WHITE WHALE WIPES THE SCREEN BLACK.

AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!
