FADE IN:

EXT.  PARK - DAY

Brief shot of duel.

EXT.  GARDEN - DAY

Mrs. James, talking with a suitor; Roderick, at a

distance.

EXT.  STREET - DAY

Mother and son walking together.

EXT.  CHURCH - DAY

Mother and son entering church.

EXT.  FIELD - DAY

A picnic.  The Dugan family.  Roderick.

EXT.  DUGAN MANOR HOUSE - DAY

A sprawling run-down Irish manor house with large garden,

stables, barn and farm.

Idealized images of Dorothy.

Dorothy talking with the exciseman.

Dorothy talking to the steward.

Dorothy sitting under a tree with the curate, reading a

book.

Dorothy talking to the apothecary's lad.

Roderick, fighting with apothecary's lad.

EXT.  FIELD - DAY

Dorothy, like a greyhound released from days of

confinement, and given the freedom of the fields at last,

runs at top-speed, left and right, back and forth,

returning every moment to Roderick.

She runs and runs until she is out of breath, and then

laughs at the astonishment which keeps Roderick motionless

and staring at her.

After catching her breath, and wiping her forehead, she

challenges Roderick to a race.

They line up together and start on a count of three.

Dorothy uses all her strength, but Roderick holds back,

and Dorothy touches the gate five or six paces ahead of

him.

Dorothy catches her breath, thinking of the penalty.  Then

she goes behind the trees and, a few second later, comes

out and says:

They sit down on the grass.  Roderick searches her

pockets, the fold of her short bodice and her skirt, then

her shoes; then he turns up her skirt, slowly and

circumspectly, as high as her garters, which she wears

upon the knee.  He unfastens them and finds nothing; he

draws down her skirt and gropes under her armpits.  The

tickling makes her laugh.

Roderick has to unlace her bodice and touch her pretty

breasts, over which his hand must pass to reach it.

EXT.  FIELD - DAY

Military review.  One hundred English troops, a few

mounted officers, a small military band, fifty local

people.

The Dugan family, Roderick and his mother, Captains Best

and Grogan.

Roderick admires the troops in their splendid uniforms.

INT.  BALLROOM AT FENCIBLES - NIGHT

Dorothy and Roderick entering.

Several cuts depicting the evening.

Dorothy ignores Roderick; dances, chats, laughs, drinks

punch, and finally, strolls outside with Captain Best.

Roderick makes a half-hearted try at dancing with Miss

Clancy.

EXT.  FENCIBLES BALLROOM - DAWN

The guests leaving and saying their goodbyes.

EXT.  ROAD - DAWN

Dorothy and Roderick on horseback together.

To this sympathetic remark, from the pillion, the saddle

made no reply.

To this, the saddle only replies by grinding his teeth,

and giving a lash to Daisy.

The pillion had by this got her arm around the saddle's

waist, and gave it the gentlest squeeze in the world.

Roderick falls silent.

EXT.  SMALL BRIDGE OVER A STREAM - DAWN

They come to an old, high bridge, over a stream,

sufficiently deep and rocky.

She never finished the word for, maddened by the continual

recurrence of that odious monosyllable, Roderick shouts:

And, giving Daisy the spur, springs with Dorothy over the

parapet, into the deeper water below.

The horse's head sinks under, the girl screams as she

sinks, and screams as she rises.

Roderick lands her, half-fainting, on the shore.

INT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

Various cuts showing illness and convalescence.

Roderick feverish:  the doctor taking his pulse.

Mother brings a tray of food.

Dorothy visiting him.

EXT.  DUGAN MANOR HOUSE - DAY

The air is fresh and bright, and the birds sing loud

amidst the green trees.  Roderick is elated, and springs

down the road, as brisk as a young fawn.

He encounters an orderly whistling "Roast Beef of Old

England," as he cleans down a cavalry horse.

Roderick see Captain Best and Dorothy pacing the path

together.  Her arm is under his, and he is fondling and

squeezing her little hand which lies closely nestling

against his arm.

Some distance beyond them is Captain Grogan, who is paying

court to Dorothy's sister, Mysie.

Raising her hand to his lips.

Roderick rushes into view, drawing his little sword.

Roderick leaps at Captain Best, and collars him, while

Dorothy makes the air echo with her screams.

Captain Grogan and Mysie hasten up.

Though Roderick is a full growth of six feet, he is small

by the side of the enormous English captain.

Best turns very red at the attack upon him, and slips back

clutching at his sword.

Dorothy, in an agony of terror, flings herself round him,

screaming:

So saying, he stoops down and picks up the bunch of

ribbons, which Roderick had flung at Dorothy's feet, and

handing it to her, says in a sarcastic tone:

Best takes off his hat with much ceremony, and makes a low

bow, and is just walking off, when Michael, Roderick's

cousin, comes up, whose ear has likewise been caught by

the scream.

Best exits.

Michael runs after Best.

Dorothy, giving him an indignant look, jumps up and walks

towards the house.

He looks hard at Roderick for a second to two, then he

walks away, humming a tune, looking back at Roderick as he

goes through the old gate out of the garden.

When Grogan is gone, Roderick is quite alone, and he

flings himself down on the bench where Dorothy had made

believe to faint, and had left her handkerchief and the

ribbons and, taking them up, hides his face in them, and

bursts into a passion of tears.

EXT.  DUGAN MANOR HOUSE - DAY

As Roderick passes the courtyard, he sees the Captain's

saddle still hanging up at the stable-door, and his odious

red-coated brute of a servant, swaggering with the

scullion-girls and kitchen people.

INT.  DUGAN MANOR HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY

Roderick enters and takes his place at the bottom of the

big table; the butler speedily brings him a cover.

It is evident that his uncle doesn't know of what

happened, but Michael, who is at dinner too, and Harry,

and almost all the girls, look exceedingly black and the

captain foolish; and Miss Dorothy, who is again by his

side, ready to cry.  Captain Grogan sits smiling, and

Roderick looks on as cold as stone.

His uncle is in high good-humor.

Roderick flings a glass of claret into his face.  The next

moment, he is under the table, tripped up by Harry, who

hits him a violent cuff on the head; as he goes down, he

hardly has time to hear the general screaming and

scurrying that is taking place above him, being so fully

occupied with kicks, and thumps and curses, with which

Harry is belaboring him.

When Roderick gets up from under the table, the ladies are

all gone; but he has the satisfaction of seeing the

captain's nose is bleeding, as his is -- Best is cut

across the bridge, and his beauty spoiled forever.

On which, the captain falls to washing his nose in water,

and answering never a word.

His uncle bursts out laughing, and in this laugh, Captain

Grogan joins.

And here, Harry whispers something in the Captain's ear.

EXT.  ROAD - LATE DAY

Grogan walks with Roderick.

They embrace.

EXT.  HOUSE - LATE DAY

Mother greeting Roderick and Captain Grogan.

His mother looks a little anxious and flushed and, every

now and then, gazes very hard into the Captain's face.

INT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - RODERICK'S BEDROOM - DAY

Roderick waking up.

Roderick at table with paper and ink.

See him write:  "Dearest Mother."

INT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

Roderick eats his breakfast with a good appetite; but in

helping himself to salt, spills it, on which his mother

starts up with a scream.

And then, her heart being too full, she leaves the room.

There is an elegant, silver-mounted sword that hangs on

the mantelpiece under the picture of Roderick's late

father.

A pair of pistols hang on each side of the picture.

Roderick takes down the sword and pistols, which are

bright and well-oiled, and collects flints, balls and

gunpowder.

EXT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - DAY

Captain Grogan and Orderly arrive.

Roderick and Grogan, and the Orderly ride off.

EXT.  COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

They ride their horses at a leisurely pace.

EXT.  FOREST CLEARING - DAY

Harry, Michael and the Captain are already there.  Best,

flaming in red regimentals, a big a monster as ever led a

grenadier company.  The party are laughing together.

They alight from their horses, and join and salute the

other gentlemen.

Harry comes up to shake Roderick by the hand, while

Captain Best takes off his hat, and turns extremely red.

Grogan takes him aside.

Michael, who has not spoken a word, Harry, and the Captain

retire to one side, and Harry gives the signal.

It is slowly given, and Roderick has the leisure to cover

his man well.

Captain Best changes color and trembles as the numbers are

given.

At "three" both pistols go off.  Best gives a most

horrible groan, staggers backwards and falls.

Running towards him, Harry lifts him up -- Michael takes

his head.

Laying open his coat, blood is seen gurgling from under

his gorget.

The unfortunate man does not answer, but when the support

of Harry's arm is withdrawn from his back, groans once

more and falls backwards.

He gives the huge prostrate body a scornful kick with his

foot.

Roderick takes the ribbons she gave him out of his

waistcoat, and the letter, and flings them down on the

body of Captain Best.

They mount up and gallop off.

EXT.  MOTHER'S HOUSE - DAY

Upon seeing Roderick and Harry ride up, his mother, who

has been waiting outside, rushes to her son with wild

screams of joy.  He dismounts, and she kisses and embraces

him.

Still much excitement and hustle and bustle.

INT.  RODERICK'S BEDROOM - DAY

EXT.  HIGH ROAD TO DUBLIN - DAY

Roderick happily riding down the road.

Farm girls in the fields flirting with him.

EXT.  ROAD TO DUBLIN - DAY

A well-armed gentleman dressed in green, and a gold cord,

with a patch on his eye, and riding a powerful mare, puts

his horse alongside.

At this, a pock-marked man coming up, the well-armed

gentleman spurs into his bay mare, and leaves Roderick.

EXT.  ROAD TO DUBLIN - DAY

A footman howls, at the top of his voice.

But the country fellows only laugh at his distress, and

make all sorts of jokes at the adventure which had just

befallen.

Roderick rides up amongst them, and seeing the lady in the

carriage, very pale and frightened, gives a slash of his

whip, and bids the red-shanked ruffians keep off.

Pulling off his hat, and bringing his mare up in a prance

to the chair-window.

He shuffles a few steps away and frowns in the direction

that the Captain has vanished.

EXT.  ROADSIDE INN - DAY

They stop at the inn.

He gives her two gold pieces.

INT.  INN - DAY

periwig, and in a rather tattered nightgown and cap.

Roderick and Mrs. O'Reilly.

There are relics of some mutton-chops and onions on a

cracked dish before them.

Captain O'Reilly searches his pockets for some money to

give to Betty.

She takes out one of the golden guineas Roderick gave to

her.

a single hand.

We see Captain O'Reilly cheat, but Roderick does not.

He pays him the 18 gold guineas, remaining from the sum

his mother gave him.

EXT.  STREET - OUTSIDE O'REILLY HOUSE - DAWN

Roderick exits to the street.  The sound of the gambling

can still be heard in the street.  He is soon joined by

Councillor Mulligan.

Roderick does not reply, and walks slowly away from him

down the street.

INT.  O'REILLY HOUSE - RODERICK'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

Roderick enters.

Valise open, wardrobe lying on the ground, and Roderick's

keys in the possession of O'Reilly and his wife.

He holds up the name, Roderick James, printed on the

linen.

Captain O'Reilly gathers up the linen clothes, silver

toilet articles, and the rest of Roderick's gear.

So saying, Roderick draws his sword like lightning, and

giving a "ha, ha!" and a stamp with his foot, lunges it

within an inch of O'Reilly's heart, who starts back and

turns deadly pale, while his wife, with a scream, flings

herself between them.

O'Reilly exits.  His wife sits down on the bed and begins

to cry.

EXT.  DUBLIN STREET - DAY

Roderick riding down the street, with his valise.

INT.  ALE HOUSE - DAY

Roderick approaches a Captain and a Sergeant, who quickly

make him welcome.

EXT.  BRITISH WARSHIP AT SEA - DAY

Roderick sits very disconsolately over a platter of rancid

bacon and moldy biscuit, which is served to him at mess.

When it comes to his turn to be helped to drink, he is

served, like the rest, with dirty tin noggin, containing

somewhat more than half a pint of rum and water.  The

beaker is so greasy and filthy that he cannot help turning

round to the messman and saying:

At which, all the wretches round him burst into a roar of

laughter, the very loudest among them being Mr. Toole, a

red-haired monster of a man.

Roars the monster, who is sitting, or rather squatting, on

the deck opposite him, and as he speaks, he suddenly

seizes Roderick's beaker of grog and empties it in midst

of another burst of applause.

Roderick and Toole fight with cudgels.  Roderick gives him

a thump across his head which lays him lifeless on the

floor.

Roderick learning the soldierly arts, musket drill, manual

EXT.  BATTLEFIELD - WARBURG - BATTLE FRAGMENTS - DAY

Lieutenant Lakenham is shot, falls, and cries for help.

Roderick and another man take him up in a cloak, and carry

him towards the nearby town of Warburg.

EXT.  A FARMHOUSE - GERMAN STREET - WARBURG - DAY

In order to get into the house, Roderick and the other man

are obliged to fire into the locks with their pieces,

which summons brings the inhabitants of the house to the

door; a very pretty and black-eyed, young woman, and her

old, half-blinded father.

They are at first unwilling to accommodate the guest, but

Mr. Lakenham, speaking to them in German, and taking a

couple of guineas out of a very full purse, speedily

convinces the people that they have only to deal with a

person of honor.

INT.  WARBURG FARMHOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

They carry Lieutenant Lakenham to bed and receive their

five guineas.

In his German jargon, Roderick pays some deserved

compliments to the black-eyed beauty of Warburg, thinking,

with no small envy, how comfortable it would be to be

billeted there.

EXT.  STREET - WARBURG - OUTSIDE THE FARMHOUSE - DAY

He starts back to the regiment, with his comrade, when the

man interrupts his reverie by suggesting they divide the

five guineas.

Roderick gives him one guinea.

The private lifting his musket, hits Roderick a blow with

the butt-end of it, which sends him stunned to the ground,

allowing his comrade to take the other four guineas from

his pocket.

Recovering his senses, Roderick bleeding, with a large

wound in the head, has barely time to stagger back to the

house where he had just left the lieutenant, when he

falls fainting at the door, just as the surgeon exits.

INT.  WARBURG FARMHOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

Roderick is carried by the surgeon and the black-eyed

girl, into another bed in the room where the Lieutenant

has been laid.

INT.  WARBURG FARMHOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT AND DAY

Lischen brings Roderick a refreshing drink; and, as he

takes it, he presses the kind hand that gave it to him;

nor does this token of his gratitude seem unwelcome.

Lischen serving food.

Various cuts, representing different days.

Lakenham behaving as rottenly as Roderick describes:

Roderick making lover to Lischen while Lieutenant Lakenham

sulks in the next bed.

Roderick sitting up in bed.  Lischen has just served him

his supper.

Enter a British officer, an aide who carries a notebook,

and a surgeon.  In a brief scene to be written, we learn

that a sudden movement on the part of the French requires

the British army to follow them.  The town is to be

evacuated, except for some Prussian line-of-communication

troops, whose surgeons are to visit the wounded in the

place; and, when they are well, they are to be drafted to

their regiments.

EXT.  VIEW OUT OF WARBURG FARMHOUSE WINDOW - DAY

Roderick stands by the window, watching English troops and

wagons leaving the town.

INT.  WARBURG FARMHOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

Roderick walks into Lakenham's room attired in his full

regimentals, and with his hat cocked over his left eye.

With this, Roderick puts his hand under his pillow, at

which Lakenham gives a scream that might have called the

whole garrison about his ears.

Roderick threatens him with a knife at his throat.

Roderick, taking his handkerchief, binds it tight round

his mouth, and, pulling forward the sleeves of his shirt,

ties them in a knot together, and so leaves him, removing

the papers and the purse, and wishing him politely a good

day.

EXT.  WARBURG FARMHOUSE - STREET - DAY

Lischen, waiting outside the house, with a saddled horse,

throws her arms around him, and makes the tenderest adieu.

Roderick mounts his newly-purchased animal, waves his hat

gallantly, and, prances away down the street.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

Roderick happily riding along a wooded country road,

rounds a blind bend and sees suddenly before him, about

two hundred yards away, a company of Prussian infantry

resting along the sides of the road, together with a dozen

mounted dragoons.

A quick calculation tells him that is is better to proceed

than to turn back, and he rides into their midst,

approaching a group of officers.

He presents himself as Lieutenant Lakenham and asks for

directions to join his regiment.  He is told that he is

riding in the wrong direction, and is shown a map.

During the explanation, Captain Galgenstein approaches

with an open, smiling countenance, introduces himself, and

says he, too, is bound for the same place, and asks if

Roderick will honor him with his company.

To avoid suspicion, Roderick readily accepts the offer,

and the two men mount up, and ride off together.

EXT.  ROAD - GERMANY - DAY

Roderick and Galgenstein riding together.

Dialogue under voice over.

EXT.  DESOLATE GERMAN ROAD - DAY

Roderick and Captain Galgenstein.  Their horses' heads

together, jogging on.

red-coated Hanoverian sergeant.

He exchanges signs of recognition with Captain

Galgenstein.

EXT.  DESOLATE GERMAN INN - LATE AFTERNOON

Roderick and Captain Galgenstein approach a very lonely-

looking place.

Roderick smiles.

They enter by a great gate into a court, walled round, and

at on end of which is the building, a dingy ruinous place.

A couple of covered wagons are in the courtyard; their

horses are littered under a shed hard by.

Lounging about the place are some men, and a pair of

sergeants in the Prussian uniform, who both touch their

hats to the captain.

The inn has something foreboding about it, and the men

shut the great yard-gates as soon as they enter.

The two sergeant take charge of the horses; the captain

orders one of them to take Roderick's valise to his

bedroom.

Roderick promises the sergeant a glass of schnapps for his

pains.

They enter into supper.

INT.  GERMAN INN - LATE AFTERNOON

A dish of fried eggs and bacon is ordered from a hideous

old wench that comes to serve them, in place of the lovely

creature which had been expected; and the captain,

laughing, says:

Taking off his hat, sword-belt, and gloves, with great

ceremony, Galgenstein sits down to eat.  Roderick puts his

weapons securely on the old chest of drawers where the

captain's is laid.

The hideous old woman brings in a pot of very sour wine,

at which, and at her ugliness, Roderick feels a

considerable ill-humor.

This increases Roderick's ill-humor.

Springing at him like a tiger.

But, agile as he is, Galgenstein is equally on his guard.

He takes two pistols out of his pockets, fires one off,

and says, from the other end of the table where he stands

dodging Roderick, as it were.

The door is flung open, and the two sergeants enter, armed

with musket and bayonet to aid their captain.

The game is up.  Roderick flings down a knife with which

he had armed himself, for the old hag, on bringing in the

wine, had removed his sword.

Enter a private huffing and puffing.

Exit the sergeant, muttering.  Roderick, now alone in the

office, walks closer to the door so that he can hear what

is being said.

Roderick hears the sergeant returning and walks back to

the door.

Then the office door opens, Captain Galgenstein looks out,

sees Roderick, smiles and say:

The Minister nods.

The Captain smiles at Roderick.

The Captain rises and begins to pace back and forth.

Roderick nods.

The Minister studies Roderick, coldly.

INT.  CHEVALIER DE BELLE FAST'S APARTMENT - DAY

Roderick bows, and hands him a letter from that gentleman,

with which the Captain had taken care to provide him.

As the Chevalier reads the letter, Roderick has the

leisure to examine him.

He is a man of sixty years of age, dressed superbly,

wearing rings, diamonds and laces.

One of his eyes is closed with a black patch, and he wears

a little white and red paint, and a pair of moustachios,

which fall over his lip.

The Chevalier is seated at a table near the window to read

the letter.

The Chevalier puts the letter down, looks at Roderick for

a few seconds, and then smiles.

Roderick watches the Chevalier play with a Prussian

officer, Lieutenant Dascher.

Towards the end of the game, Dascher, seeing that he is

losing, makes an unfair stroke, so obvious that the marker

tells him so to his face.

Lieutenant Dascher, for whom the stroke wins the game,

takes the money which is in the stake bag, and puts it in

his pocket, paying no attention to the marker's

adjurations, or to Roderick's.

Roderick, who is without his sword, reaches for a billiard

cue and swings it at Dascher's face.

He wards off the blow with his arm, drawing his sword and

runs at Roderick, who is unarmed.

The marker, a sturdy young man, catches Dascher around the

waist and prevents murder.

EXT.  FIELD - DAY

On the field, there are six people waiting with Dascher,

and his seconds.  Dascher takes 20 louis from his pocket

and hands them to Roderick, saying:

Roderick takes the money and puts it in his purse with the

utmost calm, making no reply to the other's boasting.

He takes his station between two trees, about four paces

apart, and draws a pair of dueling pistols.

No one could have explained his intentions more clearly or

spoken more calmly.

Dascher places himself at the specified distance.

Roderick walks slowly back and forth between the two trees

without looking at him.

Dascher takes aim and fires, missing.

The others think he is mad, and had expected some kind of

discussion between the parties, but not a bit of it.

Dascher takes careful aim and fires a second shot, again

missing Roderick.

Without a word, but in a firm and confident manner,

Roderick fires his first shot into the air.

Dascher looks amazed.  Then, aiming at Dascher with his

second pistol, he hits him in the center of the forehead

and stretches him out dead on the ground.

EXT.  ROAD - DAY

Roderick and Chevalier traveling in their coach.

They meet a four-wheel carriage, drawn by two horses,

carrying a master and a servant.

The driver of the four-wheel carriage wants Roderick's

driver to make way for him.

Roderick's driver protests that if he does, he will upset

his master in the ditch, but the other insists.

Roderick addresses the master, a handsome young man, and

asks him to order his driver to make way for him.

At that, Roderick gets out and holding his drawn-sword

tells the stranger to get out, or to make way for him.

The stranger replies, with a smile, that he has no sword

and that, in any case, he will not fight for such a silly

reason.

He tells Roderick to get back in his chaise, and he makes

way for him.

INT.  GAMING ROOM - NIGHT

Roderick and the Chevalier running a faro bank when an

important lady suffers a huge loss.

EXT.  ROAD - DAWN

Roderick and the Chevalier are sound asleep in their

carriage when they are awakened by a violent jolt, upon

which the carriage overturns in the middle of the road.

The Chevalier is underneath, and screams from the pain in

his right arm, which he thinks is broken.

Their servant forces the door open to help them out,

telling them that the two postilions have fled.

Roderick easily gets out of the carriage through the door,

which is above him, but the Chevalier, unable to move

because of his disabled arm, has to be pulled out.

His piercing shrieks make Roderick laugh, because of the

strange oaths with which he interlards his prayers.

From the carriage, Roderick takes his dueling pistols,

and sword.

Roderick tells his servant to mount and to looking for

armed peasants in the vicinity; money in hand, he leaves.

The Chevalier has lain down on the hard ground, groaning

and in no condition to resist robbers.

Roderick makes his own preparations to sell his fortune

and his life at the highest price.

His carriage is close to the ditch, and he unhitches the

horses, tieing them to the wheels and the pole in a

circle, and stations himself behind them with weapons.

In this predicament, Roderick cannot help laughing at the

poor Chevalier, who is writhing like a dying dolphin on a

seashore, and uttering the most pitiful execrations, when

a mare, whose back was turned to him, take it into her

empty head to empty her bladder on him.  There is nothing

to be done; he has to put up with the whole stinking rain,

and to forgive Roderick's laughter, which he has not the

strength to hold in.

The chill wind and the silence are suddenly broken by an

attack, which is half-hearted and uncertain, by the lady's

lover, and his hesitant band of six cut-throats.

Some falter and run away as soon as Roderick fires his

pistol.

The leader and two heartier followers engage Roderick.

During the fight, they mortally wound the helpless

Chevalier and two of them are killed.

After they flee, Roderick kneels by the Chevalier, who

utters some appropriate last words, then dies.

His servant finally arrives at full gallop, shouting at

the top of his voice, and followed by a band of peasants,

each with his lantern, come to his rescue.  There are ten

or twelve of them, all armed with muskets, and all ready

to obey his orders.
