CHYRON -- ATLANTA 6:12 AM

EXT. SOMEWHAT SEEDY TWO-STORY HOTEL IN ATLANTA -- PRE-DAWN

It's still more night than day as we look down on the HOTEL

ATLANTA. The lit sign for the HOTEL ATLANTA may be the only

source of light as we hear a metallic rattle.

EXT. HOTEL ATLANTA -- SECOND FLOOR -- PRE-DAWN

We follow the metallic rattle to a door. The rattling stops

and we watch the knob slowly turn.

Tight on a feminine arm with a tattoo that announces "hope."

We pull back to find that both arms are employed in the

pulling of what looks like a large suitcase.

NICOLE MAGGEN, a beautiful but tired woman, finishes pulling

the suitcase that we now surmise to be a folded-up massage

table out of the motel room. With her bra in one hand and

the rickety table resting against the wall of the exterior

2nd floor hallway of the motel, she assesses her situation.

She digs in her purse, lights a cigarette and continues

digging in her purse. She finds a beat-up candy tin. She

opens it and quickly sorts through a collection of burnt

foils, heroin foils, looking for residue. Nothing.

She now finds and holds up the 100 bucks she just made. She

flips open her cheap phone and makes a call...she thinks

better of it and hangs up.

EXT. HOTEL ATLANTA -- PARKING LOT -- MOMENTS LATER

NICOLE forces the clumsy table into the hatchback of a 1988

Toyota Tercel and slams it shut.

INT. 1988 TOYOTA TERCEL -- PARKING LOT -- SAME TIME

We hear the electronic ring of her cheap cell phone on

"speaker phone" mode. The phone rests on the passenger seat.

We pull up to find NICOLE slumped with her head resting on

the steering wheel. She is exhausted and irritated...

A MAN answers with music in the background..."Yo.." NICOLE

quickly picks up the phone.

She hangs up the phone and catching herself in the rearview

she tries to smile.

CHYRON -- ORLANDO 7:14 AM

EXT. AMERICAN VALUE SUITES - HOTEL -- ORLANDO -- MORNING

The sun would be rising if the sky wasn't swirling with grey

clouds. We see the American Suites Hotel and recognize it as

a decent commuters' hotel near the airport in Orlando. The

sound of a clock radio breaks the calm of our picture.

INT. AMERICAN VALUE SUITES - HOTEL -- ORLANDO -- MORNING

Through the clock radio we loudly hear two morning drive-time

radio personalities spewing nonsensical patter...

An attractive YOUNG WOMAN wrestles free of the covers and

gets out of bed. She crosses naked through the room as a

cell phone starts ringing.

Back to the bed as WHIP WHITAKER rises into frame and

inhabits the room like a lazy ape at the zoo. WHIP wears his

40 some years of life experience like a medal. Smoke hangs

in the air and empty beers, a pint of vodka and two empty

carafes of cheap hotel wine clutter the table as WHIP

snatches up his phone and answers...

He aggressively drains the last four inches of beer from a

clear bottle and cracks the last fresh one that bobs in the

hotel ice bucket.

The naked, YOUNG WOMAN bends over to pick up her clothes.

We witness her ass as a tanned glass vase with a perfect

crack down the middle. Whip smiles, taking it all in...

The YOUNG WOMAN has re-lit the last half of a joint and is

puffing it to life as WHIP is beckoning with his large hands.

The YOUNG WOMAN, looking more like a stripper by the second,

hands the joint to WHIP who takes a masterful drag. WHIP

shakes his head in violent disapproval to what he hears on

the phone. He exhales in anger as he shouts into the phone.

WHIP hangs up and continues to make quick work of the last

beer as he stares through his thoughts and out the window.

The YOUNG WOMAN we now know as TRINA smiles seductively...

TRINA is still naked but she holds a navy blue skirt and a

white blouse as she hands WHIP his pants. WHIP can't help

but pat that perfect ass as TRINA tries to skip away.

ON THE RADIO We hear the opening bars of a familiar rock

anthem...JOE COCKER's "I'm Feeling Alright"

WHIP leans over the motel table, picks up a soda straw that's

been cut in half. He efficiently sniffs up a line of coke.

INT. AMERICAN VALUE SUITES HOTEL-ORLANDO-HALLWAY-MORNING

WHIP wears his pilot Blues and carries his hat as he strides

confidently down the hallway. JOE COCKER continues to wail,

perfectly narrating the hero's swagger that WHIP maintains

while passing bad light fixtures and ornate wall paper.

EXT. AIRPORT SOUTHJET TARMAC - AIRPLANE - MORNING RAINING

WHIP leans against the landing gear of the JACKSON-RIDGEFIELD

88 PASSENGER JET -- He takes a swig from a small bottle of

mouthwash -- gargles, then spits the green foam on the

tarmac. WHIP wipes fatigue from his face as he stashes the

mouthwash in his pocket, then quickly completes his visual

walk around. He looks at the sky again as he steps on to the

jet way ladder. His foot slips, sending his shoe SPLASHING in

to a puddle.

Whip shakes the rain out of his shoe as he continues up the

stairs.

INT. ORLANDO AIRPORT TERMINAL - JETWAY -- DAY

WHIP enters the jetway from the exterior door at the entrance

of the plane. TRINA is greeting a MAN and his SON.

WHIP waits as TRINA politely parts the stream of folks to

allow WHIP to enter the plane.

INT. AIRPLANE GALLEY -- MOMENTS LATER

WHIP exchanges a look with a MATURE FLIGHT ATTENDANT,

MARGARET THOMASON. She can't help but smile...

TRINA and CAMELIA SATOU, the other flight attendant, laugh.

The girls laugh at the familiar exchange.

INT. AIRPLANE COCKPIT - MORNING

WHIP enters the cockpit, removes his hat and nods to KEN

EVANS, our clean-cut, young first officer.

Whip pulls his emergency oxygen mask off the bulkhead and

takes a huge hit.

EVANS lets him hang...

WHIP studies this little Bible Thumper for a second before...

WHIP focuses on EVANS, trying to read into that statement.

MARGARET returns with the coffee, placing it down near WHIP's

chair on an airline cocktail napkin.

WHIP goes to the head. MARGARET and EVANS exchange a look.

EXT. ATLANTA SUBURB - STONE MANSION - DRIVEWAY - DAY

NICOLE gets out of her Tercel and slams the door twice before

it closes. She checks the address on her phone and looks up

at the enormous mansion.

INT. ATLANTA -- STONE - MANSION - DAY

NICOLE pushes through the overly tall front door of the

house. At first glance, it's completely empty, unfurnished.

A GUY in cargo pants and a baseball hat sleeps sitting up

against the huge dual staircase that leads to the second

floor. Random boxes of video equipment are now evident as

are thick cables that lead to a staircase going down.

On the staircase she immediately encounters another YOUNG

CREW GUY holding a tiny lap dog while standing next to a

NAKED GIRL wearing a Shakespearean Military Helmet. The

YOUNG CREW GUY holds up the "be quiet" finger to his lips.

NICOLE quietly makes her way down a few steps, stopping at

the odd duo. We now hear activity downstairs, music.

SUDDENLY the YOUNG CREW GUY frantically points at the NAKED

GIRL.

And she grabs the TINY DOG and hustles downstairs. NICOLE

waits with the YOUNG CREW GUY until we hear....

NICOLE is free to walk all the way downstairs now.

INT. MANSION - OTHELLO PORN SET - BEDROOM SUITE - DAY

NICOLE enters to reveal a large porn set with a Shakespearean

theme, specifically "Othello." We see an Elizabethan Four-

poster bed with a canopy surrounded by stone arches and

cardboard Venetian Columns. In the bed we find an AFRICAN

AMERICAN PORN ACTOR laying with TWO FEMALE ADULT ACTORS.

A GIRL WITH DYED-BLONDE HAIR stands naked next to the throne

smoking a joint as she shaves her crotch with a man's

electric razor.

NICOLE approaches a YOUNG TATTOOED MAN who only wears board

shorts. He's talking with an OLDER ASIAN MAN as they groom a

pile of coke for snorting.

He sniffs a quick line and gets up to kiss her, she turns her

cheek avoiding the coke-frozen kiss.

KIP is flirting, seeing if she'll consider it...

TIKI does a line and comes up babbling.

A tall thin kid joins them. He wears a Moorish Headdress and

has a bath towel wrapped around his waist.

BRETT drops the towel...

NICOLE walks away. KIP follows her...at the door.

KIP pulls a small tin foil square from his vest pocket.

KIP hands her a tiny baggy of coke. He kisses her cheek.

INT. COCKPIT -- MORNING

Out the window...nothing...the rain pounds. WHIP leans close

to the windshield in an attempt to improve his view.

EVANS reaches down and throws a switch. The windshield

wipers go on. We can now see very clearly the path of lights

the plane is to follow. WHIP looks to EVANS, smiles with

stoned eyes.

EVANS looks out at the rain...

EVANS just stares at WHIP.

16 TRINA straps into her jump-seat. 16

WHIP has razor focus as he places his hand on the throttle.

EVANS sits upright and prepares for battle.

Whip pushes the throttles and the engines SCREAM as they

spool up to full thrust. After a beat, he releases the

brakes.

INT. PASSENGER CABIN - DAY

The passengers are pressed into their seats like blades of

grass as the breeze of the plane's momentum moves them

towards flight. The main lights in the cabin go out and the

small glow of the aisle lights lead us back to the cockpit.

INT. AIRPLANE COCKPIT - DAY

WHIP mans the stick as he squints his eyes and tries to keep

the nose between the lights of the runway.

WHIP laughs and turns to his copilot. EVANS is visibly

nervous as he begins the take-off check...

The JR-88 fishtails as the main gear begins to hydroplane.

Evans is jostled violently.

Whip's eyes are focused on the end of the runway.

The RED THRESHOLD LIGHTS are approaching fast. The plane is

not lifting off.

Whip snaps at him.

C.U. The airspeed indicator reads 145...

Now the air speed indicator climbs to 160...

Whip pulls back on the yoke, and...

The plane jerks up and we can hear the fuselage flex as we

leave the ground. The plane is immediately buffeted by severe

turbulence.

INT. PASSENGER CABIN - DAY

The passengers are rattled like a bag of marbles.

INT. COCKPIT - DAY

The plane is loping up as the rain continues to pound the

windshield. The ascent is very bumpy as the turbulent wind

tosses the plane side to side. Copilot EVANS is

communicating with Air Traffic Control...

EVANS quickly dials the heading and altitude into the auto-

pilot.

Before EVANS can answer, WHIP jumps on the radio.

WHUMP!! The plane hits a severe bump! EVAN's headset turns

sideways and he quickly rights it. WHIP chokes back a

nervous chuckle.

Whump!! Once again the plane is violently rocked.

INT. PASSENGER CABIN - DAY

The passengers audibly HOWL as the roller coaster dip lifts

most of their stomachs into their throats. A few overhead

luggage bins fly open and bags and coats rain down.

The THREE ATTENDANTS calmly collect the luggage and stow it

in the kitchen. They talk loudly for the benefit of the

passengers.

MARGARET grabs the cabin mic and addresses the passengers.

INT. COCKPIT - DAY

The plane rocks and shutters. WHIP seems oblivious as he

continues to serenade Evans.

WHIP is interrupted by Air Traffic Control.

THE PLANE TAKES ANOTHER VIOLENT DIP

EVANS' headset flies off. His tie and all the loose

equipment and coffee cups are thrown to the ground.

WHIP pushes the yoke forward. The plane pitches downward.

WHIP points to the MFD screen.

C.U. MFD screen: A narrow line of blue is visible between the

two monstrous convective cells.

EVANS nervously squints at the screen.

EVANS jumps on the radio.

WHIP banks the plane to the right.

Suddenly -- the plane falls 200 feet in 2 seconds.

A huge air pocket pulls the rug out from under the JR-88.

From the cockpit we can hear the passengers scream. EVANS

holds on to his headset.

WHIP remains cool as he rides more bad air. The plane now

bounces rapidly over a non-stop succession of speed bumps.

INT. PASSENGER CABIN - DAY

The passengers clutch each other as they rattle like bobble

head dolls; it's getting worse.

INT. COCKPIT - DAY

WHIP pushes the throttle and the 17-year-old Jackson-

Ridgefield JR-88 accelerates directly into a huge black

cloud. He begins to dip the nose level to the ground.

WHIP pushes the 17-year-old Jackson-Ridgefield JR-88 directly

into a huge black cloud. He begins to dip the nose towards

the ground.

INT. PASSENGER CABIN - DAY

The passengers howl in fear as the plane pitches forward.

INT. COCKPIT - DAY

EVANS calls out to WHIP...

The AIRSPEED INDICATOR moves from GREEN right up to the

YELLOW line.

WHIP banks the plane steeply to the right. From the cabin we

HEAR the passengers SCREAM!

Now ATC comes on the radio...

EVANS looks at WHIP -- panicked.

The shaking gets incredibly violent. WE HEAR SCREAMS from

the cabin. Evans points to Whip's airspeed indicator.

WHIP starts to hum the Joe Cocker song again as he cranes his

head up close to the windscreen -- looking intently at the

dark sky.

Suddenly, we see a beam of light breaking through the black

clouds -- 12 o'clock high. A God ray.

WHIP banks the plane hard, lifting the nose -- pointing it

directly at the crack in the darkness. He shoves the

throttles to full power.

The plane is banking, rising and accelerating.

INT. PASSENGER CABIN - DAY

The screaming passengers go quiet with the strange new

development. The shaking has eased from a 10 to a 5.

INT. COCKPIT - DAY

Whip keeps the plane climbing steeply. The Vertical Speed

Indicator shows we're ascending 2,000 feet per minute. The

altimeter spins up past 12,000 ft.

The murky grey outside becomes lighter and brighter, until

suddenly, in a dramatic reveal...

WE BREAK THROUGH THE CLOUDS!

Instantly the air becomes perfectly smooth.

Whip levels off and maneuvers between the two towering cloud

walls -- smooth as silk.

Gliding over the fluffy white clouds and through the

shimmering rays of the sun -- it feels like WHIP just flew

the JR-88 into heaven.

A joyous CHEER ERUPTS from the passenger cabin

WHIP pulls the power back and switches on the auto-pilot.

EVANS is cheery, almost giddy...

WHIP, however, is very shaky and beaded with sweat.

EVANS looks at him and nods.

WHIP hangs up, puts on his pilot hat and exits the cockpit.

EXT. NICOLE'S GEORGIAN GARDENS APTS FRONT DOOR-ATLANTA-DAY

NICOLE has her keys out as she hustles for her door. She

looks to find the door slightly open. She pushes it fully

open to see FRAN, the building manager, standing in her

living room holding her camera. He tries to be casual...

She is scared and pissed by his invasion of her space.

She grabs the full-bodied 35 MM camera from him.

He takes a slimy step towards her. She steps away.

FRAN leans against the door frame, trying to strike a

seductive pose. NICOLE smiles and holds up her camera.

FRAN steps outside and on to the landing.

INT. NICOLE'S APARTMENT FRONT DOOR -- ATLANTA -- DAY

NICOLE kicks the door shut and locks it, escaping FRAN who

calls through the door.

NICOLE puts her camera down gently on the table.

She now flings her purse on the ground in frustration...the

contents spill on to the carpet. Amidst the flotsam we focus

on yet another candy tin that springs open. NICOLE fixes her

stare at the hypodermic needle resting inside.

INT. CABIN - GALLEY - DAY

WHIP exits the lavatory drying his hands with a towel. He

looks down the aisle to see TRINA far down the cabin. TRINA

sees WHIP, comes back up the aisle and stands with her back

to him watching the passengers.

WHIP opens a bottle of orange juice and takes a big swig. He

then pours half of it in the sink. WHIP places the open

juice bottle on the liquor cart, reaches up, and grabs the

cabin mic to address the passengers.

WHIP steps into the aisle so the passengers can see him.

WHIP waves with a calm smile that would put anyone at ease.

Titters of laughter from the passengers as WHIP moves the

half step he needs to put himself behind the liquor cart.

We now watch from behind WHIP as his free hand reaches into

the top drawer of the liquor cart and pulls three small vodka

bottles out.

WHIP puts the mic to its hook. Alone in the galley and out

of view, he quickly empties the vodkas into the orange juice

bottle and replaces the cap. Whip shakes the juice as he

tosses the little empties into the galley trash. Whip takes

a healthy pull from the spiked juice, downing nearly half.

WHIP knocks on the cockpit door. MARGARET emerges and WHIP

disappears in to the cockpit.

INT. NICOLE'S APARTMENT -- ATLANTA -- DAY

Framed photos on a bureau show: Christmas around the tree

with Mom (30) and Dad (33) and a girl who's 8 and a boy who's

5. (In the reflection of this photo we see a flame cooking

heroin in a spoon.)

Another photo depicts an 8 year-old girl's birthday party.

(In the reflection of this photo see wee Nicole tying off.)

A last photo shows NICOLE (30)and her mom (54). They are

both wearing kerchiefs. We can see that her mom is gaunt and

has no hair under her kerchief. (In the reflection of this

photo we see the needle injected into her arm.)

A HYPODERMIC NEEDLE is placed in front of that picture. Next

to the photos is a small CD station that NICOLE taps to life

and turns up. The opening bars of Michael Fitzpatrick's

"Medication" begin to play.

We pull wide to see NICOLE pull the bra from her arm that she

used to tie off with. Her face is pure happiness.

Clothes and a peach crate filled with camera equipment join a

suitcase on its side that acts as a coffee table. NICOLE

picks up her camera and admires it before putting it down.

She picks up the cigarette she had staged pre dope fix and

reaches for the lighter. She laughs and hums, pulls out gum,

a brush...She's holding the brush when the first heavy wave

of narcotic death washes over her. She leans back and uses

the wall for support. "Medication" is hitting its chorus...

She puts her arms out at her sides, euphoria. A slow, sloppy

smile breaks across her face. She exhales slowly. She

reaches for the now burning cigarette when the second wave of

heavy drugs hits. NICOLE looks up with fear.

She reaches for the little bag of coke that KIP gave her.

Next she grabs her phone, flipping it open. As she tries to

dial it, she crumbles to her knees. NICOLE somewhat controls

her fall to the ground, but her eyes are fading. The little

bag of coke falls from her fingers.

There's no way to stem the tide of the oncoming overdose.

NICOLE's arms stretch out in a frozen reach as her body sinks

to the floor. On her back like a girl making angels in the

snow as her eyelids flutter, she slips away.

We hear a pounding on the door. FRAN is on the other side...

INT. COCKPIT - DAY

WHIP is now passed out in the seat next to EVANS. He has two

approach plates (charts) folded and tucked between his

sunglasses and eyes, creating a makeshift sleeping mask. His

lower jaw hangs open as his head bobs in deep sleep.

Margaret leans in through the cockpit door talking to Evans.

EVANS maintains a military posture as he monitors the plane's

progress. The flight is smooth and the sky appears clear.

The radio interrupts...

Evans dials 30,000 into the auto-pilot, but just as he rolls

the thumb switch to the "Descend" position...

BANG! THE PLANE SUDDENLY PITCHES SIDEWAYS

Instantly the autopilot's Shut-Off SOUNDS.

WHIP jolts awake and pushes up his sleeping "shades."

Evans grabs his yoke and pulls.

EVANS does, we HEAR a big mechanical SNAP.

Margaret runs to the PA, leaving the cockpit door open.

BANG! THE PLANE PITCHES DOWN VIOLENTLY AND BEGINS A NOSE

DIVE.

The instrument panel LIGHTS UP like a Christmas tree -- A

WARNING HORN BLARES.

WHIP pulls on his headset and keys his mic.

Evans pulls the throttles to idle.

Evans engages the emergency hydraulic pumps.

The plane starts to bank to the right, WHIP puts his hand

against the wing-window to stay in his seat. EVANS grabs his

harness with both hands. The passengers shriek with terror.

MARGARET stumbles into the cockpit.

The plane suddenly pitches up, begins to roll, and dives

again.

MARGARET rushes to the bench in the galley.

Whip grabs his yoke and pulls. The plane inches up.

Whips keeps back pressure on his yoke.

Whip continues to give orders to Evans.

Evans deploys the landing gear and applies the speed brakes.

The wind ROARS as the gear doors drop. The airframe shakes

and rumbles violently.

Evans hesitates.

Evans quickly throws the "EMRG FUEL DUMP" switch.

The airplane bucks and drops violently -- A chorus of

terrified SCREAMS ERUPTS from the main cabin.

Whip pulls on his yoke with all of his strength and the dive

shallows out a bit.

The yoke pressure pulls Whip hard against his harness.

The yoke is ripping away from Whip's hands.

Evans dumps in the flaps. The JR-88 slows dramatically and

balloons up.

Whip is interrupted by the radio.

Evans is confused and panicked, he throws his hands up.

Evans sees it.

Evans does exactly that, then pulls back on his yoke --

nothing!

Once again, the plane pitches into a dive. Whip strains to

hold on.

Evans strains to reach Whip's Reversion Pull-Handle -- but

can't.

Evans moves to release his harness, but Whip stops him.

Margaret tumbles into the cockpit, catching herself on Whip's

chair. She's crying.

Margaret opens the jump-seat and starts to pull on her

harness. Throughout the scene she is struggling with her

harness.

With tears streaming down her cheeks, she gives Whip a brave

nod.

Whip releases back pressure from his yoke, pushing it forward

-- the plane noses downward 20 degrees!

MORE TERRIFIED SHRIEKS come from the back. Margaret quickly

disengages then re-engages the large red handle.

Whip pulls back on his yoke. The plane pitches up.

Evans pushes up the throttles. Whip gingerly applies pressure

to his stick. His face fills with worry.

Then suddenly... WHAP! Whip's yoke flies out of his hands and

SLAMS forward!

The plane banks right and drops! Margaret SCREAMS!

Now, ATC comes on the radio...

The plane continues to drop, increasing its nose-down

attitude and speed.

WHIP pushes both of his feet forward, stretching his body to

get leverage as we can see him pulling on the yoke, trying to

get the plane out of the dive it's in.

Evans is starting to lose it.

Whip takes Margaret's hand and puts it on the throttle

levers.

WHIP's body is fully extended as he pulls back on the yoke

and turns into a steep bank.

The G-force of the roll presses Evans away from the console.

Margaret bends forward and pulls the lever.

Whip quickly retracts the speed brakes, then PUSHES HIS YOKE

FULL FORWARD! The clumsy liner does a slow, ungraceful roll.

INT. PLANE CABIN - SAME

WE WATCH as the PASSENGERS scream as the plane rolls over and

they are suspended upside down.

EXT. SKY OVER ATLANTA - SAME

The JR-88 finishes its barrel-roll, skimming over suburban

rooftops and trees. A CLOUD-TRAIL of Jet-A SPEWING from its

wings.

As the INVERTED PLANE ROARS overhead the CAMERA PANS to find -

Being rushed out of her apartment on a stretcher. The TWO

PARAMEDICS and Fran (the landlord) instinctively duck as the

jet SCREAMS over.

INT. FLIGHT DECK - SAME

THE PLANE IS COMPLETELY INVERTED!!

THRU THE WINDSCREEN -- THE PLANE LEVELS OFF -- IT'S INVERTED

NOSE RISES TO MEET THE HORIZON.

EVANS hangs in his harness straps as dust and smoke swirl

around him. The inverted wings make an EERIE WHISTLING SOUND

as the plane SHUDDERS violently side-to-side.

WHIP reaches over and pulls the throttles back. He suddenly

seems strangely calm, comfortable with his fate...

MAIN CABIN -- WE WATCH OVER TRINA'S SHOULDER AS SHE HANGS

TRINA struggles to stay in her seat as she looks at the

passengers hanging. She watches as a YOUNG BOY loses his

grip and flops to the ground.

TRINA unhooks and flops to the ground. We follow her as she

runs on the ceiling of the cabin towards the BOY. She gets

there and starts lifting him towards his FATHER.

COCKPIT -- SAME TIME

The ATC voice now plays loudly through the entire cockpit.

It takes Whip a second to find the mic key on his inverted

yoke...

There's a very pregnant pause...

EVANS seems calmed by WHIP'S workaday attitude about their

insane tragedy. But suddenly...

WARNING LIGHTS BEGIN FLASHING!

WE HEAR A HORRIBLE, METALLIC GRINDING SOUND as the engines

become oil-deprived.

WHOOP, WHOOP, WHOOP! -- THE ENGINE FIRE ALARM SOUNDS!

Evans pulls the Fire Bottle handle.

Whip BARKS at air traffic control.

WHIP'S POV -- THRU THE INVERTED WINDSCREEN --

A small white church on a hill -- 100 yards past the church

is a soy bean field and a two-lane blacktop.

BACK TO ACTION -- CLOSE ON WHIP -- HE CALMLY FIGHTS ON.

EVANS is breathing heavy as his face is beet red from the

blood rushing to it.

THE NERVE-WRACKING ALARMS CONTINUE TO SOUND!

Evans deploys the right engine Fire Bottle.

WHIP'S POV -- WE'RE HEADED TOWARD THE CHURCH --

A NEW ALARM SCREAMS!

WHIP PULLS HARD ON HIS YOKE -- THE PLANE SLIPS SIDEWAYS AS IT

STARTS TO RIGHT ITSELF. Whip yanks back the throttles!

Evans and Whip deploy every bit of drag they can think of.

We follow WHIP's eye line that takes us off the control panel

and to the windshield.

THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD WE SEE -- the landscape and the church

steeple getting closer and closer.

The plane does a clumsy roll to the right -- AND GETS STUCK

PERFECTLY ON ITS SIDE!

EVANS pushes the power to full thrust AND THE PLANE FINISHES

ITS ROLL!

THE PASSENGERS HOWL!

INT. MAIN CABIN -- GALLEY -- SAME TIME

TRINA is still struggling to strap herself in to her

jumpseat. The plane rolls! She sees Camelia...

P.O.V. -- Camelia is tossed across a row of SCREAMING

passengers.

TRINA loses her grip and is violently thrown against the

galley wall!

Like a rag doll, CAMELIA is hurled down the cabin aisle as

the plane plummets!

Trina slides across the galley floor and CRACKS her head on

the jumpseat.

INT. COCKPIT -- SAME TIME

Whip frantically spins the trim wheel!

THRU THE WINDSCREEN --

THE CHURCH SPIRE IS COMING RIGHT AT US -- BOOM! -- THE RIGHT

WING CLIPS THE STEEPLE, SHEARING OFF THE CROSS!

WE HEAR A HORRIFIC, METALLIC GRINDING -- followed by a

TERRIFYING SILENCE -- RIGHT ENGINE STOPS.

An unnerving quiet descends over the passenger cabin. The

only SOUND is the wind RUSHING past the air-frame.

CLOSE ON WHIP --

THROUGH THE WINDSCREEN --

WE'RE DROPPING RAPIDLY TOWARD THE GROUND -- A GROUP OF PEOPLE

GATHERED NEAR A POND IN THE CHURCHYARD SCATTER -- some are

wearing long white robes.

CLOSE ON WHIP --

CLOSE ON THE YOKE -- WHIP PULLS WITH ALL HIS MIGHT --

CLOSE ON THE TRIM WHEEL -- WHIP SPINS IT "TRIM UP" --

THROUGH THE WINDSCREEN -- THE BEAN FIELD RUSHES UP AT US...

CLOSE ON WHIP --

ALL SOUND FADES AWAY AS THE SCREEN BLEEDS HOT WHITE --

OVEREXPOSED.

IN GRAPHIC SLOW-MOTION -- THE INSTRUMENT PANEL CRUMPLES AND

COLLAPSES AROUND WHIP --

And in a final, ironic, cosmic gesture --

WHIP'S CONTROL YOKE HURDLES TOWARD HIM -- IMPACTING HIM

BETWEEN THE EYES --

NOW WE HEAR -- SHOUTS, SCREAMS -- A WOMAN SOBBING.

WHIP'S POV --

WE SEE Whip's lower torso being pulled from the wreckage --

There is swirling SMOKE AND DUST, SMALL FIRES --

Evans strapped in his chair, bleeding --

Margaret SOBS uncontrollably --

EXT. CRASH SITE -- SLOW MOTION - HILLSIDE -- DAY

WHIP's being pulled up a grassy hillside. In the distance

WHIP can see the shattered airplane lying in a crater. Fires

smoulder around the impact zone. Passengers are joined by

first responders as they frantically carry, drag and walk the

injured and the dead from the plane. WHIP sees a fire truck

fly by him, down the grassy slope towards the burning plane.

WHIP'S POV --

LOOKING UP at the sky -- WE SEE black, oily SMOKE billowing

across the shattered church steeple --

WE GLIMPSE PEOPLE rushing past, some are wearing white

flowing robes --

WE HEAR DISTANT SIRENS APPROACHING AND PEOPLE PRAYING --

A LOUD SIREN SCREAMS --

WHIP'S POV --

LOOKING UP at the ceiling of an ambulance --

TWO EMTS are urgently attending to him --

WHIP'S POV -- NIGHT

A halogen overhead light and an air-conditioning vent --

brown-stained acoustic ceiling tiles --

WE HEAR the rhythmic BEEP of a heart monitor --

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- NIGHT

WHIP's eyes open to see the halogen overhead lights of a

hospital room. He turns his head slightly to see the flicker

of a TV with no sound.

TELEVISION -- NEWS - NO SOUND -- GRAINY CELL PHONE FOOTAGE

A news show runs a loop of eye witness cell phone footage of

the plane turning over and crashing belly down.

A MAN who has been watching the TV turns to see that WHIP is

awake. The MAN turns off the TV, gets up and approaches

WHIP's bedside. WHIP knows him.

CHARLIE ANDERSON is a late 50's former military pilot who

carries that familiar air of Texas comfort and entitlement.

WHIP is moved by the first realization of survival.

CHARLIE moves close to deliver the news.

A NURSE enters the room. CHARLIE nods to her.

CHARLIE ducks out of the room. WHIP is alone and still

getting his bearings. He goes to scratch his head and

catches sight of his left hand. It's swollen and sore --his

wrist is bandaged with a splint-brace. He now looks at both

of his hands in wonder.

WHIP hears a muffled conversation that gets clearer as do the

images of MANY PEOPLE entering the room. A POLICE OFFICER

accompanies a DOCTOR and TWO NTSB AGENTS.

An NTSB AGENT holds a small voice recorder towards WHIP.

WHIP nods as his senses are getting sharper.

WHIP offers a "thumbs up" gesture. The DOCTOR steps in.

WHIP quietly nods. The DOCTOR leaves and WHIP begins to

study his body. His left leg is wrapped, his left wrist has

a splint-brace --

WHIP looks at the NTSB OFFICER and slowly speaks.

WHIP's voice is failing him as his throat is sore and dry.

WHIP tries to exhale as the loss of TRINA sinks in.

WHIP nods as the NTSB OFFICER leaves with the police and

other officials in tow. CHARLIE returns to WHIP's side.

CHARLIE tries to put a reassuring hand on WHIP's shoulder.

WHIP lets that information land as his head is swirling.

WHIP starts to weep as he needs to begin the long process of

expressing this trauma.

WHIP nods as he wipes his eyes on his heavily bandaged hand.

WHIP thinks about his long since fractured family...

CHARLIE has a zip-locked bag with his phone, keys, sunglasses

and wallet. WHIP looks at them, odd to see them encased in

plastic.

CHARLIE hands WHIP his card.

WHIP nods trying to pull it together. CHARLIE pats WHIP's

shoulder before he leaves. WHIP sits up and pulls his phone

from the plastic bag. Dials, waits...

WHIP closes his eyes and exhales. He now stares at the foot

of the bed for a long, long moment. WHIP squeezes his eyes

shut tight -- holding back tears. Then quietly, as if

whispering a prayer...

INT. HOSPITAL -- ELEVATOR DOORS -- MORNING

The Stones "Sympathy for the Devil" kicks up as we wait...

The doors split open and HARLING MAYS steps out. HARLING has

a pony tail and a goatee and is probably wearing a Tommy

Bahama button down shirt.

We follow HARLING as he strides down the hall. With ear buds

in, HARLING points a Sanyo pistol-shaped cam corder at the

ATTENDING NURSE at the nurses' station, recording her...

The Stones continue to wail as Harling strolls on, adjusting

the duffel bag he has slung over his shoulder.

EXT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

HARLING stands in the doorway looking in. He sees...

The MORNING NURSE is helping WHIP to stand. HARLING points

his camcorder at WHIP and the NURSE.

HARLING immediately goes to WHIP and supports him.

HARLING boxes her out. She steps away.

No reaction as the NURSE collects the trash and towels.

HARLING focuses his camcorder on the NURSE and leaves WHIP in

an unsteady stance. HARLING films her and comments...

And she's gone. HARLING turns to WHIP.

HARLING helps WHIP to the window...

EXT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- PARKING LOT -- DAY

From WHIP's window we can see a slew of news vans with signal

towers as well as reporters milling about -- a small zoo.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY

HARLING and WHIP stare for a moment at the circus below.

WHIP doesn't last long and slowly returns to the bed as

HARLING continues to gawk.

HARLING pulls an iPad out of his knapsack and flips it open.

He lets a collection of videos run...

On HARLING's iPad we see footage of PRESS swarming outside

WHIP's condo. We also see the crash scene footage.

WHIP's hands shake as he grabs the bed frame. HARLING takes

notice and stashes the iPad...

HARLING helps him get settled. We see the beads of sweat on

WHIP's lip and forehead.

HARLING immediately picks up the small paper cup that holds

WHIP's pain meds. He fishes out the two pills and stares at

them. HARLING shakes his head.

HARLING casually tosses the pills down his gullet and

expertly swallows them without water. He grabs WHIP's

medical chart and scours it as he prattles on...

HARLING hands WHIP a pack of smokes from his pocket. He also

pulls out a carton of smokes from his backpack.

WHIP motions with his hands to "calm down."

HARLING pulls something from his vest pocket and puts it in

WHIP'S hand. WHIP looks at it and back at HARLING.

HARLING continues to pull items from the bag.

HARLING freezes his frenzied energy with this odd command.

HARLING hears him this time and raises his hand and nods,

putting the VODKA back in his own duffel. HARLING tosses a

tee shirt, sweat pants and flip-flops on the bed, then...

HARLING holds up a silk Japanese Happi Coat, with elaborate

stitching depicting colorful birds flying around Mt. Fuji.

WHIP pulls his keys from the bag that CHARLIE gave him.

HARLING puts his hand on WHIP's forehead in an attempt to

reassure him. A quiet moment before HARLING slips out.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- 11 PM -- SAME EVENING

WHIP wakes up in a cold sweat. He is breathing heavy as he

scans the room. LIGHTENING FLASHES from outside the window.

Thunder RUMBLES.

WHIP looks to the night stand where we see a pack of nicotine

gum has been chewed through. WHIP uses his hands to get to

the edge of the bed. He roots through the duffle bag that

HARLING left and finds a pack of smokes and a Bic lighter

still in its package.

Determined to smoke, WHIP eyes a WHEEL CHAIR that has been

placed next to his bed. Leaning against the wheelchair is a

medical cane.

INT. HOSPITAL -- QUIET HALLWAY -- MOMENTS LATER

Wearing his Happi Coat (or robe), WHIP limps in to the empty

hallway with the use of his cane. He checks the quiet

corridor as he begins his quest...

INT. HOSPITAL -- FIRE DOOR -- 11:38 PM

The door swings open, and no one appears to be on the other

side. Now WHIP fights to push the heavy door open again to

slip through. A hand grabs the door and holds it. WHIP

walks into the sanctity of the stairwell.

INT. HOSPITAL STAIRWELL -- SAME TIME

We find the owner of the helping hand was NICOLE who returns

to a quiet spot along the wall of the stairwell as she

demurely smokes a cigarette.

WHIP leans his cane against the wall and carefully pulls a

pack of smokes from his pocket.

NICOLE smiles and looks down, awkward around men when she is

not loaded. She drops her cigarette which we see was barely

smoked as she maneuvers to leave.

He offers her a cigarette, she takes it.

And they do. They sit in silence as the stairwell fills up

with smoke. After a long beat...

WHIP studies her, she's beautiful in an exhausted way...

Nicole shakes her head.

Again it falls silent as we let them smoke and think in the

sanctity of the fire stairs.

A VOICE breaks their silence.

We hear a metallic rattle and WHIP and NICOLE look to the

stairs.

A GAUNT YOUNG MAN makes his way to their landing. He is

dressed in a hospital gown and carrying an I.V. pole on which

hangs a small bag of clear liquid. The man's hair has

completely left him. His skin is gray. Eyes hollowed from

his battle with cancer.

WHIP offers him a cigarette. He takes it and fires it up

with a lighter he keeps stowed in the pocket of his gown.

WHIP looks at the ground as the GAUNT YOUNG MAN studies him.

Nicole gives Whip a look.

GAUNT YOUNG MAN laughs.

The GOD topic has silenced the stairwell...

GAUNT YOUNG MAN smokes the cig to the nub and rubs the

remains against the smooth concrete wall.

NICOLE looks at him. She nods.

She laughs, what a question.

NICOLE laughs to keep from weeping.

The men watch as NICOLE quietly cries, it's powerful.

GAUNT YOUNG MAN starts laughing. WHIP joins him.

The GAUNT YOUNG MAN leaves, clanging away with his I.V. pole.

NICOLE wipes away her tears, we see her hospital bracelet as

well as her track marks.

It's quiet.

NICOLE steps on her cigarette and puts the nub in her pocket.

She begins to leave. WHIP stops her.

NICOLE laughs.

WHIP laughs.

NICOLE's laugh tapers off as she senses his honesty.

She measures him.

There is strong tension between them. An orderly busts

through the down the stairs. This breaks their stare.

WHIP leaves NICOLE where he found her.

EXT. ST. FRANCIS REGIONAL MEDICAL HOSPITAL-LOADING DOCK-DAY

WHIP is wheeled out of a service exit by an ORDERLY who also

holds the duffle bag of WHIP's stuff around his neck. Whip no

longer wears the eye patch but has a butterfly bandage over

his left eye brow.

HARLING jumps out of his 2001 Cadillac STS and immediately

takes over, grabbing the duffel bag.

The ORDERLY tries to hand WHIP a medical file. HARLING

snatches it.

HARLING hugs WHIP who hangs on tight. The ORDERLY spins the

chair around and heads back inside.

HARLING uses his key fob to remotely pop the trunk and stow

Whip's duffel.

53 As they drive off, we see media mayhem collected in front of 53

58 Veal? Really? Don't you know the 58

INT. WHITAKER FARM -- LIVING ROOM -- DESK AREA - DAY

WHIP empties his pockets onto the desk top. His keys, wallet

and his cell phone are placed next to an old rotary phone

attached to an old answering machine. WHIP plugs in his cell

phone charge, dials in for his messages and puts it in

"speaker mode" as we hear...

WHIP again deletes the message and decides to just shut the

phone down. He continues to empty his pockets. In his jacket

pocket he finds a prescription bottle of pain pills.

WHIP holds it up, opens it and pours a few out in his hand.

INT. WHITAKER FARM -- BATHROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

WHIP pours the pain pills into the toilet. He then opens the

medicine cabinet and starts to empty all of the bottles into

the toilet.

INT. WHITAKER FARM -- KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER

WHIP goes to the collection of liquor bottles next to the

sink that act as a makeshift bar. He picks up a bottle of

vodka. He unscrews the cap and sniffs the contents. He

slowly tips the bottle and pours it into the sink.

Whip opens the refrigerator and removes an assortment of

beers. He pops them open and pours them in the sink. The

faucet running to offset the pungent smell.

INT. BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

Whip opens a dresser drawer and finds a couple of zip-lock

bags of "bud" hidden under the socks.

INT. BATHROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

Whip dumps the weed into the toilet and FLUSHES it.

INT. LIVING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

A cigarette dangles from WHIP's mouth as he ferrets around

the room, showing the focus and determination of a serial

killer cleaning his kill site. He finds rolling papers,

roaches, more liquor and weed -- he reaches into the Shell

Bag that's hanging next to the shotgun rack and finds another

"pint."

INT. KITCHEN -- LATER

Whip opens the freezer to put in his frozen dinner and his

"packet of veal" and finds another fifth of vodka.

He pours the vodka in the sink and tosses the bottle into the

trash -- which is piled high with empties.

Through the kitchen window, Whip sees the farm's old

weathered barn. Whip furrows his brow.

EXT. WHITAKER FARM -- BARN -- DAY

WHIP slides open the heavy barn doors to reveal -- A VINTAGE

CESSNA 172 -- covered in dust and bird shit from the years of

stagnant storage.

WHIP lights a smoke as he marvels at the little piece of

aviation history resting in his barn.

INT. WHITAKER FARM -- BARN -- AIRPLANE -- DAY

Whip walks past the plane and starts to examine the large,

two-story, open-ceilinged barn that is junked full of farm

equipment and old furniture. He finds...

A WALL OF PHOTOS -- WHIP WITH HIS FATHER NEXT TO A PLANE.

HIS GRANDFATHER, FATHER and WHIP pose next to the barn.

A CROP DUSTER acts as the background for a picture with a 15

year old WHIP and his father next to a small plane.

63 Whip dumps out the liquor onto the grass as he hobbles back 63

65 WHIP uses just his cane now as he drags a garbage bag full of

INT. WHITAKER FARM--LIVING ROOM DESK AREA--MOMENTS LATER

WHIP sits at the coffee table eating his frozen dinner while

watching news coverage of the crash.

WHIP is startled by the phone that never rings. He snaps off

the TV using the remote.

WHIP is in no hurry to answer the phone as the old time ring

continues. WHIP goes to the desk where the phone rests and

he watches the old answering machine click on. We hear...

WHIP reaches for the phone but decides to just listen to

CHARLIE...

INT. CARR'S OFFICE -- ATLANTA BASEBALL STADIUM -- NIGHT

CHARLIE sits at a beautiful wooden table in a modern glass-

walled office above a baseball field. The table is populated

with casually-dressed businessmen and lawyers as this after-

hours meeting was called on the fly.

CRASH SCENE PHOTOS and FILES fill the table top. We also see

a photo or two of the WHITAKER FARM.

INT. WHITAKER FARM -- LIVING ROOM -- DESK AREA -- NIGHT

WHIP stands still as a beep sounds, ending the message.

INT. ST. REGIS HOTEL -- EXECUTIVE BUFFET -- MORNING

The executive buffet is a staple at the ST. REGIS. A long

center table with silver trays houses eggs and breakfast

meats. Fruit, bagels and a staff of servers cater to the

business elite of Atlanta.

CHARLIE ANDERSON sits at a corner table with HUGH LANG, a

young, well-dressed African American man. CHARLIE and HUGH

are chatting in jocular spirit when WHIP approaches, walking

much more confidently with his cane.

WHIP studies HUGH as he pulls out his chair.

HUGH stands and shakes hands with WHIP.

WHIP and HUGH remain standing, both feeling a little "alpha."

She smiles and nods. She's off to get the coffee.

WHIP just stares at the two men who have large buffet plates

surrounding them.

WHIP is quiet, anxious to hear the purpose of the meeting.

The WAITRESS returns with the coffee. It's quiet as they

wait for her to finish. She does.

Death demands responsibility. Six

dead on that plane, someone has to

pay.

The plane fell apart at 30 thousand

feet.

The airline will try to prove

equipment failure. Which would

make the manufacturer responsible.

The manufacturer of the plane will

try to prove poor maintenance of

the equipment by the airline.

Or pilot error.

I had to fly that plane inverted,

that means upside down, Hugh. Do

you get the picture? 100

passengers hanging upside down, 500

feet off the ground. Do you have

any idea what that sounds like?

I do. I heard the black box last

night.

Are you a pilot?

No I'm not.

Then you don't know what the fuck

you're talking about.

Hugh's on our team and it's the

NTSB's ball game. They run the

investigation and they will

ultimately rule on the cause.

They interview the entire flight

crew and the passengers. They hold

WHIP studies the two men, trying to read their poker hands.

WHIP looks at CHARLIE and then to HUGH...

The WAITRESS checks in.

An awkward silence as they wait for her to clear out.

They all digest the information as the WAITRESS delivers the

cinnamon rolls. She leaves. It's still quiet.

68 The WAITRESS returns with a coffee pot. WHIP leaves. 68

TELEVISION -- The transcription and AUDIO of the cockpit

recording continues...

The BARTENDER returns with the orange juice.

The BARTENDER nods and turns in acknowledgement of the order.

The BARTENDER returns with a frosted glass and pours two

shots over the ice.

WHIP downs the vodka in a flash.

The OTHER BARTENDER has the remote and starts searching for

more coverage of the crash. He stops at a local report.

ON TELEVISION WE SEE

EXT. CRASH SITE -- DAY

A REPORTER gives a lead in at the crash site.

A YOUNG SHORT HAIRED BLONDE MAN GIVES HIS ACCOUNT

Another reporter has a passenger's account.

A MAN with SHORT DARK HAIR explains his experience.

A third Reporter gets a FEMALE NEIGHBOR's perspective.

EXT. CRASH SITE -- NIGHT

A news light shines on a lone reporter who stands atop a

small hill above the crash field.

71 After a moment, he starts the car, shifts into gear -- downs 71

72 WHIP raises an eyebrow, and drives toward the building. 72

WHIP PICKS UP THE PACE OF HIS LIMP TOWARDS THE FRACAS.

WHIP crests the top of the staircase to see...

SCENE 75 COMBINED WITH SCENE 74

INT. NICOLE'S APARTMENT -- SAME

FRAN, the landlord, wielding a baseball bat as he berates

NICOLE. NICOLE has her full-bodied 35 MM camera hanging from

a strap around her neck. FRAN points the bat at her head.

Whip WHACKS Fran with his cane.

FRAN stumbles and falls as the bat goes flying to the ground

and rolls away. WHIP licks the foaming top of his excited

beer.

Whip jabs him again with his cane.

NICOLE who is crying, now laughs in relief. She can't believe

it. "America's Hero" has just come to her rescue.

WHIP moves to comfort her..

She points to a camera tripod and a box of broken portfolios

with photos dripping out.

FRAN has gotten up and stands a safe distance from WHIP...

Whip flings his beer at Fran's head, then pulls out his

billfold.

Whip throws the money on the floor.

FRAN sorts the options...none...he tentatively bends down and

picks up the cash. Keeping a wary eye on Whip.

Fran smirks. Whip drills Fran with his eyes...

FRAN's smirk fades. He relents and picks up the box as WHIP

grabs the lighter shoulder bag and they head downstairs.

INT. WHIP'S BUICK -- DAY

NICOLE stares out the window as the city disappears.

WHIP pulls a beer from the box and offers it to Nicole.

NICOLE smiles, thinks about it...she shakes her head, "no."

WHIP pops the top and takes a drink.

WHIP looks to her, she to him. They begin to laugh at the

absurdity. When it subsides...

NICOLE nods. A long moment quietly passes.

78 NICOLE continues to soothe his aching leg. After a moment, 78

80 He hears something. He gets up and goes to the window. It's a

82 HUGH nods and recedes from the door as WHIP goes to get 82

EXT. CRASH SITE -- OBSERVATION SCAFFOLDING -- DAY

WHIP joins HUGH on a rectangular platform on top of a two-

story scaffolding frame. The platform provides a perfect

view of flight 227's final resting area. We see the awesome

devastation that 50 tons of metal flying at 140 miles an hour

can do to a hillside.

WHIP looks at HUGH expecting him to finish his thought. HUGH

holds his look for a beat before changing thoughts.

We hear voices; a low murmur that gets louder, chanting.

WHIP looks to the top of the hill to see...

PENTECOSTAL MASS IN PROGRESS

A MINISTER in a dark purple cloak calls from the new

testament as the CONGREGATION responds in unison.

There are at least 50 people sitting in white folding chairs

at the foot of the hill. A small brook babbles behind them.

WHIP continues to take in the bizarre scene.

WHIP is overwhelmed by the magnitude of the crash field and

the WORSHIPPERS. WHIP looks back at the crash site to see...

Inside the crash site, a small group of INVESTIGATORS with

NTSB jackets following the lead of a CONFIDENT WOMAN. HUGH

answers the question in WHIP's mind...

WHIP continues to stare at the awesome dent in the earth.

It's quiet before HUGH makes his case.

WHIP's had enough. He starts to walk away. HUGH stops him.

INT. CARR'S OFFICE - ATLANTA BASEBALL STADIUM -- DAY

A huge office with a glass wall that looks out over the

diamond. We are high above the outfield; if GOD was a

baseball fan, this would be his office. We now meet AVINGTON

CARR, a very righteous and self-satisfied, wealthy, southern

gentlemen.

CARR scans the room, reading faces, holding court.

Ornate, wood furniture helps to announce the political feel

of MR. CARR's world. Presidential photos and commendations

pepper the walls. It's quiet...

Everyone looks to HUGH as it gets oddly silent... We get our

first look at LEN CALDWELL, the president of the pilots'

union. LEN tries to wrest some control and exude some

confidence.

Through a glass wall we see...

WHIP SITS ON A COUCH READING A MAGAZINE IN A RECEPTION AREA.

Everyone steals glances at WHIP as CARR continues to

dominate.

EVERYONE goes quiet as CARR's anger commands silence.

HUGH can't stifle a laugh. They look to him.

CARR looks to his lawyer who nods...

CARR stands to signal the end of the meeting. HUGH stands to

stop him.

It goes quiet as everyone reflects on that reality.

86 CARR nods, sizing WHIP up. WHIP returns the nod as HUGH 86

87A We hear them laugh as WHIP still stares in to space. 87A

INT. WHITAKER FARM -- KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER

WHIP pulls open the door to the fridge and pulls out a gallon

of water in a plastic jug. WHIP stands and takes a long pull

of the cold water.

EXT. WHITAKER FARM -- PORCH -- MORNING

NICOLE sits with her camera staring at a candle on the table

in front of her. An AA Book rests on the table. She snaps a

picture of the flame and then focuses out to the grassy

landing strip and the rolling hills.

WHIP enters carrying the large plastic bottle of water from

the kitchen.

WHIP coughs and rubs his eyes.

It's quiet as they let the awkward exchange pass.

WHIP reaches for the camera. She hands it to him.

NICOLE takes a moment to tamp down some emotions.

WHIP still holds the camera as he sits down.

NICOLE lights a cigarette as the memories are tough.

89A A CHURCH BELL SWINGS INSIDE A STONE BELFRY 89A

MARGARET is sensing WHIP's struggle.

It's quiet. MARGARET smiles and leans in and kisses WHIP on

the cheek.

She starts to leave...WHIP stops her with...

MARGARET appears speechless...

MARGARET fights tears as WHIP has struck a blow.

The tears flow now as MARGARET can't hold them in. WHIP

realizes he's gone too far. Not knowing what to do, WHIP

walks away.

EXT. PEACH STREET DRUGS - AZURE BLUE SKY OF AUTUMN --

PHARMACY -- PARKING LOT - DAY

WHIP watches an airliner fly over head as he stands by his

car smoking a cigarette. He wears his suit from the funeral.

NICOLE approaches. She's in a great mood.

A beat.

She sorts through her shoulder bag...

WHIP nods, playing with the lighter.

She is bubbling with happy spirit; she's hot. She's hard to

deny as WHIP can't help but smile at her.

INT. ST. FRANCIS CATHOLIC CHURCH -- ATLANTA -- NIGHT

A MAN stands at a podium wearing a coat and tie. He is lost

in the energized retell of a story.

The room erupts with laughter. NICOLE is really taken by the

candor of the speaker as she joins the room in laughter.

BARRY makes eye contact with a STERN LOOKING OLD TIMER.

BARRY holds up a loose leaf binder and addresses the man...

WHIP glances around to find himself in a sea of raised-handed

alcoholics. A few look at WHIP with no judgement.

WHIP is very reserved, poker-faced.

93 WHIP is gone. 93

CLOSE UP TELEVISION -- KEN EVANS IS ON TV LIVE FROM HIS

HOSPITAL BED.

WHIP exits as fast as he arrived. He's gone. PIERS MORGAN

continues from the TV...

INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY -- NIGHT

WHIP steps off an elevator and walks down the quiet hospital

hallway toward a room where a few TECHNICIANS are packing up

the last bits of TV equipment.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM -- KEN EVANS' ROOM -- NIGHT

WHIP stands in the doorway and addresses EVANS...

EVANS stares at WHIP with a blank look.

WHIP senses an unwelcome undercurrent. He locks eyes with

EVANS trying to read him. Silence before EVANS speaks to the

ATTENDING NURSE...

The ATTENDING NURSE files out placing a chair next to the bed

as she leaves. WHIP enters. It's again quiet.

EVANS smiles at WHIP.

VICKI nods, holding her cross with the chain across her lips.

WHIP goes white and drops his head.

WHIP gets up.

WHIP sits and studies EVANS.

EVANS begins to mist up with sincere inspiration.

WHIP stares into EVANS' eyes and sees a believer's

conviction. EVANS reaches out his hand to WHIP.

WHIP slowly moves out of his chair and kneels at the side of

EVANS' bed. WHIP takes EVANS' hand and bows his head as he

reaches for VICKI's at the same time. It's quiet before...

97 WHIP looks at EVANS and his WIFE whose heads are bowed with 97

WHIP wipes at his nose.

NICOLE takes in this cool trinket of aviation history.

WHIP laughs, remembering...

NICOLE laughs thinking they're playing a game.

NICOLE realizes he's serious as he opens another beer.

NICOLE walks away, leaving WHIP with his plane and his dream

of freedom. WHIP calls after her.

INT. WHITAKER FARM -- WHIP'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT

We follow WHIP as he enters the house and approaches the

doorway of the bedroom. WHIP sees NICOLE sitting on the bed.

She quickly tucks her cell phone away as WHIP holds up his

hand to signal a truce.

NICOLE looks at the sincere love in his eyes.

This is the most sincere plea she's ever heard.

WHIP wraps his arms around her. We stay on NICOLE's face as

he holds her tighter and tighter.

INT. WHITAKER FARM -- KITCHEN -- EARLY MORNING

NICOLE is dressed and sitting at the kitchen table. Past

NICOLE we can see WHIP lying in bed.

She has all her possessions in a crate and a duffel bag at

her feet. She finishes a handwritten note and places it

down. NICOLE picks up the note and begins to reread it.

She hears a car in the driveway -- she picks up her stuff and

takes one last look at the sleeping WHIP. She leaves,

careful not to make a sound.

EXT. WHITAKER FARM -- FRONT DOOR -- EARLY MORNING

NICOLE quietly exits the house, carrying a crate of her

stuff. She has a duffel bag of clothes over her shoulder as

she makes her way to SHEILA's car that we see parked at the

top of the driveway, far from the house.

INT. WHITAKER RANCH -- BEDROOM -- LATER SAME DAY

WHIP stirs, wakes up and looks around. WHIP walks around

looking for NICOLE. He finds the note and reads it. The

reality of her disappearance sets in and he moves to the

window and stares out at the barn.

WHIP returns his look inside the house and he sees the big

book of AA on the table near where the letter was left. WHIP

picks it up and throws it across the room. He then grabs the

back of a chair and tosses it against the wall.

After wiping photos off of the wall he picks up an empty beer

bottle and fires the bottle at a shelf on the opposite wall.

The bottle explodes and WHIP stops as he realizes he came

within an inch of shattering a framed photo of he and his

son.

We hear the antiquated ring of the OLD HOUSE PHONE. WHIP

relaxes his shoulders as the ringing phone distracts him.

Whip is now drawing heavy breaths as the ringing phone is

answered by the old machine...

The beep concludes...

WHIP snatches the phone of the hook.

104 WHIP listens as CHARLIE talks... 104

This picks directly at the scab of WHIP's guilt.

This stops WHIP cold.

They let that land. WHIP nods.

HUGH explodes in frustration.

HUGH gets big as he has to add the final piece of credence to

the coronation.

HUGH is so loud and emotional even WHIP lends focus.

Everyone waits for the response as HUGH acknowledges the

debris around them...

WHIP pulls out his cigarettes and frees a smoke from the

pack.

CHARLIE steps between them as this exchange spirals.

WHIP starts to walk away.

WHIP turns and walks. HUGH wheels on CHARLIE and lights him

up.

106 WHIP walks away from them -- away from the bright, clean, 106

111 WHIP checks the mirrors before taking a long drink from a 111

DEANA takes a moment before stepping aside to allow WHIP in.

INT. SUBURBAN HOME -- SAME TIME

WHIP glides into the kitchen of this fastidiously kept home.

WHIP turns to see his 16 year old son, WILL, standing at the

foot of the stairs near the door.

DEANA now steps between them and pushes WILL towards the

stairs as she puts her hand on the doorknob.

WHIP turns quietly. He opens the door and walks outside to

find...

A GROWING GALLERY OF NEWS RATS START JOSTLING FOR PICS

WHIP is completely caught off guard. They step right onto

the tiny landing with him.

Through the fracas we hear a variety of questions lobbed at

WHIP.

We hear the squelch of a police siren as a COP CAR lands on

the scene.

A REPORTER trips down the stairs. WHIP grabs one of these

news rats and just before pounding him, he breaks in to a

relaxed smile.

The GALLERY quiets to listen and record his words. WHIP

again is incredibly smooth and intuitive while drunk and

under pressure. We can hear the squawking of POLICE SIRENS

approaching.

WHIP starts to head down the porch and the frenzy erupts

again.

116 WHIP exhales, trying to slow his racing heart and head. He's

We boom down to find WHIP who looks drained as he sits on

CHARLIE's couch in the fastidiously neat office. WHIP holds

an unlit smoke.

The WOODEN POCKET DOORS SLIDE OPEN and CHARLIE's WIFE

gestures towards WHIP. WHIP stands as CHARLIE enters.

AMANDA slides the door shut as CHARLIE throws his bag and his

coat down with gusto. He reaches up and pushes a button on

the TV and it goes off.

118 CHARLIE nods, hoping that WHIP can deliver on that promise 118

INT. ST. JEROME HOTEL -- GUEST HALLWAY -- NIGHT

We watch a can of Coca Cola swing in WHIP's hand. We pull

out to find WHIP walking with CHARLIE down a hallway of THE

ST. JEROME HOTEL. Time has passed as WHIP looks the best

we've ever seen him look. He is well rested, well dressed

and carrying a suit in a wardrobe bag.

As we approach the open door to a guest room, HUGH pops out.

A plain clothes SECURITY GUARD follows HUGH out of the room

and stands behind him.

CHARLIE addresses the SECURITY GUARD.

HUGH stands by the open door and gestures CHARLIE and WHIP

inside...

INT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL -- WHIP'S ROOM -- NIGHT

HUGH walks in to the center of the room and turns to WHIP.

WHIP puts his wardrobe bag down on the bed.

WHIP is checking his phone. HUGH gestures to CHARLIE for him

to leave so they can be alone.

CHARLIE leaves and HUGH joins WHIP at the window. HUGH hands

WHIP a thick folder.

WHIP laughs a little.

The two respectfully nod. HUGH leaves and the door shuts

behind him. WHIP puts the folder on the table and steps to

the mini-bar. He bends down and opens the fridge...

WHIP sees the fridge is overly stocked with soda and juices.

Every soft drink you can imagine. No booze, anywhere. WHIP

chuckles about the alcohol removal as he grabs a coke.

WHIP unbuttons his shirt and pulls it out of his waist line.

INT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL -- WHIP'S ROOM -- LATER

Whip sits on the edge of the bed eating a room service steak.

The File Folder sits on the table.

WHIP'S ROOM -- LATER

Now in his undershirt and shorts, Whip lies propped up on the

bed watching television. The File Folder now rests on the

bed.

WHIP'S BATHROOM -- LATER

Whip is meticulously shaving. He stares a long while at the

disposable razor as the water runs over its blade. After a

moment he goes back to shaving.

WHIP'S ROOM -- MUCH LATER

Whip sits at the small table looking through the file. He

leafs through photos, with no recognizable emotion. He looks

to the clock radio -- 12:37.

WHIP'S ROOM -- BATHROOM -- LATER AGAIN

We hear the shower running and steam fogs the mirrors.

WHIP'S ROOM -- LATER THAN THAT

WHIP wears boxers and a tee shirt with a towel around his

neck. He looks to the clock -- 2:07

WE WATCH HIS SUIT BE PULLED FROM THE WARDROBE BAG.

WHIP lays the suit out neatly on the couch, separating the

shirt which he hangs from a light fixture to relax any

creases.

WHIP'S ROOM -- LATER YET AGAIN

The room is dark. A soft wind RATTLES the window sash.

WHIP lies on the bed. He sighs, sleep is alluding him and

the anxiety of tomorrow's events on no sleep has his head

spinning. He hears a metallic click. He stays quiet to

listen for it...there it is again. An annoying click.

The clock reads "3:43"--

He sits up and switches on the LIGHT. He rubs his eyes and

goes to the table and sees the file folder laying there. As

he is about to pick it up he hears the metallic click again.

He goes to investigate.

HOTEL ROOM CONNECTING DOOR -- SAME TIME

The connecting door is unlocked. WHIP arrives and waits. He

now watches as the connecting lock-bolt CLICKS against the

frame -- the door swinging in a draft. He looks up to see

the culprit -- a heating vent. WHIP flips the vent closed.

Whip now pushes the door with his finger, opening it a few

inches. Nothing. Darkness.

Whip enters.

INT. CONNECTING HOTEL ROOM -- SAME

The room is vacant. The bed is made. The drapes are pulled

open.

WHIP walks quietly on the carpet towards the window. The

night is clear. Quiet. Whip takes in the city lights.

WHIP'S POV --

Among the glass and steel office buildings, Whip spots a

church spire. A simple cross is perched on top.

Whip looks at the church, deep in thought.

Then suddenly...

We HEAR A HUM. THE GENTLE HUM OF AN ELECTRIC MOTOR.

WHIP turns from the window and scans the room...

It's the MINI-BAR refrigerator -- HUMMING to life.

Whip stares at the gleaming black box. The WHIR of the motor

seems to get LOUDER. Calling Whip. Beckoning him...

Whip looks at the fridge. His face is blank, His eyes tell us

nothing. Then...

Whip steps toward the box.

CLOSE ON THE MINI-BAR. Whip swings open the door.

WHOOSH -- OUR DARK SCREEN LIGHTS.

COLORS SPARKLE as a cadre of tiny liquor bottles GLOW like

jewels in a chest.

WHIP stares at the "glimmering gems" for a long, long time --

vodka, gin, wine, bourbon. The bottles SHIMMER -- AMBER,

CRYSTAL, EMERALD, RUBY.

WHIP reaches for a frosted vodka mini bottle -- he gently

pinches the neck of the bottle and lifts it out of the

fridge. He holds up the mini vodka and considers it.

Now Whip slowly removes the stopper and smells the White

Whiskey. He looks at the bottle once more, then slowly twists

the tiny cap back on.

With a look of solemn resignation, Whip places the frosted

mini bottle on top of the fridge and walks away.

WE STAY CLOSE ON THE BOTTLE. The CAMERA FOCUSES on the small

bottle as a small droplet of condensation runs down its side

-- ever so slowly, slowly. Then suddenly...

WHAP!!! In a flash, WHIP SCOOPS THE VODKA OUT OF FRAME!!

INT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL - ELEVATOR DOORS - MORNING

The ELEVATOR DOORS open and HUGH and CHARLIE step out and

head down the hallway.

We follow our guys as they approach WHIP's room, finding

OFFICER EDMONDS exactly where we left him -- in front of

WHIP's door.

EXT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL - HALLWAY - WHIP'S DOOR - DAY

OFFICER EDMONDS stands up as CHARLIE and HUGH approach

carrying coffees.

CHARLIE knocks on the door and checks his watch as he waits

for WHIP to answer. CHARLIE cocks his head, knocks again.

They all wait awkwardly as HUGH checks his watch and knocks

on the door. More silence...

CHARLIE takes the room key and lets himself in.

INT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL -- WHIP'S ROOM -- MORNING

CHARLIE carefully enters WHIP's room. He is spooked by the

silence. HUGH joins him as they take in the room. The bed

looks slept in and the room service dinner tray rests

politely on the dining table but WHIP is nowhere to be found.

CHARLIE tentatively walks around the empty room, the

bathroom, the closet, until he finally sees the adjoining

room door. He turns to HUGH with a surprised look.

CHARLIE knocks on the slightly opened adjoining door. No

response, so CHARLIE lightly tosses the door open.

INT. ADJOINING ROOM -- SAME TIME

CHARLIE looks in to find the scene of the crime. Smoke still

hangs in the air and empty bottles and cans cover every

surface in the room. HUGH joins him...

CHARLIE closes his eyes and says a silent prayer as he heads

for the bathroom...

BATHROOM -- ADJOINING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

CHARLIE is stopped by the sight of WHIP's lifeless body

wedged between the tub and the toilet.

CHARLIE turns WHIP over to see his non-responsive face. HUGH

arrives and freaks out.

CHARLIE shows immediate relief that WHIP is breathing.

OFFICER EDMONDS has joined them.

The two stare at each other and realize they are both

breathing heavily from the shock and stress of their

predicament.

EDMONDS leaves. CHARLIE and HUGH drag WHIP out of the

bathroom and flop him on the bed. HUGH explodes.

HUGH grabs at WHIP's collar and WHIP actually sits up and

reaches for HUGH, a nice sign of life from WHIP.

CHARLIE pulls HUGH away from WHIP who falls back on the bed.

129 Tell him I need bananas... 129

INT. THE. ST. JEROME HOTEL -- ELEVATOR BANK -- SAME TIME

The elevator opens and we see HARLING step from the elevator

with his knapsack over his shoulder. Teva sandals,

sunglasses.

INT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL -- WHIP'S ROOM -- MORNING

WHIP has a towel around his neck as he tries to sip coffee.

CHARLIE sits opposite him at the small table by the window.

The door bursts open, and HARLING storms in.

HARLING places a leather doctor's bag on the table. An

anxious CHARLIE reaches for the bag which sets HARLING into a

frenzy.

It's quiet as HARLING gives orders.

As they step away, HARLING now pulls a beautiful silver-

framed mirror from his bag and a blue coke grinder, he calmly

but sternly delivers orders...

HARLING Tosses a pack of smokes to CHARLIE.

HUGH takes the smokes from CHARLIE and pulls out a cigarette.

HARLING stops grinding, opens the lid and pours out a nice

smooth pile of coke. He begins a masterful ballet of cocaine

manipulation.

HUGH is removing the last quarter of an inch of tobacco from

the end of the cigarette.

HARLING uses the credit card to groom the coke into neat

piles and lines. He has a system.

WHIP's head sags as he again appears ready to pass out.

Using the mirror as a tray, HARLING holds the rolled up 20

dollar bill just above the line of coke. WHIP slowly manages

to place his face in position to ingest the coke. It's tense

as his head wobbles. He finally zeroes in and snorts the

first line. HARLING quickly switches nostrils. WHIP sniffs

the other side.

CHARLIE puts the glass of water to WHIP's mouth. WHIP

drinks.

HUGH hands HARLING the cigarette with a slightly hollowed out

tip. HARLING leans over the coke with the cigarette in his

mouth and hoovers up a small pile, sucking the coke through

the cigarette.

HARLING sits up, careful to keep the cocaine in the end of

the cigarette. He tips it up and lights it.

WHIP's head levels a look to Harling with a smile that leads

us to believe that he is actually making a rally.

HARLING takes a puff and holds it as he extends the cocaine

cigarette to WHIP. WHIP is more nimble now as he cocks his

head in acceptance of the cigarette. WHIP takes a drag and

holds it.

WHIP finally exhales the smoke, HARLING does too. WHIP

smiles.

HARLING has crafted 4 big lines now, he snorts one himself in

record time. Looks to HUGH and CHARLIE.

WHIP jumps in and sniffs 2 huge lines. He looks to HARLING.

133 The opening bars of Joe Cocker's "Feelin' Alright" crackle 133

We now see that there is a mirrored ceiling to the elevator.

WHIP tries to study his reflection in the ceiling as he holds

the hankie to his nose. WHIP begins to wobble and CHARLIE

helps him regain his balance.

INT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL-ELEVATOR LOBBY-MOMENTS LATER

Our TRIO walk as tall as they can towards the hearing room.

HUGH hustles off as CHARLIE pulls close to WHIP.

WHIP wheels on CHARLIE and unloads with focused anger...

As we disappear in to WHIP's weary eyes we hear the

distinctive sound of a jetliner screaming through the air.

INT. THE ST. JEROME HOTEL - BALL ROOM - NTSB HEARING-DAY

On TWO LARGE SCREENS we watch the grainy cell phone footage

shot by a witness of SOUTHJET FLIGHT 227's final moments in

the sky. ACCOMPANYING the Video is the REAL AUDIO of the

cockpit voice recording...

The room has a dais where the NTSB board members sit. A

large blue curtain is the backing for the round NTSB shield

that hangs above the proceedings. A large drop down screen

will show images, graph and text as needed by the NTSB.

A confident woman, ELLEN BLOCK, approaches carrying a file

which she lays on the podium.

We see WHIP who looks rough but stable in his witness chair.

ELLEN points to the screen...

An NTSB animation shows the plane pitching down and we follow

it through the inversion of the plane while listening to the

real audio of the flight crew.

The animation has a split screen that also shows the

instruments and printed text of what's being said.

We hear..."What's your son's name?" "Why?" "The black box"

"I love you, Trevor. Be a good boy, Mommy loves you." "What

are we doing?! Why would I trim down?!" "We're gonna roll

it. Ready? Here we go. I've got control."

That last statement seems to echo as the presentation stops

and the lights come back up. We return to the hearing in

progress.

WHIP is clearly struggling in his chair. The coke got him

there but it may start to fail him soon.

We hear a smattering of applause as the facts of his actions

are remarkable.

WHIP looks ashen as the booze and chemicals are still

coursing through his exhausted frame.

WHIP glances towards HUGH and CHARLIE who are poker-faced.

WHIP takes a minute to digest this question.

WHIP goes quiet as ELLEN BLOCK looks at him over her glasses,

seeing if he has any reaction. WHIP smiles.

HUGH is frozen in a steely gaze; CHARLIE seems to hold his

breath.

ELLEN points her remote at the projector but it doesn't work.

She shrugs and heads down onto the stage closer to WHIP where

she can advance the slides by touching the projector.

We now see a screen where a slide is showing a long metal

screw the size of a trombone.

AN ANIMATION SHOWS THE TAIL ASSEMBLY.

We watch the elevator acting as a wing on the tail that goes

up or down and makes a plane get lift or descend.

Everyone goes quiet as those words resonate. ELLEN's tone

changes as she understands how hard this is for some people

to hear as they think of their loved ones spending their last

living minutes on this earth in sheer terror.

It is deathly quiet in the ballroom. Even the PRESS are

silent.

A genuine applause spreads from the hearing room. ELLEN

BLOCK allows this moment to happen.

WHIP is fading, dazed and uncomfortable with the unexpected

adulation. He stands up.

The room gets quiet as WHIP's demeanor seems terse.

WHIP stares at ELLEN, white with sweat and chemicals. We see

HUGH grind his jaw as this line of questioning has him on

tilt.

WHIP nods.

WHIP takes his time.

HUGH AND CHARLIE

Sit stone faced in the second row feeling the relief of

months of hard work.

ELLEN BLOCK continues with a rote posture...

ELLEN wraps up this line of questions...

WHIP waits for her to look at him...this takes a while...

HUGH maintains a poker face; CHARLIE appears relieved.

ELLEN sorts through her notes one last time.

Slides now show the TWO SMALL VODKA BOTTLES in evidence.

A SOUTHJET CORPORATE PHOTO OF WHIP pops on to the large

monitors. After ELLEN references a member of the flight

crew, their photo pops on to the monitors...

KATERINA MARQUEZ PHOTO does not pop up on the screen...yet.

Hugh smiles -- satisfied.

A picture of Trina's beautiful smiling face FLASHES UP ON THE

BIG SCREEN.

WHIP smiles at the photo of TRINA as if she can see him. He

then shakes his head to snap from the memory of her great

spirit. He gets serious as he bears his look down on ELLEN.

Whip shakes. He runs his trembling hand through his hair.

Whip drops his head and MUTTERS SOMETHING INAUDIBLE.

A confused MUMBLE rises in the room. Whip's response

flusters ELLEN for a moment, but she recovers quickly.

Whip cuts her off...

Whip stops. His whole body trembles, his face tightens. He

looks right at ELLEN...

The crowd gasps, unsure of what they just heard...

CHARLIE rockets out of his chair.

Now CHARLIE returns to his chair to find that HUGH is gone.

CHARLIE looks around for HUGH, no sign. He's vanished.

WHIP leans close to the microphone.

Chaos erupts further as REPORTERS outnumber SECURITY. Flash

bulbs pop repeatedly and large lights are aimed at the fracas

on stage as video is taken of the bizarre melee.

We have pushed into a tight shot on WHIP's face as the sound

in the room fades away. We stay tight on WHIP's face as he

lets the moments unfold.

Suddenly the noise cuts to silence. WHIP is looking at the

assembly. WHIP wipes tears from his eyes. We hear WHIP's

voice as the dialogue pre-laps the image of his face.

A new angle shows WHIP speaking these words...

We hear laughter as we pull out from WHIP to realize that he

is in fact wearing a white penal jumpsuit and leading an AA

meeting in a Federal Prison.

INT. MCRAE FEDERAL PENITENTIARY -- GEORGIA -- DAY

A large room houses an AA meeting for about 50 inmates

wearing white jumpsuits. WHIP continues his story.

Whip gives it to us straight...

We hold close on WHIP's face as we hear the metallic clang of

prison doors shutting. On the sound we cut to...

INT. FEDERAL PENITENTIARY -- CELL -- DAY

We pan across the concrete cell wall, looking at a small,

personal photo collage. We see a photo of NICOLE and SHEILA

and a few other AA FOLKS surrounding WHIP who sits in front

of a birthday cake in the common room of the prison. We see

a photo of WHIP's DAD as an airman. We ultimately land on a

photo of NICOLE. We recognize it as the photo WHIP took on

the porch of the Whitaker Farm.

We pan down to find WHIP writing in a journal. A GUARD comes

to the front of his cell.

WHIP looks at the GUARD and nods before taking a last glance

at the photo of NICOLE.

EXT. FEDERAL PENITENTIARY -- GUEST YARD -- DAY

WHIP sits at a lone picnic table in a fence-enclosed

courtyard. He checks his watch and looks up.

WHIP stands and walks towards us, towards his visitor. As he

gets closer we see a smile break across his face. A smile we

haven't seen since he first saw NICOLE. We reverse to see...

WILL -- WHIP's 17 year old son stands next to a GUARD.

Another beat as they can't find a way in to a conversation.

WHIP chokes up. WILL nods. It's intense. WHIP motions to

the table and they both sit. WILL pulls out a notebook.

WHIP studies him and laughs...WILL nods and tries to smile.

Again WHIP has to tamp down his emotions.

WILL pulls out a small voice recorder and clicks it on...

The two men just look at each other.

WILL nods, both men are struggling to keep it together.

WHIP nods, unsure as to where this is going.

WHIP smiles...a great, familiar question. He begins to

alternately laugh and sob as there is great relief in the

promise of a connection with his son.
