INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. DAY.

SKY. Over which a title "LONDON--SUMMER 1593" appears.

Title card: In the glory days of the Elizabethan theatre

two playhouses were fighting it out for writers and

audiences. North of the city was the Curtain Theatre,

home to England's most famous actor, Richard Burbage.

Across the river was the competition, built by Philip

Henslowe, a business with a cash flow problem...

...The Rose...

Gradually a building is revealed, The Rose Theatre, three-

tiered, open to the elements and empty. On the floor,

roughly printed, a poster--torn, soiled, out of date. It

says:

SEPT. 7TH & 8TH AT NOON

MR. EDWARD ALLEYN AND THE ADMIRAL'S MEN AT THE ROSE

THEATRE, BANKSIDE

THE LAMENTABLE TRAGEDIE OF THE MONEYLENDER REVENG'D

OVER THIS the screams of a man under torture. The screams

are coming from the curtained stage.

INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

The theatre owner, PHILLIP HENSLOWE, is the man

screaming. HENSLOWE'S boots are on fire. He is pinioned

in a chair, with his feet stuck out over the hot colas of

a fire burning in a brazier. He is being held in that

position by LAMBERT, who is a thug employed by FENNYMAN,

who is the owner of the VOICE. The fourth man, FREES, is

FENNYMAN'S bookkeeper.

FENNYMAN snaps his fingers at FREES and LAMBERT. LAMBERT

unties HENSLOWE, FREES starts writing a contract.

FENNYMAN slaps a contract down on the table next to n ink-

pot and quill.

HENSLOWE takes the quill and signs.

INT. WILL'S ROOM. DAY

A small cramped space in the eaves of a building. A

cluttered shelf containing various objects, wedged

between crumpled pieces of paper. Among those we have

time to observe: a skull, a mug that says A PRESENT FROM

STRATFORD-UPON-AVON.

At infrequent intervals further pieces of crumpled paper

are tossed towards the shelf. The man who is throwing

them, WILL SHAKESPEARE, is bent over a table, writing

studiously with a quill.

Now we see what he is writing: Will is practising his

signature, over and over again. "Will Shagsbeard...W

Shakspur...William Shasper..." Each time he is dissatisfied,

and each time he crumples, and tosses it away.

Suddenly WILL becomes impatient. He jumps up and goes to

the loft area in the rafters, where he sleeps, and starts

to pull on his boots. At this point the door opens and

HENSLOWE walks in. He is out of breath and his feet hurt.

EXT. STREET. OUTSIDE WILL'S HOUSE. DAY.

WILL lives in a crowded area of the city. Hawkers are

crying their wares, tract-sellers, delivery boys, and

merchants go about their business. HENSLOWE catches up

with WILL as he strides purposefully along.

EXT. ANOTHER STREET. DAY

HENSLOWE'S hardly paused in his appeal.

WILL stops.

WILL turns down a side street.

EXT. MARKETPLACE. DAY.

HENSLOWE and WILL are crossing a crowded marketplace

where a Puritan preacher, MAKEPEACE, is haranguing anyone

who will listen.

As he passes WILL gratefully makes a mental note.

EXT. DR. MOTH'S HOUSE. DAY.

WILL turns into a narrow street and walks toward a

doorway.

As HENSLOWE arrives the door closes in his face. A sign

identifies the place as the premises of Dr. MOTH,

apothecary, alchemist, astrologer, seer, interpreter of

dreams, and priest of psyche. HENSLOWE looks puzzled.

INT. DR. MOTH'S HOUSE. DAY

A stuffed alligator hangs from the ceiling, pills,

potions, amulets and charms, star charts and mystic

paraphernalia festoon the place. Testimonials and framed

degrees hang on the walls.

WILL lying on a couch, on his back. His eyes are closed

DR. MOTH sits by the couch, listening to WILL and

occasionally making a note on a pad he holds on his knee.

What we have here is nothing less than the false dawn of

analysis. The session is being timed by an hourglass.

WILL seems unwiling to respond. DR. MOTH refers to his

notes.

WILL turns towards him. How did he know that?

The sand runs through the hourglass.

DR. MOTH reaches for a glass snake bracelet.

WILL looks at the snake bangle in wonder.

He holds out his hand. WILL drops a sovereign into it,

and takes the bracelet.

EXT. DR. MOTH'S HOUSE. DAY.

WILL comes out. HENSLOWE is waiting, standing in a horse

trough to ease his feet. WILL walks straight past him,

and HENSLOWE follows.

INT. WHITEHALL PALACE. BACKSTAGE. DAY.

WHITEHALL means nothing yet. We are behind closed

curtains on a stage busy with preparations for the

imminent performance of Two Gentlemen of Verona. This is

not a theatre but a banqueting hall, as we will see.

RICHARD BURBAGE is to play "PROTEUS." A BOY PLAYER will

play "SILVIA," and last minute improvements to his makeup

etc. are being applied by BURBAGE'S mistress ROSALINE.

"LAUNCE," one of the clowns, is the famous comedian WILL

KEMPE. "LAUNCE'S" dog, CRAB is in KEMPE'S charge and is

not helping much. There is no set. A helpful placard

reading VERONA--AN OPEN PLACE, is ready to hand. MUSICIANS

can be heard tuning their instruments. From the other

side of the curtain there is an expectant bubbub. KEMPE

leads the dog into the wings and rummages in a box of

proops. He finds a skull. He has one foot on the box, his

elbow on his knee, he looks at the skull...in other words

he reminds us of Hamlet. We see this from the POV of

WILL, who is just entering through a door backstage.

WILL'S attention has been caught by ROSALINE, BURBAGE'S

mistress. ROSALINE is big breasted, dark-eyed, dark-

haired, sexual.

BURBAGE kisses her mouth and slaps her behind. He comes

over to greet WILL.

ROSALINE brings over the last elements of BURBAGE'S

costume and helps him into them.

BURBAGE digs under his costume for his purse, which is on

a waistband, over his corset.

WILL turns to see HENSLOWE approaching.

The Master of the Revels (TILNEY) comes through the

curtain officiously.

He disappears back through the curtains. The hubbub falls

silent, rather dramatically, and all the busy PLAYERS

know what that means: they all crowd to the curtain and

find places to peep through.

INT. WHITEHALL PALACE. BANQUETING HALL. FRONT OF

HOUSE/STAGE. DAY.

THE POV OF THE PLAYERS.

The arrival of QUEEN ELIZABETH, aged sixty, coming to

take her place in the audience at front centre. The hill

is crowded with lords and ladies, bowing ELIZABETH to her

seat, which is raised high on a pedestal, affording the

QUEEN an uninterrupted view of the play, and the audience

an uninterrupted view of the QUEEN. Trumpets sound.

Close on a small piece of paper: a quill is writing "W.

Shakespeare." WILL rolls the paper up carefully and slips

it into the mouth of the snake bangle.

The curtain draws back and CONDELL as "VALENTINE" and

BURBAGE as "PROTEUS" begin the play.

INT. WHITEHALL PALACE. BANQUETING HALL. THE

WINGS/BACKSTAGE. DAY.

With BURBAGES'S presence accounted for on stage, ROSALINE

curls an arm around WILL'S neck. They kiss hungrily.

After a moment, WILL pulls back.

WILL takes the snake bracelet and slips it onto her arm.

ROSALINE looks at it, then at WILL. Then they kiss again,

but WILL is distracted by the sound of coughing from the

auditorium.

INT. WHITEHALL PALACE. BANQUETING HALL. STAGE. DAY.

"VALENTINE" is on stage with "PROTEUS."

CONDELL AS VALENTINE

"To be in love, where scorn is bought with groans: Coy

looks with heart sore sighs; One fading moment's mirth

With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights..."

As the scene continues, WILL appears at the back of the

hall and finds himself next to HENSLOWE.

INT. WHITEHALL PALACE. BACK OF THE BANQUETING HALL/STAGE.

DAY.

Laughter. It is later, and KEMPE is now on stage with his

dog. The audience is roaring.

QUEEN ELIZABETH'S idiosyncratic laugh rises above the

others.

She throws a sweetheart on the stage and the dog wolfs it

down. Everyone applauds.

Now we meet VIOLA. VIOLA DE LESSEPS is twenty-five and

beautiful, and she is laughing with great natural

enjoyment. She sits slightly apart from her small family

group--her parents, SIR ROBERT DE LESSEPS and LADY

MARGARET DE LESSEPS. Part of the group but seated behind

as befits her lower status is VIOLA'S NURSE.

Elsewhere is LORD WESSEX, our villain. WESSEX is in his

forties, dark cruel, self-important. He has noticed

VIOLA. The nurse notices him.

INT. WHITEHALL PALACE. BANQUETING HALL. FRONT OF

HOUSE/STAGE. DAY.

LATER. "VALENTINE" is on stage alone. He is speaking the

speech rather more coarsely than the version we hear

later.

Now we see that VIOLA knows the speech by heart, and is

silently mouthing it with the actor.

But when he turns to WILL he finds that WILL has gone.

INT. WILL'S ROOM. DAY.

WILL comes into his room, goes straight to his table in

the window, and arranges pen, ink, and paper. Now he has

his ritual: he spins round once in a circle, rubs his

hands together and spits on the floor. Then he sits down,

picks up his pen, and stares in front of him. PAUSE. Then

he begins to write.

INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.

The NURSE is undressing her, though VIOLA tries

intermittently to push her away. She is still bright with

excitement.

Now the NURSE is cleaning VIOLA'S ears, one by one, of

course. She has an ear-cleaning implement for this. VIOLA

submits.

VIOLA goes over to the window.

INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.

The NURSE thrusts a twig to her face.

Automatically, VIOLA takes the twig and begins brushing

her teeth, all the while looking downriver towards the

Rose. The NURSE attends her with a beaker of water, and a

bowl.

VIOLA gazes longingly towards the Rose... And, there and

then, she makes a plan.

EXT. SQUARE IN FRONT OF THE ROSE THEATRE. DAY.

HENSLOWE is making his way from the theatre to the market

place when FENNYMAN and LAMBERT appear at either shoulder

and propel him back the way he came. FREES follows

behind.

At this point din is heard in the background. a

messenger, ringing a bell, is running though the street.

FENNYMAN is intrigued.

HENSLOWE plays his temporary advantage modestly,

shrugging himself free of LAMBERT'S grip.

HENSLOWE continues on his way. FENNYMAN watches HENSLOWE,

curious.

INT. WILL'S ROOM. DAY.

It is. WILL is writing furiously. A burnt-down candle is

still alight, although it is day outside the window. He

has been writing all night. He has written about ten

pages. Pleased with himself and excited, he gathers them

up and leaves the room like a man with a mission.

EXT. WILL'S HOUSE. DAY.

Leaving the house, pages in hand, WILL nearly knocks down

HENSLOWE who has come to see him.

Before he can finish, WILL brandishes the pages in his

hand.

WILL has gone.

EXT. BURBAGE'S HOUSE. DAY.

BURBAGE lives in another part of the city. WILL bangs

through the door without ceremony.

INT. BURBAGE'S HOUSE. DAY.

WILL enters and calls out.

INT. BURBAGE'S BEDROOM. DAY.

WILL charges into the bedroom. ROSALINE is in bed. The

Master of the Revels is pulling up his breeches. WILL is

shattered.

The unsuccessful snake bracelet glints at him from

ROSALINE'S arm.

A bell can be heard ringing outside.

EXT. STREET. OUTSIDE BURBAGE'S HOUSE. DAY.

WILL emerges looking distraught. A burning brazier stands

by the wall. WILL thrusts the pages into the coals. He

watches for a moment as the pages catch fire.

INT. TAVERN. DAY.

WILL walks in to find the place in an uproar of

celebration. A handsome young serving man (NOL) is

bumping through with a tray of tankards.

HENSLOWE finds a seat, and takes a tankard off NOL'S

tray.

They are interrupted by WILL who joins them. He looks

distracted.

NOL shouts for you, takes off his apron and flings it

behind the bar. HENSLOWE jumps up and embraces WILL. The

entire staff and half the customers are now crowding

around, actors the lot of them. HENSLOWE bangs the table

to shut them all up.

The din of excited chatter returns. He sweeps grandly to

the tavern door...where he meets RALPH BASHFORD, a big,

burly, middle-aged actor.

INT. TAVERN. DAY.

WILL has remained behind, aghast now at his predicament.

He goes to the bar.

WILL turns towards a figure further down the bar. It's

CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE.

His drink arrives. WILL places a sovereign on the bar.

NOL hurries back to WILL'S side.

He drains his glass.

WILL makes a helpless gesture and hurries after NOL.

INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. GALLERY/STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY.

HENSLOWE and WILL are sitting in the gallery, listening

to a YOUNG ACTOR auditioning.

HENSLOWE and WILL look a bit deflated. The YOUNG ACTOR

leaves and is replaced by a SECOND ACTOR.

HENSLOWE and WILL let him continue a bit further, but

exchange despairing looks. A succession of would-be

actors offer their version of Marlowe's lines, each as

inappropriate as the other. Among them is a small URCHIN.

The URCHIN leaves, glowering furiously, and is replaced

by a beanpole of a man (WASBASH). WABASH has a bad

stutter.

WILL looks at HENSLOWE in outrage.

HENSLOWE leaves him.

WILL sits brooding alone for a moment. Then he realizes

he is being addressed from the stage. ANOTHER ACTOR.

WILL looks at the stage and sees a handsome young man,

with a hat shadowing his eyes.

WILL can hardly manage a nod.

It does not take four lines of "VALENTINE'S" speech to

confirm for us, if confirmation be needed, that THOMAS is

VIOLA. For WILL, amazement at hearing his own words soon

gives away to something else. He is captivated. He has

found his "ROMEO".

WILL interrupts "him."

THOMAS begins to panic. WILL jumps down to ground level.

THOMAS runs offstage, to WILL'S bewilderment. WILL

hurries after him. We go with WILL as he crosses the

stage, then backstage, then into the

INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. RETIRING ROOM. DAY.

RETIRING ROOM which is crowded with actors and HENSLOWE'S

lieutenant, property manager, copier, and general

factotum who is a new character, PETER.

WILL enters into the middle of this.

NOBODY knows what he is talking about. WABASH, the

stutterer, grabs Will's hand and shakes it excitedly.

The street door is swinging shut. WILL sees it. He fights

his way through the men to get to the door.

EXT. THE ROSE THEATRE. BANKSIDE. DAY.

WILL emerges from the theatre into a street throbbing

with nefarious life. Whores, cutpurses, hawkers, urchins,

tract-sellers, riffraff of all kinds in an area of stews

(lowdown pubs), brothels and slums. It is some time

before WILL spots THOMAS, way ahead of him in the crowded

street. The chase is taking them to the riverbank.

EXT. THE RIVER. DAY.

When WILL gets to the riverbank he sees that THOMAS is in

a smallish boat being rowed upriver and in midstream. The

river is quite busy, and among the boats there are a

number of waiting "taxis." WILL jumps into the nearest

one and shouts at the "Taxi Driver" BOATMAN.

WILL sits in the stern of the boat and the BOATMAN sits

facing him, rowing lustily.

EXT. THE RIVER. DAY.

LATER. The BOATMAN is puffing. WILL is looking ahead to

where THOMAS'S boat has reached a jetty on the farther

shore, a private jetty attached to a rich house on the

north bank. WILL sees THOMAS jump out of his boat and run

toward the house.

EXT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. DAY.

WILL runs towards the house.

INT. DE LESSEPSES'S HOUSE. DAY.

THOMAS rushes up the back stairs, removing his hat. Her

hair tumbles down about her shoulders, so we will call

her VIOLA again.

INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. DAY.

Her mother LADY DE LESSEPS, is talking to the NURSE.

LADY DE LESSEPS

Where is she? Our guests are upon us, Lord Wessex too,

bargaining for a bride. My husband will have it settled

tonight.

Behind her, the door opens revealing VIOLA as THOMAS to

the NURSES view, but only for a moment. The door closes

again as LADY DE LESSEPS turns.

A different door communicating to the next room, opens

and VIOLA comes in after a lightning dress change into a

robe. She curtseys to her mother.

The NURSE looks at her, round-eyed.

INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. KITCHEN. DAY.

From a cauldron on the stove, hot water is poured into

two pails, by the a KITCHEN BOY under the NURSE'S

command.

WILL has come to the kitchen door with a letter.

The NURSE sends the SCULLERY MAID back to work.

INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BATHROOM. EVENING.

VIOLA in her bath, reads WILL'S letter. The NURSE is

adding hot water to the tub.

EXT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. NIGHT.

WILL waits hopefully. The kitchen door opens and a

SERVANT flings a bucket of dirty water in the general

direction of the gutter. WILL hops nimbly aside and

escapes a soaking.

INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.

The NURSE is helping VIOLA into her party dress.

EXT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. NIGHT.

WILL spots a gaggle of MUSICIANS approaching, carrying

instruments. WILL recognizes them.

The sound of hooves gives hardly any warning as a

GALLOPING HORSEMAN thunders through the MUSICIANS who

have to leap out of the way. It is WESSEX arriving at the

house, with his usual good manners. Will watches WESSEX

skid to a halt and enter the house.

INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. BANQUETING ROOM. NIGHT.

WILL has got in with the MUSICIANS. Competently enough he

strums along with them on the bandstand. Two dozen guests

are enough to crowd the space for dancing. WILL glances

around, looking for THOMAS KENT. He stops a passing

SERVANT, helping himself to a snack off the man's tray.

It means nothing to the SERVANT who moves on. ANGLE ON

WESSEX and SIR ROBERT.

ANGLE on WILL--watching the dancing. Then he sees VIOLA in

the crowd. He turns to blood.

Love at first sight, no doubt about it. VIOLA has not

seen him. She is doing a daughter's duty among her

parents' friends. The guests form up to begin a changing-

partners dance (the very same one you get in every ROMEO

and JULIET).

WILL leaves the bandstand and is moving trancelike to

keep her in view between the dancers and onlookers. VIOLA

moves through patterns of the dance until...as night

follows day, she finds WILL opposite her. He has

insinuated himself into the dance. VIOLA gasps.

WILL reacts, surprised by her reaction. The dance

separates them. VIOLA finds herself opposite WESSEX.

WESSEX scowls. The dance separates them. VIOLA finds

herself opposite WILL again. WILL stares at her

entranced.

WILL has lost his tongue.

WILL nods in his trance and she smiles at him.

WILL tries to speak but the silver tongue won't work. He

is dumb with adoration. Suddenly WESSEX takes him affably

by the elbow and leads him into an alcove.

To his surprise he finds a lordly dagger at this throat.

WESSEX shoves him through the nearest door.

VIOLA'S eyes are searching the room for WILL. She finds

WESSEX smiling at her. She looks away.

EXT. DE LESSEPS' GARDEN/VIOLA'S BALCONY. NIGHT

There is a lighted window on the balcony. VIOLA, dressed

for bed, and the NURSE pass across the lighted space.

WILL is in the garden. He sees her. The light in the room

is extinguished. WILL sighs. Then VIOLA comes out onto

the balcony in the moonlight. WILL gasps. He watches her.

VIOLA sighs dreamily.

WILL reckons that's a good enough cue. He comes out of

hiding, and approaches the balcony.

The NURSE calls "Madam!" from inside the room.

The NURSE calls again.

She goes inside for a moment.

VIOLA returns. WILL comes forward again.

The NURSE calls her again: "Madam!"

But she goes inside. WILL looks around and sees that

there is, as ever a convenient tree. He starts to climb

up toward the balcony. When his head is nearly level, a

soft figure comes once more onto the balcony. WILL pops

his head over the parapet and is face to face with the

NURSE. The NURSE gives a yell. WILL falls out of the

tree.

EXT. DE LEESEPSES' HOUSE. NIGHT.

Male voice shout to each other inside the house, candle

flames appear in different windows, the garden door is

flung open, revealing SIR ROBERT with candelabra in one

hand and sword in the other. By this time WILL is on top

of the garden wall and he drops safely out of sight. He

could have written it better.

INT. WILL'S ROOM. DAWN.

WILL is burning the midnight oil--literally and

metaphorically. His quill has already covered a dozen

sheets. He is inspired.

INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY.

It is day one. THE COMPANY is on stage. PETER is passing

pages around a bunch of actors. JOHN, JAMES, and NOL are

looking through their pages.

WILL is going around pumping hands and slapping

shoulders, flushed with excitement. HENSLOWE is reading

his pages, worried. RALPH BASHFORD is next to him.

WILL pulls HENSLOWE aside.

WILL as notices a young scruffy thirteen-year-old actor,

the URCHIN we met before.

And he helps the URCHIN off with a kick. The URCHIN

glowers with resentment. HENSLOWE finds himself face to

face with FENNYMAN.

That's as far as he gets before there is a dramatic

interruption--the public entrance door is flung open and

SIX MEN make a loud entrance, headed by NED ALLEYN, the

actor, who is a handsome piratical figure with a big

voice and a big sword.

He gets various reactions. HENSLOWE and WILL shout his

name joyfully, some of the actors are friends with the

new group and behave accordingly, others know they are

out of a job. FENNYMAN recovers, or tries to.

ALLEYN slaps him aside with his sword.

FENNYMAN is impressed.

Half a dozen of the ADMIRAL'S MEN will be given roles in

our play and we meet them and identify them as WILL

enthusiastically shakes hands.

He leaves, passing by the humbled FENNYMAN.

WILL is used to it. He goes.

EXT. RIVERBANK. DAY.

WILL arrives in a hurry at the wharfside, and looks

vainly in the direction of the DE LESSEPSES' house: no

THOMAS.

EXT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE DOOR. DAY.

WILL looks down the alley:--no THOMAS. He turns away. The

URCHIN, the short-lived Ethel, is sitting in the alley.

The URCHIN nods grimly.

Because a stray cat is nearby. The cat show an interest.

The URCHIN passes a white mouse to the cat and watches

the result with sober interest.

WILL backs away, unnerved by the boy.

INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY.

On stage . . . the actors carry their parts.

NOL AS BENVOLIO

"See where he comes. So please you step aside; I'll know

his grievance or be much denied."

Onstage "MONTAGUE" and "LADY MONTAGUE" make their exit.

Offstage, WILL appears next to HENSLOWE.

The voice is THOMAS'S. WILL turns back to the stage and

sees him. Today THOMAS has a wig as well as his small

mustache.

The rehearsal stops.

Alone in the auditorium, FENNYMAN looks and listens,

fascinated. So this is theatre!

NED ALLEYN comes out of the wings, frowning over his

manuscript.

WILL moves back into the wings where HENSLOWE is looking

anxious.

WILL moves on, ignoring him. As he goes, we see that

VIOLA is love-struck by him, a riot in the heart.

INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. STAIRCASE. DAY.

VIOLA still dressed as THOMAS, sonnet in hand, runs up

the stairs to her room. From the other end of the house

WESSEX can be heard ranting.

INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. HALL. NIGHT.

LORD WESSEX is being kept waiting. The NURSE is bearing

the brunt of his impatience.

VIOLA opens the door. She has changed hurriedly--too

hurriedly: the effect of her glorious hair falling to her

bare shoulders is spoiled by her mustache. Fortunately,

the NURSE spots her before WESSEX does and by coming

forward to greet her, the NURSE manages to shield Viola

from view, communicate the problem, and announce WESSEX'S

presence, so that by the time the NURSE has passed by

VIOLA and let herself out of the room, the moustache has

disappeared.

He kisses her with more passion than ceremony. VIOLA

recoils, and slaps him.

INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.

She is writing to WILL. His letter-poem is on her table.

We can read part of it. "Shall I compare thee to a

summer's day..."

Now we see what VIOLA is writing.

INSERT: "Master Will, poet dearest to my heart, I beseech

you, banish me from yours--I am to marry Lord Wessex-- a

daughter's duty... "

She sheds a romantic, unhappy tear.

INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

SAM is now "JULIET." The play has evidently reached Act I

Scene 5. We are witnessing the meeting of "ROMEO" and

"JULIET" in a simplified version of the changing-partners

dance we saw at VIOLA'S house. NED ALLEYN is in charge.

The dance goes wrong. it is THOMAS'S fault.

THOMAS mutters a blushing apology. WILL arrives the

bystanders, clutching fresh pages. He gives these to

PETER. NED ALLEYN sees him and comes over to start an

argument.

WILL points significantly at the pages he has given

PETER.

NED nods satisfied and turns back to work. Then he turns

back.

But the author has escaped.

INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. WRITER'S CORNER. DAY.

Up aloft, WILL has a Writer's Corner where he settle down

to work. We see his private superstition: he spins round

in a circle, rubs his hands together, and spits on the

floor. That done, he picks up his pen.

EXT. STREET. NIGHT.

WILL is charging down a narrow alley, and bumps into

BURBAGE who is emerging from the door of a tavern.

WILL is in too much of a hurry to stop. BURBAGE calls

after him.

WILL hurries on.

EXT. RIVERBANK. DUSK.

VIOLA as THOMAS is being rowed across the river. From

behind, in the direction of Bankside, "he" hears

shouting.

VIOLA as THOMAS turns to see WILL some way behind,

following in another boat. She takes a letter from her

coat and holds it aloft.

EXT. THE RIVER. VIOLA'S BOAT. NIGHT.

WILL has climbed aboard VIOLA'S boat and is tearing open

the letter. What he reads causes him great pain. He

collapses into the stern seat next to VIOLA.

WILL turns on him savagely

EXT. THE RIVER. VIOLA'S BOAT. NIGHT.

WILL turns back to VIOLA. They have their conversation

intimately, disregarding the lack of intimacy. The

BOATMAN is hardly an arm's length away, but they ignore

him.

He is looking into VIOLA'S eyes. She holds his look, but

WILL belies his words.

The boat scrapes on the jetty of the DE LESSEPSES' house.

The bump throws THOMAS into WILL'S arms. He holds her

round the shoulders. His words have almost unmasked her.

The closeness does the rest. She kisses him on the mouth

and jumps out of the boat.

She throws a coin to the BOATMAN and runs towards the

house.

WILL gets out of the boat.

The BOATMAN produces his memoirs in manuscript.

But WILL has gone.

EXT. DE LESSEPSES' GARDEN. NIGHT.

WILL drops over the wall into the garden and without

hesitation starts climbing up to her balcony.

INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.

WILL comes in through the window, just as VIOLA enters by

the door. They stare at each other across the room.

They run together and fall into a passionate kiss.

They run together and fall into a passionate kiss. VIOLA

fumbles with his clothing, he with hers.

INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. OUTSIDE VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.

The NURSE has come to listen. She puts her ear against

the door. Because she hears muffled voices, she looks

startled.

INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.

WILL is half-naked. VIOLA is down to her petticoat, and

chemise. The petticoat comes away. WILL flings it aside.

He takes off her chemise. He is startled to find that she

is tightly bandaged round the bosom. WILL finds the loose

end and spins her naked.

INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. OUTSIDE VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.

The NURSE, drags a chair--a rocker--outside the bedroom

door, and takes up her position. She sits down, keeping

guard. Pretty soon there comes the regular creak of

VIOLA'S bed. The NURSE fans herself furiously with her

little lacy fan. She crosses herself. A CHAMBERMAID comes

along the gallery outside the bedroom door. She is

dusting her way along. The CHAMBERMAID becomes aware of

the regular creaking. She pauses. The NURSE begins to

rock in her chair, keeping time with the creaking from

within. The CHAMBERMAID stares at the NURSE. The NURSE

stares at the CHAMBERMAID.

INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT

WILL and VIOLA have finished making love, and lie in each

other's arms.

EXT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. DAWN.

Dawn is breaking. The sun lacing the severing clouds with

envious streaks.

INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. OUTSIDE VIOLA'S BEDROOM. DAWN

The NURSE has fallen asleep in her rocking chair.

INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. DAWN.

A rooster crows at some distance. VIOLA and WILL are in

bed. She stirs drowsily. VIOLA, coming awake, speaks his

name and he kisses her.

Then he starts to get out of bed.

She is winning. She kisses him and pulls the bedclothes

around them.

He kisses her and starts to make love to her again. VIOLA

gives him a shove which pushes him onto the floor. She

sits up and pulls on her gown.

There's a knock at the door.

INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE VIOLA'S

BEDROOM/VIOLA'S BEDROOM. DAWN.

The NURSE is knocking. VIOLA comes to the door.

VIOLA looks beautified by the hours that have passed.

INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY.

The cut is to the middle of a rehearsal. We are coming up

to the moment when "ROMEO" and "JULIET" kiss for the

first time (Act I Scene V) NED ALLEYN is in charge but

WILL is watching. His life has turned perfect.

WILL is in her eye-line. Her eyes flash an intimate

secret look to him.

And VIOLA misses her cue as a result.

VIOLA guiltily picks up her line.

In character, VIOLA kisses SAM, demurely, but apparently

not demurely enough for WILL, who gives a twitch.

VIOLA kisses SAM again. WILL gives a major twitch, which

in fact catapults his body onto the stage. Everybody

looks at him in surprise.

VIOLA kisses WILL. They lose themselves for a fraction of

a moment. As VIOLA withdraws her lips, WILL'S lips are

going for it again.

RALPH has been ready and waiting.

WILL has retreated to

INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. DAY.

He is behind the curtain now.

During RALPH'S lines (which are continuous) WILL stands

in the shadow behind the curtain, alone, agitated.

INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

RALPH AS NURSE

"I tell you, he that can lay hold of her (he makes the

money sign) Shall have the chinks."

NOL, AS "BENVOLIO," at a party, carrying a goblet, tipsy,

enters the scene.

VIOLA, about to make her exit, has her hand holding the

curtain at the gap.

INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. BEHIND THE CURTAIN. DAY.

WILL is kissing her hand.

INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. BEHIND THE CURTAIN. DAY.

VIOLA comes through the curtain. WILL and VIOLA kiss,

dangerously--they are in a narrow space, hidden from the

general backstage area.

INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. BEHIND THE CURTAIN. DAY.

"JULIET'S" line bits WILL between the eyes. WILL pulls

away.

INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. DAY.

As WILL races up the ladder to his writer's corner, the

rehearsal can be heard continuing.

INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. WRITER'S CORNER. DAY.

WILL arrives at the top of the building in his writer's

corner. He spins around once in a circle, rubs his hands

together and spits on the floor. His manuscript is all

over the table.

We take a peak at the lines he has already written.

INSERT MANUSCRIPT: "But soft, what light through yonder

window breaks? It is the east and Juliet is the sun."

VIOLA'S VOICE OVER speaks the line.

INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. EVENING.

VIOLA is in bed, reading the lines from the manuscript

page. WILL is in bed with her, reading with her.

She has to speak through WILL'S kisses, he is nibbling at

her neck and shoulders and she has to bat him away with

the pages.

INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

VIOLA continues the speech, edge-to-edge, now in

rehearsal, with SAM as "JULIET" sighing on the balcony

above her.

Oh speak again bright angel..."

We have abandoned real time. The scene continues CROSS

CUT between the STAGE and VIOLA'S BED.

INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. EVENING.

INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. DAY

INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.

WILL and VIOLA in bed.

INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM. NIGHT.

It's become late and the rehearsal is continuing by

torchlight.

We see that a group of the other actors have drifted "out

front," drawn by the scene. FENNYMAN is there entranced.

Clearly, this stuff is a cut above the normal.

INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT

WILL, undressed, strides around the room, feeding

"JULIET'S" lines to VIOLA in bed.

INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. NIGHT.

INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.

WILL and VIOLA are both out of bed, halfway though

dressing. Still rehearsing.

INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. NIGHT.

INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.

WILL and VIOLA are back on the bed, kissing and making

love.

Outside the NURSE is knocking on the door and calling.

INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

RALPH, the Nurse, call's "JULIET!" off stage.

INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT

INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. OUTSIDE VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.

The NURSE listens at the door.

INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.

VIOLA slaps him playfully for his vulgarity, and then

kisses him.

INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

SAM leaves the balcony through the curtain.

INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.

It is night. They have just made love. Suddenly it is

very still.

Being in night, all this but a dream, Too flattering-

sweet to be substantial."

INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. DAY.

Onstage, the scene continues. Backstage NED ALLEYN is

working his way upstairs. He passes by RALPH (the Nurse)

who has a couple of words "of," as it were, in "JULIET'S"

chamber.

SAM exits (i.e. enters to us) through the curtain.

INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. WRITER'S CORNER. DAY.

NED is arriving. WILL is busy writing. PETER is there,

holding the pages WILL has completed, and waiting for

WILL to finish his page. PETER is reading his pages. WILL

sees NED arrive. He gives his page to PETER.

Typical!, says WILL'S face. Peter departs, leaving the

field to NED. WILL braces himself.

The whole exchange is in ironic code, between old

soldiers. NED nods curtly and turns to descend.

INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY.

PETER is just handing the pages HENSLOWE in the

auditorium. HENSLOWE has acquired a performing dog. The

dog does somersaults tirelessly. As PETER hands over the

pages, he shakes his head.

FENNYMAN, the born-again theatre groupie shushes HENSLOWE

and looks daggers at him.

FENNYMAN can't hear it. He storms over. Kicks the dog,

roars at HENSLOWE .

INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. MORNING.

A sunbeam wakes the lovers. Sunday morning. Church bells.

VIOLA wakes with a start. Something is bothering her, she

can't think what. WILL calms her.

He brings her back down to the pillow.

Suddenly there is a great racket heard from downstairs...a

man shouting.

VIOLA remembers. She jumps up and gives a cry.

INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. OUTSIDE VIOLA'S BEDROOM.

MORNING.

The NURSE is barring the stairs to WESSEX.

INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. MORNING.

VIOLA has her dress on and is putting on her shoes. WILL,

in his underwear is in mid-argument.

INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. OUTSIDE VIOLA'S BEDROOM

DOWNSTAIRS HALL. MORNING.

The ranting from WESSEX has continued

And is cut off short as VIOLA'S door opens at the top of

the stairs.

VIOLA comes down the stairs. Behind her WILL appears

gowned and bonneted. He has also assumed a country

accent.

EXT. GREENWICH PALACE. NIGHT.

Fireworks explode in the evening sky over Greenwich, a

royal palace, crowded now with noble guests.

EXT. GREENWICH PALACE. TERRACE. NIGHT.

The way these royal routs work is that guest mill about,

chatting, bowing and generally behaving gallantly, while

QUEEN ELIZABETH creates a vortex around her as she passes

through the throng, occasionally honouring somebody with

a couple of words, until she arrives thankfully at the

best chair...where she establishes a headquarters. Her

current LORD IN WAITING ferries the lucky few forward to

a brief audience with the QUEEN, each giving way to the

next. VIOLA and WESSEX are, respectively, dipping and

bowing as they are greeted by people who know them...Will,

in close attendance, joins in gratuitously, bowing until

VIOLA nudges him and reminds him to curtsey instead. The

QUEEN'S LORD IN WAITING plucks WESSEX'S sleeve.

The LORD IN WAITING ushers VIOLA through the crowd. WILL

starts to follow. WESSEX takes him by the arm.

ANGLE on the QUEEN.

The LORD IN WAITING has presented VIOLA. VIOLA speaks

from a frozen curtsey.

VIOLA straightens. The QUEEN examines her.

VIOLA remains silent, in apology.

ANGLE on WILL.

He is watching and listening. He has never seen the QUEEN

so close. He is fascinated.

She looks over VIOLA'S shoulder and VIOLA realises WESSEX

has moved up behind her. WESSEX bows.

The COURTIERS titter at her pleasantry.

She has forgotten herself. The COURTIERS gasp. The QUEEN

considers her. WESSEX looks furious. WILL is touched.

Titters again. WESSEX could kill somebody.

Shock and horror. QUEEN ELIZABETH is the only person

amused.

The QUEEN passes by, and as WESSEX comes vertical again,

we see his face a mask of furious realisation.

INT. BURBAGE'S HOUSE. ENTRANCE. DAY.

CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE shuts the door behind him. Above him,

the ceiling creaks to the rhythm of copulation. He has a

sheaf of manuscript pages in his hand. He goes to the

stairs.

The creaking stops.

INT. BURBAGE'S HOUSE. STAIRS. DAY.

MARLOWE ascends.

INT. BURBAGE'S HOUSE. BEDROOM. DAY.

MARLOWE enters, ignoring the situation on the bed where

ROSALINE is astride BURBAGE.

BURBAGE rouses himself violently, throwing ROSALINE off

the bed. The glass bracelet is flung from her wrist. It

breaks on the floor, releasing a strip of paper. BURBAGE

picks it up. What he reads on it does not please him: it

is WILL'S signature.

EXT. STREETS. DAY.

BURBAGE and a solid wedge of the CHAMBERLAIN'S MEND are

cleaving a path through the crowds. Their faces are grim.

INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM/UNDER THE STAGE.

DAY.

We are in Act III Scene I. NED ALLEYN as "MERCUTIO" and

NOL as "BENVOLIO", and two "MONTAGUE" sidekicks are in

occupation of the stage, when the "CAPULETS" swagger in,

four of them headed by JAMES HEMMINGS as "TYBALT."

NED comes out of character.

But suddenly six more men and a dog invade the stage,

ready to fight. BURBAGE and the CHAMBERLAIN'S MEN have

arrived to avenge BURBAGE'S honour with swords, clubs,

and a bucket (containing pig swill).

WILL has already leapt up onto the stage.

BURBAGE aims a blow at WILL, who ducks and grabs a stave

from the nearest actor, and parries the blow.

He swings at BURBAGE, a CHAMBERLAIN'S MAN swings at WILL,

THOMAS cries out, someone else slashes the stage hangings

bringing down the drapes, and in a moment the ADMIRAL'S

MEN and the CHAMBERLAIN'S MEN, using their much rehearsed

skills, are brawling with weapons and fist, using

everything short of unbuttoned rapiers. CRAB, the dog, is

yapping and snapping at any legs he can reach. HENSLOWE,

a little slow to catch up on the situation, checks the

page in his hand. FENNYMAN, much slower to catch up,

watches enthralled.

But now HENSLOWE has worked out that these actors don't

belong, nor does the scene. he enters the fray, but his

interest is protecting his property. Big burly RALPH is

using a couple of unlit torches as weapons; he breaks one

of them over an enemy's back and HENSLOWE turns on RALPH

VIOLA is doing well enough, tripping up an enemy with a

well-judged stave, and then using it to deflect a blow

aimed at WILL

Then he is smashed over the head. He falls off the stage

taking VIOLA with him. Under the stage is a space (known

as Hell) and WILL shoves VIOLA into this space.

He gets back onto the stage, where the goings on are

worthy of the Four Musketeers and Robin Hood combined,

with SAM GOSSE, dressed as "JULIET," fighting with the

best of them. There is a stack of cushions, stored for

the expensive seats, and as the stack s knocked over, NED

ALLEYN and others grab cushions to use as shields. Soon

cushions are being ripped, and the air is full of flying

feathers. The trap door in the stage opens, VIOLA'S head

pops up. She looks around and, surrounded by milling legs

and floating feathers, a boot catches her sideways and

half knocks her wig off. In danger of having her cover

blown, she ducks down again, leaving the trap open just

nicely for Will to plummet down it.

INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. UNDER THE STAGE. DAY.

They embrace and kiss. In a moment they are in a world of

their own.

INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. UNDER THE STAGE. DAY.

The battle rages. FENNYMAN, alone now in the auditorium,

continues to watch entranced. It's the greatest show he's

ever seen. HENSLOWE is desperately trying to rescue odd

props that have been seconded to the fight. Someone picks

up a tree that is to be used in Romeo. HENSLOWE yells.

FENNYMAN notices this, and it rings a distant bell. He

looks around the realises that some of these faces are

unfamiliar. The tree comes crashing down on RALPH'S head.

FENNYMAN looks at HENSLOWE.

He collapses on to a broken bench. FENNYMAN comes over to

him, grabs the script pages from his pocket, and consults

them to confirm what he has now begun to suspect: that

this scene is not in them.

LAMBERT has been sleeping peacefully through this, but

wakes to his master's call.

HENSLOWE attempts to intervene.

And he delivers a telling blow to a passing CHAMBERLAIN'S

MAN, who wheels off the stage. LAMBERT meanwhile is

making short work of the rest of the opposition,

receiving help with the thorny business of identification

from SAM. Stray members of the CHAMBERLAIN'S MEN are

running from the theatre, as BURBAGE, fighting a heroic

last stand, is tipped backwards by FENNYMAN off the stage

and into a bucket of swill. A PAUSE. Then NED starts

applauding. The others, weary from fighting, start

applauding too, from all levels of the theatre. FENNYMAN

looks around, starting to beam, as a din of encores and

bravos engulf him. A star!

INT. BROTHEL. NIGHT.

The victorious army of actors bursts into the brothel,

FENNYMAN at their head. He owns the brothel. The place is

already crowded with WHORES and CUSTOMERS. It's a party.

WILL sits her down in THE COMPANY and takes the chair

next to her A PRETTY WHORE immediately sits on WILL'S

knee and kisses him.

VIOLA furiously pulls the PRETTY WHORE off WILL'S lap.

Glasses are shoved into their hands. Everyone has a

glass. Except RALPH

The PRETTY WHORE has turned her attention to SAM. SAM

looks uncomfortable

FENNYMAN shouts a toast.

Everybody drinks. VIOLA drinks too. She decides too. She

decides to enjoy it. She bangs down her glass.

WILL toasts with her. He sees that she feels one of THE

COMPANY.

EXT. STREET. NIGHT.

A figure is running desperately through the streets. He

comes into the square and runs towards the Rose.

EXT. BROTHEL. NIGHT.

Half THE COMPANY are singing. NOL and a WHORE are

tumbling down the stairs together. He is without his

trousers. An awful lot of drink has gone down.

VIOLA, bright eyed, is banging her glass on the table in

time to a song which is being drunkenly delivered by a

barbershop quartet of actors.

FENNYMAN reels into VIOLA.

In his general enthusiasm, he embraces the next man, who

is RALPH, stone cold sober.

FENNYMAN, beside himself, shouts for silence, announcing

That goes down every well with the entire COMPANY...except

for VIOLA and WILL. He looks at her, helplessly, then

makes as if to say something. VIOLA ducks away from him

and blunders blindly out of the street door, in tears.

VIOLA passes PETER who is coming in from the street.

WILL, attempting to follow VIOLA, is grabbed round the

shoulders by PETER...who, we now see, is in a highly

emotional state. WILL tries to fight him off but PETER

has the strength of the news he brings.

He brings the room to silence.

There are general gasps and cries for information.

No one is more affected than WILL. This second blow is

worse than the first. He stands horror-stricken.

EXT. BROTHEL. NIGHT.

WILL comes staggering out into the street.

He falls into a stagnant puddle, a deep gutter of water

and garbage. He gets up and staggers on.

EXT. CHURCH TOWER. NIGHT.

A church tower looms up in the night sky.

INT. CHURCH. NIGHT.

This is where WILL has come. The church is empty, but for

the demented, grieving figure of SHAKESPEARE, kneeling,

praying, weeping, banging his head, in his private

purgatory, dimly lit by tallow candles, gazed upon by

effigies of the dead and images of his Redeemer. He is

wet, bedraggled, weeds and leaves in his hair.

EXT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. DAY.

A lovely sunny morning. The church bells are ringing.

VIOLA and the NURSE, mounted, approach. VIOLA rides

sidesaddle on a beautiful horse, and is followed, rather

like Quixote by Sancho, by the NURSE on a less impressive

animal.

Riding in the opposite direction, is WESSEX. And what a

happy day it is. He sings and hums to himself merrily.

Here is a man who has heard wonderful news. He sees VIOLA

and greets her merrily.

VIOLA almost faints. The NURSE steadies her.

VIOLA gives a silent cry. The NURSE is speaking to her in

distress.

INT. CHURCH. DAY.

The NURSE is holding VIOLA up as they enter the church.

VIOLA seems catatonic. The NURSE lowers her onto a seat

and sits down next to her.

As they sit, the CHOIR enters singing. WESSEX, who is

sitting in the next pew, looks about him with interest.

He hasn't been in a church for years. What he sees turns

him to jelly. He sees WILL SHAKESPEARE.

ANGLE on WILL.

WILL is a spectral, bedraggled figure, backlit by a great

shaft of light, he would look like a ghost at the best of

times, and this is the worst. Bleeding from where he has

banged his head, bedraggled and ravaged by the night, he

stands in a side chapel staring at WESSEX.

WESSEX gasps and sweats, and sees WILL raise a quivering

accusatory finger at him. WESSEX cracks. He starts to

mumble.

Now VIOLA sees WILL. She is still paralysed, and seems at

first unable to take him in. She watches with detachment

as WESSEX starts to back out of the church, finally

running in terror.

The CHOIR continues to sing, but the scream brings VIOLA

to her senses and she runs to a side door where WILL is

leaving.

EXT. CHURCH. DAY.

Outside, VIOLA sees WILL, staggering away from the

church. She calls his name.

He does not answer. She runs after him.

She claps him to her. They told each other for a moment

then WILL pulls back.

EXT. MEADOW. DAY.

VIOLA'S horse grazes. WILL lies on his back, still

sobered and full of guilt. VIOLA sits on the grass among

the buttercups and looks down at him.

VIOLA is plaiting a finger-ring from stems of grass. She

has not yet revealed her feelings.

WILL turns to look at her.

They kiss again, passionately.

And as their desperate kisses turn into lovemaking we cut

to:

INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY.

He is on the stage of the Rose. The entire COMPANY is

assembled, HENSLOWE and FENNYMAN included, holding pages

of manuscript, which they are sharing together, examining

the separated pages, passing pages to each other, etc.

WILL'S mood is intense and focused.

THE COMPANY murmurs approval.

HENSLOWE is fascinated and appalled.

PAUSE.

WILL is staring at VIOLA

WILL is still staring at VIOLA. Aware, suddenly, of the

others watching, she breaks his gaze and drops her head.

WILL looks at NED.

INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. EVENING.

WILL and VIOLA. VIOLA dressed as THOMAS. He has present

for her--a neatly written manuscript of his play, on

sheets folded to octavo size.

She wants to accept the present with joy, but something

in his mood restrains her.

He turns the pages and shows her.

The words of the scene become WILL'S and VIOLA'S, their

way of saying the farewells they cannot utter.

INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. DAY.

But the scene is continuing with VIOLA dressed as

"THOMAS." Somewhere behind and up above the stage, in a

deserted corner among rigging, bits of scenery, etc.,

they speak the lines and we hardly know ourselves whether

it is rehearsal or lovemaking. But after a few moments it

is definitely lovemaking. Their clothes start coming

away, their words interrupted by kisses.

By now, her loosened bosom-bandage has been pulled away

and WILL passionately embraces her nakedness.

And into this heaving composition comes a little white

mouse, unseen my them, climbing through a knot hole in

the planking behind VIOLA'S head.

An adjacent knot hole reveals a human eye and we do not

need to be told it is JOHN WEBSTER'S.

WEBSTER takes his eye away from the peephole, and frowns,

thinking it out.

EXT. ALLEWAY. DAY.

TILNEY puts a coin in WEBSTER'S hand.

EXT. THE ROSE THEATRE. DAY.

A man is pacing up and down, in a sort of agony. He is

muttering. He is glancing at a sheet of paper. He is

FENNYMAN rehearsing the important role of the Apothecary,

for which he has a special voice.

"Put this in any liquid thing you will And..."--something

He has dried up. He curses--the terror and despair.

He is so wrapped up in all this that he simply does not

notice when WESSEX rides up to the main entrance

dismounts and walks inside.

INT. THE ROSE THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY.

Onstage, the rehearsal continues. WESSEX strides in.

Among the audience are HENSLOWE, a few actors...and JOHN

WEBSTER...who sees WESSEX and jumps up and goes to him.

WESSEX knocks him aside and continues.

Everything stops.

WILL draws his sword.

VIOLA reacts. She almost gives herself away. But the

fight has started.

WESSEX slashes at WILL. WILL knows how to fight. He

parries and thrusts. WESSEX is surprised. The fight goes

fast and furious around the stage, until WILL thrusts

accurately at WESSEX'S chest...and would have killed him

but for the button on his sword-point.

WESSEX grapples with him, and now it becomes a parody of

the Hamlet duel; WESSEX'S unbuttoned sword falls to the

ground, WILL puts his foot on it, tosses WESSEX his own

safe sword, picks up Wessex's sword and continues the

fight until he has WESSEX at his mercy.

WILL has fought with a passionate rage that has everybody

staring at him. Now the look in his eyes is merciless.

NED ALLEYN comes forward looking worried and dubious.

WILL steps back, and sinks to his knees. His relief could

not be greater.

WESSEX gets to his feet. TILNEY enters the auditorium

from the public entrance.

WESSEX storms out past the bewildered TILNEY.

THE COMPANY of actors are dumbstruck. None more than

VIOLA.

TILNEY is unstoppable. He jumps on the stage...and seizes

SAM GOSSE. Before WEBSTER or anyone can intervene, TILNEY

pulls up his skirt, ignoring SAM'S rather gutteral yell

of protest and pulls down SAM'S drawers.

TILNEY'S face is a study. So is everybody else's. WEBSTER

rolls his eyes (oh, these stupid grown-ups!) and deftly

throws one of his mice onto "ROMEO'S" hair. VIOLA gives a

shrill scream, the startled mouse descends her neck via

VIOLA'S ear, and seeks an entry into her collar. By which

time VIOLA has gone berserk and torn off her wig. Her

hair is pinned up but there is no question her gender.

WILL is paralysed. VIOLA gives him a look of terrible

despair and apology.

By now the scene is playing to a crowded theatre, or so

it seems.

SAM has picked himself up, and his drawers.

Everybody looks at WILL, who stares at VIOLA, helpless.

TILNEY turns on his heel and leaves in triumph. THE

COMPANY is still polaxed.

WILL shakes his head. This cannot be the end. VIOLA walks

away, leaving by the public entrance. They all let her

go, watching her silently. As she passes WABASH

As she is leaving, WILL comes to life. He starts off

towards her...but his progress is halted by a sock to the

jaw from NED ALLEYN. WILL falls down in the dust.

FENNYMAN enters, still bent over his sheet of paper,

mumbling his precious lines. When he reaches the

groundlings yard, he finds to his surprise the whole

COMPANY is standing about in attitudes of despair or

worse. FENNYMAN looks around.

EXT. THE ROSE THEATRE. EVENING.

The closure notice is nailed to the door.

INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. NIGHT.

VIOLA, in her nightdress, is reading by candlelight. She

is reading her private manuscript of Romeo and Juliet...and

rereading. Next to her is a tray of covered dishes. the

NURSE enters and looks at her sympathetically. She lifts

the tray. She realises it is heavy. She puts it down and

raises the covers and sees that VIOLA has eaten nothing.

She looks at VIOLA'S tears, but there is nothing to be

said.

INT. TAVERN. DAY.

They are all there--the ADMIRAL'S MEN, including WILL and

HENSLOWE, drowning their sorrows. Everyone is drunk.

FENNYMAN is also there, taking the disaster somewhat

selfishly.

He hands a flask to RALPH who is in a similar mood.

RALPH contemplates the flask, and, since he's not

working, takes a swig. A moment later, he keels over,

rigid as a pole. The street door crashes open. BURBAGE

enters. Behind him enter a solid wedge of the

CHAMBERLAIN'S MEN, sober-faced, several with black eyes

and bandages round their heads.

LAMBERT, FENNYMAN'S henchman and killer, puts down his

tankard and comes forward, casually kicking chairs and

tables out of his way.

LAMBERT reaches up to the wall over the bar and takes

down once of the ceremonial weapons hanging there--a

battle-axe.

But BURBAGE has flintlock pistol stuck into his sash.

BURBAGE draws and the pistol roars, shooting flame,

LAMBERT curses, drops the axe, nurses his wounded hand.

BURBAGE puts the pistol back into his sash. NED ALLEYN is

half-drunk at a table. He staggers to his feet. He faces

BURBAGE.

EXT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. DAY.

A strong wind is blowing through the trees. A BOY with a

paste-pot and a bundle of flyers, is having trouble

pasting a flyer on the wall of the building. A gust of

wind scatters the bundle and sends a couple of dozen

flyers flying into the sky. The BOY with the paste-pot

runs around, trying to recover those he can. We look at

the poster. It says

WILL comes out of the theatre, and passes the poster. He

walks on without looking at it. A voice calls after him:

WILL does not turn to look at him.

WILL carries on walking.

EXT. STREETS. DAY.

WILL is pushing through the crowds on his way to the

river.

INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. VIOLA'S BEDROOM. DAY.

The NURSE is helping VIOLA to dress--in a wedding dress.

The NURSE is in tears. VIOLA submits to the task

impassively.

EXT. THE RIVER. DAY.

WILL is climbing down the ladder to the waiting boats.

INT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. HALL. DAY.

WESSEX, dressed to be a bridegroom is concluding his

negotiations with DE LESSEPS, while LADY DE LESSEPS

weeps. DE LESSEPS is signing papers. There is a money

chest, too.

DE LESSEPS sighs and unlocks his money chest. WESSEX

places his empty purse on the desk.

VIOLA has appeared at the top of the stairs with the

NURSE.

EXT. DE LESSEPSES' HOUSE. DAY.

WILL is running across the grass towards the house. As he

crosses the bridge over the moat, a carriage bears down

on him, and he has to flatten himself against the wall of

the gatehouse as the carriage passes, taking WESSEX and

his bride to church. WILL'S face, as he watches the

carriage disappear. Distant bells begin to peal

EXT. CHURCH DOOR. DAY.

The bells announce the completion of the marriage--as

WESSEX and the new LADY WESSEX leave the church. VIOLA'S

veil is flying in the wind, and beneath it we can just

see VIOLA'S unhappy face. The DE LESSEPS FAMILY entourage

is applauding. WESSEX beams with satisfaction.

Suddenly the sky and the wind deliver a message--a flyer

from the Curtain slaps against WESSEX'S face. He claws at

it and tries to throw it away. The wind delivers it to

VIOLA'S bosom. She takes it up and reads it. And passes

it to the NURSE.

WESSEX descends the steps to where the curtained carriage

awaits the bride and groom. He gallantly holds the door

for VIOLA to enter. She climbs aboard. WESSEX makes to

follow her.

The NURSE grasps him in a moving embrace, to WESSEX'S

discomfort.

He tries to disengage. She won't have it.

After a couple of further attempts, WESSEX extricates

himself.

WESSEX pulls aside the curtain and gets in.

INT. CARRIAGE. DAY.

It takes a moment for WESSEX to realise he is alone in

there. He looks around but VIOLA has fled.

EXT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. DAY.

Hundreds of people are converging on the theatre. Among

them is the Puritan MAKEPEACE, vainly exhorting the

crowds to run away from sin

But MAKEPEACE is being carried inexorably through the

main doors of the theatre.

INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. DAY.

The ADMIRAL'S MEN are all in costume, and are in a buzz

of nervous excitement. ALLEYN, dressed for "MERCUTIO," is

giving last minute instructions to PETER. JAMES and JOHN

HEMMINGS are arguing about the timing of their entrance.

FENNYMAN in his apothecary's cap is agonising over his

lines. WABASH is stuttering over his. Alone in his

dejection in the midst of all this, is WILL, dressed for

WILL nods, miserable. SAM has found a private corner. He

is gargling into a basin. He looks worried and furtive.

INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. AUDITORIUM. DAY.

The audience is gathering.

EXT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. DAY.

Word has got around. Even rich people are coming. They

arrive by carriage and by palanquin.

Some of them are cloaked and hooded, slumming incognito.

A cannon booms from the Curtain. The flag of the

ADMIRAL'S MEN flutters above.

EXT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. ENTRANCE. DAY.

LAMBERT and FREES are taking the entrance money.

INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. AUDITORIUM. DAY.

The auditorium is now packed. Among them, sheepish, is

MAKEPEACE.

INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. DAY.

Everything is ready. NED signals the musicians. Trumpets

and drums sound. The house falls silent.

INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. THE WINGS. DAY.

WABASH seems to be important at the beginning. We have

never been told what part he plays. He is still muttering

lines and stuttering them.

WILL listens to him in agony. He finds HENSLOWE next to

him.

And off we go. HENSLOWE claps WABASH on the shoulder and

sends him through the curtain.

ANGLE on WABASH

INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

The audience waits expectantly. WABASH gathers himself.

INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. DAY.

WILL shuts his eyes and prays.

INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY.

WABASH launches himself into a perfect audacious delivery

like a star.

EXT. STREET. DAY.

VIOLA and the NURSE, hurrying toward the Curtain.

INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. DAY.

HEMMINGS BROTHERS are ready to go on as "SAMPSON" and

"GROCERY," Act I Scene I. They shake hands. Beyond the

curtain, the audience applauds the Prologue as WABASH

comes through the curtain backstage.

The HEMMINGS BROTHERS enter the arena and the play

begins.

POV: from THE WINGS:

HENSLOWE has been overhearing.

And he makes his way towards the front of the house.

EXT. STREET. DAY.

A furious WESSEX is hurrying along the road to the

theatre.

INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. AUDITORIUM/STAGE. DAY.

VIOLA and the NURSE are arriving, and looking for a seat

in the gallery. BURBAGE and his MEN are standing at the

back, behind the people seated in the gallery. The first

scene of the play is continuing

BURBAGE finds HENSLOWE plucking agitatedly at his sleeve.

They are standing behind the back row of the gallery

seats. The spectator in front of them is the NURSE. She

turns round and shushes HENSLOWE up.

Their whispers are causing black looks and hushing noises

from the neighbours. HENSLOWE pulls VIOLA from her seat,

luckily an aisle seat.

HENSLOWE and BURBAGE look at each other. CUT TO:

INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. THE WINGS/STAGE. DAY.

SAM who gathers himself, to make his entrance, quietly

and horribly practising "How now, who calls?"

The author and star, WILL SHAKESPEARE, has his back to

the stage, his hands over his ears. He is cowering in

dread anticipation.

As SAM is about to enter HENSLOWE'S hand yanks him by the

collar, and VIOLA overtakes him and steps on stage. Enter

"JULIET." VIOLA is not wearing the been hidden from us by

her cloak.

INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. AUDITORIUM. DAY.

There is a collective gasp. Nobody has ever seen a BOY

PLAYER like this.

INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. THE WINGS. DAY.

WILL takes his hands from his ears, and turns round in

amazement at the sound of VIOLA'S voice.

INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. AUDITORIUM/STAGE. DAY.

WESSEX has just arrived in the auditorium and jumps as if

he has been shot. He seems about to intervene, but

looking around at the rapt faces he realises he cannot.

INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. THE WINGS. DAY.

HENSLOWE and BURBAGE look at each other.

INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. DAY.

FENNYMAN, oblivious to the drama, is practising his lines

in a fever of nervousness.

INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

Swordplay. An amazing performance that holds the audience

spellbound. "TYBALT" kills "MERCUTIO."

A roll of thunder. Over the heads of the audience, far

above the thatched roof of the theatre, clouds are

gathering in the sky. On stage "MERCUTIO" is in 'ROMEO'S"

arms, but the tone of the playing is unlike anything we

have seen before: without bombast, intense and real. And

the audience is quiet and attentive.

EXT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. DAY.

In the semirural view towards the City of London, there

can be discerned a gaggle of approaching MEN and three is

something orderly about them. As they come closer, we see

that they are a company of PIKE MEN, marching toward the

theatre, led by the Master of the Revels, TILNEY. Thunder

rolls.

INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

Figures are running across the stage, in the panic that

follows "TYBALT" death.

INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. DAY.

WILL has just 'killed' "TYBALT." He is still breathless

from fighting. he stands face to face with VIOLA.

They stare at each other, transfixed.

PAUSE. She cannot answer.

INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

We cannot tell whether this is the play or their life.

The audience, and the rest of the world, might as well

not exist. WILL turn from her and begins to descend from

the 'balcony.'

WILL stops.

WILL as "ROMEO" seems unable to speak. Then he says:

All other sounds drain away, and time seems to stop.

INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

Now the FRIAR is giving "JULIET' his potion.

INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

It's FENNYMAN'S moment. The "APOTHECARY" and "ROMEO."

FENNYMAN has cut in several lines early, but his

conviction is astonishing.

EXT. STREET. NEAR THE CURTAIN THEATRE. DAY.

TILNEY, on the march. His hand grips a copy of the

Curtain flyer.

INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

"JULIET" lies "dead." She lies on top of her tomb, "lying

in stage," her best dress, her hair done, her hands in

prayer at her breast, her eyes closed. "ROMEO" has found

her like this.

As WILL embraces her, VIOLA'S eyes flicker open (shielded

by WILL from the audience) and the lovers look at each

other for a moment as WILL and VIOLA rather than as

"ROMEO" and "JULIET." Their eyes are wet with tears.

INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. AUDITORIUM. DAY.

BURBAGE and ROSALINE are watching.

INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. AUDITORIUM. DAY.

KEMPE is watching.

INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. AUDITORIUM. DAY.

We see that in the audience are several of the WHORES we

recognise from the brothel. They are weeping openly.

INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

WILL is raising the fatal drug in a last toast.

INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. THE WINGS. DAY.

FENNYMAN, moved but proud in the wings.

INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. AUDITORIUM. DAY.

The NURSE is weeping too.

INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

"JULIET" wakes up with a start.

I do remember well where I should be, And there I am.

Where is my Romeo?"

INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. AUDITORIUM. DAY.

INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

"JULIET" takes "ROMEO'S" dagger.

This is thy sheath. There rust, and let me die."

She stabs herself and dies. The "inner curtain" closes

over the tomb.

INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE/AUDITORIUM. DAY.

HIGH ANGLE on audience and stage. "THE PRINCE" played by

WABASH is having the last word.

The end. There is complete silence. The ACTORS are

worried. But then the audience goes mad with applause.

INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. THE INNER CURTAIN/STAGE. DAY.

The inner curtain opens, but WILL and VIOLA, are in a

play of their own...embracing and kissing passionately,

making their own farewell. HENSLOWE is too stunned and

moved to react at first. Then he looks at the audience

and the penny drops. It's a hit.

INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. AUDITORIUM/STAGE. DAY.

The audience roars. WILL, VIOLA, and THE COMPANY come

forward to meet the applause. TILNEY and his MEN burst

in. TILNEY jumps up onto the stage, where the ADMIRAL'S

MEN are taking their bows. TILNEY'S "COPS" ring the

stage, facing inwards.

The AUDIENCE goes quiet. BURBAGE jumps out of the

audience onto the stage.

TILNEY is at a loss but only for a moment.

The entire audience and the actors, recoil and gasp. The

NURSE crosses herself.

He points at VIOLA, brazening it out without much chance.

And an authoritative voice from the audience interrupts

him.

It is QUEEN ELIZABETH herself, descending now, her hood

and cloak thrown back. She is an awesome sight. A shaft

of sunlight hits her.

There is a general parting of the waves, soldiers and

actors, a general backing off and bowing as QUEEN

ELIZABETH takes the limelight.

VIOLA comes forward, and is about to curtsey when she

catches the QUEEN'S eye, an arresting eye, which arrests

the curtsey and turns it into a sweeping bow.

The voice belongs to JOHN WEBSTER. He points firmly at a

figure in the audience, WESSEX, trying to look

inconspicuous.

The QUEEN fixes WILL with a beady eye.

INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. MAIN ENTRANCE. DAY.

The QUEEN is bowed out through the doors.

EXT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. DAY.

A gaggle of the QUEEN'S favoured courtiers wait by her

carriage. WESSEX is hurrying down the exterior staircase

as the QUEEN emerges from the theatre. During the

following a general egress from the Auditorium is taking

place, including some of the actors crowding to see her

off. WESSEX bows out of breath.

VIOLA has come out of the theatre, amongst some of the

other players. The QUEEN catches her eye.

The QUEEN proceeds towards her carriage. There is an

enormous puddle between her and her carriage. The QUEEN

hesitates for a fraction and then marches through the

puddle as cloaks descend upon it.

She splashes her way into her carriage, which departs.

INT. THE CURTAIN THEATRE. STAGE. DAY.

VIOLA nods, heartbroken too. For a long moment they

cannot say anything to each other. The she holds up

Wessex's purse.

WILL looks at her.

Pause. They look at each other. Suddenly the conversation

seems to be about them.

WILL half smiles. Then he's serious. They look deeply at

each other...and rush into each other's arm.

She kisses him with finality. Then turns and runs from

him. WILL watches as she goes.

INT. WILL'S ROOM. DAY.

A blank page. A hand is writing: TWELFTH NIGHT. We see

WILL sitting at his table.

EXT. UNDERWATER. DAY.

Two figures plunge into the water

INT. WILL'S ROOM. DAY.

WILL at his table writing

EXT. UNDERWATER. DAY.

VIOLA in the water

EXT. BEACH. DAY.

VIOLA is walking up a vast and empty beach ....

INT. WILL'S ROOM. DAY.

WILL looks up from the table.

He looks down at the paper, and writes: "Viola" Then:

"What country friends is this?"

EXT. BEACH. DAY.

DISSOLVE slowly to VIOLA, walking away up the beach

towards her brave new world.
