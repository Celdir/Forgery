FADE IN: (BEFORE TITLES)

EXT. NEW YORK CITY - BLOOMINGDALE'S - DAY

The busy block between 59th and 60th-Streets in the

middle of a weekday afternoon. Buses, taxis, trucks;

shoppers, messengers, teenagers. In one corner of the

screen the time is SUPERIMPOSED:

Now a man (GREEN) is ZOOMED IN on -- little of his actual

face is visible because of his thick white hair, large

bushy white mustache, dark glasses and slouch hat. The

rest of him is encased in a knee-length raincoat. He

wears gloves and is carrying a large, brown-paper-covered

package by a wooden handle attached to the twine securing

"Everest Printing Corp., 826. Lafayette St." -- and appears

quite heavy. But Green has the gait of a man. younger than

he appears. As he turns and heads down a flight of stairs,

CAMERA ZOOMS IN even more to the single word on a sign:

"SUBWAY."

INT. SUBWAY - 59TH ST. CHANGE BOOTH - DAY

A level above the locals, two above the express trains.

Green appears and joins the line waiting to buy tokens.

Wordlessly he shoves two coins under the grille, receives

his token, moves on, drops it into the slot, pushes

through the turnstile and heads for one of the descending

stairways. CAMERA HOLDS on a sign identifying his choice:

"IRT. LEX. AVE. LOCAL. DOWNTOWN.."

INT. SUBWAY PLATFORM - 59TH ST. DOWNTOWN LOCAL - DAY

Green comes off the stairs and arrives on a line with a

placard that hangs over the edge of the platform bearing

the number "10", black on a white ground, indicating the

point where the front of a ten-car train stops. Now the

sound of a distant rumbling, growing louder, makes Green

turn,.cross to the platform's edge, lean out over the

track and peer into the darkness of the tunnel beyond the

far end of the platform.

SUBWAY TUNNEL - GREEN'S POV

as the four lights -- amber and white markers over white

sealed-beam headlights -- come into view and the train

roars and clatters into the station. CAMERA PANS with

the head car as it stops, its breaks sighing, and a pair

of doors in EXTREME FOREGROUND, rattles open. CAMERA now

MOVES forward, into the car, then TURNS and through the

still-open door, focuses on the T.A. Cop, still standing

on the platform, regarding Green (CAMERA).

MED. SHOT - FIFTH CAR

as he leans out of his window surveying the station. He

has a young, boyish face surrounded by long, curly red

hair.

INT. FIFTH CAR

The door to the conductor's cab is open as Bud continues to

lean out the window. Directly, behind him is MATSON, an

older Conductor of retirement age who is busy instructing

the younger man.

C'mon, kid -- out loud so's I can

hear what you're doin'.

I'm checking the passengers getting

on and off -- front and back --

okay, it's all clear -- I'm shut-

ting the doors; -.rear section

(pushes a button)

-- then the front section --

-- and -- the doors are closed.

He pulls his head in and checks a row of lights on a panel.

Now I 'm checking the indicator box

to make sure that the doors are

all locked -- okay.

The train starts with a jerk.

Igo back out the window --

-- for a distance of three car-

lengths to see that nobody's

being dragged --

-- I remove my door key -- and

then the skate key -- and then

I hit the transmitter button.

(into a mike)

Fifty-first Street' next stop --

the next stop is Fifty-first Street.

(turning to Matson)

How'd I do?

3.

How come you wanna be a conductor,

anyway? Don't you know the con-

ductor's sittin' in the goddam

hotseat?

What do you mean, Mr. Matson?

You're visible, for God's sake!

Anything goes wrong -- anyone's

got a gripe -- you're the one they

see. Hell, in my twen'y-nine years

o' stickin' my head out there I

been slugged, spit on, hit by

purses, fruit, rolled-up newspapers,

baseball mitts -- an'.I been god-

dam lucky! I never been puked on

by a drunk like Charlie Boltzen was

on the Parkchester line -- or

stabbed in the neck like I heard

one fella was on the Astoria BMT --

Jesus.

You take my advice, kid -- serve

your six months an' then put in

for Motorman. Watch it, we're

cumin' in.

Bud looks quickly off, sees the approaching station and

hits his transmitter button.

No it ain't

Fifty-first Street, sorry

the station is Fifty-first Street.

Never say you're sorry, kid --

somebody'll come back here an'

bust your goddam nose.

I waiting for the last car) and gradually slow until we

stop -- and we are looking right into the face of a man

(GREY) whose frame and features, while entirely different

from Green's, are covered by the same identical externals

-- thick white hair, bushy white mustache, dark glasses,

slouch hat, gloves and raincoat. He looks at the conduc-

tor (CAMERA) for an instant, then darts away.

PLATFORM - GREY

RIDERS entering and exiting the train as Grey heads down-

track. He carries a large tan valise trimmed in dark

brown.

INT. FOURTH CAR

Grey just makes it to the car as the doors close, holding

them back until he's squeezed through. The train starts

with a lurch as he heads for the rear of the car and takes

up a position, leaning his back against the storm door and

placing his valise on the floor, between his feet. He

surveys the car with cold, heavy-lidded eyes.

INT. FIRST CAR

Green has a seat opposite the shut steel door of the

motorman's cab. His package is on the floor, between

his knees, his arms resting on its top. TWO BOYS, ten

and twelve, brothers, are at the window of the front storm

door, their eyes glued to the track and tunnel before

them, playing.: at driving the train.

INT. FIFTH CAR - CONDUCTOR'S CAB

Bud is removing his key and activating his mike.

Grand Central Station, next stop

-- the next stop is Grand Central.

Yeah -- if I was you I'd start

studyin' for that motorman's exam

right now.

5.

To tell you the.;truth, Mr. Matson,

I have been. Want to hear some-

thing?

Every car on the IRT is seventy-two

75,000 pounds. It holds 44 seats

with room for 136 standing.

'Cept at rush hour when you can

push in another 20, at least.

Honest to God, I. know personally

of a case where this guy on a number

5 train dies of a heart attack at

Union Square and he has t' wait

until the Grand Concourse in the

Bronx before enough people get off

so's he can fall down.

Honest to God.

Mr. D'Agostino who rode with me

last week said that happened on a

double -A train on the West Side.

Yeah? Who y' gonna believe? A

wop or an American?

Here's where I'm gettin' off --

think you can get to Brooklyn

Bridge all by yourself?

Long as I don't have 'to drive --

Stick with it, kid -- you're doin'

great. See ya t'morrow.

He crosses to the nearest door as the train decelerates.

Bud activates. his mike and announces, waving to Matson

as he does.

Grand Central Station -- change

for the express. This is Grand

Central.

The train stops, the doors open and Matson steps out,

colliding with a very large man (BROW^?PN) who is in a hurry

to get aboard. His face is adorned with a large, white,

bushy mustache, dark glasses, a lot of white hair, a slouch

hat and, covering the rest of him, a raincoat. He carries

an outsized florist's box, big enough for several dozen-

long-stemmed roses, under his. arm, and wears gloves.

What's your hurry, chief? We

won't leave without you.

Brown says nothing to Matson, does not look at him, does

not even seem aware of their cohtact. Matson goes off

into the crowd on the platform and Brown heads for the

front of the car.

INT. FIRST CAR - GREEN

Still sitting, still facing the motorman's cab. The two

boys continue to play at the front window. The doors can

be heard slamming shut and the train jerks into motion.

Thirty-third Street -- next stop

is Thirty-third Street .

Suddenly Green's hand,clutches at his shirt collar, unbut-

toning the top button and loosening his tie. He breathes

a sigh of relief, ' then notices that his left leg is vibrat-

ing. He quickly stills it by placing a hand on his knee.

INT. FOURTH CAR - GREY

Leaning back against the storm door. Now he picks up his

valise, turns and.looks through the door, across the

platform between the cars, into the fifth car, and catches

sight of Brown who nods, almost imperceptively.

Grey makes no sign of recognition at all. He turns and

starts forward through the car, heading for the third car.

At the far end a MAN is standing in front of the door,

leaning down to talk to a seated GIRL. Grey stops and

waits a moment. Finally:

Your ass.

The man looks around and surveys Grey.

7.

What about it?

Move it.

The man glances at Grey for a moment, then moves it.

Grey opens the door and steps out onto the platform

between the two cars.

The tile mosaics spelling out "28TH STREET." CAMERA now

DOLLIES to a TIGHT CLOSE SHOT of still another man with a

white bushy mustache, white hair, dark glasses, slouch hat,

gloves and raincoat -- BLUE. The time is SUPERIMPOSED:

"2a 01. "

Blue stands at the downtown end of the platform, near the

number 10 placard, carrying a bulging canvas valpac in

one hazed and a trombone case in the other. A rumbling

sound is heard, building, until a train roars through on

the northbound express track, its lights flashing between

the pillars. In a moment it is gone and the sound dies.

Now a young black,.dressed in the latest extravagant

PIMP's fashions -- flaring double-knit trousers, three-

inch heels, wide-lapeled jacket and white, extra-wide-

brimmed hat, swaggers, loose-jointed, to a spot near Blue

and waits, cool and relaxed. He becomes aware of Blue

observing him.

What's wrong, dude -- ain't you

.never seen a sunset.before?

Blue-smiles softly and looks uptrack.

ZOOMS IN on a sign on the side of the first car: "PELHAM

BAY PARK" until only "PELHAM" fills the SCREEN.

MED. SHOT - BLUE

He hangs back until everyone has gotten on or off the

train, then, without haste, carrying the valpac in one

hand and the trombone in the other, he approaches the

front of the first car. The Motorman (DENNY DOYLE), a

middle-aged man with a ruddy face and wearing pin-striped

overalls, is leaning far gut of his window, looking back

along the platform. Blue puts down his bags, puts his

right hand into his raincoat pocket and leans against the

train with his left shoulder, blocking Doyle's view of

the rest of the train.

Hey -- how do you expect me to -- ?

He stops, suddenly aware that Blue has removed a very

large army automatic from his raincoat pocket and has

placed the muzzle against his (Doyle's) head. Doyle

jerks his head back, suddenly, banging it hard against

the windowframe. Blue crooks his hand inside the window

and now places the gun against the Motorman's cheek,

directly under his right eye.

For God's sake --.what do you want?

I'm taking your train.

Get rid of your seat.

Doyle springs to his feet and swats up the folding seat

with a clatter.

Yes, sir!

Just take it easy. Now move

over to the window -- and if you

try to touch the mike pedal with

your foot I'll shoot it off.

12.

A sharp rapping at the door and Green opens it. Blue

squeezes in, placing his bags atop Green's package. it

is becoming very crowded in the cab as Blue again pockets

his gun.

All right, Mr. Green?

A hundred percent.

Then get it started.

Green moves over to face the controls. He stares down at

them for a moment, then reaches with his left hand to the

controller, his right to the brake handle. Pressing down

firmly on the controller, he nudges it to the left.

You say when, Mr. Blue.

Keep going --

You're still in switching. Why

don't you peg it up to series?

You're green all the way through.

We're in no hurry.

Suddenly there's a popping sound and the power fails for

a moment.

What happened?

She must've bucked.

You said you could drive this thing.

It wasn't mel

It's the train -- she bucks all

the time -- especially in switching.

She's a dog.

Green glances quickly at Doyle and grins.

What's your name, motorman?

Denny Doyle, sir.

You ever been written up?

Yes, sir -- once.

14.

What for?

Running a red signal. The trippers

stopped us cold and I hadda climb

down and reset 'em by hand but by

that time Control knew I was lying

dead. I never got written up since.

How about you?

Twice. -- once on the Canarsie --

That's right, Mr. Green -- tell him

all about yourself.

Green stops and looks at Blue.

There's the emergency power box.

Green knocks off his controller and eases the brake handle

to the right.

INT. TUNNEZ

as the train slows and screeches to a stop.

INT. MOTORMAN'S CAB

Yeah -- I'm taking the brake handle

and the reverse key, Denny -- and

I want your cutting key, too.

He pulls the reverse key out of its receptacle and holds

out his hand.

Doyle fishes into his overalls, pulls out the large key

and gives it to Green who puts the brake handle and the two

bulky keys into his two raincoat pockets, then squeezes by

Blue and the packages and goes out.

You'll be hearing from Command

Center in a minute )r two but you'll

front of it, glides to one side and opens the door for him.

Thanks, Mr. Grey.

Don't mention it, Mr. Green.

INT. SECOND CAR

Brown slides open the door for Green, then slides it shut

again. They speak in low tones.

Give me your cab key.

You got three seconds to live,

conductor -- one -- two --

Bud whips the key from his pocket and hands it to Green,

who unlocks the cab door they're standing next to and

enters, closing the door after him.

What's he going to do?

You wouldn't want me to spoil the

surprise.

INT. SECOND CAR - CAB

as Green seats himself before the panel and begins arming

it. He fits the brake handle into place, then fishes. the

reverse key out of his pocket -- it is five inches long,

with a shiny surface, and a wrench-type handle that fits

into a receptacle on the flat portion of the controller --

and finally inserts the cutting key -- similar to the reverse

key but with a slightly smaller head, and turns it.

INT. TOWER ROOM

A long, unadorned room with a row of desks with phones, and

a door marked "TOILET". Several TOWERMEN (and MRS. JENKINS,

a black Towerwoman) sit at the desks before the flashing

phone consoles, talking to dispatchers, trainmasters and

other Towers. The predominant feature of the room, however,

i is the electronic Model Board, stretched high across one

wall, recording in colored slashes of light the movements

of every train that passes through the sector, all of it

superimposed on a painted map showing the line's track

routes and stations. One of the Towermen, MARINO, rushes

over to Caz as he and the Plumber enter.

Jesus Christ, Caza, you picked a

helluva day to be late --

You wanted a plumber down here,

didn't you? Whose goddam wedding

ring was it?

Who else? Mrs. Jenkins.

MRS. JENKINS

I'm sorry, Mr. Dolowicz -- it just

My hand-wasn't in the john, Mr.

Dolowicz -- it was over the john.

Dunno yet.

Couple-three minutes. Command

reset a tripper -- or a door got

thing more serious and he'd'a

As the. six or seven passengers in the rear section rise

and move forward, the cab door opens and Doyle comes out,

Get going, Mr. Green.

Green nods and goes to the front, uses a key to slide open

the storm door, steps out and closes it again, then jumps

down onto the tracks.

Motorman -- come here.

Yes, sir?

I want you to walk uptrack and

collect all the passengers in

the nine cars we out loose, and

lead them back to the 28th St.

No. No one else can leave.

incandescent bulbs immediately go on, thereby diminishing

the brightness in the car by half. There's a general

stirring among the Passengers as they look around them,

their alarm peaking again.

Please be quiet -- nothing's

going to happen if you do as

you're told. Get going, Motorman.

As Doyle leaves at one end of the train, Green reappears

at the other.

Elevators and the Information Desk. CLIVE PRESCOTT, a

black plainclothes lieutenant in the Transit Police, is

pacing, waiting. The time is SUPERIMPOSED:

"2:09."

A uniformed TRANSIT COP sits behind the desk, watching him.

Finally: an elevator door opens and a smart, efficient

SECRETARY emerges, followed by FOUR JAPANESE in business

suits.

Ah, Lieut. Prescott -- it was nice

of you to leave your duties long

enough to show our distinguished

guests around the facilities. May

I present Mr. Yashimura, Mr. Mat-

sumoto, Mr. Tomashita, and Mr.

The small-framed.Orientals bow in turn.

-- who are all Directors of the

Tokyo Metropolitan Subway System.

Gentlemen, this is Lieut. Clive

Prescott of our own Transit Authority

Police.

A pleasure, gentlemen.

29.

When you're through the Chairman

would like to say goodbye per-

sonally so send them up to

thirteen, will you?

I sure will.

She smiles at the Japanese and walks back to the elevators,

pressing the UP button. Prescott looks at the four men

for a moment, uncertainly, then goes after the Secretary

and speaks to her in low tones.

eak English, don't they?

We're not sure.

You're not.

SECRETARY .

We've been proceeding on the

assumption that they do.

You have.

The elevator door opens and-she steps in, smiling sweetly.

Sayonara.

The door closes. Prescott shrugs, then turns and smiles

at the visitors. They smile back. He takes a deep

breath, then begins.

The New York City Subway System

is the largest'in the world, with

237 miles of track and seven

thousand cars that carry over a

billion and a third passengers

every year, making it also the

busiest railroad in,the world.

I can see that this last fact

surprises you.

The Japanese look anything but surprised. Prescott goes

on, resolutely.

30.

Yes. Well- Grand Central is

the busiest station passenger-wise

-- train-wise, it's West 4th St.

on the I.N.D. line. Now, if you'll

step this way, gentlemen -

They step no way at all. Prescott gestures broadly.

This way --

He hurries ahead of them to open the door and hold it for

them as they finally follow.

We are entering the headquarters

of the Transit Police, occupying

the entire second floor of this

building. We call it the Nerve

Center.

INT. OPERATIONS - DAY

CLOSE SHOT - STATUS BOARD

A huge police map covering one wall, divided into pastel

shadings of yellow, red, orange, blue and green, showing

the various areas of the system. Colored lights -- red an&

yellow -- are continually changing and flickering.

The Status Board pinpoints the

disposition of every Transit

Authority policeman presently in

the field. Things are usually

jumping pretty good in here.

CAMERA begins to ZOOM BACK, revealing the scene: a large

room, cut. up by glass dividers into a maze of squares and

rectangles manned by uniformed T.A. POLICEMEN, sitting at

desks with telephone consoles. The place is absolutely

dead -- some reading, some eating, some sleeping.

We have one of our own T.A. cops

on every station and every train

in the entire system between the

hours of eight P.M. and four A.M.

Since we instituted this watch,

we've out crime in the subways by

about 60%.

31.

CAP4ERA has finished its ZOOM and now PANS to include

Prescott and his four Japanese.

I'm sure you have your own share

of crime on the Tokyo subway, right?

They merely stare at Prescott and smile.

Right.

He.clears his throat, loosens his tie and looks around for

help.

Uh -- follow me, gentlemen,

He starts off through the room, the Japanese following.

These are the assignment desks,

one for each of the three lines --

the I.R.T., the B.M.T. and the

I.N.D. -- and.over here, the Oper-

ations Lieutenant, Sol Garber.

Prescott has stopped beside a desk. GARBER, 40, stocky,

dour, with a dark stubble that requires shaving twice a

day, is absorbed reading the Village Voice.

Uh -- Sol -- I'd like you to meet

some friends of the Chairman.

Garber looks up over his paper for a moment.

Good friends of the Chairman.

Hi ya.

They're -- uh -- directors of the

Tokyo Subway.

32.

CONTINUED.- 2

You don't say.

I do say. I -- uh -- told them

things are usually jumping. like

crazy in here.

Jumping. Right.

Tell them about some of the excit-

ing things that have been happening

lately, Sol --

Yeah, well -- we had a bomb scare

in the Bronx yesterday -- but it

turned out to be a cantaloupe.

He and Prescott look at the Japanese. Nothing.

How about another one, Sol?

Well -- uh -- Thursday there were

three unrelated knife fights in a

single half hour -- two dead and

three wounded --

-- one critical?

The Japanese smile.

I'm busy, Clive, okay?

He goes back to his newspaper as Prescott leads his four

charges away.

In the course of a normal week the

T.A. Police have to deal with such

crimes as robbery, assault, murder,

drunkenness, injury, illness,

vandalism, abusiveness, sexual

molestation and exhibitionism.

You know, flashing?

33.

To illustrate, he waves a bottom corner of his jacket at

the Japanese who nod appreciatively. Then he lifts a

pistol from his shoulder holster, just far enough to show

the handle.

We carry firearms, of course --

off duty as well as on

-- and we're fully empowered to

make arrests.

in fact -- you're all four under

arrest right now. You get me?. I'm

tossing you all in the pokey and

throwing away the key.

He smiles and they smile back. He feels much better.

All right, you creeps, let's go

upstairs to the Command Center.

They start off.

He disappears down the steps.

28TH ST. PLATFORM - TRAVELLING

A train is standing with its doors open, and lit within

only by the emergency bulbs. Caz hurries south along the

platform, heading for the first car, his ample stomach

bouncing over his low-slung belt, CAMERA LEADING him until

he comes to the front of the train and stops to talk to

the MOTORMAN, a grizzled old-timer who needs a shave.

When did the power go?

34.

Who wants to know?

The Supervisor of the Grand Central

Tower wants to know!

Oh -- sure -- it went a 'couple of

minutes ago.

He starts off.

What happened down there -- a man

under?

Who wants to know?

INT. TUNNEL

as Caz comes to the end of the platform, climbs down to

the roadbed and starts through the darkened tunnel. He

breaks into a trot, only to slow to a walk and then stop

as he sees something approaching in the darkness: a

large CROWD of people, being guided by Doyle who uses a

flashlight. Caz scratches his head.

What now, for Chripsake?

It is all right, Lieut. Prescott

-- I'm sure.we can find it by our-

selves.

Thank you for a most instructive

visit, Lieutenant.

And. most exciting, too.

They all bow low and file out. Prescott watches them in a

near state of shock.

- Since this is my last day on the

job, I might as well make it a

good one.

for the mike)

Not here, for Ch'rissake -- Take

sits, then punches in a line on the console and speaks

into the mike.

hear me?

This is Pelham. Identify your-

self, please.

Lieut. Prescott of. the Transit

I'm the man who stole your train.

There's no way you can get away

with it -- you're underground,

better contact the Mayor without

wasting any more time? The moment

you've done it report back to me

Bedlam. The train still stands idly, empty now, its doors

closed. There's a CROWD milling about, some pounding

futilely at the doors of the train, others just standing

around, waiting. ARTIS JAMES, a black T.A. cop is talking

to a small group of irate citizens. He carries a radio on

a strap over his shoulder.

MICRO-CLOSE SHOT - THERMOMETER

Being held between a NURSE's fingers, slowly turning so the

mercury catches the light.

What does it say?

Including the MAYOR, a short, swarthy, roly-poly man with

a fringe of dark hair and modish aviator's glasses;. un-

shaven, lying in bed, the covers. pulled up to his chin;

suffering from the flu; a glass,of juice on his bedside

table along with sprays and vials of pills; and the Nurse,

an elderly, white-haired we nan who, in case of invasion,

could hold off the Mongols single handedly.

103-point-4?! It was-only 102-

point-9 the last time!

Last time it was orally. Orally is

generally a half a degree lower.

Don't remind me. All I know is I've

is ready to come off and my nose is

a disaster area I'm the Mayor of

the goddam city of New York, the

second most important elective

office in the entire United States --

are you telling me that I have

to lie here feeling lousy like every

other zhlub in the country?

(unperturbed, as she goes)

Don't forget to drink your juice

at three. And take two of the

blue pills.

Orally? ,

(but she's gone)

Boy -- boy oh boy --

He picks up the remote-control clicker and raises the sound

of his TV set.

Couple number two, Arthur and

Eleanor -- you have twenty points

-- answer the bonus question

correctly and you'll move into

first place --

The phone rings and he clicks the sound off with one hand

and lifts the receiver with the other.

Yeah.

Hello, Nate, it's Warren -- I'm

coming upstairs.

No!

WARREN ' S VOICE

Sorry, Nate, it can't be helped.

Yes it can -- I'll already be dead

when you get here.

WARREN' S VOICE

Hang on a little longer, will you,

Nate? We've got a real bitch on

our hands.

55.

Don't tell me, I don't want to know.

WARREN ' S VOICE

I'm coming up.

Can't you handle it, Warren?

Sure I can handle it -- like I

handle every other rotten filthy

job in this miserable city --

but I won't:

What do you mean you won't? You're

the goddam Deputy Mayor -- of course

This one you've got to handle your-

self, Nate.

What is it, another strike? That's

all right -- I can take another

A gang of men has hijacked a subway

What?!!

Come on up.

Shit. Shit, piss, fuck.

He clicks the TV back on.

-- And that means couple number

one, Tom and Rusty, are the winners

of today's Newlywed Game!!

I missed it.

56.

He clicks off the TV as WARREN LASALLE enters, a tall, lean,

no-nonsense executive with long, blond hair, sideburns and

a large blond mustache.

I thought it over, Warren -- you

know what we're gonna do?

No, tell me.

Let 'em keep the goddam subway train.

Hell, we've got plenty more just

like it -- we'll never miss it.

How about the seventeen hostages

-- will we miss them?

Oh. Dammit, Warren, the city hasn't

got a million dollars!

Then you'd better empty out one

of your Swiss bank accounts because

there's no other way out.

Don't we even get` to think about

it?

There's no time! In --

(checking the time)

-- exactly forty-nine minutes they're

gonna start shooting those hostages.

How would that look in the Daily

News? -- "1NEW YORKERS DIE WHILE

MAYOR THINKS!"

I still want the full picture.

Get the Police Commissioner, the

Chairman of the Transit Authority,

and that putz we've got for a

They're on their way over now.

57.

But it's no good running to them,

Nate -- you're the Mayor -- which

means You're gonna do it my way

-- just like always.

Shit. Shit, piss, fuck.

Hey, Frank -- you're hogging all

my circuits!

What do you want me to do? I got

motormen calling in from all along

the line trying to find out what

the hell's going on!

Tell 'em to shut up and get off

the air -- I need some more lines

open !

I never thought I'd see the day

when talking to murderers got

priority over running a railroad.

Oh, get off it, Frank -- our priority

is trying to save the lives of those

passengers!

Screw the goddam passengers! What

do they expect for their lousy thirty-

five cents -- to live forever? !

Oh, you're beautiful.

(into the mike)

Do you read me, Pelham One Two Three -- ?

58.

If I were handling it I'd go storming

in there with guns and tear gas and

I blast 'em outl

Yeah, well, you're not handling it

so why don't you start doing your

own work and let the police do theirs.

Like that lily-livered cop who's

on the train? Why hastn't he started

shooting yet?

We don't.even know it is a he --

(into the mike)

Do you read me, Pelham One Two Three -- ?

Goddam woman cops -- what the hell

good are they? She probably can't

find her gun in her goddam purse!

This is Pelham One Two Three --

do you have any news to report?

INTERCUT - PRESCOTT & BLUE

Nothing yet.

What were you' calling about?

We need more time.

It's 2:24, Lieutenant -- you still

have 49 minutes.

Be reasonable, will you? We're

trying to cooperate but you're not

giving us enough time to work with.

49 minutes.

59.

We're dealing with City Hall, for

God's sake -- you know what a mass

of red tape that is!

49 minutes.

Look, I know how to tell time, too,

but we aren't gonna get anywhere if

all you do is repeat 49 minutes!

MED. SHOT - PRESCOTT

Sobered and subdued.

Yeah. All right, we'll get back

as soon as we can.

He disconnects and sits back in his chair, staring at the

ceiling.

Christ -- to hear you pleading with

that chickenshit -- it makes me

ashamed to be an American.

Go away, Frank -- go play with

your trains.

INT. FIRST CAR

as Blue steps out of the cab. Green is staring at the

hostages, nervously.

Everything quiet out here, Mr. Green?

Yeah -- except I think we've got our-

selves a cop.

One of the hostages -- fuzz if I

ever saw it.

Which one?

On the right --

PANNING SHOT - HOSTAGES

On the right side of the car, from face to face.

-- the fourth, fifth, sixth,

seventh -- that's him, next to

the freak --

It's the W.A.S.P. type, who is staring off into space,

I sitting next to the Hippie who seems hypnotized by his own

wiggling toes.

You ever see anybody look more

like a cop?

MED. SHOT - BLUE & GREEN

I'd better frisk him. Cover me.

He walks slowly down the aisle and stops. in front of the

W.A.S .P .

On your feet.

W.A.S.P.

What?

You heard me -- stand up!

Nervously, the man stands. Blue frisks him, quickly and

expertly. When he fails to find a weapon, he takes the

man's wallet.

Okay -- you can sit down.

61.

As the man sits, Blue looks through the wallet.

School teacher.

W.A.S.P.

That's right.

You ever been told you look like a

policeman,?

W.A.S .P .

All the time -- but I can't help

Blue tosses the wallet back into the teacher's lap, then

turns to face the other hostages.

Listen to me, everybody. I'm sure

you've' all figured out what' happening

by now -- you're hostages.

VARIOUS REACTION SHOTS

The Passengers -- some groaning -- some frightened -- the

-- etc.

MED. SHOT - BLUE r

That means when we get what we,want

you'll be released unharmed. Until

And if you don't get what you want?

What'll happen. to us?

We expect to get it..

EXT. EAST RIVER DRIVE - DAY

The Brooklyn Bridge and the myriad ramps leading onto the

heads uptown, its siren wailing.

The time is SUPERIMPOSED: "2:27".

INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY

coming from the radio.

f This is the Police Commissioner --

Turn off that goddam music, will

you, George?

Harry? I'm heading up to see the

Mayor right now. What's it look

like down there?

EXT. PARK AVENUE - 28TH STREET SUBWAY STATION - DAY

The BOROUGH COMMANDER sits on the front seat of a prowl car,

his feet hanging out the open door, talking on the phone.

Around him: SPECTATORS, COPS, activity, noise and confusion.

It's murder, Phil -- as usual,

they're coming out of the woodwork.

I wouldn't be surprised if we got

a couple of thousand thrill-seekers

-- they really smell blood on this

one.

Your barriers up?

Hell yes -- and we're pushing the

overflow into the side-streets.

We aren't gonna win any new friends,

Do we ever? How about traffic?

I stuck a patrolman at every inter-

section from 14th to 34th, and

crosstown from 2nd to 5th.

Who's your Number Two?

BOROUGH CO01N NDER

Deputy Chief Inspector Daniels --

63.

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - VARIOUS SHOTS

as we see what the Borough Commander describes -- RIOT

POLICE, armored and helmeted, scurrying into positions,

resembling a commando raid.

BOROUGH COMMANDER'S VOICE

-- north and south of the train,

well concealed -- all wearing vests

and armed with machine and sub-

machine guns, shot guns, riot guns,

hand guns, tear gas grenades -- and

a half-dozen snipers with night

scopes. We could fight the goddam

third world war down there.

Just make sure they stay out of sight

-- if the hijackers see them we may

have a massacre on our hands.

BOROUGH COMMANDER'S VOICE

We have a sniper's report that

they're moving around inside the

car pretty freely -- and the one

in the motorman's cab is fully

exposed and a damn easy shot.

INT. COMMISSIONER'S CAR

No! Under no cirL:umstances! Do

you understand me, Phil? Absolutely

no! We're taking their threats

seariously. What've you got above

ground?

EXT. 28th STREET - BOROUGH COMMANDER

Again, if feasible, we can see what he describes.

64.

BOROUGH COMMA DIDER

Trucks, cars, emergency, medical

and rescue units, searchlights,

bullhorns -- the works, Phil.

I've got two men stationed at

every emergency exit as far south

as Union Square.

Any direct communications with the

hijackers?

Negative. It's awkward as hell.

The T.A. Command Center in Brooklyn

has the only direct contact.

INTO COMMISSIONER'S CAR

Harry, tell me something, will you?

They're in a tunnel -- surrounded

on all sides, top and bottom -- how

the hell do they expect to get away?

71 PHONE (BOROUGH COMMANDER)

Beats the shit out of me, Phil.

EXT. GRACIE MANSION - DAY

as the Commissioner's car swings into the circular drive

leading to the side entrance and comes to a lurching stop,

the siren trailing off, behind three other official black

limousines. The Commissioner jumps out and trots up onto

the verandah.

INT. MAYOR'S BEDROOM - DAY

CLOSE SHOT - THE MAYOR

as he-sneezes into a Kleenex. As CAMERA PULLS BACK he

dries off his upper lip, wads the tissue and throws it

.onto the floor. JESSIE, his wife, with frosted hair and

harlequin glasses, jumps up from a chair and retrieves it.

Nate, for God's sake.

She baskets it, then turns to Warren LaSalle.

Warren -- tell him other Mayors have

to use the house after we're gone.

65.

There's a knock and Warren hurries to open the door. in

walk three men: The Commissioner, the CONTROLLER and the

CHAIRMAN of the Transit Authority.

Thanks for coming up on short

notice, fellas -- you all know

Jessie, don't you? The Police

Commissioner -- the Controller --

the Chairman of the Transit

Authority -- ?

Yes, it's nice to see you again.

Mrs. Mayor --

Hi, Jess --

Good afternoon.--

Coffee for everybody -- and some

cake?

Uh -- better skip it, Jessie --

we're running a little short of

time. We all know what's going

on underground, right? So the

main issue is whether to pay the

ransom or not. All the rest is

secondary. Phil? What do you

think?

Well -- we're fully mobilized --

I can go down there any time you

say with enough firepower to wipe

out an army -- but I can't guarantee

the safety of the 'hostages.

In other words, you're for paying

the rarlsom.

We don't want another Attica on

our hands, do we?

66.

So your vote is -- ?

I abstain.

Shit. Barny?

The safety of the passengers is

the only concern of the Transit

Authority.

Your vote?

Pay the two dollars.

Sure -- two dollars I'd pay!

But it's a million, Barfly -- a

one with six zeroes! Is it coming

out of your pccket?

Come on, Sid -- save the poor-

mouth for later. How do you vote?

I'm not through discussing it yet.

Yes you are. Now vote.

My concern is with the taxpayers

-- someone's oughta be. "Millions

for defense but not one cent for

tribute!"

So that's a no. All right, Nate --

you've heard from the Three Wise

Men -- what do you say?

Everyone turns to the Mayor. He sneezes into a Kleenex

and tosses it onto the floor.

What're they gonna say, Warren?

67 .

They who?

Everybody -- the press, the man on

the street --

He means the voters.

Just what you'd expect -- the Times

will support you on purely humani-

tarian grounds -- the News'11 knock

you for coddling criminals -- and

the Post will take both sides at

the same time. As for public

opinion -- you'll carry Manhattan,

lose Queens and Staten Island, and

split down the middle in Brooklyn

I. stalling.

Stop trying to bully everybody,

Warren -- this is supposed to be

a democracy!

Wise up,. for Chrissake! We're trying

to run a city, not a goddam democracy!

Nate! Stop farting around! We've

got to pay !

What do you say, Jess?

I know a million dollars is a lot

of money -- but just think what

you'll, get in return.

What?

Seventeen sure votes.

68.

Go ahead, Warren -- arrange for the

pay-off.

Halleluja!

(as everyone rises)

You heard it, fellas. Phil --

pass the word to the bad guys

that we're coughing up.

Will do.

Sid -- what bank do we do the most

business with?

City National Trust -- I'll give

'em a call.

I'll call -- you're liable to spend

an hour trying to knock down the

interest rate. Come on -- everyone

downstairs -- let's move it!

The Mayor and Jessie are left alone. She picks up the

crumpled Kleenex.

I thought I handled it all right.

A regular Fiorello LaGuardia.

INT. SUBWAY - FIRST CAR - MOTORMAN'S CAB

CLOSE SHOT - CROSSWORD PUZZLE

as Blue's hand is busy filling in a word. A knock is heard

and CAMERA PULLS BACK as Blue opens the door. Green enters.

Nothing yet?

(as Blue shakes his head)

They're sure taking their time.

Don't worry -- they're going to pay.

They have no choice.

69.

The hostages. Yeah. At first I

thought to myself, "Five of 'em are

spades -- who's gonna pay anything

for spades?" But they don't know

who we've got, do they?

It wouldn't matter if all seventeen

were dope pushers -- they have to pay,

so relax.

I know they have to -- but what if

they don't?

Then a lot of people are going to

die.

Including us.

Either you live or you die.

Living's better.

It depends. It's Y not better than

trying to sell mutual funds, for

example.

Did you do that?

I tried.

I thought you were in the army.

I was. That's where I developed

my expensive tastes.

In the army? Sure' -- on three-fifty

a month.

70.

The Biafrans paid me twenty-five

hundred for leading a battalion.

A month? Holy Christ l Why'd

you ever get out of that?

The market dried up.

At least you weren't fired. But

shit, I didn't mind -- who wants

to drive a goddam subway train for

the rest of.his life?

What'd they nail you for?

Nothing! They framed me -- the

goddam Beakies had to find a fall-

guy and they --

Beakies?

Transit inspectors -- undercover

men. They got wind of a gang passing

dope -- you know, transporting it

from downtown to uptown, giving it

to a motorman, and then someone

picking it up in Harlem. The

Beakies tried to pin it on me,

but they never had any evidence..

You were innocent?

Hell yes, I was innocentl Do you

think I'd do anything like that?

Yes.

INT. GRACIE MANSION - LASALLE' S OFFICE - DAY

Warren sits on the edge of his desk, on the phone.

71.

City National Trust? -- the Chairman

of the Board, please? --

This is Warren LaSalle in the

mayor's office -- may I speak to

the Chairman, please?

The Chairman is on an overseas call

at the moment --

I don't care if he's talking to the

moon -- get your ass inside that

of fice and put him on the line!

He lights a cigarette while he waits.

Good afternoon, Mr. LaSalle -- what

is it I can do for you?

A subway train's been hijacked.

Unless we can deliver a million

dollars within --

(checks his watch)

-- twenty-eight minutes, seventeen

people will be assassinated.

INT. BANK CHAIRMAN'S OFFICE - DAY

The BANK CHAIRMAN is a silver-haired man in his sixties,

sitting behind a large desk; on the phone.

A subway train -- how very original.

A million, you say?

INTERCUT - WARREN & BANK CHAIRMAN

Yes, sir -- is there any problem

about that much cash being available?

None whatsoever. We're members of

the Federal Reserve.

Swell. Then will you arrange for us

to be given that amount right away?

72.

Given? I'm not sure I urde-rstand

what you mean by "given," Mr.

LaSalle.

Lent, of course -- I didn't expect

it as a gift --

Lent to whom, Mr. LaSalle?

To us, goddammit -- the sovereign city

of New York --

Yes, well, there are certain techni-

calities involved in such a trans-

action, Mr. LaSalle -- terms,

duration, signatures --

There isn't time for all that -- I

But "all that," as you put it,

happens to be what we do for a

living, Mr. LaSalle --

Listen to me, you stupid goddam

piece of shit! if you don't come

through in five seconds flat I will

er ssona Illy find a violation in every

in c h ofplumbing and wiring in every

branch you've got in this whole

fucking city!

The Chairman looks as though he's been struck between the

eyes. After a pause, he speaks z.iietly:

Do you know something, Mr. LaSalle?

In my entire sixty-seven years no

one's ever spoken to me like that.

EXT. EAST RIVER DRIVE - UN BUILDING - DAY

you with further instructions.

About your getaway?

I'm signing off now.

It might interest you to know I've

figured out how you're going to do

Yes -- it would interest me.

76.

You're going to make every man,

woman and child in New York City

close their eyes and count to a

hundred.

It's two-forty-seven, Prescott

you have twenty-six minutes.

What? Don't be stupid -- we've

agreed to pay the money. Now

turn off the clock.

Twenty-six minutes, Prescott.

MED. SHOT - PRESCOTT

Look -- your instructions are

complicated! The money has to be

counted, stacked, tied, transported

all the way uptown -- it just isn't

physically possible!

You'd be surprised what's physically

possible. The clock's running,

Prescott.

All right. At least let us pick

up that man you shot. We want to

send a. stretcher for him.

Negative.

But he may still be alive

He's dead.

But you can't be sure --

Very well -- we'll put another half

77.

dozen rounds into him so everyone

can be sure. Over and out.

Prescott turns and sees that the others, at nearby desks,

have been watching and listening. He stares back at them

for a moment., then checks his watch.

PRE SCO TT

Twenty-five minutes -- after that

we can start scratching them off

-- one per minute.

INT. SUBWAY - FIRST CAR - PASSENGERS - BLUE'S POV

SHOOTING down the length of the car. Most of the Passengers

excepting the Wino Lady and the Hippie. Both are enjoying

their own reveries.

Your attention please --

At the far end, Brown guards the rear door. At mid-car,

Grey stands with his legs astride.

Including Blue and, behind him, at the front storm door,

Green.

The city has agreed to pay for

your release.

No one quite knows how to greet this news -- except the Pimp

who slowly, mockingly, claps his hands together.

Far out, man --

Blue starts forward, walking slowly, looking at passengers

on both sides of the aisle as he goes.

As soon as the money gets here --

will you let us go?

No -- but soon afterwards.

78.

Do you mind telling us now how much

you're getting?

What difference does it make?

A person likes to know his worth.

A million dollars.

Each?

Altogether.

That's not so terrific..

Blue, still walking toward mid-car, stops at the Hippie's

estended legs and taps the soles of his sandals with the

muzzle of his submachine gun.

Pull in your feet -- someone's

liable to get hurt.

The. Hippie looks up at him, smiles, and slides his feet

back. Blue continues until he comes to Grey. He speaks

quietly to him.

Stop fooling around with that

girl, Mr. Grey.

What's the big deal? She's a

twenty buck a trick hooker.

I said leave her alone.

Don't worry -- I could do this

job and hump that broad at the

same time -- without missing a

stroke.

79.

I once ordered a man shot for

talking to me that way.

That's the difference between us,

Mr. Blue -- I've always done my

own killing.

Maybe we'll get a chance to work

that out.

about to stroke, the office intercom buzzes. A little

annoyed, he crosses to his desk.

Yes -- ?

The Chairman of the City National

SPEAKERPHONE (B .CHAIR . )

I don't think you're following me,

Henry --.a million dollars, that's

One million? My secretary said

it was important. What are you

It's ransom money -- a subway

Would you feel more secure if,

instead of eight hours a day, the

Twenty-four hours minimum.

What do you think of all this?

Terrific -- really terrific! What's

INT. FEDERAL RESERVE - THIRD FLOOR - DAY (SILENT)

The President comes out of an elevator, is let through an

iron gate by a GUARD who unlocks it, locks it again, then

turns to unlock a second gate, allowing the President to

turns right.

INT. TUNNEL - PATROLMAN JAMES

Still stuck behind the pillar, standing rigidly so as not

INT. GRACIE MANSION - MAYOR'S BEDROOM - DAY

as Warren enters without knocking.

It's totally out of the question,

Mr. LaSalle.

Nobody asked you!

Warren, for Chrissake, I'm sick as a

goat. What's the point?

The point, you dumb cluck, is that

the Mayor of the City of New York,

trailing by twenty-two points in all

the polls, cares enough about seven-

teen citizens in jeopardy to make a

personal appearance in their behalf!

85.

You know what'll happen -- what

always happens -- I'll get booed.

The Doctor starts taking the Mayor's pulse.

This is a very sick man.

(slapping his hand)

Let go of that! You're off the

case! Look, Nate, all you have to

do is say a few words to the hi-

jackers over a bullhorn -- make a

dignified plea for mercy

Do you think it will help?

Of course it'll help!

The hostages?

No, You.

Warren -- suppose the hijackers

start shooting at me --

Will you stop? They've got no

reason to shoot at you.

You mean they're from. out-of -town?

INT. FEDERAL RESERVE - COUNTING/SORTING - DAY (SILENT)

The SORTERS, mostly women, occupy a large office of. the bull-

pen variety. Each is sorting bills by denomination from a

only to throw old, overused bills away into a basket.

INT. FEDERAL RESERVE - COUNTING - DAY (SILENT)

A single CLERK is now assembling the ransom money. He

selects ten bundles of fifties and five bundles of hundreds

bands.

INT. SUBWAY - FIRST CAR - MOTORMAN'S CAB

Blue, as Green enters the cab.

I heard you on the radio -- anything

They've requested more time.

How much more?

Ten minutes.

I guess it won't hurt anything.

I 'didn't -give it to them.

Suppose they can't make it?

Then we do what we said we'd do.

There's no other way.

Maybe an hour wasn't enough time

89.

An hour's plenty! You know how the

system works -- you give them two

hours and they take two -- three

and they take three. An hour's

plenty!

And what if it isn't?

Do you think we'll actually have

to do it?

I don't know. They're running

pretty late.

INT. FEDERAL RESERVE - COUNTING - DAY (SILENT)

CLOSE SHOT - MILLION DOLLARS

It is now neatly piled together -- the fifteen thousand

holding one end of the money sack, each with his gun

drawn, and head for the Police Truck. The time is

They throw it into the front seat on Ricci's side and slam

the door. The motorcycles are already starting to move,

shoving off, their sirens wailing and the truck starts

after them.

EXT. MAI,)EN LANE & NASSAU STREET - DAY

A COP on the corner waves the procession -- motorcycles and

truck -- right on Nassau, one of the narrowest streets in

the city -- cars are parked half up on the sidewalk -- and

they head uphill toward John Street.

WENTWORTH ' S POV (UNDERCRANKED )

SHOOTING through the windshield from the Driver's point-

traffic pulling over (and the expressions on the drivers'

faces) as the truck careens through.

INT. POLICE TRUCK - [WENTWORTH & RICCI

Wentworth is grinning, really enjoying himself. Ricci,

holding the sack of money on his lap, is scowling.

Beautiful -- really beautiful!

out of"control, topple over, sending their drivers sprawling.

The truck slams on its brakes,.screeching to a stop just

short of the pile-up.

EXT. PARK AVENUE & 28TH STREET - DAY

A SERGEANT manning the radio at the Command Post shouts to

the Borough Commander who is off to one side, issuing orders

to a small squad of policemen.

Sir -- there's been an accident --

Jesus Christ, I don't believe it!

He starts for the radio in one of the vehicles. The time

"3:10 'F.

He grabs the mike.

This is the Borough Commander --

Does it make any difference?

I guess not.

Fourteen-David crossing Houston,

Wentworth is bent over the wheel, all determination now.

Tell him I'm doing over sixty now!

Hold on -- I'm going through -- !

SHOOTING THROUGH the windshield (as the SUPERIMPOSED time

continues to run: "3:12.26-27-28-29--") The tail-lights

of the cycles are twinkling red'as they begin braking --

a tractor-trailer is stretched across the street, lining

up its rear-end with the narrow opening of a loading

bay, in preparation for backing into it. Now the truck

starts backing, and while there is still some space open

(on the sidewalk) it is closing fast. The cycles screech

to a stop but it is clear that the truck doesn't intend to

as it bumps up onto the sidewalk, and starts for the

opening. But it is now too narrow. The screeching brakes

of the truck are heard as it starts to skid around, the

panorama flashing by sickeningly and, perhaps, a crash

and, perhaps, the scene flopping over as the truck,

perhaps, rolls over onto one side.

EXT. LAFAYETTE STREET - DAY

The Police Truck lying on its side, its wheels still

spinning, the siren still running eerily. And the SUPER-

IMPOSED time still running: "3:12.38-39-40-41--"

Hello, Prescott -- the truck's

What do you want me to do?! We

What do you mean, that's all?!

They're just about to shoot some

What do they expect us to do?

If they know we're wrecked how can

They don't know anything, for

Chrissake! How can they know

Holy shit, that's it!!

He punches a button on the console as the SUPERIMPOSED

Pelham One Two. Three -- ! The money's

You made it just in time, Prescott.

The SUPERIMPOSED 'time freezes: 113:59.58.6." Prescott exhales

sharply and sits back in his chair, exhausted. The SUPER-

IMPOSED numbers disappear.

You still there, Prescott?

100.

Yeah. I'm still here. Tell me

something -- if we were a couple

of seconds late -- you'd have

knocked off an innocent person?

Affirmative. Now if you're ready,

I'll give you instructions for

the delivery of the money. Again,

I'll have to insist you follow

them to the letter.

Go ahead.

Two unarmed policemen will walk

down the track -- one with the

money, the other with a light which

he'll flash continuously from side

to side in a sweeping motion.

When they reach the car the rear

door will open and the one with

the money will throw it in onto

the floor. Then they will both

turn and walk back to the 28th

Street Station. Acknowledge.

I've got it. Is that all?

For now. But keep it in mind

that the same ground rules apply

-- any wrong move by anyone and

we'll kill a hostage.

I could've. guessed that part.

You have ten minutes to deliver the

money. If it isn't here by then --

Yeah, I know -- -it's getting mono-

tonous. I don't suppose you'll give

us longer than ten minutes --

Ten's more than enough, Prescott

1 01.

unless you weren't telling the

truth about the money having

PRESCO'.i12T

It's all right, ten minutes is fine.

No further discussions then.

When we have the money in hand

of instructions.

The clock's running, Prescott

I've got three-fourteen -- you've

got until three-twenty-four.

Over.

Over. Over, you bastard.

EXT. PARK AVENUE & 28TH STREET - DAY

as two motorcycles, sirens blasting, push their way through

the crowd and stop at the Borough Commander's command post.

One driver alights and goes to help the other remove the

canvas sack of money off the back of the second bike. They

carry it together to the Borough Commander.

Well, it's about fucking time!

You two --

(MISKOWSXY) and .a Tactical Policeman (O'KEEFE) -- standing

together drinking coffee out of containers. They hurry

over and salute.

Which one has the flashlight?

I do, sir --

He shows it hanging from his belt.

102.

All right -- then you

carry the money. Now move it --

you've only got about eight and

a half minutes.

(as they salute)

Never mind the goddam salutes

just get going!

They take the sack from. the cyclists, hike it up onto

O'Keefe's shoulder and hurry off, running down the steps

into the subway.

Now a chorus of booing is heaxd.

BOROUGH C0124ANDER

Christ, it's the goddam Mayor!

I don't see him --

The Mayor, wrapped in a blanket, is smiling and nodding

as he passes through the crowd, led by a wedge of COPS,

flanked on one side by the Commissioner, and on the other

by Warren LaSalle. The BoroughrCommander waits for him,

shaking his head in disgust.

And to think that I voted for the

ba stard .

The Mayorand entourage join him.

Hello, Commander -- His Honor wants

to go down into the tunnel with a

bullhorn and make a personal appeal

to the hijackers.

I'm afraid not.

I wasn't asking for your permission

-- all you have to do is clear the

way.

103.

The Commander looks at the Commissioner who stares right

back, blankly. Then he turns to the Mayor.

I appreciate your wanting to

help, sir, but you've come at

a very bad time.

Mr. Commissioner, will you order

your man to comply?

Cool it, Warren'-- the Commander

knows the situation here and we

don't.

Nate -- I'm warning you --

I feel shitty, Warren -- I'm going

back to bed.

The Mayor turns and starts back through the crowd, Warren

chasing after him.

at the rear storm door.

MED. CLOSE SHOT - JAMES

Standing behind his pillar. Now he turns his peaked cap

around and, turning his face to the pillar, slowly moves

his head to one side.

105.

MED. SHOT - FIRST CAR - JAMES' POV

SHOOTING from behind the pillar. As the CAMERA slowly

CRABS, the subway car comes into view -- and we see Brown

standing at the rear door, much more clearly than before..

MED. CLOSE SHOT - JAMES

as he. peeks around the pillar. Now, slowly, he brings his

right hand up and, pointing his index finger.like a gun,

"fires."

P'choo, p'choo, p'choo --

He blows imaginary smoke from the end of his finger, pleased

with himself.

Shiiiiiit.

From the other side of the pillar as James ducks back behind

it, turns his back to it and looks around for another way

of amusing himself. He notices his real gun in a holster

at his belt and unbuttons the strap, freeing it. Then he

assumes the stance of a gunfighter, hand poised over it,

knees slightly bent. Then, moving suddenly, he slaps his

holster, wheels, fires without aiming -- and there's a

reverberating BANG, the shattering of glass and the figure

in the subway car reels back. James looks at his hand in

amazement -- there's no gun in it. Then, at the same-time,

Brown has recovered his balance and begins firing his

submachine gun, the bullets ricocheting off the metal

pillars.

MED. SHOT - MISKOWSKY & O'KEEFE

as they drop onto the roadbed, bullets whining all around

them.

For Chrissake, they're shooting

O'Keefe pushes the sack of money in front of them and they

press flat behind it.

INT. FIRST CAR

Blue is hurrying from the Conductor's cab to the rear of the

car, passing between the two rows of stunned passengers

who watch in silence. The storm door window has been smashed

106.

and there is glass all over the floor nearby. Brown is

just in the process of sitting heavily in the single

isolated seat near the door, a dark red patch blossoming

on his sleeve, just below the right shoulder, his sub-

machine gun resting in his lap. He begins examining his

wound with his left hand. Grey s--ands at the rear door,

pressed flat against the wall, peering out.

Return to your position, Mr. Grey.

Maybe they're not through --

You heard me, Mr. Grey! I don't

think there'll be any more.

Reluctantly, Grey goes back to mid-car.

It's not too bad -- I think it

went right through.

Blue spots something, bends and picks up a lump of metal

which he tosses to Brown who watches it in his bloodied left

hand, glances at it, then throws it away.

How does it feel?

BROWN.

Okay -- I never feel pain too much.

How many shots were there?

Just one -- the rest was me. I

didn't see anything -- I guess I

just got mad -- no sense to it --

Somebody got nervc..us -- or bored

-- they've been out there a long

time. We can't let it pass.

I'm not mad any more -- forget it.

Acting on whose orders?

I don't know -- maybe nobody's.

You mean somebody just took it

into his head to fire? On his

That's right, conductor. Would

Why? -- what are you going to do?

There's something you can help us

with.

Bud still hesitates.

Don't worry, conductor -- come

He leads Bud by the arm back to the rear of the car, every

Passen gar's eye on the conductor as he passes, his free

hand moving from overhead strap to strap.

All you have to do is walk uptrack

about a hundred feet and wait for

the men delivering the money.

They have reached the rear where Bud manages to avoid looking

at Brown while Blue slides open the door.

I'll help you down onto the track.

Why do I have to go -- ?

But why?! We're still under the

Somebody threw a shot at them --

now they're showing us they're men

Who the hell fired at them?

Nobody knows. My bet is we never will.

How far did the money get?

They continue toward the first car.

Blue now opens the rear door as the flashlight's beam sweeps

across the back end of the car. Now Miskowsky and O'Keefe

appear -- only their faces peering into the car. O'Keefe

tosses the sack off his shoulder onto the car's floor and it

lands with a thud. Miskowsky and O'I :eefe look up at Blue

and Brown who merely stare back. No one speaks. Then the

two policemen turn and go. Blue now busies himself with

opening the neck of the sack, then lifting the other end so

that the 75 bricks of money spill out onto the floor in a

heap.

Get your things off -- both of

you -- and start loading up.

Blue watches while both Grey and :Brown remove their

raincoats, jackets and finally their shirts. Brown has a

blood-stained kerchief tied around his right upper arm.

Both wear what can only be called money vests: canvas,

sleeveless, fitting over the head like a Mae West, with ties

on the sides, and containing pockets, 20 in all, front and

back.

113.

Jr. Grey, you do Mr. Brown, then

he'll do you -- nineteen packets

each.

Blue continues to observe for a mc-,ment as Grey starts

inserting packets of pills, one to a pocket, into Brown's

vest, as Brown stands stiffly, his hands at his sides.

Then Blue walks to the front end of the car, joining Green.

All that money -- I can't believe

When they're finished it'll be

your turn. Mr. Grey will load

you up. But don't go down there

until Nr. Brown has come here to

instructions. Each one i.s.to be

followed precisely -- is that

clear?

So far.

114.

One: at the end of this conversation

you will restore power to the entire

sector.

Restore power --

Twos you will clear the local track

all the way from 28th Street to

South Ferry. By clear I mean

switches properly set and all

signals green. I emphasize green,

Prescott -- if eve so much as see

a red light, let alone get tripped

by one, we will shoot a hostage.

Local track cleared to South Ferry

and all signals green --

Three.: all southbound trains

behind us, local and express, are

to remain lying dead. Likewise

all northbound between South Ferry

and here.

Got it --

Four: you will con-",act me as soon

as the track is clear and all

signals are green.

Go ahead --

Five: you will remove all police

personnel from the tunnel. If we

see a single cop between here and

South Ferry we will shoot a hostage.

In fact, any deviation from these

instructions and we will shoot a

hostage.

115.

Are you aware that you're insane?

(after a pause)

Let me know when all five points

have been complied with. Over

Prescott sits back for a moment, thinking. Then he punches

a button.

Sol -- you there -- ?

Daniels -- ? This is Prescott --

Daniels, I've got Lieutenant Garber

of the Transit Police on the line

with us. I have the latest instructions

from the hijackeraa. They want power

restored, the tracks cleared, all

signals green as far as South Ferry,

and no cops anywhere. Okay, so we

go along -- we have to -- but then

what? What do you think they've

got in mind?

Don't all talk at once.

INTERCUT a- PRESCOTT, GARBER & DANIELS

Beats hell out of me, Clive. I

wouldn't've picked a tunnel to

make my getaway from in the first

place.

But they did pick it'-- and since

everything they've done so far has

116.

been organized down to tha

smallest detail, it stands to

reason they've got the rest

worked out, too.

GARBER.

Power restored and the track cleared

-- so they're gonna move their

car, obviously. But why South

Ferry?

If I remember right it comes

after Bowling Green -- what

comes after South Ferry?

Bowling Green again -- the track

loops around and heads back uptown.

All they'll do is bottle themselves

up. That's no good.

So that means they want South

Ferry. Why?

Do you think it's the water, Sol?

Maybe they've got a boat waiting

in the harbor -- dr a seaplane --

Who knows? We'd.better play it

a step at a time. Clive, you see

about restoring power and clearing

.the track. Daniels and I'll start

pulling our units out of the tunnel.

We can follow them just as well

up above, on the street.

How'1l we know where they are?

Grand Central Tower has 'em on

their model board -- we can see

every move they make. If they

stop anywhere before South Ferry

we'll know about it.

117.

We'd better put some men on all

of the emergency exits just in

case. I'll check back in when

I've found a squad car I can use.

Wait a minute! I think I just

figured out how they're gonna

get away!

I'm listening --

They're gonna fly the train

to Cuba!

you don't have any buses?! -- go

don't I?

You don't -- not yet.

Jesus! Do you realize that in

Will you shut up and listen?

I've got a new set of instructions.

I don't give a rat's ass for your

fucking instructions! I'm not doing

anything to help the killers of

Caz Dolowitz!

Prescott reaches into his pocket, removes his service

revolver and, grabbing Correll by the chin, pushes his head

back and places the muzzle of the gun into his eye.

If you don't do what I tell you,

Frank, you'll be having dinner

tonight with Caz Dolowitz.

unharmed in a short while, but until

then you must continue doing exactly

The train starts to move. As it does, Green tugs sharply

back on the pipe and the two longer sections, angled

to lose his balance but Brawn grabs him and pulls him back

What did it look like?

I don't know -- a shadow -- could've

Without any warning, Blue, whose Wright hand has been in

his pocket, fires his pistol through his coat, catching

f Grey full in the chest. He staggers back, bumps against

the tunnel wall and collapses, landing on his side. Blue

bends, pries the submachine gun 'Loose from Grey's death

grip, removes the magazine, pockets it, and tosses the gun

away. Green has watched all this in near panic.

Some of the Passengers have gone to the front of the car.

impotently against it. The Mother remains in her seat

holding her two boys pressed against her. Now the Old Man

He returns his attention to the business of locating his

gun. He scrapes the heel of an extended leg (to his extreme

discomfort) along the ground hoping to discover it -- and

does. Seeing it, he now goes through the painful exercise

of reaching for it -- finally managing this, too. Now,

lifting one knee as a gun mount, he holds the revolver in

both hands and starts to take aim.

with the gun in the foreground, its sight being shifted as

the three men are preparing to leave through the emergency

exit. Now the Hippie's vision (FOCUS) blurs for a moment,

the door and Brown is right behind him. The gunsight centers

on Brown's broad back -- and the gun fires. Brown convulses

and topples backwards.

the well of the emergency exit, beside the metal ladder

that leads up through a grate and out onto the street.

Between them, before the open doorway to the well, Brown's

body lies face up on the ground. Green now gestures for

Blue to come across the open area separating then.

Come on -- i

I'd never make it -- I

Green hesitates, looks up the ladder, looks back at Blue.

Blue looks at him fora moment, then checks his pistol and,

slowly, steps out from behind the pillar. A shot rings out

immediately and the ricochet off the pillar zings loudly.

Blue calmly fires twice at the muzzle flash.

Both shots have connected, one hitting his arm and sending

the pistol flying away, the other into his upper chest,

below the right shoulder. He topples over, sprawling

across one rail, onto the roadbed.

turn his head away. Then there's a shot -- and Blue

crumples to the ground, dead.
