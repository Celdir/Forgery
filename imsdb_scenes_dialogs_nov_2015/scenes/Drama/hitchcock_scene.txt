Based on the book Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho by

EXT. MARSHLAND - DUSK

We move across smoldering embers and reach a small grass

fire. Dirt is thrown over the flames before a BOOT finishes

stamping them out.

SUPER: PLAINFIELD, WISCONSIN, 1944

We move up two dirty pairs of overalls to find HENRY and ED

GEIN sweating away as they continue shovelling out the

flames. Both are in their forties and wearing flannel shirts.

Ed wears an Elmer Fudd hat.

Henry looks at Ed and he shrinks back.

CLANG. Henry is hit by the shovel in the back of the head and

goes down.

Ed steps slowly forward and puts down the shovel. The look on

his face isn't anger. It's BLANK. He pulls at the flaps of

his Elmer Fudd hat... then calmly walks away.

The camera pans until we discover :

in his trademark black Mariani suit. He's been watching the

whole thing, standing in the smouldering field only a few

feet away, holding a rose-patterned cup and saucer of tea...

He takes a sip and turns to address the camera --

He places his cup daintily back on the saucer.

He glances back over at the murder scene.

He shrugs: `Who would've thought it?'

A RAPID MONTAGE OF CLIPS

from various Technicolor Films of the era: Peyton Place, with

Lana Turner and Betty Field. Pillow Talk with Doris Day and

Rock Hudson. A Summer Place with Sandra Dee --

EXT. MARSHLAND - AS BEFORE

He shudders with distaste. As if on cue the sky THUNDERS

LOUDLY above him. He looks up and from behind the tree stump

produces an umbrella.

As Hitch opens his brolly and the RAIN starts to bucket down

EXT. MARQUEE OF UNITED ARTISTS THEATER, CHICAGO - NIGHT

Equally torrential rain lit up by rotating KLEIG LIGHTS as

they scan a MARQUEE: "WORLD PREMIERE! NORTH BY NORTHWEST.

DIRECTED BY ALFRED HITCHCOCK." JOSTLING CROWDS run the length

of the block.

SUPER: JULY 8, 1959.

A PUDGY HAND discreetly squeezes a tiny, delicate one.

ALFRED AND ALMA HITCHCOCK

Step out into a sea of FLASHBULBS. Hitch basks in the

limelight while Alma, his razor-sharp, charming wife of over

30 years stands in the background, uncomfortable with all the

attention.

Hitchcock's agent LEW WASSERMAN, 45, dynamic, charismatic,

comes into view.

Lew hustles them through the throng of REPORTERS and

PHOTOGRAPHERS under their BLACK UMBRELLAS.

The blonde fan, holding out her autograph book, shakes her

head `no' and giggles.

The reporters crack up. Alma manages a polite smile as Lew

helps her into the limo, leaving Hitchcock alone for a moment

to sign his autograph for the blond fan...

HOLDING ON HITCHCOCK

motionless and quietly devastated as FLASHBULBS CRACKLE over

his face. The whiteness transforms into...

INT. THE HITCHCOCKS' BEL AIR HOME - BATHROOM - MORNING

THE GLEAMING WHITE TILES of a bathroom. We move past chrome

fixtures that evoke those in Spellbound and Psycho and arrive

at that same pudgy hand pouring CHATEAU CHEVAL BLANC '53 into

a cut crystal glass.

soaks in the tub. The champagne glass beside him, his

corpulent frame is covered only by the London Times he's

reading. Even in this deeply vulnerable state, he maintains

the air of a haughty mischievous emperor.

At the sound of a bedroom bureau being opened, Hitch's eyes

shift to the FULL-LENGTH MIRROR on the bathroom door.

IN THE MIRROR

We catch fleeting glimpses of Alma in a white half-slip and

matching bra. She takes out some NYLONS and holds them up to

the light.

Hitchcock watches enthralled. He puts down his glass and

shifts a little in the tub, causing the water to lap against

the sides.

BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Alma pauses when she hears the small splashes. Neither upset

nor amused she continues about her business, taking a skirt

from the drawer.

Hitchcock clears his throat, rattling his paper as if he'd

been reading the whole time.

Alma steps into her skirt as Hitch opens the London Times.

Hitchcock zeroes in on the photographs. They're all young.

Thinner. And with hair.

He catches his reflection in the mirror again and sinks

further down into the water to hide his protruding belly.

Alma comes in, takes the newspapers from him and puts them on

the side.

She puts down the TOILET SEAT and sits on it.

She comes over and kisses the top of his head.

She moves off to the mirror to apply lipstick and Hitchcock

surreptitiously picks up the papers again...

Alma steps back to inspect herself in the full-length mirror.

Today's outfit is, we sense, rather more stylish than what

she would ordinarily wear.

Hitch's gaze never leaves the photo gallery of his younger

rivals in the `New Masters of Suspense' article...

As she elegantly masks her hurt.

She leaves. Hitch grumbles and tosses his paper aside. He

rises from the depths but suddenly loses his balance and

grabs onto the SHOWER CURTAIN, wrenching it from the METAL

RINGS on the rod.

A GOD'S EYE view, looking down, as Hitchcock stares up at the

metal rings SPINNING NOISILY on the metal rod.

EXT. THE PARAMOUNT STUDIOS, BRONSON GATE - DAY

The FAMOUS MOUNTAIN TOP icon looms large. TWO GUARDS snap-to

for the arrival of Hollywood royalty.

Alma waves from the wheel of a GLEAMING BLACK 1957 CADILLAC.

Hitchcock sits next to her. He has his two SEALYHAM TERRIERS

on his lap. He nods, awaiting more.

EXT. PARAMOUNT STUDIOS, PRODUCERS' BUILDING - DAY

The Cadillac pulls up. Alma notes Hitchcock's look of

frustrated envy as CREW MEMBERS bustle in and out of STAGE

15. It's a hive of activity.

He gives her a good-bye peck and opens the door.

Alma hands him a compact Fortnum & Mason basket and pats him

on his girth. He opens it to discover CELERY AND CARROT

STICKS wrapped in Saran.

INT. HITCHCOCK'S OFFICE, PARAMOUNT - DAY

Luxurious, wood-paneled and very British. Hitch sits

restlessly behind his desk, receiving his morning shave from

his private barber, SILVIO. His longtime assistant, PEGGY

ROBERTSON, 40s, crisp, British, fiercely protective of her

boss, is going through a list of potential projects.

Hitch directs his response to Silvio.

Hitch reaches for a carrot stick and CRUNCHES it.

Silvio nods, then recommences the shave.

Silvio unintentionally nicks Hitch's face.

Silvio hurriedly dabs away a speck of BLOOD.

Hitch motions for the barber to hold up the mirror. The image

of his face overflows the small frame. Repulsed, he leans

back his head and makes a hand motion for Silvio to SLIT HIS

THROAT.

CONTAGIOUS LAUGHTER (PRE-LAP)

INT. CHASEN'S RESTAURANT - DAY

Alma lunches with screenwriter-novelist WHITFIELD COOK.

"WHIT," 50s, is Hitchcock's physical opposite -- dashing,

razor-sharp and sophisticated. In fact he'd be at home in one

of his movies.

They laugh uproariously, quite at ease with each other.

He pours Alma another glass of wine, not remotely insulted.

He clinks her glass.

Alma turns to look at the menu again.

He laughs, his eyes straying to a PRETTY WAITRESS passing by.

Alma notices.

Whit brings out a set of galleys and slides them across the

tablecloth to her.

She looks down and reads the cover page. "Taxi to Dubrovnik.

By Whitfield Cook."

He touches her hand, affectionately. She brushes it away,

affectionately...

She looks through the opening pages... taking her time...

enjoying making him wait...

INT. HITCHCOCK'S OFFICE, PARAMOUNT - DAY

Hitchcock peeks avidly through the blinds at a smartly

dressed KIM NOVAK-TYPE WOMAN hurrying along to some

appointment or assignation... Hitch cranes to see who she's

meeting, but she moves tantalizingly out of sight.

Hitch turns back with a sigh towards his desk, covered with

discarded newspaper clippings and boring story proposals.

He sweeps them off his desk into the trash.

INT. HITCHCOCK'S OUTER OFFICE - A MOMENT LATER

A SHADOW looms over Peggy at her desk as she sifts through

another round of story ideas. It's Hitchcock. He startles

her.

He starts sifting through her tray. She notices the glass in

his hand.

He drains it playfully.

But something's caught his eye. A circled review of Anthony

Boucher's column "CRIMINAL MINDS" in the New York Times

Review of Books. He picks it up.

He takes the coverage and reads for himself.

He gives a grunt of approval.

INT. HITCHCOCK'S STUDY - THE NEXT NIGHT

Completely engrossed as he sits reading "Psycho" in a chair

by the fire of his elegant Bel Air home. He takes another

gulp of wine when he hears Alma enter and slides the wine

glass out of view. Alma pops her head in the door.

She disappears to take off her coat.

She comes back in again carrying some galleys, notices the

title of Hitch's book -- some trash called "Psycho."

Hitch continues reading.

She taps Hitch's book dismissively with the galleys of "Taxi

to Dubrovnik."

He finally looks up.

As she leaves she points to Hitch's `hidden' wine glass.

But Hitch ignores her and turns to look out the window, his

imagination starting to turn...

INT. GEIN HOUSE, PLAINVIEW, 1945 - NIGHT

Ed enters the bedroom. His mother, Augusta, is in the bed,

faced away from him.

She doesn't answer. We follow him to the dresser where he

lingers a little too long over his mother's open underwear

drawer before grabbing the blue coverlet on the side.

He comes over and spreads the extra blanket over her. Still

wearing his jacket, he takes off his shoes, gets into bed and

crawls up next to her.

As he puts his arm around her and pulls her close, we reveal

his mother's ghoulishly embalmed face.

INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, BEDROOM - NIGHT

A slant of moonlight finds Alma fast asleep until a FINGER

nudges her awake. She lifts her satin sleep mask to see

Hitchcock holding out his copy of "Psycho."

The look of obsession on his face is unmistakable.

He switches on the light by her bedside. She sits up, puts on

her glasses and reads from the opened page.

She hands him back the book.

She turns off the light again and goes back to bed. A deep

voice sounds from the darkness...

EXT. HITCHCOCK'S GARDEN - MORNING

The Hitchcocks eat breakfast on the terrace watching the

GARDENERS trim the bushes and rake leaves from the pool.

Alma can feel Hitch looking at her, waiting for a response.

Clearly he isn't going to let this one go.

She butters her toast, casually taunts him by adding a large

spoon of marmalade.

Hitch falls silent, a chastised schoolboy.

INT. HITCHCOCK'S OFFICE, PARAMOUNT - DAY

Hitch enters with purpose, carrying a stack of photos and

articles.

Hitch heads for his office, in no mood for wise cracks. He

spreads out the articles on the desk. Photos and magazine

articles about Ed Gein...

Peggy stands in the doorway, watching --

Peggy shakes her head.

She walks over, notices the LIFE MAGAZINE headline : "HOUSE

OF HORRORS STUNS NATION." Stark black and white photographs

expose the nightmarish decay of the Gein house...

Peggy watches uneasily as Hitchcock pores over the articles

with delight.

INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - A SUNDAY AFTERNOON

A PIANIST plays a polite version of Al Jolson's "My Mammy".

CLOSE ON A MANILA ENVELOPE clutched in one hand behind

HITCHCOCK'S back as we follow him travel through the party.

The clink of champagne glasses as we reveal the GUESTS saying

HELLO as he passes...

Is now in position in front of the fire place. Around the

coffee table are INVITED GOSSIP COLUMNISTS, including a HEDDA

HOPPER-TYPE. They take in the gory LIFE MAGAZINE article.

He produces the manila envelope from behind his back and

empties THE HORRIFICALLY GORY CRIME SCENE PHOTOGRAPHS inside

onto the coffee table.

Hitch looks down sweetly at the circle of quietly horrified

expressions...

Hitch taps the photo of ED GEIN.

The other columnists scribble down the quote.

Hitch glides off without missing a beat, past the Servers

arriving with more hors d'oeuvres from the kitchen.

He snags a martini and collars Peggy while he's at it.

He looks over at the pantry, where Alma can be glimpsed

through the swinging door, putting food onto trays.

Hitch sees WHIT lean into view and innocently whisper

something into Alma's ear making her laugh.

Hitchcock doesn't notice the joke. He now only has eyes on

the pantry ahead.

He forges on through the guests only to get waylaid by Lew.

It is a classic Hitchcock moment, a character needing to get

someplace being held up by someone who wants to chat --

Hitch smiles tightly and extricates himself, heading on to

the kitchen through more annoying guests --

INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, PANTRY - SIMULTANEOUS

Whit leans against the stove watching Alma expertly arrange

the next round of hors d'oeuvres coming in from the kitchen.

Suddenly, over Whitfield's shoulder, Alma sees Hitch looming

in the doorway. Whit notes the tiny change in her eyes and

turns.

Hitch stares blankly at him while Alma turns and busies

herself over the sink, hiding an almost imperceptible blush.

Hitch sips his martini, a picture of innocence. Then leans in

to Whit's ear and whispers - just like Whit leaned into

Alma's ear a moment earlier.

Peggy appears in the pass-through, beckoning Hitch to hurry

back into the living room.

INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Hitch returns to see the other GUESTS are now passing around

the GEIN PHOTOS. They look utterly confused and horrified...

a couple of them are even gathering their coats.

ON LEW, PEGGY AND HITCH

standing together watching.

He slurps his martini, sharing a smile with Lew.

INT. PARAMOUNT BOARD ROOM - DAY

Paramount President BARNEY BALABAN, 70s, ferocious,

righteous, sits behind his impressive desk flanked by two

CONSERVATIVELY-ATTIRED EXECUTIVES.

Hitchcock and Wasserman sit across from them.

He gestures to the untouched copy of "Psycho" in front of

Balaban.

Hitchcock stares unblinking, giving nothing away.

Hitch's stare remains inscrutable.

Wasserman gives Balaban the same glacial stare. The Paramount

executives shift uncomfortably.

Balaban maintains a calm, pleasant front.

Hitch's suppressed rage is building...but Balaban says

nothing.

EXT. PARAMOUNT COURTYARD - DAY

Hitch and Lew walk down the stairs and through the leafy

courtyard past Hitch's office.

Hitch turns to Lew.

Lew puts a comforting hand on him...

Hitch doesn't respond, Lew sensing the true depth of his

friend's melancholy.

Lew digests the figure...

EXT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, SWIMMING POOL - A FEW DAYS LATER

ALMA does afternoon laps in the pool. A contemplative

Hitchcock wanders down to the pool side wearing black

sunglasses and a business suit. He watches Alma a moment.

Finally she notices him.

He shrugs, then sits at the table to pour himself a glass of

lemonade. Alma gets out and towels herself off.

She sits down next to him, noticing a tiny hole in her

swimsuit. It's starting to look a little threadbare.

He looks off cryptically.

He brushes some fallen leaves off his chair.

He doesn't reply. She knows him well enough too and doesn't

question him further.

She looks at Hitch but he's not joking. She turns to survey

their beloved home and gardens.

A long pause.

Pause.

Without turning he takes her hand.

A long moment as he gazes across the pool.

He turns to look into her eyes for the first time. A glimpse

of the real Hitchcock. Someone even his wife doesn't see that

often...

EXT. PARAMOUNT STUDIOS - DAY

The famous gates and the executive building beyond it.

INT. BALABAN'S PRIVATE OFFICE, PARAMOUNT - DAY

Balaban watches Hitchcock and Lew closely. Hitchcock again is

like a waxworks Buddha, revealing nothing.

A long silence.

Balaban takes in their inscrutable stares. Not unimpressed by

their chutzpah, he leans back and puts his hands behind his

head, a king in his counting room.

Finally, Hitchcock speaks up :

He pulls out his PERSONAL CHECKBOOK and opens it on the desk.

Barney watches as Hitch takes the onyx fountain pen from its

mount.

INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

Hitch and Alma lie side by side in their separate beds. A

copy of "The Dance of Death" by Strindberg lies on Hitch's

bedside table. All traces of his bravado are gone...

INT. HITCHCOCK'S OFFICE, PARAMOUNT - DAY

PUDGY FINGERS part the slats of the blind. Hitch stares out

hoping for some human moment to spy on. He's restless...

Peggy ushers JOSEPH STEFANO, 30s, into Hitch's office.

Hitchcock leaves Stefano's hand dangling in mid air and sits

down at his desk.

Stefano laughs off the barb and takes a seat as Peggy slips

out.

The two men stare at each other but Stefano's not remotely

intimidated.

Hitch's eyes follow a plume of cigar smoke curling up to the

ceiling...

His gaze remains pointedly fixed on the ceiling.

Hitchcock lowers his gaze, suddenly intrigued.

INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY

Alma sits with the Hitchcocks' ACCOUNTANT who's consulting a

ledger. She sits at her desk in the corner of the kitchen.

The Accountant takes off his glasses, plucking up the courage

to look his favorite client in the eye.

Alma digests this.

INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT

Alma's moved to the kitchen table and is sorting through the

accounts herself, the dogs at her feet. Her face is now

properly filled with concern.

Hitch enters, holding out some typed pages. Alma covers her

worry. He puts the pages on the table next to her.

Alma takes Stefano's pages and starts to read...Hitch goes to

the fridge and opens the door.

He shuts the door. Leans against the fridge door. Hitch waits

but she gives nothing away...until she off-handedly places

the pages on the table...

She doesn't look up...

INT. UNKNOWN ROOM - DAY

Close on a blank page being fed into a Corona typewriter.

FINGERS pound out "PSYCHO"

BY JOSEPH STEFANO.

EXT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE - MORNING

The door opens and Hitchs step outside. The Cadillac is

waiting.

Alma follows him out and makes a final adjustment to his tie.

INT. PRODUCTION CODE ADMINISTRATION OFFICE - DAY

The intimidating plaque for the MPAA's "PRODUCTION CODE

ADMINISTRATION OFFICE" on the wall.

Stefano's TITLE PAGE is tapped angrily by GEOFFREY SHURLOCK,

70s, the much-feared administrator for the Motion Picture

Production Code. He sits at the head of a big table with TWO

ASSISTANTS. Sitting opposite are Hitchcock, Peggy and several

silent PARAMOUNT EXECUTIVES.

Shurlock makes a note. A man utterly devoid of any sense of

humor.

Hitch greets the suggestion with barely concealed contempt.

Shurlock turns the page.

Hitch turns to Peggy and a Paramount Executive.

No response from Shurlock's end of the room. Peggy stares

down at the table.

Hitchcock gives a slow but meaningful shrug.

boiling with rage as we hear the flurry of script pages --

INT. PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE, BEVERLY HILLS - DAY

Sunlight filters through sheer curtains revealing Hitchcock

trying his best to recline on an ANALYST'S COUCH.

He looks around the luxurious office.

Hitch fumbles for a handkerchief and mops his brow.

Now Hitch claws at his tie. It's hot in here.

The analyst's MONTBLANC pen makes a note on a pad. We notice

that his hands are surprisingly coarse.

Finally Hitchcock is still. He stares up at the ceiling.

INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT

A FRIDGE DOOR SNAPS OPEN to reveal Hitchcock's FACE in the

darkness. He's in his pajamas. His hand trembles next to a

stack of chicken breasts and moves to an upturned GRAPEFRUIT

HALF at the back of the shelf.

He pulls it out it to reveal a hidden stash of foie gras

under the hollowed out grapefruit.

He's about to devour it when he catches sight of his

DISTORTED REFLECTION in the chrome shelving.

He backs away, disgusted at this monster before him, the

light of the fridge illuminating his expression.

INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, STUDY - NIGHT

A door is quietly shut and locked. The bottom drawer of a

filing cabinet is inched open. A hand rummages deep inside

and teases out a bulging MANILA FOLDER. A hidden stash of

some kind.

The DESK LIGHT is switched on revealing HITCH. He carefully

extracts the contents of the folder and lays them onto the

desk.

A MASS OF PHOTOS OF ALL HIS BLONDE LEADING LADIES

A personal collection lovingly kept. He settles in to study

it, picking out his favorites, arranging them in order.

They're all in the same pose, all with hair pinned up into a

perfect bun.

He looks at each image with intensifying desire. He's created

all of them. Every detail.

But it's no longer enough...

THE ROW OF GLOSSY PERFECT BLONDES

INT. HITCHCOCK'S OFFICE, PARAMOUNT - SAME TIME

A row of HANDSOME ACTOR HEADSHOTS on a table. HITCH glares at

the waiting ACTORS in the hallway through the blinds. He

turns back to Peggy and Alma and pulls a face.

Hitch returns to the table to ponder yet more headshots.

Peggy shares a glance with Alma, then slides over RODDY

MCDOWELL'S HEADSHOT.

Hitch ignores the barb. Undeterred, Alma pushes her ace card:

a photo of ANTHONY PERKINS, radiating offbeat sensitivity and

teen idol looks.

She raises her pinky finger just slightly. Alma nods without

judgement.

Pondering...

INT. HITCHCOCK'S OFFICE, PARAMOUNT - NEXT DAY

Anthony Perkins now sits across from Hitchcock.

Hitchcock's deeply-felt remark lands with Perkins.

Hitch's calmness is strangely reassuring to the young

actor...

Hitch is enthralled.

Perkins wishes he could be more reassured...

On Perkins uncertain expression -- what is he letting himself

in for?

EXT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, GARDEN - DAY

Hitchcock's RED SWEATING FACE as he grunts and heaves. He's

dressed in gardening gear, laboring in the full bloom of the

rose garden. Alma pushes a WHEELBARROW filled with manure.

She shovels the manure around the rosebushes.

He holds his PRUNING SHEARS menacingly over a deep red

Sydonie rose.

Hitchcock beheads the ROSE, muttering to himself.

His shears are now poised over a yellow specimen.

Hitchcock cuts it too and moves on to the stem of a perfect

pink rose.

As the shears hover on the stem, unsure whether to cut...

INT. CHASEN'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT

THE SLENDER WAIST AND AMPLE BOSOM OF JANET LEIGH as she

elegantly enters the dining room of Chasen's.

Hitch stands to greet her, his eyes follow her across the

room in some private rapture..

Alma watches as Janet removes her glove and shakes Hitch's

hand...before he guides her to the spot to his left, across

from Alma.

INT. CHASEN'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Hitch finishes telling his story...

He's so deadpan... it takes a moment before she laughs.

Hitch summons the waiter with a snap.

Alma watches all this with a fixed smile.

Hitchcock ignores Alma, gesturing to the waiter again.

He pointedly shifts to face Janet.

Janet hesitates.

She turns to pull a LEATHER NOTEBOOK from her handbag,

Hitch's gaze locks onto her silken blonde hair, tied

immaculately into the classic `Hitchcock bun'.

A quick look to Alma, as if to ask for permission before :

She notices Alma's expression.

Hitchcock looks down at her torso, as if noting it for the

first time.

Alma reacts as Hitch reaches over and gives Janet's hand a

reassuring squeeze.

Hitch pulls out his folio case and shows Janet the

storyboards (which we don't see).

Janet studies them, deeply impressed. And relieved.

Alma's had enough. Janet's smile falters as she watches Alma

get up and head to the restroom. She's unsure of what just

happened but Hitch carries on regardless, either entirely

oblivious or not caring at all...

INT. CHASEN'S RESTAURANT, LADIES ROOM - NIGHT

Alma enters and looks in the mirror, quietly devastated. She

looks up to find another reflection in a mirror behind her.

FULL LENGTH MIRROR

Alma is SUDDENLY TRANSFORMED into a Technicolor Hitchcock

blonde. In a beautiful Edith Head gown, her skin is velvet

perfection, her hair blonde and impeccable.

A bitchy STUDIO HEAD'S WIFE snaps Alma out of her reverie,

joining her at the sink to powder her face.

She's had a drink too many but the throwaway comment still

hits Alma hard.

EXT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, GARDEN - DAY

PERFECT PINK ROSEBUSHES

Like in a Douglas Sirk movie. The same roses that are the

`color' of Janet Leigh. Alma hovers with her secateurs for a

moment and then starts SNIPPING off their heads with a

Caligula-like lack of mercy.

INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, KITCHEN - MORNING

A vase of flowers, none of them pink, in the center of the

table. Hitch STARES into a refrigerator filled with boring

tasteless health-conscious food.

Alma enters briskly and holds up a handwritten LIST.

She places the list on the table.

Hitch goes over and picks it up, and reads.

She snatches the list out of his hand.

She turns back to him.

She leaves Hitch to resume contemplating the contents of the

fridge...but there's nothing there to satisfy his growling

hunger. He SLAMS the fridge and --

INT. ED GEIN'S HOUSE - DAY

Suddenly we're moving through an empty living room, prowling,

just like in a Hitchcock movie as we hear CLUNKING, then move

over to catch a glimpse of Ed as he drags A WOMAN'S BODY,

feet-first up the stairs. The clunking is from her head on

the steps, which is wrapped in her dress.

INT. ED GEIN'S HOUSE, BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Ed approaches the shower curtain, then yanks it open with a

METALLIC SCREECH. He pushes the body into the tub. Pulls the

dress off her head and drops it on the floor.

We pan to REVEAL HITCHCOCK standing in the corner. He looks

terrified but completely enthralled -- he can't resist

creeping forward for a thorough inspection. Hitch's POV as he

steps closer to the tub and glimpses the woman's blood-

spattered WHITE BRA and GIRDLE.

Suddenly -- FINGERS CLUTCH the rim of the tub.

Hitch recoils but she LURCHES UP and GRABS his throat.

INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, BEDROOM - NIGHT

Hitchcock bolts upright in bed, face beaded with sweat in the

moonlight.

It takes a moment to get his bearings.

Alma stirs in her bed.

But Hitch isn't looking convinced.

EXT. SOUNDSTAGE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY

A sign posted outside the soundstage reads, "PRODUCTION

REHEARSALS 9401. ABSOLUTELY NO VISITORS!" It only makes

passing REPORTERS AND WORKERS more curious.

INT. SOUNDSTAGE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - CONTINUOUS

Inside, it's a hive of quiet purposeful activity. A.D. HILTON

GREEN escorts VERA MILES across the far side of the stage.

She's 30, a classic blonde porcelain beauty in the Grace

Kelly mold.

Hitch sits in his director's chair reading a copy of the

London Times.

But he still watches VERA over the top of his newspaper as

the A.D. leads her through the maze of hazardous cables and

light stands towards the fitting room.

She passes an actor in a HIGHWAY PATROLMAN'S UNIFORM trying

on various sunglasses with the prop master.

Hitch gets up from his chair.

He goes over to specify the correct sunglasses that should be

worn. The Cop puts on the MIRRORED shades. Hitch nods his

approval.

INT. BEVERLY HILLS STORE - DAY

CLOSE ON A RAIL OF SWIMSUITS. Alma browses through them

carefully. They are all perfectly nice, if a little staid.

Her eyes suddenly catch a COLORFUL SWIMSUIT on the end of the

rail. It's striking, even a little risque. She looks at the

price tag. It's insanely expensive.

She turns to go... stops... then impulsively turns back and

grabs it, heading into the changing room and closing the door

behind her.

IN THE DARKNESS

light blasts through A TINY HOLE in the wall. An EYE

positions itself in front of the peephole.

INT. HITCHCOCK'S OFFICE UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY

We hear the VOICES of two women quietly conversing on the

other side.

Strains to get a better view.

THROUGH THE HOLE

We catch teasing glimpses of golden girl Vera Miles stripping

down to bra and panties.

INT. WARDROBE FITTING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

HITCHCOCK'S EYEBALL fills the frame as he peers through the

tiny hole. We reveal Vera with sharp, bohemian costumer RITA

RIGGS, 27, who drapes taupe-colored fabric to Vera's

contours.

Vera laughs dryly at a WIG on a dummy head.

Vera tosses off her shirt.

She unhooks her bra and crosses to hang it on a hook right

near the HOLE where we just saw Hitchcock's eye. His eye is

gone, only darkness from the other side. Vera feels a chill

and instinctively covers her breasts with her arm.

Rita returns with a punitive bra and girdle.

EXT. JANET'S DRESSING ROOM, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY

Hitch knocks at the door.

JANET steps out dressed in a crisp, sexy white shirt and

pencil skirt. She does a twirl for him. The effect is

stunning. Even the stagehands stop to watch.

His picks a tiny piece of lint on her sleeve.

As he escorts her onto the soundstage, Tony comes up to greet

them.

Janet caught that -- she's clearly amused. Tony gives her a

gracious peck on the cheek.

Janet flicks a glance back at Hitch.

Already, Tony can't help feel a little excluded from Hitch

and Janet's little clique. Hitch ushers them across the

soundstage where the crew are assembling.

Vera Miles marches up in her frumpy tweed suit and wig.

She checkmates him with a ravishing smile.

He steers her towards a line of laughing CREW MEMBERS forming

a circle with the rest of the cast.

He takes Janet by the hand, placing her right next to him and

officiously raises his right hand. The cast and crew duly

follow suit, all except for Vera.

WE SEE VERA'S CROSSED FINGERS BEHIND HER BACK

Then tilt up to Janet's look of mock disapproval. Vera pokes

her tongue out.

Everyone cracks up, but Hitchcock's only interested in the

reaction of his new blonde, standing in pride of place, right

beside him.

INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, KITCHEN - SAME TIME

ALMA sits at the desk typing away at the revisions for

"Psycho." -- we see the title page.

A tiny solitary figure with nothing for company but a vase of

wilting flowers...

She pauses, takes off her glasses and pushes aside her

corrections, suddenly fed up with the all the work.

She looks out at the swimming pool, sparkling in the

sunlight... then turns to the expensive-looking SHOPPING BAG

half-open on the side...

We hear a LOUD SPLASH --

EXT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, POOL - DAY

As Alma plunges into the water wearing her striking new

swimsuit. She breaks into a front crawl. Her strokes are

vigorous, surprisingly so.

She drives the length of the pool, her arms slashing through

the water with increasing speed, her feet kicking out with

rising intensity... harder and harder... faster and faster...

INT. SOUNDSTAGE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY

Hitch guides Janet and Tony across the sound stage to the set

of Norman's parlor.

She and Tony laugh. Hitch's eyes light up at this display of

mischief from her.

Tony flinches at Hitch's brusque response.

They arrive at the set wall, where Hitch removes a painting

to reveal the PEEPHOLE.

Janet simply steps up and presses her face to the hole. Hitch

studies her profile, quietly thrilled at her curiosity. Tony

hangs back, watching Hitch watching her...

He takes a quick peek through the hole now too...then puts

the painting carefully back into place over it.

INT. PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE, BEVERLY HILLS - DAY

Hitch lies on his Analyst's couch.

The Analyst circles one of his notes on a pad with his

Montblanc. Again, we notice how rough-hewn his hands are.

Hitch looks over at the unseen analyst and considers him.

He turns back to look out the window.

The Analyst leans forward and we see his dirty, worn-down

fingernails.

REVEAL THE ANALYST

It's ED GEIN. In his Sunday best, his shovel leaning against

the mahogany-paneled wall in the background.

INT. WARDROBE FITTING ROOM, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY

Hitchcock leads Janet to a row of brassieres, all laid out

for inspection. They are all white with recognizable labels:

Berlei, Triumph, Marks & Spencer. He picks out one of them.

They move on to a second row of brassieres - all dark.

He nods, correct. She moves over to a mannequin displaying

the iconic jet black brassiere.

Janet reads the label. It's "Maidenform."

Hitch digests the information and turns to Rita.

As Rita starts to measure Janet's chest, Hitchcock lifts his

hands and `frames' her...

INT. SOUNDSTAGE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY

Close on Hitchcock's FRAMING HANDS as they now travel up to

an open window with blinds half down...

INT. SOUNDSTAGE, BEDROOM SET - LATER

HITCHCOCK'S HANDS have now become THE CAMERA, recording the

scene already underway and now watched by HITCHCOCK, his

DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY and CREW from across the stage...

...the camera moves to Janet and John making out on the bed.

It's serious stuff.

JANET smiles up at John contentedly.

watching from his directing chair. Peggy stands next to him.

EXT. STUDIO GATES, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY

Alma drives the gleaming black Cadillac through the UNIVERSAL

GATES and pulls up to the production office outside the

stage.

EXT. HITCHCOCK OFFICE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY

Alma collects the script pages off the front seat and walks

into the production office just missing Whit as he strolls

back towards the writers building with a couple of pretty

SECRETARIES.

Whit pauses when he spots the Hitchcocks' CADILLAC.

The PRETTIEST ONE stops to make Whit light her cigarette

before catching up with the others.

INT. HITCHCOCK OFFICE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY

Peggy reads the final pages while Alma inspects the

production boards.

As she makes a few more changes to the schedule. Alma turns

to Peggy whose face tightens as she continues reading.

Clearly it's strong stuff.

She puts the pages down.

A candid moment between the two women... but Alma doesn't

answer, just leaves.

EXT. HITCHCOCK OFFICE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY

Alma emerges into the sunshine and looks across at the

soundstage, wondering whether she should go over there...

She turns to see Whit leaning against the Cadillac.

She points to the PSYCHO HOUSE on the ridge.

He looks at her a moment.

He steps closer.

He playfully tugs at her sleeve.

Alma's expression gives away nothing as we pan over to the

WINDOW of the production office and notice the tell-tale BEND

in the blinds.

INT. HITCHCOCK OFFICE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - SAME TIME

Hitch looks out at Whit and Alma through the window, just

like he did with the other couple earlier. Except this little

interaction is far from dull.

But Hitch doesn't move.

INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, FOYER - DAY

ALMA enters the silent, empty house smiling to herself. She

walks through to -

INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY

- and puts the grocery bags down on the counter. She listens.

The house is eerily quiet, until, from behind --

Alma looks up, but doesn't turn round, well used to Hitch's

cryptic ways.

She puts on an apron and gets to work, preparing dinner.

He heads for the liquor cabinet.

Hitchcock stops. Pulls out a CELERY STICK from one of the

bags and bites it.

He takes another BITE, searching her face for some tell-tale

sign of guilt.

She gets to work preparing a salad. Hitch studies the back of

her tiny, vulnerable neck, the delicate sinews and muscles as

they rise and flex.

INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, BEDROOM - NIGHT

Hitch arranges his pillows and settles into bed while Alma

finishes getting ready.

Alma's radar activates but Hitch continues oh-so-

nonchalantly.

He carefully folds his blanket as if wrapping a murder

victim. She's not exactly sure what he's implying but she

knows she doesn't like it.

She turns onto her side away from him. Pulls the blankets

around her, her eyes still WIDE OPEN.

Alma's eyes become HITCHCOCK'S EYES, staring ahead intently.

INT. SOUNDSTAGE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - CAR SCENE - DAY

As he continues, we pull back and see:

THE REAR-PROJECTION SET

Janet emotes for Hitchcock's CAMERA while "driving" a PARTIAL

CAR, being rocked by STAGE HANDS.

Peggy and other CREW time and mark the takes. ELECTRICIANS

AND GAFFERS turn mounted lamps that rake across Janet's

worried face like car headlights.

He wipes his brow, getting more intense...

SUDDENLY THE REAR SCREEN film breaks and a frame burns.

It's a good thing because Janet is starting to look a little

uncomfortable -- was that meant to be funny? As technicians

yell and hustle, Hitchcock turns to Peggy --

INT. JANET LEIGH'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY

As Janet gets changed, Vera hangs up her frumpy coat on a

rack, looking over a little enviously at Janet's good

girl/bad girl underwear hanging nearby.

Janet finds this a little hard to believe. Vera leans in,

lowering her voice.

That may well be true but it doesn't bother Janet.

They both turn, sensing something -- and see HITCHCOCK'S

DISTINCTIVE SHADOW PROFILE in the hallway. The shadow

lingers, then recedes like in a scary ghost story.

They laugh nervously.

INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

Alma comes in from her gardening, and settles on the sofa

with a cup of tea, a circled copy of TV Guide next to her.

On television -- the 1950 Hitchcock classic Stage Fright.

The credits come up: "Screenplay by Whitfield Cook,

Adaptation by Alma Reville."

Alma watches, thrilled at the sight of her name and Whit's

together.

ON THE TV

The words "DIRECTED BY ALFRED HITCHCOCK" overwhelm the small

screen. Alms puts down her fork, no longer hungry.

INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, HALLWAY - DAY

ALMA heads back to the kitchen, only to pause at the open

door to Hitch's study -- there's something on the desk.

INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, STUDY - CONTINUOUS

THE HITCHCOCK BLONDES

Hitch's personal collection. Alma enters and starts to go

through them. Each photo is turned over a little more roughly

than the last. It's hard to tell whether she's more angry at

the photos or the fact that they've been deliberately left

for her to find...

Alma takes off an earring, picks up the phone and starts to

dial...

INT. SOUNDSTAGE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - SAME TIME

As the crew prepares the car set to go again, Hitch strides

over to PEGGY who's dialing a phone.

He takes the phone himself just as Vera Miles emerges from

her dressing room, script in hand.

He turns his back on her and dials. The ENGAGED TONE blares

in his ear. His eyes narrow at some crew members fussing with

bits of LIGHT and SOUND EQUIPMENT.

He rushes off to fix it. Off Peggy's questioning look.

He raps the receiver button, more intensely this time, and

redials.

INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, STUDY - DAY

But Alma's still on the phone to Whit, basking in his charm.

Her feet are up. There's a drink in her hand.

She hangs up, toying with her earring, feeling better already

when the PHONE rings again very quickly. She picks up without

even thinking --

INT. SOUNDSTAGE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - CONTINUOUS

Pudgy fingers clench the coiled PHONE CORD as we move up to

Hitch's face. He's silent as a burglar, not even daring to

breathe...

The blood drains from Hitch's face as he very slowly and

carefully replaces the receiver. His mind starts to spin.

He's got to get out of there...

CROSSING THE STAGE

Hitch lurches towards the production office, starting to

sweat, but his path is blocked by GRIPS laying cables. The

set is suddenly a cacophony of noise and chaos.

A PR FLACK appears --

Hitch brushes past him to find another route but more grips

are moving a ladder. He turns, kicks a platter of healthy

snacks out of the way, only for an ARCLIGHT to swivel in his

face and blind him.

Peggy's face suddenly comes into focus.

He snatches it and pushes past her, leaving her flat.

EXT. SOUNDSTAGE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY - CONTINUOUS

HITCH exits the soundstage doors, only to find the humorless

face of BARNEY BALABAN blocking his office door.

Balaban offers up his handkerchief. Hitchcock waves it away

even though he's now covered in sweat.

He slams the door in Balaban's startled face.

INT. HITCHCOCK'S OFFICE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - CONTINUOUS

Hitchcock loosens his collar and catches a glimpse of himself

in a mirror. He's unraveling and it shows.

Hitch lowers the window blinds over Balaban's face and

fumbles for the phone.

He takes the key and opens the liquor cabinet ignoring the

INSISTENT KNOCKING at the door --

He pours himself five fingers of scotch.

EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - DAY

A majestic view of the coastline as Whitfield Cook's Cream

MERCEDES 190CL, zooms along, top down. Alma wears white-

rimmed sunglasses and a head scarf.

Whitfield, in true Hitchcock leading man style, has the

perfect amount of wind blowing through his hair.

She takes in the sparkling scenery whipping past.

Whit just smiles as he jams the acceleration and the car

ROARS off down the highway.

EXT. HITCHCOCK'S OFFICE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY

Hitch stands in the parking lot tapping his foot impatiently

near the parked Ford Fairlaine police car used in `PSYCHO'.

Janet watches him, sitting behind the wheel of her VOLKSWAGEN

BEETLE. After a moment she toots her horn and drives up.

She smiles.

Hitchcock raises an eyebrow at the tiny car, and then, with

great effort inches his massive frame through the open door.

INT. CAR - MOVING - DAY

She turns to see Hitch wedged uncomfortably into his seat.

She notices him eyeing the half-eaten bag of CANDY CORN on

the dashboard (the kind Norman Bates enjoys throughout

"Psycho".)

He takes one and chews it curiously.

He takes the whole bag and sets to work, popping them in one

after the other.

He's so deadpan but now there's no way to tell if he's joking

or not. She puts the car into gear, sensing his despair.

EXT. SANTA BARBARA BEACH - DAY

TWO PAIRS OF FEET

nesting in the sand. Alma and Whit sit out watching the surf.

The water laps over their toes.

Whit watches as she picks up some sand, lets it run through

her fingers...

He nods to a SMALL BEACH HOUSE up the way.

She looks at him askance. Is he joking?

EXT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE - DAY

The sun is setting on the Hitchcocks' driveway. The VW pulls

to a stop in front of the front door.

INSIDE THE CAR

Janet looks over -- decides to risk it.

He stops chewing. We push in as his features turn reflective.

He screws up the empty bag of candy and looks over at Janet.

Then, almost like a child --

As she looks across and sees the lonely abandoned little boy

just sitting there...

EXT. SANTA BARBARA BEACH - SUNSET

Alma enters the beach house cautiously and looks around. It

is old and falling apart with only a few functional

furnishings.

Alma looks. The door is partially open -- she sees the one

conspicuously new item of furniture. A double bed.

He gives her a rakish grin, then pushes the door open further

to reveal the deck beyond.

TWO MAUVE CORONA TYPEWRITERS

Sit on a table facing each other.

She lets this sink in, entranced by the incredible view and

the crashing surf.

Then, she steps out onto the deck and up to one of the

typewriters. Gives the key an approving TAP.

INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, FOYER - DAY

Hitch enters the empty house at dusk. The dogs greet him. He

listens a moment... then walks through to the study.

INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, STUDY - CONTINUOUS

Hitch pours himself a brandy and downs it in one. He goes to

pour himself a second, when he notices something on the desk.

It's his collection of PHOTOS by the TELEPHONE. They're all

neatly stacked.

With a SINGLE GOLD EARRING on top.

INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, BEDROOM - NIGHT

Hitch lies in bed, his thoughts racing as he waits for Alma

to come home.

Finally, the sound of the car comes up the driveway.

He turns onto his side and pulls up the blankets, listening

to the sound of the front door ... and Alma's footsteps down

the hall.

She quietly slips into the bathroom and shuts the door before

turning the light on. He watches her shadow through the strip

of light at the bottom of door.

When the bathroom light switches off again Hitch hurriedly

closes his eyes.

Alma emerges in her nightgown and stops at his bedside,

peering down on him. She's not completely sure that he's

actually awake, but she suspects.

INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, BEDROOM - NIGHT (LATER)

Hitch eases himself up and looms over Alma to make sure she

is safely asleep.

He silently picks up her HANDBAG and takes it to the window.

Using the moonlight he searches its contents. Car keys.

Lipstick. Purse.

And the first few pages of a story outline:

"TAXI TO DUBROVNIK"

The pages vibrate in his hand as his gaze lowers to reveal

the rest of the TITLE PAGE: "STORY TREATMENT BY WHITFIELD

COOK & ALMA REVILLE."

INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT (LATER)

A GLISTENING MOUND OF FOIE GRAS spooned into Hitchcock's

mouth straight from the MAXIM'S OF PARIS tin. Hitch stands in

the glare of the open fridge, a beast feeding in its cave,

shoving in mouthful after mouthful. It's almost pornographic

in its indulgence.

GEIN steps out of the shadows and puts a comforting hand on

Hitch's shoulder.

We hear the civilized CLINK of cutlery against china...

INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, DINING ROOM - DAY

Hitch and Alma sit at the table having lunch. Alma eats a

pork chop while Hitch defiantly nibbles at his healthy salad.

He has a nice big glass of red wine which Alma ignores.

Alma blinks, unable to hide her shock.

He picks up a radish and bites into it.

Alma is entirely stunned. Hitchcock has delivered the killer

blow he intended. He gets up and goes over to the garden

door.

As he steps out into the garden --

EXT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, GARDEN - CONTINUOUS

Hitch searches his pockets for his lighter but can't find it.

His annoyance only increases when he notices the SCATTERED

LEAVES `contaminating` the surface of the pool.

He grabs the net and starts scooping them out.

He can't get the net into the inflow filter so he gets down

on his hands and knees and starts PULLING OUT the leaves with

his hands.

watches from the window... then turns away.

Pulls out handful after handful of wet leaves, clawing away

at them like a madman...

A TEMPERATURE DIAL INCHES INTO THE RED

INT. SOUNDSTAGE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - SET

Stage hands and engineers test a row of HOT WATER TANKS

installed on the set.

WE FOLLOW the sound of rushing water through a PIPE as it

snakes across the set floor and passes through a fake wall to

A SHOWER HEAD

Unleashing a stream of STEAMING HOT WATER. The SET HAND gives

the thumbs up.

INT. SOUNDSTAGE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY

Peggy and A.D. Hilton Green exchange a glance as Hitchcock

paces up and down in the corridor, eager to get to work.

Peggy nervously knocks on Janet's door and peers inside --

INT. JANET LEIGH'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY

Rita Riggs is hard at work molding MOLESKIN PATCHES to

Janet's nipples.

Neither woman looks convinced but they proceed with blind

faith.

As Janet slips on her robe, a MOLESKIN TRIANGLE PLOPS onto

the floor. Rita and Janet share a worried look.

EXT. BEACH HOUSE, SANTA BARBARA - DAY

Alma sits at her typewriter while Whit stares off, looking a

little uncertain.

Alma ponders the problem. Finally --

She gets to her feet and starts to pace...

The soothing sound of the ocean gives way to the relentless

HISS of SHOWER WATER --

INT. SOUNDSTAGE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - MOTEL SHOWER SET - DAY

Janet nervously removes her bathrobe and heads toward the

MOCK SHOWER STALL.

He takes her hand and guides her into position.

Around them, the crew frantically finalize the CAMERA and

LIGHT SETUPS. MALE CREW MEMBERS look uncomfortable and

excited by the unprecedented sight of a virtually nude movie

star.

Saul Bass comes over with his boards and Hitch and he discuss

the planned shot a moment.

Into frame steps Anthony Perkins' FEMALE STUNT DOUBLE, MARGO,

wearing a gingham dress, silver wig and BLACK MAKEUP TO MASK

HER FACE. She wields a large PROP KNIFE and almost blocks our

view of Janet in the white-tiled stall.

Hitchcock takes Janet's hand, and with tremendous sincerity :

Over and over, Margo attacks with the knife and Janet tries

deflecting the blows but both women are timid and Janet is

clearly guarding her modesty and covering her body.

Margo's KNIFE comes at Janet uncertainly and every which way.

Naked and exposed, Janet defends against the knife blows as

they come at her but Margo's still pulling her punches--

He charges over to Margo to demonstrate the savage stabbing

gesture he demands.

Everyone falls silent, unsure how to respond. Hitchcock HOLDS

OUT HIS HAND.

Margo places the knife in Hitchcock's palm.

A FEMALE MAKEUP ASSISTANT squirts more CHOCOLATE SYRUP

"blood" onto Janet from a PLASTIC BOTTLE OF BOSCO.

As the scene is marked, we see Hitchcock's anxiety. There is

NO SOUND except Hitchcock's ragged breathing.

Hitchcock nods. The camera whirs. Hitchcock hoists the knife

into the air with terrifyingly convincing power and

malevolence.

THE SHOWER CURTAIN GETS YANKED BACK --

We see in the shower from Hitchcock's POV not Janet but

GEOFFREY SHURLOCK. Hitchcock SLASHES the censor a killer blow

that sends him reeling.

THE SHOWER CURTAIN GETS YANKED BACK AGAIN --

Shurlock is replaced by BARNEY BALABAN. Hitchcock stabs him

with unleashed fury and hate.

THE SHOWER CURTAIN GETS YANKED BACK AGAIN --

WHIT turns, he's naked and smiling. Hitch plunges the knife

into his back, and he drops, revealing ALMA, arms around his

waist.

THE SHOWER CURTAIN GETS YANKED BACK AGAIN --

We're back in the real moment -- JANET LEIGH SCREAMING as she

gives the `performance' of a lifetime.

Hitchcock stops stabbing. His heart pounds. He's soaked with

sweat. The only sound is the drip-drip-drip of the shower...

As he realizes EVERYONE is staring at him. He straightens his

tie, attempting to regain some semblance of control.

He exits quickly.

Rita escorts the shaken and exhausted Janet off set, passing

Vera who's witnessed the whole thing. She's wearing a

bathrobe. Janet gives her a look as if to say `Now I

understand.'

INT. HITCHCOCK'S OFFICE - UNIVERSAL REVUE - CONTINUOUS

Hitch shuts his office door and leans back against it. He

closes his eyes, nauseated and dizzy. He doesn't even need to

open them to know who's there, waiting for him.

He staggers towards the water cooler, fumbling for a cup.

Ed steps forward and pours him some water, pats his shoulder.

But before Hitch can drink it he crashes to the floor.

EXT. HITCHCOCK'S OFFICE - UNIVERSAL REVUE - SAME TIME

Peggy and Perkins to react to the noise...

HITCHCOCK'S OFFICE - UNIVERSAL REVUE - SAME TIME

They come through the door to see Hitch lying on the floor.

He looks like he's dead.

Peggy rushes forward to help. Perkins just stands and stares,

as if paralysed in some Freudian nightmare.

starts to ring.

EXT. BEACH HOUSE, SANTA BARBARA - DAY

It is inside the beach house, and partially drowned out by

the sound of the crashing waves. Alma and Whit are on the

deck, acting out the scene as they write, too engrossed to

notice.

Alma demonstrates so that their hands touch.

They stare into each other's eyes, lips just inches apart...

Finally, the phone intrudes.

With some effort, Whit goes inside and picks it up.

He comes outside, holding out the receiver for Alma.

INT. HITCHCOCK'S OFFICE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY

Peggy grips the phone, her face full of concern.

Hitch lies slumped on the floor. A compress over his

forehead. His head lolls to one side as he slips in and out

of consciousness...

INT. SOUNDSTAGE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY

Disarray on the set.

MARTIN BALSAM watches as SAUL BASS, cameraman JACK RUSSELL

and A.D. HILTON GREEN argue about the best way to proceed

with the staircase sequence. Hitch is conspicuous by his

absence.

As they bicker we find Tony Perkins off to one side, sitting

in his Mrs. Bates costume, unable to cope. He puts the wig

back on his head. There, that feels better...

Balsam's finally had it with all the arguing. He walks off

past Peggy who's arriving with the PHONE.

Peggy hands Hilton the phone.

She gives him a warning look. "Watch out. He's in a terrible

mood." He waves away her concern. It can't be that bad.

INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, BEDROOM - SAME TIME

Hitch, in bed and sick as a dog, has the script, notes and

boards on a bed tray. The phone receiver is pressed to his

ears.

Hitch slams down the phone.

INT. SOUNDSTAGE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - CONTINUOUS

Still clutching the phone, a little nonplussed. Peggy gives

him a look: "What did I tell you."

INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, BEDROOM - SAME TIME

Alma removes the phone from Hitch's grasp. Touches his

forehead.

Hitch swings his legs out of the bed.

He shakily tries to get to his feet.

She pushes him back against the pillows. He's too weak to

resist.

INT. SOUNDSTAGE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY

Crew members sit around eating donuts. Assistant director

Hilton Green and cameraman Jack Russell are still arguing

over the mechanics of the shot with more crew members joining

in. It's near pandemonium.

Then Alma steps in the door, and everything stops. Every crew

member snaps to attention as Alma passes by. It's like the

school principal arriving after the substitute teacher has

lost control.

Alma takes a seat in Hitch's DIRECTOR'S chair. As her eyes

dart around the set, it's clear that she IS TAKING EVERYTHING

IN. Peggy flanks her.

Peggy hands the boards to Alma. She and Hilton quickly review

the boards.

Hilton looks at Russell. Perfect. He sets ANTHONY PERKINS in

his dress into place.

Peggy mouths Alma a silent "THANK YOU" for restoring order.

INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, BEDROOM - DAY

Hitchcock lies in bed, tossing and turning, the fever only

making his thoughts darker and more obsessive.

Hitch notices the SHADOWY FIGURE standing at the end of his

bed.

He blearily sits up and sees Gein's impassive rustic face.

Gein steps over to the bathroom and pushes open the door.

INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Hitchcock enters the immaculate white and chrome room and

inspects it... but nothing seems out of place.

He looks down but again, nothing.

Hitch gets down on his hands and knees. He runs his

fingertips across the smooth white tiles. They start to

GRAINS OF SAND

Sprinkled all over the floor.

Hitchcock's face hardens. His lip trembles.

Hitch gets up, opens the medicine cabinet and takes out a

BOTTLE OF BAYER ASPIRIN.

He empties the tablets into the sink and very carefully,

sweeps the SAND into the aspirin bottle. He caps it, slips it

into his robe pocket and turns off the light.

INT. SOUNDSTAGE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - SAME TIME

Alma spots the towering figure of Balaban stride onto the

stage accompanied by a MAN in a cardigan.

He sees her and bristles, clearly surprised to see her there.

Alma takes in Balaban's companion, and the viewfinder round

his neck.

She does. They nod politely -- then stand there.

Silence. Just the bustle of crew members in the background.

He takes a step towards Hitch's empty chair, but Alma moves

to block his path. It may be a small gesture, but it's highly

charged.

Barney stares down at her.

She moves closer to him, holding his gaze, not bending one

bit...

The anger flashes on his face as she faces him down, the

entire crew behind her now, holding firm...

EXT. SOUNDSTAGE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY

Balaban, incensed, leaves the stage with Kirkpatrick. Alma

steps out into the sunlight not far behind them. As she

watches them leave, she lets out a breath.

A voice calls out to her --

She turns to see Janet walking over in Capri pants and a

sleeveless top. She's carrying an elegantly wrapped package.

She hands Alma the gift. A bag of candy corn tied with a

ribbon.

Alma takes in Janet's unaffected natural beauty -- and her

sincerity.

She can't help but notice the second glances Janet is

provoking from passers-by now...

She's an impossible rival for any woman.

BEETHOVEN'S 3RD SYMPHONY, `EROICA'

Blares deafeningly...

INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, BEDROOM - DAY

On the stereo. Alma finds Hitch on the sofa swaddled in a

blanket and eating ICE CREAM.

She silences the stereo. Hitch doesn't react.

He still doesn't look at her, masticating loudly.

She pulls at the bowl of ice cream. He refuses to let go.

She yanks it from his grip.

He slowly pulls the ASPIRIN BOTTLE from his robe pocket,

building suspense as he unscrews the lid and pours SAND into

a tiny pile on the coffee table in front of him.

He puts down the bottle, looking for a reaction.

She reaches for the ASPIRIN BOTTLE to throw it away but Hitch

grabs it first --

He quivers, livid.

Alma's eyes flash with unaccustomed hurt and fury.

Hitchcock is stunned and silent.

She turns and, with great dignity, leaves Hitchcock sitting

in the gathering gloom. He's not the only one who can deliver

a killer blow.

INT. SOUNDSTAGE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY

with that same lost expression on his face, only now dark

shadow and harsh light alternate across his features.

A NAKED LIGHT BULB dangles from the ceiling as STAGE HANDS

prepare the film's climactic scene in the cellar.

Hitch watches as VERA reaches out to touch the shoulder of

Mrs. Bates. We zoom in on her as she reacts in silent horror,

her HAND flying up to hit the light bulb, throwing crazy

shadows all over the set.

We push in on Hitchcock's face as the strobing light briefly

illuminates the image of -

A SMALL BOY

at the foot of his mother's bed.

INT. VERA MILES' DRESSING ROOM - LATER

A WIG on a stand. A frumpy woman's outfit on a hangar. Vera

sits in front of the mirror and unties her own hair.

Rita collects Vera's detested wardrobe to take back to

wardrobe.

Vera rubs cold cream into her face to remove her make-up. In

the mirror, she sees Hitch in the doorway as Rita squeezes

past him on her way out.

She gives him a dazzlingly ambiguous Miss America smile.

Hitch comes and stands behind her chair, gazing at her in the

mirror.

She considers the question and the man asking it, sensing

something different about him now. She continues wiping off

her make-up.

He studies her a moment.

Hitch gives a very slight bow, touches her on the shoulder,

then leaves. Vera watches him go, struck by his rare show of

vulnerability.

EXT. BEACH HOUSE, SANTA BARBARA - DAY

Wind blows sand off the dunes. Alma sits in the parked car

outside the beach house, contemplating the typed pages on the

seat next to her. An inkling that they may not be as magical

as she had hoped.

No matter. She checks her reflection in the rearview and

applies some lipstick, readying herself.

She collects the pages and heads up the steps to the deck.

She sees two typewriters and paper, but no sign of Whit.

Something doesn't feel right.

She turns and in the bedroom, through the window, she sees

Whitfield Cook making love to a young woman -- it is the

pretty SECRETARY from the studio lot. Alma and Whit's eyes

meet. Whit is horrified at being caught.

Alma ducks her head, wheels around in shock.

She yanks open the door and gets in. Whit runs half dressed

from the house...

She struggles to get the key in the ignition. He puts his

hand desperately on the car door.

Whit smiles feebly.

Alma tries to hide what a body blow this is.

She starts the car and drives off.

Whit watches, deflated, knowing he's ruined everything, his

receding figure swallowed up by flickering white light...

INT. SCREENING ROOM, PARAMOUNT STUDIOS - DAY

WE PLAY THIS SCENE ONLY OVER THE FACES OF A SMALL INVITED

AUDIENCE -- THEIR EXPRESSIONS TELL US THAT THE FOOTAGE THEY

ARE SEEING IS NOT GOING OVER WELL. NOT AT ALL.

Lew sits with Barney Balaban and two executives. Lew

discreetly checks his watch out of boredom. Shurlock and his

two Assistants look appalled. Composer BERNARD HERRMANN, late

40s, prickly, sits in the back row looking suicidal. He

glances back at Hitchcock who stands near the screening room

door looking worse, if that could be possible.

EXT. SCREENING ROOM, PARAMOUNT STUDIOS - LATER

Shurlock exits and approaches Hitchcock who's waiting in the

foyer.

Hitchcock is livid but holds his tongue.

But Shurlock is already walking away...

Wasserman emerges from the screening room conversing with

BALABAN. Hitch searches their expressions for some indication

but Balaban strides off without saying a single word to him.

The harsh reality devastates Hitchcock.

Hitch just stands there.

Still, Hitch doesn't say a word.

Hitch stares bleakly off. He can't help noticing the KIM

NOVAK-TYPE he spied on earlier outside, hand in hand and

kissing her date.

INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY

Alma sits with the Hitchcocks' ACCOUNTANT going over the

books again, looking at the revised figures. They close the

books and sit back and look at each other.

Silence. This time he can't bring himself to look her in the

eye.

Alma gets up and crosses to the window. Stares out at the

pool reflecting a leaden sky... and the clumps of dead leaves

floating across its surface...

INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, STUDY - NIGHT

The dogs, GEOFFREY and STANLEY, lap away at a water bowl in

the study. A splash or two of something is added to the bowl

from above. It's being poured from Hitch's brandy glass.

pours himself another glass, leaving the dogs lapping happily

away as he goes over to the Steinway Grand. There's a bank of

silver-framed PHOTOS on top. He pauses to take a proper look

at them.

His and Alma's life together in movies. Smiling at Premieres

with Cary Grant and Grace Kelly. On vacation with Jimmy and

Gloria Stewart. At a black tie event with Ingrid Bergman and

Gregory Peck.

But it's the PHOTOGRAPH tucked away at the back that he wants

to see most.

A BLACK AND WHITE PUBLICITY STILL taken on the set of The

Mountain Eagle in 1926. He picks it up and looks at it:

The young Hitchcock in front of the camera, dramatically

calling "Action!" on his first film. His eyes don't have to

move far to find ALMA, standing just behind him, making notes

on her clipboard, the same intense, serious look on her face.

They look so young...

Hitch turns to look out the window, thoughtful -- Hitch's

POV. It's SNOWING outside.

INT. GEIN HOUSE, BASEMENT - NIGHT

We pull back to discover the window is now in a basement lit

by a single oil lamp.

We find Gein sitting at his workbench. Hitchcock is perched

on a stool nearby watching him.

Trash and newspapers are piled everywhere. There is grime and

dark stains on the cabinets and counters.

Hitch watches Gein as he threads a needle, stitching

something expertly together. He notices there's no hint of a

tremble in Gein's hands.

Hitch passes over the shopping bag... then pulls up his coat,

feeling a chill.

HEADLIGHTS SUDDENLY RAKE THE ROOM

As we hear CARS pull up -- a lot of them. The sound of MEN,

shouting. Flashing RED AND BLUE LIGHTS. LOUD KNOCKING at the

FOOTSTEPS thunder above him. DOZENS OF OFFICERS are fanning

out all over the house.

Hitch watches as Gein just sits there and the sound of

SHOCKED reactions and horrified GASPS continue above...

CAR HEADLIGHTS blast through the window and Hitchcock finally

sees the basement room properly for the first time; KNIVES of

all shapes and sizes...JARS OF PRESERVED BODY PARTS...and TWO

SEVERED HANDS, FOLDED IN PRAYER.

FROM UPSTAIRS the sound of splintering wood.

Ed springs to his feet, screaming it out as he BOLTS UPSTAIRS

and the pandemonium continues (o.s.)

WE PUSH IN ON HITCH'S FACE

As the bleak reality of Gein's lair hits him...

It's more profound and horrible than he could ever have

imagined.

A lush ROMANTIC SCORE starts to SWELL, mercifully drowning it

all out...

INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Titles from a dark 1946 romantic melodrama fill the screen.

"THE SECRET HEART"

"SCREENPLAY BY WHITFIELD COOK."

Alma sits watching the afternoon movie alone, brushing the

dogs on the sofa next to her.

ANGLE ON DOORWAY

Hitchcock reads Alma's fragile emotional state and enters. He

sits down beside her and studies the screen for a moment.

Alma nods. They watch for a beat longer.

He indicates the over-ripe dialogue coming from the TV.

Alma takes in his reflective expression, but says nothing.

ALMA turns away.

Hitch sits there bereft in the lonely silence.

He moves closer and takes her hand. Gives it a small squeeze.

She still doesn't move. After a moment Hitch gets to his

feet.

He exits with the dogs padding after him. She turns back to

the screen and more of that stilted, mannered dialogue.

Tears well in her eyes.

EXT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE - NIGHT

A full moon. The ONLY LIGHT from inside the house is the one

in the kitchen.

We glimpse the figure in the window. A corpulent man in

profile, like a Hopper painting.

INT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, KITCHEN - LATER

Hitch sits in his nightgown, pushing some VEGETABLES around

his plate -- his healthy midnight snack.

Alma enters in her robe. Hitch watches her. She goes to the

fridge, opens the PRODUCE DRAWER and from under the brussel

sprouts pulls out a tiny hidden jar of BELUGA CAVIAR.

She gets the crackers, a plate and a spoon and sits down at

the table next to him.

She fixes several crackers, each with an appropriate dollop

of caviar on top, and puts the plate in the middle.

She offers him one of the crackers.

Tentatively, Hitch accepts it.

Hitch remains quiet, delicately consuming his cracker.

Hitch puts the lid back on the caviar.

INT. EDITING ROOM - NEXT DAY

A series of quick shots as the editing room comes to life :

CANS OF FILM ARE BROUGHT IN BY ASSISTANTS, STRIPS OF

CELLULOID ARE PULLED OUT, INSPECTED AND MARKED WITH CHALK

WHILE OTHERS ARE SPLICED TOGETHER.

HITCH and editor GEORGE TOMASINI wait quietly like

schoolboys, while Alma reviews the footage on the Moviola.

Alma gives him a look ...

INT. EDITING ROOM - LATER

FILM HANGS EVERYWHERE IN BINS

FOUR ASSISTANTS are working on MOVIOLAS. Alma and Hitch work

their way down the line, inspecting each new assembly.

TWO PAIRS OF HANDS. Hitchcock's and Alma's. They work like a

pair of twenty-year-olds at a pair of MOVIOLAS cutting the

picture.

ANGLE LOOSENS -- to reveal George Tomasini has dozed off,

exhausted.

INT. EDITING ROOM - NIGHT

Editor GEORGE TOMASINI works at the Moviola, sleeves rolled

up.

INT. EDITING ROOM, CORRIDOR - DAY

Peggy stands with a pestering PR FLACK.

Before Peggy can deny it the argument flares through the

wall.

INT. EDITING ROOM - SAME TIME

Bernard Herrmann is pressing his point hard with Hitchcock.

The PR Flack shares a despairing look with Peggy.

BERNARD HERRMANN'S ICONIC SCORE RISES as

INT. EDITING ROOM - DAY

We move across HITCH, ALMA, TOMASINI and PEGGY'S faces as

they watch the Moviola.

The impact of the music is instant and unimaginably powerful.

They are all moved. Gripped. Stunned.

Hitchcock looks down. Peggy is gripping his arm tightly.

They look at him...

Alma turns to him and Hitch nods slightly. Was that the

tiniest acknowledgement that her instinct may have been

right?

INT. PRODUCTION CODE ADMINISTRATION OFFICE - DAY

ON SHURLOCK'S HUMORLESS FACE

Hitchcock sits opposite him at the big conference table.

Shurlock gestures his staff out. Hitch moves closer.

Shurlock reacts with surprise.

Shurlock is more flattered than he'd care to admit.

Shurlock studies Hitchcock's sphinx-like expression.

INT. SOUNDSTAGE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY

Hitchcock and Peggy confer. John Gavin and Janet Leigh,

wearing robes, chat while lying on a bed. Crew members wait

impatiently. Peggy checks her watch.

Peggy laughs. Now she understands.

The crew starts breaking things down. The actors are baffled.

Janet walks over to him.

Hitch holds out his arm for her and walks her back to the

dressing room.

He offers his hand and she shakes it, determined to be

professional to the end.

She leans in and gives him a peck on the cheek. A moment of

unexpected heaven that leaves Hitch speechless.

She walks away to her dressing room. Hitch watches as she

steps inside and closes the door.

After a moment we hear a PIERCING SCREAM --

INT. JANET LEIGH'S DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Janet recoils at the sight of A MRS. BATES PROTOTYPE "PROP

MASK" grinning lewdly from her chair, and wearing one of

Janet's brassieres.

Hitchcock peeks inside as crew members come running.

She can't believe she's been caught out. She closes the door

on everyone... and then after a moment SCREAMS AGAIN... but

this time not out of shock.

INT. HITCHCOCK'S OFFICE, UNIVERSAL REVUE - DAY

Hitch sweeps in. Lew is waiting for him.

Hitch turns to Lew for the latest news.

Peggy whips out her steno pad.

INT. PRINTING PRESS - DAY

BOOKLETS make the rounds on a conveyor-like contraption. As

the booklets are bound by swift-moving WORKERS, we see

Hitchcock's photo on a cover and his "advice" to theater

owners.

INT. NEW YORK THEATRE - FLASH FORWARD

A MANAGER opens up his PSYCHO PROMOTIONAL HANDBOOK and starts

to read, totally baffled.

INT. NEW YORK THEATRE - FLASH FORWARD

The manager introduces the PINKERTON GUARDS to his equally

bemused STAFF.

He oversees as they hang a ridiculously large PSYCHO CLOCK in

the lobby.

EXT. NEW YORK THEATRE - FLASH FORWARD

Hitch's voice booms from LARGE SPEAKERS MOUNTED UNDER THE

MARQUEE.

We PAN DOWN to the STAFF and GUARDS as they test out the

RECORDED message that will be played for the ticket holders

line. A couple of PASSERSBY listen, perplexed...

INT. HOLLYWOOD RECORDING BOOTH - PRESENT

Hitch lays down the track into a large microphone while Alma

watches from the recording desk.

INT. EMPTY NEW YORK THEATRE - FLASH FORWARD

A row of life-size HITCHCOCK STANDEES are carried in through

the door one by one. Posters are hung in the theatre lobby.

The letters hoisted up and hung on the marquee outside.

Inside the theatre, the manager makes sure the CURTAINS open

and close correctly then turns to face the vast, empty

auditorium.

He anxiously surveys the hundreds of seats that will have to

be filled.

INT. BOARD ROOM, PARAMOUNT STUDIOS - DAY

Now Barney Balaban is reading Hitchcock's publicity manual to

the board.

Balaban shuts the pamphlet. Silence. Then turns to the stone-

faced board members :

He tosses the pamphlet into the trash.

INT. LIMO - DAY

ON HITCH AND ALMA'S SILENT TENSE EXPRESSIONS as they drive

through the frenetic madness that typifies Times Square,

1960.

EXT. NEW YORK THEATRE - DAY (LATER)

A DAZZLING MARQUEE for "ALFRED HITCHCOCK'S PSYCHO." The car

pulls up. Hitch and Alma step out. There's a long line of

people outside the theatre.

But Hitch's nerves are hardly soothed. The people in line

start to notice the Hitchcocks...is it really them?

Comes over to greet them with the THEATRE MANAGER.

As the theatre manager ushers them through the side alley --

Hitchcock turns to Alma.

INT. NEW YORK THEATRE, LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

The atmosphere is tense as people hurry to their seats. Lew

greets them.

Off Alma's look.

Lew escorts Alma and Peggy into the auditorium.

INT. NEW YORK THEATER, PROJECTION BOOTH - NIGHT

The soothing whir of the projector as Hitchcock stands next

to it... but the sound of the audience below TITTERING

NERVOUSLY is anything but reassuring.

He peers down through the tiny window but can't see a bloody

thing.

INT. NEW YORK THEATRE, DOWNSTAIRS LOBBY - A MINUTE LATER

Hitch inches open the door and PEERS THROUGH THE CRACK at the

audience but now he can't read them. Are they gripped with

suspense -- or do they just hate it?

From the lobby we see

as he closes the door and leans back against the wall of the

empty corridor. A scared, lonely, corpulent figure. Totally

powerless.

There's nothing for him to do but wait.

And wait.

And wait.

Across the foyer, a spotty young THEATRE EMPLOYEE sweeps up

ticket stubs and empties ashtrays, quietly going about his

business, entirely oblivious...

ON HITCH'S FACE

As he grips the railing. This is taking far too long.

And then -- finally -- the sweetest sound in the world A

BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM.

Soon the WHOLE AUDIENCE SCREAMS IN TERROR... then breaks into

LAUGHTER again... nervous laughter this time, the best kind.

As he gestures with his hands, a conductor leading his

orchestra, raising them up again as the audience STARTS

SCREAMING AGAIN right on cue

PUSHING TIGHTER ON HITCH

As the dam breaks and all the pent-up emotion floods out...

leaving only relief and satisfaction... and making way for a

smile... the largest of his whole career.

INT. NEW YORK THEATRE - LATER

Hitch, Alma and Peggy are led out into the foyer by the

theatre manager. There are still SCREAMS in the theatre as

the show continues.

Lew can be seen on the phone in the theatre manager's office

in the background as Hitch, Alma and Peggy walk past the line

of ticket buyers to get to the front doors. There is great

excitement now as more and more people recognize the

Hitchcocks...

He gets a laugh. Hitchcock walks alongside the Theater

Manager who's not going to miss out on having his own moment

with the crowd.

Laughter as Lew appears.

The two friends a look.

Hitch playfully shrugs, "we'll see".

The theatre manager ushers them towards the exit doors.

EXT. THEATRE - DAY (LATER)

A few photographers snap Hitch as he emerges and heads past

the line of ticket buyers towards the waiting car. Hitchcock

gestures for Alma to take her place next to him instead of

behind him. She shyly waves him away but eventually, and

appreciatively, relents.

As the flashbulbs start to POP --

He looks into her eyes with nothing but deep, intense

gratitude and joy. As more flashbulbs pop --

He gives her a gentle peck.

He helps her into the car.

INT. CENTRAL STATE HOSPITAL WARD - DAY

It is a utilitarian institutionalized dining room. Several

nonviolent INMATES eat at different round tables around the

room.

An ATTENDANT watches, and an ORDERLY mops the floor (there

are NO female patients nor staff members.)

THE REAL ED GEIN

is at a table with two other patients, including a soft

spoken older man, CHET. Ed is heavier, his hair is whiter,

and he is much more at ease than we've ever seen.

The Attendant pulls the orderly aside, and whispers to him,

nodding toward Ed. The Orderly's jaw drops! It is the coolest

thing he's ever heard. He looks at Ed like he's a movie star.

Meanwhile, Ed yawns, content. Utterly oblivious.

He takes a huge bite blueberry pie.

He takes a long drink of milk.

We pan to discover HITCHCOCK has been watching all this. He

turns to the camera.

He produces a CIGAR and wanders towards the exit doors.

As he strolls through the door --

EXT. HITCHCOCK HOUSE, GARDEN - DAY

-- and seamlessly appears in the beautifully tended gardens,

as if having walked through a portal.

He holds out his cigar towards something we don't yet see...

A SMALL BIRD

Alights on his cigar tip and FLAPS its wings. Hitchcock can't

resist blowing a sadistic plume of smoke at the bird which

promptly flies away. He gives the camera a final

characteristically deadpan look...

The distinctive THEME TUNE to his TV show starts up and Hitch

toddles back up the front lawn and toward the terrace, where

Alma can be seen laying out a delicious healthy lunch...

ALFRED HITCHCOCK MADE SIX MORE MOVIES AFTER PSYCHO. HE DIED

AT HOME IN BEL AIR IN 1980, WITH ALMA BY HIS SIDE. ALMA

HITCHCOCK DIED TWO YEARS LATER.

ED GEIN LIVED IN COMFORT IN MENTAL INSTITUTIONS UNTIL HIS

PEACEFUL DEATH IN 1984.

ALFRED HITCHCOCK NEVER WON AN OSCAR. IN 1979, WHEN HE

ACCEPTED THE AMERICAN FILM INSTITUTE'S LIFE ACHIEVEMENT

AWARD, HE DEDICATED THE HONOR TO HIS WIFE, SAYING, "I SHARE

MY AWARD, AS I HAVE MY LIFE, WITH ALMA."
