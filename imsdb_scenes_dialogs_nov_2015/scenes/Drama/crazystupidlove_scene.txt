Soft music. A classy joint. Below the tables, WE PAN

well-heeled feet nuzzling. Finally we SETTLE ON:

A PAIR OF FEET

WHITE SNEAKERS sitting opposite FANCY HIGH HEELS. These

feet aren't nuzzling. There's distance here.

PULL UP, REVEALING CAL WEAVER (42) and his wife, TRACY

(41). A handsome couple. He'd be JFK to her Jackie O...

if he gave a shit. Unfortunately, he doesn't (i.e.:

white sneakers in fancy French restaurant).

Cal pulls out READING GLASSES, looks at the menu.

Well, I'm full. You were right,

hon. I shouldn't have eaten all

that bread.

Want to just share a dessert?

Tracy is lost in thought, gazing at a menu.

You okay, babe? You seem out of

it.

Yeah, I'm just thinking about what

I want.

Me too. Okay, let's say it at the

same time. One. Two. Three...

I want a divorce. Creme Brulee.

JESSICA (17) chases after MOLLY (9). Jessica's skinny,

wears glasses, a hipster T-shirt. In five years, she's

going to make all the boys' heads spin. But not yet.

2.

I'm gonna getcha! I'm gonna

getcha!

She grabs Molly and tickles her. Molly SQUEALS with

delight. As she kicks... SMASH! A picture falls off the

nearby console. Jessica picks it up:

ON SMASHED PHOTO

Cal and Tracy. This is their house.

BACK TO SCENE

It's okay, my fault.

Alright, kiddo, it's getting late,

let's get you to bed before your

parents get home. Don't give me

the puppy eyes, you little maniac.

Go brush your teeth!

Molly GIGGLES, RUNS upstairs. Once Molly's gone, Jessica

looks at the photo. She eyes Cal affectionately.

Meanwhile, TWO YOUNG PROFESSIONAL WOMEN drink and laugh

at a table. HANNAH (24) is clearly buzzed.

I don't care. I love him and

given the opportunity, I'd have

his babies.

Her best friend, LIZ (29), LAUGHS.

Seriously? Conan O'Brien? You'd

do Conan O'Brien?

I'm just saying, Richard's a lot

of things: successful, smart...

Boring, workaholic, sexually

repressed...

3.

But he's not very funny, that's

all.

Yeah, well, you want funny, go

watch `Cosby' reruns. You want a

good lay, go get yourself some

of... that.

She motions off to the side.

What?

The hot piece that's been checking

you out for the last hour.

THE CROWD PARTS, revealing: JACOB PALMER (32). The

smoothest, coolest son-of-a-bitch you've ever seen. He

tilts his glass at them, toasting.

Meanwhile, Cal sits in the passenger seat, dazed. A "to-

go" box from the French restaurant in his lap. Tracy

drives.

Aren't you going to say anything?

Nothing.

Almost twenty-five years of

marriage, you have nothing to say?

She looks at him. He turns to her, about to say

something, then... stops himself. Turns back forward.

It's silent. Devastating.

CUT BACK TO:

Meanwhile, Jessica (the baby-sitter) stops at a bedroom

door. She hears MUSIC coming from inside, puts her ear

to the door. It's Lady Gaga. It's awful.

She smiles, knocks and opens the door at the same time.

4.

Hey, your sister's asleep, just

checking you're alive --

She SCREAMS as --

ROBBIE WEAVER (13), quickly covers himself up. He was

masturbating.

Close the door!

BACK TO JESSICA

who slams the door shut.

I'm sorry, Robbie! I didn't see

anything, I swear.

BACK INSIDE ROOM

Robbie lies there frozen, horrified.

Meanwhile, where Liz and Hannah keep drinking.

I don't know, Hannah. Your life

is just so... PG-13.

Hannah's mouth drops open.

My life is not PG-13!

It so is. You've never left LA.

You pass the bar you're gonna be,

what, a patent lawyer, probably

married to that snooze-fest

Richard. I just worry about you

is all. Hell, you've resorted to

fantasizing about Conan `Ginger-

Dick' O'Brien.

5.

He's funny.

He looks like a carrot, honey.

Hannah LAUGHS.

VOICE (O.S.)

Who?

They turn. It's Jacob Palmer (the stud from earlier).

Hi.

Hi. Who looks like a carrot?

Conan O'Brien. My friend Hannah

thinks he's sexy.

I think your friend Hannah is

sexy.

Hannah LAUGHS.

You didn't really just say that.

Pretty sure I did.

How old are you?

Thirty-three next month.

Then you should know by now that

cheesy pick-up lines don't work.

Jacob sits down at their table, uninvited.

I find you incredibly sexy. It's

a fact, not a cheesy pick-up line.

6.

There are many attractive women in

this bar -- including your friend

here -- and I've been unable to

take my eyes off you, only you,

for the past two hours. Again:

not a cheesy pick-up line, just a

fact.

Answer this quickly, without

thinking about your answer: do

you find me attractive?

Hannah doesn't flinch.

I don't.

Yes you do.

Yes, she does.

I'm an accomplished lover. If you

come home with me, I am confident

you will leave satisfied.

Multiple times.

You've got to be kiddi--

We'll make love and it will be

amazing. You'll laugh afterwards

and say `I never do this kind of

thing.' Then you'll do it again.

Is that so?

It is. So now I'm going to ask if

I can buy you another drink. If

you say yes, we'll have one more

cocktail each -- just enough to

start losing inhibitions, not

enough to get sloppy, after all:

I promised to satisfy you.

Multiple times.

7.

That's right. So, here we go,

Hannah: can I buy you a drink?

Hannah and Liz share a look.

What do you expect me to say to

that?

Margarita, rocks, salt.

Wow.

She STANDS, grabs her coat and Liz's hand.

Okay, time to go.

Liz doesn't move.

I'll go home with you, you can

call me Hannah, I don't give a

Liz!

(whispering to him)

Another time, maybe.

GIGGLING, the girls leave the bar.

Still driving, Tracy looks at Cal. He remains silent.

I'm unhappy, Cal. I've tried not

to be. We've been married so

long, somewhere we became...

stagnant, you know?

He keeps staring straight ahead.

Okay, you're not talking and you

know that only makes me talk more.

Maybe that's good, maybe that's

good. Okay...

8.

There's this person.

No response.

We've been spending time together.

Lunches, meetings, that kind of

stuff...

Silence. She closes her eyes tightly.

I slept with him. Kind of.

Tracy opens one eye, taking a peek. Nothing.

No, no kind of. I can't believe I

said kind of. That's just not

something you do in a kind of way.

I slept with someone. There. I

said it. I slept with someone.

Oh God. It's the worst thing I've

ever done but it feels so good to

say out loud. I slept with

someone. I SLEPT with someone. I

slept with SOMEONE. I slept with

... please stop me, please say

something.

No reaction.

David Jacobowitz. From work. You

met him at the Christmas party.

You remember that party? They had

the giant paper-mache wreath? I

kept asking the decorator how he

made it? You wore that sweater --

Finally, Cal speaks --

Please stop.

The last person in the world I'd

ever want to hurt was you, Cal --

If you keep talking, I'm going to

get out of the car.

9.

But the fact that I did, that it

could happen at all, I think it

just shows how broken we are and --

Okay.

Just like that, Cal OPENS THE DOOR to the moving car and,

simply, steps out. Tracy SCREAMS as Cal goes flying.

She screeches to a stop as he tumbles to the curb in her

rearview mirror.

Tracy runs to him. He's on the curb, BLOODIED but okay.

Are you out of your mind!?

He looks up at her, pleading.

I'll leave tonight, I'll sign

whatever you want me to sign, if

you'll just stop talking about it.

She touches his bloody forehead, affectionate. There's

still something here.

Okay.

Okay.

He stands, limps back to the car.

Meanwhile, Jessica sits on the living room couch. Robbie

ENTERS, stands there. He's a precocious, adorable,

masturbation-addicted, thirteen-year-old.

I'm sorry that you had to see

that.

She keeps staring straight ahead.

I should have knocked.

10.

Silence. After a long beat.

For the record: I think about you

while I do it --

Robbie!

I have a picture of you and I look

at it the whole time --

Stop it!

I love you, Jessica. And I know

you're seventeen, and I know I

just turned thirteen, which is the

same age as your little brother,

and you're technically my baby-

sitter, but someday soon our age

difference will be inconsequential

which is good because...

I'm pretty sure you're my

soulmate.

She stops, looks at him and smiles gently.

Listen, Robbie --

LIZ (O.S.)

We're home.

Shit.

Jessica jumps off the couch.

Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Weaver. How was

dinner...

Oh my God, Mr. Weaver, you're

bleeding. Why are you bleeding?

11.

Mrs. Weaver told me she wants a

divorce so I jumped out of the

car. Hope the kids behaved. Come

on, I'll drive you home.

Robbie steps INTO FRAME.

Dad?

Oh. I didn't know you were here.

You're getting divorced?

Yes.

Cal!

And you jumped out of a car?

A moving car, yes.

Cal!

I'm sorry you found out this way.

I'm sorry you jumped out of a car.

Thanks.

Jessica, you got your coat?

Uh-huh.

Cal drives now. Jessica in the front. Awkward.

Finally, Cal starts talking to himself. Almost shell-

shocked.

12.

We'll talk to the kids tomorrow.

Tell them we're separating. Just

separating. We'll do it together.

He thinks.

I'll have to tell Nanna. Uch,

she's gonna be crushed. But not

right now. She's got enough to

worry about...

He trails off. Another long beat of silence, then he

remembers his company and turns toward Jessica.

So, I hear Stanford early

admission, huh. I know your dad

is so proud.

Yeah.

You're bleeding real bad, Mr.

Weaver.

She goes to touch his eye. Out of nowhere... he starts

BANGING THE SHIT out of his steering wheel.

David Jacobowitz! Are you kidding

me!? DAVID FUCKING JACOBOWITZ!

GOD DAMN HER!

He calms down, slowly. Pulls up to a DRIVEWAY.

Sorry about that.

It's okay.

Jessica reaches for the door, but stops. She takes a

deep breath, adorable.

Mr. Weaver, I know you don't know

me very well, but I've been baby-

sitting for your family for three

years. You're the nicest dad of

any of the families I baby-sit

for, by a country mile.

13.

You're funny, and you're always

really generous, and you're the

only dad who's excited --

genuinely excited -- to check on

his kids when he gets home from

dinner. Now I like Mrs. Weaver, I

like her a lot, but if she wants

to divorce you, well... then I

think she's batshit crazy.

Cal smiles, distracted but grateful.

In fact -- and, I hope this

doesn't make you uncomfortable --

I think I've even developed a

Hey: do me a favor -- can you not

mention what's going on between

Mrs. Weaver and I to your parents?

It's probably better they hear it

from us. Okay?

Uh-huh.

That's my girl.

Jessica awkwardly gets out of the car.

Hey, Jessica? Thanks for

listening.

She smiles, turns back. She freezes when she sees...

He's holding CASH out the window to pay her.

You put this to that fake ID

you'll need up at Stanford.

And with a sad wink, he drives off -- leaving her

standing there, lovelorn and forty-five dollars richer.

Cal sits at the bar, drinking away his sorrows. He's

disheveled, a bit wobbly. He motions for the BARTENDER.

14.

Another vodka cranberry?

Yes. Just... yes.

A GIRL (30s) approaches the bar. Cal taps her shoulder,

a drunken train-wreck waiting to happen.

Guess what?

What?

My wife is having intercourse with

someone who isn't me.

I'm sorry to hear that.

That's very nice of you to say.

She just told me tonight,

obviously it came as a bit of a

shock and you're not listening

anymore.

The Girl has turned back to a group of friends.

I bet you wouldn't ignore me if I

were David Jacobowitz. My wife

doesn't ignore David Jacobowitz.

(to no one)

She screws him.

Something catches Cal's eye across the bar. We PAN TO...

wearing his two thousand dollar suit, he's now got TWO

BEAUTIFUL WOMEN fawning over him at his table.

Cal takes him in for a long beat, turns back to the

bartender, and decides:

Gay.

15.

You know these places: basically a "strip" of identical

housing units -- usually occupied by newly-divorced dads.

A WOMAN (60s) gives Cal the tour.

So it's pretty no-frills. Unit 2

is a lot like unit 1 except you're

downstairs so... the ground is

closer. Which is nice.

The most depressing, empty, beige place ever.

I guess the price is right.

Yeah, well, tons of divorced guys

here. You'll fit right in.

Cal SIGHS, un-enthused.

I'll take it.

Ooh, the gym has an elliptical

machine... I assume you want to

get back in shape?

Cal looks down, embarrassed.

I guess.

Great! I'll let you know when

they fix it.

Cal sits at his desk, doing paperwork. His BOSS ENTERS.

Cal, I just got the weekly sales

report, good good good! You

really killed this quarter!

16.

Keep it up you're going to be

sitting in my seat by year's end.

Really great, Cal. Seriously.

Who told you Tracy and I were

getting a divorce?

Divorce! That's it. Amy heard

you crying in the bathroom. We

all thought it was cancer. Thank

God.

I have to go buy furniture now.

Cal stands, EXITS.

Go for it!

(then, calling after)

It could have been cancer, buddy!

Cal is sitting on a plain, faux-modern couch. He's

staring into space. A SALESMAN APPROACHES.

Can I help you, sir?

My wife is sleeping with David

Jacobowitz. I need a couch.

Ooh, I understand. Can I give you

a word of advice, one divorced man

to another? If you don't mind?

Sure.

Get the matching chaise, killer

deal.

He pats the adjacent piece. Cal processes this.

I want it in beige.

17.

I'll write you up.

Cal's back at the bar, sipping on his drink. He looks

absolutely exhausted. He looks across the bar.

At his usual table, Jacob is now wooing a NEW WOMAN.

Cal shakes his head, amazed at this guy's chutzpah. A

GUY grabs the open bar stool next to Cal. Cal reacts.

Oh, no, I'm sorry, I'm waiting for

a friend.

You've been holding the seat for

an hour.

Yeah, well, my wife is screwing

David Jacobowitz so eat me.

The guy shrugs, walks away. Cal looks at his watch, puts

a napkin on his drink, and stands.

Cal pees. Jacob steps INTO FRAME in the adjacent urinal.

Cal does a friendly "I'm peeing next to you" nod. Then:

Can't help but notice that you're

always surrounded by women.

Multiple women.

Jacob doesn't even turn.

I'm getting divorced. Or, in the

process. Gonna be single again.

Nothing.

Any advice?

Yeah.

18.

Jacob zips, flushes, turns.

Don't start conversations with

people while they're pissing.

He walks away, washes his hands, EXITS. A beat, then:

So gay.

Cal's a few drinks in now. The door to the bar opens as

BERNIE (late 40s) rushes in. An oak tree of a man. He's

carrying a SHOPPING BAG.

Sorry I'm late, I had to pick

something up from Macy's.

Don't worry about it, here, sit,

I've been guarding this stool with

my life.

Bernie sits, looks uncomfortable.

It's good to see you, man. I've

called you a few times. It's been

a rough couple of days, obviously.

Nothing I could use more than my

old pal Bernie to unload on. Hey,

we should play racquetball, when's

the last time we played

racquetball?

Claire won't let me be friends

with you anymore.

Cal takes this in.

I'm sorry, what?

She said we had to choose between

you and Tracy. I chose you. She

said no.

19.

He pulls a WRAPPED PACKAGE from the bag, hands it to Cal.

It's cologne.

Are you breaking up with me?

Claire's waiting in the car.

Um... there's a gift receipt in

there. Sorry.

Bernie stands, awkwardly. He pats Cal on the shoulder,

lingers a beat too long, then simply turns and EXITS.

Cal is left alone. He raises a finger at the Bartender.

Do you have anything with a worm

in it? Because I'd like a gallon

of that now.

Legs crossed, martini in hand, he's been watching Cal get

dumped this whole time.

He PANS UP from Cal's feet. The white sneakers. Bad

navy blue dress socks. Dad khakis. An ill-fitting,

untucked, dress shirt. Half-lidded eyes. Rumpled hair.

Jacob shakes his head. Jesus Christ. He says something

to THE WOMAN who currently sits at the table. She nods,

gets up and walks away.

BACK TO CAL

As the Bartender pours him a second shot. He's now

showing pictures from his wallet to the Bartender.

This is my youngest, Molly. Her

two favorite things are High

School Musical and her mother. I

hate both of her two favorite

things.

A SHARP WHISTLE interrupts. Cal turns, sees Jacob.

Jacob motions for Cal to come over. Every move Jacob

makes is practiced, perfectly cool.

20.

Cal points at himself: "Me?" Jacob nods: "Yep." Cal

SHRUGS, stands, and wobbles over towards Jacob.

Jacob Palmer.

I'd like to buy you a drink, Cal.

I already have a drink.

Let me buy you a drink, Cal.

Okay.

Jacob motions to the Bartender who NODS. Cal SITS.

My wife is cheating on me with --

David Jacobowitz, yes, Cal, I've

heard. We've all heard. For the

last two nights, I've watched you

batter every poor soul in this bar

with your sad-sack loser sob

story.

Cal takes this in. He STANDS.

You know what, I don't need this

Sit down, Cal.

Okay.

Cal sits. Jacob's that powerful. Cal's that drunk.

21.

Cal, I'm going to make you an

offer, it's probably the best

offer you're ever going to get,

and you're extremely drunk, so

it's wildly important that you

don't answer until I've finished

and you've taken a few moments to

process what I'm saying. Do you

understand?

Cal goes to answer, Jacob holds up a finger. Cal stops

himself. Once he's settled, Jacob continues:

As I said, I've been watching you

for two days now and I can say,

without hesitation, that you are

the sorriest man I've ever seen in

my life -- don't interrupt, Cal,

it's the truth, and you need to

hear it. You're sitting there

with your Supercut haircut,

getting drunk on watered down

vodka-cranberries like a fourteen-

year-old girl, wearing a 41R

jacket when you should be wearing

a 40L -- I don't know if I want to

help you or euthanize you

-- stop drinking out of the

goddamn straw, Cal.

Cal stops drinking from the wimpy red straw.

You asked me for advice before,

Cal, so I'm going to help you. I

don't know why. Maybe I'm just

bored. Maybe all my friends have

abandoned me for wives and

children and labradoodle puppies,

who cares why? Why doesn't

matter. The point is, you've got

a good face, and a good head of

hair, and I'm bored as hell and

need a project. So if you want,

I'm going to help you rediscover

your manhood. Do you remember

when it was that you lost it?

Cal shakes "no."

22.

Doesn't matter, we'll find it.

And when we do, when I'm through

with you, that wife of yours is

going to rue the day she decided

to give up on you too early.

That's my offer. What do you say?

Cal stares at him blankly. A long beat of silence. Cal

goes for a drink, almost uses the straw... then catches

himself. He puts down the drink. Looks up.

Yeah, okay.

Mall food court, Thursday, six

o'clock.

I'm sorry, what?

Jacob downs his drink, nods at THE WOMAN (now nearby).

You ready to go?

She nods, subservient, and follows him out.

Cal shakes his head, picks up his drink, and slurps the

rest of his vodka cranberry out of the straw.

A well-maintained yard, bordered by shrubs and bushes. A

long driveway runs parallel to the yard. A medium-sized

U-HAUL is parked in the driveway.

Cal EXITS the back door, carrying a BOX. He loads it

into the U-haul and takes a last look back at:

A weathered playground sits off to the side. You can

tell it hasn't been used in quite some time. Baseball

equipment lays all over, the site of many father-son

catches. An oft-used barbecue next to the house.

You can tell a lot about this family from seeing this

backyard. You like this family a lot from seeing this

backyard.

23.

TRACY (O.S.)

Cal?

Cal looks up. Tracy approaches. She's wearing sweats.

It's pretty obvious that she's been crying. Awkward

silence. Neither knows what to say.

I just wanted to say that...

Her voice cracks. She turns away.

Shit.

She gathers herself. Cal steps forward. Instinct tells

him to comfort his wife but he can't anymore and he stops

himself. She realizes this. There's something harsh and

complicated about the reality of it all.

Tracy looks at the U-HAUL, wipes her eyes and tries to

lighten things.

Do you want me to back that thing

out of the driveway for you?

I'll be fine.

You have trouble in reverse is

all.

It was two times --

Three if you count my father's

foot.

I did that on purpose.

I knew it.

They smile, in rhythm for a moment. Then they realize,

stop smiling. Cal turns awkwardly.

Once I'm settled, I'll get the

kids so they can see the place.

He walks to the truck. Tracy's voice stops him.

24.

I think I'm have a mid-life crisis

maybe. Can women have mid-life

crisis?

Make sure the lawn gets enough

water.

In the movies it's always men

having them and buying ridiculous

yellow Porsches, but I'm not a man

and I really don't want a yellow

You have to fertilize once a

month. Not twice a month, not

once every two months.

She takes a deep breath, finding her balance.

We got married so young, Cal. And

I'm forty-one. And that's so much

older than I thought I'd be.

The sprinklers turn off behind

you.

And I got really upset with an

umpire at Molly's t-ball game last

month -- like really upset, like I

screamed at him and wished he

would die -- and I started feeling

like the person I promised I

wouldn't turn into, you know?

If it rains a lot, you need to

shut off the automatic setting.

And we haven't been us, not for a

long time. And I don't know when

you and I stopped being `us'

but... I mean, do you?

Cal finally turns and looks at her.

25.

I think it was when you screwed

David Jacobowitz.

Ouch. Tracy's face registers the blow, but she nods:

she also understands it.

Make sure my azaleas get enough

sun.

Cal turns, gets in the U-HAUL, and backs out...

And immediately crashes into the neighboring FENCE.

Cal leads in Molly and Robbie.

Okay, well, this is it. What do

you think? Didn't have a lot of

time to house-hunt, but...

They look around his depressing, beige apartment. A

pathetic TV plays the Disney Channel in the corner.

There's a second bedroom with twin

beds so you two can stay over

whenever you want! Anytime!

So... you're like, actually going

to live here?

Molly looks like she's going to cry.

Hey, hey. Come on now, you'll

visit all the time. Every

weekend. It won't be that bad.

Don't you love us anymore?

Cal takes Molly's face in his hands, starts tearing up.

Listen, baby. What's happening

with your mommy and I... it's not

what either of us wanted, not what

either of us planned.

26.

But you need to understand that

you kids have done nothing wron--

TROY!

She bolts past Cal to the TV, where ZAC EFRON is on-

screen, prancing about in a basketball uniform. Robbie

and Cal stand there, awkwardly.

Don't take it personally. That

show's like crack to her.

Cal NODS.

You okay?

You?

Robbie shrugs.

Can I say something with a curse?

One time?

Yeah. Why not?

Robbie NODS, takes a deep breath.

Love is fucked.

Cal LAUGHS, a bit of tension relieved.

Is that so? You in love, buddy?

Well, if you must know --

JESSICA (O.S.)

Ding dong.

They turn -- it's Jessica, the baby-sitter.

What is she doing here?

Oh, right, hey, Jess, thanks for

27.

(back to Robbie)

I have to run out really quickly,

just for a few hours, and your

mother wants you to stay here

while she's out hooking --

What?

Huh?

The place is... nice, Mr. Weaver.

Yes, well, that's a generous

adjective, thank you.

Anyhow, Jess is gonna keep an eye

on you guys for a few.

But I don't need a babysitter!

She's only four years older than

me! You need to know that! She

needs to know that!

I know, buddy.

Cal musses Robbie's hair.

My little boy's growing up, Jess.

He's in love already, can you

believe it?

Uch. Robbie thumps the wall with his head, dying.

Molly, say bye-bye to Daddy?

No response, she's glued to the television.

Wait, where are you going?

I'm, uh... I decided to take a

class.

28.

That's great, Mr. Weaver. It's a

difficult time for you, it's

important that you find new

interests, try new things, maybe

things you'd never have considered

trying before...

Cal looks down, Jessica has her hand on his shoulder.

It's a bit odd. She realizes, takes it off.

Okay, well... Molly, last chance!?

But Molly is still locked on Efron.

That's my angel. Back in a few.

But, Dad --

Nope.

The door slams. Robbie stands there with Jessica,

awkward. Tries to maintain some semblance of cool.

I don't need a baby-sitter.

I know, Robbie.

An awkward beat, then.

I love you so much --

Jesus Christ.

Cal pulls into the parking lot, grabs a space.

What am I doing?

He ENTERS, still going.

29.

What the hell am I doing?

He walks past a CHEESECAKE FACTORY. Inside is...

Hannah (girl from the bar who Jacob tried picking up).

She's sitting at a table with Liz (her friend) and a

GROUP OF REALLY BORING WHITE PEOPLE in suits. There are

SMALL GIFTS in front of Hannah.

Holding her hand is an average guy (33), her boyfriend,

RICHARD. We PICK UP mid-conversation.

I think you're wrong. I think

that's Tucker.

No, no, no. Chris Rock is the

stand-up comedian. Chris Tucker

is the actor.

Is it racist that I can't tell

them apart?

Liz nods her head "yes" at Hannah. Hannah stifles a

LAUGH. Liz stands.

Well, Richard: thank you for

inviting me to Hannah's `goodbye'

party. The conversation has been

riveting, like stepping back in

time. Before I go, a toast.

She holds up her glass, toasting.

Sweetie: go into your hole and

study your cute little ass off for

that bar exam. We'll see you when

you emerge.

She's gonna kick that bar's butt!

All the dorks CHEER. Liz SHRUGS.

Yeah, okay.

30.

Liz CHUGS her drink, turns to Hannah.

I'll walk you out.

Before they clear...

Hey, Liz? When my girl passes,

we're gonna have another little

celebration, right here. Hope you

can make it. It's going to be a

special night.

Richard, you just give me a heads-

up so I can get really drunk

before-hand, okay?

You know it!

Hannah leads Liz out of the restaurant, WHISPERS:

Did you hear that? `It's going to

be a special night.' You think

he's going to propose?

At the Cheesecake Factory? Oh

God, I hope not.

Why? Do you really want him to?

Hannah SHRUGS.

He's nice.

Yeah, well... Jesus. Really?

(with a shrug)

Okay. Not my life, I love you,

call me if you need anything.

Liz KISSES her goodbye, EXITS. Hannah looks at her

table. Everyone is typing on their BLACKBERRIES.

She SIGHS, heads to rejoin them.

31.

Meanwhile, Cal sees Jacob, standing against a pole in the

food court. Jacob is eating pizza, cool as ever.

You're late.

(then, offering)

Sbarro's?

No thanks. So what exactly are

How much money can you afford to

spend on clothes today?

I dunno. Five hundred?

Three thousand.

Okay.

We'll start with shoes. Let me

see those sneakers you're wearing.

Cal holds up his foot.

Take them off.

Cal bends down, takes one off.

Other one too, please?

Cal does as he's told. Jacob holds out his hands. Cal

SHRUGS, hands Jacob the shoes.

Jacob simply turns and throws them over the railing.

What the hell!?

Are you in a fraternity, Cal?

Those were my favorite shoes.

32.

ARE YOU IN A FRATERNITY, CAL!?

No.

Are you Steve Jobs?

What?

ARE YOU THE BILLIONAIRE OWNER OF

APPLE COMPUTERS?

No. I'm not Steve Jobs.

Then you don't need to walk around

in New Balance Sneaker, ever.

Let's go.

Cal (barefoot) follows Jacob around the store.

I think this whole thing might

have been a bad idea.

Jacob ignores him, grabs a pair of BLACK DRESS SHOES.

Any man can rebuild his entire

wardrobe with sixteen simple

items.

Ha! I think I read that in GQ.

You did. I wrote it.

Really?

Jacob CHUCKLES. Cal CHUCKLES back, clearly unsure what

the chuckle symbolizes.

Numbers one and two: pair of

dress shoes, pair of loafers.

33.

Cal is looking at a pair of ARGYLE SOCKS.

I'm sorry, I'm lost: do you

really write for GQ?

Jacob slaps Cal's hand, knocking the socks away.

Your credit card please?

MONTAGE - FROM STORE TO STORE

We watch as Jacob narrates the wardrobe essentials (and

as Cal's arms get progressively fuller) in each store.

Cal gets fitted.

JACOB (V.O.)

Two suits: one black, one grey.

One sports jacket, navy preferred.

Jacob leans in toward the tailor.

Take it in there... and there.

Cal holds jeans in front of him, eyes them suspiciously.

JACOB (V.O.)

One pair of quality jeans.

These are two hundred and thirty

dollars. Can't we just go to the

Gap?

He looks up. Jacob is gone.

SMASH CUT TO:

Cal runs outside. Jacob is already halfway to the car.

I'm sorry! Don't leave!

34.

Jacob immediately heads back inside and answers:

No, Cal. We can't just go to the

Gap.

What's wrong with the Gap?

In Hell, every store is the Gap,

that's what's wrong with the Gap,

Cal. It's lowest common

denominator. Be better than the

fucking Gap, Cal.

Jacob holds up a pair of beige slacks.

JACOB (V.O.)

One pair of chinos.

CHING. A cash register DINGS.

JACOB (V.O.)

Four dress shirts.

CHING. CHING. CHING. CHING. Cal's arms are filling.

JACOB (V.O.)

Three casual button-downs.

CHING. CHING. CHING. In a dressing room shirts come

flying over the wall at Cal.

Cal struggles to get a sweater over his neck.

JACOB (V.O.)

Two v-neck cashmere sweaters, and

finally, a long overcoat.

Cal stands there in an overcoat and sweater.

I'm very warm.

Jacob leads Cal through the store. He tosses him a TUBE.

35.

You rub this in around your eyes

every night and every morning.

What does it do?

It gives you x-ray vision, Cal.

It tightens things up. The skin

around your eyes looks like Milton

Berle's ballsack.

Cal stops, examines his eyes in a mirror.

Oh my God, it does.

Cal is getting his hair cut at a fancy salon. The

HAIRDRESSER is young, hip, and beautiful.

I like to use a number four on the

sides and the back, go longer on

the top.

Oh, okay. Thanks for that, Vidal

Sassoon. Tiffany, hon? Scissor

cut, tight on sides, get him some

texture up top, take off about...

He touches Cal's hair, measures it between his fingers.

Eww.

... inch off the top.

Yes, sir.

Tiffany starts chopping.

36.

Jacob and Tiffany wait for Cal (inside a changing room).

What are you putting on?

CAL (O.S.)

Items one, three, eleven, and

fourteen.

Perfect.

(then, to Tiffany)

You smell great by the way.

Thanks.

What are you doing tonight?

I don't know.

That's okay, I do.

She GIGGLES. Cal calls out.

CAL (O.S.)

Seriously? You just ask her out

like that?

Yes, Cal, just like that.

CAL (O.S.)

And it works?

Yes. Yes.

CAL (O.S.)

Crazy.

Okay, I feel kind of stupid but...

The DRESSING ROOM DOOR opens. We TILT UP... FROM

expensive shoes, TO pants, TO fitted sweater over a

fitted shirt and bright tie. The new haircut...

A new man. He looks... unbelievable.

37.

Wow.

Yep.

Can I blouse out the shirt a

little? I like to blouse out my

shirts a little.

Shut up, Cal.

You'd fuck him, right?

Jesus!

Yeah, probably.

Tiffany!

(then, realizing)

You would!?

Tiffany SHRUGS.

You see that, Cal? The simple act

of opening your mouth instantly

causes Tiffany to lose interest in

sleeping with you. Your

personality is actually your

weakest link.

Cal takes this in.

Well, that's the meanest thing

anyone's ever said to me.

No, Cal. The meanest thing

anyone's ever said to you is this:

your wife cheated on you because

you lost sight of what it took to

keep her content at home -- as a

man, as a husband, and probably as

a lover.

Cal's lower lip begins to quiver.

38.

Yeah, okay, that was meaner.

Cal sits next to Jacob. Cal is wearing his new "outfit."

He looks great, but not yet comfortable in his new

"gear."

Jacob, on the other hand, looks like he's walked out of a

men's magazine. And he knows it. Cal looks at Jacob.

I notice you only button your

shirts up, like, halfway. I can't

pull that off, right?

No. Listen, Cal, I'm going to be

calling women over to our table

shortly.

Cal rubs his hands together, nervous.

We should have some background on

each other, no? I'm in insurance,

more on the corporate side. My

kids are --

Cal, the only thing I care less

about than corporate insurance are

your kids. Here's the only thing

I need to know: how many women

have you been with?

Sexually?

Yes.

In my entire life?

No, synchronized swimming. Yes,

Cal. Sexually.

Cal thinks. He MUMBLES to himself, counting it out on

one hand.

39.

He smiles at Jacob proudly when he has to move the count

to a second hand. Then:

One.

Jacob CHORTLES. But Cal just stares at him blankly.

Wow, okay... wow.

(then, checking)

Not at a time? Total?

What? I married young. We met in

high school.

He smiles, remembering.

Tracy was so damn beautiful. You

know those women, the ones who can

be wildly sexy and unbelievably

cute all at once? I never knew

how she did that. I still don't

know how she does it.

Anyway, we had a bit of a hiccup

our senior year but we made it --

Cal, I literally stopped listening

at `Tracy.' Okay, here we go.

(a bit emotional)

I miss my wife.

Shut up, Cal.

A YOUNG WOMAN slides into the booth at Jacob's side.

Hi.

Hi. Jacob Palmer.

Amy Johnson.

Cal extends his hand.

40.

Don't.

He pulls it back.

-- Weaver.

Can I get you a drink, Amy?

gets handed over to: a NEW GIRL, on a NEW NIGHT.

Tell me about yourself. What do

you do?

Does it really matter?

It does to me.

She looks up. He looks completely earnest, repeats:

It does to me.

She smiles.

PAN TO CAL: just sitting there watching, horrified.

Now with NEWER GIRL.

And that's when I started writing

the column for LA Weekly. God,

how long have I been talking?

Jacob takes her hand.

41.

Listen, I'm going to be honest:

it's getting late and I think

you're interesting. I also think

you're one of those rare women who

manages to be both wildly sexy and

incredibly cute all at once.

Mouth agape. That was his line!

Let's get out of here. I know

it's forward of me but just... I

think we should get out of here.

She thinks, then NODS.

Okay.

FLASH CUT TO:

I think we should get out of here.

Okay.

FLASH CUT TO:

I think we should get out of here.

Okay.

waving goodbye awkwardly as Jacob leaves with each of the

girls (IN QUICK CUTS). Finally:

42.

Cal just sits there, completely alone. But then A PRETTY

GIRL arrives at his table. Cal looks up, smiles. She

smiles back, then:

She drops THE BILL on the table. She's a waitress. And

he's been left with the tab.

ON THE BLACKBOARD: "SCARLET LETTER, THEMES."

Robbie Weaver sits at his 8th grade desk. In the b.g.,

we hear a FEMALE TEACHER drone on about The Scarlet

Letter. Under his desk, Robbie is TEXTING.

receiving the text.

ON THE CELL PHONE SCREEN

The text: "Hi, Jessica. FYI: Demi Moore is 15 yrs

older than Ashton K. They seem really happy. Love,

Robbie."

Her phone BEEPS with a NEW TEXT: "P.S. did you know Demi

Moore starred in the movie version of The Scarlet

Letter?"

Her phone BEEPS a third time: "She shows boob :-)"

She SIGHS.

Pleased with himself. The FEMALE TEACHER drones on in

the b.g.

TEACHER (O.S.)

While Hester is forced to wear a

scarlet `A' as punishment for

adultery, Reverend Dimmesdale's

`A' is self-inflicted --

Robbie's PHONE BEEPS. A "NEW MESSAGE." Robbie smiles.

43.

ON THE CELL PHONE SCREEN

The text: "Robbie: please stop. U r making me very

uncomfortable."

BACK TO SCENE

Robbie stares at the screen, crestfallen.

TEACHER (O.S.)

Mr. Weaver? Are we interrupting?

Robbie looks up: the WHOLE CLASS is staring at him.

TEACHER (O.S.)

Mr. Weaver!

Slowly, Robbie stands. We HEAD IN TIGHT ON him.

You want to talk about The Scarlet

Letter, Mrs. Thompson? Here you

go: the `A' they're both wearing

-- I think it stands for ASSHOLE.

Wanna know why? Because they're

in love, and love is for stupid

ASSHOLES. So thanks for choosing

this book, Mrs. Thompson, because

this is what I need right now: to

read a boring, confusing book

about a bunch of stupid assholes

who fell in love, like assholes,

and then had to die, like

assholes. I'm sorry for cursing.

Tracy works at her desk. A KNOCK at her door interrupts.

A TALL MAN (40's) stands there: DAVID JACOBOWITZ.

You have a second?

Oh, David. I'm just a little

swamped right now so...

He closes the door behind him.

You've been avoiding me.

44.

No, I haven't.

You ran away in the other

direction when you saw me coming

down the hall yesterday.

You're very fast by the way.

She SIGHS, gives up.

I ran track in high school.

That must be it.

He turns serious.

I'm sorry about you and Cal.

Thank you.

I'm also not sorry, if I'm being

completely honest.

I want to make sure you know how

much I like you.

No, I do --

A lot. Just to clarify. I like

you a lot. I had no intention of

falling for a married woman. I

just wanted someone to go to lunch

with who didn't make me want to

shoot myself in the face. But we

started having lunch, and talking,

and suddenly I was an accountant

who was popping out of bed in the

morning, excited to get to work.

That doesn't happen to

accountants. Ever. I've checked

with other accountants.

She smiles.

45.

So when the time is right for you

to get back out there again,

officially, I just... I'd like to

throw my hat in the ring.

Officially. That sounded weird.

Tracy LAUGHS lightly, leans forward.

David, you've been a great friend

to me. And you were the first man

in a very long time to make me

feel... noticed, I guess? What

happened between us that night...

it meant something to me. You

weren't the only one excited to

come to work lately.

David smiles.

But now, when I see you, all I see

is his face. All I see when I

look at you is what I did to my

marriage.

She's losing it, wipes her eyes.

You see this? I'm saving you from

disaster, David, `cause you're

asking to pre-board the Titanic.

Honestly, do you really want any

part of this?

Before he can answer... BUZZ! It's Tracy's phone.

ASSISTANT (V.O.)

Your son's school on two.

Tracy quickly picks up phone. As she talks, David

scribbles something on a postcard, EXITS.

Right, okay. No, I understand.

Of course, right away.

She HANGS UP, looks at the Post-It. It reads, simply:

"Yes." Tracy looks up, but David is gone.

46.

Robbie sits, waiting. Tracy EMERGES.

(calling back in)

Yes, of course. Absolutely,

Principal Sapienza, it won't

happen again.

She closes the door behind her, looks to Robbie.

Seriously?

Sorry.

She SIGHS.

It's been a rough couple of weeks,

you deserve a freebie. C'mon, I

have to get back to work.

They walk out together.

They still make kids read The

Scarlet Letter, huh?

Robbie NODS.

You'd really think someone would

have written something better by

now.

Robbie LAUGHS, the tension broken a bit.

Robbie wheels around in an office chair as Tracy tries to

work behind her desk. He stops, noticing a PHOTO.

It's an older picture of CAL AND TRACY. They look happy.

Very much in love. Tracy notices.

Guess I should take it down, huh?

I guess.

47.

Tracy NODS. She places the picture face down gently.

She tries to return to her work, but can't.

How is he? I've spoken to him but

only about bills, or you kids,

but... how is he, really?

Robbie hesitates.

Sorry, that's unfair. Ignore me,

I'm almost done here.

She turns back to her work. After a beat:

He's dressing a lot better. Going

out a lot.

Oh. Well, good. That's... really

good.

(then, covering)

We'll get take-out for dinner

tonight, okay? Think about what

you're in the mood for.

Robbie hesitates, then adds:

He's sad. He looks better, but...

sadder, too, I think. You know?

Yeah. I guess I'm pretty sad,

too.

I know.

You do?

I heard you crying the other night

and... I didn't know what to do.

I'm thirteen years old and... can

you just tell me what I'm supposed

to do in that situation? I didn't

want to Google it.

She smiles, shakes her head.

48.

Oh God, baby, you're so much like

me it's scary. You wound up with

all my stuff, Robbie. I'm so

sorry.

I'm okay with being like you, Mom.

I like you.

She puts down her pen. Smiles sadly at Robbie.

It's my fault, what happened with

your father. It's grown-up stuff

that I can't talk about but...

it's my fault. Not his. So

just... be good to him, okay?

It'll be okay, Mom.

You promise?

He NODS, the most soulful thirteen-year-old ever.

DAVID JACOBOWITZ (O.S.)

Hey, they need you in the

conference room for a sec... oh,

sorry.

They look up. It's David. Tracy gathers herself,

stands.

David, this is my son, Robbie.

Robbie, this is David.

We work together.

Robbie takes him in, shakes his hand.

I'll be right back, okay, honey?

Okay. Okay.

Awkward. Really awkward. Tracy starts to say something,

thinks better of it, and EXITS.

David moves into the room, sits down opposite Robbie.

49.

So, Robbie... I hear you're quite

the soccer player.

So, David... I hear you broke up

my parents' marriage.

He LAUGHS awkwardly, shocked.

You are David Jacobowitz, right?

From accounting?

Um, yes I am --

Here's the thing, David: in the

end, she winds up back with my

dad. He's better than you, in

every category except probably

math. And she still loves him.

Robbie props the PHOTO of Tracy and Cal back up.

Listen, Robbie --

Now I know what you're thinking:

`he's just in 8th grade, what does

he know about love?' I know a lot

more than you think, David. Just

today, I had a meltdown, almost

gave up on the love of my life.

My dad's having his meltdown now,

but long-term? He won't stop

fighting for my mom any more than

I won't stop sending Jessica texts

that make her uncomfortable. And

you need to know that.

Tracy RE-ENTERS.

You ready to go?

Mommy, can we do Chinese for

dinner tonight?

50.

Tracy waves to David as she and Robbie EXIT, leaving him

stunned in the middle of her office, staring at:

THE PHOTO OF CAL AND TRACY that Robbie has left directly

in his line of sight.

Bushes rustle. Once, then twice. It's Cal, sneaking

into the backyard. He takes a covert look inside the

house. All is quiet. He gets to work.

-- He spreads FERTILIZER on the grass.

-- Trims some bushes.

-- Picks off some petals from some dying flowers.

It's the strangest goddamn thing you've ever seen.

Finally, he finishes.

Content. His yard may not be his anymore, but it's back

in order. As he takes it all in...

A LIGHT pops on.

Cal DIVES into a SHRUB.

Another night at the bar: Cal's in his position, Jacob

in his. Cal sips his drink, staring aimlessly forward.

Jacob looks at Cal. Cal looks great, more comfortable in

his new "skin" than when we left him. He's drinking a

martini, rather than a red-strawed vodka cranberry.

A WAITRESS passes. Without speaking, Cal taps the rim of

the glass, silently requesting a refill. It's a cool,

practiced move... and he did it instinctively.

Jacob smiles, leans forward.

I think you're ready, Cal.

For what?

51.

To talk to a woman, take a woman

home.

Oh, no. No, I'm not.

You've been watching me do it for

two weeks.

Yeah, well, I've been watching

LeBron James for years, doesn't

mean I can suddenly dunk a

basketball.

Cal, do you remember the part in

Karate Kid, where Mr. Miagi keeps

having the kid wax the car and the

kid gets all bent out of shape

because he doesn't see the point,

but the movements were actually

building blocks for throwing and

blocking punches?

Oh God. Are you going to make me

fight someone?

Jacob stretches his neck, trying his patience:

Cal, what's the first thing I do

when a woman sits down?

You ask if you can buy her a

drink.

And what if she says no?

You order her a drink anyway, let

it sit there.

When she asks me a question about

myself?

52.

You deflect it back to her. You

never answer questions about

yourself.

And what happens?

They talk about themselves. A

lot.

And what do I do?

You act really interested. You

nod a lot.

And at the end of the night?

You compliment them, then you ask

if they'd like to come back to

your place.

Do I ask?

No. You confidently tell them

you'd like them to come back to

your place.

Holy shit! You Mr. Miagi'd me!

Jacob BOWS to Cal, Japanese style. A PRETTY WOMAN stands

near their table. Jacob stands, smiles.

Oh, and no talking about your job,

your children, your pathetic

sexual history, or David

Jacobowitz. Okay, here we go...

What, no, I'm not ready for --

(then, to woman)

Hi!

Jacob has pulled her over. She's attractive, mid-

thirties.

53.

Cal, this is Kate. Kate, Cal.

Jacob NODS at Cal ("you've got this") and leaves them.

Kate SITS. Cal smiles at Kate, nervous. She smiles

back. Cal MOTIONS for a waitress in the distance.

Can I buy you a drink, Kate?

KATE (PRETTY WOMAN)

Oh. No thank you.

Cal smiles, portrays confidence.

I'm buying you a drink anyway,

Kate, so you might as well tell me

what you want.

Really, thank you but it's okay.

I'm guessing you're a vodka girl,

am I right? Yeah? A nice dirty

martini? No, no, no: a Grey

Goose, rocks, extra lime? C'mon,

one drink! Picture those ice

cubes clinking together. Mmmm.

Can't you taste it?

She smiles.

Yes, I can but... I'm, uh, five

years sober so...

Cal's face drops. The WAITRESS approaches.

What can I get --

Nothing. We don't want anything.

Don't come back here ever.

The Waitress leaves, confused. Kate looks around,

uncomfortable. She tries small-talk.

So... what do you do, Cal?

What do you do, Kate?

54.

I asked you first.

I asked you second.

She LAUGHS lightly, thinks he's being funny.

Seriously, what do you do?

Seriously, what do you do?

Now it's getting a little weird.

I'm a teacher. Now, c'mon: what

do you do?

Cal NODS, exaggerated.

Teacher. Interesting. I'm very

interested in teaching.

I'm sorry, are you not going to

tell me what you do?

He's still nodding, as if fascinated.

A teacher with an alcohol

dependency no less, I bet that's

actually more common than people

realize...

I should get back to my friends --

Kate STANDS. Cal puts his face in his hands.

I'm sorry! I'm supposed to

deflect your questions... oh screw

it: I'm in corporate insurance.

And I have children. Plural.

More than one. The only thing I

have ONE of, is sexual partners,

that would be the woman I recently

separated from because she was

cheating on me with David

Jacobowitz who I wasn't supposed

to tell you about either.

55.

Kate turns back, curious.

What were you supposed to tell me?

I don't know: that you're a

perfect combination of sexy and

cute -- it was something I said

about my wife that's since been

corrupted. But I'm tired, and I'm

at least fifteen years older than

you, and this sweater is called

slim fitting but it's really just

uncomfortable and itchy.

You think I'm a perfect

combination of sexy and cute?

Cal looks up.

That's what you took away from

that?

She smiles, sits back down.

Wow, an actual honest man. I

don't know what to do with that.

It's kind of... rare around here.

It's nice, actually.

It is?

You have no idea. I'm kind of a

magnet for these jerk-offs. They

charm me, and I fall for it, and

at some point they just... never

call me again.

I don't understand. Look at you.

Who wouldn't call you again?

She looks up. It's not a line, it's a genuine

compliment. She smiles warmly. Holy shit, Cal is in!

56.

So... what were you `supposed' to

do next?

Well, eventually I'm `supposed' to

ask you if you want to get out of

here. Actually no, I'm supposed

to tell you, confidently, that you

should come home with me.

Why don't you give it a shot, see

what happens?

Cal looks up, surprised. He clears his throat, then:

You're very pretty, Kate. And I

can't tell if you're being

serious, but I think you should

come home with me.

Ask me again.

Cal smiles and leans forward, faux-confident.

I'm not asking you, Kate. I'm

telling you: you should come home

with me.

Kate looks up, genuinely turned-on.

CUE MUSIC: "SEXYBACK" by Justin Timberlake.

SMASH CUT TO:

Cal and Kate BARGE in, passionately kissing.

(gasping for breath)

This is my dumpy apartment that I

had to move into when I left my

wife.

57.

I love that you're being so

honest. It's so different, so

hot.

I've never been with a woman

besides my ex-wife.

More, tell me more.

I'm worried you have AIDS.

She stops.

Only a little.

She pushes him down on the couch, takes her sweater off.

She's wearing just a bra. She looks amazing.

What do you want to do with me?

Show you off to my wife to make

her jealous.

She GROWLS and dives on top of him as we launch:

-- The next morning a DISHEVELED CAL lets Kate out, gives

her a big passionate kiss, and closes the DOOR.

-- We STAY ON the DOOR. After a beat, it opens up: as

Cal bids farewell to a NEW GIRL on a new morning.

Cal strides in -- a skip in his step, a perfectly

tailored suit on his body. Everything's in SLOW MOTION.

He points at someone, winks at a waitress...

A SAD SACK GUY at the bar watches Cal stride by, jealous.

Cal Weaver has evolved into "the fucking man."

58.

1) HANNAH studies late into the night for the bar. 2)

JESSICA reads magazine articles on "How to Make Him

Notice You." 3) TRACY eats ice cream in bed, alone. 4)

ROBBIE drags mysterious wood planks into his backyard.

But we're mainly with CAL...

A NEW WOMAN EXITS. The door closes. It re-opens as he

kisses goodbye ANOTHER WOMAN!

are mid-conversation.

... it would work!

You're out of your mind.

What do college guys hate? Doing

laundry. What do they love?

Strippers. It's a strip club

where they can do their laundry.

It's ridiculous.

And yours isn't? A candy store

that only sells red candy.

Everyone loves the cherry. Look,

I'm not rejecting the psuedo-

cherry flavors like raspberry or

strawberry, anything in the -erry

family is allowed. But let's be

real here: no one wants the

lemon. No one likes the grape.

I like grape.

Well then you can't come to my

store.

59.

They LAUGH, quickly becoming inseparable.

A late 40s couple eat dinner: BERNIE (the big guy who

"broke up" with Cal earlier) and CLAIRE, a bubbly little

woman -- the polar opposite of her husband.

Oh, I almost forgot -- heard some

good gossip at the nail salon.

For God's sake, Claire.

It's about Cal.

Leave the poor bastard alone,

would you? I gave him the cologne

like you told me to. We don't

have to dance on his grave.

VOICE (O.S.)

What did you hear about Mr.

Weaver, Mom?

PULL BACK -- JESSICA (THE BABYSITTER) SITS AT THE NEARBY

COUNTER, EATING NEXT TO HER LITTLE BROTHER (13).

Apparently, Mr. Weaver has become

quite a man-about-town if you get

my drift.

What?

Lots of young women coming in and

out of his apartment lately.

Claire, would you cut it out?

It's good for Jess to know. She

still baby-sits for him after all.

60.

Oh, c'mon! Enough.

Well, it's good gossip at the

least. Ooh, guess what else I

heard...

As she CONTINUES CHATTERING in the b.g., we HOLD ON

Jessica. Thinking.

Jessica waits at her LOCKER. She spots a TALL BLONDE

GIRL moving down the hallway, texting as she walks.

Madison! Madison, wait!

Madison stops walking, but not texting.

Hey, I had a question --

Madison holds up a finger ("one second") and continues

texting. Finally, she stops. Looks up. Smiles.

Hey, Jessica, whassup?

I had a question for you, Madison.

It's kind of on the personal side

so...

My lips are...

Madison extends her arms, begins clapping and making

WEIRD NOISES. Jessica stares at her blankly.

Seals.

My lips are seals.

Oh, okay. So, Madison, here's the

thing... I don't mean to be blunt

or insulting but, let's call it

what it is: you're always

sleeping with older guys, right?

61.

Always.

Lots of college guys, I've heard.

Lots of them.

Even rumors about a few teachers.

Totally.

So my question is: how do you do

that? I mean, how do you get them

not to see you as... well, a kid

in high school?

Oh, well first off, I have a huge

rack.

You do, yes.

So that helps.

Yes, I'm sure it does.

You don't have a huge rack.

No, I don't unfortunately.

So that's not gonna work.

Nope.

Madison SIGHS.

Okay, here's what you do. Wait,

how old is he?

Old.

62.

Like really old?

Like parent old.

Nasty. Rock on, Jessica.

Thank you, Madison.

Alright, you have to hook him.

Force his hand. Make him unable

to stop himself from doing what he

knows to be wrong.

How?

Do what I do. Send him a postcard

from downtown.

Huh?

Go TMZ on his ass.

I'm not following you, Madis--

The full gyno.

Off Jessica's blank look.

A crotch shot? A nip slip?

A dirty picture! You can even

Annie Leibowitz it. Tasteful but

with nipple. Yeah, that's what

you should do: make it artistic.

Black and white. Make this face.

She makes a raw sexual face.

Jesus, Madison!

63.

Well, you came to me for advice,

that's my advice. You put those

across his radar, he won't see you

as a little girl anymore, that's

for sure.

Madison walks off, calls back.

Don't send it to him as a jpeg,

though. He'll put it up on his

fantasy football web-site. And

then your brother sees it, tells

your mom, and suddenly you're not

allowed to use Facebook for a

month. Thanks, Kevin!

She leaves Jessica there, processing the advice.

Jessica EXITS the school, lost in thought. There's a bit

of commotion outside. TEENAGERS are pointing and

LAUGHING at something.

Jessica pushes through and sees:

ROBBIE, standing atop a man-made, tall, wooden

platform/scaffold in front of the school.

There she is!

Oh shit.

BACK TO ROBBIE

as he RIPS OPEN his button-up shirt, revealing a SCARLET

J taped to his pale, hairless chest. He has recreated

the famous Scarlet Letter tableau. He pulls out a piece

of paper, reads it.

64.

Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote in The

Scarlet Letter: `No man for any

considerable period can wear one

face to himself and another to the

multitude, without finally getting

bewildered as to which may be the

true.'

Robbie puts down the paper, ignoring the jeers.

I am not bewildered! Jessica

Riley is my soulmate. She's the

one! I know it to be true, and so

now do the multitude.

Multitudes?

(then, deciding)

No, multitude.

Robbie, get down!

I have marked myself with this

Scarlet J, Jessica! For you.

Because your name starts with a J.

It's just tape and construction

paper but one day I will get a

permanent tattoo when I'm old

enough that my parents won't freak

out on me.

Robbie Weaver! I am your baby-

sitter and I'm telling you to GET

YOUR ASS DOWN FROM THERE NOW!

That does the trick. He gets down to mocking APPLAUSE.

Jessica pulls him off to the side.

What the hell are you thinking?

You like the scaffold? It has

wheels. Took four weeks to build

it.

Oh, those are my friends, they

helped me wheel it down. Wave

hello.

65.

OFF TO THE SIDE: Three excited THIRTEEN-YEAR-OLDS WAVE

and give THUMBS-UPS to Robbie. Jessica waves, confused,

turns back to Robbie.

This has to stop, Robbie.

Seriously.

You'll learn to love me. I

promise.

I won't.

Just because I'm four years

younger than you?

BECAUSE I LOVE SOMEONE ELSE!!!

This stops Robbie dead in his tracks.

I've been spending time with him

for a while.

Robbie stumbles, less sure-footed than usual.

No. You can't. I've checked. No

boyfriend since ninth grade. No

date for Spring Formal last

He's older. I don't want my

parents to know.

And with that, Robbie literally just sits down on the

ground, all the wind taken out of him. It might be the

cutest thing you've ever seen.

Who is he?

It doesn't matter.

Do I know him? Is he from town?

I don't know. Yes, kind of.

66.

I'll kill him if he hurts you.

Jessica tries not to smile.

I know. But this all has to stop

now, Robbie. The speeches, the

texts, all of it. It's very

sweet, but it has to stop.

He just sits there, lost.

I'll see you around, okay?

She EXITS. Robbie remains seated on the grass.

Devastated. His three friends approach.

We should probably get the

scaffold back on the road before

dark.

Yeah.

Robbie's on the couch, dejected. His little sister sits

next to him, watching High School Musical as always.

In the adjoining kitchen, Cal is on the phone.

Hey, Nanna! I know, it's been

forever. Have you been getting

out at all? I'll bring you some

of that deli you like one night,

okay? The kids? They're fine.

(to other room)

Kids, say hi to Nanna.

ROBBIE AND MOLLY

Hi, Nanna!

Oh, I've been keeping busy. Made

a new buddy, I've been spending

time with him. Yeah, I'm going to

see her tomorrow night. Of course

I miss her. You don't know how

much I miss...

67.

His voice cracks. He turns, sees Robbie staring. He

heads into the bathroom with the phone, closes the door.

Robbie SIGHS, turns back to the TV.

Cal and Robbie are having a catch. Robbie is listless.

So you're seeing Mom tomorrow,

huh? At my parent-teacher thing?

Yeah.

First time in a while.

Yeah, but no biggie.

Cal tosses him back the ball.

Hey, what's with the moping?

Nothing. It's just... there's

this girl.

Cal smiles.

Oh yeah? You like her?

I like Pringles. This girl's my

soulmate. I'm like crazy, stupid,

in love with her. And she wants

someone else.

But she's your soulmate?

Yeah.

Well you can't just give up.

68.

Why not?

(then, quietly)

You did.

Cal freezes.

Mom was yours, right?

I didn't give up.

Listen, Dad. I love you. I have

your back, always. But let's be

honest here: the woman told you

she wanted a divorce and you

jumped out of a car.

It was slightly more complicated

than that. And I'm a different

guy now.

You're the same guy. You just

have different clothes. Do you

still love her?

How old ARE you?

Do you still love Mom?

Cal doesn't say anything. His silence speaks volumes.

Weren't we talking about you?

We are. Your son is in desperate

need of some romantic inspiration.

So set an example for your boy.

Don't give up. It's complicated?

Uncomplicate it. She says no?

Change her mind. Look at you,

you're the man right now, Dad.

Get her back.

Get back my mom.

69.

Robbie punctuates his pep talk by tossing Cal the ball,

hard.

Cal is lost in thought. The ball sails past him and

THROUGH THE WINDOW of a nearby car.

PARENTS walk hand-in-hand, into the school. It's Parent-

Teacher conference night.

Cal sits on a small chair outside a classroom. Tracy

approaches.

TRACY (O.S.)

Wow.

Cal looks up. Tracy stands there. She's dressed down,

but looks amazing. Vulnerable and nervous.

You look great, Cal.

Oh, well turns out I've been

buying the wrong size suit for

twenty years so...

Well you look great. Really.

Cal smiles.

Thank you.

You always look great, so...

Awkward. Neither knows what to say now. Tracy takes the

seat next to him.

I talked to Nanna yesterday.

Me, too. She sound okay to you?

She sounded like... Nanna. She

worries about us.

70.

Tracy NODS. A long beat, then:

I feel like I'm about to get

detention.

Tracy LAUGHS, tension broken a bit.

Which teacher is this?

Mrs. Thompson. This is the one

he pulled The Scarlet Letter

Asshole routine on.

Cal smiles.

He's a really weird kid, isn't he?

Yeah.

I kind of like him, though.

I do, too. I'm so glad we

switched the babies at the

hospital.

Me, too.

They LAUGH. God, these two are great together when

they're in rhythm. The laughter trickles away.

An awkward beat, then:

So, how are things with...

(a beat, then)

How's it going with David?

She looks down.

Oh... it's not.

It wasn't about him, if that means

anything.

No, I know.

71.

Cal looks at his watch, a nervous gesture.

You seeing anyone?

Who, me? No. You know me. No,

not really.

Oh. Because you hear things, you

know.

Yeah, well...

Another long beat of silence. Cal gathers himself, takes

a breath, and turns toward Tracy.

I miss you, T.

Tracy looks up surprised.

I got complacent, I think. You

find your soulmate in high

school... you've got the game

sewed up in the first quarter, you

know?

She smiles.

I put in an effort when we were

younger, didn't I? I'd do

anything to make you happy: take

you miniature golfing, dancing --

you were such a good dancer.

I had to be. You were such a good

miniature golfer.

He smiles, emboldened.

All I ever wanted to do was make

you love me. And then you did,

really early on. And we got

married so young. And I guess...

I got lazy. I got boring. And

I'm furious at you for what you

did. But I don't totally blame

you, if that makes any sense?

72.

I shouldn't have jumped out of the

car. I should have fought for

you. You fight for your soulmate.

At least that's what our thirteen-

year-old tells me.

Tracy's eyes well up with tears.

He's a very strange boy, isn't he?

I'll be honest: he scares the

shit out of me.

She LAUGHS through her tears.

I missed you, too.

Cal takes her hand, kisses it.

VOICE (O.S.)

Mr. and Mrs. Weaver?

They turn around.

It's Robbie's English teacher, Mrs. Thompson... better

known to us as:

KATE (the teacher from the bar who Cal slept with).

Cal freezes, his lips on Tracy's hand.

Oh God.

Cal? What are you doing here?

(looking to the sky)

Really?

You two know each other?

Um, yes... we've met before.

73.

We've met before? Seriously?

Mrs. Thompson? This is my wife.

Tracy.

Oh, so now she's your WIFE again?

HOW CONVENIENT!

Kate's getting louder now.

Why don't we head inside?

YES, WHY DON'T WE!?

She STORMS INSIDE. Tracy looks at Cal, follows her in.

Kate PACES in front of the classroom.

I'm sorry, I'm playing catch-up:

how do you two know each other?

Maybe your husband should tell

you.

Cal hesitates.

We have a mutual friend.

Ha!

You know, maybe we should focus on

Robbie?

Yes, let's do that. Let's focus

on Robbie.

Kate goes to her blackboard.

74.

As you know, Robbie's shining

moment this year was when he set a

school record for cursing in an

eighth grade English class.

She writes on the board: ASSHOLE. She underlines it.

Asshole. Are you familiar with

this word, Mrs. Weaver?

She's heard it, yes. So in terms

of Robbie's progress --

Asshole: as in, someone who tells

a woman that he'll call, and never

does.

We were a little concerned about

Robbie's grade on his oral book

Asshole: as in, someone who uses

`honesty' to get a woman into bed

with him, but is actually full of

shit like the rest of them.

Because usually he's a very strong

public speaker --

Asshole: as in, someone who

allows a woman to go down on him

for forty-five minutes because

he's `nervous' --

OKAY! ENOUGH!!!

Kate stops. Cal turns to Tracy. She looks crestfallen.

I can explain.

Tracy rushes out of the room. Cal calls after her.

She's an alcoholic! You can't

trust what she says!

75.

KATE SCREAMS in horror. Cal races after Tracy. Kate

races after Cal.

A three-way chase:

Tracy, wait!

Leave me alone, Cal!

I'm sober for FIVE YEARS, you

ASSHOLE!

TEACHERS and PARENTS (including Jessica's parents),

stepping out into the hallway and following them outside.

Tracy races to her car.

Tracy, c'mon! We were separated.

(fumbling for keys)

I know, and I cheated, so it

doesn't make any sense for me to

be mad at you.

Okay, so --

I can't do this now, Cal.

Tracy, I love you.

Tell her she's the perfect

combination of sexy and cute,

ASSHOLE!

Tracy looks at Cal, stunned. That's their thing.

76.

It's a funny story, actually --

I'm going home.

She opens the car door.

Tracy, wait! Yes, I slept with

her! I slept with our son's

eighth grade teacher!

GASPS from the crowd. Claire (Jessica's Mom) takes a

picture with her cell phone.

But all it did was confirm what I

already knew: THAT I LOVE, YOU!

I LOVE YOU!!!

Tracy hesitates. Cal seizes the moment.

Before, you were the only woman

I'd ever been with or wanted to be

with. And now, even after I've

been with eleven women, you're

STILL...

He instantly trails off, realizing. MORE GASPS.

... the only woman I want to be

with.

I don't even know who you are.

Tracy gets in her car and speeds off.

(weakly, to himself)

I'm your soulmate.

Cal turns around to the crowd, only to be met...

By a SLAP ACROSS the face by Kate. She STORMS OFF.

HE DESERVED AN `A' ON THAT BOOK

REPORT AND YOU KNOW IT!

77.

THUNDER CRACKS in the sky. It begins to pour. Cal

stands there, soaked. He looks up at the sky.

REALLY!!!???

Meanwhile, the rain pours down as DINERS scurry into the

restaurant.

We've been here before... the same group of BORING PEOPLE

at the same table. Liz and Hannah CHAT off to the side.

There's a cake on the table that says "CONGRATS HANNAH!"

Richard stands on a chair.

Excuse me, everyone. Everyone!?

The room goes quiet.

Now, if we could get our guest of

honor over here... I forget what

she looks like, anyone remember?

POLITE LAUGHS. Liz GAGS herself with her finger, looks

at Hannah. Hannah takes a deep breath, downs her drink,

and walks over to Richard. Is this it?

I'm so proud of you, baby. I had

my doubts, of course...

More CHEESY LAUGHTER.

Now I did tell you that it'd be a

special night when you passed the

bar. And I'm a lawyer so you know

I never lie...

More HECKLING from the crowd. Liz desperately orders

another drink, barely able to take it.

So, Hannah, I'd like to formally

ask you, in front of all our

friends and colleagues...

78.

Hannah waits, frozen.

... if you'd like to become a

permanent lawyer at the firm of

Watkins, Goldberg, and Schmidt!?

CHEERS. Hannah steps back, breathless. Richard reacts.

You don't have a better offer

already, do you?

Everyone LAUGHS.

No, that's great. I just...

(then, privately)

I'm sorry, I thought... I thought

you were about to propose.

The room goes quiet, trying to hear.

What?

No, I just... it's fine. I'm

sorry, I just got thrown is all.

Richard pulls Hannah off to the side.

Honey, I'm so sorry, I didn't

realize.

No, no, don't be silly, it's fine.

It's definitely a possibility,

down the road. I think I just

need a little more time. I'm

still figuring out how I feel

about us, you know: long-term.

No, I know...

Wait -- you're figuring out how

you feel about us?

She LAUGHS. Once. Then twice. Loudly. Everyone's now

watching. Liz gets a good seat, excited.

79.

Honey?

She's really laughing now.

You know what the best part is: I

would have said yes! To YOU! And

I didn't even want you to propose!

Just now, I swear to God: I was

hoping you wouldn't propose. And

I still would have said YES!

That's how pathetic I am!

She snags someone else's drink from the table, DOWNS IT.

She grabs Richard's cheeks.

I will consider your job offer,

thank you so much, Richard.

Hysterically LAUGHING, she walks away. As she passes,

Liz sticks out her hand and they slap five.

Meanwhile, Jacob sits alone in the bar. He checks his

watch. No Cal.

Suddenly, he looks very alone at his usual table.

He shakes it off, stands, and approaches the table of a

group of nearby WOMEN.

ON THE WOMEN

One of them is telling a story:

And you know what she said?

JACOB (O.S.)

What? What did she say?

The women look up.

Standing there, in all his glory. He flashes his coolest

smile. They melt. We've seen this before.

SLAM! The door to the bar busts open, revealing:

80.

HANNAH.

She's dripping wet from the rain, looking almost wild.

She scans the room, quickly, searching for...

JACOB.

She spots him, marches straight to him.

For the first time, he looks like a deer in the

headlights.

She grabs him. Kisses him. A long, deep, almost angry

kiss. She pulls back.

Do you remember me?

Yes.

Do you still think I'm attractive?

Yes.

Do you still want to take me home?

Yes.

Hannah NODS, takes his hand.

Let's go.

She leads him out of the bar. We STAY WITH the WOMEN

Jacob had just been introducing himself to.

Slut.

We haven't been here yet. It's exactly what you'd expect

though: an elegant bachelor-pad. Modern furniture.

Sleek. Everything just right. Jacob puts an album on

his record player.

81.

This place looks like something

out of a men's magazine.

Is that a compliment?

I'm not sure.

Music starts playing: "As Tears Go By" by the Stones.

I like this song.

I thought you would.

Drink?

Yes, please.

Jacob pours two nice glasses of SCOTCH, neat. Brings

them (and the bottle) over towards the couch.

He pats the couch. Hannah nods, walks over, sits down.

Cheers.

Cheers.

They CLINK. Jacob takes a sip. Hannah downs hers. She

holds out her glass for a refill.

Jacob raises a brow, pours her another. This time she

HOLDS HER NOSE as she downs it. As soon as she finishes

choking...

So is this how it normally works?

What?

How you woo a woman? You take

them back to your granite-

countered bachelor pad, put on the

perfect song, and make them a

drink?

82.

Yes. That's how it normally

works.

Hannah NODS, grabs the bottle, takes a swig.

And then you sleep with them?

Yes.

So that's what happens next? We

sleep together?

At some point, yes, I was under

the impression that was your plan.

She takes a deep breath, admits:

I'm very nervous.

I'm getting that.

I know at the bar I seemed

confident, but I was more just

soaking wet and cold and trying to

be dramatic.

Jacob LAUGHS. He actually LAUGHS.

You're adorable.

Hannah SNAPS, already tipsy.

No! Not adorable! Sexy! R-rated

sexy! Because I know what happens

next in the PG-13 version of

tonight: I get really drunk, and

I pass out, and you cover me with

a blanket, and kiss my forehead,

and nothing happens... but that's

not why I'm here!

I'm here to bang the hot guy from

the bar who hit on me.

83.

I don't think people say `bang'

anymore.

I do. We're going to bang. I'm

finally going to do something

exciting and dangerous and Liz can

blow me!

Hannah shakes her hands out, pumping herself up.

Okay, okay, this is happening.

Take off your shirt.

What?

I need to stop thinking. Take off

your shirt.

Jacob SHRUGS, stands, unbuttons his shirt and takes it

off. He's ripped.

Holy crap.

She pokes a finger at his abs.

It's like you're photo-shopped.

Now take off yours.

No way! Not with all that

happening...

She motions casually at his abs.

So... do you prefer to do it here

or in the bedroom?

In the bedroom is preferable.

Hannah stands, a girl on a mission.

84.

Good. Let's go there.

Meanwhile Cal, beaten up and soaking wet from the rain,

ENTERS. He looks to his usual table, in need of a

friend's company.

But Jacob isn't there.

CUT BACK TO:

Hannah lies on her back in the dim light. Jacob is on

top of her, shirtless. They're making out, gently.

This pillow is amazing. It forms

perfectly to the shape of my head.

I'm glad you like it.

They resume kissing. After a beat, she pulls back again.

Wait, are these those foam pillows

from Brookstone?

Off his look...

They are, aren't they!? I always

wondered who actually buys them!

You do! The hot guy from the bar

buys them! Of course!

She shakes her head, amazed. Gathers herself.

Sorry, let's proceed.

Jacob smiles, goes to kiss her... she pulls back again.

You don't have one of those

ridiculous massage chairs, do you?

85.

No.

Oh. My. God! You totally do!

I do.

She STARTS LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY. It's infectious.

How much did it cost?

Five thousand doll--

That DOUBLES HER OVER, hysterical. Jacob starts laughing

with her... really laughing. We can tell: this is

different for him. He likes her.

We watch him as he realizes that. As he processes it.

We watch him look at Hannah.

Hair in her face: drunk, laughing, completely amazing.

And then... Jacob does the most unexpected thing:

Do me a favor. Ask me a question

about myself.

What? No! I don't want to know

anything about you.

C'mon, one question.

Okay, fine, but then we bang.

Absolutely. Now, come on, I'll

answer anything. You can ask me

about my job, or past

What's your mom like?

86.

The question takes him by surprise. He hesitates, then:

Icy... I guess? Not cruel, but

cold. Very cold.

And your father?

He died, long time ago. Left us a

lot of money, which is how I

have...

He motions at his PILLOW.

Stuff like this.

She motions at his abs.

And time for stuff like that?

He LAUGHS.

My dad was the opposite of my mom,

actually...

We PULL BACK as they continue chatting.

TIME PASSES, as one question leads to another, and then

another.

Body language shifts.

-- Soon they're sitting in bed, sharing the Scotch from

the bottle, just talking. Then kissing. Then lying on

their sides, face-to-face, talking some more.

-- Until finally: it's Jacob who passes out. And it's

Hannah who covers him with a blanket, and kisses him on

the forehead, and begins falling in love with him.

CUE MUSIC as we begin a...

MONTAGE. IN ONE CONTINUOUS DOLLY MOVE WE HEAD, FIRST,

TO...

87.

Hannah looks longingly at Jacob's plate of pancakes.

He notices, switches plates.

She smiles. He smiles. God, he's crazy about her.

He looks at the next table, watches a LOVELORN GUY switch

plates with his GIRLFRIEND.

Uh-oh.

DOLLY DOWN the row, HANDS are held between COUPLES, all

entranced by the movie, until we REVEAL:

staring down at his hand, locked with Hannah's. He looks

terrified.

Now it's Hannah who's asleep in bed, and Jacob who stares

at her lovingly. Suddenly, he catches himself.

In a series of COMEDIC JUMP-CUTS, he wrestles with the

implications of what's happening to him.

-- Pacing. A drink. A big drink. Fingers pulling at

his own hair. Hyperventilating. More staring. More

pacing.

And finally, he loses the battle: he tucks Hannah under

a blanket, kisses her forehead, and finally...

Gives in to falling in love with her.

Cal is sitting at the table that once belonged to Jacob.

He suddenly seems very alone.

88.

He looks towards the bar, notices that same SAD SACK

MIDDLE-AGED GUY. Also alone. He picks up his cell.

Tracy sits at a table, FLOWERS off to the side. Her

phone rings. She looks at it, sees it's "Cal." She hits

IGNORE.

PULL BACK to reveal DAVID JACOBWITZ, across from her. He

looks at Tracy and smiles. She smiles back weakly.

The awkward end of a first date. David walks Tracy to

the front door. She's carrying those same flowers.

Awkward beat.

I had fun tonight, Tracy. And I

was wondering if --

David, stop. Look, I had a nice

time, which is a substantial

upgrade from the rest of the...

times I've been having lately.

So, I don't think I'm ready to

start dating but my ex clearly is

and there's a yogurt shop where

they make this eight calorie ice

cream that tastes like a laxative,

so if you'd like to take me there

sometime I guess I wouldn't say

no.

Wow. You know, that's exactly

what I was thinking. It's almost

uncanny.

They LAUGH. This is the moment. Romantic chemistry.

Are they going to kiss? Holy cow. And then...

THE DOOR OPENS. Jessica stands there.

Hello.

Oh, Jessica. Hi. Sorry.

Jessica, this is my work-friend.

89.

He's an accountant named David.

David, this is my baby-sitter,

Jessica. Okay, David, well

everything sounds great.

Spreadsheets.

David smiles knowingly.

I'll see you at work.

He EXITS. Tracy stands there with Jessica, awkward.

INSIDE THE DOOR

Robbie sneaks down the stairs. From a kneeling position,

he can hear and see everything.

So... How was dinner?

It was just for work.

It's a pretty dress.

Oh, thanks.

Tracy reaches for her purse, awkwardly.

So how much do I owe yo--

Did you know your kids are the

only ones I baby-sit for who

always want to stay awake so they

can see their dad when he gets

home. I mean, they fight with

everything they have to keep their

eyes open so they can hear what

Dad had for dinner, or how he

liked the movie. Lot of kids want

to stay awake for Mom -- and your

kids always want to see you, don't

get me wrong -- but not a lot wait

up for Dad. Maybe it's because

he's good, and he's kind, and he's

decent.

90.

What are you talking abo--

Batshit crazy.

She walks out the door. Tracy looks confused.

Jessica?

Jessica turns, explodes?

I DON'T WANT YOUR SLUTTY MONEY!

She storms off.

Jessica!

But she's gone. Tracy SIGHS ("what the hell was that")

and CLOSES the door.

Tracy locks the door and leans against it... processing

what Jessica just said about Cal.

She puts the FLOWERS down on the table, and heads into

the kitchen.

at top of the stairs, regarding the flowers.

CUE MUSIC. Robbie rides his bike down the street. He's

got Tracy's FLOWERS nestled in his handlebars.

Jessica ENTERS in a huff, goes right toward a drawer in

her dresser. She pulls out a CAMERA.

IN QUICK CUTS

we watch as she: Sets it on her dresser. Hits the

timer. Steps back. Drops her clothes to the floor.

91.

Prints a PHOTO from her camera. And places it in an

"Cal Weaver." With a heart. She stares at the envelope

for a beat.

Just then: HER DOORBELL RINGS.

Jessica jumps, started. She quickly puts the envelope in

a drawer and heads for the door.

She opens the front door. Sitting on her stoop:

The same flowers that David Jacobowitz gave Tracy sit out

front. She looks at the note. It reads: "Just give me

a chance, love David J" but the "David J." has been

crossed out and replaced with "Robbie."

She shakes her head, takes the flowers, closes the door.

MUSIC CONTINUES as we spy the Weaver family through their

windows: Robbie plays video games in his room. Molly

watching her show in hers. Tracy in the kitchen.

We MOVE DOWN the house, and OUTSIDE, where we discover:

Cal in stealth mode, tending to his backyard. He

fertilizes, trims and waters. All under cover of night.

TRACY (O.S.)

Kids! Ice cream!

Cal looks into the living room. Tracy has brought out

ice cream: a carton with three spoons. The kids race

down the stairs, join her, and start eating. Laughing.

We take in the real-time TABLEAU:

Cal's wife and children -- his family -- inside. Cal:

watching them from the outside, looking in.

It's touching. It's complicated. It's horribly painful.

INSIDE... Tracy looks at her kids, thinks of something.

She steps into the KITCHEN, closes the door, and DIALS

her phone. Cal leans toward the window, suspicious.

OUTSIDE... Cal's phone rings. He jumps to silence it.

92.

Hello?

Hi, Cal.

Silence. Cal is looking at her inside. She has no idea.

So... I'm in the basement. I'm

trying to get the water heater

working `cause the pilot's out and

I don't know how to relight it.

Obviously Cal sees she's not in the basement.

I'm sorry to bother you, I just...

what do I do?

Cal lowers the phone, looks at her, hesitates. Then:

It's fine, it's fine. I'm glad

you called. Here: I'll walk you

through it.

Do you see the little grey door?

Yeah.

Pull it down.

She pantomimes this in the kitchen.

Okay, it's down.

Now, you see the red button? I

wrote `push' on it?

I got it.

Push. Now turn that to the right

and stick the match in.

Oh, there it goes!

93.

Good. Now just close the door and

you're good to go.

Silence. The charade is over. Now what?

Well, thanks, Cal. I...

appreciate your help.

No, anytime. Call anytime with

stuff like that.

Talk to you later?

Yeah. And... thanks again.

Cal HANGS up. He takes one final look back at his wife

as the sprinklers go off in the backyard and douse him.

Cal sits on his little couch, between Robbie and Molly.

Molly is once again absorbed in High School Musical.

Cal looks depressed. Robbie doesn't look much better.

Nanna's coming over tonight. You

guys haven't seen her in a while.

Wanna stay for dinner?

Sure.

Your mom's working till five,

we'll have to tell her.

(off their silence)

What do you guys want to do today?

(not looking up)

High School Musical.

Well, there's a shocker.

She goes back into her trance.

She still won't talk to you?

94.

Not if that show's on.

No, I mean, Mom.

Oh, no. Just hellos and goodbyes

when we pass you guys off.

What happened?

Beyond your pay-grade, buddy.

Cal looks pained.

I will say this though: I got

close. We were laughing. Talking

about old times, all the things we

used to do...

His eyes drift to the TV. It's the timeless GOLF SCENE

from High School Musical II. A LIGHT BULB goes on.

Hey. Get your coat.

Robbie smiles, runs off. Cal turns to Molly, REMOTE in

hand.

Baby? I'm gonna have to turn off

the show.

No!

I have to --

NOOOO!

I'm turning it off --

NOOOOOOOOOOO!

He just does it! He turns the TV off. Silence. Molly

turns towards him, stares. A long, scary, beat. Then:

95.

(free at last)

Thank you.

Cal KISSES her, jumps up from the couch.

Cal talks to a SALESMAN. Robbie and Molly bounce around,

excited.

Cal talks to a different SALESMAN. Robbie and Molly

extend a MEASURING TAPE across the ground, assisting.

Cal rents a TRUCK.

Cal picks up materials. As he rounds a corner, he runs

into... BERNIE.

Oh, hey, Cal.

Bernie.

So how've you --

Bernie: I'd love to catch up, but

I'm doing something at the old

house tonight and I'm in a bit of

a rush so... yeah. Thanks again

for the cologne.

Cal takes off.

Molly points out her three favorite DAY LABORERS, Cal

hires them.

96.

Some kind of construction is going on back there.

Cal's cell phone RINGS. We go --

with JACOB on his. He's waiting outside a LIQUOR STORE

in his car.

Hello?

Hey, Cal.

Oh. My. God. It's alive.

I'm sorry. I know I've been out

of circulation.

You abandoned me at my time of

need.

I've been a little... things have

gotten a bit... I met a woman.

I bet you did.

No, I mean, I've been spending a

lot of time with her. This woman.

One woman.

Okay, whatever.

Actually, tonight... I'm going to

meet her mother.

Whoa!!!! Look at you! You do

realize you might actually have to

answer a question or two about

yourself?

97.

Yes, I realize that, asshole.

Hannah comes out of the wine store, hops over the car.

Jacob can't help but smile: wow, he's REALLY into her.

Gotta go. Grab a beer next week?

You've got my number.

Hey. Good for you, by the way.

Thanks.

Cal HANGS up, LAUGHS to himself, and gets back to work.

Tracy pulls up to her house. As she pulls in she notices

Robbie. He's standing outside the front door in a

tuxedo... a shit-eating grin on his face.

She SIGHS ("what now?") and parks the car.

Meanwhile. Claire is putting away laundry. She throws

some underwear in Jessica's bottom drawer.

Notices something. An envelope. It's addressed to Cal

Weaver. Curiosity piqued, she picks it up. Looks

inside. Almost faints.

Big Bernie sits in a recliner, watching football and

drinking a cold one. Jessica lies on the floor, doing

homework.

Claire ENTERS, ashen. Zombie-like, she hands Bernie the

envelope. Jessica looks up, sees it.

No!!!!

She jumps, but it's too late.

98.

Staring at the picture. We don't see it, but we get the

point: it's a father's worst nightmare.

Bernie, dazed, slides the pictures back into the

envelope. He looks at the envelope again.

Cal's name. A heart.

BACK TO SCENE

Daddy?

Bernie puts a hand up. He can't speak. He marches out

the door. From inside we hear a car SCREECH AWAY.

Realizing. She grabs a second set of keys.

Jessica runs into a second car. Races after her father.

Meanwhile. Tracy approaches Robbie. Not only is he

wearing a tuxedo, he's carrying a bunch of SCARVES.

Tracy LAUGHS.

Baby! What are you wearing!?

Dad's here.

Tracy's face drops.

I have to blindfold you.

What is this? What is he doing?

99.

Relax, Mom. He's your husband,

not Al Queda. You'll make it out

alive.

She can't help but smile. She kneels down, allowing

Robbie to BLINDFOLD HER from behind.

He ties a SCARF around her eyes. Then ANOTHER at a

different angle, double-knots it. Then ANOTHER!

Okay, we're good, let's do this.

Meanwhile. There's no expression on Bernie's face. It's

frightening. He looks down at passenger seat. At the

ENVELOPE bearing Cal's address.

He RACES through a light. A HORN blares behind him.

Jessica is the one BLARING THE HORN, crying and panicked.

She too RACES through the same light.

Robbie leads a blindfolded Tracy into the backyard. She

looks like a zombie with all the scarves over her face.

We see what she is not yet privy to.

ON THE BACKYARD

Cal's Shangri-La has been transformed: the yard holds a

FULL-BLOWN MINIATURE GOLF HOLE, windmill and all.

Cal stands behind it all, in a tux.

Hi, T.

Can I take these off, please?

Almost. Kids?

100.

Robbie CUES music (which will play throughout this

scene). Molly, in a PARTY DRESS, carries a glass of

champagne to Tracy and puts it in her hand.

Twenty-five years ago, Cal Weaver

saw Tracy Boyle for the first

time, walking the halls of

Woodside Middle School --

Cal: are you seriously doing this

in front of the kids?

If it goes bad I'm supposed to

take Molly upstairs and put the TV

on loud.

Tracy SIGHS, giving up.

Well, might as well wait for your

daughter.

She's right next to you, T.

No, your other daughter.

Huh? Just then:

VOICE (O.S.)

Hello?

From inside the house steps out...

HANNAH.

Nanna!

Hi, Daddy.

WTF! And right behind her... JACOB. Holding a bottle of

wine and smiling like an idiot. Everyone freezes.

Cal?

101.

What the hell are you doing here?

What the hell are you doing here?

Wait, you two know each other?

Hi, Nanna.

Wait, what's going on?

Hey, Nanna.

Hey, Robbie.

Hey, Nanna.

Hey, cutie.

WHAT THE HELL IS A NANNA!?

It's me, I couldn't pronounce

Hannah when I was little -- wait,

so how do you know my dad?

Oh, God.

I'M NOT UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S GOING

ON HERE!

Dad, this is my boyfriend, Jacob.

No. No. No. No.

102.

I want to see the boyfriend!

Can someone please take this off?

HOW THE HELL DO YOU HAVE A 24-YEAR-

OLD DAUGHTER!?

I WAS SEVENTEEN! SHE WAS OUR

SENIOR YEAR HICCUP! IT'S WHY WE

GOT MARRIED SO YOUNG!

WHY DIDN'T YOU EVER TELL ME THAT?

YOU NEVER LET ME TALK ABOUT MY

CHILDREN!

So you two, like, really know each

other?

No way -- you and her... no way.

End it, now.

Daddy!!!

Well, that's not going to happen.

Well, then I'm going to murder

you.

DAD!

(down to two scarves)

Will someone please take this

goddamn thing off me!

Robbie, take the goddamn thing off

your mother!

(then, looking up)

Bernie?

103.

SLAM! A body flies into Cal and knocks him OUT OF FRAME.

It's Bernie! Behind him...

JESSICA runs after her father, SCREAMING:

Daddy, no!

Is that Jessica?

BAM! Bernie lands a solid right into Cal's jaw.

Daddy!

Daddy!

What's happening?

Bernie is pummeling Cal.

I LET HER BABY-SIT FOR YOU, YOU

SICK SON OF A BITCH! SHE'S

SEVENTEEN!

Jacob dives in. Tries to pull Bernie off. Bernie NAILS

Jacob with an UPPERCUT!

Jacob!

Bernie, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE

TALKING ABOUT!

Bernie picks up a WINDMILL from the miniature GOLF

COURSE, readies to bash it over Cal's head. Jessica

throws herself on Cal.

Daddy, stop!

This breaks Bernie's trance. He hesitates.

He didn't do anything. He doesn't

even know.

104.

Know what?

Know what?

Robbie, please get this off me!

(struggling with it)

I'm TRYING!

He doesn't even know that I'm in

love with him!

Robbie stops, turns.

With who?

(pointing at Cal)

With him.

Are you pointing at me?

Are you pointing at him?

Who is she pointing at!?

Wait: my dad is the older guy

you've been seeing?

I knew it.

He gets ready to pummel some more. Jessica grabs him.

He doesn't even know about the

dirty pictures I made for him.

You made him dirty pictures? Oh

God.

105.

Robbie looks to Cal. He's angry, jealous, and broken-

hearted all at once.

You're the one? You're the one

she...

(then, furious)

You stole my soulmate.

Wait: Jessica is your soulmate?

VOICE (O.S.)

I'm sorry, is Tracy home?

Everyone turns: DAVID JACOBOWITZ stands in the doorway.

He's holding up a SWEATER in his right hand.

You left your sweater in my car

the other night.

Who are you?

David Jacobowitz.

David Jacobowitz!

David Jacobowitz!?

Is this a bad time --

WHACK!!! Jacob LEVELS David Jacobowitz with a right

hook.

Jacob!

You know how much misery you've

put this poor bastard through!?

Before Jacob can finish, Cal LEVELS Jacob.

Stay the hell away from my

daughter.

106.

Jacob JUMPS on Cal. David jumps on Jacob. Bernie tries

to pull them apart.

Jessica finally gets the blindfold off Tracy. The women

and children watch the battle in horror.

Cal, Jacob, Bernie, and David Jacobowitz sit side-by-side

on the miniature golf hole, bloodied but still.

REVEAL: TWO POLICE OFFICERS standing in the center of

the yard. One of them finishes writing in a pad.

Well, okay. That should about do

it.

(to his partner)

What do you think?

The other cop SHRUGS. The first cop, thinks, then:

Look, I'm just gonna write

domestic disturbance reported but

all clear, okay? `Cause honestly,

I don't even know what to put down

here.

Thank you, Officer.

He nods, walks to the door. Stops there.

Just... simmer down, okay? We all

have arguments, but if you're

gonna fight -- just do it inside.

Keep it in the family, okay?

Jacob SNARFS down a laugh. Cal glares at him.

I'll kill you.

The cops look at Cal, at each other, SHRUG, and EXIT.

107.

ON THE YARD

Awkward silence. Our whole cast is there: disheveled

and bloodied. The place looks like a hurricane has hit.

A miniature golf hole torn to shreds.

Bernie turns to Jessica.

Let's go. Now.

She NODS. Looks back at Cal.

I'm so sorry --

NOW!

And that's that. Robbie runs to the driveway, looks:

as Jessica runs after her father, trying to apologize.

But he won't even look at her. They get in their

respective cars, drive off.

Jacob approaches Cal.

Don't.

Cal turns to Hannah.

This man is a lowlife and a

(under her breath)

Oh, that's ironic.

Cal whips around.

I'm sorry, what?

Tracy doesn't push it. Cal turns back to Hannah.

108.

You may not be able to see it, but

I have. Over and over again. You

are not to see him any more.

Dad, c'mon, I'm not going to stop

seeing him.

Cal turns away.

Well then I don't have anything

else to say to you.

GET THE HELL OUT OF MY HOUSE!

shocked.

BACK TO SCENE

Cal, stop being unreasona--

I said: GET THE HELL OUT OF MY

HOUSE!

IT'S NOT YOUR HOUSE ANYMORE, CAL!

AND YOU MADE DAMN SURE OF THAT

DIDN'T YOU, SWEETHEART!?

This time it's Tracy whose face registers shock. Hannah

takes Jacob's hand, pulls him away.

(one last try)

Cal, c'mon --

But Cal won't even look at him.

Goodbye, Nanna.

109.

Goodbye, cutie.

They EXIT. Cal lets them go, then grabs his things.

She's all yours, David.

Ouch.

Nice.

Before he goes, Cal stops in front of Robbie.

Go big or go home, right, buddy?

Robbie looks up at him, cold.

Go home, Dad.

Cal NODS, EXITS.

CUE: John Mayer's "Who Says."

1) ROBBIE, at school. His spirit is crushed. He looks

at his CONTACT LIST, thinks, and DELETES JESSICA.

2) at home, grounded and sad.

3) trying to get HANNAH to make a phone call to her

father... she won't.

4) at her office, finally taking down the picture of her

and Cal. And speaking of Cal...

110.

Cal sits back at his usual table. This isn't "Cool Cal,"

the Jacob disciple. No, this is "Sad Mess Cal." He's

grown a patchy beard. He's wearing a ratty sweatsuit.

He's drinking, once again, vodka-cranberry out of a wimpy

red straw. It's pathetic. A WAITRESS APPROACHES.

Can I get you another?

What time is it?

2:30. In the afternoon.

2:30 would have been sufficient

but I appreciate the judgment,

Cocktail Waitress.

Yes, another drink would be grand.

She EXITS.

Cal feels bad for that one. As she re-approaches:

That was uncalled for. Sorry for

being a dick.

JACOB (O.S.)

Ah, it's okay, I deserved it.

Standing there. As always, he looks perfectly put

together. He takes in Cal.

It's a nice sweatsuit, Cal.

What do you want?

Can I sit?

I don't know, can you?

111.

Okay, are we going to be mature

about this, or act like children?

`Are we going to be mature or act

like children?'

Okay, so like children then. Move

over.

Jacob SLIDES in.

I'd like to talk.

You still seeing my daughter?

Yes.

Then I have nothing to say to you.

Cal.

Cal, look at me.

Cal looks. Jacob still has that power over him.

You been hanging out here a lot?

Sometimes.

Must be missing a lot of work.

I have a lot of vacation days.

Some vacation.

I hate the beach... you've got a

lot of nerve coming here --

Just then, the WAITRESS re-approaches. Delivers Cal's

drink. They wait her out. She EXITS.

112.

You want a sip?

No, she probably spit in it.

Jacob NODS as Cal pushes the drink away.

Your kids miss you.

You're hanging out with my kids,

fantastic! You can teach Robbie

how to objectify women, he'll love

that.

His eighth grade graduation is

next week. You coming?

Of course I'm coming.

Well you haven't exactly been

around for him, Cal.

He's not my biggest fan right now.

Oh, that's a good excuse --

Alright, man-whore, if your

lecture on parental responsibility

is almost done --

I love her, Cal.

Cal looks up.

I've never been in love before.

Honestly, I've never even been in

`like' before.

I never got it. I saw people in

love -- I saw weakness. I heard

them say the things they said, and

do the things they do, it all just

seemed so... so pathetic.

113.

She's my perfect combination of

everything, Cal.

Cal looks up at Jacob. He smiles, gently.

I know you. I know what you are.

You are not good enough for my

daughter. And you will never have

my permission nor my approval.

Jacob stands.

I'll see you at graduation.

He EXITS. Once more, Cal is alone. Just as he wants it.

A small MIDDLE-SCHOOL AMPHITHEATER. About 150 people

fill the crowd of an intimate middle school graduation.

Tracy, Molly, and Hannah sit in the front row. Jessica

sits with her family a few rows away. All look nice.

MANY ROWS BACK --

Sits Cal, sandwiched between RANDOM SPECTATORS. Cal is

now shaven and well-dressed but he looks miserable.

His eyes brighten for a moment as he notices...

AN EMPTY SEAT between Tracy and Hannah. He leans

forward, are they saving it for him? But just then...

Jacob arrives. Kisses Hannah and takes "Cal's" seat.

Cal looks nauseous.

We WATCH the ceremony for a moment. The PRINCIPAL labors

through her introduction...

VOICE (V.O.)

... and now, to introduce the

first student speaker: our very

own English teacher Kate Thompson!

Cal's former conquest steps onto stage.

114.

AHEAD OF CAL

Tracy looks away, clearly uncomfortable at the teacher's

presence. She accidentally catches Cal's eye. Awkward.

Our next speaker is not only the

class salutatorian, but he's also

one of the most...

Spirited... young men, I've ever

had the pleasure of teaching.

Ladies and gentlemen: Robbie

Weaver.

Robbie takes the stage to APPLAUSE. This is not the same

kid we've come to love. There's something different in

his face. He's been broken. He spots JESSICA.

(a bit monotone)

Thank you, Mrs. Thompson.

Welcome, Class of 2011.

I wasn't really sure what I wanted

to talk about today. Mrs.

Thompson said it might be good to

talk about growing up and getting

older and stuff. So I guess I'll

talk about that.

Cal watches, concerned. Where's his son?

I grew up a lot this year, I

think. I used to think that

growing up meant really growing.

Like getting taller and bigger.

But now I think that growing up

just makes you smaller. Your

dreams get smaller, and what you

want gets smaller...

(beat, then)

I grew an inch and a half this

year, but I feel a lot smaller.

Cal sits forward, getting increasingly concerned.

I was in love. And I know that

makes parents laugh because I'm

only thirteen but whatever, I was.

115.

I believed that there was one true

love for everyone, and if you

fought for that person, your one

true love would always work out.

But that's not how it works. It

sounded good when I was younger,

but... it's just not how it works.

There's no such thing as one true

love for everyo--

CAL (O.S.)

Stop!

Robbie turns. Cal is STANDING in the middle of the

crowd. Everyone turns to look at him.

Dad?

Hi.

(awkward, to crowd)

Hi, everyone.

Silence. No one knows what to do. Cal is suddenly

really uncomfortable.

May I have a word with my son?

It'll just take a second.

Cal tries to extricate himself from his row. He steps

over people, squeezes by people, almost trips.

Finally clear, he gathers himself, and tries to keep his

dignity as he marches down the aisle -- past his family.

Robbie comes to the front of the stage, bends down.

What are you doing?

I don't know. What are you doing?

Robbie's eyes well up with tears.

I was wrong, Dad. There's no such

thing as --

Cal turns toward the crowd, announces:

116.

My son's graduation speech sucks.

GASPS from the crowd.

Now standing, alone, front and center in front of an

entire eighth grade graduation ceremony.

He looks behind him at the panel of TEACHERS. MRS.

THOMPSON discreetly gives Cal the finger.

In fairness, I don't know where he

was going but I think we can all

agree it was heading in a pretty

depressing direction. And I

basically wrote it for him. I

mean, I didn't literally write it

but I sure as hell influenced it,

and the kid's already a spitting

image of his mother and I'll be

damned if this is what he's going

to get from me.

People squirm, uncomfortable. This is a train wreck.

My son -- not him, my actual son --

he believes in grand romantic

gestures. He believes that people

have soulmates. And we always

want to tell our thirteen-year-

olds that they're wrong, that `one

day you'll understand, young man.'

But maybe it should be the other

way around.

He looks at Tracy, out in the crowd.

I met my soulmate when I was

fifteen years old. Our first

date, we went for ice cream.

After, my dad started teasing me

about my `first date' the way dads

do. And I told him: `stop making

a big deal, Dad. I'm going to go

on lots of dates with plenty of

girls.' That was the first time I

ever lied to my father.

117.

I met my soulmate when I was

fifteen years old. And I have

loved her with everything I have

for every minute, of every day,

ever since she let me buy her that

first mint chip ice cream. I have

loved her through the birth of our

three perfect children, and I have

loved her even as I've hated her --

only married couples can truly

understand that one. And I don't

know what will wind up happening

with us -- I don't, Robbie, I'm

sorry I can't give you that -- but

I promise you this: I will never

stop trying. When you find `the

one' you never give up trying...

and I love you, my amazing boy,

for reminding me of that.

Robbie hugs his father as the crowd reacts. Cal kisses

his son on the head, then motions towards the microphone.

Robbie grabs it with newfound gusto and announces:

I still love you, Jessica! I've

loved you since the first time you

changed my sister's diaper! I've

loved you since...

The crowd reacts (LAUGHS, CHEERS, etc.) as Robbie

continues. Cal stands back and smiles. His boy is back.

The ceremony is over. Robbie heads over to his family.

They hug him, kiss him. Cal approaches Hannah and Jacob.

Hi, Nanna.

Daddy.

He smiles at her, adoring.

My perfect girl.

He kisses her forehead, turns to Jacob.

118.

I already ordered a gun. I'm not

kidding. I ordered a Colt .45 on

a shady internet site, I can show

you the receipt. If you hurt her,

I am prepared to shoot you in the

face.

Cal, I'm not going to --

Shut up, Jacob.

Jacob shuts up.

Wow. I like that.

Jacob smiles, shakes hands with Cal. Cal notices:

Is that a new shirt?

Hannah took me to the Gap. It's

actually not as bad as I thought.

Seriously?

Of course not, Cal. It's the Gap.

I got this at Nordstrom's.

And like that... order is restored in the universe.

OVER TO ROBBIE

Who approaches Jessica.

It was nice of you to come.

I wouldn't have missed it.

Awkward.

So, how are things with your dad?

119.

Strained. I took a summer

internship up at Stanford, gonna

head up there early. Figure it

can't hurt to get out of his line

of sight for a while.

Yeah, probably a good idea.

You were a good baby-sitter,

Jessica. I'm sorry if I made you

uncomfortable.

He holds out his hand, to shake, formally.

Wait: I thought you weren't

giving up.

I'm not. But I figure: you like

my dad, and one day I'll look like

my dad, so I'll just come for you

then.

Jessica smiles.

It's a good plan.

She looks over her shoulder, reaches into her purse.

Until then: a little graduation

gift. To help get you through

high school.

She hands him something in an ENVELOPE: the same type of

envelope she once used for...

Robbie peeks inside. His eyes BUG OUT. Jessica kisses

him, sweetly, on the cheek.

You take care, Robbie.

Robbie watches her go. Love-struck once more. Cal steps

up next to his son.

You okay, buddy?

120.

I am now, Dad. I am now.

Robbie runs off to join his friends. Cal smiles.

TRACY (O.S.)

I'm terrified of what's going to

become of him once he hits

puberty.

Cal turns, Tracy has been watching.

We might have to lock him up.

Tracy smiles. Cal walks over toward her.

You gave a good eighth grade

graduation speech.

I've been working on it for thirty

years, so...

She LAUGHS, then... quiet.

Do you think we can ever come back

from all this, Cal?

I don't know. I'd like to try

though. I know I'd like to try.

She nods, thinking.

Things are just so messed up. And

it's been such a strange year.

I've been in such a strange place.

And we have all these problems, so

many problems I've lost count, but

at the end of the day, I mean, the

only thing I know --
