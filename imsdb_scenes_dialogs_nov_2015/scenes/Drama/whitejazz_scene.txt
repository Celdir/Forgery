Ruiz turns `caught-me' pink...I nod to Junior: split `em.

Playing adjoining hotel rooms like sweat boxes.

Junior shoves Ruiz through the inner-door connecting the

rooms. Sanderline giggles. Close the door behind them. Sit

down inches from Sanderline, change my tone:

Instant quiet.

Sanderline staying silent...

-phone rings. Sanderline flinches for the second time.

I stand, step, answer it:

Mild shock. Catalogue potential "who's"...

6   INT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - BRADLEY'S OFFICE - MORNING           6

Bethune leaps like a lapdog, hits the power.

Bradley picks up a newspaper:

Bob and Tom nod, pat my back on the way out: proud uncles

lending support before Dad drops the hammer. Door closes. I

stand, step to the window, big Pro-Mex protest below: Geeks

and placards: `BASEBALL IS AS AMERICAN AS THE TRAIL OF TEARS!

I wave it all off:

-and Bradley drops his bomb: Coroner's file. I stare...guess

the contents...try to keep my heart rate in-check...

Bradley slides the morning paper over. Front page: `Candidate

Diskant Hears The Hue and Cry of The Underclass...' The photo

shows a smiling Diskant, rolled shirt-sleeves, in the middle     *

of a sea of LA Immigrants, all smiling back.                     *

I stare back. Feel myself getting fitted for strings...

Bradley waves me out. I intentionally drag my badge back

across the desk, scratching his Mahogany heirloom.               *

12   EXT. LOW RENT OFFICE BUILDING, EAST LA - NIGHT            12

Junior in the backseat, penning in a steno, mouthing

something to himself.

Head down, scribbling mid-sentence, makes me wait a beat.

Junior's look practiced in a mirror: clicks the pen, slides

the steno away.

Bait him, see if he bites.

13   INT. LOW RENT FUCK-TEL ROOM - SAME MOMENT                    13

Quiff nervous but cooing, dick out, on Diskant's thigh.

Junior just as nervous...reloading a camera.

A baffled moment as the comment registers.

Diskant finally speaks: marble-mouthed. Pushes Quiff away:

Don't waste a second: grab Diskant by the hair, narrate his

immediate future.

Diskant rips his head free. Rage. Blood from his mouth.         *

Scanning the room, sizing up the situation, then:               *

17   EXT. 1284 SOUTH TREMAINE, MAGDALENA RESIDENCE - LATE NIGHT 17

And presumed what?

I could give a shit. I just want to

this case to get a quick burial.

I'll bet. Who made the call?

Some old broad heard an `argument'

and buzzed Wilshire Station.                *

Where's the family?

The wife and daughter were in Santa

Barbara. Just got back.

At 2 AM?                                    *

The Wife said she got into a fight          *

with her Parents, left ASAP.                *

Why wasn't Hector with `em?                 *

What do you think they were                 *

fighting about? Santa Barbara Wasps         *

don't fancy dope-pushing Wetbacks.

What about the Son?                         *

Tommy. Make him your #1 suspect.

Why's that?                                 *

He's got a mean streak. And he and          *

Hector had been at each others

throats for months. Have Tommy              *

picked up. He likes to loaf at              *

those nigger jazz joints in Watts.          *

18   INT. MAGDALENA RESIDENCE - MOMENTS LATER                     18

-cut into the crazy:

The Six-Pack crosses to confer.

Roam. A hallway. Junior the grim-faced professional, He's got

that damn steno out, scribbling like he's on a deadline.

He's hovering over a lake of blood, drag marks originating in

that lake lead out to the garage. Junior sees me. See him

startle, then jut his tough-guy chin on reflex:

Pull Junior aside, impart the following tightly:

I want to bounce his head off the wall. I continue my tour

instead. Follow the blood-trail out into the garage where it   *

ends in another smaller lake of blood.

Continue the tour. Kitchen. Two Dobermans, shot dead. Feature

matching bullet wounds right between their eyes -- yell to      *

the Officer with the Biddie:                                    *

As he pokes his head around the corner:

Examine the wounds closer. Catch myself petting the deceased

pooches. To Junior:

22   INT. CLUB ALABAM - DAWN                                     22

Doorman escort the bewildered, strong-arm the belligerent.      *

Almost 6 AM and the club is still half full.

Press on, scan the stage: A Bebop trio toils over an Erroll

Garner tune as a beautiful black girl sings in a satin soft

lilt. This whispering falsetto that makes your hair stand on

end. I stop and listen. Get my only smile of the day from       *

her. Smile back because her voice reminds me to.

Hear beer bottles rattle behind and break. Turn. Squeeze that

smile into a sneer, stare down this massive BARTENDER.          *

The bartender glowers, grabs a bottle, pours, hands the size    *

of catcher's mitts. He slides the glass. I sip.                 *

He vanishes behind a stained curtain. Feel those voodoo         *

stares from behind...and I switch the scotch glass to my left   *

hand as nonchalant as possible. Bartender reappears, motions

me back. I follow. Backstage. I see a figure stretched prone,

ice-pack pressed to his face, rolled reefer between his lips.

Only as I get closer do I see the badly swollen black eye. He

looks up at me. A voice like sand-paper left out in the sun:    *

Lester hands me the reefer, take it, toke geeky, belch smoke.

Lester takes it back, draws deep.

Now watch Lester's attitude improve toot sweet:

He spurts smoke, sits up like a shot, beams.                    *

Hallelujah.

What time did he show up?

Around four. Him and these Pachucos         *

poppin' switchblades like punks.

The only thing that was keepin' him         *

`untouched' was Hector...                   *

Is he really dead?                          *

There's blood all over his house,

seems to belong to him. There's

just no body. Not yet.

I don't feature Tommy for it.               *

How's that? How many times has he           *

been in here, busted you up?

Yeah, but he ain't got the salt             *

to truly take a Man's life.                 *

Especially not Hector's...he was            *

scared of him.                              *

Why?                                        *

`Cuz Hector been whippin' Tommy's           *

ass from the time he could talk.            *

What about the Wife? Beat her too?          *

We used to call that old bitch `the         *

Burglar'...eyes were so black, it           *

looked like she had a mask on.              *

And the daughter? Lucille?                  *

Lester can't quip that one as quick. Tokes. Shaking his head.   *

...Lester tilts his neck back, points to a long keloid scar     *

that stretches across his throat...                             *

23   EXT. UNION STATION BALLROOM - DAY                            23

Koenig flashes that grin again.

My eyes narrow but stay smiling:

Koenig nods, casts his gaze out over the crowd.

Koenig roars this big frightening laugh of his.

Koenig's big laugh again. Moving toward Bradley now. Then

flashbulbs pop-blind. Panic: snapping pix of me? Relief: not

me. Hollywood types: this Buff McMan Meat-type and Her. I go

slack inches from the Press that yesterday wanted to roll in

my guts...but now they're just as entranced with her as I am.

She and McMan Meat continue past as I stare, she answers his

questions for him. I think her eyes see mine. Then I realize

where I'm standing. Bradley waiting. Focused on me and not

her -- God-damned Eunuch. I step over, speak without preface:

-no. We can't risk that. Do you             *

make him for the murderer?

Yeah. Hector's disappearance is

definitely an inside job. That

whole family feels hinky. The

daughter was all bruises and no

tears and Hector's hop-head wife            *

looks part punching bag.

Do you suspect either of the women?         *

According to Wilhite, they were in

Santa Barbara at the time.

Verify that. Where is your partner?

Vouching in evidence at Wilshire

Station.

Keep him on that. He had excellent

ratings as an evidence teacher and          *

I trust him more than you.

Find Tommy Magdalena. Focus

everything on that effort & I want

him apprehended Klein, not killed.

What about Hector? Still missing.

And most likely dead. Find the Son.         *

Stakeout the residence. Put tails

on both the mother and daughter --

I want this investigation working

quietly, and around the clock.

And what do we do if Hector turns           *

up?                                         *

Swallow my sneer. Push through the service doors. Hard.

Headed back toward the kitchen, an exit sign. I pass an

alcove: Her. Alone. Smoke break. Beauty you almost never get

to examine up close. I stop, stammer, she gives me a once-

over, thinks I'm a Reporter...

I fumble for a Chesterfield. She pulls a Zippo slow.

I smile too wide -- fuck. I kill it, try to gather up the

bits of `cool' that shattered with the sophomore smile.

24   INT. WILSHIRE STATION - DAY                                  24

Everything worthwhile.

What did you tell the Watch

Commander upstairs?

That this was a random drug

seizure. I'm not using names and

I'm number coding everything.

A load of interesting stuff too.

I got unregistered fire-arms, more

dope than I've ever seen, and some

mail from business associates that

seems hinky. We should follow up-           *

-here, this one, `Hurwitz Holdings'         *

Hector had some real estate

dealings-

-bag it until Bradley orders us

otherwise.

How do you solve a case when the

evidence is in bags?

You don't. Our job is to find

Tommy.

And why is that out?

I'm making notes separate from-

-I thought we were investigating

Magdalena's disappearance-

-Don't write shit down. What do you         *

need Kid? A little bouncing ball,           *

bottom of the screen?                       *

Magdalena is twenty years dirty

with this Department...do you think         *

a word of that exists on paper?

hand, plastic-cordial, rubbed raw from waiting...                *

We sit at a huge drafting table. I shoot a sidelong to Pete.

Pete hate scowls me: have your fun, Asshole...

Milteer looks at Pete. Pete half-shrugs. Back to me now:

Pete laughs out loud. Milteer goes frigid.

36   EXT. 1284 SOUTH TREMAINE, NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT               36

Still unsure what hit me. Pick-up my gun, clear my nose of

gouting blood, stand, weave: a figure in black, sprinting

away: PEEPER. Wipe away impact-tears, aim, realize my trigger   *

finger is dislocated -- bent back ugly. Tuck the gun use my     *

left hand to pop it back in -- deep growl -- re-aim:

POP-POP-POP. The Peeper pitches. Visible in the streetlight:

a red puff off his right shoulder. Headlights at end of the

block, behind me, come to life now- Baritone of a big V-8.      *

Peeper fighting for balance, keeps running.

I sprint heedless, round the corner: follow a blood-trail,

panting, bleeding my own trail. Lift my eyes to see the

Peeper shoulder through a fence, vanish into a backyard.

Neighborhood mutts yelp a chorus. I cross the street-

-those headlights swerve hard in front of me: Black Buick. I    *

look down in time to watch my knee detonate a quarter-panel.

I bounce off like someone yanked a leash. Crumble-yell. Hands

pick me up. I fight back before I even see at whom I'm

swinging: square-jawed types, eyes hidden by Bureau derbies.    *

Welles Noonan gets out of the passenger-side of the Buick.

Punches me as hard as he can without provocation: nothing to

write home about. My gun clatters to the ground.

Sag under the weight of my own insomnia-fed stupidity.          *

37   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - TIME UNKNOWN                       37

Toss the dress shirt to the floor.

Look from Junior and Koenig to the window behind him --

Bradley steam-rolling our way. To Koenig, conspiratorial:      *

Take the pitcher from him, drop my head, douse myself, the

cold cuts cobwebs. Bradley walks in, imperious. Koenig moves

past -- ice forms between the two.                             *

Koenig closes the door. I refuse to look up at Bradley.

I point to Junior -- happy to play teacher's pet:                *

-rubbing the back of my head where the Peeper bashed me-

Bradley turns to me:

Point to the ever-studious Junior.                             *

Bradley conjures the Roman visage...then slowly opens the      *

door, staring holes in me.                                     *

Junior balks, looks my way: tries to mimic my sneer. I stand   *

and shove him toward the door. His look back at me: Judas.     *

Bradley closes the door behind him.                            *

Bradley walks. Watch him disappear down the hall.

Driving past Glenda's house now. No Corvette. Driving past      *

the Griffith Park `Vampires' set: addicts/crew rolling up

sleeping bags. No Corvette. Pull the address list Dandy

handed me: Talent Domiciles.

Pasadena. Howard's Fuck-Pad supreme: A tudor mansion with

airplane-shaped hedges. A Corvette in the drive. Stop at the

curb. Open shades. Flashes of her. Gathering something. Check

my Hamilton, look up as: KNOCK-KNOCK on my window. Her face,

inches-close. Bags of groceries in her hands and this wry

little smile: watch me kill Hughes's new Dick with kindness.    *

Roll the window down, stay blank-slate. She features my

cuts/bruises. Her quiet, deep voice is like medicine:

My heart jammed up into my throat. Push past it.                *

Drop that coffee cup from the other night into her bag. She's

beat, but bluffs by.

Wilhite rips free. Beet-red.

Junior behind me. Urgent:                                       *

Sucks her steam: she knows I know. Her eyes shoot to Wilhite.   *

footfalls coming hard up the steps, Wilhite reinforcements.     *

-hands on me, ripping/hauling. Bull-rushed back into the hall   *

Wilhite tries to push past. Gut-punch him hard, trying to     *

rupture something. Shove him back into the wall. Drywall

implodes. He squeals/shrieks, seizes his shoulder.            *

Brass knucks gleam, get close, kow him completely.            *

-keep him off balance. Big curveball-                           *

Read it: that stung him...                                      *

Ainge sees me bent on Glenda. Looks past me, past the gun in     *

his face, aims right at Junior.                                  *

Junior fixes me, pulls that steno, starts scribbling openly -- *

I grab it, shred it. Ainge grins at the voodoo between us.     *

-throw his TV at his head: legitimately trying to kill him       *

now and he knows it. Off his chair, crawling.                    *

I grab the shattered tube: throw it again. Big POP inches        *

from Ainge. Angry at myself for missing twice:                   *

-grab Junior, sharp jab him, push him out a door for the         *

second time-                                                     *

-final push with my foot gives me enough room to dead-bolt it    *

behind him. Ainge can't fit under his bed.                       *

Flip the mattress. Teen Tit mags and jack-off socks fly with     *

it. Ainge under pine slats. Panic. I put my foot through,        *

bash his gut -- rip him out from underneath.                     *

Ainge unable to speak, gasping for air. Step to his closet:      *

shred hinges when I open it. Rip the clothes rod down:           *

nothing. Pull shelves from the wall: a Louisville Slugger        *

falls at my feet. I smile. Ainge goes frightwig. Step to him.    *

Pop. The lock snaps. Ease it open...                           *

Look inside. Red steno pads. A small orderly pile. Pull one,   *

thumb it-- blank.                                              *

Hang up. Voices arrive. Hustle to my desk, sit, grab a         *

reverse directory, fake flip through it as Fritz Koenig and    *

two Robbery Blueshirts arrive, seizure bags over their         *

shoulders. I clear sweat and leftover blood with my sleeve,    *

trying to look busy as Koenig sidles up.                       *

Koenig, his knuckles and fingernails caked with blood, pulls   *

a three-pound brick of heroin from the bag.                    *

Scramble a joke to keep Koenig from looking at me too

closely...

Koenig laughs big, re-shoulders the bag.                       *

Then I see the bookcase. Top shelf: Police manuals. Bottom

two shelves: wall-to-wall red steno-pads, all exactly the

same brand. Shock. Step over. Flip through them: tiny,

architect-neat script covers every page. The running dialogue

of a functional fucking freak:

MAGDALENA RESIDENCE. 1284 S. TREMAINE. RECOVERED: MAGDALENA FINANCIAL

RECORDS/LEDGERS. SOME ENTRIES REDACTED. TRANSLATED `HH' INTO

`HURWITZ HOLDINGS' AFTER RECOVERING MAIL. SEEMS SUSPICIOUS. BROUGHT

TO ATTENTION OF KLEIN. BRUSHED OFF. PRESS IN SPITE OF KLEIN'S LAZINESS OR

LACK OF INTEREST.

A hand drawn cock doodled beneath that, then below:

DAVE WEARING FORM-FITTING SHIRT TODAY. HANDSOME. I WANT TO PULL IT-

-drop the steno like it might bite. Pick up another: same

drill.

WELLES NOONAN WILL WIN OUT. KLEIN NOT SKILLED OR SMART ENOUGH TO

DUEL WITH A U.S. ATTORNEY MUCH LESS THE FBI. DEEP ADMIRATION FOR

NOONAN'S CAUSE. HIS PURPOSE IS PURE. DON'T WANT TO GET DRAGGED DOWN

WITH POISON PILL KLEIN. MAKE HIM PAY FOR PATRONIZING ME.

Pick up yet another, hands shaking, turn to the last page:

MAKE KLEIN HURT LIKE I HURT. TRADE HIM. TRADE EVERYTHING. TRADE UP TO

THE BUREAU. THINK OF IT: AGENT RICHARD STEMMONS JR. PROUD-PROUD. 1

DREAM DOWN, 10,000 TO GO!

Now, rifle for that knife. Systemically destroy the place.

Dump the stenos in a trash can, sift for matches, strike,

watch the pads catch and floosh, feed the fire with random

paperwork, sift -- Junior's cock-obsessed doodles scribbled

by the dozen.

Under the bed now, carpet covered in rat-traps. Spring them,

clear a space. A Box: beefcake booty, gay smut mags, gay

classified ads. First-person perspective Polaroids of

Junior's stomach being kissed by the Diskant Quiff and vice-

versa.

Open a massive steamer trunk against a far wall. Arsenal:

handguns, shotguns, a surplus M-1. Dump it, kick contents.

Only interested in that knife.

Not if you had the next hundred

years.

Sanderline Johnson, your links to

Sam Giancana to Mickey Cohen,

extortion, bribes, murder-for-hire.

I'll put you in every pair of cross-

hairs I can find. I'll torch

everything you've ever touched. You

have no idea how deep I run Klein.

And how far I'm willing to go to

fuck you-

-everyone knows I'm a piece-a-shit.

What are you proving? Bradley's the

guy flanking you right now. The guy

who's vulnerable right now.

You're all angles and graft Klein.

Why trust a God damn word that

comes out of your-

-you done anything with the

Magdalena case?

Prelims: drug pusher gone missing,

presumed dead, we're investigat-

-Dealing drugs for 20 years!

Arrested once. Hall a' fame career!

You photographed the head of Narco

in-front of his house...

AND?

Jesus Christ, you need cue cards?

Come after me: you get me. Go after

what I can give you and you get the

LAPD's power-set on a slab.

Noonan stands, firm:

On his way out I speak fast -- the last ace in my deck:

Noonan at the door: please bite-please bite...but he just

smirks, walks out. Real panic now: no ideas on what comes

next. 15 seconds. Door opens again: one of Noonan's deputies

pushes a sheet. Scan it: Federal Witness Agreement. Noonan

back: two cups of coffee. Read it over.

Ignore him. Sign the agreement.

Gulp the coffee back, the burn feels good.

Me watching her...tucks her hair back over his shoulders.

Make her laugh. Swear a thousand silent oaths to protect her.

He face slowly goes dark.

The laughter ebbs, her eyes still shine.

I let the silence take...try not to shatter it with:

She doesn't blanch.

She actually gets closer, I can feel her breath on me.

88   INT. MEG'S HOUSE - EARLY A.M.                                88

Look at Pete. Dark rings, deathbed eyes.

Feature Pete, righteously pissed:

Pete pauses, scoffs, turns back toward Meg's bedroom walks:

Door closes. I flip through Junior's files: the same

architect-neat block printing. Find a Glenda entry:

SUBSEQUENT TO HER FATAL STABBING OF DWIGHT Gillette, MISS BLEDSOE

SECRETED THE MURDER WEAPON WITH GEORGE AINGE. I HAVE ACQUIRED THIS

KNIFE. IT IS A SIX-INCH BLADE WITH A MOTHER-OF-PEARL GRIP WHICH

SUSTAINED RIGHT THUMB AND RIGHT INDEX PRINTS WHICH MATCH ELEVEN

COMPARISON POINTS TO FINGERPRINTS ON FILE FROM MISS BLEDSOE'S 1946

JUVENILE SHOPLIFTING ARREST.

90   EXT. CHAVEZ RAVINE - DAY                                     90

Reporters press. Bradley handles them with ease and aplomb.

-Bradley, this brilliant rebuke:

Then Bradley sees me. His press-friendly face contorts, the

shift startling: if only a flashbulb could've framed it. He

shifts back from snarl to smile...

Ruiz begins his forced/coerced/do-it-or-we'll-fuck-you sob

story as Bradley steps away from the glare. I follow. Get

right on his heels.

Bradley spins back.

Bradley blanches, buckles. I see it. Before he can play

stupid with: `What?'

Bradley removes his glasses, staring at documentation that

dooms both his immediate and distant future...

Slap another file over the one he's reading.

All Bradley can muster is:

Hand him Noonan's business card: dig the big Federal Eagle in

American Blue.

Silence. I smile wide at it. Bradley, scrambling.

Bradley readjusts his glasses.

Bradley's reaction: Feature the angler getting angled.

Bradley says nothing. Then, like a klieg-light, it hits me.

91   INT. MEG'S HOUSE - LATER                                     91

Meg wanders in, dressed for work.

She kisses me on my head. I turn:

Meg walks out. Pete lingers. I'm starting to sour him. Not

smart. He stares. I look up.

A beat. Pete sketches me head to toe.

Pete exhales. Stalks off. I keep scribbling.

Meg's phone blares, I answer it on reflex.

I hear rasp on the other end, hyperventilating, unhinged.

Junior. Jesus.

The phone on the other end seems to break-in half. Hang up,

it rings a beat later. Junior still wanting to spar. Snag the

receiver, rip his shit:

He's got her. Junior. Sick. Evil. My mind cannibalizes itself

with "where-is-she-how-do-I-get-her-back" when:

He doesn't have her. A sigh so big, it steals all my air...

94   INT. 1284 SOUTH TREMAINE - PAST                                94

And like he was waiting for those words: Junior lunges. I

twist to deflect but he's too fast -- feel something sink and

drag in my side. I go down, gouge/groping for my gun. Instant

trauma zaps nerves numb up the arm, fingers failing. Then a

pain like boiling oil moves through my blood.

Look down, SEE: A mother-of-pearl knife hilt in my side, the

business end stuck deep. Junior laughing as I fall to my

knees. He pulls the file from the waist and tosses my .45.

Koenig takes the file, opening it.

Junior, his own .45 pulled, put to my head.

Koenig reads the file's first page, lifts it...a blank page

behind...and behind that one...

Koenig spins back, more blank pages spilling from the file.

-Junior looks: that's all I need. Pull the pig-sticker off my

ankle and corkscrew it into his calf, twisting. Junior bleats

slaughtered-lamb as I reach up a wrench his gun free. Grab

his tie, pull him down as I jut his gun up under his chin and

fire two shots through the top of his head.

Haul him down dead by his tie, turn -- Koenig's gun-hand

flashes to his shoulder. Shoot him twice. He goes down

gargling `fuck'. Stand-up on me sea-legs, bad wobble/weave as

I slowly pull the knife from my side, pocket it. Feel blood

flow saturate my pant leg. This weird wooze overcomes me as I

approach Koenig.

He pulls himself into a sitting position, shaking his head.

This bemused, beaten, half-grin as he flicks blood from his

hand like his fingers had just brushed something sticky.

Say nothing. Keep Junior's .45 out. My intention crystal

clear: endgame. Koenig looks up, this odd squint, like a bum

about to beg for change.

Bradley, prim, proper, even this early. He sits down across

from me like some fucking Duke.

Just nod.

Bradley scoffs, pithy smile.

-round the corner: Glenda shaking but refusing to cry. I go

pale: what is this? Somebody to the left, look: Milteer. Look

back at Pete: tears in his bleary eyes as he crushes me with

a right cross.

Instant-drop, moan. Glenda screaming.

Pete looks to Milteer, wipes blurred eyes.

Pete bludgeons me. I try to get closer to Glenda. Feel my

nose shatter. Another swing: right cheek detonates. A left

hook to take advantage of my momentum: left eye explodes.

Glenda's crying/screaming gets me madder than anything.

Pete knocks me down again. My face in pieces.

Pete hesitates, puts his boot into my guts: 1, 2, 3-

Milteer produces a Polaroid, takes a snapshot of my shattered

husk, hands the camera to Pete on his way out:

Look back down at HER picture.

Put her photo in my chest pocket. Push the week-old Times

into a waste-basket: a Pan-Am ticket to LA underneath.

I stand, shatter the mirror that reminds me of how long. And

as I step out, an old man twenty-five years too late, and my

MGM-handsome, 1958 face smiles back at me through the shards.
