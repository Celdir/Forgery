Pretty. Pretty.

They giggle and Erica resumes packing Nina's shoulder bag

with extra clothing, shoes, snack filled tupperware, duct

tape, ribbon, thread, etc.

Nina smiles, comforted, and begins taking her vitamins.

Erica walks over with a SWEATSHIRT and holds it above her.

Nina pulls it over her head and starts to push her arms

through the sleeves.

5 INT. SUBWAY TRAIN - DAY 5

7 EXT. LINCOLN CENTER - DAY 7

8 INT. SOLOIST DRESSING ROOM - DAY 8

They snicker.

Irked, Nina starts POUNDING the shoes against the floor to

soften the toe.

Her eyes are drawn to a NEW GIRL standing in the doorway.

Nina pauses to scrutinize her. She wears vampy make-up, hair

down. Dark and sexy.

Wary, the girls mumble mmm-hmm's and nod.

9 INT. LARGE REHEARSAL SPACE - DAY 9

He heads to the line of soloists, studying them.

He taps a dancer on the shoulder, she lights up. He walks,

then taps another. A selection process of some kind.

Nina looks nervous, has an inkling of what it means.

He nears Nina. She sneaks peeks at him, eager and hopeful.

He acknowledges her with a small nod and a smile.

But he walks on without tapping her. She deflates.

He approaches the New Girl. Nina watches, threatened.

But he doesn't tap her either.

He taps one more soloist and then CLAPS.

The music stops and all the girls face him, attentive.

They respond "Good morning" in nervous, unsure voices.

He pauses for effect.

10 INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY - DAY 10

11 INT. PRINCIPAL DRESSING ROOM - SAME 11

12 INT. PRINCIPAL REHEARSAL SPACE - DAY 12

She can't help but smile, flattered. He pulls away from her.

He turns to the PIANO PLAYER.

The piano player rifles through the song book.

Nervous, she glances over at Veronica and Galina, who

anxiously await their turn.

She takes a few breaths, then looks towards the piano player

and nods.

The music begins.

Nina dances a few steps, and then launches into the most

difficult and famous part of Swan Lake: The Black Swan's

Coda. It consists of 32 consecutive fouettes (spins).

The music builds in intensity, she pushes herself into the

next turn.

Leroy runs his hand through his hair, dismayed.

A look of worry spreads across Nina's face. Knows she's

blowing it.

The door CLANGS open and throws Nina's focus completely. She

stumbles, several spins short of finishing.

At the end of the 32nd spin, Nina jabs her foot down hard.

She's done it!

Nina looks at herself in the mirror, glazed in sweat, a

slight smile of satisfaction.

18 INT. NINA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 18

Erica removes Nina's EARRINGS, then opens a JEWELRY BOX

sitting on the night stand and drops them inside. A TOY

BALLERINA spins to TINNY MUSIC.

Nina gets under the covers. Erica tucks her in and sits down

on the edge of the bed.

23 INT. LEROY'S OFFICE - SAME 23

He lifts his hands in the air, "there you go."

She makes a move towards the door.

She looks back at him, uncertain.

Leroy nonchalantly stubs out his cigarette.

He pauses, looks her up and down as if trying to decipher

her.

She doesn't know what he means. He comes around his desk and

approaches her.

Insecure, she looks like she wants to run out of the room.

He laughs.

He considers her for a moment.

Without warning, he slowly plants a kiss on her mouth.

It lasts for a moment, but he suddenly jerks away.

He touches his lip, stunned.

He leads her up a staircase to a landing that overlooks the

party.

She smiles, as instructed.

The crowd turns their gaze towards them. All eyes on her.

Polite applause.

More applause. Nervous, Nina unconsciously picks at her

cuticles.

People start whispering, stunned by the news. Nina sees Beth

in the crowd, giving a sad smile to the surrounding guests.

Trying to remain dignified.

36 INT. LIVING ROOM, PATRON OF THE ARTS APARTMENT - LATER 36

37 INT. BATHROOM - LATER 37

Lily pushes in.

Lily closes the door behind her and locks it.

Lily slides her PANTIES out from under her dress and puts

them in her clutch.

Lily starts to refresh her makeup.

Nina stays put for a second, uncertain.

38 EXT. UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 38

They turn, see Mrs. Brinson, the host of the party, standing

at the door.

He runs back inside to say his goodbyes.

Nina smiles after him, giddy and anxious.

She notices a slender figure watching her from the shadows of

the adjoining doorway. In the dark, she looks like Nina.

Spotted, the figure backs up, seeming to disappear.

Nina cautiously approaches, but can't see anyone.

She gets closer to the doorway...and someone JUMPS OUT,

startling her.

It's Beth, drunk and shivering. Cheeks streaked with mascara.

Beth stares her down. Nina backs up, nervously grabbing her

earlobe.

Nina shakes her head, confused.

Her words needle Nina, too close to the truth.

Nina's struck a nerve. Beth starts to come at her.

They both turn to see Leroy returned.

He puts his arm around Nina, starts to lead her away.

39 INT. LEROY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 39

She's caught off guard by his question and just smiles

uncomfortably. He waits for an answer. Finally she manages a

reply.

Her expression sours at this line of questioning. She shakes

her head.

Blushing and feeling awkward, she takes a sip of champagne.

Nina looks at him, embarrassed, and shrugs.

He smirks, and joins her on the couch.

49B Suddenly, the lights turn off, throwing them into total 49B

49C Leroy approaches Nina and takes her hands in his. 49C

He grabs her arm again, she spins, then he stops her, her

back to him.

He runs his hands down her arms. Slowly, seductively. She

trembles.

She turns and leans in close, as though to kiss him... almost

touching lips...but then she tries to push off again. He

tightens his grip, holds her there.

She looks back at him, questioning. He looks at her

intently, pulls her to him, and kisses her.

She melts and eagerly kisses him back. He pulls away,

momentarily.

She doesn't.

Nina follows his instruction.

The kiss grows more heated and he wraps his arms around her.

He pushes her back against the mirror. She whimpers.

He runs his hand down her body, then reaches between her

legs. She GASPS, tries to pull his hand out, but he persists.

She throws her head back as he kisses her neck. She breathes

deep, emits short MOANS, succumbing...

Suddenly, he pulls away from her. She looks at him confused,

flushed and breathing hard.

He turns and starts to walk away. She can't believe it.

He ignores her and walks out of the room.

50A INT. PRINCIPAL REHEARSAL SPACE - LATER 50A

50B Lily sits down beside her, oblivious of Nina's desire 50B

Nina reluctantly takes the cigarette, holds it a little

awkwardly, clearly not a regular smoker.

Lily sparks a flame for her and then lights one for herself.

Nina puffs, but doesn't inhale. Lily smirks.

Nina wipes off her tears with her hand.

Nina looks at her surprised.

Lily smirks with a realization.

Nina gives her a withering glance.

Nina stands up.

55 INT. LARGE REHEARSAL SPACE - DAY 55

They resume dancing. She finishes, out of breath, and looks

at Leroy and the Russian ballet mistress.

The piano music starts up again, and she begins dancing.

When she finishes, she looks at him, eager for feedback.

The music starts up again. Nina stays still, frustrated.

She doesn't understand. He gets up from his chair and goes to

her.

Nina looks away. Can't believe Lily talked to him.

Nina bites her tongue.

Erica glares at her.

Nina stares back defiantly.

Erica starts to come towards her.

The DOORBELL RINGS.

Erica looks at Nina questioningly. Nina shakes her head.

60 INT. BUILDING HALLWAY- NIGHT 60

Erica closes the door.

Nina looks at her, darkly.

Nina's tempted. Erica pokes her head out again.

Nina pushes the elevator call button.

Nina walks to the door, and grabs her coat.

61 INT. CORNER BISTRO - NIGHT 61

Nina blushes, embarrassed, and Lily cracks up. A WAITER drops

a plate in front of her.

He smiles, keeping his eyes locked on Lily, as he rudely

plops down Nina's plate.

Lily watches him go, then notices Nina looking annoyed.

Lily studies her and digs into her purse. Pulls out a SEXY

SHIRT.

Nina gives her a puzzled look.

Lily picks up her ungainly burger and takes a big bite, a

little grease dripping down her chin. Nina cuts into her dry

chicken breast.

Nina doesn't understand the question.

Lily pulls out a cigarette case and clicks it open. Inside,

CIGARETTES and a couple PILLS.

Lily grabs one of the pills and slides it over.

Lily grabs her pill and downs it with a beer.

Nina stares at her pill, too embarrassed to admit she doesn't

know what it is.

Nina blinks.

62 INT. GRUNGY BATHROOM - NIGHT 62

63 INT. CORNER BISTRO - NIGHT 63

She holds out her finger to one of the men, he sucks off the

liquid.

Lily looks over and catches Nina watching. She waves for her

to join them.

Nina reluctantly walks to her.

The guys laugh.

Lily holds out the doctored beverage. Nina eyes it, tempted

to go down the rabbit hole...

Nina grins sheepishly and takes the drink. Lily smiles.

Nina takes a tiny sip.

64 INT. CORNER BISTRO - MOMENTS LATER 64

Lily sips her drink, staring at Tom flirtatiously.

Tom laughs, amused by Nina's earnestness.

She looks at Nina and sucks down her drink, challenging her

to follow suit. Nina takes a breath of courage and empties

her glass.

She waits for something to kick in.

Lily slips out of the booth and Tom follows, leaving Nina and

Andrew alone. She avoids his gaze, nervous.

Her cell phone RINGS, interrupting him. She quickly turns it

off and gives him an embarrassed smile.

She starts to feel the initial tingles of the drug.

continues dancing.

Nina is forced to watch from the sidelines as Lily and David

finish the Black Swan's Pas de Deux.

He turns to Nina and his smile fades.

He ignores her, and walks off stage.

Lily tentatively approaches with the PRACTICE TUTU.

Nina snatches it, avoiding eye contact. She puts it on.

Nina starts stretching.

Nina doesn't answer.

Nina stops herself.

Lily can read something on her face.

Nina glances at the dancers, nervous they've heard.

Other dancers look over.

Nina resumes stretching. Lily just walks away.

Nina spins Beth around. She is now a bloody version of THE

DOUBLE! She continues stabbing herself.

Nina grabs the Double's hand and struggles to restrain her.

The emory board stabs into Nina's arm.

Nina rushes from the room.

Nina gives in, too tired to fight her. Her eyes drift to the

source of the tinny music: the open jewelry box. The

ballerina's been broken off, all that remains is a single

amputated leg, spinning morbidly on the base.

Nina's eyes drift to the alarm clock. It's gone.

Nina looks at the dark window.

Nina reads Erica's face. Reality clicks in.

Nina tries to sit up, but her mother pushes her back down.

Nina freaks, struggles more violently.

Nina squirms free of Erica's grasp and gets out of bed. She

gets to the door...

But the doorknob's been knocked-off, leaving just a metal

post sticking out of the hole.

Nina grips the metal post and pulls and pulls, shaking the

door.

Erica calmly sits down in her CHAIR, waiting for the storm to

pass.

Nina rifles through her dresser drawers.

She notices her mother sitting calmly.

Nina grabs her by the wrist.

Nina yanks Erica off the chair onto the floor.

Under the cushion Nina grabs the hidden brass DOORKNOB.

Erica lunges for her daughter's legs.

Nina jams the knob onto the post, opens the door.

sets it on her chair.

He hasn't.

Leroy smirks at her directness.

He looks at her, considering, and gives her a reluctant nod.

She smiles.

Nina looks into the mirror. Instead of Lily's reflection

there's the Double.

Nina's fury rises up from inside.

She charges...

And smashes her into the WALL LENGTH MIRROR, shattering it.

Shards fall everywhere.

The Double flips Nina over and wails on her. Punch after

punch.

Nina does her best to block the onslaught.

They scuffle, knocking things over, bumping into walls.

The Double gets her hands around Nina's neck...

Gasping for air, Nina tries to pull the hands free, but she's

too strong.

Nina barely manages a nod.

Lily turns and walks away.

Nina swiftly shuts the door.

She turns around, stares at the wardrobe.

She steps cautiously towards it, her face repeated

countlessly in all the reflective shards.

She lifts the towel from the ground and looks at it.

It is clean. No blood. She looks down at the floor. No blood

there either.

She slowly opens the door to the wardrobe...

And finds it empty. No body whatsoever.

She looks over at the broken mirror. Sees her reflection

staring back at her.

She stares at it for a long beat, and realizes something.

She touches her stomach and winces a little. Pulls back her

hand. It's coated with red liquid. Blood.

It's started to soak through the costume, creating a faint

red spot. The fabric is ripped at the center of the stain.

She feels inside for confirmation.

And discovers a stab wound, in her own stomach.

She pulls out the sharp tip of mirror still stuck inside.

Blood begins flowing more rapidly.

She drops the mirror.

In a daze, she sits down at the vanity, and finishes applying

the rest of the White Swan's makeup.

Nina is too weak to move.

Lily pushes her way into the group and GASPS, pointing at

Nina's abdomen.

Leroy follows her gaze and discovers the spot of blood, which

has grown in size.

Leroy looks back at her. She smiles.

He understands.

The APPLAUSE grows more and more faint. Her eyes glaze over

and everything goes completely SILENT.

Nina lies there motionless, a smile frozen on her face.

CUT TO BLACK.
