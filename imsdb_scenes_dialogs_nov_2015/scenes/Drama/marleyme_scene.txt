Whoops... wrong file...

LAUGHTER O.S. and we begin PULLING BACK TO REVEAL:

A RECEPTION HALL (BEGIN CREDITS) - DAY

The lights are dim. We're looking at a blank, pull-down

movie screen in a darkened ballroom.

SEBASTIAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)

Hang on, I got this--

Someone O.S. starts CLINKING a fork against a wine glass. Is

joined by others, and then we HEAR calls of "Kiss! Kiss!"

ON A BRIDE AND GROOM

sitting at the main table, In silhouette, seen from behind,

lit only by the votives sprinkled along the table: JOHN

GROGAN and his bride of two hours, JENNY. In response to the

crowd, they kiss.

Standing right by them is SEBASTIAN -- tall, good looking,

rugged type --John's best man.

Alright, now I'm ready--

And now, on THE PORTABLE SCREEN, Sebastian'S MONTAGE BEGINS:

John with his Mom in front of the college dorm, etc.

SEBASTIAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)

Here's John, first week of college.

Nice hair, right?

You think that feathering 'S easy?

true. Takes a very well p

wrist action...

CHUCKLES from the crowd.

SEBASTIAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)

I'm just saying...

SEVERAL PHOTOS OF JOHN

Throughout college...

SEBASTIAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)

Was John a star athlete?

A shot of him fumbling a frisbee,

SEBASTIAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)

Umm, no. Was he a ladies man?

With mid-eighties hair, bad glasses.

SEBASTIAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)

You tell me.

What he was, was John, and we loved

for it.

John walking down the quad, with "DUMBASS" written on his

forehead. People passing him are smirking.

(to CAMERA, which is

People are staring at me - is my fly

No, no, it's cool.

All right, enough with the -

(as he gets another giggle)

- all right, what? What are you

looking at?

Oh, wait, there's something on your

forehead.

John brushes it.

You got it. Leaf or something.

A leaf. On my forehead.

Yeah, it musta had some sap on it.

They pass a cluster of CO EDS who laugh at John.

SEBASTIAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)

And then there's Jenny.

4 PHOTOS OF JENNY

Studious, hard-working, quiet.

PHOTOS OF A WILDER JENNY

In short-shorts, wet T-shirt, throwing water balloons at a

frat house. Standing on an empty keg of beer, rolling it

like it's a log.

SEBASTIAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)

Well, okay, sometimes not so quiet.

VIDEO OF JENNY

Ordering a bunch of guys around, telling who to go where, as

the camera ZOOMS OUT, we see they're playing touch football -

except she tackles. Hard. And then does a little victory

dance over the fallen. Jenny's the captain, in charge...

Okay, maybe a little high-spirited,

maybe voted Miss Kegger once or twice

too often on Fraternity ROW, but a good

girl underneath it all. Now could they

not fall in love?

TWO PHOTOS JUXTAPOSED

One of John "flexing" beside a lake, another of Jenny

screaming at a football game with a beer in her hand.

SEBASTIAN (O.S.) (CONT'D)

Now, in any decent love story, you

gotta have the great first meeting.

5 INT. CAR - MOVING - DAY (VIDEO FOOTAGE)

Sebastian is obviously the passenger shooting John, who's

driving.

All right, I'm zooming in. Whoa. Not

a flosser.

Turn it off.

And as he REACHES for it - WHAM'. He hits another car! The

camera goes flying. Fumbles. SCREAMS. YELLS.

Jesus Christ!

They're okay! They're getting out.

Sebastian manages to right the CAMERA and unsteadily films

John getting out of the car, heading towards the car he hit.

The passenger door opens and Jenny comes out. She's covered

in frosting and the remains of a birthday cake which she was

carrying in her lap. The damaged car is full of balloons.

Are you a complete idiot?!

SEBASTIAN (O.S.)

And so one of the truly great love

affairs of the late eighties began.

In the home video, Jenny advances on John, hurls the rest of

the cake at him, starts flailing at him with her hands.

Jenny who was the editor of said

paper...

8 INT. RECEPTION ROOM - DAY 8

The wedding GUESTS APPLAUD, the lights come up, and Sebastian

concludes his toast.

And now, please join me in raising a

but - anyway: to John and Jenny

Grogan.

CONTINUE PULLING BACK TO REVEAL...

INT. HOTEL BATHROOM - NIGHT

The two of them sit on the edge of the bathtub, soaking their

sore feet. Jenny's still in her wedding dress, bunched up so

as not to get it wet. John has got the pant legs of his tux

rolled up.

Jenny takes a swig from a bottle of champagne, passes it to

John. He looks at her.

How do I get vou?

What?

I'm serious. In what world does a guy

like me get someone like you?

Are you kidding?

(leans on him)

You're part of the plan.

The plan.

Step one. Meet an incredibly sweet,

smart, sexy guy.

Done. Step two?

Marry him.

Check. Step three?

She smiles, puts her face right up to his...

Now that one's a surprise...

You okay?

Oh yeah.

12 EXT. FORT LAUDERDALE SUN-SENTINEL NEWSPAPER BUILDING - DAY 12

As jenny pulls up out front of the building.

INT. CAR - SAME

She turns to John.

You know you got this.

I know, I got it.

Who are you?

I'm John Grogan.

Wrong. You're John Friggin Grogan

who's about to get a job.

She leans over and gives him a big, long kiss.

Um, okay, see now I don't wanna get out

of the car.

i really just wanna sit here and make

out with you.

--Get out of the car.

He nods, starts to get out, then pauses.

Who am i again?

Kidding.

13 EXT. FORT LAUDERDALE SUN-SENTINEL NEWSPAPER BUILDING - DAY 13

As John crosses his fingers, waves and enters the building...

14 INT. EDITOR'S OFFICE - DAY (1990) 14

editor of the Sun-Sentinel of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, is

flipping through John's portfolio.

Yes, sir, I got a Mitchy.

(off Arnie's look)

Like a Pulitzer, but for western

Michigan.

A Mitchy. Min-hmm. So, tell me, why

did you want to leave the estimable -

(he flips to a story, reads

- Kalamazoo Gazette?

Well, as you know, Sebastian and I were

in college together, and he was always

talking about South Florida... mostly

about the women of South Florida, but

anyway, after my wife and I got married

we thought it might be nice to come

For the women?

Uh, no-- for the... the... uh...

For the work?

Yes. That.

Your wife's Jenny Havens, right?

Well, Jenny Grogan now--

She take the job at the Post?

I tried to get her over her

Damn fine writer.

What's the matter, the Post didn't want

Yo m?

Well, she does features. I'm more a

straight news writer. This is a better

paper for that.

Straight news writer, huh. Meaning you

think you're a reporter?

Meaning I know I am.

And the six other sweaty-palmed college

grads I'm interviewing today, you think

you're better than them?

No, sir. In fact, I'm pretty sure I'm

not. But I do know that I always seem

to surprise myself. Ten years ago, I

was doing bong hits and playing Donkey

Kong, never dreamed I'd get into

college. But I did, and I graduated

with honors. Two years ago, my buddies

told me that the most Jenny Havens

would ever say to me was, You're sweet,

but I don't like you in that way.. But

she did like me in that way-- and my

buddies can suck it because I married

her. I certainly never thought I'd win

some award with a dumbass name--

The "Mitchy."

Exactly sir. But i surprised myself

and I won it. And if you give me the

chance, I'm pretty sure I'll surprise

you, too.

Arnie considers him a moment.

That's quite a speech, son. You

rehearse that, or come up with it on

the fly?

Elevator, on the way up.

How'd I do?

Arnie just looks back at him.

15 INT. PARKED CAR - DAY 15

So?

He's got me on a little thing they like

to call... Desert Storm--

YOU GOT THE JOB!

She gets out of the car and the two embrace right there on

the street. She takes out her notebook, crosses something

off on her "list."

okay... "Jobs." Done.

So what's next? Lunch?

House.

16 EXT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD - DAY 16

A HORN HONKING as a ca g nos by on the Dixie Highway in the

b.g. We tilt down to a very mixed neighborhood, to a modest

house, THE SOUND OF A TV BROADCAST OVER...

17 INT. 345 CHURCHILL - KITCHEN - DAY 17

News footage of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on television. John

and Jenny sit at the table reading a different newspapers. He

glances at her...

You like the quote about the speed

bumps?

"If they save even one life--"

-"it would be worth it. And with that,

Janet Dickerson's mother's eyes filled

with tears."

That one just felt exactly right,

y'know?

Yeah, no, it's good. What happened to

the Desert Storm piece?

That's it. The injured girl's dad's in

Kuwait. What, that's not in there?

(looks at the article)

Uhhhh... they must've cut it... And

they kinda misspelled your name. John

Egan...

What-- you're kidding--

He reaches for the paper, but she holds it away.

Forget it. It's good, John. It's got

facts, some color. It's a solid piece.

Thanks. I'm almost done with yours.

This idea of voting machines sounds

Well, except on the other page I talk

about what could happen--

He goes back to reading. She sips her coffee.

Oh, it continues...

An awkward moment as he now searches for the new page, has to

fold back the paper. No escaping the fact that ie article is

longer and more important than his. She finally gets up...

You know what? The rest is just okay,

really pretty boring...

No, no, I'm enjoying it...

He tortures himself and keeps reading. She moves to the sink,

starts to rinse out her cup...

Wow, they really gave you a lot of

space, didn't they?

She sets the cup on the counter, looks at the WILTED PLANT on

the sill.

Damn. I killed another one. How am I

ever going to take care of a kid, I

can't even keep a plant alive?

John looks up from the paper. "Kid?" She comes gives him a

kiss.

She headsout, leaving John staring terrified at the plant.

18 EXT. SUN-SENTINEL OFFICE - DAY

through the office throughout...

Well, what'd you expect? You bought a

house, man. A house with a mare

room...

What's wrong with a spare room?

It's empty, John. That's what's wrong

with it. And you know what else is

empty? Her womb.

I'm starting to worry that we're

already at Step Six.

What?

You know Jenny, she's got her whole

life organized and planned out...

Sebastian smiles at a secretary, turns back to John.

You want my advice? Get her a PuPPYa

A puppy.

Something other than you she has to

take care of.

(points at him)

You have a kid, you're a dad. You're

not you anymore. You have a dog,

you're a master. You're still a guy.

With a life.

And a dog...

Whatever, man. You're still free.

You've stopped the clock.

What clock?

Okay... you know in movies when

there's, like, a bomb and it's ticking

down, ten seconds left, and there's

some guy with a wire cutter going, "red

wire... blue wire... which one do I

cut?" And the guy finally just makes a

wild-assed guess and SNIP. Silence.

The world is saved.

Okay... is the bomb strapped to a

dog... because I'm not sure I'm

John, you buy this dog, you're saving

your world. Because that ticking you

hear, is not a bomb, it's her

biological clock.

John looks back at him.

Huh.

ARNIE .(O.S.)

Sebastian!

They both turn as Arnie sticks his head out of his office.

Your travel's approved. Get outta here.

In motion.

Where you going?

Colombia. I got a guy down there, says

he can put me next to Pablo Escobar--

I'm doing this piece, I follow a single

coca leaf from Colombia, to the streets

of Miami.

Yeah, you and I once talked about doing

something like that. We were gonna call

it, "From Plant to Pusher." Remember?

Not really.

--there was another fire at the county

dump. Some kinda methane leak.

Actually, it's Grogan--

I want two paragraphs for the blotter.

John nods, looks off at Sebastian who now sits down at his

cluttered desk, pulls a DUFFLE BAG from under his desk. John

watches with envy as Sebastian starts stuffing cameras,

recorders, a bowie knife, into the duffle...

So uh, what kind of puppy?

Sebastian looks up at him.

To, y'know, cut the wire.

Get her a lab. They're supposed to be

just like little kids. But easier to

train.

19 EXT. DOG BREEDER'S HOUSE - MORNING

As John and Jenny get out of the car. She looks at the house.

This isn't the ihop...

A little surprise first...

20 INT. DOG BREEDER'S HOUSE - DAY

John is leading Jenny, her eyes closed, through a house

towards the kitchen. LORI, 55, leathery and smoking, is

going in front.

Sorry about the smell.

When can I look?

Just hang on...

Lori opens a door to a laundry room.

Okay. Now.

Jenny opens her eyes and sees a utility room. Nine yellow

yipping Lab puppies tumble out of a cardboard box towards

John and Jenny.

Happy Birthday.

Oh my God... they're adorable...

Wait a minute, my birthday's a month

from now.

That's okay, they can't leave for

another three weeks anyway.

John, we never even talked about this.

You're right. Let's go.

He's kidding. And besides, Jenny's already on the floor,

letting the puppies climb all over her.

Look at you guys...

I got papers on the mom and the dad, so

you can register these.

Is the father here too?

Oh, yeah, somewhere. Anyway, girls are

$400, boys are $375. Except this

little guy here.

She points to one male puppy, who is clearly the goofiest

most excited.

You can have him for $325.

How sweet. He's on clearance...

Well, he's a little too stocky for the

breed, so he probably won't show.

He's so sweet...

Marley & He Shooting Draft  18.

He likes you.

John, I don't know if I'm ready for a

You have to wait three weeks for the

litter to get weaned, before you can

bring 'em home anyway.

Plenty of time to get ready.

I won't even be here. I'm gonna be with

my sister then...

No problem. I can take him. Be good

bonding time. Get him all trained in

time for you to come home.

A chuckle from Lori.

Let's give 'em all the scare test.

The what?

I hear the best dog in the litter is

the one who doesn't spook easily. They

turn out to be the most people-

centered.

Uh, how are you gonna--

John turns away, and then suddenly turns back with a loud

step and a "BOO"! All of the puppies scatter. Lily barks.

But Clearance Puppy just leaps onto his shoes, his tail

wagging.

Well, that's your guy.

John scoops him up. Clearance Puppy licks his face. John

hands him to Jenny. She lets him lick her face...

I would've picked you anyway--

Meant to be.

He watches her cuddle the puppy and knows he's done the right

thing.

21 EXT. LORI'S HOUSE -- DAY 21

Lori waves goodbye, check in her hand, as John and Jenny walk

to the car. Jenny carries a Polaroid of Clearance Puppy.

You really sure about this? I mean, a

puppy's a lot of work.

How hard could it be?

We hear A COMMOTION is coming from the woods, something

crashing through the brush, breathing heavily. They both

freeze as the sound comes their way.

What's that?

Just then they are nearly knocked off their feet by a huge,

rampaging Labrador, soaking wet, covered with mud and burrs.

It circles them, barking WILDLY, a crazed look in its eye. It

jumps up on John, muddies his shirt, then barrels past Lori

into the house, knocking over a chair on the porch as it

goes. A beat.

I think we just met the dad.

22 EXT. AIRPORT - DAY 22

John kissing Jenny good-bye. They finally part...

Call me as soon as you get him home.

Oh, hey, we need a name.

How 'bout I just call him "Clearance

Puppy" until you get back. I only hope

he doesn't say his first word without

you.

23 EXT. LORI'S HOUSE - NIGHT

John steps out of his car and the puppy, now twice the size

he was three weeks ago, bounds over to him. A harried Lori

follows, a rope leash and instruction. sheet in hand.

Whoa! He got big... This is the right

one, right?

You should see him pack away the puppy

chow.

So, what if I run into any problems?

Oh. Sure, call me. All sales are

final, though. Not just for him. I

tell that to everyone.

You want help getting him in the car?

No, that's okay, I'll just...

John opens the door, indicates that Marley should jump in.

Instead, the puppy runs around the car, barking, jumping up

on the bumpers. John finally catches him, lifts him up, puts

him on the front passenger seat atop some towels.

There we go.

Well, anyway, thanks for--

But Lori's already inside her house, the door closed.

24 INT. JOHN'S CAR - NIGHT 24

John and the puppy on the drive home. The puppy atop a pile

of towels. John looks at him.

Hey... guy.

The dog just stares at him quizzically. Uncomfortable alone

with the dog, John turns on the radio. BOB MARLEY plays and

the puppy THUMPS HIS TAIL.

You like Bob Marley?

The dog THUMPS HIS TAIL AGAIN. John turns up the music.

THUMP. THUMP. THUMP faster this time.

(trying it out)

Bob?

(nothing, then)

Marley.

THUMP THUMP THUMP.

Marley. Okay-- Marley. Cool.

But now the pup starts wriggling towards John, John tries to

put him back...

No-- stay boy... stay.

(the dog crawls into his lap)

Okay, not really safe, bud--

Marley gets stuck with half his body draped over the console.

He remains like this, his tail thumping... John gives up.

25 EXT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD - NIGHT

John pulls up in the driveway and opens the

jumps out.

This is our house...

The dog immediately pees on the ground.

26 INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

As John crouches down, shows him his bowls...

This one's water. This one's food.

Marley starts pawing the food bag.

C'mon, man, you've already had kibble

and half a seat belt.

(moment, relents)

All right. Special treat. But just

today...

He opens the bag and Marley tackles it. Several cupfuls

spill onto the floor. John goes to the pantry to get the

dustpan and brush. When he returns, he finds Marley has

eaten the food in the bowl AND every last scrap of spilled

food. And now he's squatting to pee again...

No, no, no!

He picks up the puppy and rushes him outside.

27 EXT. 345 CHURCHILL - BACKYARD - NIGHT 27

As John sets him down on the ground, steps back.

Okay, now. Pee.

He motions with his zipper.

C'mon, man, do your thing.

(Marley just stares)

Alright, I'm gonna show you this one

time...

From behind, we see John peeing.

Except you gotta lift your leg.

(lifts his leg)

See, this is how you guys do it...

Marley looks at him, squats and pees...

Or you could do it like that. Just not

in front of other guy dogs.

28 INT. JENNY'S SISTER'S HOUSE - NIGHT 28

Jenny's on the phone. Her young NIECE and NEPHEW wait for

her, a board game on the floor between them. She motions

that she'll just be a second...

29 INT. 345 CHURCHILL - NIGHT 29

John's on the phone, talking to Jenny as he follows Marley

around the room, trying to keep shoes and socks and cords out

of his mouth...

Are you sure? Because it can be

temporary...

INTERCUTTING: JOHN & JENNY

No, it's good.

He must be exhausted.

Oh, yeah, he's pooped.

Marley lets out a SQUEAK as he tugs at a couch cushion...

Oh, he sounds so sweet!

Yeah...

(snapping his fingers at the

dog, shaking his head "no")

He's very cute. Just like a little kid

only furrier.

Put the phone by his ear...

John chases after the dog who burrows under the couch, his

tail sticking out so that John can't get him...

Uh, okay, he's listening.

John just holds the phone awkwardly as Jenny coos baby talk.

(into the phone)

Hey, Marley! Who's my good boy?!

Mommy can't wait to meet you...

Anyway, don't worry, he's doing great.

Like he's lived here his whole life.

All eight weeks of it. And you know

what else? I think he's going to be

pretty easy to train. I mean, he's

curious which means he's smart, right?

Of course he is. I can't wait to see

him.

Just him?

Jealous?

I'm not the one sleeping in a box.

I love you. I'll see you Friday.

30 INT. GARAGE - NIGHT 30

John, dressed to go out, is setting down Marley in his wooden

box on the garage floor.

I'll see you in the morning, okay?

Marley looks at him with a heartbreaking expression. John

hesitates.

Aw, come on, don't. You'll be fine,

alright. And tomorrow, we're gonna

tear it up. I'm thinking kibble, park,

chew toy, the whole nine yards. Okay?

we good?

Marley doesn't-look so good, looks kind of sad. John turns

and gets out of there.

31 EXT. DRIVEWAY - NIGHT 31

John gets into his car. He can hear WHIMPERING.

Big day tomorrow! Rest up, pal!

He listens a beat; Marley quiets down. He gets in his car.

32 INT. BAR - NIGHT 32

Journalist hang out.'John and Sebastian at the bar. Many know

Sebastian, he's constantly nodding at people throughout:

So I'm there in this cave, right?

Blindfolded. And I can feel the

machine guns, there's like nine of 'em

around me... and they tie me to a chair

and then Escobar comes in and says--

are you ready?

I read your piece on Kadahfi, And I

think you captured his narcissism just

right.

Can you believe that?

Some of it.

Man, I wish you could've been there.

Yeah, but then I wouldn't have been

able to do the piece on the water main

break at the library. That would have

sucked.

(hand on John's shoulder)

Your time will come, amigo.

I'll drink to that--

They toast with their beers, Sebastian clocks John looking at

his watch.

You gotta be somewhere?

Oh. No, it's the puppy. It's his first

You got adoc?

Marley. A little lab. Like you said.

Remember? The bomb...

Oh, right. Smart move. You'll see.

(slaps him on the back)

You've just preserved your quiet way of

life for at least another two years.

33 EXT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD -- NIGHT

John pulls up, gets out of his car. Halfway down the block,

we see a POLICE CAR, lights flashing, two OFFICERS talking to

a COUPLE. Another NEIGHBOR, in his robe, stands in the

street watching...

Millers got robbed again.

(then, turns to John)

And that mutt of yours hasn't shut up

since you left.

John looks towards the garage where we hear WHIMPERING.

34 INT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD - GARAGE - NIGHT 34

The door opens and the puppy gets excited--

No no... I just wanted you to know I'm

back.

The puppy whimpers and he goes over to him, reaches into the

box and pets him...

Buddy, you really gotta chill, okay?

Yeah, I know, good to see you, too.

But I'm just inside the house, I'll see

you in the morning. Big day tomorrow.

Get some sleep.

35 INT. 345 CHURCHILL - KITCHEN - NIGHT 35

John gulps orange juice from the bottle. Leaves a quarter-

inch, puts it back in the fridge. And now we hear BARKING

from the Garage.

36 INT. 345 CHURCHILL - BATHROOM - NIGHT 36

Water running. John swallows some preventative aspirin,

picks some nachos off his shirt. He turns off the water.

And we hear WAILING and KEENING coming from the garage.

37 INT. 345 CHURCHILL - BEDROOM - NIGHT 37

John has his head buried under the pillows AS THE WAILING AND

KEENING GO ON. AND ON. AND ON. Finally, John can't take it

anymore. He sits up, pulls earplugs out of his ears.

38 INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

As the light comes on and Marley's head appears over the top

of the box. John sighs, comes over and scoops him up...

39 INT. 345 CHURCHILL - BEDROOM - NIGHT 39

John gets Marley settled in the box, now by the side of the

bed.

Just this one time.

John climbs into bed, shuts off the light. Marley whimpers

and John rolls onto his stomach, reaches into the box and

strokes his back, the puppy lays down, still whimpers...

Oh, come on...

Hey. Remember this?

(half drunk, sings badly)

One love, one heart...

Let's get together and feel alright...

John nods off, one arm hanging over the side of the bed into

the box, his hand resting on Marley's back as the puppy now

snoozes peacefully and we then...

FADE OUT.

AN ALARM CLOCK SOUNDS.

40 FADE IN: CLOSE-UP OF MARLEY'S FACE 40

Tail rising in the b.g., wagging.

REVEAL: BEDROOM - MORNING

As John opens his eyes to see Marley snuggled up against his

face. Marley's eyes looking into his. John reaches over the

puppy and shuts off the alarm.

She comes home today.

Hung over, he sits up, looks around the messy room, half due

to John's bachelor housekeeping habits, half due to Marley.

Not only has everything has been chewed, but some time during

the night Marley discovered how much fun toilet paper is.

We should probably clean up.

41 INT. 345 CHURCHILL - DAY 41

John vacuums, struggles to empty the bag, puts a broken vase

in the trash, does the dishes, etc. Marley follows him, tail

wreaking havoc, knocking over everything that isn't nailed

down. John picks up the HUGE CHEW TOY he'd just bought and

examines it as Marley runs into the bathroom...

Huh.

It's already completely gnawed up. John looks at Marley who

emerges dragging a roll of toilet paper, rams right into the

screen door, bounces back.

Marley, it's a screen, you're not gonna

Meanwhile, Marley backs up a few steps, gets a head of steam,

then rams into it again, this time goes right through it.

--there.

42 INT. BATHROOM - LATER 42

John gets drenched as he gives Marley a bath.

43 INT. GARAGE - DAY 43

John drags Marley into the garage.

I'll be back in an hour. Be good.

44 EXT. GROCERY STORE - DAY

A bit of THUNDER as John comes out with a bag of groceries

and a bunch of flowers. He gets to the car just as the rain

hits.

45 EXT. AIRPORT - DAY

As John and Jenny kiss outside the terminal. She holds a

stuffed "Pluto."

How's my puppy?

I'm okay. A little tired, but

She nudges him. He gives her another kiss.

He's waiting for you.

46 EXT. 345 CHURCHILL - DRIVEWAY - DAY 46

John and Jenny get out of the car. We hear WHIMPERING in the

garage.

Marley!

She takes off for the side door of the garage.

47 INT. 345 CHURCHILL - GARAGE - DAY 47

They open the door and freeze.

Oh my God.

It's a mess. It's almost incredible that it's all due to a

single puppy. The box is in shreds; so are the blankets. A

puddle of urine on the floor. A large piece of dry wall has

been chewed off near the big garage door. The garbage cans

are overturned. Marley is whimpering in the corner.

Wow. Okay, this is not how I left it.

How long has he been in here?

An hour, at the most.

(looks around, then)

Jeez... he Alg drywall. That's just not

right.

(she picks him up)

Look. He's shaking--

Another bit of THUNDER and the puppy whimpers louder.

Does thunder scare you, Mister? Hm?

He licks her face, snuggles into her. She gives him the

Pluto stuffed animal. She hugs him...

Look at us.

She looks up at John and smiles. He returns the smile.

Mission accomplished.

48 INT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD - DAY 48

As Marley bursts out of the back bedroom with one of Jenny's

bras in his mouth.

Marley, no!

Jenny chases him into the kitchen, past John who holds up the

newspaper...

He gave me an extra paragraph...

Marley bursts through the back screen door...

49 EXT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD - BACKYARD - DAY 49

A seemingly continuous shot, except that it's now A SIX MONTH

OLD MARLEY who comes through the screen into the backyard now

clutching a set of curtains in his mouth, still attached to

the rod, and it's now JOHN who stumbles through the broken

wire mesh to chase after him...

Marley, no!

John chases him across the backyard. Marley goes under the

fence and John starts to go over into...

50 EXT. THE NEIGHBOR'S BACKYARD - DAY

And now it's a NINE MONTH OLD MARLEY who comes up from under

the fence clutching a THANKSGIVING TURKEY in his mouth. And

now it's Jenny AND John who go over the fence chasing him...

Marley, no!

They wave to the NEIGHBOR standing on his patio watching.

Hi, Tom-- Sorry...

Happy Thanksgiving...

Marley goes through a hedge and out onto...

51 EXT. STREET - DAY 51

Where Marley emerges into FRAME a FULL GROWN DOG, rapidly

pulling Jenny by the leash along the intercoastal waterway.

We track with him until a WOMAN WALKING A POODLE IS NOW IN

FRAME and Marley gets the two women entangled as he starts

humping the smaller dog...

Marley, no!

52 INT. SUN-SENTINEL - ARNIE'S OFFICE - DAY

John sits across from Arnie. He looks thrown:

I don't understand, why me?

I'm in a bind, John.

But I'm a reporter, not a columnist.

It's a step up.

Yeah, but it's a step away from what I

wanna do.

It's also better pay, you set your own

hours, pick your own topics...

and it's only temporary, just until I

find someone permanent.

What happened to Jerry?

You may have noticed that in every

other column, he went on about The Pie

Palace?

I really haven't read his--

Turns out he's been getting free meals

in exchange for mentioning the joint.

It's also why he became such a fat ass.

John nods. Oh.

Anyway, it's twice a week. And like I

said, it's only until I can find

someone else to replace him. Then

you're back on, uh... whatever beat you

were on.

53 EXT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD - DAY 53

John pulls up, gets out of the car. His neighbors, The

year-old GIRL -- short blue hair, pierced eyebrow -- and her

MOM -- in a nurses uniform -- unload groceries from the car.

Your dog's funny.

Uh, thanks.

He tried to eat one of our tires.

Yeah, well, dogs need rubber. Little

known fact, helps the digestive

tract...

Right. Along with the occasional black

Converse high top which I'd still love

to get back by the way.

I'll do what I can.

'Preciate that.

54 INT. KITCHEN - DAY

John sits at the table scribbling on a legal pad. He tears

off the sheet and crumples it up, throws it across the room.

Marley bounds into the room, Jenny behind him, sweating.

I think he dislocated my shoulder. He

doesn't heel-- hell, he doesn't even

walk, he sprints, and I had to pull him

off three dogs...

Poodle?

Yeah, among others. There was a

Yorkie, a Dalmatian and a bichon frise

that may never be right again.

(sees the legal pad)

What're you doing?

Arnie gave me a column.

You're kidding? Congratulations!

Oh, yeah, it's a big honor. I get to

write about zoning laws and yard sales.

I bet you make something out of it.

It's only temporary until he finds

someone else. I'm just trying to get

something down for Tuesday.

She gives him a kiss, starts out of the room

You'll think of something. And John,

I'm serious abut Marley. He wreaks

havoc everywhere he goes. We gotta do

something...

55 EXT. PARK - DAY

MS. KORNBLUT, weathered and stern, is studying John. Behind

John, eight puppies and their owners are chatting before the

class begins.

MS. KORNBLUT

Incorrigible? I don't believe in that.

All dogs want to learn. But they can't

when their owners are weak-willed.

I'm very strong-willed.

MS. KORNBLUT

And where is your animal?

He's over there. With my wife. He was

a little excited. He usually needs a

little time to calm down.

Ms. Kornblut looks at Jenny as she struggles up with Marley.

MS. KORNBLUT

I see. He calls the shots. Which of

you will be the trainer?

we thought we both would, since we want

him to listen to both of us at home -

MS. KORNBLUT

A dog can only answer to one master.

Which one of you has the most natural

authority in your own relationship?

I'll watch.

MS. KORNBLUT

I thought so. We begin.

56 EXT. PARK - LATER 56

As Ms. Kornblut gestures, demonstrates the command:

MS. KORNBLUT

Sit!

The students order their dogs to sit, and most of them do.

The ones that don't require only a little effort to get the

idea. Whereas:

Jenny orders Marley to sit; instead Marley jumps up on her

and puts his paws on her shoulders. She presses his butt to

the ground, and he rolls over for a belly rub. She tries to

tug him into place and he grabs the leash in his teeth,

shaking it playfully.

MS. KORNBLUT (CONT'D)

That, class, is an example of a dog

that has been foolishly allowed to

believe he is the alpha male of his

pack. And therefore he cannot be a

happy animal.

(from the sidelines)

Yeah, he looks really bummed.

Kornblut hears him, death stares John.

MS. KORNBLUT

You. Joker. Rotate in.

John looks at Jenny who shrugs, holds up the leash for him to

take.

57 CUT TO: A HEAVY CHOKE CHAIN 57

As Ms. Kornblut demonstrates on her wrist.

MS. KORNBLUT

The choke chain. When your animal

walks properly by your side, there'll

be slack. If he pulls, it tightens

around his neck like a noose and

loosens as soon as he stops pulling.

Does it hurt them?

MS. KORNBLUT

Well, it's not called a hug chain. But

they learn to like it. Go on, collar

your dogs.

Everyone else quickly, easily gets the choke chain around

their dogs' necks. Of course. Meanwhile:

John kneels down and struggles to put it. around Marley's

neck. Marley, liking its shiny jingling, tries to eat it.

Much tussling, and John finally gets it around Marley's neck -

but Marley still manages to grab it in his teeth.

He likes it.

MS. KORNBLUT

That's because he's eating it... Get it

out of his mouth. Class? Give your

dogs the sit command.

All the dogs sit; John forces Marley's butt down.

MS. KORNBLUT (CONT'D)

The leash is held in two places. Loop

around your right hand, left hand at

waist level. Dog always on your left,

of course.

That means us, pal.

He rearranges Marley so he's on John's left.

MS. KORNBLUT

Now, when you give the heel command,

step off with your left foot - I don't

want to see any right foot first

steppers - and walk. If your dog gets

ahead, administer a correction by

forcefully bring your left hand down

and towards the right, and he'll

respond. Shall we? One, two, three -

now!

Just as the dogs and owners prepare to step off, Marley

lurches ahead of the pack...

Marley, heel!

Marley takes off like a fighter jet, dragging John behind.

MS. KORNBLUT

Correct him!

John gives a mighty yank on the leash. Marley coughs,

hesitates. John loosens the leash - and Marley explodes

forward again. John yanks, Marley stops, John releases,

Marley explodes forward.

MS. KORNBLUT (CONT'D)

Rein in that dog! All right, everyone,

line up again. Demonstration. Mr.

Grogan? Pay attention.

She takes the leash from John and efficiently guides him into

line with the other dogs.

MS. KORNBLUT (CONT'D)

It's a simple question of confidence in

one's own authority. Shall I

demonstrate a simple walk?

Be my guest.

MS. KORNBLUT

Class? Even an unruly dog wants to

obey his leader. Marley? Heel.

And she steps off confidently - but Marley is a bit more

confident than she is. He lunges, she pulls, he falls back

on his hind legs, then barrels up and lurches forward.

Ms. Kornblut half-stumbles, half rockets across the park.

She manages to turn Marley around, and the whole process

begins again as they make their way back to the line. Her

face is flushed with embarrassment, anger, and exertion, but

Marley, jowls frothing, is having a ball. It's like a

walking tug-of-war.

With difficulty, Ms. Kornblut manages to return Marley to

John, but not before, as a coup-de-grace, he starts humping

her leg enthusiastically. She struggles, he knocks her down,

and then he buries his face in her crotch and humps her knee.

John and Jenny rush over. John restrains Marley; Jenny helps

up Mrs. Kornblut. She's livid.

MS. KORNBLUT (CONT'D)

That's it! He's out!

He usually just does this with poodles.

(looking at her bad perm)

Maybe it's the hair.

MS. KORNBLUT

He's a bad influence on the others.

Leg-humping is a virus. Once it takes

hold in a group - he has to go!

58 INT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD - DAY

As they follow Marley back into the house.

Well, that was fun.

(to the dog)

Congratulations, Marley. You flunked

obedience school.

You know, John, there is something else

we can do--

(looks at her)

No, no, I'm not doing that to him.

It's painless. And he'll be a lot more

comfortable. It'll calm him down.

Yeah, you know why he'll be calmer?

Because he'll have nothing to look

forward to.

What're you talking about? There are

plenty of other things that'll make him

That's where you're wrong. Trust me,

Jen: I know. I'm a guy. And yeah,

lots of things make us happy, but the

only thing we really look forward to is

sex. Runner up: the possibility of

sex.

Oh, Please. Every book says he'll live

It'll just feel longer.

John, he's out of control. It's the

right thing to do.

John sighs, looks at Marley who's now humping the stuffed

"goofy" that Jenny gave him as a puppy.

59 INT. JENNY'S CAR - DAY

Jenny at the wheel. John in the passenger seat. Marley in the

back, his front paws balanced on the center console.

It won't be so bad, buddy. You'll see.

Sex is overrated.

Marley looks-at him.

Okay, I'm lying, and I think you know

that... so maybe the best thing is to

just not talk about it.

Jenny cuts him a look. He lowers his voice.

Poor son-of-a-bitch.

A guilty John cracks the window just a bit and Marley begins

listing to starboard, leaning against John to catch a whiff

of the outdoor smells. Marley crawls onto John's lap...

Oh, okay, you wanna sit up here...

Marley now jams his nose into the small opening, snorting to

catch the fresh air

Least I can do.

John lowers the window and Marley gets his whole snout out.

Here you go...

John lowers the window again and now Marley sticks his whole

head out, ears flapping behind him, tongue hanging out like

he's drunk.

He's so happy. He has no idea what's

about to happen to him.

Jenny looks over as Marley hooks his paws over the half open

window so that his neck and upper shoulders now hang out of

the car.

He's making me nervous.

He's fine. He just wants a little

Suddenly Marley slides his front legs out the window until

his front armpits are resting on the glass.

John, grab him!

Before John can do anything, Marley is off his lap and

scrambling out the window of the moving car.

He's onto our evil plan, and he's

making a break for it!

But now his butt is up in the air, his hind legs clawing for

a foothold...

60 EXT. INTERCOASTAL WATERWAY BRIDGE - SAME

As Jenny slows down in heavy traffic, John lunges out the

window after Marley, grabs the end of his tail with one hand

so that Marley dangles upside down, outside the car, by his

tail... He trots along the pavement with his front paws...

61 INT. CAR - SANE

Jenny gets the car stopped, HORNS HONKING BEHIND THEM.

Uh, little help here...

John's stuck. He can't pull the dog back in the window and he

can't open the door. He can't let go as angry drivers behind

them are now starting to swerve around them. John hangs on

for dear life...

I got him!

62 EXT. BRIDGE - SAME

As Jenny puts on the flashers and gets out of the car, runs

around to the passenger side... a group of cars drive slowly

by in the other direction, all watching and laughing...

What are you looking at?! He's losing

his balls today! Cut the guy some

slack!

63 INT. SUN-SENTINAL OFFICE - DAY

John sits at his desk, tries to write a column. Sebastian, in

a flak jacket, pauses at his desk...

Strip mall get approved?

Riveting planning commission vote.

Knuckle-biter. 8 to 1.

You up for a beer?

Can't, I gotta finish the column.

Maybe tomorrow?

Can't, I'll be in L.A. Part of that

drug piece I'm doing--

Right. Another time then.

John watches him move off, a secretary giving Sebastian a big

smile as he passes. John sits there another moment, looks at

his desk. A photo of him and Jenny. One of Marley with a flip

flop in his mouth.

John chuckles to himself, then deletes the column, starts

typing a new one.

64 INT. ARNIE'S OFFICE - LATER 64

John sits anxiously across from Arnie who sits at his desk

reading. The editor's expression is grim as he looks up at

John.

I'm really sorry, I'll go back and do

the zoning piece--

The hell you sorry for? It's

hilarious.

John sits back down, looks at Arnie. See, the thing is,

Arnie's face doesn't say "hilarious," but...

I loved it. Getting kicked out of

obedience school, the humping, the

"Great Escape," all of it. Hysterical.

Again, Arnie's face remains dead serious as he passes the

paper back to John.

Run it. As is.

Thank you, sir.

John starts out of the office.

Hey, Gorgan...

Tell him not to feel bad. Sooner or

later, we all lose our balls.

65 EXT. CUBAN RESTAURANT - PATIO - NIGHT

Live music, a sexy vibe. John and Jenny sit outside in the

hot Florida night. Dinner over, John raises his glass...

To two years.

That was fast.

Good, though, right?

Really good.

He lifts out of his chair and kisses her, a long one.

So. What's next?

I was thinking desert.

No, I mean on your list.

My list?

ed,

Remember, when we first got marri

you had this whole checklist, with like

the game plan.

Right...

So what came next?

Let's see... a new car maybe?

afterthat?

We can do that. What was

You sure you wanna know?

Yeah.

well, it was between a new roof and a

baby.

He studies her for a long moment, then...

I can probably live with a few leaks.

Really? Because a leak can turn into

something bigger... and that can be a

big responsibility.

I know.

I was just thinking that we might want

everything fixed before we went to the

next step.

Well, we've already fixed Marley.

Literally.

You're serious about this?

I think so.

JENNY t an

And you know we're not talking abou

actual roof here.

Yeah, I got that.

She looks back at him, finally nods. They are. Then..

Okay. Maybe, instead of tying to have

a baby, we should stop trying to not

have one.

If I'm following you correctly -- and I

think I am -- this is the part where we

go home and get it on, right?

66 INT. BEDROOM - DAY

him.

As Jenny pushes John back onto the bed, starts kissing

Things getting hot and heavy quickly. As they kiss...

Honey?

Yeah...

Did you eat some kibble?

What?

And now they part and we see MARLEY'S HUGE FACE RESTING ON

THE SIDE OF THE BED, watching, panting up a storm.

Marley-- get out of here!

it's fine, he's a dog, he doesn't

what he's looking at.

Oh, he knows, and trust me, he

the hell out of me right now. Go on,

Marley! Get out!

But Marley jumps up on the bed, tries to climb on both of

Marley!

And now they both start laughing as the dog tries to lick

their faces...

67 INT. ARNIE'S OFFICE - DAY

Silence. Arnie reads John's column, his face dead serious.

This is even funnier than the last one.

Thank you, sir.

You're good, Gorgan. And not just the

dog stuff. The piece on the women of

Boca last week. What'd you call them?

Boccahontis.

Hilarious.

John nods, starts for the door...

Is it true what you wrote? You and the

wife are trying to have a kid?

Well, we're not really trying.

How's that work?

Excuse me?

Are you having sex?

Yes.

ant?

With the intention of getting pregn

i guess.

Congratulations. You're trying.

John just stands there. Arnie looks back at him.

I assume you've thought this through?

Yeah, I mean...

68 INT. SUN-SENTINAL OFFICE - DAY

desk.

John walks out of the office, pensive, sits down at his

His PHONE RINGS.

69 INT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD - SAME

Jenny on the phone, looking at a dry erase calendar.

I just thought I'd let you know that

I'm ovulating.

INTERCUTTING: JOHN & JENNY

Oh.

Just in case you wanted to come home.

Like right now.

70 INT. ELEVATOR - DAY 70

In the f.g., stands a harried thirty-something FATHER with a

screaming INFANT in a Bjorn. John stands just behind the

father who bounces in place trying unsuccessfully to soothe

the baby.

Daddy!

And now, another KID, 4-year-old girl, jumps up in and out of

frame...

I wanna push the button!

Daddy can't lift you right now--

(jumps up again)

You said I could push the button!

Alright, okay, I'll just--

He tries to pick her up without leaning over...

Ow! You're hurting me!

Okay, you know what? Never mind, no

button!

A very uncomfortable John now steps forward...

You want me to give her a hand?

Oh-- would you mind?

John lifts the girl up to the panel. She runs her hands,

from top to button, down the panel, pressing every single

button.

Sarah! Goddammit--

And now the little girl starts bawling in concert with the

baby, while a trapped John backs up into the corner.

71 EXT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD - DAY

John gets out of the car. The young Girl next door gives him

a wave as she starts down the sidewalk with her boyfriend.

Hi.

72 INT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD - DAY

John enters and is greeted as usual by Marley who jumps on

him.

Hey, boy.

Jenny?

Out in a sec!

John stands there, Marley looking at him.

(to the dog)

So. This is us not trying.

The bathroom door opens and Jenny walks out in a tiny, silky

two-piece thing...

Hey, Sailor.

She walks into the bedroom. John looks back at Marley as he

follows her into the bedroom.

Catch you later, buddy.

And closes the door on the dog.

73 INT. BAR - NIGHT 73

John and Sebastian sit at the bar.

So the puppy wasn't enough?

Well, technically, we're not trying.

But you know Jenny.

But things are good right now, just as

they are, right?

Yeah, things are really good.

So why change it up with a kid? I

mean, have you already forgotten my

little cautionary tale...

The bomb, right?

Yes. The bomb. And just so we're

clear, the countdown sequence has been

reactivated. By you.

Well, it's been a few months and

nothing's happened. Which actually

makes me wonder if--

Mr. Grogan?

The BARTENDER sets a PHONE down in front of John.

Phone call. I loved that thing you did

on your dog watching you and your wife

have sex? Really funny stuff...

Thanks...

Seriously, man, your stuff is classic.

Well, it's just temporary, but thanks.

John cuts a look at Sebastian, picks up the phone.

Hello.

I just wanted to let you know that

there's a naked blonde in your bed.

Oh. Why don't you two get started and

I'll be there as soon as I can.

Very funny. Can you come home? I'll

make it worth your while.

Oh. Alright then. I'll see what I can

do.

He hangs up. Looks at Sebastian.

Uh, I'm sorry, man, but I gotta jam. I

forgot, I had this thing, I gotta deal

She's calling you home, isn't she?

Yeah. See you later.

John starts out of the bar. Sebastian calls after him.

Tick tick tick!

74 INT. 345 CHURCHILL - NIGHT

Romantic Music on the stereo. John comes in, wearily,

absently pets Marley. He goes into the bedroom. The

bathroom door is open. John sits down on the bed.

You know, this baby thing. I been

thinking maybe we should take a break.

You know? Obviously, it's not

happening. Maybe that's nature's way

of saying it's not good timing.

No sound from Jenny. He struggles on.

Maybe this is a sign that we're not

ready for this. I mean, have we really

thought this through? Because--

He looks up to see Jenny at the bathroom door. From

her back she brings out a home pregnancy test strip.

I'm pregnant.

(PAUSE, then)

Great. Wow, that's... great.

But you just said

Yeah, no, I mean-- okay, this is

definitely awkward now, but...

You wanna start over?

Can I?

By all means.

Thank you. Okay, well... I gotta be

honest, I'm a little panicked.

Are you panicking because I'm

pregnant... or because you're afraid

I'm going to hit you?

Both. It's a twofer thing.

Are you scared?

No. No. Not at all.

(then, looks at her)

Yeah, yeah I'm pretty scared.

(sits down next to him)

Me, too. But we're gonna be okay.

Look at me...

He looks at her. She smiles at him.

We're gonna be okay.

I believe you.

He looks at her stomach, kisses her there...

75 INT. ARNIE'S OFFICE - DAY

As John hands Arnie his latest column...

That's probably the last one about

Marley for a while. But in about nine

months, I'm gonna have a new subject,

might be just as fun. Jenny's

pregnant.

I'm very happy for you. Have you

bought her a present?

What?

A gift, John. She's carrying a child.

Your child. Don't you think that's

worth something?

Uhhh...

You don't wanna make the mistake I did.

Listen to me. There's gonna come a

time, she's fat, she's nauseous, her

ankles are swollen, and she's gonna

look at you, and this is what that look

will mean: "You bastard. You did this

to me. You dick, you ruined me." But

then...

she's gonna remember that little ring,

bracelet, anklet, whatever, that you

bought her, and she's gonna feel

better. Understand?

Yeah.

(indicates the door)

Can I just--

Go ahead. There's a jeweler on the

corner. Mention my name.

76 INT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD - NIGHT

Lit with candles. Jenny and John on the couch. She removes

a beautiful gold necklace from a box and holds it up...

Oh, John, it's beautiful...

She sets it down on the coffee table, then moves close to

him.

Thank you...

She kisses him.

I was just thinking about you when I

walked by the store and saw it in the

window...

That is so sweet.

Put it on...

She turns back to the coffee table and looks around...

Where'd it go? It was right here.

You just put it down. It can't have

And then he stops. Looks off. So does Jenny...

Oh God...

Marley stands a few feet away, looking strangely gleeful. A

glint of Gold in the moonlight dangles from his mouth. They

both get up, start to move towards him...

Hey, boy. Come here. Look what I got

for you.

We don't want any trouble...

Yeah, here's a little something--

(imaginary) treat. Marley

She reaches into her pocket for an moves

looks at her. Is this a trick? He considers. Then he

closer. John tiptoes up behind him, ever so slowly.

I just want to give you a treat and a

big kiss. That's a boy...

Inch by inch, Marley approaches her. But then, behind

Marley, John knocks against a table. Marley freezes.

He made me! Go!

Jenny lurches for Marley, going for his collar, and John

leaps at him from behind. Marley skitters away. Ah, a game!

He wags his tail, prances, sticks his rear in the air and his

puts his head to the ground. John feints, tries to maneuver

Marley back into Jenny.

Jenny finally grabs him from behind. John pries open his

mouth. Nothing. He reaches inside, looks up at Jenny.

77 EXT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD - BACKYARD - MORNING

John grimaces in the morning sun as he watches Marley poop.

He takes a hose and squirts at the deposit until it runs into

the lawn. Nothing.

JENNY (O.S.)

Dr. Jay's sending over a laxative.

78 EXT. 345 CHURCHILL - BACKYARD - DAY

John hoses through Marley's huge orange iridescent poops.

Man, you gotta lay off the mangoes.

You know, years ago, when I pictured my

life, somehow standing in my backyard

hosing down dog crap in search of my

bride's swallowed and recycled ass-

kissing gift just didn't spring to

mind.

79 INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Carefully, Jenny lifts the shiny necklace out of a glass

filled with bleach.

I think it's shinier than before.

Amazing.

Yeah. He did us a favor. And I only

threw up eight times.

My hero.

80 INT. OB/GYN OFFICE - EXAMINING ROOM - DAY

The NURSE arranges the gown on Jenny.

How's that crazy dog of yours?

(smiles at John)

I'm a big fan.

Thank you.

The heartbeat'll be very fast, like a

little train. That's normal.

Shooting Draft  56.

Is it too soon to tell the sex? Not

that I care. He can be any sex he

wants. Male, female, we don't care.

Unambiguous genitalia, if we had our

druthers, but whatever...

Shhhhh... hang on...

She listens for a moment with a little microphone hooked up

to a speaker. Nothing.

Sometimes you,can't hear it, depending

on how the baby is lying.- You're ten

weeks, right?

Next Monday, yes.

Might be a little early for that.

Let's go right to the sonogram. Did

you bring your blank tape?

(waving it, smiling)

Ready to roll.

Let's get a good picture first. It'll

be on the monitor there.

The Nurse begins running the instrument around Jenny's

stomach. John and Jenny peer at the computer screen.

Hmmm. This one doesn't seem to be

picking up anything. Excuse me, I'll

be just a minute...

She leaves. Jenny and John smile at each other, but inside

each of them, a small pinpoint of fear starts to expand. We

wait for a few moments. A pressured silence. And then...

smiles down at

DR. SHERMAN comes in, followed by the nurse,

Jenny.

DR. SHERMAN

Hi, guys. Let's have a look at your

baby, shall we?

(he takes the instrument)

All right, there we go. Good. Now,

look over there. Much better

resolution, right?

Jenny and John, holding hands, look at the computer screen.

They see a sac, which, with a click of the mouse, Dr. Sherman

expands and expands. But it's empty. Jenny tries to smile.

Is there anything in there?

DR. SHERMAN

Not what you'd expect to see at ten

weeks.

Not quite ten weeks.

Dr. Sherman looks at them directly. Kindly:

DR. SHERMAN

Jenny, I'm sorry, but there's no

heartbeat.

John and Jenny are still, silent.

DR. SHERMAN (CONT'D)

One in six pregnancies ends this way.

it just happens sometimes, that's all.

I'm very sorry. But you're young and

healthy and in a couple of months, you

can try again.

Why don't you come by my office on your

way out and we can talk some more.

He exits. John is still holding the blank videotape. He

tries to hide it from Jenny. He leaves. Jenny and John look

at each other.

How could this happen? What'd I do

wrong?

You didn't do anything--

I must have. Otherwise, how could I

lose it?

Jenny, it's not something you have any

control over. It's like the doctor

said, it just happens--

Not to me... I did something wrong. I

know it... I did something wrong. I'm

sorry, John...

Don't say that--

But I am-- I'm sorry--

I don't need sorry. You didn't do

anything!

She turns away and begins to cry. John just sits there,

staring at the videotape in his hands.

Outside in the hall, the door to another examining room opens

and they hear a couple laughing, talking excitedly.

Jenny and John look away from each other, their pain made

even worse.

81 INT. CAR - DAY (MOVING)

John is driving Jenny home.

In a couple of months, we can try

again. Okay?

82 EXT. 345 CHURCHILL - KITCHEN - DAY

John helps Jenny through the kitchen door. Marley follows

them, circles them wildly, then stops, puzzled, as he looks

at them. Jenny goes into the living room; Marley follows

her.

You want some tea?

Hey, you know what I was thinking? We

still have those tickets from your

parents for the honeymoon in Ireland.

We can finally do that.

Take some time off. It'll be fun,

clear our heads, right?

Jenny?

No answer. He goes into the living room and stops cold:

JOHN'S POV - JENNY & MARLEY

Jenny sits on the couch. Marley stands at her feet, with his

shoulders between her knees, his big head resting in her lap.

His tail hangs flat between his legs. His eyes are turned up

at her, and he whimpers softly.

Jenny strokes his head a few times and then, with no warning,

buries her face in the thick fur of his neck and begins

sobbing. They stay like that for a moment, Marley statue-

still, Jenny clutching him to her like an oversized doll.

John stands there, watching Marley take care of her. No

words, just being there. A lesson here. Her head down,

Jenny raises one arm up towards John and John goes to the

couch and wraps his arms around both of them. We then...

FADE OUT.

DEBBY (V.O.)

Oh. He's... big.

83 INT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD - LIVING ROOM - DAY 83

With difficulty, John holds back Marley to protect DEBBY ---

19, glasses, bookish, the house sitter -- from his affection.

Yeah. Close to a hundred pounds.

(re: the leash struggle)

He just wants to say hi. He won't hurt

you. Just stand still and be calm.

You're a dog person, right?

well, actually -

- Ready?

okay?

John releases Marley who springs on Debby, knocking her back.

I'm okay! I'm okay!

He's not supposed to do that. You have

to knee him. Anyway, it won't happen

the whole time. Just maybe when you

come home.

(handing her a binder)

84 EXT. 345 CHURCHILL - DAY

John and Jenny lug their suitcases across the front lawn to

the car, Marley running around them. Debby's glancing

through the binder.

Debby. Welcome to our home! Marley is

a spirited dog who loves interaction.

We've never left him before but we're

sure he'll behave just as he does when

we're at home.

They kiss him goodbye. Get in the cab and go. Debby runs to

Marley, grabs his leash and struggles with all her might to

hold on to Marley.

85 INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

reads about Ireland in the guide book. Jenny sees a woma

with a child. She smiles. No tears.

There are just a few things about

Marley you need to know. He eats three

times a day. If he looks starved, feed

him again. Of course all this food has

to go somewhere.

86 EXT. 345 CHURCHILL - BACKYARD - DAY

Debby looks at the piles of orange poop everywhere.

Use the red shovel and the blue bucket.

Watch your step. Don't worry about the

color. He likes mangoes.

Marley & He Shooting Draft  61.

87 EXT. IRISH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

John and Jenny enjoy the scenery. Sheep in the road surround

their car. Jenny leans out, laughing, and takes a picture.

Marley's ears get a lot of wax buildup.

Once or twice while we're gone, please

use cotton balls and the blue ear-

cleaning stuff to clean them out. Wear

old clothes and try not to breathe.

88 INT. 345 CHURCHILL - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Debby is throwing up in her mouth a little as she cleans

Marley's ears. Marley loves it.

Marley is an excellent watchdog. And

in this neighborhood, that's a good

thing. You can rest easy at night,

knowing he's on the job.

89 INT. 345 CHURCHILL - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Debby, ears plugged, shades over her eyes, weeps in

frustration as Marley HOWLS at the moon.

90 EXT. IRISH TOWN - NIGHT

John and Jenny stop at a bed-and-breakfast for the night.

It's raining softly.

Thunderstorms are his weak point.

Well, one of his weak points. You can

give him sedatives if you think a storm

is arriving. He doesn't like them, so

push them down into his throat as far

as they go.

91 INT. 345 CHURCHILL - NIGHT

Marley is tearing through the house, terrified.

chasing him with a bottle of tranquilizers.

92 INT. IRISH B & B - NIGHT

An Irish widow, MRS. BUTTERLY, leads them to their room.

We do not allow Marley to get up on any

piece of furniture, chew on anything

except his toys, drink out of the

toilet - keep the lid closed and the

brick on the lid -

93 INT. 345 CHURCHILL - BATHROOM - NIGHT

Debby is showering - and then starts SCREAMING. Marley has

stuck his head through the shower curtain and is licking the

water. Debby splashes water at him to make him go away.

Marley, thinking she's playing, scrambles into the tub with

her. She grabs the curtain, and it pops off the curtain

rings one by one as in ",Psycho."

- actually, you might want to keep the

bathroom door closed in general.

94 INT. 345 CHURCHILL - NIGHT

Debby has run out of the bathroom, a towel hastily wrapped

around her. Marley chases her. He leaps - and returns to

earth with the towel in his mouth. Debby SCREAMS.

95 INT. 345 CHURCHILL - NIGHT

Debby is standing on a coffee table, nude, swatting at an

unseen Marley with a bunch of tall artificial flowers.

Other than that, enjoy him! Thanks so

much. Love, Jenny and John.

96 INT. IRISH BEDROOM - NIGHT

Four walls, four different floral wallpapers. Twin beds.

Above one, the Sacred Heart of Jesus. Above the other, the

Sacred Heart of Mary. Crucifixes everywhere you look, and a

HUGE framed picture of Pope John XXIII.

MRS. BUTTERLY

And if you need anything during the

night, I'm right next door. The

blankets are wool. Good heat in them.

Oh, they're electric?

MRS. BUTTERLY

No, not in this house. My brother died

in a fire, God rest him.

In this room, actually. It's been re-

papered. Good night. God bless.

Jenny sits on the bed. The CREAKING is terrible.

Look, I know we haven't had sex

since... you know. But there's no way

we're breaking the streak tonight.

No kidding. 'Cause it's not just God

watching. God, his mother...

(indicating next door)

.and apparently his best friend.

97 INT. IRISH BEDROOM - LATER

They are in separate beds, staring at the crucifix.

It's July, but I think I can see my

breath.

I can't feel my toes.

John gets out of his bed and into Jenny's. Much SQUEAKING.

My God. Shhh.

It's not the mattress. It's the

shrieks of over-sexed souls in hell.

You wanna join them?

He looks at her.

Are you sure, because we don't have

to...

I can't help myself. Knowing it hasn't

happened in this house in 50 years is a

turn-on.

They roll into each others' arms, the bed squeaking.

Maybe she's deaf...

98 INT. IRISH B & B - DAY 98

The next morning. John and Jenny, looking flushed and

relaxed, and slightly abashed, come downstairs. Mrs.

Butterly looks at them sourly. So do the other guests.

They heard us.

No...

He jumps as Mrs. Butterly slams the teapot on the table.

MRS. BUTTERLY

Tea?

(looks him in the eye)

I'm off to Mass.

Mrs. Butterly leaves. John and Jenny look at the other

guests. They smile bravely.

Wow. Any of you hear her bed squeaking

last night? I hope she hits confession

before Mass, that's all I can say.

99 INT. ANOTHER B & B - DAY 99

Another widow, another room, another collection of religious

artifacts. John smiles.

100 INT. A THIRD B & B - NIGHT 100

Jenny sits on the bed, smiles at the NOISE, starts taking off

her shoes. John ushers the Owner out of the room.

101 EXT. CHURCHILL ROAD - DAY 101

John and Jenny pull into the driveway. They see Debby, the

house sitter, on the front steps with her bag packed. She's

tired-looking, beat. She reaches for a pair of crutches.

John gets out of his car, a smile on his face.

Hey, Debby. So how was--

-Debby hurls the binder of instructions at him.

There were eleven thunderstorms while

you were away. Eleven! And you were

right. He doesn't like thunderstorms!

Okay, yeah, wow. Eleven, huh? That is

a lot.

And those goddamned dog tranquilizers

don't work!

Did you give him four at a time?

I mean on humans!

She hobbles to the car, tries to get in with her crutches.

They frustrate her and she ends up beating the ground with

them until she throws them down. She's losing it.

(as she gets in the car)

And just so you know, I am a dog

person. But that's not a dog! That's

evil with a dog face! That's also

humping your leg! Lose my number!!

And she gets into her car and guns it, splintering the

crutches as she peels out. John and Jenny, watch her go,

turn and look at the front door. Marley's face in the little

square window at the top, peeking out at them.

102 INT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD - DAY 102

A THUNDERSTORM outside. John sits at his desk, tries to work

while Marley walks in circles. John looks at him...

It's only thunder...

John goes back to work. We hear more THUNDER, and Marley

starts howling, knocks over a floor lamp... John looks off

towards the bedroom...

Jenny?! Can you help me out here? I

got twenty minutes to file this column!

We follow John as he gets up from his desk, heads towards the

back bedroom...

Jenny?

We follow him into the room, an anxious Marley close at his

heels. She's not here, he turns around just as she steps out

of the bathroom, smiling...

Luck of the Irish...

She holds up a pregnancy test with a clear BLUE line, her

exuberant face lit up by a FLASH OF LIGHTNING. John goes to

hug her, as Marley HOWLS in the b.g., we then...

FADE OUT.

SUPER: "Nine Months Later."

103 INT. 345 CHURCHILL - BEDROOM - NIGHT 103

John and Jenny are asleep. Marley goes through his nighttime

He chews through a sock. He drinks out of the toilet. He

works on chewing through the plastic dog food tub. Another

night and he'll be in. He chases a fly.

Finally he goes to his bed on the floor of the bedroom. He

settles himself down to sleep. He yawns, he scratches, he

closes his eyes. He snores. And then -

He wakes up, suddenly alert. He looks over at Jenny. He

gets up, sits by her side of the bed, and waits.

Suddenly Jenny sits up, rests a hand on her stomach.

She catches her breath, leans over to John.

John. John, wake up.

What?

I think it's time.

104 INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Jenny has finished dressing. Suddenly she yelps in pain,

doubles over. John takes her in his arms.

It's okay.

Ow!

Suddenly, A GROWL. They turn to see Marley glaring at John.

It's okay. I'm not hurting her.

Jenny MOANS again and now Marley's eyes narrow. He takes a

step towards John.

Please don't scream, honey. He'll kill

me.

You put the car seat in this weekend,

right? They won't let us take the baby

home without the car seat installed.

Like I'd forget that.

105 INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 105

Panicking, John is struggling to get the car seat he forgot

out of the box. He starts beating at the Styrofoam. Marley

barks excitedly. John gets an idea, hands him one end of the

box.

Come on, Marley. Help me out here. Do

what you do best...

Unsure, Marley licks the box.

No, don't lick it, eat it! Destroy it!

You can chew through drywall, man! I

know you can do this!

Marley catches on. He starts shredding the box.

106 INT. GARAGE - NIGHT 106

John hurls a suitcase and the partially-assembled, partially-

destroyed car seat into the back seat. He yells:

Car seat's in!

107 EXT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD - NIGHT 107

Jenny is tottering down the walk as John pulls out of the

garage, gets her into the passenger seat.

108 INT. CAR - NIGHT (STATIONARY) 108

Ready?

Yeah. You?

Marley barks from the back seat. They both turn and look at

him. What's he doing here?

109 INT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD - NIGHT 109

John opens the front door, drags Marley in. John gives him a

GIANT BONE-SHAPED CHEW TOY...

Okay. Here... Stay. Be good. Please,

God. No storms. Stay.

110 INT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD - MORNING 110

The chew toy now almost completely gone. Marley sleeps

beside it as we hear A KEY IN THE LOCK and he gets to his

feet, greets John as he comes through the door.

Hey, boy.

111 EXT. BACKYARD - MORNING 111

As John let's Marley out.

112 INT. KITCHEN - MORNING 112

As John sets down a bowl of food, crouches down as Marley

starts to eat.

Here's the thing: in a couple of hours,

we're gonna bring the baby home. And

you'd be doing me a really big favor if

you didn't freak out.

(stands, sighs)

I'm gonna try and do the same thing.

114 INT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD - MORNING 114

As the sun now streams in through the front windows down onto

Marley, who is sound asleep. We hear A CAR DOOR CLOSE and he

raises his head...

A moment later, THE FRONT DOOR OPENS and John comes in and

Marley greets him, jumps up on his chest.

Hey, boy... let's go outside...

115 EXT. BACKYARD - MORNING 115

As Marley relieves himself, John yawning in the b.g.

116 INT. BEDROOM - MORNING 116

As Jenny unpacks her suitcase. Marley bounds into the room

and greets her.

Hello, Marley...

She crouches down, gives him a kiss, rubs his back. And

that's when we hear a small, birdlike chirp and the dog

freezes. Where'd that come from?

We hear the coo again and this time Marley lifts one paw in

the air like a bird dog, and points in the direction of the

car seat that we now see sitting on the bed...

You know what I think would be a

bummer? If he ate the baby...

.Harley & Me Shooting Draft  70.

She moves to the car seat and turns it around so that now we

see the baby for the first time. She smiles at Marley...

This is Patrick, Marley.

Jenny unbuckles Patrick from the car seat and crouches down

beside Marley and lets the dog sniff the baby's toes, then up

his legs, finally his diaper which puts Marley into a Pampers

stupor, the Holy Grail of aromas and Marley's eyes glaze...

See, he's not gonna hurt him.

No, but I'm gonna have to put a lock on

the diaper pail.

117 EXT. 345 CHURCHILL - DAY 117

Garbage day, and the trash piled outside the Grogan house

testifies to the change inside. Empty cartons of diapers,

the packaging from a crib, a stroller, the car seats, the

Pack'n'Play...

118 INT. 345 CHURCHILL - DAY 118

Jenny tries to watch the baby, now crawling around on the

floor and file her column over the phone at the same time.

I have the quote right here--

Patrick crawls over Marley, who's supremely patient as

Patrick takes a fistful of his eye.

Well, have legal call them again and

get a release for it. They told me it

was on the record-- Marley-- Patrick,

that's his eye-- No, not you, Karla,

just get the release. I'll call you

back.

Be gentle, Patrick!

Jenny leans back in her chair, rubs her face. Then...

Laundry.

119 EXT. PARK - DAY

John sits on a bench, Marley at his feet reading "What to

Expect in the First Year." He takes a breath, looks up,

watches a COUPLE make out on a blanket.

120 INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

The baby in his high chair. Jenny sets a few cheerios on the

tray. Patrick picks them up and drops them, we follow them

down...

To where Marley waits, eagerly vacuuming up the cereal. It

continues to RAIN CHEERIOS and we then BOOM BACK UP and see

that Patrick is now eight months old, laughing as he throws

the cereal onto the floor...

121 EXT. BACKYARD - NIGHT 121

John stands there letting Marley out. He looks back at the

house, watches Jenny through the window as she sets Patrick

down in his crib, shuts the light out.

122 INT. 345 CHURCHILL - NIGHT 122

They're both working at their desks. Jenny looks up from her

computer.

I need to go in tomorrow for a few

hours, see my editor. Think you can

watch the baby for me?

Sure.

John looks around the room. The place is a disaster area.

Remember us?

You mean, those younger, skinnier

better looking people? Yeah, I think I

remember them. Vaguely.

Well, I miss them.

He turns back to his work. She looks at him, sets her pad

aside, comes up behind him, puts her arms around him.

They're still here.

He looks up at their reflection in the window, not so sure.

123 INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 123

John and Jenny now asleep on opposite sides of the bed. On

the floor beside John, Marley lifts his head and GROWLS. We

then hear a piercing SCREAM coming from outside. The dog is

already out of the room.

John sits up, immediately starts to get out of bed...

Honey, don't go out there.

Stay here. Call the police.

124 INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME 124

Marley's at the door growling as John, in his boxer shorts,

grabs the dog by the choke chain and opens the door. We hear

another SCREAM coming from a couple houses down and Marley

breaks through the screen, pulling John with him...

125 EXT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD - SPA 125

As other lights come on, NEIGHBORS start to come out onto the

street. John runs to where we see THE TEENAGE GIRL NEXT DOOR

bent over, sobbing, in her driveway beside her car, driver's

door still open. John lets go of Marley and hurries to her.

He said not to scream or he'd stab me,

but I screamed...

And John sees the blood on her shirt. He takes hold of her.

Okay okay okay, I've got you...

Where's your mom?

At work...

Jenny'll call her...

Marley sniffs at the ground, growling more and more

intensely. We hear SHOUTING, "He went that way" as several

neighbors take off running. Marley lifts his head and he,

too, bolts into the night---

Marley! NO!

But he's gone and John has to stay with the girl. We hear

SIRENS as she slides down the car and sits down on the

ground. John sits down beside her, holding onto her...

All this time we've been living here, I

never got your name.

Lisa.

Well, you're gonna be alright, Lisa,

the police are on the way...

John looks off, wondering where Marley is...

126 EXT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD - LATER 126

A crime scene. Jenny, clutching the baby, stands on the porch

watching as an AMBULANCE pulls away. John, now in shorts and

a T-shirt, comes jogging up the walk.

I can't find him anywhere.

Maybe we should get in the car, drive

around.

I'll get the keys...

John's coming into the house when a police cruiser pulls to

the curb in front of the house. A POLICEMAN gets out of the

driver's side, then opens the back and leads Marley out. He

bounds up the walk to the two of them who greet him...

Marley!

Where were you?

We found him outside the 76 station on

Radford. He had the guy cornered in the

men's room.

So you caught the guy?

jig caught the guy. He also gnawed the

barrel of my shotgun, and ate half my

radio mic.

They look at Marley wagging his tail, panting.

Anyway, the neighbors all said he

belonged here, but none of them wanted

to drive him, so...

Thanks for bringing him home.

Helluva dog.

John nods as The Officer heads back to his car. Jenny

crouches down and gives Marley a big hug and a back rub...

My hero.

127 EXT. BOCA RATON HOUSE - DAY 127

An upscale, newer money neighborhood. An OPEN HOUSE sign out

front. John pulls up. He opens the door, holds up a hand to

Marley who sits in the back--

Stay.

--and starts to unhook Patrick from his car seat. Marley

bolts out of the car and heads straight for the house...

Marley!

128 INT. BOCA RATON HOUSE - DAY 128

A REALTOR is showing a COUPLE around the large, empty, new

house. She points out the designer kitchen that looks out

onto the patio and pool, a huge yellow lab now leaping in.

A moment later, we see John, clutching Patrick, enter the

backyard, try to haul Marley out of the pool. He gives up,

heads for the house, opens the back door and peers inside.

Hi.

The Realtor smiles awkwardly at him.

Can I see a set-up, please?

Certainly.

(looks at the baby)

First home?

No, we live up in West Palm, over on

Churchill?

Ooooh. Well, I think you'd find this

neighborhood to be quite a pleasant

change.

And now Marley bolts past him into the house, tracking wet

footprints all over the floor, jumps up onto the REALTOR.

Oh... my... hello...

Hey, who's dog is that?

129 INT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD - DAY 129

John enters, carrying Patrick, supplies to fix the screen.

Jenny?

A wet Marley bounds into the house, heads for the back. John

follows.

130 INT. BATHROOM - SAME

Jenny is crouched on the floor when John appears in

doorway.

Hey. You alright?

She stands up, smiles the best she can.

I'm fine. Where you guys been?

I wanna show you something.

What?

(hands her the set up)

A house.

(before she can react)

It's a little pricey, but I think we

can do it.

John, I know we've talked about it, but

I'm not sure this is the right time.

And when would the right time be, Jen?

After one of us gets stabbed in the

driveway?

C'mon, honey, we're cramped in here.

This was supposed to be our three-year

house, remember?

I know, but we can't afford to buy a

new one.

Sure, we can. With both our salaries--

Yeah, about that... I don't think I'm

gonna be able to keep working.

I'm pregnant.

What? Are you sure?

She steps away, revealing the counter where FOUR PREGNANCY

TESTS are lined up, all with the same result: Positive.

Very.

131 INT. SUN-SENTINAL OFFICE - DAY 131

John sits with Sebastian at his desk.

Already? I mean, how old's the one you

got?

About eight months.

Jesus. Haven't you heard of birth

control?

Yeah, well, sometimes it doesn't work.

You know what else doesn't work? The

one about how "A dog will stop your

wife's biological clock."

Hey, I'm not the one, keeps getting her

pregnant.

John gives him a look, sees Arnie heading into his office,

takes a breath and gets to his feet.

Wish me luck.

I'm sure he'll give you the raise.

How do you know?

He always gives me one.

John just shakes his head, starts for Arnie's office.

132 INT. ARNIE'S OFFICE - DAY

John sits across from Arnie.

Why should I do this, why are you worth

it?

Because I'm doing a good job?

Are you asking me?

Well, since I took over, the column has

doubled in readership...

So you are doing a good job.

Yes, sir.

So why not make it permanent?

You mean, like forever?

That's what the word "forever" means.

Yes.

John, you know how many yo yo's in the

other room would kill to have their own

column? You took a piece of crap About

Towner and turned it into something

fresh.

I hate to break it to you, son, but

you're a good columnist.

I just had this idea about myself, you

know, that I was a reporter.

Yeah, well sometimes life comes up with

a better idea. Tell you what. You

make it a daily column and I'll double

your salary. How's that?

133 EXT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD - DAY 133

A MOVING VAN is parked out front. Marley runs back and forth

as the MOVERS load up the truck, John and and a very pregnant

Jenny supervising. John sees LISA, the girl next door, as she

comes out of her house. She walks over to him.

Hey, Lisa.

Hi.

You're leaving.

Yeah.

well, I don't blame you. I just

thought I'd come over and say--

But Marley comes running over and she crouches down to greet

him. She hugs him a while...

I'm gonna miss you.

John watches as she holds on to him a bit longer, thanking

him as well. John turns away, starts back for the van to

give her a moment. She stands up.

Where you moving to?

Boca.

Huh.

Huh... what?

Nothing. I just... never pictured, you

know, a guy like you moving to Boca.

A guy like me?

Yeah, you know, young, cool, whatever.

So you think I'm young and cool. And

you're not just saying that because I

saved your life?

Actually, a paramedic named Josh saved

my life.

Right. Well, take care, Lisa. Oh,

He reaches into a moving box, pulls out a chewed-up black

Converse.

I believe this belongs to you.

Thanks. I'll have to chew up the other

one to make it match.

(extends her hand)

Have fun down there.

Yeah. It's gonna be great.

134 EXT. BOCA RATON HOUSE - NIGHT 134

OVER...

135 INT. BOCA RATON HOUSE - NIGHT 135

Jenny through the new house asshetries to soothe him.

Shhh, honey. Come on.

John follows now...

Is he wet?

No. And I can't get a burp out of him.

I think it's colic.

Want me to drive him?

We can't do that every night.

From the other room, we HEAR Patrick CRYING, "Mommy!"

Oh, Jesus.

I'll do the washer.

136 INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - NIGHT 136

John sitting on the washer with his WAILING BABY. Not fun.

John looks to where Marley lies in the corner, watching.

Any ideas?

137 INT. KITCHEN - DAY 137

John is opening the cupboards, getting cereal and yogurt into

a bowl for Patrick. Jenny enters with a fussing Conor on her

shoulder...

Can you take him? I just need a minute

to myself.

John takes the baby and instantly Conor starts crying louder.

Happens every time.

You just need to spend more time with

him.

138 INT. CONOR'S BEDROOM - DAY 138

John puts Conor on the changing table, unbuttons his onesie,

checks his diaper. It's wet; he starts changing him. Conor

cries throughout. Jenny enters.

It's okay, I'll do it.

I'm doing it! It's fine! You tell me

to spend more time with him, I do it,

and then you take over because I'm not

doing it right.

I don't want you changing him when

you're mad.

I'm not mad!

He hears himself, lets her change the baby. She takes him,

sits down with him in a rocking chair, tries to nurse him...

Conor, come on... Conor, please...

She finally stops trying, rocks the chair, looks helplessly

at John.

I don't know what's wrong with me.

Mothers are supposed to be able to give

their baby everything.

He's just colicky, Jen. He'll grow out

of it.

Okay, here's an idea, you stay here and

I'll go to work while he grows out of

it.

He holds up his hands, what does he say to that. She looks

up at him a moment.

I'm just tired, alright? Go on.

She then resumes trying to nurse the baby. He walks out of

the room. She rocks back and forth, looks up with a dark

expression as she hears his CAR START.

ARNIE (V.0.)

It's post partum depression...

139 INT. SUN-SENTINAL OFFICE - DAY 139

John sits on a stool in front of'a portable SCREEN while a

pretty female PHOTOGRAPHER adjusts her lights. Arnie sits

nearby on a desk watching the portrait...

Her hormones are all on tilt and she's

depressed. It happens. After my

fourth kid was born, I'd wake up, find

my wife just staring at me with a

mallet in her hand. I thought she was

gonna kill me in my sleep. I still

do...

Did you get her the gift?

Yeah.

Huh. That usually works.

Arnie gets off the desk, says to the Photographer:

Alright, Janice, make him look pretty.

The man's an official columnist now.

Arnie moves off and the photographer looks up from her camera

and smiles at John. He smiles back. She keeps smiling... so

does he... she finally indicates his hair...

You have a Barney sticker in your--

Oh-- thanks.

He rakes his fingers through his hair, grabs the offending

sticker, looks at her...

I must look like hell... I don't think

I've had a full night sleep in two

months.

Stress?

Kids. I got one with colic, and

another, can't make it through the

night without coming into my room every

two hours.

Well, I think you're holding up great.

You look cute.

Really?

Yeah, like a cute, exhausted Dad. It's

adorable.

John just nods stupidly, the dagger so deep in his heart,

he'll never reach it. She smiles at him.

You certainly look a lot better than

Jerry ever looked. I tried to get him

to take a new picture, but he liked the

one they took the day he started the

column, nineteen years ago.

Nineteen years, huh...

And just when he thought one dagger was brutal enough, his

expression goes really pensive. And on that look, we see a

FLASH as she takes his picture and go right to:

140 EXT. BOCA RATON HOUSE - NIGHT 140

John pulls into his driveway, turns off the car and just sits

there.

141 INT. JOHN'S CAR - SAME 141

As John looks at the house... the windows all lit up. Inside

Jenny moves about with the baby over her shoulder as Patrick

chases Marley around the room. John sits in the car, unable

to move, just watching the chaos in the window.

Marley jumps up against the glass, stands on his hind legs,

paws to the window and looks out. He barks and now Jenny

comes up behind him, hauls him off the window and now sees

John sitting in the car. She gives him a look that says

"What're you doing? Get in here!"

John quickly gets out of the car...

142 INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT 142

John and Jenny eat dinner in exhausted silence. Patrick

throws his food on the floor where a happy Marley waits.

Conor starts crying O.S. and Jenny gets up like a robot.

I'll get him.

John leaves the room. Jenny sits there.

143 INT. JOHN & JENNY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 143

John and Jenny are in bed asleep. Patrick comes into their

room.

Mommy?

Jenny wakes up on autopilot.

Okay, honey, let's go back to bed.

She leads him out of the room. And a second later Conor

starts crying. John lies there a moment, then gets up.

144 INT. CONOR'S ROOM - NIGHT 144

Through the doorway, Jenny, her back to us, gently bounces

Conor on her shoulder. John moves into FRAME...

Jen, you okay?

REVERSE - ON JENNY

She's crying, her back to John who's now in the b.g. A

moment, then...

I'm fine.

145 INT. KITCHEN - MORNING 145

John comes into the kitchen just as Jenny takes a chewed copy

of "Good-night, Moon" from Marley's mouth...

You ruined it! Bad dog!

She leaves the room and John looks at the dog.

You just had to eat the book? What,

have you got some kind of death wish?

I'm telling you, you better chill, or

she'll kill you. Right after she kills

me.

146 EXT. GROCERY STORE - DAY

As Jenny loads up the back of the car with bags of groceries.

Patrick, sitting in the cart, looks off and points--

Look!

Jenny turns and sees A BUS, with John's picture on the side,

an advertisement for his column. She watches it pass.

Daddy!

Uh-huh. I see him.

And she goes back to loading the car.

147 INT. BOCA RATON HOUSE - CONOR'S ROOM - DAY

quietly backs out of the room and shuts the door.

148 INT. HALLWAY - SAME 148

As she peers in on Patrick, also napping in his room.

149 INT. JOHN & JENNY'S BEDROOM - DAY 149

As Jenny comes in, Marley following and sits down heavily on

the bed. She looks at Marley as he lays down beside the bed.

Stay.

She now lays down and closes her eyes. A moment of peace.

And then, somewhere in the distance we hear a faint BEEP BEEP

BEEP as some truck backs up. Marley lifts his head, perks up

his ears and listens. Please don't bark, dog. Please don't

bark. BEEP BEEP- And Marley BARKS, bolts out of the room...

Jenny opens her eyes with a start as Marley runs barking

through the house, we hear something CRASH and break O.S.

150 INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

As Marley jumps up against the window and peers out. Jenny

comes into the room, sees a lamp on its side, a cushion torn

open where Marley now stands. she grabs him by the collar--

Why do you do this?! Why do you wreck

everything! Why?!!

She hauls her hand back to hit him, but hesitates, and just

shoves him away from her and storms into the other room for

Conor.

151 EXT. BOCA RATON HOUSE - EVENING

As John pulls up, gets out of his car. We hear Marley

barking in the garage.

152 INT. LIVING ROOM - EVENING

As John comes in, sees Jenny sitting there on the couch.

Why's Marley out in the--

I want that dog out of here.

Okay. I'll take him out.

She looks up at him.

I want you to get him out of here and

keep him out of here.

What'd he do--

I mean it, John. I want him gone. I

want him gone for good.

153 INT. SUN-SENTINEL OFFICES - DAY

A sad John posts a "DOG FOR SALE" sign. A CO-WORKER

sign and smiles.

That the dog in your column? Obed ience

school? Necklace in the poop? Good

luck.

John watches the guy walk off, scribbles a new

it up. This one reads "E F D TO GOOD HOME."

comes up to John.

You giving up the dog? i thought yo u

loved that thing.

Jenny wants him out.

That's harsh, man.

I don't know what else to do. She's

really unhappy. Maybe the dog is just

one too many things.

They're all unhappy. Trust me.

Well... who knows? Maybe you'll get

lucky and nobody'll want him.

John just nods, thinks about that. Sebastian glances around,

then takes John aside.

Listen, there's something I gotta tell

you.

I'm leaving the paper.

What?

I just gave Arnie my notice.

John looks over at Arnie's office, the door's closed.

He's not too happy about it. He called

me an ungrateful quizzling and threw a

stapler at me.

You going over to the Post?

I'm going to New York.

Sebastian smiles. John doesn't move.

The Gray Lady came courting last week.

Times,

I'm talking about the New York

I know who you're talking about.

You don't seem happy for me.

I am. I'm just in shock. I mean, I'm

in Florida because of you. Woodward

and Bernstein. Remember? That was the

idea.

Yeah, that was the idea before you

decided to be the Andy Rooney of South

Florida.

I didn't decide to be anything--

Exactly.

Boom. That hurts John. They stand there a moment,

considering each other, then.

Look, man, you're happy doing your

thing and I'm not trying to piss on

that. I mean it, you're good at it. I

just wanted you to be the first to

know. That's all.

154 EXT. LORI'S HOUSE - DAY

The house where John and Jenny bought Marley. Lori, the

breeder, looks at Marley, sitting in the front seat, shakes

her head sadly.

Marley & He Shooting Draft

155 EXT. PARK - DAY

As John posts some more flyers around the park. He drops a

flyer and Marley, walking beside him, starts to eat it...

Smart boy.

156 EXT. FARM - DAY

"BROWARD COUNTY DOG RESCUE." A refuge for dogs. John fills

out a form...

Yeah, uh... Monday, then. Give us

weekend.

Up to you.

John looks at the dogs in the back, all of them trying to get

his attention.

157 INT. SUN-SENTINAL OFFICE - DAY

John is working at his desk when Arnie drops a few stacks of

letters down.

These are all responses to the column

you wrote last week.

John thinks a moment...

One where you said you may have to give

the dog away.

(looks at the letters)

Oh. I assume they all want me to keep

him.

No. They're all saying they'd take

him.

Arnie moves on and John stares at the letters.

158 EXT. BACKYARD - DUSK

John walks around the yard picking up Marley's various toys,

putting them into a box.

He looks at Marley standing there wagging his tail.

You're gonna be fine, alright. I'll

just be different. Maybe e

it'll, b better, nobody poking your

yanking your tail. Who knows? Could

be better.

159 INT. KITCHEN - SAME 159

Jenny's been watching. She stands there thoughtfully as John

puts the frisbee in the box and resumes the hunt for the rest

of Marley's stuff, the dog following him.

160 INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 1 60

Jenny's sitting on the bed waiting as John comes in.

He's all packed up. Patrick will want

to say good-bye, but Conor's too young

You can't do this.

What do you mean? Three days ago, you

were pretty clear--

I know, but you can't do it. I won't

let you. You can't give away Marley.

Okay, wait. I'm lost. You told me you

didn't want him around. What's

happened?

The fact that you would have done

something like that, for me, that you

love me that much...

well, that blows me away. And we're

not doing this. It was wrong of me to

ask.

He comes over and sits down beside her.

Maybe not, maybe Marley is one thin

too many.

I got overwhelmed, John. I mean, be.

one tells you how hard it's gonna

Which part?

All of it. Marriage. Being a parent.

It's the hardest thing in the world and

no one prepares you for that. No one

tells you how much you have to give up.

me.

I gave up so much of what makes me

But I'm not allowed to say that.

People think you're a bad person if you

say that. But it's how I feel

sometimes, and I need you to know that.

It's not your fault. It's just

something I have to figure out. But

Marley going, that won't fix anything.

(nods, then)

Okay.

Okay.

She kisses him on the cheek, then gets up and goes into the

bathroom. He sits on the edge of the bed, staring down the

hall...

HIS POV -MARLEY

to how they've

At the end of the hall, panting, oblivious

both just been spared.

161 EXT. MIZNER PLAZA - DAY 161

John and Jenny and Marley and the two boys stroll. Feels

good to be out as a family again. Marley wants to greet all

the Boca mini-dogs as they are being walked or carried by

their owners. Jenny leans up against John.

I made reservations at Sunny's.

Thought we could all sit outside.

Sounds perfect.

(takes his arm)

Thank you.

162 EXT. SIDEWALK CAPE - DAY 162

They are seated at an outside table, shaded by a large round

umbrella. John hooks Marley's leash to two of the table legs

as a waiter brings drinks. Jenny holds up her beer.

To a perfect day with my boys.

A blonde Boca Trophy wife, with a poodle on a jeweled leash,

shrieks excitedly as she meets up with another woman, same

type, with another small fluffy'dog. The little dogs yip.

CAMERA BOOMS DOWN to underneath the table to Marley who has

spotted the poodles and is now locked and loaded.

ON JOHN AND JENNY

As suddenly their table suddenly leaps away from them and

starts moving down the sidewalk, crashing into other tables,

banging-into waiters with trays, making a terrible NOISE as

it scrapes over the faux Italian paving stones.

The four Grogans sit facing each other across, their drinks

suddenly in their laps.

Marley is pulling the table, like a dog with a sled, towards

the now-terrified small dogs. He is chugging forward with

every ounce of rippling muscle he has.

Marley!

John hurries after the dog; Jenny stays with the boys.

As Marley-with-table approaches the small dogs, they break

free of their leashes and run. Several innocent bystanders

are knocked off their feet.

There's a florist kiosk in the center of the plaza; Marley-

and-table take out most of the merchandise.

Security guards look around wildly. It's pandemonium, but

Marley is in heaven. He makes a circuit of the entire plaz a,

one poor poodle runs for her life.

Finally, back where Marley started, the terrified toy poodle

leaps into Jenny's arms. Marley tries to brake -

Marley, no!

- and suddenly, he is jerked back. John has tackled the

table Marley's dragging. Marley YELPS and lands on his bac k,

then quickly rights himself, tail wagging, the happiest dog

in the world.

Everyone surrounding them on the plaza has frozen silent.

They all stare at Marley and the Grogans. The poodle jumps

out of her arms and runs to its distraught owner. Jenny's

head is in her hands, her shoulders heaving...

Jen, you okay?

Jenny?

And she slowly looks up, LAUGHING UNCONTROLLABLY, her whole

body racking, tears in her eyes. Her LAUGHTER BECOMES--

--A BABY CRYING and we now go to...

163 INT. DELIVERY ROOM - DAY 163

As a NEWBORN BABY is placed on Jenny's chest...

Boys, say hello to Colleen...

We PULL BACK TO REVEAL: Patrick, now six and Conor four,

standing beside the bed with John. They all crowd around

"mom" as the NURSE now takes a picture. On the FLASH, we...

164 EXT. BOCA RATON HOUSE - DAY

John and the boys plant flowers in front of the house whilehead up like a

Marley, chained to a post, lies in the shade,

Sphynx, the baby, colleen in a portable bassinet beside him.

Jenny comes outside with some sodas for the boys...

John, telephone.

165 INT. BOCA RATON HOUSE - KITCHEN - SANE

166 EXT. BOCA RATON HOUSE - DAY

As John comes back out of the house, looking stunned.

Who was on the phone?

Philadelphia Inquirer.

She looks at him.

They're offering me a job.

As a reporter. I guess the editor was

down here on vacation, read my stuff.

What'd you say?

I said thank you very much, but I'm

happy where I am. I mean, it's a big

change, Florida to Pennsylvania.

Yes, it is.

Anyway.

John smiles at her, then goes to his sons...

C'mon, guys, back to work...

She watches as he kneels down beside the boys, resumes

digging alongside them.

167 INT. ARNIE'S OFFICE - DAY

John reads through a stack of letters...

Well, that's part of the job. To get

reader response.

re?

You notice any recurring themes the

Yeah. We've got a lot of cranks in

Broward County.

Yeah. Including yi12gu the last couple

months.

(he flips through some)

".. .if he doesn't like it here, he

should move"... "more whining

resident malcontent"... "is there

anything good about Florida according

to Mr. Grogan?"

Arnie, I'm a commentator. We've got

issues here. Over-crowding, crime,

immigration tensions, runaway

Florida hasn't soured, John. You have.

What's wrong?

I don't know. Maybe it's turning 40

next week, or maybe...

Maybe what?

Maybe I'm sick of my column. I don't

really think I'm all that interesting.

Are you kidding? You're the comic

voice of South Florida's middle class.

You're a national treasure. Well, a

regional treasure. Municipal treasure,

for sure. You're just a little burned

out. Why don't you take a coupweeks

off? Consider it my birthday present.

168 EXT. BOCA HOUSE - NIGHT

169 INT. BOCA HOUSE - NIGHT

John opens the door. He flicks on the lights and 100 people

shout "Surprise!" There are banners hung from the ceiling,

reading "HAPPY 40TH."

Jenny is standing there, holding Colleen. Conor, aged 5 and

Patrick age 7 run to their father.

Happy birthday, honey!

170 INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - NIGHT

Forty. Jesus Christ...

He looks at Marley a moment, then...

Hey, buddy, you and me are the same

age.

(looks at Marley's face)

You got more grey hair than me,

though...

Mind if I just hang here for a minute?

171 INT. BOLA RATON HOUSE - LATER

As Jenny brings in a cake with 40 candles on it. John tries

not to be too taken aback by the blaze.

Okay, who wants to help me here? Kids?

Marley, you too.

Jenny squats down with the cake, and John and his kids start

to blow out the candles.

172 EXT. BOCA HOUSE - POOL - NIGHT

The guests have gone. John sits in a lounge chair, holding

out a fork so that Marley can lick the cake off of it. Most

of the floating lights have gone out. Jenny comes out.

Okay, tell the truth, were you really

surprised?

Yeah. Thanks, Jen.

She sits down on his lap...

You want your present?

Is it what you gave me last year?

Because that was real nice--

She hands him an envelope.

Happy Birthday.

He opens it, pulls out an AIRLINE TICKET.

A plane ticket?

To Philadelphia. So you can talk to

the editor of the inquirer.

That was months ago--

I called the editor last week. They'd

still like to meet you.

Jenny, I couldn't do that, uproot us.

We've got our friends, the schools...

First of all, you don't even have the

job yet, it's just an interview.

Second of all, you don't have that many

friends.

Thank you. What I was trying to say,

is that our life is here.

Baby, I got news for you, our life is

wherever we are. And you're not happy

here anymore, doing that column.

You're restless, John. I feel it. I

feel it when you read Sebastian's

articles every day. And I feel it when

you sit out in the driveway an extra

five minutes before you come in.

Maybe it's time for a change.

I'm forty, Jen. Seems kinda late for

that.

Not so late.

She stands up in the dark, lifts her dress over her head.

What're you doing?

We're not old, John. We can still

surprise ourselves.

He sits there stunned as she now dives into the pool. She

surfaces and smiles at him.

Hey. You want your other birthday

present or not?

John can't get out of his clothes fast enough. He leaps

the pool and swims over to her, kisses her.

We're not old.

And then we hear ANOTHER splash.

Uh-oh...

And a moment later Marley's head goes bobbing by.

173 INT. SUN-SENTINAL OFFICE - DAY

As John packs up his desk. Arnie sticks his head

office.

Hey, Gorgan.

John smiles to himself, walks over.

I just wanted to say good luck up

there.

Thank you, sir.

Also, there's a good chance that every

piece of advice I ever gave you, may in

fact be total crap.

I appreciate it just the same.

They stand there a moment, awkward. Then...

This would be where a mushier guy would

tell you he's proud of you, give you a

hug, and send you on your way.

Really glad you're not that guy, sir.

Arnie nods, goes back into his office and shuts the door.

174 IN. AIRPLANE - DAY (ON THE TARMAC)

The Grogans are in the back of the plane.

Look. There's Marley!

THROUGH THE WINDOW they can see Marley's crate arriving at

the plane on a luggage truck. Marley is asleep, heavily

drugged. Conor starts banging on the window.

Hey, Marley! We're up here!

He can't hear you with the engine

going.

(aside to Jenny)

Not to mention the tranquilizers. I

think he's already reached his cruising

altitude.

175 INT. PLANE - LATER

The engines ROAR up and the stewardess begins her pre-flight

safety demonstration. John watches her, smiling, relieved

they made it this far, when he freezes.

A MUFFLED MOAN is coming from beneath his feet. Clearly it's

Marley. Passengers near them frown.

is that a dog?

Maybe, I don't know.

Marley's Sad. Marley's our dog. He's

with the suitcases.

John smiles weakly at the Passenger.

What an imagination, huh?

We don't have a dog.

He makes the crazy sign with his finger, gesturing at

Patrick. The MOANING gets worse. John just smiles tightly.

176 EXT. PENNSYLVANIA COUNTRY ROAD - DAY 176

Fall foliage. Beautiful, picture-perfect countryside. The

Grogan family car winds along the roads. Marley has his head

out the window, tongue wagging...

177 EXT. PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE - DAY 177

A two-story country house, no neighbors visible. Trees,

land, woodpile, the whole country living thing. The Grogans

pile out of the car, look at the house. Marley takes off

running...

Marley!

Marley jumps into a pile of leaves, scatters them everywhere,

rolls over onto his back and knocks over a rake, which falls

and breaks a basement window.

And... we're home.

178 INT. PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER - DAY 178

As John is introduced to fellow staff and reporters, most of

them at least ten years younger than he is. He's shown his

desk. John sits down at his cubicle, stares out the window

at the city. His EDITOR, black, John's age, approaches with

a much younger REPORTER...

Hey, John. Settling in okay?

I'm fine, thanks.

Good. I want you to meet Billy...

He indicates the twenty-something guy beside him. John and

Billy shake hands.

Billy's gonna show you the ropes.

You're the Florida guy, right? The dog

columns...

Well, some of them were, but--

Cute stuff. C'mon, I'll show you

around.

179 EXT. PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

January. John wakes up. Marley is whimpering at him.

What?

And then Conor and Patrick burst into the room.

180 EXT. PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE - DAY

White everywhere. The family and Marley trudge into the

snow, unused to their boots and snowsuits. Marley jumps

around, barks like he's a puppy again.

181 EXT. HILL - DAY

The kids slide down the hill in a toboggan. John is at the

bottom to catch them. Up at the house, Jenny calls...

Okay, time for lunch!

I'll bring this in. Go on up.

The kids and Marley head up to the house. John drags the

toboggan up the hill. He pauses at the top and looks down at

the toboggan run. He gets on the toboggan.

Honey, what're you doing?

I can't remember the last time I rode

on a toboggan..

Exactly.

He starts sliding down the hill. Marley runs for him as he

builds up speed...

Marley, no!

But Marley jumps onto John's lap as they get going...

ON THE TOBOGGAN

Flying down the hill. Marley is much heavier than the kids,

and they sail past the place where the kids stopped, through

the woods, barely missing trees and low-hanging branches,

John! The creek!

The toboggan bumps over the crest of a small hill and sails

through the air, landing with a crash on the iced-over creek.

John and Marley tumble into a snow bank on the opposite side.

A moment. But then Marley jumps up and wriggles in delight.

John painfully unfolds himself, checks for injuries. Marley

comes up and romps with him.

Hey... wanna do it again?

John!

182 INT. PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE - NIGHT 182

John shuts off all of the lights, heads upstairs. We follow

him up the stairs. He stops near the top, peers through the

bannister into...

183 PATRICK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 183

From the low angle of the stairs, Patrick lies on his side,

sleeping. And then we see Marley's head rise and reveal

itself as Marley lifts it to look at John standing there.

He'd been laying there on the bed behind Patrick. He looks

at John, knows he's not supposed to be there, but...

That's alright, pal. I won't tell.

We kicked ass down that hill, didn't

we?

John smiles at him and continues up to bed.

184 EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - AFTERNOON 184

Early Spring. The snow has melted. Marley, still as a

statue, sits at the side of the road, waiting. Suddenly, he

stands up and starts to wag his tail.

A moment later, a yellow dot appears on the horizon. As it

gets closer, Marley gets more and more excited as we now see

that the dot is a SCHOOL BUS. It pulls to a stop beside

Marley. Conor and Patrick get off and are greeted by Marley.

Hey, boy.

We HOLD WIDE ON THEIR BACKS as the boys start up the road

towards home, Marley bounding between them, nipping at

Patrick's backpack.

185 EXT. PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE - DUSK

John pulls up as the boys now throw a football back and forth

while Marley leaps into the air, trying to intercept it. John

gets out of the car, claps his hands, holds them up...

Hit me, I'm open!

Patrick throws the ball to John who catches it, mocks stiff-

arms his way to the front steps with the boys now hanging off

him as he gives the play-by-play...

My God, look at Grogan-- two three-

hundred pound linemen literally hanging

off him, but he won't be denied!

And now Marley jumps on them.

Ohhh, out of nowhere, a brutal hit from

the Strong Safety and the unthinkable

happens... GROGAN GOES DOWN...

And he collapses with the boys at the foot of the. steps,

Marley all over them, licking whatever faces he can get.

Colleen comes out the front door, stands at the top of the

steps...

Mommy says dinner and take off your

shoes.

Alright... c'mon guys...

They all get up, start up the steps. Marley follows, takes

one step when his hind legs buckle. John looks back at him.

You okay, boy? C'mon...

Marley tries the second step and again his legs give out. He

looks up at them...

What's wrong with him, Daddy?

Nothing's wrong. He's just tired.

Right, Dad?

John sees the way Patrick is looking at him, knows he's

protecting his little brother.

That's right. Football just took it

out of him. C'mon, let's give him a

hand.

And now the three of them go to Marley, help him up the

stairs.

186 INT. PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER - EDITOR'S OFFICE - DAY

John sits across from the editor.

Too much color.

Yeah, I mean, don't get me wrong, it's

a good piece, but... you're reporting

now, John. I want you to tell the

story, I don't want you to be in the

I'm pretty sure I don't mention myself--

The point is, I still feel you in

there.

John sits there, thinking about that.

All I'm saying is: less you, more

facts.

187 INT. PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE - NIGHT

Marley snores on the floor while John, Jenny and the kids all

watch a movie together. Suddenly, they all take a whiff, then

wince at once...

Marley!

They all begin waving their hands in front of their faces.

I think someone needs to go out.

Come on, boy...

Marley gets to his feet, follows John to the front door.

188 EXT. PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE - NIGHT

Rain falls as John opens the door and Marley trots outside.

189 INT. PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE - SAME

190 EXT. PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE - SAME

As John returns, steps outside, but Marley is nowhere to be

seen. John, claps his hand and whistles...

Marley!

Now Jenny appears in the front door.

What's wrong?

He's not coming.

Marley!

John starts off into the dark...

191 EXT. DIRT ROAD - NIGHT

192 EXT. BARNS - NIGHT

193 EXT. PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

John comes into the kitchen - without Marley.

him with concern... he start out of the room.

He'll show up.

194 INT. UPSTAIRS - BOYS BEDROOM - NIGHT

John is tucking the boys in.

He's just out exploring. You know how

much he likes the woods.

Bobby says dogs, when they're going to

die, they go away to do it. That's

what his beagle did.

And that's true... for beagles. But

not labs like Marley. He's just out

there making trouble somewhere. Don't

worry...

195 INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

John's on the phone to neighbors...

Okay. Well, if you see him... thanks.

He hangs up, goes to the window.

I'm gonna get in the car, maybe drive

(he sees something)

Jenny.

Shooting Draft  109.

196 EXT. FRONT LAWN - NIGHT

John and Jenny run to'a tree at the edge of the property.

Marley lies on the ground, in a hollow, hidden from view from

the hill above. His belly is swollen, his face drawn. It's

clear he's very ill.

It's okay, boy, it's okay...

197 INT. VETERINARY TREATMENT ROOM - NIGHT

John stands with DR. PLATT, a female vet. Marley lies on the

floor in a dog bed, an IV is going into his paw.

DR. PLATT

He's on an IV for fluids and a

sedative.

So what happened?

DR. PLATT

His stomach twisted. He ate or drank

something quickly, took in a lot of air

and his stomach flipped. I got a tube

down which let out some of the gas. I

think i untwisted it.

So he's okay...

DR. PLATT

For now. But once this happens, it

almost always happens again. And if it

does, there's not gonna be anything I

can do. He's too old for that kind of

surgery.

What if it doesn't happen again?

DR. PLATT

More than likely, it will.

But what if it doesn't?

DR. PLATT

I just think you should prepare

yourself that he might not make it

through the night.

Maybe one percent of dogs ever survive

One percent? What's that number based

on?

DR. PLATT

Mr. Grogan--

I'll tell you what it's based on:

regular dogs.

(getting worked up)

Lady, we are so far from 'regular", you

have no idea.

My guy here... He once ate an entire

answering machine, and digested it.

Then went back and ate the phone for

dessert. So don't give me numbers like

"one percent," because you don't know

him. But I do, and I'll see him in the

morning.

We TRACK WITH JOHN as he storms out of the exam room, walks

down the hall, goes through waiting room, then he PASSES US

as he goes out into the dark parking lot, walks to his car

and stops.

We stay BEHIND HIM as he leans with one hand on his car, and

doesn't move.

198 INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

Jenny's sitting at the table looking through a thick album

when John comes in. She looks up at him expectantly.

We're just gonna have to wait and see.

If he makes it through the night, I

think we'll be alright.

He notices the album.

What're you looking at?

Your old columns. He's in a lot of

'em.

John rotates the album for a better look.

You saved these?

Every one.

He looks up at her.

Even on the crappiest day, when the

boys were driving me nuts and the

laundry wasn't done and a hundred other

things were hard, I knew I had this.

(taps the book)

Five minutes of you. Sometimes they

were funny and sometimes they were sad,

or silly or whatever, but they were all

you. And for those five minutes, you

made me feel better.

She gets up, comes over to him, leans down and kisses his

head. Then, as she starts out...

199 EXT. PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE - DAWN

200 INT. KITCHEN - SANE

As John, his head on the table, asleep, pops up at the sound

of the ring and grabs the phone.

Hello?

(listens, then)

Alright. Thank you.

He hangs up, sees Jenny now standing in the doorway, tying

her robe, looking at him anxiously.

201 EXT. PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE - EVENING

As John pulls up. He gets out of the SUV, walks around and

opens the back window and now Marley sits up into view.

Marley's back!

John opens the tail gate just as the kids come rushing onto

the porch, Marley's tail wagging as he's lifted out of the

car and set on the ground, the kids now surrounding him...

202 INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - NEW YORK CITY - DAY

Loft. Downtown. Full of unpacked boxes. A mattress on the

floor. Expensive electronics sit atop their cartons. John

follows Sebastian on a "tour."

Nice place. How long you been here?

Two years, little more.

Sebastian sees John looking at all of the unpacked boxes.

I'm in and out of town so much I really

haven't had a chance to settle in. I

hired a decorator, but she and I got

into a thing and it got messy--

Right.

Beer?

I can't, I still got one more interview

to do.

Sebastian opens the fridge revealing nothing but beer and

hunk of Parmesan.

What's the piece again?

U.N.

Right, you told me that. So you're

down in Philly now, huh?

Just outside. More space for the kids.

Whatta you got, five now?

Three. Here's a picture of

everybody...

John pulls a photo from his wallet, hands it to Sebastian.

Jenny's holding up.

(ignores the callowness)

Yeah, she's great. And that's Colleen

our youngest...

What's with the ladybug get-up?

(smiling at the memory)

Oh, yeah, that's a funny story. She

had done this pageant at her preschool

two weeks before, but she didn't wanna

take off the costume, plus Marley went

ballistic for the antenna which is why

it looks like he's trying to eat her

head.

Yeah, that is funny.

(returns the photo)

So I was thinking later on maybe Thai?

There's this new place in the meat

Packing District. How's that sound? Be

just like old times.

John stands there a moment, feeling the distance between

them.

Uh, well, actually I'm headed back home

later today.

Oh.

In fact, I should probably get going...

(awkward Man-pat hug)

Good seeing you, man.

For sure.

(walking him out)

Oh, hey, be sure to check out the

Delegates Lounge at the U.N... Great

Mojitos, really hot interpreters.

Thanks for the tip.

And John goes out the door. Sebastian takes out his

blackberry, dials...

Hey, it's Sea-bass. What're you up to

tonight?

Oh. No, that's cool. Another time

then.

He hangs up, stands there in the middle of his big, empty

apartment a moment. He then dials another number.

Hey, it's Sea-bass. What's going on?

203 EXT. PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE - DAY

As a cab pulls away and John carries his suitcase up onto the

porch.

204 INT. PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE - DAY

He sees a note ("PICKING UP THE KIDS. J"), and peers into:

Where Marley is up on his hind legs, eating something off the

counter. John puts his keys down, but Marley doesn't react.

John sneaks up behind him. Marley keeps eating the grilled

cheese sandwich off the plate...

Marley? Hey, boy.

Marley looks up briefly as if he heard something, but then

returns to eating. John is right behind him. John reaches

out and touches Marley, and Marley jumps, totally guilty.

Then he turns and greets John.

What's the matter, boy? You didn't

hear me? Huh?

He looks at the dog a moment, thoughtful, then...

Let's go for a walk.

205 EXT. HILL - DAY

As John walks Marley off leash up a hill. At one point, John

has to stop and wait for Marley to catch up.

Come on, boy, just a little further to

the top...

Marley comes up, panting, eyes wet and happy. John looks at

him, can see how tired he is.

You know what, this is a good spot

right here.

John looks out at the valley below, settles down onto the

damp earth beside Marley.

Let's just sit for a while.

The two of them sit there, looking out at the beautiful

countryside below. John strokes Marley for a moment. Looks

at the grey hair, the tired eyes that now look back at him.

Hey. So... you're gonna tell me,

right? When it's time? Because I

don't wanna make that decision on my

own. So you just let me know when

you're ready, okay?

Marley rests his chin on John's arm.

Okay.

206 INT. UPPER HALLWAY - NIGHT

Jenny is at the top of the stairs.

Marley?

(turns to John)

Have you seen him?

207 INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

John and Jenny find Marley lying peacefully in front of the

dying fire.

I guess I could move his bed down here.

John sits down beside Marley.

Man. He's always slept with us. Now

he can't even make it upstairs.

He looks pretty comfortable to me.

I'll go get his bed.

Hey Jen? why don't you grab a blanket

for me, too.

She nods, starts back up the stairs. John grabs a pillow

from the couch and lays down beside Marley.

This is a good spot. I may never sleep

upstairs again.

JENNY (O.S.)

Hey. Scooch over.

He looks up and see that Jenny's brought a blanket. She lies

down with them. John puts his arm around them both.

Marley's tail begins gently pounding the floor.

Just like old times.

THUMP. THUMP.

208 INT. PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER - DAY

John sits across from his editor.

It'd be twice a week. Six hundred

words.

And what's the subject?

Everyday stuff. The stuff we all go

through. But funnier.

I don't get it. I thought you came

here to be a reporter.

I did, but I think we both know that

isn't me. I'm a columnist. A good

one.

A SECRETARY sticks her head in the office...

John-- your wife's on the phone. She

says it's important...

I'll be right there.

(to the editor)

209 INT. PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE - DAY

Jenny on the phone, looking out into the backyard.

I can't get him back inside. He's

lying out there in cold... and he won't

move...

210 EXT. PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE - DAY

Late afternoon. John's car pulls up.

211 INT. PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY 211

Jenny and Patrick are sitting on the floor. Marley is lying

on the dining room floor, breathing heavily.

Patrick came home and we got him here.

Dr. Platt said if he's comfortable,

leave him here for a while and see.

But he's no better.

John kneels down by Marley, who looks at him but doesn't wag

his tail or lick his hand. He runs his hand over his coat -

then over his stomach, the dog flinches.

I'm taking him in.

The kids all come into the room, Colleen carrying a stuffed

sheep.

Is he sick again?

Yeah, he is, honey. But I'm going to

take him to the hospital and they'll

try to make him better.

Conor bends down, nuzzles Marley's face.

Get better, Mar.

You can take Lamby, okay?

(she puts the stuffed animal

next to him)

But don't chew her other ear off.

Patrick leans down, hugs Marley tightly and whispers right in

Goodbye.

When he looks up at his father, John can see that Patrick's

crying, that he knows what the other two don't.

212 EXT. VET'S - NIGHT 212

John lifts Marley out of the car. Marley seems a little more

alert.

You wanna walk?

He sets him down gingerly. Hesitantly, Marley walks over to

the tree that countless dogs have peed on, sniffs it, then

looks around. John looks around, too. It's a crisp spring

night in Pennsylvania. Takes a breath...

Nice night, huh?

Marley looks around, then looks at John. There's something

in his expression. John nods, knows what he's saying.

Okay, boy.

(as Marley moves close)

Okay.

John, his heart breaking, bends down to carry Marley up the

front steps of the clinic.

213 INT. VET WAITING ROOM - LATER

John stands as Dr. Platt comes out...

DR. PLATT

I did everything that worked before.

But no luck. There's still surgery,

--not strong enough.

DR. PLATT

There's blood in his stomach. The

lining might be compromised. I don't

know what we'll find if we go in there

anyway.

Can you give me a minute? I need to...

I need to call my wife.

214 EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

John's on his cell phone...

It's me. It's the stomach thing again.

Nothing's working. They could do

surgery, but...

215 INT. PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Jenny listens to John on the phone.

I know.

Jenny nods as tears come. They stay on the phone, quiet,

just being with each other. Finally:

I love you, John.

216 EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

I love you.

217 INT. EXAMINING ROOM - NIGHT

John enters. Marley is on the table, zonked out. Dr. Platt

has put a blanket on the cold metal table so Marley is warm.

DR. PLATT

I'll give you some time.

She goes. John stares down at Marley. Takes the stuffed

lamb out of his pocket, places it under a paw. When John

puts a hand on his flank, Marley's eyes flutter open. His

tail THUMPS gently.

Hey, buddy.

He pets Marley's head, runs his hands all over Marley's body.

His coat, still shedding. His tail. He takes up each paw,

each ear, remembering and memorizing at the same time. He

leans down, puts his nose on Marley's neck and breathes him

in. Then he goes around, squats down so he's on Marley's

level. He looks into Marley's eyes.

Listen, you know all that stuff we

always said about you? What a total

pain you are? The world's worst dog?

Well, don't you believe it. Don't

believe it for a minute. You loved us,

every day, no matter what. And that's

a pretty amazing thing.

(he leans in)

Look, I don't know where you're going

from here, but you remember this:

You're a great dog, Marley. You are a

great dog.

218 INT. PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT 218

In the BEDROOM, Jenny sits on the bed, the phone in her hand,

waiting, we BEGIN PULLING AWAY DOWN THE HALLWAY.

219 INT. CLINIC - NIGHT 219

Dr. Platt is in the room now. John, his hand on one of

Marley's paws, kneels on the ground, looking at Marley,

Marley lays on the table, looking right back at him.

DR. PLATT

He won't feel a thing. He'll just slip

away. Are you ready?

(looking at Marley)

We're ready.

Dr. Platt inserts the needle into the I.V. and presses the

plunger.

220 INT. PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE - NIGHT 220

As a pajama-clad Patrick slips a tape into the VCR...

221 INT. CLINIC - NIGHT 221

As we now HOLD ON MARLEY'S EYES, slowly beginning to close.

222 INT. PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT 222

As Jenny sits vigil by the phone, we CONTINUE PULLING BACK.

223 INT. PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE - NIGHT 223

As Patrick sits alone in the dark living room, his face

illuminated by the TV, as he watches SILENT IMAGES from

Grogan family home videos:

TWO-YEAR-OLD PATRICK rides on Marley's back through the house

at 345 Churchill, young Marley's tail knocking over

everything within range, toddler and dog both joyous.

224 INT. CLINIC - NIGHT

As Marley's eyes finally close. The CAMERA drifts to John's

hand, stroking Marley's side. Dr. Platt listens to Marley's

heart and says:

DR. PLATT

He's gone.

FROM ABOVE, the dog on the table, the doctor discreetly going

to the side, and John laying his head next to Marley and

putting his arms around him as we now...

225 EXT. PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE - DAY

As the five Grogans walk across the-property. Colleen sits

on John's shoulders. They reach a clearing where we see a

small grave has been dug. John sets Colleen down...

He's wrapped in his blanket...

So he'll be warm.

You guys want to read your letters?

Mine is a picture. Of me and Marley.

And grasshoppers. And ice cream.

Mommy wrote what I said. "Dear Marley.

I will never forget you, forever." And

those are kisses.

It's beautiful, honey. He'll like it.

Drop it in. Conor?

Conor reads his piece of paper.

"Dear Marley. I loved you all my life.

I hope you like heaven and that there's

lots to chew on. Your brother, Conor

Richard Grogan."

John puts his hand on Conor's shoulder as Conor drops in the

letter into the grave.

Patrick? Do you want to say anything?

He knows.

I'd like to give him something.

Jenny reaches behind her neck and unclasps the gold necklace

John gave Jenny when she first got pregnant.

This little necklace has been on quite

a journey.

John smiles at her, remembering. So much shared history.

Your dad gave this to me to celebrate

the beginning of our family. But you

know what? Our family had already

begun.

She looks into the grave, gently sets the necklace atop the

blanket, lets her hand rest there a moment, then stands up.

Good-bye, Clearance Puppy.

226 EXT. GRAVE SITE - LATER 226

John puts few big stones on top of the tamped-down earth. He

sits on his haunches beside the grave, looks up at the house

across the yard.

JOHN'S POV - THE HOUSE

All lit up. We see the kids sitting by the fire while Jenny

moves about the kitchen getting dinner ready.

John sits there watching them. watching his family. The

family that both he and Marley grew up in.

He gives the fresh dirt a final, loving pat and then, as the

last bit of sun goes down, he stands up, and heads for home.
