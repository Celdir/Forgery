MUSIC IN: "Stone Cold Dead in the Market" by Louis Jordon

THE TITLES appear on black. They are intercut with CLOSE-UPS

of a fighter's body.

EXAMPLES:

Feet move.

Credit over black.

Body lunges.

Credit over black.

Fists swing and punch at the air.

Credit over black.

WE CATCH A GLIMPSE of young JAKE LAMOTTA.

INT. BARBIZON PLAZA THEATRE - DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT (1964)

JAKE LAMOTTA, wearing a tux, is shadow-boxing.

We are unsure of where he is -- he moves in and out of the

shadows. At 42, he's overweight and out of shape, but the

balls of his feet still pop up and down like they were on

canvas and his tiny fists still jerk forward with short

bursts of light. He is rehearsing a nightclub monologue.

INT. CLEVELAND ARENA - NIGHT (1941)

Bam! JIMMY REEVES, a fast, black middleweight, jabs LAMOTTA,

19 years old, in the face. JAKE staggers forward. No matter

how hard LAMOTTA is hit, no matter how often, he always

staggers forward -- like a bull. The bell sounds.

Battered, JAKE slumps on the stool in his corner.

It's September, 1941. Europe and Asia are already at war.

Young SOLDIERS, freshly recruited, dot the hostile audience --

each screaming at the FIGHTERS in the ring.

Suddenly, words are exchanged, a GIRL screams, and a SOLDIER

and a CIVILIAN stand and start swinging.

AND IN THE RING: JAKE LAMOTTA takes a swig of water and spits

blood into the bucket his younger brother, JOEY, holds for

him. TONY, his trainer, works the cuts.

The bell sounds for the tenth. JAKE pulls himself up and

charges at REEVES.

REEVES slides away, jabbing, punching, piling up points.

In JAKE's corner, JOEY stands and yells at JAKE:

JAKE suddenly corners REEVES and unleashes a desperate, wild

alley-fighting attack. One ferocious punch after another.

The SPECTATORS go wild; everyone's up for the kill.

REEVES staggers, then falls to the canvas.

The REFEREE counts:

The GAMBLERS call out new odds; ten to one for REEVES, the

underdog. JOEY, excited, sees that time is running out and

steps in front of the bell. He swings his arms, pretending

not to realize he literally holds back the TIMER's arm for a

few seconds. This gives JAKE more time for a knockout -- but

not enough. JOEY is pushed back and the bell rings at the

count of nine, ending the match.

Boos and cheers. The BETTORS scramble back to the BOOKIE to

get their money.

JAKE dances around the ring, kissing his gloves and thrusting

them toward the CROWD. JOEY rushes out and hugs him.

The ANNOUNCER steps into the ring with the mike:

The ANNOUNCER holds up REEVES' arm as his corner tries to

lift him off the canvas -- still out cold. TWO ATTENDANTS

bring in a stretcher.

JAKE is stunned. He still prances around, now trying to

figure out what happened. He raises his arms in victory, and

the FANS go crazy, cheering, ripping chairs out, fighting

with the COPS, throwing bottles and junk into the ring.

PEOPLE go into the ring.

REEVES being placed on the stretcher.

A ringside OFFICIAL signals the ORGANIST and she starts to

play the "Star Spangled Banner." REEVES is carried out.

Only then do JOEY and TONY escort JAKE out of the ring.

EXT. WEBSTER AVENUE AND 169TH ST., THE BRONX - NEXT DAY

It's a rough neighborhood, inhabited primarily by welfare

cases and street kids.

In the street, two young PUNKS, 13 or 14 years old, exchange

words and start to fight. Their FRIENDS cheer them on. SALVY

and JOEY turn the corner.

A COP goes over and starts to break up the fight.

The KIDS yell.

SALVY and JOEY continue to walk a little faster, giggling.

INT. JAKE AND IRMA'S KITCHEN - DAY

JAKE, bandaged from the REEVES fight the night before, sits

at the kitchen table (he's had a few glasses of wine) while

his wife, IRMA, 19, cooks at the stove.

JAKE gets up and pokes at the frying steak with a fork.

She slams the steak onto his plate, and reaches back to the

stove.

He starts to eat the steak. He takes a drink of wine.

EXT. JAKE AND IRMA'S APARTMENT BUILDING/TENEMENT - DAY

SALVY and JOEY approach the building.

They stop at the doorway.

SALVY leaves. JOEY goes into the building.

INT. JAKE AND IRMA'S KITCHEN - DAY

JOEY is knocking at the door. IRMA opens it.

JOEY sits next to JAKE at the kitchen table. JAKE has a drink

in his hand, and tears on his face.

JAKE goes into the living room. IRMA looks at JOEY. JOEY

follows JAKE.

INT. LIVING ROOM

JOEY walks up to JAKE.

JAKE holds out his scarred hands.

JAKE pauses. IRMA watches from the doorway.

JOEY wraps it around his fist. IRMA watches. JOEY hits JAKE

with his right. JAKE holds fast.

JOEY hauls off and lands him a real belt. JAKE rolls with it

and stands firm.

JOEY hits him again.

JOEY hits him again.

JOEY hits him again. JAKE holds fast. JAKE starts to walk

away.

EXT. GLEASON'S GYM - NEXT DAY

Gleason's, a small gym and fight club, stands on 149th Street

and 3rd Avenue above a small sandwich shop.

Each day BOBBY GLEASON posts a small sign alongside the door

listing the fighters who will be working out. JAKE's name is

posted at the top; the other names are unmemorable.

INT. GLEASON'S - DAY

Gleason's has a single sparring ring and ten training bags.

About a dozen managers train their fighters out at Gleason's.

For 50 cents, spectators sit in the gallery and watch the

workouts.

JAKE is sparring with JOEY in the ring. They've been working

out for a while now. The bell rings ending the third round.

JAKE prances about the ring waiting for the bell to sound

again.

At that moment, SALVY, along with two other young "BUTTON"

MEN (actually, they are very young -- about JOEY's age) enter

the gym. They are well-dressed (over-coat, ties, suits,

flashy rings, etc.). They say hello to some PEOPLE by the

door. JAKE looks over and notices them. SALVY looks over to

the ring.

JOEY waves back.

JAKE nods to SALVY very cold. SALVY notices and can feel that

he's not exactly wanted there by JAKE. JOEY notices the same

and becomes a bit nervous.

SALVY sits down near the ring but not as close as he'd like

to. His two friends, FRANKIE and GUIDO, sit nearby also.

JAKE goes to JOEY's corner.

JOEY doesn't answer.

SALVY and the OTHERS see JOEY being chewed out by JAKE. They

begin to feel unwelcome at the gym.

The bell sounds. JAKE is more aggressive now as he corners

JOEY. JAKE swings away with body punches. JOEY can't block

them. SALVY and the OTHERS watch.

The bell sounds again. With that, SALVY and the OTHERS start

to leave.

JOEY, dazed, turns to wave.

JAKE watches them leave.

The bell sounds again. JAKE hits JOEY a few more solid body

punches. JOEY gets angry and fights back with a flurry of

punches which have no effect on JAKE. JAKE laughs.

JOEY fights back, but it's no use.

JAKE laughs. The two continue to swing it out, as SALVY

watches unseen from the doorway.

EXT. SHOREHAVEN POOL - DAY (1942-43)

The Shorehaven Pool, spic-and-span in the summer sun is the

closest thing to a country club in the Bronx. An eight foot

fence stands between the pool and the street.

JAKE, wearing slacks and a sportshirt, hangs out with the

"BOYS" near the bar area. Older, "MADE" MEN play cards. A

young FAN walks by and says:

At the opposite end of the pool where the GIRLS gossip, and

sunbathe, JOEY swaps small talk with VICKIE, a school girl,

about 15. VICKIE is a knockout.

SALVY, FRANKIE and JUNIOR are with VICKIE and her FRIENDS.

They joke with JOEY.

JAKE watches SALVY and VICKIE.

JAKE'S P.O.V.: JOEY is talking (PAN) to VICKIE. VICKIE

giggles. JOEY stands and walks over to JAKE.

JAKE watches VICKIE.

INT. JAKE AND IRMA'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - LATE NIGHT

The scene ends on VICKIE as JAKE watches her.

INT. JAKE AND IRMA'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - LATE NIGHT

JOEY sips a drink as JAKE knots his tie. IRMA enters from the

bedroom.

JOEY lifts his eyes up.

JOEY opens the door to leave. JAKE follows.

INT. JAKE AND IRMA'S APT. BUILDING - HALLWAY - LATE NIGHT

JAKE and JOEY hurry down the stairs. IRMA shouts after them.

INT. JAKE AND IRMA'S BUILDING - GROUND FLOOR - LATE NIGHT

They exit to street.

EXT. JAKE AND IRMA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - STREET - LATE NIGHT

JOEY and JAKE come out of the building and start walking down

the street.

IRMA opens the window on the second floor right above them,

and shouts out to them:

JAKE and JOEY walk faster down the block, pretending that

IRMA must be shouting at someone else.

She throws a bottle at them. It smashes in the street.

EXT. WEBSTER HALL - NIGHT (AN HOUR LATER)

ESTABLISHING SHOT.

INT. WEBSTER HALL - NIGHT

A neighborhood dance is in progress. A small BAND is playing

while mainly OLDER COUPLES dance. There are TWO PRIESTS

present. The younger people are divided into two groups --

the BOYS, who are dressed in suits and ties, and spend most

of their time at the bar area -- and the GIRLS, who are in

evening dresses, and spend most of their time dancing

together.

Some of the more popular GIRLS are surrounded by "WISE-GUYS."

There are tables near the dance floor with "set ups" (bottles

of Scotch, rye, and a bucket of ice) on them. These tables

are the "bases of operation" for different neighborhood

groups, as if they were street corners.

JAKE and JOEY are walking toward a table. VERA, a young

neighborhood girl, blocks their way as she bends over to talk

to some GUYS at a table. VERA's well-built, and knows it.

JOEY tries to move one way; VERA again blocks his way. This

little game goes on for a few seconds, then:

JAKE starts to move forward; JOEY stops him.

JOEY cups his hands and grabs VERA's breasts. VERA squeals,

covers her breasts, and moves back. JOEY and JAKE walk past

her. JOEY smiles.

JOEY and JAKE sit down at an empty table.

MOVING SHOTS

JAKE tries to find her -- Camera pans until we find her. JOEY

points out a distant table. He spots VICKIE with a couple of

other GIRLS . VICKIE locks beautiful and is obviously having

a good time.

As they watch, WE SEE, from JAKE's POV:

SALVY, FRANKIE, and JUNIOR show up at VICKIE's table. They

are in overcoats and hats and don't sit down. They are

obviously on their way to bigger things than a neighborhood

dance -- and VICKIE and her GIRLFRIENDS are glad to go with

them. They get up to leave.

SALVY, FRANKIE, JUNIOR, VTCKIE and the other TWO GIRLS leave

the dance hall. JAKE, unseen, follows them to the entrance

way, as they go out onto the sidewalk.

EXT. WEBSTER HALL - NIGHT

JAKE watches as SALVY ushers everyone into his Cadillac, and

then drives off.

JAKE stares after the car for a moment, then goes back

inside.

EXT. SHOREHAVEN POOL - DAY (1942-43)

JAKE and JOEY get out of their Packard convertible and walk

over to the fence surrounding the pool. VICKIE is by the

pool.

VICKIE comes over to the fence.

JAKE puts his fingers through the fence.

PAN to car.

She starts to go.

She turns. JAKE kisses his hand and holds it up to the fence

by her lips.

EXT. SHORE ROAD - DAY

JAKE drives his Packard convertible down Shore Road. VICKIE

sits in the passenger seat, her blonde hair blowing in the

wind. VICKIE feels JAKE's eyes all over her, and loves it.

On the radio, Bing Crosby sings "Just One More Charce."

EXT. MINIATURE GOLF COURSE - DAY

JAKE parks across the street from the new miniature golf

course on Shore Road. The Shore Road course is one of the

best. The first green features a pink windmill.

JAKE and VICKIE get out to cross the street.

A bus heads toward them.

JAKE holds up his hand.

The bus stops for them as they cross the street.

EXT. THE FIRST GREEN - DAY

JAKE sets VICKIE's ball on the tee facing the windmill.

JAKE hands VICKIE the putter, then moves behind her and puts

her hand on the club.

VICKIE swings and the ball rolls into the center of the

windmill. VICKIE breaks free and follows her ball. JAKE

follows.

VICKIE bends and looks under the windmill.

JAKE bends and looks.

JAKE takes VICKIE by the arm.

JAKE throws his putter on the next green.

EXT. ARTHUR AVENUE APARTMENT BUILDING - BRONX - DAY

JAKE and VICKIE pull up to a tenement.

JAKE dashes around the car to open the door for VICKIE.

They enter the building.

INT. ARTHUR AVENUE APARTMENT - DAY

JOSEPH LAMOTTA, SR. is finishing his Sunday dinner with a

glass of wine as JAKE and VICKIE enter.

JAKE is anxious. VICKIE is scared.

JOE stares at him. JAKE grasps VICKIE's arm firmly.

INT. ARTHUR AVENUE APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY

The bedroom is a few rooms away from the kitchen. JAKE closes

the door. (There is a warm light in the bedroom.)

The room is sparsely furnished. On the bureau, there is a

large framed photo of the boxing brothers: JAKE and JOEY

LAMOTTA. (JOEY wears a suit in the picture.)

JAKE puts VICKIE on the bed and removes his jacket and tie.

He pushes her against the bed and gently undresses her. They

make love.

INT. OLYMPIA STADIUM - DETROIT (FEB. 5, 1943)

JAKE is fighting SUGAR RAY ROBINSON. (It's their 2nd match.)

WE SEE highlights of the fight: JAKE is fighting ferociously,

but SUGAR RAY is a formidable opponent. AN ANNOUNCER'S VOICE

gives a blow by blow description. JAKE takes a lot of

punishment from SUGAR RAY -- until the 8th round. Then, JAKE

nails SUGAR RAY with a savage left. JAKE chases SUGAR RAY and

pounds him with a left and a right. SUGAR RAY gets in a right

cross. They stand toe to toe, fighting. Then, JAKE lands a

left to SUGAR RAY's stomach, and knocks him through the

ropes. JAKE goes after SUGAR RAY, but the REFEREE stops him.

SUGAR RAY gets back into the ring and sinks to one knee,

while the REFEREE counts to 9. The bell sounds.

TIME CUT: THE ANNOUNCER calls out that JAKE is the winner.

JAKE throws kisses. The CROWD goes wild.

INT. GLEASON'S - DAY (1943)

JAKE's press conference.

FIVE REPORTERS meander around the gym, waiting for JAKE to

finish sparring. They are not thrilled with their assignment.

JAKE is not thrilled with having them there.

The gallery is spotted with the usual BRONX TYPES. The lone

exception is VICKIE, dressed very well, very sensual, and

quite content to watch JAKE make his SPARRING PARTNERS' lives

miserable, despite their head and belly protectors.

JOEY is off in one of the corners arguing with ONE of the

REPORTERS:

The bell sounds, ending the sparring round.

JOEY walks over to the ring. The REPORTER follows not far

behind.

JAKE nods his head, steps out of the ring, and goes directly

over to the REPORTER, who is about to say: "Hi, Jake."

JAKE turns to VICKIE, smiles, and prepares for his next

SPARRING PARTNER.

INT. ARTHUR AVENUE APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY (FEB. 1943)

JAKE, wearing pleated dress slacks, sits on the edge of the

bed examining his muscle tone.

He studies his small fists. Squeezes each knuckle. Twists his

wrists. Clenches. Unclenches.

VICKIE steps out of the bathroom wearing a nightie and

panties.

JAKE watches VICKIE approach him. He respects her as he would

a shrine; he slowly removes her sheer nightie.

His round hands caress her smooth skin. He glides his bruised

knuckles across her shoulders, pride on his face.

She kisses his bruised knuckles sensuously, then his bruised

face.

He touches her breasts as she removes his trousers.

She pulls off his shorts. VICKIE is now getting excited. She

kisses his chest and licks it.

She does.

She caresses his broad shoulders and runs her hand along his

erection.

JAKE's lips are trembling. He quickly turns his back on

VICKIE, goes into the bathroom, and gets a full glass of cold

water.

VICKIE watches as he puts his erection in the glass of cold

water. She is shocked and surprised.

JAKE grabs her again and kisses her. Then, gently but firmly,

he turns her around and pushes her out. (It's starting again,

and he must stop it.) He goes back the bathroom and closes

the door.

INT. OLYMPIC STADIUM - DETROIT (FEB. 26, 1943)

This is JAKE's rematch with SUGAR RAY (their 3rd fight). AN

ANNOUNCER's VOICE gives a blow by blow description.

THE FOURTH ROUND: JAKE is in serious trouble. SUGAR RAY

knocks him with a hard right, then a series of rights and

lefts. JAKE is punched all the way across the ring, but stays

in there.

THE SEVENTH ROUND: JAKE, coming on strong, forces SUGAR RAY

into his own corner, then lands a left hook to his chin.

SUGAR RAY drops, and takes a nine count. This time, however,

the blow does not have a crippling effect on SUGAR RAY;

instead, he comes back and outboxes JAKE.

TIME CUT: THE ANNOUNCER calls out the decision: SUGAR RAY is

the winner. JAKE is stunned. The CROWD boos so loud and for

so long that THE ANNOUNCER is unable to introduce the

fighters in the next bout.

INT. OLYMPIA STADIUM - DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

JOEY and TONY are in the dressing room. JAKE sits on the

table, dejected. His hand is being examined by a DOCTOR. TWO

HANGERS-ON are also present.

TONY goes to the door.

MARIO comes back from the door.

They exit.

INT. BATHROOM NEAR THE DRESSING ROOM

JAKE, now alone, goes into the bathroom. He looks in the

bathroom mirror. After a pauseg, he touches his newly

acquired bruises and bandages. He combs his hair.

We hear the beginning of an early Frank Sinatra song. This

song carries over onto the following MONTAGE.

MONTAGE

This MONTAGE covers the period between 1943 and early 1947.

It shows JAKE hard at work fighting all the tough guys he

can. Each of the fights will be introduced by the

corresponding title card from the "Big Fights" film showing a

boxing glove with the fighters' names and the places of the

fights superimposed on it. The actual fight images will be

black and white newspaper photos JUMP CUT together to

simulate real action. For example: In still #1 JAKE is about

to land a punch on an OPPONENT.

Still #2, and the punch lands, distorting the OPPONENT's

face, sweat spraying out everywhere. Live sound effects

accompany these stills.

The fight stills are INTERCUT with 16mm black and white home

movies of JAKE, VICKIE, JOEY, etc. (to be shot in 16mm black

and white).

It'll go something like this:

A) JAKE VS. FRITZIE ZIVIC at the Detroit Olympia (January 14,

1944)

B) JAKE, VICKIE, and JOEY, wearing sunglasses, pose in front

of a Cadillac. (1944)

C) JAKE VS. SUGAR RAY ROBINSON at Madison Square Garden

(February 23, 1945)

D) JAKE and VICKIE getting married. (This will be a black and

white still photo, posed especially for the occasion.) (1945,

New Jersey courthouse)

E) JAKE VS. SUGAR RAY ROBINSON at Comiskey Park, Chicago

(September 26, 1945)

F) JAKE and VICKIE on vacation -- very loving. They are

dancing, and he allows her to knock him into the pool. Then,

JAKE gives VICKIE a present by the poolside. She opens the

box and takes out a white garment and turban. She kisses

JAKE.

VICKIE dressed in the outfit. She looks very much like Lana

Turner in "The Postman Always Rings Twice." She kisses JAKE.

(1946)

G) JAKE VS. JIMMY EDGAR at Detroit (The University of Detroit

Stadium) (June 12, 1946)

H) JOEY's marriage. JAKE and VICKIE are there as witnesses.

(Could also be a still photo as D was.) (1946)

I) JAKE VS. BOB SATTERFIELD at Wrigley Field, Chicago

(September 12, 1946)

J) JAKE and VICKIE in front of their new Pelham Parkway

house. It is an affluent, split-level house, an idyllic scene

-- stone terrace, freshly cut lawn, etc. JAKE carries VICKIE

inside.

JAKE and VICKIE with their two boys JACK, age 2, and JOEY,

age 1 in the backyard of the Pelham Parkway house; they are

having a cookout. JOEY and his WIFE and their two children (a

BOY and a GIRL about the same ages as JAKE's) are there also.

(1947)

K) JAKE VS. TOMMY BELL at Madison Square Garden (March 14,

1947)

INT. PELHAM PARKWAY HOUSE (1947)

WE SEE an early model, round screen television. Nearby an old

radio. On it, Sinatra is finishing the song we heard in the

preceding montage.

JAKE enters, and turns down the volume on the radio. WE SEE

JAKE's living room; it is late forties modern.

JOEY and VICKIE are seated around the coffee table, which is

near the television. There are some remnants of a snack on

the table. JAKE's TWO BOYS are playing nearby.

VICKIE, amazed, gets up to leave.

JAKE glares at her.

VICKIE rounds up the kids and takes them into the kitchen.

(MOVING SHOT).

WE SEE VICKIE in the kitchen angrily throwing things around.

We clearly see the tension as she cleans up, muttering to

herself.

JAKE comes into the kitchen. He tries to make up with VICKIE.

She plays hard-to-get. They begin to tease each other.

INT. COPACABANA LOUNGE - NIGHT (1947)

A COMEDIAN is in the middle of his act. JAKE, VICKIE, JOEY,

and JANET sit at a nearby table. JANET, an attractive blonde,

is are of JOEY's girlfriends; the moment you set eyes on her,

you know this is not his wife.

The lounge is very crowded. The COMEDIAN interrupts his

routine to point out that JAKE LAMOTTA is in the audience,

and even tries a little harmless joking at JAKE's expense.

There is applause. JAKE smiles, and gives a hesitant wave.

JAKE waves a fist at the COMEDIAN, good-naturedly playing

along with the joke -- even though he hates it.

JOEY, VICKIE, and JANET are amused.

JAKE Smiles. They all drink.

SALVY, a little older, but still young-looking, and dressed

even better than when we last saw him (flashy rings, etc.),

comes over to their table. He walks around like he owns the

fucking place. JAKE hates it.

They respond. JAKE is cold towards SALVY.

SALVY goes on his way to COMO's table.

As SALVY walks away, JAKE turns to VICKIE.

JAKE gives him a suspicious look. JOEY feels uneasy.

Drinks arrive at their table.

JAKE looks up but can't see where COMO is. JOEY gets up.

JOEY goes to COMO's table in the rear of the lounge. JAKE

slides over and watches. JOEY shakes hands with COMO. SALVY

is there at COMO's table. JOEY comes right back.

JAKE doesn't like the idea, but goes along with it anyway.

ANOTHER ANGLE: COMO's table. JAKE comes over.

JAKE sits. SALVY smiles and nods to JAKE. JAKE barely nods

back.

JAKE just stares, holding his anger in.

There is a pause.

Another pause. TOMMY smiles and moves closer to JAKE.

TOMMY sips his drink.

INT. PELHAM PARKWAY HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

VICKIE is in bed trying to sleep. JAKE comes out of the

bathroom half-dressed, and sits on the edge of the bed

(preoccupied). Silence.

VICKIE freezes.

INT. WORTH STREET BASEMENT - DAY

TONY JANIRO, wearing boxer trunks, steps off the scale.

Commissioner COL. EDDIE EAGAN, a white-haired, heavyset man

in his mid-forties, calls out the weight.

The basement of the New York Boxing Commission on Worth

Street is a sparse room, crowded with REPORTERS, TRAINERS and

MANAGERS.

JAKE steps on the scale. He looks weak and woozy. After the

customary adjustments, EAGAN calls out:

There's a commotion in JAKE's camp. JANIRO smiles.

JAKE, JOEY, and TONY confer.

JAKE gets off the scale and enters the men's room. An

OFFICIAL follows him.

INT. THE MEN'S ROOM

JAKE forces himself to urinate.

INT. WORTH STREET BASEMENT

JAKE comes out of the bathroom, and gets back on the scale.

LAMOTTA stares at JANIRO.

JAKE throws JANIRO a kiss.

INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT

It's the last round and JAKE is pouring it on a beaten and

virtually helpless JANIRO.

The CROWD chants:

HALF THE AUDIENCE is already on its feet. The kill is

imminent -- and they love it.

JAKE lands one blow after another. He is relentless.

Several rows back, TOMMY COMO, SALVY and SEVERAL OTHER "MADE"

GUYS sit with sober looks on their faces.

JAKE moves in fast, and with a powerful barrage, smashes

JANIRO's nose -- plastering it against his left cheek.

The final bell rings. JANIRO, his legs all rubber, staggers

back to his corner.

JAKE prances about, kissing his fists and throwing them to

the CROWD. JOEY rushes out, throws JAKE's leopard skin robe

over him and embraces him. TONY follows. JAKE looks right at

COMO and SALVY.

AN ANNOUNCER steps into the center of the ring:

JAKE, weak from losing the weight and winning the fight,

still manages to prance around the ring victoriously.

VICKIE, now near the ring, throws kisses to JAKE.

He bends down and gives her a kiss through the ropes.

INT. COPACABANA - NIGHT (1947)

JOEY is at the bar with a DETROIT PROMOTER and JACKIE CURTIE.

The DETROIT PROMOTER introduces JOEY to JACKIE CURTIE.

SALVY and PATSY arrive with VERA, SANDY (two neighborhood

girls), and VICKIE. They go to a nearby table.

The bar area: JOEY sees this.

The table area: JOEY arrives at SALVY's table. VICKIE is

nervous. There is a cold exchange of'"hellos."

There is an awkward silence as he grabs VICKIE by the arm and

takes her over to the hat-check area.

She starts to go back to the table.

VICKIE pulls away from JOEY, and goes back to the table.

The table area: JOEY arrives at the table. He grabs VICKIE.

As the conversation gets louder, PEOPLE begin to notice.

PAUL, the owner (a tough-looking, well-dressed guy), and some

BOUNCERS also become aware of the argument.

JOEY goes for SALVY. PEOPLE react.

The GIRLS begin to scream. VICKIE exits. JOEY notices her

leave, and calls after her.

PAUL comes over and stops the fight.

SALVY and JOEY give each other looks. JOEY goes out after

VICKIE.

EXT. COPACABANA - NIGHT

JOEY looks up the street for VICKIE. She is gone.

SALVY and PATSY come out of the entrance.

After a few moments, PAUL and the BOUNCERS from the Copa come

out. The BOUNCERS pull PATSY away. They try to separate SALVY

and JOEY, but can't.

JOEY savagely beats SALVY on the Copa steps and in the street

against the parked cars.

SALVY tries to fight back, but JOEY is too tough for him.

SALVY hits the pavement. JOEY kicks him.

PAUL, PATSY, and the BOUNCERS finally pull JOEY away. PATSY

tries to go after JOEY again, but PAUL stops him.

JOEY looks back at him, and then walks away.

INT. THE BACK ROOM OF THE DEBONAIR SOCIAL CLUB

The room is furnished with a few round tables and some

chairs; it is somewhat reminiscent of an old-fashioned candy

store.

TOMMY COMO, SALVY, PATSY and JOEY are present. SALVY's face

is bruised from the beating JOEY gave him.

SALVY, JOEY, and PATSY shake hands.

SALVY and PATSY exit.

There is a pause.

EXT. SHORERAVEN POOL - DAY

Another day. JOEY, fully clothed, opens the gate and looks

around.

JAKE is sitting alone near the deep end. JOEY walks over to

him.

INT. WORTH STREET BASEMENT - DAY

As BILLY FOX steps off the scales, EDDIE EAGAN calls out:

JOEY removes JAKE's leopard-skin robe as he steps on the

scale. The REPORTERS crowd around.

JAKE'S HANDLERS urge him with words of encouragement as they

walk toward his dressing room.

INT. JAKE'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY

EAGAN walks over.

EAGAN taps JAKE on the shoulder.

JAKE glares at EAGAN as the COMMISSIONER walks away.

INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT (NOV. 14, 1947)

The old Garden is packed. The EX-CHAMPS, the PRESS, the

OFFICIALS, the MOB GUYS, the FANS -- they're all here.

The FIGHTERS are announced. BILLY FOX and JAKE touch gloves

and return to their corners.

FOX is taller and has a longer reach than JAKE.

The bell sounds and the FIGHTERS come out. FOX goes to the

head; JAKE goes to the body.

FOX lands a solid blow to JAKE's jaw, but LAMOTTA is unfazed.

FOX is surprised. In the past, his opponents have gone down

when he connected.

In the audience, COMO, SALVY, and some other BOYS watch with

interest.

JAKE moves in with a rapid series of trademark body blows.

All of a sudden, FOX is wobbly. JAKE goes for the head, then

cuts his punch short. FOX is about to go down.

JAKE throws his arms around FOX to make sure he doesn't fall.

The REFEREE breaks them apart and FOX remounts his attack.

JAKE bicycles into a corner and lets FOX work him over.

FOX connects: once, twice, three times. JAKE barely defends

himself -- but he doesn't go down either.

The CROWD starts to smell a fix. There are calls from the

AUDIENCE.

JAKE's corner. JAKE is acting stunned. TONY, not aware of

what's going on, is slapping JAKE.

The sign reads "Round Four." JAKE is in the center of the

ring taking a relentless pasting from FOX. JAKE's arms hang

at waist level... FOX lands one blow after another. The stink

of a fix permeates the arena.

JAKE is furious that FOX can't deck him. He curses through

his mouthpiece (as he absorbs blow after blow):

Boos and catcalls echo through the Garden. This is not even a

fight. The REFEREE, realizing this, steps in between FOX and

LAMOTTA, waves his arms and signals that FOX is the winner by

a technical knockout.

As he does, JAKE spits his mouthpiece in disgust at FOX and

struts back to his corner.

JAKE, JOEY, and TONY are already on their way out of the

arena as the REFEREE declares FOX the winner.

COMO and the OTHERS, satisfied, get up to leave.

INT. JAKE'S DRESSING ROOM - MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT

As a REPORTER and a PHOTOGRAPHER come through the door, WE

SEE and hear a commotion in the hall behind them. They rush

in, look, and stop by the door. There is silence -- except

for JAKE'S uncontrollable sobbing. The atmosphere is like

that of funeral.

JAKE is seated behind the rubbing table. He is still in his

leopard-skin robe. His head hangs low as he sobs.

The PHOTOGRAPHER snaps a picture. The HANDLER motions to him

to stop, and then goes and sits near the door. The REPORTER

still stands near the doorway, seeming quite stunned by the

scene he is witnessing, but nevertheless continuing to

scribble away on his pad.

JOEY, standing near JAKE, has his back to everyone; his

shoulders are shaking, his lips are tightly drawn. He cries

soundlessly. TONY is pacing nearby.

The REPORTER leans over to the HANDLER and whispers.

JAKE, still buried in his robe, becomes aware of the hum of

voices and shouts out:

The REPORTER and the PHOTOGRAPHER leave. JAKE continues to

sob.

INT. PELHAM PARKWAY HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

INSERT: CLOSE UP of a Daily News Headline from November 22,

1947: "Board Suspends LaMotta."

JAKE, dejected, sits on the couch. In front of him, on the

coffee table are scattered several newspapers -- including

the one with the headline we have just seen.

JOEY paces in front of JAKE.

JOEY goes into a boxing stance.

JAKE, out of reflex, sticks out his hands. As he does, JOEY

feigns a hit and falls onto the floor -- "out cold." JAKE

looks down at him.

JOEY pops to his feet.

EXT. BOOK-CADILLAC HOTEL, DETROIT - DAY (1949)

It's raining outside the stately Book-Cadillac.

A banner above the door proclaims.

INT. BOOK-CADILLAC LOBBY - DAY

The lobby is chaotic: FIGHT PEOPLE and SPORTSWRITERS mill

anxiously about. Something's in the air.

The BELL CAPTAIN pages:

MR. WILLIAMS, THE DETROIT PROMOTER last seen in the

Copacabana Lounge, answers the page.

WILLIAMS listens on the phone a moment, then hands it back to

the BELL CAPTAIN and announces:

A groan goes up from the lobby.

INT. LAMOTTA'S SUITE - DAY

JAKE's suite is modestly decorated and consists of a living

room and two bedrooms.

DR. PINTO is there sewing up a pork chop.

JAKE, shadow-boxing in sportswear, paces back and forth.

TONY watches him. VICKIE sits quietly on the sofa, sipping

some wine.

JOEY is on the phone.

JOEY cuts the line off, then leaves the receiver off the

hook.

JAKE goes into the bedroom.

JOEY goes over to the DOCTOR.

INT. THE BEDROOM

JAKE is alone. There is a knock at the door. JOEY opens it

and pokes his head in.

JOEY opens the door wider. TOMMY COMO is at the door with

JOEY. JAKE goes over to the door.

COMO turns to go. He says goodbye to everyone in the living

room. He goes over and kisses VICKIE. JAKE watches this from

the bedroom doorway.

She goes to the bedroom doorway. JAKE grabs her arm, pulls

her in, and slams the door.

JAKE has her by the night table now. They are edging their

way to the wall.

JAKE pushes her against the wall. The lamp falls. There is a

loud crash. She tries to move away. He grabs her by the

throat and pins her against the wall. She's gagging.

JOEY looks in and then starts to come over.

He pushes her again. VICKIE tries to get away, but can't

move.

JOEY has his hand on JAKE's arm, trying to pry it away from

VICKIE's throat.

TONY and the DOCTOR watch from the doorway.

VICKIE's eyes close. JAKE releases his grip. JOEY helps

VICKIE. JAKE watches this.

EXT. BRIGGS STADIUM - NIGHT (JUNE 16, 1949)

Bright floodlights illuminate the arena. The weather's clear

and the stadium is filled with cheering fight FANS.

An ANNOUNCER steps into the center of the ring and begins ti

introduce the many CELEBRITIES that have gathered for the

fight.

DAUTHUILLE jumps into the ring.

While WE HEAR him introduce the boxers and celebrities, WE

SEE a rapid MONTAGE: JAKE preparing for the title bout:

PRE-FIGHT MONTAGE

A) JAKE and GROUP arrive in the dressing room.

B) In his bathrobe, JAKE puts on his boxing shoes.

C) We see a pan with raw steak in it. JOEY drains the blood

(juice) into a glass and JAKE takes a long, slow swallow.

D) REPRISE of IMAGES from PREVIOUS SCENE (SLOW MOTION) - NEW

ANGLE.

TOMMY COMO shakes JAKE's hand in the bathroom doorway. VICKIE

kisses COMO. Jake watches.

Many cheers.

E) DR. PINTO injects a hypodermic needle filled with

novocaine into each of JAKE's fists.

F) JOEY massages JAKE's neck.

G) JAKE's hands are bandaged

H) REPRISE of IMAGES from PREVIOUS SCENE (SLOW MOTION - NEW

ANGLE)

JAKE strangles VICKIE in the bedroom, then releases her.

JOEY looks after her, but the IMAGE makes them look as if

they're making love. Jake watches.

I) JAKE puts on his cup and trunks.

J) MARIO laces up JAKE's gloves.

K) JAKE, ready to fight, a towel draped around his head,

bounces on the balls of his feet. He starts walking down the

corridor from his dressing room, surrounded by MARIO, JOEY,

DR. PINTO and his HANDLERS. He enters the stadium.

INT. BRIGGS STADIUM - NIGHT

JAKE, wearing his leopard-skin robe, is pushed through the

CROWD by JOEY, MARIO and his HANDLERS. He's still shadow

boxing.

JAKE steps into the ring to both cheers and boos (many still

remember the Fox fight). JAKE raises his gloves.

JAKE shakes hands with the assembled CELEBRITIES and EX

CHAMPIONS.

JAKE glances at VICKIE who is sitting in the third row. She

is nervous.

The opening bell sounds. CERDAN and LAMOTTA touch gloves and

begin to fight.

JAKE is hot: there's no stopping him tonight. He fights like

a man possessed.

CERDAN clinches JAKE to avoid his brutal body blows. JAKE

pushes him out of the clinch in disgust.

There are no more boos. JAKE has won over the crowd.

END OF ROUND NINE. JAKE is working over a bloody CERDAN.

Punches to the body, then to the head, then back to the body.

The bell sounds.

JAKE walks back to his corner and sits down. JOEY is

ecstatic:

JAKE doesn't have the chance. The REFEREE, standing in

CERDAN's corner, waves his hands signaling the end of the

fight.

The REFEREE holds up JAKE's hands as THE ANNOUNCER takes the

mike:

JOEY is all over him. TONY helps VICKIE through the MOB.

In his corner, CERDAN holds his head in his hands and says,

"My title, my title!"

The OFFICIALS clear a circle as they bring over the jewel

studded championship belt. JOE LOUIS fastens the belt around

JAKE's waist.

JAKE touches the oversized belt with his bloody gloves. Tears

fall across JAKE's huge grin as he holds his hands high in

the air. It is the most glorious night in his life.

EXT. "JAKE LAMOTTA'S" - NIGHT (1956)

The name "Jake LaMotta's Lounge" is emblazoned in neon across

a lounge/liquor store on Collins Avenue, Miami's main drag.

JAKE's bar is across from The Rooney Plaza, one of Miami's

more prestigious hotels.

Fifties cars are parked outside the club.

INT. "JAKE LAMOTTA'S" - NIGHT

JAKE LAMOTTA, 34 years old, wearing a tux, steps in front of

a large painted wall mural of the Cerdan fight as he enters

his club.

The Lounge is dominated by a large circular bar. Featured

entertainers perform on a raised platform in the center of

the bar.

The club is half filled with SPORTS, ENTERTAINMENT and MOB

TYPES.

The small BAND plays a routine fanfare as JAKE steps onto the

platform. He takes the mike with one hand and silences the

BAND with the other. The applause dies out as he speaks:

About HALF THE PATRONS are listening; of them, HALF are

laughing, SOME a little too loud.

LINDA hands him a drink.

He indicates the blow-up behind him and waits for applause,

of which there is some.

The AUDIENCE applauds.

More applause.

Then, suddenly, falling into character... he quotes lago's

speech in Othello.

OR, ALTERNATE SPEECH:

INT. JAKE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY (1950)

JAKE is struggling with his later model ten-inch RCA TV. He

fools with the dials, then slaps the side. The bluish video

image comes and goes. JOEY watches JAKE fix the TV.

JAKE has a half-eaten sandwich in his hand.

VICKIE enters the house, surprised to find JAKE home.

JAKE looks up at her. (She goes over to him and kisses him.)

MOVING SHOT.

JOEY gives VICKIE a polite peck on the mouth. MOVING SHOT.

JAKE watches JOEY kiss VICKIE. VICKIE notices JAKE'S

reaction.

VICKIE goes into the bedroom to take off her coat. On the

stairs, MOVING SHOT:

JAKE leans over the TV.

JAKE stares at JOEY.

JAKE looks up at JOEY.

MOVING in on JOEY, JAKE'S P.O.V.

PAUSE.

There is a pause. (Move in on JOEY, JAKE'S P.O.V.)

JAKE'S P.O.V., MOVING SHOT as JOEY leaves. JAKE goes into the

bedroom.

INT. THE BEDROOM

JAKE walks over to VICKIE. (MOVE in on VICKIE - JAKE'S P.O.V.

becomes her shot.)

JAKE holds onto her, but she gets away.

JAKE catches her.

VICKIE escapes and locks herself in the bathroom.

He breaks down the door.

She finally manages to push him away.

VICKIE takes JAKE's hand and hits herself. JAKE is stunned.

JAKE starts to walk away. VICKIE goes after him.

JAKE is gone.

INT. JOEY'S PELHAM PARKWAY HOUSE - DAY

JOEY is at the kitchen table eating lunch with his family.

His wife, LENORE, her hair done up in pin curls, sits next to

him. JOEY's TWO KIDS sit across the table from them,

bickering.

Suddenly, JAKE comes through the front door, goes directly to

the table, grabs JOEY, lifts him into the air, and starts

hitting him.

JAKE keeps hitting JOEY. The KIDS start to cry. LENORE wants

to stop the fight, but is afraid to get too close.

JAKE drags JOEY into the living room, and pushes him onto the

floor.

VICKIE rushes into the house, past LENORE and the TWO KIDS

who are screaming even louder now.

JOEY is knocked out. LENORE goes over to him and holds him.

EXT. JOEY'S PELHAM PARKWAY HOUSE - DAY

VICKIE gives JAKE a final push out the door and then slams it

in his face.

JAKE is left alone on the front steps.

INT. JAKE'S PELHAM PARKWAY HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EARLY

EVENING

JAKE sits alone in the darkness.

VICKIE lets herself in. She comes and stands behind him.

There is a pause.

There is a pause.

INT. STEAM BATH - NIGHT

The steam is oppressively thick. It must be 140 degrees.

JAKE, nude, does push-ups on the floor. His body is bathed in

sweat.

He pushes himself up, then collapses. His eyes are glazed

over from lack of strength.

He makes his way to the door and pounds on it.

TONY opens the door and gets on his knees beside JAKE.

INT. JAKE'S PELHAM PARKWAY HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

VICKIE is seated on the sofa, reading newspapers. JAKE is

pacing.

INT. OLYMPIA STADIUM, DETROIT - NIGHT (SEPT. 13, 1950)

The LAMOTTA-DAUTHUILLE middleweight championship is told

through the eyes and words of the RINGSIDE ANNOUNCER. JAKE is

not doing well.

In the ring, JAKE looks like he's on queer street. Bouncing

off the ropes, opening his jaw to DAUTHUILLE. But

DAUTHUILLE's punches lack strength. JAKM is playing possum.

AN ANNOUNCER holds up JAKE's victorious hand. He seems as

surprised as everyone else.

TONY throws JAKE'S robe around his shoulders as THE ANNOUNCER

calls out:

The CROWD cheers. JAKE raises his arms in victory.

INT. JAKE'S DRESSING ROOM - OLYMPIA STADIUM - NIGHT

It is after the fight. TONY, VICKIE, and OTHERS are in the

room. Some PEOPLE are leaving. Congratulations are heard.

TONY puts away JAKE's fight gear.

JAKE, half-dressed, looks troubled.

VICKIE goes to the pay phone in the hall, and dials long

distance.

JAKE is nervous, but follows VICKIE.

JAKE can't answer.

JAKE can't answer.

There is a click as JOEY hangs up.

JAKE stands there, and finally hangs up the phone.

INT. "JAKE LAMOTTA'S" - NIGHT (1956)

JAKE gulps down the last of his Scotch.

LINDA brings him another Scotch.

JAKE sips his drink.

JAKE takes another drink.

INT. JOEY'S PELHAM PARKWAY HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (FEB.

14, 1951)

LENORE, JOEY's wife, watches the 6th Robinson-LaMotta fight

on JOEY's new television console.

JOEY walks by on his way to another room, but stops to watch.

LENORE is not a fight fan, but is caught up in the fight,

anyway.

The bell sounds, and a Pabst commercial comes on:

INT. CHICAGO STADIUM - NIGHT

TONY is wiping JAKE off in his corner.

In the other, SUGAR RAY'S TRAINER pats down ROBINSON's

pompadour as he says:

ROBINSON nods.

The bell sounds and the FIGHTERS step onto the canvas. They

look at each other before the boxing starts -- they both know

the inevitable outcome. ROBINSON smiles.

INT. JOEY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

ROBINSON makes his move. His arms are a blur, swinging

rapidly but accurately.

JOEY and LENORE are suddenly silent.

On the TV, WE SEE that ROBINSON has JAKE up against the

ropes. He's giving JAKE a pier six beating. It's the Fox

fight for real.

JAKE's face is so soaked in blood that it's impossible to

pinpoint the cuts.

As the REFEREE stops the fight, JOEY sighs with relief.

INT. CHICAGO STADIUM - NIGHT

LAMOTTA, a bloody and beaten fighter, walks over to the

victorious ROBINSON and puts his arm on his shoulder.

ROBINSON, receiving congratulations from every direction,

takes time to turn to JAKE and say:

EXT. JAKE'S MIAMI HOUSE - DAY (JUNE 2, 1954)

ESTABLISHING SHOT. The house is quite large, and has

beautiful landscaping and a swimming pool.

INT. JAKE'S MIAMI HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

JAKE, wearing sportclothes that can't hide his paunch, and

VICKIE, wearing a dress and looking her best, sit in the

living room with their THREE CHILDREN (the TWO BOYS, and also

a GIRL, about two years old).

A still PHOTOGRAPHER clicks pictures of JAKE and VICKIE as

TWO REPORTERS talk with JAKE.

VICKIE poses dutifully.

JAKE cuts in:

INT. "JAKE LAMOTTA'S" - NIGHT (1956)

JAKE, an empty glass in his hand, stands on the bar platform.

He's wearing a white tuxedo jacket with a red rose in the

lapel. His tuxedo shirt is stained. He continues his

monologue.

JAKE's onstage version of "That's Entertainment" differs from

the backstage version. It's not just that he's a little drunk

-- no, his voice is defiant, sadly defiant. He is singing at

the PATRONS rather than to them.

JAKE brings the BAND to a crescendo with a wave of his hand,

then silences it. The spotlight goes out and there is a

hearty round of applause.

JAKE receives the kisses, glad handshakes and congratulations

of the PATRONS as he works his way around the club.

JAKE's new friends love him. They are PARTY GIRLS, SPORTS

FIGURES, COLUMNISTS, MOBSTERS, B ACTORS, and OTHER

"CELEBRITIES."

JAKE poses for a still with TWO BUXOM YOUNG LOVELIES. ONE

GIRL giggles as he fondles her. After the flash goes off, the

GIRLS admire his "small, delicate" hands.

JAKE steps over to a table and greets J.R., a newspaper

columnist, and his COMPANIONS.

JAKE shakes his hand, then holds it up -- showing an empty

palm.

BRONSON is embarrassed. He doesn't think the joke is funny,

but he manages a smile. His WIFE gives a nervous laugh. JAKE

leans over and kisses her.

JAKE feigns a few jabs, and they all laugh. He walks off.

As JAKE leaves, J.R. whispers to his FRIEND:

JAKE steps over to a table where some of the "BOYS" are

sitting. RICKY is the Miami 1956 version of Salvy.

JAKE calls a WAITRESS over.

The WAITRESS says to a clearly underaged GIRL:

JAKE leans over and gives the young GIRL a long kiss on the

lips. She enthusiastically reciprocates.

They all laugh as JAKE moves on. The life of the party.

EXT. "JAKE LAMOTTA'S" - DAY

JAKE, hungover, his tux wrinkled, walks out of the club to

the adjacent parking lot.

VICKIE is sitting in her yellow Cadillac outside the Club.

The curbside window is halfway up. She calls to him:

JAKE, chagrined, steps over to the car.

JAKE tries to open the door. It's locked.

JAKE tries to reach in the window, but VICKIE hits the power

switch, closing it and catching his hand. She now has to yell

to him:

VICKIE turns her face and drives away.

JAKE grabs at the Cadillac, but it is bigger and stronger

than him.

JAKE is left alone in the parking lot. The car is gone.

INT. JAKE'S OFFICE - DAY (JAN. 9, 1957)

JAKE has an office above the lounge. Ever since VICKIE left,

it's also been his apartment.

The place is a mess. JAKE sends his laundry out when he runs

out of clean clothes. Dirty socks, shorts and shirts are

scattered randomly. Empty whiskey bottles on the desk, empty

beer cans in the wastebasket.

JAKE hunts for his clothes.

The SECOND DEPUTY shows JAKE a photo.

CLOSE UP of picture.

EXT. JAKE'S MIAMI HOUSE - DAY

JAKE, wearing a suit, walks up to the door and pushes the

bell.

VICKIE opens the door and looks at him over the chain.

JAKE tries to touch her face through the doorway crack, but

she steps back.

VICKIE thinks a moment, then opens the door and lets JAKE in.

INT. JAKE'S MIAMI HOUSE - DAY

JAKE walks directly past VICKIE into the living room. VICKIE

watches from a safe distance.

JAKE removes his jewel-studded championship belt from the

glass bookcase and carries it into the kitchen.

In the kitchen, he takes a hammer and screwdriver out of a

drawer, places the belt on the counter top, and starts

digging the jewels out of it.

VICKIE appears in the doorway.

JAKE, frustrated by his task, turns the belt over and hammers

at it. The jewels scatter across the counter top and floor.

JAKE collects the jewels and puts them in his pockets.

INT. JEWELRY SHOP - DAY

JAKE stands at the counter of a small jewelry store. The

JEWELER examines the stones.

JAKE seems to despair of the whole thing: the belt, the

attempt to raise 10 g's, the vice case, his life.

EXT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY

JAKE places a call from a booth outside the jewelry store.

INT. BARBIZON DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Same as Scene 1.

JAKE, 42 years old, continues to rehearse. He is seated

across from a mirror.

INT. DADE COUNTY STOCKADE - DAY

The CAMERA TRACKS down the lonely corridors of the Dade

County Prison. Empty faces stare out from behind the bars.

JAKE is led down a long corridor by TWO GUARDS. His hands and

legs are manacled and chained.

The GUARDS, redneck screws both, take special pleasure in

working JAKE over.

They take JAKE to the "Hole" -- solitary confinement.

ONE of the GUARDS unmanacles JAKE.

Both GUARDS push JAKE into the cell and slam the door.

INT. THE HOLE - DAY OR NIGHT

A thin slit provides the only light in JAKE's cell.

The rough cement walls are covered with obscure graffiti. The

8x8x8 room features only a cot and a toilet.

The room is mostly darkness. Sounds are more tangible here

than sights.

WE SEE JAKE's body as it passes through the slit of light.

JAKE crouches into the corner away from the light. As WE SEE

JAKE's face, the following MONTAGE images appear.

(There will be contrasting sound effects accompanying the

images: for example, the image of JAKE hitting VICKIE might

be accompanied by the sounds from a love scene between them.)

A) 1940s black and white pornography: partially clothed men

and women engaged in explicit sex acts.

B) Boxing magazines: fighters' beaten and bloody faces. A

body building ad: Charles Atlas raises his muscled biceps.

C) Li'l Abner comics; Daisy Mae's tits seem about to fall

free.

D) Reprise from earlier scene: Back in JAKE and IRMA's old

apartment, JOEY, using a towel as a glove, punches JAKE in

the face.

E) A 1934 "OLDER GIRL" sashays into the candy store in

flickering 8mm black and white footage. WE SEE ohter Bronx

PRETEEN GIRLS walking, smiling.

F) At Shorehaven pool, JAKE and JOEY, in bathing suits, are

sleeping in the sun next to each other. OTHER BATHERS are

around, also taking in the sun.

G) Reprise from earlier scene: As in D, JOEY hits JAKE in the

face again.

WE SEE again the image of JAKE's face as he sits in his cell.

The MONTAGE continues:

H) JANIRO's face at the weigh-in.

I) JAKE throws JANIRO a kiss at the weigh-in.

J) JAKE punches in JANIRO's face.

K) A naked GIRL stands in the doorway of a bedroom.

L) JAKE lies in bed with IRMA staring at the ceiling.

M) VICKIE's pretty young face DOUBLE EXPOSES with SUGAR RAY

ROBINSON's.

N) DR. PINTO injects novacaine into JAKE's fists.

O) Sitting in his corner of the ring, JAKE spits blood into a

pail...

P) Still in JAKE's corner: JOEY wipes off his brother's

bloody face.

Q) Still in JAKE's corner: There is an open cut over JAKE's

eye. JOEY, rushing against time, sucks the blood from the

wound as DR. PINTO begins to examine it.

R) Still in JAKE's corner: JOEY puts the mouthpiece in JAKE's

mouth. (SLOW MOTION)

S) JAKE wins over CERDAN. JOEY, overenthusiastic, hits JAKE

on the back of the head a little too hard. JAKE gives JOEY a

quick look, but JOEY just embraces him.

T) On a bed, a GIRL is going down on JOEY. The GIRL turns and

looks up at JAKE. It's LINDA, the waitress from his club.

JAKE stares.

U) JAKE's fist hits LINDA's face.

V) VICKIE playfully bends JAKE's hand back, pretending to

break it.

W) JAKE hits LINDA again. She cries.

X) Repeat image N: DR. PINTO injects novocaine into JAKE's

fists.

WE SEE again the image of JAKE's face as he sits in his cell.

The MONTAGE continues:

Y) VICKIE is in her underwear in a bedroom. A pair of black

arms come in and embrace her body.

Z) CLOSE UP of JAKE; he reacts to this. He's in the ring with

SUGAR RAY. He knocks SUGAR RAY out of the ring.

AA) VICKIE again. JAKE approaches her from behind, pulls her

head back by her hair, and slaps her.

BB) THE ANNOUNCER points to SUGAR RAY as the winner.

(Different fight.) CAMERA PANS to RAY, victorious, his arms

up.

CC) A bloodied JAKE comes over to SUGAR RAY and embraces him.

WE ARE BACK WITH JAKE in the cell. He slowly starts to bang

his head against the wall.

JAKE is now smashing the wall with all his strength --

vicious body punches.

JAKE breaks his knuckles; the pain and blood are unbearable.

JAKE collapses to the concrete floor. His hands are smashed.

He cries, then sobs.

Then silence.

We begin to hear: JAKE doing a monologue.

INT. METROPOLE - NIGHT (1958)

The Metropole is a club on 7th Avenue off Times Square.

JAKE LAMOTTA, 36 years old and wearing a hip Fifties suit,

continues his monologue.

The CROWD starts to shout: "Get the fuck off the stage!"

The CROWD continues to shout, as before, also shouting:

"Bring out the girls!"

JAKE gets off the stage as MISS EMMA 48's goes into her

dance. He goes over to the bar and gets a drink. SEVERAL

OLDER MEN in T-shirts - a disreputable looking lot - are at

the bar.

EXT. METROPOLE - NIGHT

The Club is closing. JAKE and EMMA, the stripper, come out

and walk by a delicatessen on their way to a parking lot.

JAKE sees his brother JOEY enter the delicatessen.

JAKE goes to the parking lot entrance as EMMA gets into a

cab.

EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

It's about twenty minutes later.

DOLLY INTO A MEDIUM SHOT of JAKE waiting by the parking lot.

He looks at the delicatessen.

JOEY finally comes out carrying a paper bag. Not noticing

JAKE, he walks right past him to his car which is parked near

the rear of the outdoor lot.

JAKE walks towards JOEY with his hand outstretched.

JOEY looks at JAKE. Silence. JOEY turns his back and starts

to get into his car.

JAKE runs over to JOEY and grabs his shoulder.

JOEY looks at JAKE like he's shit, throws JAKE's hand off his

shoulder, and starts to get into his car again.

JAKE stops JOEY from getting into his car. He puts his hand

on JOEY's shoulder again.

JOEY pulls away from JAKE's hand, and tries to put the paper

bag into the front seat of the car.

JOEY half pushes JAKE away, and begins to get into his car

again.

JAKE pulls JOEY by the arm.

JAKE pulls too hard, causing JOEY to drop the paper bag to

his feet. The containers of coffee and tea in the bag break

open and splatter JOEY's pants legs.

JOEY stares down at his pants, then up at JAKE. Suddenly, he

belts JAKE with a left and a right to the jaw. JAKE is taken

by surprise, and backs off to get his own hands up.

JOEY keeps pouring it on. JAKE drops his hands and takes it.

JOEY stops in mid-punch and stares at JAKE. He can't figure

it out.

JAKE nods and tries to smile, but starts to cry instead.

JOEY pauses, then finally throws a very weak punch to JAKE's

shoulder.

He leaves his hand there -- then, uncurls his fist -- and

finally puts his hand around JAKE's neck as tears start to

fill his eyes.

JOEY hugs JAKE close to him, crying.

They hug each other, both crying. They don't say anything.

EXT. BARBIZON PLAZA THEATER - NIGHT (1964)

The theater lights are flashing.

This may not be Broadway, but it's a long way from the

Metropole. The entrance to the Barbizon looks out on the

corner of 6th Avenue and Central Park South.

A stand-up billboard in front of the theater advertises "An

Evening with Jake LaMotta." The billboard also lists the

authors whose works will be performed: Paddy Chayevsky, Rod

Serling, Shakespeare, Bud Schulberg, Tennessee Williams.

INT. BARBIZON DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Same as Scenes One and Eighty-One.

JAKE is alone preparing to go onstage. He rehearses.

A shadow goes by the frame; it's a STAGEHAND.

The shadow exits.

The shadow pops in again.

The shadow exits.

JAKE pauses, then starts to shadow-box in his dressing room.

His breath comes in quick gasps. His feet pop up and down

like they were on canvas. His tiny fists jerk forward with

short bursts of light.

Still alive. Still a contender. A 42-year-old man fighting

for his shot.

The CAMERA DOLLIES into a FULL SHOT of his fists as they hit

the empty air -- in and out of the frame.

This quote appears: (Music in)

"Verily, verily I say unto thee,

The CAMERA goes into DARKNESS.

The END CREDITS roll up.
