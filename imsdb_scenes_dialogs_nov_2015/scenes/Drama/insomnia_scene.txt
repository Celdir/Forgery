FADE IN:

On credit sequence...

AN ARM

stretched out.  Long, alabaster white.  Beautiful.  A WASH

CLOTH enters frame.  Starts washing the arm with long, tender

strokes.

A TUMBLE OF HAIR

thick and auburn.  Being gently washed.

FINGERNAILS

being clipped with a shiny nail clipper.  Short.  Uniform.

Tidy.

EYEBROWS

brown with a touch of gold.  A BRUSH comes into view.

Brushes against the eyebrow hair, then back again.  Against.

Then back again.

PANTY-HOSE

pulled gingerly off a long leg.  Folded neatly.  The wash

cloth begins between the toes.  Warm, soapy water.

HAIR

now dry.  The HAND appears with a comb.  Pulls down through

the thick tresses.

It is only now that we see the hand is wearing a SURGICAL

GLOVE.

The gloved hand holds up the comb and pulls stray hairs from

it.  Places them in a big, clear, plastic bag.  In the bag we

see the panty-hose, a folded flower dress, the nail

clippings.

Goes back to combing.  Comes across a knot and yanks the comb

through.  The HEAD rolls over to us.  Her face is bruised,

her eyes blank.  She is lying on the floor.

Dead.

End of credit sequence.

INT. BUSH PLANE - THE KILBUCK MOUNTAINS, ALASKA - DAY

The loud THRUM of a bush plane.  We CLOSE ON a small, cloudy

window.  Through it we see an endless expanse of pine trees.

PULL BACK to reveal HAP ECKHART and WILL DORMER sitting side

by side.  Hap's at the window.  Greying moustache, a little

pudgy, wearing a brown suit.  Holding a folded over Seattle

Times.

Will's eyes remain on the file on his lap.

Will Dormer.  Tall, handsome, expensively tailored suit.

Snakeskin cowboy boots.  There's both a magnetism and a

distance to him.  An intense mixture.  Hap glances at him.

Will looks up.  We see the trace of a thick, ropy SCAR by his

Adam's apple.  There's tension between him and Hap, just

below the surface.  He taps the file.

ANGLE ON THE FILE

a stack of 8x10 PHOTOGRAPHS.  Of the dead girl.  Her eyes

puffed up from bruises.  The whites bloody.  Contusions along

her breasts and shoulders.

The PILOT's looking back at Will.  Wearing a leather red

baron hat.

Will nods.  The plane lurches.  The file falls to the floor

and the photographs scatter.  The pilot catches a glimpse of

them.  Looks at Will.

EXT. BUSH PLANE - CONTINUOUS

The small yellow plane veers left.  Clears a mountain top and

gives view to the spectacular Alaskan coastline.  The green

of the Bering sea, the blanket of pine trees, the jagged rock

of the beaches.  Enormous.

EXT. LANDING STRIP - OUTSIDE NIGHTMUTE - DAY

A SIGN swinging in the wind: Nightmute, Alaska.  Halibut

Fishing Capital of the World!

PULL BACK to reveal it hanging from the eave of a small,

corrugated building.  The "airport."  Nothing else for miles

around.

A mud-splattered Jeep Cherokee pulls up next to it.  Brakes

SCREECHING.  A YOUNG WOMAN hops out.  About 23.  Petite with

short, brown hair.

Peers up at the sky.  Brightens at the sight of the BUSH

PLANE coming in for landing.  Smooths down her down vest.

Making sure the GOLD SHIELD on her belt's visible.  Nervous.

Excited.

ELLIE BURR turns.  Shields her eyes from the sun.  An OLD MAN

hosing down the side of the building.

Ellie puffs up.

The old man screws up his face, confused.

A CAT jumps down off the roof.  Angstrom sprays it.

Ellie, used to not being taken seriously.  Turns back to THE

ROAR of the bush plane as it taxis down the strip.  Coming to

a stop.  She hurries over as the door swings open and...

WILL DORMER steps down.  Slipping on his sunglasses.

Scanning the nothingness around him.  Spots the swinging

sign.

Hap, right behind him.  Rubs his neck.

They look down.  Ellie reaches up and takes Will's bag.  Then

his hand.  Shakes it vigorously.

Will motions to Hap.

She leads them away from the plane.  Takes Will's briefcase.

Opens the back of the Jeep.  Puts the bags inside.

The Pilot walks by.  Taps her on the shoulder.

She looks back at Will.  Can't help but focus in on his scar.

Touches her own smooth neck.  In awe.

Will smiles, taken aback by this girl's exuberance.

She throws a quick glance at Angstrom.  Out of ear-shot.

EXT. NIGHTMUTE POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY

The Cherokee parked next to a police car outside a plain, one-

storey building.  The Nightmute Police Department.  A totem

pole stands out front.

INT. CHIEF CHARLES NYBACK'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Nightmute Police Chief CHARLES NYBACK gets up from behind his

desk with a big smile.  Ruddy, red hair sprinkled with grey,

Nyback wears a faded army sweater over his uniform.

Limps from behind his desk and gives Will a shake and a slap

on the back.

Nyback shakes Hap's hand.  A reunion.

Looks at Will.  Down at his boots.

Will.  Looks at Nyback's gut.

They LAUGH.  Eyes twinkling.

He starts back over to his desk.  Notices Ellie still

standing by the door.  Points to Will.

Ellie straightens.  Smiles.  Looks over at Will.

Ellie, realises they want to be alone.

Backs out.  Quietly closing the door behind her.  Will

unbuttons his jacket.  Takes a seat.

Will surveys the fishing poles leaning against the gun rack.

Hap picks up a cheap trophy.  Reads the base.

Nyback nods to Hap's Seattle Times.  The headline:  "Deeper

Investigation into Special Branch"...

Will and Hap share a look.  No more joking.  Hap folds over

the paper.

Nyback winces.

Nyback pulls a stack of messages from his desk.

Hap tosses a glance over at Will.

Nyback turns and ceremoniously drops the messages into the

trash.

A cloud passes over his face.

Holds up a file.  The name written on the lip:  KAY CONNELL.

INT. HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER

Nyback leads Will and Hap down a hallway.  Crooked plaques

and black-and-white pictures line the walls.

They turn a corner and stop at a door.  Will glances up:

MOOSE ANTLERS hanging over it.

Nyback opens the door onto...

INT. BULLPEN - NIGHTMUTE PD - CONTINUOUS

...the bullpen of Nightmute PD.  Wooden desks, a couple

computers, a jumbled corkboard, an impressive gun cabinet.  A

RADIO's playing.

Three MEN look over.  A young uniformed cop and two guys with

heavy facial hair, Timberland boots, and flannel shirts.  One

of them's part Inuit.  Ellie sits in the back.  Reaches over

to turn off the radio.

Will and Hap stand in the doorway.  Sticking out like sore

thumbs in their suits.  Nyback jerks his thumb towards them.

The Inuit, FRED DUGGAR, snorts.  Takes his feet of the desk.

Will puts out his hand.

Fred tugs at his dark handlebar moustache.  Stands.

EXT. NIGHTMUTE POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY

Fred steps out of the station, pulls on a baseball cap.

He heads off across the parking lot.  Will and Hap exchange a

glance.

They turn.  Ellie's come up behind them.  Looks over at the

hunched figure to Fred.

Fred stops up ahead.  Sees her.  Annoyed.

INT. NIGHTMUTE MORGUE - LATER

CLOSE ON a faucet.  A bead of water, quivering at the mouth.

Falls with a BLIP!

PULL BACK to reveal Will, Hap, and the COUNTY CORONER

standing by a stainless steel table.  The naked body of KAY

CONNELL is laid out before them.  Fred hangs back.

The coroner tugs at her surgical gloves.  She's in her late

seventies.

Will points to the bruises on the body's shoulders and

breasts.

The coroner starts to cover the body with a sheet.

Will stays her hand.

He pulls the sheet back down.  Studying the body of Kay

Connell.  Starts walking slowly around the table.  In his

element.  The faucet drips.  Drips.  Drips.

He bends down to smell her hair.

Takes a handful and lets it fall from his fingers.

Continues around the table.  Picks up one of her hands.

Examines her fingers, her nails.

Continues down around her feet.  Checks between her first and

second toes.

Will stands there.  Looking down at the body.  Slim.  Young.

Beautiful.  Skin like marble.

Will looks up and locks eyes with his partner.

INT. PIONEER LODGE - NIGHTMUTE - NIGHT

Will and Hap enter the lobby of the Pioneer Lodge.  Big stone

fireplace and heavy ceiling beams.  MOOSE ANTLERS mounted

above reception.  They put their bags down by the desk.  Look

around.

They turn.  RACHEL CLEMENT stands in a doorway behind the

desk.  Dunking a teabag into a mug.  Long dark hair and

intelligent eyes.

Hap smiles at her.  Will checks his watch.

Rachel looks at him.  Goes to a small file box on the desk.

He glances out the window.  It's as bright as day.

She hands them two cards.

INT. WILL'S ROOM - NIGHT

Will's taken off his jacket and is unpacking.  The room is

sparse and creaky.  Bed dips in the middle.  He hangs a

jacket in the armoire then returns to his suitcase.  Pulls

out his SMITH AND WESSON 45.

Lays it on the bedside table.  Takes out a shoulder holster.

A back holster.  A handful of shells.  Lays them on the

table.  Then a small SMITH AND WESSON 39/13 9MM.  Checks the

magazine.

There's a KNOCK on the adjoining door.

Will SLAPS the magazine back.

Hap opens the door.  A glimpse into his room: family PICTURES

on his bedside table - a WOMAN and three teenage GIRLS.

He walks over to the big window.  It overlooks the harbor.

Big, snow-capped mountains in the distance.  One lone TUGBOAT

in the harbor towing a freighter.

Will reaches into his suitcase.  Pulls out a shirt.

Will throws him a look.

Will goes back to his suitcase.  Hap follows.  A thin film of

sweat on his upper lip.

Will flares up.  Struck a nerve.  Turns to his partner.

He grabs a hanger.

He takes out a handkerchief.  Wipes his brow.

Will turns on his partner, eyes burning.

The partners, lock eyes.  Years of working together.  A

thousand things unsaid.  Hap reaches for the door.

INT. WILL'S ROOM - NIGHT

Will's asleep.  Kay Connell's folder open on his chest.  It's

dark in his room, quiet.  Suddenly the shade on his window

quivers and SNAPS up, flooding the room with light.

Will's eyes pop open.  He rolls over to look at the clock:

3:15.  Squinting, he gets up and walks over to the window.

We can see the rest of his scar.  Runs down deep across his

sternum.

He yanks the shade back down.  It bucks, then settles.

Satisfied, Will returns to bed.  Plumps the pillow, pulls the

blanket up around him.  Closes his eyes.

The shade lurches halfway.  Then SNAPS back up.  Light pours

in.  Will's eyes open.

EXT. STREET - NIGHTMUTE - DAY

Will jogs along in a Sonics sweatshirt, a ring of sweat

around his collar.  He looks out over the harbor.  Fishing

boats coming in with their early morning haul.  More halibut.

He checks his watch.  Slows to a walk.  Looks up and sees...

Ellie Burr standing on the front steps of the Pioneer Lodge.

Smiles.  Holds up some car keys.

INT./EXT. JEEP CHEROKEE - DAY

Ellie driving.  A hula-girl, swinging from the rear-view

mirror.  Will in the passenger seat.  Wearing a crisp suit.

Ellie hands him a take-out bag.

Will takes the bag.  Looks inside.  Yikes.

He puts the bag on the dash.  Looks out the window.

Nightmute's main street.  A line of shops.  Undistinguished

Town Hall.  Elementary school up on a hill.  Sign out front:

Sign-ups for Midnight Little League!

She shifts down.  Takes a steep turn.

They pass a MAN walking along the road.  Gnarled walking

stick.  Ellie calls out the window.

JOE waves.  They pass.

Will looks over at her.  Smiles.

He looks over.  Ellie's listening intently.

Ellie, searching her pockets for something to write with...

Stops.  Looks over.  Realises Will's teasing her.

EXT. CONNELL HOUSE - DAY

A small ranch house.  Aluminum siding.  FLOWERS piled up by

the front door.  TEDDY BEARS.  RIBBONS.  Left by well-wishers.

INT. HALLWAY - CONNELL HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

MRS. CONNELL, a big woman with a thick grey braid down her

back, opens the door to her daughter's room.  Looks at Will.

Will heads into the room.  Hap follows.  A palpable

uneasiness between them.  Fred and Ellie stand in the

doorway.  Mrs. Connell turns to go.

INT. KAY CONNELL'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

A small bedroom.  Pink shag carpeting and clouds painted on

the ceiling.  Pictures cut from magazines pasted on the

walls.  A stack of tapes and a boom box in the corner.

Will stands in the middle of the room.  Taking it in.

Fred throws Ellie a look.  "Kids?"  She's practically a kid

herself.  Will opens the top drawer of the bureau.  Roots

beneath the panties.

On top of the bureau, a stack of photos.  A couple torn up.

Kay Connell and a GIRL with white-blonde hair.  Laughing.

Hap picks up a bear on Kay's bed.  A bell JINGLES when he

shakes it.  Will crosses to a closet in the corner.

Will pulls a dress out of the closet.  Small, black, elegant.

The tag's been cut out.  He pulls out another, then another.

Feels the fabric.

Fred and Ellie exchange a look.

Will looks around.  Cheap wallpaper, torn window screens.

Will reaches over to a heart-shaped box on the bedside table.

Pulls out a pretty gold necklace.  Holds it up.

He hands the dresses to Ellie.  Heads out of the room.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

CLOSE ON a hand squeezing a shoulder.  Hard.

The shoulder jerks away.  PULL BACK to reveal RANDY STETZ

sitting at a wooden table in an interrogation room.  Longish

blond hair, wearing a Metallica t-shirt, trying like hell to

grow a moustache.

He takes out a cigarette.  It's bent.  He lights it.  Hap

sits opposite.

Randy throws him a look.

Will goes over to a coffee machine.  Pours a cup.

Randy flicks his ash.  Shrugs.

Will turns with his coffee.

Randy glares.

Will suddenly hurls his coffee cup and grabs Randy up by the

collar.  Nose to nose.

Randy's lip curls.  Red-faced.

Disgusted, Will shoves Randy back into his seat.

INT. HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER

Will walking out of the interrogation room.  Ellie joins him.

Will smooths back his hair.  Checks his tie.

He reaches into his pocket and pulls out the gold necklace

from Kay's room.  Hands it to her.

Will stops.  Ellie stops.  Will puts a hand on her shoulder.

Ellie smiles, teasing.

Will, has to smile.  She's quick.  Looks down the hall.  A

bearded GUY on crutches.  Ellie follows his gaze.

Will heads over to him.  Ellie watches his neck.  Her hand

closing over the necklace.

INT. RESTAURANT - PIONEER LODGE - NIGHT

The Pioneer Lodge restaurant.  Small, dark wood, a RADIO

playing something between Bluegrass and Folk.  Some rough-

looking GUYS at the bar.  Throwing looks over at...

Will and Hap, sitting at a table.  Studying faded menus.

He puts down his menu.  Reaches for his drink.

Will drains his drink.  Locks eyes with a big GUY over at the

bar.  Beer froth on his moustache.

Will looks back at his partner.  Hap's fidgeting with the end

of his tie.

A cold flash down Will's spine.

Hap avoids his eyes.

The men look up, interrupted.  Rachel is standing by the

table with a pad.  Hap tries to recover with a big smile.

Will stands abruptly.  Eyes on Hap.  Trying not to explode.

Just then, his cell phone RINGS.

INT. BULLPEN - NIGHTMUTE PD - NIGHT

Will bursts into the bullpen.  Hap behind.

Ellie, Fred, and a couple other GUYS huddled around a desk.

Will and Hap head over to them.  One of the younger guys,

FARRELL, intimidated by Will's presence.  Tucks his shirt

into his dirty jeans.

They part to reveal a BLUE KNAPSACK laying on the desk.  Mud

spots all over it.  An embroidered daisy.  Will examines it.

Ellie shakes her head, unfortunately not.  Will reaches into

the bag.  Pulls out two text books.

He shoves the books towards one of the guys.

He continues through the bag.  Pulls out a little plastic bag

with "Hello Kittys" all over it.  Dumps out the contents.

Looks up at Fred.

Fred looks at him.  Not happy with make-up duty.  Will pulls

out a hair brush.  Hands it to Ellie.

Next, a couple worn paperbacks.

He looks up at the group.

Farrell straightens.

Will tosses them to him.

Down to the bottom of the bag.  A Ziploc with a half-eaten

sandwich and an apple core.  Will hands them to Ellie.

Upends the knapsack.  Scraps, paper clips, gum wrappers.

Fred reaches for the knapsack.

Will takes it, walks slowly over to the window.  Thinking.

Twists the knapsack in his hands and looks out at the

TOTEM POLE standing tall outside.  A black RAVEN alights on

top of it.  Pecks at the air.  Turns.  Seems to look right at

Will.

Will turns to them.

Fred tightens his jaw.

Will ignores the question.  Walks back towards them.

He hands the bag to Farrell.

Will pulls out a handkerchief.  Wipes the mud off his hands.

Taking his time.  Finally turns to Fred.

EXT. ROCKY BEACH - OUTSIDE NIGHTMUTE - MORNING

POV through BINOCULARS

A WOODEN CABIN comes into focus.  Right by the water.  Hasn't

been used in years.  Weathered, slate roof.  Algae growing up

the sides.

WILL lowers his binoculars.  He's standing on the black rocky

beach.  It's damp, slick, and cold.  A fog's rolling in.

Hap and Farrell are sitting behind a cluster of rocks.  A

couple paper bags and a megaphone.  They're comparing guns.

Hap reaches into his holster.  Pulls out a...

Fred Duggar's standing on the other side of them.  He's got a

pair of binoculars, too.  They're staking out the cabin.

Been there a while.

Ellie appears with a thermos.  Crouching down.  Fred turns,

annoyed.

Fred shoots Will a look.  Down at his cowboy boots.  Will

gives him a smile.

Fred goes back to scanning, pissed.

Hap and Farrell chuckle.  Hap unscrews the thermos.  A cloud

of steam.

Will looks down at his partner.  Holding out the thermos like

a weird kind of truce.  Will turns away, rejecting it.  A

swath of thick fog unfolds over the black rocks as...

Fred tenses.

Hap and Farrell scramble to their feet.  Will whips up his

binoculars.

POV THROUGH WILL'S BINOCULARS - a FIGURE making its way to

the cabin.  Furtive.

Will lowers the binoculars.  Snaps his fingers at the men.

Fred, Farrell and Hap.  Start spreading out.  Ellie steps

up.  Will looks back at her.  Too dangerous.

Will puts up his hand.  She stops short.  He plunges ahead.

Hap.  Will.  Farrell.  Fred.  Fanning out.  Silent.  Keeping

eye-contact.  Will points to Farrell.  Wants the megaphone.

Farrell, balancing on a rock, holds it out.  Accidentally

keys it.  The feedback SQUAWKS.  Fuck.

POV THROUGH WILL'S BINOCULARS - the FIGURE, looking around,

running towards the cabin.  Leaping from rock to rock.

WILL reaches for his Smith and Wesson.

The men jump into action.  Race down towards the cabin.

Fred and Farrell, nimble over the wet rocks.  Will and Hap,

harder going.  Grab onto jagged edges, slip down small

crevices.  Rocks sticking out every which way.  The fog,

thick and white...

THE FIGURE disappears into the cabin.

FRED AND FARRELL leap up onto a tall boulder and jump down.

Run over to the door of the cabin, guns at the ready...

WILL rounds the boulder, Hap panting behind him.  Joins Fred

and Farrell at the door.

Will levels his Smith and Wesson at the door, and with a nod

to Fred as he KICKS it in...

INT. FISHING CABIN - CONTINUOUS

...the door CRACKS and swings in.  The men rush inside.

They look around:  Nothing.  A few old nets, a wooden table

rotted through.  No knapsack.

In the corner, a TRAP DOOR, left open.  Will races over.

Looks down into the darkness.

Turns and points to Farrell.

The men nod.

They rush out the door and split directions.  Will crouches

down by the trap door and...

INT. TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

...drops down into a dark, dank TUNNEL.  Water dripping.

FOOTFALLS echoing.  Will cocks his head.  Left or right?

Starts sprinting down towards the lighter end of the tunnel,

his own footsteps bouncing against the tunnel walls.  He

rounds a curve.  Sound recedes...

EXT. TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

...He exits the tunnel onto the rocky beach.  Stops short.

FOG

has enveloped everything - obscuring all vision, dulling all

sound.  Like a strange dream.  Eerie.

Will blinks against the thick whiteness.  Strains to hear any

sound, anything.  There's only the distant LAPPING of the

water.

He tightens his grip on his gun and plunges into the fog.

Quick, careful steps.  Stumbles over a rock.  Waves his gun

in defense.  Eyes wide open like a blind man...

SUDDENLY

a GUNSHOT.  Off to the right.  Will whips his head around.

EXT. UP ON THE BEACH - CONTINUOUS

Ellie, alone, jumps at the sound.  Reaches for her weapon...

EXT. DOWN THE BEACH - CONTINUOUS

Will heads towards the sound.  Reaching out for approaching

rocks.  Scrambles over a small bank and finds...

FARRELL rolled up into a fetal position on the ground.

Clutching his thigh.  Blood seeping through his fingers.  He

looks up.

Farrell can't answer that.

Farrell lifts his bloody hand.  Points off towards the water.

Will disappears back into the fog, leaving Farrell behind.

Clambers back down towards the water, pausing every few

seconds to listen, to adjust.  Heart POUNDING.  Blood

pumping.  Like an animal tracking its prey.  Leaps up onto a

plateau of rocks when...

SUDDENLY

a DARK FIGURE

flashes past him.  The killer!  Inches away.  Will wheels

around...

CRACK!  Squeezes off a shot.  Misses!  Can't believe it.

Goes for another... Nothing!  Jammed!  The figure,

disappearing.  Will tosses his Smith and Wesson, reaches

behind his back and whips out his SMITH 39/13...

EXT. UP ON THE BEACH - CONTINUOUS

Ellie, weapon drawn, making her way down the rocks.  A HAND

suddenly grabs her arm.

Fred emerges from the fog.

CRACK! as another shot rips through the air.  Fred and Ellie

freeze.

EXT. DOWN BY THE WATER - MINUTES LATER

Fred and Ellie, skittering down the rocks.  Getting closer to

the water.  Hear a voice ring out...

The fog starts to dissipate.  They reach the water to see...

WILL DORMER

kneeling beside the body of his partner.  Lying in the water.

Shot in the stomach.  Blood dribbling from his mouth.  Will

grabs him up by the collar.

Starts shaking the limp body.  Teeth clenched.

Hap's head, rolls back.  Mouth agape.  Face white...

Will, rips off his tie.  Presses it to the gaping wound...

trying to stop the bleeding...warm blood, pumping into the

water...

Ellie watches.  Horrified.  Fred races over to the body.

Feels for Hap's pulse.

Will, shaking Hap again.  Jaw set.  Eyes intense.  Veins

popping up along his temples.  Fred catches his shoulder.

Will looks up at Fred.  His face contorts.

Suddenly leaps to his feet.  Grabs a rock and hurls it

savagely into the thick fog.

INT. CHIEF CHARLES NYBACK'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Chief Nyback sits in his chair.  Fingers interlaced.  A

somber expression on his face.

Will sits opposite him.  Wet, dishevelled, dirty.  Hap's

blood smeared all over his shirt.  Staring off into space.

Will, hesitates.

He blinks.  Looks down.  Swallows.

Nyback sighs, shakes his head.  Reaches down to his bottom

drawer and pulls out a bottle of bourbon and a glass.

He goes to unscrew the bottle, but Will shakes his head.

Stands.  Paces.  Rakes his hand through his hair.

Turns suddenly and swipes his arm across Nyback's desk.

Everything CRASHES to the floor.

Nyback looks up at him.  Calm.

Will clenches his fists.

Nyback gets up.  Limps over to his old friend.

Just then there's a soft KNOCK on the door.  The men look

over.  Ellie sticks her head in.  Speaks in a tone that

belies that a man has recently died.

Will turns his back to her.  Nyback heads over.

Ellie flicks a look at the pile on the floor.  At Will's

back.

Ellie looks at him.  Confused.  Lowers her voice.

Nyback puts a hand on her shoulder.

Ellie's shoulders droop.  Thought she was playing with the

big boys.  Just then Will turns abruptly and grabs his coat.

Nyback catches his arm.

Will looks at him.  Know's he's right.

EXT. ROAD - NIGHTMUTE - DAY

CLOSE ON a SQUEALING tire, ripping around a curve...

INT./EXT. SILVER JEEP CHEROKEE - CONTINUOUS

Will driving.  Speeding.  Scenery whipping past the window.

His hands, tight around the steering wheel.  The hula-girl,

dancing beneath the rear view mirror, a smile plastered to

her face.

He grows suddenly pale.  Pulls the Cherokee off to the side.

EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

Will jumps out of the Cherokee, leaving the door open.  Runs

down an ALLEY behind a row of shops.

INT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

A couple industrial trash bins.  Will leans his hand against

the wall and vomits.  Hovers for a moment, saliva dripping

from his mouth.  Braces himself.  Heaves again.  Hears a

BUZZING behind him.  Turns.

A DEAD DOG lying next to a dumpster.  FLIES buzzing around

its head.  Teeth bared.  Eyes wide open.

Like it's watching him.

INT. PIONEER LODGE - LATER

Will walks up to reception.  No one there.  Just wants his

key.  Rings the bell.  In the back room, he hears a RADIO.

It clicks off abruptly.  Rachel appears in the doorway.

Takes in the blood on Will's shirt.

Will looks at her.  She walks over to the desk.

She reaches for his key.

Will takes his key.

He smiles faintly, turns to go.  Just then the phone RINGS.

Will stops.  Turns.  Rachel holds up the phone.  Covering the

mouthpiece.

Will's stomach drops.  That's the last phone call in the

world he wants to take.  Rachel reads his face.

Will shakes his head.  Steps back and takes the phone.

Clears his throat.

PAUSE.  A bemused VOICE on the other end.

Will.  Not giving this asshole an inch.  Rachel, trying not

to listen.

Will, squeezing the phone cord with his bloody fist.

Will turns from Rachel.  Eyes burning.  Voice steady.

SLAM!  He hangs up the phone.  Runs his hand through his

hair.  Turns back to Rachel.

EXT. ROCKY BEACH - OUTSIDE NIGHTMUTE - MORNING

Fog everywhere.  Dense.  White.  Suffocating.

We're running through it.  Clambering over rocks.  Hearing

the sound of our own BREATHING.  Our own HEARTBEAT.

Adrenaline pumping.  An animal tracking its prey...

SUDDENLY a DARK FIGURE

flashes past.  Just inches away.  Playing with us.  Taunting

us.  We whip round with our weapon and...

INT. WILL'S ROOM - LATE NIGHT

BANG!  Will bolts upright in bed.  A film of sweat over his

body.  Breathing hard.  The sound that woke him: the window

shade FLAPPING open.  LIGHT floods the room.

Will gets up.  Goes over to the shade and pulls it down.  It

lurches up halfway.  He tugs it down again.  It slaps all the

way open.  Will yanks it down so hard it rips off the window.

He gets tangled in it.

Pulls it off and flings it in the corner.

INT. WILL'S ROOM - 4:22 A.M.

The digital clock flips to a new minute:  4:23.  Will,

pacing.  Scratching at his stubble.  Unable to sleep.  Keeps

stepping on a SQUEAKY floorboard.

Slows near the ADJOINING DOOR that leads into Hap's room.

Hovers.  Lightly pushes the door open.  Sees...

THE PICTURES on the bedside table.  A WOMAN and three teenage

GIRLS.  Hap's family.

INT. BATHROOM - 5:18 A.M.

Water gushing out of the faucet.  Will's WATCH sitting on the

sink's edge.  5:18.

Will reaches up into the open medicine cabinet for a bottle

of aspirin.  Shakes out a couple.  Cups his hand under the

water and knocks the pills back.

Closes the medicine cabinet and CRIES out...

HAP'S REFLECTION

looming behind him.

Will whirls around...

...nothing.  No one's there.

EXT. MAINSTREET - NIGHTMUTE - MORNING

CLOSE ON running shoes, POUNDING the tarmac.  PULL BACK to

reveal Will running down Nightmute's main street.  Eyes

bloodshot.

A COUPLE NATIVE ALASKANS walking into a hardware store.  Stop

talking and glance over at him.

A YOUNG MOTHER in her husband's work shirt.  Lifts her small

KIDS into the cab of a 4x4.  Watches him pass.

AN OLDER MAN fixing the broken "E" on his store front.  Turns

at the sound of Will's footfall.

Everyone edgy.  Cautious.  A murderer amongst them.

Will continues on.  Looking straight ahead.  Wipes the sweat

from his neck.  Slows to a stop just outside the...

LOCAL CONVENIENCE STORE

A blown-up picture of KAY CONNELL in the window.  Below, a

painted sign:  We miss you, Kay.

A stack of newspapers by the front door.  The "Nightmute

Ledger."  The headline:  Seattle Cop Killed by Suspect.

Will picks one up.  Stares down at it.  Rain starts to dot

the paper.

INT. BULLPEN - NIGHTMUTE PD - CONTINUOUS

Rain hammering against the windows.  Chief Nyback addresses

the bullpen.  Everyone's there except Farrell.

Will stands nearby, watching the rain hit the windows.  His

suit pants are slightly wrinkled.  Nyback nods towards Fred.

Fred, stroking his moustache, nods.  Nyback turns to Will.

Will looks up.  Everyone's eyes turn to him.  He shakes his

head.

Feet shuffling.  Chairs scraping the floor as people get up.

A sense of determination in the air.  Will grabs his coat.

He turns.  Ellie is beside him, holding a map.

She holds out the map.  It's of the small stretch of

coastline.  Red circles marking various points.

Will looks down at her.  Takes the map.  Turns it around.

He looks down at the map.  Ellie watching his face.

Will points to a spot.  Cutting her off.

Hands her back the map.  Smiles.  Just then Fred walks up.

He pulls on his coat and heads for the door.  Fred watches

him leave.  Sticks a toothpick in his mouth.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - ST. FRANCIS HOSPITAL - DAY

CLOSE ON the cover of one of the paperbacks, Otherwise

Engaged by Walter Byrd.

PULL BACK to reveal Farrell lying in a hospital bed in

striped pajamas, reading it.  A tear runs down his cheek as

he turns the page.

A SNICKERS BAR is tossed onto his lap.  He looks up.  Face

brightens.

He pulls up a chair.  Nods to the paperback.

Farrell bites into the candy bar.

He stops chewing.  Realises the association.  Swallows

uncomfortably.

Farrell takes another bite of the Snickers.  Like a little

boy.  Furrows his brow, trying to remember.

Will sighs, rubs his eyes.

Just then a NURSE comes in with a Dixie cup.  Pretty,

freckled face.  Not much older than Kay Connell.

Farrell smiles at her, winks at Will.

Lonnie gives him the cup.

Will looks up.  Farrell pops the rest of the Snickers in his

mouth.

INT. HALLWAY - HOSPITAL - LATER

Will walks down the hallway.  Light pouring in from a set of

high windows.  He looks tired.  Set-upon.

POV of SOMEONE

WATCHING HIM.  From a doorway.  Not close, not far.  A HAND

comes into view.  Small.  Bruised knuckles.  Holds on to the

door jamb.  Watches as...

Will suddenly stops.  Skin prickling at the back of his neck.

Turns and looks around.

A MAN in a wheelchair.

A LITTLE GIRL tugging at her hospital gown.

A couple of NURSES laughing at check-in.

An empty doorway.

Nothing.

EXT. ROCKY BEACH - OUTSIDE NIGHTMUTE - MORNING

Back at the beach.  We see nothing but fog.  A VOICE comes

through.

Ellie emerges from the fog.  Carrying the map and talking

into a small tape recorder.  She's climbing over the rocks,

wearing a windbreaker a couple sizes too big.

A UNIFORMED OFFICER follows, carrying a camera.  She turns to

him.

She climbs over the same bank Will Dormer climbed two

evenings before.  Finds...

ANOTHER UNIFORMED OFFICER, hanging out and smoking.

He looks up.  Pimples on his chin.

Francis looks up at her.  Flicks his cigarette away and gets

down amongst the rocks.  Holds his thigh like he was shot.

CLICK!  Kepp takes the picture.

EXT. DOWN BY THE WATER - MINUTES LATER

Ellie sloshes through the water.  Ankles getting cold.

Cheeks pink.  But it doesn't matter.  She's investigating.

She stops.  Looks at the map.  At the spot Will pointed out.

A VOICE calls back.  Someone pretending to be Hap.

Ellie furrows her brow.  Just then...

FRANCIS appears.  Slips on a rock but catches his fall.

EXT. ROAD NEAR BEACH - DAY

CLOSE ON a row of FEET.  Mostly boots.  Some more beat-up

than others.  Inching forward along a road.

PULL BACK to reveal a long line of PEOPLE stretched out

across the road about a mile up the beach.  Some old, some

young.  Linking arms and moving forward.  Looking down.  The

SEARCH PARTY.

Will, walking up and down behind the line.  Talking through a

megaphone.

Will turns.  A couple burly GUYS with some BLOODHOUNDS.

Will points over to the woods on the other side of the road.

Nods to Fred who's standing nearby.  He hands the guys two

radios.

Just then two young OFFICERS pull up in a squad car.  Young

and apple-cheeked.  The first one holding a piece of paper.

Hands the list to Will.  He glances it.

The Officers nod, put the car in reverse.  Fred saunters

over.  Nods towards the searchers.

Will shakes his head.

Fred shrugs, skeptical.  Just then, his cell phone BLEATS.

He reaches for it.

Will looks back at the search team.  Slow.  Meticulous.

A local WOMAN.  At the end of the line.  Glances over her

shoulder.  Looks at Will.  Smiles.  You'll help us catch him.

Will turns back to him.

Fred crosses his arms.  Sarcastic.

EXT. PIONEER LODGE - NIGHTMUTE - NIGHT

Thunder RUMBLING.

INT. PIONEER LODGE - NIGHTMUTE - NIGHT

Rachel winding an old grandfather clock with a key.  Looks

about a hundred years old.

Will enters the lobby.  Soaked through.  Carrying an armload

of wet files.  Rachel turns, sees him.  Reaches over to an

umbrella stand.  Hands him an umbrella.

Will takes it.  Preoccupied.

He starts up the stairs.  Notices Rachel straining to return

the key to the top of the clock.  Backtracks to help her.

She gets it without his help.

Rachel looks at him.  Can't figure this guy out.  Remembers

something.

A TINGLE skips down Will's spine.  He looks at her.

Rachel thinks for a second.  Leaning against the clock.

Will nods, rubs his forehead.  Suddenly has a pounding

headache.  Turns for the stairs.  Hesitates.

INT. WILL'S ROOM - NIGHT

CLOSE ON a nail.  One THWACK of a hammer and it bites into

the wall.  PULL BACK to reveal Will nailing the corner of a

blanket to one side of the window.  An ad hoc curtain.

He finishes that side.  Starts to stretch the blanket across

the window.  Hesitates.  Looks outside.  To the left.  To the

right.  To see if anybody's out there.  If anybody's

watching.  Sees instead...

A LONE TUGBOAT chugging across the harbor.  Pulling a huge

freighter.  Will squeezes his eyes shut.  Opens them again.

Pulls the blanket fully across the window.

INT. WILL'S ROOM - 1:05 A.M.

The FILES spread across the floor.  Their edges buckled from

the rain.  Dozens of pictures of Kay Connell.  School

records.  Private letters.  Health files.  Coroner's report.

Will.  Pacing.  Back and forth.  Thinking.  Over that same

SQUEAKY floorboard.  The clock reads: 1:05.

INT. WILL'S ROOM - 2:20 A.M.

Will lying in bed.  On top of the blanket.  Wide awake.

Staring at the ADJOINING DOOR.  Into Hap's room.

EXT. PIONEER LODGE - NIGHTMUTE - LATE NIGHT

Will, in a sweatshirt and coat, heads down the front steps of

the Pioneer Lodge.  Jams his hands in his pockets.  The walk

of an insomniac.

EXT. MAINSTREET - NIGHTMUTE - LATE NIGHT

Will walking down main street.  In the middle of the road.

The dead of night.  No cars.  The sky a blinding white.

Hears some rowdy NOISE coming from a corner bar, beer lights

flickering.  A WOMAN rides by on a bicycle.  Birds SINGING.

Not day.  Not night.  Stuck somewhere in between.  Like a

dream.

Turns down a side street.  Passing more stores.  Guns and

Ammo.  Patty's Hair and Nails.  General Store.  Comes upon

THE ALLEY

where he vomited the day before.  Stops.  Sees the DEAD DOG,

still down at the end.  Half obscured by the dumpster.

Will wavers, pale.  Suddenly...

A HOMELESS MAN emerges from the shadows.  Big.  Wild-eyed.

Awakened from his sleep.  Will, quickly backtracks to the

sidewalk.  Spooked.

JUST THEN the CRACK! of bat hitting ball.  He turns.  In the

distance.  Nightmute Elementary School.

EXT. NIGHTMUTE ELEMENTARY - LATE NIGHT

A Little League game in full swing.  The uniforms, a little

faded.  The diamond, a little unkempt.  A smattering of

SPECTATORS.  Mostly dads with six-packs.

Will wanders over to the fence.  Spots Ellie sitting alone on

the bottom bleacher.

POV OF SOMEONE

WATCHING HIM.  From afar.  The SOUNDS of the game, delayed a

few seconds.  Watches as Will crosses to the bleachers...

...and sits down next to Ellie.  She turns, surprised.

Will glances out at the game.

She sips on a take-out coke.  Looks back at the game.  A

plump, redheaded GIRL comes up to bat.  Blows a bubble.

Will looks over just in time to see the girl swing and miss

by a mile.  Ellie cups her hands around her mouth.

Libby takes another swing.  Connects with the ball.  Drops

the bat and runs to first.  Ellie gives a sharp WHISTLE.

Ellie, sits up...

Will leans back.  Stretching his legs.  Remembering.

Suddenly, he stops talking.  Slowly sits up.  Sensing

something.  Ellie, noticing the shift.

The row of DADS behind them.  Jump up and start CHEERING.

POV OF THE PERSON

WATCHING WILL.  Sees him sit up.  Look around.  That same

prickle at the back of his neck.  A KID slides home just as...

...Will stands.  Trying to shake the feeling.

He turns to go, scanning the area.  Ellie calls after him.

EXT. NIGHTMUTE MORGUE - EARLY MORNING

The Nightmute morgue.  Next morning.  A SQUAD CAR pulls up.

Francis gets out, whistling.  Starts for the morgue's

entrance.

INT./EXT. JEEP CHEROKEE - EARLY MORNING

Will in the Cherokee.  Dark circles under his eyes.  Suit

jacket wrinkled.  Pulls in next to Francis' squad car.

Francis turns.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHTMUTE MORGUE - EARLY MORNING

Will walking down a hallway.  Fluorescent lights.

Cinderblock walls.  On his cell phone.

Stops at an open doorway in time to see

THE CORONER pull a sheet over the cold, blue body of Hap

Eckhart.

Will's heart lurches.  He grabs on to the door jamb.  Wasn't

ready for that.  The coroner looks up.

Will clears his throat.  Closes his cell phone.

The coroner nods.  Goes to wash her hands.

Shrugs off her lab coat.  She's wearing a blue dress.  Looks

like a piano teacher.  Heads into an adjoining office.

Will.  Alone.  Steps into the room.  The smell of

formaldehyde.  Bloody instruments on a stainless steel tray.

Walks towards the clipboard, eyes flicking over to the shape

under the sheet when...

SUDDENLY Hap's HAND drops down.  Thick fingers.  Wedding

band.

Will jumps...

The coroner re-emerges from the office with a manila

envelope.  Hap Eckhart written on it in black pen.

Will rubs his face.  Tries to focus on the clipboard.  The

coroner holds out the envelope.  Smiles.

He takes the envelope.  The coroner peers up at him.

INT. BULLPEN - NIGHTMUTE PD - DAY

Fred Duggar, dialing the phone at his cluttered desk.

He looks up.  Will standing before him, holding the manila

envelope.

INT. STORAGE ROOM - NIGHTMUTE PD - DAY

CLOSE on a key slipping into a padlock.  Opens with a CLICK!

PULL BACK to reveal Fred and Will in a small storage room.

Standing in front of an army-green LOCKER.  The evidence

locker.  Room's stuffed with old files and boxes.  MOOSE

ANTLERS hanging over a small window.  Will glances up.

Fred throws a look over his shoulder.  Opens the locker.

INSIDE THE LOCKER - another manila envelope.  The name on

this one: Farrell Brooks.

Fred reaches back for the other envelope.  Will, hesitant to

give it to him.  Feeling the bump of the bullet in the bottom

corner.  Hands it over.  Wipes his brow.

Fred slides it in beside Farrell's.  Closes the locker door.

Fred turns, a twinkle in his eye.

Will looks at him.  At the key.  Plucks it from his hand.

Just then Nyback's SECRETARY appears in the doorway.

INT. BULLPEN - NIGHTMUTE PD - DAY

The secretary hands Will the phone.  Pulls something from

under the desk.  A beat-up BOX.  Will's name on it.

Will glances at it.  Takes the phone.  Rubs his eyes.

Nothing.  Someone's there but they're not saying anything.

Will, too tired for this shit...

Then...the VOICE.  A MAN's voice.  Not John Warfield's.

This voice is medium-ranged.  Higher.  Nose sounds stuffed.

Will straightens.  Something weird.

A little TITTER on the other end.

A PAUSE.  Will loosens his tie.

The voice.  Dropping to a WHISPER.

Will, furrows his brow.

CLOSE ON

Will Dormer's face.

As all the blood drains from it.

As all SOUND

fades around him.

As his heart

begins to POUND against his chest.

He falters, reaching out for the desk.  To steady himself.

As if the floor's just dropped out beneath him.  Eyes,

darting around the bullpen...

CHIEF NYBACK, exits his office.  Looks at Will and smiles.

CLICK.  The line goes dead.

Will, throat constricted.  Listening to the DIAL TONE.

Smiles back at Nyback.  Turns.  Slowly hangs up the phone.

White as a sheet.  Trying to act normal.  Trying to act calm.

SOUND returning to the bullpen, like nothing's different.

Looks over at

THE BOX

sitting on the edge of the secretary's desk.  He reaches for

it.  Carefully, rips the packing tape.  Bends back a flap.

Inside, some dark blue material.  An embroidered daisy.

Kay Connell's knapsack.

EXT. NIGHTMUTE POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY

Will, heading for the Cherokee.  Clutching the box.  Face

pale, pace quick.  Everything's different now.

He closes his eyes.  Now is not the time.  Reaches the

Cherokee.  Yanks open the driver's side door.  Ellie catches

up with him.  Out of breath.

She smiles, holds up some PHOTOGRAPHS.  They're of the BEACH.

The ones Kepp took.  Almost all fog.

Will.  Barely glancing at them.  Tosses the box into the car.

Gets in and closes the door.  Puts his hand over the box.

Ellie comes up to the window.

Will, about to seriously lose his shit.  Looks at Ellie.

Eyes dark, distant.

He turns the ignition.  Pulls out with a SQUEAL.  Ellie

steps back, watching him drive away.  More curious than

stung.

EXT. OUTSIDE NIGHTMUTE - DAY

The Cherokee.  Parked off-road.  A remote spot by the water.

The driver's side door, left open.  The PING-PING-PING of the

interior BELL.

EXT. BREAKFRONT - DAY

Will Dormer, walking along a breakfront.  Aimless.  One foot

in front of the other.  Staring out at nothing.  The endless

sea.  Waves CRASHING.  Wind HOWLING.  Seagulls SCREECHING.

Everything.  Closing in on him...

He stumbles over a rock.  Grabs his head in his hands.

Stunned.  Guilty.  Ashamed.  Fucked.

He saw it.  He saw it!

A WAVE, explodes nearby.  Drenching him in sea spray.

Will turns, raking his hand across his face.  Blinking.  Eyes

stinging.  Trying to focus.  Trying to think this through...

Hears a dog BARKING in the distance.

Shakes his head.  Looks at his watch.

Got to deal with the problem at hand.

INT. WILL'S ROOM - PIONEER LODGE - DAY

Will, bursts into his room at the Lodge.  The shoulders of

his coat still wet with sea spray.  Crosses to the area of

the floor where Kay Connell's files are still spread out.

Starts pressing the floorboards with the toe of his boot.

Testing.  Testing.  Until...he finds the one that SQUEAKS.

Gets down on his knees.  Hesitates.  Then jams his fingers in

around the loose board.  Starts pulling it up.  Face

reddening.  Knuckles whitening.  Slips his hand into the gap.

Pulls out a muddy 357 RUGER.

The killer's gun.

Will, stares down at it.

INT. ALLEY - DAY

Will, standing at the mouth of the ALLEY.  Just like the

night before.  Steps inside.  Cautious.  Eyes darting.

Peering into the shadows for the HOMELESS MAN...

Not there.  Coast's clear.  Heads for the dumpster at the end

of the alley.  Shoves it aside.  Looks down at...

The DEAD DOG.  Rancid.  Rotting.  Will gags.  Holds a

handkerchief to his face.  Waving away the flies.

Then.  Pulls the 357 Ruger from his pocket.  Shrugs his coat

off and wraps it around his hand and the gun.  Looks away.

Fires a muffled SHOT into the dog's side.  The body kicks.

Crouches down.  Feels along the dog's ribs for the bullet's

point of entry.  Finds it.  Pulls out a PENKNIFE and extends

one of the blades.  Cuts into the gash, fingers probing deep

for the lodged bullet.  He finds it.  Pulls it out.

Looks back at the dog.  Takes a deep breath.  Wipes his brow.

A little smear of the dog's blood left on his forehead.

Turns and pulls a bottle of RUBBING ALCOHOL from his pocket.

Douses the bullet.  Cleaning it.  Glancing at his watch.

Running out of time...

EXT. NIGHTMUTE POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY

The rear of the Nightmute PD building.  Will, looking around,

heads briskly for the back door...

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHTMUTE PD - DAY

...steps into the HALLWAY leading towards the bullpen.  Hears

VOICES.  Nearby.  Ducks back.  Waiting for them to fade.

Safe.  Heads down towards the STORAGE ROOM.  Glancing briefly

at the PICTURES hanging on the wall.  Of old time POLICE

OFFICERS.  Striking brave poses...

INT. STORAGE ROOM - NIGHTMUTE PD - DAY

The storage room.  Hot.  Stifling.  The moose antlers LOOMING

over his shoulder.  Will pulls the evidence locker key from

his pocket.  Unlocks the padlock.  Swings the door open.

Pulls the Hap Eckhart envelope out.  Throwing a look over his

shoulder.  Opens it.  Shakes out the bullet that was lodged

in Hap's spine.  Then fishes a plastic bag from his pocket.

The bullet he shot into the dead dog.  Drops that into the

envelope and reseals it.  Hands shaking.

Something.  Catches the corner of his eye.  He turns.

HIS REFLECTION in the locker mirror.  The blood smear still

on his forehead.

Will jumps.  Quickly wipes the smear off and turns.  Fred

Duggar standing behind him.  RICH by his side.  Will clears

his throat, shoves Hap's envelope into Fred's hand.  Then

Farrell's.  Angry.

SLAMS the locker door and brushes past him.  Fred and Rich

exchange a glance.

EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHTMUTE - DAY

CLOSE ON a YOUNG GIRL's face.  Dark hair held up in two

barrettes, wind tousling the curls.  Reading from a piece of

paper.

PULL BACK to reveal Kay Connell's funeral.  PEOPLE standing

by the grave, most of them HIGH SCHOOLERS.  The sky's a

brilliant blue.  Red fireweeds blanket the hillside.

FRED, ELLIE AND WILL

stand off to the side.  Dressed in black.  Fred looks like

he's never worn a tie before.  Ellie holds a potted plant.  A

gift for the bereaved.

Will.  Eyes bloodshot.  Not really listening.  Not really

paying attention.  A thousand miles away.  Tugs at his

collar.  Feels tight.

The young girl looks up.  Folds the paper closed.  People

SNIFFLE.  Mrs. Connell, reaches out to squeeze her arm.

Some CHILDREN.  Start circulating with plastic buckets.

Filled with white carnations.  Handing them out.

Will, startled, looks down.  A LITTLE GIRL stands before him.

Curly hair.  Glasses.  Holding up a bucket.  He shakes his

head.  Looks back up at

THE MOURNERS lining up to place the carnations on Kay's

casket.

AN OLD MAN with a brass-tipped cane.  Two GIRLS, look like

sisters, holding each other up.  A MAN with a thick red

beard.  A LITTLE BOY, about five, clutching a FLUTE tied with

a pink ribbon...

Will, looks away.  Then.  At the end of the line.  Something

catches his eye.

RANDY STETZ

in tight jeans and a down vest.  In front of him stands a

GIRL with white-blonde hair.

From the torn pictures in Kay Connell's room.

Will, straightens at the sight of her.

Sees Randy surreptitiously caress her ass.

EXT. CEMETERY - LATER

The service is over.  People are heading back to their cars.

Fred yanks off his tie.  Looks at Ellie.

He starts off.  Ellie, looks back at Will.

Ellie nods.  Catches up to Fred.  Will turns his attention

back to RANDY AND THE GIRL.  Over at the far end of the

cemetery.  Standing next to Randy's motorcycle.

EXT. AT THE EDGE OF THE FOREST - MINUTES LATER

Randy gets on his bike, strapping his helmet on.  The girl's

about to get on behind him.

They look over.  WILL walking towards them.  The wind

whipping his jacket.  His tie.  Randy makes a face.

Will arrives at the bike.  The girl, TANYA FRANCKE, looks at

him curiously.  Her long white-blonde hair, her skin almost

translucent.  Something sexy about her.  Has the carnation

stuck in the buttonhole of her jean jacket.

EXT. GRAVESITE - CONTINUOUS

Fred shakes Mrs. Connell's hand.  Ellie waits.  Looks over

and sees

WILL standing with Tanya and Randy.

Shifts the plant in her hands.

EXT. AT THE EDGE OF THE FOREST - CONTINUOUS

Will shows the gold shield on his belt.

Randy kick starts the bike.  It dies.  He kicks it again.

Calls out over his shoulder.

INT. CHEROKEE - FOREST - DAY

Sunlight dappling through tall fir trees.  Will drives.

Tanya sitting next to him.  Her black skirt riding up.

Picking at the flaking polish on her nails.

Will, shifts.  Looks over.

Tanya hesitates.  Pulls a cigarette from her purse.

Tanya shrugs.  Lights the cigarette.  Takes a drag.

She stretches.  Her midriff showing.  Shifts her body towards

Will.

Tanya makes a face.  Reaches out and taps the hula-girl.

Will looks over at her.  She blows out a plume of smoke.

Smiles.  Seductive.

She reaches out a sinewy arm.  Starts massaging the back of

Will's neck.

Will, impervious to the touch.  Head, throbbing.  Reaches for

the gear.  His foot, pressing harder on the gas.

EXT. CHEROKEE - FOREST ROAD - CONTINUOUS

SCREECH!  The Cherokee whips around a curve.

INT. CHEROKEE - CONTINUOUS

Tanya giggles.  Likes the speed.  Will, goes even faster.

EXT. CHEROKEE - CONTINUOUS

The Cherokee breaks free from the forest.  Racing along a

coastal road.  Water CRASHING against the rocks.

Up ahead, a LOGGING TRUCK coming the other way.  The Cherokee

shifts lanes.  Heading straight for the truck.

INT. CHEROKEE - CONTINUOUS

Tanya looks out at the truck.  Still giggling.

The truck BEEPS.  Will goes faster.  Tanya takes her hand

from Will's neck.  Holds on to her seat.

EXT. CHEROKEE - CONTINUOUS

The gap's closing fast.  The truck BEEPS again.

INT. CHEROKEE - CONTINUOUS

Tanya looks over at Will.  Not giggling any more.

Will goes even faster...

EXT. CHEROKEE - COASTAL ROAD

The truck and the Cherokee.  On a collision course.  The

truck BEEPS wildly.

INT. CHEROKEE - CONTINUOUS

Tanya squirming in her seat.  Not liking this any more.

Will staring dead ahead.  Tensing his jaw.  The TRUCK...

bearing down on them...

Tanya reaches for the wheel...Will pushes her hands away...

The TRUCK...a breath away...

EXT. CHEROKEE - COASTAL ROAD

The truck and the Cherokee...just feet from each other...at

the last moment...the Cherokee jerks out of the way...

EXT. ICICLE FISHING CANNERY - DAY

...SCREECHES to a stop near an old sign, Icicle Cannery.

Gravel flying.  Will gets out.  Slams his door.  Rounds the

car and opens Tanya's door.  She's screaming at him.

Will reaches in and pulls her out of the car.

Will pulls her up a steep hill of garbage and broken crates.

Pushes her down the other side.  She stumbles.

Will stands above her, on the hill.  His face set like stone.

Tanya steps back.

He grabs her by the arm.  Jerks it up.  She CRIES out.  Will

leans in.

Tanya's eyes grow wide.  She looks around her.  Disgusting,

rotten.  A SEAGULL pecking at the body of a dead bird.  She

tries to break away...

Tanya looks away.

She struggles more.  No good.  Will's grip is like a vice.

Tanya, squirming.  Angry.

Will straightens.  He's heard that name before.

Suddenly Tanya jams her heel into his shoe.  He CRIES out.

She breaks away from him.  Runs up the hill.  Turns.  Tears

streaking her face.  Throws the carnation to the ground.

INT. BOOKSTORE - NIGHTMUTE - DAY

CLOSE ON a FINGER.  Running along a row of book spines.

Brundt...Buckley...Buss...Buckham...Byrie...

PULL BACK to reveal will in Nightmute's small bookstore.

Still in his funeral clothes.

In the "Mystery!" section.  Not finding what he wants.  Then,

something catches his eye:  A BARGAIN BIN at the end of the

aisle.  Will limps down to it.  Avoides eye-contact with a

YOUNG WOMAN shelving "New Arrivals!"

Reaches into the bin.  Rummages through some paperbacks.

Then he finds it:  Otherwise Engaged by Walter Byrd.

Underneath the title, he finds what he's looking for:

Another J. Brody Mystery.  Flips to the inside of the cover.

A BLURRY PICTURE of Walter Byrd.  Head turned to the side.

Walter Byrd was born in Watson Lake, Canada.  He graduated...

Will's eyes skip down to the bottom:

Mr. Byrd currently lives in Umkumiut, Alaska, with his two

labrador retrievers, Lucy and Desi.

Will looks up.  Slaps the book closed.

INT./EXT. CHEROKEE - ROAD - DAY

Will drives, sipping take-out coffee.  Trying to fight the

stinging in his eyes.  Passes a sign:  Umkumiut, 30 miles.

EXT. TESORO ALASKA GAS STATION - UMKUMIUT - DAY

Will stands in a phone booth at the gas station.  Flips

through the phone book.  His finger tracing down the "B"s.

Finds it:  Walter Byrd, 451 S. Diamond Tooth, Apt. B.

EXT. DIAMOND TOOTH ROAD - UMKUMIUT - DAY

Sky's become overcast.  Will stands across the street from a

pale blue building.  On the ground floor, a tackle store.

Above, looks like several apartment units.

He starts across.

INT. HALLWAY - APARTMENTS - DAY

Will heads down a narrow hallway.  Tiled floor.  Passes door

"A."  Stops at the next one, "B."  Knocks.  Hears nothing but

the muted tv from apartment "A."  Pulls out his gloves.

INT. WALTER BYRD'S APARTMENT - DAY

With a CLICK the door swings open.  Will, gloves on, pockets

his credit card.  Hears the CHING CHING of dog collars as

TWO LABRADOR RETRIEVERS stand at attention, GROWLING.  Will's

prepared.  Takes a bag of treats from his pocket.

The dogs break.  Trot over to him.  Wolf down the treats.

Will scans the place.  Small, cheap.  Matching sofa and easy

chair, corduroy upholstery.  The walls, lined with old 1950s

movie posters.  All second-rate detective movies:  "Another

Shot in the Dark," "Lady Luck," "He wore a Black Hat."

Will walks across the room.  Repulsed.  The pathetic hovel of

a killer.  Looks into the

BEDROOM

Single bed.  Books and magazines.  A half-eaten tuna sandwich

on the bedside table.  "NYPD BLUE" calendar on the wall.

It's quiet.  He walks over to a large DESK by the window.

Scattered papers.  Computer.  Mini cassette recorder.

On the wall, hundreds of newspaper articles.  Some yellowing,

some fresh.  All about cops: "Officer Louis Saved My Life!"

"Shoot-out in Soho," "South Street Cop Takes Down Drug

Ring," "Seattle Cop Killed by Suspect..."

Will curls his lip.  Starts looking through the papers on the

desk.  Underneath a stack, he finds an 8x10 PHOTOGRAPH.  It's

of Byrd, standing in front of a big, lakeside HOUSE.  A RADIO

TOWER in the background.  Walter Byrd's face is blurred,

turned to the side.  The photo from the book bio.

Will takes it.  Starts roughly opening drawers.  A box of

animal crackers, a rubber band ball.  Then, shoved in the

back of the top drawer, an APPOINTMENT BOOK.  Will flips

through to today's date.  Blank.  Shoves the book into his

pocket.  Slams the door closed.

Then reaches back for his Smith 39/13.  Checks the magazine.

Slaps it back in place.  He's ready.

SUDDENLY the phone RINGS.  A beige rotary on the desk.

Plugged into an ancient answering machine.  It RINGS again.

The answering machine WHIRS.  Then BEEPS.

Will freezes.

Will turns back to the window.  Looking furiously...

Will lunges for the phone.  Snatches it up just as CLICK! the

tape cuts off.

Enraged, he PUNCHES the receiver through the wall.

INT. HALLWAY - APARTMENTS - DAY

Will exits the apartment.  Cradling his hand.  Looks down at

the tile floor.  Scanning it for a broken tile.  Finds one.

Bends down and plucks out a broken corner.

Places it carefully where the bottom of the door meets the

door jamb.  Just then.  His BEEPER goes off.

INT. BULLPEN - NIGHTMUTE PD - DAY

Will strides into the bullpen.  Wounded hand in pocket.

Ellie hunts and pecks at a typewriter.  Glances up.

Fred, over in the corner.  SLAMS a drawer in the filing

cabinet.  Turns.

Holds out a one-page report.

Will takes the report.  Heads over to the coffee machine.

He reaches into his desk drawer and pulls out a book.  Holds

it up.  Otherwise Engaged.  In hardback.

Will blinks.

Will pours himself a cup of coffee.  Trying to keep the

stream steady.  Ellie continues typing...CLACK...CLACK...

CLACK...CLACK...CLACK...Will rubs his chin.  Looks back at

the report.  Judicious.

The CLACKING stops.  SILENCE.  Will turns around.  Ellie's

staring right at him - that isn't like him.

He turns back to Fred.  Beat.

The CLACKING resumes.

INT. STAIRWAY - DIAMOND TOOTH ROAD - UMKUMIUT - LATE NIGHT

A dark stairway.  Late at night.  Will, bathed in shadows.

Climbs to the top.  Quietly, carefully.  He heads down a

hallway.  We recognise it.  Back where Walter Byrd lives.

Will approaches apartment "B."  Slowly pulls out his weapon.

Cocks it.  Waits a beat then swings out in front of the door.

Ready to fight.  Ready to confront.  Looks down...

Tile corner's still there.

INT./EXT. CHEROKEE - UMKUMIUT - NEXT DAY

CLOSE ON Walter Byrd's APPOINTMENT BOOK laying open.

Scrawled in pencil:  8:30.  Dr. Agee.

PULL BACK to reveal Will sitting in the parked Cherokee.  The

appointment book on the passenger seat.  Been there all night.

Insomnia.  Taking its toll.  His hair, no longer neatly

combed.  His face, pale and unshaven.  His eyes, dragged open

from fatigue.  Looks like the whole world's pulling him down.

Staring down the street at a

BRICK BUILDING on the corner.  A placard by the front door:

Dr. Florence Agee, D.D.S.

Will checks his watch.  Rubs his eyes with the heels of his

hands.  Suddenly.  Something tells him to look up.

A MAN

in the distance, walking along the road.  Towards Dr. Agee's.

He's in his forties.  Short, shoulders sloped.  Wears a

beige, zip-up windbreaker, khakis, brown desert boots.

WALTER BYRD

has a bulky hearing aid in one ear.  Is looking down at the

road.  Glances up.

LOCKS EYES WITH WILL

Byrd, slows his pace.

Will, reaches for the door handle.

SUDDENLY

Byrd turns in the other direction, starts walking fast.

Will leaps out of the Cherokee and heads after him.

WALTER BYRD

his short legs pumping, spots a TOUR BUS across the road.

Veers over to it.

WILL

a runner's stride.  Weaves through PEOPLE.  Closing in on

Byrd.  Sees his plan.  Cuts across the road just as...

A PICK-UP

rounds the corner.  THUMP!  Broadsides him.  Will's pitched

up and over the hood.  Falls hard on the tarmac.  Dazed for a

second.  Blood, gushing from his forehead.  Hears the PICK-UP

DOOR open...FEET running over to him.

More FEET running over.

Will opens his eyes.  Trying to focus.  Looks up and sees, in

the distance...WALTER BYRD getting on the tour bus.

Will struggles to his feet.  The OLD LADY who hit him,

wearing overalls.  Reaches out.

Will stands, wavering.  Flashes her his badge.

INT./EXT. PICK-UP

The old lady rips along in the truck.  Will sits in the

passenger seat, a handkerchief to his forehead.  It's soaked

with blood.  The lady looks over.

Will looks over at her.  Shifts in his seat.  Ouch.  Feels

like a couple cracked ribs.  Peers out the windshield at the

TOUR BUS a few cars ahead of them.

EXT. WINDY ROAD - CONTINUOUS

AERIAL VIEW of the pick-up tailing the tour bus.  A windy

coastal road.  Beyond it, a blanket of endless evergreens.

EXT. FERRY STATION - OUTSIDE UMKUMIUT - DAY

A FERRY at the end of the pier.  A small wooden booth for

selling tickets.  Beautiful, sweeping snow-capped mountains

on the other side of the bay.  Nothing else for miles around.

The pick-up pulls up next to the bus and a couple other cars.

Will jumps out.  Scans the area for Byrd.  Nothing.  Then,

sees the last few PEOPLE boarding the ferry.

INT. FERRY - MINUTES LATER

Ferry's getting pitched around in the roiling water.  Most

everyone is inside.  TOURISTS with throw-away cameras,

backpacks, anoraks, CHILDREN.  Some looking sea-sick in the

corner.

Will weaves through the crowd.  Eyes darting, searching.  The

ferry lurches to one side, the crowd sways, Will spots

WALTER BYRD standing by a window.

INT. WINDOW - FERRY

Walter holds on to the railing.  Looking at the view, the sea

spray.  Will comes up.  Stands next to him.  Cognizant of the

people around them.

Walter continues looking out the window.  That same stuffed-

nose voice.

The ferry pitches again.  Will grabs on to the railing.

Looking down at this little man.  Hate in his eyes.

Walter reaches up to blow his nose.  Will's eyes look on in

disgust - his knuckles are still red and swollen.  From

beating Kay Connell to death.

He points to his hearing-aid.

The ferry's engine HUMS to a stop.  Walter smiles.

EXT. GENDREAU GLACIER - DAY

Gendreau Glacier.  Spilling down between two huge mountains.

Enormous in its whiteness, its coldness, its silent power.

Will and Walter walk up its face, away from the other

tourists.  Walter leads the way.  Hands in his pockets.

He points off to the horizon.

Will's lip curls.  Watching him.

SUDDENLY Will lunges at him.  Walter's eyes widen in surprise

as he grabs him up by the collar.  Nose to nose.  Will barely

keeping control.

Walter flounders.

His jaws tense, nostrils flare.  Walter, red-faced,

sputtering...

Will clenches his teeth.

Just then a SHRIEK.  Will looks over

A COUPLE KIDS.  Further down the glacier.  Having a snowball

fight.

Will looks back at Walter.  Has to take it easy.  Shoves him

away in disgust.  Walter falls down onto the snow.  Dislodges

his hearing aid.

Watches Will pace.  Head throbbing.  Ribs, screaming in pain.

Walter brushes the snow off the dislodged hearing aid.  Puts

it back around his ear.

Gets up.  Brushes the snow from his butt.  Checks something

in his pocket.

Looks down at the kids.  Shakes his head.

Walter turns back to him.

Walter shrugs.

Will stops short.  Eyes burning.  It's all he can do not to

throttle this weed.

Walter looks at him.  Scratches his head.

He takes out a handkerchief.  Blows his nose.

Will stares at him.

Will runs his hands through his hair.  Half-crazed.  Heart

pounding.  Turns to watch...

THE KIDS down the glacier.  Making angels in the snow.  Their

GIGGLES carried along by the wind.

Will, squeezes his eyes shut.  Trapped.  About to defy every

instinct in his body.

Walter steps up, tapping his hearing aid.

Walter smiles.  Pleased.

Walter rubs his hands together.  Thinking.

JUST THEN the ferry blows its HORN.  Low and loud.  Walter

looks down at it.

He starts down.  Will watches him pass, has no choice but to

follow.  Walter, going over the details in his head.

Snaps his fingers.  An idea.

Will nods.  Walter smiles.  Spreads out his hands.

TOURISTS.  Boarding the ferry.

Walter heads over to the ramp.  Will stops, grabbing his

side.  A PANG through his ribs.  Excruciating.  Calls out to

Walter.

Walter looks back.  Waves.

Gives his ticket to the TICKET TAKER.  Gets on.  Walks back

to the stern.  Looks out at Will.  The HORN sounds again.

Walter, at the rail.  Smiles.  The ferry's engine, churning

up water.  Starting forward just as...

Walter takes a MINI CASSETTE RECORDER from his pocket.  Holds

it up for Will to see.

Will, on shore, sees it.  A cold flash ripping through his

body.  That motherfucker.  Bolts through some tourists

towards the ramp but...

A couple of GUYS are just pulling it in.  The Ticket Taker,

grabs his arm.

Will, jerks his arm away.  Stares off at the ferry.  Walter

Byrd and his tape recorder.  Receding into the distance.

INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHTMUTE - DAY

CLOSE ON a counter top.  Stuff thrown down.  Aspirin.  Band-

aids.  Gauze.  Medical tape.  First aid cream.  Back pills.

Sleeping pills.  Bottle of scotch.

PULL BACK to reveal Will standing at the counter in the

convenience store.  His entire body aching.  The CASHIER,

throws him a look.

EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE - MINUTES LATER

Will exits the store.  A bag under his arm.  We Miss You, Kay

looming over his shoulder.  Steps out onto the sidewalk and

sees...

ELLIE leaning against her truck.  Waiting for him.  Smiles.

A tingle, all across Will's body.  Christ.  This girl's

everywhere!  He hunches into his coat.  Flicks up his collar.

Doesn't want her to see him fully.  Nods down the road.

Ellie grabs her bag.  Joins him.  They start walking.

She pulls a folder from her bag.

Will takes the file.  Flips it open.  The death of his

partner.  Neatly typed.  Neatly stapled.  Pulls out a pen.

He signs.  Hands it back to her.  She slips it into her bag.

A slight stutter in Will's step.

Ellie looks over at Will as they cross the street.  Studying

his face.  His gait.  Noticing the slight limp in his right

leg.  The cut on his forehead.

They arrive at the stone steps of the Pioneer Lodge.

Will, finally looks at her.

Turns and starts up the steps.

Ellie, watches him for a second.  Then calls out.

Will stops, turns to look back at her.  Confused.

Slings the bag over her shoulder.

INT. WILL'S ROOM - PIONEER LODGE - LATE NIGHT

Clock flicks to 3:00 A.M.  Will, pacing in his room.  Shirt

off.  Rib cage wrapped in a bandage.  Looking through...

A STACK OF MESSAGES.  All from John Warfield.  He discards

them one by one.  Can barely focus...

SUDDENLY the phone RINGS.  He lunges for it.

Interrupted by a CLICK...

Walter Byrd's voice.  Recorded from that afternoon.

Will, hears his own voice...

Then, another clumsy CLICK.  Walter Byrd gets on.

He hangs up.

Will SLAMS down the receiver.  Then again.  And again.  Yanks

the cord out of the wall and HURLS the phone across the room.

EXT. ROCKY BEACH - OUTSIDE NIGHTMUTE - MORNING

...The DARK FIGURE.  Disappearing back into the fog.  Closing

in around him like milky water...

We whip out our SMITH 39/13...plunge in after him...taking

chase...BREATHING hard...leaping from rock to rock...the FOG,

blanket thick...tightening around us...

Our feet.  Hit water.  Up to our ankles.  Icy cold.  We

run...sloshing through...when...

SUDDENLY

A DARK FIGURE.  Appears ahead.  Big and hulking...CRASHING

towards us...

We raise our weapon...quick as a flash...as the FIGURE

emerges...

And in a split second...

WE LOCK EYES WITH FIGURE's - his eyes, brown and gentle...

CRACK!  We fire!  The FIGURE grips his gut, falls into the

water.

Heart POUNDING.  Adrenaline PUMPING.  We slosh towards the

body.  Something...catching our eye...

A 357 RUGER

lying in the rocks.  Off to the side.  We grab it.  Turn back

to the body...

And stop cold.

That's when it hits us.  That's when we realize...

INT. WILL'S ROOM - LATE NIGHT

Will bolts up.  White as a sheet.

His body, drenched in sweat.  His breathing, quick and

ragged.  Caught up in the twisted sheets of his bed.  Looks

across the room and sees

HAP

sitting in the corner.  Eating an apple with a penknife.

He smiles.  Sympathetic.  Looks over at the window just as...

The BLANKET.  Drops to the floor.

LIGHT floods the room.

INT. WILL'S ROOM - 4:02 A.M.

With a GRUNT Will puts his back into it.  Shoving the heavy

oak bureau towards the window.  Sweat beading his face.

A...few...more...shoves.  And the bureau finally stands in

front of the window.  WIll stands back to take a look.  Only

covers half of it.

INT. WILL'S ROOM - 4:35 A.M.

Red-faced, Will leans into the wooden armoire.  Shimmying it

towards the window...

EXT. PIONEER LODGE - NIGHT

Ellie.  Sitting in her truck.  Parked behind the Pioneer

Lodge.  Rubbbing her eyes.  Sleepy.  Looking up at

WILL'S WINDOW

concerned.

INT. WILL'S ROOM - 4:35 A.M.

With one last heave, Will gets the armoire to the window.

Light still shining through the cracks.

INT. WILL'S ROOM - 4:50 A.M.

Will shoving magazines, blankets, sheets, pillows.  Anything.

To fill the cracks.  To cover the light.  His eyes.  Like a

crazy man's...

SUDDENLY a knock on the door.  Will turns.

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Rachel standing out in the hallway.  Will opens the door.

Will gives a half-smile.  Fucking irony.  Heads back into...

INT. WILL'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

...his room.  Rachel follows.  Looks around at the mess.

Will grabs up a sweater.

He heads back over to the window.  Rachel now notices all the

stuff piled up.  Softens her voice.

Will.  Cramming the sweater into a crack.

Rachel walks up behind him.  His cramming, more desperate.

More urgent.

He grabs a magazine.

Rachel reaches out.  Catches his arm.

He stops.  Looks down at her hand.

Will suddenly realises what he's doing.  Absurd.  Pathetic.

Pitiful.  Slowly turns to face Rachel.

Her eyes, looking up at him.  His shoulders droop.

Exhausted.  Rachel reaches up.  Catches him in her arms.

Strong arms.  Caring.  Will buries his face in her neck.

Wants to be swallowed up.

Rachel holds him.  Arms encircling.  Will breathes her in.

Sweet, soft, safe.

Looks up.  His mouth suddenly finding hers.  A kiss, hungry,

urgent.  His arms move to surround her.

INT. WILL'S ROOM - LATER

Will and Rachel in bed.  Spooning.  Rachel behind will, her

finger tracing his scar.  Rain DRUMS against the window.

Will.  Watching the raindrops streaming down the glass.

Casting strange shadows against the wall.

Will tenses his jaw.  Rachel, listens in horror.

Rachel reaches for Will's hand.  Squeezes it.

He pauses.

Will turns slowly over to face her.  Her hair, splayed out on

the pillow.  Her cheeks, flushed.  Her eyes, listening.

Rachel looks at him.  Goose pimples on her arms.  Realising

the weight of the confession.

He sits up.  Abrupt.  Wincing from the pain in his ribs.

Rests his arms on his knees.

Rachel rubs his shoulder.

Will closes his eyes.  The rain, PATTERING.  Rhythmic.

There's a PAUSE.  Rachel, studying Will's back.  The cuts.

The bruises.  Not sure how to answer.

Looks out the window.

INT. WILL'S ROOM - MORNING

The clock reads 6:00.  Will pulls on his trousers.  Goes to

strap on his Smith 39/13 holster.  Grimaces with pain.  Looks

at his back in the full-length mirror.  BLACK BRUISES seeping

out from under his bandage.

Puts the 39/13 and holster in the top drawer of the bureau.

Turns and looks down at Rachel.  Sleeping soundly.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Will in the interrogation room.  Standing by the window.

Tensed jaw.

WALTER BYRD

sits at the table.  Hair combed, wet.  Shirt newly starched.

A Styrofoam cup of coffee in front of him.  Playing the part.

Fred sits opposite him.  Report file open.  Ellie, next to

Fred.  Taking notes.  She's combed her hair, too.

Walter smiles modestly.  Looks over at Ellie.

Fred shoots Ellie a look.  She closes her mouth.

Ellie hands Fred the hardback of Otherwise Engaged.  He holds

it up.  Opened to the signature.

Will, from over by the window.  Interrupts.

Walter looks over.  Wide-eyed.

Will turns.  Accusatory.

Walter blinks.

Fred shoots Will a look.  Ellie, watching him.

Will heads over to Walter's chair.  Fists clenched in his

pockets.

He turns to Fred and Ellie.

Fred stops Will with a look.  Had enough.

Tense BEAT.  Will stares at Walter.  Revulsion.  Heads back

over to the window.

Fred, sits up.

Walter hesitates.  Takes a sip of coffee.

Walter furrows his brow.  Taps his hearing aid.

Ellie's eyes widen.  Fred glances at Will.  But Will's too

busy watching this little man weave his web.

Walter looks right at her.

Fred stands.  This is big.  Calls out the door.

Walter takes a sip of his coffee.  Cup's empty.  Holds it out

to Ellie.  Smiles.

Ellie nods, takes the cup.  Heads over to the coffee machine.

Fred turns back to the door...

AND AT THAT MOMENT Walter levels a look right at Will.

Mouths the words Wild Card.

A shiver down Will's spine.  Wild card.  The gun.  Randy.

ELLIE

over at the coffee machine.  Pouring coffee.  Glances up at

the window.  Catches the reflection of the two men.

An intense look between them.

EXT. ROCKY BEACH - OUTSIDE NIGHTMUTE - DAY

CLOSE ON a BOOT.  Jumping down onto a black rock.

PULL BACK to reveal Ellie walking out on the beach.  Heading

down towards the water.  Thinking.

INT. RANDY STETZ'S ROOM - NIGHTMUTE - DAY

A dark, narrow boarding room.  A HAND reaches through an open

window.  Feels for the lock on the door.  CLICK.

Will enters Randy Stetz's place.  Cigarette butts, electric

guitar, Hustler centerfolds tacked on the walls.

He looks around.  Every inch of him revolting against what

he's about to do.

EXT. ROCKY BEACH - CONTINUOUS

The sound of waves.  A slight breeze.  Ellie walking along

the water.

Looking down.  Brow furrowed.  Stops and puts her hands on

her hips.

INT. RANDY STETZ'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Will heads over to a hanging sheet on the other side of the

room.  Pulls it aside.  A MOTORBIKE being repaired.  Parts

and tools all over the place.

Pulls the 357 Ruger from his pocket with a handkerchief.

Spots a COFFEE CAN on a shelf.  Filled with thick oil.

EXT. ROCKY BEACH - CONTINUOUS

Something catches Ellie's eye.  GLINTING from between the

rocks.  She bends down.  Pulls a pencil from her backpack.

Spears something and holds it up.

A SHELL CASING.

INT. RANDY STETZ'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Will, drops the 357 into the oil.  Turns and heads back

across the room.  Hesitates.  At the door.  Turns back.

Looking at the oil can.  Takes a step back towards it when he

hears...

The sound of a SQUAD CAR.  Pulling up outside.

Too late.

EXT. RANDY STETZ'S ROOM - LATER

Will stands just outside the doorway into Randy's room.

UNIFORMED OFFICERS inside searching the place.  Tearing down

pictures.  Turning out doors.  Ripping up carpet.  Randy's

voice.  In protest.

Will hears some SCUFFLING.  The sheet being pulled down.  The

CLATTER of tools.

Parts pulled off the shelves.  The bike, shoved to the side.

Then.  A SILENCE.  Followed by...

Will shuts his eyes.  Heavy FOOTSTEPS head over to the bike.

Someone's pulled the gun from the can.

Fred's voice, calm.

More FOOTSTEPS.  Randy, desperate.

Will opens his eyes.  Fred's voice.  Almost sympathetic.

More SCUFFLING.  A chair knocked over.  Something SMASHES.

Will looks down at the floor as

FRED AND A UNIFORMED COP struggle to drag Randy through the

doorway.  Randy writhes, kicks, tugs.  Screams.

Fred grabs Randy's shoulder.

Randy squirms.  Turns.  Looks right into Will's eyes.  Gone

is the bluster.  Gone is the attitude.  Randy Stetz, lost

kid.  Tears streaming down his face.

EXT. GARAGE APARTMENT - DAY

Will stands outside the garage apartment.  Wind whipping his

coat.  Watches as a Nightmute PD SQUAD CAR pulls off with

Randy Stetz in the back.

Fred sees him, heads over.

Will shifts his eyes to him.

Fred half-smiles.  Watches the receding squad car.

Will barely nods.  Fred pulls his baseball cap on.

Fred puts out his hand to shake.  Truce.  Will looks at him.

Takes it.

INT. SHANTY BAR - NIGHTMUTE - NIGHT

CLOSE ON a tray of dark beer.  Five glasses, foam sloshing.

PULL BACK to reveal Farrell, Rich, Francis, and Will sitting

at a small, round table.  Fred's passing out the beers.  Dive

bar.  MUSIC blaring.  3 a.m. Happy Hour! banner on the wall.

Place packed with rough-looking FISHERMEN.

Rich takes a glass from Fred.

Fred sits.  Takes a sip of his beer.  To Farrell.

Farrell shifts in his seat.

Will nods.  Jostled by the crowd.  Reaches for his beer.

He and Francis GUFFAW.

Farrell looks over at Will.

Will slams down his empty glass.  Squeezes his eyes open and

shut.  Loud music.  Cigarette smoke.

Fred pats Will's shoulder.

Francis grabs a handful of peanuts.

Will turns to Fred.  Wiping the foam from his moustache.

JUST THEN.

They look up.  Ellie standing by their table.  Jeans, down

vest.  Hair tousled.

Fred leans back in his seat.  Eyeballs Ellie.

Ellie reaches into her vest pocket.  Pulls out a Ziploc with

the SHELL CASING inside.

Will, blanches.

Rich throws peanut shells at her.

Ellie brushes off the shells.  Looks right at Will.

Everyone turns to Will.  Their faces, spinning.  He nods.

He looks up.  Holds her gaze.  Then turns away.  Grabs the

side of the table.

The guys don't protest.  Will starts heading for the bar.

Weaving through broad shoulders, massive backs.  Smoke.

MUSIC.  Laughter.  Arguing.  A mass of bodies and sound.

Like being swallowed up in a black hole...

Looks back at the table.

Ellie, watching him.

EXT. ELLIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Ellie's truck pulls up in front of a small house.  She jumps

out.

INT. FRONT HALLWAY - HOUSE - NIGHT

SLAM!  Ellie heads through the front door like a gust of

wind.  Thunders up the stairs.  Calls out.

We hear the TV in the other room.  An older MAN, Ellie's

father, appears in the doorway.  Thick glasses, grey stubble,

big paunch.  Wearing a flannel robe.

Ellie appears at the top of the stairs.

INT. BASEMENT

Pitch black, then, CLICK! as a bare lightbulb's switched on.

Ellie stands beneath it.  Piles of crap everywhere.

She steps through the quagmire of old bikes, fans, auto

parts.  Over to a stack of cardboard BOXES in the corner.

She nudges through them, reading the writing on the tops.  In

thick black pen.  Shoves a couple aside.

Then.  Finds what she's looking for.  Pulls down a box

marked:  Ellie Acad.  Tears it open.

INSIDE - piles of papers, polaroids of her and her FRIENDS,

schedules, syllabi, handbooks.  Stuff from her Academy year.

At the bottom, a report.  The title:  "Securing the Crime

Scene," the Leland Street Murders.  By Eleanor P. Burr.

Ellie pulls it out.  Sits down on an old stool.  Opens to the

middle of the report.  Her finger, tracing down the

typewritten page.  Flips to the next page.  Then the next.

The next.  Then.  She spots it.

THREE-QUARTERS DOWN THE PAGE, her finger finds the

sentence:...Detective Dormer's unregistered Smith and Wesson

model 39/13 9mm, to immobilize Langley...

Ellie looks up.  Chews her bottom lip.

EXT. MARINERS MEMORIAL - OUTSIDE NIGHTMUTE - DAY

CLOSE ON a huge wave CRASHING against a retaining wall.

Spray flying.

PULL BACK to reveal a small monument by the sea.  A stone

cupola with a bronze statue underneath.  The sky, black with

clouds.

INT. MARINER'S MEMORIAL - CONTINUOUS

Walter Byrd waits under the Mariner's Memorial.  Wind

whipping his jacket, the green sea churning behind him.  Next

to a fifteen-foot statue of a SEAMAN, tall, rugged, tough.

Holding on to a thick coil of rope.

Hunches against the wind.  Watches as...

WILL approaches the monument.  Sonics sweatshirt, wrinkled

coat.  Face drawn and haggard.  Angry.

Will enters the monument.

A gust of wind WHORLS through the monument.

Will's eyes pierce into him.

Will holds out his hand.

Walter looks at the open hand.  Hugs his jacket to him.

Will breaks.  Rushes Walter.  Slams him against one of the

concrete pilasters.

Another wave CRASHES.  Sprays them.  Walter looks up into

Will's bloodshot eyes.

Will tightens his grip.

He holds up the tape.  Will grabs it, shoves Walter to the

side.  Yanks the tape out of the cassette.  Steps back and

HURLS it into the sea.  Waves engulf it hungrily.

Walter watches him.

PAUSE.

Will curls his fists.

Whips around...

Steps closer to him.  Beseeching.

A couple RAVENS alight nearby.  Flapping their wings.

SCREECHING into the wind.

A dark shadow crosses his face.  Holds on to the coiled rope

of the statue.  Will hisses.

Walter.  Squeezing the bronze rope.

Locks eyes with Will.  Conspiratorial.

WILL'S HAND shoots out.  Clamps around Walter's neck.

Walter's face, starts turning red.

Will looks deep into Walter's eyes.  Squeezing harder.  Pure

hatred.

Their eyes, locked.  Veins, popping along Walter's temples.

Lip quivering...

JUST THEN a BELL sounds in the distance.  Will looks up.

A LINE OF FISHING BOATS coming back in.

Will, looks back at Walter.  Throws him to the ground.

Sickened.

Walter COUGHS.  Holding his neck.  Enjoying this.

Will shoots him a look.

He pulls himself to his feet.  A little unsteady.  Takes out

a handkerchief.  Dabs his forehead.

He shrugs.  Walks past Will.

Will turns.  Watches him walk away.  Walter hesitates.  Turns

back.

Will looks at him.  Back straightening.

Will's stomach jumps.  Walter turns back.  Continues on.

The little man in a beige windbreaker.

INT. CHIEF CHARLES NYBACK'S OFFICE - NIGHTMUTE PD - DAY

CLOSE ON a HAND.  Signing the bottom of a form.

PULL BACK to reveal Chief Nyback sitting at his desk.  Will

stands before him.  Signing papers.  A bottle of bourbon on

the desk.  Some paper cups half filled.

Will checks his watch.

Fred, standing over by the filing cabinet.  Toothpick in his

mouth.

Nyback chuckles.

Will shakes his head.

Looks over at Fred picking his teeth.

Will caps the pen.  Uncomfortable.  Nods towards Fred.

JUST THEN the door swings open.  They look over as

ELLIE hurries in.  She smiles.  Looks tired.

An awkward beat.  Ellie walks over to Will.  Looks up.

Suddenly throws her arms around him.

Will holds his hands out.  Not sure what to do.  Looks down

at the top of Ellie's head.

ELLIE'S HAND

slips down his back.  Feeling for a holster.  For that 39/13.

Nothing.  She breaks away.

She and Will lock eyes.  Hold for a beat.

He knows exactly what she was trying to do.

INT./EXT. JEEP CHEROKEE - NIGHTMUTE - DAY

Will, driving down Nightmute's main street.  He takes a left.

Goes up a hill.  Glances out the window.  Passing by

THE CEMETERY.  A cluster of headstones.  Something catches

his eye.  He stops the car.

EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHTMUTE - DAY

Will, walking up to the wrought-iron gate surrounding the

cemetery.  Stops.  Puts his hands up to the bars.

KAY CONNELL'S GRAVE

on the other side.  Newly dug.  A mound of dirt.  Flowers,

scattered by the wind.  Daughter and Friend...1982-1999.

Will.  Grips the bars.  As if he's seeing it for the first

time.  Really seeing it.

Closes his eyes.

What have I done?

INT. WILL'S ROOM - PIONEER LODGE - EVENING

Will's REFLECTION in the mirror.  He's showered.  Hair's

combed.  Put on a clean suit.  Steps back.  Smooths down his

lapels.  Just right.

Turns to face the room.  Bed's made, mess cleaned up.  He

heads over to the bureau, pulls out his Smith 39/13.  Lays it

on the bed.

Unclips his badge from his belt.  Lays it on the bed.  Takes

something from the bedside table.  The BULLET found in Hap

Eckhart.  Lays it on the bed.

All neat.  All ordered.

Reaches under the mattress.  Pulls out the PHOTOGRAPH of a

blurry Walter Byrd standing in front of a house.  A radio

tower in the background.  The call numbers: WKOZ.

Will studies it.  Tears it in half.

INT. BACK ROOM - PIONEER LODGE - EVENING

Rachel in the back room behind reception.  A pullman's

kitchen, a desk, an old recliner.  Pouring some milk into a

bowl for a CAT.  A stray.

Will walks in.  Rachel turns, smiles.

Will walks up to her.  Puts his arms around her.  Holds her,

smells her, kisses her neck.  Pulls away.  Looks into her

eyes.

He doesn't answer.  The cat, rubs against his leg.  PURRING.

INT./EXT. JEEP CHEROKEE - EVENING

Will driving along a forest road.  Eyes dead ahead.  A map on

the passenger seat.  By the fold, Kgun Lake circled in pencil.

INT. BULLPEN - NIGHTMUTE PD - CONTINUOUS

Ellie working at her desk.  Looks up at the clock: 6:00.

Gets up, grabs her down vest.  Heads for the door.  Farrell

sticks the tip of his crutch in her path.  She stumbles.

EXT. ROAD TO KGUN LAKE - EVENING

AERIAL VIEW of the silver Jeep Cherokee.  The only car on the

road.  The sky, white-grey.  The trees, a blanket of green.

The Cherokee heads around a hairpin curve.

INT. LOBBY - PIONEER LODGE - EVENING

Rachel at reception.  Reading the paper.  Ellie walks in.

INT./EXT. JEEP CHEROKEE - ROAD TO KGUN LAKE - EVENING

Will, scanning the treeline.  Takes a left fork then stops.

Thought he saw something.  Grinds the gear, backs up.  Takes

another look.

IN THE DISTANCE, a radio tower.  WKOZ.

INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE WILL'S ROOM - EVENING

Rachel and Ellie, standing outside Will's room.  Ellie knocks

again.

INT. WILL'S ROOM - PIONEER LODGE - EVENING

The CLICK of a key and the door opens.  Ellie strides in.

She stops.  Rachel behind her.  Taking in the strange feeling

in the room.  Walks over to the bed.  Eyes riveted on the

39/13.  On the bullet.  Rachel, behind her.

Ellie, her mind races.  Notices TORN PHOTOGRAPH PIECES in the

trash can.  Reaches in and pulls some out.  A puzzle.

INT./EXT. JEEP CHEROKEE - LAKE KGUN

Will stops the car at the end of a narrow dirt driveway.

Looming before him...

A HOUSE right on the lake.  Tall, wooden, in disrepair.

Chipping yellow paint.  A ghost of what it once was.  The

house from the photograph.

INT. STUDY - HOUSE

The CLANG of electric typewriter keys bang out a title:

BLINK OF AN EYE, by Walter By

WALTER BYRD hunched at his typewriter.  In an old study.

Books stacked everywhere.  Light patches on the walls where

pictures used to hang.

BARKING outside.  Walter cocks his head.  Gets up.  Walks

over to the window.

OUTSIDE.  Will walking up to the house.  Lucy and Desi

jumping around him.

INT. LIVING ROOM - SUMMER HOUSE

Will opens the screen door with a CREAK.  Steps into the

living room.

Recoils from the smell.  Flies BUZZING.  Yellow plastic

covering the sofas.  Boxes, books, papers, pictures piled

high everywhere.  Wallpaper faded, peeling.

Everything, decaying.

INT./EXT. ELLIE'S TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

Ellie ripping along the forest road in her truck.  Gripping

the wheel.  The photograph pieces, taped together on the

passenger seat.

INT. SUMMER HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Will heads down a hallway.  Dark, narrow, floorboards worn.

More shit stacked up.

Each step, careful, quiet.  Tracking.  Listening.  A BREEZE

sweeps through.  The burned-out lightbulb hanging from the

ceiling, starts swinging.

Will whips around.

WALTER standing there.  At the other end of the hallway.

Shoulders slumped.

Will shakes his head.

FLIES, bouncing against the screen door.

Walter looks around.

Walter looks at him.

Will takes a step forward...

Slowly reaches into his jacket...

Pulls out his SMITH AND WESSON.  Walter.  Looks at the gun.

Inches back.

SUDDENLY, darts out of sight.  Swings back into the doorway

with a SHOTGUN...

BAM!  Will's shoulder explodes with blood.

EXT. DRIVEWAY - SUMMER HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Ellie, jumping out of her truck.  Hears the sound.  Looks up

at the big, yellow house.  Pulls out her Glock 40.

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Walter walking down the hall.  Will, writhing on the floor,

reaches for his back holster...gun's not there!

Walter stands over him.  Swings his leg back and...CRACK!

Kicks will in the ribs.  The pain, blinding.  Will GASPS.

CRACK! again, CRACK! again, CRACK! again.  Walter's face.

Calm, flushed.  A vein along his temple.

Will's eyes flutter.  Blood, spewing from his lips.  A THUD!

to his kidneys.  Walter stops, out of breath.  Hand on hip.

WILL'S HAND suddenly shoots out.  Grabs the shotgun barrel.

WALTER stumbles back.  The shotgun goes off.  BAM!  Chunks of

ceiling rain down.  Walter falls to the ground.

EXT. SUMMER HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Ellie, heart POUNDING.  Kicks the front door open...

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Will, covered in dry wall, struggling to his feet.  Reaches

for his Smith and Wesson.

WALTER'S DESERT BOOT kicks it out of the way.  It SKITTERS

down the hall.

Walter grabs his shotgun.  Scrambles to his feet.  Runs down

to the end of the hall.  Ducks into...

INT. LIBRARY

...the library.  Dirty shelves, strings of dust.  Endless

books.  He races over to a cabinet.  Yanks open a DRAWER...

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Will, on his feet, trying to focus.  His suit, soaked with

blood.  Looking for his gun.  Spots it, in the corner...

INT. LIBRARY

Walter jerks open another drawer.  A STACK OF BOOKS teeter on

the top of the cabinet.  He finds what he needs.  SHELLS.

Grabs a handful...

THE BOOKS tumble down on top of him.  He CRIES out, covering

his head...touches his ear, panics - hearing aid's gone!

Looks up.  Will, coming down the hall...

INT. HALLWAY

Will hobbles into the library.  Sweeps the room with this gun.

No Walter.

Steps on something, crushing it.  Looks down.  Walter's

hearing aid.  Kicks it aside.

INT. FRONT HALL - CONTINUOUS

Ellie.  In the front hall.  Following procedure.  Right hand

gripping the gun.  Left supporting the butt.

Blinks away sweat.  Facing three doorways.

INT. DINING ROOM

Will limps into the dining room.  Furniture stacked high.

Eyes, darting.  Gun, covering.  Trying to stay conscious...

BANG!  The screen door.

INT. FRONT HALL - CONTINUOUS

Ellie.  Gun swinging.  Doorway one.  Doorway two.  Doorway

three...SUDDENLY

A FIGURE

runs past number one.  Big.  Shadowy.  The flash of a GUN.

She wheels toward it.  Finger on the trigger...

SLO-MO...The FIGURE, passing.  Her heart, POUNDING.  Her

finger...squeezing...

Will Dormer or Walter Byrd?

At the last second, she jerks the gun away.  The figure

disappears.  She swallows.  Gripping the gun.  Follows.

EXT. BACK YARD - SUMMER HOUSE

The sky, heavy with clouds.  The air, foreboding.  Will

steals out the screen door.  Gun cocked.  Eyes scanning.

Wind, bending the weeds, the trees.

BAM! a shot.  Out of nowhere.  Rips into his thigh.  Will

CRIES out.  BAM! a second shot.  Whizzes past him...

INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

...CRACK! the shot bites into the window frame.  Wings Ellie

halfway across the room.  She drops to the floor.  Clutching

her shoulder.  Flesh wound.

Pulls herself over to a SIDEBOARD for cover.  Shrinks behind

it.  Notices

A PLASTIC BAG sticking out from one of the drawers.  Nudges

it open.  A flowered dress, some panty-hose, strands of long

dark hair...

EXT. BACK YARD - SUMMER HOUSE

Will.  On the ground.  Gripping his leg.  Looking wildly

around.  No sign of Walter.  Then.  He sees it.

Lucy and Desi.  Down by the boathouse.

INT. BOATHOUSE

The boathouse.  Old, rotted wood.  Crumbling beams.

Walter stands at a window.  Re-loading his shotgun.  He

fumbles, drops a shell.  It rolls towards a crack in the

floor.  Falls into the LAKE WATER below.

CLICK!  Walter levels the shotgun out the window.

WALTER'S POV - the long, undulating WEEDS outside.

EXT. WEEDS

Will.  Pulling himself through the weeds.  Losing blood fast.

Dragging his body.  Approaches the side of the BOATHOUSE.

WALTER'S GUN BARREL, sticking out.

Will ducks his head.  Winces in pain.  Breathing, becoming

ragged.  Rounds to the other side.  Hoists himself up to

another WINDOW.  Cautiously looks in...

WALTER at the far window.

Will jerks back.  Steps on the dock.  A plank CREAKS.  Shit.

Peers back through the window.

WALTER.  Still looking out.  Didn't hear a thing.

Will remembers.  Walter doesn't have his hearing aid.  He's

deaf on that side.

INT. BOATHOUSE

Walter, looking out the window.

OVER HIS SHOULDER - we see Will climbing in through the

window.  Smearing blood along the sill, favoring his leg.

Stands straight.  Levels his gun at Walter's back.

Nothing.  Walter continues staring out the window.  Will

raises his voice.

Walter jumps, whips around.  Comes face to face with the

barrel of Will Dormer's gun.  Surprised.  Absently touches

his deaf ear.

Walter looks at Will's 45.

The men LOCK EYES.  Wind HOWLING through the boathouse.

Killer and Detective.  Only a bullet separating them.

WALTER suddenly jerks up his shotgun...

BANG!  He stumbles back.  Hit in the gut.

Will's Smith and Wesson, smoking.  No longer jammed.

Walter, touches the blood.  Looks back at Will.  Staggering.

CRACK!  The rotting floor gives way beneath him.  He CRIES

out, falls.  Drops into the icy water below.

SILENCE.  Will steps over to the hole.  Looks down at

WALTER, floating on his back.  Looking up at him.  Water

washing over his body.  Eyes, pleading.  Fading.  A wave,

gently pulls him away.

EXT. BOATHOUSE

Will staggers out on to the dock.  Drops his gun.  Crashes to

his knees.  Falls back.  His face, pale.  Lying against the

wood of the dock.

RAIN DROPS.  Start to fall.  Washing the blood from his skin.

Puckering the lake water.  Will's eyes...flutter...

FOOTSTEPS...running along the dock.  Heavy boots...

Will squints against the rain.  Makes out the face of

ELLIE hovering over him.  He gives a half-smile.

Ellie kneels down next to him.  Pulls over her vest.  Covers

him.

Will looks at her bloody shoulder.

Ellie, tearing off her boot.  Yanks off her sock.

Will, fading fast.

Ellie, wraps the sock around his leg.  Starts twisting.  Will

grimaces.  Ellie swallows.  Doesn't want to ask this.

Will nods.

A pained looks crosses Ellie's face.

Will shakes his head.

RAIN, drumming down around them.  Will, takes a deep breath.

His blood, pumping out in rivulets.  Ellie looks down at him.

Her hero.  Moves up to the wound in his arm.

Will reaches up a feeble hand.  Stops her.

His eyelids, growing heavy.

Ellie blinks away the tears.  Knows what he means.  What he

wants.  Watches as the calm spreads over him.

Will closes his eyes.

Will opens his eyes.  She ties the second sock around his

arm.

She gets up.  Slips her arms under his shoulders.  Starts

hoisting him up.

Will.  Struggling to his knees.  Every inch of him, screaming

in pain.  Gets to his feet.  Arm slung around this tiny,

young woman.

And they head, slowly but surely, back down the dock.
