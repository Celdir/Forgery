fifties. They begin to walk down the aisle of the funeral

parlor.

receiving condolences. The Two Men approach her. The First

Man (the recipient of the money) speaks:

between Galvin and the widow.

extricating Galvin from the commotion.

a while in the cold, snowy night. He stops for a stoplight

at a corner, waits for the light although there is no traffic.

The seedy, disorganized small office, Galvin in shirt-sleeves

opening a file cabinet. He takes out an armload of files,

carries them to a wastebasket and throws them in. He sits on

his desk, as if exhausted by his effort, pours from a whiskey

bottle into a large water glass, downs the glass.

He has been drinking for some time. He starts stumbling back

to the file cabinet. On the way his eye is caught by his

degrees hanging on the wall. He stumbles to them, picks them

up and walks over to the wastebasket and throws them in. He

goes back to the file cabinet, the phone starts ringing.

Galvin lets it ring, continues emptying the files into the

wastebasket, tearing some of them up as he does so.

He repeats softly to himself, as a litany, "It doesn't make

a bit of difference, it doesn't make a bit of difference..."

He starts back to the desk for the bottle, knocks the still-

ringing phone off the desk. He pours himself a drink.

As he downs it we hear -- softly -- from the phone on the

floor: a MAN'S VOICE. "Frank. Frank. Frank. Goddamnit. Are

you there...? Frank..." Galvin pays no attention.

Drinks his drink and gazes at the wall -- now empty of

degrees.
