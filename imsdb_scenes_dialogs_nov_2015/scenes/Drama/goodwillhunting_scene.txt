FADE IN:

EXT. SOUTH BOSTON ST. PATRICK'S DAY PARADE -- DAY

INT. L STREET BAR & GRILLE, SOUTH BOSTON -- EVENING

The bar is dirty, more than a little run down. If there is

ever a cook on duty, he's not here now. As we pan across

several empty tables, we can almost smell the odor of last

nights beer and crushed pretzels on the floor.

As the camera rises, we find FOUR YOUNG MEN seated around a

table near the back of the bar.

The guy holding court is CHUCKIE SULLIVAN, 20, and the largest

of the bunch. He is loud, boisterous, a born entertainer.

Next to him is WILL HUNTING, 20, handsome and confident, a

softspoken leader. On Will's right sits BILLY MCBRIDE, 22,

heavy, quiet, someone you definitely wouldn't want to tangle

with.

Finally there is MORGAN O'MALLY, 19, smaller than the other

guys. Wiry and anxious, Morgan listens to Chuckie's horror

stories with eager disgust.

All four boys speak with thick Boston accents. This is a

rough, working class Irish neighborhood and these boys are

its product.

Chuckie is really laughing now.

Morgan gives Will a look, but Will only smiles.

The opening credits roll over a series of shots of the city

and the real people who live and work there, going about

their daily lives.

We see a panoramic view of South Boston.

Will sits in his apartment, walls completely bare. A bed, a

small night table and an empty basket adorn the room. A stack

of twenty or so LIBRARY BOOKS sit by his bed. He is flipping

through a book at about a page a second.

Chuckie stands on the porch to Will's house. His Cadillac

idles by the curb. Will comes out and they get in the car.

We travel across crowded public housing and onto downtown.

Finally, we gaze across the river and onto the great

cementdomed buildings that make up the M.I.T. campus.

INT. M.I.T. CLASSROOM -- DAY

The classroom is packed with graduate students and TOM.

PROFESSOR LAMBEAU (52) is at the lectern. The chalkboard

behind him is covered with theorems.

Many of you probably had this as undergraduates in real

analysis. It won't hurt to brush up. I am also putting an

advanced fourier system on the main hallway chalkboard--

Everyone groans.

Prof. Lambeau holds up a thin publication entitled "M.I.T.

Tech." Everyone laughs.

More laughs.

A smattering of applause. Students pack their bags.

INT. FUNLAND  LATER

The place is a monster indoor funpark. Will, Chuckie, Morgan,

and Billy are in adjoining batting cages. Will has disabled

the pitching machine in his and pitches to Chuckie. The boys

have been drinking. Will throws one to Chuckie, high and

tight.

Several empty beer cans sit by the cage.

Another pitch, inside.

Will guns another one, way inside.

Chuckie laughs and steps back.

Will fires a pitch at Chuckie's head. Chuckie dives to avoid

being hit. He gets up and whips his batting helmet at Will.

EXT. SOUTH BOSTON ROOFTOP -- EARLY AFTERNOON

SEAN McGUIRE (52) sits, FORMALLY DRESSED, on the roof of his

apartment building in a beat-up lawn chair. Well-built and

fairly muscular, he stares blankly out over the city.

On his lap rests an open invitation that reads "M.I.T. CLASS

OF '67 REUNION."

While the morning is quiet and Sean sits serenely, there is

a look about his that tells us he has faced hard times. This

is a man who fought his way through life. On his lonely stare

we:

EXT. M.I.T. CAMPUS LAWN -- DAY

A thirty year REUNION PARTY has taken over the lawn. A well

dressed throng mill about underneath a large banner that

reads "WELCOME BACK CLASS OF '72." We find Professor Lambeau

standing with a drink in his hand, surveying the crowd. He

is interrupted by an approaching STUDENT.

EXT. TOM FOLEY PARK, S. BOSTON -- AFTERNOON

In the bleachers of the visiting section we find our boys,

drinking and smoking cigarettes. Will pops open a beer. The

boys have been here a while and it shows.

Billy sees something that catches his interest.

Their P.O.V. reveals a girl in stretch pants talking to a

beefy looking ITALIAN GUY (BOBBY CHAMPA)

The boys get up and walk down the bleachers.

INT. M.I.T. HALLWAY -- LATER

Lambeau, still in his reunion formal-wear, strides down the

hallway, carrying some papers. A group of students have

gathered by the chalkboard. They part like the red sea as he

approaches the board. Using the papers in hand, he checks

the proof.

Satisfied, he turns to the class.

Dead silence. Lambeau turns to an INDIAN STUDENT.

Nemesh shakes his head in awe.

Lambeau erases the proof and starts putting up a new one.

INT. CHUCKIE'S CAR, DRIVING IN SOUTH BOSTON -- CONTINUOUS

The street is crowded as our boys drive down Broadway. They

move slowly through heavy traffic, windows down. Chuckie

sorts through a large "KELLY'S ROAST BEEF" BAG as he drives.

Will holds the wheel for Chuckie as he looks through the

bag.

Chuckie gets out fries for himself, hands Will his fries.

Laughter, Chuckie goes back searching through the bag.

Chuckie whips a FISH SANDWICH back to Morgan, then to Billy.

Push in on Will who sees something O.S.

Will's P.O.V. reveals BOBBY CHAMPA and his friends walking

down the street. One of them casually lobs a bottle into a

wire garbage can. It SHATTERS and some of the glass hits a

FEMALE PASSERBY who, although unhurt, is upset.

Will's P.O.V.: The woman says something to Bobby. He says

something back. By the look on her face, it was something

unpleasant.

Will is out of the door, jogging toward Bobby Champa. Billy

gets out, following Will with a look of casual indifference.

Leaving the car, Chuckie opens his door to follow.

And with that, Chuckie is out the door.

EXT. SIDEWALK --CONTINUOUS

Will comes jogging up towards BOBBY CHAMPA, calling out from

across the street,

Bobby is bewildered by this strange interruption and unsure

of Will's intentions. Just when it looks as though Bobby

might remember him, Will DRILLS HIM with a sucker-punch which

begins the

FIGHT SEQUENCE: 40 FRAMES OVER M. GAYE'S "LET'S GET IT ON."

Will's momentum and respectable strength serve to knock the

hapless Champa out cold.

As soon as Will hits Bobby, his friends CONVERGE ON WILL.

Billy JUMPS IN and wrestles one guy to the ground. The two

exchange messy punches on the sidewalk.

Will is in trouble, back pedaling, dodging punches, trying

to avoid being overrun.

When Will goes for one guy, another has an open shot and he

HAMMERS WILL with a right hand to the head.

Will is staggered and bleary, as a second guy winds up for a

shot he is BLIND SIDED by Chuckie who hits the kid like he

was a tackling sled, lifting him off the ground.

Chuckie turns to see Will still outnumbered. It's all Will

can do to stay standing as Morgan DROP KICKS one of Champa's

boys from the hood of a car.

Contrary to what we might think, Morgan is actually quite a

fighter. He peppers the kid with a flurry of blows.

The fight is messy, ugly and chaotic. Most punches are thrown

wildly and miss, heads are banged against concrete, someone

throws a bottle.

In the end, it's our guys who are left standing, while Bobby's

friends stagger off. Chuckie and Morgan turn to see Will,

standing over the unconscious Bobby Champa, still POUNDING

him.

ANGLE ON WILL: SAVAGE, UGLY, VICIOUS, AND VIOLENT

Whatever demons must be raging inside Will, he is taking

them out on Bobby Champa. He pummels the helpless, unconscious

Champa, fury in his eyes. Chuckie and Billy pull Will away.

The POLICE finally arrive on the scene and having only

witnessed Will's vicious attack on Champa, they grab him.

EXT. SIDEWALK (FULL SPEED) -- CONTINUOUS

A crowd of onlookers have gathered. Chuckie addresses them.

The Police slam Will into the hood of a car.

The cop holding Will SLAMS his [Will's] face into the hood,

another cop uses a baton to press Will's face into the car.

The look of rage returns to Will's eye.

Will resists. Another cop comes over. Will KICKS HIM IN THE

KNEE, dropping the cop. Momentarily freed, Will engages in a

fracas with three cops. More converge on Will, who -- though

he struggles -- takes a beating.

EXT. SEAN'S ROOF -- NIGHT

Sean sits, exactly as we first saw him, except his tie is

now loose and an empty bottle of BUSHMILLS is at his side.

He stares out over the City. A MATRONLY LANDLADY comes out

of a doorway on the roof.

Sean doesn't answer.

A beat.

After a moment, she retreats back down the stairs. Sean

doesn't move.

EXT. CHARLES RIVER, ESTABLISHING SHOT -- MORNING

The morning sun reflects brilliantly off the river.

EXT. COURTHOUSE -- NEXT MORNING

Will emerges from the courthouse. Chuckie is waiting for him

in the Cadillac with two cups of DUNKIN' DOUGHNUTS coffee.

He hands one of them to Will. This feels routine.

Chuckie pulls away.

EXT. M.I.T. CAMPUS, ESTABLISHING SHOT -- MORNING

Students walk to class, carrying bags. More than any other,

students seem to be heading into one PARTICULAR CLASSROOM.

INT. M.I.T. CLASSROOM -- MORNING

The classroom is even more crowded than last we saw it. Tom

takes notes as Lambeau plays along with the excited

environment with mock pomposity and good humor.

Laughter.

More laughter.

He holds up the M.I.T. Tech featuring a silhouetted figure,

emblazoned with a large, white question mark. The headline

reads "Mystery Math Magician strikes again."

The class waits in breathless anticipation. A STUDENT shifts

his weight in his chair, making a noise.

People start to gather their things and go. Lambeau picks up

a piece of chalk and starts writing on the board.

OMITTED

INT. M.I.T. HALLWAY -- NIGHT

Lambeau comes out of his office with Tom and locks the door.

As he turns to walk down the hallway, he stops. A faint

TICKING SOUND can be heard. He turns and walks down the hall.

Lambeau and Tom come around a corner. His P.O.V. reveals a

figure in silhouette blazing through the proof on the

chalkboard. There is a mop and a bucket beside him. As Lambeau

draws closer, reveal that the figure is Will, in his janitor's

uniform. There is a look of intense concentration in his

eyes.

Will looks up, immediately starts to shuffle off.

Lambeau follows Will down the hall.

Will walks out. Lambeau goes to "fix" the proof, scanning

the blackboard for whatever damage Will caused. He stops,

scans the board again. Amazement registers on his face.

Down the hall, we hear the DOOR CLOSE. He turns to look for

Will, who is gone.

EXT. BOW AND ARROW PUB, CAMBRIDGE -- THAT NIGHT

A crowded Harvard Bar. Will and our gang walk by a line of

several Harvard students, waiting to be carded.

Laughter.

After two students flash their ID's to the doorman (CASEY)

our boys file past him.

With an imperceptible nod, Casey waves our boys through. A

fifth kid, a HARVARD STUDENT, tries to follow. He is stopped

by Casey's massive, outstretched arm:

INT. BOW AND ARROW -- CONTINUOUS

Chuckie is collecting money from the guys to buy a pitcher,

all but Morgan cough up some crumpled dollars.

INT. BACK SECTION, BOW AND ARROW -- MOMENTS LATER

Chuckie returns to a table where Will, Morgan and Billy have

made themselves comfortable. He [Chuckie] spots two ATTRACTIVE

YOUNG HARVARD WOMEN sitting together at the end of the bar.

Chuckie struts his way toward the women and pulls up a chair.

He flashes a smile and tries to submerge his thick Boston

accent.

At this point, several interested parties materialize. Morgan

Billy and Will try, as inconspicuously as possible, to situate

themselves within listening distance. A rather large student

in a HARVARD LACROSSE sweatshirt, CLARK (22) notices Chuckie.

He [Clark] walks over to Skylar and Lydia, nobly hovering

over them as protector. This gets Will, Morgan, and Billy's

attention.

At this point, Clark can't resist and steps in.

Chuckie nods. Clark notices Chuckie's clothes. Will and Billy

exchange a look and move subtly closer.

Billy shifts his beer into his left hand. Will and Morgan

see this. Morgan rolls his eyes as if to say "not again..."

Clark looks to see if the girls are impressed. They are not.

When Clark looks back to Chuckie, Skylar turns to Lydia and

rolls her [own] eyes. They laugh. Will sees this and smiles.

Will and Billy come forward, stand behind Chuckie.

Will, who at this point has migrated to Chuckie's side and

is completely fed-up, includes himself in the conversation.

Clark is stunned.

Clark is lost now, searching for a graceful exit, any exit.

Will catches Skylar's eye.

While Will is substantially smaller than Clark, he [Clark]

decides not to take Will up on his [Will's] offer.

He turns and walks away. Chuckie follows, throwing Clark a

look.

Morgan turns to a nearby girl.

INT. BOW AND ARROW, AT THE BAR -- LATER

Will sits with Morgan at the bar watching with some amusement

as Chuckie and Billy play bar basketball game where the

players shoot miniature balls at a small basket. In the B.G.

occasionally we hear Chuckie shouting "Larry!" When he scores.

Skylar emerges from the crowd and approaches Will.

Skylar produces a folded piece of paper and offers it to

Will.

She turns.

A beat.

EXT. BOW AND ARROW -- LATER

Our boys are walking out of the bar teasing one another about

their bar-ball exploits. Across the street is another bar

with a glass front. Morgan spots Clark sitting by the window

with some friends.

Will crosses the street and approaches the plate glass window

and stands across from Clark, separated only by the glass.

He POUNDS THE GLASS to get Clark's attention.

Clark turns toward Will.

Clark doesn't get it.

Will SLAMS SKYLAR'S PHONE NUMBER against the glass.

Will's boys erupt into laughter. Angle on Clark, deflated.

EXT. STREET -- NIGHT

The boys make their way home, piled into Chuckie's car,

laughing together.

EXT. CHARLES STREET BRIDGE -- DAWN

Shot of car crossing over the Charles St. Bridge, overtaking

a red-line train.

Traveling through narrow back roads in Charlestown, passing

the Bunker Hill monument.

EXT. WILL'S APARTMENT -- DAY

Arriving at Will's house and dropping him off.

INT. M.I.T. BUILDING AND GROUNDS GARAGE -- DAY

Lambeau walks into a small garage facility. The area stores

lawn machinery and various tools. An older man, TERRY (58)

sits behind the desk reading the BOSTON HERALD sports page.

Lambeau has obviously never been here before. He takes in

the surroundings, somewhat uncomfortable. Gets dirty.

Terry checks a list behind his [own] desk. Looks up.

Terry takes a beat. Holding all the cards.

Terry goes through a stack of paper on his desk. Takes out a

card and hands it to Lambeau. Lambeau looks blankly at the

card which reads: "PAROLE EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM."

INT. COURTROOM -- DAY

Will stands before JUDGE MALONE (40) being arraigned. It is

fairly unceremonious, the courtroom nearly empty, save Will

and the PROSECUTOR. Lambeau walks in from the back.

The Judge interrupts to address the prosecutor.

Will cranks it up.

The Judge interrupts.

The Judge opens Will's CASE HISTORY.

A beat, the Judge takes particular notice.

Lambeau has to smile, impressed. The Judge shakes his head.

The Judge takes a beat. Gives Will a look.

The Judge holds a look to Will, who looks down.

The Bailiff goes to remove Will from the courtroom.

As Will is removed from the courtroom, Lambeau approaches

Judge Malone who is stepping down from the bench.

An awkward beat. Lambeau waits for some sign of recognition.

The Judge offers only a blank look.

INT. MIDDLESEX COUNTY JAIL, HOLDING AREA -- SAME

A GUARD walks Will down a hallway toward a group of phones.

The Guard gives Will a hard look for a beat. Then leaves.

Will picks up the phone, dials.

INT. SKYLAR'S DORM -- DAY

INT. MIDDLESEX COUNTY JAIL, INTERROGATION ROOM -- LATER

Professor Lambeau sits, waiting. Will is brought in, shackled,

by the guard.

INT. FUNLAND -- DAY

Will and Chuckie walk up to an enclosed trampoline. Billy

and Morgan prefer to use it for their own version of

"Wrestlemania."

As Will and Chuckie approach, Billy is on top of a bloodied

Morgan and has him in the "Cobra Clutch."  Will and Chuckie

watch for a beat. Billy tightens his grip.

Chuckie turns to Will, conspiratorially as they wait for the

fight to finish.

Will smiles.

INT. WILL'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

Will sits alone in his one room apartment, reading. A closer

look reveals he is reading a self-help PSYCHOLOGY BOOK. Will

is flipping through the book at about a page per second. He

shakes his head and smiles. Upon finishing the book, he throws

it in a nearby WASTEBASKET. Push in on the back of the book

where a SMILING PSYCHOLOGIST is pictured.

INT. PSYCHOLOGIST'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS

Will sits in a well decorated Psychologist's Office. Across

from Will sits the same PSYCHOLOGIST, HENRY LIPKIN (40),

from the book. They are in mid-session.

Will gives the Psychologist a furtive look.

The Psychologist calmly packs his things.

The shrink gets up and walks out.

INT. HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS

The Psychologist comes walking out, much to the surprise of

Lambeau and Tom who have been waiting in the lobby.

The Psychologist keeps walking.

He [Henry] is out the door. Lambeau looks to Tom.

INT. LAMBEAU'S OFFICE -- DAY

Will is in Lambeau's office. Lambeau is at the board, working

on a diagram as Tom takes notes. Will seems disinterested.

Lambeau smiles.

Lambeau says nothing. Will gets up and goes to the board.

Lambeau keeps smiling.

Lambeau rises and goes to the board.

He draws a vertical line through the diagram.

He draws a horizontal line through the diagram. He hands

Will the chalk.

Will realizes what Lambeau is getting at. In a flash he starts

drawing lines through the diagram, energized.

Lambeau steps in, writing with him [Will].

The two stop. They are silent for a moment. Like two

gunfighters after a duel, they put down the chalk.

Will gets his coat.

INT. LAMBEAU'S OFFICE -- DAY

Will sits in a chair across from Lambeau and the HYPNOTIST.

Lambeau's assistant, TOM (33) takes notes. The Hypnotist

makes small talk with Lambeau, who checks his watch.

He SNAPS HIS FINGERS and instantly Will's head goes BACK and

his EYES CLOSE. The Hypnotist gives Lambeau a look.

Will gets up and stands on one leg. Lambeau is impressed.

INT. LAMBEAU'S OFFICE -- LATER

Will is reclining, eyes closed, in a trance-like state. The

mood is more serious now.

Will flinches.

Lambeau makes a sound. The Hypnotist shushes him [Lambeau]

with his [Hypnotist's] finger. Tom returns to his note-taking.

Lambeau and the Therapist trade looks. This is working.

Will breaks into song at full volume.

The Hypnotist gets up and starts heading towards the door.

Will is still singing from "Sky Rockets."

He is gone. Will stops singing, laughs.

Will gets up and adopts a hypnotic persona in front of

Lambeau.

Will is out the door. Lambeau turns to Tom.

INT. BUNKER HILL CAMPUS -- DAY

This is SEAN MAGUIRE'S "Dying and Bereavement" class.

Emblazoned on the door is "room 101." While the lecture hall

could hold sixty students, there are less than fifteen here

today.

Sean Maguire lectures to the class in a resigned tone. Tired

of teaching, tired of life, he finds himself resigned to the

tedium of teaching core classes to an indifferent student

body.

A beat.

MAUREEN'S only response is an empty stare.

VINNIE looks up.

He looks around the room for approval. No one is listening.

The students look up, somewhat stunned.

Laughter. Sean starts to resume his lecture, when he notices

LAMBEAU standing in the back of the room. There is an awkward

moment.

The students stare blankly.

A beat.

The class starts to pack up and file out. Lambeau approaches

Sean who steps down from the lectern.

EXT. HARVARD SQUARE -- NIGHT

Will and Skylar on their first date. They watch a street

MAGICIAN doing tricks with a rabbit. The guy's tricks are

pretty good, but his on-stage persona could use some work.

He is incessantly repeating the phrase "this is the rabbit,

the rabbit really does the tricks." Will gives Skylar a look

and they move on.

INT. TOY STORE -- LATER

Will and Skylar walk into the small shop.

Will, pulls out a bulging HANDFUL OF CARAMELS.

Will goes into all manner of hocus-pocus theatrics. Then

shakes his hand wildly. The trick doesn't pan out and the

caramels go flying all over the store. Skylar laughs.

INT. LOCKOBER RESTAURANT -- NIGHT

Lambeau and Sean share a table at this exclusive restaurant.

Sean seems slightly out of place in his wrinkled sport coat.

INT. HARVARD SQ. DINER: "THE TASTY" -- NIGHT

A FRY COOK hands Will and Skylar a pair of CHEESEBURGERS.

Will smiles.

She laughs.

He looks at her.

Both of them have cheeseburger in their mouths.

They kiss, mouths full of burger. It's nice. A beat.

Will laughs.

She smiles.

She laughs.

INT. LOCKOBER RESTAURANT -- SAME

Lambeau and Sean, having finished their meal. Lambeau has

been pitching Sean.

Sean nods his head.

Sean finishes the joke. Lambeau chuckles.

Sean gives a slight, knowing smile.

Lambeau nods.

The waiter comes with the CHECK. Each man reaches for it.

Sean relents.

EXT. BUNKER HILL CAMPUS -- MORNING

Establishing shot of the red-brick campus. Planes land at

nearby Logan airport. Will walks up the steps.

INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

Sean's office is comfortable. Books are stacked against the

wall. There is a PAINTING on the wall behind Sean. Sean is

seated behind a desk. Lambeau sits in a chair in the back of

the room, next to Tom. A long beat passes, they wait.

Sean nods. Will walks in. Everyone stands to greet Will.

Sean and Will nod. An awkward moment as the four men stand.

Lambeau is slightly embarrassed. Sean smiles at Will's joke.

Lambeau looks at Sean, surprised. Sean's stare is unwavering.

After an awkward moment, Lambeau goes, leaving Sean and Will

alone. Will doesn't look at Sean for more than a second. He

seems more interested in the room. There is a long silence

as Sean watches Will.

A smile crosses Will's face as he walks to his chair and

sits.

He lights a cigarette. Sean continues to watch him. Finally-

Will's eyes flicker up to the shelf for an instant.

Sean says this with pride. His determined stare and confident

manner catch Will a bit off guard. Will rises from his chair

and goes to the shelf.

Will returns to his chair. Pause.

Sean does not seem at all affected by Will's attitude. He

remains behind the big desk with almost half a smile on his

face. Will is aware of Sean's confidence.

Will gets up again and moves around his chair to Sean's

painting. It is a picture of an old sailboat in a tremendous

storm -- by no means a masterpiece. Will studies it.

Sean is walking slowly towards Will.

In a flash, Sean has Will by the throat. Will is helpless.

INT. HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS

Will walks out of Sean's office past Lambeau and Tom who are

sitting in the hallway.

INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

Sean stands behind his desk in his office, still very much

on edge. Lambeau walks in.

A pause, Sean is staring at his painting.

EXT. WONDERLAND RACETRACK -- DAY

Will and Skylar sit in the stands watching the dogs run.

They ad lib teasing one another about England, Ireland, and

America.

She smiles.

Will shakes his head.

Will shakes his head. Smiles.

Skylar smiles.

INT. SEAN'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

As we pan across Sean's small apartment, we find it strewn

with dirty clothes and the sink full of dishes. Although, if

it weren't for the clutter, the place would feel pretty bare.

A framed SPORTS ILLUSTRATED cover featuring a screaming Larry

Bird and entitled "CELTIC PRIDE" hangs on the wall. Sean

sits at the table next to another nearly empty bottle of

BUSHMILL'S IRISH WHISKEY. He is deep in thought.

INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

Will strolls into the office. Sean is waiting there behind

his desk. He seems different. More calm. Will and Sean stare

at each other for a long moment.

Sean stands up.

EXT. BOSTON COMMON -- MINUTES LATER

Sean and Will sit in the bleachers at the mostly empty park.

They look out over a small pond, in which a group of

schoolchildren on a field trip ride the famous Swan Boats.

Will nods quietly.

Sean stands,

And walks away.

INT. CONSTRUCTION SITE -- DAY

Will and Chuckie doing demo at the site. They throw

cinderblocks out a window into a pile. They are filthy.

EXT. SOUTH BOSTON STREET -- NIGHT

Rain pounds South Boston. Chuckie sits with the Cadillac

fiddling, humming to the radio. Morgan and Billy sit in the

back, sharing a case of beer. Will is at a pay phone.

INT. SKYLAR'S ROOM -- NIGHT

Will hangs up and runs back to the car, soaked.

Laughter. Chuckie pulls away from the curb.

There is a long moment of silence in response to Morgan's

attempt at levity. Then laughter.

Billy WHIPS his EMPTY BEER CAN off of Morgan's head.

INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

Will sits across from Sean completely silent and takes out a

pack of cigarettes.

Will puts the cigarettes away. Sean stares at Will and

occasionally at the clock. Sean continues to check the clock

on the wall. It is the only clock in the room and it is BEHIND

Will. Their hour is almost up.

CLOSE ON: WILL'S EYES INTERCUT WITH THE CLOCK.

He is counting seconds. As the second hand crosses the twelve,

Will stands up and walks out, leaving Sean alone.

INT. HALLWAY -- LATER

Lambeau and Sean walk down the hallway after the session.

EXT. WILL'S APARTMENT -- EVENING

Chuckie drops Will off at his apartment, watches him [Will]

walk up the steps.

EXT. WILL'S APARTMENT -- MORNING

Chuckie pulls up to the curb and walks up the steps to Will's

front door. After a beat, Will emerges. They get back in

[the car].

EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE -- DAY

Will and Chuckie at work. Chuckie shows Will how to be a

man.

INT. L STREET BAR & GRILLE, SOUTH BOSTON -- NIGHT

The bar is a bit more crowded than usual. Will and Chuckie

walk back to their table, carrying beers. They pass a table

of GIRLS, local regulars getting just as bombed as the guys.

These girls are a little overdone. Too much make-up, too

much hairspray, and too much body for such tight outfits.

One of the girls, KRYSTYN, smiles at Will who seems subdued.

They pass the table of girls. Chuckie looks at one, ruefully.

Chuckie turns back to one of the girls, calling out:

A girl at the table, CATHY, holds up her PINKY FINGER and

smiles -- revealing a mouthful of MISSING TEETH.

Will nods, not really into it tonight.

They get to the table. Will's heart just isn't in it.

INT. LAMBEAU'S OFFICE -- DAY

Will and Lambeau work together at the board. They communicate

non-verbally as they collaborate on a problem. After a

particularly amusing series of numbers, they share a look

and laugh.

INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

Will and Sean sit in silence. A long moment passes. Sean

casually reclines in his chair, disinterested. Will restlessly

looks around the room and then back to Sean. An odd half

smile crosses Sean's face. After a moment:

A beat.

Sean smiles.

Will says nothing.

Sean looks directly at Will, who looks away. A beat.

Will smiles, Sean takes a beat.

Will smiles. A beat.

Sean laughs.

A beat. Sean smiles.

EXT. SKYLAR'S DORM -- AFTERNOON

Will is waiting outside the door for someone to come out --

so he can go in.

INT. SKYLAR'S DORM -- AFTERNOON

The door to Skylar's dorm is partially open. Will stands

outside while Skylar remains on the threshold.

She holds up her Lab. Will glances at it.

Will smiles.

EXT. HARVARD SQUARE -- LATER

Will sits in an outdoor cafe, thinking. After a beat, he

leans over to two students working at a nearby table, borrows

a pen and paper and starts writing.

EXT. SKYLAR'S DORM -- DAY

Will is a solitary figure strolling across the lawn. He stops

at Skylar's dorm and knocks on the door.

INT. SKYLAR'S DORM -- DAY

She emerges. He hands her the paper he was working on. It is

her O-chem lab.

With a smile, she relents.

INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

Sean and Will in session.

Will starts to clarify his question.

Sean smiles.

A beat. Will is impressed.

They laugh.

INT LAMBEAU'S OFFICE -- DAY

The office is more crowded than usual. TOM and THREE of

LAMBEAU'S COLLEAGUES including the esteemed ALEXANDER PEKEC

are in the room. Will sits at a work-station which projects

a proof of his [Will's] onto the chalkboard. Lambeau stands

beside the projected image at the board arguing with Pekec,

a foreign mathematician. The image is of a Ramses graph binary

tree.

Pekec starts writing lines beside Will's proof on the board.

Lambeau can no longer contain himself.

They turn to Will who places his proof on the projector. The

image is cast over their faces. It reads:

As Pekec reads and the realization dawns on him:

Lambeau turns with satisfaction to an understanding Pekec.

INT. SKYLAR'S ROOM -- NIGHT

Will and Skylar in her room, post coital. They are wrapped

in a sheet. Will is absent-mindedly playing the memory game

SIMON.

The pattern grows increasingly complex. After a beat:

She laughs. Stops him.

INT. L STREET BAR & GRILLE -- LATER

Skylar and Will sit together along with Will's gang. The

boys are considerably drunk, but it makes for good

entertainment.

Everyone here is having fun including Sylar.

Everyone is laughing. Skylar speaks above the din.

She has everyone's attention. Will is nervous.

C/U of Will. Hoping the joke pans out.

The gang erupts with laughter.

Chuckie, Will look at Morgan, baffled.

EXT. L STREET BAR & GRILLE -- LATER

Everyone is walking out, saying good-bye. Chuckie goes over

to Will and Skylar.

Chuckie heads towards Will to say goodnight.

Morgan mumbles something and staggers off. Billy follows

with an indifferent shrug.

He knows, once you see that shit-hole he's gettin' dropped

like a bad habit.

Chuckie gives Will a curious look.

INT. FACULTY CLUB -- NIGHT

A cocktail party is underway. Professors mingle with

representatives from high tech companies. Lambeau stands

holding a drink and surrounded by several RECRUITERS.

Apparently he's the star of the show.

Laughter.

More laughter.

He walks off.

INT. TIMMY'S TAP -- DAY

Timmy's Tap is a local watering hole, not unlike the L Street

Bar. Sean is at the bar, telling a joke to TIMMY (45) the

owner of the place, and several other REGULARS.

The men erupt in laughter. MARTY, one of the regulars pipe

up.

Timmy and Sean exchange a look.

Lambeau enters, a bit overdressed in his sport coat and tie.

Sean heads towards a table.

Lambeau follows [Sean]. They sit.

There is an awkward moment.

Beat.

A beat.

A beat. Lambeau gets up.

INT. TRI-TECH LABORATORIES, OFFICE -- SAME

Three well dressed TRI-TECH EXECUTIVES sit around a conference

table, which is littered with promotional brochures. The

executives exchange a confused look. One of them speaks.

Cut to reveal: Chuckie sitting across from the executives,

hair combed down, wearing his Sunday best.

Chuckie rubs the tips of his fingers together, indicating

"cash." The executives are baffled.

The executives are completely blank.

Chuckie puts his hands up, as if getting a vibe from the

room.

Chuckie points to the third executive.

The third executive is baffled.

The executives exchange looks and go for their wallets.

Chuckie stands up and takes the money.

Will and Skylar sit in the open courtyard of this Harvard

Square eatery. Skylar is working on another O-chem lab. Will

sits across from her, slightly bored watching her work.

A beat. Will nods. She looks down, then up.

Will laughs.

Skylar is awestruck with admiration for Will, the Robot-pimp.

So much so that Skylar has to kiss him, then push him away.

Will freezes. A beat.

INT. CHUCKIE'S APARTMENT -- DAY

Chuckie sits on his couch, watching cartoons in his boxers

and a tee-shirt, eating cereal. The doorbell rings. He sits.

An awkward beat.

Chuckie smiles.

Chuckie nods and is about to respond when he is interrupted

by a nagging shriek from his mom.

She laughs.

Will gets up to leave.

Will turns around reveling that he's lit the PROOF ON FIRE.

Will drops it on the floor. Lambeau drops to his knees and

puts it out. He looks up at Will.

Lambeau gathers his composure and calmly walks over to the

wrinkled proof. He picks it up, smooths it out.

INT. SKYLAR'S ROOM -- NIGHT

Will and Skylar lie in bed. Skylar watches Will sleep. She

gets up and goes to the fridge. Returning to the bed:

Will lifts his shirt, revealing a six inch SCAR on his torso.

He walks out.

EXT. SKYLAR'S DORM -- NIGHT

Will leaves pulling on his clothes.

INT. NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY, OFFICE -- DAY

INT. CHUCKIE'S HOUSE -- DAY

Chuckie, Billy, and Will sit in the Sullivan kitchen. Billy

cracks open a beer and Chuckie reads the sports page. Both

boys are smoking. Will drinks a beer, distractedly. We hear

the faint music track and soft moans of a PORNO MOVIE

emanating from a back room. After a beat, Chuckie looks up.

After a beat, Morgan comes out of the back room, red-faced.

Will pays no attention to this exchange

A beat. Will has obviously been stewing on this.

A beat.

Sean waits.

A beat. Will says nothing.

A beat.

Will is silent.

Sean gets up, goes to the door and opens it.

Will loses it, slams the door shut.

Sean has finally gotten to Will.

Sean lets this play out. Possible "shepard" change.

A beat. Will looks up.

Sean goes to the door and opens it. Will walks out.

INT. MAGGIORE BUILDER'S CONSTRUCTION SITE -- DAY

Will and Chuckie take crowbars to a wall. This is what they

do for a living. As they routinely hammer away, Will becomes

more involved in his battle with the wall. Plaster and lathing

fly as Will vents his rage. Chuckie, noticing, stops working

and takes a step back, watching Will. Will is oblivious.

INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

Lambeau and Tom are in his office. Will is nowhere to be

seen.

Lambeau is on the phone.

He hangs up. Tom picks up a FORM up off the desk.

A blank look.

Will walks out carrying a brown bag. He is filthy, having

just knocked off work.

EXT. MAGGIORE BUILDER'S CONSTRUCTION SITE -- PARKING LOT

Chuckie is sitting on the hood of his Cadillac, watching

Will across the street. Chuckie is covered in grime as well.

Will starts walking towards Chuckie. As he draws closer, he

heaves a can of Budweiser a good thirty yards, to Chuckie

who handles it routinely.

Will takes a seat next to Chuckie and they crack open their

beers. Other workers file out of the site. They drink.

This gets a small laugh from Will.

A passing SHEET METAL WORKER overhears this.

A beat.

INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

Lambeau stands across from Sean, seething.

A beat. Lambeau turns, something catches his eye. Sean turns

to look, IT'S WILL. He is standing in the doorway.

There is an awkward moment as Lambeau gets his coat and

leaves.

Sean smiles. A beat. Will sees a FILE on Sean's desk.

Sean smiles.

INT. WILL'S CHILDHOOD APARTMENT -- FLASHBACK

A large, callused hand sets down a wrench next to a stick.

INT. SEAN'S OFFICE -- DAY

A long quiet moment.

Will, who had been looking away, loos at Sean.

Sean takes Will in his arms and holds him like a child. Will

sobs like a baby. After a moment, he wraps his arms around

Sean and holds him, even tighter. We pull back from this

image. Two lonely souls being father and son together.

"You gonna start?" "You gonna pay my hospital bills?"

Will comes back from the bathroom.

Billy walks in the door and give Chuckie a look. Chuckie

turns to Will.

Laughter as the boys converge on Will. He goes willingly out

the door.

EXT. L STREET -- CONTINUOUS

As they come out the door, rather than beating Will

mercilessly, they stop. Morgan goes into his own, personal

rendition of "Danny Boy." No one joins in.

Chuckie indicates an old CHEVY NOVA, parked illegally in

front of the bar.

Laughter.

On their backs as they walk down the hall.

beat until he gets up and walks away.

OMITTED

EXT. SEAN'S APARTMENT -- EARLY EVENING

Begin final sequence.

A wide, establishing shot of Sean's apartment complex as the

sun is setting. The lights are on in one unit. A tighter

shot reveals Sean, in his apartment, packing his belongings

in cardboard boxes.

EXT. SEAN'S APARTMENT, STREET -- SAME

The camera cranes down from Sean's window and onto the street,

where we pan to reveal Will, sitting in his car and looking

up at Sean as he packs his things. Will's car is packed full

of clothes and books.

Chuckie and the boys drive down the street in the Cadillac.

Morgan and Billy ride in the back, leaving the shotgun seat

waits a beat, looks in the window. An incredulous smile slowly

starts to form.

EXT. SEAN'S APARTMENT -- SAME

Sean opens the card Will left for him. It reads:

EXT. WILL'S APARTMENT -- SAME

Chuckie walks back towards his car unable to contain the

broad smile. He knows Will is gone. He shrugs in explanation

to the guys. Morgan takes Will's seat as they pull away from

the curb.

EXT. SEAN'S APARTMENT -- SAME

We pan up from the letter to Sean. A broad smile comes over

him.

This is a look we haven't seen. Sean is truly happy.

Will is on the road, driving away. As we pull back and credits

roll, the car disappears into the horizon.
