EXT. MIAMI STREET - MOVEMENT - NIGHT (1964)

in the dark. Coming toward us. Up and down in sync to an

INSTRUMENTAL LEAD-IN from somewhere. A slip of light. A

glimpse of somebody in shadow under a sweatshirt hood,

staring at us, in and out of the dark as...

INT. THE STAGE, HAMPTON HOUSE CLUB - EMPTY FRAME - NIGHT

A man walks into the shot, grabs a microphone, slips out of

his jacket and looks at us. He wants to tell us something.

He's in a lavender light. This is SAM COOKE. What he calls

out...a throaty mixture of gospel, soul and sex...is "Let me

hear it!" And WOMEN SHRIEK. He says, "Yeah!" They answer,

shrieking, "Oh, yeah!"...

EXT. MIAMI STREET - HOODED MAN'S FACE - NIGHT

up and down, running along a dark road in the dead of night,

passing vacant lots with debris amid trees and faded

buildings. He is CASSIUS CLAY. He runs in construction

boots. His eyes stare from under the hood. He passes the

husk of an abandoned car, a pastel storefront. We're in

Overtown, Miami's inner-city black neighborhood.

INT. THE STAGE, HAMPTON HOUSE CLUB (MIAMI) - SAM COOKE

shouts, "Don't fight it! We gonna feel it!"     The women in

the audience answer: "Gotta feel it!"

EXT. MIAMI STREET - CASSIUS - NIGHT

now runs diagonally across NW 7th INTERCUT with Cooke

shouting, "Yeah!"

EXT. MACARTHUR CAUSEWAY - CASSIUS - NIGHT

Cassius runs toward us. Off to the side in the black-

mirrored water of Biscayne Bay, leaden clouds in a black sky.

And now Sam Cooke SINGS "...because you make me wanna

mooove...!" and breaks into the first verse of "Feel It."

But we see Cassius' eyes are FOCUSED, CONCENTRATED,

ELSEWHERE. To where is this man running? Why is his

expression so distant? A WHITE LIGHT suddenly hits him from

behind. He looks over at...

WIDE FROM THE FRONT:      CASSIUS + A METRO-DADE POLICE CAR

that's slowed, clocking the suspicious, running black man.

The driver starts to pull over, to hassle Cassius. Then,

the cop riding shotgun gets a radio call. He taps the

driver's shoulder. They take off, the driver laughing.

Cassius looks after the white cops. He is neither relieved

nor angry. He's dismissive. And, instead, he sees

something else...

INT. A BOARD ROOM - GORDON DAVIDSON - DAY

and six other patrician, white business-people of Louisville

in their green baize and wood-paneled Luxo boardroom. They

speak soundlessly and patronizingly to Cassius Clay, Sr.,

seated at the foot of the table. It relates to the stack of

contracts in front of him. He is in a suit and tie, his

hair and moustache are dapper. His tie's a little loud. He

has his hands folded deferentially in front of him.

We get the impression that, if he doesn't understand what

he's being told, he's faking it. He is conforming,

delivering socially mandated deference...

FRONTAL:   CASSIUS, SR.

and BEYOND HIM, seated against the wall, is Cassius, Jr. in

sport jacket and tie. Right now he looks to his left and to

the right, and only then do we notice the entire wall he's

against is covered with pictures of thoroughbreds and studs

this Louisville Sponsoring Group owns as well. He is one

among their sporting possessions. He doesn't like it. He

looks at the back of his father listening.

EXT. MACARTHUR CAUSEWAY - CLOSER:   CASSIUS' EYES - NIGHT

back here, now, crossing through black night and over black

water of the MacArthur Causeway. We start to HEAR pop pop

pop pop pop pop POP over Sam Cooke's music, and Sam Cooke's

image SUPERIMPOSES as he segues from "Feelin'" to "Bring It

On Home." And the pop pop pop pop pop carries us into...

INT. THE FIFTH STREET GYM, (MIAMI) - SPEED BAG - DAWN

Cassius' fists fly in a reeling motion, hitting the speed

bag. But it's his eyes that arrest us...focused, concentrated.

OVER CASSIUS' SHOULDER:   BROWN SPEED BAG

is a blur. And it SLOWS and becomes a brown boxing glove

driving in a SLOWED straight line right at us like a piston.

OVER the glove, pushing the fist at us is SONNY LISTON. The

brown glove hits...

INT. RING - A BOXER (N.D. BOXER)

in a linear left jab. These punches are watched by Cassius'

eyes in the Fifth Street Gym...studiously studying Liston's

feet...straight-line movement...the jab, linear and straight

at us. But it SLAMS into the Boxer, not Cassius. Down he

goes. He's out. The referee pulls out his mouthpiece.

It's a bloody mess. Teeth have been knocked out with it, so

devastating is Sonny Liston... A distant crowd ROARS.

INT. RING - CASSIUS - NIGHT

VERY CLOSE, climbs into the crush with other contenders.

Victorious, Liston, being escorted out, passes very close to

him on purpose to say...

To Cassius, boxing is dangerous athletics, but Liston's

malevolence is straight from the street.

INT. FIFTH STREET GYM - CASSIUS' EYES

SEE...

INT. CHURCH - THE BACK OF HIS FATHER'S HEAD

working. He's painting a mural. It's the face of WHITE

JESUS with blue eyes and blonde hair. CASSIUS, SR.'S EYES

painting... EYES OF 12-YEAR-OLD CASSIUS, JR. watching white

Jesus go up on the Negro Baptist Church in Louisville become...

INT. FIFTH STREET GYM - CASSIUS' EYES

watching now...

INT. A CITY BUS - WATCHING - DAY

the back of his own head moving through a tunnel of white

faces, holding his mother's hand, passing the balloon faces

of nice white passengers, teenagers in athletic sweaters

going to high school, some children, all seated. MOVING

through to the rear of the bus where, standing, are black

women, heavyset with heavy legs, and middle-aged black men

with large, rough hands, crowded on their way to the day's

labor or domestic jobs in the back of the bus.

12-YEAR-OLD CASSIUS LOOKS

at a newspaper being refolded by one man in front of his face...

CASSIUS' POV:     LOUISVILLE COURIER:   EMMETT TILL

Published nationwide, it shows his gouged-out eye, the

barbed wire noose around his neck, the mutilation to his

face because at 14 years old he winked at a white girl in

Alabama.

CASSIUS, JR.

is frozen by the image. It will haunt him for most of his

life. The man holding the paper sees the boy's fear and

pushes the paper out at him as a rough joke. Cassius reacts.

Then, the man rises and offers his seat to Odessa. Then

someone shouts...

INT. FIFTH STREET GYM - CASSIUS

PAST him a short man in a white shirt, ANGELO DUNDEE, has

entered with a folded newspaper under his arm.

And Cassius -- elsewhere -- SLAMS the speed bag with a right

hook, and the bag becomes...

INT. THE MASJID AL ANSAR-MOSQUE - CASSIUS - DAY (MIAMI)

in black glasses, leaning against a wall.

MALCOLM X is at the podium.   Ceiling fans.   We could be in

Tripoli.

And Cassius is there in a black shirt, standing in the back.

Malcolm X sees him, nods...the casualness attests their

familiarity is close and extensive...

INT. FIFTH STREET GYM - LUMINOUS HOOP - MORNING

Whopwhopwhopwhopwhop...as first rays of golden light

illuminate the jump rope spinning effortlessly over his head

in a blur. Dust dances in light through the two dirty

windows with boxing gloves and "Fifth Street Gym" painted on

them. It's that time of day Jack Johnson called the

"fighter's hour," "...between the night and the light..."

...whopwhopwhopwhopwhop... And Angelo Dundee puts on a pot

of coffee. He washes his hands in a dirty sink, thoroughly

drying them. Alert and clean, he's old school. He goes

back to the edge of the ring, reading his newspaper. Now,

crossing past the white windows is DREW "BUNDINI" BROWN. He

takes an orange out of his pocket, sitting on a bench,

silently peels it... As Cassius "walks" the rope, jumping

up and back.

Cassius drops the rope where he stands, and walks off as Sam

Cooke...

INT. THE HAMPTON HOUSE CLUB - SAM COOKE

segues into "Bring It On Home" and women in the front row

reach out for him. The heat between Cooke and them is

palpable. The first row is going crazy as...

INT. FIFTH STREET GYM - CASSIUS

sits into our frame, glistening with sweat, directed through

tortuous calisthenics by the hands of Luis Sarria.

INT. HAMPTON HOUSE CLUB - HIGH + WIDE FRONTAL:    SAM COOKE'S

sweating.    The place is rocking as...

INT. THE RING, FIFTH STREET GYM - CASSIUS' EYES - DAY

alive, sparring. But Cassius never throws a punch... He

jerks back, sliding away, an inch away from being hit. He

circles in a movement that seems off-balance and then

becomes fluid and changes rate, faking out where you think

he'll be. His sparring partner throws a jab that misses and

follows with a hook. Cassius slips it by an inch. Entering

the gym, now, is gregarious DR. FERDIE PACHECO with a young,

afro'd HOWARD BINGHAM, who starts photographing while LUIS

SARRIA looks at us. None of the gathered crowd, the

greatest "corner" in boxing, breaks his concentration. He's

in his zone. We're in the ring. Cassius, trance-like,

hands down, circles and slips in no predictable way as...

INT. A LIMOUSINE - NOW CASSIUS IS - DAY

zenned out in SLO-MO on the way somewhere in a suit and tie.

People on the Miami streets drift by. The slow-moving limo

floats on its soft suspension through the pastel heat of

Miami. While Sam Cooke...

INT. HAMPTON HOUSE CLUB - SAM COOKE

drives to the big climax of "Bring It On Home To Me...!"

counter to the limo's EXTREME CALM as Sam Cooke's medley

ends and...

INT. A HALLWAY, THE MIAMI CONVENTION CENTER - CASSIUS - DAY

in a terry-cloth robe, walks faster and faster as Dundee and

Bundini, Bingham and his cameras, Pacheco and RUDY race to

keep up. And as Cassius slams through a door into a large

room...

INT. THE WEIGH-IN ROOM, MIAMI CONVENTION CENTER - CASSIUS - DAY

EXPLODES:

500 press, promoters and boxing people turn and stare!

LISTON a tree trunk in boxing shorts, can't wait to pull

apart this kid.

Cassius pushes past people and leaps at Sonny! He wants to

rumble right now. Bundini, Rudy, Dundee, Liston's handlers

struggle to keep them apart, wrestle Cassius onto the scale.

The man nods. Cassius gets off, is pulled aside. And

Liston gets on: unremitting stare of death at Cassius...

And Cassius goes off again...

He's restrained by Angelo and Bundini.

Handlers break it up and hustle Liston out of there.

Laughter.

A Doctor claps a cuff around Cassius' arm, taking blood

pressure.

Dundee's defensive, fast...

HOWARD COSELL is balding, tall, forties, lugging a tape

recorder.

Dundee uses that to end the conference before it strays into

"Black Muslim" territory. Meanwhile on the way out...

EXT./INT. MIAMI RENTAL HOUSE - DR. PACHECO - DAY

past guards, Bundini, press, starts to enter. Inside,

Clay's on the sofa, in his underwear, watching "The Man With

the X-Ray Eyes," who has the power to imbue and control from

beams emitted from his eyes. Dundee and Bingham hang out.

Cassius' mind is elsewhere. His eyes float to the corner of

the doorway before we see Pacheco, even though from the

outside, has started to enter...

EXT. CASSIUS' RENTAL HOUSE, BACKYARD - CORNER OF HOUSE - DAY

(MIAMI)

Nothing. Cassius is asleep in a lounge chair...incongruously

a TV is run from the house by an extension cord. Cassius

wakes. His eyes say, "Who are you?"

Drew "Bundini" Brown, early forties, holds a hat in his hand,

his eyes always seem to be glistening, ready to rage, laugh

or cry, tentatively approaches. Cassius' flat eyes return

to the television.

Cassius should kick him out, but Bundini's got his foot in

the door of Cassius' attention.

Cassius, stretched out, mumbles without looking at him...

Cassius has drifted off, back to watching TV.    What he sees

as his eyes close is:

INT. MIAMI RENTAL HOUSE - PACHECO

The blur of Pacheco taking his blood pressure.    Now Cassius

looks and his shaman, Bundini, enters.

The weigh-in episode was an act. We take a different

measure of this man. Pacheco sits next to Cassius and eats

some of his potato chips.

INT. MIAMI CONVENTION CENTER, A DRESSING ROOM - HANDS -

EARLY EVENING

being wrapped. Cassius' shirt is off, sitting on a bench in

the dressing room...the ritualistic tradition, having his

hands taped. Dundee expertly does it. In the background,

Bundini, Pacheco, Bingham, Rudy and Two Men in dark suits,

someone from Liston's camp, and a State Boxing Inspector

watch. Then, the door opens for Malcolm X, in a dark suit,

thin tie. Cassius lights up. Dundee is done. The Boxing

Inspector signs the tape. Then, Dundee puts on gloves and

laces them while...

Dundee turns away to tear two strips of tape while Cassius

and Malcolm face into a corner. Sarria throws a towel over

Cassius' shoulders. Arms bent, head down, a true believer,

he silently stands in prayer, bowing to the east with

Malcolm. During this, Dundee starts collecting his cut gear

on table.

And as he goes, leaving us, not Cassius, incomplete, Cassius

returns to Dundee, who ties gloves and puts tape over the

knot. The Inspector signs that, too.

INT. A CORRIDOR, CASSIUS - NIGHT

A door slams open. Cassius comes along the hallway, his

entourage surrounding him. Three large middle-aged white

officials accompany him, too. His face is set in stone.

White towels are draped over his head onto his shoulders.

Bundini chirps in his ear. Dundee, like a plumber, carrying

the tools of his trade...a bucket, his swabs and Vaseline.

And they seem distant to Cassius. They reach the end of the

corridor, and against the wall stand three or four older bad

cigar guys. A curtain...the sounds from the arena drift

into the hallway. Cassius is on his toes now, dancing,

dancing. And as if being drawn by a force we can't see, he

just goes...his entourage, as if holding on, carried along

by him...

INT. THE MIAMI CONVENTION CENTER - NIGHT

He comes into the hall...there are shouts, some scattered

applause, some booing, growing; and the sound moves through

the arena...the sounds of expectations, ridicule, potential

violence. But past the faces and the press, what's arrested

Cassius' attention and makes him oblivious in his solitude

to all else is the bright 20-by-20-foot place he wants to be

most in all the world: the ring.

INT. THE RING - CASSIUS - NIGHT

is struck by the brilliance. Illuminated, ready to go...

dancing...warming up. Counter to an expectation of anxiety,

Cassius can't wait to get this on. Other sounds

happen...irrelevant to him...and now the distant sound of

Liston coming into the ring...his bulked-up presence, the

roar he inspires, somewhere over there. And all of a sudden,

Cassius turns to face the angry man who wishes him death.

Cassius rocks left and right, like a tough kid on a corner

ready to rumble. The hysteria act is gone; so is the

boasting. Instead, there is only Cassius' stare. The

effect is enigmatic: what is going on here? A Referee,

like a distant bird, says something we don't hear...

In the corner, his feet float, waiting.     There's the BELL

for ROUND ONE.

INT. RING - ROUND ONE - WIDE

It starts.

LISTON

right away throws a left that misses and attacks Cassius,

throwing seven more that Cassius with extreme, awkward

caution evades.

He is fearful of the monster whose punches he has yet to

feel. Nevertheless, he does his job: measure Liston's

range and speed. Then, a body shot catches him above the

heart. Cassius feels the real power of Liston. It could

stop your heart's beating. He survives. Then...

CASSIUS

throws his long left jab. It keeps Liston at a set distance.

He has Liston's range, now, and he dances away from Liston's

charges. Then, halfway through the round, Cassius' eyes

have hunted out an opportunity, and he throws his first

combination with a few hard shots that, to Liston's surprise,

rock Liston's head back. And, then, Cassius easily evades...

LISTON'S

furious big misses to the left and right.

CASSIUS

keeps tagging Liston with his long left. And, now,

infuriates Liston even more by merely walking away from

Liston's big misses, provoking even wilder and more

inaccurate Liston assaults. (We're aware that any Liston

shot could knock out Cassius if it connected.) Then Cassius

soaks up a couple of body shots, most flicks his jab, slides,

dances, clinches, circles away...UNTIL...

AT THE END OF THE ROUND

Cassius launches a second combination, slams a couple of big

lefts Liston's way that rock his head back two times.

Liston's so furious, he flips, charging Cassius, who hits

and ducks at the same time. The BELL RINGS THREE TIMES

before they stop.

CLAY'S CORNER - CASSIUS

breathes hard.    Dundee works.   Cassius says something we

can't hear.

Angelo is talking to Clay a mile a minute, while Clay MUGS

an open mouth...to the press, ridiculing their accusation he

was all talk. It's clear he controlled Round One to

everyone's surprise.

THE BELL.    INT. RING, ROUND TWO - CASSIUS + LISTON

We see press with typewriters, ribbon, microphones, note

pads; massive TV cameras hang on platforms over two of the

corners. It's a desultory, lower-key version of Round One.

And...

BIRD'S NEST TV CAMERA + MEDIA

Coverage segues to Liston, who throws and misses a few lefts.

Cassius tags him with a few rights.

THE BELL.    CASSIUS

literally ambles into the corner.

SONNY'S CORNER:    HIS TWO TRAINERS

Liston's getting a lot of strident advice.        THE BELL.

INT. RING, ROUND THREE

LISTON'S LEFT

comes in like a freight train. Cassius merely leans away to

avoid Liston, circles and now snaps off a flurry and OPENS A

CUT UNDER SONNY'S LEFT EYE. Then, he splits out of there.

And Cassius, seizing opportunity, hits Liston with more

combinations. If Cassius won Round One, probably but not

certainly won Round Two, he now demonstrates he OWNS Round

Three. It's a symphony of classical Cassius Clay footwork,

flicked jabs that confuse, and, then, hard-hitting

combinations that rock the presumably immovable Liston. No

one told Sonny that Cassius could hit. And, at 210 pounds,

he hits HARD. Liston, angered, panicked, knows he's losing

and goes after Cassius and misses wildly as the BELL ends

Round Three...

INT. CLAY'S CORNER - CLAY

stands a moment before he sits.

EXTREMELY CLOSE:   CASSIUS CLAY

breathing heavily, ignoring the stool and Dundee and Bundini,

looks around. THIS IS WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE 22, TO BE

CASSIUS CLAY, TO BE ON TOP OF YOUR GAME AND TO BE ABOUT TO

OWN THE WORLD. He looks over the crowd. Only then, turns

and sits...

The genius of Cassius...

INT. LISTON'S CORNER - CORNERMAN

slips a vial of some medicant from his pocket and rubs it

into Liston's shoulder.

INT. RING - ROUND FOUR

The BELL RINGS. Clay peppers Liston with jabs.    Liston

pokes his left at Cassius, trying to reach him.   They feint,

circle. Liston gets his left into Cassius' face.    It's more

a poke than a shot.

CLOSE:   CASSIUS

blinks back something...we're not sure what. It seems to go

away. Then it's back. The fight continues...

WIDER:   CASSIUS

dominating. They clinch. They break. This time Cassius

violently blinks his eyes! Something's wrong!

A knife-like pain. He can't see.     He's getting beaten up.

He's in trouble. The BELL.

INT. RING, CASSIUS' CORNER - CASSIUS

sits.

Dundee feverishly washes water to get the irritant out of

Cassius' eyes.

INT. ARENA

A buzzer sounds, warning the bell's coming for Round Five.

Now Cassius stands, saying...

The BELL.    Dundee's still in the ring.

He literally pushes Cassius into the ring.

INT. RING - ROUND FIVE - LISTON

rushes Clay. He knows this is his chance. Cassius tries to

tie Liston up by holding onto the back of his neck, but

Liston pounds left and right hooks. If anybody wondered if

Clay could take punishment, this answers that. WHAM-WHAM-

WHAM-WHAM-WHAM...five huge hooks.

Liston is desperate to end it while Cassius is in trouble.

Haymaker after haymaker; some connect, others are blocked

but knock Clay sideways. Clay, still blind, keeps backing

and dancing.

CLOSER:   CASSIUS' EYES

With a minute left, now, he sees better. Liston throws him

into a corner, still trying to put him away. But, he can't,

and Liston's energy seems to deflate once he knows that.

The BELL.

INT. RING, CASSIUS' CORNER - CASSIUS'

eyes are clear.   In 60 seconds he recovers his energy.    He's

ready. BELL.

INT. RING - ROUND SIX - CASSIUS

can't wait to get out. He shuffles. He circles. He fires

combinations. In the early rounds, provoked by Cassius,

Liston's anger caused him to abandon his fight plan. Now,

having been proven futile, Liston's confidence is gone.

He's left with nothing. Psychologically and athletically,

Liston is defeated. The BELL. Liston's eyes contemplate

the inevitable: face nine more rounds of this.

INT. RING, CASSIUS' CORNER - BETWEEN ROUNDS - AS CASSIUS

waits for the seventh-round bell.

Then Cassius, knowing before anybody else, suddenly rises as

if on wings. Both arms are in the air...followed by a roar

from the crowd...

And we can see Liston still sitting on his stool in his

corner, spitting out his mouthpiece.

Cassius jumps onto the ropes in the corner, rails the crowd:

All hell breaks loose...

Howard Cosell, the first to climb into the ring, is on him...

Bundini gives him a comb.   Cassius combing his hair.

And he sees Malcolm leaving his seat...they look at each

other. Malcolm's huge smile.

And Sam Cooke climbs into the ring.

As Sam Cooke embraces Cassius...

INT. ELIJAH MUHAMMAD'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - WIDE - NIGHT

A small older man with fine features, ELIJAH MUHAMMAD, THE

MESSENGER, sits on plastic-covered furniture in his

expensive living room. With him is an expressionless man

who, literally, never smiles, in a tailored dark suit. He's

JOSEPH 13X. As Elijah Muhammad, the head of the Nation of

Islam, contemplates Cassius' victory -- like everyone else

in America, he's surprised.

INT. THE MIAMI BEACH CONVENTION CENTER - PAY PHONE - NIGHT

GORDON DAVIDSON is from the Louisville Sponsoring Group,

standing in the chaos with another partner and Odessa and

Cassius, Sr....

INT. THE SIR JOHN NIGHTCLUB - SAM COOKE - NIGHT

singing "Feel It." It's packed with elated people. Outside,

celebrations spill out onto the streets...cars honking...

EXT./INT. HAMPTON HOUSE VILLAS - CLOSE ON COOKE AS HE

CROSSES - NIGHT

through the club, with lots of partygoers, picks up

Chesterfields from the cigarette girl and goes out by pool,

around which we see women at tables in cocktail dresses and

good-looking men. Most of the rooms' doors are wide open,

couples drinking, celebrating...radios playing out into the

Floridian night.

INT. THE BALLROOM, THE RONEY PLAZA HOTEL - GORDON DAVIDSON -

NIGHT

and others of the Louisville Sponsoring Group in a crowd of

predominantly white people, drinking free drinks at the

hastily arranged victory party, wait. Sportswriters...Jimmy

Cannon, Red Smith. Cassius, Sr. is there. They all wait.

No sign of Cassius. "Where's your boy?" A young New York

Times sportswriter, ROBERT LIPSYTE, is there as well. He

looks like he doesn't belong...his clothes are only

perfunctorily conventional, and he's a generation younger.

INT. HAMPTON HOUSE HOTEL ROOM - SAM COOKE - NIGHT

enters and closes the door and greets Malcolm X, in a white

shirt, no tie, and Cassius, eating ice cream in a pool of

light from the TV. Malcolm's wife, Betty Shabazz, comes out

of the kitchenette. A little girl runs from the bathroom

back to Cassius. The girl plops into his lap with much

familiarity, so we understand Cassius is family and has been

for a while. He's not at the Fontainebleau or the Roney

Plaza. It says Cassius' sense of himself is more about

what's next than what he did tonight.

Cassius feeds the girl some ice cream.

Laughter from the outside. Cassius looks. He's not drawn

to all the partying. Malcolm takes a picture with his

Contax. Through the door enters Jim Brown. Jim embraces

Malcolm and Betty, Sam Cooke, and congratulates the new

champ and helps himself to food.

INT. THE HAMPTON HOUSE HOTEL ROOM, 1964 - NIGHT, LATER

The room's near dark. Soft sounds from outside. A laugh.

A snatch of music. Malcolm's children are asleep on a cot.

And we see Cassius has fallen asleep on the sofa. A

bedsheet is over him. Malcolm and Betty, sitting at the

table in the kitchenette, quietly talking...an intimate

laugh...partners. And as Cassius, the new heavyweight

champion of the world, spends the first night of his reign

asleep at "home" with this family...

EXT. 125TH STREET + 7TH AVENUE - CASSIUS, MALCOLM + A CRUSH

OF PEOPLE (NEW YORK, 1964) - DAY

Suddenly we're in Harlem. The streets are jammed. Making

them crazy, causing a riot, coming down the sidewalk,

looking like a rock-and-roll star in a black leather jacket,

is CASSIUS CLAY and in an overcoat and hat, MALCOLM X. They

OWN this day on 125th Street.

EXT. MICHAUX BOOK SHOP - PEOPLE - DAY

engulf them. People are their army. The sea of people

press close to their heroes...reaching out to touch the

champ, share a joke, laugh. A girl runs up to hug Cassius

and runs off. We catch a glimpse on the periphery of Joseph

13X. Seven or eight reporters, black and white, and still

photographers and Bingham, half with Cassius, half

photographer in privileged position.

And Cassius drops it on them...

This is hard news!

JOSEPH 13X:   we read his face listening to Malcolm.

And, as he goes on, the crowd knows neither Cassius nor

Malcolm will ever turn their backs on them.

EXT. THE HOTEL THERESA - MALCOLM - NIGHT

enters into the street with his Bodyguard and looks up to a

top-floor window in which he sees a light is still on at 4 a.m.

INT. THE HOTEL THERESA, CASSIUS' ROOM - CASSIUS - BEFORE DAWN

asleep with the television on. There's a knock on the door.

Barely awake, he gets up to answer it. It's Malcolm. Still

in his familiar hat and overcoat. He hasn't slept...

He goes back to lay on the bed. Malcolm looks out the

window...the wet streets at night.

Malcolm's distracted.   He fingers his glasses.

Cassius is quiet.

That statement surprises Cassius, but he says nothing.

Malcolm X stands by the window and watches the day begin in

Harlem.

INT. ELIJAH MUHAMMAD'S HOUSE, CHICAGO, 1964 - JOSEPH 13X - DAY

approaches Cassius in a suit and tie and beckons him into a

living room in which sits Elijah Muhammad on a plastic-

covered white sofa. Cassius is at his most deferential,

awed at being in this man's presence. Elijah's power is the

inverse of his size. He's short and delicate-featured. He

motions for Cassius to sit beside him. Joseph 13X sits

across the room with two men.

And he's genuinely moved. As Elijah Muhammad puts his small

hands in Muhammad Ali's hands...giving him his blessings...

Extremely emotional about Malcolm, tears come to Elijah

Muhammad's eyes. Joseph 13X observes in the background.

Cassius is taken by surprise at "The Messenger"'s display...

And he looks across the room...a roly-poly man wearing a bow

tie...HERBERT MUHAMMAD. He has a habit of nervously

straightening his shirt. A seemingly mild, pleasant man, he

is without self-definition. Below this avuncular surface,

he defines himself by quietly desiring and acquiring what is

others'.

Elijah gives a subtle look and Herbert retreats to where he

came from, sitting back on the couch by Joseph 13X...

EXT. THE CLAY HOUSE, LOUISVILLE, 1964 - EVENING

We've entered mid-scene.

A neighboring family coming to stand beside Ali.   Cassius,

Sr. steps aside.

CASSIUS CLAY, SR., a sport, a flamboyant man, is impatient.

Inside, Odessa Clay and brother, Rudy, are talking.

They leave.

The light starts to go...porch lights starting to come on...

And we realize it has gotten too dark to see...

Bitter silences.

Cassius, Sr. walks off...his back arched too straight,

trying to hold his pride together.

And Odessa goes back inside.

INT. MALCOLM'S HOUSE, KITCHEN (QUEENS, NEW YORK), 1964 - NIGHT

We see Malcolm at work at the kitchen table.      It's cluttered

and small. The telephone rings...

Malcolm gets it.

Malcolm's still.    He's been co-opted.

Joseph 13X hangs up. Malcolm quietly closes the door.

Malcolm dials a number. No answer.

Betty has come in.   They exchange a look.

She puts her hand on Malcolm's shoulder.

INT. GHANA AIR DC-8 COCKPIT - ALI - NIGHT

in first class on a "Ghana Airlines" flight to Africa.

Close by is Herbert Muhammad. Howard Bingham and Ali's

brother, Rudy, are across the aisle from him, asleep...   The

plane bumps in choppy air.

Muhammad, unable to sleep, a nervous flyer, gets up. He

wanders up the aisle to the front of the plane. A Stewardess

comes out of the cockpit. Muhammad slows, startled by the

pilots. Both pilot and copilot are black.

Ali looks out the window...a new day downs over the land.

Then Bingham shows up over Ali's shoulder. They all pose,

facing the rear of the cockpit. Then, the Pilot points to

the coast below them and the sunrise...

EXT. BUILDING IN CAIRO - CABLE - DAY (EGYPT)

snakes out a building.   CAM FOLLOWS IT and we HEAR...

INT. CAIRO BUILDING - WIDE:   HALLWAY - DAY

MARLIN THOMAS -- paunchy, grey, late 40's -- walks up the

stairs carrying take-out food.

crosses to ANOTHER AMERICAN wearing headphones in the

glassed-in balcony where the CABLE connects to a portable

tape-recorder.

As the CIA monitors Malcolm X...

EXT. INDEPENDENCE SQUARE, ACCRA - ALI - DAY (GHANA)

in a Mercedes convertible. It's a monumental expression of

the force for the independence of black Africa. Accra is a

wonder to Ali. A Third World showplace, in 1964 Ghana is

alive with the optimism of emerging Africa. Infrastructure

and real estate are well-managed. Under Nkrumah, the city

is in a frenzy of building public housing...

ALI

in the three-car caravan, passes the huge triumphal arch

with its giant black star on the top. Thousands line the

route to see the heavyweight champion and cheer him. For

Ali it's another kind of parade...

ALI'S POV:   GHANAIANS

They're stockbrokers and street cleaners, salesmen and

secretaries, hotel managers and military officers... All is

a contrast to the de facto apartheid of the middle America

of Ali's experience. They all cheer his caravan as it passes.

EXT. THE AMBASSADOR HOTEL, ACCRA - MERCEDES - LATE AFTERNOON

(GHANA)

arrives with Ali and entourage. It's a modern hotel.

Meanwhile, a different group are about to depart in limos.

One among them, a tall Man in a dashiki and sunglasses and

carrying a walking stick, separates. He sees Ali. So does

the woman next to him. She is the poet Maya Angelou.

Taking off his shades, we realize it's Malcolm X. He wears

a goatee, now. Ali turns, sees him. Total surprise.

They embrace. Ali greets him like the old friend he is.

Maya and the Chinese diplomat wait a few steps removed.

And they remember how much they like each other.

Ali waves.   They keep their distance.

INT. AMBASSADOR HOTEL ROOM - MARLIN THOMAS - DAY

who was surveilling Malcolm X in Cairo is here, too. Right

now he picks up the phone. REVEAL at the window an African

Man and another American with binoculars.

INT. LEOPOLDVILLE SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - BRADLEY - DAY (CONGO)

BRADLEY, an American in his late 30's, who's balding and

whose mouth is too wide, sits at the teacher's desk in an

empty classroom. A heavyset American and two Black African

Thugs with M-1 carbines are with him.

Uniformed MOBUTU'S MILITARY AIDE smiles and warmly shakes

Bradley's hand. Bradley says "he's welcome" and signals to

the Heavyset American. The American leads Mobutu's Military

Aide somewhere. Meanwhile...

INT. LEOPOLDVILLE SCHOOL CORRIDOR - MOBUTU'S MILITARY AIDE

FOLLOWS BRADLEY'S AMERICAN

to a sports court. Eight Uniformed Soldiers are with them.

In the sports court, on their knees, hands bound behind them,

facing away from us, are six prisoners in business clothes.

One is a woman. Guarding them are Bradley's Guards.

Mobutu's Military Aide's soldiers take over the prisoners.

Mobutu's Military Aide talks into a walkie-talkie. Meanwhile...

GEN. JOSEPH MOBUTU IN UNIFORM

listens to his walkie-talkie. He has distant eyes. He's

heard what he needs and walks up a staircase and around a

corner.

INT. LEOPOLDVILLE SCHOOL, SECOND CLASSROOM - MOBUTU

enters. He is the beneficiary of this routine military coup.

Other uniformed officers at students' desks now stand and

applaud. Mobutu will rename the Congo "Zaire" and we'll see

him later. Meanwhile in Ghana...

INT. AMBASSADOR HOTEL ROOM - MARLIN THOMAS - DAY

EXT. AMBASSADOR HOTEL - ALI + MALCOLM X

Meanwhile...

The rapport between them becomes fleeting.   Ali's attention

drifts away. He closes down...

And Ali separates.   He turns away.   Malcolm calls after him...

Ali won't turn back from his rejection of Malcolm.   He

shakes his head "no" and walks off.

INT. TIGER LOUNGE, CHICAGO - SHERI - NIGHT

sings "For Your Precious Love," and REVEAL: ALI + SONJI ROI

dancing. We're back in Chicago. She's sexy and has a great

smile and flashing eyes. People leave Ali alone. One Fruit

of Islam bodyguard is nearby, semi-conspicuous. In a booth

is Herbert with a date, another FOI guard, and a businessman.

Sonji, who is sexually overt and fun, is laminated to Ali.

After a few bars...

My father named me after Sonja Henie.

What's your father do?

He was shot in a poker game when I

was two. He don't do nothin'.

Sonja, on the other hand, was an

ice skater, and my mother died when

I was eleven.

So who raised you?

Godparents, but I been on my own,

doing my own thing...

Whatcha doin' tomorrow?       Go ridin'

with me.

No.   I gotta work, you know.

I square it with Herbert.       I got a

record player in my car.

A record player?     C'mon.    How come

it don't skip?

Got springs and stuff.

Herbert said you met The Beatles.

Yeah. Only one of 'em's smart...the

one with the glasses.

...he's my favorite.

People all screaming and fainting.

I asked him, "This the way they act

when you get big?"

After Sheri sings the first chorus...

Herbert looks up from his booth, starts to ask where they're

going...but they're gone. He turns back to the man he's

talking to...

INT. SONJI'S APARTMENT - WINDOW - NIGHT (1964)

PULL BACK from being above Chicago in the winter at night to

Ali and Sonji making love where Sheri's voice sings the

second verse. To Ali's reactions...

She raises his head next to hers, looks in his eyes.

She laughs. He rests his head on her stomach.   He likes her

irreverence...

They start making love again.

EXT./INT. 50TH ON THE LAKE MOTEL, COFFEE SHOP - ALI, HERBERT,

BUNDINI + BINGHAM - DAY

Bundini cracks up. Ali signs without even glancing at the

documents. Bingham notices this.

As Ali signs the last of the contracts.

Ali and Bingham crack up...

INT. FIFTH STREET GYM - ALI

past a speed bag onto Ali with Dundee + Sarria on the

exercise table. They do NOT see, and we PASS them and other

training boxers and MOVE IN to a portable B&W TV on top of a

cabinet.

ON B&W TV:   MALCOLM X + MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.

exchange greetings and introductions as if in a first-time

meeting, and King turns back to CAMERA.

As an anchorman pontificates...IMAGE SUDDENLY BECOMES: FIVE

DIFFERENT SURVEILLANCE ANGLES. King and Malcolm have no

clue how extensive is the FBI Cointelpro surveillance and

the operations mounted against them. And the image of the

two of them becomes...

INT. A COFFEE SHOP (WASHINGTON, D.C.) - THEIR PICTURE -

SMILEY - DAY

on the front page of the Washington Post. REVEAL Joseph 13X

sitting next to JOE SMILEY in a small Washington, D.C.

coffee shop.

Joseph 13X stares at him, slack-jawed.    Incredulous.   No

reaction.

Joseph 13X doesn't say anything.    He does not smile.

Joseph 13X oddly gets up, moving a stool over...

Smiley indicates the picture of Ali in "Muhammad Speaks"

identifying him as a militant and a revolutionary.

Off Ali's picture...it becomes...

INT. MIAMI HOTEL ROOM - ALI - NIGHT

enters, looking for Sonji. Bundini and Cassius Clay, Sr.

were laughing about something else. They got quiet.

Bundini has a large water glass in his hand; Sr., a highball

glass.

Ali goes to the bedroom door.

He's dressed for an occasion.

As Ali re-enters the living room, there's a knock on the

door..."Room Service..."

And, now, Sonji comes out. This dress makes what she had

been wearing look demure. Tight angora sweater and a

miniskirt. She's Tina Turner 30 years ago.

Ali takes her back into the bedroom and closes the door.

INT. BEDROOM - SONJI + ALI - NIGHT

He's furious. She smiles. He picks her up. She moans and

her tongue darts in his ear and they're on the bed making

out. And as CAMERA DRIFTS away we HEAR D.J. Daddio Daley's

"Jazz Patio"...

INT. A NEW CAR (CHICAGO) - ALI - DAY

king of the city, cruising through the pristine winter air

of Chicago...

Segues to...Brubeck's "Time Out," cruising...

INT. THE AUDUBON BALLROOM, HARLEM - REAR OF MALCOLM'S HEAD -

DAY

center-punches the   FRAME through the green-glazed terra-

cotta hallway. He    and his Bodyguard (#1) come to a door.

Shedding his coat,   he hesitates, and like a prizefighter

gathering himself,   he goes inside.

INT. ALI'S NEW CAR - ALI - DAY

at a light, waves to a cluster of girls waiting for a bus

who recognize him, go nuts...listening to Brubeck...

INT. THE AUDUBON BALLROOM - MALCOLM - DAY

walks across the stage, aware of every little sound, every

motion. He makes his way to the podium...peering beyond his

glasses at the gathered. Bodyguard #1 goes to the side door

instead of standing next to him...and Malcolm notices

that...as he...

And two young Black men, TALMADGE HAYER and NORMAN BUTLER

immediately stand up in the back, jostling each other...

And the commotion in the back diverts Bodyguards #1 and #2

towards the rear, away from the stage and Malcolm, as...

THOMAS JOHNSON comes forward from a front row, his coat

flapping open, revealing the 12-gauge sawed-off double-

barrel shotgun coming up.

MALCOLM'S EYES

go to it.    Settle on it.   He new it was coming, as...

JOHNSON, an indifferent expression on his face, FIRES one

barrel at...

MALCOLM

...which rips through the lectern as if paper and SLAMS a

dead-center into his chest a seven-ring. 12 pellets, each

the size of .32 bullet. Seven destroy Malcolm's heart.

Five shred his aorta and burrow into his spine. Malcolm's

hands fly back, and he topples, crashing off empty chairs

onto the floor.

UPSIDEDOWN ECU:   MALCOLM'S FACE + PAST

...as life exhales from his mouth and his eyes go grey,

dying, indifferent to Johnson emptying a second blast into

him and the meaningless indignities of Hayer and Butler

firing a .45 and a 9mm Luger at him.

INT. ALI'S CAR - RADIO - DAY

Dave Brubeck, loud...

INT. THE AUDUBON BALLROOM - STAGE - DAY

Chaos. Malcolm on the floor. Betty kneels over his body,

desperately trying to breathe life into it. An Asian woman,

a disciple, holds up his head. Somebody shouts, "Jesus,

God!" But there is no God today...

INT. ALI'S CAR - ALI - DAY

stops short at a light because a man runs across the street.

LOUD Brubeck in 5/4 time.    Ali can't hear.

Ali rolls down the window.

"Daddio's Jazz Patio" is interrupted. Malcolm X has been

killed. Ali pulls over...not really parking. The world

stops. The South Side of Chicago goes still...people

numb...a young Man sitting down on the curb, crying. An

elegy...Sam Cooke's "A Change is Gonna Come..." plays. "I

was born by a river in a little tent..." And as Ali sits in

his car...he sees the face of Malcolm...the glasses...

He's overcome with a deep grief and a lack of confidence in

the order of his world.

INT. THE RING, ST. DOMINIC'S ARENA (LEWISTON, MAINE) - ALI -

NIGHT

...sees Sonji enter in a sequined mini-dress, bouffant hair.

She attracts attention and disapproval from Herbert. She

sits next to Ali's parents at ringside amid the large,

conservatively dressed Muslim contingent. He's angry at her

presentation. She looks like a girl singer from a doo-wop

group. He slips off his robe. Ali raises his gloves in

Muslim prayer. Meanwhile: the BELL rings.

ALI

meets Liston, nails him with a straight right. Ali begins

baiting him, dancing. Liston tries to cut off the ring,

jabbing ineffectually. Ali lets Liston in, pulls back, then

pivots on his right foot, throws a short right and RAMP INTO

SLO-MO...to see Liston not see it coming.

The muscles of Ali's upper body contract and ripple in

release after his short RIGHT catches Liston on the point of

his chin. Liston drops to the canvas like a stone.

Sonji is up. For some reason, tears of worry stream,

absurdly, from her eyes.

The IMAGE:   Ali standing over Liston, fist cocked, bellowing:

Liston tries to get up, rolls over. His left leg spasms.

As the ref finally pushes Ali to a neutral corner.

INT. MUHAMMAD'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Sarria, Bundini, Pacheco as Dundee cuts the tape off

Muhammad's hands. And Sonji appears at the door...runs and

embraces Ali.

EXT. HOLIDAY INN, BALCONY - ALI - NIGHT

enters up the stairs. Bundini's waiting for him as are

Reporters, trying to ambush him. Lots of activity in the

motel forecourt.

Bundini indicates and Ali exits into Herbert's room. Beyond

is the Holiday Inn marquee: "Clay vs. Liston II." A few

letters droop.

EXT. HOLIDAY INN, HERBERT'S ROOM - ALI - NIGHT

Ali, angry, stands in front of Herbert.

Cassius, Sr. bursts in.   Bundini has Ali's championship belt

over his shoulder.

Bundini and Herbert start to leave.

Cassius, Sr. leaves the room.

INT. HOLIDAY INN, ALI'S MOTEL ROOM - HIGH ANGLE:   ALI - NIGHT

enters. Stands at the dresser. Only his suitcase is there.

She left her chartreuse blouse. He takes it and smells the

scent of her cologne. He is torn with grief at the loss of

her, curling into a ball on the bed, alone in the room.

INT. GREEN ROOM - ALI - DAY

getting made up by a good-looking ASIAN COSMETOLOGIST. An

ASSISTANT DIRECTOR lounges against the wall with headset,

reading the newspaper...

She laughs and whispers something in Ali's ear, holding his

hand where the others can't see it and slips her phone

number to him. Meanwhile...a phone rings. Bundini answers

while...

INT. A NEW YORK TELEVISION STUDIO, ABC - COSELL - DAY

"Wide World of Sports" is ON THE AIR.   We've entered mid-

broadcast.

Ali lifts Howard's toupee.

Laughter.

INT. ABC TELEVISION STUDIO, BACKSTAGE - ALI + COSELL - LATER

Ali pours three spoons of sugar in his coffee.

He's screwed either way.

EXT./INT. THE UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES STATION, HOUSTON -

LOBBY - CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE - DAY

waits at the curb as Ali and Herbert pull up and get out of

a car...move through the crowd...reporters shouting

questions at him we don't hear, go up the steps, into the

lobby, joining other recruits and M.P.'s.

He gives Ali a piece of paper signed by the Justice

Department, confirming the deal...

We're not sure what Ali will do.

INT. INDUCTION CENTER, HOUSTON - ALI - DAY

lined up with the twenty-five other inductees...being

addressed by an Induction Officer, Naval LT. JEROME CLARIDGE...

Lt. Claridge begins to read the names, and services...the

young Men dutifully stepping forward. Ali expects his name

to be called. Instead...

It's quiet. Dead quiet. Ali's lips move. NO sound comes

out. We anticipate him stepping forward...he doesn't.

TWO FBI AGENTS in suits have appeared.

Ali doesn't move.

Herbert's dying.    Ali "stands his ground..." and the die has

been cast.

As they turn around and handcuff him.

EXT. HOLIDAY INN (HOUSTON) - ALI + ENTOURAGE - LATE AFTERNOON

approach from two vehicles. Rudy and SIX LARGE MUSLIMS

escort Ali through the crowd of media trucks, reporters and

conspicuous unmarked police cars and neighborhood people.

ALI

waves in Robert Lipsyte, the New York Times sportswriter in

his late 20's we've seen before. He and Howard Bingham,

waiting inside, know each other. They enter. The phone's

already RINGING.

INT. HOLIDAY INN ROOM + BALCONY - ALI

on the phone, on a long extension, joined by Lipsyte and

Howard Bingham, while Bundini keeps at bay reporters at the

front door. It all feels like a rock group in town for a

concert.

Ali hangs up.   The phone rings again.

Next is something Ali has not deduced. Ali perceives it

intuitively and reflexively. As with other of his decisions,

once made, he doesn't hesitate to speak them. And he won't

waver. He says...

It goes dead silent.   Ali listens.   Lipsyte is stunned.

So's Howard.

He hangs up.

And that's the real Ali, right there.

INT. HOLIDAY INN, ALI'S SUITE - ALI - NIGHT

laying on the sofa. Dundee, Pacheco and Rudy have joined.

There's the feeling the house is a bunker. Phones ring.

Television is on. LIPSYTE, taking notes, watching Walter

Cronkite on TV. He crosses to Ali. Dundee's on the phone.

The expression on Ali's face is blank, as if he's accepting

a pounding: he knows what it is; it's not a surprise.

INT. GRANT PARK UNDERGROUND GARAGE - QUIET - NIGHT

A very low ceiling; we're in a green-lit cavern with a low

ceiling. Chauncey Eskridge and Ali wait. Ali's in the

backseat of a 1961 Lincoln. Two FOI guards stationed at the

distant ramps allow a Black Oldsmobile to pass.

BOB ARUM

a New York lawyer and promoter arrives and climbs out of the

Oldsmobile. Ali opens the door...but doesn't get out...

Ali's quiet, not really listening anymore...

INT. ILLINOIS BOXING COMMISSION - ALI - DAY

wearing a suit and a narrow tie at a table in front of Daley

machine apparatchiks. A bald man, angrily:

Ali gets up and walks out on them.   Eskridge and NOI men in

black suits follow.

INT. CHICAGO OFFICE BUILDING - ALI + ENTOURAGE - DAY

march through the lobby. Ali gives a walking interview.

He's angry. He won't slow down.

INT. THE HOUSTON ASTRODOME - CLOSE:   TERRELL - DAY

ERNIE TERRELL is taller than Ali. The empty stadium has a

scale and press at one end. Girls in cowboy hats and lone

stars say we're in Texas. Ali is distracted.

Terrell wrongly thinks there's psychological value in

provoking Ali.

Ali throws a punch that doesn't land because he's separated.

CLOSE ON ALI

something else in his eyes.

INT. THE HOUSTON ASTRODOME - TERRELL - NIGHT

hit FOUR TIMES by Ali:   WHAM, WHAM, WHAM, WHAM!   In the

glaring lights...

And Ali flicks out punches...disorienting Terrell.   The BELL.

GIRL IN BANGLED MINISKIRT STARTS 15TH ROUND

WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! Ali hits him five times...Terrell ties

him up. Ali throws him off, slips two jabs and snaps his

left into Terrell's face.

Ali, at the apex of his athletic skills, fires six- or

eight-punch combinations and then changes direction. Ali

shoots jabs and hooks going backwards; every move and set of

combinations is a dance. Ali's never been as light on his

feet, as fast, as complex as in this fight. Like any moment

of greatness, we want it to last forever... Then, Ali

throws a 17-punch combination.

...that burns down Terrell. Terrell starts to fall. Ali

moves away. He doesn't want it to end. Sportswriters don't

like it. Half the fans don't like it. Ali defies both

their sensibilities and their politics.

TERRELL'S

face is battered.    Ali SLAMS in SHOTS.

The BELL ends the savage pounding. Ali in the middle of the

ring, glorying in opposition and triumph.

INT. HOUSTON COURTROOM - ALI - DAY

with Eskridge and his other attorneys. The courtroom's

packed. In the back we spot Joe Smiley, anonymous in the crowd.

INT. HOUSTON COURT, FOYER - ALI - DAY

on his way out of the building.    Media is held at the other end.

CLOSER - ALI

looks dazed, not sure how to act on the way out of court.

Oddly, he shakes hands with each of a half a dozen white

Houston Bailiffs. It's as if, benumbed by the verdict, he

seeks human contact. The only contact available, ironically,

is with the officers of the court that just convicted him.

EXT. 79TH STREET, CHICAGO, 1968 - ALI - DUSK

Time has passed. It's winter. Snow's on the ground. He's

in a car coat and a hat with a hooded sweatshirt underneath.

Street lights are on. Traffic's slight. He walks through

the whiteness as new snow falls.

ECU:   ALI

under the hat brim, his gaze is internal, as it was in the

opening in Miami.

BURNED-OUT STOREFRONT

with icicles from Fire Dept. water. His work boots stop

deep in the new falling snow...vanishing in the WHITEOUT...

INT. N.O.I. BAKERY, CHICAGO - WHITE SILK SCARF - DAY (FLASHBACK)

in Ali's hands. He leans across a white showcase of bakery

goods. It's cold outside; warm inside. It smells of bread

and coffee. BELINDA BOYD reacts.

He makes a fist, balls the scarf up, and puts it in the

hollow of his fist.

She blows on it. She's not quite eighteen, six feet tall;

there's a supremely confident expressiveness about her. Her

gestures are large. He opens his hand. The scarf is gone.

She instinctively looks over at his other hand. Nothing's

there. His eyes go wide in mock fright at the mysterious.

She laughs. How'd he do it? He makes a fist again, puts

his thumb in the hollow. And slowly pulls the scarf out...

He gives it to Belinda. She ties it around her neck. Ali

looks at her. On a cold and dark afternoon, the windows are

steamed and the bakery seems a fine refuge.

She slaps his arm.

INT. NATION OF ISLAM ASSEMBLY - ALI + BELINDA - DAY (FLASHBACK)

The African-American Albert Speer-regimented seating breaks

up. Ali's wearing a black suit, a white suit and white tie.

As he drifts through the crowd, approaching him is Belinda

in a white caftan and a white satin turban with gold

earrings. It feels like they are an official couple,

eugenically chosen mates.

ECU:    THEIR HANDS

touch. She turns and leans back slightly against him...

Their thighs touch.

EXT. 79TH STREET, CHICAGO - DUSK INTO NIGHT

We walk past the bakery. It's closed.     Ali crosses the grey

guttered street and exits into...

INT. ALI'S SINCLAIR STATION, BACK OFFICE - ALI - NIGHT

enters. CTA bus passes. Eskridge is there, waiting for him.

Ali takes a coffee in a paper cup and grabs a Danish.

They start out towards the gas pumps.

They seek to destroy every facet of Ali's life. Ali knows

that. As they pass the pumps. Some customers recognize him.

And Ali pretends to start sparring. The working men laugh.

One is brave enough to raise his hands, too. Ali smiles and

trades a couple of phantom slaps. It breaks off. He made

their day. He shakes each of their hands. His spirit's

raised, he walks off. Chauncey watches this ritual...

INT. CHICAGO APARTMENT, ALI + BELINDA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

hands and skin and faces against white in bed.   So close we

are intimately inside the moment...

Laughing, he starts poking her in the ribs, and she turns

onto him. She's six feet tall, he's six-three. He grabs

her wrist. She wrestles him down on the large bed until

there's a NOISE, and Belinda separates from Ali and

approaches a smaller bedroom to replace the bottle their

daughter, MARYUM, threw out of her crib. As she exits, MOVE

IN on the crib in streetlight and we HEAR Jimi Hendrix's

bottleneck instrumental part of "All Along the Watchtower."

It makes us feel the child in the crib is threatened, and

that takes us INTO...

INT. COLLEGE HALL - ALI

in a black leather jacket with a white shirt and skinny tie,

speaking to an audience of college students, white and black,

some Asian and Latino.

Bingham waits in the wings. Applause. Ali joins Howard and

a small group watching a portable TV...

TV:   "DAYS OF RAGE"

occurring on Chicago's North Clark Street. Off-screen we

HEAR police sirens. On TV, Weathermen attack lines of

Chicago police! The cops fall back.

INT. CHICAGO GYM - ALI - NIGHT

trains in grey sweats to Hendrix. He flashes 60 sit-ups

hanging off a table. He sweats profusely. He has no

trainers. Bingham holds his legs. Ali seems heavier.

The gym is grimy, filled with other boxers, a forest of

heavy bags. Ali's one among other guys working out.

ALI'S FACE

grimacing through another set, trying to stay in shape,

trying to retain skills going dormant.

Then, he's slow on the heavy bag.   Sparring alone in the

ring... Everyone ignores him.

INT. ALI'S GAS STATION - ALI'S TV:   NEWS - DAY

REVEAL Ali + Bingham watching the 1968 Olympics. NOW, Tommy

Smith and John Carlos bow their heads and raise fists in

black power defiance, instead of acknowledging the national

anthem.

And the coverage cuts to George Foreman with a small

American flag in his hand. Then, it flashes back to Ali in

the ring with Sonny Liston at his feet. And Ali coming out

of the Illinois Boxing Commission, angry. Dead Black

Panthers, Fred Hampton and Matt Clark murdered by police in

Chicago. And Malcolm X and Ali together. The meaning of it

is clear: MUHAMMAD ALI IS THE WARRIOR SAINT IN THE REVOLT

OF THE BLACK ATHLETE IN AMERICA. On Ali watching, as a

phone rings...

EXT. MEMPHIS MOTEL - CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE - DAY

EXT. MEMPHIS MOTEL - CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE

A fast car drives by, distracting Ali momentarily.   Then,

Ali focuses 100% on...

There's no response from Ali.   Ali hangs up, looks the other

way, lost in thought.

EXT. MEMPHIS MOTEL ROOM - CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE - DAY

hangs up the phone. Looks up. Starts to dial another

number. A sound CRACKS OPEN THE NIGHT...

Chauncey runs up the stairs to the second-floor balcony to

join...

EXT. MEMPHIS MOTEL, BALCONY - JESSE JACKSON - DAY

cradling Martin Luther King, Jr. in his arms. People SCREAM.

King involuntarily spasms. Under King, dark blood pools

like crude oil. Eskridge, ANDREW YOUNG and JULIAN BOND

point into the Memphis afternoon.

EXT. ALI'S APARTMENT BUILDING, ROOFTOP (CHICAGO) - CITY AT

NIGHT

as if they were pointing at a burning fire, sirens, blue

police flashers, an isolated gunshot. And REVEAL Ali on a

rooftop, in sweatpants, sweatshirt, SHADOWBOXING while...

He leaves off to look into the distance. The agility, what

he was with Terrell, isn't there. He exhales in time with

punches HUH, HUH, HUH...Ali's struggling to hold onto

diminishing sharpness. Police lights. Looting? He

contemplates the fabric of the city ripping itself apart

while...

INT. JEFFREY STREET HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - FRAZIER RIPS APART

ELLIS - NIGHT

on ABC. REVEAL Ali with Maryum in his arms watches the

fight...an activity from which Ali, the resident genius on

the planet, is excluded.

Belinda brings coffee to Bingham...

Belinda takes Maryum. FRAZIER holds his arms up in victory,

a formality of applause from the half-empty Garden.

Ali crosses to kitchen phone.

Ali stops. Between him and Belinda, this is important:   her

solidarity is with her husband, not with the NOI.

As Ali contemplates what she's said, we HEAR...

INT. FRAZIER LOCKER ROOM (POST FIGHT) - COSELL + FRAZIER -

NIGHT

Someone's talking into Howard's period headset.

A still photo of Ali in an iris appears superimposed on

monitors.

Ali hesitates.

INT. ELIJAH MUHAMMAD'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Elijah Muhammad reacts to the interview on television.

There's a formality to Elijah Muhammad, even at his kitchen

EXT. U.S. STEEL - ALI - DAY

runs through tall reeds in the abandoned industrial

landscape, ending at the lakefront and the cold, open sky

and water. He's breathing hard, struggling against time to

hold onto shape and prowess. He seems vulnerable against

the open sky and water.

INT. TEMPLE #2 - NIGHT

Elijah Muhammad is at the lectern ringed by Fruit of Islam

Guards. HERBERT is behind him.

INT. JEFFREY ST. HOUSE, KITCHEN - ALI - DAY

sits at the table. A deep vacancy is beginning to be there

we've never seen before. May-may makes a mess.

MOVE CLOSER and CLOSER into Ali's eyes. He's oblivious.

Belinda's pregnant again. She says something to him. Ali

can't hear. She says it again, louder. Ali doesn't look at

her. OVER ALI onto the Formica table with Log Cabin syrup

and powdered sugar and ceramic salt and pepper shakers SEEN

in his ECU, disconnected, depressed, withdrawn...

INT. FLOPHOUSE, FOYER - ALI + BINGHAM - DAY

entering, concerned and urgent...

Ali's up the stairs, down the corridor and takes the key

from the lady and opens the door. It's a dump. Rotting

food, something burned on the stove. On the floor, wrapped

in a threadbare bedspread, half in and out of the bathroom,

which is foul, is Bundini, sleeping off a drunk.

Ali -- his concern crashes. He detests the type Bundini

resembles. He throws a half-empty half-pint of Old Taylor

against the wall. It splatters...

Ali goes to the curtains and pulls them back.    Bundini,

blinded...

Ali grabs Bundini's arm and twists it and pushes his sleeve

up. Bundini tries to pull his arm away. Ali is way

stronger. Track marks up and down Bundini's arm. Ali slaps

Bundini on the side of the head. SMACK! He slaps him again.

SMACK!

Bundini flails back with his arms.    Ali leans in and SMACKS

him again.

There's a pause in the room.    Bundini crashes.    He starts

crying, unabashedly...

Ali leans back against the wall...the last vestige, gone.

Ali gets up -- Bundini has been taken from him, too -- and

leaves.

INT. "EL" - ECU FRONTAL:    ALI - NIGHT

and beyond the side of Ali's face, elevated through the

slums and decrepit tenements of the south side of

Chicago...the mean alleys and decaying back porches. Men

gathered around 50-gallon steel drums, burning wood for

warmth. Everything is corrupted or has left him.

FRONTAL:    ALI

staring into nowhere.

REVERSE:    PAST ALI

The city recedes. Vectors, in perspective, carry structures,

buildings away. The sky is grey, going to blue. The city

flees and SUDDENLY disappears as we race into the dark

tunnel of subway. Ali's lost in the depths of attempting a

calculation. He can't do that for which he has a genius

beyond other men...

And he's been exiled from the belief system that explained

the universe to him. SUDDENLY LIGHTS slash across his face

in the white-tile North Avenue station. BEYOND, ghostlike

working men and two heavyset women enter. Ali turns aside

to prevent being recognized. It's the first time he's ever

avoided the public. The train lurches forward...

OVER ALI:    WHITE LIGHT

screams away from us. Red reflects off the rails past Ali's

face as we descend deeper into the tunnels.

EXT. NEAR BROADCAST TRUCK - COSELL - NIGHT

steps out of the truck. There is a small crowd of people

who turn as ALI pulls up in a convertible. He's solemn for

a moment. Then he's out of the car...

Reveal Ali next to his car.

EXT. NEAR BROADCAST TRUCK - ALI + COSELL - LATER

alone in the convertible parked in a distant corner of the lot.

INT. ABC-TV STUDIO

Ali being interviewed by Howard Cosell in the "Wide World of

Sports" set. We've entered mid-scene...

There's laughter off-camera in the studio and a wry smile on

Cosell's face.

The phones in the master control booth and ringing off the

hook...the public's reaction to Ali's Bre'r Rabbit routine.

Ali used his ability to command presence in media to promote

the only fight the public wants to see...

EXT. CLAY HOUSE - CASSIUS, SR. - DAY

Ali's dad sits on a crate, painting the door of a delivery

truck. He looks up...Ali is there. Emotion wells up in

both men. The younger "rebelistic" son, seeing his father,

who is so like him. The older hep-cat who got cheated by

life of his potential and promise. In this case, his boy,

his boy's name, pride and reflected glory...

As they embrace, Odessa comes out, watches them.

EXT. BROAD STREET - PHILADELPHIA - DAY

Ali stands on the street corner, shades, incognito. A gold

Cadillac pulls up: JOE FRAZIER. He is wearing a lemon

yellow cowboy outfit, Stetson hat, striped pants. Ali looks

at him in disbelief.

Ali gets in, Frazier takes off. He sits sideways on the

seat, steers with one finger, flicks on the radio: Isaac Hayes.

Frazier screeches to a stop in the middle of Columbia Avenue.

Frazier stops in front of his renovated duplex in the North

Philadelphia ghetto.

They drive off.   After a moment, Frazier looks sideways at him.

And Ali rests a hand on Frazier's shoulder, and they drive

off like that.

INT. FIFTH STREET GYM - ALI + LARRY HOLMES - DAY

sparring. Ali's sweating more than we have seen him sweat

before. It's pouring off him. It stains wet his grey

sweatsuit. INTO HIS EYES, through the headgear...

WIDER

Bingham takes pictures. Sarria, Rudy and the media in force

are there for the start of Ali's comeback.

FROM BEHIND ALI'S HEAD GEAR

Ali spots...a figure step through the door. It's Bundini.

Ali, seeing everything all the time, reacts not at all,

turns his back. Bundini is thin, drawn, stooped, but clear-

eyed. Everyone turns. It takes tremendous courage for

Bundini to walk to the ring, expecting another rejection.

Ali goes to Angelo in his corner.

Ali first acknowledges Bundini.     Ali moves down the rope,

scowls down at him.

Ali considers this man: all jive and bullshit and also his

shaman and resident poet.

Bundini slowly comes alive, then:

They look at each other.

INT. CITY AUDITORIUM, ATLANTA - ALI + QUARRY - NIGHT

We've entered mid-fight in the second round. We're VERY

CLOSE. Quarry has Ali against the ropes. Ali pushes him

off. Quarry comes in again. Ali dances, feints and catches

Quarry over his right eye with a jab thrown while going

backwards!

QUARRY

shakes it off. Reorganizes. Throws two jabs, a right to

the body and tries to follow it up with a left hook. Ali

ties him up. The ref separates them. Quarry comes in again.

Ali throws a left cross over Quarry's right, which Ali

leaned away from, and adds two rapid, glancing jabs to the

same spot. And Ali OPENS A CUT. The BELL sounds, ending

Round Two.

CROWD

goes nuts, that part that's pro-Ali: Atlanta's black elite

and scattered whites. And the thunderous noise becomes one

sound, one momentum, cheering their warrior saint, their

defiant champion's return. And their ROAR becomes

THUNDER...a momentum unto its own, driving...

ALI'S CORNER:    ALI

can't wait for the bell to ring. He sucks in a huge breath

through his nose and blows it out. Angelo applies Vaseline.

The BELL sounds Round Three.

INT. THE RING - OVER ALI

Past him, hearing him, we ARE him. We think what he thinks;

see what he sees. Quarry's corner worked on the cut. Ali

feints a left and throws a left cross over Quarry's attempt

to block it. Quarry comes in again. Ali's next three

ripping left jabs almost like karate shots...all with a

sharp snap at the point of impact...

QUARRY'S EYEBROW

streams blood...       Interposing himself between their arms...

REFEREE

stops the fight.       Irish Jerry Quarry damned by skin that

cuts and bleeds.

CROWD

goes nuts! Their champion has returned. ALI throws his

arms in the air. QUARRY'S arguing not to have the fight

stopped. Now he appeals to Ali!

CLOSE:    ALI + QUARRY

Ali knows Quarry's anguish. They embrace. Ali says things

to him. And for that moment they are an island. Ali and

Quarry, their arms interlocked, are their own tribe. Two

pugilists, no longer adversarial, a class unto themselves.

Then...

ALI'S

picked up by Angelo. Bundini's run into the ring.       Ali's

arrived. He is coming back.

INT. MUHAMMAD'S DRESSING ROOM - ALI - NIGHT

seated, being examined by Pacheco, his hands still taped.

The dressing room's crowded. Belinda enters, embraces her

husband. Then Ali hears a familiar voice. He sees Herbert

Muhammad, along with the expressionless Joseph 13X and

another NOI Man, have entered.

Ali squeezes her hand...and Herbert quietly comes over.

He's nervous.

And people, feeling the awkwardness, give them room...moving

out of earshot.

Herbert's convinced he's getting told "no."

The reversal surprises Herbert; angers Belinda.

Ali stops him, keeps him distant.

Herbert and Joseph 13X leave.

Belinda stares at him, containing her fury. Ali confronts

her look, frankly, then turns to get dressed.

INT. THE DINING HALL - ALI - LATE AFTERNOON

and Belinda, with new twin babies; Maryum; Dundee; Pacheco;

Cassius, Sr.; Sarria; and Ali's entourage. They're all

around long tables, eating dinner. A large sign over the

kitchen counter with "Lana Shabazz' Ten Commandments"...like:

#7 "Anyone bringing guestes in for dinner without prior

notice will be awarded thwacks on skull with sharpe object."

#8 "Please waite, Rome wasn't burnt in a day; it takes a

while to burne the roaste." Lana Shabazz answers a phone

and brings it to Ali. Ali's got one of the twins, feeding

her a bottle and drinking from it, too.

INT. ABC WIDE WORLD OF SPORTS SET - COSELL - DAY

INT. THE DINING HALL - ALI - LATE AFTERNOON

takes in the news, thanks Howard and hangs up. It is a

shining moment after living under the threat of imprisonment

for three-and-a-half years.

INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - WIDE - NIGHT

A sea of glitter: the Black royalty of America in their

'70's robes. Movie stars 20 rows back. Burt Lancaster is

Cosell's color man. Frank Sinatra is working as a still

photographer. In the press section are Plimpton types,

Schulberg/Mailer types, Lipsyte, Cosell.

MICROPHONE

descends from the overhead lighting grid.   The announcer's

hand takes it...

ALI looking out the hood of his robe, dancing, shaking it

out, loosening up.

Catcalls and boos. The other half is a comeback sound. It

is a nation divided: pro-war right-wingers, Nixon supporters

are for Frazier; the anti-war movement, celebrities, New

York liberal establishment, blacks, Puerto Ricans and

hippies are for Ali.

The contentious roar diminishes only slightly for the announcer.

ALI'S EYES

deep in his focused concentration. His attention so arrow

like it reminds us of the younger man in the Liston

fight...pure purpose.

THE RING

...only SILENCE as the referee's instructions are given in

SLO-MOTION. Ali bounces on the canvas. We HEAR his feet

shift, turn, dance...and his breathing, expectant. Here

comes the return of what was unfairly taken: his heavyweight

championship.

MID-FIGHT - ALI

looks swollen,      out of breath. Something's wrong! Two solid

Ali jabs and a      right hook connect. But they slow down

Frazier not at      all. Joe Frazier, short and compact, like a

pit bull, bobs      and weaves his way inside Ali's longer reach.

ALI'S CORNER - DUNDEE + BUNDINI

shouting instructions.        None get through.   Ali looks slow.

Older.

INT. RING - PROFILE:       ALI + FRAZIER

Frazier, off his bobbing and weaving, launches his

devastating left hook to Ali's head. Frazier is making the

most of what he is: smaller. Ali clinches.

VERY LOW:     FRAZIER + ALI

The referee separates them. Both men throw and miss...Ali

on the right, Frazier on the left. Ali throws a hard left

that catches Frazier but doesn't stop him. Now Frazier

connects with a wild left hook into Ali's cheekbone. THE

UNTHINKABLE HAPPENS...

OVERHEAD:     ALI

is knocked down onto his knee. Ruled a slip, he stands

immediately and continues. Ali, backed against the rope

again, blocks shots, pushes Frazier into the middle of the

ring...

ALI SWINGS FRAZIER

around.     But Frazier cranks his left.     ALI SEES IT COMING...

But Ali's legs DON'T work fast enough. Frazier's hook

CRASHES into Ali's face. Ali goes rubbery as he backs to

the rope. Ali comes out and backs to the rope on the other

side, with cartoon rubbery legs. But the mimicry is

camouflage. He really is wobbling. The crowd is going wild.

We HEAR everything, now.

FRAZIER

is wary. He doesn't trust Ali. He walks across the ring,

allowing Ali to recuperate...THE BELL. Ali walks to his

corner, drained...

Ali saved himself with GUILE.

ROUND FIFTEEN:

They clinch. They separate. They both...as if mirror

images of each other...crouch, looking for shots. Ali's

right is down. Frazier's right is down. As they both rise

up out of the crouch, Frazier's out of the box first. Ali's

right is coming around. Frazier's left hook slams Ali

across the jaw. Ali goes down. Half the crowd ROARS for

Frazier. Ali gets right up and stands in the corner and

takes the mandatory eight-count. The right side of his face

is swollen like a balloon. They resume...

OVERHEAD:    ANOTHER CLINCH

Ali takes another right, but the ropes hold him up. Another

left catches Ali. Frazier's face is a grotesque, swollen

mask. He doesn't care.

ALI

is exhausted.    Labored breathing.     The crowd cheering Frazier.

THEN THE BELL.

Ali drops his arms. He knows he lost. Frazier raises his

arms. He knows he won. Half the crowd cheers.

INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN, ALI'S DRESSING ROOM - ALI - NIGHT

Not only have we seen Ali lose for the first time, not only

do we see him bruised, but when a fighter's beaten,

everybody who believes in him is beaten. Angelo's cutting

the tape off his hands. Bundini places an ice pack on the

back of his neck.

Bundini's wise enough to say nothing.

Rudy heard...

As they leave, the door reveals packed media outside.   Door

closes. Now it's only the inner circle.

Pacheco looks at Ali's hand. It shakes. Pacheco looks at

Ali's eyes and has him follow his finger.

Ali throws a water bottle. It shatters and splays wet down

the wall. There is mature, deep-seated, dead-serious molten

anger. Everybody in the room feels it.

INT. CORRIDOR

With Bundini, Bingham, Rudy and Sarria as a wedge, Ali

drives through reporters on the way to Belinda. Press mob

Ali...

INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN, AID STATION - BELINDA - NIGHT

sees Ali...the beating.       She begins crying.

Ali moves to her, followed by Bingham and Pacheco.     A

doctor's approaching with a sedative in a syringe.

Ali leans over, speaks softly.

Embracing her, his eyes connect with Dundee. Ali's Supreme

Court victory is meaningless. It's drowned by the loss of

what the political persecution took from him: his prime,

his season that would have been his most brilliant.

INT. SAN DIEGO SPORTS ARENA, ALI VS. NORTON I (2ND ROUND) -

TWO FIGHTERS - NIGHT

BLUR in SLO-MO.       Focus is beyond, to the crowd.

OVER ALI:    OUT-OF-FOCUS KEN NORTON'S RIGHT FIST

starts an arc...or jams towards us.

RIDING NORTON'S FIST - SLO-MO

towards Ali. We PASS crowd, the lighting grid above and

SLAM into the side of Ali's jaw, and on the moment of impact...

ECU:   X-RAY IMAGE - SLO-MO

of Ali's jaw breaking, shearing, leaving an eighth-inch gap

in the bone of the lower mandible...and becomes...

CMS:   ALI

taking the shot, covering and assaulting, covering with his

left, which he turns into a jab, aggressively going after

Norton.

IMAGE TURNS TO WHITE AS...

INT. SAN DIEGO SPORTS ARENA, ALI'S CORNER - WHITE TOWEL

blood into a bucket.

Pacheco looks into his mouth.

Meanwhile, Ali spots...

REFEREE

curious about the activity in Ali's corner, starts over...

PACHECO

nods to Dundee. Dundee starts to reach. Ali snatches

Angelo's hand holding the towel. Angelo's about to end the

fight...

A BELL sounds and Ali goes out to fight in an OVERHEAD SHOT.

INT. SAN DIEGO SPORTS ARENA, ALI AND HIS CORNERMEN +

SECURITY - NIGHT

leave the ring and another defeat, as they move up the aisle

towards the locker room...

INT. ALI'S WOODLAWN AVENUE HOUSE (CHICAGO), LIVING ROOM -

ALI - DAY

watching television. The place is a huge mansion on

Chicago's South Side.

WIDEN TO INCLUDE THE LIVING ROOM WITH BINGHAM, ALI'S

TWINS -- RASHEEDA AND JAMILLAH -- MUHAMMAD, JR. AND MARYUM

OVER ALI:    CONSOLE TV

They watch the Frazier-Foreman fight from Jamaica amid the

wonderful chaos generated by kids and their toys, who crawl

all over Ali as if he were furniture. Frazier and Foreman

are in the center of the ring... We SEE Don King in

Frazier's corner.

Meanwhile, Frazier bobs and weaves, ducks and moves like he

did with Ali. Joe throws a left hook, leaning forward with

it. Before it lands, Foreman unleashes a hard right that

jolts Frazier SIDEWAYS. Frazier throws another hook that

misses. Foreman hits him with a combination of right and

three lefts...two hooks and an uppercut that LIFTS FRAZIER

OFF THE GROUND. Ali leans in to SEE...

ON TV:    THE RING

Frazier stands. The referee does the mandatory eight-count.

Foreman bangs Frazier into the corner and blasts him again.

Frazier tries to muscle out of the corner. Foreman lifts

and throws him back into the corner. Foreman's power is

unreal. Frazier is the man who beat Ali. Now, Frazier

feints and slides sideways, and Foreman hits him in the back

of the head. Frazier goes down again. It is savage. Here

is a new world champion: George Foreman.

INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN (ALI-FRAZIER II) - HANDS + ARMS -

NIGHT

grabbing. Holding. Ali's got Joe's powerful left tied up

this time. A clinch. Separating. A punch. A hook.

Clinching. They separate...

OVER JOE:

Ali, having Joe at the right range, hits him. Joe moves in.

Ali DRAGS him closer and ties him up. They dance...

THEIR BODIES

Ali does a little shuffle, circles to keep Joe at hitting

distance, lands a combination. Joe closes, but Ali won't

let him in and ties up Joe. We hear a BELL and that's the

end of the fight. Not a bang; a whimper.

REFEREE

holds up Ali's hand and mouths silently words we cannot hear.

And as we MOVE CLOSER INTO ALI'S EYES, we see no exaltation.

This is a victory, but a hollow one. It's a decision eked out.

INT. NEW YORK COFFEE SHOP - WIDE

The inner circle:    Ali, Pacheco, Dundee, Bundini, Bingham.

INT. NEW YORK PRESS CONFERENCE - DAY

Ali and Don King hold court with the press. Also there is

George Foreman and his trainer, Dick Sadler, and his manager,

Nilon.

PRESS REACTIONS:

where's Zaire?

King getting really evangelistic...

Ali's looking at him in amazement.

Don King laughs. As the press digs King...MOVE ONTO Foreman,

and here's what's wrong with all of this...we SEE that

Foreman, eight years younger, two inches taller, almost as

fast and seemingly twice as strong, is not beatable by

Muhammad Ali. Foreman just doesn't hurt you, Foreman can

kill you. How is Ali not going to get killed by this man

with death in his eyes and indifference on his face?

Meanwhile...

Ali signs a contract; then Foreman.       Flashbulbs.

Don King bursts out laughing.

EXT. KINSHASA AIRPORT, TARMAC - ROOF - PAST HEADS - DAY

PUSH THROUGH people and SEE an Air Zaire DC-10 pulling in.

A ramp is wheeled up. The plane stops taxiing. Zairian

officials in safari suits, paratroopers with white helmets,

LT. NSAKALA and hundreds of African, European and American

media with cameras and lights approach. The hatch opens. A

ROAR emerges from the right and left. We don't see the source.

INT. AIR ZAIRE DC-10'S - ALI

Belinda's behind him. Bingham's there, Bundini, Angelo

Dundee, Sarria. As they crowd to the door, we're shooting

OVER ALI starting down the ramp. He looks up. We don't see

what he sees. We see only the crowd of people at the foot

of the ramp, including Don King in a dashiki and the crowd

on the tarmac.

FRONTAL:    ALI

looking ABOVE the receiving party. The ROAR again. He

looks side to side, almost distracted from King and the

officials. He waves. Distant CROWD ROAR increases.

They're chanting something. We don't understand the words.

It contains his name. Now...

PAST ALI:    REVEAL A THOUSAND PEOPLE

are beyond the receiving party. They're on the roof of the

airport. They're sitting on balconies and fences. They're

waving their arms. They're on every possible horizontal

surface that can support weight. They're shouting in unison,

a syncopated ROAR...his name and something else. Ali moves

through the receiving party, as if in a trance, to get

through the airport to the other side. Security tries to

keep up...

EXT. AIRPORT ENTRANCE + STREET - ALI

emerges and reacts. He's electrified. Dundee, Bingham, and

a few cops are with him. Everybody else got left behind.

REVEAL 10,000 people are OUTSIDE the airport, cheering his

arrival. Their cheer is thunder.

Ali moves forward. The Zairian Official and four cops fade

back, nervous about being in so large a crowd. The crowd's

a tidal wave, carrying Ali forward, supporting, never

mobbing him.

MUHAMMAD ALI

is overcome. This is all for him. He is their hero. He

defied the world's powerful. They tried and could not

destroy him. His defiance made him their champion. And now

he has come to contest his rightful title against the numb

instrument of the all-powerful. He raises his arm, too, and

shouts...

Ten thousand voices carry it on the wind and take away Ali's

breath.

DON KING, ZAIRIAN OFFICIALS #1 + #2

in the rear realize, as do we, this is NOT MERELY A BOXING

MATCH.

CUT TO:    INT. AIR ZAIRE DC-10 - NIGHT

A towering man in denims with sequins blocks our view of the

door as he walks out onto the ramp. Only now do we see

BEYOND HIM a small welcoming party. Native African dancers,

a big banner that proclaims, "Welcome, George Foreman," the

Zairian paratroopers, media and a few dozen of the curious.

FRONTAL:    GEORGE FOREMAN

looks like "Superfly" on steroids. His entourage follows

him down the ramp. DICK SADLER, tough and smart, is the

Louis Armstrong of trainers. ARCHIE MOORE, crafty and wise,

wears a blue shirt and blue pea-cap.

If George Foreman wonders at the paucity of his reception,

he doesn't let on.

INT. ALI'S HOUSE, N'SELE - ALI - MORNING

sits in EXTREME CLOSE-UP drinking coffee...lost in thought.

He's somewhere else, puzzled, alone in his thoughts. He

wears grey sweatpants, a thin-rubber long-sleeved T-shirt

under his grey sweatshirt. He's oblivious to the Euro-

modern furnishings. Then it's time, and he leaves...

EXT. N'SELE COMPOUND - WIDE:    ALI

enters from his bungalow. We SEE we're in a compound. They

are white and severely truncated houses linked by sidewalks

and too many large street lamps. As Ali starts to jog

through this imitation of suburbia with the scale all wrong.

It's like a Gulag in reverse for the rich and powerful to be

within while keeping the rest of the country out. As Ali

passes, REVEAL we are at the bank of the Congo River. As

Ali starts his predawn run, across the river the first band

of magenta tints the horizon and reflects molten on the water.

TRACKING SHOT:    ALI + DUNDEE, SARRIA IN A PICKUP TRUCK - RED

DAWN

plus two trainers and the ever-present Zairian POLICEMAN, Lt.

Nsakala. The early paints the red-earth ochre.

Ali slides to the right and throws a left jab and hooks off

the jab.

EXT. KINSHASA ROAD - EMPTY ROAD - MORNING LIGHT

Ali ENTERS, running. The road is lined with Mobutu's green

billboards in French and English, proclaiming Zaire

wonderful. A few kids emerge from behind the signs, coming

out from between...and they trail Ali.

And he throws a couple at an imaginary George Foreman.

There are 15 to 16 kids, now.

Curious, Ali runs behind the green signs from where the kids

came.

ALI'S

still jogging. Behind the signs, he becomes a magnetic

attraction. People are surprised to see Ali. He's making

their day. Euphoric kids parallel him, run with him, follow

him...

PAST ALI:

the concrete-and-cinder-block walls to the dusty, bare

ground are chromatic. Primary colors. Ethnographically

interesting.

ALI SEES interiors. Broken walls. No roof. No plumbing.

People come from a ditch with a shower curtain for privacy,

surprised to see Ali. Faces indifferent to squalor. This

is the ethnographically "interesting" surface of what, in

fact, is civic disintegration starting to occur... It is

the human concomitant to 13 years of Mobutu kleptocracy.

ALI

looks at the backs of the signs. He and we realize the

signs' purpose: to hide the makeshift plastic walls and

rooms made from cardboard containers and oil drums from the

foreigners traveling the road to Kinshasa. One TEENAGER

WITH A WITHERED ARM and a big smile runs up...

He mimes knocking out Foreman. Something powerful is

affecting Ali. We don't know what it is. Ali slows down...

...throws two lightning jabs and a hook. Ali reaches to the

kid's head and pulls a coin. He flips it to another kid and

walks on. A SECOND TEENAGER comes out and wants Ali to look

at something around the back. He takes Ali's hand...and

holds it. Ali complies. The entourage follows...

AROUND CORNER:   KIDS' PAINTING ON WALL

It's an imitation fight poster. Childlike caricatures in

Basquiat-like brush strokes. Foreman's got crosses for eyes.

He's out! Ali is victorious! His fist is raised. His

cartoon face shouts his victory...the people's champion.

There's more. There's knocked-out white policemen, knocked-

out black soldiers, knocked-out landlords, knocked-out South

Africa, knocked-out planes and tanks, knocked-out tse-tse

flies...everything!

So much, it means "ALL"...all expectation. This childish

painting powerfully affects Ali. The kids look at him.

It's still. Some kids in the back leap up in the air to see

over taller heads what Ali's doing.

ALI

looks at individual faces. A grinning OLDER MAN with a blue

transistor radio (we'll see him later). A smiling kid. A

girl with no shoes. A teenage kid jumping up and down...all

looking at him. Ali makes four pieces of rope appear. He

rubs them together...

They become one. Everybody goes nuts. As Ali leaves, his

eyes go back to the people and the painting...

EXT. KINSHASA ROAD - ECU:   ALI'S FACE - MORNING (GREEN SCREEN)

Concentration has taken him into the athlete's zone, the

state of unified awareness wherein dwells his total self-

knowledge. And he knows the transaction: what they give

him with their adoration, which he converts to power, is in

exchange for what he means to them. And what he means to

them is specific: he represents them in defying power and

vanquishing what oppresses. He validates the existence of

expectation, that struggle is possible...George Foreman,

mute and unknowingly, represents disinterested power. Ali

doesn't "accept" his obligation; he embraces it. It is his

purpose, revealed. And he will never waver from it.

INT. INTERCONTINENTAL HOTEL, ANTEROOM (KINSHASA) - ALI - DAY

waits, sitting on a table edge in a corridor. Noise of a

press conference setting. Howard Cosell crosses through,

smoking. Bingham enters and gestures...they're ready. Ali

waves off Bingham, stops Cosell...

No one thinks Ali will win.

INT. INTERCONTINENTAL HOTEL, MEDIA CONFERENCE ROOM - CLOSE:

ALI - DAY

We've jammed into the middle of Ali in a blast of braggadocio.

Laughter.

Anticipatory laughter. They've had twelve years' experience

of Ali's stand-up and know when a new routine's starting...

Laughter.

There it is. Has doubt, spoken truthfully in the open,

closed the mouth of Muhammad Ali? A beat. Then...

The assembled media crack up.    Ali's eyes are wide in mock

amazement.

CLOSE:    COSELL

A bittersweet smile and the eye contact with Ali.    Cosell

knows...

INT. GYM FLOOR - HEAVY BAG - LATE AFTERNOON

is slammed by a massive fist. It leaves a dent the size of

a deflated basketball. The fist is George Foreman's.

DICK SADLER

holds the bag. Foreman throws hooks, one after the other.

Each blow rocks Sadler. George is literally punching a hole

in the bag. These blows would mash an opponent's liver,

break ribs, destroy kidneys. This man can do more than hurt

you. This man can kill you.

INT. RING - FOREMAN + SPARRING PARTNER - LATER

Foreman   is boxing a middleweight. He is smaller than

Foreman   and, therefore, faster. And, that's the point. The

partner   tries to circle, slide, dance away, and Foreman cuts

him off   and drives him to the ropes where he tags him. He

doesn't   put a lot behind it. Partner slides...

FOREMAN

darts left and jars him with three left jabs, keeping him on

the rope. Foreman's training to defeat Ali's dancing, his

"float + sting" tactics.

CLOSE:   GEORGE FOREMAN

is young, has unreal power and he can move.

INT. TRAINING COMPOUND - METAL GRILL DOORS:    ALI'S ENTOURAGE

is entering. Lieutenant Nsakala is there, too. They time-

share the facility. Foreman's entourage with conga drummers

are exiting. Ali and Foreman are never closer than 10 feet

apart. Foreman says nothing. Ali starts banging his hands

on Foreman's conga and shouts over the percussion at Foreman...

SIDE ANGLE:   THE TWO ENTOURAGES

pass. Comparatively, Foreman looks bigger. He is more

dense of bone. He's taller. His chest seems deeper and his

shoulders wider.

AND FOREMAN'S EXPRESSION

is casual, unrattled by Ali's antics. He is menacing in his

indifference. It means he's ALSO immune to getting psyched

out by Ali.

INT. RING - CROWD - LATER

Bundini's in Ali's corner. Ali's sparring partner is Larry

Holmes. Ali's hands are at his side. He dances, bicycles,

shuffles, dances, dodges, doesn't throw anything, his elbows

at his side. Ali is training to DANCE from Foreman. He's

fast, but not seemingly suspended in air as he was 10 long

years ago against Liston.

INT. N'SELE COMPOUND, ALI'S HOUSE - BELINDA - MORNING

They eat it.

You're seeing what you want to see,

Muhammad...

Mobutu eats it...

Mobutu is taking care of Mobutu and

stealing all the wealth and sending

it to Switzerland...

So? What's that do with any of why

we here?

We're here 'cause Don King got

Mobutu to put up ten million

dollars. Don King don't give a

damn about Africa. He worse than

Herbert.

Here come "Herbert."

Yeah. 'Cause where was he when we

was broke and borrowing money? And

Bundini and all them that "love

you"? Disappeared, is where they

were.

All over you when you got it and

drop off you when you don't...

Money? I do "money-making"

whenever I want. Money is easy.

And Don King fit right in...that

double-breasted hipster is now a

dashiki-wearing rip-off.

Don King delivered the first black-

promoted championship fight in Africa!

He won't.    Ali picks up his bag and starts out...

He walks out the door.

EXT. KINSHASA ARENA - 75 ZAIRIAN TRIBAL DANCERS - NIGHT

to percussion.      The number.

ALI,

Angelo and Bingham in the empty seating, looking at the ring

under the canopy. Behind them is the rehearsal. Meanwhile...

EXT. ARENA, ENTRANCE - TWO CARS

arrive, including in the first an Interpreter, Zairian

Official #2, a Policeman Driver; and in the second car is

Don King, Herbert, VERONICA, and another American Woman

(silent bit). They're in a hurry...

EXT. ARENA - ALI

is being taught to dance by two dancers. They fail. In the

background, workers are raising gigantic Mobutu portraits.

The Pointer Sisters begin.

AISLE

Don King and entourage approach.

Pointer Sisters start "Yes, We Can Can."

Ali laughs.

Pointer Sisters' rehearsal cuts...re-organizes.

Pointer Sisters probably end here.   After a beat, percussion

starts up. Dancers drift in.

We see Herbert watching all of this closely...particularly

the challenge to Ali/Dundee.

INT. PRESS CONFERENCE

Don King laughs, nervously.   Ali is daring George to stay.

Media laugh, Don King goes along, Ali continues...

It's Ali kidding on the square. A serious point delivered

not seriously to be taken seriously.

BUNDINI thinks of a line and whispers it to Don.   Don leans

past Dundee to pass it on Ali.

His eyes flash.   He leans forward and puts a finger in Don

King's face.

Ali ain't fucking around. Ali has reasons for working with

Don. Belittling Angelo cuts across all that. Danger's in

the air. Dundee puts his hands up.

Ali pulls out a comb and starts to comb his hair.

Ali being mercurial is unexpected by Don. Laughter from

particularly the women as he combs his hair and segues...

Ali's served notice to anyone with ears to hear it: he's

multidimensional, strategic and dangerous as hell. A taste

of what's to come.

EXT. VERANDA - ALI, BUNDINI, BINGHAM + ANGELO - DAY

Waiters scurry. Ali talks to a blonde reporter from France

and settles next to Lloyd Price, without a shirt. Everyone

crowds around their table. A ZAIRIAN INTERPRETER and

Lieutenant Nsakala are present. Ali disregards their

presence because his attention tracks...

ALI'S POV:   VERONICA

seen over the heads of Zairians. She's 5 feet 10 inches

tall. Without acknowledging she's the object of Ali's

attention, her radar tells her she's the object of Ali's

attention.

Veronica turns, sees Ali.    Lights up.

OVER VERONICA as she makes her way to the table by Ali's

side, where he takes her hand in his.

He steers her into the chair next to him, which is

immediately vacated by Lloyd Price.

The others are paying them no attention. Bundini stands to

talk to Howard Cosell. There's an ocean of side

conversations. Ali's presentation to Veronica is natural,

open admiring. It is not seduction. It's more seductive

than seduction. She feels from Ali nothing predatory or

exploitative...only the warm rays of the sun from his open

face and appreciating eyes. Still holding her hand...

Meanwhile, George Foreman, with Sadler, Moore, Broadus, sees

and laughs at Ali and Veronica and onto George Foreman going

into hotel.

Meanwhile, 15 Chinese and some Vietnamese approach and wait

patiently. Ali has to force his attention away from

Veronica to respond... They all bow. He bows.

The Zairian Interpreter translates English to French to

another Zairian, who speaks Mandarin. It all gets lost in

chaos while Bingham shoots pictures and a Plimpton type

explains pedantically to Bundini...

The eyes of some of the Asians are very emotional. Ali

stands up and bows to them. Chinese bow themselves away.

Ruth Pointer arrives. Ali kisses her. She sits, but talks

to Bingham.

Veronica laughs as Ali mocks swooning over her...   Another

news crew arrives.

EXT. KINSHASA SHANTYTOWN - KIDS - DUSK INTO NIGHT

and old people, teenagers in dirty T-shirts with strange

hats. Their eyes are wide.

REVERSE:   ALI

shows his bare hands. Now he rubs them together and

MAGICALLY pulls from his closed fist a colored scarf.     The

kids scream.

VERONICA

squints, trying to figure out how he did it, because...

ALI

shows the scarf, pushes back his cuffs so that he can't hide

anything up his sleeves. His wrists are bare. He shows

both sides. Now, he takes the scarf and pushes with his

right hand and feeds it into the closed fist of his left.

He looks up wide-eyed at everybody. Then, he opens his

fingers and the scarf is not there!

ALI + VERONICA

walk, towering over the kids. One girl holds Ali's hand.

The others maintain a respectful proximity so that they

don't invade the space around Ali.

They pass through cinder-block houses, shipping crates, oil

drums for cooking fires, a few car parts.

Veronica laughs. She brings his hand up to her mouth and

kisses it. Hand in hand, a towering man and a towering

woman walk away at their ease against the soft sky with

their entourage of teenagers and kids. On the perimeter, a

kid does flips and, then, gets distracted...

INT. N'SELE GYM - SPEED BAG - DAY

A syncopated, obscuring, blurred shape of the bag turned

into a percussion instrument by Ali's fast hands trying to

get even faster.

Ali SLAMS a right hook at the bag. It almost explodes.

OPTIONAL: Ali takes body hits, tries sliding off head shots.

INT. RING - ALI'S EYES

feints his left and throws a right.   It surprises Holmes.

Ali sees something beyond the ring. And, now, flicks four

ripping left jabs into Holmes and slides sideways as Holmes

tries to catch Ali with a right. But Ali changes directions,

changes back and now comes over Holmes' right with his own

left cross, and a six-or-seven-punch combination. It is Ali

dancing and floating. Crowd cheers..."TIME."

BUNDINI

meanwhile, has thrown his arms around Dick Sadler, Foreman's

manager. (We realize this is why Ali segued from serious

work to snapping his traditional left jab.)

Sadler's there with his wife and another couple. Rudy joins,

laughing. Bundini turns loose Sadler. Ali and Sadler like

each other.

Sadler affectionately puts an arm around Ali's neck and

reaches up and pretends to hit Ali on top of the head with a

fist for Bingham's camera. Ali bites his lower lip and

starts wrestling with Sadler, putting him in a headlock.

Sadler's arm is around Ali's waist.

More laughter.     Sadler's beret falls off.   Rudy puts it back on.

The gang laughs.

Throughout the above he's pretending to jab at Dick, who's

laughing and feinting at him. It's raucous. Fond

relationships transcend the adversarial roles. They are all

of the tribe of boxers. Sadler is a particularly bright and

talented man. Meanwhile...

INT. COMPOUND, OTHER SIDE OF THE RING - AN OLDER BRADLEY

accompanied by an American Reporter is nabbed by a French

news crew.

He walks away.

EDGE OF THE RING:   ANGELO DUNDEE

sits on the apron of the ring.      Ali joins him.

EXT. COMPOUND - SADLER - DAY

leaving, steals a glance at Ali and Dundee. It's adversarial.

The camaraderie was not false. Both are true. But being

strategic, he is a threat to Ali. George has a first-rate team.

INT. INTERCONTINENTAL, ALI'S SUITE - ALI - DAY

enters with Howard Cosell and Howard Bingham and a two-man

news crew.

Belinda starts towards the bedroom. Ali looks to Howard and

gestures with his hand to get rid of everybody. As the

bedroom door closes, Cosell, crew and Bingham can't wait to

get out of there.

INT. INTERCONTINENTAL SUITE, BEDROOM - DAY

Belinda slams a lamp standing next to her.

Belinda pauses.   A terrible question occurs to her.

Ali doesn't answer.

Ali looks at her a moment. Then he leaves. Silence.

Belinda sits on the bed. She looks up. Then she comes

apart. She rips open a closet. She finds Veronica's

clothes, rips them, shreds peignoirs, overturns a night

table, strips the bed, smashes more furniture, throws

Veronica's suitcase at the mirror. It does not break. She

looks around the wrecked room. Bingham is standing there.

Belinda looks up, tears in her eyes.

INT. ALI'S HOUSE, N'SELE, SHOWER - ALI - NIGHT

under the water. It flows like silver down the contours of

his face and neck. He is in that zone of concentration

where the best athletes go...where the pre-motor cortex's

activity dominates and facial expression becomes blank, eyes

look distantly...Ali's in his domain...in the groove.

EXT. COMPOUND, N'SELE, REAR SHOT:   ALI'S CITROEN - NIGHT

and outriders depart.

INT. MOBUTU'S PALACE, A SITTING ROOM - SERVANTS - NIGHT

prepare a luxurious setting. On a platform is a large TV

set. In front of it, with low tables are two large

armchairs with antimacassars. At the door are Mobutu's

spit-and-polish paratrooper bodyguards. They STOMP their

feet to attention as...

MOBUTU

in his tan uniform and signature leopard-skin hat enters,

followed by an entourage of aides.

INT. ALI'S DRESSING ROOM - DUNDEE

wrapping Ali's hands, tears the tape into narrow strips to

go between the fingers. Doc Broadus, from Foreman's camp,

observes the wrapping, then signs it. In addition to

function, the taping feels ritualistic.

CLOSE:    ALI'S

attention is focused elsewhere...on his action:    what he

will do, his strategy.

Ali gets off the training table. Angelo has finished. He

puts on his robe and starts warming up before the mirror,

throwing punches for a full minute.

HERBERT

enters.    Ali and Herbert go to an alcove.

Sarria sticking sealed bottles filled with honey, orange

juice and water into the water bucket. As Ali puts on the

robe, the others gather up the gear, start out. Herbert

moves to Ali, preparing for the entrance, to be as close to

him for the cameras as possible...

Herbert and Pat Patterson, the bodyguard, with his chrome-

plated .45, follow the others away from Ali. Angelo begins

applying Vaseline on Ali's face. They're alone in the room.

Ali loosens up his neck.

Ali looks at Dundee enigmatically.     Before Angelo can ask...

BUNDINI

throws towels across Ali's shoulders. Ali puts on his long

African robe, which is white with African-graphic trim on

the cuffs of the sleeves and the hem.

Ali nods to him.

WIDE FROM ABOVE:   ALI'S CAMP

starts moving towards the door. They open the door. It is

guarded by a handpicked squad of paratroopers and Lieutenant

Nsakala.

INT. CORRIDOR

Paratroopers on either side like a wedge, guarding Ali with

Angelo, Bundini, Rudy and Herbert, as they push through the

door, out into the hall.

TRAVEL WITH THEM AS

people in the corridor at the end see Ali.       The chant begins...

The sound from the corridor picks up a second reverberation

that booms from a distant vast space. As we move towards it,

to encounter it. And suddenly we...

BURST OUT INTO THE STADIUM...

EXT. KINSHASA ARENA - WIDE:     EVERYTHING - NIGHT

Lights flood it.   They pour down artificial sunshine.

ROARS from 65,000 voices at a quarter to four in the morning.

The moon is out, revealing storm clouds.

HIGH + WIDE SHOTS:        ALI

and entourage.      The crowd goes nuts.

TRAVELING WITH ALI THROUGH THE MASS

The crowd roars; Angelo behind, Bundini on one side, Pacheco

and Sarria.

EXT. RING - WE ENTER

They cheer. Ali raises his hand and salutes them. Ali

dances from one end of the ring to the other...dances into

George's corner... The crowd roars.

ANOTHER ANGLE:      ALI

dances back to his corner...

Ali laughs. You won't psyche out Muhammad Ali with that

stuff. Instead, Ali uses the time. He tests the ropes. He

gets the feel of the distance between the center and the corner.

CLOSER:   ALI

circles the ring. He looks at the crowd from different

angles, from the corner, the center... He looks up at the

lights and gets used to the heat from them.

ALI'S FEET

do a shuffle. He feels the canvas. He feels the soft spots.

The firm spots. He feels how much slide there is because of

the resin on the canvas, how much spring there is in the

boards...

ALI

sheds his robe, now, and throws a blistering array of jabs

and hooks. The crowd goes nuts. Ali looks ringside and sees...

ALI'S POV:      JIM BROWN

Lloyd Price...further along...Robert Lipsyte.

EXT. ARENA - AISLE - SUDDENLY

out comes Foreman in his red robe, Archie Moore following in

his blue pea-cap, and Dick Sadler -- never a fashion

plate -- in the world's least-attractive T-shirt, followed

by former featherweight champ Sandy Saddler.

THE RING - ALI

is shadowboxing as Foreman climbs in the ring and crosses

past him, near to him. The look on Ali's face is indifferent.

Foreman goes immediately to his stool. He doesn't move

around the ring. He doesn't touch the ropes.

DON KING

as tall as only three other men: Foreman, Ali and Bundini,

walks into the ring wearing black...

ZACK CLAYTON,

the referee, moves to the center of the ring.      A great roar

fills the air: "ALI, BOMA YE! ALI, BOMA YE!        ALI, BOMA

YE!"...another one. "FOREMAN! FOREMAN!"

OVERHEAD

as Ali, Foreman and both their crews meet in the center of

the ring.

George's eyes glare.    Ali rocks back and forth, ready to rumble.

Foreman is unfazed by all of this.    His cold eyes say

"battery and homicide."

Ali turns his back and continues to shuffle and shadowbox.

OVERHEAD:    ALI + FOREMAN'S

corners are clear. Ali is facing his corner, praying to

Allah. Foreman is bent over at the waist, flexing and

releasing the last tension in his huge shoulders, as the

bell for ROUND ONE clangs...

THE RING - BOTH

charge out and stop as if they ran into a brick wall five

feet from each other. Then Ali dips, throws a left, which

George takes on the shoulder...a BIG RIGHT HAND to George's

head. The crowd goes nuts. George clinches, picks up Ali

and swings him through 180 degrees with his power. As he

puts Ali down, Ali pushes George's head down and away and

Ali clocks him with ANOTHER RIGHT. Foreman clinches and

drives Ali back to the rope. Ali throws ANOTHER RIGHT that

lands. Ali dances, circles, stays out of Foreman's way.

Then he slams him again with a right.

Foreman gets Ali in the corner, throws vicious combinations

and a hook that nails Ali in the body and a wild shot hits

Ali on the side of the head. CLOSER ON ALI...stunned, his

eyes clear. He's just taken a Foreman shot. He pushes

Foreman, the stronger man, out of the way and dances and

circles. Foreman ties him up again. Ali pushes out, dances

and hits HIM with a RIGHT. Ali ties him up, and there's the

BELL.

ALI'S CORNER:     ALI

SLOWLY MOVE IN ON ALI

as Angelo and Bundini's talk fades away. We see Ali's

awareness in a deep concentration. He is holding counsel

with himself. Ali stares into space across the diagonal to

the other corner, but not really at Foreman. Ali is

weighing something. A gamble. He blinks, and whatever it

is, he's decided it NOW. AMBIENT SOUND starts to come back

as Ali's attention returns to the present and he ignores...

THE BELL FOR ROUND TWO

Ali charges into the center of the ring, provoking Foreman

to chase him, and Ali immediately BACKS TO THE ROPE. And

stays there! Seizing opportunity, Foreman throws big hooks.

ALI IS DOING EXACTLY WHAT HE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO DO. He gets

off the rope and backs to the rope on the other side. Most

of the shots are blocked by the gloves of both men. No

damage. Then George throws a left, which Ali blocks, and a

big right hook.

ALI

turns away.     Nevertheless, it crashes into his jaw.

MACRO ALI

TIME SLOWS. He ties up George. We SEE Ali's hurt.        Dazed.

But he must make George believe he's unhurt.

Foreman reacts. Ali takes vicious hooks to the midsection,

hangs on and goes right back onto the ropes, tying Foreman up.

LOW ANGLE

George's shots are taken on Ali's elbows and gloves. But

for every four that are thrown, one or two tremendous hooks

get through to Ali's ribs, his side.

ALI'S FACE

reveals impact, but nothing diminishes the TERRIBLE

FORTITUDE with which he endures. Now, he ties up George.

Now, George drives Ali into the corner and pummels him.

ANGELO + BUNDINI

going crazy in the corner!

Ali blocking, getting hit.   WORRIED FACES in the crowd.       One

woman looks away.

ALI'S EYES

alive, more than alert, the sharpest eyes in boxing.

FOREMAN'S LEFT JAB

coming in.   Ali feints, shifts.   It misses by a quarter of

an inch.

FOREMAN HOOKS OFF HIS JAB

Ali leans back on the top rope. Foreman's punch falls short

and connects with little effect. That's how good is Ali.

The techniques BECOME CLEAR.

Foreman goes upstairs, throws three hooks, all get taken on

Ali's gloves. Foreman slams a hook that began in Cape Town

and ends up in Zaire, into Ali's abdomen. And another. Ali

takes the shots, hangs on.

ALI'S EYES

are bright like stars.   His white mouth guard shines.     A

grimace? A grin?

Ali pushes Foreman off and Ali connects with a left and a

straight right to the jaw. They pound but don't stop George.

Ali ties him up. Ali's jabs end the round. Nothing

effective, but Ali shakes his head, disapprovingly, puts his

hand on the back of George's neck, and as the BELL sounds...

George laughs.   He won the round overwhelmingly.

ALI'S CORNER

is apoplectic.

Ali pushes away from his handlers and rises. He opens his

arms to the crowd. We hear a massive "ALI, BOMA YE" start up.

CLOSER:   ALI

opens his arms as if the roar of 65,000 voices is sunlight.

By opening his arms, his skin soaks it in and converts it to

power. And the BELL STARTS ROUND THREE.

EXT. THE RING

They trade. Nothing. Foreman advances, Ali backs to the

ropes, tags Foreman with a couple of harmless left jabs.

Now Foreman opens up with heavy artillery. Ali gets in a

couple of shots, but for the center of the round he's

pummeled by Foreman. Midway through...

FOREMAN accepts a left jab, and while Ali's left arm is out

with it, Foreman hammers a right into the exposed lower

midsection of Ali and then follows it with six tremendous

hooks to Ali's abdomen. Ali pushes him away. Foreman comes

in again. Foreman gets him on the rope again, and a

surprising right on the left side of Ali's face.

ALI

ties up Foreman's left in the crook of his elbow, and they

stagger, married, awkwardly, into the center of ring. The

referee separates them.

ANOTHER ANGLE:     FOREMAN

charging and throwing heavy shots. Ali takes some on his

elbows, arms, biceps and shoulders. NOW we see Ali lean

BACK. WAY BACK. 45 degrees back... We start to hear the

TWANG of the rope. We get it. Ali is using the rope as a

shock absorber. Some Foreman punches get through, but the

rope TWANGS and Foreman's hitting a trampoline with a hammer.

Between deflection and being ring-wise, Ali dilutes much of

what George throws. Then Foreman drives three powerful

hooks into Ali's side.

ALI'S BODY SPASMS

But, as if inconsequential...

Ali -- insulting, taunting -- snaps jabs into George's face,

talking through his mouthpiece...

UP CLOSER:   ALI

blocks a rage of Foreman head shots with his fists, the

abdominal shots within his elbows. Each Foreman punch is a

haymaker.

FOREMAN

suddenly switches.

FROM THE FLOOR:     FOREMAN'S UPPERCUT

comes from camera and slams right through Ali's guard, right

into his jaw.

ALI'S

hurt!     He holds on.

Ali's pushed back like a rag doll.

FOREMAN

throws a right hand.     It, too, slams through Ali's guard.

He's in trouble.

ALI'S EYES

flash.     Roll in his head.   He sees neon.   TIME SLOWS...lights

dim...

Ali glances at the crowd. He SEES: the OLD MAN with the

transistor radio on his shoulder from the shantytown, urging

him on!

THE RING:     FOREMAN

slams shots into Ali's kidneys, his ribs. Ali will piss

blood for two months. But Ali stays on the ropes. AS TIME

CATCHES UP TO NORMAL...

ALI comes off the rope, and Ali hits Foreman with a terrific

three-shot combination, a right-left-right. WHAM-WHAM-WHAM.

Feints.   Hits Foreman with a left-right.   WHAM-WHAM!

The BELL. It's an Ali rally at the end. He throws Foreman

a look of contempt as he walks to his corner.

ALI'S CORNER

Ali looks to the left and sees Jim Brown.

Jim Brown laughs.

WE DON'T HEAR A BELL. INSTEAD, WE'RE SUDDENLY IN THE LAST 15

SECONDS OF ROUND FOUR.

EXT. RING, ROUND FOUR, FIVE, SIX - FOREMAN BARRAGE

Ali is braced on the ropes, as far back as the ropes will go.

Foreman throws a barrage of shots, he slams in five and six

at a time. THE BELL.

ALI

covers with gloves at his head. Elbows at his ribs. When

head shots come in, Ali slips them the right or left, or

turns them into glancing shots, or just leans straight back

so that they all fall short by quarter of an inch. The BELL.

ALI

covering, taking the most powerful hooks Foreman's thrown in

the fight, one after the other to the body.

Ali's eyes are stars. He sees everything. He sees things

no one else can see in the quantum physics of deflecting the

force of Foreman's blows.

FOREMAN

desperate, pounds a left to Ali's side, a blocked left to

the head, three lefts to the belly, which get through!

Ali's left arm convulses downwards, involuntarily, with the

blows. What Ali's not ready for and doesn't block is the

right hand that follows. This shot is jarring and concussive.

He grabs Foreman's neck and has to hold on.

The BELL.

EXT. RING - ALI - MID-ROUND SEVEN

leaning way back at impossible angles -- soaking up George's

shots. George is SLOWER...BUT Ali's not throwing at all!

Then...Ali comes out from under.

WHAM.     WHAM.     WHAM.   WHAM.     WHAM.

Five hard shots are followed into Foreman's puffed face.

They surprise and enrage him.

WIDER:     GEORGE

drives Ali with his 220 pounds...George's arms and fists now

SWING HEAVILY. Some get through. Ali's right eye is puffy.

Both tie up. And BELL ends the round.

EXT. RING - ALI'S CORNER

Angelo and Bundini talk.            Neither we nor Ali hear them.

A tall African Girl walks by with the number "8." As she

passes near Ali, she has the audacity to wink at him. ALI

happens to see it. He winks back at her. She smiles. He

brightens right up! THE BELL RINGS.

EXT. RING - ALI

goes to the ropes, throws a couple and, now, comes off the

ropes. He's in the center of the ring. HE'S HUNTING. A

couple of lefts from Ali. Foreman throws a haymaker and

almost falls out of the ring. Ali's in the corner, having

avoided the shot.

FOREMAN

gets in a couple of lefts that Ali deflects. Ali takes

another on the cheek, leans way back again. Suddenly, he

seems tired, as is Foreman. Tied up, they go diagonally to

the other corner of the ring, both fighters exhausted,

leaning against each other. Resting. BUT...

EXTREMELY CLOSE:   WE SEE ALI'S EYES ARE DEAD SHARP

He's faking.

FOREMAN

backs Ali into the corner.

ALI

hits Foreman with a left. Foreman launches a short left

that Ali counters with a BIG RIGHT CROSS that connects.

FOREMAN'S

head snaps around. Sweat sprays in a parabola of light.

Crowd ROARS with expectation. George Foreman tries a right

uppercut, fails as Ali circles, guiding Foreman onto the

ropes. Foreman's on the ropes NOW.

ALI'S EYES

know the moment is...

ALI'S

short, chopping right turns Foreman's head down.

CLOSER:   FOREMAN

comes over the ropes and turns back into...

ALI'S RIGHT HOOK

slams his head down and sideways.   And Foreman charges into Ali.

CLOSE SLO-MO:   ALI

snaps a combination: an overhead right to Foreman's face, a

short chopping left and a right hook. Ali's eyes light up

like white phosphorus.

FOREMAN

wrestles Ali into the center.   And the most significant

moments begin...

SLO-MO:   ALI ON THE LEFT + FOREMAN ON THE RIGHT

...and Ali's left hand is extended way behind him with the

wrist bent, no power. As it passes his body, Ali converts

it into a left hook. As he's doing this, he's dropping his

left foot back. The left foot DOES NOT support a left hand.

It's for a right hand so the body can untorque across with

the punch. And Ali is already cocking his right. Meanwhile,

the left connects with Foreman's jaw and raises his chin.

As the left is departing Foreman's chin, Ali launches the RIGHT.

SLO-MO:   AS ALI'S RIGHT HAND

comes in, Ali's torso untorques, transitioning all 217

pounds to Ali's left foot and putting that weight and power

behind his right fist that crashes into George Foreman's

chin...and the impact transfers to Foreman's skull...and

Foreman's head snaps around. He is gone. He is falling in

a spiral...a metaphor for vertigo...turning downward into

unconsciousness. And through the spiral, Ali has moved with

him, pivoting with the falling Foreman, his right fist

cocked to unload again if he has to. He never does...

MASSIVE OVERHEAD:   FOREMAN

down. Ali is pushed into the corner by referee Zack Clayton.

Foreman is counted out. Clayton raises Ali's hand. 65,000

people go crazy!

TOTAL CHAOS

Ali is seized by Rahaman, Dundee, Bundini. And in the

corner, hardly seen by anybody, Ali, now, faints. Veronica,

with a DON KING AIDE, is overcome. Tears stream down her face.

EXT. THE ARENA

As if finally released from the suspense, the sky opens.

The monsoon begins.

EXT. THE STREETS OF KINSHASA, OUTSIDE THE STADIUM, ZAIRIANS -

NIGHT

celebrate. The city is crazy with the air of liberation in

the rain. People are drunk, bowing to one another,

extending their arms and legs in strange gestures. Laughter.

THUNDER is deafening in the downpour. People celebrate

despite the storm, dancing on sidewalks on Rua Absini.

EXT. KINSHASA ARENA - NIGHT

Almost empty. The downpour.   The last fans rip down one

gigantic image of Mobutu...

INT. MOBUTU'S PALACE - THREE MEN

waiting, now rise. One, in Saville Row, is from a London

Bank. The other is Bradley, the USIA/CIA character. The

third is Idi Amin of Uganda. As everybody shakes hands,

they sit down and servants appear. Everyone is pleased with

themselves...

INT. CITROEN ON KINSHASA ROAD - ALI - NIGHT

rides through the downpour with Belinda and Bingham in the

front seat. She gently holds, almost supports his hand.

They drive through a fishing village with dense foliage in

part. Ali looks, sees...

ALI'S POV:   WOMEN + SOME MEN

have brought their children out into the rain to see the

champion so they can say when they grow up they saw him pass

by. Plastic or clothing protect the children from the rain.

One man holds up his son. Ali rolls down the window.

INT. INTERCONTINENTAL HOTEL, BAR - DICK SADLER

shouting French to the bartender. Folks who look like Jim

Brown, Schulberg/Mailer types...hang out, half drunk...and

argue about flights out with extortionate petty bureaucrats

like Zairian Official #2. Flights have been cancelled,

tickets rendered no good, passports confiscated, etc.

There's a stoned Hunter Thompson/Bill Cardoso type with a

couple of Zairian hookers. The Hunter Thompson type is not

very discreetly smoking Congolese weed.

REVEAL:     IN THE BACK CORNER OF THE BAR ARE...

DON KING + HERBERT MUHAMMAD.

King is importuning Herbert, his hands work the air,

gesticulating madly, building whole castles of hype and

hustle. We can't hear what he's saying. Herbert listens.

Then Don King stops and looks at him, and Herbert nods his

head "yes." Then Herbert starts saying something and Don

King nods his head "yes." Whatever's happening here, a deal

for the future has been struck.

EXT. ALI'S COMPOUND, N'SELE - ALI - PRE-DAWN

Rain stopped. The cold, blue light is illuminated with

magenta at its base as dawn starts to rise over the Congo River.

WIDE:     ALI

in a pale green shirt and slacks, walks towards the water,

followed by Zairians, teenagers, some kids who snuck into

the compound, two older men. No media; no elite; no hype.

One policeman who staggers, drunk. Ali doesn't so much as

walk to a destination as amble. He rubs the head of a 12-

year-old boy who starts shadowboxing five feet in front of him.

Ali begins to spar with the 12-year-old, who is fast and

knows a little bit about boxing.

Kid throws a punch.     Ali collapses to his knees.

Some laughter. Then Ali stands and puts his hand on the

boy's shoulder. He ambles with the group towards the river.

The sun's coming up on the other side.
