Laughter from the camera CREW..

CLOUGH's interview continues on a TV in a sitting-room, where

it is being watched by Don Revie, sitting in an armchair...

CLOUGH continues...

REVIE continues to watch the TV...

MITCHELL looks up at CLOUGH...

DON REVIE's eyes burn with indignation. He picks up a

telephone, and angrily starts to dial..

Here they are. The Leeds PLAYERS. Long hair and long faces.

Surly. Truculent. Dangerous.

Out on the practice pitch. In the rain. Some doing warm-up

exercises. Others milling dangerously in groups. Their names

on their purple track suits.

HUNTER, LORIMER, GILES, BATES, GRAY, CLARKE, BREMNER, MCQUEEN

CLOUGH's car pulls up. He and his sons get out. A few waiting

press. Cameras. Lights. A few FANS with autograph books.

JIMMY GORDON, CLOUGH loyal trainer, his face creased with

anxiety..

CLOUGH reaches the door..

She gasps..

CLOUGH puts his arms protectively round the BOYS, and leads

them out of the door. JEAN REID stares, visibly shaken.

Half-a-dozen white-haired patriarchs sit at a large table.

Matching blazers and matching brass. MANNY CUSSINS, SAM

BOLTON, BOB ROBERTS, SYDNEY SIMON, PERCY WOODWARD.

Aldermen and Rotary club members. Masons and businessmen.

CLOUGH enters the boardroom. Indicates to JIMMY GORDON to

look after the BOYS outside. Inside: matching curtains and

carpets.

CLOUGH sits down at the head of the table. Rubs his hands

together..

The DIRECTORS shoot looks at one another.

The room falls silent. That got everyone's attention.

The blazers and brass buttons, WHITE-HAIRED ELDERS of Leeds

stare at one another.

CLOUGH sits glued to a wireless in his front room.

CLOUGH's eyes widen: he calls out to the others..

CAPTION: "SIX YEARS EARLIER"

PETER TAYLOR, seven years older than CLOUGH, his closest

friend, his only true friend, appears breathlessly in the

doorway back from a fish and chips run...

..followed by BARBARA, Clough's wife, and the three

children..

ON TV: the BLAZER-WEARING ELDER calls into the microphone..

CLOUGH and TAYLOR cry out in shock..

The telephone rings. CLOUGH picks it up..

He's right. It's SAM LONGSON, Chairman of Derby County,

(60's) looks like Krushchev, cue-ball head, voice like a

power-drill, a tough haulage millionaire..

CLOUGH hangs up the phone..

General excitement. Everyone starts putting on their coats.

CLOUGH stands with two men in overalls, indicating a fading

`Visitors' sign...

`Crash', the following morning, CLOUGH bursts through swing

doors, and into corridors with the CLEANERS...

CLOUGH inspects the pitch with the HEAD GROUNDSMAN..

The Derby PLAYERS train on a football pitch in a public park.

CLOUGH turns to TAYLOR..

CLOUGH in early. Before anyone. In shirtsleeves, sweeping

corridors. Straightens photos on the wall.

CLOUGH polishing the sign, `VISITORS' on the dressing-room

door.

CLOUGH on his knees, scrubbing, cleaning baths in the

visiting team's washrooms.

CLOUGH puts on his suit. Ties his tie. He takes a bottle of

vintage red wine from a cupboard.

He places the bottles on his desk. Then puts two cut crystal

glasses on his desk. His and Don's.

A flicker of jealousy on PETER TAYLOR's face, almost like a

wife - hurt that his friend is making such an effort for

someone else.

A knock on the door. JIMMY GORDON appears in the doorway..

CLOUGH rushes out of the doors, straightening his cuffs,

straightening his hair, buttoning his jacket. First out to

greet the arriving team.

He turns the corner to see the LEEDS COACH a hundred yards

down the street, the PLAYERS getting off the coach and

walking towards him..

TAYLOR mutters under his breath, "Soppy twat".

CLOUGH cranes his neck. Watches DON REVIE, 40's. Thick-set.

Severe, forbidding, intimidating, in a huddle with his

coaching staff, Les Cocker and Syd Owen. His henchmen. His

assassins. His "Goodfellas". His right and left hand.

CLOUGH walks towards him. Hand outstretched..

But REVIE walks past without shaking hands, without talking,

without even breaking stride..

..and disappears into the stadium, deep in conversation with

Les Cocker and Syd Owen.

CLOUGH stares. Hand still outstretched. He looks over at

PETER TAYLOR, who can't help smiling, `Forget it'.

TAYLOR and JIMMY GORDON walk off, but CLOUGH still stares at

REVIE in disbelief.

The LEEDS PLAYERS run out onto the pitch: HUNTER, MADELY,

BREMNER, GILES, REANEY, JONES, in a line, waving to the

crowd, turning North, South, East, West...

TAYLOR rubs his hands in excitement, "Here we go". But CLOUGH

is miles away. Still cannot let the insult go. He stares over

at the visiting team dug-out..

REVIE and his lieutenants. Whispering among themselves.

Huddled in thought. Huddled in strategy. Huddled in

malevolence.

Presently, the game starts. A roar from the crowd.

"Beeeep", the REF's whistle blows. A Derby PLAYER rolls in

agony, cries out, a terrible, cynical challenge. Horrified,

JIMMY GORDON and PETER TAYLOR up on thier feet in protest..

CLOUGH looks over to REVIE's bench. Sees REVIE and SYD OWEN

quietly applauding the Leeds PLAYER. Encouraging more of the

same. As the Derby PLAYER is stretchered off..

Presently, RRROOOOAAAARRRRR goes up. Goal Leeds. REVIE and

his henchmen get to their feet. Applauding. 1-0.

TAYLOR and JIMMY GORDON immediately start shouting out

encouragement to the Derby PLAYERS, new instructions, as the

game restarts..

CLOUGH doesn't join in. He continues to stare at REVIE in his

dugout.

Suddenly:

"Beeep!", whistle! Penatly Leeds! CLOUGH leaps off the bench

in outrage. Screaming, on his feel, protesting in disbelief..

REVIE shaking hands with his COLLEAGUES. Smiling amongst

themselves. Congratulating themselves. Celebrating.

The inevitable roar as Leeds convert, followed by,

"Beeeeeep", the sound of the final WHISTLE. CLOUGH stares in

disbelief. Robbed. Deflated.

The REFEREE blows the whistle for the end of the game.

CLOUGH watches as REVIE and SYD OWEN brush past, shaking

PETER TAYLOR and JIMMY GORDON's hands, (assuming TAYLOR's the

manager), on their way to the dressing-rooms, their minds

already on their next game...

CLOUGH stares as they go..

The two empty glasses waiting on the table.

CAPTION: "DERBY 0 - LEEDS 2"

Through the front door we see: DON REVIE, SYD OWEN and LES

COCKER walking to their bus, chuckling to themselves, deep in

discussion, already thinking about the next match.

But CLOUGH doesn't hear...

CLOUGH turns to TAYLOR...

TAYLOR opens his mouth, is about to protest..

CLOUGH's face: watching the Leeds PLAYERS board the bus...

CLOUGH's face: staring out at the Leeds PLAYERS waiting on

the training pitch. A deep breath.

CLOUGH removes his jacket. JIMMY GORDON and CLOUGH's SONS

watch as he walks out onto the training pitch...

CLOUGH walks out into the drizzle and towards the LEEDS

PLAYERS..

The players truculently gather round. CLOUGH watches them,

notes their mood, then..

Silence from the PLAYERS..

CLOUGH turns to PETER LORIMER.

CLOUGH turns to JOHNNY GILES..

CLOUGH turns to NORMAN HUNTER...

PLAYERS stare at one another. Bristling. Disbelieving looks.

CLOUGH sees that one side is a man short..

CLOUGH skillfully traps the ball between his feet, flips it

up onto this head - down onto his chest, then "WHAM" volleys

it into a distant goal..

CLOUGH removes his track suit trousers, rolls his neck. JIMMY

GORDON quickly divides the players into two teams, blows the

whistle..

The game starts. CLOUGH, leading by example, anxious to prove

himself, is soon darting about, calling out...

CLARKE passes the ball. But it's a fifty-fifty. Another

player bears down on CLOUGH..who refuses to pull out..

"CRUNCH", a bone-shaking tackle from "BITES YER LEGS".

CLOUGH is flattened. Rolls around on the floor. JIMMY GORDON

runs up to NORMAN HUNTER..

HUNTER aggressively steps forward. Nose to nose. He is

immediately flanked by other aggressive Leeds PLAYERS.

Crowding the referee. Intimidating him.

JIMMY GORDON backs off, visibly frightened. CLOUGH lies on

the floor. In agony. Holding his knee.

CLOUGH listens to the PLAYERS laughing at him. Disrespecting

him. His face darkens.

The sound of coarse, cruel laughter among the LEEDS PLAYERS.

JIMMY GORDON appears, CLOUGH's two SONS in tow..

JIMMY holds up a large parcel wrapped in brown paper.

CLOUGH's expression changes.

CLOUGH limps down a corridor. In a thunderous mood. Holding

the parcel. PEOPLE scatter.

The door flies open. CLOUGH storms into his office. He walks

over to the desk. DON REVIE's desk.

He unwraps the parcel, and takes out an axe.

CLOUGH's SONS watch as their father violently swings the axe

down onto the desk. The sickening sound of splintering wood.

CLOUGH watches the desk burn in a small bonfire outside.

MANNY CUSSINS and several DIRECTORS walk out.

They are surprised to see CLOUGH by the fire holding an

axe...

CLOUGH smiles politely, then turns, and walks to his car. The

DIRECTORS watch..

"Rrrriiinnnggg", the phone rings. CLOUGH and his FAMILY are

having Sunday lunch. BARBARA CLOUGH looks up..

"Rrrrriinnngggg". The phone rings. CLOUGH tries to ignore it.

"Rrrriiinnngggg", CLOUGH tries to eat, then..

CLOUGH gets up. Walks out of the room..

PETER TAYLOR, similarly in disgrace with his family,

similarly unable to go a single Sunday lunch without calling

CLOUGH, whispers down the phone, terrified of his wife..

A voice calls from TAYLOR's dining-room..

CLOUGH's face.

BARBARA CLOUGH rolls her eyes, puts down her cutlery, and

calls out..

No answer. BARBARA tuts to herself. Gets up from the table.

She walks out of the dining-room, calling out..

..and into the hall. BARBARA stops. She looks left and right.

No sign.

CLOUGH and TAYLOR emerge from a roadside cafe and walk

towards their car. They've missed Sunday lunch. So it's

Crisps. Sweets. Fizzy drinks. Almost childlike. Happier in

one another's company than with their own families.

They climb into the waiting car...

CLOUGH starts the engine...

CLOUGH and TAYLOR both giggle. Like kids. The car pulls

off...

CLOUGH's car pulls up outside a house in a quiet terraced

road in North London. TAYLOR checks it against the address on

a piece of paper. The two men get out of the car...

CLOUGH and TAYLOR walk up the garden path..

CLOUGH stops, rings the doorbell. Looks at TAYLOR.

`Snap', the door opens to reveal DAVE MACKAY, a thick set,

dark-haired bull of a man, with a thick Scots accent. CLOUGH

smiles ear to ear..

CLOUGH, TAYLOR and JIMMY GORDON training with the Derby

PLAYERS. SAM LONGSON, (late 60's), Chairman of Derby County

approaches, visibly angry..

LONGSON turns and double-takes....

CLOUGH smiles..

`Flash', DAVE MACKAY, JOHN MCGOVERN and JOHN O'HARE wearing

Derby strip, poses under the Derby County sign for

photographs with CLOUGH and TAYLOR..

CLOUGH and TAYLOR watch from the touchline as their new team

led by MACKAY plays in a match. CLOUGH watches in

admiration...

On the training ground: DAVE MACKAY, barrel-chested and

older, voice like a bullhorn, is already bossing about the

young players, urging them to "think"..

CLOUGH watches MACKAY passing the ball, creating space..

CLOUGH grabs TAYLOR's head, kisses him. OVER THIS: we fade in

the roar from the crowd...

CAPTION: `CARLISLE'

GOAL!! Derby score. CLOUGH and TAYLOR leap to their feet.

CAPTION: `BURY'

GOAL!! Derby score. CLOUGH and TAYLOR leap to their feet.

CAPTION: `HUDDERSFIELD'

GOAL!! Derby score. CLOUGH and TAYLOR leap to their feet.

Of DERBY winning the championship. Of NEWS STATIONS

announcing it in the Midlands.

A large, swanky house, as befits the multi-millionaire owner

of a successful haulage business.

SAM LONGSON, BRIAN CLOUGH, PETER TAYLOR and DAVE MACKAY are

all celebrating with all their families.

The trophy is centre-stage. CLOUGH sings a Sinatra classic..

To everyone's amusement: CLOUGH sings to PETER TAYLOR, not

his own wife..

In another corner: MACKAY is amiably ribbing LONGSON..

LONGSON starts eating his trademark felt hat. Much cheering

as he munches in disgust and swallows with difficulty.

Suddenly, DAVE MACKAY looks up, sees the television. Calls

for quiet!!

ON TV: a live awards presentation. From London. DON REVIE is

being presented with an award...

CLOUGH watches. His expression changes. His eyes burn into

REVIE's.

Loud CHEERS from LONGSON, TAYLOR, MACKAY and CLOUGH. OVER

THIS: we fade in the sound of roaring...

ARCHIVE TV FOOTAGE: Wembley Stadium on Charity Shield day.

The opening of the 1974/5 season.

DON REVIE is being interviewed by a TV JOURNALIST in

sheepskin coat and headphones..

A mischievous smile barely perceptible of REVIE's face..

CLOUGH with the LEEDS TEAM in the dressing-room before kick

off. PLAYERS changing. The stink of Ralgex. PHYSIOS bandaging

the injured. JIMMY GORDON massaging one or two players.

CLOUGH folds a piece of paper. A flicker of vulnerability.

Team talk over: the PLAYERS put on their shoes. Make final

preparations.

It's just REVIE and CLOUGH.

ARCHIVE FOOTAGE: the National Anthem finishes. A great ROAR

goes up.

The game is underway. The T.V. match COMMENTATORS can hardly

believe what they are seeing, (we catch snippets of

FLICKERING ARCHIVE FOOTAGE on their monitors)...

On the pitch: BREMNER and KEEGAN have started fighting..

CLOUGH watches from the dug-out. Unable to believe his eyes..

BILLY BREMNER walks off, angrily removing his shirt..

ARCHIVE FOOTAGE: Liverpool lift the CUP aloft. Delirious

cheering from their FANS...

The Leeds coach had pulled up and the players are all having

a piss-break. Among them CLOUGH..

Our CAMERA widens to reveal BILLY BREMNER pissing in line

with NORMAN HUNTER and JOHNNY GILES..

Silence. CLOUGH shakes himself dry.

BREMNER, GILES AND HUNTER turn. Walks back towards the bus.

DON REVIE's face: he watches through a window in Elland Road,

as....

The Derby Coach arrives. Hydraulic brakes HISSSSSSS. Doors

open. Boots, shoes, walk down steps.

BRIAN CLOUGH, PETER TAYLOR and the Derby Army disembark.

CLOUGH's face: as he looks up at the writing on the side of

the stadium. LEEDS UNITED F.C.

Some PLAYERS getting dressed. CLOUGH, TAYLOR and JIMMY GORDON

massaging others. Shin-pads. Water-bottles.

The PLAYERS clatter out, studs rattling down the tunnel, into

the roar of the CROWD..

CAPTION: LEEDS 5 - DERBY 0

CLOUGH and TAYLOR in a deserted bar. Alone. A television

plays in the corner. DON REVIE's face on TV...

CLOUGH thinks for a moment, then...

CLOUGH is working a session with the Derby PLAYERS. A car

screeches into the car park behind. A red-faced, apoplectic

SAM LONGSON gets out..

Two PLAYERS turn and wave to LONGSON..

SAM LONGSON lights a cigar, and walks off.

The Leeds coach pulls into the Derby car park. Doors open.

DON REVIE and SYD OWEN disembark.

Followed by the Leeds PLAYERS. Smoking. Side-burns. Long-

haired assassins one and all.

CLOUGH and TAYLOR watch from an upstairs corridor window..

CLOUGH and TAYLOR look at one another, "Nutter".

An atmosphere of expectation and excitement.

Outside, the sound of the crowd. The sound of tannoy

announcements. CLOUGH goes to JOHN MCGOVERN..

CLOUGH moves to JOHN O'HARE.

CLOUGH moves to another PLAYER. (his new signing, COLIN TODD)

Laughter in the dressing-room.

CLOUGH holds the door open, shaking each and every one of the

PLAYERS' hands as they clatter out into the tunnel..

CLOUGH sits in his dug-out. While JIMMY GORDON and TAYLOR are

calling out instructions to the Derby players on the pitch...

CLOUGH stares at REVIE and his lieutenants in their

neighbouring dug-out.

Presently...CLOUGH's view, and our frame is filled by two

wheel-chairs carrying disabled/learning difficulties FANS

wearing rosettes...

The wheel-chair FAN looks at CLOUGH for a beat, then

violently shakes a rattle...

CLOUGH's face: shocked. Then, all of a sudden....

"RRRRROOOOOOOAAAAAARRRRRR", a roar goes up. Goal Leeds. REVIE

and his henchmen leap to their feet, delighted. Applauding.

The WHEEL-CHAIR FAN screams with delight. Makes a `wanker'

gesture in CLOUGH's face.

CLOUGH's face: darkening like thunder.

CAPTION: "HALF-TIME: DERBY 0, LEEDS 1"

The DERBY PLAYERS sit in the dressing-room. Shaking.

Terrified. Trying to hide, find shelter, find protection.

Already fearing the rocket they will get, the lash of his

tongue..

Presently, the door opens, and CLOUGH walks in, carrying a

bottle of brandy, Remy Martin.

CLOUGH pours brandy into a tea-cup, gives it to a PLAYER..

CLOUGH turns to another PLAYER, (JOHN O'HARE), pours him a

shot of cognac...

CLOUGH turns to a third PLAYER, (COLIN TODD), hands him a

cup..

CLOUGH turns, and faces the room.

The PLAYERS stare at one another, holding their drinks.

The PLAYERS nervously down their drinks. CLOUGH exits..

CLOUGH walks out to see PETER TAYLOR and JIMMY GORDON waiting

- who were listening through the door..

CLOUGH winks...

CLOUGH storms off. PETER TAYLOR is left alone. Looks pale.

Momentarily holds his chest...

TAYLOR indicates JIMMY's cigarettes.

The Derby PLAYERS run out, belching, watched and encouraged

by PETER TAYLOR...

JIMMY GORDON emerges from the dressing-room, holding the

empty bottle of Scotch...

CLOUGH pacing in his office. Unable to watch. Like an

expectant father.

Presently the building reverberates with a large...

RRRROOOAAAARRRRRRRRR.

A goal. But scored by whom? Derby or Leeds?

CLOUGH looks up at the clock. The clock on the wall shows

it's 4.20.

Visibly anxious, CLOUGH starts pacing again. Presently,

another deafening...

RRRRROOOOOAAAAARRRRRRR

The building is almost brought to it's foundations..

CLOUGH looks up. Desperate to know. Derby or Leeds?

But it's only 4.35. Game still not over. Not by a long way.

CLOUGH carries on pacing. Walks from one side of the room to

the next. Left to right. Right to left.

Then, another stadium-shaking..

RRRRRROOOOOOAAAAAARRRRRR

CLOUGH looks up at the clock. 4.55.

This is intolerable. The game must be over now.

CLOUGH cannot bear it a moment longer. He opens the door.

CLOUGH walks down a corridor. Then runs. Then checks himself.

Slows down. Dignity. Dignity. But still walks as fast as he

can.

CLOUGH turns a corner to the dressing-rooms and the tunnel,

then sees PETER TAYLOR up ahead entering the tunnel from the

pitch with several Derby PLAYERS..

CLOUGH stops. TAYLOR looks up. Sees CLOUGH. Their eyes meet.

CLOUGH's eyes. TAYLOR's eyes.

Words are not necessary. TAYLOR's smile says it all. CLOUGH

runs towards TAYLOR. The two men embrace.

CLOUGH and TAYLOR walk off down the corridor.

JOURNALISTS laugh...

DON REVIE speaking to JOURNALISTS outside his home..

CLOUGH appearing on half-a-dozen TV shows. Quick,

controversial, charismatic, witty. A natural media star, (we

intercut our actor with the genuine archive footage)

The audience laughs.

JOHN SADLER, pipe smoking football journalist, sits in a

television studio, (CALENDER)..

All laugh.

DAVID COLEMAN, black and white footage, speaking into a

bakolite telephone..

CLOUGH sits at home, his SON on his lap.

MICHAEL PARKINSON, the highest rating talk show on TV..

Laughter.

BLACK AND WHITE ARCHIVE TV FOOTAGE OF MOHAMMED ALI

CLOUGH and TAYLOR, surrounded by FRIENDS and FAMILIES, with

flowers, telegrams, bottles of champagne, boxes of cigars.

Watching the Mohammed Ali on television.

They roar with laughter. Cheers and celebration. Everyone

roughing up CLOUGH's hair, patting him on the back.

The QUEEN's face. Full-frame. Beside her PRINCE PHILIP.

A portrait of Her Majesty the Queen and HRH the Duke of Kent

hangs on an oak-pannelled wall: the Patron and the President

of the Football Association..

Beneath the portrait: a long table in a boardroom. An austere

six-man disciplinary committee of the FA. Blazers and

buttons. Whiskers and power.

Aldermen, Freemasons, Generals, white-hair and golden

buttons. Admirals, Presidents and Vice-Presidents.

Sitting in front of the committee...

BILLY BREMNER and BRIAN CLOUGH. Like schoolchildren..

CLOUGH's face: a victorious look.

"Bang", he brings down a gavel. CLOUGH's face: the smile

fades..

The COMMITTEE MEMBERS get to their feet and walk out.

CLOUGH's face: OVER THIS: the sound of a ringing phone. The

sound of a familiar voice at the other end..

CLOUGH in his cheap hotel-room. PETER TAYLOR's voice the

other end..

TAYLOR freezes, hearing the voice, (we intercut as necessary

for the remainder of the call)..

The same sign as earlier.

"MR. D. MACKAY - MANAGER".

CLOUGH stares at the sign as he parks his car in the space

beside it. A stab in his heart.

CLOUGH walks along a corridor. Sees the PLAYERS training

outside. HIS players. DERBY players.

To one side, MCGOVERN and O'HARE. CLOUGH looks out at them.

He winks, discreetly at them. They look back, and nod.

Then get back to work.

The sound of laughter. The camaraderie of a family. What a

contrast to Leeds.

CLOUGH walks along a corridor with photos on the wall. Framed

photos of HIS victories.

HIS club. HIS family. HIS home.

CLOUGH walks into the office to see DAVE MACKAY behind his

desk. Who gets to his feet. Extends his hand.

CLOUGH is about to explode, then..

The two MEN shake hands. Barely.

CLOUGH walks to the door. He turns, and indicates the desk.

CLOUGH driving his car. Clenching the steering wheel in fury.

It's late: JIMMY GORDON with CLOUGH in the bar..

OVER THIS: the sound of a ringing phone...

DUNCAN MACKENZIE, long-haired, chain-smoking, bemused, stands

in the lobby of the hotel. OVER THIS: we hear...

`Pop', a WAITER uncorks champagne, pours it into glasses.

CLOUGH and his three sheepish new signings: MCGOVERN, O'HARE

and DUNCAN MACKENZIE sit uneasily in the bar.

MACKENZIE lights a cigarette..

MCGOVERN and O'HARE privately exchange looks, "Here goes".

O'HARE mouths "Two hundred and seventy-four"..

MCGOVERN closes his eyes, "Moron."

CLOUGH shoots a look to the others..

CLOUGH indicates MACKENZIE's drink..

MACKENZIE knocks back his champagne..

CLOUGH sighs and goes. MCGOVERN and O'HARE roll their eyes.

MACKENZIE stubs his cigarette, and hurries after them..

"Flash", photographs are being taken by PRESS of the three

new signings, DUNCAN MCKENZIE, JOHN O'HARE and JOHN MCGOVERN,

all wearing Leeds shirts.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL: they are being watched from a distance

by several Leeds SENIOR players..

CLOUGH walks through a corridor, brushing past JOHNNY GILES,

BILLY BREMNER and several other SENIOR PLAYERS. An

intimidating atmosphere..

GILES, BREMNER et al walk off. CLOUGH left, staring.

OVER THIS: a large RRRRROOOAAARRRR. GOAL.

The LEEDS PLAYERS trudge in, after the game. Angry. Heads

hung low. Begin to strip off.

CAPTION: "QPR 1, Leeds 0."

CLOUGH enters. Visibly gutted by the result, but now's not

the time to show it..

CLOUGH walks round the dressing-room, shaking hands

individually, patting PLAYERS on the back...

CLOUGH's tone is sensitive. Tactful. Considerate.

But several of the LEEDS PLAYERS refuse his hand. Or freeze

at his touch. Turn away from him..

The LEEDS PLAYERS stare at one another. Shoot one another

looks.
