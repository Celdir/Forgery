SISTER MARGUERITE is locking up for the night, shutting doors,

turning off lights, finally walks off down the corridor. Suddenly a

terrified scream is heard, the voice of a young woman.

EXT - CONVENT - NIGHT

Lights in the windows flick on.

INT - TOP CORRIDOR - NIGHT

The nuns    are running up the corridor in their night dresses and caps,

calling    urgently in French. They reach the door of Sister Agnes' room

and try    the door. It is blocked. Pushing harder they see the blood

stained    figure of SISTER AGNES. Much alarm and crying...

EXT - CONVENT - NIGHT

An ambulance comes tearing down the road, siren blaring. It cuts the

siren and stops outside the convent gates. The nuns open the gate and

the ambulance drives inside.

INT - TOP CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Two PARAMEDICS urgently run the stretcher down the hall to the

unconscious figure of Sister Agnes. The Mother Superior desperately

wipes and kisses her face.

They lift her on to the stretcher and run back down the hall.

The Mother Superior looks around worriedly and goes into...

EXT - SUPREME COURT - DAY

A normal busy day. A car pulls up with a woman and a man driving. The

woman is MARTHA LIVINGSTON. She kisses the man (LARRY), gets out of

the car, runs across the road dodgingtraffic and goes up the steps of

the courthouse. There a group of REPORTERS there and a sudden bustle

of interest.

Martha watches intently as 3 nuns, the Mother Superior, Sister

Marguerite, and Sister Agnes (dressed in a white novices habit) and

their LAWYER come out of the court escorted by police. The reporters

leap on them, taking photographs, asking questions in English and

French. Suddenly Sister Agnes looks right at Martha, then she is

quickly bustled past. Martha goes on into the courthouse.

How? How? She hallucinates, stops

that supposed to convince me she

shouldn't be touched. Give me a miracle.

Who is he?

Why must he be anybody?

My God, you're as crazy as...

Stop laughing, I don't say it's the truth,

I'm saying...

How (distorted) ?

Don't be ridiculous.

Well give me a reasonable explanation

A miracle is an event without an

explanation. If she's capable of putting

a hole in her hand without benefit of a

nail, why couldn't she split a cell in her

womb?

This is insane.

night and no way for any man to get in

or out.

You're saying God did it?

No, that's as much as saying Father

Martineau did it. I'm saying God

permitted it.

But how did it happen?

You'll never find the answer for

everything God did.

I thought you didn't believe in miracles

I want the choice to believe.

is a lie    because you won't face the fact

But she is not an enigma Mother.

Everything that Agnes has done is

explainable from modern psychiatry.

One, two, three, right down the line.

That's what you believe she is?     The

sum of her psychological parts?

That's what I have to believe...

Then why are you so obsessed with her?

You're thinking about her all the time.
