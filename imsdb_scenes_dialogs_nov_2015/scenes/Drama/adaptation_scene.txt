Charlie Kaufman and Donald Kaufman

EXT. ROCKY TERRAIN - DAY

Endless barren landscape. No sign of life. The atmosphere

is hazy, toxic-looking. Volcanoes erupt. Meteors bombard.

Lightning strikes, concussing murky pools of water. Silence.

INT. LARGE EMPTY LIVING ROOM - MORNING

SUBTITLE: HOLLYWOOD, CA, FOUR BILLION AND FORTY YEARS LATER

Beamed ceilings and ostentatious fireplace. A few birthday

cards on the mantel, two of them identical: "To Our Dear Son

on His Fortieth Birthday." Charlie Kaufman, a fat, balding

man in a purple sweater with tags still attached, paces the

room. His incantational voice-over carpets the scene.

EXT. STATE ROAD 29 - DAWN

A lonely two-lane highway cutting through swampland.

Suddenly, a beat-up white van barrels around a curve.   It's

followed closely by an old green Ford.

SUBTITLE: STATE ROAD 29, FLORIDA, FIVE YEARS EARLIER

INT. WHITE VAN - CONTINUOUS

John Laroche drives. He's a skinny man with no front teeth.

The van is piled with bags of potting soil, gardening junk.

A Writings of Charles Darwin audio cassette case is on the

seat next to Laroche.

CONTINUED:

Laroche tries to contemplate the plants and birds whizzing

by. Almost too late, he spots the Fakahatchee Strand State

Preserve sign and makes a squealing right onto the dirt road

turn-off. The cassette case flies from the seat and half-

buries itself in an open bag of peat.

INT. GREEN FORD - CONTINUOUS

Nirvana blasts. Russell, Vinson, and Randy, three young

Indian men, pass a joint and watch the erratic van ahead.

They share a stoned laugh.

EXT. NEW YORK APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

SUBTITLE: NEW YORK, TWO YEARS LATER

Late night street. The click-click of typing. We move

slowly up the building to the only glowing window.

In the window, lit by a single desk lamp, a woman types.

INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

We glide over the desk piled with books about orchids, past a

photo of Laroche tacked to an overwhelmed bulletin board, and

come to rest on a woman typing. It's Susan Orlean: pale,

delicate and blond. We lose ourselves in her melancholy

beauty. She turns to the camera and talks to us.

CONTINUED:

INT. RANGER'S TRUCK - MID-MORNING

Tony, a ranger, drives along a dirt road past the Fakahatchee

Strand State Preserve sign and enters the swamp. He sees the

white van and Ford parked ahead, spots a Seminole license

plate on the Ford. He pulls over down the road, and whispers

into his C.B.

Tony waits for a response.   Nothing.

Nothing still.   Tony clears his throat into the radio.

No response. Tony glowers, gets out of the truck, watches

the vehicles through binoculars. Nothing. He straightens

his cap. Mosquitoes land on his neck, his nose, his lips.

INT. L.A. BUSINESS LUNCH RESTAURANT - MIDDAY

Kaufman, wearing his purple sweater sans tags, sits with

Valerie, an attractive woman in wire-rim glasses. They pick

at salads. Kaufman steals glances at her lips, her hair, her

breasts. She looks up at him. He blanches, looks away.

CONTINUED:

Valerie absently rubs her nose.      Kaufman self-consciously

rubs his nose in response.

Valerie rubs her nose again. Kaufman pulls at his nostril.

A rivulet of sweat slides down his forehead. Valerie watches

it. Kaufman sees her watching it. She sees him seeing her

watching it. She looks at her salad. He quickly swabs.

Kaufman's brow is dripping again.      He smiles, embarrassed.

In one motion, Kaufman swabs his forehead and pulls a book

entitled The Orchid Thief from his bag.

CONTINUED: (2)

Kaufman nods, flips through the book, stalling. There's a

smiling author photo of Susan Orlean on the inside back

cover.

Kaufman is sweating like crazy now.       Valerie is quiet for a

moment.

CONTINUED: (3)

INT. OFFICE - DAY

SUBTITLE: HOLLYWOOD, CALIFORNIA, THREE WEEKS EARLIER

The office is decorated with potted flowers, Audobon posters,

lots of books. Kaufman, nervous and sweaty, watches

Margaret, a soulful development executive, unpack boxes.

Kaufman is thrilled; he's scored. Margaret pulls a copy of

The Orchid Thief from her bookshelf.

CONTINUED:

Margaret plops onto the couch next to Kaufman.

Margaret giggles happily.    Kaufman giggles weirdly.

EXT. SWAMP - MORNING

Hot, dirty, miserable. Laroche leads the Indians through

waist-high black water. He points out a turtle on a rock.

CONTINUED:

The Indians ignore him. They trudge. Laroche spots

something else, a dull green root wrapped around a tree. He

stops, circles the tree. His eyes widen in reverent awe.

The Indians come around. Laroche stares at a single

beautiful, glowing white flower hanging from the tree.   He

tenderly caresses the petals. Then, business-like:

Russell pulls out a hacksaw, begins sawing through the tree.

INT. RESTAURANT - MIDDAY

Kaufman still sweats as he talks to Valerie.

CONTINUED:

INT. PET STORE (1972) - DAY

SUBTITLE: NORTH MIAMI, TWENTY-SIX YEARS EARLIER

A serious ten year old boy walks from cage to aquarium,

studying the inhabitants. He turns to his frumpy mother,

who's been following at a respectful distance.

She nods sweetly. The boy returns to his search.        He stops

at a small turtle in an aquarium.

EXT. SWAMP - MORNING

As Laroche supervises, Randy, Russell, and Vinson saw through

tree branches supporting lovely flowering orchids. They

unceremoniously stuff the flowers into bulging pillowcases.

INT. ROMANTIC RESTAURANT - EVENING

Kaufman eats with Margaret.     Margaret raises a glass.

Kaufman, pleased, clicks glasses.     He takes a breath.

CONTINUED:

The entrees arrive.

Kaufman begins the laborious task of getting through his

plate of food. He can no longer look up at Margaret.

CONTINUED: (2)

INT. BARNES AND NOBLE - DAY

Kaufman pulls a bunch of orchid books off the shelf, carries

them to the register, along with a book on Hegel, which

features an engraving of the philosopher on the cover.

Kaufman waits in line and watches the tattooed female cashier

flirting with the handsome guy ahead of him. He studies

their interaction, the way she looks at him. Her eyes, her

lips. The guy leaves and the cashier waves Kaufman over. As

she rings him up, she expresses no interest in him. He's

hurt and fixates on a sexy flower tattoo on her arm. She

catches him, pulls down her sleeve.

EXT. JANES SCENIC DRIVE - MORNING

Tony waits, sweaty and mosquito bitten.   The radio crackles.

Rustling near the parked cars. Tony tenses. Laroche steps

from the swamp with the Indians, who haul the pillowcases.

Tony jumps into the truck and turns it around.

INT. ORLEAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Orlean types. Her delicate fingers move with a pianist's

grace across the computer keyboard.

EXT. TROPICAL RIVER - DAY

SUBTITLE: ORINOCO RIVER, ONE HUNDRED YEARS EARLIER

An overturned boat and uprooted orchids float on the river.

SUBTITLE: RIO HACHA

A man lies face down near an unplucked orchid.

EXT. RIVER - DAY

SUBTITLE: YANGTZE RIVER

An emaciated, limping, wheezing man with a makeshift bandage

wrapped around his head, docks his boat.

Someone steps from behind a bush, stabs him, steals his boat.

The murderer sails down river.

EXT. JANES SCENIC DRIVE - MORNING

Tony steps out of his truck.   Laroche smiles warmly.

CONTINUED:

Laroche goes back to directing the Indians.    Tony's confused.

Tony nods, even though he has no idea.

Laroche looks to the Indians for confirmation.       They give it.

CONTINUED: (2)

Laroche again looks to the Indians for confirmation.

Tony looks at the Indians.

INT. RENTAL CAR - DAY

We watch Orlean as she drives out of the Miami Airport

parking lot, onto the freeway, past congestion and

billboards. Her mournful face glows beautifully,

dramatically with golden sunlight. She talks to us.

Orlean gets quiet.   Her eyes tear.

EXT. SUBURBAN BACKYARD - DAY

SUBTITLE: AKRON, OHIO, THIRTY YEARS EARLIER

CONTINUED:

Lush color. A seven year old girl is gleeful as her parents

push her on a swing. She watches from the air as her mother

and father, deeply in love, kiss between pushes.

EXT. BIG SPANISH-STYLE HOUSE - DAY

Kaufman gets out of his car with his books. Two teenage

girls walk by. Kaufman watches as one whispers to the other.

He thinks he hears the word "Fatso." The girls giggle.

INT. EMPTY HOUSE - A COUPLE OF MINUTES LATER

Kaufman passes a hall mirror, regards himself glumly, and

climbs the stairs.

At the landing Kaufman comes upon Donald, his identical twin

brother, on his back in pajama bottoms, opening a gift box.

Kaufman nods vaguely, continues down the hall. Donald pulls

a purple sweater from the box, calls after Kaufman.

Kaufman doesn't respond, enters his bedroom.

INT. EMPTY BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Kaufman lies face down on his mattress on the floor.

Kaufman pulls a copy of Variety, open to a photo of Margaret,

from under his pillow. He gets lost in the picture.

Donald, now in the sweater, appears on all fours in the

doorway. Kaufman puts the paper back under his pillow.

CONTINUED:

Donald stares at the ceiling, fuming. Kaufman waits.

Getting no no response, he pulls out his Hegel book and

reads:

Kaufman's head is spinning. He puts the book down. Both

brothers stare at the ceiling. Donald finally speaks

INT. KITCHEN (1972) - EVENING

The young boy eats with his family. His father wears a

backbrace, his sister is weak and anemic. Only his sweet

mother pays attention as he chatters excitedly.

CONTINUED:

EXT. SWAMP - LATE MORNING

Ranger, sheriff, and state police cars are parked near the

van and Ford. Lots of sweating, uniformed people. The

pillowcases have been emptied, the plants lie on black

plastic sheets. A guy sprinkles water on them. Laroche

enthusiastically helps Ranger Mike Owen catalogue the

flowers. The Indians lean against their car, bored and

smoking. Nirvana seeps tinnily out the car window.

CONTINUED:

INT. EMPTY DINING ROOM - DAY

Kaufman sits at a card table, picking at a salad and reading

an orchid book. Donald lies on the floor, chomping a hoagie

and reading a copy of Story by Robert McKee.

Kaufman, bored, looks over at Donald, whose cheeks are

stuffed with food.

CONTINUED:

The two glare at each other.   They go back to their books.

INT. RENTAL CAR - DAY

Orlean drives on State Road 29, past prefab housing, into

swampland. She talks to us.

She brushes a wisp of hair from her face and tucks it behind

her small, pretty ear. We linger on the ear, which grows

pink with sunlight. Orlean catches us and smiles shyly.

INT. EMPTY BEDROOM - DAY

Kaufman traces a stubby, nail-bitten finger along State Road

29 along a Florida road map. He turns to his typewriter, and

types in a clumsy hunt-and-peck style.

INT. COURT ROOM - DAY

The proceedings are in progress.   Orlean hurries in, sits in

the back.

CONTINUED:

Laroche, in a Miami Hurricanes cap, wrap-around Mylar

sunglasses, and a Hawaiian shirt, is on the stand. Alan

Lerner, the tribe's lawyer, questions him.

INT. BARNES AND NOBLE - DAY

As she rings up his books, Kaufman admires the cashier's

flower tattoo. She catches him and smiles with red, wet,

pierced lips. She unbuttons her blouse and shows him a breast

with a heart tattoo. A sweet heartbeat turns to knocking.

INT. EMPTY BEDROOM - NIGHT

Kaufman, in bed masturbating, looks up at the closed door.

The door opens.    Donald stands there for a moment in shadows.

CONTINUED:

Kaufman squints at his brother, sits up, waits.

Kaufman groans, lies down, pulls the covers over his face.

Donald waits, proud.    Kaufman pulls off the covers.

CONTINUED: (2)

Donald waits blankly.   Kaufman gives up, gets out of bed,

dresses.

Kaufman exits.

EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY

Orlean exits the courthouse and watches Laroche in a huddle

with Lerner, Vinson, and Buster Baxley, vice-president of the

tribe's business operations. They're all smoking intently.

Buster waves a dismissive hand at Lerner, walks away. Vinson

shrugs, stubs his cigarette, follows Buster. Lerner and

Laroche stand there a moment. Lerner walks off. Laroche

cracks his neck. A charmingly shy Orlean approaches.

Orlean smiles, apologetic for the intrusion.

CONTINUED:

Laroche scowls, smokes furiously, then, a test:

Orlean scribbles on her pad. Laroche twists his head to see

that she's writing "Judge can screw herself."

Orlean nods.   Laroche smiles his toothless smile at Orlean.

EXT. FIELD - MORNING

MUSIC: lush, profound orchestral piece.

A glorious orange, large-petalled orchid blooms in dramatic

time-lapse. We slowly, lovingly circle the flower.

INT. CALIFORNIA PIZZA KITCHEN - DAY

Kaufman, in a booth, reads his orchid book, takes notes.

He's bored, looks up, watches a waitress with glorious,

orange hair, pouty lips, soulful eyes, and a voluptuous form

turning slowly around, scanning her station.

CONTINUED:

She sees Kaufman, approaches, and smiles warmly down at him.

Her badge reads: Alice, Arcadia, CA. Kaufman sweats.

He goes blank.

He flinches at his response.    A small awkward pause.

She smiles warmly again and leaves.    Kaufman is humiliated.

EXT. ORCHID SHOW - DAY

Alice the waitress and Kaufman walk hand-in-hand, inspecting

sexy orchids together. She smiles warmly at him.

INT. EMPTY ROOM - NIGHT

Kaufman finishes jerking off.   He lies lonely in the dark.

INT. SUBURBAN BACKYARD - EVENING

Dark and muted. The seven year old girl is pushed on the

swing by her father. From the air she sees her mother, tiny

and lost, sitting across the yard smoking.

EXT. HOTEL PARKING LOT - MORNING

Orlean leans against a car and smokes. A tiny, lost figure.

There's a honk. Orlean snaps out of her reverie to see

Laroche screeching to a stop in his banged-up van.

CONTINUED:

She opens the passenger door.

Orlean nods, climbs in, and tries to rearrage some of the

junk on the front seat so she'll have a place to sit.

She situates herself on the seat.     Laroche lurches off.

INT. VAN - DAY

Laroche drives manically. Orlean watches the road and holds

one hand against the dashboard.

He looks at her and smiles. Orlean smiles back and

indicates, with a small jerk of the head, that he might want

to watch the road. He doesn't take the hint.

CONTINUED:

In handwriting made jerky by the bouncing van, Orlean writes

"shitload of change" on her notepad.

EXT. SWAMP - DAY

Old black and white footage, taken from up high, of two 19th

century men leading a horse drawn cart full of poached

orchids.

The camera swoops down, close to the men. As it does, the

image transforms. It turns to color, the men become

mannequins, the horse becomes papier-mache: it's a display.

A live man in modern work clothes is arranging actual orchids

in the cardboard cart.

INT. CAR - DAY

Kaufman drives slowly past Barnes and Noble, squints in the

window, sees the tattooed cashier. He passes Burger King,

sees a pretty employee, the same at Starbucks. Glassed-in

women on display, different types, different attitudes.

Kaufman stops in front of the California Pizza Kitchen.

Alice and her orange hair glow through the window. He

hesitates, then drives off.

INT. EMPTY BEDROOM - MORNING

Kaufman sits on the floor and types.

Donald enters. Kaufman ignores him, continues typing.

Donald dawdles, picks up The Orchid Thief, flips through it.

CONTINUED:

Kaufman stares at Donald, rubs his eyes, then:

INT. BOY'S BEDROOM (1972) - NIGHT

There are now many turtles in aquariums. Many turtle books

and posters. The boy, in a turtle T-shirt, looks out the

window into the darkness. His eyes are troubled.

INT. LIVING ROOM (1972) - CONTINUOUS

The boy comes downstairs. His father, in his backbrace,

watches TV; his sister lies on the couch, semi-conscious,

more pale than before. His mother pats the girl's head with

a damp cloth. There's a little Hindu altar with candles.

The boy surveys the sad scene.    His mother looks up, smiles.

The boy beams with pride, then gets solemn.

The boy and his mother look at each other.

The boy nods his head solemnly.

INT. VAN - DAY

Laroche drives, solemnly nodding his head. Orlean studies

him for a moment, her sad eyes wet and glistening.

CONTINUED:

They drive in silence.    Orlean watches a flying heron.

Laroche fishes through junk as he drives.

CONTINUED: (2)

INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY

Kaufman sits in silence across from his female therapist.

INT. CALIFORNIA PIZZA KITCHEN - DAY

Kaufman, hair combed, sits nervously in a booth, watching

Alice. He tenses as she comes up to him. She smiles warmly.

CONTINUED:

She winks at him.   He's so in love.

Awkward pause.

He beams.    She smiles and turns to leave.    Kaufman blurts:

CONTINUED: (2)

Alice turns back, still smiling.

Alice's smile slips away.    Her warmth dissipates.

He nods, watches Alice walk away and say something to another

waitress. The other waitress looks over at him. He sweats.

The other waitress brings his pie.      He smiles a thank you.

INT. NEW YORK APARTMENT - MORNING

Orlean sits at her desk and talks to us.

EXT. SANTA BARBARA ORCHID SHOW - DAY

Kaufman walks alone among the crowd of orchid enthusiasts,

past a Santa Barbara Orchid Society sign. He tries to study

the flowers. They are dull. He forces himself to look.

Kaufman finds his attention drifting from orchids to women:

all different shapes, colors, personalities, some in subtle

clothing, some in garish clothing, all glowing.

CONTINUED:

He is sick with adoration for the women, who pay him no mind.

One by one the women turn to the men they're with: a whisper

in the ear, a shared look, an arm slipped through an arm.

Kaufman is alone in this sea of people and flowers.

EXT. SWAMP - DAY

Teenaged Laroche and his mother tromp through the swamp. He

carries a camera on a tripod. They spot a beautiful flower.

Laroche is in awe.

Laroche sets up the tripod, focuses on the flower.    His

mother almost cries at the flower's beauty.

CONTINUED:

Laroche snaps the photo, makes a check in his notebook.

She smiles at him, rubs his neck.

INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY

Kaufman talks to the therapist.

Kaufman glances down at his therapist's breasts. He does it

fast and unintentionally. He quickly shifts back to her

face. His therapist wraps her shawl around her.

INT. SHOW HALL - DAY

Crowded with orchid lovers. Noisy chatter and calliope

music. Elaborate displays include orchids on a ferris wheel,

plastic clowns, and a booth that looks like a circus big top.

Laroche runs over to a flower.

CONTINUED:

INT. EMPTY BEDROOM - NIGHT

A depressed Kaufman fishes on his floor through an ever

increasing pile of books: books about turtles, mirror

resilvering, tropical fish, Hegel, etc. He picks up The

Portable Darwin. The cover features a daguerreotype of

Darwin. Kaufman paces and reads.

INT. BOOK-LINED STUDY - NIGHT

SUBTITLE: ENGLAND, ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE YEARS EARLIER

Sepia.   A sickly Darwin writes at his desk.

INT. EMPTY BEDROOM - NIGHT

Kaufman looks off into space, thinking. Silence. Suddenly,

he grabs his mini-recorder and paces like a caged animal.

EXT. SHOW HALL - DAY

Blasting music.   Crowds.   Laroche shows the flower to Orlean.

CONTINUED:

Laroche mimes humping.

Orlean looks around: people sniffing flowers, feeling petals,

staring deep into nectaries. People jabber passionately,

people buy plants, people carry boxes of purchased plants.

Orlean looks deeply into various flowers, at a dizzying array

of colors and shapes, but remains detached.

INT. APARTMENT - EARLY EVENING

Orlean stares at photos of orchids on her bulletin board.

She can't find a way in. She looks over at her husband

reading. He smiles at her. She smiles back, but there's a

terrible distance between them. She looks at us sadly.

Orlean stares out the window at the empty street below.   A

plastic bag dips and rises in the breeze. She inhales.

EXT. SUBURBAN BACKYARD - NIGHT

The seven year old girl swings sadly by herself. From high

up she sees her mother in a window at one end of the house,

her father in a window at the other end. Both stare blankly

in opposite directions. The swing completes it's arc and the

girl descends, losing sight of her parents.

INT. LARGE EMPTY LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Kaufman types furiously.   He's a sweaty mess.

He reads back what he's written.

The front door bursts open and Donald charges in.

INT. ORLEAN'S KITCHEN - EVENING

Orlean eats a silent dinner with her husband.

CONTINUED:

He nods.   She smiles, picks up her dish, puts it in the sink.

INT. ORLEAN'S STUDY - EVENING

Orlean looks at the photo of Laroche, sits sadly for a

moment, then types.

EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

SUBTITLE: NORTH MIAMI, TEN YEARS EARLIER

A younger Laroche, in a hard hat, walks atop a half-built

house. He spots a flower in a backyard across the street.

He loses his footing, falls two storeys, lands on his back.

INT. DINER - DAY

Laroche talks.    Orlean takes notes.

Laroche scarfs his pie.    Orlean watches him.

INT. SUBURBAN SUN ROOM - DAY

A prim woman reads a magazine article by Laroche entitled,

"Would You Die For Your Plants." There's a smiling photo of

a frail, emaciated Laroche next to his byline.

INT. DINER - DAY

Laroche talks, mouth full of pie.    Orlean takes notes.

EXT. NURSERY - DAY

Laroche and his wife, in wedding clothes, stand outside their

nursery The Bromeliad Tree posing for an auto-timed photo.

Laroche wears a cumbersome back brace. The camera flashes.

INT. EMPTY BEDROOM - NIGHT

Kaufman types tentatively. Off-screen we hear Donald's

enthusiastic typing and giggling.

Kaufman stops, scratches his head.    His hand is covered with

loose hairs. He whines.

INT. DINER - DAY

Laroche talks to Orlean.

CONTINUED:

INT. THE BROMELIAD TREE - DAY

Lots of lonely-looking customers admiring orchids. Laroche

is in the midst of them, happily chatting with whomever

approaches him. One guy pulls Laroche aside.

Customer #2 enters with a creepy, dark flowered orchid.

Other customers gather around.

Laroche picks up a ringing phone. Customer #3 continues to

try and get his attention while he talks.

INT. VAN - NIGHT

Laroche drives.    Orlean looks out at the dark night.

CONTINUED:

Orlean looks at him.     After a long silence, Laroche muses:

INT. AGENT'S OFFICE - DAY

Kaufman sits with his agent Jerry in a glass-walled office.

Jerry waves at a passing beauty. She waves back, keeps

walking. Kaufman follows the girl's ass with his eyes.

Kaufman looks at Jerry.     Will he accept help from an agent?

Kaufman pulls out a folded newspaper clipping, reads:

CONTINUED:

Jerry gets distracted by another sexy woman walking by.

MONTAGE

Jumble of images: Laroche talking, flowers, Indians, Orlean,

the trial. The rapid fire click-click of typing.

INT. EMPTY BEDROOM - NIGHT

Kaufman awakes with a start. Enthusiastic off-screen typing.

Kaufman peers through the darkness at the books, papers

coffee cups, and dirty plates all around.

EXT. SWAMP - DAY

Black and white. It's dark, tangled with foliage, and

foreboding. Two pioneers slog waist-high through the water.

Alligators regard them menacingly.

The scene turns into color. The men turn into mannequins.

The floor is covered with black cellophane representing swamp

water. The swamp turns to cardboard, with real orchids

hanging from the trees. A guy carrying some orchids walks on

top of the cellophane, past the mannequins.

INT. LAROCHE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The room is dark, lit only by the light of the TV Laroche's

father watches. Laroche and Orlean sit on the couch.

CONTINUED:

Laroche glances at his father, who just stares at the TV. On

the TV set are two framed photos: one of Laroche's sister and

one of Laroche's mother.

INT. LAROCHE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

SUBTITLE: NORTH MIAMI, NINE YEARS EARLIER

Laroche ushers his wife, mother, and uncle out of the house.

His father watches TV. There's only a photo of Laroche's

sister on the TV set now.

His father doesn't respond.

INT. LAROCHE'S CAR - A FEW MOMENTS LATER

They pile into a nice new American car, his wife in front,

his mother and uncle in back. Laroche pulls into traffic.

Laroche smiles back at his mother. A screech of tires and

another car crashes head on into theirs. Laroche's face

smacks against the steering wheel, his front teeth fly in all

directions. His mother rockets forward smashing through the

windshield. His uncle hits Laroche's wife in the head,

jerking her forward and landing on top of her.

EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

Banged-up and missing his front teeth, Laroche stands amidst

a group of mourners at a double funeral.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Kaufman stares at his typewriter.        There's a big pile of

papers next to him.

The phone rings.

CONTINUED:

INT. ORLEAN'S APARTMENT - EVENING

Orlean looks at a book called The Native Orchids of Florida.

She comes to a photo of the ghost orchid glowing white on the

page. Orlean's husband walks by with a cup of coffee,

caresses her shoulder. She tenses slightly, smiles up at him

apologetically. He smiles back sadly. She returns to the

photo. A line of text catches her eye: "Should one be lucky

enough to see a flower all else will seem eclipsed." Orlean

closes the book, sits there. She dials the phone.

INT. EMPTY BEDROOM - MORNING

A hollow-eyed Kaufman is zipping up a suitcase.

INT. EMPTY LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

She kisses him, looks lovingly at him.

INT. AIRPLANE BATHROOM - NIGHT

adjusts himself, and exits the bathroom.

INT. AIRPLANE - CONTINUOUS

Kaufman steps out of the bathroom. The stewardess is there

talking to another stewardess. She regards Kaufman blankly,

One of the stewardesses laughs. He tenses, takes his seat.

Orlean watches the hundreds of square miles of black, wet

Florida swampland pass by below.

old cars.

Ranger Mike Owen answers.

It's Kaufman standing there.

EXT. SWAMP - MORNING

The sky is overcast. Mike Owen leads Kaufman through a cool

swamp, which is completely dry. The two men walk easily on

peaty ground. Kaufman, slathered with sun screen and covered

head to foot in unnecessary protective clothing, tries to be

interested in Owen's lecture.

EXT. SWAMP - LATER

Mike Owen holds a handful of peat.   Kaufman looks at it.

CONTINUED:

Kaufman looks down and sees a plain-looking little lizard

Her name badge reads: Caryn, Tampa, FL. She smiles at

Kaufman as she looks right through him.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

A morose Kaufman sits on the bed reading The Orchid Thief.

Kaufman is deeply moved. He hi-lites the passage, then looks

at the smiling photo of Orlean. He finds himself lost in it.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Orlean, dirty from the swamp, is on the phone.

A few young Indian guys are hauling bags of potting soil.

cartoon Indian on his T-shirt.

INT. TRAILER - CONTINUOUS

Laroche enters his office, looks at some papers on his desk.

CONTINUED:

Before Orlean can respond, Laroche picks up the phone and

dials an impossibly long number. He waits, gestures for

Orlean to sit on a chair piled high with junk.

Buster appears in the door.

CONTINUED: (2)

Laroche stares at Buster.   Buster stares back.

INT. VAN - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Laroche weaves through traffic.   Orlean holds on.

MONTAGE

Gray skies. Kaufman drives his rental car: he looks at the

Seminole Nursery, the Collier County Courthouse, Laroche's

house. He drives through swampy terrain. He walks around at

an orchid show, he attends a slide-show orchid lecture. It's

all dull. He ends up sitting on a bench on an empty beach,

staring out at the ocean.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Orlean dials the phone.   It rings for a long time.    Finally:

CONTINUED:

Orlean rolls her eyes.

Orlean is silent, taps her fingers on the bedside table.

Laroche hangs up. Orlean sits there for a moment, flips

through her list of orchid collector names.

EXT. EMPTY BEACH - DAY

Kaufman sits on the bench, looking out at the ocean. An

attractive, spandexed couple skate by, chatting in German.

He watches the woman, hoping for a look, for something. He

doesn't get it. They're gone. A tan older man sits on the

bench, lights a cigarette. Kaufman continues to look at the

ocean, even though he feels the guy's eyes on him. He

doesn't want to engage.

Kaufman nods, looking at the ocean.      Pause.

Kaufman shakes his head "no."   Pause.

CONTINUED:

Pause.

The old guy waits for a response.    He gets none.

Kaufman shakes his head.

CONTINUED: (2)

Kaufman shrugs.

CONTINUED: (3)

MONTAGE

Susan Orlean talks to various orchid enthusiasts, visits

nurseries, sits in lecture halls, attends orchid shows, sits

in the library reading orchid books. She is bored and

distracted.

A stewardess places a cup and an airline-sized bottle of

vodka down in front of a lost Kaufman. He smiles at her.    No

response. He opens the bottle and smells the vodka.

Kaufman enters with his bags and heads to the stairs.

Donald, typing furiously at his desk, looks up.

Kaufman disappears upstairs.

Kaufman tears down MCKEE'S TEN COMMANDMENTS. Donald appears

backlit in the doorway and seems oddly threatening.

They look at each other.    Donald breaks the tension, smiles.

Donald remains on the floor.

MONTAGE SEQUENCE

Mishmash of images: alligators snapping, Laroche jabbering,

Orlean typing, 19th century orchid poachers slogging, orchids

blooming, Mike Owen lecturing.

INT. EMPTY BEDROOM - NIGHT

Kaufman lies half-awake in bed, sweating, his eyes darting

back and forth. He looks over at the clock. It's 3:32.

Donald snores happily off-screen.   Kaufman switches on a

lamp, pulls The Orchid Thief from his bag, flips through it.

There are now many yellow hi-lited passages. He reads one.

Kaufman flips to the glowing, smiling author photo.

He stares at the photo.   Its smile broadens.    It talks.

The photo smiles warmly at him.   Kaufman begins to jerk-off.

He closes his eyes.

Then: Kaufman and Orlean are in his bed together, making

love. She smiles at him throughout. They finish.

Then: Kaufman is alone in bed, heaving. He looks at the

still smiling photo. It somehow seems sleepy now.

CONTINUED:

Kaufman studies her delicate, melancholy face.      He's in love.

INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

Kaufman paces and talks animatedly into his mini-recorder.

Donald enters in his underwear, pours coffee.

Laroche hangs up.   Orlean looks off into the flat distance.

She turns to the camera.

INT. EMPTY BEDROOM - NIGHT

Kaufman holds The Orchid Thief open with one hand and types

with the other.

Kaufman's hand slips, the book shuts. He opens it to the

wrong page and sees an About The Author paragraph. The last

line jumps off the page: "She now lives in New York City with

her husband."

EXT. L.A. STREET - NIGHT

Kaufman wanders the street, distraught.   A passing woman

snickers.

INT. EMPTY BEDROOM - NIGHT

Kaufman types.

INT. EMPTY BEDROOM - MORNING

Kaufman paces with his mini-recorder.    Off-screen typing.

Kaufman is immensely pleased.    He smiles at Orlean's photo.

The phone rings.

CONTINUED:

Sweat appears on Kaufman's brow.

All color drains from Kaufman's face.

Kaufman hangs up and looks at the photo of Orlean. It's

still smiling, but not at him. It's not glowing. Maybe it's

even smirking. Kaufman paces frantically, holding his

stomach. Donald's off-screen typing grows louder.

INT. EMPTY LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Donald types at his desk on his computer.    Kaufman storms in.

CONTINUED:

Kaufman grabs his stomach, doubles over.

INT. EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY

Kaufman is on a gurney and hooked up to an IV. He watches a

slightly haggard woman with a bandaged head sitting in a

small room across the hall. She glances over in his

direction. He smiles. She looks through him.

He lies there for a moment, then his eyes light up.

INT. EMPTY BEDROOM - DAY

Kaufman types passionately on his computer.

INT. AGENT'S OFFICE - DAY

Kaufman, looking tired and wild-eyed, sits with his agent.

turns into a mannequin version.

INT. MIAMI CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

It's an enormous hall filled with people setting up elaborate

The lights are off.   Orlean is in bed, sleeping fitfully.

INT. PLANE - NIGHT

Kaufman reads Ann Landers's column in a paper dated July 4th.

Out the window he sees colorful fireworks far down below,

like small flowers blooming on the black earth. His eyes

well with tears.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Kaufman sleeps fitfully.

EXT. SWAMP - DAY

Orlean walks through alone, panicked. All the vegetation is

greener and crazier-looking than we've seen before. Things

slither by in the water, brush up against her.

CONTINUED:

She tenses, steps into a sinkhole, flails, gets tangled in a

vine, which wraps around her leg as she attempts to extricate

herself. She falls face forward into the black water.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Orlean snaps awake, bedcovers tangled around her legs. She

heaves, looks at the clock. It's 3:30. She stares at the

ceiling. She looks at the clock again. It's 3:30. She

looks at the clock again. It's 4:10. She closes her eyes.

She opens them, looks at the clock, the room is filled with

murky water, the bed an island of dryness. An alligator

pokes its nose out of the water, begins to climb onto the

bed. Orlean jumps back, hits her head on the headboard. The

room is back to normal. The clock reads 4:23. She closes

her eyes. The alarm goes off.

EXT. LAROCHE'S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

Orlean pulls up to the curb where Laroche stands, dressed in

a short sleeve shirt, thin pants, and his Miami Hurricanes

hat. He opens the door and climbs in.

Laroche pulls a new pack of cigarettes out of his pocket.

Orlean turns off the ignition and stares at the steering

wheel. Laroche shrugs.

INT. CAR - A BIT LATER

The sun has come up strong. It looks hot. Laroche speeds

along with one finger on the wheel, paying little attention

to the road. The car veers onto the shoulder, he lazily

corrects it. Orlean is tense.

CONTINUED:

They drive in silence for a little while.   She watches him.

INT. OFFICE - DAY

Orlean types at her desk.   She turns to us and talks.

EXT. MIDTOWN NEW YORK CITY STREET - DAY

Kaufman, sweaty and anxious, walks along. He arrives at the

New Yorker building and enters with steely determination.

INT. BUILDING - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Kaufman waits for the elevator, sweating even more profusely.

The elevator doors open. People get off, people get on, the

elevator doors close. Kaufman still stands there.

EXT. SWAMP - MORNING

Laroche and Orlean step off the levee into black water. They

sink to their knees. The ground is soft; it's a struggle to

pull their feet up to walk. Things slither past in the

water. Something big runs by in the distance. Bees, and

dragonflies hover. Gnats and mosquitoes bite. Birds

screech. Frogs croak. Laroche points to a yellow flower.

Laroche lights a cigarette.

CONTINUED:

Orlean examines it from a distance.

Laroche continues walking and Orlean attempts to keep pace.

He points at a tiny orchid on another tree.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - A FEW MINUTES LATER

A miserable Kaufman sits in the window, sipping coffee and

watching the New Yorker building across the street. He

steels himself, exits the coffee shop.

INT. ELEVATOR - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Kaufman rides up in the crowded elevator. It stops a few

times; people get off and on. Kaufman sweats. The doors

open. The New Yorker logo is painted on the wall opposite

the elevator. Nobody gets off or on. The doors close. The

elevator continues up. Kaufman hates himself. Soon the

elevator is emptied out with the exception of Kaufman. It

begins its descent and stops once again at the New Yorker.

This time Orlean gets on. Kaufman is absolutely panicked.

Orlean looks at him blankly, presses "lobby", and faces

front. Kaufman sweats, studies the back of her head. The

elevator arrives at the lobby. Orlean gets out. Kaufman

hesitates, then follows.

EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - DAY

Orlean walks along.   Kaufman follows her.

EXT. SWAMP - LATE MORNING

The sun is much higher in the sky. Orlean is a sweaty mess,

frizzed hair, anxious, scraped, dirty.

INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

Orlean sits by herself, reading Vanity Fair. Kaufman sits a

few tables away. He scribbles in his notebook.

A waitress brings a tuna sandwich and an ice tea to Orlean.

Orlean looks up from her magazine and smiles at the waitress.

The waitress nods and leaves.   Kaufman scribbles.

EXT. SWAMP - NOON

Orlean follows Laroche. She watches him start off in one

direction, stop, start off another direction, then go

straight ahead. Orlean seems depressed.

Laroche turns and scowls at her.

EXT. NYC STREET - DAY

Orlean window shops at a shoe store.   Kaufman takes notes.

CONTINUED:

Orlean heads down the street. Kaufman follows. She enters

the New Yorker building. Kaufman waits outside.

EXT. SWAMP - DAY

The sun is hot. Laroche is twenty feet ahead of Orlean. She

watches him march forward with great authority. She massages

her eyebrows, leaving a residue of dirt on her face.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Kaufman reviews his notes.       He is sweaty and wild-eyed.

EXT. SWAMP    - LATER

The sun is high. Orlean and Laroche sit on dry ground. She

stares at him. Laroche won't look at her. He busies himself

opening the backpack and pulling out food. Finally, Laroche

speaks without looking up.

Laroche takes out a cigarette, lights it.

He looks up at her, sees her staring at him. He pokes around

on the ground for something, comes up with a straight twig.

Laroche sticks the twig into the ground, stares at it.

Orlean takes a cracker. This relaxes Laroche. He stretches

his legs, knocks over the twig. Without looking at Orlean,

he puts the twig back.

CONTINUED:

Laroche looks down at it.

Orlean stares at the twig in the ground. She looks at

Laroche. Laroche smiles sheepishly at Orlean. Rage and

panic sweep across her face, her fists clench into balls.

Her eyes become wild, some dark fantasy plays out in her

brain. Laroche seems unaware.

Orlean's anger softens.    She looks sadly at Laroche.

They rise.

Laroche points them in a direction and they walk.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

Kaufman is sleeping. It looks like it's been a rough night.

The phone rings. He reaches for it.

CONTINUED:

EXT. NYC STREETS (MONTAGE) - MORNING

Kaufman wanders. He eyes other sad-looking, balding,

overweight men wandering the streets also.

EXT. SWAMP - DAY

Laroche leads the way. There's a sadness, a sense of defeat

and humiliation that he tries to conceal. Orlean is stony.

Laroche leads Orlean back into the brush.

EXT. NYC STREET - MORNING

Kaufman sees a white school building ahead, glowing in the

sun. He walks toward it.

INT. LOBBY - MORNING

The lobby of an auditorium, crowded with enthusiastic people

signing up for something. Kaufman waits in line.    He

watches the handsome guy ahead of him flirt with an

attractive female registrar. The guy moves on and the

attractive registrar looks without interest at Kaufman.

Kaufman averts his eyes from her cool gaze; they come to rest

on a pile of McKee's book Story next to her.

INT. AUDITORIUM - A BIT LATER

Kaufman sits in the packed room.   McKee paces the stage with

a mic clipped to his lapel.

The audience laughs, except for Kaufman who looks pained.

McKee continues to talk but his voice goes under.

Kaufman watches with disdain as people take notes.

Everyone, except Kaufman, laughs giddily at McKee's joke.

The students nod in appreciation at this profundity.

INT. AUDITORIUM - LATER

McKee scribbles a diagram onto a transparency in an overhead

projector. It's some kind of complicated time-line with act-

breaks and corresponding page numbers indicated. The

audience members take copious notes. Kaufman sweats.

Kaufman stops, looks up, startled.    McKee seems to be looking

at him.

Kaufman looks around at people scribbling in notebooks. "Any

idiot..." writes the guy on one side of him. "Flaccid..."

writes the guy on the other side.

EXT. NYC STREET - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Students exit onto the street in small groups. Kaufman

wanders by himself. His face is troubled. There is no sound.

INT. AUDITORIUM - LATER

McKee lectures. Kaufman sits and listens. A copy of

Aristotle's Poetics sits on his lap. The book features a

bust of Aristotle on the cover.

A guy behind Kaufman gives an appreciative "mmmm."

INT. AUDITORIUM - LATER

It's late. The audience is tired, but still attentive. Now

Kaufman takes serious notes. McKee, energetic as ever, wears

his sweater tied around his shoulders. We stay firmly

planted on his face as he talks and talks.

INT. AUDITORIUM - LATER STILL

McKee faces the audience, holding a cup of coffee.

He pauses theatrically, sips his coffee, then:

The overtired audience breaks into uproarious laughter.

Kaufman, with dark circles under his eyes, giggles a little.

INT. HOTEL - NIGHT

Kaufman tosses and turns in bed.

EXT. DREAM-LIKE FIELD - DAY

The daguerreotype Darwin, the Aristotle sculpture, the Hegel

engraving, and the Orlean book jacket photo are alive and in

the middle of brutal and bloody fist fight.

INT. AUDITORIUM - MORNING

Kaufman, bleary-eyed, sits in the back.   McKee paces.

Kaufman timidly raises his hand.

CONTINUED:

EXT. NYC STREET - NIGHT

The last of the students are filing out. Kaufman waits,

leaning against the building. McKee emerges, carrying his

brown leather bag. A shaky, tired Kaufman approaches him.

CONTINUED:

McKee hesitates for a moment, then reaches out and puts his

arm around Kaufman.

EXT. SWAMP - DAY

Laroche and Orlean slog through the water with purpose,

looking only straight ahead. As they walk the sounds and

colors become subdued. Soon there is silence.

They turn left and see metal flashing in the sunlight.

Orlean and Laroche walk toward the car.

INT. BAR - NIGHT

Kaufman and McKee sit at a table with beers.   Kaufman reads

from his copy of The Orchid Thief.

Kaufman closes the book.   There's a pause.

McKee sips his beer, eyes Kaufman.

Tears form in Kaufman's eyes.

McKee smiles.   Kaufman hugs him.   McKee recognizes his bulk.

CONTINUED:

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

A drunken Kaufman paces, tries to read Story. McKee's Ten

Commandments are taped to the wall. As is a photo of

Michelle Pfeiffer ripped from a magazine.

Kaufman is lost.       He rubs his temples.   He dials the phone.

CONTINUED:

INT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

Donald lies on his back on the floor intently reading the

script. Kaufman paces. Donald finishes, is quiet.

CONTINUED:

CONTINUED: (2)

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

The front door opens and Kaufman enters. The lights are off,

but the room is aglow with light from Donald's laptop

computer. Kaufman sees a silhouetted Donald masturbating in

front of the computer. Donald looks up, caught.

Kaufman passes Donald, glances at the grainy nude on the

screen. He's stunned. It's Orlean smiling at him.

Kaufman shows Donald Orlean's book jacket photo.

CONTINUED:

INT. NEW YORK OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

Donald, dressed like Kaufman, waits by the elevators. Orlean

emerges. He's about to talk to her, when she pulls out a

cell phone and dials. Donald decides to be a spy and follows

her out of the building.

EXT. NEW YORK OFFICE BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

Orlean talks on the phone.       Donald trails close behind her.

Orlean stops to look in a shoe store window. Donald stops

and looks in the window also. Orlean doesn't notice him.

Donald walks off.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Donald is focused on the computer. Kaufman sits in a chair

in the corner. Both men are in pajamas.

Donald turns and smiles across the room to Kaufman.

CONTINUED:

Kaufman looks squeamish. Donald picks up a hairbrush, holds

it to his mouth. He starts to sing "Happy Together."

Kaufman smiles sheepishly, shrugs Donald off. Donald

persists. Finally Kaufman joins in. They do the whole

number and fall laughing into each other's arms.

EXT. MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY

Orlean waits with a suitcase outside the terminal. The beat-

up white van pulls up. Orlean gets in, the van speeds off.

Another car pulls away from the curb and follows it.

INT. CAR - A BIT LATER

Donald drives, keeping up with the van, which speeds and

swerves through traffic. Kaufman is sweaty, nervous.

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - LATER

The van pulls into the driveway of a neat, middle-class

house. Kaufman and Donald drive by, in time to see Orlean

and Laroche emerge from the van. Orlean seems different now:

more exotic. She's wearing some kind of sexy sarong. Donald

drives up the street, parks, gets out of the car, and watches

as Laroche lugs Orlean's suitcase into the house.

Kaufman gets out of the car. Donald gets in, peruses

Kaufman's script. Kaufman walks past the house, trying to

peer in windows. He sees nothing. He slinks around back.

CONTINUED:

In the yard, Kaufman finds a greenhouse.    It's filled with

row upon row of ghost orchids.

There's movement in a window in the house.    Kaufman ducks.

Kaufman crawls over to the house, lifts his face to the

window. Orlean and Laroche are laughing, kissing, groping,

and undressing each other. Kaufman is heartbroken but

transfixed. Suddenly Laroche locks eyes with Kaufman.

Laroche jumps up and runs naked to the back door.

Kaufman makes a mad dash around the side of the house.

Laroche cuts him off, grabs him, drags him into the house.

INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Laroche throws Kaufman down into a chair. The chair slides

across the floor, tips over. Orlean seems uninterested. She

kisses Laroche's leg.

Kaufman notices Laroche has a set of beautiful, white teeth.

Laroche shakes Orlean off his leg, kicks Kaufman in the gut.

CONTINUED:

Laroche kicks Kaufman in the head.     Orlean kisses Laroche's

back. Kaufman whimpers.

Again Laroche kicks Kaufman in the head.      His scalp bleeds.

This registers with Laroche.

Orlean is unforgiving.

CONTINUED: (2)

Orlean lies down.   Laroche paces.   Donald peers, unseen, into

the back window.

Donald's eyes widen. Laroche paces. Orlean watches Laroche,

fascinated by his every muscle movement.

Orlean snaps out of her muscle fixation, becomes fixated on

his voice, his lips.

CONTINUED: (3)

Laroche gets ready to kick him again.

Donald disappears from the window.

INT. RENTAL CAR - BEFORE DAWN

Kaufman drives. The headlights shine on Laroche's van ahead.

Orlean, no longer stoned, sits next to him, holding a gun.

She skims Kaufman's screenplay.

CONTINUED:

They drive in silence.    Orlean reads more of the screenplay.

Orlean laughs derisively.

EXT. SWAMP - DAY

Laroche leads Orlean through the swamp. He spots something

on a tree, circles it, and stands there, awestruck. Orlean

comes around and sees a beautiful ghost orchid hanging from

the tree.

Orlean looks at it, tries to feel some passion for it, can't.

CONTINUED:

Laroche pulls a saw from his bag and cuts the branch.

INT. BASEMENT - DAY

There's a makeshift lab. Laroche is extracting some gooey

substance from the nectary.

INT. LAROCHE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Orlean nervously snorts some green powder off the coffee

table while Laroche watches. She talks to the camera.

The drug takes effect and Orlean turns away from us, becomes

fixated on the ghost orchid sitting on the table before her.

She smells it, caresses it, cries at its beauty.

INT. RENTAL CAR - BEFORE DAWN

CONTINUED:

Up ahead, Laroche turns off the road at the Fakahatchee sign.

EXT. JANES SCENIC DRIVE - A LITTLE WHILE LATER

Laroche parks. Kaufman parks behind him. Orlean gestures

with her gun for him to get out. As Kaufman comes around the

car, he sees Donald on the floor of the back seat. Laroche

emerges from his van with a flashlight and a rifle slung over

his shoulder. Orlean prods Kaufman to follow him. Kaufman

shakes and whimpers as they all step down into the thigh-high

water. They slog through silently. Laroche stops.

Laroche paces. Orlean finds a place to sit on a hammock.

She unwraps a small square of paper and snorts something out

of it. Kaufman shivers. Orlean's drugs kick in.

Orlean trails off.    Laroche talks to the spaced out Orlean.

CONTINUED:

Suddenly Laroche gets whacked in the back, flies forward into

the water. Orlean looks up, spaced.    She's confused by a

second Kaufman standing there with a bag of potting soil.

Donald grabs Kaufman and they run back toward the road.

Laroche pulls himself from the water.

She staggers moonily toward Laroche.      He pushes her away.

INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

Kaufman and Donald speed along the swamp road.

Laroche's van pulls close to them and rams them from behind.

It rams them again, this time sending them down into the

swamp. The van stops. Donald tries to back the car onto the

road; the wheels just spin. Laroche steps out of the van.

Kaufman and Donald climb from the car, make their way deep

into the swamp. Laroche follows them in on foot, dragging

Orlean, who is admiring all the plant life.

Laroche shoots at the brothers.    Kaufman whines.

CONTINUED:

Orlean shrugs.

Kaufman and Donald run through a colony of sawgrass. It

slices them like razor blades. Kaufman yells in pain. Blood

oozes through their shirts and pants.

Kaufman and Donald are stopped by a large body of water.

Nowhere to go. Laroche and Orlean close in. The brothers

run along the periphery of the lake. Donald stops.

Kaufman stops, hears a distant galloping and squealing.

The brothers run in the opposite direction. The galloping

gets louder. It's wild pigs. Donald spots an airboat on the

shore. They jump onto it, search hysterically in the dark

for bow to start it.   The pigs get closer. Laroche and

Orlean get closer. Donald finds a button, presses it, the

engine starts. They pull away from the shore just as the

pigs catch up. One pig leaps on board, squealing. Kaufman

kicks at it as Donald attempts to steer the boat. A kick

connects and the pig flies into the water.

CONTINUED: (2)

Laroche stands at the shoreline and fires his rifle. It

nicks the boat. Donald looks back and the boat heads for a

cypress stand.

Donald gets the boat back on course. Laroche and Orlean have

been left far behind. Donald slows the boat.

Suddenly Laroche's van comes tearing around a corner and

speeds along the road at the water's edge. Orlean shoots at

the boat from the van window.

Donald speeds up. The van keeps up, the shooting continues.

Bullets whiz. Kaufman puts his head in his hands. A bullet

hits the airboat's gas tank. It explodes in a ball of flame,

illuminating the whole swamp. Kaufman and Donald are thrown,

along with flaming pieces of debris. Donald treads water,

looks all around for Kaufman.

Underwater. A dazed Kaufman tries to get his bearings. The

murky lake bottom is lit a dim orange by the fire on the

surface. An alligator appears. Kaufman panics, surfaces.

On the surface, Donald spots Kaufman pop out of the water,

then get jerked back down. Donald dives.

Underwater. The alligator violently shakes Kaufman by the

leg. Donald surfaces, comes back down with a broken

propeller blade. He hacks the alligator's head off, grabs

Kaufman, and brings him to the surface.

Donald swims to shore with Kaufman in tow.    Another shot is

fired. It skims the water near Kaufman.

CONTINUED: (3)

Laroche and Orlean circle the lake in the van, shooting.

Mike Owen, in pajamas, leaves his house, jumps in his truck

and agitatedly drives toward the noise and flames.

Donald makes it to shore. He climbs out and is helping

Kaufman, when he gets hit by a bullet and falls.

Kaufman sloshes to shore. His right leg is bloody and

mangled. He lifts his brother's head onto his lap.

Donald touches Kaufman's face. Kaufman looks at his brother.

Donald's face glows radiantly in the fire light.

Donald dies. Kaufman screams heavenward. The van appears

out of the bush, barreling for them. Kaufman rolls his

brother out of the way, and limps off into a slough. The van

follows, smashes into a tree, and comes to a halt.

CONTINUED: (4)

Smoke pours from the grill and is lit by the headlights.         Out

of the smoke, Laroche and Orlean appear with guns. They

follow Kaufman into the swamp.

Mike Owen pulls next to the disabled van. He gets out,

surveys the mess, sees bloody Donald on the ground.

Owen grabs his C.B., tries to radio for help. It's broken.

He lifts Donald into the back of the truck and speeds off.

Kaufman limps through the dark water.       Laroche and Orlean

follow the sound of his sloshing.

Owen tears along the dirt road. Up ahead, Kaufman limps out

of the swamp, into the truck's headlights. Owen is confused.

He checks the back to see if Donald's body is still there and

skids off the road into the swamp. Kaufman hurriedly limps

over to the disabled truck. Owen climbs out.

Before Owen finishes, his truck is flipped over. Donald's

body flies into the water. There, staring Kaufman and Owen

down, is a giant man-like beast. It's repulsive, covered in

algae-matted fur.

CONTINUED: (5)

The two men turn and run.

The creature grabs Owen and snaps his neck like a toothpick.

Kaufman screams as he runs, watches over his shoulder. He

runs right into the arms of Orlean.

Kaufman, Orlean, and Laroche look back. Nothing there.

Laroche puts the gun to Kaufman's head. Kaufman tenses.

Orlean studies Laroche's gun. Her nose is practically

touching the barrel.

Laroche reaches for Orlean's arm to pull her away. Suddenly

the creature grabs Laroche, pulls him into the swamp.

Orlean looks around.

Orlean, agitated and disoriented, fires repeatedly into the

darkness. Something slumps forward in the water. Orlean

steps cautiously over, keeping her gun on Kaufman. The

creature is dead, so is Laroche.

She sits next to Laroche and pets his head.   Kaufman watches

her. The sun is coming up.

Kaufman takes Orlean's chin in his hand and directs her gaze

to him. She stares at him for a long while, then:

Kaufman lets go of her face and sits on a rock.

Orlean stands and walks toward Kaufman.

She paces, unfolds her little square of paper.

Kaufman watches her for a moment.

Kaufman keeps walking.

Orlean screams in anguish. Kaufman keeps walking. Orlean

shakily aims the gun at his back. She shoots. Kaufman

falls, gets up, keeps walking. She aims again through her

tears. Suddenly she's pounced on by a bloody, soaking wet

figure. Kaufman turns.

Kaufman limps back.    Donald and Orlean roll on the ground.

The gun fires. Orlean slumps over Donald. Kaufman arrives.

Both Donald and Orlean are dead. Kaufman falls to his knees.

EXT. SWAMP - MORNING

The sun is high. Fires smoulder. A tow-truck extricates one

He is with a cop and pointing to the bodies spread on a black

plastic tarp.

Kaufman cries a little.    The cop waits sympathetically, then:

Kaufman sits in a booth, working longhand on a legal pad.

He's a little scraped-up, a little tougher. A copy of Story

by McKee is among his reference material. Alice, the

waitress, walks by and glances at the table.

There's a pause.       Alice just stares at him, in awe.

Alice smiles, sits.      The two of them begin to talk.

An enormous chunk of rock, dimly lit by faraway stars, floats

by. Silence.
