OVER BLACK:

The sound of HELICOPTER ROTORS slicing through the air.

FADE IN ON:

An ARMY HELICOPTER as it soars over the thick LOUISIANA BAYOU.

Lush and green only a day ago, the foliage below has been

ripped to shreds. The kind of damage that can only be done

by nature.

SUPERIMPOSE:, FEBRUARY 2 - 0630 HOURS - 32 KILOMETERS NORTH

OF FORT MCKINLEY, LOUISIANA

INT. ARMY HELICOPTER (FLYING) -- SUNRISE

Sitting next to the PILOT is COLONEL WILLIAM STYLES. Mid-

40's, normally gruff, but completely cowed by the damage

below. The PILOT, unfazed.

SOMEONE'S P.O.V. - RUNNING through the underbrush - ducking

branches, pushing through bushes, splashing through streams.

LABORED BREATHING wheezes over the sound track. We're headed

for a CLEARING...

INT. ARMY HELICOPTER (FLYING) -- SUNRISE

The Pilot pushes his stick forward, descending to tree level.

EXT. CLEARING -- DAWN

TWO MEN emerge from the underbrush at a run. The BIGGER MAN

carrying the wounded SMALLER MAN over his shoulder. Both in

ragged army cadet fatigues - ripped, muddy, and bloody.

The Bigger Man lowers the Smaller Man to the ground and

unshoulders his M-16. Face panicked.

The sound of the HELICOPTER approaching...

INT. ARMY HELICOPTER (FLYING) -- SUNRISE

The unmistakable SOUND OF GUNFIRE from below.

As the Helicopter comes over the clearing, Styles and the

Pilot squint down through the windscreen to see the Two Men,

huddled together as BULLET HITS kick up DUST around them!

The Bigger Man raising his own his weapon and RETURNING FIRE.

The Smaller Man frantically waving the Helicopter down...

Below, the Bigger Man still shooting and then he lowers his

rifle and there's only SILENCE. No return fire.

And then Styles sees why. A THIRD MAN. Lying by the

treeline. Chest torn open by gunfire. Obviously dead. His

clothes - the same fatigues the first two men are wearing.

EXT. CLEARING -- SUNRISE

As the Helicopter comes in for a landing, the Bigger Man

kneels next to the Smaller Man, who bleeds from a bullet

wound to the arm.  His face, pale, sweating. The Bigger Man

wipes the Smaller Man's brow and speaks softly and seriously.

The Smaller Man nods.

INT. ROADHOUSE -- MORNING

A full on shit-kicking dive.     Nearly empty, given the hour.

A TELEVISION plays the morning    news over the bar.  Only two

inhabitants - one a BARTENDER,    the other the lone CUSTOMER,

smoking and picking at a plate    of criminally runny eggs.

He grins and we get our first good look at

TOM HARDY - Three day stubble, dark rings around his eyes,

but a with strong jaw and steady voice. Not your average

barfly. Somebody who maybe used to be somebody.

The Bartender takes the plate away from him.

The Bartender smiles.

He stops, his attention suddenly on the TV.    A NEWSCASTER:

The Bartender turns the TV off hastily.   Embarrassed:

Hardy just looks away. The Bartender puts an empty glass

down and fills it to the lip with bourbon.

Hardy nods a "thank you" and reaches for the glass when the

PAGER on his hip goes off. He checks the number.

The Bartender hands him a cordless and Hardy dials.

He hangs up and hands the phone back to the Bartender.

Hardy, obviously shaken by the call.

EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- MORNING

Establishing. A sprawling five square mile compound nestled

in the Louisiana backwoods. Also damaged by the Hurricane.

HELICOPTERS loaded with emergency supplies land and take

off, REPAIR CREWS work feverishly on damaged buildings, all

while CADET PLATOONS complete morning drills around them.

This is still a boot camp after all.

SUPERIMPOSE: 1130 HOURS - FORT MCKINLEY BASIC TRAINING CENTER

EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- MAIN GATE -- MORNING

Styles stands waiting nervously just beyond the CHECKPOINT

with WARRANT OFFICER JULIA OSBORNE - early 30's, attractive,

close cropped hair and icy eyes. In the middle of protesting.

He takes a hit from an ASTHMA INHALER, as a '71 PONTIAC GTO

drives through the gate and pulls up. Hardy emerges.

The two old friends embrace.

Styles looks at the ground.      Momentarily flustered.

Hardy takes off his sunglasses, noticing her.

INT. FORT MCKINLEY -- CORRIDORS MORNING

Hardy follows Styles and Osborne. They pass SOLDIERS

replacing broken windows and sweeping up glass.

Styles' look tells him it is.

Osborne nods, agreeing.

They round a corner.

Styles stops, turning to his friend.

Styles exhales, relieved.

INT. FORT MCKINLEY -- OSBORNE'S OFFICE -- MORNING

Osborne and Hardy enter, stepping over broken glass and

hurricane debris. Hardy looks around.

Osborne opens her mouth to reply but Hardy cuts her off.

Osborne stares at him.    She finally nods.

She starts to go make preparations.

INT. FORT MCKINLEY -- CORRIDOR -- MORNING

As two M.P.'s escort RAYMOND DUNBAR (the "Bigger Man") into

INT. COFFEE ROOM -- MORNING

A small cluttered room with the shades drawn. A folding

table has been set up in the middle of it with a chair on

each side. Dunbar takes a seat in the far chair. Takes in

his surroundings as the MP's leave, locking the door.

INT. FORT MCKINLEY -- CORRIDOR - MORNING

Hardy and Osborne head towards the Coffee Room.

Osborne starts the timer on her digital watch.

INT. COFFEE ROOM -- MORNING

Dunbar looks up as they enter.    Hardy smiles, cheerily.

No response.    Hardy takes a seat across from the cadet.

No response.    Hardy reaches into his pocket.   Pulls out a

DONUT.

Dunbar eyes it, wary but definitely wanting it.

Dunbar grabs the donut, wolfing it down.

No response.    Osborne looks to her watch - it's been a minute.

Dunbar turns away, no longer interested.   Hardy continues:

No response.

Dunbar looks up at this, surprised.

No response.   Osborne looks at her watch - two minutes.

Dunbar, completely confused.

A long silence and then:

Hardy grins as Osborne stops her watch at 2:41.

As they continue, we TRACK under the table to reveal a HIDDEN

MICROPHONE...

INT. STYLES' OFFICE -- MORNING

Styles and an M.P. listening to the Coffee Room conversation.

DUNBAR'S VOICE, over the speaker:

INT. COFFEE ROOM -- MORNING

He Dunbar nods.

Hardy laughs at the memory and turns back to Dunbar.

He looks to the floor.

Dunbar looks back up at Hardy.

INT. STYLES' OFFICE -- MORNING

Styles lowers his head at this.

INT. COFFEE ROOM -- MORNING

No answer.    Hardy rubs his nose.   Osborne steps forward.

Osborne, stunned by this.

Dunbar looks at him good nods slowly.

Hardy smiles at him, gets up, and leaves.

INT. FORT MCKINLEY -- CORRIDOR -- MORNING

Osborne follows him out into the hall where Styles waits.

They stop, looking at each other.

INT. COFFEE ROOM -- MORNING

Hardy returns, another donut in hand, Osborne behind him.

As Dunbar begins to talk, we FLASHBACK...

EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- PARADE GROUNDS -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO

Row upon row of freshly shaven headed CADETS stand at

attention. Their first day of boot camp.

A man with a face of granite strides up and down the lines.

Two ivory handled pistols on his hips. His lifeless cobalt

blue eyes take in the Cadets. This is SERGEANT WEST.

He walks over to a tall black cadet in the front row.   PIKE.

West hauls off and SLAPS Pike across the face!

West grabs Pike by the neck, CHOKING HIM. The others Cadets

GASP. Pike goes down on his knees, the loss of air is so

great. He reaches up automatically to try and save himself...

He KICKS PIKE IN THE BALLS and releases him. Pike goes fetal

on the ground, VOMITING, as West stands over him, screaming.

Pike somehow gets to his feet, vomit streaking his clothes.

Pike, still gasping, can't move fast enough.    West slaps him

again and tears the man's shirt off.

Pike struggles off the rest of his clothes until he is NAKED.

West turns and spies Dunbar in the line.

West draws one of his PISTOLS and gives it to him.

The rest of the Cadets fallout, following West away to one

of the buildings, leaving Dunbar and Pike.

One with a gun, the other naked.

EXT. OBSTACLE COURSE -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO -- MORNING

The CADETS, navigating a log spanned over a PIT OF MUD.

One of the Cadets, a small man named ANDERSON, falls from

the log. Screaming, West dives into the pit and pulls

Anderson out, knocking him on the head with a pistol.

EXT. TARMAC -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO -- AFTERNOON

Anderson stands naked, his arms straining to hold up,TWO

PAINT CANS perpendicular to his body as West berates him.

EXT. MAIN GATE -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO -- NIGHT

Anderson, now in civilian clothes, gets into a TAXI.   Quit.

EXT. FIRING RANGE -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO -- MORNING

West, screaming at a weasely looking cadet named CHILDS.

INT. SECTION EIGHT BARRACKS -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO -- NIGHT

A horribly dilapidated quarters. Four cadets, Dunbar, Pike,

Childs, and MUELLER sleep in rickety bunks.

INT. MESS HALL -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO -- MORNING

The same four Cadets, eating ON THE FLOOR as the other members

of the Cadet Corps chow at tables.

EXT. REGULAR BARRACKS -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO -- EVENING

The four Cadets fallout on a run shirtless, with heavy packs

and rifles held over their heads as the rest of the Cadet

Corps files into their barracks for sleep.

EXT. PARADE GROUNDS -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO -- MORNING

The Cadet Corps, mustered. West zeroes in on NUNEZ (the

"dead one"), whose t-shirt has a spot on it.

West pulls Nunez out of line by his ear and kicks him over

towards a separate muster of our Four Section Eighters.

Nunez takes a place among them.   Looking absolutely terrified.

INT. COFFEE ROOM -- PRESENT DAY

Osborne leans forward.

Dunbar gives a look that almost resembles a smile.

EXT. OBSTACLE COURSE.-- ONE WEEK AGO -- EVENING

The six members of Section Eight on a forced run through the

rain. We focus in each face as Dunbar describes them. First

up is MUELLER a tall Aryan looking blonde with a square jaw.

Muller, grinning, as West kicks his ass to pick up the pace.

Next to him is NUNEZ, a strapping hulk of a manchild.

Next to Nunez is CHILDS, small and weasely with feral eyes.

Behind Childs runs Pike.

Next to Pike, Dunbar and KENDALL run side by side.   Kendall

is short like Childs, but also weak. Wheezing.

Kendall falters and Pike stops to try and help him up. West

smacks the him away, practically kicking Kendall to his feet.

INT. COFFEE ROOM -- PRESENT DAY

Hardy leans back in his chair.

Dunbar studies him for a moment and then pulls a pack of

Dorals from his pocket and puts them on the table.

He takes one and lights it.      Dunbar does the same.

Dunbar just looks at the ground. A KNOCK at the door.    Hardy

and Osborne turn to see an M.P. stick his head in.

INT. FORT MCKINLEY -- CORRIDORS -- MORNING

Hardy and Osborne emerge to find Styles waiting for them.

EXT. ARMY JEEP (MOVING) -- MORNING

Hardy and Osborne sit in the back of the open car as it

rumbles across the grounds, headed towards the Base Hospital.

They sit in silence until:

Osborne looks at him, annoyed.

He slips something into his pocket.

Osborne smiles in spite of, herself.

Osborne laughs.

Osborne studies him.

Hardy just smiles.

They pass an OVERTURNED CLIMBING TOWER.

Hardy doesn't respond, instead looking out as they pass the

SECTION EIGHT BARRACKS.

FLASHCUT TO - FIFTEEN YEARS AGO. A bunch of young Cadets,

Hardy and Styles among them, doing forced push-ups by the

barracks in the rain as West randomly berates and KICKS THEM.

BACK TO HARDY - As he looks away and shakes it off.

INT. BASE HOSPITAL -- RECOVERY UNIT -- DAY

A NURSE leads Hardy and Osborne down a spotless white hall.

INT. BASE HOSPITAL -- KENDALL'S ROOM -- DAY

Kendall lies in a bed, a network of tubes in his arm.   He is

awake but pale, still weak. He studies his visitors.

Kendall's laugh turns into a cough.   Placing Hardy.

Kendall smiles again, not losing any of his cool.

Hardy stares at him for a moment and then gets up to leave.

Nonplussed, Osborne follows.    Hardy turns back at the door.

INT. BASE HOSPITAL -- CORRIDORS -- DAY

Hardy and Osborne walk to the NURSE'S STATION.

He pulls a cigarette from his pocket and lights it.

Osborne just stares at him, not knowing what to say next.

The PHONE at the Nurse's Station rings and a NURSE answers.

Listens for a moment, hangs up, and turns to them.

INT. KENDALL'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY

Hardy and Osborne sit across from Kendall's bed.

Kendall nods.

Kendall hesitates, then nods again.

Kendall takes a breath and begins, all trace of bravado gone.

Kendall stares at them, dead serious.

INT. SECTION EIGHT BARRACKS -- LAST NIGHT

The six Cadets asleep, all except Kendall, who stares up at

the patchwork ceiling.

He leaves as the Sectioners rise, groaning.

Pike pulls on his pants and shoots him the finger.

Mueller and Childs laugh, but Nunez looks concerned.

He stops, listening.    They all hear the WIND, HOWLING outside.

He pulls on his rain poncho and is out the door, Nunez right

behind him. The others, getting ready, all except Kendall.

Dunbar comes over and puts a hand on his shoulder.

EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- TARMAC -- LAST NIGHT

The six cadets, mustered in front of West and a TRANSPORT

CHOPPER. West hands out M-16's, sidearms, and grenades while

yelling above the wind.

Some chuckling.

Mueller groans.

The Cadets board the Transport Chopper. Kendall gets on

last, passing West who leans in and whispers to him:

INT. KENDALL'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- PRESENT DAY

Osborne looks up.

Hardy scratches his temple.

INT. ARMY TRANSPORT HELICOPTER (FLYING) -- LAST NIGHT

On Kendall, sitting among the Sectioners in silence.

terrified he looks like he's about to throw up.

The Chopper touches down on the edge of the BAYOU. The door

rumbles open as West points out different team directions in

the blackness.

The click of rifles being unsafetied as the cadets pour out

of the helicopter.

EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- LAST NIGHT

We track with Kendall and Childs as they head away from the

Landing Zoe, rifles up, heads down, side by side. Moving

the brush quickly and quietly, eyes scanning for targets.

The wind is picking up and it's started to RAIN.   Their

ponchos flap loudly against the elements.

The ROAR of GUNFIRE!  Kendall turns  towards it,  SCREAMING

for a moment... Until he sees Childs  lower his  smoking rifle,

a SHREDDED TARGET on a tree in front  of them.   He looks down,

noticing has his own weapon TRAINED  ON CHILDS.  ..

Childs steps forward, knocking Kendall's rifle away.

Kendall, terrified. Shaking. A beat. Childs picks up the

rifle from the ground and hands it back to him.

VARIOUS SHOTS -- Kendall and Childs, moving through the bayou,

Childs taking out targets. It's raining harder now.

Childs speaks, and Kendall almost jumps out of his skin.

A SOUND from the left. Kendall panics, pivots, and FIRES...

Into DARKNESS. No target, no West, no nothing. Kendall,

really freaked out now.

Kendall nods and lets Childs walk ahead. Staring at Childs'

back as they move on. On Kendall's face, thinking...

CLOSE. ON KENDALL'S FINGER - Clicking off the safety again.

Moving towards the trigger...

Kendall raises the rifle.    Sights Childs' back.      A moment

of utter silence and then...

INT. KENDALL'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- PRESENT DAY

No reply.   Hardy smiles, understanding.

Osborne looks up, surprised.           Kendall nods.

EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- LAST NIGHT

As Kendall safeties his rifle and lowers it... The SOUND of

a tremendous EXPLOSION comes from their right! Kendall and

Childs knocked off their feet as the sky momentarily LIGHTS

UP with the blast as a MAN SCREAMS!

Childs points to the right, where the dim shine of PHOSPHOROUS

can be seen through the trees. He drags Kendall to his feet

and the two take off running towards it.

Kendall panting and scared, ducking branches and leaping

ditches as the two sprint towards the dying glow.

The sound of GUNFIRE!   Childs TACKLES Kendall...

They hit the deck, face down in mud. It takes them a second

to realize the shots are not directed at them.

He trails off. The gunfire and screaming have stopped.

Silence now, save for the wind and rain.

Childs rises and heads towards where the sounds were.

Kendall, lying in the rain and mud, shivering.    Alone.   After

a moment he gets up and follows.

EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- CREEK BED,-- LAST NIGHT

The SCORCHED GROUND and TREES smolder under the rainfall.

Kendall finds Childs, standing down by the creek.

Something lies by his feet.

He stops, seeing.

WEST. Literally spread out on the ground, dead. Eyes open,

face half blackened, he has been ripped in two at the torso.

A horrifying sight. Kendall stumbles back from it.

Kendall can't.   He sits, sobbing.   Part horror, part relief.

Childs pivots at the sound of Mueller coming over the ridge.

Mueller raises his rifle at the weeping Kendall.

Mueller, finally seeming to understand.    Lowering the gun.

Muttering to himself, walking in circles.

No response.

Mueller looks up.

Mueller comes at him, screaming:

Mueller stops, eyes crazed. Childs looks to the sky, which

is becoming worse by the second.

He helps Kendall to his feet.

Kendall nods, slowly.   The two start up the hill.

He points down to West's body.    Childs looks at it.

He and Kendall continue on. Mueller lingers a moment longer

and then turns, following them up the hill.

EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- LAST NIGHT

Kendall, Childs, and Mueller make their way through the bush.

The WIND and RAIN have conspired into a FULL BLOWN HURRICANE.

The three men are practically stumbling now, leaning in

against it to stay on their feet. Kendall spies something

through the maelstrom. It looks like WET WOOD. He points:

THE CABIN -- Wooden, one story, and large, it resembles a

solidly built shack. It is being thrashed by the storm.

The trio stumble towards the front door...

INT. CABIN -- LAST NIGHT

Obviously abandoned. Bare of any furniture save for two

wooden chairs next to an empty fireplace.

DUNBAR and NUNEZ shout in surprise as the three men

practically collapse into the cabin. Dunbar runs to bolt

the door against the elements as Nunez helps them up.

Silence. Dunbar and Nunez stare at him.    Mueller jerks a

hand towards Kendall and Childs.

Mueller stops, as the others turn towards the big man.

Silence. They realize what the question means.

The others nod, becoming convinced.

Mueller angrily digs into his sack and pulls out his grenades.

He stops. Hearing a SOUND outside.        Through the wind and

rain, FOOTSTEPS on the porch.

They all turn to the door.       Waiting...

The DOOR SWINGS OPEN.. Pike.       Covered in BLOOD.

They stare at him as he calmly closes the door and walks

over to the empty FIREPLACE. Finally:

He looks around for kindling.       A beat.

INT. KENDALL'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- PRESENT DAY

Kendall turns to her and smiles.

INT. CABIN -- LIVING ROOM -- LAST NIGHT

Pike, tied to a chair by the fireplace while the others look

for, food in the KITCHEN. Alone, Kendall walks past Pike:

Kendall looks around - there seems no harm in it.

Kendall says nothing. Pike looks around, makes sure no one

is listening and then whispers:

On Kendall, thinking about it.    A beat.

Kendall stares at him.   Disgusted.

He turns and walks away.   Pike watches him go.

INT. CABIN -- KITCHEN LAST NIGHT

Kendall, looking through the empty cabinets for food when

A GUNSHOT -- From the living room. As Kendall bolts towards

the noise, the air is filled with the sounds of SCREAMING

and SHOOTING! He pushes through the door...

INT. CABIN -- LIVING ROOM -- LAST NIGHT

Kendall, coming through the door as we SLO-MO...

Mueller, sprawled out on the floor, dead... Pike, tied to

the chair, bullethole in his forehead... Nunez, wounded,

stumbling out the front door into the hurricane...

And a badly wounded Childs, pistol out, TURNING towards the

SOUND OF THE DOOR and FIRING...

Kendall's arm, HIT with a SLUG, and he starts to go down...

FREEZE-FRAME -- On Kendall's form, falling.

EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- DAWN

The sounds of RUNNING  and HEAVY BREATHING. Kendall's eyes

flutter open. He's on   Dunbar's back, being carried through

the woods. The sound   of GUNFIRE and a TREE BRANCH SHATTERS

next to them. Someone   is chasing them. Trying to kill them.

Nunez.

Dunbar bobs and weaves as another volley of bullets comes

from behind and we can now hear ROTOR BLADES APPROACHING...

EXT. CLEARING -- DAWN

As Dunbar bursts into the sunlight, carrying Kendall.

The entire thing dreamlike, what we saw at the opening, but

from KENDALL'S VIEWPOINT -- the helicopter overhead, Nunez

behind, Dunbar turning and shooting, NUNEZ GOING DOWN...

INT. KENDALL'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- PRESENT DAY

Hardy is silent.    Staring at him.

Silence.   Kendall's got nothing more to say.

Hardy turns back.

Hardy smiles and pushes out the door...

EXT. STYLES' OFFICE -- DAY

Hardy and Osborne stand before the Colonel, filling him in.

Styles turns to Osborne.

Osborne struggles to put it into words.

Osborne turns, making her case to Styles.

They stop arguing, turning to look at him.

A beat. Almost accusingly:

INT. COFFEE ROOM -- DAY

Dunbar looks up as Hardy and Osborne enter.

Hardy leans across the table.

Dunbar stares at him.

Hardy leans across the table, looks Dunbar dead in the eye.

Dunbar stares at him for a moment and then LAUNCHES HIMSELF

at Hardy, SCREAMING. Tackles him to the floor, CHOKING HIM...

Osborne, pulling her sidearm, and PISTOL WHIPPING Dunbar in

the head! Dunbar goes sprawling off Hardy as M.P.'s rush

into the room, RESTRAINING him.

Hardy gets up, gasping, and stumbles to the door.

But he's already gone.

INT. FORT MCKINLEY -- CORRIDORS -- DAY

Hardy, walking angrily towards the front entrance, wheezing

and massaging his neck. Osborne, runninq to catch up.

Styles appears at the end of the hall.

Hardy stares at him. ..

He pushes past a shocked Styles and walks out the door.

EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- PARADE GROUNDS -- DAY

Hardy storms across the grass.   Osborne, still following.

Hardy whirls on her.

A beat.   Osborne shakes her head.

Hardy stares at her.

Hardy looks at the ground.

Hardy looks back up at her.     Speaking softly:

They stare at each other for a moment...

INT. COFFEE ROOM -- DAY

Hardy and Osborne enter to find Dunbar in SHACKLES.

INT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- CREEK BED -- LAST NIGHT

Dunbar and Nunez RUNNING towards the glow of phosphorous and

sound of GUNFIRE. They come over the hill to see Childs and

Kendall, standing over WEST'S BODY. Dunbar stops, shocked.

Dunbar edges closer, looking at West.   With BULLET HOLES.

His chest, riddled.

INT. COFFEE ROOM -- PRESENT DAY

INT. CABIN -- LAST NIGHT

Dunbar, Kendall, Childs, and Nunez push through the door to

find Mueller in his undershirt, a FIRE burning in the hearth.

INT. COFFEE ROOM -- PRESENT DAY

INT. CABIN -- LAST NIGHT

Mueller looks down, scared.

Mueller shows his three grenades to the others.

INT. COFFEE ROOM -- PRESENT DAY

INT. CABIN -- LAST NIGHT

Pike, staggering in through the door. The others get up

from where they are sitting - it's been awhile since they

arrived. Pike shouts at Mueller:

A beat.

Silence.   All of them staring at Pike.

Pike, suddenly understanding.      Fear creeping into his face.

He moves to the door, but. . .

Nunez, with his PISTOL out.      Trained on Pike.

The CLICK as Nunez pulls back the pistol's hammer.

Pike stares at them and then throws his pack down, angrily.

Dunbar goes to it, opens it, and reaches in. Pulls his hand

out. Only TWO GRENADES. Looks at Pike. Sadly.

INT. CABIN -- LAST NIGHT

Later. The fury of the storm has increased. Kendall, Childs,

Nunez, and Mueller, in the KITCHEN looking for food.

IN THE LIVING ROOM

Pike, tied to the chair. Dunbar sitting in a corner,

listening to the hurricane rage outside. Pike watches him.

A CREAKING as the cabin SHIFTS on it's foundation.   Dunbar

looks up at the roof, scared. It holds.

Dunbar doesn't reply. Still staring nervously at the roof.

Pike looks to make sure the others out of earshot, then:

No reply.

Pike takes a deep breath.

Dunbar starts to get up.

Dunbar stares at him.

Dunbar walks over to Pike's pack and unzips it.    Checks the

little pocket. Pulls out a VIAL and a SYRINGE.

Dunbar does to reveal a cluster of TRACK MARKS.

Dunbar sits down.   Not knowing what to say.

INT. CADET SHOWERS -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO

Empty except for Pike. He sits, nude, curled up on the tile,

as the nozzles blast STEAMING WATER down onto his shivering

form. FOOTSTEPS approaching. Mueller. He leans down next

to Pike, speaking to him. Kindly.

As Mueller produces a SYRINGE from his pocket...

INT. BASE PX -- BACKROOM -- SIX WEEKS AGO

A covert meeting among stacks of supplies. Childs stands

with Mueller, talking to a gaunt Pike. Behind Pike are a

group of other SICKLY LOOKING CADETS, all jonesing.

Pike hands the smiling Mueller a WAD OF CASH...

INT. CABIN -- LAST NIGHT

Dunbar staring open mouthed at Pike.    Shocked.

A beat.   Dunbar gets to his feet.

Dunbar looks.   Not a speck of blood on it.

Dunbar looks over to fireplace, where ashes are smoldering...

FLASHCUT TO - When Dunbar first entered the Cabin: Mueller,

standing there in a T-SHIRT, a FIRE burning in the hearth.

INT. TRANSPORT HELICOPTER (FLYING) -- EARLIER LAST NIGHT

The Sectioners sit, stonefaced, staring out the window.

CLOSE ON - Mueller's hand as it snakes into Pike's pack and

extracts a phosphorous grenade.

EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- EARLIER LAST NIGHT

Mueller and Pike, twenty feet apart, scouring the brush for

targets. Mueller looks to Pike and then slips away...

EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- CREEK BED,-- EARLIER LAST NIGHT

Mueller stands on the hill and pulls the grenades pin, tossing

it down the embankment. ..

The grenade BLOWS, setting the entire area AGLOW...

EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- EARLIER LAST NIGHT

Kendall and Childs, turning towards the sound...

Note: Each shot of Kendall and Childs in this sequence should

correspond exactly to Kendall's Flashback.

EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- CREEK BED -- NIGHT

West emerges from the bush at a sprint.

Mueller runs down the embankment toward him.

Six feet away from West, Mueller suddenly raises his rifle

and PULLS THE TRIGGER.

EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- EARLIER LAST NIGHT

Kendall and Childs, running in the direction of the grenade...

Suddenly MACHINE GUNFIRE shatters the night!

He tackles Kendall into the mud.

EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- CREEK BED -- EARLIER LAST NIGHT

Mueller, smoking rifle in hand, uniform covered in blood

stands over WEST'S DEAD BODY. He turns and runs off INTO

THE BRUSH. A moment later, Childs and Kendall come into

view at the top of the embankment...

INT. CABIN -- EARLIER LAST NIGHT

Mueller, still covered in blood, enters the dark cabin. He

strips of his shirt and throws it in the fireplace. Striking

a match, igniting the bloody rag... .

Mueller, watching the evidence burn...

INT. CABIN -- LAST NIGHT

Pike sighs, finished with his story.

The hurricane outside GROWING LOUDER as the Cabin ROCKS again.

The sound of WOOD SNAPPING. Pike stares up at the roof.

The cabin SHIFTS again.     Dunbar stares at him.

Dunbar doesn't move.

A long beat.   The two men stare at each other.

And then Dunbar pulls his knife from his boot and leans down

to cut Pike's bonds.

Dunbar freezes.   Caught.

He looks to the open kitchen door where Mueller stands.

The others enter the room. Dunbar, kneeling there, knife

inches away from severing Pike's ropes.

The others stare at Dunbar.

Childs motions to Dunbar.

He's serious.    Dunbar moves away from Pike.

The others begin to look at Mueller with new eyes.

The hurricane, reaching FEVER PITCH outside as WATER begins

leaking in through the roof.

PIKE TURNS TO MUELLER:

Mueller pulls his SIDEARM and POINTS IT AT PIKE.

Pike, EYES LOCKED with Mueller.    Continuing:

Pike leans forward.

And Mueller FIRES.

Pike's head SNAPS BACK.

The gunshot, DEAFENING.    Then, for an eternity, SILENCE.

Nobody moves.   Nobody breathes.   As if time has stopped.

Mueller lowers his arm, the pistol clattering to the floor.

His face, as shocked as the others.

He takes a step forward towards Pike.    A hole in the middle

of the black man's forehead.

Almost mechanically, Dunbar begins to reach for his own gun...

The unmistakable sound of a two rifles' magazines being RACKED

simultaneously. Dunbar turns to see Childs and Nunez, their

M-16's in hand. Levelled at him.

Dunbar does.    Looks to Nunez.

Mueller collapses on the ground.   Head in hands.

Dunbar and Kendall, looking at each other. It's clear what

the wrong answer will mean. A long beat, until

He is cut off as the WIND outside ROARS - the HURRICANE

mounting to it's FULL FORCE - and the WINDOWS BLOW INWARDS,

showering Childs, Mueller, and Nunez with glass!

Dunbar's hand flies to his pistol, PULLING IT...

Mueller, SCREAMING, trying to claw the glass from his EYES...

Childs, seeing Dunbar move, PULLS THE TRIGGER. .. .

And the cabin is filled with the THUNDER OF GUNFIRE as Kendall

goes down, clutching his ARM...

DUNBAR FIRES, hitting Childs directly in the chest...

Childs, still shooting, falls back, his random spray of

bullets PUNCHING INTO MUELLER who jerks like a marionette...

Nunez, drawing a bead on Dunbar, about to shoot, when...

A great CRESCENDO of WOOD SPLINTERING and SUPPORTS BUCKLING

overtakes them and the CABIN'S ROOF COMES DOWN ON THEIR HEADS.

EXT. DEMOLISHED CABIN -- FIRST LIGHT

Hours later. The rain has lessened and the Hurricane has

begun to lift as Dunbar pulls himself from the debris.

Hearing a FAINT CRY from his left.

Kendall.   Half conscious, his arm, bloody.

Dunbar slings the man across his shoulders as the rising sun

begins to peak through the clouds overhead.

EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- SUNRISE

Dunbar, carrying Kendall towards the clearing when GUNFIRE

comes from behind. He turns to look...

Nunez. The only other survivor from the Cabin. A hundred

yards back, rifle in hand, coming after them with a vengeance.

Dunbar, sprinting towards the clearing, bullets at his heels

and as he bursts from the tree line he looks up to see a

HELICOPTER OVERHEAD

FLASHCUT TO - Nunez, chest blown open, going down...

INT. COFFEE ROOM -- PRESENT DAY

And we're back to the interrogation. Dunbar, stubbing out a

cigarette and looking up at Hardy and Osborne.

Osborne blinks, like a trance has been broken.

She goes over to the machine and pours a cup.

Osborne hands him the coffee.

Their faces say "no".   Osborne spreads a MAP out on the table.

EXT. FOR MCKINLEY -- CORRIDORS -- DAY

Hardy and Osborne, walking and talking.

INT. STYLES' OFFICE -- DAY

Hardy and Osborne stand in front of an agitated Styles. He

tries to take a hit off his asthma inhaler and gets nothing.

Frustrated, he tosses it away.

A beat.

Hardy lays a piece of paper on Styles' desk.

Styles looks at it and then slowly up to Hardy.

Hardy nods, agreeing.   Styles stares at them.

Styles nods and looks to his desk.      Almost to himself:

He looks back up at Hardy.      His eyes, steeled.

INT. KENDALL'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY

Kendall lies in his bed, looking worse than before.   Hardy

and Osborne enter.

Osborne looks to her watch.   Kendall notices.

Kendall begins coughing.

Hardy sighs and goes to the sink to get him some water.

He returns with a GLASS OF WATER and hands it to Kendall.

Silence. They wait for Kendall's reaction. He looks

momentarily flustered by this... and then he smiles.

Hardy doesn't know what to say.   That was his ace card.

Osborne furrows her brow at this as Hardy continues.

Osborne turns to Hardy.

EXT. BASE HOSPITAL -- CORRIDOR -- DAY

Osborne and Hardy, exiting the room.      Whispering:

She grins.    He grins back.

INT. KENDALL'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- DAY

Hardy and Osborne reenter, smiling.      Kendall chuckles.

Hardy pulls the out MICRORECORDER and hands it to Osborne.

Smiling, she stops the tape.    Then turns to Kendall.

Osborne laughs.

She finishes, breathing hard. Kendall, totally cowed. Hardy,

trying to suppress a smile. Osborne rises for the door.

Silence.   Kendall takes a deep breath.

Osborne holds up the microrecorder and starts the tape again.

Kendall stares at the recorder.   A long pause.

He pauses, taking a shaky sip of water.

EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- CREEK BED -- LAST NIGHT

West stands in front of Childs and Kendall, facing them.

Kendall opens his mouth to speak, but Childs steps forward

and raises his rifle, FIRING...

INT. KENDALL'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- PRESENT DAY

INT. CABIN -- LAST NIGHT

As they TIE PIKE to the, chair.

Childs gives Kendall a look that says "Stay quiet".

Pan over to Dunbar, who binds his friend, sadly.

EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- LAST NIGHT

Dunbar pulls Kendall from the cabin's wreckage. As Kendall

begins to talk to him, Dunbar's eyes widen in shock. ..

INT. KENDALL'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- PRESENT DAY

Kendall nods.   Crying a little.

Kendall says nothing.

EXT. CLEARING -- EARLIER THAT MORNING

The helicopter, hovering overhead. Dunbar, carrying Kendall,

spinning his rifle to face Nunez, sixty yards away. Dunbar

hesitates before firing, not wanting to...

Dunbar's rifle ERUPTS...

INT. KENDALL'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- PRESENT DAY

Kendall finishes, wiping his face.    Osborne turns to Hardy.

Hardy smiles and gets up.   Walking slowly to Kendall's bed.

Kendall nods, still a little teary.

FLASHCUT TO - NUNEZ, in the creek bed, SHOOTING WEST.

FLASHCUT TO - Now DUNBAR, SHOOTING WEST.

FLASHCUT TO - KENDALL, SHOOTING WEST.

Kendall, crying harder now, beginning to shake.

And then. His mouth SLAMS SHUT. Teeth cracking together

over and over again like a metronome on speed, and his body

JERKS HORRIBLY, going horizontal, SHAKING VIOLENTLY!

Osborne, leaping to her feet.

Hardy grabs a fork from the bedside table and tries to shove

it into Kendall's chattering mouth. His teeth, CLAMPING

DOWN on the metal and Hardy's hand, drawing blood.

The Nurse bursts into the room.

The Nurse runs to the bed, pushing Hardy aside. As more

MEDICAL PERSONNEL runs into the room, they usher Hardy and

Osborne to the door.

Osborne tries to move to him, but the Doctor blocks her path.

Osborne knocks the Doctor down and runs to Kendall's side.

Kendall looks up, focusing on Osborne, a slight moment of

clarity in his eyes.

And relapses into ANOTHER FIT as SECURITY GUARDS drag Hardy

and Osborne from the room.

INT. BASE HOSPITAL -- WAITING ROOM -- DAY

Later.   Hardy and Osborne sit in silence, eyes downcast.

Waiting. Hardy pulls his last cigarette from the pack, lights

it, crumples the pack and tosses it into a garbage can.

Hardy looks up at her and nods.

She looks back to the floor. Hardy takes a drag from the

cigarette, and then tosses that away too.

The door opens and Styles walks into the room.    Somber.

He sighs and takes a seat next to them.

Hardy says nothing.

Styles nods, understanding.

Hardy gets up to go and then stops.   Realizing something.

He points to Kendall's hospital room.

Hardy smiles.

EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- PARADE GROUNDS -- EVENING

The sun, beginning to dip in the sky, as Hardy and Osborne

exit the hospital.

They walk in silence, for a bit.

They pass a GROUP OF CADETS doing drills.    Hardy, watching

them. Almost looking wistful.

INT. MOTOR POOL -- EVENING

Hardy and Osborne make their way towards Hardy's car.

Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries.

Osborne turns to the DUTY SERGEANT.

The Sergeant nods, walking up with a clipboard.

Hardy signs the clipboard and hands it back.

The Sergeant scratches his head.

Hardy and Osborne stare at him.    Shocked

A beat.

EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- PARADE GROUNDS -- EVENING

CADETS SCATTER as Hardy's car ROARS OUT OF THE MOTOR POOL,

PEELING across the grass towards the far side of the base!

Hardy, white knuckling the wheel, doing his best to steer

around anyone who can't get out of the way in time.

EXT. FORT MCKINLEY RUNWAY FOUR -- EVENING

A Large TRANSPORT PLANE sits on the runway waiting as three

M.P.'s and a JAG LAWYER lead Dunbar/Pike (who, for purposes

0 continuity, we will continue to call DUNBAR) out to it.

The SQUEAL OF TIRES as Hardy's car SLIDES around the corner

of the nearest building and SCREECHES to a halt by the plane.

Hardy and Osborne, leaping out, running towards Dunbar and

the M.P.s.

Hardy grabs Dunbar by the arm.

As the M.P.'s grab Hardy, dragging him away. Osborne, trying

to stop them. Dunbar, climbing the stairs onto the plane...

Osborne pulls her SIDEARM, levelling it at him as Hardy yells:

Dunbar stops at the hatchway. Slowly turning back to them.

Seeing the gun. The M.P.'s release Hardy. Nobody moves.

INT. COFFEE ROOM -- EVENING

Hardy and Osborne roughly lead Dunbar into the room, the JAG

Lawyer trailing behind, shouting:

She slams the door and BARRICADES it.    Turns to Hardy.

Hardy practically throws Dunbar into a chair.

FLASHCUT TO - WEST on the parade grounds, now strangling

DUNBAR on the first day...

FLASHCUT TO - Now DUNBAR in the showers as MUELLER hands him

a syringe...

Hardy steps forward and RIPS OPEN Dunbar's right sleeve,

revealing the TRACK MARKS.

INT. CABIN -- LAST NIGHT

Dunbar standing in the Cabin; Mueller, Childs, and Pike,

dead at his feet.

He stares down at the bodies in the cabin, his eyes focusing

on the black man's uniform. The name on it reads - "DUNBAR".

As he reaches for it...

INT. COFFEE ROOM -- PRESENT EVENING

Dunbar looks at them.   One to the other.   Slowly.

He reaches under the table and rips out the HIDDEN MICROPHONE.

Hardy and Osborne exchange an uneasy glance.

Dunbar chuckles at the bluff.

Hardy, knowing he's right. In a flash he reaches down PULLS

OSBORNE'S GUN and grabs Dunbar, SLAMMING him up against the

wall, pressing the weapon TO HIS TEMPLE!

A POUNDING on the locked door.    Hardy ignores it.

Hardy COCKS the pistol as Dunbar screams:

A CRASH as the door's lock SNAPS and M.P.'s POUR into the

room! Styles and the JAG Lawyer behind, taking in the scene.

Hardy releases Dunbar, who slides to the floor, gasping.

As the M.P.'s grab Hardy and Osborne, pulling them away...

He breaks down sobbing.   Styles holds up a hand to the M.P.'s.

The JAG Lawyer glowers as the M.P.'s stand down.   Dunbar

tries to pull himself together. To Hardy:

INT. CADET SHOWERS -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO

Mueller showing the syringe to the naked Dunbar.   Dunbar's

voice over speaks in unison with Mueller:

INT. COFFEE ROOM -- PRESENT EVENING

INT. SECTION EIGHT BARRACKS -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO

Dunbar, alone, sleeve rolled up, arm tied off: Sliding the

needle into his vein...

He hits the plunger, injecting.   His face goes tranquil.

INT. COFFEE ROOM -- PRESENT EVENING

He takes a deep breath, looking at them.

INT. SECTION EIGHT BARRACKS -- LAST NIGHT

West, entering the,barracks, shouting the cadets awake.

EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- TARMAC -- LAST NIGHT

The cadets, climbing aboard the chopper.

INT. CABIN -- LAST NIGHT

The six men stand in rigid formation, eyes on West.

He walks down the line of the six men, eyeing each of them.

Finally stopping at one. Putting a hand on his shoulder.

Nunez.

He points to the door. The hurricane, RAGING outside.   Nunez

looks to the others, then the door, and understands.

He takes off running out the door.       Gone.

West walks over to a table covered with a tarp. Pulls the

cloth aside to reveal M-16's, PISTOLS, and GRENADES.

The remaining five cadets, understanding there is no place

for friendship or kindness here. This is life and death.

They walk to the table and gear up.

EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- LAST NIGHT

Lightning, thunder, and rain as Nunez runs unarmed through

the thick brush.

SOMEWHERE BEHIND HIM - The other five fan out, rifles up,

following his trail, ready to kill.

ON MUELLER

Making his way down embankment, M-l6 out, ready for anything.

From behind him, MOVEMENT...

Nunez TACKLES HIM at full speed, feet SLIPPING on the wet

hill, and the two TUMBLE head first into a GULLY. Punching,

kicking, biting, anything to stop the other man.

Nunez, CHOKING Mueller as he strains to reach his gun...

With a HEAVE, Nunez SNAPS HIS NECK.        Mueller lies still.

Nunez spins, seeing CHILDS BEHIND HIM. He DIVES as Childs

fires! Hits the ground in a roll, comes up with Mueller's

rifle, and SHOOTS - BLOWING CHILDS BACK against the wet rocks.

Nunez slumps against the gully's wall, breathing hard.          In

agony over what he's just had to do.

Closing his eyes, Nunez steels himself. Wipes the blood

from his hands and climbs out of the gully.

ELSEWHERE

PIKE, creeping through the foliage. Trying to listen for

sounds of movement through the storm. His eyes narrow as he

hears a HIGH PITCHED WHINE...

The bullet hits his forehead dead center.        He crumples.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL - Nunez in a tree, thirty meters away.

Lowering his rifle.      He climbs down.

TIME CUT TO:

Dunbar and Kendall come upon Pike's fallen form. They gaze

down at the uniform emblazoned with the name "DUNBAR".

As he reaches down for the uniform, a SHOT RINGS OUT.

KENDALL FALLS, wounded in the arm. Dunbar raises his rifle

to find Nunez, standing ten yards away, gun trained on him.

YELLING OVER THE HURRICANE:

A Mexican stand-off.   The rain continues to fall.

Nunez shakes his head.

Dunbar, torn. He can't bring himself to shoot, but he can't

surrender either.

Silence.   The two men still facing each other.

Nunez laughs.

More silence.   Neither moves.    The sky above, a maelstrom.

Nunez, staring at him.     Deciding.

Dunbar nods.

Nunez begins backing away, rifle still trained on him.

And then Dunbar spies something behind and to the left of

Nunez...

West.

Staring down at him from behind some brush.       Watching.

Nunez, slowly backing away. He pauses as his foot catches

on a fallen branch. Looks away from Dunbar for a split second

to step over it...

West nods to Dunbar as if to say "Go on. . . "

And Dunbar FIRES.

Nunez, caught by the burst, GOES DOWN. The echo of the

gunshots, swallowed by the storm. Dunbar lowers his head in

agony. West walks down.

Dunbar stares at his Sergeant through the rain.

West smiles.   Tilts his head to Kendall.

Dunbar doesn't move.

Dunbar doesn't reply.   West laughs and flips him a salute.

And West turns and walks away, stepping over Nunez.   Giving

Dunbar a clear shot at his back.

Dunbar raises his rifle, wanting, needing, dying to shoot

the old man...

But he can't.   West disappears into the bayou.

A GROAN from the ground. Kendall. Dunbar's reverie broken,

he leans down, beginning to unbutton the Dunbar Uniform...

INT. COFFEE ROOM -- PRESENT EVENING

Dunbar stubs out a cigarette, finished. Hardy, Osborne,

Styles, and the JAG Lawyer gaping at what he has just said.

The JAG Lawyer steps forward.

Dunbar says nothing.

Silence.   The JAG Lawyer looks to Hardy, all anger gone.

Hardy nods. Dunbar rises and slowly walks to the door.

Turning back to Hardy.

Hardy shakes his head, sadly.

They leave.   Styles walks over to Hardy.

Hardy holds up a hand, cutting him off. Styles nods,

understanding, and leaves, closing the door behind him.

Hardy and Osborne stand there.   Not speaking.    It's done.

INT. FORT MCKINLEY -- OFFICER'S CLUB -- NIGHT

Several hours and bourbons later, Hardy sits at the bar,

drunk and alone. Out of place, the only one not in uniform.

Osborne walks in, locates Hardy, and strides over to the

bar, a sheaf of papers under her arm. Her face, stoic.

He takes a slug of his drink.

He chuckles.

Osborne looks at him.    Realizing what he's saying.

He pours himself another drink.

Osborne stares at him.

He takes a slug from his glass and grimaces.

Hardy stares at her.

He motions to the bartender for another glass, but Osborne

takes his hand, stopping him.

Hardy looks at her, questioning.   Osborne takes a deep breath.

Hardy stares at her.

She puts the papers on the bar.

She taps the bottom of the paper. Hardy, not wanting to

believe it. He looks up at her, pained.

Hardy stares at his glass.   Deciding.

INT. STYLES' OFFICE -- NIGHT

Styles, finishing his paperwork. He rises and turns off his

desk light, bathing the office in DARKNESS. He's about to

leave when he notices a SILHOUETTE in the doorway.

Styles squints at the figure.

Hardy steps forward, into the office.

You couldn't let him testify, could you?

Styles, realizing what Hardy's talking about.

He begins to move from behind his desk.

Hardy throws the papers onto Styles' desk.

He walks towards the desk.

In the darkness we see Styles MOVE SUDDENLY...

Hardy DIVES to the floor - Osborne in the doorway, PISTOL

raised, FIRES TWO SHOTS! Muzzle flare lighting the room for

a split second as Styles is BLOWN BACK against the wall!

Hardy gets to his feet and flicks on the LIGHT. Styles lies

slumped in the corner, two holes in his chest. Dead.

Osborne lowers her weapon, shaking.

Hardy points to the top desk drawer, which is open. Inside

it sits an IVORY HANDLED PISTOL. Fully loaded, safety off.

It's presence tells them everything they need to know.

Hardy nods and then turns to look down at Styles' body.

EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- PARADE GROUNDS -- NIGHT

The aftermath. Flashing blue and red lights from parked

Military Police vehicles illuminate the grounds as M.P. 'S

string crime scene tape around the front entrance of the

building, securing the site for investigation.

Hardy takes in the entire scene from afar. Standing by his

GTO, watching as several M.P.'s finish questioning Osborne.

When she's done she spies Hardy and walks over to him.

Osborne smiles.

Hardy pulls a card from his pocket and hands it to her.

A beat.

She nods.   An awkward moment.      Finally:

He turns away.   Walking towards his car.

He turns back. She walks up and holds something out to him.

A ten dollar bill.

He looks down at the money.

He takes the bill and Osborne laughs. He climbs into his

car and starts it. Grinning at her through the open window.

He puts the GTO in gear and drives off. She watches him go,

then looks down at his card. Smiling. Maybe she will call.

INT. OSBORNE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

A bottle of Scotch at her side, Osborne slips a tape marked

"BASIC TRAINING INTRO - SGT. N. WEST" into her VCR. Settles

back to watch it. West's face fills the screen.

INT. HARDY'S GTO (MOVING) -- NIGHT

It's started to rain.    Hardy drives in silence.

A HITCHHIKER up ahead.    Hardy pulls over for him.

INT. OSBORNE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

Osborne, drinking and watching.

INT. HARDY'S GTO -- NIGHT

The Hitchhiker gets into the car.

Hardy, smiling at him, because the Hitchhiker is not a

Hitchhiker at all...

The Hitchhiker is Dunbar.

EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- CREEK BED -- LAST NIGHT

24 hours ago. The hurricane rages. A HAND pulls the PIN on

a phosphorous grenade and CHUCKS IT.

It blows, frying brush and nothing more.

West comes over the hill, running to investigate. He stops

at what he sees. Nunez stands unarmed in the creek bed,

SURROUNDED by the other Section Eight Cadets. A prisoner.

West doesn't move. Kendall walks over and DISARMS West,

pushing him into the circle next to the terrified Nunez.

Dunbar raises his rifle and SHOOTS NUNEZ. He goes down,

twitches once and lies still. Dead. West looks at Dunbar.

And with that, Tom Hardy emerges from the brush carrying, a

COMBAT KNIFE. West's eyes sparkle with recognition.

Hardy just smiles.

Moving faster than   West thought imaginable, Hardy moves and

the knife FLASHES,   CUTTING WEST OPEN stem to sternum. Hardy

grips the older man   by the shoulders, lowering him to the

ground as he dies.    Whispering in his ear:

And WEST DIES. A moment of utter silence and then VOICES

FROM THE PAST begin coming back to us:

Kendall walks over to Hardy and hands him a PISTOL.

Kendall holds out his arm, gritting his teeth...

And Hardy SHOOTS Kendall once, THROUGH THE ARM.

EXT. CLEARING -- THIS MORNING

Mueller and Childs lay NUNEZ's DEAD BODY out in the brush.

The sound of the Helicopter approaching...

TIME CUT TO:

Dunbar raises his rifle and FIRES towards the tree line.

Aiming at nothing. The Helicopter comes into view overhead.

DUST KICKS UP around Dunbar and Kendall - bullet hits.

ON STYLES' FACE - Watching this through the windscreen.

RACK FOCUS TO - Hardy, concealed in the woods, FIRING at

Dunbar and Kendall's feet to simulate Nunez shooting at them.

Dunbar, shooting towards where Nunez's body lies. Making it

look like he just killed Nunez.

EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- THIS MORNING

EXT. ROADHOUSE PARKING LOT -- PRESENT NIGHT

The GTO pulls into a space and Hardy and Dunbar get out.

They walk towards the bar's entrance.

As Hardy and Dunbar push through the doors into the bar...

INT. ROADHOUSE -- NIGHT

A table of FOUR MEN look up as Hardy and Dunbar enter.

Mueller, Childs, Pike, and the Motor Pool DUTY SERGEANT.

All drinking beer, having a grand old time.

Hardy and Dunbar smile and go to join them.

INT. OSBORNE'S APARTMENT -- PRESENT NIGHT

As the taped West concludes his speech.

The screen cuts to STATIC. Osborne turns off the TV,

extinguishing the last source of light. OVER THE DARKNESS:

EXT. ROADHOUSE PARKING LOT -- NIGHT

Silence.   We slowly move towards Hardy's parked GTO...

Focusing on the TRUNK...

INT. GTO TRUNK -- NIGHT

WEST'S BODY, stuffed into the trunk of Hardy's car.

EXT. CLEARING -- THIS MORNING

Dunbar lays the wounded Kendall down as the Helicopter

carrying Styles comes in for a landing. Dunbar wipes the

sweat from Kendall's brow and asks him seriously:

ROLL CREDITS

FADE OUT
