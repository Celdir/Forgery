FADE IN...

EXT. 124 BLUESTONE ROAD - DAWN.

It is winter in Ohio. A house sits isolated beside a barren

field. The field stretches beyond, until a line of distant

woods stops it. Around the back of the house stands a rundown

STORAGE SHED, a cold house, a privy and a water pump. A porch

with a single door serves as the only entrance.

Camera begins a slow move toward the house as we;

SUPER - OHIO, 1865

WE HEAR SOUNDS from inside the house - BUMPS, A CHAIR FALLING

OVER...and FEET RUNNING on wooden floor boards.

INT. 124 BLUESTONE ROAD - DAWN.

C.U. - THE HANDS OF TWO BROTHERS HOLDING EACH OTHER AS THEY

RUN DOWN THE STAIRS..

BULGAR (13 yrs. old) and HOWARD (14 yrs. old) run down the

steps from the second floor. They are fully dressed, carrying

a small bag of belongings.

Bulgar reluctantly lets go of Howard's hand as the latter

runs into the kitchen. Alone, he edges towards the front

door, when suddenly;

THE DOOR SLOWLY CREAKS OPEN on it's own. Scared, he steps

away slowly.

INT. KITCHEN - DAWN.

Howard is trying to toss some food into a bag. He spots A

CAKE sitting on top the wooden table, with some pieces

already eaten. He finds a knife and approaches the table.

He is about to cut into the cake when he sees TWO TINY HAND

PRINTS appear on the cake's surface. Howard stops cold -

dropping the knife.

INT. FRONT ENTRANCE - DAWN.

Howard exits the kitchen and takes Bulgar's hand;

The boys look up the stairs and see their baby sister, nine

year old DENVER.

The brothers are brokenhearted at the sight of her. They love

their sister. But there are stronger forces here.

A MIRROR on a wall beside Howard cracks down the middle.

Bulgar looks up to Denver. They exchange a look of deep

affection and pained longing. He wants to take her.

Bulgar is starting to cry. He rushes up the steps and hugs

his sister. He kisses her hard then breaks away. Denver's

outstretched hand misses his shirt and hangs mid-air.

Bulgar flies down the steps and disappears out of the house

holding Howard's hand once more.

Denver sits alone at the top of the stairs.  She sadly looks

up and weeps, as if to the house itself:

EXT. ROAD TO THE TRAIN - DAWN.

THE VOICE OF SETHE HUMMING A MELODY carries over the images

of:

The two boys running for their lives towards the train,

holding hands all the way.  Howard is the first to reach it.

As it passes by, he throws his bag upon it and jumps in.

Bulgar races beside it as Howard reaches for him.

C.U. - HOWARD'S HAND reaching for BULGAR's...They connect.

WIDE SHOT - The boys are on the train as it leaves town.

On it's route, the train passes a ramshackle GRAVEYARD.

CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY INTO THE GRAVEYARD until it reaches A

HEADSTONE, made with flecked pink stone. Upon the headstone

is only one word:

BELOVED.

EXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - CONTINUOUS.

Camera moves slowly towards the side exterior of 124, into a

Close-Up of a WOMAN looking out of a second floor bedroom

window. It is SETHE, mother of the two boys and Denver. She

hums her melody, softly, sadly, with a resigned understanding

of why her boys are running away...and a deep pain that is

too constant to notice.

FADE IN:

INT. 124 - BABY SUGGS BEDROOM - LATER THAT DAY.

BABY SUGGS, grandmother and mother-in-law to Sethe, sits in

her bed fondling colored fabric of BRIGHT GREEN..It is the

only vibrant color in an otherwise drab surrounding. Suggs is

bed-ridden, exhausted to her bones - her face a mosaic of

suffering and sacrifice and tested faith.

Sethe is placing folded laundry into a dresser. She stops and

checks her pockets for rags or swatches...She looks around

the room..

Suggs goes back to contemplating her green until;

Suggs looks up to see Sethe sticking her pink tongue out at

her. Suggs smiles.

Sethe lets out a small laugh. She walks toward the window,

stretching her body. Her expression changes as she thinks of

her boys. Baby Suggs reads her like a book.

Sethe's mixed feelings show all over her face. Although she

loved Halle, there is clearly something unresolved in her.

Sethe exits.

EXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - LATE DAY.

Denver is playing in the front yard by herself.

Sethe is pumping water into a bucket for clothes washing. A

gentle breeze carries a LEAF into the bucket. Sethe sees it

floating atop the water for a moment, then picks it up.

C.U. of SETHE as the image triggers a feeling - and the

feeling a memory - from long ago.

Sethe looks around her and finds she is no longer standing in

the barren field of 124...but rather-

MEMORY;

EXT. SWEET HOME - LATE DAY.

A stunning vista of the plantation SWEET HOME - sun beating

down on groves and rows of gorgeous sycamores for as far as

the eye can see. Sethe's figure dwarfed by the majestic

landscape.

Sethe looks frightened. Her breathing grows shallow. She

hears something;

THE SOUND OF A WAGON'S WHEELS - rolling over a road, growing

louder, coming towards her

C.U. OF A WAGON WHEEL MOVING RAPIDLY ON A ROAD. CAMERA PANS

UP TO THE MAN DRIVING THE WAGON - A STERN WHITE MAN WEARING A

DISTINCTIVE HAT...

SETHE TURNS away from the sycamores towards the road to see;

END OF MEMORY;

EXT. 124 BLUESTONE - LATE DAY.

A MAN driving a horse and wagon with two children in the

back, coming up Bluestone Road. He wears no hat.

Sethe breathes easily. She looks around her -the reality of

124's barren field has returned. The memory of Sweet Home's

sycamores have vanished.

Denver is playing near the road. As the wagon nears 124,

Denver looks up and smiles. The Man whips the horse hard so

as to ride past the house faster. The children stare at

Denver and 124, with horror and curiosity.

The stares of the children destroy Denver's smile. She

watches them go, then turns to hide her upset and sees her

mother watching her.

Sethe looks to Denver with empathy and impotence: wanting to

ease her daughter's pain and knowing full well she cannot.

Hurt and angry, Denver runs past Sethe, towards the woods.

EXT. WOODS - LATE DAY.

Denver runs with a purpose, knowing exactly where she is

going.

She reaches FIVE BOXWOOD BUSHES planted in a ring. The tall

bushes stretch toward each other four feet off the ground,

forming a round, emerald room in the center, seven feet high,

with walls fifty inches thick of murmuring leaves.

This is Denver's private place. She bends low and crawls

through the leaves into the center. Once there, this lonely

child wipes away her tears and tries to pull herself

together. She lays her face against the cool earth.

INT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - NIGHT.

Denver walks to her room in her night dress. She passes the

opened door of her mother's bedroom and peeks in:

INT. SETHE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT.

Sethe kneeling by her bed, as if praying...

Beside Sethe, A WHITE DRESS KNEELS as well, with it's sleeve

around Sethe's waist. Like two friendly grown-up women,

comforting each other in prayer.

Denver tip toes away.

INT. DENVER'S ROOM - NIGHT.

Sethe enters to check on Denver, whom she thinks is asleep.

She leans over and kisses her forehead, only to discover she

is awake;

Hearing her mother say this, moves Denver.

Sethe smiles sympathetically for her lonely child. They hear

a sound in the house - floor boards creaking.

Sethe nods and holds her daughter's hand as they listen.

SUPER: 1873.

EXT. 124 BLUESTONE ROAD - DAY.

C.U. - PAUL D. GARNER.

Paul stands on the road, gazing up at the house. Grateful

he's arrived, cautious about what he'll find, he steps

towards the porch. His clothes are ragged. His feet sore and

blistering in his shoes.

EXT. THE PUMP - DAY.

Off to the side of the house, Sethe washes her feet and legs

at the pump. She looks up and sees Paul's figure walking

towards the house. The sun blazes in her eyes. She can't make

out who it is, or whether or not he's even real. As he

reaches the porch, Paul disappears from view.

Sethe walks towards the front of the house. When she is

little more than forty feet away, she stops - still not

certain Paul is a real man or an hallucination of the past.

Sethe jams her balled up stockings into her pocket. She

smiles like a little girl, not able to believe her eyes.

He begins taking off his shoes.

Sethe doesn't know what to do with her eyes when he says

this..she looks away instinctively. Paul realizes that may

have sounded too intimate so he leans back and sighs:

Like a nervous little girl, Sethe takes a sit beside a man

for the first time in years, folding her sweat stained skirt

beneath her.

Awkward pause. Sethe tries to find the words to a difficult

question - but one that is foremost in her mind;

Paul knows instantly she is asking about Halle.

Something about Paul's expression might suggest he's keeping

something from her. He turns his gaze outward as he says;

Awkward silence.

Paul smiles a warm, touched smile that after all that they've

survived, Sethe is worried about what he'll think of her

home.

Sethe smiles, then rises to escort him in.

INT. 124 BLUESTONE ROAD - DAY.

Sethe opens the front door and enters, with Paul behind her,

hanging his shoes by the laces over his shoulder. As he

follows her in;

A POOL OF RED, UNDULATING LIGHT forms around him. It worries

him.

The light undulates faster and faster, extending all the way

to the kitchen at the end of the hall. Frightened, Paul steps

back out the door.

Sethe reaches out her hand. Paul tentatively takes it and is

lead through the red light of the hallway, through to the

kitchen where it ends.

As he walks through, we can see Paul affected by the light.

It is sad. A sadness that touches him, welling up inside

until tears are brimming in his eyes. He reaches the normal

light of the kitchen and steps out of it.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY.

Paul turns back to find the red light in the hall is gone.

Still affected by the light, Paul eases himself down at the

table, finding something to say.

She places a bottle and a glass on the table before him. The

light jarred him. He snatches the bottle to drink and calm

himself down. She jokes.

INT. SECOND FLOOR OF 124 - MORNING.

Denver, all of eighteen years old now, and beautiful, is

buttoning up her dress when she hears the voice of a man down

in the kitchen. She stops. Her face lights up.

She runs down the white staircase.

INT. KITCHEN - MORNING.

As Denver runs into the kitchen, we hear:

Denver appears expectantly, down the white staircase that

leads from the second floor. She looks at Paul wide eyed.

They turn to her with gentle smiles;

Denver's heart sinks.

But Denver reacts with surprise and dismay. Paul is not her

friend. Paul, right now, is more of an intruder.

Sethe pauses - unnerved and irritated by Denver's challenge.

He addresses his humor to Denver who offers no response. She

crosses to the stove and works on lighting it. She's mad.

Denver collapses where she stands, sobbing out loud. Sethe

moves to her.

Denver moves away. Sethe registers this rejection.

Denver allows herself to be held.

Sethe's sudden outburst startles Paul. He watches as Sethe

ushers Denver out to the keeping room off the kitchen to

quiet her down.

Alone, Paul is disturbed by Sethe's words. He fishes out a

pouch of tobacco and concentrates on it, searching for

smoking papers he knows he doesn't have...waiting for Sethe

to return.

When she does, she heads straight for the stove. She spits on

her finger and touches it to check it's heat. She then begins

to make bread from flour, soda and salt - keeping her back to

Paul throughout - as the scene continues;

Sethe pauses. Something in her decides to tell Paul D,

although she keeps working on the bread to stay in control;

Paul listens, half dreading where he thinks this story's going.

Sethe works faster. It is the work, taking an action - any

action - that allows her tell the story numbly, without the

pain of reliving it...without the images attacking

....yet, the images come anyway.

INTERCUT: FLASHES OF MEMORY attack as SETHE TELLS HER

STORY...

INT. BARN - A NIGHT REMEMBERED.

- Sethe being raped, beaten, held down by SCHOOLTEACHER'S

BOYS in a barn with a loft...

Sethe screams and is smacked across the face.

One of the boys holds her face and mouth and head as the two

others hold down her body and ravage her....

Her mouth covered, her head immobile - she stares up at the

loft.

END OF MEMORY IMAGES.

INT. KITCHEN - PRESENT DAY.

Sethe squeezes her eyes to erase the image and works harder

on the biscuit dough...The flashes of IMAGES STOP...

Sethe has separated the dough into biscuits which she slips

into the stove. As she rises, Paul steps gently behind her.

He slowly caresses her breasts from behind, pressing his

cheek against her back.. He rubs his cheek against it,

feeling the scars beneath the dress. Raising his fingers to

the hooks, as Sethe cries silently, he undoes her dress which

slips down to her hips, exposing the sculpture her back has

become.

Grateful to have her body be someone else's responsibility

for the moment, Sethe closes her eyes as Paul touches every

ridge and leaf of her tree with his mouth. The tenderness is

almost unbearable.

Suddenly, PAUL'S LEGS BEGIN TREMBLING. He pauses and looks

down...He realizes it is not his legs that tremble, but

rather;

THE FLOORBOARDS THEMSELVES ARE PITCHING, GRINDING, SHOVING

the house from side to side.

Sethe slides to the floor, struggling with her dress.

On all fours, Denver crawls in from the keeping room as if

trying to keep the house together.

Paul, falling, reaching for an anchor, begins to shout;

A table rushes at him but Paul grabs it's leg. Managing to

stand at an angle as the house continues to pitch, he holds

the table by two legs and bashes it about, wrecking

everything, screaming at the house;

The quaking slows to an occasional lurch but Paul does not

stop whipping the table around until everything it is

absolutely still. He leans against the wall, panting.

Sethe is crouched by the stove. A mixed expression of relief

and guilt - the expression of a mother whose disobedient

child has been sent away. But a child she loves nonetheless.

Denver looks frightened. More alone than ever, now that her

one companion is gone.

All three are breathing together as if to the same beat, like

one tired person.

INT. KITCHEN - LATER THAT DAY..

Denver walks through the broken furniture and dishes. At the

stove, she ashes over the fire and pulls the pan of biscuits

from the oven,

EXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - CONTINUOUS.

A shirtless Paul D. is by the water pump washing himself.

INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS.

Denver lifts the fallen jelly cupboard, it's contents laying

in a heap in the corner of the bottom shelf. She takes out a

jar. She looks for a plate and finds half of one by the

broken table. She picks it up as she hears Paul enter through

the front door.

INT. BABY SUGGS BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS.

Sethe prepares a bed for Paul. Baby Suggs quilt is on the

bed. She hesitates whether or not to leave it there.

Paul stands by the door with his shoes in his bands, his

shirt hanging open down the front.

Sethe is surprised to see him there - she feels awkward.

They stand in silence, looking at each other for a moment.

The awkwardness they both feel strike them suddenly as funny.

Paul starts smiling. Sethe covers her mouth to conceal it.

And then, just as quickly, the urge to laugh subsides - and

the fear they feel takes it's place.

Paul slowly closes the door and places his shoes on the

floor. Sethe watches him. Paul crosses to her. He moves in to

kiss her. They approach each other's lips like two burn

victims, trying desperately not to hurt the other with their

touch.

EXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - CONTINUOUS.

Denver sits on the porch steps, alone once again. Miserably

eating the biscuit and jelly off of a half broken plate.

INT. BABY SUGGS BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER.

Sethe and Paul lay in bed, after lovemaking. They are still

fully clothed. The lovemaking was fast and finished quickly.

Now, there is an awkwardness that is without humor or

excitement - but sits like a chasm between them.

As Sethe lays there, SHE REMEMBERS:

MEMORY:

EXT. THE CORN FIELDS OF SWEET HOME - A DAY REMEMBERED.

A brilliant bright yellow and green corn stalks in a tiny

corn field.

Sethe and a slightly older HALLE - handsome, strong - run

through the field until Halle stops them at an isolated spot.

Sethe looks and can see nothing through the corn stalks. She

shakes her head no.

He takes off his shirt. Seethe giggles as she gets on the

ground, keeping her ankles crossed.

Halle lays her back and gently separates her legs. She

giggles. Halle pauses before laying on top of her.

He sings the word "life", so that Sethe laughs. Then, Halle

lowers himself slowly to her and they begin to make love. As

camera pans up to a HILL above the field, we hear Sethe ask;

We hear Halle grunt "uh-huh" as we arrive on the hill where a

GREAT TREE sits.

EXT. GREAT TREE ON THE HILL - DAY.

Beneath the tree, PAUL D, SIXO and Paul's brothers Paul A.

and Paul P. are pouring water over heads and watching;

POV; Unbeknownst to Halle and Sethe, their lovemaking is in

clear view to anyone on the hill...

The men watch the corn stalks swaying to the lovemaking.

A YOUNG PAUL D., in particular, watches with tender yearning.

INT. KITCHEN AT SWEET HOME - EARLY EVENING.

MR. GARNER, the man who owns and runs Sweet Home. He offers

cooked corn to the men.

The men looks to each other, suppressing a laugh.

Everyone looks at each other as they thank No. Garner and

begin to smear butter on their corn and eat.

A NEIGHBORING FARMER visiting the Garner's cautions him;

Sethe hides a smile as she hands a piece of corn to Halle.

Paul A and Paul F hesitate as they think of eating the corn

which the lovers consummated. But Sixo digs right in.

Paul D eats slowly, his eyes never leaving Sethe as she moves

Around the kitchen, her eyes never leaving Halle...Paul's

Attraction and love for her are apparent.

END OF MEMORY;

INT. SETHE'S BEDROOM - EARLY EVENING.

C.U. on PAUL, on his back, turned away from Sethe.

What began as Sethe's memory, has blended into Paul's.

Sethe rises off the bed, breaking the thick silence between them:

She exits, leaving Paul alone on the bed.

EXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - THE FOLLOWING DAY.

We see the house now. No creaking or sounds of breaking

furniture. Just the sound of Paul D. singing.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY.

Paul is singing as he fixes the table he broke while driving

the baby ghost away.

Denver is sweeping the floor - irritated by Paul's presence

and voice.

They both hear the front door open as Sethe arrives home from

work.

They look to each other to see which one will make a move for

Sethe first. Paul knows enough to bide his time with Denver.

He watches as she places the broom down and exits the

kitchen.

EXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - NIGHT.

Paul and Sethe sit on the porch together. Sethe is sewing.

Paul nervously gets up his nerve to ask:

Paul moves to where Sethe is sitting.

Sethe realizes what he is asking and tentatively responds:

Beat. Sethe is frightened by the prospect of feeling for him.

Sethe rises to enter the house when Paul's words stop her:

Sethe's heart is twisted. She wants to cry...because she

feels hope...and because she feels fear.

Sethe manages a smile.

INT. DENVER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT.

Denver lies curled up in her bed. Alone.

Sethe enters and crawls in unexpectedly. Denver looks up,

surprised to see her.

Denver obeys, unsure.

Sethe lets out a small laugh.

They hear Paul singing out on the porch. Denver grimaces.

Denver's eyes light up with excitement then caution.

Sethe can barely bring herself to say. To hope. To imagine.

Paul? But, for Denver, she forces herself and whispers;

EXT. CARNIVAL - DAY.

Paul and Sethe and Denver walk among the hundreds of black

townspeople gathered for the carnival.

A sign reads COLORED THURSDAY...TWO PENNIES ENTRANCE FEE.

Paul is in high spirits. Saying hello to anyone whose eye he

catches. Willing, eager to get anything for Denver she wants.

Feeling a little more like a normal van in a normal life.

Denver is excited but worried. She doesn't want to like Paul

but can't help the thrill she's feeling. And when one or two

passersby shout out;

Denver heart almost weeps with joy.

Sethe walks cautiously. Overdressed for the occasion, it is

her first outing among neighborhood folk in many years.

She catches the eyes of some of the women she knows...ELLA

and LADY JONES..good Christian women who nod in their

acknowledgement yet are holding back something. A judgement?

A repulsion?

Paul doesn't notice them and for this Sethe is glad.

MONTAGE of SCENES...the various carnival acts, all performed

by a WHITE TROUPE; magic, clowning, fire swallowing, spitting

ribbons, acrobats forming pyramids...

Our trio take it all in like water to the thirsty.

At one point, A WHITE CARNIVAL BARKER shouts to the children;

The phrase stabs Sethe and Paul a bit. But Paul whispers;

Sethe can't help but let out a small laugh - and with that

laugh, a sudden sensation of relief...

Paul buys Denver some licorice, peppermint and lemonade.

Holding the lemonade for her, Paul asks;

Denver agrees. Paul takes some lemonade then wipes the rim

where he sipped with a small napkin and gently hands it back

to her. Denver, in spite of herself, is starting to like him.

END MONTAGE.

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY.

Our trio are leaving the carnival, walking three astride with

distance in between each. The sunlight casts strong shadows.

Sethe's eyes glance towards the ground behind them and sees;

THEIR THREE SHADOWS ARE HOLDING HANDS.....as they walk home.

FADE- IN.

EXT. A STREAM AND THE BANK BESIDE IT - DAY.

WIDE ANGLE of a BEAUTIFUL, WIDE STREAM (more like a small

river) with a MULBERRY TREE standing tall on the bank before

it. There is not a soul in sight as the stream moves

gracefully beneath the sun.

SUDDENLY;

A FULLY DRESSED YOUNG BLACK WOMAN EMERGES FROM THE MIDDLE OF

THE STREAM LIKE A GODDESS ARISING OUT OF SPIRITUAL WATERS...

SHE WEARS A STRAW HATT A WHITE DRESS WITH BUTTONS, A LACE

COLLAR AND NEW SHOES. SHE WALKS OUT OF THE WATER TO THE BANK.

Exhausted, sopping wet and breathing heavily as if from

asthma, she sits, leaning against the mulberry tree. She

seems too tired to even hold her head upon her neck. Yet her

skin is like new lineless and smooth. Glowing.

Although racked with pain, SHE IS SMILING. Smiling the way

travellers smile when they have finally arrived after a long

and arduous journey.

EXT. WOODS - DAY.

The Young Black Woman makes her way through the woods. She

passes by Denver's BOXWOOD BUSH secret place. Then continues

forward, as if with a specific direction in mind.

EXT. 124 BLUESTONE ROAD - LATE AFTERNOON.

Sethe, Paul and Denver approach 124. Denver is the first to

see.

All three look to see;

THE YOUNG BLACK WOMAN sitting on a stump not far from the

steps of 124.

As the three approach, the Young Woman lifts her head and

stares directly at Sethe.

The two women exchange a moment in their eyes - Sethe,

curious yet warm...The Young Woman, happy yet there is a

hunger in her stare.

INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER.

The Young Woman seated on a chair as Denver refills a tin cup

of water. The Young Woman drinks greedily, cup after cup.

The Young Woman shakes her head NO. She reaches down and

takes off her shoes, which Sethe notices as new. Sethe bends

down to pick them up. The Young Woman never lets her eyes

leave Sethe.

The Young Woman speaks in a low, rough voice;

Sethe drops the shoes. Denver sits down. Paul smiles;

As she spells it we see sethe's reaction; she is deeply

touched. Then Denver's - who looks both amazed and curiously

excited.

Sethe hangs her own hat on a peg then approaches Beloved.

But Beloved has fallen asleep upright in the chair.

Her eyes open to slits. Paul is about to help her when Denver

rises;

Denver eases Beloved onto her feet, which Sethe and Paul

notice do not have a line or sore on them.

Yet, Beloved can barely stand upon them as Denver escorts her

to the white staircase. Beloved starts coughing.

Denver helps her up the stairs. Sethe and Paul register

Denver's defensive reaction.

INT. BABY SUGG'S ROOM - SAME TIME.

Denver eases Beloved into the bed. Beloved falls asleep the

second she hits the pillow. Denver gently - cautiously -

strokes Beloved's forehead and cheek.

INT. BABY SUGG'S ROOM - NIGHT.

Denver stands vigil beside Beloved, wrapped beneath a quilt.

INT. BABY SUGG'S ROOM - THE FOLLOWING DAY.

Denver watches her sleep, wiping her hot forehead with cold

cloths...

INT. BABY'S SUGG'S ROOM - NIGHT.

Denver washes out Beloved's underwear and stockings...She

hears Beloved murmuring. She moves quickly to her side.

Beloved shakes her head no. She takes hold of Denver's arm

and wraps it around her own body. Denver sits up against the

pillow as Beloved snuggles her body into Denver's arms and

falls back asleep. Denver holds her, lovingly.

INT. BABY SUGGS ROOM - DAYS LATER.

Denver has not left her bedside. She places another quilt

upon her, tucking it in around the sides. As she does this,

Beloved's eyes open for a brief moment, catching the sight of

Denver over her. She smiles. Denver gratefully smiles back.

Beloved looks over to a plate of half finished food -

Denver's meal. Denver picks up a piece of sweet bread and

feeds her. Denver is thrilled.

THE FOLLOWING SCENES TAKE PLACE OVER SEVERAL WEEKS;

INT. KITCHEN - THE NEXT DAY.

Denver places sugar between two pieces of bread and gives the

sandwich to Beloved, who, no longer feeling sickly, accepts

it with a bright smile.

EXT. HEN HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY.

Denver explains how to pack mud in the cracks of the hen

house as Beloved listens attentively, eating jelly out of a

jar.

INT. HEN HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY.

Denver explains to Beloved how to warm the chicks with their

skirts as the latter eats something sweet. They both giggle

at the softness of the chicks.

INT. DENVER & BELOVED'S BEDROOM - ANOTHER DAY.

Denver is showing Beloved how to make her bed.

As Denver continues, Beloved steps towards her and begins to

touch her face - examining her lips, her nose, her skin as if

it were a rose to admire. Denver drinks in the attention, her

heart expanding with love with every touch from this strange

creature.

EXT. PORCH - EARLY EVENING.

Everyone is sitting on the porch after dinner.

Beloved, looking strong and fit, eats a cane stick - gnawing

at it to the flax, keeping the strings in her mouth long

after the syrup had been sucked off. It makes Denver laugh,

as she licks her cane stick. It makes Sethe smile, to see

them both happy.

It makes Paul disgusted.

INT. KEEPING ROOM - NIGHT.

Paul confronts Sethe as she sews.

At that moment, Denver passes by on her way to the kitchen.

Denver enters the keeping room.

Denver looks at Paul with a hard gaze;

From Paul's expression we can tell Denver is lying...and

whatever fragile connection they were building, is swiftly

destroyed.

INT. SETHE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT.

Sethe is getting ready for bed. Denver sticks her head in:

Sethe shakes her head. Denver exits anxiously. The mentions

of Beloved's name stir a MEMORY in Sethe:

MEMORY:

EXT. GRAVESTONE YARD - A DAY REMEMBERED.

Sethe talks to the HEADSTONE ENGRAVER as he works in the hot

sun. His YOUNG SON helps him.

The Engraver eyes her body.

Sethe is embarrassed by his lascivious tone, especially in

front of the young boy.

The Engraver rises, takes a step toward Sethe and touches her

hip, curling his hand around to her back.

His hand glides down to her buttocks. Sethe can't help but

see the Young Boy watching the scene.

END of MEMORY.

INT. SETHE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT.

As the memory starts to fade form her mind, Sethe suddenly

feels someone else's presence. She looks up to find:

Beloved standing by the door - watching her.

Beloved kneels before her on the floor and finishes buttoning

up Sethe's night dress.

Beloved nods, absorbing the information.

Sethe, nods, understanding such things. She cautiously

reaches out to stroke Beloved's face. Beloved responds like a

puppy, pressing her cheek against Sethe's hand. Sethe is

moved.

INT. KITCHEN - PRE DAWN.

Sethe enters the kitchen to make bread before she leaves for

work. She finds Beloved waiting for her, placing out her

cooking things on the table. Beloved looks up and smiles.

EXT. 124 BLUESTONE - EARLY EVENING.

Beloved waits anxiously at the window for the sight of Sethe

coming home from work....

When she sees her, she runs through the house, out the door

to meet her.

Denver appears at the door, upset by Beloved's loss of

attention in her.

EXT. PORCH - EVENING.

C.U. - SETHE, as she leans her tired head against the porch,

sitting on the step. She closes her eyes and is about to

drift off, when;

BELOVED'S HAND gently touches her shoulder, settling there.

Sethe looks up and smiles, patting her hand. Beloved stands

above her as Denver takes a seat on the step.

Beloved searches Sethe's eyes and asks;

The question surprises Sethe...and startles Denver.

Sethe hesitates. Beloved kneels at her feet.

Denver awaits her mother's reaction with great interest.

Sethe looks at Beloved sweet, innocent expression and

something in her resistance, eases:

Denver is both interested and slightly hurt at her mother's

willingness to tell Beloved what she'd never tell her:

Sethe's continues telling Beloved, an attentive audience...

Denver, more attuned to Beloved's interest than the story, is

disturbed at her mother's telling of it.

INT. KITCHEN - ANOTHER EVENING.

Camera moves up from the mended legs of the table Paul broke

to;

A suspicious Paul glares at Beloved as they eat dinner.

Beloved is ever ready to pass Sethe a bowl or napkin or

whatever she needs. She is "shining" - for Sethe, and for

Sethe alone.

Denver notices it as well.

It is raining outside. Both Denver and Beloved are wet from

the rain. Denver's hair is all tangled.

All three look to Beloved, puzzled by her question, which is

clearly intended for Sethe. Paul's getting more annoyed.

Beloved nods. Paul and Denver exchange a curious look.

Paul and Denver look to Sethe, waiting to see if she'll answer.

Paul is disturbed by Sethe's carefree storytelling - how it

contradicts her words to him that first day and worried it

will lead to no good...

Once again, Denver is surprised to hear what she's never

heard before. She looks to Paul and knows what he is

thinking. Paul looks back and knows Denver realizes it. But

Denver returns his glance with a defensive dismissal of the

eyes.

Paul doesn't want her to continue but doesn't want to say so.

Sethe rises to get him more food and she continues:

Paul is disturbed. He can see Sethe getting upset. He is mad

at Beloved for her damn questions..

Something inside of Sethe stops, a wall erected. Something

unwanted is coming into her consciousness. Paul notices it.

She rises;

Sethe collects a few dishes and crosses to the sink as Paul asks:

Camera follows Sethe as she arrives at the sink, placing the

dish inside. We hear the others O.S.:

Camera stays on Sethe as we drown out the voices at the

kitchen table. She is staring out the window above the sink

as if watching the MEMORY BEING RELIVED IN HER YARD;

POV - OUT THE WINDOW;

MEMORY:

EXT. A LARGE TREE IN A FIELD - A DAY REMEMBERED.

A CROWD of people surround a tree. SEVERAL WHITE MEN are

preparing to hang a group of black men and women standing in

line, awaiting their turn.

Among the crowd is A CHILD (SETHE) holding the hand of an

OLDER BLACK SLAVE WOMAN (NAN). Nan is pointing to a WOMAN

(SETHE'S MOTHER), who is one of the people waiting in line to

be hanged. Nan whispers to Sethe:

Little Sethe looks up and sees her mother - her face a mask

of courage and rage and tears. She looks straight ahead - not

at anyone in particular, especially not her daughter.

The child Sethe listens, watching her mother move further

down the line.

END of MEMORY as WE CUT BACK TO:

INT. KITCHEN -

Sethe, the memory passing, hears the voices in her kitchen:

She finds Paul interrogating Beloved who eats a second

pudding. Denver tries to interfere.

At the sink, both Sethe and Denver pause, obviously interested.

Paul looks quizzically at Sethe, who shrugs;

Suddenly, she begins to CHOKE on a raisin from the pudding

and falls backward, off the chair.

Denver and Sethe rush towards her. Beloved thrashes around

until they help her turn over and spit up the raisin.

She breathes in Sethe's arms as Denver wipes up the mess,

glaring at Paul.

Sethe gets Beloved to her feet. Denver takes her up the

staircase to her room - glaring at Paul.

When the girls have gone, Sethe turns on Paul as she cleans

up.

Forgetting himself, Paul let that slip out.

Sethe stops dead cold. It's no use...

The MEMORY TAKES OVER:

INT. BARN - THE PAST.

Violent, rapid images of Sethe being raped and beaten held

down by SCHOOLTEACHER'S BOYS. Sethe, pinned down, stares up

at the loft...Camera rises up...

There, in the loft, hides HALLE...The expression on his face

is that of a man broken in two...

END of MEMORY.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT.

Sethe wraps her arms tightly around herself and asks;

C.U. on PAUL who doesn't want to explain - or even remember -

as we cut to:

MEMORY:

EXT. SWEET HOME - DAY.

PAUL HAS A BIT IN HIS MOUTH CHAINED TO A WAGON.

He is being lead away from Sweet Home with other black men,

by Three white Men. The bit jerks his head back, saliva

spills uncontrollably out of his mouth. His hands are chained

behind him. His feet chained together at the

ankles....Another chain is connected to an iron belt and

stretches to a wagon. He is being lead away with forty five

other prisoners...

He is lead past the milk shed, when he sees:

HALLE, alone with a crazed faraway look in his eyes, sitting

by the butter churn. HALLE'S FACE IS COVERED WITH BUTTER AND

CLABBER. He sticks his hands in the churn and continues to

cover his face with the sticky, slippery, white substance

covering his face and head, squeezing it through his hands.

The White Men laugh. Paul is aching to scream out to him but

the iron bit holds down his tongue.

As Paul is lead past Halle, A ROOSTER named MISTER is SITTING

ON A TUB in the sun shrieks with an almost arrogant glee.

Mister crows and the white men laugh.

Tears of rage and humiliation stream down Paul's face. He

struggles to keep a view of Halle, until he is out of sight.

END OF MEMORY.

EXT. PORCH. - EARLY EVENING.

Paul approaches Sethe, touching her gently.

Sethe, instead of collapsing from the information, she seems

hardened.

Sethe exits O.S. Paul is left alone on the porch until

Beloved runs out of the house giggling with Denver in

pursuit. As Denver passes, Paul sarcastically remarks;

Denver gives him a quick, disdainful look, then continues

after Beloved.

The two girls run towards the woods.

EXT. BOXWOOD BUSH ROOM - NIGHT.

Beloved is dancing beneath a bright moon. Denver is an

attentive, grateful audience.

She puts her fists on her hips and skips.

She takes Denver's hand and places another on her shoulder.

As they dance, Denver laughs harder and harder - a giddiness

from the dizziness and the gratitude she feels for Beloved's

attention.

They spin and fall to the ground, like two lovers nestled.

Beloved catches her breath as Denver asks;

And with that, Denver takes a breath of courage to ask the

question she's been longing to ask:

Beloved looks at her and smiles. They are so close she leans

in curiously and - touching Denver's face - kisses her on the

lips.

Smiling, Beloved moves to touch Denver's cheek when suddenly,

Denver sits up cross legged and urges Beloved;

Suddenly, Beloved's face turns to rage as she rises up as

well;

Beloved abruptly drops to her knees and crawls out the

boxwood bush room as Denver's pleads;

INT. DENVER'S & BELOVED'S ROOM - DAWN THE FOLLOWING DAY.

The room is still dark from the night but the sun is rising

outside.

Suddenly, Beloved awakens with a start. She senses something.

She rises and looks out the window to see;

POV;

SETHE WALKING ACROSS THE FIELD.

Beloved quickly grabs her clothes and exits to follow her, as

Denver awakens just in time to see her go.

EXT. WOODS EARLY MORNING.

Sethe is dressed as if for church as she makes her way through

the woods with a specific destination in mind.

Soon, she comes upon;

EXT. A CLEARING IN THE WOODS - EARLY MORNING.

Sethe steps out of the woods and into an open clearing. A

LARGE ROCK sits in the clearing like a pulpit above the pew's

of grass and weeds.

Sethe remembers the place as it was... She hears the VOICES

OF A CROWD...a gathering of people though the clearing

remains empty. She crosses to the rock and sits. Camera moves

up to reveal -

MEMORY:

BABY SUGGS, vital and strong, standing on the rock,

preaching:

END OF MEMORY.

C.U. on SETHE as she remembers Baby Suggs words, sitting

alone in the clearing - the images of the past gone.

EXT. WOODS - SAME TIME.

Beloved has found her and watches from a hidden place...

Camera moves beyond her to find;

Denver, having followed Beloved, watches her from a distance.

EXT. A CLEARING IN THE WOODS - EARLY MORNING.

Sethe remembers Baby Suggs advice:

Sethe weeps...She slides to the ground and holds her head to

weep. She covers her head from God and cries AS SHE LETS THE

MEMORIES COME..memories she can no longer fight from coming;

SETHE'S MEMORIES;

EXT. SWEET HOME - A NIGHT REMEMBERED.

SETHE IS IN THE SAME BENT OVER POSITION only here, her back

is exposed and she is being beaten by the Schoolteacher's

boys. The BOY BEATING SETHE never stops with the whip for a

second as he rants;

They beat her mercilessly.

EXT. FIELD - NIGHT.

Sethe, tear stained, bloody and very pregnant fights her way

through a corn field as she makes her escape..

Her dress hangs torn at the back - her wounds open and

bleeding. Her feet already swollen and blistered. She is in

agonizing pain. She moves like a figure in a nightmare.

A SERIES OF IMAGES IN WHICH WE SEE SETHE STRUGGLING THROUGH

DAYS AND NIGHTS OF WALKING AND HIDING, IN VARIOUS LOCATIONS

AS SHE MAKES HER WAY ACROSS THE STATE.

THE FINAL IMAGE IS:

EXT. ONION FIELD - DAY.

Sethe falls to the ground unable to move - her contractions

have started and the pain is unbearable.

Her breasts are leaking on her sweat stained body. Her legs

are scratched and bleeding from moving through broken twigs

and rock. On her back, the tree is starting to form.

She lays there waiting for death. Until a VOICE ASKS:

Sethe can not answer as she hears TWO FEET moving through the

field. She clutches her pregnant stomach as if somehow she

might hide it from whoever might be coming to harm her.

A RAGGEDLY LOOKING WHITE GIRL with arms like cane stalks and

enough hair for five heads steps through into view.

Sethe can not speak for fear.

Sethe manages to control her breath and push out the word;

Amy looks at Sethe's swollen, bloody flesh at the end of her

legs.

Amy doesn't know what to do with that information. So..

Any stands and looks as if she's about to leave when Sethe,

feeling the girl is safe, stops her with a question.

Sethe desperately wants her to stay - to not be alone. Amy

kneels back down to her, curious now;

Amy wipes her nose and looks up beyond Sethe.

Amy helps Sethe turn over onto all fours.

EXT. ONION FIELD - DAY...MINUTES LATER.

Amy walks beside Sethe as the latter painfully crawls, taking

moments to stop and let the pain go through her.

INT. LEAN-TO - EARLY EVENING.

Amy makes a pile of leaves for Sethe to lay on and some rocks

for her to put up her feet. She talks non-stop as she works.

She eases Sethe onto the leaves then lifts her feet onto the

rocks.

Amy props Sethe up from behind when she notices

Sethe makes a tremendous effort just to turn to her side as

Amy undoes her dress;

Amy sees Sethe's back and, for a moment, is speechless. Then:

INT. LEAN-TO - NIGHT.

To Sethe's amazement, Amy begins to massage her feet and legs

the pain of which causes Sethe to cry.

Amy continues singing.....

EXT. PATH LEADING TO RIVER - DAY.

Sethe is trying to walk, holding on to Amy at first, then a

tree.

Amy doesn't know what to say, so she says:

Sethe keeps trying to walk;

Amy cutting two pieces form Sethe shawl then filling them

with leaves and tying them over her feet -

EXT. RIVERBANK - DAY.

Sethe and Amy walk towards the river when then see:

A SMALL, ABANDONED ROWBOAT with oars.

Sethe can't believe her eyes. She walks right into the water

when suddenly, her own water breaks and her labor begins...

She doubles up in pain;

Sethe, on her knees, crawls into the boat and props her feet

up. Water leaks in wherever it can, rising up as high as her

waist. Amy takes her position to assist.

Sethe screams in agony as the child pushes through. Amy curses;

Amy's strong hands pull Denver's head out and up, to meet

Sethe's eyes. Sethe cannot believe this creature made it

through..Amy rinses it with water then, wrapping it in her

skirt, holds it up to Sethe..

EXT. BANKS OF THE OHIO RIVER - DAY.

Sethe awakens, mud-caked, on the banks of the river. Her baby

girl crying beside her. Amy is gone. She rises, painfully,

picks up her child and continues on her way.

MONTAGE - MORE DAYS AND NIGHTS OF SETHE, NOW WITHOUT AMY - A

NEW BABY STRAPPED TO HER BODY - MAKING HER AWAY ALONG THE

OHIO RIVER...THROUGH HOT SUNNY DAYS AND RAINY NIGHTS WITHOUT

PROTECTION...SEARCHING FOR FOOD AND SHELTER...

FINAL IMAGE IS:

EXT. RIVER BANK - OAK TREE - NIGHT.

A thunderstorm cracks across the sky and floods the river.

Sethe is sitting beneath the oak - the rain soaking her as

she breast feeds her baby. She cries out loud - but her sobs

and tears are lost in the rain and thunder.

EXT. RIVERBANK - LATER THAT DAY.

Sethe walks downriver with Denver tied to her chest. She

stops when she sees:

A FLATBED gliding down river. She can't make out if they're

white people or not, so she hides behind a tree until it

passes;

Waiting behind the tree, we see that Sethe is sweating a

fever. But Denver seems to be doing fine.

She sees the flatbed pass her and continues on her way. She

sees;

THREE COLORED PEOPLE - AN OLDER MAN and two boys - fishing.

She approaches cautiously.

One of the boys is the first to see her. Sethe's bloody and

torn clothes and her feverish face make her quite a sight to

the young boy. He taps the Old Man on the shoulder and

motions for him to turn around.

The Old Man takes in Sethe and instantly knows where she's

been and why she's there.

Stamp Paid raises his hand to stop her. He looks around to

see that no one else is in sight, then motions for her to sit

on a rock. As she does, he gets a water jug and hands it to

her - she drinks like a madman in the desert. The Boys watch

in fascination. Stamp Paid turns to one of them and says:

The Boy slips out of his jacket, complaining.

He unties the baby from Sethe and wraps it in the coat.

EXT. RIVER - DAY.

On a flatbed, Stamp Paid crosses the river with Sethe, her

baby and the two boys.

EXT. OPPOSITE RIVER BANK - DAY.

Stamp Paid helps Sethe walk up a very steep bank while the

Boy without a jacket, carries the baby who wears it.

INT. BRUSH-COVERED HUTCH - DAY.

Stamp Paid leads Sethe and the others into the hutch.

She nods as he and the boys exit.

LATER - SAME LOCATION:

Sethe is asleep with the baby when ELLA enters the hutch;

Ella empties a sack with a wool blanket, cotton cloth, two

baked sweet potatoes and a pair of men's shoes.

EXT. 124 BLUESTONE ROAD - NIGHT.

Baby Suggs rises off the bench on the porch when she sees

Sethe coming up the walk. She runs to her and embraces Sethe

and the baby, tears in her eyes.

Baby Suggs welcomes Sethe into the house, kissing her hard on

the lips....Sethe can't believe she's in her arms.

Sethe looks at her with confusion and exhaustion.

A flash of fear is quickly transformed into pragmatism.

INT. KEEPING ROOM - NIGHT.

Baby Suggs bathes Sethe - first her face, her body...hands,

arms, legs...

When she gets to her unrecognizable feet, she touches them.

Baby Suggs notices roses of blood on Sethe's back...She looks

and covers her mouth when she sees the remnants of the whipping.

INT. KEEPING ROOM - LATER THAT DAY.

Baby Suggs with two other grown women attend to Sethe's back -

greasing it and pinning double thicknesses of cloth to the

inside of a newly stitched dress...

INT. KEEPING ROOM - STILL LATER THAT DAY.

Sethe, sitting in bed with her new dress and her wounds

dressed waits for her children.

Baby Suggs opens the door and the boys are ushered in. Sethe

welcomes them to her arms...They run to her, jumping on the

bed. The startle causes some pain but Sethe doesn't care.

The Little Girl (Beloved) is crawling and ushered toward her

mama.

Sethe picks her up and the tears flow. She can't stop kissing

them - their necks, their heads, their hands...The Boys

inspect her strange looking feet and ask;

Baby Suggs seems doubtful but appreciates the lie for the

children.

Sethe hugs and kisses them as if for the last time - as if

she still doesn't believe she can just get out of bed, walk

downstairs and be with them. The Boys leave as Sethe cradles

the Little Girl.

Sethe anxiously undoes her dress and carefully guides her

breast to the Little Girl. She winces with pain and smiles -

she got her milk to her baby girl.

Baby Suggs gathers the rags Sethe wore when she first arrived.

Baby Suggs finds TWO CRYSTAL EARRINGS.

As Sethe takes the earrings, the Little Baby Girl reaches for

them.

Through her eyes, we see them sparkle and shine - like

diamonds.

Baby Suggs hands gently massage Sethe's neck as she says;

Sethe surrenders herself to Baby Suggs firm, safe hands -

letting go of the "diamonds", one of which lands in the hands

of the Little Girl...who plays with them in fascination...

END OF MEMORY.

PRESENT DAY;

EXT. A CLEARING IN THE WOODS - DAY

Sethe is remembering these last images, she eases her own

hand up to her neck - rubbing herself the way Baby Suggs did.

She realizes how much she misses her...and wonder who can

touch her now and help her "lay it all down". And then, quite

suddenly;

AN IMAGE FLASHES ACROSS HER MIND;

- PAUL GENTLY EASING HIS HANDS AROUND SETHE FROM

BEHIND...TENDERLY KISSING SETHE'S BACK

Paul...There is Paul. Sethe realizes, as IMAGES FLASH ACROSS

HER MIND'S EYE:

- PAUL SITTING ON THE PORCH THE FIRST DAY HE ARRIVED.

- PAUL BATTLING THE BABY GHOST.

- PAUL SINGING AS HE FIXES THE KITCHEN TABLE.

- SETHE WRAPPED IN PAUL'S BIG ARMS AS THEY LAY IN BED.

Sethe rises from the ground, as if with a new realization.

She begins to walk out of the clearing and into the woods,

her pace increasing with each image....

EXT. WOODS - DAY.

Sethe walks through the woods, passing Beloved unawares - who

has fallen asleep by a tree. Beloved is awakened as Sethe

walks by, and gets to her feet to follow.

Further on, Sethe passes a sleeping Denver, who also awakens

upon hearing the footsteps of her mother, followed by

Beloved. Sethe walks on, unaware of them following her.

EXT. FIELD OF 124 BLUESTONE - DAY.

Wide angle of Sethe walking well ahead of Beloved and Denver.

Sethe is walking with great purpose and energy.

INT. 124 BLUESTONE ROAD - DAY.

Sethe enters and runs through the house to the kitchen;

Paul sits in a tub under the white staircase. He smiles.

Sethe is relieved...grateful to find him there, for her.

Sethe smiles, almost in tears.

Paul D. stands up in the tub and holds Sethe against his wet,

naked body.

He kisses her - and that's exactly what she wanted.

Camera slowly moves out of the kitchen as Sethe and Paul

begin to make love, revealing;

Beloved watching from the doorway, unknown to Sethe or Paul.

She is disgusted, envious...and runs out..

EXT. 124 BLUESTONE ROAD - DAY.

Beloved runs out of the house and heads back for the woods.

She passes Denver as if she weren't there.

EXT. STREAM IN THE WOODS - DAY.

Beloved reaches the stream and steps in. She begins to

violently hit the water around her, then begins hitting her

own face and head, clawing at it as if to escape from the

boundaries of flesh. Suddenly she submerges herself

underwater and holds herself there, as if to drown herself...

She bursts out of the water, gasping for air...Slowly, her

rage subsides, replaced with a calm, ruthless understanding

EXT. THE FIELD OF 124 BLUESTONE RD.- DAY.

Beloved is walking back toward the house. She stops.

She looks back at the house to the kitchen window - knowing

Paul and Sethe are in there. She approaches the kitchen

window and looks in.

POV - Sethe is drying off Paul's body and rebuttoning her

dress.

Camera moves slowly into a C.U. of Beloved, this time her

focus is on Paul.

INT. 124 BLUESTONE ROAD - EVENING.

The inhabitants eat dinner in silence.

Denver awaits a look from Beloved. As Beloved passes her a

bowl of peas with a smile, Denver is satisfied.

Beloved then turns to Paul, offering him the bowl.

Caught off guard, Paul looks to Sethe - whose expression asks

him to be nice.

Beat.

Paul is about to get mad when he looks to Sethe again, reels

it back in and answers curtly, but politely;

Hearing his own words echoed back to him, annoys him.

Pause. Paul focuses on his dinner, suddenly ill at ease. He

can't help looking, covertly, at Beloved and finds Beloved

staring right back at him...It makes him shiver.

INT. SETHE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT.

Sethe is asleep.

Paul is restless - tossing and turning as we Intercut;

Dream Images flashing across his mind...

- RAIN POURING DOWN A TRENCH. A MUDDY POOL FORMING AROUND A

BLACK MAN'S FEET.

- IRON CHAINS FED INTO METAL ANKLE CUFFS.

- PAUL D. ON HIS KNEES BEFORE A WHITE GUARD crotch.

Paul awakens.

INT. KITCHEN - DAWN.

Sethe enters to find Paul asleep in the rocker by the stove.

She stirs him.

Sethe begins to make breakfast as Beloved enters the kitchen

and sees Paul has slept in the rocker. She looks at him with

a smile, as if she knows more than she's letting on. Paul

registers the look.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT.

Paul is asleep in the rocker...He is restless...HE DREAMS:

EXT. A ROAD IN VIRGINIA - DAY.

Paul is chained by the ankles to forty-five other men. He

hands are shackled. In his mouth, an iron bit...

The men are being led by WHITE GUARDS with rifles.

Camera follows them under a burning sun as they approach;

A TRENCH. One thousand feet long. Five feet deep. Five feet

wide.

Camera tilts down to reveal, within the trench;

WOODEN BOXES, with scrap limber roofs and a door of bars

fitted on them like a cage that opens up to a wall of red

dirt stretching two feet above the top of the bars themselves.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT.

Paul awakens...his face and body drenched in sweat.

EXT. FIELD BETWEEN 124 AND THE STOREROOM - NIGHT.

Paul D. walks across the field with a thin blanket over his

nightclothes - walking toward the storeroom.

In the window of her bedroom, Sethe watches him - sensing he

is moving further and further away from her.

In the window of Denver's room, Beloved watches Paul as well -

with a pleased expression.

PAUL'S MEMORIES;

EXT. A FIELD IN GEORGIA - DAY.

A RIFLE SHOT. A WHITE GUARD SHOUTS;

EXT. TRENCH - DAY.

Three white Men walk along the trench unlocking the cage

doors one by one...

One by one, the Black men emerge and stand in a line in the

trench.

When all are assembled, A SECOND RIFLE SHOT signals them to

climb out of the trench to the ground above.

Waiting for them above the trench, is one thousand feet of

chain. Each Black Man bends over and waits as the First Man

on line threads the chain through his leg iron, passing it to

the second and so on...

As they connect each other to the chain, Camera Pans down the

line of men and while not a word is spoken, WE HEAR THEIR

THOUGHTS...thoughts to themselves, or, if possible, through

their eyes to the man beside them:

THE BLACK MEN ARE CHAINED AND KNEELING IN A STRAIGHT LINE.

The White Guards walk passed them. one White Guard stops in

front of the man beside Paul D. He turns to him.

The White Guard unzips his fly and undoes his pants and moves

a step closer to the Black Man's mouth.

Paul D. looks ahead, trembling...He vomits...The Guard steps

away as another Guard steps in and hits Paul on the shoulder

with a rifle..

EXT. FIELD - DAY.

The Black Men work...sledge hammers in hand...

As they work, miraculously, THEY SING.."They sing about the

women they knew, the children they had been...they sing of

bosses and masters and misses...of mules and dogs and the

shamelessness of life...They sing of sisters long gone. They

sing love songs to Death."

INT. TRENCH - NIGHT.

A torrential downpour. The men in the wooden cages watch the

rain filling the trench, corroding the red dirt wall around

them.

Bugs and human debris swirl around their legs and feet. Mud

covering them through the cracks of the scrap lumber roof.

Some finds rest. other's minds are long gone.

Camera finds Paul...HE IS SCREAMING. But there is no sound

coming from his mouth. Tears flow down his face, but when he

touches them, he realizes;

They are tears of mud. He looks up and the wooden planked

roof is breaking under the power of the rain..He looks down

and the water is up to his thighs.

Suddenly, the chain linking his feet is pulled and he is

knocked down..He gets up, searches through the mud for the

chain and notices it's slack..He pulls as well....

One by one the men in the boxes realize the chain's end is

being undone by the rain, as camera tracks down towards the

last box to the dirt wall, into which the chain has been

locked...It is giving way within the muddy wall.

THE MEN BREAK THROUGH THE ROTTED WOOD ROOFS TO FREEDOM...

WIDE ANGLE;

AS THE MEN CLIMB OUT OF THE MUDDY COFFINS, GRASPING FOR A

HOLD, CRAWLING WITH EVERY MUSCLE OF THEIR BODIES - TO GET OUT

OF THE TRENCH before mud and water drown them....

Paul climbs with the will of ten men, with every ounce of

strength he has left...

END of MEMORY.

INT. COLD ROOM - A WINTER NIGHT.

Paul D. is wide awake. The memories won't let him sleep.

Winter has arrived and the night is cold. He lies underneath

a thin blanket in yet another sleeping place, even further

from the house. He adds newspapers under and around his body

to stay warm.

He looks as if he has given up on sleeping altogether. He

hears the door to the cold room open. But he does not turn to

look.

Beloved enters the cold room.

She hoists up her skirt and turns her head away.. Paul stares

at a silver lard can so as not to look.

Paul continues to stare at the lard can - like Lot's wife,

he's fearful what turning to look will do.

Beloved moves closer, right up behind him, entwining her arms

around his body, like chains..

Tears well up in his eyes. Paul can feel her warmth. He

surrenders.

Beloved presses her body against his. He turns and grabs her,

kissing her with a passion bordering on hatred.

EXT. COLD HOUSE - NIGHT.

Denver sits outside the cold house - and listens to the

sounds of lovemaking. And cries.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT.

Sethe, Denver, Paul and Beloved eat dinner...in silence.

INT. COLD HOUSE - ANOTHER NIGHT.

Beloved is wrapping her body with a blanket as Paul lies on

his bed of newspapers - their lovemaking finished. Beloved

gives him a final look - no tenderness or affection or even

friendliness. Just a cold look, void of respect or even

attraction.

She exits the cold house, leaving Paul alone. He is on the

verge of tears.

INT. SETHE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT.

Paul stands above the sleeping Sethe - his guilt driving him

mad. He wants to touch her, to wake her, to ask for

forgiveness and help. But he can not and buries his head in

his hands.

EXT. SAWYER RESTAURANT - LATE AFTERNOON.

Paul waits outside in the cold, cupping his hands and

breathing inside to keep them warm. He is rehearsing:

Sethe appears, exiting the back door of the restaurant with a

scrap pan in the crook of her arm. To her surprise. she finds

Paul waiting for her.

She tosses the bones and skins from the scrap pan into a heap

before four dogs who wait there as if by appointment.

She enters the restaurant. Paul watches the dogs eat -

watching them getting what they wanted. Sethe re-appears with

a cloth over her head.

Sethe steps forward to hear what Paul came to tell her. There

is no apprehension or anger in her look. Instead, a calm

resolve - as if she were already able to accept whatever he

had to tell her without it being anyone's fault. As if she

already knew he cane to say he was leaving her. She smiles.

Paul knows what she's expecting. And when he sees her

diminished expectation, the melancholy without blame in her

eyes....he can't tell her about Beloved. He is filled with

respect and admiration for her in that moment. Something pops

into his head and out of his mouth that wasn't planned;

Sethe breaks up with laughter. Paul joins in.

She slips her fingers into his.

Paul lifts them, putting the tips of her fingers on his

cheek. He smiles broadly;

She laughs, shaking her head. A burden transformed into a

gift, so suddenly. They begin walking.

Sethe and Paul catch and snatch each other's fingers,

stealing quick pats on the behind, joyfully. Paul throws his

arm around Sethe and squeezes. She lets her head touch his

chest. They stop and stay that way for a moment - not

breathing. Sethe closes her eyes. Paul looks up to the trees

lining the roadside like defending arms against attack.

Softly, suddenly, it begins to snow. Sethe opens her eyes:

EXT. BLUESTONE ROAD - EARLY EVENING.

On the road towards 124, Paul and Sethe run hand in hand.

Snow falling all around them.

They slow to a walk.

Before she can stop him, Paul hoists Sethe up over his

shoulders.

They continue laughing and moving down Bluestone Road when

they are jolted by the appearance of;

Beloved. Waiting in her usual place for Sethe. Her hands

wrapped in a long shawl, waiting to be given to Sethe. Her

eyes only on Sethe, not even acknowledging Paul's presence.

Sethe gets herself down from Paul.

She takes the shawl from Beloved's hands and wraps it around

her shoulders.

She walks on ahead with Beloved. Paul, suddenly icy cold and

filled with anger, walks behind.

EXT. 124 BLUESTONE ROAD - NIGHT.

Denver waits on the porch. Sethe and Beloved walk by her.

Sethe and Beloved enter the house. As Paul approaches, he

stops before Denver. Their eyes meet. Paul stares at her, as

if to ask - "Who's ally are you?"...Denver, unnerved by his

look, runs into the house. Paul waits on the porch until, a

moment later, Sethe re-appears.

As if healed by her strength, Paul's face melts into relief.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT.

Denver is cleaning the dishes. Beloved sits like an angry,

upset five year old with her fingers in her mouth.

Beloved didn't consider that. Her fingers move violently in

her mouth as if something were bothering her...until,

finally, she pulls out a back tooth...her lips slightly

bloody.

Beloved, eases herself into Denver's arms, and cries...

EXT. WINDOW OF 124 - NIGHT.

We see Sethe and Paul united as the snow begins to pile up.

INT. SETHE'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT.

Sethe lies with Paul, in the dark, her face looking up to the

ceiling. Paul is asleep.

On her face are reservations. She rises, crossing to the

window to look out.

At the same time, Beloved appears silently at the doorway of

the room, looking at Sethe - hurt and sad. She walks by

without Sethe noticing her.

Sethe takes a breath at the window, watching the snow fall.

Then, as she moves back to the bed,...

Camera moves ahead of her to:

A DIFFERENT BED IN WHICH HALLE IS TRYING TO FALL ASLEEP. A

YOUNGER SETHE CRAWLS IN BESIDE HIM.

WE ARE IN MEMORY;

INT. HALLE & SETHE'S SWEET HOME LIVING QUARTERS - NIGHT.

Sethe, Halle and the baby girl (Beloved) sleep together by

the wall. The boys sleep together under a window.  Halle is

trying to sleep but Sethe is awake...

That phrase "..while the boys is small"..causes Sethe to look

at her sleeping boys..

Halle raises himself up to face her, to give her the final blow.

Sethe understands, looks to her sleeping children and is

frightened.

EXT. SWEET HOME - A DAY REMEMBERED.

Sethe carries a big basket of berries as young Howard and

Bulgar run ahead of her. She turns in the opposite direction

and walks along the side of the house to the back entrance of

the kitchen.

She passes the open window of the classroom and hears;

Hearing her name, Sethe stops and peeks through the window.

Schoolteacher is standing over the student, who has been

writing in a notebook. Schoolteacher licks his finger and

thumbs a couple of pages before saying;

Although Sethe doesn't entirely understand, something about

the words disturb her. She looks to her children.

INT. MRS. GARNER'S BEDROOM - A DAY REMEMBERED.

Mrs. Garner is sick in bed with a goiter. Sethe enters with

some soup.

Sethe helps her drink a glass of cold water.

As Sethe fills Mrs. Garner's basin with fresh water, she

looks out the window and sees:

SCHOOLTEACHER outside with his students, we notice HE WEARS A

VERY DISTINCTIVE HAT as Mrs. Garners description continues;

INT. BARN - A NIGHT REMEMBERED.

Sethe lies beaten and raped, her clothes torn, her body

aching and sweaty. She struggles to get to her feet and exit

the barn.

INT. HALLE AND SETHE'S LIVING QUARTERS - NIGHT.

Sethe opens the door to find her children asleep. She is

about to wake them when;

She notices Mrs. Garner's light is on in her bedroom window.

Sethe, blind with rage, decides there's one thing she must do

before she takes her children to the meeting place.

INT. MRS. GARNER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT.

Mrs. Garner lies ailing through a sleepless night when her

bedroom door opens. Sethe enters - her appearance tells all.

EXT. SWEET HOME - NIGHT.

Sethe carried her baby girl in one arm, her two boys by the

hand with the other...They move as fast as they can.

EXT. CORN FIELD - NIGHT.

They arrive at the meeting place where A WOMAN crouching in

the field is waiting.

Sethe carefully hands her baby girl to the woman.

She kisses her baby girl, a little too hard perhaps, waking

her...along with the boys...

Sethe disappears back into the corn field leaving the Woman

holding the baby girl... as Bulgar cries out.

EXT. CORN FIELD CLOSER TO SWEET HOME HOUSE - NIGHT.

Sethe exits the corn field and heads for her living quarters

when suddenly;

THE FOUR BOYS appears from out of nowhere..two restraining

her, one holding a horsewhip....

Sethe struggles and is about to scream out when she is

slapped and muffled and dragged into the corn field to be

beaten.....

END OF MEMORY;

INT. SETHE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT.

Sethe awakens, sweating from having fallen asleep and

reliving her past nightmare. She sits up and realizes where

she is. She looks beside her and sees Paul asleep. She lays

down, pressing her body against his so that there is no space

between - enfolding her arms around him.

EXT. PIG SLAUGHTERHOUSE - DAY.

Pigs are crying in the chute as Paul, Stamp Paid and twenty

other workers push and prod them towards the slaughterhouse.

Although steeped in pig shit on a wintry day - his hands numb

from the cold - Paul D. is in high spirits. HE SINGS as he

works much to the amusement of his fellow co-workers.

The men laugh. Paul smiles and brushes it off.

Stamp Paid's face registers sudden concern.

The truth of this causes the men to be silent as they

continue working. Stamp Paid looks at Paul, confused by what

he should do.

EXT. PIG SLAUGHTERHOUSE - LATER THAT DAY.

The men are on break. Paul sits alone enjoying a lunch packed

by Sethe...Stamp Paid approaches and sits beside him.

Stamp Paid looks at him with sympathetic, sudden

understanding.

Stamp Paid pulls out AN OLD NEWSPAPER CLIPPING from a bag he

carries with him all the time. He hands it to Paul who looks

to see:

A DRAWING OF A YOUNG BLACK WOMAN beneath a HEADLINE; MURDER!

RUNAWAY SLAVE KILLS CHILD....

Paul senses something terribly wrong...and doesn't know

whether to say yes or no.

EXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - EARLY EVENING.

Sethe is sweeping the porch.

Paul appears on the road. When he sees Sethe on the porch in

the distance, he stops.

Sethe sees him and smiles - but something about his slow

approach to the house sends off an alarm within her.

Paul makes his way to the porch. He stops before her.

Paul doesn't answer. Instead, he steps up to her as he

removes the clipping from his pocket and hands it to her.

Sethe's heart stops beating for a moment - not having seen

this image for many years. But she's survived worse than the

telling so she faces him.

She rises and enters the house. Paul follows.

INT. KITCHEN - EARLY EVENING.

Paul sits at the table. Sethe begins her story seated before

him.

She looks for a response but expects none.

She rises and begins to move about the room, circling Paul

as she tries to find a way to explain it all;

MEMORY... as SETHE NARRATES:

INT. SETHE'S ROOM AT 124 - A DAWN REMEMBERED.

Sethe, out of habit, is awake before the sun has risen. She

is fully dressed.

She sits on the bed, watching the sun rise.

INT. THE CHILDREN'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS.

Sethe watches her children sleeping, safely.

Denver is asleep in a bassinet. Sethe reaches in and picks

her up. She sits by a window and breast feeds her as she hums

A MELODY. (This is the same melody we heard Sethe humming in

the beginning of the film).

Sethe's melody carries itself over the following images;

EXT. 124 BLUESTONE ; WATER PUMP - DAY.

Sethe is carrying a bucket of water to the house. She sees:

Bulgar and Howard running and playing. Howard tackles his

brother and starts tickling him. The two boys laugh hard.

Sethe watches, a moment of fear across her face;

Sethe realizes, placing down the bucket:

Sethe sobs, uncontrollably.

INT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - DAY.

Ella teaches Sethe a new stitch as she chatters on.

EXT. FIELD - DAY.

Another woman teaches Sethe the alphabet, as Sethe cradles

Denver and the Little Girl (Beloved) crawls around her feet.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY.

Baby Suggs and Sethe cook with a kitchen full of men and

women who have come for a visit.

Two men get into an argument to the amusement of the women.

EXT. CLEARING IN THE WOODS - DAY.

As folks gather to hear Baby Suggs preach, she introduces a

smiling, shy Sethe to each one.

Alone for a moment, Sethe looks around at the crowd of faces;

Sethe's Melody stops as Baby Suggs stands on her rock and

calls to the crowd:

FROM OUT OF THE WOODS, CHILDREN RUN INTO THE CLEARING.

Camera follows the joyous exodus to reveal:

THE CLEARING IS FILLED WITH ADULTS the entire black

community of the days when Sethe first arrived. The children

run to their respective families;

The children, loving the game, laugh hard. The adults get a

kick out of it.

Sethe watches her boys and hides her laughter.

OUT OF THE WOODS, A GROUP OF GROWN MEN COME INTO THE CLEARING.

The men form a circle and dance as the crowd supports them

with a clapping rhythm. A SONG arises from the women to

accompany to dance....

Camera follows those women who are not singing as one by one,

they remember and weep...

Sethe watches...and weeps.

EXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - DAY.

Stamp Paid walks up to the porch carrying a TWO BIG BASKETS

OF BLACKBERRIES ... his body dirty, scratched and bleeding.

He places the baskets on the porch in front of Baby Suggs,

Sethe who is holding Denver..and the Little Girl (Beloved).

He puts one into Denver's mouth.

Stamp exits.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY.

Sethe and Baby Suggs and Ella and several other women cook.

EXT.THE FIELD/124 BLUESTONE RD. - EVENING.

Various images of people gathered enjoying food and

drink...laughing and singing...

- Women serving up the food...

- Older men sitting and talking as they eat...

- Younger men playing with the children. Chasing them with

sheets on their backs, scaring them into laughter..

- A Man with a guitar playing a blues song and singing.

While Sethe enjoys her free life and, most of all, her

children - the boys running around her..Denver in her

arms..Her Little Girl (Beloved) by her side.. Baby Sugg's

visits with various guests, serving up the food...

INTERCUT; Images of whispers exchanged between some of the

women:

Women head to head with a remark or an eye of disapproval

towards Baby Suggs as she continues cooking and feeding....

EXT. THE FIELD/ 124 BLUESTONE RD. - THE FOLLOWING DAY.

Baby Suggs works the field, not far from Stamp Paid...

She chops at the soil over the roots of the pepper plants.

She stops - sensing something is wrong. She looks up at a

clear blue sky...She hears the birds and the stream way down

beyond the woods..

She looks around and sees Bulgar, Howard and the Little Girl

(Beloved) playing with loud voices by the side of the house.

She sees Sethe squatted in the pole beans with Denver in a

bushel basket beside her.

The clok, clok of wood being chopped causes her to look over

to Stamp Paid, helping out with the axe...

She returns to her work...but something is deeply wrong.

And then she hears it;

THE SOUND OF HORSES and A HORSE DRAWN WAGON coming from the

distance. (The same sound Sethe heard in her first memory of

the sycamores earlier on)

She rises up and looks;

POV;

EXT. BLUESTONE ROAD - DAY.

Far in the distance, FOUR HORSEMEN ARE RIDING TOWARD THEM.

ONE DRIVES A WAGON and IS WEARING A DISTINCTIVE HAT - IT IS

SCHOOLTEACHER.....

EXT. THE FIELD OF 124 BLUESTONE - DAY.

Sethe continues working until she notices peripherally that

Baby Suggs is standing stock still, staring at something.

Sethe rises and looks in the same direction;

EXT. BLUESTONE ROAD - DAY.

The Four Horsemen are closer...

EXT. THE FIELD OF 125 BLUESTONE - DAY.

Sethe's face freezes in terror as ...

Stamp Paid, in between chops, looks up and sees the two

women..then turns his face to see the men.

BUT IT IS SETHE'S FACE WE CONCENTRATE ON - AS WE INTERCUT THE

ONCOMING APPROACH OF THE FOUR HORSEMEN and HEAR HER WORDS:

Over the above speech, we see in Sethe's expression a death

of soul - an instantaneous loss of hope for possibilities of

joy and life. And with it, an insane rage.

Sethe grabs Denver out of the basket, then scrambles after

the crawling Little Girl (Beloved), scooping her under her

free arm...

The tone of her voice cause the boys to freeze. She runs

towards them, grabbing one by the hand and ordering the other

to run in front of them. She moves and speaks with efficient

clarity.

Baby Suggs and Stamp Paid watch helplessly -

EXT. 124 BLUESTONE -

The Four Horsemen - Schoolteacher, his Nephew, a Slave

Catcher and a Sheriff - arrive at the house and dismount,

tying their horses to the front gate (which is no longer

there).

The Nephew scampers to the front of the house and peers in

the window - he listens. Hearing nothing he motions for them

to go round the side of the house.

Camera follows them as it reveals Baby Suggs and Stamp Paid

standing exactly where we left them...Except;

They are both staring at the shed - out of which strange

noises, thuds and the FRIGHTENED CRIES OF CHILDREN are heard....

Two Black Boys and several Woman are coming up the road. The

Slave Catcher motions with his rifle for them to stop - and

they do.

The men move towards the shed, meeting up with the Nephew as

he runs past Baby Suggs and Stamp Paid...

POV;

Camera moves closer towards the shed, the sounds coning from

within more audible now...

INT. THE SHED -

The Nephew opens the door. The Four Men enter....

Howard and Bulgar are bleeding in the sawdust, unconscious -

a bloody shovel lays near them.

Sethe is holding a blood-soaked Little Girl (Beloved) to her

chest with one hand...and Denver by the heels of the other.

She is swinging Denver toward the wall planks, misses then

tries again...

When out of nowhere, Stamp Paid rushes by the horrified white

men and GRABS DENVER OUT OF SETHE'S HAND before she can swing

her a second time...

Stillness.

Schoolteacher looks at the carnage...a bloody saw lies at

Sethe's feet, the weapon she used on her own child's throat.

The Nephew is paralyzed...horrified.

Baby Suggs walks in. Whatever amount of God's grace she could

imagine and will into being, vanishes with one look into that

shed.

Schoolteacher beats his hat against his thigh and spits in

the shed before exiting, followed by the catcher and the

nephew.

The Sheriff speaks to Sethe.

Sethe doesn't move.

Meanwhile, Baby Suggs notices who breathes and who does not

and moves straight to the boys....

Stamp Paid extends his arm to Sethe.

Sethe turns to him, the first time she's looked into anyone's

eyes and sees Denver in his arms...A sound escapes from her

throat as though she'd made a mistake.

He exits. Baby Suggs rubs the boys' hands, tries to raise

their eyelids, spits on her dress and wipes away the blood as

they slowly regain a dazed consciousness..She whispers;

EXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. -

Sethe, clutching the dead baby to her chest, is led out of

the shed by Stamp Paid,

Outside, a throng of black faces have gathered who stop

murmuring the second they see her. Among them are Ella and

Lady Jones. They are shocked and pained.

Sethe is led past them to a waiting cart - in total silence.

Baby Suggs, at the same time, is getting the boys up the

porch into the house. When Denver cries in Stamp Paid's arms,

she stops..lets the boys sit and runs towards the cart.

Sethe is seated in the cart beside the Sheriff. Baby Suggs

takes the crying Denver from Stamp Paid..She tells the

Sheriff.

Baby Suggs approaches Sethe who sees Denver crying and

reaches for her without letting the baby go. Baby Suggs

resists;

But Sethe only wants her living child. The two women struggle

as Stamp Paid does what he can..Finally, Sethe wins and takes

Denver with her free hand, undoes her dress and nurse's her

with a bloody breast..

Baby Suggs breaks inside. Breaks right in two, although from

outwards appearances, she looks merely numbed by shock.

A WHITE BOY makes his way through the crowd with a pair of

shoes and hands them to her..

Baby Suggs looks at him not understanding..

PRESENT DAY (END OF MEMORY) :

INT. 124 BLUESTONE ROAD - NIGHT.

Paul D. sits at the kitchen table. The story told. Sethe

looks out the window...and waits..

That jumped out before he had a chance to choose saying it.

Sethe has no response...The distance between these two people

in this small room is suddenly vast.

Paul rises, playing with his hat...not knowing how to leave.

But desperately needing to. He moves to the exit and stops..

Unable to look at her, he turns to exit. When Sethe speaks in

a soft, forgiving tone, he stops to listen;

Paul turns to look at her and realizes she saw right through

him...

Unable to bear it, Paul turns and leaves...

Sethe stands still, fighting tears, and whispers...

INT. KITCHEN - DAY.

Sethe is scrubbing the floor, with Denver trailing by with

dry rags.

Beloved enters holding a pair of ice skates;

Sethe and Beloved look up. Sethe smiles;

Sethe takes the skates and looks at them with a curious

lightness:

Denver and Beloved register hopefulness in the light of

Sethe's attitude. Sethe speaks to Denver;

The girls get excited. Sethe tosses the scrub brush into the

pail.

EXT. A FROZEN CREEK - DAY.

A bright, cold winter day. Beloved wears a pair of old

skates. Denver wears the second pair and Sethe has one skate

and one shoe..The two girls giggle and fall as they try to

skate on the ice... helping each other up. Their skirts

whirling...their laughter mingled with screams of delight.

Sethe, wearing only shoes, watches them and laughs.

Sethe steps onto the ice and takes a few strides and promptly

falls on her rear. The girls scream with laughter. Sethe

tries to get up and falls, their laughter infecting her as

well. The girls try to help her and fall over each other in

the trying.

Denver rises and tries an independent glide. The tip of her

skate hits a bump and she falls, flapping her arms wildly.

All three laugh so hard, they start coughing. Beloved goes to

Denver's aid.

Sethe rises up on her hands and knees, her laughter shaking

her chest and causing her eyes to tear in the cold air.

Beloved helps Denver, and falls as well. The two girls see

Sethe laughing and play it up even more, a few more times...

Until, Denver notices something and motions Beloved to stop

and look.

The two glide back to Sethe. Her laughter has stopped, but

her tears have not... They gently, comfortingly, touch her

shoulder.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT.

It is a snowy night outside the windows.

Sethe has laid out blankets and quilts in front of the fire

in the stove. She has made sweet milk that she hands to the

girls before taking her place in between them, on the floor,

facing the fire; Denver, on her right, rests her head on her

lap. Beloved sits on her left.

She looks over to Beloved who is staring at the fire. The

illumination highlights her beauty and her profile; the chin,

mouth, forehead - all copied and exaggerated in a huge shadow

the fire threw on the wall. Sethe can't help but stare as

another thought occurs to her;

Beloved lifts her head towards the fire at the same time she

leans back to rest on a propped-up pillow. In the flickering

of the firelight, Sethe can see:

A SMILE OF A SCAR BENEATH HER CHIN.

Sethe knows before she's aware of it consciously. And just as

it hits her, BELOVED BEGINS TO HUM A MELODY.

Sethe recognizes it as her own melody.

Denver lifts her head from her mother's lap to look at Sethe,

knowing what is happening....

Beloved turns to Sethe;

A click. Sethe looks at her daughter, returned. "There is no

gasp of astonishment - no exclaim for the miraculous. For

what is truly miraculous is so, because the magic lies in the

fact that you knew it was there for you all along."

MORNING;

INT. KITCHEN - MORNING.

It's snowy white outside. The girls are still asleep in front

of the stove. But Denver awakens upon hearing her mother load

the stove with dry wood and begin to cook breakfast. Sethe

hears her wake up and turns, as she beats eggs in a bowl;

Beloved snores lightly beside her;

Denver smiles - but it is a cautious smile. Something about

her mother's statement both elates and disturbs her.

EXT. BLUESTONE RD. - DAY.

A conflicted and contrite Stamp Paid walks through the snow

down Bluestone road towards 124.

As he does, he remembers his last conversation with Baby

Suggs;

MEMORY:

EXT. RICHMOND STREET - DAY.

A fall day. Leaves ankle high. Stamp Paid is walking when he

sees baby Suggs carrying a carpetbag full of repaired shoes.

He crosses over to her as he gets her attention;

Baby Suggs turns to her old friend - but there is no sign of

welcome or recognition. There is a noticeable change in her

demeanor. She continues walking. He follows;

He reaches for the carpetbag but Baby Suggs pulls it away.

They walk a bit, until;

Two whitemen raking leaves look up at the sound of Stamp

Paid's voice, which was too loud. So he whispers;

He stops her, before the Twin Chestnuts of the Tucker house.

They exchange a look of silence and finality. She turns and

walks to the back door of the house and knocks. A moment

later a White Woman appears, takes the carpetbag and keeps

Baby waiting on the back steps while she goes in for a dime.

Baby rests on the railing until the whitewoman returns.

MEMORY END.

EXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - DAY.

Now, Stamp Paid feels the need to find out what's going on

inside 124 since he caused Paul to leave. He approaches the

porch, then the front door. He raises his hands to knock -

but he can't bring himself to do it.

He turns to walk away then stops. He turns back and with a

force of will, KNOCKS LOUDLY upon the door. No answer. He

KNOCKS AGAIN. Still no answer.

He steps back, trying to sense if anyone's there. He turns to

leave when he sees;

TWO HEADS in the window. Denver and Beloved. Denver bolts

away, but Beloved remains a moment longer - looking in Stamp

Paid's eye, then disappearing into the house.

Stamp Paid is unnerved by her look.

INT. SAWYER'S RESTAURANT - LATE MORNING.

Sethe enters late, putting on her apron as SAWYER yells;

Sethe begins organizing her counter to make pies.

Sethe ignores him as she begins. Sawyer is at a loss.

INT. ELLA'S HOUSE - DAY.

Ella opens the front door for Stamp Paid. He looks disturbed.

Stamp takes off his hat and follows Ella, who is doing

laundry in the kitchen.

Ella shrugs and continues folding wet laundry on a line

behind the stove. Stamp sits.

Beat. Ella knows he's right. She surrenders the truth.

Stamp knows what she thought.

Stamp can not deny this.

EXT. BLUESTONE ROAD - EARLY EVENING.

Sethe is walking home to her daughters. There is a serene,

introverted expression on her face...as if she were detached

from the world around her, safe inside. We hear her thoughts:

DENVER'S VOICE OVER FADES IN OVER SETHE'S....

INT. 124 BLUESTONE ROAD - EARLY EVENING.

Denver is cleaning the kitchen, waiting for her mother. We

hear her thoughts:

BELOVED'S VO FADES IN OVER DENVER'S...

EXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - EARLY EVENING.

Beloved, waiting for Sethe to come home, sees her

approaching. We hear her thoughts:

Sethe comes to the waiting Beloved and smiles. She offers her

hand and Beloved rises. Denver exits to them and smiles. She

extends her hand to Beloved's free hand. The three women

stand astride each other, arms around each other's waist as

they walk toward the porch...

The dusk sunlight creates THREE SHADOWS - three figures

holding each other the way Sethe saw the shadows at the

carnival...Only they weren't Hers, Denver's and Paul's...They

were Hers, Denver's and Beloved's....

INT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - EARLY EVENING.

The girls rush into the house, and down the hall.

Sethe enters. Then turns back to the door.

C.U. ; OF SETHE'S HAND LOCKING THE FRONT DOOR AS WE HEAR;

I AM BELOVED AND SHE IS MINE..     DENVER (VO)

OVER THE FOLLOWING CHORUS OF DIALOGUE, A MONTAGE OF

IMAGES DEPICTING SETHE, BELOVED AND DENVER CLOSING UP

THE HOUSE FROM THE OUTSIDE WORLD - LOWERING SHADES,

LOCKING WINDOWS, BARRING DOORS.....

TELL ME THE TRUTH..              BELOVED (VO)

EXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - EARLY EVENING.

CAMERA PULLS BACK FROM THE FRONT DOOR, NOW LOCKED AGAINST THE

WORLD, IN A SLOW MOVE....AS WE HEAR A BLEND OF THE THREE

WOMEN'S VOICES - THE OVERLAPPING, HAUNTED THOUGHTS OF THE

LIVING...

BY THE TIME THE CAMERA REACHES BLUESTONE ROAD, THE VOICES ARE

MIXED, UNDECIPHERABLE YET AUDIBLE...

...AUDIBLE TO STAMP PAID, WHO STANDS ON BLUESTONE RD.

LISTENING TO THE HAUNTED VOICES OF 124.  HE IS FRIGHTENED.

FADE- IN:

EXT. CHURCH - DAY.

A cold day. Paul D. sits against the church drinking from a

bottle when a voice causes him to look up;

Stamp has his hands in his pockets, moving about.

Stamp sits beside him.

He drinks from the bottle like an angry, broken man. It stabs

at Stamp's heart to see him like this.

A WHITE MAN in a horse and wagon drives up the path leading

to the church. He leans stops before them and leans forward;

Paul drinks from the bottle. The White Man addresses him.

Paul offers no response. The White Man clicks his tongue and

drives off. Stamp breathes a sigh of relief.

He drinks.

And then Paul realizes he's talking of Sethe.

Paul thinks a moment. Then, tears brimming in his eyes:

FADE IN;

SPRING.

EXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - MORNING.

The sun shines on a warm April day..a day abundant with

growth and renewed hope.

But a shadow appears to be hovering over 124. It looks more

worn than before...neglected, abused.

A broken window...the front door off it's hinge...a front

step splintered and dangerous.

INT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - MORNING.

Camera opens on the front hall and moves through the house,

revealing the same neglect inside;

Broken furniture, dusty floors, mess and disorder...

Camera enters;

INT. KITCHEN - MORNING.

Dirty pans, crusted food on the table, window curtains

hanging askew...

Sethe sits hunched over, asleep, in a chair against the wall.

She wears a dirty, torn dress that hangs on her body - which

seems withered, frailer since we last saw her...In her lap

lies a clean pretty dress she was in the process of sewing

when she fell asleep from fatigue.

A LOUD CRASH wakes her up. Followed by a LOUD FRUSTRATED

YELL. Her face registers fear. She realizes where she is,

what time it is...and begins organizing breakfast...

She places the dress neatly on the chair, then grabs a cloth

and wipes away the crumbs and dirty plates from supper,

placing them in the sink...

She opens a pantry cupboard to reveal BARE SHELVES except for

a SINGLE EGG and a bowl of HOMINY GRAINS about 1/4 full. She

searches in a panic for more food - anywhere - opening

cabinets, doors - places that never stored food. She realizes

there is none left.

INT. DENVER'S ROOM - MORNING.

Denver finished dressing. She has been able to maintain a

semblance of order about her person and room..

But as she steps out into the second floor hallway, we see

the same disarray as downstairs...

She passes by Baby Sugg's old room and discovers;

BELOVED, sprawled across the bed, half naked. Her belly is

huge, her body unwashed. She looks, and behaves, like a wild

animal...

A broken lamp lies on the fall - pushed over by her leg as

she shifted in bed. Her feet, overhanging the bed, are still

touching the bedside table where the lamp sat.

She is awake now - making a small hole larger in Baby Sugg's

old quilt.

Beloved jolts her head up to Denver. She doesn't like being

looked at unawares...

Beloved looks at Denver, then at the quilt - then abruptly

tears the hole apart with one strong pull.

Triumphant, she gets out of bed and exits, passing Denver;

INT. KITCHEN - MORNING.

Sethe has prepared all the food that was left and placed it

on one plate which she sets on the table. She stands at the

stove, with her back to us, picking crusted pieces of food

off the bottom of the pan.

Beloved moves straight to the chair in front of the place and

begins to eat, shovelling the food into her mouth.

Denver sees her mother covertly eating the burnt pan crumbs,

as she pretends to wash the dishes.

Sethe turns, not realizing Denver was there as well. Their

eyes meet. Sethe wonders if her daughter saw her eating the

pan crumbs. She smiles;

Knowing there must be nothing left, Denver answers;

Sethe looks relieved.

Denver crosses to the dishes, taking the pan from her mother.

Sethe nods and crosses to the table, to sit down.

But as she sinks into the chair, Beloved kicks it away;

No one pays attention to Denver.

Beloved flings her plate at Sethe, hitting her hard across

the eye..the plate breaking...

Sethe's harsh tone is only for Denver. Denver exits the

kitchen, afraid to leave them alone...

As she moves from the kitchen, she hears;

Denver walks up the white stairs...

INT. BABY SUGGS' ROOM - DAY.

Denver has straightened up her grandmother's room. Cleaned

away the broken pieces of the lamp. Gathered the remnants of

the quilt..

She holds the quilt as she sits on the bed, facing the

headboard. SHE REMEMBERS:

MEMORY:

INT. BABY SUGGS' ROOM - A DAY REMEMBERED.

Baby Suggs, near death, lying in her bed, chuckles and

coughs;

A NINE YEAR OLD DENVER shakes her head.

Denver can't answer.

Baby Suggs face registers the pain of her granddaughter, hurt

by hurtful words.

Denver crawls into her arms.

END OF MEMORY.

INT. BABY SUGGS' ROOM - DAY.

Denver has crawled up and snuggled against the pillow in the

same position as when she was nine in her grandma's arms.

INT. SECOND FLOOR LANDING - DAY.

Denver has changed into a clean, pretty dress and is

approaching the stairs when she passes Sethe's room. It's

door is open. She looks in..

Sethe stands with her back to the door, cleaned up, wearing

her best dress and the hat she last wore to the carnival.

Denver smiles, hopefully;

Sethe turns, startled, to reveal - it is BELOVED in Sethe's

best clothes...When Beloved sees Denver, she smiles

tauntingly and strikes a pose...

Disgusted, Denver exits.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY.

Denver walks down the stairs, entering the kitchen;

Sethe is on her knees, picking up pieces of broken plate. As

she moves the skin on her knees bleeds as it scrapes against

pieces too small to clean.

Sethe continues her work, without even looking at Denver.

Denver pauses a moment, realizing she is of no use here - but

knowing she needs to help her mother somehow.

She looks up to the kitchen, where every cupboard door is

open revealing empty shelves...SHE EXITS - HEADING FOR THE

FRONT DOOR.

INT. FRONT HALL - DAY.

C.U. - FRONT DOOR.

Denver's hands slowly reaches towards the door lock - and

OPENS IT.

EXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - DAY.

Denver opens the door, then pushes the broken screen door off

it's hinge. She closes the door behind her.

She begins her walk from the porch to the road. The first

time she's ever gone alone..not knowing what she will face

beyond the perimeters of her home.

She reaches Bluestone Road and stops. She looks in either

direction and sees not a soul. She takes a breath.

She begins to walk - to get help.

A block from the house, TWO BLACK MEN turn a corner and walk

towards her.

Denver stops, frightened, not knowing what to do.

The TWO BLACK MEN pass her, tipping their hats, saying;

And they walk by. Denver's eyes speak the gratitude she never

got her mouth open in time to reply. Heartened by the

encounter, she picks up speed.

EXT. LADY JONES' HOUSE - DAY.

LADY JONES - a light-skinned black woman with gray eyes and

yellow woolly hair - opens the door to find Denver.

Denver manages to smile.

Unfortunately, Denver can't manage anything beyond the smile.

Lady Jones takes her by the hand and leads her inside.

INT. LADY JONES' HOUSE - DAY.

Tea things sit on a table between them. Denver eats whatever

she can. Lady Jones watches with care and concern.

Denver swallows a bite of something with some tea, then;

Lady Jones can sense something far more serious is going on.

INT. 124 BLUESTONE RD./ KITCHEN - DAY.

Denver brings four eggs, some rice and some tea onto the

kitchen table.

Sethe's eyes well up. She looks at Denver as if for the first

time. Her face an expression of gratitude. Suddenly;

Sethe and Denver rush out of the kitchen to see;

beloved running through the rooms, clawing at her throat,

causing it to bleed...

Sethe and Denver rush towards into the keeping room. Sethe

stumbles over a chair to get to Beloved, kneeling on the

floor, ripping at her own neck...

Denver gets her from behind and Sethe grabs her from the

front, pinning her down - trying to stop her from hurting

herself. Beloved screams and strikes out at Sethe, pulling

her hair, clawing at her as well...

EXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - DAY.

Denver exits the house because she sees something unusual in

the yard;

POV - THE STUMP;

On the same stump that Beloved first appeared, sits A BASKET

OF EGGS. Denver crosses to it, lifts it and a PAPER flutters

to the ground. She reads it;

M. LUCILLE WILLIAMS...

EXT. M. LUCILLE WILLIAMS HOUSE - DAY.

Denver returns the empty basket to M. Lucille Williams.

INT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - DAY.

Beloved eats ravenously from a bowl of white beans. Sethe

sits in the corner, as if waiting to serve her...

EXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - DAY

Upon the stump, sits a plate of cold rabbit meat, which

Denver brings inside.

INT. GRACE'S HOUSE - DAY.

Denver is returning a bowl to Grace, a friendly woman.

INT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - DAY.

Beloved sleeps curled up on the kitchen floor after eating -

her mouth still dirty from the meal...

Sethe, unwashed, her hair uncombed, sits in her corner chair.

She is trying to mend a torn dress.

Denver eats a little from the latest neighborhood gift. She

hears her mother mumbling to herself like a madwoman.

Sethe considers this. She rises cautiously, then sits at the

table. Denver rises and gets her some food, placing it before

her.

Sethe nods...Denver is getting more and more frightened of

losing her mother completely...Instead of protecting Beloved

from Sethe, she must protect her mother from Beloved.

EXT. THE BODWIN'S HOUSE; BACK DOOR - DAY.

A white family home in a white Ohio neighborhood.

JANEY WAGON, a benevolent black servant woman, opens the back

door for Denver.

INT. THE BODWIN'S HOUSE - DAY.

The house is filled with books and pearl white lamps and

glass cases filled with glistening things.

Denver pushes her feet into the soft blue carpet as she sits

with Janey.

During Janey's lines, Denver looks about the house imagining

herself here at night...her eyes happen upon A STATUE OF A

BLACK BOY on his knees, his head thrown back farther than a

head could go, his mouth wide open like a cup and filled with

money for delivery tips. On the pedestal are the words' AT YO

SERVICE;

Denver nods, beaming gratefully - so gratefully that no words

come, only tears... Janey reaches for Denver's hand and holds

it warmly;

Denver looks at her and we know she needs to tell someone.

INT. ELLA'S HOUSE - DAY.

Ella has gathered all the women of the town for a meeting

including Lady Jones, Janey Wagon, M. Lucille Williams,

Grace;

The women agree.

INT. 124 BLUESTONE RD.: KITCHEN - DAYS LATER.

Denver comes down the stairs, entering the kitchen.

Sethe, worn out, looking more beaten and ravaged than before,

stands at the sink with an ICE PICK chopping up ice. Denver

speaks to her, but she does not turn or acknowledge her.

Sethe continues her action as if hypnotized. Denver

approaches her from behind and whispers softly;

Denver touches her gently, but Sethe acts as if she hears and

feels nothing. Denver exits.

EXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - LATE THAT DAY.

Denver is sitting on the stump waiting for Mr. Bodwin when

she hears;

THIRTY WOMEN, gathered together, walking up Bluestone Rd.

towards 124, SINGING A HOLY SONG;

Denver is amazed by the sight as the women position

themselves right in front of 124 - armed with bibles,

crucifixes and whatever other symbols of heavenly power they

could find.

INT. 124 BLUESTONE RD; THE KEEPING ROOM - DAY.

Sethe is rubbing a naked Beloved's forehead with a cool cloth

filled with ice, when the two women hear the singing.

Beloved rises first and moves to the window to see.

EXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - DAY.

The women continue singing.

EXT. FURTHER DOWN BLUESTONE RD. - DAY.

MR. BODWIN, sitting on a wagon pulled by a horse, is riding

toward 124 when he hears the singing as well.

WE NOTICE THAT MR. BODWIN IS WEARING A HAT SIMILAR TO THE ONE

SCHOOLTEACHER WORE on that fateful day.

EXT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - DAY.

The women continue singing as:

Sethe and Beloved, her belly as big as a pregnant woman's,

exit the house.

The women are stunned by the sight and slightly confused by

the lack of fear between the women.

Sethe is holding Beloved's hand. Beloved is smiling brightly

at the beautiful singing.

Denver looks to her mother;

Tears run down Sethe's face but she is not crying. The sound

of the women's voices wash over her like a baptism. She looks

to all the women, faces she remembers, faces she has missed

although up until this moment was not conscious of missing.

Then, Sethe looks beyond the women and sees:

MR. BODWIN APPROACHING IN HIS WAGON. SHE SEES MR. BODWIN

WEARING A HAT THAT LOOKS LIKE SCHOOLTEACHERS.

Sethe's expression turns to fear, then rage. In her ravaged

mind, she thinks it is Schoolteacher coming back...

She releases Beloved's hand and moves forward...

She passes Denver, feeling for the ICE PICK IN HER APRON.

As Mr. Bodwin reaches the thirty women who separate him from

124. HIS EYES FOCUS IN WONDER ON THE NAKED BELOVED AS;

SETHE RUNS TOWARDS HIM AND THE WOMEN, HER HAND EXTENDED

HOLDING THE ICE PICK..

DENVER RUNS AFTER HER. SETHE REACHES THE WOMEN AND LUNGES FOR

BODWIN BUT THE WOMEN SEIZE HER, CREATING A HILL OF BLACK

PEOPLE. SETHE RISING TO THE TOP, HER HAND EXTENDED. DENVER

REACHING HER FROM BEHIND, PULLING HER BACK AND PUNCHING HER

OUT COLD AS THE BODIES FALL AROUND THEM....

Beloved watches from the house - watches Sethe attack and

defend with the ice pick.  And something within her is

resolved. For a moment, we see a calm spirit instead of a

wild animal. And a tear upon her face..

Then, just as quickly, she sprints around the side of the

house and disappears from view.

The Women try to help Sethe as Denver cries for her mother.

Mr. Bodwin looks on stunned.

WIDE ANGLE - OF A NAKED BLACK WOMAN WITH A FULL BELLY RUNNING

THROUGH AN OPEN FIELD, REACHING THE WOODS THEN DISAPPEARING

INTO THE TREES......

FADE IN:

EXT. RICHMOND ST. - DAY. WEEKS LATER.

Paul D. is on his way to work when he sees;

A poised, confident Denver walking in the opposite direction.

She spots him and smiles;

Paul is clearly impressed by the sight of her.

Paul smiles - wanting to warn her but deciding not to spoil

the possibilities that lay before her.

Silence.

She levels her eyes at him and he knows what she means.

They pass each other until Denver turns back;

Paul watches her walk away. He watches as a YOUNG BLACK MAN

runs towards her shouting;

He watches as the two young people, the future, walk

together.

INT. 124 BLUESTONE RD. - DAY.

Paul enters the house and hears HUMMING. He walks towards the

keeping room, whose door is ajar;

INT. KEEPING ROOM - DAY.

Sethe lies in bed with the remnants of Baby Sugg's quilt over

her, as she hums her melody and looks out of the window.

She looks like she's dying.

He approaches her.

Sethe looks at him - a long look - and sees in him that

thing, that blessedness, "that makes him the kind of man who

can walk into a house and make women cry, make women tell him

things they could only tell each other".

Paul leans down and takes her hand, entwining his fingers

into hers...

Sethe smiles, with tears in her eyes, looking almost

surprised;

EXT. THE CLEARING - A DAY OUT OF TIME.

A beautiful, sunny day. The clearing is full. Everyone looks

bright and hopeful. Dressed in bright, summer clothes...

A robust Baby Suggs is on her rock giving her best Call, as

camera pans the crowd of faces eager to believe ....

And with her twisted, broken old body BABY SUGGS BEGINS TO

DANCE AND TWIRL UP ON HER ROCK.

And the crowd gives her music, SINGING IN FOUR PART HARMONY.

CAMERA PANS THE CROWD OF BEAUTIFUL FACES singing together.

Among the crowd, we see FAMILIAR FACES...

WE SEE THE WOMEN WHO SANG AT 124...

WE STAMP PAID, ELLA, JOHN, and LADY JONES...

AND WE SEE SETHE, SURROUNDED BY ALL HER CHILDREN.
