A pure white screen. Idyllic stillness. All of it looking and

feeling like the heavens are supposed to.

After some seconds of calm, water seems to mist the screen

and the slight shifts to the left and then the right suggest

this is a man's P.O.V. Then, suddenly, the white screen is

tugged and we see it was a sheet covering a presumably dead

man.

INT. HOSPITAL, KUWAIT, DAY

One more tug on the sheet and we see, and suddenly hear, from

William Starks' P.O.V. the CHAOS of the hospital around him

as DOCTORS and NURSES tend as best as they can to the injured

soldiers.

Our glimpse of STARKS reveals a red stretcher -- soaked in blood --

and the severe head wound where a bullet's minced his skull.

Then, slowly, steadily, a heartbeat is heard over the muffled

sounds of the hospital and, as his pulse quickens, so does

the pace of the world around him.

INT. HOSPITAL, KUWAIT, DAY

An INTERN, clipboard in hand, stands above STARKS' unmoving

body with another INTERN (2) beside him. INTERN 1 pulls

the rest of the SHEET off of STARKS as the OTHER searches for

his DOG TAGS and gently closes his EYES with her hand.

As the INTERN puts the TAGS back down, she meets STARKS' wide-

open EYES -- now filled with surfacing tears, sadness, and life.

She stares at them curiously and, after some seconds, STARKS

blinks and a TEAR runs down his cheek -- jarring her.

As the MEDICAL STAFF rush over to STARKS, preparing NEEDLES

and OXYGEN MASKS, STARKS merely closes his eyes and we follow

the now BLOODIED white sheet as it falls to the ground...

EXT. IRAQI VILLAGE, DAY

A NEWSANCHOR interviews CAPTAIN ROBERT MEDLEY (30s) -- a

particularly photogenic and affable participant.

EXT. IRAQI VILLAGE, DAY

We see only the HAND, and not the man to whom it belongs,

enter the frame and pull the TRIGGER on a gun. The sound

pierces the air, and the bullet hits the side of STARKS' head

in a FLASH, shaving the skin around it right off.

EXT. AMERICAN NAVAL HOSPITAL, DAY

STARKS convalesces in a navy hospital bed -- his head heavily

BANDAGED and his arms suited with I.V.'s and dressings -- as a

MAJOR, a LIEUTENANT and a DOCTOR stand above him.

STARKS' face -- now cleaned of the blood that masked it before --

is alert, and striking. Even with the bandages, he remains

well-built and strong, like a shot straight to the head would

have been the only way for an enemy to take him down.

When he speaks, STARKS maintains the sharp, steady gaze of a

man assured of himself, even if he is lost among his

surroundings.

STARKS lets the tribute roll right off him. He spots the

CIGARETTES in the Lieutenant's pocket.

The LIEUTENANT lights one for him.

Their VOICES start to fade as STARKS smokes his cigarette,

blowing the SMOKE upwards and following it with his eyes.

He's finished with these men and everything they stand for.

EXT. HIGHWAY, RURAL VERMONT, WINTER, DAY

STARKS -- recovered now -- walks by himself along a long

highway. He seems to be walking away from things even if he

can't remember what they are yet.

EXT. HIGHWAY, RURAL VERMONT, WINTER, DAY

JEAN PRICE (30s) -- a hippie who happens to be a mother -- and

her daughter, JACKIE (8) tremble in the cold next to their

stalled car. JEAN sits next to the car, holding her knees to

her chest, more like a child than her daughter.

JACKIE runs her little gloved hand over her mom's ski-hatted

head as she cautiously watches STARKS approach them. He cuts

an arresting figure against the empty landscape.

STARKS takes off his backpack and kneels down.

JEAN opens her eyes, stone red.

JACKIE decidedly sticks out her gloved hand. STARKS smiles

and briefly shakes it. STARKS rubs a hand over his chin and

cheek as he thinks of what to do.

EXT. HIGHWAY, RURAL VERMONT, WINTER, DAY

As Starks works on their engine, JACKIE anxiously watches her

mother throw up in the distance. STARKS sees her watching and

tries to distract her.

JACKIE looks at him curiously.

STARKS looks at her and smiles at her honest answer; Jackie

turns her head back towards her mother.

JACKIE gets behind the wheel, crouching down in the seat just

enough so her foot reaches the pedal.

JACKIE revs up the engine and, a few coughs and sputters

later, the car settles into a nice, working hum.

JACKIE steps down. She looks like she could hug Starks and,

unexpectedly, decides to. As STARKS awkwardly returns it, he

sees JEAN lifting her eyes to see him holding her daughter.

JEAN reaches for a RIFLE in the back of the truck but

stumbles from the nausea before she can pick it up.

STARKS motions for JACKIE to stop as he collects his bags.

STARKS' DOG TAGS are tied to the ZIPPER of one of his bags.

STARKS unties them and gives them to her. She reads them.

INT. COURTROOM, SMALL TOWN VERMONT

STARKS faces the screen with nothing but a cryptic BLACKNESS

about him and a confused look on his face as a MENACING VOICE

questions him.

STARKS nods.

STARKS nods as a muffled "Objection" flickers away in the

background...

With Starks' answer, the background of the courtroom is

suddenly illuminated and we see that THIS IS STARKS' OWN

TRIAL. The VOICE belongs to a satisfied PROSECUTION who turns

to face a medium-sized CROWD watching on...

INT. COURTROOM, SMALL TOWN VERMONT

There are three KEY WITNESSES called to the stand: CAPTAIN

MEDLEY, Starks' commanding officer in the Persian Gulf; DR.

HALE, a psychiatrist; and OFFICER NASH, the cop who first

came upon the crime scene. Their three testimonies are

intercut to present the case against Starks quickly and

confusingly -- just like it appears to himself.

The following summations are punctuated by the BLACK FADES

between them and the simulated BLACK around them as they

speak -- like STARKS, at the beginning of his own testimony.

EXT. MURDER SCENE, HIGHWAY, VERMONT, DUSK

STARKS lies bleeding -- eyes half open -- by OFFICER HARRISON'S

dead, bloodied body as falling SNOW slowly whitens them both

and covers any FOOTPRINTS that may have been left behind. We

hear a distant gavel delivering a distant judgment...

STARKS' eyes finally close as he lapses into unconsciousness.

INT. COURTROOM, SMALL TOWN VERMONT

The JUDGE nods as he hands the JURY FOREMAN back the verdict.

EXT. HIGHWAY, RURAL VERMONT, WINTER, DAY

In his mind, STARKS is walking out of the woods as the sun

sets and bounces off the snow all around him. We see JACKIE

watching him walk away into the woods.

INT. COURTROOM, SMALL TOWN VERMONT

The JUDGE sentences STARKS, who stares back vacantly, like a

man who checked out of his life long before this judge

decided he had to.

EXT. ALPINE GROVE PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL, DAY

A white VAN pulls up to Alpine Grove Psychiatric Hospital -- a

bleak, dated facility embellished only by the barbed wire

that seems to be everywhere around it.

STARKS' anatomy instantly and intensely separates him from

the staff of the hospital and the infirm patients who might

be in it. TWO MEMBERS of that STAFF lead him in.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, ALPINE GROVE MENTAL HOSPITAL

DR. THOMAS BECKER (overworked, dogmatic, disenchanted), DR.

BETH LORENSON (30s, unassuming, perceptive), and DR. GRIES

(20s, green) are convened with other STAFF at a routine

hospital meeting. These doctors deal in the currency of

madness every day and wear the heaviness of that burden on

their faces.

BECKER shrugs a nod as the Chief moves on to the next order

of business...

INT. STARKS' ROOM, WARD, ALPINE GROVE, DAY

STARKS is shown to his room by NURSE HARDING -- stern, senior --

and her henchman, DAMON -- a BURLY ORDERLY who relishes his

command, however diluted it may be.

DAMON unceremoniously puts Starks' UNIFORM on the bed. He and

NURSE HARDING wait at the door for Starks to change into it.

DAMON looks at STARKS -- his eyes inadvertently conceding that

Starks is more threatening than the common senile he

marshals; STARKS stares him back -- deliberately conceding

that he's right.

STARKS turns around -- only then looking stunned in the

sterile, cotton-white room, wondering where his life

disappeared to.

INT. DR. BECKER'S OFFICE, ALPINE GROVE, DAY

STARKS sits opposite DR. BECKER in a harsh, tiled office.

STARKS wears his blue uniform and BECKER wears a doubtful

expression. From STARKS' P.O.V.: the DRUGS they've already

started giving him BLUR his vision of Becker.

STARKS nods groggily.

BECKER eyes STARKS mistrustfully.

BECKER looks at Starks -- his eyes casting shame upon the

alleged murderer that sits before him.

BECKER glances at his WATCH and gets up -- still blurred in

Starks' P.O.V. It's only as he's walking off that Starks

notices he has a limp.

INT. HALLWAY, ALPINE GROVE, DAY

From STARKS' P.O.V., we follow him walk down the hospital

halls, even hazier from the medication than before. FORMS

blur into one another and, on either side of him is a crazy

world with crazy patients who've lost their way in it.

STARKS reaches for the WALL and runs his HAND over it, trying

to keep his balance. He's walking towards BECKER who stands

at the end of the hall, talking to other PATIENTS.

STARKS falters but stays up. He turns to see a shell of an

OLD MAN looking right through him with wooden eyes. STARKS'

eyes stay so completely fixed on the old man's haunting sight

that he doesn't see what's ahead of him.

He bumps right into a HYSTERICAL PATIENT whose sudden,

earsplitting SCREAMS peal interminably through the air.

STARKS' fumbled efforts to help the PATIENT only feed his

hysteria more. The SCREAMING is intolerable.

ORDERLIES and NURSES, followed by DR. BECKER, surround them

now, violently pulling STARKS off the patient. BECKER,

familiar with the PATIENT (HAROLD), tries to calm him.

STARKS searches their blurred faces and stops on Becker's as

they restrain him and give him more drugs.

INT. STARKS' ROOM, ALPINE GROVE, LATE NIGHT

STARKS is slowly rebounding from the drugs when he hears

disquieting FOOTSTEPS in the hall, coming closer and

closer...

What follows happens too quickly for STARKS to react.

DR. GRIES, NURSE HARDING AND DAMON -- enter Starks' room.

They close the door and deftly administer a TRANQUILIZER and

a GAG.

STARKS has no idea what's happening to him as they drag him

out, and his STIFLED CRIES ensure no one else does either.

INT. MORGUE, BASEMENT, ALPINE GROVE, LATE NIGHT

The first face STARKS sees as the world comes into focus is

NURSE HARDING'S. Around it loom those of DR. BECKER, DR.

GRIES and DAMON.

A shot of the room shows a constraint-ridden apparatus

hanging sternly on the wall. It is THE JACKET: an apparatus

designed to encase a man's body. Made of coarse, sickly-

stained red ands brown canvas and velcro restraints that would

first chafe, then forever burn, the skin they're wrapped

around, the JACKET looks medieval. Its appearance suggests

its purpose: to slowly STRANGLE THE LIFE OUT OF A MAN.

STARKS has been stripped of his blue uniform and is lying

nearly naked on a burial slab in the cold of the basement.

Even under the tranquilizers, STARKS formidably resists them

as the ORDERLIES wrestle to strap him in. Then Starks,

sensing as anyone would, that something bad is being done to

him, wisely stops resisting long enough to petition them.

BECKER motions for them to stop with his hand. STARKS blinks,

trying to bring the faces above him into focus...

BECKER looks into Starks' eyes. Sanity stares back.

BECKER barely nods and STARKS is trussed in the JACKET with

METAL CLAMPS. BECKER writes some details down, presumably

about Starks' treatment.

A CADAVER DRAWER -- just barely deep enough for a body or tall

enough for the height of a nose -- is slid open and STARKS,

already dreadfully sheathed in the JACKET, is crammed inside.

The ORDERLIES slam the cadaver drawer into the wall.

INT. CADAVER DRAWER

STARKS is literally entombed alive. Silence. Stolen breath.

They bolt the drawer and the CLANG echoes through his body.

The BLACKNESS and CLOSENESS of the space choke him as his

heart beats the frantic rhythm of his struggle.

We see only the WHITES of a pair of petrified EYES on a man

who's losing it -- hyperventilating, suffocating... for all

intents and purposes, dying the worst kind of a death.

Combing the walls for any sign of an explanation of what's

happening to him, STARKS sees a single white DOT -- almost

like a fleck of dust -- flitting between undecided SHAPES in

the blackness until, slowly, it grows bigger and bigger...

INT. JACKET/TUNNEL PASSAGE

It's now a PATTERN of WHITE DOTS that changes the more STARKS

stares at it. Beneath it seems to be a smaller pattern with

formless shapes and figures that STARKS tries to discern

before they change into something else. Only after STARKS

blinks does he start to see the WHITE of the DOTS is SNOW

from a picture that is slowly and terribly coming together in

the following glimpses, each hardly longer than the time

between BLINKS.

BLOOD sprays STARKS' hands as he looks down at them and

realizes he's in the scene and not just watching it. He looks

up from his hands and sees in similar flashes...

The only SOUNDS during these dreadful images have been a

trapped man's anxious BREATHS and the BEATS of a HEART

pumping so fast it could be a drum...

The screen goes BLACK and QUIVERS as STARKS clenches his eyes

shut.

INT. CADAVER DRAWER

Just then, as the MUSCLE beneath his eyes starts to VIBRATE,

something terrible and wet falls from the ceiling of the

drawer. PING! Right on his eye. The drop of WATER is enough

to send this man right over the edge.

STARKS' EYES roll back into his head and start to flutter,

shaking the SCREEN right along them until...

INT. MORGUE, BASEMENT, ALPINE GROVE

STARKS stands outside his body, looking at the wall of

drawers he is in. He bends down to look more closely at a

STAIN on the floor -- DRIED BLOOD -- and as he runs his HAND over

it and stands back up, he is back in the...

INT. JACKET/TUNNEL PASSAGE

IMAGES RACE PAST HIM too fast for him to catch anything but

fleeting clips of them. The IMAGES are his MEMORY and, no

matter how badly he wants to slow them down, he can't...

INT. DINER, SMALL TOWN VERMONT

STARKS sees JACKIE, 8, sitting by a window in the diner. She

turns her head towards the ENTRANCE and, as she looks there,

so does Starks. That is when he first lays eyes on a woman, a

WAITRESS -- worn but still lovely -- leaving the diner. He is

taken with her and, for the first time since he's been in the

Jacket, seems calm. Just then, however, the reverie is

shattered...

INT. MORGUE, BASEMENT, ALPINE GROVE, LATE NIGHT

The drawer is yanked open to reveal STARKS' still, drenched

face. BECKER, GRIES and the ORDERLIES stand above him.

The ORDERLIES unstrap the JACKET from his body. Blood from

his chafed skin drips onto the burial slab. STARKS' eyes

remain closed.

We hear BECKER's voice as it sounds to STARKS...MUTED.

STARKS' EYES open only enough for him to see the PEOPLE'S

FACES morph chillingly into one another's.

BECKER looks at STARKS' battered body.

INT. WARD, ALPINE GROVE, NEXT MORNING

STARKS sits, totally disoriented, in the ward with the other,

more vocally INSANE patients. He runs his hand uncertainly

over the SCARS on his arm from the Jacket and looks around --

not knowing where his PARANOIA ends and REALITY begins.

The OLD MAN from the previous day is moving slowly with the

aid of his walker. He is far less threatening to STARKS

today...just a senile man about to walk into a wall.

RUDY MACKENZIE -- 40s, smart eyes, fidgety, with an innocent

face -- watches STARKS help turn the OLD MAN around.

STARKS doesn't offer his hand, just looks back at MacKenzie.

STARKS looks at MACKENZIE and sees that the constant flow of

words from his mouth only masks the tragic hesitation in his

eyes. A dead arm hangs limply by his side, like a weight.

There is, as STARKS rightly figures, no suitable response to

that.

As he talks, MACKENZIE notes the SCARS on Starks' arms. Dr.

LORENSON observes STARKS and MACKENZIE talking and starts

walking towards them.

MACKENZIE winks discreetly at STARKS before he replies.

LORENSON reprimands MacKenzie by turning to Starks.

Just before he walks away, MACKENZIE turns around nervously

and uncharacteristically looks STARKS right in the eye.

STARKS looks at MacKenzie briskly, wondering if his words

were directed or just the meandering of a nut. But MacKenzie

just nods his farewell and starts humming as he walks away --

dead arm in tow.

STARKS looks away. Lorenson gives him a once over.

STARKS looks at LORENSON, seeing if he'll respond. LORENSON

looks back curiously at STARKS' pointed stare.

STARKS walks away slowly and WEAKLY -- a fact that doesn't

escape LORENSON's observation.

INT. MEN'S ROOM, ALPINE GROVE HOSPITAL, DAY

STARKS walks into the bathroom, keenly eyeing the thin slit

of WINDOWS at the top of the wall. He walks closer to them,

when he suddenly hears some STRAINED BREATHING from inside

one of the stalls. He checks the first stall, pushing it

open. It swings both ways since it doesn't have a lock.

The sound continues. STARKS walks slowly past the second

stall to the third and then... WHACK! The door swings all the

way towards STARKS. BRUTALLY. He falls backwards -- his head

just barely missing a fatal confrontation with the sink.

DAMON, the ORDERLY, walks out.

STARKS writhes in PAIN -- straining for his own breath now.

With that, DAMON walks out, leaving STARKS on the floor.

INT. STARKS' ROOM, ALPINE GROVE, NIGHT, CHRISTMAS EVE

STARKS sits in his room, listening to the silence of the

night interrupted by first faint, then approaching,

FOOTSTEPS. Closer and closer...then harmfully near until

DAMON and HARDING enter his room.

They pause -- awaiting a reaction. STARKS doesn't give them

one.

INT. HALLWAY, ALPINE GROVE, NIGHT, CHRISTMAS EVE

STARKS walks stoically down the cold corridors to his own

torture -- flanked by HARDING and DAMON on either side.

INT. MORGUE, BASEMENT, ALPINE GROVE, CHRISTMAS EVE

They're all in the room. STARKS seems pretty calm. Only in a

C.U. do we see his eyes register the JACKET...

STARKS looks at the WIDE, STURDY restraints on it. They would

really hurt if you hit someone as hard as you could with

them. They might even knock someone out...

DAMON and HARDING move to undress him, when STARKS makes a

move to do it himself. They look to DR. BECKER who NODS that

it's all right.

DAMON begrudgingly lets go of Starks but not before he steps

on one of Starks' bare feet.

STARKS doesn't flinch. He merely turns away from them and

bends down to take off his pants. On his way up, he GRABS THE

JACKET OFF ITS HOOK and, using it like a weapon, aims to

smack it across Damon's face. DAMON deftly ducks and the

JACKET hits BECKER instead. The force of the blow sends

Becker down, and as he falls against the wall, DAMON and

HARDING leap to restrain Starks.

BECKER   opens and closes his eyes, trying to get them into

focus.   His right cheek is cut pretty bad. DR. GRIES helps

BECKER   to his feet and picks his BROKEN GLASSES up off the

floor.   BECKER puts them on.

DAMON KICKS Starks hard in the back, nearly sending him down.

BECKER looks down and sees his own BLOOD fall on the floor.

He looks up at STARKS who, even in his pain, looks shocked at

the force he just used.

As soon as they let him go, STARKS lunges for BECKER --

pushing him up against the wall. STARKS stops, presumably

about to harm Becker but unsure, even to himself, of what

he's capable of doing...

BECKER looks fearlessly into Starks' eyes.

STARKS' face registers the meaning in Becker's words and a

look of self-doubt crosses his face.

STARKS lets go of him and, as soon as he does, DAMON and

HARDING restrain him. BECKER calmly wipes the BLOOD from his

face, looks at his hand, shakes his head and walks out.

BECKER doesn't answer. He doesn't even turn around. DR. GRIES

goes after him.

And DAMON and HARDING start to...

INT. BECKER'S OFFICE, ALPINE GROVE, CHRISTMAS EVE, SOME TIME

LATER

BECKER turns around from the window and we see that his cheek

is BANDAGED. He opens a drawer, takes out some SCOTCH and

pours himself a SHOT. He swallows some pills with it.

After he drinks it, he looks up to see GRIES standing

opposite him, watching.

BECKER shakes his head, laughing inside at the world's

stupidity.

BECKER doesn't wait for an answer, just turns back towards

the window and takes another sip of his drink.

INT. HOSPITAL LOUNGE, ALPINE GROVE, CHRISTMAS EVE

NURSE HARDING turns on the television as DAMON sits in one of

the lounge chairs.

HARDING takes out a FLASK from her BACKPACK.

DAMON smiles and rubs his hands together eagerly.

INT. MORGUE, BASEMENT, ALPINE GROVE, CHRISTMAS EVE

A shot of the WALL OF DRAWERS, with no one in the room, just

someone in the wall...

INT. CADAVER DRAWER

STARKS finds himself in the physically wrenching place once

more. But nothing happens for some seconds. He breathes

anxiously, not knowing what to expect. His heart beats

steadily: THUMP...THUMP, until, finally, with each beat, a

SMALL WHITE FLECK becomes two flecks...then, two

dots...then, two circles...then, the WHITES of a pair of

EYES with a terrific meanness in them.

The EYES blink, then disappear like they were never there.

The pace of STARKS' heart quickens, and the inexplicable

madness surrounds him once more...

EXT. MURDER SCENE, HIGHWAY, VERMONT, DUSK

The SOUNDS of BOMBS RAGE around him but he's in the middle of

the murder scene, watching OFFICER HARRISON lie on the floor.

He turns to look over his shoulder and sees...

EXT. IRAQI VILLAGE, NIGHT

Through a PHOSPHORESCENT GREEN NIGHT-VISION CAMERA, we see FIRE,

FLESH, and RUIN littering the sand. Slowly the

terrifying images shift to a naturalistic, real-time

documentation of the action -- the ruin -- as it's occurring.

As STARKS blinks, TEARS fall and he hears, over it all, a

counseling voice...

The TERRIBLE SOUNDS become less terrible as they fade away.

The scene morphs slowly and the following IMAGES appear

vaguely -- forming the walls of the TUNNEL around him.

STARKS walks up uneasily to the wall and touches the IMAGES.

They move like they're liquid and, when they settle, the

whole wall is replaced with one large IMAGE of a BEAUTIFUL

WOMAN -- a waitress -- standing at the counter of a COFFEE

SHOP, moving a STRAND OF HAIR out of her face with her hand.

STARKS blinks slowly -- struck by this dream of her. He reaches

out and closes his PALM around her like he might catch hold

of the moment with this simple gesture.

The whole WALL OF IMAGES twinkles marvelously, as we...

EXT. DINER, SMALL TOWN, VERMONT, CHRISTMAS EVE

The WAITRESS (early 20s) -- tired, with kind eyes, soft skin

and a beautiful mouth that hasn't smiled in a long time --

emerges from the diner. Even with no effort, she is

remarkably pretty.

From her UNIFORM, we know that her day was spent there.

STARKS simply stares at this WOMAN who seems markedly removed

from the world around her. The only fact she wears on her is

that she's tired.

She spots STARKS and can't help but do a double-take. Both

are momentarily taken with each other, though she tries to

hide any indication that she is.

INT. WAITRESS' CAR

She gets in her old car and starts it. As it warms up, she

looks for STARKS in her REARVIEW MIRROR and sees he's still

there.

He starts to walk over to her when she jumps out of her car.

EXT. PARKING LOT, DINER, VERMONT, CHRISTMAS EVE

The WAITRESS treads angrily towards STARKS.

STARKS looks at her. He doesn't know anymore than she does.

STARKS just stares.

She turns and gets back in her car, slamming the door shut.

She starts to drive and STARKS stares after her.

After a few hundred yards, she SLAMS on the brakes and turns

the car round, coming back. Then she jumps out of the car and

heads back in the diner, without looking over at STARKS.

EXT. DINER, SMALL TOWN VERMONT, SOME SECONDS LATER

She comes out -- this time PURSE in hand -- and sighs at

Starks.

STARKS nods slowly. The WAITRESS gets in her car and looks

again at STARKS in her REARVIEW MIRROR. He has hardly any

winter gear on him -- no gloves, no hat, no coat -- just jeans

and a flannel. He looks lost among his surroundings, as much

because he doesn't know where he is as because he doesn't

look like he belongs there.

She reverses towards him.

She looks him over and then rests her hands on the wheel.

Being cold and freezing are his options.

INT. WAITRESS' CAR

STARKS rubs his hand over his chin and cheek as he thinks it

over. She watches him curiously.

The WAITRESS takes out a FLASK and a sizable SWIG from it;

she swallows it smoothly, like someone used to doing so.

She looks over at him -- momentarily suspicious. He looks back

innocuously; there's something innately safe about him.

STARKS sees her take another DRINK from the flask. She pulls

out a CIGARETTE, and STARKS lights it for her with some

MATCHES.

She laughs, noticeably more relaxed now after the drink.

STARKS feels his pockets.

She casts a long sideward glance at STARKS, taking him and

her circumstances in for herself. He looks back gently.

INT. WAITRESS' APARTMENT, EVENING

She is on the PHONE, calling various shelters.   Her apartment

has some pieces of mismatched furniture, along   with a string

of lopsided CHRISTMAS LIGHTS strewn around the   WINDOWS in the

room. They, more than anything else, light the   place.

She hangs up the phone.

She leaves to the KITCHEN to fix herself a drink and STARKS

stares after her. Suddenly, a SMASHING SOUND is heard as

something falls in the kitchen. STARKS' whole BODY TENSES UP

as he wonders whether he's being taken out of the Jacket.

As she presumably cleans it up, we stay on STARKS who slowly

gains hold of himself. She comes back, DRINK in hand and

pushes the STRAND OF HAIR in her face back the same way she

did when he saw her in the tunnel. Even through her

weariness, she looks radiant under the Christmas lights. She

takes a long SIP.

And sadly, no plans for the evening anyway. She looks back --

her EYES even more tired from the liquor.

STARKS nods as she walks out.

EXT. YARD BEHIND WAITRESS' APARTMENT, EVENING

STARKS, still without a coat, collects some WOOD...

INT. KITCHEN, WAITRESS' APARTMENT, EVENING

STARKS looks in her fridge. There's not much to work with --

just some JARS and plenty of VODKA.

INT. LIVING ROOM, WAITRESS' APARTMENT, SOME TIME LATER

STARKS has lit a FIRE and set out a feeble dinner for them

when the WAITRESS comes out of the bedroom in sweats.

She looks and sees a SANDWICH on a BUN in one plate and a

SANDWICH on two different colors of TOAST on the other.

Then she looks over at the fire; it's obvious from the way

she looks at it that it's been years, if ever, since

someone's done something like this for her.

She turns and goes in the kitchen, calling out to him...

INT. KITCHEN, WAITRESS' APARTMENT, NIGHT

As she makes their DRINKS, a curious LOOK crosses her face,

just for a second.

INT. LIVING ROOM, WAITRESS' APARTMENT, A LITTLE WHILE LATER

They've sat down to eat under the blinking CHRISTMAS LIGHTS.

They eat quietly for a second. STARKS looks at her, then down

at his food, still subtly stunned by it all.

STARKS looks around as he decides to be honest with her.

She stares at him until a small sympathetic smile appears on

her lips.

STARKS smiles back uncertainly.

She holds up her glass somewhat sadly.

She goes to the KITCHEN, and STARKS clears their PLATES.

INT. LIVING ROOM, WAITRESS' APARTMENT

STARKS goes in the KITCHEN as she comes out with their

drinks. He hears her turn on the RADIO. She lands on an

OLDIES station that's playing "Girl of North Country" by Bob

Dylan.

INT. KITCHEN, WAITRESS' APARTMENT, NIGHT

STARKS smiles a little, then realizes he remembers, and

likes, the song. It's the first familiar thing for him in

days.

He walks out slowly to the living room, where the WAITRESS

sits on the couch, drinking. STARKS moves closer to the

radio, leaning into it, listening and forgetting, for a short

while -- only as long as a piece of song -- everything else.

STARKS listens close -- smiling a small, sad smile. Over the

HARMONICA, we pull back and see two very lonely people

passing time together the way people sometimes need to be

able to.

When STARKS looks at her then, he's so close to a meltdown

that it takes him a moment to fight his way out of it.

The CHRISTMAS LIGHTS flash drowsily to their own tempo.

INT. LIVING ROOM, WAITRESS' APARTMENT, AN HOUR OR SO LATER

She is visibly drained, after the day and the drinks.

The TEARS still run after all these years.

She is surprised that he gleaned the connection -- and that he'd

been listening so closely.

She closes her eyes and finally passes out. STARKS watches

her face, lit serenely by the FIRE and the Christmas lights.

It bears her grief even in sleep.

He covers her with a BLANKET then looks around and spots the

only PERSONAL EFFECTS in the room on her mantle. He walks

towards them, tripping slightly on a CORD from the LIGHTS. He

stumbles but regains his balance by reaching for the wall.

As he pulls himself up, he spots what is only inches away

from where his hand landed on the wall: HIS OWN DOG TAGS,

given to Jackie, only a couple weeks ago, hanging from a

single NAIL tacked into the wall.

Stunned, he stares at his NAME and BIRTH DATE scored on the

metal. He looks back at the WAITRESS and then to the few

PICTURES on the mantle: they are of JACKIE and her mother,

JEAN. STARKS runs his hand through his hair, trying to

swallow the improbability, and inexplicability, of the

situation.

STARKS' EYES search the room for ANYTHING that could help him

figure out what's happening. On the console is an OLD PAPER

and some MAIL. Totally disoriented, STARKS nearly STUMBLES on

his way to the PILE.

The label on the first BILL reads "Jackie Price." On the

second, the same. And the third...until at the bottom of the

pile, STARKS spots an OLD NEWSPAPER with the answer on its

DATE: December 3, 2004.

STARKS is absolutely stunned.

STARKS looks over at JACKIE and, just then, the HARSH SOUND

of the DRAWER being opened rings deafeningly in his ears and

the image of her starts to DISSOLVE at this worst moment. He

is being taken out of the JACKET...

INT. MORGUE, BASEMENT, ALPINE GROVE, LATE NIGHT

It's DR. GRIES, racked with guilt, who pulls Starks out...

He winces at the sight of the BLOOD and SWEAT streaked across

Starks' face. DR. GRIES checks his pulse and cleans his face

as best as he can with a WET TOWEL.

His VOICE echoes in the morgue, sounding to Starks, as it

does to us, faint and distant. DR. GRIES drips some WATER in

Starks' mouth. As some of it trickles out, it runs into the

JACKET, burning STARKS' chafed skin.

STARKS' EYES flutter and DR. GRIES pushes the drawer back in,

afraid of what they've done to this man...

INT. CADAVER DRAWER

STARKS clenches his face and pleadingly closes his eyes. FIVE

SECONDS OF TOTAL BLACKNESS and SILENCE and he's back in...

INT. LIVING ROOM, WAITRESS' (JACKIE'S) APARTMENT, NIGHT

Only now, he's kneeling beside her sleeping FACE, just

looking at it. STARKS doesn't know what's going on but her

serene, sleeping face steadies him. He can only call out the

name he thinks she might respond to...

Sure enough, she answers with a STIR in her sleep.

We see, in STARKS' eyes, the unbelievable connection: she is

the same little girl he met only a few weeks ago in 1992.

STARKS looks around as JACKIE moves in her sleep, almost

falling off the couch. STARKS picks her up and, in her sleep,

she WRAPS her arms around his neck.

INT. BEDROOM, JACKIE'S APARTMENT, NIGHT

STARKS tenderly lays her down on the bed...

INT. LIVING ROOM, JACKIE'S APARTMENT, NIGHT

STARKS picks up his DOG TAGS from the console, looks around,

spots the TELEVISION and fumbles a bit as he figures out how

to turn it on. STARKS sits down, throws back the rest of

JACKIE'S DRINK and another shot and looks around nervously,

unable to explain what's happening to him...

INT. BEDROOM, JACKIE'S APARTMENT, CHRISTMAS MORNING

JACKIE sits in her sleep as she wakes up, clearly hung over.

INT. BATHROOM, JACKIE'S APARTMENT, CHRISTMAS MORNING

As JACKIE closes the MEDICINE CABINET, she sees her hungover

reflection in it.

She puts her face under the WATER and lets it restore some

color and life in her. As she comes up, that's when she

remembers the night before and the voice she barely heard in

her sleep.

She SHOOTS UP from the sink, staring at her reflection.

INT. LIVING ROOM, JACKIE'S APARTMENT, SECONDS LATER

JACKIE spots STARKS asleep on the couch -- newspaper strewn

all around him and the TV still on. He's holding the TAGS.

She kneels down close to his face and stares at him for

awhile before STARKS is jarred. He defensively GRABS HER

WRIST as his EYES BURST OPEN, startling her.

STARKS lets his GRIP loosen.

A short look of SHOCK cross her face before she leaps up.

JACKIE grabs the nearest object -- the IRON FORK from the

FIREPLACE set -- and holds it, shaking, against STARKS. STARKS

stays calm; he hardly expected a different reaction.

JACKIE covers her ears and looks at him, pleading with her

eyes. STARKS' eyes plead right back.

Then he remembers -- understanding with a chill that what she

is saying could entirely be true.

STARKS falters under the news. JACKIE looks around, through

her now blurred eyes, like she might find some help in the

apartment. She settles for the BOTTLE of VODKA on the table,

lowers the iron fork and takes a long heavy drink, then

laughs nervously as she looks up.

STARKS looks at her tenderly before he turns to leave.

JACKIE, a little calmer, looks at the door like he's still on

the other side of it and calls out softly, and sadly...

INT. JACKET/TUNNEL PASSAGE

STARKS looks around him and, we see, from bottom up, the

exterior around Jackie's house melt away as STARKS suddenly

faces the massacred village in Iraq. Shocked at what's

happening to his body, he looks up, petrified. His body is

wound as tightly as a knot.

EXT. IRAQI VILLAGE, NIGHT, 1991

Again, we're glimpsing the scene through PHOSPHORESCENT GREEN

NIGHT VISION intermittently negotiated with real-time images.

Opposite Starks stands a CRAZED IRAQI SOLDIER -- seething in

anger and pointing his gun at a LITTLE BOY, presumably

belonging to the MAN not five feet away. Next to Starks is an

angry CAPTAIN MEDLEY, ordering STARKS to follow him. STARKS

is watching himself in the scene.

STARKS turns and aims his gun at a CRAZED IRAQI SOLDIER

threatening to shoot a child. We hear him YELLING in Arabic.

What STARKS doesn't see is another IRAQI SOLDIER (2) aiming

his GUN at STARKS.

STARKS doesn't hear him; he's busy perfecting his aim.

At the force of the word, the SOLDIER lowers his gun and the

LITTLE BOY flees.

STARKS, who is now in the scene himself, lowers his gun

slightly as he approaches the SOLDIER. Neither speaks the

other's language but they're both saying everything with

their eyes. Neither moves his off the other.

Just then, though, we see the SECOND IRAQI SOLDIER get a

clear aim at STARKS.

He takes his SHOT before anyone else does. STARKS goes down

as the skin off the side of his head is shaved off.

He falls to the ground. As the rest of the picture fades to

black, all that is left is previously mysterious, still

haunting PAIR of EYES that we now see belonged to the

CRAZED IRAQI SOLDIER.

And over it all is the now more distant CLANK OF METAL as the

drawer is opened and the nightmare momentarily ended...

INT. MORGUE, ALPINE GROVE, CHRISTMAS DAY

DR. GRIES, DR. BECKER, DAMON and NURSE HARDING enter the

room.

Nothing is Gries' answer. Still, Becker seems to share the

concern.

BECKER motions for them to open the drawer. They pull him

out. STARKS looks cold and wrecked.

BECKER feels for a pulse and seems surprised to find one.

INT. WARD, ALPINE GROVE, CHRISTMAS DAY

DR. LORENSON walks into the ward to check on STARKS. The

attending NURSE is walking around the ward.

INT. HALLWAY, ALPINE GROVE, DAY

DR. LORENSON walks anxiously down the halls of the hospital,

peering into every room, looking for Starks.

INT. ANOTHER HALLWAY, ALPINE GROVE, DAY

DR. LORENSON spots BECKER walking out the DOORS of the

hospital and RUNS after him, in only his white coat...

EXT. PARKING LOT, ALPINE GROVE, DAY (CONT'D)

DR. BECKER stops walking and waits a moment, registering the

voice, before he turns around to face Dr. Lorenson.

BECKER ignores Lorenson's insinuation and merely turns his

CHEEK all the way round towards Lorenson so he can see the

BANDAGE from the CUT Starks gave him.

LORENSON looks at BECKER; he knows he's hiding something.

LORENSON looks back, starting to grasp Becker's misshapen

beliefs.

INT. ROOM, INTENSIVE CARE UNIT, ALPINE GROVE, CHRISTMAS DAY

STARKS, IV in arm, lies asleep in bed, recovering...

INT. HOSPITAL, VERMONT

JACKIE walks in a hospital -- with many aspects parallel to

the mental hospital. White on white and, for Jackie

particularly, the presence of painful memories.

INT. ROOM, INTENSIVE CARE UNIT, ALPINE GROVE, CHRISTMAS DAY

LORENSON walks closer to STARKS and carefully examines the

BRUISES and BURNS on a body that's been badly beaten. His

eyes bear his guilt.

INT. NURSE'S STATION, HOSPITAL, VERMONT

JACKIE waits until a nurse, CLAIRE, greets her perfunctorily.

CLAIRE looks up, astonished to see her. She smiles warmly.

INT. STARKS' HOSPITAL ROOM

STARKS is asleep when a DARK FIGURE walks, like a GHOST, past

the WINDOWED DOOR of his room. STARKS opens his eyes and

snaps his neck in its direction -- fearful of everything at

this point. When he looks, there's nothing there; he's not

sure there ever was. The room starts to blue as he looks

around it, not knowing if he is crazy...

INT. OFFICE, HOSPITAL, VERMONT

JACKIE peruses HEADLINES and ABSTRACTS pulled up on the web:

The words and PHRASES that confirm Starks' story RISE from

their couched places on the computer screen.

As JACKIE keeps scrolling, her face wears her disbelief that

what STARKS was saying may have been true. Then, she sees,

archived in a state newspaper, a mention of Dr. Lorenson and

a particular patient, "Eugene Yazdi."

INT. STARKS' HOSPITAL ROOM, DECEMBER 26TH

A NURSE is checking on STARKS as he slowly wakes up.

STARKS is asking the NURSE, but it's BECKER's voice that

answers though Starks can't see him.

STARKS panics when he hears the voice. He looks around

nervously but the BRIGHT SUNLIGHT pouring into the room is

blinding. He swallows as he looks at the NURSE'S FACE as she

continues adjusting his pillows.

The NURSE shakes her head lightly and just then BECKER steps

out of the LIGHT.

Becker is remarkably calm, further confusing Starks' sense of

reality.

STARKS sits up groggily, remembering what happened to him and

wondering how much, if any of it, was real.

STARKS examines himself -- looking at his arms, spotting the

BRUISES on them.

BECKER nods. STARKS sits up -- his predicament and the room

slowly coming into focus.

STARKS begins to piece if together. BECKER, as we begin to

see, is right. It is 1992 in Alpine Grove.

The NURSE gives Becker a knowing look -- suggesting Starks

really is delusional. Becker doesn't even flinch as STARKS

tries to get a better look at Becker's face.

STARKS' EYES widen with alarm as BECKER reaches for the I.V.

in his arm, lingering on it long enough that Starks braces

himself for an ATTACK of some sort. But Becker just looks

back innocently as he adjusts it.

Then he clarifies, wryly enough for Starks to catch it.

BECKER nods diagnostically. The NURSE's nonchalance about it

as she LEAVES the room further disquiets STARKS.

BECKER sits down in a CHAIR, half-shrouded in the light.

STARKS squints as he searches out Becker's face.

BECKER leans into Starks' view to make sure he's listening.

STARKS is.

BECKER's expression bears a hunting mixture of anger and

remorse as he recounts Ted's tale.

BECKER gets up and, as he moves out of the light, STARKS sees

his BANDAGED CHEEK, reinforcing his memory of what

happened...

INT. STARKS' ROOM, RECOVERY WARD, ALPINE GROVE, DAY, 1992

STARKS looks out on the SNOW-COVERED GROUNDS from his room on

the third floor. He seems pacified for the moment.

INT. HALLWAY, RECOVERY WARD, ALPINE GROVE, DAY

Everything about the dingy hospital punctuates the sad

mechanics of managing madness. CATATONIC PATIENTS and dated

equipment litter the hall and, as we follow a NURSE who walks

among them, we spot STARKS -- ARMS suspended in air and GLAZED

EYES fixed on the ceiling -- pretending to be one of them.

His ARMS fall and he wipes his dried MOUTH as soon as she

passes. STARKS has successfully made it out of his room. She

turns one corner as STARKS hustles to turn another...

INT. DAY ROOM, ALPINE GROVE

STARKS is almost   there. As RANDOM ORDERLIES pass him, STARKS

lets his posture   collapse as he despondently hangs his head

down so low they   can't see his face. They pass, and STARKS

starts scuttling   towards the door to the outside.

As soon as he reaches it and is outside in the cold -- with

only his BLUE PATIENT UNIFORM -- Starks walks normally, like

he no longer remembers the risks. Instead he remembers what

Jackie told him.

EXT. GROUNDS, ALPINE GROVE

STARKS leans down -- seemingly oblivious to the cold -- and

lifts some snow to his mouth, TASTING it like a man who needs

to affirm he is still alive. He's so rapt that LORENSON's

VOICE takes him by surprise.

STARKS stiffens as he realizes he could be in the place where

his body was found. The terrible question asks itself on his

face: Is this when Starks is killed?

As LORENSON reaches into his POCKET for something, STARKS

anxiously holds his breath. It's BLACK when it comes out and...

a SKI HAT when it opens up. STARKS lets out his breath,

relieved.

STARKS is surprised by Lorenson's agreement.

LORENSON seems to realize -- at least for an instant -- that he

is looking at a desperate man who is persuasively, and

cogently, staring back at him.

STARKS still doesn't know how much Lorenson knows, and if he

should trust him.

LORENSON answers first with his eyes looking over Starks'

body. STARKS merely stares back tersely.

LORENSON -- sensing she's not going to get any more from

Starks -- turns around to go back inside. It's only as she

turns her face away from STARKS that we see how nervous she

is. But you'd never guess it from her tone...

STARKS looks towards the FENCES locking him in from every

direction. LORENSON waits until she hears STARKS' FOOTSTEPS

following her. She waits until STARKS has reached her.

INT. PATIENT CAFETERIA, WARD, ALPINE GROVE, 1992

STARKS and MACKENZIE are eating opposite each other.

MACKENZIE clams up slightly at the mention of it...

MACKENZIE's eyes start to twitch nervously.

MACKENZIE grows visibly more nervous at this second mention

of it.

Just then, NURSE HARDING is upon them. She carries a ROD in

her hand which she TAPS menacingly on the floor as she walks

towards them.

STARKS tenses up as he sees only the ROD, which could inflict

a GASH if hit across a man's head the right way. Nearly every

object could be a threat to his life as this point.

STARKS is startled MacKenzie gets it.

MACKENZIE tries not to laugh but a CHUCKLE slips out.

HARDING walks away with a final stare that Starks returns.

MACKENZIE's body betrays his discomfort talking about it in

its sudden jerks accompanying every word.

INT. HALLWAY, ALPINE GROVE, 1992, DAY

Dr. LORENSON and DR. GRIES are walking briskly to a meeting.

LORENSON looks at GRIES askance before she sets the record

straight.

LORENSON can see GRIES is trying to tell her something.

LORENSON grabs GRIES' arm, sensing the import of her words.

INT. WARD 3, ALPINE GROVE, 1992, DAY

STARKS is in a different ward with PATIENTS who appear more

threatening and disturbed. As he is anxiously looking around --

presumably for a way out -- Starks hears one of the PATIENTS

humming an eerily DISCORDANT MELODY. Looking to see who it

comes from, STARKS happens to spot ONE PATIENT -- a young,

fierce-looking guy -- eyeing a YOUNG NURSE, SALLY,

administering medication from a dated CART.

STARKS looks around the room and notes there are NO DOCTORS

or ORDERLIES around. The YOUNG NURSE, meanwhile, is focused

on the medicine -- oblivious to the BRUTE eyeing her.

The BRUTE's not that far away when he starts walking towards

the YOUNG NURSE. STARKS starts in their direction, picking up

speed -- maneuvering through VARIOUS INCOHERENT PATIENTS -- as

the BRUTE reaches the NURSE.

He throws her TRAY down and pushes her against the WALL. She

starts screaming as he pushes up against her. STARKS picks up

the TRAY and strikes the BRUTE across the head with it.

The BRUTE holds his head in pain as he tries to regain his

balance. It's clear he's impaired. But it's also clear he

understands pain.

As she NODS, her EYES dart above to the HAND about to strike

him. Off her look, he ducks and turns around, punching the

BRUTE in the stomach -- HARD -- but not before the piece of GLASS

he held from one of the broken MEDICINE BOTTLES comes

perilously close to STARKS' head.

The BRUTE bowls over and STARKS looks at the GLASS terrified.

Is this when he dies?

The BRUTE -- incensed more than ever -- lunges at him a final time.

STARKS gets him by the NECK, expertly applying PRESSURE

POINTS and, after only a few seconds, subdues him. STARKS

himself seems surprised that he knew how to use them. He lets

out a suspended BREATH, instinctively touching his FOREHEAD

to make sure he's not cut. He looks back at SALLY.

SALLY looks at STARKS, wondering whether she can trust him.

Her eyes shift to the BRUTE on the floor and she remembers

that she can.

INT. MAIN ROOM, WARD, ALPINE GROVE, DAY, 1992

The STATE REP -- 40s, disgruntled, even drowsy -- is

recognizable among a group that includes the CHIEF OF STAFF

(Dr. Williams), BECKER, LORENSON and GRIES. They are

presiding over a GROUP THERAPY SESSION when STARKS enters...

BECKER is noticeably taken aback but tempers his response.

STARKS cuts him off and threatens with his gaze.

BECKER relents, seeing STARKS has the upper hand -- an

AUDIENCE, deranged but eager no less.

As STARKS walks across the room, it's obvious to everyone -- as

they turn their heads to watch him -- that he is a physically

ailing man. Using all his strength, he walks up slowly to the

group, dragging a CHAIR behind him because he doesn't have

the strength to lift it. STARKS sits down.

JENSEN -- a twitchy schizophrenic -- surveys the group

seriously, determining whether it's safe to say what he's

about to...

BECKER's not listening to a word JENSEN says. But STARKS is.

The other PATIENTS look at him in wonder as the STATE REP

listens limply.

The GROUP stares at one another silently.

STARKS looks at JENSEN, who looks back avidly. MACKENZIE eyes

Starks nervously, like he senses what he is about to do.

LORENSON and MACKENZIE watch STARKS curiously.

Not even the DOCTORS dare disrupt the silence...

JENSEN looks on nobly.

STARKS suddenly turns right at Becker, wrapping his message

to him in the seemingly crazed theatrics of a nut.

STARKS stands up, ready to SALUTE Mr. Jensen. The OBSERVERS

look to BECKER for order.

But, at that, Jensen's completely lost it. His excitement

erupts in the form of him JUMPING out of his chair and

eagerly and elatedly HITTING HIMSELF in the head.

Too late. OTHER PATIENTS are on their feet, HANDS jubilantly

up in the air. And, in the midst of the havoc, the speechless

order is soundly delivered in Becker's NOD to Damon.

DAMON and HARDING grab STARKS while the other members of the

STAFF slowly calm the other patients. LORENSON is too busy to

notice them taking Starks out. STARKS winks at MACKENZIE, who

smiles somewhat sadly back.

INT. MORGUE, BASEMENT, ALPINE GROVE, LATE NIGHT, 1992

HARDING and DAMON stand above Starks, who lies on the brutal

slab, already hemmed in the Jacket.

DAMON slams him in the drawer.

INT. JACKET/TUNNEL PASSAGE

STARKS' eyes dart about him; it sounds like something is in

there with him. The sound stops momentarily and, then, out of

nowhere, a DROP falls on his eye. PING! STARKS winces. He

clenches his face, not knowing when the next drop will fall.

His heart starts to beat more and more madly, punctuated by

the DRIPS -- making a score fit only for hell. He closes his

eyes and begins to die...

EXT. CRIME SCENE, HIGHWAY, VERMONT, DUSK, 1992

STARKS and TENNY -- 30s, shifty, a total stranger -- sit in

silence in TENNY'S CAR. (We recognize the murder scene.) RED

POLICE LIGHTS FLASH in the rearview mirror though STARKS

doesn't see them yet.

STARKS and TENNY are talking to one another. TENNY's voice

takes a dangerous tone.

TENNY nods, distracting STARKS long enough to slip a hand

down his leg to the GUN he's hidden there.

TENNY carefully pulls over to the side of the road, assured

and cautious with each word, each move.

OFFICER HARRISON walks up to their car.

That's the second when OFFICER HARRISON sees where TENNY'S

HAND is. As he reaches for his own GUN, the situation

explodes as TWO FLASHES eclipse all else. OFFICER HARRISON

goes down, still holding his own GUN and STARKS jumps out of

the car to check on him.

TENNY looks around, still holding the GUN. Starks swallows,

assessing whether to back away or not. TENNY waves his gun as

he half points it in Harrison's direction. Then, GUN still in

hand, he smirks nervously and looks at STARKS.

TENNY raises the gun, then aims it away from STARKS and

shoots OFFICER HARRISON once more. From the ground, OFFICER

HARRISON fires back and STARKS, now lunging at Tenny, TAKES

THE HIT.

STARKS falls, clearly unable to get up, let alone pursue

anyone. TENNY smiles sardonically and slowly puts the GUN in

his back pocket as he turns to leave. This SMILE was one of

the eerie FLASHES that haunted Starks in the JACKET...

STARKS struggles but can't move. That's when he passes out,

looking at OFFICER HARRISON from the ground, as he did in the

scene before.

INT. JACKET/TUNNEL PASSAGE

STARKS stands in the lighted tunnel, which only gets brighter

as his heart races with fear in the first seconds that he's

back in there. Then he sees an IMAGE of a WOMAN'S FOREHEAD

that lulls him to a calm until his heart slows and the LIGHT

gradually dims...

INT. DINER, SMALL TOWN VERMONT, 2004

STARKS enters the diner, calming down even more as he spots

JACKIE. She looks up, holding PLATES in her hand. She's

understandably surprised and unexpectedly pleased when she

sees him. She greets him with a small smile.

She drops off her orders and then walks up to him.

EXT. RAVINE, VERMONT, DAY, 2004

STARKS and JACKIE smoke in the cold, standing next to the

hood of her car.

JACKIE nods.

JACKIE nods.

JACKIE looks around her; coupled with the cold, her sobriety

is obvious. STARKS takes hold of her and holds her face close

to his so that their foreheads touch.

JACKIE looks at him and laughs.

INT. JACKIE'S CAR, 2004, DAY

They are driving through VERMONT to ALPINE GROVE. STARKS

looks out the window and watches her drive.

INT. ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE, ALPINE GROVE, 2004

STARKS and JACKIE sit opposite DR. MORGAN, the current young

face of the hospital. MORGAN has a boyish face and a matching

gullibility.

STARKS doesn't waver when he answers.

INT. WARD, ALPINE GROVE, DAY, 2004

Dr. MORGAN leads JACKIE and STARKS through a ward. STARKS

looks around in disbelief; it's more like a hospital now than

it ever was in 1993.

INT. RECEPTION AREA, LORENSON'S OFFICE, ALPINE GROVE, 2004

As they arrive outside Lorenson's office, MORGAN turns to

them.

DR. MORGAN goes inside and JACKIE takes STARKS' HAND as they

wait. It's hardly more than a couple seconds when LORENSON

appears in the doorway. She looks at STARKS curiously and the

two share a very lengthy, intense STARE.

DR. LORENSON -- now in her 50s -- walks closer to Starks

suspiciously. For his part, STARKS doesn't look as unfamiliar

with Lorenson as he should; this doesn't escape Lorenson.

She puts out a hand that is trembling slightly.

STARKS hesitates before he takes Lorenson's hand. There is

something very eerie about the exchange. STARKS quickly lets

go and LORENSON turns to JACKIE...

JACKIE looks back uncomfortably.

LORENSON looks over both of them acutely and then calmly

turns to Dr. Morgan.

INT. LORENSON'S OFFICE, ALPINE GROVE, 2004

LORENSON leans against her desk while STARKS and JACKIE sit

in the chairs. As they talk, each seems cautious in his

exchange -- not knowing what the other one does or doesn't

know.

LORENSON considers her answer.

LORENSON waits to see if STARKS knows what she is talking

about.

STARKS shows no recognition but JACKIE does.

LORENSON says it like she's hiding something.

LORENSON looks like she's suddenly remembering something.

STARKS looks at Lorenson curiously; he doesn't know what

Lorenson is talking about.

STARKS just stares at LORENSON, not knowing if he died by

this man's hands or not, not knowing who he can trust...

DR. LORENSON looks right at STARKS.

INT. HALLWAY, ALPINE GROVE, DAY

STARKS and JACKIE walk briskly down it, away from Lorenson's

office.

STARKS nods.

INT. CORRIDOR [LEADING TO BASEMENT], ALPINE GROVE, 2004

STARKS, determined, now leads JACKIE. As they reach the end

of the hall, we see DAMON -- now in his 50s -- look after them

curiously before he goes back to his work with a PATIENT.

INT. BASEMENT, ALPINE GROVE, 2004

JACKIE watches STARKS ignore the "Authorized Personnel Only"

SIGN as he pushes the door open without so much as a pause.

INT. MORGUE, BASEMENT, ALPINE GROVE, 2004

The morgue looks exactly as before.

STARKS is momentarily jarred in the room. He looks to the

wall on which the JACKET hung and sees only the BARE HOOKS

that used to hold it up.

JACKIE isn't doubtful, but it's also hard to be

convinced...

STARKS walks to the CADAVER DRAWERS and rests his hands on

the one they put him in. Then, with great difficulty --

physical and emotional -- he opens it to see if there is

anything left.

He pulls it out, and there's nothing in there.

STARKS leans closer, locating all the proof he needs: the

stained metal -- still reddened and browned with DRIED BLOOD --

and the part of the morgue slab he CLAWED his NAILS into when

he was in it. JACKIE looks at it in disbelief.

INT. HALLWAY, BASEMENT, ALPINE GROVE

STARKS and JACKIE are leaving the MORGUE, when STARKS spots

DAMON, now hardly a hair of the bully he was before. DAMON

stares at him curiously; STARKS glares back furiously.

DAMON doesn't take his eyes off Starks.

DAMON smiles, remembering...

STARKS looms strangely over DAMON in this exchange.

Damon's eyes betray his unease.

DAMON is shocked, and cowed. So much that he shakes as he

looks for his bearings.

STARKS starts to see a shaking man who stands confused and

distraught before him.

Damon's eyes are filled with dishonesty, tears and a craven

FEAR. STARKS leans in closer to DAMON as he remembers...

STARKS looks like he could easily bash Damon's head against

the wall, but instead he lets it go and walks away.

EXT. CEMETERY, ALPINE GROVE GROUNDS, 2004, DAY

STARKS is standing above his own headstone: WILLIAM STARKS,

December 25, 1967 - January 1, 1993. Next to his grave is that

of RUDY MACKENZIE. STARKS looks down sadly at both. JACKIE

comes up behind him.

STARKS looks scared and lost -- like it's all catching up to

him. And like he might be being taken out of the Jacket.

PAGE MISSING

JACKIE kisses his SCARS -- from the war and the Jacket -- and

STARKS lifts her higher so he can look at her as they make

love for the first time.

INT. BEDROOM, JACKIE'S APARTMENT, NIGHT

JACKIE is lying in STARKS' arms, running her FINGERS over one

of the SCARS on his chest. STARKS strokes her hair.

She doesn't finish because it's too hard to. STARKS nods,

wiping her tears and kissing her.

INT. BEDROOM, JACKIE'S APARTMENT, NIGHT, 2004

The sore sound of the DRAWER being opened stirs Jackie --

awakening her as if she heard it in her sleep. She reaches

across the bed, but STARKS is no longer there. She runs her

hands over the bed like he's alive in the sheets.

INT. HALLWAY, ALPINE GROVE, NIGHT, 1992

DR. LORENSON is administering medicine to a patient in the

ward, when she sees -- almost like a shadow -- a STRETCHER

being wheeled down the hall. She finishes with the patient

and runs to the end of the hall in search of it...

INT. STARKS' ROOM, ICU, ALPINE GROVE, LATE NIGHT, 1992

STARKS lies recovering under a small light above his hospital

bed. His body bears marks of the brutalization. As we pull

back, we see DR. LORENSON standing guard over him at the foot

of his bed.

EXT. WARD, ICU, ALPINE GROVE, NEXT MORNING

STARKS sits by a window -- I.V.'s in his arm -- smoking feebly,

still severely weak from the Jacket, while DR. LORENSON

observes him for a bit from the hall before she goes inside.

LORENSON pulls up a chair and sits opposite him.

STARKS waits to see what this means.

LORENSON doesn't understand.

LORENSON just thinks it's another delusion.

STARKS searches for words that won't sound as crazy as he

knows he appears. They don't exist.

STARKS fixes his eyes on Lorenson. He has nothing to lose but

still he treads carefully. The words that follow come almost

unwittingly.

It's as though STARKS hears his words for the first time.

LORENSON nods, trying to mask his dismay but failing.

LORENSON looks at STARKS, unintentionally patronizing.

STARKS shakes his head and momentarily challenges Lorenson

simply with his air of calm resolve.

LORENSON searches for another approach.

STARKS nods.

STARKS moves to put his cigarette out and his I.V. almost

falls out of his arm. LORENSON makes a move to adjust it and

STARKS flinches perceptibly, startling LORENSON.

Then, STARKS remembers the only thing that might help him. He

pauses, trying to recall as much of it as he can.

LORENSON -- having prepared to continue -- is bowled over at

the mention of her patient. She loses all color and calm in

her features.

LORENSON doesn't know what to say.

STARKS looks at her convincingly.

LORENSON backs off, jarred by Starks' assertions and fearful

of his debilitating vehemence.

INT. HALLWAY, ALPINE GROVE, DAY, 1992

MACKENZIE sits idly on one of the hallway benches until the

hallway is clear of the STAFF. Then he scuttles quickly -- all

the time close to the wall -- to Starks' room.

INT. STARKS' ROOM, ALPINE GROVE, DAY, 1992

MACKENZIE gets inside, ducks as a NURSE passes and then taps

lightly on the wall, announcing himself gladly.

STARKS doesn't waste any time.

MACKENZIE almost imperceptibly winces -- confirming the truth

for Starks -- before he has to sit down.

MACKENZIE tosses him the CIGARETTES and lights himself one.

MACKENZIE suddenly stops, distraught. When he resumes, it's

in an oddly more normal tone than he's ever used before.

STARKS doesn't have an answer.

As MacKenzie runs his hand over his forehead, he looks hurt,

and sad, but strangely not a bit crazy.

MACKENZIE's twitching continues as he recollects it.

STARKS nods and MacKenzie puts his head down, suddenly

vulnerable and embarrassed. STARKS lights TWO CIGARETTES.

MACKENZIE and STARKS smoke together quietly.

INT. STARKS' ROOM, ALPINE GROVE, DECEMBER 29th, 1992

STARKS is trying to see if the windows open through the bars

covering them. It's especially hard with the I.V. still

connected to one of his arms.

STARKS turns, startled.

STARKS lights a cigarette and, with that gesture, adopts the

unscrupulousness of a criminal so convincingly it bears

little resemblance to his usual demeanor.

BECKER looks at STARKS seriously.

STARKS simply delivers one slow nod.

BECKER looks understandably disgusted and STARKS proceeds

with the calculation of someone who is guilty.

It takes BECKER some seconds to swallow this.

BECKER cocks his head to one side as he does. Then he slowly

makes his way over to STARKS and leans in closer to him.

STARKS instinctively raises his hand to his HEAD -- prepared

to be defensive if he has to be. If this is the moment when

he's killed.

But BECKER only YANKS the I.V. angrily out of Starks' arm,

tearing his skin with it.

BECKER turns to leave as STARKS bleeds onto the floor.

STARKS smirks at the hypocrisy he sees.

BECKER leaves without looking back and STARKS closes his

eyes, breathing a sigh of relief that it's over.

INT. NURSE STATION, ALPINE GROVE, 1992, EVENING

LORENSON, dressed to leave, stops to talk to NINA, one of the

evening nurses.

INT. LORENSON'S HOME, VERMONT, 1992

LORENSON comes home to an unremarkable apartment to find a

thin, young mother, TALIA YAZDI, and her eleven year-old

mute, and seemingly retarded son, EUGENE, waiting for her

outside her door.

EUGENE returns her greeting with a blank stare.

INT. LORENSON'S HOME, VERMONT, SOME TIME LATER

LORENSON sets her things down on the kitchen table as TALIA

starts to tidy things around the apartment.

TALIA looks at LORENSON.

LORENSON nods. She believes her.

INT. STARKS' ROOM, ALPINE GROVE, NIGHT, 1992

STARKS spots DAMON standing cautiously in the hall.

INT. NURSE STATION, ALPINE GROVE, NIGHT, 1992

We see (but don't hear) HARDING speak to NINA as DAMON slips

into STARKS' ROOM. NINA seems sufficiently distracted.

INT. STARKS' ROOM, SECONDS LATER

DAMON flashes a KNIFE at STARKS.

One look at the KNIFE and the SAME QUESTION burns once more...

INT. HALLWAY, ALPINE GROVE, NIGHT, 1992

DAMON hustles Starks down the hall as fast as they can before

the NURSE or any other staff member spots them.

INT. OFFICE/LIBRARY, LORENSON'S HOME, NIGHT

EUGENE sits opposite LORENSON, who quietly observes him,

jotting some notes down on her pad. She is intermittently

holding up PICTURES for Eugene, asking him to repeat their

names as if she were teaching him to read.

EUGENE starts to pronounce the word when abruptly, and

without any warning, he looks like he's unconscious, only

with a blank stare. Lorenson quickly moves beside Eugene and

watches him from up close, apparently not altogether

surprised at what's happening.

EUGENE doesn't even blink. The only sounds we hear from him

are a couple, barely audible guttural noises. LORENSON --

exhausted -- takes off her glasses wearily and gently

addresses the boy.

Just then, TALIA walks in with TEA, JUICE and COOKIES for

Eugene and Lorenson. She spots her son in his absent, staring

state and forces her face into a small, sad smile to avoid

tears as she sets the tray down and the cookies before them.

TALIA gently touches LORENSON'S hand. LORENSON looks at her

warmly. TALIA knows how hard she's trying.

INT. MORGUE, BASEMENT, ALPINE GROVE, NIGHT, 1992

BECKER soundlessly watches as HARDING and DAMON finish

strapping Starks in the Jacket.

DAMON slams the DRAWER shut, sending STARKS back in.

INT. JACKET/TUNNEL

What STARKS lacks in strength, he counteracts with his

OVERWHELMING WILL. The SCREEN TREMBLES with it. One TERRIFIC,

WHITE LIGHT and we...

INT. JACKIE'S CAR, SHELBOURNE, VERMONT, 2004, DAY

STARKS sits by himself in Jackie's car, parked in a gas

station. He looks around, trying to make sure it really is

her car. He looks in the back and sees a pair of sneakers and

an empty BOTTLE of VODKA.

He looks outside and sees a few people walking into the FOOD

MART of the gas station. He trembles with cold as he looks

down at his plaid shirt.

Then, JACKIE unexpectedly appears outside the DRIVER'S WINDOW

opening the car door and nearly spilling her COFFEE when she

spots STARKS next to her.

Seeing it's him though, she smiles warmly.

She leans over to him and gives him a kiss, handing him the

coffee.

EXT. MAIN STREET, SHELBOURNE, VERMONT, 2004

JACKIE speeds through the streets of Shelbourne, presumably

on their way to Becker's house.

EXT. BECKER'S NEIGHBORHOOD, SHELBOURNE, VERMONT, 2004

They've slowed down a little.

INT. JACKIE'S CAR, 2004, DAY

JACKIE reads from some directions on a PAPER as their CAR

slows down on one particular street, towards one particular

house.

EXT. BECKER'S HOUSE, SHELBOURNE, 2004, DAY

INT. JACKIE'S CAR, 2004, DAY

STARKS looks at the house, bedecked with a lopsided SNOW MAN

on the front lawn.

STARKS gets out of the car.

EXT. BECKER'S HOUSE, SHELBOURNE, 2004, DAY

STARKS knocks on the door. No answer.

EXT. BECKER'S HOUSE, SHELBOURNE, 2004, DAY

JACKIE tries to look through the windows to see if anyone's

there. No one is. It looks small and dark inside.

EXT. BECKER'S HOUSE, SHELBOURNE, 2004, DAY

STARKS knocks again, looking down anxiously at his feet.

JACKIE walks up to him from around the side of the house.

They don't have the time to wait.

JACKIE notices how COLD Starks looks.

STARKS nods.

INT. JACKIE'S CAR, 2004, DAY

STARKS rubs his hands together as he looks out the windows

and sees NO CARS or PEOPLE on the street. JACKIE watches him

despairingly.

JACKIE looks around; there really aren't.

STARKS turns to JACKIE, thinking.

STARKS runs his hand over his head and closes his eyes in

desperation.

STARKS doesn't answer.

STARKS opens his eyes. She sighs in relief.

STARKS starts to shake his head in disbelief, when suddenly,

he realizes...

STARKS looks ecstatic with hope.

A small, beautiful, removed place.

EXT. STREETS, SHELBOURNE

JACKIE and STARKS head back to the only MAIN STREET in the

town. As they approach the town church, they start to see a

ROW of cars parallel-parked on the street.

JACKIE pulls up to the entrance of the CHURCH.

INT. JACKIE'S CAR, 2004, DAY

STARKS watches JACKIE get out of the car and walk up to the

doors of the CHURCH.

EXT. CHURCH, SHELBOURNE, 2004

JACKIE boldly opens the CHURCH door.

INT. CHURCH, SHELBOURNE, 2004

JACKIE sees the town seated in the Church. The PRIEST looks

up at her briefly and some people turn around, but she closes

the DOOR before she causes a major interruption.

INT. CHURCH, SHELBOURNE, 2004

We move to the third or fourth row, where, from behind, we

see a head of GREY HAIR. He slowly turns around, casting a

look towards the door and revealing a glimpse of his face.

Though it's aged slightly, it hasn't softened.

EXT. CHURCH, SHELBOURNE, 2004

JACKIE and STARKS watch as the people file out of Church.

They are leaning against her car when STARKS spots him.

DR. BECKER walks beside a SMALL CHILD -- presumably his

GRANDSON. JACKIE registers his formidableness with some

surprise; Becker's maintained a strong physique and is hardly

a shade less intimidating than he was before. Only his hand

has a permanent shake now.

STARKS doesn't waste any time. He heads straight for him.

Almost sensing him, BECKER looks in his direction. The casual

look on his face is instantly supplanted by one of DISBELIEF.

BECKER stops walking and looks at Starks. His GRANDSON looks

at him.

His grandson, momentarily appeased, heads for the car.

That's enough to confirm for BECKER who STARKS is.

All around them, people leaving Church socialize routinely --

unaware of the haunted history being made between them.

STARKS looks at Becker -- each a terrifying reminder of the

other's past.

BECKER looks at him, nearly too stunned to speak.

BECKER falters as he recalls his offenses.

BECKER concedes after all this time.

STARKS is quiet as he comes to understand how it's about to

work out: if Becker tells him those names now, he essentially

indicts himself.

BECKER remembers with a hint of remorse.

STARKS looks at Becker, in astonishment.

STARKS just stares at Becker, waiting for the realization to

hit him, too.

STARKS shares a last look with Becker before he walks away

towards the car.

INT. JACKIE'S CAR, DAY, 2004

JACKIE and STARKS sit inside the parked car as STARKS touches

his head.

And with those words, JACKIE starts to break down.

STARKS takes her hand and runs it over his head.

STARKS looks at her with love, understanding and, for the

first time, a sense of peace. He strokes her hair to calm her

down.

STARKS looks at her without answering. JACKIE wipes her eyes,

fastens STARKS' seat belt, and seeing that Starks' EYES have

started to flutter, starts driving. In the distance, the

barely audible sound of the DRAWER opening, and their time

ending, is heard.

EXT. HIGHWAY, VERMONT, DAY, 2004

JACKIE and STARKS speed on the highway. As STARKS sleeps,

JACKIE keeps looking over at him like it's a way to make sure

he stays with her.

INT. HOSPITAL, VERMONT, DAY, 2004

JACKIE helps STARKS -- who's severely weakened at this point --

to the nurse's station. CLAIRE is there.

CLAIRE helps JACKIE, and they take him into a room. From

afar, we hear CLAIRE asking about him.

INT. ROOM, HOSPITAL, VERMONT, DAY, 2004

JACKIE helps CLAIRE do for STARKS what they can; it doesn't

seem like much at this point.

INT. OFFICE, HOSPITAL, 2004

JACKIE stands above a PRINTER as it prints the information

she's looked up about Dr. Lorenson. The PAPER gets jammed,

and that's when JACKIE completely loses it. She WRESTLES with

the printer as if it were responsible for what's happening.

Then she realizes she's not alone. She looks back and sees

CLAIRE, watching from the doorway, with a sympathetic look in

her eyes.

CLAIRE acquiesces with her eyes.

INT. JACKET/TUNNEL PASSAGE

STARKS is trapped: back on the day when Officer Harrison was

murdered.

EXT. HIGHWAY, RURAL VERMONT, WINTER, LATE AFTERNOON, 1992

(Cont'd from the scene after STARKS left Jean and Jackie's

place):

STARKS is walking back on the same highway just after the sun

has set, and just after he helped JEAN and JACKIE, on that

fateful day...

This time we see a CAR stop for him from a much closer

distance. TENNY pulls up towards STARKS and rolls down the

window on the passenger side. STARKS bends down to be able to

see the driver.

STARKS considers this.

We pull back and see the same SHOT, from a distance, of

STARKS putting his BAG in the back and getting in. As he

opens the CAR DOOR, we hear the MUSIC playing inside. As they

drive off, the MUSIC fades further and further in the

distance as we...

INT. BEDROOM, JACKIE'S APARTMENT, NIGHT

It's the night that they slept together, and the departure we

never saw. We see, from Starks' POV, JACKIE sleeping

serenely in the bed.

We catch one glimpse of STARKS in the moonlight, standing

naked in the doorway, before he turns and then...disappears --

having been taken out of the Jacket at that point.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, VERMONT, 2004

JACKIE is by STARKS' side, lying on the hospital bed, next to

him, smoothing his sweating head.

STARKS' eyes flutter open.

STARKS nods; JACKIE tries to continue without choking up.

JACKIE's VOICE fades as we...

INT. LORENSON'S HOME, VERMONT, NIGHT, 1992

LORENSON watches EUGENE continue to look unresponsively

in the distance.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, VERMONT, 2004 (SOME TIME LATER)

STARKS is awake, watching JACKIE sleep wearily on his chest.

He sees the TOLL this has taken on her, just as he senses he

is about to be taken out of the Jacket. He nudges her gently.

JACKIE stirs her eyes to look at him.

STARKS, faint, struggles to get out of the bed.

STARKS   moves towards the bathroom of the hospital room.

JACKIE   moves to help him and he motions for her to stop.

STARKS   falters in the doorway when he turns to look back at

Jackie   -- like it might be for the last time.

STARKS nods, then goes in and closes the door behind him.

JACKIE stares after him -- alone in the total silence of the

room. She listens for the slightest noise and that's when she

actually hears the sound of the DRAWER being opened for

herself.

She realizes he's gone. She RUSHES after him, opens the door

in a fit, and then, sees what she feared most: no sign of

Starks. JACKIE falls to her knees, right there, on the

bathroom floor and cries out like a woman only beginning to

realize how unfathomably deep her heart is...

INT. ALPINE GROVE, 2004

STARKS is suddenly in the waiting area outside Lorenson's

office -- still severely weakened.

He walks slowly to the OFFICE DOOR and feebly knocks.

LORENSON answers and STARKS falls into her arms.

INT. LORENSON'S OFFICE

LORENSON has laid STARKS down on the COUCH in her office.

STARKS can barely talk. He spews as much of it as he can out

in his feverish state...

LORENSON is stilled by the words STARKS just spoke.

STARKS clutches his side in pain as they prepare to take him

out.

But when we look to see STARKS' reaction, he's not there...

INT. BECKER'S OFFICE, ALPINE GROVE, EVENING

BECKER is dressed to leave the hospital when he suddenly

decides not to. He takes off his coat and his gloves, but not

his SCARF, and walks out of his office with a decided

urgency.

INT. MORGUE, BASEMENT, ALPINE GROVE, 1992

BECKER pulls STARKS out of the drawer and looks down ruefully

at STARKS' scathed face. STARKS, drenched in BLOOD and SWEAT,

seeks the outline of Becker's face in the light.

BECKER looses the straps around Starks' neck to help him

speak.

BECKER momentarily loses color and his forever cool mien.

After some seconds, STARKS passes out and BECKER -- hands

trembling -- looks as though he might stick him back in when,

instead, he starts to remove him from the Jacket himself. He

silently and carefully unties each of the straps -- taking

unusual care for Starks' flesh as he prepares to put him on a

stretcher.

INT. STARKS' ROOM, ICU, ALPINE GROVE, EARLY MORNING

As the SUN starts to rise, we see STARKS -- now cleaned up --

recovering in his bed. He is unconscious. From his window, we

look down and see Dr. Lorenson's car pulling into the lot...

INT. STARKS' ROOM, ICU, ALPINE GROVE, EARLY MORNING

LORENSON, still wearing her winter gear, walks into Starks'

room, anxiously checking his VITALS. Her anxious expression

reveals Starks' frailty. She looks to the window then and

sees an empty chair with only Becker's SCARF on it.

LORENSON goes to the window in time to see BECKER getting

into his car.

INT. STARKS' ROOM, ICU WARD, ALPINE GROVE, LATER THAT MORNING

STARKS lies unconscious in the bed. The NURSE, SALLY, stops

by the room to check on Dr. Lorenson.

LORENSON looks after her as she leaves.

INT. STARKS' ROOM, ICU WARD, ALPINE GROVE, MORNING, 1992

LORENSON wakes up as STARKS stirs in his sleep, slowly waking

up.

LORENSON doesn't answer.

LORENSON still gets taken aback by Starks' knowledge of

Eugene.

It's true; no one could have known about Lorenson's private

life. STARKS coughs, clearly in great pain.

LORENSON has no choice.

STARKS closes his eyes, gathering what strength he can.

That's all STARKS can manage before LORENSON sees he's about

to pass out again.

INT. LORENSON'S APARTMENT, NIGHT, 1992

LORENSON answers the KNOCK at her door. It's EUGENE and

TALIA.

LORENSON looks at TALIA helplessly. TALIA nods and leads

Eugene inside. LORENSON can't help but look down the hall to

make sure no one's there.

INT. STUDY/OFFICE, LORENSON'S APARTMENT, NIGHT, 1992

LORENSON sits across from EUGENE, holding up a picture of a

DOG. Between them is a tray of MILK and COOKIES.

But Eugene can't hold the sound of the letter long enough to

make the word. An absence seizure takes hold of him as he

looks out unconsciously into space.

LORENSON moves closer to him.

LORENSON checks Eugene's pulse and leans in close to the

boy's unconscious face like the answer is there if she just

looks hard enough.

LORENSON spots a corner of Eugene's EYE twitching slightly,

and, rushing to get a better look, takes the shade off of the

nearby LAMP and holds it above his head so she can get a

better look at him.

Just then, TALIA opens the door, startling Lorenson. She

knocks over the MILK and, as it spills on the LAMP CORD -- now

on Eugene's lap -- it causes an ELECTRIC SHOCK. Eugene catches

it. TALIA gasps and Lorenson watches the boy in fear.

The moment passes and Eugene -- more responsive than he has

ever been before -- looks at his mother and Lorenson. He

doesn't know what's happened but he is aware, and awake,

like never before.

EUGENE picks right up where he and Lorenson left off.

TALIA and LORENSON look at him and each other at shock.

EUGENE holds Lorenson's gaze steadily for a few moments.

TALIA looks at LORENSON. She's still confused. LORENSON's

merely surprised.

INT. STARKS' ROOM, ICU UNIT, ALPINE GROVE, 1992

STARKS looks up from his PAPER -- now covered in WORDS -- to

see Dr. Lorenson in the doorway. STARKS still looks weak but

much better than before.

LORENSON nods.

STARKS folds the LETTER.

EXT. PARKING LOT, ALPINE GROVE, 1992

LORENSON helps STARKS into the parking lot as it snows.

INT. LORENSON'S CAR, DAY, 1992

LORENSON and STARKS are driving on the same, now familiar

highway.

Bob Dylan plays on the RADIO. STARKS smiles as he hears him

and turns the music up; the act is sad because, as LORENSON

notices, it belongs to someone with an interest to live.

EXT. JACKIE AND JEAN'S HOUSE, DAY, 1992

DR. LORENSON and STARKS drive up to Jean and Jackie's house.

STARKS slowly makes his way to their front door and knocks on

it as best as he can. The sound, however, is still

understandably soft.

STARKS waits and then reaches for the knob on the door. He

opens it and looks inside. We first see his face, and the

devastation on it, as we guess the sight he's laid eyes on.

JACKIE is sitting at the kitchen table, still only 7 years

old. Though STARKS expected it, he falters under the

disappointment of seeing a girl he liked instead of the woman

he loved. As she looks up at him, it's all he can do not to

break down.

STARKS shakes his head, looking at her. She looks beautiful,

and still hopeful. Her life lays ahead of her and her fate --

when he found her in 2004 -- remains as distant as possible

from this innocent, still promising image.

JACKIE smiles; she doesn't get asked that often.

STARKS nods. JACKIE smiles. It's all he can do not to

crumble.

She looks at him and senses, like kids do, the desperation in

his eyes.

JACKIE calls out for Jean, then runs up the stairs to get

her. LORENSON has gotten out of the car and is waiting

outside on the porch. STARKS remains in the doorway.

Some seconds later, JEAN appears -- gaunt but in a slightly

better state than we saw her before.

JEAN looks a little confused.

She gives him a once over, and, seeing how weakened he looks,

decides intuitively he can't be much harm. She also notices

LORENSON waiting by the car.

STARKS looks at JACKIE, hesitating because of her. Sensing

this, JEAN asks Jackie to leave.

JACKIE leaves and walks to the yard. STARKS watches.

STARKS hands her the LETTER.

JEAN looks baffled but, seeming to grasp his urgency, nods.

JACKIE has been watching this exchange from the shed. When he

looks over there, he catches her eye and CALLS OUT, with what

strength he has left...

These are the hardest words STARKS has probably ever had to

say. JACKIE just stares after him, as does JEAN, as he shows

himself out.

EXT. JACKIE AND JEAN'S HOUSE, DAY, 1992

As STARKS is walking away, we see his eyes begin to tear in

the cold -- but not from it.

INT. JACKIE AND JEAN'S HOUSE, DAY, 1992

JACKIE abruptly runs after him.

STARKS stops in his tracks; he clears as much sadness from

his face as he can before he turns around to face her.

Then, suddenly, she sticks her hand for him to shake, as she

did that day on the roadside; only now, it trembles slightly

in the cold.

STARKS takes JACKIE'S HAND and holds it in his own softly and

affectionately. JEAN and DR. LORENSON look on curiously as

STARKS looks in her face, at her hand in his, and then to the

heavens for the means to get through this.

As STARKS lets go at last, JACKIE looks back at him, sensing

the connection even if she doesn't know it yet.

STARKS turns and stumbles as he walks back to his car.

LORENSON moves to help him, but STARKS tells her not to with

his eyes. He makes his way to the car on his own.

MONTAGE:

INT. LIVING ROOM, JEAN AND JACKIE'S HOUSE, DAY, 1992

JEAN sits down and starts to open the LETTER. Starks' voice,

as we hear it now, is presumably from parts of the LETTER

he's written to her.

INT. LORENSON'S CAR, DUSK, 1992

LORENSON looks over to STARKS, who stares painfully out the

window. They drive on in silence.

INT. ALPINE GROVE, NEW YEAR'S EVE, 1992-1993

STARKS walks back through the gates of the hospital,

despondently returning inside, with LORENSON at his side.

INT. WARD, ALPINE GROVE, EVENING

MACKENZIE looks up from his game of solitaire as LORENSON

helps STARKS down the hall. He holds up his hand in the

gesture of hello, or goodbye.

STARKS raises his hand back with an earnest smile.

INT. BECKER'S HOME, SHELBOURNE, 1992

We see BECKER taking his DRUGS. In his dark den, on his worn

desk, is a bottle of WHISKEY. He closes his eyes as he

administers to himself whatever aid he can...

INT. JACKIE AND JEAN'S HOUSE, DAY, DECEMBER 31, 1992

JEAN is reading each page avidly, affected by this man's last

words.

INT. SMALL BAR, CANADA, NIGHT, 1992

TENNY (Officer Harrison's murderer) is at the bar ordering a

drink from the BARTENDER. As he gets his DRINK, he slaps a

BILL down on the counter and turns around to survey the bar...

INT. JACKIE'S ROOM, JACKIE AND JEAN'S HOUSE, EVENING, 1992

JACKIE rummages in a box of her personal belongings, looking

for something specific in them. She stops finally when she

finds STARKS' DOG TAGS. She takes them out slowly and puts

them around her neck.

Then, after a moment of staring down at them, she tucks them

under her sweater.

INT. CAPTAIN MEDLEY'S HOME, NIGHT, 1992

CAPTAIN MEDLEY holds a beer as he stares blankly at a TV

broadcasting news about MIKE TYSON'S RAPE CONVICTION.

Medley's barely watching the footage...

INT. STARKS' ROOM, ALPINE GROVE, 1992

Dr. Lorenson helps Starks back to bed. STARKS looks up at

Lorenson, thanking her without words but with his eyes.

LORENSON smiles as she looks back sadly at Starks' even more

weakened self.

Then he turns and walks out, closing the door so that Starks'

room and the screen darken at the same time.

INT. HALLWAY, ALPINE GROVE, NEW YEAR'S EVE, 1992

TWO PAIRS of legs walk down a corridor, darkened by the

night, through the now familiar passage to the basement...

STARKS is not restrained this time though we don't see who is

walking down the hall with him. He runs his hand over his

forehead and looks at it when he's done. STILL NO CUT.

They slow down their pace as they round the corner, as STARKS

appears dizzier and dizzier. He doesn't stop and the PERSON

beside him doesn't see how weak he is... until STARKS TRIPS.

In slow motion, we hear a DISTANT, GARBLED VOICE CALL OUT...

But STARKS' head hits the GLASS CASE of the FIRE EXTINGUISHER

on the wall, as it was destined to. In the terrific SHOWER OF

GLASS, one PIECE cuts a neat, deep, fatal GASH in Starks'

head.

BLOOD starts to flow. As STARKS' eyes struggle to regain

their focus, we see the BLURRED, indiscernible FACE of the

PERSON leaning over him to see if he's all right.

The details start to make sense, even to Starks. This is the

WOUND they said he died from.

INT. MORGUE, BASEMENT, ALPINE GROVE, NEW YEAR'S EVE, 1992

STARKS collapses on the familiar slab, ready to be strapped

into the Jacket one final time. BLOOD pours from his head

onto the floor.

The PERSON with him struggles to get all of Starks' weight

onto the metal slab. She's doing it as carefully, and gently,

as she can -- taking observable care with every strap of the

JACKET, almost as if the act itself is a humane one.

When the HANDS finally reach the straps around his neck and

the hardest part of the struggle has passed, STARKS smiles

kindly, and thankfully, into the single overhead LIGHT in the

room that obscures the face of the person strapping him in.

As the drawer is pushed in, one of the STRAPS gets caught on

the side, CUTTING STARKS' ARM. We hear a small CRY in the

room. Then the HANDS adjust the strap and slowly push STARKS

in.

INT. JACKET/TUNNEL

It's more beautiful and serene inside than it's ever been

before. This time, as he travels through the tunnel, it's as

though he's traveling in a heaven of his own. The IMAGES he

sees are the best moments of his past -- connected in a

tranquil, fluid narrative that suggest STARKS has finally

retrieved his memory without it haunting him...

PANELS:

The PANELS we saw briefly are completed further now.

1) C.U. A WOMAN'S NECK as a small child's HAND touches it.

2) INT. STAIRWAY, OLD HOUSE (STARKS' CHILDHOOD HOME): STARKS,

aged 9, running up the stairs, knocking a PICTURE on the wall

with his elbow...

3) C.U. A black and white PHOTOGRAPH of Starks' father, a

much older version of himself.

4) EXT. CREEK: A shot of clear water that's not to deep and,

on its surface, the reflection of a TEENAGE BOY'S FACE before

he touches it and sends it rippling...

5) EXT. A NEW ENGLAND BEACH: STARKS (20s) dressed in a black

suit, holding an URN, letting the ASHES fly into the water...

6) EXT. DESERT: A SANDSTORM WHIRLS round before it's replaced

with... EXT. VERMONT: A FIELD of snow.

EXT. MORGUE, BASEMENT, MENTAL HOSPITAL

We see now that it was DR. LORENSON who put Starks in.

Exhausted from the physical strain of getting him in there,

she stares at the closed drawer, like looking at it is one

way to look after Starks.

INT. JACKIE AND JEAN'S HOUSE, VERMONT, 1992

JEAN puts down STARKS' LETTER and walks out of the kitchen

and watches JACKIE sitting absently on the couch, looking

past the TV.

JEAN kneels wordlessly beside her daughter and looks her

daughter in the eye. JACKIE looks back curiously as JEAN

wraps her arms around Jackie's LEGS and rests her head in her

lap, holding onto her with the dearness of having narrowly

missed a tragedy.

EXT. DINER, SMALL TOWN VERMONT, 2005

Over the sounds of CARS slushing in the snow, an IMAGE fades

up slowly on the screen, until we see it's STARKS, standing

in the parking lot outside the diner once more.

This time he seems situated, and hopeful. After a slightly

longer wait than the first time, JACKIE walks out -- in the

same way as before except that she wears a NURSE'S UNIFORM

and an unmistakable air of vitality.

Jackie looks directly at Starks and we see the same

attraction between them teeming even more than before. Even

as a physically injured man in jeans and a flannel, with a

BLEEDING CUT on his head and no coat in the cold, STARKS is

someone we see she wants to be near.

Then we see JACKIE as STARKS does: she looks beautiful,

alive, happy and just like the woman he never wanted to

leave. She approaches Starks warmly, less suspicious of the

world -- and less devastated by it -- than we remember her

being.

STARKS revels in the moment. In their reunion.

STARKS touches his FOREHEAD in a panic and, seeing the BLOOD

on his hands, looks up at her, terrified. Sensing this, she

moves closer to calm him.

STARKS looks at her -- immensely relieved and grateful.

STARKS falters slightly as he walks. JACKIE helps him make it

to the car, much like before...

INT. JACKIE'S CAR, 2005

STARKS can hardly keep his eyes off her when her CELL PHONE

suddenly rings.

JACKIE answers it, smiling.

STARKS listens nervously to her conversation and the

affection in her voice.

JACKIE hangs up and looks at Starks -- feeling a little

awkward after the call.

STARKS smiles back warmly at her; he gets it more than she

knows.

EXT. OVERHEAD, VERMONT HIGHWAY, 2005

Jackie's car pulls onto the highway, alongside the other,

more modern cars on the highway.

The happy sound of their engine on the highway continues,

uninterrupted, for some seconds, before, first faintly then

louder, we hear a racking, all too familiar sound: the DRAWER

creaking as it's opened once more...
