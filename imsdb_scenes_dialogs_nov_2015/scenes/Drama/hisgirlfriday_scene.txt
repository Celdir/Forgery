FADE IN: INT. ANTEROOM CLOSE SHOT SWITCHBOARD

Two telephone operators sit at switchboard busy plugging in

and out answering calls.

CAMERA PULLS BACK to disclose the rest of the anteroom. To

Camera left are the elevators -- at back wall directly behind

switchboard are chairs and a table for visitors. Next to

switchboard are stairs leading downward to the next floor. A

waist-high iron grill with a gate in it separates the

switchboard from the anteroom, a similar grill separating it

again from the city room which stretches on beyond

switchboard. At a table in the switchboard enclosure sits an

office boy, about fifteen, doing a crossword puzzle. The big

clock on the back wall shows that it is nearly one o'clock.

Bruce, embarrassed, looks at the office boy, then looks back

at Hildy as they turn toward second gate leading into City

Room.

She starts to push open the iron-grilled gate leading into

the City Room. Bruce quickly springs forward and opens it

for her. Hildy smiles.

She kisses his cheek and walks through. He looks after her.

The office boy whistles. Bruce pays no attention, but stares

after Hildy.

MEDIUM SHOT - SHOOTING DOWN LENGTH OF CITY ROOM

Hildy starts to walk through City Room.

TRUCKING SHOT - HILDY

as she walks the length of the City Room. It's a long walk,

because it's a room that takes up practically the whole floor.

The scene is a busy one. But, gradually, as Hildy starts

down, one after another recognize her. There are cries of:

"Hildy!" "Hello, Hildy", etc., from the men as Hildy goes

straight down the aisle. She never stops but waves her own

greetings: "Jim!" "Hi, good-looking!" "Laura" "Hullo, Pop"

"Nan!" "Eddie!" "Hello, Mac" "Pete!" "Frank" "Oscar!", and

gets responses from each of them. One man is bent over his

desk reading his copy -- he is standing up. Hildy slaps him

as she goes by. He turns around: "Say, who did that?" As he

sees Hildy: "Hello, Hildy!" Hildy: "Hi, Jake." She passes a

middle-aged woman, almost an Edna May Oliver type, seated at

a desk pounding out copy and smoking a cigarette. As Hildy

comes up to her she slaps the woman on the back.

Hildy moves on. CAMERA TRUCKS WITH HER to the end of the

room where she pauses before the frosted glass partition

which separates Walter Burns' office from the rest of the

City Room.

as Hildy follows Burns through the City Room. This time, in

contrast to Hildy's original walk through the room, the groups

are silent as they watch the two.

Burns, at this point, has reached the switchboard. He says,

under his breath, to Maisie:

Hildy, a little out of breath, catches up with him. At the

iron gate that opens into anteroom Hildy jumps ahead, opens

the gate and holds it for Burns.

Hildy follows him out.

INT. ANTEROOM MED. SHOT

as Hildy follows Burns in. Bruce is sitting on the bench. On

the end of a bench sits an old, grizzled Western Union "boy".

Ignoring Bruce, Burns strides over to the "boy", seizes his

hand, shakes it and says:

Hildy behind him. Bruce registers amazement at this.

CLOSE SHOT BURNS AND MESSENGER

The messenger is more amazed than Bruce as Burns keeps pumping

his hand vigorously.

nevertheless.

Burns turns slightly but doesn't release messenger's hand.

attention. Burns turns on him:

He turns away again. Bruce, determinedly, takes hold of his

sleeve and pulls at it.

MEDIUM SHOT

Burns, still pumping the dazed messenger's hand, stops at

this, drops hand, and turns to Bruce:

The messenger isn't quite sure what he's done but he slinks

back to his seat as Burns turns to Bruce.

CLOSEUP HILDY

She is beginning to get sore, but reluctantly again she is

compelled to smile at Walter's behavior.

CLOSE SHOT BURNS AND BRUCE

Burns looks down. Bruce, in unconscious responses, helplessly

lifts his foot up and we see the rubber.

CLOSE SHOT BURNS NEAR OPEN ELEVATOR

We don't see the passengers. Hildy comes into scene.

He jumps into the elevator -- in a second he hops out.

With a look of disgust Hildy gets in. Burns follows and the

door slams on them.

all over.

INT. RESTAURANT CLOSEUP - A BEAMING WAITER

HE GRINS ALL OVER AND SAYS:

He pats Hildy's arm -- she smiles at him.

THREE SHOT - HILDY, BRUCE AND BURNS

That "ow" is sotto voce, but it's the direct result of a

kick under the table from Hildy.

His laugh stops cold and he clutches for his shin again.

Hildy just looks. Providentially, the waiter enters the scene.

He begins serving them.

Gus, who has just managed to come between Hildy and Burns,

lets out a startled "ouch".

They fall to.

INT. PHONE BOOTH FULL SHOT

Burns is listening, has coffee on ledge and sips it now and

then.

He hangs up, smiles, and finishes the coffee. Then he girds

himself for being crushed. He gradually begins to look sunk.

He pulls out a small mirror to study his expression till he

finally gets what he wants. He holds that expression as he

comes out of the booth.

INT. RESTAURANT MED. SHOT AT TABLE

Gus is entering the scene.

He serves Bruce.

Gus serves her and puts still another cup in front of Burns'

comes into the room.

MED. SHOT REPORTERS

They are all talking at once as Hildy comes into the scene.

There are ad libs of "Hildy!" "Where'd you come from?" "Holy

Mackeral, Hildy Johnson!", etc. Hildy raises her hand for

silence.

She enters to a desk, places her bag on top of the desk,

takes her hat off and hangs it on a clothes tree in the

corner, comes back to desk and opens the travelling bag. All

through the above action she is talking rapidly.

Hildy takes notebook and pencil out of bag, looks at the

stockings she is wearing, sees she has a run and takes a

fresh pair out of the bag. She sits down and begins to put

on the new stockings.

Hildy gets up, rolls the pair of stockings she has just

discarded into a ball, crosses to Bensinger's desk and puts

the stockings in a drawer.

She turns and sees Earl Williams, looking more inoffensive

and exhausted than ever, indeed on the verge of collapse. He

carries a large revolver. The search-lights that have been

playing in the courtyard strike into the windows again.

Hildy drops the phone back on the hook.

He advances steadily toward Hildy, the gun aimed at her.

Hildy starts walking toward him, slowly.

Hildy stops.

Hildy sneaks another step forward.

He points the gun at Hildy, pulls the trigger and we hear a

faint "click!"

CLOSE TWO SHOT

He drops the gun and clutches at the edge of the desk for

support. Hildy lurches forward and she grabs the other side

of the desk for support. And at this moment she looks more

tired than he does. She looks at Earl and breathes heavily.

CAMERA FOLLOWS HER as she retrieves the gun and jams it in

her purse, jumps to the windows, pulls down the shades.

Hildy crosses swiftly to the door, locks it and puts out the

lights, so that they are visible only faintly in the light

from the areaway.

Hildy is looking around for a hiding place for him.

He abruptly crumples and falls to the floor. Hildy stands

for a second, desperate. Then she picks him up and half

carries, half drags him over toward a chair and places him

in it. Then she makes a quick dash for her phone.

Another phone there rings. Hildy answers it, propping the

receiver of her own phone between ear and shoulder.

She hangs up and turns into second phone.

There is a knocking on the door, but she doesn't hear it.
