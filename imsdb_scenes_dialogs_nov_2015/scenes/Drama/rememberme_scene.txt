Tyler takes out a cigarette. Lights it. Without saying a word

his mother takes it and snubs it out in an empty water glass.

Caroline, as bemused as an eleven year old can be, looks at

her mother, then at her brother. She adopts a very motherly

tone.

She flickers a glance at her ex husband and squeezes Les'

hand.

The WAITRESS brings platefuls of extravagant cheesecake to

the table. Les dives in. Charles is having toast. He sips a

glass of water and takes a surreptitious glance at his Patek

Phillippe.

Caroline looks a bit sheepish, Tyler high fives Caroline.

Diane, again, flickers a glance at Charles.

Beat.

Diane touches Caroline's hair.

The 'Single Lady's Universal Tote'.

It's the one-night-stand travel

pack for women. We throw in some

make-up, toiletries, cell phone

charger, cab numbers. Retail it at

S19.95, maybe do an infomercial.

And you think women would buy this?

With money?

Hey one-night-stands happen... It's

a part of life... like stubbing

your toe. Sometimes you misjudge a

corner and bend back your pinky

toe, other times you wake up in a

freshman dorm wearing a field

hockey tee shirt wondering why your

balls smell like cinnamon...

Of course. Yes.

Don't underestimate the novelty

gift market. Think about it...

instead of giving that token slutty

friend a ten-inch purple dildo for

her birthday, you hook her up with

"The SLUT." Everyone has a laugh

and the implication that she'll

probably use it someday remains.

What do you say? Are you down?

I'm down with getting you on some

sort of medication.

OK...fine...be cynical...just

remember at some point in history

two people had a conversation just

like this about the light bulb. One

of them went on to fame and fortune

and the other one probably went to

work at Mickey D's or something.

Or Denny's. Denny's was big in the

19th century.

The statue is warm, the bronze absorbing the late spring sun.

Tyler is perched on the Mad Hatter, his face turned towards

the sun while Caroline hides with the dormouse.

Tyler lights a cigarette. AN UPTIGHT MOMMY glares at him.

He makes a face.

Tyler takes a final drag. Tosses it on the ground.

Caroline gives him a look.

Caroline is climbing around Alice. Her hands on Alice's hair.

13   INT. THE STRAND BOOKSTORE -- DAY                            13

He gestures to the shelves.

Beat.

Tyler laughs.

Aidan, visibly frustrated with Tyler's reluctance, grabs the

rolling ladder and pushes Tyler into the Romance novels.

14   INT. DON HILL'S -- THAT NIGHT                                14

15   EXT. GREENWICH STREET -- LATE NIGHT                          15

There's a gust of wind. Aidan's girl shivers. She's wearing a

tiny dress.

O/S WE HEAR: a beer bottle crashing on the ground, and from

far away a ghostly, plaintive girl's voice disappearing into

the night...

Tyler turns towards the sound. It's as if he's trying to spot

a train in the distance. His hand goes to his pocket and

fishes out his pack of cigarettes.

She walks away, looking back at her friend, annoyed.

Tyler's Girl looks at Tyler, who is still preoccupied.

The girls step away. Tyler's Girl appears to be trying to

convince her friend to stay. Aidan watches them, hopefully.

Tyler isn't watching them. He's watching two cool looking

MUSICIANS, crossing the street with the LIGHT, carrying SOUND

EQUIPMENT.

A quartet of NEANDERTHALS pulls up at the light in front of

them in a car, aggressive music playing. The Neanderthal at

the wheel has the brilliant idea to rev his engine and lurch

the car forward, startling the musicians, toying with them.

MUSICIAN #1 glares, but gives no further response, he just

wants to get across the street. The Neanderthal revs and

lurches again.

MUSICIAN #2 slams his hand on the hood of the car.

The car's four doors open, and the Neanderthals lope to the

front of the car. The driver is holding a mini baseball bat

at his side.

A Neanderthal shoves one of the musicians, and the driver

starts wailing on the other with the bat. Tyler watches as

the Neanderthals overpower them. The altercation has turned

into a full on assault. The Musicians are getting stomped

into the pavement.

Tyler walks right past the girl without even looking at her.

Aidan runs off after Tyler.

Tyler jumps fully into the thick of it, swinging, grabbing

the beefiest Neanderthal in a choke hold and pounding the

guy's face. He fights like a pit bull. Not feeling, not

stopping.

Aidan gets punched in the face. Tyler elbows the nose of the

guy who punched Aidan and it spurts blood. Then someone hits

Tyler in the gut, and he doubles over and takes a knee to the

chin. The musicians get back to their feet and fight back.

It's a brawl.

16   EXT. SIDE STREET -- LATER                                   16

Aidan gives Tyler's elbow a gentle tug. Tyler's caught up in

the action.

Rage flickers across Craig's face.

Craig moves down the line to one of the musicians, going

through their pockets.

Tyler, compelled, drawing closer to the action.

Tyler steps forward, interrupting...

Aidan, who has been edging away, jerks around to his friend.

Craig, big angry Irish cop, turns to Tyler.

Craig moves slowly toward Tyler and starts going through

Tyler's pockets, roughly. He finds his wallet. Starts rifling

through.

What the hell? Craig looks from the guy he was frisking to

Tyler's girl, wrapped in a blanket. She spits blood. He turns

a bit to Tyler.

He turns back to work.

Tyler looks briefly at Aidan. Aidan looks desperate "Please!

Let's get out of here!"

Tyler TOUCHES CRAIG'S ELBOW.

Aidan's jaw drops. Leo takes several silent steps in. Craig

looks at his own elbow then looks at Tyler. The kid must be

out of his mind.

SLAM. Craig takes Tyler's legs out, driving his face into the

pavement, a GASH opens above Tyler's LEFT EYE. Tyler lies

there dazed and disoriented as Craig, with one knee on

Tyler's neck, crushes his face into the ground. He slaps the

cuffs on.

Ally enters. She wears a big sweatshirt. Aidan spots her.

Tyler watches her settle into a couch with a big cup of

coffee.

Tyler sighs, begins toward Ally.

Tyler glares. Aidan gives a big thumbs up.

Ally briefly looks up from her book.

He gives her a charming smile.

Beat. The smile usually works.

Ally looks at him, a little wearily, holding her place in the

book.

Tyler is genuinely taken aback.

A surprised laugh escapes from Tyler.

Aidan holds a MATH TEXTBOOK at an awkward angle to mask his

obvious interest in Ally and Tyler's conversation.

She looks at Aidan, briefly, who shifts to avoid her gaze.

Then she takes a peek at Tyler's profile.

He indicates the dishes.

He flicks a bit of water on her shirt. Ally takes a beat.

Ally's not having it.

Tyler's a little confused.

Tyler blinks helplessly.

An entire enormous pot of pasta water up ended on the host.

Bits of spaghetti cling to him, tiny tomatoes and zucchini on

his shoulders like little barnacles. He sputters and gasps

and blinks.

Ally is gently picking spaghetti and tomatoes off Tyler.

Ally looks away for a moment. Tucks a curl behind her ear.

Then they look at each other. Ally opens her mouth to speak.

Aidan bursts in. He's drunk, loud, wearing an Irish Flag like

a cape. He carries a bottle of whiskey and a can of Guinness.

Aidan takes Ally's hand. Kisses it.

Ally looks at Aidan closely, trying to figure out where she

knows him from, it dawns on her.

Tyler pulls his JOURNAL from his pocket. Hands it to her.

Ally is moved, you can see it in her eyes, but she chooses

not to overdo it. She flips through the journal. She hands it

back to him. Then out of nowhere.

Tyler is stunned.

He does.

Aidan goes to answer it.

He blinks.

He throws down the keys, then yells towards the roof...

With Diane's knock the door swings open.

He gives her a kiss on the cheek.

Aidan looks and realizes that the phone is indeed off the

hook, as just the handset, wrapped in duct tape, is visible

on top of the sofa.

Tyler and Ally enter the apartment through the fire escape

Diane is thrilled. She has a huge mom grin.

Diane is pumping Ally's hand like she's drilling for oil.

She navigates the IKEA carnage and sits on the sofa, the

joint smoldering in the ashtray in front of her. Aidan ever

the gent, removes the ashtray to the window ledge.

Beat.

Tyler looks completely befuddled. Aidan passes Diane the

joint. She takes a deep hit.

The women measure each other.

She starts to drag Aidan out the window, back up the fire

escape, but he makes a brief detour.

She hands it back to him and Aidan and Ally climb away.

Tyler sits next to his mom and lights a cigarette.

Tyler rubs his eyes.

Beat.

Charles adjusts his tie and goes back to his steak.

Charles looks at his son. Puts his fork down.

Silence at the table.

Back to the steak.

Beat.

Charles looks up, taken aback.

Tyler tries to get a word in.

Charles and Ally burst out laughing. Tyler rolls his eyes

--TIME CUT

Dessert. Ally is working on an enormous profiterole. Tyler,

another whiskey.

His cell phone lights up. Charles gently puts his hand on

hers.

Everyone is a little sunburnt, the adults are a little drunk.

Ally is wrapped up in Tyler, Caroline is on her mom's lap on

the floor, Les next to them, lying on his stomach. Aidan is

up and God only knows what he's doing

More raucous laughter.

Whoops of laughter heretofore unheard in Montauk.

She rises and flees into the kitchen. Les rolls over and ends

up with his head in Diane's lap. He looks at her for a

moment.

Diane beams at him.

Tyler smiles at his mom and Les, then at Ally. Diane takes a

deep look at her son. Her eyes shining.

79   INT. AMTRACK -- PASSENGER CAR (MOVING) -- DAY               79

Ally laughs.

Tyler is laughing. Ally thinks for a moment.

Aidan gives a satisfied smile.

The car doors open and a MAN ushers his family through.   It's

Craig's partner Leo, in plain clothes.

He begins to bob his head to a rhythm.

Ally and Tyler collapse in laughter as Craig's Partner passes

He notices Ally immediately. She doesn't see him. He takes a

long look at Tyler as he follows his wife and kids into the

next car.

The train makes a stop at Patchogue. Leo and family

disembark.

80   INT. TYLER'S APARTMENT BUILDING -- HALLWAY -- LATER          80

Craig's face, like his wife's so many years ago, is pure

contempt. With his body at this angle, Tyler can now see his

gun.

Craig closes the distance.

From Tyler's P.O.V he looks like a freight train.

In a flash, he gets Tyler in a choke hold, flips him on his

back on the bed and puts his hands around Tyler's throat.

Silence, except for exertion.

Tyler's hands are on Craig's wrists. He is holding Craig's

eye. His face is starting to turn colors.

Beat.

Beat.

It travels between the two men. Craig grappling with it,

although he still has his hands at Tyler's throat.

Craig drops his hands, pushes himself off Tyler

Tyler rolls to one side, coughing and gagging.

Craig leans against the wall for support.

81   INT. RAILROAD FLAT-- LATER.                               81

Beat.

She lunges for the phone. Tyler stops her hand.

She looks like she's starting to panic.

She isn't quite getting it.

She's got it.

Beat.

She bolts from the chair to the sink and dry heaves. Tyler

reaches out to comfort her.

She reels around and cracks him across the face. Not like a

chick. Like her dad.

The sound hangs in the air.

Ally goes to the bedroom and starts throwing her stuff in her

bag. Tyler follows her.
