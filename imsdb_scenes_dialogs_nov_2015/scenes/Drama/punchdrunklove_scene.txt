INT. WAREHOUSE - EARLY MORNING

CAMERA (STEADICAM) holds on a man in a suit, sitting behind

a desk, on the phone: BARRY EGAN (Adam Sandler)

OC DISTANT SOUND OF A CAR SKIDDING TO A STOP, SOME VAGUE,

DISTANT SCREAMING IS HEARD...THEN SILENCE. Barry hears this,

gets distracted, then back to the phone call;

He hangs up the phone and walks through his warehouse. It's

fairly non-descript place, boxing materials, etc. Products

seem to be mainly silly novelties (pens that light up, key

chains, novelty toilet plungers, etc)

He lifts a LOADING DOOR and LIGHT POURS INSIDE, WASHES OUT

THE FRAME....he's silhouette....CAMERA follows him

out...stays overexposed and over his shoulder as he looks

down towards the street.....

...his business is situated at the end of a common driveway,

shared with a few other nondescript places and an Auto

mechanic....distant SOUND of a car SPEEDING and SKIDDING....

....hold, then:

....a JEEP CHEROKEE comes FLIPPING into FRAME, far off at

the mouth of the alley, on the street. The JEEP ends up

landing RIGHT SIDE UP....HOLD....

.....Barry flinches a little, stares.....the JEEP sits idle

for a moment....then it drives off....then:

A speeding, small TOYOTA comes into view at the mouth of the

alley, screeching to a halt. The passenger side door opens

and a small, wooden HARMONIUM (like a portable organ) is

placed on the ground. The TOYOTA speeds away.....

....a moment or two later another NON-DESCRIPT CAR flies

past very fast....

BEAT. Barry squints, looks at the small HARMONIUM sitting

alone in the middle of the street.

He hesitates, looks around, holds, then walks back inside

his warehouse.

INT. BARRY'S WAREHOUSE - THAT MOMENT

Barry on the phone again;

He hangs up the phone and walks outside, CAMERA follows him

again, out to the alley, over his shoulder......he looks

down the length of the alley at the Harmonium. HOLD, THEN:

A small FORD ESCORT pulls into the driveway, around the

Harmonium, parks......a young woman named LENA LEONARD

(Emily Watson) exits the car and starts to walk down the

length of the alley towards him.....CAMERA stays over his

shoulder and turns into a profile 2-shot;

BEAT. Barry gently steps back and out of the FRAME.

Lena hands him her keys, he steps back into FRAME, THEN:

BEAT.

She walks away....he starts back inside the warehouse,

hesitates, watches her go.....right before she reaches the

end of the alley, she glances back quickly, over her

shoulder....he dodges inside real quick.....

HOLD THE EMPTY FRAME......then he steps back out.....looks

off at the Harmonium.....and the empty street.....he looks

around some more....then he makes the long walk down the

street.

ON THE STREET.

Barry stares at the Harmonium a little bit, looks around,

both ways, then casually picks it up and walks back towards

his business.....

He brings it into his office and places it on his desk. He

tries a few keys....pressing down...there's no sound.

He presses his hand on the foot pedal and presses a key and

a small note is made.....BEAT....he does it again....and

holds the note.....

INT. WAREHOUSE - OFFICE - EARLY MORNING

Barry enters the warehouse with harmonium and runs into his

office. He places it on the desk and hits a key: no sound.

Barry goes to his knees and unlatched the bellows. He pumps

the bellow, reaches up, presses a note, and another...then

stands up into CU. and presses the 5 note

melody......SUDDENLY: THE SOUND OF THE POD BAY DOOR SLIDING....

....Barry spins around, scared shitless, sees: LANCE, who

enters the warehouse, Barry rushes out to greet him;

They enter into the office, Lance sees the harmonium;

Lance walks around behind the harmonium....leaving Barry

alone....towards the warehouse......he starts to back up a

little.....

Sal, Ernesto and Rico all start to come into work behind

Barry.....he sees them: CAMERA pushes in on Barry....

CUSTOMERS about the plungers which are on display in front

of them. They speak all over each other doing shop talk, etc;

In the b.g., RICO over the laud speaker says:

Rico turns around, without loudspeaker;

They look at him a moment....

ANGLE, REVERSE. Barry turns and heads for the phone nearby

at Rico's station;

She hangs up.

Barry takes a few steps back to the Customers:

Barry tries again to ignore it....

Barry walks back to the phone;

Barry snaps out of this, turns, claps his hands in confidence

and walks back to the customers and says:

He takes one of the plungers and to demonstrate smacks it on

the table....it SMASHES and rice falls out everywhere....

Lance moves to get a new plunger....

Barry holds, then;

Barry walks this time into his office......CAMERA tracks

with Barry to his office, seeing him try and shake this

off.....He EXITS FRAME.

His face gets bright red, he holds back tears, opens his

mouth and has a serious but small burst of overwhelming

emotion and then it's over.

INT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT

Barry's hands reaches in and picks a birthday card.

pushes it straight into a SIX YEAR OLD KID who's pushing a

cart around....they slam into each other....

Barry apologizes....the KID just takes off....Barry's cart

now has a slightly damaged wheel that wobbles like crazy....

talking away....they turn and see him;

Another sister, RHONDA, enters from behind, Barry jumps, says:

She gives him a very quick hug and kiss and sets the cake

next to a bigger, cooler looking cake.

Mia approaches holding a baby.....Barry tries to say hello

to the baby, but Mia slowly turns the baby out of Barry's

grasp....making herself the center of his attention;

KITCHEN/DINING ROOM, THAT MOMENT

Barry gets slightly turned around trying to reach the

baby...and ends up in a doorway that leads to the dining

room, revealing himself to: ELIZABETH, KAREN, NICOLE AND

ANNA. There are also: THREE BROTHER IN LAW'S (WALTER, LARRY

AND STEVE)

KAREN steps up and greets him;

Barry shakes hands and hello's with the brother in law's.

ceiling sliding glass doors.....in an INSTANT, he TURNS AND

THROWS HIS FIST STRAIGHT THROUGH THREE OF THEM, THEY

him in silence. HOLD, THEN:

In unison they all go ape shit:

stacked neatly in a corner. Barry stops dead in his tracks

something....He stands up quick;

He backs away, then steps OUT OF FRAME...a moment later

ELIZABETH (his sister) and LENA (from the opening) enter the

warehouse, walking towards Barry;

CAMERA pushes in towards LENA and blends to 30fps...she

smiles, looks ahead, CAMERA slowly pans a 180 around to

become her POV.

IN THE OFFICE, THAT MOMENT

He picks up the phone.

Barry instantly hangs up the phone, turns around and walks

back to Lena;

No response from Barry. (cut to reverse 2-shot as they look)

BEAT. In the b.g., two WORKERS are dealing with getting a

large crate on top of a large stack of crates, they're using

a fork lift....in an instant the large CRATE tumbles to the

ground and SMASHES....Barry attempts to not notice this;

The workers start calling out and apologizing for this to

Barry, who keeps looking straight ahead to Lena;

There's another LOUD CRASH as they try to reposition the box

that's fallen, giving way to something else that FALLS. In

other words, to correct the mistake they've already made,

they have to sacrifice another CRATE that CRASHES. She

looks, Barry just flinches, tries to stay looking straight

ahead; CAMERA (HAND HELD) with Elizabeth, comes walking back

in.....says to Barry:

Lena and Elizabeth leave. CAMERA leads them as they walk;

Sound starts to drop out, we see Barry and the boys cleaning

up the boxes in the back....move into a CU on Lena....Music

Cue. Score. treated piano, small rhythm/melodic(notes of

harmonium so far)/gentle.

Lena gets into her car. Elizabeth keeps walking. She waits

until Elizabeth is out of sight at the mouth of the driveway

and then she gets back out of her car and walks straight

back into the warehouse.

INT. WAREHOUSE - THAT MOMENT

She comes walking in and over to Barry;

They do a small search for a piece of paper, get it all

written down and sorted out and then -- as they do this

there is even more CRASHING AND SMASHING in the b.g., by the

boys -- Barry and Lena settle up and say so long.

She walks off. CAMERA leads her out, holds a CU. as she

smiles to herself -- lead her a bit more until she's

outside, and she gets in her car --

CU. BARRY. He smiles, looks around, holds back his emotion

so it looks like he'll explode....tenses, smiles, tears,

looks around....HOLD. End Music Que.
