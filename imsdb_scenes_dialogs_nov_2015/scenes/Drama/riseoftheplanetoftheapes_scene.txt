EYES. Expressive, alive. Human?

EXT. GROVE OF TREES -- DAY

She sits in a tree with ALPHA, her mate - large and muscular,

a PROMINENT WHITE BIRTHMARK ACROSS HIS SHOULDER, LIKE A

SHOOTING STAR.

Around them, under the TREE CANOPY, a COMMUNITY OF

CHIMPANZEES naps, eats, plays.

EXT. WEST AFRICAN JUNGLE - DAY

A DOZEN POACHERS on horseback slog through the jungle.

They're working towards the GROVE, visible in the distance.

As they near it, the LEADER points, sending the MEN moving

quietly, NETS and RIFLES ready.

EXT. CANOPY - DAY

Alpha sits up, sensing something. BIRDS take sudden flight.

He stands on the branch and YELLS OUT A WARNING. FEAR

ignites the community - but too late.

POACHERS BURST INTO THE CLEARING, horses' hooves kicking up

dirt. CHIMPS SCATTER.

Bright Eyes wants to stay by Alpha's side, but he bares his

teeth and sends her off.

Then he drops, landing firmly on the clearing floor. All

around him, POACHERS pursue terrified apes, nets swinging.

MALE CHIMPANZEES jump up and down, SHOUTING AND SCREECHING -

an aggressive show. A futile attempt to protect the tribe.

Alpha zeroes in on a POACHER attempting to scoop up a YOUNG

CHIMP. He streaks across the clearing, KNOCKS THE POACHER

FROM HIS MOUNT.

Alpha POUNDS his CHEST, letting out a BATTLE CRY -- trying to

rally a counter-attack.

But the other chimps pay no heed. There's no organization to

the defense. It's chaos.

SHOTS RING OUT. The Chimps mauling the Poacher drop, one by

one. Others take off.

2.

Alpha spots Bright Eyes across the clearing, dragged off in a

net. He RUSHES to save her, leaps in the air...

A SHOT RINGS OUT.

BRIGHT EYES WATCHES - HORRIFIED - AS ALPHA CRUMPLES IN THE

AIR AND FALLS TO THE GROUND. LIKE A STONE.

FADE TO WHITE

TWO FACES wearing SURGICAL MASKS lean in and peer down at us.

FRANKLIN - broken horn-rimmed glasses - and CAROLINE - curly

red hair under a sterile cap.

Nanotherapy, beta version: Tuesday,

March 10, 2011. Female Test

subject Number four.

Franklin reaches for us, smiles...

Here we go, Bright eyes.

A MIST fogs our view for a moment.

Not too much. She needs to be

calm, but alert.

VOICE THROUGH INTERCOM

Go ahead - send her through.

A LOUD HUM and we start moving, sliding into a tunnel a

tubular CT SCAN - with a MIRROR on the top.

Now WE SEE OUR FACE REFLECTED: A FEMALE APE IN A GAS MASK.

Bright Eyes.

INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - SAME

WILL RODMAN - late twenties, lab coat over a T-shirt and

jeans - stands at the glass, watching the terrified

chimpanzee slide into the machine.

The focus in his eyes belies the casual dress.

Start the scan.

A TECHIE sits at a computer screen beside Will.

3.

Scanning.

INT. WHITE ROOM -- DAY

Another tech, DONNIE - skinny, tattooed - controls the

Caroline moves to an IV STAND beside the scan. The bag's

full of a PHOSPHORESCENT GREEN LIQUID.

Stuff looks like Kool-aid.

Go ahead, I'm sure you could use

it.

Starting the therapy...

INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - SAME

Will looks at a monitor showing the BRAIN SCAN OF THE CHIMP.

The image starts to shake. Concerned, he looks to the other

room - where he can see the CHIMP'S LEGS SHAKING IN THEIR

RESTRAINTS.

She's convulsing.

Caroline sticks a stethoscope in the tube, listens to Bright

Eyes' heart.

Please keep the monkey still.

He focuses back on the monitor.

She's not a monkey.

Will looks from the monitor to Caroline. His look is

intense, tough to read. She blushes slightly at the heat of

his gaze.

CAROLINE (INTERCOM) (CONT'D)

She's an ape. Chimpanzees,

gorillas and orangutans, they're

all apes.

4.

Good to know. Just keep it from

moving.

She's stung, wonders, why does he have to be such a jerk

sometimes.

He's oblivious to this, instead intent on getting the scan

right. The green liquid moves through the chimp's neck...

Here we go.

Will stares at the scan, his eyes willing the test to

succeed.. .the green liquid LIGHTS UP THE CHIMP'S BRAIN.

CHEER FROM THE GROUP.

Will fights a CONTRACTION OF EXTREME EMOTION that passes

across his face. He quickly hides it - offers up a smile for

the others.

We're on our way.

Good work.

INT. WHITE ROOM - DAY

What is this?

Caroline holds up a picture of a tree for Bright Eyes, who

sits at a table in front of a LEXIGRAM, a lit-up board with

colorful symbols.

Bright Eyes presses a button.

Tree.

SUPER: "ONE MONTH LATER."

Caroline holds up a picture of an acorn.

And this?

The chimp presses another button.

Acorn.

5.

Where does the acorn come from?

Bright Eyes considers... then presses a button.

Acorn.

Yes, but where does the acorn come

from?

Acorn.

Bright Eyes interrupts, now pressing three buttons.

Acorn. Tree. Acorn.

The chimp looks at Caroline, who's stunned, trying to process

the ADVANCED THINKING JUST MANIFESTED. Then she presses

another button.

ELECTRONIC VOICE (CONT'D)

Surprise.

The unnatural voice - paired with Bright Eyes' eerily human-

like gaze - is somehow CREEPY... The IMAGE FREEZES and we...

PULL BACK TO REVEAL: WILL'S OFFICE

Diplomas on the wall, books everywhere. Bright Eyes looks

out at Will from a computer screen. He's got two CT SCANS

sitting on the desk in front of him.

We started the therapy four weeks

ago. This was yesterday.

Will's studying the scans. They look good. Real good.

There's been clear cell growth.

Both on the frontal lobe and the

neocortex.

She's purposely standing close in order to point this out.

He notices but doesn't respond - there's history between them

and he's regretting that - gets in the way.

6.

I see that. But I don't understand

the primate behavioral norms. She

knows an acorn's a seed. Wouldn't

any monkey know that?

No - it's conceptual. Acorn gives

us a tree, which gives us an acorn.

Abstract thought...

In a chimpanzee. Unheard of.

Will turns the possibilities over in his mind. Caroline

moves away from him. He barely notices her now.

You're calling her a monkey just to

piss me off, aren't you?

Start the other's on the 112.

And double this one's dose.

EXT. GEN-SYS LABORATORIES - DUSK

Will climbs into his truck. Alone, he allows his excitement

to show. Abstract thought!

He pulls away from the BIO LAB, which is tucked in a corner

of an old military base.

EXT. GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - DUSK (AERIAL)

EXT. WILL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Will pulls up in front of his house.

Set in a hillside neighborhood, it's neat, nondescript. The

home of a bachelor who hasn't given it much thought.

As Will pulls into the driveway, WE HEAR C SHARP PLAYED OVER

AND OVER ON A PIANO.

7.

INT. WILL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

WALTER RODMAN, 60, sits at the piano dressed in a robe,

stabbing at the key with his finger.

Will enters, his posture almost visually changing with the

emotional weight of this man, his father.

Hey Dad.

Walter looks up, whispers...

John... is that you?

It's me. Will.

As thou dost, Anthony.

(staring at the keys)

.he hears no music. No music...

(heavy Russian accent)

He's been doing that all day.

A Home Aide enters, grabs her coat. This is IRENA.

He found an old book of his.

She pulls a worn paperback of Julius Caesar from Walter's

pocket. He snatches it from her, puts it back.

(shrugging on coat)

I had no idea you liked Shakespeare

so much, Mr. Walter.

My mother was the one. She liked

Shakespeare...

Good night, Walter, hone-ee.

She heads out. Will gently takes his father's arm.

Come on, Dad.

8.

INT. WALTER'S ROOM - NIGHT

Will helps his father change into pajamas.

Remember I told you we were using

Basic Fibroblast Growth Factors on

the apes? Well the therapy seems

to be working. We've seen definite

signs of adult brain neurogenesis.

that's clinical trials.

Walter gives no hint he's even listening, much less

understanding what Will's saying.

Human trials, Dad. Soon.

I rather tell that what is to be

feared than what I fear: for

always... I am Caesar...

There's no way to reach him tonight. Still Will tries..

I'm going to make you better - I

swear it.

His father looks at him. A moment of recognition?

John... ?

No, Dad, it's me. Will.

Will helps the old man under the bedcovers.

John's gone.

walls - Walter's name on all of them. (Physics, Astronomy.)

9.

Will looks at his father lying there on his back, staring up

at the ceiling. The once brilliant man now slipping away.

INT. WILL'S STUDY - LATE NIGHT

It's late. Signs of a half-eaten frozen dinner on the desk

beside numerous papers, charts, and Will's computer.

He looks exhausted, gulps from a cup of coffee as he works.

INT. PRIMATE LAB - DAY

Franklin moves from cage to cage, greeting the apes.

Good morning, Felix. Bam Bam.

Monty. Hey - what's the matter,

don't like my cooking?

SUPER: TWO WEEKS LATER

He pauses in front of Bright Eyes, huddled at the back of her

cage.

You okay back there?

Something wrong with Bright Eyes?

I'll check on her when we're done.

Franklin unlocks a cage and leads a CHIMP - LUCKY - into the

next room, where Caroline waits beside the CT scanner.

Lucky's head is shaved, exposing a long, curving scar on his

cranium.

From Bright Eyes' vantage point she can see through the open

door as Lucky's strapped down.

EXT. GEN-SYS GROUNDS - SAME

Will - dressed in an ill-fitting suit off the rack, hair

brushed in an attempt at neatness - meets STEVEN JACOBS as he

steps from a beautiful BLACK JAGUAR.

You could at least try to look

excited.

10.

Will's too nervous to look excited. He eyes the FOUR SUITS

disembarking from nearby TOWN CARS.

I'm not good with this stuff.

Jacobs puts a hand on Will's back, leads him inside.

You'll do fine. Just speak

English. Keep the science simple.

INT. LAB - SAME

From the back of her cage, Bright Eyes watches through the

open door as the ape on the table convulses.

Okay. Back it out...

Your turn.

Bright Eyes RUSHES FORWARD, HER HANDS GRIPPING THE BARS SO

DONNIE CAN'T OPEN THE CAGE.

C'mon - Let go -

She understands what he wants but she won't do it. THAT'S

WHEN HE NOTICES: HER HANDS ARE BLOODY.

four!

Franklin looks over - he's still dealing with Lucky on the

table...

Be right over -

Donnie looks closely at Bright Eyes. There's something

different in her face today. Rage? Force of will?

What's the matter with you?

INT. BOARDROOM - SAME

Will stands at the head of a table. A BIG PLASMA SCREEN

behind him shows a BLOW UP OF A BRAIN SCAN. As Will speaks,

he gestures at it with a LASER POINTER.

11.

Alzheimer's affects the entire

neocortex, the hippocampus, and

large subcortical regions of the

brain...

INT. LAB - SAME

Donnie and Bright Eyes are at a standoff. Once more he tries

to open the cage, once more she yanks it shut.

Again he tries... and is taken by surprise when SHE GRABS HIS

HAND AND PULLS IT THROUGH THE BARS.

Hey!!!

Now Donnie's smashed up against the bars. Hard. The other

apes begin to SCREECH.

Donnie hasn't panicked quite yet, but he's about to.

Someone get her off of me!

Hang on -

Franklin struggles to hold onto Lucky as Caroline hurries

over. He eyes the chimps in their cages - GOING CRAZY.

INT. BOARDROOM - DAY

board members - they're lost.

In the past, it's been impossible

to target specific areas, both

because of the Blood Brain Barrier -

Jacobs stands, interrupting Will.

What Dr. Rodman has done is to

invent a virus that can, for the

first time, cross the membrane that

protects the brain and deliver a

genetic, therapeutic, payload.

12.

(trying to sell)

This 'payload' would directly

affect the areas of memory, higher

function - and, of course, the

motherlode: intelligence.

The board members stare, trying to comprehend.

Meaning?

Meaning.

(deep breath here)

If Phase 2 goes as planned, we're

effect.

INT. LAB - DAY

She's breaking my hand!

Let go, Bright Eyes! You're

hurting him!

She tries to help pull Donnie away.

Let go!

In the next room Franklin's having troubles of his own.

LUCKY - RILED UP FROM THE COMMOTION IN BRIGHT EYES' CAGE AND

THE SCREAMING FROM THE OTHER CHIMPS - BREAKS AWAY.

HE CRASHES OUT OF THE LAB, DRAGGING HIS LEASH.

Lucky no! Stop!

Hit the alarm!

Caroline lunges to an ALARM BUTTON and pounds it.

DONNIE'S SCREAMS BECOME OTHERWORLDLY AS WE GO TO...

13.

INT. LAB SECURITY ROOM - SAME

LOUD BEEPING as two GUARDS look to a BLACK AND WHITE SCREEN

of a corridor. They see Lucky dragging his leash as he

scampers - unattended - down the hall.

Uh oh.

Guard #2 turns to another screen - where DONNIE IS VISIBLE IN

SILENT AGONY, PUSHED UP AGAINST THE CAGE, CAROLINE TRYING TO

GET HIM FREE.

Hey, Len...?

Bright eyes is pulling Donnie's arm right from its socket...

Donnie falls to the floor at Caroline's feet...

EXT. GEN-SYS GROUNDS - DAY

Lucky BURSTS from the lab building and runs across the

grounds. He leaps over a car, then heads for the nearest

building.

INT. BOARDROOM - DAY

The room is still thrumming with the excitement of Will's

pronouncement.

What about the safety of the virus?

most stable -

A COMMOTION outside. Someone SCREAMS.

Then a BLACK BLUR as LUCKY CRASHES THROUGH THE GLASS WINDOW.

NO!

Lucky turns on Will with a growl, lurching toward him and

pinning him to the wall. It happens fast.

The chimpanzee opens his powerful jaw, exposing DEADLY

INCISORS...

a BAM! BAM! BAM! Security Guard #1 SHOOTS LUCKY IN THE BACK.

The chimp turns, leaps for the Guard - who FIRES again.

14.

Will watches as the chimp - and all of Will's dreams -

collapses on the boardroom table.

EXT. GEN-SYS GROUNDS - NIGHT

and two CDC (CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL) VANS.

Will - face cut, clothing torn - finishes with a DETECTIVE

and walks through the chaotic aftermath. He watches Caroline

walk alongside a stretcher carrying Donnie, his shoulder

packed in ice.

He spots Jacobs, who looks wrecked. He hurries over to him.

Are they gone?

Long gone.

Will knows the answer, but has to ask anyway.

Did they say anything before they

left? I mean, about Phase 2.

Look around you, for Christ sakes.

We'll be lucky if we don't go to

jail.

Will's gutted - devastated.

But we're so close.

You think you're the only one who's

got something at stake here? I've

got my own skin in this game!

What happened had nothing to do

with the 112.

(desperate to clarify)

Take an already aggressive animal,

make it smarter - you're going to

get a potentially dangerous

15.

What makes you so damned positive

about that?

(pauses for emphasis)

What if this drug does things you

don't understand? Are you going to

take responsibility for that?

Because I'm sure as hell not going

to.

Here Will hesitates.

We're not ready for human trials.

Hell, we weren't ready for monkey

trials.

They're apes.

This is what we're going to do:

You're taking a sabbatical. I'll

let the board handle the lawsuit.

When this blows over I'll bring you

back and we'll start over - we'll

do it right this time. With mice.

Tiny mice that can't hurt anybody.

Will finds to his dismay that he's got nothing to say.

INT. LAB REFRIGERATION ROOM - NIGHT

Will stands at the fringes of the room, watching MEN IN

HAZMAT SUITS pull down SHELVES OF METAL CANISTERS LABELED ADV

112.

His work - destroyed.

EXT. BACK LOT, BEHIND THE LAB - NIGHT

Will climbs into his truck and pauses. He reaches into a

jacket pocket and brings out a VIAL - IT'S THE VIAL of 112 HE

USED IN THE PRESENTATION - THE ONLY REMAINING ONE.

TAP AT THE WINDOW. Franklin's face appears.

Will shoves the VIAL back into his pocket, rolls down the

window.

Show you something, boss?

16.

I don't work here anymore,

Franklin.

I just put down fifteen animals,

Dr. Rodman. The least you could do

is give me a moment of your time.

Will's shoulders sag with exhaustion. It's been a long,

devastating day.

of course.

INT. PRIMATE LAB - NIGHT

The cages are empty, the doors open. Will notes used

SYRINGES on the table, filled body bags lined up on the

floor.

It's a creepy, horrible scene.

They're all gone.

I'm sorry, Franklin. Genuinely

sorry...

What's he got to do to get the hell out of there?

Franklin ignores him, steps inside Bright Eyes' cage. He

moves to the very back and pulls aside a blanket.

At first Will doesn't understand what he's looking at. The

lighting's dim and the thing's so small...

But then IT MOVES AND WILL REALIZES HE'S LOOKING AT AN INFANT

CHIMPANZEE.

Will stares at it for a long moment, his brain overloaded.

It's impossible. How could a full-

term gestation go unnoticed?

They carry small. Must have been

pregnant when they brought her in.

Will tries to get his mind around the situation.

17.

Who else knows about this?

No one.

I'd bring him home, but my brother-

in-law works for security. He'd

rat me out in a second.

That's when will realizes.

You want me to take him?

He's an orphan now.

I could be thrown in jail. He's a

chimpanzee who's been exposed to a

possibly dangerous drug.

You don't believe that.

Doesn't matter what I believe.

Just for a couple days. Until I

can find a sanctuary.

That's not possible.

I heard you outside, fighting to

keep them alive.

I was talking about the work, my

she was just trying to protect him.

What?

18.

Bright Eyes - the mother. That's

why she wouldn't let anyone into

her cage.

Will looks down at the helpless baby.

I'm sorry, Franklin - I'm sorry -

but there's nothing I can do here.

He's got to be put down like the

others.

Tell you what, Doc.

(producing a syringe)

I'm done for the day. So you be my

guest.

Franklin hands the LONG NEEDLE to Will.

It's quiet. Will can hear the baby's WHEEZY breath. He

enters the cage kneels beside it, regards his tiny body, his

little hands.

Will readies the needle, brings it close to the chimp's

belly... but there's no way he can go through with this.

Angrily Will tosses the needle aside. Turns to Franklin, who

watches from outside the cage.

Two days. Then you have to figure

it out.

INT. WALMART - NIGHT

A BOX OF DIAPERS pulled from the shelf and tossed into a

cart.

Will moves down the aisle in a daze, the baby chimp - covered

in a blanket - plastered to his chest.

He stops at the powdered formulas, overwhelmed by the array

of choices.

INT. WALMART CHECK OUT - NIGHT

A TEEN rings up the baby goods.

Hey man. Congratulations.

19.

Huh?

Oh. Thanks.

EXT. WILL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Will pulls up in his truck.

EXT. FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

Will's coat is pulled forward to shield the baby at his

chest. He barely has the key in the lock when Irena opens

the door.

It's Friday night. I had a date.

I'm sorry - there was -

She doesn't wait to hear his excuse, just moves down the

walk, her footfalls pointed and angry.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

Will dumps the baby goods on the counter, heads for the

refrigerator. The infant's still plastered to his chest.

He opens the fridge, grabs a crisper drawer, empties its

contents in the sink.

Then Will REACHES INTO HIS JACKET POCKET AND TAKES OUT THE

VIAL OF 112. CAREFULLY HE PLACES IT INTO THE DRAWER AND

ROLLS THE DRAWER BACK IN THE FRIDGE.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Will sleeps the deep sleep of exhaustion. A HIGH PITCHED

WAIL comes from another part of the house.

Will sits up, remembering.

INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - NIGHT

Will enters, half asleep, turns on the light. The baby chimp

lies in a cardboard box on the floor and he's obviously sick,

making UNNATURAL WHEEZING NOISES.

20.

Will stares down at the little creature, trying to decide

what to do.

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

Will turns on the HOT WATER. SHUTS the door. Holding the

limp, feeble chimp in his arms, he puts down the toilet seat

and sits.

It's okay. It's going to be okay.

Awkwardly, he even rocks back and forth a little bit.

Will looks down at the chimp, struggling for breath. The

room fills with STEAM.

A LARGE MALE CHIMPANZEE IN THE WILD. He stands at the top of

a tree, an alpha male, eyeing the CHIMPS around him.

In a sudden BURST of movement, the CHIMPANZEE TAKES OFF,

FLYING FROM BRANCH TO BRANCH with tremendous force, a FREIGHT

TRAIN OF THREAT, POWER AND VIOLENCE.

Teeth bared in a terrifying display, the ape easily

intimidates all the chimps around him.

REVEAL THAT THE CHIMP IMAGES ARE YOU-TUBE AND WILL'S WATCHING

THEM ON HIS LAPTOP.

Abruptly he closes it. Looks down at the infant, so peaceful

in his arms.

SUPER: "TWO YEARS LATER"

SOUND of a TOILET FLUSH.

INT. HOUSE - DAY

The chimp - looking like a toddler - walks out of the

bathroom, hiking up a pair of shorts. WE FOLLOW HIM THROUGH

THE HOUSE as he zig zags up and over furniture.

The house looks warmer, cluttered, more lived-in.

The chimp arrives at a hallway, where he leaps into the air

and grabs hold of a CORD that hangs from the ceiling.

As his weight pulls it down, there's a SQUEAK and a FOLD DOWN

LADDER opens from above. WE FOLLOW HIM up the ladder into...

21.

aINT. ATTIC -- DAY

.the attic. Beams of light streaming through a LARGE VENT

TO THE OUTSIDE. Rings and pegs for climbing are set into the

walls. Toys, books and puzzles scattered across the floor.

SOUNDS of KIDS PLAYING and LAUGHING OUTSIDE.

The chimp heads for the vent and peers through. WE GO OVER

HIS SHOULDER TO SEE...

EXT. THE OUTSIDE WORLD - DAY

From up here, the chimp has a commanding view of the entire

neighborhood. A group of CHILDREN rides bikes. A MAN mows

his lawn.

There's a HONK below, and the chimp watches as a TAXI pulls

up to the HOUSE NEXT DOOR.

HUNSIKER - A MAN in an AIRLINE PILOT uniform - kisses his

WIFE and young DAUGHTER, ALICE, then climbs into the cab with

his carry-on suitcase.

Alice clutches a doll in her hand as she watches her daddy's

Taxi disappear around the corner... Then TODD, the big

brother, SWIPES THE DOLL FROM HER HAND and rides off on his

bike. His FRIENDS LAUGH.

The chimp watches, riveted, as the Alice BURSTS INTO OUTRAGED

TEARS and runs after them.

WILL (O.S.)

Caesar! Breakfast!

The chimp turns at Will's call. HIS NAME IS CAESAR.

INT. HOUSE - DAY

Will comes away from the ladder, heads for the kitchen.

The living room floor is strewn with puzzles and games. One

of them has been completed. Will considers it, looks around

for the box, reads the side...

AGES 12 and up. 12 and up.

Caesar runs past, jumps onto d chair at the kitchen table,

picks up a fork and starts eating his eggs and potatoes.

Will walks over, sits across from him.

22.

Please pass the ketchup.

Caesar slides the ketchup to Will.

Thanks.

You're welcome.

NOTE: Whenever Caesar communicates he's signing and there

will be subtitles.

INT. GEN-SYS LAB - DAY

progress. Will - in a lab coat - watches with intensity.

The mouse moves effortlessly through the maze until it

reaches an ORANGE CONE at a crossroads. The mouse stops,

studies the cone.

Is he going to turn left or

right...?

The mouse turns left at the cone - and finds his way to a

piece of cheese. Will does his best to hide the excitement

blooming on his face.

There it is. Restored cognitive

function.

Same success rate as the primates.

Congratulations.

Dr. Molly Stewart - late 20's, pretty tomboy -- finishes

23.

He's right on target. Height.

Weight...

She checks Caesar's ears.

Dairy Queen.

After. Sit still.

What about diet?

A healthy diet. Fruits,

vegetables.

Ice cream.

Will ignores him.

What's he saying?

He's hungry.

Caesar's angling to climb off the examining table. Will

sends him a look - out it out.

He seems extremely intelligent.

How many words does Caesar sign?

Beat.

You know, the basics.

Soft-serve.

I've heard of apes learning up to a

hundred and fifty words. Is he

good with puzzles?

Will hesitates.

24.

He's pretty good.

Well, Caesar's healthy, obviously

happy. You're doing a great job

with him.

(doesn't want to alarm)

But there is an anomaly I noticed.

Like what?

When I was examining his eyes, I

noticed a strange green

pigmentation.

Green?

His heart starts to pound.

Green. Never.seen it before.

She hands Will an OTOSCOPE.

Take a look.

Will peers through the magnification - and sure enough, finds

FLECKS OF BRIGHT GREEN PIGMENTATION - JUST LIKE THE 112.

It's faint, can you pick it up?

He sits down in the nearest chair - stunned. She eyes him.

You alright? Want a glass of

water?

No thanks.

Sure, that would be good.

She gets him one. Concerned, Caesar comes over.

Forgot to eat today. Not a big

deal.

25.

Stewart hands him the glass. He downs it.

I'm fine.

Stewart puts her hand to the side of his neck. Feels good.

Carotid pulse is running a little

fast.

For a human or a chimpanzee?

First time he's seen her smile. It lights up her face.

Gotta remember to eat.

INT. MOVING CAR - DAY

Will drives Caesar, both of them licking soft-serve ice cream

cones. He pulls up outside a store: "SMART CHILD"

EDUCATIONAL TESTING TOYS.

WILL (O.S.)

You have to move the whole tower to

another peg, one block at a time.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Walter's parked in front of the TV, not watching it.

Caesar sits at the table looking at a flat board with three

wooden poles. There are four colored blocks threaded on the

first pole, stacked biggest to smallest, making a 'tower'.

Irena stands next to Will, watching Caesar. There's also a

CAMCORDER on a tripod.

Here's the hard part: you can't put

a larger block on top of a smaller

one.

Caesar studies the puzzle.

Understand?

26.

Caesar's already started. He methodically begins moving

blocks from one pole to another, pausing, backtracking,

getting it right, never a bigger one on top of a smaller...

Will watches, increasingly amazed, as he re-creates the tower

on a different pole. It's easy for him.

Finished, Caesar looks up at him. Will fumbles in his

pocket, HANDS CAESAR SOME M&MS.

He did it in fifteen moves.

What's the best score?

Fifteen.

Will looks over at Walter, who's staring at the wall.

I wonder where he gets such talent?

(eyes on Walter)

It was passed down from his mother.

INT. WILL'S STUDY - NIGHT

Will uploads the MPEG video of Caesar doing the puzzle and

prepares to record an AUDIO ATTACHMENT.

(into computer mic)

At age two Caesar appears to exceed

his mother's aptitude. He signs

over three hundred words. He

exhibits no visible side effects

from the therapy...

INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

27.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Will sits on the edge of the sofa, the VIAL of 112 in his

hand. He's deep in agonized thought.

Finally he takes a SYRINGE and FILLS IT WITH THE GREEN

LIQUID. Then he stands, walks to a closed door.

INT. WALTER'S ROOM - NIGHT

The opening door sends a wash of light into the dark room.

Walter's in bed. He opens his eyes, squinting at the

brightness.

(syringe in hand)

Dad. I've got something that's

going to make you better.

Will closes the door behind him. WE HEAR A RHYTHMIC

SQUEAKING NOISE as we...

EXT. BACK YARD - DAY

The movement of a SWING. Caesar's strapped in it, and WE

NOTICE IMMEDIATELY THAT HE'S GROWN OLDER.

SUPER: TWO YEARS LATER

Caesar's features are more mature. He appears more like a

"little boy" - and his EYES HAVE TURNED A DEEP GREEN.

Back and forth Caesar goes, as high as he can manage.

At the height of his forward motion, he peers down into the

neighbor's yard where, for just an instant, HE CAN SEE TODD

PLAYING BALL WITH ALICE AND ANOTHER KID.

At the height of his backward motion he catches another

glimpse.

Caesar pumps his legs, eager to get a better look...

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Will's making sandwiches, his eye on Caesar through the

window.

(to someone offscreen)

You want turkey or ham?

28.

VOICE (O.S.)

Ham!

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

WE FIND WALTER just sitting down on the piano bench. He

begins playing a competent version of "CLAIR DE LUNE."

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

to watch his father.

The happiness - the relief - is clear on his face.

EXT. BACK YARD - DAY

SQUEAK.SQUEAK of the SWING, the PIANO FAINT from out here.

Caesar studies the harness that's keeping him in the swing.

There's a clamp on either side and a clamp on the back. He

undoes the one on his right side. CLICK. Then the left

side. CLICK.

Caesar wriggles the harness around so that he can reach the

clamp on his back with his long chimpanzee arms.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Will returns to his sandwich making. It takes him a moment

to notice that CAESAR HAS DISAPPEARED FROM THE SWING.

The color drains from his face.

EXT. HUNSIKER BACK YARD - DAY

next. All three kids - Todd, Alice and Todd's buddy - have

stopped playing to stare at him.

Caesar spots a BALL lying on the grass. He picks it up and

tosses it to Todd's Buddy. The Boy catches it, throws it

back to Caesar.

Check it. He wants to play.

Thrilled at the contact, Caesar throws the ball to Todd. But

Todd has an idea, and the idea makes him smile.

Alice doesn't have a good feeling. She watches as her

brother throws the ball to his Buddy OVER CAESAR'S HEAD.

29.

Monkey in the middle.

Todd's Buddy LAUGHS. Caesar LAUGHS too, although he's not

sure what's funny.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Will and Walter walk down the street looking for Caesar.

Caesar!

He won't go far.

You don't know that.

I do, Dad.

INT. HUNSIKER BACK YARD - DAY

Todd and his buddy throw the ball over Caesar's head, while

Caesar jumps to try and catch it.

TODD AND FRIEND

Monkey in the middle, monkey in the

middle...

Caesar's having fun, unaware that the game has become keep-

away from him. Until he NOTICES ALICE'S EXPRESSION - SHE

FEELS SORRY FOR HIM.

THEN, IN A STOMACH-LURCHING MOMENT CAESAR REALIZES WHAT'S

GOING ON: HE'S THE BUTT OF A JOKE.

They're making fun of him.

"MONKEY", "MONKEY", "MONKEY"... The chanted words ring in

Caesar's ears. He drops his arms and walks over to Todd,

stepping close, hot rage escaping from his nostrils.

Todd tries to laugh it off, but the fear's plain on his face.

Alice runs inside.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Will and Walter search down the street. Then they hear it:

a HUNSIKER'S YELL. Will runs for the neighbor's house.

30.

EXT. HUNSIKER BACK YARD - DAY

Hunsiker approaches Caesar with a raised bat. The terrified

chimp backs toward his fence.

Hah! Hah -

Will JUMPS INTO THE YARD AND PUTS HIMSELF BETWEEN HUNSIKER

AND CAESAR. Caesar cowers behind him.

Hold on - it's okay - he's

harmless!

Your monkey came onto my property!

Threatened my kids!

By now Caesar has climbed into Will's arms, burying his head

in. his neck. Will backs toward the gate.

It won't happen again...

Damn right it won't happen again!

I'll press charges if it does!

Will holds Caesar close and hurries home.

INT. STEWART'S OFFICE - DAY

What does he do for fun?

Will's brought Caesar in for a check-up. He's a little

thrown by the question.

Well we've got puzzles, games, a

swing set...

My guess is he needs more. More

exercise, more space.

We'll work on that.

Stewart continues examining Caesar. Will watches her listen

to his heart. Closing her eyes for a moment, listening.

31.

He gets up his nerve.

What about you?

What do you do for fun?

She opens her eyes, looks at him. He thinks she doesn't

understand the question.

How about dinner and a movie?

Stewart pulls the stethoscope from her ears.

I'm sorry, did you say something?

He starts to try again - but the moment's gone.

No - nothing.

Caesar meets Will's eyes, obviously disappointed.

Stewart lingers a moment, certain she's missed something -

but Will doesn't say more.

EXT. MUIR WOODS, ESTABLISHING - DAY

From high above, WE PASS OVER the Golden Gate Bridge, the

link between the bustling city and a huge, green FOREST.

INT. MOVING CAR - DAY

Caesar - driving with Walter and Will -- looks out the window,

extremely excited.

EXT. PARKING LOT, MUIR WOODS - DAY

As Caesar scrambles out of the truck, WILL HOOKS A HARNESS

TO HIS COLLAR and helps Walter from the car.

The chimp looks around at the SOARING TREES. What is this

place? The three of them head into the forest, Caesar

tugging at the leash.

Take him off the leash.

There's a place up ahead.

32.

EXT. PARK/CLEARING - DAY

They've walked deep into the park. No people here. Will

kneels next to Caesar.

Don't go far. Stay where I can see

you.

Will takes OFF CAESAR'S HARNESS. The chimpanzee runs, begins

flying from tree to tree. Will watches, nervous. But it's

gratifying to see Caesar so happy.

The CHIMP DISAPPEARS around a corner. A moment passes, then

another. The men follow... and discover CAESAR STANDING IN A

GROVE OF TREES.

Remember - stay where I can see you

- if you got lost in these woods

I'd never find you.

BUT CAESAR BARELY HEARS HIM. HE'S UTTERLY CAPTIVATED. THE

SPOT IS BEAUTIFUL, WITH GREEN, LUSH BRANCHES JOINING TO FORM

A CANOPY OVERHEAD.

Go ahead. Climb!

The men sit down on a log, watching as Caesar swings from the

branches. Free, elated. An animal in his element.

Caesar begins climbing a redwood. Our view of him is

obscured by the leaves. As his dark form ascends, Will and

Walter become smaller and smaller down below.

SUPER: THREE YEARS LATER

RUSTLING LEAVES whisper Caesar upward. He moves with an easy

grace, exhilarated by the freedom.

At the TOP of the giant redwood CAESAR EMERGES THROUGH THE

LEAVES - AND WE SEE THAT HE'S GROWN, FILLED OUT - THE CHIMP

EQUIVALENT OF A FULL-BLOWN TEENAGER.

HIS DISTINCTIVE LOOKS ARE MORE PRONOUNCED NOW: EYES A DEEP

GREEN, FEATURES SOMEWHAT LESS SIMIAN, PERHAPS MORE HUMAN...

Caesar looks across the bay to San Francisco, looks north at

the mountains. Then down to Will below.

Will's pointing to his watch.

33.

a CLOSE ON A HARNESS. Will has it waiting as Caesar lands

beside him on the forest floor.

Will attaches the harness and they walk together. Caesar's

much taller now - over five feet.

Sorry to rush you - got to get home

and check on Walter.

They approach a WOMAN with a LARGE DOG on a leash - a GREAT

DANE. The dog BARKS, lunging menacingly. The Woman

struggles to control him.

Is that a chimpanzee?

Don't worry - he's harmless. Very

sweet.

The big dog keeps BARKING.

Annoyed, Caesar finally turns and gives him a LARGE,

CHIMPANZEE SNARL, BARING HIS TEETH.

The Great Dane immediately WHIMPERS - terrified - and pulls

the Woman away.

Guess he had it coming.

Caesar watches as the Woman walks off with the dog, HIS GAZE

LINGERING ON THE LEASH.

EXT. ZOO - DAY

Will drives up, Caesar in tow. The ZOO'S BEING RENOVATED -

machinery everywhere.

INT. STEWART'S OFFICE - DAY

Will leads Caesar inside the examination room - and finds

himself face to face with a YOUNG MALE VETERINARIAN.

Where's Dr. Stewart?

She doesn't work here anymore.

34.

Doesn't work here anymore?

Do you know where she went?

I'm sorry - I don't.

Will's deeply disappointed.

EXT. ZOO - DAY

Disoriented because of the construction, Will makes a wrong

turn as he leads Caesar to the car.

They find themselves in front of THE PRIMATE ENCLOSURE.

Caesar goes rigid, staring at a DOZEN CHIMPS in the branches

of the trees - behind bars. They stare back at him. One

CHIMP, a GRIZZLED OLD MALE, STEPS FORWARD - OMINOUS. HE

LOOKS AT CAESAR AS IF LOOKING INTO HIS SOUL.

Caesar's transfixed.

Will looks back and forth between the chimps and Caesar.

Neither makes a sound.

Come on.

As Will drags Caesar off, the apes in the enclosure climb

higher in the tree to watch. Suddenly they ALL BEGIN TO

SCREAM IN A DEAFENING CHATTER.

INT. ATTIC - DAY

Caesar stands at the vent watching the neighborhood TEENAGERS

walk home from school.

One BOY walks with a blonde teenage GIRL, books clutched to

her chest. Caesar watches the Boy flirt with her. The girl

smiles, flirts back.

One of the younger Kids runs by, bopping the Boy on the head.

The BOY SHOOTS HIM THE FINGER and returns to the girl.

Caesar's fascinated by these antics. He wants to be with

these teens. He wants to be one of them.

35.

INT. BATHROOM - DAY

Caesar stands in front of a FULL LENGTH MIRROR, shirtless.

He stands up straight, like a human. Tries to imitate their

posture, their gait.

BUT FROM THE MIRROR A CHIMPANZEE STARES BACK AT HIM. A

CHIMPANZEE WITH GREEN EYES.

THERE'S A PROMINENT WHITE BIRTHMARK ON HIS SHOULDER - JUST

LIKE ALPHA'S.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

Caesar, Walter and Will sit at the dinner table. There's

tension here, but we can't place it yet.

Then WE SEE that WALTER IS STRUGGLING TO EAT BECAUSE HE'S

USING THE WRONG END OF THE SPOON. He clutches the utensil,

staring at it.

Turn it around, Dad. You're using

the wrong end.

Walter looks at Will, uncomprehending.

With care and compassion, Caesar reaches over and helps the

old man, adjusting the spoon.

Will watches. Heartbroken.

INT. LAB - DAY

A MOUSE runs through a MAZE. It reaches a fork in the path,

leading to two different plastic objects, one green, one

orange. The mouse hesitates, confused.

He backs away from the cone.

A LAB TECH makes a note. Will and Jacobs stand behind him,

reading the number results on a monitor.

Will's obviously discouraged.

The drug's not staying ahead of the

disease.

36.

But we're still making progress,

right?

Will tries to tamp down the frustration he's sure is written

all over his face.

Sure. At this pace we'll get to

trials by the time Hell freezes

over.

Jacobs - embarrassed in front of the Tech - pulls him aside.

This isn't graduate school -

there's a procedure we have to

adhere to.

It'll take forever. I need to

start developing a primate version

now.

Jacobs looks at Will. He's known him a long time.

How's your father? Haven't seen

him in a while.

This isn't about him.

He's worse, isn't he?

Will wants to tell Jacobs the truth - he's tempted to tell

him about Caesar, about Walter's treatment - but he can't.

He's fine.

WE HEAR A PERSISTENT C SHARP COMING FROM A DISTANT PIANO.

It's a familiar, baleful SOUND that continues over the

following...

INT. WILL'S STUDY - DAY

Will sits in front of the computer, looking at a file crammed

with MPEGs of Caesar doing puzzles and games.

37.

(into computer mic)

Caesar continues to maintain a high

level of cognition. But Walter's

disease has caught up to the

neurogenesis treatment. Nearly all

initial improvement has been

erased...

Will stops recording. KICKS his desk in frustration.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Walter sits at the piano, hitting his one note.

Caesar passes him, heads for Will's study.

INT. WILL'S STUDY - DAY

Caesar enters, finds Will at the desk, head in hands. Will

senses his presence. Looks up.

Who Caesar.

What do you mean?

Who.

With effort, Will pulls himself from his own thoughts and

tries to understand what Caesar wants from him.

Who.

Caesar is an ape.

A chimpanzee.

No "what". "Who".

Will is taken aback - beginning to realize the intellectual

leap Caesar's taken.

Are you asking about your identity?

That's abstract thought, Caesar.

Caesar couldn't care less about 'abstract thought.'

38.

Walter Will father. Will Caesar

father?

Will looks at the chimp - sees the intensity, the pain on his

face. How to begin to answer?

WILL (O.S.)

This is where you were born. It's

the place where I work.

INT. MOVING CAR/PARKED CAR - DAY

Will and Caesar are PARKED ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE GEN-SYS

LAB GROUNDS, its buildings visible through the fencing.

I never knew your father, but your

mother came to live here. This is

where you were born.

Caesar mother?

She was very very smart. And she

passed that onto you through her

blood.

Caesar strains for a better view. Undoes his seatbelt.

Caesar go. Caesar see.

Will locks the car door.

She's not here anymore. I'm sorry,

Caesar - she died. That's when I

brought you home to live with me

and Walter.

Caesar's getting worked up - he wants out of the car.

Caesar mother...

Will grows concerned.

No. This is a bad place for you,

Caesar. We're going to go now.

39.

As Will pulls away Caesar strains for a last glimpse,

twisting around to look out the back window.

VOICE (O.S.)

Let's see if we can find something

for you on the TV...

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Walter has a new HOME AIDE - a pale, hard-looking older

woman. He sits on the sofa staring at the TV's moving images

as she changes channels.

The Aide settles on a news show covering preparations for a

SPACE LAUNCH. ASTRONAUTS wave to the PRESS CORPS as they

board a SHUTTLE.

The Icarus crew is led by Commander

Colonel George Taylor. This is his

fifth space mission...

INT. ATTIC - DAY

CLOSE ON a crude drawing of an ape. Caesar sits on the

floor, working on its details. As he draws the white

birthmark - like a falling star - WE REALIZE it's a self-

portrait.

EXT. BACK YARD - DAY

The Home Aide lights herself a cigarette, sits down on a deck

chair.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

TV's still blaring, but the sofa's empty.

REVEAL Walter, standing in the middle of the room, confused.

As if he's not sure where he is.

Abruptly he turns and heads across the room... and OUT THE

FRONT DOOR.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Walter pauses on the porch, blinking in the sun. The street

ahead of him is quiet. No one around.

Walter wanders down the front path. When he arrives at the

sidewalk he keeps on going, STEPPING OUT INTO THE STREET.

40.

He's immediately startled by a SUDDEN HONK, the SOUND of

SQUEALING BRAKES, and a car fishtailing out of control. The

car SMASHES into a nearby tree.

INT. ATTIC - DAY

Hearing the CRASH, Caesar jumps to his feet, rushes to the

vent. He sees Hunsiker emerge from the smashed car, unhurt.

Caesar watches as Hunsiker inspects the ruined front fender,

then turns to YELL at someone.

That's when Walter comes into Caesar's view.

He's in the street, afraid, disoriented - while Hunsiker

rages, jabbing a threatening finger towards Walter's chest.

In a flash Caesar's down the attic stairs.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Walter backs up as Hunsiker approaches, still jabbing the

menacing finger.

Look at the front of my car you

stupid, stupid old man! You should

be locked up! Your son's going to

pay for that damage -

CAESAR EXPLODES OUT THE DOOR.

No time for anybody to react. The chimpanzee BODY SLAMS

HUNSIKER to the ground.

Caesar...

Straddling Hunsiker, teeth bared, Caesar pounds him with his

fists.

Help! Get him off -

Caesar... no... Stop!

Walter grabs Caesar by the shoulders, tries to pull him back.

But Caesar's too carried away by his rage - he shrugs the old

man off his back.

Then he grabs one of Hunsiker's hands and BITES OFF THE

"JABBING" POINTER FINGER.

41.

Aaaaaaaah!

Walter struggles to his feet and grabs Caesar again. A PULSE

OF HUNSIKER'S BLOOD STREAKS ACROSS HIS NECK.

Caesar!

Caesar hesitates. Blood dripping down his chin, he looks

over his shoulder and meets Walter's eyes.

Please stop.

Hunsiker uses the distraction. He scrabbles to his feet and

sprints for his house.

CAESAR CATCHES A GLIMPSE. ANIMAL INSTINCT TAKES OVER - IT'S

TOO BIG TO FIGHT.

He races after Hunsiker. WALTER FALLS TO THE GROUND. HIS

HEAD HITS THE PAVEMENT, stunning him.

EXT. HUNSIKER'S HOUSE - DAY

Just as Hunsiker's about to reach his front door, Caesar

flies from behind - his feet hitting the door - and lands to

block Hunsiker's entrance.

White with terror, Hunsiker - clutching his bleeding hand to

his chest - takes off running down the sidewalk.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Hunsiker runs for his life. He looks over his shoulder -

Caesar's galloping behind, in hot pursuit.

He tries to speed up - can't go any faster. Again he glances

over his shoulder - Caesar's closing in.

Breath coming hard, Hunsiker sprints, scrambles, desperate to

escape. He looks over his shoulder-but this time CAESAR

HAS DISAPPEARED. HE'S NOT ANYWHERE, UP OR DOWN THE STREET.

Unsure where to go, half-stumbling, Hunsiker keeps running.

Then, OUT OF NOWHERE, CAESAR SWINGS DOWN FROM A TREE. HE

LANDS SQUARELY IN FRONT OF HUNSIKER, BLOCKING HIS PATH.

Hunsiker backs up, changes direction, runs across the street.

42.

Enjoying the chase, taking his time, Caesar grabs a tree

branch and swings from tree to tree.

with one giant jump, he makes it to the top of a tree across

the street, tracking Hunsiker like prey.

Hunsiker's running out of steam. Caesar swings down in front

of him and KICKS him in the chest, sending him flying.

Calmly he stands over Hunsiker, who cowers.

Please no...

Caesar pounds his chest, YELLING in triumph.

But then he sees something across the street that abruptly

pulls him out of his euphoria: WALTER - STRUGGLING, BLOODY -

BEING HELPED TO HIS FEET.

He looks down at Hunsiker, cringing.

All at once CAESAR REALIZES WHAT HE'S DONE.

EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

Will's car drives down a two-lane highway.

REPORTER (V.0.)

.chimpanzee named Caesar,

terrorizing the quiet family

enclave and mauling neighbor

Douglas Hunsiker, a pilot for

Global Airlines.

INT. JACOBS' LIVING ROOM - DAY

Jacobs watches the evening NEWS.

The defense claimed the chimp was

merely trying to protect its owner

from perceived aggression.

FOOTAGE OF WILL LEAVING A COURTHOUSE, avoiding News Crews.

Jacobs sits forward, turns up the volume.

The chimpanzee's distraught owner,

Wilson Rodman, has raised the

animal since he was an infant.

43.

He pleaded to keep Caesar at home,

citing the ape's remarkable

intelligence.

Will and a chimpanzee? Jacobs stares at the TV, dumbfounded.

INT. MOVING CAR A- DAY

Will and Caesar drive. Caesar's dressed up - khaki pants and

a Polo shirt.

We're visiting a place called "The

Ranch". They have animals.

Real animals?

You bet. Apes. Chimpanzees,

gorillas, orangutans...

Caesar GRUNTS, excited.

It'll be good. You'll like it very

much.

Caesar looks at Will, picking up on something.

Will sad?

What? No, I'm fine.

EXT. THE RANCH - DAY

As Will pulls into the entrance, Caesar's glued to the

window.

INT. MOVING CAR - DAY

They pull into a CLEARING. Ahead is a new world - CONCRETE

AND STEEL BUILDINGS set incongruously into the bucolic

countryside.

A HOUSE/OFFICE, a LIVING QUARTERS, a HORSE PADDOCK - all

cold, efficient structures.

Where animals?

44.

Will sees the PRIMATE CAGES in the distance, next to a GIANT

RED METAL ATRIUM.

Inside, I think...

EXT. THE RANCH - DAY

As they climb from the car, MR. LANDON, 50's, emerges from

the office. DODGE, 20's, hangs back.

You must be Mr. Landon.

This is Caesar.

MR. LANDON

Nice to meet you, Caesar. This is

Dodge, helps me run the place.

I've been telling Caesar about the

animals you have here. How much

fun it is.

MR. LANDON

Yes, we have a big play center

where the chimpanzees like to

climb.

Want to see the play center?

Caesar nods. Absolutely.

EXT. CAGED ATRIUM - DAY

A HUGE CAGED STRUCTURE, the size of a gymnasium. Inside are

climbing constructions, ropes, toys, and, in the middle, a

LARGE TREE, reaching up through the top bars.

A CAGED-IN BRIDGE leads to a row of DARK DENS. But for

now... it's empty. No apes in sight.

Caesar approaches with will and Mr. Landon.

MR. LANDON

What do you think, Caesar? Want to

give it a try?

Trying to mask his growing dread, Will removes Caesar's

harness.

45.

Go ahead.

He watches Caesar - unsuspecting - move through AN OPEN, GATE-

LIKE SLIDING DOOR.

EXT. ATRIUM - DAY

Caesar scampers up the ledges and leaps to a bar. He swings

from bar to bar, then hits the ground and runs for the tree.

EXT. OUTSIDE CAGED ATRIUM - DAY

Will can barely watch AS DODGE ROLLS THE SLIDING DOOR CLOSED,

LOCKING IT.

He braces himself.

EXT. ATRIUM - DAY

Caesar joyfully climbs the sprawling tree until he HITS THE

TOP OF THE CAGE. Branches continue through spaces in the

bars, but HE'S REACHED...

A DEAD END.

CAESAR TURNS, FINDS WILL'BELOW. What he reads in Will's eyes

gives him a sudden, sharp sense of dread.

HE LOOKS TO THE CAGE ENTRANCE, SEES THAT THE GATE IS LOCKED.

HE'S LOCKED IN. TRAPPED.

Caesar SHRIEKS, speeds down the tree.

Other SHRIEKS join in. EXCITED APE NOISES - coming from

UNSEEN, CAGED APES - fills the atrium.

The STRANGE ANIMAL VOICES FUEL CAESAR'S PANIC. He runs to

the gate, tries to shake it open.

It's okay, Caesar. It's going to

be okay...

The words are for him as much as Caesar.

You're going to live here for a

while. This is what the Judge says

we have to do.

46.

WHAT? Caesar can't believe what he's hearing! He

frantically signs, desperate, pleading.

The SHRIEKS of the UNSEEN APES continue, feeding Will's

apprehension. Caesar doesn't belong here. It takes every

bit of restraint he has not to take Caesar out, to run...

They'll take good care of you here.

That's about it for visiting hours.

Will shoots him a look of daggers.

MR. LANDON

What Dodge means is, in our

experience, longer you drag out the

leave-taking, harder it is. On

both of you.

Caesar WHIMPERS, tries to bend the bars apart. When this

doesn't work, he tries prying them open with his teeth.

I'm sorry to trick you this way,

but you would never have agreed. I

was afraid they'd hurt you if they

forced you -

MR. LANDON

He'll be fine.

Will gives Caesar a last, long look. The pain in his eyes is

matched only by Caesar's.

WE STAY WITH CAESAR as Will forces himself to walk away.

Caesar's SHRIEKS build. The SURROUNDING APES chime in...a

CACOPHONY OF PRIMAL ENERGY.

CAESAR HURTLES HIS BODY AGAINST THE CAGE.

Caesar. Hey. I can get you out.

Dodge stands at the end of the atrium, BECKONING.

This way.

47.

Caesar follows Dodge to the far end of the play area, then

through the CAGED-IN BRIDGE. Will's almost out of sight.

Caesar can see that he's nearly reached the car.

He GRUNTS with stress as he follows the bridge into...

INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE - DAY

.the Chimpanzee House - and stops in his tracks.

This is the source of the APE NOISE. It has an open, indoor

area in the center, bordered by cages of CHIMPANZEES.

Caesar's TAKEN ABACK BY THE LOUD, DARK FORMS POUNDING AROUND

THEIR CAGES.

Caesar - over here.

Dodge stands at a cage door. Caesar sprints for it, as for

salvation-but AS SOON AS HE CROSSES THE THRESHOLD, HE

REALIZES IT'S A DEAD END.

He turns, but DODGE SHUTS THE DOOR IN HIS FACE AND LOCKS IT.

CAESAR FINDS HIMSELF TRAPPED IN A 10' BY 10' CAGE.

Stupid monkey.

FOR A MOMENT CAESAR'S IN SHOCK, HIS MIND UNABLE TO PROCESS

THE BETRAYAL.

Then he begins frantically grabbing at the bars, jumping to

the ceiling, searching for a way out.

To his left: the faces of THREE HUGE, AGITATED CHIMPANZEES

pound the concrete floor, YELLING at him. To his right:

THREE MORE CHIMPANZEES.

Caesar lets out a PRIMAL, BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM. WE FOLLOW

THE SCREAM as it spreads out over the property...

EXT. MOVING CAR - DAY

.and finds the Will's car, driving down the winding road,

away from the Ranch.

INT. MOVING CAR - DAY

Will keeps driving, TEARS streaming down his face.

48.

INT. CAESAR'S CAGE -- LATER

Time has passed. Long shadows of late afternoon.

Caesar sits on a bed of twigs and straw in a corner of the

cage, heavy head resting on his arms.

He slowly becomes conscious of a RHYTHMIC SCRAPING NOISE,

followed by a LOUD BANG. He looks up.

In the cage next door, Caesar sees a strapping, MUSCULAR

CHIMP, JET BLACK, WITH A LONG SCAR RUNNING DOWN HIS FOREHEAD

ACROSS HIS NOSE, PAST HIS MOUTH AND CHIN.

This is ROCKET.

He shoves a PLASTIC 'PLAY REFRIGERATOR' across the cage

floor... then SLAMS IT AGAINST THE WALL.

He repeats this movement over and over - all the time with a

challenging eye to Caesar.

SCRAPE AGAINST CONCRETE... BAM! SCRAPE... BAM!

A terrifying display of power and dominance.

DODGE (O.S.)

Okay, assholes. Dinner time.

Rocket - slowly and deliberately, with a last threatening

look to Caesar - moves off.

Caesar crawls to the edge of his cage and peers out.

Dodge and another animal wrangler, RODNEY, move from cage to

cage, SHOVELING PRIMATE CHOW INTO TROUGHS. Rodney tosses in

an occasional rotted vegetable.

The APES enthusiastically receive the food. Dodge shovels

food into Caesar's trough. Caesar stares down at the wet-

looking dog food.

Mmmm mmm. Grade A primate chow.

Bet you don't get none of that in

the suburbs.

Caesar reaches into the disgusting goop and THROWS A HANDFUL

IN DODGE'S FACE. The apes SCREAM with LAUGHTER. Rodney

looks away so Dodge doesn't see him laughing too.

49.

Think that's funny? That funny to

you, you hairy prick?

Caesar stares at Dodge... then SHOOTS HIM THE FINGER.

Look at that!

Infuriated, Dodge grabs a hose, drags it to Caesar's cage.

One thing you can count on: Long as

there are humans on this earth,

you'll always be a monkey in a

cage.

The BURST from the HOSE sends Caesar flying backwards.

Pinned into a corner, he curls himself into a ball, using his

back as a shield.

The water BLAST is relentless.

Eventually, Dodge turns the water off. The two men take a

long look at Caesar. He's left battered and soaked on the

floor.

What about his clothes? Might

cause problems with the other apes.

Leave 'em.

EXT. BACK YARD - DAY

Walter's frail hand runs along the cold rail of Caesar's

swing set. Empty. Useless in the back yard.

INT. WILL'S HOUSE - DAY

Will looks terrible. He's unshaven, pale, drawn. He sits on

the sofa, surrounded by reminders of Caesar - puzzles, games,

etc. The newspaper's unread beside him.

50.

John - where's Caesar?

The old man looks stricken.

Shouldn't we look for him? Isn't

there something we can do?

Will looks up at his father. He's just had an idea.

INT. LAB CAFETERIA - DAY

WE FOLLOW Will as he strides purposefully into the cafeteria.

He's shaved, pulled himself together.

Will spots Jacobs,'lunching with his Blackberry, in a corner.

He heads for him. Jacobs looks up, sees will coming.

Will slides into the seat across from him.

You've been gone a week.

I was sick.

Too sick to return my calls? You

know it was a funny thing, but I

was watching the news and they

started talking about a seven-year-

old chimpanzee that went nuts - and

all of a sudden, there you were on

the TV. A seven year old chimp,

raised since birth.

The cafeteria gets a little awkward as Jacobs raises his

voice. Neither man cares.

He's the son of chimp 4. And he's

smart. Off-the-charts smart.

Because of the 112. The genetic

therapy was passed in utero - from

the mother to the son. Without a

single negative side-effect.

Aside from biting off a man's

finger.

51.

He was protecting my father. The

same way his mother was protecting

him.

We've had this conversation

already. We knew the 112 was

making the apes smart -

I tried the 112 on my father.

A conversation stopper. Jacobs is stunned. That's the

effect Will was after.

I had a sample vial.

You're out of your mind.

Like a chess player, Will lets the unasked question sit

there. And Jacobs is undeniably, voraciously curious.

Don't you want to know if it

worked?

Jacobs can't resist...

Did it?

It was miraculous. Unquestionable

adult neurogenesis - development of

fresh nerve tissue.

It brought my father back.

But Jacobs is confused.

You told me he was failing.

It's just like with the mice.

Alzheimer's is a progressive

disease, you need to keep it at bay

a - you need boosters.

52.

Will can see Jacobs turning this over in his mind - the

possibilities. The money.

Why have you waited so long to tell

me this?

I couldn't risk losing him.

'Him'?

Caesar.

The ape?

Jacobs looks at his old friend, wondering about his sanity.

We've discovered a safe treatment.

It's the payday you've been waiting

for. I'll recreate the primate

version of 112 for you.

But only under one condition.

It takes Jacobs a moment before he gets outraged.

You're giving me conditions? I

could have you arrested for what

you've done.

But you won't - you need me to

build the drug. Here's what I

need: I want you to get Caesar

back.

How the hell can I do that?

However they do things in your part

of the world. Get attorneys into

it. Write checks. Slip cash into

the right pockets.

(pausing for emphasis)

Make it happen.

53.

INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/CAESAR'S CAGE - MORNING

Early morning sun through the tiny window of Caesar's cage.

He wakes shivering with cold. Notices that the other cages

are empty - that his cage door is open.

Tentatively, he makes his way into the common area.

INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/COMMON AREA - MORNING

Caesar looks around. No chimps. The hose lies on the wet

floor, along with the detritus of feeding time.

He can HEAR the APES in the distance.

Caesar tries the GATE/DOOR to the outside. LOCKED. He

pauses, then makes his way toward the BRIDGE.

EXT. ATRIUM/BRIDGE - MORNING

the bridge) he sees TWO MORE APE HOUSES CONNECTING TO THE

THE ORANGUTAN HOUSE - which is empty.

And THE GORILLA HOUSE, which houses only one lone gorilla,

BUCK, who stares out at Caesar. Caesar registers THE FACT

THAT BUCK'S NOT OUT WITH THE OTHER APES. Then he moves on

toward the atrium.

The APES are visible inside. CAESAR GETS HIS FIRST GOOD LOOK.

Over two dozen CHIMPANZEES and three ORANGUTANS roam around

the atrium. The groups don't mix - chimps hang with chimps,

orangutans with orangutans.

They haven't noticed him yet.

EXT. ATRIUM - DAY

Caesar enters, heads for the tree. One by one, the apes take

notice. They STOP AND STARE at this new arrival - DRESSED

LIKE A HUMAN.

HE'S ONE OF THEM, BUT LOOKS VERY SUBTLY DIFFERENT. GREEN

EYES, FACE CONTOURED WITH SLIGHTLY HUMAN FEATURES, POSTURE

MORE UPRIGHT...

Caesar looks around, finds THIRTY PAIRS OF APE EYES ON HIM.

Should he continue to the tree? Go back to the cage?

54.

He spots a BALL across the way. Moves to it - the eyes

follow him. He picks it up. The eyes wait.

ball, gives Caesar nothing - no smile, no connection - then

tosses it to Rocket.

Eyes on Caesar, Rocket discards the ball like a piece of

trash. His look is insolent, an unmistakable challenge.

AFRAID, CAESAR TURNS, HEADS BACK TOWARD HIS CAGE. ROCKET

SWINGS OVER A COUPLE OF BARS AND LANDS IN FRONT OF HIM.

Caesar tries to walk around. Rocket blocks his path, reaches

out and pulls at Caesar's sleeve, as if to examine the

material. Caesar jerks his arm away.

Rocket bares his teeth, raises his arms.

Caesar considers the options - should he run? Before he can

make a move, Rocket GRUNTS, grabs his shirt at the chest.

Caesar tries to push Rocket away, but the larger chimp throws

Caesar to the ground, pinning him.

Caesar struggles to get away, accidentally SLAPPING Rocket

across the face.

OUTRAGED, Rocket SLAMS his hand on Caesar's chest and starts

POUNDING him. Caesar tries to block the blows, but they're

coming hard and fast: his head, his stomach, his chest.

Apes SHRIEK, jump up and down, egging Rocket on.

Caesar manages to break loose, crawling away. Rocket grabs

at his shirt, drags Caesar closer.

He opens his mouth wide, moving sharp teeth toward Caesar's

face. Caesar struggles, barely holds him off - and...

.ROCKET BITES HIS ARM. BLOOD SPURTS.

BAM! A SHOT RINGS OUT. Chimps scatter.

Stunned, Rocket spins around - HIS MOUTH FULL OF CAESAR'S

BLOOD - AND SEES DODGE OUTSIDE THE CAGE, RIFLE IN HAND. He

pulls a TRANQUILIZING DART from his shoulder.

Caesar starts to move off -

BAM! DODGE SHOOTS A TRANQUILIZER DART INTO THE SIDE OF

CAESAR'S NECK - HE GRABS AT THIS THROAT AND FALLS.

BAM! DODGE SHOOTS ROCKET AGAIN.

55.

Caesar rolls over to look up... as Rocket topples onto him.

Out cold.

INT. RANCH INFIRMARY - DAY

Caesar lies on a medical table, NECK AND LEFT ARM BANDAGED.

His shirt's ripped, and he's still wearing the khaki pants,

now filthy and torn. TIGHT STRAPS RUN ACROSS HIS CHEST,

PINNING HIM TO THE TABLE.

It's a small room furnished with meagre medical equipment.

Rocket's across the way, unconscious but breathing,

restrained to a medical table.

Caesar opens his eyes. Takes a moment to get his bearings.

Caesar.

Stewart stands over him. The light shines'behind her head.

Do you remember me? I'm Dr.

Stewart.

She hands him a cup of water with a straw.

Drink.

Caesar doesn't want the water. He signs. She clearly

doesn't understand. He signs again.

I don't understand.

Caesar's desperate. He opens his mouth, makes a LONG, LOW

SOUND. She's taken aback - is he trying to speak?

Can you show me? Show me what you

need.

Caesar pulls at the restraints.

56.

I'm sorry this has happened,

Caesar. So sorry.

Stewart stares at him. Moved at the complexity of his

emotion, the obvious intelligence behind his pain.

I'm here once a week. I'll do my

best to look after you.

EXT. STORAGE SHED - DAY

Dodge pulls heavy bags of Primate Chow from a truck, stacking

them in a SHED. He spots Stewart striding towards him, and--

Ducks out of sight, vainly brushing back his hair.

STEWART (O.S.)

What were you thinking?

oh, hey Doc.

That chimp needs protection.

Dodge's face falls.

You could've gotten him killed.

I told Rodney not to open his cage.

Can't you see how sensitive he is?

How intelligent?

Yeah, no, he's a real smart

dresser.

I want him moved to the orangutan

house. He'll be safe there until

we re-introduce him to the group.

I'm sorry, since when do volunteer

animal doctors make the rules

around here?

57.

Please. Just do it.

Whatever you say, doc.

Dodge returns to stacking the chow.

You're the one with the college

education.

INT. 'VIRUS FACTORY', GEN-SYS LABS - DAY

A spinning machine, test tubes, a giant propagation tank.

Empty canisters labeled ADENOVIRUS 113.

REVEAL WILL in the doorway, watching it all very carefully.

A VIRUS TECHNICIAN approaches him. He's tentative, nervous.

Dr. Rodman - I think there's been a

mistake.

Will's been waiting for this observation - he's surprised it

took so long to come up.

VIRUS TECHNICIAN (CONT'D)

I've double-checked the replication

rate of the 113 - and it's

enormously fast compared to the

112.

That's why we're using it. We need

the drug quickly.

But... isn't it risky? I mean, at

this rate of propagation, we

greatly increase the possibility of

mutations that are out of our

control. It's a highly unstable -

I appreciate your concern - but

it's going to be fine. We plan on

taking precautions.

The Technician pauses, not entirely satisfied. But Will's

look tells him the conversation is over.

58.

BEEP BEEP BEEP...

EXT. GEN-SYS LABORATORIES -- DAY

brought into the lab.

INT. WILL'S STUDY - NIGHT

EXT. WILL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

moment he's too shocked to say anything.

Sorry to drop in on you like this.

The clinic at the zoo gave me your

address but they didn't have a

phone number -

Don't worry about it. You want to

come in?

INT. WILL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Can I - you want a cup of coffee or

something?

No - thanks. I just wanted to let

you know that I've seen Caesar.

Seen Caesar?

How?

I volunteer once a week at The

Ranch.

Is he alright?

She hesitates, wanting to be honest but not alarming.

59.

Yeah. He had a rough start, but

things should get smoother from now

on...

In the other room, Walter and his Aide become visible. Will

follows Stewart's curious gaze.

That's my dad. He's not doing too

well.

Oh. Sorry.

Anyway, Caesar's going to be okay.

I'm looking after him.

Thank you... I appreciate that.

Awkward beat.

Well. If you give me your number

I'll let you know from time to time

how things are going -

Let's grab a drink.

Takes her by surprise. Maybe takes him by surprise too.

She's happy he asked.

Love to.

EXT. RANCH GROUNDS - NIGHT

Nighttime.

INT. ORANGUTAN HOUSE - NIGHT

A repulsive bowl of primate chow. Caesar - bandaged, beat-up

and miserable - picks at it. In the next cage, the

orangutans sleep.

ROCK AND ROLL MUSIC. Dodge and Rodney drive up in a truck,

windows down, radio blaring. Dodge gets out, cigarette in

his mouth, and moves drunkenly to the storage shed.

40 He emerges with two BEERS, throws one to Rodney.

60.

Caesar watches as Dodge offers a beer can to a chimpanzee.

Want a beer?

The chimp reaches but Dodge pulls it away.

Here's a little taste of beer...

He unzips his fly and PISSES INTO THE CHIMP'S FEEDING TROUGH.

Caesar watches, disgusted.

INT. ORANGUTAN HOUSE -- MORNING

A LEVER THROWN OPEN.

Caesar watches as Dodge opens all the chimpanzee house cages

in succession.

Rodney moves to the orangutan house. CAESAR PAYS CLOSE

ATTENTION TO THE LOCK AS IT SLIDES OPEN.

Move it! Let's go!

Dodge and Rodney herd the apes from their cages, brandishing

ELECTRIC CATTLE PRODS. The primates rouse themselves, move

across the bridge.

On his way out, an orangutan, MAURICE - WISE COUNTENANCE,

ORANGE AND WHITE BEARD - takes a moment to check Caesar out,

then moves off to join the others.

Caesar maneuvers to get a better view.

Rocket walks, king-like, among the apes. Caesar watches him

push a smaller MALE aside. The Male defers, extending his

arm forward, palm up, supplicating. ROCKET CASUALLY RUNS HIS

HAND, PALM DOWN, OVER THE OUTSTRETCHED ONE.

Rocket's the cock of the walk - the ALPHA MALE.

Caesar shifts his attention to the GORILLA, Buck - still

alone in his cage, staring through the bars, miserable.

Why doesn't the gorilla ever get to go out?

Then something across the ranch catches Caesar's eye: WILL'S

CAR'S DRIVING UP TO THE OFFICE.

61.

His heart skips a beat. He moves to the bars, barely able to

contain his excitement.

EXT. RANCH GROUNDS - DAY

Will waits at a picnic table as Dodge approaches with Caesar

on a leash. He's immediately struck by Caesar's injured

appearance, but he plasters a smile on his face. Caesar's

clearly thrilled to see him.

There you are! I heard what

happened.

Home now. Caesar home.

He tugs Will away from Dodge.

I'm going to get you out of here,

but not today. I'm working on it.

Caesar's face falls.

Soon. I promise.

Will notices Dodge's ELECTRIC CATTLE PROD.

Home.

Still a question, a flicker of hope.

(kills him to say it)

Not yet. I can't yet.

Caesar realizes: Will's going to leave him here.

First incredulous - then outraged - Caesar turns away and

Wait a second - Caesar, where are

you going?

a Caesar doesn't respond, doesn't turn, just keeps walking.

Dodge catches up with him.

62.

(loud enough for Will)

No place like home, huh monkey boy?

Caesar - come back here!

He watches Caesar's retreating back, Dodge trotting alongside

him. Realizes Caesar's nearly breaking into a run.

EXT. ORANGUTAN HOUSE - DAY

Dodge locks Caesar in his cell. Then moves around to the...

EXT. STORAGE SHED - DAY

of the office... just as -

BAM! WILL DECKS HIM WITH A FIST TO THE FACE. Dodge hits the

ground. Will stands over him, too livid to realize he

might've just broken his hand.

You son of a bitch.

Dodge scrabbles to his feet, wipes the blood from his nose.

That was not a smart thing to do.

Dodge is clearly much tougher, stronger than Will, but Will's

too angry to care.

If I find out Caesar's been hurt,

if he's mistreated in any way, I

swear I'll have you brought up on

charges.

Dodge looks towards Landon's house, restrains himself.

That wild-eyed chimp isn't yours

any more. He's mine now.

The truth of the statement is worse than any punch.

And you're on private property.

Now get the hell out of here.

63.

Forget jail. I'll come back and

kill you.

EXT. STORAGE SHED - LATER

A bag of CHIPS AHOY COOKIES. Caesar - looking morose -

watches as Rodney pops a cookie in his mouth and stuffs the

bag into the shed...

STEWART (O.S.)

Morning Caesar.

INT. ORANGUTAN CAGE - DAY

The door slides open. Stewart enters, followed by Dodge.

How's your arm? Mind if I take a

look?

Stewart rummages in her MEDICAL BAG. CAESAR WATCHES AS SHE

PULLS OUT A PAIR OF SCISSORS, cuts off his bandages.

Looking good...

Caesar makes eye contact with Dodge over Stewart's shoulder.

She pulls a harness from her bag.

I'm taking him out. Thought I'd

cheer him up, show him the horses.

No way.

As she walks to Dodge, CAESAR GLANCES INTO HER MEDICAL BAG.

What are you going to do? Use a

cattle prod on me?

If you're into that kind of thing.

I'm safer with him than I am with

you.

Answer's no.

64.

Stewart turns to Caesar, who's retreated onto a bed of straw.

I can't take you.

(glancing at Dodge)

Maybe another time.

INT. ORANGUTAN CAGE - NIGHT

RAIN. The apes sleep. Except for Caesar.

Standing in the corner of his cage, Caesar pulls STEWART'S

SCISSORS and a roll of MEDICAL TAPE out from the STRAW.

He kneels at his bedding, gathering sticks and straw. Then

he begins weaving the tape through several sticks, binding

them and extending them end to end.

Caesar pauses, sensing something. He looks over his

shoulder, discovers MAURICE THE ORANGUTAN watching him.

They hold each others' gaze, Caesar taking his measure. Then

Caesar puts a finger to his lips. "Shhhh."

Maurice makes no movement, but the agreement is clear.

Caesar returns to crafting the tool.

INT. LAB/PRIMATE HOUSE - DAY

Dark FORMS in cages, illuminated by GREEN FLUORESCENT LIGHT.

The DOOR OPENS. EYES OPEN, HEADS TURN.

Will enters - WE SEE THAT HIS HAND HIS BANDAGED.

The apes watch as he walks along the cages, eyes searching

the dark chimpanzee faces.

EACH LAB CHIMP HAS A DIFFERENT COLORED IDENTIFICATION WRIST

BAND.

Which one of you wants chocolate...

Chimpanzees stare back at him, giving him nothing.

NOISE FROM BEHIND. Will turns. Down the row, A CHIMPANZEE

ARM EXTENDS FROM A CAGE, PALM UP - WITH A RED BAND.

Will walks to the cage, chimp #11, reads the label beside it.

"Koba."

65.

He peers inside. Koba stares back, EYES MURKY AND SMALL

BENEATH A HEAVILY PROTRUDING BROW, DARKENED PIGMENTATION

STREAKS DOWN EACH CHEEK. A SINISTER FACE.

He DROPS AN M&M INTO KOBA'S PALM. Eyes on Will, Koba secrets

it to a "storage spot" inside the cage.

Then he puts out his hand again.

VOICE (O.S.)

Nanotherapy, beta version: Male

Test Subject Number eleven.

INT. PRIMATE RESEARCH LAB - DAY

Koba doesn't resist as Will straps him to the table.

He watches as a HANDLER -- EVANS - moves into the next room,

opens a refrigerator with a strange BIOHAZARD SYMBOL and

pulls out CANISTER labeled ADENOVIRUS 113.

secure. Then Evans hands the 113 to Will.

Will inserts the adenovirus 113 nozzle into a plastic oxygen

mask.

Koba's eyes are on him as he brings the mask toward the

chimp's face.

Boy, he's a calm one, isn't he?

Will tilts the nozzle, releasing a BLAST OF AEROSOL MIST INTO

KOBA'S NOSE AND MOUTH.

THE CHIMPANZEE CONVULSES ON THE TABLE.

INT. STEWART'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

CHOP STICKS digging into take-out Chinese. Stewart and Will

sit in her kitchen, eating. It's clear from their state of

dress (or undress) that they've been intimate.

Because his hand is still bandaged, he's having a hard time

with the chopsticks.

You actually punched him?

66.

I did.

She thinks it's funny.

I've been wanting to do that since

the day I met him.

I don't advise it. My hand's

killing me.

Here. Let me help you out.

She begins feeding him the Chinese food. He puts down his

chopsticks.

I'm going to get him out of there.

I know you are.

And I'm going to get my dad back

too.

INT. ORANGUTAN HOUSE - NIGHT

Caesar tapes sticks together. WE SEE that he's created a

THREE-FOOT LONG "ARM". He tapes the scissors firmly to its

end, finger holes sticking out. Finished.

Silently he moves to the edge of the cage. USING THE

CONTRAPTION, HE LOOPS THE FINGER HOLES OVER THE LATCH.

He tries once. Misses. Twice. Misses again. Caesar keeps

trying... until finally the loop's in place.

Then he begins to tug. Tug. Tug. CLICK - the LATCH OPENS.

He glances over to Maurice, who silently watches.

Caesar pushes open the cage door. MAURICE'S EYES FOLLOW HIM

INTO THE NIGHT.

EXT. BRIDGE AREA - NIGHT

Caesar walks across the bridge. He passes the entrance to

the chimpanzee house - and keeps going.

67.

EXT. GORILLA HOUSE - NIGHT

He arrives at the Gorilla House.

Buck's visible in his cage, asleep on a bed of straw. Caesar

unlocks the door latch and opens the cage door.

He waits, but Buck doesn't budge. He's still fast asleep.

Caesar hesitates. Then he slowly...

INT. BUCK'S CAGE - NIGHT

.enters the cage, edging up to the sleeping gorilla.

From this vantage point, Buck looks enormous, his vast chest

rising and falling with sleep. Caesar very carefully wiggles

his toe.

There's a GRUNT and a WHIRL OF BLACK FURRY MOVEMENT. Caesar

finds himself staring into the huge, angry gorilla face.

Caesar - nervous - beckons toward the open door.

let's go."

EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

.across the bridge...

EXT. ATRIUM - NIGHT

.and into the atrium. Caesar follows.

The full moon shines down on Buck, the tree, the climbing

structure.

The gorilla feels his feet on the grass, savoring every step.

Then he begins to run. He runs as fast as he can, all the

way across the atrium, then all the way back.

Back and forth, GORILLA WIND SPRINTS of freedom.

Caesar stands back, silently watching.

EXT. STORAGE SHED - MORNING

A morning like any other. Dodge goes through his routine:

0 opening the door, wheeling out a wheelbarrow.

68.

He makes his way to the ape houses.

EXT. GORILLA HOUSE - MORNING

Dodge and his wheelbarrow approach the Gorilla House. Closer

and closer to the cage... until they're right in front.

The CAGE DOOR'S CLOSED, BUCK INSIDE. Dodge shovels primate

chow into the gorilla's trough.

BUCK TAKES A HANDFUL AND LOOKS ACROSS TO CAESAR, WHO RETURNS

HIS GAZE FROM THE ORANGUTAN HOUSE.

INT. ORANGUTAN CAGE - MORNING

Caesar senses something: Maurice is staring at him. Caesar 's

beginning to wonder what Maurice wants when the ORANGUTAN

DOES SOMETHING REMARKABLE: HE USES SIGN LANGUAGE.

Happy gorilla.

Caesar's shocked.

Surprise.

Signing orangutan.

Maurice circus orangutan.

More ape sign?

No. Maurice alone.

They HEAR DODGE'S WHEELBARROW APPROACH.

Careful. Stupid human no like

smart ape.

Dodge begins shoveling primate chow into the troughs.

Maurice and Caesar stop signing and blend in.

INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/ROCKET'S CAGE - NIGHT

Rocket sleeps. Pieces of primate chow hit him in the head.

He wakes with a start. SEES THAT HIS CAGE DOOR IS OPEN.

69.

Rocket gets to his feet, sees CAESAR STANDING IN THE COMMON

AREA.

Rocket GRUNTS and sprints after him - through the chimpanzee

common area - toward the door -

Where WHAM! CAESAR WHACKS HIM IN THE HEAD WITH ROCKET'S

PLASTIC REFRIGERATOR.

ROCKET STAGGERS, TRYING TO RECOVER, AND LANDS ON HIS BUTT.

HE LOOKS UP TO SEE CAESAR... AND BEHIND HIM, STANDING LIKE A

MOUNTAIN: BUCK.

Buck raises his arms and SLAMS them down with a MIGHTY ROAR;

Caesar slings the plastic refrigerator aside, sending it

SKITTERING across the CONCRETE.

The chimpanzees, awake now, watch to see what will happen.

Rocket looks from Buck to Caesar. He's beaten.

STRETCHING OUT HIS HAND, PALM UP, ROCKET MAKES THE

SUPPLICATING GESTURE. CAESAR RUNS HIS HAND - PALM DOWN -

OVER ROCKET'S, SEALING HIS DOMINATION.

A COLLECTIVE GASP OF AWE moves through the ho-use.

Rocket crawls back to his cage, defeated. Caesar - walking

at full height - follows. He CLOSES ROCKET'S CAGE DOOR AND

LOCKS HIM IN.

Then Caesar walks upright around the cages once more, making

eye contact with each and every chimpanzee. He exits with

his Lieutenant, Buck, in tow.

CHIMPANZEE HOUSE HAS A NEW ALPHA MALE.

INT. PRIMATE RESEARCH LAB - DAY

Will and Evans (the handler) are wearing hazmat masks as they

administer Adenovirus 113 to chimp after chimp.

Chimp after chimp convulses on the table.

They lead Koba to the table. Koba knows what to do. He lies

down, allows himself to be strapped in.

All routine. Everyone's guard is down.

But as soon as the BLAST OF AEROSOL MIST is released, KOBA

a THRASHES OUT AN ARM, HITTING EVANS IN THE SIDE OF THE HEAD.

70.

Hold him steady!

Evans tightens the straps on Koba's flailing arm.

WE SEE THAT EVANS' MASK HAS BEEN KNOCKED ASKEW.

Will finishes administering the drug. Koba goes limp on the

table.

You okay Evans?

Yeah. I'm good.

INT. PRIMATE RESEARCH LAB - DAY

Will demonstrates the "Tower of Hanoi" puzzle. Koba watches.

You can't put larger blocks on top

of smaller ones.

(pointing to right side)

Move the stack from here to here.

Koba takes the puzzle and ROTATES IT 180 DEGREES CLOCKWISE,

SO THAT THE LEFT STACK IS INDEED NOW ON THE RIGHT SIDE.

Will looks at Koba. Koba looks back.

You've got to take the blocks off

and stack them again, like this.

Will turns the puzzle back around.

Let's see you try.

Koba puts out a palm - asking for an M&M.

I'll give you an M&M if you can get

the blocks to the other side - but

don't do it the way you did last

time.

Koba thinks, then ROTATES THE PUZZLE AGAIN - THIS TIME

COUNTERCLOCKWISE. Ingenious in its own way.

71.

You know what I want. You're just

not going to give it to me.

Koba puts out a palm. There's A LOOK IN HIS EYE, MALEVOLENT,

DISQUIETING.

AND SOMETHING ELSE: HIS EYES HAVE CHANGED. THEY LOOK

SOMEWHAT LIKE CAESAR'S - GREENER, LESS SIMIAN...

WILL (V.0.) (CONT'D)

What do you think of Koba?

INT. PRIMATE HOUSE - DAY

away, across the room.

I know he's smart. But there's

something else, something

worrisome. He challenges me.

Taunts me.

Will looks toward us, toward the bars.

(almost to himself)

I don't want to try it on...

.I don't want to start human

trials if there's any chance of

danger.

What you're seeing has nothing to

do with the 113, Doc. The apes're

just like us - they're complex.

Some are loyal, some are selfish,

some have a good sense of humor.

And some are born rotten.

Koba moves into frame. We've been watching from his point of

view, from inside the cage.

Now we look over his shoulder, where the sharp planes of his

a face frame the two men across the room.

72.

This one's a bad apple, that's all.

A chill runs down Will's spine.

EXT. GEN-SYS LABORATORIES/MAIN GATE - DAY

A car pulls up to the gate. Evans is driving. He looks ill.

Early day today, Evans?

Actually I'm not feeling too good.

EVANS GETS A SHIVER.

You know what: Whiskey, lemon,

honey and a cup of hot water.

Never fails.

Thanks - I'm on it.

Evans drives off.

EXT. PADDOCK - DAY

Stewart sits atop one of the ranch horses, looking down at

the chimpanzee area.

She watches CAESAR walking across the bridge. Caesar moves

easily among the apes, his Alpha Male status clear as the

others make way for him.

Stewart's relieved - and a little surprised - to see Caesar

so at ease with the other apes.

INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE - DAY

ROCKET'S MISERABLE. Dodge and Rodney watch him through the

bars.

Still won't eat, won't come out.

I can fix that.

Dodge drags the hose to Rocket's cage.

73.

Get that monkey ass out of there!

INT. ORANGUTAN CAGE - DAY

Caesar watches Dodge BLAST Rocket with WATER. Rocket doesn't

struggle, doesn't fight back. The harsh jet pelts his back.

INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/ROCKET'S CAGE - NIGHT

Rocket sleeps. The FEEDER BIN OPENS AND SHUTS, waking him.

Tentatively, Rocket peers inside the bin: A COOKIE. Never

seen a cookie before. Rocket picks it up. Smells it. Takes

a taste. Wow. He gobbles it down.

At that moment Rocket's CAGE DOOR OPENS.

Caesar stands holding a LARGE BAG OF CHIPS AHOY. He tosses a

cookie to Rocket. Beckons him out of the cage.

INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/COMMON AREA - NIGHT

Rocket exits warily, on his guard for anything...

But Caesar simply stands with the cookie bag. No gorilla.

No shovel.

He hands the cookie bag to Rocket.

Rocket watches - confused - as CAESAR PULLS THE MAIN LEVER,

OPENING ALL THE CAGES AT ONCE.

CHIMPS EMERGE, bewildered.

Rocket stands with the cookie bag, unsure what to do. Caesar

makes a motion with his hand.

Now Rocket understands. He gives a cookie to the nearest

chimp. Then another one. Then another.

The chimps go crazy for the cookies. THEY GATHER AROUND

ROCKET, WHO PROUDLY DISTRIBUTES THEM. A TRANSFORMATIVE

MOMENT - ROCKET'S FOUND HIS FOOTING.

Now Caesar opens the orangutan and gorilla cages. A moment

of discomfort as Caesar leads the other apes in.

Caesar pulls an orangutan over to Rocket. Rocket hands the

orangutan a cookie. The other orangutans and Buck

immediately line up. Discomfort's gone - now it's one big

a party.

74.

EXT. ATRIUM/TREE - DAY

Caesar sits high in the tree, looking down at the apes.

Rocket's part of the group again, but no longer the Alpha.

Caesar's got his eye on CORNELIA, a FEMALE APE, standing with

a group of females. He follows her movements with his

eyes...

Maurice climbs up next to Caesar.

Why cookie Rocket?

Need strong. All apes strong.

No understand.

Caesar grabs a small twig off the tree and BREAKS IT.

Gorilla.

He breaks another twig.

Orangutan.

He breaks another.

Chimpanzee.

He grabs a bunch of twigs and holds them together - now they

can't be broken.

Apes.

EXT. WILL'S HOUSE - MORNING

Establishing shot. A beautiful morning.

INT. WILL'S HOUSE - MORNING

Will's getting ready for his day. Hair wet from the shower,

buttoning up his shirt, he pauses to pour himself a cup of

coffee, look up at the clock.

75.

He takes a sip, heads down the hall to his father's room.

Someone's sleeping late today -

Will opens the door - and FREEZES IN HIS TRACKS.

Dad?

EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

LONG SHOT of Will sitting at a gravesite service, surrounded

by twenty-odd PEOPLE. WE RECOGNIZE Stewart, Jacobs, one of

the Aides.

EXT. RANCH - DAY

Will waits at the picnic table. He's been there a while.

Finally Rodney appears.

Sorry - can't get him to come out.

He won't budge.

He knows I'm here?

I told him.

Will brushes by Rodney, heads for the cages.

Hey - you are not allowed back

Will ignores him, keeps going.

EXT. ORANGUTAN CAGE - DAY

Caesar sees Will coming. He turns his back, heads to a

common area away from the bars.

Will runs up to the cage.

Caesar - please! I've got

something to tell you -

It's about Walter.

76.

WE FIND CAESAR deep out of sight in the orangutan cage. He' s

heard Will's words.

Will waits. Caesar's not coming out.

NEWSCASTER (O.S.)

NASA has temporarily lost

communication with the Icarus.

INT. WILL'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Will sits with a glass of Scotch, watching TV. Stewart's

looking at a FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH.

Captain Taylor and his crew are

navigating the ship around the dark

side of Mars. Communication is

expected to be reestablished -

I was too late.

She puts the photo down, cuddles against him.

You tried. You worked really hard.

Walter knew that.

Wasn't good enough though, was it.

ANGLE ON THE PHOTOGRAPH. It shows a younger Walter and his

two teenage sons...

INT. LAB - NIGHT

Franklin's on the phone.

Just checking in. You didn't show

up at work today.

INT. EVANS' APARTMENT - NIGHT

Crummy little place. TV's on with no sound. WE HEAR

FRANKLIN'S VOICE through the phone machine.

FRANKLIN (O.S.)

Hope you're feeling better - let me

know if you need anything.

77.

REVEAL EVANS, LYING IN BED, DEAD - a streak of brown dried

blood across his cheek -- as if draining from his lifeless

eye.

EXT. RANCH - NIGHT

Deep night at the ranch. A moon half-hidden by clouds.

INT. ORANGUTAN CAGE - NIGHT

Caesar uses his contraption to get out of the cage. Maurice

grabs his arm.

Where go?

Find Mother.

EXT. RANCH/PRIMATE HOUSES - NIGHT

Caesar slips out of the orangutan house, heads toward the

GATE.

As he passes the chimpanzee house HE HEARS A CHIMPANZEE CALL

OUT. He turns. Finds Rocket staring out at him, wanting to

go with him.

Caesar hesitates. Rocket CALLS OUT LOUDER.

To quiet him, Caesar walks over to Rocket's cage, but as he

gets closer, he sees something that gives him pause: ROCKET'S

EYES HAVE CHANGED.

Caesar gets right up against the bars of Rocket's cage, takes

Rocket's face in his hands and looks into his eyes: THEY ARE

UNMISTAKABLY GREEN.

Reeling, Caesar tries to make sense of this. And then he

remembers the bite. Rocket bit him. He looks down at the

wound on his arm, now nearly healed.

Has Caesar's blood changed Rocket?

Caesar opens Rocket's'cage. The chimp emerges, ready for

anything.

EXT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE - NIGHT

a quarters, past the barn, onto the winding road leading away.

78.

EXT. NEAR-DESERTED TWO LANE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

Middle of the night, only a few cars.

Caesar and Rocket stick to bushes and shadows. They wait for

a break in traffic, cross the highway.

EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN - NIGHT

In the distance the LIGHTS of the TOWN give a glow to the

night sky. Caesar and Rocket gallop toward it.

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - NIGHT

Dark, quiet. RUSTLING IN THE TREES, as if a storm is coming.

SUDDENLY CAESAR BURSTS THROUGH, SWINGING FOR THE NEXT TREE

A moment later ROCKET FOLLOWS.

Swinging from tree to tree, they make their way down the

suburban street.

INT. WILL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

CLOSE ON WILL'S SLEEPING FACE.

CREAK, CREAK... CREAK, CREAK.

WILL'S WAKENED by the NOISE. What is that?

CREAK, CREAK. . .CREAK, CREAK.

It's coming from outside.

REVEAL STEWART asleep next to Will. He gets out of bed,

moves to the window, looks into the back yard.

THE SWING MOVES BACK AND FORTH, AS IF RECENTLY OCCUPIED.

Will scans the grounds - no movement, nothing to see.

Satisfied, he climbs back in bed and closes his eyes.

THAT'S WHEN A SHADOW PASSES OVER THE BED.

It's CAESAR'S SILHOUETTE, noiselessly emerging from the

darkness.

He stands there, looking down at Will and Stewart.

His face is impossible to read.

79.

INT. WILL'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Rocket's fascinated by photos of Caesar with Will and Walter

along the mantle.

Caesar emerges from Will's room and makes his way down the

hallway.

INT. WALTER'S ROOM - NIGHT

Stripped bed, a couple of packed boxes. Caesar stands at the

doorway, taking it in.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Feet pounding the pavement, Caesar and Rocket head away from

Will's house.

EXT. OUTSIDE LAB - NIGHT

GEN-SYS RESEARCH SIGN. The grounds are deserted. A SECURITY

GUARD listens to RADIO in the guard kiosk.

Caesar and Rocket - eyes on the Security Guard - stop at a

spot hidden by a tree and scale the fence.

EXT. LAB GROUNDS - NIGHT

Caesar and Rocket drop down to the grass. They SNIFF THE

AIR, head toward the Primate House.

INT. SECURITY KIOSK - NIGHT

The Security Guard yawns, checks his watch. Over his

shoulder, on a monitor, WE SEE the dark forms of two

chimpanzees run across the grounds.

EXT. PRIMATE HOUSE - NIGHT

Caesar and Rocket arrive at the Primate House. Caesar tries

the big double door - locked. He looks upward, spies a ROW

OF AWNING WINDOWS near the roof.

Rocket pushes a dumpster close to the building wall.

Then Caesar jumps on the dumpster and catapults himself to

the window's ledge. Hanging by one arm, he swings himself in

through the window.

Rocket follows.

80.

INT. PRIMATE HOUSE/OFFICE NIGHT

Franklin's got the graveyard shift. He's watching a movie on

the office computer - doesn't hear anything.

INT. PRIMATE HOUSE - NIGHT

Eerie, darkly lit. SLEEPING CHIMPS stir. CAESAR and ROCKET

drop to the cement floor.

Now they have a clear view of the cramped cages, DARKENED

FIGURES INSIDE. Caesar walks alongside them, peering into

each one, studying the shadowy, simian faces.

A HAIRY ARM EXTENDS THROUGH THE BARS, PALM UP - IT HAS A RED

BAND AROUND ITS WRIST.

IT'S OFFERING AN M&M.

Caesar approaches the cage... FINDS HIMSELF FACE TO FACE WITH

KOBA.

HIS EYES ARE BEADY, A STEELY GREY.

THE TWO CHIMPANZEES SIZE EACH OTHER UP. EACH SENSES

SOMETHING IN THE OTHER, BUT NEITHER KNOWS WHAT IT IS.

Caesar moves on. HE'S INTENT, LOOKING FOR SOMEONE.

Rocket barrels forward, grabs the M&M from Koba's hand.

Koba offers up ANOTHER M&M. But ROCKET'S EYES ARE ON THE RED

IDENTIFICATION BAND - THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS.

KOBA CAN SEE THIS. HE OFFERS IT UP - IN RETURN FOR OPENING

HIS CAGE.

ROCKET CONSIDERS A MOMENT, THEN MOVES TO THE LATCH.

ANGLE ON Caesar.

He's nearly reached the last of the cages, and the

DISAPPOINTMENT IS PLAIN ON HIS FACE.

These chimpanzees are distant, strange. No familiar face.

NO CONNECTION.

Caesar reaches the last cage, where A YOUNG CHIMP, sick,

stares back at him.

Caesar turns away, crestfallen.

81.

He YELLS for ROCKET, and the two of them take off. The LAB

CHIMPS start to SCREAM.

INT. PRIMATE HOUSE/OFFICE - NIGHT

INT. PRIMATE HOUSE - NIGHT

.into the Primate House. Where he stops in his tracks.

KOBA STANDS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM, UPRIGHT.

They stare at each other.

Then Koba LEAPS FOR HIM.

EXT. LAB GROUNDS/GUARD KIOSK - NIGHT

Caesar and Rocket head for the fence. A GUARD approaches on

his nightly rounds.

They look at each other, lay low.

To protect Caesar, Rocket takes off running. The SHOCKED

SECURITY GUARD SEES HIM, GIVES CHASE, FUMBLES FOR HIS WALKIE-

TALKIE.

But Rocket's too fast - in a moment he's out of sight.

EXT. ROAD OUTSIDE LAB - NIGHT

Caesar's waiting when Rocket runs up. They take off

together.

INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE - NIGHT

Caesar and Rocket enter. That's when WE NOTICE: CAESAR'S

KHAKI PANTS ARE GONE - HE'S NO LONGER DRESSED LIKE A HUMAN.

Caesar opens Rocket's cage. As soon as the door closes

behind him, the huge chimp collapses, exhausted.

Caesar walks around the chimpanzee house, images of the night

swirling through his head. Around him, the chimps sleep,

oblivious.

Except for CORNELIA - she's wide awake. Staring at him.

a closes the door.

82.

CLICK. It locks into place.

EXT. RANCH GROUNDS - EARLY MORNING

Dawn of a new day.

INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/CORNELIA'S CAGE - EARLY MORNING

Sunlight reaches through the bars and streaks across Caesar's

face. He opens his eyes. Looks at Cornelia, still asleep.

Caesar creeps toward the open entrance to her cage.

INT. CHIMPANZEE HOUSE/COMMON AREA - EARLY MORNING

Caesar emerges into the common area. The chimps are still

asleep.

There's a CLANKING as the OUTSIDE GATE OPENS.

Caesar freezes.

Dodge enters with the wheelbarrow of Primate Chow and the

shovel. Locks the door behind him.

He hasn't seen Caesar yet.

Rise and shine, assholes.

The chimps wake. One by one they notice Caesar, standing in

the common area.

THEN DODGE SEES HIM.

What the hell -

(seeing Cornelia's open

You sly son of a bitch. How'd you

do that?

Dodge is careful, slow, as he picks up the shovel and holds

it in front of him.

He circles around the common area toward Cornelia's cage.

We're gonna go slow here, alright?

You're gonna go back in your cage,

you're not going to give me no

trouble.

83.

The apes - chimps, orangutans, the gorilla - are silent,

Cornelia stands, watching.

Caesar doesn't take his eyes off Dodge, but his expression is

unreadable.

Dodge reaches Cornelia's cage. He VIOLENTLY BANGS THE SHOVEL

AGAINST THE BARS.

Back!

Caesar reacts, a snarl curling his lips.

Keeping his eyes on Caesar, sweat dripping down his temples,

Dodge KICKS CORNELIA'S CAGE SHUT.

Now he starts moving forward, trying to back Caesar toward

the orangutan cage.

We're going to have you fixed,

Einstein, that's for damn sure...

But first we're going to figure out

how you pulled this off...

CAESAR INCHES BACK, KEENLY AWARE OF EVERY APE'S EYE ON HIM.

Go on. Get in that cage.

Caesar stops, refusing to go any farther.

I said get!

But Caesar doesn't move.

Dodge pokes the shovel at him, then SLAMS it to the cement

floor.

He edges closer to Caesar, grip tightening around the shovel

handle. Then he rears it back, face contorted in rage.

Get in that cage, you damn dirty

ape!

a CAESAR'S EYES NARROW. HE STANDS TALL, STRETCHING TO HIS FULL

HEIGHT.

84.

THEN HE STARES DODGE FULL IN THE EYES, DIGS DEEP, AND WITH

TREMENDOUS EFFORT... SPEAKS.

(with his voice)

No!

STUNNED SILENCE.

THE WORLD STOPS SPINNING.

Dodge is thunderstruck - nearly loses his balance.

Caesar has spoken. Actually uttered a word.

Maurice, Rocket, Buck, and all the apes stare, dumbfounded,

trying to comprehend what has just happened.

And then... they go nuts.

Dodge staggers back.

Caesar SLAMS the shovel in his stomach.

Dodge crumples forward.

CAESAR SWINGS THE SHOVEL UP, SMACKING HIM IN THE FOREHEAD.

Lights out.

Caesar drags Dodge to Rocket's cage and opens the door.

Rocket helps pull him inside.

THEN CAESAR OPENS ALL THE DOORS TO ALL THE CAGES - AND THE

APES COME STREAMING OUT.

They gather around Caesar, who holds up STEWART'S SCISSORS

AND SLICES OPEN HIS OWN PALM.

Then he walks to Rocket, who gets down on his knees and puts

out his hand in the supplicating gesture. CAESAR TAKES THE

SCISSORS AND SLICES ROCKET'S PALM, THEN PRESSES THEIR TWO

HANDS TOGETHER.

85.

He moves to Maurice, who offers up his hand. Caesar slices

the palm and places his hand against it.

Then he turns to Buck - who stands up tall, beats his chest

and YELLS... BUT THEN OFFERS UP HIS HAND.

And now Caesar looks around, as EVERY APE LINES UP, THEIR

OPEN PALMS WAITING.

INT. WILL'S BEDROOM - DAWN

Will wakes, climbs out of bed, careful not to wake Stewart.

INT. HALLWAY - MORNING

He moves down the hallway, approaching Walter's room. He

pauses, puzzled, at the door - which is AJAR.

Strange.

THE PHONE STARTS TO RING.

Will ignores it -- slowly pushes the door open... AND SEES

CAESAR'S TATTERED PANTS LAID ACROSS THE STRIPPED BED.

He stands there, stunned.

JACOBS (O.S.)

Will? Hello? Will pick up the

goddamned phone!

INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

Hello?

INTERCUT WITH JACOBS AT THE LAB.

The animal handler - Franklin - was

killed last night. In the primate

house.

Franklin's dead?

Something very powerful broke his

neck. Snapped it in two.

Could it have been one of our

chimps?

86.

All our apes are accounted for - a

secured in their cages. But here's

the kicker: One of our security

guards swears he chased a

chimpanzee off the grounds last

night.

Will - with growing dread - looks out the window at Caesar's

swing.

Where in the hell did that chimp

come from?!

EXT. WILL'S HOUSE -- MORNING

Will speeds out of the driveway, Stewart by his side. She's

dialing her cell phone.

INT. RANCH HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - MORNING

Mr. Landon answers the RINGING PHONE. He's in his pajamas.

MR. LANDON

The Ranch. Landon speaking.

Hey Stewart.

Caesar? Dodge fed them breakfast

about half an hour ago...

He holds up a PAIR OF BINOCULARS, looks toward the atrium and

ape houses. Can't see anything wrong.

MR. LANDON (CONT'D)

Let me call you back...

He HEARS THE BACK KITCHEN DOOR OPEN. RUSTLING NOISES in the

kitchen. Opening and closing of cabinets.

MR. LANDON (CONT'D)

Hey Dodge - Stewart just called -

WE FOLLOW HIM out of the living-room, into the...

INT. RANCH/KITCHEN - MORNING

.kitchen.

MR. LANDON

She said that -

87.

Landon goes pale. ROCKET AND TWO OTHER CHIMPANZEES ARE

STANDING IN THE KITCHEN.

EXT. RANCH GROUNDS - MORNING

The two CHIMPANZEES drag Mr. Landon toward the Ape Houses.

Rocket follows, munching cereal from a box of Cheerios.

IN THE DISTANCE

Rodney's visible, being dragged, SCREAMING.

EXT. RANCH GROUNDS - DAY

Will's car speeds up to the gate and stops.

No one's answering.

In the distance they can HEAR the PHONE RINGING at the ranch

house. From where the car is, nothing out of the ordinary is

visible.

Will thinks a moment, gets out of the car.

You go get help.

Not a way in the world. I'm coming

with you.

EXT. RANCH HOUSE - DAY

INT. RANCH HOUSE - DAY

But once inside, the level of destruction is immediately

visible: Overturned table and chairs, plates smashed,

cupboards emptied.

Oh my God... I'm calling 911..

Will picks up Landon's BINOCULARS, moves to the front window.

HE SEES: Debris everywhere. Apes free, wandering... DODGE,

LANDON and RODNEY BATTERED AND IN CAGES.

AND - IN THE ATRIUM - SURROUNDED BY HIS CLOSEST FOLLOWERS...

88.

.CAESAR. CLEARLY THE ALPHA MALE. Clearly in control.

Caesar.

Will lowers the binoculars as Stewart rushes in. She's

trembling.

It's going to take them at least

half an hour to get here.

He begins rummaging in drawers, in cabinets. There's an

empty cookie bag, but Will's able to put his hands on a

couple of stray COOKIES.

He has an idea.

Under the sink he finds what he's looking for: RAT POISON.

What are you doing?

I'm going to kill him.

Caesar?

He's dangerous.

You're wrong - he can't have been

the one who killed that man -

There is no other explanation.

A BLACK SHADOW passes by the window. Then another. Stewart

turns. Now there's another.

They're surrounded. She SCREAMS.

Will barricades the back door with a table.

Chimpanzees at every window BANGING ON THE GLASS, wanting in.

GLASS SHATTERS.

Will and Stewart run to the front room, just as the door

CRASHES OFF ITS HINGES - REVEALING BUCK.

89.

into the cage next door.

Caesar!

Welcome to the mad house.

I called Animal Control - they'll

be here soon -

(through the bars)

I just want to talk to you!

Well this'll be interesting because

your freak'll talk back.

Dodge thinks he spoke to him.

He did! He said the word "no" -

right to my face.

What do you mean?

He can talk.

That's impossible.

Then he must have a voicebox in his

ass, because I heard him!

Caesar walks up.

COOKIE is ready.

90.

Caesar - people are coming. People

with guns. You've got to make the

apes go back in their cages.

Apes no belong in cage. Human put

apes in cage.

Will's heart sinks as he sees that Caesar is intransigent.

He means what he's saying.

Never again.

Will takes a moment, DIGS DEEP TO MAKE HIMSELF DO WHAT MUST

BE DONE.

Finally he brings the POISONED COOKIE from his pocket, holds

it out.

I brought this for you.

Caesar eyes the cookie but doesn't take it.

(it's killing him)

Don't you want it?

Never.

They look at each other. Two creatures once so close, but

now with a vast chasm between them.

You went to the lab last night. I

know it was you.

Caesar doesn't deny it.

(emotion spilling over)

How could you kill that man,

Caesar? Once you kill you can't it

back - that man's gone forever.

WILL SEES A GENUINE LOOK OF BEWILDERMENT CROSS CAESAR'S FACE.

91.

It gives him pause.

Caesar no kill.

But...

Caesar no kill!

Caesar SLAPS the COOKIE from Will's hand.

doesn't want to fight. He's done - disgusted - with Will.

He turns, begins to walk off.

Don't walk away. We need to talk.

CORNELIA FALLS IN STEP WITH CAESAR, BUT PAUSES TO SNIFF AT

THE COOKIE ON THE GROUND.

TOO LATE - SHE GOBBLES IT UP.

FOR GOOD MEASURE, ROCKET GIVES THE BARS A THREATENING SHAKE,

AND THAT'S WHEN WILL SEES IT: KOBA'S RED WRISTBAND WRAPPED

AROUND KOBA'S ARM.

Where'd he get that wristband,

Caesar? That's Koba's band...

Did Koba get out of his cage??

a Apes gather around, expectant.

92.

No.

At the sound of Caesar's voice, the apes rise tall.

FROM THE CHIMPANZEE HOUSE Will and Stewart watch, stunned.

C...Cage!

The humans' jaws drop, petrified.

NO CAGE! NO MORE'.

CAESAR FIERCELY POUNDS HIS CHEST. EXACTLY LIKE ALPHA.

THE APES SHRIEK TO HEAVEN.

BEAT OF JUNGLE DRUMS as CAESAR BOLTS FROM THE TRUCK BED.

APES RACE TO FOLLOW HIM OFF THE RANCH.

Will - and the other humans - are blown away.

EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

The pack of apes, led by Caesar, emerges from the ranch gate

and moves out over the countryside.

EXT. RANCH GROUNDS - DAY

ANIMAL CONTROL, AMBULANCE, POLICE VEHICLES stream onto the

ranch.

They could be spread out all over

the County by now.

Will and Stewart - released from the cages - speak to OFFICER

HUFFS. Dodge, Rodney, and Landon huddle nearby.

No - they'll stick together.

They're following one ape. You

kill him, you stop them all.

There's a leader?

93.

Ask him - he raised him.

All eyes to Will.

His name is Caesar. If I can

reason with him, I know I can put

an end to this.

Reason with him?

Huffs thinks he's nuts. He turns, starts toward his squad

car. Will follows, Stewart on his heel.

You don't understand - this chimp

is smart - he'll listen to me

(to nearby JUNIOR OFFICER)

Get on the horn with every agency

you can think of! We've got to

track down these monkeys before

they do major damage!

The Junior Officer - GRANGER - heads for his car. Dodge

follows.

You need me riding with you. I've

got experience with these animals.

(eye on Will)

I can point out the one you want.

EXT. GEN-SYS LABORATORIES - DAY

An AMBULANCE pulling away. Two POLICE CARS out front.

Jacobs stands talking with a couple of POLICE OFFICERS.

(handing Jacobs a card)

If you think of anything else, this

is where I can be reached -

A RUMBLING SOUND from behind.

They turn to see a RANCH APE ARMY heading their way.

Shocked, they leap out of the way as best they can.

The apes STAMPEDE past them and SWARM INTO THE LAB.

94.

INT. LAB/PRIMATE HOUSE - DAY

Caesar and his chimps BURST THROUGH THE DOOR.

No time is wasted. Cages are opened, LAB CHIMPS liberated.

Koba steps from his cage slowly, measuring the situation as

apes around him go crazy.

EXT. LAB - DAY

A stunned officer gets to his squad car walkie-talkie.

We have a situation at Gen-Sys

Laboratory! Approximately two

dozen apes, gorillas, I don't know

what the hell they are -

AUDIBLE CHAOS from inside the lab. YELLING, SCREAMING,

DESTRUCTION.

INT. MOVING SQUAD CAR - DAY

Huffs drives - Will in the front, Stewart in back. They can

hear everything through the radio.

The lab.

You know anything about this?

That's where I work.

INT. LAB/PRIMATE HOUSE/TREATMENT ROOMS- DAY

ANARCHY OF MOVEMENT, BLURS of BLACK FUR running amok through

white rooms, tearing everything up.

EMPLOYEES SCATTER - running for the exits. Some duck behind

desks.

ANGLE ON REFRIGERATED CANISTERS OF 113.

Like everything else in the lab, torn down, stomped on,

thrown against the wall.

Caesar and Buck walk through the lab, eyeing the destruction.

95.

EXT. LAB - DAY

Jacobs, a Security Guard and the two Officers are huddled

behind a squad car. Other Employees are hiding and watching

from the safety of the parking lot. They suddenly realize

that everything has GONE SILENT.

A moment later, LAB DOORS FLY OPEN.

Here they come!

A MASS OF PRIMATES BARREL TOWARD THEM.

There's more of them!

Those are my chimps...

They duck as the apes run by - some of them right up and over

the car they're crouched behind.

car - and their heads.

The apes stampede across the parking lot, where several use

Jacobs' BLACK JAGUAR to VAULT OVER THE FENCE.

The last is BUCK, whose weight CRUSHES the car.

And then they're gone. Every last one of them.

Quiet now, except for CAR ALARMS.

INT. LAB - DAY

Jacobs enters the lab. In front of him is utter silence and

devastation. Like the morning after a huge, destructive

party.

Out of the quiet there's the PADDING SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS ON

BROKEN GLASS.

Jacobs freezes.

KOBA APPEARS from around a doorway. He and Jacobs look at

each other for a long moment.

96.

Once outside Koba GALLOPS OFF. Jacobs can see him through

the open doorway disappearing in the direction of the others

Jacobs takes a stumbling step backwards, KICKING SOMETHING

THAT GOES LOUDLY ROLLING ALONG THE CEMENT FLOOR.

IT'S A CRUMPLED CANISTER OF ADENOVIRUS 113. THE NOZZLE'S

BROKEN OFF.

EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

Four HELICOPTERS wait. Hoff s, Will and Stewart climb into

one of them.

INT. ASCENDING HELICOPTER - DAY

Any idea where they're headed?

Will sees Dodge joining SHARPSHOOTERS in another helicopter

below. He doesn't like it.

No.

They were seen heading north from

the lab - let's start with that.

EXT. PLAYGROUND - DAY

A hillside park overlooking San Francisco bay. THICK FOG

moving in.

KIDS EVERYWHERE - slides, seesaws, climbing structures.

A LITTLE GIRL plays in a sandbox. Her MOTHER reads on a

bench nearby. The Girl looks up, claps her hands.

Monkey!

OVER HER SHOULDER WE SEE A CHIMPANZEE HEADING OUR WAY. Then

another. And another.

REVEAL THREE DOZEN APES EMERGING FROM THE FOG, MAKING THEIR

WAY DOWN THE SLOPE.

suddenly the Little Girl's not so sure.

PEOPLE START TO NOTICE - GRAB THEIR KIDS.

The Mother looks up from her book. SOMEONE SCREAMS.

97.

Mommy?

The Girl's surrounded now by moving apes --- the Mother can't

get to her.

April!

Suddenly Caesar doubles back from the lead. He scoops her up

and puts her down out of harm's way.

Then he continues herding the apes forward. He knows where

he's going.

SIRENS APPROACH. Squad cars give chase.

INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

Fog rolls in off the bay. Will's strapped into his seat,

looking down at the city below.

You see them?

No, I can't see -

Oh my god.

Seated next to Will, she draws him to her window. FAR BELOW:

it looks like a BLACK LOCUST moving through the urban sprawl -

chased by numerous Squad Cars - directly behind them, along

parallel streets...

She realizes something.

I know where they're going.

EXT. SAN FRANCISCO ZOO - DAY

A SIGN: THE SAN FRANCISCO ZOO.

FAMILIES. Hot dog stands and ice cream vendors.

The fun is interrupted by the SOUND OF HELICOPTERS sweeping

low overhead. Faces turn skyward...

98.

A moment later, Caesar and his apes RUMBLE IN. Chaos.

PEOPLE scatter. SCREAM.

Released balloons float lazily upward.

INT. HELICOPTER OVER THE ZOO - DAY

Will watches Caesar moving the apes down the zoo's pathways,

dodging people, jumping over benches.

He's going to release the apes.

Looking to his left, Will sees a sniper try to get shots off -

but hesitate.

The apes are too interspersed with fleeing PATRONS.

EXT. SAN FRANCISCO ZOO - DAY

As the apes pass other enclosures, the ANIMALS GO NUTS.

Lions ROAR. Giraffes run back and forth.

INT. SAN FRANCISCO ZOO/APE ENCLOSURE - DAY

What the hell am I supposed to do

when they get here?!

An APE WRANGLER screams into a wall phone at the Ape

Enclosure. The ZOO APES are agitated and anxious - they know

something's coming.

Suddenly the phone is ripped from wall. The Wrangler cowers,

turns to see Caesar and his apes.

Rocket rattles the door, bares his teeth.

The Wrangler understands - fumbles for his keys.

SOUND OF BOLTS AND LOCKS CLICKING OPEN.

All kinds of apes - Chimps, Orangutans, Gorillas - rush from

CHIMPANZEE. Then - as a unit - they all run for the exit.

99.

By now, ALL THE ANIMALS ARE GOING CRAZY.

Above, the sky is full of helicopters now -- some Police, some

News Crews.

INT. HELICOPTER OVER THE ZOO - DAY

Apes are visible streaming from the zoo and emptying onto the

street.

That's him! The one with the white

on his shoulder!

A SNIPER takes aim at Caesar - the BULLET RICOCHETS OFF THE

SIDEWALK.

EXT. LAB - DAY

Jacobs watches a TOW TRUCK pull away with his ruined black

Jaguar in tow.

INT. TAXI - DAY

The TAXI DRIVER - a guy with a THICK MUSTACHE - turns around

to face him.

Where to, my man?

JACOBS HAS A SHIVER.

24 Marigold.

Want me to turn down the air?

Whatever.

HE COUGHS.

100.

EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREETS - DAY

Apes leap over cars, run in and out of traffic. PEDESTRIANS

take cover.

SNIPER FIRE RINGS OUT from helicopters above - an APE FALLS.

Caesar's leading, running alongside Cornelia. She falters.

Caesar slows with her, concerned.

SHE LOOKS ILL. But Cornelia digs deep and picks up her

speed.

Caesar continues on.

INT. HELICOPTER- DAY

Will's plastered to the window, anxiously watching Caesar's

progress.

Below, the BLACK LOCUST that is the pack of apes has grown

larger, but they stay together, moving implacably North

through the San Francisco streets.

Up ahead, the GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE COMES INTO VIEW - majestic,

shimmering in the afternoon light.

And Will realizes the moment he sees it.

They're going to Muir Woods.

(turning to Huffs)

I'm sure of it. He doesn't want to

hurt anyone - he's just trying to

get the apes out of the City!

Shut down the Golden Gate Bridge!

No - let them through!

EXT. GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - DAY

Cars speed across the bridge in both directions. HIGHWAY

PATROLMEN rush to block the entrances.

EXT. PARK OUTSIDE ENTRANCE TO GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - DAY

FOG.

101.

The apes arrive at the shadow of the great bridge - a

stampeding phalanx with Caesar at the lead.

But Cornelia can't keep up any more. Losing her balance, she

stumbles, falls.

Caesar rushes to Cornelia's side. By the time he reaches

her, she's dead - a WHITE FOAM has formed at her lips.

She's been poisoned.

FLASHBACK of Cornelia, sniffing the cookie. Will yelling

"Don't"...

Caesar - devastated, the rage building in his face.

He looks up as one of the HELICOPTERS BUZZES LOW - HE SEES

WILL. THEY MAKE EYE CONTACT.

Caesar struggles to his feet with Cornelia in his arms - he's

going to carry her across the bridge.

Other helicopters BUZZ low, SHOTS RING OUT, SIRENS CLOSE IN.

Apes take cover around trees and structures, but they're

getting PICKED OFF.

Maurice takes Cornelia from Caesar's arms as Buck and Rocket

urge him forward.

Koba hangs back, watching, fascinated, as Maurice lays

Cornelia's body on the grass.

INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

Will's gone pale.

Is he hurt?

No - not him.

EXT. BRIDGE ENTRANCE - DAY

Two CHP PATROL CARS are frantically stopping new traffic from

entering the bridge and waving exiting traffic through.

102.

Suddenly, OUT OF THE FOG, THE APES APPEAR.

TRAFFIC slams to a halt.

PEOPLE are STUNNED as chimps, gorillas, orangutans VAULT OVER

THEIR CARS, run down the middle of the traffic - stampeding

across the bridge.

Helicopters BUZZ around like flies - SHARPSHOOTERS unable to

get a safe shot.

AT THE NORTH END OF THE BRIDGE

Blocked off by CHP, all traffic stopped.

A few helicopters touch down - SHARPSHOOTERS jump out, rifles

ready, and follow on foot behind SQUAD CARS, FOUR ACROSS,

THAT SLOWLY DRIVE ACROSS THE BRIDGE - TOWARD THE APES.

DODGE IS AMONG THEM.

AT THE SOUTH END OF THE BRIDGE

Caesar and his apes race forward.

INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

Will and Stewart watch from above as the apes stream

Northward, over and around stopped cars.

Tell them to hold their fire until

they get past the traffic!

WILL SEES below that soon Caesar and the apes will reach a

place on the bridge where there are no more cars.

Then they'll be open season.

north end of the bridge, SHARPSHOOTERS - and DODGE - on foot

behind them.

ON THE BRIDGE

Caesar looks ahead - realizes that he's at the end of the

bridge traffic.

Ahead is empty roadway. And the slowly approaching squad

cars.

He looks up at the helicopters, rifles at the ready.

103.

He sees the FOG, swirling in and out of the SUSPENSION

CABLES.

Caesar SIGNALS TO MAURICE.

Maurice glances over the bridge railing. The Bay churns and

swirls hundreds of feet below.

Caesar BARKS at Maurice, who then climbs over the railing,

taking the orangutans and a handful of chimps with him.

Caesar BARKS a command at BUCK - who waits by the last car

with a PACK OF GORILLAS and some chimps.

Then Caesar starts to climb. Shimmying up a cable and into

the fog. Rocket's right behind.

The remaining apes follow.

INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

From the sky Will sees Caesar divide up his army.

Chimps ascend cables, disappearing in and out of patches of

fog.

Orangutans and apes descend below the bridge deck.

And Buck with his gorilla, take refuge in the stalled

traffic.

BELOW THE BRIDGE

Maurice finds bars and support beams. He and the below-deck

apes begin swinging their way toward the.north end.

Apes shimmying up cables appear out of the fog, arriving at

the MAIN CABLE - the thick one running along the top.

They start scampering and swinging north, the FOG MOVING AND

SWIRLING, CHANGING SHAPE AROUND THEM.

A SHARPSHOOTER from a helicopter takes a SHOT.

A CHIMP FALLS TO HIS DEATH. It's a long fall, until - SPLASH

the chimp hits the water.

They keep moving.

104.

ON THE BRIDGE

The FOUR PATROL CARS stop, creating a barricade. The

Sharpshooters line up their rifles, ready to shoot.

DODGE SEARCHES A SQUAD CAR, FINDS A RIFLE, AND LOCKS AND

LOADS.

They FIRE at the apes above them, but it's tough going - the

apes are in constant motion, and the fog obscures them.

BULLETS can be heard RICOCHETING off cables.

Another chimp falls to its death.

Then a heavy patch of fog rolls in, engulfing the middle part

of the bridge, surrounding the barricade. Visibility's

practically zero.

NOW THE MEN AT THE BARRICADE CAN HEAR THE APES MOVE PAST THEM

IN THE FOG.

They're all around us!

Apes swing above them, scamper by them. Movement - WHOOSH -

WHOOSH...

DODGE - nervous - crouches low. He edges backwards, hopeful

of some visibility.

That's when he SEES CAESAR, CLEAR AND OUT OF THE FOG,

CLIMBING UP THE ASCENDING CABLES OF THE NORTH SIDE.

WITH RELISH, DODGE READIES HIS RIFLE, AIMS AT CAESAR'S BACK.

There's glare from a ray of sunlight that's broken through

the fog.

He SHOOTS, BARELY MISSING. The bullet RICOCHETS off the main

cable.

ROCKET, climbing behind Caesar, looks down - SEES DODGE

AIMING AGAIN. He starts swinging towards Caesar.

Another shot from Dodge. This time the BULLET GRAZES

CAESAR'S SHOULDER, AND CAESAR STUMBLES, STARTS TO FALL.

ROCKET REACHES HIM IN TIME - SNATCHES HIS ARM, HOLDING CAESAR

UP.

Then, using all his strength, ROCKET PULLS CAESAR BACK UP TO

THE MAIN CABLE.

105.

BAM!

Rocket's hit in the back!

He and Caesar make eye contact as ROCKET FALLS OFF THE

BRIDGE, TUMBLING TO HIS DEATH.

Caesar SCREAMS, looks down at Dodge, who aims again.

But Dodge is diverted by a RUMBLING - like an EARTHQUAKE ON

THE BRIDGE.

The GORILLAS ARE IN MOTION. LEAD BY BUCK, THEY CHARGE TOWARD

THE BARRICADE.

Like a freight train of menacing power.

Helicopters FIRE, MEN at the barricade SHOOT as they try to

back up.

A gorilla falls... but they keep on coming.

And now, climbing up from below - behind the barricade --

MAURICE AND THE ORANGUTANS join in.

Their sheer numbers and power are unstoppable.

BELOW THE BRIDGE

Koba hangs back. He's away from the action, but the battle

waged above is audible.

He creeps along toward the North end of the bridge.

As the fog lifts for a moment, WE SEE APES SWINGING ON

CABLES, APES RAMPAGING DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE BRIDGE, AND

APES SCAMPERING BELOW.

Vanquishing the humans.

ON THE BRIDGE

THE GORILLAS RUN UP, OVER THE BARRICADE, CRUSHING GUNS AND

CARS.

BUCK'S EYES ARE ON ONE THING.

DODGE.

Terrified but refusing to run, Dodge fires, reloads, fires

again, his face red with the tension of what's to come.

106.

BUCK ARRIVES AT DODGE, PUTS HIS HUGE HANDS ON DODGE'S BODY,

PICKS HIM UP, AND THROWS HIM OFF THE BRIDGE.

Dodge's body twirls through the air -

INT. HELICOPTER - DAY

Will, Stewart and Huffs watch, dumbstruck, as DODGE'S BODY

HITS THE WATER.

Below, the victorious ape army finishes off the battle of the

bridge and follows Caesar through the north exit...

.disappearing into the dense park.

EXT. MUIR WOODS PARK/PARKING LOT - DUSK

POLICE REINFORCEMENTS and EMERGENCY VEHICLES arrive.

HELICOPTERS above.

Will's helicopter has set down. He and Stewart stand near an

ASSEMBLING ARMY -- an amalgamation of 'human special forces.'

Huffs and a small GROUP OF OFFICERS debate nearby.

We can't gas the forest! The

slightest wind would take it over

to Tiburon.

Well it'll take us months to find

them in there.

Not to mention rounding them all

up.

Will approaches the group.

I know where they are.

The Officers look at him. Who the hell is this guy?

Huffs - embarrassed - gestures toward Will.

This man owns one of the chimps.

The so-called "leader". Says he

can reason him out.

107.

His name is Caesar. I think he'll

listen to me. If he comes out, the

other apes will follow.

Sounds pretty far-fetched.

You think you know where to find

this monkey?

Will starts to correct him - lets it go.

I do. I used to bring him here.

The Officers look at each other.

We don't have a lot of options.

Let's give it a try.

But you have to promise me - if I

can get them out, you'll take them

peacefully. Tranquilize them, cage

them. No killing.

Beat.

Whatever it takes.

EXT. MUIR WOODS/EDGE OF FOREST - MOMENTS LATER

Will and Stewart stand at the edge of the woods. They're at

the path Caesar and Will used to take.

She's terrified, trying to mask it.

You think this is a bad idea?

Definitely.

He thought so.

He's never going to agree to come

out with you.

108.

I know. Got to try, right? I owe

him that much.

Will kisses her. Heads off down the path. Then he pauses,

turns to look at her.

Think he'll forgive me?

(can't quite hear him)

What?

Will waves it off - never mind.

the woods.

EXT. DEEP WOODS - DUSK

he follows it.

CRACKLING of BRANCHES.

More BLACK, swinging through the trees. Is it Caesar?

Will follows.

EXT. PARK/CLEARING - DUSK

Will enters the clearing.

He knows this place. Up ahead is the GROVE OF TREES with the

CANOPY that Caesar always loved.

EXT. MUIR WOODS/PARKING LOT - DUSK

Huffs stands looking at his watch. He looks up, turns to an

ASSEMBLED GROUP OF ARMED MEN.

Follow me.

Stewart double-takes, sees the ARMY HEAD OFF IN WILL'S

DIRECTION, GUNS READY.

Hang on a second...

(to nearest Officer)

Where are they going?

109.

Looks are exchanged. Someone grabs Stewart, who struggles

with all her might.

WHERE ARE THEY GOING?!

EXT. PARK/CLEARING - DUSK

Quiet here. Will heads toward the Grove of Trees.

Caesar! ...

He keeps walking, almost there. A DARK FIGURE DROPS DOWN IN

FRONT OF HIM.

IT'S KOBA.

Will takes a step back, fear crawling up the back of his

neck.

You.

Koba stands up tall. Eyes Will.

He takes his time - like he's enjoying every second of

this... He walks towards will, bares his teeth.

Suddenly CAESAR APPEARS, SLAMMING INTO KOBA, knocking him

away.

ENRAGED, KOBA STARTS TO CHALLENGE CAESAR... BUT CAESAR JUST

STARES HIM DOWN.

KOBA - THE COWARD - SLINKS OFF, DISAPPEARING INTO THE WOODS.

Which leaves just Will and Caesar.

Humans coming.

No. I'm alone.

Will pauses - there's so much he wants to say.

I owe you an apology.

Will want Caesar dead.

110.

I thought you had killed a man.

But I should have known better.

Caesar's face is unreadable. Will can't tell what he's

thinking.

I want you to know that all of this

is my fault. My responsibility.

Can you forgive me?

BIRDS TAKE SUDDEN FLIGHT. Caesar's eyes shift to the path.

Will realizes he's been betrayed.

Wait - no -

Will leave.

I won't -

Will leave now.

No. I'm staying with you.

Caesar pushes him. Will staggers backwards, falls down.

At that moment, HUFFS and his ARMY step into the clearing.

Huffs takes aim at Caesar.

NO!

HE RUSHES CAESAR JUST AS HUFFS PULLS THE TRIGGER. THE BLAST

OF THE GUN SHATTERS THE FOREST'S SILENCE.

AT THAT SAME MOMENT APES DROP FROM THE TREES -- IT'S AN AMBUSH

- a COUNTERATTACK.

Huffs and his men are taken by surprise. SHOTS are fired,

but not fast enough.

UNLIKE ALPHA'S BATTLE IN THE AFRICA, IT'S A SLAUGHTER IN THE

APES' FAVOR.

AS THE APES MAUL THE MEN, CAESAR CARRIES WILL THROUGH THE

CARNAGE.

EXT. WOODS - DUSK

Caesar lays Will out on the forest floor. There's a lot of

blood.

Will tries to speak. He looks up at Caesar.

Caesar takes him in his arms, cradles him with love.

Will looks into Caesar's green eyes. He relaxes. Lets go.

Then the life passes out of him.

EXT. PARKING LOT, MUIR WOODS - DUSK

Stewart sits in the back of a locked Police Car, looking out

at the forest in the gathering darkness.

All is quiet.

The forest is vast, dark, green. Impenetrable.

HONK OF A HORN.

EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

Hunsiker - Will's neighbor - exits his house with a small

rolling suitcase. He's wearing his pilot's uniform.

INT. TAXI - NIGHT

It's the Taxi Driver with the mustache - THE SAME ONE THAT

GAVE JACOBS A RIDE HOME.

SFO. International terminal.

You got it.

The Driver COUGHS as he pulls away. Light sweat on his

forehead - he doesn't look too good.

112.

INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - NIGHT

CLOSE ON WHEELS TURNING. Hunsiker pulls his suitcase on

wheels through the airport terminal.

It's teeming with TRAVELERS. Holding on to the bannister,

Hunsiker takes the escalator up.

INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT

Hunsiker says hello to the FLIGHT STAFF and moves to the

front of the plane.

INT. COCKPIT - NIGHT

Hunsiker shakes hands with his CO-PILOT and sits. He flicks

a switch.

EXT. RUNWAY - NIGHT

The airplane takes off into the sky.

NEWSCASTER VOICE #1 (O.S.)

As the ape search continues, a

virulent flu strain has exploded in

and around San Francisco, sending

shock waves and panic throughout

the community.

EXT. CLEARING - DAY

We move along the ground of a clearing toward a lush canopy

of trees. As we get closer, we notice flashes of movement.

Authorities suspect the origin of

the deadly virus might be Gen-Sys

Laboratories - the same private

company from which several

laboratory chimpanzees escaped

earlier this week -

We're still fifty yards away from the trees, but we can see

it's filled with apes - chimpanzees, orangutans, gorillas.

We keep pushing in, closer and closer to the trees. As we

move past the leaves WE FIND BUCK. MAURICE. AND, SITTING

APART FROM THE OTHERS... KOBA.

All of them have eyes in varying shades of GREEN.

113.

As the death toll rapidly rises,

Hospitals are desperately trying to

meet the growing demand...

Caesar sits alone, staring straight at us.

Although isolated in the western

region of the country, the numbers

are catastrophic and quickly

rising...

Push in on CAESAR'S FACE.

Efforts to quarantine appear to

have failed. The strain has been

spotted as far away as Singapore

and Australia...

CLOSER AND CLOSER ON CAESAR'S FACE.

Casualties have reached apocalyptic

levels. Authorities urge you to

stay inside your homes...

For those of you who can hear me, I

say...

God's speed and so long to you all.

The NEWSCASTER'S VOICE is replaced by the WHITE NOISE OF A

SNOWY TELEVISION SET.

CAESAR'S EYES FILL THE SCREEN.
