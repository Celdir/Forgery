pitches them one by one at the bottle.  He misses.

He looks for a few more good rocks to throw and while looking through some

tall grass and weeds, he sees something strange.

He looks closer.  It is a HUMAN EAR, covered with crawling ants.

Jeffrey immediately stands up and looks around.  All he sees are houses

- some laundry drying - a very peaceful scene.  No one seems to be around -

No one seems to be watching him.

He looks again at the ear.

We are so close we can hear ants racing frantically around the ear into it.

There is dried blood on part of it.

He knocks and waits.  He looks around. the hallway is empty.

DOROTHY VALLENS opens the door.  She is a very beautiful woman in her

late thirties.  She has a beautiful full figure, dark eyes, black thick

wavy hair.  Full red lips.  Right now, however, she looks a bit tired and

a bit frumpy in an old terrycloth robe.

68. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Jeffrey goes all around the baseboards, spraying.  All the while he's

getting a good look around the apartment.

There is a window above the kitchen sink out to the fire escape.  Jeffrey

looks around to see what Dorothy is doing and she is watching him spraying.

The apartment is smaller than he thought, so he sprays the kitchen very

slowly and makes believe the sprayer is jammed.

Suddenly, there is knocking at the door.

She opens the door.  Jeffrey looks. It's not Sandy. A MAN, with a yellow

sports coat, is standing there.  Jeffrey begins to sweat, because the MAN

looked around Dorothy to see him.  Dorothy says something to the Man which

Jeffrey cannot hear.

The next time Jeffrey looks up, the Man is gone.  The whole thing looks

to be turning out badly when Jeffrey spots a key on the counter.  On a

There is quite a round of applause, even though most people continue

laughing, talking, and drinking.  Dorothy Vallens comes out on stage.

She smiles. The house lights are still up. As she sings the first lines

of "BLUE MOON" the house lights go down and a blue spot light comes up on

her as she sings the word, "Blue." This is a very sexy and slow version of

the song.

During the song, Jeffrey and Sandy look at one another with the thought

that this is the woman whose apartment they are about to break into.

Jeffrey and Sandy leave as Dorothy starts her next song, "BLUE VELVET."

They hear the first few lines before they get out the door.

They turn in to the street where Dorothy Vallens lives and glide to a stop

close to the building.  Jeffery cuts the engine.

It is very quiet.  Both are looking around to see if anyone is out or

watching.  Jeffrey tries to look up out the front windshield to the

Seventh Floor.  It is dark.  Sandy moves.  Every tiny sound is heard.

Sandy looks at Jeffrey for some time, then back at the building.

Jeffrey nods.

Jeffrey gets out of the car and shuts the door.  He looks in one more time

at Sandy.  They stare at each other silently.

Jeffrey can see her lips in the black darkness of the car.  Sandy watches

him cross the lawn and go into the apartment building.  She slides over and

sits in the driver's seat.

81. INT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Jeffrey hurries up the stairs to the Seventh Floor.

SOMEONE comes out of an apartment just as Jeffrey gets to the Seventh Floor.

He goes up another flight of stairs to the Eighth Floor and waits until

the man goes downstairs.

Jeffrey then goes back to the Seventh Floor and goes to Door 710.

He takes out the key and looks around. No one.  He inserts the key.

It fits.  He turns it.  The door opens.

82. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

He quickly enters the very dark apartment and shuts the door.  It takes a

moment for his eyes to adjust to the darkness.  Soon he finds his way

around.  He decides on the closet to hide in.  However before he goes in

to the closet he slowly surveys the apartment as well as he can in the

darkness.  He goes down the hallway to the back bedroom.

Across the hallway he opens another door and is surprised to find an empty

child's room.  In the child's room he sees a small pointed hat with a

propeller on top.  The kind that plays music when the propeller turns.

The hat is sitting silently on the bed post.  He quietly closes the door.

He returns to the closet.  Once inside, he checks out how much he can see.

Through the slats he has a view of half the apartment.  This is where he

will stay.  He moves around some to relax.  He takes several deep breaths.

He looks at his watch.  It says "10:17."

83. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/LINCOLN STREET - NIGHT

Sandy sits in the car, carefully watching the apartment building and

street.

84. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

In the closet, Jeffrey shakes his shoulders and moves around some to

stretch his muscles which are getting tired.  Again, he takes several

deep breaths.  He looks at his watch - it says 12:45.

Jeffrey sneaks out of the closet and makes his way across the bedroom to

the door of the bathroom.  His foot hits the door and it makes a loud

noise.  He freezes.

85. INT. DOROTHY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

He moves again into the bathroom.  He starts to pee.

86. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/LINCOLN STREET - NIGHT

Suddenly Sandy sits up alert.

87. EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

A car drives up and a MAN helps Dorothy Vallens get out.  They walk into

the building.

88. INT. DOROTHY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

Jeffrey instinctively has flushed the toilet and because everything else

is so quiet the water SOUNDS seem very loud.

89. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/LINCOLN STREET - NIGHT

Sandy begins to honk the horn.

90. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Unable to hear the warning horn, Jeffrey nonchalantly leaves the bathroom

as the tank is still filling.

SUDDENLY, he hears something. a key going in the door.  He bolts toward

the closet.  He flies inside it and is swinging the door shut as the front

door opens.

Just as suddenly, the toilet tank gets full and the water shuts off -

SILENCE, except for Dorothy Vallens at the front door.

The front door shuts and the living room lights go on.  Jeffrey can see

Dorothy come toward him.  She walks RIGHT UP, almost to his face, when

the phone RINGS.

She turns immediately and goes to answer it.  Jeffrey almost passes out.

He thought he'd had it.  He overhears.

She hangs up the phone hard and puts her head in her hands.

She goes and sits down and starts chewing a fingernail.  She nervously

gets up again and looks at a framed photograph for a moment then hides

the photograph under a pillow on the couch.  She puts on a record, "FOR

YOUR PRECIOUS LOVE."  She sits back down and chews her nail again,

listening to the MUSIC; she starts to cry.  She stops herself and takes

the record off.  She starts taking off her stocking.  She then takes off

her dress.

Underneath, she has on a bra and panties.  She crosses the living room,

goes down the hallway into the bathroom.

Jeffrey can't see her too well now.  She takes off her panties in the

bathroom.  She is now naked.  She looks at herself in the mirror.  We see

Jeffrey's face as he watches her.  She disappears from view completely and

we HEAR her start a SHOWER.

91. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jeffrey's face.  He sees Dorothy - in a towel - come toward him again.

He quickly moves back into the closet as far as he can.

She opens the door, reaches in and gets a blue velvet robe.  She doesn't

see Jeffrey even though he isn't well hidden.  She closes the door.  It

CLICKS shut.

Jeffrey is in almost total darkness.  He listens.  He can HEAR WALKING

around, then silence.  He hears the kitchen sink WATER RUNNING.

He HEARS her WALKING AGAIN.  Now he can see her.  She sits down on her

bed.  She looks up.  Just as Jeffrey shifts his weight.  She looks at the

closet strangely, but then calmly picks up a book and thumbs through it.

She slowly gets up.

Jeffrey doesn't know what is up.  He looks but she walks out of view.

SUDDENLY, he hears a DRAWER OPEN, and just as suddenly, the CLOSET DOOR

FLIES OPEN, and there she is with a pistol pointed right at him.  When

she realizes that SOMEONE IS REALLY THERE, she SCREAMS ONCE, very loud.

Dorothy stares at Jeffrey studying him for some time thinking.

Dorothy moves to the kitchen counter and gets a knife.  She goes to

Jeffrey.  Now she has a knife and a gun.  He's scared.

Jeffrey begins to undress. First he takes off his shoes and socks,

Then his shirt.  He undoes his belt and unzips his pants and takes them

off.  Now he is only in his underwear.

He does.

Dorothy has a strange look on her face.  She reaches out and pulls

Jeffrey's underpants down to his knees.  She looks at him.

Dorothy is getting very DREAMY and begins to talk in a childlike voice.

She opens her robe and pulls Jeffrey to her breasts.

Jeffrey's eyes close with nervous ecstasy as Dorothy begins touching him.

He tries to touch her.

She looks at him.

He lies down.  He looks frightened.

There's a KNOCK, KNOCK on the door.  Dorothy looks VERY frightened.  She

quickly moves a finger to her lips in a "quiet" sign and whispers to

Jeffrey.

KNOCKING is heard louder at the door.  Jeffrey picks up all his clothes

and gets in the closet.  He's naked and hiding in the closet.  Dorothy

closes her robe and glides to the front door.

Jeffrey sees FRANK come in.

Frank is medium height and stocky with a burr hair cut.  He is wearing a

tight blue t-shirt and an old black sports jacket.  He's got on a pair of

blue jeans and boots.  He has a raw, mean sexuality - a "bomb about to go

off" - presence.

He comes into the room slowly, always looking at Dorothy.  He sits on the

couch.

Dorothy goes into the kitchen to get Frank his drink.  As she passes the

closet, Jeffrey can see the fear in her face.

She returns with a small glass of bourbon and hands it to Frank.  Frank

sips on it.

Dorothy brings a small chair over from the wall and sits down.  She

adjusts her robe.

Dorothy slowly spreads her legs.  She can see Jeffrey staring out of the

darkness of the closet at her.

She opens her legs wider.  Frank looks at her crotch and drinks his

bourbon.  He stares at the floor for a moment, then slowly looks back at

Dorothy, her body - her crotch.

Dorothy looks up at the ceiling, waiting.  Frank suddenly reaches to his

belt, where he has a small canister and a mask.  He opens a valve on the

canister and places the mask over his nose and mouth.  The canister is

filled with helium, which makes Frank's voice very high and strange

sounding.  The result is frightening.

Dorothy jumps.  She keeps looking at the ceiling.

Then, Frank's voice goes to normal.

Frank goes to Dorothy and kneels down in front of her.  He takes one more

gasp of helium.

Dorothy opens her robe and gives a part of the robe to Frank.

Frank slowly moves

Frank slowly moves his mouth to the robe and runs his lips along the

texture of the velvet.  His hands rub the velvet and feel Dorothy's body

underneath.  His hands start feeling her breasts as he sucks and bites the

velvet robe.

Dorothy is very frightened but she is getting hot in spite of her fear.

Then Frank, in a sort of sickening way, pulls Dorothy down to rug.  He

warns her.

He begins stuffing part of the robe into her mouth.  Then, he pushes her

arms back and she keeps them back, letting Frank have his way.  Frank

sucks and bites the velvet coming out of her mouth, while he pinches and

feels her breasts in a strange, compulsive, timidly sickening way.

Dorothy is moaning.  Frank is breathing very heavily. He feels her crotch.

He starts stuffing the robe in his mouth now and he gets on top of Dorothy.

He starts humping her and pulling her nude body up and down him.  Faster

and faster, then he has a climax in his pants.  Dorothy's head is falling

back.  She can see Jeffrey blurred in the distance - in the closet.

Cautiously, she looks sideways at Frank.

He slugs her in the face.  His nose is running and he's stifling sobs from

deep within him.  On his hands and knees, he moves away.  The robe pulls

out of his mouth.  His breathing is even heavier now.  He stands and

begins to move around the apartment.  He goes to a wall, turns off the

lights, then turns and walks into the bathroom, all the while breathing

big, heavy breaths, trying to stop the crying.  Dorothy moans softly.

It gets very quiet and still for a moment.  Then, Jeffrey hears Frank

with his high helium voice talking to himself in the bathroom.  The high,

strange sound reverberates in the distance.  Jeffrey can't make it out -

soon, he hears Frank's high laughing.  Frank comes back into the living

room.  The mask is around his face.  All his breathing - every sound is

high . He laughs a little and crosses the darkened room to the door.

Frank leaves and shuts the door.  The apartment is silent except for

Dorothy's moans.

Jeffrey is stunned.  He doesn't move.  He watches Dorothy in the

half-light.  She rolls over and starts crying.  The crying is deep and

genuine.

Slowly, Jeffrey emerges from the closet and goes to her.  He bends down

and touches her.  She flinches and turns to see him.  She turns back

sobbing.  He tries to get her up.

She struggles up with Jeffrey's help and he takes her over to the bed.

She falls down on her side, turned toward the wall.  He covers her with

the sheet.

He starts to put on his underwear.  They're inside out.  He tries to turn

them around.

Jeffrey turns to her.  He studies her.  He reaches out and takes her

shoulders.  He moves down and holds her.

They lie together for a long silent moment.

Jeffrey looks.

Jeffrey starts to move closer.  Dorothy closes her eyes.

Jeffrey can't help himself.  He licks and sucks her nipples and feels her

breasts.  They both are getting very hot.

Jeffrey is all over her now.  Dorothy suddenly seems to recognize him.

Dorothy arches back and whining she throws her head back hard against the

wall.

She moves and won't let him feel her anymore.  She holds his hands away.

They start making love.  Suddenly, Dorothy starts crying.

Suddenly Dorothy slaps Jeffrey in the face. very hard.

Jeffrey gets off her, pressing his hand to his face.  Dorothy goes into

the bathroom crying all the way.  Jeffrey sits, confused.

Suddenly Jeffrey hears a horrible scream from Dorothy.  A true scream of

horror.  He rushes into the bathroom to see what is wrong.

92. INT. DOROTHY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

She is just flushing something down the toilet.  The water SOUND rushes.

He turns to her.  She is trembling and in a state of shock.

He looks in the swirling water. It looks like an ear revolving around and

around then whatever it is disappears.

Jeffrey looks up. he sees written with a bar of soap the words "look down"

on the mirror.

He looks down into the sink.  At the bottom he sees a small clot of blood

and a smear of fresher blood.

Jeffrey suddenly remembers mentally Frank's high helium voice reverberating

in the bathroom.

93. INT. DOROTHY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

FLASHBACK

Frank in bathroom.

94. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

FLASHBACK

Frank at door saying "see you next Christmas."

95. INT. DOROTHY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

He takes another look at the blood in the bottom of the sink.  He takes

another look at the beautiful dark troubled eyes of Dorothy Vallens, and

turns, goes through the hall to the living room.  He crosses slowly to the

door, suddenly he turns back and enters the hallway going down to the

bathroom.  He stops and looks at Dorothy who is turned away from him.

She stares into the sink.  Jeffrey notices that a square of fabric has

been cut from the bottom of her blue velvet robe

She is whispering something to herself.

Jeffrey doesn't know what he can do.

96. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jeffrey turns back, goes through the living room.  He looks around and

sees the empty bourbon glass of Frank's.  Suddenly he remembers the

photograph that Dorothy hid.  He picks up the pillow and sees a picture

of a smiling man and a small boy standing next to him wearing a pointed

hat with a propeller. He turns the photo over and finds an old marriage

license.  It reads: Dorothy Vallens to Don.

He hides the photo again.  He sees Dorothy's telephone.  He memorizes the

number - moving his lips with each digit.  He goes to the front door and

opens it quietly.

97. EXT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

He looks out into the hall.  It's empty.

97A. INT. HALLWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

He quickly goes to the back stairway and down the stairs.  These steps are

cement and his feet make echoing sounds which seem very loud.  He goes

through a door marked "EXIT".

98. EXT. LINCOLN STREET - NIGHT

. and comes out, crosses a lawn and goes out onto the sidewalk.

He walks along taking in deep cleansing breaths.  He looks at his watch.

2:30.  He feels so confused, exhilarated, so uneasy.  He secretly worries

about what he's gotten into.

99. INT. BEAUMONTS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Jeffrey enters the house. THE CAMERA RUSHES along the rug in the dark to a

foot.  The lights come on.  PAN UP the leg to Mrs. Beaumont waiting in a

chair, staring.

102. INT. HOSPITAL LABORATORY - DAY

The searching, mysterious MUSIC plays over while,

A DOCTOR is looking at various blood samples under a powerful microscope.

Various sophisticated gadgets are seen in CLOSEUPS.

The Doctor makes a change in magnification.  The cells are huge - then,

even bigger.  They are so big we can hear them moving.

103. EXT. "SLOW CLUB" - NIGHT

The parking lot is half-full.  A strong wind is blowing trash around.

Jeffrey parks his car.

104. INT. "SLOW CLUB" - NIGHT

. and enters the club. He speaks to the Maitre d'.

Dorothy is singing her opening song as the Maitre d' seats Jeffrey.

Jeffrey surveys the place after the Maitre d' leaves.  It is very dark and

smoky inside.  He has trouble seeing, but suddenly he spots Frank sitting

with some other GUYS watching Dorothy sing.  They are sitting two tables

away.

Frank is totally captivated by Dorothy's singing and is very serious-

looking.  He looks right up to her eyes.  In his hand he works a small

piece of blue velvet cloth with his fingers.  Again her first number,

"BLUE MOON," segues into "BLUE VELVET."  This song she sings mainly to

Frank.  When it is over Frank continues watching Dorothy and everyone else

applauds loudly.

Jeffrey drinks up his Heineken and goes back outside.

EXT. "SLOW CLUB" - NIGHT

He looks around at all the cars but none stand out as Frank's.  He gets

into his car and pulls out across the street, re-parks the car and waits.

106. EXT. "SLOW CLUB" - NIGHT

Traffic roars past Jeffrey and in the distance several people exit the

SLOW CLUB.  Among them are Frank and his friends.  They get into a black

Ford Fairlane and drive out of the parking lot - down the highway.

Jeffrey starts his engine and moves out after them.  He has to gun the car

up to sixty-five to catch up with them.

107. EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT

The mysterious MUSIC plays.

He follows them to an intersection where they turn off to the right.

He waits at a light right behind them.  Inside they are lighting

cigarettes.  The light turns green and Frank takes off.  Jeffrey follows

them through a dark area down by the docks.  He follows them up a narrow

street through dark factories.

108. EXT. FRONT STREET - NIGHT

Dark, low MUSIC now.

Up ahead, Frank parks his car.  Jeffrey quickly pulls over and kills his

lights and engine.  He watches Frank and his friends enter an old apartment

building next to a bookbinding factory.  They disappear within.  The

electric lines above buzz loudly.

Jeffrey gets out of his car and walks up the deserted street.  He reaches

Frank's car which is making popping and clicking NOISES as it cools down.

He looks at the license plates - walks a few paces ahead and then writes it

down in his notebook.  He continues on to the apartment building.

109. 	INT. LOBBY - FRANK'S BUILDING - NIGHT

Inside he looks at the names on the mailboxes.  He sees a name - Frank

Booth.  The name gives him the chills.  The apartment number is 26.

Jeffrey discreetly parks just after Frank kills the engine on his car.

He watches Frank leave the parking lot.

seems to use the lot as a secret short cut to Dorothy's apartment.

113. EXT. DINER PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Jeffrey goes back to his car to wait.

114. EXT. DINER PARKING LOT - NIGHT

A storm is building.  There is a roar of thunder as Frank slams his car

door as he gets in.  His mouth twists into a smile as he guns the engine

and leaves.  Jeffrey waits till Frank is safely gone.

He then gets out of his car as the wind is building.

117. INT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

LOOKS BAD.

They go inside.

118. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Dorothy breaks down crying.

Jeffrey goes to her.

Dorothy looks up.  They stare at each other for some time.

There is a loud knocking on the door.

Jeffrey gets in the closet and Dorothy closes the door.  She holds her

head collecting her fragile self.  Dorothy goes to the door and opens it.

It's the Man with the Yellow Sports Coat - tonight he's wearing a purple

sports coat and light blue double knit pants.  His eyes are glazed and his

face is broken out in a sweat.

Dorothy kicks the door after he closes it, then she chains it.  Jeffrey

comes out of the closet.

SUDDENLY, Dorothy starts to shake and cry.

Jeffrey grabs her and shakes her and holds her tight to him.  She starts

sobbing again.

Dorothy is sobbing and Jeffrey is holding her.  There is a long silence

and she calms down.

Dorothy takes Jeffrey through the kitchen and out the back.

119. INT. BACK STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

. to a back stairway leading to the roof.

120. EXT. ROOFTOP - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

The storm is closer and the dark clouds move violently in front of a full

moon.  The wind continues to moan.  They move to the roof top and Dorothy

leads Jeffrey through the chimneys to the edge of the building.  A very

sad forlorn version of "Somewhere over the Rainbow" - creeps through the

wind.

Falling.

He moves closer to her.

She makes him kiss her. he really likes it.  Once again, Jeffrey and

Dorothy get VERY HOT.  Dorothy and Jeffrey lie down on the roof.  Dorothy

cries out suddenly and bangs her head hard again and again against the

roof.

We move very close to Jeffrey's ear as Dorothy's lips come up and whisper

into it.

She reaches up and clutches Jeffrey then pulls him down with a feverish

kiss.  Lightening cracks above them and the wind howls.

FADE TO WHITE:

FADE DOWN TO:

121. EXT. LINCOLN STREET - NIGHT

Jeffrey leaves the pool of light from a street light and walks into

darkness.  He continues down the sidewalk.  He looks up at the starry sky.

The stars are so far away - the feeling is cold and lonely.

121A.

Darkness: There are bell tones sounding, and as each one sounds pin points

of light appear on Mr. Beaumonts distorted dream face.  He is trying to

speak.  He's trying to say "Jeffrey."

121B.

Another dark image appears.  A robin sits in a tree at night.  Very close.

There is a slow low reverberating chirping sound.

121C.

Now Dorothy's apartment building at night.  A very low angle looking up

to the roof.  Suddenly a pinpoint of red appears coming toward us from

the roof.  It flies toward us very fast growing larger until we see it is

a red high-heeled shoe.  As it fills the screen it becomes red lips of

Dorothy's which open into a scream.

121D.

Jeffrey wakes in his room - terrified.

122. INT. BEAUMONTS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Jeffrey is talking with Aunt Barbara in the semi-dark living room.

Jeffrey leaves and Aunt Barbara moves about tapping on the walls.  She

moves into a dark area and taps.  Something falls.  She reaches down.

In EXTREME CLOSEUP we see a termite walking by her shoe on the thick

carpet.  Then in EXTREME CLOSEUP we see Aunt Barbara's fingers pinch the

termite and bring it up in front of her thick glasses for a look.  She

looks at the termite, then looks back at the walls.

We GLIDE ALONG the dark walls of the house.

123. INT. WILLIAMS' DINING ROOM - NIGHT

They all sit around the dining room table.  They have their heads bowed

in a prayer before dinner.

They start passing food around.

Jeffrey looks around and sees Sandy looking at him.  She then gives a

stern look to Mike.  Then Mike and Sandy both look at Jeffrey.

Everyone laughs.

Sandy looks at Mike.

Everyone laughs again.

Sandy and Jeffrey share a look.

124. INT. WILLIAMS' BASEMENT - NIGHT

Mike and Sandy are sitting on a couch in the basement.  Jeffrey is sitting

on a chair nearby.  The television set is on.

Jeffrey and Sandy say "yes."

Jeffrey looks over at Sandy.  Mike sees this.  There is more tension

growing.

Mrs. Williams comes downstairs carrying a tray with dessert.

Mrs. Williams goes back upstairs.  Jeffrey and Sandy start eating their

dessert.  Sandy watches Jeffrey happily wolf down his pie.  Mike stands up.

He leaves as if he's going to go upstairs.  Once around the corner he

stops and listens to see what Jeffery and Sandy will say to one another.

Just then, Mrs. Williams starts down with the coffee for Jeffrey.

She sees Mike at the bottom of the stairs.  This seems strange to her.

Mike starts upstairs.

Downstairs, Jeffrey and Sandy hear that Mike was close by.  Mrs. Williams

and Mike pass on the stairs and Mrs. Williams enters the basement.  She

throws Sandy a concerned look.  Just then, Mike calls downstairs.

125. INT. WILLIAMS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Upstairs, Mike is by the front door.

Downstairs Mrs. Williams picks up some dishes.

Detective Williams comes to the top of the stairs and calls down.

126. INT. DETECTIVE WILLIAMS' STUDY - NIGHT

Jeffrey enters Detective Williams' study.

Jeffrey begins going through the pictures.  They are 8 X 10 black and

white prints.  Mostly they are pictures of weeds, but they look quite

beautiful in an abstract way.  As he goes through them.

Suddenly Jeffrey sees something in the black and white photos.  A piece

of cloth in the grass.  Carefully he asks.

Sandy comes into her father's study looking upset.  Detective Williams

puts the photos away.

127. INT. WILLIAMS CAR/NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - NIGHT

They pull up in front of Jeffrey's house.

130. EXT. BEAUMONTS' HOME - NIGHT

moment.

Sandy slowly drives off.  Jeffrey watches her go then turns and goes

inside his house.

131. INT. BEAUMONTS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The house is very dark and quiet.  Jeffrey finds a note by the one table

light is on.  The note is from his mother.  It reads, "Jeffrey hope you

enjoyed yourself. See you at breakfast. Love Mom."  A postscript is written

on the note by Aunt Barbara.  "Jeffrey, honey, I found these. Love, Aunt

Barbara."  Jeffrey sees that Aunt Barbara has left him two dead termites.

He picks one up and studies it.  Again we see a huge CLOSEUP of a termite

in the half-light.  Jeffrey shakes his head in amusement.

132. INT. JEFFREY'S ROOM - NIGHT

Jeffrey paces nervously.  He picks up the phone and mouthing the numbers

he dials Dorothy's number.  There is a "click" but no one speaks.

Jeffrey instinctively speaks.

Jeffrey hangs up immediately.  He's scared.

133. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/FRONT STREET - DAY

Jeffrey has a camera taped and rigged to the dashboard aimed at the front

door of Frank Booth's apartment building.  The camera is covered with a

cardboard shoe box.  Jeffrey is eating a sandwich which was

wrapped in wax paper and is waiting and watching.

A LADY steps out of the building and begins walking down the steps.

Jeffrey reaches over and removes the shoe box and quickly takes two

pictures.

We see a MAN walk down the street and turn up the steps.  Jeffrey shoots,

but really only gets the back of the man.

JEFFREY

He replaces the cardboard box and continues eating.

134. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/FRONT STREET - DAY

Later in the day.  Jeffrey sits waiting.  He looks at his watch.  It says

2:00.

As he looks up he sees Frank getting out of a car with another man. the

Yellow Man.  They head for Frank's building.  Jeffrey hurriedly removes

the shoe box and begins snapping pictures.  They mount the steps and

disappear within the old dark structure.

135. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/FRONT STREET - DAY

Jeffrey's watch - the hand - time lapses around to 3:00.

Just then, he sees movement and takes the box off the camera.  He starts

shooting as TWO MEN come out the door.  It is the Yellow Man and a man who

is very well dressed with wavy hair and a mustache.  He carries an

alligator-skin briefcase FRANK HAS DISAPPEARED.  Both are talking together

and now laughing.  Jeffrey takes five or six pictures and then tries to

cover the camera as they approach.  The box falls.  The Yellow Man looks,

but Jeffrey gets the box back in time and pretends to be looking in the

glove compartment.

The two men walk right by Jeffrey and get into the car behind his.

Jeffrey decides to follow them.  He waits a few seconds and starts off.

136. EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

They drive through town.

137. FACTORY BUILDING - DAY

. to a large factory building, park and go up a flight of metal stairs on the side of the building.  Jeffrey steps into the shadows and watches them.  At a metal landing they stop.  He sees them standing on their tip toes in order to see something in the distance.  The man with the alligator briefcase is laughing with the Yellow Man at what he sees.  He grips the Yellow Man on the shoulder.  Jeffrey cannot see what they see from his vintage point.  He looks at his watch. "3:25".

He quickly takes a picture of the two of them on the staircase.

138. EXT. ALLEY - DAY

. then he goes down an alley in the direction they were looking.  At the

end of the alley he turns left and stops short.

139. EXT. COLD STORAGE COMPANY - DAY

He sees a crowd of people, an ambulance, and two police cars.  He walks

closer.  Through the crowd he sees a broken window.  Hanging in the window

is a dead man.  Blood is dripping out of a huge wound to the head.

On the sidewalk in front of the building a woman is lying in shock.

Her legs have been brutally broken and are angled back toward her head

in horrible positions.  Jeffrey stands next to two black guys.  Suddenly

one of the police officers start pushing everyone away.  Jeffrey turns to

them.

Jeffrey takes a last look before checking his watch and hurrying off.

140. EXT. CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

Jeffrey drives up to the corner where Sandy is standing.  She is

frantically looking around.  Jeffrey stops for her.

Jeffrey looks around.  A big FOOTBALL PLAYER is running up to a chain

link fence across the street, but it's too late - Mike sees Jeffrey.

Everything stops for a moment.  Then, Mike runs off.

141. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

Sandy goes around and gets in the car.

142. INT. DINER - DAY

Jeffrey and Sandy are sitting in the diner in a different booth, but

having the same things as before.

Jeffrey stands up and moves to her side of the booth.  They stare at each

other.

Jeffrey leans over and kisses her gently.  She pulls away.

Jeffrey looks at her for a moment.

143. INT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Jeffrey winds his way up the staircase of Dorothy's apartment building.

He hesitates before crossing to Dorothy's door.  He knocks on the door and

Dorothy opens it.

144. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Dorothy closes the door.  She chains it.

They kiss.  The kiss gets hotter.  The feeling begins.

They move down the hall to the back bedroom.  They've never made love

there.  As they hurriedly undress Jeffrey sees the pointed child's hat

with the propeller.  He picks it up and spins the propeller.  It makes a

bit of music.  Dorothy shrieks as she lurches toward Jeffrey grabbing his

hand, stopping him from turning the tiny propeller.  She gains some

control of herself.  Jeffrey releases the hat into her hand.

Jeffrey moves to get out of bed.

She moves closer to him, towards his back touching it with her tongue.

She gets down in a pose and holds it.

Jeffrey's hands find her flesh and move about.

Jeffrey and Dorothy are making love in her bed in almost total darkness.

Suddenly, Dorothy gets very odd.  She turns into a little girl.  She has

a frightening little girl smile.

For just one quiet moment we see the stairway to Dorothy's apartment.

It is empty.  Then back to Jeffrey and Dorothy.

The curtains in the kitchen bellow out with an eerie gust of wind.

They kiss.

She bolts up.

She hits out at Jeffrey and strikes him in the face.  Jeffrey struggles

with her to keep her from hitting him again but she breaks loose and slams

out at his face again.  He pushes back hard and her head actually hits the

wall.  She smiles through the pain.

She falls on him and smothers him with kisses.

Jeffrey moves on top of her in the darkness.

We move very close to Jeffrey's ear as Dorothy's lips come up and whisper

into it.

But he can't stop himself or her from making love.

The movement subsides.  There is silence in the room, except for breathing.

Dorothy stops and looks at him - she holds his face.  She starts to cry.

She continues holding his face - looking in his eyes crying openly.

he pulls him down to her.

Jeffrey smiles.

146. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Later.  Jeffrey is dressed and Dorothy comes out of the bathroom in her

robe.  She is combing her hair.  One or two lights are on now.  She looks

at Jeffrey and smiles, brushes some of his hair back from his face.

Jeffrey doesn't know what to say.  He starts walking toward the door with

Dorothy beside him.

She pats her hips.

Dorothy takes the chain off the door and opens it.  The hall is empty.

There is some noise on the stairs.  Suddenly, Frank and TWO FRIENDS of

his come into view on the stairway.

Frank grabs Jeffrey and pulls him along.

147. INT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Frank takes Jeffrey on a wide-eyed terror walk down the stairway.

148. INT. FRANK'S CAR/CITY STREETS - NIGHT

Frank and Dorothy are in the front seat.  Jeffrey is sandwiched between

two very dirty strange guys in the back.  Frank is driving very fast and

very crazy.  Sitting next to him on the front seat is a police radio which

periodically blares out police reports.  At the lights, when they turn

green, Frank lays rubber.

The car roars through a seedy street lined with bars and clubs.  Liquor

and sex shop signs glow in hot neon colors.  They are blurred visions

because of the speed of Frank's car.

Driving music plays.

Frank careens dangerously down various narrow streets, just barely making

turns.  The Ford bounces off several curbs.  Dorothy occasionally steals

a glance back at Jeffrey.  She squeals out loud - sometimes with glee,

mostly in fear.

Raymond and Paul laugh with Frank, yell out or light cigarettes.

149. EXT. "BARBARY COAST" - NIGHT

Frank finally gets to where he's going - a corner bar - and skids to a

hault.  They all pile out.  Frank grabs Jeffrey.

He grabs Jeffrey and pushes him into the bar.

150. INT. "BARBARY COAST" - NIGHT

Moving fast now, they go through this dark frightening place.  Frank has

Jeffrey by the neck forcing him faster.  In the back there is a black man

fondling a white girl near a doorway.

They go through the door to a back room.  A few naked girls are there near

beds with curtains around them.  One girl lies on her bed with dried vomit

around her head and pillow.  Suddenly Frank spots his friend Willard.

He runs toward him violently and grabs him by the throat.

first landing.  Raymond joins him with a case of Pabst Blue Ribbon Beer.

A tall, slender man with a smoking jacket and a mustache opens the door.

It's BEN.  His voice is very horse from years of smoking.

155. INT. BEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The apartment is very large.  All the furniture is over-stuffed.  In

the room there is a very much over-weight WOMAN dressed in black and a

greasy-looking COUPLE.  On the couch, a YOUNG WOMAN plays with a large

doll.

Everyone kinds of mills around.  Paul sits down in a chair and starts

laughing at some private joke in his head.

The Big Lady brings the glasses in and sets them on the card table.

She looks worried.  She gives a helpless pleading look to Ben.

Frank's friends, Paul and Raymod, laugh.

Frank slaps Jeffrey in the face.

Ben goes to Jeffrey.

Jeffrey shows him.

Suddenly Ben slugs Jeffrey in the stomach.  Jeffrey doubles over.

Frank almost dies laughing.  Everyone else joins in.  Ben turns to Frank.

As Jeffrey tries to catch his breath, he sees tremendous emotion fill

Dorothy's face.  She rushes forward.  Raymond grabs her by the arm and

takes her into another room.  Jeffrey hears her crying out.  He hears a

around to Jeffrey.

Frank is doing something to Dorothy's chest but Jeffrey can't see.

Frank takes helium.

She winces and tries to pull away.

Frank pulls her over and starts to pinch her again.  It really hurts her

and she is frightened and in pain.

Frank pretends not to hear Jeffrey and pinches Dorothy's breasts real hard.

She stifles a scream.  Jeffrey gets mad.  He hits Frank hard in the face.

Everyone is deadly silent as Frank turns to Jeffrey.  Frank stares at

Jeffrey.

160. EXT. FRANK'S CAR/DIRT ROAD - NIGHT

Frank gets out and presses his face against the rear window.  His distorted

face is hideous.  He opens the back door.  Raymond and Paul grab Jeffrey

and pull him out of the car.  The Greasy Girl laughs nervously.

Dorothy doesn't move fast enough so Frank dumps her whole purse out on the

front seat and grabs the lipstick and a flashlight.  He puts lipstick

heavy onto his lips.

While Raymond and Paul hold Jeffrey.  Frank kisses Jeffrey all over the

mouth.  Jeffrey tries to hit Frank and pull away, but Raymond and Paul

have a hold of him.  Jeffrey looks very strange with these big blotches

of red lipstick on his face and mouth.

Frank slams the front door shut to muffle Dorothy.  He grabs Jeffrey and

presses his frightened face against the front window.  Then, the back

window.  Then, he flops Jeffrey up on the hood with Paul's help and presses

Jeffrey's face against the rear window.  Inside the car, this show is

crazy and scary.  Then, Frank takes Jeffrey over to the side of the car

again.

Raymond pulls Jeffrey's face back so he's looking at Frank.  Dorothy and

the Greasy Girl watch in terror.

Frank takes a small square of blue velvet out of his pocket and begins

feeling Jeffrey's face with it.

Raymond makes Jeffrey raise his arm and Jeffrey feels Frank's biceps.

Suddenly Frank starts hitting Jeffrey in the face.  Dorothy screams at the

car window.

Detective Williams' desk is the Yellow Man.  Their eyes lock.

Jeffrey freezes.

Jeffrey turns away as quickly as possible and goes over to a water cooler

and gets a drink, keeping his back to the Yellow Man.  He shakes with

fear.  He slowly turns around.  The Yellow Man is studying some papers on

his desk.

Again the Yellow Man looks up.  This time he is slightly suspicious and he

Jeffrey walks through the darkness, carrying the photos.  He stops in

troubled look.  He approaches the front door.

the door.  Sandy is in the background.  When she sees the look on Jeffrey's

Jeffrey is driving over to Sandy's.

He has to park across the street because a police car is sitting in front

of the Williams' house.  Its lights are slowly revolving on top. The engine

idles. a Man is inside. his head down, studying some papers.

Jeffrey barely notices all this, as he heads for the door.

Mrs. Williams answers the door and Sandy is behind her in the dining room.

187. INT. WILLIAMS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Jeffrey enters and crosses the room to Sandy.

Detective Williams comes in arranging some papers which he begins placing

in a briefcase on the dining room table.  Just then a man comes up to the

door which is still open.  Jeffrey turns to see.  It is Detective

T.R. Gordon, the Yellow Man.  All the color instantly drains from

Jeffrey's face.

Detective Williams turns.  He sees Detective Gordon.  He turns again.  He

sees Jeffrey's expression.  Sandy hasn't seen it yet.

Detective Williams goes to Jeffrey.  He looks him straight in the eye.  He

also positions himself between Jeffrey and T.R. Gordon.

Sandy becomes curious and moves over to Jeffrey and her father.  Jeffrey

decides to trust Detective Williams.  The Yellow Man (T.R. Gordon) yells

again.

meet once more.  The Yellow Man cocks his head. thinking.  No recognition.

with kids dancing and talking.  Jeffrey and Sandy are holding hands.

Jeffrey feels a little out of place.

A COUPLE OF GIRLS raise their eyebrows and give approving looks to Sandy.

The music is loud, fast dancing music.

Sandy leaves Jeffrey for a moment and Jeffrey watches her make her way

through the crowd to a GIRL by the record player.  Sandy confers with the

girl.  Sandy comes back to Jeffrey.

Just then, the music goes slow.

They begin to dance.  At first, further apart, then, they make the mistake

of looking in each other's eyes and they move very close together.

They move around to another look.  Then they kiss.  They kiss for the

entire rest of the song.  Between songs and during the entire next song.

They finally, as they say, come up for air.

They kiss again.  Then they dance and look at each other.  Then they hug

each other.  As they hug, Jeffrey closes his eyes.

191. INT. PARTY BASEMENT - NIGHT

193. INT./EXT. PARTY HOUSE - NIGHT

Later.  The party is breaking up.  Kids are beginning to go upstairs and go out the front doors to their cars.  Jeffrey and Sandy are coming up stairs arm in arm.  They say goodnight to the PARENTS in the living room and leave through the front door.  They can't take their eyes off one another.  They are totally oblivious to the THREE GUYS in a car across the street.

As soon as Jeffrey gets Sandy and himself in his car, he starts it and moves off.

194. INT. BEAUMONTS' CAR/NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - NIGHT

The dark car comes to life with a loud low roar and peels out with a

scream.  It follows Jeffrey and Sandy for a way, then it roars up behind

them swaying back and forth, honking its horn and trying to ram Jeffrey's

car in the rear.

Jeffrey looks frantically in the rear view mirror.  Sandy turns around in

fear.  Jeffrey guns his car and races down the street.

He swerves around the corner.  Up ahead, a car is pulling out of a

driveway.

Jeffrey swings hard around another corner and heads up a dark street,

passing "Lincoln St."

He floors the car and flies down another street very fast.

Sandy turns back to take a look.  Jeffrey swerves the car again; he bangs

it off a curb as he rounds a corner.  A hub cap goes flying off rolling

noisily down the street.

on him.  It swerves back and forth in the rear view mirror.  Now it

swerves and roars up alongside Jeffrey's car.  Sandy screams.

Jeffrey looks over.  It is Mike.  Out of enormous sense of relief he

starts laughing.  He slows instantly and so does Mike.

197. EXT. BEAUMONTS' HOME - NIGHT

He pulls slowly up in front of his house, his head back laughing.  Mike

swerves his car in front of Jeffrey's and jumps out.

Everyone turns and looks.  Slowly out of the darkness comes a nude woman.  It is Dorothy.  She is totally in shock, bloody saliva is dripping from her mouth.  She is bloody, swollen and bruised all over.  She is totally different, drained of her sexuality.  She has been ravaged.

He jumps out of the car, gets a hold of her and helps her back.  Mike

comes after him.

Mike's friends are dazed, watching Dorothy staggering beside Jeffrey.

Mike steps back as Jeffrey puts Dorothy in the car.  Jeffrey stands back

up and glances at Mike.

Jeffrey gets into the car.

Jeffrey shuts the door.  Dorothy is sandwiched between him and Sandy in

the front seat.

Mike and his friends are getting in Mike's car.  Mike is trying to start

the engine.  He does and clumsily throws the car in reverse.  He screeches

out and screeches to a stop.  Then he guns away forward and shoots crazily

down the road.

No one.

209. DETECTIVE WILLIAMS' STUDY - NIGHT

Sandy is trying to get her father on the police radio.

210. INT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Jeffrey slowly climbs the stairs.  His shoes squashing the carpet make

mall crushing sounds as he climbs higher into the building.

He arrives at the Seventh Floor and stops.  A high-pitched whine can be

heard faintly.  It gets louder as Jeffrey crosses to Dorothy's apartment

door.  He gets his key out and inserts it.  Turns it.  With a loud click

the door swings open and the high whine becomes piercing.  He sees

something and jumps back.

211. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

It is Detective Gordon, the Yellow Man, standing in the center of the room.

FLASHBACK

He plays the look into the apartment again in his mind and again.

CLOSER ON DETECTIVE GORDON

Something is wrong with him.  He is bleeding from the head.  He stands

almost motionless. in shock.

Jeffrey peers into the room again.  He enters carefully and lets the door

close behind him.  He very cautiously moves forward into the room.  Slowly

he moves closer to a hideous sight.  Standing in the middle of Dorothy's

apartment is T.R. Gordon, the Yellow Man.  He is in an extreme state of

shock.  He is bleeding badly from a huge wound at the top left of his head.  His eyes focused on something only his twisted inner mind see.  Sitting in one of Dorothy's chairs is a dead man with no ears. only half-healed bloody wounds at each side of his head.  A bullet hole in the center of his forehead.  The T.V. is crushed in but it is turned on and it is the television that produces the high electrical whine.  Jeffrey moves forward again and kicks the television cord out of the wall.  The high whine stops instantly.  Silence except for the Yellow Man's labored breathing.

Suddenly there is a loud "radio voice" coming from the Yellow Man's police

radio which is turned "on" in his jacket pocket.  Jeffrey's heart leaps

and just as suddenly the Yellow Man throws his arms out wildly knocking a

floor lamp to the ground and crushing out its light.  Jeffrey's heart goes

wild at this sight and he jumps back but the Yellow Man is silent and

motionless again.  The radio talks again.

Music. LOVE LETTERS STRAIGHT FROM MY HEART. begins to play.

Jeffrey watches the Yellow Man and listens to the radio.

Sounds of shots.

Many shots.

We see Jeffrey's face in CLOSEUP.

212. EXT. FRONT STREET - NIGHT

The real scene is before us.  Police cars line the street along with a

huge fire truck and several ambulances.  Special police marksmen are

crouched behind cars and behind a stone wall opposite Frank's building.

Screams are heard from within and police radios blare.  Shots are being

fired into a black window.  Once in a while a shot is returned.  Two

policeman are dead and one is being loaded onto an ambulance.

A policeman runs off. more shots are fired into the building but none

are returned.  The policeman comes running back.

Suddenly there is a long barrage of gunfire into Frank's apartment.

Then a loud whistle.

Police race across the street to Frank's building.

213. INT. FRANK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Police kick the door in and rush into the apartment.  It's empty excpt for

a large dog which has been shot.  The dog growls and cowers back in a

214. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jeffrey hears the radio.  He hears the policemen talking at Frank's place.  He hears that Frank is gone.  He decides to leave Dorothy's apartment.

He goes out and closes the door.

215. INT. STAIRWAY - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

The door clicks shut.  He makes his way quietly down the hall to the

stairway. thinking.  He starts down the stairs.

He rounds the corner on a landing on the stairway and goes down another

floor. and another.  At the next landing, something out the window catches

his eye.  He notices a man get out of the car.  He recognizes the man.

It is the well-dressed man he saw with the alligator briefcase.  Jeffrey

watches the man come toward Dorothy's building.  Then his eye goes back

to the man's car.  It is Frank's car.  He notices the man is carrying a

police radio.

The man enters the building at the front entrance directly below Jeffrey.

Jeffrey starts climbing back up the stairs. thinking faster.

and it drops to the floor.

Frank climbs the stairs.

Finally the key goes in and Jeffrey frantically opens the door.  He rushes

into the room.

220. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The horror and strangeness of the scene within strikes him again.  He

rushes to the Yellow Man and takes the police radio out of his pocket.

He runs into the back of the apartment - to the back bedroom where he

crouches down behind a double bed.

221. EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - NIGHT

Sandy runs frantically down a dark street.  We see a street sign which

says "Lincoln."

222. INT. DOROTHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jeffrey drops the radio under the bed and runs back to the living room.

He leaps safely into the closet just as Frank opens the apartment door and

enters.  Jeffrey freezes with fear in the darkness of the closet.  Frank

is smiling.

He starts down the hall to the back bedroom.  The police radio which

Jeffrey planted under the bed and Frank's radio both start broadcasting.

Frank turns his radio off - now only the one under the bed plays.

Jeffrey watches Frank reach inside his coat for his gun.  He watches Frank

sneak to the back bedroom area.  Jeffrey turns and looks at the Yellow

Man.  He gets an idea. He quickly rushes out of the closet - feels inside

the Yellow Man's coat for his police gun.  It's there.  He gets it but it

causes the Yellow Man to moan and leap some in another almost death-spasm.  Jeffrey takes the bloody pistol and races back inside the closet frantically catching his breath.  Just then he hears Frank in the back room.

Jeffrey then hears three or four shots - deadly sounding coming from a

pistol with a silencer attached.

Jeffrey sees a furious Frank come storming out of the back room and come

slowly up the hall - directly toward him.

Jeffrey raises his pistol - very slowly.  Frank enters the living room.

He looks around.  The Yellow Man moans.  Frank makes a face and blasts the

remainder of the Yellow Man's head away and this time the Yellow Man falls

dead to the floor.  Jeffrey tenses in the silence which hangs in the air.  Frank looks to the kitchen. all around the living room.  He looks at the closet.  He smiles - he slowly goes right toward Jeffrey - smiling.  Jeffrey points the pistol.  His finger moves to the trigger.  He squints his eyes.  He doesn't want to kill a man. any man.  Frank comes right to the closet door and throws it open, when Jeffrey hears Sandy scream.

Frank and Jeffrey lock eyes as Jeffrey pulls the trigger.  He yells Sandy's

name and Frank's head is blown off.

We see Sandy's frightened face.  We see policemen racing up the stairs in

Dorothy's apartment.

A huge low roaring sound comes in.

SLOWLY WE COME UP OUT OF A HUGE DARK HOLE. We see we are rising out of an

ear but still among the crevices.  They look enormous.  We move up and

float above the ear and traverse across a cheek to an eye.  Jeffrey's eye.

His face is bathed in light.

All sorts of springtime-in-the-garden sounds are heard.

We suddenly see that Jeffrey is sleeping in his back yard. Detective

Williams is with Mr. Beaumont working in the garden in the distance.

The sprinkler is turning.  Sandy comes out on the back porch and calls.

Jeffrey opens his eyes.  He looks around confused for a moment.  He sees

Sandy.

Sandy goes back inside.  Suddenly, a big red ROBIN chirps loudly above.

Jeffrey looks up at it sitting in the cherry tree.  The Robin and Jeffrey

seems to exchange a special look.

Jeffrey smiles up at the fat bird.

He gets off the lawn chair and walks away from us toward the back door of

the house.  As he passes his father and Detective Williams:

He and Detective Williams share a smile.

propeller comes into view.  The hat is on the head of a small child who is

dancing slowly toward Dorothy.  She is laughing.  When the boy gets within

arms reach they embrace.  We move close to Dorothy's smiling face.  Tears

of happiness come into her eyes, but there is still a distant look as we

hear Bobby Vinton sing the last lines of his song.

"and I still can see Blue Velvet through

Blue Velvet dissolves in and takes over the image.
