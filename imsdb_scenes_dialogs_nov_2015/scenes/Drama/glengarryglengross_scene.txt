John...John...John.  Okay.  John.

John.  Look:

The Glengarry Highland's leads,

you're sending Roma out.  Fine.

He's a good man.  We know what he

is.  He's fine.  All I'm saying,

you look at the board, he's

throwing...wait, wait, wait, he's

throwing them away, he's throwing

the leads away.  All that I'm

saying, that you're wasting leads.

I don't want to tell you your job.

All that I'm saying, things get

set, I know they do, you get a

certain mindset... A guy gets a

reputation.  We know how this...all

I'm saying, put a closer on the job.

There's more than one man for the...

Put a...wait a second, put a proven

man out...and you watch, now wait a

second--and you watch your dollar

volumes...You start closing them

for fifty 'stead of twenty-

five...you put a closer on the...

Shelly, you blew the last...

No.  John.  No.  Let's wait, let's

back up here, I did...will you

please?  Wait a second.  Please.  I

didn't "blow" them.  No.  I didn't

"blow" them.  No.  One kicked out,

one I closed...

...you didn't close...

...I, if you'd listen to me.

Please.  I closed the cocksucker.

His ex, John, his ex, I didn't know

he was married...he, the judge

invalidated the...

Shelly...

...and what is that, John?  What?

Bad luck.  That's all it is.  I

pray in your life you will never

find it runs in streaks.  That's

what it does, that's all it's doing.

Streaks.  I pray it misses you.

That's all I want to say.

What about the other two?

What two?

Four.  You had four leads.  One

kicked out, one the judge, you say...

...you want to see the court

records?  John?  Eh?  You want to

go down...

...no...

...do you want to go downtown...?

...no...

...then...

...I only...

...then what is this "you say"

shit, what is that?

What is that...?

All that I'm saying...

What is this "you say"?  A deal

kicks out...I got to eat.  Shit,

Williamson, shit.  You...Moss...

Roma...look at the sheets...look at

the sheets.  Nineteen eighty,

eighty-one...eighty-two...six

months of eighty-two...who's there?

Who's up there?

Roma.

Under him?

Moss.

Bullshit.  John.  Bullshit.  April,

September 1981.  It's me.  It isn't

fucking Moss.  Due respect, he's an

order taker, John.  He talks, he

talks a good game, look at the

board, and it's me, John, it's me...

Not lately it isn't.

Lately kiss my ass lately.  That

isn't how you build an org...talk,

talk to Murray.  Talk to Mitch.

When we were on Peterson, who paid

for his fucking car?  You talk to

him.  The Seville...?  He came in,

"You bought that for me Shelly."

Out of what?  Cold calling.  Nothing.

Sixty-five, when we were there,

with Glen Ross Farms?  You call 'em

downtown.  What was that?  Luck?

That was "luck"?  Bullshit, John.

You're burning my ass, I can't get

a fucking lead...you think that was

luck.  My stats for those years?

Bullshit...over that period of

time...?  Bullshit.  It wasn't luck.

It was skill.  You want to throw

that away, John...?  You want to

throw that away?

It isn't me...

...it isn't you...?  Who is it?

Who is this I'm talking to?  I need

the leads...

...after the thirtieth...

Bullshit the thirtieth, I don't get

on the board the thirtieth, they're

going to can my ass.  I need the

leads.  I need them now.  Or I'm

gone, and you're going to miss me,

John, I swear to you.

Murray...

...you talk to Murray...

I have.  And my job is to marshal

those leads...

Marshal the leads...marshal the

leads?  What the fuck, what bus did

you get off of, we're here to

fucking sell.  Fuck marshaling the

leads.  What the fuck talk is that?

What the fuck talk is that?  Where

did you learn that?  In school?

That's "talk," my friend, that's

"talk." Our job is to sell.  I'm

the man to sell.  I'm getting

garbage.

You're giving it to me, and what

I'm saying is it's fucked.

You're saying that I'm fucked.

Yes.

I am.  I'm sorry to antagonize you.

Let me...

...and I'm going to get bounced and

you're...

...let me...are you listening to

me...?

Yes.

Let me tell you something, Shelly.

I do what I'm hired to do.

I'm...wait a second.  I'm hired to

watch the leads.  I'm given...hold

on, I'm given a policy.  My job is

to do that.  What I'm told.  That's

it.  You, wait a second, anybody

falls below a certain mark I'm not

permitted to give them the premium

leads.

Then how do they come up above that

mark?  With dreck...?  That's

nonsense.  Explain this to me.

'Cause it's a waste, and it's a

stupid waste.  I want to tell you

something...

You know what those leads cost?

The premium leads.  Yes.  I know

what they cost.  John.  Because I,

I generated the dollar revenue

sufficient to buy them.  Nineteen

senny-nine, you know what I made?

Senny-nine?  Ninety-six thousand

dollars.  John?  For Murray... For

Mitch...look at the sheets...

Murray said...

Fuck him.  Fuck Murray.  John?  You

know?  You tell him I said so.

What does he fucking know?  He's

going to have a "sales"

contest...you know what our sales

contest used to be?

Money.  A fortune.  Money lying on

the ground.  Murray?  When was the

last time he went out on a sit?

Sales contest?  It's laughable.

It's cold out there now, John.

It's tight.  Money is tight.  This

ain't sixty-five.  It ain't.  It

just ain't.  See?  See?  Now, I'm a

good man--but I need a...

Murray said...

John.  John...

Will you please wait a second.

Shelly.  Please.  Murray told me:

the hot leads...

...ah, fuck this...

The...Shelly?

The hot leads are assigned according

to the board.  During the contest.

Period.  Anyone who beats fifty

per...

That's fucked.  That's fucked.  You

don't look at the fucking percentage.

You look at the gross.

Either way.  You're out.

I'm out.

Yes.

I'll tell you why I'm out.  I'm

out, you're giving me toilet paper.

John.

I've seen those leads.  I saw them

when I was at Homestead, we pitched

those cocksuckers Rio Rancho

nineteen sixty-nine they wouldn't

buy.  They couldn't buy a fucking

toaster.  They're broke, John.

They're cold.  They're deadbeats,

you can't judge on that.  Even so.

Even so.  Alright.  Fine.  Fine.

Even so.  I go in, FOUR FUCKING

LEADS they got their money in a

sock.  They're fucking Polacks,

John.  Four leads.  I close two.

Two.  Fifty per...

...they kicked out.

They all kick out.  You run in

streaks, pal.  Streaks.  I'm...

I'm...don't look at the board, look

at me.  Shelly Levene.  Anyone.

Ask them on Western.  Ask Getz at

Homestead.  Go ask Jerry Graff.

You know who I am...I NEED A SHOT.

I got to get on the fucking board.

Ask them.  Ask them.  Ask them who

ever picked up a check I was flush.

Moss, Jerry Graff, Mitch

himself...Those guys lived on the

business I brought in.  They lived

on it...and so did Murray, John.

You were here you'd of benefited

from it too.  And now I'm saying

this.  Do I want charity?  Do I

want pity?  I want sits.  I want

leads that don't come right out of

a phone book.  Give me a lead

hotter than that, I'll go in and

close it.  Give me a chance.

That's all I want.  I'm going to

get up on that fucking board and

all I want is a chance.  It's a

streak and I'm going to turn it

around.

I need your help.

I can't do it, Shelly.

Why?

The leads are assigned randomly...

Bullshit, bullshit, you assign

them... What are you telling me?

...apart from the top men on the

contest board.

Then put me on the board.

You start closing again, you'll be

on the board.

I can't close these leads, John.

No one can.  It's a joke.  John,

look, just give me a hot lead.

Just give me two of the premium

leads.  As a "test," alright?  As a

"test" and I promise you...

I can't do it, Shel.

I'll give you ten percent.

Of what?

And what if you don't close.

I will close.

What if you don't close...?

I will close.

What if you don't?  Then I'm fucked.

You see...?  Then it's my job.

That's what I'm telling you.

I will close.  John, John, ten

percent.  I can get hot.  You know

that...

Not lately you can't...

Fuck that.  That's defeatist.  Fuck

that.  Fuck it...Get on my side.

Go with me.  Let's do something.

You want to run this office, run it.

Twenty percent.

Alright.

And fifty bucks a lead.

John.

Listen.  I want to talk to you.

Permit me to do this a second.  I'm

older than you.  A man acquires a

reputation.  On the street.  What

he does when he's up, what he does

otherwise...I said "ten," you said

"no." You said "twenty." I said

"fine," I'm not going to fuck with

you, how can I beat that, you tell

me?...Okay.  Okay.  We'll...Okay.

Fine.  We'll...Alright, twenty

percent, and fifty bucks a lead.

That's fine.  For now.  That's fine.

A month or two we'll talk.  A month

from now.  Next month.  After the

thirtieth.

We'll talk.

What are we going to say?

No.  You're right.  That's for

later.  We'll talk in a month.

What have you got?  I want two sits.

Tonight.

I'm not sure I have two.

I saw the board.  You've got four...

I've got Roma.  Then I've got Moss...

Bullshit.  They ain't been in the

office yet.  Give 'em some stiff.

We have a deal or not?  Eh?  Two

sits.  The Des Plaines.  Both of

'em, six and ten, you can do

it...six and ten...eight and

eleven, I don't give a shit, you

set 'em up?  Alright?  The two sits

in Des Plaines.

Alright.

Good.  Now we're talking.

A hundred bucks.

Now?

Now?

Now.

Yes...When?

Ah, shit, John.

I wish I could.

You fucking asshole.

I haven't got it.

I haven't got it, John.

I'll pay you tomorrow.

I'm coming in here with the sales,

I'll pay you tomorrow.

I haven't got it, when I pay, the

gas...I get back the hotel, I'll

bring it in tomorrow.

Can't do it.

I'll give you thirty on them now,

I'll bring the rest tomorrow.  I've

got it at the hotel.

John?

We do that, for chrissake?

No.

I'm asking you.  As a favor to me?

John.

John: my daughter...

I can't do it, Shelly...

Well, I want to tell you something,

fella, wasn't long I could pick up

the phone, call Murray and I'd have

your job.  You know that?  Not too

long ago.  For what?  For nothing.

"Mur, this new kid burns my ass."

"Shelly, he's out." You're gone

before I'm back from lunch.  I

bought him a trip to Bermuda once...

I have to go...

Wait.  Alright.  Fine.

The one.  Give me the lead.  Give

me the one lead.  The best one you

have.

I can't split them.

Why?

Because I say so.

Is that it?  Is that it?  You want

to do business that way...?

You want to do business that way...?

Alright.  Alright.  Alright.

Alright.  What is there on the

other list...?

You want something off the B list?

Yeah.  Yeah.

Is that what you're saying?

That's what I'm saying.  Yeah.

I'd like something off the other

list.  Which, very least, that I'm

entitled to.  If I'm still working

here, which for the moment I guess

that I am.

What?  I'm sorry I spoke harshly to

you.

That's alright.

The deal still stands, our other

thing.

Good.  Mmm.  I, you know, I left my

wallet back at the hotel.

Polacks and deadbeats.

...Polacks...

Deadbeats all.

...they hold on to their money...

All of 'em.  They, hey: it happens

to us all.

Where am I going to work?

You have to cheer up, George, you

aren't out yet.

I'm not?

You missed a fucking sale.  Big

deal.  A deadbeat Polack.  Big deal.

How you going to sell 'em in the

first place...?  Your mistake, you

shoun'a took the lead.

I had to.

You had to, yeah.  Why?

To get on the...

To get on the board.  Yeah.  How

you goan'a get on the board sell'n

a Polack?  And I'll tell you, I'll

tell you what else.  You listening?

I'll tell you what else: don't ever

try to sell an Indian.

I'd never try to sell an Indian.

You get those names come up, you

ever get 'em, "Patel?"

Mmm...

You ever get 'em?

Well, I think I had one once.

You did?

I...I don't know.

You had one you'd know it.  Patel.

They keep coming up.  I don't know.

They like to talk to salesmen.

They're lonely, something.

They like to feel superior, I don't

know.  Never bought a fucking thing.

You're sitting down "The Rio Rancho

this, the blah blah blah," "The

Mountain View--" "Oh yes.  My

brother told me that..." They got a

grapevine.  Fuckin' Indians, George.

Not my cup of tea.  Speaking of

which I want to tell you something:

I never got a cup of tea with them.

You see them in the restaurants.  A

supercilious race.  What is this

look on their face all the time?  I

don't know.

I don't know.  Their broads all

look like they just got fucked with

a dead cat, I don't know.

I don't know.  I don't like it.

Christ...

What?

The whole fuckin' thing...The

pressure's just too great.  You're

ab...you're absolu...they're too

important.  All of them.  You go in

the door.  I..."I got to close this

fucker, or I don't eat lunch," "or

I don't win the Cadillac..." We

fuckin' work too hard.  You work

too hard.  We all, I remember when

we were at Platt...huh?  Glen Ross

Farms... didn't we sell a bunch of

that..."

They came in and they, you know...

Well, they fucked it up.

They did.

They killed the goose.

They did.

And now...

We're stuck with this...

We're stuck with this fucking shit...

...this shit...

It's too...

It is.

Eh?

It's too...

You get a bad month, all of a...

You're on this...

All of, they got you on this

"board..."

I, I...I...

Some contest board...

I...

It's not right.

It's not.

No.

And it's not right to the customers.

I know it's not.  I'll tell you,

you got, you know, you got...what

did I learn as a kid on Western?

Don't sell a guy one car.  Sell him

five cars over fifteen years.

That's right?

Eh...?

That's right?

Goddamn right, that's right.  Guys

come on: "Oh, the blah blah blah, I

know what I'll do: I'll go in and

rob everyone blind and go to

Argentina cause nobody ever thought

of this before."

...that's right...

Eh?

No.  That's absolutely right.

And so they kill the goose.  I, I,

I'll...and a fuckin' man, worked

all his life has got to...

...that's right...

...cower in his boots...

Shoes, boots, yes...

For some fuckin' "Sell ten thousand

and you win the steak knives..."

For some sales pro...

...sales promotion, "You lose, then

we fire your..." No.  It's

medieval... it's wrong. "Or we're

going to fire your ass." It's wrong.

Yes.

Yes, it is.  And you know who's

responsible?

Who?

You know who it is.  It's Mitch.

And Murray.  'Cause it doesn't have

to be this way.

No.

Look at Jerry Graff.  He's clean,

he's doing business for himself,

he's got his, that list of his with

the nurses...see?  You see?  That's

thinking.  Why take ten percent?  A

ten percent comm...why are we

giving the rest away?  What are we

giving ninety per...for nothing.

For some jerk sit in the office

tell you "Get out there and close."

"Go win the Cadillac." Graff.  He

goes out and buys.  He pays top

dollar for the... you see?

Yes.

That's thinking.  Now, he's got the

leads, he goes in business for

himself.  He's...that's what I...

that's thinking! "Who?  Who's got a

steady job, a couple bucks nobody's

touched, who?"

Nurses.

So Graff buys a fucking list of

nurses, one grand--if he paid two

I'll eat my hat--four, five thousand

nurses, and he's going wild...

He is?

He's doing very well.

I heard that they were running cold.

The nurses?

Yes.

You hear a lot of things...He's

doing very well.  He's doing very

well.

With River Oaks?

River Oaks, Brook Farms.  All of

that shit.  Somebody told me, you

know what he's clearing himself?

Fourteen, fifteen grand a week.

Himself?

That's what I'm saying.  Why?  The

leads.  He's got the good leads...

what are we, we're sitting in the

shit here.  Why?  We have to go to

them to get them.  Huh.  Ninety

percent our sale, we're paying to

the office for the leads.

The leads, the overhead, the

telephones, there's lots of things.

What do you need? A telephone, some

broad to say "Good morning,"

nothing...nothing...

No, it's not that simple, Dave...

Yes.  It is.  It is simple, and you

know what the hard part is?

What?

Starting up.

What hard part?

Of doing the thing.  The dif...the

difference.  Between me and Jerry

Graff.  Going to business for

yourself.  The hard part is...you

know what it is?

What?

Just the act.

What act?

To say "I'm going on my own."

'Cause what you do, George, let me

tell you what you do: you find

yourself in thrall to someone else.

And we enslave ourselves.  To

please.  To win some fucking

toaster...to...to... and the guy

who got there first made up those...

That's right...

He made up those rules, and we're

working for him.

That's the truth...

That's the God's truth.  And it

gets me depressed.  I swear that it

does.  At MY AGE.  To see a goddamn:

"Somebody wins the Cadillac this

month.  P.S. Two guys get fucked."

Huh.

You don't ax your sales force.

No.

You...

You...

You build it!

That's what I...

You fucking build it!  Men come...

Men come work for you...

...you're absolutely right.

They...

They have...

When they...

Look look look look, when they

build your business, then you can't

fucking turn around, enslave them,

treat them like children, fuck them

up the ass, leave them to fend for

themselves... no.

No.

You're absolutely right, and I want

to tell you something.

What?

I want to tell you what somebody

should do.

What?

Someone should stand up and strike

back.

What do you mean?

Somebody...

Yes...?

Should do something to them.

What?

Something.  To pay them back.

Someone, someone should hurt them.

Murray and Mitch.

Someone should hurt them.

Yes.

How?

How?  Do something to hurt them.

Where they live.

What?

Someone should rob the office.

Huh.

That's what I'm saying.  We were,

if we were that kind of guys, to

knock it off, and trash the joint,

it looks like robbery, and take the

fuckin' leads out of the files...go

to Jerry Graff.

What could somebody get for them?

What could we get for them?  I

don't know.  Buck a throw...buck-a-

half a throw...I don't know...Hey,

who knows what they're worth, what

do they pay for them?  All

told...must be, I'd... three bucks

a throw...I don't know.

How many leads have we got?

The Glengarry...the premium leads...?

I'd say we got five thousand.  Five.

Five thousand leads.

And you're saying a fella could

take and sell these leads to Jerry

Graff.

Yes.

How do you know he'd buy them?

Graff?  Because I worked for him.

You haven't talked to him.

No.  What do you mean?  Have I

talked to him about this?

Yes.  I mean are you actually

talking about this, or are we just...

No, we're just...

We're just "talking" about it.

We're just speaking about it.

As an idea.

As an idea.

Yes.

We're not actually talking about it.

No.

Talking about it as a...

No.

As a robbery.

As a "robbery"?!  No.

Well.  Well...

Hey.

So all this, um, you didn't,

actually, you didn't go talk to

Graff.

Not actually, no.

You didn't?

No.  Not actually.

Did you?

What did you say?

Yes.

I said, "Not actually." The fuck

you care, George?  We're just

talking...

We are?

Yes.

Because, because, you know, it's a

crime.

That's right.  It's a crime.  It is

a crime.  It's also very safe.

You're actually talking about this?

That's right.

You're going to steal the leads?

Have I said that?

Are you?

Did I say that?

Did you talk to Graff?

Is that what I said?

What did he say?

What did he say?  He'd buy them.

You're going to steal the leads and

sell the leads to him?

Yes.

What will he pay?

A buck a shot.

For five thousand?

However they are, that's the deal.

A buck a throw.  Five thousand

dollars.  Split it half and half.

You're saying "me."

Yes.

Twenty-five hundred apiece.  One

night's work, and the job with

Graff.  Working the premium leads.

A job with Graff.

Is that what I said?

He'd give me a job.

He would take you on.  Yes.

Is that the truth?

Yes.  It is, George.

Yes.  It's a big decision.

And it's a big reward.

It's a big reward.  For one night's

work.

But it's got to be tonight.

What?

What?  What?  The leads.

You have to steal the leads tonight?

That's right, the guys are moving

them downtown.  After the thirtieth.

Murray and Mitch.  After the contest.

You're, you're saying so you have

to go in there tonight and...

You...

I'm sorry?

You.

Me?

You have to go in.

You have to get the leads.

I do?

Yes.

I...

It's not something for nothing,

George, I took you in on this, you

have to go.  That's your thing.

I've made the deal with Graff.  I

can't go.  I can't go in, I've

spoken on this too much.  I've got

a big mouth.

"The fucking leads" et cetera, blah

blah blah "...the fucking tight ass

company..."

They'll know when you go over to

Graff...

What will they know?  That I stole

the leads?  I didn't steal the

leads, I'm going to the movies

tonight with a friend, and then I'm

going to the Como Inn.  Why did I

go to Graff?  I got a better deal.

Period.  Let 'em prove something.

They can't prove anything that's

not the case.

Dave.

Yes.

You want me to break into the

office tonight and steal the leads?

Yes.

No.

Oh, yes, George.

What does that mean?

Listen to this.  I have an alibi,

I'm going to the Como Inn, why?

Why?  The place gets robbed,

they're going to come looking for

me.  Why?  Because I probably did

it.  Are you going to turn me in?

George?  Are you going to turn me in?

What if you don't get caught?

They come to you, you going to turn

me in?

Why would they come to me?

They're going to come to everyone.

Why would I do it?

You wouldn't, George, that's why

I'm talking to you.  Answer me.

They come to you.  You going to

turn me in?

No.

Are you sure?

Yes.  I'm sure.

Then listen to this: I have to get

those leads tonight.  That's

something I have to do.  If I'm not

at the movies...if I'm not eating

over at the inn...If you don't do

this, then I have to come in here...

...you don't have to come in...

...and rob the place...

...I thought that we were only

talking...

...they take me, then.  They're

going to ask me who were my

accomplices.

Me?

Absolutely.

That's ridiculous.

Well, to the law, you're an

accessory.  Before the fact.

I didn't ask to be.

Then tough luck, George, because

you are.

Why?  Why, because you only told me

about it?

That's right.

Why are you doing this to me, Dave.

Why are you talking this way to me?

I don't understand.  Why are you

doing this at all...?

That's none of your fucking

business...

Well, well, well, talk to me, we

sat down to eat dinner, and here

I'm a criminal...

You went for it.

In the abstract...

So I'm making it concrete.

Why?

Why?  Why you going to give me five

grand?

Do you need five grand?

Is that what I just said?

You need money?  Is that the...

Hey, hey, let's just keep it

simple, what I need is not

the...what do you need...?

What is the five grand?

What is the, you said that we were

going to split five...

I lied.

Alright?  My end is my business.

Your end's twenty-five.  In or out.

You tell me, you're out you take

the consequences.

I do?

Yes.

And why is that?

Because you listened.

...all train compartments smell

vaguely of shit.  It gets so you

don't mind it.  That's the worst

thing that I can confess.  You know

how long it took me to get there?

A long time.  When you die you're

going to regret the things you

don't do.  You think you're queer...?

I'm going to tell you something:

we're all queer.  You think that

you're a thief?  So what?  You get

befuddled by a middle-class

morality...?  Get shut of it.  Shut

it out.  You cheated on your

wife...?  You did it, live with it.

You fuck little girls, so be it.

There's an absolute morality?  May

be.  And then what?  If you think

there is, then be that thing.  Bad

people go to hell?  I don't think

so.  If you think that, act that

way.  A hell exists on earth?  Yes.

I won't live in it.  That's me.

You ever take a dump made you feel

you'd just slept for twelve hours...?

Did I...?

Yes.

I don't know.

Or a piss...?  A great meal fades

in reflection.  Everything else

gains.  You know why? 'Cause it's

only food.  This shit we eat, it

keeps us going.  But it's only food.

The great fucks that you may have

had.  What do you remember about

them?

What do I...?

Yes.

Mmmm...

I don't know.  For me, I'm saying,

what is is, it's probably not the

orgasm.  Some broads, forearms on

your neck, something her eyes did.

There was a sound she made...or,

me, lying, in the, I'll tell you:

me lying in bed; the next day she

brought me cafe au lait.  She gives

me a cigarette, my balls feel like

concrete.  Eh?  What I'm saying,

what is our life?

It's looking forward or it's

looking back.  And that's our life.

That's it.  Where is the moment?

And what is it that we're afraid of?

Loss.  What else?

The bank closes.  We get sick, my

wife died on a plane, the stock

market collapsed...the house burnt

down...what of these happen...?

None on 'em.  We worry anyway.

What does this mean?  I'm not

secure.  How can I be secure?

Through amassing wealth beyond all

measure?  No.  And what's beyond

all measure?  That's a sickness.

That's a trap.  There is no measure.

Only greed.  How can we act?

The right way, we would say, to

deal with this: "There is a one-in-

a-million chance that so and so

will happen...Fuck it, it won't

happen to me..." No.  We know

that's not the right way I think.

We say the correct way to deal with

this is "There is a one-in-so-and-

so chance this will happen...God

protect me.  I am powerless, let it

not happen to me..." But no to that.

I say.  There's something else.

What is it? "If it happens, AS IT

MAY for that is not within our

powers, I will deal with it, just

as I do today with what draws my

concern today." I say this is how

we must act.  I do those things

which seem correct to me today.  I

trust myself.  And if security

concerns me, I do that which today

I think will make me secure.  And

every day I do that, when that day

arrives that I need a reserve, [a]

odds are that I have it, and [b]

the true reserve that I have is the

strength that I have of acting each

day without fear.

According to the dictates of my

mind.

Stocks, bonds, objects of art, real

estate.  Now: what are they?

An opportunity.  To what?  To make

money?  Perhaps.  To lose money?

Perhaps.  To "indulge" and to

"learn" about ourselves?  Perhaps.

So fucking what?  What isn't?

They're an opportunity.  That's all.

They're an event.  A guy comes up

to you, you make a call, you send

in a brochure, it doesn't matter,

"There're these properties I'd like

for you to see." What does it mean?

What you want it to mean.

Money?

If that's what it signifies to you.

Security?

Comfort?

All it is is THINGS THAT HAPPEN TO

YOU.

That's all it is.  How are they

different?

Some poor newly married guy gets

run down by a cab.  Some busboy

wins the lottery.

All it is, it's a carnival.  What's

special...what draws us?

We're all different.

We're not the same.

We are not the same.

Hmmm.

It's been a long day.

What are you drinking?

Gimlet.

Well, let's have a couple more.  My

name is Richard Roma, what's yours?

Lingk.  James Lingk.

James.  I'm glad to meet you.

I'm glad to meet you, James.

I want to show you something.

It might mean nothing to you...and

it might not.

I don't know.  I don't know anymore.

What is that?  Florida.  Glengarry

Highlands.  Florida. "Florida.

Bullshit." And maybe that's true;

and that's what I said: but look

here: what is this?  This is a

piece of land.  Listen to what I'm

going to tell you now:

People used to say that there are

numbers of such magnitude that

multiplying them by two made no

difference.

Who used to say that?

In school.

Alright...?

Williamson...Williamson, they stole

the contracts...?

Excuse me, sir...

Did they get my contracts?

They got...

Excuse me, fella.

...did they...

Would you excuse us, please...?

Don't fuck with me, fella.  I'm

talking about a fuckin' Cadillac

car that you owe me...

They didn't get your contract.  I

filed it before I left.

They didn't get my contracts.

They--excuse me...

Oh, fuck.  Fuck.

FUCK FUCK FUCK!  WILLIAMSON!!!

WILLIAMSON!!!

OPEN THE FUCKING...WILLIAMSON...

Who are you?

They didn't get the contracts.

Did they...

They got, listen to me...

The...

Listen to me: They got some of them.

Some of them...

Who told you...?

Who told me wh...?  You've got a

fuckin', you've...a...who is

this...?  You've got a board-up on

the window...Moss told me.

Moss...Who told him?

How the fuck do I know?

What...talk to me.

They took some of the con...

...some of the contracts...Lingk.

James Lingk.  I closed...

You closed him yesterday.

Yes.

It went down.  I filed it.

You did?

Yes.

Then I'm over the fucking top and

you owe me a Cadillac.

I...

And I don't want any fucking shit

and I don't give a shit, Lingk puts

me over the top, you filed it,

that's fine, any other shit kicks

out you go back.  You...you reclose

it, 'cause I closed it and you...you

owe me the car.

Would you excuse us, please.

I, um, and may...maybe they're in...

they're in...you should, John, if

we're ins...

I'm sure that we're insured,

George...

Fuck insured.  You owe me a car.

Please don't leave.  I'm going to

talk to you.  What's your name?

Are you talking to me?

Yes.

My name is Richard Roma.

I, you know, they should be insured.

What do you care...?

Then, you know, they wouldn't be so

ups...

Yeah.  That's swell.  Yes.  You're

right.

How are you?

I'm fine.  You mean the board?  You

mean the board...?

I don't...yes.  Okay, the board.

I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm fucked on the

board.  You.  You see how...I...

I can't...my mind must be in other

places. 'Cause I can't do any...

What?  You can't do any what?

I can't close 'em.

Well, they're old.  I saw the shit

that they were giving you.

Yes.

Huh?

Yes.  They are old.

They're ancient.

Clear...

Clear Meadows.  That shit's dead.

It is dead.

It's a waste of time.

Yes.

I'm no fucking good.

That's...

Everything I...you know...

That's not...Fuck that shit, George.

You're a, hey, you had a bad month.

You're a good man, George.

I am?

You hit a bad streak.  We've all...

look at this: fifteen units Mountain

View, the fucking things get stole.

He said he filed...

He filed half of them, he filed the

big one.  All the little ones, I

have, I have to go back and...ah,

fuck, I got to go out like a

fucking schmuck hat in my hand and

reclose the...

I mean, talk about a bad streak.

That would sap anyone's self

confi... I got to go out and

reclose all my... Where's the phones?

They stole...

They stole the...

What.  What kind of outfit are we

running where...where anyone...

They stole the phones.

Where criminals can come in here...

they take the...

They stole the phones.  They stole

the leads.  They're...Christ.

What am I going to do this month?

Oh, shit...

You think they're going to catch...

where are you going?

Down the street.

Where are you going?

To the restaura...what do you

fucking...?

Aren't you going out today?

With what?

With what, John, they took the

leads...

I have the stuff from last year's...

Oh.  Oh.  Oh, your "nostalgia"

file, they's fine.  No.  Swell.

'Cause I don't have to...

...you want to go out today...?

'Cause I don't have to eat this

month.  No.  Okay.  Give 'em to

me...

Fucking Mitch and Murray going to

shit a br...what am I going to do

all...

Were the leads...

...what am I going to do all month...

Were the leads insured?

I don't know, George, why?

'Cause, you know, 'cause they

weren't, I know that Mitch and

Murray uh...

What?

That they're going to be upset.

That's right.

You want to go out today...?

He said we're all going to have to

go talk to the guy.

What?

He said we...

To the cops?

Yeah.

Yeah.  That's swell.  Another waste

of time.

A waste of time?  Why?

Why? 'Cause they aren't going to

find the guy.

The cops?

Yes.  The cops.  No.

They aren't?

No.

Why don't you think so?

Why?  Because they're stupid.

"Where were you last night..."

Where were you?

Where was I?

Yes.

I was at home, where were you?

At home.

See...?  Were you the guy who broke

in?

Was I?

Yes.

No.

Then don't sweat it, George, you

know why?

No.

You have nothing to hide.

When I talk to the police, I get

nervous.

Yeah.  You know who doesn't?

No, who?

Thieves.

Why?

They're inured to it.

You think so?

Yes.

But what should I tell them?

The truth, George.  Always tell the

truth.  It's the easiest thing to

remember.

Patel?  Ravidam Patel?  How am I

going to make a living on thses

deadbeat wogs?  Where did you get

this, from the morgue?

If you don't want it, give it back.

I don't "want" it, if you catch my

drift.

I'm giving you three leads.  You...

What's the fucking point in any

case...?  What's the point.  I got

to argue with you, I got to knock

heads with the cops, I'm busting my

balls, sell you dirt to fucking

deadbeats money in the mattress, I

come back you can't even manage to

keep the contracts safe, I have to

go back and close them again...What

the fuck am I wasting my time, fuck

this shit.  I'm going out and

reclose last week's...

The word from Murray is: leave them

alone.  If we need a new signature

he'll go out himself, he'll be the

president, just come in, from out

of town...

Okay, okay, okay, gimme this shit.

Fine.

Now, I'm giving you three...

Three?  I count two.

Three.

Patel?  Fuck you.  Fuckin' Shiva

handed him a million dollars, told

him "sign the deal," he wouldn't

sign.  And Vishnu, too.  Into the

bargain.  Fuck that, John.  You

know your business, I know mine.

Your business is being an asshole,

and I find out whose fucking cousin

you are, I'm going to go to him and

figure out a way to have your ass...

fuck you--I'll wait for the new

leads.

Get the chalk.  Get the chalk...get

the chalk!  I closed 'em!  I closed

the cocksucker.  Get the chalk and

put me on the board.  I'm going to

Hawaii!  Put me on the Cadillac

board, Williamson!  Pick up the

fuckin' chalk.  Eight units.

Mountain View...

You sold eight Mountain View?

You bet your ass.  Who wants to go

to lunch?  Who wants to go to lunch?

I'm buying.

Eighty-two fucking grand.  And

twelve grand in commission.  John.

On fucking deadbeat magazine

subscription leads.

Who?

Read it.  Bruce and Harriett Nyborg.

What happened here?

Fuck.  I had them on River Glen.

What happened?

Somebody broke in.

Eight units?

That's right.

Shelly...!

Hey, big fucking deal.  Broke a bad

streak...

Shelly, the Machine, Levene.

You...

That's great.

Thank you, George.

Williamson, get on the phone, call

Mitch...

They took the phones...

They...

Aaronow...

They took the typewriters, they

took the leads, they took the cash,

they took the contracts...

Wh...wh...Wha...?

We had a robbery.

When?

Last night, this morning.

They took the leads?

Mmm.

Fuckin' asshole.

What, they beat you with a rubber

bat?

Cop couldn't find his dick two

hands and a map.  Anyone talks to

this guy's an asshole...

You going to turn State's?

Fuck you, Ricky.  I ain't going out

today.  I'm going home.  I'm going

home because nothing's accomplished

here...Anyone talks to this guy is...

Guess what the Machine did?

Fuck the Machine.

Mountain View.  Eight units.

Fuckin' cop's got no right talk to

me that way.  I didn't rob the

place...

You hear what I said?

Yeah.  He closed a deal.

Eight units.  Mountain View.

You did that?

Yeah.

Fuck you.

Guess who?

When...

Just now.

Guess who?

You just this morning...

Harriet and blah blah Nyborg.

You did that?

Eighty-two thousand dollars.

Those fuckin' deadbeats...

My ass.  I told 'em.

Listen to this: I said...

Hey, I don't want to hear your

fucking war stories...

Fuck you, Dave...

"You have to believe in yourself...

you"--look--"alright...?"

Give me some leads.  I'm going

out... I'm getting out of...

"...you have to believe in

yourself..."

Na, fuck the leads, I'm going home.

"Bruce, Harriet...Fuck me, believe

in yourself..."

We haven't got a lead...

Why not?

They took 'em...

Hey, they're fuckin' garbage any

case...This whole goddamn...

"...You look around, you say, 'This

one has so-and-so, and I have

nothing..."

Shit.

"'Why?  Why don't I get the

opportunities...?"

And did they steal the contracts...?

Fuck you care...?

"I want to tell you something,

Harriet..."

...the fuck is that supposed to

mean...?

Will you shut up, I'm telling you

this...

Can we get some coffee...?

How ya doing?

Fine.

Uh-huh.

If anyone's going, I could use some

coffee.

"You do get the..."

Huh?  Huh?

Fuck is that supposed to mean?

"You do get the opportunity...You

get them.  As I do, as anyone

does..."

Ricky?...That I don't care they

stole the contracts?

I got 'em in the kitchen.  I'm

eating her crumb cake.

What does that mean?

It means, Dave, you haven't closed

a good one in a month, none of my

business, you want to push me to

answer you.

And so you haven't got a contract

to get stolen or so forth.

You have a mean streak in you,

Ricky, you know that...?

Rick.  Let me tell you.  Wait,

we're in the...

Shut the fuck up.

Ricky.  You have a mean streak in

you...

And what the fuck are you babbling

about...?

Bring that shit up.  Of my volume.

You were on a bad one and I brought

it up to you you'd harbor it.

You'd harbor it a long long while.

And you'd be right.

Who said "Fuck the Machine"?

"Fuck the Machine"? "Fuck the

Machine"?  What is this.  Courtesy

class...?  You're fucked, Rick--are

you fucking nuts?  You're hot, so

you think you're the ruler of this

place...?!  You want to...

Dave...

...Shut up.  Decide who should be

dealt with how?  Is that the thing?

I come into the fuckin' office

today, I get humiliated by some

jagoff cop.  I get accused of...I

get this shit thrown in my face by

you, you geniune shit, because

you're top name on the board...

Is that what I did?  Dave?  I

humiliated you?  My God...I'm

sorry...

Sittin' on top of the world,

sittin' on top of the world,

everything's fucking peachfuzz...

Oh, and I don't get a moment to

spare for a bust-out humanitarian

down on his luck lately.  Fuck you,

Dave, you know you got a big mouth,

and you make a close the whole

place stinks with your farts for a

week. "How much you just ingested,"

what a big man you are, "Hey, let

me buy you a pack of gum.

I'll show you how to chew it." Your

pal closes, all that comes out of

your mouth is bile, how fucked up

you are...

Who's my pal...?  And what are you,

Ricky, huh, what are you, Bishop

Sheean?  Who the fuck are you, Mr.

Slick...?  What are you, friend to

the workingman?  Big deal.  Fuck

you, you got the memory a fuckin'

fly.  I never liked you.

What is this, your farewell speech?

I'm going home.

Your farewell to the troops?

I'm not going home.  I'm going to

Wisconsin.

Have a good trip.

And fuck you.  Fuck the lot of you.

Fuck you all.

You were saying?

Come on.  Come on, you got them in

the kitchen, you got the stats

spread out, you're in your shirt-

sleeves, you can smell it.  Huh?

Snap out of it, you're eating her

crumb cake.

I'm eating her crumb cake...

How was it...?

From the store.

Fuck her...

"What we have to do is admit to

ourself that we see that

opportunity...and take it.

And that's it." And we sit there.

I got the pen out...

"Always be closing..."

That's what I'm saying.  The old

ways.  The old ways...convert the

motherfucker...sell him...sell

him... make him sign the check.

The...Bruce, Harriet...the kitchen,

blah: they got their money in

government bonds...I say fuck it,

we're going to go the whole route.

I plat it out eight units.  Eighty-

two grand.  I tell them. "This is

now.  This is that thing that

you've been dreaming of, you're

going to find that suitcase on the

train, the guy comes in the door,

the bag that's full of money.  This

is it, Harriett..."

Harriett...

Bruce..."I don't want to fuck

around with you.  I don't want to

go round this, and pussyfoot around

the thing, you have to look back on

this.  I do, too.  I came here to

do good for you and me.  For both

of us.  Why take an interim position?

The only arrangement I'll accept is

full investment.  Period.  The

whole eight units.  I know that

you're saying 'be safe,' I know

what you're saying.  I know if I

left you to yourselves, you'd say

'come back tomorrow,' and when I

walked out that door, you'd make a

cup of coffee...you'd sit down...and

you'd think 'let's be safe...' and

not to disappoint me you'd go one

unit or maybe two, because you'd

become scared because you'd met

possibility.  But this won't do,

and that's not the subject..."

Listen to this, I actually said

this. "That's not the subject of

our evening together." Now I handed

them the pen.  I held it in my hand.

I turned the contract, eight units

eighty-two grand. "Now I want you

to sign."

I sat there.  Five minutes.  Then,

I sat there, Ricky, twenty-two

minutes by the kitchen clock.

Twenty-two minutes by the kitchen

clock.  Not a word, not a motion.

What am I thinking? "My arm's

getting tired?" No.  I did it.  I

did it.  Like in the old says,

Ricky.  Like I was taught... Like,

like, like I used to do...I did it.

Like you taught me...

Bullshit, you're...No.  That's

raw... well, if I did, then I'm

glad I did.  I, well.  I locked on

them.  All on them, nothing on me.

All my thoughts are on them.  I'm

holding the last thought that I

spoke: "Now is the time."

They signed, Ricky.  It was great.

It was fucking great.  It was like

they wilted all at once.  No

gesture...nothing.  Like together.

They, I swear to God, they both

kind of imperceptibly slumped.  And

he reaches and takes the pen and

signs, he passes it to her, she

signs.  It was so fucking solemn.

I just let it sit.  I nod like this.

I nod again.  I grasp his hands.  I

shake his hands.  I grasp her hands.

I nod at her like this.

"Bruce...Harriet..." I'm beaming at

them.  I'm nodding like this.  I

point back in the living room, back

to the sideboard.

I didn't fucking know there was a

sideboard there!!  He goes back, he

brings us a drink.  Little shot

glasses.  A pattern in 'em.  And we

toast.  In silence.

That was a great sale, Shelly.

Ah, fuck.  Leads!  Leads!

Williamson!

Send me out!  Send me out!

The leads are coming.

Get 'em to me!

I talked to Murray and Mitch an

hour ago.  They're coming in, you

understand they're a bit upset over

this morning's...

Did you tell 'em my sale?

How could I tell 'em your sale?  Eh?

I don't have a tel...I'll tell 'em

your sale when they bring in the

leads.  Alright?  Shelly.  Alright?

We had a little... You closed a

deal.  You made a good sale.  Fine.

It's better than a good sale.  It's

a...

Look: I have a lot of things on my

mind, they're coming in, alright,

they're very upset, I'm trying to

make some sense...

All that I'm telling you: that one

thing you can tell them it's a

remarkable sale.

The only thing remarkable is who

you made it to.

What does that fucking mean?

That if the sale sticks, it will be

a miracle.

Why should the sale not stick?

Hey, fuck you.  That's what I'm

saying.  You have no idea of your

job.  A man's his job and you're

fucked at yours.  You hear what I'm

saying to you?  Your "end of month

board..." You can't run an office.

I don't care.  You don't know what

it is, you don't have the sense,

you don't have the balls.  You ever

been on a sit?  Ever?  Has this

cocksucker ever been...you ever sit

down with a cust...

I were you, I'd calm down, Shelly.

Would you?  Would you...?  Or

you're gonna what, fire me?

It's not impossible.

On an eighty-thousand dollar day?

And it ain't even noon.

You closed 'em today?

Yes.  I did.  This morning.

What I'm saying to you: things can

change.  You see?  This is where

you fuck up, because this is

something you don't know.  You

can't look down the road.  And see

what's coming.  Might be someone

else, John.  It might be someone

new, eh?  Someone new.  And you

can't look back. 'Cause you don't

know history.  You ask them.  When

we were at Rio Rancho, who was top

man?  A month...?  Two months...?

Eight months in twelve for three

years in a row.  You know what that

means?  You know what that means?

Is that luck?  Is that some, some,

some purloined leads?  That's skill.

That's talent, that's, that's...

...yes...

...and you don't remember. 'Cause

you weren't around.  That's cold

calling.  Walk up to the door.  I

don't even know their name.  I'm

selling something they don't even

want.  You talk about soft sell...

before we had a name for it...before

we called it anything, we did it.

That's right, Shel.

And, and, and, I did it.  And I put

a kid through school.

She...and...Cold calling, fella.

Door to door.  But you don't know.

You don't know.  You never heard of

a streak.  You never heard of

"marshaling your sales force..."

What are you, you're a secretary,

John.  Fuck you.  That's my message

for you.  Fuck you and kiss my ass.

You don't like it, I'll go talk to

Jerry Graff.  Period.  Fuck you.

Put me on the board.  And I want

three worthwhile leads today and I

don't want any bullshit about them

and I want 'em close together

'cause I'm going to hit them all

today.  That's all I have to say to

you.

He's right, Williamson.

It's not right.  I'm sorry, and

I'll tell you who's to blame is

Mitch and Murray.

Oh, Christ.

The hell with him.  We'll go to

lunch, the leads won't be up for...

You're a client.  I just sold you

five waterfront Glengarry Farms.  I

rub my head, throw me the cue

"Kenilworth."

What is it?

Kenilw...

I own the property, my mother owns

the property, I put her into it.

I'm going to show you on the plats.

You look when you get home A-3

through A-14 and 26 through 30.

You take your time and if you still

feel.

No, Mr. Roma.  I don't need the

time, I've made a lot of investments

in the last...

I've got to talk to you.

Jim!  What are you doing here?  Jim

Lingk, D. Ray Morton...

Glad to meet you.

I just put Jim into Black

Creek...are you acquainted with...

No...Black Creek.  Yes.  In Florida?

Yes.

I wanted to speak with you about...

Well, we'll do that this weekend.

My wife told me to look into...

Beautiful.  Beautiful rolling land.

I was telling Jim and Jinny, Ray, I

want to tell you something.

You, Ray, you eat in a lot of

restaurants.  I know you do...

Mr. Morton's with American Express...

he's...

I can tell Jim what you do...?

Sure.

Ray is director of all European

sales and services for American

Ex...

But I'm saying you haven't had a

meal until you've tasted...I was at

the Lingks' last...as a matter of

fact, what was that service feature

you were talking about...?

Which...

"Home Cooking"...what did you call

it, you said it...it was a tag

phrase that you had,,,

Uh...

Home...

Home cooking...

The monthly interview...?

Oh!  For the magazine...

Yes.  Is this something that I can

talk ab...

Well, it isn't coming out until the

February iss...sure.  Sure, go

ahead, Ricky.

You're sure?

Go ahead.

Well, Ray was eating at one of his

company's men's home in France...the

man's French, isn't he?

No, his wife is.

Ah.  Ah, his wife is.  Ray: what

time do you have...?

Twelve-fifteen.

Oh!  My God...I've got to get you

on the plane!

Didn't I say I was taking the two

o'...

No.  You said the one.  That's why

you said we couldn't talk till

Kenilworth.

Oh, my God, you're right!  I'm on

the one...

Well, let's scoot...

I've got to talk to you...

I've got to get Ray to O'Hare...

Come on, let's hustle...

John!  Call American Express in

Pittsburgh for Mr. Morton, will

you, tell them he's on the one

o'clock.

I'll see you...Christ, I'm sorry

you came all the way in...I'm

running Ray over to O'Hare...You

wait here, I'll...no.

I'm meeting your man at the bank...

I wish you'd phoned...I'll tell

you, wait: are you and Jinny going

to be home tonight?

I...

Rick.

What?

Kenilworth...?

I'm sorry...?

Kenilworth.

Oh, God...Oh, God...

Jim, excuse me...Ray, I told you,

who he is is the senior vice-

president American Express.  His

family owns 32 per...Over the past

years I've sold him...I can't tell

you the dollar amount, but quite a

lot of land.  I promised five weeks

ago that I'd go to the wife's

birthday party in Kenilworth

tonight.

I have to go.  You understand.

They treat me like a member of the

family, so I have to go.

It's funny, you know, you get a

picture of the Corporation-Type

Company Man, all business...this

man, no.  We'll go out to his home

sometime.  Let's see.

Tomorrow.  No.  Tomorrow, I'm in

L.A....Monday...I'll take you to

lunch, where would you like to go?

My wife...

Rick...?

I'm sorry, Jim.  I can't talk now.

I'll call you tonight...I'm sorry.

I'm coming, Ray.

My wife said I have to cancel the

deal.

It's a common reaction, Jim.  I'll

tell you what it is, and I know

that that's why you married her.

One of the reasons is prudence.

It's a sizable investment.  One

thinks twice...it's also something

women have.  It's just a reaction

to the size of the investment.

Monday, if you'd invite me for

dinner again...

This woman can cook...

I'm sure she can...

We're going to talk.  I'm going to

tell you something.  Because

there's something about your

acreage I want you to know.  I

can't talk about it now.  I really

shouldn't.  And, in fact, by law,

I...

The man next to you, he bought his

lot at forty-two, he phoned to say

that he'd already had an offer...

Rick...?

I'm coming, Ray...what a day!  I'll

call you this evening, Jim.  I'm

sorry you had to come in...Monday,

lunch.

My wife...

Rick, we really have to go.

My wife...

Monday.

She called the consumer...the

attorney, I don't know.  The

attorney gen...they said we have

three days...

Who did she call?

I don't know, the attorney gen...

the...some consumer office, um...

Why did she do that, Jim?

I don't know.

They said we have three days.

They said we have three days.

Three days.

To...you know.

No, I don't know.  Tell me.

To change our minds.

Of course you have three days.

So we can't talk Monday.

Jim, Jim, you saw my book...I

can't, you saw my book...

But we have to before Monday.  To

get our money ba...

Three business days.  They mean

three business days.

Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.

I don't understand.

That's what they are.  Three

business...I wait till Monday, my

time limit runs out.

You don't count Saturday.

I'm not.

No, I'm saying you don't include

Saturday...in your three days.

It's not a business day.

But I'm not counting it.

Wednesday.  Thursday.  Friday.  So

it would have elapsed.

What would have elapsed?

If we wait till Mon...

When did you write the check?

Yest...

What was yesterday?

Tuesday.

And when was that check cashed?

I don't know.

What was the earliest it could have

been cashed?

I don't know.

Today.

Today.  Which, in any case, it was

not, as there were a couple of

points on the agreement I wanted to

go over with you in any case.

The check wasn't cashed?

I just called downtown, and it's on

their desk.

Rick...

One moment, I'll be right with you.

In fact, a...one point, which I

spoke to you of which

I can't talk to you about here.

Levene!!!

I, I...

Listen to me, the statute, it's for

your protection.  I have no

complaints with that, in fact, I

was a member of the board when we

drafted it, so quite the opposite.

It says that you can change your

mind three working days from the

time the deal is closed.

Levene!

Which, wait a second, which is not

until the check is cashed.

Levene!!

I'm through, with this fucking

meshugaas.  No one should talk to a

man that way.  How are you talking

to me that...?

Levene!

...how can you talk to me that...

that...

Rick, I'm going to flag a cab.

I didn't rob...

Shelly: get in the office.

I didn't...why should I..."Where

were you last..." Is anybody

listening to me...?  Where's

Moss...?  Where...?

Levene?

Is this Lev...

Ah.  Ah.  Perhaps I can advise you

on that...

Excuse us, will you...?

...Come in here...I work here, I

don't come in here to be

mistreated...

Go to lunch, will you...

I want to work today, that's why I

came...

The leads come in, I'll let...

...that's why I came in.  I thought

I...

Just go to lunch.

I don't want to go to lunch.

Go to lunch, George.

Where does he get off to talk that

way to a working man?  It's not...

Will you take it outside, we have

people trying to do business here...

That's what, that's what, that's

what I was trying to do.

That's why I came in...I meet

gestapo tac...

Excuse me...

I meet gestapo tactics...I meet

gestapo tactics...That's not

right... No man has the right

to..."Call an attorney," that means

you're guilt... you're under

sus..."Co...," he says, "cooperate"

or we'll go downtown.  That's

not...as long as I've...

Will you get out of here.  Will you

get out of here.  Will you.  I'm

trying to run an office here.  Will

you go to lunch?  Go to lunch.

Will you go to lunch?

Will you excuse...

Where did Moss...?  I...

Will you excuse us please?

Uh, uh, did he go to the restaurant?

I...I...

I'm very sorry, Jimmy.  I apologize

to you.

It's not me, it's my wife.

What is?

I told you.

Tell me again.

What's going on here?

Tell me again.  Your wife.

I told you.

You tell me again.

She wants her money back.

We're going to speak to her.

No.  She told me "right now."

We'll speak to her, Jim...

She won't listen.

Roma.

She told me if not, I have to call

the State's attorney.

No, no.  That's just something she

"said." We don't have to do that.

She told me I have to.

No, Jim.

I do.  If I don't get my money

back...

Roma!

I'm talking to you...

I've...look.

Will someone get this guy off my

back.

You have a problem?

Yes, I have a problem.  Yes, I do,

my fr...It's not me that ripped the

joint off, I'm doing business.

I'll be with you in a while.  You

got it...?

Where are you going?

I'm...

Where are you going...?  This is

me...This is Ricky, Jim.  Jim,

anything you want, you want it, you

have it.  You understand?  This is

me.  Something upset you.  Sit

down, now sit down.  You tell me

what it is.

Am I going to help you fix it?

You're goddamned right I am.  Sit

down.  Tell you something...?

Sometimes we need someone from

outside.  It's...no, sit down...Now

talk to me.

I can't regotiate.

What does that mean?

That...

...what, what, say it.  Say it to

me...

I...

What...?

I...

What...?  Say the words.

I don't have the power.

I said it.

What power?

The power to negotiate.

To negotiate what?

To negotiate what?

This.

What, "this"?

The deal.

The "deal," forget the deal.

Forget the deal, you've got

something on your mind, Jim, what

is it?

I can't talk to you, you met my

wife, I...

What?

What?

What, Jim: I tell you what, let's

get out of here...let's go get a

drink.

She told me not to talk to you.

Let's...no one's going to know,

let's go around the corner and

we'll get a drink.

She told me I had to get back the

check or call the State's att...

Forget the deal, Jimmy.

Forget the deal...you know me.  The

deal's dead.  Am I talking about

the deal?  That's over.  Please.

Let's talk about you.  Come on.

Come on.

Come on, Jim.

I want to tell you something.  Your

life is your own.  You have a

contract with your wife.  You have

certain things you do jointly, you

have a bond there...and there are

other things.  Those things are

yours.  You needn't feel ashamed,

you needn't feel that you're being

untrue...or that she would abandon

you if she knew.  This is your life.

Yes.  Now I want to talk to you

because you're obviously upset and

that concerns me.  Now let's go.

Right now.

Roma...

...and...and...

What?

And the check is...

What did I tell you?

What did I say about the three

days...?

Roma, would you, I'd like to get

some lunch...

I'm talking with Mr. Lingk.  If you

please, I'll be back in.

I'll be back in a while...I told

you, check with Mr. Williamson.

The people downtown said...

You call them again.  Mr.

Williamson...!

Yes.

Mr. Lingk and I are going to...

Yes.  Please.  Please.

The police

can be...

What are the police doing?

It's nothing.

What are the police doing here...?

We had a slight burglary last night.

It was nothing...I was assuring Mr.

Lingk...

Mr. Lingk.  James Lingk.  Your

contract went out.  Nothing to...

John...

Your contract went out to the bank.

You cashed the check?

We...

...Mr. Williamson...

Your check as cashed yesterday

afternoon.  And we're completely

insured, as you know, in any case.

You cashed the check?

Not to my knowledge, no...

I'm sure we can...

Oh, Christ...

Don't follow me...Oh, Christ.

I know I've let you down.  I'm

sorry.  For...Forgive...for...I

don't know anymore.

Forgive me.

You stupid fucking cunt.  You,

Williamson...I'm talking to you,

shithead...You just cost me six

thousand dollars.

Six thousand dollars.  And one

Cadillac.  That's right.  What are

you going to do about it?  What are

you goin to do about it, asshole.

You fucking shit.  Where did you

learn your trade.  You stupid

fucking cunt.  You idiot.  Whoever

told you you could work with men?

Could I...

I'm going to have your job, shithead.

I'm going downtown and talk to

Mitch and Murrray, and I'm going to

Lemkin.  I don't care whose nephew

you are, who you know, whose dick

you're sucking on.  You're going

out, I swear to you, you're going...

Hey, fella, let's get this done...

Anyone in this office lives on

their wits...

I'm going to be with you in a

second.

What you're hired for is to help

us--does that seem clear to you?

To help us.  Not to fuck us up...to

help men who are going out there to

try to earn a living.  You fairy.

You company man...I'll tell you

something else.  I hope you knocked

the joint off, I can tell our

friend here something might help

him catch you.

You want to learn the first rule

you'd know if you ever spent a day

in your life...you never open your

mouth till you know what the shot

is.

You fucking child...

You are a shithead, Williamson...

Mmm.

You can't think on your feet you

should keep your mouth closed.

You hear me?  I'm talking to you.

Do you hear me...?

Yes.

I hear you.

You can't learn that in an office.

Eh?  He's right.  You have to learn

it on the streets.  You can't buy

that.  You have to live it.

Mmm.

Yes.  Mmm.  Yes.  Precisely.

Precisely. 'Cause your partner

depends on it.

I'm talking to you, I'm trying to

tell you something.

You are?

Yes, I am.

What are you trying to tell me?

What Roma's trying to tell you.

What I told you yesterday.  Why you

don't belong in this business.

Why I don't...

You listen to me, someday you might

say, "Hey..." No, fuck that, you

just listen what I'm going to say:

your partner depends on you.  Your

partner...a man who's your "partner"

depends on you...you have to go

with him and for him...or you're

shit, you're shit, you can't exist

alone...

Excuse me...

...excuse me, nothing, you be as

cold as you want, but you just

fucked a good man out of six

thousand dollars and his goddamn

bonus 'cause you didn't know the

shot, if you can do that and you

aren't man enough that it gets you,

then I don't know what, if you

can't take some thing from that...

you're scum, you're fucking white-

bread.  You be as cold as you want.

A child would know it, he's right.

You're going to make something up,

be sure it will help or keep your

mouth closed.

Mmm.

Now I'm done with you.

How do you know I made it up?

What?

How do you know I made it up?

What are you talking about?

You said, "You don't make something

up unless it's sure to help."

How did you know that I made it up?

What are you talking about?

I told the customer that his

contracts had gone to the bank.

Well, hadn't it?

No.

It hadn't.

Don't fuck with me, John, don't

fuck with me...what are you saying?

Well, I'm saying this, Shel:

usually I take the contracts to the

bank.  Last night I didn't.  How

did you know that?  One night in a

year I left a contract on my desk.

Nobody knew that but you.  Now how

did you know that?

You want to talk to me, you want to

talk to someone else...because this

is my job.  This is my job on the

line, and you are going to talk to

me.  Now how did you know that

contract was on my desk?

You're so full of shit.

You robbed the office.

Sure!  I robbed the office.  Sure.

What'd you do with the leads?

You want to go in there?  I tell

him what I know, he's going to dig

up something...You got an alibi

last night?  You better have one.

What did you do with the leads?  If

you tell me what you did with the

leads, we can talk.

I don't know what you are saying.

If you tell me where the leads are,

I won't turn you in.  If you don't,

I am going to tell the cop you

stole them, Mitch and Murray will

see that you go to jail.  Believe

me they will.  Now, what did you do

with the leads?  I'm walking in

that door--you have five seconds to

tell me: or you are going to jail.

I...

I don't care.  You understand?

Where are the leads?

Alright.

I sold them to Jerry Graff.

How much did you get for them?

How much did you get for them?

Five thousand.  I kept half.

Who kept the other half?

Do I have to tell you?

Moss.

That was easy, wasn't it?

It was his idea.

Was it?

I...I'm sure he got more than the

five, actually.

Uh-huh?

He told me my share was twenty-five.

Mmm.

Okay: I...look: I'm going to make

it worth your while.  I am.  I

turned this thing around.  I closed

the old stuff, I can do it again.

I'm the one's going to close 'em.

I am!  I am! 'Cause I turned this

thing a...I can do that, I can do

anyth...last night.  I'm going to

tell you, I was ready to Do the

Dutch.  Moss gets me, "Do this,

we'll get well..." Why not.  Big

fuckin' deal.  I'm halfway hoping

to get caught.  To put me out of

my...

But it taught me something.  What

it taught me, that you've got to

get out there.  Big deal.  So I

wasn't cut out to be a thief.  I

was cut out to be a salesman.  And

now I'm back, and I got my balls

back...and, you know, John, you

have the advantage on me now:

Whatever it takes to make it right,

we'll make it right.  We're going

to make it right.

I want to tell you something,

Shelly.  You have a big mouth.

What?

You've got a big mouth, and now I'm

going to show you an even bigger

one.

Where are you going, John?...you

can't do that, you don't want to do

that...hold, hold on...hold on...

wait...wait...wait...

Wait...uh, look...

Look, twelve, twenty, two, twen...

twenty-five hundred, it's...take it.

Take it all...

Take it!

No, I don't think so, Shel.

I...

No, I think I don't want your money.

I think you fucked up my office.

And I think you're going away.

I...what?  Are you, are you, that's

why...?  Are you nuts?  I'm...I'm

going to close for you, I'm going

to...

Here, here, I'm going to make this

office...I'm going to be back there

Number One...Hey, hey, hey!  This

is only the

beginning...List...list... listen.

Listen.  Just one moment.

List...here's what...here's what

we're going to do.  Twenty percent.

I'm going to give you twenty

percent of my sales...

Twenty percent.

For as long as I am with the firm.

Fifty percent.

You're going to be my partner.

Fifty percent.  Of all my sales.

What sales?

What sales...?  I just closed

eighty-two grand...Are you

fuckin'...I'm back...I'm back, this

is only the beginning.

Only the beginning...

Abso...

Where have you been, Shelly?  Bruce

and Harriet Nyborg.  Do you want to

see the memos...?  They're nuts...

they used to call in every week.

When I was with Webb.  And we were

selling Arizona...they're nuts...did

you see how they were living?  How

can you delude yours...

I've got the check...

Forget it.  Frame it.  It's

worthless.

The check's no good?

You stick around I'll pull the memo

for you.

I'm busy now...

Their check's no good?  They're

nuts...?

Call up the bank.  I called them.

You did?

I called them when we had the

lead... four months ago.

The people are insane.  They just

like talking to salesmen.

Don't.

I'm sorry.

Why?

Because I don't like you.

John: John:...my daughter...

Fuck you.

Asshole...

Guy couldn't find his fuckin' couch

in the living room...Ah, Christ...

what a day, what a day...I haven't

even had a cup of coffee...Jagoff

John opens his mouth he blows my

Cadillac...

I swear...it's not a world of men...

it's not a world of men, Machine...

it's a world of clock watchers,

bureaucrats, officeholders...what

it is, it's a fucked-up

world...there's no adventure to it.

Dying breed.  Yes it is.

We are the members of a dying breed.

That's...that's...that's why we

have to stick together.  Shel: I

want to talk to you.

I've wanted to talk to you for some

time.  For a long time, actually.

I said, "The Machine, there's a man

I would work with.  There's a

man..." You know?  I never said a

thing.  I should have, don't know

why I didn't.  And that shit you

were slinging on my guy today was

so good...it...it was, and, excuse

me, 'cause it isn't even my place

to say it.  It was admirable...it

was the old stuff.  Hey, I've been

on a hot streak, so what?  There's

things that I could learn from you.

You eat today?

Me.

Yeah.

Mm.

Well, you want to swing by the

Chinks, watch me eat, we'll talk?

I think I'd better stay here for a

while.

Mr. Levene...?

You're done, come down, and let's...

Would you come in here, please?

And let's put this together.  Okay?

Shel?  Say okay.

Huh.

Mr. Levene, I think we have to talk.

I'm going to the Chinks.  You're

done, come down, we're going to

smoke a cigarette.

I...

...Get in the room.

Hey, hey, hey, easy friend.  That's

the "Machine." That is Shelly "The

Machine" Lev...

Get in the goddamn room.

Ricky, I...

Okay, okay, I'll be at the resta...

Ricky...

"Ricky" can't help you, pal.

...I only want to...

Yeah.  What do you want?  You want

to what?

Williamson: listen to me: when the

leads come in...listen to me: when

the leads come in I want my top two

off the list.  For me.  My usual

two.  Anything you give Levene...

...I wouldn't worry about it.

Well I'm going to worry about it,

and so are you, so shut up and

listen.

I GET HIS ACTION.  My stuff is

mine, whatever he gets for himself,

I'm talking half.  You put me in

with him.

Did they...?

You understand?

Did they catch...?

Do you understand?  My stuff is

mine, his stuff is ours.  I'm

taking half of his commissions--

now, you work it out.

Mmm.

Did they find the guy who broke

into the office yet?

No.  I don't know.

Did the leads come in yet?

No.

Oh, God, I hate this job.

I'll be at the restaurant.
