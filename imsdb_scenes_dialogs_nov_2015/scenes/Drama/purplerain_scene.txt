SOUND under: MUSIC building in INTENSITY

as--

Then huge CU of EYES opening, gazing

into mirror, HAND applying makeup,

sudden BLACKNESS, then--

BURN IN MAIN TITLE:    PURPLE RAIN

Now,  pulsating COLOR -- FLASHES of hot,

white LIGHT...

and the BEAT provocative now,

relentless, BUILDING with fierce intent

to--

The MECCA!  The last stop for a band

before national fame.

The HUGE cavernous HALL is PACKED!

PEOPLE are DANCING like MAD! VIDEO

SCREENS with WILD GRAPHICS hang

suspended from the ceilings. Beautiful

WAITRESSES criss-cross the floor in a

frenzy.

PRINCE is CENTER-STAGE -- LIPS caressing

the mike, black, lustrous hair shining,

eyes dancing -- SINGING "Let's Get

Crazy" as the CROWD pulsates beneath the

LASER  LIGHTS.

The MUSIC  continues as we ...

CUT TO:

A TAXI pulls UP with a SCREECH.  VANITY

slouches in the backseat.  Black  boots,

black skin-tight pants, and a mane of

thick, black hair presents a beautiful

and imposing  figure. Her eyes are

large and dark -- her look open and

ripe.  She knows what she's got, and

doesn't make any excuses for it -- but

the fact is she's scared as hell,

possessing a  vulnerability that

surprises her by its suddenness.  An

expensive gold chain is fastened on one

boot.

She scrounges through her bag -- pulls

out her remaining cash. It's drastically

short of what she owes and she knows it.

She tosses it onto the front seat,

JUMPS from the cab, streaks across the

street.  The CABBIE lets out a YELL and

JUMPS out after her.

"Let's Get  Crazy" continues as we ...

CUT TO:

MORRIS DAY stands in the shower, steam

whirling about his face.  He's 22 years

old, matinee-idol sexy with large, dark,

bedroom eyes.  He headlines a slick

techno-funk group called THE TIME which

sports gangster suits and wide-brimmed

hats. He's gifted with a wealth of self-

laudatory humor which he uses like a

knife, moving through life with a calm,

but ruthless grace.

Make no mistake, Morris is nobody's

fool.   His seeming out-raceousness, his

charm -- every move he makes is for a

calculated effect.  He knows exactly

what the ladies need, and doesn't mind

reminding them should they forget ...

He breaks into a wide grin.  Hair

standing up like Don King, he wipes off

a hand mirror, regards himself

unabashedly as he brushes his teeth.

"Let's Get Crazy" continues as we...

CUT TO:

Prince sits in front of the mirror,

finishes applying his makeup.  Black

hair flowing, eyes wide and fantastic,

he regards himself a moment before

jumging up.  He puts on a high-collared

overcoat, grabs his guitar  moves

quickly to the basement window.  He

hoists himself through it, disappears

into the night.

"Let's Get Crazy" continues as we ...

CUT TO:

A POLICE CAR, lights FLASHING, sits at

the curb.  A small CROWD has rathered

about.  The Cabbie stands on the

sidewalk gesticulating angrily to a COP.

Vanity stands by the police car,

obviously board, another COP by her

side.  Her eyes are fastened on a good-

looking BUSINESSMAN standing nearby...

A silent negotiation seems to be going

on.  Understanding wafts between them

like a passing breeze.

Without taking his eyes off her, the

Businessman approaches the Cabbie,

starts talking ...

"Let's Get Crazy" continues as we...

CUT TO:

Morris moves lasciviously into the

BEDROOM wearing a red muscle T-shirt,

orange baggy shorts, and green knee-hi

socks fastened to garters.  A yellow

bandanna holds up his hair.

The bedroom is a MESS.  A VACUUM CLEANER

stands like a sentry in the middle of

the floor.  He turns it on, blazes a

path to his closet.  He yanks out a well-

pressed suit, holds it against him,

strikes a sexy, half-lidded pose only a

mother could love--

"Let's Get Crazy" continues as we ...

CUT TO:

The STREETS are swollen with TRAFFIC.

KIDS are packed onto the sidewalk,

waiting to get into the club. Prince,

riding his MOTORCYCLE, weaves between

jammed cars, then blasts down a narrow

alley leading to the rear entrance.  His

guitar is slung across his back.  He

chains up his bike, moves past a CROWD

of KIDS, cuts inside.

'Let's Get Crazy" continues as we ...

CUT TO:

A SEVILLE sweeps to a stop.  The

Businessman is at the wheel. Vanity

steps from the car languidly and offers

a curt wave goodbye.  The car pulls

away.

She stands serenely a moment as the CAR

twists around the corner.   She grabs

her bag, rushes into a dark alley.  She

pulls a handful of CASH from her pocket,

counts through it quickly.

'Let's Get Crazy" -continues as we ...

CUT TO:

The DOOR opens -- Morris steps

confidently into the night. The change

in his appearance is breathtaking. A

cashmere coat is draped over his

shoulders, a white scarf hangs loosely

about his neck.  Wearing a sharp,

gangster-style suit, his hair is a

pompadour, and Stacy Adams on his feet -

- Morris is the very picture of

elegance.   He doesn't just walk to the

curb, he slides -- his promenade

punctuated with a dip at the knees you

could snap your fingers to.

JEROME is at the curb, buffing down the

bumper of a yellow, 1970 Fleetwood

Cadillac.  Jerome is solidly built,

smooth-faced handsome with a boyish

charm all his own.  He's a member of The

Time, and acts as Morris' chauffeur,

valet, and all-purpose shadow.

He moves quickly to the door, holds it

open as Morris settles himself into the

backseat. He closes it with a flair,

hops behind the wheel, pulls out.

'Let's Get Crazy" continues as we...

CUT TO:

Prince is BACKSTAGE, practicing spins in

front of the mirror. The other MEMBERS

of his CROUP are scattered throughout

the room.  BOBBY sits off to the side,

his drumsticks tapping against his knee.

MATT puts on his doctor's smock.  LISA

and WENDY finish applying their makeup.

MARK runs his fingers up and down the

neck of his bass guitar.

Suddenly a STAGEHAND pokes his head into

the room, holds the door open as Prince

and his band cut quickly to the stage.

'Let's Get Crazy' continues as we...

CUT TO:

The DOOR opens -- A LIGHT goes on.

Vanity stands in the hallway,  peers

cautiously into a squalid, rundown room.

She hesitates briefly, seems to sigh,

then indicates she will take it.  The

MANAGER closes the door as he leaves.

She stands a moment, surveys the room.

A bed and bureau, sink, a chair,

hotplate -- simply the essentials. She

pulls a dress from her bag, a pair of hi-

heels, some gloves, underwear.  She

hangs the dress on a rod, places the

shoes beneath it, arranges the rest in a

bureau drawer.  She looks around once

more -- flowered wallpaper peels from

the walls.

She rushes to the window, tears open the

shutters -- iron bars obstruct her

view...

... KIDS are crowded in front of the

CLUB.  A YELLOW CADDY SCREECHES up in

front.   TRAFFIC is jammed all around.

The night is electric -- the scene

beckons ...

She runs from the room, cuts down the

hallway, slanming the door behind her

...

"Let's Get Crazy" continues as we...

CUT TO:

Jerome opens the door of the CADDY,

helps Morris out.  The CROWD recognizes

them immediately, rushes in for a closer

look.   Morris loves the attention,

plays to their enthusiasm with a relish.

Jerome snaps a comb into his hand, holds

up a pocket mirror ...

Morris combs his hair dramatically, the

Crowd encouraging him on.  Jerome gives

him the OK sign, ushers him into the

club.

"Let's Get Crazy" continues as we...

CUT TO:

Prince onstage performing "Let's Get

Crazy."   He's locked into a guitar

solo, moving provocatively with Wendy.

The CROWD is packed onto the DANCE

FLOOR, thick against the stage.

Jerome makes his way through the crowd,

blazing a path for Morris who is

surrounded by a dozen BABES.

Occasionally Morris glances at Prince --

discloses by his look that he doesn't

care much for his act -- or his music...

He breaks off from the Girls, follows

Jerome to the backstage entrance where

they're joined by other MEMBERS of The

Time -- JESSE and JELLYBEAN among them.

Morris casts another glance toward

Prince, breaks into a self-satisfied

grin--

"Let's Get Crazy" continues as we...

CUT TO:

COMMOTION! The CROWD has become

unwieldly -- TRAFFIC is snarled all

around.  HORNS are BLARING.   COPS try

desperately to ward off the inevitable

grid lock.

Vanity runs against the light, moves to

the head of the queue to the

accompaniment of JEERS and CATCALLS.

She doesn't budge an inch, KNOCKS

rapidly on the glass door, catching the

attention of CHICK, a burly, 6'5", 285

pound bouncer with a white beard and

long flowing hair.  An ex-Marine,

Chick's function is obvious.  He cracks

the door--

Suddenly a FIGHT breaks out at the

INSIDE MONEY WINDOW.  Chick spins

instantly, SLAMS the door -- but Vanity

jams her boot into the narrow space.

The door crashes against her instep, she

winces in pain --but Chick doesn't

notice.  He's already upon the

OFFENDERS,  heaving them against the

wall.

Vanity streaks inside, blazes up the

stairway, ducks behind a GROUP of

GIRLS...

CHICK turns instantly -- the door is

closed -- VANITY, gone.  His eyes dart

up the stairway -- nothing.  He shrugs,

drags the Two Guys off.

VANITY watches as he moves away.   She

jumps up, lunges onto the dance floor,

CRASHES into a waitress, JILL, whose

tray SMASHES to the floor--

She's 18 years old, blonde and pretty in

a cute, innocent way.   A Daisy Mae-type

whose emotions form so quickly, she has

trouble sorting them out.  Right now

she's mad as hell -- she thinks--

Jill squats, picks up the broken glasses-

-

Jill points -- Vanity hurries away  --

Vanity stops dead in her tracks, does a

slow burn.  She walks back to Jill--

Vanity simmers, enunciates every word--

And she turns on her heels, makes her

way through the club, moving into the

vicinity of the stage.  Vanity follows

her reluctantly, casts a look to the

band.   She spots Prince for the first

time -- stops instantly...

His effect on her is instantaneous.

Passion surges through her like a tidal

wave.  His hair, face, eyes -- it all

conspires to make her weak.  It's like

meeting someone for the first time, but

seeing so much of yourself in them, that

their lips, eyes, mouth -- you're

certain you have touched, and the desire

to be with them becomes so strong that

the very act of touching will release

you in a way you never thought

possible...

Prince brines "Let's Get Crazy" to a

rousing, blistering end.  Suddenly the

stage is plunged into darkness. The

CROWD goes WILD!

...Vanity snaps out of it.  Jill is

tugging at her arm, a puzzled look on

her face--

Vanity hands the card back  to her --

Jill reads the name, address -- looks up

puzzled--

BACKSTAGE

as Morris and The Time pass Prince on

their way to the stage--

The Band Members bust up -- but Prince

ignores them, then--

CLUB

Sudden APPLAUSE and CRIES.  Vanity and

Jill turn directly into the path of

Prince, descending the Steps of the

stage.  Vanity gasps, LOCKS eyes with

him.  Jill seems to jump out of her skin

-- it's obvious she has a crush on him

something  awful--

She fidgets uncontrollably, Vanity's

card buring a hole into her hand.

Prince glances at the card, then stares

at Vanity,  the ripeness of her look

paralyzing.   He tears his eyes away,

puts on his sunglesses, looks toward the

stage.

MORRIS and The Time rip into a funk tune

called "Jungle Love." Their stranglehold

on the audience is instantaneous.

Morris struts across the stage like a

panther, playing to the audience with a

relish.  His eyes fastened on Prince --

his pride umistakable.

PRINCE watches Morris a moment, then

eyes Vanity again.  The heat between

them is apparent.  Vanity's heart is

pounding, she's not sure what to do.

She keeps her eyes on Morris, hoping

that a Solution will present itself.

PRINCE watches as Jill tacks the card to

a board behind the bar.  Sizing up the

situation quickly, he again glances at

Vanity -- but her eyes are fastened on

Morris.  Feeling terribly shy and

thinking there's nothing he can do to

divert her attention away from him, he

reluctantly heads for the front door.

Vanity finally hits upon something to

say, turns--

But he's gone.  Her eyes scan the room

frantically -- catches a glimpse of him

leaving.  She takes a sudden step, then

stops, paralyzed with indecision.  Jill

regards ger coldly.

MORRIS meanwhile is beside himself.

Some gorgeous, dark-haired babe, eyes

wide as saucers was starlng at him from

the bar.  Prince has left, and this girl

is his.  He motions to Jerome,  and they

direct their act in her direction.

JILL gazes at Vanity, fidgets intensely,

suspicious and resentful of her.   She

glances up and notices Morris, look.

She seizes upon an idea,  forces a

friendly smile, taps Vanity on the

shoulder--

She points to the stage.  Vanity looks

at Morris, and he goes crazy,

entertaining her with his own special

blend of showmanship.  The CROWD loves

it!  Vanity is held a moment, but her

thouchts are elsewhere. She finally

comes to a decision, pulls away, cuts

through the club.

as she runs down the stairs, cuts behind

Chick, BURSTS out the door.

FRANTIC!  The STREETS are thick with

TRAFFIC.  She scans them wildly --

nothing.  Suddenly Prince, astride his

motorcycle, BLAZES past her from the

opposite direction.  She starts running,

shouts--

But Prince is too far away, the traffic

too coneested for him to hear.  He whips

down the street, disappears around the

corner.

Vanity continues running, then slows,

dejection overcoming her in waves.  She

looks around -- KIDS are staring at her,

passing  jokes.  Embarrassed, She moves

to the front door but Chick is there,

his eyes upon her cold, impassionate.

Exhausted and slighlty tearlul, she cuts

across the street, heads back to her

apartment.

Prince WHIPS down the street, cuts his

motor, coasts up the drive. He comes to

a stop against a wooden gate.  His house

is a nondescript, one-family structure

with a wide front porch.  He lives in a

neat and tidy, homogeneous, lower middle-

class neighborhood whose occupants are

hard-working type fiercely protective of

their privacy.

He climbs the steps to the porch, opens

the front door...

...his mothers SCREAM is like ice in his

veins.  Fear trickles into the hollows

of his body like cold water,  His pain

commands him to move, but the impulse

short circuits somewhere at the waist,

leaving his legs twitching

uncontrollably.  Then another SCREAM

from his mother, and his father's voice

now, LOUD and FURIOUS--

WHACK!  His mother SCREAMS -- Prince

BURSTS into the room.

(21) INT. Prince's LIVING ROOM --  NIGHT

Prince's MOTHER is at the far side of

the living room CRYING uncontrollable.

She's in her early 40's, a dark-haired,

faded beauty, with large, wild, anxious

eyes.  There's a detectable scent of

liquor in the air, and her slurred

speech pins her as the source.

His FATHER is in his late 40's, a squat,

but solidly built black man, with a

cherubic face, and graceful expressive

hands.

He's upon her now, WHACKING! at her

horribly, trying to get to her face--

WHACK!

WHACK!

The Father lunges, WHACKS! her across

the face.  She topples to the floor, a

lamp CRASHES to the ground.  Prince cuts

through the room, lunges desperately in

front of him--

His Mother drags herself up along the

wall--

WHACK!   Prince's head snaps back, his

feet lift from the floor, his body

CRASHES in a heap by the door...

Stunned SILENCE.  Prince, flat on his

back, fights vertigo with everything

he's got.  His Mother lets out a YELP,

rushes into the bedroom, SLAMS the door.

His Father stands motionless, sullen--

Prince opens his Mouth, BLOOD gushes

from a gash in his tongue.  He hoists

himself up slowly, using the wall for

support.  He moves into the kitchen,

disappears down the basement steps.

A naked LIGHT BULB snaps ON.  It dangles

like a pendulum, casting strange

shadows.  The basement is partitioned

off into a series of rooms,

interconnected by a labyrinthine

coimbination of passages.  An old washer

and dryer stand in the corner.

Prince descends the steps slowly.  He

comes through a door, closes it behind

him.  He moves down a narrow passageway,

enters a small cramped BEDROOM.

He closes the door and locks it behind

him.  MOONLIGHT filters in throuch the

cacement windows.  The total effect is

like entering a womb, a deep dark

chamber of security and safety.

Lying heavily onto his bed, he sighs

long and deep, his eyes piercing the

darkness...

FADE OUT:

FADE IN:

MUSIC wafts through the sun-drenched

CLUB.   Jill is seated at the PIANO, 'a

la Marlene Dietrich, SINGING to her

heart's content.  A cigarette dangles

from her lip, a police cap is perched

jauntily on her head.  It's a simple bar

tune, delivered slightly off-key, but

with an openness that is endearing.

Chick is working in the corner,

chuckling to himself, stacking chairs,

sweeping up.

Suddenly she stops -- listens intently.

She jumps up, deliberately spills her

orange juice on the piano. Prince comes

around the corner, stops short--

She's a bundle of loose, embarrassing

ends -- the cigarette, hat,  juice--

He feels caught out -- SCANS the BOARD

earnestly for Vanity's info   -- tries

to think of something to say--

He smiles, moves to the door -- Jill

connects with a thought--

She rumages through her bag, pulls out a

cassette--

He stiffens, doesn't reach for it--

He puts his sunglasses on, hesitates,

then takes it from her gingerly.  He

regards it for a long time--

MUSIC throbs throuch the crammed,

rundown REHEARSAL HALL.  Hardwood

floors, a wall of mirrors, and a bank of

windows provides the setting.  SUNLIGHT

streams through tattered yellow shades.

The Time is set up on one side providing

the music for "Sex Shooter" a saucy

number with an irresistible beat.

Morris, with Jerome by his side, stands

in the middle of the floor, SHOUTS

instructions to...

...BRENDA and SUSAN, gamely trying some

intricate dance steps.  Brenda is 21

years old, blond, sexy, with an alluring

new-wave look.  Susan is 16 years old,

with dark, lustrous hair and a sexy baby-

doll quality. Right now they're tired as

hell, and a little angry--

The MUSIC stops, the girls come to a

halt -- Morris regards them evenly--

Morris glares at her--

The Girls  fidget--

The MUSIC starts up -- the Girls start

dancing.  Morris looks woefully to

Jerome---

Morris and Jerome move briskIy down the

sidewalk--

Morris snaps an address in front of his

face--

Suddenly  a BEAUTIFUL BABE lunges into

the sidewalk from the alley--

Jerome puts the girl in a headlock,

DRAGS her into the alley--

He flings her into the dumpster, SLAMS

the lid with a CRASH.  Morris pats his

brow--

They streak across the street, double-

time it to the CADDY.  A COP sweeps by,

gives them a curious look.  Morris puts

on a dignified air, then stops,

stupified--

Morris is pondering his Stacy Adams--

Morris sits in the chair, his Stacy

Adams worked on by an old, grizzled

SHOESHINE BOY in his mid-sixties, with

large jowls and silver close-cropped

hair.  Jerome stands nearby, watches

intently--

The Shoeshine Boy looks up balefully --

Morris smiles, then grits his teeth--

The Shoeshine Boy looks  up slowly --

regards them with a soulfull look--

The SIDEWALKS are alive with bustling

SHOPPERS.  Vanity walks aimlessly past

store windows, staring longingly at the

expensive items.

as she stops suddenly and stares

transfixed.  A YOUNG WOMAN, startingly

similiar to her in looks and coloring,

tries on a beautiful bridal gown as a

SEAMSTRESS adjusts the hem.  The entire

scene is warm and endearing.  Vanity is

struck by lt's beauty and seems to sigh.

The Young Woman looks up suddenly,

catches Vanity's gaze, and gives her an

affectionate smile.  Vanity smiles back

avidly, then--

She looks up startled--

She looks  down -- it's the expensive

gold chain.  She hesitates, then hands

it to him.  He drops it into his pocket,

walks away--

She runs after him--

He continues to walk briskly -- she

starts pulling on his coat--

He moves away briskly -- Vanity stands

her ground, amused--

He stops short -- something has caught

his eye.  She's curious, comes up behind

him, then--

He puts on his sunglasses.  A GUITAR

stands prominently in the window.

He flips her the gold chain' -- turns

hastily.  She weighs it in her hand,

studies the guitar--

Prince and Vanity on his MOTORCYCLE

blazing down the HIGHWAY, twisting

through TRAFFIC.  The CITY is behind

them, receding into the distance.

They pull off an access road, drop down

a small embankment, ride down a narrow,

dirt road.

LAKESIDE

The pull to a stop.  A LAKE stretches

before them.  Vanity gets off the bike,

walks around exploring, casting curious

glances at Prince.  He stands by the

water, idly tossing stones--

He doesn't respond -- she suddenly feels

shy--

She stretches her arms like a butterfly,

does a little step--

She's Perplexed--

Her brow furrows, she looks out across

the lake.  He's calmly throwing stones.

Recognizing a challenge when she sees

one, she formulates a plan, faces him

seductively, shoots him an open look.

He stops suddenly, locks eyes with her,

feels his knees go weak.  Her hold on

him is unmistakable.  She pulls off her

blouse in one fluid motion, tugs off her

boots, drops her pants to the ground.

She's exquisite, takes a step toward

him.  Passion rings in his veins ...

Suddenly she turns on her   heels, moves

purposefully toward the water.  He's

shocked,  realizes that she's about to

go in--

But she silences him savagely--

And before he can react she scampers

along a log, DIVES beneath the surface.

He can't believe it -- her spirit really

impresses him.  She breaks the surface

coughing and sputtering, hops and jumps

to the shore--

He tries to keep a straight face, jumps

on his motorcvcle, STARTS it up.  His

words take a moment to sink in, then--

She gathers up her clothes, tries

desperately to put them on.  She slips

and falls -- Prince can't help laughing-

-

She starts throwing stones.  He laughs,

blasts up the path--

ACCESS ROAD

He blazes up the embankment, SAILS

through the air, drops expertly onto the

road.  He fishtails to a slick stop.

Vanity is by the lake, flailing about,

throwing things, trying to get into her

boots--

He laughs heartily, wants to kid her,

rides down the road as if he's leaving.

Having his fun, he slows, turns to go

back ...

...his smile dissolves instantly.

Vanity is in the middleof the road,

flagging down a small PICKUP TRUCK.  She

hops in, slams the door.  The truck

peels out, bears down upon him.   He

gesticulates his arms wildly --  wants

to explain--

But the truck streaks past -- Vanity's

look is cold, triumphant.

MUSIC.  The CLUB is PACKED!  THE MODERN

AIRES is onstage, a hi-techno funk

group, performing their trademark, a

frenzied song entitled "Modern Aire"

The floor is dense with KIDS, all

performing the same syncopated dance.

PRINCE moves through the club slowly,

seems to be searching someone out.  His

face is drawn and haggard, his spirits

strained.  He cuts past the BAR, barely

acknowledges Jill, or the other

WAITRESSES by her side, KIM and KATY.

Jill looks concerned--

Kim is 21 years and gorgeous, with dark

eyes, a smooth sculpted face, and taut

shapely legs.  She is street-educated

and doesn't need encouraging to speak

her mind.  Katy is also in her-early

20's, a tall, alluring Oriental, with an

attractive, intelligent face--

Matt and Bobby (members of Prince's

group) stroll up--

Matt stares hungrily at her breasts--

She swats him with her order pad --

Bobby ducks, taunts her--

She goes to swing, Matt moves in,

squeezes her breasts--

The Guys bust up, head for their tables-

-

Vanity stands in line waiting to get in.

She wears a short, black dress and red

heels, carries a black and red

clutchbag.  Her hair is swept back and

wind-blown, her eyes dark and dancing.

She looks wickedly wonderful and knows

it.

CHICK stands by the window, arms folded,

as massive as a Sequoia.  He regards her

suspiciously--

Chick advances on her -- her eyes widen

with fear--

She breaths a sigh of relief.

JEROME watches as Chick escorts Vanity

to the upper level.  He stays short

distance behind.

as Vanity and Chick come to a  halt in

the middle of the f Ioor--

Chick walks away.  Jerome makes a move

toward her, but pulls himself up short -

- BILLY SPARKS has approached her--

Vanity turns around -- her eyes widen

with surprise--

He's 38 years old, 5'3" tall and weighs

about 180 pounds.  He's dressed in a

baby-blue running suit.and white tennis

shoes that come to a point.  A dark-

skinned, smooth-faced black man, he's

wearing small, white sunglasses and a

base-ball cap perched on his head.  Fred

Flintstone in Harlem.  A hip, fast-

talking jive motherfucker who uses

profanity like a light saber.  Chubby,

cuddly, cherubic Billy Sparks.  He'd

sell his mother if he thought he could

make a buck.

They size one another up in. about three

seconds--

Billy lights a cigarette, offers her

one, she accepts--

Jerome appears--

Vanity sees her escape--

They BOTH look at her surprised--

Jerome goes along with it--

She walks away with Jerome, arm in arm--

Prince and his band (Mark, Bobby, Matt,

Lisa) sit backstage, waiting to go on.

An air of tension permeates the room.

Lisa sits in the corner and fidgets,

casts sidelong looks to Prince.  He sits

apart from the group, deathly silent,

locked in thouqht.

Wendy walks in and shares a look with

Lisa.  She goes up to Prince, her voice

filled with nervousness--

He stares at her -- if looks could kill

Wendy would be dead--

Prince grunts, turns away -- Wendy is

amazed--

But Wendy, agitated, silences her with a

fierce gesture--

Wendy is shaking, tears spring to her

eyes--

They leave the room, Wendy SLAMS the

door behind her.  Prince casts a look to

Bobby, Mark, Matt--

Thud.  The joke hangs suspended like a

ball and chain.  Bobby gets up, the

others follow him to the door--

They cut out the door.

Bobby, Matt and Mark move briskly to the

stage--

Matt dons his surgeon's mask -- Mark

rolls his eyes--

(35) INT/BACKSTAGE ENTRANCE/CLUB -- NIGHT

Morris stands by the door surrounded by

several delicious BABES.  One of them,

wearing a tight, red dress, looks

especially enticing.  Morris leans in

closer -- her tasty breasts strain

against the spandex material--

Jerome appears--

Be snaps his head to the side -- Morris

looks, sees Vanity sitting at a table.

His eyes dance mischievously--

as Prince sits by himself in front of

the mirror, staring at a cassette on the

counter.  We recognize it immediately as

the tape Jill gave him earlier,

containing Lisa's and Wendy's music.  He

picks it up, snaps it into a ghetto

blaster.  MUSIC, without lyrics, fills

the room.  He adjusts the dials, sits

back and listens a moment.  Suddenly the

door opens--

Be snaps off the music, drops the

cassette into his pocket, cuts out the

room.

He comes to the stage-area.  His

Band.Members are standing about

anxiously, watching the final moments of

The Modern Aires' performance.  He cuts

behind the curtain, peers at the

crowd...

...his eyes fall on Vanity -- his face

brightens instantly.  Just then Jerome

and Morris approach her.  Prince shakes

his head knowingly, offers a wry smile,

then joins his band.

She sits demurely.  Morris' eyes are

wide and shining -- her beauty up close

astonishes him--

she offers her hand -- he takes it

decorously--

Morris signals him -- whispers into his

ear--

He seats himself, fastens her with a

sexy, half-lidded look--

Kim appears with a bottle of champacne

in ice--

Jerome appears, opens the bottle with a

flair, performs a classy taste test.

Morris pulls out some cash, pays him,

who snatches the money, leaves--

He whispers to Jerome--

Jerome leaves, Morris purses his lips--

He leans in, speaks with a sexy voice--

He folds his legs dramatically, his

Stacy Adams reflecting the light--

Just then--

The CLUB erupts in CRIES!  Prince hits

the stage, launches into "G-spot," a

fast, high-spirited funk tune that gets

the crowd hopping.  Vanity watches as

Prince whips the crowd into a frenzy.

Morris listens with a complacent grin on

his face, his eyes searching out various

members of The Time who are scattered

through-out the club.  When he connects

with one of them he makes a series of

absurd faces which sends them into

hysterics.  For Prince is playing music

that The Time is noted for, and, as far

as Morris is concerned, performs better.

Not everyone in the club is dancing, or

paying attention, and this does not

escape his notice.

Suddenly "G-Spot" comes to a rousing

end.  The CROWD cheers wildly.  Prince

moves quickly to the piano and launches

into "Electric Intercourse," a love

ballad which, as it progresses, becomes

a personal statement for Vanity and

Prince himself.

She listens intently, her eyes fastened

on him.  The words have a profound

effect on her -- and the audience.

Without being consciously aware of it,

they're moving closer to the stage,

searching for their personal fix. Prince

surrenders himself to the music totally,

releasing from himself all that is

hurtful -- releasing the sincerity and

truthfulness that escapes him in his

daily life.  We are entering  realm

where life and music are inextricably

bound, and the impact on the performer

and listener is profound.

He's directing his music toward her, and

she receives it gratefully, almost

anxiously.  It fills a void in her, hewn

by a life of meaningless promises.  He

searches her face with his magnificent

eyes, and ends the song with a

heartrending cry which connects with the

souls of all present.  Everyone is

paying attention now.

The stage is plunged into darkness.  The

CROWD goes CRAZY!  Vanity applauds

vigorously, wipes the tears from her

eyes.  Morris, who was more affected by

the performance than he'd care to admit,

doesn't like what he sees and searches

for a winning line--

She's equal to the challenge--

But Morris can barely suppress a smile,

and settles himself comfortably into his

chair -- for he knows what Vanity has

lost...at least this round--

She flashes him a quizzical look -- he

simply smiles.

Jubilation time!  Prince and his Band

move through the hallway briskly, past

the outstretched arms of admiring fans.

There's a lot of back-slapping going on

as the Musicians bask in the glow of

well-wishers.  Prince moves past Billy

Sparks, who has an angry look on his

face--

But Prince ignores him, cuts into the

dressing room--

--then stops suddenly, surprised.  He's

muzzle to muzzle with a cuddly DOG, held

up lovingly by Jill--

OOHS! and AAHS!  by  the entire group.

Jill hesitates, then kisses Prince's

cheek compulsively.  He's surprised,

touched--

She fidgets, her face blushes red.

Wendy is studying the dog--

Everyone looks -- Jill grins like the

Cheshire Cat--

She thrusts the dog into his arms -- the

Band laughs uproariously.  Jill is

beaming--

Prince gazes into the mirror -- and sure

enough the dog's hair has been groomed

to match his.  He can't help smiling--

He grabs the dog, 'a la The Werewolf,

starts chomping on it's neck.  The Group

busts up, starts fooling around.

Prince glances into the mirror -- Vanity

is there.  He whirls around to the door

-- nothing.  A huge smile sweeps his

face instead.  The Band continues

fooling around, and Prince joins in with

a relish.

Vanity leans against a brick wall,

hiding in the shadows.  Suddenly

FOOTSTEPS approach.  Prince appears,

gets on his Motorcycle--

He doesn't look up--

She's embarrassed by her apartment--

He averts his eyes -- kick STARTS his

bike--

He remains silent, snaps the bike into

gear, blasts down the ally into the

street.

Prince and Vanity whip down a

residential street.  As he approaches

his house he slows, moves past it

quietly.

He makes a deft U-turn, crosses his

house again -- seems to be listening

intently...

After a moment, he cuts down a narrow

path, turns up a back alley.  He rides

to a wooden gate, detaches a hidden

lever.  The wood slats rotate like a

garage door -- Prince coaxes his bike

through.

BACKYARD

Vanity's mesmerized.  They ride down a

narrow sidewalk, cut through a garden,

and emerge from the back of a garage.

He leans his bike against it--

He silences her with a look, moves

quickly across the grass, comes to a

window.  He stands on a pipe, looks in--

His Mother and Father in the living

room.  His Mother is sprawled out on the

sofa, obviously drunk, her dress hiked

along her thighs.  Her head rests in his

Father's lap.

Prince hops from the pipe, leans coolly

against the house. Intrigued. Vanity

looks in--

The mother and father kissing

tentatively, then violently, finally

pulling away.  The Mother seems to be

taunting the Father, coaxing him into a

trap.  He kisses her mouth lustily --

she pulls back snarling--.

Vanity's scared -- tries to be cool--

He walks off.  She jumps off the pipe,

follows.

SIDE OF HOUSE

as they emerge around the corner.

Prince squats by a basement window,

adjusts an old coal chute, then slides

down it--

She hesitates a moment, then slides down

too.

He turns on a LIGHT, disappears into an

ADJOINING ROOM.  Vanity looks around

amazed.  She stands in a small ANTE-

CHAMBER whose walls are covered with

thicks pads and foam.

Colorful MOBILES hang suspended from the

ceilings -- various INSTRUMENTS lie

about: a drumset, an electric guitar,

and a small upright piano.  A stereo and

cassette player. are perched on a shelf,

and  two speakers are recessed into the

walls.  The entire room looks hand-

built, the wood carefully painted, or

stained.

She peers through the doorway into the

adjoining room.  BLUE MOONLIGHT filters

in through the casement windows.

Various MURALS are painted on the walls,

MOBILES are suspended from the ceiling.

A bed sits in the middle of the floor, a

vanity table and mirror nearby.

She stands idly a mement, then moves

around the antechamber.  Various

KNICKNACKS catch her attention. Small

wind-up TOYS lie about:  a soldier, a

bear banging on a drum, a tractor and

car.  A small MUSIC BOX sits on a shelf.

She turns the handle, a little TUNE

fills the room...

A cassette sits in the player.  She

snaps it shut, hits the play button.  A

DRUM BEAT fills the room, followed by a

WOMAN'S VOICE, seemingly speaking in a

foreign tongue.  The combination is

hypnotic and sensual -- she finds

herself drawn in ...

Suddenly Prince grabs her by the waist,

lets out a SHRIEK.  She draws a out

breath, jumps--

He puts his index finger directly in

front of her nose, moves it back and

forth hypnotically.  She follows it

earnestly with her eyes.  Suddenly, he

pulls his hand away, stretches it to the

ceiling like an escaping bird.  They

both smile, lock eyes.  Passion rings in

their veins...

The Woman's VOICE begins to moan deeply,

pleasurably--

Heat floods into her womb like soft fire-

-

She touches his chest delicately, fluffs

up his hair--

She hesitates -- but he reaches out

tentatively, touches her breast--

But their mutual desire is too strong.

Their lips seek one another out timidly,

almost deferentially...then fervently.

DISSOLVE TO:

Vanity sits at the foot of the bed,

Prince stands before her.  Her dress is

hiked along her thighs, her stockings

attached to garters.  Their hands search

delicately across the contours of their

bodies, drawing quick breaths from their

lips.  They kiss one another ardently,

then quickly, like sparrows pecking

seed.  She goes to remove her dress, but

Prince stays her with a gesture, moving

his hands along her thighs, touching

delicately that spot between her legs.

A low, whispery moan escapes from her

lips.

Vanity lies back, drawing Prince toward

her.  His lips move across her mouth,

her neck, her breasts.  She moans

softly, pulls her dress above her

thighs, goes to remove it.  Once again

he stops her, slowly turns her onto her

stomach.

She stands.on her knees, her head

resting on a pillow.  His hands move up

along the back of her thighs, past the

garters to her panties.  He tugs at them

gently, then rubs his hand firmly

between her legs.  She moans suddenly,

the shudder moving through her like a

whirlwind ...

DISSOLVE TO:

MOONLIGHT glows throuch the casement

windows.  MOBILES stir gently in the

night breeze.

Prince and Vanity are asleep.  He rests

on his side, his hands gently surporting

his face.  She lies behind him, one leg

dangling off the bed, one shoe discarded

on the floor

Suddenly a distant MOAN...QUICK

FOOTSTEPS -- A DOOR SLAMS.  Vanity SNAPS

awake! Fear sweeps her like a shadow

from a passing cloud.  She listens

intently, then--

-- Another DOOR SLAM, QUICK FOOTSTEPS,

and Prince's Mother

A bottle CRASHES to the floor.  Then

silence...

...deep silence like snow in the room...

Vanity's racked with fear.  She sits up

slowly, her eyes searching out Prince --

he's sleeping...

WHACK!  Something heavy CRASHES to the

floor...

Vanity rises from the bed in a panic!

She smoothes down her dress, searches

for her other shoe.  She shoots another

look to Prince, but he sleeps

peacefully.  Casting a glance upstairs,

she climbs throuch the casement window,

disappears into the night.

PRINCE is resting on his side, his eyes

opened.

Vanity moves quickly along the side of

the house, trying desperately to find

her wav.  Suddenly a HAND reaches out of

the darkness, GRABS her by the throat.

She SCREAMS, swings her bag desperately

-- something CRASHES, into the bushes--

She sees it's Morris -- she's beside

herself  with fear and rage--

He struggles in the bushes -- DOGS start

BARKING--

They cut across the yard, head to the

street.  The CADDY is parked at the

curb.  Jerome leans against it, reading

a newspaper--

He grins proudly from ear to ear -- the

Caddy sports new chrome wire wheels--

Morris MOANS dismally--

His shoes are badly scuffed, the leather

torn across the top--

Just then a PATROL CAR cruises by.  The

COP regards them suspiciously.  Morris

and Jerome snap to attention--

They pile into the Caddy, pull out.

The CADDY blazes by in the night.  The

CITY LIGHTS glimmer spectacularly in the

distance.

Jerome drives.  Morris and Vanity sit in

the backseat. He gazes at her ardently--

Jerome snaps a look in the rear-view --

Morris gives him a deft nod. Jerome

opens the glove compartment, searches

through the cassette tapes. He finds the

one he wants, snaps it into the player.

RESTAURANT AMBIANCE fills the car...

Note:  The restaurant ambiance will grow

in volume, and will be followed by

exaggerated dinner music, punctuated

with strings and delicate cymbals.  The

MUSIC plays throughout this scene -- and

Morris times his words to the ebb and

flow of the piece to insure the proper

dramatic effect.

...dinner MUSIC begins--

Jerome braces his knees against the

wheel, pours two premixed coladas into

plastic glasses--

Jerome stifles a laugh, pours a rum

miniature into Morris' glass.  He hands

them back--

They savor their drinks -- Morris'

fervor grows by leaps and bounds--

Jerome places a pad by his side, pencil

at the ready. He settles the Caddy to a

cruising 55 -- Morris looks deeply into

Vanity's eyes--

He takes Vanity's drink, slurps a

little, burps--

She does, and begins coughing violently-

-

He leans close to her, speaks in a soft,

sexy voice--

She giggles, looks at him deeply--

An idea flashes across his mind--

He slides a large glass diamond on her

finger--

He studies her hands closely--

He leans close to her--

She giggles freely, looks at him with

big eyes--

Jerome checks off his pad--

Morris fixes Vanity with his half-

lidded, pouty-lip look--

She's on the spot, thinks fast--

Jerome SKIDS the car to a stop.  They're

directly in front of a slick, hi-rise

apartment building--

He smiles lovingly--

Jerome hands Morris a cassette -- Morris

waves it in front of her nose--

Jerome and Moris suppress their laughter-

-

Jerome hands him a card with an address

on it.  Morris hands the card to her--

Vanity reads the card--

She gets out of the car, stands on the

sidewalk.  Morris pushes the window

button -- nothing happens--

Jerome leans over, taps the glass -- the

window glides down--

Jerome snaps the glove compartment,

hands Morris a neatly folded camisole.

Morris presents it to her--

He snaps his fingers -- Jerome pulls the

Caddy away with a screech.

Vanity stands on the sidewalk a moment,

slightly bewildered and very amused.

She watches the Cadillac screech around

the bend.  She turns, goes into the

motel.

PRINCE stands in the alleyway across the

street, his motorcycle parked nearby.

He watches as Vanity cuts inside.

(55)  INT. HALLWAY/VANITY'S MOTEL -- DAWN

She comes down the HALLWAY, opens her

door with a key.

She goes inside, drops the tape and card

in her bureau. unfolding the camisole,

she holds it against her, gazes into the

mirror.  It looks beautiful.  Suddenly a

KNOCK at the door--

Another two KNOCKS, something like a

confirmation.  She smiles, cuts to the

door, flings it open -- but Prince is

there. She's shocked, but recovers

instantly--

His face remains placid as he puts on

his sunglasses--

She stares at the camisole in her hands-

-

He nods dispassionately, walks into the

room, gives the place the once over,

then--

AERIAL SHOT

Prince and Vanity on his motorcycle

whipping down the highway.  The DAWN

LIGHT breaks over the horizon.

A SERIES OF SHOTS

Streaking down a two-lane blacktop

obviously exhilarated by the velocity of

their ride.  The landscape becomes lush,

the trees a riot of autumn splendor.

ANOTHER ANGLE

as Prince and Vanity whip up to the top

of a small hill, skid to a stop.  He

scans the area quickly, gets his

bearings.  He pops the clutch, skids off

to the valley below.

PRINCE AND VANITY ride cautiously

through a series of hiking paths, then

twist down a small embankment.  A STREAM

flows before them.  They climb off the

bike, look around quietly--

He waits for an answer, it's not

forthcoming--

He goes to the stream, balances on

several rocks, moves to the other side.

The stream flows between them--

She starts a little dance step, climaxes

it with spins and twirls--

He can't help laughing -- she freezes,

looks at him coldly--

He smiles, walks off--

He disappears around some trees--

PRINCE moves through the trees smiling,

studying nature--

He comes to a tree, leans against it

contentedly, studies the foliage.

VANITY paces back and forth frantically

along the stream--

PRINCE rests by the tree, observes TWO

HIKERS walking down the path toward him-

-

The Hikers pass him startled--

VANITY is standing by his side, a

wildflower in her hands--

He takes the flower, slips it into his

jacket, kisses her forehead.

as they ride down a leaf-strewn path and

pull to a stop near an old, weathered,

dilapidated BARN.  It stands laarge and

silent like a painting.  A low THUNDER

rolls across the land...

DAWN LIGHT burns through the wooden

slats.. STEAM rises from the wet hay

scattered throughout.  The air is thick

and damp.  It begins to RAIN.

Vanity stands in the middle of the barn,

gazing at the storm.  Beads of

perspiration glisten on her forehead.

She turns slowly, watches as Prince

retrieves old blankets from a nearby

stall.  Their eyes search one another

out, their breathing becomes short,

expectant.  She hesitates a moment, then

pulls off her blouse, discards it to the

moist, dusty floor.

ANOTHER ANGLE

RAIN patters srtongly against the barn.

A deep THUNDER rolls.  She's on top of

him, moving deliciously, her body

glowing in the purple, dawn light.

Moist, purple water shadows streak and

course her skin as she moves slowly,

then deliberately against him.  He

watches her avidly,  his hands firmly on

her thighs, and thrusts into her again

and again...and again.

Leaves scatter as the bike whips thru

the wet path.

The STREETS glisten with the rain.

Prince and Vanity pull up in front of

her motel.  She hugs him fiercely, steps

off the bike, her face alive and fresh

as a flower.  His eyes sparkle--

He kicks the bike into gear -- she

touches his jacket longingly--

He blasts off.  She watches him a

moment, her eyes glowing.  She heads to

her motel, then stops short -- a single

CARNATION lies oon the sidewalk.  She

looks around quickly, almost expecting

someone to claim it.  But no one's

around, so she picks it up, goes inside.

She enters the LOBBY, closes the door

behind her.  She turns -- another

CARNATION is on the stairwell.  She's

intrigued, glances up the stairs --

there's another one, and yet another

further up.  She's confused, but grabs

them, disappears up the stairs.

HALLWAY

as she comes to a halt outside her room,

picking up carnations along the way.

She opens her door, cuts inside.

She goes into the bathroom, fills the

sink with water, arranges the flowers

within.  She smiles radiantly -- they

look beautiful.  Suddenly something

seizes her thoughts.  She opens her

bureau drawer quickly, pulls out the

yellow pages, leafs through it

hurriedly, We READ: Parking, Passport,

Paving...then Pawnbrokers.  She stops,

runs her finger down the page, then

hunts quickly through her drawer.  Her

eyes dance mischievously when she pulls

out her gold chain.  She places it on

her bureau, hurries to her clothes rack.

Suddenly, a quick KNOCK at the door--

She looks around the corner -- a flower

delivery MAN stands in the hallway,

holding a bouquet of roses--

He cuts inside, and is followed by

another MAN, holding a bouquet of

daisies--

The Men leave the room--

She hurries to the window, looks out--

(66) EXT. STREET -- DAY -- VANITY'S POV--

Morris and Jerome standing by the curb,

their eyes fastened excitedly on her

window, leaning against a flower truck.

We catch a glimpse of a Man bringing her

a dozen chrysanthemums--

(INTERCUT)

She shakes her head--

She disappears from the window.  They

stand expectantly a long time.  Finally

Jerome looks at Morris--

Morris is staring intently at the window

-- he purses his lips sensualy--

Just then Vanity steps outside, looks

stunning in her tight, black pants and

boots.  Her eyes dance vivaciously, a

red sash is tied around her waste.

Morris gives Jerome his sexy, half-

lidded, pouty-lip look--

(68) INT. CLUB (1ST AVE. ST. BAR.) -- DAY

CU--Clock.  We SEE 11:25

Prince cuts through the back entrance,

walks onto the floor.  Lisa and Wendy

are onstage PLAYING a SONG we

immediately recognize as the one they

had given Prince to listen to.  The DRUM

RIFF is provided by the Linn Machine (a

synthesized drum unit).  Wendy plays

guitar, her back to Prince.  Lisa, at

the keyboards, spots him and stops--

Lisa points to Prince.  Wendy

immediately rips into the guitar solo of

"G-Spot."  She stops suddenly--

He ignores her--

Lisa immediately launches into the

opening bars of "Let's Get Crazy"--

The Girls bust up -- he glares at them--

Wendy meets his glare with one of her

own...

She turns, snaps off the Linn Machine

angrily, plunging the club into silence.

The Time is JAMMING like MAD, deep in

the heart of "Sex Shooter."  Brenda and

Susan move furiously to the beat, trying

their best to get it right.  They are

watched by ...

...Morris, Vanity  and Jerome standing

off to the side.  Morris has a contented

look on his face, even though his girls

are screwing up.  Vanity's eyes are wide

with excitement

CU--Clock.  We See: 8:15.

Prince sits, on his bed, staring at the

clock, seemingly lost in thoucht.  He

gets up, rummages through his coat

pockets, pulls out Lisa's and Wendy's

tape.  He snaps it into the player,

settles back.

MUSIC fills the room.  He listens

intently a moment, his face placid.  He

closes his eyes, tries to relax ...

Suddenly a DOOR SLAMS in the far reaches

of the house.  Harsh FOOTSTEPS echo

through the upstairs hallway.  Prince

remains still, his eyes closed...

Then another deathly DOOR SLAM!  GLASS

dissolves in its frame and trickles to

the floor like icicles.  Resentment

surges in him like a tornado.  He rises

purposefully, turns the MUSIC up...

...And then his door SMASHES open and

his Mother LUNGES into the room in a

PANIC.  She flings herself onto his bed

as his Father streaks in and WHACKS!

WHACKS!  WHACKS!  at her with a strap,

SCREAMING at her with an ominous growl

of rage--

The Mother throws herself at him

drunkenly, starts slapping, scratching

at his face--

Prince claws desperately at his Father's

back--

The Mother stands on the bed SHRIEKING--

The Father lunges, drags Prince along

the floor, WHACKS! the Mother in the

face.  She topples in a heap to the bed.

He's over her now, breathing fire,

flailing about savagely--

He lunges, drop KICKS his Father with

everything he's got!  His Father SMASHES

backwards against the wall, slides to

his buttocks on the floor.  He sits

there dully, exhausted...spent.

Prince crawls up along the side of the

bed.  His Mother buries her head in the

pillow, choking back sobs--

His Father's eyes well with tears.  He

leans close to her, speaks softly--

His Father sighs wearily, pulls himself

to his feet.  He moves to the door--

He leaves the room, closes the door

behind him.

PRINCE stares at  the door a moment,

tears welling in his eyes.  His Mother

is motionless, whimpering softly.  A

scent of liquor permeates the air.

He moves toward her, reaches out

tentatively...

Suddenly she jumps up, starts pacing

franticaily--

She catches a glimpse of herself in the

mirror, stops--

She sits in front of the mirror, studies

her face, her eyes...her breasts--

She giggles, starts applying makeup--

She fixes him with a conspiratorial

look, whispers--

She makes funny, "jazzy" eyes at him,

then stops suddenly, staring.  His face,

mouth, eyes...a sudden stirring in her

loins.  Her lips part, she moistens them

unconsciously...

She turns from the mirror and stares at

him -- his look connects with her groin.

She rises suddenly, walks slowly toward

the bed, sits facing him--

She outlines the mole on his cheek with

a makeup pencil, then draws one on

herself.  She takes her earring off, and

puts it on his ear.  They are face to

face -- identical--

She looks at him drunkenly.  He tries to

hold it in, but can't.  A tear, hot and

hard as a bullet flows down his cheek.

She puts her index finger in front of

his face, moves it back and forth

hypnotically.   Suddenly she pulls her

hand away, stretches it to the ceiling

like an escaping bird.  He swallows,

tries to smile -- she leans close --

She gets up, leaves the room--

(71) EXT. PRINCE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT (LATER)

Vanity climbs over a fence, moves

through some bushes, emerges along side

Prince's house.  She has an excited,

ravenous look on her face.  She hurries

to the casement window, climbs into the

basement.

She drops down into the basement, turns

excitedly, leaps into Prince's arms--

She hugs him tight, showers him with

kisses, topples them both to the bed.

Laughing, hugging, kissing -- fast and

furious.  Suddenly she jumps up like a

panther, fluffs her hair wildly in the

mirror, fixes him with a wanton look.

His eyes devour her--

She moistens her lips, walks

lasciviously toward the bed, sits facing

him.  She laughs suddenly, pushes him

back...and they're at each other again -

- faces two inches apart;  touching,

whispering, kissing, hands searching --

shutting out the rocm, shutting out the

world...

She jumps up suddenly.  She can't be

contained!  She practically levitates--

She rushes to the coal chute, climbs

halfway through.  Prince, puzzled,

cracks up watching her ass and legs

dangling.  She drops back into the room,

holding a large PACKAGE.  His eyes

widen.  She struts to the bed, lays it

down majestically before him--

He starts peeling the tape off, careful

not to rip the paper.  Vanity's bursting

with excitement though, and demolishes

it in a flash!  He laughs, opens the lid

-- stares in shock--

we immediately recognize it as the one

they saw in the window. He's deliriously

happy, and speechless--

She shouts with delight, attacks him

again, pushing the guitar aside.  Fast,

furious kisses and he responds in kind.

They're twisted in a heap on the bed.

After a moment they come up for air,

stare at each other playfully. Something

flashes across his mind--

Her eyes widen.  He takes off his

Mother's earring, fastens it to her ear.

Eyes dancing, she jumps up, studies it

closely, in the mirror--

She twists around, kneels beside him,

showers him with bites and kisses.

Suddenly she stops--

His face  drops, shocked--

She backs away from  him, stands,

strikes a defensive stance--

He LUNGES savagely before he knows it!

His hand lashes out, SMASHES her in the

face.  She falls back, CRASHES into the

mirror.  She slips dully to the floor,

tries desperately to brace herself on a

chair--

He's horrified--

He helps her up, she turns away from him-

-

His heart staggers in his chest--

She  twists viciously--

She rushes into the antechamber, climbs

through the coal chute, disappears into

the night.

DISSOLVE TO:

Matt, Bobby and Mark are JAMMING

onstage.  Prince emerges from behind the

curtains.  He looks drawn.and haggard,

his face unshaven.  The Guys spot him,

and the MUSIC trickles to a stop.

Tension fills the room in an instant.

Mark glances at his watch, fixes Prince

with a disgusted look.

Prince climbs the steps to the stage,

cuts across it--

The Guys shrug, look away.  Prince

simmers a moment, straps on his guitar -

- immediately gets ear-splitting

FEEDBACK.  He stomps on the floor pedals

angrily.  Just then Chick comes up to

the stage--

as Billy cuts down the stairs quickly.

Prince, walking to meet him, pulls

himself up short--

Billy still moves -- Prince keeps up--

He stops abruptly at the front door,

studies Prince for a long time.  Then he

cuts outside.  Prince follows.

Rush hour TRAFFIC.  Billy sets the pace

down the sidewalk -- Prince keeps up--

Suddenly a HORN BLARES off screen.

Billy looks up -- a BEAUTIFUL BABE in a

black BMW waves--

The Babe pulls into the flow of traffic-

-

-

The BMW sweeps up to the curb.  Billy

opens the door, slides in--

The PLACE is JUMPING!  Once again The

Time is deep in the guts of "Sex

Shooter," but now there's a difference.

The MUSIC is fiercer and crisper -- the

BEAT tailored, more defined.

Morris and Jerome stand off to the side

sporting huge grins.  They're avidly

watching...

...Vanity, Susan, and Brenda dancing up

a fierce storm.  Vanity fronts the two

Girls and moves panther-like in front of

the mirrors...

She's a dynamo, her face drawn tightly,

her movements crisp and precise.  She

urges the Girls on, suggests and

cajoles, strengthening their resolve.

Sweat lathers their bodies and forms

rings on their Danskins.  The act is

still very rough, but the potential for

success can be felt.

PRINCE suddenly enters the hall.  Morris

spots him immediately and halts the

MUSIC.  The Girls dance on a moment,

then stop perplexed.  Vanity catches

Prince's look, shakes her head in

disbelief--

She's out of breath, waves him off--

A TITTER goes through the Band Members -

- Vanity wipes her face, fixes him with

a glare--

He grabs her suddenly, pulls her to the

door--

She pulls away savagely--

Morris is enraged--

Prince glares at him, cups his genitals-

-

The Band lets out a condescending GROAN

-- the tension rises

Jellybean, 6'4", 210 pounds, steps from

behind the drums, moves up behind Prince-

-

He lunges, grabs Vanity again -- she

SHRIEKS--

Jellybean lurches, grabs Prince in a

HEAIDLOCK, lifts him off his his feet.

Prince kicks at him wildly--

He twists Prince's head backwards,

SMASHES his body to the ground--

But Prince continues fighting him with

everything he's got!  Jellybean is

astonished--

He twists Prince's neck savagely,

SMASHES! his legs to the floor again and

again--

Vanity is crying--

Jellybean settles his weight on Prince,

twists his head down painfully, trying

to break the resistance he alone can

feel.  Prince remains silent, the anger

coursing through his body in tremors--

The Guys surround them, grabbing

Prince's arms, legs, and feet.  He's

like a trapped animal now--

They pick him up, move him toward the

door.  He resists them slightly, his

body lurching in fit and starts.

Suddenly he breaks free, faces them with

his back to he door.  But the Band

Members surround him, their wills

united, the obviousness of the situation

apparent to all.

He searches for Vanity's eyes, but she

can't face him and walks away.  Anger

again surges in his veins.  He cuts out

the door, SLAMS it behind him.

Prince WHIPS down a dirt access road

locked in thought, the pain and anger in

his eyes apparent.  Suddenly a TRAIN

WHISTLE BLASTS just behind him, sending

a shot of fear through his guts.

He twists backwards in amazement.  A

FREIGHT TRAIN ROARS around the bend

BLASTING its HORN violently.  Prince

shudders with fright, loses control of

his cycle for an instant.  He hits a

series of ruts that almost topple him to

the ground.

He looks back at the train confused,

when another BLAST seems to SOCK him in

the teeth.  He twists wildly to the side

of the road, kicking up dirt and debris,

lurching him into the handlebars

violently.

The TRAIN ROARS abreast of him!  Prince

snaps an angry look at the engineer.

The Guy coolly gives him the finger and

BLASTS the HORN violently.

Prince becomes enraged!  He snaps a look

to the speedometer: 65 mph.  He snaps a

look to the Engineer -- the Guy sends

him another obscene gesture and BLASTS

his HORN.

Prince grits his teeth, twists the

throttle full.  He lurches forward in an

instant, blazing in front of the train,

The Engineer BLASTS the HORN

mercilessly, and throws on the coals.

They blast down the stretch neck to

neck, twist round a wide bend.

Prince edges in front!  The Engineer

BLASTS the HORN and moves up.  Prince

snaps a look to him -- the Guy mouths

the words:  Fuck You!

Prince wants to scream!  He twists the

throttle, snaps a look to the

speedometer:  75 mph.  He RIPS past ruts

and gullies like a madman.  The TRAIN

moves up.  They blast around another

bend neck to neck

Suddenly Prince's eyes widen with

horror.  A CAR is parked across the

access road, waiting to cross the track.

He shoots a look to the Engineer -- the

Guy is laughing hysterically now,

BLASTING his HORN wildly, mouthing the

words:  Bye Bye!

Prince screams like  a MADMAN!  He

twists his  throttle FULL!  He blazes

ahead of the train, BLASTS! up the

embankment, SAILS through the air...

...a BRICK WALL cuts the access road in

two!

He SCREAMS in bloody terror!  He hits

the road and fishtails wildly, locking

his brakes.  The WALL comes at him like

a locomotive.  He's going to hit it,

knows it and...

He twists his throttle violently BLASTS!

directly into the path of the train!

The Engineer looks on in horror!  Prince

throws his weight forward and...

...the train ROARS past him as he

fishtails wildly to a stop.

The Engineer sails off into the dusk,

his mouth agape.  Prince sits there

breathing fiercely, the adrenaline

shrieking though his veins, watching

the train disappear into the distance.

He moves through the TRAFFIC slowly,

glides past a POLICE CAR, and a small

CROWD.  A CAR has run onto the sidewalk,

knocking down the marquee to a rundown,

neighborhood bar.

Something catches his eye -- he stops

suddenly.  His Mother stands against the

wall, idly watching the goings on.  He

jumps off his bike hurriedly, walks up

behind her, taps her on the shoulder--

She turns, he gasps out loud.  Her left

eye is swollen shut--

Her drunken breath washes over him --

his head spins--

She rubs up against him--

She gropes for him drunkenly -- he

suddenly realizes she doesn't know who

he is--

She tugs at her wedding ring--

Just then a COP moves through the Crowd-

-

The Crowd moves out.  Police RADIOS

cackle.  Three WOMEN stagger over, one

of them grabbing his Mother--

She fixes Prince with a glare--

Prince BLASTS down the STREET, sweeps

into his drive, and jumps off his bike,

practically smashing it into the gate.

His eyes are burning with anger.  He

flies up the steps three at a time, cuts

across the porch, bursts throuch the

front door and--

-- stalks through the living room, eyes

blazing--

He spins like a top, streaks down the

hallway, throws open several doors

violently--

He cuts into the kitchen raging--

He twists around frustrated; exhaustion,

anger, and pain competing for the same

space.  Suddenly he stops, listens

intently a moment.  We HEAR it now -- a

PIANO.  Someone's PLAYING A PIANO.

Prince throws a look at the basement

door -- it's ajar.

A naked LIGHT BULB snaps ON.  Prince

hesitates a moment, descends the steps,

pauses at the door.  The MUSIC wafts

delicately in the night breeze.  He

moves down the halllway uncertainly, but

steadily, the MUSIC growing, drawing him

in.

He stops, peers into the antechamber.

His Father is at the piano, his back to

him.  He's perched on the broken stool,

playing with all he's got.

Prince moves slowly into the room, his

knees weakening, his anger flowing from

him with every step he takes.  Seeing

his Father this way, he doesn't know if

he should laugh or cry.  He sits down

silently behind him, listens as his

Father plays.

The SONG ends.  His Father sits a

moment, stretching his hands idly along

the keys.  Feeling a presence in the

room, he spins around and jumps slightly

at seeing his son.  He fixes him with a

threatening look, then shrugs, hunches

over the keys--

His Father looks at him sullenly, then

looks down, stares at the keys.

Prince's eyes well with tears--

His Father bites his his lip, rubs a

hand over his face, stares at the keys.

His voice comes with difficulty--

His Father shares a hurtful look with

him, then stares darkly at the floor

below--

The CLUB is THROBBING.  Prince is

onstage, stripped to the waist, SWEAT

seeping from his pores in torrents.

He's deep into the pit of "Computer

Blue, " locked into a provocative,

obscene graphic with Wendy. She's on her

knees in front of him, his crotch moving

directly in front of her lips.  She's

made up fiercely, looks like Prince

himself.  The total effect is unnerving

-- Prince is going down on himself.

Billy Sparks stands by the bar pretty

upset.  Jill stands slack-jawed.  The

KIDS have stopped dancing, drinking --

they staring at the display,.shaking

their heads confused...

The BEAT is SAVAGE.  Prince is in his

own world, living his own private hell.

Suddenly the MUSIC crescendos, then

winds down like a roller coaster

sweeping everyone along.  The BEAT

changes radically.  He turns his back to

the audience and plays ...

...and we suddenly recognize the MUSIC

as his Father's -- the song he played on

the piano the night before. But it's

Prince's now, stamped with his own

signature.  He's bent at the waist, his

back to the audience, alone with his

father's, and his, pain.

The CROWD fidgets...Billy Sparks fastens

his eyes on Prince angrily.

KIDS are hanging out in front of the

club.  The usual queue, however, is

noticeably absent.

The yellow Caddy sweeps up.  Jerome is

at the wheel, Morris and Vanity sit in

the back.  Morris is dressed elegantly,

resplendent in a 5O's-style suit.  She's

beautiful in a sleek black dress, with

long black gloves, and heels--

Just then Brenda and Susan come up to

the car excitedly.  Brenda is dressed in

a 40's-style dress, Susan wears a form-

fitting leopard one.  They both look

gorgeous--

Their excitement and nervousness is

endearing.  Vanity's heart goes out to

them.  She forces a smile, climbs out

unaided--

Prince is on-stage, deep into the

closing moments of "Computer Blue."  He

paces back and forth frantically, still

locked in his own private hell.  The

Crowd's attention has wandered, however,

and very few remain on the dance floor,

finding it too much trouble to keep up

with the changing shifts in the music.

Even his band members are edgy, casting

quick looks to each other, wishing to

get on with more compelling audience-

pleasing sounds.

BAR AREA

as Billy Sparks shakes hands with Morris

and Jerome and is introduced to Vanity

Six for the first time.  We can tell by

his reaction that he likes what he sees.

He kisses Brenda and Susan, saves a

special squeeze for Vanity herself.  He

escorts the whole group to a table

across the floor.  Vanity brings up the

rear, casts a quick look to Prince

onstage.

PRINCE

fastens on her and brings "Computer

Blue" to a rousing end.  The Crowd

applauds, but it's more out of respect

than eagerness.  He doesn't seem to

notice though, or care.  He confers

quickly with his group., then moves

center-stage.  The Band Members trade

frustrated looks with each other -- it's

obvious that they have some trouble with

the next song...

Prince presses his lips to the mike, and

the MUSIC starts.  He begins SINGING

"Darling Nicky"--

BILLY SPARKS

shoots a fierce look to Prince, helps

Morris, Jerome and the Girls to their

table.  Vanity is watching Prince, a

puzzled look on her face--

Jerome busts up--

But Billy agrees--

They all look toward the stage--

PRINCE

is fastened on Vanity and it's apparent

to all.  He launches into the next verse-

-

VANITY

flushes with embarrassment.  Billy and

Morris notice this and glare at Prince.

PRINCE

looks dead-center at them, and then to

Vanily--

VANITY

stands suddenly, fighting back tears.

She backs from the table quickly, knocks

the chair over.  Morris tries to help

her, but she sweeps past him, hurrying

for the exit.

as she comes down the stairs stumbling

slightly, tears streaming down her face.

Chick sees her, reached out to help--

But she pulls away, runs out the door,

cuts across the street.

PRINCE

brings the SONG to a blistering end.

The stage is plunged into darkness.  He

strips off his guitar, cuts from the

stage, ignoring the grave looks from his

Band Members.

as Prince twists aggressively past a

handful of FANS, rudely disregarding

their attention.  He Cuts into the

dressing room.

He's agitated, paces back and forth in a

frenzy.  Suddenly the DOOR flies open.

Billy Sparks enters angrily--

But Billy can't help laughing--

Prince shoots him a threatening look--

Prince turns away--

Billy turns to go--

He closes the door behind him.  Prince

stands dully a moment, then sits heavily

in a chair.  Exhaustion suddenly

overwhelms him.  He rests his head in

his hands, moments tick by...

He shakes himself awake -- Morris and

Jerome stand by the door--

He pulls an envelope from his pocket--

They leave.  Then Morris sticks his head

into the doorway--

COMMOTION.  CARS are THICK in front of

THE TASTE, a small NIGHTCLUB located in

the poorer part of the city.  Because of

its location, The Taste books different

dance bands four nights a week and then

hosts a Variety Night the remaining two.

Aspiring comedians, dancers and jugglers

flock to Variety Night, desirous of

trying their material in front of a live

audience -- and hoping to catch the

discering eye of a talent scout on the

prowl.

Billy Sparks pulls up to the curb, gets

out with a beautiful WOMAN and cuts

inside.

Jerome stands BACKSTAGE fidgeting

nervously, staring appreciatively at the

closed dressing room door.  Various

PEOPLE in COSTUMES pass by sporadically.

Suddenly a burst of APPLAUSE and

LAUGHTER wafts into the hallway.  Jerome

walks to the curtain and peers out--

JEROME'S POV--

Billy Sparks and his Girlfriend being

seated at a front table.  A COMEDIAN is

on stage juggling KNIVES and HATCHETS.

The CROWD is ROARING their approval.

(92) INT. BACKSTAGE -- THE TASTE -- NIGHT

Just then a CLOWN passes Jerome, stops,

and hands him a flower.  Jerome tries to

smile, but his nervousness is simply too

strong.  The Clown hands him another

flower, trying to elicit a favorable

response.  Jerome is patient, but

attempts to ignore the Clown in a polite

way, indicating he'd rather be alone.

The Clown persists, however, going

through a little routine, handing him

flower after flower...

Suddenly Jerome throws them into the

air, grabs the Clown by the throat and

flings him headlong down the hallway.

The Clown gives Jerome the finger and

walks off in a huff.

MORRIS

cuts from the dressing room, closes the

door behind him.  He joins Jerome at the

curtain, and they move down the back

stairway to the CLUB--

Respectful APPLAUSE--

He sits quickly, followed by Jerome --

they both put on sunglasses.

A HUSH descends over the CROWD.  The

CURTAIN rises slowly...and Brenda, Susan

and Vanity are frozen in a provocative,

vampy stance.  Their effect on the

audience is galvanizing --   the Crowd

bursts into APPLAUSE and WHISTLES--

Wearing sexy lingerie and moving

seductively to the beat, the Girls

launch into "Sex Shooter" with complete

abandon.  The MUSIC is slick and fierce,

the Girls sexy and sure.  Wearing black

bikini panties, black tails and boots,

Vanity dances center-stage and begins

SINGING.  She's mesmerizing, her look so

alluring, so profound that the audience

sits slack-jawed in amazement.  The

SPOTLIGHT is hers and she soaks it in,

radiating a sexiness that has the

audience at her feet.  The entire

concept -- dress, dance, music and

staging -- is overwhelming, with just

the right degree of playfulness to allow

the Crowd easy passage into the fantasy

world the Girls create.  Brenda and

Susan play off her wonderfully, sharing

secret looks with the Crowd, balancing

the wickedness of the act with an

innocence that is enticing.  They're

working strongly as a unit now, the

AUDIENCE roaring their approval...

MORRIS

and Jerome are beside themselves with

happiness.  The pull off their shades

immediately, sit back and glow in the

audience's response.

PRINCE

stands in the back, his eyes glued to

Vanity.  Her strength and sureness in

front of the Crowd is breathtaking.  The

audience loves her and he suddenly feels

very alone -- as if another wall has

gone up between them.  He looks away a

moment and spots...

...Morris looking at him with a self-

satisfied, triumphant grin on his face.

Prince looks away, moves out of his

eyesight.

"Sex Shooter" comes to an end.  The

stage is plunged into darkness.  The

CROWD goes WILD, leaps to their feet,

begging for more.  The Girls, slighly

over-whelmed by the response and

flushing deep red, hold one

another.tightly and take repeated bows.

PRINCE

watches the Girls bowing to thunderous

APPLAUSE.  Suddenly Vanity looks at him

and touches the earring she's wearing --

it's his Mother's.  His knees weaken

instantly, and he locks eyes with her.

The heat between them is unmistakable.

She smiles vividly, gives him an

endearing wave and steps back as the

curtain closes.

He's MOVING through the Crowd before he

knows it, trying to get to the backstage

door.  The Crowd is thick, his path

momentarily blocked.  He spots Billy

Sparks cutting across the floor and

congratulating Morris and Jerome.

Prince turns from them, tries once again

to make his way through the Crowd.

VANITY

and the Girls rush into the dressing

room and jump up and down with

excitement.  They are beside themselves

with happiness, kissing and hugging one

another avidly.  Suddenly Vanity pulls

away, indicates she will be back and

cuts out the room.

HALLWAY

as she runs down the hallway to the

backstage area, peers from behind the

curtain, scanning the club earnestly.

as Prince waits impatiently in the long

line.  Billy Sparks comes by, spots him

and stops--

He cuts outside, disappears into the

Crowd.  Prince stands there steaming,

the wind knocked out of him, his joy a

memory.  He turns back to the line, but

it has grown, the Crowd now jammed up

against the door.  Frustrated, he cuts

outside.

BACKSTAGE

as Vanity watches Prince leave.  A

profound sadness sweeps her face.

Suddenly Susan is by her Side, hugging

and kissing her happily.  Brenda runs

up, pouring champagne.  Morris, Jerome

and The Time are at the end of the

hallway and beckon her excitedly into

the room.  Vanity forces a smile, goes

down the hallway, casting another look

at the exit door.

(96) EXT. BACK ALLEY, THE TASTE -- NIGHT

Morris and Vanity stagger down the ALLEY

obviously very drunk.  Morris pulls from

a FLASK.  Vanity is still in her

lingerie, wears an open coat over it.

Her speech is slurred--

She kisses him spontaneously on the

cheek--

He fixes her with a sexy look, takes a

healthy look from his flask, then gives

it too her.  Vanity throws her head

back, drinks fully, the liquor coursing

over her cheeks.  He devours her with

his eyes, opens the door to the Caddy--

She stops as if remembering something--

He's trying to nudge her into the Caddy-

-

He staggers back from the car, undulates

his hips wantonly--

She busts up.  Just then a MOTORCYCLE

can be heard off screen.  They look

around drunkenly, trying to discern its

direction.  Suddenly Prince BLASTS

around the corner FULL OUT!  He streaks

by Morris and KICKS him flat on his ass

into the garbage--

Prince skids to a slick stop.  Vanity is

transfixed.  The entire episode  took

less than five seconds.  He twists the

throttle, BLASTS down upon her...

She breaks in a panic!  She runs

clumsily down another alley, her coat

flying.  He WHIPS after her like a

madman.  She flies around the corner --

a dead end!  He fishtails to a slick

stop--

There's no way out!  Suddenly she lets

out an excited YELP, jumps on.  He guns

the bike, BURSTS up the alley.  Morris

jumps into his path drunkenly, his arms

extended--

But Prince BLAZES down upon him, sending

him slipping and sliding to safety.  He

BLASTS around the bend--

(97) EXT. HIGHWAY  TO EMBANKMENT -- NIGHT

Prince and Vanity WHIPPING down the

highway.

They streak down the road, slow, then

move down a small embankment.  He stops

the bike and gets off.  She's in a foul

mood, staggers around dully, her head

pounding, her speech slurred--

He looks at her painfully, upset about

her drunken state--

She cackles, falls flat on her ass,

hoists herself up--

She pulls Morris' FLASK from her jacket

-- his eyes blacken--

She puts it to her lips--

She holds the flask to her lips

defiantly, then goes to drink.

He lashes out suddenly, SMASHES it from

her grip.  She SCREAMS wildly, SLAPS him

hard across the face.  He stands shocked

a moment, his rage surging within him,

smashing through every safety valve he's

acquired in his life.  He BACKHANDS her

savagely across the jaw.

She hits the ground like a rag doll.  He

looks at her curiously, bends over her -

- she sucker-punches him with everything

she's got!  He SCREAMS in rage and grabs

her hands as they flail about his face.

He squeezes her fingers back while the

tears stream down her cheeks and her

mouth forms a silent "ow"!  She bares

her teeth angrily and he sucks at her

mouth, biting and kissing her in a fever

pitch.

She kicks at him violently, hot tears

streaming down her cheeks.  He jams his

leg between hers, rubs it firmly against

her bottom.  She struggles helplessly

against him as he covers her breasts,

her stomach, her thighs with his lips.

Quick breaths escape from her -- her

breathing begins to race...

He snaps her panties in two, pulls them

from between her legs.  She spreads

herself as he releases his pants.  She

squeezes his buttocks, pulls him toward

her -- but Prince resists her coldly,

regards her with contempt.  Suddenly he

flips her onto her stomach, forces her

to stand painfully on her knees.  He

rubs his hand between her buttocks, then

thrusts into her painfully, driving

himself to the very depths of her...

...but she stifles a cry, arches her

back, and meets his thrusts fiercely,

moving quicker and quicker, banging her

buttocks against his thighs again and

again.  She's drawing from him now,

turning the humiliation around,

obtaining all that she needs and

desires.  He's powerless -- her thrusts

set the pace.  She rises, Prince still

inside her and tugs on him rapidly,

causing him to ejaculate suddenly,

drawing from him a sharp and sudden

cry...

She moves away, draws her coat tightly

about her, fixes him with a contemptuous

look--

She runs up the embankment, wipes away

her tears, faces him--

She pulls off his Mother's earring,

throws it at him.  Tears flowing, she

streaks into the HIGHWAY blindly,

directly into the path of a SPEEDING CAR-

-

THE DRIVER

spots her in his HEADLIGHTS, SLAMS on

his brakes!  He SKIDS wildly across the

road, comes to a SCREECHING, BURNING

stop inches from her thigh!

VANITY

shoots a look at Prince, her lips

trembling, her love for him, written

plainly on her face.  But his eyes flash

defiantly.  She bites her lip sadly,

then snaps a hot look at the Driver--

She cuts around the car, hops in.  The

Driver skids off into the night.  Prince

stands there trembling, watches as it

disappears into the distance.

DISSOLVE   TO:

Prince pulls up to the wooden gate, cuts

the motor, gets off.  He walk wearily

across the porch, moves to the front

door -- it's wide open.  He thinks

nothing of it, cuts into the house,

closes it behind him.

He stands by the door motionless, a

curious look on his face.  The STEREO is

on, the NEEDLE skipping monotonously

along the record.  His mouth opens into

a spasm--

Silence.  A sudden dread courses through

him, leaving a hollow in his stomach.

His feet are like lead.  He moves

heavily into the room--

Nothing.  Panic sets in.  He STREAKS

down the hallway, twists open the

bedroom door -- it's empty.  Blue NIGHT

LIGHT glows through the windows.

CURTAINS play delicately in the breeze.

He's thoughtful, walks back into the

living room...

...the COFFEE TABLE is SMASHED.  He

looks at it curiously, wondering

stupidly if it had always been like

that.  Then sudden bolt of fear makes

his head swim.  A lamp, a porcelain

dish, some knickknacks on the mantle --

all smashed.  He rushes into the

kitchen, looks around crazily--

Nothing but the decay of his scream.

The BASEMENT door is ajar.  He cuts to

it quickly, pulls it open, peers

frantically into the darkness below.  He

snaps ON the light...

SIRENS!  The SCENE is a riot of COLOR

and FRENZY.  A POLICE CAR, LIGHTS

FLASHING, skids into the drive.

NEIGHBORS jam the STREETS.  POLICE CARS

are parked all around.

CHAOS!  The BASEMENT is PACKED with

COPS.  Prince's father is strapped into

a gurney, staring dully at the ceiling.

PHOTOGRAPHERS snap pictures as

PARAMEDICS work feverishly over him.

I.V. UNITS are pushed into his veins.

An OXYGEN MASK is placed over his nose

and mouth.  Huge white bandages are

bunched up along the back of his head.

His Mother is kneeling by the gurney,

crying hysterically, grasping his hands

in a white panic.  TWO COPS support her.

Someone is SHOUTING instructions.

RADIOS crackle incessantly.  A MEDIC

cries--

And the gurney is hoisted up the stairs

quickly, the bulk of the crowd

following, his Mother supported as she

ascends the stairs.

Prince sits on a tattered sofa in the

corner, his head bowed.  Cops standing

and kneeling beside him.  Somebody

finished taking notes, closes his pad.

One Cop rests a hand on his shoulder,

talks to him in soft tones.  Prince

shakes his head slightly.  The Cop gives

the group a signal and everyone

disperses, moves up the stairs.  The Cop

looks at him sympathetically, then

closes the door behind him.

PRINCE

sits motionless a long time.  Moonlight

floods the basement with a foreboding

light.  A dog BARKS somewhere in the

distance.  He looks up suddenly, his

face agitated, his eyes red from tears.

PRINCE'S POV--

CHALK MARKS on the floor outlining the

body of his Father.  There's a GUN in

his Father's hand clearly marked.

A train WHISTLE in the distance.  He's

staring at the gun.  He shakes his head,

rubs a hand over his face vigorously and

looks up again...

...the GUN in his Father's hand.  He

can't get it out of his mind!  The

WHISTLE is CLOSER.

He lurches to his feet, paces back and

forth crazily.  His Father's head, the

gun...the gun...the...

The WHISTLE is LOUDER.

He throws himself into the chair, buries

his face deeply into his hands and

cries.  Huge racking sobs spasm through

his body.  His Father, his Mother, his

entire life, his music, his guitar...

He looks up suddenly -- the gun in his

Father's hand.

..and he stares at it.

The WHISTLE is LOUDER!

His heart is pounding in his ears.  He

squeezes them shut, looks up...

The gun.

He bolts to his feet, paces back and

forth in a panic!  The train is HOWLING!

A rope in the corner of the room, his

face, the gun...

He sits dully, gazes at the rope as if

in a trance.  The TRAIN is ROARING past

the house, it's HORN BLASTING.  The

rope, the gun, and his body dangling

from the rafters in the night breeze--

He lurches to his feet, cuts through the

basement like a madman.  He grabs a

stick and starts SLASHING things

crazily, moving through the room

swinging his stick wildly again and

again.

He's lost to himself now, deep in the

pit of an unknown terror, expurgating a

horror that has been festering in him

for years.  He flings his stick at the

wall, unends shelves and bureaus,

trampling old memories that have lain

dormant for years.

Drawer after drawer is flung against the

wall, their contents smashing and

scattering about.  He opens a large,

oaken chest and flips over.  Thick three

inch piles of yellowed paper fall out.

He snaps through the rubber bands

holding them together and flings the

paper at the wall again and again...

...he stops suddenly, shocked.  He SEES

musical notes written down on the paper.

his heart pounding in his chest, he

searches frantically through the rubble

scattered about him.  More and more

musical notes, sketched ideas, simple

melodies, entire songs and scores -- all

meticulously recorded on lined yellowed

paper, dated for the last 20 years, and

signed...by his Father.  He's shocked to

a standstill.  Then the full

significance of what's before him hits

him like a sledgehammer.  He collapses

in agony against the chest, tears

flowing down his cheeks.

Prince lying outstretched on the

basement floor, sleeping fitfully,

feverishly.  His body is lathered in

sweat, the droplets glisten in the pale

light.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Cool, gray dawn.  He's in a dead sleep

on the floor, his arms outstretched, his

legs twisted beneath him.  His Father's

outline seemingly rests by his side...

Just then the basement window begins to

glow with SUNLIGHT.  It inches slowly

across the floor, then sweeps him

majestically, bathing him in its warmth.

He wakes slowly, stretches his limbs

like an opening flower.  After a moment

he sits up, shades his eyes...

The basement is littered with debris.

The destruction is complete, but in the

midst of it lies his Father's music.

The yellow parchment is scattered about

glowing in the sunlight...

Something seems to flash across his

mind.  he stands, moves quickly down the

hallway to the antechamber...

Suddenly we HEAR a TAPE REWINDING.

After a moment...MUSIC and we

immediately recognize it as Lisa's and

Wendy's SONG.  It plays a moment, then

snaps off abruptly.  He stands locked in

thought, then sits behind the piano,

hunts for the first few notes of Lisa's

and Wendy's song...

DISSOLVE TO:

Prince's Father is lying on the bed,

sleeping peacefully.  A large bandage is

wrapped along the back of his head.  His

Mother sits by his side, her forehead

resting on the covers, her hands holding

his.  She's in deep sleep, and it's

obvious at once that she's been by his

side the entire time...

Prince steps from the shadows of the

room and gazes at them fighting back the

emotion that wells within him.  He leans

close and kisses them both gentlythen--

The CROWD goes WILD!  Morris, Jerome and

the Time return to the stage to a

frenzied throng.  The PLACE is PACKED,

the CROWD applauding like MAD!  LASER

LIGHTS strobe the house in a frenzy.

It's a glorious night, and Morris struts

back and forth imperialistically criss-

crossing the stage like a lion, urging

the audience on.  He grabs a mike--

The CROWD is SCREAMING -- Morris flashes

a wide, exaggerated grin--

And MUSIC.  The Time launches into "The

Bird" and Morris, laughing heartily,

does 'The Bird" (dance) with Jerome as

the audience ROARS their approval.

as Prince and his Band sit in grave

silence, the exuberant SOUNDS of the

CLUB filtering through the open door.

Jill is also in the room, sitting on a

table, holding the dog silently in her

lap.  She casts sidelong looks to

Prince, tears welling in her eyes.

The Band Members fidget nervously,

knowing full well that their jobs are on

the line, and feeling awful about the

personal tragedy that has befallen

Prince.  The entire situation is very

tense, and it's made worse every time

the crowd lets out a delighted ROAR of

approval.  But Prince sits placidly, his

face an enigma, his feelings a mystery.

And it couldn't be more of a contrast!

The place is a riot of color and raucous

carryings on.  "The Bird" is a smashing

success with everyone on the dance floor

trying gamely to get the steps right.

Morris and Jerome are flushed with

pride, surprising even themselves with

their impromptu adjustments to the act.

The MUSIC crescendos, then comes to a

rousing blistering end!

The stage is plunge into darkness.  the

CROWD goes BERSERK.  Billy Sparks shakes

his head happily--

Morris, Jerome and The Time cut briskly

past admiring FANS, laughing and

shouting crazily--

As Prince, Jill and the Band sit in dead

silence listening to The Time's bluster

off screen.  Suddenly The Time crosses

the doorway -- Morris does a double-

take, sticks his head into the room--

The Time busts up, drags Morris from the

room.  Prince's group is shocked, casts

furtive glances to him -- but he remains

serene, then--

Applause offscreen.  Prince stands

abruptly, straps on his guitar.  His

Band Members look at him closely, trying

to discern his feelings.  He gives them

a cursory glance, cuts out the door.

Prince hits the stage and the APPLAUSE

grows, but it' s nothing like the

exuberance that greeted Morris.  He

moves center-stage and plants himself

there, his eyes staring into the

audience.

BILLY SPARKS

leans against the bar, a smug look on

his face.

VANITY

walks slowly up the stairs, gazes at

Prince.

PRINCE

does not move.  The APPLAUSE trickles

away.  He continues to stare in the

audience making no attempt to direct his

Band, or start a tune.  A nervous

TWITTER ripples though the crowd.  Those

who know about the tragedy feel a

profound embarrassment for him -- but no

one turns away.  Then his voice comes

clear and mellifluous--

A MURMUR, cuts through the Crowd like a

riptide.  Prince snaps a look to Lisa

and Wendy and confirms that it is indeed

their song.  They can't believe it!

Tears spring to Wendy's eyes before she

knows it ...

Prince smiles at her, then gazes at his

entire Band.  Their eyes fasten on him

in an instant.  He counts softly and...

MUSIC.  The opening bars of "Purple

Rain."  He turns to to the audience and

SINGS....

It's a ballad, a poem really, a plea for

understanding, love, and survival.  It's

a testament, a pact if you will, between

himself and others...

The AUDIENCE is mesmerized, all EYES are

upon him -- but Prince doesn't notice.

Lips pressed against the mike, dark eyes

streaming, he's lost to himself now,

loosening all that's within him,

cleansing himself of his rage, hatred

and pain...

VANITY

is crying.  Every moment she has shared

with him is expressed in this song, and

the effect on her is unnerving.  Her

heart leaps to him in a way she never

thought possible.  But she lets it go

willingly, as the words draw her in,

seducing her somehow, making her

free...as if the music, his words, all

that he has experienced and  understood,

is purging what is confused and ugly

within herself, leaving her with an

understanding and joy that burns in her

womb like soft fire.  A smile springs to

her lips as tears continue to flow, and

she finds herself moving closer...

...as the Audience moves closer, drawn

somehow to the stage, to the person who

SINGS so truly, to the person who gives

of himself unselfishly to all that he

feels...

Prince begins a long sustained CRY that

cuts though the hearts of all present.

The MUSIC builds awsomely, and he

continues to sing out, emptying himself

of all the remaining pain lying within.

The MUSIC crescendos and comes to a

quiet end...

Stunned SILENCE.  A silence so profound

you could hear a pin drop.  Prince

sighs, assumes the worse, then cuts

across the stage purposefully.  Now some

CLAPPING.  And a WHISTLE from the back

and the SHOUTING.  And more WHISTLES and

some even SCREAMING.  And the WHISTLES

and the SHOUTS and the CLAPPING growing

and growing as....

Prince cuts from the stage in a frenzy,

rushes toward the rear exit.  The

APPLAUSE is building and building until

it's a THUNDER, an onrushing ROAR, an

avalanche of HYSTERIA that rocks the

club mightily...

PRINCE

is still running though, his face

streaming with tears, past the surprised

look of Jill, past the FANS, past

everyone -- stripping of his clothes

fiercely, flinging off his jacket, his

shirt, his scarf--

He SMASHES open the door, BURSTS

outside.  He sucks in the night air as

if he was drowning.  He wipes away his

tears, rushes to his bike, starts to

undo the chain...

...they're SHOUTING his NAME...

Not randomly, not haphazardly, but...in

unison.  And relentless, very demanding,

downright urgent, and...it's beautiful.

A wry smile crosses his lips.  He heads

back to the door.  Jill is there,

scared, her face a map of tears.  He

flashes her a smile--

She's thunderstruck, can barely squeak

it out--

And he whips into the hallway.  Her face

dissolves into a smile of pure joy.

MOVING now, FAST and FURIOUS.  The

HALLWAY is LINED with PEOPLE.  They

reach for him as he passes, touching

him, showering him with their love.

Someone hands him his shirt, another his

scarf -- it's so intense!

He's moving quickly now, his jacket up

ahead, closer...he stops suddenly,

stunned...

...Vanity is holding his jacket.  He's

struck speechless -- she hands it to him

smiling, tears streaming down her face--

His knees go weak, she kisses him

spontaneously, pushes him lovingly to

the stage.

THE CROWD IS ROARING!

He's half-running now like crazy -- his

Band is on-stage, peering anxiously into

the hallway.  They spot him and relief

sweeps their faces like a tidal wave.

He whips his jacket on, rushes up the

stairs...

STAGE

THUNDER!  Prince walks center-

stage...and bows.  The AUDIENCE goes

BERSERK!  He acknowledges Wendy and

Lisa, and then the entire Band.  The

CROWD is jumping out of their skin!  He

straps on his guitar, gives a deft

signal and--

MUSIC.  The Band launches into "I Would

Die For You."  Vanity squeezes her way

through the crowd and stands watching

Prince from the wings.  He presses his

lips to the mike and SINGS.

The MUSIC continues as we...

CUT TO:

Prince walks through the LIVING ROOM

slowly, gazes at the smashed table, the

broken lamp and dishes. Every item in

the room suddenly takes on a profound

significance.  His father's slippers

under the sofa, his mother's knickknacks

on the table, her pen and ink drawings

on the wall.  After a moment, he picks

up his father's slippers, studies them a

long time.

The DOOR opens -- a LIGHT snaps ON.  He

walks into the room, places his father's

slippers in the CLOSET.  His Mother's

dress is lying in a heap on the floor.

He picks it up, and puts it away.

as he descends the steps hesitantly.

The FLOOR is covered with rubble.  He

sits on the steps, stares at his

father's MUSIC on the floor.

"I Would Die For You" continues as we...

CUT TO:

Prince on-stage SINGING "I Would Die For

You."  The AUDIENCE is captivated,

locked into his grip again.  His eyes

seem to be focused on something far

away.  He closes them tightly, presses

his lips against the mike.

The MUSIC continues as we...

CUT TO:

He's in the final stages of cleaning the

basement floor.  The debris has been

swept up, shelves righted, smashed items

thrown away...

He stacks his Father's music neatly,

tears welling in his eyes.  He places it

in new boxes, stands wearily, a

fulfilled look on his face.  Suddenly he

stops -- stares at the awful chalk marks

on the floor:  his Father lying down,

the gun gripped in his hand...

"I Would Die For You" continues as we...

CUT TO:

Prince on-stage SINGING  "I Would Die

For You."  He's lost to himself now,

locked into a personal horror he alone

can see.  The CROWD is pressed against

the stage, mesmerized by his

performance.  Billy Sparks is also drawn

in, amazed at the power being generated

from the stage.  Prince sweeps the

audience with his eyes, then fastens on

Vanity earnestly, SINGS directly to her.

The MUSIC continues as we...

CUT TO:

He pulls a HOSE from behind the washer,

draws it on to the floor.  He hesitates

a moment, gazes one last time at his

Father's outline, tears welling in his

eyes.  He turns the water on, watches as

the dusty yellow chalk gives way

reluctantly, mixing with the water,

swirling down the drain.  Calmness

sweeps his face like a passing cloud.

Just then SUNLIGHT blazes in through the

casement windows.  Water droplets

glisten brilliantly in the morning

light.  He turns the water off, goes to

put the hose back -- stops suddenly,

surprised...

...his Mother's earring lies on the

floor.

He's entranced, picks it up, stares at

it a moment.  Everything he's been

through comes rushing at him like a loco

motive.  The confusion, the shouting and

violence, the darkness that eclipsed his

parents' life -- it's all there, lying

just below the surface, settled into his

heart.  But now there's a difference --

he knows it's there and has discovered

what could happen when it takes control

of your life.

So as he stands in the basement, on the

clean cellar floor, he realizes

that...he'll just take one thing at a

time, and do it right.  Better than

anybody else.  He smiles, realizes that

in the last few weeks, he's never felt

better than he feels right now.  He

turns quickly, flips the earring to the

stairwell...

...Vanity plucks it from the air.  Their

eyes lock and they share smiles of pure

joy.  He picks up his father's music,

and they both head up the stairs.

"I Would Die For You" continues as we--

CUT TO:

CELEBRATION!  Everyone is JUMPING up and

down.  Prince is radiant, strutting

across the stage, his hands upraised.

The CROWD goes WILD!  He flashes a wide

grin to Vanity, then twists, eyeballs

the CROWD wickedly, wonderfully.  It's

too much!

Everyone is joining in now.  Even Morris

and Jerome, standing in the wings, start

DANCING like crazy.  Then suddenly they

catch themselves, stop, act dignified.

But Vanity sees them and busts up.  They

catch her look, laugh heartily and join

in again.

The MUSIC segues into a fierce BEAT.

The CROWD lets out a ROAR!  Prince

strips off his guitar, streaks center-

stage.  The Band launches into "Baby,

I'm A Star."

...And the CROWD laughing, dancing,

shouting and loving.  The CLUB is ALIVE!

And the MUSIC continues...forever...
