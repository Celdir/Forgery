crossing.

breath, then..

She drives into the fast-moving river.

EXT. RIVER DEE - DAY

The Land Rover's engine roars. The jeep rocks alarmingly side

to side as it slowly crosses the river.

One big rock after another. The QUEEN skilfully negotiates

the challenge, and is beginning to enjoy the experience..

But ahead is one rock she hasn't seen..

`Crreeak', the Land Rover's undercarriage hits the rock. The

ugly sound of tearing metal.

wrong thing to do, slams her foot down on the accelerator.

The engine roars in protest, and..

`Snap'. An ominous mechanical sound.

The QUEEN's eyes widen. Knowing that sound was serious.

She tries to start the car again, but to no avail. No matter

what she does, the Land Rover is stuck..

The QUEEN looks into the glove box. Inside is a mobile

telephone.

INT. GHILLIES OFFICE - DAY

The HEAD GHILLIE listens, his expression changes in alarm,

then..

INT. LAND ROVER - SAME TIME

The Land Rover creaks as it rocks on the stone..

The QUEEN hangs up. Puts the phone away, then opens the Land

Rover's door.

The QUEEN gingerly climbs out of the Land Rover, and walks

across the stones to the river bank, getting her shoes wet.

Ah, that's good.

Privacy at last. The first moment of silence in what feels

like months. The QUEEN breathes deeply. It's all been a bit

much.

Suddenly, almost imperceptibly, we notice her shoulders are

Gradually, she composes herself.

That's better.

The QUEEN takes a deep breath. That's better.

sense that she is being watched. Strange..

The QUEEN turns to have a look, then almost drops the cup..

Standing in front of her, no more than twenty yards, is the

STAG.

The QUEEN freezes, hardly dare breathe. It is enormous. His

antlers are bigger and more dramatic than she could have

imagined.

His fur is thick. His blaze across his nose is distinctive.

He is vast, almost the size of a horse.

It is unprecedented - almost supernatural. No STAG ever

willingly comes this close to humans.

connection between them..

It's a magical moment. All around them the whistling of wind,

the sound of trees bending. Then, ever so faintly, in the

distance..

The hum of approaching engines. It's the GILLIES coming to

look for the QUEEN. Sensing this..

The STAG remains rooted to the spot..

The ENGINES get closer and closer. The STAG takes a last look

at the QUEEN, then briefly inclines his head, turns, and

walks off.

Several LAND ROVERS appear, driving across the river, and

GILLIES and EQUERRYS jump out, holding tow-ropes, waving in

greeting and calling out, concerned for the QUEEN's safety..

The QUEEN takes a last look in the direction of the STAG, to

make sure he has gone, and smiles to herself.

their grief..

PRINCE PHILIP appears in the doorway...

The QUEEN's eyes close. Pained..

ON SCREEN: television footage of FAMILIES sleeping in parks.

Kensington Palace is a sea of flowers and tributes. The MALL

is lined with singing, hugging, weeping MOURNERS of all ages

and nationalities, holding candles..

The QUEEN stares with total lack of comprehension at the VOX

POPS which the television interviewer is doing..

PHILIP indicates the television..

He shoots a quizzical look..

PHILIP turns to the QUEEN..

The QUEEN's eyes close. It's agony.

The QUEEN stares distractedly at the television..

PHILIP climbs into bed beside the QUEEN..

The QUEEN stares at the TV. Staring at a modern Britain, a

modern world she no longer understands.

EXT. HIGHLANDS - NIGHT

A bright, full moon. The unmistakable silhouette of THE STAG

walks slowly across the blue-white orb - until he reaches a

river..

There, he stops, and bellows imperiously into the night.

INT. DOWNING STREET - BEDROOM - DAY

The following morning.

6.30 am. TONY watches from his bed. The pastel-coloured set

of `GOOD MORNING TV'. The hosts, a MAN and WOMAN in their

forties, sit on a sofa. The MAN turns to the camera..

WE CUT TO: a smiling woman in her thirties, who sits at a

coffee table which is covered in newspapers..

INT. BALMORAL CASTLE - QUEEN'S BEDROOOM - DAY

The QUEEN sits in bed, reading the newspapers. Her expression

is ashen. She stares at the headlines.

A distant rumble of thunder.

INT. DOWNING STREET - TONY'S OFFICE - DAY

8.00 TONY BLAIR is with ALASTAIR CAMPBELL and a team of AIDES

are in a meeting room with the newspapers in front of them..

ALASTAIR raises his eyebrow.

ALASTAIR expects TONY to be pleased, but instead he appears

concerned..

CAMPBELL shows BLAIR the front page of `THE GUARDIAN' where

"BLAIR DEFENDS STOICAL ROYALS.." is a minor headline..

TONY's expression changes. Frustrated. He thinks, then..

TONY gets to his feet, and walks out. ALASTAIR watches

EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY (CLUNY)

The QUEEN walks out for her walk with her Corgis. She has her

head-scarf and old raincoat on. DOGS barking excitedly..

She is about to set off, when JANVRIN appears, breathlessly..

The QUEEN looks pained at the thought..

INT. BALMORAL - KITCHENS - DAY

Frantic KITCHEN STAFF disperse in all directions as the QUEEN

comes into the kitchen, DOGS barking..

COOKS and MAIDS doff their caps, bowing in respect, then run

into hiding, as the telephone extension rings..

The QUEEN picks it up..

The QUEEN gestures to her DOGS. They promptly fall silent.

INT. DOWNING STREET - SAME TIME

TONY sits in his chair..

INT. BALMORAL CASTLE - KITCHENS - SAME TIME

COOKS and FOOTMEN rush in a chair for the QUEEN, and bring a

The DOGS duly follow suit. And sit.

TONY takes a breath. Knows this won't be easy.

TONY braces himself. Knows the impact his words will have..

Distant rumbles of thunder...

A silence.

The QUEEN looks up..

Then drifts off, into her own thoughts

The QUEEN MOTHER's tirade continues, but the QUEEN is not

listening. She knows she has a decision to make.

EXT. BALMORAL GROUNDS - LATE AFTERNOON

The stalking Party is wrapping up after a day on the moors,

Philip listens

Thunderous, Philip hangs up.

PHILIP climbs angrily into the Land Rover, slamming the door.

People's eyes widen.

INT. QUEEN'S STUDY - BALMORAL - LATE AFTERNOON

The QUEEN's face in close-up. CHARLES peers round the door..

He stares. Then, after a beat...

Silence. CHARLES stares..

The QUEEN ignores him. CHARLES goes.

EXT. BALMORAL GATES - DUSK

of the WORLD's MEDIA whir and pop through the gates of

Balmoral Castle.

It's an eerie, venal image. An unmistakable echo of DIANA's

world, and her last moments in Paris.

The QUEEN, CHARLES, PHILIP, and the two PRINCES try not to

show their hostility, and gingerly inspect the flowers laid

at the gates of Balmoral..

The QUEEN's face is grim set. Lips pursed. Visibly uneasy

with the CAMERAS audibly whirring all around her.

CHARLES holds his son's hand, and tries to concentrate on the

flowers and wreathes and tributes.

Suddenly..

in shock, and flinches privately.

Clearly, his fears have not lessened. He's expecting the

bullet at any moment..

In the kitchen: CHERIE is feeding the kids supper at the

kitchen table. The cheery chaos of family life. Everyone

talking at once. Laughter. Teasing.

Through an open door, we can see TONY in the sitting-room

working. Shirt-sleeves, tie loosened..

INT. BLAIR FLAT - SITTING ROOM - SAME TIME

TONY sits with his feet up, doing his boxes, signing papers,

and half watching television at the same time.

ON SCREEN: the QUEEN and the Royals doing their photo-call.

The voice of the NEWS READER at Channel Four..

T

From the kitchen: CHERIE's voice..

TONY finishes signing the papers. Turns off the TV. Walks

into the kitchen. We hear CHERIE's voice as the door closes..

EXT. BALMORAL - DAY

The PIPER SERGEANT walks around the castle perimeter playing

the bag-pipes.

INT QUEENS BEDROOM - DAY

The Queen is being dressed in black by her DRESSERS. Her Face

apparently inscrutable. But the difficulty of the situation

is clear.

INT. BALMORAL CASTLE - BEDROOMS - VARIOUS - DAY

The QUEEN comes downstairs to the first landing where bags

are being brought out of the rooms by MAIDS and VALETS

The QUEEN heads downstairs.   PHILIP follows...

The QUEEN momentarily stiffens..

The blood has drained from her face..

EXT. BALMORAL - COURTYARD - DAY

The QUEEN, pulling an old Barbour over her black dress,

emerges into a courtyard where the royal cars are being

loaded with bags for the trip.

She climbs into a landrover, starts the engine.

SECURITY MEN stare quizzically at one another, then leap into

life and dash to their own cars to follow

They drive out of the Balmoral Estate.

INT. DOWNING STREET - BLAIR OFFICE - DAY

TONY sits at his desk working on his speech. A knock on the

door. ALASTAIR CAMPBELL enters..

ALASTAIR indicates the newspapers laid out on the table..

'The Times': `PALACE BENDS THE KNEE TO BLAIR"

'The Sun': "QUEEN CAVES IN ON PALACE FLAG".

`The Express': "DOWNING STREET STEPS IN TO SAVE QUEEN".

`The Mirror': "A QUIET WORD FROM TONY BLAIR AND THE NATION

GETS ITS WISH".

ALASTAIR goes. TONY watches. Losing patience.

EXT. NEIGHBOURING CASTLE - COURTYARD - DAY

The QUEEN's Land Rover, plus a protection vehicle, pulls up

in a courtyard at Braemar Castle.

The DRIVERS jump out. Go to open the doors for her..

Working STALKERS and GHILLIES stop in their tracks, and

double-take. Faces appear at windows. STABLE-HANDS, VISITORS

and ESTATE STAFF stop and stare..

We over hear whispers, `Bloody hell!' `It's her!'

Presently, the HEAD GHILLIE appears in a doorway,

deferentially straightening his hair, and clothes. He walks

towards the QUEEN.

H

EXT. NEIGHBOURING ESTATE - DAY

The QUEEN and HEAD GILLIE walk towards a circular cooling

room. The HEAD GILLIE opens the door..

INT. NEIGHBOURING ESTATE - REFRIGERATED ROOM - DAY

A large cooling room, where the shot animals are washed,

disembowelled and cut up.

Hanging in the centre of the room, his innards removed, blood

draining onto the floor, is the STAG. A GAMEKEEPER, in

overalls, is working on the carcass, when the door opens, and

the QUEEN walks in.

The QUEEN gasps in shock. Notices the GAMEKEEPER was about to

begin the process of severing the STAG's head. The HEAD

GILLIE, mistaking her reaction for admiration, smiles..

The QUEEN stretches her hand out, almost touches the wound..

Unseen by others, the QUEEN's knuckles whiten..

The QUEEN goes. Dignified on the outside, but dying a

thousand deaths underneath.

INT. AEROPLANE - ROYAL FLIGHT - DAY

The QUEEN's face. She staring out of the window, dying a

thousand deaths inside, on her way to RAF NORTHOLT in London.

She is aboard the private jet belonging to the Queen's

Flight, sitting opposite her is the QUEEN MOTHER

with their humiliating headlines.

A shadow passes across her. The sound of a clearing throat.

The QUEEN looks up. It's ROBIN JANVRIN. She snaps out of it.

She puts on her glasses. Composure returns. Professional

again.

JANVRIN opens his mouth, wants to say something to comfort

her..but realises it would be inappropriate.

EXT. MALL - DAY - ARCHIVE

The CAR carrying the QUEEN and PRINCE PHILIP sweeps into the

MALL.

ALASTAIR sits at his desk. A TV plays the footage of the

QUEEN's car driving through the MALL..

A SECRETARY walks in..

She passes it over to ALASTAIR..

ALASTAIR starts reading it..

INT. CAR - SAME TIME - ARCHIVE / RECONSTITUTED ARCHIVE

The QUEEN and PHILIP stare out of the car. For the first

time, they get an idea of the actual size and scale of the

CROWDS..

The QUEEN stares in fear and disbelief at the people lining

the MALL. In places, the CROWDS are standing twenty deep.

Are they people she understands? Camera flashlights pop.

ALASTAIR makes a change to the Queen's speech. We CLOSE on

the text as he writes, inserting...

In the background, on TV: we see the QUEEN's car pulls up.

The doors open, the QUEEN gets out..

Unaware her words are being edited by her Government.

EXT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY - LIVE

INT. DOWNING STREET - MONITORING ROOM - DAY

TONY and several AIDES are watching the televisions.

ON SCREEN: the QUEEN and PHILIP are looking at bouquets laid

at the gates of the palace, reading messages and

inscriptions..

Candles are burning. Incense sticks. There are pictures of

DIANA, and mini-shrines. Poems have been written.

ALASTAIR enters..

ALISTAIR holds it between finger and thumb..

ALASTAIR passes it to TONY..

ALASTAIR turns, walks towards the door..

TONY spins round, eyes flashing in anger..

EXT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY

The QUEEN continues to read the hand-written messages for

DIANA, "We love you." "Rest with the angels, Diana". "You

touched us with your love."

for them." "They have your blood on their hands."

Behind her, a small GIRL approaches, holding a bouquet of

flowers. She stops, in front of the QUEEN..

The QUEEN is thrown. Suddenly looks utterly lost. Vulnerable,

almost childlike. Her eyes are puffy and swollen, as though

she is fighting tears..

C

INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - CHINESE ROOM - DAY

A television CREW is rigging lights in the Chinese Room in

Buckingham Palace. JANVRIN enters and crosses the room.

CAMERAS are being fixed to tripods..

The QUEEN sits in a corner going through her speech.

The QUEEN makes a note on the text..

The QUEEN turns as SOUND RECORDERS fix a clip-mike to her

dress.

The QUEEN gets up.

The QUEEN is led over to where the DIRECTOR has placed a

chair and table in front of the cameras and lights..

The QUEEN sits at her desk. Final touches from hair and make-

up. The MALL is clearly visible. The QUEEN holds the speech

in front of her..

We close on the QUEEN's face, and..

WATCHING FROM THE WINGS:

jaw muscles in irritation.

notices this, then..

CHERIE turns, and stares..

TONY bristles with irritation..

INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - CHINESE ROOM - SAME TIME

The QUEEN draws to a close. Her face is inscrutable. The

DIRECTOR prepares his CREW to wind up..

CLOSE-UP OF THE QUEEN:

The QUEEN holds her expression for the camera. Then..

The QUEEN's face relaxes. As does everyone in the room. A

huge, collective breathing out.

But the QUEEN doesn't acknowledge him. She removes her clip-

mike, and hands it to the DIRECTOR..

..then walks over to a waiting PRINCE PHILIP, who

protectively extends an arm. The QUEEN and PRINCE PHILIP

leave the room. People are left staring awkwardly at one

another..

CAPTION: `TWO MONTHS LATER'

The face of TONY BLAIR stares back from a bathroom mirror.

CHERIE is proudly tying his tie. Checking his appearance.

We're in the family apartment above 11, Downing Street.

CHERIE puts the finishing touches to his appearance..

We notice her appearance has become even more stylish. Gone

is her spiky hair. And the rough edges. Every inch the First

Lady. They've both come a long way in a short time.

CHERIE straightens his tie..

TONY's motorcade sweeps into Buckingham Palace. Doors are

opened by his PROTECTION OFFICERS.

JANVRIN allows himself a private smile..

INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - CORRIDOR - EVENING

TONY BLAIR and the EQUERRY walk along the corridor, and reach

the door.

INT. AUDIENCE ROOM - EVENING

TONY and the EQUERRY enter. Both bow from the neck..

TONY walks forward and meets the QUEEN, who, like JANVRIN,

barely smiles, doesn't make eye contact, shakes his hand, and

indicates a seat..

The QUEEN's face. Stiffens.

Silence.

Silence. TONY takes a deep breath, then..

The QUEEN looks up..

The QUEEN looks up. Thrown by his compliment..

She wants to say `Me', but instead says..

The QUEEN looks at TONY, raises an eyebrow..

The QUEEN opens her handbag, and takes out her reading

glasses..            E

The QUEEN looks out of the window. Notices how the sun is

setting..

TONY and the QUEEN get to their feet.

FOOTMEN open the door as TONY and the QUEEN go out of the

Audience Room, and into..

INT. CORRIDOR - BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY

BLAIR and the QUEEN turns a corner, and emerge into a

corridor from the audience room...

Unexpectedly, she stops. And suddenly we realize she's been

holding something back..

They begin walking again..

The QUEEN stops..

The QUEEN drifts off..

Then pulls herself back..

INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - GRAND STAIRCASE - DAY

The corridor outside. As the QUEEN passes JANVRIN, he

surreptitiously looks at his watch, and raises his eyebrow.

The QUEEN smiles..

INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - GARDENS - DAY

FOOTMEN open double-doors which lead out into the gardens.

The QUEEN and the PRIME MINISTER walk out..

TONY clears his throat, then..

Our CAMERA slowly pulls back over the gardens, until the

QUEEN and TONY are two dots in the distance...

Time has moved on. Sand has covered the footprints.

The momentary hiccup that was `Diana' already long

forgotten..
