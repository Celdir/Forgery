2 INT: DOCTORS SURGERY - DAY                                2

We reveal the genetic Doctor, sitting at his desk, smoking a

cigarette. The surgery and the clothes suggest the year, yet

there are small things that are different, not what you'd

expect to be around at this time. Standing next to him in the

dusty haze of the room is a younger doctor; an apprentice who

looks attentive.

The apprentice nods and then looks up. There is someone else

in the room. A woman - who we now see is pregnant. There is

something about her that suggests more a prisoner or

psychiatric patient than a normal pregnant mother.

We see the woman; she's like a hollow person, hardly aware of

where she is. The Doctor shuffles papers. Finds what he wants.

The woman now looks up. And tentatively speaks.

The woman drops her eyes. We see the Apprentice Doctor,

almost pitying the poor woman.

We are closer on the woman now. Tears begin to glisten in her

eyes as we drift closer to her.

We track in closer, closer, to the woman, then continue,

right into her eye, through the fluid, to see the room

reflected upside down at the back of the retina. This

dissolves to an upside view of...

Silus again; concentrating even more. Now the distant sound

of trickling water.

Cut to

A drain pipe, leaking.

Cut to

Silus once more. This time we can hear "plop, plop, plop."

Cut to

A pool of water. Then "plop" as a drop hits it. The drop is

not water. The drop is a red liquid, thick, now dispersing in

the water. And another drop, "plop." High speed CRANE UP from

this pool, up up the side of a building to end on a FACE in

the shadows. We can see reflective, gleaming eyes. And a

mouth, with blood dripping from it.

Cut to

Silus again. His eyes flicking open; we see the footpath

reflected in those perfect light gray eyes.

Music - brooding, ancient - begins to hum as Silus slowly

rises, as if his limbs have the power to make him float, so

perfect and powerful are they. A small smile has appeared on

his lips; it is the smile of a man who knows that something

very dark, something very dangerous, is close by.

Slowly his hand slips into his jacket. He holds it there,

watching, surveying the street immediately ahead of him for

the slightest movement. He sees it. On the wall of an old

Georgian Mansion across the road, a shape on the side of the

wall, almost imperceptible, hidden in the shadows and

brickwork. A CREATURE on the side of the wall.

Silus begins to move forward now, everything in perfect

shining silver slow motion. As he moves forward he pulls a

gun from his jacket - it is silver, organic and glass, art

nouveaux styling - and points it ahead of him as he glides

forward.

The creature on the wall senses the movement coming towards

it, moves a little and then, like a spider, scrambles along

the side of the wall, heading away from us.

Silus fires. A bullet of silver explodes from the gun, seems

almost to hang in the air for a moment, reflecting the moon

above, before hurtling at high speed towards its target.

The shell explodes the wall next to the creature, who stops

suddenly in the light so that we can see it.

Lilly lets her eyes drift down, all the way down to the chair

legs, which rock unevenly on the floor. Lilly is staring at

the scratched, worn floor boards which MOVE.

Cut to

Frank, prizing back the floor boards. Jones restrains the

Slum Landlord. Lilly watches. Frank pulls the floor boards

away easily. We see that hidden in the floor cavity are

packets of something. Frank pulls them out.

Rips one of the plastic bags open. In it are packets with the

words "Jamestown Borough - Civilian Influenza Vaccination."

Frank holds it up for Lilly to see.

The Slum Landlord is now looking three ways at once.

Lilly slowly begins to approach the Slum Landlord.

The Slum Landlord just stares at her.

Lilly smiles grimly.

Lilly moves forward. She can now see the woman more clearly.

The woman is obviously dead; her pale white skin like wet

shining alabaster in the dark alley. Flashes from

photographic machines light the scene, almost blinding Lilly

and briefly revealing the true horror of the scene.

Lilly kneels and carefully begins to examine the body.

Another man now walks up and kneels next to Lilly; young,

good looking, obviously takes pride in himself.

Dominic bends down and moves the dead woman's head,

displaying the side of her neck. A bite has torn the skin on

the side of her neck. The wound extends down, the carotid

artery sliced in two.

Lilly nods, then looks down at the woman's dead, cockeyed

stare. Lilly closes the woman's eyes.

She is passed a bloody ID. Lilly stares at it.

Jones now arrives.

No one answers. Jones shrugs.

Lilly sees the red shirted street urchin in the distance

being talked to by two uniformed policemen.

Lilly nods.

All the police officers stare at her; they know what she

means alright.

Jones shrugs and nods. Lilly gets up and moves towards the

street kid who is being talked to by two burly, grumpy

policemen. The boy is shaking.

Lilly looks at the boy. So young.

The kid doesn't answer and gets a whack around the ears from

one of the policemen.

Lilly stares at the kid, as if the way he looks has keyed a

memory in her. She squats and looks him straight in the eye.

The kid looks nervous. Lilly moves some of the bedraggled

hair out of the kid's eyes.

The kid smiles. Lilly focuses on him now.

The kid stares at her; she's a magician and he's a believer.

Lilly smiles.

Lilly stops smiling. For the first time she is still.

Silus nods.

Lilly becomes more interested at this; at the bald honesty of

the statement.

Lilly stares at him. There is already something between them

even though they stand on opposite sides of a huge gulf. She

nods, accepting his point.

31 INT: POLICE STATION, BRIEFING ROOM - LATER               31

Everyone nods and shuts up as Lilly stands in front of the

men.

There are guffaws from most of the policemen.

Lilly is angry. There is silence in the room. Lilly seems

more angry than she should be.

Jones shrugs.

No one moves. They all stare at Lilly.

She motions to Silus, who rises, watching the glares from the

cops who eye him like a suspect.

An old slide projector heats up as the main lights are turned

off. The projector sprays an image up on the wall. The face

of a killer, before he became one, the serene gaze of a

Brother.

3 photos come up. The victims.

A Map.

Silus stares directly at Jones now. Their eyes lock. Silus

continues, perfectly calm.

Silus moves to the desk next to him. He passes something to

another cop who now sits at the desk. We see Lilly now. The

look on her face tells us that she knows what is coming and

she's not looking forward to it.

We see what Silus gave the cop. An audio tape. The cop places

the tape in a tape deck. He then switches it on. He then

turns the volume knob on an amplifier which now directs

static hiss to two big speakers.

We see the faces of the cops, all listening in the dim light

coming from the slide projector.

Above the level of the hissing tape there is another noise.

It is a wet sound. Like a cat would make if it were lapping

up milk. An another sound. Like an animal, moaning with

pleasure.

We see the cops; some of them are beginning to twig. And

there is another noise. It is a man; moaning.

We see Jones and Dominic. Their glares say it all. And then

another voice.

Then we hear a punch and then noises which can only be

described as sounding like a dog killing something.

Jones springs out of his seat.

Jones stands there enraged. Dominic pulls him down back into

his chair. All the cops are appalled by what they have heard.

And then a voice.

We can hear Edgar moving around.

We see Silus, listening as intently as everyone else.

More moving around, then the sound on the tape cuts out. We

are left with only tape hiss. Everyone stares at Silus.

The cops all stare at Silus' emotionless response.

Frank nods.

Jones then stares down at Lilly pressing one hand against the

wound. Close on Lilly, going into shock. She's shivering.

At that moment SILUS appears at the door.

Silus stares at Lilly, bleeding to death in Jones' arms.

Silus immediately bends to her. With his free hand Jones

pulls out a vicious knife which he points at Silus.

But Silus ignores the knife and moves closer to Lilly.

Jones wavers.

Jones backs the knife away. Silus whips   his hand to the blade

of the knife, slashing his wrist, blood   immediately issuing

from the wound. He presses his bleeding   wrist to Lilly's

mouth. At first resistant, Lilly begins   to suck at the wrist.

Jones is appalled.

Silus then leans close to Lilly and whispers in her ear. All

the other noises in the soundtrack drop out.

Slowly she does. Silus removes his wrist from Lilly's mouth.

She is silent, comatose.

A medical team now scramble through the door, pushing past

Silus and the bloody Jones and begin to work on Lilly. For a

moment Silus and Jones stare at each other. Then Silus turns

to the ventilation shaft in the corner. He closes his eyes.

Listens.

He's getting away!!

Quiet.

The camera zooms right into the interior of the gun to see

the projectile entering the gun's chamber and the hammer

igniting it.

The projectile explodes out the end of the gun.

High Angle of the projectile flying towards its target, the

ceiling lights above streaking past on its reflective

surface, cruel mechanical claws suddenly slide out from the

side of the capsule.

Then Edgar, camera tracking back at high speed.

Slow move in on Silus' cool gray eyes.

Then whack! The projectile stabs into Edgar's back, the claws

springing forward to hook onto Edgar's flesh, we see the

fluid within the transparent projectile flow into Edgar, see

Edgar's eyes widen, see his POV of the approaching window

then...

Crash. Edgar's head implants itself in the wall below the

window, the dust and debris from the wall board drifting over

Edgar's numb stare.

In the background Silus stands. Motionless.

We see Jones walking forward, gun still pointing, heading

towards Edgar. Silus turns and steps in front of him.

Jones stares at Silus and contemplates firing.

Silus doesn't move. He stares calmly at Jones.

Jones points the gun in Silus' face.

Beat.

Silus regards her and she him. She reaches out and touches

his hand, almost retracts at the smooth texture of the skin.

She turns over his hand to reveal the wrist; the scars are

almost gone from where Silus cut himself.

She releases his hand.

Edgar leans closer to Silus.

They are staring at each other very intently now. Edgar

smiles gently.

Edgar moves.

For perhaps the first time, we see a real hint of anger on

Silus' face.

Lilly turns to Jones.

Steph now emerges from the kitchen, dressed in a t-shirt and

shorts and carrying some food. Jones looks at her coldly.

Lilly and Steph smile at the inference Jones is beginning to

draw.

Meanwhile Lilly shushes them and turns back to the murky gray

images emitting from the television.

Jones and Lilly watch as Silus is seen on the television in

an interview. Steph stares at the screen with awe, she

involuntarily kisses the symbol that hangs from a chain

around her neck; it resembles a Brother's ring.

Jones sneers under his breath.

We move over their shoulders to track closer to the black and

white TV screen.

As she is saying this we are now close on the TV's speaker.

We then begin tracking out. We reveal the speaker is not part

of the TV, but the speaker in Edgar's cell. Edgar, smiling

coldly as he listens. As he listens he is gently gliding his

finger nails against a sharp edge of the chair; sharpening

them.

Close on Edgar.

Edgar listens, smiles.

Freddy puts the gun down. The Prostitute on the ground now

scrambles to her feet and heads towards Steph.

She gives Freddy the finger then heads off.

Freddy gets down.

Low Angle on Steph approaching. Behind her a FIGURE is

descending the wall behind him.

Steph is over Freddy now. He's staring up at her. He can see

that a shape has appeared behind Steph. EDGAR, his eyes

gleaming. Steph pulls out some handcuffs.

But before Steph can move forward, Edgar has her gun hand in

a vice-like grip. She cries out in pain as her wrist

disintegrates. As a reflex she stamps on Edgar's foot and

kicks him in the groin with her other.

He does not flinch. He smashes Steph into a down pipe on the

wall of the alley so that wet grit is ground into her face.

We then see Edgar's face at her shoulder.

Edgar pulls back the jacket at Steph's neck to find no scars.

He pulls Steph's face towards him brutally, staring at her

profile.

He then smashes her head against the pipe so that she falls

unconscious to the ground.

Edgar's stare makes Freddy shut up and avert his eyes. Edgar

then turns on the tube on his arm so that blood drips into

the unconscious Steph's mouth; making her gag.

Freddy's licking his lips.

Edgar studies Freddy, then raises his arm. Freddy just

stares. We see the tube on Edgar's arm that connects to his

veins. And in a moment Freddy has latched onto it and is

sucking like some kind of human leech.

For a moment Edgar strokes Freddy's hair, then rips the tube

away.

Freddy moves forward, but is pushed back by Edgar.

Close on Edgar, his repellent features under the hood. He

looks up. Far above, through the falling rain, past the high-

rise slum around them; we see the moon hanging like a pearly

crescent in the sky. The moon is slowly obscured by clouds.

Cut to

80 EXT: JAMESTOWN CLUBLAND, STREET - NIGHT                     80

Making her way through the crowded street. The rain has given

way to a fine mist.

Then, as Lilly moves forward she senses something; that

feeling again, that she is being watched. She stands for a

moment as people push past, looks up at the gothic Victorian

buildings that loom out of the drifting mist. But there is

nothing.

Lilly begins to make her way through the drifting mist,

casting glances at the odd passerby.

Then, ahead of her, there is one pedestrian in particular,

taller than the rest, wearing a great hooded jacket, who

stands out. He is immediately suspicious to Lilly. He is

slowly moving through the crowd towards her. From under the

hooded jacket we see the glint of the approaching figure's

eyes; an intense stare hidden in the shadows. The man now

puts his hand in his pocket as if he's reaching for something.

Lilly now slowly slips her hand into her jacket, her gun a

cold hard presence in her hand. She stares ahead at the

approaching figure, who has now stopped, after bumping into

a pedestrian. Lilly continues forward, closer, closer. From

under the hooded jacket the glistening eyes of the man ahead

catches hers for a moment. The man now begins to approach

her, his hand pulling something from his jacket, going for

something. A gun.

Lilly immediately pulls her gun. The mist beads on the

shining barrel of her gun. The man is raising his hand

towards her.

The man now lurches forward, his hand rising towards Lilly,

her finger begins to caress the trigger of her gun, as the

man looms closer. And then he is gone.

Cut to

The man slamming against the wet wall of a building, grasping

at the hands that now threaten to throttle him.

And we see Silus, his hands on the man's throat, and for only

the second time, we see anger in Silus' eyes.

People in the street scatter as more Brothers emerge with

guns pointed. And Lilly, shaking, pointing her gun at the man

Silus is holding. On the ground, next to the man, she sees

what he had in his hand. A pamphlet. Asking people to come to

church service; a picture of a Brother priest serenely

beaming out from it.

Meanwhile the man that Silus has is gagging on the ground,

Silus' hand still on his throat. He's begging.

Lilly grabs Silus' shoulder.

She shows Silus the pamphlet.

The man now pulls back his hood. He is black, his large,

watery eyes stare up in awe at Silus. He grabs Silus' hand

which now relaxes and draws Silus' ring to his lips, kissing

it, in tears.

We see Silus' dark stare.

A beat.

Then Silus reaches out and places his hand on the man's head.

Silus rises, the Parishioner just lays there in awe. Silus now

turns to Lilly who is on his shoulder. And now Lilly realizes

for the first time that it is Silus.

We then hear a police siren and a car pulls up through the

rain. The door opens and Jones emerges, taking in both Lilly

and Silus. A grim smile of realization comes to Jones' face.

He pulls something from his jacket.

We see them fall, Silus hitting a railing which sends him

spinning out of control, whilst Edgar manages to clasp onto

it.

Cut to

Silus' POV, tumbling wildly out of control, heading for the

ground, finally coming to a jarring stop, the view of the

alleyway upside down.

We now reveal Silus, only just conscious, caught in wire

netting, hanging upside down in the alleyway.

And there, landing, is Edgar, poised, watching. Edgar slowly

approaches so that he is near. He bends down to Silus.

Edgar's nose is bleeding. He dabs some on his fingers, then

raises his hand to Silus.

He brings the dripping blood closer to Silus, closer...

Then an explosion; the sound of bullets whistling through the

air. Then Edgar is gone.

Cut to

Lilly and Jones entering the alleyway to find Silus still

hanging from the railing.

Lilly then moves into the adjacent alleyway to search for

Edgar.

She turns and gives him a final quick look.

Cut to

Lilly moving through a slick wet alleyway; water plops and

dribbles from leaking pipes. She swings her gun towards

movement; water crashing out of a pipe. Lilly's shaking,

terrified, but she keeps on going. And then another sound and

she swings her gun to find Edgar, standing in the shadows,

waiting.

Edgar purposely raises his hand so that she fires; the bullet

going through the flesh of Edgar's arm; his arm now smoking.

Edgar can only smile.

Then he moves, she fires, but he's too fast, spinning,

diving, in an instant he has the gun, twisting it and Lilly's

arm behind her back. She fires, once, twice, the bullets and

smoke rising up from Edgar's side. He twists harder, the gun

then falling to the ground. Edgar is now behind her. He moves

his face close to hers.

Lilly tries to twist out of his grasp.

Edgar's face twists into a smile.

Edgar grabs her by the throat, for a moment anger boils out

of Edgar, but he restrains himself.

Then Edgar's face changes; he stares at her with pity, for a

moment we see a hint of the noble creature he used to be.

Lilly senses an opening.

Edgar places his head in his hands, he seems to be weeping.

When he looks back up at her, he is terrifying to behold.

111 INT: BROTHERHOOD BUILDING, AUGUSTUS' OFFICE - CONTINUING   111

Augustus turns to Silus. Augustus moves closer to him, stares

into Silus' strange, pale eyes.

Augustus moves off to his desk. Silus is shocked.

Augustus looks up at Silus; this is perhaps the first time

Silus has refused anything that Augustus has decreed.

113 INT: JONES APARTMENT - NIGHT                                113

Silus doesn't answer now. Jones moves forward.

Jones prods Silus' shoulder with the gun.

Jones prods again and finds Silus' elegant steel fingers

around his wrist. The two men face off.

Jones tries to wrench his wrist free, but Silus holds it

tight. Jones swings his free arm and smashes Silus on the

side of the face.

For a moment Silus doesn't move, then his hand is around

Jones' throat. Squeezing. Squeezing. His other hand wrenching

the gun from Jones' hand. There is silence in the room, apart

from Jones' choking gags. Then Silus pushes Jones back so

that he flies into a chair. Jones stares up at Silus now,

fear in his eyes. Silus watches him. Then a sound attracts

his attention.

Cut to

Water hisses from Jones' coffee machine in the kitchen.

Then the figure moves into the tunnel, shuffling, the legs

not completely following the brains instructions, but doing

enough to propel the person forward, then a stumble. And in

a shaft of light Lilly can see a hand slapping at the wet

wall. But it is less a hand than a claw. And the face that

follows the hand; the red, reflective eyes of one of the half

mad, the infected. The thing catches sight of Lilly, then

propels itself towards her.

We see it's POV, approaching faster, faster.

And Lilly reaching out with her foot, to the door, struggling

to hook it with her foot, trying to close it, almost catching

the door handle, but her foot is so slippery and the thing is

almost on her. Then she stretches out with her foot, just

catching the door and slams it in the face of the thing that

is about to attack her.

The thing on the other side of the door is now screaming

wildly and the door handle is jerking down as the creature

tries to activate it and Lilly has her feet on it, trying

desperately to keep the door shut, but her feet keep

slipping. And then she realizes that the pipe from which she

hangs is beginning to wobble - water is now coursing from the

hole in the wall, beginning to flow faster and faster. Her

feet slip more and more on the door.

Lilly tries to keep the door closed, but her feet are too

slippery and the thing is pushing through the door. In the

dark space only its eyes and slavering mouth are clear, hands

grasping for Lilly legs, scratching at them, Lilly twisting,

the creature's nails searching for purchase on her legs.

Lilly hauls herself up, wrapping her legs around the pipe

she's attached to. The thing below her is groaning

incoherently, reaching up, its hands grabbing at her, Lilly

pulling herself just out of reach, then seeing the eyes below

her, wanting her. Lilly tries to pull herself higher. And

then she feels it. The pipe she's attached to is shifting,

where it joins the wall. Water is now flooding from it, the

pipe jerks down, some of the old wall giving way.

The creature's fingers are now able to grasp Lilly's t-shirt,

drag at it, pull at her, screaming, the pipe grinding, water

flowing and then the whole thing comes down, the pipe

bursting out of the wall.

Lilly and the pipe falls, right on top of the creature.

For a moment neither of them move, then the creature is

grabbing at Lilly's hair, pulling her head back. In a flash

Lilly pulls the pipe to which she is attached right into the

face of the creature. This gives her time to stagger upright.

She's still chained around the pipe; she can see the end of

the pipe near the door.

124A INT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, HIDEOUT, STEAMROOM - CONTINUING        124A

Stunned Edgar releases his grip, stumbles back, Silus rising

now, he has him. Again, Silus slams Edgar's head into another

pipe. And now Silus has Edgar's throat in his fist and the

look on Silus' face tells Edgar he will not escape.

We see Edgar, beginning to lose consciousness now, dying.

Steam now rises all around them from broken pipes. Then

behind Silus, Edgar can make something out. An old, corroded

tank, steaming, with the words sterilizer on it. There are a

series of long shafts connected to the sterilizer via a tube

and held in position by clamps; they look like they're for

sterilizing bottles.

With a last effort Edgar propels Silus backwards onto one of

the shafts, making Silus grimace and clutch his back where

he's been pierced, then slide to the ground. The piercing has

operated some lever so that steam now also drifts from the

wound on Silus' back.

Cut to

Silus looking up, clutching his back with the pain of it.

And now Edgar above him. He removes one of the sterilizer

shafts from the bracket that holds it. He clutches a lever on

the side which makes viciously hot steam pulse from the end

of the shaft. Edgar moves slowly towards Silus.

We see Silus, unable to rise, crawling back, until bang, he's

stopped by more pipes behind him. Nowhere to go.

And Edgar ready to pounce. He does, driving the shaft towards

Silus' head. Silus manages to raise one hand to Edgar's wrist

to stop the shaft from piercing his skull. Now the shaft is

right in Silus' face, the lightly steaming hole staring back

at Silus. Edgar's finger moves to the lever on the side of

the shaft, ready to get some steam going.

Cut to

Edgar's finger moving over the steaming lever. The steaming

end of the shaft right in Silus' face.

Then Edgar's face as he watches his brothers face for the

last time.

The blasting sound of steam and a steaming blast from the

shaft drifts into our frame.

Cut to Silus. His face is not scolded.

We see Silus, closer, watching.

Cut to

Lilly, pausing, moving to the window of her apartment,

staring out into the night, almost directly toward Silus. She

raises her hand, as if in a gesture of goodbye and then she

leaves.

Cut to

Silus, close, nodding.
