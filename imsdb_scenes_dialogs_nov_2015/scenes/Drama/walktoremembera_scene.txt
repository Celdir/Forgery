BLACK

A young man's V.O.:

The voice is gentle. Slightly Southern in inflection.   A

young doctor's soothing manner.

FADE IN:

EXT. COASTAL NORTH CAROLINA (DECEMBER) (PRESENT)

A vast view of the coastline in winter -- beaches, rivers,

sea marshes, inlets -- ebbing and flowing.

The CAMERA FINDS a small coastal town, edged by a harbor

on which fishermen toil.

EXT. BEAUFORT, NORTH CAROLINA - MORNING (DECEMBER)

The CAMERA, MOVING inland, CROSSES OVER modest houses

decked with plastic rooftop Santas...

And MOVES UPHILL TO...

EXT. MAIN STREET

Where fake snow is sprayed on store windows. The CAMERA

CONTINUES TO the far side of Main Street -- with its

stately homes with big lawns, flower beds, and tasteful

Christmas garlands.

EXT. FOUR-WAY STOP

From each corner, four churches face each other. The

Fellowship Hall Christian Church, the Church of the

Forgiven People, the Church of Sunday Atonement, and All

Saints Church.

EXT. LANDON'S TRUCK - TRAVELING

The CAMERA FINDS and FOLLOWS a newish sport utility

vehicle with MD plates as it passes a rummage sale and a

softball game.

Dr. LANDON CARTER, 33, drives the truck.

INT. CAR - TRAVELING

Landon looks urban, prosperous, well-groomed -- but

retains his boyish whimsy and sense of irony. A cell

phone and overnight bag on the seat next to him.

Landon reaches out to adjust his side mirror, revealing a

simple gold wedding band on his left hand.

EXT. STREET - TRAVELING

Landon's truck turns the corner and slows in front of the

huge Southern Baptist church.

Landon's truck turns into a driveway just past the church

and heads for a cluster of buildings. Behind the

buildings, a cemetery.

EXT. CLUSTER OF BUILDINGS - CONTINUOUS ACTION

The truck pulls up in front of the old parsonage -- it's a

different color than he remembers.

Landon hesitates a moment, then climbs out of his truck.

EXT. OLD PARSONAGE - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Landon heads up the walk and onto the front porch.

Presses the DOORBELL. It RINGS inside. Landon is edgy,

unsettled.

A nurse opens the door.

EXT. BEAUFORT HIGH GYM - NIGHT (NOVEMBER, 1985)

ROCK MUSIC drifts out open doors -- barely recognizable as

"Born in the U.S.A." Students hang. Brains, preps,

richies, heavy metals, jocks, punk rockers, goths, geeks.

Mixing without mixing. Most are red-eyed, woozy, wasted.

A couple of boys break dance to a BOOM BOX.

Missing are the criminals...

A shiny T-top CAMARO ROARS up. Stops, TIRES SQUEALING.

VAN HALEN BLASTING. LANDON, 18, at the wheel. He is

impulsive, sexy-troubled, with the nothing-to-lose courage

to act on destructive whims. He is envied, copied,

feared.

INT. CAMARO

EMPTIES roll and CLINK on the floor. A tiny plastic

skeleton dances as it hangs from the rearview mirror.

Landon stamps a joint into the ashtray.

CONTINUED:

ERIC's skinny, high-energy.          A leg always jiggling.

BELINDA is Landon's girlfriend. Richie princess, a bad-

girl pretender. Big shoulder pads. Jellie bracelet.

Swatch watch.

They laugh.       Clay's by the dumpster.

EXT. DUMPSTER

CLAY, obese, wearing a too-small student monitor vest, is

dumping garbage from a trash can. A loud HONK. Clay

turns to see the Camaro, then turns back to the school,

coast clear. He quickly heaves in the empty trash can as

the Camaro pulls up.

Eric pushes a door open.       Empties fall from the back seat.

Clay climbs in.

PRINCIPAL ED KELLY, middle-aged, pockmarked skin, Casio

calculator watch, exits the gym.

INT. CAMARO

Landon's looking at Kelly in the rearview mirror.

CONTINUED:

Landon inches the car forward, teasing Clay, teasing

Kelly.

Sniggering laughter.

Landon presses the gas.    The CAR ROARS away.

Clay smiles, good-natured.    He often misses social cues.

EXT. CAMARO - TRAVELING

Landon drops Clay's student monitor vest out onto the

road. Another car runs it over.

EXT. ROAD

Mr. Kelly walks over, picks up the vest. Shakes it.

Frustrated. Eyes the empty beer bottles by the dumpster.

EXT. OUTSIDE CEMETERY GATE - LITTLE LATER

Camaro is parked on the dirt access road, headlights

shining through the locked rear gate. JOHN COUGAR

MELLENCAMP's "Small Town" playing.

INT. CAMARO

Landon, Clay, and Belinda sit drinking, smoking weed.

Under the MUSIC, a CB RADIO scanner CHATS quietly.

CONTINUED:

EXT. CAMARO

Eric finishes taking a leak.

Eric climbs back in the car.

INT. CAMARO

Landon, Belinda, Clay, Eric.

Landon's looking out at the night.

CONTINUED:

Everyone looks up.     Derisive laughter.

THEIR POV

A pale, contemplative GIRL, 17, is jumping down off the

gate, caught in the headlights. Wearing clothes she

probably made herself; long hair hiding her face. She

lives in her mind, not her body.

BACK TO SCENE

EXT. CAMARO

JAMIE (GIRL), hearing the laughter, gathers herself and

approaches Landon's window, her SNEAKERS CRUNCHING in the

GRAVEL. She crosses her pilly brown sweater across her

chest.

CONTINUED:

And he does.    Darkness.

She backs away from the car, grateful.        From the car:

INT. CAMARO

Landon switches on the dome lights for Belinda.

But Landon's looking at Jamie.     Almost counting the

seconds...

HIS POV

Jamie scaling the fence, practiced at it.

BACK TO SCENE

Landon quickly flicks the high beams.     Belinda, Eric, and

Clay snicker and snort as they see --

EXT. CEMETERY GATE

Jamie, startled, paused at the top. But instead of

looking bullied, her face shows determination, humor even.

A moment later, she jumps down on the far side.

Disappears.

INT. CAMARO

Belinda, Eric, Clay are still laughing.       Landon's smiling.

CONTINUED:

Laughter.

He clinks Eric's raised beer. More laughter. But

Landon's face clouds slightly -- maybe this isn't where

he'd really like to be.

Laughter.    Landon kisses her.      With tongue.

A blinding white light dances through the car and settles

on Landon and Belinda's faces.

He scrambles out of the car.

EXT. CAMARO

Landon looks up at the fence.

LANDON'S POV

Jamie sitting atop, holding a large mirror, reflecting the

headlights back into the car.

BACK TO SCENE

They stare at each other.   His annoyance turns to mild

respect.

The CB RADIO comes to life inside the car.     A GARBLED

TRANSMISSION.

INT. CAMARO

Landon leaps in.    Pops out the Van Halen.

Landon pops in a WHAM! tape.     AMPS it UP.   "Freedom."

Nobody answers.

Landon turns the car around.

EXT. ACCESS ROAD

The Camaro fishtails away. TIRES CRUNCHING, red

taillights bouncing on the rough road. The car turns left

onto the paved road and speeds out of sight.

INT. CAMARO

Landon drives recklessly.   Rushing.   He makes a SCREECHING

turn.

LANDON'S POV - STREET AHEAD

Two fire trucks rumbling by houses, SIRENS WAILING.

EXT. CAMARO

Turns right, following the fire trucks.

INT. CAMARO

Landon smiles at Belinda. She smiles back. Fun. Landon

takes a slug of beer. Turns his eyes back to the road.

LANDON'S POV - FIRE TRUCKS

make another turn. Then a flash of light, movement.         A

figure on the road.

EXT. ROAD

An old man walking his little dog.     Crossing the street.

INT. CAMARO - LANDON

turns the wheel hard.      Jams his foot on the brake.

EXT. ROAD

The Camaro swerves.     TIRES SQUEALING.   A LOUD, HEART-

SEARING THUMP.

The old man -- sideswiped, drops to the asphalt.

The CAMARO SLAMS into a light pole.     CRUNCHING METAL.

TINKLING GLASS.

INT. CAMARO

Quiet.   Landon, Eric and Clay are banged up.

Belinda's head leans on the dash. Her shoulders shake.

Landon, bleeding on the forehead, reaches over. Scared.

CONTINUED:

She lifts her head.     Looks at him.   She's laughing.   He

kicks his door out.

EXT. STREET

The Camaro crumpled into the light pole. Headlights

askew. Clay and Eric and Belinda getting out, dazed.

Landon runs to the old man. Kneels. Shakes him.       No

response. The man's TERRIER BARKS at Landon.

LANDON'S FACE

Frightened, anguished.     The real Landon showing for an

instant.

Police SIRENS WAIL in the b.g., growing LOUDER.

EXT. OLD CHEVETTE - HALF HOUR LATER

A battered Chevette steers through a working-class

neighborhood.

INT. CHEVETTE

Landon's mother, CYNTHIA, 35, drives. She's weary with

sun-worn skin, but still attractive. She wears a skimpy

black-and-white cocktail waitress uniform under her coat.

He smiles his biggest most reassuring smile.

EXT. BEAUFORT HIGH - MONDAY (7:59 AM)

By daylight, a modern brick and glass structure.

INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - 8:05 AM

Mr. Kelly gestures for Landon to sit.   Landon doesn't.

His forehead still shows a bruise.

On his desk, he places the empty bottles that rolled out

of the Camaro.

Kelly holds up the police test finding.

Landon scowls, knows he's defeated.

CONTINUED:

EXT. SCHOOL ENTRANCE - MINUTES LATER

Landon busts out, arms high, fists tight, like a righteous

political prisoner. Freedom. He struts through the

courtyard. Not a care in the world.

EXT. CARTER DRIVEWAY - HOUR LATER

Landon watches a tow truck lower the crumpled Camaro. A

neighbor kid, JOSH, 12, watches from across the street, on

his way to school.

EXT. CAMARO - MINUTES LATER

Landon pokes and prods his car -- the engine, underneath,

the body, the paint. A discouraging mess.

INT. CARTER HOUSE - HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER

Landon knocks on Cynthia's bedroom door.

INT. CYNTHIA'S BEDROOM

Dark. She wears a black eye-shield.      Her waitress uniform

hangs over a chair.

EXT. GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

Landon lifts the garage DOOR.

LANDON'S POV - INSIDE GARAGE

A murky place.   Filled with old tools and junk and a grim

old bike.

EXT. MINI-MALL - AUTO PARTS SHOP - LITTLE LATER

Landon comes out the glass door, his arms loaded, sees his

bike. No way to carry. He looks around. The bus stop.

A bus approaching.

EXT. UNDER CAMARO - LATER

BANGING, RATCHETING, CLINKING. Landon's working hard.    A

BOOM BOX playing SIMPLE MINDS' "Alive and Kicking."

LANDON'S POV - HIS MOTHER'S LEGS

and worn terry slippers appear.

He pauses, annoyed, then rolls himself out.

EXT. CARTER DRIVEWAY

The mangled front bumper's on the ground. Cynthia stands

there in her bathrobe. Upset. Landon's almost too much.

Landon ignores her.    Slides back under his car.

EXT. UNDER CAMARO

Landon can't believe this.

EXT. DRIVEWAY

Landon slides back out.

Cynthia sets her jaw.   He knows that look.

INT. RESTAURANT - KITCHEN - LUNCH HOUR

Landon is sweating, scouring pots. A crooked cap on his

head, an assistant manager name tag on his shirt. He's

making some headway; only two more to wash.

MARVIN, the owner, walks over. Beer belly, greasy hair.

Dumps another pile of dirty pots and pans in Landon's

sink. Landon glimpses his future.

INT. PRINCIPAL KELLY'S OUTER OFFICE - EARLY AFTERNOON

Landon paces, jumpy. Kelly's secretary, MISS TARBOX,

quietly locks her purse in her bottom drawer.

The door to Kelly's office opens. Jamie Sullivan exits

with her father, the tall stern REVEREND HEGBERT SULLIVAN.

Jamie eyes Landon as she passes by.

Nobody laughs or even smiles.

INT. PRINCIPAL KELLY'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Mr. Kelly makes a note in Jamie's file.

They both know Kelly has the upper hand.   Kelly leans back

in his chair, relishing it.

Kelly studies Landon, the boy who can't get out of his own

way.

Landon shrugs, clueless.

CONTINUED:

His tone quiets Landon.

Landon's not happy, but he'll work with this.     As he heads

for the door:

CLOSE ON BROOM

pushing gum wrappers under a radiator.

INT. SCIENCE CLASSROOM - AFTER SCHOOL

Landon sweeps at the floor during the Star Club open

house. A dozen nerds, including Jamie Sullivan (wearing

her brown sweater), stand at astronomy exhibits. Students

wander in, listen, look.

To her small audience, she holds up a contraption made

from a wire coat hanger.

No one does.

But Jamie hears.   She regards him a moment, then keeps

going.

Clay and Eric enter, checking on Landon, glancing at

Jamie.

CONTINUED:

Landon laughs loudly.    Members of the club look at him.

Jamie smiles.    She can laugh at herself.     And she finds

Landon funny.

INT. CARTER KITCHEN - EVENING

Landon washes up while his mother sets the table.      The

MICROWAVE HUMS in the b.g.

He picks up the envelope with wet hands. Without looking

inside, rips it in half. Cynthia smiles, quietly happy.

INT. SCHOOL BUS - TRAVELING - SATURDAY MORNING

Enthusiastic preppies, richies, other do-gooders, singing

"Karma Chameleon." Jamie sits in an aisle seat, reading,

not singing. She turns around to look at Landon.    He

rides in the back row, staring out the window, wearing a

Sony Walkman, glum.

HIS POV

To Z.Z. TOP'S "Sleeping Bag." Out the window -- Jefferson

High School coming into view. Bars on every window,

chain-link fence around the parameter, no grass.

INT. JEFFERSON HIGH - LIBRARY - LITTLE LATER

A big room with tables and chairs but few books. Pairs of

heads are bent over textbooks and notebooks. Landon sits

with LUIS, a freshman boy of mixed ethnicity. A geometry

text between them.

Luis is lost, intimidated.

Luis shrugs. Luis looks down at the book as if for the

answer, then at Landon, hopeless. He gets up and walks

off. Landon looks up in disbelief and catches Jamie

studying him. She's at a nearby table with her student,

ISABEL.

INT. SCHOOL BUS - NOON

The DOOR SWISHES SHUT behind Landon as he hops aboard.

He's late and heads for the rear bench seat.

LANDON'S POV

Jamie sitting there.   And no vacant seats save next to

her.

BACK TO SCENE

The bus begins to roll.   Landon lurches forward.

TRAVELING - LATER

The bus is moving through Beaufort. Landon sits next to

Jamie. Putting a new tape into his Sony Walkman. His

body turned away. She's reading her book.

Landon scowls.   What-who is she talking about?

CONTINUED:

That old man.

If he heard her, he makes no sign.     She goes back to her

book. A long beat, then:

Not really.

CONTINUED:

She reads again. The bus pulls to a stop in front of

Beaufort High. Belinda, wearing a neck brace, is waiting,

leaning on her Cabriolet. Jamie watches Landon exit the

bus.

JAMIE'S POV - OUT THE WINDOW

Landon greeting Belinda, kissing her.

INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - TUESDAY EVENING

Landon opens a side door, peers in at the Drama Club.

LANDON'S POV

A big space with a stage. MS. GARBER stands before six

geeky boys, and a dozen fat girls and Jamie.

BACK TO SCENE

Landon reacts -- this girl actually chooses to be in these

places? Ms. Garber looks up from her papers.

He slides in a row behind the others. Leans forward and

pokes a boy, EDDIE JONES. Eddie's pimply and talks with

his eyes squinched up.

Eddie hands him a photocopied script, The Rainmaker.

ON STAGE - MINUTES LATER

Jamie and Landon sit in folding chairs, reading from

scripts. Landon's wooden, showing how lame this is.

CONTINUED:

Jamie smiles.    Garber taps her script -- continue.

Ms. Garber eyes Landon, motions for him to keep going.

As Lizzie, Jamie looks into his eyes.

Hoots and laughter.    Jamie looks away, humiliated.

Groans among the boys.    Jamie is horrified.    So is Landon.

CONTINUED:

Kelly's been standing in the wings.

Everyone stares at Landon.     He's trapped.

EXT. AUDITORIUM - LATER THAT EVENING

Raining. Landon exits behind all the others. Stands

under an overhang, lights a cigarette, angry, waiting for

a ride. Jamie approaches, something on her mind.

Landon laughs. Refusing to take her seriously. Behind

him, the lights go out as the school closes for the night.

Pause.

CONTINUED:

He exhales, eyeing her, daring her.

She walks off toward her father's old Pontiac.     The last

car in the parking lot.

Fire trucks rush by on the street below. Landon's ears

twitch. He looks about. No one, no ride. He sees the

Pontiac backing out of a parking spot.

EXT. PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

Landon bangs on the side of her car as she drives past.

INT. PONTIAC

Jamie turns to look at him.

JAMIE'S POV

Landon, wet, desperate, his eyes pleading.

INT. OLD PONTIAC - TRAVELING - MOMENTS LATER

Jamie's at the wheel.

CONTINUED:

He points the way, to the taillights of the fire trucks.

The wet road glistens.

He fishes in his pocket for a tape. Pulls one out.      He's

searching the dash -- no cassette player.

She jerks the car across the center lane. Driving on the

wrong side of the road. He grips the dash.

LANDON'S POV - OUT WINDSHIELD

Headlights looming, a car coming.      Closer and closer.

BACK TO SCENE

She swings the Pontiac back to the right lane. Smiling.

A car zips by in the other direction, HORN BLARING.

Landon drops his attitude, his act.   He toys with the

glove compartment knob.

Pause.   He acts like he doesn't hear, but he's interested.

EXT. ACROSS STREET FROM FIRE - LITTLE LATER

Landon and Jamie walk around the fire, watching the fire

and the firemen. Landon is just tolerating her.

If she's offended, she keeps it to herself.

CONTINUED:

They both smile.

He smirks.

He lights a cigarette.       She reaches for it.

She grins and takes a drag.      They share the cigarette.

She eyes him, not certain she's willing to risk sharing

her dreams with him.

CONTINUED:

He likes the frivolity of these.

She looks away, embarrassed.

He's certain she's joking.

He looks at her like she's crazy to worry about this.

CLOSE ON PARSONAGE FRONT DOOR

swinging open. Reverend Sullivan looming tall.   Ichabod

Crane in a collar.

EXT. PARSONAGE PORCH - WIDER - NEXT EVENING

Landon gives a cheery little wave. He's very sweaty.   His

bike teeters on its kickstand in the b.g.

Landon offers his hand. The Reverend shakes reluctantly,

eyeing him closely: Landon's Army boots, torn jeans,

dirty t-shirt, aloof manner.

Jamie slides out the door. She looks good in jeans and a

white t-shirt. Almost normal. In the b.g., Landon's BIKE

CRASHES over. He bounds down the porch steps.

The Reverend looks at Jamie, concerned. Landon tries the

kickstand, then leans the bike against a carefully trimmed

bush. Not the best place.

But she's already gone.   The Reverend gestures toward the

open front door.

INT. SULLIVAN LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Dark and prim with stiff furniture left to fade. Landon

pokes around, then stares at a photo of little girl Jamie

with her parents. He looks up, aware that the Reverend is

studying him closely.

CONTINUED:

The Reverend waits, letting Landon suffer the silence.

His eyes lock with Landon's. His message clear. A NOISE

and Jamie is there, carrying glasses of lemonade, all

cheerful.

INT. PARSONAGE - KITCHEN - MINUTES LATER

Jamie washes the lemonade glasses, happy.      Her father

comes in.

CONTINUED:

Pause.

INT. JAMIE'S BEDROOM - ONE AM

Jamie hops out of bed, pulls on jeans and a sweatshirt.

INT. HALLWAY

Jamie peers into her father's room. He's sleeping.     She

tiptoes to the staircase and down. Sneaking out.

EXT. REAR ACCESS ROAD TO CEMETERY - TEN MINUTES LATER

Landon is waiting when Jamie appears. He has scripts in

his back pocket. They smile at each other, laugh.

CONTINUED:

She grins, skeptical.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Jamie leads Landon toward the cemetery rear gate.

Pause.   Landon's caught off-guard by her frankness.

EXT. CEMETERY - REAR GATE - NIGHT

Jamie quickly scales the fence.       Landon's right after her.

INT. CEMETERY

Jamie drops down.     Takes a flashlight from her bag.

CONTINUED:

He drops down, not sure what she means.      She's already

walking away. He follows.

She looks at Landon, feeling his sorrow, then unlocks a

storage shed. Opens the door. Enters. Returns a moment

later carrying several pieces of an odd-looking home-made

cylindrical device.

SAME SCENE - MINUTES LATER

The ten-inch Dobsonian telescope is pointed at the sky.

The eye-piece is at the end of the long scope; the scope

rests on a plywood base. Landon looks through the eye-

piece.

POV (THROUGH TELESCOPE) - CLOSE ON GOLDEN PLANET

a beautiful view of a golden planet with a broad, flat

ring system.

WIDEN.

CONTINUED:

She looks at him.    He smiles, embarrassed.

She smiles, disagreeing, then looks through the telescope

and changes its view.

Pause.   He doesn't know what to say.

Their eyes meet.     She looks away.    Changes the subject.

CONTINUED:

She likes that he knows a little about astronomy. They

each lean back on a tombstone and stare at the stars.

Pause.

Landon could joke or he could reveal something.

CONTINUED:

Pause.

He sits up and pulls Rainmaker scripts from his back

pocket. He holds one out to her. A moment passes. She

takes it.

INT. PARSONAGE - HALLWAY - LATER THAT NIGHT

Jamie sneaks from the stairs to her room. Shuts the door.

A light glows under the door, then goes out.

INT. REVEREND SULLIVAN'S BEDROOM

He opens his eyes, listens, then turns over and goes back

to sleep. Not suspecting. Not yet.

INT. LANDON'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

Dreary. Landon lies in bed, flipping the TV CHANNELS,

past "Square Pegs," "Miami Vice," MTV, to a British nature

documentary. After a moment, he searches for a pen and

paper. Titles it "Life List." Pause. He doesn't know

what to write.

EXT. BEAUFORT HIGH PARKING LOT - MORNING (BEFORE SCHOOL)

Landon, Clay, Eric, Belinda. Eric's pickup is parked by

Belinda's Cabriolet. RADIOS ON, BLASTING the same

station, same song: JOHN FOGERTY's "Rock and Roll Girls."

They look.    Jamie's watching them.   They laugh.

CONTINUED:

They laugh more and she's there.

He doesn't respond.      She shifts from foot to foot.

Confused.

His friends snicker and guffaw.      She looks at them, then

back to Landon.

She gives him a funny look and walks away.      A better

person than he and he knows it.

They laugh. Landon the loudest.      It feels good, but he

also feels a little... bad.

INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

Cleaned up. Swept out. The Camaro is still a dented

mess. But Landon drops its hood down, wipes his hands,

and climbs behind the wheel. The ENGINE STARTS.

INT. JAMIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

No posters of pop stars. Books by Houston Smith, Thomas

Merton, Alan Watts, Carlos Castaneda. Jamie studies,

listening to JONI MITCHELL's "I Wish I Had a River." The

DOORBELL RINGS.

INT. FRONT HALL - MOMENTS LATER

Jamie opens the front door. Landon. A stern voice from

the living room. Reverend Sullivan's.

Jamie shuts the door.

EXT. SULLIVAN FRONT PORCH

Landon can't believe this.   He presses the BELL again.

She's standing in the front yard.

WIDER

He steps down off the porch.

CONTINUED:

Pause.   He thinks she might be going for this.

She walks up the porch steps, goes in the front door, and

opens it. Before she goes in:

INT. SULLIVAN FRONT HALL - MOMENTS LATER

Jamie leans against the closed door, trembling, almost

crying. In the living room, her father looks up from his

reading, sees Jamie, then parts the curtains, looks out,

glowers.

REVEREND SULLIVAN'S POV - OUT WINDOW

Landon standing in the front yard, confused that Jamie

would reject his generous offer of friendship.

EXT. FRONT YARD

Landon walks to his car, then yells back at the parsonage.

The front door opens, startling Landon. It's the

Reverend. Red-faced with fury. Landon glares back, but

then climbs in his car and drives off. Ashamed.

INT. PARSONAGE - LIVING ROOM - MINUTES LATER

Jamie sits on the sofa.   Her father doesn't look up from

his reading.

Tears well and Jamie's face cracks with guilt and

heartbreak. She leaves before her father can see her

distress.

INT. LANDON'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

Landon lies in bed watching another British nature

DOCUMENTARY, this one on astronomy. He reaches for his

school yearbook. Flips the pages until he finds Jamie's

photo.

CLOSE ON JAMIE'S PHOTO

She's smiling and looks almost cute. Listed under her

photo are clubs: Red Cross, Stars and Planets, Drama.

Ambition: To Witness a Miracle.

INT. JEFFERSON HIGH - LIBRARY - SATURDAY MORNING

Landon and Luis sit over the geometry text. Landon has

just asked a question and Luis is shrugging sadly.

Landon's eyes wander out the window.

LANDON'S POV - BASKETBALL HOOP

BACK TO SCENE

EXT. JEFFERSON HIGH - BASKETBALL BLACKTOP - MINUTES LATER

Landon and Luis face each other across the half-court.

Landon's got a ball and is further from the basket.

Landon and Luis both step forward.

Luis steps outward, directly opposite Landon.

Landon tosses him the ball. They play. Jamie glances

over from a picnic table where she works with her student,

Isabel. Landon looks at her, she looks away, he looks

back. Thoughtful. Watching her. But not staring.

INT. BOOK STORE - EVENING

Landon studies the books in the spiritual/religion shelf.

CONTINUED:

He picks out a book, then sits in a corner.

But before he opens the text, he looks around him,

suddenly taking in all the books, all the learning, all

the knowledge that could be his.

EXT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - WEEK LATER

On the marquee: The Rainmaker. Under this, "All

Invited." Under this, a full parking lot.

INT. AUDITORIUM

A full house. Parents, teachers, students, churchgoers,

booster club and rotary members.

ON STAGE

The set is a wealthy Midwestern ranch house of the 1950s.

Eddie and two other BOYS play other characters. The

play's underway...

STAGE LEFT

Landon watches, dressed as Bill Starbuck in a nicely

fitted suit. Waiting for his entrance.

LANDON'S POV - STAGE

BACK TO SCENE

From stage right, Jamie makes her entrance as Lizzie.   A

collective gasp from the audience.

LANDON'S POV

Jamie, wearing makeup, a dress that clings, her hair

pulled back.

BACK TO SCENE

Landon can't take his eyes off her.

AUDIENCE

Reverend Sullivan -- enraptured. Principal Kelly --

hopeful. Cynthia Carter -- uncertain. Clay, Eric, and

Belinda -- rocking in their seats, snickering.

BACK OF AUDITORIUM

A well-dressed man, DR. JONATHAN CARTER, Landon's father,

slips in and takes a seat a couple of rows behind Cynthia.

BACK OF AUDITORIUM - LATER

Dr. Carter hangs on every word. Others sit on the edge of

their seats. Even Clay, Eric, and Belinda. Belinda leans

forward to take a photo.

BELINDA'S POV THROUGH CAMERA LENS

As she ZOOMS -- Landon and Jamie on stage, growing larger.

ON STAGE

Landon, Jamie, and the three boys.

ON STAGE - LANDON

is Starbuck.

Jamie looks. She sees something in his eyes she hasn't

seen in them before. Love.

LANDON'S POV

Jamie, her face lovely. Her eyes shining, radiating,

looking directly at him.

BACK TO SCENE

Landon is dumbstruck.

Landon changes the line and nails it. Surprising himself.

Surprising her. They both know it's sincere. A moment

passes. Her stomach churns with anticipation.

He leans in. She closes her eyes. They kiss. Gently,

genuinely. When Jamie opens her eyes, they are filled

with tears.

CONTINUED:

The curtain crashes down.    End of act two.

CLAPPING from the other side of the curtain. Landon tries

to meet Jamie's gaze. But she's looking at the floor.

AUDIENCE

Principal Kelly, pleased. Cynthia Carter, proud. Clay

and Eric, surprised. Reverend Sullivan, frowning,

concerned. Belinda's face is cold, hard.

EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - HOUR LATER

Landon runs out, looking for his friends.      Mr. Kelly

shakes his hand, then deals with parents.

LANDON'S POV

Belinda getting into her car.

WIDER

Belinda stops.

She waits.    Landon struggles with what to say.

Landon watches her START her CAR, back from a parking

space --

Landon turns.    His father is standing on the curb.

CONTINUED:

Landon moves toward his Camaro.

Landon opens his car door and gets in.         Not forgiving.

INT. BEAUFORT HIGH - CORRIDOR - NEXT MORNING

Landon waits by Jamie's locker.       The BELL RINGS.   No

Jamie.

INT. CAFETERIA - NOON

Landon walks along the lunch line, looking.        No Jamie.

INT. LIBRARY - LATER

Many many books. Landon cruises the stacks. No Jamie.

Belinda, sitting at a table with a girlfriend, sees Landon

and turns away. He doesn't pursue it.

EXT. CARTER DRIVEWAY - DUSK

Eric and Clay watch Landon hammer out dents in the Camaro.

They're smoking, sharing some beers. Josh, the neighbor

kid, stands across the street, wanting to be invited over.

CONTINUED:

Eric and Clay exchange a look -- is Landon defending her?

Eric and Clay smirk in disbelief.

INT. BEAUFORT HIGH - CORRIDOR - NEXT MORNING

Landon's waiting when Jamie approaches her locker. Her

hair pulled back. She looks good in a simple, fresh way.

Pause. She doesn't help him.          She opens her locker, gets

what she needs.

Pause.   He tries to touch her hair.       She ducks.

CONTINUED:

INT. CAFETERIA - LATER

Jamie sits alone, reading, wearing her old brown sweater.

Landon walks by Clay and Eric at a table.

Puts his tray down on Jamie's table and sits.      Making a

public statement.

She goes back to her book.    Ignoring him.

She doesn't look up.    Shows him the spine:     The Scarlet

Letter.

CONTINUED:

Landon realizes this is why she's always reading.

She doesn't deny it.       He just dives in.

She looks up.    Examines his face for the truth.

Students seated near them have overheard.      Whisper.

She picks up her books and tray.      Everyone is watching.

EXT. PARKING LOT - AFTER SCHOOL

Landon follows Jamie out of the building.      Catches up.

CONTINUED:

She heads to the old Pontiac.       Landon jogs after her.

She gets into her car. Slams the door.        STARTS the

ENGINE. She recognizes the truth.

She drives off. Clay and Eric, watching, guffaw at

Landon's spectacle.

CONTINUED:

EXT. BRIDGE OVER INTERCOASTAL WATERWAY - NIGHT

Landon sits alone. Legs dangling over. Lighting and

dropping matches into the black beyond his feet. His body

caught in the occasional sweep of car headlights.

Nearby, an abandoned car.     A rusty old Yugo.

Landon comes in from outside. Is surprised to find

Cynthia sipping tea, wearing her uniform.

Pause.

Landon doesn't answer.

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE SCIENCE LAB - NEXT AFTERNOON

The door is open to a lab where Jamie and the Star Club is

meeting. Landon mops, working hard, while listening in.

Inside, Jamie ignores him.

Mr. Kelly watches from near the trophy case.      Almost

approving.

Landon grins and moves on. Behind Landon's back, Mr.

Kelly peeks into the science lab. Sees Jamie. Looks back

at Landon. Wonders.

EXT. JEFFERSON HIGH - SATURDAY (DECEMBER)

Landon parks his Camaro.       It's shiny and buffed and

perfect again.

INT. JEFFERSON HIGH - LIBRARY - MINUTES LATER

A Christmas party for the tutors and tutored. A ROCK 'N'

ROLL CHRISTMAS CD plays. A raffle ticket box by the door.

A sign reads: "Win Movie Tickets."

Landon enters, buys a ticket, then takes off his leather

jacket. Underneath, a nice shirt and tie.

LANDON'S POV

Across the room -- Jamie, looking pretty in a dress,

laughing with her student, Isabel. Mr. Kelly talking with

MR. REGINALD ADAMS, principal of Jefferson High.

Luis runs over, diverts Landon's attention.

FRONT OF ROOM

Mr. Adams goes to a microphone.      Taps it.

Applause. This is new. Landon looks at Jamie, who's

smiling. She steps to the microphone.

More applause.    She steps down.

LANDON AND LUIS

Off to one side.

Luis smiles.    Jamie overhears.

She smiles.    He looks at her.

He smiles.

She shakes her head.

CONTINUED:

She walks away.

Landon smiles, not sure why she believes in him.

EXT. CARTER HOUSE - CHRISTMAS EVENING

Hanging on the front door:       a simple evergreen wreath with

a plaid bow.

INT. CARTER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

Dark save for a gilded fake tree lit with tiny blinking

lights and the glow of Cynthia's cigarette in the dark.

Landon comes down the stairs. Sits on the sofa.       Wearing

another good shirt. She tries to reach out.

CONTINUED:

Pause.

He senses her hurt, but leaves anyway.

INT. PARSONAGE - LIVING ROOM - EVENING

A Christmas tree with large colored lights stand in a

corner. Jamie and her father playing cards. The DOORBELL

RINGS. Then urgent BANGING.

EXT. PARSONAGE - FRONT PORCH - MOMENTS LATER

Landon slides his backpack off his shoulder.      Pulls out a

shopping bag. Holds it out to Jamie.

She does. She opens the bag, pulls out a beautiful pink

sweater. She's overwhelmed.

Without a word, just a happy smile, Landon hops down the

steps toward his car. Reverend Sullivan appears in the

doorway.

INT. PARSONAGE - JAMIE'S ROOM - MINUTES LATER

Jamie hums to herself as she brushes her hair. She's

wearing the new sweater. Her father KNOCKS. Enters.

Jamie doesn't answer.

Pause.   He's feeling her grow up, grow away.

They eye each other.    He's losing her.

INT. RETIREMENT HOME - HALLWAY - LATER THAT EVENING

A nurse points Landon toward a patient room.     He carries a

battered liquor-store box.

INT. PATIENT ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

A TV flickers. Landon comes in. Opens the box.      Pulls

out the evergreen wreath with the plaid bow.

Landon leans the wreath in the window. HAROLD KEENE --

the old man from the accident, watches from his bed,

baffled.

Landon pulls a Thermos from his coat pocket.     Unscrews the

cap. Finds a drinking cup. Pours in cider.       Offers

Harold the cup.

Harold takes the cup, looks Landon over.    Landon appears

genuinely contrite.

Pause.

CONTINUED:

Pause.

Harold reaches under his pillow.         Pulls out a small bottle

of liquor. Tops off his cider.

Harold nods, liking Landon.

EXT. RURAL ROADS - LATER THAT NIGHT

Landon speeds, the windows open, WIND WHIPPING, DIRE

STRAITS BLASTING. The Camaro turns and brakes and turns

again, kicking up gravel, raising hell. The car slides to

a stop.

INT. CAMARO

Landon turns OFF the RADIO. Sits still. Wipes the

rearview mirror clean, spotless. Unties the dangling

plastic skeleton and pockets it.

EXT. USED CAR LOT - NEXT MORNING

Colorful banners and flags flap in the brisk WIND.        Landon

talks with a used car SALESMAN.

CONTINUED:

They look at the Camaro.    Shining in the sun.

Landon gazes at another dealership across the street, then

adopts the surly, vaguely-threatening attitude of old.

The Salesman looks from Landon to the car. He pulls a wad

of cash from his pocket. Wearily counts out twelve bills.

Landon takes the money, touches the Camaro's hood, then

walks away.

EXT. BEAUFORT HIGH - FRONT LAWN - NEXT MORNING

The marquee reads, "HAPPY HOLIDAYS!"

EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - SAME TIME

One car. An old station wagon.        At the parking space, a

sign: "School Principal Only."

INT. PRINCIPAL KELLY'S OFFICE

Kelly looks up from paperwork.

Landon drops a folded wad of hundreds on the desk.

CONTINUED:

But his tone implied it and Landon's already gone. Kelly

is immediately sorry. He goes to his window and sees

Landon pedal away on the old bike.

EXT. CARTER DRIVEWAY - NEXT DAY

Landon watches a tow truck lower the abandoned Yugo. When

the car is down, he sees Jamie standing on the sidewalk.

EXT. FOOT OF DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER

He nods, but quickly changes the subject.

INT. HALLWAY BY REVEREND SULLIVAN'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Landon knocks.       The Reverend looks up, furrows his brow.

CONTINUED:

The Reverend makes a small motion and Landon enters.

INT. REVEREND'S OFFICE

Landon doesn't sit.

He looks back to his papers.    End of conversation.

Reverend Sullivan glances up.       As if surprised Landon is

still there.

The Reverend looks out the window. A gray day, cold,

bitter, stark. He considers his options.

EXT./INT. YUGO (CARTER DRIVEWAY) - FEW DAYS LATER

Landon's under the Yugo's hood.     Josh, the kid from next

door, is in the driver's seat.

Josh turns the key. Nothing happens.     Under the hood,

Landon changes something.

Josh tries the engine again.    Still no go.   Landon changes

something else.

Josh tries one more time. The ENGINE ROARS, then DIES,

then amazingly STARTS again. It's running. Landon high-

fives Josh, then sees an old station wagon turn in.

EXT./INT. STATION WAGON - MOMENTS LATER

Kelly hands a paper to Landon.

Landon understands what Kelly is implying.

They shake hands.

INT. LANDON'S BATHROOM - NEW YEAR'S EVE

Landon, dressed with care, faces the mirror and wet combs

his hair.

INT. FLAUVIN'S - HOUR LATER

A seafood joint on the waterfront. Quaint, not fancy.

lovely. Jamie picks.

She watches Landon, happy, then perplexed.

JAMIE'S POV

Landon wolfing down his food.

BACK TO SCENE

INT. YUGO - TRAVELING - NIGHT

Landon drives. The CARS' "Tonight She Comes" PLAYS.   He

belches loudly, dramatically.

CONTINUED:

She grins.    And tries.   A small burp.

He belches again.    Just as loud.   She tries again,

laughing.

EXT. YUGO

Landon steers the car into a parking lot for a miniature

golf course with a castle-shaped video arcade and Little

League diamond. A family entertainment center.

INT. YUGO

Jamie sees where they are.

She waits for more.

CONTINUED:

INT. BATTING CAGE - NIGHT

Jamie's in the cage with a helmet on.    A machine tosses

balls. Landon coaches from outside.

Jamie is laughing too hard to hit anything. The balls

keep coming. She ducks out of the way and grasps the

fence and leans in. Landon leans in on his side. They'd

be embracing if the fence weren't there.

In the b.g., kids from their school.    Giggling,

whispering.

Landon looks over at them.

EXT. HIGHWAY - TRAVELING - NIGHT

The YUGO ROARS down the asphalt.    A sign for the

approaching state line whips by.

INT. YUGO - TRAVELING - NIGHT

Jamie and Landon.    With STEVIE NICKS' "Talk to Me" ON the

RADIO.

CONTINUED:

He grins.    Pulls the car over.

He leaps out, leaving the headlights on.

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

Landon takes Jamie's hand and pulls her toward some

invisible place.

He keeps tugging her.     She follows him.   Laughing.

He leans down and lifts one of her feet a foot from the

other. He notices a large bruise on her leg. She brushes

her dress down.

She's thrilled at his solution to her wish.       He walks to

the shoulder of the road.

Huh?   He does a cartwheel.    She laughs.

EXT. BEACH (NEUSE RIVER) - LATE NIGHT

A starry night with a bright moon. Glimmering silver

water. Jamie and Landon walk onto a dock. DISTANT

FIREWORKS BOOM.

CONTINUED:

They reach the end of the dock. She turns to face the

WIND. It blows her hair. She turns his face the same

way.

He closes his eyes.       Feeling the wind.   Opens them again,

rejecting the idea.

She's embarrassed.       She tries to avoid implying anything.

Her tone is matter-of-fact, but Landon's got a serious and

tender look on his face. He touches her hair.

CONTINUED:

He moves closer.

She looks down.    Shy.

He touches her neck, her cheek, her mouth. Then leans in

and kisses her. A tender, soft kiss. He pulls away.

They look at each other a moment.

There, he put it out there, risked looking and feeling

foolish. Not the old Landon. Jamie looks away. Mixed

emotions. Happy and sad.

She turns back to him, her eyes shining.     She touches his

face and they kiss again, deeply.

But after a few moments, she drops her chin onto his

shoulder. Smiling, glowing even, but slightly aloof,

staring at the water. He pulls away slightly to study her

face. He touches her cheek and brings her back from

wherever she's been.

CONTINUED:

Tears run down her cheeks. Landon wipes them away with

his thumbs, attributing them to happiness.

EXT. PARSONAGE - FRONT PORCH - LATER

Landon follows Jamie up the steps. The lights in the

living room are on. THROUGH the windows, they can see her

father taking down the Christmas tree.

He pulls her to him.      Kisses her.     The front door opens.

Landon and Jamie separate, but Landon keeps an arm over

her shoulder.

Reverend Sullivan studies the two young people.

And he goes. Jamie walks by her father and into the

house. Not saying anything. He watches her. What has he

allowed?

EXT. BEAUFORT HIGH - COURTYARD - DAY

Landon and Jamie head into school.        Landon nods to

Belinda, others. They glare back.

INT. CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

Landon and Jamie arrive at his locker.    It's been kicked

in.

Bang, bang, bang. Landon kicks in every locker in his

row. A dozen in all. Jamie watches, a little frightened

by his anger. But then he turns to her and grins.

INT. CAFETERIA - NOON

Landon eats alone, ignored by Eric and Clay. Jamie

approaches with her tray, red-faced, tearful.

She hesitates about sitting -- feeling bad that Landon's

being diminished, ostracized. She thinks he doesn't see

her. But as she turns to leave, he pulls a chair out for

her and smiles. She sits. Landon sees her face.

The PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM CRACKLES.    Landon takes Jamie's

hand as the room hushes.

EXT. FIRE TOWER (CONSERVATION LAND) - STAIRS - HOUR LATER

Landon leads Jamie up, round and round, to the top of the

tall steel tower.

EXT. TOP OF TOWER - VIEWING AREA

They exit the staircase to a small 360 degree overlook.

Jamie's amazed at the view.

They look off to the curve of the horizon, where sea meets

sky.

He pulls a deck of cards from his jacket pocket. They sit

and he starts to shuffle. Not too well. Jamie takes the

deck. Shuffles like a card shark.

EXT. CEMETERY - REAR GATE - NIGHT (FEW DAYS LATER)

Jamie is already waiting when Landon's Yugo pulls up.       He

gets out, walks to her, they kiss.

She climbs up and over the wall.      He follows.

EXT. INSIDE CEMETERY - MINUTES LATER

Jamie fits the pieces of her telescope together.

CONTINUED:

Landon shakes his head, amazed.

Landon doubts this.

He grins, loving her even more.

He opens his backpack.        Pulls out the contents.

CONTINUED:

Pause.

He reaches back into his backpack.      Pulls out a second

blanket.

He hands her one.     She takes it, smiling, reassured.

REVEREND'S POV

The Yugo parked by the gate.

BACK TO SCENE

The Reverend struggles with what to do. After a moment,

he decides not to interfere; he'll pick his moment. He

keeps driving.

INT. CEMETERY

Jamie and Landon are looking at the heavens through the

telescope.

He draws her close, they kiss. She shyly pulls away.

Their hands still touching until she looks again into the

telescope eyepiece.

She swivels the telescope into position for Jupiter and

steps aside so he can look. But he picks up the

flashlight, pulls a diagram from his pocket.

She takes the diagram, studies it, and adjusts the scope.

CONTINUED:

She couldn't be happier.     She reaches for his hand.

It's the first time he's heard it. He pulls her into his

arms. They kiss. Passionately. She starts to object.

And he does.    They snuggle.   Silence, then:

Long pause.

He doesn't make fun.     He strokes her hair.    Kisses her

forehead.

INT. KITCHEN - 5 AM

Landon enters from outside. Cynthia, still in her

waitress uniform, is sitting at the table, drinking

coffee.

CONTINUED:

Landon doesn't dignify this question with an answer.

She pulls Landon's Life List from her pocket.      Landon is

horrified. She reads it.

Landon doesn't answer. She puts the list on the table.

Smoothes it. Gently discouraging.

CONTINUED:

She doesn't want to discourage him, but she wants him to

be practical and realistic.

Long pause.    They are both sorry to have raised their

voices.

INT. PARSONAGE - SULLIVAN DINING ROOM - EVENING

Landon eats dinner with Jamie and Reverend Sullivan.

Silence, then:

CONTINUED:

Landon searches his mind for just the right subject.

interested.

respect him some.

Jamie showing Landon the junk pile that will become her

newer, larger telescope. They are laughing, jostling each

other, comfortable, happy.

INT. PARSONAGE - SULLIVAN KITCHEN - LATER THAT NIGHT

Reverend Sullivan and Jamie put the dishes away.

She turns to him, upset.    Her anger spilling out.

hundred percent sure.

Their eyes meet.     She knows he's right.

EXT. MOVIE THEATER - EVENING (EARLY FEBRUARY)

Ferris Bueller's Day Off and Three Amigos! on the marquee.

Landon and Jamie exit as Belinda and a new boyfriend buy

tickets. Clay and Eric and a crowd behind them.

She takes her boyfriend's arm, turns away, snubbing him.

and laughs. He's become Landon. Landon reddens, now

realizing for certain that he's become a Jamie Sullivan.

EXT. SIDEWALK (DOWNTOWN BEAUFORT) - MOMENTS LATER

He's impressed with how she manages.

He doesn't notice her tone.

INT. YUGO - TRAVELING - NIGHT

WHITNEY HOUSTON's "How Will I Know?" ON the RADIO. Jamie

flips the RADIO OFF. She's got something on her mind.

Landon notices only that she seems a bit remote.

He looks at her, questioning.       She's looking out her

window.

CONTINUED:

Tears are running down her face.        He pulls the car over.

EXT. WOODS BY SIDE OF ROAD - MOMENTS LATER

Jamie gets out of the car.       Landon quickly follows.

He tries to take her arm. She shakes off his hand, steps

back. Wanting to be heard and understood.

Landon tries to say something.         Nothing comes out.   His

soul numb.

His face crumples with pain and anguish.

CONTINUED:

She gets in the car. Slams her door shut.       He stands

there, not knowing what to do.

EXT. YUGO - TRAVELING - LATER

Landon pulls up in front of Jamie's house.      A long quiet

ride.

Jamie just looks at him.    Feeling sorry for him -- what he

wants doesn't matter.

Reverend Sullivan hears the challenge in his voice.

CONTINUED:

It's a long answer and by the time the Reverend opens his

mouth to explain, Landon's out the door.

Landon's Yugo winds through city streets.

EXT. RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD (RALEIGH) - MINUTES LATER

He flicks his headlights to bright, then low again.

The car turns left.

the heavy wood door. Grief-stricken.

parts the silk drapes in the upstairs hall.

DR. CARTER'S POV

His son standing on the front lawn.     Distraught, tearful.

EXT. DR. CARTER'S HOME

Landon backs away from the house. Angrily kicks over a

decorative planter. Is halfway to his car when Dr. Carter

opens the door and comes out.

Landon doesn't hear.

Landon turns around. Sees his father. Breaks down,

sobbing. His father goes to him. Hugs him, a big bear

hug.

Lights pop upstairs.

Landon pulls away.   Angrier.

CONTINUED:

He waves his father off, dismissing him.

But Landon hasn't heard. He's in his car. Dr. Carter

watches his son's car move away, regretful.

INT. CARTER KITCHEN - DAWN

Landon quietly shuts the back door.        Exhausted.   Starts

making coffee. Cynthia appears.

No response.

Long pause.

EXT. PARSONAGE - EARLY MORNING

Incapable of ringing the bell, lacking the courage,

lacking the right words.

Upstairs, the curtains move.

INT. JAMIE'S BEDROOM

Jamie looks out the window.

JAMIE'S POV

Landon pacing, talking to himself.

BACK TO SCENE

She starts to raise the window, to say something, to help

The sound of a CAR.   She looks out the window again.

JAMIE'S POV

The Yugo driving away.

Frustrated, angry, worried.

Oh.

at another. Searching.

This is JAMIE'S POV from the top of the hallway.

JAMIE

She stands, holding her books, watching him, unsure.

LANDON

finally feels her gaze, turns to look.

JAMIE

turns away, still angry and disappointed.

LANDON

runs to her.

He catches up to her.

JAMIE AND LANDON

face each other.   Neither sure what to say.

She means not even God and he gets this.

He hugs her close, rocking her, comforting her and

himself.

INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - EVENING (MID-FEBRUARY)

she's asleep. Pulls her sweater over her.

Isabel. She looks pale. He catches her eye. They both

smile, a little sadly, then turn back to their students.

INT. YUGO - TRAVELING

Landon drives them home from Jefferson High.      No music.

No response.

He reaches into a cooler on the floor of the back seat.

He places a red heart-shaped box in her lap.

open. Landon's astonished.

Their eyes meet.     Her look is serious.

EXT. PARSONAGE - BACK YARD - NEXT DAY

Reverend Sullivan is up a ladder. Cleaning a gutter.

Landon stands below, a few feet away, gathering his nerve.

He walks over.

ON LADDER

The Reverend is busy ignoring Landon standing below.       A

long beat, then:

CONTINUED:

The Reverend looks down.

Neither Landon nor the Reverend see Jamie come out of the

house and walk over.

ON GROUND

Landon shields his eyes with a hand to see the Reverend

better.

Landon and her father both turn to her.      Pale, wane.   They

understand what she is saying.

She goes into the house. Landon and Reverend Sullivan

look at each other, then away, uncomfortable. That didn't

sound like her.

INT. BEAUFORT HIGH - HALLWAY - MONDAY MORNING

Landon, looking haggard, moves slowly as he cleans out

Jamie's locker.

Students stare as he carefully places her things,

including the pink sweater, in a shopping bag. They part

and hush as he passes by. News travels fast. Clay and

Eric step forward.

CONTINUED:

Landon turns back. Surprised.        Inspects Belinda.   Eric.

Clay. Others. No one speaks.

He pushes past Belinda's new boyfriend, heading for the

office.

INT. PRINCIPAL KELLY'S OFFICE - DAY

Landon nods, accepting, appreciative.

INT. JAMIE'S BEDROOM - LATER

Landon puts away the contents of the shopping bag.

Jamie's in bed, wearing the sweater.

He turns on the CLOCK RADIO next to her bed. Finds a

WALTZ. Offers his hand. Pulls her out of bed. She's in

pajamas.

So they waltz, faking, stumbling and laughing, holding

each other.

INT. PARSONAGE - STAIRCASE - SAME TIME

Reverend Sullivan hears the MUSIC and LAUGHTER.   He

frowns, afraid for Jamie's health.

INT. JAMIE'S BEDROOM

Jamie grips Landon's arms, seems to slip, suddenly too

exhausted to carry her weight. Landon picks her up,

gently carries her back to bed. Settles her in.

Landon sits on her bed. Strokes her hair. They look at

each other. Landon reaches for her hand. When he looks

at her face again, she's asleep.

EXT. LANDON'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - ANOTHER DAY

Landon's sitting on his childhood tree swing, twisting

side to side. Pensive. His mother comes out of the

house.

She reaches to put a hand on his shoulder.       He lets her.

EXT. CEMETERY - EARLY MARCH

The rear gate is open. A caretaker waits while Landon

carries pieces of the older telescope to his car. A tall

pile of parts is already at his car.

Eric and Clay drive up in Eric's pickup.    Gravel flying.

MUSIC BLASTING.

INT. PICKUP

Eric and Clay spy Landon.

EXT. CEMETERY

Landon freezes, not sure what to expect.

EXT. PICKUP

The truck makes a circle around Landon, then stops. The

MUSIC QUIETS. Eric and Clay jump down. A long tense

moment, then:

Without a word, Clay walks to the Yugo, lifts the heaviest

telescope part, and carries it to the bed of the pickup.

Eric follows suit.

EXT. PARSONAGE - BACK YARD - LATER

Landon studies the pieces of the smaller telescope and how

they fit together. They are like a map for how to build

the bigger one.

EXT. PARSONAGE DRIVEWAY - NEXT DAY

Landon unloads an impossibly large round cardboard

concrete form-tube from his car. Carries it around the

house toward the back yard.

INT. JAMIE'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

Jamie wakes from a nap. She looks thinner, grayer. She

hears HAMMERING. She hauls herself up and to a window.

JAMIE'S POV

Landon working on the new telescope.    He looks up at her

window. Sees her there. Smiles.

BACK TO SCENE

Reverend Sullivan comes in to check on Jamie.    She's

standing at the window.

She turns to look at him and collapses into his arms.

INT. HOSPITAL - PATIENT ROOM - NIGHT

Jamie lies in bed, eyes closed. Hooked to monitors,

pumps, an IV drip. Landon holding her hand. Reverend

Sullivan talks quietly with a doctor. Hearing bad news.

EXT. HOSPITAL - DAWN

The sky is pink. A squirrel runs along a telephone wire.

The Yugo is the only car in the visitor lot.

INT. PATIENT ROOM

Landon, in yesterday's clothes, dozes lightly. Jamie

moves and he starts, fully awake. She opens her eyes.

She nods. Sleepy. Closes her eyes again. He rests his

head on her shoulder and weeps. Her eyes open, then close

again. There's nothing to say.

INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE JAMIE'S ROOM - SAME TIME

Reverend Sullivan looks through the window in the door at

the scene within. He hesitates, then pushes the door

open.

INT. PATIENT ROOM

Reverend Sullivan enters.

There's only one chair.    Landon nods and goes.

The Reverend sits, closes his eyes a moment.   When he

opens them, she's looking at him.

He kisses her forehead, then sits back.

Pause.

He lets this sink in.

She looks away, agreeing without saying so.

CONTINUED:

She sits up and embraces him. He wraps his arms around

her. Tight. She closes her eyes, tears welling, never

wanting to let him go. Her father.

EXT. BEAUFORT HIGH SCHOOL - HOUR LATER

On the marquee on the front lawn: "WELCOME HALEY'S

COMET." The Yugo parks in the b.g.

INT. PRINCIPAL KELLY'S OFFICE - MINUTES LATER

Landon picks up a pile of books and assignments.

Looks through them, then eyes Miss Tarbox.

Mr. Kelly steps out of his inner office.      Sees Landon's

anguished face, his exhaustion.

Landon nods his appreciation.

INT. HOSPITAL - PATIENT ROOM - DAY

Jamie looks smaller. Her eyes have blue circles beneath.

The Hemingway novel on the bedstand. Belinda pushes the

door open. Peeks in. Not sure she is welcome.

Landon is sitting in a chair.     He sees her, motions for

her to come in. Quietly.

CONTINUED:

Pause.   Awkwardness.

She hands Landon a small photo album.

She hugs him quickly, then leaves.       Landon goes to the

window, looks out.

SAME SCENE - HOURS LATER

The sky is grayer, darker.      Landon is still at the window.

Jamie wakes.

He goes to her side.

He kisses her.

She reaches under her pillow for the worn book from the

attic. She offers it to Landon.

CONTINUED:

He takes it.

Landon looks at a page.

A bookmark falls out.     He studies that page a moment.

CLOSE ON PASSAGE

from Corinthians.

BACK TO SCENE

Landon reads it.

He takes her hand.     Holds it.

CONTINUED:

He kneels on the floor.       Puts his head on her pillow next

to hers.

He touches her face tenderly.

Pause.   He gets her meaning.

INT. CARTER LIVING ROOM - EVENING

Cynthia pacing, talking on the phone, worried.   The front

door is wide open.

She stands in the doorway and looks out.

CYNTHIA'S POV

Landon in his car in the driveway.

INT. LANDON'S CAR

Landon just sits.    Exhausted, despondent.

INT. CARTER LIVING ROOM

Cynthia pacing.

INT. HOSPITAL - PATIENT ROOM - ANOTHER AFTERNOON

Jamie's breathing is shallower. Landon's reading her The

Sheltering Sky. He pauses, looks up. Isabel, Jamie's

student, is standing in the doorway. Jamie sees her too.

She smiles weakly.

Isabel comes in. Landon offers her the book. She takes

it and keeps going from where Landon left off. Stumbling

but reading. Jamie grins.

Isabel looks shyly at Landon. Jamie shakes her head,

amazed. Landon nods to Isabel and she begins reading

again.

EXT. CARTER BACK STEPS - THAT NIGHT

Landon quietly opens the back door to the kitchen.

HIS POV

Cynthia sits at the table with Dr. Carter, his father.

INT. CARTER KITCHEN

Landon enters, but doesn't sit.

Landon is listening.

He holds out a check.   For a lot of money.   Landon takes

it. Grateful.

INT. PARSONAGE - JAMIE'S BEDROOM - DAY

A smaller Jamie lies in a hospital bed, seemingly asleep.

Hooked to an IV. Bottles of pills. Landon dozes in a

comfortable chair. A nurse sits in a corner, reading.

CONTINUED:

Eric and Clay stand in the doorway, not sure what to do.

Jamie opens her eyes, smiles.

They tiptoe in.    Stand on either side of her bed.

A dumb question but she handles it well.

Awkward pause.

Clay hands her an envelope.

She pulls out a stack of worn bills.

Jamie takes their hands, holds them. Thanking them

silently. Her eyes shining with tears.

INT. LANDON'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

Landon sits at his desk, sketching the larger telescope,

making a few computations.

CONTINUED:

A library book on Haley's Comet is open.      A stack of

similar books by his elbow.

Cynthia enters wearing her waitressing outfit.

He shrugs.    Tears fill his eyes.

Landon thinks his mother is also talking about herself.

Pause.

They embrace.

INT. LANDON'S BEDROOM - LATER

Landon opens Jamie's mother's book.     A photo of Jamie

falls out -- one taken by Belinda.

CLOSE ON PHOTO

Jamie, beautiful, smiling at the audience.

LANDON

considers the photo, finds a page to tuck it into.

CLOSE ON HANDWRITTEN JOTTING

"For Landon" above some underlined text, a Psalm from the

Bible.

Landon knows Jamie underlined this for him.

INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Landon tears down the steps. Past his mother to the front

door. He's out the door before she even turns around.

INT. PARSONAGE - REVEREND SULLIVAN'S BEDROOM - MIDNIGHT

Reverend Sullivan sits up in bed. His feet find slippers

on the floor. He looks haggard, his hair thinner, his

face defeated.

INT. JAMIE'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

The Reverend, wearing his robe, checks on his sleeping

daughter. The night nurse nods as he tucks in blankets.

A SOUND. Then another. Reverend Sullivan goes to the

window. Parts the drapes. Looks out.

HIS POV

A dozen flashlights in a big circle. Landon in the

middle, working feverishly on the new telescope.

EXT. BACK YARD - MOMENTS LATER

The back porch light comes on. Reverend Sullivan steps

out onto the back porch. Landon looks up.

CONTINUED:

Without a word, the Reverend turns around and goes back

inside. Leaving the porch light on. Landon goes back to

work.

EXT. BACK YARD - MINUTES LATER

Reverend Sullivan comes out. Dressed. He carries two

mugs of coffee and a brightly burning kerosene camp

lantern. Peace offerings.

He walks over, sets down the lantern, hands Landon a mug.

Ready to work.

As they walk to the garage.

The Reverend nods, impressed.    He yanks the garage door

up. Goes in.

CONTINUED:

The Reverend carries out a large cardboard postal package.

Landon takes it as the Reverend lowers the garage door.

Reverend Sullivan searches Landon's face for a long

moment, understanding, then turns and heads for the back

door.

INT. CHURCH - REVEREND'S OFFICE - NEXT MORNING

Landon stands in the doorway. The Reverend is wiping his

glasses, his face, maybe of tears. He sees Landon.

Long pause.

The Reverend stands, offers Landon his hand.     Landon takes

it. The two men shake. Allies now.

INT. JAMIE'S ROOM - THAT EVENING

Jamie opens her eyes. But can barely keep them open.

Groggy from pain medication. Landon's standing there.

Showered, clean clothes.

CONTINUED:

He starts helping the nurse disconnect her IV.

Jamie looks at the nurse.    Uncertain.     The nurse nods.

EXT. PARSONAGE ROOF - NIGHT

Landon carries Jamie out a large attic window. The

finished large telescope is set up. Pointing at the sky.

She's in her nightgown, wrapped in a blanket.

But she looks at the lights of the house and streets

around them.

He checks his watch.

As she turns to him, questioning, the neighborhood

suddenly darkens as the street lamps and lights in every

nearby house are switched off.

EXT. DOWN STREET

Neighbors step outside.    Hold up binoculars.

EXT. BEAUFORT HIGH - PARKING LOT

Members of the Star Club and other students look through

traditional telescopes.

EXT. PARSONAGE ROOF

Jamie hugs Landon in gratitude.

Jamie, tears streaming, braces herself against Landon and

she peers into the telescope eyepiece. She pulls back,

wipes her eyes, then looks again. She swings the

telescope into the correct position.

HER POV THROUGH TELESCOPE

Haley's Comet, its icy nucleus issuing the jets and

streamers of gas, dust, and debris that form the comet's

hazy head and long tail.

BACK TO SCENE

She steps back so he can see. He looks quickly, then

moves aside so she can keep looking. She's completely

engrossed. A long, quiet moment, then:

She leans away from the eyepiece and looks at him -- yes.

His throat tightens with nervousness, with hope, fear,

sadness, and love.

HER FACE

Illness, happiness, disbelief.

EXT. SOUTHERN BAPTIST CHURCH - EARLY APRIL

A sea of pink, purple, and white blossoms.    Dogwoods,

wisteria, azaleas, and roses blooming.

INT. SOUTHERN BAPTIST CHURCH

Bursting with everyone who knows Jamie and Landon -- every

kid in their high school, including Eric, Clay, Belinda;

teachers, including Ms. Garber; Mr. Kelly; Luis and Isabel

and others from Jefferson High; her father's congregation;

Cynthia Carter; Dr. Carter's new wife and their two kids;

neighbors; hospital staff and home nurses.

Landon stands with his father by the altar.

The "WEDDING MARCH" begins...

The double doors at the back of the church open. Everyone

turns to look at the bride. Gasps of joy and sadness.

LANDON'S POV - JAMIE

Flanked by a nurse and Reverend Sullivan. She's wearing

her Lizzie dress from the play. It hangs loosely, but

still becomes her. She's a beautiful bride.

BACK TO SCENE

Landon swells with pride.

Jamie smiles. Then, leaning on her father, she slowly

makes her way down the aisle.

In the pews -- few dry eyes follow her.

Jamie -- halfway -- stops to rest and catch her breath.     A

moment later, she and her father continue.

A long, difficult walk.    A walk to remember.

AT ALTAR

The nurse rolls a wheelchair up as Jamie and her father

near.

Applause breaks out as Jamie reaches Landon's side.

Jamie sits.   Exhausted.

CONTINUED:

Landon kneels to be the same height as Jamie in her chair.

Pause.   Dr. Carter kneels.   Showing solidarity with his

son.

Reverend Sullivan, standing, leans down to kiss Jamie's

cheek. Trying to keep his emotions in check.

LANDON AND JAMIE'S POV

Reverend Sullivan towering over them.

BACK TO SCENE

Reverend Sullivan kneels, too.

Jamie takes Landon's hand in her right hand, her father's

hand in her left. Linking the three together.

The congregation silences.

Reverend Sullivan looks up from his Bible.     Struggling.

He reaches out, offering a hand to Landon.     Completing the

circle.

As words are spoken and vows and rings exchanged, the

CAMERA MOVES ACROSS the faces of those at the altar --

Jamie, Landon, Dr. Carter.

TO the first row of the congregation -- Cynthia Carter,

Josh, Eric, Clay.

Then BACK row by row as the Reverend begins reading a

passage from the book Jamie's mother made for her. His

voice soft and melodious, like a poet reading his own

work.

CONTINUED:

And the CAMERA MOVES OUT the double doors to find...

PARSONAGE

in a different season.      Winter.

UP the front steps and INTO...

LIVING ROOM (PRESENT DAY)

As it is now, in present day.

The nurse disappears, leaving Landon Carter, 33, waiting.

Looking at a framed photo of Jamie as Lizzie in The

Rainmaker...

The nurse returns, helping an old man as he shuffles in.

Reverend Sullivan. He's stooped, thin, balding. His skin

parchment thin.

The two men embrace.       Stiff, uncomfortable, uncertain.

Pause.   Why is he here?     The Reverend waits.

He twists the ring on his finger.      Removes it.

CONTINUED:

He gives his wedding ring to the Reverend.          Pause.   Landon

searches for something meaningful to say.

The Reverend turns away, overcome with sadness.         Realizing

now why Landon has come.

Landon is grateful to know this.       He makes a move to go.

Then turns back.

Landon, deeply touched, embraces the old man again.

Warmly, fully. Two men still grieving, saying good-bye.

EXT. NEUSE RIVER - THAT AFTERNOON

Landon walks alone.      His hair and clothing tousled by a

steady gentle wind.

Landon stops.       Faces the wind.   Lets the air swirl over

him.

CONTINUED:

He closes his eyes.    She's there...
