American Heritage Dictionary: New College Edition

INT. COFFEE SHOP  MORNING

A normal Denny's, Spires-like coffee shop in Los Angeles.

It's about 9:00 in the morning. While the place isn't jammed,

there's a healthy number of people drinking coffee, munching

on bacon and eating eggs.

Two of these people are a YOUNG MAN and a YOUNG WOMAN. The

Young Man has a slight working-class English accent and,

like his fellow countryman, smokes cigarettes like they're

going out of style.

It is impossible to tell where the Young Woman is from or

how old she is; everything she does contradicts something

she did. The boy and girl sit in a booth. Their dialogue is

to be said in a rapid pace "HIS GIRL FRIDAY" fashion.

The boy and girl laugh, their laughter putting a pause in

there, back and forth.

A WAITRESS comes by with a pot of coffee.

The Waitress pours the Young Woman's coffee. The Young Man

lights up another cigarette.

The Waitress leaves. The Young Man takes a drag off of his

smoke.

The Young Woman pours a ton of cream and sugar into her

coffee.

The Young Man goes right back into it.

He calls to the Waitress.

Then looks to his girl.

The Waitress comes by, pouring him some more.

She splits.

The Young Woman visibly takes in the idea. The Young Man

continues in a low voice.

The Young Woman scans the restaurant with this new

information.

She sees all the PATRONS eating, lost in conversations. The

tired WAITRESS, taking orders. The BUSBOYS going through the

motions, collecting dishes. The MANAGER complaining to the

COOK about something. A smiles breaks out on the Young Woman's

face.

They both take out their .32-caliber pistols and lay them on

the table. He looks at her and she back at him.

And with that, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny grab their weapons,

stand up and rob the restaurant. Pumpkin's robbery persona

is that of the in-control professional. Honey Bunny's is

that of the psychopathic, hair-triggered, loose cannon.

CREDIT SEQUENCE:

INT. '74 CHEVY (MOVING)  MORNING

An old gas guzzling, dirty, white 1974 Chevy Nova BARRELS

down a homeless-ridden street in Hollywood. In the front

seat are two young fellas  one white, one black  both

wearing cheap black suits with thin black ties under long

green dusters. Their names are VINCENT VEGA (white) and JULES

WINNFIELD (black). Jules is behind the wheel.

INT. CHEVY (TRUNK)  MORNING

The trunk of the Chevy OPENS UP, Jules and Vincent reach

inside, taking out two .45 Automatics, loading and cocking

them.

They CLOSE the trunk.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING COURTYARD  MORNING

Vincent and Jules, their long matching overcoats practically

dragging on the ground, walk through the courtyard of what

looks like a hacienda-style Hollywood apartment building.

We TRACK alongside.

They enter the apartment building.

INT. RECEPTION AREA (APARTMENT BUILDING)  MORNING

Vincent and Jules walk through the reception area and wait

for the elevator.

The elevator arrives, the men step inside.

INT. ELEVATOR  MORNING

Jules nods his head: "Yes."

Jules nods his head: "Yes."

The elevator doors open, Jules and Vincent exit.

INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY  MORNING

STEADICAM in front of Jules and Vincent as they make a beeline

down the hall.

Jules stops Vincent.

Jules looks at him a long moment  he's been set up.

He starts walking down the hall.  Vincent, smiling, walks a

little bit behind.

The two men stand in front of the door numbered "49." They

whisper.

They move a little away from the door, facing each other,

still whispering.

Making a gun out of his finger and placing it to his head.

Jules just looks at him.

Jules just looks at him.

INT. APARTMENT (ROOM 49)  MORNING

THREE YOUNG GUYS, obviously in over their heads, sit at a

table with hamburgers, french fries and soda pops laid out.

One of them flips the LOUD BOLT on the door, opening it to

REVEAL Jules and Vincent in the hallway.

The two men stroll inside.

The three young caught-off-guard Guys are:

MARVIN, the black young man, who open the door, will, as the

scene progresses, back into the corner.

ROGER, a young blond-haired surfer kid with a "Flock of

Seagulls" haircut, who has yet to say a word, sits at the

table with a big sloppy hamburger in his hand.

BRETT, a white, preppy-looking sort with a blow-dry haircut.

Vincent and Jules take in the place, with their hands in

their pockets. Jules is the one who does the talking.

No answer.

As Jules and Brett talk, Vincent moves behind the young Guys.

Brett shakes his head: "No."

No answer.

Jules grabs the burger and take a bite of it.

Jules holds out the Big Kahuna.

Jules grabs the cup and takes a sip.

Roger nods his head: "Yes."

Vincent moves to the bed, reaches underneath it, pulling out

a black snap briefcase.

Vincent flips the two locks, opening the case. We can't see

what's inside, but a small glow emits from the case. Vincent

just stares at it, transfixed.

No answer from the transfixed Vincent.

Vincent looks up at Jules.

Closing the case.

As Brett talks, Jules takes out his gun and SHOOTS Roger

three times in the chest, BLOWING him out of his chair.

Vince smiles to himself. Jules has got style.

Brett has just shit his pants. He's not crying or whimpering,

but he's so full of fear, it's as if his body is imploding.

Brett can't say a word.

Brett still can't speak.

Jules SNAPS, SAVAGELY TIPPING the card table over, removing

the only barrier between himself and Brett. Brett now sits

in a lone chair before Jules like a political prisoner in

front of an interrogator.

Jules takes his .45 and PRESSES the barrel HARD in Brett's

cheek.

Brett is regressing on the spot.

Brett does his best.

Jules' eyes go to Vincent, Vincent smirks, Jules rolls his

eyes and SHOOT Brett in the shoulder.

Brett SCREAMS, breaking into a SHAKING/TREMBLING SPASM in

the chair.

Now in a lower voice.

The two men EMPTY their guns at the same time on the sitting

Brett.

AGAINST BLACK, TITLE CARD:

FADE IN:

MEDIUM SHOT  BUTCH COOLIDGE

We FADE UP on BUTCH COOLIDGE, a white, 26-year-old

prizefighter.  Butch sits at a table wearing a red and blue

high school athletic jacket. Talking to him OFF SCREEN is

everybody's boss MARSELLUS WALLACE. The black man sounds

like a cross between a gangster and a king.

A hand lays an envelope full of money on the table in front

of Butch. Butch picks it up.

Butch nods his head: "yes."

INT. CAR (MOVING)  DAY

Vincent Vega looks really cool behind the wheel of a 1964

cherry red Chevy Malibu convertible. From the car radio,

ROCKABILLY MUSIC PLAYS. The b.g. is a COLORFUL PROCESS SHOT.

EXT. SALLY LEROY'S  DAY

Sally LeRoy's is a large topless bar by LAX that Marsellus

owns.

Vincent's classic Malibu WHIPS into the near empty parking

lot and parks next to a white Honda Civic.

Vince knocks on the door. The front entrance is unlocked,

revealing the Dapper Dan fellow on the inside: ENGLISH DAVE.

Dave isn't really English, he's a young black man from Baldwin

Park, who has run a few clubs for Marsellus, including Sally

LeRoy's.

Vincent, carrying the black briefcase from the scene between

Vincent and Jules, steps inside. English Dave SLAMS the door

in our faces.

INT. SALLY LEROY'S  DAY

The spacious club is empty this time of day. English Dave

crosses to the bar, and Vince follows.

VINCENT'S POV: Butch shakes hands with a huge figure with

his back to us. The huge figure is the infamous and as of

yet still UNSEEN Marsellus.

English Dave smiles to himself.

English Dave puts Vince's coffee in front of him.

Butch bellies up to the bar next to Vincent, drinking his

cup of "Plain ol' American."

While Butch waits for his smokes, Vincent just sips his

coffee, staring at him. Butch looks over at him.

Butch does a slow turn toward Vincent.

Butch turns his body to Vincent, when...

Vincent walks forward OUT OF FRAME, never giving Butch another

glance. We DOLLY INTO CU on Butch, left alone in the FRAME,

looking like he's ready to go into the manners-teaching

business.

BUTCH'S POV: Vincent hugging and kissing the obscured figure

that is Marsellus.

Butch makes the wise decision that is this asshole's a friend

of Marsellus, he better let it go  for now.

Butch is snapped out of his ass-kicking thoughts. He pays

English Dave and walks out of the SHOT.

INT. LANCE'S HOUSE (KITCHEN)  NIGHT

CLOSEUP  JODY

A woman who appears to have a fondness for earrings. Both of

her ears are pierced five times. She also sports rings in

her lips, eyebrows and nose.

Jody, Vincent and a young woman named TRUDI sit at the kitchen

table of a suburban house in Echo Park. Even though Vince is

at the same table, he's not included in the conversation.

Vince has been letting this conversation go through one ear

and out the other, until that last remark.

Jody looks at him and says as if it were the most obvious

thing in the world.

That thought never occurred to Vincent, but he can't deny it

makes sense. Jody continues talking to Trudi, leaving Vincent

to ponder the truth of her statement.

INT. LANCE'S BEDROOM  NIGHT

Lance, late 20s, is a young man with a wild and woolly

appearance that goes hand-in-hand with his wild and woolly

personality. LANCE has been selling drugs his entire adult

life. He's never had a day job, never filed a tax return and

has never been arrested. He wears a red flannel shirt over a

"Speed Racer" tee-shirt.

Three bags of heroin lie on Lance's bed.

Lance and Vincent stand at the foot of the bed.

Vincent takes out a roll of money that would choke a horse

to death.

Vincent and Lance giggle at the "faux pas."

Vincent takes out his case of the works (utensils for shooting

up).

Vincent takes his works out of his case and, as the two

continue to talk, Vince shoots up.

As he cooks his heroin...

CLOSEUP  THE NEEDLE

Going into Vincent's vein.

CLOSEUP  BLOOD

Spurting back into the syringe, mixing with the heroin.

Music in.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM  NIGHT

Vincent enters on the background.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / DRESSING ROOM  NIGHT

Vincent turns.

INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / DRESSING ROOM  NIGHT

wall.

Mia walks into the room, and takes the needle off a record.

The Dusty Springfield song stops.

EXT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S  NIGHT

In the past six years, 50's diners have sprung up all over

L.A., giving Thai restaurants a run for their money. They're

all basically the same. Decor out of an "Archie" comic book,

Golden Oldies constantly emanating from a bubbly Wurlitzer,

saucy waitresses in bobby socks, menus with items like the

Fats Domino Cheeseburger, or the Wolfman Jack Omelet, and

over prices that pay for all this bullshit.

But then there's JACKRABBIT SLIM'S, the big mama of 50's

diners.

Either the best or the worst, depending on your point of

view.

Vincent's Malibu pulls up to the restaurant. A big sign with

a neon figure of a cartoon surly cool cat jackrabbit in a

red windbreaker towers over the establishment. Underneath

the cartoon is the name: JACKRABBIT SLIM'S. Underneath that

is the slogan: "Next best thing to a time machine."

Mia draws a square with her hands. Dotted lines appear on

the screen, forming a sqaure. The lines disperse.

INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S  NIGHT

Compared to the interior, the exterior was that of a quaint

English pub. Posters from 50's A.I.P. movies are all over

the wall

("ROCK ALL NIGHT," "HIGH SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL," "ATTACK OF

THE CRAB MONSTER," and "MACHINE GUN KELLY"). The booths that

the patrons sit in are made out of the cut up bodies of 50s

cars.

In the middle of the restaurant in a dance floor. A big sign

on the wall states, "No shoes allowed." Some wannabe beboppers

(actually Melrose-types), do the twist in their socks or

barefeet.

The picture windows don't look out the street, but instead,

B & W movies of 50's street scenes play behind them. The

WAITRESSES and WAITERS are made up as replicas of 50's icons:

MARILYN MONROE, ZORRO, JAMES DEAN, DONNA REED, MARTIN and

LEWIS, and THE PHILIP MORRIS MIDGET, wait on tables wearing

appropriate costumes.

Vincent and Mia study the menu in a booth made out of a red

'59 Edsel. BUDDY HOLLY (their waiter), comes over, sporting

a big button on his chest that says: "Hi I'm Buddy, pleasing

you please me."

Buddy exits.

Vincent takes a look around the place. The YUPPIES are

dancing, the DINERS are biting into big, juicy hamburgers,

and the icons are playing their parts. Marilyn is squealing,

The Midget is paging Philip Morris, Donna Reed is making her

customers drink their milk, and Dean and Jerry are acting a

fool.

Vincent takes out his pouch of tobacco and begins rolling

himself a smoke.

After a second of watching him

As he finishes licking it

He hands her the rolled smoke. She takes it, putting it to

her lips. Out of nowhere appears a Zippo lighter in Vincent's

hand. He lights it.

He begins rolling one for himself.

As this time, the SOUND of a subway car fills the diner,

making everything SHAKE and RATTLE. Marilyn Monroe runs to a

square vent in the floor. An imaginary subway train BLOWS

the skirt of her white dress around her ears as she lets out

a squeal. The entire restaurant applauds.

Back to Mia and Vincent.

Buddy comes back with the drinks. Mia wraps her lips around

the straw of her shake.

She slides the shake over to him.

Vincent smiles.

He takes a sip.

He slides the shake back.

Then the first of an uncomfortable silence happens.

INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (LADIES ROOM)  NIGHT

Mia powders her nose by doing a big line of coke off the

bathroom sink. Her head jerks up from the rush.

INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S (DINING AREA)  NIGHT

Vincent digs into his Douglas Sirk steak. As he chews, his

eyes scan the Hellsapopinish restaurant.

Mia comes back to the table.

Pointing at Marilyn in the white dress serving a table.

Then, pointing at a BLONDE WAITRESS in a tight sweater and

capri pants, taking an order from a bunch of FILM GEEKS

Mia nods her head: "Yes."

Mia and Vincent smile.

Vincent is slow to answer.

ED SULLIVAN AND MARILYN MONROE STAND ON STAGE

Patrons cheer.

Ed Sullivan is with Marilyn Monroe, who holds a trophy.

Marilyn holds the trophy.

Mia holds her hand.

Vincent reacts.

Vincent and Mia walk onto the dance floor, toward Ed Sullivan.

Patrons cheer.

Vincent and Mia walk up to the microphone.

Mia and Vincent dance to Chuck Berry's "YOU NEVER CAN TELL".

They make hand movements as they dance.

INT. MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOME  NIGHT

The front door FLINGS open, and Mia and Vincent dance tango-

style into the house, singing a cappella the song from the

previous scene. They finish their little dance, laughing.

Then...

The two just stand face to face looking at each other.

Mia moves away to attend to both. Vincent hangs up his

overcoat on a big bronze coat rack in the alcove.

Vincent shuffles off to the john.

Mia moves to her CD player, thumbs through a stack of CDs

and selects one: k.d. lang. The speakers BLAST OUT a high

energy country number, which Mia plays air-guitar to. She

dances her way around the room and finds herself by Vincent's

overcoat hanging on the rack. She touches its sleeve. It

feels good.

Her hand hoes in its pocket and pulls out his tobacco pouch.

Like a little girl playing cowboy, she spreads the tobacco

on some rolling paper. Imitating what he did earlier, licks

the paper and rolls it into a pretty good cigarette. Maybe a

little too fat, but not bad for a first try. Mia thinks so

anyway. Her hand reaches back in the pocket and pulls out

his Zippo lighter. She SLAPS the lighter against her leg,

trying to light it fancy-style like Vince did. What do you

know, she did it! Mia's one happy clam. She triumphantly

brings the fat flame up to her fat smoke, lighting it up,

then LOUDLY SNAPS the Zippo closed.

The Mia-made cigarette is brought up to her lips, and she

takes a long, cool drag. Her hand slides the Zippo back in

the overcoat pocket. But wait, her fingers touch something

else. Those fingers bring out a plastic bag with white powder

inside, the madman that Vincent bought earlier from Lance.

Wearing a big smile, Mia brings the bag of heroin up to her

face.

INT. BATHROOM (MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE)  NIGHT

Vincent stands at the sink, washing his hands, talking to

himself in the mirror.

LIVING ROOM

Mia has the unbeknownst-to-her heroin cut up into big lines

on her glass top coffee table. Taking her trusty hundred

dollar bill like a human Dust-Buster, she quickly snorts the

fat line.

CLOSEUP  MIA

Her head JERKS back. Her hands go to her nose (which feels

like it's on fucking fire), something is terribly wrong.

Then... the rush hits...

BATHROOM

Vincent dries his hands on a towel while he continues his

dialogue with the mirror.

LIVING ROOM

Mia is on all fours trying to crawl to the bathroom, but

it's like she's trying to crawl with the bones removed from

her knees. Blood begins to drip from Mia's nose. Then her

stomach gets into the act and she VOMITS.

BATHROOM

Vince continues.

Now that he's given himself a little pep talk, Vincent's

ready for whatever's waiting for him on the other side of

that door. So he goes through it.

LIVING ROOM

We follow behind Vincent as he walks from the bathroom to

the living room, where he finds Mia lying on the floor like

a rag doll. She's twisted on her back. Blood and puke are

down her front. And her face is contorted. Not out of the

tightness of pain, but just the opposite, the muscles in her

face are so relaxed, she lies still with her mouth wide open.

Slack-jawed.

Vincent moves like greased lightning to Mia's fallen body.

Bending down where she lays, he puts his fingers on her neck

to check her pulse. She slightly stirs.

Mia is aware of Vincent over her, speaking to her.

But she's unable to communicate Mia makes a few lost mumbles,

but they're not distinctive enough to be called words.

Vincent props her eyelids open and sees the story.

Mia is incapable of answering. He SLAPS her face hard.

Vincent SPRINGS up and RUNS to his overcoat, hanging on the

rack.

He goes through the pockets FRANTICALLY. It's gone. Vincent

makes a beeline to Mia. We follow.

He reaches her and hoists the dead weight up in his arms.

We follow behind as he hurriedly walks the practically-

unconscious Mia through the house and out the front door.

EXT. VINCENT'S HOT ROD (MOVING)  NIGHT

INSERT SPEEDOMETER: red needle on a hundred.

Vincent driving like a madman in a town without traffic laws,

speeds the car into turns and up and over hills.

INT.VINCENT'S HOT ROD (MOVING)  NIGHT

Vincent, one hand firmly on the wheel, the other shifting

like Robocop, both eyes staring straight ahead except when

he glances over at Mia.

Mia, slack-jawed expression, mouth gaping, posture of a bag

of water.

Vincent takes a cellular phone out of his pocket. He punches

a number.

INT. LANCE'S HOUSE  NIGHT

At this late hour, LANCE has transformed from a bon vivant

drug dealer to a bathrobe creature.

He sits in a big comfy chair, ratty blue gym pants, a worn-

out but comfortable tee-shirt that has, written on it, "TAFT,

CALIFORNIA", and a moth-ridden terry cloth robe. In his hand

is a bowl of Cap'n Crunch with Crunch Berries. In front of

him on the coffee table is a jug of milk, the box the Cap'n

Crunch with Crunch Berries came out of, and a hash pipe in

an ashtray.

On the big-screen TV in front of the table is the Three

Stooges, and they're getting married.

The phone RINGS.

Lance puts down his cereal and makes his way to the phone.

It RINGS again.

Jody, his wife, CALLS from the bedroom, obviously woken up.

VINCENT IN THE MALIBU

Vincent is still driving like a stripe-assed ape, clutching

the phone to his ear. WE CUT BACK AND FORTH during the

conversation.

At that moment inside Lance's house, WE HEAR VINCENT's Malibu

coming up the street. Lance hangs up the phone, goes to his

curtains and YANKS the cord. The curtains open with a WHOOSH

in time to see Vincent's Malibu DRIVING UP on his front lawn

and CRASHING into his house. The window Lance is looking out

of SHATTERS from the impact.

Lance CHARGES from the window, out the door to his front

lawn.

EXT. LANCE'S HOUSE  NIGHT

Vincent is already out of the car, working on getting Mia

out.

INT. LANCE'S HOUSE  NIGHT

WE START in Lance's and Jody's bedroom.

Jody, in bed, throws off the covers and stands up. She's

wearing a long tee-shirt with a picture of Fred Flintstone

on it.

We follow HANDHELD behind her as she opens the door, walking

through the hall into the living room.

As she walks in the living room, she sees Vincent and Lance

standing over Mia, who's lying on the floor in the middle of

the room.

From here on in, everything in this scene is frantic, like a

DOCUMENTARY in an emergency ward, with the big difference

here being nobody knows what the fuck they're doing.

Lance looks up at Jody.

She angrily turns and disappears into the bedroom looking

for the shot.

WE MOVE into the room with the two men.

WE FOLLOW Lance as he runs out of the living room into a...

INT. SPARE ROOM

With a bunch of junk in it. He frantically starts scanning

the junk for the book he's looking for, repeating the words,

"Come on," endlessly.

From OFF SCREEN we hear:

Lance continues his frenzied search.

WE HEAR Jody in the living room now as she talks to Vincent.

Jody calls to LANCE.

As he continues searching, flipping and knocking over shit,

Jody appears in the doorway.

Lance spins toward her.

Lance angrily knocks over a pile of shit and leaves the SHOT

heading for the living room.

LIVING ROOM

Vincent is bent over Mia, talking softly to her, when Lance

reenters the room.

Lance bends down by the black case brought in by Jody. He

opens it and begins preparing the needle for injection.

Vince rips her blouse open.

Jody stumbles back in the room, hanging back from the action.

Vince points to Mia's right breast.  Lance glances over and

nods.

As Lance readies the injection, Vincent looks up at Jody.

Jody runs to the desk, opens the top drawer and, in her

enthusiasm, she pulls the drawer out of the desk, the contents

of which (bills, papers, pens) spill to the floor.

The injection is ready. Lance hands Vincent the needle.

Jody hurriedly joins them in the huddle, a big fat red magic

marker in her hand.

Vincent grabs the magic marker out of Jody's hand and makes

a big red dot on Mia's body where her heart is.

Lance demonstrates a stabbing motion, which looks like "The

Shape" killing its victims in "HALLOWEEN".

Then once you do, push down on the plunger.

Vincent lifts the needle up above his head in a stabbing

motion.

He looks down on Mia.

Mia is fading fast. Soon nothing will help her.

Vincent's eyes narrow, ready to do this.

Lance, on this knees right beside Vincent, does not know

what to expect.

RED DOT on Mia's body.

Needle raised ready to strike.

Jody's face is alive with anticipation.

NEEDLE in that air, poised like a rattler ready to strike.

The needle leaves frame, THRUSTING down hard.

Vincent brings the needle down hard, STABBING Mia in the

chest.

Mia's head is JOLTED from the impact.

The syringe plunger is pushed down, PUMPING the adrenaline

out through the needle.

Mia's eyes POP WIDE OPEN and she lets out a HELLISH cry of

the banshee. She BOLTS UP in a sitting position, needle stuck

in her chest  SCREAMING.

Vincent, Lance and Jody, who were in sitting positions in

front of Mia, JUMP BACK, scared to death.

Mia's scream runs out. She slowly starts taking breaths of

air.

The other three, now scooted halfway across the room, shaken

to their bones, look to see if she's alright.

Mia, still breathing, not looking up at them, says in a

relatively normal voice.

Vincent and Lance collapse on their backs, exhausted and

shaking from how close to death Mia came.

INT. VINCENT'S MALIBU (MOVING)  NIGHT

Vincent is behind the wheel driving Mia home. No one says

anything, both are still too shaken.

EXT. FRONT OF MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE  NIGHT

The Malibu pulls up to the front. Mia gets out without saying

a word (still in a daze) and begins walking down the walkway

toward her front door.

She turns around.

Vincent's out of the car, standing on the walkway, a big

distance between the two.

Mia smiles.

The two walk toward each other, holding out their hands to

shake and shake they do.

Mia lets go of Vincent's hand and silently makes the see-no-

evil, hear-no-evil, and speak-no-evil sign with her hands.

Vincent smiles.

Mia giggles.

Vincent turns to leave.

Vincent turns around.

They both smile, but neither laugh.

Mia turns and walks inside her house.

CLOSEUP  VINCENT

After Mia walks inside. Vincent continues to look at where

she was. He brings his hands to his lips and blows her a

kiss. Then exits FRAME leaving it empty. WE HEAR his Malibu

START UP and DRIVE AWAY.

FADE UP On the cartoon "SPEED RACER."  Speed is giving a

detailed description of all the features on his race car

"The Mac-5," which he does at the beginning of every episode.

OFF SCREEN we hear a WOMAN'S VOICE... .

BUTCH'S POV

We're in the living room of a modest two bedroom house in

Alhambra, California, in the year 1972. BUTCH'S MOTHER, 35ish,

stands in the doorway leading into the living room. Next to

her is a man dressed in the uniform of an American Air Force

officer. The CAMERA is the perspective of a five-year old

boy.

CAPT. KOONS steps inside the room toward the little boy and

bends down on one knee to bring him even with the boy's

eyeline. When Koons speaks, he speaks with a slight Texas

accent.

The Captain pulls a gold wrist watch out of his pocket.

Capt. Koons hands the watch to Butch. A little hand comes

into FRAME to accept it.

INT. LOCKER ROOM  NIGHT

The 27-year old Butch Coolidge is dressed in boxing regalia:

trunks, shoes and gloves. He lies on a table catching a few

zzzzzz's before his big fight. Almost as soon as WE CUT to

him, he wakes up with a start. Shaken by the bizarre memory,

he wipes his sweaty face with his boxing glove.

His trainer KLONDIKE, an older fireplug, opens the door a

little, sticking his head in the room. Pandemonium seems to

be breaking out behind Klondike in the hallway.

Klondike steps inside, closing the door on the WILD MOB

outside.

He goes to the long yellow robe hanging on a hook. Butch

hops off the table and, without a word, Klondike helps him

on with the robe, which says on the back: "BATTLING BUTCH

COOLIDGE".

The two men head for the door. Klondike opens the door for

Butch.

As Butch steps into the hallway, the Crowd goes apeshit.

Klondike closes the door behind him, leaving us in the quiet,

empty locker room.

TITLE CARD:

We hear over the black and white title:

The SOUND of chaos in the b.g.

FADE IN:

EXT. ALLEY (RAINING)  NIGHT

A taxi is parked in a dark alley next to an auditorium. The

sky is PISSIN' DOWN RAIN. WE SLOWLY DOLLY toward the parked

car. The SOUND of the CAR RADIO can be heard coming from

inside.

INT. TAXI (PARKED/RAINING)  NIGHT

Inside the taxi, behind the wheel, is a female cabbie named

ESMARELDA VILLALOBOS. A young woman, with Spanish looks,

sits parked, drinking a steaming hot cup of coffee out of a

white styrofoam cup.

The Sportscasters continue their coverage.

CLICK  Esmarelda shuts off the radio.

She takes a sip of coffee, then hears a NOISE behind her in

the alley. She sticks her head out of the car door to see:

EXT. BOXING AUDITORIUM (RAINING)  NIGHT

A window about three stories high opens on the auditorium-

side of the alley. A gym bag is tossed out into a garbage

dumpster below the window. Then, Butch Coolidge, still dressed

in boxing trunks, shoes, gloves and yellow robe, LEAPS to

the dumpster below.

ESMARELDA'S REACTION takes in the strangeness of this sight.

Gym bag in hand, Butch CLIMBS out of the dumpster and RUNS

to the taxi. Before he climbs in, he takes off his robe and

throws it to the ground.

INT. TAXI (PARKED / RAINING)  NIGHT

Butch, soaking wet, naked except for trunks, shoes and gloves,

HOPS in the backseat, SLAMMING the door.

Esmarelda, staring straight ahead, talks to Butch through

the rearview mirror:

The ignition key is TWISTED. The engine ROARS to life.

The meter is FLIPPED on.

Esmarelda's bare foot STOMPS on the gas pedal.

EXT. BOXING AUDITORIUM (RAINING)  NIGHT

The cab WHIPS out of the alley, FISH-TAILING on the wet

pavement in front of the auditorium at a rapid pace.

INT. WILLIS LOCKER ROOM (AUDITORIUM)  NIGHT

Locker room door opens, English Dave fights his way through

the pandemonium which is going on outside in the hall,

shutting the door on the madness. Once inside, English Dave

takes time to adjust his suit and tie. Mia is standing by

the door. She sees Vincent with English Dave.

In the room, black boxer FLOYD RAY WILLIS lies on a table

dead.

His face looks like he went dunking for bees. His TRAINER is

on his knees, head on Floyd's chest, crying over the body.

The huge figure that is Marsellus Wallace stands at the table,

hand on the Trainer's shoulder, lending emotional support.

We still do not see Marsellus clearly, only that he is big.

Mia sits in a chair at the far end of the room.

Marsellus looks up, sees English Dave and walks over to him.

INT. CAB (MOVING / RAINING)  NIGHT

Butch gets one of his boxing gloves off.

Esmeralda watches in the rearview mirror.

He tries to roll down one of the backseat windows, but can't

find the roll bar.

She presses a button and the back window moves down. Butch

tosses his boxing glove out the window, then starts untying

the other one.

Esmeralda can't keep quiet anymore.

As he tosses his other glove out the window.

He finished wiping himself down.

He tosses the towel out the window.

Silence, as Butch digs in his bag for a t-shirt.

Butch pulls on his tee-shirt.

Esmarelda bounces in her seat with excitement.

Butch leans forward. Esmarelda, keeping her eyes on the road,

passes a cigarette back to him. He takes it. Then, still not

looking behind her, she brings up her hand, a lit match in

it.

Butch lights his smoke, then blows out the match.

He takes a long drag.

He looks at her license.

Esmarelda nods her head: "yes."

EXT. PHONE BOOTH (RAINING)  NIGHT

We DOLLY around a phone booth as Butch talks inside.

Butch hangs up the phone. He looks at the cab waiting to

take him wherever he wants to go.

EXT. MOTEL (STOPPED / RAINING)  NIGHT

Esmeralda's taxi pulled into the motel parking lot. The rain

has stopped, but the night is still soaked. Butch gets out,

now fully dressed in tee-shirt, jeans and high school athletic

jacket. He leans in the driver's side window.

Handing her the money.

Butch holds up a hundred dollar bill.

Esmarelda's eyes light up. She goes to take it. Butch holds

it out of reach.

He gives her the bill.

He tweaks her nose, she smiles, and he turns and walks away.

She drives off.

INT. MOTEL (ROOM SIX)  NIGHT

Butch enters and turns on the light.

Lying curled up on the bed, fully dressed, with her back to

us is Butch's French girlfriend, FABIENNE.

Butch flicks the switch back, making the room dark again.

Butch climbs into bed, spooning Fabienne from behind.

When Butch and Fabienne speak to each other, they speak in

babytalk.

Fabienne rolls over and Butch gets on top of her. They kiss.

Butch nods his head: "yes."

Butch nods his head: "yes."

Butch nods his head: "no."

Butch nods his head: "yes."

Butch's hand goes out of frame and starts massaging her

crotch.

Fabienne reacts.

Fabienne lies her head back.

Butch continues to massage her crotch.

Butch kisses her on the mouth.

She nods her head: "yes."

Butch's head goes down out of frame to carry out the oral

pleasure. Fabienne's face is alone in the frame.

FADE UP:

MOTEL ROOM

Same motel room, except empty. WE HEAR THE SHOWER RUNNING in

the bathroom. The CAMERA MOVES to the bathroom doorway. We

see Fabienne in a white terry cloth robe that seems to swallow

her up.

She's drying her head with a towel. Butch is inside the shower

washing up. We see the outline of his naked body through the

smoky glass of the shower door. Steam fills the bathroom.

Butch turns the shower off and opens the door, popping his

head out.

She finishes drying her hair and wraps the towel like a turban

on her head.

She hands him a towel.

Butch exits the bathroom. We stay on Fabienne as she brushes

her teeth.

Butch keeps on from the other room.

Fabienne brushes her teeth. We watch her for a moment or

two, then she remember something.

She walks out of the bathroom to ask Butch a question, only

to find him sound asleep in bed.

She looks at him for a moment.

She exits frame, going back in the bathroom. WE STAY on the

WIDE SHOT of the unconscious Butch in bed.

FADE UP:

MOTEL ROOM  MORNING

SAME SHOT AS BEFORE, the next morning. We find Butch still

asleep in bed.

Fabienne brushes her teeth half in and half out of the

bathroom so she can watch TV at the same time. She still

wears the terry cloth robe from the night before.

ON TV: WILLIAM SMITH and a BUNCH OF HELL'S ANGELS are taking

on the entire Vietnamese army in the film "THE LOSERS".

Butch wakes from his sleep, as if a scary monster was chasing

him.

His start startles Fabienne.

Butch squints down the front of the bed at her, trying to

focus.

Butch, still trying to chase the cobwebs away, sees on TV

Hell's Angels tear-assin' through a Vietnamese prison camp.

Fabienne enters the room.

She reaches over and turns off the TV.

Fabienne laughs.

Laying on top of him.

She kisses Butch.

Fabienne gives Butch a sweet long kiss.

Butch climbs out of bed and starts pulling clothes out of

the suitcase that Fabienne brought.

Butch is finished dressing.

As he goes through the suitcase.

By now, Butch is frantically rummaging through the suitcase.

He's now throwing clothes.

Fabienne can hardly speak, she's never seen Butch this way.

Fabienne is crying and scared.

Butch lowers his voice, which only serves to make him more

menacing.

Butch freaks out, he punches the air.

Fabienne SCREAMS and backs into a corner, Butch picks up the

motel TV and THROWS IT AGAINST the wall.

Fabienne SCREAMS IN HORROR.

Butch looks toward her, suddenly calm.

He bends down in front of the woman who has sunk to the floor.

He touches her hand, she flinches.

He kisses her hand. Then rises.

Fabienne is still sniffling.

Butch goes to the closet.

Butch puts on his high school jacket.

Rising from the floor.

Butch brings her close and puts his hands on her face.

He kisses her once more and heads for the door.

And with that, he's out the door.

Fabienne sits on the bed and looks at the money he gave her.

INT. HONDA (MOVING)  DAY

Butch is beating the steering wheel and the dash with his

fists as he drives down the street.

EXT. CITY STREET  DAY

The little Honda races toward its destination as fast as is

little engine will take it.

A parking meter red flag rises up, then out, leaving the

arrow pointing at one hour.

EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET CORNER  DAY

Butch isn't completely reckless. He has parked his car a

couple of blocks from his apartment to check things out before

he goes boppin' through the front door.

EXT. ALLEY  DAY

Butch walks down the alley until he gets to another street,

then he discreetly glances out.

EXT. STREET  BUTCH'S APARTMENT  DAY

Everything seems normal. More or less the right number of

cars in the street. None of the parked cars appear out of

place. None of them have a couple of goons sitting inside.

Basically, it looks like normal morning activity in front of

Butch's home.

Butch peers around a wall, taking in the vital information.

Butch walks out of the alley and is ready for anything. He

crosses the street and enters his apartment courtyard.

Across the street from Butch's building, on the corner, is a

combination donut shop and Japanese restaurant. A big sign

sticks up in the air, with the name "Teriyaki Donut" and a

graphic of a donut sticking out of a bowl of rice.

EXT. BUTCH'S APARTMENT COURTYARD  DAY

Butch is in the courtyard of his North Hollywood apartment

building. Once again, everything appears normal  the laundry

room, the pool, his apartment door  nothing appears

disturbed.

Butch climbs the stairs leading to his apartment, number 12.

He steps outside the door and listens inside. Nothing.

Butch slowly inserts the key into the door, quietly opening

it.

INT. BUTCH'S APARTMENT  DAY

His apartment hasn't been touched.

He cautiously steps inside, shuts the door and takes a quick

look around. Obviously, no one is there.

Butch walks into his modest kitchen, and opens the

refrigerator.

He takes out a carton of milk and drinks from it.

With carton in hard, Butch surveys the apartment. Then he

goes to the bedroom.

His bedroom is like the rest of the apartment  neat, clean

and anonymous. The only things personal in his room are a

few boxing trophies, an Olympic silver medal, a framed issue

of "Ring Magazine" with Butch on the cover, and a poster of

Jerry Quarry and one of George Chuvalo.

Sure enough, there's the watch just like he said it was: On

the bedside table, hanging on his little kangaroo statue.

He walks through the apartment and back into the kitchen. He

opens a cupboard and takes out a box of Pop Tarts. Putting

down the milk, he opens the box, takes out two Pop Tarts and

puts them in the toaster.

Butch glances to his right, his eyes fall on something.

What he sees is a small compact Czech M61 submachine gun

with a huge silencer on it, lying on his kitchen counter.

He picks up the intimidating peace of weaponry and examines

it.

Then... a toilet FLUSHES.

Butch looks up to the bathroom door, which is parallel to

the kitchen. There is someone behind it.

Like a rabbit caught in a radish patch, Butch freezes, not

knowing what to do.

The bathroom door opens and Vincent Vega steps out of the

bathroom, tightening his belt. In his hand is the book

"MODESTY BLAISE" by Peter O'Donnell.

Vincent and Butch lock eyes.

Vincent freezes.

Butch doesn't move, except to point the M61 in Vincent's

direction.

Neither man opens his mouth.

Then... the toaster LOUDLY kicks up the Pop Tarts.

That's all the situation needed.

Butch's finger HITS the trigger.

MUFFLED FIRE SHOOTS out of the end of the gun.

Vincent is seemingly WRACKED with twenty bullets

SIMULTANEOUSLY  LIFTING him off his feet, PROPELLING him

through the air and CRASHING through the glass shower door

at the end of the bathroom.

By the time Butch removes his finger from the trigger, Vincent

is annihilated.

Butch stands frozen, amazed at what just happened. His look

goes from the grease spot in the bathroom that was once

Vincent, down to the powerful piece of artillery in his grip.

With the respect it deserves, Butch carefully places the M61

back on the kitchen counter.

Then he exits the apartment, quickly.

EXT. APARTMENT COURTYARD  DAY

Butch, not running, but walking very rapidly, crosses the

courtyard...

...comes out of the apartment building, crosses the street...

...goes through the alley...

...and into his car in one STEADICAM SHOT.

EXT. HONDA  DAY

Butch CRANKS the car into gear and drives away. The big wide

smile of a survivor breaks across his face.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING STREET  DAY

The Honda turns down the alley and slowly cruises by his

apartment building.

INT. HONDA  DAY

Butch looks out the window at his former home.

This makes the boxer laugh out loud. As he laughs, he flips

a tape in the cassette player. When the MUSIC starts, he

SINGS along with it.

He drives by the apartment, but is stopped at the light on

the corner across from Teriyaki Donut.

Butch is still chuckling, singing along with the song, as we

see:

THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

The big man himself, Marsellus Wallace, exit Teriyaki Donut,

carrying a box of a dozen donuts and two large styrofoam

cups of coffee. He steps off the curb, crossing the street

in front of Butch's car. This is the first time we see

Marsellus clearly.

Laughing boy stops when he sees the big man directly in front

of him.

When Marsellus is in front of Butch's car, he casually glances

to his left, sees Butch, continues walking... then STOPS!

DOUBLE-TAKE: "Am I really seeing what I'm seeing?"

Butch doesn't wait for the big man to answer his own question.

He STOMPS on the gas pedal.

The little Honda SLAMS into Marsellus, sending him, the donuts

and the coffee HITTING the pavement at thirty miles an hour.

Butch CUTS into cross traffic and is BROAD-SIDED by a gold

Camaro Z-28, BREAKING all the windows in the Honda and sending

it up on the sidewalk.

Butch sits dazed and confused in the crumpled mess of what

at one time was Fabienne's Honda. Blood flows from his

nostrils. The still-functional tape player continues to play.

A PEDESTRIAN pokes his head inside.

Butch look at him, spaced-out.

Marsellus Wallace lies sprawled out in the street. GAWKERS

gather around the body.

This jerk's yelling makes Marsellus come to.

TWO PEDESTRIANS help the shaken Butch out of the wreckage.

The woozy Marsellus gets to his feet.

Marsellus follows the Gawker's finger and sees Butch Coolidge

down the street, looking a shambles.

The big man takes out a .45 Automatic and the Gawkers back

away.

Marsellus starts moving toward Butch.

Butch sees the fierce figure making a wobbly bee-line toward

him.

Marsellus brings up his weapon and FIRES, but he's so hurt,

shaky and dazed that his arm goes wild.

He HITS a LOOKY-LOO WOMAN in the hip. She falls to the ground,

screaming.

That's all Butch needs to see. He's outta here.

Marsellus RUNS after him.

The CROWD looks agape.

Butch is in a mad, limping RUN.

The big man's hot on his ass with a cockeyed wobbly run.

Butch cuts across traffic and dashes into a business with a

sign that reads "MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP".

INT. MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP  DAY

MAYNARD, a hillbilly-lookin' boy, stands behind the counter

of his pawnshop when, all of a sudden, chaos in the form of

Butch RACES into his world.

Butch quickly takes measure of the situation, than stands

next to the door.

Before Maynard can finish his threat, Marsellus CHARGES in.

He doesn't get past the doorway because Butch LANDS his fist

in Marsellus' face.

The gangster's feet go out from under him and the big man

FALLS FLAT on his back.

Outside, two police cars with their SIRENS BLARING race by.

Butch POUNCES on the fallen body, PUNCHING him twice more in

the face.

Butch takes the gun out of Marsellus' hand, than grabs ahold

of his middle finger.

He BREAKS the finger. Marsellus lets out a pain sound.  Butch

then places the barrel of the .45 between his eyes, PULLS

back the hammer and places his open hand behind the gun to

shield the splatter.

Butch and Marsellus look up at Maynard, who's brandishing a

pumpaction shotgun, aimed at the two men.

Butch does.

Butch slowly gets up and moves to the counter. As soon as he

gets there, Maynard HAULS OFF, HITTING him hard in the face

with the butt of the shotgun, knocking Butch down and out.

After Butch goes down, Maynard calmly lays the shotgun on

the counter and moves to the telephone.

Marsellus Wallace, from his position on the floor, groggily

watches the pawnshop owner dial a number. Maynard waits on

the line while the other end rings. Then it picks up.

Marsellus passes out.

FADE UP:

INT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM  DAY

TWO SHOT  BUTCH AND MARSELLUS

They are tied up in two separate chairs. In their mouths are

two S&M-style ball gags (a belt goes around their heads and

a little red ball sticks in their mouths). Both men are

unconscious.

Maynard steps in with a fire extinguisher and SPRAYS both

guys until they're wide awake and wet as otters. The two

prisoners look up at their captors.

Maynard stands in front of them, fire extinguisher in one

hand, shotgun in the other, and Marsellus' .45 sticking in

his belt.

A BUZZER buzzes.

Without saying another word, Maynard climbs up the stairs

that lead to red curtains and goes through them.

WE HEAR, on the other side of the curtains, Maynard let Zed

inside the store.

Butch and Marsellus look around the room. The basement of

the pawnshop has been converted into a dungeon. After taking

in their predicament, Butch and Marsellus look at each other,

all traces of hostility gone, replaced by a terror they both

share at what they've gotten themselves into.

Maynard and ZED come through the curtains. Zed is an even

more intense version of Maynard, if such a thing is possible.

The two hillbillys are obviously brothers. Where Maynard is

a vicious pitbull, Zed is a deadly cobra. Zed walks in and

stands in front of the two captives. He inspects them for a

long time, then says:

Butch makes no reply.

Maynard opens a trap door in the floor.

Maynard reaches into the hole and comes back holding onto a

leash.

He gives it a rough yank and, from below the floor, rises

THE GIMP.

The Gimp is a man they keep dressed from head to toe in black

leather bondage gear. There are zippers, buckles and studs

here and there on the body. On his head is a black leather

mask with two eye holes and a zipper (closed) for a mouth.

They keep him in a hole in the floor big enough for a large

dog.

Zed takes the chair, sits it in front of the two prisoners,

then lowers into it. Maynard hands The Gimp's leash to Zed,

then backs away.

The Gimp gets on its knees.

Maynard hangs back while Zed appraises the two men.

Then with his little finger, Zed does a silent "Eenie, meany,

miney, moe... " just his mouth mouthing the words and his

finger going back and forth between the two.

Butch are Marsellus are terrified.

Maynard looks back and forth at the victims.

The Gimps's eyes go from one to the other inside the mask.

Zed continues his silent sing-song with his finger moving

left to right, then it stops.

TWO SHOT  BUTCH AND MARSELLUS

After a beat, THE CAMERA MOVES to the right, zeroing in on

Marsellus.

Zed stands up.

Zed grabs Marsellus' chair and DRAGS him into Russell's old

room.

Russell, no doubt, was some other poor bastard that has the

misfortune of stumbling into the Mason-Dixie pawnshop.

Whatever happened to Russell is known only to Maynard and

Zed because his old room, a back room in the back of the

back room, is empty.

As Marsellus is dragged away, he locks eyes with Butch before

he disappears behind the door of Russell's old room.

The Gimp rises. Maynard ties The Gimp's leash to a hook on

the ceiling.

The Gimp bows its head: "yes." Maynard disappears into

Russell's old room. There must be a stereo in there because

suddenly The Judds, singing in harmony, fills the air.

Butch looks at The Gimp. The Gimp giggles from underneath

the mask as if this were the funniest moment in the history

of comedy.

From behind the door we hear country MUSIC, struggling, and:

We the HEAR Maynard and Zed beat on Marsellus.

Butch pauses, listens to the voices. Then, in a panic,

hurriedly struggles to get free.

The Gimp is laughing wildly.

The ropes are on too tight and Butch can't break free.

The Gimp slaps his knee laughing In the back room, we hear:

Butch stops struggling and lifts up on his arms. Then, quite

easily, the padded chair back slides up and off as if it

were never connected by a bolt.

The Gimp sees this and its eyes widen.

The Gimp FLAILS WILDLY, trying to get the leash off the hook.

He tries to yell, but all that comes out are excited gurgles

and grunts.

Butch is out of his chair, quickly dispensing three BOXER'S

PUNCHES to its face. The punches knock The Gimp out, making

him fall to his knees, this HANGING HIMSELF by the leash

attached to the hook, Butch removes the ball gag, then

silently makes his way through the red curtains.

INT. PAWNSHOP  DAY

Butch sneaks to the door.

On the counter is a big set of keys with a large Z connected

to the ring. Grabbing them, he's about to go out when he

stops and listens to the hillbilly psychopaths having their

way with Marsellus.

Butch decides for the life of him, he can't leave anybody in

a situation like that. Se he begins rooting around the

pawnshop for a weapon to bash those hillbillies' heads in

with.

He picks up a big destructive-looking hammer, then discards

it: Not destructive enough. He picks up a chainsaw, thinks

about it for a moment, then puts it back. Next, a large

Louisville slugger he tries on for size. But then he spots

what he's been looking for:

A Samurai sword.

It hands in its hand-carved wood sheath from a nail on the

wall, next to a neon "DAD'S OLD-FASHIONED ROOT BEER" sign.

Butch takes the sword off the wall, removing it from its

sheath. It's a magnificent piece of steel. It seems to glisten

in the low-wattage light of the pawnshop. Butch touches his

thumb to the blade to see if the sword is just for show. Not

on your life. It's as sharp as it gets. This weapon seems

made to order for the Brothers Grimm downstairs. Holding the

sword pointed downward, Takakura Kenstyle, he disappears

through the red curtains to take care of business.

INT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM  DAY

Butch quietly sneaks down the stairs leading to the dungeon.

Sodomy and the Judds can still be heard going string behind

the closed door that leads to Russell's old room.

INT. RUSSELL'S OLD ROOM  DAY

Butch's hand comes into frame, pushing the door open. It

swings open silently, revealing the rapists, who have switched

positions.

Zed is now bent over Marsellus, who is bent over a wooden

horse.

Maynard watches. Both have their backs to Butch.

Maynard faces the CAMERA, grinning, while Butch comes up

behind him with the sword.

Miserable, violated, and looking like a rag doll, Marsellus,

red ball gag still in mouth, opens his watery eyes to see

Butch coming up behind Maynard. His eyes widen.

Maynard turns and sees Butch holding the sword.

Butch SCREAMS... with one mighty SWING, SLASHES Maynard across

the front, moving past him, eyes and blade now locked on

Zed.

Maynard stands trembling, his front sliced open, in shock.

Butch, while never taking his eyes off Zed, THRUSTS the sword

behind him, SKEWERING Maynard, then EXTRACTS it, pointing

the blade toward Zed. Maynard COLLAPSES.

Zed disengages from Marsellus in a hurry and his eyes go

from the tip of Butch's sword to Marsellus' .45 Automatic,

which lies within reach.

Butch's eyes follow Zed's.

Zed's hand inches toward the weapon.

Butch GRIPS the sword tighter.

Zed studies Butch.

Butch looks hard at Zed.

Then a VOICE says:

Butch steps aside, REVEALING Marsellus standing behind him,

holding Maynard's pump-action shotgun.

KABOOM!!!!

Zed is BLASTED in the groin. Down he goes, SCREAMING in AGONY.

Marsellus, looking down at his whimpering rapist, EJECTS the

used shotgun shell.

Butch lowers the sword and hangs back. Not a word, until:

Long pause.

The two men shake hands, then hug one another.

Butch leaves Russell's old room through the red curtains.

Marsellus walks over to a phone, dialing a number.

EXT. MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP  DAY

Butch, still shaking in his boots, exits the pawnshop. He

looks ahead and sees, parked in front of the establishment,

Zed's Big Chrome Chopper with a teardrop gas tank that has

the name "GRACE" on it. He climbs aboard, takes out the keys

with the big Z on them and starts up the huge hog. It RUMBLES

to life, making sounds like a rocket fighting for orbit.

Butch twists the accelerator handle and SPEEDS off.

WE CUT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN...

INT. BUTCH AND FABIENNE'S HOTEL ROOM  DAY

Fabienne stands in front of a mirror wearing a "Frankie says,

Relax" tee-shirt, singing along with MUSIC coming from a

BOOM BOX.

EXT. CITY STREET  CHOPPER (MOVING)  DAY

Butch drives down the street, humping a hot hog named "GRACE."

He checks his father's watch. It says: 10:30.

The SONG in the motel room PLAYS OVER this.

EXT. MOTEL ROOM  DAY

Butch rides up on Grace. He hops off and runs inside the

motel room, while we stay outside with the bike.

Butch runs out and hops back on the bike. Fabienne exits the

motel room with the boom box and a large purse. When she

sees Butch on the chopper, she stops dead.

Fabienne slowly approaches the two-wheel demon.

She doesn't move.

Butch looks at her.

Fabienne starts to cry.

Butch realizes that this is not the way to get her on the

bike. He turns off the engine and reaches out, taking her

hand.

Fabienne does climb on. Butch STARTS her up.

And with that, the two lovebirds PEEL AWAY on Grace, as the

SONG on the BOOM BOX RISES.

TITLE CARD:

TITLE DISAPPEARS.

Over black, we can HEAR in the distance, men talking.

FADE UP:

INT. BATHROOM  DAY

We're in the bathroom of the Hollywood apartment we were in

earlier. In fact, we're there at exactly the same time. Except

this time, we're in the bathroom with the FOURTH MAN. The

Fourth Man is pacing around the small room, listening hard

to what's being said on the other side of the door, tightly

CLUTCHING his huge silver .357 Magnum.

BANG! BANG! BOOM! POW! BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM!

The Fourth Man freaks out. He THROWS himself against the

back wall, gun outstretched in front of him, a look of yellow

fear on his face, ready to blow in half anybody fool enough

to stick their head through that door.

Then he listens to them talk.

Waiting for them isn't the smartest move. Bursting out the

door and blowing them all away while they're fuckin' around

is the way to go.

INT. APARTMENT  DAY

The bathroom door BURSTS OPEN and the Fourth Man CHARGES

out, silver Magnum raised, FIRING SIX BOOMING SHOTS from his

hand cannon.

DOLLY INTO Fourth Man, same as before.

He SCREAM until he's dry firing. Then a look of confusion

crosses his face.

TWO SHOT  JULES AND VINCENT

Standing next to each other, unharmed. Amazing as it seems,

none of the Fourth Man's shots appear to have hit anybody.

Jules and Vincent exchange looks like, "Are we hit?" They're

as confused at the shooter. After looking at each other,

they bring their looks up to the Fourth Man.

The Fourth Man is taken out of the scenario by the two men's

bullets who, unlike his, HIT their marks. He drops DEAD.

The two men lower their guns. Jules, obviously shaken, sits

down in a chair. Vincent, after a moment of respect, shrugs

it off.

Then heads toward Marvin in the corner.

Jules rises, moving toward Vincent.

Vincent prepares to leave.

EXT. HOLLYWOOD APARTMENT BUILDING  MORNING

The Chevy Nova PROPELS itself into traffic.

INT. NOVA (MOVING)  MORNING

Jules is behind the wheel,Vincent in the passenger seat and

Marvin in the back.

Vincent turns to the backseat with the .45 casually in his

grip.

Vincent's .45 goes BANG!

Marvin is hit in the upper chest, below the throat. He GURGLES

blood and SHAKES.

Jules takes out a cellular phone and starts punching digits.

INT. JIMMIE'S BATHROOM  DAY

Jules is bent over a sink, washing his bloody hands while

Vincent stands behind him.

Jules rises and dries his hands. Vincent takes his place at

the sink.

Vincent finishes, then dries his hands on a white towel.

When Vincent is finished drying his hands, the towel is

stained with red.

INT. JIMMIE'S KITCHEN  MORNING

Three men are standing in Jimmie's kitchen, each with a mug

of coffee. Jules, Vincent and JIMMIE DIMMICK, a young man in

his late 20s dressed in a bathrobe.

Jules starts to "Jimmie" him

Jules starts to "Jimmie" him.

INT. MARSELLUS WALLACE'S DINING ROOM  MORNING

Marsellus Wallace sits at his dining table in a big comfy

robe, eating his large breakfast, while talking on the phone.

INT. JIMMIE'S BEDROOM  MORNING

Jules paces around in Jimmie's bedroom on the phone.

INT. HOTEL SUITE  MORNING

The CAMERA looks through the bedroom doorway of a hotel suite

into the main area. We SEE a crap game being played on a

fancy crap table by GAMBLERS in tuxedos and LUCKY LADIES in

fancy evening gowns. The CAMERA PANS to the right revealing:

Sitting on a bed, phone in hand with his back to us, the

tuxedo-clad WINSTON WOLF aka "THE WOLF". We also see The

Wolf has a small notepad that he jots details in.

We SEE his book. The page has written on it:

HE WRITES:

He hangs up. We never see his face.

TITLE CARD OVER BLACK:

EXT. JIMMIE'S STREET  MORNING

A silver Porsche WHIPS the corner leading to Jimmie's home,

in HYPER DRIVE. Easily doing 135 mph, the Porsche stops on a

dime in front of Jimmie's house.

A ringed finger touches the doorbell: DING DONG.

INT. JIMMIE'S HOUSE  MORNING

Jimmie opens the door. We see, standing in the doorway, the

tuxedo-clad man. He looks down to his notebook, then up at

Jimmie.

In the dining room, Jules and Vincent stand up.

INT. JIMMIE'S GARAGE  MORNING

The three men hang back as The Wolf examines the car. He

studies the car in silence, opening the door, looking inside,

circling it.

Jimmie exists. The Wolf continues his examination.

INT. KITCHEN  MORNING

Jimmie hands The Wolf a cup of coffee.

He takes a sip, then, pacing as he thinks, lays out for the

three men the plan of action.

The Wolf and Jimmie turn, heading for the bedroom, leaving

Vincent and Jules standing in the kitchen.

The Wolf stops and turns around.

The Wolf takes a step toward him.

INT. JIMMIE'S BEDROOM  MORNING

Jimmie's gathering all the bedspreads, quilts and linen he

has.

The Wolf is on the phone.

Jimmie comes over with a handful of linen.

INT. GARAGE  MORNING

Both Jules and Vincent are inside the car cleaning it up.

Vincent is in the front seat washing windows, while Jules is

in the backseat, picking up little pieces of skull and gobs

of brain.

Both are twice as bloody as they were before.

INT. CHEVY NOVA  MORNING

The interior of the car has been cleaned and lined with

bedspreads and quilts. Believe it or not, what looked like a

portable slaughterhouse can actually pass for a non-descript

vehicle.

The Wolf circles the car examining it.

Jules and Vincent stand aside, their clothes are literally a

bloody mess, but they do have a sense of pride in what a

good job they've done.

EXT. JIMMIE'S BACKYARD  MORNING

Jules and Vincent stand side by side in their black suits,

covered in blood, in Jimmie's backyard. Jimmie holds a plastic

Hefty trash bag, while The Wolf holds a garden hose with one

of those guns nozzles attached.

As they follow directions, The Wolf enjoys a smoke.

He hands the now-naked men a bar of soap.

He hits the trigger, water SHOOTS OUT, SMACKING both men.

The two men, trembling, scrub themselves.

The Wolf stops the hose, tossing it on the ground.

Jimmie tosses them each a towel, which they rub furiously

across their bodies.

FADE UP ON:

JULES AND VINCENT In their tee-shirts and swim trunks. They

look a million miles away from the black-suited, bad-asses

we first met.

The Wolf and Jimmie laugh.

INT. JIMMIE'S GARAGE  MORNING

The garbage bag is tossed in the car trunk on top of Marvin.

The Wolf SLAMS is closed.

EXT. MONSTER JOE'S TRUCK AND TOW  MORNING

Jules and Vincent wait by Winston's Porsche.

Jules and Vincent bump fists.

Winston laughs, the boys groan.

Winston grabs Jules' wrist and pantomimes like he's in a

"DEAD ZONE" trance.

Winston turns to leave.

He turns around.

The Wolf smiles.

He turns and banters with Raquel as they get in the Porsche.

The Porsche SHOOTS OFF down the road.

The two men left alone look at each other.

INT. COFFEE SHOP  MORNING

Jules and Vincent sit at a booth. In front of Vincent is a

big stack of pancakes and sausages, which he eats with gusto.

Jules, on the other hand, just has a cup of coffee and a

muffin. He seems far away in thought. The Waitress pours a

refill for both men,

The two men laugh.

Vincent takes a bite of food. Jules takes a sip of coffee In

the b.g., we see a PATRON call the Waitress.

We recognize the patron to be Pumpkin from the first scene

of Pumpkin and Honey Bunny.

Vincent exits for the restroom.

Jules, alone, takes a mouthful of muffin, then... Pumpkin

and Honey Bunny rise with guns raised.

Jules looks up, not believing what he's seeing. Under the

table, Jules' hand goes to his .45 Automatic. He pulls it

out, COCKING IT.

Like lightning, Pumpkin moves over to the kitchen. While

Honey Bunny SCREAMS out threats to the PATRONS, keeping them

terrified.

Three COOKS and two BUSBOYS come out of the kitchen.

They comprende. The portly MANAGER speaks up.

Pumpkin heads his way.

He reaches him and sticks the barrel of his gun hard in the

Manager's neck.

The Patrons SCREAM. Jules watches all this silently, his

hand tightly gripping the .45 Automatic under the table.

INT. COFFEE SHOP BATHROOM  MORNING

Vincent, on the toilet, oblivious to the pandemonium outside,

reads his "MODESTY BLAISE" book.

INT. COFFEE SHOP  MORNING

Cash register drawer opens. Pumpkin stuffs the money from

the till in his pocket. Then walks from behind the counter

with a trash bag in his hand.

Pumpkin goes around collecting wallets. Jules sits with his

.45 ready to spit under the table.

Pumpkin sees Jules sitting in his booth, holding his wallet,

briefcase next to him. Pumpkin crosses to him, his tone more

respectful, him manner more on guard.

Jules DROPS his wallet in the bag. Using his gun as a pointer,

Pumpkin points to the briefcase.

Jules' free hand lays palm flat on the briefcase.

Pumpkin is definitely surprised by his answer. He aims the

gun right in the middle of Jules' face and pulls back the

hammer.

This exchange has been kind of quiet, not everybody heard

it, but Honey Bunny senses something's wrong.

Jules raises his hand off the briefcase.

Jules flips the locks and opens the case, revealing it to

Pumpkin but not to us. The same light SHINES from the case.

Pumpkin's expression goes to amazement. Honey Bunny, across

the room, can't see shit.

Jules nods his head: "yes."

Jules nods his head: "yes."

Jules SLAMS the case closed, then sits back, as if offering

the case to Pumpkin. Pumpkin, one big smile, bends over to

pick up the case.

Like a rattlesnake, Jules' free hand GRABS the wrist of

Pumpkin's gun hand, SLAMMING it on the table. His other hand

comes from under the table and STICKS the barrel of his .45

hand under Pumpkin's chin.

Honey Bunny freaks out, waving her gun in Jules' direction.

Whenever Jules talks to Yolanda, he never looks at her, only

at Pumpkin.

No answer.

Pumpkin looks at him.

Pumpkin lets go of his gun and places both hands on the table.

Yolanda can't stand it anymore.

Yolanda WHIPS her gun toward the stranger.

Vincent, by the bathroom, has his gun out, dead-aimed at

Yolanda.

Pumpkin looks in the bag and  sure enough  there's a wallet

with "Bad Motherfucker" embroidered on it.

Jules lowers his gun, lying it on the table.

Pumpkin looks at him, to the money in his hand, then to

Yolanda.

She looks back.

Grabbing the trash bag full of wallets, the two RUN out the

door.

Jules, who was never risen from his seat the whole time,

takes a sip of coffee.

He pushes it aside.

Vincent appears next to Jules.

Vincent throws some money on the table and Jules grabs the

briefcase.

Then, to the amazement of the Patrons, the Waitresses, the

Cooks, the Bus Boys, and the Manager, these two bad-ass dudes

swim trunks, thongs and packing .45 Automatics  walk out of

the coffee shop together without saying a word.
