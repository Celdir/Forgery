OVER BLACK

We hear, Ja Rule's "Livin' It Up"...

EXT. NEW YORK CITY - A HOT AUGUST NIGHT - MUSIC OVER

MIDTOWN. A Brunette Beauty crosses in front of a stack of

cabs, her sheer dress clinging to her remarkable body.

A Club in THE MEATPACKING DISTRICT. A long line waits to get

in. A couple of Gorgeous Girls show up at the velvet rope and

are promptly" let inside.

SOHO. A Crowd spills out of a Bar and onto the sidewalk. A

Confident Knock Out in jeans and a tank top laughs, drinking

a beer out of the bottle.

INTO AN EMPTY FRAME COMES HARRY LANGER

What is it about him? Could be his eyes, the turn of his

mouth...something about this guy is just so damn appealing.

Maybe it's just the way he wears the Young Slinky Girl on his

arm. He's confident, cool, enviable. We're in:

A CHIC EATERY - DOWNTOWN

The place is full. Everybody is somebody here.

The Maitre'd snaps to attention at the sight of him.

As Harry and his Girl wend their way around tables, we pass Other

Couples. Young Couples. Middle-aged couples. Not talking Couples.

Harry passes a table where a BEATEN SIXTY YEAR OLD dines with

his AGE APPROPRIATE, WELL-FED WIFE. IN SLOW MOTION, Harry and

The Beaten Man catch each other's glance.

I         spinach. I've wondered...

Harry ENTERS all over again. This time he looks older,

something in his walk and the boxy cut of his jacket. With

him is a regular looking, nothing-to-write-home-about WOMAN

IN HER FIFTIES.

INT. CHIC EATERY - HARRY'S IMAGINATION - TAKE TWO

Again, the identical set up. Harry ENTERS again. This time he

looks ten years older. The bounce to his step is gone. The

twinkle in his eye, long dead. On his arm is a 63 YEAR OLD

BATTLE AX, built just like Harry. The Maitre'd reluctantly

shows them to a shitty table.

A LONG STRETCH OF PRISTINE COUNTRY ROAD - THE HAMPTONS - DAY

A Silver Mercedes convertible bursts into FRAME. Harry's

behind the wheel, shades, smoking a cigar, livin' large. Next

to him sits a thoroughbred of a girl. An "IT" Girl. Smart,

sexy and built for fun. She has perfected flirting to an art.

Her hand rests on Harry's neck. There's a good thirty year

age difference between them. Her name is MARIN. She SINGS

along with Ja Rule, now coming from a CD.

Harry looks to Marin, feigning hurt.

Just then the CAR PHONE RINGS. Harry keeps looking at Marin.

Harry waits. RINGGG!

He doesn't look away.

Marin continues singing along with Ja Rule as Harry

confidently slips his hand onto her thigh.

Harry hangs up, doesn't look in Marin's direction to see if'

she caught that. This brand of cool is about not playing that

card. Marin turns toward him, she has been listening. They've

reached the end of the road, sand dunes, long lilting grass

and the ocean stretch before them.

Marin turns up the CD, getting herself out of whatever just

came over her, looks out the window.

Marin laughs, softening, as Harry turns down a dirt driveway,

driving toward a DREAM BEACH HOUSE.

That got her. Harry parks. She looks over at him but he's

grabbing some cigars for his shirt pocket, then looks up at

her with an innocent look that suggests he did not just say

such a lovely thought.

They both grab their H

Marin sets her bag down, walks to Harry, wraps her arms

around his neck.

Marin smiles then kisses him. He's one of those guys that

lets you kiss them.

Marin starts UNBUTTONING HER SWEATER as she dances

seductively toward the front door, then notices Harry's

cigars.

She SLIPS OFF her sweater and DROPS IT ON HARRY'S HEAD.

INT. HOUSE

It's one of those great Beach Houses. Light filled and warm

with spectacular views of the sandy landscape wrapping around

the rear of the house. Marin, now in a tight tank, tight

pants, gives Harry the grand tour as she continues to

undress.

Marin provocatively UNZIPS her pants and wriggles out of

them. She's now in a TINY TANK AND BIKINI PANTIES.

Marin HEARS Harry's ZIPPER UNZIP. She turns, her EYES

WIDENING as Harry's PANTS land on a chair. Harry is now down

to his Boxers, an Open Shirt and a fearless smile.

They arrive in a warmly decorated GUEST BEDROOM.

Harry takes Marin's hand and pulls her OUT OF FRAME and ONTO

THE BED. She playfully rolls on top of him. His hands cup her

ass.

She bounces off him like a kid and disappears into the

bathroom.

Harry lies there alone for a second. Catches his breath. He

sits up, feet on the floor, shoulders hunched, clears his

throat, bangs on his chest. He waits a sec then stands with a

stiffness that for the first time suggests he is not a that

young man.

INT. LIVING ROOM

Now wearing only his Boxer Shorts, Harry crosses through the

Living ROOM, singing 'Livin' It Up' to himself. He reaches into

his bag and lifts out Two Bottles of Crystal. He sees himself in

the mirror, sucks in his gut.

INT. KITCHEN

Well stocked, the best of everything. Harry opens the door to the

fridge and just as HE DISAPPEARS BEHIND IT, the BACK DOOR OPENS

and TWO WOMEN ENTER from a beach walk, in the middle of a lively

conversation.

One of them is ERICA, Marin's Mother. The other is Erica's

Younger Sister, ZOE.

ERICA is in her mid-fifties and is a poster girl for growing old.

It's actually hard to imagine 55 looking any better. And not

because she looks 35, but because she makes 55 look graceful and

right. Erica is the "girl most likely" who went beyond

expectations but didn't realize until recently that being sure of

herself was a handicap. She doesn't try to be intimidating, she

just is.

Her sister, ZOE is in her forties. Zoe's the loose one. She

wears draw string pants and a T-shirt that says, "BOYS LIE".

The Women stop mid-sentence when they notice the REFRIGERATOR

IS WIDE OPEN. Then they SEE A PAIR OF BARE MEN'S LEGS poking

out from UNDER THE DOOR. They don' t move.

Erica nods to Zoe, gesturing a nearby knife. Zoe grabs the knife.

Harry pokes his head out from behind the fridge, equally confused.

With that, Harry SHUTS the fridge door. The Women see he's

naked except for a Pair of Boxers. They both GASP. Zoe

FUMBLES the phone over to Erica who dials quickly..

Zoe can't believe she just said that -- no truth in it

whatsoever.

With that, Marin ENTERS, in a tiny bikini, sees Harry in his

shorts, Zoe holding the knife and Erica frozen, holding the

phone.

All three Women turn to Harry who now dangles a long Lobster

shaped oven mitt over his "privates"...

Marin shoots her Mom a look. Help!

Marin watches. Dying.

The Women all look to Harry. He looks at Marin. She's hard to

resist.

HARRY AND MARIN

Walking past SHOPS on the MAIN DRAG IN EAST HAMPTON. They are

both licking ice cream cones. CAMERA STAYS BEHIND THEM.

ERICA AND ZOE

Are paced 20 feet behind them, carrying groceries.

CLOSE ON A YOUNG FRENCH GIRL IN AN APRON

The Girl stands BEHIND THE CHEESE COUNTER in:

THE BAREFOOT CONTESSA

A Gourmet Market in East Hampton. The clientele in here is as

rich looking as the food. Erica stands on the other side of

the Cheese Counter.

Harry and Marin shop near by. Harry listens to Erica out of

one ear.

Marin crosses to the dessert counter. Erica turns back and

catches Harry checking out Marin's ass. He smiles as he licks

his ice cream. Erica rolls her eyes then spots another Older

Guy with a Leggy Girl twenty-five years his junior.

Then Erica notices who's next to her at the cheese counter.

She sees her Sister, Zoe, reading a cheese label with her

glasses on and next to Zoe are two sad looking Old Women in

their Eighties with their arms linked. Almost woozy, Erica is

snapped out of it when she is handed her package.

Erica heads down the aisle, passing Harry whose back is to

her. Just as she passes, he turns and almost bumps into her.

They so very badly do not want to actually touch. Erica

hesitates. Harry gestures for her to go first then walks

alongside her.

Erica places her groceries on the check out counter.

INT. ERICA'S DINING ROOM - THAT NIGHT

Marin serves plates of pasta with lobster. Zoe pours wine and

Erica tosses a salad. Harry is the only one sitting.

Marin places a plate in front of Harry then runs her finger

along "the nape of his neck. They smile at each other as she

continues on. Erica notices, tries not to respond.

Marin and Zoe stop what they are doing and turn to Erica.

She's hesitant to reveal this.

Zoe and Marin laugh.

Harry leans back, places his arm around Marin's chair. Erica

takes note.

Erica pauses on that one.

You're not serious? She's Diane

Sawyer, she goes into caves in

Afghanistan with a shmahtah on her

head. Who cares about her legs?

Just anyone who's ever had the

pleasure of... You know what? I

hate to eat and run but...

No, wait. This is actually a very

fascinating dynamic - what's going

on at this table...

Z

Columbia. . .

Oh, so this is gonna hurt.

No, come on, listen, here's the rub

for women. Look at what we have

here with you and Erica. Harry,

you've been around the block a few

times, right? You're what? Around

60, never been married, which, we

all know, if you were a woman,

would be a curse, you'd be an old

maid, a spinster, blah, blah,

blah... Okay, so instead of pitying

you, they write articles about you,

celebrate your never marrying, it

makes you illusive and ungettable.

You're a real catch. Then, take my

gorgeous sister here...

Any chance of you stopping here?

Come on, this is interesting. I

mean, look at her, she's so

accomplished, the most successful

woman playwright since who? Lillian

Hellman? She's over fifty,

divorced and still sits in night

after night because the available

guys her age want

Erica and Harry's EYES CONNECT for a millisecond. HEAR THE

SOUND OF PLATES CRASHING.

INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

OVER, we

Erica is cleaning up the broken plates, Zoe leans down to

help.

M          I was married for 20 years. I'm done.

I'm sorry, I thought I was onto

something.

Honey, what are you doing with this

guy? He's old, he's chauvinistic...

He's fun.

He's fun? How is he fun? He's

like.. .wrong.

Wrong can be fun, Mom.

Not this wrong.

Can we not do this now? He's

actually incredibly smart and

fascinating and if you had talked

to him about something other than

his marital status you would've

found out how smart he is. He owns

like 10 different companies...

What does that mean he owns ten

different companies? He can't

commit, that's what that means. Not

that, God forbid, I want him to

commit.

Yeah, that I get. Anyway, he said he

thought you two were very spontaneous and

nice and then said he's leaving as soon

as the sun comes up.

What? His car doesn't have

headlights?

Good night.

Wait. I have no right to get this

nuts.

He's your friend. Not mine. I love

you.

This is obviously a ritual between them. Erica kisses

Marin's cheek in a flutter of kisses, then Marin

EXITS.

They HEAR MUSIC coming from Marin's bedroom.

Erica turns on the garbage disposal. Zoe sings along,

"Let's get it on". .., Erica shoots her a look, turns

off the garbage disposal, doing the dishes with vigor.

Then they hear Marin GIGGLING.

Marin YELPS.

Then they hear Marin SCREAM.

Erica covers her ears with her hands. Then they hear

Marin SCREAM "MOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!"

INT. MARIN'S ROOM - ANGLE - THE DOOR

Erica and Zoe bust into the room and find Harry .on the

floor, leaning against the bed, a clenched fist on his chest.

His shirt is open, he's sweating, his complexion is grey.

Marin stands back, freaked out, afraid to get near him.

Marin hesitates.

HARRY'S POV - THE ROOM

Spinning. When he shuts his eyes, it goes BLACK. Spinning.

BLACK. Spinning. BLACK. He sees Marin, soft in the

background, on the phone and Erica coming toward him. He

hears Zoe:

ON HARRY

Even in this state he gets that Erica is about to place her.

mouth on his. His eyes WIDEN IN HORROR, he reels back. Erica

catches this.

She does it anyway. Her-mouth on his, her breath into his

lungs, over and over. Harry's eyes roll back in hi-so head.

As. Erica pounds on his chest, we HEAR THE BLARE OF A

SIREN...

AND A LOUD CLANG

As the DOORS to SOUTHAMPTON HOSPITAL FLY OPEN. Paramedics

WHEEL Harry through the corridors and into the ER with

dizzying speed. Two Nurses jostle Harry OFF the gurney and

ONTO A BED.

DR. JULIAN MERCER arrives at Harry's side. Julian is in his

early-thirties and has finally just graduated out of the 'you

look too young to be a doctor' syndrome. Julian is a man

whose goodness makes him sexy. He wears his hair shaggier

than you'd expect but then again, this is a Johns Hopkins

graduate who chose to live near the beach and work nights.

The Nurses place oxygen in Harry's nose, .;hook him up to a

heart monitor and connect him to an IV.

The Nurse wheels over an EKG machine, Julian helps hook it

up.

Harry clenches his fist over his sternum.

Erica, Marin and Zoe ARRIVE in the DOORWAY of the ER. Harry

eyes them...stalls.

The Women grab looks at each other, know they shouldn't be

there. They turn away.

CLOSE - HARRY'S EYES - PANICKED

As he watches the NITROGLYCERIN make it's way DOWN THE TUBE

and APPROACH HIS ARM. Just as the amber liquid is about to

enter his bloodstream he YANKS the IV out of his arm. The

drip is knocked onto the ground. The Women shriek as the

Nurses scurry to clean up. Erica and Zoe rush out, Marin

hangs back. Harry catches the look on her face.

THE HALLWAY

Marin paces, smoking. Erica sits. Zoe leans against the wall.

Julian rounds the corner of the corridor. Marin rushes toward

him, her face begging for good news.

His sweet apologetic smile is not lost on Marin. Zoe and

Erica join them.

Marin pats her Mom on the back.

Erica wipes away a tear. Nothing could surprise her more.

Julian says Hi to each then returns his attention fully and

devotedly to Erica. Takes her in.

CLOSE - A JAPANESE TEA POT

Julian pours steaming hot tea into 3 paper cups.

MARIN - CLOSE

Sitting in the hospital corridor as JULIAN'S HAND ENTERS HER

FRAME and hands her a cup of tea. She looks up at him with

more adorableness than most men could handle. She blows on

the steam.

Camera Pans to ZOE. Sitting next to Marin. She is also handed

a Cup of Tea. Even she softens as she looks up at Julian.

This is all beginning to feel a little like the Step Sisters

trying on the Glass Slipper. Until we get to Erica, not

paying any attention at all as she is handed her Tea.

Zoe nudges Erica as a Nurse enters from the ER.

The Women wave and watch him exit.

The second he's gone:

Just then, Harry stumbles into the corridor in his Hospital

Gown, pretty out of it.

Confused, Harry turns around, a little lost, giving the Women

a FULL VIEW OF HIS BARE ASS. The Women muffle screams.

He faces them.

Harry wobbles. Is he going to fall? Marin freezes, looks to

her Mom for help. Erica rushes to Harry.

He falls on Erica, totally out of it, his head on her breast,

his mouth open.

The Nurses rush out and peel Harry off Erica.

Harry turns back to the Women, smiling. He likes that idea.

LOVES that idea.

As he walks away, his bare ass shines like a full moon in a

desert sky.

CLOSE - A LARGE VASE OF YELLOW ROSES - 36 HOURS LATER

A Nurse slides the Roses down the counter of her station.

She looks across at a neat as a pin Man in his early forties,

Prada suit, crisp white shirt, dark tie. He's a Gershwin tune

of a man. A throwback to a kinder world. This is. LOWELL,

Harry's Houseman/Chef/all around Man Friday.

Julian ENTERS the Nurse's station.

Julian EXITS the Nurse's Station. Lowell, carrying the

flowers, follows. He nods to TWO TALL LEGGY MINI SKIRTED

ASSISTANT TYPES, KIM and LEXI who follow. Both pack cell

phones, note pads, carry balloons, flowers and shopping bags.

They arrive at:

A PRIVATE ROOM

where Harry lies on the bed, dressed and ready to go. He

squints as he reads a pamphlet at arms's distance called,

"Heart Attack -- Bouncing Back".

Harry sits up too fast, lies right back down. Lowell looks

like he might cry. The Girls hold back.

Harry stands and indulges Lowell in a deep hug. Lowell's

shoulders shake as he sobs.

Kim hands Harry a shopping bag full of CDs.

Lexi hands Harry another bag. Harry reaches in and pulls out

a small leather box, hands it to Julian.

T

more reserved than normal.

Everyone EXITS leaving Marin and Harry alone. Harry sits on

the bed. Marin joins him. Harry places his hand on her thigh.

All she notices is his hospital bracelet.

Marin smiles, kisses Harry on the cheek.

EXT. SOUTHAMPTON HOSPITAL - DAY

Harry is wheeled out in a wheelchair, Marin and a Nurse on

either side. In the parking lot is a Town Car with Lowell and

the Girls standing next to it. Next to them is Erica, waiting

by her car. She's on her cell phone. Harry spots them and

tries to get out of the wheel chair before it stops.

To prove her wrong, Harry rises quickly. Everyone stands by,

ready to help.

As soon as Harry spots Erica, he starts to wobble.

Everyone grabs for Harry as he FALLS OUT OF FRAME AND THE

SCREEN GOES BLACK.

CLOSE ON JULIAN

taking Harry's pulse as Harry lies on the ASPHALT OF THE

HOSPITAL PARKING LOT. Lowell, the Two Assistants and Marin

huddle around. Erica steps back a bit.

Marin turns to Erica who very clearly mouths, "FORGET IT!"

EXT. ERICA'S HOUSE - LATER THAT DAY.

The Town Car sits in the driveway, Lexi leans on the hood,

talking on her cell. A Market Delivery Van pulls away as a

Drugstore Delivery Van pulls in. A Flower Delivery KID

holding a large bouquet, knocks at the front door.

I

Harry sits up in bed wearing silk pajamas, holding an unlit

cigar, and is on the phone.

Zoe enters, placing the new bouquet on the already flower

filled dresser. Lowell lifts a LUNCH TRAY off the bed as Kim

stands nearby on the cell phone. Marin packs her bag.

Kim hands Harry the cell phone.

Kim hands Harry a NOTE that says:

Harry steals a look at Marin, then nods to Kim.

INT. KITCHEN

Erica puts away groceries, a little on edge. Her back is to a

Man in his fifties, who sits at the island, eating a

sandwich. He wears sweats and a baseball cap. His natural

expression is -- worried. This is DAVE.

Lowell ENTERS with the Bed Tray.

Erica takes the bed tray as Lowell EXITS.

Lexi ENTERS, all 5'10" of her. Dave suddenly looks alive. She

carries an empty water glass.

Erica hands Lexi the Tylenol, she thanks her and EXITS.

Before Erica can respond, Marin ENTERS.

EXT. ERICA'S HOUSE - SUNSET

No cars are out front. Quiet and peaceful. On the Soundtrack

we hear the French tune, I wish You Love sung in French.

INT. ERICA'S KITCHEN - THE SAME TIME - MUSIC OVER

Erica cooks, softly singing along in French.

Surprised, Erica turns to find Harry leaning in the doorway

in his pajamas, robe and slippers. No one's ever had more

gorgeous clothes to sleep in. His presence disarms her.

Harry appreciates the thought. Before it has time to become

awkward, the Phone RINGS.

Erica can't stand this. She puts on her glasses and skims her

recipe.

Harry squints, can't see what he's writing...backs his head

away from the pad. Erica hands him her glasses.

Harry hangs up and hands the glasses back to Erica.

Harry hands her the open wine bottle.

EXT. BEACH PATIO

WIDE SHOT - ALMOST NIGHT

Erica and Harry sit not so close together at a long table,

under a purple sky. Another French Tune plays. If this wasn't

them, this would look romantic.

N

shaker, about to add salt to his chicken.

Harry shoots her a look and places the salt shaker back on the

table.

EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT - OVER - LOUIS ARMSTRONG'S LA VIE EN ROSE

A starry sky gives the house a storybook setting. We HEAR THE

PHONE RING.

INT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME - MUSIC CONTINUES

Erica works at a laptop at a cluttered table. The CLOCK tells us

it's a little after ONE A.M. Annoyed by the ringing phone, she

points her remote at the CD Player and stops' the song. Harry

answers the phone in his room. A moment of quiet. Erica points her

remote, starts the song again, starts typing again. Now the other

line RINGS. She looks over at the phone watching one RED LIGHT

"BLINK, while the other line is answered.

She throws a piece of paper over the phone so she can't see it.

She clicks on her AOL ICON and is told: AOL CANNOT CONNECT. LINE

BUSY. She's pissed. Then, worse, she SMELLS something.

INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

Harry is on the phone, smoking a cigar. His pajama top is

unbuttoned, his hair is allover the place. His bed is a mess,

laptop open, newspapers spilling onto the floor. Erica stands

in the doorway. He quickly hides his cigar.

Erica holds out a partially filled water glass for Harry to

deposit his cigar in.

She waits. She doesn't say anything.

She shakes the water glass, waiting for the deposit. He drops

the cigar in.

Erica rolls her eyes as she finishes cleaning up.

INT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Almost TWO. Erica is writing, her eyes go to the phone with

the typing paper over it. She LIFTS a corner of the paper,

takes a peek. The one lit line GOES OUT. Finally. "Erica

turns off her computer, sits for a second. No one has rattled

her cage like this in quite some time. And no, she doesn't

like it. She stands, starts to undress.

ANGLE - THE FLOOR

As Erica's TURTLENECK lands on it. Then her BRA, then her

PANTS then her PANTIES.

ERICA - NAKED - TIGHT SHOT

She crosses through the room on her way to the Bathroom. She

passes by her partially open door, happens to look out INTO

THE HALLWAY AND SEES:

HARRY - PLANTED RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER

Seeing it all.

ERICA - SCREAMS

and DROPS OUT OF FRAME.

HARRY

flustered, spins around, loses his balance, crashes into the

wall, covers his eyes.

Erica SLAMS HER DOOR. Photos on the wall shake.

INT. LIVING ROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

A very wide MIDDLE AGED NURSE gruffly crosses thru the room

toward the Front Door. Just as she opens the door, Erica

ENTERS in hat, sunglasses, turtleneck, long skirt. Pretty

much no skin is showing whatsoever. She carries a few

packages.

Erica hardly looks at You Know Who who appears to be fresh

out of the shower, wet hair, silk robe, bare chest and legs.

Harry hands her a wad of bills like she's a Maitre'd. Mrs.

Gimble gives Erica a look of pity as she exits. Erica, now

alone with Harry, self-consciously adjusts her sunglasses.

Harry, on the other hand, slips his hand onto his bare chest,

pats it.

The Sound of a DOOR SLAM. - Harry flinches.

INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM

Harry and Julian sit on the bed. Julian takes Harry's blood

pressure.

Julian takes Harry's pulse.

A LOW ANGLE OF A STAIRCASE

Which goes from the beach up to Erica's deck. Harry stands at

the bottom of the stairs in his robe, velvet slippers and

sunglasses.' He looks up to the top of the stairs as if it's

Mt. Everest. Bravely, he climbs the first few steps. Not bad.

After two more, he's out of breath. Determined, he holds onto

the railing and drags himself up to the next step. Happy with

himself, he holds on for dear life and drags himself up one

more...and then, he's so out of breath, he can barely move,

yet he reaches up the railing and tries to hike himself up

one more.

INT . KITCHEN - SAME TIME

The tea kettle WHISTLES as Erica and Julian stand on either

side of her island. Erica reaches for a tea bag.

The Phone RINGS.

ANGLE - JULIAN

Smitten. Just something about her. Watching her.

ANGLE - ERICA

Not noticing, pouring water for her tea.

Erica sees Julian sliding a slip of paper over to her. Looks

over at it. It's a piece of paper from his prescription pad.

On it is written...Have dinner with me tonight? Erica looks

up at him. Stunned. J

We begin to hear strains of another French song.

INT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON - MUSIC OVER

Erica at her desk, typing. The Music plays from the CD

player. As much as she doesn't want it to be true, this

attention from Julian has fueled her.

THE LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME - MUSIC OVER

Harry, dressed for the first time, wearing khaki's and a

summer shirt, strolls through the Living Room a bit cautious.

ERICA Laughs. Even she knows this is funny. Harry arrives at

her open doorway, timidly pokes his head in.

Harry ENTERS cautiously and curiously.

EXT. BEACH - MOMENTS LATER - LATE .IN THE DAY

Erica and Harry walk by the water's edge. They are the only

two people on the beach.

Erica bends down and picks up A FLAT WHITE STONE, then

another and another...

Erica is stunned that he caught on to that. Harry bends down,

picks up a BROWN stone, places it in her palm among the white

stones.

Erica realizes she can't sum this guy up so easily or at all.

There he goes again. She can't believe he's cute like this.

T

up, daunted.

Erica checks her watch.

Over, we HEAR, DING DONG.

THAT NIGHT - THE FRONT DOOR - SWINGS OPEN

And we find Julian. Looking just as any girl would hope.

Dream Date.

AND ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR

is Harry, in his robe and PJ's.

Julian hands him a take-out food box.

Both guys turn at once. She looks beautiful, wearing a dress,

probably the sexiest one she owns. No turtleneck tonight.

Julian walks to her, kisses her on the cheek.

Behind Julian's back Harry gives Erica the 'OK' sign.

ANGLE - HARRY

sitting, self-conscious in his new role - The Sick One.

Julian takes his wrist, feels his pulse. Harry looks straight

ahead.

WHAT HE SEES - ERICA'S LEGS

as she sits right in front of him. She crosses her legs and

her dress hikes up a little, exposing her thigh.

JULIAN furrows his brow.

Harry LOOKS AT ERICA'S LEGS again.

Erica shifts, the hem of her skirt RISING even higher.

Erica rises, leaving Harry's eye-line.

Harry winces then rises, looks to Erica as she throws a

pashmina over her shoulders in SLOW MOTION. Harry rushes them

OUT THE DOOR.

On Erica's shocked expression, the DOOR SLAMS.

INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT - A BEN WEBSTER CD PLAYS

Harry lies on the sofa. CAMERA MOVES UP Harry's body, past

the hospital take out carton on his stomach and finally up to

his face. As the CAMERA moves we HEAR:

He hangs up, dials another number.

Harry hangs up then slowly sits up, letting himself feel as

funky as he wants.

Harry rises dizzily, crosses to the bookshelves. He rummages

around, finds ERICA'S SCRAPBOOK, pulls it out, randomly opens

it, finds a photo of Erica in the 70's, wearing a turtleneck.

Harry smiles.

INT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Harry wanders in with the scrapbook tucked under his arm. He

notices a bowl filled with white beach stones. Harry's brown

stone sits at the top of the pile.

CLOSE ON JULIAN

Staring at Erica. He can't get enough of her. They're in a

ROMANTIC SEASIDE RESTAURANT. And Erica's blushing for the

first time in twenty-five years.

Thirty-three.-Okay, so, I'm twenty years

older than you. More than twenty years

older than you.

You look fabulous.

Thank you   but you know, I'm not sure

where you   were headed with that thing you

were just   saying, but in terms of us, you

just want   to be friends, right?

Honestly? No.

Well, then, what is it that you...

want to be?

I think I'd embarrass you if I told

you.

I was embarrassed just getting

dressed to see you.

This may surprise you but some

women consider me quite the guy.

I've never been married. I'm a

doctor. You wouldn't believe what

catnip that is for some women.

Oh yes I would. But, you don't like

girls your own age?

I do very much. But I've never met one

I've taken to quite like this and when

something happens to you that's never

happened to you before, don't you have to

at least find out what it is?

I suppose but, see, I don't date

all that much or all that well...

Oh, come on, you must beat them

away with a stick.

Ow. Right to the middle of her shoulder, then her neck.

Julian kisses her palm, then her.

MEANWHILE, HARRY IS SOUND ASLEEP ON ERICA'S BED

Her scrapbook open against his chest. We HEAR the SOUND OF

ACAR pulling up to the house. Harry wakes up. Oh shit.   He

leaps out of bed, this is the fastest he's moved in days. A

bit disoriented, he straightens the covers, looks around for

other evidence then hightails it out of there.

INT. LIVING ROOM - A MOMENT LATER

Erica enters, letting out a huge sigh. She's brought back to

reality when she hears the TV in Harry's room. She heads his

way, then changes her mind and stops.

INT. HARRY'S ROOM - SAME TIME

Harry's in bed, clearly disappointed that she didn't stop in.

INT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - LATER

Erica, in pj's and glasses, sits at her laptop, writing. She

hears the CHIME of someone INSTANT MESSENGERING HER. It a

message from HARRYL37. It says: What R U doing?

W

She answers: Writing. Hi. What R U doing?

He writes: Watching Joan Rivers sell jewelry.

Erica laughs when he adds: So was your date a date?

She types: I think so...

He types: I told ya. (then) You hungry?

Surprised, she types: I just had dinner.

He writes: Yeah, but women never eat on dates.

She hesitates then types: Actually am a little hungry but,

I'm in my pjs.

He writes: Me too. Pajama party?

SHE stares at the screen biting her lip. HE does the same.

Erica rises, LOOKS IN THE MIRROR, checks out her boobs in her

pajamas. They look so low. She opens a drawer, rifles through it,

takes out a bra, takes out a better bra.

IN HIS BATHROOM, Harry fixes his hair, tries to make more of it

than he has.

Erica now wearing a bra under he pajamas, checks out her boobs

again. Better. She adjusts the straps. Lifts them higher.

INT. LIVING ROOM

Erica and Harry ENTER FROM OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE ROOM, both in

their pajamas.

She looks through the fridge.

She starts mixing the batter.

The moment is broken when they HEAR the FRONT DOOR OPEN and

HIGH HEELS APPROACHING.

Marin ARRIVES IN THE DOORWAY in a knockout of a dress holding

a bag from Zabars. She looks fresh, vibrant, sexy.

Erica and Harry have the air of kids caught making out by one

of their parents. Harry straightens out his pajamas, smooths

down his hair. Erica catches all this.

Erica nods to herself. Oh, God, he sends them all flowers.

Harry notes Erica's reaction.

Marin's cell phone RINGS.

Erica feeling suddenly frumpy, fixes her hair. Harry watches

her. She catches him and shrugs. Marin flips her phone shut

and tosses it in her purse.

She pours a healthy Vodka into a glass, grabs some ice.

Just as harry is about to answer, Marin's cell RINGS. She

picks it up, looks at her caller ID, throws it back in her

bag.

Marin watches her mother EXIT then looks to Harry, his eyes

following her Mom out the door. She's sees a look on Harry's

face she never remotely saw when he looked at her. At first

she's shocked. He likes my mother??? Then a flash of

jealousy. He likes my mother!?! Then pure joy - realizing how

perfect it is.

INT. BRIDGEHAMPTON GENERAL STORE - DAY

Erica, back in a turtleneck, picks peaches out of a basket.

Marin ENTERS HER FRAME, baseball cap, sunglasses, picking

cherries.

INT. ERICA'S KITCHEN

Erica looks out her KITCHEN WINDOW and SEES Marin and Harry

TALKING ON THE BEACH. She leans so far to see them, she's

about to lose her balance. The Phone RINGS, she reaches for

it and slips right Out Of Frame.

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

Julian, in his scrubs, walks quickly down a hallway of the

ER, on his CELL PHONE.

Julian stops short.

I

Erica smiles to herself.

ON JULIAN - AS HE LEANS AGAINST A WALL

turning off the phone and grabbing his heart

Marin ENTERS through the kitchen door, looking almost a

little dazed.

Marin EXITS and the PHONE RINGS.

Harry and Erica talk while looking at each other through the

Kitchen Window.

THE BEACH - MUSIC OVER

Erica and Harry sit on a blanket on a cloudy day having a

picnic lunch. Harry is telling Erica a story and she screams

with laughter.

BROWN STONES IN THE SAND - MUSIC CONTINUES

Erica picks them up as.she walks with Harry by the water's

edge. They talk non-stop.

A LITTLE LATER - LIGHTNING STREAKS THE SKY

Out of nowhere, a downpour. Erica and Harry gather their

picnic things. The blanket starts to fly and Harry grabs it

as Erica runs after a plate spinning away in the wind.

INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Erica and Harry, wet from the rain, quickly shut all the

doors and windows. Lightning crackles across the sky and THE

LIGHTS IN THE HOUSE GO OUT.

A MATCH IS STRUCK

and a CANDLE is lit. Then ANOTHER ONE, and ANOTHER ONE. Erica

turns and finds Harry just looking at her. Before either of

them has time to think, they kiss.

Relieyed, Erica kisses him.

He kisses her again and again.

I haven't used them for kissing in so long. They've been more

like for wearing lipstick and whistling and...

He kisses her quiet. Relieved, she finally fully kisses him

back. A big gorgeo~s kiss.

something that works...

They both look down at Harry. Hello, Mr. Midnight.

S

ERICA'S BED

They're kissing on it. The rain pelts against the windows as

the sun goes down.

He tries to kiss her neck but the turtleneck is in the way.

He pulls it down, but it's tight and it's, difficult to get

to her.

He tries lifting the shirt from the bottom, it's awkward, he

doesn't want to be down there yet. He comes back up when

Erica reaches to her night table, slides opens the drawer,

takes out a SCISSORS and hands it to him.

What a brilliant invitation. He takes the scissors and starts

cutting from the bottom, right past her belly, up her torso,

between her breasts. The turtleneck falls open from the

center. When he reaches her neck, he gently tears at it and

it easily rips apart and there she is. He takes her in.

She shakes her head, 'no' ...shuts her eyes.

They kiss and she reaches down for his pants.

He kisses between her breasts, her stomach, heads down and

OUT OF FRAME. Erica can't quite believe life held this twist

for her. Then:,

His head POPS BACK INTO FRAME. What?????

H

sprawled out on the bed. Erica straddles him and whips the

blood pressure cuff on his arm and pumps it hard. Like a warm

Jewish Mother of a Dominatrix. He looks up at her, shaking

his head...

Erica grabs Harry's glasses, reads the results.

THE BLOOD PRESSURE CUFF - IN SLOW MOTION

hurdles recklessly into the air.

EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT - LATER

The rain is coming down in torrents.

INSIDE

We are CLOSE ON ERICA'S FACE - UPSIDE DOWN, hanging off the

side of the bed. She's sweaty, flushed, overwhelmed...

CAMERA TWIRLS AROUND and we FIND HARRY, sprawled nearby,

catching his breath, satisfied, stunned, scared.

Erica arrives next to him, also out of breath.

Harry smiles. He's trying to be his debonair self but

something's off. He's very aware of himself. They lie there

quietly for a second when Erica begins to tear up. Harry

slowly, nervously turns to her.

Flattered, Erica snuggles up close. Harry puts his arm around

her. Then, with no warning, his eyes fill with tears.

Erica pauses. Oh. That kind of overwhelmed.

Good sport Erica gives him a double thumbs up.

Harry holds her close.

He looks at her wondering if she's for real. She smiles as

she wipes a small tear from the corner of her eye. Then he

kisses her.

LATER - THEY'RE HUDDLED UNDER THE COVERS

C

LATER - THEY'RE LYING ON A CHAISE

in Erica's room, making out. A Cell Phone RINGS. They both

look around for it. Erica reaches for it on her desk.

INTERCUT WITH MARIN IN A TAXI IN THE CITY - IT'S POURING

Marin SCREAMMMMMMMMMMMS. Erica flips the phone shut, looks to

Harry, embarassed.

Erica buries her face in his chest.

LATER

Harry and Erica SIT ON STOOLS AT THE KITCHEN ISLAND, drinking

wine and eating scrambled eggs right out of the pan. Candles

light the room.

She kisses him, starts to say, "I'm sorry" when he pulls her

back, kisses her again, then looks at her hard, perplexed.

CLIMBING BACK UNDER THE COVERS

She gets out of bed.

She has no idea how to take that. Decides to accept it.

She turns, sees he's getting out of bed, approaching her.

Erica nods. She knows.

HARRY FLOPS ONTO HIS BED

stares straight up at the ceiling.

INT. ERICA'S ROOM - SAME TIME

Erica gets back in her bed. She lies there for a

second,securing her armor back in place. She routinely moves

to the middle of the bed,neatens out the covers and shuts her

eyes. Then a small KNOCK on her open door. She sees Harry in

the doorway.

I

Erica hesitates, then moves to one side of the bed and as

Harry climbs in next to her we:

EXT. HOUSE - THE FOLLOWING MORNING

The place is a mess, the aftermath of the storm.

HNT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - THE SAME TIME

snuggly around her. The ELECTRICITY POPS BAGK ON and the room

is suddenly lit up and one of Erica's French CDs comes on

full blast.

Harry opens his eyes. He's surprised to see he has his arm

around her. Erica awakens just as surprised. In the light of

day, a definite hint of embarrassment ...

They turn and finally look at each other. Both look wrinkled,

messy haired, a little wiped.

Erica smiles, then walks away with the achey walk of a woman

who hasn't had sex in many a year but has more than made up

for it in the last 12 hours. She holds onto the wall as she

exits the room, a little bow-legged, like she's just gotten

off a horse. Alone in the hallway, she stops.

AN EKG MACHINE

Spits out a long tape. TILT UP to Julian at the end of the

tape. Harry sits on an examining table in JULIAN'S OFFICE,

buttoning up his shirt.

Harry stands, tucks in his shirt, smiling proudly to himself.

Julian, suddenly riveted to these words.

A real moment between them. Julian decides to take the high

road.

Julian shakes Harry's hand. Harry's eyes TEAR UP.

ERICA - TYPING - HER PHONE RINGS

She wears a blouse with more buttons unbuttoned than ever in

her life. She picks up the phone.

HARRY DRIVES ERICA'S CAR, TOP DOWN.

A CROWDED CLUB - SOUTHAMPTON - THAT NIGHT

Packed with Young People. In the middle of this twentysomething

sun burnt beach crowd, we find, Erica and Harry, the two coolest

people in the room, dancing with each other.

A LITTLE 'LATER - THE KARAOKE ROOM

Harry leads Erica through a crowd listening to a Girl singing

Britney Spears' Oops, I Did It Again. When she finishes the

crowd enthusiastically applauds.

Harry makes his way TO THE STAGE, hands them his disc. He's

handed a microphone. He looks right at Erica.

The Music begins and it is an instrumental version of one of

Erica's French Songs, "I Wish You Love".

H         you love...

Now Harry sings the rest of the song IN FRENCH. . .

-.

And so on... Erica watches knowing something in her life has

just that second, forever changed. And as Harry continues

singing, we:

LOWELL - THE NEXT DAY

Packing the Trunk of the Town Car in front of Erica's house.

INT. HARRY'S ROOM - SAME TIME

Harry tosses his pills in a leather bag. .. Erica enters

doing the worst job she's ever done of being strong.

From behind her back Erica pulls out a Mason Jar filled with

all dark beach stones with ONE WHITE STONE in the center.

Harry hugs her. Erica awkwardly throws her arms around him

and kisses him, then kisses him better. He's moved by her.

Harry expression looks something like he's in pain. Then. . .

INT. CAR - MOVING AWAY FROM THE HOUSE - DAY

Lowell drives, rattling on about all the people who have been

calling about him. Harry, in the backseat, looks back at the

house, until it is finally out of view.

Harry then looks inside the bag with the sandwich and finds an

Envelope from Erica, pulls it out, doesn't open it, places it back

in the bag then takes out his cell phone and dials.

INT. ERICA'S LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME - OVER, THE PHONE RINGS

The room is empty. Erica rushes in, picks up the phone.

MARIN - WALKING IN SOHO

on her cell phone, CRYING.

INTERCUT

AN UPPER EAST SIDE STREET - A LITTLE LATER

One of those gorgeous tree lined streets from a Woody Allen

movie that makes New York seem quaint. Harry's Town Car

pulls up in front of a GORGEOUS   PRISTINE TOWNHOUSE. Harry

steps out in shades, holding an   unlit cigar. Lowell joins him

as the Front Door opens and out   pours his Two Leggy

Assistants and thumping Hip Hop   Music.

LOWELL Good to be back?

HARRY Let's find out.

EXT. ERICA'S HOUSE - LATER

Camera quickly TRACKS Erica down the front path and to her

car. She's on her cell.

EXT. SOTHEBY'S AUCTION HOUSE - THAT NIGHT

A Crowd files in for tonight's auction.

INT. BACKSTAGE DRESSING ROOM - SAME TIME

A tearful Marin is changing from jeans and a T-shirt to a

proper dress and heels. Erica leans on a table, listening.

A KNOCK on the door.

Erica pauses, thinks M

INT. SOTHEBY' S - MOMENTS LATER

Marin, now all pulled together, stands at the podium in front

of a packed house. If' you didn't know, you'd never guess.

ON ERICA

in the back of the room, watching with pride and worry. She

slips out her cell, checks her messages. Her phone lights up

and tells her she has "0" Voice Mail.

A CLOCK ON THE WALL - IT'S 8:30

We are in ERICA'S EMPTY KITCHEN in The Hamptons and her phone

is RINGING.

ANGLE - A CELL PHONE

as A Man's HAND turns it off. We are:

INT. HAMPTON'S RESTAURANT

Julian sits at a table, by himself, in a coat and tie,

tucking away his phone. The Waiter sympathetically approaches

the table.

Julian takes a look at the menu, then looks away.

TWO DINNER PLATES ARE CARRIED THROUGH THE RESTAURANT

and as the CAMERA WIDENS we realize we are:

IN A CHIC CAFE IN MANHATTAN - LATER THAT NIGHT

Camera takes us to Erica, Marin, Dave and DAVE'S FIANCE, KRISTEN,

a combo of a hot tie and a young professional. Everyone has menus

and drinks. A Waiter delivers two new Martinis for Marin and

Erica. They both go right for them. Erica drinks too much too

fast.                D

Marin takes out a pack of cigarettes.

Okay, I'll just..have one.

So, this isn't going badly so far

is it? I mean for a totally surreal

situation like this.

Shall we order?

Absolutely.

Erica, do I like duck?

Yes. It's rabbit you hate.

I'll give you a list of everything

he likes and dislikes.

Let's let her figure some things

out on her own.

I didn't mean those things, Dave.

She did go to medical school.

Hey, not in front of the kids.

I will tell you this...Dave has one

truly great love in his life.

Really? What's that?

His balls.

Okay, I forgot to mention she can't

drink hard liquor.

Why did you order her a Martini?

Erica looks up and sees something that takes her breath away.

A COUPLE ZIGZAGGING AROUND TABLES

and headed in her direction. A sexy Young Thing followed by

her date -- no other than Harry. Harry stops to shake

someone's hand, holds his date around the waist. Suddenly,

the SOUND DROPS OUT of the restaurant as Harry and his Date

walk right by Erica's table in SLOW MOTION, not noticing her.

M

as the room comes alive again. Her eyes follow Harry as he is

seated only one table away, his back to Erica, his Date

facing her. Marin hasn't seen him. Erica tries her hardest to

act normal but apparently isn't.

Erica looks at her menu then her eyes go right back to Harry.

His Date is laughing at something Harry is saying. Harry

leans in to her, whispers something to her. She touches his

hand.

Erica rises; grabs her purse, almost bumps into a Waiter as

she passes Harry's table, knocks into someone's chair, a

glass breaks. Everyone turns to her, including Harry. She now

stands right at his table. He smiles up at her.

EXT. RESTAURANT

Erica rushes out. She's a little high and her heart is

pounding. She heads down the street.

She picks up her pace, starts running. Her cell phone RINGS.

Intercut Harry and Erica on their cells, a block apart.

She considers it.

Erica reaches a corner, can't get across, turns the corner.

Harry ARRIVES NEXT TO HER.

Harry swoons and not in a good way.

D

I'm like the dumb girl who doesn't get it.

I've never been the dumb girl

before. It ain't so great.

Let's just calm down. This was just

a a meal with a friend.

-- Did you know I called you seven

hours ago?

I was gonna call you. I've been jamming

all day, it's my first day back.

Uh-huh. . .

I had these plans before I met you. But I

do like seeing you. I do. I'm always

surprised by it.

What was I thinking?

Maybe you weren't thinking for once and

look what a good time we had. Let's not

ruin something great.

Harry, I won't be good at this.

At what?

Acting like I don't care.

I have never lied to you. I have always

told you some version of the truth.

The truth doesn't have versions.

Can you cut me a little slack? My

life's been turned upside down.

Yeah. Mine too.

Then let's each get our bearings.

I don't want my bearings. I've had my

bearings my whole fucking life. I felt

something with you that... Oh, you don't

want to-

Yes I do.

Tell me.

I felt something with you, I didn't know

really existed. You know what that's like

after a twenty year marriage? To feel

something for another person that's so

off the charts, that -

Okay, not your problem. This is why

I'm not good in relationships. You

know writers are like teachers,

those who can - do, those who can't

- write romantic comedies where

THIS does not happen in the third

act...and it certainly does not

happen to a 55 year old woman. In

the play I'll be 36 so it won't be

as pathetic. I'm just too old to

feel crushed.I've written this

feeling but I never really got it.

You know what this is?

This is heart broken. How's that

for impervious?

You're killin' me.

I just wish it had lasted more than a

week.

Me too.

A TAXI pulls up.

Erica opens the back door of the Taxi.

Erica turns.

This is his chance.

They're both out of words.

She nods. He doesn't give. She ducks into the CAB and it

PULLS AWAY. Harry stands on the street, watching her go.

He grabs his heart.

HARRY - ON A GURNEY

wheeled through the Emergency Room of Beth Israel Hospital.

This is not the Hamptons. This place is crawling with

patients. Harry's delivered to a Latina Doctor in her

thirties, DR. MARTINEZ. As he's taken off the gurney, he's

immediately hooked up to a heart monitor, given oxygen and an

IV.

INT. HARRY'S TOWNHOUSE - LATER

Harry slowly climbs up the gorgeous staircase of his

Townhouse. Exhausted, he stops half way up, sits on a step,

takes out his cell.

He pulls his glasses out of his pocket, puts them on to dial.

Something feels odd, he takes off his glasses, looks at them,

they're not his -- they're Erica's. He puts them back on and

dials.

He realizes he doesn't know what to say, hangs up, then looks

at her glasses.

BLACK SCREEN

A LIGHT POPS ON and Erica ENTERS HER BEDROOM, crying. She

flops down on her bed, picks up her phone, grabs her glasses,

puts them on, doesn't realize they're Harry's. She dials.

Voice Mail tells her she has One Message. She sits up,

excited.             J

Erica hangs up, starts crying again. She takes off her

glasses to wipe her eyes when she realizes she's holding

Harry's glasses. Just the sight of them makes her burst into

tears, the kind of tears that have been thirty years in the

making.

ERICA'S COMPUTER KEYBOARD - NIGHT

A tear lands on it. Erica, back in a turtleneck and wearing

Harry's glasses, starts writing at a breakneck pace, all the

while, tears flood her eyes.

MORNING - WAVES BREAKING ON THE SHORE

ERICA

wakes up. As soon as her eyes open, she bursts into tears.

While in the SHOWER, the crying never stops. While she EATS

BREAKFAST, a downpour. Running ON THE BEACH, she's wailing.

Back at the "COMPUTER, she's sobbing as her hands fly over

the keys. An actual boo hoo can be heard.

At NIGHT, laptop in bed, Erica writes, eating a   bagel, wearing

Harry's glasses and a pair of wrinkled pajamas,   FRENCH MUSIC plays

in the BG. At this point, she doesn't eVen" pay   attention to her

tears, just wipes and types when out of nowhere   she receives an

INSTANT MESSAGE from HARRY.

He writes: Do I hear French Music?

Shocked, she sits up, tries to fix her hair.

H

INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

Harry sits up in bed, staring at his laptop, wearing Erica's

glasses, a pair of pajamas and a three day growth. A

thermometer is propped in his mouth.

He writes: R U there?

She answers: Yes. Hello.

He writes: How are ya?

She writes: Great... as, she wipes her tears on her sleeve.

She answers: Pouring out of me now. Go figure.

E

He types: I miss y .. He stops, thinks before sending.

Then, on his side, he receives: Actually just running out.

Take care...

Harry deletes the I miss y... and instead writes: U 2.

Erica slides down in her bed, wiped.

INT. HARRY' S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

Harry takes out his thermometer. Feels lost. Looks at the

clock. It's 10:00 p.m.

INT. LOWELL'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

Lowell lies in bed in pj's, WATCHING TV, smoking. Harry

arrives at his doorway in his pajamas. Lowell puts out his

cigarette, fans the smoke.

CLOSE - LUCY AND ETHEL ON TV

REVERSE - HARRY AND LOWELL

lying on top of the covers in Lowell's room, both eating

bowls of pasta, watching TV.

Harry nods off and Lowell TURNS OUT THE LIGHT.

EXT. BEACH - THE HAMPTONS - MORNING - MUSIC OVER

Erica and Zoe are taking a walk. Erica, still crying, picks

up a brown stone, explains its meaning to Zoe. Zoe holds the

stone, makes an `awwww' face.Erica nods, then Zoe tosses the

stone in the ocean, fed up with hearing about him already.

Then, Zoe stops Erica, points to something.

MARIN AND HER NEW BOYFRIEND

frolicking on the beach. He's a YOUNG HUNK in a tank top,

shorts, highlighted hair. Erica rolls her eyes.

EXT. BEACH STAIRS - DUSK

Marin rushes down the stairs. Erica sits near the bottom of

the stairs, watching the sunset.

Erica turns, wiping tears.

Are you crying?

I didn't know you did that.

Yeah, it's my new thing. I've

gotten abnormally great at it.

Is it Harry?

Seems I gotta learn how to do that

love 'em and leave 'em stuff.

Fucking men. You don't care when I

say fuck, do you?

Not really. Sometimes. Not right

now.

So now you get my theory about

love? You gotta self protect. It's

too dangerous.

Marin, that theory... how can I put

this so your feelings won't get

hurt. It's just so crazy, it makes

me want to SCREAMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!

And how would you put it if you

wanted to hurt my feelings?

Listen to me... you cannot hide

from love for the rest of your life

because maybe it won't work out and

maybe you'll become unglued. That's

not a way to live.

So you're telling me you're happy

right now? This is good what

happened to you?

Marin's eyes fill up.

INT. HARRY'S HOUSE - NYC - NIGHT

A PARTY is in progress. It's loud. The place is crawling with

characters from the Hip Hop world. Harry winds his way down his

crowded STAIRCASE, Girls grabbing at him as he passes by. As hard

as he tries, he can't quite bring to life the guy he knew how to

be.

Harry makes his way down the stairs, through the crowded

entry and OUT THE FRONT DOOR. OUTSIDE, Harry steps into the

QUIET STREET, looks up at his house and the party inside.

EXT. ROADSIDE FARM STAND - EAST HAMPTON - DAY

Zoe is picking corn, when she notices Julian across the way.

He glances up, looks right past her, obviously doesn't

remember her, keeps on shopping. Zoe thinks for a see,

wondering how she can get his attention when he looks right

back at her, his face full of hope.

INT. ERICA'S DINING ROOM - LATER

Erica sets the table for two. Zoe pokes her head in the door.

J

Zoe fully opens the door revealing Julian holding a bouquet

of fresh cut flowers.

INT. DINING ROOM - LATER - MUSIC OVER

Candlelit. Zoe, Erica and Julian share a bottle of wine and a

home cooked meal. The CAMERA does a 360 around the table,

their faces saying it all. The Women bask in Julian's warmth

as he entertains them with stories. Zoe looks from Julian to

Erica, relieved to see her sister smiling again.

INT. KITCHEN - LATER

Erica places coffee cups in the sink. Julian is next to her,

leaning against the counter, holding a glass of wine.

Erica hesitates then gives him a peck of a kiss.

Erica nods as Julian takes her in his arms and gives her a

kiss that doesn't quit.

Erica very distinctly begins to hear the BEATING of her own

heart.

ERICA'S COMPUTER SCREEN - ANOTHER NIGHT

On it is written: The lights on the Eiffel Tower dim to black

as the music continues to play.

Erica sits back, still wearing Harry's glasses. Finished at

last. She notices an empty Kleenex box on her desk. She

tosses it in a hook shot across the room and it lands right

in the trash can.

INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Julian sits on the sofa, shoes off, reading the first half of

the play. A fire burns in the fireplace. Erica approaches the

back of the sofa, holding the rest of the pages.

Erica leans oyer the sofa, reading over his shoulder.

Erica gives him a small kiss of appreciation.

She leans into him and he kisses her fully and sweetly. She

holds onto the sofa for support.

A PRETTY GIRL - WHO LOOKS A LOT LIKE MARIN

eating lunch in Orso's, talking non-stop.

REVERSE ON HARRY

choking on his lunch.

INT. BROADWAY THEATER - DAY

Auditions are in progress. On stage, AN ACTRESS reads for the

part of "The Sister".

ON ERICA'S PROFILE

in the audience. She sits in a row by herself, listening.

Harry ENTERS HER FRAME, sitting directly behind her.

Erica freezes, horrified. Turns, sees him.

BACKSTAGE

Erica and Harry stand in front of a BACKDROP OF THE BEACH.

Erica nods, horrified.

We now HEAR Louis Armstrong's La Vie En Rose play throughout

the theater. The BEACH backing is 'raised and an EIFFEL TOWER

BACKING is lowered behind them. They both try to ignore the

music, but it's impossible.

As they stand in front of the Eiffel Tower backing, FAKE SNOW

FALLS from above...

I'm friends with my ex-husband, but then

again, we didn't just have sex.

We didn't just have sex either.

Then what was it? Love to know.

Can I e-mail it to you when I figure it

out?

This is perfect. I have given the `Can't

We Be friends' speech for 40 years. I

think I invented the 'Can't We Be

Friends' speech. But you know what,now I

get why they never went for it. You dames

got one thing right. Sometimes sex does

change everything. Call me crazy, but I

just don't see us out on the town, being

pals, having dinner, 'cause I'd bet you

anything, at some point, one of us will

have very unfriend like thoughts about

the other then pass the bread becomes

anything but pass the bread. You get what

I'm saying?

You don't want to be friends.

Not "don't". Can't. Can't be friends.

Doesn't work that way.

Okay, I'm moving into another phase of

this thing. I'm mad at you.

It almost feels good.

I think I'm mad at you too.

Excellent. 'Cause I don't like

thinking about you so much and

worrying about how you are and if I

ruined your life or...

-- You've worried about me?

Yes honey, the schmuck who deserves to

die, worries about you.

Again, The Stage Manager...

Harry and Erica TURN and SEE a CHORUS LINE of BALDING 60 YEAR

OLD MEN IN HOSPITAL GOWNS AND SOCKS.

EXT. THEATER - DAY

Harry FLIES OUT the Stage Door, right into the street, is

almost hit by a motorcycle, doesn't seem to care.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

Harry walks briskly through the park, still pissed, his pace

starting to get to him. He spots a bench with a WOMAN JOGGER

at one end. He parks himself at the other end of the bench,

out of breath. Tries H reason with himself.

Surprised, Harry turns, glances over at the Woman. She drinks

from a water bottle then offers him an easy warm smile. She's

adorable, mid-sixties, short grey hair.

Harry now fully turns in her direction, totally clueless.

He looks at her hard but still doesn't remember her.

OVER Harry's face, we HEAR the SOUND of a SIREN BLARING.

INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

Harry is wheeled through the ER with the gurney. Dr. Martinez

runs along with the gurney.

CLOSE - THE PAPER TAPE FROM HARRY'S EKG

Dr. Martinez reads it.

We hear the SOUND OF LAPPING WATER, SEA GULLS. . . .

And as Harry keeps listing things, Camera MOVES IN ON HIM as

the STEEL BAND gets LOUDER AND LOUDER.

THE WORDS. . .

FALLING SNOW FILLS THE FRAME

Boom down to see the THEATER MARQUEE of Erica's play on

Broadway. On the Marquee are raves from critics, "****", and

a banner that brags, "Sold Out!".

C

bundled up against the cold. Harry ENTERS FRAME.

He looks different. He has a beard and has lost some weight:

And in his eyes, a calm we haven't seen before. He pauses in

front of the theater -- loo~s at the PUBLICITY PHOTOS. He

SEES Henry in his boxer shorts at the refrigerator meeting

"Emily" and her Sister. He sees ANOTHER PHOTO of The Dancing

Henrys kicking up their legs like Rockettes. Then, finally, A

PHOTO of Henry and Emily in bed, both wearing glasses. Harry

OPENS THE DOOR TO THE THEATER, steps inside and listens,

hearing Louis Armstrong's La Vie En Rose, then, the audience

breaks out in LAUGHTER. Harry smiles to himself.

INT. APARTMENT BUILDING CORRIDOR - EARLY EVENING

The elevator opens. Harry steps out, looks around for an

apartment number, finds it, rings the bell and clears his

throat. The door quickly OPENS and we see MARIN. She looks

relaxed and happy to see him.

A Solid Citizen of a Guy joins Marin, loosened tie,

glasses...

Marin is stumped by this little visit. Harry heads toward the

elevator, pushes the button, then turns back.

Learning Italian, remodeling her apartment in the city.

The Elevator arrives. Harry salutes his goodbye and steps

INSIDE THE ELEVATOR. He turns, FACES CAMERA.

ANOTHER ELEVATOR.OPENS

And a clean shaven, dapper looking Harry steps off, cashmere

coat, gorgeous scarf. CAMERA FOLLOWS HIM out of the elevator

and through a BEAUTIFUL LOBBY OF A HOTEL then right onto THE

STREET. CAMERA does a 360 and we catch glimpses of PARIS AT

NIGHT. CAMERA SETTLES ON HARRY just as the LIGHTS OF THE

EIFFEL TOWER POP ON, sending a flood of golden lights high

into the night sky directly behind him.

INT. LEFT BANK BISTRO - NIGHT

Erica sits alone at a table in the back of the room, drinking

a glass of wine. She looks vibrant. She glances up from her

drink and sees what looks like Harry making his way around

the tables. She leans to the side for a better look, to make

sure it's him. It is him and he's corning right toward her.

Her stomach sinks, her mind races... and before she can come

up with a single thought that makes any sense -- there he is.

Harry takes off his coat and scarf, hangs them on a hook.

Neither is sure where to go. Cheek? Lips? He lands on her

chin. .Not what he wanted, but he takes a seat across from

her. She looks at him - utterly speechless.

EXT. CARIBBEAN BEACH - FLASHBACK

Harry lies on a chaise under a palm tree, drink in hand, Hawaiian

shirt, shades. A steel drum plays in the distance.

Harry sits straight up into CAMERA.

BLACK SCREEN

A LIGHT POPS ON and we realize we are in HARRY'S CLOSET.

Harry ENTERS THE CLOSET, reaches onto a top shelf ,and starts

pulling down dozens of what used be called, "Little Black Books".

He blows dust off of the books.

FLASHBACK - HARRY'S PILGRIMAGE

Harry STANDS at one FRONT DOOR after the NEXT, EACH ONE

SLAMMING IN HIS FACE.

Then, we see WOMEN of various ages SLAP HIM ACROSS THE FACE.

Harry reels backwards from one Hefty Mama.

A Woman In Her Fifties, purposively walks down a SMALL TOWN

MAIN STREET carrying groceries.

Harry, at her side, keeps talking at her, even though she

picks up her pace and ignores him.

In a HOSPITAL ROOM, an Older Woman on life support, scrawls

out a note and shows it to Harry who sits in a chair by

herside. A Priest stands in the background. The note says,

"As I remember it, you were wildly insensitive". Harry lowers

his head in shame. She places another note in front of him.

It says, "I forgive you." Relieved, he smiles. Then, one last

note: "Now, scram."

In an Upper West Side COFFEE SHOP, Harry pas coffee

with a Woman in her Mid Forties. She talks his ear off.

Harry can' t deal with it. He looks away ~ The woman

places her hand on his chin and pulls him right back to

her and keeps talking at him.

Harry WALKS down THE STREET with a ANOTHER WOMAN in her

Thirties, who carries a cello.   She never shuts up.

At the corner, the Woman hugs Harry goodbye.

CLOSE - DIANE SAWYER

On the set of GOOD MORNING AMERICA. She glances out the

STUDIO WINDOW and sees Harry ON THE STREET among the folks

holding signs. He HOLDS A SIGN that says, "DIANE, YOU WERE

RIGHT.   I WAS ENTIRELY WRONG.   I`M SORRY."   She looks him

straight in the eye and gives 'him the finger.

HARRY - FULLY DRESSED - LYING ON HIS BED - TOP SHOT

INT. PARIS BISTRO - THE PRESENT

A HAND lands on his shoulder and he HEARS:

Harry looks up and sees handsome young Julian in a beret.

Harry looks to Erica, instantly deflated..

Harry stands. The two Men hug, then Julian squeezes in next

to Erica. Harry slowly takes his seat across from them.

He puts what can only be a RING BOX on the table between

Erica and Harry.

He kisses her. Harry watches, dying.

Harry rises, reaches for his coat.

THE WAITER POURING THE END OF A WINE BOTTLE

Everyone at the table is laughing, mid-meal. Julian is doing

the talking as well as laughing. Harry laughs along, trying

to be an approving part of their romance but he's totally

faking it.

THREE GLASSES OF BRANDY ARE SERVED - A LITTLE LATER

Erica lights a cigarette.

Julian puts his arm around her, pulls her close.

The Guys exchange looks.

Erica laughs.

The Waiter drops the check on the table. Harry takes it.

They each take out EACH OTHER'S GLASSES and put them on.

Erica points to Harry wearing her glasses and laughs.

Harry hands Erica her glasses. She hesitates. He snaps,

gesturing for his to be turned over. She hands them to him.

Julian watches all this, sobered by their chemistry.

INT. NOISY CLUB - NIGHT

Camera finds the three of them sitting at a small table. The

place is dark, loud, crowded and young. They're all drinking

champagne. The air is strained.

Harry gestures for Julian to have the first dance. Julian

takes Erica's hand and leads her to the dance floor. Harry

watches them slip through the crowd. Erica turns back, Harry

waves. Julian takes Erica in his arms, it's clear she's

comfortable in his embrace. None of .this is lost on Harry

and as he watches, the smile on his face more than fades, it

evaporates and everything inside him begins to hurt.

ANGLE - THE DANCE FLOOR

Erica and Julian -- they're sexy together.

ANGLE - THE TABLE

Harry is gone.

EXT. STREET - PARIS - NIGHT

Harry, with his collar turned up against the cold, walks past

the glass pyramid in front of The Louvre.

EXT. PONT NEUF - PARIS - MOMENTS LATER

Harry walks over the bridge, the beauty surrounding him just

making it all worse. He stops, looks out at the Seine. He

hears a classic French song in the distance, then sees a

small barge, playing the music, pass beneath him. Without

warning, a tear falls from his eye.

He stops, looks at the mighty city surrounding him. Beauty's

not supposed to hurt. Another tear.

He wipes his eyes on his coat sleeve as SNOW begins to fall.

Harry turns and sees Erica standing by a Cab with its motor

running, snow falling on her hair and coat.

The Barge drifts back under the bridge, La Vie En Rose piping

out of it's tinny speakers.

She comes close and he pulls her in, kissing her great. And

as they separate, he smiles, relieved.

FADE IN:

INT. CHIC EATERY - NYC - A HOT AUGUST NIGHT

The same restaurant from the first scene of the film - One

Year Later. Harry ENTERS FRAME, just like he did before.

The Maitre'D snaps to attention and leads Harry, Erica,

Marin, holding her Baby Girl, and her husband Danny through

the crowded restaurant. The Baby fusses and reaches out to

Harry who takes her in his arms and proudly parades her

through this swanky crowd to a round table in the center of

the room. Harry beams at the prize in his arms as he sits

with his family for a Sunday dinner.
