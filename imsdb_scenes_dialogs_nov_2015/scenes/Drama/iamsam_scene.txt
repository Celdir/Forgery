INT. STARBUCKS - 7:30 A.M.

We're watching a pair of hands arrange white sugar packets,

blue Equal packets, and pink Sweet and Low into small

containers.  With precision and lightning speed, the mixed up

colors and crumpled packets are transformed into neat little

color-coded rows.  Wait, this container has three Equals and

four Sweet 'n' lows.  The hand quickly plucks the mutant

Sweet 'n' Low.  There.  Symmetry.

We move up those hands and meet SAM DAWSON as he surveys his

domain.  Something about him.  He's extremely compelling,

uniquely handsome.  But it's more than that.  Those eyes,

they sparkle with the wonder of a child.  Life's cynical edge

has not etched it's path across this face.  They light on a

COFFEE CUP held by one of the Regulars.

Sam moves along, commenting to CUSTOMERS as he places Sweet

'n Lows on tables, the self-appointed host of Starbucks.

He stops in front of sale mugs and turns them so that the

logos all face the same way.  His boss GEORGE approaches.

Sam FREEZES, but doesn't turn around.

Without another word, Sam walks straight out the door.

EXT. LOS ANGELES STREET - DAY

Sam, still in his white apron, walks down the busy street.

He has a fast, loping gait that doesn't slow or hesitate for

anyone. A COUPLE argue on the sidewalk.  Sam WALKS RIGHT

BETWEEN THEM.

Sam keeps moving, he crosses the street without stopping.

Traffic SCREECHES to a HALT!  Cars HONK, a taxi driver YELLS.

INT. HALLWAY - LATER

Sam plows down the hall and comes to room 324.

Sam pushes the DOOR OPEN.  And we REALIZE we are entering: A

HOSPITAL LABOR DELIVERY ROOM AT LA COUNTY HOSPITAL.

REBECCA is in the middle of a major contraction.  Her face is

the opposite of Sam's.  Hardened.  She lets out a scream that

stops Sam dead in his tracks.  GERTIE, a no-nonsense Black

Nurse, looks up from the monitor.

Sam nods, taking Gertie quite literally.

Sam reaches for Rebecca's hand.  She pulls it away.  ANOTHER

CONTRACTION - Rebecca screams.  Sam SCREAMS.

INT. LABOR ROOM - LATER

The BABY lets out her first cry.  Sam watches, awestruck.

Gertie wraps the baby in a blanket and holds her out to

Rebecca.  Rebecca shakes her head - NOT NOW.  Gertie walks

over to Sam.

She places the BABY into SAM'S ARMS.  Suddenly Sam's whole

body RELAXES and becomes very still.  He looks to Rebecca,

but she has turned away.  He meets Gertie's eyes.  Then in

quiet amazement:

We hear LIKE A LULLABY, "Picture yourself on a boat in a

river with tangerine trees and marmalade skies..."

EXT. HOSPITAL - NEXT MORNING

Sam, holding the baby, and Becca, having just checked out,

walk down the steps of the hospital holding their

complimentary plastic baby bag.  Sam is nervous haling the

precious cargo and Becca is agitated.  They see the bus

pulling up and down the street and Sam moves quickly so they

can hurry and catch it.  As he approaches the bus, he looks

to Becca by his side, but she is not there.  He looks around

and no sign of her.

Frantically turning in a full circle, he sees the fabric of

her dress disappearing into the crowd down the street.  He

screams.

The more he screams the faster she moves away.  Till there's

no trace of her.  Sam stands in the middle of the busy block

holding Lucy to his chest, devastated.

We hear, "Look for the girl with the clouds in her eyes, but

she's gone."

INT. BUS - NIGHT

Sam holds the now sleeping baby to his chest.  Next to him is

the plastic bag from the hospital containing diapers, two

cans of formula and a half empty bottle of milk.  Sam is

surrounded by PASSENGERS, the eerie world of the underground

at night.  Instinctively, Sam holds her even tighter, two

against the world.

INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - DAWN

A marvel of organization.  A closet reveals clothes on

hangers exactly equidistant from each other; precisely folded

T-shirts, underwear and socks organized by color.  A

carefully systemized record collection fills makeshift

bookshelves.

Beatles posters from every era decorate the walls.  Becca's

things sit in one corner.  An island of chaos in an "Hold

Everything" showroom.  The kitchen counter has been

transformed into a changing table.  Bottles and pacifiers

lined up next to a stack of cloth diapers.  Underneath, a

clothes line of baby clothes.

The sound of a CRYING BABY breaks the silence.  The camera

follows and finds the CRADLE: a DRAWER tucked snugly into a

blanket hanging like a hammock between two chairs.  An

exhausted SAM POPS up from his bed, behind the hammock.  He

swings the hammock, hoping against hope the baby will go back

to sleep.

He rushes over to the kitchen counter and unsnaps the baby's

pajamas, revealing a cloth diaper held together with

promotional buttons: one says "Hertz, #1 for Car Rentals",

the other a picture of Magic Johnson and reads "Go, Lakers,

Go!"  Sam undoes it.

Sam attempts to clean and diaper her.  He finally manages to

pin the buttons so that it at least stays on.

He holds her up, and the diaper falls down around her ankles.

We pan across a row of diapers on a supermarket shelf:

HUGGIES, PAMPERS, EXTRA ABSORBENT PAMPERS, LUVS...

INT. WALMART - DAY

Sam stares at the "Great Wall of Diapers", awed.  He reaches

for the Pampers, balancing Lucy, then the Luvs, no, the

Huggies.  Sam stops moving, Lucy starts CRYING, so he jogs in

place.  Sam decides on one of each.  He heads to the FORMULA

AISLE.  Gerber, Carnation, Carnation Iron Fortified.  He

stops.  Lucy WAILS.  WE HEAR THE SONG "HELP, I NEED SOMEBODY"

INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - 9 P.M.

Sam paces, carrying Lucy who screams at the top of her lungs.

INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - 11:25 P.M.

Sam rocks the CRYING BABY in the hammock.  He's exhausted,

but she's just getting started.  He puts another blanket on

her.

INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - 1:30 A.M.

Peace.  A punch-drunk Sam lays the sleeping baby into the

cradle as if she were a bomb that might detonate.

He tiptoes, his FIST raised victoriously - "YES!"  He doesn't

get two steps before Lucy wakes screaming.  Defeated, he

picks her up.  HELP.  The PHONE RINGS.  HE PRESSES speaker.

He looks out his window and sees ANNIE CASSELL, his neighbor

on the phone, watching him through her window.  She is a

strange creature with very thick glasses.  We sense a

uniquely profound intelligence behind all that armor.

EXT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

ANNIE has her door open a crack.  Annie feels the baby's

forehead.  Lucy stares up at her, quiet now, fascinated.

INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - EVENING

We are watching "Hogan's Heroes".  We hear SHULTZ'S INFAMOUS

RESPONSE: "I know nothing, absolutely nothing!"  Sam feeds a

content Lucy.

INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - LATER

"Father Knows Best" on TV.  Lucy blissfully falls asleep in

Sam's arms.  Euphoric, he tiptoes to the cradle and places

her ever so gently, when suddenly, the FRONT DOOR FLIES OPEN.

Sam's BEST FRIENDS DESCEND inside: IFTY, a Pakistani

gentlemen with a gentle face and a wide smile, carrying a

large stuffed giraffe with a bow on it.  BRAD, who sees

himself as a real ladies man, in tight jeans and a Farrah

Fawcett T-shirt; and ROBERT, highly paranoid, thinks the

world's out to get him.  Lucy WAILS.  Sam RUNS to the CRIB.

Ifty makes ORIGAMI BIRDS out of newspapers.  Lucy's rapt.

There's a knock at the door.  Ifty goes to get it.  Brad

moans when he sees his 65 YEAR OLD MOTHER, ESTELLE, standing

in the doorway.

She exits.  Lucy begins to CRY.  Brad takes her - like a hot

potato, Robert takes her - now Ifty runs around in circles.

And it all starts again and we --

EXT. BUS - NIGHT

An empty bus makes its way through the city at night.

INT. BUS - NIGHT

The camera moves along and stops on the long seat at the

back.  Sam lies with Lucy spooned into the crook of his arm,

almost asleep.

We hear the song "Golden Slumbers".  In a SERIES OF

DISSOLVES, we see Lucy and Sam in DIFFERENT SLEEPING

POSITIONS on the bus seat.  Gradually, she GROWS in HIS

PROTECTIVE EMBRACE --

ONE MONTH,  THEN TWO.  NOW FIVE.  She's BIG AND ROUND at SIX

MONTHS.  And on and on into the night...

INT. WALMART'S PHOTO BOOTH - DAY

We see Sam and Lucy CRAMMED into the booth, wearing birthday

hats, taking HER FIRST BIRTHDAY picture.  We see the PHOTO

STRIP as it comes out of the slot.  Sam's shoulder with

Lucy's ear - Lucy's nose with Sam's elbow, their faces never

made it into the picture.

INT. STARBUCKS - 8:30 A.M.

The place is packed.  Sam moves from table to table,

cleaning.

Sam turns and WE SEE LUCY attached to him in a handmade

snugly, crocheted by Annie.  She faces outward, all hands,

all 16 MONTHS of her; too big for the snugly.  She grabs a

croissant from a customer.  George looks confused.  Then

makes a SWIPE for a customer's coffee, knocking it to the

ground.  It SPLATTERS all over an anorexic, on-her-fourth

double-latte WOMAN in a designer exercise outfit.  She begins

shrieking.  George looks at Sam, this can't go on.

INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - MORNING

Sam, Lucy by his side, has his foot in Annie's door.

Annie opens the door, takes Lucy's hand, and pulls her in.

INT. ANNIE'S APARTMENT - ONE WEEK LATER

The apartment looks like a fallout shelter.  The kitchen

contains enough canned goods to last a year.  Brightly

colored crocheted doilies - Annie's hobby - adorn every

available surface.  The BRIGHTLY COLORED WEB of an

AGORAPHOBE.

Lucy sits in Annie's lap, getting her first piano lesson.  WE

SEE LUCY'S TINY FINGERS on the keys.  In a SERIES OF

DISSOLVES, it is joined by Annie's hand tapping out one note,

now two notes, and as the weeks pass, a chord.  Until finally

the notes merge to become the most unlikely duet of "Twinkle,

Twinkle, Little Star".

Lucy leaves the piano and toddles over to Annie's loom and

plays with a ball yarn.

Annie opens the door to pull in the groceries.  The ball of

yarn ROLLS OUT the door and Lucy chases after it.  Annie,

terrified, bellows:

It becomes obvious Annie can't walk outside.  Trembling:

Hearing the familiar tune, Lucy stops and toddles back.

Annie sweeps her up, relieved and we --

INT. KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT

Sam on stage, with Ifty and Brad as his back-up singers,

continuing the song in the oddest, most heartfelt version to

Lucy who sits on Robert's lap and in heaven.

EXT. PARK - DAY

A beautiful blue sky.  And "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"

continues as Lucy's THREE YEAR OLD laughing face SWINGS INTO

FRAME on a swing then DISAPPEARS out THE OTHER END OF FRAME.

Now Lucy SWINGS BACK DOWN and out of the other end again...

Sam's FACE, glowing with delight, APPEARS AGAINST THE SKY and

then disappears.  Sam and Lucy are on swings surrounded by

MOTHERS and KIDS at the park.

EXT. PARK - ONE YEAR LATER

Lucy FLIES INTO FRAME, now FOUR, sitting on Sam's lap,

swinging.

EXT. PARK - ONE YEAR LATER

Then Lucy FLIES INTO FRAME, now FIVE, followed by Sam.

ON SAM'S FACE

He knew this moment would come.

INT. DENNY'S - THURSDAY NIGHT DINNER - EVENING

Lucy and Sam are having a serious talk over breaded Sole.

Lucy takes this in.  Sam begins to shift his tomatoes just

so... his potatoes just slightly to the left.  Lucy watches.

ON SAM'S FACE

Filled with relief.  Bursting with love.

Grace approaches with two plates of pie, ice cream on the

side.

INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - THURSDAY NIGHT VIDEO NIGHT

As they go on, Lucy matter-of-factly PULLS A VIDEO OUT OF HER

BACKPACK, and puts it in the VCR.  She turns it on.  It's

"Kramer vs. Kramer".  Everyone stops their arguing and stares

at Lucy.

INT. CHILDREN'S SHOE STORE - DAY

A row of brand new children's shoes on display.  Lucy tries

on dozens of school shoes, surrounded by Sam and her

"Godfathers": Ifty, Brad and Robert.

Meanwhile, Lucy has been trying on a simple brown shoe.

They all dig in their pockets and begin counting very slowly.

EXT. STREET NEAR SHOE STORE - DAY

Those new little brown shoes walking in between four pairs of

man's shoes.  We move up from those shoes to see FIVE PAIR OF

HANDS tightly clasping their balloons as they march

victoriously down the street.  We MOVE IN on Lucy's little

brown shoes skipping with joy and --

EXT. SCHOOL FIELD - DAY

Those same little shoes in the midst of a mass of black

soccer cleats.  We move up and see Lucy in the middle of a

fierce kids soccer game.

Score's tied.  The ball comes to Lucy.  She kicks and misses.

From the sidelines we hear:

Lucy looks up at her dad proudly.  The ball comes again.

Nobody could miss this one.  But Lucy does.

The game continues.  The GOALIE'S FATHER, DUNCAN RHODES,

handsome, commanding and dressed in a suit, calls to his son:

Conner tenses up, alert under the pressure.  Meanwhile, down

at the other end, the ball heads toward Lucy.  She kicks it!

Hard.  Right into her team's own goal.  The crowd GROANS.

Lucy's bursting with confidence, plows toward the ball and

NAILS IT!  The ball goes flying.  The parents in the stand

are completely baffled!  Sam is completely ecstatic!

The ball heads into the goal, just passing the goalie,

Conner.  Sam runs to embrace Lucy when he hears Duncan

reaming his son --

Conner slouches against the fence as his father walks away.

Seeing this, Sam whispers to Lucy.

INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

A child's hand double jumps across a checker board.

Lucy and Conner are playing checkers while Sam cooks dinner.

Two carrots cut into ten pieces. Bow Tie Pasta - 35 pieces

each.

Their hands graze against each other on the check board - he

pulls his hand away.

He crowns her - her eyes shift to Sam in the kitchen, for the

first time a bit uneasily.

INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Sam's reading Lucy her homework book.

Sam glances up at Lucy self-consciously.  Lucy grabs the book

from Sam, tosses it on the pile and picks up another.

Relieved, Sam plunges into the book, which is more memorized

than read.

They both laugh, delighted.  Lucy looks sleepy.

Lucy is getting drowsy.  Sam is just getting started.

Lucy nods, a little deflated.

Lucy sighs and closes her eyes against her father's chest.

INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

Lucy draws a picture while everyone reads aloud from

"STELLALUNA".

Lucy runs out of the class.

EXT. BUS STOP - DUSK

Sam, in sunglasses, waits for the BUS.  A YOUNG WOMAN, LILY,

sits down next to him.  The WIND CATCHES her floral dress

that's just left of innocent; just right of alluring.  She

reads a TABLOID.

She crosses her legs.  A tuft of pink dress falls on Sam's

knee.

She takes Sam's hand, they move to get on the bus JUST AS

ANOTHER HAND brusquely lands on theirs.

A lightbulb flashes and we --

INT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - THAT NIGHT

Sam blinks as his MUGSHOT is being taken.  Now the profile.

He turns so they can get the back of his head.  Now the

FINGERPRINT.

Now Sam, in the corner of the room, on the phone making

thumbprints on the wall.  While the COP discusses his case

with a social worker, MARGARET BROWN.  Over the years she's

seen it all, and to get through it has had to pretend it's

just a job.

Her cell phone beeps.

Margaret watches Sam as he talks to Lucy on the phone.

INT. PRINCIPALS OFFICE - DAY

The WALLS are lined with CHILDREN'S ART.  Various

interpretations of the family.  We stop at one of a very

small man and a very big little girl with her arm around him.

We PULL BACK and see Sam staring at the picture.  Mrs. Wright

and the principal watch him.

INT. LUCY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

It's bedtime.  Sam and Lucy are reading from "STELLALUNA".

He holds the book open for Lucy.  Now Lucy, pushing through a

mountain of resistance, reads.  And reads beautifully.

INT. SCHOOL HALLOWEEN PARADE - AUDITORIUM - DAY

Two children, dressed as Batman, march followed by

CINDERELLA.  We see Lucy dressed in NEWSPAPER - an ORIGAMI

BIRD.  And behind her, marching more proudly than any child,

is Sam, dressed as PAUL McCARTNEY, in the black suit era -

with Beatle boots and guitar strapped to his chest.  Sam is

the only adult participating in the parade.

Music BLASTS over the loudspeaker.  Sam begins to dance with

joyous abandon.  Lucy joins him.  They dance together

happily.

Suddenly Lucy becomes aware that her classmates are beginning

to laugh.  She slows and watches through their eyes Sam pony

around the room.  Conner pulls up his pants high on his waist

and begins to imitate Sam.  Another kid joins him.

Lucy's face hardens for the first time.  In a corrupt world

the pure can only stay pure for so long.

INT. HAMBURGER HAMLET - EVENING

Sam and Lucy sit in a booth.  Lucy's ecstatic.  Sam's trying.

Sam anxiously rearranges the condiments on the table.  Lucy

tries to fold a napkin into an Origami bird.

ON LUCY

Her smile fades.

INT. DENNY'S - HALF-HOUR LATER

Sam happily eats his fish special with six new potatoes.

Lucy's untouched dinner sits in the middle of the table.  She

doodles on the placement - drawing a man sitting with a pile

of new potatoes in front of him; larger than he is.

INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - DAY

Balloons and a banner reading "Happy Birthday, Lucy!"  For

Lucy's birthday, Sam has rented a moon bounce - which sits in

the center of the apartment and filling the entire place -

leaving no room for the few kids and their parents.  Brad

stands too close to a young attractive mother.  Robert shakes

all the presents suspiciously.

There's a KNOCK at the door.

Brad hits the lights.  Sam OPENS THE DOOR and everyone yells

"SURPRISE!"  But instead of Lucy, it's the Social Worker.

Sam puts a hand over Conner's mouth; Conner struggles against

him.

Conner's father hurls Sam across the room - Sam gets tangled

in the MOON BOUNCE!  To get attention, Conner bursts into

tears.  We hear FOOTSTEPS outside the door - Brad hits the

lights.  We hear a CRASH!  And in the light, the DOOR SHEDS

as it opens, Lucy and Ifty see - that MOONBOUNCE, swaying.

Then from within the Moonbounce:

Lucy stands frozen, holding a red balloon.

Humiliated, Lucy RUNS AWAY!  The Social Worker watches,

profoundly concerned, and reaches for her cellular phone.

EXT. WALMART - DAY

A police car pulls into the parking lot.  Sam and Margaret in

the back.  Sam and Margaret see Lucy's little feet dangling

from beneath the curtain of the photo booth.

Sam's baffled.  One cop places his hand on Sam's shoulder,

restraining him.  The OTHER heads toward the photo booth.

Sam watches the cop's legs meet Lucy's under the curtain.

Suddenly, Sam screams from the deepest core of his being.

We see LUCY'S FEET KICK the COP'S LEGS and wrestle out of his

grasp.  She flies out the booth, holding that balloon.  She

runs down the street, the balloon soaring into the sky - a

cop follows.  Sam struggles.

ON SAM

Reeling, devastated, we HEAR A JUDGE speaking:

INT. COURTROOM - DAY

Sam sits ALONE.  At another table, Margaret Brown and a

lawyer, along with several people from the CPS.

INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - DAY

Sam's on the phone, a teddy bear in his hand.  Robert, Ifty,

and Brad all sit with Yellow Pages open in front of them.

INT. RITA HARRISON'S CENTURY CITY OFFICE - DAY

A Century City lawyer spins in front of our eyes.  It's SAM'S

POV as he sits in a chair that spins - in the center of RITA

HARRISON'S lavish, penthouse office.  Now we see the

panoramic of Los Angeles.  Now the dots in the Lichtenstein

on the wall WHIRL PAST US.  Now the DOOR SWINGS OPEN AND --

RITA HARRISON and her assistant burst in.  Rita moves in

opposite circles around the room.  Looking for something.  In

fact, as we watch Rita, we realize that she never stops

moving.  Period.  Ten steps ahead of anyone, too much energy,

too much caffeine, not enough food.  If she slowed down a

beat she might get vulnerable.  Can't have that.  Can't be

wrong.  Can't really look you in the eye.  Can't help it if

she's smarter than anyone else in the room.  Any room.  Any

time.

ON RITA

Hmmmm?

TEN MINUTES LATER --

Sam is in the middle of the beginning of his story.  Rita on

her second cappuccino, eyes her computer screen for calls.

We HEAR MUSIC coming from the other end of the phone --

She unconsciously digs through the bowl of jelly beans on her

desk sorting out all the yellow ones.

She pours the bowl of jelly beans onto her desk, now

frantically sorting through them.

Rita stands up, ushering him to the door.

She turns, ahhhh!  He's gone!  She begins searching the room.

Stunned, Rita looks up and sees Sam holding up a strip of

photos taken at the birthday booth.

Out of his pocket he pulls another photo strip.

Rita looks at the photo strip of Lucy's birthday.  In the

first three we see Lucy's sad face.  The fourth has a cop's

face smashed into the frame with her.

Rita LUNGES FOR THE PHONE.

She checks her watch, puts him on the SPEAKER PHONE, and

frantically searches the room for her keys.

Silence.  We hear SIX LOUD THUDS - the sound of a basketball

bouncing against the floor.

CLICK!  The LINE GOES DEAD.  Rita trips over the coffee

table, completely losing it.

She kicks it, sending the lemonade jelly beans FLYING.  Then,

after a beat.

INT. STARBUCKS - DAY

Sam is face to face with George.

INT. RUBEL BLY HARRISON AND WILLIAMS - 8:15 P.M.

A group of Rita's colleagues are celebrating a big win.  Rita

is backing out of the room with her glass of champagne.

She stops, stunned, as she sees Sam, sitting in the lobby

holding out a Starbucks Cappuccino.

To avoid any further interaction, she heads back to the

employee party she previously escaped from.  Sam walks down

the hall.

Her assistant Patricia clears her throat.

Muffled laughter from her colleagues.

Rita runs to the open elevator and comes face to face with

Sam who's been holding the door open for her.

INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

The door closes.  Rita is trapped with Sam.  She stares

forward trying to will him not there.  Rita gulps her

champagne.

And on and on and on.  Rita is about to spontaneously

combust.  Finally, "G" - Rita bolts out the elevator doors,

then just as suddenly turns around.

Sam, shaking with relief, pulls out his wallet just as the

elevator door starts closing.

The doors close.  We hear from within, as Sam goes up again:

INT. BUS - MORNING

Sam stares out the window at an unfamiliar neighborhood.  On

his lap, the pink box, now ripped, allowing us to see Lucy's

birthday cake.  It's lopsided from having been thawed and

refrozen.

EXT. BUS STOP - NOON

Sam waits for his transfer.  He sets the cake down on the

bench and takes out a piece of paper with directions written

on it.  The number 43 bus pull sup and Sam consults his paper

once more before jumping on, forgetting the cake.

The bus goes half a block before it SCREECHES to a halt.  Sam

jumps off and runs back for the cake, but the bus continues

on its way.  Moments later, the NUMBER 34 bus pulls up.

Flustered and worried about being late, Sam jumps on.  He

feels something cold on his hand, looks down, the box is

starting to leak ice cream.

INT. SOCIAL WORKERS OFFICE - DAY

Lucy, Margaret, a therapist and a child psychologist wait for

Sam.

Suddenly through the door comes Sam CARRYING THE MELTED,

DRIPPING birthday cake.  Lucy runs to him.

INT. THE SOCIAL WORKER'S SMALL GREY OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Margaret, the therapist (Ms. Geller), and the Child

Pscyhologist all write voraciously into note pads as they

observe Sam and Lucy who sit in the center of the room,

nervous under their scrutiny.

They move to hug each other.  EVERYONE REACHES for their

pens.  Sam pulls back self-consciously.  Everyone writes even

harder.

He's right.  Her eyes are older.  He hugs her - ALL THE PENS

GO UP.

The writing starts again.

Lucy looks at her father lovingly.

She looks around to see if anybody's writing.  NOBODY IS.

She suddenly screams at them:

INT. RITA'S OFFICE - DAY

We hear sobbing and see Rita sitting across from a very rich,

very angry COUPLE.  Rita's foot is twitching furiously.

The woman is distracted by a loud thumping on Rita's glass

wall - it's SAM.  Holding an envelope.  Very distressed, as

the Secretary attempts to corral him back into the lobby.

He hands the letter to Rita.  Rita looks through the glass

wall at her clients who are getting impatient.

Sam notices that the woman in Rita's office is crying.  He

walks in and hands her a handkerchief from his pocket.

She looks at him as if he's from Mars.  Rita, now outside her

office, watches Sam now inside the office.

She quickly gets up but Rita's too impatient and pushes past

her into the office.

Rita looks at the Couple leaving her office.

INT. RITA'S PORSCHE - DAY

Redefining road rage, Rita's slamming the horn.  Sam next to

her.

She cuts around the car in front of her; flips him off, and

in a split second that her head is turned, almost SMASHES

into the car in front of her!  She slams on the brakes.

Rita looks over at Sam, forced to stop.

INT. PSYCHOLOGIST OFFICE - DAY

Sam sits across from a shrink, MS. GELLER, nervously

straightening her desk.

Sam nods nervously and waves.  With that she begins.

INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Sam, Ifty, Brad and Robert hover over a used answering

machine.  Ifty pours over the instructions.

BEEP! the tape runs out.

INT. GROUP HOME - NIGHT

Mrs. Kerry unlocks the phone and dials.  She hands the phone

to Lucy who waits eagerly in her pj's.  Sam's answering

machine clicks on; as if on slow speed.

INT. RITA'S OFFICE - DAY

Rita and Sam walk through the lobby at Rita's Olympic pace.

She passes the elevator and heads for the stairs.

Rita heads up the stairs.  We hear a BEEP.  Then another.

Rita checks her heart rate watch.  Starts walking up the

stairs.

Rita looks at Sam as she bounds up the fourth floor.

A look of horror falls across her face.  She does a 180 and

starts RUNNING down the stairs reading the list.

INT. RITA'S OFFICE - THE VERY NEXT DAY

Ifty sits across from Rita who attempts to take notes.

He looks up at her, lost.  So is she.

INT. RITA'S OFFICE - DAY

ON BRAD

Who sits across from Rita.  She tape records him.

INT. RITA'S OFFICE - DAY

Robert sits across from Rita, who records him.

INT. RITA'S OFFICE - LATER

Rita maniacally picks the frosting off a donut.

Over her INTERCOM, we hear SAM'S ANSWERING MACHINE.

EXT. STREETS - DAY

Rita stands next to her Porsche.  There are Starbucks in

every direction she looks.

INT. STARBUCKS - DAY

Sam is straightening Sweet and Lows.  Rita barrels in.

She takes out her car beeper, clicks it towards the window

and realizes that they're towing her car!

INT. ANNIE'S APARTMENT - EVENING

Annie is at the piano, lost in a Beethoven concerto.

Annie plays even harder.  Frustrated, he POUNDS the piano.

INT. COURTROOM - DAY

We HEAR A VOICE:

Sam stands along with others in the courtroom.  The Judge

enters and sits.  Everyone else sits now, too.  Except Sam.

Who continues to stand until Rita pulls him down.  Now we

see:

Ifty, Robert, Brad - and Brad's MOTHER, who sits several

seats behind Brad knitting.  Robert holds up a handmade sign

from the back of the courtroom "Free Lucy Dawson".

INT. COURTROOM - ONE HOUR LATER

Turner, the prosecuting attorney, examines his first witness.

He's disheveled, but don't let the rumpled suit fool you.

This man is razor-sharp.  The THERAPIST who evaluated Sam is

on the stand.  Sam anxiously rearranges all the pens on the

desk he sits at with Rita.  Projected on a SCREEN is a SLIDE

of the drawing Lucy made in school.

Sam TUGS at Rita's sleeve.  She ignores it.

Rita starts to scribble notes furiously.  So does Sam.

Turner smugly sits down.  Rita confidently strides toward the

witness.

INT. COURTROOM CAFETERIA - DAY

Sam and Rita go down the cafeteria line.

The CAFETERIA WORKER stares at him.  Yeah.  Sure he will.

Sam is anxiously separating his Lima beans and corn into

separate piles.  They arrive at the cashier.  Rita pulls out

her billfold.  Sam reaches for his wallet.

Rita looks at him.  He's right.  She chooses her words

carefully.

He reaches for the receipt, and faces the CASHIER defiantly.

He slowly counts his money, takes his tray and walks away.

Rita watches him, with a trace of remorse and a hint of

admiration.

INT. COURTROOM - DAY

DR. DONOVAN, an attractive soft-spoken woman is on the stand.

Rita is working the room.  Sam, having a hard time

concentrating, is following a crack up the wall and onto the

ceiling.

Sam runs to hug Dr. Donovan, bumping into Rita who sits him

down.

ON SAM

Devastated.

INT. INSTITUTIONAL GRAY SOCIAL WORKERS OFFICE - DAY

Margaret Brown observes Sam and Lucy.

Sam shoots a look at Margaret.  He hasn't heard anything nice

about himself in so long.  Lucy looks into her father's eyes.

Sam shoots ANOTHER look.  He doesn't want to lie.  Lucy

catches the look between Sam and Margaret.

Sam attempts to undo it.  Lucy and he work very slowly,

cherishing each moment together.

She undoes it quickly.  Hands it back.

INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Lucy's feet dangle from under the stall.  Margaret's sturdy

shoes from under another.  Suddenly, Lucy's head pops out and

now she quietly wriggles out from under the stall, tip toes

across the room and out the door.  Locking it with a key.

INT. SOCIAL WORKERS ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Lucy runs up to her father.

INT. BUS - DAY

Sam and Lucy hold hands and look out the window.  Sam sees

Echo Park approaching and gets up.  Lucy pulls him back to

the seat.  She looks Daddy in the eye and in a furtive

whisper:

Sam reels with confusion.  Lucy buries herself in his chest.

The bus has stopped.  Passengers for the park have exited.

Sam doesn't move.  As the BUSDRIVER closes the door and heads

on, he holds Lucy protectively to his chest.

INT. BUS - NIGHT

Lucy sleeps cuddled close to Sam, who is wide awake, as he

gazes out at the passing highway, far from home.  We hear the

song "Michelle".

EXT. PARK - 4 A.M.

Sam, totally disoriented, walks in circles around the plastic

tunnels and jungle gym.  A flashlight shines in Sam's face.

He moves toward Sam.  SUDDENLY THE SPRINKLER SYSTEM goes on.

The cop backs off, but Sam doesn't move, standing in the

middle of the park and getting totally wet.

He shines the flashlight in Sam's face and we see INSIDE THE

PLASTIC TUNNEL where LUCY SLEEPS PEACEFULLY on a bed of

coats, holding a discarded stuffed animal.

All the cop sees is a lunatic walking in protective circles

in the downpour of the sprinklers with a kid in a plastic

tunnel.

INT. POLICE STATION - DAWN

Police doors swing open as Rita, coat over pj's, a sleepy

DANNY by her side, storm inside.  Lucy lies on a bench with

her head in Sam's lap.

Danny turns the corner just as Margaret Brown rushes in.

Rita turns to her - her expression changes on a dime.

Margaret's cell phone RINGS.

The FIRE ALARM GOES OFF and --

Rita avoids Margaret's look.  Margaret's cell phone goes off

again.  She doesn't answer.  Now Rita looks at Margaret, but

this time Margaret avoids looking at her.  Lucy runs to Rita

and throws her arms around her waist.

Rita is disarmed.  She's moved and not used to being moved.

INT. COURTROOM - DAY

Lucy's in her best dress, being sworn in.  One hand in the

air.

And now CAMERA MOVES AROUND HER AND WE SEE THAT SHE'S HIDING

HER OTHER HAND BEHIND HER BACK - FINGERS CROSSED.

INT. COURTROOM - LATER

Lucy is on the stand, Turner is cross-examining her.

Lucy looks to her father and Rita.

ON RITA AND SAM

What is she doing?

Next to her skirt, we see her fingers are crossed so hard

they're practically turning purple.

Rita glares at Margaret.  Thanks a lot.

A LONG SILENCE.  She stares at Turner defiantly.

INT. COURTROOM CORRIDOR - DAY

WE HEAR THAT SONG as Sam and Rita walk out of the courtroom.

Rita is breaking pieces off a candy bar she has stuffed in

her purse.  They see Lucy running down the corridor toward

Sam, Margaret Brown behind her.

Rita watches Sam.  Moved by his concern as a parent.

They lead her down the hallway toward Mrs. Kerry - Sam's

voice gets louder and louder - determined to make her hear.

INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The darkness of Sam's apartment.  We see him on his knees.

Saying his prayers by his bedside.

We see ANNIE'S SILHOUETTE from the window of her apartment as

it moves across the frame.

INT. COURTROOM - DAY

Turner cross examines George, the manager of Starbucks.

George searches for a way to tell the truth.

Sam leaps to his feet.

Rita pulls him down.  Turner seizes the moment.

INT. COURTROOM CORRIDOR - LATER

Rita prepares Ifty.

Rita's twitching foot knocks over her purse.  Out spill

several Snickers Bars with the chocolate picked off them.

Embarrassed, she kneels to pick them up when she and Sam see

something that stops them both, awestruck.  In the corner of

the corridor, huddled on a bench in dark sunglasses, sits

ANNIE IN A PROFESSIONAL BUSINESS SUIT.  Sam runs to her.

INT. COURTROOM - FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER

Annie, wearing her dark glasses, is being questioned by Rita.

INT. COURTROOM - LATER

Turner stands where Rita did.

ON RITA AND SAM

This is too good to be true.

A long pause.  Sam watches as Annie visibly tightens.

Annie reaches for her water glass.  We see her hand SHAKE.

It knocks over the glass, shattering it on the floor.

Rita doesn't stop him.  The Judge hesitates, incredulous,

then pounds the gavel as the courtroom erupts.

EXT. SAM'S APARTMENT - DUSK

Rita sits in her Porsche with Annie and Sam.  Annie is curled

into a tight ball in the passenger seat.  Sam is tucked into

the shelf in the back.  His legs kick Rita in the face with

every gear shift.

Annie doesn't move.

Rita reaches across to open Annie's door when she SCREAMS!

INT. PORSCHE - TWO HOURS LATER

It's dark now.  Annie is still catatonic.  Rita's on the car

phone, the kind that voice activates and she's yelling.

Sam's fallen asleep.

EXT. RITA'S LAVISH BEL AIR HOME - NIGHT

Rita and Sam enter.

INT. RITA'S BEL AIR HOME - NIGHT

Sam is awestruck at the magnificent home.

They pass another room and see Danny zoned out in front of

the wide-screen TV watching MUTANT NINJA TURTLES.

Her CELL PHONE goes off.  Rita moves into the hallway to

answer her phone.  Sam moves into the den, sits on the couch,

the sound of Rita arguing with her husband drifts into the

room.  Sam looks sideways at Danny who remains stonefaced.

Rita stands in the doorway watching Sam have a longer

conversation with her son than she's had in months.  She

retreats.

INT. RITA'S DEN - LATER

Danny and Sam eat popcorn watching the movie.

He heads towards Rita.

INT. PANTRY - CONTINUOUS

In the half-light Sam catches a glimpse of Rita standing in

the pantry unconsciously stuffing marshmallows into her

mouth.  Their eyes lock for a moment.

INT. RITA'S LIBRARY - MOMENTS LATER

Sam comes out of the bathroom in the new suit.  Rita stares

at him astonished.  He looks incredibly handsome.  Rita,

attempting to stifle her reaction, turns away from Sam.

Rita stands behind Sam with her around him showing him how to

do his tie properly.  Their images are reflected in the

mirror.

Rita comes around to the front and straightens and tightens

the tie.  They are both nervous.  The room is charged.

Rita shifts uneasily, embarrassed by her overreaction.

INT. RITA'S LIBRARY - LATER

INT. RITA'S LIBRARY - TWO HOURS LATER

Rita is relentless.  Sam is exhausted but determined.

Sam jumps up from the table, trembling with anger.

By this time he is face to face with Rita, breathing hard,

overcome with emotion.  Rita is unexpectedly near tears.

Suddenly before she knows it, she is HOLDING SAM.  The room

charged.  She speaks tenderly, moved by this awkward boy/man.

INT. STARBUCKS - MORNING

Sam rushes into the coffee shop in his new suit.

George leads him behind the counter.  THE STAFF BEAMS.

Euphorically, Sam approaches the huge espresso machines.

INT. STARBUCKS - 11:00 A.M.

Sam is doing great.  He's humming as he prepares a triple

latte with the precision of a Swiss watchmaker.

INT. STARBUCKS - 12:00 P.M.

The place is packed, including a GROUP OF JAPANESE TOURISTS.

Sam zips around, trying to juggle between the blender, the

espresso machine, steamed milk, icemaker, all the while

glancing up at the clock.  Sam hands three cups to customers,

the foam overflowing, coffee spilling out.

A CUSTOMER takes a sip and SPITS IT OUT.

Working as fast as he can but still NOT FAST ENOUGH, Sam

unconsciously drinks the latte.

INT. STARBUCKS - 12:45 P.M.

Hyped on coffee, Sam is zooming around and he's a mess.

Shirt hangs out, coffee stains on it, his hair wild.

Frazzled, he forgets to put the lid on the blender and turns

it ON.  A mint mocha frappuccino SPLATTERS HIM in the face.

At that moment, George comes out of his office.

Sam heads out, the coffee drink still dripping from his face.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Walking a hundred miles an hour, Sam barrels down the street

out of his mind.  Cars are jammed up.  He walks over them, a

man possessed.

INT. COURTROOM - DAY

Everyone is in their places, waiting.

At THAT MOMENT, Sam bursts through the doors.  Suit stained,

hair sticky with frappuccino.  Rita's jaw drops.

Rita heads towards Sam.  Up close, he looks even worse.

Sam, determined, heads for the stand.  Rita grabs Sam's

shoulders and tries to focus him.  Looks deep into his eyes.

INT. COURTROOM - LATER

Sam, on the stand, talks a mile a minute from the coffee.

Sam puts his finger to his chin and starts his "Let me

see..." Rita gives him a look; he lowers his finger and

starts talking very fast from the coffee.  The STENOGRAPHER

desperately tries to keep pace.

ON RITA

Well, he has some kind of point.

MARY, the Stenographer, is still typing.

INT. COURTROOM - LATER

Turner fires questions at Sam - a mile a minute.

ON RITA

Trying to telepathically reach Sam.

Sweat pours down Sam's coffee stained collar.  He searches

for words.  Then from the clearest place inside himself:

The court is riveted by Sam's eloquence.  Rita's amazed.

Rita's antenna goes up: who's "she?"

All eyes TURN to the back of the room.  Ifty is there trying

with all his might to help his friend.

Mortified, so uncomfortable in this strange world, so at a

loss how to swim through it, beginning to believe everything

Turner's saying, Sam looks out at the faces in the courtroom.

Rita, stunned and incredulous; Turner and his associate

smirking at him; Ifty, shaking his head; Robert, his face in

his hands; Miss Wright, Margaret Brown, the State's Expert,

almost willing him to fail.  Are they right?  Are they?

ON TURNER

There.  He got it.

ON RITA

Anguished.  Watching Sam unravel as he stands up and starts

walking around in a circle in the witness box.

The Judge watches Sam, sad and stunned.  The verdict is

obvious.  Sam has passed judgement on himself.

EXT. CHILD AND FAMILY PROTECTIVE SERVICES - HALLWAY

Sam, broken, walks down the long hallway with Rita toward

Margaret Brown's office.  Suddenly, Rita stops as she and Sam

both see -

LUCY

Sitting, hopeful on the bench.  She searches Sam's face for

the verdict.  The minute she sees sorrow in his eyes, she

knows.  She runs to him, gluing herself to his chest.

In a SERIES OF WORDLESS DISSOLVES, they hold each other in

the hallway through the entire forty five minute visit.  The

only thing moving is the hands of a large wall clock in the

background.  Pained, Margaret reaches for Lucy.

Sam's tears mix with Lucy's as they sob, clinging to each

other.  With such fierce love; a parent and a child.

He can't let her go.  That he can't do.  Margaret, steel

herself, turns to Rita, no matter how many times she's done

this.

Rita, aching from a place she thought she buried long ago,

shakes her head, NO.  Now, Margaret literally has to wrench

Lucy away from her father's arms.  Lucy bellowing as she

pulls her down the hallway.  Sam is frozen in incalculable

pain.

EXT. SAM'S APARTMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

We hear "Fool on the Hill".  We follow a trail of PINK LIQUID

melting down the hall and come to Annie's door where a pile

of grocery bags and newspapers sit in a PUDDLE OF STRAWBERRY

ICE CREAM.  Suddenly, the needle SCRAPES LOUDLY across the

record, followed by a mysterious POUNDING against the wall.

INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The CAMERA MOVES to the WINDOW.  Inside, the lights are dim.

Lucy's HAMMOCK SWINGS EMPTY, ghostlike.  Sam, curled into a

ball in Lucy's bare corner, bangs his head over and over

again against the wall, overcome with grief.

INT. DANNY'S ROOM - RITA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The POUNDING CONTINUES as we see Rita standing in the

doorway, watching her sleeping child.  This stranger that

she's raised.  She moves to cover him, this tough little boy,

when she sees POOH BEAR tucked under his arm.  She tucks them

both in, tenderly.

EXT. CARPENTER HOUSE - DAY

Saturday in idyllic suburbia.  Sam, directions and a map in

his hands, tentatively rounds the corner.  A small bouquet of

flowers in his hands when he stops - STARING AHEAD AT --

REVERSE ANGLE

Lucy looking absolutely radiant in a new spring dress.  She

stands on the front porch with RANDY, who wears a red smock

and is setting up TWO EASELS AND PAINTS.  There's a tiny

chair for Lucy and a tiny chair for her.

CLOSE ON LUCY AND RANDY

The tension in Lucy's face, Randy straining to connect with

her.

BACK TO SAM

From where he stands, all he sees is Lucy getting everything

she deserves.  He looks down at the tiny bouquet in his hand -

feeling profoundly inadequate, he reaches for some flowers

from a garden he's passing.  Puts them in his bouquet.  Then

stops.  Feels guilty.  Tries to put the flowers BACK.  He

stares up at Lucy on the porch a few houses away.

Lucy sits on the steps.  Randy sits right next to her.

BACK ON SAM

Where he WAS standing, but is now GONE.  The flowers lay in

the dirt.  From the porch, Lucy looks out and waits.  And

waits.  And waits.

INT. STARBUCKS - DAY

It's Saturday.  The place is buzzing.  Sam listlessly cleans

the tables, without the usual energy and verve.  A TODDLER

marches around a table, playing under the adoring gaze of his

parents.

Sam sees a FAMILY at a table covered with spilled coffee.

Sam's out of control, the whole shop stares at him as he

backs into a shelf of MUGS he so carefully arranged.  They

CRASH onto the floor.

EXT. CARPENTER PORCH - DAY

Paints and brushes go FLYING across the porch as Lucy KNOCKS

THEM OVER.  Totally out of control.

As Randy reaches for her, Lucy pours black paint on her.

EXT. CARPENTER HOUSE - DUSK

Lucy sits in a ball on the corner of the porch.  Her eyes

swollen from crying.  Finally, she gets up and moves to the

tiny chair that Randy put out for her.  Straightens the easel

and begins to paint.

The front door opens and Randy comes out having washed her

face and hair.  Without speaking, Randy straightens her easel

and sits down next to Lucy and begins to paint.  Randy and

Lucy paint in silence for a long time.  Then -

We hear what sounds like a child's hand playing the song

"Here, There and Everywhere..."

INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - EVENING

We see SAM sitting at Lucy's miniature toy piano as he plays

with one finger.  IN A SERIES OF DISSOLVES, as DAYS and WEEKS

PASS, we see SAM'S HANDS at the PIANO -

EXT. CARPENTER HOUSE - DAY

With Lucy and Randy's hands as they PAINT side by side to

Sam's sad melody.  Lucy's pictures start ANGRY, angular with

blacks and blues, then GRADUALLY soften and the dark figures

recede.  By the END, there is a BRUSHSTROKE of the red of

Randy's smock peeking into the corner of Lucy's picture.

INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - DAY

We come back to Sam, having withdrawn completely into himself

serenading no one.

INT. LUCY'S BEDROOM - DAY

We see Lucy and Randy sitting on her bed unwrapping the

birthday presents.  TIME HAS PASSED.  They look close, almost

like a mother and daughter.  Lucy finishes unwrapping Sam's

present and we see a stack of ONE HUNDRED DENNY'S NAPKINS.

Randy picks up one of Lucy's pictures and moves to the wall.

Lucy half-smiles and unconsciously begins to fold one of the

Denny's napkins into an origami bird.  Then crushes it.  Then

cautiously:

ON RANDY

Moved herself.  Understanding how huge a question this is

coming from this bruised little heart.

INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - WEEKS LATER - DAY

Sam sits in a dark corner; maniacally folding newspaper into

an odd origami pattern.  There's a knock at the door - Sam

doesn't move, he just continues folding his paper.

He doesn't answer it, just methodically folds.

EXT. SAM'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Rita stands there impatiently.

She starts down the hall when suddenly she turns and - with

the mastery of a karate black belt - RUNS AND KICKS the door

down.

INT. SAM'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Rita bursts through the door and then stops.  Sam has created

an origami wall of newspapers, intricately woven together.

A fortress against the world.  He keeps folding - doesn't

even look at Rita.  He's more far gone than she could

imagine, she walks gingerly to the wall and knocks gently on

it.

He pulls out one small brick of origami, opening a window.

Sam looks at her through the window.  A CHINK in the wall.

She slaps him.  STUNNED, he slaps her back.  STUNNED, she

slaps him again.  HE SLAPS HER.  She rips the newspaper wall

down.

She's crying too hard to continue.  He pulls her to him.

Before she realizes what's happening, she's holding him

tightly.  He whispers in her ear.

He looks her straight in the eye - she's undone by the

intimacy of the moment, by the strength of his purity.  And

staring into his eyes, she begins to sob, walls crumbling.

He kisses her elbow, her shoulder, her forehead, her eyes,

her tears.  And something ignites between them - something

confused and scary and deep and filled with a passionate

ache.

On a bed of newspaper that was once a wall they come

together, whole again.

EXT. RANDY'S NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

Sam rounds the corner walking - or rather being walked by SIX

DOGS, all shapes, all sizes.  He heads up the walkway to

Randy's house.  She comes out of the house and shuts the door

behind her, stopping him.

Sam hangs his head.  A dog barks at Randy.

All the dogs sit but a BIG BLACK LAB.  Randy heads into the

house.  The front door opens and Lucy comes out.  She runs

down the stares to Sam.  Thrilled, Sam opens his arms to her.

She leaps into them and begins slugging his chest with pent

up fury.

Lucy pulls away.  A long charged silence.  Lucy refusing to

even look at her father.

A BASSET HOUND SNEEZES.

The black lab has begun eating Randy's flowers.  Lucy stares

forward.  Sam speaks tentatively, carefully:

Lucy raises her head and looks at Sam for the first time.

INT. DENNY'S - DAY

ON SALAD BAR

Rows of carrots, tomatoes, cucumbers and - uh-oh, a tomato's

in the peas.  A hand comes into frame and carefully places

the tomato just so, in the tomato bin.  Now it moves to the

olives.  Shouldn't all the pimentos be facing up?

PULL BACK

To reveal Sam, in white apron and hat, deftly filling the

containers of the elaborate salad bar as people fill their

plates.

INT. COURTHOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

Sam walks toward the courtroom when we see Rita approaching

from the other end of the hall.  They both slow down when

they see each other.  Rita unconsciously fixes her hair.  Sam

adjusts his tie.

They almost shake hands - realize that means touching each

other and don't.  Rita motions toward the door.

They nervously walk through the door, bumping into each

other.

INT. SMALL COURT ROOM - LATER

She's very aware of Sam.  He looks away, over compensating

obviously.  Throughout the scene, Rita's hair falls in her

eyes.  She attempts to put it in place.

Rita's hair falls in her eyes again.  Sam stands up, pulls

HER BARRETTE from his pocket, the one she left at his house.

Rita stares at the barrette as if it were the murder weapon.

Sam turns to Rita.  This can't be happening.

INT. DENNY'S - NIGHT

Sam, Rita, Ifty, Robert and Brad sit in a booth.  With one

extra person, it's a little tight.  Rita picks at her

Salisbury Steak special, trying to deal with the business at

hand.

Too long a pause.  Ifty looks at the clock.

Devastated, Ifty, Robert and Brad solemnly gather their

things.

They leave in a huff.  The WAITRESS delivers the check with

dessert and coffee.

Long pause.  Rita slowly eats her pie.

Rita laughs and nods.

EXT. SCHOOL - DAY

Randy kisses Lucy goodbye as she heads toward school.  We

follow Lucy - suddenly a BIRD SAILS THROUGH THE SKY and LANDS

IN FRONT OF LUCY.  It's an ORIGAMI BIRD.  She looks around -

but doesn't see Sam anywhere.  But she feels him.  She walks

toward school, clutching the bird, past a tree and we move up

that tree and see Sam nestled in the branches.  There.  They

made contact.

EXT. RANDY'S NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

It's later that week.  Lucy walks proudly down the street in

a GIRL SCOUT UNIFORM, selling cookies.  Randy is by her side,

beaming.

EXT. RANDY'S NEIGHBORHOOD - LATER

DISSOLVE as they move through the neighborhood.  Finally we

see her bound up the steps to an apartment building.  She

knocks on the door.  It opens - and Lucy and Randy's JAW

DROPS.

REVERSE ANGLE

Sam stands there.  Holding three kittens.  WE see various

dogs in arm chairs, the couch...

Buster sneezes.

Randy watches with a mixture of jealousy and fear as Lucy

effortlessly enters her and Sam's universe.

EXT. CARPENTER HOUSE - DAY

From the window, Randy watches as Sam hands Lucy four leashes

and the two of them get pulled down the street by the dogs.

INT. LUCY'S BEDROOM - 2 A.M.

Lucy lies in her hammock, unable to sleep.  Staring at the

little origami bird on her window sill.  She moves it, opens

the window wide, quickly takes Mr. Jeeters - and within a

moment she's out the window and onto the limb of the tree.

EXT. MAIN THOROUGHFARE - NIGHT

"The night grows teeth..." stray dogs fight over garbage - a

wino talks to himself and in the midst of it all walks Lucy

in her pj's.  Mr. Jeeters tucked under her arm.  Lucy crosses

the street.  HONK!  the screeching of tires...

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

We're looking at an old fashioned fire escape when suddenly

we make out a figure climbing higher and higher.  It's Lucy.

We catch glimpses of her and then lose her as the neon sign

across the street blinks on and off.

INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Sam's asleep.  Suddenly his eyes open wide.  And like an

animal sensing danger, he gets up.  We HEAR THE SOUND of

something THUMPING AGAINST RUNG AFTER RUNG OF THE FIRE

ESCAPE.  He rushes to his window and looks to see --

EXT. SAM'S APARTMENT

Lucy climbing the fire escape!  Sam opens the window and

reaches for her.

EXT. RANDY'S STREET - NIGHT

Sam, in his pajamas, holds a sleeping Lucy in his arms.  He

turns a corner and heads up the walkway to Randy's house.  He

knocks on the door.  Finally the door opens and we see Randy

and Bill in their pajamas SHOCKED at seeing Sam and Lucy.

Randy and BILL, her husband, watch as Sam turns and walks

purposely down the walkway - his houseslippers scuffling on

the quiet street.

SERIES OF SHOTS AT 3:00 A.M. --

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Lucy in her pj's walks down the middle of the street.

EXT. SAM'S WINDOW - NIGHT

Lucy knocks on Sam's window.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Lucy and Sam walk back down the street to Randy's house.

EXT. SAM'S WINDOW - NIGHT

Lucy lugs encyclopedias to Sam's windowsill.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Lucy in a blanket being carried by Sam toward Randy's house.

INT. LUCY'S ROOM - NIGHT

Until FINALLY, we see Lucy in her hammock at Randy's house

looking out the windows, which have now been completely

covered with BARS.  Her room is filled with origami birds

from the 100 Denny's napkins, her birthday gift.  Lucy gets

out of her hammock and tiptoes across her room - quietly

opening the door.

INT. CARPENTER HOUSE - STAIRS TO LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

We follow her through the dark house as she creeps down the

stairs.  She gets to the front door.  It's been DEAD BOLTED

where she cannot reach it.  From the darkness we hear --

Randy sits in the darkness, next to a THIRD OF A GLASS OF

MILK and a HALF A DENNY'S BLUEBERRY MUFFIN.

Lucy stares at the muffin and milk.  Torn.

Lucy nods.  Elated, Randy makes room for her on the couch.

But Lucy just reaches for the milk and muffin and heads up

the stairs then turns back and speaks gently to Randy.

INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - DAY

We PAN ACROSS THE ROOM and see Sam's shoes, his tie, and a

YELLOW PAD WITH ALL THE PRESIDENTS LISTED IN ORDER.  A KNOCK

at the door - Sam opens it to see Rita standing there,

looking intensely vulnerable, holding her husband's suit.

For a moment, Rita's mask drops and her fear for Sam

overwhelms her.

INT. RANDY AND BILL'S BEDROOM - 2 A.M.

Randy and Bill are asleep when Randy senses something.  She

opens her eyes and sees Lucy staring at her.

INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - 3:30 A.M.

We see Sam sleeping in bed.  There's a KNOCK at the door.

Sam wakes with a start, throws down the covers.

We see that he's wearing the Armani suit.  Sam opens the door

to see Randy standing there, holding a sleeping Lucy in her

arms.

Sam looks at Randy with profound compassion.

Randy nods and hands the sleeping Lucy into Sam's strong

arms.  For a moment they BOTH HOLD LUCY between them in the

most unique embrace.  Randy finally lets go and struggles to

say goodbye.

Randy walks away.  Stunned, Sam watches her, holding Lucy in

his arms.  Then, from a very brave place:

ON RANDY

So unexpectedly bonded to them both.

EXT. SOCCER FIELD - DAY

A glorious sunny day.  Lucy and her team are in the middle of

a fierce game.  A foul is called when we hear -

Sam, wearing a UNIFORM and whistle around his neck, walking

his inimitable walk, races up the field, COACHING THE TEAM.

Ifty, Robert and Brad sit in the bleachers.  Robert, in

sunglasses, paranoid, looking behind him.  Brad follows

around an attractive YOUNG WOMAN as close as he can get to

her.  Sam runs by the water stand, manned by Randy and Bill.

They share a look - a moment of intense parental pride.  Lucy

and a kid named PHILLIP go after the ball.

Phillip steps in front of Lucy and shoves her as hard as he

can.  Sam blows his whistle repeatedly and races over.

It's RITA!  With Danny - hollering from the stands.

ON LUCY

Looks over at her father.  Sam does every coaching gesture,

and referee hand signal from every sport known to man.  It

looks like a bizarre TWYLA THARP DANCE.

ON LUCY

She does it right back at him.  Their secret code.  The code

that will bind them for the rest of their lives.

ON THE CROWD AND PLAYERS

All watching.  What the hell was that?  Sam blows his

whistle.

The game heats up.  Lucy's team gets the ball and is headed

toward the goal.  Sam is running right alongside them, so

excited, until he can't hold himself back anymore and

intercepts the ball!  Sam runs valiantly down the field with

it!  We hear "Here Comes the Sun"...

Little darlin', it's been a long, cold lonely winter.  Little

darlin', it feels like years since you've been here.  Here

comes the Sun...Here comes the sun...And I say, "It's

alright..."

And the CREDITS ROLL.
