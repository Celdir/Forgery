FADE IN:

INT.  SENATE HEARING ROOM - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY

Blinding in their white uniforms, naval flag officers sit

in the audience, showing their support for THEODORE HAYES,

a 50-year-old civilian.  This is his confirmation hearing.

Reading from prepared material:

At the center of a dais, LILLIAN DEHAVEN leans back to

ponder the ceiling of the hearing room.  Her plaque card

reads "CHAIRPERSON -- SENATE ARMS COMMITTEE." DeHaven is a

tough-hided old Southern belle, Scarlett O'Hara at 60.

In her arsenal she carries conversational hand-grenades --

and she's apt to pull a pin at the slightest whim.

CHUCKLES from the packed gallery.  The flag officers go

stone-faced.  Hayes forces a smile.

On cue, aides begin distributing reports to other members

of the dais.  Hayes gets a copy, too.  And it jars him.

A humorless smile.  She's roasting his nuts over an open

fire, and everyone knows it.

INT.  CORRIDOR - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY

Heading for her office, DeHaven is escorted by a small

PRESS RETINUE.

DEHAVEN'S AIDE catches up, pulls her aside.

INT.  DEHAVEN'S OFFICE - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY

Shoes dumped on her desk, DeHaven changes out knee-high

stockings while devoting one ear to...

A beat.  DeHaven looks between the two WHITE HOUSE boys --

#1 young and eager, #2 older and cagier.

White House #1 looks spanked.  Taking over, #2 pops a

briefcase.  An inch-think report appears before DeHaven.

Surprised -- maybe even startled -- DeHaven flips through

the report, absorbing by osmosis.

DeHaven riffles the edges of the report, thinking it over.

Thinking light years ahead.

EXT.  CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY

Buttoning up topcoats, the White House boys move down

marble steps to reach a pair of limousines.  Hayes and two

FLAG OFFICERS wait.

INT.  HAYES' LIMOUSINE - DAY

Inside the moving car:

EXT.  POTOMAC RIVER - WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY

Winterscape:  Dotted with ice floes, the Potomac wends

through the capitol city, banks iridescent with snow,

morning water calm.  There's an almost hallowed beauty to

it all.  Soon we pick out...

A spot of day-glo.  Coming out of the mouth of morning.

Overtaking the floes.

CLOSER on JORDAN O'NEIL.  She pushes her flat-water kayak

downriver, paddling hard and clean, making good time.

Gliding through the graceful arches of the Arlington

bridge, she passes...

Cars overhead.  Grid-locked by snow conditions.

In seconds Jordan paddles clear, leaving the traffic

behind as she heads toward the Washington Monument.

Something BURRS from a life-vest pocket.  She rips through

velcro to free a cell phone.

INT.  SITUATION ROOM - N.I.C. - DAY

A TACTICAL OFFICER reroutes the call via defense

satellite, cryptography flashing on terminals.  Lieutenant

Commander ROBERT ROYCE joins other Intel officers at a

conference table.  They're pouring over weather charts,

navigation logs, high-altitude NRO video.

EXT.  POTOMAC RIVER - WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY

Riding the current, Jordan blows a troubled sigh as she

accesses the file of her brain.  Drifting past the

Jefferson Memorial:

INTERCUTTING:

A dubious beat.

Silence on the radio:  They're discussing her scenario

privately.  During, Jordan's kayak reaches the junction of

the Potomac and the Anacostia rivers.  On the far bank

lies...

Naval Intel Center (N.I.C.), bristling with communication

antennae.

Jordan stares at the complex, waiting for a response.

The phone goes dead.

EXT.  SECURITY STATION - N.I.C. - DAY

Bundled in topcoat and scarves, military and civilian

employees transit a security station on their way inside.

Presently Jordan appears -- wearing a wetsuit and

balancing a collapsed kayak on her head.  She flashes a

photo-badge and double-times inside.

INT.  CORRIDOR - N.I.C. - DAY

Jordan exits a locker room.  Smoothing out her Khaki

uniform, she heads down a broad corridor with cipher-lock

doors.  Falling in step:

Now they reach...

INT.  BULLPEN - N.I.C. - DAY

A circular chamber.  Dominating the ground floor is the

bullpen, a hive of cubicles an computer stations.  On the

second floor are executive offices, ringing the bullpen.

On the upper walkway, a frazzled N.I.C. SECRETARY

appears.  She spots Royce and Jordan below.

He bounds up the stairs toward his office.

Royce turns back and gives Jordan a hall-of-fame look.

"Oh, really?"

INT.  DEHAVEN'S OFFICE - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY

INT.  BULLPEN - N.I.C. - DAY

On the phone, Jordan glances around.  Co-workers mull

within earshot.  Those out of earshot post E-mail memos on

Jordan's computer:  "Moving up in life."  "I want a full

report."  "Don't tell her who you really voted for."

A beat as Jordan's mind catches up to her ears.  Now

INTERRCUTTING the two:

The line goes dead.  Jordan hangs up catatonically.

EXT.  GUNKHOLE HARBOR - POTOMAC - NIGHT

A small gunkhole harbor up the Potomac.  Snow falls thick

and silent on overturned canoes, stored for the winter.

Beyond stands a clapboard rental house.

INT.  JORDAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

It's not so much furnished as equipped -- scuba gear and

wetsuits in the mud room, life vests on coat racks, a

training bag and boxing gloves hanging in the living room.

In the kitchen we find...

A naked man.  He's steeping tea.

CAMERA FOLLOWS as the naked man carries a steaming mug

through the house...

INT.  BATHROOM - JORDAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

... and sets it down beside Jordan, languishing in a tub.

Snow builds on a window sill.  Facing Jordan, the man

slides into the tub.

Dutifully, Royce massages her feet.

Wounded, she gets out.

She punches into a robe and leaves.  Royce considers

drowning himself in the tub.

EXT.  CORONADO BRIDGE - SAN DIEGO - DAY

Jordan drives a top-down Mustang across the sweeping

Coronado Bridge, cityscape behind her, naval base ahead.

A flock of pelicans pace Jordan alongside the bridge.

Suddenly two NAVY HELOS BLAST overhead, scattering the

pelicans.

EXT.  THE GRINDER - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

On base, Jordan carries a gunnysack across an asphalt

courtyard.  The is "the grinder," reminiscent of a

gladiator's arena.  She notices at one end...

A silver ship's bell.  Hung prominently.

INT.  ADMINISTRATION - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

A DUTY OFFICER looks up to find Jordan across a counter.

In no particular hurry, the duty officer makes his way

over to check Jordan's orders.

Hearing, other workers look up.  Among them is a female

ensign, KATHY BLONDELL -- no makeup, no nail polish, no

concession to her sex.  Throughout, she'll watch Jordan

with more than passing interest.

The duty officer stamps her paperwork, returns it with

room assignment and keys.

It's a nasty little barb -- one that Jordan decides to let

slide.  Jordan turns for the door.  Blondell catches up

with a base map.

INT.  C.O.'S OFFICE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

A soft KNOCKING.

A YEOMAN opens the door.  Behind him is Jordan.

For a beat, COMMANDING OFFICER (C.O.) TURRENTINE takes

stock of the female in his doorway, sizing her up like a

fighter across the ring.  Then he stubs out a perfectly

good cigar, rises with an amiable face, and touches the

back of a chair -- stopping just short of pulling it out

for her.

More stock-taking.  Is he looking at her hair?

Another smile, another phantom gesture on the back of her

chair.  If Jordan was expecting a fight, the bell never

sounded.  She rises, salutes -- then turns back at the

door.

EXT.  B.O.Q. - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

The Spec-Recon TRAINEES loiter outside their open rooms,

pumping weights, hosing down dive gear, trading Walkman

tapes.  This is the last day of liberty they'll have for a

long time.

Other eyes quickly lock in on...

Jordan.  Across a grass courtyard, she walks the ground

floor of an identical building, trying to match key number

to room number.  Every door is open, every room empty.

Soon she feels the presence of...

The men.  They're disgorging from their rooms -- ten,

twenty, thirty of them -- all buffed and cut.  These guys

are what Hitler saw in his dreams.

Jordan picks up her pace.  Where the hell is her room?

On all three levels of their building, the men shadow

Jordan en masse.  Not hooting.  Not leering.  Just

assessing.

Jordan finds her room at the far corner of the building:

She's got the entire floor to herself.  With a last look

over her shoulder, Jordan vanishes inside.

EXT.  THE GRINDER - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

CAMERA SURVEYS faces of the trainees:  MILLER, MCCOOL,

SLUTNIK, CORTEZ, FLEA, STAMM, ENGLAND, NEWBERRY, WICKWIRE.

We'll get to know them later.  Dressed in Navy greens,

they stand in formation -- ten rows, ten deep, helmets in

hand.  Pacing before them:

He approaches Jordan.  We can tell what she's thinking.

"Just keep moving.  Don't single me out."

Jordan flinches.

Taking over, THE CHIEF stands before the class a moment,

sizing them up while giving them -- get an eyeload of him,

too:  His body is 30 years old, his face 40, his eyes 50.

An ageless warrior.  Somewhere, the blood of Ulysses runs

in this guy's veins.

The Chief lifts a bullhorn to deliver his opening salvo --

and it's anything but the kick-ass rant the class is

expecting:

Trainees swap private looks.

EXT.  BEACH - CORONADO NAVAL STATION - DAY

START on boots, crashing through shallow surf, spraying

water.  We assume this is a routine beach run -- until

VIEW RISES to reveal...

Telephone poles on their shoulder.  Working in groups of

10, trainees labor under 300-pound poles.  Jordan, six

inches shorter than most, looks like Atlas carrying the

weight of the world.  But she's doing it.

An ambulance shadows the class.  Perched on the front

bumper like an hood-ornament, the Chief keeps working his

bullhorn:

It's also intimidating shit.

The earth literally shakes as the phone poles hit the damp

sand.  Approaching on foot, the Chief loads fresh

batteries into his bullhorn.  He does it like a man

thumbing rounds into a shotgun.

He passes right by Jordan, never meeting her eyes.

INSTRUCTOR PYRO steps up.  He's the Chief's bulldog.

The guys strip down to boxers.  Jordan settles for boxers

and jog bra.

The class wades in.  The first wave takes Jordan's breath

away:  It's February, and the water is cold.  When they

move out of instructors' earshot:

Some of the guys are glancing Jordan's way, cashing in on

a cheap wet T-shirt contest.  Jordan covers herself

instinctively -- and hates the instinct.  Modesty isn't

going to get her through this.

The class breaks for the beach.

The trainees hit their bellies and roll.  Indeed, they

look like sugar cookies.

Groaning, the trainees grab poles.  Jordan's pole, wet

slips from their collective grasp...

And bangs Stamm's ankle.  He HOWLS through his teeth.

Stamm swallows the pain.  Poles go back on shoulders.

Looking like drunk centipedes, the class staggers off down

the beach.

EXT.  MUD PIT - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

Wallowing in mud, the class does belly-busters, atomic

sit-ups -- and the sadistic reverse push-up, where

trainees lie of their backs, place hands under shoulder

blades and push their crotches skyward.

Instructors roam, RASPING ORDERS, kicking students into

proper position.  Jordan struggles with the reverses.

She looks around.  A lot of the guys are having trouble

with the reverses, not just her.

She switches to standard push-ups, her face disappearing

into the ooze with every downstroke.  Soon the Chief's

boots slosh into FRAME.  He's still looking for his human

sacrifice.

EXT.  BEACH - CORONADO NAVAL STATION - SUNSET

Whistle-drills.  Silhouetted against a lowering sun, the

students flop around like docked fish.

INT.  ADMINISTRATION - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT

Blondell is ending her shift.  She shoulders a purse and

pauses at a window, seeing...

The trainees shuffling into formation like the living

dead.  Jordan is still among them.

EXT.  THE GRINDER - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT

Nervous eyes flick to the bell.

He turns his back to the class.

CAMERA SEARCHES their faces.  There isn't one trainee here

who hasn't thought about it.  Including Jordan.

Following the Chief's lead, Instructors lift their dive

watches.

GROANS behind him.  The groans give way to the SOUND OF

BOOTS breaking rank.

INT.  ADMINISTRATION - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT

BLONDELL'S POV:  Of a lone figure crossing to the bell.

EXT.  GRINDER - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT

QUICK CLOSEUPS of Miller, Slutnik, Wickwire, turning to

watch someone cross the grinder.  At least we know who it

isn't.

CLOSE on the Chief as the BELL RINGS THREE TIMES.  He

turns around to find...

Stamm at the bell.

For the first time, the Chief looks dead-bang at Jordan.

Was he expecting her?

Stamm drops his helmet and limps away.

They march off.

INT.  MESS HALL - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT

Dead-ass tired, Jordan slides her tray down the line,

piling on food that means nothing more than raw calories.

She heads for...

A table of trainees, one spot open.  Seeing her coming,

the guys shift position.  Suddenly the table is full.

Jordan glares.  None of them meet her eyes.  She wheels

around -- and now all eyes are on her, watching her ass

walk away.  FEATURE Slutnik, the walking sperm bank.

Jordan tries another table.  This one, too, becomes

abruptly full.  As Jordan leaves, HOLD on Miller.  He's a

human eclipse -- six-three, 220, the perfect commando

physique.  Instructors wish they could clone him.

After wandering the mess hall like a homeless person,

Jordan finds refuge at a table with female mess stewards.

They look at her with blank faces.  No understanding.  No

compassion.

EXT.  B.O.Q. - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT

Jordan walks in a bathrobe, toweling her hair dry.  She

fishes for keys at her door.

Jordan looks.  Someone is sitting on an outdoor table,

smoking.  He leans into the light so she can see his face.

It's Wickwire, the mid-30s lieutenant who doubles as class

officer.  He's dangerously handsome.

A faint grin from Wickwire before he shadows back across

the courtyard that separates the two B.O.Q. buildings.

Back across no-man's land.

INT.  JORDAN'S B.O.Q. - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT

Two beds.  Matching lockers.  A desk, a chair, a mirror.

All overwhelmingly dull.

Jordan drops the robe off her shoulders to take inventory

of her body.  Both sides of her neck are bruised from the

phone-pole run.  Her back and thighs are sand-burned.

Mirror cuts abound.  She's already a mess.

Jordan uncaps some cologne.  It's a vestige of her old

life she's not going to surrender.  She sniffs.  Savors.

Dabs.  Looks back in the mirror...

And breaks out laughing.  It's like dropping a rose in a

cesspool.

EXT.  SILVER STRAND HIGHWAY - CORONADO - DAY

A PHOTOGRAPHER stands near a car parked just outside the

base.  He's peering through a 600mm lens.

PHOTOGRAPHER'S POV:  FOCUSING through cyclone fencing...

PANNING past the sand dunes... and finding green-clad

trainees gathered at an obstacle course.

EXT.  OBSTACLE COURSE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

An explosion of sand:  England and Wickwire belly-flop

into a sand pit and speed-crawl under barbed wire.  Clear,

they gain their feet and blitz toward...

The rolling logs.  They balance-beam their way to...

The rope climb.  Racing to the top, they reach a platform

and fling themselves down onto...

The high poles.  They land awkwardly, losing their wind

and their grip, tumbling into the sand pit below before...

Racing for the finish.  The Chief thumbs a stopwatch.

Wickwire dusts off and starts back for...

The starting line.  Stepping up next is Cortez, the human

fighting cock.  Jordan lines up beside him and psyches up

for the first obstacle -- and eight-foot sheer wall.

He grabs something off a truck and positions it at the

base of the wall.  It's a little two-step platform.

SNICKERS, MOANS from the guys.  Cortez can barely contain

his disgust.

Cortez blurs away.  Jordan starts a step late.

Cortez takes the wall clean.  Eschewing the two-step,

Jordan jumps right over it -- but jumps too far out

because of it.  She takes the wall awkwardly.

INTERCUT the others as they break rank to follow, eager to

see Cortez blow her off the course.

Cortez belly-flops into the sand pit -- and snags going

under the barbed wire.

Catching up, Jordan clears the wire without a hitch and

leads going into...

The rolling logs.  They both tight-rope across nimbly and

bound on toward...

Rope climb.  Jordan starts up at a decent clip -- but

Cortez comes from behind like a chimp on white sugar,

doubling her speed.

Cortez reaches the top platform.  Now he's faced with...

The high poles.  He's seen others land sideways and pay

the price.  Trying another way, Cortez takes a flying

leap...

And WHUMPS down with legs astraddle.  He tried to cushion

the landing with his hands -- and failed magnificently.

His balls took the brunt.

Jordan WHUMPS down beside him with legs astraddle -- and

shoots Cortez a "Hey, no problem" look.  She rolls off the

poles...

And drops to the pit below.  Cortez lands right behind.

Now it's a flat-out sprint for...

The finish line.  He takes her at the tape.

Heading back to the starting line, Jordan wheels around.

Others GRUMBLE in commiseration.  Jordan flushes with

anger.

He turns his back, leaving no possibility of discussion.

Jordan stares after.

EXT.  B.O.Q. - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT

Dressed in bathrobe, Jordan reaches her door.  She pauses

to check...

The outdoor table.  No visitors tonight.

INT.  JORDAN'S B.O.Q. - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT

Jordan pushes inside -- and stops when she sees the little

two-step platform.  That awful crutch.  Someone has put it

beside her bed.

Jordan wheels around to check...

EXT.  B.O.Q. - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT

The men' building.  Slutnik and a few others loiter on a

balcony, mirroring her stare.

EXT.  CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT

Hastily dressed, Jordan marches across the base.  Her

march turns into an angry run as she cuts through parking

lots... jumps hedges... and finally reaches...

EXT.  C.O.'S HOUSE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT

An on-base bungalow.  Jordan bangs on the front door until

the C.O.'S scowling face appears.

He waves her inside.

INT.  C.O.'S HOUSE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT

Now, finally, her opponent steps into the ring.  And he's

a bare-knuckle brawler.

A dangerous beat -- before the C.O. disengages.

A deciding beat.

INT.  BARBER SHOP - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

Jordan gets her hair cut to regulation length.  It's over

in seconds.

INT.  ADMINISTRATION - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

Jordan slaps down old room keys and new orders.  Blondell

scans the paperwork with deepening concern.

INT.  JORDAN'S B.O.Q. - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

Jordan tosses her belongings into a laundry bag.  She

slings the bag over her shoulder, boots aside the hated

two-step on her way out...

EXT.  B.O.Q. BUILDING - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

... marches across the no-man's land...

INT.  B.O.Q. ROOM - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

... and bangs open a door.  Slutnik sits up on his bed.

Slutnik's face curdles.  Jordan dumps her bag on an open

bunk and starts unpacking.

She slaps orders on his chest, continues to unpack.

Slutnik stalks out.  Jordan fires a look at the innocent

bystander here, McCool.  He was studying at his desk when

the fireworks began.

McCool -- an imperturbable black lieutenant -- just goes

back to his manuals.

EXT.  OCEAN - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT

START on flares igniting overhead.  FOLLOW the flares as

they parachute down into the surf to illuminate...

The class, standing in one long line, arms linked.  As

black waves knock out their legs, we're reminded of show

girls kicking their way through some macabre review.

EXT.  BEACH - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT

Firing flare guns and working their bullhorns:

INTERCUTTING trainees and instructors:

The class pivots 90 degrees and starts to close rank.

Behind Jordan, Montgomery (a.k.a. "Flea") hesitates:

He's a bantam-weight from Georgia, his manners bred into

the bone.  He just can't find a delicate way to grab

Jordan without mounting her.

Finally Jordan grabs Flea by the neck, pushes him ahead

and mounts him.  The class closes down into a long human

snake.

CAMERA POLLS the grim, blue-lipped faces in the water.

Jordan feels Flea starting to shake.  Badly.

Two bodies ahead, it's the big bruiser, Miller, who's

shuddering.  Jordan feels him shaking through Flea.

No answer.  Bad sign.  On shore:

Ignoring, the Chief lifts his bullhorn:

A portable light comes on.  Indeed, an instructor is

setting up coffee service.

Suddenly the line rips apart.  It's Miller, breaking for

shore.

Soon the dyke is bursting everywhere:  Four others break

rank, following Miller's lead.

The deserters stagger onto the beach.  MEDICS close in

quick, draping them with blankets, shining flashlights in

their faces, asking brain-check question.

A medic nods to the Chief.  No hypothermia.  Not yet.

Avoiding his eyes, Miller wags his head.

It's a death sentence.  As the quitters slouch for the

coffee truck...

TIGHT on the Chief.  Scanning the remaining trainees.

Thinking about holding out out for one more.

TIGHT on Jordan.  Knowing who he's waiting for.  Wondering

if she can outlast him.

With a SHIVERING CHEER, the trainees stampede ashore,

grabbing blankets, trading body-bumps and high-fives.

Jordan gets swept up in the esprit:  They've conquered a

common enemy.  But when she tries to get high-fived...

The guys turn their backs.  It's a cold rebuff, worse then

any water.

HOLD TIGHT on Jordan.  Shivering.  Watching the guys drift

away.  Hating them.

INT.  INSTRUCTOR'S OFFICE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

The instructors are shuffling muster lists, reorganizing

the class.  B.G., the BELL TOLLS again and again.

EXT.  GRINDER - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

Blondell crosses the grinder with another female ensign,

tall and striking.  Passing the bell, Blondell checks

on...

The helmets lined up beneath.  A dozen already.

An O.S. CADENCE CALL -- then, led by Wickwire, trainees

double-time into the grinder, uniforms drenched from a

beach run.  Among them, still, is Jordan.  It brings a

Mona Lisa smile to Blondell's face.

The class scatters.  Slutnik hits the brakes when he sees

Blondell and her friend.

Overhearing, Jordan snaps a look at Blondell, only now

realizing.  Their eyes meet.

INT.  C.O.'S OFFICE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

The P.R. FLAK drops the newspaper on the C.O.'s desk.

It's the San Diego Tribune.  Under the headline "G.I.

JANE," a photo shows a chesty sailor running the obstacle

course.

The C.O. gets an instant headache.

INT.  SENATE BARBER SHOP - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY

In the Senate barber shop, DeHaven is having her hair

colored.  She holds a fax of the Tribune article in one

hand, a cell phone in the other.

INTERRCUTTING:

INT.  C.O.'S OFFICE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

The C.O. double-takes as Jordan enters:  She's sun-burned,

wind-burned, sand-burned, chapped and chaffed, bloody and

soggy.  Her dive suit leaks onto the floor.

He tosses her the paper.  Jordan scans the article as

DeHaven continues over speakerphone:

Deafening silence.  We aren't sure who dreads the idea

more -- the C.O. or Jordan.

Phone goes dead.  The C.O. gives Jordan a look one might

reserve for a lab technician who inadvertently unleashed

Ebola upon the world.

The C.O.'s headache becomes a migraine.

INT.  SENATE BARBER SHOP - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY

DeHaven hands the phone to her aide.  He's set up a

portable office in the next barber chair.

EXT.  BEACH - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

150-pound rubber boats ("Zodiacs") litter the beach.  The

class is breaking down into six-man crews.

Crew Five finds their Zodiac, hoists it onto their heads.

Jordan rolls her eyes:  At least two of the guys in her

crew are blue-ribbon misogynists.  Cortez and Slutnik

don't like it any better.

Exchanging looks across their Zodiac, Jordan and her new

crewmates lift the boat overhead.

EXT.  BEACH - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

With BATTLE CRIES, 12 boat crews charge into the teeth of

the POUNDING SURF.  Some lose their boat to the first

wave; others clear the surf and scramble aboard.

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

Beyond the breakers, the Zodiacs run parallel to shore,

crews paddling furiously, racing the wind, the sun, the

other crews.  Instructors shadow in power boats,

stopwatches running.

EXT.  BOAT SIX - OCEAN - DAY

Flea checks on Jordan.  She paddles hard, really digging

in.  Flea grins:  On some level, he has to admire this

women.

Jordan catches the grin, gives one back.

Ahead, buoys mark the finish line.  And just when it seems

victory is at hand...

THWUNK.  Something hits Boat Six.  Suddenly it's losing

air.  Jordan torques around to see...

The Chief on a nearby boat, speargun in hand.

They flail to save their sinking boat.  Boat Five noses

past, stealing the lead.  Wickwire tosses Jordan a passing

look.  "Sorry, but..."

EXT.  UPPER DUNES - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT

Up and down the dunes, crews are digging "hide-sites" --

six-man holes that will be their homes tonight.  Cortez

and Slutnik are uprooting shrubs, collecting camouflage

material.

EXT.  UPPER DUNES - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT

Jordan and Flea fill sand bags to shore up the walls of

their hide-site.  England and McCool shovel back to back.

Jordan jumps in the hole, ready to take over shoveling.

He climbs out.  HOLD on Jordan, looking off down the

dunes, seeing the other crews covering up and going

underground for the night.  How the hell did she wind up

here?  So far from home?

EXT.  SILVER STRAND HIGHWAY - DAY

A Jeep speeds along the public highway, carrying the C.O.

back to base.  When the Jeep tops a rise:

Ahead, a half-dozen news crews are camped on the shoulder.

All cameras are trained on the base.

INT.  BEDROOM - GEORGETOWN APARTMENT - NIGHT

CAMERA FINDS Navy dress blues laid out on a bed... topcoat

draped on a chair-back... CNN on a television.

Half-shaven, Royce leans out of the bathroom in time to

catch...

Footage from Coronado:  A woman in Navy greens is on a

beach run, loaded down with backpack and M-16.  The NEWS

FOOTAGE ZOOMS IN, FREEZE FRAMES with the indelible image

that will be used over and over in coming weeks:  Woman

cradling rifle.  Madonna for the 21st century.

Royce snaps it off.  He can't take anymore.

INT.  BEAU-ART HALL - WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT

Beneath the coffered ceiling of a great Beau-Art hall, one

of Washington's power-tribes is celebrating.  We find

gowned women, tuxedoed men, gold-braided naval officers, a

SWING BAND, and...

Secretary Hayes, newly confirmed.  He beams as he dances

with his wife.  Compliments and friendly barbs come from

all directions:

BRAYS of laughter.

INT.  BEAU-ART HALL - WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT

Royce, EXCUSING his way through the crowd, fixating on the

bar, leading his DIAL-A-DATE winner by the hand.

Conversations drift into earshot:

Royce can't get away from it.

Just yards from the bar, a Pentagon E-RINGER snags Royce's

elbow.

The E-Ringer turns to make introductions -- but finds his

CIRCLE OF FRIENDS embroiled in the topic du jour:

Eyes drift to Royce, inviting him into the fray.

INT.  MEZZANINE - BEAU-ART HALL - NIGHT

Heading upstairs with an iceless rum.  Royce finds a calm

and secluded place to get drunk in peace and quiet.

Royce frowns:  He thought he was alone.  He tracks the

voices to a forced-air vent beside the chaise.

Alarms go off in Royce's head.  He moves quickly to a

railing, looks down.

ROYCE'S POV:  Of two naval officers on the floor below.

They stand beside a matching vent.  It's impossible to see

faces from this angle -- but one man has a distinct bald

spot.

A conspiratorial handshake.  The men split up.

INT.  BEAU-ART HALL - WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT

Royce flashes down the stairs.  Hitting main floor, he

looks around and then bumps into...

Over her shoulder, Royce spies Bald Spot heading for the

cloak room.  Royce commandeers the nearest J.O.

INT.  BEAU-ART HALL - WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT

Royce bobs and weaves through the crowd, trying to keep

sight of...

Bald Spot.  Pushing through the exit doors.

Only steps behind, Royce shoulders through the doors...

EXT.  BEAU-ART HALL - WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT

And blasts outside, intending to shake some answers out of

Bald Spot.  But here Royce finds...

A dozen naval officers waiting for their cars.  All of

them now wear caps.

Royce tries to check faces of the quickly departing men.

but it could have been anyone.

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

A high-speed transport ("Seafox") is SLAMMING OVER SWELLS.

Lashed to one side is a rubber life boat.

EXT.  SEAFOX - OCEAN - DAY

England's crew lines up for cast-and-recover drills:  One

by one, they speed-roll off the transport...

... and drop into the life boat.  After quickly

stabilizing, they roll off the life boat...

... and disappear underwater like human bullets.  England

is last to cast off.

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

Jordan resurfaces.  Treading water, she scans for...

Seafox.  It makes a hard turn in the water and starts

back.  The recovery rig -- a big flexible loop -- is

lowered into position.

Still hauling ass, Seafox picks up the trainees in reverse

order -- England, Slutnik, Cortez.  They each stab an arm

through the passing loop...

EXT.  SEAFOX - OCEAN - DAY

... and vault back aboard, slick as hell.

But now they're bearing down fast on...

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

Jordan.  She braces as best she can.  As SEAFOX THUNDERS

past, she stabs for the loop...

And snags it with her hand.  But only her hand.

Hanging on grimly, Jordan drags face down in torrential

water.  Her mouth gropes for clean air but can't find it.

If she doesn't let go soon, she'll drown.

EXT.  SEAFOX - OCEAN - DAY

At the stern, the Chief spots Jordan bobbing up in the

boat's wake.

EXT.  OCEAN - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

COUGHING up water, Jordan watches Seafox speed on toward

McCool and Flea.  They make textbook recoveries.  She's

the only one who couldn't cut it.

INT.  WOMEN'S SHOWERS - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT

Head hung, Jordan showers alone.

Jordan recoils.  Christ, how long has he been there?  Just

standing in the doorway?

With forced calm, Jordan squeaks off the water and finds a

towel.

She can't say yes.  She wants to but can't.

She shoulders past.  The Chief gives her a few steps

before dropping his bomb:

INT.  ARTILLERY RANGE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

Trainees are getting familiar with M-60 machine guns,

firing SHORT BURST at downfield targets.

Jordan overhears them BITCHING.  She steps up to an open

slot -- and proceeds to WAIL AWAY with her M-60, tracer

rounds blazing.  Her target vaporized, she keeps WAILING

madly, taking out Slutnik's target... then Cortez's...

then...

Finally she stops.

Reloading, Jordan tosses a look at Slutnik and Cortez.

Ain't nobody bitchin' now.

EXT.  MESS HALL - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT

Eating at a table with other women, Jordan turns to see

Blondell setting down her tray.

EXT.  QUARTERDECK - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT

Walking across the base:

They laugh.

Reaching the quarterdeck, they scan a message board.

Jordan finds a half-dozen phone slips for her.

INT.  GEORGETOWN APARTMENT - NIGHT

EXT.  PHONE KIOSK - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT

Jordan sighs and slumps against the phone kiosk.  Where to

start?

INTERCUTTING Jordan and Royce:

Jordan's face sours with an errant thought.

EXT.  AIR STATION - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT

A HELO WARMS UP on its pad.

Crew Six approaches, garbed in black wetsuits, loaded down

with weapons and rucksacks.  Jordan is at the lead.

INT.  HELO - NIGHT

The helo is airborne.  Sitting on rucksacks, trainees

slather their faces with green camouflage paint.  Over the

HOWLING ROTORS:

Newberry is the new sixth man.  He's young enough to still

have a hyperactive Adam's apple.

EXT.  OCEAN - NIGHT

The helo swoops low over the water, moon silhouetting.

Black figures helo-cast into the ocean.

INT.  HELO - NIGHT

Last out, Jordan is poised to follow when...

Jordan looks back.  "What the hell does that mean?"

Offering no elaboration, Pyro signals "GO!"  Jordan

springs clear...

EXT.  OCEAN - NIGHT

... and knifes into black water.

The HELO PATTERS away.

An inky stillness overtakes the world.

Jordan activates a red-light beacon, sweeps it around,

revealing her position to...

Her crew.  Five black faces regroup around her.

They secure weapons atop their waterproof rucksacks.

Jordan checks a heat-bearing compass.

Pushing rucksacks ahead of them, they start swimming

towards...

A moonlit shoreline.  Half-mile ahead.

EXT.  ROCKY SHORELINE - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - NIGHT

Jordan's crew reaches shallow water.  They deflate their

vests and rucksacks.  Jordan trades her face mask for

night-vision goggles.

NIGHT-VISION POV:  Sweeping the rocks.  Nothing at first.

Then two "hostiles" appear, patrolling the rocks.

Jordan motions "down."  Six faces sink from sight.

NIGHT-VISION/UNDERWATER POV:  Of the "hostile" patrol

moving on.

They resurface.  On Jordan's cue, the crew sheds flippers

and begins scaling rocks.  They've made landfall.

EXT.  HIDE-SITE MONTAGE - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - NIGHT

MONTAGE:  Racing the coming sun, Jordan's crew builds

their hide-site... digging feverishly... filling sand

bags... telescoping open a roof pole, fanning out spars...

laying canvas roof panels into place... camouflaging the

panels... sprinkling sanitizing powder around the

perimeter to ward off animals.  INTERCUT WITH...

A snake slithering across the ground.  As it nears the

hide-site...

A knife whacks its head off.

Slutnik picks up the carcass, kicks dirt over the severed

head.  No trace.

EXT.  SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY

CAMERA PANS the island, awash in morning light.  Woodlands

lie distant.  A road is the only man-made feature -- until

in FOREGROUND, we find a spotting scope poking from the

ground.

INT.  HIDE-SITE - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY

SCOPE POV:  Of the road.  Fast-attack vehicles approach.

Jordan REPEATS THE INFO into a digital tape-recorder, adds

the time.

SCOPE POV:  Of the FAVs disappearing down the road.

Everyone relaxes -- as much as six people can in a hole

five feet-wide.  McCool opens up MREs (Meals Ready to Eat)

Slutnik guts his snake.

Cortez finishes pissing into a tin pot.  He transfers the

waste to a zip-lock baggy, offers the pot.

He looks at Jordan.  She eyes the pot, tempted and nettled

at the same time.

Abruptly Jordan unzips, drops her pants, sticks the pot

under her.  It raises eyebrows:  It's a far cry from when

she was covering up in cold water.

EXT.  SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY

WIDE VIEW:  As a lone figure appears on foot.

INT.  HIDE-SITE - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY

They pile up at McCool's scope.  Jordan bulls her way

through.

SCOPE POV:  It's a women.  Dressed in civilian clothes,

she collects firewood.  And she's coming this way.

McCool takes a second look.

SCOPE POV:  Of the women drawing closer... closer... and

finally looking dead-bang at us.  She does an about-face

and walks away.  Quickly.

He looks to Jordan.

Pleased, Cortez slips his rifle under a roof panel.

McCool doesn't.  Not for sure.

EXT.  ROAD - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY

The asphalt road shimmers with midday heat.  Suddenly a

TROOP CARRIER ROARS over a rise.

INT.  HIDE-SITE - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY

SCOPE POV:  Of the troop carrier braking hard.  "Hostiles"

spill out the rear -- and fan out all around us.

HOLD on Jordan, heart skipping.  Did she really make the

wrong call?

EXT.  SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY

They come out of the hide-site like atomic locusts,

splintering into three groups and laying down SUPPRESSIVE

FIRE as they blitz for...

The woodlands.

"Hostiles" FIRE and pursue.

Flea is running flat out when the ground vanishes beneath

him.  He goes down like a doped race horse.  Suddenly

exposed, another crew scrambles into daylight:  Flea ran

right over their hide-site.

Slutnik yanks Flea out, gets him back on his feet.

EXT.  WOODS - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY

Breathing like asthmatics, Jordan's crew regroups at the

link-up site just inside the woods.  Flea comes in

hobbling.  Badly.

A beat as Jordan deliberates.  She doesn't want to go out

like this.

EXT.  SKY - DAY

As a helo pirouettes in midair.

EXT.  WOODS - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY

Jordan's crew lopes through the woods, searching for a

place to bring the helo down.  Right on their heels...

ARTILLERY SIMULATORS THUMP-THUMP-THUMP, illumination

GRENADES POP and flare.  This may not be war, but it'll do

until the real thing comes along.

INT.  HELO - DAY

PILOT'S POV:  Buzzing treetops, searching.

EXT.  WOODS - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY

On the run:

Finally they break into a clearing.  Is it big enough?

Jordan chucks a smoke grenade.

INT.  HELO - DAY

PILOT'S POV:  Yellow smoke rises from the woods.  We swoop

toward it.

EXT.  CLEARING IN WOODS - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY

Whirling smoke, the helo descends.  Jordan's crew breaks

early, trying to get there the instant it touches down.

But before they can...

An FAV crashes through the underbrush, M-60s BARKING in

the helo's direction.  The helo bounds away.

Jordan's crew tries to retreat -- but a second FAV cuts

them off.

INT.  HELO - DAY

PILOT'S POV:  Of the action below, growing smaller and

smaller:  Jordan's crew.  Surrounded.  Laying down

weapons.  Captured.

EXT.  WOODS - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY

JORDAN'S POV:  Brush slapping her face.

Crew Six is being hauled through the woods, hands tied

back, boots around their necks, pulled along by...

The captors.  We assume they're instructors in camouflage

paint -- but we're moving so fast it's impossible to be

sure.

EXT.  P.O.W. CAMP - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY

A P.O.W. camp, disturbingly authentic.  A dozen trainees

are already here, held in pens of bamboo and barbed-wire.

Flea, McCool, Slutnik, Cortez, Newberry -- all five get

tossed into a pen.  Jordan is pulled away.

EXT.  BOXES - P.O.W. CAMP - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY

Jordan is thrown to the ground.  Her eyes go wide when she

sees a row of steel boxes nearby.  They're scarcely larger

then coffins.

INT.  BOX - P.O.W. CAMP - DAY

Hands push Jordan inside the box.  She has to curl up

fetally just to fit.

The LID BANGS closed.  A LOCK RATCHETS, FOOTSTEPS RETREAT.

Daylight sheets in through ventilation slats.

When her eyes adjust, Jordan finds markings on the lid and

walls.  Scratchings made with a nail.  The memoirs of

previous tenants.

EXT.  P.O.W. CAMP - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - NIGHT

As "hostiles" pull Flea out of the pen.

INT.  BOX - P.O.W. CAMP - NIGHT

A BANGING wakes Jordan.  Are they coming for her?  But

FOOTSTEPS LEAVE.  A GROAN from the adjacent box.

A beat.

Anything to get her mind off this box.  Out of this box.

Now INTERCUT Jordan and Wickwire, lying like fraternal

twins in their wombs of steel:

It hurts to think about it.  The Potomac.  The gunkhole

harbor.  Royce.

EXT.  NEWSSTAND - WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY

Royce stops for a newspaper.  As he pays, something else

catches his eye.  He picks up...

A "People" magazine.  The grainy image of "G.I. Jane"

fills the cover.  A photo inset, much clearer, shows a

beaming DeHaven.  "BEHIND EVERY GREAT WOMAN..."

INT.  CORRIDOR - N.I.C. - DAY

Reading as he walks, a former CIA spook looks up to find

Royce in lockstep.  It surprises him:  Not many people

here talk to him -- unless they're in trouble.  THE SPOOK

is physically unremarkable except for a face that would be

right at home on Easter Island:  This is a man who's seen

most of the world's ills -- and forgotten none.

INT.  SITUATION ROOM - N.I.C. - DAY

Royce and the Spook enter.  The vault-like door closes

emphatically.  Ensuring their privacy:

All around, screens go blank, phone lights extinguish.

They sit at the conference table.  No Computer.  No files.

Just two guys doing headwork.

Royce blinks.  "What's higher?"

INT.  BOX - P.O.W. CAMP - DAY

JORDAN'S POV:  The box opening.  Daylight assaulting us,

blowing out our eyes.  Disembodied hands pulling us out.

EXT.  P.O.W. CAMP - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY

Legs hobbled, uniform soiled, Jordan is led past a row of

huts.  She looks like she got hit by a train -- and got

back up.

JORDAN'S POV:  Vision still blown out.  But inside the

pen, we make out 40 trainees now.  One guy wrings out a

sock and drinks from it.

Jordan moves past huts.  VOLATILE VOICES spill out as

trainees get interrogated.

JORDAN'S POV:  Outside one hut, we see Flea.  At least we

think it's him:  Strapped face-down to a table, sobbing

quietly, he wears a slinky dress and whore's makeup.  They

broke him -- and it's an ugly, ugly sight.

INT.  INTERROGATION HUT - P.O.W. CAMP - DAY

Jordan seated.  Prowling the hut is her interrogator.  Her

tormentor.  Her chaperon through Hell.

It makes Jordan think -- and yes, it makes her afraid.

Continuing the psychological strip-search:

Jordan rubs her head.  So long ago.  How did the call come

down?

She stares a beat, knowing it's a loaded question.

With stunning ferocity, he grabs her by the neck, pushes

her out the door...

EXT.  P.O.W. CAMP - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY

... and throws her onto a table.

In the pens, all faces turn to watch.  Even instructors

stop what they're doing as...

The Chief pushes Jordan's head down and jams up behind

her.

He flips her over, rips off her belt, starts tearing open

her pants.

He covers her mouth -- her whole face -- with one hand.

In the pen:

The Chief jerks Jordan up, whirls her around like a dead

dance partner, slams her face-first into the pen to give

the guys a good look at what's happening to that pretty

face.

The men trade itchy looks.  Some do know.

The Chief throws her down like garbage.

The men shift anxiously.  Should they talk?  Behind the

Chief, Jordan staggers to her feet.

The Chief whirls, decks her a crescent-kick.  Instructors

lurch forward instinctively.

She licks her bloody teeth -- and considers kicking his

balls into his brainpan.  Instead she makes a move to get

up.  He grinds her back down with a crowbar forearm.

Pinning her down with just his eyes, he rises -- and

starts away.

Behind him, Jordan struggles to rise.

An ANXIOUS MURMUR races through the men:  They don't want

to see this.  They don't want to see her crucified.

Hearing, the Chief turns back to see...

Jordan wobbling to her feet.

Eye-lock.

TIGHT on the faces of her crewmates -- Slutnik, Cortez,

McCool.  In their eyes, a new respect.  The Chief see it.

Instructors see it.  Everyone does.

Beaten, he walks right out of camp.

Wordless, instructors open the pens, unlock the boxes.

Wickwire rises like a vampire in daylight.  But this time

he made it.

A medic tries to help Jordan, but she pushes him away,

walking drunkenly for...

Flea.  She begins wiping the makeup from his face.

EXT.  PIERS - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - SUNSET

The Chief chucks gear onto a transport boat.  FOOTSTEPS

approach.  He knows it's Pyro.

EXT.  STREET - WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY

As a limo moves -- heads for the Capitol building.

INT.  DEHAVEN'S LIMO - DAY

DeHaven snags a BUZZING PHONE.

The phone suddenly weights a ton, DeHaven dumps it on the

seat beside her.  HOLD on her disbelieving face.

INT.  CORRIDOR - PENTAGON - DAY

Hand-carrying a report, Flag Officer #1 hurries down a

corridor, pushes through a door.  HOLD on the door marker:

"Secretary of the Navy."

INT.  SECNAV OFFICE - PENTAGON - DAY

At his desk, Hayes scans the report with a deepening

frown.

The flags squirm.  Shaking his head, Hayes moves to a

window that offers a stunning view of Arlington National

Cemetery.

EXT.  GRINDER - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT

The bell.  It reflects the moon.  TILT DOWN to reveal a

new batch of helmets -- the casualties of S.E.R.E.  A

graveyard of its own.

EXT.  THE EXCHANGE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT

Jordan exits with purchases.  Her face is still bruised

from S.E.R.E.  With a minute to kill, she peruses a

bulletin board casually.  But a RAISED VOICE leads her

eyes to...

Wickwire.  At a phone kiosk, he hangs up emphatically.  He

looks flustered when he spots Jordan.

Catching up, Blondell exits the exchange.

She sees Wickwire.  An awkward beat for them all.

Jordan and Blondell head for the parking lot.  HOLD on

Wickwire, looking after them.  Thinking it through.

INT.  CLASSROOM - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

Charts are being passed around the room.  Every trainee

takes one, including Jordan.

A MILITARY COP fills the classroom doorway.  Frowning,

Johns joins the cop for a private discussion.

INT.  C.O.'S OUTER OFFICE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

Jordan enters.  The yeoman's desk is unattended.  Noticing

the X.O.'s door open, Jordan peers inside to find...

Blondell.  She looks scared out of her mind.  Before she

and Jordan can speak, the yeoman materializes.

INT.  C.O.'S OFFICE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

The C.O. and X.O. are both here.

The C.O.'s face remains grim.  He isn't relieved.

On the C.O.'s nod, the X.O. opens an adjoining office.

Wickwire enters.  He's stiff as a groom on a wedding cake.

Wickwire exits.

Jordan opens her mouth to confirm -- and hesitates,

realizing where this might be headed.  What the collateral

damage might be.

Jordan moves to the door.  Again she makes eye-contact

with Blondell.  Now we understand why she's so scared:

There's a witch-hunt brewing.

She's offering her own head on a silver platter -- and the

C.O. actually hesitates before answering.

EXT.  GRINDER - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

McCool and Flea exit a classroom with other trainees.

They spot Jordan approaching.

She passes them robotically.  Flea realizes where she's

going.

They lurch after her, grabbing her, stepping in her way.

McCool and Flea jerk to a stop:  The Chief has emerged

from the instructor's office.  Helpless, they watch as...

Jordan mounts the stairs to the bell... takes up the

baton... and HITS THE BELL like a tyko drummer.

RING ONE:  On the pained faces of her crewmates.

RING TWO:  On the Chief.  Taking no joy in it.  Just

accepting it as inevitable.

EXT.  THE QUARTERDECK - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

RING THREE:  On Wickwire as he walks across the base.  His

regrets are obvious.

FADE IN:

EXT.  UPRIVER - THE POTOMAC - DAY

The ice floes are gone.  The river banks are budding

green.  Soon CAMERA FINDS a power boat making its way

upriver.  A lone figure sits on the prow.

EXT.  POWER BOAT - DAY

It's Jordan.  Dressed in civvies, gunnysack between her

legs, she's back in Virginia with nothing more than what

she left with.  Around a river bend appears...

The gunkhole harbor.  Home.

EXT.  GUNKHOLE HARBOR - POTOMAC - DAY

The boat docks.  Jordan springs clear, waves a worn-out

thanks, starts up the dock.  But now she comes to a stop,

seeing...

Royce.  Stepping out of the house.

EXTREMELY WIDE:  River shimmering behind them, they meet

on the dock.  A charged stand-off:  Where do they pick up?

Can they pick up?  Then Jordan drops her gunnysack and

steps into his wide-spread arms.  Royce wraps her up as if

to never let go.

For the first time in this whole ordeal, Jordan begins

crying, sobbing uncontrollably.

INT.  COVERED PORCH - JORDAN'S HOUSE - SUNSET

An hour later.  Sharing a quiet moment, Jordan and Royce

cradle tea mugs while sitting on the rear porch that

overlooks the Potomac and a fiery sunset.

She looks at him sidelong.

INT.  LIVING ROOM - JORDAN'S HOUSE - DAY

CLOSE on multiple files being pulled out of a briefcase.

One contains clippings -- "G.I. Jane" photos, editorials,

political cartoons.  Another holds records of Coronado

personnel -- Jordan's crewmates, instructors, the base

brass.

She shakes her head, resisting.

Agitated, she walks away.  B.G., a PHONE RINGS until the

machine picks up.

UNDER DIALOG, we hear some of the INCOMING CALL:

A HANG-UP.  Something stirs in Jordan's memory.

We can see her mind gathering speed.  Royce switches files

quickly.

INT.  ADMINISTRATION - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

Answering a PHONE:

INT.  ADMINISTRATION - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

File in hand, Blondell returns to the phone.

She finds a crisp sheet of stationary, out of place among

the smeared government forms.

CLOSE on the stationary.  It bears an image of the Capitol

dome.

EXT.  CAPITOL BLDG. - WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY

The real Capitol dome.  A flag is being raised over the

Senate Wing.

EXT.  CAPITOL BDLG.  - WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY

A car parks at barricades.  Jordan and Royce emerge, both

in uniforms.

Not waiting for directions, Jordan takes the Capitol steps

two at a time.  We've seen this look on her face before --

and last time, she nearly knocked the grinder bell into

orbit.

INT.  CORRIDOR - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY

Jordan and Royce move quickly down a corridor, eyes

hunting, passing CAPITOL GUIDES and their tourists.  Soon

they find...

DeHaven's office.  A Navy captain exits with paperwork.

Hasty salutes.

The captain moves on.  Royce holds in the doorway a beat,

memory nagging him.  Again he looks at...

The captain.  He has a distinct bald spot.

Picking up where he left off a few weeks ago, Royce

follows Bald Spot around a corner...

INT.  PRIVATE STAIRCASE - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY

... down a private staircase...

INT.  ANOTHER CORRIDOR - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY

... and through a door marked "Naval Appropriation Liaison

Office."  It's not 30 seconds from DeHaven's door.

INT.  FOYER - DEHAVEN'S OFFICE - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY

In a side office, DeHaven's aide overhears.  He rises

quickly and enters the foyer.

A TOURIST pokes in.

Over the aide's shoulder, Jordan watches as...

The tourist claims tickets.  HOLD on the bureau near the

secretary's desk where the tickets are stored.

INT.  SENATE CHAMBER - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY

On the chamber floor, SENATORS mull about, consulting

aides, polling party mates.  PAGES place microphones and

fill the ceremonial snuff boxes, readying the room for

session.  Among the activity, we find...

DeHaven.  Caucusing with another Democrat.

DeHaven looks behind her.  Nobody.

Now she looks up to behold...

Jordan standing in the gallery.  Staring down on DeHaven

as she is, it's hard to read anything into her expression

but open disdain.

Drawn by Jordan's voice, a CAPITOL GUARD hurries down the

gallery steps.  Royce runs interference.

On the floor, half the U.S. Senate stops what it's doing

and looks up.

In the gallery, the guard is thrown off-balance by the

naval uniforms:  Do Royce and Jordan belong here or not?

Confused, he looks for guidance from...

DeHaven.  She notes C-SPAN cameras swinging Jordan's way.

Summoning a page:

INT.  CLOAK ROOM - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY

Towering doors swing open.  DeHaven appears, face pleasant

but harried.

About to hug Jordan, DeHaven stops awkwardly.

DeHaven glances back at the doors to the Senate chamber --

the open doors.  Walking Jordan a few steps away:

It's a threat DeHaven doesn't appreciate.  The Senate

DOORKEEPER appears.

Jordan shakes her head in disbelief.  She has met the

enemy -- and she is us.

Not happy about it, the doorkeeper reaches into an alcove,

grabs a broom he keeps around for just these occasions.

He enters the chamber...

INT.  SENATE CHAMBER - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY

... and moves behind the rostrum.  Holding the broom by

the bristles, the doorkeeper stands on tip-toes...

And uses the broom handle to turn back the Senate clock by

three minutes.

Senators GROAN.  It's an old trick played by senior

members -- and they all hate it when it happens to them.

INT.  CLOAK ROOM - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY

She flashes a winning smile and turns away.  As the

chamber doors start to close behind her:

The last image we have of DeHaven is her whirling back,

startled.  The DOORS BOOM CLOSED in her face.

EXT.  C.O.'S HOUSE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT

Through a window, we see the C.O. with a phone pressed to

his ear.  He stands at attention even though wearing a

bathrobe.  Half-audible through the glass:

INT.  C.O.'S HOUSE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT

The C.O. hangs up and looks to Jordan, heretofore unseen.

She waits anxiously.

EXT.  GRINDER - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

START on the helmet graveyard.  Hands enter FRAME to

reclaim one helmet in particular.  TILT UP on Jordan,

back in the grinder, back in Navy greens.

The Spec-Recon class is here.  Crewmates gawk like stone

idiots as Jordan takes her old place in the line-up.

CLOSE on Wickwire.  Feeling the heat.  Wondering if they

really know who it is.  Now the C.O. parks himself right

in Wickwire's face.

Wickwire breaks rank and heads for the bell.  He slows

when reaching Jordan, considering an apology he knows

would be inadequate.

He does.  As Wickwire RINGS OUT:

Eyes swing to Jordan.  Way ahead of them:

A CHORUS OF AYES.  Jordan puddles up.

On his way to the front, the Chief stops to check in with

Jordan.

EXT.  CORONADO BRIDGE - DAY

The morning sun is an orange ball balanced on the Coronado

Bridge.  In silhouette, pelicans circle, some dive-bombing

into the bay below.  Suddenly a HELO HOWLS across the sun,

scattering the birds as it heads off-shore.

INT.  HELO - DAY

Flea, McCool, Slutnik, Cortez, Newberry, Jordan.  Inside

the airborne helo, they synchronize their dive watches.

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

As the helo swoops down onto the ocean deck.

INT.  HELO - DAY

The trainees double-check wet gear and survival vests.  On

Jordan's nod, they push an inflatable life boat ("ILB") to

the helo door.  It's rolled up into a rubber log.

The HELO PILOT slows to five knots.  The Chief gives

Jordan the go-ahead nod.

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

The ILB splashes down into the ocean.  Jordan's crew helo-

casts in after it.

From the door of the circling helo, the Chief watches

as...

Jordan's crew swims to the ILB, bobbing in the swells.

Flea turns a handle on the CO2 tank meant to inflate the

boat.  Nothing happens.

Cortez tries to help.  The handle spins in his grip.

Jordan looks skyward.  100 feet overhead, the Chief gives

her a parting salute as the helo lifts away.

INT.  HELO - DAY

The helo turns into the morning sun.  PILOT and CO-PILOT

drop visors.

PILOT'S POV:  Of dots in the sun.  What the hell are try?

SMACK!  Something hits the windscreen, splattering red and

brown.

He starts to bank clear -- but not fast enough.

EXT.  HELO - DAY

More birds pepper-shot the helo:  One SHREDS through the

main rotor, another through the tail rotor.  Another bird

gets sucked right into...

The main turbine.

INT.  HELO - DAY

A SHARP BANG... a WICKED SHIMMY... and now they whole helo

loses power.

As the pilot wrestles controls, the co-pilot rigs for

auto-gyration.  But the bank they started is working

against them:  The helo is coming down badly, circling

like a huge steel feather.

Braced, the Chief looks out the side door -- and sees

ocean rushing up at him.  Fast.

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

Jordan whirls.  She's just in time to witness...

The helo hitting the water.  In seconds it's gone.

A stunned beat.  We never knew the ocean could be this

quiet.  When the anesthetic of shock wears off:

Cortez torques his wrench hard:  CO2 flows into the ILB,

inflating it.  The crew scrambles aboard.  Jordan digs

like a dog to find a radio.

Slutnik yanks a starter cord:  Their outboard MOTOR ROARS

to life.  The boat does a donut in the water and blasts

away.

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

The ILB powers over swells.  Flea is perched on the bow,

nose to the wind like a hunting dog.

Slutnik motors down.

They grab masks and mini-tanks and dive in like dolphins.

Jordan snaps up the radio.

A beat.

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

McCool surfaces.

The others surface and swim in.

A grim beat -- and then A CRACKLE on the radio.  With a

voice seemingly from the far side of the moon:

Jaws drop.

EXT.  CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY

50 feet down, the helo lies canted on a reef shelf.

INT.  CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY

Wedged into a tortured maze of hydraulics and equipment,

we find the Chief, operating out of an air-pocket near the

windscreen.  The pilot is dead, impaled on his cyclic

stick, head submerged.  The co-pilot is still alive,

barely.  The Chief struggles to keep the man's head up as

he keys a survival radio.

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

INT.  CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY

The Chief sizes up his air pocket.

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

EXT.  CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY

The Chief props up the co-pilot's head.  Gulps air.  Ducks

underwater to grope through wreckage.  Only now do we see

that "questionable leg" he was talking about:  It's

snapped at mid-calf, blood rivering out.

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

EXT.  CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY

Again the Chief goes below water.  He finds a small breach

in the fuselage... sticks the flare launcher through...

and pulls the trigger.

With a MAGNESIUM FLASH, the flare launches...

EXT.  UNDERWATER - DAY

... streaks toward the surface...

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

... and arcs into daylight 50 yards behind the ILB.

An ominous beat.

They scramble to check their main dive tanks.  Even

through the gauges show full, they're dead empty.  All of

them.

INT.  CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY

He laughs.  It's the bleakest laugh imaginable.

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

Jordan surveys the equipment they do have aboard -- the

stuff she can count on.  Mental turbos kicking in:

INT.  CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY

Swimming in his own blood, the Chief starts to fade away,

losing consciousness.  But then, through the cockpit

windscreen...

A hazy orb of light above him.  The orb grows and grows

until it resolves into a flare carried by his would-be

savior.  Jordan.

EXT.  CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY

Reaching the downed Helo, McCool and Cortez wedge their

oars under the fuselage and leverage hard until...

An opening appears.

Jordan and Flea swim into the breach...

INT.  CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY

... and surface inside the wreckage.

EXT.  CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY

McCool's air craps out.  He abandons his oar and swims for

the surface.  That leaves only...

Cortez, struggling mightily to keep the escape route open.

He knows his mini-tank is running on empty -- and it

scares the bejeezus out of him.

INT.  CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

Twin transports -- Seafox One and Two -- pound across the

water.  Instructors sweep binoculars, trying to spot...

The ILB.  Newberry POPS A FLARE skyward as Slutnik

DOWNLOADS INFO over the radio.

EXT.  CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY

Cortez's air goes dead.  He gives it three more seconds,

eyes riveted on the underside of the helo, knowing they

have to come out... right... fucking... absolutely...

NOW:  Jordan appears with the Chief.  Flea is at their

heels with the co-pilot.

Cortez drops his oar as if it were radioactive and swims

for the sky.

The HELO BOOMS back down onto the reef.

Jordan yanks the cord on the Chief's vest.  It inflates

instantly.  One arm raised, Jordan streaks for the

surface...

EXT.  OCEAN - DAY

... and "Supermans" into daylight with the Chief.  They

covered 50 feet in four seconds.

Doing a 360, Jordan spots...

Seafox One coming their way.

Jordan waves like a shipwreck victim.

Not slowing, Seafox lowers a recovery rig into place:

They're wasting no time on the pick-up.

Remembering the last time she tried this, Jordan gets a

death-grip on the Chief's vest.

The recovery loop comes at her like a big brass ring.

SEAFOX THUNDERS past.  Jordan plunges her free arm through

the loop...

And suddenly they're gone, whisked away by the boat.

Throwing a rooster tail a mile long, Seafox pivots on the

water and heads back to base.

EXT.  GUARD HOUSE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

Limousine leading, a parade of vehicles reaches the base

entrance.  A man exits the limo to expedite matters with

the BASE GUARD.

EXT.  GRINDER - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

All buffed and polished and wearing their dress whites,

the former trainees erupt with ONE GREAT HOO-YAH.  What

began as a class of 100 now ends with just 40.

Sitting among the families and friends we find Royce,

smiling through his fears.  Not far away sits Blondell.

No one claps louder.

Jordan trades high-fives and fierce hugs with crewmates.

Pyro finally manages to take her aside.

It's a small case.  Jordan opens it to find a medal of

bronze and blue enamel.

Jordan nods, understanding.

EXT.  GRINDER - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

DeHaven.  She's holding a press conference, trying to turn

piss into wine -- and doing a pretty good job:

Jordan approaches.  Spotting her, the PRESS PLEADS for a

photo-op with both women.

Letting silence be the ultimate expression of scorn,

Jordan walks right past DeHaven...

And joins Royce.  Together they turn and leave.

EXT.  BEACH - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

Jordan and Royce walk hand in hand, strolling the same

beach she trained on.

Finally, the right answer.

EXT.  AIR STATION - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY

START TIGHT on Jordan's face.  Even beneath the camouflage

paint, we can see her exhilaration.  PULL BACK to find her

in a line of commandos boarding an IDLING C-130:  She's

embarking on her first mission.  KEEP PULLING BACK until

we've lost her completely -- until she's just one soldier

among many, indistinguishable from the rest.
