INT. MIAMI UNIVERSITY - OXFORD OHIO - AUDITORIUM - DAY

Stephen Meyers, Press Secretary to Governor Morris is

standing at a podium on a stage...there is a single spotlight

on him. The rest of the stage is dark.

Stephen is talking into a mic with no emotion...just matter

of factly.

A pause.

Stephen snaps his fingers in the mic. We hear the distinct

sound of feedback getting louder until it stops.

We hear the director speak over the loud speaker.

We wait as Stephen looks around. He looks at stage hands who

are busy working. No one pays any attention to him as he

stands there. This isn't awkward for Stephen, THIS IS

ROUTINE.

Lights come up on another podium revealing a debate stage.

Stephen continues.

The lights on Stephen's podium go out, he's in the dark. He

keeps going.

To the Director.

His podium light comes back on.

No answer from the Director, Stephen continues.

We see we're in an auditorium of a college.

Stephen meets up with BEN HARPEN his staffer.

They walk off...

MSNBC REPORTER stands in front of a camera waiting to go

live. There is a monitor in front of him.

The camera keeps moving into the monitor where RACHEL MADDOW

does the lead in.

As RACHEL's audio continues we see the following images.

EXT. MIDDLE AMERICA

We cruise along a snow-covered rural landscape - flat, gray,

desolate. In the distance we see a barn with huge red-white-

billboard staked into the ground beside the road: "PULLMAN -

AMERICA'S FUTURE BEGINS ON MARCH 15th".

campaign veteran. He's Stephen's boss, the only guy between

him and Governor Morris.

Arms crossed, they watch their man on stage.

The GOVERNOR looks off stage to PAUL and STEPHEN for

approval.

We hear the announcer thanking everyone for attending the

debate.

TOM DUFFY - campaign manager of the rival Pullman Campaign -

is also watching from the wings. Duffy's smooth, calculated

eyes.

INT. MILLENNIUM HOTEL - STEVEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

We're tight on a TV. It's the taped broadcast of the previous

town hall meeting. As the scene plays we pull back to see

STEPHEN and MOLLY making love. We see pieces of body parts.

Hands...a leg...hair being pulled...it's what we've grown

used to seeing in a seventies love scene, all lit by the

flickering of a television. The only score we hear is the

sound of the TV.

ANOTHER STUDENT steps up to the microphone.

We pull focus now onto STEPHEN and MOLLY.

at this time...then he looks back to Molly.

asleep next to him. Stephen's cell phone rings.

Almost at the same time we hear another man's voice on the

phone.

again when the caller hangs up. Stephen looks at the

phone...he then looks to the bedside table where he sees an

identical phone. His phone. He's picked up Molly's phone by

mistake. He looks at the name of the incoming call...there

is none...he looks at the caller ID number...he looks at the

clock...2:30 AM.

She reaches for the phone, but Steven keeps it away from her.

He pushes the redial button.

single staffer is working on a laptop.

pan up to his face.

Beat.

STEPHEN pulls into the parking lot.

INT. MOLLY'S MOTEL - KENTUCKY - NIGHT

STEPHEN climbs the back stairwell to avoid seeing any of his

former co-workers. He gets to the fifth floor and walks down

the hall towards Molly's room. As he turns the corner he

sees a maid's cart in front of her room. The door is halfway

open.

As he starts walking towards her door, we see the HOTEL

MANAGER come running out of Molly's room, he heads the

opposite way towards the elevators...he's fumbling with his

walkie-talkie.

STEPHEN gets to her room and we see a JANITOR kneeling over

Molly's lifeless body.

Stephen steps into the room. He can barely move. He just

stands there looking at the situation.

The JANITOR is on the phone.

Stephen is looking at Molly...he looks around the room...he

sees her prescription bottle empty on the bed next to

her...he sees her clothes all around the room.

The JANITOR now turns and looks at STEPHEN

STEPHEN nods his head yes.

We hear the sound of a distant ambulance.

JANITOR goes back to the phone.

STEPHEN looks down on the bed and sees Molly's phone. He

As these questions continue, the Governor's cell phone

vibrates. He pulls it from his pocket and reads the name of

the caller. It reads "Molly." He looks up. Panic starts to

set in - the only sounds we hear are his heart beating and

the phone vibrating.

The Governor looks at each of his staff members. Then he

scans around the room looking through the press corps up to

the back doorway where he locks eyes with Stephen.

other. Then Stephen hangs up, and the Governor's phone stops

vibrating.

Stephen turns and leaves.

Pause.

As the Governor weighs his options we-

INT. BARBER SHOP - EARLY MORNING

A wide shot of the darkened gymnasium. Stephen sits on a

stool in front of a camera lit by a single television light.

We're now in tight - One PERSON is putting a mic on Stephen

while the OTHER is applying make-up.

No one speaks.

The sound man then puts and earwig into Stephens ear.

We hear the buzzing in his ear of the broadcast from New

York.

Stephen counts to ten. Everyone stands behind the camera.

The sound man with his headset on whispers..

We sit in silence staring at Stephens face.

Ten seconds - nothing.

Twenty seconds - nothing

This scene starts to resemble our opening - A dark auditorium

- only a few people doing their individual jobs.

Stephen looks at two interns holding clipboards and cell

phones.

The FIRST AD is sitting on the floor talking on his headset.

The CAMERAMAN makes adjustments.

A MAN sweeping the gym floor in the distance.

They all seem to be staring at him. They probably aren't -

but he feels it. The enthusiasm and excitement of Stephen

has given over to emptiness. The price of winning at all

cost.

We stay on Stephen's face.

We now hear the Governor's speech through Stephen's earwig.

Forty seconds - the silence is broken by the SOUND MAN.

Through the earwig we hear an JOHN KING.

And before he can answer we:
