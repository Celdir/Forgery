"Philadelphia", by Ron Nyswaner

September 21, 1992

FADE IN:

VARIOUS SHOTS OF PHILADELPHIA EXTERIORS (EXT./DAY) ...

which may include the Liberty Bell, the Italian Market,

scenes along the Delaware and Schuylkill Rivers,

Independence Square, the Russian Orthodox neighborhood, the

ghettos of North Philly.

MAIN TITLES PLAY OVER THIS SEQUENCE which culminates in a

SHOT OF...

PHILADELPHIA'S GLORIOUSLY ORNATE CITY HALL (EXT./DAY) ...

TITLE: "Philadelphia City Hall."

CITY EMPLOYEES, JUDGES, COPS, LAWYERS, CRIMINALS, TOURISTS

pour into City Hall, into...

TWO STORY HIGH CORRIDORS THAT REEK OF HISTORY (INT-DAY).

Young lawyer JAMEY COLLINS darts through the crowd, carrying

an accordion file under his arm like a football.

Jamey elbows his way through a JAPANESE TOUR GROUP.

Jamey trots up a marble staircase, two steps at a time

JAMEY RUNS LIKE HELL DOWN A THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR, FOOTSTEPS

making a racket...

Jamey rushes toward a door marked "JUDGE TATE."

RAISED VOICES from inside Judge Tate's chambers:

Jamey shoves open the door, REVEALING TWO LAWYERS (BACKS TO

CAMERA) STANDING BEFORE JUDGE EUNICE TATE: ANDREW BECKETT

(in conservative gray) and JOSEPH MILLER (in pinstripes).

Behind his back, Andrew wiggles his fingers. Jamey stuffs

a document into Andrew's hand.

Andrew submits the report to the Judge.

His back turned momentarily to the JUDGE, Andrew mouths to

Jamey: "Not bad." But he whips around, serious again:

Judge Tate looks skeptically at both lawyers.

A MAN ON CRUTCHES HOBBLES INTO A COURTHOUSE ELEVATOR AND IS

joined by Andrew and Joe, crowding inside (INT./DAY) ...

As soon as the doors close, Andrew whips out a micro-

cassette recorder, making notes, and Joe, in the opposite

corner of the elevator,

does exactly the same thing

.

Andrew and Joe stop at the same time, look at each other...

And turn toward the corner, seeking privacy.

There's a PERSISTENT BEEPING, Andrew and Joe

pull out their

portable telephones at the same time

.

They look at each other: which phone is ringing?

Andrew resumes his telephone conversation.

The ELEVATOR OPENS: Andrew breezes past the MAN ON

CRUTCHES, saying to Joe:

Andrew hurries down the corridor. Joe waits a moment... then

pursues the MAN ON CRUTCHES.

ANDREW EKERGES FROM CITY HALL, ONTO DILWORTH PLAZA BUSTLING with

PEDESTRIANS (EXT./DAY) ...

... DARTS into the street, hailing a cab.

THE CAB PULLS UP TO A BROWNSTONE ON A RESIDENTIAL STREET,

Andrew hopping out, stuffing papers into his briefcase

(EXT./DAY) ...

RUSHING to the door marked "Dr. Roberta Gillman, Internal

Medicine."

Coming out is a YOUNG ASIAN MAN with a cotton ball taped to

the inside of his elbow.

CLASSICAL MUSIC (INT./DAY) ... AS CAMERA PANS PATIENTS

(MOSTLY YOUNG MEN) in a cheerful room... some, like a UPS

DELIVERY MAN, are attached to IV's, some sit with arms

extended, waiting to be hooked to an IV by TYRONE, a BLACK

PHYSICIAN'S AID.

CAMERA FINDS ANDREW sitting quietly, with an IV drip running

into his arm. Andrew is wearing a Walkman, the source of

the CLASSICAL MUSIC, and he's reading a legal brief. Most

of the people in the room look SICKER than Andrew.

DIALOGUE CAN BE HEARD under the CLASSICAL MUSIC (although

MUSIC dominates the SOUNDTRACK).

DR. ROBERTA GILLMAN, passes through, speaking to Andrew:

Andrew is distracted by A HISPANIC MAN across the room,

rolling up his sleeve for an IV -- his bare arms, hands,

face and neck are marked with PURPLE BLOTCHES.

Andrew closes his eyes, concentrating for a moment on the

CLASSICAL MUSIC... then goes back to work.

ANDREW HURRIES OUT OF THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE, HAILING A CAB

(EXT./DAY) ...

ANDREW HOPS OUT OF THE CAB, IN FRONT OF AN IMPRESSIVE

skyscraper in downtown Philly, at the end of the work day

(EXT./DAY) ...

Andrew pushes through glass doors into the plush "Wheeler

Building," pressing through the tide of WORKERS headed home.

A BLACK PARALEGAL, ANTHEA BURTON, LEADS A YOUNG, BLACK LAW

CLERK (in suit and tie) to the elevators, at the sedate,

expensively appointed offices of Wyant Wheeler Hellerman

Tetlow and Brown (INT./DAY) ...

Andrew BLASTS out of the elevator, flashing Anthea a four-

star smile. They stride down the corridor together.

They pass a silver-haired partner, KENNETH KILLCOYNE.

Andrew reaches the secretaries' station. A cheerful

secretary, SHELBY, shoves documents at him.

Andrew passes a colleague on her way out, RACHEL SMILOW:

Andrew SAILS toward his office.

ANDREW ENTERS HIS OFFICE, KICKING THE DOOR SHUT (INT./DAY).

... DROPPING the documents on his desk, SCANNING them.

... ADMIRING a child's painting taped to the wall.

... PUNCHING into the speaker phone on his desk.

over his shoulder to make sure the door is

).

THE MOON ABOVE THE WHEELER BUILDING LATE AT NIGHT (EXT.)

TITLE: "

One-thirty a.m.

"

ANDREW AT WORK IN THE FIRM'S LIBRARY (INT./NIGHT) ...

Andrew's fingers FLY across the keys of a notebook computer.

Needing a reference, he shoves his rolling chair away from

the computer... opens a reference book... grabs a carton of

Chinese food... (NOTE: The library may be equipped with a

computer terminal which Andrew uses for reference, rather

than a book.)

Andrew eats sauteed string beans with chopsticks, finding a

relevant citation:

A SHADOW falls across Andrew. He IGNORES IT.

ANGLE: TWO MEN IN SILHOUETTE. WALTER KENTON says:

Andrew's hands DO NOT LEAVE the keyboard.

The SECOND MAN steps forward, a silhouette becoming visible

This is BOB SEIDMAN. He and Kenton wear tuxedos.

ANOTHER SILHOUETTED FIGURE APPEARS. This image has a

horror-film feeling to it.

Andrew WHIPS AROUND to face them.

CHARLES WHEELER, also in tuxedo, remains in shadow.

Andrew throws an arm over Seidman's shoulder.

THE RECEPTION AREA (INT./NIGHT): A DOMINO'S PIZZA DELIVERY

MAN, waiting for clearance from a SECURITY GUARD, on

Andrew's dim and quiet floor, WATCHES AS...

Seidman, Kenton and Andrew follow Charles Wheeler up a wide,

carpeted staircase. Wheeler finishes a story and everyone

LAUGHS...

A BOX OF CIGARS BEING HANDED AROUND (INT./NIGHT) ...

The lawyers have gathered in Wheeler's spacious office, with

its floor-to-ceiling view of the Philadelphia skyline.

Wheeler, Kenton and Seidman proceed with the male ritual of

preparing cigars to be smoked: snipping the ends with a brass

clip, rolling them over their tongues to wet them, sliding the

cigars in and out of their rounded mouths.

Andrew, holding a cigar but NOT preparing to light it, watches

with a not completely concealed twinkle in his eye.

Wheeler leans back in his chair, swirling a brandy snifter.

He exhales cigar smoke with a great deal of pleasure.

you

Andrew knows this is a test. And he loves it.

Andrew is distracted -- BY A LIGHT FALLING ACROSS HIS FACE.

Walter Kenton has shifted a lamp, so that its LIGHT FALLS

ACROSS ANDREW'S FACE, REVEALING:

a faint purple blotch

about the size of a quarter, much like the blotches we saw

on the HISPANIC PATIENT in Andrew's doctor's office.

Andrew lifts his hand, finding that his hair has been pushed

back, revealing the blotch.

He stands, nonchalantly running a hand through his hair to

cover the blotch.

A moment before it sinks in, then: Andrew clenches his fist

in a victory salute.

An ASSOCIATE LAWYER in shirtsleeves taps on the office door.

Andrew offers his hand to Walter Kenton.

Andrew and Wheeler are eye-to-eye, an intimate moment.

Smiling, Andrew exits the office.

CLOSE ON WALTER KENTON, THINKING...

ANDREW STEPPING INTO THE EMPTY CORRIDOR, TAKING A FEW STEPS

away from Wheeler's office (INT./NIGHT), then...

... DOING a JOYFUL END ZONE DANCE, running in place the way

football players do when then score a touch down, saying

"Yes! Yes! Yes!" to himself, soundlessly.

The SOUND OF CLANGING METAL interrupts Andrew: HELENA, a

maintenance worker is emptying a trash can. She's seen his

little dance and starts to laugh.

Smiling, Andrew puts the unlit cigar into his mouth, WINKS

at Helena and says:

ESTABLISHING: ANDREW'S LOFT BUILDING (EXT. DAY)

TITLE: "

Ten days later.

"

CLOSE ON ANDREW'S FACE MARKED WITH FOUR BLOTCHES (WE'RE IN

Andrew's loft -- INT./DAY)

It's a mirror image.

The BLOTCHES vary from the size of a

dime, to the size of a half-dollar.

A YOUNG, BLACK WOMAN'S FINGER applies makeup to Andrew's

face, trying to cover the blotches. This is his friend

CHANDRA.

CAMERA PULLS BACK REVEALING Andrew sitting at a table in his

loft, a towel around his neck, protecting his shirt from makeup.

Chandra applies the makeup gently, supervised by another friend

named ALAN. (Andrew's loft has been turned into a lawyer's

command post: stacks of books, documents, etc.). A third friend,

BRUNO, sits in the corner, flipping through channels on the TV.

Andrew tries applying makeup to his face.

IN THE BACKGROUND: Andrew's fax machine receives a fax in

Andrew's "work area": desk, personal computer, etc.).

Bruno removes the fax from the machine, walking it over to

Andrew, handing Andrew the fax, while munching an apple.

Andrew puts on a pair of big glasses with tortoise shell

frames, meant to help conceal the blotches.

Suddenly, Andrew winces, gripping his gut.

Andrew starts out of the room -- suddenly HAVING TO RUN.

CAMERA HOLDS ON Chandra, Alan and Bruno. SOUND OF BATHROOM DOOR

slamming shut.

Bruno saunters across the room and knocks on the bathroom

door.

TIGHT SHOT ON ANDREW, FACE TWISTED IN PAIN (INT./DAY) ...

Andrew rests his head against the wall, sweat covering his

face. A storm of fire has passed through him, and he's hoping

it's over for now.

MIGUEL ALVAREZ RUNS URGENTLY DOWN SPRUCE STREET, DODGING

traffic as he crosses Eleventh Street, toward Jefferson

Hospital (EXT./DAY). He hustles up the ramp toward the

Emergency Entrance...

MIGUEL SHOVES THROUGH GLASS DOORS, INTO THE BUSTLING

Emergency Room (INT./DAY), FINDING

ANDREW sitting on a gurney, holding a cotton ball against

his arm, where blood has been drawn, wearing a blanket over

his shoulders, fighting chills.

Chandra and Bruno are waiting with Andrew. They exchange

quick hugs with Miguel and Andrew, ad libbing greetings and

goodbyes.

Miguel puts his arms around Andrew.

told

Miguel touches Andrew's face, checking for fever.

Andrew holds an empty specimen cup.

Miguel places a gentle kiss on Andrew's sweaty forehead.

Suddenly, the facade cracks and TEARS STING Andrew's eyes.

Andrew pulls himself together, brushing aside tears, in

control of his emotions once more.

Andrew catches the attention of a harried INTERN, whose

surgeon's greens are covered with blood.

Miguel opens a small notebook, making notes.

The INTERN walks away. Andrew's BEEPER BEEPS.

Andrew HOBBLES toward a pay phone, outside a VISITOR LOUNGE,

where weary relatives are watching TV.

Andrew drops a quarter into the phone.

ANDREW'S POV ON TELEVISION: Joe Miller on the screen, with the

words "Negligence... Malpractice... Auto accidents"... and in

the background, PHOTOS of MAIMED, BURNED, INJURED CLIENTS.

Andrew LAUGHS. Then, his call is answered:

FIRST YEAR ASSOCIATE JAMEY COLLINS, SITTING AT ANDREW'S DESK

(INT/DAY), GRABS THE PHONE when Andrew's intercom BUZZES...

they

Andrew forgets his physical pain, this is more important.

Jamey puts his hands on Andrew's computer keyboard.

Jamey types the file name.

Jamey stares dumbfounded at the computer monitor.

Andrew closes his eyes. He can't believe this.

now!

fucking dead

! You tell them that

Andrew SLAMS the phone into its cradle.

He pauses, takes a deep breath, and says to himself:

Calmer, Andrew returns to the gurney, putting on his shirt.

Miguel approaches with tea purchased at the canteen.

Andrew puts his arms around Miguel.

Andrew rushes toward the exit doors.

ANDREW RUSHES TO THE STREET, HAILING A CAB (EXT./DAY) ...

ANDREW STEPS OUT OF THE TAXI IN FRONT OF THE WHEELER

Building, heading for the entrance (EXT./DAY) ...

But he changes his mind, darting to the corner of the block.

Andrew stops to buy a baseball cap from a VENDOR.

He trots down an alley, past bags of garbage, entering the

building through a garage door.

FROM A HIGH FLOOR, ANDREW CAN BE SEEN CLIMBING THE STEPS OF

an emergency stairwell (INT./DAY) ...

Andrew passes CAMERA, out of breath. He's wearing the ball cap

PULLED TO HIS EYEBROWS to hide blotches on his forehead.

ANDREW OPENS THE FIRE DOOR ON HIS FLOOR AT WYANT WHEELER, removing

the ball cap, baring the purple blotches. (INT./DAY)

He walks quickly down the hall. Passing a COLLEAGUE, Andrew

pretends to scratch his face, attempting to hide the blotches

as nonchalantly as possible.

He dashes past an office, ignoring Anthea.

He ducks into his office.

SECRETARY SHELBY AT ANDREW'S DESK, FRANTICALLY SEARCHING

through papers (INT./DAY) ...

Startled when he sees Shelby, Andrew spins toward the wall.

Your

Andrew keeps his face averted, until she's out of the room. He

goes to his computer, the monitor already glowing.

Rachel comes into his office.

She rushes out.

Andrew begins shoving floppy discs into the slots on his

computer, bringing up each disc's directory.

He throws the disc to the floor. Shoves in another.

Shoves in another, bending it in half.

He pulls open a file drawer, dumping legal briefs onto the

floor, frantically spreading them around with his foot.

Andrew THROWS a document across the room, takes a breath.

He picks up the telephone.

Andrew rubs his eyes, this is a nightmare.

He switches off the overhead light. He slants the window

blinds, filling the room with shadow

Bob Seidman comes into the office, typically cheerful.

Seidman is struck by the mess in the office, and Andrew's

disheveled appearance.

Seidman FLIPS ON the overhead light. Andrew flinches.

Seidman approaches. Andrew gives up trying to hide the

purple blotches, facing his mentor straight on.

Seidman sits in front of Andy's computer.

Seidman goes to work. Andrew leans over his shoulder.

Walter Kenton is standing at Andrew's door. His demeanor is

casual. So casual it seems a little forced.

Andrew has kept his face averted. But now he TURNS DIRECTLY

TOWARD CAMERA, showing his face to Kenton.

HOLD ON THIS CLOSE UP OF ANDREW...

SOUND OF A BABY CRYING CROSSES THE CUT TO:

A NEWBORN BEING LIFTED INTO A DOCTOR'S HANDS (INT./DAY) ...

LISA MILLER has just given birth to a baby girl. She

collapses on her pillow, gasping for breath, moaning in

pain, quietly crying a little.

TITLE: "

One month later.

"

The NURSES and the (FEMALE) DOCTOR move professionally

around the bed, doing their jobs.

At Lisa's side, Joe fumbles with a camera while darting

amazed looks back and forth between Lisa and the baby.

He's frantic.

Lisa pops the film into the camera, hands it back.

With wildly trembling hands, Joe begins SNAPPING PHOTOS.

JOE, WALKING THE HOSPITAL CORRIDOR, STILL WEARING SURGEON'S

greens, SPEAKING INTO HIS PORTABLE PHONE (INT./DAY) ...

Passing a PATIENT IN TRACTION, ROLLING BY ON A GURNEY, Joe

drops a business card into the PATIENT'S broken hand.

Turning a corner, Joe comes face to face with HIS RELATIVES,

who charge at him joyfully:

QUIET... JOE, LISA AND THEIR BABY CUDDLED TOGETHER IN

Lisa's hospital bed, surrounded by debris from a party,

paper plates, empty champagne bottle (INT./NIGHT) ...

The relatives have gone. It's late at night.

Lisa holds the baby. Joe holds them both.

AN INTERSECTION IN THE HEART OF OLD, DOWNTOWN PHILLY: A

movie palace (now a six-plex) across the street from the

Peter Pan Coffee Shop, PHILADELPHIA WORKERS going about the

business of the day (EXT./DAY) ...

TITLE: "

One week later.

"

Above the Peter Pan Coffee Shop is a string of large

windows, each of which is painted with a question:

HEART ATTACK? ACCIDENT? MEDICAL MALPRACTICE? DOG BITE?

In bigger letters, across several windows:

D I A L	1	8 0 0	A - L A W Y E R

We hear JOE MILLER'S VOICE-OVER:

A HALLWAY BULLETIN BOARD ANNOUNCING THE VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS of

"Macready and Shilts Legal Services" (INT./DAY), including

"Auto/DUI/Collisions with Deer... Product liability... Medical

malpractice... Pet bites..."

The bulletin board stands at the entrance to a warehouse of

lawyers' cubicles formed by office dividers and plastic ferns...

PHONES JANGLING... INJURED CLIENTS LIMPING ABOUT...

JOE IS IN HIS OFFICE, A BOX OF CIGARS ON THE DESK WITH PINK

bands announcing "It's a girl!" (INT./DAY). On the walls are

photos of INJURED CLIENTS (the same photos we saw in the

background of Joe's TV commercial)...

A FEMALE CLIENT (MRS. FINLEY) faces Joe, her arm in a sling.

ANDREW IS

SEEN FROM BEHIND

, SITTING ON A SOFA IN THE WAITING

area. Very little hair shows beneath a Phillies ballcap...

A MAN WEARING A NECKBRACE, sitting next to Andrew, RISES,

MOVING to a seat opposite Andrew. From this new position the

MAN WITH THE NECKBRACE STARES at Andrew.

MAN WITH NECKBRACE'S POV:

The PURPLE BLOTCHES on Andrew's face are beginning,to recede,

not as angry looking as before, thanks to chemo therapy.

Andrew is dressed casually, in jeans and a softball jacket

(from the Wyant Wheeler team) with "Andy" embroidered over the

heart.

Joe's assistant, IRIS, approaches.

Andrew rises, following Iris past office dividers, HARRIED

SECRETARIES and overflowing file cabinets.

Joe offers his hand, getting a look at Andrew's face.

Joe WITHDRAWS his hand, before it touches Andrew's.

Andrew hesitates. Joe doesn't sound sure.

Andrew sits, Joe returns to his desk. (Joe finds himself

acutely aware of where Andrew places his hands.)

TIGHT ON ANDREW WAUKING THROUGH THE LOBBY OF THE WHEELER

Building (INT./DAY). He's wearing MAKEUP, which sort of

covers the blotches. (NOTE: PICTURE and ANDREW'S VOICE OVER

do NOT match up. This is no ordinary flashback) ...

ANDREW'S POV: RACHEL OUTSIDE HER OFFICE, SAYS "GOOD LUCK."

CAMERA TRACKS INTO THE CONFERENCE ROOM, GIVING US ANDREW'S

POV as he enters the room where Wheeler, Kenton, Killcoyne,

Bob Seidman are waiting (INT./DAY) ...

Wheeler's secretary, LYDIA, takes notes.

Bob Seidman CANNOT look directly at Andrew.

(NOTE: Joe IS SEEN IN HIS OFFICE, or LEANING AGAINST A

WINDOW IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM whenever he speaks.)

Wheeler seems very grave.

NO ONE else smiles.

Wheeler rises, wearing a friendly smile.

Andrew FREEZES -- the full nature of this situation hitting

home. He looks each of the PARTNERS in the eye...

... at last LOOKING DIRECTLY AT Wheeler's secretary Lydia,

whose pen is poised above her notebook, waiting for someone

to say something.

Wheeler breaks the silence.

Wheeler, Kenton, Killcoyne, Seidman and Lydia file out.

Andrew doesn't move.

A SECURITY GUARD enters the room.

CAMERA PULLS BACK FROM ANDREW, WE'RE IN JOE'S OFFICE (DAY) ...

Andrew removes his ballcap -- his hair is cut short, to

disguise the effects of chemo.

Andrew rises, thoroughly business-like.

Andrew exits.

ANDREW LEAVES JOE'S OFFICE, MOVING DOWN THE CORRIDOR

Andrew nods, passing one of Joe's colleagues, a hustler

named FILKO, who STARES SHAMELESSLY.

Joe approaches Iris's desk.

THE STREET: ANDREW EMERGES FROM THE LAWYER'S BUILDING

people passes by. He watches them go, thinking...

JOE SITS AT A TABLE IN THE PUBLIC LAW LIBRARY, SURROUNDED BY

books and legal pads, hard at work. He's eating a pastrami

sandwich which he hides behind a reference book when a LIBRARIAN

saunters by (INT./DAY) ...

A CHAIR SQUEAKS and Joe LOOKS UP TO SEE:

Andrew taking a seat across the room (

the blotches have been

reduced by chemo, but he's struggling with a cold

). Andrew

removes notepads and pens from his briefcase. He takes out a

package of tissues, blowing his nose.

Joe slides to the far end of his table, stacking seven or

eight HUGE REFERENCE BOOKS in front of him.

JOE'S POV, PEERING THROUGH THE REFERENCE BOOKS:

Andrew opens a book, taking notes. Rubs his eyes. Writes

something. Sneezes.

A LIBRARIAN delivers a book to Andrew.

Andrew takes the book from her -- but she remains.

Andrew BLOWS HIS NOSE. Now other PATRONS are watching.

The LIBRARIAN turns away, shrugging to a PATRON, indicating

she's done all she can do.

As Joe continues to watch: one of Andrew's NEIGHBORS picks

up his books and moves away.

Joe rises, gliding down an aisle of books, keeping one eye

on Andrew, who concentrates on his work.

Joe approaches, nonchalantly, as if he just

happens

sauntering by. Suddenly he "notices" Andrew.

Andrew goes back to his work.

Andrew focuses on his work. Joe steps away.

Joe comes back.

Nearby, a CHINESE PROFESSOR looks up, startled, when she

hears the word "lesion."

Andrew concentrates on his work once more.

The CHINESE PROFESSOR moves away.

Andrew removes a legal pad with "KENTON" written in big

letters across the top, and lots of notes underneath.

Andrew goes back to his work. Joe stands there.

Andrew goes back to work.

Andrew SHOVES the legal book toward Joe.

ON CLOSED CIRCUIT TV:

Charles Wheeler, Walter Kenton, Kenneth Killcoyne, Bob Seidman

and SEVERAL LAWYERS and SPOUSES watch the game from a plush,

private box, complete with TV, bar, snack table. The lawyers wear

Ralph Lauren polos, chinos and ball caps. The place reeks of

cigar smoke. Walter Kenton has a twentyfive year old WIFE.

Charles Wheeler's nine year old GRANDSON sits nearby.

Wheeler turns the GRANDSON'S ballcap around, smiling

lovingly at the boy.

JUST BEYOND WHEELER: The door to the box is opened by a SECURITY

GUARD and a well-dressed, charismatic MAN looks in.

JULIUS ERVING enters, greeted by the LAWYERS.

The door is opened again, by the SECURITY GUARD, REVEALING

Joe Miller (in jeans and basketball jacket) and a MARSHALL.

Wheeler turns. Joe SLAPS a document into Wheeler's hand.

A JUDGE'S CHAMBERS, with couches, soft chairs scattered in a

loose circle, like a casual living room.

Joe and Andrew whisper to each other. The Wyant Wheeler team

Wheeler is looking across the room at...

Andrew, who catches Wheeler's stare.

SILENCE. Everyone watches Andrew for his reaction.

JUDGE LUCAS GARNETT enters his chambers (not wearing a

Andrew walks toward the house, TALKING DIRECTLY TO CAMERA.

The CAMERA POINTS to SEVERAL PAIRS OF CHILD'S HAND PRINTS in the

Andrew goes inside, speaking to the CAMERA:

INSIDE THE HOUSE (INT./DAY):

corsages confer in the kitchen. A SIX YEAR OLD GIRL jumps into

Andrew's arms.

MATT and RANDY, (big, athletic guys with mustaches) are there.

Andrew sits next to Miguel.

Andrew's father STARES at his folded hands.

There's a pause before Bud Beckett speaks.

Andrew's construction worker brother, RANDY, wipes tears

from his eyes. Clearly their father is in alot of pain.

Andrew gazes at his father with incredible love. Miguel puts

an arm around Andrew.

Everyone LAUGHS. Andrew and Randy high five.

Andrew tries to reach the icing with his tongue.

Miguel leads Lisa away. Joe is reluctant to give her up.

Andrew studies Joe, trying to figure out the costume.

Joe opens his briefcase, removing a legal pad with notes.

Andrew clears away party debris from the table, making space

for his legal work. He is attached to an IV line, which is

connected to a drip bag on a rolling stand, that can move

with him. He is no longer in costume.

Joe begins ticking off a list of courtroom reminders:

Joe hesitates. They're having a personal conversation?

Joe goes back to the notes:

Andrew moves to the stereo, pulling the IV line with him.

SUDDENLY, AN ARIA BY MARIA CALLAS FILLS THE ROOM --

startling Joe with its VOLUME.

Andrew sways through the room to the music, pulling the IV

at his side. He seems truly free and relaxed.

ANGLE ON JOE: Shifting, uncomfortable.

Joe sits there, fidgeting. He reaches for his briefcase

organizing his notes.

Andrew collects himself, as Joe rises from his chair.

Andrew follows Joe to the door.

Dr. Gillman stands outside a hospital room, talking in a low

voice to Bud and Sarah Beckett. As Joe passes them,

entering Andrew's room, he hears:

Joe steps into...

ANDREW'S HOSPITAL ROOM (INT./NIGHT) ...

A hand-painted banner is strung over Andrew's bed:

"Victory."

OPERA MUSIC plays on a portable CD player. ANDREW lies in a

hospital bed, with a pressurized oxygen mask on his face.

JILL sits on the edge of Andrew's bed, holding his hand,

smiling, speaking to Andrew in low tones. With his free

hand, Andrew gently strokes Jill's forearm. (Andrew has an

amazing assortment of tubes and IVs running into various

parts of his body.)

Andrew's brothers MATT and RANDY are sipping beers with REV.

JIM, MIGUEL, Miguel's sister MARIA, Bruno and Chandra, while

Matt does a dramatic re-creation of the Marine Juror rendering

the judgment. Matt's audience is loving it.

As Joe comes into the room, Jill rises to take the shopping bags

from him. Joe exchanges nods and greetings with the others.

People KEEP THEIR VOICES LOW, but there's a certain energy, and

happiness evident in the room.

ON ANDREW: Watching his friends and relatives with sparkling

eyes and a weak, but grateful and peaceful smile.

ON JOE: Glancing across the room, catching Andrew's look.

Andrew smiles at Joe and pats his hospital bed, indicating he

wants Joe to sit there.

Joe crosses the room, sits on the edge of the bed.

With some difficulty, Andrew removes his oxygen mask. His

voice is raspy, weak:

Joe smiles.

Andrew begins fitting the mask back in place, but his hands are

weak. Joe helps adjust the straps behind Andrew's ears.

Joe stands.

Andrew nods, weakly. But he's still smiling and his eyes

are dancing.

Joe heads for the door, meeting Miguel there.

Miguel puts his arms around Joe and hugs him. Joe slaps

Miguel's back.

Joe leaves.

Miguel begins circulating among the "guests," saying:

Bud Beckett kisses Andrew on the cheek.

Sarah Beckett is strong, kissing Andrew on the forehead.

Randy Beckett loses control of his emotions as he bends to hug

his brother. He begins to sob.

Andrew puts his weak arms, with the IV lines connected,

around his brother Randy, to comfort him.

Jill hugs Andrew, giving Miguel a kiss as she leaves the room.

Maria waves goodnight from the doorway, closing the door.

Miguel sits on the edge of the bed, kicking off his shoes.

Miguel stretches onto the bed next to Andrew, picks up the

remote control, and TURNS ON THE TV.

Andrew pulls aside the oxygen mask, to say:

just arrived from Spain. They enter the apartment, where...

A wake is in progress. Lots of food. People sharing stories

about Andrew. Some people laughing. one or two softly crying

as they hug each other.

Someone has set up a "memento" table, with pictures of Andrew

at various stages of his life, and things that meant something

to him, like programs from the opera, a ballcap, photos of his

favorite cat, etc.

THEME MUSIC PLAYS, but we hear BITS OF DIALOGUE under the

music ("You're Miguel's parents?" "Do you remember when

Andy..." "I went to college with Andy..." etc.)

Bud Beckett sits alone, very quiet.

Miguel leads his parents over to Bud. Bud looks up, rises,

extending his hand to MIGUEL'S DAD. Miguel's father shakes his

head in sadness, reaches for Bud and pulls him into his arms for

an embrace.

CAMERA MOVES THROUGH THE CROWD, SEEMING TO SEARCH FOR

SOMETHING...

CAMERA ZEROS IN ON THE TV SET, across the room, where BLACK AND

WHITE IMAGES ARE FLICKERING, ignored by everyone...

AS CAMERA GETS CLOSER TO THE TV, it becomes apparent that the

images are BLACK AND WHITE HOME MOVIES, converted to video...

THE HOME MOVIES FEATURE a bright-eyed LITTLE BOY...

Andrew...

Riding a bike with training wheels...

Swinging wildly at a wiffle ball...

AS CAMERA TRACKS INTO THE TV, PARTY SOUNDS AND THEME MUSIC

We hear only the SOUNDTRACK from the HOME MOVIES...
