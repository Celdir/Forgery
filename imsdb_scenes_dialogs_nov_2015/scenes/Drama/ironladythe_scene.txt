MARGARET reaches for a jug, pouring milk into it, sliding

it down on a table.

He scoops up the newspaper and glances towards the door -

MARGARET looks beyond DENIS to a a sense of growing

commotion. A concerned POLICE GUARD coming up the stairs

meeting JUNE [early 60's] MARGARET's carer, along a

distant corridor, steady on the approach.

JUNE smiles with visible relief on seeing MARGARET, now

sitting tapping open her egg.

JUNE's look of quiet concern.

MARGARET eats her egg.

But for JUNE, she is entirely alone.

INT. CORRIDOR CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT. DAY.

WHISPERING-

MARGARET looks out of the kitchen. Her POV down the

corridor of JUNE and the POLICEMAN and a CLEANER.

MARGARET slips away.

INT.HALL. CHESTER SQUARE. DAY.

MARGARET hurries through the hall.

INT. BEDROOM. HOUSE. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT.DAY.

A wide cupboard-

MARGARET's eyes move back along the rail in front of her,

her fingers touch hanger after hanger of brown tweed and

grey twill.

JUNE goes over to the curtains, pulling them back,

letting in the sunlight-

The smell of smoke lingering. Suddenly DENIS' hand

reaches across, wavering between jackets of brown tweed

and grey twill-

He reaches for a suit.

The swipe of a clothes brush, briefly seen, drawn across

one sleeve-

Distant footsteps-

JUNE returns, oblivious-

JUNE spies the newspaper, sees the photos of twisted

carnage on the front page.

JUNE reaches one hand out to scoop it up in passing-

JUNE hesitates, leaves the newspaper resting on the bed

as she heads off with the suit on a hanger.

DENIS smiles as he stands in the bathroom doorway,

soaping his face with shaving cream-

He hums to himself as he resumes shaving until-

MARGARET looks up, DENIS has nicked his chin-

She turns, sees JUNE, through the ajar door, standing in

the corridor, looking back at her

INT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAY.

A comfortable drawing room, filled with the photographs

and memorabilia of a former political life.

MARGARET stands by the window, half a dozen of DENIS'

ties in her hand. Pulling back the net curtain, MARGARET

peers out-

Two POLICEMAN stand down below next to a Police BMW car.

They are lost in conversation, pointing to the door,

clearly concerned.

One POLICE MAN nods to the other, a sense of the changing

of the guard as he drives off in the BMW.

SUDDENLY from behind-

MARGARET eyes DENIS, looking at her with wry smile -

Suddenly looming over her and grinning down as if at the

top of a tunnel SUSIE, MARGARET's personal secretary

carrying a cardboard box.

SUSIE's mobile goes off.    She fumbles in her bag to

switch it off.

MARGARET looks at her still nonplussed.

MARGARET nods-

The murmur of SUSIE's voice, a kind of white noise-

SILENCE-

MARGARET's listens, oddly distracted-

SUSIE looks at her momentarily at a loss then scrabbles

back through the diary-

`SHALL WE DANCE' FROM `THE KING & I" SUDDENLY BREAKING

THROUGH AS IF FROM ANOTHER TIME CARRYING INTO....

INT. SADLER'S WELLS. LONDON. 1950. NIGHT.

An orchestra in full flight-

A programme for THE KING & I on a woman's lap. A man's

hand reaches in and her hands slips into his.

INT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAY.

Whilst SUSIE shuffles through the arrangements at the

desk in the background, MARGARET stands at the window.

MARGARET's gaze, seeing DENIS just visible in the street

below. He looks up, smiles,

MARGARET throws DENIS a half wave. In return, he twirls

his umbrella and does a couple of steps of a Chaplin walk

for her benefit before passing the Postman who is

shuffling through his letters as he approaches the front

step, below.

SUSIE looks on with quiet concern.

INT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAY.

MARGARET' is at her desk signing a stack of her memoirs,

The Downing Street Years.

MARGARET opens one, reaching for a pen. The curve of inky

handwriting as she begins to sign them, Margaret

Thatcher.

Close on the swoop of the pen. Without missing a beat,

she writes the name Margaret Roberts...

The insistent blare of an air raid siren from another

time cuts through -

INT. BACK PARLOUR. SHOP. GRANTHAM. 1943. DUSK.

The rumble of an approaching air raid overhead-

The STEADY SHAKE of the table legs all around pulls out

to reveal-

BEATRICE ROBERTS [early 50's] austere, crouched next to

MARGARET under a wide kitchen table along with ALFRED

ROBERTS [early/mid 50's] a cumbersome man and MURIEL

ROBERTS [21 yrs]. The sound of an air-raid siren.

All look at one another in a panic.

Suddenly MARGARET scrabbles out from under the table, all

look on with horror-

INT. SHOP. GRANTHAM. 1943. DUSK.

MARGARET scooping up the butter cover slamming it quickly

over the thin slice of butter left in the butter dish

before sliding it into the cold cupboard underneath the

counter.

SUDDENLY the shop illuminates- A DISTANT EXPLOSION.

MARGARET momentarily paralyzed before, running back

towards the back parlour to resume her place under the

table.

INT. BACK PARLOUR. SHOP. GRANTHAM. 1943. DUSK.

MARGARET scrabbles underneath.

ALFRED surreptitiously pats her arm.

She shrugs, flushing with pride.

The DRONE of the air raid dissolving away-

INT. SHOP, GRANTHAM. 1945. DAY.

A boy and girl look on as MARGARET measures flour on the

shop scales.

MARGARET glances up at her father serving further down

the counter.

INT. HALL. GRANTHAM. 1943. DAY

ALFRED on a small town hall stage behind a makeshift

podium.

The SOFT press of MEN all around, MARGARET, a lone woman

amongst them, peering over shoulders.

BEATRICE tuts, shoving a tray in her hand.

MARGARET sinks a little, taking the tray, and glances

back at ALFRED just visible on a stage.

NOW AT THE BACK OF THE HALL, holding a tray loaded with

dirty cups, MARGARET watches her father, back turned to

the kitchen filled with WOMEN and YOUNG GIRLS making tea

and washing up cups.

EXT. STREET. GRANTHAM. 1943. DAY.

MARGARET sweeps outside the shop, glancing across the

street at-

THREE PRETTY GIRLS dolled up for the evening and arms

linked, crossing on the other side of the pavement.

MARGARET's eyes catch on the glitter of a broach in

passing. They turn to look at her WHISPERING and

GIGGLING.

The FLUSH of MARGARET'S skin -

The STING OF EMBARRASSMENT.

THE SENSE OF THE PRETTY GIRLS WHISPERING ABOUT HER, EYES

TRAVELLING OVER her disparagingly.

The SWAY of a SKIRT as they walk away.

INT. SHOP. GRANTHAM. 1943. DAY.

Close on a telegram addressed to MARGARET ROBERTS, 1-3

North Parade, Grantham.

MARGARET'S father ALFRED, watching.

ALFRED bear-hugs MARGARET awkwardly.

INT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAY.

MARGARET at her desk, the ghost of a smile.

INT. SHOP. GRANTHAM. 1943. DAY

The CHINK of a teacup-

MARGARET looks down the corridor in expectation at

BEATRICE standing at the sink working the SQUEAK of the

cloth against a stubborn tea stain.

BEATRICE comes down the corridor into the shop, wiping

her hands on a cloth. ALFRED goes to hand BEATRICE the

letter.

BEATRICE turns and walks back to where she came from.

MARGARET looks back at the letter, heart bursting, trying

to contain her joy.

INT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAY.

MARGARET looks down, pen in hand, the words Margaret

Roberts newly signed in the front cover.

She tears the page out.

INT. BEDROOM. HOUSE. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT.DAY.

MARGARET napping in bed.

The still of the bedroom, caught in the half light of a

late afternoon-

A hand slides a teacup onto the bedside table -

The flicker of MARGARET's eyelids-

QUICKFLASH -

BEATRICE tuts, shoving a tray in her hand.

PRESENT -

MARGARET stirs again, blinking awake.

DENIS sits by the window. He is bent over a pair of

spectacles, wrapping wire around one of the arms with a

pair of pliers. Other items of clothing of his are on

Margaret's couch.

The murmur of JUNE on the phone-

A phone rings, O.S.

MARGARET considers DENIS now wearing a pink turban and

confronts the extraordinary head-gear.

DENIS smiles, throwing back his head, the swathe of pink

fabric from his turban hanging down ridiculously-

MARGARET sits drinking her tea, JUNE's hushed tones

almost audible.

MARGARET strains to hear-

She makes a shushing motion.

MARGARET resumes listening. The door ajar, the sounds of

life just audible outside-

DENIS sinks onto the bed, bored.

He tuts and adjusts his legs so that his shoes don't

dirty the bedspread.

MARGARET stands, ear pressed close to the open door-

MARGARET looks back at her cup of tea, spots two pills

resting in the tea cup.

She considers the pills, pops them in her mouth, drinks.

INT/EXT. BEDROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT. DAY.

A shout in the street. A woman's voice.

Margaret looks through the net curtains and sees CAROL

THATCHER[early 50's] just visible stepping out of a taxi,

remonstrating with the driver, clutching her purse and

waving her credit card at him with rising irritation.

INT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAY.

A scotch being poured. The cap not quite going back on

the whisky bottle. A frantic fumble for the remotes for

the tv.

High shot of MARGARET sitting in a chair watching TV. As

if she has been there a while.

CAROL enters with suit carriers in her arms.

MARGARET, nonplussed.

On TV, images of a bombed street,

MARGARET nods, both silently listening to the drone of

the newscaster-

The charred remains of cars, desperate people running, a

rescue operation midway-

MARGARET blinks, inwardly reeling from the images-

Quick Flash: Denis in pyjamas, brushing his teeth in a

hotel bathroom, glances at her through the open door.

EXT. GRAND HOTEL. BRIGHTON. 1984. NIGHT.

Chaos outside the Grand Hotel in the aftermath of the

bomb.

The injured are pulled through the rubble.

The WHIR of SIRENS-

The BLUR of FIRE ENGINE LIGHTS-

The image of a BODY being stretchered out of the rubble

by FIREFIGHTERS.

DENIS and MARGARET sit in their coats covering MARGARET's

evening dress and DENIS pyjamas. Both looking out in

silent shock at the devastated Grand hotel, reflected on

the glass of the car windows.

MARGARET looks on with quiet, sobering despair, still

numb with shock. DENIS looks at her. He grips her hand.

They sit, fingers locked.

INT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAY.

Close on MARGARET's hand and whisky glass. Shaking.

MARGARET sees JUNE and CAROL exchange looks of `oh

dear...'

INT.BEDROOM. HOUSE. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT.DUSK.

MARGARET sits in a dressing gown at a dressing table,

staring at her reflection. CAROL stands behind her,

holding up several dresses.

She watches, irritated, as CAROL reaches to move a pile

of DENIS' clothes-

CAROL settles beside her on a chair.

From behind-

DENIS just visible, perched on the bed, looks up from

doing the crossword in the newspaper-

Silence-

CAROL, inwardly stung quietly busying herself, forcing

all emotion away.

MARGARET hesitates catching DENIS' eye, with quiet

warning.

DENIS withdraws into his crossword.

DENIS writes, pleased.

CAROL looks up, with quiet bemusement-

MARGARET deflects, pointing to a necklace in CAROL's

hands.

CAROL slips them onto MARGARET'S neck and fastens them.

INT. CORRIDOR. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. EVENING.

The murmur of conversation-

CAROL tails MARGARET, steady on the approach towards the

drawing room.

CAROL smiles, clearly reassured-

DISTANT LAUGHTER

CAROL gestures ahead, MARGARET nods, reticent, yet

forcing herself on, she hesitates at the door, her hand

trembling on the handle.

INT. CORRIDOR.DARTFORD. 1949. EVENING.

Close up of a shoe being rubbed on a calf. A young hand

hesitating on a door handle.

INT. SITTING ROOM. HOUSE. DARTFORD. 1949. EVENING.

A 1950's drinks party-

A bank of stuffy GREY SUITED MEN pontificating and their

WIVES lost in a separate polite conversation-

A young MARGARET [24yrs] stylish in a suit, straight from

work, stands clutching her handbag, oddly out of place

amidst the neat 50's chintz. A bank of sporting prints

collage a wall. A bespectacled YOUNG DENIS THATCHER

(30's) glances up from his drink, taking her in.

INT.DINING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT.EVENING.

The MURMUR of dinner party conversation-

MARGARET's POV of her fingers absently grazing a

confusing array of cutlery laid out in place setting in

front of her.

Her confused face.

INT. DINING ROOM. HOUSE. DARTFORD. 1949. EVENING.

DENIS whispers.

A long table packed with silverware. She looks back at

her ornate and rather hideous starter, a tiny wobbling

savoury confection in aspic.

Ears prick up around the table. The Host is lost for

something to say.

The put-down, though not intentional, causes Denis to

smile.

MARGARET catches the smile. She remains unruffled and

goes back to her food, picking up a knife and fork,

working her way in, teasing her hors d'oeuvres.

INT. DINING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE.LONDON.PRESENT.EVENING.

MARGARET sits oddly removed, hand instinctively covering

her wine glass, as a WINE WAITER hovers.

The MURMUR of conversation all around-

INT. DINING ROOM. HOUSE. DARTFORD. 1949. EVENING.

Pudding is on the go and Margaret is warming to her

theme.

The female guests exchange glances. A half-chuckle from

someone.

A general sense of quiet incredulity.

Denis lets out a spontaneous guffaw as the host and

hostess exchange looks. He signals `Get them out of

here'. The men rise.

The ladies scurry to the sitting room. Margaret is the

last to leave.

INT. SITTING ROOM. DARTFORD. 1949. EVENING.

As Margaret closes the door to the dining room -

The men laugh raucously. She turns to the ladies who are

regrouping at the fireplace and regarding her with

suspicion.

INT.DINING ROOM.   CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT.

EVENING.

The aftermath of the muted dinner party-

MARGARET at the helm, a small whisky just visible nestled

next to her wine glass. She is flushed and nicely mellow

surrounded by mainly MALE GUESTS-

MARGARET looks at him, her flicker of bemusement.

...slowly registering across the faces of her FRIENDS and

COLLEAGUES including CAROL.

MARGARET still lost

MARGARET deflects, reaching for her glass, it trembles

unsteady in her grasp.

Appreciative murmur of agreements amongst the listening

party-

Laughter-

INT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT.

NIGHT.

MARGARET says final farewells to a guest. He walks away

as another couple approach.

Sitting down on a nearby chair, MARGARET looks with

feigned recollection at the FEMALE GUEST as she sinks

down on the ground in front of her, gripping MARGARET's

hand.

MARGARET hesitates, smiles, nods to herself, considering-

The FEMALE GUEST nods and scrambled to her feet, clearly

concerned, shooting a look to her HUSBAND standing beside

her, waiting to depart.

MARGARET sits alone. In the background, the chatter of

Carol saying final farewells.

INT. DRESSING ROOM. HOUSE. CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT.NIGHT.

A mirror lined dressing room-

CAROL helps MARGARET with her shoes.

MARGARET struggles with the catch on her pearls

CAROL hurries to help her, MARGARET quietly concedes.

Fingers fumble to unclasp the pearls-

CAROL drops the pearls into a jewelry box, close to

MARGARET, staring back at their reflections.

CAROL catches the stray eyelash on the tip of her finger,

holding it close to MARGARET, with a smile-

MARGARET, closes her eyes until-

MARGARET blows. She opens them smiles. CAROL smiles.

MARGARET glances away, deflecting.

MARGARET ignores her-

SILENCE-

CAROL, hesitates, with concern-

MARGARET nods, heading through into the bathroom.

INT. BEDROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT. NIGHT.

MARGARET, sitting on her bed, glances expectantly towards

the door. Carol sits down beside her.

MARGARET hesitates, CAROL using all her might, not to

crumble under MARGARET's cool gaze-

MARGARET inwardly flinches.

Silence-

The slam of a door. MARGARET sits, alone.

INT. SADLERS WELLS.   LONDON. 1950. NIGHT.

MARGARET'S POV of Denis turning to her in the theatre. He

smiles.

MARGARET's FINGERS absently grazing over the programme,

in time with the music-

SUDDENLY a closed fist reaches out, then opens to reveal

a sugar mouse. Margaret's fingers reach for it, but it's

teasingly withdrawn. Finally, she takes its.

She turns to smile at DENIS, her face is glowing with

happiness-

INT. TOWN HALL 1950. NIGHT.

MARGARET sits on the edge of a trestle table, scrunching

a rosette in her hand. The Town Hall is empty save for a

couple of Volunteers stacking chairs and sweeping the

floor. The litter of election night is everywhere.

DENIS appears in the doorway, carrying fish and chips. He

slides them down in front of her.

MARGARET almost smiles. Then sinks once more into misery.

DENIS fishes in his pocket pulling out a hip flask. An

impromptu supper made. MARGARET takes in the aftermath of

rosettes, the whiff of defeat all around.

MARGARET eyes him, mid chip-

She is fuming but he regroups with a big breath.

He grabs her hand, silencing her.

For the first time, we see MARGARET taken by surprise.

She is genuinely stunned.

She is frozen. Then she begins to smile and nod her head

and smile.

He leans over and kisses her, long and passionately until-

He leans forward to kiss her again but she pulls away a

little.

He sits up and stares as if seeing her for the first

time.

She kisses him.

A CHINK of a TEACUP-

They pull apart. FLUSHED and GIGGLING on seeing-

A LONE WOMAN enters the hall, cleaning up the last of the

tea cups, and generally tidying.

MARGARET smiles her joy at him as `SHALL WE DANCE'

swells.

And now she's in his arms as they dance, swirling through

the election debris, eyes only for each other.

INT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT.

NIGHT.

MARGARET now on all fours, struggling with her glasses. A

pile of DVD's on the floor, The KING and I amongst them

momentarily catching her eye until-

A DVD with hand-written scrawl that we can't quite read.

MARGARET flicks open the box, struggling to get the DVD

out.

Fiddling with the DVD player, MARGARET puts in the disc

and considers, squinting at the remote, trying to make

the DVD player work until, suddenly...

Super 8 footage - 1959

Children on a beach in wind-swept, grainy super 8. Denis

with a golf club and ping pong balls practicing his drive

from a tee, sending ball after ball skying into the sea.

Mark and Carol charge into the water to retrieve them.

DENIS approaches the camera laughing and appears to take

hold of it. MARGARET is seen sitting on a wobbly camping

stool, hardly dressed for the beach, surrounded by papers

weighed held down by pebbles. She merrily returns to her

work.

DENIS sits behind her on the sofa in a dressing gown,

watching the footage. She sips her whisky.

MARGARET ignores him.

DENIS looks at MARGARET, unwavering. She resumes a search-

MARGARET SUDDENLY presses rewind on the remote, clutched

in her hand.

The rapid rewind of Denis swinging his golf club.

She freezes the image of him turning to camera, laughing.

Margaret turns with something to say, but Denis doesn't

seem to be there anymore.

INT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT.NIGHT.

Now on the screen, Mark on a swing. MARGARET'S face

softens.

He turns and rushes towards the camera, whooshing past

it.

Without breaking step, suddenly, he's in the room,

running past Margaret, still cheering and whooping.

MARGARET's hand, just skimming MARK's golden curls. As he

moves on, MARGARET's curiosity caught following him out

and down the corridor of Chester Square, seeing the Mark

and Carol disappear round a corner.

INT. HALLWAY. HOUSE. FARNBOROUGH. KENT. 1959. DAWN.

The view beyond-

The CRUNCH of gravel as CAROL and MARK race across the

drive towards a blue ford car, covered with Tory blue

streamers and a VOTE FOR THATCHER poster scrawled with

the words Victory.

INT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT.

NIGHT.

MARGARET now on all fours, struggling with her glasses. A

pile of DVD's on the floor, The KING and I amongst them

momentarily catching her eye until-

A DVD with hand-written scrawl that we can't quite read.

MARGARET flicks open the box, struggling to get the DVD

out.

Fiddling with the DVD player, MARGARET puts in the disc

and considers, squinting at the remote, trying to make

the DVD player work until, suddenly...

Super 8 footage - 1959

Children on a beach in wind-swept, grainy super 8. Denis

with a golf club and ping pong balls practicing his drive

from a tee, sending ball after ball skying into the sea.

Mark and Carol charge into the water to retrieve them.

DENIS approaches the camera laughing and appears to take

hold of it. MARGARET is seen sitting on a wobbly camping

stool, hardly dressed for the beach, surrounded by papers

weighed held down by pebbles. She merrily returns to her

work.

DENIS sits behind her on the sofa in a dressing gown,

watching the footage. She sips her whisky.

MARGARET ignores him.

DENIS looks at MARGARET, unwavering. She resumes a search-

MARGARET fingers brush dark panelled walls, making her

way along endless corridors.

Gothic arches, venerable busts, wood panelling and stone.

MARGARET's pov as she stays to the side of the impressive

corridor. She passes men in suits and groups. Others come

towards her and notice her.

Her POV as she pushes open a first door `TEA ROOM' - a

circle of men turn round in chorus as if something with

three heads has appeared.

POV of a second opening door marked MEMBERS. A row of

urinals. Two headless bodies come towards the camera,

scrambling to zip up their flies.

POV of the promise of sanctuary. LADY MEMBERS. The door

opens onto a cupboard sized space. An ironing board.

A sea of men's Oxford shoes from ground level. A pair of

woman's shoes appear amongst them. They go on tip toe.

From above we see Margaret's hat amongst the sea of mens

heads and shoulders. Margaret is carried along in the sea

of MALE MP's OXFORD SHOES.

AIREY NEAVE [Extremely dapper, friendly 43] approaches

MARGARET.

The doors swing open-

INT. HOUSE OF COMMONS CHAMBER. 1974. DAY

MARGARET, now SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION, on the

front bench, wearing a neat blue suit and a hat, a

phalanx of MINISTERS sitting beside and around her, BLUE

and GREY SUITED MEN, almost at first glance

indistinguishable, with PRIME MINISTER EDWARD HEATH (late

50's), neat, effete, slumped rather forlornly on the

bench.

MARGARET, her speech and papers in her hand is fighting

hard but the OPPOSITION LABOUR BENCHES scent blood - and

they literally bray, getting to their feet and shaking

their order papers in her face.

The SPEAKER tries to control the chamber but his VOICE is

almost lost in the bedlam.

Cries of `Shame!' From the opposition. The chamber

reduced to a bear-pit. HEATH glum and offering no help to

MARGARET whose voice becomes increasingly shrill.

The OPPOSITION BENCHES love that, rocking in their seats,

laughing... falsely of course.

But MARGARET is aware that there are many MEN behind her,

on the government benches, who are also sniggering in

agreement.

Her opposite number Shadow Minister looks almost smug:

smiling, pointing a finger at her.

It brings the OPPOSITION benches to their feet, shouting,

applauding, stamping...

EXT. WESTMINSTER STREET. 1974. DAY

MARGARET walking with AIREY NEAVE towards Downing Street

for a Cabinet Meeting.

All around, heaped high on either side as far as the eye

can see are bags of rubbish. But not neatly stacked, just

thrown there, many of them rotting down, spilling their

filthy, putrid contents onto the street.

The stench is awful - and MARGARET'S expression reflects

that as she picks her way through.

INT. CABINET ROOM. DOWNING STREET. 1974. NIGHT.

The ranks of BESPECTACLED GREY-SUITED MINISTERS   at the

Cabinet table, including GEOFFREY HOWE.

EDWARD HEATH is in mid-flow.

The MINISTERS nod. MARGARET determinedly edges a little

forward so that she is in equal line with the other MALE

MINISTERS.

MARGARET leans forward for a better view, trying to catch

his eye. HEATH wavers, mid-speech. All turn to look at

MARGARET - who sits unwavering. HEATH resumes.

All eyes TURN on her again, hearing the reservation in

her voice.

SUDDENLY ALL THE LIGHTS GO OUT.

A lot of `bloody hell' `oh for god's sake'.

A beam of light cuts through, just for an instant picking

out HEATH'S moon-like face surrounded by darkness.

MARGARET holds the small torch.

A snigger, then the lights flicker back on.

MARGARET turns of the torch and clicks her handbag shut

in satisfaction. Heath's words echo in her head,

`compromise...compromise...compromise...' An inward look

as she's caught by a memory.

INT. TOWN HALL. 1949. NIGHT.

The packed town hall, ALFRED ROBERTS in full flow on

stage.

The crowd of men applaud. The lone woman in their midst,

YOUNG MARGARET watches her father, face aglow.

INT. CAR. STREET. CENTRAL LONDON. 1974. DAWN

...CAROL and MARGARET seated, driving steadily along a

deserted street. MARGARET thoughtful as the radio plays.

CAROL'S nervous prattle begins to break through.

MARGARET eyes the road, gesturing CAROL to move forward.

A yelp from CAROL as the car swerves a little, narrowly

missing a lone CYCLIST-

MARGARET throws a wave from the wound down window. The

CYCLIST swerves on recognizing her, watching as the car

goes round and round the square, almost balletic.

CAROL's squeals of delight, let loose on the open road.

The tyres screech on the corner.

INT. KITCHEN. FLOOD STREET. LONDON. 1974. DAWN.

Laughter -

VOICES on the approach-

CAROL and MARGARET entering kitchen, still giddy from

their adventure.

DENIS in his dressing gown burning toast and attempting

to make breakfast -

DENIS scrapes down the toast, eggs boiling in the pan.

MARGARET smiles, a growing resolution gripping her.

CAROL'S utter disappointment on seeing she has lost

MARGARET already.

CAROL storms out of the kitchen.

A BEAT.

MARGARET sees the burnt toast and energetically starts

clearing up and putting more bread under the grill.

He tries, with a trembling hand, to scoop boiled eggs

from the pan.

She reaches out.

DENIS pulls his arm away, sending boiled eggs flying.

SILENCE.

A beat. He looks utterly fragile.

It's almost challenging. He doesn't answer and she

doesn't notice.

She smiles.

The SLAM of the door, DENIS gone-

INT. SITTING ROOM. CHESTER SQ. PRESENT. NIGHT

MARGARET and DENIS sit on the sofa.

INT. KITCHEN. FLOOD STREET. LONDON. 1974. DAWN

MARGARET eats breakfast alone, engrossed in the

newspaper.

INT. SITTING ROOM. CHESTER SQ. PRESENT. NIGHT

MARGARET grips her whiskey, shaking her head.

Cutting in -

MARGARET'S attention is caught by an old interview,

playing on the TV. She leans forward. On screen, she sits

in a neat hat, leaning forward eagerly.

INT. STUDIO. LONDON. 1975. NIGHT

MARGARET perched on a chair, smiling at the TV

INTERVIEWER -

INT. REECE'S OFFICE. LONDON. 1975. DAY

MARGARET is watching the same interview on a TV monitor.

She is watching herself intently, as are REECE and AIREY

NEAVE. They are polar opposites, REECE flamboyant to

NEAVE's bluff.

She sounds very plummy, like a Conservative party wife

from the shires. And she wears a hat.

MARGARET is trapped in the moment - but the two men

exchange a glance. NEAVE freezes the picture. MARGARET

smiles uneasily, like someone expecting a compliment.

REECE considers her, long and hard. It is a little

unsettling until-

MARGARET stares at him.

Both REECE and NEAVE are aware that she has spoken very

nakedly - and is thus extremely vulnerable.

NEAVE moves in intently-

MARGARET, though flattered, looks sceptical.

A BEAT

MARGARET smiles at them.

INT. REHEARSAL ROOM. NATIONAL THEATRE. LONDON. 1975. DAY

MARGARET stands humming, a THEATRICAL COACH presses her

hand to MARGARET'S stomach.

MARGARET hums lower, tries to project her voice.

REECE and NEAVE are watching and monitoring the

performance. DENIS, though present, is having a crafty

fag by the window.

MARGARET looks over at him.

He doesn't react.

She puts on her new, lower voice.

And DENIS reacts immediately, like a guilty thing

surprised, stabbing out his cigarette, turning quickly

towards her.

EXT. YARD. ICE CREAM FACTORY. DAY.

MARGARET makes her way through a crowd of applauding

workers in crisp white uniforms. Like them, she wears a

white cap on her head.

General merriment as MARGARET, now inside an ice-cream

van, has a go at dispensing an ice cream from the

machine.

INT. HAIR SALON. LONDON. 1975. DAY

MARGARET is having new hair colour and the colourist is

75 percent through putting her hair in foil.

REECE and NEAVE are sitting nearby, both of them reading

the Financial Times.

EXT. YARD. ICE CREAM FACTORY. DAY.

MARGARET among the ladies again.

Laughter.

INT. HAIR SALON. LONDON. 1975. DAY

MARGARET sitting under the dryer, cooking her new hair,

still correcting paperwork while REECE and NEAVE look on,

twiddling their thumbs.

EXT. FACTORY. LONDON. 1975. DAY

MARGARET is standing on an impromptu stage outside a

factory. She has a hard hat on her head.

INT. HAIR SALON. 1975. DAY

The bouffant is now apparent. REECE AND NEAVE watch in

awe.

INT. BACKSTAGE. CONFERENCE HALL. BRIGHTON. 1979. DAY

A darkened backstage. MARGARET, clutching her speech,

goes over her lines. A FEMALE AIDE sprays her hair.

She looks up, starts to move towards the light.

AIREY NEAVE is suddenly next to her.

He looks her up and down, with a smile.

As from the stage -

MARGARET pushes back her shoulders and walks into battle

to the sound of GROWING APPLAUSE.

INT. MAIN HALL. CONFERENCE HALL. BRIGHTON. 1979. DAY

BRITAIN NEEDS THE CONSERVATIVES bannered overhead and

hung with Union Jacks. MARGARET a swathe of blue, as she

passes through her GREY SUITED CABINET.

From behind she stands, arms outstretched, accepting the

applause, a shock of bright blonde hair as she stands

before a sea of CONSERVATIVE DELEGATES holding up letter

cards WE LOVE YOU MAGGIE!

Wedges of fanatical party faithful on their feet in a

kind of rapture. The blessed Margaret !

DENIS just visible with REECE, HOWE, PYM, HESELTINE and

several other GREY SUITED MINISTERS of her cabinet,

seated close behind now jumping to their feet, with

obvious relief and delight -

RAPTUROUS APPLAUSE, FLASH BULBS POPPING

MARGARET smiles, glorious, catching DENIS' eye. He is

brimming with pride. AIREY NEAVE beams at his protegee.

INT. CORRIDOR. HOUSE. CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT. DAY.

Close on a photograph of MARGARET and AIREY NEAVE.

MARGARET sits looking at it, her coat on, her handbag on

her lap.

INT. UNDERGROUND CAR PARK. HOUSE OF COMMONS. 1979. EVE.

MARGARET is loading papers and files into the boot of her

car. AIREY NEAVE drives towards her, winding down his

window.

He laughs and drives towards the exit of the car park.

As MARGARET closes the boot and opens the door to get in

the car suddenly there's a MASSIVE EXPLOSION, the sound

magnified by being in the cavernous underground.

For a few seconds we don't know what's happened.

Through the smoke we see MARGARET running up the ramp

towards us.

Her POV of the fireball of Neave's car. As Margaret looks

in horror at the scene. Her shattered face.

INT. CONFERENCE HALL. NIGHT.

MARGARET on the conference podium, blinking back tears.

Behind her, Denis' face etched with the same sorrow.

INT. STEPS. HOUSE OF COMMONS. DAY

MARGARET walks alone down the grand stairway, sombre,

deep in thought.

INT. CORRIDOR. CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT. DAY.

MARGARET looks up from the photograph, tears in her eyes.

On MARGARET as memories flood in. A TV headline

announces: ELECTION 1979.

INT. CONFERENCE HALL. NIGHT

MARGARET on the podium.

The black streak of MARGARET'S car, a blur of colour,

faces, waving flags -

TV footage of polling night. Swingometers, pollsters,

impressionistic snatches of reported speech.

More footage of PEOPLE coming out of polling stations.

Jubilant crowds applauding..

MARGARET, silhouetted in her iconic stance, arms aloft...

INT. CAR. DOWNING STREET. LONDON. 1979. DAY.

MARGARET peering out of the window, hands sunk in the

lap, a flash of the Royal blue fabric of her skirt,

clenched in fingers.

NOISE. FLAGS. BANNERS read `We LOVE YOU MAGGIE' blur

through the window, an abstract cacophony of noise and

colour-

He clasps her hand for a moment as MARGARET smiles at

him.

The door swings open-

EXT. DOWNING STREET. LONDON. 1979. DAY.

The CAMERA from behind on MARGARET rising up out of the

car, to face a waiting PRESS CORP. The jostle of a POLICE

OFFICER, DENIS and OTHERS press her either side-

The CAMERA rises up, high above MARGARET until she is

just a blue dot, on the dark tarmac, a lone woman

standing facing the circle of cameras and microphones.

The door of Number 10 looms ahead.

INT. DRAWING ROOM. DOWNING STREET. LONDON. 1979. DAY.

The cheers go over ..

The CABINET gathering for a group shot-

Laughter. Michael Heseltine, standing behind MARGARET,

reaches out to smooth a stray lock of her hair.

MARGARET seated at the heart of her entire CABINET, as if

she is royalty.

The FLASH of the CAMERA - the image frozen.

INT. CORRIDOR. HOUSE. CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT. DAY.

The same image, framed on a side table beside MARGARET.

The distant hum of a hoover.

Denis appears, his hand inside his shoe, polishing it

vigorously.

MARGARET hesitates. She sits in silence until-

INT. CONSULTING ROOM. HARLEY STREET. LONDON. PRESENT.DAY

A distinguished consulting room-

MARGARET sits silent, as an EMINENT DOCTOR checks her

blood pressure. The beep of the machine, steady and

monotonous until-

The DOCTOR scribbles some notes, considering-

MARGARET hesitates. She shakes her head.

She looks at him as if he really should know this about

her. The DOCTOR notes this down.

The DOCTOR looks up from his note taking, hearing the

quiet challenge in MARGARET's voice.

The DOCTOR hesitates, letting MARGARET settle until-

MARGARET looks at the DOCTOR, quietly struggling with a

fury, threatening to unleash-

The sudden and persistent buzz of an intercom-

MARGARET holds his gaze, with quiet unwavering steel

unsettling the DOCTOR a little.

The DOCTOR reluctantly answers his intercom-

INT. CORRIDOR CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT. DUSK.

JUNE heads up the stairs, MARGARET following behind.

MARGARET nods. Looking through the bannisters, her eyes

fall on-

A golf ball running along the floor. MARGARET considers,

looks up-

The ball bounces down the wooden stairs.

INT. KITCHEN. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DUSK.

MARGARET opens the fridge. A cold plated lunch resting on

a shelf.

MARGARET ignores DENIS taking out the plate unwrapping

the cellophane off it and placing it on a table, already

laid ready for her to eat.

DENIS picks up a piece of cucumber from her plate. She

absently smacks at his hand.

DENIS smiles.

MARGARET looks at him, silently infuriated.

INT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT. DUSK.

MARGARET pours herself a whiskey. DENIS looms close,

serves a splash of soda.

MARGARET turns, ignoring him.

INT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT. DUSK.

MARGARET sits reading DENIS' spy novel.

MARGARET slams the book closed.

MARGARET's eyes dart to the clock.

Shaking her head, MARGARET tries to block him out.

MARGARET turns to DENIS, a quiet appalling victory.

As he continues, MARGARET reaches for the remote, turns

the television on. She moves onto the radio. Then the

stereo. She moves on, talking to herself-

A gradual growing cacophony of sound-

INT. KITCHEN. CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT. DUSK.

MARGARET flicks on mixers, radios, toasters-

INT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT. DUSK.

The noise almost unbearable now-

MARGARET turns on a hi-fi, the TV now on-

MARGARET closes her eyes.

She opens them and suddenly freezes on seeing an image of

herself, bewildered and leaving Harley Street, caught on

the TV-

MARGARET turns up the volume to full, trying to hear over

the cacophony of noise the changing images on the TV

illuminating her pale face.

MARGARET barely sees her, eyes riveted to the TV.

JUNE moves like a dervish through the house, muting the

television and turning off the last of the appliances-

A gradual silence descends until-

MARGARET takes in the image of herself on the mute

screen, standing bewildered on the steps of Harley

Street.

INT. BATHROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT. NIGHT.

The shelf of a bathroom cabinet. Shaving brush. Razor.

Medicaments. MARGARET begins to pull them all off the

shelves.

Then a pair of glasses. More gently, MARGARET'S hand

reaches into the cupboard and takes the glasses in her

hand.

INT. BEDROOM. HOUSE.CHESTER SQUARE.PRESENT.NIGHT.

MARGARET lies in bed, book in her lap, DENIS beside her

reading the paper. She closes the book and pulls off her

reading glasses.

SILENCE-

SILENCE-

SILENCE-

Voices from the past intrude -

MARGARET suddenly reaches out a hand, her hand shaking-

She turns in bed. Sudden panic, DENIS is gone-

A HECKLING CHAMBER RISING THROUGH-

INT. CHAMBERS. HOUSE OF COMMONS. 1980. DAY.

A HECKLING chamber as MARGARET sits, facing LABOUR

OUTRAGE, the labour leader, FOOT, grips his paper, mid

speech-

MARGARET bides her time on the front bench, waiting her

turn, surrounded by her CABINET MINISTERS including HOWE,

PYM and HESELTINE-

MARGARET remains seemingly calm and serene, and yet one

hand quietly grips the bench, her wedding ring tapping

against the wood nervously.

INT. CAR. STREETS. LONDON. 1980. DAY

A rising roar of voices -

MARGARET in her car driving through the blur of furious

PROTESTORS.

INT. DRAWING ROOM. DOWNING STREET. 1980. EVENING.

CLOSE UP on a button -

The STEADY IN and OUT of a needle pulling taut on a

thread. MARGARET stands, swathed in a glittering long

dinner dress, a SEAMSTRESS stitching a stray button on

the front of the bodice on her dress.

Geoffrey Howe stands nearby in a dinner jacket.

A bank of MINISTERS, including HESELTINE, PYM, PRIOR,

HOWE and GILMOUR, gather before her.

The SCRATCH of PRIOR's hand on unkempt hair-

MARGARET stiffens, the needle momentarily hovering mid

stitch as MARGARET shifts a little-

The SEAMSTRESS resumes sewing-

The patronizing tone inflames her.

Another MINISTER - GILMOUR - whispers the words:

"Grocer's Daughter" - as a put down. The men smirk.

MARGARET has caught the moment. A sudden flash of the

pretty girls in the Grantham Street long ago, laughing at

her.

GILMOUR makes a gesture.

MARGARET is furious.

MOMENTARILY SILENT-

MARGARET's eyes travel around the room in waiting-

They make noises - to the effect that nothing could be

further from the truth.

But MARGARET has their measure.

The SNAP OF COTTON -

MARGARET looks at them in a cold fury...

SILENCE-

MARGARET nods to the seamstress, dismissing her-

MARGARET straightens her cuff, testing the button, as the

meeting slowly disbands and the MINISTERS move away.

MARGARET glances up watching the MINISTERS disappearing,

in whispered conversation, like conspirators.

(ARCHIVE FOOTAGE) Rioting in Brixton, burning cars, huge

civil unrest -

Jobs', `No pit closures" -

by her cabinet, hard on her heels. HOWE, HESELTINE, PYM,

PRIOR and OTHERS. MARGARET talking, they hang on her

every word.

INT. CONFERENCE CENTRE BRIGHTON. 1980.

Margaret mid speech.

The party faithful erupt in cheers, seconded by all

Margaret's courtiers on the platform. PYM, PRIOR,

HESELTINE, HOWE and above all DENIS, applauding as if

their lives depended on it.

INT. LADIES. HOUSE OF COMMONS. 1980. DAY.

MARGARET sits clutching the sink, a light sweat breaking

across her forehead. She looks up-

INTERCUT (ARCHIVE FOOTAGE) bombed buildings, horses lying

dead in the street, an IRA banner.

INT. BEDROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. NIGHT.

MARGARET lost in restless sleep-

INTERCUT (ARCHIVE FOOTAGE) IRA graffiti scrawled on a

INT. CONFERENCE CENTRE BRIGHTON. 1980.

Margaret on the podium.

THE BRIGHTON GRAND HOTEL.

INT. SITTING ROOM. SUITE. GRAND HOTEL. 1984. NIGHT.

DENIS in pyjamas, brushes his teeth in the bathroom. He

glances at MARGARET through the open door as she sits,

still in evening dress, working on her speech.

She looks up, distracted.

BOOM!

An almighty explosion rips through the room; wood, glass,

furniture splinters, curtains flay from the walls. The

fall of plaster, devastating, the hotel room obliterated,

reduced to a smoking, dusty rubble.

MARGARET stands ghostlike, covered in debris.

MARGARET searching through the haze of fallen plaster,

covered with dust, slowly clearing to reveal-

DENIS ghostlike, covered in dust, still in his pyjamas,

holding up an obliterated pair of shoes.

Beyond, the wall of the bathroom entirely blown away -

The CAW of gulls-

EXT. GRAND HOTEL. BRIGHTON. 1984. NIGHT.

Chaos outside the Grand Hotel in the aftermath of the

bomb.

The WHIR of SIRENS-

DENIS and MARGARET sit in their car, looking out in

silent shock at the devastated Grand hotel, reflected on

the glass of the car windows.

A TELEPHONE RINGS CUTTING THROUGH FROM ANOTHER TIME...

INT. BEDROOM. HOUSE. CHESTER SQUARE. PRESENT. NIGHT.

MARGARET wakes with a start, confused and fumbles for the

telephone by her bed-

MARGARET squints, fingers fumbling for DENIS' watch.

MARGARET sits up -

MARGARET suddenly relents, a flicker of sudden and urgent

need, caught in her eyes-

Silence-

MARK gone. MARGARET hangs up, stares at-

I Whistle A Happy Tune from the King and I just audible-

INT. DRAWING ROOM.CHESTER SQUARE.PRESENT.NIGHT.

MARGARET stands in the doorway, a jaunty "I Whistle A

Happy Tune" seeping from the television.

DENIS stands dressed in dinner jacket and bow tie as he

reads the back of "The King and I" DVD.

He takes Margaret in his arms. The music changes to

`Shall we Dance' from `The King and I' as DENIS takes a

confused MARGARET in his arms and begins an expansive

waltz round the room. The room turns. YOUNG DENIS dancing

with the YOUNG MARGARET. Now its OLD DENIS dancing with

OLD MARGARET again. DENIS loses his footing, and MARGARET

lurches towards the desk where her eyes fall on figurines

of Falklands soldiers. She stares hard.

INT. STUDY. DOWNING STREET. LONDON. 1982. DAY.

MARGARET sits, composed, staring up at a phalanx of

military men and her ministers.

MARGARET is visibly stunned.

MARGARET turns to a tea trolley close by-

HAGUE looks confused, MARGARET lifting the teapot-

INT. CENTRE OF OPERATIONS. 1982. DAY.

NAVAL MEN murmuring messages quietly to NAVAL ATTACHES.

Male lips to male ears, something MARGARET has seen all

her life. FRANCIS PYM and JOHN NOTT stand near MARGARET.

INTERCUT (STOCK FOOTAGE) the naval fleet sails towards

the Falklands.

A map of South Georgia and the Falkland Islands. Model

boats sit on the water, flags sit on the islands.

Argentinian flags. MARGARET stares at the map. A

whispered message to one of the ATTACHES. He moves a

model boat on the map a few inches, leading a fleet of

smaller model boats.

He points to a model submarine at some distance from the

Argentinian boats.

MARGARET turns to JOHN NOTT and FRANCIS PYM.

She stares at the map once more. One of the men

supervising the map moves the model of the Belgrano a

fraction further North.

She looks to LEACH.

Everyone is staring at MARGARET. Even the ASSISTANTS

bustling in the background have stopped and are

listening. Male faces turned to her. She herself seems

caught in a pincer movement between the politicians and

the servicemen.

INT. DOWNING STREET. 1982. NIGHT

A flash of a torpedo cutting through the water.

A thunderous explosion.

Flashes of television images- striated and blurry- the

He heads down the hall, MARGARET following behind.

INTERCUT (ARCHIVE FOOTAGE) Victory! The Union Jack is

raised over Port Stanley. The task force return to

England to scenes of jubilation. Embraces, balloons,

joyful embraces.

INT. CAR. DOWNING STREET. LONDON. 1982. DUSK.

Cheers, the street lined as the car pulls into Downing

Street-

The blur of noise, cheering, jostling banners THEN the

shroud of black uniforms suddenly encasing the car,

blocking out the light-

The jaunty distant sound of a military band playing-

The car door swings open-

A CACOPHONY of CHEERS, APPLAUSE, just audible far off, as

MARGARET steps out into the street, the CAMERA follows

her out peering up at-

DOWNING STREET STAFF leaning out of No 10 windows, waving

flags and cheering-

MARGARET's gaze lingering on HOWE and PYM amongst them,

smiling with congratulations, clearly now part of the

victory celebrations.

INT. HOUSE OF COMMONS CHAMBER PARLIAMENT. 1982.

Prime Minister's Questions. MARGARET is at the Dispatch

Box fighting it out with MICHAEL FOOT. GEOFFREY HOWE IS

BESIDE HER.

Huge cheers and "hear hears" from the Conservative

benches. MICHAEL FOOT shifts uncomfortably on the benches

opposite. She is unstoppable.

Barnstorming cheers. We see MICHAEL FOOT, utterly

outmaneuvered by her speech. The Labour benches sit

silent.

INT. CABINET ROOM. DOWNING STREET. 1990. DAY

MARGARET, seated at the wide cabinet table surrounded by

a subdued CABINET. Most of the familiar old faces - PYM,

HESELTINE, etc. All now gone.

HOWE the last enduring minister.

She casts a gimlet-eye over the GREY-SUITED MEN around

her.

SILENCE.

She has subdued them utterly. The silence is terrible.

HOWE pushes the papers over to her. She picks up a

pencil, starts to read.

The MINISTERS watch as, quickly, she starts to score

through the words.

MARGARET looks down at the paperwork.

She presses so hard that her pencil breaks, so she shoves

the paper back towards him, stabbing a finger at the

offending word.

MARGARET snaps her fingers at HOWE, gesturing for his

pencil, scratching away, ringing the offending word again

and again. The MINISTERS stare at the scene appalled,

utterly and wretchedly embarrassed.

She waits for them to take their leave, but they sit

there, frozen.

Slowly, the men gather their papers and file out of the

room, leaving MARGARET alone. She sits, gathering

herself, hands shaking.

THE ROAR OF PROTEST SURGES THROUGH -

ANGRY PROTESTORS slapping the glass as they pass, the

sense of the car being attacked. The smear of smashed egg

against the window screen.

MARGARET sinks back into her seat as the car, is jostled

either side by a blur of colour, the bang of fists

against glass, the roar of the crowd -

horribly.

RIOTERS with blood streaming down their faces. Banners -

With a WHOOSH of flames the north side of Piccadilly

Circus goes up in flames. Smoke and blood and fire

everywhere.

INT. OFFICE DOWNING STREET. 1990. DAY

Late afternoon-

MARGARET sits, silently working.

HOWE enters, MARGARET barely looks up from working-

HOWE slides a letter down on her desk-

MARGARET looks down at the thick envelope.

SILENCE

MARGARET resumes working-

HOWE waits and waits and waits-

The SCRATCH of MARGARET's pen, she works on, refusing to

stop for him.

conversation with HOWE, abruptly terminated, as both men

acknowledge her...

INT. STUDY. DOWNING STREET. LONDON. 1990. NIGHT.

MARGARET stands, watching the evening news, HESELTINE

just visible on the TV screen-

MARGARET turns to DENIS, who stands, clearly shocked,

worst fears confirmed.

locked on the TV.

Turning to Denis.

slide into the chair in front of her.

MARGARET stands, watching the evening news.

MARGARET looks at DENIS, with quiet surprise, hears the

desperation in his voice, the crack-

MARGARET looks at DENIS, sees he is near to tears-

DENIS, fingers touch hers, she looks at him, sees the

tender concern in his eyes. MARGARET smiles, determinedly

steely under his gaze.

On her face as CASTA DIVA breaks through.

INT. HOUSE OF COMMONS. DAY

MARGARET sits alone on the front bench.    A stream of

voices from the past -

The voices begin to blend into one another, white noise.

INT. DOWNING STREET STUDY. 1990. EVENING

MARGARET sips a whisky.

INT. CORRIDOR. DOWNING STREET. LONDON. 1990. DAY.

MARGARET descends the stairs like an operatic heroine,

her hand gripping the banister of the staircase. Below

the Downing St staff waiting to say goodbye. Many are in

tears.

She passes the photographs of her predecessors and stops

to receive a gift, opening it-

She moves down the receiving line of staff. The floor is

carpeted with roses. Men's wet eyes. The door ahead. She

is crying.

Finally reaching the door, MARGARET stands bracing

herself. Denis's hand on her shoulder standing behind.

MARGARET nods, bracing herself. A hand on the door

handle. As it swings open-

INT. BEDROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. NIGHT

MARGARET stands staring at herself in the mirror.

DENIS lies on the bed behind her with the newspaper.

DENIS's clothes are all over the room and the main

cupboard is open and empty apart from shoes. There are

several bin liners already filled with clothes.

MARGARET turns away from this thought and opens a last

big chest of drawers.

She sits at the end of her bed and opens a box she has

found in Denis's cupboard. There is a programme from `The

King and I' and a faded blue rosette from some long

forgotten election campaign. A small flyer `Margaret

Roberts. Conservative Candidate for Dartford' and some

childrens cards "to the world's greatest Daddy love Mark

and Carol."

There is no response. MARGARET is momentarily lost in the

room.

Then, seized by some compulsion, she begins to pull out

the rest of his clothes, shoving them into black bags.

As shirts and trousers go in, quick flashes of Denis -

His youthful face, smiling at her at the opera.

Laughing on the beach in Cornwall.

At the door of Number 10, smiling at her.

Sharing her bed.

MARGARET looks up. Denis's suitcase is on the bed. His

coat and hat lying beside it. She folds his dressing gown

- the one from the bathroom hook - tenderly and puts it

on the top of the case.

And there he is by her side.

She walks him to the bedroom door and gives him a gentle

kiss. DENIS starts to walk away.

DENIS straightens his hat.

DENIS heading out.

The endless corridor, MARGARET calling after DENIS-

DENIS turns back for a moment -

MARGARET calling out as DENIS reaches the window at the

very far end of the house and appears to disappear into

the white light-

INT. BEDROOM. HOUSE. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT.DAWN

From above we see MARGARET lying dead asleep on the bed

on a pile of DENIS' clothes. The bed is surrounded by

bulging black bin bags.

CAROL looming over Margaret, looking horrified.

MARGARET looks around her.

MARGARET looks at her warmly.

CAROL reacts, surprised but pleased.

INT. KITCHEN. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAY.

MARGARET sit finishing a cup of tea. Hears Carol's bustle

in the downstairs hallway.

She stands, picking up the cup.

From behind-

MARGARET's turns for a moment-

It is JUNE. MARGARET shakes her head.

The sound of hot water running. CHINK of a teacup-

MARGARET stands, washing up a tea cup.

The SQUEAK of her wet cloth, working on a stubborn tea

stain, puncturing the silence.

The sound of birdsong and children playing drifts from

the street outside.

MARGARET sets the cup aside, turns and walks out of the

room, and out of sight.

THE END
