As he scrambles to gather the fallen pages, Ellis notices a

dried BOOT PRINT next to his foot. He lowers his shoe from

the cabinet leaving a smaller, muddy print of his own.

He leans in to examine the larger print. The impression of a

CROSS has been left in the heel.

Ellis reaches out and traces his finger in the groove of the

cross marking. His eyes narrow as he re-surveys the cabin.

On the table across from the toilet, he notices several empty

cans of Beanie Weenie. In the booth, he sees a grocery bag.

Ellis slowly raises up and goes over to it.

Ellis reaches out for the plastic bag. His fingers pull back

the edges to reveal its contents: one can of unopened Beanie

Weenie and half a loaf of BREAD.

Ellis reaches for the bread and gives it a squeeze. It's

FRESH. Ellis freezes.

Ellis holds the loaf of bread up to Neckbone.

Neckbone sees the grocery bag. His eyes widen. The boys are

stone frozen. They listen for other sounds. Silence.

BEEP! BEEP! BEEP!

Both boys flinch at the sharp sounds. Neckbone's hand flies

to cover the alarm on his wristwatch.

Ellis stops and points ahead of them.

Neckbone takes the lead, walking up to the last boot print.

They appear to vanish.

Neckbone turns and freezes. A MAN has appeared in the

distance behind Ellis. He stands between the boys and their

boat.

Ellis notices the look on Neckbone's face and turns. He

flinches at the sight of the Man.

MUD(38) stands near the boys' boat holding a pink, child's

fishing pole with cartoon characters on it. He stares back

at them and casts his fishing line into the water.

Mud, not taking his eyes off the boys, slowly reels in his

line. His hair is a wild mop that leads to two weeks of

growth on his face.

With a cigarette clinched, he cracks a smile revealing a

MISSING CANINE. He holds a hand in the air as if to wave.

Neckbone slowly raises his hand up to wave back. Mud wears

jeans and cowboy boots. His filthy button-up shirt looks

like it hasn't left his body in years.

He breaks his stare with the boys. Continuing to reel in his

line, he walks over to them.

The boys don't respond. Mud walks past them and casts again.

Mud takes the cigarette from his mouth. A tattoo of a

snake's head covers the top of his right hand. Two large

cotton blossoms spill out of its jaws.

Mud continues walking down the shoreline, reeling in his

bait. The boys follow, tentatively.

They watch as he grabs the bait at the end of his line and

spits on it. Then, tucking the pole under his arm, he ties a

lock of his hair into a knot. He finishes this process with

another cast.

Ellis, confused, won't take his eyes off the man.

Mud seems easy to smile, which softens his otherwise coarse

look. His words spill from the mouth rapidly, without much

thought for punctuation. Neckbone, emboldened by these

facts, steps forward to answer.

Neckbone looks at Ellis, frustrated by his friend.

Mud, pleased by this news, tucks the fishing pole under his

arm and holds out a hand to shake. Ellis stares at the hand,

unsure. He takes it reluctantly.

Neckbone can't believe his friend is offering this up.

Mud smiles.

In one motion, Mud flicks his cigarette away and grabs a pack

out of his shirt pocket.

Mud's smile vanishes. Neckbone begins to walk off but

begrudgingly stops when Ellis starts back in.

Ellis takes a seat next to Neckbone. They listen to the

song, slightly craning their necks to pick up on any other

sounds. There are none.

Neckbone motions to a beat up Dodge Shadow in the yard.

Suddenly, the music from inside stops. Footsteps approaching

and the trailer door flies open, almost hitting the boys.

A GIRL(28) bursts out down the steps, straight to her car.

She wears tight jean-shorts and is buttoning a white shirt.

She stops and turns back to the boys.

The boys can't take their eyes off her cleavage revealed

under her half-buttoned shirt. A necklace with three

misshapen pearls hangs from her neck.

She snaps the boys' attention up to her eyes.

The trailer door opens and GALEN(36) emerges. He's a big,

lumbering guy wearing a full-body wet suit pulled halfway

down. A faded mermaid tattooed in the middle of his chest.

The Girl yanks off the necklace and hurls it at Galen. He

brushes fingers through his thick mustache.

He walks out to her. She heads for the Dodge Shadow.

31 EXT. BASE OF BOAT TREE - DAY 31

Mud takes the backpack and walks over to the ashes of his

campfire. He squats with his back to the boys and unzips the

bag. Hunkered down, Mud's shirttail rides up over the lip of

his jeans revealing a PISTOL at his backside.

Ellis sees this and motions to Neckbone. The boys stand

their ground, cautious.

Keeping the bag in hand, Mud takes a seat on the stump behind

him. He pulls out a selection of canned food; pumpkin pie

filling, evaporated milk, green beans. He grabs the beans.

Mud removes a good-sized folding knife from his pocket and

makes short order of the can lid. He tips the can up letting

the beans fall into his mouth. Juice flows down his cheeks.

The can is quickly emptied, juice running down Mud's chin.

He straightens his back, choking down the final swallow. He

sees the boys staring at him and catches himself.

Mud wipes off his chin, realizing the boys have been studying

him. He closes the knife and tucks it in his pocket.

Mud gets up, heads for a duffel bag tucked under a nearby

tree. The boys pivot, keeping Mud in front of them. Mud

notices.

Pryor collects himself and gets off the ground. Ego bruised,

he walks off mumbling. The Older Kids keep riding him.

May Pearl sizes up Ellis.

Neckbone waves by wagging a finger in the air.

Ellis shrugs, not wanting to deny it.

She smiles.

Something catches Neckbone's attention. He cranes his neck

forward to get a better look.

Ellis breaks away from his conversation with May Pearl.

Neckbone nods to a cheap motel called the EXECUTIVE INN

located on the opposite side of the Piggly Wiggly parking

lot.

JUNIPER(35), a truly beautiful woman squeezed into tight

jeans and a low cut top, makes her way from the motel parking

lot to the Piggly Wiggly.

She passes in front of the cluster of Teenagers. All of the

boys have taken note. Some cat calls from the crowd.

Juniper, without facing the Teenagers, gives them the finger.

Ellis catches himself and turns back to May Pearl.

A GIRLFRIEND(17) of May Pearl's calls out to her.

If you can find my phone number,

you should call it.

Mud takes a seat on the log and transfers the cans into his

own duffel bag. He holds up a can of the Beanie Weenie.

Ellis sits as Mud hands him a can. They eat.

Mud laughs. Finishing the can, he takes a half-smoked

cigarette from his shirt pocket. He pulls a twig from the

fire for a light.

Ellis thinks on this.

Ellis watches Mud toke the cigarette nub. He's really

getting all he can from it.

Mud stands, surprised by the news. He walks to the other

side of the fire so his back is to the boy.

Mud looks at Ellis through the fire. He takes a drag and

smiles at the boy. The hole from his missing tooth shows.

Mud paces, slowly. He's thinking.

Mud walks back to the log and sits.

Mud looks at Ellis, nodding.

46 INT. ELLIS' ROOM - MORNING 46

47 I/E. MARY LEE'S CAR/INTERSTATE - DAY 47

Ellis stares at the farmland passing by outside as Mary Lee

steers the compact Toyota down a four-lane interstate.

Mary Lee is interrupted by a line of traffic backed up in

front of her. She slows to a stop.

There are flashing police lights up ahead. Ellis tries to

see what's going on but can't make anything out past the line

of cars. They inch forward.

As they approach the flashing lights, they see three State

Trooper vehicles parked to funnel traffic down to one lane.

The STATE TROOPERS stop each car, checking the trunks.

A Trooper signals Mary Lee to pull up to a stop. Two other

Troopers approach her vehicle. The first begins looking in

her back windows as the second leans down to speak to her.

She lowers her window.

Mary Lee pulls the lever by her knee, and the second Trooper

walks around the back of the car.

The Trooper produces a flier with a color photo on it.

The Trooper leans over and holds the paper out to Ellis.

Ellis looks at the photo. It's of Mud. He looks exactly the

same as he did last night, down to the shirt. In the photo,

Mud's smiling, revealing his missing tooth.

The Trooper pulls his head from the window.

The Trooper bends back down and looks at Ellis.

Mary Lee pulls forward and speeds back up on the interstate.

Mud stands and walks to the back of the boat. The boys' eyes

follow him cautiously.

Mud lifts a hatch at the back that would typically house the

batteries and engine wiring. There's nothing left but a hole

into the trees. He makes a note.

Mud turns to really face them for the first time.

Ellis and Neckbone stand their ground. They don't say

anything. Mud walks back to the steering column. He drops to

his knees and fiddles with the wires.

Mud sits up. He looks at Ellis, deciding how much to tell.

Mud's done with his story. He goes back to the wiring.

After a moment, he sits up and wipes sweat from his forehead.

Ellis takes time to consider everything. He looks at

Neckbone, who has a disgruntled look on his face.

Ellis nods. Mud looks over at Neckbone, who still has the

disgruntled look on his face.

Mud removes a cigarette butt and sparks it with a lighter.

Neckbone looks to Ellis, judging his bargaining position.

Mud eyes the boy, pulling on the nub of cigarette.

Mud pulls the pistol from the back of his jeans. Neckbone

tenses, but relaxes when Mud splays it out on an open palm.

Neckbone squinches his face in thought, sizing up this trade.

Neckbone steps forward to grab the pistol, but Mud puts it

back in his jeans.

Neckbone looks over at Ellis, who shrugs.

The boys see Mud take a seat on a nearby stump. He's

explaining something. Tom listens, standing over him.

Ellis watches Mud as he gestures and speaks. He seems

different. Younger.

Mud stops talking. Tom scratches a hand through his white

crew cut. He begins pointing a finger at Mud. His face is

flushed and the sound of his voice carries to the boys,

though still unintelligible.

AT THE TREELINE,

Mud's head hangs as Tom shouts at him.

Waits for a response, but Mud gives none.

Mud looks up at him.

AT THE BOAT,

They see Tom turn his back on Mud and head toward the boat.

Mud doesn't protest; he doesn't move.

Tom brushes past Ellis.

Tom shoves the boat back into the water. Neckbone helps him.

Ellis looks back at Mud, who still hasn't moved from his

stump. He goes to him. Tom sees this and stops pushing.

AT THE TREELINE,

Ellis stops a good six feet back from where Mud sits.

Mud raises his head.

He stands and takes a folded piece of paper from his shirt.

Ellis steps forward and Mud hands over the note. Ellis takes

it and walks back to the others.

AT THE BOAT,

Tom stares at Ellis as he climbs on board.

Tom looks back at Mud, who is watching him. He gives the

boat a final shove before pulling himself in. They motor

away. Tom doesn't look back.

Neckbone is yelling at the top of his lungs, almost in a

girl's pitch. Carver turns to him. The cooler is open

behind them and Neckbone holds up two Ziplock bags of fish.

Carver sizes things up. It takes a moment, but he settles.

He snorts out a laugh and drops Ellis on the ground.

Carver turns his attention back to Juniper, who is huddled up

in the corner of the motel. Carver walks over to her.

Opening a good-sized knife, he gets down in her face and

holds the blade uncomfortably close to her cheek.

She flinches. Standing, Carver folds up his knife.

Carver turns, stepping over Ellis on his way out.

Neckbone moves from the doorway to let him pass. Carver is

gone. Neckbone shuts the door and fastens the security

latch. He kneels down to check on his friend.

Ellis holds the back of his hand up to his eye which has

begun to swell. The cut trickles blood over his cheekbone.

Juniper moves to the sink. Ellis sits up, staring at her

back.

She opens an ice bucket and wraps a handful of cubes in a

towel. She turns and walks over to them, her eyes cast down.

She kneels in front of Ellis, making eye contact for the

first time. She touches his chin, gently pivoting it to see

the wound. Her eyes are glassy.

He stares back at her. He can't take his eyes off her. She

holds the iced towel to his cheek. He doesn't even flinch.

Tears form and run down her cheeks.

She takes his hand and places it against the towel. She gets

to her feet and pulls a pocket book from a bag in the corner.

Ellis motions Neckbone to the cooler. Neckbone goes over and

crams his hand into the ice. He removes a Ziplock bag

containing the note that Mud sent.

Neckbone hands it to Ellis. Taking the note, he sets his ice

down and walks over to Juniper.

Juniper is stunned. She looks at the bag, then at the boys.

Ellis nods. Neckbone speaks up from the back.

Juniper takes the bag. She removes the letter and takes a

seat on the edge of the bed to read it.

Ellis watches her eyes move along the paper. She smiles,

which makes Ellis smile. After a moment, she folds it up.

Juniper raises her eyebrows at Neckbone.

Juniper shakes her head and goes to the sink. She pulls a

lighter from her jeans pocket and torches Mud's note.

Running water over the ashes, she turns back to them.

She motions to his swelling eye. Ellis shrugs.

Ellis heads to the door as Neckbone gathers up the cooler.

Ellis turns back.

Mud's face turns dark.

Mud slings the rope to the ground and kicks it. His face is

flushed. It's the first time the boys have seen him angry.

The boys back up. Mud takes a deep breath, tries to cool

down. It takes a moment, then something occurs to him. He

eyes Ellis with a look of genuine gratitude.

Ellis nods. Mud picks up the rope.

alone in a suit. He holds a LONG SUITCASE.

Tom enters holding two cups of coffee.

He hands Ellis a cup of coffee with a cartoon image of a dog

on it. It reads, "I'm a real bitch in the morning!" Tom

sits in a LazyBoy that he gently rocks in.

Ellis nods. There is an awkward moment.

Tom snorts out a laugh, sips his coffee.

Tom notices the boy's disappointment.

Ellis can't look Tom in the eye, he's offended by the old

man's remarks. Ellis sets the coffee cup on the desk.

Ellis heads for the door, but stops short.

King removes a photocopied picture of Mud from his pocket.

He unfolds it, stares at it, then raises it to the men.

King stares at the men, keeping the photo held high.

The front door flies open. Senior storms headlong toward

Ellis. He shouts.

Ellis turns as Senior yanks the phone by the cord. It snaps

out of Ellis' hand and smashes apart on the floor. Ellis

flinches at the sight of his father flying at him.

Senior grabs Ellis by the arms and shoves him against the den

wall. Mary Lee comes running from her room.

She slaps at her husband's arms and back. He swats her away.

Senior keeps Ellis pinned to the wall with his left hand. He

opens up and addresses Mary Lee with his right.

This makes Mary Lee pause.

A cool anger rushes over Senior's face. He releases Ellis

and takes a step back.

Ellis drops his head. His face flushed.

Senior volleys a finger at Ellis.

Mary Lee slaps Senior hard. He turns to her, saying nothing.

She wipes her eyes and turns her attention to Ellis.

Mary Lee walks to the front door. She collects her purse and

keys and exits quietly.

Senior and Ellis stand in silence, which feels even more

uncomfortable than the shouting. Ellis finally speaks.

Senior, stoic, pivots his body away from the boy.

Senior retreats to the bedroom. Ellis is left alone in the

wake.

He looks to his room. The door opens slightly and Neckbone

takes a step out. Neckbone doesn't say anything. He just

It's a look of resignation.

Ellis watches her as she goes to the sink and wets the end of

a towel. She dabs her eyes at the mirror.

Her back to him, Ellis watches as she unfolds the letter and

begins reading. He angles himself to see her face in the

mirror. He watches her eyes scanning the words. No emotion.

Ellis appears with his elbows in the driver's side window.

He sticks his head so far in the door that Kyle has to lean

back in his seat to make room. May Pearl is surprised. Kyle

snorts out a laugh.

Ellis takes his right elbow and quickly knocks Kyle in the

mouth. It splits his upper lip. Kyle grabs his face.

Kyle slings the door open knocking Ellis to the pavement.

From the ground, Ellis can see that Kyle is big and

considerably tougher than the skinny kid he punched before.

Kyle's friends from other cars take notice and begin to

converge on them.

Ellis makes a move for Kyle's legs but is kicked back to the

pavement. Kyle straddles him on the ground and punches him.

Another punch to Ellis' face. May Pearl is out of the car

and yelling.

May Pearl pulls Kyle by the collar. By his own will, he

raises off of Ellis, keeping an eye on him.

A streak of blood stretches from Ellis' nose to his ear. He

gets to his feet, dazed.

Ellis wipes at his nose and sees May Pearl shove Kyle. Kyle

smiles and turns to his friends, who laugh. The CROWD that

has collected consists of older high school guys and girls.

Ellis steps toward May Pearl and is met with a shove too.

The crowd is watching.

The wheels finally turn over. The trailer rolls down the

bank and splashes into the water. The boat shimmies.

Mud and Neckbone follow the trailer into knee deep water and

shove on the boat. A final push jettisons it into the river.

They step back as the boat drifts out. A rope tied to its

back becomes taught as it stretches from a tree on shore.

Mud smiles. He holds out his hand, which Neckbone slaps.

Mud walks back on shore and collects his duffel bag.

Mud removes the pistol from the back of his jeans.

Neckbone's eyes light up. Mud hands it over and Neckbone

immediately notices a hole where the clip is missing.

Neckbone begrudgingly crams the pistol into the back of his

pants.

Neckbone sucks his teeth.
