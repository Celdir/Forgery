EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - MORNING

TWIN BOYS, RUDY AND JACOB CARGES (12), ride their bikes

through a suburban neighborhood.

Rudy, the more athletic of the two, rides at a breakneck

pace. Jacob rides slowly due to a HOCKEY MASK that he wears

over his face. It's making it difficult for him to see. The

boys turn down a DIRT PATH and ride deep into some WOODS.

INT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS

Rudy and Jacob ride to the edge of a CLEARING and stop.

Across from the clearing is a large OAK TREE, which has a

TREE HOUSE perched high up in it's branches. The boys

cautiously look around and whisper.

After a beat, Rudy gets off his bike and starts walking

towards the tree house.   Jacob stays behind, eyeing their

safety.

Suddenly, a ROCK comes careening from off screen.   It hits

Jacob in the head and knocks him to the ground.

Rudy darts for the oak tree as a hail storm of rock and

debris come flying at him.

As Jacob rises, a stream of blood pours down the front of his

mask. He quickly runs for the tree.

TWO BOYS, JEFF AND KENNY (14), trailer park, punks come

running out of the woods, rocks in hand.

Rudy and Jacob climb the tree, using makeshift RUNGS that are

nailed into the trunk. In the floor of the tree house is a

DOOR. Rudy removes a KEY from a chain around his neck and

unlocks it. He climbs inside and pulls Jacob in after him.

crosses to the door with a BUCKET of liquid.

inscribed on the center of it. He eats POPCORN. Hanging off

standing behind them. He has heard every word.

Hurt, Leonard looks down at his own plate, which overflows

with food. He feels embarrassed and disgusted.

Patrick rises and crosses over to the buffet table.

Patrick grabs the ladle and begins to fill up his plate.

He walks off with his food. Leanard looks down at the food,

shrugs, then helps himself to a heaping porion.

EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE STREET - DUSK

olds, having a water balloon fight. Jealous, he

CONTINUED:

Kenny pushes Rudy to the ground and then jumps on top of him.

Rudy struggles to get free, but he's overpowered. A crowd of

kids surround them, chanting, "FIGHT, FIGHT".

Jeff hocks a phlegm wad onto Rudy's face. Rudy screams as

the stream of saliva, drips across his nose and onto his lip.

Kenny looks up and sees a neighborhood parent coming over.

Kenny pushes Rudy down once more and runs off.      Rudy slowly

rises, wiping the saliva from his face.

EXT. VACANT LOT - LATER THAT NIGHT

The entire neighborhood has descended upon a VACANT LOT.

They are awaiting the annual, fireworks display.

We FIND Leonard, Jacob and Malee sitting on a large rock,

which gives them a birds eye view of the crowd.

Rudy runs over to the rock and climbs up top.

CONTINUED:

Leonard looks between Jacob and Malee.

Insulted, Jacob slides off the rock and walks away.       Malee

follows.

We SCAN the room and come to a set of BUNK BEDS.

light. Reveal, it's RUDY. Rudy grabs his watch from the

post and silences the alarm. Jacob sits up in bed.

The treehouse is illuminated by the full moon, which rests in

the sky above. The thunderous sound of a million crickets

fills the air.

Both boys lie asleep. A mosquito flies in through the window

and buzzes past Leonard's ear. He haphazardly swipes at it

in his sleep, wakes himself up.

Rudy jumps awake.

CONTINUED:

Leonard rises, picks up his bag and opens the TRAP DOOR in

the floor. He is about to exit.

Suddenly, a FLAMING COCKTAIL comes flying through the window.

It hits Rudy in the head, explodes and engulfs him in flames.

EXT. TREEHOUSE - SAME TIME

Jeff and Kenny stand a few yards away from the treehouse.

Both laugh at the sight of the flames inside.

Jeff lights his COCKTAIL. It misses the window and smashes

into the side of the tree house.

Jeff and Kenny hear Leonard and Rudy screaming from inside.

INT. TREEHOUSE - SAME TIME

Rudy, now covered in flames, rolls on the floor, screaming.

ON JIM and ASHLEY, watching Rudy's casket as it is lowered

into the ground. The once spirited, couple now looks tired

and pained. They are accompanied by a number of mourners.

Jacob stands beside his parents. Tears stream from his eyes,

across his birthmark and off his chin. So stricken with

grief, Jacob barely has to energy to wipe the tears away.

We continue on through the crowd and find Malee. Embarrassed

by the tears, she brings a black veil down over her face.

Ashley slams her cupboard doors shut. She looks around and

spots the GARBAGE PAIL across the kitchen.

dumps the trash all over the floor. Ashley gets on her knees

and starts searching.

looks her in the eye.

Leonard looks like a stuffed sausage.

With each step he takes, Leonard breathing becomes heavier

and heavier. Sweat forms on his forehead and drips down his

face.

Within seconds, Leonard's pace tapers off. He struggles to

continue but is so out of shape, stopping is inevitable.

as if nothing happened. Jacob is baffled by their behavior.

INT. JUVY HALL - COMMUNICATION BOOTH - LATER THAT NIGHT

Jacob and Kenny are on the phone together. Kenny looks gaunt

and tired. Jeff's death has obviously affected him.

watches through the glass, touched by Kenny's reaction.

MUSIC OVER SHOT:    UPBEAT CHRISTMAS MUSIC

INT. JACOB'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - CHRISTMAS MORNING

Jacob sits on the floor, surrounded by boxes and wrapping

paper. Santa has obviously been good to him.

Jim sits on the couch, drifting in and out of sleep.

Ashley, dressed in her finest Christmas sweater, peruses the

fireplace mantel and all of the decorations that line it.

She is a drastically different woman than the last time we

saw her. She looks upbeat and pretty.

Ashley looks at Jacob and smiles.    He has just unwrapped an

IPOD.

CONTINUED:

Ashley smiles at her son. It's a bittersweet moment for her.

Ashley crosses to the couch and sits beside Jim.    They hold

each others hands.

Off Jacob's shock -

INT. LEONARD'S HOME - DINING ROOM       - DAY

Leonard's extended    family sits at the kitchen table, eating

Christmas dinner.     His extended family is just as overweight

SPARE KEY underneath.

INT. GUS'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Malee cautiously enters, shutting the door behind her. A

beat. She allows the excitement to settle in. It's your

typical bachelor pad. Stray beer bottles decorate every

shelf and end table. Dirty clothes drape across an old

couch. Malee continues on to the kitchen.

INT. GUS' APARTMENT - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Malee finds the kitchen more of a mess than the living room.

Pots, pans and stacks of TV dinners line the counter top.

INT. GUS'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

INT. GUS' APARTMENT - KITCHEN/BEDROOM - SECONDS LATER

Gus removes a beer from the fridge. We follow him into his

bedroom. He stops cold as if feeling the presence of some

floor and SEE Malee, hiding underneath his bed.

SFX: FOOTSTEPS, DOOR OPENING, SHOWER RUNNING

FADE IN:

EXT. STREET - MONTHS LATER - MORNING

ON TWO FEET, running. We REVEAL that it's LEONARD. His once

skinny, Leonard is in perfect shape. He runs fast, carefully

avoiding puddles of melting snow. (Spring is fast on the

horizon.)

INT. JUVY HALL - CONVERSATION BOOTH - NEXT DAY

Yacco notices a number of department store bags strewn

everywhere.

REVEAL MALEE, standing across the room. She is no longer the

gawky, adolescent girl. Rather, she has been transformed

into a beautiful young woman. Her glasses have been replaced

by contacts, and her braided pig tails by a quaff of chin

length curls.

Malee spins around, giving Yacco the full picture.

CONTINUED:

Yacco exits.    Malee looks in the mirror, deflated.

Gus watches a CEMENT TRUCK, dumping cement into a foundation.

Once the cement is poured, the truck pulls forward. Malee is

jaw drops.

Off Malee's smile -

EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - ANOTHER AREA - LATER

Gus and Malee eat their lunch.

Gus is stumped.

EXT. LEONARD'S DRIVEWAY - NEXT DAY

Leonard watches Patrick and his sisters drive off in a

TAXICAB.

from the window. They lock eyes for a moment and then Grace

disappears into the dark recesses of the home.

INT. LEONARD'S HOME - BASEMENT - NIGHT

Leonard descends the staircase and begins looking around at

the setting. Boxes of junk clutter the floor along with old

furniture and bicycles.

He crosses to the basement door, which leads out to the

backyard. As Leonard unlocks and opens the door, a mass of

cobwebs stretch across the frame like elastic bands. Leonard

grabs a nearby broom and starts wiping away the cobwebs.

INT. MALEE'S HOME - BEDROOM - EARLY EVENING

Malee enters her room, locks the door behind her and empties

her bag of SEX books on the bed. The first one she peruses

is the "KARMA SUTRA". At first glance, Malee's eyes go wide

in shock. She grabs her backpack and removes a number of

index cards. Malee starts taking notes.

INT. JUVY HALL - COMMUNICATION BOOTHS - NEXT DAY

Silence.

Grace begins walking downstairs. Due to her size, she has

difficultly maneuvering through the tight space. Her

inability to see her feet isn't helping matters.

Grace makes it downstairs, but Leonard is nowhere in sight.

Suddenly, Leonard bursts through the bathroom door with a

hammer in hand. He runs past Grace and up the stairs.

Half way up the stairs, Leonard stops and pries two of the

steps off the stair case with his hammer. This creates a

GAP, making it virtually impossible for Grace to ascend.

beside the table and dressed only in her robe.

looks away.

CONTINUED:

Malee starts walking towards him.

Gus doesn't answer. Malee is right behind him now.     She puts

her head on his back.

Gus slowly turns around and looks at Malee for a long,

pregnant beat. It's a tense moment, and we are unsure of

what he's going to do. Then Gus moves past her and crosses

to the living room.

Now embarrassed and crushed, she starts to cry.

off his hand and pushes Keith to the ground.

Keith struggles to get free, but Jacob is too strong.

Jacob gets off of Keith and crosses to his closet. He pulls

out the lock box, unlocks it and removes the gun. He points

it at Keith.

Keith nods, petrified. Jacob puts the gun back in the lock

box, throws it in the closet and storms out of the room.

INT. JACOB'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Ashley sits at the kitchen table, looking at a picture of

Rudy and Jacob when they were infants. Her eyes are filled,

untouched. Angry and disgusted, she takes it and throws it

at the wall.

stove. Leonard quickly turns the gas low, extinguishing the

flame. He removes the pot from the burner, grabs a strainer

and removes poached EGG WHITES from the water.

CONTINUED:

Leonard grabs a dish towel and begins wiping the water off

the stove. Preoccupied, he doesn't realize that when he

wipes the oven knob dry, he turns the gas on high. (Since

the overflowing water, extinguished the pilot light, he is

unaware that gas is now being emitted from the burner.)    In

his condition, HE WON'T BE ABLE TO SMELL IT.

Grace coughs hard.

Grace grabs a hold of the railing and starts climbing the

stairs. After a few steps, she stops to rest, wheezing.

With the help of the railing, Grace pulls herself up to the

GAP in the staircase. In one forceful exertion, she propels

her body up and forward. The railing instantly becomes

separated from the wall. Grace lands in a heap.

Luckily, the top half of her body made it to the other side.

With all of her might, Grace pulls herself up to the landing.

INT. LEONARD'S HOME - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Exhausted and wheezing, Grace drags herself over to the stove

window and watches as Jacob runs off.

Immediately, Keith crosses to the closet. He removes the

lock box and begins trying combinations to open it.

A heavy rain begins to fall as Jacob rides up. He sees

Kenny, standing inside of a partially, constructed house.

ground instantly.

The force of the gun, knocks Jacob to the ground.      As he

falls, the hockey mask comes down over his face.

Jacob sits for a beat, staring at Kenny's lifeless body.

Lightning flashes, illuminating his blue eyes through the

hockey mask.

It's a bittersweet moment. While relieved by the fact that

his crime will be hidden, the guilt overwhelms him.

Jacob turns his bike around, and the two ride off together.

Malee eyes Jacob, sensing that something is wrong.

BACK ON the foundation. Gus enters frame and begins

spreading cement over Kenny's grave.
