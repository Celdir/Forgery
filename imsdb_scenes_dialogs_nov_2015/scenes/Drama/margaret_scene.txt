1 EXT. MANHATTAN. BROADWAY. UPPER 70S. DAY. 1

From across Broadway we see a little girl waiting at the

curb. She steps off the curb toward us --

A TRUCK BARRELS into frame -- The long lens' flattened

perspective makes it look like she's just been crushed. But

the truck flashes by and she's fine. More traffic passes to

and fro through the frame.

CREDITS BEGIN OVER:

2 EXT. ANOTHER CORNER. DAY. 2

The LIGHT CHANGES and a crowded corner full of New Yorkers

step off the curb and into the crosswalk -- Before the first

foot lands on the street we go to SUPER SLOW MOTION as the

mid-day work crowd crosses the street.

3 EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREETS. DAY. 3

MONTAGE -- Slow motion shots of New Yorkers, mid-day, all

kinds, going all different ways, all over the city.

CREDITS END with some high school kids with book bags,

walking among the crowds.

4 INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM. DAY. 4

An 11th-grade math class at the Ralph Waldo Emerson School,

one of the few remaining Manhattan '60s-inspired progressive

schools. About twenty kids, mostly white secular Jewish. A

sprinkling of black and Hispanic kids.

The teacher, MR AARON, late 20s, is returning test papers.

Abrams... Allende...

One after the other the students get up to collect their

tests, glance at the results and drag themselves back to

their chairs.

On LISA COHEN, just 17. Not the best-looking girl in her

class but definitely in the top five. She listens listlessly,

somewhat bad-temperedly.

MR AARON (CONT'D)

Bernstein... Cohen...

At "Cohen" LISA gets up and heads for the desk.

LISA'S POV, closing in slowly on MR AARON who glances up at

her as she approaches. Their eyes meet. Aaron has the classic

handsome young teacher's no-nonsense expression on his face

as she reaches out her hand --

Thank you, Mr Aaron.

She walks back. On her test he's written: B- "SEE ME1"

5 INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM. DAY. LATER. 5

AFTER CLASS -- The last students go out as Mr Aaron gestures

for Lisa to take a seat.

Take a seat, Lisa. I just wanna talk about

your test for a minute.

Sure.

Now...I know you had a little help...

Well -- I mean -- I didn't cheat, if that's

what you mean.

I'm just saying I know you had a little

help.

A lot of people did.

Be that as it may --

I mean I'll take it over again if you want,

but like, what would be the point?

It's not like I'm ever gonna actually need

to know this stuff in my daily life...

Well, Lisa, that's just not necessarily

true. Haven't you ever developed an

interest in something you didn't initially

think you were going to develop an interest

in?

Um, no, not really.

Mr Aaron looks down for a moment to hide his amusement. Lisa

looks at him with secret adoration. He looks up.

Anyway, it was open book. So what's the big

difference-between using a book and like, I

don't know, using somebody else's mind

who's like, really good at math? It's not

like this person did the whole test for me.

Oh no?

No. I did some of it.

She smiles at him. He is no longer smiling back.

Well, next time I'd appreciate it if you

did all of it. OK?

You are so fair.

6 INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY. DAY. 6

TRACKING LISA from behind as she walks through the halls past

her fellow students. She walks through a door --

7 EXT. ALLEY. DAY -- CONTINUOUS. 7

-- where kids are smoking. Lots of butts on the ground. The

walls covered with graffiti. Lisa goes to her friend BECKY

and takes out her cigarettes. A kid named KURT smokes nearby.

What did he say to you?

Nothing. . .Mr Aaron and I have an

understanding about my math problem.

Becky laughs. Lisa laughs.

He is so appealing.

A long-haired kid comes out, followed by a somewhat preppier

girl, KIRSTEN, and her look-alike friend LESLIE.

OK, Mr Ferrar is such an asshole.

What'd he do, call on you?

Fuck you., Kurt.

Kirsten is really upset.

I'm sorry.

Let me have one of those, will you?

Leslie gives Kirsten a cigarette and lights it for her.

Kirsten, I didn't know you smoked.

I don't. -I'm just really angry. (to Leslie)

She drops her voice. They whisper and then both laugh. Lisa

watches them.

Are you serious?

Lisa overhears MONICA, an elegant 12th-grader, talking to

some other girls seated on the steps.

.I just don't think you can really know a

guy until you've slept with him.

Lisa, listening, is not so sure, but wouldn't know.

8 INT. AMERICAN HISTORY CLASS. DAY. 8

LEWIS, 30s. On the blackboard are scrawled the words

"STRIKERS" "PINKERTONS" and "PREZ. McKINLEY."

.So the President of the United States,

William B. McKinley, authorized the use of

private detectives to break the strike, and

they went out there and shot them down!

Just like they did in Virginia, just like

they did in Pennsylvania. Because they did

not care! They did not care!

(low, rumbling)

And that's basically it-That's basically

all there is to say.

All right? Go ahead, uhhhhh: Becky.

Well, Mr Klein...I mean, was there ever a

good President of the United States?

There is some laughter from the students.

I don't know, Becky. I think that's a good

question. What do you think? You. Lionel.

What do you think? Did we ever have a good

President?

Um...I don't know. I guess most of them

have just been totally corrupt.

Lisa?

Can I just say, I'm not necessarily like a

big fan of all the Presidents of the United

States, especially the current one, but I

still don't think its necessarily all that

useful to categorize every President as

universally corrupt, because that just

seems very general to me. Especially if

you're going to judge them by the standard

of -- whatever they're supposed to

traditionally be like in some mythical

version of America that probably never

existed to begin with.

ANTHONY, an intellectual smart-ass, leans back in his chair.

Lisa has raised a salient point.

There are some laughs from the class.

9 EXT. SCHOOL. DAY. 9

School is letting out. LISA walks away from the building. A

short energetic kid named DARREN falls in step with her.

Hey, how'd you do?

Oh hey Darren. It was fine. Thank you so

much.

So he didn't give you a hard time or

anything?

Well, he knows I'm not planning to like, go

into Mathematics or anything...He was

totally cool about it. He's so cool.

Oh yeah, everybody loves Mr Aaron.

What's that supposed to mean?

Nothing. The man is very lovable.

They stop at the corner.

What are you doing now?

I was gonna go look for a cowboy hat.

Why would you want to buy a cowboy hat?

Because my Dad is supposed to take me and

my brother to this ranch in New Mexico to

go horseback riding, and I don't think it

would be right to appear on horseback in

New Mexico without the appropriate

equestrian paraphernalia, Darren. You

wouldn't understand these things.

That is a definite possibility.

Anyway... Thanks again...

Before you venture forth on your bizarre

quest for a cowboy hat...?

Yes, Darren?

.what are you up to later? Like tonight.

I don't know.

You wanna go to a movie?

What do you mean, like on a date?

No, not on a date, just go to amovie.

I don't know if it's a fucking date!

All right. Calm down. What do you wanna

see?

I don't know, I don't even know what's

playing! I don't know if it's a date!

Let's just forget it! I hate the fuckin'

movies anyway. They're just bullshit.

They're all bullshit!

OK, take it easy, I was just asking! I'm

sorry!

be so horrendous?

me out? (Pause) Are you? (Pause) Hello...?

Earth to Darren.

I don't know. Yeah. I mean...I feel like

we're already really close...

Oh my God...

.and I think we'd be a really good match -

- What?

Nothing. This is -- Nothing.

So -- Yeah. I would. I mean, yes. I am.

Yes I am.

Wow. I mean -- I am really flattered. But I

would definitely not want to do anything to

mess up our friendship.

I view this as a way of strengthening our

friendship.

It would definitely change it...

I know: It's a fairly dangerous move.

Well...I would definitely have to think

about this...

Absolutely. Give it some thought.

OK, I will.

Pause. He is looking at her like he wants something.

Why do you look like that?

Like what?

What do you want from me?

Not a thing!

All right. I'll see you later.

All right.

She turns and walks away, pleased by the conversation.

10 EXT. LISA'S STREET -- WEST '80S. DAY. 10

apartment building.

11 INT. COHEN APARTMENT. DAY. 11

She lets herself into the narrow apartment. A long hall

covered with framed pictures, photographs and play posters

opens onto a cramped living room crammed with books, plays,

and magazines. A stereo, TV and computer are stuck in the

corners. Beyond this is the kitchen and another hallway

leading to the bathrooms and bedrooms.

Hello...!

Lisa drops her bag-and goes into the kitchen. She opens the

refrigerator. Her brother CURTIS, 11, comes in.

Hi.

Is Mom home?

She went to the store.

Lisa gets out some cold pizza and sits down with it.

Use a plate.

Don't be such a little fuckin' goody two-

shoes. -

Fuck you.

Please don't say "fuck," Curtis.

You just said it.

Yeah, that's because I know what it means.

So do I.

Uh, no you don't, Curtis. Take my word for

it.

What does it mean?

She looks at him and speaks very slowly and deliberately.

It's when a man puts his penis inside a

woman's vagina and moves it around really

fast until they both have an orgasm and he

ejaculates sperm inside her body.

Pause.

No it's not.

Yes it is.

Gross.

It is gross.

She eats. He watches her.

Do you want to play a game?

No.

Please!

I don't feel like it, Curtis. Quit bugging

me.

Can I have some pizza?

11A INT. LIVING ROOM. DAY. 11A

12 INT. LISA'S MOTHER'S BEDROOM. 12

Lisa, on her cell phone, rummages in her mother's bureau.

During the following she finds a small supply of cash and

steals forty dollars.

15 EXT. BROADWAY. DAY. 15

As Lisa slowly passes-by and looks in various store windows.

She stops and looks at some shoes.

REFLECTED IN THE WINDOW, behind her, a city BUS pulls up to a

bus stop and wheezes as the doors open.

16 EXT/INT STREET/BUS. SIMULTANEOUS. 16

kind of good-looking. Past the disembarking passengers we see

Lisa's back as she scans the shoe store.

ON LISA -- She turns around and sees the Bus Driver. She sees

his cowboy hat and just as the doors shut --

Hey!

The bus lurches away. Lisa takes off after it.

IN THE BUS -- CLOSE on the Bus Driver, oblivious to Lisa, who

we can see out the door and window, falling behind.

ON THE STREET -- The bus falls behind a slow-moving car and

Lisa catches up.

IN THE BUS -- Lisa appears at the bus doors, waving and

calling out. The Bus Driver sees her, smiles and waves back.

ON THE STREET -- Lisa is running alongside the bus.

Hey! Where'd you get your cowboy hat?

IN THE BUS -- The Bus Driver can't hear her, but smiles at

her with good-natured flirtatiousness.

ON THE STREET -- The LIGHT at the curb turns YELLOW.

THE SLOW-MOVING CAR in front of the bus floors it to make the

light.

THE BUS DRIVER sees his way is clear and steps on the gas.

He turns and waves goodbye to Lisa. She points at her head

and then at him. He smiles, not quite getting it.

The LIGHT turns RED.

Still looking at Lisa, the BUS DRIVER lifts the hat off his

head in a farewell salute as.--

LISA sees the bus pass under the RED LIGHT --

An Upper-West Side WOMAN, 40s or 50s (Later identified as

curb between two cars to cross Broadway.

THE BUS DRIVER turns his head to look straight forward.

POV BUS DRIVER -- Monica is directly in front of him.

POV MONICA -- The bus roars up at her.

THE BUS DRIVER slams on the BRAKES.

POV LISA -- Monica is clipped by the huge bus and pulled

tumbling underneath.

LISA SCREAMS. Pedestrians all over turn around.

MONICA is pulled and crunched in a horrible twisting tumble.

Everything stops.

TRACKING LISA fast as she runs across the street toward the

accident. As she gets closer she sees Monica's leg sticking

out from under the bus.

Then with some confusion, she realizes that Monica herself is

right in front of her, and that her blood is spreading

everywhere. Monica is reaching out vaguely, unable to speak.

She is making choking sounds.

Lisa stands over her for a second, frozen. She crouches down

and tries to do something but doesn't know what to do, where

to put her hands. Other people start converging.

IN THE BUS -- The Bus Driver puts the bus in Park, opens the

door and rushes out.

WE TRACK him as he comes around to where a crowd has already

formed. He hangs back on the outside, but we break through

till we find LISA kneeling next to the disoriented MONICA,

holding her hand. They are both covered in blood. Several

other people are shouting and talking all at once.

Somebody call an ambulance! Call an

ambulance! Everyone calm down!

I'm calling one right now...!

The Kid is already dialing his cell phone. Other people are

doing the same.

Get an ambulance!

Someone's calling one!

Ma'am, can you hear me? Can you hear me?

She holds onto the dead woman's hand and sobs. We see the BUS

DRIVER standing just beyond it. O.C., a SIREN wails

irrelevantly, stuck in traffic.

17 EXT. BROADWAY -- ACCIDENT SITE -- LATER. DAY. 17-

There are several cop cars now, an ambulance, a police

barrier, cops everywhere and a crowd of onlookers. Lisa is

giving a statement to DETECTIVE MITCHELL. She is completely

drenched in blood. Her clothes, boots,' everything. A FEW

YARDS AWAY the Bus Driver, very shaken, is giving his

statement to another cop (MOS), but also trying to hear what

Lisa is saying. Lisa keeps looking over at him.

OK, Lisa? Lisa? I just want to ask you a

couple of questions, OK?

OK, sure.

Now I want to ask you where you-were, and

what you saw when the accident took place.

Just tell me everything you saw, even if

you think it might not be important. OK?

Think of it like a movie. Like you're

watchin' a movie in your head, and all you

gotta do is tell me exactly what you see in

the movie. OK?

Yes. Thank you for the -- yes.

while it's still fresh in your mind. I know

this is hard for you. I'm just tryin' to do

my job, OK?

I understand! I don't mind, I'm just upset!

OK, Lisa, hang in there. You're doin'

great.

Could somebody call my mother?

We already called your Mom; but I'm gonna

have 'em put another call into your mother

right now, OK?

Yes. Please stop patronizing me.

I'm not tryin' to patronize you. I'm just

tryin' to get the information down while

it's fresh in your mind. I know some of

these questions might seem like they don't

make a lotta sense right now --

They do make sense. Just ask me!

Well, that's what I'm doin'. Now: I'm gonna

ask you: From where you're standing could

you see the traffic light? (Pause) Could

you see if it was red? Green? Yellow? Just

picture it in your mind. What color was the

light?

Lisa looks over at the Bus Driver. He looks back at her.

I guess it was green? I didn't really see

it. I think it was just an accident.

Behind the Bus Driver somebody moves from where they were,

and Lisa gets a clear view of the woman's covered body.

She goes down the hall and into her room. JOAN, her mother,

40s, appears from the kitchen.

Hello?

19 INT. LISA'S ROOM. DAY. 19

The room feels small and distorted. Odd. She starts to take

off her blood-soaked jacket, but her purse is over her

shoulder. She drops the purse and takes off the jacket.

She doesn't know what to do with it. She hangs it on the

closet door.

She sits on the bed and then gets up and looks at where she

sat. There's an imprint of blood on the white bedspread.

Good one, Lisa.

She starts breathing heavily. She goes into her bathroom --

20 INT. BATHROOM. CONTINUOUS. 20

She kneels down next to the toilet and opens it. She waits.

She throws up into the toilet. Joan knocks on the door.

Just a second!

She throws up again.

Oh my God, what happened to you?!?

It's OK, Mom, it's not my blood...!

Joan kneels down and tries to help her. Lisa screams and puts

her arms around her mother and cries.

Lisa is putting on a bathrobe. Her hair and body are still

matted and streaked with blood. Joan is picking up the bloody

She is very subdued.

bags.

What did they do with her leg?

I have no fucking idea.

Hey. Come on...

Oh, no thanks Mom. I mean thank you:

friends and admirers.

Thank you guys so much for coming...! It

was really great to see you...!

Colombian accent.

Hi -- are you Ramon?

Yes. Hello. You were wonderful -- again.

You're so sweet, thank you. And thank you

for the beautiful flowers...!

Oh you're very welcome. I hope you didn't

mind...

No, I'm very flattered. And you've seen the

show before...?

Yes, two times.

Gosh. That's very -- That's a lot!

Oh no. It's a beautiful performance. And I

think it's still in previews...?

Yeah, we're on kind of a weird schedule...

I think you will have a big success.

Well, at the moment we're just trying to

focus on what we're doing...

I don't know if you are busy, but will you

allow me to -buy you a drink? There's a

place right down the street... If you like

to ask your friends... or if you didn't eat

dinner...

Joan sees Lisa sitting across the room waiting.

Oh -- No -- thank you. I can't. I'm just on

my way home.

OK, it's no problem. Tomorrow I'm going to

London for a few days on business. Perhaps

when I come back...

Um -- Well --

If it's not convenient, it's no problem.

No no no, it's OK, um -- Yeah.

I will send a word backstage? Or if you

like to --

Oh -- no, anything's fine. I'm sorry. I

really have to go --

It's no problem.

Anyway, thank you so much for the flowers!

It's a privilege to meet you.

They shake hands. She heads over to Lisa as Ramon heads for

the stairs to leave the theater.

I thought you were at the movies...!

Yeah... It wasn't very good. Who's that?

I don't know. He sent me flowers.

Go out with him.

glances at Lisa, checking to see if this frivolity is really

helpful or not such a good idea.

King Lear. The teacher, JOHN, is a rather high-strung

slightly harsh enthusiast with glasses and a beard.

Matthew, if you would read France... And

Anthony, you read Burgundy...

(With mock relish)

Ah. Burgundy.

37 INT. UPPER WEST SIDE DINER. DAY. 37

NEIGHBORHOOD LADIES, 70s, sit in a booth nearby.

If you didn't want to go to the movies

alone with-me Friday, you could have just

told me that. You didn't need to bring

Becky along as your bodyguard.

I didn't bring her as a bodyguard.

Oh, he's wonderful. He drives all the way

to see her every Saturday.

Then why did you?

Who's gonna steal him?

NEIGHBORHOOD LADY 1 Like what?

Who's gonna steal him?

NEIGHBORHOOD LADY 1 Just everything.

That's what I said.

NEIGHBORHOOD LADY 2 But what specifically is

What's the name of it? fucked up?

NEIGHBORHOOD LADY 1 LISA (very low)

It's called a bull terrier. Nothing.

No, what's the name of the dog?

Barnaby.

The two ladies keep on talking.

(Very low, eyes down)

So...I've been thinking about your

suggestion...

Uh huh...?

I guess I_don't think it's a very good

idea.

Why not?

I guess I don't feel that way about you.

But those kinds of feelings can develop. I

definitely feel like there's a connection

there.

I know there is.

I just think you're scared. I'think you're

scared of your own feelings. I think you've

been hurt in the past by other guys and I

think what it would feel like to have a

real feeling is really terrifying to you.

She wipes her eyes because tears are running down her cheeks

What's the matter? (Pause) What's the

matter?

She won't look at him. O.C. AUDIENCE APPLAUSE takes us to:

38 INT.-BAR/RESTAURANT. NIGHT.

Joan and Ramon are having a drink at a small table.

My family are from Colombia... My.father

worked in the diplomatic service...

Really. Wow.

I grew up five years in Panama, four years

in Holland, then nine years in Paris. After

I finish university, I moved back to

Colombia. So: when I'm speaking French,

they think I'm Spanish. When I'm speaking

Spanish, they think I'm french.

And what do you do, Ramon?

I have a company: We design computer

software to help companies in South

American countries.that use an incompatible

software, so the computers can't talk to

each other. It's a big problem in Central

and South America, where there is not

usually so much coordination in computer

communications. So right now there's a big

opportunity for us, because for the big

software companies it's still in the

backwoods. That's changing already, but in

the last ten years we have done extremely

well. It's the next ten years we're going

to see what happens.

Uh huh? God...

Mom...?

Just a second!

(opening the door)

Can I come in?

Just one second, honey. Hold on! (covering

herself up) Come in.

Lisa comes in and sits on the edge of the bed.

Can I talk to you?

Sure. What's up.

How was the show...?

It was OK. Are you all right?

Not really.

What's wrong?

Mom...I have to tell you something.

OK.

42 EXT. NIGHT. FROM ACROSS THE STREET. SIMULTANEOUS. 42

A slow pan across the building. We pick out Lisa talking to

Joan in one little window.

43 INT. JOAN'S ROOM. NIGHT. A MINUTE LATER. 43

They sit there. Long pause.

So what do you think I should do?

Well...it doesn't sound like it was

anybody's fault...

But don't you think I should say something

to them now?

I don't know, sweetie. I mean, that bus

driver probably has a family to support

.He could probably lose his job...So I

think you should really think about that

before you say anything ... You might end up

feeling even worse...

Lisa was not expecting this response and doesn't like it.

OK...

Joan isn't sure what she's done wrong.

OK...?

KLEIN (O.C.)

Think of the implications of what you're

saying!

44 INT. HISTORY CLASS. DAY. 44

ANGIE, a Syrian-American girl, has her hand up.

.I'm saying what is the frame of

reference for the average Arab on the

street? Angie!

Yeah, my family is from Syria? And I just

want to say that Americans have no idea

how much people hate them all over the

world. OK?

We don't?

And all my relatives in Syria think that

what we did in Afghanistan was terrorism.

Not to mention Iraq...

Syria is a theocratic military

dictatorship.

Um, no it's not: Sorry.

Syria is not a theocratic military

dictatorship?

Um, I think we have a pretty good idea how

much people hate us now actually, Angie.

No we don't.

One at a time --

They blew up our city, OK? So yeah, I think

we have a pretty good idea, and personally

I don't give a shit.

There is some laughter from the class.

You should!

2nd Blue Revised 10/28/05 - Page 31

-- because the people who blew up the World

Trade Center were a bunch of sick monsters -

Oh they were monsters?

Yes!

Why? Because they're Arabs?

No, because they killed three thousand

people for no reason.

Hey, hey, one at a time...!

They want to establish a medieval Islamic

Western civilization.

Oh, where did you read that?

It's on their website.

Okay, forget it.

Angie!

No! Forget it!

Go ahead with what you were saying!

No! Why should I?

But why are you defending somebody who

murdered three thousand people!

I'm not! Why are you defending a country

that unilaterally invaded two Muslim

countries and supports the Israeli

occupation of Palestine?!

The class ROARS.

Oh give me a break!

-- and drops bombs on women and children

and then calls other people terrorists for

doing the exact same thing!

OK -- OK -- Because it's not same

thing!

Yes it is!

Lionel! Go ahead.

Yeah, I just want to ask like, why is OK to

drop bombs on men, but it's not OK to drop

bombs on women and children? Isn't that

just reverse sexism?

I don't know. That's an interesting point.

I agree it's a bullshit term.

This is totally stupid.

(Looking for hands)

Uhhhhhh...Monica!

Yeah, I think this whole class should

apologize to Angie, because all she did was

express her opinion about what her

relatives in Syria think about the fact

that we bombed the shit out of a

practically medieval culture --

Thank you!

-- and everybody started screaming at her

like she was defending the Ku Klux Klan!

They are the Ku Klux Klan! They like to

throw acid in women's faces!

Who does? The Afghanistans? Why don't you drop bombs --

Afghanies? The Iraqis? Then why don't you drop

LISA Because they're white?

Yes! No! The Taliban!

ANTHONY you, Lisa!

The correct term is Afghans.

But I'm not even saying I disagree with

you! I'm only saying I think it's pathetic

the way people in this class treated Angie

just for saying something they don't agree

with.

Because that's censorship, right? Right?

Yeah! (a joke:) Right on! It's not censorship...!

Thank you... !

true. It's censorship.

Oh my God, no it's not!

OK...?

it's not too serious...

I'm fine. I'm good. Things are picking up a

boyfriend situation?

Oh the same. They're all kind of the same.

Uh huh? Well, next time you come out here

I'll try to hook you up with some more

interesting people than you seem to be

meeting at the moment.

Thanks, Dad, I don't really go for the

California type.

Well -- I don't either, per se. It

somewhat depends on who it is, obviously...

Hard to argue with. I think I'll stop

generalizing,now...!

OK. Well, that's about all on my end, babe.

I'll give you a call in a week or two. Give

my love to Curtis, and say hello to your

Mom.

OK, I can't wait for our trip.

Yeah. I think we're gonna have a really

54 INT. CAB (MOVING) NIGHT. 54

Joan and Lisa sit silently in the rattling cab.

What did you think of the play?

It was OK.

Silence.

Well, thank you, honey.

What do you want me to say? JOAN

I thought it was OK! Nothing! You said it!

Next time I'll lie!

Don't come next time!

I won't!

55 INT. STUDENT LOUNGE - OUTSIDE THE THEATER OFFICE. DAY. 55

PAUL, a droll handsome senior, is holding court, feet up on a

desk, an unlit cigarette in his hand.

Yeah, like I would be in a movie, only I

would be doing exactly what I'm doing right

now: like I'd be sitting here smoking a

cigarette, and I'd have my feet up on. the

desk, but the camera would be on me and I'd

just be acting, except I wouldn't do

anything differently from how I'm doing it

right now.

Nearby, BECKY and LISA are looking at a poster for "Guys and

Dolls." It says "ONLY 3 WEEKS BEFORE THIS EARTH-SHATTERING

MUSICAL EXTRAVAGANZA HITS THE EMERSONIAN STAGE!

I still don't get why you didn't even

audition. You're such a good singer.

I still might do lights or something. But

I'm not gonna make a fuckin' ass out of

myself parading around in a play so I can

ask everyone how great I was for three

years afterwards like my fuck-ass mother.

56 EXT. ALLEY. DAY. 56

Everyone is smoking. Lisa is holding forth to some girls.

Did I tell you guys I saw a woman get her

leg cut off by a bus?

What? Really? Are you kidding?

Check out my boots.

Oh my God! What happened? Where were you?

What did you see, etc?

Becky looks at Lisa, surprised and hurt that this is the

first she's hearing about this.

56A INT. THEATER RESTAURANT. NIGHT. 56A

58 INT. BECKY'S ROOM. NIGHT. 58

Becky and Lisa are smoking pot. They are dolled up.

Are you aware that things have gotten to

the point where I now have to hear things

about you from other people and I can't

even correct them because I no longer have

any first-hand information about you

myself?

What are you talking about?

Nothing. I just feel like we used to be

really close -- like, up until a few days

ago. And I'm not really getting that from

you anymore.

Becky. Give me a break.

Pause.

I can't believe you just said that to me.

That was really hard for me to say, and

that's you response?

Can we just go please?

Fine. Would you like to smoke any more of

my pot before we leave or have you had as

much as you want now?

Oh, I'd like to have a little bit more

please.

Fine. Get fuckin' out of my house!

Fine. But this is totally stupid because

we're both going to the same party.

59 INT. PARTY HOUSE -- BATHROOM. NIGHT. 59

The door opens and we catch a glimpse of a big party in a

brownstone full of circulating kids. LISA and PAUL cram into

the bathroom and shut the door again.

A MOMENT LATER - She is sitting on the toilet. He is on the

hamper unscrewing a small vial of coke-.

It's very hard to be cool under these

circumstances.

You don't have to be cool. All youhaveto

do is snort it up your nose.

I'll try...!

He gives her the spoon. She snorts it.

And then you wanna do the other nostril

because you always want to be symmetrical.

Very important.

She snorts some up the other nostril. Paul does some too and

closes the vial. _

Symmetry.

You are so funny...! (Pause) So what do we

do now?

Now we make out.

Paul...! What about your girlfriend?

I'm sorry. It just sounded like you just

asked me about my girlfriend.

Oh, never mind...

They make out. He immediately starts feeling her up. She

pushes his hand away.

You're not serious.

Oh... No.

He moves his hand back. She lets him.

60 INT. PARTY HOUSE -- STAIRWELL. NIGHT. 60

Lisa comes down around the stairs at a mellow drunken pace.

She sees Darren sitting by himself on the floor at the end of

a dark hallway. She walks over' to him and crouches down.

Hey... You know I really love you, right?

Not really.

Pause. She kisses him softly and they make out for a minute.

I guess I'm not very consistent.

I don't mind.

He kisses her again. She draws back slightly.

I gotta go home.

OK...

61 INT. RAMON'S BATHROOM. NIGHT. 61

Joan sits on the toilet seat naked, smoking, hair tousled, a

little overexcited. Ramon KNOCKS. She jumps.

RAMON (O.C.)

Joan? Are you all right?

Yes! Fine! Be out in a sec.

She gets up, flushes the cigarette, looks in the mirror,

tousles her hair, snaps off the light and opens the door.

63 INT. GEOMETRY CLASS. DAY. 63

The. last students file out except Lisa. Mr. Aaron is erasing

the blackboard.

Yes, Becky? Um -- Lisa?

Are you still mad at me about the test?

What's going on, Lisa?

64 INT. GEOMETRY CLASS - A FEW MINUTES LATER. DAY. 64

Lisa and Mr Aaron sit at his desk.

.Because maybe my mother is right, and

the bus driver is completely devastated as

it is. And I'm just gonna be this little

rich girl who calls up the cops to ease her

conscience, and then ends up ruining

somebody's life, when I'm the one who was

distracting him in the first place.

anything?

Oh my God, I don't mean literally rich. My

Dad makes like one bad TV commercial like,

every two years, and my Mom lives from

like, voice-Over to Voice Over. I mean rich

compared to the bus driver.

OK...But I still don't see what any of that

has to do with what you do or don't want to

tell the investigating officers about the

accident you witnessed.

Nothing, I guess. I'm sorry. When you're

raised to be a knee-jerk Liberal you tend

to think about these things.

Lionel and a girl open the door.

Lionel? Tamara? It's gonna be five minutes.

I just thought you'd want to know there's

like a lot of people out here and it's

getting kind of hard to breathe.

You better close that door now, Lionel.

Lionel closes the door.

MR AARON (CONT'D)

All right: I have to let those guys in.

I don't want to leave you hanging...If

you're really hurtin'...we could get a cup

of coffee after school...

66 INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT. 66

Lisa is watching TV. Joan comes in dressed for the opera.

Does this-make me look fat?

Um, a little.

Well, there's nothing I can do about it.

Where are you going?

The opera...!

Why are you going to the opera?

It turns out he's a really big opera

fan...! Anyway, don't you think it's kind

of fun? We should all go sometime.

Uh, no thanks.

Why not? I bet you'd like it.

I don't like that kind of singing.

But you like classical music.

Yes. That's true. But I don't like opera

singing.

But when have you ever -- It's like their entire reason

for existing is to prove how

loud they can be. I don't

really find that all that

interesting.

Yeah. I know what you mean. But it's not

all like that. You like The Magic Flute.

OK. I guess I'm wrong. I guess I do like

opera singing. I just didn't realize it.

What is the matter with you?

Nothing at all! Why are you pushing this? I

don't want to go to the opera!

Yes! OK! It's called an invitation. I'm not

pushing anything! All you have say is "No

thanks!"

I did! And then you were like, "Why not?"

So then I told you, and then you started

like, debating me! Like you assume I've

never thought this through for myself!

Which I have! Many times!

OK, well, that was a really Contemptuous

assumption on my part. I don't actually

like the opera that much myself. But I'm

trying to expand my mind. Maybe that's

wrong! (Pause) I'm sorry. I guess I'm a

Ramon.

Why? What's the big deal? Why are you so

influenced by what me and Curtis think?

What Curtis and I think.

Because obviously if I'm seeing somebody

new it would important to me that you guys

would like him and that he like you. Why

wouldn't I be nervous about that?

I guess you would. Withdrawn.

Hey...Why does everything I say annoy you?

Jesus Christ, I'm just sitting here!

Here: you be me, and say anything, and I'll

respond the way you've been responding to

me this whole conversation.

No...!

Go ahead: say something to LISA

me and I'll say something No! I'm not gonna do

to you the way you say that.

everything to me -- Why not?

Because it's dumb! I'm horrible! I get your

point!

"OK, uh, whatever."

Was that supposed to be an imitation of me?

"Um, OK: Withdrawn."

Well, for someone who's supposed to be a

professional actress that's a pretty lame-

ass impersonation of someone in your own

family.

Lisa shakes her head and watches the TV. Pause.

Are you coming to my opening night?

I will if I have to.

Pause.

You're a little cunt, do you know that?

Yes. You're a big cunt.

OK. Let's not start talking to each other

that way.

You just called me a cunt, Mom!

OK, I'm sorry I said that. LISA

But if you're really Why? It's refreshing!

-- If you're really saying you're not aware

that you've been really annoyed with me, or

really irritable with me -- and it doesn't

matter if_I express it exactly accurately:

you know what I'm trying to say --!

Not really.

if you're saying you're completely

unaware of that, then I have to say I don't

think you're being honest about it. Now

maybe I'm doing something really horrible

to you without being aware of it, but I

have a show opening in two weeks, I'm very

nervous about it, I'm seeing a new person

and I'm obviously anxious about you and

Curtis liking him -- whether you think I

should be or not! -- you were involved in a

horrible traumatic accident, you're going

on this crazy horseback riding trip with

your father --

Oh my God!

-- which sounds like a recipe for disaster

to me! And on top of everything else, Lisa,

ever since I told you about Ramon you've

been treating me like I'm insane!

Um, I think you're exaggerating slightly.

Now what am I supposed to do?!

What am I supposed to do?!

Just stop whining about everything! It

doesn't matter. Norte of that matters at

all! You've been in a million plays, you

always get freaked out because of what some

dumb critic is gonna say about your dumb

play, I don't frankly give a shit about

Ramon or who you're going out with

this week --

I never go out with anyone! LISA

Don't talk to me that way! Right! I don't care!

I've barely had a date in the

last two years!

But I don't care about any of this! It

doesn't matter! Your boyfriend doesn't

matter! Your play doesn't matter, except

to you! I don't care about New Mexico,

because to tell you the truth I'm probably

not even going --

What do you mean?

-- and you want to know something else,

Mom? There are more important problems in

the world than our relationship! There's a

whole city out there full of people who are

dying! So who cares if I like your fucking

boyfriend? It's so trivial! Why are you

bothering me about all this? It doesn't

matter!!!

Pause. The intercom buzzer buzzes. Joan hesitates.

Well -- should I have him come up now?

Or should I have him wait downstairs...?

Do whatever you want. I don't care!

I don't even know what we're talking about.

I know you don't. That's the problem.

Oh give me a break.

67 EXT. LINCOLN CENTER. NIGHT. 67

Ramon and Joan walk toward the Metropolitan Opera House.

Everything is all right?

Oh, yeah. I'm so excited to be going to the

opera! I don't think I've really gone more

than one or two times!

Well, I wish it wasn't Norma but it's still

fun to go.

What if we just went to see something else

instead?

You don't want to hear Norma?

No -- I don't mean that. I just meant

wouldn't it be funny if we just walked into

one of the other events, like if we just

went to see the Daniel Goldfarb play

instead.

I think you will enjoy this.

Lisa dials a phone number off a slip of paper. The line

rings. WE CUT BETWEEN THEM.

(answering the phone)

Yo.

Hey, Paul.

Hey.

It's Lisa Cohen.

Yeah, how's it going?

OK. (Pause) What have you been up to?

Seeing some questionable movies. Not

deciding where to go to college...

Sounds good...(Pause) So...I was just

thinking...This is gonna sound really

queer, but...by any chance would you want

to meet somewhere and like, take away my

virginity?

Um...all right.

Really? God, I'm so flattered.

To what do I owe this inconceivable honor?

Actually it's because of my deep passionate

feelings for you, Paul.

That's pretty much what I figured...(Pause)

So, do you want to come over here? Should I

come over there...?

Well, my Mom just went out for the

evening...Except my little brother's

getting dropped off at some point, come to

think of it, so I'm actually supposed to be

here when he gets home.

It's 252 West 85th Street...

70 INT. DARREN'S ROOM/LISA'S ROOM. NIGHT. 70

Darren lies on his bed, depressed. He dials the phone.

(on the phone)

Hello?

Hey. What are you up to?

Hey, nothing. Writing my King Lear paper.

Really? That's impressive.

Not really.

I've just never known you to be so devoted

to your studies before.

Well, I don't want to fail Humanities.

You're not gonna fail Humanities.

No, probably not.

So what did you do tonight?

Actually, Darren...I don't really feel like

talking right now.

Pause.

OK.

OK?

Yeah. I'll talk to you later.

OK.

OK, bye.

Bye.

Darren hangs up and starts crying.

71 INT. HALL. NIGHT. 71

Lisa, dressed up a little and wearing some makeup, opens the

door for Paul. He's not dressed up at all. He's smoking.

Hey.

Hey, come in.

She steps aside. He passes her and comes in.

I think I-just alienated one of your

neighbors by smoking in the elevator.

Oh really? What did they say?

She basically said there was no smoking in

the elevator.

That's original...

TRACKING them as they come into the living room...

So this is the living room.

Very livable.

We like it...My Mom hasn't read any of

these books, by the way.

Have you?

Some of them. Not all of them.

Paul looks at The Rise And Fall Of The Third Reich.

This book is a very cool book.

Yeah, I think the Third Reich may be a

little bit too much for me right now.

It's pretty hard to put down once you get

started. -

Do you want anything to drink?

I'd take a beer.

72 INT. KITCHEN. NIGHT. 72

Lisa has two beers out and is looking through drawers.

OK, I have no idea where the bottle opener

is. -

Here, lemme have them.

He takes the beers and opens them on the edge of the counter.

He makes two marks in the counter doing this.

Thanks.

Whoops. I think I just permanently damaged

your kitchen counter. Sorry.

Oh -- that's OK. Don't worry about it.

Won't your "Mother" be "Upset?"

How come everything you say always sounds

so ironic? You don't even have to do

anything and it just comes out sounding

like, totally ironic and funny.

It's just a gift.

She laughs nervously. They drink beer.

So...do you want to see my room?

Sure.

73 INT. LISA'S ROOM. NIGHT. 73

They come into her room. She closes the door.

This is my room. Ta da.

Very nice.

She realizes she has some stuffed animals on the bed.

And these are my stuffed animals.

Always important to meet the stuffed

animals.

These are some drawings I did...Not that I

should be showing them to you, because I

know you're like a really good artist,

right?

I would like to be a really good artist.

At this point I think it would be more

accurate to say I'm good at drawing.

Yeah, I just do it for fun. But I've always

really liked it...

He looks at her pictures.

So...can I ask you a question?

Yes?

This is probably gonna sound very immature,

but how can you be so relaxed, knowing what

we're about to do? Or is it just like no

big deal to you? (Pause) OK, that was a

really stupid question and I'm like totally

embarrassed right now. I'm actually more

embarrassed than I've ever been in my life.

If you want to go home now that's totally

OK.

Easy there. Don't be embarrassed. It's

basically like, the world's greatest

activity, but it's not actually worth

getting nervous about.

Yeah: I don't usually get nervous because I

think it's worth it: I usually get nervous

because I can't help the way I feel.

Although I do think that if anything is

worth getting nervous about, it's this. But

maybe that's just really idealistic of me.

There is that philosophy.

You are so funny...!

Do you have an ashtray?

Oh you can just chuck it out the window.

Paul struggles to open the window and tosses his cigarette.

He closes the window and comes across the room to kiss her.

Are we starting?

I was thinking about it, yeah.

And am I being really dorky right now?

You're not suave.

I'm sorry. I guess I'm a little nervous.

Please ignore.

Don't be nervous. I promise this is gonna

be a great experience for you. You're

gonna have like four, five hundred orgasms

at least.

He kisses her. They make out.

OK, let's talk about your kissing. Don't

panic. It's just a technical thing.

Lisa collapses with her face in the bed out of shame.

What are you like the nicest guy in the

world?

74 INT. LISA'S ROOM. NIGHT. LATER. 74

Like that?

(Not quite but close enough)

Yes...

in I supposed to go really fast at the end

or something?

Yeah, but we're gonna move on before

He shifts around and tries to go down on her.

You don't have to do that.

I know. I want to.

Pause. She slides up away from him.

Don't do that, OK? I'm just embarrassed.

Let me do it to you.

All right.

75 INT. LISA'S ROOM. LATER. 75

He is positioning himself on top of her.

Are you ready?

Yeah.

OK. This is a little tricky: It's probably

gonna hurt a little, at first, but then

it's gonna get better...Just be patient.

There are certain technical difficulties on

my end that have to be addressed or it's

not gonna happen.

OK: You sound insane.

They laugh.

OK, ready?

Yeah.

OK?

Mm hm.

OK, hang on...

Ow!

OK -- There we go. Does it hurt now?

Kind of, yeah.

OK, just try to relax. It'll get better in

a second...

Did you bring a condom?

Uh huh...

Shouldn't you put it on?

I will in a second.

This is really kind of hurting.

OK -- one second.

I love you.

What?

Nothing.

OK -- hold on -- Shit --

What?

OK, one second -- Ohh! Sorry -- Sorry --

He comes inside her. Silence. He carefully rolls over.

Sorry about that. Kind of got away from me.

Did any of it get inside me?

I don't know.

Yeah. It definitely did.

Honest to God? It's probably OK. The odds

are overwhelmingly that it's OK.

O.C. the doorbell rings.

That's my little brother.

She gets a bathrobe and goes out. We TRACK HER through the

whole apartment. She opens the door for CURTIS.

Hi, Curtis.

Hi.

We TRACK her back to her room. She shuts the door. PAUL has

put on his underwear and is smoking a cigarette.

Hey.

Hey. (sits down) Can I have a drag? (takes

(gives it back to him) I'm actually kind of

mad at you...

Why? (Pause) Why? (Pause) Because we didn't

use birth control?

I guess so.

It was at the ready...

Well, I don't really want to get AIDS, you

know? And I really don't want to have an

abortion, because I know when you have one

at my age it, can be really hard to get

pregnant later on, and I definitely want to

have children some day.

Didn't you ever hear of the "Morning After

The Guy Came Too Fast Pill?"

Oh, the "I'm A Total Fucking Moron" Pill?

Well...that's the Canadian name.

Yes. I prefer not to put too many chemicals

inside my body if I can avoid it. I'm sure

it's fine...Or not...!

Try to listen to me. Right about now is

when you're traditionally supposed to freak

out. So why don't you just not? You're not

gonna get AIDS, because I don't have AIDS --

How do you know? Have you been tested?

No, but I'm pretty sure I don't have it,

because of my demographic. And the odds are

you're probably not gonna have to have an

abortion either. And since this was your

first time, it might as well be a basically

happy memory instead of a shitty one.

I'm sorry. I'm not completely in control of

my emotions. (Pause) Anyway...Thank you for

deflowering me.

You're welcome.

Did it freak you out that I said I love

you?

No...It didn't freak me out.

You don't have to say it back, because I

know you probably have like no feelings at

all for me.

I think I_just proved I have some feelings

for you.

You should probably go now...

76 INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT. 76

That's my brother.

What's up?

Hi.

Lisa walks Paul to the front door.

77 INT. LISA'S ROOM. NIGHT. 77

She changes into her pajamas.

79 INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT. 79

80 INT. METROPOLITAN OPERA. NIGHT. 80

The audience applauds the opera cast thunderously. Near Joan

and Ramon a male opera enthusiast is standing.

81 EXT. LINCOLN CENTER. NIGHT. 81

Joan and Ramon walk arm in arm away from Lincoln Center.

Oh, I loved it! It was so exciting!

Good! We should go again!

But how about those people yelling "Bravi!"

and "Brava!"

How do you mean?

It's just so pretentious. "Bravi!" "Bravi!"

Why can't they just say "Bravo?"

Well, it's the plural.

I know --

It's the plural of "bravo." It's what they

say to acknowledge the ensemble.

No, I know, I know it's correct, it just --

don't you think there was something a

little pretentious about those people?

Pretentious?

I don't mean they didn't really enjoy

it...But you know how you can really be

enjoying something -- but you're also kind

of looking around out of the corner of your

eye -- because you know people are watching

you enjoy it...? Does that make sense at

all?

Yes, but I wouldn't say that it was

pretentious. In Italian you say "Bravo" for

a man and "Brava" for a woman, and "Bravi"

for the whole company.

Uh huh? OK, I see what you mean.

You use the masculine for the male singer

and the feminine for the female singer.

Yeah...Anyway, I really enjoyed it. Thank

you.

We'll have to go again.

It was so glamorous...!

82 INT. SCHOOL THEATER -- LIGHTING BOOTH. DAY. 82

Lisa is on a headset. Below, on the stage MATTHEW is singing

to a girl.

"My time of day is the dark time..."

Cue thirty-six, go.

GARY THE THEATER TEACHER (O.C.)

OK, hold up a second.

OK, we're gonna do that one more time

please. Let's back it up please...

Why are we stopping?

83 INT. SCHOOL THEATER. NIGHT. 83

All the kids in the show are sitting more or less in a

circle. GARY the theater teacher, 30s, has the floor.

Now I know there's been a lot of shit going

on between a lot of the people in this

room..But I wanna tell you something:

You've worked too fucking hard for this

show to be derailed now by the kind of

bullshit I know has been going on around

here. Now, I'll bet you there's not one

person working on this show who hasn't got

somebody they want to say something to,

including me. So I'm gonna start. Matthew?

By "Matthew," I assume you mean me?

Yes. I mean you.

Matthew comes slowly into the middle of the circle.

Yes?

You are probably one of the most talented

kids who's ever performed at this school.

But you're too Goddamn lazy, you think you

can just waltz through this part, and it's

pissing me off. Because this show cannot

come together until you learn your fucking

lines. OK? _

So you'd like me to memorize them.

Everyone laughs.

Yes, I'd like you to memorize them!

Now. (Brightly) Your turn!

But I'm not mad at anyone. I just want

everyone to think I'm a great guy.

Everyone laughs.

83A INT. SCHOOL THEATER. NIGHT. LATER. 83A

BECKY and LISA are in the circle,'both crying.

But I'm jealous of you...

Why would you be jealous of me...!

Because of everything! 'Cause you always

get such good grades and your family never

has to worry about money, and your parents

are still together, and I'm really jealous

of your other friends!

Well, I'm really sorry if I hurt you!

83A CONTINUED: 83A

Me too!

They embrace tearfully. Many of the kids are moved. Some are

not. Becky leaves Lisa in the circle. Lisa wipes her eyes.

Darren...?

Darren unglues himself from his perch on a table, and sits in

the circle with her.

I know that I'm not who you want me to be

to you. And I know how much I've hurt you.

But I still can't believe it means we can't

be friends anymore! So much has been

happening to me this semester --

I know. I know.

-- and it's like I can't even talk to

you about it because I hurt you so bad!

Yes you can. Of course you can. You can

talk to me about anything.

I don't love anybody more than you!

You're practically my best friend!

I love you too. I really do...!

They hug and cry. LESLIE raises her hand.

Leslie?

Can I just say, I think this show is like

two and a half seconds away from being

fucking amazing, and if we could all just

work together, instead of being AT each

other all the time, I think we could all

just be incredible.

Everyone applauds, except ANGIE, who raises her hand.

83A CONTINUED: (2) 83A

Yeah. (Long pause) Yeah. I'm gonna say it.

I feel really fucked over by some of the

people in this room. I'm not saying I'm not

gonna do my job, but for some reason, a lot

of the actors in this show seem to think

that this whole show is about them. And I

think I speak for a lot of the techies when

I say that I feel really unappreciated and

basically fucked over. And I don't know if

I can get over it. I don't. That's all.

Nobody says anything. PAUL raises a hand. His pretty

GIRLFRIEND is seated next to him.

Yes, Paul?

Yeah, I'm just playing in the band, you

know? This is hicrh school. You know? I

don't really feel a strong need to like,

all be on the same team with everybody.

I just want to come to rehearsals, do the

show, go up on the roof and smoke some pot,

and then like, go on home. I don't really

wanna cry and hug anybody.

There are laughs and some cheers.

Oh you wanna hug me a little, don't you

Paul?

OK, Gary, man, I'll give you a little hug.

No kissin' though.

Gary charges over and hugs Paul. Everyone laughs and claps.

Gary grabs Paul's face and kisses him on the cheek. Everyone

is laughing.

Lisa looks at Paul, who settles back with his girlfriend. He

sees Lisa looking at him and gives her a little salute. Lisa

catches DARREN's eye. He is looking at her with the unwelcome

gaze of love. She looks away. His heart hardens against her.

84 INT. COHEN KITCHEN. DAY. 84

Lisa is at the breakfast table, looking through a stack of

back issues of The New York Times. She finds the item she

UPPER WEST-SIDE WOMAN KILLED IN BUS

ACCIDENT. Monica Patterson, a long-time

Upper West Sider, was struck by and killed

by a city bus Friday afternoon on Broadway.

The bus driver, Gerald Maretti, was not at

fault, police said...

85 INT. COHEN APARTMENT. LIVING ROOM./INT. HIGHWAY ONE POLICE 85

STATION. DAY.

Lisa is on-the phone. Curtis is watching TV.

Accident Investigation. Detective Mitchell.

Hi, my name-is Lisa Cohen. I was a witness

in a bus accident case a few weeks ago...

Yeah, hi, Lisa, what can I do for you?

Well, this is probably gonna sound a little

weird, but are you allowed to tell me how

to get in touch with that woman's family?

I'm obviously probably too late to go to

the funeral, but I really wanted to send

some flowers or something.

Yeah, I can --

Or is that like classified information?

No no. Family's been notified...Lemme see

what I got.

She mentioned she had a daughter...

Lemme just... OK: I don't have anything for

a daughter. The only contact I have is a

cousin, Abigail Berwitz. I got a number in

Arizona...

So did you have the trial, or whatever?

Or did you make the -- did they have a

ruling yet?

Yes. It was, uh, No Criminality found.

OK?

No Criminality.

Right.

Wow. That's a -- great system you got.

OK. Wow.

86 INT. LISA'S ROOM./INT. ABIGAIL'S HOUSE. DAY. 86

Yes, I'm trying to reach Abigail Berwitz?

This is Abigail.

Hi, my name is Lisa Cohen. You don't know

me...I...

Yes? Hello?

Hi. Sorry. Yeah. I was actually calling

about your cousin, Monica Patterson?

OK...?

I was actually there when she had --

during the accident. I didn't know her, but

I was the one who was with her when she

died...

OK...?

Yeah. I was sort of holding her hand at the

time...

Yes? What can I do for you?

OK. Well, ummm, I saw her obituary in the

paper, but I didn't see anything about

a funeral. I assume they had one, because --

No. As far as I know they're doing

something or other next week. But --

I'm sorry: and I was also wondering, she

said something about her daughter?

No. Her daughter -- She wanted someone

No -- Her's daughter's to get ahold of her?

not alive -- She -- I'm sorry:

passed away quite

a long time ago.

Oh my God. Was it...Was she sick? Or was

She had leukemia.

Oh my gosh. And -- do you mind if I ask:

Was her name Lisa?

Yes...?

OK, see, that explains it. See, I think

she thought --

Could I just interrupt? How did you get

this number?

Oh -- the police -- I asked the Accident

Investigating investigator who to contact

if I wanted to --

Well they really shouldn't be giving out my

number. (blurts out) This is harassment!

I'm sorry! -I'm not trying to harass

I have been getting calls about this for

three weeks! One of Monica's neighbors gave

the police my number and all of a sudden I

am the focal point for all these

arrangements! And I gotta tell you people,

I didn't have any kind of relationship with

Monica whatsoever, unless you want to count

the fact that she held up my children's

inheritance for fifteen years. I guess

we're just supposed to forget about all

that now. And I am more than willing. But

the perso n you should be calling is Emily

Morrison, who was Monica's friend and is

the person who has been dealing with all of

this in New York. But it has nothing to do

with me.

I'm sorry! I didn't really know who to

Now I can give you her number, but I would

very much appreciate it if the calls would

stop.

Yes -- Please. Can you hold on while I get

a pen?

Yes, all right.

87 INT. EMILY'S APARTMENT/COHEN APARTMENT. DAY. 87

EMILY MORRISON, 40s, is on the phone in her Upper West Side

apartment. She's on the phone with Lisa.

I guess it would be all right ...It's only

going to be a few close friends, and some

clients I imagine...

Oh so was she a lawyer?

Monica? No. She was a social worker. She

used to be, anyway. She had -- several

careers.

Were you really good friends with her?

Yes I was.

88 INT. COHEN APARTMENT. DAY. 88

89 INT. EMILY'S CENTRAL PARK WEST APARTMENT. DAY. 89

EMILY opens the door for LISA. In the b.g. about thirty

people are gathered. A mix of Upper West Siders, social

workers, and Monica's multi-ethnic clients.

Hi. Are you Lisa?

Yeah. Thank you so much for letting me

come.

Why don't you come on in? We're about to

start. Do you want anything to drink?

Oh -- Um -- no thanks.

We have bad hors d'oeuvres and good hors

d'oeuvres.

90 INT. EMILY'S LIVING ROOM. DAY. 90

Everyone is seated on Emily's chairs and borrowed chairs.

Well-thank you all for coming.

Thank you for doing this, Emily.

Yes, thank you, Emily.

As you all know, Monica was not a religious

woman. Anybody who ever had to sit through

a wedding or a funeral with her knows how

she felt about formal occasions. So Harry

and Elise and I, when we were talking about

this, decided we would just have everyone

over and let.anyone who wanted to.talk.

about Monica just talk about her. Maybe

share some remembrances of her. Some of us

know each other, some of us don't. But

we're all here because we loved Monica.

(She stops. Gets a hold of herself) And

because we want to pay tribute to her in a

way that might conceivably not enrage her.

Everyone laughs slightly.

I don't want to tell anyone what to think,

or how to feel. And I don't want to kid

myself about the stupid, meaningless way

she died, because it would really make her

throw up. But I don't want it to become the

summation of her life. Because it's not.

When her Lisa died I said to her, "How can

you stand it?" And she said. "First of all

I can't. But I don't want to take away the

twelve years she did have, and turn them

all into leukemia. Because they weren't."

So despite the fact that she got -- ripped

off, I do think it's important to remember

that Monica got a lot out of life. She was

the most fully developed person I

personally have ever known. She was also

impossible to get along with, but that's

another story.

Everybody laughs.

As most of you know, she had more than her

share of trouble over the years. But that

never diminished her compassion or stopped

her from embracing life to the absolute

fullest -- measure.

She sure did.

So. Now I've said my little piece. And now

I want to talk a little bit about the first

time we met. She was twenty one.

I know...! (She waits) And I was nineteen!

her from across the room.

91 INT. EMILY'S APARTMENT. LATER. DAY. 91

Everyone is milling around. Lisa is talking to Emily.

Emily, thank you so much for letting me be

here.

Don't be silly, honey. You were sweet to

come by.

Didn't she have any family?

No, she was the last one. Except for some

cousins in Arizona. You talked to Abigail.

She's the one who gave you my number...

Yeah...

Well, she's a living nightmare. They never

got along at all.

Excuse me. Good bye, Emily. Thank you so

much for doing this.

Emily and the Woman Mourner hug each other goodbye.

Listen. I still can't believe this is

happening...! (she starts crying) I mean

what the fuck is wrong with her?

I don't know!

I don't understand why she didn't kill

then after all that with her mother, and

then her father, she gets hit by a fucking

bus? It's like a joke! But that's Monica.

Always the worst luck. Always. (noticing

LISA) OK, sweetheart. Thank you for coming.

Please don't stand there staring at me, OK?

(startled, embarrassed)

I'm sorry! I just wanted to say goodbye.

It's OK. Thank you for coming. You're

very sweet.

(to Woman Mourner)

Goodbye.

Goodbye.

As Lisa-goes out she hears:

WOMAN MOURNER (CONT'D)

Who is that?

That's a girl who was passing by at the

time of the accident. She was right-there

when she died, and she wanted to come to

the funeral. I told her there was no

Dials the phone. It rings once. She hangs up.

96 INT. ENGLISH CLASS. DAY. 96

Lisa is very disengaged from the discussion. John is walking

back and forth, reading aloud from King Lear.

"We are to the gods as flies to wanton

boys. They kill us for their sport."

(Pause) We are to the gods as flies to

wanton boys. They kill us for their sport."

What do you make of that? Lisa? Lisa?

I don't know.

Take a stab. What do you think Shakespeare

is saying about human suffering here?

I don't know. Sorry.

You know what, Lisa? That's not good

enough. That's not good enough.

Shakespeare wrote something: What's your

response? And don't tell me you don't have

one because I don't buy it.

I don't really have a lot to say. It seems

pretty self-evident to me.

(Pause. Then:)

Matthew?

I think it is self-evident. I think he's

saying that human beings don't mean any

more to the gods than flies do to little

boys who like to torture them for fun.

Like as far as the gods are concerned we're

just ants. Nothing. (like a newscaster

turning to his colleague) Darren?

The class laughs.

(responding in kind)

Thank you, Matthew. Yeah, I agree. Only

it's not Shakespeare saying it: It's

Gloucester. Maybe another character would

have a different point of view.

OK: That's a valid point. Just because

Shakespeare has one of his characters say

it doesn't mean he personally agrees with

it. Yes: David?

Yeah, maybe Shakespeare isn't saying the

gods don't care about us. Maybe he's saying

there's a higher consciousness that we

can't see. That the gods' perception of

reality is so much more developed than ours

that compared to their perception, our

perceptions are like comparing flies to

OK...I don't think that's what he's getting

at...I think what he's getting at here is a

very dark view of the arbitrary nature of

human suffering.

But maybe he's not. Maybe he's comparing

human consciousness to divine

consciousness, and he's saying that even

though it seems to us that human suffering

is just arbitrary, that's just because

we're limited by our viewpoint.

Well -- let's look at the text. Let's test

David's hypothesis. "We are to the gods as

flies to wanton boys. They kill us for

their sport." I have to agree with Matthew,

that seems pretty unambiguous.

Yeah, because he's saying there's a higher

purpose that we can't see. He's saying that

what seems like them killing us for sport

could just be because our consciousness

isn't developed enough to see what the

higher wisdom of their killing us is.

2nd Blue Revised 10/28/05 - Page 75

OK, but -- I still don't think that's what

he's trying to say. Um...

No, like if you say they kill us for their

sport, when our perception of the gods is

so meager that we can't even tell what

they're doing, then how can we be so

arrogant as to think that they would bother

to kill us for their sport?

I don't know ...Um -- Monica?

I don't think that's what he's saying at

all. I think he's saying the gods don't

give a shit about human beings and they

just kill and torture us for fun --

Yes. Much like flies to wanton boys.

Anybody? Anybody?

Yeah...1

But if the gods' consciousness is so much

more developed than ours that we seem like

flies to them, then how can we be sure what

they have in mind for us or why they do

anything?

David, I think you've made your point.

But it's not what Shakespeare meant.

Scholarly opinion is pretty consistent that

he's trying to say something about

human suffering here --

Scholarly opinion...:

And in this particular play what I think

he's trying to say is pretty black --

pretty bleak --

But what are you saying? A thousand

Frenchmen can't be wrong?

No, I'm not saying that. But I would

like to move on --

I think he is saying that, because he's

comparing human consciousness to flies, and

he's saying that we can't see the truth

around us because our consciousness is

undeveloped.

No David, that's not what Shakespeare

meant! He says it somewhere else in the

play, but I don't want to get hung up on

this any more because it's not what

Shakespeare meant, and I would really like

Lisa is on the phone with Karl. WE CUT BETWEEN THEM.

Hi Dad.

Yeah! Hi! How's everything been going?

OK. How are you?

Not too bad. Pretty good. I'm sitting here

listening to some music. Having a glass of

delicious beer.

That sounds pleasant.

Yeah. Yeah. How are you? How's the

boyfriend situation?

Well...there's this one guy I sort of had

something going with. But he kind of has a

girlfriend, so...

Uh huh?

I realize I'm incredibly enthralling...

You are. You're a beautiful girl. And

you've got brains. That makes you

dangerous.

Don't forget mature.

Well -- I'm hoping you're not too mature.

No...Don't worry.

OK good. That was a good answer,.

Anyway, I do think it's a pretty long-

standing relationship...

OK, then you know what? You do nothing. You

do absolutely nothing. And one of two

things will happen. Either he's gonna start

doing back flips to get your attention, or

you're gonna send him a crystal clear

signal that if he doesn't do back flips

he's not gonna get your attention. OK?

Well, I think he already knows I like him.

Uh huh? OK...

.I think I might have spilled the

beans on that one a little --

That's OK. Because now, if now you stop

acknowledging him, you just suddenly give

him nothing, he's gonna go berserk. Unless

he's just not interested. In which case,

you gotta take your lumps. OK? Which is

tough.

Well, thanks, Dad. I'll be sure to try out

the technique next time I see him.

Yeah. Lemme know what happens.

OK. Well, everything's OK here...A little

Actually, Dad? I definitely want to hear

how things are with you in a minute, but I

actually have something kind of serious I

want to ask you about ...I'm kind of

soliciting people I respect-for their views

on this...

OK. What's up?

. so do you think I should go back to the

police, or what?

OK, well, first of all, I'm very glad you

told me. Second of all, I think you should

let me call my friend who's a lawyer, just

to get some idea of what the ramifications

would be.

You mean to protect myself before I go

back?

There's nothing wrong with knowing what

you're getting into. I'm gonna call my

friend Lorne, I want to see what he says.

ANNETTE, Karl's, girlfriend, 40, lets herself into the house.

Hey...! Actually, Dad? Please

KARL Seriously. I appreciate

Hi babe. your taking charge and

everything, but --

Did you get my message?

Um -- I got a message.

About the flowers? For my mother?

I don't know. Yes. Hold on. (To

walked in.

That's OK.

Who are you talking to?

I'm -- It's -- could I just --

Anyway, I guess I would just like to know

later that I would have done the right

thing by myself, if you see what I mean.

Because I don't think I have so far.

Uh huh?

Who is that? Not that I'm trying to

KARL horrible death into my own

Uh Huh? It's Lisa. personal moral gymnasium...

ANNETTE Shaw.

Good. Will you please ask her

I'm sorry, Lisa. Hold on one

second.

OK.

Yes.

Will you please ask her if there's anything

we don't know about that she won't eat? For

the trip? Because I have to tell the ranch,

because they do all the meals ahead of time

Yes: I will: We're just in the middle of

something.

Karl, I was supposed to call them last

week. You said you were gonna call her and

you didn't. So then I called her, and she

never called me back. So what do you want

me to do?

OK, you know what? I want to talk about

this, not right now.

-- and if there's anything she can't eat

and they put it in the hampers, she's not

gonna have anything to eat. The last time

she came out here we went to three

different places and she couldn't eat

anything on the menu.

I'm going to ask her. I will. We're right

in the middle of something.

OK. Tell her I said hi.

Hello?

101 INT. LISA'S ROOM. NIGHT. 101

102 INT. LISA'S ROOM. NIGHT. LATER. 102

Lisa is asleep. The room is dark. She stirs. She realizes

JOAN is sitting on the edge of her bed, her back to Lisa.

Mom? What's wrong?...Did you have a bad

show? What time is it?.

Joan starts coughing. Blood starts coming out with every

cough, first a little, then a gruesome amount --

LISA WAKES UP -- breathing hard short breaths. The room is

dark and quiet. She calms down and gets up.

Yellow Revised 10/9/05 - Page 81

103 INT. BATHROOM. 103

She comes in without turning on the light. She turns on the

faucet. In the dim bathroom the water looks strangely dark.

She switches on the light --

BLOOD is streaming out the faucet and filling the basin.

She looks up. MONICA the dead woman is standing behind her in

the mirror. Lisa jumps --

104 INT. LISA'S ROOM. 104

Lisa wakes up sharply, breathing hard, drenched in sweat.

104A INT. LISA'S ROOM. DAY. 104A

She dials Maretti's number. It rings...

Hello? (Pause) Hello...?

She hangs up.

105 INTERCUT. SUBWAY (MOVING) DAY. 105

Lisa rides the subway past Brooklyn stations.

106 EXT. BAY RIDGE. DAY. 106

Lisa emerges from the subway station. The Verrazano Narrows

Bridge dominates the background.

107 EXT. MARETTI'S STREET. DAY. 107

Lisa turns the unfamiliar corner. Little kids play in the

street. She checks the address on the piece of paper.

108 EXT. MARETTI'S HOUSE. DAY. 108

She rings the doorbell. Inside she hears kids playing. The

door opens. It's MRS MARETTI, around 35.

Hi, can help you?

Hi. I'm sorry to bother you. My name is

Lisa Cohen. I was involved in the same

accident that Mr Maretti was involved in a

few weeks ago...

Oh my God, were you? Oh my God, what a

thing, huh?

Yeah...I was just wondering if I could talk

to him fora minute. Is he home?

Ummmmm, yeah, sure. Whyn't you come in.

109 INT. MARETTI'S HOUSE. CONTINUOUS. 109

Lisa follows Mrs Maretti into the small apartment. O.C. we

HEAR two small BOYS running around and shouting. MARETTI is

watching TV. Mrs Maretti goes over and speaks to him, low. He

sees LISA and slowly gets up.

Hi. I'm really sorry to bother you...We

never met. My name is Lisa Cohen...

Yeah...What can I do for you?

Well...do you remember me? From the bus

accident?

I don't know.. .What' s this about?

Well, would it be OK if I talked to you for

a minute?

What do you want to talk about? I don't

understand.

I'd just like to talk about the accident

for a minute. I don't want anything, and

I'm not here to do anything bad. I just

wanted to talk to you about it.

How did you get my address?

It's in the phone book. I was gonna call

first...

Well, it woulda been better if you woulda

called. We're about to sit down...

Mrs Maretti has drifted back toward them.

Yellow Revised 10/9/05 - Page 83

I don't get what, uh...Yeah all right.

Let's go outside.

I'm sorry: Could I use your bathroom?

No, let's just go outside.

Oh Gerry, let her use the bathroom.

No, I don't want her to use the bathroom.

I don't understand what this is.

It's right over there, honey. (turning)

Will you kids settle down, please! I'm not

kiddin'!

Lisa goes in the bathroom.

MARETTI MRS MARETTI

What's the matter with you? Who is she?

MARETTI MRS MARETTI

She's some girl who was at the Nothin's the matter with me,

accident -- let her use the fuckin'

bathroom.

110 INT. BATHROOM. DAY. 110

Lisa latches the door of the cluttered little bathroom. She

sits on the toilet and tries to pee. After a minute a tiny

amount of pee comes out.

111 -INT. THE LIVING ROOM -- A MOMENT LATER. 111

Lisa comes out. The Marettis are waiting for her as before.

O.C., we hear the boys yelling at each other.

112 EXT. MARETTI'S HOUSE. DAY. 112

Maretti, Mrs Maretti, and Lisa come out.

(to MRS MARETTI)

Honey, just do me a favor, wait inside.

No. I wanna hear what this is.

Well ...If it's OK, I'd rather talk to Mr

Maretti in private.

No it's not OK.

OK. We're just tryin' to...OK: What?

Lisa looks at them, wishing Mrs Maretti would leave.

OK. I hope this isn't going to insult you

too much...

Insult me...?

.I was just wondering if you felt bad at

all about what happened.

Do I feel bad about the accident?

Yeah.

You know, honey? Are you just upset about

the accident...?

Yes! I'm upset about the accident! I'm very

upset about the accident! I was covered in

blood! I've never been covered in blood

before, and I wanted to talk to you about

it for a minute! Why is that so strange!?

Gerry... why don't we all go inside and sit

down?

Could I please talk to you alone?

MRS MARETTI.

OK, what is goin' on here?

Nothin's goin' on here. So whyn't you calm

down? Look: Go ahead inside. Let me find

out what this is. Meantime whyn't you make

sure those kids aren't killin' each other,

all right?

All right.

Yellow Revised 10/9/05 - Page 84A

As Mrs Maretti goes inside:

No, you know what? Let 'em kill each other.

Give us all a rest. (To LISA) All right,

Lisa. What.

I just...Well, I just want you to know...

Yes? What? Speak!

Well... you probably already know,

obviously, that I told-the police on the

police report that I thought the whole,

thing was an accident...

Uh huh. Right. Because it was an accident.

Well -- I mean, I know you didn't do it on

purpose.

On purpose...?

But it wasn't like...

What. (Pause) Speak. Talk! What!

Well ...I mean ...We were looking at each

other...

Who was looking at each other...? You and

me?

Well ...Yeah ...I mean. . .not like...

romantically or anything...

Romantically...!

OK, scratch that. 'Cause that's not

even... relevant...

You're not comin' through very clearly!

OK. I can see the way this is.

The way what is? What! Speak to me! What?

I am --

Don't drag me outta my house on a Saturday

afternoon and then make me stand here

pullin' teeth to find out what you're

talkin' about.

Yellow Revised 10/9/05 - Page 86

What! What!

All right! Well...the way I remember the

accident is that you were wearing this

cowboy hat --

Yes, it's my cowboy hat that I wear

sometimes to amuse myself on the bus, yes.

I was probably wearing my cowboy hat, yes.

What.

If you could just let me...! From my point

of view, I was out that day trying to buy a

cowboy hat, so I was waving at you, becase

I was looking for one... and you were kind

of waving back...And I know the police

already decided it was No Fault, or No

Criminality or whatever they call it --

No Criminality, that's right.

-- I guess partly because of what I told

them. And I know I was distracting you,

but -- I did see the bus go through the red

light. And that's when it hit that woman.

OK. I'm gettin' a little confused over

here.

Only nobody said that to them. And I just

wanted to like, acknowledge with you that

that's what happened.

OK. First of all, I don't really know what

you mean by wavin' at you...What were you,

tryin' to catch the bus...?

No...Yes. But I wanted to ask about your --

Maybe I was wavin' at you like, wavin' to

say, you know, "Step away from the bus,"

if the bus was in motion, I would've waved

you away for your-own safety, but that's

all that would be.

Yellow Revised 10/9/05 - Page 87

You don't remember looking at me and waving

at me?

Mrs. Maretti comes out again.

No. Not really. No.

Well ...I think we both remember something

different.

Your brother's on the phone.

Tell him I'll call him back.

Mrs Maretti goes back inside.

I'm not trying to get you in trouble.

I know you're not, because you couldn't get

me in trouble. Uhhhh, there's no

criminality found...the report is, uh,

final. And that's it.

So you're just gonna leave it?

I'm gonna leave it, because that's all that

it was. If something else would have

happened, I'd take it to whatever that was.

It was tragic, it was a tragedy. But

there's only a certain speed the brakes can

react. That's a physical limitation of the

machine. I don't know what else to tell

you. It was a shock. It's shock. But

that's it. Can't bring her back. Cannot

bring her back.

I'm not talking about bringing her back.

.I'm talking about telling the accident

investigators what really happened.

But you already talked to them!

I know that. But I lied.

You lied.

Yes. And I can understand if you don't want

to get in trouble, but.--

Then how come nobody else saw it?

I can't help what other people saw --

You would think somebody else would see it.

I just know what I saw!

Then why didn't you say something right

then?

Because -- when they were asking me what

happened -- it seemed like you were kind of

looking at me -- like we were saying to

each other, "Let's not say anything about

what happened."

Oh, now I really don't know what you're

talkin' about.

I can't prove that you were doing that --

Mrs Maretti comes back outside.

What did I say anything to you? Did I

threaten you?

No! And I am not blaming you for any of

this! All I'm saying is that I didn't

really tell the cops what happened, and I

didn't want to go back without --

But you told 'em what you saw! You told 'em

what you saw! And so did I! Only I'm the

one behind the wheel!

Yellow Revised 10/9/05 - Page 89

Gerry! Take it easy!

(To MRS MARETTI)

No, it's all right. Leave it alone. (To

LISA) You wanna ruin my life, start tellin'

'em about looks, and you waved at me and I

had on my cowboy hat, go ahead! You're

gonna go back to school and do your

homework and I'm gonna lose my job! And

who's gonna feed my kids? You? Are you

gonna do it? And for what! She's dead!

She's dead! And there's nothin' I-can do to

bring her back!

I just want to say what really happened.

Hey do whatever you fuckin' want.

Gerry -- !

But those cops are gonna laugh in your

fuckin' face because this was not my fault!

It was both our fault.

What'd you say?

It was both our fault.

Maretti scrambles in his pocket for a pen.

Yeah. Don't say that to me.again without a

lawyer. Gimme your phone number.

What's your number? Gimme LISA

your number. Oh, you wanna Mjy? No! Why do you want it?

come to my house like some

anonymous person, I can't

get in touch with you? MRS MARETTI

What's your fuckin' number, Gerry! Take it easy!

Lisa Cohen!

Fine! It's -- um -- 212- 555 --

Hold on. (writes) 555 --

0157. Why do you need it?

Do whatever you're gonna do. I hope you got

a good lawyer.

I don't know why you're --

Maretti turns and goes in the house.

You know this was very traumatic for him!

It's almost as bad as getting your deg cut

Does your mother know you're here?

Yes.

112A INT. SUBWAY (MOVING) DAY. 112A

CU on Lisa as she rides back toward Manhattan.

113 INT. EMILY'S KITCHEN. DAY. 113

Emily sits with Lisa at the kitchen table.

Why didn't you say anything before?

I guess I was afraid. I didn't know what to

do.a

You didn't know what to do? The woman is

killed right in front of you and you didn't

know what to do?

I know it doesn't sound very impressive.

Impressive! (Pause) All right: I know

you're trying to do the right thing now.

What does your mother say?

My mother hasn't really been that helpful.

What do you mean?

I mean she's got a lot going on right now

and she just hasn't been that interested, I

guess.

What could she possibly have going on?

Her show is opening.

What do you mean, her show? What show?

She's in a play.

My friend is dead because some guy was

looking at your ass and you lied to the

police about it, and your mother can't be

bothered because she's in a play?

Well, it's kind of a big deal for her.

She has a really big part.

I'm sorry. I don't know your mother, but,

that is pretty shocking.

I guess she's really worried about getting

a bad review or something.

OK. I'm gonna talk to my friend who's a

lawyer, and I'm gonna call Monica's cousin -

you talked to her -- And you're gonna go

talk to the police. Do you want me'to-go

with you?

No thanks.

Do you think maybe you should ask your

mother to go with you?

I think I can handle this part myself.

Oh, I am so angry. I am so angry.

113A TIME PERMITTING.

114 INT. THEATER -- BACKSTAGE/ONSTAGE. NIGHT.

Joan waits in the wings. Her CUE LIGHT goes ON and OFF.

TRACKING her onstage as she enters.

Hey! Let me tell you something, Eliot --

She is interrupted by entrance APPLAUSE.

You want to fire me, go ahead and fire me.

Only don't tiptoe around me like.some-kind

of deranged ballerina every time I see you

in the fucking hall! Now: Do you have

anything to say to me, Eliot?

Um -- you're not fired...?

This gets a pretty big laugh from the audience.

Oh. (Abashed, friendly) What are you guys

talking about?

Another big laugh.

She's good, eh?

115 INT. COHEN APARTMENT -- LIVING ROOM. MORNING. 115

you understand that? If they wrote mean

things about you in the newspaper you

wouldn't like it. Even if you didn't agree

with it, or base your self-esteem on it.

Why can't you understand that?

I do understand it, because we have this

conversation every time! You're great in

the play, you're a great actress, everybody

thinks you're great, everything about you

is great, you're really really pretty --

Oh shut up.

So let me just find the review and then we

can both kill ourselves, OK?

Fine.

Lisa finds The New York Times review online.

Did you find it?

Yes.

Is it bad?

Let me read it. (she reads) OK, it's really

good.

It is?

Oh my God. Listen to this:

Don't read it to me.

".. .but it is the frankly extraordinary

Joan Kaplan who transforms the savage wit

of David Holmes' acid comedy-drama into

something approaching sheer luminosity..."

Get out.

"But don't be misled by her feather-light

touch and expert comic timing. With the

canny (Has trouble enunciating:) bray...

Bravura?

Yes. "-- of an actor at the JOAN

Top of Craft, Ms. Kaplan takes Top of Craft...?

us on an emotional roller

coaster that is both hilarious

and heartbreaking, maddening

and magical."

Shut up!

OK. This is the best review I've ever read.

Just for me, or for everyone?

115 CONTINUED:. (2) 115

No, he likes the play, he likes the cast,

but the main thrust of it is basically what

a genius you are, and how your time has

come.

Fuck him, what does he know? (A la Noel

Coward) Maddening and magical, eh? If only

I knew what that meant.

Oh my God you're a huge star.

Oh my God!

Can I make coffee now?

Yes. Thank you honey.

Lisa heads for the kitchen as the PHONE RINGS.

Here come the offers.

(Picks up the phone)

115A INT. COHEN APARTMENT - KITCHEN. DAY. 115A

her jacket -- speak to me that way:

You know I'm Top of Craft.

Lisa closes the door or turns up the radio.

116 INT. ENGLISH CLASS. DAY. 116

John is reading from a paperback poetry anthology. On the

blackboard it says "19TH CENTURY POETS -- GERARD MANLEY

HOPKINS -- 1844-1889." SLOW PUSH IN on Lisa.

Spring and Fall to a young girl

by Gerard Manley Hopkins.

"Margaret are you grieving

Over Goldengrove unleaving?

Leaves, like the things of man, you

With your fresh thoughts care for, can you?

Ahl as the heart grows older

It will come to such thoughts colder

By and by, nor spare a sigh

Though worlds of wanwood leafmeal lie,

And yet you will weep, and know why.

Now no matter, child, the name:

Sorrow springs are the same.

Nor mouth had, no nor mind, expressed

What heart heard of, ghost guessed:

It is the blight man was born for,

It is Margaret you mourn for."

Silence.

Any thoughts? Lisa?

Lisa looks up slowly.

117 OMITTED. 117

118 EXT. HIGHWAY ONE POLICE STATION - THE BRONX. DAY. 118

Lisa gets out a taxi in front of the station.

119 INT. HIGHWAY ONE POLICE STATION. DAY. 119

Lisa walks up to the desk of a 2ND A.I.S.DETECTIVE.

2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE

Could I help you?

Um, yeah. Is Detective Mitchell here?

2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE

No he's not.

Oh. Um -- I talked to him on Monday and he

said he'd be here after three...

2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE

Yeah, he's not back yet. Could I help you

with something?

Um, well, do you know when do you expect

him?

2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE

What's this about?

I was involved in an accident a few weeks

2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE

Uh huh?

And I filled out a report with Detective

Mitchell, but wanted to amend the report,

so I thought I should --

2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE

What do you mean amend the report? How do

you want to amend it?

Well, there was something I didn't tell

him, and I wanted to tell him, because --

2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE

So wait, I don't understand. You wanna

change your statement?

Yes! Yes! I want to change my statement.

(Pause. Calmer) Yes.

2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE

Well, you'd usually have to talk to the

investigating detective on the case...

Yes. I know. That's why I asked to see

Detective Mitchell. Who said he'd be here

now. Which he's not. So...

2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE

You remember the case number?

No. Sorry. It was that woman Monica

Patterson, who got run over by the bus, on

Broadway -- it was in a lot of the

newspapers...

2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE

OK, yeah, sure OK. Sit down, sit down.

Thank you. I ---

2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE

You know the case is closed.

I assume it was. But part of the reason

it's closed is because of my statement.

And the statement I gave --

2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE

Because of your statement?

Another male detective walks by, behind LISA. The two men

exchange a glance referring to Lisa being a cute girl.

Yes.

2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE

What do you mean it was closed because of

your statement?

I mean --

2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE

The DA's office closes the case. You don't

close the case. The DA's office closes the

case.

I'm sure it does. I obviously didn't mean

I personally closed the case, like,

legally. I meant that what I said was

probably instrumental in getting the case

closed, because I was the --

2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE

What's your name, honey?

Lisa Cohen.

2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE

Don't call me honey, OK?

Pause.

2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE

OK.

Are you not gonna help me now that I said

that?

2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE

Look -- what's your name?

Lisa Cohen!

2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE

OK Lisa, first thing, you're gonna calm

I'm calm right now!

2ND A.I.S. DETECTIVE

OK. Just checking. Second thing -- Oh!

Here he is: Your knight in shining armor.

MITCHELL has just come in. LISA gets up.

This guy been givin' you a hard time?

No...

What's this guy been sayin' to you?

Nothing. I don't know if you remember

me... I'm Lisa Cohen. I called you on

Monday?

Sure I do. What's up?

120 INT. HIGHWAY ONE POLICE STATION - MITCHELL'S DESK - LATER 120

Lisa sits across from Mitchell.

So now you're sayin' he ran the light.

Yes. He wasn't even looking at the road.

And I was definitely trying to get his

attention...

No, I get the picture. So you're flirtin'

with this guy, he's wavin' at you, he runs

the light, hits the decedent, she dies on

the scene...the both of youse lie to me on

both of your statements, and then

somewheres in there you turn around, decide

the guy belongs in jail. That right? That

about right?

I don't have any control over if he goes to

jail or not. I certainly have my hopes. I

just want to set the record straight, so

that if he gets away with this I won't have

been a part of it.

And what do you think I should do with you?

Just gimmeaa clue. 'cause I'm just a little

bit lost over here...:

Do whatever you want. I know what I did.

OK. Well. Before we do anything, Lisa,

anybody will tell you that just because he

ran a red light is not a criminal offence.

Even if he kills someone?

Even if you cause an accidental death,

that's right. For this to be a criminal

offense, the law says you need two

aggravating circumstances. Like he ran a red

light and he was speeding. Or he ran a red

light and he was --

(On 2nd "red")

So he's not liable to be prosecuted for

manslaughter? Or second degree murder?

No. He could be charged with reckless

driving, and fillip' out a false police

report. Which, that's no joke --

That's unbelievable! What does he have to

do? Kill her on purpose?

Yes. Because that's the definition of

murder. Killin' somebody on purpose.

You're not sayin' he ran her over on

purpose, are you?

Pause.

No.

Pause.

All, right, look. Lemme take another

statement, and, uh...We'11 look into it,

OK?

You're kidding.

No. I'll go over it with my sergeant,

probably pull this guy in again.

Reinterview him. Put a little pressure on

him. See what he says.

Thank you...! Thank you.

120A INT. SCHOOL - GYMNASIUM. DAY. 12 OA

She stretches. Lisa notices the boys looking at Bonnie.

121 EXT. CENTRAL PARK. DAY. 121

Lisa and Becky are smoking pot on a rock or bench.

(holding in smoke)

.Yeah, because the Central Park

Conservatory or whatever it's called put up

about five hundred miles worth of these

cheap shitty-looking fences all over the

park. Which is totally antithetical to

what the park was originally designed for.

She exhales and hands Becky the joint.

We are totally gonna miss the game. Oh my

God it's John...! It's John!

They try to hide the joint from JOHN, the English teacher,

who approaches them and stops. Pause.

Hi John.

Hi John. (Pause) Want some?

They giggle.

Come on, guys. You can't be smokin' a j.

on your way to a school soccer game! Now

come on!

Sorry.

We're really sorry.

John glares at them, then turns and walks away.

OK: How about how he's like, "Smokin' a j."

Like, "You can't be smokin' a j."

They all burst out laughing.

CU on the angry embarrassed back of John's reddening grown-up

neck as he keeps walking away.

122 EXT. CENTRAL PARK -- WEST OF THE GREAT LAWN. DAY. 122

Lisa walks through the park, somewhat stoned, enjoying the

sunshine. She sees MR AARON approaching on a bike. He bikes

up to her and stops.

Hi, Mr Aaron...!

How are you, Lisa?

I'm pretty damn good. How are you?

I'm all right, I'm all right-Tell me

something. Whatever happened with that

situation?

Oh...aI'm working on it. I'll tell you all

about it sometime...(squinting at him in

the sunshine) Hey, what kind of a bike is

that?

Um, a Trek.

I'm supposed to take a horseback riding

trip with my father over Christmas break

and I was just wondering, does it bear any

resemblance to riding a bicycle?

As far as I know, no, it doesn't, no...

But you must have ridden a lot of horses.

What makes you say so?

Aren't you from Texas or Wyoming or

someplace like that?

Someplace like what?

You know: Not New York.

I'm actually from Indiana. But don't let me

overwhelm you with superfluous details.

God, so what are you doing at a New York

private school teaching geometry to a bunch

of overprivileged liberal Jews?

Is that a real question, or a Lisa

question?

What's a Lisa question?

A question designed to prolong the

conversation without there being any

particular interest in the actual

answer...?

About half and half.

In that case --

Before you go, I am actually thinking of

getting one of these. Can I try it? Just

for one second?

All right.

Thanks.

Aaron gets off the bike. She climbs on. The seat is too high

for her.

You want me to adjust the seat?

No thanks. This actually feels really,

really good. God, I'm kidding! You are so

easy to tease!

She bikes away awkwardly, turns around and bikes back toward

him, wobbling badly.

I like your bicycle...! Can I have it?

No!

She tries to stop in front of him but skids and he catches

her hard by the arms to stop her.

MR AARON (CONT'D)

OK. Off.

Can I just ask you how is it possible that

I am totally in love with you and you have

almost no interest in me whatsoever? It's

not like I'd ever say anything if you ever

deigned to like, you know, be with me.

Lisa...!

I can tell you like me. It's not like I'm a

virgin, if that's what you're worried

about. I'm not even close.

I can't even be having this conversation

with you.

Yeah, you keep saying that, but I notice

you're still standing here.

You're absolutely right. Goodbye.

He gets on the bike.

It's not my fault if I revere you as a god!

He laughs or smiles briefly in spite of himself.

Oh my God. I made you laugh. I am so happy

right now.

I'll see you in class.

We pull away with him as she watches him go.

123 INT. COHEN APARTMENT - FRONT HALL. NIGHT. 123

Lisa walks in as Joan is putting on her coat.

Hi. Where have you been? I didn't know.if

you wanted dinner.

Oh -- no thanks. I'll order something.

Someone named Emily called. And Detective

Mitchell called from the Accident

Investigation Squad. Is that the one you

talked to?

Yeah, did he say anything?

Just to call him back. What's going on? Did

you ever go back and see him?

I'd rather not talk about it when you have

one foot out the door. I'll tell you later,

if that's OK.

Of course it is. Who's Emily?

She's the friend of the woman who died, the

one who had the funeral...

Oh yeah, OK. Well, her number's by the

phone.

OK. How's Ramon?

Oh God. I don't know. I mean I really like

him. He's really nice.

But I'm not sure he actually ever

understands a word I say.

Give him a chance, Mom, you just met-the

guy.

But don't you know what I mean? I just feel

kind of lonely when I'm with him. You know?

You feel lonely when you're with him?

Yeah. You never felt that way when you were

with someone?

I guess so. I feel that way all the time.

You get used to it.

Well ...I don't know how serious I want to

get with somebody who makes me feel that

way.

So don't get serious. That's my advice.

Pause.

All right. I'm gonna go.

Have a good show.

124 INTERCUT -- LIVING ROOM. SIMULTANEOUS 124

Curtis, busy with his computer, doesn't answer.

BACK IN THE FRONT HALL -- Joan shrugs it off.

'Bye sweetie.

125 INT. BUILDING HALLWAY. NIGHT. 125

She hits the elevator button. Sees her reflection in the

little round elevator window. She looks old to herself, and

haggard. She touches under her chin.

107

126 INT. ELEVATOR. CONTINUOUS. 126

Joan gets in. The door shuts. She leans her head against the

wall and bursts into tears., The elevator stops with a DING.

She wipes her eyes quickly. A woman NEIGHBOR comes in.

Hello...!

Hello.

Congratulations on the show...!

Thank you.

That was such a wonderful review...! And

I read somewhere it might be going to

Broadway?

Supposedly. In March.

God! Exciting...!

Yeah, it's going well. Knock wood.

127 INT. COLUMBUS AVENUE RESTAURANT. DAY. 127

Lisa, Emily and DAVE, a good natured intelligent 35ish

lawyer, are at a window table.

Lisa, Dave is one of my best friends.

He's a terrific lawyer and if he doesn't

know what to do himself he'll certainly

know someone we can talk to.

OK, great.

So Dave, just tell Lisa everything you told

me, if you don't mind repeating

Not at all. I love to repeat myself.

Are you guys gonna order something?

108

128 INT. COLUMBUS AVENUE RESTAURANT. DAY. LATER. 128

They are drinking coffee. Lisa smokes.

When someone is killed it's what you call a

Wrongful Death Suit, which is a statutory

case, which just means there's a statute

passed by the legislature which gives you

the right to bring the case.

As opposed to what?

As opposed to common law, which is law made

by judges. Which is why the damages are

limited.

I don't understand.

Look, just skip that part. We don't care

about that.

I thought we were trying to get the

police to arrest this guy...!

No -- the police are not, uh --

Why not? They told me they Dave doesn't think the

were gonna look into it police are gonna --

again.

I'm just telling you that even if they do,

there is no way in this world they are

gonna recommend to the DA that they charge

this guy. That's why --

So what can we do?

Well. I'm --

Sorry.

That's OK -- That's OK, honey...

I am the executor of her estate.

-- which is Emily. I know.

So good.

Yes. This is good. Because the executor of

the estate Cdn bring a Wrongful Death suit,

but the beneficiary has to be a relative.

So let me explain about that. In a Wrongful

Death suit you can sue for Pain and

Suffering, Pecuniary Losses, Lose of

Support or Services.. .And also what's

called Care, Comfort and Society: --like

advice, counseling of the parent that the

kids aren't gonna get anymore...

You can really sue for that?

Yeah, and that's probably what we would do,

So -- I don't understand. Who are we suing?

The bus driver?

Well, no, because the bus driver wouldn't

have any money. You basically sue everybody

and hope something sticks. The person who

pays will be the MTA's insurance company.

But do you think the driver would get

fired?

No. Not necessarily.

Even if all the facts came out at the

trial?

Maybe. I don't know.

But how much could they be liable for?

It depends: How badly do you think we

could ever hurt them?

-- if she was alive, in great pain for an

extended period of time, they give more

money for that.

I'd say she was alive for ten minutes.

And I gather in a lot .of pain?

Her leg was cut off.

Yes -- obviously. And -- but was she

conscious? Awake, the whole time?

I'm sorry, Emily. (To DAVE) Yeah, awake.

That's OK.

Well, if she was in a lot of pain for that

long ...I don't know. . .maybe 300,000 or a

half a million dollars to get a sustainable

verdict? A brain damaged baby would bea

three million. But the truth is, Lisa,

after all's said and done, it's not a very

good case.

Why not?

Because it's your word against his, and

because you already lied on your first

deposition. A red light case is a fifty-

fifty proposition already. And with only

one eyewitness, with two conflicting

statements? I wouldn't take-that case.

Nobody really cares about getting a lot of

money here.

I understand that --

We just want this prick to Buffer. and we

want the bus company to take resonsibility

for hiring this guy.

I understand. But no matter how you slice

it, the fact that Lisa lied on her first

statement is a disaster for your lawyer.

Can't I explain why I lied the first time?

It's not like I'm trying to get any money

for myself.

That's true-Since she have no financial

interest she can't be impeached for bias.

Impeached for what?

She can't have her credibility attacked on

financial grounds because the jury knows

you're not getting any money if you win.

So that's'something, isn't it?

But do you really think we know what that

means?

I'm sorry. That's what its called.

But who are you talking to? You know we

don't know what that means. It's like

you're not really concentrating.

I -- don't know. I am concentrating. I'm

just thinking out loud.

OX. All right. I'm sorry...I

He wasn't always a lawyer you know. He

used to be a very nice little boy.

Anyway.. the only thing I could think of is

it i@ the MTA. So they're not gonna want a

lot of publicity.

Anyway, the whole point is to get this guy --

Is to fucking get this guyl

No, its to get him out from behind the

wheel of a bus!

Did she know she was dying? I only ask

because the terror of knowing you're dying

raises the damages.

I think she had a pretty good idea.

If she had lived for a couple of days it

would make the case better...I know this

sounds horrible, but this is what it comes

down to...

I know. We know, Dave. That's OK.

Silence. Emily starts to speak:

I actually did have one more thought...I do

know one guy who's, uh... You know what? Yo

know what I want to do7 I want to make a

few phone calls, and then, just let me get

back to you.

I would just like somebody to take

responsibility for what happened.

(On hold) Fuck you...

Pink Revised 9/25/05 - Page 112A

130 INT. SQUAD ROOM. DAY. 130

Mitchell picks up the phone. WE CUT BETWEEN THEM.

Detective Mitchell.

Oh, hi, it's Lisa Cohen calling.

Hi Lisa, what can I do for you?

Well, I was just wondering what ever

happened, if anything, with the case.

You said you might re-interview the bus

driver...

Yes, we did:.We brought him back in --

You did? What happened?

Well, he basically stuck to his original

representation, and that was pretty much

it. I brought it up with my sergeant, but

he agrees with me we still don't have

enough to charge this guy, so there's

really not a lot more we can do at this

point.

But how did you ask the questions?

Excuse me?

He's obviously not gonna change his

statement if you just ask him like really

politely: Why would he? We already know

he's a liar.

Hey, you know, Lisa, in the old days we'd

just throw him in the back with a rubber

hose and we'd get whatever answer we want

out of him. But fortunately we don't do

that kind of thing anymore --

Yeah, not to white people.

Excuse me?

You don't do it to white people. Anyway,

I'm not saying you --

We don't do it to who?

Oh my God...

First of all, I don't know why you're

bringin' the guy's race into it. There's

forty thousand cops in this city --

Yes, thank you, yes.

-- and I hate to disillusion you, but most

of 'em are pretty good guys, just tryin' to

do their job. Bottom line is the DA's not

gonna take this case. (Pause) Now you could

talk to my sergeant if you want to, but --

Yes, I would.

131 INT. COHEN HALLWAY/KITCHEN. DUSK. 131

Joan, dressed to go to work, drops her keys in her purse as

she comes down the hall and lingers in the kitchen doorway to

find LISA on the phone, listening, then:

So there's no way to appeal --

SERGEANT V.O.

(over the phone, flat)

There's nothin' to appeal. There's no case.

But how do you know Detective Mitchell

interrogated him aggressively enough if you

weren't there?

What's going on?

LISA waves her away.

132 EXT. RAMON'S TERRACE. NIGHT. 132

Joan and Ramon are having drinks and looking at his great

view of the Upper West Side. Joan is smoking.

-- so funny: it's the same show, but now

they all read how great it is, we get these

big standing ovations every night, and it's

the exact same show as before.

But why do you put yourself down? It's a

wonderful show and a wonderful performance.

No, it's not -- I'm not putting myself

down. It's just that the audience always

reacts differently if they've been told

it's good. A lot of actors have that

experience.

Mm hm?

She takes a few steps away.

I love this view...(Pause) You know,

Ramon...this may sound very stupid to you,

but do you ever worry that we don't have

very much in common?

What do you mean?

Well, I don't mean to sound dissatisfied,

or disgruntled. But I feel like we're

always misunderstanding each other. Do you

feel that way at all? Or am I just

completely off the beam?

I don't think we should talk about that,

Joan.

You don't? Well...I think it's kind of

important or I wouldn't have brought it up.

Joan... I like you very much. But let's not

talk about what you are like, and what I am

like. That never makes a good result. Talk

about it with your friends.

My friends...!

Yes.

He sips his drink. Joan doesn't know what to say. Pause.

May I show you some pictures of my boys?

Sure. Just don't tell me what they're like.

132A INT. RAMON'S LIVING ROOM. NIGHT. 132A

Ramon and Joan are in his modernistic, scrupulously clean

carpeted living room, on the sofa, looking at pictures.

That's a little place we used to go on

holiday, two hours outside of

Cartagena...My family is all there still,

but Rodrigo is studying in London, and

Hector is in Geneva.

Uh huh...

I'm sure they will go back eventually,

because they like to do something for their

country. But it's a worry, because it's

very bad there now.

Yeah...I haven't really been following it.

It's a big, big mess. Last year I helped to

found an organization to work with children

whose families have been killed, or the

parents have been kidnapped, so they don't

know if they are alive or dead. We try to

find homes for them, preferably in

Colombia, because if we lose our young

people, that's it: That's the future. We

have raised a lot of money, but there's

only so much we can do. You don't like to

say it's hopeless, but it's hard to see the

solution.

Yeah. God...I wish I knew more about

it...Do you mind if I ask you something?

Of course not.

Why are you interested in me?

132A CONTINUED: 132A

You don't think I should be?

I just feel kind of ignorant about your

whole world...

You think it would be better if we knew

about all the same things?

Not really, not exclusively. It's just

unusual. Don't you think it's unusual?

132A CONTINUED: (2) 132A

Not for me.

I guess you travel a lot. I've only been

out of the country a few times in my whole

life.

You should travel more.

I know. I've always wanted to. It's hard

when you're in the theater...

Still, you should try. It's a big world.

You're an artist. You should see more of

it.

I know. You don't have to keep saying that.

I've always wanted to travel. It's just a

little difficult with two kids and no

husband, but it's hard to make a lot of

money in the theater. I was on a TV show a

few years back and I socked away some money

because of that, but my ex-husband --

Karl.

Karl, yes, you remembered, very good.

Karl's very generous with the kids when he

can be, but he's struggling too: He's a

director: he directs commercials, and now

he's trying to produce them... Anyway, I'm

not ignorant because I enjoy it.

I don't say you're ignorant... Do you think

Lisa will be interested in acting?

I don't think so. I think's she's got a

lot of contempt for it. Of course that may

be the age.

She would prefer the world with no plays?

No films?

Oh... Who knows.

132A CONTINUED: (3) 132A

Would you like to see a picture of my

mother?

Sure.

These are all my aunts and uncles...See?

Big family...

Mmm.

She looks at him as he turns the pages.

133 EXT. MIDTOWN OFFICE BUILDING. DAY. 133

Lisa and Emily meet in front of Dave's office building.

134 INT. DAVE'S LAW FIRM - STAIRCASE/OFFICE. DAY. 134

Dave walks Lisa and Emily into his office.

So after I talked to you guys I called

this P.I. I know and I asked him to --

You called a what? A what?

Private Investigator -- to see if he could

find anything out about your bus driver --

Really?

Yeah: So he -- Dave!

Wait, let me tell you what he said! So he

called this guy he knows who used to be a

cop for the MTA. Did you know the MTA have

their own police? The MTA police? They have

their own uniforms...

Yeah? Yeah? Yeah?

And -- Just a minutel Jesus Christ! What do we

police and their uniforms?!

-- so this guy got someone to let him

sneak a look at your guy's file. And it

turns out he's had two previous accidents --

less than two years apart -- one of them on

the job, one in his own car --

What?

-- where there was some allegation that he

was drinking, which was dropped, but, that

he's never been cited or disciplined, just

moved around to different shifts --

Are you fucking kidding me?

Why does this not shock me?

Because Surprise Surprise his brother-in-

law is a very big muckety-muck in the

Transit Workers Union --

(i.e., "I get it.")

O-Kay...l

And if you read the paper, you'll know

they're going through a protracted labor

dispute at the MTA right now, and according

to my PI, the management doesn't want to

aggravate the situation by firing this guy.

Especially since the police have concluded

he was not at fault.

This is making me sick.

I know, but what it means, Lisa, is that we

have a case.

We do?

What it means, in fact, is that we have a

very good case, because we can sue for

what's called "Negligent Retention." Which

means they should have known the guy was a

bad risk and was irresponsible and they

negligently retained him until he finally

killed somebody.

And you can prove that?

Sure, because we can subpoena their

Personnel records, which we already know

contain damaging information, because my

investigator got a look at them beforehand.

Which you're not-supposed to do, but we did

it anyway.

And that means...

That means we're in great shape and I think

we should go in there and sue their fuckin'

asses off.

But you wouldn't be our lawyer, right?

No no. Oh no.

Why not?

I'm not a personal injury It's not his area.

litigator. I don't know

enough about it. I would

lose.

But you could recommend someone?

Sure. I know a guy who's very good. His

name is Russel Deutsch. He's not a

sleazebag. Very experienced. Let me give

you his number...

Dave, thank you so much.

Really. My God.

But you gotta get that crazy cousin on

board because she's gonna be your

beneficiary.

She's not gonna want to come to New York, I

can tell you that right now.

If you win she gets anywhere from three to

five hundred thousand dollars. She's gonna

come to New York.

135 EXT. MIDTOWN -- 6TH AVENUE. DAY. 135

Lisa and Emily walk up the busy avenue.

What's with Monica and her cousin?

Oh, Monica's father left some money to

Abigail's kids and he made Monica the

executor of the estate, because he didn't

want Abigail and her idiot husband to get

their hands on the money before the kids

were grown up.

For which Abigail rewarded her by badgering

her about it on the phone for fifteen

years: Always trying to borrow money

against the estate, accusing her of making

lousy investments with it, nasty phone

calls, nasty letters, every month for

fifteen years until Abigail's daughter

turned twenty-one and got married. Then

Monica goes to the wedding, in fucking

Arizona, and Abigail literally won't speak

to her. She's a dream.

So that's who we're getting the money for?

It's not who we're getting it for, it's who

we're getting it from.

136 INT. DEUTSCH'S OFFICE. DAY. 136

is slightly smaller and less nice than Dave's.

First thing we do is we file a summons and

a complaint against the MTA. They get

.twenty days to respond, and when they do we

can make our Discovery requests: Accident

reports, personnel records, et cetera. But

you gotta realize it's gonna take some

time. The law says you have to get a court

date within a year. Usually it takes about

six. Depending.

Six years!

Depending, yes.

Now, I mentioned to Dave I have a friend

who writes for the Metro section of the

Times...

Yes: Now this, if it could really happen,

this changes everything in our favor. If

they think there's gonna be adverse

publicity, especially in The New York

Times, they're gonna want to settle right

away, soon as possible, and as quietly as

So they'd.make it a condition that

It's usually done, you get the money but

you can't talk about it. Nobody knows the

terms.

So what good does that do?

You get the money. (Pause) is that bad?

(Pause) I thought that's what we're all

here for. (Pause) This is how our society

punishes people for doing bad things.

By getting money from their employers'

insurance. companies?

Yes. It's called Punitive Damages.

Pause.

Could we insist they fire the driver? As

part of the settlement?

Yes, sure, why not?

But is that something people do?

Sure. It's one of your conditions.

Great.

And you think we're gonna win? They're

gonna settle?

Emily and Lisa take hands and squeeze.

137 INT. COHEN APARTMENT -- LIVING ROOM. LATER THAT DAY. 137

I want to talk to you.

What'd I do now?

138 INT. EMILY'S APARTMENT -- FRONT DOOR. DAY. 138

Emily opens the front door for Joan and Lisa.

Hi. I'm Joan. It's nice to meet you.

Nice to meet you too. Come on in.

Hi Emily.

139 INT. EMILY'S APARTMENT -- LIVING ROOM. DAY. 139

Emily, Joan and Lisa settle on the sofa and chairs.

.I had a friend who used to live on this

block, at 262...?

Oh...?

Yeah, I don't know if you know her.

Cheryl Rowan? She's a physiotherapist?

No, I don't know her.

I think about a thousand people must...

What?

Nothing...

Lisa says you're in a play, Joan?

Oh -- Yeah...

You should go see it, it's really good.

Well, the play is great, and it's a really

nice cast..-.

She's just being modest. She's gonna win

every award in New York.

Oh -- all that stuff's a long way off.

I don't go to the theater very much.

Well, it's just nice, because you can work

a long time in the theater and play really

good parts without getting a lot of

recognition. And even though you don't

necessarily do it for that as your primary

motive, it is very nice when people do

notice something you've done.

Uh huh...

I was on a television show a few years ago,

and I had been doing theater all my life,

and suddenly all my relatives started

calling me up to congratulate me because

they thought I finally Made It. And it was

really just this dumb show that paid the

bills for a while...

That show was so stupid.

It wasn't that bad...! Anyway: I realize

this is horribly embarrassing for Lisa, but

I really wanted to meet you, Emily, because

you've frankly become such a big part of

Lisa's life, and I don't want to be

intrusive, but this whole court case seems

to be suddenly dominating everything and I

can't get Lisa to tell me anything about it

That's not true...!

Well, I can't...! And I want you to know,

Lisa, that I'm very, very proud of you for

pursuing this the way you have.

But I can't let you pursue it to the point

where it's taking over your life or

interfering with your school work. (To

EMILY) It's really come down to a question

of homework. Lisa is on a half-scholarship

at her school. And I know she feels a real

sense of responsibility about what happened

Yeah, I do.

I know you do. I know you do. But you can't

not do your homework, and you can't throw

away your scholarship because of it.

I'm not. My grades slipped a little.

They'll get better. Anyone can do their

homework. You just sit down and do it.

I've been distracted. I'll stop.

All right --

We didn't need to have a big conference

about it.

It's not a big conference, I just want to

know what's going on. And I wanted to meet

Emily... (to EMILY) I know it's a little

awkward!

Don't apologize. If Lisa hasn't been

keeping you apprised of what's been going

on, I think she should. You should.

There's nothing to keep her apprised of.,

We're just waiting for them to schedule the

Discovery conference.

Now what is that?

Mom? It really doesn't matter.

A Discovery conference is a meeting with

the court where they sign an order.

authorizing our lawyer to begin getting the

personnel records, interviewing witnesses,

talking to Monica's cousin...

OK, now where does she fit in?

She gets the money.

140 EXT. MIDTOWN HOTEL. DAY. 140

ABIGAIL BERWITZ, 40s, gets out the taxi as the driver comes

around with her matching luggage.

141 INT. DEUTSCH'S OFFICE. DAY. 141

Abigail sits with Deutsch.

How would you describe the relationship

overall? Did you talk on the phone a

lot? Were there a lot of visits --

I would say we talked on the phone a couple

of times a month at least. Sometimes more

than that...I would call her, she would

call me...

And what were the nature of these

conversations?

ABIGAIL.

Oh, family stuff, mostly. Her family, my

kids...

And she would advise you about your family?

That kind of thing?

Oh, I would say so, yes.

Would you have any phone records? Or --

I have all my phone bills, if that's what

you mean. I didn't record the actual

conversations...

No no --

You'll see we talked on the phone quite

frequently.

OK, that's terrific. I see you came

prepared...1

Well, I wanted to bring everything.

Now when they take your deposition you're

gonna say the same thing you just told me.

Talk about the relationship...

Uh huh?

Kind of advice she used to give you...

OK...?

142 INT. MIDTOWN RESTAURANT. DAY. 142

Emily, Lisa and Abigail sit over their lunch. Abigail is

drinking a white wine.

Now, Emily, where did you find this lawyer?

He was recommended by a friend.

I'm asking because my husband knows a real

good New York lawyer, and I'm not entirely

comfortable with someone that no one has

ever heard of --

My friend's heard of him. He says he's very

good..

I'm sure he does. But I have a

responsibility in this situation, and I

would feel a whole lot more comfortable

with somebody who didn't just drop in out

of the clear blue sky...

He didn't drop in out of the clear blue

sky. He was recommended by my friend.

But even if we switched lawyers we'd still

have to pay him. But it all comes out of

the settlement, so it's really up to you.

No, if you all think he's good...

I don't know whether he is or not. My

friend thinks he is.

All right. Now Lisa, what is your

involvement in all this? What's your angle?

I just wanted to...I was just there.

143 INT. EMILY'S DINING ROOM. DAY. 143

Emily comes into the dining room with a cup of coffee. Lisa

is standing over the table looking at some of Monica's photos

and belongings which are spread out all over the table. Emily

starts putting the pictures away in their envelopes.

Oh my God, is that you?

That's me.

And that's you and Monica obviously. Oh my

God. Is that her daughter?

Uh huh.

God... So how old was she when she died?

Twelve.

God. I can't even imagine.

Neither could we.

Emily sits down and starts sorting through pictures to put

them in the box. Lisa sits down too.

You know Monica asked about her when she

was dying?

Emily looks up.

No. I didn't.

Yeah. I think she was confused... like, I

think she thought I was her daughter for a

minute. And then she was asking me to call

her, like to tell her what happened: You

know, like she didn't remember she was

dead.

What do you mean? What did she say?

She just asked if somebody could call her

daughter. But then it got confusing because

I said, "Sure, what's her name?" And she

said her name was Lisa. And I said, "No,

that's my name." Because it took me a

minute -- I didn't realize we had the same

name...

Emily does not respond.

was registering with her.

Emily does not respond.

But then when I found out her daughter was

dead, ever since then I keep having this

really strong feeling that some way, for

those last five minutes I kind of was her

daughter. You know? Like maybe that's the

reason I was there: Like in some weird way,

this obviously amazing woman got to see her

daughter again for a few minutes, right

before she died.

I see. And is she still inhabiting your

body? Or did she go right back to the

spirit world after it was over?

I didn't mean she ws literally inhabiting

my body. I don't believe in all that stuff

at all.

I don't give a fuck what you believe in.

Oh my God! Why are you so mad at me!?

Because this is not an opera!

What? You think I think this is an opera?

Yes!

You think I'm making this into a dramatic

situation because I think it's dramatic?!?

I think you're very young.

What does that have to do with anything?

If anything I think it means I care more

than someone who's older! Because this kind

of thing has never happened to me before!

No, it means you care more easily! There's

a big difference! Except that it's not you

it's happening to!

Yes it is! I know I'm not the one who

was run over --

That's right, you weren't. And you're not

the one who died of leukemia, and you're

not the one who just died in an earthquake

in -- Algeria! But you will be. Do you

understand me? You will be. And it's not

an opera and it's not dramatic --

I'm well aware of that!

And this first-blush phony deepness of

yours is worth nothing.

Oh wow.

Do you understand? It's not worth anything,

because it'll be troweled over in a month

or two. And then when you get older, and

you don't have a big reaction every time a

d gets run over, then, then we'll find

out what kind of a person you are! But this

is nothing! I'm sorry, but I didn't start

this conversation and I don't play these

games.

(drawing herself up)

I am not --

saying anything very outrageous! I'm

telling you to knock it off! You have every

right to falsify your own life, but you

have no right to falsify anyone else's.

It's what makes people into Nazis! And I'm

sorry, but it's a little suspicious that

you're making such a fuss about this when

you didn't know her, and you're having

troubles with your own mother --

Oh my God!

But this is nm life we're talking about,

much more than it is yours! Because it's my

real friend who got killed, who I'm never

going to see again, really! Whom I have

known since I was nineteen years old

myself. OK? And I don't want that sucked

into some kind of adolescent self-

dramatization!

I'm not fucking dramatizing anything!

(not having it)

I was there, and you weren't! And if I

happen to express myself a little

hyperbolically, Emily, that's just the way

I talk! I can't help it if my mother is an

actress! Why are you being so fucking

strident?

Strident?

Yeah.

OK. Um, you should leave.

Why? Because I called you strident?

Yeah: Strident? You should leave. Thanks.

I don't wanna be called strident and you're

deliberately misunderstanding me!

No I'm not! You're insulting me enough as

it is: You don't have to call me stupid

too!

Well I can't stop you doing this so I think

you had better go.

OK! I will.

NOW!

OK! Let me get my purse!

Lisa grabs her purse and coat. Emily half-walks, half-drives

her toward the door.

Does this mean we're dropping the whole

inquiry?

It means you're leaving. I don't know what

else it means.

All I meant by saying you were strident was

that you were being emphatic! I obviously

misused the word!

Look it up when you get home.

Jesus Christ. You're amazing.

Yeah. Uh huh. I'm amazing.

(bursts into tears)

Why are you doing this... .!

Lisa, I'm not doing anything! I'm a human

being! Monica was a human being! So was

her daughter! And so is your mother!

We are not supporting characters in the

fascinating story of your life!

I never said or thought you were...! And I

really didn't mean to call you strident! I

totally misused the word! I wasn't trying

to insult you, Emily, I really wasn't! I

feel so bad about what happened and I'm

trying so hard to do something about it!

And I don't understand why if I say

something wrong you can't just give me a

break! I didn't mean I thought her daughter

took over my body. I'm not an idiot. It was

just this feeling I had because she was

holding onto my hand so hard before she

died, and because we had the same first

name!

OK...

But I'm not trying to dramatize anything,

Emily. I really know about that trend, and

I really don't think I've been doing that.

OK. I believe you. And look up "strident."

I will.

They kiss and make up, but it's still a little ugly.

143A INT. COHEN LIVING ROOM. NIGHT 143A

Lisa, Joan and Curtis are watching Joan being interviewed on

TV. We don't see the screen.

I've been in the theater my whole life and

nothing like this has ever happened to

me...

INTERVIEWER ON TV(O.C.)

Now, any talk of the play becoming a film?

JOAN ON TV (O.C.)

Oh, I'm sure. But I would never get cast in

that. I'm not a movie star.

INTERVIEWER ON TV (O.C.)

But you're a theater star...

JOAN ON TV (O.C.)

I don't know about that either...

143A CONTINUED: 143A

You are!

I guess...!

Oh God.

Joan buries her face in her hands. Lisa watches scowling.

134

143B INT. COHEN KITCHEN. NIGHT. 143B

Joan is serving Lisa and Curtis dinner.

Lisa? Do you think Emily would like to

come see the play? I thought you could

both come and them maybe we could go out

afterwards.

All right. Let me ask her.

Dig in everybody...

They start eating.

I was thinking about spending next year

with Dad.

Oh?

Yeah. You're all worried about my grades.

They have really good public schools in

Santa Monica, and if Iofficially lived

with him, you wouldn't have to worry about

my scholarship.

Have you talked to him about this?

We've had some general discussions.

Do you want to go too?

Me?

Yeah. Do you want to move to LA too?

No.

Well, just let me know if you do.

143B CONTINUED: 143B

Why are you being like this?

Why am I being like what?

Why are you about to start crying?

Because it's your intention to make me

start crying!

No it's not --

You want to move to LA. Move to LA.

But why can't this even be mentioned

without you taking it personally? I'm just

introducing a possibility!

OH!

Joan upsets everything on the table and starts to go. She

comes back and upsets more things on the table.

Here's a possibility that you

can make your own fucking

dinner! Here's a possibility LISA

that you can do whatever you Jesus Christ!

want to do, because I don't What is with you?

even care anymore, you heartless

little fuckin' bitch!

Fine! Keep it up! It really makes me want

to stay here!

You think you're so fucking perfect!?

She breaks something else and walks out.

No.

Good one.

Shut up.

Green Revised 10/7/05 - Page 136

145 INT. HISTORY CLASS. DAY. 145

On the blackboard Klein finishes writing: SHOULD TEENAGERS

RULE THE WORLD? YES OR NO?

OK. Go ahead: Kirsten. Lionel: Put your

drum away.

Lionel stops drumming on his desk with his fingers.

I think that teenagers should definitely

rule the world, because teenagers aren't

corrupted by adult life yet, and they're

idealists and they care. And I know a lot

of people feel that teenagers are really

naive, which they are, many of them. But

they still haven't had a chance to get

burned out by the disappointments and the

harsh realities of learning how to play the

game. So yes, I would vote yes.

All right: Lisa?

I would tend to agree with all of that,

except I do think that teenagers don't

always necessarily think things through

very carefully, and they don't have enough

experience to know what the right thing to

do is all the time. I also think they tend

to adhere to ideologies really easily

without having actually bothered to think

them through for themselves.--

Such as what?

Such as what? Such as, gee, I don't know:

the Hitler Youth?

OK... Hitler Youth.

Or what about all these teenage suicide

bombers? Not that I want to get into the

whole Palestinian thing again, but assuming

you don't think suicide bombing is a good

thing, wouldn't you say that's an example

of being idealistic without using your

critical faculties?

And maybe running the risk of having your

youthful enthusiasm be co-opted by adults

for purposes of their own that you might

not even ultimately agree with?

Angie's hand shoots up. So do several others.

OK, Angie?

Yeah, I don't want to get into the whole

Palestinian thing again either, because

I realize I'm completely outnumbered --

Not unlike the Palestinians themselves.

That's not really funny, Anthony.

OK, OK! Monica?

Well, I don't know if this is good or bad,

but speaking of ideology, it's interesting

that the suicide bombers -- just for

example -- care enough about what they

believe in to sacrifice their lives for it.

Yes. Yes!

I think it's fine if you want to sacrifice

your life for what you believe in. I

actually think that's really noble. It's a

little different when you're willing to

sacrifice someone else's life, you know? I

personally don't think that's such a big

Hey!

Silence.

If you ladies can't make your points

without yelling or interrupting each other

or raising your hands, I'd say it was a

pretty good argument for "No."

Why, adults don't yell and interrupt each

other?

Lisa!

Sorry.

Let's try to put this in a broader

perspective. The question was not actually

who's to blame in the Arab Israeli conflict

The Israelis.

OK, you're a moron.

(he's had enough)

Lisa!

You're not even Jewish, Lisa! The next Goddamn person who

LISA raising their hand is.

I'm fuckin' half-Jewish, and outta this class!

who cares what I am? I'm anti-

murder, not pro-Israel. LEWIS

Fine. Thank you.

Lisa passes the blackboard, grabs some chalk and checks "NO. "

By the way, she just proved my point.

No I didn't. Lisa, GO!

Lisa leaves. Lewis turns to the class.

An O.C. burst of APPLAUSE takes us to --

146 INT. THEATER LOBBY. NIGHT. 146

Ramon CLAPS as Joan comes out to greet him, Lisa and Emily.

That's the best show yet! Every time it's

a better performance.

God, thank you! Hi, Emily, thanks so much

for coming...

Oh, thank you for the tickets.

Pause. Joan waits for Emily or Lisa to say something nice.

Shall we go?

147 INT. RESTAURANT/BAR. NIGHT. 147

Joan, Lisa, Emily and Ramon are having drinks.

-- and I guess I lost my cool a little,

but I just love it'when people start

comparing the Israelis to Nazis...

But who is running these discussions...?

Well, but Lisa, you have to remember, it's

always easy for the dominant side to be

content with the status quo.

Mmm.

How do you mean, Ramon?

I mean the oppressor is always in favor of

law and order because it's his law and his

order. He uses violence to maintain his

position and calls it the rule of law. But

when the person underfoot uses violence to

change his status he's called a criminal

and a terrorist, and the violence of the

State is called upon to put him down, and

once again it's called the rule of law. In

I see. And what would you like them to do?

Pause.

"They" meaning --

The Jew oppressors. What would you like

them to do?

Pause.

I didn't use that expression. EMILY

But since you ask - No, you didn't. (i.e.

"You didn't have to.")

Um, I just spent the whole day arguing

about this: I didn't really mean to bring

it up again.

(turning on her)

Don't handle me.

I'm not handling you.

What did you think of the play?

And I think it's ironic in Don't bother, Mom.

of Nazis find it essential EMILY

leaving.

(agreeing with Emily)

That's what I think!

Emily tries to unhook her purse from the back of her chair.

That seems excessive, Emily, come on --

That's the response. That's the Jewish

response.

It's the what?

It's the Jewish response. You don't like

what I am saying or what I do, so you --

That's my Jewish response.

Emily throws her drink in his face and walks away.

Oh my God...!

It's all right...(Wiping off his face)

That's all right... It's a perfect little

.encapsule...It's the Jewish response.

A horrible silence as they watch Ramon clean his shirt.

142

148 INT. JOAN'S ROOM. NIGHT. 148

Joan is getting ready-for bed. Lisa appears in the doorway.

Sorry about all that tonight.

Yeah. Your friend is a delight.

She's a really passionate person. She

really cares about things.

She's rude, Lisa. Ramon was my guest, not

hers. And-so.was she, as a matter of fact --

So what? Why is it so JOAN

important that people be No -- I'm not ar -- I'm

polite all the time? Why not arguing about this with

is that the big priority? you! I'm not interested in

an exchange of ideas. As it

happens Ramon said a few

things I wasn't too crazy

about either, so I guess

that's the end of that...

Oh is that supposed to be Emily's fault

too?

I don't want to talk to you right now.

Please go away.

149 INT. RAMON'S OFFICE. DAY. 149

to do? I'm not going to beg you.

150 INT. COHEN KITCHEN/KARL'S HOUSE. DAY. 150

Joan enters slowly and checks the water on the stove. Lisa

is eating a carrot and reading a magazine. Silence.

Well...? How's that anti-Semitic piece of

shit Ramon?-

Oh God, I don't know.

The PHONE RINGS. Lisa picks up.

Hello?

Yeah. It's Dad.

151 INT. KARL'S HOUSE. DAY.- 151

Hi, Dad, how are you? I'm really looking

forward to our horseback riding trip...

Yeah. That's why I'm calling. I don't think

it's going to happen.

Really? What's the matter?

Nothing's the matter. Nobody seems to

really want to go, and I don't really feel

like spending three thousand bucks on

something nobody has the slightest interest

in. So I think it's obviously better for

everyone if we just cancel.

I never said I didn't want to go.

Well, I can't seem to get a straight answer

about what anybody wants to eat, um,

Annette is giving me a hard time about her

schedule, I talk to Curtis and all I get

are monosyllables, so --

I think-he's really looking forward to it --

Uh huh? Well, you know, that hasn't really

been my impression. So, uh...I also think

it would be good to shelve the idea of your

coming out here next year.

It looks like things are gonna start

picking up for me in the Fall, which means

I'm probably not gonna be around the house

all that much, and since you and Annette

detest each other, I don't, uh, I don't

think that's what I want to come home to

after a fourteen hour day.

We don't detest each other

OK, well, it doesn't really strike me as

something you're that serious about anyway,

so what do you say we just table it for the

time being?

OK.

OK. So tell Curtis, uh, that New Mexico's

off...Ummm, and I will talk to you, ummm,

whenever.

OK...

Yeah.

He hangs up. LISA hangs up too.

What's wrong?

Dad's cancelling the trip.

What? Why?

He's says nobody wants to go and he doesn't

want to spend the money.

Did you say you didn't want to go?

No, I know there was some problem with

Annette about arranging for food because I

don't eat dead animals, but.I didn't think

it was.going to wreck the whole trip.

Oh boy.

I thought you said it sounded like it was

going to be a disaster. Personally I'm

relieved. I'm not moving out there, either,

by the way, obviously. Which is fine too.

152 INT. KARL'S HOUSE. DAY. 152

Karl sits holding the phone in a savage depression.

153 INT. MR AARON'S APARTMENT. DAY. 153

Lisa sits on a sofa. She takes a sip of coffee.

Thank you for letting me come up. I don't

know who else to talk to.

She's talking to MR AARON, who looks very uncomfortable.

That's all right...

You've always been very sympathetic to my

craziness, and I may not show it all the

time, but I actually really appreciate it.

It's no problem, Lisa. What's been going

on?

I just need to talk to somebody who doesn't

completely misunderstand who Iam. Or not

even who I am, but what's going on inside

me, or all around me. Sound confused

enough? Anyway, for whatever reason, I

always felt like we understood each other

on some level, even though I'm like a mass

of conflicting impulses and you're

basically the most grown-up, rational man I

know.

Well...I doubt that's actually true

but thank you...

You seem pretty fuckin' rational to me.

Like that seems to be your leading feature.

I mean you obviously have a lot of pretty

deep feelings...So when you're rational -

just to finish my thought -- it's like this

really interesting way of governing

yourself.

And you don't have to get all uncomfortable

again: I'm not talking about what you think

I'm talking about, because I know that

subject is-off-limits. I'm talking about

your soul, I guess, and how you feel you

have to keep it in check all the time by

being sensible. Do you know what I'm saying

at all?

Well...We all have feelings, Lisa. I happen

to believe that who you are comes out of

how you deal with those feelings. Somebody

makes you mad, you don't just pick up a gun

and shoot them...Or if you do, that says

something about who you are, and how you've

been raised...

Well, I don't want to disillusion you, but

we happen to be living in a world where

that is what people do. More often than

not.

That's not true, Lisa. I think it's very

sad that you see it that way. There's

eight billion people alive in the world and

you think they don't all want to kill

someone once in a while? But they don't.

Most of them. Or they see some person they

-- (Pause) I think most people do try to be

civilized by some standard. Even if it's a

standard you and I might not agree with...

No, I get it. That's actually the most

hopeful thing anybody's said to me for a

long time. I don't know why I take such a

dire view of things, I really don't.

She removes her jacket. She's wearing a small clingy T-shirt.

Just a little hot...A little warm .Is

this all right?

Sure.

Do you allow smoking in your apartment?

You can smoke.

She gets her cigarettes out and lights one. He gets up and

brings her an ashtray. They meet at the sofa and sit.

I like your apartment.

Thank you.

She blows some smoke out and waves it away.

Sorry.

That's all right.

This is terrible.

What is? What's terrible?

I just like you so much...(Smooths her ash

on the ashtray.) Sorry. What a moron.

(taking her hand)

Hey. Lisa. I'm your friend. And that's not

gonna change. That's not gonna change.

Thanks. Thank you.

She kisses his hand a couple of times.

Lisa...

Please just let me for a second. I like you

so much. I like you so, so much.

She kisses his hand more elaborately. He lets this go on.

she slides her hand onto his leg.

OK, look...

Don't stop me yet, OK?

They kiss some more. She bends down to unzip his fly.

Please don't do that.

Just let me for one second...

She bends her head over his lap. He lets her.

154 INT. MR AARON'S APARTMENT. LATER. 154

Don't stop. It's OK.

Are you all right?

Yes, yes, you don't have to keep asking me

that.

I think we should stop.

No, keep going...!

She keeps pushing against him.

155 INT. MR AARON'S APARTMENT. LATER. 155

AT THE DOOR. She is leaving. He is burning with guilt and

shame. Silence. Then:

All I can say is I better get a pretty

fuckin' good grade in geometry this year.

(Pause) Lighten up! I'm kidding.

Sorry. I really didn't expect anything like

this to happen. I'm really not sure how to

react.

Don't worry. I'm not gonna tell anybody if

that's what you're worried about. I totally

initiated the whole thing.

Anyway, it's just sex. You're acting like a

little kid. I'll see you in school.

She walks out. He is very flummoxed.

156 INT. DEUTSCH'S OFFICE. DAY. 156

Lisa and Emily sit in the office with Deutsch.

Well, they want to settle.

They do...?

I have a meeting with their lawyer this

afternoon, and they want to discuss a

settlement. So we should get Abigail on the

phone and talk about what-we're gonna do.

Fantastic.

Lisa gets tears in her eyes and smiles, embarrassed.

Sorry.

That's OK.

husband the floor because he had a few

Mr Deutsch, I had the thought, if they're

willing to settle so quickly, maybe we're

better off waiting a little bit, maybe

rattling the sabre a little bit more...

Yes, if they're so quick to agree to a

settlement on this basis --

What you gotta realize -- What you gotta

Abigail, Russel doesn't think -- Sorry, go

ahead.

No, no...

My friend had a lot of trouble getting the

one story placed in the paper as it is --

.Could I interject?

But if they responded so strongly based on

one story...

Maybe we're cuttin' our own throats here.

They are responding to the story in the

paper...

.That's just common sense.

But what you gotta understand is they're

offering to settle now because they want to

get the story out of the paper.

That's why Russel thinks -- Besides, the main point is

not to jack up the price.

I'm sorry --

-- We didn't hear that last.

(to EMILY and LISA)

Ladies, let me just -- Abigail. Rob.

If I could finish my thought -- They're

jumpin' at the bait right now, but if

another six months goes by we run a serious

risk of losing our momentum. You see what I

mean? Now I'm gonna hit 'em very very hard,

I guarantee you. That's why I wanted all of

us together on the phone, so we could talk

about your other terms, besides the

damages. I promise you, we'ere gonna be

very very aggressive --

What other terms would there be?

What do you mean, like some kind of a fund?

A what?

Some kind of fund? For the kids?

I don't understand what you mean by a

fund...

(to ABIGAIL) Mr. Deutsch? Do you mean

What does he mean, "besides some kind of trust fund,

the damages?" a fund that would be set

up by the bus company for

EMILY our kids? For tax purposes?

What fuckin' fund?

These people are retarded.

Because I have to tell you we have just

lived through that nightmare with Monica

and our children, and it was not a pleasant

experience. We just want a clean, straight

damages is fine. A regular payment.

We'll pay the taxes on it. At least we'll

have something in our hand...

I don't really know what kind of fund

you're talking about...

We're not talking about --

Hi, this is Lisa? We're ABIGAIL

talking -- We're talking Hello, Lisa.

about -- Hello?

Pause.

We're still here.

We're talking about the driver, getting

the driver fired --

Oh, yes --

-- as part of the conditions.

Yes, Abigail, it's very important to us

that the company know that's an absolute

pre-condition to making any kind of

settlement whatsoever.

Oh yes. Absolutely. If you think he's at

Just as long as they don't think they can

buy us off just by gettin' rid of this guy.

You see what I mean?

Absolutely.

What we're most concerned about here is the

amount.

Yes, we're getting that, Rob.

But you see what I mean?

Yes -- Rob? Yes I do.

I just want to go on record as saying I

think this whole meeting is premature.

Absolutely. We're not lawyers --

Abigail? Rob? I just wanna make something

clear. One conversation does not commit you

to anything.

And I'm not gonna agree to anything without

consulting you. But I'm working for you.

158 INT. COHEN APARTMENT. DAY. 158

Lisa has just told Joan the news. Joan is on the sofa.

Lisa, I'm really proud of you!

Thank you.

Really, really proud...!

Thank you.

Pause. Joan gets to her feet and starts tidying up.

Are you upset about something...?

No. This house is really beginning to get

to me. And I'm a little confused what to do

about Ramon. I mean, you were there: What

do you think?

Uh, gee, Mom maybe you should really think

about it some more. Because it would

probably hurt Ramon's feelings if you broke

up with him and I think you better think

about it before you do something like that

to him.

I know I'm supposed to understand what

you're doing right now, but if there's some

kind of hidden message here I'm not getting

it.

No shit. You're on your own, Mom.

Thanks a lot.

You're welcome.

The PHONE RINGS. Joan picks it up.

Hello? -Yes . WHAT DO YOU MEAN??

Yes? . Yes? (To LISA) Ramon had a heart

attack.

uiet!

CURTIS appears. They both watch Joan at the phone. Instead

of dissolving, Joan listens, straightens up and calms down as

the person on the phone talks.

159 EXT. RIVERSIDE CHAPEL. DAY. 159

Mourners are going inside the funeral parlor.

160 INT. FUNERAL PARLOR. DAY. 160

Joan and Lisa look around the room.

OK, I'm really not trying to be funny, but

isn't this a Jewish funeral home?

I guess they do both.

They notice a few too many good-looking women crying a little

too hard. Lisa and Joan look at each other.

RODRIGO, a handsome slender kid of 20, comes up to Joan. His

accent is British, with a slight Colombian cadence.

Excuse me. Joan?

Yes. You must be Rodrigo. Oh my God, oh I'm

so sorry.

She impulsively embraces him.

Rodrigo, this is my --

I want to tell you, Joan, my Dad talked

about you all the time.

He did?

Yes. The night he met you, he called me in

England and woke me to tell me about it, he

was so excited. I never heard him talk

about anyone like that since my mother

died.

Really?

I don't know if this is appropriate...

No it's OK...!

.but he went out a lot. Do you know the

last time I spoke to him he told me from

the moment he met you he knew he wanted to

marry you, because for the first time since

he lost my mother, he finally met a woman

he could really connect with.

(at a total loss)

Well -- he was a very sweet man. And I know

he loved you and your brother very much.

Yeah, I know he did. Thank you.

161 INT. LISA'S ROOM. DAY. 161

Lisa is at her computer. Joan is by the doorway.

Thanks for coming with me today. I really

appreciate it.

Oh, you're welcome.

I don't want to be macabre, but Ramon and I

were supposed to go to hear The Tales of

Hoffman the week after next and I still

have the tickets. Would you be interested

in going? Or should I give them away?

Um, I'll go.

OK. It's Monday night. We can dress up.

OK.

What did you make of that?

People don't relate to each other, Mom.

They're totally disconnected. And if they

have any time for each other at all, it's

either like a biological imperative or like

some weird cultural anomaly. That's what I

make of it.

Well...I think it's pretty unfortunate that

you think that. Because I feel like you and

I used to relate to each other really well.

I'm not trying to hurt your feelings.

It's just a general observation.

OK...Hey, could I get a hug?

Sure.

Lisa rises and hugs Joan. It's not a good hug.

I just feel totally at sea.

They break apart.

162 INT. DINER. DAY. 162

Mr Aaron and Lisa sit in a booth. Mr Aaron looks grim.

I've thought about this a great deal, and

I'm going to come forward.

Oh brother.

What does that mean?

"You're gonna come forward." And do what?

You didn't kill anybody.

You just had sex with me after I

practically begged you to. You're a guy.

"I'm gonna come forward."

Well, that's what I'm comfortable doing.

Suit yourself. I'll deny everything and

you're gonna look like a total psycho.

And then my Mom'11 have you arrested, and

then spend the rest of her life feeling bad

about it. So why don't we just skip the

whole thing and forget about it?

I'm not sure I know how to do that.

You'll learn.

163 INT. LISA'S BATHROOM. NIGHT. 163

Lisa looks at a pregnancy test stick. Both lines are red.

164 INT. JOAN'S ROOM. NIGHT. 164

Joan looks up as Lisa comes in.

Good news!

165 INT. LISA'S BATHROOM. NIGHT. 165

Joan and Lisa are looking at the little stick.

OK. What do you want to do?

What do you mean? Aren't JOAN

you going to tell me. It's your body. It's your

what to do? (half- baby. What do you want to do?

laughing) Baby... .?

Yes! Now who is the father?

It could be a lot of people.

Joan looks at her. Lisa haltingly holds her ground. Joan

takes a sympathetic step toward her. Lisa shrinks back. Joan

stops. Her expression hardens.

Who.

I'm never gonna tell you, Mom! It's against

my principles! Such as they are.

No, but you want to send that bus driver to

jail for running a red light! And you won't

tell me about these boys?

166 INT. GYNECOLOGIST WAITING ROOM/HALL/RECOVERY ROOM. 166

Joan waits. She looks around the small room. There are two

couples and two lone women. A NURSE appears.

Mrs. Cohen?

TRACKING Joan as she gets up and follows the Nurse down a

hall...

.she's still a little woozy from the

anaesthetic...

Joan goes into the recovery room. Lisa is on the table in a

crumpled paper robe, looking like a small crumpled piece of

paper herself. Joan sits down.

Hi.

Hi honey.

I'm sorry, Mom.

Let's talk about it later.

167 INT. DEUTSCH'S OFFICE. DAY.

Deutsch sits with Emily and Lisa. The Berwitzes are on the

speaker phone.

I'm very pleased to be able to inform you

all that I had a long meeting with the

lawyer for the bus company, and they've

agreed to settle out of court for three

hundred and fifty thousand dollars.

What! Fantastic! That's wonderful!

Yes, fantastic That is fantastic!

But I gotta -- obviously I gotta bring

the offer to you, get your approval --

Mr Deutsch...?

Now, I know there was a concern after our

last call that we were jumping the gun a

little bit --

That's OK --

We're only --

Abigail? Rob? If we could just listen to

what Russel has to say, and then talk about

it once he's told us the whole story and

given us his recommendation...

Yes. Sorry. Fire away.

I was gonna say I know there was a concern

after our last call that we were jumping

the gun a little bit --

That's OK --

We were just --

Would you let him talk please?!

It's OK.

We're sorry.

I want to tell you I think it's a very good

offer.

I think they're very anxious to settle, but

I also do think that at this moment they're

under the maximum amount of pressure we can

really bring to bear, and I don't believe

they're gonna come up any higher --

Hey. Three hundred and fifty thousand

dollars...

OK, now let me just --

.that's nothin' to sneeze at.

I just want to introduce Now, 1 think -- Can

the thought -- you all hear me?

DEUTSCH, EMILY, LISA

Yes!

Yeow! Was that everybody? OK:

What about --

-- Emily? What do you think?

I think it sounds like we should do it.

But I'd like to discuss some of the --

Hey, if that's the vote...

Unless you think there's something to be

gained from holding out for more.

I think it would be a big mistake.

Robbie, what do you think?

Sold!

Sold!

OK. Now the only down side to this as it

stands -- and the reason I asked Emily and

Lisa to be here is because I know this may

be a serious wrinkle for you all -- is that

the bus company will absolutely not discuss

the removal of the driver.

What?

What do you mean?

The driver?

Then forget it. Tell them to What do you mean they

forget it. won't discuss the removal

Please. Ladies. Let me ROB

finish what I'm saying. Whoa -- hello!

It's just a blast in our ears.

Let him finish.

Finish what? Forget it!

Thank you. I want you to understand, Lisa,

I pressed them very very hard on this, but

they will not discuss disciplining of a

company employee as part of the settlement

because it could be seen as an admission of

guilt on the part of the MTA --

What does giving us three hundred thousand

dollars mean?

Settling out of court does not imply an

admission of guilt. It simply does not

carry the same stigma. On top of that you

may not know, Lisa, they're involved in a

very tricky labor dispute at the MTA right

Yeah, we know all about that! Just tell

them to forget it.'

I know that's your reaction...

It's the only reason we're here.

Hello? Are you still with us? Please!

It's Emily's decision.

No.

No.

Hello?

It's not?

They're not listening, Robbie.

It's Abigail's decision because she's the

next of kin.

But she didn't even know about it!

That doesn't matter.

Could we get back in this conversation

please?

Yes. I'm sorry. Obviously there's some very

strong emotions going either way on this --

Listen, Emily? I don't know what you're

thinking, but Rob and I are thinking we

should take Russel's recommendation while

we can. Because if they won't fire the

guy, they're not gonna fire him. And six

months or a year from now we're gonna --

Exactly.

we're gonna be in a situation where

we're beggin' them for half this much,

which is gonna hurt 'em half as much as

now, and they're still not gonna fire this

guy! Or maybe he'll have already quit and

the whole thing will be moot by then.. Do

you see what I mean?

The entire point of the lawsuit was to get

the guy fired so he doesn't kill somebody

else -- !

Lemme just clarify --

-- it was not to get you three hundred and

fifty thousand dollars you didn't know you

were entitled to, for somebody you didn't

even like... !

This is a distortion --

And the only reason you're getting the

money at all is because I started this

whole fucking thing in motion! I'm sorry

for swearing, but you should be willing to

trade in all the money for getting this guy

off the street --

For getting him, Abigail!

Well I'm sorry, but I have a responsibility

to Monica and I take that responsibility

very seriously. You are talking about an

offer that is gonna be withdrawn if we

don't do something about it right now.

And rather than being abused over the

telephone and cursed at for having the

courtesy to involve you in these

discussions, Lisa, I would hope you would

be guided by our judgement. Unless I'm

wrong about that.

None of that matters --

Unless I'm wrong about that. Just what is

your interest in this?

Because I'm the one who killed her! I'm

the one who killed her! But at least I

know I did it, and that guy has no idea!

And he's wandering around blaming everybody

else and all I want is for somebody to let

him know that what he did was wrong! And

if they don't fire him and all you want is

the money and the police won't do anything,

how is he gonna know he's wrong? You can't

take the deal, Abigail! It wasn't so you

could get any money, it was because we

wanted to get him fired! It doesn't matter

about the money! You wouldn't have gotten

it before!

Well it may not matter to you, but where I

come from three hundred and fifty thousand

dollars is an awful lot of money, and to my

mind is a positive result of all this

tragedy and not just negative. Not just

getting someone fired for one mistake, no

matter how bad it was --

Oh SHOVE IT UP YOUR ASS!

She knocks the speaker phone off the desk and runs to the

door in floods of tears.

Lisa!

You sleazy fucking lawyer! And you're a

moralistic cunt!

She runs out.

165

168 EXT. STREET. DAY. 168

TRACKING in front of Lisa as she walk-runs down the busy

street. A city bus appears behind her and goes by. She cranes

to see the driver. It's not her guy. She keeps going.

169 EXT. SCHOOL. DAY. 169

Lisa stands against a car, smoking, as the kids flow out of

the building. Mr Aaron comes out, talking with BONNIE, the

gymnastics teacher. They walk away from the school together.

Lisa catches up with them.

Hey, Lisa. What's Up?

Hey, did you guys know I had an abortion

last week?

Pause.

No. I didn't know that.

Yeah, it cost four hundred dollars.

Um, should I...

No, no, don't go anywhere.

Yeah, don't go anywhere.

Bonnie doesn't know what to make of this. Mr Aaron looks

steadily at Lisa.

Do you want to tell us about it?

Yeah. I do.

OK. -Go ahead.

Well...

She doesn't speak. Pause.

Do your parents know about this, Lisa?

Yes.

Have you told the father, honey?

No...There's a couple of people it could

be.

I think you better tell them. Whoever they

are.

No...No...Never mind ...I'm sure he's sorry

anyway, whichever one he is.

I don't see what difference that makes, if

he's sorry. And I think whoever it is

should know about this.

I'm sorry. I shouldn't have brought this

up. Please don't tell anyone.

We're not gonna tell anyone. But you're

gonna have to tell whoever it could be --

(On have to")

That's OK. I gotta go. Thanks for

listening. It's -- It doesn't matter about

the father, because the whole thing was my

fault. I'm sorry...!

She shakes her head and runs away.

What was that...?

170 INT. COHEN APARTMENT. DAY. 170

Lisa comes in. Curtis is doing his homework at the table.

Mom's looking for you.

What for?

She thinks you're going out with her

tonight.

Where are we going?

I don't know.

Lisa heads for her room. Joan appears, half-dressed.

Lisa? Honey? Did you forget we're going to

the opera?

Yes.

I didn't-remind you because I didn't want

to nag you.

It's OK.

171 EXT. BROADWAY -- NEAR LINCOLN CENTER. DUSK. 171

her arm.

Don't get run over.

A cab rattles by. Lisa looks down the street. A BUS is

approaching.

Wait. I want to see if that's him.

What.

They wait. The bus gets closer, heading straight toward them

and stops at the bus stop. Lisa grabs her mother's arm.

It is him. Mom, that's the one...

Joan and Lisa look at him. He's staring out ahead of him as

people board the bus. He SEES Lisa and Joan but can't see

their faces and doesn't recognize Lisa: He just sees two

dolled-up women under the street light. He smiles dazzling at

them and drives past with a short wave.

Joan looks at Lisa. She looks like she's about to throw up.

Come on. We're gonna miss the curtain.

168

172 EXT. METROPOLITAN OPERA -- OUTDOOR TERRACE. NIGHT. 172

Lisa is out on the terrace smoking a cigarette, looking out

over Lincoln Center. Joan comes out and stands next to her,

but Lisa won't look at her or interact.

Well, so far it's not the greatest opera I

ever heard.

What do you mean? It's OK.

The end-of-intermission chimes sound. People start going in.

Joan turns and goes in too. Lisa keeps smoking.

173 INT. METROPOLITAN OPERA -- ORCHESTRA. NIGHT. 173

barcarole "Belle Nuit." It's very beautiful.

Joan looks next to her at Lisa. Lisa is trying not to cry,

but tears are dripping slowly down her face. She sniffs and

wipes them away, but they keep coming.

Joan looks at her again, but Lisa still won't look at her.

Joan takes Lisa's hand and Lisa breaks down completely,

clutching Joan's hand back, squeezing it hard. Joan starts

crying too out of sympathy.

As the duet goes on they sit side by side holding hands, Lisa

crying and holding on and wiping her eyes with her free hand

and Joan crying too, but not as hard, grateful finally that

the spell has been broken.

The duet ends and we CUT TO BLACK.
