4 EXT. COLISEUM - PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT 4

BILLY presses a button on his portable radio and is hit

with sound of sports talk radio--

CUT TO WHAT BILLY'S BEEN LOOKING AT THIS WHOLE TIME -

Three enormous looming likenesses of the Oakland A's

premiere players on floodlit banners--Jason Giambi,

Johnny Damon, Jason Isringhausen.

From the radio we've been hearing shards of "--an

unprecedented choke--", "--get rid of Billy Beane--", "--

Billy Beane knows nothing about baseball--".

5 INT. OAKLAND AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY 5

The call's been disconnected. CUT TO: Another corridor,

as Billy and Tara head toward security. Billy on the

phone with Boras, continuing where they left off --

Billy drops the phone in a plastic container, steps

through the metal detector like it's a stick-up, grabs

the phone again.

Billy grabs his phone from the other side.

Boras hangs up.

Billy dials another number --

You want to send him flowers?

You're not going to be anywhere near

Hawaii.

To where he is now, yes.

Beth Israel Temple, Beverly Hills.

The airport is as close as you got.

Thank you, Tara.

Denise.

I'm Tara.

I know. I need a day.

One day. I'll fly out tomorrow.

It's gonna be more than one day.

We're losing Isringhausen too?

Only if my luck stays exactly the same.

It's like the bell rang but you're still

getting hit in the head.

Just in case.

I'm sorry. Have fun out there.

7 INT. SINAI TEMPLE - BRENTWOOD - LATER - DAY 7

8 INT. TEMPLE LOBBY - LATER - DAY 8

Billy stares, completely nonplussed...

Arn walks away. Billy looks to his right to see a 12 year

old kid standing right next to him.

Billy hands the kid his scotch --

-- and walks away.

15 INT. OAKLAND COLISEUM - SCOUTING ROOM - PRESENT DAY 15

On the left board - every player in the A's organization.

On the other, even larger board - every player that may

be of interest to them from the other organizations.

It's the most complex chess board you will ever see.

But what can be easily discerned are the obvious holes in

the A's team - the star players they are about to lose -

their names set apart from the positions they're

vacating: Jason Giambi (1B), Johnny Damon (CF), Jason

Isringhausen (RP).

Grady moves on --

Billy backs off, incredulous as the scouts prattle on --

Enough. Billy raises a book above the table, drops it

with a dull THUD... STOPPING TRAFFIC.

Everyone mumbles "no."

Look, we're gonna find 25 guys, put `em

through player development, teach `em how

to play Oakland A baseball. This is no

time to push the panic button. This is

the way we've been doing it for 150

years. Let us do our job.

If we try to play like the Yankees in

here, we're not going to be able to play

with them out there.

That's fortune cookie wisdom.

No, it's just regular wisdom.

Who's Fabio?

Okay, Billy. Clearly you have something

on your mind.

Bill James.

You're not serious?

We're not playing fantasy baseball,

Billy.

Those aren't new ideas, they disproved

that years ago.

Bill James was a night security guard at

the Stokely Van Camp Pork and Beans

Factory.

He thinks differently than anyone in

baseball.

He's not in baseball. He's in pork and

beans.

Chuckles.

Unanimous approval from the scouts --

Supportive. Excited about rebuilding the

Bonds is available.

Yeah, how do I afford the rest of the

field?

So what are you looking for? I want to

help out.

I guess you've touched the bottom of the

sports industry when your opponent is

I need a lefty reliever and I want

Ricardo Rincon.

Not going to happen.

Not even a discussion?

Come on Billy, even if you could afford

him we're not about to let him go.

Why's that? You've got the Venezuelan

kid in North Carolina you're bringing up.

We dished him to Detroit. Keep up.

Well there goes my other idea.

As Shapiro and gang review Guthrie's stats, Billy notices

Peter whispering to the guy next to him.

Shapiro looks around the room at the guys who don't

object.

19 INT. INDIANS CORPORATE OFFICES - DAY 19

Nothing from Peter.

20 INT. A VAST PARKING STRUCTURE - CONTINUOUS 20

I work for a different team.

I know, but I'm the first person in

baseball who's ever talked to you this

long. Right? Why is Garcia undervalued?

Okay, truthfully, it might not be so easy

to explain.

Really? Why's that Peter?

We might not see the game the same way.

Oh really? What do you mean by that?

You've spent your life in baseball and I

don't have a very traditional view of the

game.

Hey Pete, just say it. I'm not about to

beat you up. Say what you've always

wanted to say to a GM.

Baseball thinking is medieval. It's stuck

in the Dark Ages. I have a more

scientific view of the game.

Keep going, Peter.

There is an epidemic failure within the

game to understand what's really

happening. And it leads people who run

major league teams to misjudge their

players and mismanage their teams.

They're still asking the wrong questions.

People who run baseball teams still think

in terms of buying players. Sorry to say

that.

Peter, don't apologize for what you

believe.

ARCHIVAL VIDEO: The back of Johnny Damon's A's jersey as

he walks to the plate to adoring Oakland fans.

DAMON swings at the first pitch and knocks it into left

field for a single. He leads off first--

On the next pitch, DAMON takes off for second--

DAMON's tagged out at second.

26 INT. PETER'S OFFICE - NIGHT 26

Let's make sure we're on the same page.

Okay.

We're going to re-think baseball.

Yes.

Look for an inefficiencies in statistics.

Examine the ways that runs are scored and

prevented.

Exploit the fact that unspectacular runs

are just as valuable as 450-foot bombs.

Unspectacular runs are more valuable.

Why?

Because they cost less.

We believe there's a river that hasn't

been fished.

We know it for sure.

And because players have been overlooked

because they don't rise to the standards

of traditional baseball thinking, we

believe that in this river, there are

fish...fish who--

Help me with--

Forget the fish. In this room is every

available player at every level of

professional baseball, and somewhere in

that group are 25 players that everyone

has else has thrown out.

An island of misfit toys. In this room is

a championship team that we can afford.

Yes. But let me ask you this. If our

theory is right--

Math isn't a theory.

If it's right--

It's right.

It sounds right.

It is right.

If math isn't a theory--

It isn't.

I'm gonna punch you in the kidneys if you

don't let me finish a sentence.

Sorry.

If this is right, why isn't everybody

doing it? In fact, why isn't anybody

doing it?

Somebody once said, "It's not what you

don't know that worries me it's what you

know for sure that's got me scared." In

the mid-19th Century in Budapest there

was an incredibly high instance of

mothers dying shortly after childbirth

from a disease called puerperal fever.

35%.

Make this story less boring as soon as

you can.

31 INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE SCOUTING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 31

BILLY doesn't answer the question, just walks into the-

32 INT. SCOUTING ROOM - DAY 32

The scouts aren't sure what to say, and so say nothing.

Grady looks like a man who can't take much more.

He points to Peter.

The others aren't sure what confuses them more - the

logic, or the guy who shouldn't be in this room.

And that's all he's going to tell them about Peter.

Billy takes a Marks-A-Lot, jots down three names on

strips, and approaches the board.

He puts the first strip up. It reads: JEREMY GIAMBI.

Billy puts up another name: DAVID JUSTICE.

Billy points at PETER --

The SCOUTS consult their spreadsheets and then answer

He can get--

He can get on base.

Alright, so he walks a lot.

He gets on base a lot, Rocco. Do I care

if it's a walk or a hit?

You do not.

These three players, by your own

admission, are defective in one way or

another.

Yeah.

You want to replace Jason Giambi with not

one but three defective players?

You got it.

Billy, we've all been busting our asses

the last six and a half weeks to make

this a better ball--

Grady, it's not a discussion.

I think we're all losing sight of the

fact that you're the general manager.

You only have to answer to ownership and

God.

I didn't know God followed baseball.

I hope he does.

33 EXT/INT. TACOMA HOUSE - NIGHT 33

34 INT. SCOTT HATTEBERG'S HOUSE - LATER - NIGHT 34

SCOTT is so thrown by this that all he can do is stare at

BILLY. Then at WASHINGTON, who's shrug tells SCOTT "This

wasn't my idea."

HATTEBERG's YOUNG DAUGHTER comes down the staircase in

her pajamas, having just woken up in the middle of the

night.

BILLY doesn't like to share personal lives with the

players but he covers well--

BILLY takes a contract out of his windbreaker and sets it

on the table next to the cookies.

Beat.

Yes, and I've thought so my whole life.

And now we're gonna see if I'm--

--we're gonna see if you're right?! This

is about you and your shit? Some scouts

from 20 years ago called it wrong, okay?

They thought you were a ballplayer and

you weren't. As you know, it happens.

Don't take it out on--

I'm not--taking it out on--

I'm trying to help, okay, I'm saying--

No, you're not saying anything to me

right now.

Grady, you don't have special powers. You

don't have the ability to look at a guy

and "just know" because you're a scout

with special powers. I've watched you sit

at kitchen tables for years and tell the

parents of a 17 year old kid, "Trust me,

when I know, I know, and when it comes to

your son, I know" and you don't. We're

shopping in a new store--full of

complicated statistical analysis and

equations and I get that it turns your

world upside down but on base percentage--

our best chance to score on our budget

isn't getting a 6'4" Adonis to the plate,

it's getting a 5'10" washout who's

already at first base.

May I speak?

Yes.

Major League Baseball and its fans will

be happy to hand you and Google Boy your

heads if you keep doing what you're doing

here, I don't give a shit about

friendship this situation or the past.

Major League Baseball thinks the way I

think. You're not gonna win. And I'll

give you a nickel's worth of free advice.

I don't want to develop personal

relationships. I need to trade them, send

them down and sometimes cut them. You

should learn how to do that by the way.

The only way I'd have to cut a player is

if you oh come on!

Yeah, let's practice.

No.

I'm a player, cut me from the roster.

No.

Do it.

This is stupid.

Man-up, Yale.

Fine. Billy, would you have a seat for a

moment, I need to talk to you.

I'm already sitting.

I was pretending you weren't sitting.

But I am. Keep going.

This is the hardest thing there is to do

in baseball.

You got that from Bull Durham?

Yeah.

Hitting a curve ball is the hardest thing

there is to do in baseball but go ahead.

You've been a huge part of this team but

decisions have to be made that are best

for the team, I'm sure you can understand

that.

You're cutting me?

I'm really sorry.

I just bought a house here.

Well...

Well? That's all you have to say? My kids

just started at a new school, they made

friends.

That's--I'd leave them in school, you

don't want to take them out in the middle

What the hell are you doing?

Are you you or the player?

I'm me. You're talking about kids and

schools and you should've been out of the

room three minutes ago.

Shouldn't I tell them that they'll always

be a part of the A's family?

That makes me feel so good I'm thinking

of burning your house down with you in

it. These are professional baseball

players. You just do it. "Peter, I need

to let you go. Jack's office'll handle

the paperwork."

Listen, it's a team of probabilities, and

we're gonna need 162 games to tell that

tale in a nascent form. It's phase one,

we're evolving and we feel confident

where we're heading.

We're not scared.

3 out of 17 games. 3. We're getting

crucified in the press. What makes you

think this is gonna turn around?

Because I believe in what we're doing. I

believe the numbers. I believe the record

doesn't accurately reflect the team and

where we're going to be at the end of the

season. Peter and I feel very strongly

that we need to stick to the game plan,

and you can tell your partners to start

booking their tickets to the playoffs.

Billy, look, you've got guys who are

nearly crippled, who couldn't get hired

as an usher in a ballpark now playing on

the team. Give me something I can go back

to these guys with and feel like I have

the confidence that you're gonna turn

these things around.

With all due respect you asked me to

build a team with shoelaces and gum

wrappers and we've done it.

You haven't done it yet billy.

And it will pay off. Stick with us.

Suffer the blows. Listen, life with no

money means we're gonna have to suffer a

few embarrassments along the way, but we

are okay in the end.

Billy, there's a lot of money at stake

here.

Schott sits back at his desk.

89 INT. OAKLAND COLISEUM - DAY 89

I want Dye in right, Justice DH-ing, Pena

on the bench, Hatteberg at first and

anyone but Magnante first out of the pen.

You want Pena on the bench?

That's right. So that you can play

Hatteberg.

Hatte - as opposed to the guy who's going

to win Rookie of the Year.

No, Hatte - as opposed to the guy who

gets on base less. Pena getting voted

Rookie of the Year and the A's making the

playoffs are two entirely different--

Pena's not just the best first baseman on

the roster, he's the only first baseman

on the roster and the most valuable

member on this team.

Not according to, what do you call `em,

facts.

Listen to me--gets on base more than

Pena. 25% more.

His fielding doesn't matter.

It does matter and Pena only has one

error in 70 games.

Not only is that number statistically

insignificant but it's also subjective.

It measures what someone did against what

someone else thought they were supposed

to do.

we're not looking for.

He'll be fine, Ed.

Why do I get the feeling you're picking

I'm not picking your pocket, you're

G120 INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT G120

I'm not talking to people, I'm just

Don't worry. You don't believe me? Ask

Tara.

He's not (losing his job). Your dad is a

brilliant man. He's the best GM in

baseball.

But say that you did -- just saying --

would you have to move away?

No, honey. Absolutely not. And even if

I did, I'm not going anywhere. I told

you not to worry about me. People say a

lot of crazy things and they don't always

know what they're talking about. It's

just gossip. Like gossipers at school.

You can't always believe what you read.

Sometimes you need to scratch underneath

the surface and find who the authority

is.

And once you do find out who the

authorities are, ignore them at all

costs.

You can always ask your dad.

Everything's fine, honey. I'm not going

anywhere. The only way I would lose my

job is if someone was to give me a better

one. Don't worry about me, okay? Dad

knows what he's doing.

Peter is frozen. Neither Steve nor Billy are acting like

he's even in the room.

Silence.

A170 INT. TOWNCAR - DAY A170

170 EXT. FENWAY PARK - BOSTON - DAY 170

BILLY swinging hard at a pitch in the dirt.

BILLY and JOHN begin a stroll around the perimeter of

Fenway.

A171 INT. PRESS BOX - DAY A171

JOHN looks at BILLY a moment...

And we begin a slow push-in on BILLY... this is the first

person in baseball other than his assistant who doesn't

think he's crazy.

JOHN's taken a piece of paper out of his pocket and

slides it to BILLY --

176 INT. OAKLAND COLISEUM LOCKER ROOM - DAY 176

Pete just stares at him. Finally, Billy reaches into his

pocket, takes out the folded piece of paper and hands it

to Peter.

Peter looks at it...

Do I love the Red Sox?

I don't know. I've never heard you say

you did.

So why am I doing this?

You're not doing it for the money.

I'm not?

You're doing it for what the money says.

It says what it says to any player who

gets big money: that they're worth it.

The offer says that. The money itself is

redundant.

I made one personal decision based on

money in my life and I swore to never do

that again.

So you're not going to Boston?

I haven't decided.

It's all over the news that it's a done

deal.

Look at this place. What a dump.

I so wanted to win here.

I think you've already won, Billy.

No Pete, we lost.

You haven't given yourself time to get

over it, it's only been three days.

A177 OMITTED (MOVED TO K177) A177

B177 INT. VIDEO ROOM - DAY B177

JEREMY slips and stumbles to the ground.

JEREMY has been scrambling in the dirt to get safely back

to first base.

JEREMY's looking around the field now, looking at his own

dugout. We can't see what he sees but he's confused.

And JEREMY's face explodes into a smile. He slaps hands

with the first base coach and begins his trot around the

bases.

BILLY stares at this. He takes the remote and backs it

up a little so he can see Jeremy's face again.
