as another student painfully tattoo-scars his arm with

a swastika, using a knife and blue dye. Seeing the six-

year-old, Jaapie turns his attention to him and

addresses him in Afrikaans.

The other boys chorus in.

Jaapie bends down and grabs the six-year-old by the

shirt front, yanking him up.

Jaapie slaps the Boy across the mouth three times.

Blood flows from his mouth and nose. Jaapie dips his

finger in the blood and smears it across his new tattoo.

He holds up his bloodied fingers.

The chorus repeats.

The voices come back to him stronger.

17   HIS POV                                                       17

Jaapie flings his hand forward, victorious.

The Boy takes the opportunity to break loose. He rushes

Jaapie, whose arm is outstretched, putting him off

balance. The Boy catches him low, driving his head into

Jaapie's exposed stomach. Jaapie falls back and gets

the knife used for his tattooing right in his ass.

Jaapie Botha bellows like an enraged bull as he grabs

futiley for the embedded blade. His cohorts laugh,

thinking it tremendously funny, until Jaapie removes

the knife and turns with it, dripping his own blood, his

eyes murderous. The laughter dies. Jaapie's breath

comes hard.

A few boys protest.

But Botha is murderous, intent on revenge.

He waves the bloody knife in the air. Three boys grab

the six-year-old and drag him to where the chicken is

hanging. Two more boys throw a rope over the same

rafter. Others bind the struggling boy, trussing his

hands to his sides.

The boys who tied the rope now yank it over the rafter.

The six-year-old is hoisted up until he is eye-level with

the chicken.

glasses off and wipes the lenses deliberately.   After a

long moment he turns to face the class.

St. John rises, lecturing.

His eyes roam from face to face, fixing his point.

MORRIE, a bright-eyed kinetic, speaks up.

The boys bolt for the door.

PK approaches.

21   EXT. HALL                                                 21

Morrie consults the book.

He shoves Morrie playfully out the door and follows.

22   INT. LONG HALLWAY - CLOSEUP - PK AND MORRIE           22

Morrie and PK draw a deep breath. Together they push

open the double doors. Together they stride into a

floodlit, fully-packed sports arena and head down the

fan-lined aisle to the raised boxing ring in the center.

Schoolboys in their respective school blazers, Afrikaan

and English, yell, whistle and clap. PK and Morrie,

in FULL FRAME, reveal PK in a boxing robe with taped

hands, and Morrie with towel and bucket.

The stands explode with cheers.

A huge cheer goes up for JANNIE, muscular, bare-chested,

as he dances and shadowboxes for the crowd.

PK enters the ring. He stands, robe on, eyes intent on

Jannie. When the noise subsides the Announcer continues.

Now the English schoolboys cheer for their man, but PK

does not respond. He barely moves. He raises an arm in

bare acknowledgment. His attention stays focused across

the ring on his shadowboxing opponent. PK watches Jannie

dance closely when a low CHANTING begins from outside the

stadium -- African, tribal, mystical harmonies of black

voices building until the white voices inside the stadium

are stunned to silence. The song carries beautifully in

the night. For the first time PK's focus is broken, but

not like the others in the audience, who haven't a clue

as to what's happening. He has heard this before. This

is familiar.

PK ignores her anxiety.

Maria blushes.

All of a sudden there is a KNOCK on the door. Maria

starts. PK moves quickly behind the door as it opens to

TWO GIRLS.

They close the door.    Maria reinforces it with her body.

He is so direct she can only blush deeper.       Her response

is indirect but affirmative.

O.S., the outside door to the dorm opens.        A matron's

voice calls out.

PK opens her window and starts to climb out.

39   INT. MARAIS HOUSE                                      39

Unfortunately.

Why do you say that?

Because it's the whole tribal

idea that creates our problems

here in South Africa.

The problems of South Africa, my

boy, do not come from tribalism.

They come from counter-tribalism.

From people insisting that natural

laws which have been in place and

operating since God's creation,

should be tampered with. Does

the gazelle sleep with the lion?

Does the rhino graze with the

mouse? The separation of things

is not coincidental. Do you think

a Zulu wants to see his culture,

his sense of identity, replaced by

someone else's anymore than I do?

No, sir. But I don't think he

wants being a Zulu to mean he is

denied the same rights as

everyone else has.

Which is why civilization is

defined by the ability to live

under the rule of law. Laws

define rights.

But do they define justice?

Ah. Justice. The banner behind

which the English marched as they

gobbled up a quarter of the world?

Justice, my boy, is only relative

to who's in charge.

And how long they stay in charge

is only relative to how well they

dispense that justice...

... with all due respect.

Marais fixes PK with a stare.   PK's eyes meet his evenly,

unwavering. Maria enters.

Maria smiles at PK and exits.   He leads PK towards the

library.

men training. Sweat and smoke fill the air along with

the faint scent of blood. Fighters, both black and

white, train with each other. Morrie is amazed.

But PK has his mind on other things. His eyes fix on

an OLD MAN across the room standing by ringside.

PK leads Morrie across the gym. PK passes an African

fighter. He stops training when he sees PK. He turns

to another African fighter, glancing at PK. One by one

the blacks in the gym stop training to look at PK. PK

and Morrie approach the rheumy Old Man yelling at the

two fighters in the ring above him in a thick Polish-

Jewish accent.

He moves his creaky body back and forth to demonstrate.

Solly turns to the boys. A look of bemusement comes over

his face when he sees their blazers.

Solly rolls his eyes to heaven.

Just then, as if to underscore his point, one of the

fighters in the ring gets caught witha solid shot to the

jaw. He hits the canvas inches from where they are

standing. Solly, PK and Morrie all look at him, and then

at each other.

Morrie pulls out a wad of money and proffers it to Solly.

Solly pushes the money back.

Solly notices that every black fighter in the gym has

stopped working and is staring at PK.

The blacks go back to work.

PK heads towards the rear.      Solly turns to Morrie.

Solly breaks up laughing.

Solly gives him a long look.

Solly walks away.

Geel Piet assumes his submissive posture again.

He winks at PK and shuffles off.     A BELL SOUNDS.

Their turn comes to mount the Ferris wheel.         They get

into the seat and strap in.

The Ferris wheel starts to go up.

The Ferris wheel stops to let more people on.        Johannesburg

glitters beyond.

The wheel begins to move a little higher and then stops.

The wheel stops again at its highest point.

67   INT. PRISON BOXING ROOM                                   67

PK does his best to mimic.

Doc appears in the doorway.

Doc chuckles.

Doc takes a half-hearted swing.     PK bobs expertly.

Doc sets up and swings left, then right.     PK avoids

both swings.

PK points to a nearby bucket.

Geel Piet looks hesitantly from the man to the boy and

then begins.

Geel Piet fidgets.   He drops his head, speaking low.

The sound of a TRUNCHEON on METAL turns them to the door

where SERGEANT BORMANN, a side of beef with a sadist's

eyes, stands, truncheon in hand. He enters the room and

circles the trio.

He pokes Geel Piet with his truncheon.

Bormann swings his truncheon into the back of Geel Piet's

knees, buckling the little man to the floor.

He glares at Doc and PK.

PK exits with Morrie steaming behind. They head for

PK begins to disrobe.

At that moment a spotlight blinds them. A police car

comes up the alley, stopping in front of them. The

POLICE exit, threatening.

Maria is gripped by fear.     Morrie is cautious, unmoving.

Nguni reaches into his pocket.

The Police look at each other and share a laugh.

The Police laugh. Police #2, satisfied Nguni's papers

are in order, hands them back.

Nguni moves off, no semblance of the proud man in his

gait.

Lewis has heard enough.

His sarcasm is not lost on PK.   PK ignores it, opens his

folder, and begins to read.

Yes, kleine baas.

You are a good    faker, Geel Piet.

but you don't    think it's great at

all. It means     you lose your star

letter writer    and tobacco

importer.

No matter that, Professor. We

always manage here. What pains me

most is I lose my boxer.

I'll come back.

No, kleine baas. You leave this

damn place you don't come back

never.

Geel Piet, when a painter finishes

a work of art he doesn't lose it.

He sends it out in the world so

everyone can see the genius of his

creation. This is what you are

going to do. And to celebrate the

launch of such a work of art as

you have made our boxer here, I

have composed an entire concerto

-- 'The Concerto for the Southland'

-- which it is my intention to

play in concert for the prisoners

before I leave.

Not possible. The kommandant

never allow the people to have

such a thing.

He'll think it's a concert for him

and the brass. But we'll know,

ay? And the people will know.

He'll never let black be with

white here, Doc.

Geel Piet smiles as he lifts the watering pot to exit.   A

truncheon stops him. All turn to Sergeant Bormann.

He takes Geel Piet's hand.

He forces Geel Piet's hand closer and closer to a cactus

with long thorns.

He pushes Geel Piet's hands onto the cactus needle.        Geel

Piet does not cry out.

He lets go of Geel Piet's hand.     Geel Piet removes it

from the cactus, bloodied.

Geel Piet takes his watering can and goes.

Doc and PK glare at Bormann.    He smirks and walks away.

PK and Geel Piet appear before various tribal leaders,

talking, agreeing, shaking hands.

The Woman in the ring begins to chant.   The crowd picks

it up.

PK looks back at Maria who is a bit unnerved, as are

Morrie and Solly. He looks across at Mandoma whose face

is a mask looking straight ahead, betraying nothing. The

two men climb into the ring and stand in their corners.

The Old Woman shuffles over and peers into PK's face.

She mutters something inaudible, then turns to the crowd.

The crowd picks up the chant. She waves and the crowd

goes silent. Somewhere in the darkness a single voice

begins to sing "Nkosi Sikelel I Afrika" -- the African

national anthem.

The crowd picks it up. PK looks down to the front row

where Nguni sits courteously attending to Maria in a seat

of honor among the twelve men in suits.

The African national anthem finishes. The BELL RINGS

three times. The Old Woman is led from the ring. An

Indian Referee in all white enters the ring and waves

the two fighters forward.

PK and Mandoma touch gloves and go to their respective

corners.

Solly watches Mandoma dancing across the ring.

The BELL RINGS.

Mandoma comes charging across the ring and begins to fire

everything in his arsenal at PK, overwhelming him. PK

cannot get away from him and takes a series of devastat-

ing combinations which end in a left hook to PK's jaw.

PK drops like lead. The Referee starts counting. PK

shakes his head clear and rises at eight. The Referee

checks his gloves. There is a cut under his right eye.

Again, Mandoma comes charging hard. PK defends himself

as best he can, trying to counter. But Mandoma's offense

won't allow it. He beats on PK until the round ends. PK

sits down in his corner. Morrie works on his eye.

The BELL SOUNDS. PK is hardly off his stool when Mandoma

is on him, pummeling him. PK backpedals, bobs and

weaves. Mandoma's punches come fast and furious, each

one looking to end the fight. Mandoma gets PK against

the ropes and bangs away. PK covers up. Mandoma

punishes his arms and kidneys. PK swings back and es-

capes. Mandoma pursues him. He catches PK with a body

chop and then a chopping left. PK goes down again. The

Referee starts to count. The crowd is completely silent.

The BELL RINGS. PK returns to his corner, shaking his

head, trying to clear it. He flops onto his stool.

A CLAP of THUNDER cuts into their conversation.   Thick

roiling rain clouds appear suddenly.

Lightning splits the sky.   Rain begins to fall, pelting

the escarpment.

PK starts to move horizontally across the cliff face like

a spider on a wall. Doc follows. The rain becomes

torrential.

PK turns to look back at Doc.

over and gently lays the old man down. He removes his

boots and throws a blanket over him. PK blows out the

kerosene lamp and goes to exit. He is about to hang

their two rucksacks on two hooks by the door when Doc's

voice turns him.

Doc lays down.

Elijah nods.

PK holds his hand out for the cheesa stick. Elijah

lights the flare. He goes to hand it to PK. PK

notices Elijah's hands shaking. He sees the fear in

Elijah, released from his responsibility, retreats

quickly.

PK stands holding the flare, a little distracted by

Elijah's fear, wondering.

Elijah sounds the BLAST WHISTLE.

A MUFFLED BLAST comes from the other side of the hangup

deep in the stope. PK freezes, confused, and then a

SECOND BLAST goes off. The hangups starts to give. And

ANOTHER BLAST.

PK lights his own fuse and runs like hell over the bars

toward the tunnel.

The hangup, loosened by the explosions inside, gives

before PK's bomb ignites. The rock is crashing down.

PK races the rock. The tunnel is within sight.

The men yell for him to jump.

PK is about to leap when a rock hits the bar, bounces up,

and catches him in the stomach. He  loses his balance

and goes over the side as the hangup comes crashing down.

PK hits the wall of the lower funnel -- once, twice --

and then lands in the soft stuff -- the shale flake,

cushioning the steel doors below.

212   INT. HOSPITAL BED                                       212

Pk sits in the hospital bed, battered but otherwise in

good shape. Rasputin sits in a wheelchair by his bed-

side, his hands and chest bandaged, pondering the chess-

board between them.

Jocko enters.

He tosses a fat wad of cash on PK's bed.

Jocko grows uncomfortable.

Botha rises drunkenly.     PK backs up.

He throws back another drink and rushes PK with a roar.

PK sidesteps and heads for the door.

Botha gets there first and bolts it.

He rushes PK again.     Again PK sidesteps.

He swings at PK.     PK ducks.

At that moment the powder headache strikes. Botha

bellows, grabbing his head staggering backward.

PK runs for the door. As he reaches it a table slams

against it, thrown halfway across the room by a

powder-mad Botha.
