FADE IN:

INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK), HALLWAY - NIGHT

ANGLE ON apartment doorway. As it opens and an

enormously SWEET-FACED, ELDER WOMAN steps out, bungled up

against the cold -- turning back to call inside to the

unseen love of her long life.

And now she turns and faces the hallway... her sweetness

dissolves in a flash... replaced by repulsion and that

quickly she has reversed herself and re-entered her

apartment... closing the door as we consider her vacated.

POV - MELVIN UDALL

in the hallway... Well past 50... unliked, unloved,

unsettling. A huge pain in the ass to everyone he's ever

met. Right now all his considerable talent and strength

is totally focused on seducing a tiny dog into the

elevator door he holds open.

ON DOG

Sniffing at a particular spot on the hall carpeting.

Melvin lets the elevator door close and advances on the

mutt who has ignores him.

The dog lifts his leg at the precise moment Melvin lunges

and picks him up with a decisive heft -- so that dog

urine squirts the hall wall for a second or two. The DOG

sensing a kindred spirit starts to GROWL and BARK.

The dog takes a snap at Melvin, but the man is much

meaner and quicker than the dog -- he holds his snout

shut with his hand and reaches for the door of the

garbage chute.

And with that, he stuffs him in the garbage chute and

lets go. We hear a FADING SERIES of PLEADING "ANOOOOS"

from the DOG fade to nothingness... as another apartment

door opens emitting the loud sounds of a PARTY and SIMON

NYE, early 30s. Simon has been born and raised with

Gothic horror and it's strange that what that stew of

trauma has produced is a gifted, decent man.

INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK), HALLWAY - NIGHT

Frantic... he bolts into the hall... Melvin is just about

to enter his apartment.

He notices Melvin at the far end of the hall.

Melvin starts to walk back to his apartment door which is

directly opposite Simon's.

Simon looks O.S. -- and sees his black friend.

Simon has had it.

FRANK can only smile.

Simon, terminally non-confrontational, still finds

himself compelled to turn back toward Melvin.

Simon closes his door leaving Melvin alone in the

hallway.

INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT, BATHROOM - NIGHT

Melvin locks and unlocks and locks his door, counting to

five with each lock. He turns the lights quickly on and

off and on five times and makes a straight-line towards

his bathroom where he turns on the hot water and opens

the medicine chest.

INT. MEDICINE CHEST

Scores of neatly stacked Neutrogena soaps. He unwraps

one -- begins to wash -- discards it -- goes through the

process two more times.

INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT, ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT

A group of PARTY GOERS enters -- followed by a HANDYMAN

holding Verdell who looks and finds:

SIMON

who looks up -- lights up -- and tears up as he moves

quickly toward the group and his dog.

As Simon goes past him to take the dog from the

Handyman... JACKIE, Frank's junior partner, barking a

laugh at the Party Goer -- VERDELL BARKING some love. As

the others greet Simon, Jackie directs the group inside.

Jackie lingers, looking on affectionately as Simon picks

some awful, sticky gunk from the dog's body... he puts

Verdell down to reach for his wallet -- the tiny DOG YAPS

in protest.

The DOG YAPS "no." Simon, delighted, picks him up again.

Simon reacts -- then notices the Handyman, tongue in

cheek, trying to suppress his amusement.

He stares out... Frank frustrated following.

INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - OFFICE - NIGHT

Quiet -- safe -- just Melvin's voice reading aloud as he

writes.

He barely reacts as we hear a LOUD KNOCKING at he reads.

But Melvin's into it. His fingers flying as he reads.

More KNOCKING.

He almost has the rest of the sentence -- the meaning of

love -- but the knocking throws him.

He burst from his chair.

INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - HALLWAY - NIGHT

As Simon hears MELVIN through the door and takes a step

back. Melvin throws open the door. He looks demonic.

Frank signals encouragement as Melvin opens the door.

Melvin walks back into the apartment and is about to

close the door when Simon has another burst of bravery.

Melvin enters his apartment and slams the door shut.

Frank smiles affectionately. Simon turns serious.

Frank waits till Simon EXITS SCENE and then knocks loudly

on Melvin's door. There is a sharp change in his demeanor.

Frank waits patiently as Melvin jerks his door back open.

Frank immediately grabs Melvin by his shirt and jerks him

forward...  Melvin is scared. Operating on survival mode.

He tosses Melvin back and walks out. Melvin straightens

his shirt as he steps out into the hall. Frank smiles as

he re-enters the other apartment. Melvin appears

impressed.

EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET NEAR CAROL'S RESTAURANT - DAY

A crowded and dirty street and here comes Melvin. His

walk is brisk -- an animal wanting to pass through the

danger without giving off the scent of its mounting fear.

At times he places his palms together and extends his

arms cutting a path through people. We will be very

pointed in the fact that he avoids stepping on cracks.

CLOSER ON MELVIN

His eyes focused on the terrain.

INT. CAROL'S RESTAURANT - DAY

ANGLE ON WAITRESS

CAROL CONNELLY talks with another MOTHER -- a customer.

You would not guess it, but her working hours tend to be

the most carefree time of the day. She is telling a

story about her son for the umpteenth time.

The Mother nods too sympathetically that she does, but

Carol interrupts her.

Melvin enters and moves past several empty tables to a

table towards the back and is obviously surprised to find

a MAN and WOMAN sitting at the table.

They turn away -- Melvin walks a few paces to the

waitress station where two waitresses, LISA and CAROL,

are talking.

She puts two hands lightly on his waist to move him out

of the way. He gulps at the contact (since no one else

ever touches him) but covers his self-consciousness.

Melvin intentionally moves a step in her path, with

stealth, so that she must touch him again to get him out

of the way...

She barks a mirthless though hearty laugh. If we could

read Melvin which we can't, we'd see him unsettled by the

date talk. To Carol he is as harmless as furniture.

The other WAITRESSES and the SHORT ORDER COOK all go

"awww."

The two waitresses signal their protests.

Melvin walks back into the restaurant proper...  he hangs

near their table...  his discomfort builds in this limbo...

then:

The Woman starts to protest.

Melvin sits down at the table -- and takes from his

pocket a plastic eating utensil set wrapped and sealed.

As he opens his utensils.

There is in Carol's attitude toward Melvin some

ingredient of self-satisfaction -- that she is the only

one in the place who can handle him. She starts to clear

the table.

ON CAROL

Stunned. Some crazy street-freak has slipped under her

perfect guard and momentarily devastated her. Melvin

senses that he's gone way too far. He wipes his knife.

A beat and then Melvin nods, hardly breathing -- backing

down.

She walks away. Melvin watches her, biting his lower

lip. He takes some napkins and cleans the table himself.

INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

She is underneath a YOUNGER, cuter MAN on the living room

sofa. He is expertly into foreplay. She begins to make

noises as she responds...  each time startling herself

with her own noise and trying to reign it in.

She's two women here -- one speeding the pleasure highway

-- the other -- functional mom so blown away by the

emergence of this sexy self that she laughs. The Young

Man stops and looks at her.

His eyes try to burn into hers... She is getting excited

but doesn't know how to play it...  He pushes one of the

fingers of the hand caressing her face toward her

mouth...  She closes her teeth, his fingers attempt

opening her mouth. She stops him.

And so with earnestness and caring, she has transformed

the sex into something more intimate -- and, talk about

egg in your beer, hotter. Things are getting wild when

we hear from the distance a child, SPENCER, CALLING and

COUGHING.

Carol pulls her head away -- as Spencer's call continues.

INT. HALLWAY/BEVERLY'S ROOM - NIGHT

Pulling herself together she goes off down the hallway...

she ducks her head into the first bedroom where her

mother, BEVERLY, is listening to music on headphones...

she takes them off when she sees Carol, then hears the

cough.

Carol now goes into her son's room.

INT. SPENCER'S ROOM - NIGHT

The room is a monument to horrible, sleepless nights...

two drugstore de-humidifying filters, a nebulizer

(breathing contraption) a waste basket...  a night stand

filled with medicine, a blood pressure kit...  along with

some stacks of seven-year-old toys and a small TV wedged

into the tiny space.

Carol feels his head...  that's okay. Then he coughs --

trying to suppress it...  then a bigger cough...  they each

know what that signals...  She brings up a waste basket as

he throws up...  she comforts him. He apologizes. She

loves him.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

As she re-enters. He is taking a cigarette from a pack.

He palms the cigarette -- resumes making out -- his hand

squeezes her breast -- then he stops and looks at his

hand. She looks down and sees a bit of throw-up he

picked up while feeling her and then notices him looking

at her with extreme distaste...  She barks a laugh to

cover her embarrassment but speaks the truth.

She crosses to the kitchen for a dishtowel. Tries to make

light.

She notices his demeanor -- how he avoids looking at her --

how uncomfortable he is.

She brightens.

She deflates as he moves past her.

EXT. HOLLAND TUNNEL - NIGHT

A cold night in hell. Three young men bullshit near the

approach to the tunnel. Their names are VINCENT, EVAN

and DOUG, who is the oldest at 28. Vincent is dopey and

the most likeable of the gritty little trio.

They all focus on a black BMW as it slows and stops in

front of them. CARL checks them out carefully through

the front window. He is talking on the speaker phone.

Seeing the hustlers:

Carl beckons to Vincent who joins him, trying to conceal

his pride at winning this lowest end of beauty contest.

INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - DAY

There is a KNOCK at the door -- Simon crosses to answer.

He is more relaxed than we've seen him -- a man at peace

humming to his favorite music, talking to his dog who

scratches at the door. Simon opens the door to Vincent.

He leads the way back toward the studio -- chatting away

-- unaware that Vincent is disrobing as he follows him

and eyeing the expensive apartment.

And he turns and sees the naked model.

Vincent moves back to retrieve his clothes.

INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - STUDIO (MINUTES LATER)

Vincent is striking blatantly sexual poses to the

increasingly uneasy Simon.

Vincent has instinctively put Simon on the defensive. He

tries not to show it.

Vincent's slack-jawed expression changes. He feels an

intellectual tingle to be having this conversation.

There's a joy in him at this moment -- a bit of purity.

Vincent does so -- hums a bit of "Satisfaction" to

celebrate.

INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

Carol and LESLIE, another waitress, are waiting for their

order at the cappuccino bar. Leslie is telling the story

of the traumatic audition which may have turned her life.

Carol is rapt.

As they pass Melvin she does not break stride, nor give

him notice. Though she is aware of him -- resentfully so

-- hard not to be since he is giving a moment to moment

commentary on her every action.

Melvin stops -- she passes behind him to deliver an

uncharacteristic rabbit punch.

Melvin just looks at her.

She exits.

INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - STUDIO - DAY (SEVERAL WEEKS LATER)

The greenhouse studio is a busy sanctuary, as Simon puts

the finishing touches on his painting of Vincent. A beat

and then a strange figure crosses between the CAMERA and

the scene -- gone before we can examine him further.

Vincent quickly and expertly picks a CD to meet his

immediate needs and puts it on -- dying a little at every

second of silence during the transition... then LOUD

MUSIC PLAYS...  Vincent even GOOSING the VOLUME. Simon

does a take -- he gestures Vincent to take it down --

which Vincent does.

ANGLE - APARTMENT

where it is not clear that a robbery is in progress --

Vincent's two friends from the street sweeping all

objects into large sacks -- one of them, Doug, pauses

to look past the terrace to the studio.

INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT, STUDIO - DAY

MUSIC PLAYS -- Simon cleaning up his stuff.

Simon sneaks a look at the canvas from another

perspective...  he focuses -- then the smallest shy nod

of self-approval -- he's finished. Vincent is desperate

to distract.

CLOSE ON dog as Verdell awakens, stretches and pricks his

ears. He moves quickly to the closed door and starts to

frantically scratch, attracting Simon's attention.

As Simon keeps walking...  Vincent shoots over to the

canvas.

Simon opens the door and Verdell shoots out like a

bullet. Vincent pauses before the painting and is thrown

to see his humanity captured -- to be "immortalized."

INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Doug and Evan are nearly to the front door as VERDELL

stops them with a vicious GROWL and BARK.

Simon is distracted -- looking down at his pet so that he

continues to walk toward Doug and Evan, not noticing

them -- Vincent, terribly afraid, appears behind Simon.

He instantly stops. Shocked. Frozen. His eyes on the

stranger, Doug, looking at him. Now Vincent comes in.

Doug greets him.

Simon turns to Vincent.

Now Evan appears holding a brass hat rack.

And he uses the hat rack first as a spear, then as a

club, as the brief savage attack begins.

ON VERDELL

as he starts to go toward Simon and then scurries back in

fear. The three attackers leave. Now silence. A single

BARK from VERDELL.

INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - HALLWAY - DUSK

A mass of OFFICIAL PEOPLE clutter the hall as a gurney is

whisked down to the elevator. It's impossible to tell if

Simon is awake or dead. Melvin is standing against the

wall near his door a cop, RAY, interviewing him.

INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - HALLWAY -

ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT

Frank standing upset, anxious, holding a dog bowl, a

leash and VERDELL, who is more upset making pathetic

little CRYING SOUNDS.

As we FOCUS BRIEFLY ON Verdell...  Frank is talking to the

Sweet-Faced Woman.

A short laugh makes us realize that Melvin has witnessed

and enjoyed Frank's hostile mutterings...

VERDELL starts WHIMPERING as a pissed Frank approaches

his mugger:

Frank pushes open the door to Melvin's apartment and

places Verdell inside.

INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

MUSIC IN: as Frank pulls the door partially closed to

block Verdell's escape.

The music represents Verdell's state of mind -- trapped

in the apartment of the man who tried to kill him. We

STAY with the dog during the O.S. dialogue: As his head

turns in panic we see his various POVs as the dialogue

continues O.S.

INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Melvin enters -- the dog cowers in the shadows. Now

Melvin sees him.

VERDELL STOPS -- gives Melvin wide berth -- slinking

along the far wall. Melvin finds Verdell's fear of him a

bit calming.

Melvin exits. Verdell is in a major funk.

INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Melvin breaks two eggs over a large pile of prime chopped

meat, sticks raw pieces of bacon into it and exits the

room.

INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Verdell cringing as his new master approaches -- MUSIC

CONTINUES ominously. Melvin sets the bowl down and

exits...  Verdell breathes excitedly though looking

alternately in all directions... his recent past making

him suspect this feast is a trick. He sniffs

cautiously -- then dives in -- GOTHIC MUSIC CHANGING on a

dime TO SCORE his RAPTURE... from O.S. we hear the sound

of RUNNING WATER as steam escapes the bathroom -- then

MUSIC OUT -- as Melvin returns...  ignoring Verdell he

sits at the piano and his one key repeatedly. It's odd.

Verdell shifts his body so he is eating from the bowl

with his tail to Melvin. Then Melvin begins to play and

sing Monty Python's "Always Look On The Bright Side Of

Life," with its cheerful whistle refrain. Verdell looks

over with surprise and pleasure. But just as mood lifts

and warmth threatens, Melvin stops abruptly, turns out

the lights and exits.

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

Frank on the phone.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

As Jackie enters.

He turns toward her. Much of his body -- taped -- his

painting hand wrapped. Simon's face is something of a

horror. Swollen, one savage discolored cut. We are into

yuccchhh...  The sight is a jolt. Jackie breaks into

tears...  sobs, actually.

They share a helpless half-laugh -- then Frank appears in

the doorway.

She starts to hand him a large mirror from her purse --

then thinks better of it.

But he holds out his hand and she gives him the mirror --

he starts to look -- then thinks better of it.

Simon holds the mirror poised for a moment of discovery,

then he takes a breath -- like someone about to dive

underwater. First a small, mumbled pep talk to himself.

He quickly brings his hand up and looks at the mirror...

he is startled -- the bottom drops out -- leaving him

awed by his misfortune.

EXT. CAROL'S RESTAURANT - DAY

AN ESTABLISHING SHOT FEATURING Verdell tied up in front.

INT. CAROL'S RESTAURANT - DAY

Melvin finishing a plate of eggs, bacon and sausage with

his plastic knife and fork. Carol looks totally beat as

she sets down a cup of coffee. Melvin is craning

periodically to keep an eye of his dog.

He changes tables for the first time ever so that he can

keep an eye on Verdell. Carol is amazed.

Carol looks at him.

He indicates the bags under her eyes by tapping his own.

She reaches for the plate of uneaten bacon -- he goes

nuts.

She is jolted by the insensitivity of his interruption,

but he doesn't notice, turning, almost chatty.

Melvin nods -- a bit frustrated about not being able to

finish his dog story. He pockets the remaining bacon.

EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY

As Melvin walks Verdell back home, we notice, perhaps a

beat before Melvin, a remarkably event. Verdell is

avoiding the cracks in the sidewalk.

Melvin slows -- observes the dog mirroring his behavior.

ON VERDELL

again carefully placing his paws to avoid a crack in the

sidewalk. Melvin laughs out loud -- puts on plastic

gloves hurriedly so he can lift the dog to eye level.

ANOTHER ANGLE

INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Melvin whaling away at his computer, reading to himself

with great satisfaction as he goes.

Verdell sits at his chair, fascinated by the speed of his

master's fingers on the keyboard. He reads his writing

aloud to the dog.

Exhilarated by his own words, he shuts down the machine...

He exits.

As the dog goes shooting off to the kitchen we leave our

couple's play time for...

INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM/LIVING ROOM/HALLWAY - DAY

As the rookie invalid awakens in precisely the same foul

mood he'd had on falling asleep. In the living room, the

maid, NORA, is talking with Jackie -- we catch only a few

words as they review Simon's mounting pile of bills and

talk of how long Nora can stay on.

INT. NEW YORK APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY

Frank knocking on Melvin's door. He opens it.

As he looks over at the dog, Verdell trots over and,

without realizing it, Melvin smiles at him to Frank's

surprise.

Frank exits.

INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Melvin sits -- Verdell looks up at him. Melvin walks to

the door. He turns the lock... then checks that they are

locked...  checks again to make sure he turned them in the

correct direction...  turns from the door...  then back to

check once more. And again...  and again...  anguished,

until now he breaks briefly, the dog looking on.

INT. NEW YORK BUILDING - MELVIN'S APARTMENT - HALLWAY - DAY

Melvin opens the door -- looks at the scarred Simon in a

wheelchair and shudders...

A beat of silence as Melvin thinks whether to comply.

ON VERDELL

Totally weirded out...  hiding behind Melvin...  now Melvin

shifts and Simon and Verdell see each other...  Simon

smiles at the dog...  he is emotionally caught up in the

reunion.

Verdell isn't eager.

ON SIMON

The first gnawing pains of rejection.

INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - DAY

Simon pats his leg -- trying unsuccessfully to get

Verdell to approach him. Instead the dog goes to the

door and scratches at it. Jackie starts to pick the dog

up.

INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

MELVIN'S POV

Verdell's towel on the floor -- near his bowl.

BACK TO SCENE

Melvin's lips compress... he sits on the piano bench and

hits a few keys...  looks at Verdell's empty spot again...

there are those who "get the joke" -- Melvin is clearly

one -- he laughs suddenly and helplessly even as he feels

the panic rise in him...

...  all his painstaking success in keeping the lid on and

now it threatens to blow for a reason he articulates.

It's hilarious. But now the humor detours. An actual

sob is choked back...  he gets up -- following a definite

pattern across the room. He is conducting a small but

highest-stakes fight for survival. Momentarily a scared,

beaten middle-aged man -- he races out the door.

EXT. NYC STREETS - DAY

Melvin charging as fast as crack checks allow and then

turning into a building with a copper sign reading

"Grammercy Park Psychiatric Group."

INT. PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - DAY

Melvin bursts in on the psychiatrist and emits one word.

The Doctor moves into the hallway, forcing Melvin to

follow.

Melvin shakes his head -- as if things weren't bad enough

he must go through a careful exercise noting every new

element before he's at all comfortable... as he studies

each object. The Doctor is professionally intrigued

despite himself.

INT. PSYCHIATRISTS' WAITING ROOM - DAY

More PATIENTS in the almost-crowded waiting room. Melvin

passes through -- visibly drawn and upset. He stops.

Eyes on them. Then:

They look stricken. He exits.

INT. CAROL'S RESTAURANT - DAY

As he walks to his booth and sits down. Enormous relief.

CHERYL, a heavy-set waitress, reluctantly moves to his

table -- unseen by Melvin as he takes out his utensils

and arranges them. In a corner booth, four big TRANSIT

AUTHORITY POLICE are having a meal together. Cheryl

looks at his utensils.

The MANAGER comes over, gesturing to the table of police

that he can handle it. All attention is on Melvin.

Melvin looks at the police, sizes up the hopeless

situation and rises.

He walks toward the door as Cheryl and all the other

employees applaud his defeat. As he passes a BUSBOY near

the door he hands him 20 dollars.

EXT. BROOKLYN STREET - DAY

An uncomfortable Melvin sitting in the back of a taxi.

MELVIN'S POV

A neighborhood in Brooklyn -- a community. Melvin, ever

the shark observer, looks from the cab to see slices of

community life -- MEN in front of a bar, PARENTS giving

their CHILD a ride on a mechanical horse outside a local

store -- two YOUNG WOMEN discuss dating.

EXT. CAROL'S BUILDING - DAY

As he exits -- RINGS the BELL and is BUZZED in.

INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DOOR/HALLWAY - DAY

Carol opens the door just as he arrives on her landing.

She holds a container of ice, washclothes and a

thermometer.

Melvin ignores the question, instead answering a charge

he had imagined she might make...

Even saying the sentence, "My son is sick" pushes some

emotions toward the surface which are wasted on the crazy

man at her threshold.

She crosses to the sink to dump the ice. Melvin takes a

step inside. Spencer, seven and looking ill, walks into

the room.

Spencer just stares at him.

Carol eyes Melvin with disgust and disbelief then

emphatically gestures him to "clear out." Melvin backs

out the door.

She closes the door in his face, then walks to her son

and leads him back to his room.

INT. SPENCER'S ROOM

CAMERA MOVES TOWARD mother and son sitting on the edge of

Spencer's bed. She holds a digital thermometer to his

ear. They both count down the seconds.

EXT. BROOKLYN SIDEWALK - ANGLE ON CAROL - DAY

As Carol carries her young son through a class of

uniformed KIDS from a Catholic elementary school. She

spots Melvin about to enter a cab.

The school kids pick up the chant in unison.

He turns to face them.

They immediately obey as Carol approaches him.

Melvin is thrown...  he pauses a beat...  then holds the

rear door open as Carol hustles the kid inside. The

maneuver puts the beet red, sweating Spencer at his face.

INT. BROOKLYN CAB - DAY

As they settle in and drive off.

EXT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY

As Carol enters the hospital.

Melvin follows behind her as she carries her son...

INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - DAY

Verdell lies just inside the front door whimpering for

Melvin. Jackie sits across from Simon's wheel chair...

she has some index cards in her laps which she

occasionally consults and shuffles.

Simon forces his attention to Jackie.

ANGLE ON VERDELL

as their conversation continues -- the dog is distressed.

Verdell walks out on the terrace and looks off. He turns

for:

Verdell hides behind a chair.

As Jackie looks at him then thumbs for a card.

Verdell has come near him -- he reaches out a hand to pet

the dog and the dog ducks.

INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - DAY

He is trying to write. He can't. His world has been upset.

He walks away from his work -- a highly unusual act. He

is distressed -- and then an idea and he exits.

INT. PUBLISHER'S OFFICE - DAY

We are looking at ZOE, the receptionist. She is listening

with interest to an O.S. conversation while answering

phone calls, "Premier Publishing."

They appear now -- the woman tall, attractive, etc. She

pauses at the elevator.

She nods, pissed, waves and leaves. As Melvin waits, Zoe

summons her moxie.

As he hits the button, wipes his fingers, hits the button

etc.

The fan is jolted as the elevator doors open and close.

EXT. STREET NEAR CAROL'S BUILDING - DAY

A depleted, exhausted Carol approaches her home. She is

suddenly wary -- SOUND DIALED DOWN -- as we MOVE CLOSER.

CAROL'S POV

A car at the curb with "MD" license plate.

BACK TO SCENE

As Carol breaks into a run.

INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT BUILDING, STAIRWAY/HALLWAY - DAY

As she bounds the stairs, comes to her apartment door and

jiggles with the keys, a strange prescient whimpering

sound coming from her. As she enters the apartment.

The worst confirmed, she moves down the narrow hallway,

her innards squirting the same chemicals that drives elk

on opening day of the hunting season.

INT. SPENCER'S ROOM - DAY

And so she does. Wow does she... and gives us some

notion of the size of her fear demon and the strength it

takes to subdue it as Dr. Bettes keeps reassuring her and

she keeps nodding... finally a deep breath as Spencer

enters from the bathroom. All at hyper speed now.

Salvation as farce.

Beverly, Carol's mother, enters the room. She is ebullient

which, if life allowed, would be her natural state.

ON Dr. Bettes' reaction her mother adds a saving grace.

A NURSE enters.

Carol and her mother exchange a look of incredulity.

MOVING SHOT

As we approach the doctor and Carol seated across from

each other at a small table... soft voices...  relaxation.

Bettes is examining medicine bottles.

Carol look at her mother -- they share a laugh. Beverly

has a hard time stopping.

She starts towards Spencer's room.

She pats his head...  Then embraces him with fierce

intimacy.

She takes this as a blow to the heart, stomach and groin.

INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - DAY

Simon practices walking using his cane. A tearstained

Nora hugs him good-bye.

She kisses him and starts for the door and suddenly a

sharp intake of breath -- she's forgotten something.

Simon hadn't thought of this either.

INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - HALLWAY - DAY

Nora holding her things, knocks on Melvin's door. Melvin

opens the door. Nora is still sniffling. He misinterprets.

He closes the door in her face. She stands there...

thrown by the abruptness -- then lifts the two paper

shopping bags holding her things -- walks back toward the

elevator -- pausing briefly outside Simon's door -- then

continues on her way.

INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT

The doctor gone, mother and daughter arguing.

EXT. NEW YORK APARTMENT - ESTABLISHING - DAY

INT. SIMON'S APARTMENT - DAY

Shades drawn. Simon is a wheelchair...  the PHONE RINGS.

He goes to answer... the phone across the bed so that

reaching for the phone is a brief but difficult

struggle... he grunts with pain, hope and anxiety as he

answers.

He runs a hand across his scarred and still bloated and

beaten face...

He picks up an index card from his night stand and takes

the leap -- reading the text he prepared in advance.

It's very quiet.

LONG SHOT - SIMON

A lonely figure -- who now holds his good hand up to his

face and appears on the verge of enormous emotional

release -- CAMERA MOVES TOWARD him as if to rendezvous

with the moment of catharsis...

...  but Simon is denied even this small luxury as the

CAMERA ABRUPTLY ADJUSTS just as he begins sobbing to

focus on the door opening and Melvin and Verdell entering

the room.

Simon wheels away from Melvin.

Melvin pauses -- Simon weeping... Verdell looks at Simon

with concern. Melvin is thrown. Moved?

Simon swings his arm and cast at Melvin -- the sudden

attack jolts Melvin but not as much as what follows.

Melvin has made for the door...  Simon blocks him.

As Simon works to stop crying, Melvin is weird with

discomfort.

Simon looks up, his mood turning on a dime -- he's

rapt...  Melvin comes and stands by his wheelchair.

Verdell goes like a bullet to Melvin... who is totally

surprised and staggered by the implications. True love

and such.

He exits...  looking apologetically at Simon in stoic

ruin.

INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Carol in bed on the pullout sofa...  She is in turmoil...

there is THUNDER, but no rain. She walks to the kitchen.

She is trembling as she drinks a glass of water and exits.

INT. BEVERLY BEDROOM - NIGHT

The room is on an air shaft and this is where Carol

shares a closet with her mother, who is now asleep.

Carol quietly extracts a dress from the closet, leaving

her nightgown on the floor. There is something sexy

here, the woman in Carol churning. She plops on a summer

dress -- no time for underwear.

EXT. BROOKLYN STREET - NIGHT

Carol seeing a bus and dashing after it.

EXT. MANHATTAN BRIDGE - TWO AM

Carol crossing to Manhattan. She looks as if she's on

her way to some final exam where she has no notion of the

subject.

EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - NEAR MELVIN'S BUILDING -

NIGHT (RAIN)

Hot summer night as she gets off the bus and now the

rains come...  We are in a familiar neighborhood.

ANGLE ON MELVIN AND SIMON'S APARTMENT HOUSE

As Carol consults the slip of paper with the address on

it.

INT. NEW YORK APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT (RAIN)

As she enters building and realizes it's not just that

she's wet -- the thin summer dress is a winner in any wet

T-shirt contest...  the fabric clinging to her breasts,

like the old movie poster of The Deep.

INT. NEW YORK APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT

As Carol passes Simon's door...  stands in front of

Melvin's apartment -- twists herself to ease nervousness

and knocks on the door...  then RINGS the BELL. Finally

Carol hears MUFFLED THROAT CLEARING on the other side

of the door.

As we hear him unlock the door, Carol looks at her

breasts and gasps. She grasps the fabric and holds it

straight out just as Melvin opens the door. His hair is

static city, standing on end as he periodically gives it

self-conscious pats.

She pauses -- the beginning of an extraordinarily long

silence. Finally.

Melvin's reaction? Well, he'll never get credit for the

brief but intense inner struggle -- the struggle not to

scream --

-- not to cry -- to process the sudden and stunning hurt

during his half turn away from her -- and then answer

hoarsely.

Carol is amused, surprised...  maybe, in some small way

ever taken by his style...  but top priority is clarity.

Her mission completed -- she turns.

INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

It's a 3:22 a.m. as the two digital clocks on Melvin's

night stand tell us...  He gets up -- the first time we've

seen his waking routine -- taps one foot on the floor

twice -- then the other foot -- two more taps and his

body angles from the bed in a deliberate way.

He is having anxiety. He sits at the piano and plays

very briefly...  Stops -- wipes some sweat from his

forehead...  Walks to his computer room -- turns the light

on and then quickly off...  Walks to his refrigerator...

INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT, KITCHEN, INSIDE REFRIGERATOR -

NIGHT

As he grabs a cardboard take-out box...

INT. NEW YORK APT. BUILDING - HALLWAY/SIMON'S APT.

He knocks of Simon's door...  It opens quickly.

SIMON'S APARTMENT

Simon walks painfully back to a chair.

Melvin sits and moans -- the dog sitting near him.

He feels a touch of community and not knowing where to

take it from here.

He rises and makes an awkward exit.

He exits -- Simon puzzled and concerned.

INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Carol seated working on a letter... She is trying to

express her gratitude... An enormous sheaf of completed

pages sit next to her... She is so involved she doesn't

even look up as a young man, SEAN, knocks on the door and

is let in by Beverly.

They exchange greetings and move inside where we faintly

hear Spencer greeting him... We MOVE IN and read over

Carol's shoulder -- "I'm sorry to have gotten sloppy and

emotional in this letter, but it would have been on my

conscionce (sic) forever if I didn't tell you how

gratefull (sic)... "

Carol breathes heavily -- gets control, stopping herself

on the brink of crying.

Carol is amazed at herself... that she might not be able

to stem the flow... wide-eyed with apprehension, she

looks at her mother, who, in return, only nods permission

for Carol to let it go. A last defiant snort from Carol

-- and then she is overwhelmed. The headline comes first.

Slumped, fought out -- Carol gets out one last, naked

husky voiced question.

A beat, then.

INT. CAROL'S APT, SPENCER'S ROOM, HALLWAY - NIGHT

As they enter, still wiping away the effects of their

cry.

She kisses Spencer -- almost getting involved in what

he's doing -- then sees her mother waiting.

Spencer nods -- involved with Sean. CAMERA FOLLOWS Carol

as she exits the apartment -- her mother leading.

Halfway down the stairs, she stops and reverses herself,

going back to the apartment which she re-enters -- then

to her son to ask:

Carol exits.

EXT. STREET - NEAR CAROL'S BLDG. (MOVING) - DAY

Beverly and Carol walking past the store windows. A

simple and unprecedented experience in their recent

lives.

Carol nods tightly... then they wrap arms around each

other and continue walking, turning into a corner bar.

INT. CAROL'S RESTAURANT - CLOSE ON CAROL - DAY

As Carol stands nervously while Lisa finishes reading her

14-page letter. In the b.g. Melvin and Frank are seated

at the same table and in earnest conversation. Lisa

keeps flicking away tears -- a few drops on the pages.

Lisa brushes the paper -- finishes and embraces Carol.

ON MELVIN & FRANK

She self-consciously hands him with the thick envelope.

He hands it back to her deliberately. She takes it and

walks back to the service area where, embarrassed,

confused, and messed with -- she tosses the note.

After Carol leaves...

Melvin looks up -- wary -- his brain sends a disturbing

message.

Carol enters scene.

She exits. Frank prepares to depart.

Frank stumbles back... self-satisfied, he relaxes.

Frank adjusts and exits... Carol approaches calling a

"good-bye" to him.

She offers him the note.

Melvin wants to disappear but Carol is getting into it --

emotionally moved by her own words.

And finally Carol notes Melvin's mood and pauses.

She looks at him for a very strange, long beat.

INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - BEVERLY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Carol takes an old weekend case down from the top shelf

of the closet.

She holds up a dress -- a pretty one... then decides it's

too pretty and puts it back... Now she looks in another

drawer and pauses as if she ponders one of the mysteries

of the ages. She hesitates then talks to herself.

INSERT -- UNDERWEAR DRAWER

Her best underwear neatly stacked alongside her everyday

"girl Jockies." She fingers the good stuff -- puts it

back -- then the everyday -- hesitates.

As she exits the room --

INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT

As she picks up the phone.

INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Melvin is in his bedroom -- everything he's taking neatly

stacked on the bed waiting to be packed (he is taking a

camera). He has a list of what he needs. All items --

underwear, socks, etc... with four checks next to each

one and still he -- checks each stack on the bed and adds

another check. The PHONE RINGS. This is an amazing

development. He has almost no recent experience with

receiving a nighttime phone call. He makes a little

comment to himself as he moves.

He stops -- briefly trying to remember where the phone is

-- and then, remembering, crosses and picks it up but

before bringing it to his mouth nervously clears his

throat.

ON CAROL

As she hears his throat being cleared. It is not a

pretty sound. (The following conversation is INTERCUT.)

Melvin visibly relaxes.

INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - BEVERLY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Beverly looks up expectantly as her daughter enters.

EXT. CAROL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Beverly and Spencer wait with her. The bus approaches.

She kisses them.

As she boards the bus.

The bus driver closes the doors on her -- she shoves them

open.

The bus pulls out. He runs after the bus -- waving at

his mother who grows concerned that he might be taxing

himself.

INT. VETERINARIAN'S WAITING ROOM - DAY

A female VETERINARIAN in surgical scrubs holds Verdell as

Melvin finishes filling out some forms.

On opposite sides of the waiting room, a very large black

dog and a tiny Chihuahua sit patiently with their owners.

EXT. BUS STOP NEAR APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - DAY

Carol disembarks.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - DAY

As she walks and turns a corner.

CLOSE ON CAROL

The shot of the prisoner taking the walk toward the death

chamber. But the prisoner -- has grit -- her knees do

not buckle. She does not whimper. No prison "screws"

will have to support her weight. Still, the prospect

couldn't be grimmer.

CAROL'S POV

Melvin next to a spiffy convertible. Top down. Trunk open.

CLOSER ON MELVIN

He is wearing driving gloves and turns to witness the

tussle Frank and Simon are having just inside the

building.

Frank starts to leave -- Simon stops him. They embrace.

As Frank moves off Melvin sees Carol and his demeanor

changes... that quickly there is a shyness.

Carol puts her bag in the car.

Carol steps into the back. Melvin disappointed that he's

not sitting next to Carol... Carol is wedged in the small

back seat. She struggles to get her feet in.

He reaches for the latch between his legs and slides his

seat and, with some effort,  wrenches it forward giving

Carol more room and putting his right against the wheel.

She is startled by the gesture.

And off they go. Simon and Carol stunned by the manners.

EXT. 12TH STREET

Turning onto Fifth.

CAMERA FOLLOWS as Melvin goes to a rack of CDs -- all

carefully labelled. He selects and begins to play the

one marked "ICEBREAKER." It is a song which we clearly

and quickly judge as off the circumstances -- a quick

burst of "Y.M.C.A." Melvin STOPS the MUSIC and chuckles.

He goes for another CD labelled "FOR USE TO REP THINGS

UP."

The car turns onto Seventh as we hear BEAUTIFULLY

SELECTED MUSIC.

And, as the MUSIC PLAYS, Simon looks out.

EXT. ROAD - DAY

The three of them... Carol chattering away.

EXT. ROAD - DAY

A short time later. Carol is now driving.

Simon does not raise his hand. Simon and Carol have thus

declared their majority.

Car pulling over toward parking spot.

EXT. HIGHWAY - CURBSIDE - CONVERTIBLE - DAY

She takes the car curbside and parks.

Simon looks back at Melvin as does Carol. He looks

innocent. Several beats -- Melvin almost says something

-- a hidden hand gesture from Carol stops him. Finally.

Carol, whose life has been rugged but basic, feels as

strange as she does moved by Simon's trauma which is so

much more complicated than her meat and potatoes

troubles. She looks out her window -- then kisses her

fingers and touches them to Simon's cheek. A nice,

understated, gesture of friendship.

Melvin shifts INTO the FRAME.

INT. HOTEL SUITE - LIVING ROOM/CARL'S ROOM - DAY

Carol is on the phone in the living room -- she hangs up.

Carol walks into her room -- the nicest room she'll ever

have slept in... She goes to the phone and dials...

INT. HOTEL SUITE - MELVIN AND SIMON'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Melvin watches Simon struggle to unpack his especially

neat suitcase. Melvin is uncomfortable.

Simon laughs loudly in apprehension squared.

INT. HOTEL SUITE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Carol enters the common living room... Melvin is sitting

there. Carol is dealing with a number of unsettling new

factors in her life.

Carol walks to Simon and puts an arm on him. Melvin is

visibly disturbed by her gesture.

She gives Simon a kiss... Melvin deals with jealousy.

She turns to him.

She exits the room. Melvin unnerved.

INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

As Carol, dressed in a thrift shop find, enters the main

room of the suite and hears the SHOWER running -- she

sits down to wait -- through...

SERIES OF DISSOLVES

Showing the enormous length of time which transpires until

finally a seriously clean Melvin emerges from the bathroom

through a cloud of steam. They exit.

EXT. FIRST RATE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

As they drive up.

INT. FIRST RATE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

As they enters...

He reaches into the coat and check room and withdraws them.

EXT. FIRST RATE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

As Melvin takes his car back from the valet.

EXT. STREET - SHOPPING MALL - NIGHT

As the car goes right across the street to a shopping

mall.

INT. SHOPPING MALL - MEN'S STORE - NIGHT

Melvin walks to the doorway and stops suddenly.

OTHER ANGLE

CAMERA REVEALS that the floor is intricately patterned so

that passage for Melvin is impossible.

EXT. FIRST RATE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

As he pulls up - a new VALET taking his car.

INT. FIRST RATE RESTAURANT

As he enters, looks for and then spot Carol. She is

having a martini at the bar... Sitting on a stool --

watching COUPLES dance... Happy by herself... Turning

down a MAN who wants to buy her another... And Melvin

watches... Watches his date.

He enjoys watching her for a few more beats... She turns

-- Melvin makes a "Haul your ass over here" gesture...

and she smiles and walks toward him... A WAITER has

lifted her drink -- placed it on a tray and follows her.

She takes a bit of a slalom course through the tables,

giddy as the MUSIC PLAYS and couples dance in the b.g.

She notices the waiter in her trail.

Melvin watches her approach. It is all too exquisite.

He takes a breath -- it doesn't come easily.

She stops herself from saying "sexy," regathers, then...

They arrives at the table. He holds out her chair for her.

ON CAROL

Melvin has no idea he has insulted her. Sandbagged in

extreme, she gets up -- actually ready to leave.

He waves her down.

She thinks and then nods. The waiter is across the room.

This does not stop Melvin.

Amazing that something in Melvin rises to the occasion --

so that he uncharacteristically looks at her directly --

then:

Carol never expected the kind of praise which would so

slip under her guard. She stumbles a bit -- flattered,

momentarily moved and his for the taking.

Carol laughs.

Carol moves to the chair next to him... She sits very

close -- he tenses.

TIGHT SHOT

for the kiss. Their faces are close -- she looks at

him... She closes her eyes -- her face moving toward him

-- he is wide-eyed and afraid... His face almost moves

away -- in a shot this close it's almost flight... But

now his head moves back and he receives her kiss. It is

brief. Carol smiles encouragement to him and herself.

Melvin can't bear the pleasure.

Melvin's voice is soft -- hesitant, okay, vulnerable...

as he holds up his hands in a "stop" signal.

She kisses him again.

But she has already turned away and exits the

restaurant... Melvin alone and miserable.

INT. SIMON'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

He finishes dialing. He is extremely tense -- not

breathing -- a lump in his throat -- trying not to let

the anxiety immobilize him... the NUMBER RINGS twice,

then a humorless male voice:

He hangs up. His parents want no part of him and he

needs help.

INT. HOTEL SUITE - CAROL'S ROOM - NIGHT

As Carol enters with some energy. We FOLLOW her as she

goes into her room -- takes her suitcase, begins throwing

things in.

INT. HOTEL SUITE - SIMON'S ROOM - NIGHT

Carol thrusts open the door and enters...

Simon struggles with his shirt -- she helps him,

inadvertently venting some anger as she does so.

Simon laughs -- as she crosses to the bathroom and begins

to prepare a bath.

We are ON Simon settling in for sleep, when instinct or

sounds or the faint glow of hope turns him so that he

faces the bathroom and we have...

SIMON'S POV

Carol sitting at tub's edge -- a towel around her and now

as Simon looks at the bathing beauty she adjusts her hair

-- the towel falls -- a better than perfect breast

exposed...

BACK TO SCENE

He leaves the bed.

ANGLES ON HOTEL DESK

What's he up to... he takes the blotter from the desk set

and a pen from his jacket pocket which hangs on the chair

and with vigor and faint pain moves to the other side of

the bed where he turns on the light and stares at Carol.

Simon's pen moves across the blotter -- Carol sees him

earnestly engrossed, a beat of indecision and then shyly

but deliberately she lowers the towel. He's right.

She's breathtaking.

INT. BAR - NIGHT

Melvin sits alone, nursing a drink. He's been talking to

the bartender.

He sits there, just another Joe on a bar stool with his

heart breaking.

INT. HOTEL SUITE - SIMON'S ROOM - CLOSE ON SIMON - NIGHT

He's excited -- smiling... We hear Carol -- also revved.

FULL SHOT

Carol holding a pose for Simon... He is holding a

ballpoint over the back of a hotel desk blotter. His

style cramped by his cast.

He struggles with the cast, and then decides to struggle

no more. Summoning remarkable strength, he rips a piece

from the cast, freeing his hand -- he roars ironically --

a lion's roar of liberation. He is back at his center.

INT. HOTEL SUITE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Melvin is having a room service breakfast.

The door opens... Simon enters. A new Simon -- better

than ever, clearly happy -- a morning-after glow.

Carol follows his out. Her arms are filled with the

hotel soaps, shampoos, etc.

Carol looks at Melvin -- he can't meet her gaze.

Melvin reacts.

INT. HOTEL SUITE - DAY

Simon finishes dialing the phone... a brief wait, then:

ON MELVIN AND CAROL

Melvin has been reduced to straight talk as Carol brings

the bathroom bounty into the room and begins to put it in

her suitcase.

He hangs up, totally satisfied with himself and rips over

to Carol and Melvin.

Melvin stalks out.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

The car parked near a phone booth --

Carol walks up to Simon in the car.

She hands him a base ball cap.

Melvin hangs up the phone.

Melvin gets in -- goes to the glove compartment for a

special CD labelled "For Emergency Use Only." As it

PLAYS a confessional love SONGS:

Melvin hesitates and then turns OFF the SONG in mid-

proclamation of love.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING (NEW YORK) - NIGHT

As the car arrives... They get out...

She shakes her head and walks off. Simon looking at

Melvin with some sympathy.

INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT KITCHEN - NIGHT

Where Verdell's ears prick.

INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

As they enter.

The door opens, revealing them:

The dog vaults toward them -- all else forgotten as the

dog greets his two favorite people and they talk to him.

Melvin reacts.

Melvin gets up... Simon notices some of his paintings.

Simon follows.

INT. SIMON'S NEW ROOM - NIGHT

As they enter... the room clean and organized -- a small

but lovely garret.

Melvin looks at him finally -- pretensions fall.

INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

As Carol unpacks, she gives gifts to her mother and

Spencer. But clearly something gnaws at her psyche.

INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Melvin's two digital clocks are two minutes apart... each

around 1:55 a.m... He sits in a chair still fully

dressed... forlorn... Verdell in his lap. A beat then we

hear Simon's whispered voice.

Melvin is alarmed. He stops breathing as his gay houseguest

approaches.

Melvin breathes again. Simon enters the room.

The PHONE RINGS... they look at each other. Melvin

doesn't move.

Melvin nods. Simon walks into the next room... several

beats as he finds the phone. We hear him pick it up and:

ON SIMON

He walks back to Melvin's room.

INT. MELVIN'S ROOM - NIGHT

As he enters.

Melvin is quickly out of his chair -- the dog in one

mitt... he thrusts it at Simon.

As he speeds him out...

INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

As Melvin picks up the phone... He clears his throat

loudly. Following is INTERCUT between Carol and Melvin

-- the first such CUT showing Carol blasted by the throat

clearing.

He nods his head, "yes."

She's just broken up with him but she's being nicer than

ever. It's hard to know whether to die or not.

Carol hangs up. She feels strange. A shoe hasn't dropped.

Oh, hell... she missed him.

INT. MELVIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Melvin walks in anxious circles in the living room. He

is impatient.

We enters the room carrying Verdell who strains to be

allowed closer to Melvin. Simon releases him.

He moves for the door... stops suddenly, jolted.

EXT. CAROL'S APARTMENT BUILDING (CAROL'S NEIGHBORHOOD) -

NIGHT

As he parks. He exits the car -- now wary... looks at

his watch... hesitates... walks reluctantly into the

apartment house.

INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - VESTIBULE - NIGHT

As Melvin looks at Carol's doorbell with great

uncertainty.

INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Carol in a cotton wrap-around dress/bathrobe... sitting

directly in front of a fan... the windows open, reading

one of Melvin's books...

There is the briefest possible sound of a DOORBELL...

someone has jabbed her downstairs button ever so briefly

-- so briefly that she's not certain it's her DOORBELL --

until the same brief sound REPEATED... She walks to

her wide open window and looks over.

HER POV

The convertible at the curb.

BACK TO SCENE

She hesitates --

INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - VESTIBULE - NIGHT

As Melvin gives up and starts out... turning as the

sudden blast of being BUZZED into Carol's life sounds.

He bolts for the door and enters.

INT. CAROL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

She opens the door... she hears the sound of MELVIN

SOUNDING HEAVILY up the stairs... He reaches her side.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Beverly in the hallway looking on --

BACK TO SCENE

He half turns to leave.

Carol has not ever heard anything like that before...

it's sort of sexy in its sincerity.

ANOTHER ANGLE

As we see in the b.g. that Beverly, standing near her

door down the hallway, has heard at least this last

part...

Melvin, of course, cannot leave well enough alone...

But suddenly Carl is shouting to the heavens.

She disappears into her room. Carol snorts a laugh --

gathers herself. A beat.

She looks at him -- then:

Melvin glances at the cracked pattern of Carol's kitchen

linoleum and stalls at the door.

EXT. STREET - NEAR BAKERY - NIGHT

They walk quietly -- Melvin still walking with his usual

attention to where he steps.

CAROL'S POV

Melvin walking -- and though we can see an improvement --

it is still decidedly strange as he conspicuously avoids

stepping on the lines.

BACK TO SCENE

Carol sighs. It is the sound of possibilities crashing

down. Melvin looks at her -- embarrassed, self-conscious

-- his habits making him appear unworthy.

ON MELVIN

He takes this hard. It forces him to half-whisper

something he hasn't at all said to himself... given his

history... this is an extraordinary intimacy.

She starts to turn. He tugs at her arm. As she turns

back to him.

ON CAROL

She stands on the precipice of being transported away

from the logic which has been her lifeline.

That last question clearly a true question, not the least

rhetorical -- she considers her answer, then:

He kisses her. An awkward bomb of a kiss. They separate.

A tense beat. Then:

They embrace again. He does indeed do much better. A

first-class smooch. CAMERA MOVES DOWN to see his foot

land squarely on a crack in the sidewalk without his

knowledge. They break -- look at each other without a

notion of where to take it from here, and the ALMOST in

unison begin to walk away FROM CAMERA, Melvin following a

path that avoids cracks. Suddenly the lights of the

bakery turn on as it opens for business.

They walk to the bakery, Melvin avoiding the cracks. As

they enter the bakery, a WORKER moves toward them to

clean the entranceway. Melvin, forced to step back onto

a crack, this time notices -- registers the momentous

fact and joins Carol inside as we:

THE END
