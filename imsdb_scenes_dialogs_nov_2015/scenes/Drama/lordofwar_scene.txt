FADE UP

CLOSE UP on the face of YURI ORLOV.

Late-thirties, maybe the wrong side of forty, cigarette dangling

from his fingers, wearing a conservative suit and tie.

Black smoke wafts in front of his face.  He speaks matter-of-factly,

directly into camera.

The camera zooms away from his face, revealing:

Yuri alone on a battlefield surrounded by the charred carcasses of

armored military vehicles and other equipment, discarded weapons and

ammunition, desert floor stained with what appears to be blood.

The faint sound of gunfire, some distance away, carries to us on the

wind.

CUT TO:

A TITLE SEQUENCE FOLLOWS - A CONTINUOUS SHOT FROM A CAMERA

MOUNTED ON THE BACK OF A BULLET CASING - ILLUSTRATING THE

LIFESPAN OF THE BULLET.

- Gunpowder is poured into a metal casing, lead slug mounted on top.

A BULLET is born.  A perfect 39mm.

- The BULLET travels along a conveyor belt with thousands of

identical siblings in a Ukrainian factory so grey it's monochrome.

- The BULLET, picked up by a ham-fisted UKRAINIAN FACTORY WORKER, is

tossed into a crate.

- The BULLET, lying in its open crate, rolls down a chute where it's

inspected by a UKRAINIAN MILITARY OFFICER holding a manifest.  He

seems to stare directly at our BULLET.

- The BULLET's crate rattles around in an open-bed truck along an

industrial road, passes a decapitated statue of LENIN.

- The crate containing our BULLET is placed on a ship in

the cold grey Odessa harbor.  A container door closes, plunging the

bullet into darkness.

- The door re-opens.  The BULLET, still in its crate, now basks in

bright, tropical sunshine, surrounded by an azure sea.

- The crate is removed by a pair of slim, dark hands, revealing a

glimpse of the bustling, weathered port of Abidjan in the Ivory

Coast.  The crate is one of dozens unloaded from the ship.

- BULLET's POV from another open-air truck, now slogging through a

mud-clogged road in lush rainforest.

- The BULLET is unloaded from the truck in Freetown, Sierra Leone -

immediately grabbed by the young HAND of a RUF soldier.

- The BULLET is loaded into a 30-round magazine which is inserted

into an AK-47 machine gun.

- The BULLET waits - in the gloomy chamber.  Suddenly, from outside,

the sound of raised voices and gunfire.

- The BULLET and its neighbors start to rise quickly up the magazine

towards the chamber as the Kalashnikov is fired.

- Our hero BULLET is next.  Will it see action?

- Smack.  The gun's bolt strieks the explosive cap, gunpowder

ignited, the BULLET driven out of the barrel.

- Shed of its casing - now only a slug - the BULLET emerges into

bright sunshine.  It is flying down the main street in Freetown.

- The BULLET gives us a perfect point-of-view of the bullet ahead of

it.  They are both flying towards their intended target - a wild-

eyed CHILD SOLDIER, a boy no more than twelve, firing an AK-47

almost as tall as he is.

- The leading bullet narrowly misses, whistles past the boy's ear,

striking the whitewashed wall behind - one more pock-mark in a

building riddled with pock-marks.

- Our BULLET, following close behind, finds its mark, slamming into

the boy's forehead just above his left eye - his expression, oddly

relieved.

- The BULLET carves through the lobes of the boy's brain

where it is enveloped in blood, finally plunged into

darkness - the bullet's final resting place.

CUT TO BLACK

EXT.  ODESSA - MAIN STREET.  DAY.

"Towards A Brighter Socialist Future", reads a billboard in the main

street.

Fifteen-year-old YURI walks into frame.  He spies a long line

snaking away from the door of a barren grocery store.

A YOUNG COMMUNIST sits in the shadow of a statue of Trotsky in the

Soviet-style plaza, jacket and neckerchief removed in the summer heat,

poring over a Communist text.  Yuri approaches, pretends to be

interested in the statue, glances to the Young Communist's book.

The Young Communist nods at this kindred spirit.  Yuri pats his

comrade on the back, taking the opportunity to steal the boy's red

neckerchief and Lenin pin.

INT.  GROCERY STORE.  DAY.

Now wearing the pin in his own jacket along with the neckerchief and

a stern expression, YURI strides to the front of the line in the

store.

The female STORE CLERK is about to order Yuri to the back of the

line when Yuri flashes the pin.

Intimidated, the Clerk smiles and pulls a special tray from under

the counter.  In contrast to the meager offerings on the shelves,

the tray contains bags of sugar, coffee, bananas, even Pepsi.

INT.  APARTMENT - ODESSA.  DAY.

A Soviet-style apartment building.  Front door opens - YURI enters,

shopping bag in hand.

His mother, IRINA, pokes her head out of the kitchen.  Yuri holds up

a banana.

Irina shakes her head in amazement.

INT.  APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM.  DAY.

While a parade of weapons in Red Square plays silently on the state-

controlled TV, father ANATOLY and Military Cadet older brother

VITALY, shoulder bandaged, sit at a tiny table, drinking cheap vodka

and listening intently to an illegal shortwave radio - coat hanger

for antenna.

YURI joins them, careful not to interrupt the broadcoast.

He goes to pour himself a glass of vodka.  Without looking away from

the radio, his father's hand grasps Yuri's in a vice-like grip,

preventing him from lifting the bottle.

Anatoly, deep in thought, switches off the radio.  IRINA enters,

puts Yuri's "feast" on the table.

They speak Ukrainian, subtitled.

All eyes to Yuri, family confused.

The stunned family stares at him - out of the mouths of babes.  Anatoly

finally breaks the silence, pours Yuri a drink.

Yuri and the family drink to their new identity.

EXT.  CEMETERY, ODESSA.  DAY.

A sea of Jewish gravestones.

YURI and ANATOLY bribe the cemetery CUSTODIAN.

Under his father's watchful gaze, Yuri takes a rubbing from one of

the headstones - "ORLOV".

INT.  UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT OFFICE.  DAY.

ANATOLY, with YURI at his side, presents the rubbing along with

other crudely forged paperwork confirming their Jewish ancestry to a

CLERK.  "ORLOVITCH" now "ORLOV".

The Clerk gives Anatoly and Yuri the once-over, then

stamps an emigration visa.

INT.  APARTMENT, BEDROOM.  NIGHT.

Suitcase in hand, YURI surveys his bedroom for the last time.

A car horn.  He glances through the window to the communist-style

plaza below.  ANATOLY beckons impatiently to Yuri.  VITALY and IRINA

load overstuffed suitcases into an old Russian sedan driven by an

old Russian Military Officer, UNCLE DMITRI.

Yuri stares at himself in the mirror.  He replaces his stolen Soviet

pin for a necklace - a Star of David.

INT.  BEN GURION AIRPORT - TEL AVIV.  DAY.

CLOSE UP on a heavily-retouched photograph of GOLDA MEIR.  She's

still not pretty.

YURI stares up at it.

We reveal he is standing in a jam-packed, standing-roam-only

"TRANSIT" lounge.

The Pan American destination board reads: "PA 447 to NEW YORK".

EXT.  BRIGHTON BEACH - "LITTLE ODESSA".  DUSK.

In the distance, a roller coaster in Coney Island, silhouetted

against the afternoon sky.

The camera travels off the coaster to a restaurant, apartment above

it.

INT.  "CRIMEAN RESTAURANT" - LITTLE ODESSA.  DAY.

A typical Jewish establishment with all its paraphernalia - menorah

on the mantle, etc.  The family sits in a small dining room

attached to the restaurant.  ANATOLY reads the Torah as he waits

for dinner with YURI and VITALY.

YURI, older, as we now know him, studies school work.  Long-haired

VITALY watches "Band Aid" on TV.

IRINA puts a plate of mussels in front of Anatoly.

Anatoly dons his hat.

Vitaly begins eating his father's plate of mussels.  Yuri watches his

father exit.

We focus on orientation booklets from a careers fair.  Yuri shuffles

between the eagle of the CIA and the dove of the U.N.

Yuri settles on the dove.

EXT.  UNITED NATIONS.  DAY.

The idealistic YURI, ill-fitting suit, full of optimism, approaches

the United Nations Building.

He strides past Luxembourg's gift to the U.N. - a sculpture of a gun

with its barrel tied in a knot.  Never gives it a look.

He is greeted at the entrance by an attractive female U.N. Official,

VIVIAN CARLISLE.  She likes what she sees.

INT.  ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIER.  DAY.

The blue helmeted YURI is seated in a white U.N. armored personnel

carrier, the background behind him morphs from

one Third World location to another: Third World desert

to Third World rainforest to Third World slum.

EXT.  NRFL REBEL HEADQUARTERS - NORTHERN LIBERIA.  DAY.

Poolside at a recently-captured Southern-style colonial mansion, a

long way from Georgia.

A tatty pile of weapons - some from World War II - sits in front of

a long negotiating table.

YURI, blue beret, observes the CHIEF U.N. ENVOY at the table

opposite warlord ANDRE BAPTISTE, leader of the National

Revolutionary Front of Liberia (NRFL).

Baptiste, 40's, is an imposing figure.  In full uniform despite the

heat, he wears a jacket one size too small as if he cannot admit his

extra few pounds.  His THIRD WIFE stands next to him, wiping the

sweat from his brow like an intermittent windscreen wiper.

Baptiste has a U.N. document in front of him, awaiting his

signature, clearly enjoying his moment in the sun.

Baptiste shrugs.

Baptiste smiles.

Baptiste's Third Wife wipes his brow.

The Envoy has no response.

Baptiste rises from the table, leaving the unsigned document sitting

there.

Baptiste is accompanied by two armed BODYGUARDS.  Yuri's commanding

officer, CAPTAIN VIVIAN CARLISLE, motions for one of her detail to

follow - Yuri.

They reach the door marked, "MEN".

Yuri winces at the remark.

INT.  PRESIDENTIAL MANSION RESTROOM.  DAY.

BAPTISTE pisses at a urinal.  YURI and the BODYGUARDS hang back a

respectful distance.

The BODYGUARDS stiffen at the insult.  Baptiste stares Yuri down for

a moment, then suddenly bursts into laughter.  The TWO BODYGUARDS

also start to laugh - cautiously.

Baptiste washes his hands, stares at Yuri in the mirror, smiles.

Baptiste smiles and exits, leaving the words ringing in Yuri's head.

EXT.  U.N. COMPOUND - MONROVIA.  DAY.

A pep rally for the mostly male U.N. PEACEKEEPERS.  A stage has been

erected in the rundown Embassy grounds.  They chant and stamp their feet

impatiently.

A U.N. OFFICER, acting as M.C., approaches the microphone.

From behind a jerry-rigged curtain appears the vision that is AVA

CORDOVA.  She wears a dress that appears to have been sewn onto her.

She is obscenely beautiful in the squalid setting.

The peacekeepers roar and whistle their approval.  YURI, near the front

of the stage, is hypnotized.

Standing closer to Yuri than necessary, despite the crush, is CAPTAIN

VIVIAN CARLISLE (attractive in her own right but pales in comparison

with the Goddess on stage).  She catches Yuri's reaction.

Ava steps up to the microphone.

A roar of approval from the men.

They roar again.

Ava unfurls a life-size poster of herself in a swimsuit,

flirtatiously holding it up against her body.  She tosses other

posters to eager hands.

On stage, a generic-looking ROCK GROUP starts to play a cover from

the 80's - Tears For Fears' "Shout".  Ava dances enthusiastically,

provocatively.

Ava appears to make eye-contact with Yuri - blowing a kiss in his

direction.  He is paralyzed.

LATER

BACKSTAGE, YURI and other Peacekeepers observe AVA escorted towards

a huge, American car.  An inebriated U.N. PEACEKEEPER tries to get

her attention.

As the young man reaches out to her, a slick, handsome BUSINESS

MANAGER shoves him aside.

The Manager slips into the car beside Ava.  The U.N. Peacekeeper and

Yuri watch the car roar away.

EXT.  DOWNTOWN MONROVIA - BAR.  NIGHT.

YURI and two other U.N. PEACEKEEPERS get loaded on local beer with

local PROSTITUTES - one of the peacekeepers pouring beer down a

prostitute's throat.

From the shadows across the street, a LIBERIAN MAN observes the

group.

Yuri's colleagues toss some Liberian dollars at a waiter and stagger

drunkenly away from the bar, leaning for support on the PROSTITUTES.

YURI remains at the verandah, exchanges a smile with a YOUNG

PROSTITUTE, at least two years from legal.

He's tempted.  He knocks back his drink.  He approaches the girl -

presses a few bills into her hand.  She picks up her purse, makes to

leave with him but he motions her to stay.

Yuri exits alone.  The Liberian Man, across the street, follows.

EXT.  DOWNTOWN MONROVIA - STREET.  NIGHT.

YURI walks down a poorly-lit sidestreet.  He feels something in his

back - stops abruptly.  His hand reflexively goes to his holster.

Empty.

He turns.  The young LIBERIAN MAN is holding him up with his own

gun.

The Liberian puts his finger to his lips to hush Yuri.

The Liberian appears more interested in the gun than the hold-up.

The Liberian produces a crisp U.S. twenty dollar bill of his own,

offers it to Yuri.

Yuri stares at the money, bewildered.

He shakes his head.

He hands Yuri a second twenty.

The Liberian stuffs the money in the pocket of the bewildered

Yuri.

Yuri stares at the man.

The Liberian walks away, still admiring his new weapon.  Yuri stares

after him.

INT.  CAPTAIN CARLISLE'S PRIVATE QUARTERS.  NIGHT.

CLOSE ON two blue helmets lying beside each other.

YURI and CAPTAIN VIVIAN CARLISLE are under the mosquito netting of a

bed in her private quarters - trying to get each other out of their

respective clothes as fast as possible - mouths and hands

everywhere.

Even in the heat of the moment, VIVIAN is unable to completely let

go of her work.

Satisfied with the answer, she completely gives in to the throes of

passion - pulls him to her.

LATER

VIVIAN, satiated, dozes amongst the rumpled sheets, backside

exposed.

YURI uses the opportunity to take an impression of the key attached

to her belt.

EXT.  EMBASSY COMPOUND.  NIGHT.

A white armored personnel carrier sits unattended.

The LIBERIAN MAN and two COLLEAGUES approach the carrier's door.  It

opens with their newly-made key.

The men start to unload the weapons inside the carrier, spilling a

box of ammunition in their haste.

The camera drifts off the carrier to reveal YURI, behind the

barracks, counting a thick wad of U.S. dollars.

Spying a lone BULLET on the ground, Yuri picks it up.  We sense he has

made a decision from which there is no return.

EXT.  INT.  "THE CRIMEAN" RESTAURANT - BRIGHTON BEACH.  DAY.

The BULLET has been turned into a pendant, replacing Yuri's Star of

David.

YURI, wearing a sharp, new suit, enters the family restaurant.  One

table of CUSTOMERS - not exactly a thriving concern.

Yuri kisses father and Maitre d', ANATOLY, who is adding more Jewish

decoration to the window.  He bear hugs mother, IRINA, nearly

causing her to drop the plates she is carrying.

Irina notices the change in her son's appearance.

Yuri flashes his killer smile in response.

Out of their sight, he slips a hundred dollar bill into the cash

register and breezes into the kitchen.

INT.  "THE CRIMEAN" RESTAURANT - KITCHEN.  DAY.

VITALY, now chef in the family business, prepares a Russian borscht

in a kitchen unlikely to pass a health inspection.

YURI tastes the food, pretends to gag, spits it out in the sink.

Vitaly affectionately cuffs his older brother - the joke

obviously a familiar ritual.

Yuri takes his brother to the kitchen's rear door.

EXT.  "THE CRIMEAN" RESTAURANT.  DAY.

At the back of the restaurant, YURI and VITALY sit on the steps

amongst the garbage cans.

Vitaly looks at him blankly.

YURI plonks a glossy arms brochure in front of Vitaly.  He takes in

the contents.

Vitaly is still skeptical.

Yuri puts his arm around his brother's shoulder.

Vitaly smiles, looks sold.

EXT.  ISRAEL CENTRAL TEMPLE - BRIGHTON BEACH.  DAY.

ANATOLY makes his way to the synagogue.  YURI, hastily adjusting his

yarmulke, falls into step.

However, instead of the synagogue, he is fixed on another

distinguished Jewish man, ELI KURTZMAN, on a street corner also on

his way to temple.

Anatoly introduces Yuri to Eli, who regards Yuri warily.

CLOSE ON THE UNDERCARRIAGE OF A TWA 747, TAKING OFF FROM JFK.

INT.  CONVENTION CENTER - PARIS.  DAY.

A platoon of attractive YOUNG WOMEN in camouflage mini-dresses show off

the latest sniper rifles and grenade launchers.

An ASIAN BUSINESSMAN pitches hardware to YURI.  VITALY is more

interested in the girls.

Yuri notices that his vendor's attention has wandered to a suave

older gentleman, SIMEON ZAHAROFF, surrounded by eager VENDORS of all

nationalities.  The Asian man joins the enthusiastic throng.

Yuri drags Vitaly away from the sales girls.

Yuri pushes past Zaharoff's entourage.

A BODYGUARD tries to step between Yuri and Zaharoff.

Zaharoff, irritated, nonetheless humors Yuri.

Simeon looks him up and down.

Simeon walks away without another word.  Vitaly shrugs.  Yuri

fumes.

Yuri watches Simeon go, surrounded by flunkies.

INT.  HOTEL ROOM - PARIS.  NIGHT

Camouflage minidress and beret are now discarded on the floor - a

contrast to the blue helmet seen earlier.

YURI and VITALY are getting it on with two SALES GIRLS.

We pan from one couple in the living room, Vitaly, to the one in

the bedroom, Yuri.

We focus on Yuri, in the midst of the act - hears his brother's

moans in Ukrainian.

Yuri smiles at Vitaly's cries.  Something catches Yuri's eye on TV.

CLOSE UP OF A TV SCREEN

showing images of the aftermath of the suicide bombing at the U.S.

barracks in Lebanon.

EXT.  STREET - BEIRUT, LEBANON.  DAY.

A street lined with shelled buildings.

Through one of the shell holes, we glimpse YURI and VITALY with a

LEBANESE CUSTOMER.

We track with them, only getting occasional glimpses through the

holes as they make their way through the war-torn streets of

Lebanon.

They enter a building carrying a crude rendering of a Coke sign -

"Taste Life."  The model drinking the Coke is Ava Cordova.

INT.  BEIRUT WAREHOUSE.  DAY.

Inside the warehouse is a ten foot high, unruly pile of junked

weapons.

YURI and VITALY usher the CUSTOMER over to an industrial scale

loaded with assorted weapons.

The CUSTOMER checks the combined weight of the weapons.

Both men pullout calculators and start haggling over the price.

Money is finally exchanged.  Yuri and Vitaly leave the Customer with

his munitions pot-pourri.

EXT.  BEIRUT WAREHOUSE.  DAY.

CLOSE ON a row of military decorations on an army jacket.

U.S. Army Officer, COLONEL OLIVER SOUTHERN, in dress uniform,

adjusts the ribbons on his chest in the side mirror of a U.S.

armored personnel carrier.

YURI approaches.  In full view, he hands the Colonel a cut of the

money.

The Colonel places the money in the same pocket decorated with

ribbons.

EXT.  STREET - BEIRUT, LEBANON.  DAY.

YURI and VITALY walk back along the shelled street, Yuri recounting

what's left of the money.

Vitaly nods thoughtfully.

The wall explodes with gunfire.

Yuri and Vitaly drop to the ground, money flying.

The machine gun fire subsides, a shower of dust, fragments of brick

and hundred dollar bills still floating to the ground.

Vitaly, first to recover, draws his own handgun, sneaks a look

through a shell hole.

On the other side of the wall, a firing squad of MILITIAMEN has

executed one group of MEN, lying contorted, slumped against the

wall.  Their bound hands and feet give the bodies a macabre

awkwardness.

Yuri is scrabbling in the dust for the cash.

The Militiamen prepare to execute another six men.  Men?  We focus

on one HANDSOME YOUNG LEBANESE BOY, barely in his teens.

Vitaly, gun poised, goes to intervene.  A HAND, stuffed with cash,

stops him.  Yuri.

The brothers' eyes meet.

Vitaly's eyes well with tears.

After one look back to the teenage boy, Vitaly reluctantly complies

- running with Yuri, heads down, away from the scene.

As they run, the wall explodes again with gunfire.

CLOSE ON RONALD REAGAN

- a cardboard cut-out planted in a sand dune.

YURI and VITALY carry a crate from a taxi onto the desert floor in

Somalia.  A group of MUSLIM FREEDOM FIGHTERS eagerly surround the crate -

Yuri hands the Leader an Uzi machine gun.

The Muslim Leader tests it - shooting up the cardboard REAGAN.

His fighters applaud, Yuri and Vitaly slightly embarrassed.

EXT.  HIMALAYAS.  DAY.

A helicopter strains in the thin air to land on the Siachen Glacier

in the Himalayas.

YURI and VITALY, in thick parkas, emerge from the helicopter into

near-blizzard conditions.

INDIAN TROOPS, unseen at first due to their white camouflage

uniforms, descend on the chopper - eager to unload the new guns and

ammunition.

Yuri gasps for breath in the thin air.  An INDIAN SOLDIER gives Yuri

a hit of oxygen as Vitaly supervises the unloading.

Yuri nods, takes another hit of oxygen.

EXT.  BORDER TOWN - CONGO.  DAY.

The town is deserted.  YURI and VITALY are confused as they prepare

to unload an arms consignment from a truck.

Up the street, a celebration is taking place - a band, balloons,

confetti, dancing.

Finally, a Congolese man, JOHN "CANNIBAL" NGAWE, appears at the

warehouse.

The conversation is in French.

Cannibal starts to walk away.

Cannibal flashes Yuri a peace sign.

Yuri looks to Vitaly.

EXT.  NORTHERN AFGHANISTAN.  DAY.

YURI and VITALY stand at a checkpoint in the rugged mountains.  Guns and

ammunition are strapped to donkeys tended by MUJAHIDEEN FIGHTERS.  An

AFGHANI OFFICIAL inspects the cargo.

Vitaly hands the Official his documentation - clipped to it, a thick

wad of bills.

The Afghani Official smiles.  He returns to his mud-brick border

station beside the confiscated merchandise.

Yuri focuses on a swimsuit calendar hanging on the mud wall - Miss

May is AVA CORDOVA.

EXT.  FREIGHTER SHIP.  DAY.

We tilt up from the water to find YURI on the deck of a freighter,

ploughing the ballpoint blue seas off the coast of Colombia.

VITALY holds onto a railing trying to stave off seasickness, not

helped by standing downwind from Yuri's cigarette smoke.

Yuri makes a call on his cell phone.

Yuri hangs up.  His phone rings with an incoming call.

Yuri grabs a pair of binoculars.  On the horizon, a fast-approaching

speed boat - INTERPOL AGENTS visible on the racer's deck.

VITALY and the CAPTAIN, also spying the Customs Boat, join Yuri at

the railing.

Yuri swings into action, frantically dials another number on his

satellite cell phone.

The CREWMAN hastily complies.  Yuri's call is answered.

The terrified PAINTER makes for the stern where he's hurriedly

winched over.

Yuri returns to the phone call.

He hangs up.

The PAINTER, nods nervously from his precarious perch, starts to

paint.

Yuri sneaks another look through his binoculars.  The Customs Boat

is closing fast.

Yuri checks the Customs Boat again.

He checks the Painter's progress.

The Painter's hand is shaking.

Vitaly is frantically rummaging through a trunk containing dozens of

national flags.

Vitaly winces.

Vitaly turns the flag sideways - now a makeshift Dutch flag.  Vitaly

nods, impressed.

Yuri looks forward.  The Customs Boat has almost reached the bow of

the freighter.

The flag is hoisted.  The Painter, barely completing the last "O" of

"KONO", is hauled back on deck.

The CREW resume their normal duties as the Customs Boat slows to a

crawl itself, at close quarters with the freighter.

The heavily-armed INTERPOL AGENTS eyeball the rusted vessel.

YURI focuses on the senior agent - JACK VALENTINE.  While the other

agents wear sunglasses, long hair, tattoo or personalized uniform,

Valentine is completely by the book.  His Interpol windbreaker clean

and zipped to the neck.

The Customs Boat ominously circles the freighter like a hungry

shark.

EXT.  INTERPOL BOAT.  DAY.

VALENTINE never averts his eyes from the ship.

Another AGENT hands him a phone.

EXT.  FREIGHTER / INTERPOL BOAT.  DAY.

From the railing, YURI watches the Interpol boat draw alongside the

freighter.  He surreptitiously makes another phone call.

The boat is secured to the ladder that runs down the side of the

freighter.

VALENTINE checks his sidearm, climbs the ladder.

EXT.  DECK - FREIGHTER.  DAY.

Yuri spies a life ring emblazoned with the word "KRISTOL".  He flips

it around as Valentine and the other agents board.

Valentine strides past Yuri to a container, nods to an agent to open

it.  The large metal door opens to reveal a large container full of

grain - grain spilling onto the deck.

Valentine is about to plunge his hand into the grain when a mobile

phone rings.

A CREWMAN calls to Valentine from the bridge of the Interpol boat.

Valentine hesitates, returns to the ladder.

As the agents go, they fail to see the pile of grain shift in the

container exposing a crate of assault rifles hidden there.

EXT.  RAILING - FREIGHTER.  DAY.

Yuri and Vitaly watch the Interpol boat leap away.

On the FREIGHTER, we focus on the terrified PAINTER standing beside Yuri -

a pool of urine appears from the trouser leg.

Yuri pretends not to notice, slaps the Painter on the back.

CLOSE ON the word, "KONO".  From the "O", a paint drop runs down the

stern.

EXT.  BARRANQUILLA HARBOR, COLOMBIA.  DAY.

YURI and VITALY supervise the unloading of the freighter from the

dockside.

They are alerted by the sound of a battle raging somewhere on the

outskirts of the docks.

A Jeep, full to overflowing with heavily-armed NARCO-GUERRILLAS

suddenly appears at the far end of the dock and speeds towards them.

A military vehicle full of COLOMBIAN SOLDIERS chases the Guerrillas

several hundred yards behind.

The Jeep full of Guerrillas screeches to a stop by the freighter.

The NARC LEADER grabs a box of unloaded ammunition.

The Leader smashes the box on the concrete - bullets spilling

everywhere.

Yuri tries to play peacemaker.

The Narc Leader turns and shoots Yuri in the side.

Yuri shudders with the impact.  The enraged Vitaly lunges towards

the Leader but Yuri, despite his wound, holds him back.

Vitaly nurses Yuri to the ground.

The GUERRILLAS ignore them, frantically re-load just in time,

immediately start shooting at the approaching government vehicle.

The government vehicle throws a vicious 180, almost toppling over.

The Guerillas, now back in business, take off after the government

troops.

Yuri lies on the dock, genuinely surprised by the sight of his own

blood.

INT.  WAREHOUSE - BARRANQUILLA, COLOMBIA.  DAY.

YURI, now heavily bandaged around the waist, and VITALY keep a

watchful eye as the NARC LEADER inspects crates of machine guns and

other ammunition.

The Narc Leader nods his approval.

WORKERS start loading the crates into a truck.  The Narc Leader

hands Yuri the suitcase.

Yuri snaps open the suitcase - inside six kilos of cocaine.

The Narc Leader walks away.

The Narc Leader ignores him, climbs in his Jeep and drives off.  The

truck, loaded with munitions, also exits.

Yuri and Vitaly are left alone in their warehouse.

Yuri shrugs, slices open one of the packs of cocaine.  He takes a

bill from his pocket, rolls it into a tube.

He goes to hand Vitaly the tube but his brother has already rolled

his own.

Vitaly dips his tube into the coke - snorts, keeps snorting - a

longer inhale than should be possible for a human being.

INT.  HOTEL ROOM - BARRANQUILLA, COLOMBIA.  NIGHT.

Six kilo-sized coffee cans.  YURI, still bandaged, is pouring the

coffee down the toilet and replacing it with the bags of cocaine,

mumbling Ukrainian profanities as he works.

The last bag is missing.

INT.  HOTEL HALLWAY.  NIGHT.

In the hotel corridor, YURI discovers the door to the adjacent room wide

open.

Inside, the room is vacant.

INT.  BOLIVIAN BUS.  DAY.

YURI, clearly fuming, is standing in a standing-roam-only Bolivian

public bus along with an assortment of PEASANTS, MIGRANTS and

FARMYARD ANIMALS.

On the wall of the bus Yuri notices a cellphone ad featuring AVA

CORDOVA.

INT.  VITALY'S ROOM - BOARDING HOUSE.  LA PAZ, BOLIVIA.  DAY.

The outline of Ukraine drawn with cocaine.

VITALY, out of his mind, pupils the size of nickels, humming a

Ukrainian folk tune, is putting the finishing touches to the map

from his badly depleted bag of cocaine.

with him, two BOLIVIAN PROSTITUTES, who appear to have passed out or

worse.

A pounding on the door.

Vitaly, absorbed with the task at hand, appears not to notice.  Yuri

breaks in the door.

Yuri stares at the cocaine map.

Yuri opens a window, the cocaine blows off the table.

Vitaly freaks out, slams the window so hard it shatters.  (The

Hookers still don't rouse.)

Vitaly desperately tries to snort the cocaine out of the shag pile

carpet - the straw constantly clogging with carpet fibers.

Blood oozes from Vitaly's nostril.  Yuri gazes down at his pathetic

brother.

EXT.  ST. JOSEPH'S DRUG REHAB CLINIC.  DAY.

An exclusive rehab center.  A title appears:

YURI's car pulls up outside, Vitaly in the passenger seat.

Vitaly doesn't budge.

Yuri relents, pours a gram onto the dashboard.  Vitaly snorts it off

the dash.

Vitaly kisses Yuri.

Two ORDERLIES open the car door, escort Vitaly away.

Yuri watches his brother in the rearview mirror - shepherded up the

path.

INT.  CATHOLIC CHURCH - BRIGHTON BEACH.  DAY.

IRINA lights a candle in front of the Virgin Mary.

INT.  SYNAGOGUE - BRIGHTON BEACH.  DAY.

ANATOLY prays in front of the menorah.

INT.  AIR MAROC JETLINER.  DAY.

An EXECUTIVE sits in his Business Class seat.  On the tray table in

front of him, calculator and spreadsheets.

He exchanges a collegial smile with YURI who has similar

entrepreneurial paraphernalia in front of him.

The businessman's smile dissolves when he catches a glance at the

brochure lying next to Yuri's "Day-Runner" - glossy photos of

GRENADE LAUNCHERS.

A MONTAGE OF SCENES - ILLUSTRATING THE ANATOMY OF AN ARMS DEAL.

It takes place in an unidentified country in North Africa.

YURI gets off a plane.

YURI immediately picks up a newspaper, eager for the latest news.

YURI is buoyed by the front page news, over-tips the NEWSPAPER

SELLER.

YURI meets a group of REVOLUTIONARIES in a backstreet bar, shows

them an arms catalogue.

YURI meets a GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL in the parliament buildings, shows

him the same catalogue.

YURI meets the REVOLUTIONARIES a second time in the same bar - this

time they are more enthusiastic and Yuri has his calculator out.

YURI, now accompanied by bodyguards, is escorted into the government

buildings, where he's given a fat envelope.

Back at the bar, YURI is given an even fatter envelope.

YURI stands at his hotel window, sneaking a look through grimy

venetian blinds.  A street battle is taking place.

However, in Yuri's mind the sound of the gunshots is gradually

replaced by the sound ot a cash register.  Each time a gun is fired,

the register rings.

Yuri shuts the window.

Yuri boards a plane, taking off for a new conflict zone.

INT.  AIR MAROC JETLINER.  DAY.

YURI leans back in his Business Class seat - eyes closed.  They

suddenly blink open.  He feels someone watching him.

Sure enough, he is face-to-face with AVA CORDOVA - staring at him

from a magazine cover in the seat pocket next to him.

INT.  MODEL AGENCY.  DAY.

A gallery of MODELS from the late-eighties on VOGUE, HARPER'S

BAZAAR, ELLE magazine covers, blown-up and framed on a white wall.

An AGENT with a window-office overlooking Park Avenue talks on the

phone.  In front of her, the headshot of AVA CORDOVA.

The agent examines an envelope stuffed with cash.

INT.  ARMS SHOW CONVENTION HALL.  DAY.

YURI talks on a phone as he browses at an arms show.  He stops at a

display of handguns.

INT.  EDEN ROCK HOTEL - ST. BARTHELEMY, FRENCH CARIBBEAN.  DAY.

An idyllic beachfront hotel.

AVA CORDOVA enters an empty reception area.  The RECEPTIONIST hands

her a fax - Ava's face falls.

YURI sits by the deserted pool, observing her entrance.

INT.  HOTEL RESTAURANT.  DUSK.

A large restaurant overlooking the ocean.

AVA and YURI are the only guests, both eating alone.  They make eye-

contact - exchange polite smiles.

EXT.  PRIVATE BEACH.  DAY.

AVA strolls down to the beach, deserted, save for YURI - sunbathing

some distance away on one of the hundred empty sunbeds.

Ava dives into the water.  Behind his sunglasses, Yuri watches her.

LATER

Towelling off on a sunbed of her own, Ava glances over to Yuri.  It

seems crazy not to speak to each other.  Ava breaks the ice.

Yuri smiles.  Ava approaches, extends a hand.

Yuri pretends to ponder her predicament.

Ava regards him cautiously - likes what she sees.

Ava smiles, poses playfully for him.

EXT.  ST. BARTHELEMY AIRPORT.  DAY.

A limousine approaches a Lear jet parked on the tarmac of the one-

runway airport.  YURI and AVA exit the car.

CLOSE ON the tail of the jet - the name "ORLOV AIR".

They enter the plane.

As the plane picks up speed on the runway, the name "ORLOV" smears.

INT.  LEAR JET.  DAY.

YURI and AVA sit beside each other on a white leather sofa in the

customized cabin drinking Cristal champagne.

Yuri glances through Vogue magazine - a photo spread on Ava.  Ava

takes in the plane's sumptuous appointments.

He hands her back the magazine.

They both drink.  A thought occurs to Ava.

Ava regards him closely.  He's echoed her thoughts.  Yuri pours Ava

another drink.

They toast.

She meets his eye.

Yuri freezes - doesn't answer.

Yuri gazes at her a moment - he answers her question with a kiss.

Ava does not pull away.

INT.  LEAR JET - BEDROOM.  DAY.

CLOUDS rush by the faces of YURI and AVA, heads close to the plane's

oval windows.

They make love in a wall-to-wall bed built into the rear of the jet.

The camera moves past the couple through one of the plane's windows,

and the clouds begin to rain.

EXT.  ISRAEL CENTRAL TEMPLE - BRIGHTON BEACH.  DAY.

Confetti.  YURI and AVA run through the paper shower as they descend

the steps of a synagogue in Brighton Beach.

Yuri and Ava kiss his parents, ANATOLY and IRINA.

As the happy couple reaches the limousine, VITALY - out of rehab and

out of his mind - fires an AK-47 into the air as a salute.

The GUESTS drop to the ground - the only ones left standing are Yuri

and Vitaly.

Yuri stares daggers at Vitaly, helps Ava to her feet.

The guests nod, uncertain.

Vitaly lets go another burst.

INT.  UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT.  DAY.

YURI carries AVA over the threshold of their new home to cheers of

the assembled GUESTS.

ANATOLY and IRINA gape in amazement at the grand house.  They draw

their son aside.

Anatoly forces a smile.  Irina presses a gift into Yuri's hand.

Irina takes Anatoly's arm, they walk away.

Yuri, alone for a moment, opens the package - a small Roman Catholic

Bible, conveniently bookmarked at the Ten Commandments.

INT.  UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT.  DAY.

A newborn baby boy, NICOLAI, plays in the wrapping paper of opened

gifts beneath an extravagantly-decorated Christmas tree.

A family Christmas - Anatoly, Irina and Ava open gifts.  Baby Nicolai

wriggles on a blanket, trying to reach a piece of tinsel.

Irina ignores him.  She regards a gift - a silver goblet set from

Tiffany's.

Nicolai crawls an inch.  AVA beams proudly.

Ava looks around for Yuri.

No reply.  Ava wraps the piece of tinsel around the baby's head.

A loud shout from the other room.

Ava scoops up the baby.  With Anatoly and Irina, they go to

investigate.

On the television, MIKHAIL GORBACHEV, is making his famous speech,

officially ending the Cold War.

Yuri kneels in front of the TV as if it is an altar.

Yuri kisses Ava, Nicolai, Anatoly, Irina, kisses the TV.

Yuri's too busy kissing Gorbachev's birthmark.

He gazes at the TV, revelling in the plan taking shape in his head.

LATER

In the living room, AVA and IRINA play with NICOLAI.  YURI and

ANATOLY drink Johnnie Walker Black label.

Yuri goes to pour himself a drink.  Anatoly grabs his son's hand the

way he did many years earlier.

Yuri knocks back his vodka, tries to lighten the mood.

A crash.  VITALY and a call-girl, ANGEL, dressed in a low-cut fairy

dress, stumble through the front door - both the worse for drink and

drugs.

Angel laughs.  The family gazes at Vitaly and his friend, appalled.

Vitaly and Angel laugh.  No one else does.

Vitaly collapses on the floor.  Nicolai cries.

Yuri firmly escorts Angel to the door and pays her off.

EXT.  ST. JOSEPH'S DRUG REHAB CLINIC - UPSTATE NEW YORK.  DAY.

YURI drops VITALY back at the exclusive rehab center.

By now Yuri knows the routine.  He pours a gram onto the dashboard.

Vitaly snorts it off the dash.

Vitaly kisses Yuri.

Two ORDERLIES open the car door, escort Vitaly away.  Yuri stares

after Vitaly.

INT.  UPPER EASTSIDE APARTMENT.  DAY.

AVA and NICKI kiss YURI goodbye.

EXT./INT.  PUBLIC STORAGE FACILITY - MANHATTAN.  MORNING.

YURI enters a public storage facility, opens a locker with a

combination lock.

He produces several passports from the locker, shuffles the

passports like playing cards.

The locker also contains five identical briefcases - presumably he

can tell them apart.

EXT.  BORDER CHECKPOINT - IZMAYIL, UKRAINE.  DAY.

Light snow falls.  YURI, driving a brand new Mercedes, waits in a

long line of cars at the border.

A Border Guard approaches Yuri's car window.

Yuri hands the Guard his passport.  Inside, a credit card

emblazoned, "VISA".

The guard smiles.

Yuri smiles, hands him several U.S. bills.  Yuri's passport is

promptly stamped.  He is waved past the line of cars.

EXT.  ODESSA MILITARY BASE.  DAY.

YURI, briefcase in hand, meets his Uncle DMITRI at a barracks.  (NB:

Dmitri always carries a hip flask of vodka as if there is a constant

threat of radiation poisoning.)

The General gives him a great bear hug.  Dmitri registers the

apprehensive look on Yuri's face.

Yuri kisses Dmitri on the cheek to reassure him.  Over his shoulder,

Dmitri notices the car.

Dmitri is impressed.

INT.  ODESSA MILITARY BASE - OFFICE.  DAY.

YURI has a stack of VCR's, cartons of cigarettes, Johnnie Walker

Black Label on the table in front of DMITRI who drinks from his hip

flask throughout the conversation.

Dmitri can't deny it.

Dmitri hesitates, knocks back his vodka, then opens the safe -

produces a document.

INT.  ODESSA MILITARY BASE - ARMORY.  DAY.

Crates of machine guns from floor to ceiling.  DMITRI gives YURI a

tour of the armory.

Dmitri finally gets it.  Yuri examines a Kalashnikov.

This is too much for Dmitri.  He stops, confronts Yuri - takes back

the AK-47 Yuri is inspecting.

EXT.  ODESSA MILITARY BASE.  DUSK.

The sun sets over a grassy field.  YURI sits alone - closely

inspects a Kalashnikov.

It is a strange moment between a man and his favorite gun.

As we hear Yuri's thoughts, we are treated to lovingly shot close

ups of the weapon and its features often seen in slow motion:  Sun

glistening off the chromed barrel.  Folding metal stock arcing

elegantly into place.  Precise docking of the 30-round curved

magazine.

We reveal where Yuri is sitting - on the roof of a rusting Russian

sedan, the Vaz 4-door.  A goat is eating the upholstery.

Yuri checks on the crates of AK-47's being loaded into a convoy of

trucks.  In the background, the armory, full a week ago, is now

virtually empty.  Yuri smiles a satisfied smile.

His reverie is interrupted by the sound of a car horn.

A commotion at the gate.  Another large, black Mercedes is parked

there, DRIVER leaning on the horn.

YURI smiles as he sees the passenger emerge from the car - SIMEON

ZAHAROFF.

Simeon angrily confronts the SOLDIER at the gate.

DMITRI puts on his cap, about to investigate.  YURI stops him.

Dmitri shrugs and complies.  Yuri strides towards the gate.

EXT.  ODESSA MILITARY BASE - GATE.  DUSK.

SIMEON, flanked by two hefty BODYGUARDS, is in the face of a YOUNG

OFFICER.

The Officer is flanked by three SOLDIERS, Kalashnikovs resting on

their hips.

Simeon reconsiders his position.

The Officer turns on his heel and returns to his guard station with

the passport, starts watching TV.  The Bodyguards make to follow but

the Soldiers close ranks, barring their path.

Simeon fumes.

YURI breezes past the Soldiers with an easy familiarity.  He enters

the guard station as if he owns it.

From beside his car, Simeon watches as Yuri jovially discusses the

situation with the Young Officer.  After a moment Yuri slips the

Officer money in exchange for Simeon's passport.

Yuri emerges from the station and returns the passport to the

veteran gunrunner.

INT.  ODESSA HOTEL BAR.  NIGHT.

YURI and SIMEON sit at a table near the back of the bar.  Yuri flirts with

the BARMAID delivering drinks and a shellfish appetizer.

The Barmaid giggles and exits.

Simeon is clearly disquieted by the change in the balance of power or

maybe it's the bad early-nineties pop music.  His BODYGUARDS sit

at the table behind.

Simeon's look begs explanation.

Simeon shrugs.

Yuri leans forward.

Simeon regards the young man with a mixture of fear and admiration pours

himself another drink.

Yuri smiles - the proposal is the victory he has been seeking.

Simeon is confused.

Simeon blanches.  Yuri gets up.

Simeon holds his rival's arm.

Yuri departs.

INT.  HOTEL ROOM - ODESSA HOTEL.  NIGHT.

YURI and the BARMAID never make it to the bed.  Still clothed, they bang

each other against the door of his hotel room.

EXT.  UKRAINE MILITARY BASE.  DAY.

Row after row of tanks, armored personnel carriers and helicopter

gunships in mothballs.

DMITRI, flask in hand, and YURI are given a tour of the surplus hardware

by one of Dmitri's brother officers.

Yuri and Dmitri come upon an oily-faced BOY, perched on the cockpit

of a helicopter gunship - he wears an ill-fitting uniform, several

sizes too big.

Yuri shrugs, shakes the Major's hand.

EXT.  HILL OVERLOOKING ODESSA HARBOR.  DAY.

THE POV FROM A PAIR OF BINOCULARS - in the crosshairs, JACK

VALENTINE, at a surprise checkpoint, staring through binoculars of

his own.

YURI, on his belly to avoid detection, slithers back to the roadway

- hands the binoculars to a YOUNG SOLDIER.

DMITRI stands beside the convoy of trucks parked barely out of view

of the checkpoint, including Yuri's Mercedes and a huge open-bed

tractor-trailer carrying a Russian Hind helicopter gunship.

Dmitri regards the trucks, each one longer than the road is wide.

The YOUNG SOLDIER on lookout calls to them.

Yuri grabs the binoculars.  Sure enough, Valentine and his agents

are climbing into their Interpol Jeeps and driving towards them.

Yuri gazes at the Russian Mi-24V helicopter gunship, bristling with

armaments.

Yuri turns to the Boy referred to as "tech support".

The boy pulls a wrench from his pocket.

SEVERAL MINUTES LATER

The Interpol Jeeps crest the rise and pull in front of the convoy -

VALENTINE and his agents exit, guns drawn.

DMITRI and the UKRAINIAN SOLDIERS stiffen, their weapons also at the

ready.  An uneasy stand-off.

YURI gestures for calm.  He greets Valentine warmly - offers his

hand.

In reply, an Interpol Agent unceremoniously slams Yuri into the side

of his truck.

Again Yuri waves off Dmitri and his men, about to come to his aid.

Yuri courteously hands over his passport and other documentation to

the skeptical Valentine.

Valentine turns his attention to the helicopter - now devoid of its

weapons.  An Interpol Agent escorts Yuri at gunpoint.

Valentine ignores the banter, inspects Yuri's documentation.

Yuri shrugs - why not?

It's true.  Yuri has had the armaments detached.

Valentine's face hardens at the flippant remark.

Still at gunpoint, Yuri is escorted to the smaller second truck in

the convoy.  Stacked inside the container are the helicopter's

hurriedly removed missiles and the Boy.

Valentine, incensed, throws Yuri up against the truck himself.

Valentine regards Yuri closely - this foe is more formidable than he

imagined.

Valentine looks to the gun in his hand, contemplating crossing the

line.  He finally holsters his gun.

Yuri, Dmitri and the Boy watch Valentine speed away.

Yuri looks to the boy, askance - a Yuri in the making.

EXT.  ODESSA HARBOR.  DAY.

YURI supervises the loading of the cargo onto a freighter.  Checking

the empty trucks, he is just in time to see SIMEON and his HENCHMEN

climb into their car, parked beside his own car, some distance away.

As he drives off, Simeon and Yuri make brief eye-contact.

Yuri looks for DMITRI, exiting a nearby restroom - carrying his hip

flask as usual, the worse for drink.

Dmitri glances at the SOLDIERS around the docks.

Dmitri's face lights up.  Yuri hands him the keys to the SKL.

Dmitri hands his hip flask to Yuri.  Yuri watches Dmitri walk to the

car and climb in for a test drive.

A look of realization on Yuri's face.

The car erupts as if it has been punched by a fist beneath the

earth.

Recovered from the blast, Yuri runs up to the burning car but is

beaten back by the flames.

EXT.  DOCKS.  NIGHT.

CLOSE ON a bent Mercedes medallion, now worn around the BOY's neck.

He regards it forlornly.

YURI, numb, still carrying Dmitri's hip flask, makes a call from a

payphone.

INT.  UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT - MANHATTAN.  DAY.

A darkened bedroom.  AVA is fast asleep in her bed, curled up with

NICOLAI.

The phone rings.  Half-asleep, Ava reaches for it.

We cut between the two sides of the conversation.

Ava grabs her robe - goes to the balcony so as not to disturb

Nicolai.

From a bar down the street comes the sound of gunfire - MOBSTERS

firing at other MOBSTERS escaping in a car.

Yuri tries to cover the phone but Ava overhears.

More gunfire interrupts.

But Yuri has gone.

EXT.  ODESSA HARBOR.  DAY.

The freighter slips out of the harbor.

EXT.  DOCKSIDE - MONROVIA.  DAY.

Crates of munitions are unloaded from the freighter onto waiting

trucks under YURI's supervision.

Yuri sizes up the MILITIAMEN loading the arms.

As the final truck door is secured, a customized Lincoln

Continental convertible comes flying around a corner - stereo

blaring, deliberately terrorizing the locals on the dock.

The car slides to a stop beside Yuri.  It contains ANDRE BAPTISTE

JNR., a handsome young man with sunglasses, a mirror for an

earring and a facial tattoo.  Also in the car, two BODYGUARDS and

a pair of LIBERIAN TEENAGE GIRLS dressed in Dallas Cowboy

cheerleader uniforms.

Yuri ponders for a moment.  The machete in the Bodyguard's hand

makes up his mind.

A bodyguard takes Yuri's suitcase.  Yuri is barely in the car before

it screeches away.

As the car roars along the highway on the edge of control, we hear

Yuri's thoughts.

Andre announces his arrival in the main street of Monrovia with a

burst of gunfire.  The city, a violent clash of cultures.  Goats and

Gucci.

The car pulls up to Monrovia's premier hotel.  A DEAD BODY on the

ground attracts no attention whatsoever.

A PORTER, carrying Yuri's suitcase, steps over the dead body.

Yuri nods, uncertainly.

INT.  HOTEL AFRICA - LIBERIA.  DAY.

YURI enters the hotel.

At the reception desk, two HOTEL PORTERS watch a small, portable TV

- CNN coverage of the O.J. Simpson trial - gruesome evidence photos.

The CONCIERGE hands Yuri a key.

INT.  HALLWAY / HOTEL ROOM.  DAY.

YURI goes to open his hotel room door - hears music from inside,

enters.

Two stunning LIBERIAN GIRLS sit naked on the bed bopping to

Madonna's lILike A Prayer".

The two goddesses drape themselves around him.

Gloria's lips gently touch his.

Faith begins to unbutton his shirt.

Gloria's hands go to his belt buckle, start to unfasten it.

With great reluctance Yuri reaches behind him and opens the door.

EXT.  HOTEL - CORRIDOR.  DAY.

FAITH and GLORIA, still buck-naked, are tossed into the hallway,

their clothes flung after them, door slammed shut.

INT.  BAPTISTE'S PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE - MONROVIA.  DAY.

A Glock .45, Heckler & Koch .40 and a Beretta 9mm sitm on the ostentatious

mahogany desk in front of President of Liberia, ANDRE BAPTISTE - a few

pounds heavier, still wearing the same size uniform.  ANDRE JNR. watches

over his shoulder.

Andre Baptiste examines each handgun methodically.

In front of him, a pensive YURI, taking in his surroundings.  Half a

dozen gun-toting ELITE GUARDS keep an idle watch.  Several HOSTESSES tend

to a refreshments table.  On a nearby sofa, a LIEUTENANT flirts with one

of the hostesses.

Baptiste glances over to the Lieutenant, irritated.

Baptiste tests the loading mechanism.

The Lieutenant on the sofa is still not paying attention.

Baptiste casually points the gun at the Lieutenant and shoots him in

the head - a large portion of his brain splattering across the

fleur-de-lis wallpaper.

Baptiste, clearly not used to having his actions questioned, turns

the gun on Yuri.  He's next.

Yuri, staring down the barrel of the Beretta, recovers fast.

Baptiste is taken aback.  He suddenly bursts into laughter.

The other Officers laugh uncertainly.

The Lieutenant's body is dragged out - leaving a smear of blood

across the marble floor.

Baptiste, seemingly oblivious to the carnage he's wreaked, resumes

talking to Yuri, in a measured way as if he's discussing the sad

state of punctuality in contemporary society.

Yuri nods, disguising his terror.

Baptiste, checking his Rolex Oyster, rises from his desk.

EXT.  BAPTISTE'S PRESIDENTIAL MANSION.  DAY.

The camera tracks along the MILITIA - however only the very tops of

their heads are visible.

ANDRE BAPTISTE haggles with YURI as he inspects his troops ranging

from twelve to fourteen.  Yuri, averts his eyes from the boys,

uncomfortable reviewing soldiers a head shorter than he.

OLDER SOLDIERS fill the ranks behind.

Andre interrogates Yuri's eyes.

Baptiste produces a handful of uncut diamonds from his pocket.  Yuri's eyes

widen at the sight of the very precious stones.

Andre smiles.  He turns to his new Lieutenant.

Yuri and Andre watch the troops disperse.

Andre nods, grateful for the free tactical advice - regards Yuri in

a new light.

Andre smiles again.  They are going to be fast friends.

He leaves Yuri alone to examine his uncut diamonds in his hand.

EXT.  ART GALLERY - MANHATTAN.  DUSK.

A GO-BETWEEN emerges from a gallery with a wrapped painting, hands it to

YURI, waiting in a limo.

Yuri pays the Go-Between in cash, places the painting in the trunk.

INT.  LIVING ROOM - NEW YORK APARTMENT.  NIGHT.

YURI enters the front door, drops his luggage at the door.

AVA, talking excitedly on the phone, hangs up, runs to greet him.

VITALY, in the background, cocktail in hand, with another dubious-

looking GIRLFRIEND, is examining another of Ava's paintings.

Yuri and Vitaly greet each other with a nod.

He watches Ava showing off more of her paintings to Vitaly and the

latest girlfriend.

INT.  BEDROOM - NEW YORK APARTMENT.  NIGHT.

YURI kisses his sleeping son, NICOLAI, now three years old.

He places a gift at the end of his bed - an expensive-looking

microscope.

At the same time he spies an object in Nicolai's toy box - a toy

gun.

INT.  KITCHEN / LIVING ROOM - NEW YORK APARTMENT.  NIGHT.

YURI tosses the toy gun in the trash.

VITALY, still in the kitchen, catches him - pretends he didn't see.

They watch Ava in the living room sharing a joke with Vitaly's

girlfriend.

Vitaly looks askance.

LATER

Yuri and Ava are alone at the window, overlooking Central Park.  He

hands her a fresh glass of champagne.

Ava grins, goes to drink when she notices two huge diamond earrings

laying at the bottom of the glass.

They kiss.

INT.  BEDROOM - NEW YORK APARTMENT.  NIGHT.

CLOSE UP on the diamonds dangling from AVA's ears.  She wears the

earrings and nothing else as she and YURI make love.

INT.  HELICOPTER - MANHATTAN.  MORNING.

From an unmarked helicopter, JACK VALENTINE and his INTERPOL AGENTS

shadow a Mercedes sedan as it weaves through midtown traffic.

INT.  SEDAN.  MORNING.

YURI rides in the back seat of the sedan, scouring the world affairs

sections of several newspapers.

A thought interrupts his homework.

He opens the sunroof a crack, spies the helicopter tailing the car.

He closes the roof.

EXT.  PARK AVENUE.  MORNING.

The sedan enters the underpass beneath the Helmsley building - for a

moment the car hidden from aerial surveillance.

The Driver pulls over, never coming to a complete stop before Yuri

bails.  Horns blare at the illegal drop-off.

Yuri grabs Ava's painting from the trunk and the sedan pulls back

out into daylight minus Yuri - the occupants of the helicopter none

the wiser.

Yuri hails a taxi.

INT.  HELICOPTER - MANHATTAN.  MORNING.

VALENTINE observes the sedan cruising through the heart of Yonkers.

INT.  PUBLIC STORAGE FACILITY.  MORNING.

With some reverence, YURI props Ava's painting against the wall of

his private sanctuary, then goes about his business - shuffling

passports, deciding who he will be.

EXT.  NEW YORK APARTMENT.  DAY.

AVA, dressed in a robe, all smiles, pours herself a cup of coffee.

She sips the coffee at the window, glances down.

In the courtyard below, INTERPOL AGENTS are picking through the

garbage cans under the supervision of AGENT VALENTINE.  Valentine

curiously examines the toy gun.

The smile is wiped off Ava's face.  She makes brief eye-contact with

Valentine before stepping back from the window.

Slightly shaken, she picks up the phone and dials.

INT.  COCKPIT - ILYUSHIN-76 CARGO PLANE.  DAY.

The cargo hold of an Ilyushin-76 cargo plane.  It's so overflowing

with weapons, many are strapped into the passenger seats.

In the cockpit, an American PILOT and CO-PILOT keep an idle watch on

their instruments as they fly over the endless plains of Sierra

Leone.  YURI sits in the jump-seat, reading the Wall Street Journal.

An unmarked military jet appears through the starboard window.  The

voice on the radio is familiar.

The Pilot picks up the radio, looks to Yuri.  Yuri shakes his head,

dialling his satellite phone.  Yuri's call is answered.

The jet outside the window falls back.

INT.  A PENTAGON OFFICE.  DAY.

A mid-rank office dominated by a computer terminal.  We look over

COLONEL SOUTHERN's shoulder.  He is admiring a new medal.  Two other MEN

IN SUITS sit opposite.

Southern hangs up.

INT.  COCKPIT - ILYUSHIN-76 CARGO PLANE.  DAY.

YURI, hearing the response, explodes.

Suddenly machine gun fire strafes the Ilyushin - bullets tearing

through the fuselage, perilously close to Yurirs very combustible

cargo.

The jet appears again at the window.

The pilot responds on the radio.

The Interpol jet takes the lead towards a small airport.  Yuri surveys the

terrain below, getting his head back in the game.

The pilot doesn't buy it but reluctantly changes course anyway.

INT.  INTERPOL JET.  DAY.

From his own wingseat, VALENTINE observes the Ilyushin's detour,

landing on the highway.

EXT.  HIGHWAY.  DAY.

A heavily-trafficked highway.  WOMEN carrying water jars on their

heads, a thin COW pulling the carcass of a car, VENDORS selling dry

meat, CHILDREN playing war games.

The pedestrians look up to see the lumbering Ilyushin making its

final approach - they scatter.

The Ilyushin weaves on landing, hits a bone-jarring pothole.

INSIDE THE PLANE - boxes of grenades, bullets and other munitions

jump dangerously up and down.

Finally, the Ilyushin pulls up safely on the highway, engines

shutting down.  YURI's head appears out of the cockpit window.

Curious LOCALS, recovered from the shock, are gathering at the side

of the road.

The PILOTS are already halfway out of the plane door, grabbing

supplies as they go.

The pilots start running down the highway.

The pilots ignore him - run for their lives.

YURI is left alone.  He turns a lever marked, "CARGO BAY".

EXT.  CARGO BAY.  DAY.

The rear cargo bay opens.  YURI stands beside his incriminating

merchandise.

One LOCAL MAN tentatively approaches the cargo bay.  Yuri hands him

an AK-47 and a box of shells.

More SIERRA LEONESE LOCALS emerge from the side of the road,

seemingly out of thin air.

Yuri hands out more guns.

Two men oblige, ferrying the crate away.

The other locals become bolder, then brazen.

Soon it's a free-far-all.  Men, women and children swarm all over

the plane pilfering the arms and anything else that isn't bolted

down - also a lot that is.

Yuri has to exit the plane to avoid being trampled in the rush.

EXT.  HIGHWAY.  DAY.

YURI buys a Fanta from a vendor - exchanging it for a box of

grenades.

He sits on a soda crate for a front row seat at the chaos.

Yuri has a calculator out - totalling his losses.

Yuri sees the pilot seats being stolen.

Glancing up the highway, Yuri sees an approaching cloud of dust -

VALENTINE and two truckfuls of heavily-armed Interpol Agents.

Too late.  The last of the guns and ammunition are being carted away

on the back of a thin cow.

Valentine's truck fishtails to a halt beside the stripped plane.

Valentine is first off the trucks and into the plane's cargo bay -

empty.

Other INTERPOL AGENTS fan out - futilely questioning locals.

Miraculously the weapons have vanished into the bush.

Valentine calls out to the last fleeing local - a BOY with a

lifevest.

The boy stares back, defiantly inflates the life preserver.

The entire cargo has gone.  An errant bullet falls off a shelf in

the plane and rolls down the floor - Valentine picks it up.

YURI sits innocently on his soda crate.

A frustrated African Interpol Agent, MBIZI, wound-up by the chase,

rushes Yuri - slams him to the ground.

Valentine rushes over, pulls Mbizi off Yuri.

Valentine drags Mbizi out of Yuri's earshot.  Mbizi still wants a

piece of Yuri - Valentine preventing him getting to the gunrunner.

Mbizi stops struggling against Valentine.

Mbizi and another Agent reluctantly head off in a truck.

Valentine returns to Yuri who is dusting himself off.  Valentine

handcuffs Yuri himself, picks up the soda crate and sits Yuri back

on it.

Yuri remains handcuffed, sitting on the soda crate - dwarfed by the

cargo plane.  Valentine paces beside him.

Yuri regards his interrogator curiously.  Despite the sun beating

down, he feels obliged to give him his version of the facts of life.

He regards Valentine with something approaching pity.

Valentine appears to have no answer.

Now Valentine smiles.

Yuri looks away, knows where this is going.

Valentine looks to his watch.

Valentine walks away.  Yuri is left to ponder the notion.

We see time lapse photography of Yuri waiting out his twenty-four

hours, under armed guard on the highway - stretching his legs,

eating a suspicious-looking sandwich, going to the bathroom, the sun

arcing across the sky - all the while his plane is being

cannibalized by the locals.  Finally the time lapse slows back into

real time.

Valentine returns in a Jeep with Mbizi and other Agents.

Valentine opens the back of the Jeep.  Lying in the back, the bodies

of the two PILOTS shot and stripped.

Yuri turns away from the sight.  His handcuffs are removed.

Returning Yuri's documents, Valentine notices a photo of AVA and

NICKI in the wallet.

Valentine and the Agents get back in the truck and drive away.

EXT.  HIGHWAY.  DUSK.

YURI starts to walk down the deserted highway alone - his cargo

plane is now just another carcass in the jungle.

A CONVOY of armored personnel carriers barrels past him - the color:

U.N. white.  The lead car slams on its brakes, bringing the train to

a stop.  A woman pokes her head out of the window - CAPTAIN VIVIAN

CARLISLE.

Yuri steps back into a vehicle with which he is very familiar.

Yuri nods in understanding.

INT.  HOTEL AFRICA - YURI'S HOTEL ROOM.  NIGHT.

A weary YURI enters his room.  Sitting on the green sofa - bound and

gagged, face reduced to pulp, silver hair matted with blood -

SIMEON.

ANDRE JNR., a FLUNKY and his CHEERLEADERS appear from behind the

door, laughing at his shocked reaction.

Yuri stares into the old gunrunner's terrified eyes.

He offers Yuri a Beretta.

Yuri spits on Simeon.

Andre again offers Yuri the Beretta.

Andre offers him the gun a third time.  Yuri refuses it.

Andre grabs Yuri and presses the gun into Yuri's palm, clasping his

own hand over Yuri's.

Andre forces Yuri's finger onto the trigger as he aims at the

terrified Simeon - eyes pleading.

Yuri attempts to pull his hand away but Andre is too strong.

Andre stares at Yuri not Simeon.

Yuri opens his mouth but no word comes.  Andre presses Yuri's finger

onto the trigger.

The gun goes off.  A splash of blood across the sofa's green

upholstery.

The gunshot echoes around the room.  Simeon is very dead.

Andre smiles.

INT.  HOTEL AFRICA - LIBERIA.  DAY.

YURI collapses on the bar - gestures to the BARMAN who immediately

pours a line of cocaine in full view.

YURI hoovers it up.

The Barman nods to a patron at a corner table - a SEASONED FIGHTER

- no more than eighteen years old.

The Barman starts chopping another line.

Sure enough the Barman pours the gunpowder from one of Yuri's 39mm

shells into the cocaine.

The SEASONED FIGHTER, assault rifle slung over his shoulder,

intimidating air, sidles up to Yuri - stares him down.  Yuri has no

option, does a line.

He washes it down with a swig from a vodka bottle, raises his glass

to the fighter.

The Barman puts on a Ukrainian folk song.  Yuri picks out one of the

PROSTITUTES in the bar, starts dancing.

He drunkenly dances with one PROSTITUTE after another - the dance

almost violent, the prostitutes flung aside, none lasting more than

a few seconds - caught in the arms of the other PATRONS.

To Yuri, the bar swims before his eyes.

The music stops.  Yuri, wild-eyed, looks at the stunned bar room.

EXT.  MONROVIA.  NIGHT.

A MONTAGE OF SCENES FROM YURI'S P.O.V. IN HIS ALTERED STATE.  [A

MIXTURE OF FORMATS INCLUDING SUPER-8 & VIDEO, SHAKY HANDHELD

FOOTAGE, OVER-EXPOSED FOOTAGE, BLACK & WHITE FOOTAGE EDITED OUT-OF-

SEQUENCE WITH JUMP CUTS AND FLASH FRAMES]

YURI staggers towards the edge of town - still swigging from his

bottle.

A ROOM WITH A CURVED CEILING ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF MONROVIA

YURI, eyes unable to focus, stares at a WOMAN'S FACE in front of

him, moving back and forth.  The gyrating stops.

Yuri realizes he is lying in the mouth of an enormous cement pipe on

his back, a prostitute on top of him.  She gets to her feet,

adjusting her dress.

Yuri panics, hurriedly zipping himself.

The prostitute tosses a couple of bills back to him.  Yuri ignores

the money, staggers after her.

She ignores him.

Yuri staggers to his feet - wanders aimlessly across a field.

A DANCE IN DUST SOMEWHERE ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF MONROVIA

Two dozen pairs of feet chase each other on a dirt field to cheers

from a crowd.  The dust clears, revealing a bundle of cloth and

string doubling as a soccer ball.  The game is between two

indistinguishable teams of MONROVIAN YOUNGSTERS on a makeshift dirt

field, goalposts constructed from tree branches lashed together.

YURI wanders onto the field, joins the game without asking.  The

players humor him by letting him have the ball.

Yuri dribbles up field, takes an enormous swipe at the ball, misses

completely, clattering to the ground.

The crowd and players laugh.  The game goes on.  Yuri, also laughing

but in a far more desperate manner, picks himself up and wanders

away.

A LIBERIAN BAR CALLED "ZANZI-BAR"

YURI throws up at the back of a saloon flimsily constructed from

rusted corrugated iron.

Rinsing out his mouth with vodka, he is distracted by the sound of

two little GIRLS arguing.

The GIRLS approach Yuri - no older than seven, formal white dresses,

hands politely behind their backs.

One of the girls shows Yuri a healed stump where her hand should be.

Yuri runs away.

A MODERN SCULPTURE SOMEWHERE IN MONROVIA

YURI passes in front of an abstract arrangement of holes that turns

out to be a building pock-marked with gunshells.

Suddenly a FACE appears in one of the holes - SIMEON.  The gunshot

wound in his forehead still evident.  Yuri gasps.

Simeon turns and walks away - revealing a large exit wound in the back

of his head.

Yuri pokes his head through the hole but Simeon has vanished.  Yuri

turns back to find himself trapped by TWO MEN in flip-flops, shorts,

Gap T-shirts and AK-47's.

Through Yuri's eyes the two men look like four.  The two/four men go

through Yuri's pockets, take his watch, shoes.

Yuri is oddly compliant - clumsily helping one of the thieves fasten

the watch.

One of the men, tired of Yuri's antics, aims his gun at Yuri's head.

His colleague stops him.

The man fires at Yuri.  The gun jams.  Yuri looks almost

disappointed.  The man tries again.  Again the gun jams.

The man whips the gun across Yuri's face.

A PATH OUTSIDE MONROVIA

YURI, face streaked with blood and dirt, wanders aimlessly through

the brush outside Monrovia.

A HYENA appears on the dirt path in front of him - teeth bared,

frenzied eyes.

Yuri stares at the wild dog - starts to quietly cry.  Tears roll

down his cheeks.

The hyena runs away.  Yuri is alone.

EXT.  MONROVIAN DOCKS.  DAWN.

A vacant-eyed YURI sits in the shadow of an enormous stack of arms,

unloaded from a freighter.

A presidential motorcade appears on the dock.  ANDRE BAPTISTE

emerges out of his Mercedes Jeep, gun in his hand.  He strides up to

Yuri.

Yuri doesn't flinch.

The man's face falls.  The real ANDRE BAPTISTE emerges from the car with

ANDRE JNR.

Baptiste brandishes a copy of the New York Times.

CLOSE ON the headline, "U.S. SUPREME COURT REVERSES RECOUNT RULING".

Yuri just smiles.

Andre shrugs.  He regards the inactivity at the dock.

Yuri gestures down the dock where food is being loaded into trucks

marked, "HUMANITARIAN AID"

Andre Baptiste and Andre Jnr.  are clearly taken with the idea.

Andre Baptiste hands Yuri his payment - a slim briefcase containing

a pouch of uncut diamonds.

INT.  UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT.  DAY.

From behind the cover of a sofa NICOLAI shoots at an unseen foe, his

finger as the gun.

The camera pans around the room to find AVA in an armchair opposite

AGENT VALENTINE.

Valentine is unfazed.

Valentine rises to leave.  Ava holds Nicolai, her mind reeling.

INT.  FASHION SHOW - NEW YORK.  NIGHT.

Impossibly thin MODELS strut along a transparent lightbox of a

runway, flanked by SOCIALITES and PAPARAZZI.

Projected on the wall behind them, the words, "FASHION AGAINST HATE

- Dress Not To Kill" and various images from the world's warzones.

Each outfit is enthusiastically applauded.

AVA appears from behind the wings in a designer gown.  She modestly

accepts the applause - gradually becomes aware of a projection on

her face.

She turns to see the projected image of a CHILD holding an AK-47.

When she turns back, tears are rolling down her face.

INT.  NEW YORK HOUSE.  NIGHT.

Back to us, AVA naked, sits on the end of her bed, clothes laid out

beside her.

YURI, still carrying his suitcase, appears in the doorway.  He drops

the case.

Yuri senses something very wrong.

He finds a robe from the closet - gently places it around her.  She

pulls it off her shoulders.

Yuri pulls the robe back onto her shoulders, walks to the window.

Ava pulls the robe to her, follows Yuri to the window.

Yuri notices the Interpol business card on the bedside table.

Yuri sighs, resigned.

Ava meets his eye.

Yuri looks away.

He doesn't answer - perhaps he doesn't have one.  Ava looks out of

the window at their expensive view.

The words finally register with Yuri.

Ava is skeptical.  He holds her, reassures her.

She interrogates his eyes for the truth.

Ava picks up the dress off the bed.

Yuri gazes at her.

She turns back and smiles.

EXT.  FIFTH AVENUE AT CENTRAL PARK EAST.  DAY.

A YOUNG INTERPOL AGENT, carrying a tray of coffee, approaches a

plain panel van parked outside Yuri's apartment building.

The van door opens to reveal VALENTINE and other INTERPOL AGENTS,

wearing headsets, monitoring a scanner device.  The agents read

porn to keep themselves amused - except Valentine.

INT.  UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT.  DUSK.

YURI toys with his old BULLET pendant as he talks on the phone.

For once the spreadsheets in front of him deal with oil and timber.

With the cordless phone to his ear, Yuri wanders to the kitchen.  He

tosses the pendant down a trash chute.

Back in the den, Yuri punches a calculator as he continues his phone

call.

Finally we are privy to the conversation.

Yuri hangs up, stares down from his apartment window.

Valentine's panel truck drives away.

LATER

Night has fallen over Central Park - criss-crossed by a necklace of

lights.  Yuri continues to stare out of the window.

He is perplexed by the sight of a diplomatic motorcade parked in front of

his building.

Before he can make sense of it, the house phone rings.

AVA enters.

Yuri, stunned for a millisecond, recovers with a smile.

INT.  LOBBY - UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT.  DAY.

ANDRE BAPTISTE is admiring his new uniform in a gilt edged mirror.

ANDRE JNR. is flirting with two TEENAGE GIRLS - residents of the

building.  The perplexed DOORMAN stares at the motorcade outside his

door - flashing lights on the police escort.

YURI, ashen-faced, hurriedly exits the elevator into the ornate

lobby - strides up to Andre Snr.

He shakes Yuri's hand firmly.

Yuri realizes that Andre has placed a huge uncut diamond in his

hand.

Andre Baptiste and his son breeze out of the lobby.

INT.  UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.

YURI enters, sits in an armchair.  AVA and NICOLAI are cuddled on

the sofa - Ava reading him a fairytale.

Ava smiles, carries on reading.

Yuri looks to his hand - we rack focus to the uncut diamond.  Yuri

gets up.

INT.  UPPER EAST SIDE APARTMENT - GARBAGE ROOM.  NIGHT.

YURI, still in his suit, stands in a dumpster, searching.

Amongst a pile of rotten food he finds his necklace containing the

BULLET.

Yuri places the bullet around his neck.

INT.  NEW YORK APARTMENT.  MORNING.

AVA is fastening eight-year-old NICOLAI's coat, readying to go out.

YURI, half-dressed, appears in the hallway.

Nicolai kisses his father.

Ava kisses Yuri.

A thought occurs to Yuri.

Yuri's turn to interrogate her eyes.  Ava smiles.

Ava gives Yuri a final kiss, hurries Nicolai out the door.

INT.  MERCEDES SEDAN.  DAY.

From the rear seat of a Mercedes sedan we observe YURI exiting the

apartment building and entering a waiting Mercedes sedan of his own.

We reveal AVA and NICOLAI in the car.  Yuri's car pulls away and

Ava's car follows.

EXT.  PUBLIC STORAGE FACILITY.  DAY.

YURI locks his storage locker, observable from the street, and exits

the facility carrying a passport and briefcase.

Returning to his car, Yuri fails to notice that AVA has witnessed

his routine from her own car.

Instead of following the car, Ava exits with Nicolai.

INT.  PUBLIC STORAGE FACILITY.  DAY.

AVA, NICOLAI in tow, approaches Yuri's locker.

She tries a combination - fails.  Tries another - fails.  A third -

same result.

Ava looks to Nicolai, tries one more combination, reluctantly.

CLOSE ON the numerals on the lock - "10...6..."

"90".  The lock opens.

Ava opens the storage room door - at first struck by the exhibition

of her paintings inside the locker.  Shaking the image from her

head, she turns her attention to the briefcases and other documents.

She shuffles through the passports in horror - different photos of

Yuri, different names: "George Eagleman", "Georges D'Aigle", etc.  Who

is her husband?  Is he any of them?

INT.  "THE CRIMEAN" RESTAURANT - DAY.

VITALY is back at work in the kitchen of the family restaurant.

YURI approaches - Vitaly senses something amiss.

Vitaly is hardly surprised.

Yuri glances to his parents, ANATOLY and IRINA, at the restaurant

counter, folding napkins - observing their two sons.

They avert their eyes.

The notion touches Vitaly.  Yuri closes the deal.

Vitaly looks to his PARENTS.  They stare at him until he averts his

eyes.

Vitaly can't refuse his brother.

EXT.  HIGHWAY - SIERRA LEONE.  DAY.

A fork in the road.  Two large trucks slog through the bush -

take the left fork.

YURI, VITALY and ANDRE JNR. are in the cab of the truck, beside the

DRIVER.

Andre is admiring his new M60 machine gun with attachable grenade

launcher - the gun of Rambo.

Yuri stares out of the window.

The truck passes a checkpoint marked by two skulls.

EXT.  REFUGEE CAMP - SIERRA LEONE.  DAY.

A tent city.  A Jeep packed with young, machete-wielding FREEDOM

FIGHTERS circles the refugee camp, taunting and terrorizing the

inhabitants.

The mostly WOMEN and CHILDREN are trapped by the circling Jeep.

Whenever a refugee attempts to escape, they are driven back by the

increasingly manic, shrieking rebels.

Yuri's two trucks are parked on the roadway above the camp where the rest

of the REBELS are massed - a rag-tag mob wearing over-sized sneakers,

carrying machetes and the occasional AK-47.

At a small folding table a REBEL LEADER negotiates with YURI and

ANDRE JNR.  The Leader places a pile of uncut diamonds on the table.

VITALY is more interested in the camp - observing the circling Jeep

full of Rebels and their smirking comrades on the highway.

From a distance, he spies a WOMAN and YOUNG SON make a desperate bid

for escape from the camp.  Two REBELS, on foot, give chase.  The

woman appears to be pregnant.

Vitaly watches in horror.  The Woman is quickly overtaken and hacked

to death.  Then the Boy.  Vitaly can't look, turns away.

Vitaly comes to a horrific realization.

He hurries to Yuri, still negotiating with the Rebel Leader.

Vitaly draws Yuri out of earshot.

Yuri flinches.

The suspicious Rebel Leader and Andre Jnr. approach the two

brothers.

Yuri draws Vitaly further away.

The Rebel Leader approaches again - this time he's not leaving.

Vitaly realizes the futility of the discussion, backs down.

Yuri pats his brother on the back, returns to the negotiating table.

Vitaly heads for the trucks.

For once we follow Vitaly.  Andre Jnr. regards Vitaly warily.

INT.  TRUCK.  DAY.

The prongs of a hammer on a box of grenades.  VITALY is prying open

the lid.

Andre Jnr. appears behind him - M60 poised ominously on his hip.

Vitaly closes the lid - a ruse.  He picks up the hammer and in one

sudden, violent motion swings it across Andre's face, smashing his

jaw, teeth flying, Andre's body flopping like a rag doll.

Vitaly grabs two grenades from the box, pulls the pin from one and

bowls it into the truck.

He runs.

The truck explodes in a fireball - instantly incinerating Andre Jnr.

Yuri's head whips around.  The Rebel Leader's head whips around.

Vitaly dashes for the second truck.

The REBEL LEADER opens fire, raking Vitaly with machine-gun fire -

still trying to run with legs torn to shreds.

A second hail of gunfire - all REBELS firing.  Vitaly's legs betray

him.  He collapses to the ground in a pile of blood and dust.

We focus on Vitaly's still FACE - he has taken enough bullets to

kill him three times over.  But he is not quite dead.

Agonizingly slow, he raises the grenade hand to his mouth - pulls

the pin with his teeth.

CLOSE on Vitaly's HAND, trying to summon the strength to throw the

grenade.

A hand appears, grasps Vitaly's hand - gently but firmly removing

the grenade.

YURI.

The Rebels keep their guns trained on Yuri, unsure where his

loyalties lie.  Yuri holds the fate of the camp in his hands - he

could still toss the grenade, destroy the second truck, sacrifice

his life.

Yuri stares to his brother and then to the grenade in his hand.  He

reaches down and delicately takes the pin from between Vitaly's

lips.

The eyes of the brothers meet for the last time.  Yuri inserts the

pin into the grenade, disarming it - the life goes from Vitaly's

eyes forever.

Yuri removes any last doubt by tossing the disarmed grenade to the

Rebel Leader.

Yuri walks away from Vitaly's dead body and returns to the

negotiating table - Yuri now the living dead.  The Rebel Leader

looks to the two trucks - one burning, one not.  He removes half of

the diamonds from the table.

EXT.  TRUCK.  DAY.

YURI sits in the cab, staring out of the window as the truck drives

away.

The truck turns the bend.  In the background, true to Vitaly's

prediction, the rebels descend on the tent village, firing

indiscriminately with their new weapons.

Yuri hears the sound - we detect a barely perceptible flinch.

INT.  REAR OF TRUCK.  DAY.

A lone gun crate, emptied of its contents has been put to use as

VITALY's makeshift coffin.

EXT.  SIERRA LEONE MARKET.  DAY.

"America's Funniest Home Videos" plays on a TV set.  The canned

laughter appears to be almost directed at YURI who is making a long-

distance call on a geriatric telephone.

We aren't privy to the conversation.

We pull back to reveal the makeshift coffin sitting at Yuri's feet.

INT.  J.F.K. AIRPORT - CUSTOMS BAY.  DAY.

CLOSE ON the screen of an X-RAY machine.  Innocuous oversize cargo

passes in front of the screen - a surfboard, a double bass, then the

crate containing VITALY's body.

The OPERATOR of the machine, stops the conveyor belt.

In Vitaly's chest, a bullet.

INT.  J.F.K. AIRPORT - CONVEYOR BELT.  DAY.

The other oversize items move down the conveyor belt for collection

- YURI waits with two burly PORTERS.

No other items are appearing - finally the coffin containing VITALY.

Two ATF AGENTS appear behind Yuri.

The agents are not amused - handcuff Yuri.

They march him away.

INT.  NEW YORK APARTMENT.  DAY.

A phone rings.

AVA, out in the hallway, surrounded by suitcases, looks to the

phone, senses the identity of the caller.

She hustles NICOLAI out of the door, closes it behind her.  The

phone continues to ring.

INT.  MANHATTAN CENTRAL JAIL.  DAY.

YURI, on a payphone, in the jailhouse corridor, reluctantly hangs

up.  He makes another call.

INT.  "THE CRIMEAN" RESTAURANT - BRIGHTON BEACH.  DAY.

ANATOLY, lighting a candle, picks up the phone.

Anatoly looks at the telephone receiver in his hand - without

another word he passes the phone to IRINA.  ANATOLY walks away.

INT.  INTERVIEW ROOM.  DAY.

CLOSE ON a SLUG in an evidence bag tossed onto a table - by VALENTINE.  The

Agent can scarcely contain his excitement.

YURI sits at the small table, stares at the slug.

Yuri doesn't take the bait.

Two other AGENTS sit at the back of the room observe the

interrogation.

The flippant comment gets under Valentine's skin but he keeps his

temper in check.

Yuri not so cocky now - waits to see where this is going.

A front photograph of VALENTINE posing beside Yuri's documents including

his five BRIEFCASES.  The headline reads, "MERCHANT OF DEATH IN CUSTODY".

Caption - "Catalogue of carnage."

Yuri takes all this in.

Yuri nods - picks up the newspaper.  But instead of reading about

his own front page news, he opens the paper, turns to World Affairs

- various items on the warzones at the end of the millennium.

Yuri reads, takes his time.  Valentine cannot believe his audacity.

Finally Yuri reacts.  A broad smile - his killer smile.

Valentine is infuriated by Yuri's casual demeanor.

Yuri is looking away, apparently completely unconcerned.  His

attitude further angers Valentine.

Valentine laughs derisively.

Yuri is still unfazed.  He leans forward to close the deal.

Valentine's turn to hesitate.

Yuri nods to the interview room door.

A montage of scenes - Yuri's prediction plays out accompanied by his

commentary.

INT.  INTERVIEW ROOM.  DAY.

A knock at the door and an AGENT nods to VALENTINE.

INT.  HALLWAY - JAIL.  DAY.

Sure enough, a decorated military OFFICER talks to VALENTINE in the

hallway as Yuri describes.

We observe valentine's reaction - vigorously arguing with his

superior.

The Officer, still turned away from us, tries to calm Valentine.

INT.  HALLWAY - JAIL.  DAY.

The door to the interview room opens.

Yuri exits the cell to freedom.

We return to the present.

INT.  INTERVIEW ROOM.  DAY.

VALENTINE's eyes burn into YURI.

Valentine is starting to get a sick feeling.

There is a long silence.  Then,

A KNOCK AT THE DOOR.

Valentine and Yuri exchange a look.  Valentine rises from the desk.

Valentine turns on his heel.  He is at the door when Yuri finally

replies.

Valentine doesn't look back, exits.  Sure enough, the Officer is in

the hall as Yuri predicted - COLONEL SOUTHERN.

EXT.  MANHATTAN JAIL - REAR EXIT.  DAY.

A car trunk closes on Yuri's five briefcases and other documents.

YURI is escorted out the rear entrance of the city jail to the nondescript

sedan by COLONEL SOUTHERN.  As he's ushered into the car, Southern hands

Yuri yet another briefcase.

COLONEL SOUTHERN ushers Yuri into the car, hands him yet another briefcase

as the car door closes.

INT.  NONDESCRIPT SEDAN.  DAY.

YURI rides alone with the briefcase on his lap.

Yuri opens the case - BALES OF CASH.

EXT.  MANHATTAN.  DAY.

The nondescript sedan melts into rush-hour traffic.

EXT.  SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE EAST - DESERT CHECKPOINT.  DAY.

A checkpoint in the desert - the fence a literal line in the sand.

YURI accompanies a convoy of trucks.  He is joking with a BORDER

OFFICER - back to doing what he loves.

The Border Officer inspects the crates in a truck, reads the

manifest marked, "UMBRELLAS - QTY: 4,040 units".

Yuri hands the Officer a plain, brown paper bag.  The Officer looks inside

- a wad of cash.

The Officer waves the convoy through.

EXT.  DESERT - BATTLEFIELD.  DAY.

The desert where we first found YURI, the aftermath of a battle.  He

speaks directly to camera once again.

His thought is interrupted by a burst of gunfire.

Yuri walks away through the charred munitions and black smoke.

In the distance the sound of sporadic gunfire.

FADE TO BLACK
