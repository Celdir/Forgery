In the dark I.C.U. room, Hal is still attached to many I.V.s,

Oliver is helping Hal look at a book of Japanese rock gardens

with a flashlight.

Oliver opens it, they look at a few pages together, photos of

serene gardens.

Hal keeps peeking at a bouquet of flowers in the corner of

the room. Hal takes the flashlight from Oliver and guides it

to the flowers.

Hal continues to direct the light across the room, we follow

the circle of light as it moves a cross a wall landing on a

painting.

Hal continues exploring, Oliver's enjoying his father's

curiosity, he lands on some photos displayed on the table.

Hal slowly moves the flashlight up the wall, across the

ceiling to a strange assortment of fire detectors,

sprinklers, sensors, all laid out against the acoustic tile

ceiling. Hal points up. Oliver looks for a beat, then...

Oliver looks from the ceiling to the rock garden book. The

ceiling and the gardens look the same. Oliver is moved by

Hal's confusion. ANDY, 45-years-old, physical, boyish, storms

into the room.

Andy gets on the bed opposite Oliver. He gives Hal a big kiss

on the lips. Hal glows. Oliver backs away slowly. Andy picks

up Hal's hand, turns it palm up and presses his face into it.

Oliver watches from outside the room as Andy excitedly pulls

a portable tape player out of his bag.

Andy pushes play, on the recording we hear Andy's voice:

We hear voices HOOTING, and then large FIREWORKS, LAUGHTER

and CLAPPING.

Oliver watches his father's happiness from a distance.

they are dancing with no music as Oliver sits on a couch

depressed dressed as Sigmund Freud, complete with wig-beard-

glasses-pipe.

INT. OLIVER'S FRONT DOOR

Oliver, Elliott, and Shauna are leaving. Arthur can't believe

he's being left behind. It's actually the first time they

will separate.

Oliver tentatively shuts the door, takes three steps, Arthur

begins to howl. Oliver tries to ignore it, but stops again.

He looks back at the house and the howling.

INT. OLIVER'S CAR - DRIVING

Arthur, victorious, sits in Elliot's lap in the front seat,

INT. HOUSE PARTY - NIGHT

Oliver carries Arthur, they all enter a costume party, making

their way through the crowd of people in all kinds of

disguises, music blaring, Oliver slides into the less

populated kitchen. A woman rushes up to Oliver, surprised to

see he has a dog.

In the background are a couple dressed as JULIAN and ETHEL

ROSENBERG, we see them observe Oliver and Arthur.

Arthur promptly sits down. Oliver's totally surprised.

Arthur sticks out his paw. Oliver doesn't like seeing Arthur

blindly perform.

Oliver picks up Arthur and escapes the kitchen. The

Rosenberg's are still watching.

LATER...

Oliver and Arthur sit in a chair next to a couch where a man

dressed as a witch, complete with green face and long black

hair, is lying back as if in a traditional analysis session.

Oliver is playing along, but he's really not emotionally

ready for this party. He feels very far away.

The witch moves on.

Oliver sits with Arthur in his lap, alone, lost in all this

joviality.

We see that the woman dressed as Julius Rosenberg is watching

him.

Just as Oliver is about to get up, she plops herself down

onto the couch, ready for her session.

She pulls out a writing pad, oblivious. Oliver can tell she's

not going to give it up.

The woman writes on her notepad and shows it to Oliver:

"Never had one."

She mimes shooting herself in the head and dying.

She writes on her pad: "I have laryngitis"

She smiles at him, looks at him a little too long, Oliver is

more and more pulled in by her playfulness - she writes:

"Why are you at a party if you're sad?"

CU on Oliver, surprised and impressed by her observation.

Ethel holds up her notebook. She has drawn TWO EYES.

Oliver's taken by her.

She smiles and nods.

Oliver moves to--

Elliot and Shauna are deeply engaged in conversation with

someone dressed as a pickle and someone dressed as much less

colorful chicken.

Oliver slips past, hands Arthur to Elliot. He scoops ice

from the bucket and starts filling two cups.

Oliver leaves Arthur in Elliott's arms.

too intensely, then blurts out.

Oliver's going to be shy, but he breaks into a kinetic,

angular, dance. She's surprised with us - she laughs, they

have a good time.

JUMP CUT THROUGH THE NIGHT: Oliver, "Julius", Elliott and

Shauna are talking to a magician. "Julius" picks a card, the

He leaves.

look at each other nervously.

They sit on her bed. She steals his pipe, put's it in her

mouth -- writes on her pad and shows it to him.

She writes and present him with a new question.

She looks at him with sincere empathy and surprise. Oliver's

opened up, an now everything gushes out, he barely knows what

he's saying.

She's very surprised.

There's a quiet moment of deep connection.

She mouths "No" (don't say sorry). She reaches out and gently

runs a finger across Oliver's brow and the outline of his

face, he's so vulnerable, she lovingly/mischievously squishes

his face together and messes up his hair. Then she leans in,

and they kiss for the first time - delicately.

They lay down, she takes his arm and pulls him into spooning

her. He pulls the covers over them.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

Oliver wakes, still in his clothes. ANNA is already up. She

waves and Oliver smiles.

Anna holds up her notebook: "Who are you?"

She writes again: "Go to NY. Audition. Back Thursday."

Anna holds up one finger.

Anna shakes her head and smiles. She gestures smaller.

She pantomimes a camera rolling, and herself acting.

Oliver smiles as he interprets her gestures.

She makes a casual tossing motion with her hand.

Anna only shrugs. She writes more, and tosses the notepad on

his lap. Oliver reads: "Can I see you again?"

He's very happy.

the title: America's Sweethearts. Oliver's lost in memory...

INT. HAL'S HOSPITAL ROOM

Hal sit's on top of his hospital bed, wearing one of his all

corner, as we continue to hear Dr. Long speak, we see

Oliver's thoughts, fixating on "a mass about the size of a

follows. While nothing has really been expressed between the

two, Anna seems to understand the problem.

her. She pushes back. They pause. She traces his brow slowly

with her index finger, the way she did their first night.

Oliver, Anna and Arthur walk up to a typical L.A. Taco truck

on the side of the street. There is nothing fancy looking

about it.

JUMP CUT: They're sitting on milk crates by the truck, ready

to take their first bite, Anna dives in un-selfconsciously,

we're not sure what she thinks.

Oliver's so relieved.

Anna can barely swallow her huge bite...

INT. ANNA'S HOTEL ROOM

They lie on the bed, continuing their conversation, side by

side, looking up at the ceiling together.

She reaches up with her hand, their fingers intertwine.

Oliver nods yes. They know each other much better than either

one knew.

The look to each other.

INT. HAL'S HOUSE - OLIVER'S ROOM - NIGHT

He gets up, works his way through the dark house. Turning on

lights.

INT. HAL'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Hal's awake, he's taken down dozens of books from a wall to

wall bookshelf. A huge physical task. MARIA a nurse is with

him. Oliver's dumbfounded.

INT. HAL'S OFFICE

Oliver and Hal are sitting at either side of his desk, Arthur

is in hal's lap. The sound from last scene bleeds over...

Hal looks sick but energized, he shuffles his desk of papers.

Oliver can only sit and worry.

INT. OLIVER'S OFFICE - DAY

GINSBERG'S READING CONTINUES OVER: Oliver flips through a

mock-up he made for "The Sads" - it's all the happy faces

from 1950's advertising that we saw in the last scene. One

face per-panel.

LATER: the three members of "The Sads" and a RECORD COMPANY

REP arrive. Jelly Roll Morton piano plays, we see but do not

hear the meeting take place. The Sads look at the designs,

which include many of the "History Of Sadness" drawings we

have seen now in CD cover format - and no portraits of the

band. It's clear that The Sads are not into Oliver's work.

CUT TO: After the meeting, the RECORD COMPANY REP talks to

Oliver alone.

Oliver's very disappointed but polite.

INT. HAL'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Oliver walks into Hal's living room, carrying his full tray

of medication.

Hal begins taking his many pills, with each one he pings his

glass with a teaspoon as he swallows. The room is cluttered

with books. Oliver picks up a toppling pile of files from a

paper-filled side table.

Oliver begins to neaten a messy pile of books on top of a

chair.

Hal gets up and walks to the kitchen, his oxygen cannon cord

is attached to the pump behind him, stopping him short.

Hal pulls off the oxygen and keeps walking, frail but

determined. Andy enters with a large pilates ball.

Oliver can't believe it.

Hal's still heading to the sink.

Andy walks out, Hal pours water into a kettle, in front of

him on the window sill is the same vase from the first scene

of the film, with some dead daisies in it.

Oliver looks at them frustrated and uneasy...

INT. STAPLES - DAY

Oliver and Hal walk amongst all the products. Hal wears his

portable oxygen and grabs different kinds of papers, dumping

them in the basket Oliver holds.

They're in a new isle, Hal continues his march.

Hal, continues on, avoiding looking at Oliver.

Oliver's flabbergasted, but his dad's vulnerability is clear

to him.

INT. HAL'S GUEST HOUSE - DAY

Andy's on an elliptical trainer, through a window we can see

Oliver approaching with the weight of the world on his

shoulders. Andy see's him, can immediately sense that

something is wrong.

Oliver approaches seriously, this makes Andy nervous, he

stops his workout. Oliver tries to find his words.

Oliver's blown away by the logic.

Andy's relieved he got this off his chest, all tension is

relieved for him, Oliver is just confused.

Andy gives Oliver a big sweaty hug. Oliver leaves.

with dread. Oliver looks at her, he finally moves to pick it

up.

It keeps ringing.

They both watch the phone as it rings and stops.

She picks up the phone, and gestures for Oliver to pick up

the line next to him.

She gestures again, Oliver picks up the phone on his side of

the bed. Anna turns away, he can only see her back across the

bed. He turns away too.

Anna continues to talk in a different voice.

Oliver breaks role, turns around looks at her.

She just looks at him. Back into phone.

They hang up. She's embarrassed, she lightens the mood to get

out of this intimacy.

She tosses a pillow over his face and pretends to shoot him

twice. She pulls the pillow back tentatively, he's smiling.

It's the last question she thought he'd ask. She's amused.

EXT. LOS ANGELES STREETS/INT. CAR - NIGHT

Anna, Oliver, Elliott, Shauna and Arthur drive up Sunset

Blvd. They arrive at Alvarado, park and get out. Above them a

well lit large blank/white billboard. As Oliver and Elliott

get spray paint cans from the back of the car...

EXT. ROOFTOP

The gang get to the top of the stairs, on to the roof where

they can see the large blank billboard towering in front of

them.

Oliver leaves Arthur with her, and Anna and Elliott and him

head off to the billboard. They climb it's structure, it's

high and a bit scary. On the top is a gang plank looking over

the city. Anna is happy she came. Elliott goes to paint the

back side of the billboard. Oliver meets up with Anna, over

looking the city.

Oliver walks out and writes big letters across the billboard.

YOU MAKE ME LAUGH BUT IT'S NOT FUNNY.

He makes his way back. Anna's not where she was, he looks and

finds her in the gangways between the two billboards with a

view to downtown below her.

He comes to her, wanting to get beyond the romance somehow.

She walks to him and puts her hands around his head, somehow

it's more intimate and vulnerable now.

They kiss.

MOMENTS LATER. They're at the bottom of the ladder. They all

run back to their car.

INT. ANNA'S HOTEL - NIGHT

Oliver, Anna and Arthur walk down the hallway. Arthur bolts

ahead suddenly, getting free of Oliver, he runs to and OLD

MAN - wearing all black and looking just like Hal. Oliver

runs up to stop Arthur.

We see the old man's face, it's not Hal, but it the

resemblance hits Oliver too. The man is struggling with his

hotel key card.

Oliver swipes the man's key, the door opens.

He disappears. Oliver looks overwhelmed by this ghost. Anna

senses what's happened. She leads Oliver to their room.

INT. ANNA'S ROOM - NIGHT

Oliver sits on the bed, sinking. Anna watches him. She comes

to him, hugs him.

She wants to take care of him, she lays him back on the bed,

him - Oliver is overwhelmed by memory.

EXT. ANDY'S HOUSE - DAY

Oliver arrives at Andy's door. Andy answers, Arthur's jumps

up to see Oliver.

Oliver picks him up, he gets all of Arthur's stuff, he's a

little cold to Andy.

Oliver stops and looks back.

Oliver falters, not know how to say it, then...

This hits Andy hard. Oliver turns to leave but can't. He

turns back, goes to Andy and they hug.

INT. OLIVER'S BEDROOM

Oliver and Arthur arrive, happy and relieved, Oliver jumps on

his bed and Arthur follows.

INT. OLIVER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

Oliver opens the front door to Anna.

She's a bit tentative, but she's here and happy.

Arthur runs up and Anna bends down to greet him. They missed

each other.

Anna walks in and Oliver follows.

She heads to the dinning room.

Oliver laughs nervously. In the dining room, Hal's old boxes

are still stacked along the walls. Oliver leans forward and

pulls something out of a box.

She looks at a personal ad application, with the picture of

Hal in the open jean jacket we saw at the beginning of the

film.

CUT TO PAST

We see REPEAT SHOTS of Hal, and in every shot he's looking at

camera. Hal telling Oliver he's gay, Hal napping with Andy

and waving at Oliver, Hal after Juan put in his hair mousse

looking at Oliver, Hal showing Oliver his radiation tatoo...

MORE REPEAT SHOTS: Hal with Andy at the L.A. Pride picnic,

Hal playing with Arthur on his couch.

CUT BACK TO THE PRESENT

Oliver finishes reading for her.

They both smile.

She looks at the photo again.

They look at each other, more vulnerable and willing than

we've seen them.

INT. OLIVER'S HALLWAY

Anna walks down the hallway, Oliver follows her.

INT. OLIVER'S BEDROOM

Anna and Oliver sit side by side on his bed.

They look at each other, they smile.
