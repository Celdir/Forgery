MRS BROWN BY JEREMY BROCK

EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT

Begin on black.  The sound of rain driving into trees.

Something wipes frame and we are suddenly hurtling through

a forest on the shoulders of a wild-eyed, kilted JOHN

BROWN.  Drenched hair streaming, head swivelling left and

right, as he searches the lightening-dark.  A crack to his

left.  He spins round, raises his pistol, smacks past

saplings and plunges on.

EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT

Close-up on BROWN as he bangs against a tree and heaves for

air.  A face in its fifties, mad-fierce eyes, handsome,

bruised lips, liverish.  He goes on searching the dark.

Stops.  Listens through the rain.  A beat.  Thinking he

hears a faint thump in the distance, he swings round and

races on.

EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT

BROWN tears through the trees, pistol raised at full arm's

length, breath coming harder and harder.  But even now

there's a ghost grace, a born hunter's grace.  He leaps

fallen branches, swerves through turns in the path, eyes

forward, never stumbling once.

EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT

BROWN bursts into a clearing, breaks to the centre and

stops.  With his pistol raised, he turns one full slow

circle.  His eyes take in every swerve and kick of the

wildly swaying trees.

There's a crack and a branch snaps behind him.  He spins

round, bellows deep from his heart:

And fires.

Nothing happens.  The trees go on swaying, the storm goes

on screaming and BROWN just stands there, staring into

empty space.  A pause.

Slowly, he starts to frown as the fact begins to dawn on

him that he is alone.  He stares at the thrashing trees,

waving their mocking arms at him.  His hand lets the pistol

drop to his side.  He feels the rain drench down his face.

And now, for the first time, we see that his socks have

fallen to his ankles and his knees are cut to shreds.  He

shifts a foot.  His dress-shoes are covered in mud.  He

goes on staring into the dark.  Nothing.

Just the wind and rain.  Gradually, we pull back, higher

and higher.  As we do, we hear the quiet cultivated voice:

CAPTION: "1864"

John BROWN is now just a tiny figure dwarfed by the storm.

INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN VICTORIA'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY

The screen is black.  As the camera pulls back, we discover

that we are looking at a black night-gown.

Queen VICTORIA is sitting at her dressing table, while an

elderly HAIRDRESSER, also in black, works at her hair.

INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, PRINCE ALBERT'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY

A bust of the Prince Consort is draped in black.  His desk

is laid out as if for work.  A VALET is brushing one of his

suits before laying it carefully on the bed.

Close-up on a small table as a shaving brush is placed

carefully beside a dish of freshly poured water.

INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN VICTORIA'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY

The hairdresser is pulling VICTORIA's hair back into the

widow's cape.  For the first time, we see her face.  It is

set in a mask of severity.

INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN VICTORIA'S BEDCHAMBER - DAY

A bronze cast of Prince Albert's hand hangs above the Royal

bed.  His sleeping-gown is laid out on one side.

A somberly dressed middle-aged man stands by the bed:

DOCTOR JENNER, the Queen's physician.  He is placing

potions and medicaments in a row on the bedside table.

Behind him, TWO MAIDSERVANTS are busy stripping and

remaking the bed while another raises the window to air the

room.

INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN VICTORIA'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY

VICTORIA is turning slowly around as a young ASSISTANT

DRESSER completes the fastening on her black crepe dress.

The assistant dresser pulls too tightly on her dress.

VICTORIA winces slightly.

EXT. THE SEA FRONT, ISLE OF WIGHT - DAY

We glide slowly past the coastline as a caption reads:

"ISLE OF WIGHT. 1864."

A DRIVER stands against the sea front with a horse and cart

bearing the Royal coat of arms.

John BROWN leads his pony along the dockside, towards the

waiting driver.  He is in his late thirties, fit, handsome

and dressed in tartan kilt and short jacket.

INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, PRIVATE SECRETARY'S ROOM - DAY

SIR HENRY PONSONBY, the Queen's Private Secretary, is

sitting at his writing desk, completing a letter.

He folds the letter and slips it into an envelope.  He is a

middle-aged man in a dark mourning suit; tall, Saturnine

and with a civil servant's stoop.  As he looks up, we see a

white-stockinged FOOTMAN standing to attention by the door.

PONSONBY hands the letter to him.

CAPTION: "OSBORNE HOUSE, ISLE OF WIGHT"

INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, CORRIDOR AND QUEEN'S DINING ROOM - DAY

A series of windows are being slammed open by white

stockinged FOOTMEN as members of the ROYAL FAMILY and UPPER

HOUSEHOLD hurry by in silence, all dressed in mourning and

rushing to make the luncheon hour.

INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN'S DRAWING ROOM - DAY

Queen VICTORIA heads down the empty corridor with two

ladies-in-waiting, LADY ELY and LADY CHURCHILL, hurrying

along a pace behind.

INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN'S DINING ROOM - DAY

Members of the Royal family and upper household hurry into

the icy dining room and take their designated places at the

luncheon table.  Everybody is dressed in mourning and

nobody speaks.  Wind whistles through the open windows.

Silence.

Among the diners we catch our first glimpse of BERTIE, the

Prince of Wales.  He is in his mid-twenties, plump, stiff

dressed and balding.  He stands next to his young wife,

PRINCESS ALEXANDRA, who fiddles nervously with her shawl,

trying to keep warm.

As BERTIE smooths down his thinning hair, DOCTOR JENNER

bustles into the dining room, stands himself next to

PONSONBY and proceeds to conduct a hurried conversation

with the Prince of Wales, entirely in whispers.

EXT. DOCKSIDE, ISLE OF WIGHT - DAY

JOHN BROWN leads his pony gently up the ramp and into the

carrier bearing the Royal coat of arms.  The DRIVER leans

in.

BROWN looks straight at this man, quiet and reserved.

The DRIVER shrugs and slams the doors on them.

INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, CORRIDOR AND QUEEN'S DINING ROOM - DAY

VICTORIA reaches the dining room door and takes a deep

breath.  LADY ELY and LADY CHURCHILL stop a pace behind.

LADY ELY is slightly taken aback.

VICTORIA closes her eyes, then steels herself and steps

through the door.

INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN'S DINING ROOM - DAY

Everyone stiffens as VICTORIA walks in.  Acknowledging the

other diners with a quick nod, the Queen takes her place.

She flaps open her napkin and, bang on cue, everyone else

sits and does the same.  The meal is served immediately by

waiting SERVANTS, who plonk the food down without ceremony.

It's a very ordinary meal of meat and vegetables.  VICTORIA

starts eating heartily, straight away.  Everyone does the

same.

Only the clink of cutlery and the same eerie silence.

EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE, THE GROUNDS - DAY

The Royal horse-carrier rattles into the grounds and on

down the driveway past the beautiful, manicured lawns

stretching away towards the ornate twin towers of Osborne

House.  A few outdoor servants watch its progress

curiously.

INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN'S DINING ROOM - DAY

The silence continues as VICTORIA finishes her plain

pudding.  Immediately, servants appear at every place and

whip away the pudding bowls whether their owners have

finished or not.  Nobody thinks this odd; it is part of the

routine.  DOCTOR JENNER clears his throat.

A beat.  VICTORIA takes a sip of water, dabs her mouth with

her napkin and rises.  Everyone else rises too.  Suddenly,

the Queen turns to Bertie's nervous wife, PRINCESS

ALEXANDRA, and proclaims abruptly:

VICTORIA nods earnestly.  Lost to the effect her words have

had, she marches out again.  Behind her, she leaves

PRINCESS ALEXANDRA feeling humiliated and crestfallen in

front of all the others.  BERTIE takes her hand and

squeezes tight, trying awkwardly to console.

EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE - DAY

The horse-carrier pulls up outside the servant's entrance

and the DRIVER opens the doors.

JOHN BROWN pulls out a watch from his waistcoat and checks

the time.  His eyes narrow critically.

INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, CORRIDOR - DAY

A few minutes later, JOHN BROWN strides down the long

corridor with PONSONBY at his side.  Their journey takes

them down an endless series of corridors, past servants and

householders hurrying about their duties.  The presence of

the dead Albert is felt all around in the black-wreathed

portraits and busts that crop up along the way.

BROWN and PONSONBY could not be more contrasted.

A beat.

PONSONBY stiffens.  A beat.

BROWN takes the measure of him.

BROWN glances up the corridor.

PONSONBY refuses to acknowledge what he has heard.  They

reach the door of the Royal Chamber and he concludes the

interview.

BROWN refuses to answer, so PONSONBY knocks.  After a

moment, the door is opened by LADY ELY who ushers them in.

INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN'S SITTING ROOM - DAY

BROWN walks stiffly into the room and stops.  PONSONBY

waits by the door.

VICTORIA is bent over the desk, working at one of her

numerous red boxes.  She scribbles furiously at a letter,

underlining and accenting words as she goes.  Finally, LADY

ELY steps up to her side and whispers something in her ear.

She carries on working.

BROWN has time to survey the room.  Dominating everything

are the same black-wreathed busts and portraits of Prince

Albert glimpsed in the corridor.

Finally, VICTORIA nods and LADY ELY beckons BROWN forward.

He steps up in front of the desk and waits.  VICTORIA looks

up and BROWN bows deeply.

Silence.

She stares at him for a long moment without apparently

registering who he is.  He towers over her, in bright

tartan, while she sits hunched in her seat, all in black

and knotted with tension.

Finally, she finds her voice.  She sounds nervous and edgy.

VICTORIA blinks at the sight of him.  His presence is

bringing him back.  A beat.

In an effort to control her emotions, VICTORIA now sounds

the same severe note as at lunch.  But BROWN, unlike

others, seems unaffected.

Silence.  VICTORIA starts to tire.  She takes a sip of

water and spills a little on herself.  Flustered, she

searches for a hanky but cannot find one.  LADY ELY hurries

up with one of her own and the Queen dabs it off.  BROWN

watches all of this with genuine concern.  When VICTORIA

finally looks up, he stares at her in deep sympathy.

VICTORIA stares back in stunned silence.  PONSONBY coughs

involuntarily.  LADY ELY freezes.  A beat.

Suddenly, BROWN finds himself tugged backwards out of the

room.  LADY ELY rushes up to assist as VICTORIA shouts

herself into a fit of uncontrolled sobbing.

INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, BROWN'S QUARTERS - DAY

Some minutes later, BROWN is angrily unpacking a trunk.

His humiliation expresses itself in the extraordinary

ferocity with which he slams down every object.

His younger brother, ARCHIE, sits on the bed.  He's in his

early thirties, bright, sharp and dressed in the same

distinctive kilt and tweed.

BROWN stares back, still pissed off.

BROWN slams a drawer shut.  ARCHIE lets it go and watches

his brother.  A beat.

A beat, then both men burst out laughing.

INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, SERVANT'S HALL - DAY

The clatter of voices and banging doors as under servants

hurry about with plates, knives and forks, laying the Upper

Servant's huge table for dinner.  ARCHIE leads BROWN

through this rush of activity.

BROWN smiles dryly.  They pour themselves a drink from the

table.

Hold on BROWN.  He lets it go and moves on.  Across the

hall, he spots the pretty ASSISTANT DRESSER watching them.

A beat.  BROWN stares straight at him.

INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, UPPER CORRIDOR - MORNING

The next day, VICTORIA and her ladies are hurrying down a

corridor on her way into the dining room.  VICTORIA

suddenly stops and stares out of the windows.  Her

entourage are several steps past her before they realize

what's happened and scurry back to take up their positions

behind.

Now we see what has caught her attention.  BROWN is

standing in the courtyard below, by his pony.  She watches

him for a moment, then without reacting, walks on.

EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE - AFTERNOON

Some hours later.  It is now raining.

A gaggle of ROYAL GRANDCHILDREN hurry out of a carriage

from their afternoon recreational while their NANNIES

frantically try to keep them dry under the umbrellas.  John

BROWN stands tall and erect on the gravel while they rush

around him, laughing and giggling.

INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, UPPER CORRIDOR - EVENING

Rain on the window.  VICTORIA is walking in the opposite

direction down the corridor with her entourage.  She stops

at the same place as before.

Lady Ely peers through the rain.

At this moment, PONSONBY comes down the corridor.

VICTORIA takes one last look and walks away.

INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, PRIVATE SECRETARY'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT

Half an hour later, PONSONBY stands at his desk facing

BROWN.

BROWN stares straight back.

INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, UPPER CORRIDOR - DAY

The next day.  From a high window, we see PONSONBY

scuttling madly across the courtyard towards the figure of

JOHN BROWN, who is standing exactly as he was the day

before.

VICTORIA watches impassively.

EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE, COURTYARD - DAY

PONSONBY stands close to BROWN, shouting in his face.

From the window above, VICTORIA takes in his words.  A

beat.  PONSONBY collects himself.

BROWN turns, grabs the lead rein and leads his horse back

to the stables.

INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, STABLES - DAY

A few minutes later, BROWN is in the process of stabling

his horse.  Suddenly he turns.

VICTORIA is standing at the far end of the stable with her

entourage.

A beat.

Silence.  The two of them stare at each other.

EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE, THE GROUNDS - DAY

The next day, high and wide over the stunningly manicured

landscape.  Long lawns, wind-cropped copses and in the

distance, the glittering sea.

EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE, THE GROUNDS - DAY

VICTORIA sits side-saddle on a horse.  BROWN leads her in

silence.

EXT. CLIFFTOP - DAY

VICTORIA looks up.

She stares ahead.

She stops abruptly, but BROWN cuts in.

She stops again, cutting quickly back to small-talk.

A pause.

BROWN walks up to her side, opens the saddle bag and hands

her a bundle of letters held together with ribbon.

BROWN undoes the ribbon and tries again.  VICTORIA cuts in.

BROWN takes off the top letter and hands it to her.

INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, UPPER SERVANT'S TABLE - NIGHT

The clatter and crush of the Upper Servant's table as UPPER

SERVANTS sit themselves down to dinner while UNDER SERVANTS

prepare to serve soup.

ARCHIE comes in and sits himself somewhere in the middle

next to an empty seat.  A moment later, BROWN strides in.

But instead of sitting at the place beside his brother, he

goes straight to the head of the table and plonks himself

down.  Slowly, the clatter dies away as the whole room

stops and stares at him in silence.  BROWN fixes them with

a look.

An elderly butler steps into the room and stares in

amazement at BROWN.  A smooth young man, BERTIE'S VALET,

hurries up to intercede.

A little frisson of oh-my-gawdness.  BERTIE'S VALET stares

icily at him.

But as far as BERTIE'S VALET is concerned, it isn't.  He

stares down in mute fury, then snaps his fingers at one of

the under servants, who rushes over.  There is a hurried

exchange of whispers before the under servant rushes out.

Unperturbed, BROWN brings out his flask and pours himself a

substantial draft of whiskey.  He turns to the pretty

assistant dresser, sitting to his right.

She blinks nervously at him.

BROWN tucks into his soup.  Everyone watches and waits.

The assistant dresser thinks for a moment.

BROWN nods.  All conversation stops as the under servant

bursts back in.  She halts at the door, looking blankly

from Bertie's valet to the elderly butler.  A beat.  The

old man stiffens and makes his way to the middle of the

table.

BROWN looks up from his soup.

With a clatter of spoons, everyone obediently eats.

INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, DRAWING ROOM - DAY

A few days later.  A morning "drawing room."  Standing

round the unlit fireplace are DOCTOR JENNER, LADY ELY, LADY

CHURCHILL, the two LADIES IN WAITING and PRINCESS

ALEXANDRA.  All are dressed against the icy wind that

whistles through the open window where VICTORIA sits

knitting busily while BERTIE stands beside her, coat

buttoned up to the collar.  PONSONBY has stationed himself

opposite, beside a desk piled high with red dispatch boxes.

He runs through the daily itinerary.

A beat.  BERTIE watches closely now.  PONSONBY coughs

again, nervous.

VICTORIA stiffens.  She speaks without turning.

PONSONBY gives up.  Politely, but firmly, BERTIE takes up

the reins.

VICTORIA carries on knitting.

VICTORIA looks up sharply.

An appalled silence.  With great dignity, BERTIE absorbs

the shock of the insult and quietly steers the conversation

in another direction.

Silence.  VICTORIA has crossed to the window and stares out

at the view.  Having recovered her composure, she turns to

address them all.

For a moment, nobody believes what they have heard.  She

continues.

Bertie stares at her in silence while PONSONBY and DOCTOR

JENNER exchange a worried look.

EXT. PRIVATE BEACH, ISLE OF WIGHT - DAY

The doors of the Royal bathing-machine swing open and Queen

VICTORIA, in a voluminous swim-dress, sails out like a duck

into the freezing sea.  As she does so, the doors of the

other machines open and Princess Helena and Princess Louise

follow her in.  Dignity does not allow them to shout out,

but their expressions of constipated agony are a picture.

VICTORIA begins swimming around in a vigorous little

circle.

Hold for a moment on the princesses' miserable faces.

EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE - DAY

Half an hour later, PONSONBY, DOCTOR JENNER, LADY ELY and

two FOOTMEN watch as BROWN helps VICTORIA up some steps and

onto her horse.  He glances at the stiff line of

householders and mutters curtly to himself.

The household do not hear this, but QUEEN VICTORIA has

overheard and tries to suppress a smile.

As she settles into the saddle, her foot comes loose.

BROWN fastens it into the stirrups.

Everyone hears this.  VICTORIA obeys.  Taking the reins, he

then walks the QUEEN out of the courtyard.  As they vanish

from site, we hear...

CAPTION: "1866"

INT. THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT - DAY

The speech continues as we follow the progress of a

Tomahawk cartoon doing the rounds of the Tory back benches

from knee to knee.  It is entitled, "Where is Britannia?"

and shows an empty throne draped with the Royal cloak.

During the above, the cartoon reaches the front benches and

lands on the knees of the young, earnest STANLEY.  As he

frowns at the picture in front of him, DISRAELI winds up.

During this peroration, we see DISRAELI for the first time.

He is handsome, obviously Jewish and wire thin, like

Dickens on Slimfast.  He dresses almost dandyishly but

speaks with startling vigor; a combination of brilliance

and cheek that is his key.  To cheers from his back

benchers, he sits.

As he looks up, he catches the eye of his opposite on the

Liberal benches.  GLADSTONE is different in almost every

respect; dour, dogged, heavy-set and tall.  They stare

levelly for a second, then DISRAELI flashes a brilliant

smile.

STANLEY plops the cartoon on his lap.

INT. THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT, LOBBY CORRIDOR - DAY

A few minutes later, DISRAELI and STANLEY are strolling

down the busy lobby corridor.  Throughout their talk, Tory

back-benchers bustle up to pat their hero on the back and

offer their congratulations.

The pass GLADSTONE in a huddle of cohorts.

DISRAELI sweeps through a prattle of back-benchers.

EXT. PUBLIC BEACH, ISLE OF WIGHT - DAY

BROWN and ARCHIE crash into the water.  It is freezing.

BROWN braces himself against the icy shallows by bellowing

Burns at the sea.

ARCHIE is so creased up with laughing, he almost drowns.

EXT. PUBLIC BEACH, ISLE OF WIGHT - DAY

A few minutes later, BROWN and ARCHIE hurry back up the

cold beach to rub themselves dry.  BROWN is very energized.

BROWN takes a nip of whiskey and offers some to his

brother.

ARCHIE stares at him.  A beat.

EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - NIGHT

A few days later.

The clatter of carriage and horse as the ROYAL PARTY

thunders through gathering dark toward Balmoral Castle.

CAPTION: "BALMORAL"

EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - TWILIGHT

A mass of torches encircle the ROYAL PARTY as kilted

GHILLIES and STAFF swarm round the carriage, opening doors

and clambering off boxes while a regiment of PIPERS play

them in.

Amid this swarm of activity, we glimpse BROWN opening the

door to a smiling VICTORIA as she climbs down, followed by

PRINCESS HELENA and PRINCESS LOUISE.  Emerging from another

carriage come BERTIE and PRINCESS ALEXANDRA, staring grim

faced at the castle.  HENRY PONSONBY and DOCTOR JENNER

alight from their carriage as PONSONBY slips on his gloves

and pinches his nose at the pain of remembrance.

EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY

The next day.

High over the vast, bleak mountains of Lochnager and Loch

Muick.  VICTORIA and BROWN are riding fast towards the top.

Reaching the summit, VICTORIA points excitedly at the far

horizon.

BROWN lets it go and they ride on.

The stare at each other until BROWN kicks his horse on.

BROWN lowers his head.

BROWN says nothing.

Taking a sprig of heather from her brooch, VICTORIA holds

it out to him.  A beat.

INT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY

A few days later, PONSONBY, DOCTOR JENNER and BROWN stand

at the chamber-desk, talking over the Queen's itinerary.

BROWN snaps together his papers and walks out, leaving

PONSONBY and DOCTOR JENNER standing lamely at the table.

EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY

The next morning.  The ROYAL FAMILY are picnicking in the

grounds.  VICTORIA walks along a path accompanied on one

side by BROWN, on the other by BERTIE.

BERTIE is in mid-plea.

Before Bertie can continue, BROWN steps right into his

face.

BERTIE stares back, too stunned to speak.  He glances at

his mother, but VICTORIA looks off into the distance as if

she has not heard.  BERTIE turns and storms away.

INT. ESTATE COTTAGE, BALMORAL - DAY

JOHN BROWN is standing in the doorway of a small cottage

watching, with amused detachment, as a middle-aged couple,

MR and MRS GRANT, race about their tiny living room, trying

desperately to make it presentable for the Queen's sudden

visit.  They fling open the windows, slosh water on the

fire, tidy up their two grubby BOYS, plump up the cushions,

dump knitting under the sofa and try to smarten themselves

up, all in the space of a few seconds.

MRS GRANT surveys the room critically.

EXT. ESTATE COTTAGE, BALMORAL - DAY

VICTORIA sits on a horse and trap.  BROWN steps out and

helps her down.

INT. ESTATE COTTAGE, BALMORAL - DAY

VICTORIA steps in to be greeted by all four GRANTS in one

military row, smoke still steaming off the fire.  BROWN

stands behind her, barely able to contain himself.  But for

VICTORIA, it is all she's ever known and so she takes it as

perfectly normal.

MR GRANT remembers himself and gestures VICTORIA towards a

chair.

From his place by the wall, BROWN notices how easily she

smiles as she is led to the chair.  She points to a picture

on the wall and her good humour is infectious.

INT. A SOCIETY PARTY, LONDON - DAY

A few days later, a party of ARISTOCRATS, MINISTERS,

DIPLOMATS, ESCORTS, BUSINESSMAN and WHORES.  Into this

brouhaha come DISRAELI, his elderly wife MARY ANNE and the

young STANLEY.  It is all eyes and nods here.  Everyone

knows everyone.

Across the room, STANLEY spots BERTIE amid a crowd of

acolytes.

STANLEY smiles faintly.  DISRAELI homes in on a punter and

raises his hand, already working the room.

INT. A SOCIETY PARTY, LONDON - DAY

The society party is hotting up.  STANLEY is deep in

conversation with three SOCIETY LADIES.

A peal of naughty laughter.  Unseen, DISRAELI steps up.

The SOCIETY LADY stares blankly back.

DISRAELI stares at her steadily, already thinking ahead.

INT. ESTATE COTTAGE, BALMORAL - DAY

BROWN stands by a wall, smiling to himself at the sight of

QUEEN VICTORIA struggling to help lay the table while MRS

GRANT nervously prattles on.

MRS GRANT scurries away.  VICTORIA immediately holds up the

spoons to BROWN with a questioning look -- above or beside

the plate?  He nods her to the top and she quickly carries

on.

INT. A SOCIETY PARTY, LONDON - DAY

DISRAELI and MARY ANNE stand with BERTIE and his ACOLYTES.

DISRAELI shakes hands with the fat sugar tycoon who wobbles

with drink.  MARY ANNE engages him in conversation while

BERTIE turns DISRAELI aside.

A beat.

DISRAELI nods and BERTIE walks swiftly back to his party.

The moment he's gone, STANLEY steps up to DISRAELI's side.

INT. ESTATE COTTAGE, BALMORAL - DAY

VICTORIA, BROWN and the GRANTS are eating around a large

table.  Like a wife watching her husband, VICTORIA beams

proudly at BROWN as he tells a story.

For a split second, both the GRANTS look petrified, then

BROWN and VICTORIA explode into laughter and the GRANTS

relax.  Suddenly the GRANTS are helpless with laughter too.

Beginning with VICTORIA's glass, BROWN pours out liberal

quantities of whiskey all round.

EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DUSK

Later that night, the courtyard is packed with a gaggle of

worried HOUSEHOLDERS holding lamps.

Through the light, BROWN and VICTORIA clatter into the

courtyard on the horse and trap.  DOCTOR JENNER breaks

through the crowd in a state of high excitement.

BROWN cannot resist one more little dig.

VICTORIA smiles and BROWN lifts her off the trap.  Before

walking in she turns and, in front of everyone, says...

BROWN bows and the QUEEN walks on.  As she straightens up,

he finds PONSONBY and DOCTOR JENNER staring back at him in

utter disbelief at what she has just said.  He turns and

leads the horse back to the stables.

PONSONBY doesn't answer.  He is watching BROWN very

closely.

Silence.  JENNER turns to look at PONSONBY.

PONSONBY's face is set hard.

INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, BALLROOM - NIGHT

A crush of kilted GHILLIES as we slam into the height of

the annual Ghillie's Ball.

The whole court is reeling through the dance; all of them

beholding the extraordinary spectacle of QUEEN VICTORIA and

JOHN BROWN dancing together in the middle of the hall.

PONSONBY and JENNER stand by the wall, watching.  Close-up

on PONSONBY'S face as JENNER mutters darkly.

With a slam of feet the reel ends, the GHILLIES roar and

BROWN and VICTORIA stand smiling at each other in silence.

A King and his Queen.

INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, BALLROOM - NIGHT

Later that night.

We find BROWN, slouched on the ground, dead-drunk and

snoring loudly.

EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY

A few days later, four JOURNALISTS are scrabbling up a

stony path, armed with telescopes.

EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY

A large ROYAL PARTY is making its way smoothly and quietly

up the mountain.  BROWN is on horseback, leading VICTORIA

on a dapple-grey.

EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY

The JOURNALISTS rattle up the hill.

EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY

BROWN and VICTORIA start pulling ahead of the main party.

EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY

The JOURNALISTS scramble up to some gorse bushes, dump

themselves down and start setting up the telescopes.

EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY

BROWN and VICTORIA near the summit when BROWN suddenly

stops.  He stiffens and turns to face the wind, as if

catching a scent.  VICTORIA frowns.

BROWN's eyes fix on some distant gorse bushes.

He dismounts and races off.

EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY

The JOURNALISTS are peering through their telescopes.

Below them, BROWN races across the riverbank and

undergrowth, unseen.

BROWN rears up above them and stops.

The JOURNALISTS scramble to their feet and start legging it

down the hill, while BROWN roars furiously, hurling their

bags after them.

The JOURNALISTS vanish below the hillside.

INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, UPPER SERVANT'S TABLE - NIGHT

That night.

BROWN is standing at the head of the table, yelling at the

UPPER SERVANTS, irrespective of ARCHIE or anyone.

ARCHIE glances up at BERTIE'S VALET.  He is staring down at

the table, teeth gritted, fists clenched.  BROWN rounds on

them all again.

BERTIE'S VALET stares at him in astonishment.  BROWN turns

back to the table.

There is a general mutter of assent.  BROWN turns and

storms out as ARCHIE gets up to follow.

INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, HENRY PONSONBY'S ROOMS - DAY

A few days later, PONSONBY is sitting at his desk, hands to

his hips, listening quietly as DOCTOR JENNER reads from his

copy of Punch.

INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, LOWER CORRIDOR - DAY

BROWN crashes through a door holding a copy of the same

journal.

INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, CORRIDOR - DAY

BROWN storms up to PONSONBY's door.

INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, HENRY PONSONBY'S ROOMS - DAY

BROWN bursts in on PONSONBY and JENNER, slamming down his

copy of Punch on the desk.  He is furious but controlled.

BROWN stares at him in silence.  A beat.

CAPTION: "1867"

INT. THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT - DAY

Chaos.  The Tories are losing the vote as both sides of the

house stand and shout at each other while the SPEAKER rises

in his chair.

A buzzing silence settles as the house sits for the vote.

The COUNTERS approach the chair.

A murmur of excitement from the LIBERALS.

A beat.

By the time he reaches "sixty-five" his voice is drowned in

cheers from the Liberal benches.  DISRAELI and the rest of

the front bench sit in stony silence.

Somewhere on the Liberal back benches, a wild-eyed

maverick, DILKE, rises to his feet shouting:

A roar from the irate TORIES and chaos reigns again.

INT. THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT, LOBBY CORRIDOR - NIGHT

An hour later the house is empty except for a few

straggling MPs hurrying home.  An exhausted DISRAELI stands

in the corridor with STANLEY.

The elderly prelate, DEAN WELLSELLY, hurries in through the

lobby doors.  DISRAELI puts on a welcoming smile.

DISRAELI opens the copy of Punch and hands it to Dean

Wellselly.  The Dean clears his throat and starts to read.

Dean Wellselly looks up from the article, horrified.

DEAN WELLSELLY nods his head gravely.  Over his shoulder,

STANLEY is gaping at DISRAELI's silky distortion of the

party political maneuver into a moral imperative.

DISRAELI interrupts.

Silence.  DEAN WELLSELLY'S face is a picture of

unrestrained horror.  Low-church.  Presbyterian.

INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, QUEEN'S DRAWING ROOM - DAY

Some days later.

Queen VICTORIA sits at her desk while Henry PONSONBY stands

in front of her, holding a copy of The Times.

PONSONBY coughs once and begins again.

VICTORIA glowers at him.

Suddenly, VICTORIA's temper goes and she shouts at him.

She looks up, eyes blazing.

INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, ROOM ADJOINING DRAWING ROOM - DAY

BROWN is guarding the door to the drawing room while the

balding BERTIE muscles up, eye ball to eye ball.

A split-second.  BERTIE gapes at him.

A beat.

Foolishly, BERTIE tries to barge his way past.  Suddenly

BROWN loses it completely.  He grabs the Prince of Wales by

the shoulders and pins him back, shouting right into his

face.

For a split-second, BROWN's eyes flicker as he senses he

has gone too far.  A look of pure venom in BERTIE'S face,

then ...

EXT. WINDSOR CASTLE, QUADRANGLE - NIGHT

Weeks later.

In a roar of hooves and wheels, the Royal Carriage sweeps

into the huge quadrangle.  JOHN BROWN stands rigid on the

box, glowering at all the world.

CAPTION: "WINDSOR"

INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, SERVANT'S CORRIDOR - NIGHT

A pair of doors open out onto a torchlit driveway as a mass

of SERVANTS rush in and out, ferrying bags an trunks.

BROWN marches in, still charged-up from the strain of the

journey's watchfulness.  He spots an UNDER-PORTER snatching

a break.

The UNDER-PORTER scrambles up the stairs.  A few SERVANTS

exchange looks.  BROWN seems more determined than ever to

exert his control.

EXT. WINDSOR CASTLE, STABLES - NIGHT

That night.

Carrying an old storm lamp high over his head, BROWN walks

towards the stables.

EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE - DAY

The next day.

BROWN is on horseback, riding with VICTORIA through the

grounds.  He is still jumpy, eyes flicking left and right,

searching for intruders.  They are being followed at a

distance by two EQUERRIES on horseback.  VICTORIA frowns

peevishly.

BROWN doesn't react.  A beat.

BROWN chucks his horse on, bringing a firm halt to the

conversation.  A beat.  He pulls up suddenly, staring at

the shadows in the copse.

He stares for along moment and then lets it go.

INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, STABLES - NIGHT

BROWN marches down the line of horse boxes.  A stable-lad,

BARNEY, is feeding the horses.  He looks twitchy.

Reaching his pony, BROWN stops and smiles.  The animal

lifts its face to him and he softly strokes his muzzle.

BARNEY twitches again and BROWN realizes too late.  The

split-second he turns, he sees THREE MEN.

The MEN pile onto him and he collapses under their weight.

As he falls, BROWN manages to yank himself round, bang up a

fist and fling the others off him.  But the FIRST MAN is up

again, twisting an arm round his neck and tugging him back.

The others grapple his arms down, but BROWN is incredibly

strong.  Even now, grunting and scrabbling, he makes them

fight to force him back.  BARNEY stands transfixed in

horror.

Dumping BROWN against the wall, the men step back and start

kicking the shit out of him.  BROWN curls into a ball, jaw

locked, hands over his head.  Not a sound.

Finally, they back off, panting hard.  The FIRST MAN pulls

out a bottle of whiskey, yanks back BROWN's head and forces

whiskey down his throat.  It spills over his face and

dribbles down his neck.

INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, QUEEN'S SITTING ROOM - DAY

The next day.

VICTORIA is standing at the windows.  The door opens and

LADY ELY walks in.

VICTORIA walks away and steps behind her desk.

LADY ELY bows and walks out.  VICTORIA stares at the desk a

moment, then picks up her pen and tries to work.  She

cannot.

INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, BROWN'S QUARTERS - DAY

BROWN sits on the edge of the bed in only his

undergarments.  His face, arms, legs and fingers are livid

with bruises, but he sits there, stiff-backed and gritting

his teeth, while ARCHIE crouches in front of him, tending

to his wounds.

ARCHIE completes one of the dressings when BROWN suddenly

reaches back and starts trying to put on his shirt.

BROWN lunges for the bedside drawer and pulls out a card

showing a coy picture of a pretty woman.  He holds it up,

eyes blazing.

He reads out the inscription.

ARCHIE stares at him.

ARCHIE steps back but BROWN roars at him.

ARCHIE steps outside and BROWN is left alone.

INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, QUEEN'S SITTING ROOM - DAY

The next day.  VICTORIA sits at her desk.  PONSONBY hands

her letters to sign.

VICTORIA signs the last letter and sits back.

PONSONBY coughs.

PONSONBY does not reply.  Finally, VICTORIA is obliged to

ask.

VICTORIA stares through the window, expressionless.

INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, CHAPEL - DAY

VICTORIA walks through the ornate chapel, nervously

fingering her handkerchief.  Waiting for her, smiling

softly, is the Dean of Windsor, DEAN WELLSELLY.

She holds his eyes for a moment, then nods.

INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, CHAPEL - DAY

A few minutes later, VICTORIA and DEAN WELLSELLY are seated

in a corner of the chapel, talking softly.  She cannot

bring herself to look at him and so does not notice how

carefully he is watching her throughout the interview.

This is incredibly hard for her to say, but she struggles

to be as honest as possible.

She stops herself.  She is crying.  DEAN WELLSELLY watches

her a moment, then speaks close, choosing his words

carefully.

Silence.  VICTORIA stares into the long, dark chapel.

Gradually, as she takes in the tone of his remarks, her

disappointment turns to anger.

INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, QUEEN'S SITTING ROOM - DAY

The next day, VICTORIA stands at the far window and her

back to the room.  Lined up against the wall are BERTIE and

his siblings.

PONSONBY steps forward.

A beat.

They all file out.

EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE - DAY

A few days later.

BROWN and VICTORIA are riding on horseback.  Although

better than he was, BROWN'S face is still badly bruised.

They turn a corner banked by trees.  BROWN is watching the

QUEEN closely.  She stops.

Without a word, BROWN dismounts and helps her off her

horse.

A beat.

A beat.

She takes his hand to her mouth and kisses it gently, then

looks at him, utterly helpless.

A long silence.  BROWN holds her hand tight.

CAPTION: "1868"

EXT. LOWLANDS - DAY

A few weeks later.

A tiny horse-drawn carriage creeps across a huge Highland

landscape.

EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY

DISRAELI hurries through the pouring rain.

Reaching the castle, he hurries inside and the great doors

bang behind him.

INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, QUEEN'S DRAWING ROOM - DAY

The next day.

QUEEN VICTORIA is playing the piano like she walks, with

great vim and vigor.  The tune is some quaint Scottish

ballad which she belts out in her clear strong voice,

almost drowning out PRINCE ARTHUR, PRINCE LOUISE and PRINCE

LEOPOLD who are meant to be accompanying her.  They stand

in a nervous semi-circle, fumbling their harmonies.

Ignoring them completely, VICTORIA bobs up her head with a

quizzical smile to make sure she is being appreciated.

DISRAELI and the rest of the HOUSEHOLD stand a few yards

off, smiling rigidly.  DISRAELI, the consummate politician

to his inch-high insteps, out-smiles the lot of them.  This

man is in raptures of delight.  And the more liquid his

smiles, the happier he makes VICTORIA.  He beams, she

belts, until her children are drowned out completely.

And then, with characteristic suddenness, VICTORIA stops

playing and launches into one of her tirades.  The

HOUSEHOLD wobbles in shock like children on a switch-back,

but DISRAELI glides smoothly from delight to sober concern.

A beat. A nervous silence in the Household.

VICTORIA gives him a tiny smile.  DISRAELI acknowledges it,

then steers the conversation back.

VICTORIA registers a slight flicker of defensiveness at the

implied criticism.

VICTORIA has the measure of him.

The Household waits.  Has he clawed himself back?  VICTORIA

acknowledges his apology.  Her voice drops and she talks

directly to DISRAELI, straight from the heart.

At this moment the far door opens and BROWN walks in.

Without a word, VICTORIA rises from her chair and starts

following him out.  As they pass DISRAELI, she stops.

BROWN measures DISRAELI suspiciously.

VICTORIA smiles.  BROWN stares.

DISRAELI counters effortlessly.

EXT. HIGHLANDS, GLEN GELDER - DAY

Staying close to the ground we develop through a series of

shots showing the other highlands -- sheet rain against

heather and gorse, rivulets of water slashing through mud,

crude pathways sliding in wind and all ball-breakingly

cold.

Coming up the hill, we begin to make out a hunting party.

The sound first.  Like a small army, crashing their way up

the winding path.  GHILLIES urging on their horses and

dogs, guns and equipment jangling off pony-hacks an then

the tall figure of JOHN BROWN striding out in front.

Making no concession to anyone, he force-marches them up

the hill, eyes on the hunt ahead. Behind them trot the men

on horseback -- DISRAELI, PONSONBY, BERTIE and other

GENTLEMEN, each led by GHILLIES and ATTENDANTS, among them

ARCHIE.

Suddenly, BROWN stops and raises a hand.  The party halts.

He listens for a second.  Satisfied that he has found his

quarry, he brings his hand down and the party of gentlemen

dismount as quietly as they can.

As he waits, BROWN winces slightly from the pain in his

side.  He pulls a flask of whiskey from his sporran and

drinks.  All the time, DISRAELI keeps his eyes on BROWN.

EXT. HIGHLANDS, GLEN GELDER - DAY

The stalking.

Everyone is now fanned out along the hillside, a ghillie to

each gentleman, slowly and silently moving up the hill.

DISRAELI stalks with BROWN, panting hard to keep up, eyes

on his man, trying to make no sound.

Suddenly, BROWN stops.  Very slowly he rises.  DISRAELI

rides alongside and sees ...

A huge stag staring majestically across the hillside.

Keeping his movements smooth and slow, BROWN brings up his

rifle, cocks it and offers DISRAELI the kill.  With a

deferential gesture of the hands, DISRAELI declines.  BROWN

stares at him a split-second, raises the rifle to his

shoulder and fires.

EXT. HIGHLANDS, GLEN GELDER - DAY

The kill.

A rapid montage of guns firing, as we cut to ...

INT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY

BROWN sweeps in from the hunt, DISRAELI dripping at his

side.

BROWN pulls out his flask and offers some to DISRAELI, who

declines.  He watches BROWN take a long swig.

INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, UPPER SERVANT'S TABLE - NIGHT

That night.

BROWN is standing at his place, drinking steadily.  He has

a sheet of paper and a pen and is ticking off a list.

Lined up in front of him, trying desperately not to laugh,

are five or six UPPER SERVANTS including the pretty

ASSISTANT DRESSER and BERTIE'S VALET.  They each step up,

one at a time, to make their report.

Folding up the paper, BROWN downs his glass of whiskey and

sits.  On his nod, dinner is served by UNDER SERVANTS amid

a clatter of cutlery and chat.

ARCHIE looks across at his brother but BROWN is hunched

over his plate, pecking at his food.

Someone titters and ARCHIE looks up.  BERTIE'S VALET

coughs.  BROWN slowly lifts his head.  His eyes have the

slightly unfocused look of too much drink.  It is clear to

ARCHIE that he is about to be sent-up.

Brown doesn't react.

Brown drinks.

Everyone bursts out laughing.  Brown slams down his glass.

He stops.  ARCHIE has come across to his brother's chair

and pulls gently on his arm.

BROWN stares at the SERVANTS.  Everyone is about to burst

out laughing.  Keeping his dignity, he pushes back his

chair and lets ARCHIE lead him away.

As BROWN reaches the double doors, the laughter hits him in

the back like a wave. ARCHIE holds him steady.

INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, BROWN'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

BROWN is lying on a grubby bed.  ARCHIE is looking around

the untidy room.  For the first time, he notices a thick

manuscript on the table.  BROWN follows his eyes.

ARCHIE turns back to BROWN.

BROWN shuts his eyes and starts to drift.  ARCHIE watches

over him.

A beat.

INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, SERVANT'S CORRIDOR - DAY

Dawn the next morning.

BROWN is scrambling into his jacket as he hurries down the

stairs.

EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY

BROWN crashes out of a side-door -- just fully dressed --

to be met by the smiling figure of DISRAELI.  He is got up

in smart walking boots, plus-fours and a tweed jacket.

BROWN stares straight back.

EXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY

An hour later, BROWN leads DISRAELI up the hill.  BROWN has

his head down, on with the job.  DISRAELI slows to a halt.

They reach the top and continue along the high ground.

DISRAELI glances at BROWN and notices the limp.

DISRAELI admires the view for a moment, then continues.

He looks across.  BROWN keeps staring ahead.

BROWN stares for a long moment.  Finally he speaks.

DISRAELI steps a little closer.

BROWN watches him, eyes alert.

DISRAELI is right on his shoulder now, like his own voice.

Silence.  For a moment BROWN seems unaware that someone

else has said that.

BROWN stares off into the distance.

EXT. LOCH MUICK - DAY

The next day.

BROWN is rowing VICTORIA across the loch.  The EQUERRIES

wait on the shore.

VICTORIA trails her hand in the water, frowning at the

surface.  BROWN concentrates on the oars, slipping them

carefully through the water.

BROWN does not answer.

She notices that BROWN has said nothing.

BROWN does not look at her.  Finally:

VICTORIA stares at him.

INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, QUEEN'S DRAWING ROOM - DAY

Later that day.

VICTORIA and BROWN are in the middle of a blazing row in

front of the entire Household, including PONSONBY, JENNER

and LADY ELY.

BROWN rounds on her, deeply wounded.

Face turned from him, VICTORIA replies in a brittle voice.

A long silence.  BROWN watches her, but she will not look

at him again.  Finally, she walks very slowly across the

room.  She turns in the doorway, her voice faltering

slightly.

As the door slams, we ...

CAPTION: "NOVEMBER"

INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, DINING ROOM - DAY

A few weeks later.

Close on a door as it opens.  The ROYAL FAMILY are eating

lunch with members of the UPPER HOUSEHOLD.  VICTORIA walks

in with LADY ELY.

A great scraping of chairs as everyone drops their forks

and stands.  Clearly, they were not expecting her.  In

silence, VICTORIA steps up and takes her place at the head

of the table.

At last, PONSONBY leans forward deferentially.

VICTORIA nods, then turns and looks about at the others.

PRINCESS ALEXANDRA is seated at the far end of the table.

VICTORIA frowns.

VICTORIA stares blankly at DOCTOR JENNER.

VICTORIA stops.  She stares down the length of the table.

A long pause.

No answer.

A beat.

Suddenly, VICTORIA stands.  Chairs bang back as everyone

leaps to their feet.

Abruptly, VICTORIA turns for the door and the room erupts

into activity.

INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, CORRIDOR - DAY

BROWN stands in the corridor, a little nonplussed by the

servants and Householders hurrying about in every

direction.

EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY

Half an hour later, BROWN races up to the Queen's carriage

amid a swarm of servants, ladies' maids and Householders

rushing to be ready in time.

Suddenly the huge castle doors open and VICTORIA bustles

out with her entourage in tow.  BROWN -- only just in time

- yanks open the door for VICTORIA to step past him and

take her place.  She ignores him completely.

BROWN slams the doors.  As he looks up, he sees his brother

ARCHIE staring at him from across the courtyard.  For a

second the two brothers hold each other's gaze.  It's

obvious that ARCHIE has noticed the Queen's indifference.

BROWN turns away and mounts the box as the carriage races

away under him.

INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, PRINCE'S BEDCHAMBER - DAY

Some days later.  A tableau.

QUEEN VICTORIA sits at the foot of the bed, a matriarch

surrounded by her ROYAL FAMILY.  They watch DOCTOR JENNER

bend to examine the ghostly figure of BERTIE.  He listens

for a pulse.  Finally, he looks up.

VICTORIA lets out a deep breath.  She takes hold of

PRINCESS ALEXANDRA'S hand.

INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, CORRIDOR OUTSIDE BEDCHAMBER - DAY

A few minutes later, BROWN stands in the corridor when the

door bursts open and VICTORIA marches straight past him

with PONSONBY at her side.

VICTORIA turns and disappears down the corridor, followed

by PONSONBY.  We linger on BROWN'S humiliation, closer and

closer until ...

EXT. WINDSOR CASTLE, ST. GEORGE'S - DAY

Some weeks later.

A series of angles on BROWN as he walks amid the mass of

onlookers pressing against a cordon of guards surrounding

the cathedral.  All the time, his eyes flick left and

right, searching the faces in front of him for potential

assassins.  Over his intense watchfulness we hear ...

The CONGREGATION mutters a vast ...

EXT. WINDSOR CASTLE, ST. GEORGE'S - DAY

VICTORIA and other members of the ROYAL FAMILY walk down

the steps towards the cheering crowd.  As DEAN WELLSELLY

and BROWN follow, BROWN sees ARTHUR O'CONNER break from the

onlookers, pulling out a gun.  BROWN yells out:

He races toward O'CONNER and hits him flying, bangs him to

the ground and twists the gun out of his hand.  As they

fall we hear laughter and:

INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, DINING HALL - NIGHT

It's a few days later and BERTIE is entertaining a private

dinner party.  They include QUEEN VICTORIA, PRINCESS

ALEXANDRA, PRINCESS LOUISE and HENRY PONSONBY.  BROWN is in

attendance.  He stands off to one side, near the door.

More chortling.  VICTORIA watches her son, smiling proudly.

BROWN looks straight ahead.

No-one registers BROWN.  But while VICTORIA does not look

at him, she is acutely aware of his presence.

The guests applaud politely.  BERTIE clinks his glass for

attention and raises it high.

The others raise their glasses in unison.

VICTORIA smiles.  BROWN remains alone by the door.

INT. CRYSTAL PALACE - DAY

DISRAELI is delivering his come-back speech at a banquet of

Tory delegates.

CAPTION: "1883"

INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, BROWN'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

The sound of rain driven hard against a window.  We creep

slowly down the corridor until we are back with the fifty

year-old BROWN.  With his whiskey for company, he is

sitting at his desk, writing in the diary.

The diary-manuscript is now falling apart with wear, but

there remain a few blank pages.  Slowly, he fills them in.

A knock at the door.

We hear a young PAGE, breathless from running.

BROWN grabs his gun and rushes out.

EXT. WINDSOR CASTLE, QUADRANGLE - NIGHT

BROWN appears at the door and strides into the storm.  He

walks quickly across the wide quadrangle, rain soaking his

hair and clothes.

Two GUARDS watch BROWN as he races out into the storm.

A coin flips through the air to be caught by an

outstretched hand.  The second GUARD grins.

EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE - NIGHT

BROWN races across the open ground towards the forest.

EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT

And now we are back with the opening sequence.  Truncated,

severe, and shot from a slightly different angle.  The

driving rain, BROWN hurtling through the trees, the crack

to his left, he spins and plunges on.

EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT

Close-up on BROWN as he bangs against a tree, heaving for

air.  He searches the dark, stops, listens and races on.

EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT

BROWN tears through the trees, pistol raised at full arm's

length.

EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT

He bursts into a clearing, breaks to the centre and stops.

Pistol raised, he turns a circle, eyes on the wildly

swaying trees.  A branch snaps behind him.  He spins round,

bellows deep from his heart:

And fires.

INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, CORRIDOR - NIGHT

A few days later.

VICTORIA is moving swiftly down a long corridor with LADY

ELY.  They arrive at a door.  VICTORIA stands facing it.

LADY ELY doesn't answer.  VICTORIA knows anyway.  She nods.

LADY ELY knocks.  The door is opened by a young UNDER

SERVANT who gawps at the sight of Her Majesty standing here

in the servant's quarters.  VICTORIA walks in.

INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, BROWN'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

The room has been cleared of bottles, but the thinness of

the life here shocks her deeply.  The cheap furniture, the

anonymous prints, the bed and, finally, the sight of BROWN.

He is lying in bed, barely conscious.  After a moment, he

opens his eyes and stares at her.  She steps forward,

smiling nervously.

Her voice is the old voice, between friends.

He cannot speak.  It's difficult for her too, but she

speaks for him.

Her voice falters.  A pause

She starts to cry.

His old, familiar gruffness makes her smile and she pulls

herself together.  Seeing a bowl of water on the side

table, she steps across.  Carefully folding a cloth in

four, she rinses it in the water and gently wipes his face.

Leaning closer, she is about to touch his face when BROWN

gestures protectively.

INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, CORRIDOR - DAY

A week later.  PONSONBY and JENNER stand at the window

overlooking the grounds.

A beat.

He brings out BROWN'S tatty diary-manuscript and hands it

over to PONSONBY.  The two men move away from the window,

to go their separate ways.  Daily business beckons.

JENNER nods.

The two men head off in opposite directions down the

corridor.
