NIKI and JAMES's cars lined up in positions 1 and 2 on the

starting grid. JAMES proudly indicates to NIKI...

NIKI calls after JAMES as he walks to his car...

JAMES turns, makes a ratty face at NIKI. Protruding teeth.

RICHARD BURTON and LIZ TAYLOR are shown into the VIP area of

the paddock. They take their seats.

An OFFICIAL introduces BURTON to various people - among them

SUZY HUNT...

There it is. The deep, dark, sonorous Welsh baritone

voice...scarred by alcohol and cigarettes...

He indicates LIZ who is deeply bored..

SUZY smiles. Their eyes meet. And no eyes are more beautiful

than SUZY's. An immediate connection between them.

Their hands hold a fraction too long as they shake...

NIKI's car roars past the finishing line first. JAMES closely

behind...

CAPTION: "SOUTH AFRICA. LAUDA WINS. HUNT SECOND."

JAMES and NIKI are on the podium together...

JAMES's car takes the chequered flag, finishing first!!!

In the pits: TEDDY MAYER, ALASTAIR CALDWELL and JOHN HOGAN

leap to their feet in delight. Punching the air. Victory..

CAPTION: "RACE 3. SPAIN. HUNT WINS..."

Afterwards: JAMES and NIKI are on the podium together...

JAMES walks off, to celebrate with the McLaren team...

NIKI stares darkly - threatened - watching JAMES go..

...then goes to talk to LUCA DE MONTEZEMOLO and the FERRARI

team.

CAPTION: "...BUT IS THEN DISQUALIFIED".

A huge furore as several OFFICIALS and FERRARI TEAM MEMBERS,

and TV CREWS surround JAMES's car...

Raised voices debating the width of the car, HUNT furious,

people almost coming to blows...

The two rival PIT CREWS, (McLaren and Ferrari), scream abuse

at one another in Italian and English - a highly charged and

explosive atmosphere....

CAPTION: "LAUDA GETS MAXIMUM POINTS"

NIKI watches from the inside of the FERRARI TRAILER.

The McLaren MECHANICS, supervised by Alastair Caldwell, are

making adjustments to the car to make it `legal'..

JAMES watches - already fearing the worst - as the car is

stripped down, effectively being rebuilt...

"BANG", JAMES's car shudders violently, the wheels shake as

the drive shaft snaps...

CAPTION: "RACE 4. LAUDA WINS. HUNT RETIRES."

"BOOM", a loud explosion. A thick plume of black smoke billows

from the engine...

CAPTION: "RACE 5. LAUDA WINS AGAIN. HUNT RETIRES."

"CRASH" - JAMES spins out...and a tyre bounces along the

track...JAMES's car has crashed into a wall...

The tyre continues bouncing, people diving out of it's path,

before the tyre finally smashes into a hot-dog stand...

CAPTION: "RACE 6. LAUDA WINS AGAIN. HUNT RETIRES."

JAMES storms back into the pits, screaming at MAYER, CALDWELL

and the MECHANICS...

CAPTION: "LAUDA 56 POINTS, HUNT 6"

Later: the victorious NIKI, wearing the garland, is all

smiles, giving `winner' interviews, surrounded by MARLENE and

a delighted LUCA DI MONTEZEMOLO.

JAMES is also giving interviews, but in a total fury.

Vibrating with anger. Still complaining about the

disqualification. Complaining about a conspiracy. Complaining.

NIKI finishes talking to JOURNALISTS, and walks off, through

crowds, and bumps into JAMES..

NIKI turns to MARLENE, speaks in German...

NIKI and MARLENE go. JAMES is left staring. Not understanding.

JAMES walks into the crowded MCLAREN pits. Sees TEDDY MAYER

and ALASTAIR CALDWELL...

CALDWELL nervously indicates the Sunday newspapers...

JAMES looks at the newspapers, then his expression changes.

Lurid headlines about SUZY HUNT in New York with RICHARD

BURTON. Pictures all over the front pages of RICHARD BURTON,

ELIZABETH TAYLOR, SUZY and JAMES. JAMES's face falls..

A jumbo jet roars down the runway and takes off...

The unmistakable skyline. Among the ten thousand craggy

rooftops and skyscrapers...

A grand, five-star hotel overlooking Central Park in

Manhattan's mid-town district...

A huge collection of paparazzi SNAPPERS and Journalist HACKS

is camped outside the hotel.

Immediately a surge of activity, "Here he is"...

A burst of flashlights and a volley of questions from the

JOURNALISTS as JAMES - gets out of the taxi and runs the

gauntlet of humiliation...

...into the hotel..

A large hotel suite. There are flowers everywhere. Newspapers

are all over the table.

JAMES sits opposite SUZY. He sees an expensive gift; recently

opened. A diamond necklace..

SUZY nods. Even the uninitiated eye can tell: it's worth a

fortune.

A flicker behind JAMES's eyes. Failure.

JAMES manages a brave smile.

JAMES notices the vast unmade bed. Where, until recently, two

people had slept.

JAMES emerges from the hotel - into the storm of paparazzi

again. He manages a brave smile...

Laughter from the JOURNALISTS who are hungrily writing down

the copy. But JAMES's hollow smile fools no one...

JAMES sits alone in the first class section. A loser on the

track, and a loser in love, too. Being played out in the full

glare of publicity. On the front pages. Being read by everyone

on the plane.

A STEWARDESS looks over, catches his eye. Smiles.

JAMES and the STEWARDESS fucking. Hard.

Nothing to do with pleasure. An analgesic - a way of blocking

out the pain. JAMES catches his own reflection in the mirror.

Teeth clenched. Eyes burning with anger and self-loathing...

OVER THIS: we fade in the ROAR of car engines...

JAMES's teeth still clenched. Eyes still burning with anger.

Driving flat out. At the limit.

Suzy's words still ringing in his ears.

Make that beyond the limit. At the point of no return. The car

shaking. Weaving recklessly through other cars...

Where death has become a real option.

Because he doesn't care anymore. Because it's all he deserves

anyway...

And in that moment, in reaching his lowest point, JAMES has

unwittingly stumbled on the one thing that gives him an

advantage over everyone else...

The fact that he doesn't care. The fact that death has become

an option. The fact that there is no risk he is not prepared

to take...

So every corner is tighter, every braking point later, every

gap is an opening, no matter how tiny...

The chequered flag waves as JAMES's car roars across the

finish line...

JAMES screams with released rage....

CAPTION: "RACE 7. HUNT WINS. LAUDA's ENGINE BLOWS UP"

Afterwards: TEDDY MAYER, ALASTAIR CALDWELL and JOHN HOGAN

celebrate in delight...cheering...

NIKI's car is pursued by JAMES's. They disappear behind a

copse of trees. Out of sight.

When they re-emerge, JAMES is ahead of NIKI, having overtaken

him - to the delight of the partisan crowd.

The chequered flag waves again as JAMES's car roars across the

finish line...

CAPTION: "RACE 8. HUNT WINS. LAUDA 2nd."

JAMES screams in catharsis and triumph. Teeth clenched. Eyes

wide and staring with concentration.

We notice SCREAMING GIRL FANS cheering him now.

A blazer-wearing FIA OFFICIAL addresses a room full of sports

and motoring JOURNALISTS, TV CREWS, etc...

JAMES, TEDDY MAYER, ALASTAIR CALDWELL, and all the MECHANICS

are watching on TV...

Huge celebrations. Cheering and whooping. SCREAMING GIRLS.

A crowded PRESS room. In opposite corners of the room, JAMES

and NIKI are giving interviews to different PRESS and TV

journalists. Stirling Moss is talking to JAMES...

Screaming GIRLS in the background, shouting "James, we love

you." JAMES stares across the room at NIKI...

In the other corner: NIKI is doing his interviews in German,

(we see sub-titles)...

Laughter among the confident GERMANS.

NIKI takes MARLENE's hand, and leads her away.

To establish: the Viennese skyline.

NIKI and MARLENE get married. In stark contrast to JAMES's

wedding...it's a small, intimate affair. Modest. Not showy.

Away from the cameras. Just them. And a witness from the pub.

A small aeroplane takes off...

NIKI and an INSTRUCTOR are in the plane. In the cockpit. With

MARLENE, who watches...

NIKI is learning to fly.

MARLENE watches as NIKI soaks up the instruction, asking

questions, happy. It's another side to him, completely.

NIKI and MARLENE in a pool. In Ibiza. Playing. Laughing.

Honeymooning.

Then NIKI's expression changes. His smile fades.

MARLENE is fast asleep. She wakes, to discover the bed is

empty beside her..

MARLENE walks through the house, looking for NIKI. Then finds

him on a balcony...alone..

MARLENE notices his mood. It's different.

NIKI looks up at MARLENE...

MARLENE stares at him.

MARLENE turns, and goes..

NIKI is left alone. We can tell from his expression, he is

struggling with something for the first time. Fear.

The notoriously difficult and treacherous German race track.

Testing is underway. A CAR (from one of the other teams)

skids, and crashes violently.

AMBULANCES arrive. The Driver is badly hurt. Screaming in

pain. His leg is crushed. Bone is sticking out. A brutal

compound fracture. He is taken away.

In the pits, everyone is shaken. JAMES, REGAZZONI, and other

DRIVERS nervously talk among themselves as the Ambulance races

past.

NIKI's face: visibly pale. More frightened than ever.

Race-day. Huge crowds arrive at the Nurburgring. And rain.

Heavy rain falling.

Television commentary informs us about the Nurburgring's

terrible reputation as a `graveyard' track.

JAMES arrives at the race track, to find ALASTAIR CALDWELL

waiting for him, a concerned look on his face...

JAMES's face. Instantly suspicious.

About sixty people, (26 DRIVERS and all the different team

REPRESENTATIVES), are assembled in the room, where a blazered

FIA OFFICIAL and a member of the DRIVERS SAFETY COMMITTEE are

sitting behind a table...

A buzz of anticipation and curiosity. What's going on? What is

all this about? NIKI gets to his feet, raises his hands

calling for silence...

A ripple of astonished reactions among the drivers..

TEDDY MAYER looks over at FERRARI representatives....

Another DRIVER (GUY EDWARDS) gets to his feet...

Another voice pierces the controversy...

It's JAMES HUNT, who is standing up...

Uproar in the room...

Laughter among the DRIVERS...

Silence. No hand goes up. No one has the courage to own up.

A stunned silence. One voice pierces the room...

It's JAMES who stares at NIKI: a ripple of excitement and

enthusiasm among the other drivers...

NIKI puts his hand up. One or two other racers, too...

JAMES puts his hand up. Clearly the more popular, charismatic

figure among the DRIVERS, everyone else follows.

A clear victory for JAMES. He has swung the room.

Everyone leaves the room. JAMES and TEDDY MAYER give one

another a discreet hi-five...

But we rack focus through the crowd to see NIKI staring at

JAMES accusingly...holding his gaze.

"RRRROAAAR", an explosion of noise, as we widen and find

ourselves on the starting grid of the German Grand Prix.

An OFFICIAL walks through the cars holding aloft a sign, "One

Minute"...

Deafening, angry thunder, as cars rev their engines.

A pupil dilates and contracts in the light. The eye stares.

Blinks. Thinks. Making evaluations..

This time the eye belongs to JAMES. He stares up at the

clouds.

His eyelids flicker. Thinking. Agonizing. Wrestling with an

all important decision...

Is it going to carry on raining? Or become dry?

ALASTAIR CALDWELL comes up to JAMES, and shouts above the

noise - no time to plug his headset in...

JAMES looks in his wing-mirror back to his colleague, JOCHEN

MASS's car, number 12, several rows behind him.

White helmet. A team of Mclaren MECHANICS hastily changing the

tyres to bald, dry tyres - ('slicks'). Then JAMES looks over

at the car beside him...

NIKI's car: surrounded by Italian Ferrari MECHANICS.

JAMES pulls down his visor...as he and NIKI's eyes meet for a

split-second, then...

The STARTER waves the flag. They're off!

JAMES's foot hits the floor - his engine screams at almost

9,000 rpms, drowning out the roar of the 180,000 crowd. The

car is catapaulted forward, the wheel-spin leaving livid black

scars on the asphalt..

JAMES and NIKI both make good starts, and are neck and neck,

but within seconds there's a McLaren right behind them,

gaining fast.

JAMES realizes it's his team-mate, JOCHEN MASS in a white

helmet. Number 12. On his slick tyres.

MASS was right to gamble on the track drying out. JAMES curses

under his breath...

JAMES screwed up. Made the wrong decision. He urgently needs

to change tyres. With barely one lap completed...

He swerves angrily into the pits..

Commentary from all the world's TV stations explaining the

crazy, panicked situation as JAMES comes into the pits to

change to dry tyres.

The McLaren team frantically changes the tyres. Four men with

air guns, two men with rapid-duty jacks.

ALASTAIR CALDWELL appears, talks to JAMES..

JAMES looks in his mirror to see NIKI's red helmet behind him

in the pits, then...

"Thump", new (slick) tyres hit the tarmac. JAMES gets the

signal, `Clear!'

JAMES's foot hits the floor. He roars out, with new tyres,

leaving NIKI behind him in the pits...

Archive commentary: from the world's TV stations informs us

that JAMES roars up into 3rd position..

JAMES gives it everything he's got. Tearing through the gears,

breaking as late as he can, engine screaming.

The world flies past in a blur. The steering wheel shakes. The

car cannot be driven any harder. No thought for safety. No

thought of failure..

Failure is unimaginable. Unconscionable.

He turns into the final straight, then stops when he sees

something ahead.

Flags. Red flags. RACE MARSHALLS. Something has clearly

happened. An accident..

The race is being stopped. JAMES brakes, slowing down. He

pulls level with a uniformed MARSHALL..

NIKI's POV: a continuation of the opening scene. Burning smoke

fills NIKI's helmet, burning his lungs. He cries out in agony.

We can just make out the barely recognizable figures of the

other DRIVERS rushing towards him, as their hands get burnt in

the flames as they try unsuccessfully to undo his seatbelt...

We notice it is the same DRIVERS that were critical of NIKI in

the driver's meeting. HARALD ERTL, BRETT LUNGER, ARTURO

MERZARIO, GUY EDWARDS...

Fire extinguishers blast at the car. Covering NIKI's helmet.

Filling his lungs with chemicals, along with the smoke and

fumes, blurring his vision, as he screams horribly..

The sound of panicked TV COMMENTARY in different languages.

Screaming voices. Panicked reactions.

Then sound fades. As NIKI blacks out - losing consciousness.

OVER THIS: the hypnotic sound of helicopter blades...

NIKI's POV: the door to a helicopter opens, as it arrives at

Mannheim University Hospital...

The sound of shouting voices. Hospital STAFF pull reach

towards NIKI, pull his stretcher out.

NIKI's internal voice groans: cries out at the pain.

"Crash", doors burst open and NIKI is rushed into emergency.

Neon ceiling lights pass overhead...

The sound of difficult breathing.

His stretcher is surrounded by DOCTORS, talking urgently,

making quick assessments..

NIKI's POV: fading in and out of consciousness.

Bursts of concerned, urgent, overlapping dialogue among the

German DOCTORS which NIKI can barely make out..

Two narrow, barely open slits of light. NIKI's swollen eye-

lids. NIKI's POV: barely making out MARLENE standing beside

the senior burns specialist DOCTOR. NIKI hears voices...

NIKI slips out of consciousness again. MARLENE is distraught,

in tears.

TV news: giving the latest information on NIKI's condition.

JAMES sits watching the news on TV in his apartment, while

feeding his budgerigars, (the collection has grown)..

He feels terrible. He goes to his desk, pulls out paper and

pen...

JAMES tries to find the right words, tries to write, tries to

put his feelings on paper, but words in general, and letters

in particular have never been his thing...

JAMES scrunches up the pieces of paper, throws it away. The

budgerigars, sensing his distress, flutter and peep..

NIKI's P.O.V: feels someone touching his forehead and his

hands with oil...and the sound of a WOMAN weeping...

NIKI's eyes barely crack open, barely manage to focus to see

an ELDERLY PRIEST is giving him the last rites in German..

The sound of MARLENE crying somewhere in the room.

NIKI strains to move. A sense of excruciating pain.

He fights to open his eyes, give an indication...ANY

indication of the fact that he is hearing this, and is alive

and able to fight for life...

But to no avail. The PRIEST continues giving last rites.

MARLENE continues to cry. The PRIEST touches NIKI's

shoulder...

NIKI screams inside. Wanting to be heard. Wanting to give them

a sign. He's OK. He's still there. But it's no use.

NIKI blacks out again. The pain is too great.

Sunrise: MARLENE has been sitting in the hospital all night

supported by members of FAMILY and several FRIENDS.

Niki's MOTHER and FATHER. CLAY REGAZZONI.

Presently: the door to the intensive care unit opens and a

DOCTOR comes out, beckoning her...

MARLENE scrambles to her feet...

MARLENE covers her mouth, laughs nervously, already in tears.

She and the DOCTOR rush into the intensive care unit.

Shooting through the window we see MARLENE approach NIKI's

bed. She sees NIKI..

And gasps. Trying to control her expression. Not give away to

him how horrified she is.

NIKI's face: is grotesque. His head has swollen to double it's

size. The skin has burned off on his head, his eyes.

MARLENE bravely composes herself. Then, without displaying the

shock she feels - she goes over and kisses him.

The starter's flag drops. On television we see the Austrian

Grand Prix start.

NIKI watches the race on television, while beginning his rehab

in bed, in pain as bandages are changed..

ON TV: JAMES narrowly misses out on a podium, but still gains

on NIKI in his points total...

CAPTION: "RACE 11. HUNT FINISHES 4th"

NIKI continues his rehab in the hospital, now out of bed...

ON TV: the starter's flag drops. Another Grand Prix starts.

This time at Zandvoort, in the Netherlands..

NIKI watches the race on television as DOCTORS put a vacuuum

pump into his lungs. It's AGONY. JAMES leads, driving the

perfect race...

An unimaginably painful pump is forced down his burned lungs,

to try to hoover out the impurities..

COMMENTATORS ON TV: talk about how HUNT is catching up with

LAUDA on points. It spurs NIKI on, through gritted teeth.

The chequered flag. JAMES crosses the line in first position.

CAPTION: "RACE 12. HUNT WINS."

The DOCTORS tell NIKI he's had enough vacuum treatment. He's

had more than enough pain. But NIKI waves them aside...

The DOCTOR nods. The vacuum is turned on again.

NIKI screams in agony. Eyes bulging. MARLENE and NIKI's family

cannot bear to watch...

He watches as ON TV: JAMES is on the victory podium spraying

champagne.

NIKI continues screaming in pain, watching the Canadian GP on

TV as..

CAPTION: "RACE 13 CANADIAN GRAND PRIX. HUNT WINS AGAIN"

For the first time, JAMES has taken the lead in points. NIKI

stares at the TV: his expression changes.

NIKI screams again. MARLENE, NIKI's family and the DOCTORS are

deeply distressed, cannot bring themselves to watch, as...

We WIDEN to reveal what NIKI is doing. What has caused these

unbearable, bloodcurdling screams of agony..

Now we see. With great difficulty NIKI has put his racing

helmet on for the first time. Pressing into his open burn

wounds...

He is almost unconscious with pain. His legs are weak. But he

has done it...

The Italian Grand Prix. TELEVISION COMMENTARY sets the scene.

JAMES and the MCLAREN TEAM arrive in the pits to see a vast

commotion going on elsewhere...

JAMES stares. Shaken.

JAMES pushes through the pitlanes, until he reaches the

crowded FERRARI pits. He sees a racer in the background. The

name LAUDA on his overalls...

NIKI turns round. JAMES sets eyes on him for the first time.

JAMES reels, visibly horrified by his appearance. His bandages

are blood stained. He has no hair. Looks grotesque..

NIKI sees the horror in JAMES's face. Sees the shock. The

horror. And recognizes in that moment, this is how it's going

to be - this is how people will respond to him - forever.

JAMES opens his mouth. Tries to say something.

NIKI stares at JAMES, at his rival's beauty, his blonde,

tanned perfection. His matinee idol, movie star looks...

Ouch. That could have been meant generously. But in this case

it wasn't. It was a cold slap in the face.

NIKI turns and goes.

A packed press conference. The world's media. NIKI's accident

and recovery (as a story) has reached way beyond F1 race fans.

This is front page news around the globe..

NIKI walks out onto the podium - all eyes staring at him - the

sense of a ghoulish, voyeuristic freak show....

NIKI sits on the podium, in front of microphones, flanked on

both sides by FERRARI drivers and top brass. But no one wants

to talk to them. Everyone's here to talk to NIKI..

Laughter. At the back of the hall, JAMES HUNT creeps in,

(unseen by anyone, disguised in a hat), to listen.

Laughter.

Laughter.

Laughter.

Laughter.

Silence. NIKI squints into the lights..

No one moves. NIKI, disgusted, rips off his microphone..

NIKI walks out. The Press Conference breaks up...

JAMES sees the REPORTER who asked the question, laughing with

his friends. JAMES watches as the REPORTER leaves...

JAMES goes after the REPORTER, and calls him..

The REPORTER turns, recognizes JAMES..

The BRITISH JOURNALIST smiles, "Great, thanks James!" Pulls

out a tape recorder. JAMES takes him to one side, then...

"WHACK, WHACK, WHACK" - JAMES punches his lights out, then

takes the tape recorder, stuffs it into the JOURNALISTS mouth.

"CRASH" a final, sickening blow splits the REPORTER's nose..

JAMES walks out to his car. TV CREWS. Banks of PHOTOGRAPHERS.

Commentators talk in different languages.

Everyone talking about NIKI's comeback.

NIKI is in his car. The MECHANICS are talking to him in

Italian...

But NIKI hears nothing. He looks at the steering wheel, the

shell of the car, the gear stick. And then we see..

His hands are shaking violently. He's utterly terrified.

The light turns green. They're off!

Other cars (including JAMES's), roar forward. But NIKI is

frozen.

NIKI's mind is a mess - terrified - he starts slowly...finding

his courage..

COMMENTATORS point out it's madness. It was clearly too soon.

Ferrari were right to hire a replacement. NIKI is a wreck..

NIKI suffers terrible flashbacks from his accident...

NIKI shakes himself out...gradually building up speed -

ignoring the cars overtaking him all around him...

NIKI begins to accelerate. Gently at first. Then a bit more.

Trusting himself. Gaining confidence..

Blocking out further flashbacks...

Watching NIKI from the hospital where he had his treatment is

the DOCTOR who treated him...

COMMENTATORS look up. Notice NIKI's slow increase in speed.

What's this? Maybe there's life in him yet...

NIKI changes gears smoothly. He begins to overtake. The old

feelings come back..

MARLENE watches from the pits. Can hardly bring herself to

look...

COMMENTATORS begin to get excited. LAUDA has started to

overtake the back-markers...

An incredible sequence. As NIKI gains more confidence, more

speed, and begins to work his way through the field..

COMMENTATORS now buzzing with excitement. This is incredible,

as NIKI overtakes first CARLOS REUTEMANN, the driver hired to

replace him, then others, working his way through the field...

JAMES sees NIKI coming up behind him. Cannot believe his eyes.

JAMES move to block NIKI's path...

NIKI attacks fearlessly. Despite terrible pain. NIKI moves to

overtake JAMES.

Utterly intimidated by NIKI's bravery, JAMES panics, and loses

control of the car. He spins out..

COMMENTATORS cannot believe their eyes. HUNT's blown it!

LAUDA's overtaken him!

It's a miracle. It defies belief. As NIKI crosses the line....

CAPTION: "RACE 15. NIKI 4th. JAMES RETIRED."

The Italian crowds are ecstatic. Delirious. NIKI is a national

hero. Lazarus back from the dead. Superhuman.

TV commentary in different languages elaborates on what an

extraordinary, superhuman achievement they have just seen...

CAPTION: "LAUDA 68 POINTS. HUNT 65 POINTS."

Hunt walks past, staring at a triumphant Niki.

The DOCTOR in the hospital shakes his head, cannot believe

what he has just witnessed...

The Ferrari Mechanics that had initially so disliked NIKI, are

overwhelmed by what he has achieved...

A reluctant, modest NIKI carried on shoulders, surrounded by

LUCA DI MONTEZEMOLO, MARLENE and the PRESS...

Mount Fuji towers imperiously, dramatically above the Japanese

race track, dominating the skyline on a clear day..

Television cameras and press photographers assemble at the

race track for the biggest sporting event of the year...

JAMES sits alone in his hotel suite. Speaking to an old,

trusted friend at the other end...

BUBBLES HORSLEY back at home in England. At a breakfast

table..

A knock at JAMES's hotel room door..

JAMES hangs up, and goes to the door. He snaps it open to

reveal..

Two gorgeous-looking BOAC Stewardesses standing outside. Smart

blue blazers, short skirts, white gloves, blue caps..

Sure enough: on JAMES's door, the number 2109.

JAMES can't believe it. NIKI.

JAMES closes the door. Goes back into his hotel room. Then,

after a moment...

He snaps open the door. The STEWARDESSES are about to

disappear into the elevator...

The following morning, day barely breaks. The skies are

ominously dark over Tokyo. Thick, black clouds.

It's raining heavily...

NIKI wakes up and looks out of the window. Sees the heavy rain

which is falling outside...

His expression changes.

JAMES wakes up. Flinches. JAMES looks around, bleary-eyed.

Hungover.

He's in a room that looks like a bomb has hit it.

The two STEWARDESSES are still asleep in the bed beside him.

Uniforms discarded on the floor.

Memories are now flooding back. Jesus, what was he THINKING?

JAMES leaps out of bed.

NIKI is being massaged by WILLI DUNGL in his hotel room in

preparation for the race.

NIKI continues to stare out of the window. They speak in

German. We see sub-titles..

NIKI's POV: the view. Nothing but mist, dark skies and rain.

Inside the race track: puddles everywhere. The rain continues

to fall. The circuit is covered in water...

DRIVERS and the TEAMS arrive at the race track. JAMES and

TEDDY MAYER and ALASTAIR CALDWELL among them...

SPECTATORS are huddled under umbrellas. TV CREWS struggle to

keep expensive equipment dry...

An American VOICE comes over the tannoy...

JAMES looks at CALDWELL...

A driver's meeting has been called. All the DRIVERS are in a

small room, arguing and remonstrating with FIA OFFICIALS and

blazer-wearing POWERS THAT BE...

A Japanese official, (AKIYAMA), is trying to keep the peace...

Local JAPANESE DRIVERS are complaining in Japanese, (we see

sub-titles)...

JAMES, MAYER and CALDWELL arrive in a corridor outside the

meeting room...

JAMES's POV: he can see NIKI, his wounds horribly visible,

remonstrating with the JAPANESE OFFICIAL about the dangerous

track conditions...

JAMES turns to TEDDY and ALASTAIR...

JAMES raises his hands and walks off. CALDWELL shouts after

him, "James, wait..!" Then MAYER reassures CALDWELL...

MAYER can see that a vote is taking place in the room. Many of

the drivers have their hands in the air, voting...

The JAPANESE OFFICIAL is struggling to keep order in the room.

A round of applause in the room, as the DRIVERS vote to cancel

the race. But unseen by the DRIVERS..

The FIA OFFICIALS, TV NETWORK EXECUTIVES, and the blazered

POWERS THAT BE are in dark, conspiratorial discussion..

...making the decision that the race goes ahead.

NEWSCASTERS from all over the world, in several different

languages, announce that a decision has been made..

The JAPANESE Grand Prix is definitely going ahead. The drivers

have been called to the starting grid...

In the pits alongside JAMES...

A series of shots of the other DRIVERS...being sent out like

lambs to the slaughter...

Visibly terrified, mouthing prayers, smoking last cigarettes,

meditating, crossing themselves, hands shaking..

Among them the JAPANESE DRIVERS. All laughter gone now.

Realizing what they've got into. Risking their lives.

Finally we come to rest on NIKI. Strangely calm.

NIKI puts on his balaclava over his still-raw wounds, wincing

with pain as he puts on his helmet..

JAMES is piggy-backed to his car by MECHANICS so his feet

don't get soaked in the water pooling deep on the track.

JAMES lowers himself into a car with puddles on the seat. He

straps himself in.

ALISTAIR CALDWELL approaches with a power-drill. Leans towards

JAMES, with the screaming drill...

`ZZZZ", "ZZZZ", "ZZZZ", CALDWELL drill holes in JAMES's visor.

CALDWELL stares at JAMES...

CALDWELL gestures, "Nothing"..

They shake hands. JAMES starts the engine with a roar.

NIKI's engine replies with a loud roar. He looks over at

JAMES. JAMES turns to face NIKI..

ALL SOUND GOES SILENT...

...as JAMES and NIKI stare at one another. All around them,

the world slows down. Comes to a standstill.

THEIR EYES MEET...

A connection between them. Unspoken realization of where they

have both got to. What this moment means. For them both..

It's what they have been waiting for. Working towards. All

this time.

NIKI raises his hand. In a gesture only JAMES sees. JAMES

raises his in return. A private salute.

Chivalric. From a bygone era. And in that moment, enemies

become brothers. Two men. Risking their lives.

THE TEN SECOND FLAG IS RAISED..

The moment's truce is broken. They return to the task at hand.

THE FLAG DROPS. THEY'RE OFF.

HUNT's foot hits the floor. NIKI's foot hits the floor...

JAMES gets the better start. His car aquaplanes like crazy,

skating over the water, totally out of control...

CALDWELL and MAYER watch from the pit wall...

Miraculously JAMES steadies the car...

The spray from his wheels creates a curtain of mist. The other

cars are wrapped inside it...

But JAMES has a clear view ahead. He slams his foot down..

NIKI can see nothing. Surrounded by spray, water, noise.

Other cars are spinning all around him. It's chaos. NIKI

bravely accelerates into blindness...

JAMES goes to a corner, then his car twitches, aquaplanes

again...badly...almost losing it completely...

BUBBLES HORSLEY, ALEXANDER HESKETH and a number of the

characters from the Hesketh Racing days are all watching...

JAMES struggles to hold onto his car. He steadies it,

maintaining the lead.

JAMES's spray makes it impossible for NIKI to see. NIKI can't

blink his eyes...it's agony.

Half-blind, NIKI tries to overtake. Gives it everything he's

got, breaking as late as he can, tearing through the gears...

For NIKI the world flies past in a near-blind blur. The

steering wheel shakes. The car cannot be driven any harder.

But the visibility is terrible. The spray tears into his

scarred eyes. He is unable to see anything but...

MARLENE's beautiful face: staring at him. Smiling tenderly.

Kissing him tenderly.

JAMES continues to race flat out. Engine screaming. Foot to

the floor. His car aquaplanes again...almost skidding out...

SUZY HUNT is watching on television as RICHARD BURTON talks in

the background on the telephone...

A sign is held up as JAMES races. Lap 39.

But there are problems with the car. One of the tyres...

CALDWELL and TEDDY MAYER watch in horror from the pits and on

TV. They can see the shaking car..

ALASTAIR CALDWELL holds up a sign....

JAMES's car roars past the pits, refusing to stop...

HESKETH and BUBBLES cover their eyes. Can't look...

Suddenly, a Ferrari in JAMES's wing mirror. Unmistakably, even

in the spray, he can see the distinctive RED HELMET...

It's NIKI. JAMES's blood runs cold...

JAMES tries to fend NIKI off. Swerves this way and that. But

his wounded car is now running at seventy per cent at best...

...and disaster!!! NIKI OVERTAKES HIM...

JAMES screams in agony and frustration. He's lost it! And has

no one to blame but himself! His own arrogance. And

stubbornness. NIKI's overtaken him!

THE CHEQUERED FLAG.

JAMES roars past. Has finished in third place. But that is no

consolation. NIKI has beaten him. As far as he's concerned..

JAMES has lost. Lost everything.

JAMES's car arrives in the pits. In a fury. At himself. For

refusing to listen. What a disgrace. What shame. What a fool.

But he is engulfed. JAMES gets out of his car, raging...

But TEDDY MAYER is celebrating wildly. ALASTAIR CALDWELL, too.

The world's media descends on JAMES...

TEDDY MAYER takes JAMES's number `11' from the side of his

car, and tears it in two, leaving number `1'.

JAMES's face: as he realizes. Then explodes with happiness.

HESKETH and BUBBLES cheer in celebration...

A television plays in the Emergency Ward of the hospital.

NURSIE catches sight of the victory, patients cheering and

applauding...

NURSIE allows herself a smile.

BURTON is at the door in tuxedo, waiting to go. SUZY, dressed

glamorously, smiles.

Then turns the TV off. And follows BURTON out.

JAMES is embraced by CALDWELL and MAYER.

Across the race-track, the sound of helicopter blades turning.

JAMES looks over to see...

NIKI in the helicopter with MARLENE and a PILOT. NIKI, now the

ex-World Champion, looks over to see a triumphant JAMES

surrounded by press, McLaren colleagues, etc

NIKI turns, takes MARLENE's hand as he answers.

The helicopter lifts into the air, and flies off...

JAMES watches as the helicopter carrying NIKI flies away, then

turns to see...

...the world's press begins to descend on him, and the biggest

party of JAMES HUNT's life is about to begin..

In the background, the two JAPANESE DRIVERS are giving

interviews again. They didn't just survive, MASAHIRO HASEMI

got the fastest lap of the race, and NORITAKE TAKAHARA came

9th...

And at that moment, magically, the sun breaks through, and the

snowy peak of Mount Fuji is finally revealed.

Of newspaper headlines, television talk shows, lucrative

endorsements, TV commercials, sponsorship, public billboards.

JAMES's world championship victory has made him a rich man.

His movie star looks make him an international STAR and

marketing man's dream.

Girls, more girls, and even more girls.

JAMES, dashing in a white suit, plays trumpet on the UK's most

famous talk show...

We're on the runway of an airport in Northern Italy.

CAPTION: "THREE MONTHS LATER"

A stretch limousine pulls up on the tarmac.

A still-drunk JAMES HUNT and several good-looking WOMEN, rowdy

FRIENDS (and hangers-on) spill out of the limo...

They cross the tarmac towards their waiting private jet,

passing other jets, when JAMES stops.

He's seen something that has caught his eye.

JAMES sends his FRIENDS on ahead to their waiting jet, and

walks over to a small private jet, (a Learjet 35)...

A hunched PILOT doing final checks. The figure turns. It's

NIKI. His wounds have healed a little, but it's still a

painful sight...

JAMES indicates his rowdy, cool-looking friends..

JAMES can't help smiling. That's NIKI.

The plane load of JAMES's friends call out..."C'mon, James!"

NIKI stares. A blank look..

JAMES goes. NIKI watches him, pulled into his plane by his

laughing, cool FRIENDS. An unmistakable flicker of envy in his

eyes.

Then NIKI turns, alone, and resumes his safety checks.

JAMES's plane roars down the runway and takes off into the

azure blue sky...

CAPTION: "JAMES RETURNED THE FOLLOWING SEASON, BUT WAS NEVER A

CHALLENGER AGAIN. HE RETIRED IN 1979. AFTER SHORT CAREERS IN

BROADCASTING AND BUDGIE BREEDING HE DIED OF A HEART ATTACK.

AGED 45."

CAPTION: "NIKI LAUDA WENT ON TO BECOME WORLD CHAMPION IN 1977.

AND AGAIN IN 1984. HE NOW RUNS A SUCCESSFUL COMMERCIAL

AIRLINE. HE STILL CLAIMS TO HAVE NO FRIENDS."
