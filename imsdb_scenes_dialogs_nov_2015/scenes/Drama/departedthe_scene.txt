SCRIPT AS SHOT COMPILED SEPTEMBER 2006

FADE UP ON

THE SOUTH BOSTON HOUSING PROJECTS. A MAZE OF BUILDINGS

AGAINST THE HARBOR.

YELLOW RIPPLES PAST THE CAMERA AND WHEN IT CLEARS WE SEE

THROUGH DIESEL SMOKE: A BUSING PROTEST IN PROGRESS. THE

SCHOOL-BUS, FULL OF BLACK KIDS, IS HIT WITH BRICKS, ROCKS.

N.B.: (THIS IS NOT SETTING THE LIVE ACTION IN 1974; IT IS A

HISTORICAL MONTAGE, THE BACKGROUND FOR COSTELLO'S V.O.).

INT. THE AUTOBODY SHOP. DAY.

COSTELLO's profile passes in a dark room.

EXT. SOUTHIE. VARIOUS

The neighborhood. 1980's. We won't be here long. This isn't

where Costello ends up. It's where he began. Liquor stores

with shamrocked signs. MEN FISHING near Castle Island.

Catholic SCHOOLKIDS playing in an asphalted schoolyard.

INT. LUNCH COUNTER. DAY

COSTELLO comes in. The shop is one that sells papers,

sundries, fountain drinks...and fronts a bookie operation.

CONTINUED:

The frightened proprietor hands over money. Fifty bucks, a

hundred, doesn't matter. COSTELLO is never the threatener.

His demeanor is gentle, philosophical. Almost a shrink's

probing bedside manner. He has great interest in the world

as he moves through it. As if he originally came from a

different world and his survival in this one depends on close

continual observation and analysis.

YOUNG COLIN looks up. CLOSE ON his eyes. He is fourteen or

fifteen, but small for his age. Bookish.

COSTELLO eyes the proprietor's TEENAGE DAUGHTER, working

behind the counter. He takes a propane lighter, and,

strangely, pays for it (the proprietor startled) and waits

for change. He lights a MORE cigarette with the lighter.

The PROPRIETOR is uneasy. COSTELLO turns to YOUNG COLIN

(about 14) staring at the local hero. Costello reaches up

above and behind the counter and takes down some cigarettes.

COLIN nods.

COLIN nods.

COSTELLO tells the Proprietor to takes three loaves of bread

and some soup off the shelves and puts them in Colin's bag.

He goes over to the fridge and puts two half gallons of milk

in the bag. Some soup. Costello turns to Colin.

CONTINUED: (2)

Colin nods.   He adds a couple of comic books.

When the PROPRIETOR looks at him, he takes out the money he

put in his pocket and gives back half.

YOUNG COLIN nods, holding the big bag of loot.

He gives some money to Carmen.

Looks intently at COLIN to see if he gets it.    Colin does.

COLIN nods: everybody does.

He pushes out with the bags of groceries.

The PROPRIETOR can do shit about it.

YOUNG COSTELLO watches YOUNG COLIN go off down a slummy

street.

INT. A CHURCH. MORNING. 1985-ISH

YOUNG COLIN, the good boy, the very good boy, is serving at a

funeral Mass. Various views of the church. Stained-glass

light. The altar is still wreathed in the smoke of incense.

CONTINUED:

CLOSE on COLIN'S face.

A liturgical bell tings.

INT. THE AUTOBODY SHOP. DAY

COSTELLO is talking informally (we realize that this is a

continuation of the philosophical talk, the shadowy pacing).

YOUNG KIDS. Useful young men. YOUNG COLIN, three years older,

is among them.

YOUNG COLIN, the recent altar boy, visibly doesn't go for

that sort of thing.

CONTINUED:

EXT. A REMOTE BEACH. DAWN

Rose-colored dawn. YOUNG COSTELLO, with a pistol, executes a

MAN kneeling in the surf. She falls on the body of a man who

has just been executed.

FRENCH moves forward with an axe in his hand.

They go about their business.

INT. THE AUTOBODY SHOP. DAY

YOUNG COSTELLO walking, talking...Not continuous with the

above. We see that only YOUNG COLIN is present.

MISTER FRENCH is doing books off behind a window of dirty

glass.

very close on COSTELLO, holding Colin's shoulder.

ECU: COLIN'S EYES swerve up. We are now on (MATURE) COLIN'S

EYES eyes. This is how the character transits the "age

leap"...on the unchanging eyes.

THE SAME EYES.

Pull back to reveal:

POLICE TRAINEES. (INCLUDING BARRIGAN, who is included in all

Colin's trainee scenes). COLIN is in the class, wearing a

trainee's uniform. He has a notebook, a pen. Writing.

COLIN writes.

INT. FIRING RANGE. DAY

POLICE TRAINEES ON A FIRING RANGE. As we go along the line we

see COLIN, firing dry and then speed-changing a clip in a

BERETTA 92F. He is a perfect trainee.

EXT. A TRAINING FIELD. DAY

STATE POLICE TRAINEES standing in a pissing rain, a DI

yelling at them OS. COLIN is staring forward. RAIN streaming

down his face. His opinion on the experience is not

decipherable. Ad libs: "Sir, yes, sir."

EXT. THE BOSTON COMMON. DAY

Guys we recognize from the previous shots at the State Police

Academy (wearing Statie t-shirts), including COLIN and

BARRIGAN, are playing rugby against some FIREFIGHTERS. Very

rough game. The game breaks up with each group giving each

other the finger. FIREFIGHTERS are moving away triumphantly.

COLIN sits on a bench looking at THE GOLD DOME OF BEACON

HILL. The terraces of fine townhouses. Aqueous golden light

behind. Misty golden beauty.

CONTINUED:

COLIN doesn't have a great sense of humor but he knows how to

pretend that he does. He smiles.

EXT. STATE POLICE GRADUATION CEREMONY. DAY

Bagpipes and bullshit. Flags cracking. Line after line of

paramilitary-looking graduates, among them COLIN.

CAMERA swirls around COLIN as he moves, a lone person,

through the breaking up crowd. Other graduates are hugged by

family. COLIN, alone, comes to the gates of the yard.

The bagpipe band plays "Minstrel Boy."

COLIN'S POV:

AN OLDSMOBILE. COSTELLO and MISTER FRENCH standing by the

car.

CONTINUED:

COLIN walks over to the car. COSTELLO gives COLIN a BOX.

COLIN flips open the top and then quickly closes it. NOTE:

The box could contain an eyeball, money, drugs, a picture of

Colin fucking his school teacher...we will never know.

INT. AN EXAMINATION ROOM. DAY

TITLE: FOUR YEARS LATER

A test is reversed on a desk lit with fluorescents. BILLY

takes up a Number Two pencil. He is in a room full of

trainees, far enough along in their traineeship that their

hair has grown in.

A CLOCK TICKS, sweep hand coming around.

BILLY'S EYES on it.

BILLY takes the test, marking multiple choice answers swiftly

while all around him trainees are sweating and still trying

to read the questions.

EXT. A TRACK. DAY

BILLY, wearing a State Police sweatshirt is running,

alongside BROWN a black trainee with specs.

CONTINUED:

BROWN is left thinking about this.

EXT. TRAINING FIELD. DAY

BILLY with other trainees is being braced by a DI.

INT. FIRING RANGE. DAY

BILLY, in glasses and ear-protectors, waiting for the target.

Go from the GUN to

INT. A CRACKHOUSE. DAY.

COLIN, four years a veteran of the gang unit, is on the job,

on a raid, clearing rooms, part of a team working with

massive aggression. He moves through a door. A SAD SACK OF

SHIT is throwing drugs out a window.

COPS enter past Colin and pigpile the man. COLIN is chewing

gum, all testosterone and aggression, glad to be a cop. The

smartest guy in the room.

EXT. FIRING RANGE. DAY

BILLY fires, and changes clips.

EXT. A STREET IN BOSTON. DAY

A BLACK-WINDOWED, MODERN, POLICE BUILDING, beetling over a

plaza. Older Boston reflected in the featureless glass. The

Boston of this film is almost futuristic. COLIN looks up at

the building with great intensity. He puts on his sunglasses

and walks towards the door.

INT. QUEENAN'S OFFICE. DAY

COLIN, in civvies (a very good suit), stands at suave

attention before CAPTAIN QUEENAN, a mild and scholarly man

who might as well be a Jesuit history-teacher.

CONTINUED:

He turns to go.

INT. QUEENAN'S OFFICE WAITING ROOM. DAY

As COLIN leaves the office, looking very satisfied and not a

little saturnine (it's not as if he isn't pleased by

recognition and it's not as if he won't get revenge on

Dignam), he barely glances--and does not actually see--the

TRAINEE sitting off to one side. He sees polished brogues,

and walks on.

As COLIN leaves she moderates her expression and:

BILLY looks up. He has not seen COLIN, and COLIN has not seen

him. He has his interview on his mind.

INT. QUEENAN'S OFFICE. MOMENTS LATER

BILLY stands at attention. The picture of a spit-and-polish

trainee.

BILLY does.

CONTINUED:

BILLY has no idea why he is in this room with the brass.

Sgt. Dignam is staring at him aggressively, with contempt,

stirring his coffee. DIGNAM is more intelligent than he

seems.

BILLY doesn't want to answer unless he can answer correctly.

BILLY wouldn't normally take crap from this guy; but he does.

He's openly intrigued by the situation. Dignam is staring at

him. BILLY looks evenly at QUEENAN.

CONTINUED: (2)

BILLY says slowly:

BILLY says nothing. Eyes luminous.

INT. CORRIDOR POLICE BUILDING. DAY

COLIN, in his good suit, moves along the hall. He owns the

building. He looks into offices. He is looking at his future.

From one room BARRIGAN (still working in uniform) gives him

the thumbs up. COLIN gets a coffee. He looks at a secretary's

ass. Caught at it, he smiles beautifully. She smiles back.

CONTINUED:

Meaning to some extent "Perfect for a dick like you". This is

how friends come apart. BARRIGAN is unable to continue his

pose of congratulation. COLIN (close on Colin) is on to him.

INT. QUEENAN'S OFFICE. DAY

BILLY is still at attention. DIGNAM going with wet thumb

through papers.

QUEENAN is inspecting Billy, watching his reactions. Specs

catching light.

INT. OCS CONFERENCE ROOM. CONTINUOUS

COLIN is eyeing a woman COP across the table. She smiles at

him and lowers her eyes. At the end of the table:

CONTINUED:

SURVEILLANCE PHOTOS come up. COSTELLO in sunglasses standing

in front of the Autobody shop. COSTELLO standing with UNCLE

JACKIE COSTIGAN.

PHOTO OF JACKIE'S DEMISE: PHOTO OF JACKIE, DEAD.

MORE RECENT PHOTOS. FITZY, DELAHUNT, FRENCH, all photographed

with COSTELLO. Coming out of buildings, talking on the

street, getting into cars.

A picture of COSTELLO comes up. COLIN looks at it. In the MUG

SHOT Costello is serene, untouchable legally, untouchable at

the heart. He's like a hilarious devil.

CONTINUED: (2)

The recruits disperse into a glittering modern office. COLIN,

in his flash suit, gets a cup of coffee. He looks at the

BRIEFING BOOK. He opens to a picture of COSTELLO.

INT. QUEENAN'S OFFICE. DAY

DIGNAM still working Billy.

Dignam leans over Billy.

BILLY, opened up expertly and crudely, stares with contained

hatred.

CONTINUED:

SGT. DIGNAM (although he knows perfectly well who Hawthorne

is) makes a fart-noise with his mouth. BILLY looks at him

with an "I'm going to kill you" expression which is not

without wit and which Dignam seems to admire.

CONTINUED: (2)

BILLY looks at him, and then looks forward.

CLOSE ON BILLY.

CONTINUED: (3)

EXT. HUNTINGTON AVENUE. LATE DAY

A TROLLEY goes past. HOSPITAL HILL, above the trolley line,

is sinister, quiet. HOSPITAL at the top like a malign

fortress, above rows of endlessly repeated condominiums.

BILLY CROSSES from the Trolley stop, desperately, an angry

young man at his life's turning point.

INT. A HOSPITAL ROOM. LATER

BILLY'S MOTHER lies as if floating in her bed. Tubes, lights.

A bald head on a barely-dented pillow. She is a cancer

patient in a coma, weighing possibly 80 lbs. Gasping for air.

Her airways are cleared with a suction tube. BILLY sits

watching as the tube goes in. BILLY sits looking at her.

EXT. THE HOSPITAL CORRIDOR. LATER

BILLY is leaning against a wall. A maternal WASP UNCLE, a not-

bright guy (pretensions, rather than status), speaks briefly

to a DOCTOR further along the hall, then approaches BILLY,

hands in the pocket of a good suit.

CONTINUED:

THE UNCLE moves away, bends to get his overcoat.

EXT. BOSTON. TWILIGHT

AERIAL. FLY FROM the HOSPITAL TO:

THE GOLD DOME ON BEACON HILL

INT. AN APARTMENT ON BEACON HILL. TWILIGHT

A REALTOR switches on lights. An empty, flash apartment above

the Parisian rooftops of Beacon Hill. A view of the Dome.

More than you'd think a cop could afford. We see, as COLIN

does, beyond his reflection in the glass, the STATE HOUSE

DOME.

CONTINUED:

EXT. HOSPITAL HILL OVERLOOK. NIGHT

BILLY sits on a bench looking out over the whole city. (It is

the best view of Boston, never seen in a film). He's smoking

a cigarette, making his decision.

INT. QUEENAN'S OFFICE.    DAY

Continuation of the interview.

CONTINUED:

QUEENAN writes on a slip of paper and hands it to BILLY.

BILLY looks up from the paper, impressed.

BILLY looks up with a glazed insolence. In one beat he is not

a scared trainee but a smart criminal.

EXT. HOSPITAL HILL OVERLOOK. NIGHT

BILLY throws down his cigarette. He has decided.

FILM TITLE:     THE DEPARTED

EXT. CEMETERY. DAY

Priest's cassock whipping in the wind. A few mourners (shabby

genteel ladies, contemporaries of his mother), but Billy

seems to have no real connection with any of them.

LATER

BILLY is alone at the grave. He looks at the tags on wind-

blown wreaths. One gives him pause. Under a picture of The

Virgin it reads: "Heaven holds the Faithful Departed" and is

signed: "F. Costello".

INT. JAIL HOLDING TANK. DAY

A CELL DOOR CLOSES. On Billy. Looking like a real criminal.

Not a pretend one. Frightened and resolute at once. BILLY is

in a holding tank.

EXT. THE BALCONY OF COLIN'S APARTMENT. MORNING

COLIN, in a bathrobe, leans on the rail and looks at Boston.

THE GOLD DOME visible. Colin drinks coffee. Not satisfied:

worried.

INT. A PROCESSING FACILITY. DAY

BILLY, naked, holds his clothes in a bundle. Being processed

out of jail. Beside him another guy, furtive, gruff, not

trying to be friendly.

Billy gets his clothes.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM. DAY

On the wall is a rogues gallery of COSTELLO and all his

primary guys...MISTER FRENCH, DELAHUNT, FITZY. COLIN and

others sitting listening. COLIN, reading a paper (Boston

Herald) which may or may not have the headline, CASE DROPPED

AGAINST DRUGS CADET (featuring a picture of Billy), looks up

as SGT. DIGNAM comes in.

LAZIO, the Fed, comes in and sits down. With folders, pencil.

CONTINUED:

COLIN stands down, embarrassed.

CONTINUED: (2)

EXT. A STREET OF TENEMENTS IN SOUTHIE. DAY

BILLY steps off a bus at a corner. He goes up to a house, and

knocks on the door. A Southie hag answers. On an oxygen

cylinder, smoking.

BILLY nods.

His aunt takes her cigarette out of her mouth and then

embraces him fiercely. BILLY takes it like the imposter he

is. But he might well love his aunt.

INT. BILLY'S AUNT'S KITCHEN. DAY

BILLY is eating soup.

CONTINUED:

Sean is a villain leaning in a doorway. Bad tie: he takes it

off. He has been at a funeral.

It's true. They are on the table.

Sean opens the fridge, opens a beer, and hands it to BILLY.

He opens one for himself.

EXT. THE PORCH OF THE THREE-DECKER. LATER

Sean and BILLY are still drinking beer.

Sean looks deflated.

Sean nods, and nods.

CONTINUED:

INT. BILLY'S CAR. NIGHT

BILLY is waiting. Sean comes out of a squalid looking house

and gets into a car. Fast. Billy puts the car in gear.

He has a paper bag full of money. He opens a beer.

They drive past a BPD cruiser. Sean hides his beer.

BILLY laughs.

INT. A HORRIBLE BAR IN SOUTHIE. NIGHT

Sean, beyond wasted, is talking to some people, including

MISTER FRENCH. A table wet with spilled beer.

They solemnly toast uncle Jackie and his fate among the

fucking guineas. Across the crowded room, BILLY is ordering

at the bar.

BILLY glances over at the table where MISTER FRENCH sits with

SEAN, and then smashes his glass into the face of the WELL

DRESSED SCUMBAG. He stands waiting for the SCUMBAG to get up

he is grabbed and shoved against the wall by MISTER FRENCH.

Popped into a pay phone hard. The pay phone comes off the

hook.

CONTINUED:

BILLY shakes his head no.

A beat: they stare at each other.

A beat.

BILLY laughs.

CONTINUED: (2)

The WELL-DRESSED SCUMBAG is bleeding, incredulous. MISTER

FRENCH takes him by the shoulder.

FRENCH demolishes him with body blows.

EXT. A HOUSING PROJECT IN SOUTHIE. DAY

COLIN and BARRIGAN (who Colin has moved to plain clothes)

stand at the door, talking, or trying to talk, with a fearful

MRS KENNEFICK. MRS KENNEFICK looks like she starts drinking

whiskey at 9 in the morning.

MRS. KENNEFICK notices COSTELLO driving by.

INT. COSTELLO'S CAR. DAY.

Costello and Gwen are in the car.    Gwen is dressed like

Jackie O.

EXT. A HOUSING PROJECT IN SOUTHIE. DAY.

She slams the door. As COLIN walks away from the door he

notices the TAIL: a maroon sedan and a damaged white delivery

van.

EXT. AN INTERSECTION. MOMENTS LATER

FRENCH pulls up to a light.

[COSTELLO blows a red light and leaves the tail (including

the Surveillance Van which we will see again) behind him in a

snarl of traffic.]

French steps on it and blows through the light, leaving the

follow cars behind.

INT. THE ELEVATOR AT POLICE HEADQUARTERS. DAY

COLIN boards with a bunch of other cops and workers. On

board, directly beside him, is MADOLYN. COLIN's age,

beautiful, wearing a business suit. She has a thick stack of

medical-looking files. She's a psychiatrist on contract to

the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. She does probation

counselling work with "violent offenders" and also sees

policemen.

CONTINUED:

MADOLYN nods, and then because this is a (relatively)

sensitive subject ignores COLIN, but she is visibly attracted

by him.

MADOLYN laughs.

The door opens.

After she steps out he prevents the door from closing.

CONTINUED: (2)

MADOLYN hands him a card.

She hesitates. He takes the card.

The doors close. The elevator takes him up. He takes out his

cellphone as if he's forgotten something. As the doors open,

the signal bars light up, and the phone rings.

CONTINUED: (3)

INT. A COFFEE SHOP IN SOUTHIE. MORNING

The same shop in which YOUNG COSTELLO talked to YOUNG COLIN,

all those years ago. Two ITALIANS are in the shop, talking

hard to the Pakistani PROPRIETOR (SINGH). These are hard guys

but they're not being threatening, just persistent: the guy

DOES owe them money. BILLY is finishing his breakfast.

Watching. He goes over. The two GUINEAS are amazed. [Dialog

on separate document].

Billy is finishing his breakfast. Watching. He goes over....

The GUINEAS look at him. The younger one moves to intervene.

BILLY smiles and destroys them both. Maniacal violence. The

biggest beatdown in gangster movie history--and obviously

that's saying something. In the course of the beat-down Billy

breaks his left hand--a "boxer's fracture". BILLY stands over

his victims, breathing hard, holding his broken hand.

BILLY goes.

INT. EMERGENCY ROOM. NIGHT

BILLY, unlit cigarette in his mouth, is having his hand

wrapped in plaster by a lady doctor. In another life he might

have dated her. Not in this one.

INT. FRENCH RESTAURANT. NIGHT

A romantic restaurant. The best Boston has (which isn't

saying much, but whatever). COLIN, looking great, a man on

the rise. MADOLYN in pearls, also looking great. But maybe

the conversation has lapsed and the date gone south.

CONTINUED:

COLIN wonders if she's breaking his balls. A DESSERT arrives:

some towering Japanesey concoction with a fan of sugar candy

spines, sitting in a pool of sauce. COLIN looks at it, fork

poised. MADOLYN looks at it. He looks up at her.

MADOLYN smiles: she likes him. Even with the dinner-long

bitterness over the duck l'orange.

The look at the dessert.

MADOLYN laughs.    COLIN sees his shot: he's got her laughing.

CONTINUED: (2)

Colin stares at her.    Water glass nearly goes over.

MADOLYN is impressed.

COLIN laughs but looks nervous about the concept of "opening

up".

CONTINUED: (3)

COLIN takes it seriously; admires it.

Unsaid: Like I do.

INT. A HORRIBLE BAR IN SOUTHIE. NIGHT

A slow night. BILLY IS AT THE BAR bent over a glass of

cranberry juice. The women available are two CRONES. [Dialog

on separate document]. Stark contrast to COLIN'S EVENING. A

BOOKMAKER on the phone. BILLY, by the glances of people

looking at him, has made his bones. He's treated with

respect. His hand and wrist in a cast. Out of nowhere (though

Billy is aware conversation has stopped he does not look

around)...

COSTELLO sits down beside him AT THE BAR.

BILLY observes:

MISTER FRENCH sitting down at a far table. Watching. Covering

the room.

COSTELLO is brought a glass of water by the silent bartender.

No sound whatsoever in the bar.

CONTINUED:

They say nothing, look at each other. BILLY notices DELAHUNT

and FITZY, entering. They stand by MISTER FRENCH.

BILLY sits motionless.

BILLY does: but shakes his head.

BILLY stands up. MISTER FRENCH stands up. BILLY, COSTELLO,

and MISTER FRENCH move towards the back room. As they walk to

the back room of the bar, we hear COSTELLO:

INT. BACK ROOM OF THE BAR. CONTINUOUS.

CONTINUED:

COSTELLO appreciates the balls of this. He looks at Mister

French. Then back at Billy, smiling.

BILLY tenses. Exactly as he might if he were wearing a wire.

MISTER FRENCH and COSTELLO look at each other.

BILLY slips out of them. MISTER FRENCH inspects the shoes.

COSTELLO'S cold eyes are on BILLY. MISTER FRENCH searches

BILLY. Looks into his wallet. The wallet is emptied onto a

table.

CONTINUED: (2)

COSTELLO turns to MISTER FRENCH.

With amazing violence MISTER FRENCH smashes the cast on the

corner of a table. Billy drops to his knees in tears of pain.

MISTER FRENCH sorts through the pieces of the cast. Ad libs:

"such a fuckin' pussy."

He grabs Billy's broken right hand.

COSTELLO twists Billy's broken hand.

CONTINUED: (3)

COSTELLO lets go of Billy's hand. Billy is weeping on the

floor. COSTELLO straightens his suit.

INT. THE MAIN PART OF THE BAR. MOMENTS LATER

COSTELLO, the visiting king, points at a group of drinkers,

including a BLOND WOMAN (1st), GWEN.

The IRA MOTHERFUCKER is terrified.

Costello exits.

INT. COSTELLO'S APARTMENT. NIGHT

MISTER FRENCH is methodically shelling and eating peanuts.

CONTINUED:

And he is.

SILENT FLASH of MISTER FRENCH strangling his wife with a wire

in a 70's bathroom.

GWEN looks up:

EXT. LYNN MARSHLAND. DAWN

SEAGULLS squabble over unusual food. POWER PLANT IN THE

DISTANCE, the MTA-train going by. TWO BODIES lie in a tidal

ditch in the salt-marsh. They are the Italians who Billy

fought in the restaurant. Hands taped together behind their

backs. Two in the head each. COLIN is with the LYNN POLICE

and the State Police forensics people. COLIN gets down and

lifts a soaking lapel. Revealed is the tag of a men's shop in

Providence.

COLIN gets up. He walks back across the marsh. Opens his cell

phone.

At a PAY PHONE he dials another number.

INT. COSTELLO'S CONDOMINIUM ON THE HARBOR. MORNING

One of Costello's homes.

BILLY cannot hear what COSTELLO is saying. He has an aluminum

brace taped on his wrist and hand.

CONTINUED:

EXT. LYNN MARSHLAND. CONTINUOUS

COLIN deadpan, appreciative, hangs up the phone. BARRIGAN

walks in the middle distance, giving the man his privacy.

INT. COSTELLO'S CONDOMINIUM ON THE HARBOR. MORNING

COSTELLO sits down in the breakfast area in his bathrobe. He

has a bowl of cornflakes.

BILLY sits. MISTER FRENCH are nearby.

COSTELLO and MISTER FRENCH look at each other.

COSTELLO lifts a piece of plastic on the table revealing a

severed human hand. BILLY tries to conceal his shock.

INT. SURVEILLANCE OFFICE. CONTINUOUS

QUEENAN and STAFF SGT. DIGNAM are listening to the live

broadcast. QUEENAN is benign. Lights of equipment in his

specs.

INT. A CONDOMINIUM ON THE HARBOR. CONTINUOUS.

COSTELLO takes the ring off the finger of the severed hand.

Partial exchange with MISTER FRENCH. BILLY watches.

He gets up.

INT. COSTELLO'S BATHROOM. DAY

BILLY runs the water in the sink. He starts to leave the

bathroom and then impulsively takes off his wire and chucks

it out the window as far as he can.

EXT. THE BUILDING. DAY

The wire falls into the water.

INT. SURVEILLANCE OFFICE. CONTINUOUS.

Queenan reacts mildly to the loss of the signal. He removes

his headphones.

EXT. "ACROPOLIS RESTAURANT". DAY

A GREEK GUY (JIMMY PAPPAS) in chef's whites is cuffed and

stuffed by TACTICAL OFFICERS. He has no idea what is going

on. COLIN and BARRIGAN follow.

CONTINUED:

EXT. A STREET BY THE HARBOR. DAY

BILLY walking and talking on the phone.

INT. SURVEILLANCE OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Queenan on the phone.

EXT. POLICE BUILDING. DAY. TELEVISION IMAGE.

ELLERBY is before a thicket of microphones.

INT. COLIN'S OFFICE #1. DAY

COLIN is rolling a quarter across the backs of his fingers.

BROWN (last seen as Billy's friend) and BARRIGAN, new

plainclothes recruits to Colin's special squad, sit across

from him.

CONTINUED:

Through glass we see ELLERBY, preening. ELLERBY gives the

thumbs up.

BROWN and BARRIGAN leave.       Colin leaves as well.

CONTINUED: (2)

COLIN opens his cell phone.

INT. A BOOKIE SHOP. DAY

MISTER FRENCH backhands a guy into a table of betting slips.

BILLY, who is not wearing a cast anymore, watches.

A HARD GUY sitting reaches inside his coat. BILLY in a flash

breaks his jaw with a pistol barrel and then covers the

sprawled HARD GUY with the gun.

He was. They fall from his fingers.

CONTINUED:

EXT. THE STREET OUTSIDE THE BOOKIE SHOP. LATER

BILLY and MISTER FRENCH emerge.

They get into COSTELLO'S CAR. Billy in the front seat. Mister

French in the back.

COSTELLO does an Edgar Kennedy.

CONTINUED:

He takes out a cell phone and hands it to BILLY.

INT. A HARBOR RESTAURANT. BOSTON. DAY

A lobster-bib kind of place. DAYTIME DRINKERS, MICKS in bad

boat shoes, hyper-aware of... COSTELLO and BILLY in a back

table. COSTELLO, having finished his lunch, is drawing. Billy

is unused to being the subject of so many stares. He has sort

of a coked-out nervousness, dirty hair.

WE see it through the smeared glass: the WHITE VAN we always

see. This time with a different magnetic business sign.

BILLY registers what seems to be inside information.

COSTELLO looks over his half-glasses at Billy's untouched

food. COSTELLO is sizing Billy up: has been thinking about

him.

BILLY shrugs. Indicating: Yeah, well, who the fuck wouldn't

be.

CONTINUED:

TWO PRIESTS and a NUN are sitting two tables over. An older

priest and a younger one. COSTELLO notices. THE NUN gets up

and leaves.

COSTELLO smiles at this, then looks at his sketch.

CONTINUED: (2)

He gets up and leaves the table, leaving BILLY sitting there.

COSTELLO stops to speak to the priests.

The OLDER PRIEST is very nervous, looking around. The YOUNGER

PRIEST concerned for his elder but personally not implicated.

COSTELLO leans over the OLDER PRIEST, a pathetic man.

COSTELLO notices that THE NUN is heading back to the table.

INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

FITZY beats up a guy with a pipe.   Billy watches from the

background.

EXT. WATERFRONT - NIGHT

FITZY and the Costello gang blow up a car as Billy watches.

Laughing, they hop in their vehicles and drive off.

INT. ELLERBY'S OFFICE. MORNING

OFFICE decorated with golf implements. ELLERBY has a

hangover. Sunglasses. Eating baby aspirin by the small

fistful.

He has a bowl of ice water on his desk.

ELLERBY stares at COLIN.

CONTINUED:

He drops his face into the bowl of ice water.

INT. BILLY'S MOTHER'S APARTMENT. MORNING

A stripped HOSPITAL BED stands in a fall of light. This is

the apartment where his mother became ill. Billy has packed

half of his mother's things into boxes--and then stopped.

Billy doesn't use the bedroom. He sleeps on the couch among

boxes of pictures, papers, teacups wrapped in newspaper.

BILLY is sitting on the couch. He reaches into a box and lays

out photographs like cards. Scenes from his life. His former

life. His family life, his life as a child, his romantic

life. He sits and stares at the pictures. He rearranges the

photographs in different ways.

NOTE: THIS IS A MEMORY BILLY HAS AS HE IS LOOKING AT

PHOTOGRAPHS ON HIS MOTHER'S APARTMENT.

FRENCH and BILLY break in, surprising the MAN (BRIAN), seated

at his dining room table. He throws a child's toy at them.

FRENCH ducks out of the way and the toy hits BILLY in the

cheek.

FRENCH draws his pistol and approaches the table. BRIAN

rises and starts to flee. Cut off, he retreats the other

way.

CONTINUED:

He fires, using a soda bottle as a silencer. BRIAN drops to

the floor. FRENCH approaches him assessing his victim.

He turns to leave, passing BILLY.     He give him a slap.

They leave.

EXT. A BEACH NEAR A POWERPLANT. DAY

BILLY leans against the wall of a concession stand. His

knuckles are cut. A cut over his eye. He is agitated.

Smoking. A car pulls up and Queenan and Dignam get out of it.

In appearance, if anybody's watching, they're bracing Billy.

Dignam is drinking coffee.

This is Billy's deepest fear.

CONTINUED:

He gets free of DIGNAM and punches him.

The fight. QUEENAN grabs Billy and holds him against the

wall.

BILLY looks desperately inland.

REVERE BEACH condominium buildings. A thousand empty

terraces, five thousand empty windows. BILLY is desperate.

They do.

BILLY nods, out of it. DIGNAM is looking at blood on his

hands in disbelief.

CONTINUED: (2)

BILLY shakes his head.

BILLY nods reluctantly.

INT. OBSERVATION OFFICE. DAY

COLIN walks into the office. BROWN and other team members are

watching a closed-circuit monitor. The MONITOR shows FITZY

sitting in an interrogation room. COLIN is spooked.

COLIN glances around and sees: a briefcase lying on a desk.

He picks it up. He takes off his ID badge and tosses it on a

desk.

CONTINUED:

He takes Brown's cellphone out of Brown's pocket goes into

the interrogation room.

He picks up a BRIEFCASE. BARRIGAN touches two buttons and

switches off the sound recorder and video feed. COLIN goes

into the interrogation room.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM. CONTINUOUS

FITZY looks up at COLIN hopefully. COLIN says nothing. He

sits down, opens his case, takes out a yellow pad.

ON FITZY. He looks up at the CCTV camera.

CONTINUED:

Fitzy hesitates.

COLIN puts a cellphone on the table. FITZY takes up the phone

and punches in a number. It is answered.

INT. A HOUSE WHERE DRUGS ARE BEING HANDLED. CONTINUOUS

BILLY looks up at MISTER FRENCH, who is on the phone. Other

men are frozen, holding bags of Ex.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM. CONTINUOUS.

FITZY closes the cellphone. He puts it into COLIN'S hand.

INT. A HOUSE WHERE DRUGS ARE BEING HANDLED. CONTINUOUS

The DRUGS are swept up instantly, in sheets laid over the

tables. MISTER FRENCH lights a cigarette with his ZIPPO, and

then reaches out and lights the curtains on fire as BILLY

watches.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM. CONTINUOUS.

COLIN takes the cellphone and puts it in his pocket.

CONTINUED:

INT. OBSERVATION OFFICE.CONTINUOUS

COLIN comes out and hands BROWN the CELLPHONE.

INT. COLIN'S APARTMENT - DAY

COLIN, hung-over, sits at the breakfast table.     Madolyn looks

at him.

COLIN doesn't respond.

COLIN simply gets up and walks away.

INT. MADOLYN'S OFFICE. DAY

A clock ticking. Madolyn is looking across at ...Billy.

Madolyn is very much a guarded shrink. But no one's more

guarded than Billy.

CONTINUED:

A beat.

MADOLYN looks up at him, transpierced. Tables turned on the

psychiatrist. BILLY smiles at her.

CONTINUED: (2)

CONTINUED: (3)

Madolyn is taken aback. She closes her file.

She closes his file and puts it in the rack behind her.

CONTINUED: (4)

She retrieves his folder.

MADOLYN stares at him, then lowers her eyes, takes out a

small packet of two pills. She hands it over to him. BILLY

looks at it.

She nods. BILLY reaches out and deliberately places the pills

on the desk.

MADOLYN is taken aback, guilty, astonished.

CONTINUED: (5)

BILLY leaves. MADOLYN stares after him.

EXT. PLAZA OUTSIDE THE OFFICE BUILDING. DAY

Very windy. Papers blowing. Billy is walking. Madolyn catches

up to him.

Madolyn holds out a paper and a business card.

BILLY stands holding the prescription.

CONTINUED:

She starts to go back inside.

INT. COMMAND CENTER (UPSTAIRS). NIGHT. A WEEK LATER

It's an otherwise disused floor of a new luxury office

building. Cables and monitors and computers everywhere. It's

crawling with State Cops as well as FBI (LAZIO is present,

very nattily dressed). COLIN comes in with BROWN and

BARRIGAN. This operation is all new to Colin.

No.

CONTINUED:

ON COLIN as he reflexively touches his cell phone and thinks

about the best way out of this.

COLIN wanders off in the mill of officers. He is taking out

his cell phone when ELLERBY comes up to him.

ELLERBY walks on to a COFFEE STATION, a yard away.

COLIN is completely normal on the phone.

INT. COSTELLO'S APARMENT. CONTINUOUS

COSTELLO is on the phone.

INT. COMMAND CENTER. CONTINUOUS

COLIN turns away from the activity.

COLIN sees QUEENAN staring at him.

COLIN ends the call. QUEENAN is there.

He gives him the clipboard, Colin goes to the work area.

LATER

COLIN joins his team (BROWN AND BARRIGAN), who are seated in

a U shaped work-area. COLIN, still stunned by the fact of

this operations center, swallows as he notices on video three

angles of a building he seems to know very well. He sits down

and puts a headset on. A GEEK COP leans over and shakes his

hand.

COLIN nods. QUEENAN comes up.

COLIN looks: sees LAZIO and two others.

CONTINUED:

COLIN, using his left hand, not looking, opens his cellphone,

autodials, and then taps an instant message into it, pushes

"Send."

DETAIL OF IM: "No Phones"

ONSCREEN, CARS PULL UP IN FRONT OF THE TARGET BUILDING.

DETAIL OF COLIN'S PHONE. COLIN hits "send", sending the

message "No phones". THE SCREEN then reads "Erasing Sent

Message".

EXT. TARGET BUILDING. NIGHT

COSTELLO and the boys go into the building, moving past TWO

IDLING CARS. We see Costello look casually at his phone.

INT. COMMAND CENTER. CONTINUOUS

Watching images. COSTELLO'S GUYS move through pillars and

disappear.

CONTINUED:

Ellerby blows his nose. He is on coke. COLIN sends another

TEXT MESSAGE: "Blind spot inside door."

INT. TARGET BUILDING. CONTINUOUS - REVISED 6/8-9/05

COSTELLO looks at his IM screen and turns to his guys.

FITZY and some others mutter.

Everyone turns off their phones, including BILLY (but we know

Billy has TWO phones).

BILLY looks around at the pillared distances. He sees:

A GROUP OF THREE MEN waiting and FIVE OTHER MEN spreading out

through the pillars. Armed.

INT. COMMAND CENTER. CONTINUOUS

Both Brown and Colin have their headsets on.

COLIN looks utterly innocent.

CONTINUED:

A single light on the screen. QUEENAN looks at an IM (from

Billy) on his phone.

DETAIL: "buyers here". ("$")

COLIN wonders how Queenan knew this. The single light winks

out on the screen. ELLERBY looks at Queenan, impressed.

ELLERBY stares at him.

CONTINUED: (2)

INT. AN OPEN AREA IN THE RUINED BUILDING. NIGHT

COSTELLO'S BOYS spread out. Across the open, lumber-strewn

area, CHINESE GANG MEMBERS are waiting.

A LOCAL CHINESE-AMERICAN MAN acting as the interpreter and

fixer stands waiting near a SUITCASE on the floor. With the

CHINESE GANGSTERS is a more official looking MAN IN A BAD

SUIT - terrified. FITZY carries a case containing the

processors.

COSTELLO takes it all in. The CHINESE GANGSTER looks like a

Malay pirate. Costello's gunmen are perched above, automatic

weapons trained on the Triad.

BILLY sneaks a message to Queenan via Text Message,"$" to

indicate "buyers here."

CONTINUED:

BILLY is watching carefully. [As (INSERT) ONSCREEN in the

OPERATIONS ROOM the last lights wink off...] He removes his

hand from his pocket, having just switched off his phone.

The CHINESE GANGSTER interjects --

The CHINESE TRANSLATOR translates Costello's statement about

"concern."

SEVERAL OF THE TRIAD, hearing a "automatic weapon," stupidly

raise their MACHINE GUNS. They don't aim them.

We (but no one else) hear a double click as MISTER FRENCH

cocks a pistol behind his back.

The MACHINE GUN is put away.

CONTINUED: (2)

The CHINESE TRANSLATOR translates.

COSTELLO gestures and a BOX of PROCESSORS is put on the

floor. Opened. The CHINESE GANGSTER gestures and a case of

money is put on the floor. Opened. FITZY looks at it, nods.

The deal is done.

To Billy's surprise both Costello's men and the Chinese head

out through the back industrial windows onto a canal-side

pier.

INT. COMMAND CENTER. CONTINUOUS

The CARS of the CHINESE GUYS are driven away, passing a van

full of...

Startled TACTICAL COPS. TWO TACTICAL UNITS are hidden

outside.

INT. COMMAND CENTER. CONTINUOUS

ELLERBY is staring at the screens.

An IMAGE comes up. Nothing.

As the Camera Technician gets up, Ellerby pounces on him.

EXT. BEHIND THE BUILDING. CONTINUOUS

Tied to the pier there are two boats, a NOVI LOBSTER BOAT and

a BOSTON WHALER with a guys we've never seen at the wheel

(random getaway hires). The TRIAD members get into the NOVI,

and chug away. Fitzy carries the SUITCASES OF MONEY onto a

BOSTON WHALER and it takes off. COSTELLO turns to Billy.

BILLY is stunned. Admiring.

CONTINUED:

The CHINESE GUYS, staring back, chug away down the canal in

the lobster boat. BILLY watches COSTELLO go, admiringly, and

then follows him.

EXT. STREET NEAR TARGET BUILDING - NIGHT          103A

A few blocks from the target building, a Police Tactical unit

stops the departing Triad cars with a roadblock. As officers

approach the cars they realize they are empty except for

hired Caucasian drivers. An officer reports this to the

command center.

INT. COLIN'S APARTMENT. DAY

Colin is asleep on the couch, in a bachelor disaster of

Chinese food boxes. Something on TV: "Audition." A key in

the door: He wakes as MADOLYN comes in carrying a bag of

coffees and a BOX OF EFFECTS.

MADOLYN smiles at him, also shy.

They kiss.    MADOLYN takes in the apartment.

CONTINUED:

MADOLYN unpacks food.       Coffee.   Croissants.

He sorts through the box. It's all Madolyn's key stuff - a

mug, a few critical books...framed family pictures,

breakables...and comes up with: A PHOTOGRAPH of a young

Madolyn standing in front of a North East rust belt slum.

MADOLYN isn't prepared to be at cross-purposes. But she is

taken aback. She puts the photo quietly away. Contaminated.

She laughs.    COLIN looks at a diploma.     Veritas.

CONTINUED: (2)

COLIN stares at her.

THE PHONE (landline with mobile handset) rings.

MADOLYN, not 100% confused by his seizing on the

interruption, gets the phone.

After a moment she holds the receiver out to COLIN.

COLIN reaches in his pocket and looks at his cellphone: dead.

A bad mistake in his situation. He crams the phone into a

table charger beside the landline and takes the handset.

CONTINUED: (3)

COLIN exits the kitchen.

MADOLYN looks after him. She doesn't start eating again, she

watches Colin. She is seen staring at him through the

following scene.

EXT. THE CHELSEA YACHT CLUB. CONTINUOUS

COSTELLO, with his collar turned up, is walking along the

floats. Wearing a headset.

INTERCUT TERRACE OF COLIN'S APARTMENT/CHELSEA YACHT CLUB.

CONTINUOUS

COLIN hunches, closing the glass door, and glancing in at

Madolyn.

CONTINUED:

COLIN looks in at MADOLYN.

COLIN is frustrated.

COLIN takes a breath, tries to reason and mind his place.

CONTINUED: (2)

EXT. DOCK/WATERFRONT - CONTINUOUS

Costello hangs up and walks along and sees QUEENAN and DIGNAM

step out.

COSTELLO, not liking that:

CONTINUED:

From off-stage we hear a young, angelic GIRLS CHOIR begin to

sing.

As Costello walks away:

INT. COLIN'S APARTMENT. CONTINUOUS

COLIN, looking worried, folding his phone away, comes into

the apartment. MADOLYN is staring at him.

CONTINUED:

COLIN looks at her steadily:         if she's serious, she's pure

gold.

He kisses her.       The DOORBELL RINGS.

The doorbell safely ringing, Colin kisses Madolyn.

INT. QUEENAN'S OFFICE. CONTINUOUS

DIGNAM is alone. We see Queenan's empty desk in a fall of

light. We see Dignam's arm, wrist, phone, an expensive heavy

watch.

CONTINUED:

INT. IM PEI TYPE FOOTBRIDGE WITH A PEDESTRIAN CONVEYOR. DAY

(INTERCUT)

BILLY is talking on the phone, in a fury.

BILLY is in a full-on panic attack. He takes a pill, leans

back against a wall, closes his eyes. The second phone rings.

He stares at it: opens it.

CONTINUED:

INT. DESERTED CAFE -     DAY

Madolyn and Billy sit at a table. Talking like friends now,

emphatically non-clinical. Billy is zoned out, preoccupied,

nervous.

CONTINUED:

He lifts his cup to drink.

This may not be exactly what Madolyn wants to hear. But she

nods.

Smiles, called on her shit.

She realizes she may have glazed and gone a little too far on

"problems".

INT./EXT. BANKROBBER'S APARTMENT. CHARLESTOWN. DAY

The BANKROBBER, a junkie, wakes up to a vision: JESUS,

indicating the sacred heart.

BILLY smashes the glass and the frame over the guy's head.

CUT TO OUTSIDE:

MISTER FRENCH has lit a cherry-bomb. He throws it. He hands

out fireworks to KIDS.

CONTINUED:

BACK INSIDE:

BILLY shoves him down on the couch and crams the gun to his

head.

{Firecrackers off}

Firecrackers continue to go off outside. The BANKROBBER knows

what this means.

CONTINUED: (2)

As the firecracker sounds increase outside (Maybe French's

"Do what you have to do"), BILLY, no way out of what he has

to do, glances at the window, shoots the guy through the

kneecap. BLOOD sprays everywhere. The bankrobber screams.

BILLY gets out of the house.

OUTSIDE

MISTER FRENCH is benignly watching kids light cherry bombs.

ON SOUND: Sextet from LUCIA di LAMMAMOOR.

INT. A THEATER. NIGHT

From behind COSTELLO'S HEAD, which almost fills the frame, we

see a blur of beautiful color. ON STAGE, an opera is in

progress----LUCIA DI LAMMAMOOR done with masks. CUT TO

COSTELLO, revealing Costello's rapt face and PAN to reveal on

his Left a beautiful WHITE PROSTITUTE. PAN back over

COSTELLO'S face to reveal a beautiful BLACK PROSTITUTE.

PERFORMERS with MASKS sing on stage. As the music soars,

COSTELLO moves crinolines up the women's legs.

INT. A BEDROOM. NIGHT.

COSTELLO fucks...and fucks weird.

EXT. QUEENAN'S HOUSE IN WEST ROXBURY. NIGHT

A street of three-deckers. QUEENAN gets out of his unmarked

cruiser. As he does: BILLY steps out into the light. The two

men stare at each other, each lit by their own streetlight.

QUEENAN approaches him.

QUEENAN stares.

INT. QUEENAN'S HOUSE. MOMENTS LATER

BILLY sits on a bench in a hallway, exhausted, staring. THE

SACRED HEART and JFK are on the walls. QUEENAN comes along

the hall.

BILLY shakes his head.

CONTINUED:

BILLY follows him towards the lighted kitchen door.

EXT. DRIVING RANGE. DAY (WINDY)

COLIN is watching ELLERBY hit golf balls. Well.

ELLERBY hits a drive.

CONTINUED:

Hits a drive. Ponk.

EXT. CONSTRUCTION AREA. DAY

HEAVY EQUIPMENT stands on the thrashed earth. Hoardings.

BILLY crosses the road under what remains of the Expressway,

and after hiding in an angle of the building and cocking the

gun in his pocket bangs on the door of a dead bar. The door

is unlocked by: DELAHUNT.

INT. THE DEAD BAR. DAY

It's another of COSTELLO'S "locations". BILLY looks around.

Every man from the previous night is there--but no COSTELLO.

DELAHUNT closes the door behind him and bars it. Men are

oddly enough filling out forms. These are not men used to

pencil and paper. Billy is nodded at.

CONTINUED:

MISTER FRENCH goes off into a separate room. BILLY takes a

paper and, sitting at the bar beside FITZY, writes down his

information. The other men are mostly finished and DELAHUNT

is collecting the papers. DELAHUNT tosses the brown envelope

on the bar.

BILLY glances at what FITZY is crawling: CITTIZINS TRUST.

He takes the brown envelope, and writes on it CITIZENS.

BILLY gives up. Both of their forms are stuffed in an

envelope. BILLY gets up.

CONTINUED: (2)

BILLY goes out. DELAHUNT puts his coat on. He picks up the

brown envelope on which CITIZENS TRUST is written.

EXT. THE WATERFRONT. DAY

BILLY is holding his bottle of tranqs. He traces with his

finger the doctor's name...MADOLYN MADDEN. His "police" phone

vibrates and he takes it out.

BILLY deletes the IM and dials Queenan directly.

INT. QUEENAN'S OFFICE. DAY

QUEENAN closes his door.

EXT. COSTELLO'S APARTMENT. NIGHT

Costello emerges, in an overcoat. Carrying the envelope. He

gets into his Oldsmobile. BILLY starts his car and follows.

INT. CINEMA. NIGHT   REVISED ON SET 5/31/05

Dark theater, movie in progress. Wobbly porno music. A thin

audience of raincoat artists. The door opens and COSTELLO

enters. He moves slowly down the aisle and sees: COLIN

sitting alone. He sits down in front of COLIN.

Costello is wearing the dildo.   He watches the movie,

moaning.

Colin goes for his gun.    Costello gets up, shows him the

dildo.

CONTINUED:

COLIN unnerved, recognizing COSTELLO now.

Frank sits, closer to Colin.

CONTINUED: (2)

COSTELLO chuckles, truly enjoying this.

We see in Colin's face hurt and hatred for Costello.   His

idol doesn't like him.

COLIN nods, sweat on his lip.

CONTINUED: (3)

Costello gets up to go.

The door opens again at the back of the theater and we see:

BILLY in a dark back seat. COSTELLO, after hesitating as

Colin sweats, shoves the brown envelope to COLIN, and goes.

BILLY receives a text message: "Get visual ID suspect." He

slumps in his seat as Costello marches up the aisle and out

of the theater. He has barely recovered from this when:

The dark shape of COLIN is moving rapidly towards and through

the emergency exit beside the screen.

Billy follows.

INT. CINEMA BACK STAIRCASE AND ALLEY. NIGHT

It's open, and gives on to what Boston keeps trying to call

the Theater District and what keeps being The Combat Zone.

COLIN vanishes around a corner. BILLY follows, looks left and

right, then goes after

EXT. A STREET OF CHINESE SHOPS. CONTINUOUS

COLIN, who is walking along, putting the envelope into his

coat.

BILLY is speeding up, moving through pedestrians, desperate

to see Colin's face.

COLIN will be caught up to within seconds. He turns down

another street. BILLY starts into a half-run. He turns the

corner.

ANOTHER STREET painted with neon light (quiet).

BILLY'S POV:

COLIN is halfway down the street.

CONTINUED:

BILLY follows.

BILLY is nearly up to COLIN on this quieter street

(And COLIN is aware of the tail)

when...

BILLY'S cellphone rings. His phone has fucked up, as they

do. Instead of turning around, COLIN accelerates. The only

thing on his agenda is to not have his face seen.

BILLY spins into a door-opening and silences the ringer.

COLIN takes a right at the end of the street, into an alley.

EXT. AROUND THE NEXT CORNER. MOMENTS LATER

COLIN is waiting, in a doorway of his own. He has a knife

open in his hand. He waits, listening to (faltering)

footsteps: a MAN, face invisible in shadow, turns the corner.

COLIN pulls him into the doorway and rips upwards with a

knife.

As the body falls we see: it isn't Billy. It's a CHINESE MAN.

COLIN backs away in horror, and hurries off down the street.

EXT. ANOTHER STREET. MOMENTS LATER

COLIN, sweating, staggering, hurries along. No sign of Billy,

no sign of a follower. But he does notice: CCTV cameras at

the intersection. He spins and gets out of there, heading off

through. CHINATOWN. Colin, holding his envelope, walks,

sweating, fast, then faster, past repeated ideograms in neon

(the ideograms say--flash--"Departed").

EXT. CHINATOWN. MOMENTS LATER

BILLY has lost Colin. He hears a hubbub from the corner where

a small crowd of Chinese speakers is gathering and pushes

through the crowd to see: blood running on the pavement.

BILLY backs away, gets out of there.

INT. CCTV ROOM. NIGHT

COLIN is looking at CCTV tapes. We see COLIN, unrecognizable

on cheap video. Then we see a blurred image of BILLY.

Crossing the street in beats. No more use as ID than the

Shroud of Turin.

EXT. MADOLYN'S CELLAR APARTMENT. NIGHT (RAINING)

Through grated windows we can see Madolyn finishing up her

packing. BILLY KNOCKS on the door, which leads only into

Madolyn's basement apartment. A long beat and she opens the

door. The chain on.

Billy gets soaked.

INT. MADOLYN'S CELLAR APARTMENT. CONTINUOUS

BILLY looks around and sees: boxes, transition. The furniture

already gone. An air-mattress on the floor. There are still

tea things on the counter. A basic life is still possible

here. Madolyn has been making tea here, sleeping here,

reading in bed. Billy, soaked, a drowned rat, is looking

vulnerable and honest.

MADOLYN takes a moment to react.

CONTINUED:

BILLY is looking at THE PICTURE to which Colin objected. A

young girl in front of a rust belt slum, tilted in a box of

effects.

He hangs the picture on a nail.

BILLY nods.

Madolyn leaves him looking vaguely around the apartment. In

the kitchen, it appears that Madolyn has forgotten how to

make a cup of tea. She perseveres, comes out holding two

cups. Billy is looking at the handful of books still in the

apartment.

She hands him the cup of tea. Strung out, he spills his tea,

slightly, unobserved by Madolyn. Madolyn looks over at the

bed, the book, the lamp, the incontrovertible evidence that

she's probably really, in fact, not that into Colin..

CONTINUED: (2)

Tick...tick...tick.

INT. CCTV ROOM. NIGHT

Colin is still studying the blurry image of Billy.

INT. MADOLYN'S BASEMENT APARTMENT. NIGHT

In the tiny kitchen BILLY is kissing MADOLYN and unbuttoning

her shirt. Her hands start to move to push him away. He

continues.

INT. CCTV ROOM. NIGHT

Still studying the blurry image of Billy, COLIN tenses as

someone comes into the office and switches off the tape. He

glances at his coat. The envelope is visible folded into the

breast pocket. He takes his coat and goes.

EXT. CHARLES STREET. NIGHT

Wet empty streets. The "gaslights" are on. About midnight.

INT. CHARLES STREET BRASSERIE. NIGHT

A Costello business. The restaurant is closed for the night.

One bartender is sweeping up and the other is counting the

takings. In a darker alcove of the bar COSTELLO sits alone at

a broad table, drinking brandy. On sound, classical music. As

a knocking is heard Costello looks up. A BARTENDER lets Billy

in. COSTELLO watches Billy approach. We hear him sit down.

He pours Billy some brandy. Then starts to draw a sketch.

CONTINUED:

But COSTELLO, maybe, is sorry.

COSTELLO looks up. This is new: but he's impassive. And

impressed.

COSTELLO smiles, and continues with the sketch.    Later he

will light up the paper.

CONTINUED: (2)

COSTELLO sketching.

BILLY stares over a precipice: he knows this as well.

CONTINUED: (3)

FRENCH comes in from the kitchen.

ON SOUND the door closes and locks.

COSTELLO leaves.

INT. COSTELLO'S KITCHEN. DAY/INTERCUT: INT. COLIN'S OFFICE

COSTELLO is on the phone. MISTER FRENCH is sitting on a

stool, smoking. OPERA playing on sound.

COSTELLO hangs up and turns to MISTER FRENCH.

CONTINUED:

Costello hangs up and turns to Mr. French.

INT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS. DAY

Everybody is busy in the office. It's COLIN's first day of

Internal Investigations. COLIN'S moving through the bullpen.

COPS stare at him with resentment.

He comes up to Queenan's door just as Dignam comes out.

DIGNAM faces COLIN down.

He walks away.

COLIN goes into Queenan's office.

INT. QUEENAN'S OFFICE. MOMENTS LATER

QUEENAN puts the cig into a cup of water, and throws it into

the trash.

COLIN sits uneasily.

CONTINUED:

COLIN realizes: Just follow Queenan and you'll find his rat.

INT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2. DAY

COLIN is sitting in his office alone, remembering what

Queenan has just told him:

In the fishbowl of his glass office, COLIN is being stared at

by pissed-off cops. COLIN calms down. He opens the gray

envelope. He takes out the forms that he was given by

Costello, opens up POLICE PERSONNEL DATABASE and starts

searching. He types in SS numbers. One, then another, then

another. The result is always: "Person not found". He types

in Costigan, William M, hits return. It comes up: "Person not

found". COLIN keeps working.

INT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2. LATER

MUGSHOTS of all of Costello's guys. He looks at them

desperately...no one squares up with the blurred, impossible,

images he saw on the CCTV screen (which he has printed

out).COLIN closes the curtains on his fishbowl office (not

fast enough to avoid seeing Dignam give him the finger),

locks his door. He picks up the phone.

INT. COLIN AND MADOLYN'S NEW BEDROOM.   SAME NIGHT

COLIN is lying in bed, his back to MADOLYN.

Another city doesn't seem unattractive to Madolyn, who's in

her own cut-and-run crisis -- but maybe she can't believe

that Colin is thinking about it. She blows a breath.

CONTINUED:

COLIN is in hell.    He looks at her intensely.

Long pause.

EXT. THE CHARLES STREET BRASSERIE. DAY

FITZY and DELAHUNT are smoking on the sidewalk outside the

restaurant.

THEIR POV:

A MAN across the street is looking into the window of an

antique shop.

A WOMAN walks by definitely ignoring both men, dragging a

lapdog.

No response.

CONTINUED:

INT. CHARLES STREET BRASSERIE. CONTINUOUS

Too early to be opened for business. COSTELLO and NEW GUYS,

six hard customers, come in through the fire door. At the

BAR, BILLY is drinking coffee. He notices the NEW GUYS. Off

the boat Dublin toughs. COSTELLO and FRENCH come in from the

kitchen. FRENCH tells the NEW GUYS to move to the back.

COSTELLO HAS BLOOD ON HIS SLEEVES. He comes over to the bar

and looks at BILLY.

COSTELLO heads to the back of the restaurant. MISTER FRENCH,

grabs the BAR KNIFE from behind the bar. BILLY looks up at

him.

MISTER FRENCH goes towards the back of the restaurant,

holding the big knife. BILLY closes his paper.

EXT. THE CHARLES STREET BRASSERIE. MOMENTS LATER

BILLY steps out, ignoring DELAHUNT and FITZY.

CONTINUED:

BILLY walks down the street and heads into an alley.   Around

the corner, he opens his phone.

EXT. POLICE STATION/COLIN'S OFFICE. DAY

A DETECTIVE (DETECTIVE 1) is leading the team to trail after

Queenan. On foot. A plug in his ear. Two other DETECTIVES sit

in a sedan nearby. (These three detectives are new guys,

never seen before, the I.I. surveillance team working for

Colin).

CONTINUED:

The detectives in the car get alert and start their car as

QUEENAN comes out of the building.

EXT. TREMONT STREET/FINANCIAL DISTRICT. DAY

DETECTIVE 1 trails Captain Queenan through the crowds of

people heading towards work.

INT. PARK ST. SUBWAY STATION. MORNING

QUEENAN begins to light a cigarette and then gives it up. A

TRAIN comes in, and Queenan boards. DETECTIVE 1 boards the

next car.

INT. DETECTIVE 1'S SUBWAY CAR. MOMENTS LATER

Looking through smeared glass into the next car as the train

begins to move DETECTIVE 1 sees QUEENAN answer a cell call.

INT. QUEENAN'S SUBWAY CAR. CONTINUOUS

QUEENAN is on his cell.

CONTINUED:

QUEENAN looks up mildly as the car rocks.

QUEENAN'S POV:

BILLY is slumped in a seat at the far end, not looking

towards QUEENAN.

Through the glass we see DETECTIVE 1 watching Queenan.

As the train stops BILLY vaults off of it. On the platform he

walks along, texting.

EXT. SOUTH STATION SUBWAY EXIT. LATE MORNING

QUEENAN, mild in his specs, chewing gum with his dentures,

comes out of the station, and looks at the TEXT MESSAGE on

his phone.

EXT. A STREET SOUTH OF FT. POINT CHANNEL. MOMENTS LATER

A building under rehab, covered with scaffolding, but still

functioning as a corporate building. QUEENAN goes along to

the entrance, and in.

DETECTIVE 1 comes along after him. We see the Internal

Investigations car up the street. DETECTIVE 1 dials his

cellphone.

INT. THE LOBBY. MOMENTS LATER

DETECTIVE 1 looks at the elevator-indicator, and the building

directory.

INT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2. CONTINUOUS

COLIN, listening, playing with a COIN.

EXT. COMMERCIAL BUILDING. MOMENTS LATER

DETECTIVE 1 emerges from the building and joins other

detectives in the car.

INT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2/BRASSERIE. CONTINUOUS

COLIN, after fumbling between cell phones, dials the correct

one.

EXT. CHARLES STREET BRASSERIE. MOMENTS LATER

FITZY and DELAHUNT'S phones ring simultaneously.

BILLY is waiting on the roof as QUEENAN finally arrives.

BILLY nods, and nods.

INT. FITZY'S VAN. CONTINUOUS

DELAHUNT is calling Billy from a van crowded with Costello's

usual bad guys as it scorches through traffic.

EXT. COMMERCIAL BUILDING ROOFTOP. CONTINUOUS

BILLY listens in horror, staring at the oblivious QUEENAN.

QUEENAN realizes that his enemy might be...

INT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2. CONTINUOUS

COLIN raises his eyes. Diabolical.

EXT. COMMERCIAL BUILDING. MOMENTS LATER

FITZY'S VAN stops outside the building. COSTELLO'S MEN get

out of the van, and head into the lobby.

INT. INTERNAL INVESTIGATIONS CAR. CONTINUOUS

The DETECTIVES are watching.

CONTINUED:

INT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2. CONTINUOUS

COLIN listens.

INT. STAIRCASE. DAY

Billy and Queenan are running downstairs when they hear

footsteps coming up from below. They immediately go back up

to the elevator lobby. Pushing through plastic sheeting.

INT. LOBBY ON THE TOP FLOOR. CONTINUOUS

Billy is slamming elevator buttons. The indicator shows both

elevators coming up.

BILLY goes. Queenan waits. Watching the elevator indicator.

QUEENAN, in his specs, very mild, takes out his gun and

breaks the cylinder, checking that it is loaded, and putting

a shell into the empty sixth chamber.

EXT. FIRE ESCAPE. MOMENTS LATER

BILLY climbs out onto the fire escape at the back of the

building and starts dropping down, fast.

INT. THE TOP FLOOR LOBBY. DAY

The elevator door opens, revealing DELAHUNT and BOYS. QUEENAN

looks right as the door to the staircase opens revealing

FITZY and boys.

QUEENAN doesn't answer, and never will. He draws his gun and

is tackled.

EXT. BACK ALLEY, COMMERCIAL BUILDING. DAY

BILLY drops off the fire escape and runs down the alley.

EXT. COMMERCIAL BUILDING. MOMENTS LATER

BILLY towards the front doors just as--

QUEENAN'S BODY bounces off the scaffolding, smashes into the

pavement and explodes. BLOOD splashes all over BILLY.

INT. INTERNAL INVESTIGATIONS CAR. CONTINUOUS

DETECTIVE 1 screams into his headset.

EXT. THE COMMERCIAL BUILDING. CONTINUOUS

FITZY, DELAHUNT and boys come out. The crew has seen the

UNMARKED COP CAR. FITZY grabs BILLY.

CONTINUED:

They start piling into a van.

INT. THE INTERNAL INVESTIGATIONS CAR. CONTINUOUS

DETECTIVE 2 is yelling both at his partner and into the mic.

INT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2. CONTINUOUS

COLIN is sitting very calmly.

INT./EXT. INTERNAL INVESTIGATIONS CAR/ THE STREET. CONTINUOUS

DETECTIVE 1 gets out of the car and runs towards the fleeing

men, gun drawn.

FITZY turns on DETECTIVE 1 with a pistol drawn. DETECTIVE 1

fires and DELAHUNT is hit in the stomach. FITZY shoots the

detective (he is wounded in the hand, not killed). The VAN

takes off.

INT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2. CONTINUOUS

ON RADIO. "Officer down", etc. COLIN has never felt more

guilty in his life.

He switches off the light and sits in the dark as the

afternoon gathers.

INT. THE DEAD BAR. NIGHT

FITZY, BILLY, and the BOYS are drinking. Dirty, paranoid,

guilty, frightened, smoking. DELAHUNT has been shot, is

dying, on a dirty couch.

FITZY sits down and looks at Billy.

FITZY walks away.

CONTINUED:

BILLY realizes that DELAHUNT is dying.

BILLY lights him a cigarette.

DELAHUNT grips his arm. BILLY is terrified.

CONTINUED: (2)

He waits for DELAHUNT to continue. But DELAHUNT after an odd

smile of complicity, finally dies. BILLY, the only one who

knows that DELAHUNT is dead, stares down at him.

BILLY walks past the table.

BILLY leaves by the front door.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM. NIGHT

All hands present. Dignam is in a black silent rage.

DIGNAM grabs COLIN by the neck and runs him into a wall.

COLIN gets a palm under Dignam's chin and comes close to

breaking his neck. The men at length are separated. COLIN

straightens his good clothes.

CONTINUED:

COLIN is trying this on.

DIGNAM hits COLIN in the face. COLIN goes down hard, into the

crook of a file cabinet and the wall. Blood from his mouth.

CONTINUED: (2)

EXT. MADOLYN'S OFFICE BUILDING. NIGHT

When she comes out: BILLY is waiting.

He leans close to her.    She strokes his head.

MADOLYN walks away.

INTERCUT COLIN'S OFFICE #2/COSTELLO'S CONDOMINIUM. NIGHT

COLIN needs a shower and is gun-shy as people move past the

glass windows. He is still rinsing blood out of his mouth.

COSTELLO is listening to LUCIA di LAMMAMOOR. GWEN sits nearby

in attractive lingerie, reading a book.

CONTINUED:

COSTELLO turns to the GWEN.

He starts to dial the phone.

CONTINUED: (2)

She rises and as she crosses:

COLIN looks out into the bullpen. People working. On a table

he sees PLASTIC BAGS which contains Queenan's bloodstained

effects-- broken glasses, smashed wristwatch, and CELLPHONE.

He glances around, and picks up the CELLPHONE. Blood gets on

his fingers. He moves into the office, and seen through the

glass, he seizes the phone and with trembling fingers punches

up the last incoming number.

INT. BILLY'S MOTHER'S APARTMENT KITCHEN. NIGHT

BILLY is looking at a chipped SANTA MUG from his childhood

and is eating something--sheer maintenance, and drinking wine

from the bottle. His phone rings. He looks at the ID and is

stunned. Queenan's number! He picks up the call but remains

silent. The caller is also doing the same.

INT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2. CONTINUOUS

COLIN hears that the other side has hung up the phone. He

sees: ELLERBY looking at him through the glass. But Ellerby

hasn't seen the phone.

INTERCUT BILLY'S MOTHER'S APARTMENT/COLIN'S OFFICE #2.

CONTINUOUS

BILLY is agitated. Exhausted. Frightened. He paces, and looks

at the phone. He begins to pack, assembling clothes, money.

Finally, like a man committing suicide--it's that intense--

he dials the number. INTERCUT.

CONTINUED:

BILLY listens to Colin go on. Then shuts off the phone. His

other phone rings.

COLIN dumps out the box of Queenan's belongings. In the

diary he sees an entry showing undercover suspects Costello

is FBI informant.

BILLY listens to Colin go on. Then shuts off the phone. His

other phone rings.

INT. THE CHARLES STREET BRASSERIE. DAY

COSTELLO is sitting with his key guys, including FRENCH and

FITZY. A TV station plays above the zinc bar. BILLY is

drinking, hitting it heavily.

The TV shows DELAHUNT'S BODY being loaded into an ambulance.

A crime scene. COSTELLO's eyes have widened slightly. But he

is strangely undisturbed.

CONTINUED:

He makes a move for the door.

They get up to leave, following him.

EXT. SOUTHEAST EXPRESSWAY. NIGHT

Two cars carrying Costello and his men are speeding down the

highway. Behind them, two SIU CARS are trailing.

INT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2/COSTELLO'S CAR. CONTINUOUS

COLIN closes his door and punches in a number.

IN COSTELLO'S CAR, his cell phone rings.

He answers it.

CONTINUED:

CLOSE on COLIN as what he has to do crystallizes.

A cold look in his eye, Colin leaves his office and goes down

the hall.

IN THE CAR

Costello remarks to French --

INT. SURVEILLANCE OFFICE. MOMENTS LATER

BROWN is there. BARRIGAN. ELLERBY. Others.

COLIN stands in the door like a gunfighter. Everyone looks at

him.

CONTINUED:

Everyone is impressed.

Everyone moves at once.

EXT. SOUTHEAST EXPRESSWAY. NIGHT

COSTELLO is checking the rearview mirror. He sees: The TWO

SIU CARS exit the highway onto Atlantic Avenue. COSTELLO

smiles.

The cars exit the highway. The cars pass through a maze of

industrial streets.

CONTINUED:

BILLY, riding in the back seat, is trying desperately to see

where they are. He sees a STREET SIGN and taps out a text

message on his phone.

INT. COMMAND VAN. NIGHT (MOVING)

COLIN, in vest, observed by Brown, reads the message.

EXT. PARKING GARAGE. NIGHT

It is an unfinished structure, the lower parts used, the

upper parts accessible but still under construction. It is

built on a pier, the harbor lights beyond it. The COMMAND VAN

and POLICE CARS pull up with lights off. A TACTICAL VAN

disgorges TACTICAL OFFICERS who spread out through the dark.

INT. COMMAND VAN. CONTINUOUS.

COLIN checks the load on his pistol.

INT. AN UPPER FLOOR OF THE PARKING GARAGE. CONTINUOUS

COSTELLO unlocks a CONTAINER with a construction company logo

on it, opens the doors, and steps back. BILLY looks into the

container. It's cocaine or heroin in kilo bricks. Men stand

around with MP5s under their coats.

BILLY, trying to save Costello...

COSTELLO looks at him.

CONTINUED:

The drugs having been loaded fast by the crew, including

FNG's, the container is hosed out. BILLY turns from FITZY'S

CAR as everyone gets it.

Instead of getting into COSTELLO'S CAR on the other side of

the container, he steps back into shadows as both cars leave.

INT. COSTELLO'S CAR. NIGHT

FOUR CARS with no headlights bracket the vehicles as soon as

they come out of the garage. COSTELLO realizes that something

has gone wrong.

LIGHTS come on, and Policemen are everywhere, guns in their

hands. COLIN is not visible among them.

POLICE open fire at Costello's car. THE CAR reverses back

into the garage. MISTER FRENCH (the driver) is shot in the

arm, and the car crashes into a wall. A gunfight opens up.

FNG's exchange fire with brutally efficient tactical cops and

are shot down expertly. COSTELLO, limping, gets out of the

action, fast. He runs into the parking garage. French drives

away (alternately is shot, or commits suicide).

INT. PARKING GARAGE. NIGHT

COSTELLO, shot through the stomach, is moving through the

dark. All that's stored in this garage is heavy equipment for

the big dig. Plenty of places to hide. We hear gunfire in the

distance. COSTELLO hides between two pieces of heavy

equipment and dials his telephone. To his surprise the phone

rings quite nearby. And keeps ringing.

CONTINUED:

COSTELLO moves out into the open, and sees, at a near

distance, COLIN, his shadow long on the concrete. He has a

gun in his hand. Costello moves out to face him.

COSTELLO comes out of the shadows.

COSTELLO says nothing for a moment.

COLIN instantly raises the pistol to shoot him.

COLIN'S PISTOL wavers.

COLIN shakes his head and cocks the gun.

COSTELLO tries to raise his gun which is inside his sleeve.

He's sitting on his coat so that the shot goes off sideways

as COLIN shoots him.

CONTINUED: (2)

COSTELLO topples backward into the bucket of the bucket

loader.

ANGLE ON COLIN.

Then from the bucket loader, a post death tremor sets off one

last shot from COSTELLO'S gun. Ricochet. COLIN fires into the

dead body again and again. He backs away.

INT. POLICE HQ/CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

Colin is debriefed concerning the shooting of Costello.

[Dialog separate document].

INT. BULLPEN AREA. DAY

COLIN enters, tired from a debriefing. Applause from everyone

in the office--the full crew. COLIN is embarrassed by the

attention. BROWN is leading the whole team to a standing

ovation. COLIN looks past the heads of the crowd and sees:

Dignam, staring at him evenly.

QUEENAN'S SECRETARY brings him some wine.

He takes a glass of wine. Then guiltily, almost in tears, he

drinks. BROWN jerks a thumb towards Colin's office #2.

CONTINUED:

COLIN goes off.

INT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2. NIGHT

In Colin's office BILLY sits with his ankle on his knee. He

looks very tired, dirty. Wearing a VISITOR badge.

COLIN takes it.

CONTINUED:

He writes it.    Colin takes the paper and hides his

astonishment.

Billy nods.    He goes.

INT. COMPUTER ROOM. NIGHT

COLIN accesses the personal database, enters the password.

Billy's confidential file opens up. Every fact about the man.

Photos.

INT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2. CONTINUOUS

Billy takes a drink from the bottle COLIN has put on the

desk. As he puts the bottle down he sees, sticking out of a

box, a BROWN ENVELOPE. On it is written "CITIZENS." BILLY

picks up the envelope...and knows everything.

INT. COMPUTER ROOM. CONTINUOUS

COLIN is reviewing it Billy's file. Outside the glass wall we

see BILLY, staring at COLIN's back...and then moving on.

INT. COLIN'S OFFICE #2. LATER

COLIN enters, holding a printout of Billy's personnel file.

He looks around the empty room. He sees the BROWN ENVELOPE

lying on the desk, and understands everything. He sits down

at his own computer--which does in fact work, and opens the

personnel file.

COLIN clicks DELETE. "Do You Really Want to Delete?" COLIN

clicks "Yes" and Billy's picture, file, life, disappear.

EXT. POLICE BUILDING. NIGHT

BILLY exits the police building and moves across the plaza.

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE MADOLYN'S OFFICE - DAY

BILLY waits outside Madolyn's office.

MADOLYN, carrying work, breakfast, rounds the corner and sees

him standing and waiting for her. She's a little spooked,

opens her mouth to speak...

CONTINUED:

He gives her a manila envelope.

Madolyn is a friend. She's not going to ask questions.           She

accepts the envelope.

He backs away, and then turns to go.

He turns and looks at her.          She doesn't speak: can't.

She moves her head slightly, watches him go.

INT. MADOLYN'S OFFICE. MOMENTS LATER.

MADOLYN sits at her desk, devastated, looking at a fall of

light. The envelope lies on her blotter. She sits on ...

then straightens up, takes a marker and writes "COSTIGAN" on

the envelope and puts it in her desk drawer.

CONTINUED:

We DISSOLVE to a SONOGRAM.

INT. COLIN'S APARTMENT. MORNING

A SONOGRAM picture of a fetus. It looks to him at first like

a CCTV picture blown up. COLIN stares as if at something in a

horror film.

Referring to the envelope

He does.

Colin belatedly thinks of what a human being might do in

these circumstances and kisses her.

CONTINUED:

INT COLIN'S APARTMENT - LATER

COLIN is in the shower. MADOLYN moves into the     kitchen and

puts the kettle on. She checks the mail, lying     there on the

counter. It's tied with a string. She undoes       the string and

sorts through the mail. Suddenly, she freezes      looking at:

AN OVERSIZED ENVELOPE addressed to COLIN: [COLIN SULLIVAN, 20

Pickering Street, Apt TK, Boston, MA, zip TK], with a return

address of Wm. Costigan, 13 Conant St., Boston, etc., etc.]

MADOLYN stares at the envelope, listening to the shower

going. Billy has written to her fiance. She starts to put

the envelope down, and then realizes...she has to hide

it...she has to open it.

Inside the envelope is a jewel case: EXILE ON MAIN STREET.

And a note: PLAY ME NOW. MADOLYN puts the CD into the

machine. She puts on the headset and listens...and listens.

COLIN comes out of the bathroom, dressed in jeans and t-

shirt, barefoot, his hair wet. He looks at Madolyn,

realizing that something is wrong.

MADOLYN pulls the headphone jack out of the stereo and

roughly the following booms out of the speakers. [NOTE: THIS

RECORDING WAS DONE IN POST -- I THINK FROM THE PORN THEATRE

DIALOGUE.]

COLIN stares at her and we ought to think murder is a

possibility.

CONTINUED: (2)

COLIN and MADOLYN stare at each other.

She goes into the bedroom. COLIN'S PHONE RINGS. He answers

it.

EXT. COMMERCIAL BUILDING ROOFTOP. DAY

BILLY is walking, on the phone, happy, and twisting the

knife.

INT. MADOLYN AND COLIN'S APARMENT. CONTINUOUS

COLIN closes a door to speak privately.

CONTINUED:

COLIN goes to the bedroom door and tries it. Locked. He

knocks. No answer.

It's over. He starts to punch the door, and then does not.

EXT. COMMERCIAL BUILDING. DAY

COLIN comes along and walks into the lobby. He is not looking

for a tail...

EXT. COMMERCIAL BUILDING ROOFTOP. DAY

COLIN looks out through the door, no gun drawn, but very much

a cop clearing his corners. He steps out and--BILLY takes him

from behind the door, his only blind side, and grabs the back

of his collar and crams a pistol into the bottom of his

skull.

BILLY turns Colin around and puts the pistol to Colin's

forehead, hard enough to break the skin. He takes out Colin's

belt gun and puts it in his pocket. (Billy screams "hands!"

at Colin every time he makes a move).

CONTINUED:

BILLY cracks him across the jaw with the gun. COLIN goes

down. COLIN is drooling blood, his bell rung, one eye open.

Billy throws away Colin's ankle gun.

BILLY puts the gun to Colin's head.

CONTINUED: (2)

COLIN is hammered to his knees. Head down, blood in his

hair, drooling blood, thinking (impossibly) about his next

move. He seems to realize he's fucked.

BILLY grabs the back of Colin's collar and puts the gun to

Colin's head. A crunch of gravel, off. BILLY and COLIN both

hear it.

BILLY drags COLIN to his feet and using Colin as a shield

aims the pistol at: BROWN. Brown is aiming his weapon.

CONTINUED: (3)

Billy realizes he's in a truly shitty situation:   appearances

are everything.

BROWN, weapon ready, follows into the elevator lobby.

INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY/ELEVATOR. DAY

BILLY moves COLIN into the elevator and as the doors close

looks back at BROWN, still in a Mexican stand-off.

COLIN, nose broken, blood masking his face.

CONTINUED:

The indicator ticks. Down, down, down. Colin sobs.

The doors open and for a frozen moment BILLY, holding the gun

on COLIN, stares out of the car. A LOUD BANG. BILLY is shot

through the head. BLOOD sprays the walls, and COLIN is hit by

flying blood and matter. BILLY falls, crumpled, on his face,

half in and half out of the elevator. The doors try to

close...open...COLIN, covered with blood, looks up.

BARRIGAN lowers his pistol.

COLIN slumps, covered with blood. BARRIGAN uncuffs him. COLIN

feels his wrists. BARRIGAN picks up BILLY'S gun. The other

elevator doors open and BROWN emerges. He looks into the

bloody elevator and down at the dead man.

BARRIGAN raises BILLY'S GUN and shoots BROWN in the head.

COLIN stares at him.

BARRIGAN casually hands COLIN BILLY'S GUN. COLIN presses the

gun against BARRIGAN's forehead and fires.

EXT. THE COMMERCIAL BUILDING. DAY

POLICE TAPE, plenty of cars. Three corpses being loaded onto

ambulances. COLIN, hands free, is drinking coffee from a

paper cup, being checked out by a doctor.

INT. POLICE HQ/CONFERENCE ROOM - NOT MUCH LATER

CONTINUED:

COLIN has been cleaned up a little by paramedics. He's maybe

had his lip stitched, but he's still wearing his bloody

clothes.

COLIN looks up, eyes clear, perfectly believable.   As we

transition to the FUNERAL...bagpipes coming up.

ON SOUND

BAGPIPES (Something like"Cross of Fire") as we DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. CEMETERY. DAY

BILLY'S GRAVESITE. The same cemetery as his mother is buried

in. UNIFORMED POLICEMEN (not only State, but MDC, the way

they do it, for "brother officers"), saluting.

MADOLYN is at the gravesite, dry-eyed though in, distinctly

apart from COLIN. He looks at her. She looks away from him,

apparently forever.

CONTINUED:

COLIN squares off: his job in the world is to get ahead. A

salute is fired with rifles. But later...

COLIN and MADOLYN are walking through the graves.

She moves away from him without answering. MADOLYN walks out

through the cemetery gates. COLIN hesitates.

INT. THE STAIRWAY OF COLIN'S APARTMENT. EVENING

COLIN has a bag of expensive groceries and wine. Living the

Beacon Hill dream. He climbs the steps slowly. He nods to a

neighbor, an old lady coming down with her dog (who

incidentally will never accept him as a neighbor, and COLIN

briefly seems aware of this). (Don't be afraid to get a bit

French here). He gets to his door, and starts to cry, and

nearly crumples. But he gets the door open. He looks up and

sees a gun. Behind it, stepping fast out of the shadows,

DIGNAM. Avenging a guy he didn't even like, because it's the

right thing to do. COLIN looks down and sees that Dignam has

plastic hospital boots on his feet.

DIGNAM fires. Flash groceries fall all over the floor.

DIGNAM'S FEET step over COLIN's body, crushing one of a half

dozen croissants, and DIGNAM goes down the expensive

staircase, leaving the door to the apartment open. The

strangest thing happens: a rat emerges and begins to eat the

dead man's croissants. The rat hears something and runs so

it's not in the shot when it

FREEZES.
