The Dad grabs Clay, pulls him off of Laser and over the

couch. He gets his son in a headlock, forcing the boy's face

into his big fat sweaty armpit. Both Dad and Clay enjoy the

brutal play. Clay laughs manically.

As Laser observes this male-bonding between father and son,

we note a trace of longing on his face.

INT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - DINING ROOM

Joni, Laser and JULES ALLGOOD (40's) fair-skinned,

attractive, sit before well prepared dinner. Still buzzing,

Laser taps his fingers incessantly on the table.

EXT. HOUSE - ESTABLISHING - MAGIC HOUR

NIC ALLGOOD (late 40's) pulls up into the driveway beside a

beat up white TRUCK covered in AA slogan bumper stickers.

INT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - DINING ROOM - EVENING

Nic enters.   Drops her bag and heads for the table.

Nic takes another swig of vino and smiles at Joni through

increasingly plum-stained teeth.

Joni mimes wiping her teeth.   Embarrassed, Nic starts licking

at her stained teeth.

INT. JONI'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

As Joni cranks out thank-you notes, Laser enters.

Laser looks nervous.

He starts to leave, but her answer bugs him.    He turns back.

Laser walks out of the room.   Joni feels horrible.

INT. NIC AND JULES BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT

Nic and Jules lay in bed watching TV, unwinding from the day.

ANGLE ON - THE TV

The volume is turned low on TWO NAKED MEN lying on a chaise

longue. One guy fellating the other.

INT. STAIRCASE - SAME

Joni tiptoes up a dark staircase and enters an office off the

mom's bedroom. She heads for the desk and stealthy opens a

drawer. She rummages though with clear intention.

She pulls out a FOLDER and studies the cover. We see the

words: "Pacific Cryo Clinic: Bringing your dreams to life."

INT. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

ANGLE ON - THE BED

We now only see Nic. Jules has slipped under the blanket,

and is now between Nic's legs. We see Nic trying to get into

it, but having a hard time.

Jules wrestles with the blankets.    Wants them out of her way.

Jules wrangles the blankets, trying to cover her partner.

The transition is awkward and Jules gets caught in the top

sheet. As Nic repositions herself, she leans on the VOLUME

CONTROL BUTTON and suddenly the porn is blasting at full

volume.

Jules and Nic both dive for the remote. It's lost under the

mass of bedding. They struggle to find it as the grunting

and 70's disco music blares.

INT. OFFICE - JONI

Joni turns to the wall, confused.    She hears the porno music

pulsing though.

INT. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Nic finally recovers the remote and hits mute.

Nic flops back, traumatized.

Jules looks defeated.

INT. OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Joni turns back to the file on the desk. She flips though

some pages of documents and stops. CLOSE ON a PHOTO of a 4

YEAR-OLD BOY standing in a sandbox looking straight into a

camera with a big, open grin.

EXT. FARM - DAY

We see that boy, 35 years later, carrying a box of tomatoes

and putting them in the back of a truck. This is PAUL, Joni

and Laser's biological father.

INT. PAUL'S RESTAURANT - "WYSIWYG"    - DAY

Paul walks in carrying the box of tomatoes. He approaches

TANYA, (30's) the restaurant's super sexy hostess.

They stand close to each other, peering at the chart.

Paul's cell rings. He gives Tanya a hand squeeze and heads

for the kitchen, answering.

At the mention of the word sperm, Paul goes pale.

INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Paul enters. The kitchen is humming with COOKS prepping for

the dinner rush. He looks around for a quiet spot.

A cook, MARGO, approaches Paul to speak with him.   Paul nods:

"Can't talk." Hands her the box of tomatoes.

Paul heads to the back of the kitchen, searching for privacy.

INT. PANTRY - SAME

Paul moves into the pantry, finds the farthest corner.

Paul's speechless.

Paul and Tanya enjoy a hot, sweaty fuck.

LATER THAT NIGHT

Paul gets dressed while Tanya lays on her messy bed.

Tanya moves closer to him, flirty.

INT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - DINING ROOM

Joni and Jules play scrabble at the table. Joni's cell

rings. She grabs it off the counter and answers.

EXT. PAUL'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY

Paul anxiously paces his overgrown back-yard on his cell

phone. He picks weeds as he talks. Conversation intercut.

Paul cringes at his lameness.     Joni doesn't know what to say.

OMITTED.

EXT. "WYSIWYG", PARKING LOT - NEXT DAY

Joni and Laser get out of the car and head to the restaurant

to meet Paul. They're both clearly nervous.

INT. "WYSIWYG" - DAY

Paul sits alone at a table facing the entrance.   He nervously

checks the door as customers enter.

MINUTES LATER-

Joni and Laser enter the restaurant.   They look nervous too.

ANGLE ON PAUL

He studies them for a beat, sees them looking around.

Figures they must be "his kids." They look in his direction,

spot him. He raises his hand, stands. They walk over.

The moment is rife.    Paul holds out his hand to Joni.

Paul holds out a hand to Laser.

No one knows what comes next.

Paul turns and leads them out to the outdoor dining area.

EXT. OUTDOOR DINING AREA - MINUTES LATER

They all sit eating.    Paul can't help but study their faces.

Paul presses on, trying to break the ice.

Excited, Joni turns to Laser.    He seems uninterested.

EXT. WYSIWYG, PARKING LOT - DAY

The kids and Paul exit the restaurant. Paul walks to a

classic BMW motorcycle. Lasers tries to hide his awe.

Time to say goodbye. Again, no one knows the protocol here.

After an awkward beat, Paul holds out his arms for hugs.

He and Joni hug.

Now Paul and Laser share a somewhat awkward man-hug.

Joni gives a quick wave to Paul. She turns to go and Laser

follows. Paul watches them walk away. He looks stirred up

by the meeting.

INT. JONI'S CAR - DAY

Joni and Laser head back home.

OMITTED

INT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - TV ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

Nic and Jules are cuddled up affectionately on the couch

watching cable. They see Laser on his way out of the house.

Laser leaves.   Nic hits mute on the TV, looks at Jules.

Nic clicks the volume back on, freezing Jules out.

INT.   PAUL'S RESTAURANT - AFTERNOON

Paul and Tanya sit at the bar, eating family-meal.

Brooke, the sexy Wiccan volunteer, comes up to Paul bearing a

basket of freshly-picked fruits.

Paul leans over the basket.

And with that, she smiles, hands him the basket and leaves.

Paul can't help smiling at the nasty talk.

INT. NIC AND JULES BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

Clay rummages through the top drawer of Jules' dresser.

Laser stands behind him, uncomfortable.

Clay freezes. CLOSE ON a row of sex toys including a fancy

pink, Japanese "all-in-one" dildo and a few DVD's.

Clay turns on the dildo.      It starts to gyrate.

Laughing, Clay throws the dildo back in the drawer.    Then he

grabs one of the DVDs and spins back around.

INT. LASER'S ROOM - DAY

Laser and Clay sit on the bed.     They look at each other.

Then Laser hits play.

ON SCREEN

We see a COP giving a young MAN a BLOW-JOB. Laser and Clay

sit motionless, shocked, disgusted, riveted.

Clay doesn't answer.    They just keep watching.

OMITTED

OMITTED

EXT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY

Jules pulls her truck into the driveway, almost running over

Laser's bike.

INT. LASER'S ROOM - DAY

Laser and Clay are still watching the porn...as Jules walks

in the room.

Laser reflexively grabs for the remote. As he fumbles for

it, Jules sees what they're watching. She looks mortified.

INT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - KITCHEN - THAT EVENING

We enter a family conference already in progress.

Nic and Jules act calm but are inwardly mortified that their

15-year-old son found their porn.

Laser looks confused.   How did they find out about Paul?

Nic and Jules share a worried look.

Jules and Nic go white.

INT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

Joni has been pulled into the family conference. Nic and

Jules are trying to remain as calm as possible. Nic slugs a

gulp of wine.

Jules calms her riled-up partner.

You do?!                         You do?!

Joni looks at Laser.   They knew this would happen.

INT. NIC AND JULES' BATHROOM - NIGHT

Nic and Jules do a post-mortem as they floss.

When Jules leaves the room Nic pulls a clump of long, wet red

hair out of the sink.

Nic throws the clump of hair in the trash.

INT. NIC AND JULES BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Nic smiles.   She loves when Jules shows confidence.

The women bump fists.   They have a plan.

EXT. STREET - AFTERNOON

Paul rides slowly down the street, checking addresses. He

pulls over and cuts his engine in front of the Allgood house.

OMITTED

INT/EXT. ALLGOOD FRONT DOOR - AFTERNOON

Paul rings the bell. Waits. The door opens and Nic and

Jules are there smiling with "kill him with kindness" faces.

Paul shakes their hands.

Nic clocks the motorcycle, stifles the impulse to judge.

As they enter, Paul holds out a bottle of wine.

Nic takes it.

Nic leaves Paul by the stairs with Jules. Little silence.

Jules steals a look at him, unable to contain her curiosity.

Paul nods, smiling at her nervousness.

Laser and Joni enter. Joni lights up when she sees Paul.

Jules watches Paul hug her. Uncomfortable, she heads for

THE KITCHEN --

Jules finds Nic's pouring herself a sizable glass of wine.

Jules feels her inner co-dependent swelling in her chest.

EXT. ALLGOOD PORCH - AFTERNOON

Everyone sits at the picnic table.

Jules smiles at Nic: "Isn't this great?   My first client."

Nic looks less than pleased.

OMITTED.

INT. HARDWARE STORE - DAY

Nic pushes a cart piled high with gardening supplies. Jules

grabs a couple BAGS of fertilizer, throws them on top.

The two separate, go down separate isles.     When they rejoin,

Nic is contrite.

Jules grabs the olive branch.

They both laugh.    Nic's funny sometimes.

EXT. PAUL'S HOUSE - ECHO PARK - DAY

Jules drives slowly up the hill looking for Paul's address.

She sees the house and pulls in the driveway next to an old

truck and a motorcycle.

EXT. PAUL'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY

Jules and Paul walk through Paul's backyard, evaluating.

Jules is staring at Paul.

Jules looks more intensely at Paul's face.

The observation strikes Paul. Suddenly, he's feeling a kind

of fast-tracked intimacy with Jules he hadn't expected.

EXT. BACKYARD - ALLGOOD HOUSE - EVENING

Jules and Laser play Ping-Pong as Nic gets home with Chinese

take-out for the family dinner.

Laser cranks a forehand that whizzes past Jules.

Laser serves a rocket, whizzing past a flailing Jules. He

tosses the racquet on the table and leaves. Nic yells:

EXT. ALLEY - DAY

We cut onto Paul and Laser, looking out at something.   Laser

is holding a DIGITAL VIDEO CAMERA.

We cut to Clay on a skateboard on the ledge of a brick wall.

He's preparing to ride the ledge, jump a dumpster and land

his board on the ground.

Laser sighs, then holds up the camera. Paul looks at Laser,

wondering why he puts up with this guy.

VIDEO CAMERA'S POV: We watch as Clay psychs himself up   with

an assortment of deep breaths and head-slaps. Finally,   he

starts down the ledge. He starts his jump, catches air   and

hits the edge of the dumpster and falls. We see him go   into

the dumpster and land with a nauseating THUD. Paul and   Laser

rush up and look over the edge.

There's Clay, his arm bent at a disturbing angle, in agony.

EXT. STREET OUTSIDE CLAY'S HOUSE - LATER

Paul and Laser walk over to Paul's truck.

Laser doesn't quite buy Paul's altruism.    He looks over at

him, then away.

INT. JONI'S ROOM - DAY

Jai and Joni and Sasha play Scrabble.    Sasha checks out the

photos of Paul on Joni's phone.

Sasha hops up, energized by the banter.

Sasha splits and suddenly the room is thick with nervous

tension.

As Jai incorporates Sasha's tiles into his own, we see Joni

gathering her nerve to make a move. Jai probably feels it

but in his nervousness he can't look at Joni.

Joni starts to move in, her face draws closer to Jai's, inch

by inch.

Somehow, deep down, Jai can sense her moving towards him

which exhilarates and freaks the shit out of him at the same

time. To the point where he lets slip...

That stops Joni in her tracks.

Jai's sabotaged the mood and they both know it.

INT. NIC AND JULES' BATHROOM - NIGHT

Jules walks in to find Nic in sexy satin man-PJ's, sitting at

the rim of a RUNNING BATH. There are candles burning.

Nic gets up and sashays to the door.

Nic exits.    Jules sinks back, wishing Nic had stayed.

CUT TO JULES - MINUTES LATER

Still waiting.    Getting impatient and upset.

No response.

CUT TO THE KITCHEN --

Nic is on her cell with a patient, a glass of wine in her

hand. Jules walks in wearing a bathrobe. Nic turns. Raises

a finger and mouths: "Sorry..."

Jules' face drops; she turns and leaves.

OMITTED.

INT./EXT.    PAUL'S HOUSE - DAY

Paul watches Jules work in his backyard.    Luis hauls shrubs.

INT. PAUL'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER

Paul and Jules stand at the kitchen table, looking over her

sketch for the yard.

Jules looks over at a pan on the kitchen counter.

Jules grabs the pie and gives him a kiss on the mouth, almost

as a mistake. Before they know it, they're making out.

Jules snaps back, freaked.

Jules starts backing away, acting as if nothing happened.

Jules bolts for the door, clutching her pie.   Paul watches

her go, stunned by what just happened.

INT. NIC AND JULES BEDROOM - NIGHT

Nic's in bed reading a magazine. Jules gets in bed,

paranoid. Nic puts her magazine down.

Chastened, Nic looks back at her magazine.    Jules rolls over.

EXT. URBAN FARM - ECHO PARK - DAY - MOS

Sweating and dirty, Joni and Paul pull radishes from the

ground. They're in a zone together. Paul takes off his sun-

hat and put it on Joni's head.

Joni's cell rings.    She looks.   Rolls her eyes.

Joni hits the ignore button, puts her cell away.

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MAGIC HOUR

Laser walks with Clay. Clay sports a homemade arm-cast for

the skateboard mishap we witnessed earlier.

Laser doesn't know how to respond so he ignores the comment.

A stray DOG comes up to them. Laser stops to pet it.

EXT. URBAN FARM PARKING LOT - ECHO PARK - MAGIC HOUR

Paul and Joni walk to his motorcycle parked in the dirt lot

behind them. Paul grabs his helmet off the bike, hands it to

Joni.

hill.

EXT. ECHO PARK TO THE WEST SIDE - MAGIC HOUR

Paul takes Joni home on his motorcycle via Sunset Boulevard.

She holds Paul tightly.

Joni closes the door on her.

INT. PAUL'S HOUSE - DAY

From his house, Paul watches Jules working on her knees in

the garden.

CLOSE ON Jules' thong peaking out of her jeans. Luis walks

across Paul's field of vision, interrupting his reverie.

INT. PAUL'S HOUSE - LATER

Jules steps tentatively into Paul's house.

Overcome with lust, Jules wraps her legs around his waist and

Paul walks her into...

HIS BEDROOM

Quick cuts of their awkward ravenous gropings. Somewhere

between slapstick and animal. He pulls her hair back hard.

She loves it. She pulls his hair back harder. He yelps.

She pulls down his underwear. Her eyes widen. It's been

decades since she's seen a hard cock in the flesh.

Cut to them fucking. It's gawky and passionate.    Somewhere

in the middle of it, Jules starts laughing.

Paul flips her on her hands and knees and they go at it some

more.

She keeps laughing. Paul goes harder to make her stop. The

paces grows quicker. They're getting closer. And then...

They stop mid-thrust.

She dislodges from Paul and starts dressing furiously.

INT./EXT.   PAUL'S HOUSE - DAY

Jules runs out to meet Luis, waiting patiently at the door.

Luis stares at his employer. She looks totally disheveled.

Jules starts feeling her hair, smoothing it into shape.

Luis stares at her feet.       She looks down.   She's barefoot.

EXT. PUBLIC PARK - DAY

Paul and Laser shoot hoop. There's a tense-ness to their

patter. Laser takes the ball and steps to the top of the key

and shoots. Drains it.

Laser steps up to left side of the basket, calls his shot.

Laser does a trick behind the back lay-up.        Nails it.   Then

tosses the ball to Paul.

Nic storms off.   Jules turns to Joel and Stella, ashen.

INT. RESTAURANT BAR - MINUTES LATER

Jules walks over to the bar. Nic is sitting in the corner.

Jules tries to bring it down.   She yells in hushed tones.

JULES AND PAUL

Fucking again in his bedroom. Jules writhes beneath him, her

eyes closed.   Paul seems to be in some kind of zone. He

stares at her, enthralled.

POST - COITUS

Jules and Paul lie naked in the bed. Jules slithers around

the covers, stoned on post-coital endorphins.

Jules pops up on her knees, getting in his face.

Jules punches his arm, mock hurt. They start rough-housing.

Then kissing. Then the phone rings.

Paul grabs a handful of Jules' ass. Jules throws her leg

over Paul and climbs up for another round. Suddenly, Joni's

voice echoes through the machine.

Paul grabs the receiver.

Jules visibly recoils.

Jules pales. She mouths: "What are you doing?!"    Paul

gesticulates: "I'm sorry!"

Jules throws on her clothes and starts to leave.

Paul grabs Jules' wrist and mouths "wait!"   Jules rips her

arm free and walks out.

MOMENTS LATER - JULES

walks outside and is stunned to find Luis already back from

Home Depot, sneezing and wiping his nose.

INT. NIC AND JULES BEDROOM - NIGHT

Jules lies on her side. Nic shuffles to get to close to her.

Jules moves away, still pissed at her. Nic realizes she

needs to make amends.

INT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - KITCHEN - NEXT MORNING

The family sits in silence, having breakfast.     Nic looks

around the table, feeling like a pariah.

Everyone keeps eating, uncommitted.   "And...?"

Nic looks at Jules and smiles. Everyone nods.     They

recognize this is a big step for Nic.

OMITTED

EXT. PAUL'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY

Paul walks out to check on Jules. She's sweating her ass

off, shlepping stacks of heavy mulch across the yard.

Paul takes some of her load and together they transport the

sod to the other side of the yard. Neither know what to say.

Paul stares at her, waiting for her lead.

They stare at each other and we cut to...

INT. PAUL'S BEDROOM - LATER

Paul and Jules lie in bed. Jules looks nauseated.   Paul

offers her a pack of smokes.

INT. PAUL'S BATHROOM - LATER

Jules takes a shower, washing off the evidence.   She looks

nauseated by her lack of willpower.

the couch next to him. He doesn't look up.

Tanya moves imperceptibly closer.

Paul finally stops what he's doing.

Paul hesitates.   He doesn't know how to say no.

Tanya's face drops.

Paul just looks at her.   Tanya gets it.

Paul knows enough to say nothing.      Tanya gets up and walks

off.

Paul sits there, feeling like an asshole.

EXT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - MAGIC HOUR

The family packs into the Volvo to head to Paul's.

Mitchell's Blue.

Everyone digs into the meal, enjoying themselves.   Especially

Nic, who's committed to redeeming herself.

INT. PAUL'S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Nic washes her hands at the sink. Something catches her eye.

She lifts Paul's hairbrush from the shelf in front of her and

examines it. She reaches into the bristles and pulls out...

A few strands of long red hair.

Nic pales.

CUT TO

Nic on her knees in Paul's shower, pulling a clump of tell-

tale red hair from the drain.

CUT TO

Nic skulks out of the bathroom.   She looks out and b-lines

for the bedroom.

CUT TO

Nic pulling pillows off Paul's bed.   Her look tells us she's

found hair here as well.

THEN WE CUT TO

Nic sitting back down at the table. She looks drained.

Nobody notices. The sound drops out.

NIC'S POV:

Paul and Jules talking comfortably.

Joni and Laser chiming in, smiling, one big happy family.

REVERSE ONTO NIC:

Totally disconnected. Shell-shocked. She wants to scream

but it feels like she's trapped in cement. Things slow way

down...

OMITTED

INT. NIC AND JULES' BATHROOM - THAT NIGHT

Nic and Jules perform their nightly ablutions.   Jules is

sonic-caring her teeth.

Nic turns to her, eyes red with anger.

Jules pauses a second too long.   The jig is up.

INT. NIC AND JULES' BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER

The truth has come out.   Nic is so angry she's calm.

Nic starts heading for the door.    Jules follows.

Nic opens the door. There's Joni and Laser, looking

devastated. They've been listening to the whole thing.

INT. ALLGOOD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAWN

Jules wakes up looking crusty from a rough night on the

couch. She looks like she hasn't slept at all.
