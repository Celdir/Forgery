FADE IN:

INT. HARVEYS BEDROOM - NIGHT

A BEDROOM MIRROR.

The room is dark. A perfectly square mirror hangs crooked on

a wall.

Suddenly, out of the darkness, the reflection of a man's

face comes into focus. He stares straight ahead, perhaps

studying his own unrecognizable reflection. It's quite clear

this is a portrait of sickness; the man's pallor is gray,

his eyes are confused. There is something most definitely

wrong.

Tentatively, the figure steps away from the mirror, leaving

the frame empty and dark.

ANGLE ON BED

Like a ghost, the naked man (Harvey) stands over his bed

staring down at his sleeping wife (Joyce). In the eerie light,

he's almost translucent.

Joyce springs up, alarmed.

Harvey just stands there for a moment saying nothing.

Joyce rubs her eyes.

Joyce just stares at him, unsure how to answer. Suddenly

Harvey collapses.

Joyce leaps from the bed, nervous, hysterical. She gets down

on the floor and shakes him.

CLOSE ON HARVEY'S FACE

His eyes remain closed, his expression far, far away.

EXT. CLEVELAND ROW HOUSE - FALL - 1956 - DAY

FADE UP ON:

A surreal kaleidoscope of black, white and red. Similar to

the mirror scene above, the colors slowly come into focus,

revealing the chiseled features of a familiar face. But this

time we see that it is not a real face, but rather a plastic

mask of the D.C. Comic hero -- SUPERMAN.

INTERTITLE: CLEVELAND OHIO, 1956

CLOSE ON SUPERMAN MASK

It glows eerily in the light of a porch lamp. A child's pupils

glare through the eye holes...

The camera pans from SUPERMAN to the masked face of another

caped-crusader: BATMAN. Batman turns toward his loyal sidekick

ROBIN, who clutches a plastic, trick-or-treat pumpkin.

Next, we find THE GREEN LANTERN as he reaches up to ring the

doorbell. The camera finally rests on the last boy: an unkempt

KID wearing no costume at all. Looking irritated and removed

from the rest of the group, the KID shoves his hands in the

pockets of his shearling coat.

He spits and rolls his eyes as a lady answers the door.

The brick home is as working class as it gets. The lady at

the door is a 1950's HOUSEWIFE.

The Lady drops a candy apple in each boy's container.

She finally stops at the costumeless KID. He halfheartedly

holds up a ratty, stained pillowcase.

The other boys giggle. The kid flashes them a "kick yer ass"

look.

The kid shrugs.

The Housewife stares at him, confused.

Frustrated, the kid throws his pillowcase down. He trudges

off as the others watch in confusion.

BEGIN NERVOUS JAZZ SCORE

WE FOLLOW the schlumpy kid (aka HARVEY PEKAR) as he sulks

down the street...

EXT. CLEVELAND ROW HOUSE - FALL - 1975 - DUSK

INTERTITLE: CLEVELAND OHIO, 1975

A grown-up version of HARVEY PEKAR (now mid-thirties) stomps

along the same Cleveland street. Unfortunately, 20 years

have made this rust belt neighborhood a bit rustier. The

"GROWN UP HARVEY" dons the same shearling coat, sports the

same disheveled hair, and wears the same curmudgeonly

expression.

CREDIT SEQUENCE - ANIMATED SEQUENCE INTERCUT HARVEY WALKING

WITH COMIC BOOK PANELS OF THE CARTOON HARVEY IN ACTION. This

is not your typical super-hero stuff.

Instead it features our man engaging in such daredevil feats

as:

INT. CITY BUS - FALL 1975 - DAY

--Riding the city bus.

INT. V.A. HOSPITAL - DAY

--Working as a file clerk at the Veteran's Hospital.

INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT / KITCHEN - DAY

--Trying to wash dishes.

INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY

--Waiting on line at the supermarket.

EXT. GARAGE SALE - DAY

--Buying used records from a garage sale table.

INT. GREASY SPOON DINER - DAY

--Eating junk food at a greasy spoon.

INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Harvey fixes a rip in his coat with Elmer's Glue.

(Note: Each "Cartoon Harvey" looks similar but unique... A

variation on a theme. This is because his cartoons are drawn

by different comic artists.)

Intermittently, bold cartoon credits flash across the screen:

Followed by the explosive title:

The high-energy music and upbeat titles -- in direct contrast

to the sulking image of Harvey -- continue through the

remainder of the credits.

EXT. CLEVELAND STREET OVERLOOKING FACTORIES - DAY

We're now on HARVEY'S back as he continues his forlorn

journey. We move forward, past him, to peer over the hill at

the factories below.

SUDDENLY EVERYTHING -- THE MUSIC, THE CREDITS, THE IMAGES --

COMES TO A HALT.

INT. SOUND STAGE - PRESENT - DAY

HIGH DEFINITION VIDEO DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE

The REAL HARVEY PEKAR (not the actor who trudged through the

credits) sits behind a microphone, supplying the "voice over"

above. He clutches a movie script in his hand.

The frame is spare, with a few well-chosen items to indicate

that he's in a recording session.

Although he is significantly older than the man who portrays

him, the "Real Harvey" is every bit as much of a sad sack...

maybe even more. He is large and slightly threatening with

knitted brows and wild eyes. Yet there is something kind and

vulnerable about him -- a teddy bear who could kick your

ass. Off Camera, WE HEAR the voices of the male and female

directors (us -- BOB and SHARI) coaching the "Real Harvey"

through his voice over. Harvey's irritable and contrary,

saying that the whole Halloween incident never even happened.

"But I don't care man. I'm just doing this for the dough."

We learn that Harvey is a reluctant participant in a film

being made about his life.

SUDDENLY, his third wife JOYCE BRABNER -- an intelligent

control freak obsessed with all things negative -- joins in

the conversation. Pushing back her huge glasses, she

reprimands Harvey like he is an infant: "Harvey you are

talking too loud, Harvey you are being difficult." Harvey

just rolls his eyes. Joyce gets offended. It is clear they

have had this argument a million times. As Joyce storms off...

Harvey explains that his wife is trying to take over the

movie. He laments that she is his third wife, and he has no

luck with women. "Man, chicks just don't dig me." That's why

he marries anyone who will have him. "And I marry them fast

before they get to know the real me..."

INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - WINTER - 1975 - DAY

INTERTITLE: 1975

HARVEY sits on a table in his T-shirt and underwear. A DOCTOR

unwraps a tongue depressor.

Harvey's voice is hoarse, raspy and barely audible. It sounds

like it hurts for him to talk. Yet, he can't stop ranting.

He points the tongue depressor at Harvey's mouth but he just

keeps on going.

The Doctor shines a penlight into Harvey's mouth and looks

around.

He raises an eyebrow. Harvey catches this. Hypochondria

overtakes him.

The Doctor removes the penlight.

Harvey jumps off the table.

Relieved, Harvey calms down. He nods, agreeing to be good.

Suddenly Harvey's voice cracks under his effort to raise it.

He sheepishly grabs his throat.

Operate? Harvey gets nervous again. The Doctor throws him

his clothing.

EXT. CLEVELAND STREET - WINTER - 1975 - DAY

A silent sequence. A dejected HARVEY walks home alone along

an empty lot. Day-old dirty snow clings to the ground.

He wanders through a down-in-the-heels neighborhood, passing

run-down stores and ramshackle apartments.

EXT. BUS STOP - WINTER - 1975 - DAY

Harvey approaches TOBY -- a dumpy 20-something going on 60-

something in ridiculous, mismatched polyester clothing. He

is odd, awkward and talks with a monotone, robotic voice. In

short, he is a super dork.

Harvey barely looks up. He nods his head "yes" and keeps

walking.

Harvey leaves Toby behind and turns the corner.

EXT. DELI - WINTER - 1975 - DAY

Two WOMEN argue loudly over a payphone.

Harvey stops in his tracks and stares at them, jealous of

their ability to speak.

CLOSE UP: SPANISH WOMAN #1's MOUTH

Out of the corner of her eye, WOMAN #2 notices Harvey

eavesdropping.

Startled, Harvey moves on.

EXT. ACROSS FROM A PARK - WINTER - 1975 - DAY

He passes a group of KIDS playing in the snow. They scream,

yell and laugh with abandon.

Then, BAM! Harvey is awakened from his reverie by a snowball.

The kids laugh loudly. He wipes away the snow and walks on.

A VOICE OVER interrupts the scene.

EXT. BRIDGE OVER TRAIN TRACKS - DAY

Totally dejected, HARVEY crosses over train tracks on his

way home.

EXT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - WINTER - 1975 - DAY

Harvey sulks up the steps of his brick low-rise apartment

building. He passes an ELDERLY NEIGHBOR coming down the walk

with her shopping cart. Harvey unlocks the door.

INT. HARVEY'S LIVING ROOM - WINTER - 1975 - DAY

Harvey's second wife LANA -- a hippyish chic with long hair

and a bad attitude -- pulls books off a shelf and selectively

throws them onto the floor or packs them into a milk crate.

An overstuffed suitcase sits beside her. She's obviously

leaving him. HARVEY enters the room.

Harvey's voice breaks up.

That last yell did it. Harvey grabs throat in pain, torn

between his throat discomfort and trying to stop his wife

from leaving.

She gathers her bags and heads for the door. Harvey trails

her, trying to reason.

He opens his mouth, but nothing comes out.

She turns and stares at him. Harvey tries to say something.

But now nothing at all comes out of his mouth. Only wheezes

air.

He tries again. No sound at all.

Finally LANA gives up, turns back towards the door and leaves.

SLAM!!

INT. V.A. HOSPITAL - 1975 - DAY

At his cubicle in the file room, Harvey fills a cart with

files. He's physically at work, but mentally in a daze.

A nurse pops her head in. Harvey hands her a file.

He doesn't hear her, still stewing about LANA. He shoves the

last files in the cart and pushes it away.

INT. FILE ROOM -- A FEW MOMENTS LATER

We see rows and rows of endless files...

Still in a daze, Harvey removes the files from the cart and

puts them on the shelves.

Harvey turns around. Mr. Boats -- a portly, African-American

maintenance worker wearing a bow-tie -- steps into Harvey's

row. He has a tool box.

Harvey resumes shelving.

Mr. Boats laughs.

Somehow this doesn't make Harvey feel any better about his

life.

INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY -- DAY

Harvey carries an armful of files. Mr. Boats still trails

him, lugging his tool box.

Suddenly, Mr. Boats points out a young African-American FILE

CLERK wearing a pair of big headphones on his afro. He moves

as if he's listening to music.

Mr. Boats looks at him like he's crazy.

Mr. Boats stops and yells down the hall at Harvey.

Harvey shakes his head as Mr. Boats finishes his diatribe.

Mr. Boats turns into a room.

INT. SOUND STAGE - PRESENT - DAY

HIGH DEFINITION VIDEO DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE

Harvey sits on outdoor furniture. A few props are featured

in the frame indicating a garage-sale-like setting (including

a record player). Directly in front of Harvey are boxes of

used records.

HARVEY shows us his prodigious record collection. Thousands

of LP's -- rare jazz, blues, fusion, klezmer, etc. -- are

piled in floor-to-ceiling bookcases.

He tells us about his love of jazz and how he started writing

jazz reviews and music articles. He finds the first record

that he reviewed and puts it on his turntable. As the music

plays...

Harvey talks about how he started buying and selling records.

This leads into how he first met ROBERT CRUMB.

EXT. CLEVELAND GARAGE SALE - FALL - 1962 - DAY

INTERTITLE: 1962

HARVEY (a little more hair but the exact same style) and a

bunch of his BUDDIES sift through old records at a junk sale.

One of Harvey's pals -- MARTY -- pulls a record out of a

box.

Harvey jumps up from his search to check out the LP.

A skinny guy with a big nose, glasses and a ratty trench

coat taps Harvey on the shoulder. He is soft-spoken, a bit

shy and very odd -- a young ROBERT CRUMB.

A greaser-type guy in a leather jacket, PAHLS, joins them.

INT. HARVEY'S LIVING ROOM - FALL - 1962 - DAY

A disheveled mess that gives new meaning to the term bachelor

pad. Records and books are strewn everywhere.

HARVEY marches back and forth holding Crumb's illustrated

comic novel. CRUMB sits on the floor nursing a beer and

sorting through vintage comic books. Harvey's bursting with

so much enthusiasm, it's almost aggressive.

Crumb ignores Harvey's praise.

Harvey flops down in an overstuffed chair. Stuffing flies

out. He sips his beer.

Harvey flips through the book.

Crumb is immune to Harvey's enthusiasm.

INT. HARVEY'S LIVING ROOM - FALL - 1962 - LATER

CRUMB lies on the couch sketching while HARVEY reads more of

THE YUM YUM BOOK. A scratchy jazz record plays.

ANGLE ON CRUMB'S DRAWING

We see Crumb is actually sketching Harvey, slumped in a chair

reading a book. Crumb makes Harvey look like a smelly, sweaty

madman with ratty clothing.

Crumb holds the sketch of Harvey up to show him.

Harvey glances up at his portrait, completely unselfconscious.

Harvey goes back to reading. Crumb back to sketching.

Crumb slowly evaporates from the room, leaving Harvey totally

alone.

ANGLE ON 45 RECORD SPINNING AND SPINNING

The record spins and spins...

END FLASHBACK

EXT. BUS STOP - 1975 - DAY

ANOTHER R. CRUMB DRAWING OF HARVEY (Now circa 1975)

On a sketch pad we see a deranged, tormented Harvey sitting

alone on a park bench. He pulls at his hair, and looks as

though he may murder the next person who walks by.

INTERTITLE: BACK TO 1975

As the pencil adds shading to Harvey's face, WE HEAR:

HARVEY and R. CRUMB sit on a park bench together by a bus

stop. A distraught Harvey whines while Crumb just sketches.

Harvey's voice is still raspy.

Crumb may or may not be listening to Harvey. It's hard to

tell.

For a moment, they both just sit there saying nothing to

each other, each man in his own private universe.

Finally Harvey looks over to Crumb.

Crumb never looks up from his picture.

Harvey nods in agreement, mulling this over. He's not at all

offended.

INT. V.A. HOSPITAL - 1975 - DAY

CLOSE ON A FILE DRAWER MARKED: "RECENTLY DECEASED."

A hand reaches into the frame and opens the drawer.

By rote, HARVEY fumbles with a large stack of "expired

patient" files. He places each into the appropriate

alphabetical "deceased" drawer.

Attempting to grab another batch, Harvey accidentally knocks

the entire pile onto the floor.

He crouches down to survey the mess -- a collage of "expired

lives" laid out before his eyes.

We move past dozens of anonymous names -- William Anderson,

Louis Collins, Mark D'Amico, Tyrone Moore, Franklin Ray,

etc... Each file has a red "Deceased" stamp.

Depressed, HARVEY is transfixed by the files surrounding him

on the floor. Suddenly he stops and picks one up.

ANGLE ON FOLDER: It is marked, "CHARLIE MARSHALL."

He opens the folder and reads the stats...

Born: 1920 in Cleveland Died: 1920 in Cleveland Occupation:

Clerk

ANGLE ON HARVEY: He swallows hard as he reads about Charlie's

small, invisible and now vanished life... He tosses the folder

back onto the pile.

INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - 1975 - MORNING

CLOSE ON: TWO STICK FIGURES IN AN EMPTY FRAME

HARVEY sits at a table with a pen in hand and a blank sheet

of paper in front of him. Nothing seems to come to him.

He flips through a pile of comic books -- everything from

D.C. Comic Super Heroes to underground works such as Crumb's

Mr. Natural and Zap Comix. No inspiration. Harvey throws

them down in frustration.

INT. SUPERMARKET - 1975 - DAY

HARVEY pushes a cart through the cramped aisles of a crowded

supermarket. He pulls a few cans of Beef-A-Roni off the shelf

and heads off to pay. Reaching the check-out area, he

evaluates the situation.

ANGLE ON CHECK-OUT COUNTERS:

There are three lines to choose from. Two of the counters

have long waits. The third is much shorter but there is an

OLD JEWISH LADY next in line.

SUDDENLY, THE SCREEN SPLITS IN TWO:

The LEFT SIDE OF THE FRAME remains Harvey at the supermarket

deliberating over the check-out lines.

However, the RIGHT SIDE OF THE FRAME now contains a CRUMB

STYLE COMIC PANEL DEPICTING THE EXACT SAME SCENARIO. A BUBBLE

appears over CARTOON HARVEY'S head revealing his thoughts.

It reads: "Pickin' the right check-out line is an art...

There's a lot of things you gotta consider."

ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE FRAME... Harvey decides to get behind

the Old Lady.

MEANWHILE ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE FRAME... Cartoon

Harvey stands behind the Old Lady.

A new BUBBLE reads: "It may be the shortest line but I am

takin' a chance 'cause she's an Old Jewish Lady."

BACK TO THE LEFT SIDE OF THE FRAME... The CASHIER rings up

the Old Lady's purchases -- a few kitchen glasses.

Harvey rolls his eyes and stamps his foot impatiently. He

knows he's in trouble now.

SUDDENLY, THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE SCREEN BECOMES FULLY

ANIMATED... Instead of still comic panels with balloons, the

Cartoon Harvey now rants directly into the camera.

The Human Harvey seems oblivious to his cartoon replica. He

impatiently leans on his cart, waiting and seething.

ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE SCREEN... The MANAGER finally

arrives. The Old Lady haggles with him, too.

MEANWHILE ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE... The Cartoon Harvey turns

to address the Human Harvey, who actually looks him in the

eyes. It now seems Human Harvey can actually hear his cartoon

alter ego.

IN AN INSTANT, THE CARTOON HARVEY DISAPPEARS AND THE LIVE

ACTION SCENE TAKES OVER THE WHOLE FRAME.

Suddenly motivated by an odd notion, Harvey abandons his

grocery cart and runs out of the supermarket.

INT. HARVEY'S KITCHEN -- NIGHT

Bursting with ideas, Harvey (wearing his undershirt and

boxers) starts story-boarding his first comic with stick

figures.

INT. HARVEY'S KITCHEN - 1975 - MORNING

A bleary-eyed HARVEY, still clad in an undershirt and boxers,

dozes off over a bowl of Corn Flakes. On the table next to

some spilled milk are a stack of papers covered with

scribbling. He clearly has been slaving over this work all

night.

ANGLE ON PAPERS:

At the top is a quickly scribbled title, "Standing Behind

Old Jewish Ladies In Supermarket Lines." These are ad hoc

versions of a comic book. The pages are divided like a tick-

tack-toe board. Each square is filled with crude stick figure

drawings and lots of writing.

An alarm clock goes off. Harvey's eyes fly open.

Harvey yawns, then notices the pile of papers. He peruses

them, proud of his work. He gets up and looks out the window.

I/E. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - HARVEY'S POV - 1975 - MORNING

It is yet another grey day in Cleveland. The neighborhood is

run-down. Garbage is strewn everywhere.

The following scene unfolds through the window:

Two UNSIGHTLY WORKERS lug an old, smelly mattress from a

garage towards the garbage cans on the curb. Their

conversation is distant, but entirely audible.

They drop the mattress in place. With the window framing

these guys, the scene FREEZES, looking just like a comic

book panel.

INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Harvey turns around from the scene and ponders it. He moves

back towards his pile of stick-figure drawings.

CLOSE ON PAPER

Harvey scribbles the words "AMERICAN SPLENDOR" at the top of

the page.

INT. CLEVELAND DINER - 1975 - DAY

The following scene is shot through the restaurant window.

We see reflections of people walking by.

A tense HARVEY starts at CRUMB as he eats a burger and reads

Harvey's mock-ups. Harvey doesn't touch his burger deluxe

and nervously talks in his laryngitis-afflicted voice.

Crumb finally looks up from Harvey's work.

Crumb reads more. Harvey waits anxiously. Finally Crumb starts

to chuckle.

Crumb shuffles through more.

Harvey is practically bursting.

Harvey's voice breaks like a kid in puberty. He clears his

throat. And something miraculous happens...

When Harvey opens his mouth to speak his LARYNGITIS IS GONE!

INT. V.A. HOSPITAL - SNACK ROOM HALLWAY - DAY

HARVEY bounds towards the snack room where a group of hospital

workers and patients hang out. He bangs on the window to get

their attention. When they look up, Harvey waves a comic

book in the air.

INT. V.A. HOSPITAL - SNACK ROOM - DAY

A GLOSSY, FULL-COLOR COMIC BOOK FEATURING THE TWO MATTRESS

GUYS: Scrawled across the top in big red letters reads,

"AMERICAN SPLENDOR. Vol. #1" A man's finger points to the

words, "All Stories by Harvey Pekar. Art by R. Crumb." The

comic book sits atop a table in the dreary snack room.

A crowd of HOSPITAL WORKERS, PATIENTS, DOCTORS, MAINTENANCE

WORKERS, etc. (under ten total) gather around a proud HARVEY

who shows off his work. For the first time, he seems almost

happy.

A WWII VET PATIENT with a portable IV cranes to get a glimpse.

DOCTOR #3 chimes in.

TOBY, the supernerd from the bus stop, grabs the comic book

off the table and peruses it.

SUDDENLY, MR. BOATS -- Harvey's philosophical co-worker --

pushes his way thorough the crowd. He snatches the comic out

of Toby's hand.

As Mr. Boats talks, the crowd starts to disperse.

Mr. Boats hands the comic book back to Harvey and turns on

his heels. Through the window he notices TWO VETS IN

WHEELCHAIRS moving down the hall.

Harvey stands there, his moment of glory passed. But it's

okay. He flips through his comic and smiles.

EXT. STREET CORNER - ASSOC. OF POLISH WOMEN - 1975 - DAY

A motley group of GUYS hang out on a street corner in front

of the Association of Polish Women. HARVEY heads towards

them.

Harvey rolls his eyes.

Harvey turns red. He's embarrassed but part of him loves the

attention.

The GUYS laugh.

ANGLE ON SILENT GUY

A SILENT GUY crouches by the wall, reading his CLEVELAND

BROWNS trading cards.

Harvey hangs with the guys but he doesn't engage. He seems

to be observing them more than interacting with them.

The guys all stare at him for a moment. Then they crack up.

issues and how they impacted his life -- recognition as a

INT. HARVEY'S CUBICLE - V.A. HOSPITAL - 1980'S - DAY

HARVEY sits alone in his cubicle. He doodles stick figures

on a pad -- some ideas for a new comic. His posture's

miserable. He rubs his temples like he's in anguish.

JUMP CUT SEQUENCE

Several shots of Harvey just thinking, scratching his face

with a pencil, tapping his foot nervously.

Each shot is separated by a second or two of black (an homage

to Harvey's wordless panels). Finally, he goes back to

Harvey turns around. He seems down, depressed.

Toby watches Harvey eat a few.

Toby heads down a file row and proceeds to take a few off

the shelves, stuffing his bag. Harvey gets up and comes after

him.

Toby turns on his heels and walks off.

Toby doesn't respond.

Harvey shrugs and digs deep into the jelly bean bag. He pulls

out a fistful.

THE ACTOR HARVEY stands alone, his hand filled with Jelly

beans.

ACTOR HARVEY steps out of the frame, revealing a craft service

table behind him. At the table, the REAL HARVEY and the REAL

TOBY load up on donuts. The two discuss the food on the set.

Ironically, the Real Toby is actually more extreme than the

Actor who plays him -- even more robotic, and completely

incapable of eye-contact.

The REAL TOBY discusses the finer points of nerdom and

evaluates the Actor's nerd quotient. The Real Harvey explains

to Actor Toby that nothing -- not even gourmet jelly beans --

would have cheered him up at that point in his life.

He was too lonely and depressed.

It is a beautiful, sunny day. The trees are in bloom.

There's the first scent of spring in the air. Kids play in

HARVEY surveys the donuts.

A woman with attractive Irish looks brushes past Harvey on

her way to the door. This is ALICE QUINN, roughly Harvey's

age but there is a tired, weary look in her eyes.

Half in a daze, Harvey stares at the chick.

Harvey studies her face. Suddenly, it clicks.

Harvey pays and receives his items. They step back towards

the door.

Harvey scratches his armpit.

This perks Harvey up.

Harvey stares at her wedding ring. His face drops.

Alice laughs.

Alice smiles.

This hits home with Harvey. He can't believe he's made such

Alice stops in front of a beat-up station wagon.

Harvey looks down, a little sad.

Alice pecks Harvey on the cheek.

She gets into the car.

Harvey watches as she drives off.

INT. HARVEY'S LIVING ROOM - SPRING - 1980'S - NIGHT

The room is moody, dark and lonely. The shadowy figure of

Harvey sits on the floor devouring JENNIE GERHARDT.

THE CAMERA TRAVELS AROUND THE ROOM TO FIND: Harvey again,

now silhouetted in the door frame, still clutching the book

and obsessed by his thoughts.

THE CAMERA TRAVELS AGAIN TO FIND Harvey sitting on a chair

in the corner of his room. His head is bowed. His shoulders

slump over, as if he's struggling with something weighty.

THE CAMERA TRAVELS A FINAL TIME TO FIND: Harvey sprawled

across his couch. But he's not asleep; he's still obsessing.

The book lies on his chest like a lover.

CLOSE UP of Harvey's troubled face. Beneath the pain, we see

hope and determination.

EXT. COSMIC COMICS STORE - DELAWARE - 1980'S - DAY

An urban comic book shop on a dicey but bohemian street. A

title over picture reads, "MEANWHILE, IN DELAWARE."

INT. COSMIC COMICS STORE - 1980'S - DAY

JOYCE BRABNER, a depressive nudge with a perpetually peptic

expression frantically searches the store for something. Her

partner, a granola type named RAND, finishes unloading a

stack on the shelf.

Joyce leans against the counter. She pushes up her glasses

and looks really upset.

Joyce starts slamming things around the store. Finally Rand

grabs his stuff.

Rand leaves. Joyce barely notices, still brewing.

INT. JOYCE'S BEDROOM - 1980'S - NIGHT

The mess in this room rivals Harvey's. A few cats add to the

Joyce sighs and lies down. A variety of AMERICAN SPLENDORS

are across her bed. Different interpretations of Harvey stare

up at her.

Joyce smiles for the first time.

INT. AIRPORT - ARRIVALS GATE - 1980'S - DAY

A nervous JOYCE walks off the plane into the arrivals area.

She scans the crowd of friends, family, lovers and limo

drivers waiting to meet the disembarking passengers. Where

is Harvey? What will he look like?

As Joyce surveys the unfamiliar faces, she imagines different

versions of an animated, illustrated Harvey among the people.

She double-takes as sees the R. CRUMB HARVEY -- hairy, scary,

smelly and picking his nose. Joyce rubs her eyes.

Next she sees the BRANDO HARVEY (Gary Dumm), but unfortunately

he disappears fast.

Disappointed, Joyce notices the realistic DREW FRIEDMAN HARVEY

walking towards her. She smiles as he dissolves into:

Joyce turns around. The flesh and blood HARVEY PEKAR stands

before her -- not quite as bad as the Crumb version, not

quite as good as the Dumm version, but still acceptable. She

sighs with relief.

She politely offers her hand. Harvey shakes it, but he looks

overwhelmed, worried and pessimistic.

Joyce lets go of his hand. She stares at him in disbelief.

INT. TGIF STYLE RESTAURANT - 1980'S - NIGHT

The most awkward date in history. Seated in an ultra-yuppie

restaurant filled with business lunchers, Harvey and Joyce

hide behind their menus. While everyone else looks slick and

successful, these two compete for the world's worst posture.

Harvey shakes his head, feeling more pessimistic.

Joyce grabs a bread stick.

Harvey just stares at her.

A cheery waitress bounces over.

They slowly look up at her.

INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - 1980'S - NIGHT

JOYCE and HARVEY enter the apartment. The place is a mess,

as usual.

Joyce puts down her bag.

She slumps down on the sofa as if she's been here a million

times. She rubs her head. Harvey sits next to her.

Harvey just bounces back up and obeys.

Harvey empties the aspirin bottle in his palm. For some

reason, he's feeling more comfortable.

Harvey arrives back with the aspirin. He hands it to Joyce.

Joyce swallows the pill. Harvey sits down next to her.

They're inches away from each other.

She pulls him close. Harvey plants a kiss on her.

They slowly separate. Joyce's eyes are closed. She likes

him. He kisses her again. They start making out, moaning a

bit.

But before it gets heavy --

Joyce opens her eyes. She looks uneasy.

INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM DOOR - 1980'S - DAY

Harvey stands by the bathroom door, despondent. From inside

we hear the sounds of moaning and flushing.

INT. HARVEY'S BATHROOM - DAY

FLUSH! Joyce is doubled over on the toilet. She's looking

green.

INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM DOOR - DAY

OUTSIDE THE DOOR

INT. HARVEY'S BATHROOM - DAY

Joyce gets to her feet and puts her glasses back on. She

picks up a can and sprays air freshener around the room.

Then she looks at the can and realizes it's WD-40.

Joyce puts the can down.

Joyce turns her head to the door. She's truly surprised by

what Harvey's just said. And very moved. She smiles to

herself.

INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM DOOR - DAY

Harvey stands there waiting.

Joyce slowly opens the door. She leans against the door frame

like she's just been through a war.

She takes off her glasses and cleans them off with her shirt.

INT. HARVEY'S BEDROOM - 1980'S - DAY

Harvey and Joyce are in bed, lying in each other's arms.

They look quite contented.

She shrugs.

EXT. PARKING LOT - V.A. HOSPITAL - 1980'S - DAY

HARVEY approaches the building. Instead of dragging his feet

like usual, he seems to be floating on a cloud. We haven't

seen Harvey this happy since... well, since never.

He stops by a junker car and peeks in the window, finding

TOBY eating lunch alone. He has an entire White Castle

smorgasbord spread across the front seat.

Harvey knocks on the window. Toby rolls it down.

Harvey reaches for a handful of Toby's fries.

Harvey leans in, always amused by Toby. He steals another

fry.

Harvey opens the car door and slides in with Toby.

Toby spills some catsup on his polyester button-down shirt.

He stands up to get a napkin, revealing his flood pants.

Harvey grabs the rest of Toby's fries and opens the door to

leave.

Toby watches Harvey saunter off. He returns to his last

hamburger.

EXT. MOVIE THEATER - 1980'S - NIGHT

A brightly lit marquee reads, "REVENGE OF THE NERDS." The

doors to the theater open and a crowd pours onto the street.

HARVEY, JOYCE and TOBY are among them. Toby proudly wears a

"Genuine Nerd" button on his striped shirt.

Harvey scrunches his face in disbelief.

Joyce hits Harvey.

Joyce folds her arms in disapproval. Toby starts to laugh.

Harvey looks at him, disappointed. He shakes his head.

EXT. TOBY'S CAR -- A FEW MOMENTS LATER

ANGLE ON TOBY'S CAR (THROUGH WINDSHIELD)

Toby and Joyce continue to analyze the movie in the front

seat as Toby starts the ignition.

INT. TOBY'S CAR

ANGLE ON HARVEY IN BACK SEAT

Slouched, grumpy and alone on the back seat, Harvey's still

annoyed by the movie.

INT. REHEARSAL STUDIO - PRESENT - DAY

HIGH DEFINITION VIDEO DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE

A few items indicating film production are in the frame.

At a table in the foreground, BOB THE DIRECTOR discusses the

character of Joyce with the ACTRESS playing her. The actress

just nods as the director goes on.

We can see THE REAL JOYCE sitting with THE REAL HARVEY in

the distance.

THE REAL JOYCE and REAL HARVEY listen curiously -- sometimes

pleased, sometimes displeased -- as their personalities are

dissected and boiled down to a few phrases.

CLOSER SHOT OF REAL JOYCE AND HARVEY

The REAL JOYCE puts in her two cents about the actress playing

her. She rants about what it's like to be portrayed in a

movie, and having a character arc imposed on her life.

She moves into talking about her relationship with Harvey,

and the first years of their marriage -- how impossible it

was to live with him.

The REAL HARVEY just rolls his eyes.

END HIGH DEFINITION VIDEO DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE

INT. HARVEY'S LIVING ROOM - 1980'S - DAY

JOYCE is on a cleaning rampage. She rummages through piles

upon piles of records while HARVEY paces nervously.

Joyce throws down the records in frustration. Harvey runs

over to check if they're scratched.

A DOOR BUZZER rings. Harvey slams it to unlock the front.

A KNOCK ON THE DOOR interrupts their argument. Joyce storms

away to answer it.

ANGLE ON THE DOOR:

Joyce opens it to face a smiling TOBY -- dressed as usual in

a loud polyester fashion don't. He talks in his strange

robotic voice and avoids all eye contact.

Joyce turns to Harvey and points to Toby.

This scene shrinks into a square up in the corner. The next

few scenes (NEUROSIS MONTAGE) further divide up the full

screen like a comic book.

INT. CLEVELAND COMIC BOOK STORE - 1980'S - DAY

R. CRUMB leaps from behind an autograph table (where he's

signing comics) to hop on the back of ZAFTIG BABE, who offers

him a piggy-back ride.

Joyce turns to Harvey.

EXT. PARKING LOT - V.A. HOSPITAL - 1980'S - DAY

JOYCE picks up Harvey from work. HARVEY enters the car, waving

goodbye to the ranting MR. BOATS.

She points to Mr. Boats.

INT. HARVEY'S LIVING ROOM - 1980'S - DAY

THE TELEPHONE RINGS. A disheveled, tired-looking JOYCE flips

through a novel and lets the machine pick up.

Joyce flips the page.

END NEUROSIS MONTAGE (return to full screen)

INT. THEATER - 1980'S - EVENING

HARVEY and JOYCE sit in a packed theater watching a play.

Joyce looks exhausted.

ANGLE ON STAGE

A STAGE ACTOR HARVEY and a STAGE ACTOR JOYCE share a couch

on the sparse stage.

The "Stage Actor Joyce" lunges over and plants a kiss on

him.

ANGLE ON HARVEY AND JOYCE IN AUDIENCE

Harvey digs it but Joyce looks disgusted.

BACK TO STAGE

We now see STAGE ACTOR HARVEY clutching a tea cup, as STAGE

ACTOR JOYCE kneels before a toilet bowl. Off to the side of

the stage, A SPOT LIGHT illuminates a GUITAR PLAYER, who

adds music to the scene.

INT. AIRPORT - 1980'S - DAY

HARVEY and JOYCE walk through the terminal. Harvey brims

with energy but Joyce looks exhausted.

INT. AIRPORT - BAGGAGE CLAIM - 1980'S - DAY

Harvey nervously taps his foot as he waits for the bags.

Joyce leans against the carousel staring at a YOUNG MOTHER

with a BABY in a Bjorn.

He checks his watch. Joyce remains quiet and distant.

Harvey spots a bag that he thinks is his.

Suddenly, Joyce mumbles something to Harvey.

Heads turn.

More heads turn.

Joyce folds her arms... dejected, defeated. The audience of

eavesdroppers looks disappointed as well.

INT. HARVEY'S LIVING ROOM - 1980'S - DAY

If the place was a disaster before, believe it or not, it's

gotten worse. JOYCE seems to have given up on her

organizing... and everything else for that matter.

HARVEY hysterically searches through the mess for a record

album. Joyce just lies listlessly on an open futon on the

middle of the room; it looks as if she hasn't been up in

days.

Joyce rolls over.

Joyce sits up. This time she means business.

She rolls over and covers her head with the pillow. Harvey

just stands there staring at her.

INT. SUPERMARKET - 1980'S - DAY

HARVEY peruses the aisles. He pulls box upon box of herbal

tea off the shelves.

INT. HARVEY'S LIVING ROOM - 1980'S - DAY

HARVEY throws boxes of herbal teas at JOYCE as she sprawls

listlessly on the futon. She just yawns and turns over on

her side.

A frustrated Harvey tries once more to cheer her up.

Harvey throws his hands in the air and walks off.

As he passes the answering machine, he notices it's blinking.

Joyce doesn't respond.

He presses the play button.

ANGLE ON ANSWERING MACHINE: A loud "beep," then ...

Joyce sits up. Harvey's finger hits the "Replay" button.

EXT. MANHATTAN SKYLINE - 1980'S - DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT

The impressive skyline glistens in the spring sun.

EXT. WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK - NEW YORK - 1980'S - DAY

Armed with shopping bags from Bleecker Bob's Record Shop,

the Strand Book Store and Forbidden Planet Comic Book

Emporium, HARVEY and JOYCE eat lunch on a park bench. Harvey

chomps on a knish and watches oddball New Yorkers stroll by

as Joyce nibbles on her hot dog.

INT. HOTEL HALLWAY -- DAY

CLOSE UP ON AN ICE BUCKET

Cut back to reveal Harvey, schlepping an ice bucket down a

hall in his underwear. A FEMALE BUSINESS TRAVELER passes and

stares at him. He enters a room with a "DO NOT DISTURB" sign.

INT. NEW YORK HOTEL ROOM - 1980'S - DAY

The PEKARS have already wreaked havoc on their luxury hotel

room. It looks like a tornado touched down on the New York

Hilton.

HARVEY tries on outfits for the big show. He pulls a wrinkled

T-shirt over his head and models it for JOYCE who is spread

out on the bed surrounded by piles of clothing, scissors and

sewing supplies. She glances up at Harvey's getup and shakes

her head no.

Harvey tosses his shirt over to Joyce, who snatches it and

starts cutting it with a scissor.

She resumes her mysterious sewing project; she seems to be

making some kind of doll.

INT. GREEN ROOM - NBC STUDIOS - 1980'S - DAY

Backstage, JOYCE watches LATE NIGHT WITH DAVID LETTERMAN on

a monitor as HARVEY awaits his turn to go on camera. He has

changed out of his wrinkled T-shirt into a slightly more

formal look -- a denim shirt and a ratty seersucker striped

jacket.

LETTERMAN SHOW - STOCK FOOTAGE

ANGLE ON MONITOR (NOTE: THIS IS ACTUAL STOCK FOOTAGE OF THE

SHOW)

A 1980's DAVID LETTERMAN wisecracks.

INT. GREEN ROOM - NBC STUDIOS - 1980'S - DAY

Neither Joyce nor Harvey look particularly impressed with

the whole deal.

Harvey paces.

A nervous STAGE MANAGER wearing a headset peeks his head in.

Harvey glances at the monitor just as Letterman announces

his next guest.

INT. GREEN ROOM - NBC STUDIOS - 1980'S - DAY

The stage manager grabs Harvey by the arm. Joyce stops them.

The Stage Manager physically pushes Harvey out of the Green

Room. Joyce turns back to face the monitor.

LETTERMAN SHOW - STOCK FOOTAGE

ANGLE ON MONITOR

Letterman holds up a copy of a full-size glossy AMERICAN

SPLENDOR ANTHOLOGY.

THE HARVEY PEKAR WHO WALKS ONTO THE SET IS NOT THE ACTOR

PORTRAYING HIM BUT RATHER THE REAL HARVEY PEKAR (only about

15 years younger). THIS IS ACTUAL STOCK FOOTAGE FROM HARVEY'S

FIRST LETTERMAN APPEARANCE.

INT. GREEN ROOM - NBC STUDIOS - DAY

Joyce watches as Harvey shakes Letterman's hand and takes a

seat.

LETTERMAN SHOW - STOCK FOOTAGE

He smiles as the audience warmly greets him. It seems Harvey's

grooving on this attention. But as soon as the audience quiets

down, Harvey turns to his host and starts his offensive:

Taken off guard, Letterman laughs.

INT. GREEN ROOM - NBC STUDIOS - 1980'S - DAY

ANGLE ON JOYCE WATCHING

LETTERMAN SHOW - STOCK FOOTAGE

Now, Letterman cracks up.

INT. GREEN ROOM - NBC STUDIOS - 1980'S - DAY

A LETTERMAN REGULAR (Tony Randall?) comes in with some food.

He stops by the monitor to watch a moment with Joyce.

The Letterman Regular takes a seat as he watches the monitor.

He seems more intrigued than Joyce.

LETTERMAN SHOW - STOCK FOOTAGE

This hits a sore spot. Harvey goes from politely condescending

to cantankerous in one second flat!

Letterman cracks up. The Audience laughs even harder.

The Audience can't believe this guy's holding his own with

Letterman.

INT. GREEN ROOM - NBC STUDIOS - 1980'S - DAY

ANGLE ON LETTERMAN REGULAR

Suddenly, Joyce walks over to the monitor and looks for the

channel. She hits a button, but it only changes the frame of

the show.

Joyce gives up. She sinks back into her seat and pulls a

book from her bag. The Letterman Regular stares at her like

she's from Mars.

LETTERMAN SHOW - STOCK FOOTAGE

ANGLE ON THE MONITOR

Once again laughs and a big round of applause. Letterman

pulls out Joyce's mysterious doll and props it up on the

table.

INT. GREEN ROOM - NBC STUDIOS - 1980'S - DAY

BACK TO JOYCE.

She suddenly perks up.

LETTERMAN SHOW - STOCK FOOTAGE CLOSE-UP OF THE DOLL

It is an absolutely horrific but oddly evocative "Harvey Rag

Doll." His face is inspired by Crumb's drawings of Harvey

but even more extreme. His little T-shirt reads, "American

Splendor." The Audience is in stitches.

INT. GREEN ROOM - NBC STUDIOS - 1980'S - DAY

JOYCE stares at the monitor, expressionless. The STAGE MANAGER

sticks his head in.

The Stage Manager grabs the Regular.

A smiling HARVEY (the actor now) waltzes in straight from

his command performance.

Joyce taps her finger on Letterman's image on the monitor.

INT. NEW YORK HOTEL ROOM - 1980'S - DAY

HARVEY tries on a ripped T-shirt for Joyce who lies on the

bed.

HARVEY, in a ratty T-shirt, spars with LETTERMAN.

The Audience laughs.

LETTERMAN SHOW - STOCK FOOTAGE - ANOTHER SHOW

LETTERMAN introduces his favorite guest.

HARVEY walks out with a box of donuts. He starts giving

Letterman an earful right off the bat.

INT. WHITE CASTLE - 1980'S - DAY

The burger joint has been transformed into a film set with

lights, cameras and lots of trendy MTV types.

OFF TO THE SIDE:

Two HOT BABES slave over TOBY as he gets his hair and make-

up done.

HARVEY wanders onto the set. He finally spots Toby in the

corner. As he heads over to say hello, Harvey bumps into the

MTV DIRECTOR -- a new wave fashion victim who looks like a

lost member of A FLOCK OF SEAGULLS.

MTV PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT

TOBY, dressed in dark sunglasses and a turtleneck, stands in

front of a White Castle. He delivers his lines in his

trademark robotic style. There's an MTV logo on the bottom

of the screen.

INT. CLEVELAND DINER - 1980'S - DAY

HARVEY and JOYCE eat breakfast together. Harvey reads a

Katherine Mansfield book as JOYCE reads a newspaper.

A YUPPIE in a jogging suit walks up to Harvey, interrupting

Joyce in mid-sentence.

Harvey's not smiling anymore. This guy's a jerk.

The Yuppie rushes out.

Joyce hits a nerve.

People start to look over.

Joyce doesn't dignify Harvey with an answer. She stares at

him, her eyes well with hurt.

He sighs, calming down. He looks around sheepishly.

He grabs her hand.

EXT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - 1980'S - DAY

Harvey and Joyce stroll across the lawn holding hands. They

move towards a waiting cab. Harvey carries his wife's bags.

They stop by the cab.

They kiss. Harvey grudgingly puts her bags in the car. He

watches as the cab pulls away.

INT. HARVEY'S BEDROOM - 1980'S - NIGHT

Wearing only his shorts, Harvey lies alone in the communal

futon, flipping through a book. He reaches into his underwear

to scratch his nuts.

Suddenly he stops. He feels something odd...

For a moment he just freezes. His eyes register panic.

INT. V.A. HOSPITAL - 1980'S - DAY

An enraged HARVEY fights with his co-worker MIGUEL.

Offended, Miguel storms off.

INT. HARVEY'S LIVING ROOM - 1980'S - NIGHT

Alone and slumped over his table, HARVEY draws comic ideas

with stick figures. Nothing's coming to him. He looks like

he's in anguish.

Frustrated, Harvey crumbles the idea and throws it on the

floor. He knocks over a chair.

INT. HARVEY'S BEDROOM - 1980'S - DAY

He tosses and turns in bed. No way he's sleeping.

INT. HARVEY'S LIVING ROOM - 1980'S - DAY

HARVEY is yelling into the telephone. It is a bad connection.

INT. BACK STAGE - NBC STUDIOS - 1980'S - DAY

Without Joyce, a surly Harvey waits in the wings for his

introduction. He sneaks a peek as Letterman finishes up the

"stupid pet tricks" segment. We hear dogs barking and audience

laughter.

Harvey clenches his fists.

Harvey takes off his shirt. He pulls another t-shirt out of

the bag and changes ...

Harvey's new t-shirt reads "ON STRIKE AGAINST NBC." He takes

off for the stage, fists clenched, a soldier marching off to

war.

INT. GREEN ROOM - NBC STUDIOS - 1980'S - DAY

We're positioned behind the monitor, so we can only hear the

show. THE STAGE MANAGER AND TWO PRODUCTION ASSISTANTS

straighten up in the room.

As the P.A.'s walk back and forth in front of the monitor,

we hear the Letterman / Pekar banter grow louder.

Suddenly PRODUCTION ASSISTANT #2 stops and checks out the

monitor.

INT. TOBY'S LIVING ROOM - 1980'S - DAY

TOBY and his GRANDMOTHER watch HARVEY raise hell on Letterman.

Again, we can't see the screen.

Toby's grandmother passes him a plate of cookies.

INT. MR. BOAT'S KITCHEN - 1980'S - DAY

Dressed in a bathrobe, Mr. Boats eats a lonely, late-night

snack (cake and milk) at his kitchen table. A 12" TV on the

table has Harvey and Dave on.

Mr. Boats shakes his head.

INT. TOWN CAR - 1980'S - DAY

We see Harvey alone, slumped in the back seat of a Town Car,

heading back towards his hotel. City lights pass over his

troubled face. We still hear the show, as if it's now in his

head.

INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - 1980'S - NIGHT

CLOSE ON AN AMERICAN SPLENDOR COMIC

The cover depicts a snarling LETTERMAN yelling, "YOU FUCKED

UP A GREAT THING!" at a smirking, self-satisfied HARVEY.

JOYCE lies in bed reading the comic, chuckling. HARVEY cuddles

up against her.

Joyce puts the magazine down.

She cuddles up close to him.

She starts to kiss him. He kisses her back. Her hands wander

down. Suddenly she feels something strange.

Harvey looks at her and gulps.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - 1980'S - DAY

HARVEY and JOYCE sit in the office holding hands, like two

terrified high school kids. A DOCTOR stands before them.

They just got bad news...

The doctor gently nods.

Joyce covers her mouth. Harvey holds onto his head. He looks

positively dizzy. The doctor starts to talk, yet the words

don't seem to match his mouth. He looks dubbed. Strange

phrases just weave together, echo and bounce off the wall,

making no sense at all.

...we know the growth is malignant. What we don't know is

how far it may have spread. Once we have the results of the

biopsy, we can make more informed decisions about treatment...

blah, blah, blah...

The whole office seems to spin.

INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - 1980'S - LATER

Joyce and Harvey sit on the stoop of their apartment house,

in a daze. The words keep echoing around them. Harvey holds

his head.

Harvey turns to Joyce.

Joyce stands up, determined.

Despite Joyce's passionate pitch, Harvey shakes his head.

Joyce folds her arm.

INT. HARVEY'S BEDROOM - 1980'S - DAY

HARVEY and JOYCE lay there quietly, both exhausted. Joyce

turns over so her back faces Harvey. He puts his arm around

her.

ANGLE ON JOYCE'S FACE

A tear drips down her cheek.

INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - 1980'S - DAY

Joyce is straightening up the apartment. The place actually

looks halfway decent.

THE DOORBELL RINGS

Joyce opens the door. A guy in his 30's named FRED -- Hells

Angels tough guy meets sensitive artist -- stands at the

door. He's accompanied by a seven-year-old girl, DANIELLE.

Joyce leans down and addresses the girl, who holds a toy

horse.

It's immediately obvious that Joyce is great with kids.

They all walk towards the table which is covered with papers.

EXT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - 1980'S - LATER

Miserable and in a daze, HARVEY walks up to his front door.

He looks like a man whose days are numbered. When he reaches

the door, he searches his pockets for keys.

ANGLE ON POCKET

Harvey's hand comes up empty.

Harvey tries the doorknob, but it's locked.

He steps back on the lawn and looks around. Could he have

dropped them? He retraces a few steps.

Harvey yells up at the window.

ANGLE ON FRONT DOOR

HARVEY'S ELDERLY NEIGHBOR struggles with her shopping cart

through the door.

Harvey pushes past her to get in.

INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT VESTIBULE

Harvey knocks again. Nothing. Now he punches the door.

Suddenly the door opens. Loud music pours out. But it's not

Joyce, it's FRED, the artist.

Harvey just stares at him. Fred opens the door to reveal:

JOYCE and DANIELLE dancing together with the stereo blasting.

They're having a ball.

INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - 1980'S - DAY

At the kitchen table, HARVEY looks over FRED'S sketches.

JOYCE and DANIELLE are now building a house of cards on the

living room floor.

Harvey looks away at Joyce and Danielle playing. They're

oblivious to the world.

CLOSE UP: A PENCIL SKETCHING

FRED'S PENCIL completes a sketch of Joyce pushing Harvey in

a wheelchair. The word "cancer" appears everywhere, floating

all around the image.

COMIC ART / REAL LIFE MONTAGE

The following montage chronicles Harvey's illness by cutting

between comic art depicting key events and shots of HARVEY,

JOYCE and FRED creating the book.

The montage is set to the simultaneously dulcet and discordant

tone of Miles Davis' "Blue in Green" (or something similar).

INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - 1980'S - DAY

Close on Harvey's face as he's getting pushed down the hall

in a wheelchair.

M.R.I. COMIC PANEL

A panel of Harvey entering the M.R.I. machine.

INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - 1980'S - DAY

We see Harvey, Joyce and Fred sitting around a table. Joyce

fights to keep Harvey focused on the project.

BACK TO MORE COMIC PANELS:

1) An enraged Harvey throws things around the house.

2) Joyce on the bed crying, a cat licking her back.

INT. HARVEY'S SHOWER - 1980'S - DAY

A balding Harvey depressed in the shower. He holds a clump

of hair in his hand.

COMIC PANEL OF THE ABOVE SCENE

Harvey in the shower. The balloon above his head reveals his

inner turmoil over losing his hair and his face swelling.

MORE COMIC PANELS FOLLOW

Harvey in agony. Various positions of him in bed, on all

fours, covered with a case of shingles. "I feel like I'm on

fire" appears over his head.

INT. HARVEY'S KITCHEN - 1980'S - DAY

Joyce and Fred go over some more comic art. Joyce carries

the idea over to Harvey (wearing a baseball cap), who can't

get out of the couch. He looks it over and nods. Danielle

brings Harvey a glass of water.

MORE COMIC PANELS:

Harvey crawling up the steps. "I'm so weak I can't make it,"

he thinks...

Harvey and Joyce in a hospital waiting room. He's slumped

over, she has her hand on him.

A delirious Harvey surrounded by nurses and Joyce. "She's

torturing me, she won't let me die, I wanna die..."

INT. HARVEY'S BATHROOM - 1980'S - DAY

A balding Harvey lies on his bathroom floor. His cat walks

all over him.

MORE COMIC PANELS:

Joyce attempts to wake Harvey up. She curses at him. She

slaps him. "Why are you doing this to me!"

A drawing of Joyce, doubled over, crying. "I can't take this

anymore..."

THE MONTAGE ENDS WITH A SCENE IN HARVEY'S BEDROOM

INT. HARVEY'S BEDROOM - 1980'S - NIGHT

A repeat of the opening scene... Like a ghost, a naked HARVEY

stands over his bed staring down at a sleeping JOYCE.

In the eerie light, he's almost translucent.

Joyce springs up, alarmed.

Harvey just stands there for a moment saying nothing.

Joyce just stares at him, unsure how to answer. Finally Harvey

collapses.

Joyce leaps from the bed, nervous, hysterical. She gets down

on the floor and shakes him.

CLOSE ON HARVEY'S FACE

His eyes remain closed, his expression far, far away. The

sound of Joyce's voice fades until it seems like a distant

echo.

Then PANELS from Harvey's comics begin to float over his

head, his life literally passing before his eyes in comic

book form.

Slowly, the comic images and the unconscious Harvey evaporate,

giving way to:

GREEN SCREEN

A SURREAL DREAM SEQUENCE

We are now in a large, empty room similar to a blank comic

book panel.

A healthy, fully dressed Harvey appears in the corner of the

frame. He is very far away, barely recognizable. We slowly

dolly towards him as he delivers a formal soliloquy to the

camera:

As Harvey speaks, one-dimensional comic book images from his

life pass over the screen once again. This time in front of

him, behind him, everywhere. We dolly in towards him.

Images of Harvey's childhood float by, followed by his young

adult years.

We see Harvey age in the images: he's hanging on the street

corner with friends, collecting records, hanging with Crumb.

Now, numerous images of Harvey's many years at the V.A.

Hospital float by: Harvey filing, Harvey arguing with his

boss, Harvey and Toby, etc.

The comic images fade out. Harvey is once again alone in the

empty room.

We slowly move in on his face. Extremely close. As close as

the camera can get.

END DREAM SEQUENCE

INT. HARVEY'S BEDROOM - 1980'S - DAY

BACK TO BEDROOM:

We are close on HARVEY'S face as he lays passed out and

delirious on the floor. Over this WE HEAR...

His face slowly fades to black.

A MOMENT OF BLACK, AND THEN...

INT. TOWER BOOKS - 1980'S - DAY

FADE IN:

CLOSE UP: A GLOSSY, FULL-COLOR, NOVEL-SIZED COMIC COVER.

Scrawled across the top in yellow and red it read, "Our Cancer

Year." The drawing depicts Harvey doubled over on the front

lawn, groceries in the snow, with Joyce attempting to help

him up. A hand flips the book open and signs the inside leaf.

JOYCE and a healthy-looking HARVEY sit at a table signing

copies of their opus. About fifteen or so people mill about

with copies.

INT. HARVEY'S LIVING ROOM - 1980'S - DAY

The place is still a mess but somehow it has a better vibe

than it had before. This might be due to the presence of

DANIELLE. She sits crossed legged on the floor making jewelry

out of beads. JOYCE guides her.

HARVEY shuffles into the room. He watches for a moment as

Joyce and Danielle play.

ANGLE ON JOYCE: There is an awkward expression almost

resembling a smile on her face. He interrupts them.

Joyce looks up. Harvey looks like he's trying to hide

something.

Joyce stops what she's doing and gulps. She hangs on Harvey's

every word.

Tears well in Harvey's eyes. Joyce breathes a sigh of relief

and Danielle jumps up and runs over to Harvey. She hugs him.

INT. CLEVELAND ICE RINK - 1980 - DAY

HARVEY sits in the bleachers, watching JOYCE teach DANIELLE

to ice skate.

Harvey's got a box of pizza next to him. He picks up a slice

and chomps on it. The cheese drips out of his mouth onto his

INT. HARVEY'S APARTMENT - 1980'S - DAY

HARVEY and DANIELLE lie on the futon together. Harvey's comics

are strewn around the room everywhere. Danielle flips through

one.

Danielle makes a face.

EXT. SCHOOL BUS STOP - FALL - PRESENT - DAY

HARVEY walks towards the bus stop to send DANIELLE to school.

He holds her hand.

Danielle looks up at Harvey like he's crazy.

Danielle drops his hand and rushes onto the bus with other

kids.

Harvey waves and watches as it pulls away.

He turns and walks by himself down the busy Cleveland street --

-- a familiar image from the opening. He's still hunched

over. He's still Harvey.

DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE -- SHOT ON FILM

NOW THE REAL HARVEY walks down the same busy Cleveland street

towards his job.

INT. V.A. HOSPITAL - PRESENT - DAY

DOCUMENTARY FOOTAGE -- SHOT ON FILM

THE REAL HARVEY slumps at the desk now, flipping through a

comic book.

ANGLE ON DOOR

THE REAL TOBY comes into the file room, carrying a cake with

sparklers. He's followed by a group of Harvey's REAL COWORKERS

and JOYCE and REAL DANIELLE.

Harvey moves the comic off his desk so Toby can put the cake

down.

ANGLE ON CAKE

The festive cake reads "HAPPY RETIREMENT HARVEY." REAL JOYCE

cuts the cake and passes slices to the group.

ANOTHER WORKER pops a bottle of champagne.

CLOSE on a glass of champagne getting filled. The glass sits

next to the comic Harvey was reading.

CLOSE UP ON COMIC BOOK COVER

HARVEY'S new edition of AMERICAN SPLENDOR is subtitled, "OUR

MOVIE YEAR." It features an illustration of HARVEY, JOYCE

and DANIELLE surrounded by cameras, lights and crew.
