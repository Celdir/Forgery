FADE IN:

INT. HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM. DAY.

A college counselor stands at the Podium lecturing the high

school seniors about their future.

There is some rustling in the audience.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL. HEALTH CLASS.

A different teacher lectures a different class of students.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL. SCIENCE CLASS.

Same angle. Different teacher.

REVERSE ANGLE. STUDENTS.

They stare back in stunned silence. One of them, DAVID

WAGNER, sits in the front row with a pencil in his mouth.

Nobody moves ...

1958.

Birds are chirping. The sun is shining. All the hedges are

neatly pruned and the lawns are perfectly manicured. A sweet

stillness hangs over the SUBURBAN STREET, which is bathed in

beautiful BLACK AND WHITE.

SUBURBAN HOME.

GEORGE PARKER enters the front door and hangs his hat on the

coatrack. He sets his briefcase down and moves into the foyer

with a huge smile on his face. It's a frozen smile that

doesn't seem to be affected by too much in particular--like a

tour guide at Disneyland.

WIDER.

MRS. GEORGE PARKER (BETTY) enters, untying the back of her

apron. She is a vision of '50s beauty with a thin figure and

concrete hair. Betty crosses to her husband and hands him a

fresh martini. She kisses him on the cheek.

WAGNER LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.

1996 -- (LIVING COLOR)

DAVID WAGNER sits on his couch watching this entire action on

a sleek new Sony T.V. He stares riveted at the set with a big

smile on his face. David wears black shoes, black pants,

black t-shirt and a black baseball cap, not a nerd exactly

... He reaches next to him into a huge bag of Doritos, never

taking his eyes off the show.

He leans over and kisses her--again on the cheek.

There is a loud and inappropriate LAUGH TRACK. David smiles

wider and is just about to reach for more corn chips, when

his real MOTHER'S VOICE rings out from the other room.

INT. KITCHEN.

David's mom paces the room with the phone in her hand.

Between the plastic surgery and the make-up it's hard to fix

her age.

INT. LIVING ROOM.

Her words drift in from the kitchen while David stares at the

show.

He reaches out and TURNS UP THE SOUND. PLEASANTVILLE plays at

an unnaturally high volume.

RESUME T.V. (BLACK AND WHITE)

The Parkers' son and daughter (BUD AND MARY SUE) enter the

foyer together. Mary Sue wears her hair in a pony tail. Bud

has on a Letterman's sweater.

Bud hesitates for a moment, then folds up a shiny blue

ribbon.

There is another jarring LAUGH TRACK.

CLOSE UP. DAVID.

He smiles right along with it. David stares transfixed at the

set despite the continuing conversation in the other room.

CLOSE UP. DAVID.

He grabs another handful of Doritos staring at the T.V ...

EXT. HIGH SCHOOL. (SERIES OF SHOTS) DAY.

A cacophony of modem life. Beepers and nose rings--blue hair

and tattoos. Dissonant boom boxes compete with one another.

The hormones are running crazy.

SCHOOL COURTYARD.

lt is a large open area, alive at lunchtime. Groups of kids

hang out together, divided by their various cliques. The

music pounds in the background.

CLOSE UP. DAVID.

He stands at one end of the courtyard beside a chain link

fence. Beads of sweat form on David's forehead as he speaks

to someone in front of him.

REVERSE ANGLE.

A very pretty blonde girl smiles back at him. It's a warm,

welcoming smile.

CLOSE UP. DAVID.

REVERSE ANGLE. GIRL.

She smiles wider at him, inviting him to continue.

CLOSE UP. DAVID.

REVERSE ANGLE. GIRL.

She nods at him ...

CLOSE UP. DAVID.

REVERSE ANGLE. GIRL.

She positively beams. The girl flicks her blonde hair and

stares back at him adoringly.

CLOSE UP. DAVID.

Instead of smiling back, David just stares, then looks at the

ground.

WIDE ANGLE. SCHOOLYARD.

For the first time WE SEE THAT SHE WASN'T TALKING TO HIM.

David stands a good hundred yards across the schoolyard,

rehearsing this speech while the young woman stands face to

face with a much cooler boy. He has a cell phone and a very

hip haircut.

ANGLE. DAVID.

David watches as the girl throws her arm around the boy's

waist and heads out of the playground ...

EXT. "LUNCHEON COURT". DAY.

David and his friends are all gathered around the plastic

picnic tables and vending machines that form the luncheon

court. The chess club meets at one end and there are some

teachers at the other. All the cool kids are on the other

side of the fence but David and his friends eat lunch at the

same table every day.

Howard looks at him, puzzled.

They all nod--and murmur with admiration.

Everybody thinks.

Nobody knows.

It's quiet for a beat.

THE OTHER SIDE OF THE FENCE.

David's sister, Jennifer, hangs out with her friends in the

parking lot. All the girls are dressed in the exact same

uniform: Blue jeans, beeper on the belt, white V-neck T

shirt, car keys in their hand. (Even the girls WITHOUT a car

hold car keys in their hand). Jennifer is by far the

prettiest and, thus, is the leader of the group. They all

look toward the Luncheon Court where David and his friends

are hanging out.

A group of VERY HIP boys strut through the parking lot. They

bop up and down with the self-confidence of all cool sixteen

year olds. The girls freeze when they see them.

DIFFERENT ANGLE.

He pauses then looks over at her. Jennifer slides sinuously

off the fender of the car, flicking her hair like a young

racehorse. She has a perfect 16 year old body and the whole

parking lot knows it. Mark heads over to her, followed by his

lackies. The two groups meet at the tail-gate of the Nissan

Pathfinder like a small summit conference.

Beat ...

Everyone nods for a moment or two. No one says anything.

Jennifer pauses, weighing the next statement.

Kimmy and Christin positively GASP while Mark's Lackeys

mumble and glance around. The import of the thing isn't lost

on anybody. Mark bobs up and down a little faster.

Everybody bobs and shuffles for  beat, when Mark nods,

summoning his flock.

EXT. WAGNER HOUSE. DUSK.

lt is a south-westem version of "Leave it to Beaver." The

uniformity of Suburbia has been washed in earth tones. There

is a red tile roof gracing every home. All the houses have

the same anemic palm tree. It's a urban planner's version of

hell.

INT. WAGNER HOME.

lt is just as sleek and impersonal as before. Maybe more so

at night. Jennifer crosses through the living room with the

cordless phone attached to her ear.

INT. DAVID'S BEDROOM.

lt is studious and academic--not joyless, but not colorful

either. David stands at his bedroom window, staring outside

with a cordless phone in his hand.

REVERSE ANGLE. HIS POV.

His mother loads the final Louis Vuitton bag into her

Mercedes.

She fires up the car and pulls out of the driveway...

INT. WAGNER LIVING ROOM.

The huge black TV sits like a monolith in the middle of the

room. All at once David comes bounding down the stairs making

a B-Iine for the couch. Jennifer enters just as quickly from

the other direction, fiddling with her clothes.

DIFFERENT ANGLE.

They hit the coffee table and reach for the remote control at

exactly the same moment. Both of them freeze then look up at

each other in shock.

Neither one moves. They clutch the remote together.

Jennifer gets panicked and yanks at the remote. David yanks

back and before they know it, the remote goes flying out of

their hands, CRASHING onto the hardwood floor. lt smashes

into a million tiny pieces.

David cradles the pieces like a fallen comrade, when the

DOORBELL RINGS behind him.

Jennifer sweeps some of the pieces frantically under the sofa

and tries to adjust her outfit on the way to the door. David

just stares in shock at the shattered plastic. Jennifer

reaches the front door and wets her lips. She fluffs her hair

quickly, sticks out her chest then swings it open.

DIFFERENT ANGLE. FRONT DOOR.

Jennifer steps forward with her sexiest smile, but it isn't

Mark Davis on the other side. DICK VAN DYKE STANDS ACROSS THE

THRESHOLD IN A TV REPAIRMAN'S OUTFIT. Jennifer looks at him

puzzled. He steps forward, flashing her a chipper grin,

toolbox in hand.

REVERSE ANGLE. DAVID'S POV.

He glances out the front door toward a weird VAN parked at

the curb. It says TV REPAIR on the side but looks like

something from a medicine show. The antenna on top resembles

a weather vane and the mural beneath it depicts a happy

family from the 1950s, gathered around their TV set. Everyone

wears a smile, including the dog. The hand-painted motto

reads "Rob's TV Repair--WE'LL FIX YOU FOR GOOD."

INT. LIVING ROOM.

David looks back at Dick Van Dyke who smiles at him, then

crosses to the living room STEPPING NIMBLY AROUND THE

OTTOMAN. He heads toward the TV.

He pops the top of the tool box while Jennifer and David just

stare. It's a strange looking box with the same happy family

painted on the side. Dick Van Dyke pulls out another remote.

Jennifer shuts the door and crosses down toward the living

room.

At that moment there is a huge FORK OF LIGHTNING and a

booming CLAP OF THUNDER. It literally rattles the walls of

the house as Dick Van Dyke turns toward David.

David recoils slightly. Dick Van Dyke flashes him a smile.

He stares at David, speechless, for a moment, then smiles

fondly and reaches beside him for his tool kit.

CLOSER.

He flashes them a big smile and holds out a weird looking

contraption that seems more primitive than space age. It's a

strange combination of an early transistor radio and Flash

Gordon ray gun. Dick Van Dyke extends it with pride, while

Jennifer and David stare at him warily ...

There is a SECOND CLAP OF THUNDER even louder than the first.

The house rattles for a moment then is quiet.

He places the remote control gingerly on the coffee table and

smiles at them. Dick starts across the living room when he

suddenly catches his foot on the leg of the ottoman and

tumbles end over end. He rolls on the carpet, executes a

perfect somersault and comes right back to a standing

position. David and Jennifer stare at him stunned when he

looks back at them and smiles.

There is another flash of lightning as he reaches for the

doorknob. David and Jennifer look at one another while the

front door shuts with a THUD. It's quiet for a second or two

before there is another CLAP OF THUNDER. David cocks his

head.

DIFFERENT ANGLE.

David glances down at the strange contraption sitting on the

coffee table. It looks a little scary. Slowly, very slowy, he

reaches down and touches it. Nothing seems to happen so he

picks it up.

CLOSER.

David points the remote toward the TV set with an

apprehensive look on his face. He winces a little, then

pushes one of the buttons.

DIFFERENT ANGLE.

The TV set turns on. Oprah's face fills the screen as an

angry housewife screams at a transvestite!

It ail seems normal as he pushes another button. This time

the channel changes.

He continues to press the button, flipping through the

channels. Jennifer sees that everything is fine and reaches

for the remote.

He continues to flip through the channels, coming to rest on

the Pleasantville Marathon.

BUD'S VOICE fills the room.

FULL SHOT. TV SET. "PLEASANTVILLE" (BLACK AND WHITE)

Bud and Mary Sue clutch either end of a small transistor

radio. They seem to be in the EXACT SAME POSITION as David

and Jennifer, who are struggling over the remote control.

ANGLE. DAVID AND JENNIFER.

She tugs the remote while David yanks in the other direction.

WIDER. LIVING ROOM.

She tugs at the remote trying to wrestle it out of his hands.

David pulls in the opposite direction as they POINT IT

DIRECTLY TOWARD THE TV.

DIFFERENT ANGLE. SPECIAL EFFECT.

A huge white light emanates from the contraption, like their

own atomic blast wave. The entire room is filled with a

BLINDING AURA for a second or two, before it actually gets

sucked into the TV.

WIDE ANGLE. LIVING ROOM.

It is suddenly empty--illuminated only by the soft glow of

the picture tube. David and Jennifer are nowhere in sight.

INT. PARKER LIVING ROOM. (PLEASANTVILLE) DAY.

David and Jennifer are standing in the middle of the 1950's

living room, dressed in Bud and Mary Sue's clothing. They

still clutch the remote control in the exact same position

that was occupied by their fictional counterparts. David and

Jennifer glance at one another, then look horrified around

the room. THE WORLD HAS TURNED TO BLACK AND WHITE...

WIDER

George Parker (Bud and Mary Sue's father) enters from the

landing whistling a happy tune. He's dressed in a gray suit

with a gray shirt, and a dark gray tie with little gray dots.

He continues to cross through the living room whistling into

the kitchen ...

He glances down at the remote control that sits lifeless in

his hand. David frantically presses the buttons but nothing

happens. All at once, there is a voice behind them.

DIFFERENT ANGLE.

They whirl around to see DICK VAN DYKE'S FACE smiling at them

from the TV set in the comer. It's an old '50s set with a big

round picture tube. They run over to him as he smiles. His

face is the only color in the room.

They stare stunned at the TV set.

David glances around at his black and white surroundings. His

"mother's" voice rings out from the kitchen.

FULL SHOT. TELEVISION SET. (COLOR)

All at once the scene on the TV changes and Dick Van Dyke's

picture gives way to a WIDE ANGLE SHOT of the WAGNER HOUSE.

Mark Davis is standing at the front door, BANGING on the

brass knocker. He checks his watch, shifts restlessly for a

moment or two, then turns and heads down the flagstone walk

never looking back.

INT. PARKER LIVING ROOM. (BLACK AND WHITE AGAIN)

Jennifer flings herself at the screen, as Dick Van Dyke

appears all over again.

A long face slowly descends on him.

David moves toward the screen.

Dick Van Dyke shakes his head and walks out of the shot as

the screen goes completely BLACK. It cuts out entirely as

Jennifer and David just stare. David grabs the remote and

starts rapidly pushing buttons.

Nothing happens.

DIFFERENT ANGLE.

Betty (their "mother") sticks her head into the living room

wearing her black and white apron. She has a great big

Pepsodent smile.

They just stare at her.

They exchange a strange little glance then slowly rise to

their feet. Jennifer waits for David who forces a smile then

starts toward the kitchen.

INT. KITCHEN.

David and Jennifer walk two steps into the kitchen when they

suddenly freeze--agape at the spectacle in front of them:

THEIR POV. PARKER KITCHEN.

Every breakfast food imaginable has been laid upon the table.

There are hotcakes and sausages and biscuits and eggs.

Pitchers of orange juice are dwarfed by the mountains of ham.

The table literally sags under the weight of the food. George

Parker lowers his morning paper and smiles at his children.

They nod, stunned, and wander forward into the room. Bright

sunlight streams through the kitchen window as a gentle

symphony of songbirds sings outside. David and Jennifer stare

straight ahead as their "mother" adds some waffles to the

heap.

David and Jennifer stare at her stunned as she puts two

heaping plates at their places. Neither one moves.

She takes Jennifer by the shoulders and "guides" her into the

chair. Jennifer looks down at a huge plate of GRAY WAFFLES.

Betty drenches the waffles in syrup and slathers on a huge

slab of butter.

Jennifer hesitates then glances over at her "mother" who

looks at her expectantly. She glances at David who just looks

stunned. Jennifer pauses then reaches down and takes a

forkful of the oozing mess ...

FULL SHOT. PAT BOONE.

He stands facing the CAMERA in an actual Kinescope from 1958.

The backdrop is a painted pastoral landscape and the

background singers are all white debutantes. He wears a

letterman's sweater and button down shirt ...

He CONTINUES his homogenized version of Little Richard's

nasty hit, (all the nastiness gone). It becomes a slow and

lilting melody ...

SERIES OF SHOTS. PLEASANTVILLE.

The MUSIC CONTINUES as the CAMERA CUTS TO image after image

of this strange "Utopia." The effect is a weird, sanitizied

version of MTV--as if Ronald Reagan had shot a music video.

There are men tipping their hats and women walking their

dogs; cheery gas station attendants and smiling policemen.

Pruned hedges. Twin beds. BIG houses. The CAMERA CRANES DOWN

in the middle of a beautiful tree lined street to find David

and Jennifer walking up the sidewalk, holding their stomachs.

Jennifer clutches her stomach, but David's glance darts from

side to side--totally absorbed.

A man calls out from across the street.

Jen looks around this cheery little street, and the horror

starts to dawn on her. At that moment, they hear a screaming

SIREN and a bright GRAY FIRE ENGINE comes racing up the

block.

WIDER.

Jennifer and David step back on the curb as the firemen come

flying out of the truck, grabbing the ladder on the back.

DIFFERENT ANGLE. (FOLLOWING THE FIREMEN)

They work in perfect precision. Two firemen grab the base of

the ladder while a third takes the front. They go tearing

across one of the lawns, in full "emergency response"

anchoring the ladder into the ground and winging it up into a

tree.

He emerges a moment later with the cat who was stuck in the

tree. Jennifer sinks to the curb as he carries the kitten by

them, petting it gently as he goes.

Jennifer turns to see a strapping blonde seventeen year old

driving by in his convertible. He is extremely handsome with

Jack Armstrong features and a Letterman's sweater. Despite

her crisis, Jennifer's jaw drops open as he slows to a crawl.

Biff Martin flashes a huge Pepsodent smile. The guy is a

"dreamboat".

Biff turns to see the fireman climb into the truck, with the

kitty in his arms.

He takes off down the street with the sun glinting on his

really keen convertible. Jennifer gapes as he disappears

around the corner.

EXT. PLEASANTVILLE HIGH SCHOOL. DAY.

Streams of impeccably kept youngsters file through the double

doors. All cheery and very pleasant looking. It looks like a

Leni Riefenstahl movie.

ANGLE. FROM ACROSS THE STREET.

David stands beside Jennifer looking at the entrance to the

school. Three girls huddle together by the front steps.

She flicks her hair back--cops a first day of school

attitude, and heads across the street like she owns the

place.

INT. GEOGRAPHY CLASS. LATER ...

It looks like a propaganda film from the Eisenhower

Administration. The boys all wear crew cuts and short sleeve

button down shirts. The girls all have lacy dresses buttoned

to the neck. Everyone stares straight ahead at the

blackboard.

ANGLE. FRONT OF THE ROOM. TEACHER.

Miss Peters stands in front of the class with a pointer in

her hand. She indicates a diagram that spans the length of

the blackboard.

Jennifer looks stunned as several students nod.

ANGLE. JENNIFER.

She glances around at several students who seem to be nodding

in agreement. All at once, she thrusts her hand into the air.

The teacher looks at her with a puzzled frozen smile on her

face. She looks vaguely troubled.

The class lets out a knowing groan--as if to say "Oh. We get

it now. Boy what a stupid question." Miss Peters gives a kind

but condescending look.

Miss Peters gives a big grin as a series of heads nod up and

down. Jennifer stares straight ahead, dumbfounded ...

INT. GYMNASIUM. DAY.

There are fifteen to twenty boys scattered around the Gym.

Each is dressed identically in white shorts and black socks

with a "PLEASANTVILLE" jersey.

SHOT. DAVID.

He stands at the free throw line with a basketball in his

hand. (Not exactly an athletic image.) David lets go of a

jump shot that swishes effortlessly through the net. He looks

a little surprised.

He stares at the backboard slightly intrigued. David

retrieves the ball and fires again, this time chucking it

up blind. The ball sails through the hoop again, HITTING

NOTHING BUT NET.

FULL SHOT. OTHER SIDE OF THE GYM.

Ten to twelve of his teammates fire simultaneously at the

hoop. ALL OF THE SHOTS SAIL THROUGH THE HOOP, NONE EVEN

NICKING THE RIM. The boys retrieve their shots as the coach

claps his hands.

ANGLE. DAVID.

He gets the ball and turns his back on the basket completely.

David flings the ball wildly over his shoulder. It bounces

off all the walls of the gym, then glides through the net as

smoothly as the others. He stares in amazement.

WIDER.

Biff Martin (the boy in the convertible) approaches from the

other side of the Gym. He is a classic All American Hero--

somewhere between 4-H club member and a future astronaut.

He fidgets nervously for a moment looking down.

Biff's expression falls. He stands crushed in front of David.

All at once, Biff takes the basketball he's been holding and

hurls it toward the hoop. The ball does a couple of

revolutions of the rim, and then amazingly pops out.

WIDE ANGLE. GYM.

Play comes to a halt. ALL THE PLAYERS TURN AND STARE,

DUMBSTRUCK AT THE SIGHT OF A MISSED SHOT.

SHOT. DAVID.

He retrieves the ball quickly then hurries back to Biff.

David pulls him aside as play slowly resumes on the other

side of the gym.

Biff looks at him, troubled.

Biff nods, a little confused, as David pats him on the back.

INT. CORRIDOR. LATER ...

David stands off to the side with his sister, while class

pours out around them.

She reaches into her purse and pulls out a book of matches.

Jennifer tries to light a Kleenex on fire.

Sure enough the tissue has become flame retardant.

She looks over at him, slowly.

At that moment, three of Mary Sue's "friends" come tittering

around the comer. They skitter up to her like a group of

wind-up toys.

They explode in a torrent of TITTERS all over again. Jennifer

looks over at David.

EXT. PARKER HOUSE. DUSK.

A lone streetlamp glows in the foreground. Jennifer's voice

plays OS.

INT. MARY SUE'S ROOM.

Jennifer emerges from the closet in a mohair sweater and a

poodle skirt. Under the sweater she wears a 1950's "bullet

bra" that turn her breasts into lethal weapons.

EXT. SODA SHOP. DUSK.

The flashing neon ice cream cone looks good enough to drink.

Underneath it, the swirling script spells "SODA SHOP". Johnny

Mathis drifts out into the evening air ...

CLOSER.

David comes sprinting up to the screen door and pauses to get

his breath. He adjusts a little soda jerk's hat, then plunges

inside.

INT. SODA SHOP.

Mr. Johnson, the owner and proprietor is wiping down the

counter. He is a "pleasant" looking man, in his early forties

wearing a white apron and black glasses. The strains of

"MISTY" get louder as Bud lets the screen door slam behind

him.

He stops wiping for a moment, holding the towel in his hand.

He stares at the rag a little troubled.

He looks down at the towel clearly disturbed. David pauses

for a moment then starts toward him.

He crosses to Mr. Johnson who has polished one section of the

counter right down to the wood. David takes the towel out of

his hand and folds it neatly in front of him.

EXT. PARKER HOUSE. NIGHT.

Biff's convertible rolls up to the curb with Pat Boone

playing on the radio. He runs a comb through his short blonde

hair before grabbing the bouquet of flowers next to him and

heading up the walk. Biff rings the doorbell and, a moment

later, Jennifer's silhouette appears in the doorway ...

EXT. SODA SHOP. NIGHT.

The place is really hopping now. All the spots in the parking

lot are filled with vintage "jalopies" and several patrons

are streaming through the door. The SAME JOHNNY MATHIS SONG

is still PLAYING on the juke box, and the neon ice cream soda

sign blinks against the sky.

INT. SODA SHOP.

David is trapped behind the counter, furiously working to

keep up with the load. Several clean cut teenagers pepper him

with orders while he yanks at the pumps and spiggots. It's

clear he isn't used to this.

David nods quickly, wiping some sweat from his brow. He

scoops some ice cream into the metal blender as Mr. Johnson

comes up beside him.

Mr. Johnson recoils slightly.

Mr. Johnson stares at him.

DIFFERENT ANGLE. SODA SHOP ENTRANCE.

The screen door swings open and is held there by the end of a

Letterman's sweater. A moment later, Jennifer sashays

through, parading her new Jane Russell profile. Her

"girlfriends" TITTER from the comer as Biff rushes up to a

table, and pulls out a chair. She sashays into it, brushing

against him as she goes.

ANGLE. DAVID.

He stares motionless at the spectacle--concerned and

apprehensive. David holds a hot fudge sundae under the soda

spiggot and jerks back on the lever blowing ice cream all

over his chest.

FULL SHOT. TABLE.

Biff stares across the table at Jennifer with the wholesome

devotion of a labrador retriever. He looks like a cross

between Troy Donahue and a mannequin.

He guffaws for a moment or two before speaking again.

WIDER.

He stands at their table holding a little white pad of paper

and a pencil. Jennifer looks up at her brother and almost

bursts out laughing. He wears his soda jerk hat at a jaunty

angle with large white apron tied around his neck.

More goony laughs. David turns to Jennifer who puts on the

same dopey countenance.

He shoots her a dirty look. Jennifer just smiles at him.

ANGLE. FOLLOWING DAVID.

He glowers at her all the way back to the counter. David

posts the order in the little carousel clip board, keeping an

eye on the table the entire time ...

RESUME. TABLE.

Biff gazes across the table at Jennifer with an adoring look

on his face. His hands are properly folded in front of him.

She's still trying to do her best "Mary Sue."

There is some TITTERING behind her. Jennifer doesn't respond.

He still doesn't understand. Biff GUFFAWS for a moment or two

then glances down at the table top. There is a momentary

break in the Music as Johnny Mathis' "MISTY" starts up all

over again. It's enough to make you shoot yourself.

Jennifer gets up in a daze and heads toward the bathroom.

ANGLE. DAVID.

He freezes behind the counter and watches as his sister

practically stumbles through the bathroom door.

INT. BATHROOM.

Of course there aren't any toilets. Jennifer gropes her way

to the sink and leans against the counter.

She turns and sits against the sink for a moment with a

dumbstruck look on her face. Jennifer shakes her head for a

moment or two, when the door to the bathroom bursts open.

They TITTER away, even though they don't get it either. It

sounds like an aviary.

They TITTER some more as Jennifer shakes her head.

INT. SODA SHOP.

David is standing beside their table as she retums from the

bathroom.

She flashes him a "sweet" smile then reaches out and TOUCHES

BIFF'S HAND. Both boys jump slightly as Jennifer gives her

brother a venomous grin then suddenly waves "bye bye." David

just stares at her panicked as he moves haltingly back to the

Soda fountain.

There is an audible GASP from the booth behind them. Jennifer

ignores it.

CLOSE UP. BIFF.

He just stares at her with his mouth open ...

WIDER.

Jennifer reaches forward grabbing his hand.

FULL SHOT. SODA FOUNTAIN.

David is in the middle of making a hot fudge sundae when he

sees Jennifer leading Biff by the hand into the parking lot.

Everyone at the counter is enjoying their dessert, when David

lets out a blood curdling scream.

He vaults over the counter making a bee-line for the door.

Everyone turns and stares as he races toward the entrance ...

EXT. SODA SHOP.

Biff's car is just pulling onto the street when David sprints

into the parking lot. He takes off after the car, sprinting

down the street.

The tail lights recede in the distance as David slows to a

jog and then finally a walk. He pauses, winded, in the

street, then looks up toward Heaven with a pissed off look on

his face.

EXT. LOVER'S LANE. NIGHT.

It is a beautiful tree-lined pond with a lush willow tree in

the foreground. The moonlight glistens silver across the

water. Several cars are parked in a row with their occupants

HOLDING HANDS. Biff's convertible is parked at the end.

SHOT. BIFF'S CAR.

He sits stiffly at the wheel staring straight ahead. Jennifer

is draped languidly across the seat beside him, making the

most of her mohair sweater. She stares at Biff in a not-so-

Pleasantville-kind-of-way. He glances over at her and

swallows.

She leans back a liftle more, draping her arm across the top

of the seat. Her tits point toward the sky.

He looks over at her a little confused, then breaks into his

goony laugh.

CLOSE UP. BIFF.

He is still guffawing when he looks over at Jennifer and

suddenly freezes. Biff's eyes widen ...

EXT. PARKER HOUSE. NIGHT.

David comes sprinting up to the porch, then doubles over

catching his breath. He clings onto the porch swing when the

door opens behind him.

WIDER.

His "mother" and "father" come out onto the porch. David

catches his breath then forces a smile.

His mother and father exchange a "knowing" look. George rests

a hand on his shoulder.

EXT. LOVER'S LANE. NIGHT.

The low gutteral MOANS of two coupling animals drifts out

over the evening air. It is raw and primitive and desperate.

The CAMERA begins to TRACK behind all the other cars--their

occupants primly holding hands in a tender sillouhette. It

finally COMES TO REST on a convertible at the end, with a

girl's leg sticking out the window.

CLOSER.

A Letterman's sweater hangs over the door. The windshield is

completely fogged. Jennifer's sweater is draped over the

backseat. The car is rocking.

INT. CAR.

They are clenched in a mad embrace: all arms and hair. Biff

pulls back for a moment, GASPING for air. His face is covered

with lipstick and there is a crazy look in his eye. He's

stuck somewhere between passion and fear as he clings

desperately to the steering wheel.

She holds onto his shirt as her knee rubs the dashboard.

He glances down at his lap a little confused.

He looks at his crotch then back at Jennifer. She reaches up

and grabs a handful of his hair.

He looks at her completely confused as she pulls back down,

and OUT OF FRAME ...

EXT. PARKER HOUSE. NIGHT.

A single light is burning in the kitchen window.

INT. KITCHEN.

David is at the kitchen table with a nauseated look on his

face. There are three empty bottles of milk and cookie crumbs

all over the table.

There is a knock behind them at the door. David springs up.

FOLLOWING DAVID.

He crosses into the foyer ahead of his "parents." David

swings open the door revealing Mr. Johnson, standing on the

porch.

Mr. Johnson leans in closer and speaks in a CONFIDENTIAL tone

of voice.

CLOSER.

Mr. Johnson has a strange look of "manly pride" on his face.

His shoulders square back. His chest puffs out a little.

There is a sudden sparkle in his eye.

He looks at David with pride then suddenly shifts his glance

behind him.

Neither one says anything but neither one has to. David looks

on in horror as his mother locks eyes with Mr. Johnson and

his new found virility.

He turns and starts hustling him down the walk just as Biff's

convertible pulls up at the curb.

INT. CAR. CLOSE UP. JENNIFER.

She looks sweetly over at the driver's side of the car (OUT

OF FRAME).

ANGLE. BIFF. OTHER SIDE OF CAR.

He sits behind the wheel with a totally dazed look on his

face. Biff stares stunned at Jennifer, like he just got hit

with a couple of thousand volts.

She leans over and kisses him on the cheek ... Then she bites

his ear lobe, gently, and flashes him a big smile. Biff

smiles back.

EXT. CAR.

She climbs out and shuts the door. Jennifer nods to Mr.

Johnson as she heads up the walk.

She is wearing a big smile by the time she reaches the porch.

David grabs her arm.

She starts up the staircase. David follows her and the CAMERA

follows them both.

She reaches the top of the stairs and turns to him.

She flashes her brother an evil grin.

She shuts the door softly in his face. David stairs at the

gray wood in front of him.

EXT. ELM STREET. NIGHT.

Biff pulls up at an intersection with the same dazed look in

his eye. The car rumbles at the stoplight for a moment or

two, before he glances over to his right.

CLOSE UP. BIFF.

The stunned look turns to one of sheer amazement:

BIFF'S POV. ROSE.

There, against a gray picket fence, on a black and white

street in a black and white neighborhood, A SINGLE RED ROSE

IS BLOOMING.

AERIAL SHOT. PLEASANTVILLE. MORNING

It would be a stunning vista if it wasn't in black and white.

The church steeple gleams in the sunlight. The perfect little

houses look like a row of pretty toys ...

INT. PARKER LIVING ROOM. DAY.

David sits parked in front of the TV furtively turning

through the channels. He flips the dial frantically. No sign

of Dick Van Dyke.

He gives her a sheepish grin and sighs ...

INT. SCHOOL GYM. DAY.

It is the same configuration as earlier. Everyone wears their

Pleasantville "Lions" jerseys, white sneakers and black

socks. David enters the Gym a little groggy. He hasn't had

much sleep.

CLOSER.

He looks up and stops. David cocks his head to the side,

staring across the gym.

HIS POV. BIFF AND OTHER BOYS.

They are huddled at the far end, each holding a basketball

under his arm. Biff is in the center of the group, animatedly

describing something that is holding their RAPT ATTENTION.

WIDER ANGLE. INCLUDING DAVID.

Biff continues his story while they stare at him with their

mouths open. The Coach blows his whistle.

The huddle breaks up as the basketball players all wander

toward the hoop. Ten shots go up at once but NOT ONE COMES

EVEN CLOSE. Several clang off the rim, a couple hit the edge

of the backboard. One slams into the side of the gym.

Everyone stares in disbelief.

INT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR. DAY.

David stands face to face with his sister in mid

conversation.

Jennifer smiles at her friend as she goes by.

David recoils slightly.

Jennifer motions behind her to a boy and girt who are locked

in an intimate conversation. The girl wears bobby socks and

the boy wears a letterman's sweater, but the conversation is

sexually charged. They speak to one another in a close

whisper--their faces inches apart. All at once the girt gets

shy and glances away. She blows a big bubble with her gum,

but the BUBBLE IS BRIGHT PINK IN AN OTHERWISE GRAY FRAME.

CLOSE. DAVID AND JENNIFER.

He looks over in shock as she sucks the BRIGHTLY COLORED

BUBBLE GUM back into her mouth. Jennifer flicks her hair.

EXT. LOVER'S LANE. NIGHT.

It is the exact same shot as before: The CAMERA STARTS ITS

LONG SLOW TRACK behind the vehicles, except this time ALL OF

THEM ARE ROCKING. Various limbs and articles of clothing hang

out the open windows. MOANS of pleasure waft out over Lover's

Lane as the pond glistens in the distance ...

INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE. DAY.

It is a typical '50s family practice right out of Norman

Rockwell. There is a jar of tongue depressors on the counter

and a jar of lollipops beside them. Lisa Anne (Mary Sue's

best friend) is being examined by Dr. Henderson. Her mother

sits at her side.

Lisa Anne opens her mouth and sticks out a BRIGHT RED TONGUE.

Everything else in the frame is Black and White, but her

tongue literally gleams with color.

EXT. LOVER'S LANE. NIGHT.

It is really rocking now. More cars are lined up along the

edge of the lake as the REAL (AND NASTY) VERSION OF TOOTY

FRUITY (BY LITTLE RICHARD) PLAYS OS:

SERIES OF SHOTS. (MONTAGE)

PARKER LIVING ROOM.

TOOTY FRUITY CONTINUES AS DAVID FLIPS FRANTICALLY THROUGH THE

CHANNELS LOOKING FOR DICK VAN DYKE. THERE IS ONLY A PEPSODENT

COMMERCIAL. HE SHAKES HIS HEAD ...

INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYM (MUSIC CONT ...)

The Pleasantville Lions lose a game late in the second half.

The scoreboard reads 84 to 16 ...

INT. PARKER LIVING ROOM. (MUSIC CONT ...)

David examines the back of the TV set ...

INT. FURNITURE STORE. (MUSIC CONT...)

A large group of customers is huddled in a circle, staring at

an item on the display floor, like it is the monolith in

"2001". They seem both confused and absolutely mesmerized as

the CAMERA PUSHES IN TO REVEAL: a double bed ...

INT. PARKER LIVING ROOM. (MUSIC CONT ...)

David sits on the floor with a weird look of resignation as a

Brillcream commercial plays in front of him ...

SODA SHOP. NIGHT. ON DAVID.

He heads toward work with his apron and his paper hat, but

he's clearly disconcerted. David stops and stares at A BRIGHT

RED HOT ROD parked at the front door of the restaurant. He

shakes his head.

SODA SHOP.

The place has been transformed. What was cheery and benign a

couple of days before, has gotten a little bit dangerous. The

letterman sweaters have been replaced by leather jackets. The

Pat Boone and Johnny Mathis have given way to real Rock and

Roll. There is a James Dean/Marlon Brando edge in the air.

Somebody has played the flip side.

ANGLE. DAVID.

He enters the soda shop adjusting his paper hat. A young

couple makes out passionately in the doorway--all tongues and

hands. When they break David sees that the girl's cheeks are

FLUSHED WITH RED. He stares at her for a beat as they return

to normal. David shakes his head.

FOLLOWING HIM.

He crosses to the counter and grabs his pencil and little pad

of paper. Various things have already GONE TO COLOR AROUND

THE ROOM: The JUKE BOX ... The COKE SIGN .. THE NAUGAHIDE

STOOLS ... David crosses to one of the booths where his

sister's arm is draped over Biff's shoulder.

Bud has already written it down. He glances over at his

sister.

Before she can answer he smiles to himself and crosses behind

the counter. Bud posts the order and turns to Mr. Johnson.

CLOSER.

Mr. Johnson. looks up at him with a weird kind of emptiness

in his eyes. David grabs his arm.

He pulls him along the counter toward a little office

storeroom in the back. He yanks him inside and shuts the

door.

INT. STOREROOM.

It is just as cheery as the rest of the place. There is a

small table with a telephone on it. A Texaco calendar shows a

happy family motoring in their Rambler.

Mr. Johnson glances down with a little shame and confusion.

Bud takes a deep breath. He stares at Mr. Johnson, then tries

to speak softly.

This sounds stupid even to David. He shakes his head.

David rolls his eyes. Mr. Johnson leans closer, speaking

furtively.

He pulls a photo album from the back of the desk and opens

it for David.

David looks at him speechless.

INT. BARBERSHOP. DAY

The Barber Pole spins in three shades of gray. Several men

are gathered around the two chairs in the front of Gus' shop.

Besides being the barbershop, it is the bastion of all male

life in Pleasantville. Bud and Mary Sue's "father" (George)

sits in one of the chairs. "Big Bob" McGee, owner of the

drugstore, supermarket and Chevy dealership sits in the

other. He has a crew cut that's getting shorter.

There are several murmurs.

More murmurs, Everyone looks straight ahead trying to figure.

INT. PARKER KITCHEN. DAY.

The women's bridge club has assembled in the Parker kitchen

like it does every Wednesday afternoon. Four women are seated

around the kitchen table with a nice bowl of bridge mix

between them. Betty is sifting next to Marge Jenkins, the

woman who accompanied her daughter to the doctor's office.

SHOT. BETTY.

She looks up quickly--then grabs some bridge mix.

Betty reaches out and grabs her cards. She fans them out in

front of her, when her eyes go wide.

HER POV. BRIDGE HAND.

They are ALL HEARTS and all BRIGHT RED. It looks like a

fistfful of valentines.

CLOSE UP. BETTY.

She puts the cards down quickly and takes a sudden breath.

Betty keeps them like that for a moment or two, before

lifting them up and taking another look.

She swallows trying to keep her composure.

They murmur at the strength of the hand.

EXT. PARKER HOUSE. NIGHT.

The SOUND of the television plays OS while a warm light burns

in the window.

INT. KITCHEN.

Jennifer and Betty stand at the sink finishing the dishes.

Betty washes while Jennifer dries and it's clear who's more

used to this. Jennifer examines a chipped nail as she places

a dish in the drying rack.

Betty hesitates. Rinses out a pot.

She pauses for a long moment.

She stops herself.

Betty nods from the import of the tone but not the meaning. A

beat goes by ...

Jennifer looks over at her stunned, but Betty just looks at

her with a blank, curious expression. Jennifer hesitates.

She crosses to the kitchen door and closes it. The sounds of

the TV in the living room disappear. Jennifer crosses back to

the kitchen counter and turns to her.

Betty looks at her and nods ...

EXT. PARKER HOUSE. NIGHT.

The TV keeps flickering in the window.

INT. KITCHEN. LATER ...

The CAMERA PANS across the kitchen table where there is a

full quart of milk and some uneaten co6kies. It finally comes

to rest on Jennifer who is staring across the kitchen table

with a concerned look on her face.

REVERSE ANGLE. BETTY.

She nods--shaken but "fine." Betty stares long and hard at

the plate of chocolate chip cookies. She's far away.

SHOT. JENNIFER.

She bites her lip weighing her next sentence ...

ANGLE. BETTY.

She looks across the table, perplexed.

INT. PARKER BEDROOM. NIGHT.

George crosses from the dresser to the TWO TWIN BEDS in the

middle of the room. He wears long sleeve pajamas that are

buttoned up to the neck. George puts his glass of warm milk

on the nightstand and climbs in his own single bed. It is

barely wide enough for his body and takes some maneuvering.

There is no answer.

INT. BATHROOM.

She stands in her bathrobe staring down at the tub. Her

dressing gown is buttoned to the neck as well.

CLOSER. BETTY.

She swallows once as she stares down at the tub--then reaches

for the spigot and turns on the water. Betty's heart beats a

little faster as she HEARS the WATER THUNDERING DOWN.

CLOSER STILL ...

Betty reaches up and unties the little silk ribbon at the top

of her robe. She slips it off, and lets it drop to the floor,

standing naked in the middle of the bathroom. Betty glances

toward the mirror and then quickly glances away. She takes a

deep breath and steps into the tub.

EVEN TIGHTER. ON HER FACE ...

Betty slides down into the warm water, breathing in the

steam, and closing her eyes for a moment. She lingers like

that for a second or two, before settling a little lower in

the tub. Betty opens her eyes, but they only half open. There

is the slight trace of a smile.

EXTREME CLOSE UP BETTY'S FACE.

Her eyes close again as she bites her lower lip gently. The

water continues to THUNDER DOWN as she arches her back.

Betty's breathing seems to quicken as she opens her eyes all

over again:

HER POV. BATHROOM ...

ALL AT ONCE, EVERYTHING AROUND STARTS TO TURN FROM BLACK AND

WHITE TO COLOR. A BIRD OUT THE WINDOW BECOMES A RED BREASTED

ROBIN. THE TILE ON THE TUB TURNS OUT TO BE PURPLE. GREEN

TOWEL ... PINK ROBE ... BRIGHT YELLOW DAISIES ON THE PLASTIC

SHOWER CURTAIN.

CLOSE UP. BETTY'S FACE.

She stares in amazment. Beads of sweat form on Betty's

forehead as the world goes to TECHNICOLOR. The THUNDERING

WATER POUNDS IN THE BACKGROUND, but beneath can be heard the

beginnings of a faint, low, MOAN. Her eyes dart around the

room. Her breathing quickens: Faster ... Harder ... More

intense ... THEN SUDDENLY ...

EXT. ELM STREET. NIGHT.

The HUGE ELM TREE across the street suddenly BURSTS INTO

FLAMES. Fire shoots straight up into the sky as billowing

clouds of black smoke fill the air. BRIGHT ORANGE FLAMES

LIGHT UP THE NIGHT.

INT. PARKER LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.

David is staring at the television set when he notices a

weird orange glow. He glances behind him, out the living room

window ...

EXT. ELM STREET. NIGHT.

David comes racing out of the front door and down the walk. A

small CROWD has gathered in front of the fire. (They don't

seem frightened--just sort of amazed.) The street is still

BLACK AND WHITE but it is now bathed in a weird ORANGE LIGHT.

The flames leap higher and higher ...

FOLLOWING DAVID.

He takes off down the block, as fast as he can run. The crowd

continues to stare as David turns the corner at Main

Street ...

EXT. FIRE STATION.

He races in the front of the building SCREAMING at the top of

his lungs.

INT. FIRE STATION.

There is no sign of life on the ground floor. David races up

the stairs toward the bunk room on the second story.

INT. BUNKROOM.

All the firemen are sitting around playing Gin Rummy when

David rushes in the front door. They can hear his voice from

down the hall.

They still don't move. All the firemen just look at him from

their bunks with a perplexed expression.

All at once they spring to their feet grabbing their helmets

and their yellow slickers. They race to the landing just

outside the bunkroom and leap onto the pole ...

EXT. MAIN STREET. NIGHT.

The FIRE HAS SPREAD TO AN ADJOINING TREE as the FIRE ENGINE

comes SCREAMING toward the house from the top of the block.

David sits in the front of the truck next to the Fire Chief

who drives the vehicle at break neck speed.

The Fire ENGINE screeches to a halt. The Fire Chief looks

around ...

David shoots him a look then glances at the inferno. He

shakes his head and leaps from the truck.

FOLLOWING DAVID.

He races around to the back where the other firemen are

standing just as confused. David grabs one of the hoses and

begins to pull it from the truck.

He strips out about fifteen feet of hose, then grabs the

fireman and pulls him toward the curb. David parts the crowd

and positions the man right in front of the flames.

The Fireman nods and does as he is told. David opens the

valve sending out a huge FLUME OF WATER.

A huge smile breaks out across the fireman's face--like a man

who has suddenly found his purpose in life. He beams from ear

to ear dousing the flames, while David runs to get another

hose ...

EXT. TOWN HALL. DAY

David stands at a podium receiving a commendation from "Big"

Bob McGee (the man from the barbershop). He holds a large

plaque up for public display, while "David's" whole family

beams in the background.

WIDER.

A huge crowd is gathered on the town hall steps. There are

lots of balloons and bunting.

He hands the plaque to David as the entire town bursts into

APPLAUSE.

EXT. MAIN STREET. LATER ...

David walks away from the center of town looking down at his

plaque. He takes his sleeve and starts to rub off a smudge

when a young woman comes up beside him.

WIDER.

She is MARGARET ANNE HENDERSON, the prettiest girl in school,

and one of the most popular. Margaret wears a frilly polka

dot dress, that only accentuates a bombshell '50s figure.

Nonetheless, she seems the image of girly innocence.

All at once, Margaret grabs his arm and presses herself up

against him. Her breasts shove up against his chest. Her

mouth is inches away from his.

David can smell the weird combination of hot moist breath and

freshly baked cookies. He stares into her eyes for a moment,

unable to speak. Margaret flashes him a not-so Pleasantville

smile.

She turns and heads around the comer, while David just

watches her dumbstruck.

SODA SHOP. DUSK.

David heads toward work with his apron and little paper hat.

The BUDDY HOLLY music has given way to "hip" '50s JAZZ. DAVE

BRUBECK drifts out of the soda shop as David pauses for a

moment, takes a bite of his oatmeal cookie, and heads inside.

SODA SHOP.

The place has "morphed" even more. If it was a teenage

hangout before, it has become almost a Bohemian coffee house

now. Brubeck's "TAKE FIVE" plays in the background while

several patrons talk "intensely" in their booths.

DOORWAY.

David walks into the building and pauses. Next to him, one of

the boys from the basketball team plays along with the jazz

on a BONGO DRUM. There are several COFFEE cups on the table.

Jennifer gets up quickly and comes over to him.

David glances at the booth beside them and realizes that the

bongos have stopped playing. All the kids are staring up at

him, with a weird expression of awe.

He crosses to the booth where Biff and two others look up at

him. It's like Elvis has entered the building.

They keep on staring. Several glances are exchanged back and

forth like they're sharing a secret. Finally ...

David hesitates, weighing his words.

This sends a MURMUR through the shop. The boy leans forward.

This sends a much LOUDER MURMUR rifling through the kids.

It's like electricity. They glance excited at one another. A

hush descends.

David stops and looks out at the kids who are hanging on

every word.

REVERSE ANGLE. INCLUDING DOORWAY.

Margaret Henderson (the girl with the cookies) stands in the

doorway staring at David. She hangs on his words with the

same excitement as the others, it just means so much more.

She stares right in his eyes. She's ten feet away but might

as well be touching him.

There's an excited giggle. They lean forward.

He moves forward extending a book. The cover reads: "THE

ADVENTURES OF HUCKELBERRY FINN." David opens the first page.

There is printing inside.

He looks over at her.

CLOSER.

David flips through the book and sure enough only the first

chapter has print. The pages are blank after that.

She has moved closer and is gazing at him from a couple of

feet away. It's silent in the soda shop.

David looks immediately down to the blank pages of the book

that aren't blank anymore. Rows and rows of FRESH NEW TYPE

materialize in front of him. He turns to the back of the

book, that is complete with a COLOR illustration.

He shoves another book in front of David.

EXT. PLEASANTVILLE PUBLIC LIBRARY. DAY.

The CAMERA PANS down from the "PUBLIC LIBRARY' sign to find

the front door. A long line of kids waiting to check out

their books stretches onto the sidewalk ...

EXTREME WIDE SHOT. LIBRARY. FROM ACROSS THE STREET.

Several men from the barbershop lean against the wall next to

the spinning barber pole. They watch the spectacle for a

moment or two, as teenager after teenager exits with an

armful of books.

Big Bob McGee nods and rubs his hands over his fresh haircut.

WIDER STILL.

From the shadows of the Town Hall, up the block, David

watches the stream of kids emerge with their books. They

cradle them in their hands like a piece of newfound

treasure ...

INT. PARKER LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.

George sits on the edge of his Barka Lounger, across the

coffee table from "Big" Bob McGee. Even sitting down the man

is a looming presence. Besides owning the market, auto

dealership, hardware store, and gas station, he also owns the

insurance agency where George works. George sweats into his

collar.

George nods as Bob takes a belt of his Martini and leans

forward.

George shrugs--then nods--then shrugs ...

Bob nods.

Bob takes a belt of his drink ...

There is no answer.

Still no answer.

WIDER.

George turns around to see David, standing on the landing,

listening to the entire conversation. Their eyes lock for a

moment ...

He moves quickly to the kitchen shutting the door behind him.

INT. KITCHEN.

David gets a couple of steps in and stops. He looks across

the room to see:

REVERSE ANGLE.

Betty standing at the kitchen sink, just staring out the

window. Her back is to him. She grips the formica kitchen

counter.

She doesn't answer. David moves up to her and rests a hand on

her shoulder.

Betty turns around to face him. HER FACE HAS TURNED

COMPLETELY TO COLOR. THE EYES ARE GREEN. THE LIPS ARE RED.

SHE HAS A NATURAL BLUSH IN HER CHEEKS. In fact the whole

thing looks like a beautiful color portrait except for the

tear stains on either side of her face.

David moves closer and looks at her. Her lip is quivering.

She looks right up at David.

DIFFERENT ANGLE.

He stares at her for a second. Big green eyes full of fear

and confusion. David pushes a reassuring smile.

He crosses to the counter and grabs her purse. David sits

Betty on a kitchen chair and fishes inside the handbag for

her compact. He finds it along with a wadded up Kleenex.

He dabs at the tears, while she smiles at him in gratitude,

Then David opens the compact and takes out the large GRAY

powder puff.

CLOSER.

It is a truly amazing sight. As David smears on the makeup,

she returns gradually to BLACK AND WHITE. The skin tones

disappear. The flush of her cheeks goes. David takes out a

DARK GRAY lipstick, obliterating the bright red of her lips.

REVERSE ANGLE. OVER BETTY'S SHOULDER.

He works on her for a second or two, then takes a step back.

All at once, David seems to wince:

REVERSE ANGLE. HIS POV. BETTY'S FACE.

The life is gone from her face. In an instant Betty has gone

from three dimensions to two. She stands in front of him, the

fictional version of herself all over again.

David shakes his head and forces a smile. He hands her the

compact so she can examine herself. Betty holds it up to her

face, turning her head first right, then left.

Betty takes a deep breath and fluffs her hair. She grabs the

plate of Pineapple kabobs and heads for the door. Just before

she goes in, she pauses, then plasters on a big wide

"stewardess" smile ...

He wants to say something, but doesn't. David shakes his

head.

She smiles again and balances the tray in front of her.

He watches as she opens the door, and marches in the room,

extending the little tray of hors d'oeuvres in front of

her ...

INT. SODA SHOP. DAY.

Mr. Johnson is all alone in the shop, setting up the napkin

dispensers. He whistles BRUBECK'S "TAKE FIVE" when the screen

door slams behind him. Mr. Johnson looks up with a start.

CLOSER. FOLLOWING DAVID.

He has a large book tucked under his arm that is easily three

feet long. Mr. Johnson looks at him a little intrigued as

David crosses to the counter.

Mr. Johnson reaches out and opens the cover. After a beat,

his eyes widen.

Mr. Johnson gasps. It's quiet, and subtle, but it's still a

gasp. David looks over at him but he's lost in the pages.

HIS POV. (INSERT) ART BOOK ...

Massacio's "Expulsion of Adam and Eve' leaps off the pages in

vibrant, tortured color. The beauty of the garden is offset

by their agony and their shame. HE TURNS THE PAGE ...

Titian's "Venus to Utano". Soft, fleshy, in a rich golden

light. She is utterly real and entirely nude. The folds of

her flesh almost seem to glow ...

Rembrandt's "Self Portrait." Dark reds, umbers, blacks and

browns. He looks back at Mr. Johnson with pain and wisdom.

There's a brilliant light on his hair.

Faintly, almost imperceptibly, the SOUND of a rich ARIA

begins to UNDERSCORE THE IMAGES. It's so faint you can't be

sure you even hear it at all ... like you're hearing it with

your eyes.

He TURNS THE PAGES faster. Breugal's "Harvesters" ... Tumees

"Steam Train" ... Monet's "Cathedralo" ... Cezanne's

"Oranges" ... Mr. Johnson shuts the book.

WIDER. SODA SHOP.

They sit like that for a beat.

He looks up at David, troubled.

Mr. Johnson shuts the book gently.

ANGLE. DAVID.

What can he say. David looks over at Mr. Johnson who just

smiles and shrugs.

CLOSE UP. DAVID.

He just stares for a second.

EXT. MAIN STREET. LONG SHOT. DAY.

Margaret walks up the center of Main Street toward the CAMERA

with her books pressed against her chest. She passes the

drugstore, then the hardware store ... Far off in the

distance, a young man comes racing out of the soda shop,

pulling off his little paper hat as he goes. He comes running

up behind her as fast as he can.

CLOSER.

He takes a deep breath and tries to quiet the panting.

Margaret stops in the street and turns to him.

He wants to turn away but doesn't. David forces himself to

stare at her and all of a sudden she beams. It's the whitest,

pearliest smile in the world.

EXT. ELM STREET. DAY.

David comes flying around the corner in complete jubilation.

He vaults over a parking meter, swings around a lampost and

leaps off the bumper of a parked car. David hi-fives into the

air at no one in particular and sails over Mr. Simpson's

hedge almost decking him in the process.

FOLLOWING DAVID.

He races across the street bobbing and weaving like an All

American fullback. David bounds up his front steps two at a

time flinging open the door.

INT. PARKER HOUSE. FOYER.

He lets the door slam behind him as he takes off his apron

and tosses it on the coat rack. David starts up the stairs,

when he HEARS a MAN'S VOICE coming from the living room.

He pauses a second and glances back.

He peers into the living room. David goes a little grayer ...

HIS POV. TELEVISION.

Dick Van Dyke is looking back at him from the middle of the

TV screen. He seems to have a bit of a stubble.

INT. LIVING ROOM.

David crosses slowly over to the TV set.

He gives a goony laugh. David just looks at him ...

The look turns suddenly dark and ominous.

He swttches off the TV sending Dick Van Dyke to electronic

limbo. David stands in the middle of the living room,

breathing hard ...

INT. JENNIFER'S (MARY SUE'S) ROOM.

She sits on the bed staring down at the front cover of a

book. (It's an alien experience.) Jennifer is just about to

open it when she senses something and glances toward the

door.

REVERSE ANGLE.

Bud is standing in the doorway just staring at her. He seems

to be out of breath.

He keeps breathing hard in the doorway. David holds the

remote in his hand.

He takes a couple of steps into the room and then suddenly

stops.

She holds up the cover.

He just stares at her for a second as his mind seems to

drift ...

He looks at her amazed--reliving the missed opportunity.

She stares at him wide-eyed like someone who has just heard

their name called. Jennifer's eyes dart around like she's

calculating a math problem. After a moment or two, her

expression changes: a vague look of recognition.

She glances down at her book. It's a big book. Jennifer takes

a deep breath and stares at the gray skin of her hand. After

a second or two, she looks back. David looks at her for a

beat ...

EXT. MARGARET HENDERSON'S HOUSE. (MAPLE STREET) DAY.

David gets out of his "dad's" convertible, carrying a dozen

"gray" roses. He takes a deep breath and heads up her front

walk ...

INT. CAR. NIGHT. LATER ...

David sits behind the wheel of the borrowed car with Margaret

Henderson by his side. He concentrates hard on the road,

holding the wheel at "10 and 2" as he steals a glance to his

right.

HIS POV. MARGARET.

It's not quite evening yet, and late afternoon light makes

her glow. Margaret smiles as she turns her face into the warm

wind that swirls inside the convertible ...

SHOT. DAVID.

He studies her for a moment or two, then suddenly swerves to

avoid a parked car on his right ...

WIDER.

They pass a sign with a happy family on it that reads:

"NOW LEAVING PLEASANTVILLE"

Main Street turns into a winding country road as they leave

the town behind and head off into the woods. They wind

through the dense woodland for a moment or two before a

second sign appears, much like the first:

"NOW ENTERING PLEASANTVILLE"

DIFFERENT ANGLE. THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD.

Sure enough, the town emerges in front of them again,

completing the 4 dimensional circle. David looks confused.

He looks over at her and smiles. Margaret turns on the radio.

EXT. CAR. DUSK.

SAM COOKE sings for them as David turns from Main Street onto

a smaller unmarked lane. The car starts to rise up a small

hill, with Dogwood trees blooming on either side of the road.

It continues to climb up the narrow gravel lane toward the

crest in the hill. David looks over at Margaret who takes a

deep breath shutting her eyes. He glances down at the seat

between them ...

HIS POV. CAR SEAT.

THE ROSES THAT WERE GRAY HAVE SUDDENLY TURNED TO COLOR. They

sit next to him on the seat: a deep, rich RED ...

INT. CAR.

David looks up and out the windshield. The same thing seems

to be happening around them ... Many of the Dogwoods have

started to turn PINK. Not all of them, but at least fifty

percent of the petals have "bloomed" in some weird false

spring. The road twists and turns on its way to the top, as

they finally reach a crest in the hill.

THEIR POV. LOVERS LANE.

There, sitting in front of them, is a whole world gone

Technicolor: THE LAKE IS BLUER THAN BLUE. THE WEEPING WILLOW

IS GREENER THAN GREEN. THE DOGWOOD PETALS (all "turned" now)

SWIRL IN THE WIND LIKE SOME STRANGE PINK SNOWSTORM. A LONG

LINE OF PASTEL CARS STRETCHES OUT ALONG THE SHORE.

SHOT. CAR.

Slowly, David rolls the convertible forward. Many of the kids

have left their cars and sit down along the grassy bank by

the edge of the water. A few of them have books open. It

almost looks "Athenian."

INT. CAR.

David looks at the whole scene for a moment then suddenly

cocks his head to the side.

Margaret looks at him and smiles. She leans well out of the

convertible, and plucks a Gardenia from a bush that is

blooming beside the car.

David takes the flower, then puts it up to his nose. He takes

a long deep breath then all at once, his posture seems to

relax. As the fragrance enters his body his eyes drift like

some strange narcotic is washing over him. David lowers the

flower ...

EXT. MAIN STREET. DUSK.

Betty is walking down Main Street with a shopping bag on

either hand. From a block away, she looks like any other

homemaker in Pleasantville. You don't even notice the gray

make-up.

CLOSER. FOLLOWING BETTY.

She nods to Mrs. Filmore in the bakery and smiles at Don in

the Post Office. Betty is just about to turn on Elm Street

when she glances up, and suddenly stops.

HER POV. ACROSS THE STREET.

There, in the middle of the block, sits Mr. Johnson's soda

shop. The whole scene is still black and white, except for

the large CUBIST PAINTING THAT FILLS MR. JOHNSON'S WINDOW. It

is rendered in bright PINKS, YELLOWS AND ORANGES, and looks

like a Braque or a Picasso except for the unusual subject

matter. Upon closer examination you see that all the spheres

and cones add up to an avante garde snow scene, with a Cubist

Santa hovering over the roof tops.

SHOT. BETTY.

She stares at it, mesmerized for a moment, then starts to

wander across the street. It's late afternoon and the

business district is empty. Betty crosses in the middle of

the block, staring straight ahead.

INT. SODA SHOP.

The door opens and she sticks her head inside. Most of the

place is dark except for one streak of sunlight shining

through the window near the back of the store. Betty glances

around. The little bell JINGLES as she enters.

DIFFERENT ANGLE.

He sits in front of a small easel near the back, staring at a

board which doubles as a canvas. Mr. Johnson glances over his

shoulder and recognizes Betty in the doorway.

REVERSE ANGLE.

He gets up from his stool and crosses toward the door, still

holding the palette in his hand. Betty stares at the "Cubist

Christmas" in the window.

Their eyes lock for a second. Sort of a clutzy silence. Mr.

Johnson motions toward his easel.

He sighs and looks behind him. Next to the easel is a bowl of

GRAY FRUIT.

He leads her over to the table and points down at the art

book. It's open to a Cezanne that nearly burns off the page.

CLOSER.

They are standing almost on top of each other gazing down at

the book. Neither one of them moves. Betty almost disappears

into the pictures--drawn by a strange new world.

He turns to Kandinsky--a massive swirl of color. The image is

nearly electric.

INSERT. BOOK.

He turns the page near the back to one of Picasso's "Weeping

Women." The woman is rendered in pink and red and green. Her

head is a large sphere, laying "peacefully" on her own

shoulder.

She doesn't answer ...

WIDER.

Mr. Johnson looks down at the painting.

He looks up at her ...

REVERSE ANGLE.

A single tear is running down Betty's cheek. She senses it

and reaches up to wipe it quickly away, but instead of just

wiping the tear, she takes off a huge swath of GRAY MAKE-UP.

A long strip of PINK FLESH is revealed underneath.

ANGLE. MR. JOHNSON.

He stares up at her in amazement.

ANGLE. BETTY.

She senses something and glances down at her hand. Her

fingertips are covered in GRAY MAKE-UP. Betty turns and bolts

for the door.

WIDER.

He stops her near the door and she turns her face toward the

wall. Mr. Johnson touches her shoulder.

He reaches up and gently touches her chin. Mr. Johnson moves

around to glimpse the other side of her cheek.

CLOSER ...

She freezes like that for a moment, then slowly, haltingly,

turns toward him. THE COLOR of her real flesh is revealed

underneath. Betty stands there exposed.

She swallows, not sure what to do. Betty glances down.

Mr. Johnson reaches over to the little napkin dispenser on

the counter and pulls one out. He leans forward and dabs at

the tears beneath Betty's eyes. Then slowly, gently, he

starts to wipe the makeup off her cheek.

CLOSER STILL ...

She recoils a bit, tensing up, then just looks at him. Mr.

Johnson is gazing at her "true color" with wonder and

acceptance. She hesitates for an instant, then seems to make

a decision. Betty slowly turns her face to the side, exposing

her flesh all the way down to the neck. Mr. Johnson continues

to wipe off the make up in larger and larger strokes as the

beautiful pink flesh begins to emerge ...

INT. JENNIFER'S (MARY SUE'S) ROOM. NIGHT.

She lies on her bed, reading the same book she was browsing

earlier. Jennifer seems strangely engrossed as she flips the

pages, lying on her stomach, scouring every word. After a

moment or two she gets restless and shifts position, lifting

the book. The cover is plainly visible: "LADY CHATTERLY'S

LOVER."

CLOSER.

She doesn't have enough light so Jennifer rises from the bed

and crosses to "her" desk. She sits in the chair and flattens

the book in front of her. Jennifer is deep into the plot and

doesn't even look up as she flicks on the desk lamp. She

could almost be studying algebra as she sits upright at the

little desk.

DIFFERENT ANGLE.

She flips the page and peers more intently. Her hair is

bothering her so she pulls it back and knots it in a pony

tail. After a little while her eyes begin to get more tired

and she looks up and blinks a couple of times. Jennifer

notices something across the desk.

REVERSE ANGLE.

A pair of Mary Sue's glasses are neatly folded in front of

her. Jennifer reaches out, puts them on her head, glances

back down at the print.

She can see much clearer now. Jennifer folds her hands in

front of her and doesn't even realize that she has mimicked

the PHOTOGRAPH OF MARY SUE THAT SITS BESIDE HER IN A SILVER

FRAME. The face is the same, but that's to be expected. So is

the pony tail, the glasses, the posture and the studious look

on her face. Jennifer turns the page engrossed in her novel

when there is a loud TAP on the window.

She rises from the desk and pulls back the curtain. Jennifer

slides open the window.

EXT. PARKER HOUSE.

Biff stands on the front lawn tossing pebbles at the window.

He jiggles some more.

She glances down at her book.

INT. JENNIFER'S ROOM.

She hesitates for a second then glances back at the desk. Her

own image in the silver frame stares back at her. The hair is

pulled back in a pony tail. The glasses sit on the front of

her nose.

She thinks about it for a moment, then suddenly smiles. Biff

stands dumbfounded on the sidewalk as Jennifer reaches up and

quietly closes the window ...

EXT. LOVER'S LANE. NIGHT.

David and Margaret sit on the edge of the grass, looking out

across the water. Even in the moonlight, the COLORS are

vivid. David still clutches the gardenia in his hand, taking

a long hit like an Opium addict.

Margaret laughs like that isn't even possible. She shifts on

the grass hiking her skirt up above the knee. It reveals a

long tan leg beneath it. David watches as she kicks off her

shoes, rubbing her feet through the long cool grass.

She clings onto the words like they could transport her by

themselves. David thinks for a moment.

She leans forward.

She giggles. David looks at her in amazement.

Suddenly and without warning Margaret unbuttons her cardigan

sweater. She slips it off, arching her back like the

figurehead of a ship and David just stares at her breasts.

She wears a light cotton blouse and even in the moonlight it

forms a translucent silhouette ... She lays the sweater

across the grass and leans back on it.

She unfolds a handkerchief revealing a handful of berries in

REDS AND BLUES AND PURPLES.

She hops up and scampers across the grassy bank, kicking her

heels behind her. Margaret reaches a tree in the distance and

reaches toward an upper limb, stretching out her body like a

piece of statuary. She picks a piece of fruit and scampers

back toward him, hiking up her skirt as she goes ...

CLOSER.

Margaret sticks out her hand, offering him a BRIGHT RED

APPLE. It's brilliant and shiny and glistens in the

moonlight.

ANGLE. DAVID.

He hesitates just looking at it. Margaret speaks in a

whisper.

HIS POV.

She is lying on her stomach now, and behind the outstretched

apple he can see an ample view of her cleavage. Margaret is

smiling at him as the apple shines in the foreground. David

reaches out and takes it.

WIDER. DAVID AND MARGARET.

For this instant, they seem alone in the garden. He looks

down at it, then glances over at Margaret. David hesitates

for a split second then takes a bite of the apple ...

EXT. ELM STREET. NIGHT.

George heads home with his briefcase in hand whistling a

happy tune. He smiles at Mr. Simpson and swings the attache

case as he turns and heads up his front walk.

INT. FOYER.

George opens the door and sets the briefcase by the stairs

like he always does. He hangs his hat on the hatrack, his

coat on the coatrack, and beams as he hollers his nightly

greeting:

There is no response. He looks a little perplexed but smiles

as he calls out again:

There is more silence. George looks around a little confused

when there is a BOOMING CLAP OF THUNDER ...

INT. SODA SHOP. NIGHT.

Betty sits in a comer of the shop, next to the gray bowl of

fruit. She holds her head to the side, sitting gracefully

with her chin in the air. Mr. Johnson sits behind his easel,

painting her portrait from a few feet away. Betty looks

radiant with no trace of the makeup, the warm PINK OF HER

FLESH TONES lit softly by a bare forty watt bulb ...

CLOSER.

She looks over at Mr. Johnson when they hear the BOOMING CLAP

OF THUNDER. Each of them freezes. There is ANOTHER, LOUDER

BOOM ...

ANGLE. WINDOW.

The "Cubist Snowscene" lights up brightly, illuminated by the

sudden flash of lightning behind it. Betty leaps up from the

chair and crosses to the window looking out.

Betty looks back at Mr. Johnson and suddenly sees the

painting. She flinches for a second. Her eyes go wide.

REVERSE ANGLE. INCLUDING THE PAINTING.

It is Cubist (like the rest of his recent work) but that

isn't the shocking part. Even though she sits in front of him

fully clothed, Mr. Johnson has painted a beautiful, sensual

nude. Betty just stares at the canvas, stunned to see herself

revealed like that. The COLORS are all hot pinks and oranges

and yellows--like some Fauvist celebration of summertime.

There is another even LOUDER PEEL OF THUNDER.

WIDER. BETTY AND MR. JOHNSON.

She looks over at Mr. Johnson and he glances down. After a

moment or two he looks back at her, but she doesn't turn to

run. Betty just stares at him, then without even realizing

it, moves slightly closer.

EXT. LOVER'S LANE. NIGHT.

David and Margaret are locked in a deep passionate kiss. At

first they don't separate when they hear the BOOMING CLAP OF

THUNDER. It is only when they hear the SECOND ONE and the

RAIN starts to fall, that Margaret pulls back and looks up in

the sky.

ANGLE. DAVID.

He is still in an amorous daze and doesn't even feel the

increasing rain. It starts to pound harder and Margaret looks

to him in terror.

She looks at him frightened. David smiles.

He puts his jacket around her and starts to lead her up the

grassy slope. A dozen other couples go scurrying up the bank,

looking in terror at the water falling from the sky.

He goes fishing around the boot of the car, looking for the

catch to release it. David leans into the back seat fishing

around as the rain starts to pound harder.

He looks back at her. No top either. David smiles, drenched

in rain and puts his arm around Margaret who is starting to

shiver.

He leads her back to a thicket of bushes where several of the

kids are clustered together. They look at one another,

terrified, as they huddle for shelter beneath the ledge of an

overhanging rock.

They look a little reassured and Margaret looks up at him

positively adoringly. She clings to his shoulder as the storm

howls a few feet away ...

INT. JENNIFER'S ROOM. NIGHT.

She stands at the window looking out at the driving rain.

Jennifer still holds the D.H. Lawrence book in her hand.

There is a huge flash of lightning and another clap of

thunder.

She flops back down on the bed and continues to read ...

PARKER LIVING ROOM.

George wanders through the empty and darkened house

completely perplexed and utterly disoriented. He looks around

for his family, but all he can find are the darkened rooms

and the sound of the driving storm.

He still can't find her and he crosses into the DINING ROOM.

The lights are dark there as well and he looks around

confused.

He sniffs a couple of times but there are no familiar cooking

smells. George flings open the door to the kitchen but that's

empty as well.

KITCHEN.

He crosses into the darkness ...

INT. FOYER.

George comes reeling out of the kitchen into the foyer. He

slams his shin on the coatrack but keeps on going ...

EXT. HOUSE.

It's really blowing now. The rain is coming down in heavy

sheets, being swirled and driven by the wind. The front door

opens and George wanders out onto the front porch, still

dressed in his shirtsleeves.

ON GEORGE.

He stumbles down the front walk in a state of complete

confusion. The rain pounds against his body and within

seconds his shirt is soaked through to the skin.

EXT. ELM STREET.

A tree limb crashes to the ground but he keeps stumbling

through the torrent. George reels down Elm Street screaming

skyward in the distance.

SERIES OF SHOTS. FOLLOWING GEORGE ...

He turns on Main Street and goes reeling past the insurance

agency where he works. George howls into the wind and he

passes the hardware store, the gas station, the bakery ...

Finally he pauses outside the barbershop. It's empty as well

with the spinning barber pole being buffeted by the rain.

George lowers his arms and just stares into the darkened

shop. His voice grows quieter bewildered and shivering ...

He wraps his arms around himself and shivers on the sidewalk.

INT. BOWLING ALLEY. NIGHT.

The regular occupants of the barber shop spread out across

three lanes. Each wears a Pleasantville bowling shirt,

sponsored by one of Big Bob's businesses.

The NOISE from the crashing pins is deafening and there

aren't any windows so the storm has gone unnoticed ...

ANGLE. BIG BOB.

He picks up a 7-10 split and claps his hands in delight. He

starts to cross back to the scorer's table when he looks up

and suddenly stops.

REVERSE ANGLE. HIS POV.

George is standing in the doorway to the bowling alley cold

and shivering. His shirt is soaked through to the skin. His

hair is drenched and dripping.

He doesn't answer. George clutches his body and keeps

shivering.

WIDER.

The men stop bowling and rush to George's side. He blinks a

couple of times, still soaked to the bone.

George nods. Bob rushes to the glass door of the bowling

alley and sees the driving storm. A huge fork of lightning

lights up the sky.

He turns back to George.

George shivers and Bobs leads him over to one of the benches

and guides him into the seat ...

ANGLE. MEN.

They all nod in recognition.

ANGLE. GEORGE.

A MURMUR goes through the men.

They all GASP.

The men nod and lean forward. George shakes his head.

A LOUDER MURMUR moves through the crowd. George lowers his

head and just shakes it from side to side. Big Bob moves up

and puts a hand on his shoulder.

George looks up at him helplessly. Bob pats him reassuringly

on the back.

They murmur again. Bob gathers a little steam.

They nod in agreement.

Gus nods. Big Bob turns to George and smiles. It's a warm,

patriarchal smile. He claps a hand on George's shoulder.

INT. SODA SHOP. NIGHT.

The rain still pounds out the window. Betty and Mr. Johnson

are huddled in one of the booths watching the deluge through

Mr. Johnson's snow scene in the window. Betty is in soft

radiant color now. Almost the whole frame seems to glow

pink ...

There is another fork of lightning and a booming peel of

THUNDER. Betty sighs. She's past struggling. Betty shuts her

eyes for a moment and listens to the rain pounding on the

roof.

There is another flash and a loud BOOM. Betty smiles this

time.

Betty smiles. They both listen for a moment and the fear

seems to fade a little. The RAIN POUNDS harder on the roof as

Betty nestles down in the booth, a little closer to Mr.

Johnson. They just sit there listening for a moment or two.

Betty starts to smile ...

EXT. LOVER'S LANE.

David huddles with Margaret under the rocky ledge as she

nestles against him with her head on his shoulder.

INT. JENNIFER'S ROOM.

She lies on her bed, still reading the book, the spitting

image of Mary Sue. Her hair is up in a bun now. The glasses

have slipped down her nose. There is another fork of

lightning and the LOUDEST THUNDER CLAP of all. Jennifer

smiles slightly and pulls Mary Sue's afghan over her

shoulders as she fluffs the pillow and turns the page.

CLOSE UP. A BRIGHT RED ROSE.

Drops of moisture cling to the petals as it GLEAMS BRILLIANT

RED IN THE MORNING SUN ...

AERIAL SHOT. PLEASANTVILLE.

The rain is gone now. The town glistens in the sunlight

complete with a huge RAINBOW arching across the sky.

Literally all the COLORS IN THE RAINBOW shine against the

black and white of the town. It looks like a greeting card.

INT. SODA SHOP.

Betty and Mr. Johnson are asleep in the booth, lying in each

other's arms. Sunlight streams in through the window, warming

Mr. Johnson's face which has now turned to color. He opens

his eyes and looks outside ...

EXT. LOVER'S LANE.

Birds are chirping. David and Margaret also lie asleep in

each other's arms, beneath the shelter of the rocky overhang.

Margaret lifts up and sees the rainbow. She has turned to

color as well ...

INT. JENNIFER'S ROOM.

She has passed out on her bed with her book on her chest.

Jennifer's hair is still tied in a bun and she still wears

Mary Sue's glasses, but her face has returned to its rosy

pink hue. She blinks open her eyes, feeling the sunlight, and

looks out the window.

INT. BOWLING ALLEY.

The men are all passed out across the various lanes and

scoring tables. It looks like a YMCA shelter. After a moment

or two Big Bob yawns, and stretches, and glances out the

glass doorway. He sees the rainbow and freezes in shock.

EXT. ELM ST. DAY.

David comes gliding up Maple Street in the sunshine with a

huge smile on his face. He has that special grin and faraway

look that a boy only knows once in his life. Perplexingly he

is still in black and white. Bud turns on Elm Street and

starts heading for his house when he glances up and suddenly

freezes.

HIS POV. TREE TRUNK.

There, tacked to the bark, is a hastily scrawled public

notice:

TOWN MEETING TONIGHT

ALL "TRUE" CITIZENS

OF PLEASANTVILLE

ANGLE. DAVID.

He looks up at it for a moment.

INT. PARKER KITCHEN. DUSK.

George and Betty stand face to face in their suburban

kitchen. He is black and white. She is in full color.

Betty turns--glances out the window.

She turns to face him. George flinches slightly.

George's eyes widen. It's a watershed moment.

He suddenly squares back his shoulders and puffs out his

chest.

His expression leaves as quickly as it came. Betty moves

closer to him.

George's eyes widen.

She turns and starts out the kitchen door when George calls

after her.

And she closes the door behind her.

EXT. TOWN HALL. NIGHT.

Dozens of black and white citizens stream in through the

front door.

SHOT. OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE STREET.

Several "transformed" teenagers stare at the spectacle with

their FLESH COLORED SKIN AND BRIGHT BLUE EYES. They seem to

hang back in the shadows.

INT. TOWN HALL.

Big Bob stands at the podium beneath a permanent banner that

reads "PLEASANTVILLE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE." As the only

legally constituted body in Pleasantville, it is a natural

place for a town meeting. There is nothing bright and cheery

however. The floor lamps in each comer cast huge, looming

shadows up the walls. The light at the podium bathes Big

Bob's face in a blinding splash of light. The whole thing

evokes some weird twisted image from German Expressionism--

like they are about to go look for Frankenstein. It is grayer

than gray.

CLOSER. PODIUM.

Big Bob stands at a lectern with a Rotary insignia on the

front. He speaks calmly but compellingly to a hundred men and

women who hang on his every word. Bob holds a BRIGHT YELLOW

GRAPEFRUIT.

There is a murmur from the crowd ...

CLOSE UP. GEORGE.

He sits up on the stage in an honored position right behind

Bob. George wears a shiny new ROTARY PIN in his lapel, as a

full-fledged member of the Chamber of Commerce. He sits stoic

and upright with the sense of safety and reassurance that a

shiny new pin can give you.

SHOT. BOB.

He holds up a pair of BRIGHT RED BOXER SHORTS.

There is a LOUDER MURMUR. The crowd shifts in their seats.

Bob points behind him to a BRIGHT GREEN lawn chair.

The MURMUR starts to grow ...

EXT. ELM STREET. NIGHT.

David and Margaret stand beneath the big Elm tree outside

Margaret's house: a statue of two young lovers. They wrap

their arms around each other in a classic silhouette. The

meeting across town seems a million miles away. After a

moment or two, David reaches behind the tree and pulls out a

beautifully wrapped gift. It is three feet long with a bright

RED bow.

Margaret's eyes widen. She beams at him, then tears off the

wrapping paper revealing a great big umbrella ... a real

umbrella. She looks up at him thrilled.

She looks down and giggles.

Margaret gives him a quick kiss then opens the umbrella. She

puts it back on her shoulder and turns a series of

pirouettes--like her own kind of rain dance. Margaret points

her face up to the sky as if she is being showered by a

summer storm. All at once a pair of HEADLIGHTS round the

corner.

WIDER.

David grabs the umbrella and closes it quickly. Margaret

looks to the street as the convertible slows to a crawl and

two TEENAGE BOYS pull up beside them. They are clean cut with

BLACK AND WHITE faces ...

They smile at each other for no good reason. It's scary and

arrogant.

He points to an ARMBAND that has some sort of Chamber of

Commerce seal on it. Whitey leans out of the car and

leers ...

Margaret literally flinches. The boys share a PEEL OF

LAUGHTER AND SNORT AT EACH OTHER. David puts an arm around

her and pulls her close.

He guns the engine as if to leave, then pauses and turns

toward Margaret.

They share another CHORTLE as Whitey guns the car and peels

out with a SCREECH. Margaret's lip starts to quiver and David

holds her tighter ...

She nods, groping for reassurance ...

INT. TOWN HALL. NIGHT.

The chamber of commerce meeting is still in full swing.

Various citizens are now on their feet, screaming from the

audience.

SHOT. GEORGE.

He still sits behind Bob with the same stoic expression on

his face. George fingers the little pin in his lapel ...

SHOT. BOB.

Bob lifts his hands in the air. The crowd quiets down a bit.

There is a loud murmur and nod of agreement ...

INT. SODA SHOP. NIGHT.

Mr. Johnson has scrubbed the snow scene from the window and

stares with his palette at a blank pane of glass. There is a

knock at the door ...

WIDER.

Mr. Johnson puts down the paints and crosses to open it.

Betty is standing in the doorway clutching her purse and a

"Lady Samsonite Weekender" bag. She stares up into his eyes.

FULL SHOT. SHOP WINDOW. MORNING.

Burt Campbell opens up the hardware store like he does every

morning, only today there is a slight difference. He swings

open the door, puts out the rakes and shovels, then sets a

newly handwritten sign clearly in the front window:

"NO COLOREDS"

SERIES OF SHOTS. SHOP WINDOWS.

As the businesses are opened on Main Street, more and more

"NO COLOREDS" signs appear in the windows: next to the

donuts ... by fishing poles ... beside the stationery

supplies ... Everything else looks frighteningly the same...

EXT. MAIN STREET. DAY.

Joey Anderson, the local paper boy, is finishing his morning

rounds. He reaches in his bag and tosses left toward the

bakery. Then he throws right toward the post office. Then he

turns left toward the soda shop, does a double take and slams

into a trash can ...

WIDER. SODA SHOP.

Where Mr. Johnson had once painted his cubist snow scene,

there is a brand new painting that isn't cubist at all. A

NUDE version of Betty graces the shop window--painted in

curving sensual brush strokes. Joey stops his bike and just

stares in amazement. He gets up and rides away as fast as he

possibly can ...

MAIN STREET. LATER ...

David is in a happy daze, wandering up Main Street and

doesn't even notice the crowd gathered outside Mr. Johnson's

soda shop. After a moment or two, he glances up and sees the

window ...

CLOSER. DAVID.

His eyes go wide. The murmur of the crowd grows louder as

stray derisive comments rise above the noise. David glances

from the nude in window to the growing angry mob ...

MAIN STREET. DAY.

David goes tearing through the business district looking for

any sign of his "mother." He glances in the flower shop ...

toward the green grocer ... David is just about to turn on

Elm Street when a booming voice seems to come from the

sky ...

David stops and looks to his right. There, in the window of

the Philco TV store, are twenty screens of various sizes

displaying the image of Dick Van Dyke.

The sound reverberates like God Himself. David ducks inside

the store, slamming the door behind him.

INT. STORE.

Fifty Dick Van Dyke's stare at him from every TV in the

store. The effect is smothering.

David glances around, not sure where to look.

Dick Van Dyke looks at him for a beat, then goes "red" in the

face.

SHOT. TV SCREEN.

All at once a box appears in the upper right hand comer of

the screen containing the image of David and Margaret at

Lover's Lane. The VIDEOTAPE rolls forward as she extends the

BRIGHT RED APPLE. David hesitates, then takes it, then puts

it to his mouth and takes a bite.

The image of David biting the apple PLAYS BACKWARDS AND

FORWARDS like some football instant replay ...

WIDER.

David just stares at the repeated images of Dick Van Dyke on

the TV screens.

He lunges toward the screen and slams his hand against the

"barrier."

Dick Van Dyke looks at him stunned as David turns and leaves

the shop.

ELM STREET. DAY.

David sprints down the tree lined street toward his house.

The leaves on some of the trees are starting to turn GREEN

even this far into town. David vaults over Mr. Simpson's

hedge and goes tearing up his front walk.

INT. FOYER.

The door flies open and he rushes in, breathless. David

glances around the house to make sure that it is empty. He

crosses into the living room.

INT. LIVING ROOM.

David rushes to the TV and grabs the remote. He looks down at

it, glances at the television, then bolts for the front door.

MAIN STREET. DAY.

David moves quickly down Main Street looking for a place to

stash the remote. He pauses in front of the Pleasantville

Travel Agency. It has posters in the window depicting various

destinations in and around Pleasantville (the place doesn't

see much business). David bends down to stash the remote in a

drain pipe near the entrance when he hears VOICES from up the

street.

WIDER.

David turns to see a small crowd up near the end of Main

Street. He sticks the remote in the drain pipe and rises to

his feet as the voices get louder.

DIFFERENT ANGLE.

The crowd is moving toward him. A woman walks in front of a

group of young men who circle around her, taunting and

harassing her. A moment later David can make out the face:

BETTY clutches her handbag to her chest while the crowd

circles her like a pack of dogs.

CLOSER. BETTY.

The ROSY HUE of her face stands out in stark relief to the

black and white faces around her. Betty holds her head high

with dignity (and fear) while the ugly epithets overlap one

another "Oooh--let's see the rest of you ... Let's see what's

under that nice blue dress ... Bet she's even pinker than her

picture ..." One of the boys yanks at Betty's skirt and she

quickens her pace. Just at that moment the boy is shoved to

the ground ...

WIDER.

David shields his "mother" as he shoves one of the boys into

the dirt. The kid gets up but David punches him hard in the

side of the jaw and the rest of them just stare. (Violence is

as new as anything else and it seems to freeze the moment.)

David steps in front of his "mother" with both fists

clenched.

He plants his back foot primed for action. The crowd of black

and white thugs just stares at it.

ANGLE. CROWD.

They look at him warily. The boy reaches up and feels the

side of his mouth where a trickle of RED BLOOD is running

down his chin. He looks at his finger in horror and starts

backing away.

They back away further and David takes a threatening step.

The boys turn and run as he turns back to face his "mother."

DIFFERENT ANGLE. BETTY. (OVER DAVID'S SHOULDER)

David moves up to her gently.

She nods, still clutching her purse to her chest. David

reaches out and touches her cheek when suddenly her eyes go

wide.

CLOSER. STILL OVER DAVID'S SHOULDER.

Betty reaches into her purse and pulls out her compact. She

opens it, and holds it up to David, showing him the reflected

image of his own face. AT LAST HE HAS TURNED TO COLOR.

REVERSE ANGLE. DAVID.

He holds the mirror staring at his own reflection. The

courage which transformed him only seems to grow. They look

at each other, both in color now, when David puts a gentle

arm around her shoulder.

He begins to lead her up toward the corner.

FULL SHOT. SODA SHOP WINDOW. DAY.

A larger crowd of hooligans has now gathered around the nude

painting of Betty in the window. The jeers and cat calls are

even louder. The "closed" sign still sits in the doorway.

After a beat or two, a HUGE BRICK SHATTERS THE GLASS ...

WIDER.

A big CHEER goes up from the crowd. Drunk on adrenalin, the

fever builds and ANOTHER BRICK SMASHES THE WINDOW. In an

instant, Mr. Johnson's "canvas" is totally destroyed. The

CHEERING grows louder ...

Almost by osmosis, the crowd rushes the building together.

The door is kicked in and they stream into the place. Soon

all that can be heard is the weird SOUND OF LAUGHTER AND

BROKEN GLASS.

INT. SODA SHOP.

It is an orgy of destruction. Stools are hurled--tables

ripped out. The cash register is turned over. Two boys kick

in the front of the juke box ...

EXT. MAIN ST. DAY.

David and Betty round the corner to find the Soda Shop being

destroyed. They stand at the far side of the intersection

watching the carnage as the crowd continues to run amok.

After a moment or two, there are some more HOOTS as MARGARET

comes running toward them with the front of her blouse ripped

open.

He takes her in his arms and Margaret starts to sob. David

strokes her hair.

She nods. Margaret catches her breath for a moment or two,

then glances down to her side ...

WIDER.

She is clutching the umbrella in her left hand. The thing has

been ripped to shreds. The spines are broken and the fabric

is torn. Margaret stares at the thing with a combination of

confusion and shame. David goes white with rage and looks

toward the mob.

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD. (LEADING TO LOVER'S LANE).

They all ride in George's convertible up the twisting turning

road. It has turned completely PINK with the dogwood petals.

David winds up the trail, in the fading light, looking for

refuge. He clutches the wheel tight.

DIFFERENT ANGLE. THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD.

The car twists and turns up the narrow dirt road. After a

moment, Lover's Lane reveals itself. It is lush and green

like before only this time, there is one major difference. A

phalanx of BLACK AND WHITE THUGS have created a roadblock in

the foreground.

WIDER.

David jams on his breaks when he sees the barrier. It is a

weird incongruous image: the black and white roadblock in

front with the vibrant colors of the pond and willow behind--

like some perfect dream you can never get to. The thugs have

turned their cars sideways and dragged several huge logs

across the road. They hold axe-handles in their hands.

EXT. MAIN STREET. NIGHT.

Darkness has fallen and the streetlamps have come on. Some

debris is scattered around the street and distant sounds of

the mob still fill the air. David rolls back into town with

the headlights off.

CLOSER. CAR.

They head down Main St. and turn the comer on Walnut. All at

once, a weird ORANGE LIGHT bathes the car ...

REVERSE ANGLE. THEIR POV.

A BONFIRE has been lit in the middle of the street between the

library and the barber shop. Twenty to thirty people are

gathered around it still whooping and hollering as the bright

ORANGE FLAMES shoot into the air.

ANGLE. CAR.

David pulls over by the curb, and their eyes go wide ...

REVERSE ANGLE.

From closer up, it becomes clear what they're burning. Huge

piles of library books have been dumped onto the sidewalk,

waiting their turn on the pyre. There is a strange celebratory

atmosphere as they chuck book after book on the flames, with

the glee of a teenager tossing a firecracker. David sees

something and bolts from the car ...

ANGLE. SIDE OF THE BONFIRE.

Jennifer is locked in some strange wrestling match with Biff.

He clutches a book over her head while she tugs at his wrist

trying to stop him from throwing it on the fire ...

Jennifer wrestles with him for a couple of seconds and then

suddenly kicks Biff in the groin. He doubles over in agony

when Jennifer snatches the book and bolts in the other

direction.

DIFFERENT ANGLE. STREET.

She sprints up the street and is just passing the barber shop

when a hand reaches out and grabs her. Jennifer starts to

scream but David puts a hand to her mouth.

WIDE SHOT. SODA SHOP. OTHER SIDE OF MAIN STREET.

The crowd has moved on and all that is left is the dark

wreckage of the soda shop. Several stools lie out in the

street and shards of brightly painted glass are scattered

around the sidewalk. It is eerily quiet.

WIDER.

David, Betty and Margaret sit silently in the car, across the

street with the lights off. He unlatches the door handle and

gets out slowly. The rest of them follow him into the empty

street as they move silently toward the soda shop, like some

platoon on patrol.

REVERSE ANGLE.

As they get closer, more of the wreckage comes into view. Half

a booth ... a soda spigot ... After a moment or two Jennifer

looks up and gasps.

CLOSER.

Several teenagers step out of the shadows. They have scraped

faces and ripped clothing--the signs. Most are dazed and ALL

OF THEM ARE IN COLOR. After a second or two, more appear:

Mary Jane ... Lisa Anne ... The boy who was reading Huck

Finn...

ANGLE. DAVID.

The kids turn to him as if he has some kind of answer. Of

course he doesn't. The sounds of the Mob still carry through

the air from somewhere off in the distance.

INT. SODA SHOP.

The place is just sad. All the remnants of what they had are

strewn around the floor, The jukebox is turned over. The

stools are ripped out of the floor. Betty looks over at the

corner where he painted her ... The easel is smashed to bits.

ANGLE. BETTY.

She brings a knuckle to her lip and David puts an arm around

her and draws her close. After a moment or two they HEAR a

weird SCRAPING sound.

The SCRAPING SOUND stops. They all look to the open door and

after a second or two, Mr. Johnson appears holding a broom and

dustpan.

Betty runs across and throws her arms around him. The

teenagers watch as she holds him tight.

Betty stifles a sob as he strokes her hair. No one says

anything while they just embrace for a moment. Finally ...

They respond to the tone of leadership. One by one the kids

start to pitch in, sifting their way through the wreckage.

Jennifer and David slide a barricade in front of the door as

the kids try to put their shop back together.

INT. TOWN HALL. (CHAMBER OF COMMERCE MEETING) NIGHT.

Big Bob stands at the podium addressing a packed house. The

atmosphere is odd: somewhere between a bake-off and a

lynching. People sit in the aisles and in the window sills.

Bob points his finger.

The crowd quiets a bit. He leans over the lectern.

His tone grows softer--more concerned ...

ANGLE. CROWD.

They murmur and nod ...

EXT. BONFIRE. NIGHT.

It is still ablaze with books. As Bob continues to READ in

VOICE OVER, a firetruck comes screeching up to the curb.

SHOT. FIRETRUCK.

The same fireman who learned to use the hose before pulls

several yards of it from the back of the truck. He can barely

contain his excitement as he gets to open the valve and

extinguish the raging bonfire ...

SERIES OF SHOTS. LAMPPOSTS.

The CODE OF CONDUCT is nailed to lampposts and tree trunks in

rapid succession. It is plastered on walls and in shop

windows ...

SODA SHOP.

Debris is still strewn around the street. A dim light

emanates from inside.

INT. SODA SHOP.

It looks like a scene from the French Revolution. Ten to

fifteen kids huddle behind the barricade while David reads

the code of conduct out loud by flashlight.

David just looks at her then continues.

This sends a murmur amongst the kids.

David holds up his hand.

Various glances dart back and forth between them. David

continues.

David looks over at Mr. Johnson who just winces slightly.

Betty clutches his hand.

David lowers the paper.

DIFFERENT ANGLE.

It is SILENT in the soda shop. Everyone sits motionless for a

moment or two, letting the decree sink in. David just stares

down at the piece of paper in his hand with a weird kind of

sadness.

Off in the corner, however, one of the boys has been fiddling

with the jukebox and hasn't paid any attention to what was

being read. All of a sudden, his voice rings from the corner.

He hits a button and BUDDY HOLLY's voice fills the soda shop.

RAVE ON blares at almost top volume recalling a more festive

time.

The boy looks back at her.

He flinches and pulls the plug from the wall. The jukebox

winds down with a groan as the electricity drains out of it.

David looks at the kids then suddenly speaks in a calm clear

tone.

He walks across the soda shop and plugs it back in. The kids

watch spellbound at this personal display of defiance.

WIDER SHOT. SODA SHOP.

Buddy Holly's voice fills the Soda Shop but it has a suddenly

different meaning. All the kids listen spellbound, as if to

an anthem, while the Rock and Roll lives up to its rebellious

reputation.

Jennifer looks over at her brother with pride. Betty puts an

arm around Mr. Johnson, feeling a little stronger--a little

safer ... The kids seem to relax a bit, and even if they

don't feel totally reassured, at least they don't feel

ashamed.

Twenty "colored" faces listen as Buddy Holly tells them RAVE

ON. David stands beside the jukebox like a captain at the

helm of his ship ...

EXT. STREET. LATER ...

He steps out over the debris and looks both directions. David

motions toward the shop and a moment later the kids emerge.

The disturbance seems to have died down and the street is

silent although strewn with debris. David turns to the kids.

They nod and head off down the block. David just watches them

silently from the wreckage of the soda shop ...

EXT. TOWN SQUARE. NIGHT.

The Fire Department is cleaning up the charred remains of the

bonfire ...

INT. SODA SHOP. LATER ...

Betty is asleep in one of the booths. Jennifer sleeps beside

her on the floor. David and Margaret sleep next to them in

another booth with Margaret curled up against his chest.

David opens his eyes.

REVERSE ANGLE. HIS POV.

Mr. Johnson is standing in the middle of the shop, staring at

the large piece of plywood where his window used to be. He

just gazes at the thing as if he could look through it.

There's a faraway look in his eye.

SHOT. DAVID.

He rises carefully from the booth, without waking Margaret.

David crosses over to Mr. Johnson and speaks in a whisper.

CLOSE UP. DAVID.

He just nods. David glances down at the table next to him. He

picks up one of the brightly painted shards of glass and just

looks at it. It's orange and pink and yellow. David thinks

for a second.

EXT. MAIN STREET. DAWN.

The same paper boy who rode into the trash can, peddles down

Main Street tossing his papers toward the curb. He throws

right toward the post office, then left toward the hardware

store, then right toward the bakery, then finally looks up.

CLOSER.

This time the boy slams into a lamp post. He tumbles off his

bike and stares straight ahead in disbelief ...

HIS POV. TOWN HALL.

Two men sleep at the base of the wall next to a clutter of

paint cans. Above them, however, is painted A VIVID ALMOST

UTOPIAN MURAL OF THE TOWN OF PLEASANTVILLE in LIVING COLOR.

Instead of being drab, the place literally gleams with life.

The post office turns out to be a RICH RED BRICK. The sky

shines in vibrant BLUE. It is a rendering of what the town

could look like. David and Mr. Johnson sleep soundly next to

their own signatures. David opens his eyes and sees the

paperboy ...

ANGLE. PAPER BOY.

He turns around and rides away as fast as he can.

EXT. TOWN HALL. LATER ...

A huge crowd has gathered. There is a loud buzz in the air.

David and Mr. Johnson stand side by side in front of their

work like they're presenting and guarding it at the same

time.

REVERSE ANGLE. CROWD.

Most of the faces are black and white. A few near the back

are in color. Big Bob moves through the back of the crowd,

hurriedly buttoning his shirt. The buzz grows and the people

part as he heads toward the front of the pack ...

ANGLE. FRONT OF CROWD.

When Bob emerges from the crowd, Mr. Johnson flinches

slightly. David just looks him in the eye and tries to find

as much courage as he can. "Big" Bob looks up at the color

rendering of his town with absolute horror. His eye scans the

green trees, the bright yellow gas station, the puffy pink

clouds on the horizon.

Bob grabs a copy of the Code of Conduct and waves it at him.

Bob looks dumbfounded. He tries to process the whole thing

but just looks more confused. Bob runs his hand through his

hair, shaking his head.

ANGLE. BACK OF CROWD.

Betty stands beside Margaret and Jennifer watching the

spectacle. There are tears in her eyes and a great deal of

love. Jennifer smiles with pride at her brother ...

SHOT. BOB.

There is some clapping from the back of the crowd. Bob's eyes

widen. His face goes flushed (darker gray). A vein bulges in

his neck. He turns to the police chief.

David walks toward the police chief and sticks his hands out.

A louder murmur moves through the crowd as David actually

helps him fasten on the cuffs. Mr. Johnson comes over to join

them and the murmur starts to grow ...

NIGHT TIME.

A bright full moon stands out against a jet black sky ...

EXT. MAIN STREET. NIGHT.

A group of "colored" kids hangs out on Main Street near the

police station. They gaze off into the distance at the barred

window of a jail cell. It is elevated half a story above the

street. Everything is black and white except for the warm

YELLOW LIGHT, that glows through the bars. They know in a

glance who's inside.

INT. JAIL CELL. NIGHT.

David sits on his bunk staring at the ceiling. The place has

never been used so there is still plastic wrapping on all the

sheets and pillow cases. He can't help smiling.

INT. DIFFERENT JAIL CELL. WAY OFF DOWN THE HALL ...

Mr. Johnson crouches on his bunk, ignoring his food. He

clutches a rusty nail and scratches at the plaster wall in

true "inmate" fashion.

REVERSE ANGLE. WALL.

Rather than scratching the days or even the hours, Mr.

Johnson has carved a huge pastoral landscape into the wall

complete with lush forest and a running brook. He looks at

his work and smiles.

SHOT. POLICE CHIEF.

He approaches David's cell from the other direction and

knocks gently on the bars. David turns around.

DAVID.

David sits upright on his bunk trying to think who it could

be. After a moment or two, a strange look of understanding

crosses his face. He HEARS the sound of a KEY TURNING IN THE

LOCK. David looks up at the doorway and smiles.

REVERSE ANGLE. DICK VAN DYKE.

He stands in the doorway, still dressed in his TV repairman's

outfit. FOR THE FIRST TIME, HE IS COMPLETELY IN BLACK AND

WHITE.

Dick Van Dyke gives a tight smile and shuts the door of the

cell behind him.

David just looks at him. He smiles, confidently. Leans back

on the bunk ...

Dick Van Dyke takes a deep breath. He glances toward the

barred window.

Dick Van Dyke's eyes go wide and he literally starts to

tremble.

David looks at him uneasily. Dick Van Dyke flashes a broad

nasty smile.

The smile gets bigger. Dick Van Dyke moves closer to him.

David is rocked but tries not to show it.

He taps on the bars for Dan who opens the lock and lets him

out. The door CLANGS shut as the two of them disappear down

the hall. The minute they are gone, the stoicism falls. David

looks around his cell, truly afraid.

CLOSER.

He stares at the tiny cot ... The plain light bulb in the

ceiling ... The single pillow with the plastic covering it

... Forever is starting to look like a long time. David

crosses to the small window and looks out.

HIS POV. OUT THE WINDOW.

Across the town square he can see the side of the Town Hall

complete with the newly painted mural. The "Utopian" view of

Pleasantville is just as he left it with one notable

exception: The edges of painting are starting to turn back to

BLACK AND WHITE.

EXT. TOWN HALL. DAY.

It is bathed in sunlight. Dozens of people stream through the

front door for the first trial in Pleasantville's history.

There is a weird carnival atmosphere in the air.

INT. TOWN HALL. DAY.

The place has been transformed from the Chamber of Commerce

meeting hall to a small town courtroom, complete with pews

and ceiling fans. The only carry over from its previous

configuration is the huge CHAMBER OF COMMERCE banner draped

across the back wall.

ANGLE. BENCH.

At the center of the courtroom where the podium used to be is

a large, elevated judge's bench with a Rotary insignia on the

front. Big Bob sits six or seven feet above the proceedings

finally living up to his name. The whole thing is a strange

combination of Franz Kafka and "Inherit the Wind." Big Bob

bangs the gavel ...

CLOSER.

The undertone begins to quiet down. All of the faces in the

pews are Black and White. There is a "colored" section in the

back for standing room only.

ANGLE. JURORS BOX.

George is seated in the front row of the jury, despite his

relationship to one of the defendants. He is dressed

impeccably with his Rotary Pin still gleaming on his lapel.

After a moment or two he sneaks a glance toward the back of

the room ...

ANGLE. BETTY.

She stands in the back with the rest of the "colored" faces.

Betty cranes her head to catch a glimpse of David or Mr.

Johnson. All at once, a hush goes through the crowd.

ANGLE. DOORWAY.

It swings open and David and Mr. Johnson are led in wearing

handcuffs. Dan, the Police Chief (now ballif), shows them to

a table in the center of the room directly facing Big Bob.

There is no lawyer present. There is also no prosecutor.

ANGLE. DAVID.

He glances around a little confused. (Weird courtroom.) Big

Bob bangs the gavel.

There is a murmur and a great deal of nodding amongst the

black and white faces. Big Bob smiles to himself then

proceeds.

He looks directly at them for the first time.

SHOT. DEFENSE TABLE.

Mr. Johnson just looks at David, confused and terrified.

He gropes for something else to say, but what else is there?

David glances over and sees him sit slowly back in his seat.

David rises from his chair.

David looks out over the audience. After a moment or two, he

looks back at Big Bob.

There is a loud MURMUR. Big Bob bangs the gavel.

He turns and sees his mother in the balcony. They lock eyes

for a moment. David smiles slightly and continues.

There's a murmur in the gallery.

There is a LOUDER MURMUR. Big Bob looks concerned.

He turns suddenly toward the jury box.

Mr. Simpson suddenly looks far away. He gets a kind of dreamy

look in his eye.

CLOSE UP. MR. SIMPSON.

SUDDENLY AND BEFORE OUR EYES, MR. SIMPSON TURNS TO LIVING

COLOR. A huge MURMUR moves through the courtroom. Bob bangs

the gavel.

Big Bob lifts the gavel and is about to bang it when David

suddenly turns toward George.

DIFFERENT ANGLE.

There is a LOUDER MURMUR. Big Bob just looks at him frozen

while David confronts his "father." George straightens up.

CLOSE UP. GEORGE.

He looks at him stunned. Big Bob bangs the gavel but nobody

listens. George just stares at him like he got shot.

George swallows. The UNDERTONE in the room starts to grow as

he glances toward the back of the room.

Slowly, almost imperceptibly George nods. A single tear rolls

down his cheek. As it traces the side of his face it leaves a

long trail of COLOR behind it.

He nods again and it all comes out. Betty smiles at him

through her tears. Even Mr. Johnson smiles as well.

David motions behind him to the black and white section.

There are now ten to fifteen "colored" faces.

He crosses to the bench looking right up at Big Bob. He leans

over the bench and gets right up in his face.

Big Bob starts to tremble. He shakes with rage as David moves

closer.

Big Bob looks at David and starts to tremble. It starts

around the base of his neck, spreads quickly up the rest of

his head. After a moment or two, Big Bob has gone completely

RED IN THE FACE.

WIDER.

A gasp goes through the courtroom. David looks at him and

just smiles. The crowd reaction turns almost to a ROAR as Big

Bob turns and catches his reflection in the window.

CLOSE UP. BIG BOB.

He sees the ruddy image staring back at him, then looks down

at his hands. They have gone completely RED as well. Big Bob

freezes for an instant then bolts from the bench in panic and

flees the room--flinging open the doors to the courtroom.

ANGLE. DOORWAY.

As Big Bob flees, he reveals an amazing sight: the Town

Square GLISTENS IN LIVING COLOR. The huge lawn is a rich deep

green. The sky is a dense opaque blue. Dozens of spectators

bolt from their seats and rush to the doorway as the crowd

moves outside.

EXT. PLEASANTVILLE. (FULL COLOR!)

All the birds are really chirping. Red Brick, Yellow cars,

Green hats ... The barber pole in front of Gus' has finally

turned to red, white and blue--he can't help smiling. David

walks out into the sunlight and stares in wonder at his

creation. The whole town is washed in joy.

WIDER.

Margaret comes up and throws her arms around him. They meet

in a rich passionate kiss (in direct defiance of the code of

conduct). Several people around them actually clap, like

spectators at a wedding. Jennifer moves up next to them and

looks at her brother making out.

David turns and looks at her. Both of them laugh. David

throws his arms around his sister as more and more people

stream out of the courtroom into the sunlight ...

EXT. MAIN STREET. DAY.

David and Jennifer stand together on the edge of town. She

clutches a valise in her hand. He holds the remote control.

WIDER.

They stand on the edge of town (which finally has an edge).

A large sign says: "Springfield 12 Miles" and for the first

time, the end of Main Street is no longer the beginning.

Jennifer is dressed in Mary Sue's clothes with a little bit

of style thrown in. Rich fields of wheat spread out in the

distance.

They both smile.

David nods.

Jennifer nods and gives him a hug. She holds on tight for a

couple of seconds.

David smiles. Never been called cool before. They suddenly

hear the SOUND of a motor and look to their left. A huge

Greyhound bus lumbers up the highway, pulling to a halt at

the sign. The doors open beckoning her in. Jennifer smiles at

her brother, then turns toward the door ...

EXT. MARGARETS HOUSE. DAY.

She clutches her umbrella at her side. David holds a bag of

oatmeal cookies. Each one clings on to the other one's

clothing. Their faces are inches apart.

Margaret nods. She looks at him for a moment then wraps her

arms around his neck. They meet in a long, rich, wet, soft

kiss. The umbrella falls to the ground ...

INT. PARKER LIVING ROOM.

David stands in front of the television with Mr. Johnson at

his side. He holds the remote control in his hand. Mr.

Johnson seems pretty amazed at the whole idea.

Mr. Johnson nods.

He nods again and thinks about it. They smile at each other

one last time.

He pulls out a folded piece of paper. Mr. Johnson extends it

to David who unfolds it and instantly smiles.

INSERT. PAPER.

It is a small painted replica of their mural in the same

vibrant colors. Everything is scaled perfectly, exactly like

the one on the wall.

SHOT. DAVID.

David looks up at him and smiles. All at once he glances

toward the door.

WIDER.

Betty is standing there holding a brown paper bag. A sweater

is draped over her arm.

She looks up at David and their eyes lock. Betty hands him

the bag.

She nods as well. Betty puts the sweater around his shoulders

anyway and fusses with the collar for a second or two. Then

she throws her arms around his neck.

She clings on tight for a second or two then lets go. Betty

flicks away a tear and draws a deep breath.

She steps back and looks at him. David glances down at the

remote.

Betty and Mr. Johnson cross toward the comer of the room.

David points the remote at the TV ...

EXT. MODERN HOUSING TRACT. DAY.

All the ersatz Spanish houses stretch out toward infinity. A

WESTEC security patrol cruises by them at a crawl. A second

or two later, all the sprinklers turn on in uniform

synchronization.

INT. DAVID'S LIVING ROOM.

He stands in the middle of the living room looking at his

new/old surroundings. Everything is the same as it was. The

black onyx coffee table. The clean burbur rug. The big screen

TV in its sleek black cabinet. David looks at it and smiles.

The place is inadvertantly in black and white.

CLOSER.

He reaches forward and turns on the TV (by hand) flipping

around the dial. Jerry Springer is berating a prostitute ...

Tony Robbins hawks self-improvement in an infomercial ...

Court TV is doing an O.J. recap. David unfolds Mr. Johnson's

sketch and glances down at it. He smiles to himself. A

different kind of nostalgia ...
