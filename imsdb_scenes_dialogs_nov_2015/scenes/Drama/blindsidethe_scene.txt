1 OVER BLACK... 1

A distinctly SOUTHERN VOICE...

LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE

There's a moment of orderly silence

before a football play begins.

Players are in position, linemen

are frozen, and anything's

possible. Then, like a traffic

accident, stuff begins to randomly

collide. From the snap of the ball

to the snap of the first bone is

closer to four seconds than five.

2 EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD/GAME FOOTAGE - NIGHT 2

LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE

One Mississippi. Joe Theismann, the

Redskins quarterback, takes the

snap and hands off to his running

back.

JOE THEISMANN hands off to JOHN RIGGINS, who takes two steps

forward, then turns and tosses the ball back'to Theismann.

The footage PAUSES AND PLAYS like a coach breaking down film.

LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE (CONT'D)

Two Mississippi. It's a trick play,

a flea flicker, and the running

back tosses the ball back to the

quarterback.

HARRY CARSON, the Giants linebacker sees that Theismann has

the ball back and races toward him. Theismann steps up and

to the side and Carson flies past.

LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE (CONT'D)

Three Mississippi. Up to now the

play's been defined by what the

quarterback sees. It's about to be

defined by what he doesn't.

LAWRENCE TAYLOR carves a wide circle around the Redskins

lineman trying to block him.

The blocker dives frantically. at Taylor's ankles, and misses.

Taylor leaps, arms raised, filling the sky behind Theismann.

The image FREEZES.

LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE (CONT'D)

Four Mississippi. Lawrence Taylor

is the best defensive player in the

NFL and has been from the time he

stepped onto the field as a rookie.

The frozen image of Taylor comes to life as he jackknifes

Theismann's body.

PLAYERS' FACES react to what they're seeing. Devastating.

TAYLOR pops up from the pile and jumps around like a madman.

LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE (CONT'D)

He will also change the game of

football as we know it.

WE ARE WATCHING the MNF feed and hear the ANNOUNCER'S VOICES.

FRANK GIFFORD (V.0.)

Again, we'll look at it with the

reverse angle one more time. And I

suggest if your stomach is weak you

just don't watch.

LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE

Joe Theissman never played another

down of football.

3 TEAM PHOTO OF THE 2005 SEATTLE SEAHAWKS 3

LEIGH ANNE'S. VOICE

Now, y'all would guess that more

often than not the highest paid

player on an NFL team is the

quarterback.

The camera finds MATT HASSELBECK, Seattle's quarterback.

LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE (CONT'D)

And you'd be right. What you

probably don't know is that more

often than not the second highest

paid player is, thanks to Lawrence

Taylor, a left tackle.

The camera goes to WALTER JONES, Seattle's left tackle.

Because, as every housewife knows,

the first check you write is for

the mortgage and the second is for

the insurance. The left tackle's

job is to protect the quarterback

from what he can't see coming. To

protect his blind side.

4 SERIES OF SHOTS 4

Gurode. Then we SEE SHOTS of their hands, feet, waists,

etc., corresponding with ---

LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE

The ideal left tackle is big, but a

lot of people are big. He is wide

in the butt and massive in the

thighs. He has long arms, giant

hands and feet as quick as a

hiccup.

EXT. WEST MEMPHIS -- DAY 5

A street anchored by project housing and littered with broken

down cars and ne'er-do-wells. Lots of folks out, milling

about, but our focus is on A TEENAGER in the distance, moving

TOWARD US in SLO-MO while everyone else is at normal speed.

He's extremely large, six and a half feet, but he carefully

steps instead of strutting. His name is MICHAEL OHER.

LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE

This is a rare and expensive

combination the need for which can

be traced to that Monday night game

and Lawrence. Taylor. For on that

day he not only altered Joe

Theismann's life, but mine as well.

As Michael continues toward us he begins to go OUT OF FOCUS --

INVESTIGATOR'S VOICE (V.O.)

Mr. Oher, do you know why I'm here?

Mr. Oher?...

MICHAEL (V.0.)

Do you know, do you understand why

I'm here?

MICHAEL (V.0.)

To... investigate.

INVESTIGATOR'S VOICE (V.0.)

Yes. To investigate. I'm here to

investigate your odd...

predicament.

6 INT. NONDESCRIPT ROOM - DAY 6

Looks like a government office. Not much more than a desk on

either side of which sit INVESTIGATOR GRANGER, an African-

American woman in a business suit, and Michael Oher. Michael

slumps a bit, eyes the ground and rubs his hands on his knees

- a nervous trait of his.

Do you find it odd? Your

predicament?

Michael?...

Iono [I don't know]...

Investigator Granger sifts through her briefcase, pulls out

files, documents - a good bit of evidence for whatever

trouble Michael is in.

She sits back, stares at Michael, as if trying to figure him

out. Michael can't meet her gaze. He looks out the window,

rubs his knees some more.

Can I... can I leave now?

No. You can't.

7 INT. ANCIENT FORD TAURUS _ DAY 7

SUPERSCRIPT: TWO YEARS BEFORE

Michael sits in the back seat, behind STEVEN HAMILTON, 14,

and his father, BIG TONY, who drives.

Not a word is spoken as they drive through the streets of

WEST MEMPHIS - poverty ridden.

EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

The Taurus exits into --

9 EXT. SOMEWHAT NICER AREA OF TOWN.- DAY 9

The Taurus passes an endless supply of churches and strip

joints, all of which Michael's eyes take in.

10 EXT. EAST MEMPHIS - INT/EXT TAURUS - DAY (LATER) 10

We've gone from slums to nice neighborhoods - fathers and

sons play baseball, kids tend lemonade stands, sprinklers

keep the grass emerald green.

Michael's face tells us he's never seen anything like this.

11 EXT. WINGATE CHRISTIAN SCHOOL -- DAY 11

A12 INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY -- DAY

Big Tony strides down the almost empty hallway, spots a door.

12 INT. WINGATE - COTTON'S OFFICE - DAY 12

BERT COTTON, football coach, cleans off his desk, ready to

leave for the day. Big Tony knocks at the door.

They say you the coach.

Cotton eyes Tony, offers a hand.

Bert Cotton.

Tony Hamilton, but everybody call

me Big Tony.

What can I do for you, Tony?

13 EXT. WINGATE - SCHOOL GROUNDS - DAY 13

Steven and Michael eye the freshly painted buildings, the

flowers, the new playground jungle gyms and outdoor hoops.

Sure is pretty, huh, Big Mike?

Mike doesn't answer, just takes it all in. Steven sees and

opens a container filled to the brim with balls - footballs,

basketballs, four square balls.

Not even locked!

White people are crazy.

14 INT. WINGATE - COTTON'S OFFICE - DAY 14

Big Tony and Cotton are mid-discussion ---

You see I promised my mama Boo, on

her deathbed, that I would get

Steven outta public and into a

church school.

I appreciate that but I'm not

involved with admissions.

I figured I'd come to you; seeing

as you might need some players.

What sport does he play?

Anything with a ball. Good, too.

He has Cotton's attention for a moment, then it passes...

Classes start in a week. It'd have

to be for next semester.

I know what you're thinking, Coach,

but I got money. I'm a mechanic at

Wilson's Auto t'other side of town.

What if someone drops out or moves?

Could they get in then?

"They?" You only mentioned one son.

Steven, yessir, but I brought

another boy along.

Another boy?

Yeah, Big Mike. He stays on our

couch sometimes. It's a bad deal.

His mama's on the crack pipe and he

ain't got nobody. He just wanted

to come along with us today.

Would... Big Mike be an applicant

as well?

Yeah, sure, why not.

Cotton sighs, considers what to do.

They'd have to fill out

applications and make an

appointment for interviews.

I was hopin' you might just

interview 'em now.

They're here?

Big Tony points out the.window to the playground where Steven

and Michael are playing one on one basketball.

The little ones Steven and the big

Big Mike.

Yeah. That's right.

15 EXT. WINGATE - PLAYGROUND - DAY 15

For a boy his size Michael can really move. He dribbles,

fakes left, then falls away, making a long three pointer.

Cotton's eyes get a little wider as he watches --

Michael dribbles the ball between his legs, behind his back

and jumps high, slamming the ball through the hoop. Big men

aren't supposed to move like this.

Cotton's lips are almost quivering --

Mother of God...

16 INT. ADMINISTRATION OFFICE BOARD ROOM - DAY 16

end, sits Bert Cotton.

Technically, yes, in both grades.

But we have a greater

responsibility than just filling

classrooms. Steven Hamilton's

paperwork looks acceptable and I

believe he would be capable of

succeeding here but the other kid --

Sandstrom looks through papers for the name.

Big Mike.

Michael Oher gives us no reason to

believe, based on his record, that

he would be successful here.

How bad could it be?

Another board member, MRS. SMITH, pores over Michael's file,

which is a mess. She finds facts and lays them out ---

MRS. SMITH

We're not sure exactly how old he

is due to lack of records. He has

a measured IQ of 80. That's 6th

percentile. He's been enrolled in

seven different institutions,

including a gap of eighteen months

around the age of ten when he

apparently didn't attend school at

all. He repeated first grade as

well as second, there's no record

of attendance in third, and in

fourth grade --

So they moved him ahead without

going to third grade. That says

something.

MRS. SMITH

His attendance records are abysmal

and his grade point average begins

with a zero. Zero-point-six-

Silence around the room. MRS. BOSWELL, a board member and

science teacher, looks to the others.

MRS. BOSWELL

Everyone passed him along - gave

him D's so they could hand their

problem off to the next school.

Brave kid.

(off their confusion)

For wanting to come here. For

wanting a quality education. An

education denied him by the poor

quality of the schools he's

attended. Most kids with his

background wouldn't come within two

hundred miles of this place.

MRS. SMITH

Coach Cotton, we understand your

interest in the young man's

athletic abilities.

He wouldn't be able to play until

he got his grades up anyway.

Forget sports! Look at the wall.

He points to the crest on the wall. Beneath it: "NEIGHBORLY,

ACADEMIC, CHRISTIAN".

Christian. We either take that

seriously or we paint over it. You

don't admit Michael Oher for

sports, you admit him because it's

the right thing to do.

Their faces announce that he's made a point.

17 EXT. WINGATE - DAY 17

First day of class. Students, mostly blonde-haired and blue-

eyed, wearing crisply laundered Abercrombie and Fitch, carry

their backpacks through the school's arch and converse with

friends they haven't seen over the summer.

Michael ENTERS FRAME. Fills it up in fact. He stares at the

arch. Beneath the school name we read "WITH MEN THIS IS.

POSSIBLE, WITH GOD ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE". Michael takes a

deep breath and enters. He carries his "school bag" - a

plastic grocery sack.

18 EXT. WINGATE - CAMPUS - DAY 18

Just as before, Michael moves at A DIFFERENT SPEED than those

around him. Makes sense because he is different. Not only

the color of his skin but his size, his clothes (short pants

and T-shirt), his eyes taking in the pavement - all point to

the fact that he doesn't belong here.

Small children from kindergarten and first grade give him a

wide, cautious berth. He's noticed and ogled by everyone.

19 INT. WINGATE - MRS. BOSWELL'S CLASS - DAY 19

It's Mrs. Boswell's biology class and she's writing on the

board in front of a full classroom when Michael enters. He

pauses and all eyes go to him. Mrs. Boswell does her best to

stifle a gasp as she first lays eyes on him. Then...

MRS. BOSWELL

Class, this is Mike Oher and he's

new here so I expect you all to

make him feel welcome.

(with a warm smile)

Mike, take any empty seat.

She urges him with a nod. Michael walks back and sits in the

corner, looking terrified. He barely fits in the seat.

Mrs. Boswell hands out a stack of papers to each row. As

students pass them back to others...

MRS. BOSWELL (CONT'D)

This is a quiz based on the

information you learned last year

in your science curriculum.

Don't worry. It won't be graded. I

just want to see how much of the

information we need to hit again.

Just answer whatever you know.

The student in front of Michael hands a sheet back to him and

eyes the size of his feet.

The students start to work while Michael stares at the sheet

like it's written in Greek. Mrs. Boswell watches him for a

few seconds before turning back to her work.

20 INT. WINGATE - HALLWAY - DAY (LATER) 20

A bell RINGS and kids leave classrooms.

21 INT. WINGATE - MRS. BOSWELL'S CLASS - DAY 21

Michael sits alone while Mrs. Boswell collects the last of

the papers. She walks over to Michael, looks down at his

sheet. Nothing filled in, just his name scrawled at the top.

She tries to decide how to deal with this then opts for --

MRS. BOSWELL

It's okay.

Can I leave now?

She nods and watches him stand and walk away. She glances

down at the sheet, turns it over and sees...

A DRAWING on the back - a boat on an ocean. On the boat is a

single, stick figure person. It's sweet but looks like a

third grader drew it.

22 INT. BIG TONY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 22

Michael lies on a tattered sofa. The lights are out but

Michael's eyes are open, staring at the light emanating from

beneath a closed bedroom door. We hear voices...

WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S)

Why he gotta always stay here?

BIG TONY'S VOICE (0.S)

Ain't got nowhere else.

23 EXT. WINGATE - PARKING LOT - DAY

School is out. Steven walks up to Michael...

Hey, Big Mike, um... my Pops'

girlfriend... she don't really want

you to stay with us no more.

Big Tony's Taurus pulls into the lot.

We can still give you rides if you

want?

Naw, it's aright.

24 INT. WINGATE - GYMNASIUM FOYER - NIGHT

A girl's volleyball game is in progress in the bg. As

latecomers move en masse for entry into the gym, a small

pretty lady on a cell phone moves.against the crowd; a salmon

on a mission. This is LEIGH ANNE Tuohy. And she's pissed.

(on cell phone)

I don't care if Patrick Ramsey did

approve the chair. He's an NFL

quarterback not Martha frickin'

Stewart.

She arrives at the concession stand and waits impatiently.

LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)

There's a difference between Bunny

Williams and Lazee-boy.

Three large popcorns and two large

diets.

When MTV Cribs comes to his house

he'll be showing off his home

theatre but all I'm gonna see is a

brown Barca-lounger. I'm his

designer, my name's on it. Deliver

what I ordered!!!

She hangs up angry, spots a friend nearby and her frown turns

into a smile that could light up a cave.

LEIGH ANNE (CONT`D)

Hi, sweetie! We're on the Kidspace

committee together, aren't we?!

It'll be a hoot!

25 INT. WINGATE - GYMNASIUM -- NIGHT 25

Leigh Anne's husband SEAN TUOHY, handsome, confidant, and

their 10-year-old son, SJ, sit, watching the game.

During a time out, Sean eyes the crowd, sees something odd.

In the upper corner of the gym sits Michael, by himself,

rubbing his knees. Others around him, all white, have moved

away. He's a very large island in the lily white gym.

S.J., you know that kid?

What kid?

Black kid. Up in the corner.

Be goes to high school here. His

name is Big something... Big Mike.

Sean eyes Michael suspiciously.

He look like a volleyball fan to

you?

Leigh Anne, loaded up with refreshments, makes her way up the

stands to her family. She has a nod, a smile, a bon mot, for

everyone she passes. As she sits...

What'd I miss?

Collins got a dig.

It's girl's volleyball, Mom. You

didn't miss anything.

Leigh Anne gives him a look then stands and shouts --

Collins! Move your feet!

ON THE COURT - COLLINS TUOHY, a beautiful 16-year-old, sighs

and gives her mother a look - "Don't embarrass me!"

26 INT. WINGATE - GYMNASIUM - NIGHT (LATER) 26

The scoreboard tells us that the game is over. Fans file

out. The Tuohy family waits in a group as the volleyball

team exits the court.

Collins, we'll wait outside. And

don't double condition in the

shower - you still have homework!

I'm going over to Cannon's house to

study.

Can I go.to the Johnson's for

dinner? They invited me.

What's so awful about our house?

Sean smiles, shakes his head as SJ and Collins leave.

Sean's eyes go to the upper stands where he sees Michael,

alone, walking slowly, then bending down, picking something

up, taking a few more steps and repeating the process.

Picking up left-over bags of popcorn.

Sean considers this for a second before leaving.

27 INT. WINGATE - TEACHER'S LOUNGE - DAY 27

Teachers drink stale coffee and chew on donuts.

FIRST TEACHER (BOB)

Well, the big guy's been here a

month and he ain't cutting it in my

class.

SECOND TEACHER (APRIL)

Why would Admissions do this? It's

not fair to us or the boy.

THIRD TEACHER (GLENDA)

Just setting him up to fail.

I don't think he has any idea what

I'm teaching.

And how would you know if he did?

He won't even talk.

Mrs. Boswell can't contain herself.

MRS. BOSWELL

He writes.

His name. Barely.

Mrs. Boswell goes to'her purse, pulls out a crumpled page.

MRS. BOSWELL

He threw this in the trash can.

(reads from the page)

"I look and I see white everywhere:

white walls, white floors, and a

lot of white people. The teachers

do not know I have no idea of

anything they are talking about. I

do not want to listen to anyone,

especially the teachers.

They are giving homework and

expecting me to do the problems on

my own. I have never done homework

in my life. I go to the bathroom,

look in the mirror and say, "This

is not Michael Oher."

(a pause for effect)

He entitled it "White Walls."

The room is dead quiet.

How's the spelling?

Mrs. Boswell stuffs the page back in her purse and leaves.

28 INT. WINGATE - CAFETERIA -- DAY 28

Sean and Coach Cotton sip coffee while all around them

students eat their lunches. They are looking at Michael, who

sits by himself without a tray in front of him.

If he makes his grades he'll be

eligible in the spring.

If he makes his grades.

But boy-hidey, just look at him.

Cotton is admiring Michael's size but Sean sees something

else. He stands, walks over to Michael, who barely looks up.

What did you eat for lunch today?

Here in the cafeteria.

I didn't ask where you ate, I asked

what you ate.

A few things.

Do you need some money? For lunch?

I don't need any.

Sean walks back over to Coach Cotton.

Buy him a semester lunch pass and

put it on my bill.

(off Cotton's look)

He's hungry.

You could tell that by looking at

him?

give you free lunch, Bert. And

when food is finite, you'd be

surprised how much time you can

spend thinking about it..

29 INT. WINGATE - MRS. BOSWELL'S CLASS - DAY 29

Mrs. Boswell distributes a test to the class.

MRS. BOSWELL

You'll have one hour. If you

finish early put it on my desk and

sit quietly.

She looks at the class as they begin to work, then sees

Michael just staring at his test. She sighs, makes a

decision, rises and walks over.

MRS. BOSWELL (CONT`D)

Mike, come with me.

30 INT. WINGATE - SMALL ADJACENT ROOM - DAY 30

Filled with supplies and a small desk. Mrs. Boswell points

and he sits.

MRS. BOSWELL

You can take the test back here

away from everybody else. I'll sit

in there so if there's anything you

don't understand you can ask.

Michael's eyes go to the page in front of him. He rubs his

hands on his knees and stares. Mrs. Boswell waits a beat

then scoots her chair over next to him.

MRS. BOSWELL (CONT'D)

Mike, how about I ask the questions

and you tell me the answers or as

much as you know.

She looks at his hands - huge next to hers - then reads:

MRS. BOSWELL (CONT'D)

Protozoans are classified based on:

a) how they get their food, b) how

they reproduce, c) how they move,

or d) both a and c.

Michael just stares. After a long moment

Iono...

MRS. BOSWELL

Just try. Ask questions if you

don't understand.

But still Michael stares at the page. The look on her face

says she's about to give up when

He lifts his eyes to her and points to --

-- the question on the test - specifically to the word

"classified".

MRS. BOSWELL (CONT'D)

"Classified". It means how things

are grouped together.

Like our "class"?

MRS. BOSWELL

Exactly. This science course is

classified based on what grade

y'all are in. Eleventh.

Michael nods understanding.

MRS. BOSWELL (CONT'D)

Okay, Mike, you ready to answer the

question?

He looks at her.

31 INT. WINGATE - TEACHER'S LOUNGE - DAY 31

Same group of teachers. Mrs. Boswell bursts through the

door, holding the test.

MRS. BOSWELL

He knows it!

Who knows it and what does he know?

MRS. BOSWELL

The material. Michael Oher. I

gave him this test verbally.

She holds up the test -- marked with a large red "C".

On how big a curve?

MRS. BOSWELL

He's been listening the whole time.

It's amazing what he's absorbed.

And, trust me, he's listening to

you, too. Okay, so his reading

level is low and he has no idea how

to learn in a classroom, but...

(makes her point)

I'm not saying he's going to pass

but Big Mike is not stupid.

32 EXT. WINGATE - CAMPUS - DAY 32

School is out and Michael walks among the kids of all shapes

and sizes. Two little Kindergarten girls'try and swing

themselves. Michael stops nearby, watching them.

They're stuck, not sure if they should talk to this

"stranger". They jump off the swings and run away.

Smile at 'em.

Michael turns to see Si nearby, watching him.

It lets them know you're their

friend. Did you know that even

little kids born blind smile?

They've never seen anyone do it

before but they smile anyway. So

it's universal. That's why it

works. Not that you should fake it

or anything... You're Big Mike,

right?

Sean holds. out a fist for Mike to "knock" and the two walk

toward the school entrance.

I'm Sean, but everyone calls me Si --

that's for Sean Junior because my

father's name is Sean. Sean Tuohy.

He was a basketball star at Ole

Miss, point guard, and now he owns

like a million Taco Bells.

Leigh Anne's car pulls up to the pick up/drop off and Si

starts toward it.

Manana'.

Michael smiles at the kid, who smiles back.

33 INT. LEIGH ANNE'S CAR - DAY 33

Leigh Anne notices Michael as she drives past him.

Who's that SJ?

Big Mike.

Get your feet off my dash.

34 EXT. WINGATE - PICK UP/DROP OFF - DAY 34

Michael watches Leigh Anne's car disappear.

SANDSTROM (O.S.)

Big Mike?...

Michael turns to see Paul Sandstrom, the principal.

35 EXT. WINGATE - DAY (A FEW MINUTES LATER) 35

Michael and Sandstrom sit on a bench.

Mike, I just got a call from

someone at the police department.

(off Michael's look)

Do you remember the story in the

papers awhile back about the man

who fell off an overpass?

(Michael shakes his head)

No one knew who he was and they're

not sure if he jumped, or if... at

any rate he passed away.

Sandstrom struggles with how to say the words.

Mike, the man... was your father.

Michael takes this in. without showing emotion.

They've been looking for someone to

notify and came across your name on

our registry. I'm really sorry,

son.

Were you close?

(Michael shakes his head)

When did you last see him?

Iono.

I'll try and find out where he's

buried. Maybe we could go visit?

Michael nods, then rises and walks away.

36 EXT. ANOTHER STREET - DAY (LATER) 36

The Blind Side -- Yellow Draft - 04/15/09 22

38 INT. LAUNDROMAT - NIGHT 38

plastic sack, pulls out an extra T-shirt and starts to wash

it.

A WOMAN, the only other patron, reads a magazine. When he

turns to look at her, she becomes quite nervous. She sets

down the magazine and walks outside.

It seems Michael was expecting this because as soon as she

leaves he takes his wet T-shirt, wrings it-out, walks to her

dryer and tosses the shirt inside to dry with her things.

39 EXT. LAUNDROMAT - NIGHT (LATER) 39

Michael sits in the corner, his head resting against the

window, trying to sleep.

40 EXT. WINGATE - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT 40

A banner over the arch reads: THANKSGIVING PAGEANT TONIGHT!

Kids in costume - Pilgrims, Indians, turkeys - race out the

door to greet their proud parents. Si, in an ornate

headdress looks for and spots Sean and Leigh Anne waving.

They walk away together toward the parking lot.

41-42 OMITTED 41-42

43 INT. SEAN'S BMW - PARKING LOT - NIGHT 43

As they exit the parking lot--

Turn on the heat!

I don't know where it is.

It's fifteen degrees, you've had

this car a month and you don't know

how to turn on the heat?!

(as she turns it on)

What would you do without.me?

Lots of things you'll never know

about.

They trade a look and a smile. Sean puts a.hand on her lap.

Get a room.

Si, don't let this go to your head

but I thought you were very

convincing in the role of... uh...

Indian Number Three. I tried out

for the Chief but they gave it to

Andy Sung. I can't be sure but I

think there was some multi-cultural

bias thing working.

Or maybe they just thought he'd

make a better Chief.

Dad, he's like Chinese.

And you're Irish. If you weren't

the Chief how come you got the

headdress?

Si hesitates a bit before --

Dad, I'm gonna need a few more of

those free Quesadilla tickets.

And where does the acorn fall?

Don't laugh too hard. The

Quesadilla saved our ass.

A44 EXT. STREET - NIGHT A44

Sean's car stops at a red light and Michael crosses in front

of them, wearing just his shorts and short sleeved shirt.

B44 INT. SEAN'S CAR - NIGHT B44

Leigh Anne notices Michael --

B44 CONTINUED: B44

What is he wearing? It's below

freezing. What's his name again?

SEAN AND SJ

Big Mike.

Where's he going?

She gives Sean a look. Sean rolls down his window.

Hey, Big Mike!

Michael stops in the crosswalk, looks to the car.

Where you headin'?

Gym.._.

Sean nods, rolls his window back up and drives as the light

turns green.

The gym? It's nine o'clock.

No answer to this. They drive another half block,before --

LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)

Turn around.

Sean sighs, knowing better than to argue.

44 EXT. STREET - NIGHT 44

The BMW pulls to a stop alongside Michael. Leigh Anne gets

out, walks up to Michael.

Big Mike, my name is Leigh Anne

Tuohy. My kids go to Wingate. You

said you're going to the gym?

Michael slowly nods.

LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)

The school gym's closed.

Michael takes this in but doesn't respond.

Why were you going to the gym?

(again no answer)

Big Mike?! Why were you going to

the gym?

Because... it's warm.

This hits her all at once. She bites her lip.

Do you have anywhere to stay

tonight?

Michael eyes the ground, then nods.

LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)

Don't you dare lie to me.

45 INT. SEAN'S BMW - NIGHT 45

Sean and SJ watch the discussion without hearing any of it.

Leigh Anne looks to Sean, then back to Michael.

I've seen that look many times.

She's about to get her way.

Leigh Anne makes her way back to the car, with Michael in

tow. She opens the back door and he gets in next to SJ in

his headdress. Leigh Anne climbs into the front seat, closes

the door. Sean is looking at her.

Where we going?

Home.

46 EXT. RITZY NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT 46

47 INT. SEAN'S BMW - NIGHT 47

a mansion. Hell, it IS a mansion.

48 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT 48

Collins, in her pjs, talks on the phone while watching TV and

listening to the stereo. She wears a tangerine cleansing

masque on her face. When the family enters behind her --

How'd the dork do in the play?

She turns to see... Sean, Leigh Anne, SJ in headdress and

Big Mike.

Um... okay...

49 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (LATER) 49

Leigh Anne lays out pillows, sheets, blankets on the couch.

I'd give you the guest bedroom but

it's full of sample boxes. And the

sectional in the family room slides

apart when you sleep on it. At

least that's what Sean says.

Mr. Tuohy sleeps on the couch?

Only when he's bad. There's a

powder room right there and we're

upstairs if you need us.

The two share a look, then...

LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)

Sleep tight, honey.

She leaves. Michael is dumbfounded, stares at everything in

the room, then sits on the couch.

Psst...

SJ is in the doorway to the kitchen.

If you can't sleep, my room is the

first one at the top of the back

stairs. I got X-Box, Madden,

everything.

Michael nods then smiles. SJ smiles back, gives a thumbs up

and disappears. Michael's eyes go to a coffee table book

NORMAN ROCKWELL. On the cover is "FREEDOM FROM WANT" -

picturing a family sitting around a dinner table.

50 INT. TUOHY HOUSE -- SEAN AND LEIGH ANNE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 50

They lie in bed, awake.

Was this a bad idea?

What?

Don't lie there and pretend you're

not thinking the same thing as me.

Fine, tell me what you're thinking

so I can know what's supposed to be

on my mind.

How well do you know Big Mike?

In case you haven't noticed he

doesn't have much to say. What's

the big deal? It's just one night.

(after a beat)

It is just one night, right?..

Leigh Anne?...

Do you think he'll steal anything?

I guess we'll know in. the morning.

He rolls over to go to sleep. Leigh Anne just sits, stares.

51 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - SEAN AND LEIGH ANNE'S BEDROOM - DAY 51

Leigh Anne finishes teasing her hair. Sean rides an exercise

bike. Before she leaves the room...

If you hear a scream call the

insurance adjustor.

52 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - COLLINS' BEDROOM - DAY 52

Leigh Anne enters Collins' bedroom. Very "teenage girl" but

a mess - clothes everywhere. Leigh Anne opens the curtains

throwing light into the room.

Up and at 'em.

Collins groans. Leigh Anne picks up a few pieces of clothes.

on her way out and groans at the mess. We stay with her as

she re-enters the hallway, walks and opens the door to --

53 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - SJ'S BEDROOM - DAY 53

Just as messy but not all clothes. Leigh Anne almost trips

on a series of wires connecting games to a large screen TV.

Sean Junior!

She opens the shades.

LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)

Clean this place up before you come

downstairs. You hear me?

Si crawls out of bed and Leigh Anne exits the room and starts

down the stairs, almost afraid of what she'll find.

54 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 54

The couch is totally back to normal and the sheets, blankets

and pillows are neatly stacked in almost military precision.

No sign of Michael.

Mike? Big Mike?!

Nothing. She hears a DOG BARKING in the neighborhood and

moves to the window to look out.

55 EXT. TUOHY HOUSE - DAY 55

Michael, plastic sack in hand, walks away. Leigh Anne exits

the front door, spots Michael and tries to catch up.

Big Mike!

He stops, turns. Leigh Anne walks over.

LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)

Where are you going?

Iono.

Are you spending Thanksgiving with

your family?

Michael shakes his head.

56 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - KITCHEN -- DAY (LATER) 56

Leigh. Anne carves turkey onto a tray and takes it into...

57 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM -- DAY 57

Leigh Anne sets the turkey on a serving table alongside the

rest of the Tuohy Thanksgiving feast.

Come and get it!

Sean sits at the TV,"watching an Ole Miss football game,

while SJ plays.video games on another. Collins chats on her

cell. Michael sits off to the side, taking it all in.

SJ, Ole Miss is about to score!

Which means they're about to

fumble.

They all shuffle over, grab plates, start piling on food.

Sean loads his plate and heads back to the couch.

Looks great, hon.

Collins plate is pretty delicately apportioned.

I see a lot of starch.

SJ jams turkey into a roll and lathers on cranberry sauce -

creating an easy to eat sandwich. He walks away.

Michael stares - he's never seen so much food. Leigh Anne

hands him a plate. He gingerly puts a slice of.turkey on it.

As much as you want.

Oh, the potato salad!

With no one watching him, Michael shoves two rolls into his

pants pocket and finishes filling his plate.

Leigh Anne reenters to see Michael sitting at the dining room

table, alone, not touching his plate.

Her eyes go to the rest of her family, shoving down food and

playing games. She makes a decision, grabs the remote and

turns off the TVs.

58 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY 58

The entire family sits at the table. Rockwell would be proud.

Why are we eating in here?

Leigh Anne holds out her hands.

Shall we say grace?

The Tuohy family plus Michael hold hands.

Collins stares at her tiny hand intertwined with Michael's.

As Leigh Anne prays Michael tries to emulate behavior without

closing his eyes, taking it all in...

LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)

Heavenly Father. We thank you for

all your many blessings on this

family. We thank you for bringing

us a new friend. And we ask that

you look after. us in this holiday

season and never let us forget just

how very fortunate we are. Amen.

A chorus of Amens and they all dig in. Michael is unsure at

first how to correctly use the silverware. He picks up the

fork and Leigh Anne nods, "that's right". She eyes Michael's

stained shirt.

Big Mike, do you like to shop?

(off his look)

Because tomorrow I think I'm gonna

have to show you how it's done.

59 INT. LEIGH ANNE'S CAR -- DAY 59

Leigh Anne drives and Michael sits shotgun.

I qot clothes.

You "have" clothes.. And an extra T-

shirt in a plastic bag does not a

wardrobe make.

He looks out the window.

and puts it in park.

Tell me everything I need to know

about you.

He still stares out the window.

LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)

Who takes care of you?

A mother? Do you have a mother?

A grandmother maybe?

Nothing. Leigh Anne turns off the car.

LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)

Look, Big Mike, we can do this the

easy way - or we can do it the hard

way. Take your pick.

He eyes the floor.

LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)

Fine. Tell me one thing I should

know about you. One thing!

After a beat...

I don't like to be called Big Mike.

She wasn't expecting this, nods her head.

Okay. Mike or Michael?

(off his shrug)

Tell you what, from now on, to me,

'you're Michael. So,... Michael,

where we headed?

60 EXT. HURT VILLAGE HOUSING PROJECT - DAY 60

An expansive beehive of rotting housing. It's the place we

saw when we first laid eyes on Michael and nothing's changed.

Leigh Anne's car stops at one of the complexes.

This is where your mother lives?

He nods and she opens her door.

LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)

Okay, let's go.

He forcefully reaches across her and closes the door,

catching her off guard.

Don't get out!

Who's going to help you with your

clothes?

Don't get out of the car.

Michael gets out on his side and takes care to push the lock

before he closes the door.

She watches as he walks toward the structure, then notices

several of the local ne'er-do-wells eyeing her. she locks

the doors again, just for luck.

61 EXT. HURT VILLAGE - DAY 61

Michael walks slowly past a few gang-bangers on the steps.

The obvious leader, ALTON, eyes him.

Big Mike! Where you been?!

Michael ignores, keeps walking.

And who's that fine piece o' thing

driving you around?

One of Alton's minions, DAVID, sits nearby. Michael sees

him, nods.

Hey, David.

David, a little embarrassed to be with Alton, nods back.

62 EXT. HURT VILLAGE - DIFFERENT APARTMENT - DAY 62

Michael arrives at an apartment and stops, taken aback. On

the door is an EVICTION NOTICE and padlock.

He reads from the eviction for several seconds.

An Addict down the way fires up and slumps into bliss.

A63 EXT. HURT VILLAGE - MINUTES LATER A63

With Leigh Anne's car in the bg., Michael, hidden from view

slumps against a wall, looking lost - the first real emotions

we've seen from-him.

63 INT. LEIGH ANNE'S CAR - DAY (LATER) 63

She watches as Michael approaches the building with nothing

in his hands, and makes his way back to the car. She unlocks

it and he crawls inside. After a pregnant moment...

She wadn't home.

We can come back.

Michael takes this in, looks out the window.

She prolly moved to a nicer place.

64 EXT. BIG AND TALL SHOP - DAY 64

Wrong side of the tracks. Michael and Leigh Anne cross the

street toward the shop.

I've lived in Memphis my whole life

and never been anywhere near here.

You're going to take care of me,

right?

I got your back.

That's good to know. Thank you.

As they start to walk, Leigh Anne reaches up and takes

Michael's arm. He holds it out for her.

65 INT. BIG AND TALL SHOP - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 65

An AFRICAN AMERICAN SALESMAN directs Leigh Anne and Michael.

Everything I got to fit him will be

-right here.

This is it? If this is all you got

why's it say "Big and Tall" on the

sign?

Big and Tall. You need "Bigger and

Taller".

He walks away. She starts to pore through the small rack.

Anything you like?

The one thing I know about shopping

is that if you don't absolutely

love it in the store, you won't

wear it. The store is where you

like it best.

And before you choose something

think about yourself wearing it and

ask yourself: Is this me?

She finds one shirt, holds it out.

LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)

What about this?

He shakes his head, "no".

LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)

This isn't atrocious.

He shakes his head again. After a beat he points.

almost laughs.

LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)

This one? This is the one you

like?

He nods, completely sure.

66 EXT. WINGATE - DAY 66

Drop off area. Leigh Anne's car pulls up and SJ, Collins and

Michael get out.

Have a great day. Learn something!

They say a few good-byes, get out and walk toward the arch.

Only then do we see what Michael is wearing: a GARGANTUAN

ORANGE AND MAROON STRIPED RUGBY SHIRT.

Leigh Anne shakes her head, watching him walk away. A car

behind her HONKS. She checks the rear view mirror --

LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)

Don't get your panties in a wad.

67 INT. TONY RESTAURANT - DAY 67

Ladies who lunch. The right sort doing their thing. Leigh

Anne sits at a table with three friends, BETH, ELAINE and

SHERRY. They sip on lemon water and nibble at salads.

The best part about Paris was the

food.

They use sauce like we use gravy. I

had to join a gym the day'we got

back.

Any of y'all spent much time on the

other side of town?

On the freeway.

Where exactly are you talking

about?

Alabama Street... Hurt Village.

Hurt Village -- that sounds like a

threat.

You're not far off.

It would "hurt" me to go there.

It would certainly hurt your

reputation to go there.

(tongue in cheek)

I'm actually from there but didn't

mind hard work and look where I am

now.

Eating an eighteen dollar salad.

And it's a little soggy to be

honest.

Such a shame.

(re: her salad)

Yes it is.

Civil rights was responsible for

some good things but those programs

- building ugly, low cost housing.

I mean how could you be creative if

you lived there? It's stifling.

Did you know that black men were

employed at a higher rate before

those programs? It's a fact.

They're not "black", Elaine. The

term du jour is African-American.

And what if they're from Jamaica,

or like Bermuda.

Then they're BerMUDian-Americans.

They all cringe and laugh.

So, why are you asking about the

projects, Leigh.Anne? Another one

of your charities?

A project for the projects. That's

catchy. Money would raise itself.

(off their laughs)

Don't laugh. Count me in, Leigh

Anne.

68 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT 68

SJ and Michael sit at the island doing their homework.

It can't be that hard.

Oh, yeah?...

Si looks at the Michael's notebook.

There are different parts of a

sentence and you just have to draw

lines showing what they do.

Sean stops by the refrigerator for a cold drink while he

talks on his cell...

They're gonna get rid of those

stores in Florida... I'll look it

over now but I need the sales

figures by tomorrow morning.

Dad, you remember how to diagram

sentences?

Nah.

Sean starts to leave, then stops at the door, turns around,

sighs and walks over. He leans in over Michael.

Let's see...

You don't have to help.

(off Sean's. look)

I mean if you're busy or somethin'.

I know.

(points to page)

Think of a sentence like a football

team. This is a noun here, see?

That's like the team name or what

they're known for - whether they're

a running team or a passing team.

And this is the verb. That's what

makes 'em go - like a star player --

maybe a quarterback, maybe a

running back. And this is an

adjective - everybody oohs and ahs

over adjectives but they're not as

important as verbs.

They're like wide receivers.

Or kickers.

Michael just stares at them.

You have no idea what we're talking

about, do you?

Not exactly.

They all laugh.

Leigh Anne watches, fixated on the image of the three. Sean

has an arm on Michael's shoulder. She smiles, almost sadly.

69 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT (LATER) 69

Leigh Anne hands over clean sheets and pillows to Michael,

who starts to make the bed.

Do you want to stay here, Michael?

He keeps working.

LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)

Because if you want to... stay...

for awhile... longer... I'll try

and find some time to figure out a

bedroom for you.

He stops, turns to her. She walks over, examines the

structure of the couch. It sags a bit.

LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)

I mean, look at this, you've

practically ruined a.ten thousand

dollar couch.

She moves closer to him. Her face softens.

LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)

Do you want to stay here, Michael?

I don't want to go anyplace else.

She's a bit befuddled by the response.

Well,... alright then.

70 INT. WINGATE - BOARDROOM - DAY 70

Leigh Anne sits in a chair reading through Michael's file.

I see here on the admission that

we're Michael's contact for medical

emergencies?

Mrs. Smith (from the admissions meeting) sits with her.

MRS. SMITH

Sean wrote that in last week. We

needed a contact number and the

ones listed weren't in service.

Love that man.

Leigh Anne pulls out another sheet, hands it over...

LEIGH ANNE (CONT`D)

What's this?

MRS. SMITH

The state makes schools measure for

career aptitude in eighth grade. It

came with his'file.

They try to figure out what a kid's

going to be in the eighth grade?

What does. it say about Michael?

Mrs. Smith nods and reads over Michael's results.

MRS. SMITH

Doesn't look promising. Spatial

relations - third percentile..

Ability to learn - fifth

percentile.

(sees another number)

It's funny though. He tested in

the 98th percentile in one

category.

Which one?

MRS. SMITH

"Protective instincts."

Leigh Anne smiles and hands the file back.

MRS. SMITH (CONT'D)

It's just so sad.

Leigh Anne considers this, then...

Yes, it is sad. So sad. But he

either doesn't know it or doesn't

think so and it's my job, and your

job, to make sure he doesn't find

out.

(off Mrs. Smith's look)

Michael Oher doesn't feel sorry for

himself and I'll be damned if he

starts to because of the way we

treat him.

(again off her look)

"Darned."

71 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - MICHAEL'S BEDROOM - DAY 71

Now turned into Michael's room, with an armoire, a chest of

drawers, night stands, the whole nine yards. The bed is a

massive futon in an ornate stand.

Leigh Anne and Michael stand in the doorway.

I had to put half my samples in

storage but well, anyway, back

there's a desk.

(points as she talks)

Chest o'drawers. Night stand.

Lamps. Alarm clock. Bed. Sean

says a lot of pro athletes use

futons if they can't find a big

enough bed.

Michael doesn't dare touch anything, just stares in awe.

LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)

Well, try it out. See if it feels

okay.

He gingerly moves to the bed; touches it.

(off his look)

What?

Never had one before.

A room to yourself?

A bed.

We can see this unsettles her. She turns away a bit, trying

to contain herself.

Well, you got one now.

72 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY 72

73 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - SEAN AND LEIGH ANNE'S BEDROOM - DAY 73

She.closes the door behind her, sits on the bed and starts to

tear up. She fights it unsuccessfully.

74 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY 74

OUTSIDE THE DOOR

Michael stands, unsure what to do.

75 INT. WINGATE - ADJACENT ROOM - DAY 75

Mrs. Boswell gives Michael - in a RED AND BLUE RUGBY SHIRT -

an oral test...

MRS. BOSWELL

Define Osmosis, Michael.

I think I know that. It's when

water...

76 INT. WINGATE - MRS. BOSWELL'S CLASS - DAY (LATER) 76

77 INT. WINGATE - HISTORY TEACHER'S CLASSROOM - DAY 77

Name the combatants in the battle

of Waterloo.

I know that. The little guy,

Napoleon was on one side and...

78 INT. WINGATE - GLENDA'S CLASSROOM - DAY (LATER) 78

79 INT. WINGATE - SCHOOL CAFETERIA - DAY 79

Michael, in another rugby shirt, this one BLACK AND YELLOW,

carries a tray and sits with SJ, who starts laughing.

What?

Enough with the rugby shirts. You

look like a giant bumble bee.

Collins walks by with friends and glances but ignores them.

Who's the big guy hanging around

with your little brother?

Just another one of Mom's projects.

That must get incredibly old.

Collins' look says, "yes it does."

81 INT. WINGATE - BOB'S LITERATURE CLASS -- DAY (LATER) 81

Bob grades Michael's paper. He writes "D".

82 INT. SEAN'S BMW - NIGHT 82

The whole family, including Michael, rides in the car. SJ

points out fast food restaurants along the way --

That Taco Bell. The KFC catty

corner. The Long John Silvers on

the next block.

You own all of 'ern?

Yeah. We've got hundreds.

A hundred and fifteen.

Is that why Mr. Tuohy don't have to

go to work?

Hey, hey now. I'm working even

when I'm not working.

And y'all eat at those places for

free?

All you want. It's awesome.

What do y'all do with the leftover

food? At the restaurant?,

Well, we have to throw some of it

away. What's already been cooked.

That's too bad.

Yeah, I'd rather sell it.

Seems like you could give it away

or something? You should check

into that, Daddy.

Leigh Anne and Sean share a look and a smile.

All right, I will.

Why ain't we eatin' at one of yours

tonight?

.Because tonight is a special

occasion.

What?

I talked to Coach Cotton today.

Michael's grades improved enough

that he can do spring'training for

football in March.

Isn't that great?

Oh, man, you are gonna crush some

people!

Michael almost smiles, a little unsure.

83 EXT. FANCY RESTAURANT - NIGHT 83

Sean's car pulls up to the valet. As the family gets out

Leigh Anne notices a bookstore next door and starts for it.

I've got a design book I need to

get. Sean, go check on our

reservation.

They'll seat us when we walk in the

door. You can get the book after

dinner.

(already walking away)

They might be closed by then.

I need some new magazines.

SJ shrugs and joins the girls, as does Michael. Sean watches

as his family deserts him.

84 INT. BOOKSTORE - NIGHT 84

Leigh Anne finds the book she's looking for and walks through

the stacks looking for her kids, plus Michael. She finds

them all together in the children's section, laughing.

Come on, your dad's already PO'ed.

Collins holds up a book. Sendak's WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE.

Remember this one, Mom? You read

it to us like a thousand times.

She softens, walks over, takes the book.

"And he gnashed his terrible teeth

and roared his terrible roar.-

I always liked this one.

He holds up THE STORY OF FERDINAND.

Yeah, me too.

Leigh Anne sees Michael left out, but interested.

LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)

Michael, your Mama ever read either

one of those to you?

He just stares at her, the answer obvious.

LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)

No one ever...

85 EXT. FANCY RESTAURANT - NIGHT 85

The Tuohy family exits and waits for the valet.

Now that was a good steak.

Thanks, Daddy.

Thanks.

You're welcome.

As the car pulls up everyone walks toward it except Michael

who notices something else --

AT THE SIDE DOOR: A BUSBOY steps outside for a smoke.

Michael absently walks over.

SEAN (CONT`D)

Michael?...

Leigh Anne touches Sean's arm, silencing him. They watch as --

Michael greets the busboy. They stand a few feet apart

talking. They nod at each other and after a few seconds --

They hug.

Leigh Ann is amazed. She's never seen affection in Michael.

86 INT. SEAN'S BMW - NIGHT (MINUTES LATER) 86

As they drive home.

Who was that boy you were talking

to, Michael? At the restaurant.

Marcus.

He works there?

Yeah.

And how do you know Marcus?

He's my brother.

Complete silence in the car. Leigh Anne finally breaks it --

Well, I'd like to meet him someday.

Would that be okay with you?

I don't know where he stays.

When's the last time you saw him,

Michael?

When I was little mebbe.

87 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Collins sits on the floor in the hallway near a door, smiling

sadly and secretly listening to ---

LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE

"Once upon a time in Spain, there

was a little bull --"

A88 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - MICHAEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - SAME

A strange sight. Leigh Anne, SJ and Michael all sit on

Michael's huge futon as Leigh Anne reads THE STORY OF

FERDINAND. No one enjoys this more than Leigh Anne...

"...and his name was Ferdinand.

All the other little bulls he lived

with would run and jump and butt

their heads together, but not

Ferdinand. He liked to sit just

quietly and smell the flowers"...

88 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - SEAN AND LEIGH ANNE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Leigh Anne and Sean sit in bed. Sean puts his book on the

night stand and leans over to give Leigh Anne a kiss. He

notices her smile...

Huh?

Why are you smiling?

I don't know. I'm just happy.

Really happy.

Does. this happiness have anything

to do with Michael?

No. It has everything to do with

Michael.

Sean smiles, kisses her, turns off the light. She snuggles

next to him and kisses the back of his neck.

Oh...

He gets the message, rolls over and kisses her on the lips.

Happy's good.

As their amorous activities continue...

I think we should start a charity.

For kids like him.

(his mind elsewhere)

Sure, okay.

Maybe fund a program at Wingate.

Absolutely...

Are you even listening to me?

I try to concentrate on one thing

at a time.

You knew I was a multi-tasker when

you married me.

She kisses him and they roll over, laughing.

89 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 89

The Tuohy family, dressed nice, poses in front of a blue'and

red artificial Christmas tree adorned ENTIRELY WITH OLE MISS

ORNAMENTS. They are posing for a photograph.

Okay, big smiles everyone!

FLASH! Leigh Anne smiles but notices ---

Michael sitting on the couch by himself.

Michael! Come over here and get in

the next one.

Sean gives her a look like she's crazy.

LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)

We don't have a single picture with

him.

(off Sean's sigh)

Oh, come on. It's not like I'm

gonna put it on the Christmas card.

Michael moves in behind the family, dwarfing them.

Okay, really big smiles. One, two,

three... say Rebels!

THE TUOHY FAMILY CHRISTMAS CARD - INCLUDING MICHAEL

90 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - DAY 90

New Year's Day. Sean, Si and Michael watch football.

Collins sits on the couch reading. Leigh Anne comes in the

front door with groceries.

Who's winning?

Tennessee.

Too bad. Who are they playing?

So you root against Tennessee no

matter who they're playing?

Yep. With gusto.

She can't stand Tennessee.

Collie-bell, I thought you were

going to your boyfriend's?

I'm just gonna hang around here

today.

I like that.

Coupla messages on the machine.

She pushes PLAY on the message machine.

Hey, Leigh Anne, it's Patrick

Ramsey.

A91 INT. WASHINGTON REDSKINS LOCKER ROOM - DAY A91

You sent me these measurements for

clothes and I posted 'em in the

locker room for donations but

there's a problem.

The Blind Side - Yellow Draft -- 04/15/09 52

A91 CONTINUED: A91

I mean, are you sure the sizes are

right, because there's nobody on

our team who's that big? Gimme a

call.

BACK TO SCENE:.

B91 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - DAY B91

Leigh Anne chuckles as the next message begins --

Hey, Sean, hey Leigh Anne, it's

cousin Bobby. Happy New Years!

C91 INT. COUSIN BOBBY'S HOUSE - DAY C91

Bobby sits in his recliner, talks on phone...

Listen, I've had about five cold

ones so'I'm just gonna go ahead and

ask... Who's the colored boy in

y'all's,Christmas Card?

BACK TO SCENE:

D91 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - DAY D91

Leigh Anne and Sean look at each other and laugh.

ELAINE (V.0.)

Leigh Anne, you looked teeny-tiny

next to him.

91 INT. TONY RESTAURANT - DAY 91

Leigh Anne sits at a table with her lunch buddies. They're

finishing up and are all laughing hard except Leigh Anne.

It was like you were Jessica Lange

and he was King Kong.

I taped your card to, the fridge.

The next morning Frank almost

gagged on his orange juice.

Does Michael get the family

discount at Taco Bell? Because if

he does Sean's gonna lose a few

stores.

More laughter.

Look, he's a great kid.

I say just make it official and

adopt him.

Big laughs at the "crazy" idea.

He'll be eighteen in a few months.

(off their confusion)

So, I mean it wouldn't make much

sense to legally adopt him, right?

They realize she's thought about it and stop laughing. After

an awkward beat of silence...

Is this some kind of white guilt

thing, Leigh Anne? I mean

charity's the Lord's work but...

What will your daddy say?

Before or after he turns over in

his grave? Daddy's gone five years

now, Elaine, and to make matters

worse you were at the funeral. You

wore Chanel with that awful black

hat.

Before Elaine can attack --

LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)

Look, here's the deal. I don't need

any of y'all to approve of my

choices. But I do ask you to

respect them. You have no idea

what this boy's been through.

91, CONTINUED: 91

And if this is going to be a

running diatribe I can find an

overpriced salad a lot closer to

home.

I'm so sorry, Leigh Anne. We

didn't intend to --

No, we didn't, really --

I mean, what you're doing is so

great. To open your home to him.

You're changing his life.

Leigh Anne smiles to herself, realizing...

No. He's changing mine.

That's awesome for you, but... what

about Collins?

What about Collins?

Aren't you worried, even just a

little?

(off Leigh Anne)

I mean he is a boy, a large, black

boy, sleeping under the same roof.

Leigh Anne stares at them, shakes her head then grabs the

I've got this.

(rises; to the group)

Shame on you.

And strides away.

92 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - COLLINS' ROOM - NIGHT 92

Collins is reading in bed. Leigh Anne knocks, enters and

sits on the edge of the bed.

Is Michael being here weird for

you?

They're stupid kids, who cares what

they say.

What kids?

At school. They're juvenile.

And what do the juvenile kids say?

It's really not worth repeating.

And don't worry about SJ - he loves

the attention. He introduces

Michael as his big brother.

What about you?

It's fine.

(off Leigh Anne's look)

I mean, you can't just throw him

out on the street.

I can make other arrangements.

(off Collins' hesitance)

Just let me know. Okay?...

Leigh Anne kisses Collins goodnight.

93 EXT. WINGATE - PLAYGROUND - DAY

before, sitting in the swings. He smiles. They smile back.

FIRST LITTLE GIRL

Hi Mike.

Hi. Need a push?

They giggle and Michael pushes them, one arm each until

they're flying high and squealing.

Collins watches.

94 INT. WINGATE - LIBRARY - DAY 94

Collins is sitting with her friends, laughing and whispering.

She notices Michael enter and walk to a table with a book.

He sits alone while every other table is full.

Collins sighs, makes up her mind and stands with her books.

Where are you going?

Collins walks away toward Michael.

Collins?

They are aghast when they see Collins set down her books

across from Michael and sit.

AT MICHAEL'S TABLE

Michael is confused. She looks at him and shakes her head.

Quit looking at me like that. I

mean, we study together at home.

Eyes in the library are on the pair as they start to read.

95 EXT. WINGATE -- PRACTICE FIELD - DAY 95

Several players, in full gear, drag equipment out onto the

field under the watchful eye of Bert Cotton. Sean Tuohy sits

in the nearby stands.

Michael carries four blocking dummies to the center of the

field and tosses them like they're pillows. Cotton smiles.

You know how much those things

weigh? This kid's gonna make us

all famous.

Easy, Bert. It's only the spring

and he hasn't even been through his

first practice.

96 EXT. WINGATE - PRACTICE FIELD - DAY

Michael is lined up at defensive tackle. The offense breaks

the huddle and Michael just stands there. He notices the

other defensive linemen get in a stance and kind of squats a

bit. When the ball is snapped he just holds his hands out,

keeping the blocker from getting close to his body.

The running back races right past him and into the secondary.

THE WHISTLE BLOWS and Cotton races up to Michael.

Okay, Mike, you fought off the

block but you've got to shuck him

and make the tackle. You got it?

Michael gets down in a his stance and when the ball is

snapped he gets under the blocker and lifts him up like WWF.

The quarterback goes back to pass and sees Michael lumbering

toward him with the lineman on his shoulders.

The Quarterback's eyes go wide and he races out of the pocket

and throws and incomplete pass. ANOTHER WHISTLE.

Shuck the blocker, Mike!

Michael gingerly sets the lineman on the ground.

IN THE STANDS

Leigh Anne shows up, sits next to Sean.

How's he doing?

Doesn't quite have the hang of it

yet.

SERIES OF SHOTS:

No!

skyward as a flock of birds flies overhead.

No! No! No!

97 EXT. WINGATE - PRACTICE FIELD - DAY (AFTER PRACTICE) 97

As players leave the field, Bert Cotton walks and talks with

Leigh Anne and Sean...

Most kids from bad situations can't

wait to be violent and that comes

out on the field. But this kid, he

doesn't seem to wanna hit anyone.

(almost to herself)

He's Ferdinand the Bull.

What?

Nothing.

I thought for sure he was gonna be

a player. I can't believe I used

up my chits to get him in school.

I thought you said it was your

Christian duty?

He gives her a smirk.

Look, Bert, he's never even played

before.

And he won't in the fall if he

doesn't improve a lot before then.

98 EXT. WINGATE - PRACTICE FIELD - DIFFERENT DAY 98

Si, holding a sheet and wearing a whistle, stands before

Michael. No one else'is around.

This is your summer workout sheet.

First it says to warm up and get

loose.

(off Michael's look)

Well, go ahead, get loose.

Michael moves his arms around a bit then stops.

You loose?

Okay, next is five one hundred yard

runs to stretch out your legs.

Michael grimaces.

Let's go home, play some video

games.

Look, everybody at. Wingate is

expecting you to be a star football

player. You don't want to let them

down, do you?

Iono..

What about Dad and Mom?

(off Michael's look)

'Cause you see, in our family,

everyone's an athlete. Dad was a

basketball star, Collins plays

volleyball and runs track. Me, as

you know, I do it all and Mom,...

well, Mom was a cheerleader, which

doesn't exactly count but don't

tell her I said that.

99 EXT. WINGATE PRACTICE FIELD -- DAY

SERIES OF SHOTS - DIFFERENT DAYS:

the dummy and sending Si flying.

whistle and Michael collapses on the ground - dead tired.

100 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - LEIGH ANNE'S WORKSPACE - NIGHT 100

Leigh Anne goes through sample boxes and matches swatches.

Mrs. Tuohy?

Michael stands nearby.

I hear "Mrs. Tuohy" I look over my

shoulder for my mother--in-law. Call

me Leigh Anne or Mama or almost

anything else.

Will you help get me something?

What?

Driver's license.

Why do you need a driver's license

when you don't have a car?

You have a car.

That I use to haul y'all all over

creation with.

He doesn't say anything but doesn't leave either. Leigh Anne

puts down the swatches, turns to him..

LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)

Why do you want a license, Michael?

Something to carry. With my name

on it.

She locks eyes with him. This time he holds her gaze.

DMV EMPLOYEE (V.0.)

Address?...

101 INT. DMV OFFICE - DAY 101

Leigh Anne and Michael sit across from a DMV EMPLOYEE typing

on her computer. Leigh Anne holds out her driver's license.

Is this his address as well?

Yes. He lives with us.

Are y'all his foster parents?

No.

His legal guardians?

oh... no.

The Employee does a search on the computer. As she types...

Does he have a Social Security

card?

Leigh Anne looks to Michael, who shakes his head.

DMV EMPLOYEE (CONT'D)

Birth certificate?

We tried to find one for school,

but...

DMV.EMPLOYEE

You don't know which city, which

county, which hospital?...

How big a problem is this?

DMV Employee looks to Leigh Anne.

There's nobody named Michael Oher

in the system. Another last name

perhaps?

Leigh Anne again turns to Michael, who shrugs.

Look, I'll sign something saying he

lives with us and we'll pay for the

insurance; whatever it takes.

(off her look)

What's it gonna take?

Off the Employee's look --

102 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - SEAN AND LEIGH ANNE'S MASTER BATH - NIGHT 102

As they get ready for bed. Sean rinses his mouth --

You wanna do what?!

Don't pretend you didn't hear me.

Shouldn't we at least talk about

it?

What do you think we're doing? And

don't act like I'm going behind

your back. I know you put us down

as his medical contact at school.

There's a big difference between

paying for a broken arm and being

legally responsible for someone.

Someone we barely know.

And that's another thing. We have

to find out more about his past.

He won't talk about it. He's like

an onion; you have to peel it a

layer at a time.

Not if you use a knife. What if we

sent him to a child psychologist?

Do you really expect Big Mike --

-- expect Michael to lie down and

talk about his childhood like he's

Woody Allen or something? Michael's

gift is his ability to forget.

He's mad at no one and doesn't

really care what happened in the

past.

This puts her on her heels.

You're right.

(like he's never heard

Excuse me? "You're right?"

(off her grimace)

How'd those words taste coming out

of your mouth?

Like vinegar.

She moves to him, holds him.

At least promise me you'll think

about it.

Alright.

"Alright" you'll think about it or

"alright" we should do it?

Is there a difference?

103 INT. CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES OFFICE DAY 103

Leigh Anne sits in a crowded waiting area, talking on her

cell phone. She's been here awhile.

Just tell Rodney to hold the

chiffonier for me and I'll get by

after while.

She hangs up and, exasperated by the wait, rises and walks

a counter, pushing past someone --

LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)

I'm not cutting, just asking.

I've been waiting for over an hour

and I look around and all I see is

people shooting the bull and

drinking coffee. Who runs this

place anyway?

The "heard it all" EMPLOYEE points to the wall with a

government seal and a large portrait of President Bush.

LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)

Well I'd have it in shape in two

days, I can tell you that.

I'm sure you would. How can I help

you?

She turns to the man waiting behind her.

He was first.

MAN IN LINE

No, you go ahead. I think I. want

to hear this.

Me, too.

I do not appreciate the attitude.

Ma'am, you can tell me what you

want or I'll make sure you wait all

day. How. Can. I. Help. You?

I'd like to become a legal

guardian.

Lord look over that child.

104 INT. CRAMPED OFFICE - DAY

A haggard MANAGER, let's call him RONALD, sits across from

Leigh Ann. He looks at a flimsy file.

There's very little on Michael.

Most of his files have been lost.

What is in there?

A few case notes.

(holds one sheet up)

This one describes an incident

where officers forcibly removed

Michael and six half-siblings from

Denise Oher's care when Michael was

seven. Quite a scene evidently.

They had to split up the kids. And

it's far from the worst.

Where is she? His mother?

Dunno, but if you find her we have

a bunch more files we could add to.

(CONTINUED.)

How many children does she have?

At least a dozen, probably more.

With her drug arrest record my

guess would be she can't even

remember.

Leigh Anne absorbs this.

We'd need her permission though,

.right?

No. Michael is a ward of the

state. Just apply and get a Judge

to sign off on it.

So you would give him away without

even telling his mother?

Ronald shrugs.

105 EXT. HURT VILLAGE - DAY 105

Looks the same as before except for the'blonde woman walking

between the buildings.

Leigh Anne spots and checks a list of tenants posted. She

can barely see through the cover as someone has scrawled "C

Block" on it.

106 EXT. HURT VILLAGE - DAY 106

The one Michael visited before. Leigh Anne summons her

courage and knocks on the door. And again. No answer.

A VOICE comes from the apartment behind her --

MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

Who you lookin' for?!

Startled, Leigh Anne turns and sees Alton approaching...

I'm looking for Denise Oher.

Dee Dee don't stay there no more.

Do you know where she might be?

Chances are she ain't gone far.

I seen you before. You with Big

Mike now. You wanna come in for a

wine cooler or sumthin'?

No, I can't, but thank you.

107 EXT. HURT VILLAGE - PLAYGROUND - DAY 107

Leigh Anne speaks with a mother trying to keep her son from

hurting himself on a rusty slide. The mother points to

another building.

108 EXT. HURT VILLAGE - BUILDING E -- DAY 108

A door opens revealing DENISE OHER in a ratty robe.

Hi. Mrs. Oher?

You from the state?

No. My. name is Leigh Anne Tuohy and

your son Michael lives with me.

And my family.

Denise takes this in.

109 INT. HURT VILLAGE - DENISE'S APARTMENT - DAY (MINUTES LATER) 109

Leigh Anne sits on the edge of a filthy couch and eyes.the

room. There are sleeping pallets on the floor and empty wine

and beer bottles strewn around.

DENISE OHER (O.S.)

How is my boy, how's Big Mike?

He's fine. He's doing well.

(after a beat)

When did you move from the other

building?

wig on her head, making herself "presentable."

Awhile back. This is temporary.

Friends let me stay here.

When did you last see Michael?

Iono. We might have some wine in

the kitchen, if...

No, no that's very kind but...

How many foster kids you got living

with you?

Oh, I'm not a foster parent to

Michael. We were just helping him

out.

State don't pay you nothing?

No.

And he lives with you?

(Leigh Anne nods)

And you feed him?.

Buy him clothes, too?

When I can find them in his size.

You a fine Christian lady.

I try to be.

This is all real nice what you're

doing, but don't be surprised if

one day you wake up and he gone.

. 69

What do you mean?

He's a "runner". That's what the

state called him after they took

him from me.

(off her look)

Every foster home they sent him to,

he'd slip out the window at night

and come looking for me. No matter

where I was that boy would come

find me, take care of me.

I've had some . health problems.

Mrs. Oher, was Michael born under a

different name?

Denise tries to remember. After a few seconds...

Proctor. That was his Daddy's last

name.

Where is he, the father, if you

don't mind me asking?

Ain't. seen him since he left.

And when was that?

Week after Mike was born.

Do you have Michael's birth

certificate?

Denise sighs, looks around at the mess, shakes her head. And

then, unexpectedly, starts to cry softly.

LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)

It's okay, Mrs. Oher.. I'll figure

it out.

Leigh Anne walks over, kneels and takes Denise's hands.

You'll always be Michael's Mama.

Would you like to see him?

No... Not this way.

People lose birth certificates.

It's nothing to be ashamed of.

It's Williams.

(off Leigh Anne's look)

His last name's Williams. Couldn't

even remember who the boy's father

is.

Leigh Anne bites her lip'and puts her arms around Denise, who

hugs back.

110 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY 110

The entire Tuohy family sits with Michael at the table.

Michael, we have something to ask

you.

What?

Leigh. Anne and I would like to

become your legal guardians.

What's that mean?

Well, what it means is, we want to

know if you'd like to be a part of

this family?

Michael looks to a grinning SJ, to Collins who nods and

smiles, then to Leigh Anne...

I kinda thought I already was.

Leigh Anne feels a wave of emotion, nods to him, then races

away to go and gather herself.

Michael looks to Sean for an explanation. Sean shrugs

can't explain her to you."

111 A CAMERA FLASH (IN DMV OFFICE) 111

When it clears we see MICHAEL'S FACE - on a DRIVER'S LICENSE.

112 EXT. TUOHY HOUSE - DAY

Michael, blindfolded, is led outside by the entire family.

When Leigh Anne pulls if off, Michael gasps at the sight of -

A NEW TRUCK in the driveway.

Is that the one you wanted?

He just stands there, staring. Sean hands him the keys.

Well, hell, take it for a spin.

(off Michael's look)

Go on.

Can I go, too?

okay, but Michael?...

(off his look)

Be careful.

Michael smiles and he and SJ get inside the truck.

He wanted a truck?!

Michael thinks he's a redneck.

113 EXT. WINGATE - PARKING LOT - DAY

Michael drives up in his new truck, parks it carefully.

At the drop off Big Tony's car sputters away, leaving Steven

at the curb. Steven notices Michael and walks over, eyeing

the truck.

Tenth grade tough?

Naw.

(points to truck)

This really yours?

Yeah.

They just give it to ya'?

Yeah.

After a beat...

You're right. white people are

crazy.

And they walk off together to class.

114 INT. WINGATE - BOB'S LITERATURE CLASS - DAY 114

You are now seniors.

Congratulations. But with that

distinction comes responsibility.

This will be one of your tougher

courses because my job is to

prepare you, at least most of you,

for the rigors of college Freshman

English. You are each holding a

class study guide which details

assignments. I won't remind you

what is due and when. Read the

materials and come prepared. At

the end of the year you will each

choose one of our literature

assignments and present a written

dissection of the piece.

The faces in the classroom tell us this is a tough course.

115 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY 115

Dozens of.condiment jars and bottles are lined up on the

table. SJ has the football playbook open and is explaining

formations to Michael.

See, you're the ketchup, here at

Left Tackle. On the weakside.

I'm not that weak, SJ.

it just means there are more

blockers on the other side. It's a

compliment, really.

A compliment for a condiment.

Good one.

(back to work)

So the first play is simple.

"Gap." It just means you block

whoever is in front of you, or the

person on your inside shoulder if

you're not covered by a defender.

(points to condiments)

I'll be the running back and you

show me what you're supposed to do.

Ready... . Hike!

SJ, using both hands, moves Cayenne pepper back a bit, then

"hands off" to Cinnamon who "runs" toward Michael (Ketchup).

Michael moves the bottle forward, pushing back Mustard, then

Relish, as well as toppling a bottle of Vanilla Extract.

Open lane to the end zone. All

there is to it.

Si slides Cinnamon forward. The bottle flies off the end of

the table and crashes on the ground just as --

Leigh Anne walks down the stairs, purse in hand --

What is going on here?!

Cinnamon just scored.

We're going through the playbook.

Michael got moved to offense..

Well, when you're finished, put the

players back in the spice cabinet.

No problem. Actually, Mom, we were

waiting for you. The new Madden

came out and me and Michael want to

go get it.

Honey, I've got a meeting in ten

minutes.

I'll drive.

off her look --

116 INT. MICHAEL'S TRUCK - DAY 116

Michael drives while SJ searches for music on the radio.

Look for Walker Street. That's

where we take a left.

Si finds a hip-hop station and they both groove to the beat,

dancing in the seats.

117 EXT. INTERSECTION - SAME 117

THE-truck CRASHES into the side of a VAN.

118 INT. RUG SHOP - DAY 118

Leigh Anne, with a client, is looking at rugs with the owner.

This is not a twenty thousand

dollar Oushak, Jerry. The borders

are different widths, it's been

altered.

Leigh Anne's phone rings. As she answers

LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)

We'll give you nine tops.

Hello ...

The look on her face changes --

119 EXT. INTERSECTION - DAY 119

A massive traffic jam. Leigh Anne pulls her car right onto

the median, gets out and starts running. She passes stopped

cars and weaves past bystanders on her way to:

THE COLLISION INTERSECTION

As she approaches she sees -- Michael's truck -- the front end

is smashed -- The Van - its side caved in -- And --

Michael sitting on the curb, crying. She races over --

Michael!

He looks up, sobbing.

I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry!

Where's SJ?!

Go help him! Please go help him!

Leigh Anne turns to see a group of PARAMEDICS kneeling around

a body. She gasps, races over and looks down at --

Si, whose face is bloody. He spots Leigh Anne and sits up.

Mom, do you think the blood will

come out of my shirt?

An airbag deploys at 200 miles per

hour. Your son's too small to sit

in the front seat.

He's okay, though, right?

Busted lip, some facial bruising.

When an airbag strikes a child his

size it usually means a fractured

face, a broken neck or worse. It's

almost like the airbag started at

him then changed direction.

Defective or something. Very, very

lucky.

Leigh Anne nods thanks and looks to Michael, still on the

curb, eyes on the ground. She walks over, kneels down.

Michael, it wasn't your fault. It

could have happened to anybody..

He doesn't look up. She almost gasps when she notices --

HIS ARM - red, bleeding, a large burn from the wrist all the

way up to the sleeve, which is also singed.

LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)

Michael, your arm... what happened?

He looks up and into her eyes...

I stopped it.

120 EXT. WINGATE - STANDS/PRACTICE FIELD - DAY

video with live action].

ON THE FIELD: Michael skips to the line and gets down in his

stance. On the snap Michael pushes the tackle, JAY COLLIS,

who rolls, gets by Michael and makes the tackle.

0her! You've got a hundred pounds

on Collis and you can't keep him

out of our backfield?!

IN THE STANDS

Leigh Anne sits down next to SJ.

What's. with the camera?

Michael does better when he can see

what he's supposed to be doing.

ON THE FIELD

The quarterback drops back to pass. Michael backpedals. When

the Defender tries. to go around him, Michael grabs him.with

one big paw and throws him to the ground. A WHISTLE BLOWS.

Holding - left tackle!

He gets right in Michael's face, grabs his jersey.

You can only grab in here -- at the

tits, you got it?! You grab out

here or here, we're gonna get

flagged and I'm gonna get pissed.

Leigh Anne grimaces, shakes her head.

At the snap of the ball Michael tries to pass protect, pushes

the Defender who tries left, right, then slides past Michael

and sacks the quarterback.

Move your feet, son! Keep 'em

moving! Back to the huddle!

Cotton addresses an ASSISTANT COACH...

Well at least he'll look good

coming off the bus. The other team

will be terrified 'til they realize

he's a marshmallow.

As they chuckle, Leigh Anne strides past, onto the field.

Gimme a minute, Bert.

We're in the middle of practice,

Leigh Anne!

You can thank me later.

Bert just watches as Leigh Anne walks straight to the huddle

and pulls Michael aside. The other players turn to watch.

LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)

Do you remember just after we met,

and we went to that horrible part

of town to buy you those dreadful

clothes?

And I was a little scared and you

told me not to worry, that you had

my back?. Do you remember that?

Yes ma'am.

If anyone tried to get to me you

would have stopped them, right?

And when you and Si were in that

car wreck, what did you do to that

airbag?

I stopped it.

Leigh Anne points to the offense.

This team is your family. And you

have to protect them --

(points to defense)

--from those guys.

She walks over and grabs the QB, pulls him out.

LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)

Tony is your quarterback. You

protect his blindside.

When you look at him, think of me.

How you have my back. How you have

his.

She grabs BOBBY, a short stump of a running back.

LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)

oomaloompah here is your tailback.

When you look at him think of SJ

and how you'd never let anything or

anyone hurt him. Do you understand

me?

What about Mr. Tuohy and Collins?

I suppose they can be on the team,

too. Are you going to protect the

family, Michael?

He nods. She nods back and walks away, past Bert Cotton.

LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)

Yelling at him won't help. He

doesn't trust men. In his

experience they pretend to care

about you 'til they disappear.

Cotton chuckles.. She walks over and sits next to SJ, who has

the video camera in his lap.

LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)

You're gonna wanna get this.

INTERCUT VIDEO AND LIVE ACTION:

on another while Tony completes a pass.

away, clearing an alley for Bobby to blast through.

Bert shakes his head, turns to Leigh Anne --

What'd you say to him?

(off Bert's look)

I told you you.could thank me

later.

(a beat for effect)

It's later, Bert!

Thank you, Leigh Anne.

121 EXT. WINGATE - STADIUM -- NIGHT

IN THE STANDS: Sean, Leigh Anne and SJ take their seats and

check out the raucous crowd.

So much for home field advantage.

You ever seen so many rednecks in

one place?

Nascar, not even close.

122 INT. WINGATE - LOCKER ROOM -- NIGHT

Coach Cotton is addressing his team before the game.

On the schedule it says this is a

home game but don't be deceived,

gentlemen. Three fourths of the

people in the stands are here from

Milford. They'll be loud and rowdy

and a lot of 'em drunk. Keep your

helmets on 'til you're on the

sidelines. I don't want anyone

getting beaned with a whiskey

bottle.

Grab a knee.

And the team huddles for their prayer...

For we can...

(team repeats each phrase)

Do all things...

Through Jesus Christ...

Who strengthens us...

Each and every day...

And may God... Bless the Crusaders!

As they rise to leave--

Oh, one more thing. The reason

Milford traveled all that way to

come here is they expect to whup

your ass. Whup your ass and have a

party in your house. Whup your

ass, have a party in your house and

piss on your mama's new couch. Is

that gonna happen?

The team erupts with a chorus of NO'.s and HELL NO!s.

123 EXT. WINGATE - EDGE OF STANDS - NIGHT 123

As the Wingate Crusaders exit the dressing room they find

themselves next to the Milford Lions ready to take the field.

The cocky Milford players eye the Crusaders.

Hey, Crusaders, y'all gonna turn

the other cheek or just bend over?!

Another Milford player, #66, spots Michael.

Would y'all look at the size of

that buck!

Milford takes the field. Jay Collis, to Michael...

Pay 'em back on the field.

Coach Cotton raises a hand and the team moves forward to

squeeze through an entrance onto the field. Above them

Milford fans look down and jeer, toss sodas at them.

The Blind Side -- Yellow Draft - 04/15/09 82

124 EXT. WINGATE - STADIUM - NIGHT 124

Damn, that ain't fair! They got a

big ole' black bear playing for

'em! What is this, a circus?!

IN THE STANDS

Leigh Anne, Sean and SJ cheer as Wingate runs onto the field.

A chorus of BOOS comes from the stands behind them.

MILFORD DAD (CONT'D)

There's the Lions and here come the

Christians!

SJ turns and gives a dirty look --

SJ, eyes forward! Sticks and

stones...

ON THE FIELD

The ball is kicked off and Bobby, the Crusaders tailback

takes it in at the five yard line. He makes one player miss

then is dragged down by a swarm of defenders at the twenty.

Let's go 0!

Number 66 from before is the defensive end on Michael's side.

Wingate breaks huddle and #66 sees him.

At the snap #66 sidesteps Michael and sacks the QB.

(as he walks by Michael)

All night long, fat ass. All night

long.

IN THE STANDS

Leigh Anne and Sean share a look and cheer on the team.

The Blind Side - Yellow Draft -04/15/09 83

Come on, Michael!

ON THE FIELD

Wingate breaks huddle and as they get into their stances #66

calls a switch. He moves inside and the linebacker moves

outside. Michael looks at the move, confused.

Hut! Tony, the Wingate QB starts to drop back but hands off

the ball on a draw to BOBBY, the Oompaloompah.

Michael, unsure which player to block, just stands there

while they both crush Bobby.

The Milford players high five and both give Michael a

shoulder as they pass him.

NEXT PLAY - BALL SNAPS

Michael hits #66 square in the numbers, putting him on his

heels. But he's quick as a cat and jumps to bat down a pass.

Fourth down !

The crusaders offense leaves the field. #66 follows behind

Michael, taunting him.

And don't come back unless you want

me to embarrass your black ass!

66 laughs and struts away. Cotton goes straight to the ref.

Did you hear what he said? Are you

gonna just let that kinda talk go?!

Ever heard of the First amendment,

Coach? Get back to the sideline.

Cotton takes a deep breath, then turns to Michael, who has

been beside him the whole time.

Look, son, 66 is quick, so just

focus on his belt buckle.

Where it goes he goes. And block

'til the whistle blows. All right?

Michael nods and takes a seat on the bench. Cotton hears

something and realizes it is his cell phone. He looks at the

number calling. and answers...

Hello?...

IN THE STANDS

Leigh Anne is on the phone.

Enough with the trick plays, Bert.

Just run the dang ball.

Bert, on the field, turns to the stands, shakes his head

hangs up angrily.

Behind the Tuohys, the Milford fans are in a frenzy.

That's my boy Jimmy, number 66. He

is kicking that blue gum's ass!

Leigh Anne can't restrain herself. She rises, turns

Hey crotch mouth! Yeah, you! Zip

it or I'll come zip it for ya!

Sean pulls her back down to her seat.

Sticks and stones?

ON THE FIELD

The Milford offense is moving the ball

the corner and runs all the way to the end zone. The

scoreboard reads: "HOME 0 VISITORS 7".

ON THE SIDELINE

Bert Cotton gathers his forces.

It's all right. Settle down.

ON THE FIELD

The Crusaders have the ball at the twenty. They break from

the huddle, get over the ball and the play starts. It's a

sweep left and Michael pulls to lead for Bobby. 66 fends off

Michael and keeps moving, forcing a pileup near the sideline.

Michael and Bobby are at the bottom of the pile.

66 extricates himself from the pile and gives Michael a

little kick as a cherry on top.

Big black pile of nigger crap!

Cotton is nearby, hears this, races straight over to the Ref.

Ref, you gonna do something about

this?! He kicked my boy in the

head and cussed him!

The Ref throws a flag.

Thank you!

Unsportsmanlike conduct on Wingate!

Fifteen yards. Shut up or you'll

get another fifteen.

What happened to the first

Amendment?!

Cotton throws his hat and another ref throws a flag.

This young man plays for my team

and I will defend him like he's my

own son! Against you or any other

redneck sonofabitch!

Michael watches, dumbfounded. He walks over to the livid

Cotton and pulls him backwards, looks him in the eye.

Don't worry, Coach. I got your

back.

Cotton cools down. Michael trots out onto the field.

Halfway there he stops, looks back at Cotton and smiles.

Second and 38.

IN THE CRUSADERS HUDDLE

Michael looks to Tony.

Try Gap.

Coach called a pass.

Gap.

AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE

As Wingate lines up, 66 is at it again.

66 but the damage isn't over as Michael now has him "in the

Bobby races through the hole and into the secondary --

Michael keeps pushing 66 back, picking up speed until 66 is

airborne save every third step of Michael's when he touches a

toe to the ground like a ballerina --

Bobby cuts to the sideline --

Michael is running full speed with 66 now and he keeps going

past the sideline--

Past Collins and the rest of the cheerleaders while --

Bobby makes the opposite corner and heads for the end zone ---

Si is on his feet, filming Michael --

Michael keeps going, past the track and toward the fence

separating the field from the parking lot --

Just as Bobby races into the end zone --

Michael chucks 66 into the air. 66 hits the fence hard and

As he passes Collins she gives him a high five.

Way to go big bro!

A referee signals touchdown then notices Michael walking back

and 66 lying slumped at the fence.

The Ref throws a flag.

Now what?! Was he holding?

Uh, no.

Did he hit after the whistle?

I don't believe so.

Then what's the flag for?

I dunno... . Excessive blocking.

You're kidding me.

The Referee ignores and returns to the field to assess the

penalty. 66, now on his feet, limps back onto the field.

Michael looks at him and 66's eyes go straight to the dirt.

Cotton walks up to Michael.

Sorry, Coach. I stopped when I

heard the whistle.

Where were you taking him, Mike?

To the bus. It was time for him to

go home.

Cotton smiles proudly and slaps Michael on the ass.

Attaboy, Michael Oher. Attaboy!

IN THE STANDS

Leigh Anne stands and turns to face the Milford fans

See number seventy-four? Well,

that's MY son.!

The Milford fans don't know what to make of this. Leigh Anne

sits down with a self-satisfied smile.

ON THE FIELD - A SEQUENCE:

his place. The SCRUB, terrified, looks to Michael.

AT THE SNAP the Scrub flinches and hits the dirt. The play

goes to the other side and Michael reaches a hand down to

help the Scrub up and to his feet.

12 5 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - SJ'S ROOM - DAY

Si has the video of Michael up on his computer. A "burned

DVD" pops out and SJ puts it in a distinctive case.

126 INT. TOM LEMMING'S RECRUITING OFFICE - DAY

A hub of activity. Move past a SECRETARY answering phones --

Tom Lemming Recruiting, please

hold... Tom Lemming Recruiting,

please hold...

And land on TOM LEMMING, the foremost college talent

forecaster in the country.

TOM LEMMING .

Did the monthly recruiting updates

get mailed?

Coach Saban wants his Fed Exed.

Does he really think getting it one

day early is gonna give LSU a leg

up?

An ASSISTANT hurries up.

Have you filled all the slots for

the Army All Star Game?

Yeah, why?

The assistant hands over the distinctive DVD marked MICHAEL

OHER - THE TERMINATOR!

You might want to open one up.

127 EXT. SEAN'S OFFICE - DAY 127

Lemming walks along with Sean and Coach Cotton toward Sean's

office.

Every year there are a dozen

running backs in the high school

ranks who will make it to the NFL.

Quarterbacks maybe three or four.

But left tackles, true left

tackles, they're freaks, gifts from

the gods. A great one only comes

around every four or five years.

Mike's the best I've seen in ten.

You're kidding?

I don't kid about guys who'll get

fifty million or more to play

football.

And you think that could be

Michael?

Oh, yeah. The embarrassing thing

is it's my business to know every

prospect in the nation but if you

hadn't sent me that DVD I would

have never heard of him.

What DVD? I didn't send a DVD.

You're Sean Tuohy, right?

Sean "gets it", trades a look with Cotton.

Si.

128 INT. WINGATE - SEAN'S OFFICE - DAY 128

They arrive at an empty office where Michael sits. He stands

and Lemming eyes him like a piece of meat...

Wow. Just wow.

Lemming breaks out a measuring tape and smiles.

129 INT. WINGATE - SEAN'S OFFICE/HALLWAY/OUTSIDE THE DOOR - DAY 129

Tom Lemming runs the biggest

recruiting service in the nation.

He practically created an industry.

Every college coach subscribes to

his newsletter. One word from him

and... This is big, Sean.

130 INT. WINGATE - SEAN'S OFFICE - DAY 130

Lemming sits across from Michael...

Mike, I came all the way from

Chicago just to see for myself.

And now that I have, I'd like to

extend to you an invitation to play

in the Army High School All

American game at the end of the

season.

He places an application on the desk. Michael stares at it.

131 INT. WINGATE - SEAN'S OFFICE - DAY (A FEW MINUTES LATER) 131

The door opens and Lemming comes out shaking his head.

I don't want to offend but... does

Mike have special needs?

Well, he eats a lot.

No, I meant, is he mentally... off?

No, no, he's just...

Shy. Really shy.

Because the only thing he said to

me was "No." Said it three times;

every time I asked him if he'd like

to play in the Army All Star game.

I get lobbied by every player,

every father, every coach to get

into this game.

(hands over application)

Let me know if he changes his mind.

Lemming walks away. After he's gone, Michael emerges.

Why didn't you fill out the

application, Michael?

Leigh Anne notices Fulmer.

LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)

What in the world?...

(to the squad)

Y'all keep practicing.

She strides toward the football practice field.

139 EXT. WINGATE - PRACTICE FIELD - DAY 139

Leigh Anne arrives to see a group of coaches, all wearing

shirts and hats emblazoned with school logos. They chat and

watch as the Wingate football team finishes calisthenics.

One ASSISTANT COACH, from. Southern Miss, sees Fulmer racing

up.

SOUTHERN MISS COACH

Shoot, man, Fulmer's here. I might

as well go home.

Fulmer smiles at the assembled coaches, shakes a few-hands.

Drove all the way from Knoxville to

come see for myself.

Leigh Anne slides in near the group so she can eavesdro

CLEMSON ASSISTANT COACH

Heck, I drove from Clemson, that's

nine hours!

Bert cotton walks over, shakes Fulmer's hand, leaving the

other coaches shaking their heads.

Coach Fulmer, it's a real honor.

Coach Cotton I been keeping an eye

on your program. Y'all doing a

fine job down here. Wouldn't be a

bit surprised to see you coaching

at the next level real soon.

Cotton's smile tells us he'd like that a lot.

FULMER (CONT`D)

Is that him? Is that O'Hair?

It's Oher. Like a paddle in a

boat.

Fulmer notices Leigh Anne, grunts then turns back to Cotton.

If you could run him through a few

drills, we'd sure appreciate it..

.Cotton gives Leigh Anne a look that says, "get out of here."

She shakes her head -- "I'm not going anywhere."

Cotton blows his whistle and the team approaches.

Board drill. Big Mike and Jay

Collis. Best on best.

An Equipment manager lays out a plank and Jay Collis sighs

and lines up, one foot on either side of the board. Michael

slowly moves into position opposite him.

The coaches all inch closer and crane their necks to see.

Leigh Anne is now right in the middle of them. Fulmer gives

her a look that says,,"Who the hell are you?"

Cotton blows his whistle, Michael fires out and it's over in

an instant. Collis is pancaked under Michael, who gets up

and offers a hand.

The coaches are frozen - as if they've witnessed a miracle.

(almost to himself)

Force equals mass times

acceleration.

Then, all at once, the coaches pull out their cell phones and

start poking digits and jabbering: "You won't believe it!"

"You gotta see this!" "He's a freak of nature!"

The Clemson coach strides away.

Where are you going, Coach?

Back to South Carolina. I've seen

more than enough. If he can qualify

with his grades you tell Michael

Oher that Clemson wants him.

Good luck with that, Brad!

Fulmer smiles wide then turns to look once more at Michael.

front of her. Sean walks in, takes in the sight.

Did you know that to be eligible

for a Division One scholarship

Michael's gonna need a 2.5 GPA?

Really?

His ACT is low and I don't see him

doing any better if he retakes it.

What's his GPA now?

1.76.

Not bad really, when you consider

where he started.

He needs to make A's this year.

(off Sean's laugh)

I'm serious. And that might not

even be enough.

So he goes to Junior College.

Most inner city kids that go to JC

drop out in a year. His shot at

the pros would go out the window.

Pros? Are we even sure he's gonna

get college offers?

She walks over to the answering machine, presses "Play."

ON THE MACHINE

Hello, my name is Nick Saban and

I'm the head football coach at

Louisiana State University...

(Leigh Anne fast forwards)

Tommy Tuberville, Auburn

University...

(fast forwards again)

We're very interested in having

Michael over to Knoxville for a

visit.

Phil Fulmer, from Tennessee?

There are twenty more.

She holds up a stack of mail - envelopes and Fed Exes.

LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)

And these. Fifty of 'em.

Any from Ole Miss?

They won't recruit until they hire

a new coach. But none of it

matters unless he makes his grades.

So, what do we do?

141 INT. WINGATE - TEACHER'S LOUNGE - DAY 141

Leigh Anne speaks to the assembled teachers.

So here's the plan. E-mail me all

assignments and let me know what

Michael has to do to make an "A".

There is laughter in the room.

LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)

Okay, fine, a B plus. And if

anyone knows of a good tutor I'd

love to hear about 'em.

MRS. BOSWELL

I think I know someone.

142 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 142

Leigh Anne sits with MISS SUE, a no nonsense prospective

tutor wearing an Ole Miss sweatshirt.

I understand that you applied for a

teaching position at Wingate?

I wasn't religious enough for 'em.

I'm a spiritual person, Mrs. Tuohy,

but I have certain,. shall we say...

doubts.

I appreciate your honesty, Miss

Sue.

What's the situation with Michael?

He needs to do better in school.

Obviously. But why the big push?

He's in line for a football

scholarship if he gets his grades

up.

Is he considering Ole Miss?

He'd better be.

I'd love to work with him.

When do you want to start?

Mrs. Tuohy there's something you

should know about me. I don't tell

many people, but it's something I

feel you should be aware of before

you hire me.

What's that?

I'm a Democrat.

143 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - KITCHEN -- NIGHT (LATER) 143

AT THE TABLE

Michael stares at a problem in Geometry book, then...

I don't understand it.

Yet. You don't understand it yet.

How big is your head, Michael?

Big.

And what's in there?

A brain.

A brain. Full of knowledge - like

a file cabinet with maps; shortcuts

for figuring things out. You will

learn this, Michael Oher because

I'm here to help you use those maps

and reach your destination. Like

Sacagawea helped Lewis and Clark.

Sacagawea?

We'll get to that. And the history

books have it wrong, but all you

need to you know is that I'll get

you there. Do you believe me? Do

you trust me, Michael?

Yes, Miss Sue.

Try it again.

He goes back to the book.

SEAN AND LEIGH ANNE

Sean shakes his head.

146 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - FOYER - DAY 146

The doorbell RINGS and Leigh Anne fixes her hair before she

opens it to --

NICK SABAN, a handsome man wearing a sport jacket and LSU rep

tie. Leigh Anne is immediately taken with him.

And you must be Leigh Anne.

Yes, Coach Saban, that's me. Leigh

Anne. Touhy.

Please, call me Nick. What an

incredible home. Love the Windsor

valances.

Thank you. You obviously have good

taste.

Let's just say I appreciate

quality.

Michael and SJ walk in.

NICK SABAN (CONT'D)

And I know it when I see it.

(offers a hand)

Michael, I'm Nick Saban. And you

must be SJ. I hear you have quite

a jump shot, young man.

Nick, why don't you and Michael go

into the living room to talk.

Can SJ come?

Absolutely. I'll recruit the both

of you.

As they walk away, Collins approaches...

I find him extremely handsome.

147 INT. TUOHY HOUSE- LIVING ROOM - DAY (LATER) 147

Michael and SJ sit across from Saban.

So, as soon as possible we'd like

to get you down to Baton Rouge.

We've got a great thing going,

Michael and we plan on winning a

bunch more National Championships.

Whattaya' say, will you commit to a

visit?

Michael turns to SJ, who raises his hand.

Can I ask a question?

Sure.

My brother and me are very close.

I'm worried that if he goes off to

school I won't see him so...

Go on.

I guess I was just wondering how

much access I'd have to him.

Saban smiles at the kid's moxie.

Tell you what, SJ. Michael comes

to LSU I'll get you an all-access

pass. How's that sound?

Sounds good.

161 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 161

Michael studies with Miss Sue, in her Ole Miss sweatshirt.

Have you decided yet, Michael?

No, Miss Sue.

But you like Tennessee?

(off his nod)

It's a good school. Not at the

academic level of Ole Miss but they

do have an outstanding science

department. You know one of the

things they're famous for?

(he shakes his head)

They work with the FBI to study the

effects of the soil on decomposing

body parts.

Michael is a bit lost.

MISS SUE (CONT'D)

When they find a body the police

want to know how long they've been

dead. The fine department at

Tennessee helps them. They have

lots of body parts - arms, legs,

hands - from hospitals and medical

schools. Do you know where they

store them?

(Michael shakes his head)

Right underneath the football

field.

Michael's eyes widen a bit.

MISS SUE (CONT'D)

So, while it's fine and dandy to

have 100,000 fans cheering for you,

the bodies you should be worried

about are right underneath the

turf. Set to poke up through the

ground and grab you.

She raises a clawed hand (think "CARRIE") to make her point.

Michael is completely freaked out by this.

MISS SUE (CONT'D)

But it's your decision where you

play football. Don't let me

influence you.

162 INT. TUGHY HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 162

Ole Miss Coach, ED ORGERON, talks with Leigh Anne.

Congrats on gettin' hired, Coach.

Thank yew, Ma'am. Ole Miss is my

dream job.

Coach 0, you're coming a little

late to the party but we're diehard

Rebels so I'm gonna give you a

frickin' road map, okay?

Yes 'm.

LSU is out. Everybody knows

Saban's going to the NFL. So when

he comes for his visit to Ole Miss,

don't take him to some titty bar

and give him tequila shots. He'll

have nightmares for weeks. Feed

him Italian - he likes Fettucine

Alfredo - take him to a movie - but

not Chainsaw massacre because he'll

just cover his eyes - and put him

to bed by ten. You got it?

Yes'm. What about Tennessee?

It breaks my heart but they're

still in the hunt. Fulmer offered

SJ a sweet deal.

I hear the kid can really pepper

the gumbo.

He's his daddy's boy.

163 INT.. TUOHY HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY (LATER) 163

Orgeron sits with Michael and SJ.

You a Ole Miss tackle, son. I'm

buildin' my line, buildin' my team

aroun' you. Make your parents

proud, come to Oxford, get that

sheepskin and help us win the SEC.

Michael nods, turns to SJ. Before SJ can raise his hand --

ED ORGERON (CONT'D)

And for you, Si, here's what I can

do. At Ole Miss we have The Grove

by the stadium. And the team walks

it before the game, surrounded by

thousands of fans. It's a sacred

ritual. And I'm in front.

("that's it?")

Seen it a thousand times.

Ever seen it from the front of the

line? Next year, you and me --

leading the team.

Tennessee offered to let me run on

the field and flip the coin.

I'll throw in a sideline pass.

Si considers this, smiles and nods.

Leigh Anne and Bob have a chat in the empty classroom.

I will not give a student a grade

he, or she, doesn't deserve.

He needs a B. What's he gonna have

to do to "deserve" that?

Right now Michael's doing C minus,

D plus work. His best chance at

improving is with the written essay

at the end of the year. It counts

for a third of his grade.

That's it. We're sunk.

167 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT 167

Miss Sue works with Michael at the table.

Why not write about "Great

Expectations"? You're a lot like

Pip. He was poor, an orphan and

someone sort of found him. You

should be able to relate to that.

Michael shrugs. Sean is nearby, watching NBA basketball.

MISS SUE (CONT'D)

Fine, let's go through the reading

list. But you have to pick one,

Michael.

(reading from list)

"Pygmalion"... "A Tale of Two

Cities"... "The Charge of the

Light Brigade"...

(almost to himself)

"Half a league, half a league, half

a league onward." I love that one.

Fine, you do this and I'll watch

basketball.

Miss Sue walks over, takes the remote from Sean, who rises.

"All in the valley of Death rode

the six hundred". They call LSU's

stadium Death Valley because of

this story. Alfred, Lord Tennyson

is writing about Ole Miss-LSU.

You're kidding?

No. It's a great story.

It's a poem.

"Forward the Light Brigade!"

That's like the offense. "Charge

for the guns'he said." That's the

end zone. "Into the Valley of

Death rode the six hundred."

He knows it by heart and even miss Sue is impressed.

"Forward the Light Brigade! Was

there a man dAsmay'd? Not tho' the

soldier knew someone had

blundered."

Someone made a mistake?

Yeah, their leader, their coach.

Why would they go ahead if they

knew he messed up?

"Theirs not to make reply, theirs

not to reason why, theirs but to do

and die: Into the Valley of Death

rode the six hundred."

It hits Michael. He takes a moment, looks right at Sean.

They all gonna die, aren't they?

Yeah.

That's really, really sad.

I think you just found something to

write about.

Michael opens his notebook, picks up a pen.

MICHAEL (V.0.)

Courage is a hard thing to figure.

You can have courage based on a

dumb idea or a mistake, but you're

not supposed to question adults, or

your coach, or your teacher because

they make the rules. Maybe they

know best but maybe they don't.

SERIES OF REPEATED SHOTS:

168 EXT. HURT VILLAGE - REPEATED SHOT - DAY 168

Michael moves through the tough crowd.

MICHAEL (V.0.)

It all depends on who you are,

where you come from. Didn't at

least one of the six hundred guys

think about giving up and joining

with the other side? I mean,

Valley of Death, that's pretty

salty stuff.

169 EXT. WINGATE - REPEATED SHOT - DAY 169

Michael walks under the arch for the first time.

MICHAEL (V.0.)

That's why courage is tricky.

Should you always do what others

tell you to do? Sometimes you

might not even know why you're

doing something. I mean, any fool

can have courage.

170 INT. LAUNDROMAT - REPEATED SHOT - NIGHT 170

Michael leans against the wall and tries to sleep.

MICHAEL (V.0.)

But honor, that's the real reason

you either do something or you

don't. It's who you are and maybe

who you want to be. If you die

trying for something important then

you have both honor and courage and

that's pretty good.

171 INT. WINGATE - BOB'S LITERATURE CLASS - DAY 171

Bob sits at his desk, reading Michael's. essay. As he turns

to the last page...

MICHAEL (V.0.)

I think that's what the writer was

saying. That you should try for

courage and hope for honor. And

maybe even pray that the people

telling you what. to do have some,

too.

Bob, visibly moved, sets down the essay and smiles.

Graduation day and Sean sits beside an empty seat in the

plops down in the seat next to him.

What?

(off Sean's' look)

Michael's final GPA. Got it off

Paul's computer. He did it, Sean.

He did it!

Sean grins, then...

Wait a minute. You broke into the

principal's computer?

173 INT. WINGATE - AUDITORIUM - DAY (LATER) 173

Graduation ceremonies. Paul Sandstrom reads the names and

the graduates move across the stage to get their diplomas.

As each student walks across the stage a BABY PICTURE of their

is PROJECTED.

Michael Jerome Oher.

Even though no one is supposed to clap, a spontaneous round

of APPLAUSE gives Michael pause as he accepts his diploma.

Projected behind him is a picture of the cutest African-

American infant the world has ever seen.

ON SEAN AND LEIGH ANNE

Where'd you find a baby picture of

Michael?

Scanned it off an Internet ad for a

toddler boutique.

(off his look)

Tell a soul and I'll rip your

tongue out.

IN THE CROWD: The Tuohys, Big Tony, Miss Sue, Bob and the

other teachers all clap.

174 EXT. WINGATE - OUTSIDE THE AUDITORIUM -.DAY 174

Michael, diploma in hand, shakes Sean's hand. Sean moves

close, looks him in the eye.

I want you to know something.

You'n me, okay?

I never believed you could do this.

But you did. And I'm as proud of

you as I am ashamed of myself. I

should know better. I'll never

doubt you again, Michael.

Michael smiles, nods, gives Leigh Anne a little hug then raps

knuckles with Si and high fives Collins.

Excuse me young man, but I think I

need a proper hug.

He smiles and moves to her. Off their embrace

175-176 OMITTED 175-176

177-182 OMITTED 177-182

183 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 183

Leigh Anne and Sean go over Ole Miss pamphlets with Michael.

You'll be living in Deaton Hall --

here. You'll have a meal plan and

you'll go to Johnson commons to

eat.

Johnson Commons has all you can eat

self-serve ice cream.

As much as you want?

Yep, that's how Mama put on her

freshman ten.

Leigh Anne rolls up a pamphlet and whacks him hard on her way

to answer a RINGING PHONE.

184 INT. BUttDING HALLWAY - DAY 184

They just want to ask you a few

questions. You've got nothing to

hide, Michael.

They arrive at a door, open it.

185 INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 185

Sits Investigator Granger in the room we've seen before. She

rises, professional, but not smiling.

Mrs. Tuohy? Mr. Oher? My name is

Jocelyn Granger and I'm the

Assistant Director of Enforcement

for the NCAA.

Please call me Leigh Anne.

Leigh Anne shakes her hand and she and Michael move to the

chairs.

Mrs. Tuohy, I'd prefer to speak

with Michael alone.

How long will this take?

Awhile.

Michael starts rubbing his knees, nervous as hell.

Michael, I'll be outside.

Leigh Anne pecks his cheek and exits, giving Michael one last

look before she leaves.

186 EXT. BUILDING - DAY 186

Leigh Anne sits on a bench, talking on the phone.

I've got a bad feeling about this,

Sean. This broad is tough. Oh,.

Susie's on the other line.

Hey... . what does the client

want?... But that's tacky... You

know what, fine, if she wants her

living room to look like a bordello

make it happen.

She hangs up, checks her watch and looks toward the building.

187 INT. NONDESCRIPT GOVERNMENT-LOOKING ROOM - DAY 187

The interrogation is ongoing...

Your parents are friends with Coach

Bert Cotton, correct?

Coach is a good guy.

Were you aware that Coach Cotton is

accepting a job at Ole Miss?

(Michael shakes his head)

And that this job offer came after

you signed with them?

(no response from Michael)

Sean Tuohy, your legal guardian

went to Ole Miss.

He played basketball.

And Mrs. Tuohy attended Ole Miss as

well.

She was a cheerleader.

Is it safe to say that Ole Miss is

their favorite school?

Do they like any other

Universities?

What about, say Tennessee?

They can't stand Tennessee.

So they wouldn't be happy if you

chose to play football there?

No.

And your tutor...

Miss Sue is an Ole Miss grad, too.

Did Miss Sue try to persuade you to

attend Ole Miss?

Did you know that the Tuohys make

generous donations to Ole Miss?

That even Miss Sue makes donations?

That the:Tuohy's have a condo in

Oxford so they can attend as many

athletic events as possible? That,

in fact, Sean and Leigh Anne Tuohy

are by our definition "boosters."

What's that mean?

A booster is someone with an

abnormal interest in a school's

sports. Someone who-contributes

financially to the University's

athletic program.

Michael doesn't answer, just keeps rubbing his knees. Then

comes the part we've heard before...'

Mr. Oher, do you know why I'm here?

Mr. Oher?...

MICHAEL (V.0.)

Do you know, do you understand why

I'm here?

MICHAEL (V.0.)

To... investigate.

Yes. To investigate. I'm here to

investigate your odd...

predicament. Do you find it odd?

Your predicament?

Michael?...

Iono...

she sifts through her briefcase, pulls out files, documents -

a good bit of evidence for whatever trouble Michael is in.

She sits back, stares at Michael, as if trying to figure him

out. Michael can't meet her gaze. He looks out the window,

rubs his knees some more.

Can I... can I leave now?

No. You can't.

Michael's building up anxiety by the second.

What do you want, ma'am?

What I want, what my job is, is to

discern whether something untoward

occurred in your recruitment to Ole

Miss.

Unto...

I want the facts. I need the

truth.

I didn't lie...

And I want to know what you think

about all this.

THINK ABOUT WHAT?!

It's the first time we've ever heard Michael raise his voice.

It echoes in the room. Granger lets it die before she leans

forward and continues...

The NCAA fears that with your

recruitment a door might be opened

that boosters from lots of schools

in the south will become legal

guardians for young athletes

without means and funnel them to

their Alma Maters.

Michael still doesn't get it, shakes his head.

I'm not saying I believe it and I'm

not saying I don't, but there are

many people involved with this case

who would argue that the Tuohys

took you in, fed you, clothed you,

paid for your private education --

(almost to himself)

No...no...no...

-- bought you a car and paid for a

tutor all as part of a plan to

insure that you played football for

the University of Mississippi.

Now Michael understands. He stares at the floor for a long

time then quickly stands and makes for the door.

Michael, we're not finished.

But he's gone.

188 EXT. GOVERNMENT BUILDING - DAY 188

Leigh Anne sees Michael exit the building. Once he's outside

he moves in circles, gesticulating and talking to himself.

Leigh Anne races over --

Michael, what's wrong?

He looks at her, glares really; upset.

Why'd you do it?

All along you wanted me to go to

Ole Miss.

Well, of course, but...

Why did you do this for me?!

What?

Everything! Was it for you or was

it for me? Was it so I would go to

school where you wanted?! Was it

so I would do what you wanted?!

No, Michael...

(points to building)

That's what she thinks! Is she

right?!

(her own words)

Don't you dare lie to me!

Leigh Anne digests this, takes a breath...

Michael, look... I can see where,

where some people might...

Her inability, for the first time, to articulate, hits

Michael in the face.

I'm not stupid!

He turns and walks away.

Michael?!

But she doesn't move, just watches him go.

190 INT. TUGHY HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT 190

Sean and Leigh Anne sit at the kitchen table while Collins

and SJ pace in the living room.

(on her cell)

Well if he comes by there let me

know. Thanks.

Michael, please call me and let me

know you're okay.

Text him SJ.

Keep it light. Tell him you're

gonna take his truck for a spin if

he doesn't get in touch.

SJ starts texting. Leigh Anne and Sean stare at each other.

A191 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - SEAN AND'LEIGH ANNE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT A191

Sean sits in bed and Leigh Anne paces.

I should have followed him.

You had no way of knowing he'd

disappear.

Was he right?

(off Sean's look)

What he said about us?

Leigh Anne, be sensible. We gave

clothes to a boy who had one pair

of shorts. We gave him a bed. To

hell with the NCAA, I'd do it again

tomorrow.

A191 CONTINUED: A191

What about the rest of it - all the

stuff we did to make sure he got a

scholarship? A scholarship to Ole

Miss.

He could go wherever he wanted, he

knew that.

Did he? Did you ask him? 'Cause I

know for sure I never did.

Sean considers this, then beckons.

Come here, honey.

She moves to him. He puts his arm around her, kisses her

forehead.

Am I a good person?

(off his look)

Not a joke. Not rhetorical.

You're the best person I know.

Everything you do, you do for

others.

Why is that?

(with a smile)

I have not a clue. You obviously

get some sick satisfaction from it.

She looks at him. There's truth in his words.

Sean... what if he never comes

back?

191 EXT. HURT VILLAGE - NIGHT 191

Michael makes his way toward Building "C", passing some of

the same faces we've seen before.

Alton opens his door to make a transaction with an addict'and

spots Michael.

That you Big Mike? Get your ass in

here.

I'm looking for Moms.

Your Mama? Oh, I seen Dee Dee

around. She usually stop by for a

taste around this time. Tell you

what, I'll get you a forty and

we'll chop it up 'til she get here.

Michael hesitates. Alton smiles, beckons.

193 INT. HURT VILLAGE - ALTON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 193

Shitty but with good electronics. There are maybe eight

people in the apartment - partying, drinking, getting high.

Michael steps inside. Alton points to a chair. A stoned out

couple smokes on the adjacent couch.

Next to them an INFANT cries in a broken down crib. In the

other corner of the room sits David, the young man we met

before. Michael nods and David nods back. Alton hands

Michael a beer.

It's good to see you, Big Mike.

You lookin' fit. I heard you

playin' some ball.

Yeah.

But you know that rich kid football

ain't like the public school

league. People packing knives in

their socks. Back in the day I was

a quarterback. You knew that,

right? At MLK.

Yeah, I heard.

You still playing ball over at the

JC?

Naw.

He with me now! I'll open a spot

for you, too.

Got tired of going to class. Always

somebody tellin' me what to do.

Turn it up, bitch!

David jumps up and cranks the volume on a RAP SONG until the

beat is bouncing off the walls. Michael sips the beer; rubs

his knees.

You stayin' to the other side of

town, that's what Dee Dee said.

Said you got a new Mama. She fine,

too. I seen her when she come to

see Dee Dee.

She came here?

She got any other kids? She got a

daughter?

You tap that?

Michael sets down the beer, rises to leave.

Where you going? Sit down. I

wanna hear about your fine white

sister. 'Cause I like me some

mommy/daughter.

Shut up.

Alton steps in front of Michael, raises his hands ---

Shutup?You tellin' me to shut

up?I'llcap your fat ass. Cap

yourass,drive east and pay a

visittoyour Cracker Mama and her

Michael shoves him hard. Alton unprepared for the force,

flies back against the wall. On the ground he reaches in his

belt for his gun, but just as he gets it out --

Michael slaps it away. He picks up Alton and throws him

across the room. The party comes unhinged as Michael grabs

Alton, holds him against the wall with one hand while

pounding him with the other. Blood flies from Alton's face -

eighteen years of subdued rage coming out in seconds.

TWO OTHER GUYS grab Michael from behind and one --

STICKS A GUN IN MICHAEL'S TEMPLE

Michael screams like a banshee, spins, grabs them and tackles

them over the couch. An errant round FIRES into the ceiling.

A table flies and the crib smashes.

Michael looks to David, frozen in the corner, then over to

the SCREAMING child on the floor.

He grabs his head and heaves, trying to make it all stop -

the music, the screams, the crying. The shots PULSE to the

music and. are INTERCUT WITH:

194 EXT. HURT VILLAGE - DAY 194

PULSING FLASHBACK IMAGES

MICHAEL, AGE SEVEN, and several half brothers and sisters in

front of Hurt Village as Child Protective Services herds them

away from Denise Oher. She's screaming, the kids are crying.

Michael breaks away and runs to Denise.

SEVEN YEAR OLD MICHAEL

MAMA!! 1 1

He grabs her waist and is pulled away by an officer.

FLASHBACK ENDS. BACK TO SCENE AT...

195 INT. ALTON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 195

196 INT. TUOHY HOUSE - HALLWAY/MICHAEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 196

197 INT. LEIGH ANNE'S CAR - DAY 197

198 EXT. WEST SIDE OF MEMPHIS STREET - DAY 198

199 EXT. HURT VILLAGE - DAY 199

Leigh Anne approaches the complex. Alton, his face bandaged,

sits on the stoop with his crowd. A mother holds the

unharmed baby.

He gone.

Leigh Anne stops, looks to Alton.

But you tell him I'll be seeing him

around. You tell him he'll get his.

Michael was here?

Last night. Sneaked me then took

off like a little bitch. So you

tell him, sleep with one eye open.

Yod'hear me, bitch?'

Leigh Anne steps closer to Alton, stares him down.

No, you hear me, bitch. You

threaten my son you threaten me.

You so much as cross downtown

you'll be sorry. I'm in a prayer

group with the D.A., I'm a member

of the NRA and I am always packing.

She taps her tiny purse. Alton laughs.

What you got in there, a .22? You

got yourself a Saturday Night

Special?

And it shoots just fine all the

other days, too.

She turns on her heels and strides to her car.

200 INT. LEIGH ANNE'S CAR - DAY 200

When she gets in she's so nervous she hyperventilates. Her

phone RINGS and she opens the tiny purse revealing nothing

more than a wallet and the phone. She recognizes the number

and answers...

Michael?!!!

201 EXT. LAUNDROMAT - DAY 201

Leigh Anne pulls up, stops and they lock eyes.

MICHAEL (V.0.)

You think the police gonna come and

get me?

202 EXT. CURB - DAY 202

Leigh Anne sits on the curb with Michael.

I'd imagine the last thing anybody

at Hurt Village wants is cops

snooping around.

(after a beat)

I swore I'd never ask but... how'd

you make it out of there, Michael?

When I was little and something

awful was happening, my Mama would

tell me to close my eyes.

She was tryin' to keep me from

seeing her do drugs or other bad

things. And she'd say, "keep 'em

closed till I say so." And then

when she was finished or the bad

things were over she'd say, "now

when I count to three, you open

your eyes and the past is gone, the

world is a good place, and it's all

gonna be okay."

You closed your eyes.

He nods. She shakes her head, amazed at the kid. They stare

out at the street, then...

LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D)

You know, when I was driving all

over Kingdom Come looking for you I

just kept thinking about one thing.

Ferdinand the bull. Everyone

assumed because he was big that he

wanted to fight in the ring. But

he just wanted to sit under a tree

and smell the flowers.

(right at him)

I know I should have asked this a

long time ago but do you even wanna

play football? I mean, do you even

like it?'

Michael considers this.

I'm pretty good at it.

Yeah, you are.

Sean and I have been talking and

Michael, if you're gonna accept a

football scholarship we think it

should be from Tennessee.

(off his look)

And I promise you I will be at

every game cheering for you.

Every game?

But I will not wear that gaudy

orange of theirs because it's not

in my color wheel.

You want me to go to Tennessee?

I want you to go wherever you want.

It's your decision, Michael. It's

your life.

What if I wanted to flip burgers?

She takes this in, swallows hard and

Your decision; your life.

Michael smiles.

Okay.

Okay, what?

203 INT. NONDESCRIPT GOVERNMENT-LOOKING ROOM - DAY 203

I'm sorry I left the other day.

You were pretty upset.

You ask a lot of questions.

I'm trying to get to the bottom of

this.

But all the questions you asked

were about why everybody else

wanted me to go to Ole Miss.

Okay...

You asked about everybody but me.

You never asked why I wanted to go

there.

Alright, fine, Michael... why do

you want to go to Ole Miss?

It's where my family goes to

school. It's where they've always

gone to school.

Granger considers this, stares at Michael, then almost, just

almost, smiles.

204 EXT. OLE MISS DORM - DAY 204

Cars are unloaded as parents and siblings move their kids

into the dorm. Tearful good-byes and lots of picture taking.

Leigh Anne and.Sean walk from the dorm toward the car, giving

last words of advice. SJ and.Collins are there, too.

College is going to be a different

experience for you. There are lots

of distractions.

Just have fun.

There'll always be some nimrod in

the dorm who wants to play video

games all night, or goof off on the

internet.

You're gonna have a great time. I

know I did.

Leigh Anne gives Sean a look - "You're not helping."

You'll spend lots of time at

practice which means you have to be

very dedicated to your studies.

MISS SUE (O.S.)

Relax, Mama.

Miss Sue walks up carrying papers.

MISS SUE (CONT'D)

Just got back from the library

where I reserved a private cubicle

for the semester.

(hands sheets to Michael)

Here's your class schedule and our

study hall hours.

She reaches in her purse for her keys.

MISS SUE (CONT'D)

Now, if y'all don't mind I'm gonna

go move into my new apartment.

She walks away.

Thank you, Miss Sue.

Yeah, yeah, yeah...

Sean and Michael and SJ eye a GROUP OF ATTRACTIVE COEDS

sashaying past. SJ does a little dance move and laughs.

Have a lot of fun.

Leigh Anne notices their looks.

Michael Oher, you listen to me. I

want you to enjoy yourself but you

need to know that if you get a girl

pregnant out of wedlock I will

climb in the car, drive here to

Oxford and cut off your penis.

(sotto: to Michael)

She means it.

Yes ma'am.

Leigh Anne gives Sean a look that says, "let's get on the

road." Sean offers a hand; Michael shakes it. Collins high

fives him. SJ offers a fist; Michael knocks it.

Leigh Anne, tearing up, nods and gives Michael a quick hug.

Thank you, Mama.

Overwhelmed, she turns for the car with a little wave.

The 78'll be a parking lot. We

should go.

She gets inside and closes the door for privacy.

Sean, SJ, Collins and Michael stand there, watching her cry.

Why does she always do that?

She's an onion, Michael. You have

to peel her one layer at a time.

Michael walks over to the car, knocks on the window. She

rolls it down, dabbing tears from her eyes.

What?

I need a proper hug.

She gets out of the car and holds him for a long time.

SERIES OF STILL PHOTOS:

"LOCAL YOUTH SHOT AND KILLED"

LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE

I read a story the other day about

a boy from the projects. No

daddy, in and out of foster care.

LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE (CONT'D)

He'd been killed in a gang fight at

Hurt Village.

A newspaper photo of a dead boy from the.projects. Then

another headline, another young, black face. Another and

another, until the last headline shows a photo of David,

Alton's minion - his face full of shining promise.

LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE

In the last paragraph they talked

about his superb athletic skills

and how different his life might

have been if he hadn't fallen

behind and dropped out of school.

He was twenty-one years old the day

he died. It was his birthday.

207 STILL PHOTO OF HURT VILLAGE

Lonely, falling apart.

LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE

That could have been anyone. It

could have been my son, Michael.

208 STILL PHOTO OF OLE MISS CAMPUS

Beautiful on a fall day. And then THE STILL COMES TO LIFE

and Michael, books in hand, ENTERS FRAME walking. It's like

the other Michael/crowd shots with one difference - this time

he moves at the same speed as everyone else.

LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE

But it wasn't. And I suppose I

have God to thank for that. God

and Lawrence Taylor.

A209 INT. SEAN'S CAR - DAY

As the family drives home from Ole Miss, we notice that Leigh

Anne is very still. And very content. She closes her eyes.

FADE TO BLACK.

LEIGH ANNE'S VOICE

One Mississippi...

Michael Oher was a freshman All-American in his first season

and, with help from Miss Sue, made the Dean's List.

Collins followed in her Mom's footsteps and became a

cheerleader at Ole Miss.

Sean and Leigh Anne still live in Memphis.

FADE UP ON:

210 EXT. THE GROVE -- DAY
