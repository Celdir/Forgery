INT. DINING ROOM - TOM GRUNEMANN HOUSE - DAY

CLOSE SHOT of TOM GRUNEMANN, attractive young

executive, sitting at the head of the dining room

table carving a turkey for Thanksgiving Day dinner.

There are joyous sounds of celebration. The CAMERA

PANS around the table revealing the happy family

and guests. Among them are KLUTE and CABLE.

Camera stops at Mrs. Grunemann who sits at the foot

of the table opposite her husband. She smiles

across at him with pleasure. We cut to Tom

Grunemann smiling back at her. We cut back to a

closeup of Mrs. Grunemann  looking back at her

husband with love. We cut back to Tom Grunemann's

chair - only now it is empty. The joyous sounds

disappear on this cut. It appears that Tom

Grunemann has disappeared before our eyes. One

moment he is there, and the next moment he is gone.

The camera pans back down the table, only now it is

empty except for Grunemann's children and Mrs.

Grunemann. She is now dressed in something dark.

She and the three children sit eating another meal

in emptiness. She has changed from a joyous woman

to a woman bereaved.

INT. RESEARCH PLANT: ON ROSS - DAY

The industrial frontier. SPECIAL AGENT ROSS steps

into frame, glancing (perhaps idly, a little

impatiently) in this direction at some loud

industrial goings-on just beyond camera, then

returns toward GROUP.

The group includes CABLE and a YOUNGER FBI AGENT

with clipboard, to whom KLUTE is supplying

preliminary data. KLUTE's manner is somewhat

rumpled, awkward.

C.U. KLUTE

Klute reads. We see a controlled incredulity and

revulsion.

INT. GRUNEMANN HOUSE: C.U. HOLLY - DAY

HOLLY thrusts the letter back toward camera, toward

KLUTE crying out -

Klute nods. She is talking for both of them. Klute

looks out the window to the children playing

outside. CAMERA PANS out window to Klute's POV of

children playing on a cold winter day. The trees

are stripped bare.

EXT. RESEARCH PLANT

Tree lined area, lush and green - Summer.

INT. RESEARCH PLANT: DIRECTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

CAMERA pulls back inside window to Klute staring

outside, as if still pondering the fate of Tom

Grunemann. The group in the office includes ROSS

(holding a report), TRASK, a New York detective,

Cable, and the plant director, STREIGER.

He shakes his head, gestures doubtingly. Ross caps

it.

Pause. Ross and Trask look at Klute - more than a

bit startled - then at each other. Klute just looks

uneasy.

INT/EXT. WIDE SHOT: PENNSYLVANIA COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

Verdant Pennsylvania farmland. Early morning. Near

at hand an open field set about with bee hutches

and patched with mist.

A FIGURE, a shadow (Klute's actually) moves across

frame from the left, blanking in. We reorient to -

INT. BEDROOM - KLUTES HOUSE - DAY

We see that we've been looking out from the bedroom

window of this house. Klute turns to rolltop desk

in bedroom and picture of Tom Grunemann, picture of

Bree Daniel, and other material he has collected on

the case. He puts them in his suitcase and closes

the suitcase. He shuts rolltop desk.

INT. KLUTE'S HOUSE - DAY

We follow Klute through the house with suitcase. He

puts away a last dish, shutting off water, gas, and

electricity, and so on -- takes a last look around

- reaches for the door handle. WE CUT TO --

INT. COMMERCIAL AUDITION - SOUND STAGE - DAY

A section of wall, a door coming open -- and the

FIGURE of BREE entering and standing. We have gone

from the warm sunlight of the country to mustv

darkness.

She appears chic, poised, and perfect as a magazine

picture.

But as she gets used to the darkness and her eyes

focus on a line of equally beautiful girls sitting

and waiting in folding chairs along a wall, we see

that she is a great deal less certain of demeanor.

Assailable. WE CUT TO -

EXT. KLUTE'S HOUSEYARD, HOUSE, BARN - DAY

Klute, stepping out, closes, locks and checks the

house door, then moves on to his car -- a vintage

Plymouth -- and tosses in his suitcase; and then

takes a last turn around the yard itself; props

open the cover of a beehutch, and lets down the

rail gate of a sidefield. He approaches to roll

shut his barn door -- and on this action we CUT

again TO --

INT. COMMERCIAL AUDITION - SOUNDSTAGE - DAY

She slaps the cup down, hurls herself forward --

SWISH PAN -- onto a MALE ACTOR, thrusting him down

to the floor, her hands at his throat. As we WIDEN

TO INCLUDE DIRECTOR AND MORE OF SCENE, and as the

Director reads from script, supplying a narrator

voice -

Bree and the Male Actor relax slightly, as -

ANGLE TO REVEAL ROOM, OTHERS

We reestablish the scene -- a few pieces of film

equipment -- and the congery of other ACTORS and

ACTRESSES preparing to read for parts. As the

Director approaches, counsels Bree -- all of this

quick and consecutive --

-- but then he glances at his watch, and at the

others waiting their turn.

Bree and the Male Actor set their cheeks together,

beaming half-moon smiles to camera, hold it for a

moment, as the Director reads again -

-- and holds out his hands for their scripts, at

the same time as he summons from a list in his

other hand --

BREE passes a new group of beautiful girls sitting

in line waiting their turn as she exits as brightly

as possible.

EXT. NEW YORK SIDEWALK: PEDESTRIANS - DAY

They trudge along the sidewalk -- the herd, the

late-afternoon crush. A LONG-LENS shot, the crowd

compacted. We see BREE milling along with the rest.

She maneuvers to a sidewalk PHONE BOOTH, enters. We

see her deposit, dial.

INT. PHONE BOOTH, BREE - DAY

She is connected (to her registry).

She waits for a moment. Then makes a curious, small

gesture of her hand -- deposits another dime, dials

again, is answered.

As she prepares to write it down, we CUT BACK TO -

EXT. KLUTE'S HOUSEYARD: KLUTE - DAY

Klute finishes rolling shut, and padlocks, the barn

door. He returns to his car, sits in (leaving door

open) starts engine. Again -- one last time -- the

look around. Then he pulls the door shut, pulls

out. And on this we CUT TO --

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY

A GROUP -- middle-aged Couple, Child, Bellman with

suitcases -- wait to descend in elevator as BREE

gets off. We TRACK with her along corridor to a

door. She checks number and knocks.

REVERSE: THROUGH DOOR TO BREE

A MAN opens the door. We neither see or hear him

clearly -- he is foreground, defocused. His shirt

is untucked. Bree cocks her head, greets him

cutely.

He mumbles some kind of greeting, steps back. She

pauses a moment in the door (casing, instantly) --

then quite confident, friendly, provocative all at

once --

-- and CUT TO --

EXT. CENTER OF TOWN: KLUTE DRIVING - DAY

Klute's car draws through the business section of

town, moves on --

INT. HOTEL ROOM: BREE - DAY

C.U. BREE (the Man out of frame and unheard-from)

as she bargains gaily -- and at the same time a

little watchfully.

-- and CUT TO --

INT. CAR: KLUTE DRIVING - DAY

Klute has laid his jacket aside, rolled his

sleeves, is eating the last of a vending machine

sandwich. The CAR RADIO is on. He leans forward,

tuning it from --

-- to --

-- and CUT TO --

INT. C.U. ON BREE, MAN (HOTEL BED) - DAY

The Man's face is buried against her neck, her

labors over her. She cries out ecstatically,

transportedly -- it would seem at the edge of

orgasm --

-- and at the same time refers privately to her

wristwatch. And CUT TO --

EXT. WIDE SHOT: ACCESS RAMP OF TURNPIKE - LUSH

HILLY COUNTRY - DAY

KLUTE'S CAR

As Klute's car drives onto the turnpike surrounded

by green country, we ZOOM into a close shot of

Klute through the windshield of his car. And then

in what seems like a continuous shot we ZOOM back

to a wide angle revealing Klute caught in the

endless line of cars in a typical traffic jam at

the entrance to New York City, surrounded by

smoggy, grey, urban skies.

INT. CITY MULTILAYERED PARKING BUILDING - KLUTE'S

CAR - NIGHT

KLUTE sits inside his car as it is mechanically

lifted into the air. It looks as if he is being

manipulated by a robot.

EXT. STREET: OUTSIDE THE BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

BREE moves along street, returning home,

apprehensive of the one or two other distant

FIGURES. She turns in at one of the Brownstones.

INT. STAIRWELL OF BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

We watch Bree as she mounts to the top floor, the

door of her apartment, barren, isolated,

frightened.

INT. BREE'S APTARTMENT - NIGHT

BREE unlocks the door, switches on a light, cases

the apartment for a moment before entering,

securing chain-lock, putting aside her things.

There is a RECORD PLAYER near the first interior

doorway. She switches it as she moves by. By time

the first record has dropped, she has the shower

turned on, is getting rid of her dress. We CUT BACK

TO --

EXT. EMPTY STREET: KLUTE - NIGHT

Klute walks, as before, carrying his suitcase. We

see him slow, concernedly looking toward --

INT. BREE'S APARTMENT: ON BREE - NIGHT

Bree sits on a studio couch, near the record

player, with a QUILT huddled over and around her,

her back against the wall. The MUSIC is classical,

curiously -- the sound of a HARPSICHORD. She is

more or less expressionless -- but trembling

violently, shaking.

FRONT WINDOW SIGN BEING REMOVED WHICH READS "FOR

RENT" - STORE - INQUIRE CRAWICZ, DAY

INT. BREE's APARTMENT: BREE - DAY

Bree moves about energetically, preparing to set

out on rounds. A KNOCK on the door. She startled,

then approaches to door, to peep-hole, lifts lid

aside.

THROUGH PEEPHOLE TO KLUTE FACE

Klute's face is somewhat distorted by the peephole

lens; he is gazing mildly about the landing.

BREE

She turns the door handle , parts the door about

three inches, looks through at him. He starts to

enter.

-- and the door crunches against its chain-lock. He

stops perforce, a bit startled. A pause. A slice of

Bree's face looks coldly out at him. He summons a

smile.

She tightens again.

He takes out a folded letter and a wallet and

passes them both through to her. Silence. She

examines them with care, then appears to soften a

little; even smiles slightly.

She smiles again, hands the letter and wallet back

out, closes the door (doesn't slam, just closes).

Klute looks at it blankly for a time, starts to

knock again, decides not to -- turns and descends

the stairs.

BREE

Bree listens through the door to his departing foot

steps. They fade from hearing. She hastens to

assemble her properties.

EXT. FRONT DOOR - DAY

Klute comes out door and descends the stairs at the

same even pace -- he walks into the vacant store

below.

INT. BASEMENT STORE - DAY

It had once been a Boutique that sold happy

clothes. There are some psychedelic posters and a

few remnants of its former identity. Klute's

suitcase is propped open on a cot behind a counter.

The ceilings are low, forcing Klute to stoop as he

enters. He seems out of place and out of scale. A

case containing a tape recorder stands on the

floor. On the table are a FOLDER of Klute's notes,

and a paper bag. Klute enters and deliberately

resumes his settling in. From the paper bag he sets

aside an electric FAN, then lifts out from the

shopping bag a cheap tin ALARM CLOCK and begins

winding it.

INT. BREE'S APARTMENT - DAY

Bree has shifted position to a window, is looking

down at the street. She sees - and we hear - SOUND

OF BUS APPROACHING, distantly. She grabs her

properties, whips out the door.

EXT. ON DOOR OF BROWNSTONE - DAY

Bree skids to a stop just inside the door, scans

quickly out in one direction then the other (in

case Klute has been waiting in ambush on the

sidewalk) then races -- PAN -- to BUS AT CURB --

makes it, pulls herself aboard --

INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: KLUTE - DAY

Klute has been watching from his window. We hear

the BUS PULLING AWAY. He turns back, plugs in the

electric fan. Then hoists the TAPE RECORDER,

unsnaps the cover. We see clearly what it is.

INT. AGENCY OFFICE - DAY

BREE is showing her notebook to an AGENT. He leans

forward courteously, occasionally stroking his

forehead with his fingertips -- a nice man with a

headache.

She starts for the door -- he's already turning

away -- then ducks back, hands him one of her

Glossies, laughing prettily at her own

forgetfulness.

EXT. STREET - DAY

BREE comes out, pauses with notebook to cross out,

the call completed, checks the list of those

remaining, sets forth again. We hear TRASK'S VOICE

OVER, very quick, very clipped.

INT. MISSING PERSONS BUREAU - DAY

CLOSEUP photograph of dead man. It is replaced with

series of photgraphs of dead men. CAMERA pulls back

to reveal KLUTE flipping through the file of the

unidentified dead.

KLUTE closes the file.

As KLUTE slowly walks away we bring in TELEPHONE

RING and BREE VOICE, OVER answering.

EXT. BREE APARTMENT - NIGHT

Camera is looking up through lighted window outside

at BREE on phone.

EXT. KLUTE APARTMENT - NIGHT

CAMERA pans down from BREE's window to KLUTE's

window at the bottom revealing KLUTE at tape

recorder. The TAPE RECORDER is going, its light

winking. KLUTE holds headset against one ear, makes

a note or two. We hear BREE's and other GIRL'S

VOICES, UNDER, FILTERED.

Klute sets down the headset (we drop the VOICES far

under, INDISTINGUISHABLE), makes a note, and thumbs

open the box of a fresh reel; the present reel is

near the end. We establish a pile of ALREADY

RECORDED TAPES. We CUT BACK TO --

INT. BREE APARTMENT: BREE ON PHONE - NIGHT

She hangs up, starts away. The PHONE RINGS AGAIN.

She tries to ignore it. It persists. She finally

turns back to answer it, and we CUT TO --

INT. CASTING OFFICE - AD AGENCY - DAY

CAMERA STARTS on huge photo montage of the Family

of Man and pans down to a group of beautiful girls

sitting on a bench below. They are dwarfed by the

enormous picture. Each one clutches an almost

identical portfolio of pictures in her lap. Camera

pans down row of portfolios until it stops at BREE

- impatiently waiting her turn. WE CONTINUE THE

TELEPHONE VOICES OVER, WILD TRACK STYLE. The MAN'S

VOICE is thick with drink, and emotion. First the

click, then --

A CLICK, and the MAN'S VOICE CONTINUING, trailing

into helpless sobs --

EXT. STREET: BREE

Bree comes out from the building (note possible

costume change; not necessarily consecutive

action), checks off on her list continues on her

way -- as we CONTINUE WILD TRACK STYLE VOICES.

Starting with a CLICK and --

We FADE THIS CONVERSATION UNDER BUT HOLD,

CONTINUING, as --

BREE PASSES CAMERA -- and we PAN TO SHOT OF KLUTE,

at corner, unseen by her and apparently in

surveillance of her. Then he too turns out of

frame, and we CUT TO --

INT. PENN STATION - DAY

CAMERA is looking down at an enormous gift package

on a platform. There is a sound of a recorded

fanfare and with the pull of a string the package

is opened revealing a brand new LINCOLN CONTINENTAL

CONVERTIBLE. People applaud and the car starts to

revolve. At the wheel of the car sits BREE. We CUT

to a shot through the windshield of car --

BREE'S POV

A sea of staring faces revolves around her. We

cross fade with SPANGLER VOICE OVER (as if

recalling a case record).

EXT. WOMEN'S PRISON ROOF - CAGED IN RECREATION AREA

SPANGLER, a prison psychiatrist, sits on a bench

eating a sandwich partially wrapped in wax paper

and sipping from a carton of milk. He is obviously

a man pressed for time. KLUTE sits beside him.

Across from them some prisoners are taking their

exercise. Through the metallic netting that

surrounds them, we see the skyline of New York

City. It only dramatizes more the sense of being

caged.

INT. PENN STATION - DAY

POV world revolving around BREE through windshield

of car. The circular motion slows down and then

stops. Cut to BREE getting out of car and walking

off platform. She looks a bit shaky. She is stopped

by one of the spectators.

She looks at him in disgust and crosses to phone

booth.

INT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY

INT. CHURCH DISCOTHEQUE - NIGHT

We are in the interior of what was once a church

and is now a discotheque. Interior is painted

purple; the record player stands on the altar over

the crowd. Pews are massed around the dance floor.

Stained glass windows are lighted from behind and

are circled with light bulbs that flash on and off.

For all of its obviously bizarre visual quality,

there is a sense of relaxation. It is a late night

gathering place of many who belong to the sexual

underworld of the city.

BREE and the OTHER GIRL advance to a pew. A MAN

sitting there (the other girl's pimp) with a THIRD

GIRL. BREE's companion greet him shyly, tenderly:

she and BREE sit down, join in conversation.

PULL BACK SLOWLY -- other pews, other girls and a

few men, the sisterhood -- To --

BAR AREA IN BACK (WHAT ONCE MUST HAVE BEEN THE

VESTIBULE OF THE CRURCH)

Among the people around the bar, pimps, whores, and

a sprinkling of hopeful Johns and curiosity

seekers. The camera picks a familiar face: CABLE.

He watches BREE with a mixture of amusement and

contempt. A GIRL comes over to him and tries to

proposition him. They appear to be discussing

price. Just as she thinks it is set, he walks away.

INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

CLOSEUP photograph of TOM GRUNEMANN pinned to a

large piece of beaverboard KLUTE has placed on a

wall. CAMERA PANS over various pictures and pieces

of evidence KLUTE has pinned up in an attempt to

make some sense from the puzzle of TOM GRUNMIANN's

disappearance. CAMERA PANS over to KLUTE sitting on

cot looking up at the pieces of the puzzle. There

is a heated TV dinner in front of him.

The TAPE RECORDER reels start turning (sound

powered), the recording light starts winding (as

BREE, above, dials). KLUTE pays it scant attention

- he can catch up with the news anytime. He sits

manfully in front of the TV dinner, starts peeling

back the foil --

INT. BREE'S APARTMENT: BREE - NIGHT

She holds the phone, is answered. Her voice more

natural, a little shy, a little covert.

INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: KLUTE - NIGHT

The tape-recorder continues turning and winking as

the conversation upstairs continues. KLUTE looks at

TV dinner. He reaches for the headset of the

taperecorder, holds it loosely against one ear. He

exhibits a measure of new interest. The TAPE

RECORDER stops running. He immediately rewinds, and

starts listening through it again. We CUT TO --

EXT. GARMENT DISTRICT - NIGHT

Large, dark buildings -- a DIM-LIGHTED WINDOW

showing at an upper floor of one -- the street

otherwise by and large deserted. A TAXI draws in, a

FIGURE IN EVENING DRESS (Bree) gets out, approaches

the building, glances around, either secretly or

apprehensively -- presses a buzzer, waits, gets

answering CLICKS, enters the dark hallway of the

building, starts upstairs.

EXT. ACROSS THE STREET - NIGHT

KLUTE shifts into view, looking in the direction

Bree's gone, a little puzzled all in all. He

doesn't immediately follow; he waits.

INT. GARMENT BUILDING - CUTTING ROOMS - NIGHT

We look past RACKS OF CLOTHING, as BREE arrives up

the dark stairway into dark rooms -- the scene,

mysterious, a little sinister. She seems fearful of

it herself, advances slowly, looking around, calls

-

ANGLE PAST MR. FABER, TO BREE

Mr. Faber is SILHOUETTED for a moment, standing,

watching her, from along an alleyway of garments.

She sees him, is startled then relieved.

He moves toward her.

REVERSE ANGLE, TO MR. FABER

Mr. Faber is a man of 65 or so, rather handsome,

and for this occasion very spruce, very erect, very

nattily turned out. Bree complains cheerfully.

He smiles, kisses her cheek, tests the fabric of

her evening dress -- (in passing, as a matter of

expertise).

Then he turns, lifts down a WOMAN'S DRESS CAPE,

carrying it -- graciously gestures her to precede

him --

CORNER OF CUTTING ROOM

A dim pool of light here. A private area here,

sectioned off by rows of garments. A couch, rug,

coffee table, a chair or two -- a place for Buyers

to take their ease. BREE and MR. FABER enter. Her

manner is suddenly elegant, assured, regal; his

befits a man of the world. He fits the cloak around

her shoulders and gestures to the couch; she sits.

He pours a glass of wine for her, for himself. She

speaks with a neat continental accent -- doing it

fairly well, really -- a member of the

international set.

He sits in the chair opposite, sips his wine.

She hesitates strangely, her fingers at the neck of

the cape. Faintly --

She stands, unloosing the cloak, letting it fall on

the couch. But she doesn't sit again -- begins to

move here and there about the enclosure, her hands

wandering about her dress and body -- an erotic

restlessness.

EXT. GARMENT BUILDING DOOR - NIGHT

KLUTE arrives from across the street. It takes him

a while (with a 'loid' probably) to slip the lock.

He eases door open, moves inside --

INT. CORNER OF CUTTING ROOM: BREE - NIGHT

BREE is farther along in her narrative, more

fervent in manner. MR. FABER sits at the edge of

his seat, ducking his head now and then in

pleasure, but making no move to molest her.

She casts away an accessory garment. Mr. Faber

burns her with his eyes --

INT. GARMENT BUILDING - CUTTING ROOMS - NIGHT

KLUTE mounts into view at the head of the stairs,

prowls along the aisles of clothing, looking --

sees --

POV PAST GARMENT RACKS TO MR. FABER

Klute sees Mr. Faber first -- clearly a senior

citizen -- sitting transfixed, fastened in some

private dream. Then BREE drifts into view -- stands

-- lets fall the evening dress about her ankles,

poses -- drifts out of view again --

KLUTE

Klute watches in that direction a moment longer. In

his expression a certain curiosity -- a prurience --

but rather more strongly, disappointment, a measure

of disgust. Not his affair. He turns away from it,

into camera, and --

EXT. BREE'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

Near the entrance, outside the door to KLUTE's

apartment below. We open on BREE. She shouts

angrily, miserably --

We WIDEN TO INCLUDE KLUTE. Now she begins to get

it. He turns, opens door to his room below. She

comes slowly down steps.

INT. KLUTE'S ROOM - DAY

She steps in the door, looks slowly around at his

various appurtenances -- the bed, the necktie over

the mirror, etc. -- and then, the TAPE RECORDER and

then the STACK OF TAPE BOXES. Softly, venomously --

But then she adjusts -- a frightened but matter-of

fact hooker --

She seems to have expressed it; the balance of

power. She turns, goes out, heads upstairs. Klute

unhurriedly takes up his folder of notes, then

follows.

INT. BREE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Bree disposes her belongings. Klute moves to table.

There is a group of plants on the table that long

since died of neglect. He notices them and the

disorganization of the room without comment, opens

his folder, rummages for the photographs. Then,

exasperatedly --

Klute doesn't respond. Klute sets out a photograph

for her to look at.

INSERT: PHOTOGRAPH TOM GRUNEMANN

KLUTE, BREE

Klute tosses down a second photograph.

INSERT: SECOND PHOTOGRAPH

Tom Grunemann, Elaine Grunemann, two daughters.

BREE, KLUTE

Klute grunts, meaning 'yes'. She echoes his grunt,

meaning we don't know what. He tosses another --

INSERT: WIDE PHOTOGRAPH - COMPANY PICNIC

An everybody-over-here, fellow-employees, sort of

picture. (Including the figures of Streiger and

Cable among many others, male and female.) The

usual impedimenta -- picnic baskets, balls, bats, a

held sign: 'Tole-American'. KLUTE'S FINGER

indicates --

KLUTE, BREE

She looks at the picture briefly, at him

questioningly.

She separates from Klute, around the table (but

remains standing, restless). Klute puts photo

aside, prepares to take notes, as she pleads --

She waits for Klute to respond -- he doodles

permissively on his pad of paper -- she goes on.

Without warning she wheels to the open windows, and

shouts out full-voiced -- both startling and

somewhat intriguing Klute --

Turns around again, to Klute. Cheerfully --

A brief pause. Klute sorts his notes. She may take

it that he's packing to leave -- hopes so anyhow.

For an instant we see the undefended girl

underneath --

Then again she changes manner -- remembering a

practical problem, approaching it as a matter-of

fact hooker.

She draws back again. Up to now she's been

reasonably on top of things. Starting now we see

her driven toward the things she'd really rather

not talk about -- and increasingly more shaken.

The PHONE RINGS. She startles. Then approaches with

some difficulty -- but then answers with complete

calm in her Smith-girl voice.

A BUZZING from the phone; the connection abruptly

broken. She hangs up, recites.

Klute takes up the slip of paper previously given

him by Trask. In the same manner as before --

She freezes again, looking at him. Then savagely --

She chokes -- then goes on --

She grabs up the company picture, raging on --

Something in his inflection -- very slight --

cautions her. She falls silent as suddenly as she

began. Then cheerfully --

She wanders away toward a bureau. Her shirt seems

to itch her; she scratches her ribs. Then opens

drawer, takes out a different shirt as --

She pulls off her shirt, unhooks her brassiere and

discards it, apparently quite unselfconscious.

Klute reacts; then, carefully maintaining his cool

-

She turns to him in total innocence, holding the

shirt rather carelessly in front of her -- a new

attack.

At this point -- or about this point -- Klute takes

note of something. A little above her. He grows

more watchful, but containing it carefully. We

don't understand the change in his manner -- or

even notice; she doesn't. In mock dismay --

He has risen, is approaching her slowly -- carrying

his notes as if to check something. She is hopeful

again --

She gasps, terrified -- immediately -- almost

beyond control. He taps the pencil on his notes.

She manages to take hold of a corner of the notes,

trembling. He goes on --

He strolls away from her. His destination is the

area of the door -- out of view from the skylight --

from where he can head for the roof. But he doesn't

head that way directly -- first takes a turn in

another direction, his bearing casual. Prompting --

Klute has strolled out of view from above --

instantly flattens himself against the wall, eases

the door open, about to slip and charge. As Bree

labors on --

INT. LANDING AND LADDER TO ROOF - NIGHT

FOOTSTEPS across the roof above, as the watcher

discovers Klute's ruse. Klute opens the door --

climbs ladder to roof.

EXT. ROOFTOPS - NIGHT

-- Klute out, looking around --

EXT. ROOFTOPS: PAST KLUTE TO FLEEING FIGURE - NIGHT

The figure -- the man -- scissoring over the low

walls where one brownstone joins another. Klute

gives chase -- over ridges, past water tanks,

oddments of roof furniture --

EXT. SEVERAL ROOFTOPS BEYOND - NIGHT

The FIGURE races to a roof door disappearing into

abandoned building.

INT. STAIRWELL - ABANDONED BUILDING

CAMERA follows KLUTE as he cautiously makes his way

down the stairwell of the boarded up old

brownstone. He gets to the first floor. He can see

no exit in the building. He opens door that leads

to a narrow staircase into the cellar.

INT. CELLAR - ABANDONED BROWNSTONE

It is as black as a dungeon and as low. He lights a

match, but sees no one. There is a sound of

movement coming from the floor above, He runs up

the steps to the floor above and sees a very faint

light coming through one of the closed apartment

doors. Carefully takes out a gun and then with one

quick movement he breaks through the door.

INT. ABANDONED APARTMENT

The walls, ceiling, floors are entirely covered

with crudely painted psychedelic signs and sayings.

The room is lighted by some candies stuck in

bottles. Sitting on a blanket on the floor are

several teenaged boys and girls having a pot party.

They have obviously made a clubhouse for themselves

in the abandoned house. It is a MOOT POINT whether

they or KLUTE is more stunned at the sight that

faces them. He puts his gun away in embarrassment.

Again he has been made to feel like an awkward

peeping tom in this hidden world of the city.

INT. CELLAR - ABANDONED BUILDING

CAMERA wanders restlessly through the blackness and

stops at a pinpoint of light coming through a low

door. CAMERA goes through opening into long narrow

furnace room with the ceiling so low that an

ordinary man could not stand up. We hear the sound

of breathing. CAMERA follows the sound through the

darkness revealing a sweaty man huddled in the

corner looking like some strange animal from a

painting by Bosch. It is Cable.

INT. BREE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Bree has wrapped herself in the quilt -- standing

up against a corner shivering, immobilized. We hear

KLUTE'S FOOTSTEPS DESCENDING -- she flinches -- he

enters.

He sees her condition. Gently --

He reaches to touch her -- she quails away from

him.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST BUILDINGS - DAY

A shot catching the edge of CENTRAL PARK itself --

our first small view of greenery -- to the tall, be

limousined APARTMENT BUILDINGS OF C.P.W. The

FIGURES OF KLUTE, BREE walking upstreet, turning

under one of the canopies -- (Klute carries a

zipper book-case).

INT. APARTMENT HOUSE LOBBY - ON DOORMAN AT PHONE -

DAY

The DOORMAN hangs up the brass house-phone, smiles

and gestures them graciously into the (self

service) ELEVATOR. We see Klute -- without making

too much of it -- taking in the mirrors and marble

work.

INT. ELEVATOR (MOVING): KLUTE, BREE

She breaks the silence.

Silence.

INT. LIGOURIN'S APARTMENT: ON DOOR - DAY

The BUZZER sounding, FRANK LIGOURIN crossing to

open the door for BREE, KLUTE. Cheerful,

hospitable, nice, unpretentious.

The point of this one brief shot -- Bree's face --

in the instant after Frank has spoken and before

she enters, with Klute following. Her half-second

of hesitation. This is someone who gets to her

somehow -- probably always will.

WIDER LIGOURIN'S APT: THREESHOT - DAY

The apartment is as expected -- but not overdone; a

certain small amount of someone-lives-here litter.

A few, large but not very good, ABSTRACTIONS on the

walls. There is a large TABLE covered over with

photographs and mock-ups of magazine pages, a felt

board or easel with lettering samples -- Frank's

props really.

Short silence. Then with the tact of a gentleman

dealing with rude, difficult woman --

He gestures gently to indicate outside. She nods

once. He escorts her in that direction, OUT the

door, closing it behind them.

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE LIGOURIN'S APARTMENT - DAY

He escorts her to the elevator, pushes the down

button for her. In silence so far. Then, quietly --

as one who knows the other's thoughts --

She shrugs a shoulder at him, looks away. He goes

on in the same quiet voice.

She yanks at the elevator doors. But the elevator's

not here yet. She turns away sharply into the door

marked "Stairway". He turns back to his apartment.

INT. LIGOURIN'S APARTMENT - DAY

Frank reenters, with the calm smile of troop

chaplain.

He gestures Klute to one chair, sits in another,

waits calmly, attentively.

Klute waits.

INT. APARTMENT HOUSE LOBBY: BREE - DAY

BREE sits, looks with curiosity at housewives her

age -- bringing their children in from the park, as

if trying to imagine what their lives could be

like. KLUTE emerges from elevator.

EXT. STREET (TWO SHOT) - DAY

At the corner he slows, starts unzipping his

bookcase as if indicating a change of route.

He hands over the TAPE-REELS.

She turns smartly away, deposits the tapes in

passing in a litter box, departs. Klute looks after

her for a moment, then turns on his way. Then --

EXT. POV THROUGH LITTERBOX IN FOREGROUND TO POV OF

FIGURES OF KLUTE, BREE - DAY

This shot holds both in view for a moment, until

they both disappear separately in the traffic.

CAMERA moves in slightly on litterbox as a man's

hand comes into frame and removes the tapes.

INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: KLUTE - NIGHT

Klute, in pajama bottoms, lies in bed. A miserably

hot humid night. KNOCK at the door. He answers.

BREE stands in the doorway in bare feet.

She walks in past him, sits down on the edge of his

bed.

He takes her seriously, starts to move.

He starts for the bed, as if to lift her onto her

feet. She takes off her robe and swings her legs

up, and under the sheet.

Under the sheet she unlooses her pajama bottoms,

kicks them away, starts unbuttoning the shirt.

He tries to rebutton the pajama shirt. She catches

his hand, thrusts it underneath. In grief and anger

--

UPSHOT, C.U.

Their bodies lock together descending toward camera

--

DOWNSHOT, C.U. SAME ACTION

Her hands slide about his shoulders. She is

laughing softly, affectionately, mockingly --

C.U., HER FACE

-- triumphantly, contemptuously, orgiastically --

FACES

Klute gasps deeply -- entering orgasm. As soon as

she hears it, judges it, she drops her hands from

his shoulders, stills her own movements, lies

utterly passive, smiling calmly, letting him finish

for himself. He can't stop -- cries out -- cries

out again, burying his face against her -- is done.

Then he slowly raises up, shuddering, looking down

at her. He knows what she's done to him, is

helpless to do anything back. He rolls slowly out

of the embrace of her legs and lies silently --

looking upward, very much as we saw him at start of

scene.

FAVORIVG BREE

She waits, still smiling, for a while. But she's

not done with him yet. She rolls to lie with her

upper body on his, trailing her fingers across his

face. Affectionately, as a good whore --

She sits up, gropes her pajamas from the floor,

puts them on. In the same fond tone --

She has the pajamas and robe on, pauses near the

door --

INT. THEATRE: READING SCENE - DAY

A WIDE SHOT. An open casting call in an Off

Broadway Theatre. Darkness, except for the work

light onstage. A small GROUP there -- onstage --

including the figure of BREE. Just offstage, the

figures of DIRECTOR (JANG) and a PRODUCER. And the

rest of the theatre, the audience section, dotted

with the heads of ACTORS, ACTRESSES waiting for

their turns. Bree's voice rings out across the

gloom.

CLOSER, ONSTAGE

The others stand rigid as statues, facing dead

front -- an experimental drama, clearly -- all

holding scripts, as Bree hastens from one to

another, fiercely, imploringly --

All break posture, start offstage, while Bree,

caught in mid-stride, clowns it a little.

-- then toward Jang, a bit succinctly, indicating

script --

WIDER, near stage front.

Bree shrugs, steps down off stage with the others.

Bree finds Jang's hand out for her script, smiles

wanly, turns it over, continues on out of scene.

She finds something - someone -- impeding her way.

Looks up.

PAST BREE TO KLUTE

Klute has edged out into the aisle to intercept

her.

EXT. THEATRE ENTRANCE: GREENWICH VILLAGE - DAY

Bree comes out, turns.

Pause. Impasse.

She examines him -- shrugs -- turns, proceeds along

the sidewalk, Klute accompanying --

EXT. DISCOTHEQUE - NIGHT

In the small hours. The same place seen previously,

the gathering place. KLUTE, BREE arriving and

entering.

INT. DISCOTHEQUE - NIGHT

Klute and Bree head toward the rear. Her arrival

causes a little stir. She exchanges greetings with

one or two, is watched by others.

Bree leads on to where --

PAST KLUTE, BREE TO TRINA

TRINA sits alone at a rear table -- anything but a

whore in appearance -- a quietly beautiful,

immaculately dressed woman of about thirty.

Trina undergoes a change of demeanor. Flatly --

INT. ANOTHER LATE NIGHT SPOT - NIGHT

We dolly with KLUTE & BREE as they walk in front of

a row of tables. This night spot is totally black

except for a series of huge slide projections on

the wall in back of the tables. The slides, which

change every few seconds are elegant

representations of the beautiful people living the

good life as seen in such magazines as VOGUE, TOWN

& COUNTRY & HARPERS BAZAAR. The customers sitting

in the darkness below provide a direct contrast to

the pictures in back. The silhouette figures of

BREE & KLUTE stop at a table seating three people,

two call girls and a pimp. CAMERA moves in.

The pimp looks distrustfully at Klute who reassures

--

INT. JANIE DALE'S PENTHOUSE

It is a very small penthouse. KLUTE & BREE stand in

the small living room waiting for JANIE DALE. There

are two very casually dressed prostitutes sitting

around the living room. One sits at an upright

piano playing of all things STRANGERS IN THE NIGHT.

Another one sits on a couch talking to a Wall

Street Broker who is spending his lunch hour. KLUTE

finds himself staring down into a pile of

pornography magazines on the coffee table. BREE is

amused at his discomfort.

JANIE DALE, the madame, who has been on the phone

in the back, puts the receiver down and crosses to

the girl on the couch. JANIE looks and talks a bit

like Lauren Bacall.

GIRL on couch rises.

She shrugs and turns to KLUTE & BREE.

THIS IS A CHEAPER APARTIENT THAN JANIE DALE'S

The girls look cheaper, and the customers, rather

than Wall Street lawyers and brokers, look more

like out of town salesmen who stay at local motor

inns.

MOMMA REESE is older than JANIE DALE, heavier and

with no pretense at chic. She indicates that she

has not seen ARLYN in some time.

INT. EIGHT AVENUE BAR - ABOUT 4 IN THE MORNING

This is a hangout where black and white pimps wait

to meet their whores after their night of street

walking. This streetwalker world is far removed

from the world of the call girl or the world of

Janie Dale. CAMERA pans past a group of pimps at

the bar taking bet on whose girls have made the

most money that night. CAMERA then goes on to

reveal KLUTE talking to another pimp (Azure). Azure

represents a clear step down from Frank Ligourin.

We catch only part of their dialogue.

We START FADE SOUND as Klute repeats --

-- and CUT TO --

INT. LINGERIE SHOP: PROPRIETRESS, BREE, KLUTE

Again we fade sound a little before picture, then

CUT TO --

EXT. OUTSIDE ADULT MOVIE THEATER: KLUTE,

STREETWALKERS - DAY OR NIGHT

Outside Theatre or Bookstore - Peepshow; an 8th

Avenue establishment. SILENT ACTION this (or VOICES

UNDER). Klute confers with one girl who summons and

consults another. They seem to know of Arlyn --

haven't seen her recently -- refer him elsewhere --

EXT. APARTMENT HOUSE: MRS. VASEK, KLUTE - DAY

A shabby place in a shabby neighborhood. Mrs.

Vasek, the landlady, shifts barrels at the same

time that she barks at Klute, in heavy accent.

We see Klute persisting - DISSOLVE

EXT. WIDE SHOT: SLUM STREET - DAY

We still HOLD WIDE to establish the scene. This is

a genuine slum. We see Bree, Klute move along

street. We see Bree drop back a little, Klute

waiting for her to catch up.

EXT. STREET: BREE, KLUTE

He starts on, simply assuming that she'll follow.

(There is a degree of acquaintanceship in their

manners now - a reluctant collaboration.)

-- and follows on. He checks numbers, then crosses

street diagonally toward a half-framed house.

INT. NEWARK HOUSE - DAY

A downshot from second floor level toward the entry

way where KLUTE & BREE appear. KLUTE strikes a

match to inspect the names of tenants. He and Bree

climb through stench and litter to the second floor

-- a door. From somewhere near at hand come the

sounds of someone RETCHING. A square of wood has

been sawed out of the door itself, removing handle

and lock -- light sifts through. Klute hesitates,

decides against knocking, pushes in.

INT. ARLYN'S APARTMENT - DAY

The retching sounds are coming from the connecting

room. No one visible here. A very few barren pieces

of furniture. We hear ARLYN'S VOICE ask from the

next room --

ARLYN enters rather eagerly. She sees Klute first,

then Bree -- recognizes her -- retires flat against

a wall, holding one palm outwards to shield her

face. She is unbelievably gaunt. Inside one elbow,

looking rather like a birthmark, we see a lacework

of purple where her veins have pulped together.

From the connecting room a MAN'S VOICE (Berger's)

calling out hoarsely.

BERGER hastens, stumbles, into the doorframe

carrying a CAR-RADIO with wires dangling, speaks

before he sees them.

He stops for an instant face-to-face with Klute.

Then turns, plunges out of view again. Arlyn breaks

after.

We hear the MUMBLE and WHISPER of their voices from

the connecting room (as she reassures him). Bree

looks inquiringly at Klute (is that Grunemann?): he

shakes his head. Pause, then ARLYN reenters,

wrapping her fingers together timidly -- wanting

them out -- her only purpose.

Arlyn seems to accept the bargain. He indicates to

Bree to proceed, stands away a little. Arlyn covers

her elbow with one hand. Bree manages as best she

can.

Klute hands Grunemann's picture to Bree: Bree shows

it to Arlyn. Arlyn inspects it, then uncertainly,

weakly --

We hear FOOTSTEPS - UNDER, DIMLY - mounting the

stairs. Bree notices them first, Klute persisting

with Arlyn --

Arlyn catches the footsteps, dodges past him toward

the door, intending to reassure --

-- as the pusher, CAPPY, steps in. All of this is

very quick, simultaneous, a confusion of voices.

CAPPY takes one look at Klute --

-- turns and runs.

Cappy's FOOTSTEPS race away down the stairs. BERGER

plunges out from the connecting room, still

carrying the car radio, shouting, pursuing --

We hear him STUMBLE AND FALL on the stairs outside,

the sound of body reeling down. Arlyn shrieks and

races after: Klute and Bree follow.

INT. HOUSE: LOWER HALL - DAY

We see BERGER lying at the foot of the stairs. As

Arlyn clatters down toward him, Berger sways up

onto his knees. His nose is bloodied, he cries.

Arlyn casts herself on her knees beside him, pulls

his face against her, croons to him, soothes and

tends him.

Klute and Bree are only a half-step behind. Klute

offers to assist: Arlyn puts him away ferociously.

We DISSOLVE TO --

INT. SUBWAY TRAIN: REFLECTION IN WINDOW OF BREE AND

KLUTE SITTING SIDE BY SIDE

CAMERA moves in closer so we only see reflection of

BREE looking at herself and at the world seeming to

speed by at an inhuman pace as the lights of the

tunnel zoom past her face. What she sees is the

figure of a woman with life screaming past her out

of control.

INT. SUBWAY

SUBWAY slows to a stop and a door opens. BREE sits

with KLUTE staring at the open door and then

without warning - gets up and runs off the train.

The door closes, leaving KLUTE locked in the train.

SUBWAY EXIT

SHOT of BREE's feet rushing up the stairs in

darkness and then quick cut to her face as she hits

the sunlight. She pauses for a moment - relieved to

be out of the darkness.

EXT. ROOFTOP OF BREE'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

CAMERA pans from night view of New York City to

KLUTE sitting on the rooftop alone as if trying to

comprehend all he has seen, the mystery of TOM

GRUNEMANN's disappearance in this world and the

mysteries of the behavior of BREE.

SKYLIGHT INTO BREE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Alongside of him the skylight of BREE's apartment

lights up. He looks through the skylight and sees

BREE enter her apartment. He can hear BREE talking

to somebody, and then he sees that she is talking

to FRANK LIGOURIN.

KLUTE watches through the skylight and hears bits

and pieces of the scene between BREE and FRANK. He

sees the same kind of symbiosis, the same kind of

parody of loving that he saw between ARLYN &

BERGER. As the scene becomes more intimate he

leaves.

INT. CABLE'S (CITY) OFFICE: ON KLUTE - DAY

The pristine, antiseptic, elegance off CABLE'S

office is in its own way as unreal and dehumanized

as the sexual underworld KLUTE has been exploring

with BREE, and KLUTE looks as out of place in the

one as he does in the other. TRASK sits beside

KLUTE facing CABLE who is impeccably dressed. He is

the total image of the executive in control.

CABLE'S SECRETARY appears for a moment tapping her

watch significantly.

They rise, dismissed. He sorts a paper or two,

continues to Klute.

KLUTE and TRASK depart.

CABLE closes the door and returns to his desk. He

pulls out a tape recorder from a drawer in his

desk, rewinds it and turns it on. We hear a

playback of the previous scene with KLUTE and

TRASK. He stands at the window listening with some

satisfaction; as if listening to what KLUTE

revealed keeps him in control of the situation.

EXT. WINDOW - CABLE'S OFFICE - DAY

The CAMERA pulls back from a CU of CABLE standing

at the window to a wide angle looking at CABLE

through the window. The window is 30 or 40 stories

high. The wide angle lens almost makes the building

look like it is standing on point, and CABLE, a man

suspended in space.

EXT. WIDE SHOT: DOCKS - DAY

A TUGBOAT has pulled in. The SOUND of its heavy

ENGINES, IDLING, runs underneath this entire

sequence. A POLICE VEHICLE or two has parked at the

head of the dock. We see several figures on the

rear deck of the tug, but it's not clear at this

distance what they're doing. The POLICE CAR WITH

KLUTE arrives. He dismounts and proceeds from dock

to tug-deck.

EXT. TUGBOAT DECK: GROUP - DAY

TRASK glances toward Klute as he arrives, but

doesn't greet him. His attention, like the others,

is directed downward and

off-scene (to the surface of the water actually,

just outboard of the tug). We see beside Trask TWO

Uniformed Cops (SUGARMAN and SPENCE) and DECKHANDS.

And we hear, along with the throbbing of the

engines, a stirring about of the water and a

peculiar third noise -- rather commingled with the

engines -- which we can't at first identify.

Klute joins the group, watches.

SPENCE brings into view, and shakes out, a giant

neoprene body bag. INSTRUCTIONS among the group AD

LIB, UNDER --

SUGARMAN brings into view a METAL BASKET attached

with short ropes. He complains --

They slip the basket downward, out of frame (into

the water).

We CUT TO -

BERGER - DAY

We see Berger sitting huddled against the tugboat

cabin -- we haven't seen him before -- with his

hands bunched in front of his mouth. We identify

the noise which may have puzzled us before -- his

SOBBING.

DOWNSHOT: SURFAICE OF WATER, BASKET, BODY

We catch a fleeting glimpse of the body being

lifted, just before it breaks the surface of the

water.

FAVORING KLUTE

Klute looks on as EFFECTS trace the processing of

the body. SPENCE kneels down out of frame to slide

the bag around it. TRASK kneels down to make a

brief examination -- straightens again. To Klute --

We MOVE WITH KLUTE as he turns and moves away a few

feet along deck. Here he stands. Then SUGARMAN

moves into view holding a clipboard. Routinely --

He indicates the direction of Berger. Klute

examines the clipboard data.

He spits, moves back in the direction of the group;

Klute continues to stand. BERGER moves in his

direction. Brokenly --

Klute doesn't understand his purport, reacts

instantly, sympathetically --

Klute stares at him -- a quiet horror -- as Berger

insists --

Klute shoves a bill in his hand, turns away very

sharply, off the tugboat.

EXT. DOCK: KLUTE - DAY

Klute walks a longer distance this time, sits down

on one of the pilings of the dock. Watching him we

see what might be a profound awe and grief at all

these things -- but is, in fact, a good deal more.

EFFECTS, O.S. as Police Vehicles are loaded, driven

away and as tug toots, runs up engines, puts out

again.

TRASK moves into scene, sits on another piling,

looks at him speculatively. Silence. Then --

Then -- (we are assuming a complete understanding

here between Klute and Trask, non-verbal. What

Trask is asking, in effect, is: is this meaningful?

Do we both suspect the same man?)

INT. BREE'S APARTMENT - DAY

It is late afternoon, but BREE is in her pajamas

curled up in her bed. There are some magazines

scattered around the bed and the television set is

on an old movie. There are cracker crumbs in the

bed and a cup of coffee and an open jar of peanut

butter with the knife sticking out of the jar on

the floor by the bed. It would seem that BREE has

spent most of the day in bed. She looks like an

unkempt child. The phone is ringing, but she does

not answer it. The phone no sooner stops than the

door bell rings. Reluctantly she gets out of bed

and goes to the door. She looks through the spy

hole and sees Klute's face. She undoes two locks

and an obviously new chain and bolt and opens the

door.

He barely enters the room. His manner is cool and

remote.

Klute looks around the disorderly room. The plants

in the windowsill have never been in worse shape.

They look as if she deliberately let them die of

thirst.

Klute goes.

INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT - DAY

The empty apartment. He enters, switches a light on

(dusk), tosses aside jacket, bookcase, etc., then

sits down on the edge of his bed, with one foot

propped up on it.

FOOTSTEPS and A RAP at the door. He looks up, but

doesn't move, doesn't answer. BREE opens it,

enters. There are tear-tracks down her face, but

she's no longer crying. She tries to smile, tries

to explain her wants. Then with the unhurried,

graven composure of absolute desperation, she sits

on the edge of the bed.

She pushes up her sleeve, points at tiny spot on

her arm - a freckle. He peers at it then at her

puzzledly.

Klute looks at it again. Judiciously --

He shows her a spot or two on his own forearm. She

compares, is reassured. Embarrassedly, she tries to

smile. It is unsuccessful. She gets up and moves

about. Her manner in general is totally unguarded,

honest, undramatic, searching.

He only grunts. A sound like 'OK' or 'all right' --

an invitation to leave. But she won't be driven

away. More urgently, helplessly:

She's left the door a little ajar. He widens it for

her.

She pushes it out of his hand, pushes it shut. A

little more angrily:

She accepts it decently. Tries to smile again,

nods.

She gestures, tries to find something more to say,

moves by degrees toward the door -- and would

succeed in leaving. But then:

Standing still, she starts again to cry -- and

bravely to keep the crying to herself. The child

bereft. He contends with himself, then crosses to

her, puts his arms around her, soothes her hair. A

completely asexual gesture at this point, a giving

of comfort. She clings, trembles, burrows. Then --

a SERIES OF DISSOLVES: The street outside, at

different times of night interposed, with Bree and

Klute at different times of love, As Follows:

EXT. THE STREET - DAY

The street as we saw it just previously... still

daylight... still somewhat populated, but drawing

toward dusk.

INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: BPEE, KLUTE - NIGHT

Darkness now, or close to dark; the room heavily

shadowed. Bree and Klute sit together on the bed.

He still strokes her hair. He has pulled a blanket

around her shoulders. The transaction is still not

overtly sexual, but the tenderness is more overt.

He rubs his cheek against her forehead. She herself

is quieter, comforted. She begins to stir against

him.

EXT. THE STREET - NIGHT

The street at night. Eleven o'clock, let's say.

Some lit windows; a single car moving past.

EXT. THE STREET - NIGHT

All the windows dark this time. The deepest night,

just before the sky begins to lighten.

INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: BREE, KLUTE - NIGHT

Klute is alseep -- more or less -- on his stomach.

Bree beside him lies awake. She trails her fingers

about his back. A rather tentative, exploratory

business. Her expression is more wondering than

anything else -- what does she have here, and can

she get used to it?

EXT. THE STREET - DAY (DAWN)

The street's first stirrings. From not far off, the

sounds of trash cans being collected.

INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: BREE, KLUTE - DAY (DAWN)

Klute half sits up in bed. Bree is fast asleep with

her head pillowed on his midsection. Some humor in

this shot: he wants to move but doesn't want to

wake her. At a point he risks it, reaches out for

something beside the bed. Her eyes open

immediately. He puts his hand on her face, trying

gently to press her back.

But she takes his hand -- and retains it -- rolls

onto her back. Still relaxed, but a little more

separate, thoughtful -- a mixture of the Bree we've

seen before and the Bree we've glimpsed, the

possible Bree. She observes:

She grins, then starts to reach for him, still

receptive -- then feels another (and genuine) pang,

turns her head away sharply.

He looks at her with concern, but only caresses

her. She manages to explain --

He settles himself beside her, makes overtures. She

responds, but:

She pretends to bite -- they tussle -- she feels a

suddenly growing excitement, seizes him. Fiercely,

welcomingly, full out.

And we cut directly to:

INT. SPANGLER'S OFFICE: BREE, SPANGLER - DAY

Bree standing, angry, antagonistic, demanding. In a

way -- a Bree-like way -- she's seized psychiatry

by the throat.

She waits. Spangler says nothing.

EXT. THE PLAZA OF LINCOLN CENTER

Sunlight is beaming on the graceful fountains and

elegant architecture.

Groups of cheerful tourists are admiring the

civilized monuments to man's search for culture.

CAMERA pans to ugly street across the way revealing

Klute approaching and entering a dingy warehouse

topped by an absurdly placed copy of the Statue of

Liberty. This is the municipal storehouse.

INT. MUNICIPAL STOREHOUSE - DAY

The abrupt cut from the bright sunlight leaves us

in almost total darkness as we follow KLUTE. We are

in a huge storeroom. As we grow accustomed to the

darkness we see bits and pieces of incongruous

objects scattered along Klute's path - old pieces

of furniture, lamps, piggy banks, etc. - the

remnants of the lives of the plundered, the

destroyed and the dispossessed. Some is stolen

property, some evidence for homicide cases, and

some the unclaimed possessions of the unclaimed

dead.

A CUSTODIAN -- an ancient retainer sort, a civil

servant, leads KLUTE into an old elevator cage.

INT. ELEVATOR

Klute and Custodian as elevator ascends; looking up

the elevator shaft through the open cage we see a

series of doors hanging over space seeming to lead

nowhere. The whole sequence has the feeling of a

dream of being lost in a black limbo.

Klute and Custodian leave elevator on higher floor

and walk down the long very low corridor past rows

of locked vault doors. The Custodian stops at one

and opens it. We are in a small dungeon-like room

filled with banks of files from floor to ceiling.

The Custodian counts to himself --

Custodian finds it, unlocks for Klute's inspection.

Reaches for paper Klute's holding.

Klute pokes through a small collection of personal

effects -- perhaps an ankle bracelet, rabbits foot,

faded snapshot of a child, some letters, pitiful

remnants of Jane McKenna's life. Klute closes the

drawer, and the front of the drawer is marked

McKENNA, JANE?

Over the visual material of Klute's trip through

the warehouse we hear WILD TRACK VOICE OVER bits

and pieces of BREE talking with the psychiatrist.

INT. PROJECTION ROOM - MISSING PERSONS BUREAU

On the left a portion of the original obscene

letter. On the right a series of comparison

documents -- beginning with a portion of a personal

letter. We hear TRASK'S, KLUTE'S VOICES OVER, and

occasionally cut to them as --

The right-hand document is switched.

KLUTE, TRASK

Klute reacts.

Then -- with subdued satisfaction, switching the

projector again.

SCREEN; DOCUMENTS

KLUTE & TRASK - STARING AT PROJECTIONS

As Klute talks he paces back and forth in the

darkness. He crosses in front of the lighted

screen; the letters projected on the screen ripple

over his face.

INT. MISSING PERSONS BUREAU

Klute and Trask are seen entering from the

Projection Room. In the background we see an old

black woman sitting in front of the picture file of

unidentified dead, carefully studying each picture.

In the foreground Klute sits down at a phone and

dials.

CAMERA goes in close on Klute.

There is a silence. Both Klute and Cable seem to be

waiting for one or the other to make the next move.

Klute hangs up.

The old black lady motions to Trask who crosses to

her. She points to a picture in the file. She has

obviously found her missing person among the

photographs of the unidentified dead. She starts to

stand but then sits again, obviously shaken.

Klute crosses to her and gently helps her out of

the chair. He sees in her face the same sense of

loss he feels for his friend.

EXT. OUTDOOR MARKETS - EIGHT AVENUE - NIGHT

KLUTE & BREE

Bree examining and feeling fruit in some imitation

of a very shrewd and experienced housewife shopper.

She is obviously enjoying her sense of domesticity,

and Klute is amused by her enjoyment.

OUTDOOR NURSERY - EIGHT AVENUE - NEXT TO MARKET

The nursery is an absurdly cheerful spot of

greenery in the midst of the dirty chaos of the

avenue.

Klute and Bree wander through the plants.

She is like a child awaiting praise from her

teacher. Klute says nothing. They continue walking

among the plants and he picks up a few that she had

admired.

Considering his contempt for all the dead plant

life he has seen in her apartment in the past, she

is pleased by this act of belief in her.

EXT. BROWNSTONE ENTRYWAY - NIGHT

Bree, Klute approach unhurriedly along the

sidewalk. She is holding his arm, HUMS to herself,

enjoys the evening.

INT. STAIRWALL - NIGHT

We follow them up.

INT. ANGLE INTO BREE APARTMENT - NIGHT

The apartment is a shambles -- furniture

overturned, decorations ripped from the wall,

bedding scattered and ripped.

INT. BREE APARTMENT - NIGHT

Klute jettisons the grocery bags, thrusts himself

inside, looks quickly about, finds no one. Bree

follows more slowly, whispering:

He moves quickly to the rear of the apartment,

looks at the rear window which has been broken

inward in a litter of glass -- then returns to the

table at the front of the apartment; his folders.

Bree cracks wise, unsteadily.

ANGLE TO TABLE; FOLDERS

The contents of the folders have been spilled

across the table and -- we ZOOM IN -- the

photographs of Tom Grunemann sorted out and ripped

apart, Even the COMPANY PICNIC photograph has been

painstakingly torn, specifically to destroy the

image of Grunemann in the front row.

KLUTE

He stands, looking down, taking no notice as --

Then a moment later, she cries out again, more

sharply:

He turns quickly. She is holding out, at arms

length, a pair of her underpants. With a disgust so

extreme she can only laugh.

She doesn't respond. He seizes her arm, shakes the

garment back onto the floor. She starts to gag,

slaps her hand over her mouth, starts for the

bathroom. Klute yanks her back.

She twists free of his hands, backs away. The same

elementary terror we've seen before.

She's broken for the door; it's questionable that

she's even heard him. He hasn't time to pursue --

shouts again --

Then he turns back into the apartment.

INT. BREE'S APARTMENT - DAY

A DOWNSHOT TO UNDERPANTS (as if from Klute's POV,

connecting directly to the previous shot) -- then a

FLASHBULB goes off and a hand and pair of tongs

enter frame and flip the garment into a collecting

box and we widen to reveal that it's now daylight

and the scene has been invaded by POLICE

TECHNICIANS. One is a photographer; another, a

fingerprint man, is spraying surfaces with a can of

fixative. In the foreground Klute and Trask are

talking with Ross, the FBI man. Ross is looking

through a dossier on Cable that Klute has compiled.

Over the following conversation we show CLOSEUPS of

material in the dossier. It contains photographs of

Cable and his life from childhood to the present -

including pictures of him with his mother and

father - she a very dominant looking lady and he a

very passive looking man;

also graduation pictures and pictures with his

former wife taken when he was still a very young

man. They are the personal images of a life time.

The Technicians, meanwhile have packed to depart.

The first Technician scoops the torn up photographs

into another collecting box. Trask retrieves the

company outing photograph.

Trask eyes Klute for a moment, as if a querying his

relationship with Bree. Klute is clearly

unresponsive. Trask resumes.

Klute starts gathering his papers we CUT TO --

INT. STAIRWELL: BREE - DAY

Bree coming up the stairs meets the Technicians

coming down -- stands aside to let them pass --

starts up again and comes face to face with Klute.

On her part we see a wish to be reconciled -- a

shyness mixed with defiance -- but Klute's manner

is arduous. She smiles nervously, asks --

He nods; she starts by. Then --

Pause. Then, evenly --

She starts on, then turns back toward him -- rather

pleadingly --

She continues on up; Klute continues down.

INT. BREE'S APARTMENT - DAY

Entering without greeting Trask (his manner is not

uncivil but simply neutral, unreacting, Cop-like)

she quickly gathers up a few properties, a change

of shoes.

She spins around -- mute -- terrified.

He coerces her to the table and unrolls the Company

outing picture. (We see the rip extending up

through the image of Tom Grunemann in the front

row.)

Trask has clamped his thumb over the torn image of

Grunemann, indicates with the other hand --

We see her comply -- her eyes moving over the rows

of faces. Then we see her stiffen, hear her gasp --

-- and WE CUT TO --

INT. DOWNTOWN HELIPORT - DAY

Cable welcomes Klute. His outer manner is warm,

voluble, congratulatory --

Sometime -- right along about now -- it privately

comes to Cable that Klute may know everything and

that he, Cable, may be being trapped.

HELICOPTER FLIGHT is announced over loud speaker

and Cable and Klute walk onto field.

EXT. HELICOPTER FIELD

People are boarding helicopter.

Klute is momentarily at a loss -- not a question

he'd prepared for -- improvises.

Cable takes an instant to compute the thing. Then --

ATTENDANT comes over to motion Cable onto the

helicopter.

Klute smiles awkwardly, raises his hand in a

goodbye gesture.

INT. HELICOPTER

Cable sits down next to window. The helicopter

begins to rise. CAMERA goes into a medium close

shot of Cable against the helicopter window. The

helicopter ascends in front of a very tall office

building made up of endless glass squares. A

telephoto lens brings the glass squares of the

building directly against Cable's head and

shoulders giving us the feeling that Cable is

almost levitating by himself. As one floor after

another disappears behind him we see an almost

manic exhultation in Cable's face; as if he is on

top of things once more.

EXT. STREET OUTSIDE BROWNSTONE - DAY

We bring Klute along street, and into the

Brownstone.

INT. STAIRWELL - DAY

Klute climbs the stairs to Bree's apartment --

knocks. He waits. No answer. He calls once --

No answer. He starts downstairs again -- then turns

back, unlocks the door himself, enters.

INT. BREE'S APARTMENT - DAY

The room is still disordered. Bree and Frank

Ligourin look at him, silently. Bree has been

assembling armfuls of dresses to carry away with

her. Frank sits nearby in a chair. Klute smiles a

little -- almost apologetically.

Bree doesn't answer. She sets the armload of

dresses over the back of a chair, moves aside to

get others. Frank smiles cautiously, ruefully. Then

--

He still doesn't extract an answer. She returns

with other dresses.

He continues to look at her; she continues to

gather possessions. Then trying to smile, to deal

with it casually --

He thinks better of continuing. Klute looks from

him back to Bree. He speaks gravely, spacing his

words -- unable to speak any faster.

Frank rises, both nervous and offended -- but

dealing with Klute as between civilized men.

Smiling.

Klute hits him, pursues, recovers, and starts to

beat him. BLOOD thickly descends the side of

Frank's face, as he struggles away. Bree is

screaming. Bree grabs at him from behind. He

thrusts her off. But it allows Frank to break away

through the still-open door. Klute pursues.

INT. LANDING AT DOOR - DAY

Frank clatters down a stairs as Klute arrives in

the doorframe, and as Bree, behind Klute, screams --

Klute is restrained -- restrains himself. Frank has

faced around on the stairs, still bleeding

extravagantly from his torn scalp. Earnestly --

Klute start's out after him -- Frank vaults away

down the stairs -- we hear him stumbling and

running -- Klute faces sharply around into the

apartment.

INT. BREE'S APARTMENT - DAY

PAST KLUTE TO BREE. She is running away from him

again, to a corner of the apartment, fumbling at a

sewing basket. He starts in, after her.

TWO SHOT

She swings about as he overtakes her, holding a

pair of scissors -- simply and transcendently

terrified. She strikes at him, slashing his

forearm. He and she stand in absolute silence. He

looks down at the stain of blood spreading through

the fabric of his jacket sleeve. Then he turns out

of the room and down the stairs.

EXT. BREE'S BROWNSTONE - DAY

Klute comes out of door -- goes down steps to his

own apartment. A passerby stops him for directions

and doesn't seem to notice the blood on his sleeve.

Klute goes into his apartment.

INT. BREE'S APARTMENT: BREE - DAY

Bree is in the middle of dialing the phone. Her

hands are shaking; she misdials -- holds down the

receiver for a moment then starts again.

INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: KLUTE - DAY

Klute stands in silence for a moment or two -- then

takes rather more note of his forearm. (Not

urgently but practically; it behooves him to stop

bleeding.) He turns toward the bathroom, pulling

his jacket off with the other hand.

INT. BREE'S APARTMENT: BREE - DAY

Bree speaks to the phone, trying to make a simple

point, trying to keep her voice even.

She hangs up before the other party can object in

detail -- takes up her purse and goes out, not even

closing the door behind her.

INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: BATHROOM: KLUTE - DAY

Klute has knotted a hand-towel around his forearm,

now uses teeth and fingers to pull the ends tight.

Then -- intending to clean up -- he takes up a

washcloth, reaches for the faucet --

EXT. BREE'S BROWNSTONE - DAY

Bree comes out of door - goes down steps -

hesitates in front of Klute's apartment struggling

with the question of whether to knock. CAMERA pulls

back to reveal we are watching her through the

windshield of a car in the parking lot across the

street. CAMERA pulls back further to reveal the

back of Cable's head as he sits in the car watching

her. Bree starts to knock on Klute's door but stops

herself and walks down the street. Cable's head

moves out of the shot. We hear the sound of the car

door opening and closing. Through the windshield we

see Cable cross in front of the car and start to

follow Bree down the street.

INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: BATHRO0M: KLUTE - DAY

Klute finishes mopping up. SOUND OF TELEPHONE. He

turns back out of the bathroom and answers it.

EXT. STREET: BREE - DAY

Bree is about a quarter block away from the

Brownstone now, hurrying. She waves in the

direction of a cab, misses it, continues on. We CUT

TO --

EXT. STREET: CABLE - DAY

Cable stands looking after her, hesitates over

choice of action, decides to follow.

EXT. STREET: FIGURES: PAST BREE TO CABLE - DAY

We establish the distance between them -- Cable 100

or so feet behind her, unnoticed by her,

maintaining about the same pace, not -- at this

point -- trying to overtake (perhaps waiting for

less populated surroundings) We CUT BACK TO --

INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: KLUTE - DAY

Klute continues his phone conversation, short

spoken.

He hangs up. First he checks out the windows (but -

if we want to be accurate - from mid room, without

directly approaching the windows themselves). Then

he secures a pistol from his jacket (and folds the

jacket itself over his arm to conceal it, as a

matter of public decorum), and goes on out.

INT. STAIRWELL: KLUTE - DAY

Klute's manner, over the next few minutes, exhibits

an absolute, untheatrical, care and competence. A

man -- Cable -- may in fact be hiding here

somewhere to kill him. He sets about checking the

likely places -- first of all the lower hallway,

then the stairwell itself, moving steadily

unalarmedly up.

At the top he notes -- but still without main

concern that Bree's door is open. He calls ahead --

INT. BREE'S APARTMENT: KLUTE - DAY

He enters, puzzles, starts checking around (quite

thoroughly; she might be hiding from him). We CUT

BACK TO --

EXT. STREETS: BREE; FIGURE OF CABLE - DAY

Bree moves past CONSTRUCTION WORK, through one of

those temporary pedestrian passageways. Behind her,

nearer than before we see the FIGURE OF CABLE.

INT. STAIRWELL - DAY

Klute comes quickly back downstairs, back into his

room, takes up the phone. Through the still-open

door we watch him begin dialing -- then CUT TO --

INT. SPANGLER'S (OUTER) OFFICE - DAY

Bree sits isolated on the waiting-room couch. She

may have been here for fifteen minutes -- or an

hour. She turns the pages of a magazine -- one

handed, without even lifting it from the coffee

table, with an absolute lack of interest, a

mechanical gesture.

We hear FOOTSTEPS approaching directly toward where

we are watching Bree sit.

WIDER - TWO SHOT

Bree looks up in a kind of frozen terror, as the

Secretary smiles nicely -- lovingly down at her.

Bree moves to the desk and telephone. But we move

with the Secretary as she moves into Spangler's

inner office and switches out the lights

(establishing TIME CHANGE: dusk now) and as we

hear, O.S., the sound of DIALING and BREE'S VOICE --

INT. GARMENT BUILDING: FABER'S OFFICE: FABER - DAY

(NIGHT)

Mr. Faber's phone buzzes; he picks it up.

INT. SPANGLER (OUTER) OFFICE: BREE ON PHONE - DAY

(NIGHT)

FABER, ON PHONE (OFFICE)

He hangs up. An ancient stirring, a kind of

triumph. He glances about, then tightens his tie.

Then it comes to him, after all -- he takes note of

himself -- he leans forward against his desk and

rubs his forehead with old bony fingers. We CUT TO

-

INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT - DAY (NIGHT)

KLUTE on phone.

He hangs up, immediately starts to dial again, then

pauses to check a list he's laid out by the

telephone. While he's doing this, his PHONE RINGS.

He is interrupted again -- Trask wasting no words

on his end of things -- nods once --

-- and depresses the receiver just long enough to

clear the connection, and starts dialing again --

We CUT TO --

INT. STAIRWAY OF GARMENT BUILDING - DAY (NIGHT)

Quitting time. As Bree enters from street level,

employees are coming down the stairs, pushing past

her. She continues up on until at one point -- one

more officious or more communicative than the

others informs her --

He lets her pass, glances after her like the

others, continues on his way.

INT. GARMENT BUILDING: FABER RECEPTION AREA - DAY

(NIGHT)

Bree arrives at the head of the stairs -- as still

others press past her on their way down -- and

comes more or less directly up against the thickset

RECEPTIONIST. She is packing her purse, preparing

to depart, looks somewhat challengingly at Bree --

who sees no way to avoid the issue.

Bree goes on nervously in the direction indicated,

toward --

A CORNER OF OFFICES: NATHAN FABER

NATHAN stands bending over a bench with back to

camera, conferring with another man as Bree

approaches -- looking to us, as to her, exactly

like his father. We hear the Receptionist's VOICE

repeating --

As Bree nears him, he straightens and turns -- a

much younger man. Bree stops short, recognizing the

error.

She has already started away. He calls after her

evenly --

She looks back quickly, smiles nervously --

But we hold on him for a moment as she continues

out of scene -- until he turns away to other

matters. Then --

RECEPTION AREA: RECEPTIONIST, BREE

Bree returns toward Receptionist, awkwardly --

The Receptionist riffles through a stack of

assorted envelopes -- hands one out to Bree -- and

promptly takes her way off. Out. Bree starts to

open the envelope then and there -- but OTHERS

continue to move past her. She seeks a more private

place.

ROWS OF GARMENTS

Bree shelters herself out of sight from everyone

else -- though we continue to hear INTERMITTENT

VOICES, O.S. and continue to maintain the sense of

other presences.

We see her open the envelope --

CLOSER: BREE, ENVELOPE

She finds nothing inside but money -- bills

totaling fifty dollars. We see her looking for a

message, finding nothing. It comes to her slowly

that she's been paid off and avoided. She bites her

lips in pain. She pushes back out of hiding --

RECEPTIONIST AREA

-- back to the reception area again. (By now this

immediate scene has emptied, though we catch sight

of a figure or two at scene-start, moving through

the background, and continue to hear an occasional

NOISE or VOICE O.S.)

Bree looks about for someone -- then scouts for a

pencil, finds one in a desk (or bench) drawer,

starts to readdress the envelope (to direct it back

to Mr. Faber). Then she breaks off from that, takes

up a PHONE instead, dials -- waits -- then --

She hangs up, goes back to readdressing the

envelope. FOOTSTEPS are approaching in her

direction. She glances up apologetically.

She pauses --

ANGLE PAST BREE TO CABLE

Cable hastens toward her along a lane of garments.

In this brief glimpse a ludicrous and terrifying

figure -- a noise, a gesticulation (actually the

gesture is arms out, palms downward, intended as a

quieting gesture; and the hissing noise is intended

as a shushing). Bree cries out, turns to run --

-- as we immediately, even as she's turning, CUT TO

--

INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT: KLUTE - DAY (NIGHT)

Klute speaks quietly but with terrible urgency into

the phone (dealing evidently with an ethically

skittish message service at the other end).

INT. GARMENT BUILDING - DAY (NIGHT)

Cable and Bree. They are at some remove from the

site of Cable's first appearance; there are other

evidences of time-lapse. Cable's manner is that of

slightly-strained patience -- a civility -- an

attempt now and then to smile. Bree watches his

every slight gesture, quivers to make a break for

it, tries throughout to buy time.

He looks at her discerningly. She seems not to have

followed his exposition. He tries patiently to

clarify it.

The PHONE RINGS, an explosive noise. Bree startles.

It has been put on night-ring, to sound all over

the loft, and the noise is deafening. But -- the

most bizarre element is Cable's absolute lack of

response to it. It rings and rings as he talks and

talks -- in the same expository tone as before,

without raising his voice. It drowns out most of

his words -- at most we catch only odd phrases of

all the following -- but he seems not to hear it

any more than the clamor of other things torturing

his soul.

He turns and lifts a phone (one of the extension

phones situated around the loft) -- though up to

now he's given no evidence of even hearing the

ringing. He just stands holding the phone for a

time, then lowers it back on the receiver. With a

sort of absolute quiet --

Pause. Then he shudders slightly.

We CUT TO --

EXT. STREETS - DAY (NIGHT)

We see Klute -- probably in MLS -- running along

street. He tries for a cab -- misses it -- halts

the next by expedient of cutting bodily in front of

it. The Driver starts to lean out to object. Klute

mashes him back inside, enters the cab. We CUT BACK

TO --

INT. GARMENT BUILDING - DAY (NIGHT)

MLS, the two FIGURES: CABLE, BREE. They are

somewhat separated -- Cable has gone to look down

from one of the arched windows of the loft, while

Bree remains in place. She is a prisoner, we can

suppose -- when we cut closer we'll see her eyes

continually shifting, her mind calculating her

chances -- but he hasn't molested her. He bears her

no animus at this point. His manner is rather

quiet, undetermined. He feels some relief that the

thing is, in effect, over -- and some puzzlement

about what to do (with either her or himself) now.

He returns toward her.

CLOSER: BREE, CABLE

Nearing her again, he gestures several times,

apologetically, seeking words.

He happens too close; she can't avoid shrinking.

He seems not to have heard the request. He sits for

a moment. An intellectual interest, a curiosity.

(Meanwhile, perhaps, we see her starting to slip

her shoes off, in hopes of running.)

He rises, approaches her -- apparently taken in,

credulous, grateful, wondering --

He hits her.

He hits her again.

INT. ELEVATOR - KLUTE ASCENDING - DAY (NIGHT)

EXT. GARMENT BUILDING ROOF (DIRECTLY ABOVE FABER

LOFT) - DAY (NIGHT)

Klute has gun out - as he carefully makes his way

across the roof. Man in hotel window across street

holding drink - watches him with amused curiosity.

Klute spots entrance to stairway.

INT. GARMENT BUILDING: KLUTE - DAY (NIGHT)

Klute goes downstairs to back entrance of Faber

loft. He slips inside. He hears THE SOUNDS OF THE

BEATING -- a stirring of feet and indistinct impact

sounds, a murmur of voices (but all quite muted,

undramatic). He maneuvers through lanes of

garments, trying to gain a line of sight. He

understands what's going on, strains to intervene,

but can't disclose himself. At a point, he drops to

hands and knees, slides underneath the garment

racks, drawing closer to Cable, trying to gain

position. We intersperse his progress with further

Bree-Cable fragments, as for instance --

FRAGMENT: CABLE, BREE

KLUTE, SHIFTING CLOSER

Klute works his way steadily closer -- under

steadily increasing pressure, as the pursuit and

beating continue as SOUNDS, O.S. Even close at hand

the noises are ambiguous -- the clatter of

footsteps, grunts, a slap of flesh -- rather than

distinct. Once or twice we hear CABLE'S VOICE

clearly enough to make out words --

-- and once or twice a CRY from Bree.

Klute tries to gain aim --

P.O.V. TO BREE, CABLE

-- but Cable is too close upon her, and they are

too steadily in motion.

KLUTE

Klute moves on -- moves on -- gains position --

springs.

CABLE

Cable catches the sound, whirls, screams --

P.O.V. TO KLUTE

Klute closes with him, knocks loose Cable's pistol

- contends for it again, knocks it loose again.

EFFECT -- under -- SIRENS.

CABLE, KLUTE

Cable breaks loose, backs a step -- backs another

step -- and then, turns and runs unhesitant against

one of the windows, exploding it outward with him,

both frame and glass.

EXT. WIDE SHOT: BUILDINGS - DAY (NIGHT)

We see the body tracing its quick path down the

dark side of the building.

EXT. DOWNSHOT FROM LOFT TO STREET (KLUTE'S P.O.V.) -

DAY (NIGHT)

EXT. BASE OF BUILDING: CABLE'S BODY - DAY (NIGHT)

The sound of SIRENS a little LOUDER.

INT. GARMENT BUILDING: KLUTE, BREE - DAY (NIGHT)

Klute turns from looking down, moves to where Bree

kneels on the floor. He hunkers down.

In a gentle-enough VOICE, but matter-of-factly

withal -- as if to a child --

(Note: also shoot in MSL, without dialogue, with

SIRENS O.S. full up.) Then we CUT TO --

INT. KLUTE'S APARTMENT - DAY

KLUTE is packing to leave. We follow him about as

he carries clothing from closet and bureau, folds

it into his suitcase on the table. We hear the

familiar FOOTSTEPS on the stairs. Bree's KNOCK. He

lets her in, keeps on about his business. His

expression is sober; hers is quite tentative.

He doesn't at least expel her. She ventures in,

sits on the table, swings her heels, watches him

pack. His arm impairs him. At length --

Pause. She compresses her lips, slips down from the

table, starts smartly out of the room.

She returns and sits on the table again, waits. But

Klute doesn't seem about to say anything more --

goes on packing.

He complies, stands and looks, folding a necktie.

But now she finds she has to look away. Somewhat

brokenly --

He resumes packing, continues through the

following.

Thereafter he guards his silence, staunchly goes on

packing, as she comes at the thing from various

sharp angles.

He has almost finished packing -- returns toward

the suitcase with the tin CLOCK and electric FAN,

tries to fit them in as conversation continues.

He sets the fan beside her, hands her the LOUDLY

TICKING clock. She holds it in her lap, numbly.

He's packed -- closes various drawers, leaving in

good order -- snaps the suitcase shut, lifts it

stiffly down from the table. She remains sitting.

He moves to the door, pauses, half-smiles --

She smiles back. He goes. We hear the entryway door

opening and closing.

She slips down off the table. We CUT TO --

EXT STREET OUTSIDE BROWNSTONE - DAY

Klute is, let's say, about seventy feet on his way

when she appears at the front door, calls after

him.

He turns around and stops. He walks slowly back to

her.

CLOSER: BREE, KLUTE

He arrives in proximity to her. Then the following

events in more or less the following order:

He looks at her inquiringly. She responds by

sitting down, plunk, on the grubby front step of

the Brownstone.

Having stood for some time -- during which she has

offered only twitching motions of her hands -- he

sets down the suitcase.

Having set down the suitcase, but derived no

answer, he reaches out one arm, and leans against

the building front.

She nearly arrives at the level of statement.

Fretfully, indecisively --

Then, as a man not to be dallied with, he picks up

the suitcase again. She looks at him strickenly,

but it doesn't precipitate her into speech.

He puts it down again.

And then -- then, after all, goddamit, he reaches

out, grabs her wrist, and simply hauls her along,

suitcase in one hand, Bree in the other. As she

yanks, shouts, struggles --
