Edith whispers to Richie.

Carmine turns and starts to walk out of the room.

Carmine leaves the room.

Irving looks over and shrugs his shoulders. Not surprised at

all the way this is going and horrified that Richie has

ruined it.

Irving stands up angry and gets in Richie's face.

Irving storms out of the hotel suite towards the Elevators to

get Carmine.

Awkward pause.

CUT TO: PORTABLE RECORD PLAYER PLAYS START OF JEEP'S BLUES as

Irving and Sydney nod to it - he watches her foot in her high

They listen to the record, Edith checks Irving out.

Sydney starts riffling through nice things hanging on the

racks.

Sydney looks back at Irving in shock.

She continues walking out without looking back and leaves.

The door slams in Irving's face

INT. IRV'S DINGY OFFICE - DAY

IRVING PACES AROUND THE OFFICE UPSET AT HIMSELF. SLOWLY SITS

DOWN IN THE DESK CHAIR IN DEFEAT, TAKES OFF HIS GLASSES AND

SITS BACK.

OFF SCREEN THE DOOR OPENS. SHE WALKS RIGHT UP TO IRVING AS HE

SITS AT HIS DESK. SHE TOSSES HER COAT TO THE SIDE.

IRVING STARES UP HER TENSE -- WHAT WILL SHE DO?

Irving looks stunned as he slowly clasps her extended hand.

CONTINUOUS MONTAGE AS THEIR CLOTHING CHANGES FROM DAY TO DAY

BUT THE SETTING REMAINS THE SAME AS THEY CON MARK AFTER MARK.

A desperate man takes out a BUSINESS CHECK BOOK and writes

his check.

INT. IRV'S DINGY OFFICE - ANOTHER DAY

Sydney and Irving laugh and celebrate.

INT. IRV'S GLASS STORE - DAY

Sydney -- hair getting bigger -- goes over the books with a

Oh shut up --

I save a young single mother, and

her kid. I marry her. I adopt him -

-

You fell in love! Don't forget we

fell madly in love!

Yes, I fell in love. My God, I

fell in love. Yes. But you know

what? I thought you were

mysterious like my mother until it

turned out that mysterious just

meant depressed, hard to reach. I

mean, I'm dying here! And you need

somebody who's gonna be quiet like

you. You're young, you're

beautiful. You gotta find somebody

else. You gotta go out and get

some friends all right? Don't sit

inside --

I don't like going out. You know

that I get anxiety when I have to

meet people. You know how hard that

is.

Yeah but you can't just stay in the

house with the fucking sun lamp.

Alright? And I can't-- I mean,

look, I can't trust you with it

anyway. That fire and everything. I

can't trust to leave you with

Danny.

I put the fire out Irving! There is

no fire! Maybe if you were here

more, then there wouldn't have been

a fire in the first place.

Oh, what, there wouldn't have been

a fire if I was here?

Rosalyn just stares there for a moment at Irving saying

nothing.

Rosalyn sheds her muumuu, to reveal a white leotard.

63             Baby, there's such good stuff here.                    63

Edith stares at him and smiles.

Irving decides to interject.

Irv stares at her and struggles.

Sydney goes storming out of the room and down the hall of her

apartment. Irving follows.

She starts sobbing, shaking.

Irv walks to her and bends down to join her on the floor as

she sobs.

Sydney reaches over and carefully grabs Irving's face

lovingly which quickly turns into a slap as she continues on.

Irving stares at Sydney with confusion. He's never seen her

like this before.

Sydney gets up from the couch and storms back to her room.

Richie jumps into the conversation.

He walks over to Carl.

Irv stares at Richie with contempt, then turns to Edith,

DRESSED TO THE NINES.

"WOW".

Irving interjects.

You want to tell him, Edith? You

want to wake him up?

Oh no, I said we shouldn't do any

of it, Irving. You know I said

that. So now I support Richie.

He's got vision. Do it heavy or

don't do it.

I mean, he's the one ruining

America, not me.

How the hell am I ruining America?

Because people just got over

Watergate and Vietnam, alright?

And you're gonna shit all over

politicians again? And just because

you want to be a big shot and get a

promotion.

No I'm thinking big. This is gonna

be fantastic. We're doing video

surveillance. I'm doing this from

the feet up.

You will never do it properly

because you got too much government

attitude to be small and sleek.

I'm like the fuckin' Vietcong, man.

I'm in and I'm out. I was there the

whole time -- you don't know it.

That's the fucking art of becoming

somebody who people can pin their

beliefs and their dreams on. And

you can't do it.

How about a suite at the Sheraton

Hotel?

For Carmine Polito and rebuilding

Atlantic City?

Why not?

Edith listens intently.

Irv studies Richie and Edith.

IRVING AND RICHIE LOOK AT SYDNEY, UNCERTAIN.

IRVING SHAKES HIS HEAD IN DISGUST AND LEAVES. RICHIE STARES

AT SYDNEY SWINGING HER LEGS ON THE COUNTER AS SHE SITS.

Richie stands very close to Edith - between her legs as she

sits on the counter. He puts his hands on her hips, pulls

her into him. He takes her hand -- puts it on his face,

makes her feel his cheek and forehead with her hand. It is

intense. She prepares for him to kiss her but he steps back.

They are both excited. They stare at each other. The air is

thick with tension, Richie exhales and leaves.

He doesn't like you, what do you

want from me, I got him to come

back and take the money and you got

him on tape alright? I can't make

him like you. I did my job.

Did you tell him you were working

with me? That I'm the Sheik's

associate?!

I just fucking told you he doesn't

like you. I mean, let him have a

night out with a human being for

fuck's sake, he's going to jail

soon. You're done with him. You got

him on tape taking a bribe.

Carmine has got to deal with me,

Irving.

We're gonna use Carmine. We're

gonna use Carmine to get other

people, that's what we're gonna do.

What?! Like who?!

Carmine's gonna use the Sheik to

pay off people.

Are you fuckin' nuts? What are you

say--

We're gonna let Carmine show the

Sheik Atlantic City, how he's gonna

renovate hotels, and see who shows

up. Whoever the Sheik pays off for

licenses and casinos, that's who

we're gonna go after. We're gonna

go after all of 'em!

More politicians? You realize how

fuckin' dangerous that is? There's

no fucking reasoning with you.

It's Edith.

Sit down and pray properly!

Are you alright?

Yeah, I'm fine, I'm just alone, you

know? Irving's out with Carmine.

That's right, he went out with

Carmine and his wife. You must not

feel so good about that.

Richard, sit down!

Wait who's there? Who are you with?

Oh, no, it's just people.

People? I'm your fiancee! Richard!

Oh, you've got a fiancee. You're

engaged.

Well, I don't know, no fiancee.    I

don't know.

You don't know if you have a

fiancee?

I don't know --

You don't know? You don't know if

you have a fiancee?

Dolly laughs.

She puts it under Irv's nose as he talks to Carmine, he

sniffs, closes his eyes, nods without even looking.

She leans across the table and puts them under Carmine's

nose.

Carmine and Dolly rush to grab Rosalyn; JULIUS, Carmine's

steadfast AIDE, BLACK, 40, BIG SIDEBURNS, LOOSENED TIE and

white shirtsleeves, BIG SMILE, helps.

She WOBBLES INTO ARMS OF his WIFE Dolly, she and Carmine help

INT. PRIVATE JET - CONTINUOUS

Irv and Richie step aboard to find FBI AGENT PACO HERNANDEZ

putting on a regal looking white Arab keffyeh headdress and

robe -- he looks noble. TWO AGENTS posing as body guards.

Irv nods to Paco and the other agents.

Irving isn't sure, looks Paco up and down.

Irving takes a expensive looking ceremonial knife out of his

jacket pocket and holds it out to Paco.

Irving stares incredulously.

But she was on it. She heard.

He HANGS UP and walks into the kitchen. Rosalyn looks at him.

Irving opens the fridge which is a mess.

PHONE RINGS AGAIN.

She hands the phone to a very exasperated, anxious, Irv.

Dolly is getting dressed for the party in the background.

Irv hangs up and exits the kitchen.

Edith looks on, calm, as Richie -- WILD EYED WITH COCAINE AND

ADRENALINE --

Richie stares down Irv, Edith pulls Richie back -- Rosalyn is

starting to go down a SPIRAL OF DEPRESSION as she looks

increasingly uncomfortable.

She glares at Edith and Irv and pivots to walk to the bar.

But she's already on her way over to the MAFIA MEN at the bar

who GREET HER WARMLY as Irv, Edith, Richie, and Carmine

watch.

Rosalyn walks up to PETE MUSANE, CHARISMATIC, 30 and sits

down in between all the Mafia guys.. THE OTHER THREE SALT AND

PEPPER MAFIA GUYS LAUGH AND TALK WITH Rosalyn - who gulps a

glass of PROSECCO and IS REFILLED BY PETE MUSANE.

Carmine whispers to Irv as he watches Rosalyn talk to the

Mafia guys.

She knocks back the prosecco. She seems relieved.

Dolly ushers her kids to the door.

Irving and Edith watch in horror at Rosalyn.

Rosalyn's smitten by the mobsters.

He touches the front of her huge Farrah overhang bangs.

Richie, Irving, Carmine, and the Sheik walk up to them.

Irving takes the glass of prosecco out of Rosalyn's hand and

puts it on table.

Irving stares fuming at Rosalyn and the guys, he nods and

forces a smile good naturedly as they put prosecco glass in

his hand. He knows how to fake it.

THE MADE GUYS LAUGH. SYD ROLLS HER EYES. IRVING, CARMINE

STARE WITH TENSION.

THEY ALL LAUGH. RICHIE GUIDES SHEIK with ONE BODY GUARD.

The Sheik acknowledges them with a nod. Irv is extremely

uncomfortable.

HEAVY PAUSE.

Rosalyn reaches to have her glass refilled by Dick Helsing

when one of the other guys NUDGES her hip in her tight dress

and she drops into Pete Musane's lap.

Busboys whip open a white table cloth for the table.

Everyone sits down. Tellegio looks at the Sheik, then over to

Richie.

Richie pretends to translate in the Sheik's ear.

Irving and Richie both look at Victor intensely not sure

where this is going.

Richie and Tellegio both laugh.

Everyone stares increasingly tense at Tellegio in silence.

This could go wrong at any minute. Tellegio looks over to

Richie and points to the Sheik.

Irving watches in horror as --

PUSH IN ON IRV AND CARMINE FEELING THIS IMMENSE PRESSURE.

WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON HERE?

Irving looks ill, as does everyone else at the table.

Sheik swallows hard and looks to Richie. It's a very tense

moment for everyone at the table.

Tellegio stares. Everyone hangs on this. Irving and Richie

share a look -- what is he doing?

A DRUNK, AL KOWALSKI, a working man, friend of the Mayor

BARRELS INTO INTO THE TABLE, spilling drinks. Tellegio's guys

jump in and grab him and start to pull him away.

TELLEGIO GLARES BACK AT THE INTRUSION.

TELLEGIO DOES NOT LOOK AMUSED.

Paco Hernandez/Sheik stands up and reaches over to Tellegio

to shake his hand. Irving panics. THE MENACING DEEP BASS

INTRO OF "WHITE RABBIT" FADES UP ON THE SOUNDTRACK.

Irving exhales in relief that Paco managed to say anything

passable in Arabic.

Victor leans over to talk to Carmine.

Carmine nods.

Richie SLAMS DOWN THE PHONE. Edith (HAIR IN CURLERS) STARES

AT HIM.

He handles her hips and neck and waist and ass.

She grabs him by the head to calm him down.

HE TRIES A GENTLER SEDUCTION.

He handles her, nuzzles her neck, starts to turn her on.

SOMETHING CLICKS INSIDE HER -- SHE DROPS HER BRITISH ACCENT --

Richie steps back quickly and grabs Sydney.

Richie looks at her and continues to hold her looking very

confused and flustered.

Richie steps back. He stares at her darkly.

HE EMBRACES HER --

RED FACED LIKE HE MAY HIT HER, a vein stands out in his neck.

SHE FLINCHES. HE SCREAMS like an animal in confusion and

frustration.

SUDDENLY SYDNEY GRABS A GLASS PICTURE FRAME FROM A TABLE,

SMASHES IT ACROSS RICHIE'S FOREHEAD AND FACE WITH A

SHATTERING OF GLASS.

Richie in pain holds his cut forehead and eyebrow.

They hear a door open off screen, someone approaches. Irving

appears from around the corner of the wall pointing his

handgun at Richie.

Irving looks over to Sydney very confused.

Irving and Sydney stare.

He points the gun at Stoddard.

Richie and Stoddard stare at each other in silence.

Stoddard throws his head back, looks at ceiling in

exasperation.

OH GOD.

thought you were --

This is where they intersect! This

is where the two things intersect.

The Politicians and the Mafia.

Victor Tellegio's people who run

resorts international --

Victor Tellegio showed his face?

Yes. I sat with him. I sat with

Victor Tellegio. I hung out with

him. We can get him. We can get his

whole organization as well as

getting any number of congressmen.

I mean, that's just peeling the

first layer of the onion.

Wow. How you going to do that?

We would get ten million dollars

and put it into an account --

TEN MILLION DOLLARS?! Ten Million

dollars?

And that's how we just let them

know we're for real.

What does he say he's gonna do for

the ten million dollars? How are we

trapping him?

He promises to build casinos,

handle the skims, do the licencing -

Richie staring, mesmerized by this trap.

book.

Irving incredulous, thinks to himself how to respond. Forces

himself to say gently --

Irv is doing everything he can to hold it together.

Rosalyn gets up from the bed and walks over to Irving.

As he listens to words he has been saying himself for months,

now spoken as Rosalyn's idea.

Simone sits behind his desk, the silent secretary sits just

behind him slightly to the side, stares at Edith, Richie,

Irving.

Simone slides a small pink piece of paper across the desk to

them. Richie stares at the paper, but doesn't touch it.

Richie motions with his hand to Edith that he agrees with

Irving.

He stands, goes to the door.
