FROM THE BLACK WE HEAR--

Did you know there are more people with

genius IQ's living in China than there

are people of any kind living in the

United States?

That can't be true.

it is true.

What would account for that?

Well first of all, a lot of people live

in China. But here's my question:

INT. CAMPUS BAR - NIGHT

MARK ZUCKERBERG is a sweet looking 19 year old whose lack of

any physically intimidating attributes masks a very

complicated and dangerous anger. He has trouble making eye

contact- and sometimes it's hard to tell if he's talking to you

or to himself.

ERICA, also 19, is Mark's date. She has a girl-next-door face

that makes her easy to fall for. At this point in the

conversation she already knows that she'd rather not be there

and her politeness is about to be tested.

The scene is stark and simple.

How do you distinguish yourself in a

population of people who all got 1600 on

their SAT's?

I didn't know they take SAT's in China.

I wasn't talking about China anymore, I

was talking about here.

You got 1600?

You can sing in an a Capella group.

2.

Does that mean that you actually got

nothing wrong?

Or you row crew or you invent a 25 dollar

PC.

Or you get into a final club.

Or you get into a final club, exactly.

I like guys who row crew.

Well I can't do that. And yes, it means I

got nothing wrong on the test.

Have you ever tried?

I'm trying now.

To row crew?

To get into a final club. To row crew?

No. Are you, like--whatever--crazy?

Sometimes, Mark-seriously-YOU say two

things at once and I'm not sure which one

we're talking about.

But you've seen guys who row crew, right?

No.

Okay, well.. they're bigger than me.

They're world class athletes. And a

second ago you said you like guys who row

crew so I assumed you'd met one.

I guess I meant I liked the idea of it.

The way a girl likes cowboys.

3.

The Phoenix is good.

This is a new topic?

It's the same topic.

We're still talking about the finals

clubs?

Would you rather talk about something

else?

It's just that since the beginning of

the conversation about finals clubs I

think I may have had a birthday.

We can change the subject.

ERICA.

(can't get over it)

There are more people in China with genius

IQ's than the entire population of--

It's about exclusivity.

.....what is?

The final clubs. And that's how you

distinguish yourself. The Phoenix is the

most diverse. The Fly Club, Roosevelt

punched the Porc.

Which one?

The Porcellian, the Porc, it's the best

of the best.

I actually meant which Roosevelt.

Theodore.

4.

Okay, well, which is the easiest one to

get into?

MARK takes a cigarette from a pack, lights it, takes a drag

and blows the smoke out before he says...

Hm.

What?

why would you ask me that?

I was just asking.

They're all hard to get into. My friend

Eduardo made $300,000 betting on oil

futures last summer and he won't get in.

Money or the ability to make it doesn't

impress anybody around here. Everybody

can do that.

He made $300,000 in a summer?

He likes meteorology.

You said it was oil futures.

If you can predict the weather you can

predict the price of heating oil. You

asked me that because you think the final

club that's easiest to get into is the

one where I'll have the best chance,

I've lost my place again.

You asked me which one was the easiest to

get into because you think that's where I

have the best chance.

The one that's easiest to get into would

be the one where anybody had the best

chance.

S.

I just think you asked--the placement of

where you asked the question--

I was honestly just asking. Okay? I was

asking just to ask. Mark, I'm not

speaking in code.

Erica--

You're obsessed with the finals clubs.

You have finals clubs OCD and you need to

see someone about this who'll prescribe

some sort of medication. You don't care

if side effects may include blindness,

okay, just do it.

Final clubs. Not finals clubs and there's

a difference between being obsessed and

being motivated.

Yes there is.

Well you do--that was cryptic--so you do

speak in code.

I didn't mean to be cryptic.

I'm saving I need to do something

substantial in order to get the attention

of the clubs.

Why?

Because they're exclusive.

And fun and they lead to a better life.

You think Teddy Roosevelt got elected

president because he was a member of the

Phoenix Club?

He was a member of the Porcellian and yes

I do.

6.

Maybe he sang in an a Capella group.

I want to be straight forward and tell

you that I think you should be a lot more

supportive. If I get in I'll be taking

you to the parties and you'll be meeting

people that you wouldn't normally get to

meet.

You would do that for me?

You're my girlfriend.

okay, well I want to be straight forward

and tell you that I'm not anymore.

What do you mean?

I'm not your girlfriend anymore,

Is this a joke?

No, I'm sorry, it's not.

You're breaking up with me?

You're going to introduce me to people I

wouldn't normally get to meet? What the

fuck is that supposed to mean?

Take it easy.

What was it supposed to mean?

It was--Erica, the reason we're able to

sit here and drink is that you used to

sleep with the door guy.

I want to really try not to lose it now.

7.

The door guy's name is Bobby. I haven't

slept with the door guy, the door guy's a

friend of mine. He's a perfectly good

class of people and what part of Long

Island are you from--England?

I'm from Westchester.

I'm going back to my dorm.

Wait, wait, thisi reel?

Yes.

I apologize, okay? Siddown.

I'm going back to my dorm, I have to

study.

Yeah.

I'm sorry and I mean it..

I appreciate that but--

Come on.

---I have to study.

You don't have to study. Let's just talk.

I can't..

Why?

Because it's exhausting. Going out with

you is like dating a stairmaster.

S.

All I meant is that you go to B.U. and so

you're not likely to--I wasn't making a

comment on your parents--I was saying you

go to B.U.

I have to go study.

You don't have to study.

How do you know I don't have to study?!

Because you go to B.U.!

ERICA stares at him...

Do you want to get some food?

I'm sorry you're not sufficiently

impressed with my education.

And I'm sorry T don't have a rowboat.

I think we should just be friends.

I don't need friends.

I was being polite, I had no intention

being friends with you.

You're really leaving.

ERICA takes MARK's hand and looks at him tenderly..

Listen, You're going to be successful and

rich. But you're going to go through life

thinking that girls don't like you

because you're a tech geek. And I want

you to know, from the bottom of my heart,

that that won't be true. It'll be because

you're an asshole.

9.

And with that stinger, ERICA walks off and we stay on MARK as

the pulsing intro to Paul Young's "Love of the Common People"

(calling over her shoulder)

And you're never getting into a final

club.

Along with the MUSIC, we slowly push in on MARK. A fuse has

just been lit.

EXT. BAR - NIGHT

As MARK busts out of the bar, past Bobby the door guy and into

the population of Harvard Square.

EXT. HARVARD SQUARE - NIGHT

As MARK continues on, he passes a group of people heading in

the opposite direction for a party.

As MARK's steady and determined stride continues, he'll. pass

by all kinds of (seemingly) happy, well-adjusted, socially

adept people.

The vocals from the Paul Young song come in--

LIVING ON FREE FOOD TICKETS

WATER IN THE MILK FROM A HOLE IN THE ROOF

WHAT CAN YOU DO?

TEARS FROM YOUR LITTLE SISTER

CRYING 'CAUSE SHE DOESN'T HAVE A DRESS

WITHOUT A PATCH FOR THE PARTY TO GO

BUT YOU KNOW SHE'LL GET BY

INT. KIRKLAND HOUSE/LOBBY - NIGHT

As the MUSIC CONTINUES and MARK busts into the lobby of his

dorm. He doesn't look at anyone as he heads up the stairs and

INT. MARK'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT

A bedroom that's part of a three-bedroom suite. The MUSIC

CONTINUES as MARK walks in, flicks his lap-top on without

looking at it and walks out of frame as we stay on the laptop.

'CAUSE SHE'S LIVING IN THE LOVE OF THE

SMILES FROM THE HEART OF A FAMILY MAN

DADDY'S GONNA BUY YOU A DREAM TO CLING TO

MAMA'S GONNA LOVE YOU JUST AS MUCH AS SHE

AND SHE CAN

Then a moment or two later, a glass with ice gets set down

next to the lap-top. Then a carton of orange juice followed by

a bottle of vodka.

MARK's fingers dance easily on the keyboard---like a Juilliard

pianist warming up.

In the exact time it takes him to pour the vodka and orange

juice over ice, the website he's just called up gets loaded

onto the screen.

Zuckonit.com

This is the only place he's comfortable.

He begins blogging.

MARY, (V.0.)

Erica Albright'as a bitch. You think

that's because her family changed their

name from Albrecht or do you think it's

because all B.U, girls are bitches?

He takes a good gulp of his drink. We see the words we're

hearing filling up his computer screen--

MARK (V,O.) (CONT'D)

Folks, for the record, she may look like

a 34D but she's getting all kinds of help

from our friends at Victoria's Secret,

She's a 348, as in barely anything there..

False advertising.

11.

INT. MARX'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT

Fresh ice gets dropped in the glass and a new drink poured.

"Love of the Common People" continues.

in back of MARK, sitting on the bed and hitting a bong, is

BILLY. OLSEN.

MARK (V.O.)

The truth is she has a nice face. I need

to think of something to help me take my

mind off her. Easy enough, except I need

an idea.

MARK has moved his mouse to an icon on his desktop labeled

"Kirkland Facebook". He clicks and opens it. A menu of photos

appear. He blogs again.

MARK (V.0.) (CONT'D)

I'm a little intoxicated, I'm not gonna

lie. So what if it's not even 10PM and

it's a Tuesday night? The Kirkland

Facebook is open on my desktop and some

of these people have pretty horrendous

f acebook-pics. Billy Olson's sitting here

and had the idea of putting some of these

girls' faces next to pictures of farm

animals and have people vote on who's

hotter. .

INT. FINAL CLUB - NIGHT

We'll be cutting back here a lot in this sequence, with the

Paul Young song tying them together, as we show---mostly MOS---

preparations under way for the hottest party on campus

tonight.

We start on a good looking STUDENT fixing his tie in the

bathroom mirror. He walks out of the bathroom and into the

main area where he's immediately tossed a bottle of champagne

by a similarly dressed STUDENT. We see that there are a

couple of dozen other guys around. Our guy takes the champagne

bottle and sticks it on the bar, which is being stocked by two

sexy FEMALE uniformed BARTENDERS.

Our guy walks past P. DJ's table where the DJ is setting up his

incredibly high-end equipment.

Our guy trots down a set of mahogany and red-carpet stairs,

opens a heavy door and looks out to the sidewalk.

12,

A BOUNCER in a tuxedo is standing by a velvet rope which is

holding back three dozen STUDENTS. The students are mostly

women and the women are all dressed to catch a man.

Over all this, we HEAR MARK CONTINUINGa

MARK (V.0.)

Good call, Mr. Olson! I think he's on to

something.

MARK (V.0.) (CONT'D)

year it's on. I'm not gonna do the farm

animals but I like the idea of comparing

two people together. It gives the whole

thing a very Turing feel since people's

ratings of the pictures will be more

implicit than, say, choosing a number to

represent each person's hotness like they

do on hotornot.com. The first thing we're

going to need is a lot of pictures.

Unfortunately, Harvard doesn't keep a

public centralized facebook so I'm going

to have to get all the images from the

individual houses that people are in. Let

the hacking begin.

CUT. TO:

INT. MARK'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT

There are two more kids-in the room with MARK--DUSTIN

MOSKOWITZ and CHRIS.-BUGHES.

MARK (V.0.)

First u is Kirkland. They keep

everything open and allow indexes in

their Apache configuration, so a little

NGET magic is all that's necessary to

download the entire Kirkland facebook.

Kids' stuff.

On the computer screen, we've been seeing him download picture

after picture of Harvard girls.

They're led. in to a party in full swing. The best and the

brightest are checking out the hottest and the easiest.

INT. MARK'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT

MARK finishes another drink and gets back to his work.

MARK (V.0.)

Next is Elliot. They're also open but

with no indexes on Apache. I can run an

empty search and it returns all of the

images in the database in a single page.

Then I can save the page and Mozilla will

save all the images for me. Excellent.

Moving right along.

Flying by at super-speed on MARR's computer screen have been

commands and images that the rest of us can't possibly

understand.

INT. FINAL CLUB - NIGHT

GIRLS are dancing with each other, doing tequila shots with

guys and laughing at jokes.

Perfect timing. Eduardo's here and he's

Give each.girl a.-base rating of 1400. At

any time `Girl All has a rating R-a and

"Girl B" has a rating R-b.

When any two girls are matched up there'

an expectation of which will win based on

It works.

Who should we send it to first?

The party's in its drunken stage.

We move to a room where there's a co-ed poker game underway

with the girls smoking cigars, Ai12bra and a couple of pairs of

No you don't want to read it.

ERICA ignores her roommate, We see her mortification as she

one of them wearing a padded bra over his Boston University

sweatshirt.

A tired GRAD STUDENT who spends the night monitoring the

INT. DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY

It's three years later and MARK is sitting with his LAWYERS at

a large conference table.

23.

MARK is wearing a hoodie, sweatpants and Adidas flip-flops--a

personal uniform that we'll come to understand. And while it

may take us a while to notice it, MARK's a different person in

these flash-forward scenes. Still tortured and complicated,

but comfortable now with his own power.

His lawyer is SY, who's accompanied by some junior associates,

one of whom--a pleasant, pretty and professional young

contemporary of Mark's named MARYLIN, we'll get to know.

a. a mpanied by some associates. A STENOGRAPHER is typing the

recor..

The room is glass on two sides and through the windows we can

see the behemoths of Silicon valley--Oracle, SunMicrosystems,

Google, etc.

GRETCHEN is taking MARK's deposition.

So you were called in front of the Ad

Board.

That's not what happened.

You weren't called in front of the

Administrative Board?

No, back, I mean--That's--back at the bar

with Erica Albright. She said all that?

That I said that stuff to her?

i was reading from the transcript of her

why would you even need to depose her?

That's really for us to--

You think if I know she can make me look

like a. jerk I'll be more likely--

--to settle, right?

24,

Why don't we stretch our legs a minute,

can we do that? It's been almost three

hours and frankly you did spend an awful

lot of time embarrassing Mr. Zuckerberg

with the girl's testimony in the bar.

I'm not embarrassed, it's just that she

made a lot of that up.

She was under oath.

Then I guess that would be the first time

somebody's lied under oath.

People are stretching and getting coffee and talking quietly.

MARK stays in his seat.

MARYLIN, the attractive second year associate who's on Mark's

legal team is still sitting too... about four seats down from

Mark.

Eight percent of the male population of

Harvard had been on it within two hours?

Eighty.

What?

Eighty percent of the male population.

Wow.

EXT. CHARLES RIVER - DAWN

The Harvard Crew is practicing on two-man sculls. There are

three boats that are running roughly even with each other and

the two-man crews are rowing with all they've got. We're

gliding along with them in the water--

Bring up the rate! 2 in 2! One..two--

25,

Power 10 in 2! In 2!

They had open water after a hundred

meters. I don't think we're gonna catch

'em today.

already five boat, ngths ahead of the other three.

The fourth boat is being crewed by CAMERON and TYLER

WINKLEVOSS----identical twins who stepped out of an ad for

Abercrombie and Fitch.

They know that the others aren't in their class and even

though they're highly competitive athletes, they don't like

showing anyone up, least of all their teammates.

Is there anyway to make this a fair

fight?

We could jump out and swim.

I think we'd have to jump out and drown.

I'm not willing to do that.

What are we at three-quarter power? Let's

drop down to a half.

Or you could row forward and I could row

backward.

I'd kick your ass.

We're genetically identical, so biology

and mathematics says we'd stay in one

place not allowing for the current or the

wind.

Just row the boat.

26,

And the WINI{LEVOSS twins kick into full gear and open up an

even wider lead as we.

CUT. TO:

INT. DINING HALL - MORNING

Two stacks of The Crimson, Harvard's student newspaper, get

dropped on the floor as TYLER and CAMERON walk by--their trays

loaded with mountains of eggs and pancakes and carbs.

Everyone knows and loves them in this 200 year old dining hall

and they wave and shout to a few people and whisper to a

couple of very pretty girls before taking a seat next to DIVYA

NARENDRA, a nice looking Indian student whose face is in a

copy of the Crimson.

What's up?

You guys hear about this?

What?

Two nights ago a sophomore at Kirkland

crashed the computers.

Which computers?

All of them. Be crashed the whole system.

TYLER picks up a copy-of the Crimson and begins reading while

his brother and DIVYA keep talking.

How?

He set up a website where you vote on the

hotness of female Harvard undergrads.

What were we doing that none of us heard

about this?

I don't know. Rowing, going to class,

studying? How much activity was there on

this thing that he crashed the--

22,000 votes. There were 22,000 hits,

27.

Cam, this guy hacked into the facebooks

of seven houses in two hours. He set up

the whole site in one night while he was

drunk.

22,000 hits?

Yeah.

He was blogging simultaneously. Divya?

I'm way ahead of you.

This is our guy.

INT. SECOND DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY

It's MARX and his LAWYERS again but this time on the other

side of the table are TYLER and CAMERON, DLVYA and the.i.r

lawyer, GAGE, whose family had first-class seats on the

Mayflower.

INT. ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING ROOM - DAY

MARK stands before a panel of ADMINISTRATORS as well as COX,

the systems manager who was woken up in the opening sequence.

Mr. Zuckerberg, this is an Administrative

Board hearing.

28,

You're being accused of intentionally

breaching security, violating copyrights

and violating individual privacy by

creating the website, WWW.FACEMASH.COM.

You're also charged with being in

violation of the university's policy on

distribution of digitized images. Before

we begin with our questioning you're

allowed to make a statement. Would you

like to do so?

Uh...I've, you know, I've apologized in

the Crimson to the ABHW, to Fuerza Latina

and to any women at Harvard who might

have been insulted as I take it they were

by the things that have been said tome

in the last week. As for any charges

stemming from the breach of security, I

believe I deserve some sort of

recognition from this Ad Board.

I'm sorry?

Yes.

I don't understand.

Which part?

You believe you deserve recognition?

I pointed-out some pretty gaping holes in

your system.

Excuse me, may I?

Yes.

Mr. Zuckerberg, I'm in charge of security

for all computers on the Harvard system.

I can assure you of its sophistication

and in fact it was that level of

sophistication that led us to you in less

four hours.

29.

Four hours?

Yes sir.

That would be impressive except the

algorithm I used was written on my dorm

room window. Keep up the great work.

INT. CORRIDOR -- DAY

As the heavy wooden door from the hearing slams shut behind

MARK. EDUARDO is waiting for him.

Well?

Six months academic probation.

They walk out onto--

EXT. QUAD - CONTINUOUS

EDU.ARDO

It could have been worse.

No it couldn't. They made me apologize.

To who?

To them. Over and over.

It's alright.

No.

It's okay. You're fine.

I shouldn't have said the thing about the

farm animals. That was stupid. Everybody's

mad at me now.

30,

Maybe, but at least everybody knows you

now.

INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY

MARX is in his Operating Systems class. This is considered the

hardest class at Harvard and MARK is one of the 50 students

with their laptops open as the professor takes them through an

impossibly difficult lesson,

So let's look at a sample problem:

Suppose we're given a computer with a 16-

bit virtual address and a page size of

256 bytes.

A GIRL scribbles something on a piece of paper. Then hands it

to the student next to her and nods that it should be passed

over to MARK. While that's happening--

The system uses one-level page tables,

which start at address 0x0400. Maybe you

want to have DMA. on your 16-bit system,

who knows? The first few pages are

reserved for hardware flags, etc.

MARK opens the note., It reads "Asshole".

He looks over and sees a couple of GIRLS looking at him with

contempt.

Assume page table entries have eight

status bits.

MARK closes his laptop, gets up and starts to head out of the

hall.

The eight status bits would be--

And I see we have our first surrender.

Don't worry, Mr. Zuckerberi12, brighter, men

than you have tried and failed at this

class.

1 valid bit, 1 modify bit, 1 reference

bit and 5 permission bits.

31.

MARK walks out of the lecture hall and we

EXT. ACADEMIC BUILDING - DAY

As MARK comes out and heads onto the quad--

Mark?

CAMERON and TYLER have been waiting by the entrance.

Are you Mark?

Yeah.

I'm Cameron winklevoss.

Tyler Winklevoss.

Are you guys related?

Good.

That's funny.

We've never heard that before.

Did I insult your girlfriends? What can I

do for you?

No, you didn't insult our girl--

Actually, I don't know.

We never asked.

We should do that.

32,

Yeah.

No, we have an idea we want to talk to

you about. Do you have a minute?

You guys look like athletes.

We are.

What do you do?

We row crew.

(pause---then smiles a little)

Yeah, I've got a minute.

INT. PORCELLIAN CLUB - DAY

The most exclusive of all the final clubs. DIIVYA is sitting in

the main living room with a textbook open as the heavy wooden

door opens and MARK is escorted in by TYLER and CAMERON.

You ever been in the Porcellian?

No.

We can't take you past the living room

but we can sit here and talk.

H i..

MARK is stealing a glance around the room...

Mark? This is Divya Narendra, our

partner.

Hi.

33.

We were really impressed with Facemash

and then we checked you out and you also

built CourseMatch.

MARK is looking at the framed black and white group pictures

on the wall. of old Porcellian classes. He sees a pretty co-ed

on the couch with her legs stretched over her boyfriend while

they study.

Mark?

Yeah .

CourseMatch. You go online, you get to

see what courses your friends are taking?

Yeah.

And you invented something in high

school.

An app for an MP3 player that recognizes

your taste in music.

Anybody try to buy it?

Microsoft.

How much did they pay?

I didn't sell it. I uploaded it for free.

MARK gives a short shrug that says both "I don't know" and

"Fuck you" at the same time.

3n,

Well we've been working for a while on an

idea. It's called HarvardConnecti.on. You

create your own page, Picture, bio,

interests, friends.

People can see your bio and request to be

Yeah. How's this different from MySpace

or Friendster?

How?

Yeah.

Harvard-dot-E--D-U.

Harvard.edu. The most prestigious e-mail

address in the country.

This site would be based on the idea that

girls want to meet guys who go to

Harvard. The difference between what

we're talking about and MySpace,

--is exclusivity,

Right?

Yes.

We want you to be an equal partner. Our

first programmer graduated and went to

work at Google. Our second programmer

just got overwhelmed with school work. We

want you to write the code and build the

site and we'll provide---

I'm in.

--the money. What?

I'm in.

INT. SECOND DEPOSITION ROOM -- DAY

The WINKLEVOSSES and DIVYA with GAGE.

"I'm in"?, that's what you said?

It was three or four years ago, I don't

know what I said.

INT. FIRST DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY

EDUARDO with GRETCHEN.

When did you come to Eduardo?

I don't understand that question.

INT. SECOND DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY

Do you remember answering in the

affirmative?

The affirmative?

INT. FIRST DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY

I'm asking when you came to Eduardo with

the idea for Facebook.

It was called TheFacebook back then.

TNT_ SECOND DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY

This doesn't need to be that difficult.

I'm in the middle of two different

lawsuits.

Did you answer affirmatively? When Tyler

and Cameron Winklevoss and Divya Narendra

asked you to build HarvardConnection, did

you say yes?

I said I'd help.

TNT. FIRST DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY

When did you approach Mr. Saverin with

the idea for TheFacebook?

I wouldn't say I approached him.

Sy?

You can answer the question.

It was at a party at Alpha Epsilon Pi.

What's that?

The Jewish fraternity. It was Caribbean

Night.

INT. LARGE LECTURE HALL - NIGHT

The lecture hall has been converted into "Alpha Epsilon Pi

Caribbean Night, 2003" and the party is about as lame as it

sounds. What's important is that this couldn't be less like

the final club party we saw at the beginning if they were

playing Pin the Tail on the Donkey.

Some potted palm trees have brought in along with a steel drum

set. The man playing the steel drum set has a yarmulke bobby

pinned to his thinning hair. A table with a punch bowl and

assorted cookies is nearby.

37.

EDUA.RDO, in baggy cargo shorts and a Hawaiian shirt buttoned

up to the top, is standing with a few similarly dressed

friends, including DUSTIN MOSKOWITZ and CHRIS HUGHES, in the

sparsely populated room. On the other side of the room are a

few girls--all Asian. One of the girls is wearing a bikini

over her clothes. A television monitor has been set up with a.

DVD running of Niagara Falls.

It's not that guys like me are generally

attracted to Asian girls. It's that Asian

girls are generally attracted to guys

like me.

I'm developing an algorithm to define the

connection between Jewish guys and Asian

girls.

I don't think it's that complicated.

They're hot, they're smart, they're not

Jewish and they can't dance.

Mark's here.

They see MARK come in and look around. EDUARDO waves him

over...

Mark.

MARK sees EDUARDO and waves him over to where he is. He wants

to talk privately.

I'll be back in a minute.

EDUARDO joins MARK in the back of the room and they take up a

spot next to a bay window that's covered on the outside with

ice.

I think I've come up with something.

Hang on, I've gotta tell you something

you're not going to believe.

What?

I got punched by the Phoenix.

38.

Are you kidding?

No. I mean it's just the first of the

four step process but they slipped the

invitation under my door tonight. T go to

the first punch party tomorrow and if

they like me--

Yeah.

--I get the second invitation and then

the third and then who knows?

You got punched by the Phoenix.

It was, you know ...I'm sure it was just a

diversity thing, And I'm never gonna make

it in, it was just a diversity thing. So

I'll just ride that'horse until--what did

you want to talk about?

Mark?

Yeah.

You said you think you've come up with

something.

It seems like MARK's just made a small decision in his head,

Yeah. I think I've come up with

something. Come outside.

It's 20 degrees outside.

I don't want to stare at that loop of

Niagara Falls which has absolutely

nothing to do with the Caribbean.

39.

EXT. QUAD NIGHT

MARK and EDUARDO come outside and are immediately met by the

freezing cold air.

People came to Facemash in a stampede,

right?

Yeah.

It wasn't because I put up pictures of

hot girls. You can go anywhere on the

internet and see pictures of hot girls.

Yeah.

It was because I put up pictures of girls

that people knew. So if people Want to go

on the internet and check out their

friends, why can't I build a website that

offers that? An online community of

friends. Pictures, profiles, whatever you

can click into, visit, browse around. All

from the privacy of your dorm room. I'm

not talking about a dating site. I'm

talking about taking the entire social

structure of college and putting it

online.

I can't feel my legs.

I know, I'm totally pumped about this.

INT. FIRST DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY

"It would be exclusive".

CUT BACK TO:

EXT. QUAD - NIGHT

--it would be exclusive. You'd have to

know the people on the site to get in.

Like getting punched.

40,

This is interesting.

Like our own Final club except not only

can we get into this one, we're the

president.

INT. FIRST DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY

I told him I thought it sounded great. I

mean it did, it was a great idea. There

was no reason to hack, people were going

to put their own pictures up. What they

were interested in, what they were

looking for, what classes they were

taking... and people had the ability to

invite their friends to join. Or put a

different way, not invite their friends

to join. In a world where social

structure is very important, that was

sexy.

It was a big project and he was going to

have to write tens ofathousands of lines

of code so I wondered why'he was coming

to me and not his roommates. Dustin

Moskowitz and Chris Hughes were

programmers.

EXT. QUAD - NIGHT

We're gonna need a little start-up cash

to rent'the servers and get it online.

INT. FIRST DEPOSITION ROOM - NIGHT

That was why.

Did he offer business terms?

41.

EXT. QUAD - NIGHT

We'll split it 70-30. 70 for me and 30

for you for putting up a thousand dollars

and handling everything on the business

end. You'll be CFO.

INT. FIRST DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY

And you said?

I said "Let's do it".

Okay. Did he add anything else?

Yes. He said---

EXT. QUAD - NIGHT

It probably was a. diversity thing but so

what?

INT. FIRST DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY

Why do you think he said that?

Gretchen, what's the relevancy?

This is discovery, I'm trying to

discover.

They're suggesting I was jealous of

Eduardo and began a plan to screw him out

of the company.

Were you?

42,

Jealous of Eduardo?

Stop typing, we're off the record.

Ma'am, I know you've done your homework

and so you know that money isn't a big

part of my life, but at the moment I

could buy Harvard University, take the

Phoenix Club and turn it into my ping

pong -room.

EXT. QUAD - NIGHT

EDUARDO's walking away and calls back to MARK--

I'll let you know how the party is,

We stay on MARK for a moment longer, his wheels turning,

INT. SECOND DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY

EDUARDO's in different:.clothes and being questioned by GAGE.

We recognize that you're a plaintiff in

one suit involving Facebook and a witness

in another.

Yes sir,

At any time in the three weeks prior to

Mark telling you his idea, did he mention

Tyler Winklevoss, Cameron Winklevoss,

Divya Narendra or HarvardConnection?

Yes. He said they'd asked him to work on

their site but that he'd looked at what

they had and decided it wasn't worth his

time. Uhh, he said even his most pathetic

friends knew more about getting people

interested in a website than these guys.

"These guys" meaning my clients.

43.

Yes. He resented--Mark resented that they-

--that your clients, probably thought he

would jump at the chance to rehabilitate

his image after the Facemash thing but

Mark didn't want to rehabilitate

anything. With Facemash he'd beaten the

Harvard computers, he'd beaten the Ad

Board and he made the girls mad. Facemash

did what he wanted it to do.

MARK kind of nods a little to himself. It should be noted that

these depositions have an extra element of dish ort as

everything is being said within a few feet of the peop" being

talked about.

Were you aware that while Mr. Zuckerberg

was building TheFacebook he was also

communicating with the plaintiffs?

Not at the time I wasn't. I am now.

Were you aware that while Mr. Zuckerberg

was building TheFacebook, he was leading

the plaintiffs to believe he was building

Harvard Connection?

I have some problems with that question.

No I wasn't.

MUSIC kicks in that will tie this next section together as we

INT. MARK'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT

Two printouts of web pages are taped to a white board--

"Friendster" and "MySpace". Under the two pages, MARK draws a

third page and titles it "TheFacebook".

Then he makes the decision to turn the capital "T" into a

lower case "t" and it becomes "theFacebook" as we

Harvard Connection and it seems like it

shouldn't take too long to implement, so

we can talk about it after I get all the

basic functionality up tomorrow night."

INT. MARK'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT

The whiteboard is filled with diagrams now under the heading

"theFacebook"--login page,, profile page, create account-We

move over to see MARK at his computer. He opens the Emacs

program and then Firefox, hits a few keys and the diagram on

the whiteboard comes-to life on his computer as we

them a casual "I'm not scared.of'ayou" look and we

The MUSIC CONTINUES as EDUARDO and other prospective new

members, all wearing tuxedos, are lined up in four rows. The

boy at the front of each row has a bottle of Jack Daniels and

drinks as long as they can before passing the bottle, relay

style, to the boy in back of him as a few seniors look on.

EDUARDO gets handed the bottle and starts in as we

TNT. CLASSROOM - DAY

It's an Art History class and as we run past the rows of

CAMERON, TYLER and DIVYA are reading the e-mail.

"I'm also really busy tomorrow."

Anybody else feel like there's something

up with this guy?

Tell him okay but we've gotta make sure

we meet before we all head off for break.

INT. EDUARDO'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT

EDUARDO's at his desk with his head in a thick textbook when

an envelope that says "Phoenix" is slipped under his door. Be

turns and looks to see it-then pumps his fist in victory as

TNT. MARK'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT

Every available wall space is covered with a diagram or a

printout. EDUARDO comes in with the envelope.

I need a dedicated Linux box running

Apache webserver with a mySQL backend.

It's gonna cost a little more money.

How much more?

Two-hundred more.

Do we need it?

To handle the traffic.

Do it.

I already did.

Hey, guess what?

It's snowing and cold as hell. EDUARDO's now with a smaller

group of prospective members, most of whom are in their

underwear with a couple of them wearing pants. They're all

blue and shivering. They're gathered around a statue of John

Harvard as a senior announces--

As the plaque reads, this is John

Harvard, founder of Harvard University in

1638. It's also called The Statue of

Three Lies. What are the three lies?

Sir!

Mr. Dowd,

The three lies--

Shit!

Take your pants off.

I know.

Mr. Saverin.

No shit.

looks down.

February 4th, 2003-

INT. COMPUTER SCIENCE LAB - DAY

MARK is working at a station. We can see through the windows

that it's a frigid, snowy February day in Cambridge but MARK'::

in his hoodie and cargo shorts nonetheless. It looks like he

hasn't slept in days.. On his monitor we can see that he's

working on the profile page for theFacebook.

DUSTIN MOSKOWITZ steps up to him quietly,

Mark?

Mark.

MARX turns his head and looks at him...

There's a girl in the art history class

that you take. Her name is Stephanie

Attic, Do you happen to know if she has a

boyfriend?

51.

MARK just keeps looking at him--barely even blinking---"Why am

I being interrupted?"

I mean, have you ever seen her with

anyone?

And if not, do you happen to know if

she's looking to go out with anyone?

Dustin. People don't walk around with a

sign on them that says--

And MARK stops short right there. Because in his head, he's

just discovered the cure for cancer.

Mark?

As MARK, with his backpack stuffed, comes flying out of the

building and into the snow, barely keeping his balance on the

ice and we

TNT. KIRKLAND HOUSE/LOBBY - MORNING

The heavy door bursts open and MARK comes busting through. He

makes his way with speed and intent up a flight of stairs.

Then another.

And then another until he gets to his floor. He sprints down

his hall toward his dorm room and barely notices EDUARDO

leaning against the door.

We were supposed to meet at 9.

MARK is searching the pockets of his shorts for his keys.

Have you slept yet?

MARK opens the door and they go into his suite--

I have to add a feature.

What are you adding?

52,

MARK's in his own world as he sits at the computer and calls

up theFacebook. The home page fills the screen.

Shit.

That looks good.

That looks really good.

It's clean and simple. No flashing

lights.

The CAMERA surveys the screen as MARK slips through some

functions to show EDUARDO and we see things that are now

familiar--A photo, sex, a profile, a list of attributes, a

poke application, etc.

MARK (cONT' T) )

But watch.

MARK's called up a the Emacs program and quickly writes out

several lines of code...

What'd you write?.

MARK goes back to the profile page. There's a new area to be

filled in...

"Relationship Status", "Interested In".

These two things are what drive life at

college. Are you having sex or aren't

you. It's why people take certain

classes, sit`where they sit, go where

they go, do what they do, and at its, um,

center,`you know, that's what theFacebook

is gonna be about, People are gonna log

on because after all the cake and

watermelon there's a chance they're gonna-

--meet a girl.

--get laid. Yes.

Really?

And that's it.

53.

What do you mean?

It's ready.

It's ready?

Yeah.

Right now?

It's ready, that was it. And here's the

masthead,

MARK hits another couple of keystrokes and the website's

masthead comes up.

You made a masthead.

Yeah.

"Eduardo Saverin, Co-Founder and CFO."

Yeah.

You have no idea how much that's going to

mean to my father.

Sure I do.

When's it gonna go live?

Right now. Get your laptop out.

Why do we need my laptop?

Because you've got e-mails for everyone

at the Phoenix.

54,

I'm not sure if it's gonna be cool with

them that I spammed their--

It's not Spam.

I didn't mean Spam, it's not Spam, it's

If we send it to our friends it'll just

bounce around the computer lab,

I haven't gotten in yet.

These guys know people and these guys

know girls. I need their e-mails.

Sure.

EDUARDO takes out his laptop--

Let's start with the president.

"Jabberwockl2@Harvard E-D-U."

Like the Lewis Carrol?

Yeah.

MARK opens up an e-mail and is writing a short message, then

includes a link to the site--

These guys.

I know,

Think they're literary geniuses because

the world's most obvious Lewis Carroll

reference is in their--

They're not so bad.

55.

I'm just saying.

You're right.

Okay.

He hits "Send".

The site's live.

You know what? Let's go get a drink and

celebrate.

MARK is staring at the computer...

Mark?

MARK doesn't hear him. We just see MARK's head from the back

and it's ever so slightly bobbing back and forth...

Mark?

Are you praying?

INT. CAMPUS PUB - NIGHT

THE CROCODILLOS, Harvard's oldest male a Capella group, are

singing at the front of the pub in their usual uniform of

white tie and tails.

Incongruously, but with surprisingly nice results, the group

is covering a song from The Backstreet-Boys--"I Want it That

Way"--and the pub full of students is loving it.

We find a table in the back where DIVYA is sitting with some

of his friends who are having a nice time. DIVYA's got his

laptop open.

When did the Crocodillos start covering

the Backstreet Boys? What happened to

Cole Porter and Irving Berlin?

56,

It's a Valentine's theme. They're singing

love songs.

Good point, 'cause Cole Porter and Irving

Berlin never wrote any love songs,

Divya, what are you reading?

Seven different people spammed me the

same link.

We see DIVYA click his mouse on the link--

What is it?

I don't know, but I'm really hoping it's

video of kittens that look like the Marx

Brothers 'cause I can never get enough

file footage on my computer of animals

doing...

DIVYA trails off. We Slowly PUSH IN on his face as the blood

starts draining away...

Div?

(beat.)

I--uh...I have to go.

DIVYA shuts his laptop, grabs it off the table and starts to

bolt out of the pub. His foot gets caught on a chair leg and

he falls hard face-first to the floor.

Shit.

He starts out again, then comes back for his coat, grabs it;

starts out and falls down all over again.

Finally he's got it together and flies out of the pub and we

CAMERON and TYLER are rowing in a large practice tank--a

simulator with a hull, oars and rowable water.

They're focused and charging away in perfect sync when the

door at the end of the century-old boathouse opens and DIVYA

charges In from the co:Ld with his laptop and a copy of the

Crimson in his hands.

Hey!

The twins are in the zone and don't pay any attention.

Hey !

Not now, we've got another 5000 meters.

Okay. I just wanted to let you know

TYLER stops rowing and then CAMERON. They look at DIVYA...

Mark Zuckerberg stole our website. It's

been live for over 36 hours.

INT. CAMERON AND TYLER' S DORM ROOM - NIGHT

They're in gear. CAMERON's taken a quick shower but didn't dry

off'. He's in sweatpants with a towel over his shoulder,

talking on the phone with his father and holding the Crimson.

DIVYA's on his cell looking for MARK and TYLER, still in his

practice clothes, has his desktop computer open to theFacebook

and is studying it.

I left a message with his R.A., I left

two, now I'm leaving one here.

I'm looking at the article in the

Crimson.

headline is "Facemash creator seeks new

"Welcome to theFacebook, TheFacebook is

an online directory that connects people

through social networks. You must have a

Harvard.edu address to register."

That's right.

59.

I called earlier. I'm looking for Mark

Zuckerberg.

Yes sir, he's quoted a couple of times. I

can read--it says, "'Everyone's been

talking a lot about a universal .facebook

within 1 arvard', he says"--he meaning

Mark--"I think it's kind of silly that it

would take the University a coupl-e-af

years to get around to it. I can do A

better than they can and I did in a

week."

Could you leave word that Divya Narendra

called, I appreciate it.

I know, that's how he talks.

(off another copy of the

"As of yesterday evening, Zuckerberg said

over 650 students had registered to use

theFacebook.com. He said he anticipated

that 900 students would have joined the

site by this morning."

Yeah, Divya was just reading that he'd

signed up 650 people on the first day.

free drugs to 650 people in one day.

And this kid doesn't have four friends.

(quieting them so he can hear)

Guys, please, for just one second.

That's what we'll do, Mr. Hotchkiss.

We're gonna put it all, together right now

and e-mail it to you.

You won't be able to get on the site

yourself.

(beat--.a little uncomfortable)

60.

Because you went to Ohio State. But we'll

take care of everything and we'll talk to

you first thing in the morning. This is a

Whoa !. ;

--and he's very bright and I'm sure he

didn't mean to...do what he did.

Thank you very much, and dad, we'll talk

to you in the morning too. Thanks.

CAMERON hangs up,

This is a good guy?

We don't know that he'.s not a good guy.

We know that he took our idea and stole

it. We know that-he lied to. our faces for

a month and a half-while he--

He didn't lie to our faces.

He never saw our. faces! Fine, he lied to

our e-mail accounts and he got himself a

42-day head start because he knows what

apparently you don't which is that

getting there first is everythinal

I'm a competitive racer, Div, I don't

think you need to school me on the

importance of getting there first.

Alright. That was your father's lawyer on

the phone with you?

Yeah, well his in-house counsel, We're

gonna send him everything and he'll look

at it and if he thinks it's appropriate

he'll send a cease and desist letter.

61.

A cease and desist letter doesn't have

any teeth.

You think we should hire lawyers and sue

him?

I think we should hire lawyers and have

them beat him senseless with a crescent

wrench.

We don't have to do that.

That's right.

We can do it ourselves.

I'm six-five, 220-pounds and there are

two of me.

And I'm saying let's Calm down until we

know what we're talking about.

Just how much more information are you

waiting for? We met with Mark three

times, we exchanged 52 e-mails, we can

prove that he looked at the code, he'd

seen what Victor had already done and we

talked at length about what we planned to

do.

The page looks the same:

What is that on the bottom?

(he's already seen it)

It says "A Mark Zuckerberg Production".

On the home page?

On every page.

62 .

Hang on, 'cause I need a minute to let

the classiness waft over me.

Cam.

(he recites from the Crimson

thout having to read it)

They wr "Zuckerberg said that he

hoped the prly options would help to

restore his reputation following student

outrage over Facemash.com".

That's exactly what we said to him. He's

telling us to go fuck ourselves. We know

plenty of people at the Crimson. While

we're waiting for dad's lawyer to look

this over, we can at least---

No.

--get something going in the paper so

that people know-

What?

That this thing is in dispute.

We're not starting a knife fight in the

Crimson and we're not suing anybody.

Why not?

CAMERON wants-to answer the question but doesn't..

Why not?

(beat--referring to TYLER)

He'll say it's stupid.

Me?

Yeah.

63.

Say it. Why not?

Because we're gentlemen of Harvard.

This is Harvard. You don't plant stories

and you don't sue people.

That's why. There's a right way to do

things.

You thought be was going to be the only

one who thought that was stupid?

INT. SECOND DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY

During the time when you say you had this

idea, did you know that Cameron and Tyler

carne from a family of means?

A family of means?

Did you know that his father was wealthy.

I'm not sure why you're asking me that.

It's not important that you be sure why

I'm asking you.

It's not important to you.

(asking for help again)

Sy.

Did you know that they came from money?

I had no idea whether they came from

money or not.

64,

In one of your e-mails to Mr. Narendra

you reference Tate Winklevoss' consulting

firm.

If you say so.

Tate Winklevoss founded the firm and its

assets are in the hundreds of millions.

or roughly the amount I paid in income

tax last year, go on.

You also knew that Cameron and Tyler were

members of a Harvard final club called

the Porcellian.

They made a point of pointing that out.

Excuse us for inviting you in.

Hey.

So it's safe to say you were aware that

my clients had money?

Yes.

Let.me tell you why I'm asking. I'm

wondering why, if you needed a thousand

dollars to start up your project, you

didn't ask my clients for it. They'd

demonstrated to you an interest in this

kind of thing so--

From that you're deducing that I didn't

go to them because I didn't want them to

know what I was working on? I went to my

best friend for the money because he's

who I wanted to be partners with because

of our similar vision and his superior

business skills. Eduardo was president of

the Harvard Investors Association and he

was my best friend.

65.

Your best friend is suing you for 600-

million dollars.

I hadn't heard, tell me more.

INT. FIRST DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY

Eduardo, what happened after the initial

launch?

I'm sorry, Sy, would you mind addressing

him as Mr. Saverin?

They're best friends, Gretchen.

Not anymore.

We just went through this on the--

nevermind. Mr. Saverin, what happened

after the initial--

It exploded.

INT. SECOND DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY

Everyone on campus was using it.

"Facebook me" was a common expression

after two weeks.

And Mark?

Mark was the biggest thing on a campus

that included 19 Nobel. Laureates, 15

Pulitzer Prize winners, two future

Olympians and a movie star.

Who was the movie star?

Does it matter?

66,

No.

EXT./EST. AUDITORIUMi - NIGHT

The lamps in Harvard Yard light the snow falling.

The seminal event for me was when he was

in Harvard Square and picked up a copy of

Popular Electronics Magazine that ha the

MITS Altair Kit on the cover.

INT. AUDITORIUM -- SAME TIME

There's a lower-level and a balcony and both are full.

MARK and EDUARDO are sitting in the second to last row of the

balcony.

We'll hear the SPEAKER but we'll only get to see him in a

slightly blurry image as our attention is on MARK and EDUARDO.

And it was a clear day, And I was up in

my Radcliffe dorm. And he brought that up

there and said, "Look, it's going to

happen without us. We've got to do it

now." And so I said..."Okay."

He gets an appreciative LAUGH from the STUDENTS.

Now the startingaof this industry was

very humble indeed. The kit computer on

the cover-of that magazine--

We HEAR a little muffled giggling coming from the row behind

MARK and EDUARDO, MARK is too into the speech to notice but

the giggling registers as a slight annoyance on EDUARDO's

face.

--had an 8080 processor in it, and you

had to assemble it yourself and it came

with 256K of memory.

EDUARDO hears the giggling again and turns around.

In the row behind them and a few seats over are two beautiful

Asian students.--ALICE and JENNY. They're a little overly made-

up for a lecture. JENNY, the one sitting closest to EDUARDO,

is wearing a short skirt with a white shirt: open one button

too far down the front and we can see a hint of the red bra

she's wearing underneath.

67.

She leans forward and whispers to EDUARDO--

Your friend--isn't that Mark Zuckerberg?

You know Mark?

Didn't he make theFacebook?

EDUARDO smiles a little ...this has just never happened--

Yeah. Both of us. It's mine and his. It's

our--we're--yes.

Way cool. I'm Jenny. This is Alice.

EDUARDO can't help noticing--just because it's in his line of

sight--that down the row from the girls, someone else is

pointing at them and whispering to a friend.

Then back to the girls--

Very nice to meet you.

Facebook me when you get home. Maybe we

can all go out for a drink later.

Certainly. I'll certainly--absolutely I

will do that.

EDUARDO turns back to the speaker, who MARK hasn't taken his

eyes off of--

There were a set of machines that came

after that. The TRS-80, Apple II,

68.

EXT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

As the CROWD from the lecture spills out onto the snowy quad.

EDUARDO--always in his suit-.-is buttoning up his overcoat as

he walks and MARK zips up his hoodie.

She said "Facebook me" and we can all

have a drink later. Which is stunningly

great for two reasons. One, she said

"Facebook me". Right? And the other is

that, you know--

They want to have drinks later.

Yes: Have you ever heard so many

different good things packed into one

ordinary-sized sentence?

A group of guys hustle up to MARK and EDUARDO--

Excuse me. Mark?

Yeah.

I'm Stuart Singer. I'm in your O.S. lab.

Sure.

Awesome job with theFacebook.

Awesome job.

Thanks.

I'm Bob.

How you doin'.

You know, I could swear he was looking at

you when he said the next Bill Gates

could be right in this room.

I doubt it.

69.

I showed up late, I don't even know who

he was.

It was Bill Gates.

Oh shit, that makes sense.

As MARK and EDUARDO walk on, we leave STUART, VIKRAM and BOB in

the background---with STUART and VIKRAM admonishing BOB with--

Are you a moron?/Are you medically

stupid?/You can't recognize Bill Gates

when he's standing in front of you for an

hour?/Mark Zuckerberg now thinks we got

into Harvard on a dimwit scholarship./I'm

gonna get a Glock 39 and I'm going to

kill you./I'm actually going to kill

you/etc.

INT. MARK'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT

As the door opens and MARK and EDUARDO come into the

overheated warmth of the room.

It's time to monetize the thing.

Those Asian girls were cute. What were

their names?

Did you hear what I said?

When?

I said it's time to monetize the site.

What does that mean?

I mean it's time for the website to

generate revenue.

70,

No I know what the word means. I'm asking

how do you want to do it?

Advertising.

No. What were their names?

We've got 4000 members.

'Cause theFacebook is cool. If we start

installing pop-ups for Mountain Dew it's

Well I wasn't thinking it would be

Mountain Dew but at some point--and I'm

speaking as the business end of the

We don't even know what it is yet. We

don't know what it is, what it can be,

what it will be. We know it'as cool,

that's a -priceless asset and we're not

giving it up.

EDUARDO is sitting at MARK's desk and he's seen something

sitting on top of a pile of'books.,,

Mark, what is this?

What,

EDUARDO holds up a letter that's on a lawyer's stationary.

This,

I think it's called a cease and desist

letter. What were their names?

Who?

The girls.

EDUARDO's speed reading the letter.

71.

When did you get this?

About 10 days ago. Right after we

Jesus Christ.

I liked th shorter one.

They're saying--the Winklevoss twins are

saying you stole their idea.

I find that to be mildly annoying.

They find it to be property theft. Why--

--why didn't you show this to me?

It was addressed to me.

They're saying we stole theFacebook from

Divya Narendra and the Winka

I know what it says.

Did we?

What?

Please don't screw around with me now.

I'm not.

Look at me.

What are you, my mother?

72.

The letter says we could face legal

action.

No, it says I could face legal action.

It's from a lawyer, Mark. They must feel

they have some grounds for--

The lawyer is their father's house

counsel, I checked it out, they're not,

Do they have grounds?

Yes, the grounds are theFacebook is cool.

and popular and sexy and

HarvardConnection is lame. I didn't use

any of their code, I didn't use anything.

A guy who builds a really nice chair

doesn.'t owe money to everyone who,,, ever

built a chair. Th ey came to me with an

idea, I had a better one.

Why didn't you show me the letter?

I didn't think. it was a big deal..

If there's' something wrong--if there's

ever anything wrong--you can tell me. I'm

the guy who can help.

Is there anything you need to tell me?

No,

What are we doing about this?

I went to a 3-L at Student Legal services

and he told me to write them back.

What did you say?

73.

TNT. SECOND DEPOSITION ROOM DAY

"When we met in January, I expressed my

doubts about the site--where it stood

with graphics, how much programming was

left that I had not anticipated--

INT. MARK'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT

"---the lack of hardware we had to deal

with, the lack of promotion that was

needed to successfully launch the website--

INT. SECOND DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY

"--etc." This was the first time you

raised any of those concerns, right?

I'd raised concerns before.

Bullshit./Not to us.

Fellas.

(back to MARK)

I'm talking about at the meeting in

January to which this letter is

referring.

Yeah.

clients 32 e-mails. In the first 31, you

Is that a question?

In the 32nd e-mail you raised concerns

about the site's functionality. Were you

leading them on for six weeks?

No.

Why hadn't you raised any of these--

It's snowing.

I'm sorry?

It just started snowing.

Mr. Zuckerberg, do I have your full

attention?

No.

Do you think I deserve it?

. MARK

What.

Do you think I deserve your full

attention?

I had to swear an oath before we began

the deposition phase and I don't want to

get arrested for perjury so I have a

legal obligation to say no.

Okay. "No" you don't think I deserve your

attention.

I think if your clients want to stand on

my shoulders and call themselves tall

they have a right to give it a try. But

there's no requirement that I enjoy being

here listening to people lie. You have

part of my attention--the minimum amount

needed.

75.

The rest of my attention is back at the

offices of Facebook where my employees

and I are doing things that no one in

this room, including and especially your

clients, are intellectually or creatively

capable of doing. Did I adequately answer

your condescending question?

GAGE just looks casually at MARK. MARK doesn't meet his gaze,

or the looks from DIVYA, TYLER and CAMERON...

I've got 12:45. Why don't we.say that's

lunch.

Back at 2:30?

Good.

Everyone gets np and we

INT. MARK'S DORM ROOM -a NIGHT

EDUARDO puts the letter back on. the desk and looks at MARK...

Their names were Jenny and Alice- They

want to have drinks tonight.

INT. MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

It's a nice men's room--mahopny stalls--in a nice club in

Cambridge. We HEAR the thumping of the house music coming from

the club.

And then one of the wooden stall doors flies open and EDUARDO

is shoved in, followed by JENNY, who did the shoving. She's

all over him as she presses him back against the divider.

EDUARDO's hands are sliding under JENNY'S white shirt and

finding the red bra when they hear a noise.

Someone's gone into the next stall.

Shit.

76.

I don't care.

JENNY keeps him pinned against the divider as she reaches down

and unbuckles his belt.

(quietly--nervous).

Oh God.

That's right.

And then he hears another noise from the stall next door. A

thump against the divider. JENNY's got his fly unzipped.

EDUARDO looks down at the space between the stalls. He sees a

pair of Adidas flip-flops.

Then the sound of moaning, Before EDUARDO has time to say

anything, JENNY pulls her shirt open, revealing the red bra,

and puts her hand down his pants as we

INT. CLUB/MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT

MARK and EDUARDO are standing guard outside the door. They're

silent but very happy.

A guy comes along to use the men's room.

Sorry. It'll just be a minute. Some girls

are freshening up in there.

(nodding a little)

Sweet.

The guy goes off...

Mark.

We have groupies.

MARK can't help a smile. Then he sees something...

I'll be right back.

Where you going?

77.

MARK makes his way through the crowd toward a round booth. A

girl is sitting there and even though her back is to MARK he

can recognize her. She's with a girlfriend and three guys.

When he makes it to the booth he says--

Erica?

ERICA, from the opening scene, turns her head and looks up to

see MARK. She's looking sexy for her Friday ni.ght on the town

and the three guys she's with are studs. A few more friends of

theirs are standing around at the edges of the booth.

Hi Mark.

I saw you from over there. I didn't know

you came to this club a lot.

It's my first time.

Mine too. It's not bad. It's not. great.

The music's kind of lame. Could I talk to

you alone for a second?

I think I'm good right here.

okay.

MARK is aware of everyone else around the booth.

I don't know if you heard about this new

website I launched.

No.

ThePacebook?

You called me a bitch on the internet,

Mark.

I'm really sorry about that.

78.

On the internet.

That's why I came over.

comparing women to farm animals?

I didn't end up doing that.

It didn't stop you from writing it. As if

every thought that tumbles through your

head is so clever it would be a crime for

it not to be published. The internet's

not written in pencil, Mark, it's written

in ink and you published that Erica

Albright was a bitch.

Right before you made some ignorant crack

about my family's name, published my bra

size and then rated women-based on their

hotness. Why don't you say it to me now,

why don't say it to my face?

I don't want to.

REGGIE (A FRIEND OF ERICA'S)

Erica, is there a problem?

No, there's no problem.

You're not a real person, Mark. You write

your bullshit from a dark room because

you're a failure at human contact. I

liked you and I was nice to you.

I came over to say I was sorry for all

that and to see if there was any chance--

I don't want to be rude to my fxiends, I

should be talking to them.

Okay.

Hey Mark. A year from now you won't

remember this conversation and you won't

remember me.

'79 .

I think you're wrong.

Well... listen, good luck with your video

game.

It was an honest mistake on ERICA's part but a kidney punch to

MARK.

Okay.

MARK turns and goes and sees that EDUARDO has been standing at

and watching from a distance with JENNY.

That was cool, you did good. You talked

to her, that was the right thing to do.

It was good, Mark.

We have to expand.

(over the music)

What?

We have to expand.

And MARK heads out the door.

EDUARDO watches MARK and then looks back at the girls and

answers the un-asked question--

I don't know.

Is he mad about something?

INT. MARK'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT

The door closes behind DUSTIN MOSKOWITZ and CHRIS HUGHES. MARK

and EDUARDO are waiting and JENNY and ALICE are sitting on the

bed. Everyone's got a beer.

Once the door is closed--

80.

We're expanding theFacebook to Yale and

Columbia. Dustin, I want you to share. the

coding work with me. Chris, you're going

to be in charge. of publicity and

outreach. You can start by getting a

story about the expansion in the B.U.

student newspaper.

They hate doing stories about Harvard.

Somebody at the newspaper will be a

computer science major and they will have

heard of me. Tell 'em Mark Zuckerberg

will do 10 hours of free programming for

theno .

Why do you want a story in the B.U.---

Because I do. Here's the business

arrangement. Eduardo's CFO and owns 30%

of the company, Dustin's Vice President

and Head of Programming and his 5% of the

company will come from my end. Chris is

Director of Publicity and his

compensation will depend on the amount of

work he ends up doing. Any questions?

Who are the girls?

Jenny and Alice,

Is there anything we can do?

No. That's it. Yale and Columbia, let's

go.

And Stanford.

What?

Stanford. Its time for them to see this

in Palo Alto.

INT. FIRST DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY

MARK is sitting alone in the now empty room. There's a

computer on a table in the corner and MARK makes a few

keystrokes and then reads the screen.

MARYLIN, the young lawyer we met early on, comes in with a

plastic salad container in her hand and sits at the far end of

the table from MARK, who doesn't acknowledge her.

(after a moment)

You don't want any lunch?

No.

You're welcome to some of my salad.

No thank you.

I know this must be hard.

who are you?

I'm Marylin Delpy, I introduced myself

this morning.

I mean what do you do?

I'm a second year associate at the firm.

My boss wanted me to sit in on the

deposition phase.

MARK nod--.

What are you doing?

Checking in to see how it's going in

Bosnia.

Bosnia?

MARK nods...

They don't have roads but they have

Facebook?

MARK nods..,

You really hate the Winklevoss twins,

don't you.

I don't hate anybody.

The Winklevi aren't suing me for

intellectual property-theft. They're

suing me because for the first time in

their lives the world didn't work the way

it was supposed to for them.

INT. TYLER AND CAMERON'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT

TYLER and CAMERON are both studying when DIVYA busts in.

He's expanding.

What?

He's expanding to Yale, Columbia and

Stanford, it'll be in the Crimson

tomorrow.

Really.

Yeah.

83.a

So that cease and Desist letter really

scared the shit out of him, huh?

I want to hire a lawyer to file for

injunctive relief and get this website

taken down now!

Every minute it's up, Harvard Connection

becomes less valuable, I want an

injunction, I watt damages, punitive

relief and I want him dead.

I want those things too!

Then why aren't we doing anything about

it?! Because we're gentlemen of Harvard?!

Because you're not thinking about how

it's going to look.

How's it going to look?

Like my brother and I are dressed in

skeleton costumes chasing the Karate Kid

around a high school gym.

He violated Massachusetts state law. Then

when he goes to Connecticut, New York and

California he'll have violated federal

law. And by the way, he's violated

Harvard law.

There's no such thing as Harvard Law.

Wait. Yes there is.

Cam, there is.

TYLER goes to the bookshelf and pulls down a manual.

84,

Harvard Student Handbook. Every freshman

is issued this book. Somewhere in here it

--you can't steal from another student.

This is what we needed.

You think campus security is going to

arrest him for copyright violation?

We're going to meet with the president.

You can't get a meeting with Larry

Summers.

My brother and I pay tuition at this

school, we carry a 3.9 GPA at this

school, we've won trophies for this

school and we'll be rowing in the

Olympics for this school. I want a damn

meeting with the-president of this

school.

Why Stanford?

Why do you think?

INT. A GIRL'S COLLEGE APARTMENT (PALO ALTO) - MORNING

A pretty 20 year-old co-ed, AMY, pulls a curtain open and the

darkened room immediately fills with un-welcomed sunlight.

You don't know my name, do you?

AMY's wearing nothing but a Stanford sweatshirt and talking to

a skinny 22 year-old guy who's lying on her futon. There's

other evidence on the walls that we're at Stanford University.

There are also pieces of AMY'S clothing strewn about.

The young man on the futon is SEAN PARKER.

Is that something that's important to y ou?

85.

Yes.

If I say your name will you stop the

enhanced interrogation techniques?

Yes.

Amy.

Nice. What's my major?

Trombone.

Really?

I remember something about a trombone.

That was the beer bong. Tu fais l'amour A

la jolie fille et la mete de cote.

French! Your major is French.

Oui. And what's yours?

My major?

Yes.

I don't have one.

You haven't declared?

I don't go to school here.

You're kidding?

No.

86.

Where do you go to school?

Grover Cleveland Elementary.

Seriously, you're not like 15 years old

or anything are you?

No, I'm 22.

You're not like 15 years---

No.

Good.

So what do you do?

I'm an entrepreneur.

You're unemployed.

I wouldn't say that.

What would you say?

That I'm an entrepreneur.

.AMY

What was your latest preneur?

Well...I founded an internet company that

let college kids download and share music

for free.

Kind of like Napster?

No, exactly like Napster.

What do you mean?

87.

I founded Napster.

Sean Parker founded Napster.

Nice to meet you.

You're Sea - arker?

Ah, you see, the shoe's on the other, uh,

table which has turned.

I just slept with Sean Parker?

All night long, Sister Souljah.

You're a millionaire.

Not technically.

What are you?

Technically?

Yeah.

Broke. There's not a lot of money in free

music. Even less when you're being sued

by everyone who's ever been invited to

the Grammys.

I think you're cool.

He too.

I have to hop in the shower and get ready

for class. There's juice or anything else

you can find. Help yourself.

You mind if I check my e-mail?

88,

Go ahead.

AMY heads into the bathroom but leaves the door a little ajar..

SEAN steps over to AMY's pink laptop and hits a key to wake it

out of sleep mode.

The shower starts running in the bathroom.

The laptop springs to life and is open to something SEAN's

never seen before--a Facebook page.;

He sees AMY's picture and a short profile: Her major at

Stanford, courses she's taking, books she likes, clubs she's a.

member of...

Amy?

She can't hear him in the shower.

SEAN explores around a little more. He knows his way around a

computer. He sees her "friends". Friend after friend after

friend.

SEAN (CONY' D )

(almost a whisper)

Jesus.

He gets up and goes to the bathroom door--

Amy?

Can'you come out here?

Just a second.

There's a fire, Amy.

AMY.

What?!

AMY grabs a towel and jumps out of the shower--

Where?:

89.

Okay, there isn't a fire, but I need to

ask you something.

Are you kidding?!

No.

I could have been killed!

I3ow?

What do you need to ask me?

I went to check my e-mail and there's a

website open on your computer.

Yeah. After you went unconscious last

night I went on theFacebook for a while.

What's that?

'iheFacebook? It. started at Harvard and

standford's had it for about two weeks

and it's awesome except it's addictive.

Seriously, I'm on the thing five times a

day, all my friends are.

You mind if I grab a piece of paper and a

pen?

What's wrong?

Absolutely nothing. It's beautiful.

What are you talking about?

I need to find...

INT. LARRY SUMMERS' OUTER OFFICE - DAY

CAMERON and TYLER, in dark suits, are waiting to see the

president of Harvard,

The President's office is in one of the two oldest university

buildings in the country, and the SECRETARY sitting at the

desk i ven older. You get the sense that she thinks Harvard

would be d -better place if it weren't for all, these students.

She looks at them and the boys give her a polite smile and a

small nod before she goes back to her work.

(just making small talk)

I've never been in this building.

(without really looking up)

This building is a hundred years older

than the country.it's in.

Hm.

So do be careful.

We're just siting in the chairs.

Yes_.

Very good.

She hangs up the phone.

You can go in now.

She points to a door and CAMERON and TYLER get up, quickly

straighten themselves, and walk into

INT. SUMMERS' OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

LARRY SUMMERS, a large man, is on the phone at his desk in his

well-appointed office. A fire crackles in the sitting area and

a 40-ish African-American woman, ANNE, in a pants suit is

nearby going over some papers.

91.

SUMMERS waves the boys in--

That's just their own stupidity, I should

have been there.

Darkness is the absence of light and

stupidity in that instance was the

absence of me.

SUMMERS motions for them to sit and they do. They take in some

of the photographs around the room---SUMMERS with BILL CtINTON,

etc.

Catherine, I have students in my office

now.

Students.

Under. grads.

I don't know, from the looks of it I

think they want to sell me sets of

identical Brooks Brothers suits. We'll

speak later.

SUMMERS hangs up the phone--

Good morning.

Good morning, s_ir. I'm Cameron Winklevoss

and this is my brother, Tyler.

CAMERON is extending his hand but instead of taking it,

SUMMERS reaches to the top of a pile of papers and pulls a ten-

page letter off the top.

Why are you here?

There's silence while SUMMERS appears to read over the

letter...

That wasn't rhetorical.

I'm sorry, I thought you were reading the

letter.

I've read the letter.

92.

Well I think it's pretty self-

explanatory. We had an idea for a website

called HarvardConnection--we've since

changed the name to ConnectU--and Mark

Zuckerberg stole that idea and--

What do you want me to do about it?

CAMERON points to a row of Harvard Student Handbooks on the

bookshelf behind SUMMERS.

Well sir, in The Harvard Student

Handbook, which is distributed to each

freshman--under the heading "Standards of

Conduct in the Harvard Community" and the

sub-heading, "Honesty"--

Oh dear God.

--it says, "The College expects that all

students will be honest and forthcoming

in their dealings with members of this

community. All students are required to

respect private and public ownership.

Instances of theft, misappropriation or

unauthorized use of or damage to property

Excuse me, Anne?

Yes sir.,

Punch me in the face.

(beat--then to CAMERON)

Go ahead-.

--will result in disciplinary action,

including the requirement to withdraw

from the College." That's what is says in

the handbook.

When did you memorize that?

(a little frustrated with this

93.

TYLER (CONY ' D )

Sir, it's against University rules to

steal. from another student, plain and

simple.

You've spoken to your R,A.?

Yes sir, and the R.A. made a

recommendation to the Ad Board but the Ad

Board won't hear us.

Have you tried dealing with Mr.

Zuck.e.rberg directly?

Mr. Zuckerberg hasn't responded to any of

our e-mails or phone calls for. the last'

two weeks. He doesn't answer when we

knock on his door at Kirkland and the

closest we've come to talking face to

face is when I saw him on. the quad and

chased him through Harvard Square.

You chased him?

I saw him and I know he saw me and I

started after him and he disappeared

You know he could have you arrested for

harassment and attempted assault.

This isn't happening.

I don't see this as a University issue.

Of course it's a University issue.

There's a code of ethics and an honor

code and he violated them both.

You entered into a code of ethics with

the university, not with each other.

I'm sorry President Summers, what you

just said makes no sense to me at all.

94,

I'm devastated by that.

What my brother means is that if Mark

Zuckerberg walked into our dorm room and

stole our computer it would be a

university issue, right?

I really don't know. This office doesn't

handle petty larceny and the only reason

I agreed to see you--Anne; by did I

agree to see them?

Colleagues of their father.

So you see?

This isn't a petty larceny.

This idea is potentially worth millions

of dollars.

Millions of dollars?

Yes.

You might be letting your imagination run

away with you.

With all due respect I don't think you're

in any position to make that call.

I was U.S. Treasury Secretary, I'm in

some position to make that call.

Letting our imaginations run away with us

is exactly what we were told to do in

your freshmen address.

95.

Well. I would try letting your-

imaginations run away with you on a new

project.

You would.

Everyone at Harvard is inventing

something or starting a new business in

their dorm room- Harvard undergraduates

believe that inventing a job is better

than getting one so can I suggest again

that the two of you come up with a new

new project?

I'm sorry, but that-'s not the point, sir.

What's the point?

You don't have to be an intellectual

property expert to understand-the,

difference between right and wrong.

And you're saying that I don't?

Of course I'm not saying that.

I'm saying that.

SUMMERS looks at TYLER and then smiles...

Just start another project? Like we're

making a diorama for the science fair?

Yes. And if you have a goddam problem

with that, Mr. Winklevoss, the courts are

always at your disposal. Athletes don't

get special treatment at this school.

Do they get fairness?

They don't get to run to daddy. Okay?

This isn't 50 years ago.

96,

Excuse me, sir, but in your analogy, is

daddy our father or you?

Both. Is there anything else I can do for

you?

Well I wouldn't mind that much if you

took a flying--

Ty.

Thank you for your time, sir. We

appreciate your seeing us.

Get the door on your way out, would you?

INT. SUMMERS OUTER OFFICE - DAY

As CAMERON and TYLER exit, TYLER closes the door a little too

hard and the brass doorknob comes off in his hand. He drops it

on the SECRETARY'S desk as he exits

I broke your 335 year old doorknob.

INT. FIRST DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY

Eduardo, spring break, you and Mr.

Zuckerberg took a trip to New York.

Yes.

What was the purpose of the trip?

As CFO, I'd set up some meetings with

potential advertisers.

Who paid for the trip?

97.

It was paid for out of the thousand

dollar account I'd set up a few months

earlier.

At this point your thousand dollars was

the only money that had been put into the

company.

Yes.

66 is a hip and trendy restaurant in Tribeca. The young crowd

is drinking cocktails of all different colors and wearing

Prada, We FIND EDUARDO,.in a three-piece suit and MARK in his

hoodie and flip-flops, along with EDUARDO's now-girlfriend,

JENNY, sitting at a table. with an empty seat waiting.

He's 25 minutes late.

He's not a god-

What is he?

I think Wardo's jealous.

He's here.

SEAN PARKER has stepped into the restaurant and is. saying

hello to the hostess while hugging a waitress.

And he does own a watch.

SEAN stops at a table to shake hands with a guy in a suit and

kiss his girlfriend. It's sort of an incongruous sight--this

22 year old kid who's able to work a room like Sinatra. Who

the hell is this?

INT. FIRST DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY

From that point on it was a Sean-a-thon.

I'd never seen anyone perform a monologue

at dinner before but that's what

happened.

INT. 66 - NIGHT

The CA[ERA is moving around the table as SEAN--in and out of

MOS-a-is telling story after story while food is brought,

drinks put down, more food brought and more drinks put down.

MARK is enthralled, JENNY is sexy and EDUARDO is polite.

EDUARDO (V.O.)

He took us through his episode with

Napster .

. tried to sell the company to pay the

35 million they said we owed in royalties

and in the end we just had to declare

bankruptcy but I made a name for myself.

I'll say.

EDUARDO (V.o.)

And then he went to his second business

venture which was Plaxo, an online

rolodex.

See, we had a VC from the beginning.

Michael Moritz, a partner at Sequoia

Capital who'd invested in Yahoo and

Google. Moritz wanted to push me out from

ginning and he hired private detectives to dig up everything on me

they could. Did they find anything? No.

But I was out of the company. I'm not

done with Moritz and Sequoia Capital yet.

I swear to God, Mark, before I'm 25 I'm

gonna make those guys kiss my ass and

then cry like girls, There will be

retribution for Plaxo and I'm not just

talking. I brought down the record

Okay. For instance, we wanted Baylor in

Texas but Baylor already had a social

network on campus so instead of going

right after them, we made a list of every

school within a hundred miles and put

theFacebook on those campuses first.

Pretty soon all the Baylor kids were

seeing their friends on our site and we

were in.

Perfect.

Thank you, it was mine.

Easy.

Settle an argument for us, would you? I

say it's time to start making money from

theFacebook but Mark doesn't want

advertising. Who's right?

Neither of you. TheFacebook is cool,

that's what it's got going for it.

Yes.

You don't want to ruin it with ads

because ads aren't cool.

Exactly.

it's like you're throwing the coolest

party on campus and someone's telling you

it's gotta be over at 11:00.

MARY,

Exactly.

You don't even know what the thing is

I said exactly that.

Row big it can get and how far it can go.

Picture sharing, news feeds, a virtual

champagne room, apps you haven't even

thought of. This.is no time to take your

chips down. A million dollars isn't cool.

You know what's cool?

You?

A billion dollars. And that's where

you're headed. A billion dollar

valuation. Unless you take bad advice in

which case you might as well have come up

with a chain of very successful dry

cleaners. When you go fishing you can

catch a lot of fish or you can catch a

No, he came to hook an 800 pound marlin

gathered in one of the classrooms.

EDUARDO walks down to the classroom, opens the door and walks

INT. CLASSROOM - NIGHT

--where'60 or so STUDENTS are in a semi-circle, five and six

deep, cheering on the contestants for the internship.

All the desks in the room have been moved to the sides and

five desks with laptops set up in the middle. Next to each

laptop is a shot glass filled with Jack Daniels.

113,

DUSTIN'S holding a. watch and MARK is walking slowly back and

forth behind the five "interviewees" who are intensely typing

at their keyboards.

EDUARDO slowly makes his way through the crowd to MARK. He can

see that on the computer screens are a whole lot of numbers

and letters that neither he nor we can understand.

He stands next to MARK and watches this for a moment. Every

once in a while, one of the contestants will throw back their

shot of Jack Daniels which will instantly get re-filled by a

PRETTY ASIAN GIRL. Throughout all this the CHEERING CONTINUES.

Mark?

MARY,

Yeah.

They're hacking.

All behind a Pix Firewall Emulator. But

here's the beauty.

You know I didn't understand what you

just said, right?

I do know that.

What's the beauty?

Every 10th line of code written, they

have to drink a shot. And hacking's

supposed to be stealth, so anytime the

server detects an intrusion, the

candidate responsible has to drink a

shot. I also have a program running that

has a pop-up window appear simultaneously

on all five computers--the last candidate

to hit the window has to drink a shot.

Plus every three minutes they all have to

drink a shot.

114,

Three minutes.

All five candidates drain their shot glasses and slam them

down where they get re-filled by the pretty Asian girl.

Can I ask--what part of the interns' jobs

will they need to be able to do drunk?

You're right. A more relevant test would

be seeing if they can keep a chicken

alive for a week.

what I just said was mean and I'm sorry.

Are we alright? We started this as a

team.

EDUARDO hands MARK a thick envelope---

it to California for the summer, why did

you turn around and put $18,000 in an

EXT. PALO ALTO HOUSE - DAY

MARK is standing on the roof of this small, campus-area house

as LOUD MUSIC plays. A zii12'line is tied from the chimney and

runs down over a small swimming pool where it's attached to a

telephone pole on the other side.

MARK grabs onto the handle that's connected to the zip line

and flies out over the pool, jumping in with a splash and

cheers from DUSTIN and the INTERNS who are waiting their turns

on the roof.

DUSTIN pulls the handle back up with_a rope that's been

rigged, grabs the handle, takes off and jumps into the pool-to

similar cheers.

The handle gets pulled back on a rope, an INTERN grabs it,

--and the brick chimney comes crashing down.

The INTERN drops into patio furniture as bricks from the

chimney come cascading down.

Shit!/Are you alright?!/ Jesus!/etc-

I'm okay.

You sure?

Yeah.

Is anything broken?

No.

And at that moment a stray brick drops from the roof and

crashes through a glass patio table.

That's gonna out into the security

deposit.

That's the doorbell.

I didn't know we had a doorbell.

Andrew! Get the door!

He's wired in.

MARK walks into--

INT. PALO ALTO HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

The place is computer geek paradise. Computers are everywhere,

along with some of the empty boxes they came in. Pizza boxes,

Chinese food containers, empty beer bottles and white boards

filled with indecipherable code fill the room. There are a

couple of large mattresses on the floor and a large map of the

U.S. with pins and tags showing the schools where they've

already put Facebook and different pins showing the schools

they're going for.

As MARK walks to the door, he walks past ANDREW, who's sitting

at a computer, writing code and completely oblivious to

everything around him.

(snapping his fingers)

Andrew.

Not now.

Good boy.

MARK gets to the door and opens it.

He's stunned to see SEAN PARKER standing there with his

girlfriend, SHARON.

They all look at each other for a moment---

Mark?

Sean?

Do you live here?

118.

Yeah. Do you?

We were right across the street, we saw

the chimney come--

Yeah.

Is anybody hurt?

No. You live across the street.

I'm Sharon.

This is my girlfriend, Sharon. She lives

across the street and I was helping her

move out when we saw the chimney--

Yeah, we had a zip line to the pool.

You came to California.

Yeah.

You made the right choice.

INT. PALO ALTO HOUSE - LATER

SEA,'s looking around the place. DUSTIN and the INTERNS are

standing off to the side, happy to be in the presenbe of Sean

Parker. ANDREW'S still locked into his computer. MARK's off in

the kitchen.

Here you go.

A beer comes flying out of the kitchen and SEAN catches it.

MARK (OS) (CONT'D)

Sharon.

Another beer comes flying out which SHARON had no idea was

coming and so it smashes into the fireplace.

119.

Oh God. I'm so sorry.

And a brick comes down the chimney and crashes on top of the

broken glass from the beer bottle.

You know, ironically, we're paying an

extra 50 bucks a month 'cause it has a

working fireplace.

This house is great. The team is great.

It's exactly what it should be.

I'm Sean Parker.

MARK comes out of the kitchen--

He's wired in.

That's what I'm talkin' about. Where's

Eduardo?

He's got an internship in New York.

Eduardo didn't come out?

EXT. RUBY SKYE - NIGHT

An ultra-hip San Prancisco nightclub where a line of well-

dressed young people stretches from the clipboard holding

BOUNCER down the block. The BOUNCER motions to three SEXY

GIRLS who are let in through the velvet rope. If this reminds

us of the scene at the final club party at the beginning of

this story than that's fine.

The three SEXY GIRLS take us into

INT. RUBY SKYE - CONTINUOUS

It's a hundred-year old theater that's been converted into a

21st Century hot spot for Silicon Valley's rock stars. The

lower level is a giant dance floor packed"with sweating 20-

somethings bouncing to pounding house music. There are raised

blocks where scantily dressed professional. dancers perform non-

stop. A huge lighting grid hangs from the ceiling shooting

colored lights and lasers everywhere. Also hanging from the

ceiling are two trapeze bars with two performers swinging and

contorting.

120,

A WAITRESS holding a tray of colored drinks high over her head

takes us through the crowd to a spiral staircase that's being

guarded by two more BOUNCERS with clipboards. The staircase

leads up to the 2nd level which is all VIP tables that look

out over the dance floor. Each VIP area has a couple of

couches and a table covered in bottles of vodka, tequila, rum,

mixers, ice, glasses and a private waitress who's happy to

bend over and pour a drink for you,

And that's where we catch up with MARK and SEAN. Sitting next

to SEAN is a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN and there's another standing

behind him and leaning against the couch.

MARK and SEAN have to speak the music.

I still can't believe I rented a house

across the street from you.

That's not my house. It was Sharon's. I

was crashing there for a little. bit while

I'm taking care of some things. But she's

done for the summer so she's back at her

parents' place and I'm homeless.

Yeah?

You can crash at our. place for a few days

if you want.

That's sol..id man, thanks,

I'm going to the ladies' room;

You got it.

I'll go with you.

The two girls exit--

Your date looks so familiar to me,

She looks familiar to a lot of people.

What do you mean?

].21.

Look at any Victoria's Secret catalogue

from the last six months.

. MARK

You're kidding.

No man. I'll tell you something, you know

how I founded Napster?

I know everything there is to know about

you Sean.

Fuck Wikipedia, Mark, no you don't.

I was going out with this girl in high

school. And it was great. I thought it

was great, but the whole time--almost the

.whole time we were together., like five

months--she was giving blow. jobs to the

co-captain of the lacrosse team. And I

found out and I was willing to forgive

her but she told me she loved him. So I

had this dream that I would make a

billion dollar company.. Not a million

dollar company--any hack can do that---a

billion dollar company. And I would have

business cards printed up that said, "I'm

CEO.. .Bitch. "

It's our time. We run the universe. Yeah,

she's a Victoria's Secret model. I want

to know where the fuck Eduardo is.

He has an internship.

An internship?

In New York.

The company's here. A billion dollar

company is here. And what confuses me is

that in New York, Eduardo introduced

himself as the business head of Facebook.

I've been at the front of two of the

biggest things in the history of the

internet and I can tell you that nothing,

nothing is more important to a start-up

than the energy and ambition of its

founders.

122.

You have to live and breathe the project

every minute of every day and-night. Do

you live and breathe Facebook?

Yes.

I know you do. I know those guys back at

the house do. The guy's eyes did not

blink when a beer bottle smashed into a

fireplace 10 feet from his work, station.

So I'll ask again--where's Eduar

It'd be great if you stayed at the house

with us.

I think I should.

The girls come back--

You guys figure out a new way to get porn

on your computer?

You know most of it's bad but some of

it's pretty good.

MARK and SEAN aren't paying attention...

What's your goal for the summer?

We want: to . be in a hundred schools.

okay. Okay good. I'll tell you what.

Gesture of good faith. While you're

getting yourself into a hundred schools,

I'm gonna put you on two continents.

What?

Let's line up some shots.

(to the WAITRESS)

Don Julio 1942.

123.

Absolutely, Mr. Parker.

The WAITRESS goes off--

Mark?

Yeah.

I never told her my name.

EXT. THE THAMES -- DAY

we're looking at a stone bridge crossing a perfectly straight

stretch of water against the backdrop of the medieval town of

Henley, England--founded in 1179.

And after a moment of placid quiet--

Two razor thin skulls explode out from under the bridge for

the final, agonizing hundred-meter stretch of the ancient and

prestigious Henley Royal Regatta.

The two boats are neck and neck coming out of the bridge. The

port-side boat is being crewed by the two Dutch members of the

Ilollandia Roeiclub. The starboard boat is being crewed by a

pair of identical twins wearing tank tops bearing the "H" of

Harvard.

We HEAR the ROAR come up from the CROWD in the viewing

section. The crowd is dressed as if for opening day at Ascot

-- the women in flowing dresses and wide-brimmed hats, the men i n

blazers and brightly colored floral ties.

But the young men in the boats can barely hear the crowd. Just

their own breathing as they pull against the longest natural.

straight stretch of water in the world--a mile and a half

torture test against the best competition they've ever faced.

And they're neck and neck. CAMERON and TYLER can't shake the

Dutch.

The CROWD is going crazy in their own English way as none of

them can remember ever seeing two boats this close this late.

Mixed in with the British crowd is a small contingent waving

the flag of Holland and a slightly larger contingent of

Americans.

124.

We'll notice a stoic man in a VIP viewing section and latex

we'll be introduced to him as Cameron and Tyler's father, Next

to him is their mother, who can barely watch.

Back on the boats it's just the breathing as the skulls slice

through the water like jet-powered knives. 50 meters now and

there's still no daylight between them.

We see a small trickle of blood from CAMERON's left hand begin

to stream down his arm.

25 meters and the Dutch and American fans are going crazy--

even the British aristocracy can't help but get caught ups

the closest race in the history of the competition. The 'ATH_PT'i12

is silently willing his boys one more fraction of boat speed--

the MOTHER has her hands over her mouth in praying position.

The blood that's covering CAMERON's left arm is being diluted

by the sweat that's pouring down from his triceps as they dig,

and pull, and pull, and pull, and---

POP!

--the finish gun is fired into the air, the oars come out of

the water and the bodies of the crewmen slump over.

CAMERON turns his head to the cheering crowd to see the Dutch

group holding a giant flag and.jumping up and down. The

Americans bring their giant flag down and fold it up.

The two DUTCH CREW. MEMBERS pump their fists in the air and hug

as the two boats skim along to a gentle stop.

The MOTHER drops her head-and looks down. The FATHER refuses

to look away.

From CAMERON and TYLER, just the'breathing.,

EXT. AWARD CEREMONY - DAY

CAMERON and TYLER are standing with their coaches and next to

the two DUTCH CREWMEN who are with their coaches. They're on a

stand in the Steward's Enclosure, a sprawling and glamorous

tented area for the exclusive use of members and their guests.

After a moment, a man in a double breasted navy blazer steps

out with his retinue in tow. The man is PRINCE ALBERT of

Monaco. He receives a healthy clapping of golf applause as he

approaches the stand.

This conversation is done without microphones or anything as

modern as that.

125.

His Royal Highness, Prince Albert. Sir,

may I present Mr. Cameron Winklevoss and

Mr. Tyler. Winklevoss of Harvard

University.

Brilliant race. Never seen a race that

close. Less than one second, the steward

tells me.

Yes, Your Highness.

My grandfather, Jack Kelly, was one of

the premiere rowers of his day. I've been

coming to Henley for 30 years. Never seen

a race that close. Have you? Have you

seen a race that close?

CAMERON is thinking about starting a war with Monaco right now

so he lets his brother do the talking.

No, Your Highness. Mile and a half races

are more commonly won by a boat length or

two.

Yes, that's absolutely right. Less than a

second though in your case. Well as they

say, I suppose it just came down to who

wanted it more.

Oh what a bullshit cliche: You think we

Cam.

There's an awkward silence for a moment...

Will I have the pleasure of watching you

both row again in Beijing?

If we make the team, sir, yes. Thank you.

I present you with your Second Place

ribbons. On to the champions!

126,

And off the APPLAUSE from the crowd, we

INT./EXT. STEWARD'S TENT - DAY

The regatta party is underway. Music, drinks, uniformed

waiters, blazers and hats everywhere.

TYLER and CAMERON have changed into their Harvard. blazers and

are joined now by DIVYA. The three of them have tried to find

an unpopulated spot. TYLER and DIVYA have glasses of beer and

are standing but CAMERON's sitting at a table with a laptop

open and watching film of the end of the race.

Hitting reverse on the computer and watching, over and over

again, the bow of the Dutch boat pull ahead by six inches at

just the right moment.

Yeah. We didn't want it enough. That was

the problem. Fuck you, you fucking little--

Casa. The guy' s the prince of a country

the size of East Hampton. Let it go.

MR. WINKLEVOSS has made his way over...

MR. WINKLEVOSS

Boys.

Dad.

MR. WINKLEVOSS

Divya.

How are-you, Mr. Winklevoss.

MR. WINKLEVOSS

That was a tough beat. A tough beat.

I'm sorry, dad. You and mom flew all the

way over.

MR. WINKLEVOSS

Listen to me good, you two. Don't you

ever apologize to me for losing a race

like that. Don't you ever apologize to

anyone for losing a race like that.

Another man comes along, MR. KENWRIGHT.

127.

-Boys.

Oh. Mr. Kenwright. Dad, this is Mr.

Kenwright, part of our host family this

week.

Pleasure to meet you.

MR. WINKLEVOSS

Good to meet you.

I just had the most extraordinary phone

chat with my daughter. She told me that

she and her friends are all talking about

the race, which ended just, a half-hour

ago, via their computers. A new website

called Facebook. Do you have this in

America?

Eve.ryon= is frozen...

Your daughter doesn't go to school in the

U.S.?

No no. Cambridge. Majoring in French

Literature, though I wasn't aware there

was such a thing.

They have Facebook at Cambridge?

And Oxford, St. Andrews, Warwick and the

London School of Economics best as I can

tell. because that's where her friends

are.

MR. WINKLEVOSS

I'm going to find your mother.

Good race, boys. Live to fight another

day.

Thank you.

The men leave and CAMERON, TYLER and DIVYA are alone. CAMERON

looks at them for a moment, then turns back to watching the

128.

Turn it off.

Turn it off, Cam. Look at me.

CAMERON turns to his brother...

I don't mind that we got beat by the

Dutch by less than a second. That was a

fair race, that was a good race and they

had the better boat today and they'll see

us again. What I mind is that we got beat

by Mark Zuckerberg...by less than a

second.

We tried the Ad Board, we tried the

president of the University and we tried

talking to him ourselves. Now I'm asking

you. For the one-hundreth time. Let's

take the considerable-resources at our

disposal and sue him in a federal. court.

CAMERON looks at his brother...then turns back to the

computer. He watches the Dutch boat pull ahead at the last

moment. TYLER and DIVYA are just about to give up when CAMERON

swings back and says--

Let's fucking gut that little nerd.

(jamming his fists in the air)

Finally!

INT. PALO ALTO HOUSE - NIGHT

There's a thunderstorm going on outside and rain is beating

hard against the windows, DUSTIN, ANDREW-and the INTERNS are

hard at work writing code. Green Day is pumping from the

speakers.

SEAN is pacing the house on his cell phone while two YOUNG

WOMEN--dressed to go out for a party--are at the moment each

on a free computer playing each other in a game of Counter-

Strike. Basically they're shooting at each other and missing

and laughing their heads off,

it wouldn't appear as if the house has been cleaned since the

last time we saw it and in fact there are signs of more

wreckage as well as futons, pillows and blankets on the floor.

But check it out, I saw him today.

129,

Moritz, Michael Moritz, my Sequoia

Capital---hang on.

(to the girls)

Are you guys using Wallhacks or Aimbots?

we don't know, we're just shooting at

each other.

The DOORBELL RINGS but no one pays attention--

Use Barr cks.

Like we know what that is.

Now there's a KNOCKING at the door and we

with a suitcase in his hand. A taxi is turning around in the

driveway and heading off. EDUARDO knocks on the front door

again as we

CUT BACK TO.

INT. PALO ALTO HOUSE - NIGHT

I saw him getting into his car and he saw

me too, I know he did.

A Porsche Carrera 911 Turbo. Hang on.

SEAN leans over one of the girls, casually hits a few keys and

easily kills several of the other girl's soldiers.

Yes!

Hey!

Bong hit.

Anybody hear that banging?

While the following is going on, here's what's happening: The

girls have gone over to a 12-foot bong that starts at the

floor and goes to the landing at the top of the stairs.

130,

it gets lit at the bottom and smoked at the top so the girl

who just got her soldiers hit trots up the stairs.

You don't hear anything, you're supposed

to be writing code.

Dude, somebody's at the door.

SEAN goes back to the cell phone conversation as he heads to

The guy hires a P.T, to follow me around.

Who does that in real life? Michael

Moritz and I are gonna meet in a dark

alley, I'll take Sequoia Capital down

with him.

SEAN opens the door and the soaking wet EDUARDO is standing

there...

What the hell.

I'll call you back

What's up?

What's up?

Mark was supposed to get me at the

airport two hours ago, I've been calling

his cell.

He was on a 36 hour coding tear so he

took a nap for a couple of hours.

EDUARDO walks into the house and surveys the wreckage--

What in hell happened here?

Not happened--happening. The next big

thing.

Wardo!

131.

Hey man.

Back to work.

The girl at the bottom of the stairs has filled the bowl and

lights a lighter--

GIRT, #1

You ready?

Go.

EDUARDO watches as the girl at the top of the stairs takes a

12-foot hit from the tower-bong.

Flow old are they, Sean?

It's not polite to ask,

How old are they?

You think you know me, don't you.

I've read enough.

You know how much I've read about you?

Nothing.

MARK comes down the stairs--

Wardo.

I waited an hour for you at the airport.

What time is it?

It's midnight. Or 3AM in New York where I

just came from.

You've gotta see some of the new stuff

we've got. Dustin, show him the wall. I'm

just calling it the wall.

132.

Forget the wall, tell him about the

meeting I've got set up with Peter Thiel.

You know Peter Thiel?

No.

Why would you? He just runs a two-billion

dollar hedge fund called Clarium Capital

and was the money behind PayPal.

Why's he setting up meetings?

Thiel may want to make an angel,

investment.

I don't care if he's an actual angel,

why's he setting up business meetings?

You've had a long flight.

No, I've had a long wait on the tarmac at

JFK, theft a long wait at the passenger

loading and unloading zone at SFO and in

between there was a long flight. I run

the business end of this company, he's a

house guest living rent-free on a

generous grant from the Eduardo Saverin

Foundation.'

How's the business end going? I see you

got some big ticket ad buys lined up.

The Harvard Eartendi.ng Course, the Seneca

Club's Red Party and the Mather House

annual "Lather Dance". You're just one

small step away from bagging Snookies

Cookies, I can feel it.

Can I talk to you alone for a minute?

133.

Sure.

Bong hit!

I'm pretty baked.

Don't worry about it, it's just from the

How's it going? How's the internship?

How's Jenny?

How's the internship?

Yeah.

Mark.. .Jesus, I quit the internship.

We've talked about this on the phone,

were you even--I quit on my first day.

I do remember you saying that.

Yeah, it was a pretty big deal.

How's Jenny?

Jenny's psycho.

That can be fun.

No I mean she's actually psychotic. She's

insanely jealous and she's irrational and

she's violent.

Still, it's nice you have a girlfriend.

134 ,

I do not want that guy representing

himself as part of this company.

You gotta move out here, Wardo, this is

where it's all happening.

Did you hear what I just said?

The con etions, the energy-

--the creativity.

He's not part of the company.

We've got over 300,000 members, we're in

I'm aware of that.

We're in the offices of a guy who's hero is Gordon Gekko. MARK

SEAN's wearing his best Prada, MARK's wearing his hoodie and

Adidas flip-flops.

That's comforting.

When did you get back?

You scared me. I need you to knock first.

When did you get back?

I got back this afternoon.

And when were you going to call me?

Jen, it was kind of a rough trip and I

was tired and--

Or answer one of my 47 texts? Did you

know I sent 47 texts?

I did, and I thought that was incredibly

normal behavior.

Are you mocking me?

I brought you a present.

Why does your status say "single" on your

Facebook page?

What?

Why does your relationship status say

"single" on your k'acebook page?

I was single when I set up the page.

And you just never bothered to change it?

What?!

I don't know how.

Do I look stupid to you?

No. Calm down.

138,

You're asking me to believe that the CFO

of Facebook doesn't know how to-change

his relationship status on Facebook?

It's a little embarrassing so you should

take it as a sign of trust that I would

tell you that.

Puck you, Wardo.

Easy.

You didn't change it so you could fuck

Silicon valley skanks every time you go

out to see Mark.

That is not even remotely true and I can

promise you that the Silicon valley

skanks don't care what anyone's

relationship status is on Facebook.

Please let me give you your present.

EDUARDO's cell phone RINGS--

Oh, your phone does work.

EDUARDO reaches for his cell but JENNY grabs it first to check

the ID.

It's Mark.

JENNY tosses the still ringing phone back to him--

Okay, this is gonna be tricky. Here, open

your present. It's a silk scarf.

Have you ever seen me wear a scarf?

This'll be your first.

EDUARDO's gotten the gift box out of his half un-packed

suitcase, tossed it to JENNY and finally answered the phone.

139.

Yeah.

INT. PALO ALTO HOUSE - SAME TIME

(into his cell phone)

You froze our account?

in the background there's a small celebration going on with

SEAN, DUSTIN, the INTERNS and of course some GIRLS. Champagne

is being sprayed from shaken bottles and the girls. are dancing

to triumphant music.

I did.

You froze the account.

I had to get your attention, mark.

Do you realize that you jeopardized the

entire company? Do you realize that your

actions could have easily destroyed

everything I've been working on?

We've been working on.

Without money, the company can't

function.

What EDUARDO can't see behind his back is that JENNY has taken

the gift box and lit it on fire with a cigarette lighter.

If the servers are down for even a day,

our reputation is damaged irreversibly,.

Users are fickle. Friendster has proven

that fact.

And JENNY's now dropped the flaming cardboard box into the

wastebasket where the fire grows larger. She casually kicks

the basket over with her foot.

140,

Even a small exodus, even a few people

leaving would reverberate through the

whole user base. The users are

interconnected, that's the whole fucking

point! College kids are online because

their friends are online and if one

being nobody?! Did you like being a pasty-

faced geek?! You wanna go back to that?!

I'm putting you on speaker.

EDUARDO hits a button on his cell and tosses it down. We'll.

keep hearing MARK'savoice as EDUARDO runs out into the

hallway, grabs a fire extinguisher from its wall bracket,

comes back in and sprays out the fire.

That was the act'of a child, not a

businessman. And it certainly wasn't the

act of a friend, You know how embarrassed

I was when I tried to cash a check? And I

was with a girl, Wardo. It happened in

front of a girl. I'm not going back to

that life,

Yeah!

Okay, maybe you were angry, maybe you

were frustrated. I'm ready to let, uh, to

let bygones be bygones because I've got

some good news.

EDUARDO--with the fire now out--picks up the phone.

I'm sorry. It .maybe was angry and it was

childish. I needed to get your attention.

].41 .

I said I've got some good news.

What is it?

Peter Thiel's just made an angel

investment of a half a million dollars..

What?

A half a million dollars and he's setting

us up in an office. They want to re-

incorporate the company, they want to

meet you and they need your signature on

some documents so get your ass on the

next flight back to San Francisco. I need

my CFO,

I'm on my way.

EDUARDO clicks the phone shut.

You're going back there?

Yes. Also I'm breaking up with you.

high floor of a high rise.

Cartons are being unpacked, computers are everywhere along

with bags of potato chips and boxes of cereal.

In the conference room, EDUARDO is sitting with three LAWYERS

at a round, glass table and documents have been put out in

front of him.

1.42.

We can see through the glass that MARY, is working at a

computer nearby. SEAN is also hovering in the background.

Four documents, These two are common

stock purchase agreements allowing you to

buy stock in the newly re-incorporated

Facebook instead of the old stock which

is now worthless, The third is the

exchange agreement, that's for exchanging

your old shares for new shares and this

is the voter holding agreement.

How many shares of stock will I own?

1,328,334.

Jesus Christ.

That's a 34.4% ownership share. Why the

rise from the original 30%?

Because you may need to dilute it to

award shares to new investors.

I like dealing with business majors.

You should know that Mark's already taken

his percentage from 60 down to 51.

Mark doesn't care about money and he

needs to be protected.

Dustin Moskowitz owns 6.81%, Sean Parker

I can live with that.

And Peter Theil 7%. Would you like to use

my pen?

INT. FIRST DEPOSITION ROOM EVENING

It's dusk now and the sky outside the room is turning purple.

EDUARDO seems lost in thought.

Eduardo?

EDUARDO looks up.

I'm sorry. Could you please repeat the

question?

Counsel: "And when you signed these

documents, were you aware that you were

signing your own death certificate?"

No.

It was insanely stupid of me not to have

my own lawyer look over all the-the,

uh.. .I thought they were my lawyers.

I was a Harvard business major.

(then to MARK)

I was your only friend. You had one

friend.

My father won't look at me.

Okay. Eduardo? Did Mr. Zuckerberg saying

anything to you after you signed the

papers?

Well there was a lot of handshaking and

congratulations. He'd already told me he

wouldn't be coming back to school for at

least a semester so we were saying

goodbye for a while. And then before I

left, he said----

INT. rACE000K OFFICE -a DAY

But you gotta come back. Somewhere around

the end of November/early December.

144,

Peter's gonna throw us an amazing party

when we hit a million members, it's gonna

be out of control. You've gotta come back

for it.

(quietly can't believe it)

A million members.

Yeah.

Remember the algorithm on the window at

Kirkland?

Yeah.

Yeah, I'll be here.

EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREET - DAY

A brand new black Escalade pulls up in front of a gleaming

glass and chrome office building.. SEAN is at the wheel and

MARK, in the passenger seat, is wearing brightly colored

pajamas with his hair a mess.

They get out of the car and huddle-on the sidewalk.

You sure about-this?

Oh yes. You're 20 minutes late. You're

going to walk in there and say you

overslept. and you didn't have time to get

dressed, They're gonna pitch you, Sequoia

Capital is gonna pitch you. They're gonna

.tell you why you should take their money.

They're gonna beg you to take their

money, You're gonna nod, you're gonna

nod, you're. gonna nod and then you're

-gonna say, "Which one of you is Michael

Moritz?". Moritz is gonna say, "That's

me". And you're gonna say, "Sean Parker

says 'Fuck you.' And walk right on out.

Okay.

MARK heads into the office building.

145.

SEAN looks up to the windows of a high floor, points, and says--

Fuck. You.

INT. FIRST DEPOSITION ROOM - EVENING

In late November I got the e-mail from

Mark telling me to come out for the

millionth member party.

What else did the e-mail say?

It said that we had to have a business

meeting. That Mark and Sean had played

some kind of revenge stunt on Michael

Moritz and Sequoia capital. and that it

had impressed Moritz so much that he was

making an investment offer that was hard

to turn down.

INT. NEW FACEBOOE OFFICES - NIGHT

I went out to California and went

straight to the new offices.

And it's clear that we're in the offices of a new, high-tech,

very successful internet company. The Facebook logo in blue

metallic letters on the wall, the maple desks, new computer

monitors, carpeting, a wall covered in graffiti by an artist

commissioned for. the job and -tons of young employees.

EDUARDO (V.0.) (CONT'D)

I didn't know whether to dress for the

party or the business meeting so I kind

of dressed for both.

We see that most of the employees, especially the women, are

dressed to go to an after-work, late-night party.

EDUARDO (V.0.) (CONT'D)

But it didn't matter.

GRETCHEN (V.O.)

Why not?

146.

EDUARDO (V.0.)

Because I wasn't called out there for

either one.

INT. FIRST DEPOSITION-ROOM - EVENING

GRETCHEN (V.O.)

What were you called out there for?

EDUARDO (V.0.)

An ambush.

LAWYER (V.0.)

Eduardo'.

CUT BACK TO:

INT. NEW FACEBOOK OFFICES - NIGHT

Eduardo.

EDUARDO turns to see the LAWYER he dealt with earlier standing

by the door to a glass conference room.

In here.

EDUARDO walks across the bullpen; where no one makes eye

contact, and into--

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM -CONTINUOUS

EDUARDO (V.0.)

At first I thought he was joking, giving

me more contracts to sign. But then I

started reading.

As EDUARDO reads, we rack focus to MARK, who's sitting at a

computer'with his back to EDUARDO, focused on his work.

And then we see-SEAN step into the frame and lean against a

desk a few yards away.

And then back to EDUARDO, who's almost shaking...

What is this?

What is this?

If you'll let me--

EDUARDO goes back out into--

INT. BULLPEN - CONTINUOUS

Mark?

MARK doesn't look up from his computer--

Mark.

MARK still doesn't look up--

He's wired in.

I'm sorry?

He's wired in.

Is he?

Yes.

EDUARDO picks up MARK's laptop over his head and smashes it

down on the desk, breaking it into pieces.

How 'bout now, are you still wired in?

(to the girl at the desk he's

Call security.

Everyone in the office is frozen, silent and watching.

You issued over 24-million new shares of

stock.

You were told that if new investors came

How much were your shares diluted? How

INT. FIRST DEPOSITION ROOM - EVENING

What was Mr. Zuckerberg's ownership share

diluted down to?

It wa i12

What was Mr. Moskowitz's ownership share

diluted down to?

It wasn't.

What was Sean Parker's ownership share

diluted down to?

It wasn't.

What was Peter Thief's ownership share

diluted down. to?

It wasn't.

What was your ownership share diluted

down to?

Point-zero-three percent.

INT. NEW FACEBOOK OFFICES - NIGHT

You signed the papers.

You set me up.

1. 49.

You're gonna blame me because you were

the business head of the company and you

made a bad business deal with your own

company?!

It's gonna be like I'm not part of

Facebook.

It's not. gonna be like you're not part of

Facebook, you're not part of Facebook.

My name's on the masthead.

Check again.

EDUARDO is momentarily frozen...

This is because I froze the account?

You think we were gonna let you parade

around in your ridiculous suits

pretending you were running this company?

Sorry, but my Prada's at the cleaners

along with my hoodie and my fuck-you flip-

flops you pretentious douchebag.

Oooh, security is here. You'll be leaving

now.

Two SECURITY GUARDS have come in--

:I'm not signing those papers.

We'll get your signature.

(turning to MARK)

Tell me this isn't about me getting into

the Phoenix.

That's right. It is. Maybe if you'd spent

a little less time with your new friends

and a little more time with the company

150.

You did it. I always knew you did it. You

planted the story about the chicken.

What the fuck is he talking about?

I didn't.

You had me accused of animal cruelty.

Seriously, what the fuck is up with the

chicken?

And I'll bet you just hated that they

identified me as a co-founder of Facebook-

-which I am! You better lawyer-up,

asshole, 'cause I'm not comin' for my 30

percent, I'm comin' after everythin g

Get him outa here.

I'm going.

Hang on.

SEAN hands EDUARDO aafolded check.

There's your $19,000. 1 wouldn't cash it,

though, I drew it on the account you

froze.

EDUARDO looks. at SEAN. . .then suddenly and quickly cocks his

fist back to punch him in the face. SEAN flinches as EDUARDO

holds his punch and lets out a small laugh.

I like standing next to you, Sean. It

makes me look tough in comparison.

EDUARDO exits with the security escort.

There's a long silence in the room...

151.

That's it. That's our show for tonight. I

want to see everybody here get geared up

for a party. We're gonna walk down to the

club like it's the Macy's Thanksgiving

Parade. Mackey, put it up on the screen,

we've gotta be almost there.

A young employee hits a remote and a few keys on his computer

and a huge flat-screen displays a Facebook page with a read-

out of the number of members.

999,982

There's scattered applause and excitement as everyone watches.

SEAN takes MARK aside.

You alright?

Yeah.

You were kinda rough on him.

That's life in the NFL.

No. You didn't have to be that rough on

him.

Listen, I'm putting together a party-.-

Sean? You didn't have to be that rough on

him.

I get it. I'll send flowers. I'm putting

-together a party after the party at Gamma

Phi Beta. Ashleigh over there's a sister

and she says her friends are all down..

Ashleigh?

Yeah.

That's great. I've been, you know, I've

been talking to her a little. I don't

know, I think she likes me.

152,

Oh dude.

What?

Yeah.

An intern, ASHLEIGH, comes along With a small package--

Excuse me, Mark?

SEAN.

We were just talkin' about you,Ash.

We're on for tonight?

Yeah.

This came in for you.

You can put it on my desk.

ASHLEIGH puts the small package on Mark's desk.

She's 19, I can't he.lp it, But I'll tell

you what--after tonight.she's yours. in

fact, I'm. gonna get' you in with all sorts

of girls you wouldn't have met before.

Mackey!

Yes sir!

Refresh!

(blandly to SEAN)

You'd do that for me?

MACKEY hits the "refresh" key and the big screen shows--

1,000,002

CHEERS erupts throughout the place. SEAN grabs MARK and hugs

him but MARK doesn't quite hug back--he's still hearing what

SEAN just said.

153.

EXT. SORORITY HOUSE - NIGHT

We can hear the thumping music coming 'from the party inside

and college kids have spilled out onto the front lawn of this

pristine, four-columned house.

INT. SORORITY HOUSE - NIGHT

It's dark but we can make out people dancing. The place is

packed.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

We hear the thumping music from the party. SEAN's in there

with a couple of guys, ASHLEIGH and another GIRL. SEAN's got

his cell phone out and will snap a picture every once in a

while.

I can't find a mirror.

Do it on anything. You can use a CD.

Do it off this.

ASHLEIGH's sat on the bed and unbuttoned her top so that she's

in just a bra. She's offering her chest as a surface off of

which to snort cocaine.

Alright!

The GIRL taps out some coke from a vial onto ASHLEIGH's chest

and starts passing around a rolled up 20-dollar bill for

everyone to have a turn and she herself will unbutton her

shirt too for the same purpose. All this while SEAN is

talking,

The next transformative development? A

picture sharing application. A place

where you view pictures that coincide

with your social life. It is the

true... digitalization of real life. You

don't just go to a party anymore, you go

to a party with your digital camera and

your friends relive the party on

Facebook. And tagging. The idea that you

could tag anyone you wanted in those

pictures so that people could find

themselves. Then a digital log of every

change in a person's life, broadcast to

all their friends instantaneously.

154,

Would this be easier without the bra?

It's worth finding out.

The girls start happily slipping off their bras--

.SEAN

I've spent hours--

Why has the music stopped?

I've spent hours watching what people do

when they log on.

Seriously, why has the music stopped?

ASHLEIGH has a point. The music stopped in the addle of

SEAN's speech and the sound outside from the party just

doesn't sound like a party anymore.

flow they always checked their friends'

status updates, checked to see which of

their friends had changed their profiles,

changed their photos and mostly...We

lived on farms, then we lived in cities

and now we're gonna live on the internet.

Sean. Stop. Something's going on

downstairs,

SEAN stops talking-he senses it too now.

SEAN walks out of the room to the--

INT, STAIRCASE LANDING - CONTINUOUS

And out the window he sees a fleet of police cars with their

lights flashing parked in front of the house. Then before he

can react, the front door flies open--

POLICE with flashlights walk in--the beams of light streaking

across the darkened party floor and the faces..

We HEAR muffled murmurs from the cops of "party's over" and

"step to the side" and "nobody's leaving just yet", etc.

SEAN bolts back into--

155.

INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

--leaving the door open.

It's the cops.

And they all spring into action. The girls are putting their

bras back on, SEAN is wiping down a night table with the palm

of his hand to get the coke dust off.

What's goin' on?

They turn to see TWO POLICEMEN standing in the doorway, their

flashlights scanning the room and hitting SEAN's eyes.

We're sorry, was the music too loud?

We've got kind of a celebration going.

Ladies, I need you to put your shirts on.

I can have them turn the music down.

One of the policemen casually takes SEAN's hand and sees that

his palm looks like he just used it to erase a blackboard. The

cop uses his finger to taste what it is.

Yeah, that isn't mine.

Okay, could you all stay where you are.

And the handcuffs start to come out and we've got a room of

terrified children.

GIRL,

Wait, can we just talk for a second?

We start to move in on SEAM...

150.

You got anything in your pockets I need

to know about?

No sir.

Don't be stupid now,

I don It.

(out of SEAN's shirt pocket)

What's this?

It's an Epipen,

And this?

That's my inhaler.

Ladies, how old are you?

I'm 20.

I'm 19,

Lying makes a i_'E worse.

I'm 17, I-'m sorry, I shouldn't have lied.

SEAN closes. his eyes at hearing this news as we HEAR the sound

of the-cuffs lock around his wrists and we

INT. NEW FACEBOOK OFFICES - NIGHT

A digital LED clock on the wall tells us it's 4:40AM.

MARK is sitting at his computer alone. No one else is in the

office. The San Francisco skyline is beautiful outside the

floor-to-ceiling glass.

His cell phone RINGS and he answers.

1. 57.

Hello?

EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

SEAN, freezing with no coat on, is sitting on the bottom of

the steps to the police station.'The LAWYER we've seen before

is standing in back of him.

Listen, something's happened.

We see MARK listening on his end but can't hear SEAN's end of

the conversation.

Shit.

It's alright, it's gonna be alright. I've

posted bond-and I wasn't doing anything.

I mean, I've got allergies so I can't----

We're back on MARK's side. He listens... listens...

17?

Back on SEAN's side-

I think it was Moritz. I swear, I think

it was Michael Moritz.

This is gonna be news, Sean, it's gonna.

be online any second.

I know.

You know with anunderage intern and--

It's cool, I've got it under control.

158,

I'll get it under control. I'll call our

guys and see what the next move is. But

this is gonna be news now.

You think it was Moritz? 'Cause I do. And

I'm gonna meet that guy in a dark alley

one night. Or Eduardo? Did Eduardo have

me followed?

(cool as ice)

Go home, Sean. I'll call our people.

MARK clicks the phone shut. He sits there a moment.

He looks at the small package. that Ashleigh dropped on his

desk earlier. He opens up the brown paper wrapping and there's

a box.

He opens the box--a thousand brand new business cards. He

takes one of the business cards out and looks at it.

I'm CEO ...Bitoh

And over this we HEAR a woman's voice...

MARYLIN (V.0.)

Mark?

INT. FIRST DEPOSITION ROOM - NIGHT

MARK is sitting alone.-in the conference room. The only one

left is MARYL?N,whose voi12.ce we just. heard. The lightp of the

San Francisco skyline fill the huge picture windows.

Mark?

MARK looks up at her...

Everyone's gone,

MARK doesn't say anything...

We're done for the day,

Who would you rather he?

159.

I'm sorry?

My lawyer or their lawyer?

Something tells me over the long run

there's more money in being your lawyer.

What happened to Sean?

He cashed out most of his stock. Hey

listen, all you had all day was that

salad. You want to get something to eat?

I can't.

I'm not a bad guy.

I know that. I like you.

What happens now?

Sy and the rest of them are at the Palm

having a steak. Then they'll come back, up

to the office and start working on a

settlement agreement to present to you.

They're gonna want to settle?

Oh yeah. And you're gonna have to pay

some bonus money too.

Why?

'Cause you're gonna need these guys to

sign a non-disclosure agreement and

you're gonna need to be indemnified. They

say one unflattering word about you in

public and you own their house, wife and

kids.

I invented Facebook.

160.

I'm talking about what a jury'll see.

.That's what I do, that's what I'm doing

here. I'm trying to specialize in voir

dire--jury selection. Clothes, hair,

wedding ring, speaking style, likability--

Likability?

I've been licensed to practice law for

all of-20 months and I could get a jury

to believe you planted the story about

Eduardo. You know how? Just by asking the

question. Watch. Why weren't you at the

sorority party that night?

You think I'm the one who called the

police?

Doesn't matter, I asked the question and

now everybody's thinking about it. You

lost the jury in the first 10 minutes.

Farm animals?

.MARYLIN

Yeah,

I was drunk and angry and stupid.

And blogging.

Pay the fine. Get your parking validated.

Get out of it. That's what Sy and the

guys'll tell you in the morning.

Would anyone mind it I stayed and used

the computer for a minute?

No. There's a night guy downstairs. Stay

as long as you want.

Thanks. I appreciate your help today,

You're not an asshole, Mark. You just

want to be.

161.

MARYI,IN, who's been putting on her coat, takes her briefcase

and exits.

MARK sits down at the computer. He logs on to Facebook.

He -types a name in the-search box: "Erica Albright".

Erica's name and picture come up, along with Boston

University, '07. Mark smiles. She's on Facebook.

He moves the mouse back and forth between two boxes: "Send a

Message." and "Add as a Friend".

He clicks on "Add as a Friend".

A box comes up that reads: "Your request to add Erica Albright

as a friend has been sent."

Then MARK clicks to his homepage and waits for the response.

And waits...

Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss received a settlement of 65

million dollars and signed a non-disclosure agreement,

They rowed for the U.S. Olympic Team in Beijing and placed sixth.

MARK is still waiting...

Eduardo Saverin received an unknown Gash settlement. His name

has been restored to the Facebook masthead as a founder.

MARK is settling into his chair. He'll wait all night if he

has to.

Facebook has 180 million members in 60 countries. It's

currently valued at 15 billion dollars.

Mark zuckerberg is the youngest billionaire in the world.

MARK waits...

And waits...
