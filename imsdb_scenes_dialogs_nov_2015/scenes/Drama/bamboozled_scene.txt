WHITE LETTERS ON BLACK

WE HEAR the VOICE of PIERRE DELACROIX.

INT. APARTMENT - MORNING

WE are in the living quarters of PIERRE DELACROIX.  The

windows overlook the Brooklyn Promenade and the majestic

lower Manhattan skyline.

We see a tall figure move in and around the space.

EXT. TENEMENT - LOWER EAST SIDE - MORNING

The tenement building is boarded up, condemned, bombed out,

but a home, a shelter nonetheless.

INT. TENEMENT - MORNING

People to our surprise live in here.  It is a commune.  The

homeless, people who have been left out, forgot about,

written off, and don't matter.  The fringes of society.

CHEEBA, a skinny Puerto Rican male, tries to wake a

slumbering body under a mass of old newspapers.

The mass begins to move.

INT. CNS TOWER - MORNING

MANRAY, a young African-American dread-lock male, and Cheeba

are getting set up in front of the entrance to the

CONTINENTAL NETWORK SYSTEM building.  CNS is one of the

fledgling, upstart new networks, trying to battle with ABC,

NBC, CBS, FOX, WB, and UPN.

ANGLE ON

Entrance.  Cheeba is putting the portable floor down on the

sidewalk.  Manray sits on the curb, taking the sneakers off

and putting on his tap shoes; bottle caps are on the soles

of the shoes instead of real taps.

Manray takes a small bow.  A few, not many, people have

stopped to look.

CLOSE ON

Manray, who starts to do his thing, and when he starts doing

his thing attention must be paid.

ANGLE ON

Crowd, as Manray gets busy, people gather to watch.

ANGLE ON

Delacroix, he is about to walk into the CNS building but

stops to check out Manray.

CLOSE ON

Manray, he pounds out some intricate steps and freezes at

the end of the move.

ANGLE ON

Crowd, who applaud as Cheeba unfolds a brown shopping bag

and holds it out in front of them.

People are digging into their pockets.

A WOMAN is about to dump some change in the brown paper bag.

Cheeba looks at her and she quickly pulls out a 5-spot from

her purse and drops it into the bag.

Cheeba works his way over to Delacroix.

Delacroix hands Cheeba a ten dollar bill.

Delacroix moves towards the revolving doors of CNS.

INT. ELEVATOR - MORNING

Delacroix is the lone person of color in the elevator.

INT. CNS - MORNING

Delacroix gets off the elevator, takes out his ID, slips it

through the scanner and enters the reception area of CNS.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - MORNING

Delacroix walks, or better yet, slithers into the staff

meeting that is already in progress.  TWENTY WRITERS sit

around an oval table, all are Caucasian except Delacroix,

again he's the lone person of color, the "fly in the

buttermilk."

DUNWITTY, Senior V.P. of the Entertainment Division of CNS

looks at Delacroix and waits for him to sit down before he

continues.

Dunwitty looks at his Rolex Chronograph - Daytona Model.

Delacroix looks at his Jaeger-LeCoultre.

All eyes are on Delacroix and he feels it.

Dunwitty via remote turns off the lights and turns on an

overhead projector.

talks under his breath.

INT. DUNWITTY'S OFFICE - MORNING

Delacroix enters his corner office, which has huge action

photos of ALI, JORDAN, GRIFFEY, TYSON, AARON and JABBAR on

his walls, it is also decorated with African art throughout.

ANGLE ON

Office.  Dunwitty looks at the floor-to-ceiling windows

overlooking mid-town Manhattan.

They both laugh.

Dunwitty and Delacroix sit on the sofa.

Delacroix doesn't join him in his laughter because he

doesn't know how to take that comment or where Dunwitty is

headed with it.

Delacroix pounces on top of Dunwitty like a cat on a mouse

and gives him a quick BROOKLYN BEAT DOWN.

CLOSE ON

Dunwitty.  He's a bloody pulp.

CLOSE ON

Delacroix.

He straightens his tie.

POW.  This is a fantasy in Delacroix's mind.  We go BACK TO

REALITY.  Everything's how we left it.

He goes to his desk, picks up Delacroix's scripts and starts

throwing them one by one against the window.

EXT. TENEMENT - NIGHT

WE SEE a street lamp, and coming out of it are some wires.

WE FOLLOW the wires into a tenement building.

The residents have tapped into a street light courtesy of

CON EDISON for power.

INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

Cheeba stands in front of the makeshift kitchen, which

They both laugh.

INT. DELACROIX'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

INT. SLOAN'S STUDIO APARTMENT

She too jumps out of bed.

EXT. TENEMENT BUILDING

It is a MADHOUSE, BEDLAM.  It's PANDEMONIUM.  The Squatters

are being seized as soon as they come out of the tenement.

Searchlights go back and forth, as the cops make their

arrests and fill the "Paddy" wagons.

ANGLE ON

Street.  The Squatters are like ROACHES in a dark kitchen at

night, scrambling as the lights turn on.  Do you remember

those old "RAID" commercials.  "Let's scram, IT'S RAID!!!"

Delacroix looks at Sloan.

Dunwitty is dying with laughter.  He's the only one.

She laughs, it's a fake one at that.

Mantan starts to put on his new tap shoes.

Mantan is ready.

He starts to work out.

Dunwitty clears his desk of everything, just knocks stuff

flying onto the floor.  And Mantan taking the cue, jumps up

on his desk and really starts hitting it.

CLOSE ON

Delacroix, as he watches his creation, it's not a happy face.

on steroids and 64 ounce JUGULARS of DA BOMB MALT LIQUOR -

liquid crack, the preferred alcoholic beverage of GHETTO

NEGROES.  All the members of the MAU-MAU's are AFRICAN

AMERICAN except one.  There is one Caucasian member.  He

goes by the name 1/16th BLACK, the engineer tech-whiz kid

computer geek.

Big Black takes a long, long drag on a joint, then he
