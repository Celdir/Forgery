EXT. MAIN STREET, SMALL TOWN - DAY

A freight truck of late 1950's vintage pulls to the side of

the road in a small rural town. A handsome, well-built man

gets out of the passenger side and thanks the Driver. THE

NEWCOMER carries his coat over his shoulder and a beat-up

suitcase; he's got a jut jaw and a modified pompadour, his

shirtsleeves are rolled all the way up past his biceps. He

wipes his brow against the sweltering heat and looks around.

[Until noted below, this section of the movie is in BLACK &

WHITE.]

EXT. BOARDING HOUSE - DAY

Old three story gothic house in ill-repair beyond a peeling

picket fence and a scruffy yard. The sign says -- ROOMS TO

RENT. The Newcomer goes in the gate.

He squints through the dirty screen door but sees nothing,

then knocks and turns away to survey the neighborhood.

The Newcomer turns toward the door. Standing there, holding

the screen open, is the LANDLADY. She's a knockout in a cheap,

small-town way: a cotton dress that buttons down the front

and clings with sweat to her generous curves.

INT. BOARDING HOUSE - DAY

The Newcomer's POV of the Landlady as she leads him up the

narrow, gloomy stairs from the second floor to the third

story / attic. She has a Monroe-like sway to her walk. We

can barely HEAR her DISTANT, ECHOEY DIALOGUE:

The Landlady reaches the tiny landing at the top of the stairs

and opens a door to a squalid room with a bed, bureau and

tiny window. The Newcomer has to squeeze by her voluptuous

body to get inside and look around. It doesn't take long.

His gaze returns to the Landlady who is leaning against the

door, chest thrust forward. He focusses on her fingers, toying

with the button at her sweat-shiny cleavage.

The Newcomer takes a step in the Landlady's direction --

INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - (PRESENT) DAY

CLOSE-UP of MUMFORD wincing.

We see Mumford's office: the office of a Psychologist, a

therapist with a doctorate. It's modest, comfortable, neat,

with a calm, relaxed ambience. [The movie is now in COLOR.]

His patient, HENRY FOLLETT, looks nothing like The Newcomer

in the soft-core fantasy he's been narrating. Instead, he's

a mild-looking pharmacist with glasses and a receding

hairline. Only the voice is the same; it's as studly as his

fantasy alter-ego. Follett has been lying on a couch, but

now has twisted with some irritation to look at Mumford.

INT. LILY'S CAFE- DAY

Lunch crowd. Mumford can be seen out the big front window,

crossing from the two-story building that houses his office

on the main drag of this small town which, oddly enough, is

also called Mumford. He comes inside and goes to the counter

to pick up some take-out. The Proprietor is a woman around

forty named LILY, who talks to him as she works.

She comes over to the register with an order. Mumford is

am[...] her, likes her a lot.

A Patron passes on the way out.

Lily sees something out the window.

Mumford turns to look out the window. A young man of about

30, in jeans and a Hawaiian shirt, is skateboarding down the

street at high speed, weaving in and out amongst the cars.

He zips past the front of the restaurant.

LILY hands over Mumford's bagged order, rings it up. Back on

track:

Mumford is smiling as he goes out. Another Patron, LIONEL

DILLARD, a lawyer, brings his check to Lily, watching Mumford

cross the street. Lily can't stand this guy.

Lily gives him a look as she takes his money.

INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY

An overweight, teenage girl named NESSA WATKINS is on

Mumford's couch. She fidgets as she talks and can't decide

whether to lie down (so she's looking away from him) or sit

up and face him. She plays with an unlit cigarette and keeps

taking out a lighter, then stuffing it back in her big, sloppy

handbag.

She jams the cigarette in her mouth and flames the lighter,

but is afraid to actually break his rules.

Mumford indicates "nothing".

Mumford laughs.

Mumford waits.

EXT. HIKING TRAIL, MOUNTAIN FOREST - MAGIC

The last rays of sun are fighting their way through the trees

as Mumford comes up the trail he clearly knows very well.

EXT. BIG ROCK LOOKOUT POINT - MAGIC

Mumford climbs out on the Big Rock, settles himself on the

edge and takes a long drink from a water bottle.

WHAT HE SEES: far below at the foot of these hills, lights

just twinkling on, is the town of Mumford. He stares at it

for several long moments. Then he takes a small headlamp

from his pack and fits the straps over his head (it looks

like a miner's light). He twists the light on to test it and

turns his head to watch the beam move about.

WE CUT BACK WIDE. After a beat, Mumford settles back and

turns off the light.

INT. SCATTERGOOD'S TAVERN - NIGHT

The place is quietly busy with the regulars. Mumford has a

favorite spot at the far end of the bar. Right now he's

sitting alone, reading the remnants of a newspaper.

SKIP SKIPPERTON, the man on the skateboard, comes in. Everyone

in the bar is surprised to see Skip in here. Several patrons

greet him as he makes his way deeper inside, looking around.

He's uncomfortable. He seems relieved when he spots Mumford

and heads back there. Mumford doesn't notice Skip waiting

for his attention.

Mumford looks up, smiles. Skip offers his hand.

Mumford waits, friendly. Skip runs out of gas, gets uneasy,

glances around.

[...]

LATER. IN A BOOTH near the back. They've been at it a while,

but nothing is clear to Mumford, yet. Skip keeps his voice

down; he doesn't want anyone else in the bar to hear him.

Skip stares into his beer for a moment, as though the thought

depresses him. He catches himself and snaps back --

Skip glances around, leans in, confidential.

Mumford waits, watches. Skip gets uncomfortable.

Skip heads off to the bar. Mumford looks around. Everybody

is watching.

LATER. The bar crowd has thinned. Both Mumford and Skip have

had a few. In fact, Mumford is now carefully pouring them

each another drink from a bottle of Glensomething on the

table.

Skip beams. Mumford leans forward in the same confidential

way Skip did before; he indicates that Skip should lean in

too. Mumford is almost whispering --

Skip confirms that's it.

Skip makes a face and gesture to indicate a large "YES!",

but also total frustration and failure.

Mumford considers that.

Skip takes a few steps toward the men's room, then comes

back and leans down toward Mumford.

Skip stumbles off to take a leak. Mumford takes a moment to

digest that. It's difficult.

INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY

Mumford is listening to Lionel, the arrogant lawyer who asked

about him in the restaurant. Lionel is lying on the couch,

talking with enormous energy; he has a serious superiority

complex. Mumford can't stand him and the session seems to be

lasting an eternity.

Mumfords eyes dart to look at --

THE CLOCK on the bookshelf: 2:23

Lionel is twisting his neck around painfully to look back at

Mumford.

As Lionel goes on, Mumford's eyes again dart toward -- THE

CLOCK: still 2:23! Hold on it. Finally, it moves. Mumford's

eyes dart toward his desk --

A deadly-looking letter opener in the shape of Excalibur

stands GLINTING LIGHT in a marble rendition of Arthur's stone.

Mumford's head rocks slowly back for a moment as if he's

going to drift off. He snaps back to life and stares hard at

the top of Lionel's head, where there is a bald spot starting

to take hold. The sound of LIONEL'S VOICE begins to echo --

MUMFORD'S GLANCE FLASHPANS from Lionel's bald spot to the

gleaming letter opener.

Mumford closes his eyes. We CUT TO:

INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

A boy, unmistakably the Young Lionel, runs down the deserted

hallway toward a bright doorway. [LIONEL'S DREAM has a BLUE

TINT.]

INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

Young Lionel comes breathlessly in the classroom door and

stares alarmed.

WHAT YOUNG LIONEL SEES: Everyone in the class, including the

Teacher in the front, is naked. The Teacher holds out an

exam toward Young Lionel.

INT. WAITING ROOM, MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY

ALTHEA BROCKETT, a woman in her forties, sits on the couch

reading a mail order catalogue for home furnishings. There

are several other catalogues sticking out of her jammed,

woven carry-all.

The door to Mumford's inner office opens with some force.

Mumford stands looking back across his office at Lionel, who

is getting up from the couch in some confusion.

Lionel looks around, but there is no such sign. He does spot

Althea watching the show from the couch.

Althea stands up, smiling. She thinks Mumford is the bee's

knees.

Lionel steams by them in a black mood.

Lionel bangs out the front door. Mumford motions Althea inside --

Althea heads inside, giggling wildly. She can't get enough

of this guy.

INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE -DAY

Althea is sobbing. Mumford hands her a new Kleenex from the

box next to the couch. She wads it with her current one and

tries to stop crying. Mumford settles back in his chair,

patient.

Althea stares at him a long moment. She knows he's right.

Tears well up in her eyes and roll down her cheeks. She grabs

another Kleenex. In the midst of the torrent she tries to

talk, but it's undecipherable:

Althea uses three new tissues to dry up her face.

Mumford considers, then nods his assent.

EXT. MUMFORD'S STREET - MAGIC

Mumford hurries up the sidewalk carrying two grocery bags.

He's late. The modest houses are close together on this pretty

street, which rises out of the main business district, seen

beyond Mumford.

EXT. THE DUPLEX HOUSE - MAGIC

Mumford comes to the house where he lives. He heads down the

driveway toward the stairs that lead up to his apartment.

The front yard is completely fenced. Lily, the owner of the

restaurant, is almost visible in there working among the

greenery of a lush garden. Her friendly dog, AINGE, sees

Mumford, leaps easily over the fence and does a circle around

Mumford, who has no free hand to pet him.

The dog leaps gracefully back into the yard. Mumford hurries

up the stairs.

INT. MUMFORD'S APARTMENT - MAGIC

Mumford comes in and puts the bags down on the kitchen

counter. He goes directly to the table by his main chair and

picks up the TV remote. He switches it on and changes the

channel. The opening segment of UNSOLVED MYSTERIES is just

beginning. It previews the stories on that evening's episode --

disappearances and unclosed cases -- with Robert Stack

hosting.

CLOSE ON MUMFORD'S FACE as he watches. Only when the whole

show has been previewed does he seem to relax. He leaves the

show on as he goes into the kitchen and begins unloading the

bags.

INT. COOK'S HARDWARE STORE - DAY

Mumford is comparing different stepladders. MR. COOK, the

sixty-ish proprietor, has been watching from a distance, but

now --

Mystified, Mumford follows Cook through the door into the

back.

BACK OF THE STORE. Cook motions for Mumford to take the seat

of honor in the work area, but Mumford prefers to stand.

Cook has a little trouble figuring how to start. Finally --

Cook nods, but looks worried.

Cook is quick to agree; he doesn't want to make waves. But

he's worried.

EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

Mumford is walking up the busy sidewalk carrying his new 5-

foot stepladder hooked on his shoulder. Folks greet him.

Suddenly Lionel appears in front of Mumford, who stops.

Mumford continues up the street. We STAY WITH Lionel, who

watches Mumford with a sour look, then turns to enter a small

medical building.

INT. DR. DELBANCO'S OFFICE - DAY

DR. ERNEST DELBANCO, a middle-aged psychiatrist with longish,

vanity hair, and PHYLLIS SHEELER, a psychologist in her

thirties, sit on the doctor's comfortable furniture,

listening. The remains of their take-out lunch is on the

coffee table. They seem a little impatient with their as-yet-

unseen visitor --

Lionel is sitting across the room, making an ardent case --

Delbanco and Sheeler exchange a look; they find Lionel

distasteful.

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE DR. DELBANCO'S OFFICE - DAY

Lionel comes out of the office, miffed, and goes down the

stairs. A moment later, the door opens slightly and Delbanco

peeks out to make sure Lionel is gone. He closes the door on

us.

INT. DR. DELBANCO'S OFFICE - DAY

Delbanco stands at the door looking across the room at

Sheeler.

So does she.

EXT. BASEBALL DIAMOND - DAY

Idyllic. The beautifully manicured field is surrounded by

lush woods. Standing about forty feet apart, Mumford and

Skip are alone on the field throwing a baseball back and

forth. For quite a while the only sounds are the birds, the

wind, and the regular SLAP of ball into glove. Finally --

SLAP... SLAP.

SLAP... SLAP.

Mumford considers. SLAP... SLAP... SLAP.

Mumford gestures off in the one direction we have not yet

seen.

REVERSE ANGLE: The baseball diamond is sitting in the vast,

lush grounds behind the PANDA MODEM WORLD HEADQUARTERS, a

brand new, distinctively original, high-tech office park.

Wherever there is an opportunity for tasteful signage, it is

in the motif of a Giant Panda -- sweet white face, black

eyes and ears, round body.

Skip is suddenly self-conscious, embarrassed.

Mumford takes that in. SLAP... SLAP.

Skip is a little surprised to hear this from Mumford, but he

just throws the ball.

Skip is fascinated, but a little uncomfortable. Mumford seems

oblivious, unusually talkative --

For the first time, Mumford throws the ball way high, like a

long fly ball. Skip, delighted as a dog, takes off running

and just barely catches it on the run. He pegs it back to

Mumford.

INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY

Silence. Nessa sits staring at Mumford defiantly, an unlit

cigarette in her mouth. Mumford looks at the clock -- 3:00 --

and stands up, session over. Nessa quickly lights her

cigarette with the lighter concealed in her hand and stands

up too. She exhales a huge cloud of smoke and walks quickly

to the back door of the office, which Mumford has opened for

her, and goes out.

Mumford waves half-heartedly at the cloud of smoke as he

walks to the door to the waiting room and opens it.

MUMFORD'S POV: As the door swings open, the first figure we

see is Mr. Cook; he twists around at the sound of the door.

He acknowledges Mumford and then sighs as he steps aside to

reveal, sitting exhausted in a chair, his daughter --

SOFIE -- a young woman whose actual appearance is somewhat

disguised at present by her wan, ashen visage. She regards

Mumford with some resignation. Her father helps her out of

the chair. Sofie keeps her eyes on Mumford.

CLOSE ON Mumford, watching her.

INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY

LATER. Mr. Cook is gone. Sofie is sitting up on the couch,

facing Mumford. She looks like she might pass out at any

moment, but her voice is stronger than you'd expect.

A joke. Mumford smiles.

It's taken all her energy to say this and she sinks down a

bit into the couch.

She sees something in his face and suddenly laughs -- it's a

weak but magical sound.

Mumford is knocked off balance -- she's right. She saw him

clearly.

Sofie suddenly looks defeated.

Sofie gives him a long look.

Mumford just smiles. He doesn't want to tell her the truth --

everything.

EXT. BROCKETT HOUSE - MAGIC

A taxi drops Mumford in front of the Brockett's large and

beautiful house, which sits on an isolated lot on the

outskirts of town.

INT. HALLWAY TO BACK VERANDA, BROCKETT HOUSE - MAGIC

Althea leads Mumford toward the back of the lavishly appointed

house. The weird thing, what gets in the way of the decor,

is the cardboard boxes of all sizes which are stacked

everywhere. Many are unopened, but the rest are spilling

their styrofoam-nugget and bubble-wrap guts to reveal some

hint of their contents: a huge variety of catalogue-ordered

housewares, clothing, linens, gadgets, and knickknacks. If

it can be ordered from an upscale catalogue (and everything

can), it is here. Althea sounds very nervous, cheery.

EXT. REAR VERANDA, BROCKETT HOUSE - MAGIC

They come out onto the wide porch, which commands a

spectacular view of the surrounding countryside. There's an

elaborate bar cart out here, which Althea points Mumford

toward.

She disappears inside with a bang of the screen door. Mumford

gets a drink for himself, taking in the view. He sees

something out there.

MUMFORD'S POV: Way in the distance, coming out of the woods

and down toward the house is a teenage boy.

Mumford turns to see that Althea's thirteen year old daughter

KATIE has silently appeared. Her jeans and little tee-shirt

are meant to be sexy; it seems sad on her. Mumford nods.

Mumford follows as she disappears around the corner of the

porch.

INT. SIDE HALL, BROCKETT HOUSE - MAGIC

Mumford follows Katie into a gloomy hall from a side entrance.

Here too, the walls are lined with boxes. She tiptoes to one

of two facing doors and waits for him.

When he has joined her, she motions him back a foot for

safety, then carefully opens the door to a large walk-in

closet. Katie's caution becomes understandable: the space is

packed so fully and chaotically with catalogue item cartons

that it might come tumbling out the door with one careless

move. Katie closes the door, then pirouettes to the opposing

door, which she swings open freely -- REVEALING: what was

once a study is now completely filled with hundreds of

cartons, in an infinite variety of shapes and sizes.

Mumford is taken aback. Katie points at packages and speaks

in a hypnotic WHISPER --

EXT. REAR VERANDA, BROCKETT HOUSE - MAGIC

Just as Mumford and Katie come back around the corner, MARTIN,

Althea's sixteen year old son, crosses the yard and comes up

onto the porch. He's wearing an old black leather jacket

with a lot of zippers, dirty jeans and black Converse All-

Stars that are coming apart. In his hand, casually but

properly held, is a .22 caliber rifle. He looks Mumford over.

Mumford takes them both in and nods. He understands. Suddenly,

their manner changes, for the worse. What they can see that

Mumford cannot is JEREMY BROCKETT, Althea's husband, who has

come to the back screen door, with the bustle of a late

arrival.

Seeing Mumford, Jeremy steps out onto the porch to shake his

hand. Jeremy is quite handsome and a fantastic dresser; his

Armani outfit cost $4200 all in. His tone: hearty and strained --

Jeremy goes inside. Martin and Katie exchange a look with

each other, then to Mumford. Martin goes inside.

EXT. REAR VERANDA, BROCKETT HOUSE - NIGHT

LATER. Dinner is over. Jeremy comes out onto the veranda

carrying two Cuban cigars. His casual outfit is as stylish

and pricey as his work outfit. He joins Mumford and Althea,

who immediately gets up.

She goes inside. The men each have a snifter of cognac. Jeremy

makes a ceremony of cutting the cigars --

Jeremy puts the cigars down, pulls a joint out of his cashmere

pullover and fires it up. After exhaling a huge cloud of

smoke, he offers the joint to Mumford, who declines.

Jeremy takes another hit on the joint and puts it down. He

gives a cigar and his gold lighter to Mumford, who begins to

light up --

Mumford does as he's told. Jeremy lights his own cigar.

The marijuana is kicking in now -- Jeremy gets a self-

satisfied, condescending look on his face that no straight

mind would dare. His response includes their lavish immediate

surroundings--

Jeremy blows cigar smoke into his snifter, then takes a

mouthful of cognac, savoring the sensations. Mumford watches,

fascinated by this guy.

Jeremy gives him a look, as if to say "duh."

Mumford looks at him a long time.

EXT. ROAD INTO MUMFORD - NIGHT

Jeremy Brockett's Mercedes 500 SL whips around a curve.

INT. BROCKETT'S MERCEDES - NIGHT

Martin is driving Mumford back to town.

They drive in silence for a bit. Then --

Mumford gives him a surprised look, then acknowledges it.

Mumford knew that.

Mumford regards Martin with respect, then turns to look out

front. After a few moments --

EXT. THE DUPLEX HOUSE - NIGHT

Lily is walking Ainge as the Mercedes pulls up and Mumford

gets out. Ainge runs happily around the car and puts his

paws up on the driver's door to greet Martin; we HEAR the

clicking SCRATCH of his nails on the surface. Martin rubs

the dog's head.

The dog obediently leaves Martin and runs back to Lily.

Mumford waves as Martin pulls away.

They walk up the block with the dog.

Mumford laughs.

INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY

TIGHT ON COMPUTER SCREEN. A health information "library"

website has been called up on Mumford's office computer.

Right now it's beginning to spew information about "CHRONIC

FATIGUE SYNDROME" -- Definitions, Signs and Symptoms,

Diagnostic Measures, etc.

Mumford is hunched over the computer, reading avidly. His

printer is churning out hard copies.

EXT. FRONT PORCH, COOK HOUSE - DAY

Mumford comes out the front door and holds it open for Sofie.

He offers his arm and she takes it tentatively.

Mumford looks out toward the street. A woman in her fifties

is turning into the front walk. She stares at them, unsmiling,

as the two parties converge. She is MRS. COOK.

She finally takes his hand, but it's not friendly.

Mrs. Cook is not amused. Sofie pulls on Mumford.

Mrs. Cook steps aside as they move up the walk.

EXT. SIDEWALK, NEAR THE COOK HOUSE - DAY

Mumford and Sofie, foreground, walk slowly up the block. In

the background, Mrs. Cook watches for awhile before going

inside.

Sofie suddenly seems to be fading.

She looks at him, unsure if he's serious. It seems so corny.

But she agrees.

She laughs again; surprised again. He's got her off balance

makes a "rim shot" sound.

They've come to the corner. He gestures to ask -- "shall we

cross?" She considers for quite a while, gauging her strength,

then, still on his arm, steps off the curb --

THEY CROSS OUT OF FRAME as we HEAR:

EXT. PATH BY RIVER - DAY

ANOTHER DAY. They're dressed differently. Sofie seems more

vigorous.

INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY

CLOSE ON COMPUTER SCREEN. Under the list of Signs and

Symptoms: "Sore throat."

ON THE SCREEN: "Low grade fever... Painful lymph glands...

Irritability..."

EXT. PATH BY RIVER - DAY

Sofie nods.

EXT. HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETIC FIELD - DAY

ANOTHER DAY. Mumford is leading Sofie through the lightest

set of calisthenics ever devised. Now they're doing waist

bends and arm waving. Even so, it's taking everything Sofie's

got.

She considers that, reluctantly agrees.

Sofie's not sure how to take that. She looks away.

INT. BOARDING HOUSE (IN HENRY FOLLETT'S FANTASY) - DAY

The handsome Newcomer of Follett's fantasy comes down the

steps from the attic wearing a sleeveless undershirt, towel

thrown over his shoulder. He goes into the bathroom off the

second floor hall and begins to wash up. [Again, Follett's

fantasy world is in BLACK & WHITE.]

IN THE BATHROOM MIRROR, the Newcomer's POV: a nubile teenager,

17 going on 35, in a tight cheerleader's outfit, comes up

the stairs and stops at the top to turn and yell back down

at her mother. Her dialogue distant and echoey:

The LANDLADY'S DAUGHTER looks up and sees the Newcomer

watching her through the half-open bathroom door. She gives

him a petulant, white-hot look, then turns on her heel and

goes into her room at that end of the hall. She bangs her

door behind her, but it bounces open again about a foot. The

Newcomer, still watching in the bathroom mirror, now has a

view of the bureau mirror in the Landlady's Daughter's room.

In there, seemingly oblivious, the girl quickly strips off

the top of her outfit, revealing a '50's-era white bra.

Suddenly, in mirror reflection of mirror, the Landlady's

Daughter meets the Newcomer's smoldering stare and her lip

begins to curl.

Mysteriously, the door to the girl's bedroom slams shut,

cutting off the Newcomer's view. He looks with surprise into

his mirror -- it suddenly shatters.

INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY

Follett sits up abruptly on the couch and twists toward

Mumford, agitated.

Mumford's tone suddenly picks up a touch of steel.

Follett flinches, settles back down onto the couch, sulking.

Follett mutters something to himself, then is silent until --

Follett seems to shrink in size. They've been here before

and he doesn't like it.

Again, Follett says something under his breath.

EXT. HIKING TRAIL - MAGIC

Mumford strides up the trail on his late day excursion. He

comes around a bend and is surprised to find Skip waiting

for him, looking serious.

Mumford indicates that Skip should walk with him up the trail.

They walk in silence for a while.

EXT. BIG ROCK LOOKOUT POINT - MAGIC

Mumford and Skip come out of the trees, climb onto the big

rock, and settle down. The sun is falling over the town of

Mumford.

He checks Mumford's reaction. Mumford nods, offers Skip water,

who turns it down. Mumford takes a swig.

Skip, even more unsure now, looks away, at the town below.

Mumford lets that hang a few moments, then acknowledges it

silently. Now Skip is even more nervous.

Mumford looks at Skip for a long moment.

The conversation seems to end there. Skip's not sure where

to go next. Finally --

Skip looks around at the darkening woods, though clearly

there's no one around.

Skip closes his eyes for a second and gathers himself.

Mumford shakes his head, "no."

Mumford tries to put that all together. Finally --

Mumford considers that a long time, watching as the sun

finally sinks below the horizon. He looks back at Skip.

It's getting dark fast now. Mumford reaches into his bag and

takes out the headlamp we saw earlier. He fits the straps

carefully over his head.

Mumford twists the headlamp and the light shines out in the

dusk. Mumford turns the beam directly at Skip.

Skip, hanging on every word now, agrees emphatically.

At first, Skip thinks he's misunderstood Mumford. But in the

huge silence that ensues, he replays it and knows he's heard

right. Mumford looks around, adjusts his headlamp, and gets

up.

EXT. MUMFORD'S PORCH, THE DUPLEX HOUSE - NIGHT

This porch is directly above Lily's porch. Mumford and Skip

sit nursing beers. There's a cooler on the floor. Mumford's

legs are propped up on the porch railing

Mumford takes a drink of beer.

Mumford gestures: "sorry, no can do."

Mumford looks at Skip, considering. He takes a long pull

from his beer, then looks at the frosty bottle.

AS MUMFORD TALKS we SEE IMAGES FROM HIS PAST, all FROM

MUMFORD'S POV. We do not see him in the scenes. Instead,

everyone else in the scene RELATES TO THE CAMERA AS MUMFORD,

even if they're just ignoring him.

EXT. MUMFORD'S CHILDHOOD HOME, BALD KNOB, WEST VIRGINIA -

MAGIC

MOVING FAST (MUMFORD'S CHILDHOOD POV) toward the back door

of a rundown, little house in a poor mining community. We

reach the back door and bang inside --

INT. MUMFORD'S CHILDHOOD HOME - MAGIC

The cramped interior is grimy and depressing. MUMFORD'S MOTHER

worse for wear, has just put a glass of liquor on the sink

and returned her attention to the smoking stovetop. She

glances briefly at Mumford and greets him pleasantly, clearly

drunk. Suddenly, her attention shifts and we -- PAN TO THE

FRONT DOOR which is opened roughly by MUMFORD'S FATHER, a

coal miner whose face still shows the grime of his work. But

it's his scary scowl that impresses. His eyes take in his

wife (and her drink) but he says nothing. He barely gives

Mumford a glance as he drops his lunch pail on the table and

disappears into another room.

AT THE DINNER TABLE. Across the table, MUMFORD'S OLDER SISTER

eats with her head down. On the right, Mumford's Mother is

picking at her food. Mumford's POV shifts to his Father, who

is yelling something at his wife.

Now, his Father looks suddenly at Mumford; his hand shoots

out to slap Mumford's face, and the IMAGE GOES BLACK, then

immediately FADES UP AGAIN on --

INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM, WEST VIRGINIA - DAY

TIGHT ON A TEST PAPER being laid on an old-fashioned student

desk. Scrawled in red pencil at the top: "A -- Outstanding!"

TILT UP to the old classroom, full of kids getting their

tests back. ACROSS THE AISLE, looking at camera with disgust,

is a sixteen year old boy, MUMFORD'S CLASSMATE.

EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - NIGHT

FROM INSIDE A HELMET: the brutal chaos of crashing bodies in

a Friday night high school football game. Mumford is violently

hit. Our view is smashed so deep into the muddy turf that

again the IMAGE GOES BLACK, then quickly FADES UP AGAIN on --

INT./EXT. LOVER'S LANE, WOODS - NIGHT

TIGHT ON A CAN OF "IRON CITY" BEER in MUMFORD'S POV as he

puts it on the roof of a green Nash Rambler and ducks into

the back seat. In the shadows is a teen-age girl, MUMFORD'S

DATE. As Mumford moves toward her, she flames a Bic lighter

and gleefully lights a fat joint; her blouse is unbuttoned

and gaping.

EXT. HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY

Graduation Ceremonies. MUMFORD'S POV moving across a platform

toward the diploma being proffered by the PRINCIPAL. PAN TO

Mumford's Parents, dressed up and proud, in the audience.

INT. UNIVERSITY DORMITORY HALLWAY - DAY

TIGHT ON A DORM ROOM DOOR as it is pushed open. MUMFORD'S

NEW ROOMMATE, a crazed, middle-class doper, has his stuff

spread around and is settled in the midst of the chaos. He

looks up at the arriving Mumford with a maniacal, stoned

smile.

INT. COLLEGE APARTMENT - NIGHT

TIGHT ON A BONG filling with white smoke. We FOLLOW IT UP

THE TUBE to a PRETTY COED, who inhales deeply, then blows a

seductive cloud directly at Mumford. The room is full of

partying students.

INT. BEDROOM, STUDENT APARTMENT - NIGHT

Funky decor, red scarf over the lamp creating a sexy glow.

MUMFORD'S POV moves toward an undulating shape hidden by a

sheet on the bed. He reaches out and lifts the edge to REVEAL

the Pretty Coed, now naked, giggling, her extended hand

offering a tab of acid right up to camera.

INT. UNIVERSITY CLASSROOM - DAY

A PROFESSOR approaches camera and lays a fresh examination

on the desk in front of Mumford. The problem is -- Mumford

is so doped up the classroom is swimming and the examination

paper keeps changing shape.

INT. OFFICE BUILDING CORRIDOR - NIGHT

TIGHT ON SEVERAL AMPHETAMINE CAPSULES being dumped into

Mumford's palm over a water fountain. They disappear toward

camera as we dip down toward the stream of water.

MUMFORD'S POV lifts from the fountain and turns to the

endless, deserted corridor of the huge building. We begin

TRACKING DOWN the hall, checking out the various doorways. A

Cleaning Crew appears far up ahead.

EXT. ALLEY - DAY

We PAN from the back of a garbage truck to a mess of garbage

containers, and MOVE TOWARD THEM.

INT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

TIGHT ON TWO LINES of cocaine. We DIP TOWARD THEM, then UP

AGAIN and they're gone. PAN to REVEAL we're in a closet off

the brightly-lit office of an all-night gas station. A PATRON

is waiting impatiently out by the pumps.

EXT. SECOND FLOOR PORCH, THE DUPLEX HOUSE - NIGHT

BACK TO PRESENT. Skip watches Mumford intently.

Mumford stands up and stretches, then sits on the railing

facing Skip.

INT./EXT. SERIES OF SHOTS-- TALKING HEADS

We see various CO-WORKERS from Mumford's jobs. The

environments are radically different, but the activity is

always the same -- the Co-Worker in question is pouring his

heart out to camera.

INT. CRAWLSPACE UNDER HOUSE - DAY

MUMFORD'S MOVING POV as he crawls into the darkness, an

insecticide sprayer ahead of him. He pushes at a cinderblock --

The cinderblock tips over and a swarm of scary-looking spiders

comes rushing out toward camera.

INT. GOVERNMENT OFFICES - DAY

FROM BEHIND A DESK in the middle of a huge sea of desks.

SERIES OF SHOTS: computer records scrolling rapidly, paper

files being pulled, documents being routed.

INT. YMCA GYM - NIGHT

An intense basketball game. The ball zips from behind camera

(Mumford) to an older guy, MUMFORD'S SUPERVISOR, under the

basket; he lays it in easily, then comes over to high-five.

INT. KITCHEN TABLE, MUMFORD'S CITY APARTMENT (PAST) - NIGHT

A COCAINE MILL is loaded with white chunks and screwed shut

in MUMFORD'S POV; the steady grinding begins. Spread across

the messy kitchen table is the regular user's paraphernalia.

INT. INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE OFFICES - DAY

MUMFORD'S POV SHIFTS around the office. First, he's looking

at an irate TAXPAYER yelling across a desk at a REVENUE

OFFICER, who remains unruffled --

His POV PANS with a couple of intense COLLECTION AGENTS who

pass behind the first scene on their way out of the offices.

His POV STOPS, letting the Collection Agents go, on another

fellow, with the disreputable, cocksure demeanor of a private

dick, who is lolling near the water cooler, watching the

altercation with amusement. He is GREGORY, an IRS

INVESTIGATOR.

EXT. SECOND FLOOR PORCH, THE DUPLEX HOUSE - NIGHT

BACK TO PRESENT. Skip is leaning intensely toward Mumford.

EXT. ALLEY, REAR OF DRY CLEANING FACILITY - MAGIC

MOVING POV as Mumford follows GREGORY down the gloomy alley

to a corner where they can spy at the scene beyond.

WHAT THEY SEE: The DRY CLEANING BOSS, a Middle-Eastern fellow,

is standing at the back door of his place paying his Asian

employees in cash as they leave.

Gregory turns to look at camera (Mumford) with a devilish

grin.

INT. GREGORY'S HOUSE, CITY STREET - NIGHT

MUMFORD'S POV as he supports a drunken Gregory as they stagger

down the sidewalk to a row house. Holding Gregory up on the

other side, is CANDY, Gregory's pretty wife. They wrangle

Gregory up the front steps. Gregory stumbles inside and

Mumford retreats down the steps, his eyes still on the front

door. Candy appears there and stares down at Mumford, who

stops where he is.

EXT. SECOND FLOOR PORCH, THE DUPLEX HOUSE - NIGHT

Mumford settles back in his chair as Skip shakes his head,

astounded.

Skip stops, remembers the truth, realizes. Mumford smiles.

INT. BEDROOM, MUMFORD'S CITY APARTMENT - DAY

MUMFORD'S POV from his bed. Candy finishes dressing across

the room. She looks at camera, her face full of the pain of

leaving.

EXT. FIRESCAPE/ROOF, BUILDING IN CITY - DAY

MOVING POV as Mumford follows Gregory up the ladder and onto

the roof of this old building in a rundown industrial

neighborhood.

Mumford follows Gregory, crawling, to the edge of the roof

and looks down on a building one block over. It is a small

furniture factory. Employees are eating their lunches on the

loading dock.

INT. ETHNIC RESTAURANT - NIGHT

MUMFORD'S POV takes in his ATTRACTIVE DATE next to him, then

PANS TO Candy and Gregory across the table. Everybody's

laughing. Candy flashes Mumford a momentary special look.

MUMFORD'S POV guiltily PANS TO Gregory. Did he see it?

EXT. PARKING LOT, FURNITURE FACTORY - MAGIC

BINOCULAR VIEW of EDMOND WORRELL and MRS. WORRELL as they

get in a Cadillac at the end of a workday.

INT. BUSINESS OFFICE, WORRELL FURNITURE FACTORY - NIGHT

Lit by powerful flashlights, Gregory and Mumford attack the

files of the company, both in cabinets and on computer.

INT. MEN'S ROOM, WORRELL FURNITURE FACTORY - NIGHT

EXTREME CLOSE-UP A LINE OF COCAINE on the top of a toilet

tank as it is sucked out of sight.

INT. BEDROOM, MUMFORD'S CITY APARTMENT - DAY

MUMFORD'S POV IS A BLURRY SHAPE until Candy moves up and

away, her face sweaty and aroused, torso naked. She's on top

of Mumford.

INT. GOVERNMENT CAR - DAY

Mumford's POV slides into the passenger seat. Gregory is

already sitting in the driver's seat. He stares at Mumford a

long time.

INT. CORRIDOR, SHABBY OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

Mumford is following Gregory and REVENUE OFFICER MCLURE down

the hall. They reach a door with the painted sign: "SAMUEL

GORBECK, C.P.A."

As they start to enter, SOFT CUT TO:

INT. GORBECK'S INNER OFFICE - DAY

GORBECK listens, intimidated by McLure, who sits on the

accountant's desk, and Gregory, who is moving around the

office -- snooping.

INT. IRS OFFICES - DAY

Edmond Worrell, his wife, his adult SON and DAUGHTER,

WORRELL'S LAWYER, and, finally, the accountant Gorbeck are

ushered toward a conference room by McLure, Gregory and some

other IRS types. Gorbeck sneaks a nervous look at Mumford.

Gregory, who now appears slightly mad, motions for Mumford

to join them.

EXT. PARKING LOT, WORRELL FURNITURE FACTORY - DAY

MOVING POV OUT THE WINDSHIELD of Gregory's government car as

it comes speeding into the parking lot. There are two flashing

Squad Cars and an Ambulance at the entrance. As Gregory's

car hits a speedbump, the IMAGE BEGINS TO SLOW DOWN --

The IMAGE HAS SLOWED TO A STILL. It now DISSOLVES TO:

EXT. GREGORY'S HOUSE, CITY STREET - NIGHT

Mumford's POV as he comes up the steps. The front door opens

before he gets there. Candy, her face bruised, her eyes red,

comes into view, she has a suitcase in hand.

INT. BEDROOM, MUMFORD'S CITY APARTMENT - NIGHT

Mumford is frantically, futilely looking for an imagined

drug stash. He's ransacked the place and is now throwing the

clothes out of a drawer.

INT. BATHROOM, MUMFORD'S CITY APARTMENT - NIGHT

Mumford looks desperately through the pill bottles and

detritus in his squalid medicine cabinet.

Giving up, Mumford slams the medicine cabinet shut and FOR

THE FIRST TIME SINCE HIS STORY BEGAN, WE SEE MUMFORD in his

previous incarnation. And this is probably as bad as he ever

looked. He stares at his image in the mirror.

EXT. SECOND FLOOR PORCH, THE DUPLEX HOUSE - NIGHT

Skip is staring at Mumford. Empty beer bottles are lined up

on the porch railing.

Mumford nods.

INT. DESERT DRUG REHAB CENTER - SUNRISE

A venetian blind is raised, revealing sunrise over a desert

landscape.

EXT. SECOND FLOOR PORCH, THE DUPLEX HOUSE - NIGHT

Mumford gets up from his chair and moves toward his door.

Mumford goes inside. Skip sits listening to the night. From

downstairs, in Lily's apartment, he HEARS A SHOWER GO ON.

Mumford comes back out.

INT. ANONYMOUS WORK ROOM - DAY

ON A COMPUTER SCREEN an elaborate graphics program is creating

the filigreed border of a birth certificate that already

bears the official-looking designs of "Green County, State

of West Virginia".

As the border is completed, we PUSH IN and DISSOLVE THROUGH

TO:

SURFACE OF A DESK, with an electric Smith-Corona typewriter

(late '50's vintage). EXTREME CLOSE-UP of the keys hammering

out individual letters and numbers: date, hospital, attending

physician.

EXT. SECOND FLOOR PORCH, THE DUPLEX HOUSE - NIGHT

Mumford looks at Skip.

INT. ANONYMOUS WORK ROOM - DAY

The typewriter is just pounding out: MICHAEL OLIVER MUM-F-O-

R-D.

ON A KITCHEN TABLE, the new birth certificate, now filled

out for Michael Mumford, is carefully lifted from a shallow

bowl of light tea (the tea bags are nearby). The paper has

taken on an aged, sepia look. CUT TO:

A STACK OF BOOKS. The ones on top are lifted away. The bottom

book is opened to reveal the birth certificate. It has been

folded in an official way. Now Mumford unfolds it, then

refolds it differently -- with its smudges and creases, it's

starting to look old.

SERIES OF SHOTS of Mumford's DOCUMENTATION PILING UP. A post

office box is emptied, official-looking correspondence is

opened, the bounty is laid out for perusal: Social Security

card, driver's license, college and graduate school diplomas,

license and accreditation to operate as a therapist.

EXT. SECOND FLOOR PORCH, THE DUPLEX HOUSE - NIGHT

Skip looks upset.

He heads inside.

Mumford goes inside. Skip nods, head spinning.

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - SUNRISE

Mumford and Sofie are delivering newspapers in lovely first

light. Mumford has a canvas sack full of newspapers around

his neck. At each house, he consults the list in his hand,

then hands Sofie a rolled-up paper, which she throws -- with

varying success -- toward the front doors. The activity is

tiring for her, but she's committed.

Mumford hands her another paper, which she heaves with all

her limited strength, missing the front porch badly. Mumford,

who can't get enough of watching her, doesn't notice at first.

Mumford snaps out of it. He goes up on the lawn and flips

the paper deftly onto the porch. As they continue --

She leans against the iron handrail on some front steps,

breathing hard.

She laughs. They're playing with each other.

Sofie starts walking again, taking another newspaper from

his sack. He points to the next house.

Sofie heaves the paper squarely onto the porch. She turns to

him with pride, but when she sees the way he looks at her,

she glances away, uncomfortable.

Mumford hands her another paper and indicates the next house.

INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY

TIGHT ON RAPID SERIES OF IMAGES on slick, glossy magazine

pages: each change of image is punctuated by the AMPLIFIED

SNAP of the page being turned, like a gunshot. We're SO CLOSE

to the images we can't tell when the magazines change --

from Glamour to Vogue to Us to Mademoiselle to W to Vanity

Fair. And it doesn't matter. Whether the images are ads or

fashion spreads or celebrity candids, the look is the same --

jaded, hip, disinterested, apathetic, either impossibly buff

or anorexic, but always severely beautiful. The PAGE TURNING

starts at a fevered pitch and becomes even more intense.

Finally --

The IMAGES CONTINUE.

Mumford is sitting next to Nessa on the couch. At their feet

is a mess of magazines. Nessa discards one and immediately

starts flipping through a new one beneath it. She is very

agitated. Mumford stands up, walks over and sits in his chair.

A look of panic crosses Nessa's face, but she instantly hides

it, busily taking out cigarette and lighter, which she doesn't

use. Instead, she lies down on the couch, balancing the closed

magazine on her chest.

Mumford waits. Nessa refers to the magazine beneath her chin.

Nessa suddenly seems on the edge of tears, but beats it back.

EXT. LILY'S CAFE, MAIN STREET - DAY

Mumford crosses the street from his office. A huge bus with

"APPLEJACK TOURS" on the sides, is disgorging its passengers,

a large group of elderly JAPANESE WOMEN, all of whom file

neatly into Lily's Cafe. Lily stands on the sidewalk outside

greeting them merrily.

Lily continues her welcomes, but points out a hand-lettered

sign in her front window -- "Closed for Lunch. See you

tomorrow."

Mumford's attention is suddenly drawn to something across

the street. He glances thoughtfully at Lily for a moment,

then back out there.

WHAT HE SEES: Skip is once again zipping down the street on

his skateboard in the midst of traffic. He has not noticed

Mumford.

Skip looks over, then immediately changes course toward them,

barely checking the surrounding traffic. He is extraordinarily

skillful. When he gets to the curb, he pulls a snazzy board-

flipping maneuver to dismount and come up on the sidewalk.

Some of the Japanese matrons react with delight.

Skip notices the tour members filing by, but is immediately

distracted by the presence of Lily, who's a little excited

to meet the local celebrity.

Skip can't believe what he just said. Neither can the other

two, actually. Mumford can't stop himself from laughing, but

he cuts it off fast. Lily blushes, but Skip's agitation has

charmed her. Something's happening here.

He's making a joke and it represents quite a recovery. They're

all relieved. Then there's an awkward silence. Skip watches

the last of the tour enter the restaurant.

Lily gives him a careful look: Is he really interested?

There's something about him...

She motions him in and starts to follow. Mumford makes a

"what about me?" sound. Lily, grinning, just points to the

sign and leaves Mumford standing on the sidewalk.

Mumford turns to find Dr. Delbanco and Phyllis Sheeler, the

shrinks Lionel had conferred with, standing nearby. It takes

a moment for Mumford to remember Delbanco. Finally, shaking

hands --

Mumford makes a show of remembering.

The other two nod in unison. Mumford considers, trapped.

INT. THE LANTERN AND THE LAMB RESTAURANT - DAY

The town's upscale dining spot. Mumford, Delbanco and Sheeler

are in a red leather booth. Sheeler listens with rapt,

admiring attention as Delbanco speaks --

Mumford nods appreciatively. (He really is an extraordinary

listener.) Delbanco catches his own vanity in Sheeler's

adoring gaze and becomes self-conscious --

Mumford's response, and all that follow, is calm and pleasant.

Delbanco and Sheeler exchange a look. Sheeler adopts a

"casual" tone --

A dark look comes over Sheeler's face for a moment.

Mumford sits back, considering the couple across the table.

His gaze is so crystalline that, after a moment, they become

uncomfortable and steal a glance at each other. Finally --

INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY

CLOSE ON Althea Brockett.

Althea is sitting on the couch facing Mumford. She has a

bulky knit cardigan sweater hugged tightly around her -- the

only sign that she's not completely calm.

Mumford looks away. Althea realizes what he's thinking.

It hadn't occurred to Mumford, but it's an interesting

thought.

She stops, shakes her head.

Mumford nods.

She glances at her watch, then starts talking fast --

She is beaming, but suddenly becomes self-conscious. She

stands up abruptly, flushed.

She takes off the bulky sweater and bends to pick up her

purse. She is wearing a simple cotton dress that buttons up

the front and hugs her body. WE SEE for the first time what

all her other outfits have hidden: Althea has a terrific,

voluptuous figure.

She heads toward the door to the waiting room. Mumford

indicates the back door.

She opens the door to the waiting room, startling Henry

Follett, who jumps up from a chair out there, magazine still

in hand.

INT. WAITING ROOM, MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY

Follett is embarrassed to be discovered here. But that's

secondary to the impact Althea's current appearance -- sexy

body framed in the doorway -- is having on him. She's been a

customer in his store, but he's seeing her now as if for the

first time. All his libidinous buttons are being pushed.

Althea breezes by, oblivious to his reaction.

She goes out.

But Follett continues to stare in the direction Althea has

gone.

INT. LOBBY ATRIUM, PANDA MODEM WORLD HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Mumford is being escorted across the spectacular atrium by a

PANDA SECURITY AIDE. Her informal uniform, and all the other

details in the building, carry out the Panda design motif.

As they head down the main corridor --

Mumford looks that way. In the distance, Skip is descending

from an upper level on his skateboard via a unique system of

ramps designed for that purpose alone. None of the hustling

Panda Employees in the area take any particular notice of

the sight.

Skip meets Mumford and his escort at the bottom of the ramp

with a spectacular stop.

The Security Aide retreats as Skip (riding slowly alongside)

leads Mumford into a side corridor.

INT. BOWELS OF THE BUILDING, PANDA MODEM HEADQUARTERS - DAY

SERIES OF SHOTS. Skip and Mumford move through a maze of

hallways with progressively less foot traffic.

Skip is pleased. They approach a heavy steel door, the

entrance to Skip's Workshop. A VERY OLD SECURITY AIDE sits

at the end of the intersecting hallway, watching this area.

Skip shouts down there --

The old man nods, barely awake.

Skip puts his hand in a scanning device in the wall. Some

lights blink and the heavy metal door pops open a few inches.

Skip has to put all his weight into opening the door. He

hesitates, suddenly concerned --

Mumford reassures him with a look. Skip pushes the door open

far enough for them to enter, then pulls it closed behind

them.

INT. SKIP'S WORKSHOP - DAY

Mumford and Skip enter the large, windowless workspace. What

at first appears chaotic is, in fact, carefully organized.

Many different disciplines interface here:

THE BODY SECTION: The first thing one notices -- some

incredibly life-like, anatomically correct,

sculpture/mannequins -- both male and female. You half expect

them to breathe. From there, a full wall of forms descends

from store mannequins and skeletons all the way down to a

huge variety of inflatable sex dolls.

THE CYBER SECTION: A dizzying array of computers and screens,

some showing wire-form outlines of body parts in repeated

motion. Above them, on a huge corkboard, hundreds of computer

generated renderings of skin, eyes, limbs, sexual organs.

THE BODY PARTS SECTION: Medical models of teeth, eyes, lips,

limbs. Hundreds of porn store samples: plastic dildos, rubber

vaginas, sucking machines and sundry genitalia.

THE FORM-CASTING SHOP: All the machinery you need to make

rubber and acrylic forms of anything that can be computer

designed.

All these weird objects are set upon shiny, spotless, high-

tech work surfaces. Skip watches Mumford move about in awe,

picking up the odd item.

Skip looks at Mumford, a wide grin on his face.

Skip settles in front of the Body Parts section, framed by

an array of limbs and sex toys. There's an assembled pelvic

section with upper legs lying in the clutter behind him.

Skip leans back against the table and accidentally hits a

button. The pelvic section begins to hump, slowly and

sensually, in place. It's amazingly life-like, but it makes

a mechanical WHIRRING SOUND. Skip fumbles to turn it off.

Skip gets the pelvis switched off and turns back to Mumford.

Mumford sinks into silence. He begins to wander the room.

Mumford nods. Skip is desperate to say something useful.

Suddenly, he has an alarming thought.

Mumford understands and can't stop a laugh.

Skip is relieved. He has another thought and brightens.

Mumford turns to meet Skip's gaze. Skip realizes the

ramifications of what he's just said.

INT. DR. DELBANCO'S OFFICE - DAY

Lionel is here with Delbanco and Sheeler. This time, Delbanco

is behind his desk, Sheeler across the room on the sofa.

Lionel's derisive snort is so obnoxious, it's hard to bear.

Sheeler jumps, so shocked is she by his outburst, and so

humiliated for Lionel to witness it. Fighting tears and trying

to maintain her dignity, she gathers up her things and walks

to the door. Delbanco, immediately contrite, stands up.

She breaks into tears and rushes out of the office. Delbanco

is left facing Lionel, who gives him exactly the look the

doctor least wants to see.

INT. LILY'S CAFE - DAY

Mumford is eating his lunch at the counter. He watches Lily

busily working the midday rush. She sees him grinning at

her, but doesn't say anything for a while. Finally, blushing --

Mumford smiles, eats.

INT. ENTRY HALL, COOK HOUSE - NIGHT

Mr. Cook opens the front door to Mumford.

Mumford comes in, reluctantly.

INT. LIVING ROOM, COOK HOUSE - NIGHT

Mumford follows Mr. Cook into the room. Mrs. Cook and Sofie's

thirtyish brother, BEN, are in there, watching television.

Mrs. Cook keeps knitting; Ben stands to shake Mumford's hand,

muting the TV with a remote.

Mumford continues to stand.

Mumford sits.

Mumford's surprised. Mr. Cook speaks with some pleasure.

Mrs. Cook gives Ben a condescending look and keeps knitting.

Ben gives Mumford an exasperated look, but doesn't argue.

Mumford is conflicted, not sure what to share with them.

Mr. Cook and Ben exchange an alarmed glance. Mrs. Cook

actually cheers up.

Mumford looks from Ben to Mr. Cook, who nods his agreement.

Mumford looks at Mrs. Cook and can't stifle a laugh.

Mumford can't take his eyes off Mrs. Cook, even as he speaks

to Mr. Cook.

Mrs. Cook looks at him sharply. She's heard what the other

two have not.

EXT. SIDE STREET/ALLEY - DAY

Mumford carries a large Fed-Ex box down a side street and

into an alley. As he passes a secluded space created by two

adjacent buildings, something catches his eye.

MUMFORD'S MOVING POV: A young couple is embracing and talking

intimately. As they separate, we can see that it is Nessa

and Martin Brockett. Martin sees Mumford, but makes no sign.

Nessa twists to see what Martin's looking at just as the

view is interrupted by a wall.

Mumford walks on, mulling what he's seen.

EXT. BACK DOOR, FOLLETT'S PHARMACY - DAY

There is a locked security screen at the alley entrance to

the back room of the pharmacy, but the door inside is open.

When a YOUNG PHARMACIST appears in there, Mumford raps on

the metal screen.

INT. HENRY FOLLETT'S OFFICE - DAY

Follett's private space is above and at the back of his

drugstore. When you sit at his desk and in front of it, as

Follett and Mumford are doing now, you can see down into the

store through a floor-to-ceiling, one-way mirror.

The Fed-Ex box sits on the desk between the two men, unopened.

Mumford seems hesitant, but nods. Follett takes out an Exacto

knife and makes the first incision, but as he's about to go

on, Mumford suddenly reaches out and stops him.

Follett reacts. It's true, even if he keeps forgetting.

Mumford nods, but suddenly looks depressed, distracted.

He starts to take hold of the box.

Follett grabs the box back.

Follett stands up and grabs the box, taking sole possession.

Loud --

Mumford gives up. Follett gestures to ask whether it's safe

to put the box on the desk; Mumford reassures him. Now, with

much more anticipation and ceremony than before, Follett

carefully cuts open the package.

THE CONTENTS OF THE BOX is revealed as Follett opens the

flaps. There is an inner, brown paper wrapping upon which

has been set a low-rent catalogue: "METROPOLITAN COLLECTIBLES --

Periodicals, Erotica, Adult Nostalgia." Follett lifts away

the wrapping --

There are perhaps a dozen men's magazines of the late fifties

and early sixties: Nugget, Adam, The Adam Reader, Swank,

Dude. Plus several cartoon collections: Sex to Sexty, Stag

Humor. Plus trashy adult novels of the era, with provocative

illustrations on the covers: Night Call Nurse, The Neighbors

Have No Curtains, Secretarial Sluts, etc. Finally, two video

tapes, both of Russ Meyer films: MUDHONEY and COMMON-LAW

CABIN.

We stay CLOSE ON the contents of the box as Follett's hands

shuffle through it, rapidly flipping through the pages. Very

soft-core by today's standards, the common thread is clear:

voluptuous, heavy-breathing sirens in tight clothes (and out

of them) tempting muscular, he-man drifters or libidinous

businessmen. A world of lusty secretaries, siren babysitters,

and frustrated, neglected wives. In other words, exactly the

erotic ambience of Follett's fantasies.

SLOW TILT UP TO FOLLETT'S FACE. He is transported, mesmerized,

galvanized. In fact, at this moment, as the MUSIC SWELLS, a

tear is rolling down his cheek. He dare not take his eyes

from this Holy Grail to look up at Mumford. The only thing

that could wreck his mood now, is --

Follett jumps, startled from his revery. As the Young

Pharmacist steps tentatively into the office, Follett jams

everything back into the box as best he can and tries to

cover it.

The Young Pharmacist is cowed and doesn't advance into the

room.

It takes Follett a moment to understand, but when he does,

his whole manner changes. He dismisses the Young Pharmacist

with a nod, then gives a quick, self-conscious glance to

Mumford.

Follett heads for the door, pausing briefly at a mirror to

check his appearance, pushing at his hair with his palm.

He hurries out. Mumford stands up to leave, but first looks

down through the one-way mirror.

WHAT HE SEES: Follett hurries up behind the prescription

counter, where Althea Brockett is waiting; once again she

looks quite sexy. Follett brings her prescription up and

begins playfully flirting. Althea is responsive. Follett

motions Althea down the aisle, where it's more private. He

comes out from behind the counter, ostensibly to show Althea

something on the prescription bottle. Althea leans back

against some shelves in the same posture as the Landlady in

Follett's first fantasy.

Mumford reacts, bemused.

EXT. HIKING TRAIL - DAY

Mumford and Sofie make their way slowly up the trail. Despite

her labored breathing, it's clear Sofie has made enormous

progress since we first saw her.

Sofie gestures ahead.

Mumford slows at this. Sofie heads off the trail into the

woods.

EXT. BIG ROCK LOOKOUT POINT - DAY

Sofie appears first, but she waits for Mumford before she

steps tentatively onto the rock. Mumford takes firm hold of

her and leads her to a spot where she can securely settle

herself.

Mumford looks up, sharply.

She puts a hand on his arm.

He winces at her formality.

Mumford is in agony.

INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY

Nessa's on the couch, playing with her usual unlit cigarette.

There's an uncharacteristic lightness to her.

Mumford laughs, delighted.

She holds up the cigarette as though it were her middle

finger, flipping the bird.

Mumford doesn't have to see her face to know how much pleasure

this gives her, despite her hard-ass cover.

She takes a look at her watch and immediately lights her

cigarette as she stands up --

She heads toward the waiting room. Mumford gestures to

indicate the back door. She waves him off. He shakes his

head -- no one wants to use the back anymore.

Nessa opens the door to the waiting room. Martin Brockett is

sitting there. He makes a gesture to Nessa to underline the

fact that he is not reading any of the many magazines lying

around, then stands up. She goes into his arms like maybe

she's the puppy. He beams and looks at Mumford.

Nessa give him an affectionate punch in the side, then blows

smoke in his face.

Nessa gives Mumford an embarrassed, "ain't he corny?" look,

but as they go out the door, she's never looked happier.

Mumford is startled to find a man in a suit, GILROY, rising

from the chair behind the door. He's got a briefcase and a

document in his hand.

He proffers the document in his hand, but Mumford doesn't

take it.

Gilroy stops, outside door already open.

He goes out. Mumford considers the paper in his hands,

thoughts elsewhere.

INT. MUMFORD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

CLOSE ON A PACKING CARTON half full of books. PULLING BACK

and FLOATING OVER other boxes, half-packed with Mumford's

personal belongings -- he doesn't have a lot. On the bed, an

open suitcase with a few clothes thrown in. We're STILL MOVING

across the room and out onto the porch, to REVEAL Mumford in

his chair, nursing a beer, looking up at the starry sky.

Mumford HEARS THE SHOWER GO ON downstairs at Lily's. Then

the MURMUR AND GIGGLE of a wet couple.

Mumford smiles. He gets up and goes inside, closing the door

behind him so as not to violate their privacy. He goes to

the suitcase, takes out some clothes and begins putting them

back in the dresser. Right now, he's not going anywhere.

INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY

EXTREME CLOSE-UP of Ernest Delbanco. We can't tell where he

is at first. As he speaks, we PULL BACK to REVEAL him lying

on Mumford's couch -- a patient.

Across the room, Mumford sits, chin in hand, displaying no

reaction.

This next is painful for Delbanco.

Mumford digests this.

Mumford's head snaps up. He had no idea Delbanco was married.

EXT. GAS STATION, SMALL TOWN (IN HENRY FOLLETT'S FANTASY) -

DAY

We (CAMERA) are being pummelled by three SMALL TOWN TOUGHS

behind Old Man Sutter's gas station/diner in the Follett's

fantasy town. [In BLACK & WHITE.] Beyond them, Old Man

Sutter's stacked YOUNG WIFE watches in horror from the

backdoor of the building. We DO NOT SEE The Newcomer yet.

One of the Toughs winds up and delivers the coup de grace.

CUT TO BLACK, then FADE UP ON:

INT. ATTIC ROOM, BOARDING HOUSE - DAY

STILL IN SUBJECTIVE CAMERA as the concerned Landlady, cleavage

foremost, stands away from us, having patted the unseen

Newcomer's face with a washcloth. Beyond her, near the half-

open door, stands her Cheerleader Daughter, worriedly chewing

on her thumb.

CUT TO REVERSE and see the hero, who this time is actually

played by Henry Follett, appearing in his own fantasy for

the first time. He's lying in bed, his face bruised in the

manner of a fifties movie.

BACK AT THE DOOR, the Cheerleader hears someone coming and

steps aside to make way for -- Althea Brockett, dressed now

in a nurse's uniform so tight the buttons are straining.

As the Landlady and the Cheerleader retreat out the door,

Althea the Nurse sways forward toward the bed bearing bandages

and a bowl of steaming water, a lascivious look of concern

on her face.

Althea the Nurse places a bandage over Follett's eyes,

BLACKING OUT THE SCENE.

INT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - (PRESENT) DAY

Mumford sits beaming at Henry Follett on the couch. Mumford's

glance takes in the clock and he stands up, signalling the

end of the session. Follett snaps out of his revery and gets

up.

Mumford, surprisingly, takes Follett's hand and shakes it

vigorously.

Mumford stops him with a "don't mention it" gesture. Follett

accepts and goes out the back door. Mumford is pleased someone

still wants to use that door.

Mumford returns to his desk and begins reading some papers

when he HEARS the entry door to the waiting room. Not

expecting anyone, he checks the clock, then goes to his office

door and opens it.

Sofie is standing there, very agitated, just about to knock.

She peers past him to see if he's alone.

Sofie sits on the couch. Mumford sits in his chair, facing

her. Her voice is as strained as her manner.

Mumford waits.

Mumford considers a long moment, several scenarios racing

through his mind. Finally, carefully --

Sofie suddenly finds it difficult to look into his eyes, she

looks around frenetically for a moment. Then, indicating the

couch --

Mumford gestures "of course." Sofie swings her legs up and

lies on the couch so they can no longer see each other's

face. (It's the most vigorous movement she's yet shown us.)

This seems to help Sofie a bit.

Mumford appears frozen in his chair. There is a heavy silence

in the room. Sofie does not look back there.

Suddenly, Sofie's voice cracks. She is starting to cry, but

refuses to acknowledge it.

Mumford doesn't know what to say. He's on the rack. Finally --

Silence. Then Sofie gets up, wiping at tears with the back

of her bare hand. Mumford jumps up to offer her a tissue,

but she ignores it. She will not meet his gaze.

Sofie turns to go out through the waiting room, but after a

step, she stops, pirouettes and goes out the back.

EXT. THE DUPLEX HOUSE - MAGIC

Mumford comes up the street, lost in thought, and turns into

the driveway toward his stairs. Ainge leaps over the front

yard fence. Mumford pets the dog distractedly, still moving.

Lily rises up suddenly from where she's been working in the

garden.

Mumford reluctantly stops. Lily comes up to the fence.

Mumford leans down to pet Ainge.

Mumford straightens, looks at Lily and acknowledges it.

Mumford looks at Lily a long moment, then leans over the

fence and kisses her on the forehead. Ainge jumps back over

to her side.

Mumford turns and continues toward his stairs.

INT. MUMFORD'S APARTMENT - MAGIC

Mumford comes in, drops his coat, gets a carton of orange

juice out of the fridge and drinks directly from it.

Distracted, he picks up the remote from the kitchen counter

and switches on the TV, then opens his freezer and stares

inside.

UNSOLVED MYSTERIES comes on. The opening segment previews a

story about a couple who claim to have had a visitation from

Gianni Versace, then one about a yacht that went down near

Venezuela. ROBERT STACK, in his characteristic fragmented

delivery, intones the preview for the last story, accompanied

by appropriate footage:

A CLOSE-UP of an IRS identification card featuring a picture

of a younger Mumford, badly photographed in suit and tie.

His name is not visible.

In the kitchen, Mumford spins to look. DISSOLVE TO:

LATER IN THE PROGRAM. Documentary shots of IRS Headquarters,

etc., are INTERCUT with hokey-looking re-enactments from

Mumford's life -- with a YOUNG ACTOR who looks vaguely like

Mumford playing him.

IN MUMFORD'S APARTMENT the telephone is RINGING. Clearly,

it's not the first time. Mumford, watching the show intently,

lifts the headset an inch from the cradle and then hangs up.

When it immediately RINGS AGAIN, Mumford takes it off the

hook, cuts off the call, and buries the headset under a sofa

cushion.

ON THE SHOW: scenes of tax investigation -- in the show's

version the IRS guys have drawn guns and are storming houses --

are interspersed with scenes of sordid drug-taking.

MUMFORD'S SISTER, the real thing, a plain, middle-aged West

Virginia woman, appears in a "dramatic", badly-lit interview.

(As with all the interviewees, she is identified by a supered

title.)

A snapshot of some IRS-era party, happy revelers posing for

a flash. Camera PUSHES IN on Mumford, smiling and high, his

neck encircled by Gregory's arm. Candy is on the other side

of Gregory.

A shot of the Pennsylvania Turnpike as a State Police Cruiser

zips by.

GREGORY, in State Police uniform, with a sadistic glint in

his eye, is interviewed by the roadside, cars whipping by.

Ragged telephoto shots of the Drug Rehab Center in the desert,

low, innocuous adobe buildings.

IN AN ARIZONA TOWN, a monk with a clerical collar, BROTHER

TIMOTHY, is loading groceries into the back of a pick-up.

He's being ambush interviewed. He's polite, but not

cooperative.

Shots of wind-swept desert, cactus, and dust-blown highway.

MUMFORD'S SISTER AGAIN:

Mumford, in his apartment, watches with real emotion.

His sister's face DISSOLVES into a new snapshot of Mumford,

dressed in an Orkin Exterminator uniform, as the MUSIC on

the show comes up. A 1-800 telephone number appears across

the bottom of the frame.

EXT. SECOND FLOOR PORCH, THE DUPLEX HOUSE - NIGHT

Mumford comes out to the rail and looks off over the town of

Mumford.

WHAT HE SEES (or imagines he sees): all across the nightscape,

one window in every house is glowing blue with flickering TV

light.

EXT. COOK HOUSE - NIGHT

MOVING IN on the porch steps. Mumford runs into the shot. In

fact, he's run the whole way from his place and he's out of

breath. He takes the porch steps three at a time, rings the

doorbell, and waits.

Mrs. Cook peeks out, then opens the front door, an especially

sour look on her face. She speaks through the screen door.

Mrs. Cook glances inside at the as-yet-unseen Sofie, then

hisses at Mumford --

Sofie appears behind her mother.

Both Sofie and Mrs. Cook are set back for a moment. Mrs.

Cook recovers fastest --

Mr. Cook suddenly appears, takes Mrs. Cook by the arm and

makes her vanish. Sofie and Mumford are left alone. She looks

at him through the screen.

Sofie comes outside. She doesn't get too close or look at

him as she walks to the other end of the porch.

Mumford knows.

Sofie turns sharply to look at him, ready to blow up.

Mumford agrees. He watches her closely.

Mumford immediately perks up. Sofie tries to correct --

Mumford steps closer to her.

She looks into his eyes.

She regards him for several moments, her mind racing.

Mumford feels joy. Now, finally, he takes her in his arms.

As Mumford breaks into a huge grin, CUT TO:

INT. COURTROOM, MUMFORD COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY

Mumford is at the defense table. Lionel is his lawyer. Sofie,

Mr. Cook and Ben sit right behind the rail.

Mumford and Lionel stand up.

Lionel sits down, squelched again. We see JUDGE OTTO for the

first time, a tough guy in his sixties.

WE SEE there's a pretty big turnout for this hearing.

Prominent among the onlookers: Lily and Skip, sitting

together; Nessa and Martin, holding hands; Dr. Delbanco and

MRS. DELBANCO. Gilroy, from the State Certification Board,

sits with the PROSECUTOR.

Follett is sitting in one of the back rows, apparently alone.

But now he looks down the row. Althea is sitting down at the

end in a stylish suit, completely appropriate, but a size

too small.

She gives Follett a sidelong glance, then crosses her legs

provocatively. Whatever fantasy they're currently enacting

is working really well for both of them.

The judge slams down his gavel, stands up and stalks out. A

DEPUTY moves in to take custody of Mumford. Lionel stands up

and leans in --

Mumford turns to face the Cooks. Mr. Cook and Ben shake his

hand like he's just won something. Lionel addresses them all

with his usual self-satisfaction --

WE PUSH IN on Mumford and Sofie, who embrace.

They kiss. The Deputy takes Mumford's arm, and we --

INT. STATE CORRECTIONAL SEDAN - DAY

Mumford is alone in the backseat, handcuffed to a metal

restraint. A lone COUNTY CORRECTIONAL OFFICER is up front,

driving. There's a heavy security screen divider between

front and back.

They ride along in silence. At peace, Mumford watches the

town go by. Finally --

The Correctional Officer watches Mumford in the rear view

mirror, waiting hopefully. Mumford ponders the question a

long time, then gives a "what the hell" shrug.

EXT. MAIN STREET, EDGE OF TOWN - DAY

The State Correctional Sedan heads out of the business

district toward the highway, leaving the town of Mumford

behind.

FADE OUT.
