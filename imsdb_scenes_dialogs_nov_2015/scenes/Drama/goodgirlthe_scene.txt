(v.o.) As a girl, you see the world

like a giant candy store, filled with

sweet candy and such. But one day you

look around and see a prison and you're

on death row. You wanna run, or scream

or cry. But something's locking you

up. Are the other folks cows, chewing

cud till the hour come and their heads

roll? Or are they just keeping quiet,

like you... Planning their escape?

On your left, honey.

What's that cashier's name?

Can't say.

When did he start working here?

Don't know. Yesterday?

Who is he?

Don't know. Can't say.

What are you doing?

It's called work, princess. Kind of

fun. You might want to give it a go

someday.

Attention, shoppers. There's a Retail

Rodeo special on aisle three. Liquid

drain cleaner. Two 12-ounce cans for

$5. Liquid drain cleaner has churning

power and will churn right through your

pipes. Ladies, shove something clean

and new up your filthy pipes. Liquid

drain cleaner on aisle three. Have a

good day and thank you for shopping

at Retail Rodeo.

Hey, Justine. Can I talk to you for

a second?

Yeah.

I was just curious. Have you ever been

to a Bible study?

Yeah.

We got a good one going on every Wednesday

at the First Church of Nazarine. Rodney

comes, Benita comes. You got any interest

in reading the Bible?

I have my own, you know, beliefs.

We don't preach fire and brimstone.

Just the Ten Commandments. Were not

interested in scaring people. Were

about loving Jesus.

I kinda like my nights to myself.

Well, maybe you'll have nights of eternal

hellfire to yourself. Just kidding you.

Drive safe.

Bye-bye.

Hey, Justine.

Hey, Teeny. How was your day?

The same. How was yours?

The wind was flipping paint in our eyes.

Paint stings. Feel like I've been attacked

by hornets in my eyeballs.

Bubba, stand up.

Why?

For Christ's sakes. Look at that couch,

Phil. Y'all got paint all over it. This

ain't gonna come off. Damn it, Phil.

...including this gorgeous eggplant...

I think we got most of it out.

You two were stoned. You, keep frying

your brain liike that, you'll slip off

a ladder and crack open your head bone.

You do really stupid things when you're

high, Phil.

Like what?

Like sitting on my couch with your big

blue ass. Everything just turns to shit.

You finally get nice things, then everything

just gets messed up. Why is this TV

buzzing?

It's the wind doing that. They the wind's

coming in different lately.

Different from what?

What you reading?

Catcher in the Rye I'm named after

it.

What's your name? Catcher?

Holden. After Holden Caulfield. He's

the main character.

What's he do?

He's put upon by society. Hypocrisy

of the world.

I notice that you're, uh, not very social.

I'm a writer.

What do you write?

Novels, plays, screenplays, stories,

poetry.

(to costumer) That's good. Justine will

be right with you. Where is she?

I better go. What happens at the end

of your book?

Oh, he has a nervous breakdown. Goes

to a mental hospital.

You don't get paid to pick your crack.

You get paid to work.

I'm not sure I can do makeovers.

Oh, come on! A little pancake, eyeliner,

mascara, rouge on the cheeks and powder

it up. Then you take a moist tissue,

roll it in a ball and toss it in their

face! Jeez, Louise... I'm talking to a

tree stump! Girl, where are you?!

Sorry, Im just a little tired.

It's the food you eat, Justine. Look

at me. I am 10 years older than you

and have 10 times your energy. Cause

I don't eat meat and I don't eat dairy.

It's probably why you can't get pregnant,

honey. And why you have that hung-jaw

look on your face. It's the cheese in

your pizza and the chicken in your salad.

I went to the doctor. He says I'm fertile.

He says I could repopulate the entire

planet.

Then what's the deal here? Did he say

you get enough vitamins?

He didn't say.

You could make paint where, at different

angles, the house is different colours.

You stand at the front door and the

house is red. You stand at the street

and the house is green. Or you could

make, like, an invisible paint. Make

the whole house disappear.

What would be really neat is a paint

that could change the molecular structure

of a house, like a chemical acid deal.

What do you think, Teeny?

I think you two are a pair of potheads.

You getting a whole one of these or

a half?

That oneright there.

You didn't bring this into the store?

No.

Well then, I'll charge you for it. This

is a hand lotion. So don't put it anywhere

else, even if you need lubrication.

We try to keep frivolous lawsuits to

a minimum, unless, ofcourse, the customer

is at fault. Here's your change and

Fuck you very much.

Excuse me?

Thank you very much.

Good as new, I'll tell ya, good as new.

Now, you might be interested in purchasing

some of the products I used today...

Oh, I'm not buying anything today.

Well, that'd be a mistake. These are

bargain prices.

I didn't bring my purse.

I hate my job.

That makes two of us.

I hate everyone here. I hate Gwen. I

don't know what the hell she's so happy

about. I'm sorry I don't understand

why maniacs get shotguns and shoot everybody

to pieces.

Maybe you're a maniac.

Maybe so. You know you're lips are real

pouty, like a woman. And how your eyes

droop off to the side. How old are you?

Twenty two.

I'm an old lady next to you.

How old are you?

How old do you think?

I don't know.

I am thirty years old.

How long you been workin' here for?

Forever and a day!

You don't have a car?

Oh, I live right down the street.

Well, you can ride in here, there's

room.

You wanna come in?

I don't know. I'm in a funk.

Well, I'm not gonna beg ya.

I'll be in my room.

Okay, Tom.

They call you Tom?

It's my slave name. Holden's what I

call myself. This is my room.

Not aolt to look at. What are your folks

like?

They're okay. They don't get me. I mean,

they're alright.

My husband doesn't get me.

Since when do you have a husband?

Since seven years. He's a painter.

What's he paint?

Houses. He's a pig. He talks but he

doesn't think. You go to college?

Um, I had to drop out. I had a problem

with drinkin' and stuff. I'll go back.

I just gotta prove to my parents that

I can fly staright. You go to college?

No, I was afraid I'd lose Phil if I

went. Now that'd be reason enough to

go. I saw you in the store and I liked

how you kept to yourself. I can see

in your eyes that you hate the world.

I hate it too. You know what I'm talkin'

about?

After livin in the dark for so long

a glimspe of the light can make you

giddy. Strange thought come into your

head and you'd better think 'em. Has

a special fate been callin' you and

you not listenin? Is there a secret

message right in front you, and you're

not reading it? Is this your last, best

chance? Are you gonna take it? Or are

you goin' to the grave with unlived

lives in your vains?

Teeny, you're pretty. Bubba, isn't Teeny

pretty?

I've seen better, I've seen worse. Nah.

That's why I ain't never married. You

got yourself the best fish in the sea.

I wonder what it'd be like to be a woman.

All that smooth skin and long hair.

If I was a woman, I'd be a slut. A lesbian

slut.

Gwen says smokin' marijuana lowers your

sperm.

Lowers it to where?

Maybe you're the infertile one 'round

here. Maybe every time you smoke a little

dooby, you're killin' our unborn children.

Alright, close.

Why you limping.

I twisted up my ankle on the stairs.

I was wonderin', maybe you could give

me a ride home?

Yeah, sure okay.

Alright I'll talk to you about it later.

All I know is, everyone should have

one beau, before anyone has two beaus.

He's not my beau, he's my friend.

Happy Halloween Retail Rodeo shoppers!

There's a Retail Rodeo special on all

bulk candy on aisle four. Ghouls and

goblins, witches and warlocks, wandering

these aisles, day after day. I'll put

a Halloween curse on you.

Night Corny. Happy Halloween.

Well I'm not a pagen but thanks all

the same.

Which ankle did you twist, Holden?

My, uh, left.

Maybe you should put some cold water

on it so it doesn't sweel up and inflame.

Okay.

You're a writer so you have yourself

a goal. I used to lie in bed and imagine

other cities, other jobs I could have.

Other husbands. Now I don't even know

what to imagine anymore. Holden, I have

a husband.

You said he was a pig.

Well, Holden. I don't want to hurt anybody.

I was thinking about what you were sayin'

about my sperm bein' low. I mean, I

know I got good sperm. It's baby-makin

sperm. I suppose it couldn't hurt to

have it confirmed by an expert.

Oh who gives a shit, who needs a F&$%'

baby around here anyways? If you wanna

make yourself useful, why don't you

get that goddamn TV fixed?!

What the hell?

It sounds like a helicopter is landin'

in here.

You want a blackberry, honey? A man

was sellin' 'em on the road.

No thank you.

This is for you Justine. It's from Holden.

Well where is he?

He's got the day off. He came by this

morning with it.

Thanks.

Don't mention it. Hey, Gwen.

Hey sugar.

Dear Justine. Because of you I'll be

quitting the Retail Rodeo. The last

two days have been the most god-awful

days of my life. I've not been able

to get rid of you in my head. I never

wanted anything so bad, and I have wanted

many things. I'd given up long ago on

being gotten by someone else, and then

you came along. The idea of being gotten,

because of circumstance, will never

get got is the worst feeling I've ever

felt, and I have felt many bad feelings.

I'm sorry I can never see you again,

Justine, forgive me for being so weak,

but that is who I am. Goodbye, Holden

Wurther. If for some reason, you could

change your mind and want to be with

me, body and soul, meet me after work.

I will be waiting for you at five PM

outside Chuck E.Cheese. If you are not

there at five, you will never see me

in your lifetime.

Gwen? What's wrong?

Gwen? Gwen you sick?

Justine? Justine what's goin' on in

here? Gwen, you sick? We gotta get her

to a hospital. Justine you drive her.

Well what time is it?

It's aquarter to five. Why, you gotta

be somewhere?

Gwen?

Oh, I had a dream. I had dream that

I sprouted a beard made of bean sprouts.

I'm gonna let you off here, okay?

Okay,You'll meet me inside?

Yeah, you know what I'm gonna do? I'm

gonna park the car, then I'm gonna meet

you inside.

Okay. Your a doll.

Hey. Oh god, I'm really glad you came.

I just ditched Gwen at the hospital.

Oh god, thank god.

Where are we goin'?

Let's go to my house.

No, with your folks there?

Let's just park somewhere.

This isn't well planned.

Look. I don't know. I don't care I just

wanna hold you.

That's fourty five dollars even. And

I need you to fill this out for me.

I can't do it.

We'll be back here before you know it.

I don't wanna... I don't wanna go.

Justine. I'm yours. I'm all yours.

Hey.

Hey.

Were you been?

Gwen got real sick today. She was throwin'

up all over the store. I had to take

her to the hositpal, and sat with her.

Did she sick up on you?

No.

Did she sick up on anybody? (chuckles)

It's not funny, Phil, this is serious.

I'm gonna go up there tomorrow too.

And the next day.

Justine? What happened to you?

What?

I went down to St. Catherine's to check

up on Gwen. I looked all over for you,

she was askin' for you.

Well, how is she?

She was heavin' up until there was nothin'

left to heave. Doctor said she must've

eaten somethin' with some kind of parasite

in it or somethin'.

I bet it was those blackberries.

They're gonna keep her in there until

she gets better so you're gonna have

to supervise cosmetics.

Stop it, somebody's gonna see!

Who cares, I don't care. I crave you.

I wanna know everything about you. Who

are you?

I'm just this woman. I moved to Texas

when I was eleven. My daddy was in the

Air Force.

I wanna knock open your head and see

what's inside. I've had so much pain

in my life. I know you have too, I can

see it.

Holden gave me two of his stories to

read. It's like what a story would be.

I was about a boy who was put upon,

his mother was cold and selfish, and

his father wanted him to play football.

Other people didn't get him, especially

girls. Then the boy comes to believe

no one can ever really know him. So

he starts actin' out, drinkin', and

doin' all kinds of drugs. At the end

the boy kills himself but jumpin' over

abridge. The second story was pretty

much the same as the first. Except at

the end, the boy kills himself by drinkin'

a bottle of bug poison.

Your stories are intense.

I just wanna leave some kind of legacy.

Somethin' great. After that I don't

care what happens to me.

Don't say that. I wish there was a story

about me. I don't know who would read

it though.

I would.

I like this. I like havin' a secret.

You gave me a secret Holden.

Seee, now that you met me you're mysterious.

And dark and twisted.

I'm going to hell, aren't I?

Yes, you are.

That's Bubba's truck. Get in the car.

Phil takes that truck to work everyday.

Bubba picks him up, and drops him off.

Why, why would that truck be parked

there?

I don't know.

If he finds out about us....

I won't let him hurt you.

He's big, Holden. He'll kill you. He'll

beat me, but he'll kill you.

You can't worry about somethin' that

hasn't even happened yet.

I gotta go to the hospital.

Okay. (leans in to kiss her; she pulls

away)

Don't! I mean he could be followin'

us.

Justine! Poor lady. She just passed.

Who?

Gwen! She just passed away.

What do you mean? I thought she had

a stomach ache?

It got worse. She was on life support

all day.

I don't understand.

It's God's will, Justine. No one can

understand it. It was just Gwen's time

to fly away home.

Gwen died today.

What? Are you kiddin? What for?

Parasite. Somethin' she ate.

You okay?

Where were you this afternoon?

Paintin' on Bovery. Why?

What time did Bubba bring you home?

We knocked off early 'bout four. Bubba

had a date with a stewardess, why?

Oh. I can't believe she's dead. I wasn't

a very good friend to her.

Don't say that, Teeny. 'Course you were.

'Course you were.

Retail Rodeo employees this is Jack

Fields, your store manager. Before we

open today, I just want to share some

terrible and shocking news. One of our

best employees, Gwen Jackson, died yesterday.

Gwen was a real class act. She had a

good attitude, she had ideas. We're

all gonna miss her. Now, if any of y'all

need to collect you thoughts and remember

Gwen. GWEN, then today's the day. You'll

be excused from work and we'll just

have to do without you. Gwen, this one's

for you.

Holden had the notion to go to Gabler's

Creek, skinny dippin' and makin' love.

He said we'd be like Adam and Eve, rollin'

around around in the sticks and the

dirt and bein' one with nature. He was

so fixed on the idea thateven when the

clouds started rollin' in, and the sky

was gettin; dark, he kept on swimmin'.

All my thoughts turned to death. I thought

of Gwen's body, rottin' away. I thought

of how nice a person she was, so full

of life and good will. If there was

a heaven, Gwen would be there. Givin'

makeovers and offerin' up helpful advice.

I thought if I died today, what would

happen to me? A hateful girl. A selfish

girl. An adultress. A liar.

What are we doin'?

Makin' one out of two.

(sighs) I haven't thought this through.

Justine, will you leave him?

And go where?

Away. With you on my arm, my folks'll

think I've changed. They'll stop thinkin'

I'm suck a loner, I got a girlfriend,

a pretty one, who knows me and likes

me. And they'll be so happy, they'll

give me money to write my novel.

But where will we GO?

We'll be like... Catcher in the Rye.

Only by me. I'll be immortal and then

like JD Salinger I'll just vanish.

Hey, Teeny. We've been up to no good.

We got the day off on account of the

rain.

I thought you might.

So I heard about your friend bein' dead,

and all. I'm sorry.

Yeah. She was real healthy too.

Well, at least you were with her when

she went. (intense voice and look) Ain't

that right? You were... with her, when

she went?

Yeah.

Oh, I wish it would rain every day from

here on out. Never have to paint again.

Hey Justine. How you holding up?

Fine.

Real shocker. I decided to move Cheryl

over to cosmetics. She got a little

too creative on the P.A. Maybe she'll

watch her P's and Q's over here. If

not she's out on her but. Now you listen

to Justine, sister.

You want me to help you get stuff out

of storage?

Not right now, maybe later.

Well, are you gonna give me a ride home?

My ankle's actin' up.

I gotta get home. Maybe Cheryl can.

What, you need a ride?

Forget it.

I think we gotta take a breather. I'm

nervous.

Well, can't we go to the motel?

Not today.

Well, let's go in the store room.

Just be patient, Holden!

I was wonderin', when was that, uh,

bible study?

Tomorrow night at eight. We'd love to

have ya.

Can I bring my husband?

'Course! A couple that prays together

stays together.

What's this?

The Holy Bible. There's one for you,

and one for me.

Not very light is it?

We're goin' to Bible study. A couple

that prays together, stays together.

I heard it was the couple that lays

together stays together.

Well you heard wrong.

Cheryl? You think you can take this

one?

Sure... Sit right down here ma'am, we're

gonna make you pretty. Now how do you

like your hair?

Wait, you gonna do my hair?

No, I just need to know if that's your

usual way of wearing it all big and

high. If it is then I'll just put more

makeup on your chin to off-set. Now,

you're gonna want to take a whole bottle

of this home wtih you. It's got quite

alot of ingredients in it so you're

getting a good deal. It's got Ginco

extract in it, do you know what that

is?

No.

It's extract of the Ginco and it makes

your skin real slick so that any liquid

will roll right off, be it water or

lemon juice or urine. I'll put that

in a bag for you.

Phil, what the hell are you doin'? We're

gonna be late for Bible study. You're

stoned, you got paint in your hair,

would you just get in the shower?

I completely didn't remember...

Get in the shower.

Workin' on your spiritual life?

Yeah, I guess.

Ain't that a hoot and a holler.

What do you mean?

I saw you, Justine.

Saw me what?

I saw you. We got some things to talk

about, you and me. You come by my place

after work. If you knwo what's good

for ya.

Hey. Where's Bubba?

He left.

Well, I'm ready. Let's go.

I don't know what to say about Jesus.

I'm stoned.

Just let the other people do the talking.

Jeez. We forgot the Bibles, Justine.

Well, that's alright, they'll forgive

us.

Hi. Welcome. Hey there people! Glad

you could make it!

Hi Corny. This is my husband, Phil.

Y'all are in for a treat. We got a good

discussion going tonight. If man is

made in God's image, what does that

say about God?

Yeah, that sounds like a good one.

Phil, come with me to the car.

What?

Come with me to the car, I gotta get

somethin'.

What's goin' on?

Just get in the car. Get in the car,

Phil.

What the hell?

I don't want to go to Bible study.

Why not?

Because I don't want to. Now, can we

please just get out of here?

Justine, this is embarassing. We're

runnin' away from Bible study like a

couple of Devil worshippers.

I don't care. I'm not in the mood.

You are freakin' me out, man. Why?

Why? Beacause we forgot our Bibles is

why.

You just said a few minutes ago they'll

forgive us.

Yeah, well, they may not, alright. So

can we please just get the shit outta

here?

I'm never goin' back to Bible study

again.

I don't care, fine by me.

I think I look too white, don't you

think?

I'm just tryin' to match your face with

your hair, I was thinkin' you're not

white enough.

I think I look kinda wierd.

Well, the first rule of fashion is that

you have to look wierd. What I'm doing

here has come straight from France.

Oh.

It's called circ du face, meaning circus

of the face and it's all the rage with

the Frenchies.

Well, you're the professoinal.

That's right.

Justine, what happened to you? I looked

up and I saw you two drivin' off like

vampires in the night.

Oh geez, we forgot our Bibles.

You coulda looked off your neighbor.

It's a church, you know. You can't make

water without bumpin' your nut on a

bible.

Oh. Well, we felt bad.

(looks at the customer) What in blazes?!

Do you like it?

I can't go.

What?

I can't go today. There's something

important I need to tend to.

I thought you said we'd go today.

Well, something came up.

What came up?

Um, okay. I think, maybe, somebody's

found out about us.

I'm starting to wonder if you even want

to go. I'm startin' to think you don't

get me.

Well, maybe I don't get you.

You do, you do get me you just don't

want to me 'cause I'm too intensified

for you! Justine, who cares, who cares

if someone finds out. We don't have

to live like this, Justine. I know what

it's like to go home every night and

feel like you're hidin' out. We can

leave all this behind...

That's easy for you to say, Holden,

you are not married.

You just, you just gonna give up?! You

gonna go crawlin' back?!

Holden, you are gonna get us caught!

You're so fucking afraid it makes me

sick. Don't give up on us.

I won't.

I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Okay?

Okay. Good luck on your important thing.

Thanks.

Easy Bitz, easy Bitz. Back in your corner!

Back in your corner! Back in your corner,

Bitz! Come on in. I wanna show you somethin'.

Sit. (Yells at dog again) I'm in shock.

Why?

You know why.

Bubba sat like that for what seemed

like ten years before he began to speak.

Finally, when he opened his mouth, he

talked a blue streak about the ruin

that was his life. He talked about how

he loved Phil, and how he loved me.

And how he always wanted a girlfriend

just like me, and to be a guy like Phil,

to this imaginary girl like me, that

he never found. Then he wen on about

givin' up your dreams and how it's all

a part of gettin' older. Bubba had given

up on his dream to be like Phil, and

accepted his fate as Bubba, always and

forever. Then, last week, a door that

remained shut swung wide open. Bubba

thought this no chance coincidence,

a cosmic force was at work. The sounds

of me makin' love to a man that wasn't

Phil was like a shout in Bubba's ear

from the creator himself. What it meant,

or what to do, or why Bubba didn't know.

All he knew was that he hated me for

poisoning the well of idealism that

he had drunk from for so long. I was

no longer Bubba's image of perfection.

To him I was just a liar, and a whore,

and that sickened him. But on the other

hand he loved me for opening his eyes

and releasing him from the bitter chains

of evny that bound him to Phil. Phil

was no superman, just a cuckhold, and

a foll, and that was beautiful. Bubba

felt that there was just one thing left

for us to do. Something that would solve

both our problems and end this whole

tragic cycle.

Bubba, I am not gonna sleep with you.

But don't you see? This is my chance,

for liberation.

But, one person's liberation is another

person's, well, badness. There's just

no way.

I'm gonna have to tell Phil then.

Why?

He's my best friend. I can't keep him

in the dark about somethin' this big.

He's a cuckhold.

You wanna cuckhold him yourself!

Well that's different. That isn't about

him. That's about my salvation. Look,

you've got your choice to make. Either

destroy your marriage, and break your

husband's heart. Or have sex with me

right now.

Oh god! There was someone in the window!

Did you not see?

You're paranoid.

I gotta go.

Phil is never gonna find out about any

of this. Don't fret. (the dog is still

barking)

Get this damn dog away from me!

You're lookin' at a free man, Justine.

A free man.

Great. Good for you.

Thank you. (Yelling at dog again.)

I'm nervous.

You're nervous? Why?

'Cause I gotta go to that doctor tomorrow

and jism into a cup, that's why. What

if I can't do it?

You can do it.

You know, If you said you'd help me

I'd feel alot less nervous. It's gonna

be on your lunch hour anyway.

Okay.

You didn't even say nothing about the

TV bein' fixed.

Oh. Is it? Thanks.

You're welcome.

Well aren't you a fright? Justine, you

talked to Holden lately? He didn't show

up for work today, I wanna know what

gives. I know you two are friends.

We're not friends.

You eat lunch together every day.

No, we don't.

Well, if you see him, tell him Jack

Fields is lookin' for him.

Oh my god. What are you doin'?

You're a hooker, you hooker.

I saw you. You followed me.

So, how many guys you gettin' with?

You gettin' with every guy in the state?

No, Holden, this is all because of you.

He had me over a barrel. If I didn't

sleep with him he was gonna tell Phil

about us!

I'm so alone!

You've gotta get a hold of yourself!

Are you drunk?

Yes, I'm drunk! And I'll be drunk every

day until the day I die! What do you

care?! You jump on any pecker that's

put in front of you!

It's not what you think.

I saw everything. Oh god. Oh god.

Look, go home. Sober up. And meet me

after work.

Where you goin'?

I gotta help Phil with his sperm.

What?

Just go. Go!

I can't share you, Justine! Maybe with

one man but not with a whole bunch of

'em!

Great.

Mr. Last? Would you come with me?

Wish me luck.

Good luck, honey.

Knock 'em dead, partner. (Justine and

Bubba watch Phil walk into one of the

rooms) You look nice.

No, I don't.

I know you're angry and I can figure

why. But, from where I stand, what happened

yesterday was a wonderful thing.

Nothin' happened yesterday, so drop

it.

Well, I'm awful grateful to ya, Justine.

Bubba, I mean it.

Let me just ask you one thing. How do

I stack up against Phil? You know, how

do I stack up where it counts?

Ma'am? Your husband asked me to request

for your presence.

Who's there?

It's Justine. (gets into the room)

C'mon. I can't do this on my own. I

need help.

You've never done it on your own?

Not in a place like this! Not where

I have to hand over the results! Just,

let me hold your boob.

Ah, they're sore. (Justine looks fed

up with everything)

What's wrong with you? You look like

death.

My stomach's crampin'. I feel sore.

Is it your period?

Nah, it's stress.

This job is stressful. I'm breaking

out.

You're breakin' out 'cause you put so

much makeup on your face.

Maybe you're pregnant.

What?... No... (thinks about it)

You know, sometimes, I think to myself,

at least it can't get any worse. But

it can. I can worse. As long as you

can say you've hit rock bottom you can.

Oh my god, Blackberries.

A blind man can go deaf. A widow can

lose her children. Babies starve and

they never get food. They never get

any food. They just come into the world

and they die.

Calm down, Holden!

I can't calm down! I'd be easy if I

was a hooker like you. I could calm

down all over town.

Hey, hey! I am not a hooker.

I know you're not. I'm in agony.

Why?

What do you mean 'why'? I thought you

hated your life.

I do. I mean I'm depressed but... You

are really depressed.

I'll kill him. I'll murder him in his

sleep. I'll kill my parents, I'll steal

the money whatever it takes. You just,

just whatever you want as long as it's

you and me. Please don't forsake me

Justine.

Oh... I, I promise. (car is parked somewhere;

Justine and Holden are sitting on the

car, Holden's smoking)

I realized then that Holden was at best

a child, and at worst a demon. If I

was ever gonna go straight I'd have

to ditch him. Sometimes, to get back

on the road to redemption, you have

to make a few pit stops.

How much are the blackberries?

A tin for two dollars, miss. (gives

her the blackberries) There you go.

Thank you.

Have a blackberry.

We need a plan. We can't keep livin'

day to day. We gotta chart a course

and we just gotaa stick....

Have a blackberry, Holden!

But, they're dirty. (hesitating, he

eats a blackberry and then smiles) They're

sweet. If I could only get my hands

on some money, someone could just tell

me the answer. I gotta do. But If I

ever do, I end up thinking about it

instead. I gotta do. But do what? (Justine

pushes the blackberry he's about to

eat away from his mouth) What...? What

was that for?

They looked dirty. I, I think I saw

a bug in them or something.

I'm worried about Holden. Tom. I'm worried

about Tom. I just befriended Tom, recently,

and now, well, I think he's mentally

ill. He has this idea in his head that

we've had some sort of affair. Which

is crazy because I'm, I'm married. He's

been sayin' all sorts of strange things,

and makin' threats. And drinkin'. And,

and I just think he would be better

off in a place where people, professionals,

could take care of him. Otherwise, he's

just gonna get himself in trouble.

What are you doin' in here? What's that?

It's a home pregnancy test.

Why you takin' it?

'Cause I still haven't gotten my period.

What's it say?

Well, I haven't taken it yet. Could

you give me a minute please?

I wanna be here when you find out.

Okay.

The little plastic doohickey's turnin'

blue. What's that mean?

Blue?

Bright blue.

It means I'm pregnant.

ALRIGHT!

I knew it. Waste of time going to that

sperm doctor. We did it. We're gonna

have ourselves a baby.

Maybe.

And tomorrow, we're gonna celebrate

at Senor Tuna. Yes we are. I'm gonna

bring Bubba. You can bring some of your

friends from work. Or Bible study guy.

Whoever. Too bad Gwen's dead.

The test could be wrong, Phil. It's

a little early to be havin' a party.

Let's do it mellow then. You sure don't

seem too excited.

No, I'm excited. It's just, a lot of

worries come with havin' a baby...

Don't think negative. Think positive.

We could have ourselves a tiny Phil.

Or a tiny Teeny. Teeny's gonna have

a tiny weeny Teeny.

Do you think anything's gonna change

havin' a baby?

What do you mean? Everything's gonna

change.

Yeah, but I mean, do you think anything's

really gonna change?

What do ya mean?

(picks up the phone) Hello?

Hi, this is Dr. Williams returning the

call of Jean Worther. I'm calling from

the Holland County psychiatric hospital.

(Holden hangs up)

Who was it, Tom?

It was a wrong number.

Either of you seen Holden? Boy is out

on his ass!

Justine, somethin's goin' on. Something

is definately happening.

Go find out.

It's big. It's very big.

C'mon Cheryl, I'm gonna kill you.

Someone stole fifteen thousand dollars

from the safe. They blew the thing open

with a gun.

Oh my god.

Not only that but the cops know who

did it.

Who?

Somebody who works here.

Cheryl!

Holden, Holden did it. Fool left his

cashier key in the door.

Oh my god.

They can't find him though. They say

he robbed his folks too. You in on it?

What?! No!

I know you two played hookie in the

store room. I never rat on ya, I've

done some things myself. But, still.

You in on it?

I don't know what you're talkin' about.

Suit yourself.

Justine. Can we talk to you for a second?

Hi, Justine. Go ahead and have a seat.

Justine, you like workin' at the Retail

Rodeo don't you? Like the company, like

the people? You wouldn't want to jeopardize

that by makin' some silly error in judgement

would ya?

Holden stole fifteen thousand dollars

from the safe last night. Did you have

anything to do with it?

No. I don't know anything.

'Cause we know you're pretty tight with

Holden.

I hardly know him.

I've seen you in the store room with

him Justine. On many the occasion. I

think you know him pretty well.

I don't know anything.

Justine! Justine!

I did it! I finally did somethin'!

Holden, the police are lookin' for you!

Oh, who cares? I'm proud of myself.

Fuck them, Fuck all of them!

Hey! They think that I'm in on it, too!

Corny's got a camera in that storage

room. That Bible thumpin' pervert's

been watchin' us the whole time.

Well, we're outta here! Justine, I got

over twenty thousand dollars! I got

a gun, what else?!

I'm gettin' all goosey. I think I'm

gonna crash. (takes a right turn and

stops the car) I'm pregnant, Holden.

It's my baby.

Not necessarily.

Yes, it is. You know it is.

Even if it is, you cannot raise a baby

on the run.

Yes, you can. I mean, you can't raise

a baby here. You know that. Justine.

You hate your husband. You hate your

job. You love me, so let's go.

I can't go tonight. I gotta pack my

things and I'd have to get more money.

Well, then tomorrow. I'll go to the

motel and wait for you. Just be there

by noon.

This is all going too fast.

Justine, what have you got to lose?

Nothin'.

So be there by noon.

Okay.

I love you, Justine. This is all gonna

work out. I know it. I almost forgot.

This is a story of your life. You inspired

me. (they kiss and Holden gets out of

the car)

Hey Teeny!

Hey.

We were gettin' worried about ya!

Sorry.

Justine, this is Liberta. Liberta, this

is Justine.

Hi.

Hi.

Congratulations, on your expectation.

Thanks.

Do you think it's a girl or a boy?

Doesn't matter. As long as it plays

quarterback for the Cowboys.

Well, I hear Senor Tuna callin'. (phone

rings)

(picks up the phone) Hello. Yeah. Well,

that's not right. What's that supposed

to mean? Hey look. No. You don't know

shit okay. Justine's pregnant. You got

that? Well, look you better check your

records again, pal, then call me! (hangs

up) Some doctor says my sperm's no good.

Does that mean Justine's not pregnant?

No. That just means they got it wrong,

is all. They don't know everything.

They just got it wrong, so...

Looks like that wind's pickin' up again.

How it all came down to this, only the

devil knows. Retail Rodeo was at the

corner on my left, the motel was down

the road to my right. I closed my eyes

and tried to peer into the future. On

my left I saw days upon days of lipstick

and ticking clocks. Dirty looks and

quiet whisperings. and burning secrets

that won't ever die away. And on my

right, what could I picture? The blue

sky, the desert earth streching out

into the eerie infinity. A beautiful,

never ending nothing.

Hey Justine.

I know where you can find him.

Holden?

He's at the Hotel Glen Capri, and he'll

be there till noon.

You done good. You're a good girl.

Hey.

Hey.

What's going on in the bedroom? Looks

like a twister hit it.

Oh yeah. I was doin' laundry.

I thought we were robbed. Why aren't

you at work?

They gave me the day off.

Retail Rodeo? You know that guy?

No.

Attention Retail Rodeo employees this

is JAck Fields, your store manager.

As most of you all know by now, We lost

another employee yesterday. Holden was

a thief and a disturbed young man, and

what happened was a sad thing. Perhaps

we can learn a lesson from this tragedy,

like don't steal and don't be disturbed.

The important is to move on. Like dozens

of those who quit. This one's for you

Holden.

I thought we were gonna get a day off

and go to the movies....

What?

I was just at your house and the mail

came. Phil was opening letters, and

he opened this bill from the credit

card company. And F&$%. Please don't

tell him about us, Justine. Please.

Please. I love Phil. I love him more

than myself. Please have mercy on me.

Hey Phil.

Have you been sleepin' around behind

my back?

What?

I said, have you been sleepin' around

behind my back?

Yes. (he slaps her)

Why? Why?

I don't know why.

Don't you love me? Don't you love me

at all?

You're the only man alive that I love.

Oh god. Please don't tell me it's not

my baby.

It's your baby.

Are you sure?

It is. I swear. I swear to God.

Who is he?

It doesn't matter.

Yes, it does. Was it some guy from work?

Yes.

Yeah, I know who it was. It was that

Bible guy, wasn't it? The Nazarine.

That's why you were actin' so spooked.

Yeah, yeah.

I'm gonna beat his ass.

Don't.

You're gettin' all swollen. I'm sorry

I hit you, baby.

I'm sorry, Phil.

I need to get stoned.

Okay. Get stoned.

I just gotta escape, you know. You ever

feel like that? Like you gotta escape?

What are those?

Fake eyelashes. Extra long.

Just do it normal for once?

You want me to make the other cheek

purple to even it out?

No.

D'you hear about Corny? He was goin'

home after Bible study last night and

two beefy guys with painted faces pulled

up in a truck and jumped him.

That's terrible.

That day I read the story Holden wrote

for me. It was kinda different from

the other one, but kinda the same. It

was about a woman who was put upon.

Whose job was a prison, and whose life

had lost all meaning. Other people don't

get her, especially her husband. One

day she meets a boy who is also put

upon, and they fall in love. After spending

their whole lives not getting got, with

one look they get eachother completely.

In the end, the boy and the girl run

away together in the wilderness, never

to be heard from again.
