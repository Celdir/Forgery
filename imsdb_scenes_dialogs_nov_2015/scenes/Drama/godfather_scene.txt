FRANCIS FORD COPPOLA

INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

The PARAMOUNT Logo is presented austerely over a black

background.  There is a moment's hesitation, and then the

simple words in white lettering:

While this remains, we hear: "I believe in America."

Suddenly we are watching in CLOSE VIEW, AMERIGO BONASERA, a

man of sixty, dressed in a black suit, on the verge of great

emotion.

As he speaks, THE VIEW imperceptibly begins to loosen.

He can barely speak; he is weeping now.

By now, THE VIEW is full, and we see Don Corleone's office

in his home.

The blinds are closed, and so the room is dark, and with

patterned shadows.  We are watching BONASERA over the

shoulder of DON CORLEONE.  TOM HAGEN sits near a small

table, examining some paperwork, and SONNY CORLEONE stands

impatiently by the window nearest his father, sipping from a

glass of wine.  We can HEAR music, and the laughter and

voices of many people outside.

BONASERA whispers into the DON's ear.

Both HAGEN and SONNY react.

Slowly, Bonasera bows his head and murmurs.

EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

A HIGH ANGLE of the CORLEONE MALL in bright daylight.  There

are at least five hundred guests filling the main courtyard

and gardens.  There is music and laughing and dancing and

countless tables covered with food and wine.

DON CORLEONE stands at the Gate, flanked on either side by a

son: FREDO and SONNY, all dressed in the formal attire of

the wedding party.  He warmly shakes the hands, squeezes the

hands of the friends and guests, pinches the cheeks of the

children, and makes them all welcome.  They in turn carry

with them gallons of homemade wine, cartons of freshly baked

bread and pastries, and enormous trays of Italian delicacies.

The entire family poses for a family portrait: DON CORLEONE,

MAMA, SONNY, his wife, SANDRA, and their children, TOM HAGEN

and his wife, THERESA, and their BABY; CONSTANZIA, the

bride, and her bridegroom, CARLO RIZZI.  As they move into

the pose, THE DON seems preoccupied.

Everyone in the group feels the uneasiness as the DON moves

back to the house.  SONNY gives a delicious smile in the

direction of the Maid-of-Honor, LUCY MANCINI.  She returns

it.  Then he moves to his wife.

HAGEN kisses his WIFE, and follows THE DON, passing the wine

barrels, where a group of FOUR MEN nervously wait.  TOM

crooks a finger at NAZORINE, who doublechecks that he is

next, straightens, and follows HAGEN.

EXT DAY: MALL ENTRANCE (SUMMER 1945)

Outside the main gate of the Mall, SEVERAL MEN in suits,

working together with a MAN in a dark sedan, walk in and out

of the rows of parked cars, writing license plate numbers

down in their notebooks.  We HEAR the music and laughter

coming from the party in the distance.

A MAN stops at a limousine and copies down the number.

BARZINI, dignified in a black homburg, is always under the

watchful eyes of TWO BODYGUARDS as he makes his way to

embrace DON CORLEONE in the courtyard.

The MEN walk down another row of parked cars.  Put another

number in the notebook.  A shiney new Cadillac with wooden

bumpers.

PETER CLEMENZA, dancing the Tarantella joyously, bumping

bellies with the ladies.

He mops his sweating forehead with a big handkerchief.

PAULIE hustles, gets a glass of icy black wine, and brings

it to him.

PAULIE nods and leaves; CLEMENZA takes a breath, and leaps

back into the dance.

The MEN walk down another row of parked cars.  Put another

number in the notebook.

TESSIO, a tall, gentle-looking man, dances with a NINE-YEAR-

OLD GIRL, her little black party shoes planted on his

enormous brown shoes.

The MEN move on to other parked cars, when SONNY storms out

of the gate, his face flushed with anger, followed by

CLEMENZA and PAULIE.

The MAN doesn't answer, but points to the DRIVER of the

sedan.  SONNY menacingly thrusts his reddened face at him.

The DRIVER merely flips open his wallet to a greed card,

without saying a word.  SONNY steps back, spits on the

ground, turns, and walks away, followed by CLEMENZA, PAULIE,

and another TWO MEN.  He doesn't say a thing for most of the

walk back into the courtyard, and then, muttered to PAULIE.

INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

DON CORLEONE sits quietly behind his massive desk in the

dark study.

The DON shrugs; such are the way with those things; NAZORINE

nods.

NAZORINE backs out, all smiles, and nods to the GODFATHER.

DON CORLEONE rises and moves to the Venetian blinds.

The DON moves to the windows, peeking out through the blinds.

The DON is peeking out to the MEN around the barrel, waiting

to see him.

EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

WHAT HE SEES:

NIPPI waits nervously by the barrel.

LUCA BRASI sitting alone, grotesque and quiet.

INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

The DON turns to HAGEN.

The DON nods to this.  Turns back to the blinds and peeks out.

EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

WHAT HE SEES:

MICHAEL CORLEONE, dressed in the uniform of a Marine Captain,

leads KAY ADAMS through the wedding crowd, occasionally

stopped and greeted by FRIENDS of the family.

INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

The DON, inside the office, peering through the blinds,

following them.

EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

MICHAEL moves through the crowd, embraces MAMA and introduces

her to his GIRL.

EXT DAY: OFFICE WINDOW (SUMMER 1945)

The DON's eyes peering through the blinds.

EXT DAY: MALL TABLES (SUMMER 1945)

KAY and MICHAEL settle by a table on the edge of the wedding,

burdened down with plates of food and glasses and wine.  She

is exhilarated by the enormity of the affair, the music and

the vitality.

KAY looking about, a young and lively thing in a gift shop.

We see what she sees:

Her interest is caught by THREE MEN standing by the wine

barrels.

EXT DAY: WEDDING PARTY (SUMMER 1945)

CONNIE CORLEONE, the Bride, is pressing the bodice of her

overly-fluffy white gown against the groom, CARLO RIZZI.  He

is bronzed, with curly blondish hair and lovely dimples.

She absolutely adores him and can barely take her eyes from

him long enough to thank the various GUESTS for the white

envelopes they are putting into the large white purse she

holds.  In fact, if we watch carefully, we can see that one

of her hands is slid under his jacket, and into his shirt,

where she is provocatively rubbing the hair on his chest.

CARLO, on the other hand, has his blue eyes trained on the

bulging envelopes, and is trying to guess how much cash the

things hold.

Discreetly, he moves her hand off of his skin.

The purse, looped by a ribbon of silk around CONNIE's arm,

is fat with money.

A little distance away, a young man, PAULIE GATTO, catches a

prosciutto sandwich thrown by a friend, without once taking

eyes from the purse.

SONNY is sitting at the Wedding Dias, talking to LUCY

MANCINI, the Maid of Honor.  Every once in a while he

glances across the courtyard, where his WIFE is talking with

some WOMEN.

He bends over and whispers something into LUCY's ear.

SANDRA and the WOMEN are in the middle of a big, ribald laugh.

SANDRA's hands separate with expanding width further and

further apart until she bursts into a peal of laughter.

Through her separated hands she sees the Wedding Dais.

SONNY and LUCY are gone.

INT DAY: DON'S HALL & STAIRS (SUMMER 1945)

The empty hallway.  The bathroom door opens and LUCY

surreptitiously steps out.

She looks up where SONNY is standing on the second landing,

motioning for her to come up.

She lifts her petticoats off the ground and hurries upstairs.

EXT DAY: MALL TABLES (SUMMER 1945)

KAY and MICHAEL.

She has picked out LUCA BRASI.

She starts to eat her spaghetti.

She begins eating, looking at him eagerly.

The smile on his face seems to indicate that he is telling a

tall story.

LUCA comes toward them to meet TOM HAGEN halfway, just near

their table.

HAGEN smiles and moves back to the house, LUCA ominously

following.

INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

DON CORLEONE at the window.  He has seen the intimacy of the

YOUNG COUPLE.

THE DON turns to the stiffly formal LUCA, and he moves

forward to kiss his hand.  He takes the envelope from his

jacket, holds it out, but does not release it until he makes

a formal speech.

THE DON takes it, and then LUCA's hand, which he squeezes so

tightly we might imagine it to be painful.

He turns, almost an about-face, and leaves the study with

the same formality he entered with.  DON CORLEONE breathes

more easily, and gives the thick envelope to HAGEN.

DON CORLEONE is not pleased.

THE DON nods.

We now begin to hear a song coming over the loud-speakers

from outside.  In Italian, with unmistakable style.

He moves to the window, pulls the blinds up, flooding the

room with light.

EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

JOHNNY FONTANE on the bandstand, singing to the delight and

excitement of the wedding GUESTS.

JOHNNY finishes the song and the CROWD screams with delight.

They call out for another when DON CORLEONE appears.

At once a dozen wine glasses are offered to JOHNNY, who

takes a sip from each as he moves to embrace his GODFATHER.

He's very disturbed.  The GODFATHER indicates that he come

with him to the office so no one will notice.  He turns to

HAGEN.

They go, leaving HAGEN scanning the party looking for SONNY.

INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

HAGEN glances up the staircase.

Then he goes up.

INT DAY: DON'S UPSTAIRS ROOM (SUMMER 1945)

SONNY and LUCY are in a room upstairs; he has lifted her

gown's skirts almost over her head, and has her standing

against the door.  Her face peeks out from the layers of

petticoats around it like a flower in ecstasy.

Her head bouncing against the door with the rhythm of his

body.  But there is a knocking as well.  They stop, freeze

in that position.

INT DAY: DON'S UPSTAIRS HALLWAY (SUMMER 1945)

Outside, HAGEN by the door.

HAGEN hesitates.  We HEAR LUCY's head bouncing against the

door again.  TOM leaves.

INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

Both HAGEN and JOHNNY cannot refrain from laughing.  The DON

smiles.  SONNY enters as noiselessly as possible, still

adjusting his clothes.

The DON is silent, stern.

He glances at SONNY, who makes himself as inconspicuous as

he can.

He takes JOHNNY to the door, pinching his cheek hard enough

to hurt.

He closes the door, smiling to himself.  Turns to HAGEN.

This saddens the DON.  He sighs.

EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

Now all the wedding GUESTS excitedly clap their hands over

the entrance of the cake: NAZORINE is beaming as he wheels

in a serving table containing the biggest, gaudiest, most

extravagant wedding cake ever baked, an incredible monument

of his gratitude.  The CROWD is favorably impressed: they

begin to clink their knives or forks against their glasses,

in the traditional request for the Bride to cut the cake and

kiss the Groom.  Louder and louder, five hundred forks

hitting five hundred glasses.

EXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)

Silence.

HIGH ANGLE ON THE MALL, late day.  The GUESTS are gone.  A

single black car is in the courtyard.  FREDDIE is behind the

driver's seat: the DON enters the car, looks at MICHAEL, who

sits between SONNY and JOHNNY in the rear seat.

The DON pulls the door shut; and the car pulls out, through

the gate of the great Corleone Mall.

INT DAY: HOSPITAL CORRIDOR (SUMMER 1945)

A long white hospital corridor, at the end of which we can

see a grouping of FIVE WOMEN, some old and some young, but

all plump and dressed in black.

DON CORLEONE and his SONS move toward the end.  But then the

DON slows, putting his hand on MICHAEL's shoulder.  MICHAEL

stops and turns toward his FATHER.  The two looks at one

another for some time.  SILENCE.  DON CORLEONE then lifts

his hand, and slowly touches a particular medal on MICHAEL's

uniform.

Again they regard each other without a word.  MICHAEL turns,

and continues on.  DON CORLEONE watches a moment, and then

follows.

INT DAY: HOSPITAL ROOM (SUMMER 1945)

DON CORLEONE enters the hospital room, moving closest to OUR

VIEW.  He is followed by his SONS, JOHNNY and the WOMEN.

GENCO is a tiny, wasted skeleton of a man.  DON CORLEONE

takes his bony hand, as the others arrange themselves around

his bed, each clasping the other hand in turn.

The DON motions all the others to leave the room.  They do.

He returns his attention to GENCO, holding his hand and

whispering things we cannot hear, as they wait for death.

INT NIGHT: AIRPLANE (SUMMER 1945)

FADE IN:

The interior of a non-stop Constellation.  HAGEN is one of

the very few passengers on this late flight.  He looks like

any young lawyer on a business trip.  He is tired from the

difficult preparation and duties that he has just executed

during the wedding.  On the seat next to him is an enormous,

bulging briefcase.  He closes his eyes.

INT NIGHT: HONEYMOON HOTEL (SUMMER 1945)

The honeymoon hotel: CARLO and CONNIE.  CARLO is in his

undershorts, sitting up on the bed, anxiously taking the

envelopes out of the silk bridal purse and counting the

contents.  CONNIE prepares herself in the large marble

bathroom.  She rubs her hands over his bronze shoulders, and

tries to get his interest.

INT NIGHT: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

DON CORLEONE in his office.  LUCA BRASI sitting near to him.

INT NIGHT: MANCINI APT. HALL (SUMMER 1945)

The hallway of an apartment building.  SONNY enters, climbs

two steps at a time.  He knocks, and then whispers.

The door opens, and two lovely arms are around him, pulling

him into the apartment.

INT NIGHT: LUCA'S ROOM (WINTER 1945)

LUCA BRASI's tiny room.  He is partly dressed.  He kneels

and reaches under his bed and pulls out a small, locked

trunk.  He opens it, and takes out a heavy, bullet-proof

vest.  He puts it on, over his wool undershirt, and then

puts on his shirt and jacket.  He takes his gun, quickly

disassembles, checks, and reassembles it.  And leaves.

INT NIGHT: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

A CLOSE VIEW of DON CORLEONE thinking quietly.

INT NIGHT: MOVING TRAIN (SUMMER 1945)

MICHAEL and KAY on a train, speeding on their way to New

Hampshire.

INT NIGHT: SUBWAY (WINTER 1945)

LUCA, in his bulky jacket, sitting quietly on an empty

subway train.

INT NIGHT: AIRPLANE (SUMMER 1945)

HAGEN on the Constellation.  He reaches into his briefcase,

and takes out several pictures and papers.

One photograph is of a smiling man, JACK WOLTZ, linked arm

in arm with fifteen movie stars on either side, including a

lovely young child star to his immediate right.

HAGEN considers other papers.

INT NIGHT: DON'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)

DON CORLEONE looks, and then moves HAGEN into an embrace.

He straightens his arms and looks at TOM deeply.

EXT DAY: WOLTZ ESTATE GATE (SUMMER 1945)

JACK WOLTZ ESTATE.  HAGEN stands before the impressive gate,

armed only with his briefcase.  A GATEMAN opens the gate,

and TOM enters.

EXT DAY: WOLTZ GARDENS (SUMMER 1945)

HAGEN and WOLTZ comfortably stroll along beautiful formal

gardens, martinis in hand.

They cross the garden and head toward the stables.

They pass the stables, and come to rest by a stall with a

huge bronze plaque attached to the outside wall: "KHARTOUM."

TWO SECURITY GUARDS are positioned in chairs nearby; they

rise as WOLTZ approaches.

The animal inside is truly beautiful.  WOLTZ whispers to him

with true love in his voice.

INT NIGHT: WOLTZ DINING ROOM (SUMMER 1945)

HAGEN and WOLTZ sit at an enormous dining room table,

attended by SEVERAL SERVANTS.  Great paintings hang on the

walls.  The meal is elaborate and sumptuous.

EXT DAY: GENCO OLIVE OIL CO. (SUMMER 1945)

An unimposing little building in New York City on Mott

Street with a large old sign: "GENCO OLIVE OIL IMPORTS,

INC." next to an open-faced fruit market.

A dark Buick pulls up, and a single small man, whom we

cannot see well because of the distance, gets out and enters

the building.  This is VIRGIL SOLLOZZO.

INT DAY: OLIVE OIL OFFICES (SUMMER 1945)

Looking toward the staircase we can hear SOLLOZZO's footsteps

before he actually rises into view.  He is a small man, very

dark, with curly black hair.  But wiry, and tight and hard,

and obviously very dangerous.  He is greeted at the head of

the stairs by SONNY, who takes his hand and shakes it,

introducing himself.  For a moment, there is a complex of

handshaking quite formal, and whispered respectful

introductions.  Finally, SOLLOZZO is taken into the DON's

glass paneled office; the two principals are introduced.

They are very respectful of one another.  Folding chairs are

brought in by FREDDIE, and soon they are all sitting around

in a circle; the DON, SOLLOZZO, SONNY, HAGEN, FREDDIE,

CLEMENZA and TESSIO.  The DON is the slightest bit foolish

with all his compatriots, whereas SOLLOZZO has brought no

one.  Throughout all that transpires, however, it is clear

that this scene is between two men: SOLLOZZO and DON CORLEONE.

SOLLOZZO nods toward HAGEN.

There is a long silence; in which each person present feels

the tension.  The DON is about to give his answer.

We feel this around the room.

SOLLOZZO takes a breath.

This startles SONNY; he blurts out.

SOLLOZZO hears him first, and then very slowly turns to face

him.  Everyone is the room knows that SONNY has stepped out

of line.

SOLLOZZO nods, understands that this is the dismissal.  He

glances one last time at SONNY.  He rises; all the others do

as well.  He bows to the DON, shakes his hand, and formally

takes his leave.  When the footsteps can no longer be heard:

The DON turns to SONNY.

TWO OFFICE WORKERS are carrying an enormous floral display

with the word "THANK YOU" spelled out in flowers.

INT DAY: WOLTZ'S BEDROOM (SUMMER 1945)

It is large, dominated by a huge bed, in which a man,

presumably WOLTZ, is sleeping.  Soft light bathes the room

from the large windows.  We move closer to him until we see

his face, and recognize JACK WOLTZ.  He turns uncomfortably;

mutters, feels something strange in his bedsheets.  Something

wet.

He wakens, feels the sheets with displeasure; they are wet.

He looks at his hand; the wetness is blood.  He is

frightened, pulls aside the covers, and sees fresh blood on

his sheets and pajamas.  He grunts, pulls the puddle of

blood in his bed.  He feels his own body frantically,

moving, down, following the blood, until he is face to face

with the great severed head of Khartoum lying at the foot of

his bed.  Just blood from the hacked neck.  White reedy

tendons show.  He struggles up to his elbows in the puddle

of blood to see more clearly.  Froth covers the muzzle, and

the enormous eyes of the animal are yellowed and covered

with blood.

WOLTZ tries to scream; but cannot.  No sound comes out.

Then, finally and suddenly an ear-splitting scream of pure

terror escapes from WOLTZ, who is rocking on his hands and

knees in an uncontrolled fit, blood all over him.

INT DAY: OLIVE OIL OFFICES (SUMMER 1945)

CLOSE VIEW on the GODFATHER.  Nodding.

----------------------------------------FADE OUT--------

(SCENES 12 & 12 OMITTED)

FADE IN:

EXT DAY: FIFTH AVENUE (WINTER 1945)

Fifth Avenue in the snow.  Christmas week.  People are

bundled up with rosy faces, rushing to buy presents.

KAY and MICHAEL exit a Fifth Avenue department store,

carrying a stack of gaily wrapped gifts, arm in arm.

They kiss.

INT DAY: HOTEL ROOM (WINTER 1945)

CLOSE ON a wooden radio, playing quiet Music.  THE VIEW PANS

AROUND the dark hotel room, curtained against the daylight.

The two are in each other's arms in a mess of bedsheets on

the two single beds that they have pushed together.

He moves to the telephone.

She hands the phone to MICHAEL who continues the deception.

INT DAY: OLIVE OIL OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

HAGEN in the Olive Oil Company office.  In the background,

through the glass partitions, we can see the DON, at work in

his office.  TOM is tired, and steeped in paperwork.

He smiles.  MICHAEL has hung up.  He looks at the piles of

work, and can't face it.  He rises, puts on his coat and

hat, and continues out.

He peeks into the DON's office.

The DON smiles and nods.

TOM smiles, and leaves; OUR VIEW remaining with DON CORLEONE.

FREDDIE is sitting on a bench in the corner, reading the

afternoon paper.  He puts aside the papers the office

manager has prepared for him, and then moves to FREDDIE,

raps his knuckles on his head to take his nose out of the

paper.

FREDDIE leaves.  He slowly puts on his jacket.  Looks out

his window.

EXT DUSK: OLIVE OIL CO. (WINTER 1945)

FREDDIE crosses the street.

INT DUSK: OLIVE OIL OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

The MANAGER helps him on with his overcoat.  Once again, the

DON glances out his window.

The black car pulls up; FREDDIE driving.

And he starts down the stairs.

EXT DUSK: OLIVE OIL CO. (WINTER 1945)

The light outside is very cold, and beginning to fail.  When

FREDDIE sees his FATHER coming, he moves back into the

driver's seat.  The DON moves to the car, and is about to

get in when he hesitates, and turns back to the long, open

fruit stand near the corner.

The PROPRIETOR springs to serve him.  The DON walks among

the trays and baskets, and merely points to a particular

piece of fruit.  As he selects, the MAN gingerly picks the

pieces of fruit up and puts them into a paper bag.  The DON

pays with a five dollar bill, waits for his change, and then

turns back to the car.

EXT DUSK: POLKS TOY STORE (WINTER 1945)

TOM HAGEN exits carrying a stack of presents, all gift

wrapped.  He continues past the windows.  As he walks,

someone walks right in his way.  He looks up.  It is SOLLOZZO.

He takes TOM by the arm and walks along with him.

A car parked at the curb suddenly flings its rear door open.

HAGEN pulls his arm free.  He is frightened.

TWO MEN suddenly appear on either side of him.

HAGEN, sick to his stomach, moves with his ESCORTS, leaving

our VIEW on the Mechanical windows gaily bobbing the story

of Hansel and Gretel.  We HEAR the car doors shut, and the

car drive off.

EXT NIGHT: RADIO CITY - PHONE BOOTH (WINTER 1945)

RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL during the Christmas show.  KAY and

MICHAEL exit; tears are still streaming down her cheeks, and

she sniffles, and dries her tears with Kleenex.  KAY

nostalgically hums "The Bells of Saint Mary's," as they walk

arm in arm.

They have passed a little enclosed newsstand.  KAY sees

something that terrifies her.  She doesn't know what to do.

MICHAEL still walks, thinking about her question.

She cannot answer him.  Rather she pulls him by the arm,

back to the newsstand, and points.  His face goes grave.

The headlines read: "VITO CORLEONE SHOT, CHIEFTAN GUNNED

DOWN."

MICHAEL is petrified; quickly he takes each edition, drops a

dollar in the tray, and hungrily reads through them.  KAY

knows to remain silent.

EXT DUSK: OLIVE OIL CO. (WINTER 1945)

DON CORLEONE by the fruit stand; he is about to move to the

car, when TWO MEN step from the corner.  Suddenly, the DON

drops the bag of fruit and darts with startling quickness

toward the parked car.

The paper bag has hit the ground, and the fruit begins

rolling along the sidewalk, as we HEAR gunshots.

Five bullets catch the DON in the back; he arches in pain,

and continues toward the car.

The PROPRIETOR of the fruit stand rushes for cover, knocking

over an entire case of fruit.

The TWO GUNMEN move in quickly, anxious to finish him off.

Their feet careful to avoid the rolling fruit.  There are

more GUNSHOTS.

FREDDIE is hysterical; he tries to get out of the car;

having difficulty opening the door.  He rushes out, a gun

trembling in his hand; his mouth open.  He actually drops

the gun.

The gun falls amid the rolling fruit.

The GUNMEN are panicked.  They fire once more at the downed

DON CORLEONE.  His leg and arm twitch where they are hit;

and pools of blood are beginning to form.

The GUNMEN are obviously in a state of panic and confusion;

they disappear around the corner as quickly as they came.

The PEOPLE about the avenue have all but disappeared:

rather, we catch glimpses of them, poking their heads safely

from around corners, inside doorways and arches, and from

windows.  But the street itself is now empty.

FREDDIE is in shock; he looks at his FATHER; now great

puddles of blood have formed, and the DON is lifeless and

face down in them.

FREDDIE falls back on to the curb and sits there, saying

something we cannot understand.  He begins to weep profusely.

INT NIGHT: SUBWAY (WINTER 1945)

LUCA BRASI riding alone on a subway car, late at night.  He

gets off.

He emerges at a subway terminal, proceeds out.

EXT NITE: NIGHT CLUB STREET (WINTER 1945)

LUCA walks down the late night street.  He approaches an

elegant New York Nightclub, whose gaudy neon sign is still

winking this late at night.  He waits and watches.  Then the

sign goes out; and he proceeds into the club.

INT NITE: NIGHTCLUB (WINTER 1945)

The main floor of the Nightclub is very large, with endless

glistening wooden floors.  Now, at this late time, the

chairs have been stacked on the tables and a NEGRO JANITOR

is waxing them.  A single HAT-CHECK GIRL is counting her

receipts.  LUCA moves past the empty bandstand, and sits at

the bar.  ANOTHER MAN, dark and very well-built, moves

behind the bar.

LUCA looks up; and out of the shadows emerges SOLLOZZO.

LUCA Nods.

LUCA listens.

LUCA looks at him; he had no idea the offer would be so good.

SOLLOZZO extends his hand, but LUCA pretends not to see it,

rather, he busies himself putting a cigarette in his mouth.

BRUNO TATTAGLIA, behind the bar, makes a cigarette lighter

magically appear, and holds it to LUCA's cigarette.  Then,

he does an odd thing; he drops the lighter on the bar, and

puts his hand lightly on LUCA's, almost patting it.

INT NITE: SONNY'S LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945)

The telephone in SONNY's house is ringing.  He approaches

it, obviously fresh from a nap.

SONNY cradles the phone.  An incredible rage builds up in

him, his face actually turning red.  He would like to rip

the phone to pieces in his bare hands.  Then he controls it.

Quickly, he dials another number.

He hangs up.

There is a POUNDING on the door.  A BABY starts crying.

SONNY reaches into a cabinet drawer, takes out a gun, and

moves quickly.  He opens the front door quickly.  It is

CLEMENZA.  He enters, SONNY closes the door.  SANDRA goes to

look after the baby.

CLEMENZA leaves; SONNY moves to SANDRA, who sits on the

couch weeping quietly, comforting her BABY.

The telephone rings again.  SONNY answers it.

SANDRA moves behind him, anxious to know who it is.  SONNY

indicates that she be quiet.

EXT NITE: MALL (WINTER 1945)

FULL VIEW OF THE CORLEONE MALL.  It is night, but the

courtyard is bathed with white light from floodlights on the

tops of all the houses.  It is very cold.  We see the figure

of SONNY cross the Mall, and let himself into the main house.

INT NITE: DON'S KITCHEN (WINTER 1945)

SONNY walks into the empty, darkened house.  Then he calls

out.

The kitchen door swings open.  He moves quickly and takes

her by the arm.  He is deliberately calm.

She moves out of the kitchen, and continues upstairs.  SONNY

turns the gas from the pan of peppers she was frying.  He

takes some bread without thinking, and dips it in the oil,

and sloppily eats some of the peppers, as he moves into his

father's office.

INT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

He switches the lights on in the DON's office.  The massive

desk dominates the room.  SONNY moves quickly to the

telephone, pulling a small chair to the side of the desk,

and dials a number.

He hangs up.  He moves quickly to a wall safe; operates the

dial, and removes a small notebook.  He takes it back to the

desk, and runs over the list of numbers with his forefinger.

We follow the names, until the finger stops at one: LUCA

BRASI.  SONNY dials the number.  There is no answer.

INT NITE: BUILDING (WINTER 1945)

The interior of an abandoned building.  SEVERAL MEN in suits

and ties sit around in the booths.

HAGEN sits in one: SOLLOZZO sits across from him.

HAGEN's hands are trembling as he tries to put a cigarette

in his mouth.  ONE of the BUTTON MEN brings a bottle of rye

to the table, and pours a little into a delicate, flowered

china cup.  HAGEN sips gratefully.

HAGEN is overwhelmed: actual tears spring to his eyes.

SOLLOZZO pauses respectfully.

HAGEN still is focused on the grief of losing the old man.

SOLLOZZO rises, impatiently.

He leans close to HAGEN.

He opens the door; they step out together.

EXT NITE: BUILDING

HAGEN, SOLLOZZO exit.

But a car pulls up, and ONE of SOLLOZZO'S MEN rushes out.

He indicates with some urgency that he wants to talk to

SOLLOZZO in private.

Then SOLLOZZO moves with a grave expression.  He opens the

door, indicating that HAGEN should be led back in.

EXT NITE: MALL (WINTER 1945)

MICHAEL driving during the night.  There is a little fog in

the air, and moisture has formed on the windshield, making

it difficult to see well.  The wipers move across the view,

as the gate of the Corleone Mall appears before us, still

decorated for Christmas.  The courtyard is bathed with white

floodlight, giving this place a cold and isolated look.  The

narrow entrance mouth of the Mall is sealed off with a link

chain.  There are strange cars parked along the curving

cement walk.  SEVERAL MEN are congregated about the gate and

chain; ONE of them approaches MICHAEL's car.

ANOTHER peeks his ugly face almost right up to MICHAEL, and

then turns.

The FIRST MAN opens the car door, and MICHAEL steps out.

INT NITE: HALL (WINTER 1945)

The Hallway of the main house is filled with MEN MICHAEL

doesn't recognize.  They pay little attention to him.  Most

of them are waiting; sitting uncomfortably; no one is talking.

INT NITE: DON'S LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945)

MICHAEL moves into the living room; there is a Christmas

tree, and countless greeting cards taped to the walls.

THERESA HAGEN is sitting stiffly on the sofa, smoking a

cigarette; on the coffee table in front of her is a water

glass half filled with whiskey.  On the other side of the

sofa sits CLEMENZA; his face is impassive, but he is

sweating, and the cigar in his hand glistens slickly black

with his saliva.  PAULIE GATTO sits tensely and alone on the

other side of the room.  CLEMENZA sees MICHAEL, looks up at

him.

MICHAEL nods his relief.

He moves to THERESA.

Without looking up, she clings to him for a moment, and

trembles.  Occasionally, STRANGE MEN will cross through the

room; everyone speaks in a whisper.

He leads her into his father's office without knocking.

INT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

SONNY and TESSIO are huddled around a yellow pad.  They look

up, startled.

He reassuringly hugs THERESA, and then to MICHAEL's surprise,

he kisses him on the cheek.

She understands, and leaves them alone.

MICHAEL didn't realize that the men waiting outside were on

trial for their lives.

MICHAEL is just realizing the gravity and extent of the

situation.

Outside, we HEAR THERESA cry out, almost a scream of relief.

Then open the door and rush out.

Everyone is standing: in the doorway, TOM HAGEN is wrapped

in a tight embrace with his WIFE.

EXT NITE: MALL, FEATURING DON'S HOUSE (WINTER 1945)

The windows of the main house are dark except for the DON's

study.  It stands out against the cold, dark night.

INT NITE: DON'S LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945)

The living room is empty, save for PAULIE GATTO sitting on

the edge of the sofa.  The clock reads: 4:00 a.m.

INT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

SONNY, MICHAEL, HAGEN, CLEMENZA and TESSIO; all exhausted,

in shirtsleeves, about to fall asleep.  It is four in the

morning; there is evidence of many cups of coffee and many

snacks.  They can barely talk anymore.

HAGEN widens his sleepy eyes, and looks at the yellow pad.

CLEMENZA nods.

MICHAEL, very tired, picks up the phone, and dials the

number once again.  He can hear the phone ringing on the

other end but no one answers.  Then hangs up.

There is a timid knock on the door.

PAULIE GATTO looks in.

TESSIO gets up, leaves.

He closes the door.

MICHAEL is embarrassed to be so protected.  He dials Luca

Brasi's number once again.  The ring repeats, but no one

answers.

TESSIO comes back, carrying Luca Brasi's bullet-proof vest

in his hand.  He unwraps it; there is a large fish wrapped

inside.

INT. NITE: NIGHTCLUB (WINTER 1945)

LUCA sits at the Bar of the Tattaglia Nightclub, as we

remember him.  BRUNO TATTAGLIA had just patted his hand.

LUCA looks up at him.

Then SOLLOZZO pats the other hand, almost affectionately.

LUCA is just about to twist his hands away, when they both

clamp down as hard as they can.  Suddenly, a garrote is

thrown around his neck, and pulled violently tight.  His

face begins to turn to purple blotches, and then totally

purple, right before our eyes; his tongue hangs out, in a

far more extreme way than a normal tongue could.  His eyes

bulge.

ONE of the MEN looks down at him in disgust as LUCA's

strength leaves him.

SOLLOZZO lets LUCA's hand go with a victorious smile on his

face.

LUCA falls to the floor.

----------------------------------------FADE OUT--------

FADE IN:

EXT DAY: CLEMENZA'S HOUSE (WINTER 1945)

Morning in a simple Brooklyn suburb.  There are rows of

pleasant houses; driveway after driveway, down the block.  A

dark, somber young man of thirty-one or two walks with a

noticeable limp down the sidewalk, and rings the bell.  This

is ROCCO LAMPONE.  The woman of the house, MRS. CLEMENZA,

talks to him through the screen door, and then points to the

side of the house.  ROCCO moves to the garage, which is

specially heated, and in which CLEMENZA is busy at work

washing a shiny brand new Lincoln.  LAMPONE admires the car.

He scrubs and polishes with great affection.

As he scrubs around the glove compartment, he opens it,

unwraps a gun and gives it to LAMPONE.

LAMPONE expertly puts the gun away.  GATTO's car pulls into

the driveway, and he sounds the horn.

The two men walk to the car.  GATTO is driving, a bit

nervous, like he doesn't know what is up.  LAMPONE gets in

the rear seat; CLEMENZA in the front, making a grunt of

recognition.  He looks at his wristwatch, as though wanting

to chide PAULIE for being late.  PAULIE flinches a little

when he sees LAMPONE will ride behind him; he half turns:

CLEMENZA turns sourly to PAULIE.

PAULIE relaxes a bit; he thinks he's off any possible hook

he was on.  Also there's the money he can make by selling

Sollozzo any secret location.

The car pulls out.

EXT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR - ON ROAD (WINTER 1945)

Inside PAULIE drives; and CLEMENZA sits in a grump.  OUR

VIEW does not show LAMPONE in the rear seat.

EXT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR AT TUNNEL (WINTER 1945)

The Car crosses to the Midtown Tunnel in the late Winter

light.

INT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR IN TUNNEL (WINTER 1945)

Inside the tunnel; GATTO doesn't like not seeing LAMPONE.

He tries to adjust his rearview mirror to catch a glimpse of

him.

EXT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR AT MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)

The car is parked in the City.  PAULIE comes down from an

available apartment and gets back into the car.

The car pulls off.

EXT DAY: RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)

New part of the city; the car pulls up in a parking lot.

CLEMENZA get outs, glances at LAMPONE, then to PAULIE.

He walks, tucking his shirt into his pants, around the

corner and enters the Luna Restaurant.

INT DAY: RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)

CLEMENZA enters the little restaurant, sits down at a table.

The WAITERS know him; immediately put a bottle of wine, some

bread--and then a plate of veal on his table.  He eats.

EXT DAY: RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)

CLEMENZA exits the restaurant, belches, adjusts his pants;

he is well fed.

We move with him around the corner, not knowing what to

expect has happened to Paulie.

There is the car; PAULIE is still sitting behind the wheel,

LAMPONE in the rear seat.  CLEMENZA steps in.

The car pulls out.  By now, PAULIE is completely relaxed and

secure.

EXT DAY: PAULIE'S CAR ON CAUSEWAY (WINTER 1945)

The car moves along the ready beach area of the causeway.

Inside, CLEMENZA turns to PAULIE.

The car pulls off the Causeway, into the reeds.  CLEMENZA

steps out of the car, OUR VIEW MOVING with him.

He turns his back three quarters from us (we can no longer

see the car), unzips, and we hear the sound of urine hitting

the ground.  We wait on this for a moment; and then there

are two GUNSHOTS.  CLEMENZA finishes his leak, zips up and

turns, moving back to the car.

PAULIE is dead, bleeding from the mouth; the windows behind

him are shattered.

LAMPONE gets out, the two men walk through the reeds a few

feet where there is another car.  They get in, and drive off.

---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

EXT DAY: MALL (WINTER 1945)

HIGH ANGLE OF THE MALL.  It is late afternoon.  Many strange

cars are parked on the nearby streets.  We can see the group

of BUTTON MEN, stationed here and there, obviously sentries

with concealed weapons.

MICHAEL walks along in the rear yard.

He is bundled in a warm marine coat.  He looks at the

strange men, regarding them with an uncertain awe.  They

look back at him, at first suspiciously and then with the

respect of his position.  He is like an exile Prince.  He

wanders past them, and hesitates and looks at the yard.

A rusted set of garden swings; and other home playground

equipment.  The basketball ring now half coming off.  This

is where he was a child.  Then a shout.

CLEMENZA had shouted from the kitchen window.  MICHAEL

hurries into the house.

INT DAY: DON'S KITCHEN (WINTER 1945)

CLEMENZA is in the kitchen, cooking over an enormous pot.

He points to the kitchen wall phone which is hanging off the

hook.

MICHAEL picks it up.

He glances at the THUGS in the kitchen.  Tries to shield the

phone.

MICHAEL glances at the HOODS at the kitchen table.  He curls

up in a corner, and in a quarter voice:

CLEMENZA is getting ready to build a tomato sauce for all

the button men stationed around the house.

SONNY peeks into the kitchen; sees CLEMENZA.

MICHAEL starts to leave.

EXT NITE: CAR

MICHAEL sits in the rear seat, calmly, as he is being driven

into the city.  THREE BUTTONMEN are crowded into the front

seat.

INT NITE: HOTEL LOBBY

MICHAEL crosses the lobby, past lines of servicemen trying

to book rooms.

INT NITE: HOTEL

MICHAEL and KAY eating a quiet dinner at the hotel.  He is

preoccupied, she's concerned.

He leans over her; kisses her.

Quietly, he moves out the door.

KAY lies on the bed a while, and then, to herself:

EXT NITE: DON'S HOSPITAL (WINTER 1945)

A taxi pulls up in front of a hospital, marked clearly with

a neon sign "HOSPITAL--EMERGENCY."  MICHAEL steps out, pays

the fare...and then stops dead in his tracks.

MICHAEL looks.

He sees the hospital in the night; but it is deserted.  He

is the only one on the street.  There are gay, twinkling

Christmas decorations all over the building.  He walks,

slowly at first, and then ever so quickly, up the steps.  He

hesitates, looks around.  This area is empty.  He checks the

address on a scrap of paper.  It is correct.  He tries the

door, it is empty.

He walks in.

INT NITE: HOSPITAL LOBBY (WINTER 1945)

MICHAEL stands in the center of an absolutely empty hospital

lobby.  He looks to the right; there is a long, empty

corridor.  To the left: the same.

HIGH FULL ANGLE, as MICHAEL walks through the desolated

building lit by eerie green neon lighting.  All we hear are

his sole footsteps.

He walks up to a desk marked "INFORMATION".  No one is there.

He moves quickly to a door marked "OFFICE"; swings into it;

no one is there.  He looks onto the desk:  There is half a

sandwich, and a half-filled bottle of coke.

Now he knows something is happening, he moves quickly,

alertly.  MICHAEL walking down the hospital corridors; all

alone.  The floors have just been mopped.  They are still wet.

INT NITE: HOSPITAL STAIRS

Now he turns onto a staircase; ever quickening; up several

flights.

INT NITE: 4TH FLOOR CORRIDOR

He steps out onto the fourth floor.  He looks.  There are

merely empty corridors.  He takes out his scrap of paper;

checks it.  "Room 4A."  Now he hurries, trying to follow the

code of hospital rooms; following the right arrows, quicker

and quicker they flash by him.  Now he stops, looks up "4A--

Corleone".

There is a special card table set up there with some

magazines...and some smoking cigarettes still in the

ashtray--but no detectives, no police, no bodyguards.

INT NITE: DON'S ROOM 4A

Slowly he pushes the door open, almost afraid at what he

will find.  He looks.  Lit by the moonlight through the

window, he can see a FIGURE in the hospital bed alone in the

room, and under a transparent oxygen tent.  All that can be

heard is the steady though strained breathing.  Slowly

MICHAEL walks up to it, and is relieved to see his FATHER,

securely asleep.  Tubes hang from a steel gallows beside the

bed, and run to his nose and mouth.

This startles MICHAEL; who almost jumps around.  It is a

NURSE lit from the light behind her in the hallway.

MICHAEL calms himself, and moves to her.

Quickly he moves to the telephone, dials a number.

He hangs up; returns to the NURSE...

She does so...and they perform the very difficult task of

moving the bed and the apparatus, out of the room.

INT NITE: 4TH FLOOR HOSPITAL (WINTER 1945)

They roll the bed, the stand, and all the tubes silently

down the corridor.  We hear FOOTSTEPS coming up the stairs.

MICHAEL hears them, stops.

They push it into the first available room.  MICHAEL peeks

out from the door.  The footsteps are louder; then they

emerge.  It is ENZO, NAZORINE's helper, carrying a bouquet

of flowers.

A look of fear sweeps through ENZO's face.

MICHAEL thinks, realizes he needs all the help he can get.

INT NITE: DON'S SECOND HOSPITAL ROOM (WINTER 1945)

They part.  MICHAEL moves into the hospital room where they

put his FATHER.

MICHAEL looks at the OLD MAN, his eyes are open, though he

cannot speak.  MICHAEL touches his face tenderly.

The OLD MAN tries to speak...but cannot.  MICHAEL tenderly

puts his finger to his FATHER's lips.

EXT NITE: DON'S HOSPITAL STREET (WINTER 1945)

Outside the hospital is empty save for a nervous ENZO,

pacing back and forth brandishly the flowers as his only

weapon.  MICHAEL exits the hospital and moves to him.  They

both stand under a lamppost in the cold December night.

They are both frightened; MICHAEL gives ENZO a cigarette,

lights it.  ENZO's hands are trembling, MICHAEL's are not.

The windows of the hospital twinkle with Christmas

decorations.

We HEAR the sound of a single automobile coming.  MICHAEL

and ENZO look with fear in their eyes.  Then MICHAEL takes

the bouquet of flowers and stuffs them under his jacket.

They stand, hands in their pockets.

A long low black car turns the corner and cruises by them.

MICHAEL's and ENZO's faces are tough, impassive.  The car

seems as though it will stop; and then quickly accelerates.

MICHAEL and ENZO are relieved.  MICHAEL looks down; the

BAKER's hands are shaking.  He looks at his own, and they

are not.

Another moment goes by and we can hear the distant sound of

police sirens.  They are clearly coming toward the hospital,

getting louder and louder.  MICHAEL heaves a sigh of relief.

In a second, a patrol car makes a screaming turn in front of

the hospital; then two more squad cars follow with uniformed

POLICE and DETECTIVES.  He smiles his relief and starts

toward them.  TWO huge, burly POLICEMEN suddenly grab his

arms while ANOTHER frisks him.  A massive POLICE CAPTAIN,

spattered with gold braid and scrambled eggs on his hat,

with beefy red face and white hair seems furious.  This is

McCLUSKEY.

ANOTHER COP standing nearby:

MICHAEL studies McCLUSKEY closely.

MICHAEL stands quiet.

Without any warning, McCLUSKEY leans back and hits MICHAEL

squarely on the jaw with all his weight and strength.

MICHAEL groans, and lifts his hand to his jaw.  He looks at

McCLUSKEY; we are his VIEW and everything goes spinning, and

he falls to the ground, just as we see HAGEN and CLEMENZA'S

MEN arrive.

---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

EXT DAY: MALL (WINTER 1945)

HIGH ANGLE VIEW of THE CORLEONE MALL.  The gateway now has a

long black car blocking it.  There are more BUTTON MEN

stationed more formally; and some of them visibly carrying

rifles; those of the houses close to the courtyard have MEN

standing by open windows.  It is clear that the war is

escalating.  A car pulls up and out get CLEMENZA, LAMPONE,

MICHAEL and HAGEN.  MICHAEL's jaw is wired and bandaged.  He

stops and looks up at the open window.  We can see MEN

holding rifles.

They continue walking.  TESSIO joins them.  The various

BODYGUARDS make no acknowledgment.

INT DAY: DON'S HALLWAY

They enter the house past the scores of new and strange faces.

INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

SONNY is in the DON's office; he is excited and exuberant.

He sees MICHAEL, and holds his bandaged face in his hand,

kiddingly.

HAGEN bows his head; he is deeply concerned.

Everyone in the room is astonished; they all look at MICHAEL.

Silence.  SONNY suddenly breaks out in laughter.  He points

a finger at MICHAEL, trying to speak.

Now CLEMENZA and TESSIO are also smiling; only HAGEN keeps

his face serious.

MICHAEL radiates danger...SONNY stops laughing.

INT DAY: CLEMENZA'S CELLAR (WINTER 1945)

CLOSE on a revolver.

MICHAEL is alone with CLEMENZA in a cellar workshop.

They put the hat on; CLEMENZA adjusts it.

INT DAY: DON'S HALL & LIVING ROOM (WINTER 1945)

MICHAEL steps into the foyer of the main house.  A card

table is set up with a man playing cards with three of the

Corleone buttonmen.

He continues into the living room.  It's a mess.  SONNY

asleep on the sofa.  On the coffee table are the remains of

a take-out Chinese food dinner, and a half-empty bottle of

whisky.  The radio is playing.

The phone rings in the DON's office.

INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

HAGEN has hurried into the Den to get the phone; the OTHERS

move in.

HAGEN's on the phone; he writes something down.

MICHAEL moves out.

EXT NITE: CAMELS SIGN (WINTER 1945)

The enormous "CAMELS" sign, puffing smoke, below it stands

MICHAEL, dressed in a warm overcoat, and wearing the hat

CLEMENZA had given him.  A long black car pulls around the

corner and slows before him.  The DRIVER, leaning over, open

the front door.

He does, the car drives off.

EXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR (WINTER 1945)

Inside the car, SOLLOZZO reaches his hand over the back seat

and shakes MIKE's hand.

McCLUSKEY grunts.

He gives MICHAEL a thorough frisk.

EXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR - WEST SIDE HIGHWAY (WINTER 1945)

MICHAEL looks at the DRIVER and then ahead to see where

they're heading.

The car takes the George Washington Bridge.  MICHAEL is

concerned.

MICHAEL closes his eyes.

EXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR ON G.W. BRIDGE (WINTER 1945)

The car speeds along the George Washington Bridge on its way

to New Jersey.  Then suddenly it hits the divider,

temporarily lifts into the air, and bounces over into the

lanes going back to New York.  It then hits it very fast, on

the way back to the city.

EXT NITE: SOLLOZZO'S CAR (WINTER 1945)

SOLLOZZO checks to see the cars that had been following, and

then leans to the DRIVER.

MICHAEL is relieved.

EXT NITE: LUNA AZURA RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)

The car pulls up in front of a little family restaurant in

the Bronx:  The "LUNA AZURA".  There is no one on the street.

MICHAEL looks to see if the DRIVER is going to get out with

them.  He gets out, and opens the door.  SOLLOZZO, McCLUSKEY

and MICHAEL get out; the DRIVER remains leaning against the

car.  They enter the restaurant.

INT NITE: LUNA AZURA (WINTER 1945)

A very small family restaurant with a mosaic tile floor.

SOLLOZZO, MICHAEL and McCLUSKEY sit around a rather small

round table near the center of the room.  There are empty

booths along the side walls; with a handful of CUSTOMERS,

and ONE or TWO WAITERS.  It is very quiet.

The solitary WAITER brings a bottle of wine to the table.

They watch him silently as he uncorks it and pours three

glasses.  Then, when he leaves, SOLLOZZO turns to McCLUSKEY:

SOLLOZZO now begins in rapid Sicilian.  MICHAEL listening

carefully and nodding every so often.  Then MICHAEL answers

in Sicilian, and SOLLOZZO goes on.  The WAITER occasionally

brings food; and they hesitate while he is there; then go on.

Then MICHAEL, having difficulty expressing himself in

Italian, accidentally lapses into English.

MICHAEL looks long and hard at SOLLOZZO, who is smiling

holding his open hands up as if to say: "I have no tricks up

my sleeve".  Then he looks away and makes a distressed look

on his face.

SOLLOZZO is intuitively suspicious.  He studies MICHAEL with

his dark eyes.  Then he thrusts his hand onto MICHAEL's

thigh feeling in and around, searching for a weapon.

He looks at a MAN sitting at a table opposite them;

indicating the bathroom with his eyes.  The MAN nods,

indicating no one is there.

MICHAEL gets up and calmly walks to the bathroom, and

disappears inside.

INT NITE: LUNA AZURA TOILET (WINTER 1945)

MICHAEL steps into the small bathroom; he is breathing very

hard.  He actually uses the urinal.  Then he washes his

hands with the bar of pink soap; and dries them thoroughly.

Then he moves to the booth, up to the old-fashioned toilet.

Slowly he reaches behind the water tank; he panics when he

cannot feel the gun.  We see behind the tank his hand is

just a few inches from the gun...he gropes

searchingly...finally coming to rest on the gun.

CLOSE ON MICHAEL; the feel of it reassures him.  Then he

breaks it loose from the tape holding it; he takes a deep

breath and shoves it under his waistband.  For some

unexplainable reason he hesitates once again, deliberately

washes his hands and dries them.  Then he goes out.

INT NITE: LUNA AZURA (WINTER 1945)

He hesitates by the bathroom door; and looks at his table.

McCLUSKEY is eating a plate of spaghetti and veal.  SOLLOZZO

turns around upon hearing the door, and looks directly at

MICHAEL.  MICHAEL looks back.  Then he smiles and continues

back to the table.  He sits down.

The MAN by the far wall had been stiff with attention; now

he too relaxes.  SOLLOZZO leans toward MICHAEL who sits down

comfortably and his hands move under the table and unbutton

his jacket.  SOLLOZZO begins to speak in Sicilian once again

but MICHAEL's heart is pounding so hard he can barely hear

him.

The WAITER comes to ask about the order, SOLLOZZO turns to

speak, and without warning, MICHAEL shoves the table away

from him with his left hand, and with his right hand puts

the gun right against SOLLOZZO's head, just touching his

temple.  He pulls the trigger, and we see part of SOLLOZZO's

head blown away, and a spray of fine mist of blood cover the

entire area.

The WAITER looks in amazement; suddenly his white jacket is

sprayed and stained with blood.

SOLLOZZO seems in a perpetual fall to the floor; through he

seems to hang in space suspended.

MICHAEL pivots, and looks:

There is McCLUSKEY, frozen, the fork with a piece of veal

suspended in air before his gaping mouth.

MICHAEL fires; catching McCLUSKEY in his thick bulging

throat.  He makes a horrible, gagging, choking sound.  Then

coolly, and deliberately, MICHAEL fires again, fires right

through McCLUSKEY's white-topped skull.

The air is filled with pink mist.

MICHAEL swings toward the MAN standing by the bathroom wall.

He does not make a move, seemingly paralyzed.

Now he carefully shows his hands to be empty.

The WAITER steps backward through the mist of blood, an

expression of horror on his face.

MICHAEL looks at his two victims:

SOLLOZZO still in his chair, side of his body propped up by

the table.

McCLUSKEY finally falls from the chair to the table.

MICHAEL is wildly at a peak.  He starts to move out.  His

hand: is frozen by his side, STILL GRIPPING THE GUN.

He moves, not letting the gun go.

MICHAEL's face; frozen in its expression.

His hand: still holding the gun.

His face: finally he closes his eyes.

His hand relaxes, the gun falls to the floor with a dull thud.

He walks quickly out of the restaurant, looks back.

He sees a frozen tableau of the murder; as though it had

been recreated in wax.

Then he leaves.

---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

FADE IN:

INT DAY: MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)

A MAN is his shirtsleeves plays a sentimental tune on an old

upright piano, while his cigarette burns on the edge.

ANOTHER stands nearby, listening quietly.

A little distance away, TEN MEN sit around a crude table,

quietly eating.  They talk in low, relaxed voices, and there

is an occasional laugh.

ROCCO LAMPONE stands by a window, which has been covered

with a heavy-mesh wire grating, gazing out.

A large bowl of pasta is passed, and the MEN eat heartily.

The sentimental tune is continued over the following:

INT DAY: BODIES IN CAR (WINTER 1945)

A MAN and a WOMAN, blood coming out of their noses, lie

still together in a bullet-riddled automobile.

INT DAY: BODY IN BARBER SHOP (WINTER 1945)

A MAN is covered by a sheet on the floor of a barber shop.

INT DAY: MATTRESS

Ten mattresses are spread out around the otherwise empty

living room of an apartment.  THREE or FOUR MEN including

CLEMENZA, are taking naps.

An arsenal of hand guns are spread out on a card table.

The MEN at the table continue their dinner; passing and

pouring the wine.

Trash is thrown in 2 or 3 garbage cans kept in the apartment.

INT DAY: BODY IN OFFICE (WINTER 1945)

A MAN, his clothes soaked in blood, lies on the floor of an

office building, dead, under an enormous portrait of Harry S.

Truman.

EXT DAY: BODY ON STOOP (WINTER 1945)

ANOTHER MAN, his trousers soaked in blood, lies spanning

three steps of a front stoop.

INT NITE: MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)

TESSIO, sits in a simple straight-backed chair, doing a

crossword puzzle.

A thin, boyish BUTTON MAN, writes a letter.

Six or seven empty mattresses, with tossed unmade blankets.

Coffee cans beside them serve as ash trays.

A MAN by the table pulls the cork on another bottle of

Ruffino, and wine is poured as the MEN eat.

EXT DAY: BODY IN ALLEY (WINTER 1945)

A CORPSE is half out of an overturned garbage can in a quiet

alley.

INT DAY: BODY AT TABLE (WINTER 1945)

A MAN in a formal jacket and tie is slumped over a table, in

a pool of blood on the tablecloth.

INT DAY: MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)

A neatly stacked pile of newspapers in the corner of an

apartment.  We catch a glimpse of one headline: "Five Family

War..."

The table.  The MEN are sitting around cracking nuts.  ONE

has fallen asleep on his arms at the table.

SEVERAL MEN are taking naps on the Mattresses.

The PIANO PLAYER finishes the tune with finesse.  Picks up

and takes a drag from his cigarette.  The OTHER MAN nods

appreciatively.

EXT DAY: MANCINI BLDG. (SPRING '46)

Several cars are parked in front of a pleasant New York

apartment building.  We recognize a couple of SONNY's

bodyguards loafing by the cars, pitching playing cards

against the curb.

Inside the building, two others wait quietly by the rows of

brass mailboxes: they have been there quite awhile.

Up one flight of stairs, a single man sits on the step,

smoking a cigarette.

One of the men by the mailboxes checks his pocketwatch,

which is attached to a key chain.  We HEAR the sound of a

door opening; they look up.

The man sitting on the stop stands; and looks.

SONNY backs out of an apartment, the arms of LUCY MANCINI

wrapped around him.  She doesn't want to let go of him; she

draws him back into the apartment for a moment, and then he

comes out alone, adjusting his clothes.

He jauntily skips down the steps, trailed by the bodyguard

on the first floor, and moves outside toward his car.  The

men quickly take up their positions.  As he gets in his car:

The car drives off; accompanied and escorted by the

bodyguards in their cars.

INT DAY: CONNIE'S HALL (SPRING '46)

He knocks on the door.  No answer.  Then again.

We hear the bolt slide back, and see the door open.  SONNY

enters, but CONNIE has quickly moved into the hallway, her

back to him.

He turns her around in his arms.

Her face is swollen and bruised; and we can tell from her

rough, red eyes that she has been crying for a long time.

As soon as he realizes what's happened, his face goes red

with rage.  She sees it coming, and clings to him, preventing

him from running out of the apartment.

Sonny listens, and calms himself.  He touches her shoulder,

the thin silk robe.

He starts to leave.

He stops, and then laughs good naturedly.

She laughs with him.  He kisses her reassuringly, and leaves.

EXT DAY: CONNIE'S STREET

CARLO settles down on the front steps of the 112th St.

"Book" with SALLY RAGS and COACH, who have been drinking

beer out of glasses and a pitcher of beer from around the

corner.  The ball game is blaring from the radio; and the

kids on the street are still playing stickball.

CARLO has barely settled down, when the kids in the street

suddenly scatter, and a car comes screeching up the block

and to a halt in front of the candy store.  The tires

scream, and before it seems as though it has even stopped, a

MAN comes hurtling out of the driver's seat, moving so fast

the everyone is paralyzed.  It is a moment before we

recognize that it is SONNY.

His face is contorted with anger; in a split second he is on

the stoop and has CARLO by the throat.

He pulls CARLO away from the others, trying to get him down

into the street.  But CARLO reaches out for the iron railing,

and hangs on, his hand in a lock, cringing away, trying to

hide his head and face in the hollow of the his shoulders.

His shirt is ripped away in SONNY's hand.

SALLY RAGS and COACH, merely sit, watching, stunned.

SONNY is pounding the cowered CARLO with all his strength,

in a continuous monologue of indistinguishable cursing.  His

blows are powerful; and begin to draw blood.

The kids who have been playing stickball, move up, watching

in fascination.

CARLO's hands are clenched tight around the railing.

SONNY beats him mercilessly.

Now SONNY's bodyguards' car pulls up, and they too become

spectators.

SONNY's tight fists are going down like hammers, into

CARLO's face and body.

CARLO's nose is bleeding profusely; but still he does

nothing, other than hang onto the railing.

SONNY grabs hold of CARLO's massive body, and tries to drag

him off of the hold on the railing, his teeth clenched in

the effort.  Then he tries loosening CARLO's locked hands;

even biting them.  CARLO screams but he does not let go.

It's clear that CARLO is much stronger than he is, and will

not be moved.  SONNY knees him in the mouth, and beats him

more; but he is exhausted.  Totally out of breath, he

stammers haltingly to the bleeding CARLO.

He wipes the sweat from his face, and then turns suddenly.

and hurries back to the car, in a moment his car is gone,

leaving even his bodyguards in confusion.  We notice ONE MAN

with a sports jacket in the group of spectators especially

interested.

CARLO finally relaxes the clenched, locked hands.  He slumps

onto the stoop.

FADE IN:

EXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1946)

HIGH ANGLE on the Corleone Mall.  It is a gray, rainy day.

Young BUTTON MEN in raincoats stand in quiet groups of

various points around the main house and compound.  Things

have changed; one house has been extensively enlarged; a new

and secure gate house has been built.  Security measures

that had been make-shift and temporarily have now been made

a permanent part of the Mall, evolving it into a Medieval

Fortress.  We notice a huge crater in the courtyard; the

result of a recent bomb attempt.  The house nearest the

crater is damaged by fire.

A taxi arrives; KAY ADAMS steps out, huddled in a bright

yellow raincoat; she lets the cab go, and hurries to the

shelter of the gate house.

They are not expecting her, and ask her to wait while they

call the main house.

KAY looks at the imposing, depressing Mall, while rain still

runs down onto her face.

She notices the bomb crater, and the fire damage; and the

sullen faces of the BUTTON MEN.

TOM HAGEN exits the Main House, and hurries toward her.

KAY looks in the direction of the crater, filling with

rainwater.

TOM is clearly reluctant to involve her any more than he has

to.

They hurry through the rain and into the Main House.

INT DAY: DON'S LIVING ROOM (SPRING 1946)

In the living room, KAY shakes the water from her coat and

takes her rainhat off.

We hear footsteps descending the staircase; MAMA CORLEONE

enters the room; the OLD WOMAN squints at KAY, evaluating her.

KAY nods yes; there are still tears in her eyes.

KAY shakes her head.

HAGEN shrugs helplessly; on an impulse, KAY quickly moves

toward MAMA, the letter extended.

She takes the letter from KAY, who is grateful and relieved.

She looks directly into KAY's eyes; and KAY understands what

that means.

EXT DAY: DON'S HOSPITAL (SPRING 1946)

A hospital in New York City.  POLICE and teams of PRIVATE

DETECTIVES are stationed guarding the area.  An ambulance

with a team of DETECTIVES and BUTTON-MEN GUARDS exit the

hospital with rifles in hand; followed by SEVERAL HOSPITAL

ASSISTANTS wheeling a hospital stretcher, presumably carrying

the DON.

TESSIO and CLEMENZA emerge, with OTHER BUTTON MEN bringing

up the rear.  HAGEN walks with the stretcher, and for a

moment they disappear behind the ambulance.  Then suddenly,

siren blasting, it speeds off, accompanied by dark low-slung

cars.

EXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1946)

The Corleone Mall.

Equally impressive security stands ready at the Corleone

Mall.  EXTRA BUTTON MEN, as well as SOME POLICE, and PRIVATE

DETECTIVES.

It all seems to be under the supervision of ROCCO LAMPONE.

All is silent.  The WOMEN and CHILDREN, dressed in Sunday

clothes, wait.

EXT DAY: AMBULANCE (SPRING 1946)

One ambulance, speeding along the Grand Central Parkway,

preceded and followed by a dark car, each one carrying a

team of BUTTON MEN.

Sitting next to the DRIVER of the ambulance is a GUARD with

a rifle on his lap.

INT DAY: DON'S HALL (SPRING 1946)

Inside the Main CORLEONE House:

Hospital ORDERLIES carry the DON on his stretcher carefully

under the watchful eyes of CLEMENZA, TESSIO, LAMPONE and

various GUARDS and BUTTON MEN.

All the CORLEONE family is here today: MAMA, FREDO, SANDRA,

THERESA, CONNIE, CARLO; the various CORLEONE CHILDREN.

INT DAY: DON'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946)

The DON is made comfortable in his room, which has all but

been converted into a hospital room, with complete and

extensive equipment.  The various CHILDREN get a turn to

kiss the OLD MAN, as he is made comfortable... and then

SONNY indicates that all the CHILDREN, WOMEN, and CARLO

should leave.

They do, the door is closed.

INT DAY: DON'S DINING ROOM (SPRING 1946)

The mood is quite happy downstairs, as the WOMEN prepare the

Sunday dinner, and set the table.

CARLO sits alone among them, a frown on his face.

INT DAY: DON'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946)

All the MEN of the family stand around the hospital bed with

grim faces, SONNY and HAGEN closest to the OLD MAN.  The DON

does not speak, yet he asks questions with his looks and

glances, as clearly as if they were verbalized.  HAGEN is

the spokesman for the family.

The OLD MAN glances at SONNY.

The OLD MAN nods.

The DON nods approvingly.  Then he searches around the room

for a face he does not see.  HAGEN knows who he's looking for.

The DON closes his eyes, and then reopens them in anger and

rage.

The DON is very angry, he motions with a weak hand that they

leave him alone.

INT. DAY: DON'S STAIRS AND HALL (SPRING 1946)

HAGEN is very upset as he comes down the Stairs; SONNY is

expansive and optimistic.

INT DAY: DON'S DINING ROOM (SPRING 1946)

The FAMILY, WIVES, CHILDREN and all sit around the table

over Sunday dinner.  SONNY is at the head of the table.

EXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1946)

SOME of the CORLEONE GRANDCHILDREN play in the enclosed

Mall, in the proximity of the BUTTON MEN stationed liberally

by the gate.

ONE CHILD misses a ball, it rolls by the gate house.  A

young BUTTON MAN scoops it up and throws it back, smiling.

-----------------------------------------FADE OUT-------

INT DAY: CONNIE'S APT. (SPRING 1946)

CONNIE and CARLO's apartment.  She's in a slip, on the phone.

We HEAR the shower going in the bathroom.

CONNIE's face turns red.

She slams the phone down; just as CARLO is coming out of the

bathroom drying his golden body.

She hauls off and punches him knowingly; he laughs, so then

she flings herself at him, kicking and scratching; her heavy

belly heaving under the thin slip.

He pushes her aside, and moves into the bedroom to continue

dressing.

That calms her down; she stands there a moment, breathing

heavily; and then she nods, and goes into the kitchen, and

starts her wifely duties.

CARLO is dressed; puts on some cologne; CONNIE appears in

the doorway.

She turns deliberately, goes out into the kitchen.  A moment

later we begin to hear the sound of dishes breaking.  CARLO

slowly walks out, where we can see CONNIE systematically

smashing all the dishes against the sink, sending the greasy

veal and peppers all over the apartment floor.

She stands there, solid, ready to punch him again.  Slowly,

he slides his belt out of his trousers, and doubles it in

his hand.

He swings the belt against her heavy hips.  She moves back

into the kitchen, and gets a kitchen knife, and holds it

ready.

He puts the strap down on a table, and moves after her.  She

makes a sudden thrust at his groin, which he avoids.  He

pulls the knife away, cutting his hand in the process.  She

gets away momentarily, but he pursues her around the table,

gets her; and starts to slap her in the face.

She breaks away from him, and rushes into the bedroom.

INT DAY: CONNIE'S BEDROOM  (SPRING 1946)

She runs into the bedroom; he follows.  She moves into a

corner, and then like a desperate animal, tries to hide

under the bed.

He reaches under, and pulls her out by the hair.

He slaps her in the face until she begins to weep; then he

throws her on the bed, contemptuously.  He grabs part of her

thigh, pinching it very hard.

Then he pushes her away, and walks out of the room, leaving

her in tears.  She is crying; she pulls herself to the

bedroom phone, and in a whisper:

We can tell that the phone has been passed to SONNY.

INT DAY: DON'S KITCHEN (SPRING 1946)

In the kitchen at the Mall, MAMA cannot understand the

whispering and she has given the phone to SONNY.

SONNY's face is turning red.

He hangs up the phone; and just stands there for a moment.

HAGEN enters the room; he knows what is happening, knows he

cannot interfere.

EXT DAY: MALL

SONNY leaves the house.  HAGEN moves to the outside mall

just as SONNY's car is driving off.  He moves to a group of

BUTTON MEN.

EXT DAY: CAUSEWAY (SPRING 1946)

SONNY's car on the Jones Beach Causeway, speeds quickly by.

After a pause, another car, with the CORLEONE BODYGUARDS, is

trailing.

SONNY is driving; he is very angry.

EXT NITE: TOLL BOOTHS (SPRING 1946)

SONNY in his car; driving back.  Still breathing hard and

still furious.  Then he thinks it's funny; he enjoyed it.

He starts laughing, louder and louder, as he pulls up to a

toll booth, stops, and extends his hand with a coin to the

COLLECTOR.

---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

FADE IN:

INT NITE: AMERIGO BONASERA'S APARTMENT

The serious-faced UNDERTAKER is on the telephone.

BONASERA looks at his WIFE, with deep anxiety in his eyes.

BONASERA's lips are suddenly dry.

Silence.  BONASERA stutters, then speaks in fright.

BONASERA is sweating; slowly he lowers the phone; his WIFE

sees his pale expression, and follows him into the room.

Silently, he begins the ritual of dressing.  His WIFE knows

something serious is happening, and never takes her eyes

from him.  He lights a cigarette.

He slips into his trousers.  Then he moves to his WIFE to

tie his tie, as she has done for years.

EXT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR (SPRING 1946)

With his ring of keys, he opens the funeral parlor, enters.

INT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR (SPRING 1946)

BONASERA walks through the darkened funeral parlor, without

turning on the lights; then into the rear, preparation room,

past the tables, and equipment.  He operates the chain that

lifts a large overhead garage type door.  And looks out into

the alley.

He sits on a bench, and waits.

EXT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR ALLEY (SPRING 1946)

The tires of a car roll very quietly along the small alley;

we notice a dark car approach the rear of BONASERA's funeral

parlor.

CLEMENZA gets out, and moves to the open, rear door.

BONASERA greets him, too petrified to speak.  He notices TWO

OTHER MEN get out of the car, and carry a stretcher with a

CORPSE swaddled in a gray blanket, with yellowed feet

protruding.

BONASERA closes his eyes in fear, but indicates which way

the MEN should carry their sinister burden.

INT NITE: FUNERAL PARLOR EMBALMING ROOM (SPRING 1946)

They carry the CORPSE to one of the tables in the embalming

room.

Then BONASERA turns to see ANOTHER MAN step out of the

darkness somewhat uncertainly.  It is DON CORLEONE.

He walks up to BONASERA, very close, without speaking.  His

cold eyes looking directly at the frightened UNDERTAKER.

Then, after a long gaze:

BONASERA nods.  The DON moves to the CORPSE on the embalming

table; he makes a gesture, and the OTHER MEN leave them alone.

He draws down the gray blanket.

BONASERA lets out a gasp of horror at what he sees:

The bullet-smashed face of SONNY CORLEONE.

EXT NITE: TOLL BOOTHS (SPRING 1946)

SONNY extends his hand with a coin at the toll booth.

A car suddenly swerves in front of him, trapping him in the

booth, and in incredible rally of machine gun fire greets

him, coming through and smashing the windows of the toll

booths on both side of him, and from the front window of the

car blocking him.

The windows of his car are shot out.

Bullet holes puncture the doors of his car.

His hand, with the coin in it, falls inside the car.

His arms, shoulders are riddled by the fire, and still it

continues, as though the ASSASSINS cannot take a chance that

he will survive it.

Suddenly, he lets out an enormous ROAR, like a bull, and

actually, opens the door, and steps out of the car, UNDER

fire.

His face is hit; and finally he falls to the ground.

A FULL SHOT...as the ASSASSINS scramble for their cars and

make off in the distance.

SONNY's BODYGUARDS stop a safe distance away, realizing they

are too late.

INT NITE: DON'S LIVING ROOM (SPRING 1946)

View on HAGEN's ashen face in the living room.  He is silent

a moment, and then:

The MEN leave him alone.  He is quiet, standing in the

middle of the living room a moment.  He looks in the

direction of the kitchen, where he can see fragments of MAMA

moving around.

INT NITE: UPSTAIRS (SPRING 1946)

TOM proceeds up stairs, and quietly in the direction of the

DON's room.  He opens the DON's door.  Looks in.

INT NITE: DON'S BEDROOM (SPRING 1946)

The DON in his hospital bed.  Asleep under sedation.  HAGEN

hesitates.  He cannot go in; he cannot tell the OLD MAN.  He

closes the door.

INT NITE: DON'S OFFICE (SPRING 1946)

HAGEN alone in the office.  He is drinking.  He looks up at

the sound of cars; the CAPOREGIMES are arriving.  Then he

hears footsteps.

The door opens; and in a robe, with slippers, DON CORLEONE

slowly enters the room.  He walks directly to his stuffed

armchair, sits down.  His face is stern, as he looks into

HAGEN's eyes.

HAGEN rises, and pours a glass for the OLD MAN.

Pause.

DON CORLEONE blinks.  One feels that just for a second he

loses all physical strength; he clasps his hands in front of

him on the top of the desk and looks into HAGEN's eyes.

He rises and unsteadily leaves the room, turns...

And leaves.  HAGEN moves to the phone; dials...

EXT DAY: BANK BUILDING (SPRING 1946)

Day in Manhattan.  An impressive Bank Building in the

financial center of New York.  Many limousines are parked,

uniforms and plain-clothed CHAUFFEURS waiting quietly.

INT DAY: BOARD ROOM (SPRING 1946)

The Board Room of a bank, daylight shines in the windows.

CARLO TRAMONTI, an impressive, handsome middle-aged man,

sits quietly, smoking a Di Napoli cigar, OUR VIEW moves to a

MAN sitting to his left, and a little to the rear, and

settles on JOSEPH ZALUCHI, a moon-faced amiable-looking man;

as the view continues, around the table, we HEAR:

The VIEW PASSES to FRANK FALCONE and ANTHONY MOLINARI, both

younger than any of the others; then on to DOMENICK PANZA,

short and squat sitting in a wheelchair; then around the

table to DON VINCENENZO FORLENZA, who is whispering to his

JEWISH ASSISTANT; the VIEW PASSES on to ANTHONY STRACCI, an

older man, sipping from a drink and smoking a cigar; OTTILIO

CUNEO, in his middle sixties with a jolly round face; then

DON PHILLIP TATTAGLIA, a delicate older man with dyed hair

and a pencil mustache; and finally, EMILIO BARZINI, in his

early sixties, a man to 'respect'; whom we had seen at

CONNIE's Wedding.

The VIEW examines the room once again, as the DON speaks.  A

large, clicking board is changing numbers at various times,

and two tapes, showing the fluctuations of the Market during

the day's trading, and projected above.

DON CORLEONE pauses; and TOM HAGEN hands him a cold drink.

DON CORLEONE nods.

They all look at the DON; especially HAGEN, who feels that

DON CORLEONE has given a great deal, and must have something

else in mind.  Slowly the DON rises.

EXT NITE: DON'S LIMO (SPRING 1946)

The DON's black limousine.  He sits quietly in the padded

rear seat; TOM HAGEN next to him.

It is night.  Lights flash by them every so often.

The black limousine speeds away from us in the night.

------------------------------------------FADE OUT------

FADE IN:

EXT DAY: ESTABLISHING SICILY SHOT

A CLOSE VIEW OF MICHAEL, moving as he walks, sullen and

downcast, the left side of his face healed, but left

grotesque and misshapen.

GRADUALLY, THE VIEW LOOSENS, he wears a warm navy Pea

jacket, and walks with his hands in his pockets.

THE VIEW LOOSENS FURTHER, revealing a Sicilian SHEPHERD on

either side of him, each carrying a shotgun slung over his

shoulder, CALO, a squat and husky young man with a simple

honest quality, and FABRIZZIO, slender and handsome, likable,

and with a pleasing build.  Each of the SHEPHERDS  carry

knapsacks.

The THREE YOUNG MEN continue over the Sicilian landscape,

overlooking an impressive view of land and sea.

EXT DAY: SICILY ROAD

The THREE move through a flock of wind-blown sheep, and make

their way to a dusty rural road.  We HEAR a rinky horn

sound, as a pre-war Italian automobile makes its way to them.

An OLD MAN peeks from the window, waving to MICHAEL.  The

car pulls in front of them and stops.  MICHAEL nods

respectfully.

DON TOMMASSINO thinks a moment, then concedes.

The OLD MAN sighs, and then returns to his car.

The old car sputters off; MICHAEL watches, and then continues

on his journey.

EXT DAY: COUNTRYSIDE

The THREE pass through abundant areas of flowers and fruit

trees, in bloom and bursting with life.

EXT DAY: VILLAGE

They continue in the empty streets of a little town; the

post-war poverty is evident in the skinny dogs; and the

empty streets.  Occasionally, a military vehicle, the only

gasoline-powered vehicles on the road, will pass.  And there

are many POLICE evident, most of them carrying machine guns.

The THREE pass under an enormous banner slung over the main

road "VOTA COMMUNISTA".

EXT DAY: COUNTRY ROAD

They continue through dusty country roads, where occasionally

a donkey pulling a cart, or a lone horseman will pass them.

EXT DAY: FIELD

Out in a field, in the distance, they come upon a procession

of peasants and activists, perhaps two hundred strong,

marching, and singing, and in the lead, are five or six men

carrying billowing red banners.

EXT DAY: GROVE

They are in an orange grove; on the other side of the trees

is a deep, tall field of wild flowers.

The Shepherds unsling their guns and knapsacks, and take out

loaves of bread, some wine, sausage and cheese.

MICHAEL rests against a tree, and uses his handkerchief.

MICHAEL laughs.

EXT DAY: ANOTHER ROAD

The TRIO continues down a dirt road, as an American Military

convoy speeds by; FABRIZZIO waves, and calls out to each of

the U.S. drivers, as they move by.

EXT DAY: CORLEONE HILL

They continue their long hike, high on a promentory; until

they hesitate, and look down.

They can see a grim Sicilian village, almost devoid of people.

EXT DAY: CORLEONE STREET

MICHAEL and his bodyguards move through the empty streets of

the village.  They walk behind him, and spread to either

side about fifteen feet away from him.

They move down ancient steps, past an old stone fountain.

MICHAEL hesitates, cups his hands and drinks some water.

They go on.

They move up a very narrow old street.  MICHAEL looks at the

doorways that they pass.

MOVING VIEW: Each door has a plaque, with a ribbon or flower.

CALO sees MICHAEL looking.

MICHAEL hesitates in the center of the main street.  He looks.

The street is empty, barren.  Occasionally, an old woman

will pass.

MICHAEL turns his head.

The other side of the street: empty and deathly.

A HIGH VIEW of MICHAEL standing in the center of the old

street, the shepherds a respectful distance away.

-------------------------------------FADE OUT-----------

EXT DAY: BARONIAL ESTATE

A green ribboned field of a baronial Estate.  Further ahead

is a villa so Roman it looks as though it had just been

discovered in the ruins of Pompeii.  There is a group of

young village GIRLS accompanied by two stocky MATRONS,

dressed in black.  They have been gathering the pink sulla,

purple wisteria, and mixing them with orange and lemon

blossoms.  They are singing, off in the distance as they work.

MICHAEL, CALO and FABRIZZIO are silent as they watch this

Fantasy-like scene.

He settles down to watch.

The GIRLS are dressed in cheap gaily painted frocks that

cling to their bodies.  They are still in their teens, but

developed and womanly.

They are moving along the fields, picking blossoms, not

aware of the three men watching them from the orange grove.

Three or four of the girls begin chasing one of them

playfully, in the direction of the grove.

The GIRL being chased holds a bunch of purple grapes in her

left hand and with the right, picks more grapes, and throws

them back at her pursuers laughing.

They come closer and closer.  Just short of the grove, she

poses, startled, her large, oval shaped eyes catching the

view of the THREE MEN.  She stands there on her toes about

to run.

MICHAEL sees her; now face to face.  He looks.

Her face.  Incredibly beautiful with olive skin, black hair

and a rich mouth.

Quickly, she turns, and runs away.

MICHAEL stands up never taking his eyes from her.  We hold

on him for a long while; and eventually hear the SHEPHERDS

laughing.  Then he turns to them.

CALO pats him on the shoulder.

EXT DAY: BARONIAL VILLAGE

The little village built attendant to the Baronial Estate,

is decked with the flowers the girls had been picking.

MICHAEL, followed by the bodyguards, moves into the central

square, and onto the balcony of a little cafe.

The proprietor of the cafe, VITELLI, is a short burly man;

he greets them cheerfully, and sets a dish of chickpeas at

their table.

VITELLI gives a big knowing laugh, and looks at MICHAEL with

new interest.

VITELLI does not laugh quite so much.

VITELLI is no longer drinking with them.

As MICHAEL describes her, VITELLI laughed less and less,

until he wears a scowl.

Then he curtly leaves him, and walks into the back room.

He goes into the back room after the innkeeper.  Then he

returns.

They start to leave; but MICHAEL doesn't move.

MICHAEL turns to FABRIZZIO with his cold authority.

The two BODYGUARDS shoulder their luparas, and disappear in

a moment they return with the red-faced angry VITELLI

between them.

CALO and FABRIZZIO are impressed.

CALO and FABRIZZIO are stupefied; VITELLI pauses, and then

asks:

-------------------------------------FADE OUT-----------

EXT DAY: TOMMASSINO COURTYARD

MUSIC comes up; as MICHAEL, dressed in new clothes from

Palermo, and carrying a stack of wrapped gifts, gets into an

Alfa Romeo.  CALO and FABRIZZIO each dressed in their Sunday

best, are in the rear seat, huddled together, with their

luparas on their shoulders.

DON TOMMASSINO waves them off, as the little car drives off,

rocky and bouncing on the dirt road.

The Sunday churchbells ring.

--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------

EXT DAY: VITELLI HOUSE

MICHAEL is presented to each of the Vitelli relatives, by

the yard of their little hilltop house; the BROTHERS; the

MOTHER, who is given a gift; several UNCLES and AUNTS.

Finally APPOLONIA enters, dressed beautifully in appropriate

Sunday clothing.  Now he presents the wrapped gift to

APPOLONIA.  She looks at her MOTHER, who with a nod gives

her permission to open it.  She unwraps it.  Her eyes light

at the sight of a heavy gold chain; to be worn as a necklace.

She looks at him.

--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------

EXT DAY: VITELLI CAFE

Now the little Alpha drives into the village near VITELLI's

cafe.

MICHAEL is, as ever, accompanied with his two BODYGUARDS,

though they are all dressed differently.

They go up to the cafe...and sit with VITELLI, who is

talking and talking.

MICHAEL looks at APPOLONIA; who sits, respectfully quiet.

She wears the gold necklace around her neck.

--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------

EXT DAY: HILLTOP NEAR VITELLI HOME

MICHAEL and APPOLONIA are walking through a hilltop path,

seemingly alone, although a respectful distance apart.

As the VIEW PANS with them, we notice that her MOTHER and a

half dozen AUNTS are twenty paces behind them, and ten paces

further behind are CALO and FABRIZZIO, their luparas on

their shoulders.

Further up the hill, APPOLONIA stumbles on a loose stone,

and falls briefly onto MICHAEL's arm.  She modestly regains

her balance, and they continue walking.

Behind them, her MOTHER giggles to herself.

--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------

EXT DAY: VITELLI VILLAGE CHURCH

Church bells in an ancient belfry ring out.  Music, old and

dissonant, plays.

There is a bridal procession in the street of the village;

the same in feeling and texture as it might have been five

hundred years ago.

Donkeys and other animals have been decorated with abundant

flowers; children carrying candles and wearing white

confirmation gowns walk in the procession, followed by

countless townspeople, members of the clergy, even the police.

We present the entire bridal procession and ceremony with

all the ritual and pageantry, as it has always been, in

Sicily.

APPOLONIA is radiant as the Bride; MICHAEL is handsome

despite the grotesque jaw and occasional white handkerchief.

--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------

EXT NITE: VITELLI VILLAGE SQUARE

CALO and FABRIZZIO dance wildly through the night of the

great wedding celebration.  It is held in the Village

Square; under the watchful eyes of SHEPHERDS above on the

tops of buildings, carrying luparas.

--------------------------------------DISSOLVE----------

INT NITE: MICHAEL'S ROOM IN VILLA

MICHAEL opens the shutters in his darkened room; moonlight

fills the room.

He turns, and there, in her wedding slip, is APPOLONIA.  A

little frightened; but lovely.

He moves to her; and for a moment just stands before her,

looking at her incredible face; her lovely hair and body.

Slowly and tenderly he kisses her.  Her tiny hands come up

to his face; touch his cheek and embrace him.

She lets her bridal slip fall to the floor.

--------------------------------------FADE OUT----------

INT DAY: MICHAEL'S ROOM AT VILLA

Morning.  MICHAEL sits on the window ledge, gazing into the

room.

APPOLONIA is asleep; she is naked, and only partially

covered by the bedsheets.

He looks at her for a long time in the early morning light.

EXT DAY: TOMMASSINO COURTYARD

HIGH ANGLE ON DON TOMMASSINO'S VILLA

We HEAR girlish laughter; the little Alpha is driving

erratically, knocking down an occasional wall, and almost

hitting th inner court wall.

APPOLONIA is laughing, driving.  MICHAEL pretends to be

frightened, as he teaches her to drive.

Outside the walls, we notice SHEPHERDS with luparas, walking

guard duty.

The car stops and a laughing MICHAEL gets out.

DON TOMMASSINO enters the Courtyard.  He seems tired and

concerned.

APPOLONIA kisses him.

For a moment, the whole world of New York, Sollozzo, the

Five Family War, all comes back to MICHAEL.

EXT DAY: VILLA COURTYARD

Morning.  MICHAEL leans out of the bedroom window.

Below, FABRIZZIO is sitting in one of the garden chairs,

combing his thick hair.

MICHAEL whistles and FABRIZZIO looks up to his window.

INT DAY: VILLA KITCHEN

MICHAEL, dressed, crosses from the hallway, and into the

kitchen.  CALO is just finishing a bite.  He rises when he

sees MICHAEL.

MICHAEL smiles.

He leaves the kitchen, after a quick sip of coffee.

He looks out from the opening in the doorway.

EXT DAY: VILLA COURTYARD

There is the car, with APPOLONIA sitting in the driver's

seat, playing with the wheel like a child.

CALO moves to the car, and puts a lunch basket in the rear

seat.

Then MICHAEL seems disturbed.

Over, on the other side of the courtyard, he sees FABRIZZIO

disappear through the gate.

MICHAEL goes down the hallway, and outside.

MICHAEL steps out into the bright sunlight of the outer

courtyard, causing him to shade his eyes.

APPOLONIA sees him, and waves, motioning that he should stay

where he is.

He smiles affectionately.

CALO stands beside the car, smiling, with his lupara dangling

by his side.  There is no sight of FABRIZZIO.  Suddenly the

smile fades from MICHAEL's face.  He steps forward and holds

out his hand.

His shout is drowned in the roar of a tremendous EXPLOSION,

as she switched on the ignition.

Part of the wall is caved in, the kitchen door is blown off;

and there is nothing left of the Alpha, or of Appolonia.

MICHAEL is thrown against the wall, and knocked unconscious.

INT DAY: VILLA BEDROOM

MICHAEL is unconscious in a darkened room.  We hear

whispering around him, but can't make any of it out.  A soft

cloth is applied to his face; gradually his eyes open.  DON

TOMMASSINO is there, close to him.  He looks at them and

from their grave expressions, he knows his wife is dead.

--------------------------------------FADE OUT----------

FADE IN:

EXT DAY: MALL (SPRING 1951)

Easter.

A HIGH VIEW ON THE CORLEONE MALL in the springtime.  Hordes

of little CHILDREN including many of the Corleone Children

and Grandchilren, rush about carrying little Easter baskets,

searching here and there for candy treasures and hidden

Easter eggs.

The DON himself, much older, much smaller in size, wearing

baggy pants and a plaid shirt and an old hat, moves around

his garden, tending rows and rows of rich tomato plants.

Suddenly, he stops and looks.

MICHAEL stands there, still holding his suitcase.

Great emotion comes over the DON, who takes a few steps in

MICHAEL's direction.

MICHAEL leaves his suitcase and walks to his favorite son

and embraces him.

INT DAY: THE OLIVE OIL FACTORY

DON CORLEONE leads MICHAEL through the corridors of the

building.

They enter the DON's glass-panelled office.

MICHAEL doesn't answer.

MICHAEL listens.

--------------------------------------FADE OUT----------

EXT DAY: STOCK FOOTAGE LAS VEGAS (1955)

A MOVING VIEW, driving up the Las Vegas Strip of 1955.

MORE VIEWS, showing new hotels and casinos being built; the

bill marquees read: "MARTIN AND LEWIS", "PATTI PAGE", etc.

EXT DAY: FLAMINGO (1955)

The car pulls up at the Flamingo Hotel.

Inside the car: MICHAEL, FREDO, TOM HAGEN and a new man,

NERI, quiet and sinister.

From the expression on MICHAEL's face we know this is a

discourtesy.

INT DAY: FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE (1955)

A whole entourage precedes FREDO and his V.I.P. party of

MICHAEL, HAGEN and NERI.  Great fuss is made.  They are

being shown into the hotel's 'special' suite.

They enter the suite.

FREDO is as excited as a kid, snapping orders at the

bellboys, waiters and maids.

MICHAEL gives a look to HAGEN, and continues into the bedroom.

There is an enormous circular bed on a huge platform,

mirrors to each side.  FREDO points upward.

A VIEW into a large CEILING mirror.

INT NITE: FLAMINGO SUITE BEDROOM (1955)

MICHAEL is alone in the bedroom.  He is just finishing

dressing; he puts on his jacket.  From the window, with the

lights blinking, we can tell it's late at night.  MICHAEL

passes into the other room.

He stops, looks.  He is disturbed.

INT NITE: FLAMINGO SUITE (1955)

A magnificent, circular table has been set up in his suite;

a lavish table setting for eight.  Standing by the table are

HAGEN, JOHNNY FONTANE, looking wonderful, a little heavier,

beautifully dressed; FREDO, a dandy, and TWO LAS VEGAS GIRLS.

NERI stands quietly by the door.

FREDO goes to him, a big smile all over his face.

INT NITE: FLAMINGO SUITE (1955)

They are seated around the lavish table in Michael's suite.

MICHAEL is speaking to JOHNNY.

FREDDIE seems anxious.

MICHAEL turns to JOHNNY.

There is knock on the door.  NERI rises, looks at MICHAEL,

who nods.  NERI opens the door, and MOE GREENE enters,

followed by TWO BODYGUARDS.  He is a handsome hood, dressed

in the Hollywood style.  His BODYGUARDS are more West Coast

style.

MOE laughs.

GREENE stops laughing; the room becomes tense.  NERI eyes

the BODYGUARDS.

MICHAEL rises from his chair, and says in a tone of dismissal:

Nobody answers.  MICHAEL nods to NERI, who opens the door.

MOE exits angrily.

EXT DAY: N.Y. AIRPORT (1955)

KAY sits in the back of a limousine parked by the Newark

AIRPORT.  ROCCO LAMPONE is leaning against it.

She has a little three year old boy; MICHAEL's son, who

plays with a cardboard bird on a string.

Two other cars are stationed discreetly, with men we have

learned to tell are bodyguards.

MICHAEL, HAGEN and NERI exit the airport with TWO NEGRO

PORTERS carrying luggage.

NERI sees something, and taps MICHAEL on the shoulder.

MICHAEL turns, and sees KAY.

LAMPONE opens the car door; KAY steps out with the BOY, and

MICHAEL embraces her, and kisses his son.  Automatically,

the luggage is put in.  NERI replaces LAMPONE as the driver;

and LAMPONE joins the other men.  HAGEN gets into one of the

other cars.

And the limo drives off, preceded and followed by the other

sedans.

INT DAY: LIMO (1955)

The little BOY looks out the window as they drive.

The little BOY flies his cardboard bird out of the speeding

limousine window.

EXT DAY: MALL (1955)

The limousine arrives at the Mall.  We are inside.

NERI opens the door.  KAY wants to talk just a little more.

MICHAEL nods to NERI; who gives them their privacy a moment

longer.

NERI opens the door; MICHAEL starts to get out; KAY too.

He smiles at her, tired, and a little sad.

She smiles; MICHAEL goes with NERI to the Main House; KAY

and the little BOY move to the house that was Sonny's.

INT DAY: DON'S OFFICE (1955)

VIEW ON DON CORLEONE, much older, much smaller in size.  He

wears baggy pants, and a warm plaid shirt.  He sits in a

chair, gazing out through the window, into the garden.

The OLD MAN looks up.  CLEMENZA stand before him in the Den.

Beside him is an anxious TESSIO.  NERI stands by the door;

HAGEN is seated; MICHAEL sits behind the big desk.

Everyone is a bit surprised; look to see HAGEN's reaction.

He remains inexpressive.

There are uneasy looks all around.

He looks at CLEMENZA, TESSIO and HAGEN.  They all nod,

reluctantly.

NERI knows the meeting is over, he opens the Den's door.

CLEMENZA and TESSIO pay their respects to the DON and leave,

then CARLO.  NERI watches CARLO as he walks down the

corridor, casting a nervous look back at the sinister man.

Then NERI closes the door.

MICHAEL relaxes.

TOM pauses, thinks...and then he nods in acquiescence.  TOM

leaves.

MICHAEL looks at NERI.

NERI nods, and then leaves.  The DON opens the doors,

breathes in the air, and steps outside.

EXT DAY: THE GARDEN (1955)

They walk through the DON's vegetable garden.  Tomatoes,

peppers, carefully tended, and covered with a silky netting.

MICHAEL follows; the DON turns and looks at him.  Then

stoops over to right a tomato plant that had been pushed over.

He rises, and looks at Michael...

The DON walks on further.

MICHAEL wants to express something...hesitates, then:

A long silence.  The DON smiles at MICHAEL.

EXT DAY: CHURCH (1955)

KAY and MAMA walking from the black car that has just left

them off.

She stops toward the Church.

KAY shakes her head.

KAY laughs and follows MAMA up the steps of the Church.

They enter.

INT DAY: CHURCH (1955)

Inside the Church, KAY watches as MAMA blesses herself from

the holy water.

Tentatively, KAY dips her fingers into the water, and

blesses herself.  Then SHE follows MAMA down the aisle, in

awe at the high ceiling, the art, the windows, and finally

the Altar.

MAMA stops by the impressive tiers of candles.  There is a

large coin box for those who wish to pay for lighting

candles.  MAMA fumbles in her purse for change; KAY gives

her some.

MAMA drops the coins in the box, one by one; then takes the

taper, and in a pattern known only to her, and with great

dignity, she closes her eyes, says a prayer, and then lights

twenty candles.

She finishes, and bows her head.

EXT DAY: BONASERA'S FUNERAL HOME

Very few people in the streets.  TOTAL SILENCE.  But black

flower cars as far as the eye can see, for blocks and blocks.

An expression of respect, of honor and fear that is enormous.

Certainly no more could be done for a President or a King.

Each car carries an elaborate floral decoration.  We show

these in detail; and the flowered messages: "A Benefactor to

Mankind", "He Knew and Pitied"..."Our Don Our Leader"..."The

Sacred Heart"...

EXT DAY: MALL (1955)

HIGH ANGLE ON THE CORLEONE MALL

Silence.

The flower cars, funeral limousines, and private cars fill

all the areas attendant to the Corleone residence.

Hundreds of people fill the Mall, reminiscent in size of the

wedding of Connie and Carlo; of course, now the mood is

somber and respectful.

MICHAEL, MAMA, FREDO and HAGEN stand by the flowered platform

which holds the ornate coffin.  We cannot see the remains of

Don Corleone.

BONASERA is nearby, ready to do service to the bereaved

family.  One by one the mourners come by, weeping, or merely

with grave expressions; pay their respects and continue on.

The VIEW ALTERS,

and we see that the line is endless.  JOHNNY FONTANE, tears

openly falling, takes his turn.

Children are taken by the hand, and lifted for their last

look at the great man.

CLEMENZA whispers into the ear of LAMPONE.  LAMPONE

immediately arranges for the members of the Five New York

Families to pay their respects.

First CUNEO, then STRACHI and then ZALUCHI.  Then PHILIP

TATTAGLIA, who merely passes by the Coffin.

Then BARZINI in a black homburg, standing a long time.

MICHAEL watches the scene.

BARZINI crosses himself and passes on, immediately rejoined

by his men.

As BARZINI leaves, it seems as though everyone is fawning on

him; perhaps asking for favors: But at any rate, it is clear

from the doors opened for him, the cigars lit for him, that

he is the new Capo di Capi--the place formerly held by Don

Corleone.

MICHAEL watches silently.

BARZINI is searching for somebody with his eyes.  First

CLEMENZA.  Then TESSIO.

CONNIE rushes into MICHAEL's arms, tears in her eyes.  He

embraces and comforts her.

Everywhere MICHAEL goes, NERI is a few feet away--watching

all who come close to him.

EXT DAY: MALL (LATER)

Later on the Mall; some people have left, although there are

still hundreds of mourners.

A young GIRL approaches TESSIO.  She's about 18.

TESSIO makes a gesture, which is to say 'How you've grown',

and they move though the crowd, looking for Michael.  He

finds him.

MIKE; nods; and they move to a private place.  NERI is close

by.

MICHAEL looks at him.

EXT DAY: CEMETERY (1955)

The Cemetery.  Late day.

The hundreds of cars, limousines and flower cars line the

stone wall that surrounds this Italian-Catholic cemetary in

Queens Village.

Hundreds of people stand in a cluster; others watch; take

pictures, etc.

MICHAEL stands with his family, his MOTHER...and TOM HAGEN.

HAGEN looks at him; understands.

They look up.

The coffin is lowered into an excavation, behind which

stands an enormous stone monument; it is of a weeping angel,

with the bold inscription: CORLEONE.

---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

FADE IN:

INT DAY: NERI'S APT. (1955)

ALBERT NERI moves around in his small Corona Apartment; he

pulls a small trunk from under his bed.  He opens it, and we

see in it, nearly folded, a New York City Policeman's

uniform.  He takes it out piece by piece, almost reverently.

Then the badge, and the identification card; with his

picture on it.  Slowly, in the solitude of his room, he

begins to dress.

INT DAY: MICHAEL'S BEDROOM (1955)

MICHAEL and KAY are getting dressed for the christening in

their room.  MICHAEL looks very well; very calm; KAY is

beginning to take on a matronly look.

INT DAY: MOTEL ROOM (1955)

In a Long Island motel.

ROCCO LAMPONE carefully disassembles a revolver; oils it,

checks it, and puts it back together.

EXT DAY: CLEMENZA'S HOUSE (1955)

PETER CLEMENZA about to get in his Lincoln.  He hesitates,

takes a rag and cleans some dirt off of the fender, and then

gets in, drives off.

EXT DAY: CHURCH (1955)

The Church.

Various relatives and friends are beginning to gather at the

Church.  They laugh and talk.  A MONSIGNOR is officiating.

Not all of the participants have arrived yet.

CONNIE is there, with a beaming CARLO.  She holds the

infant; showing him off to interested people.

EXT DAY: U.N. PLAZA (1955)

NERI walks down the sidewalk in the neighborhood of the UN

Building.  He is dressed as, and has the bearing of, a

policeman.  He carries a huge flashlight.

EXT DAY: MOTEL BALCONY (1955)

LAMPONE steps out onto the little balcony of a Sea-Resort

Motel; We can see the bright, neon lit sign advertising

"ROOMS FACING THE SEA--VACANY".

INT DAY: CHURCH

The Church.

CONNIE holds the baby; the MONSIGNOR is speaking; KAY and

MICHAEL stand side by side around the urn.

EXT DAY: FIFTH AVE.

NERI continues up the 55th St. and Fifth Avenue area.  He

continues until he is in front of Rockefeller Center.  On

his side of the street, he spots a limousine waiting directly

across from the main entrance of the building.  Slowly he

approaches the limo, and taps on its fender with his

nightstick.

The DRIVER looks up in surprise.

NERI points to the "No Parking" sign.

The DRIVER turns his head away.

The DRIVER takes a ten dollar bill, folds it deliberately,

and hands it out the window, trying to put it under NERI's

jacket.

NERI backs up, letting the bill fall onto the street.  Then

he crooks a finger at the DRIVER.

EXT DAY: MOTEL BALCONY

LAMPONE on the motel balcony spots a Cadillac pulling up.

It parks.  A young, pretty GIRL gets out.  Quickly, he

returns into the room.

INT DAY: HOTEL STAIRS (1955)

CLEMENZA is climbing the back stairs of a large hotel.  He

rounds the corner, puffs a little, and then continues upward.

INT DAY: CHURCH

The Church.  Close on the PRIEST's fingers as he gently

applies oil to the infant's ears and nostrils.

EXT DAY: ROCKEFELLER CENTER (1955)

The DRIVER of the limousine in front of Rockefeller Center

is arguing with NERI.

Now the DRIVER looks up.

WHAT HE SEES:

TWO MEN in topcoats exit the building, through the revolving

glass doors.

NERI opens up fire, trapping BARZINI in the shattering glass

doors.  The doors still rotate, moving the dead body of

BARZINI within them.

INT DAY: CHURCH

In the Church--the VIEW on MICHAEL.  The PRIEST hands him

the infant.

INT DAY: MOTEL MURDER (1955)

LAMPONE, backed up by two other MEN in his regime, runs down

the iron-rail steps, and kicks in the door on Room 7F.

PHILIP TATTAGLIA, old and wizened and naked, leaps up; a

semi-nude young GIRL leans up.

They are riddled with gunfire.

INT DAY: HOTEL STAIRS (1955)

CLEMENZA, huffing and puffing, climbs the back stairs, with

his package.

INT DAY: CHURCH

The PRIEST pours water over the forehead of the infant

MICHAEL holds.

INT DAY: HOTEL ELEVATOR MURDER (1955)

CLEMENZA, out of breath, climbs the final few steps.

He walks through some glass doors, and moves to an ornate

elevator waiting shaft.

The lights indicate the elevator has arrived.

The doors open, and we see a surprised CUNEO standing with

the dapper MOE GREENE.

CLEMENZA fires into the small elevator with a shotgun.

The PRIEST hands a lighted candle to MICHAEL.

Flash bulbs go off.  Everyone is smiles, and crowds around

MICHAEL, KAY, CONNIE...and CARLO.

--------------------------------------FADE OUT----------

EXT DAY: CHURCH (1955)

The christening party outside the Church.

Four or five limousines have been waiting; now pull up to

receive MAMA, CONNIE and the baby; and the others.

Everyone is very happy; only MICHAEL seems aloof and grave.

As the fuss is going on, a car pulls up.  LAMPONE gets out

and works his way to MICHAEL.  He whispers in his ear.  This

is the news MICHAEL has been waiting for.

CONNIE holds the baby up to MICHAEL.

The infant turns its head, and MICHAEL uses that as an

excuse to back away.

He kisses KAY.

People are guided to the correct limousines; they start to

drive off.

INT DAY: DON'S KITCHEN

TESSIO sits in the Kitchen of the Main House on the Mall.

HAGEN enters.

TESSIO nods; moves to the telephone and dials a number.

He hangs up and smiles.

EXT DAY: MALL (1955)

The TWO MEN walk out onto the Mall, toward a car.  On their

way they are stopped by TWO BODYGUARDS.

THREE MORE BODYGUARDS appear around him.

He flashes at the men surrounding him; for a moment he

panics, and then he accepts it.

TESSIO looks at the men, and then pauses.

HAGEN turns, and walks away from the group.  Then about

twenty paces away, he stops, and looks back.

TESSIO is led into a waiting car.

HAGEN looks away, and walks off.

INT DAY: CARLO'S LIVING ROOM (1955)

CARLO RIZZI is alone in his house, smoking, waiting rather

nervously.  He moves to the window and looks out.

WHAT HE SEES:

EXT DAY: MALL (1955)

MICHAEL, still dressed in a dark suit; followed by NERI,

LAMPONE and CLEMENZA, then HAGEN.

They move toward us.

Excitedly, CARLO moves to the front door; opens it.

He wears a broad smile.

The smile on CARLO's face slowly fades, then, in a foolish

attempt for safety, he slams the door in their faces and

backs into the living room.

INT DAY: CARLO'S LIVING ROOM (1955)

The door opens, and the grim party enters.

CARLO is silent; he wants to talk but is terrified.

CARLO moves to the door; opens it.  There is a car waiting;

with a group of MEN around it.

He looks back at MICHAEL, who reassures him.

EXT DAY: MALL

CARLO moves out to the Mall; the BUTTONMEN are putting his

things in the trunk.

ONE opens the front door for him.

SOMEONE is sitting in the rear seat, though we cannot see who.

CARLO gets into the car; out of nervousness, he looks back

to see the other man.

It is CLEMENZA, who nods cordially.

The motor starts, and as the car pulls away, CLEMENZA

suddenly throws the garrote around CARLO's neck.  He chokes

and leaps up like a fish on a line, kicking his feet.

The garrote is pulled tighter; CARLO's face turns color.

His thrashing feet kick right through the front windshield.

Then the body goes slack.

CLEMENZA makes a foul face, and opens the window as the car

drives off.

EXT DAY: CARLO'S STEPS (1955)

MICHAEL and his party.  They watch.

Then he turns and walks off, and they follow.

---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------

FADE IN:

INT NITE: MICHAEL'S LIMO EN ROUTE (1955)

MICHAEL sits alone in the back of his car; NERI is driving.

They do not speak for a long time; it is night--car lights

flash by.

NERI turns back.

EXT NITE: PIZZA STREET (1955)

MICHAEL's car pulls up in a quiet neighborhood, near an

Italian Pizzeria.  NERI opens the door.

INT NITE: PIZZA PLACE (1955)

He walks alone into the restaurant.  A MAN is tossing pizza

dough in the air.

A MAN comes out of the shadows, with a strong Italian accent.

He stops, frozen in fear.  It is FABRIZZIO.

VIEW ON MICHAEL.  Gunfire from under his coat.  FABRIZZIO is

cut down.  MICHAEL throws the gun down; turns and exits.

EXT DAY: MALL (1955)

HIGH ANGLE ON THE CORLEONE MALL

Several moving vans are parked in the Mall; one feels that

these are the final days; the families are moving out; signs

indicating that the property is for sale are evident.

A black limousine pulls up, and before it has even stopped,

the rear door flies open, and CONNIE attempts to run out,

restrained by MAMA.  She manages to break free and runs

across the Mall into Michael's house.

INT DAY: DON'S LIVING ROOM (1955)

Inside the Corleone house.  Big boxes have been packed;

furniture prepared for shipping.

She hurries into the living room, where she comes upon

MICHAEL and KAY.

But CONNIE avoids her, and moves directly to MICHAEL.  NERI

is watchful.

TWO of Michael's BODYGUARDS move closer, ready for orders

from him.  But he stands there, waiting for his sister to

finish.

She tries to spit into MICHAEL's face; but in her hysteria

she has no saliva.

The TWO BODYGUARDS immediately take her arms and move her,

gently but firmly.

KAY is shocked; never taking her look of amazement from

MICHAEL.  He feels her look.

But KAY won't let him avoid her eyes.

She looks directly into his eyes, he returns the look, so

directly that we know he will tell the truth.

KAY is relieved; she throws her arms around him, and hugs

him.  Then she kisses him.

INT DAY: DON'S KITCHEN (1955)

She moves back into the kitchen and begins to prepare the

drinks.  From her vantage point, as she smilingly makes the

drinks, she sees CLEMENZA, NERI and ROCCO LAMPONE enter the

house with their BODYGUARDS.

She watches with curiosity, as MICHAEL stands to receive

them.  He stands arrogantly at ease, weight resting on one

foot slightly behind the other.  One hand on his hip, like a

Roman Emperor.  The CAPOREGIMES stand before him.

CLEMENZA takes MICHAEL's hand, kissing it.

The smile fades from KAY's face, as she looks at what her

husband has become.

INT DAY: CHURCH (1955)

KAY wears a shawl over her hand.  She drops many coins in

the coin box, and lifts a burning taper, and one by one, in

a pattern known only to herself, lights thirty candles.
