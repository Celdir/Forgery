INT.  HOSPITAL NURSERY - NIGHT

BABIES in bassinets, isolettes, incubators.  BABIES sleeping,

BABIES blinking, BABIES cooing, BABIES chirping, BABIES

squalling.

It's the SQUALLING BABIES, the ones with pinched faces and tiny

bunched fists, that seem to interest the TWO ANONYMOUS MEN in

Military Uniforms.  (Their anonymity is assured by the angles

from which they are seen; they are hands, they are feet, they are

the backs of heads.)

A lone NURSE watches them grimly as they make their "selections,"

marking the cribs of the most active, noisy BABIES with X's.

EXT.  VAN/HOSPITAL - NIGHT

ANGLE ON VAN DOORS slamming shut on a dozen squalling BABIES in

tiered red cribs.

ANGLE ON THE VAN pulling away from the loading dock of the large

hospital as a date is SUPERED over the scene...

INT.  CAGE/BASEMENT ROOM - DAY OR NIGHT

Vicious teeth, savage snarls, tearing flesh as three fierce

fighting DOGS battle a single WOLVERINE in large steel cage.

The cage is in the middle of a gloomy windowless room surrounded

by twenty TWO-YEAR-OLDS seated on folding chairs and dressed in

identical gray overalls.  As the TWO-YEAR-OLDS watch the battle,

amazement on their innocent faces, a date appears SUPERED over

the scene...

WE DISCOVER in the shadows more ANONYMOUS MEN (and WOMEN), some

of them in Military Uniforms, observing the children.

INT.  A WINDOWLESS CEMENT ROOM - DAY OR NIGHT

It's creepy:  the same children two years older, milling about a

bare cement room, apparently unsupervised.  They ought to look

cute, but somehow these joyless FOUR-YEAR-OLDS look slightly

sinister, all of them wearing drab uniforms and military burr-cut

hair.  Again a date is SUPERED over the scene --

-- just as an AGGRESSIVE FOUR-YEAR-OLD approaches a PASSIVE FOUR

YEAR-OLD seated on the floor and kicks him.

It's a harmless child's kick.  But then, as the DATE DISAPPEARS,

he kicks the PASSIVE FOUR-YEAR-OLD again.  And again.

The servo-motor in a remote video camera mounted high on the wall

WHINES slightly as the camera pans to the record the action.

INT.  WINDOWLESS "CLASSROOM" - DAY OR NIGHT

Puzzles.  Fingers fit shapes into holes.  The puzzles aren't fun

puzzles; they're obviously tests of intelligence or dexterity or

both.  SIX-YEAR-OLDS now, the boys perform in a grim room under

fluorescent lights as more ANONYMOUS MEN and WOMEN in polished

shoes and sharply creased military slacks cruise the aisles,

observing.

As a date appears SUPERED over this scene...

WE NOTICE one of the SIX-YEAR-OLDS is becoming familiar to us.

TODD.  We NOTICE his intense eyes as he dexterously manipulates

a puzzle.

EXT.  FIELD - DAY

Behind a cyclone fence topped with curlicues of razor wire, the

boys, now TEN-YEAR-OLDS, are marching in formation under the

supervision of a (faceless) DRILL SERGEANT.  Again a date is

SUPERED over the scene...

INT.  GYMNASIUM - DAY

Fourteen-year-old TODD is doing bench presses in shorts while all

around him his FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD COMRADES work out with weights

in a very grim and spartan gym that resembles a sinister

concentration camp more than the yuppie spas of the 20th Century.

The date appears SUPERED over the scene...

EXT.  OBSTACLE COURSE/MONTAGE - DAY

The FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLDS, TODD among them, jump, roll, dive, crawl,

swim, and rappel through a brutal course featuring:

vertical wooden walls,

fast moving rapids,

tangles of barbed wire,

steep rock faces,

and finally a jungle of dangling chains with tiny circular

"platforms" about eight inches in diameter every ten feet.

FOURTEEN YEAR OLDS bloody each other with pugil sticks and padded

cudgels while they swing twenty feet above the ground.  One of

them is knocked off, plummets downward.  CRUNCH!

EXT.  SNOW COVERED LANDSCAPE - DAY

Long even strides, two inches of snow.  Breathing hard, the

SIXTEEN-YEAR-OLDS now lope through hills and woods in shorts and

T-shirts, their breath coming in steamy blasts as the date is

SUPERED over the scene...

This a brutal cross country run under a grim sky in bitter cold

weather, but the SIXTEEN-YEAR-OLDS are super-fit, their faces

hard and without expression, their eyes as cold as snake eyes.

Except for the STRAGGLER, a lone boy who's bringing up the rear,

obviously in trouble, gasping for air, struggling, struggling,

struggling to keep his feet...

ANGLE ON A HILL where ANONYMOUS OBSERVERS, all in military dress,

watch.

ANGLE ON THE STRAGGLER, unable to keep his feet, going down,

gasping.  With fearful eyes, he looks toward the hill where he

knows the OBSERVERS are.

ANGLE ON THE PACK, sixteen SIXTEEN-YEAR-OLDS not looking back,

even as a single SHOT rings out.  TODD doesn't even blink, just

keeps running.

EXT.  SHOOTING RANGE - DAY

Suddenly, out of nowhere, a scary mechanized pop-up target, a

MILITARY FIGURE, erupts from the long grass, weapon pointing.

Before the weapon can flash a laser bean, AUTOMATIC FIRE ravages

the target and it disappears back into the grass.  The boys,

EIGHTEEN-YEAR-OLDS now, are wearing combat gear and carrying

automatic weapons as they advance through a sloping field of tall

grass.

Different sophisticated TARGETS pop up urgently, sometimes close,

sometimes far, some MOVING rapidly on tracks.

The EIGHTEEN-YEAR-OLDS expertly mow down menacing MILITARY

FIGURES while holding their fire when ANIMAL TARGETS or UNARMED

CIVILIANS and CHILDREN appear.

The eighteen-year-old on point is RILEY, a muscular redhead.

TODD is right behind him as a date is SUPERED over the scene...

Suddenly multiple TARGETS appear, charging.

BUDDA BUDDA BUDDA!  First TARGET down!

RILEY, panning for the next target, holds fire, passes over two

MOTHERS HOLDING CHILDREN, pans for a nearby SOLDIER TARGET.  But

the SOLDIER TARGET zips behind the MOTHERS HOLDING CHILDREN,

taking cover, weapon pointed at RILEY.

For half a second RILEY hesitates!

BUDDA BUDDA BUDDA!  TODD blazes away, mercilessly blowing away

the MOTHERS HOLDING CHILDREN TARGET and the SOLDIER TARGET.

as the ROAR OF GUNS gives way to MUSIC...

INT.  PROCESSING ROOM - DAY

Skillful hands operate a tattoo pen, stenciling an insignia and

a number on the left side of RILEY'S face over the cheekbone.

His cheek says RILEY, L.B., his face reveals nothing as...

The next face is TODD.  The skillful hands with the tattoo pen go

to work on his face, marking, stenciling the skin as...

Then the tattoo artist's bands finish with TODD and move on to

the next MAN, leaving TODD staring straight ahead, his cheek

tattooed, his face like carved stone, his eyes as unfathomable as

the eyes of a statue as THE OPENING CREDITS CONCLUDE.

EXT.  JUNGLE - DAY

Machinegun fire, SOLDIERS in cammies moving through lush tropical

growth.

A mortar explodes, a SOLDIER is engulfed in shrapnel.  As the

smoke clears, the SOLDIER screams mindlessly like a siren.  This

is real war, not training.

A title and date appear on the screen, saying...

As the title fades, we glimpse TODD advancing at a crouch through

smoke and enemy fire, blazing away at the unseen enemy.  Sweaty

and smudged, his uniform torn and stained with blood, TODD

reveals nothing on his stone face.  But he's clearly

unintimidated by the death of his screaming comrade as we...

EXT.  PINE WOODS - DAY

Automatic weapons CHATTER as TODD struggles through thick snowy

woods, half-carrying a bloody comrade barely recognizable as

RILEY.  Bullets spatter bark and leaves as TODD and RILEY take

cover behind a fallen log.  A date and title appear, SUPERED over

the action...

RILEY is nearly unconscious.  TODD glances at his own wound, a

savage opening in his side.  He considers the torn flesh as

dispassionately as a man checking a flea bite.

Bullets whiz around the wounded man as we...

EXT.  DESERT, VILLAGE - DAY

Sunbaked landscape, a burning village, ENEMY CORPSES sprawled

here and there, burned or horribly mutilated by artillery fire.

SUPERED over the corpses, a date and title...

WE DISCOVER TODD, RILEY, and several OTHER SOLDIERS, exhausted,

parched, in torn and bloodied uniforms, sharing a single canteen

under the blazing sun.  War is hard work!

EXT.  LAUNCH PAD - DAY

A fury of flames, the THUNDER of ignition as huge rocket engines

lift a space vehicle off the launching pad and propel it skyward.

EXT.  OUTER SPACE

Profound SILENCE!  The space vehicle that the rocket propelled is

a weathered looking military spaceship gliding through the

blackness of outer space like a huge shark.  A date and title

appear SUPERED over the scene...

As the title fades away in the eerie silence, we...

EXT.  ANOTHER PLANET - NIGHT

A huge moon looms in the blackness above a barely visible

landscape...

SIX SOLDIERS stagger through the rough terrain in pressure suits

and plexi helmets, breathing from tanks.

Sudden automatic fire staggers the lead SOLDIER.  His helmet is

pierced, air and blood erupt from the hole in his face plate.

The SERGEANT, his futuristic "chevrons" on his helmet, signals

the men to take cover, starts to return fire.  As a flare

illuminates the battlefield, we RECOGNIZE the sergeant through

his visor.  It's TODD.

EXT.  EXTRATERRESTRIAL CITY - DAY

Bombed out!  Buildings turned to rubble, smoking ruins, rain.  An

extra-terrestrial city ravaged by war to such a degree that it

bears an uncanny resemblance to Dresden/Earth in 1945 after the

fire-bombing!  The architecture, even in ruins, recalls old

Europe, and the streets are narrow, as in before (or after)

automobiles.

Bursts of AUTOMATIC FIRE, occasional MORTAR BLASTS.  A spooky

battle between unseen SOLDIERS is taking place in seemingly

deserted streets and alleyways.  And SUPERED over the gloomy

scene...

CRACK!  CRACK!  CRACK!  Shots!

Suddenly a terrified MOTHER dashes along the street, a screaming

BABY in her arms, looking for shelter.

A CIVILIAN MAN pops out of a doorway, pulls her to safety.

REVEAL TODD, watching from the shell of a once proud building.

TODD'S POV of four ENEMY SOLDIERS running at a crouch among the

rubble.

ANGLE ON TODD watching them scurry into a cellar door.  TODD

turns and gives a hand signal.

ANGLE ON RILEY twenty yards away, hidden behind exposed

machinery, acknowledging the signal and, along with a THIRD

SOLDIER, advancing toward the cellar.

EXT.  CELLAR DOOR

TODD, RILEY, and the THIRD SOLDIER converge stealthily,

coordinating with hand signals.

TODD pulls the pin on a grenade, and RILEY and the THIRD SOLDIER

kick in the door.

TODD tosses the grenade in as RILEY fires a withering barrage of

automatic fire through the cellar door.

BAHWHOOM!  The grenade EXPLODES.

Then, RILEY, TODD and the THIRD SOLDIER charge in.

INT.  CELLAR

HEAVY FIRE as TODD, RILEY and the THIRD SOLDIER spray the room.

ANGLE ON TODD signaling cease fire.

Sudden silence.  Drifting smoke.  Then...GROANS.

Four ENEMY SOLDIERS are sprawled motionless, horribly

eviscerated.  A fifth ENEMY SOLDIER, horribly wounded, is

groaning.

ANGLE ON TODD surveying the scene, stone faced.

TODD'S POV of the enemy dead, and several CIVILIANS equally dead,

as well as the dead BODIES of several CHILDREN.

BANG!  RILEY shoots the groaning ENEMY SOLDIER.

Silence again.

CLOSE ON TODD, his stone face.  What does he see?  What does he

feel?  Anything?  A mystery!

INT.  BARRACKS - DAY

A spartan room, bare bunk-beds.  Rain POUNDS on a window that

looks out into a stormy sky over the godforsaken ruins of the

Third Dresden Moon.

TODD is sitting on a bunk, shirtless.  His new rank has been

tattooed on his right cheek; there's a scar under one eye and

another scar that distorts his lip slightly.  The names of

various battles have been neatly stenciled down his left arm, an

official record, not a decoration.  TODD is silent, staring into

space.  The room is full of SOLDIERS in T-shirts, fatigues,

sleepwear.  WORDS APPEAR SUPERED OVER THE SCENE...

The WORDS FADE AWAY, the silence continues, the rain BEATS on the

barracks, no one says a word, they just stare into space or watch

the rain beat on the windowpane.  They look like robots...used

robots, made individual only by their different scars.

EXT.  BARRACKS - DAY

Rain.  Low buildings, boarded windows, slogans painted on the war-

scarred walls, the makeshift barracks in one building, command

quarters in the next.

A lone figure, a MAN IN A PONCHO, hurries through the downpour,

passing the barracks, heading for the command quarters.

INT.  COMMAND QUARTERS

Entering, the MAN shakes rain off his poncho.  His name is

RUBRICK, he's thirty-five, a lieutenant.  He faces the two bored

OFFICERS lounging in the cluttered office where outdated

equipment is strung together by mazes of wire and the desktops

are heaped with printout sheets and styrofoam coffee cups.

The captain, CHURCH, has his feet on the desk.  He's fifty years

old, gray and fat and soft.  The other officer, SLOAN, also a

lieutenant, is a thirty-five year old woman, dark, moderately

attractive, but not particularly happy.

INT.  "STATION" - DAY

A NEW SOLDIER fills the frame, a perfect-looking man/boy of about

twenty built like a linebacker, powerful looking with sculpted

unscarred musculature.  He looks straight ahead, unblinking, and

so does the one next to him, and the next one.  Twenty of them

are standing in line in one corner of an enormous space that was

once a station of some sort.  They don't seem to respond to the

chill or to the occasional drops of rain from the skylights

leaking sixty feet above them.

Wearing dripping ponchos, CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK are looking

the robot-like monsters over like so much meat, while a bright-

eyed blond colonel about thirty, named MEKUM, stands proudly by,

glowing with satisfaction.

The vast interior is so large that in spite of clusters of

stacked crates, part of a dismantled spaceship, a rusty

earthmover, numerous large pieces of machinery, and a whole

arrangement of exercise gear, the place has huge open spaces and

a sense of emptiness to it.

SLOAN walks close to the line of NEW SOLDIERS and studies one,

her eyes drifting over their muscular bodies.  She breaks the

long silence.

RUBRICK and SLOAN exchange an eye-rolling private glance that

means they've heard a lot of Daddy's sayings.

RUBRICK and SLOAN exchange a startled glance, but MEKUM doesn't

seem fazed as we...

INT.  "STATION" - DAY - LATER

A WEAPON FIRING!  BUDDA!  BUDDA!  BUDDA!  The automatic weapon is

being fired by the veteran soldier RILEY.  He's blazing away at

an elaborate electronic target a hundred yards away in the huge

space.

TODD is watching with the other VETERAN SOLDIERS.  They're seated

on the floor, wearing drab fatigues, directly across from the

twenty NEW SOLDIERS.

As TODD glances at them, the NEW SOLDIERS look back unblinkingly.

(The VETERANS, in spite of their impassive expressions, look very

human compared to the NEW SOLDIERS.  Their battle scars mark them

as individuals in sharp contrast to the perfectly-muscled young

giants across from them.)

The firing stops, and RILEY, his weapon empty, leaps to his feet

and salutes RUBRICK, who's been watching the demonstration with

the rest of the officers.

As RILEY joins the VETERANS squatting motionlessly, RUBRICK

glances at the shredded electronic target, glances at his

stopwatch, then looks at Mekum.

MEKUM smirks, picks up the weapon, disassembles it rapidly.

RUBRICK, CHURCH and SLOAN exchange glances of disbelief as MEKUM

scatters the disassembled parts onto the concrete floor with a

loud clatter.

TODD watches, unblinking, as MEKUM looks to the NEW SOLDIERS.

A blond Nordic giant is suddenly on his feet among the NEW

SOLDIERS.  There is real dignity in his salute; he's like a pro.

OFFICERS look at each other again in disbelief.

MEKUM punches his watch as CAINE 607 gracefully begins to pick up

pieces of weapon, doing it rapidly, yet without apparent haste.

TODD is watching, revealing nothing.

CLACK!  KA SHACK!  CLICK!  CAINE 607 slaps the weapon together,

loading a magazine with a final KA SHUCK, then he dives to the

floor, firing a rapid burst at the electronic target which blinks

wildly...

OFFICERS watch, impressed.

CAINE 607 is firing from another position.

The target goes crazy.

CAINE 607 is rolling and firing at the same time.

The target goes wild.

MEKUM's watch clicks off 27 seconds...28...29...

The firing stops.

TODD stares impassively as CAINE 607 salutes.  Beside him, RILEY

watches also.

RUBRICK is looking at the electronic target, grudgingly

impressed.

INT.  WEIGHT AREA/"STATION" - DAY - A LITTLE LATER

A NEW SOLDIER cleans an awesome weight with what looks like ease

as RUBRICK, CHURCH, and SLOAN again exchange impressed glances

and MEKUM watches smugly.

They're still in the giant warehouse in the gym section among all

sorts of ominous exercise devices.  The NEW SOLDIERS and VETERANS

are gathered in separate groups at attention, their faces like

stone.

TODD is watching the big man handle the weight easily.

EXT.  RUINS - DAY

TODD is loping through sheets of rain.  The terrain around him

features ghostly shells of buildings, shards of a city nearly

invisible through the curtains of rain.

His feet slash through flooding gutters and trash filled streets

bordered by ruins as he runs smoothly, evenly, keeping a good

pace, his breath rasping rhythmically, his eyes revealing

nothing as we...

INT.  OFFICER QUARTERS - DAY

SLOAN accepts a cup of hot coffee from RUBRICK as she considers

the plastic "papers" MEKUM has spread on the cluttered desk.

Ponchos have been hung by the door.  MEKUM is pointing to various

numbers and paragraphs.

CHURCH has been staring out the window into the pouring rain.  He

turns to MEKUM and interrupts.

EXT.  TODD RUNNING/RUINS - DAY

Rain slashes his face as TODD runs, his eyes staring vacantly

into the blinding storm, his legs pumping evenly, his feet

chopping through the thick mud in a wasteland of shelled

apartment buildings where rat-like CREATURES scurry out of his

way as we...

INT.  "STATION" - DAY

Separated by fifteen yards, the two groups of SOLDIERS, the NEW

and the VETERAN, sit on the cold cement floor, staring vacantly

into space as they await orders.  Occasionally a VETERAN will rub

his chin, another will scratch his nose, but nobody says

anything, and when their eyes accidentally meet, they look away

deliberately, expressionless.  Nobody flinches when a big door

opens and pale light streams in.

MEKUM is standing there in a poncho.

MELTON, one of the husky new soldiers, climbs to his feet and

steps toward MEKUM, saluting.

MELTON's face shows no expression as MEKUM continues.

MELTON heads out into the rain running smoothly and easily as

we...

EXT.  TODD/RUINS - DAY

TODD's breath comes in even rasps as his feet splash over rough

terrain, splash splash splash, hard work but nothing in his

stone face indicates he's not equal to the task.  Splash splash

splash!

INT.  OFFICER QUARTERS - DAY

In the cluttered office, RUBRICK, CHURCH, and SLOAN look up from

a conversation as MEKUM enters dripping wet and takes off his

poncho, smiling smugly.

EXT.  TODD/RUINS - DAY

Running.  Splash splash splash!  TODD makes a turn, heading back,

his face like stone, as we...

INT.  OFFICERS QUARTERS - DAY

MEKUM is filling his coffee cup as he speaks.

EXT.  TODD/RUINS - DAY

Breathing steadily, raspily, TODD lopes through the rain.

Something makes him glance back over his shoulder.

Thirty yards back he sees a vague shape, obscured by rain.

TODD looks ahead again, his face revealing nothing, his legs

maintaining the same even pace, running, running, running.

Then he looks back again.

The vague shape is taking form, a GHOSTLY RUNNER getting closer.

TODD continues at the same even place.  He doesn't look back

again until he feels closeness.  Then he looks.

IT'S MELTON only a few yards behind him, running effortlessly,

keeping a steady pace that's faster than TODD's.  The bigger man

moves even with TODD without even looking at him, as though TODD

weren't there, and then he moves ahead like a big machine,

inexorable.

As TODD runs, eyes straight ahead, he can see MELTON becoming

ghostly, disappearing in the curtains of rain ahead as we...

INT.  "STATION" - DAY

The huge doors are open to the rain as SLOAN, CHURCH, RUBRICK,

and MEKUM watch for signs of TODD.  Still dripping vet, the

muscular MELTON is standing beside MEKUM, breathing heavily but

not desperately.

A shape appears in the rain a hundred yards off, moves closer,

takes the form of a runner running.  It's TODD, still moving at

the same pace, his face like stone.

TODD lopes into the big warehouse and, breathing hard but evenly,

comes to a halt in front of RUBRICK and salutes.

CHURCH has been thinking and now he speaks to MEKUM.

TODD salutes and lopes toward ten chains that dangle from the

rafters sixty feet above, grabs one, and starts up it, hand over

hand.

MEKUM watches TODD climb, then looks at CHURCH who is looking at

him expectantly.

MEKUM grins at CHURCH.

Then MEKUM looks back at TODD, not hurrying.

TODD is thirty feet up and climbing, passing the eight inch

circular "platforms" or footholds in the chain every ten feet.

MELTON takes a few easy strides, gracefully catches a chain mid-

stride, and smarts up, climbing easily and twice as fast as TODD.

CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK crane their necks as the two men

struggle upward toward the rafters.

Three quarters of the way up, MELTON comes even with TODD, then

passes him.

MEKUM, watching, smirks.

CHURCH is watching too, and he's still not satisfied.  His brow

is knit, something's bothering him.

ANGLE HIGH ABOVE, AMONG THE GIRDERS

Stonefaced, MELTON is resting an a "platform" on the chain, sixty

feet up, beneath the girders, swaying gently.

His stony gaze is on the next chain where TODD is arriving at a

"platform" on an adjacent chain...only three feet away.

Their eyes meet, TODD and MELTON alone together sixty feet up,

three feet apart.  Neither man blinks, neither man flinches,

neither man reveals anything at all...

LOW ANGLE, LOOKING UP

CHURCH considers the men high above, then to MEKUM.

A sudden silence.

SLOAN raises her eyebrows, gives RUBRICK a look.

Frowning thoughtfully, MEKUM looks up.

They all look at MEKUM.  Is this the chink in the armor?  The new

soldiers can't fight?

Now CHURCH, RUBRICK, and SLOAN are stunned.  They exchange a

glance.

RUBRICK shrugs, turns to the VETERANS still sitting stoically in

a group on the cement floor.

Two of the veterans, ROMERO and GOINES, leap immediately to their

feet and climb rapidly.

SLOAN, CHURCH, and RUBRICK exchange a look as MEKUM smirks

confidently.

ANGLE ON TODD AND MELTON ABOVE.  They're still facing each other

across the sixty foot drop.

MELTON glances down...without losing sight of TODD.

ROMERO and GOINES are coming up the chains fast, hand over hand.

They're within ten feet, their impassive faces look dangerous.

Nothing shows on MELTON's machine-face, but he starts a slight

motion in his chain so that he spins slowly.  That way, as the

veterans surround him, he keeps a continual eye an all three.

TODD, his face impassive, eyes MELTON vigilantly.

ANGLE ON RUBRICK BELOW

For a long moment, RUBRICK looks up at the three men dangling

around the new soldier, then he shouts loudly at them.

ANGLE ON TODD as SMASH!  TODD is hit hard in the face even as he

starts to swing.  WHAM!  MELTON hits him again and TODD loses his

grip on the chain, starts to fall, grabs at the chain, clutches,

slides...

ANGLE ON MELTON, CRUNCH!, hit as he swings at MELTON.  WHAM!

MELTON hits him again, hard.

GOINES swings against MELTON from behind, smashing at him with

his free hand and with both feet.

MELTON ignores the blows from behind as he grabs ROMERO by the

face with one hand, yanks the face close to his own, and squeezes

mercilessly.

ANGLE ON TODD, TWENTY FEET BELOW.  He's managed to get a foothold

on one of the mini-platforms.  His face horribly bloody, he looks

up at the action twenty feet above him and sees MELTON suddenly

hurl ROMERO downward.

ROMERO rockets down past TODD...

ANGLE ON THE FLOOR as SMASH!  ROMERO's body crunches against the

cement not far from RUBRICK, SLOAN, and CHURCH, splattering them

with blood.

Their eyes are wide with disbelief and horror as they look up

again...

ANGLE ON MELTON in the girders as he turns to face the man who's

been clubbing him from behind...GOINES!

GOINES swings his chain wide and MELTON, eyes merciless, deadly,

swings after him.

ANGLE ON TODD, bloody, struggling up the chain hand over hand.

His eyes follow MELTON above as the new soldier swings and

swings, trying to get a blow at GOINES.

Just then, GOINES lunges at MELTON, SMACK, SMASH, he hits him

hard, and WHAM!  MELTON hits him back...

ANGLE ON TODD who has climbed to a "platform" foothold on his

chain five feet above the swinging fighters.  TODD looks down

on MELTON's back as the big man swings close, watching, tensing,

then...

TODD dives off his chain and lands on MELTON's back, crooking one

arm around the new soldier's neck and pounding him with one free

hand and strangling him with the other arm.

MELTON gurgles while GOINES hits him in the face.

ANGLE ON MEKUM WATCHING BELOW.  For the first time a frown of

concern wrinkles his brow.

ANGLE ON MELTON AND TODD on chains just below the girders.

MELTON slams an elbow back into TODD's ribs hard and TODD gasps

for air, but...

GOINES uses the moment to slam a knee into MELTON's balls and...

MELTON gasps, then grabs GOINES by the neck with one hand, rips

him from the chain, and sends him plunging violently downward

even as...

TODD goes for face with his free hand.

SLAM!  MELTON smashes TODD in the ribs with an elbow.

TODD savagely gouges out one of MELTON's eyes.

ANGLE ON MEKUM, sixty feet below, enraged at the sight of

MELTON's injury.

ANGLE ON THE VETERANS watching the brutal fight with blank

impassive faces, RILEY among them.

ANGLE ON THE NEW SOLDIERS watching, robot-like.

ANGLE ON THE STRUGGLE OVERHEAD.  SMASH!  SMASH!  SMASH!  MELTON's

elbows drive back into TODD's ribs.  The breath knocked out of

him, TODD gasps for air, pain contorting his face.

MELTON manages to get TODD's forearm into his mouth and bites

furiously, drawing blood.

TODD grits his teeth in pain.

WHAM!  Another blow to the ribs from MELTON's elbow.

TODD is losing his grip.

RILEY watches below, his face a mask.

MELTON bites and elbows furiously.

TODD loses his grip and grabs at MELTON, rakes flesh as he begins

to fall and then...

Plunging downward, TODD grabs wildly at the chain and catches it

...but he keeps falling, the chain ripping flesh from his hand

for twenty feet until...

He can't hold on any longer!  TODD plunges the last thirty feet

to the floor, landing with a terrible crunch right on top of

ROMERO's broken body below.

Sudden silence!

ANGLE ON THE VETERANS watching impassively as TODD lies

motionless, sprawled on ROMERO's body.

ANGLE ON THE NEW SOLDIERS revealing no feelings.

ANGLE ON CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK looking stunned and shaken.

It's MEKUM who breaks the silence, SCREAMING furiously at the one-

eyed MELTON who's still sixty feet up...

CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK lift their stunned faces from TODD to

MEKUM who's continuing to rant at MELTON as MELTON comes down the

chain fast...

MELTON lets go of the chain and drops the last fifteen feet,

landing gracefully on his feet in front of MEKUM and salutes.

As MEKUM turns, including all the NEW SOLDIERS in his continuing

tirade, CHURCH, SLOAN, and RUBRICK confer in low voices.

Turning his back on SLOAN and RUBRICK, CHURCH approaches MEKUM

who's still raging, indicating MELTON to the blank-faced NEW

SOLDIERS.

CHURCH glances at TODD's corpse dumped over ROMERO's broken body,

tries to assuage him.

The NEW SOLDIERS sit impassively, the bleeding MELTON among them,

staring right at the VETERANS.

Not far away three dead bodies lie motionless as we...

INT.  FURNACES/FURNACE ROOM - NIGHT

A rage of flame!  The mouth of a huge furnace leers with yellow

fury, eight feet high.

Two men, BURNERS, in asbestos fire suits and helmets, appear,

laboriously dragging a tattered sofa leaking stuffing.  With

effort they shove it into the blazing furnace where it is quickly

consumed.  Slowly the BURNERS turn and trudge back for another

load as we REVEAL A REFUSE BIN, seven feet high, looming in the

shadows not far from the flickering light of the furnace.  It's

overflowing with junk, barely distinguishable in the gloom.

The BURNERS grab blindly and haul out the next object.

It's ROMERO's dead body.  They haul it out of the bin and let it

flop limply to the floor where ROMERO stares sightlessly at

nothing.

The BURNERS stare at the body, exchange a blank look through

their visors, shrug and start to drag the heavy carcass toward

the flames.

INT.  REFUSE BIN/FURNACE ROOM/CLOSE BY

In the near darkness, the faintest flickering light reveals two

tangled BODIES, motionless in the confusion of refuse.  But not

quite motionless!  A hand opens and closes!  A bloody hand!

Fingers twitch.

INT.  FURNACE ROOM

ROARING FLAMES as ROMERO's body is tossed unceremoniously into the

fire where the flames begin to consume it.

For half a second the BURNERS watch ROMERO melt into fire, then

they turn their backs and head back for another load.

INT.  REFUSE BIN/FURNACE ROOM

BURNERS' hands reach in and haul out another corpse, GOINES,

dragging the body right over TODD's body.

As GOINES' shoe drags over TODD's face, TODD's eyes flicker

stupidly.

Then GOINES' corpse is pulled over the edge of the bin.

TODD blinks, fighting for consciousness.  Where is he?  He moves

his head...

INT.  FURNACE ROOM

The BURNERS, silhouetted by flames, feed GOINES' body to the

furnace.

CLOSE ON THE FLAMES as GOINES' body is consumed by raging

flames.

ANGLE ON THE BURNERS trudging to the bin.  They reach in blindly

for whatever's next.  Tugging with effort, they struggle the

clumsy object over the rim, and let it fall to the floor.  It's a

mattress!

Communicating with a look, the FIRST BURNER drags the mattress

toward the fire while the SECOND BURNER reaches again into the

bin.

The SECOND BURNER frowns through the visor, struggles with

something, frowns, wrestles with it.

Finally, with great effort, he pulls out a big carton that

immediately spills old magazines on him.

Disgusted, he pulls the partially full carton across the refuse-

littered floor toward the furnaces.

ANGLE ON HIS FEET, as the SECOND BURNER struggles toward the

fire, stepping over a trail of blood which is hardly noticeable

in the flickering firelight.

He passes another big corrugated bin with a sign an it.  The sign

says NONFLAMMABLE WASTE DISPOSAL...and the trail of blood leads

to that bin!

EXT.  OUTER SPACE - "DAY"

Silence!  A vast darkness with only a few tiny lights in the

infinite depths.

A battered rusty spaceship glides slowly and silently into view.

This is a GARBAGE SHIP and it looks it.  Awkward and slow and

totally unglamorous, it moves through space like a great clumsy

church made of steel as we...

INT.  HOLD/GARBAGE SHIP - "DAY"

As the massive doors on the underside of the ship open, light

spills in and there is a huge ROAR as tons of debris, including

massive pieces of machinery, huge statues, old vehicles, and

numerous containers, spill out through the open bays and tumble

downward.  The one that says "Nonflammable Waste" on the side

careens against the bulkhead with a THUNDEROUS sound, then

hurtles downward.

EXT.  JUNK MOUNTAINS/LANDSCAPE

As debris from the ship tumbles down onto one of several huge

mountains of junk that loom 800 hundred feet above a windswept

terrain dimly lit by four pale suns, the bays close, and the

rusty GARBAGE SHIP glides away.

Still the cascade of machines and other bulky junk THUNDERS down

the steep slopes, shattering, breaking into parts, tumbling and

tumbling, settling here and there, while a SCREAMING WIND, very

powerful, picks off the lighter pieces and carries them off like

snow blowing off a mountain.

The familiar-looking container somersaults halfway down the slope

where it bursts open, spilling a confusion of junk.

Above the container, a huge drum smashes into a hunk of machinery

and splits, oozing an awful looking liquid that spills down onto

the contents of the container, sizzling and smoking on steel,

eating it like acid.

Not far from a smoking piece of steel, WE FIND TODD'S foot

protruding from the junk heap!  It's motionless!  Acid drips and

hisses.

ANGLE ON TODD, sprawled "inside" the mountain of junk, grimacing

in pain as acid hits his exposed foot.  Trapped in the debris,

battered and bloody and weak, he struggles to rise, fights the

heavy objects pinning him, fights to avoid the dripping acid.  As

the wind SCREAMS furiously, he continues to struggle against the

junk that pins him as we...

EXT.  "INSIDE" AND OUTSIDE THE MOUNTAIN - DAY - A LITTLE LATER

TODD's head, caked with blood, appears from the junk like a man

looking out of a cave.  Wind seizes at his hair furiously.

He looks up, sees four pale suns in the sky...just as a huge

steel lathe comes somersaulting down from above like a loose

boulder, and TODD has to duck hastily to avoid certain death.

As the heavy steel tumbles down the slope below him, wind plucks

a twelve-foot I-beam from the slope next to him and whips it off

in a frenzy.

Holding on for dear life, TODD looks down at the ground four

hundred feet below and sees a bleak wasteland strewn with junk

shifting and skittering in the wind.

He notices something and reacts.

Far down on the floor there is a strange pattern of lines...and

moving along one of the lines are four tiny FIGURES...they could

be humans...but maybe not!

For a moment TODD watches them.

Then he starts to climb downward through the labyrinth of junk

"inside" the mountain, and we...

EXT.  LOWER ON "JUNK MOUNTAIN" - DAY - MINUTES LATER

Far down the slope, perhaps forty feet from the foot of the

massive mountain, TODD's head pokes out of the confusion of junk

and he looks down at the FIGURES below.

Seen more closely, the FIGURES are more distinct, but no less

mysterious.  Heavy outer garments like huge parkas and hoods blur

their individual shapes as they inch across the landscape,

apparently clutching one of several crisscrossing wires that

stretch tautly for miles across the bleak terrain like "roads"

through the wind.

TODD watches as one of the FIGURES moves off the "road."  He's

trailing rope that attaches him to the others as he struggles

through the wind, walking almost on all fours like an ape.

TODD watches the FIGURE moving among bits of junk until he

locates something he wants, picks it up, and starts to struggle

back toward the others, dragging his burden after him.

TODD is watching what would seem to be some sort of scavenging

process by these strange unearthly FIGURES as we...

EXT.  FADING SUNS - DUSK - LATER

The four suns are changing color, dimming in the sky, as we...

EXT.  LANDSCAPE AND "JUNK MOUNTAIN" - DUSK

Tiny in the distance, the four FIGURES are moving together along

a cable, headed away from the junk mountain.

At ground level now, TODD is watching them, crouched behind a

massive transformer that teeters slightly in the wind in spite of

its great bulk.

Peeking around the sheltering transformer, he spots one of the

taut cables lashed to an enormous piece of junk near the foot of

"his" mountain.  The cable is twenty yards away in a "canyon" of

junk and he'll have to move across open space partially exposed

to the wind in order to get to it.

He starts out from behind the transformer...

WHOOOOOO!  Screaming wind lifts him and hurls him thirty feet,

his arms flailing.  He comes down even further from the cable,

struggling to keep on his feet.  Gritting his teeth, he fights

the wind, struggles toward the cable.

Suddenly a chunk of steel whips at him and he ducks just in time

as it whistles close to his head.

TODD drops to the ground and starts to crawl "under the wind,"

toward the taut cable, and we...

EXT.  "STEEL HENGE" - DUSK - LATER

Seen by TODD, the four tiny FIGURES are far ahead, disappearing

in the distance and the dusk.

Following them on a taut wire, TODD is passing through a barren

landscape punctuated by strange ruins, great shapes of steel

thrusting out of the ground and looming over and around him,

vaguely recognizable as the wreckage of a space vehicle that must

have crashed long ago.

The mountains of junk squat a mile behind him.  He's come a long

way, it's almost dark, he's weak.

He hangs onto the wire, walking with effort.

He can no longer see the creatures ahead of him on the wire.

He notices something thirty yards off the wire to the right.

Steel crosses.  Maybe a hundred of them.  A cemetery.

Just then, the wind catches TODD, yanks him, but he hangs onto

the wire, holding on desperately, as the wind pulls at him and

makes him flap like a pennant in the breeze.

Then the wind dies enough for him to get both hands on the wire

and get weakly to his feet.  For a moment he looks like he might

collapse, but he doesn't, and we...

EXT.  LANDSCAPE - NIGHT

At night the four suns glow darkly like night lights.

TODD is alone on the planet, punished by the savage wind,

struggling along the wire, shivering.

Every stop is an effort, but the eyes stare into the dark and

they reveal no emotion, not even when he suddenly tenses, seeing

something ahead.

In the distance a faint light glows.

TODD considers it as we...

EXT.  WINDOW/SKYLIGHT - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

The window is detached plexi from some kind of vehicle, embedded

in a low mound of "earth" like a skylight.  Whatever is making

the light comes from below in a sort of hut that slopes only

inches above the ground.

TODD is hanging onto the cable only ten yards from the strange

window.  He can see more of them glowing all around him, as well

as silhouetted pipes issuing smoke to the wind.

TODD drops to his belly to keep under the wind.  He crawls ten

yards to the window and pears through it.

TODD'S POV of a fantastic confusion of color and movement seen

through the thick scratched plexiglass window.  The wild blurs of

activity make no sense to him whatsoever, nor do the very FAINT

SQUEALS of sound barely audible over the deafening ROAR of the

wind.

(What he's seeing in the room below is a violent pillow fight

between eight BOYS and GIRLS ranging from four to ten years old.

Wearing cotton shifts dyed red, blue, or yellow they're smacking

each other violently with rag pillows and laughing happily in a

dormitory-style full of stacked bunks.)

ANGLE ON TODD, prone on the "roof," mystified.  He's never seen

anything like it.  His grease-covered face barely reveals his

puzzlement when he is suddenly distracted by a change in the

wind.

The ROARING WIND that has dominated the environment since he first

arrived has diminished to a strong breeze.

TODD tries sitting up.  The breeze doesn't overpower him.  He

looks around.

The meaningless SHRIEKS of the pillow fight, though still muffled

by heavy plexiglass, are LOUDER now, but TODD's attention is on

the other window/skylight that glows from this strange "roof" and

on the strange sound that's coming to him, borne on the breeze...

a MUSICAL sound.

Struggling weakly to his feet, TODD staggers toward the next

window.  The MUSIC is LOUDER as he approaches -- it's waltz music

played on an accordion.

TODD drops to his knees and peers through the next window.

TODD'S POV through the second "window," another mysterious

vision!  The color and movement are more subdued, but TODD is

just as puzzled.

What he's seeing indistinctly through the thick plexiglass is an

OVERHEAD VIEW of a man and a woman gliding across the floor,

moving as one, first this way, then that, in time to a WALTZ.  In

the corner, another person is making a strange movement that

seems to initiate the music...

ANGLE ON TODD, flat on the roof.  Now that the weak breeze has

given way to a deathly stillness, the mysterious (to him) MUSIC

is clearly audible as TODD peers through the plexiglass at the

warm scene below, as puzzled by the waltzing couple as by the

pillow fights.

Then he gets to his feet again and in the stillness makes his way

past a smoking chimney toward the next window.  Halfway there he

freezes...listening!

A strange haunting WHISTLING sound is coming from somewhere...

TODD looks around at the blackness beyond the roof windows.

There's nothing visible...

The mysterious sound is louder now, drowning out the music

ominously, drowning out everything, everything, everything.

Suddenly TODD understands, but he's too late...

ROOOOOOOOOOAAR!  It's the WIND, back with renewed fury, more

powerful than ever!

TODD is hurtled into the air, tossed head over heels by the wind,

struggling, clutching at empty air in vain, buffeted, slammed to

the ground, lifted again before he can flatten himself, tossed

violently, somersaulted helplessly...

EXT.  INSIDE A TRENCH

WHAM!  TODD is slammed face first to the ground.  For a long

moment he's motionless, untouched by the HOWLING WIND for reasons

that aren't clear.

Finally he rolls over weakly and looks up.

In the weak light he can just make out the steep earthen walls of

a narrow trench looming eight feet straight up, protecting him

from the wind howling overhead.

TODD tries to get up...but the fall has injured his leg and he

slumps to the floor of the three-foot-wide trench, too weak and

injured even to crawl.

Lying there, barely conscious, gasping for breath, he suddenly

sees something.

Shoes!  Less than a foot from his bloody face.

He manages to lift his head a little and look up.

Silhouetted by the light spilling from an open door in the trench

wall are four children...ELLEN, ten, WILL, six, TOMMY, five, and

JOHNNY, eight.

Barely conscious, TODD can just make out the astonishment on

their blurred shadowy faces as they look down at him in

amazement.  Then they go OUT OF FOCUS altogether as TODD slumps

unconscious and everything goes BLACK BLACK BLACK, and we...

INT.  MEETING ROOM - NIGHT

VOICES, CONFUSION.  About fifty people are jammed into the low-

ceilinged meeting room, all of them talking at once.  They are

PIONEERS, men and women of all ages and many races, a hardy,

weathered-looking group dressed in plain clothes of muted color.

Their faces seem to have been etched by the wind with deep lines,

the skin burnished, and even the younger ones have crow's feet

around the eyes from squinting.

As they chatter excitedly, asking each other what happened, who

found him, where, and so on, a sharp-faced fifty-ish woman,

HAWKINS, is standing behind a table in the front of the room,

calling for order.

Just as the hubbub finally dies down, a grizzled pioneer named

SLADE bellows loudly at her.

HAWKINS stares SLADE down, refusing to speak until she has real

silence.  When she finally speaks, her voice is calm and

controlled.

A sudden murmur dies away quickly under HAWKINS' hard stare.

A murmur goes through the crowded room, then a woman named ELISE

speaks over the hum of voices...

HAWKINS glances toward MACE, a muscular, bearded man, about

thirty.

A commotion in the back room causes MACE to break off as JIMMY

PIG, a clean-shaven burly-looking pioneer in his thirties, pushes

his way in, followed by four more PIONEERS.  All five of then are

wearing their huge hooded parkas, strange Eskimo-type wind

goggles, and carrying weapons.

An excited hubbub.  HAWKINS is trying to restore order when SLADE

shouts over the commotion.

HAWKINS ignores him as she speaks with firm authority.

The way she says it, you know she's used to getting her way, and,

in fact, PIONEERS are exchanging glances and nodding when SLADE

shouts again.

INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

TODD is on his back in a bed in a tiny earth-walled bedroom.  He

stares stupidly at the woman bending over him.  She is SANDRA, a

woman of twenty-five who is attractive, but not in a glamorous

way.  It's a very natural beauty worn with intelligence and

dignity.  She's wiping away blood and grease from TODD's face.

TODD's eyes flick around the room even as he lies motionless.

He sees a window high on one wall.

He sees old-fashioned magazine pictures and bits of patterned

material hung here and there for decoration.

Clothing hangs from pegs on the walls.

He doesn't see the look in SANDRA's eyes as she discovers the

savage scar on his forehead or the sergeant's tattoo on his

cheek.  Eyeing these telltale marks, SANDRA pours liquid into a

spoon and holds it to his lips.

TODD swallows weakly.

SANDRA smiles, stands up, moves toward the door.

TODD watches her exit.

He hears her VOICE in the next room...a low murmur.

He's looking around again when a NOISE makes him look back toward

the door.

A two-year-old is crawling into the room on hands and knees.  The

baby boy, NATHAN, stops just inside, seeing TODD in the bed.

NATHAN looks into TODD's eyes with childlike interest and wonder.

TODD meets the look with those blank soldier's eyes.

INT.  "LIVING ROOM"

A second tiny room next to the bedroom is the rest of the

Mace/Sandra/Nathan living quarters.  MACE and SANDRA are deep in

conversation.

MACE and SANDRA look into each other's eyes, very worried.

Then...

MACE is looking around.  He spots the open door to the bedroom,

hurries to it, and disappears.

SANDRA starts after him, looking worried...but before she gets to

the door, MACE reappears with NATHAN safely in his arms.

MACE and SANDRA lock eyes in firm understanding as we...

INT.  WAR SHIP - "DAY"

EXPLOSION!  SCREAMS!  SMOKE!  A SIREN!  We're in some kind of war

ship in outer space during a battle.

The interior is a lot like the interior of a submarine, cramped

even in the best conditions and right now the conditions are

awful as SOLDIERS in bulky space suits stumble through thick

smoke while a SIREN WHOOPS urgently and wounded SOLDIERS scream

in agony.

WHOOOOM!  Another EXPLOSION!  SCREAMING METAL!

Part of the bulkhead is shot away and the suction is like wind,

ripping SOLDIERS out of the hole into space..

We FOCUS ON a soldier in a space suit who's wedged himself behind

a cannon.  As we look closely at his visor, we recognize TODD

who's firing back at the enemy while all around him SOLDIERS are

screaming and dying as we...

INT.  BEDROOM - MORNING

SUDDEN SILENCE!  TODD blinks awake.  He looks around.

It's the same bedroom, but morning light is streaming in the high

window.

He can hear SOUNDS...LAUGHTER...coming from beyond the door.

INT.  OTHER ROOM

NATHAN is wobbling forward with wide eyes as MACE holds one of

his hands and SANDRA holds the other.  They're teaching the child

to walk, encouraging each step.  But when they let go, NATHAN

totters forward only one step before landing flat on his ass.

MACE and SANDRA laugh, making the whole thing a game, and NATHAN,

after a moment of confusion, joins in the laughter.  It's a warm

moment until SANDRA, sensing a presence, turns toward the

bedroom, suddenly serious.

MACE follows her look.

TODD is standing in the doorway, supporting himself on the door

frame...his soldier's eyes full of unspoken menace... one leg

heavily bandaged.

TODD says nothing.  His eyes flick to NATHAN.

MACE is watching TODD sharply.

TODD says nothing.  His eyes follow MACE who's gone to the corner

where he's seizing a heavy metal rod that might be a weapon.

TODD tenses.  Ready.  Dangerous.

As MACE turns toward him, MACE doesn't notice the danger in

TODD'S eyes.

He innocently approaches with the metal rod.

Super alert, TODD watches MACE hold the rod out to him.

TODD looks mistrustful.

MACE demonstrates, using the rod like a cane.

Expressionless, watches MACE use the cane.

MACE never even realizes how much danger he was in.

INT.  OTHER ROOM - DAY - A LITTLE LATER

TODD's heavy boots come close to NATHAN, the cane clumps down,

just missing him.

NATHAN looks up with open-mouthed innocence and childlike wonder

at TODD who looms past him, walking very cautiously with the help

of a cane.

TODD looks down at NATHAN.  Their eyes meet for a moment.  TODD

is wearing one of the heavy parkas the pioneers wear.

SANDRA answers a KNOCK at the door, opens it, revealing ELLEN,

the ten-year-old, in the doorway.  Behind her are JOHNNY and

WILL, as well as several other CHILDREN of various ages.

But ELLEN's eyes are on TODD and so are the others crowding

behind her to peep over her shoulder.  They all want to get a

look at TODD, but when he looks in their direction, they retreat

shyly.

SANDRA is wearing a parka too.  She picks up NATHAN from where

he's sitting near TODD's feet and carries him to the door, giving

him a kiss, then handing him to ELLEN.

NATHAN starts to cry and holds his arms out to his mother as

ELLEN hugs him and comforts him.

TODD watches the drama as ELLEN and SANDRA comfort the child and

soothe his fears at being separated from his mother.

Nothing shows in TODD's eyes...but affection seems to fascinate

him.

As ELLEN and her cohorts hurry off with NATHAN, they sneak over-

the-shoulder glances at the strange monster, TODD.

Just then MACE, dressed in a heavy parka also, comes out of the

bedroom and heads for the door.

MACE is heading out the door as we...

EXT.  INSIDE THE TRENCH - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER

Single-file, a dozen PIONEERS move along a trench as the wind

SCREAMS overhead.

We DISCOVER the cane and boots of TODD among them.  The MAN in

front of TODD glances back at him occasionally, curious, while

MACE and SANDRA walk behind him.

As they pass huts, there are windows high in one sloping wall of

the trench.  TODD doesn't notice the distorted faces of the

CHILDREN peering out at him, their noses pressed against the

plexiglass, full of curiosity as we...

EXT.  A JUNCTION OF TRENCHES - DAY

Three trenches meet.  Some of the PIONEERS move off to the left,

some to the right.  MACE is going left, but SANDRA guides TODD

toward the right with her.

MACE gives her a wave.  He waves at TODD too.  TODD looks

confused at the wave, then he salutes.

MACE is startled by that.  He sort of grins as we...

EXT.  GARDEN - DAY - LATER

A nasty little snake, a ten-inch VIPER, slithers through the dirt

among the neat rows of seedlings growing there until...

SQUASH!  One neat blow from the sharp edge of a trowel

decapitates the VIPER.

SANDRA flips the still wriggling thing aside and wipes her trowel

clean in the dirt as TODD watches with those blank snake eyes of

his.

They're on all fours in a garden.  The garden is simply a much

wider trench covered by a trellis so the light can be regulated.

There are already neat rows of vegetables are growing.  Behind

them, kneeling PIONEERS are planting new seedlings and weeding

around more mature plants.

SANDRA turns back to place a seedling in the dirt with only an

offhand glance at the dead VIPER.

Her meaning clear, SANDRA continues to demonstrate to TODD how to

plant the seedling in the earth.

TODD follows her look to the other side of the trench where the

plants are already eighteen inches high.

Other PIONEERS, working on their hands and knees also, are

sneaking glances as TODD, among them, a middle-aged woman named

JUDITH and an older woman, EMMA.

SANDRA frowns one of their looks away protectively as she selects

another seedling from a tray and hands it to TODD.

TODD looks at it.  He doesn't exactly look scared, but he handles

it gingerly, seemingly intimidated by the delicate seedling.  He

starts to plant it carefully as we...

INT.  DINING COMMONS - EVENING

Jabbering VOICES, the click of utensils.  Heaping plates of food

are being passed the length of long tables set up in communal

style.  JOHNNY is kicking ELLEN under the table, WILL flips a

piece of food at TOMMY when his mother, ILONA, isn't looking, and

the outspoken SLADE is lecturing a pioneer named CHESTER.

The conversation gets the attention of JOHNNY and WILL who stop

food-fighting to listen to the adults talk.

ANGLE ON ILONA noticing WILL and TOMMY listening.

ANGLE ON TOMMY and WILL glancing toward the next table.

ANGLE ON THE NEXT TABLE where TODD, wedged between SANDRA and

MACE, is eating like a machine, looking neither right nor left as

people jabber all around him.

ANGLE ON JUDITH whispering to EMMA at a nearby table as she

watches TODD eat.

ANGLE ON SLADE who turns now and boldly addresses TODD across the

gap between the tables...

There's a sudden hush in the noisy room, broken only by a few

urgent whispers and a cough.

TODD looks up from his food and meets SLADE'S look.

SANDRA scowls at SLADE as SLADE persists...

The silence is even more charged than before.

SANDRA looks alarmed.  Someone coughs.  The tension is

unbearable.

A sigh of relief from everybody!  But SLADE presses on.

ON TODD, actually struggling with the question...

remembering.  Suddenly he blurts...

TODD hesitates for half a second before answering.

There are looks exchanged among the PIONEERS as we...

EXT.  GARDEN - DAY

A little seedling is fitted into the earth gently.  TODD's strong

hands pat the earth around it.

TODD reaches for another seedling.  He's one of a group of ten

PIONEERS, all on their hands and knees, all working intently,

silently.  They seem to have accepted him.  Nobody stares.

TODD is carefully patting the next seedling in the ground when

something causes him to look up.

Five ENEMY SOLDIERS in torn and dirty uniforms are looming over

him, weapons pointed at him.  All around them is a desert of sand

stretching forever under a baking sun.

One of the soldiers kicks TODD.

ANGLE ON EMMA, JUDITH, and several other PIONEER WOMEN exchanging

nervous glances as they look back to where TODD's kneeling.

There are no soldiers...but somehow, he's trampled several rows

of seedlings.

TODD looks toward them, confused, disoriented by his "memory."

The women look away quickly, frightened, and we...

INT.  OTHER ROOM - NIGHT

SANDRA is changing NATHAN's diaper as she chatters, her back to

TODD.

Across the room, TODD, wearing a T-shirt and baggy pants is

sitting on a stool, his face impassive as ever.

As SANDRA talks, her back to him, TODD's eyes are on the contours

of her body against the shift she's wearing.  It's very...erotic.

TODD'S face is as impassive as ever while his eyes caress the

shape of her body...and she, unaware, continues to reminisce.

As SANDRA maneuvers NATHAN, TODD catches glimpses of her breasts

pushing against the material of the shift.  She continues, still

not noticing where his attention is.

A wry laugh.  She turns to put NATHAN down on the floor and

catches TODD's eyes just as he shifts them quickly from her

breasts.

For a moment it's awkward...she looks at him...then she recovers.

TODD doesn't answer as we...

INT.  CORRIDOR (AND MEETING ROOM) - DAY

The CHILDREN are peeking around a doorway, watching something in

the meeting room.

HAWKINS, coming along the dirt-walled corridor, spots the

CHILDREN ahead.

The CHILDREN barely acknowledge her as she comes even with them.

She looks at what they're looking at.

What they're seeing through the doorway is TODD, shirtless, doing

an eerie sequence of tai chi exercises.  His muscular body

ripples, revealing an incredible map of scar tissue that speaks

eloquently of the life he's led...gash marks, long zippers of

stitches, the puckered patches of burns.

HAWKINS watches for a long moment, her eyes worried.

In the midst of a slow graceful movement, TODD suddenly whirls

and delivers a lightning blow to an unseen enemy with amazing

speed and fury, the terrible force contained in the movement all

too obvious.

Even as HAWKINS and the CHILDREN gasp silently, TODD returns to

the graceful, almost balletic movement, even spookier now, that

preceded the deadly thrust.

The CHILDREN's eyes are like saucers, their jaws agape.

HAWKINS shudders...and breaks the hypnotic spell, speaking aloud

to the children.

EXT.  INSIDE TRENCH - NIGHT

It's dark, the wind's HOWLING just above the trench walls as TODD

peers into a faintly lighted window in the wall of the trench.

TODD'S POV THROUGH THE BEDROOM WINDOW reveals a tender moment

between MACE and SANDRA as they enter the bedroom and kiss.  A

flickering candle on a low table, the only light, exaggerates

their shadows.

ANGLE ON TODD, his face revealing no feelings as he turns away.

Light spills from other windows, some more brightly lit, as TODD

begins to jog along the trench, gradually picking up speed, until

he's running hard through intermittent pools of light in the maze

of dark trenches.

EXT.  BARREN WASTE - DAY

Stillness!  No wind!  Everything is quiet.  Bits of junk are

strewn across the landscape under the four suns.

EXT.  INSIDE A TRENCH

As MACE continues talking to TODD, he loads the pockets of his

heavy parka with miscellaneous hunks of metal.

MACE hands heavy hunks of metal to TODD who's wearing a parka

like MACE'S.  He pockets the metal obediently.

Behind them a small crowd of PIONEERS are doing the same:  JIMMY

PIG, SLADE, CHESTER, RED, a woman named SALLY and several OTHERS.

In addition to the parkas, they wear eskimo-style eye-protectors

and carry canteens, tools, and coils of rope attached to various

parts of their outfits.

ANGLE ON MACE noticing TODD eyeing the rifle JIMMY PIG is

carrying.

Other are already climbing the ladder out of the trench to the

surface above as MACE urges TODD to follow.

EXT.  "STEEL HENGE" - DAY

It's very still, no wind.  The little group of PIONEERS is moving

along a wire that passes close to the towering ruins of the

wrecked spaceship.  They are tiny figures in the vast landscape.

CLOSER ON TODD AND MACE as they plod along in the line of

PIONEERS.  MACE indicates the wreck off to the right.

TODD follows his look to a long open trench leading, apparently,

nowhere.

As they pass close along the trench,  TODD looks in and observes

the trench is knee deep in muddy water with rusty machine parts

and assorted junk protruding.

MACE chuckles at the sight.

A sudden SHOUT, "HEYYUP!  YO!" distracts them.

TODD looks forward, sees RED pointing to a chunk of steel a

hundred yards off the wire.

ANGLE ON JIMMY PIG, already fastening his safety rope and a

second rope to the wire, then heading off toward the piece of

steel, trailing the two ropes.

ANGLE ON MACE, explaining the procedure to TODD.

TODD is watching JIMMY PIG as he approaches the piece of steel

and starts to attach his rope to it.

TODD listens.

Nothing at first...then a very faint WHISTLING.  The sound he

heard that first night when he was on the settlement "roof."

TODD can see JIMMY PIG.  He's attached the rope to the steel and

he gives a signal.

As PIONEERS start to haul on the line, pulling the steel toward

them, MACE shouts at JIMMY PIG.

JIMMY waves, starts back toward them.

MACE indicates for TODD to help haul the steel and the two of

them are just joining in the effort when...

WHOOOOOOOOOO!  THE WIND IS SUDDEN AND FEROCIOUS!  IT STAGGERS

THEM!

TODD follows MACE'S example and, like the others, grabs the wire

and hangs on as the wind SCREAMS and tears at them.

One of the pioneers, CHESTER, shouts, points.

They all see JIMMY PIG being blown faster than he can run, his

legs churning desperately to keep up with his wind-propelled

body.  To no avail!  He's suddenly airborne, his legs still

churning like cartoon legs as he flaps helplessly at the end of

his safety tether like a kite, fifty feet in the air.

An eighty-pound steel barrel blows past, tumbling in the wind.

Bits of junk zip dangerously around like missiles.

ANGLE ON THE PIONEERS, crouched low on their knees against the

wind, clutching the wire with one hand while they pull on JIMMY

PIG'S safety line.  But the wind is too strong...until suddenly

TODD is pulling, and TODD'S strength makes the difference...

slowly JIMMY PIG is pulled toward them...and Pioneers exchange

amazed glances at TODD'S strength.

As he pulls, TODD notices what the others don't...

ANGLE ON THE RIFLE dropped by JIMMY PIG, ten yards away.

ANGLE ON JIMMY PIG as he's hauled safely in to the group of

PIONEERS who clap him on the back and hug him.  CHESTER is

laughing so hard he can barely stand up as he tries to describe

and mimic JIMMY'S desperate effort to outrun the force of the

wind...

CHESTER breaks off, suddenly sober, staring off, and the others

turn to see what he's looking at.  Everybody stops laughing.

ANGLE ON TODD, carefully moving away from the wire to retrieve

the rifle!!!  The WIND is dropping off some, enough to stand.

ANGLE ON MACE and the other PIONEERS reacting with alarm at the

sight of TODD picking up the rifle.

ANGLE ON TODD as he turns, rifle in hand.

TODD'S POV of the PIONEERS staring at him, the WIND diminishing

further.

ANGLE ON TODD looking toward them.  Nothing shows on his face.

ANGLE ON SLADE looking sour.  Trouble!  Just what he expected.

ANGLE ON MACE, taking a deep breath, smiling as he moves toward

TODD, holding out his free hand for the rifle...

But MACE breaks off, realizing that TODD'S attention is

elsewhere.

TODD is beyond MACE toward the landscape.

MACE (and the other PIONEERS) turn to see what TODD'S looking at.

ANGLE ON THE "JUNK MOUNTAINS" in the distance, several miles off,

where, hovering high above the junk mountains, an ancient DUMPER

SHIP issues a steady stream of metal and concrete debris onto the

junk heaps far below.  The faint THUNDER of the refuse tumbling

onto the steep slopes is just audible over the SOUND of the wind.

CLOSE ON TODD, as realizes how he got here.

ANGLE ON MACE, reacting to TODD'S intense interest.

As TODD turns and looks at MACE, MACE puts out his hand again for

the gun.

TODD seems to notice the weapon in his hand for the first time.

Unhesitatingly, he hands the rifle to MACE...

As MACE casually takes the weapon, the PIONEERS breathe a sigh of

relief, grinning again as the tension eases.

TODD has turned his gaze back to the DUMPER SHIP, fascinated.  So

that's what they did to him!

Just then, JIMMY PIG claps TODD heartily on the shoulder.

TODD, reacting to the smack on his shoulder, looks at JIMMY PIG

like what was that?  Are you hitting me?

But all the PIONEERS are gathering around TODD in such a jovial

manner that the puzzled soldier sort of understands this isn't an

attack.

INT.  OFFICE (OTHER WORLD) - NIGHT

A CHRISTMAS TREE!  The corny little tree with plastic needles,

blinking lights, and topped with a super cute angel is only a

foot high.  It's sitting on CHURCH's cluttered desk next to

framed photographs of CHURCH's wife and children.  We can hear

MEKUM's voice badly transmitted...

Glowering at the monitor where MEKUM's badly transmitted VIDEO

IMAGE is quivering and distorting, CHURCH waves the print-out map

he's holding in his hand, a map showing hundreds of little dots

against a vast field, stars and moons in the vast sea of space.

RUBRICK and SLOAN watch as CHURCH addresses MEKUM's image

indignantly.

CHURCH hesitates.  SLOAN and RUBRICK look at him.  Then CHURCH

blurts a question, his voice breaking...

MEKUM'S IMAGE disappears and the video screen goes blank, leaving

a glum silence broken only by the DRUMMING of the rain on the

roof.

CHURCH moodily strolls toward his desk, and his eyes go to the

photographs.

His wife and children smile back at him from the pictures.

Just then SLOAN taps him, and be turns to see her handing him a

cup full of amber liquid.

RUBRICK is pouring another glass from a bottle of Scotch as the

little tree winks on and off, and we...

INT.  BARRACKS - NIGHT

Silence.  Darkness.  Dim shapes in the darkness, hard to

distinguish.

Rain BEATS on the roof monotonously, relentlessly.

The room is alive with BREATHING.

Then we hear a MUFFLED WHOOP from outside.

The darkness is tense, the BREATHING changes rhythm.

The RATTLE of the door breaks the quiet.

The door swings open, a flashlight stabs the dark.

A woman GIGGLES:  SLOAN!

The flashlight beams and wavers in the darkness, catching brief

glimpses of the faces of the NEW SOLDIERS.  Their eyes glitter in

the lurching beam, their faces are ghostly like vampires.

RUBRICK switches on a dim overhead lamp as he and SLOAN (holding

the flashlight) and CHURCH stagger drunkenly into the bunkhouse,

carrying a couple of half-empty bottles.

Eyes riveted on the THREE OFFICERS, the NEW SOLDIERS are

unresponsive to Christmas cheer.  In fact, they look almost

angry, like big dangerous animals, as the three OFFICERS stagger

stupidly down the row of bunks, every eye following them.

CHURCH almost falls over as he places the tree on the floor

As stone faces watch him without expression, RUBRICK waves a

couple of bottles.

SLOAN, giggling, does a provocative bump and grind.

The NEW SOLDIERS don't react.  Stone faces.

RUBRICK sets three bottles down and indicates them to the NEW

SOLDIERS.

RUBRICK burps stupidly as the NEW SOLDIERS stare back at him from

their bunks, muscles bulging, eyes glittering, nothing but danger

in their stone faces as we...

INT.  PIONEER MEETING ROOM - NIGHT

"JINGLE BELLS, JINGLE BELLS, JINGLE ALL THE WAY."  In sharp

contrast to the gloom of the soldier Christmas, the PIONEERS,

MEN, WOMEN and CHILDREN, are SINGING and celebrating.

There's a six-foot carved wooden tree festooned with makeshift

decorations and ringed with heaps of presents in crude wrapping.

There's an appetizing looking buffet and a punchbowl.

ANGLE ON TODD seated against a wall not far from the door.  He

stares uncomprehendingly at the merriment all around him.  What

on earth is going on?  What are they doing?

JIMMY PIG is marching around in a Santa Claus costume, doling out

presents to ELLEN, WILL, TOMMY, JOHNNY and OTHER CHILDREN.

Passing TODD, JIMMY PIG acknowledges him with a wink and a

special "HO HO HO."

TODD'S eyes give away his confusion.  What the fuck is this?

JIMMY PIG in a fake beard and a fake stomach?  This is the

craziest shit TODD has ever encountered.

ANGLE ON NATHAN, a wrapped present in hand.  He hasn't a clue

what it is or what he should do with it.

Laughing, MACE and SANDRA hover over him, showing him how to pull

the wrapping off.  Great idea!  NATHAN likes pulling wrapping

off!  That's fun.  SANDRA and MACE watch joyfully as NATHAN tears

at the wrapping enthusiastically.

ANGLE ON TODD getting to his feet.

ANGLE ON NATHAN pulling away the last of the wrapping to expose a

pull toy, a METAL BIRD on crude wheels made of wire and junk.

MACE takes the toy, demonstrates pulling it.  The wings flap as

the wheels turn!

NATHAN reacts with delight and amazement!  Then grabs it!

A SUDDEN SCREECH...

ANGLE ON TODD looking alarmed.  He's on his way to the door, but

EMMA is charging at him, SHRIEKING!!!

Not sure whether this is an attack or not, TODD watches the older

woman scramble onto a stool next to him, still SHRIEKING giddily.

As TODD eyes her (and everybody else) warily, she gives him a

peck on the cheek and points over head.

TODD looks up, sees a strange cloth decoration with a sign on it

that says "MISTLETOE."

Means nothing to TODD.  There's a burst of applause as EMMA

scrambles off the stool.  Somebody starts to sing "GOD REST YE

MERRY GENTLEMEN."

A MONTAGE OF FACES:  JIMMY "SANTA" PIG, MACE, SANDRA, RED,

CHESTER, SALLY, ELLEN, HAWKINS, even SLADE, SINGING.

ANGLE ON THE DOOR.  No sign of TODD!  Gone!

EXT.  "ROOF" - NIGHT - MINUTES LATER

A low wind MOANS and mingles with strains of "OH, HOLY NIGHT" as

TODD bellies up to the "skylight" and peers down at the scene

below in the Meeting Room.

TODD'S POV THROUGH THE SKYLIGHT.  The merriment has evolved into

a more spiritual mood as the PIONEERS join in the solemn hymn.

But TODD spots NATHAN trying to pull his pull toy along so the

wings flap.  NATHAN is pretty wobbly and he goes down hard and

starts to cry.

Immediately SANDRA disengages from the adults and rushes to the

sobbing NATHAN and clutches him to her breast, soothing him...and

MACE joins her, hovering over his son.

ANGLE ON TODD, watching.  After a moment, TODD scrambles off the

roof and drops into the adjoining trench while "OH, HOLY NIGHT"

continues to blend with the soughing WIND.

EXT.  INSIDE THE TRENCH

Lit by spill from a window in the wall of the trench, TODD starts

doing push-ups.  One-two-three-four-five-six-fast-fast-fast-fast.

INT.  CORRIDOR AND MEETING ROOM/SETTLEMENT - (ANOTHER) DAY

HAWKINS is walking along the corridor outside the meeting room

when she hears strange SOUNDS.  She approaches the door and looks

in.

ELLEN and other CHILDREN (including NATHAN) are playing

children's games on the floor, paying no attention to the source

of the strange noises...JOHNNY and WILL.

JOHNNY and WILL are doing exercises, obviously inspired by TODD's

martial calisthenics, and including the sudden violent movements.

As the two boys make their ritual grunting noises, HAWKlNS frowns

a worried frown, and we...

EXT.  TRENCH GARDEN - DAY

The seedlings have grown to twelve-inch stalks.  SANDRA is

pulling some from the ground as TODD imitates her.  She shows him

the fat edible root.

Other PIONEERS are also harvesting, with occasional glances at

TODD as we...

INT.  OTHER ROOM - DAY

Cleaning vegetables, SANDRA is separating the roots, shaking the

dirt off, cutting away the excess.

TODD is carefully following her example, cutting the stalks away

with the knife.

NATHAN is tottering across the floor an a beginner's wobbly legs.

Whump!  NATHAN falls on his ass.

TODD watches SANDRA go to NATHAN and hug him affectionately.

Turning back to the vegetables, stone faced, TODD cuts his

finger.  Blood flows.  He ignores it, continues working...

But SANDRA, returning to the vegetables, notices TODD's cut

finger and immediately grabs a rag and takes his hand.

TODD looks startled is she takes his finger.  Then, staunching

the blood with the rag, she looks him in the eye, curious.

What's it like...?  TODD stares at her, trying to process the

question.  Seeing his difficulty SANDRA tries to help...

No answer, a stare.

TODD gulps.  His blank stare could pass for stupidity.

TODD wets his lips.  He seems about to answer...and yet it's

difficult for him.  He could kill a person easier.

On the floor NATHAN GOOS happily, oblivious.

A stunned silence.  Finally SANDRA speaks...

TODD looks at her.  This is incredibly difficult for him, like

physical labor.  He wets his lips and take a breath.

SANDRA is overwhelmed.  She reaches for him, hugs him to her

breast like a little baby, holding him.

But TODD is as tense in her arms as steel.  He can't relax.  He's

even trembling.

NATHAN, on the floor, looks up, smiles innocently.

SANDRA lets go of TODD and steps back, looking at him, her face

troubled, as we...

INT.  MEETING ROOM - DAY

ELLEN is supervising block building (babysitting) with several of

the younger children (OMAR, BUCKY, ANGIE and JANICE) while WILL

and TOMMY play their own separate games close by.  Then WILL

looks up and sees something disturbing.

He's speaking to JOHNNY who is doing martial exercises.

ELLEN looks up from the blocks.

WILL is smirking with satisfaction at having settled that when

out of nowhere ELLEN's little fist hits him hard on the nose.

WILL looks stunned.  Blood oozes from his nose.  He starts to

cry.

ELLEN looks horrified at what she's done as we...

INT.  OTHER ROOM - DAY

The scarf!  It's been knitted with an elaborate and colorful

design.

SANDRA is examining the knitted scarf as JIMMY PIG and his WIFE

stand in the doorway.

JIMMY PIG looks very embarrassed.  He shrugs.

JIMMY PIG nods, takes the knitted scarf back from SANDRA as we...

EXT.  ALLEY/CITY - NIGHT

Frantic CIVILIANS, mostly women and children, are illuminated by

FLASHES from rocket fire overhead as they scramble for cover

amidst heavy CROSSFIRE from automatic weapons.

A terrified LITTLE GIRL, separated from her family, seeks shelter

in a doorway when suddenly she's confronted by THREE SOLDIERS IN

RED UNIFORMS looming over her.

Looking up in abject horror, she sees a RED SOLDIER casually pan

his assault rifle, pointing the muzzle right at her from only a

foot away, unmistakably flexing to fire.

BLAM!  Suddenly the RED SOLDIER is blown backwards violently,

shot in the chest.

ANGLE ON TODD, visored, in a torn black uniform, firing again.

BLAM!  A SECOND RED SOLDIER goes down.

CLICK!  TODD's weapon jams.

As the LITTLE GIRL, amazed to be alive, watches open mouthed,

TODD swings his weapon like a club, attacking the THIRD RED

SOLDIER before he can aim.

Then she runs, leaving TODD savagely beating the THIRD RED

SOLDIER to death.

TODD is delivering a final savage blow to the prone body when a

movement or shadow catches the corner of his eye and he whirls

savagely to defend himself from behind --

INT.  MEETING ROOM - DAY

WHUMP!  JIMMY PIG is slammed up against the wall of the meeting

room, TODD's big hand around his neck.

Gurgling desperately, his eyes popping out of his head, JIMMY PIG

stares helplessly into TODD's merciless soldier eyes and his

stone face only inches away.

TODD blinks.  He sees he's got a terrified JIMMY PIG pinned to

the wall, his feet dangling two feet off the floor.  Slowly he

lowers JIMMY PIG to the floor.

All JIMMY PIG can do is squeak desperately and point to the

floor.

TODD looks down.  He sees a knit scarf lying on the floor.  He

doesn't understand.  He looks up.

He sees JIMMY PIG'S WIFE, HAWKINS, SLADE, and several other

PIONEERS standing in the doorway of the meeting room, their

stunned expressions indicating they just saw something

horrifying.

TODD stands there, isolated, bare-chested, his huge muscles

glistening with sweat, decorated with terrible scars and

mysterious tattoos, as we...

INT.  OTHER LIVING QUARTERS - NIGHT

EVA, Johnny's mother, is reacting, horrified.

CHESTER, Johnny's father, rushes in to see what the commotion's

about.

ANGLE ON JOHNNY in the tin cauldron that serves as a bath tub.

JOHNNY'S bare chest and shoulders are covered with crude

imitations of TODD's tattoos.

CHESTER and EVA exchange a look.

INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

MACE and SANDRA are lying awake in the bed in darkness.  For a

long moment they're both silent with the silence that comes in a

heavy moment in a conversation.  Then MACE speaks, his eyes on

the ceiling.

They're both silent for a long moment.  MACE has something

weighing on his mind that he hesitates to say...but finally he

says it.

A heavy silence, then...

MACE stares at the ceiling and speaks with difficult honesty.

Another pause before...

MACE is staring grimly at the ceiling as we...

INT.  WINDOWLESS CEMENT ROOM - DAY OR NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

Silent and surreal, the events of 1986 continue with the PASSIVE

FOUR-YEAR-OLD sitting on the floor while the AGGRESSIVE FOUR-YEAR-

OLD looks down at him, and other FOUR-YEAR-OLDS gather ominously.

It's only now, as he gets to his feet, suddenly trading vicious

blows with the AGGRESSIVE FOUR-YEAR-OLD that we realize that this

passive boy is FOUR-YEAR-OLD TODD.  The boys don't fight like

children; they don't quit or cry as the blood flows.

Highly-polished shoes, sharply creased trousers, and eyes

glittering from the shadows are all that is visible of the

faceless OBSERVERS who make no move to interrupt the violence.

FOUR-YEAR-OLD TODD, his nose pouring blood, exchanges savage

hurtful blows with his opponent, bloodying him viciously, as

we...

INT.  OTHER ROOM - DAY (PRESENT)

Eyes!  The adult TODD blinks away the memory, stares straight

ahead...

into NATHAN'S face, only six inches from his own.

They're all alone in the room.  It's very quiet.

NATHAN smiles a tentative smile, raises a hand, reaches out to

touch TODD'S face affectionately, curiously, testing their

friendship...

ANGLE ON TODD, his eyes.  Dangerous.  He draws his face back

enough to avoid being touched.

NATHAN looks unsure.  He's used to affection.  Then he

realizes... it must be a game!  He reaches out again...

Again TODD avoids the touch...and as he does so, something

catches his eye.

TODD sees a VIPER sliding across the floor toward NATHAN.

NATHAN doesn't see it; he's still trying to figure out this game.

TODD pulls off his boot and hands it to NATHAN.

NATHAN accepts it, thinks it's a gift.  He's pleased.  It's that

kind of game!  He gives TODD a friendly "thanks for the boot"

smile.

TODD points to the VIPER which is close to NATHAN now.

NATHAN looks at the VIPER.  He doesn't understand what he's

supposed to do.

TODD makes a hitting motion with his hand.

The VIPER is close to NATHAN, coiling.

NATHAN looks from the VIPER to TODD.

TODD indicates the VIPER with his eyes.  His look is intense, a

message in his eyes.

The VIPER is like a spring, it strikes...

TODD's hand is like a blur, almost invisible as he catches the

snake and flips it a couple of feet.

NATHAN stares.

The angry VIPER SPITS and HISSES and coils to strike again.

NATHAN looks at TODD.

TODD eyes the boot, then indicates the VIPER with his eyes.

NATHAN frowns; he's getting the idea.

The VIPER is about to strike again...

SQUASH!  A heavy boot comes down on the snake, crushing it.

TODD looks up to see MACE standing on the snake, reaching down

for NATHAN.  As MACE hugs the boy protectively to his chest, he

glares down at TODD with eyes blazing with fury.

TODD meets the look without blinking.  He never blinks.

TODD turns to see SANDRA standing in the bedroom door, her eyes

almost as hard as TODD's as we...

INT.  MEETING ROOM - NIGHT

TODD stares impassively as HAWKINS addresses him...

TODD is standing in front of the room full of grim-faced

PIONEERS, all looking at him.  It's like a court.

HAWKINS is flanked by MACE and SANDRA...

As she speaks, TODD's blank stare considers the weathered faces

of the PIONEERS facing him.  He sees CHESTER, EVA, RED with his

WIFE, JIMMY PIG and his WIFE, SLADE and MRS. SLADE, JUDITH, EMMA,

SALLY.  As HAWKINS continues, TODD's sharp eyes pick out details.

He sees JIMMY PIG opening and closing his hands nervously, he

sees SLADE fingering a barely noticeable rifle barrel.  CHESTER

has a weapon too.

The PIONEERS are nervous, ready for trouble, afraid TODD might

take this badly and fly off the handle.

As TODD's huge hand opens...and closes, their eyes are on it.  He

could pick up the table and hurl it at them, break men in half

with his bare hands.  His face is like stone, his eyes like

diamond chips as he glances toward SANDRA.

TODD sees SANDRA is moved, trying to suppress her emotions,

biting her lip, as HAWKINS goes on...

MACE doesn't finish.  TODD's eyes glance again at the PIONEERS.

They too seem moved, not so ready to shoot.

TODD blinks.  Once.  And we...

EXT.  INSIDE THE TRENCH - MORNING (WIND)

TODD is wrapped in a heavy parka, his mouth wrapped with the

scarf JIMMY PIG knit, his eyes covered with eye protectors as

MACE hands him another sack in addition to the one already over

his shoulder.

TODD glances at the knot of PIONEERS gathered in the trench, all

eyes on him.  SANDRA is among then with NATHAN in her arms.  For

just a second TODD's eyes go to the cheerful face of NATHAN; then

he turns to MACE.

MACE is startled to see TODD pull the scarf from his mouth to

speak.  He's never spoken before unless spoken to.

Then TODD replaces the scarf over his mouth and starts to climb

out of the trench into the wind as we...

EXT.  LANDSCAPE (AND "STEEL HENGE") - DAY - LATER

Four suns glare down from the sky onto the vast, windswept

wasteland.

TODD is a tiny dot in the vastness, traveling like a bug along

one of the long cables that stretches for miles and miles.  He's

out by the skeleton of the old ship as we...

EXT.  ANOTHER PLANET - DAY

A low slung armored vehicle on caterpillar treads RUMBLES over a

steep rocky terrain faintly backlit by a cold sun that looms

enormously on the horizon while giving off only a faint glow.

Hanging on to the outside of the insect-like scouting vehicle

(called a "CRAWLER") are two nasty-looking NEW SOLDIERS in space

suits designed for battle, their heavy rocket rifles cradled and

ready, their visors blank and ominous.

INT.  CRAWLER

The husky sergeant, CAINE 607, steers the vehicle and speaks into

a radio mike at the same time.

The GUNNER beside him and the NEW SOLDIERS in the back seat stare

stoically out the windows as CAINE 607 replaces the mike.

INT.  COCKPIT/"DADDY"

RUBRICK is sitting at a console cluttered with coffee cups and

half-finished cheeseburgers, responding to the radio.

RUBRICK turns to CHURCH who's standing in the cramped cockpit,

staring out a window at the gloomy planet outside, watching the

CRAWLER creep over the terrain.

INT.  CREW QUARTERS/"DADDY" - DAY

An oval hatch door swings open and SLOAN enters.

VETERANS in coveralls, slumped or sprawled on steel-tiered bunks,

scramble obediently to their feet, eyes on SLOAM.

As VETERANS start to pull space suits from under the bunks, SLOAN

turns her back on them...but hesitates before exiting as though

expecting something.  Sure enough, veteran RILEY speaks up.

SLOAN says it even before she's turned.  She knew who it would

be.

RILEY swallows hard and with effort keeps his hand from saluting

as he speaks.

SLOAN turns her back and exits.

As the door closes, RILEY, unable to restrain himself any longer,

salutes hastily as we...

INT./EXT.  COCKPIT - DAY - LATER

Through the cockpit window in the bluish glare of a work-light,

VETERANS, dressed in space suits, can be seem erecting a prefab

hut on the harsh moonscape.

SLOAN is watching them through the window while behind her

RUBRICK lounges with his feet on the console and reads a current

magazine on a VDT.  CHURCH is partially visible in the

background, poring over charts in the navigator's cubicle.  It's

very quiet until SLOAN speaks, almost to herself.

Silence.  SLOAN watches the VETERANS outside through the window.

They're working like a team of ants in space suits, erecting the

hut.

CHURCH gets up noisily from the navigation cubicle and joins

them, shaking his head.

INT.  PIPE - DAY

WIND!  As the wind RAGES outside, TODD, wearing his parka,

crouches over a tiny fire inside a huge open-ended pipe twelve

feet in diameter.  He stares at the bleak, windy landscape

outside his shelter.  He looks primitive, like a caveman, and

very very alone as we...

EXT.  PIPE - DUSK

The fat section of pipe is twenty feet long squatting in the

blowing litter on the grim landscape in the shadow of the junk

mountains.  Somehow that inanimate pipe also looks lonely in the

vastness as the four suns overhead darken toward evening.

EXT.  STARS - NIGHT

Stars glitter behind the dimmed suns as the wind HOWLS and we...

INT.  PIPE - DAY

The fire is nothing but coals.  TODD sits stoically over the

embers, more alone than ever, chewing on a piece of dried food,

part of his spartan meal.

As he chews, he stares blankly at nothing until...

A single tear crawls down one cheek.

Then another.

TODD looks like a stone statue oozing tears.  He reaches up and

touches the strange water with his finger, then studies the

finger, as though a tear were the most remarkable thing he's ever

seen.  He cannot remember anything like this; he cannot remember

ever having cried.

And suddenly, without warning, he's convulsed with tears, heaving

with sobs, alone in the big pipe with the pitiful little fire,

bawling like a baby as we...

INT.  BEDROOM - DAY

A VIPER writhes across the floor through the patterns of light

streaming through the window, a sinister presence, full of menace

and evil designs.

The VIPER winds its way toward an object that will prove in a

moment to be a corner of the bad.

SMACK!  The VIPER doesn't make it!  SMACK!  Another blow from

MACE's heavy boot being swung by hand.

The VIPER coils and HISSES angrily, wounded and dangerous.

SMACK!  The boot again!

NATHAN wields it awkwardly, hitting bravely at the HISSING VIPER!

SMACK!  NATHAN hits again and...

MACE rolls over in the bed.

SMACK!  MACE comes awake, looks around.

MACE lunges from the bed.

SMACK!  Just as NATHAN gives the damaged VIPER another blow, MACE

snatches the boy in his arms and yanks him away.

SANDRA sits up in bad, looking around, alarmed.

MACE is holding NATHAN, staring down at the VIPER.

The VIPER has up the ghost, lying on the floor.

MACE hugs NATHAN to him and looks toward SANDRA.  They both look

at the boot.  And at the dead VIPER.

Their eyes meet and, for a long moment, they just look at each

other.

INT.  OTHER ROOM - DAY - A LITTLE LATER

MACE is wearing his parka, pulling on his eye protectors

hurriedly as he opens the door to the corridor.  SANDRA's voice

makes him stop and turn to her.

Mace glares at her for a moment, knowing she's right.  Then he

turns away and starts out defiantly.

SANDRA looks relieved and worried at the same time and we...

EXT.  LANDSCAPE - DAY

This time MACE is the tiny figure struggling along the wire in

the wind, alone on the vast landscape under four suns.

EXT.  OUTER SPACE/"DADDY" - "DAY"

The military ship called "DADDY" (Defend And Attack Deployment

Entity) is a big ugly insect gliding through a black silent void.

On the grimy bulwark of the ship are the letters NAF followed by

serial numbers and the logo of the North American Forces.

INT.  COCKPIT - DAY

CLOSE ON space charts.  CHURCH's finger is indicating a tiny dot

on the chart surrounded by a vast sea of space.

SLOAN and RUBRICK are looking over CHURCH's shoulder while a NEW

SOLDIER sits stonefaced at the control console flying the ship.

RUBRICK shakes his head, snorts disgustedly.

EXT.  OUTER SPACE/"DADDY" - "DAY"

As the grimy skin of the ugly military ship looms across our

vision, a tiny orb is visible off the bow in the distance, a

remote world, destination of "DADDY" as we...

EXT.  CABLE/LANDSCAPE - DAY

Alone, MACE is pulling himself along the cable as the wind

buffets him.

Ahead the cable stretches past the skeleton of the ship and the

"catcher trenches" toward the mountains of junk towering over the

flat landscape several miles off.

A heavy barrel blows by, then an old refrigerator tumbles past.

MACE squints into the wind.

Off to the right about a quarter mile away he can see a big piece

of pipe...and a trail of smoke blowing out of the pipe and

disappearing in the wind.

MACE struggles the cable past flooded "catcher trenches" as

we...

EXT.  PIPE/LANDSCAPE - DAY - MINUTES LATER

The pipe lies fifty yards off the cable to the right.  As MACE

pulls even with it, he can see right inside.

TODD is standing just inside the mouth of the pipe, looking

straight out at MACE...but the light is behind him and MACE can't

see TODD's face as he SHOUTS at him.

MACE starts toward him, letting go of the wire, struggling in the

wind.

TODD watches him come.

MACE stumbles on, dances a few feet, recovers, struggles toward

TODD, SHOUTING....

Just then, a sharp gust staggers MACE, driving him several yards

toward a "catcher trench."

He's teetering on the lip of the flooded trench, about to fall

in, when TODD'S strong arms grab him.

They look like a strange four-footed beast as TODD drags him

through the wind in an awkward "embrace" toward the cable.

Once MACE has the cable in his hands, he laughs and gasps...

MACE breaks off.  Todd isn't listening; he's looking off toward

the horizon.

MACE follows his look.

Five miles away he can see an ugly insect-shaped spacecraft

descending from about ten thousand feet.

TODD doesn't answer.  He's staring at the descending ship with

soldier eyes and a stone face as we...

INT.  CORRIDORS/SETTLEMENT - DAY

Excitement, confusion.  PIONEERS and CHILDREN are clogging the

narrow, earthen corridors, shouting excitedly, hurrying outside.

SANDRA opens her door into the corridor, concerned...

SANDRA stands there stunned as excited PIONEERS mill past her,

jamming the corridor, and we...

EXT.  CABLE - DAY

TODD is on the cable with MACE, his eyes on the squat beetle-like

object crawling slowly toward then through the junk half a mile

away.

MACE raises his arm to wave.

Without taking his eyes off the approaching CRAWLER, TODD grabs

MACE's arm and pulls it down.

MACE looks at TODD, sees the grim expression on TODD's stone

face, and suddenly MACE is worried too.

INT.  CRAWLER

Peering through binoculars, a soldier in the front passenger

seat, the GUNNER, nudges the DRIVER and indicates something to

the right.

Two tiny FIGURES in the distance on a long cable.

The driver is the beady-eyed giant, CAINE 607.  Reacting to what

he see, he adjusts the vehicle to the right.

EXT.  CRAWLER/LANDSCAPE

Two ominous NEW SOLDIERS wearing plexi-goggles and bulky armor

under their uniforms hang on the outside of the CRAWLER in the

wind, their waists dangling with weapons and equipment, big

rocket rifles across their chests.  They're looking ahead toward

the long cable, as their nasty-looking vehicle grinds slowly

forward through the litter, an evil vision.

EXT.  LANDSCAPE

TODD and MACE are running, TODD in the lead, buffeted by wind,

struggling through a clutter of old machinery, diesel engines,

turbines, scattered haphazardly on the flat desert floor.

MACE is running too, not as well, and TODD has to reach back and

grab him, pull him along...

INT.  CRAWLER

The GUNNER works a servomotor, aiming a cannon, as he peers

through a scope.

Through the scope, surrounded by digital readouts, we see two

tiny running FIGURES...

EXT.  CRAWLER

BALAAM!  BALAAM!  The CRAWLER cannon FIRES...

EXT.  LANDSCAPE

MACE screams, he's hurled wildly mid-stride, tossed ten yards.

TODD looks back, sees him lying on the sand, screaming in pain.

TODD turns back, sprinting, low, weaving, tossed by the wind.

WHOOOM!  Another SHOT.  If the wind hadn't hit him, TODD would

have been hit.

MACE is screaming.  His right leg is gone.

TODD gets him, drags him, stumbles.

WHOOM!  Another SHOT, another miss.

TODD struggles for cover, staggering in the wind with MACE on his

back.

INT.  CRAWLER

Through his scope, the GUNNER sees TODD and MACE dive behind a

big turbine.

Unhurriedly the GUNNER flicks a switch on the dash.

CAINE 607 nods approval.

The GUNNER works the servo, bringing the cannon to bear on the

turbine.

EXT.  TURBINES

TODD is dragging MACE along behind the cover of the turbine,

glancing back for what he knows will occur.

BAWHOOM!  The area where they disappeared EXPLODES, chunks of

steel fly.

TODD keeps pulling MACE, who looks half dead as...

BAWHOOM!  The TURBINE is hit again!

INT.  CRAWLER

Through the scope, the GUNNER aims again and watches another

chunk of turbine disintegrate.

The GUNNER glances at the robot-faced driver.  Their eyes meet.

CAINE 607 nods.  Obviously, they've killed the two men.

The GUNNER points to the cable.

CAINE 607 follows the look, nods, and alters the course of the

vehicle in toward the cable as he reaches for the radio mike.

EXT.  ABANDONED ENGINES/TERRAIN

TODD is crouched over MACE inside an abandoned diesel engine not

far from the disintegrated turbine.  He's making a tourniquet to

stop the bleeding from the stump of MACE's leg.  MACE looks

awful, pale, in shock.  He speaks weakly.

TODD meets his look but doesn't answer.  He finishes the

tourniquet and turns his back on MACE to peer out through a gap

in the engine at the CRAWLER.

TODD sees the CRAWLER approach the cable, watches it veer left

and start to travel along the cable...straight toward the colony!

TODD turns and looks into MACE's face.  MACE's eyes are clouded

with horror.

No answer.

TODD shakes his head no.  MACE's eyes fill with new horror.

TODD turns away from MACE and peers through the machinery.

He can see the CRAWLER is a hundred yards away now, traveling

along the cable toward the colony.

He can see the faces of the NEW SOLDIERS hanging on the outside

of the CRAWLER, hard faces, goggled and ominous.

When TODD turns back to MACE, he finds MACE eyeing him with pure

hatred.  MACE sneers weakly.

His eyes roll back.  He's dead.

TODD peers out again at the NEW SOLDIERS.  They look invincible

as we..

EXT.  "DADDY"/LANDSCAPE - DAY

The spaceship is squatting on the barren ground a mile from the

junk towers like an ugly insect.

INT.  MESS/"DADDY"

RUBRICK sticks his head in the door of the cramped officers mess.

Both CHURCH and SLOAN look up in astonishment from the card game

they're playing on a tiny fold-out table.

CHURCH frowns, considers, then frets...

EXT. GARDEN TRENCH - DAY - A LITTLE LATER

HAWKINS, JIMMY PIG, RED, and other PIONEERS are peering over the

lip of the trench just beneath the trellis.

A half mile off they can see the CRAWLER creeping in their

general direction.

The garden is full of excited PIONEERS with their CHILDREN,

everybody trying not to trample the plants, but trampling them

anyway, as HAWKINS addresses them...

HAWKINS turns abruptly and looks over the rim.

The CRAWLER is closer now, only a quarter mile away, angling to

the left along the wire.

HAWKINS starts to climb out of the trench, boosted by JIMMY PIG

and CHESTER.  She's waving her arms, shouting.

SANDRA looks worried.

INT.  CRAWLER

CAINE 607 and the GUNNER both see the tiny figure waving at them

a quarter mile away, trying to get their attention.

As CAINE 607 adjusts their course to the left, the GUNNER's

servomotor WHINES as he aims, peering through the scope at the

helpless figure of HAWKINS.

EXT.  SETTLEMENT/LANDSCAPE

ANGLE ON HAWKINS suddenly reacting to the sight of the vicious-

looking CRAWLER coming straight toward her, now only five hundred

yards away.  They don't look too friendly!  Frightened, she's

lowering her arms and turning when...

BLAAAAM!  The cannon flashes, HAWKINS flies backwards!

EXT.  INSIDE GARDEN TRENCH

HAWKINS' body flies back onto the PIONEERS in the trench.  Panic

erupts as...

CHESTER raises his light rifle and starts FIRING over the lip of

the trench.

BAWHOOM!  The whole edge of the trench explodes, dirt flies, and

CHESTER is hurled backwards, dead.

PIONEERS are screaming and running wildly down the trenches...

JIMMY PIG bravely aims his rifle over the lip of the trench.

He sees the CRAWLER is lumbering right at him.

PING!  PING!  His shots are pitiful.  The CRAWLER keeps coming.

ANGLE ON JIMMY PIG.  No choice but to retreat.  He turns and

hurries down the trench after the others as we...

INT.  OFFICERS MESS/"DADDY"

CHURCH and SLOAN look up from their card game again as RUBRICK

sticks his head in the door to report the latest.

Again RUBRICK and SLOAN exchange a glance and an eye-roll at the

fretting old fuddy-duddy.  Then SLOAN changes the subject

brightly.

INT.  CREW QUARTERS/"DADDY" - MOMENTS LATER

RILEY is standing rigidly in front of his bunk in crew quarters,

flanked by the rest of the VETERANS in similar positions, facing

SLOAN.

EXT.  INSIDE THE TRENCHES - DAY

The NEW SOLDIER comes straight, like some inexorable death

machine, lumbering awkwardly with his burden of weapons, goggled

and blank faced.

A PIONEER is backing away ten yards in front of him, firing

wildly.  POW!  POW!  POW!

The NEW SOLDIER looks at one of his armor-gloved hands, opening

the palm in front of his face.  His hand's been hit.  He shakes

it, annoyed, like it was a bee sting, then he aims at the

PIONEER.

WHOOOOSH!  A tongue of fire from the NEW SOLDIER's flame thrower

engulfs the helpless PIONEER as we...

INT.  MEETING ROOM - DAY

PIONEERS are crouching in the room when the door bursts open, and

a tongue of flame turns the room into a firestorm and we...

INT.  CORRIDOR - DAY

SANDRA has NATHAN screaming in her arms as she calmly herds

frightened CHILDREN through a corridor, JOHNNY, WILL, and ELLEN

among them.

But if her demeanor doesn't reveal her fear, her eyes do.

EXT.  INSIDE ANOTHER TRENCH - DAY

Two Pioneers, SALLY and RED, lunge from a doorway into the trench

and fire a rifle and a pistol at a THIRD SOLDIER who's advancing

along the trench.

BANG!  BANG!  PING!  SPLAT!

SALLY and RED dive back in the doorway for cover where a pioneer

named SINGH is crouched, watching with alarm the THIRD SOLDIER

advancing unfazed.

ANGLE ON THE THIRD SOLDIER coming toward them.

ANGLE ON THE PIONEERS huddled in the doorway.

RED and SALLY watch SINGH step out directly in front of the

advancing THIRD SOLDIER and FIRE five shots rapidly...PING!

PIZG!  PING!  PING!  PING!

WHOOOOSH!  RED and SALLY see SINGH incinerated before their eyes.

Exchanging a horrified glance, they turn to retreat down the

interior corridor, but before they get two steps, they freeze...

A SOLDIER is in the corridor, not looking at them, but breaking

down a door.  They can't go that way!

Trapped, they turn to see the THIRD SOLDIER almost to the

doorway, his flame thrower aimed, his finger on the trigger,

and...

A blur!  Something lands on the THIRD SOLDIER from above the

trench, and the THIRD SOLDIER falls over backwards, slamming hard

to the floor of the trench.

But he's a super soldier, so that almost at the same time he hits

the ground he's already lunging upward to regain his feet and

fight except...

A knife blade rips across his throat, opening it wide in one

swift movement, and...

The THIRD SOLDIER's head sags back because not even superman can

fight with no neck and the last thing he sees through his plexi

goggles is...

TODD looming over him with a bloody knife, a face like stone, and

fierce soldier's eyes.

ANGLE ON THE DOORWAY, where RED, SALLY, and another PIONEER peer

around the corner, eyes wide with amazement at the sight of TODD

kneeling over his victim.

ANGLE ON TODD, slipping the utility belt off the dead THIRD

SOLDIER, yanking grenades and ammo from the bulky body, stuffing

a heavy pistol in his own waistband.

RED approaches timidly.

TODD glances up at him, and RED sees TODD'S eyes and RED backs

away quickly because...

TODD looks badder even than the new soldiers!

Turning back to the dead man, TODD goes for the last item...the

goggles.  Ripping them off he reveals...

A one-eyed soldier.  The dead man staring up at him is MELTON.

For just a moment TODD stares into the dead face, revealing

nothing of how he feels, as we...

INT.  OTHER ROOM - DAY

NATHAN is SCREAMING in terror on the floor, ignored as SANDRA and

CHILDREN haul the bed from the bedroom to add to the heap of

obstacles they've placed in front of the door already.  The

stove, everything is wedged against the door to the corridor.

As they heave the bed against the mountain of furniture and other

belongings, the door quivers, the heap of furniture shifts.

INT.  CORRIDOR

The FIRST SOLDIER, as big as an offensive tackle, shoulders the

door again, and it gives...

INT.  ROOM

CHILDREN SCREAM as the mountain of furniture heaves backwards,

and the door opens part way, revealing the FIRST SOLDIER.

SANDRA grabs NATHAN and hands him to one of the children.

SANDRA picks up a stool to defend herself.

INT.  BEDROOM

Dashing into the bedroom, the children are greeted with a

terrifying sight!  SMASH!  Soldier boots are kicking out the

little window high in the wall, SMASH, SMASH, SMASH, and the

window collapses, a boot sticks through the opening...

INT.  OTHER ROOM

Unhurriedly, the giant FIRST SOLDIER bulls through the furniture,

tossing the bed and table aside like sticks.

SANDRA smashes at him with the stool, hitting him twice, hurling

it in his face.

The FIRST SOLDIER shakes off the blow as if he'd been hit by a

feather.  But she's got his attention.  He turns his goggles at

her, starts to raise his weapon as...

SANDRA turns and disappears into the bedroom...

INT.  BEDROOM

As SANDRA dashes into the bedroom in blind retreat she runs smack

into the chest of another soldier!

Helpless and horrified, she looks right into a cruel stone face

and goggled eyes, and she gasps...

TODD never takes his eyes off the door as he brushes her roughly

aside with one hand, while his other arm aims the heavy rocket

gun right at the door and...

The FIRST SOLDIER comes into the doorway with his flame thrower

raised to torch women and children and what he sees is TODD

looking right at him, aiming the rocket gun, and BAWHOOM, the

FIRST SOLDIER is blown clear back across the other room with a

shot right in the chest.

ANGLE ON SANDRA, still on the floor where he knocked her,

watching TODD exit the room, weapon raised, his utility belt

dangling bandolier style across his chest.

He looks like...one of them!  A soldier!

INT.  OTHER ROOM

Crossing the next room, TODD moves quickly to the door, flattens,

and peers into the corridor.

He sees the SECOND SOLDIER heading toward him.

BLAM!  BLAM!  TODD fires twice around the door and sees...

The SECOND SOLDIER staggering back, hit, a pistol from his

hip...

Dirt explodes around the door frame as TODD ducks back.  Quick as

a wink, he yanks a grenade from his utility belt, triggers it,

and flips it around the corner as CRACK!  a shot rips at his arm.

BAWHOOM, the grenade goes off and, bleeding from his arm, TODD

swings into the corridor and follows the grenade with three quick

rocket shots.

INT.  CORRIDOR

Keeping low, TODD charges, his weapon pointed at the fallen

SECOND SOLDIER.

The SECOND SOLDIER is sprawled bloodily in the corridor, the

walkie-talkie on his chest squawking urgently.

TODD seizes the walkie-talkie, presses the transmit button, and

snarls a throaty animal growl into the mike...

INT.  CRAWLER/LANDSCAPE

CAINE 607 is sitting at the wheel of the motionless vehicle

parked near the trench garden, radio mike in hand, when he hears

the low ANIMAL SNARL come across his speaker.

CAINE 607's robot face reveals nothing as he listens to ANOTHER

GROWL.  WIND HOWLS outside.

Then he flicks a switch on the dash and puts the mike to his

mouth, his face expressionless.

PORTHOLE VIEW/EXT./INT.  OFFICERS' MESS/"DADDY"

Seen through the thick plexi-porthole, heavily-clothed VETERANS

are struggling with a wall, trying to erect the pre-fab unit

while the wind, inaudible inside the ship, rages around them,

staggering them this way and that.  What we hear in the quiet

interior of the mess is CHURCH voicing his disbelief.

RUBRICK, looking uneasy, is facing CHURCH who's looking up at him

from a game of solitaire at the little table.  SLOAN is biting

her fingernails in the b.g.

RUBRICK and SLOAN exchange a nervous glance as CHURCH paces

agitatedly.

EXT.  LANDSCAPE - DUSK

The four suns are dimming noticeably, dusk is falling.

The wind HOWLS, junk drifts and shifts.

A corpse turns over in the wind.  It's HAWKINS' BODY, ravaged by

the turbulent air, as we...

INT.  EARTHEN CORRIDOR/SETTLEMENT - NIGHT

Someone is dragging a CORPSE down the smoky, lamplit corridor as

little NATHAN watches SANDRA tending to the bloody wounds of a

PIONEER lying on the floor.  As the CORPSE is dragged past

NATHAN, the lifeless, vacant eyes stare right at the

uncomprehending little boy.

NATHAN sees the pioneer's seven year old daughter, ANGIE, sobbing

uncontrollably at the sight of her father's wounds.  SANDRA is

trying to help with the bandages and console ANGIE at the same

time while all round her in the hellish atmosphere people GROAN

and children CRY OUT.

NATHAN doesn't understand it, it's confusing.  MEN and WOMEN loom

past him.  He wobbles off down the corridor, toddling away from

the sounds of pain.

SHUK!  KA-SHUK!  Strange SOUNDS come from a doorway ahead, the

doorway to the meeting room.  CHAK!  KLAK!  SHIK CHIK KA CHIK!

The sound of metal and metal, metal parts CLICKING and SLIDING.

Alone in the corridor, NATHAN toddles innocently forward, toward

the SOUNDS.

INT.  MEETING ROOM

NATHAN wobbles into the meeting room doorway and stops there,

staring.

The burnt furniture has been heaped in one corner of the room,

leaving a large open space where TODD, bare-chested, a tourniquet

on one arm, is squatting on the floor, skillfully reassembling a

stripped rifle.

Surrounding him on the floor in neat piles are the rocket rifles,

pistols, ammo clips, utility belts, goggles, torn armor vests,

boots, grenades, knives, and flashlights he salvaged from the

dead soldiers.  TODD looks up at NATHAN and their eyes meet.

NATHAN recognizes his "friend," tries a tentative little smile.

But TODD just stares at him, and the unformed smile fades from

NATHAN's face.  For a long moment they just look each other in

the eyes very seriously.

SANDRA enters, her dress covered with the wounded man's blood.

Not noticing TODD, she rushes to NATHAN, grabs him...

Suddenly seeing TODD she breaks off, stares at him.

Squatting on the floor, surrounded by weapons, TODD'S eyes meet

hers for a long moment...then he looks away, goes back to

assembling the weapons with quick sure movements, almost as if he

wanted to avoid her eyes.

SANDRA wets her lips to speak, hesitates, then finally blurts out

what she can hardly bear to ask...

No answer.  TODD finishes with the weapon, starts checking the

next one.

TODD looks up at her and nods.  Their eyes lock.

TODD nods, turns back to his arsenal.

SANDRA stands there, hugging NATHAN to her chest, holding her

tears in, her lids quivering, fighting to conquer her emotion.

After a long, difficult moment, she wins the battle with herself.

She looks numb, stunned, but she's not crying.

TODD has begun to dress.  He straps a sheath knife to one ankle,

pulls on boots.  Then he pulls a jersey over his muscular torso,

covering all the old scars, the tattooed names of battles, and

the tourniquet on his arm.

Staring at him with glazed eyes, SANDRA notices a blotch of blood

form on the jersey, leaking through the tourniquet.  She speaks

numbly.

Stuffing his pockets with ammo and other items, TODD glances at

her with eyes that glitter dangerously.

SANDRA stares at him stupidly as he continues to dress, pulling

on a heavy armored vest.

TODD pulls on a second armored vast, one that already has a

ragged hole in it from a rocket.

SANDRA watches him go to the heap of charred furniture in the

corner and take a blackened stick from it, watches him smear

charcoal under his eyes.

TODD looks at her, a savage with blackened eyes.

For a moment SANDRA is silent, then...

TODD crosses two utility belts across his armored chest like

bandoliers.

His voice is soft as silk but hard as steel.  She looks into his

eyes.  Does she detect a hint of approval, of respect, in those

flat expressionless snake eyes?

TODD turns to go, laden with weapons, a flamethrower on his back,

a rocket rifle on his shoulder, another in one hand.

He looks back at her, right into her eyes this time.

INT.  CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

The NEW SOLDIERS are putting on their heavy gear in ominous

silence, covering their muscular torsos with armored vests and

utility belts while SLOAN watches from the hatchway.

They continue dressing obediently, their eyes the sullen eyes of

robots.  But CAINE 607 speaks up, at once respectful and

dignified...

Draped in battle gear the seventeen NEW SOLDIERS obediently

repeat the words after her, their eyes blank and sullen...  "Kill

kill kill..."  They look like somber death machines as we...

EXT.  "CONSTRUCTION" SITE - NIGHT

In the harsh blue glare of work-lights RILEY and the crew of

VETERANS, dressed in heavy parkas, are struggling in the wind to

erect the second side of a small hut.

RILEY sees something, reacts.

He sees seventeen NEW SOLDIERS exiting the ship in the fringe of

the work-lights, ominous death machines in their heavy gear and

goggles, partly lost in shadows like some vision from hell.

RILEY stares at them, at the men who carry the weapons he used to

carry, his face like stone, his eyes a mystery as we...

INT.  CORRIDOR - NIGHT

SALLY and RED are guarding a door to the trench when a CLANKING

noise in the corridor behind them makes them turn and look.

Their jaws go slack with amazement.

Clanking toward them is TODD, so armored and laden with fighting

gear he looks almost like a medieval knight!  He says nothing as

he looms closer to then, heading for the door.  The two of then

shrink hastily out of his way.

EXT.  INSIDE TRENCH

Stepping into the trench, TODD hears the wind SCREAM overhead.

He approaches crude steps dug in the side of the trench and

begins to pull himself up into the wind.

As he climbs, the SCREAMING wind changes pitch radically, and by

the time he bellies over the lip of the trench, the wind is only

a breeze.

Getting to his feet and finds even the breeze is dying, replaced

by a terrible stillness.

As TODD looks off into the darkness, a voice calls to him from

the trench behind biz.

TODD turns back, looking down into the trench, and sees SANDRA

looking up at him.

TODD looks at her for a long moment, his face a mask, before he

nods almost imperceptibly.  Her eyes are full of tears.

TODD looks into her eyes.  It is impossible to tell if he knows

that she cares about him and that she is blessing him.

After a moment he turns away and lumbers off into the darkness,

the CLANKING of his equipment the only sound in the spooky

stillness.

EXT.  JUNK/TERRAIN - NIGHT

Two CRAWLERS cut through the night fifty yards apart.  Four of

the NEW SOLDIERS cling to the outside of one CRAWLER, five on the

other, two on each CRAWLER operating spotlights that pan the

darkness to the sides while the headlights illuminate the

skeleton of the crashed ship and shadowy chunks of machinery

littered across the terrain ahead of them.

It is very still.  No wind.

INT.  CRAWLER ONE

A DRIVER is at the wheel, a GUNNER beside him, studying the night

through an infrared scope.  Behind them, two more NEW SOLDIERS

sit lost in shadows in the back seat, staring impassively out the

window at the spooky spotlights combing the eerie junkyard.

EXT.  CRAWLER ONE

The LEFT FRONT SOLDIER sits on the fender seat of CRAWLER ONE,

peering along the beam of his spotlight, scrutinizing the

sinister shapes in the darkness, when...

BLAM!  He's shot in the face, slammed back into the windshield of

CRAWLER ONE.

INT.  CRAWLER ONE

Vision blocked, the DRIVER is fighting for control of the vehicle

as the GUNNER to his right screams into the radio mike...

By veering sharply, the DRIVER is able to shake off the body that

was blocking his vision, clearing his shattered windshield.

EXT.  JUNK TERRAIN

Seven of the NEW SOLDIERS -- the three hanging on CRAWLER ONE and

the four from CRAWLER TWO -- drop off into the stillness.  One

checks the LEFT FRONT SOLDIER's body while the others, barely

visible in the weak light, fan out, keeping low, taking cover in

the random junk strewn all around them.

ANGLE ON NEW SOLDIER ONE, a corporal, crouched behind a huge

piece of discarded agriculture machinery.  He yanks a flare from

his waist band and fires it.

The FLARE bursts overhead, exposing the ghostly terrain to a

bright green light.

ANGLE ON THE JUNK AND THE SKELETON SHIP: a ghostly graveyard.  No

wind.  Nothing moves.  No sign of TODD.

INT.  CRAWLER ONE

Maneuvering across the junk-strewn landscape, the DRIVER peers

through the cracked windshield at the green terrain, looking for

TODD as the RADIO crackles...

THE GUNNER and the DRIVER exchange a glance.  The GUNNER takes

the mike and speaks into it.

INT.  CRAWLER TWO

CAINE 607 is at the wheel, speaking into his mike.

CAINE 607 accelerates the CRAWLER.

EXT.  JUNK TERRAIN

The flare fades and the near darkness returns.

ANGLE ON NEW SOLDIER ONE peering out into the stillness, then

signaling NEW SOLDIER TWO who's hiding nearby.

As the two NEW SOLDIERS step out from their sheltered positions,

they're joined by NEW SOLDIER THREE.  Exchanging hand signals,

the three of them advance, spreading out cautiously.

NEW SOLDIER THREE has moved about thirty yards away when suddenly

he "disappears."

EXT.  INSIDE A "CATCM TRENCH"

SPLASH!  SOLDIER THREE has tumbled into a flooded trench.

He struggles to his feet, can't figure out where he is.  He pulls

a flashlight from his waist and shines it down the trench in both

directions.

The flashlight beam reveals a steep-walled trench knee-deep in

water and littered with rusting junk.

NEW SOLDIER THREE splashes along the trench, looking for a way

out.

His light reveals a piece of a derrick mast leaning against the

trench, a perfect ladder.

He's slogging toward it when he whirls suddenly and splays his

beam down the trench behind him.

NEW SOLDIER THREE'S POV of the flooded trench.  Junk and water.

ANGLE ON NEW SOLDIER THREE, turning back and approaching the

ladder.  Just as he reaches the ladder he whirls again.

Again his light illuminates the spooky trench.  Again, nothing

but water and junk.

Relieved, he's just about to switch off his light when...

TODD rises out of the water only five feet away like a demon.

Before NEW SOLDIER THREE can cry out, TODO lunges at him.

EXT.  JUNK TERRAIN

As he creeps cautiously through the gloom, NEW SOLDIER ONE

stiffens.  Was that a stifled CRY?  Or not?

NEW SOLDIER ONE signals NEW SOLDIER TWO and the two of them turn

and move cautiously toward where NEW SOLDIER THREE was.

EXT.  INSIDE THE TRENCH

TODD'S light reveals NEW SOLDIER THREE slumped in the water, his

head askew, neck broken, eyes vacant.  TODD is hastily rummaging

through the soldier's equipment, looking for something.

He finds it.

EXT.  JUNK TERRAIN

NEW SOLDIERS ONE and TWO are approaching the trench when suddenly

a flare bursts above them.

The NEW SOLDIERS react with amazement as the flare exposes them

in a brightly illuminated landscape.  Before they can take

cover...

BUDDA BUDDA BUDDA.  Flashes of fire from the lip of the trench.

NEW SOLDIER ONE drops dead, NEW SOLDIER TWO is down and writhing

on the ground, SCREAMING.

ANGLE ON CRAWLER ONE veering sharply toward the trench,

accelerating, FIRING ROCKETS, CANONS, MACHINE GUNS....

ANGLE ON THE OTHER NEW SOLDIERS, prone, firing toward the trench.

EXT.  INSIDE THE TRENCH

Tracers whizzing over the top of the trench illuminate TODD as he

races down the trench, running for his life.

EXT.  JUNK TERRAIN

Still firing, CRAWLER ONE grinds up to the lip of the trench.

ANGLE ON NEW SOLDIERS charging toward the trench behind the

CRAWLER.

CLOSE ON CRAWLER ONE'S HOOD where a small trap opens and a nozzle

pops out like a little penis and...SQUIRTS a stream of liquid!

The liquid stream arcs fifty yards along the trench and

diminishes backward like a man pissing...

INT.  INSIDE THE TRENCH

TODD looks back just before be rounds a corner in the trench,

sees the liquid hitting the water in the trench.

Sheltered from their view by the turn in the trench, TODD tries

to scale the steep wall of the trench.

WHOOOOOOOOOSH!  The surface of the water-filled trench bursts

into flame.  A fiery river of flammable liquid.

ANGLE ON NEW SOLDIERS reacting to something!

NEW SOLDIERS' POV of TODD, visible in the firelight as he rolls

over the lip of the trench fifty yards from them.

ANGLE ON THE NEW SOLDIERS firing as they move toward TODD.

They've got him now!

ANGLE ON TODD bellying toward a rusting turbine, disappearing

from view.

ANGLE ON CRAWLER ONE, separated from TODD'S hideout by the

trench, pouring heavy FIRE on the spot where TODD disappeared.

ANGLE ON NEW SOLDIERS communicating by hand signals as they move

to surround TODD.

EXT.  BEHIND THE TURBINE

As rockets and canon shells SLAM into the turbine, TODD hastily

attends to a nasty wound in the flesh his thigh, bandaging it

skillfully, quickly.

EXT.  JUNK TERRAIN

While CRAWLER ONE keeps TODD pinned down, NEW SOLDIERS move to

outflank him.

EXT.  BEHIND THE TURBINE

As TODD completes dressing his thigh, the CRAWLER stops firing.

Silence.

TODD peers out, assessing the situation.

TODD'S POV of the terrain.  Vague glimpses of NEW SOLDIERS

slipping from cover to cover, never exposing themselves enough

for a shot.

ANGLE ON TODD.  He seems to know he's in a tight spot.  He's

preparing to fight off an attack, laying out weapons, grenades,

when...he freezes.  Listens.

Behind the stillness he can hear the faint WHISTLE that precedes

the wind.

Hastily TODD yanks his belt off.

EXT.  TERRAIN

NEW SOLDIER FOUR sticks his head up from behind an old boiler and

signals NEW SOLDIER FIVE.

ANGLE ON NEW SOLDIER FIVE acknowledging from the mouth of an old

storage tank where he's positioned.

ANGLE ON NEW SOLDIER SIX bellying toward TODD'S position.

EXT.  BEHIND THE TURBINE

Using his belt and a carabiner as a safety line, TODD attaches

himself to the heavy turbine...and gathers up his weapons.  He

can HEAR the very low WHISTLING building ever so slightly.

EXT.  TERRAIN

The WIND SIGHS and a faint breeze stirs.  Then a tin can skitters

by in a puff of wind as the NEW SOLDIERS take turns moving

closer to TODD, flanking him from safe vantage points.

NEW SOLDIER FOUR stands to wave the next man forward when...

WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOSH!  THE WIND ERUPTS, ROARS, BELLOWS...

NEW SOLDIER FOUR is lifted into the air and carried away.

NEW SOLDIER FIVE is trying to stay on his feet, as the wind SLAMS

him into one piece of junk after another.

INT./EXT.  CRAWLER

As the wind HOWLS and shakes the CRAWLER, the DRIVER and the

GUNNER stare with amazement as NEW SOLDIER FIVE slams into their

windshield, neck broken, and stares at them with lifeless eyes.

They see NEW SOLDIERS SIX and SEVEN tumble and somersault past.

As NEW SOLDIER SIX disappears, blown off into the night, NEW

SOLDIER SEVEN manages to grab hold of the walking wire.

Gripping the wire for his life, he turns just in time to be

decapitated by a piece of aluminum housing flying through the

air.

EXT.  TERRAIN

NEW SOLDIER FOUR, badly battered, is down on his belly trying to

stay "under the wind" when he sees something terrible!

HIS POV of a massive lathe blowing right toward him along the

ground, tumbling, crashing, slamming into things.  It looms over

him, unavoidable, the end!

ANGLE ON NEW SOLDIER FOUR reacting to the huge lathe about to

crush him.

EXT.  BEHIND THE TURBINE

Held by his safety belt and protected by the turbine, TODD peers

out, and watches the wind destroy the footsoldiers.

TODD'S POV OF NEW SOLDIER FIVE's lifeless body being blown along

the ground like a leaf.

ANGLE ON TODD, reacting.  He's seen something important.

TODD'S POV of CRAWLER ONE moving again, rounding the far end of

the trench and, no longer separated by the trench, turning

toward TODD'S position.

INT.  CRAWLER ONE

As the DRIVER steers, the GUNNER peers through his scope.

GUNNER'S INFRARED POV of TODD darting behind an overturned vat.

The DRIVER steers toward where TODD disappeared.

EXT.  JUNK TERRAIN

Windborne junk CLATTERS against CRAWLER ONE'S armor plating,

debris flies through the bright swaths of the headlights, as the

vehicle grinds toward the overturned vat.

ANGLE ON CRAWLER ONE coming around the vat, headlights glaring.

INT.  CRAWLER ONE

The GUNNER is peering intently through his scope.

GUNNER'S POV through his scope: The infrared view with crosshairs

is especially spooky because of the debris blowing eerily across

the landscape as the gun whips back and forth, looking vainly for

TODD.  Suddenly the sight is yanked hard, sweeping violently

over to pin a moving object...

False alarm!  Just another piece of blowing junk.  No sign of

TODD.

EXT.  CRAWLER/JUNK TERRAIN

The CRAWLER grinds slowly past a huge overturned boiler, its

cannon panning right, then left, then right.

INT.  CRAWLER ONE

Peering through the scope as he sweeps the terrain, the GUNNER

suddenly stiffens and back-pans to find something...

The DRIVER angles right, aiming for one o'clock.

The DRIVER swings the wheel back and they continue slowly through

the darkness.

In the back seat, two NEW SOLDIERS peer into the night with blank

faces.  One of them is watching a huge plastic sign cartwheel

past in the wind when --

-- he reacts!

-- as TODD'S face appears is only inches from his, right against

the plexi!

BAM!  Before the NEW SOLDIER can do more than look startled, TODD

shoots out the window with a pistol and shoves a live grenade

through the hole.

BAWHOOOM!  The grenade EXPLODES and...

The DRIVER fights for control of the wheel.

The GUNNER screams and screams and screams like a machine running

at high speed while the two NEW SOLDIERS lie open-eyed with death

in the back seat.

EXT.  CRAWLER

No sign of TODD.  Disappeared again.

As the wind ROARS furiously, the damaged CRAWLER limps along.

INT.  CRAWLER ONE

The dying GUNNER is making awful noises while the DRIVER, eyes

glazed, his face streaming with blood, maneuvers the vehicle

slowly and cautiously, looking for the enemy...

But all he sees through the cracked windshield is a shadowy world

of wind-tossed debris.

EXT.  JUNK TERRAIN

Protected by a hunk of pipe, TODD crouches and watches the

CRAWLER, his eyes glittering, his weapon ready.  It's clear now

that the tables are turned and he is the hunter as we...

INT.  CORRIDORS - NIGHT

EXPLOSIONS!  SCREAMS!  BAWHOOM!  Another shell hits, beams

splinter, dirt walls collapse.

Eight-year old JOHNNY, alone and terrified, comes in to view

around a corner.  He's been separated from the others.

No answer.

JOHNNY doesn't know which way to go.  The world's falling apart!

WHUMP!  The little warren of earthen corridors is shaken by

another BLAST.

Desperate, JOHNNY makes a left, away from the last blast and

hurries down a collapsing corridor past doorways that reveal

rooms with no ceilings where the wind HOWLS.  It's obvious the

shelling has been going on for a while.

Just then, JIMMY PIG pops out of a doorway in front of him and

and rushes toward him.

BA-WHOOM!  Another shell collapses the corridor behind JOHNNY as

JIMMY PIG grabs him and hauls him toward the door he emerged

from, the Dining Commons.

INT.  DINING COMMONS

EMMA is ushering CHILDREN through a trap door in the floor into

the root cellar as JIMMY PIG ushers JOHNNY into the room.

JOHNNY looks around urgently.

SANDRA is bandaging TOMMY'S arm while ELLEN, NATHAN, and WILL are

huddling under a table in the most protected corner of the room.

JIMMY PIG and JUDITH exchange a pained look as JIMMY PIG pushes

JOHNNY toward SANDRA and the table.

BAH-DOOOM!  Another fierce CONCUSSION twenty yards away shakes

dirt from the ceiling.  ELLEN beckons from under the table...

EXT.  SETTLEMENT - NIGHT

MUZZLE FLASH!  FFFWHOOOMP!  CRAWLER TWO fires another round.

The vehicle is squatting not thirty yards from the trench garden,

pouring round after round into the colony, lighting the night

with bright-colored flowery blasts.

Crouched in the wind not far from the vehicle, the two NEW

SOLDIERS from the back seat have set up a mortar, and they too

are firing away.

INT.  CRAWLER TWO/STATlONARY

The GUNNER is looking through his scope, methodically aiming and

firing as CAINE 607 at the wheel watches impassively.

KA-FOOMP!  Another shot, the vehicle rocks, and, five hundred

yards away, fire and dirt fountain thirty feet into the air.

BEEP!  BEEP!  A light on the dash blinks on.  CAINE 607 switches

on a radarscope, spots a blip.

The GUNNER takes his eyes off the scope, looks at the blip.

CAINE 607 is already manipulating a spotlight, looking across the

GUNNER out the right window.

The spotlight stabs the darkness, finds a moving vehicle a half

mile of moving toward them.  It's CRAWLER ONE with its lights

out.

As CAINE 607 flicks off the spotlight, the GUNNER turns back to

the scope and resumes his deadly barrage.  CAINE 607 speaks into

the radio mike.

FOOOMP!  The GUNNER fires again, rocking the vehicle.

CAINE 607 looks at the SCOPE.

The blip continues on directly on its course.

CAINE 607 picks up the mike again.

FOOOMP!  The GUNNER fires again as CAINE 607 looks at the screen.

The blip on the screen keeps on straight, doesn't alter course!

But the blip continues straight, directly at them.

And suddenly CAINE realizes!  Dropping the mike he snaps at his

GUNNER urgently.

As the startled GUNNER starts to obey both of them are bathed in

sudden, blinding white light as CRAWLER ONE suddenly switches on

all lights and...

KA-BLAM!  KA-BLAM!  MUZZLES FLASHES from CRAWLER ONE.

WHUMP!  WHUMP!  CRAWLER TWO shudders, taking two direct hits.

The GUNNER SCREAMS in pain.

INT.  CRAWLER ONE

TODD is at the wheel, speaking into the radio as wind whips at

him through the shattered windshield.

BLAM!  BLAM!  TODD fires as he drives straight ahead toward

CRAWLER TWO and the two NEW SOLDIERS pinned in his headlight.

EXT.  CRAWLER TWO

As shells slam into CRAWLER TWO, the two NEW SOLDIERS outside try

to get clear of the explosions, staggering off into the wind.

INT.  CRAWLER ONE

TODD sets his sights on one of the NEW SOLDIERS, cutting him down

with rocket fire, then he glances toward the SECOND NEW SOLDIER

on the right.

The SECOND NEW SOLDIER, ten yards ahead, stops, turns to fire.

TODD yanks the wheel, swerving toward him.

EXT.  CRAWLERS

CRAWLER ONE plows into the NEW SOLDIER, crushing him under the

wheels, and continuing to grind toward the crippled CRAWLER TWO.

WHAM!  CRAWLER ONE rams CRAWLER TWO and drives it sideways,

pushing it ten yards... twenty yards.... thirty yards...until

suddenly it sprawls into the mouth of the trench garden,

splintering the trellis and wedging itself at a sharply canted

angle over the garden, and we...

INT.  CAPTAIN'S CABIN/"DADDY" - NIGHT

Silence.  CHURCH is dozing fully clothed on his bunk in a tiny

stateroom.

BZZZZT.  BZZZZT!  A buzzer sounds and a light flashes.

CHURCH opens his eyes, sees the light flashing.

Siting up in the bunk, he grabs the receiver of a phone and puts

it to his ear.  As he listens, his eyes widen with

incredulity...then they get wider as he hears more.

INT.  CORRIDORS/SETTLEMENT - NIGHT

Thick smoke clogs the narrow corridors as RED winds through the

maze of corridors, coughing desperately.  He can hear VOICES

ahead.

INT.  DINING COMMONS/SETTLEMENT

RED charges into the commons, shouting excitedly.

He stops abruptly, seeing...

a blazing fire, whipped by wind from a shel hole in the ceiling,

consuming tables in the far half of the commons...

while JIMMY PIG, SLADE and SANDRA struggle with one end of a huge

beam that's fallen at an angle on top of a trap door in the floor,

the root cellar.

ELLEN, with NATHAN in her arms, TOMMY, WILL, JOHNNY and OTHER

CHILDREN hover behind her, staring at...

a six inch opening between the floor and the trap door where

EMMA, JUDITH and OTHER CHILDREN, unable to squeeze through the

six inch gap, peer out with frightened eyes, trapped.

As RED joins the effort.  SLADE snaps at him sarcastically as he

strains against the heavy beam.

The smoke is getting thicker.  EMMA and JUDITH are coughing,

looking scared.

SANDRA pushes at the beam with all her strength, fighting back

tears of despair.

The massive beam won't budge!  Eyes wide with terror, EMMA and

RUTH peer out of their trap.

INT.  COCKPIT/"DADDY" - NIGHT

CHURCH is in the cockpit now, hovering behind RUBRICK who's

speaking urging into the radio mike.

SLOAN is pacing, looks sick to her stomach with fear.

Now CHURCH is pacing back and forth, panicky, ranting...

EXT.  ABOVE THE TRENCH GARDEN

The radio in CRAWLER TWO is still SQUAWKING urgently with

RUBRICK'S VOICE as the crippled vehicle lies sprawled at a

violent angle over the trench garden.

Nearby, A VOICE is crying out in pain in the night.

Limping, TODD keeps his weapon ready as he searches out the

sound.

ANGLE ON THE INJURED SOLDIER, the one TODD crushed under the

treads of the CRAWLER.  He's screaming in pain.  Looks up.

TODD looms over the INJURED SOLDIER, weapon pointed.  Their eyes

meet.

In agony, the SOLDIER looks into TODD'S eyes, nods ever

so slightly.

BLAM!  BLAM!  TODD fires point blank.

Now the only sound is the ROARING of the WIND and the pathetic

sound of RUBRICK continuing his desperate RADIO BABBLE.

EXT.  INSIDE THE TRENCH GARDEN

As the RADIO CHATTERS, burning debris from the CRAWLER canted

over the garden illuminates the garden...and a BODY sprawled

there, fallen from the CRAWLER above.

BAM!  KABAM!  ROCKET FIRE!

EXT.  ABOVE THE TRENCH

TODD FIRES rockets into the damaged CRAWLER...until the RADIO

CHATTER stops abruptly.  RADIO killed dead.

INT.  DINING COMMONS/SETTLEMENT - NIGHT

The gap between the floor and the trap door has increased to ten

inches, enough for EMMA and RUTH to squeeze an INFANT through to

SANDRA'S reaching arms.

Soaked with sweat, gasping and coughing in the thickening smoke,

JIMMY PIG, SLADE and RED continue to strain at the beam...and it

moves.  Another inch!

The fire is raging.  The INFANT SQUALLS in SANDRA'S arms.  SLADE

snaps at her as he pushes on the beam.

ELLEN and the CHILDREN look alarmed as SANDRA gathers them and

ushers them toward the exit, glancing back toward the trap door

as she's leaving.

EMMA and RUTH meet her look with frightened eyes.

Noticing SANDRA'S hesitation, JIMMY PIG reassures her...

SANDRA and the CHILDREN exit.

And suddenly!!!  The beam slips back five inches, almost closing

the opening.  EMMA and JUDITH SCREAM!

JIMMY PIG, RED and SLADE look alarmed, defeated.

EXT.  ABOVE THE TRENCH GARDEN

TODD walks away from the smoking bulk of the CRAWLER canted over

the garden and drops into a traveling trench.

EXT.  INSIDE A PASSAGE TRENCH

Limping slightly, laden with weapons and still wearing his

helmet, TODD starts along the trench in the direction of the

settlement.

EXT.  INSIDE THE TRENCH GARDEN

In the shadows six feet below the overturned and smoldering

CRAWLER TWO, the BODY stirs on the floor of the garden, barely

visible in the flickering half light from the flames above.

It's CAINE 607.  He groans and stirs again.  He's not dead!  In

fact, he's rolling over, struggling to his knees.

INT.  DINING COMMONS

The frightened eyes of EMMA, RUTH and CHILDREN peer from the four

inch crack.

Whipped by wind from the hole in the ceiling, the fire is

spreading, the smoke is thick.  JIMMY PIG, SLADE and RED are

gasping with effort and coughing.  SLADE gasps to RED.

RED takes off at a run.

INT.  CORRIDOR

RED rushes through a smoky corridor.  Wherever shells have

punctured the roof, the WIND whips debris about.

EXT.  INSIDE THE GARDEN TRENCH

Sitting up now, using a flashlight, CAINE 607 is examining a

terrible gash in his thigh that reveals tissue and tendon.  The

right side of his face is also badly injured, flesh torn, swollen

and distorted.

He pulls the first aid kit from his utility belt, opens it,

focuses the light on the contents.

Selects a couple of pills.  Swallows them.  Considers.  Takes two

more.  Pulls out a hypodermic needle, injects his leg.  Takes

another needle, stabs his bloody cheek.

His eyes glitter as he feels the rush from the drug.  He looks

dangerous again in spite of his condition.

EXT.  INSIDE THE PASSAGE TRENCH

TODD reaches the settlement, enters a half collapsed doorway.

INT.  SUPPLY ROOM

RED is urgently rummaging through crowbars, coils of rope, sledge

hammers.  At last he finds two axes, grabs them and exits.

INT.  CORRIDOR/SETTLEMENT

TODD picks his way among collapsed walls, fallen timbers.

He peers through doorways, sees CORPSES.

Moves on.  Searching.

EXT.  INSIDE THE PASSAGE TRENCH

Dragging a freshly bandaged leg, CAINE 607 makes his way along

the trench toward the settlement.  He's using the wall for

support...but he seems to be getting stronger rather than weaker.

His face is hideous.

INT.  JUNCTION OF CORRIDORS

Carrying two axes RED zips around a corner and freezes...

RED'S POV of: A SOLDIER, seen from behind, moving down a smoky

corridor, helmeted, heavily armed, dangerous looking,

unidentifiable.

ANGLE ON RED, terrified, waiting till the SOLDIER (TODD) has

disappeared in the smoke.  Then RED hurries on down another

damaged corridor, axes in hand.

INT.  OTHER DAMAGED CORRIDOR

RED scoots around another corner and... stops short...an armored

torso a foot in front of his face.

Looking up, RED looks right into the distorted face of CAINE 607.

Before RED can react, CAINE 607'S hand shoots out and snatches

one of the axes.

Astonished, RED backs up a step, and raises the other axe to

defend himself.

RED'S POV OF CAINE 607 looming toward him, axe in hand.

ANGLE ON RED, turning and running.

ANGLE ON CAINE 607 limping along, dragging his leg as RED

disappears around a corner.

CAINE 607 rounds the corner in pursuit... and see only smoke,

no sign of RED.

INT.  DINING COMMONS

EMMA and JUDITH peer out from under the heavy metal trap door as

JIMMY PIG and SLADE desperately try to move the beam using a

piece of metal as a lever.

Just then RED bursts into the room with a single axe, shouting...

JIMMY PIG starts chopping furiously.

SLADE picks up a rifle, hands it to RED.

As RED looks at the rifle, alarmed, SLADE "comforts" him.

JIMMY PIG gasps for air as SLADE takes over chopping again.

RED exits, worried.

INT.  THE MEETING ROOM

Huddled in a makeshift shelter of overturned furniture, with

NATHAN asleep on her lap, SANDRA is reciting to ELLEN, WILL,

TOMMY, JOHNNY, ANGIE, eight year old RAMON.

SANDRA is reacting to vague movement in the shadows beyond the

door...and sounds.

She puts her hand over the mouth of a whimpering CHILD, hushes

another.

A timber falls outside the door and SANDRA sees a shadowy shape

enter the meeting room, looming in the darkness.

Frightened CHILDREN hold their breath, peer out fearfully.

CRACK!  SMASH!  The huge shape hurls aside the debris in his way,

switches on a flashlight, probes the darkness.

The light wipes the damaged room.

Suddenly, SANDRA gasps.

TODD maneuvers the flashlight beam, sees the frightened CHILDREN.

INT.  CORRIDOR

Peering into the smoke, RED reacts.

RED'S POV of CAINE 607, obscured by smoke, crossing the corridor

ahead, not seeing RED.

ANGLE ON RED, summoning all his courage, raising his rifle,

aiming.

BANG!

ANGLE ON CAINE 607 reacting, looking toward RED.

ANGLE ON RED scared to death, firing again!  And again!

ANGLE ON CAINE 607 wrenching a heavy door from its hinges and

holding it in front of him, shielding himself from RED's

continuous shooting, advancing.

ANGLE ON RED, firing again and again...and backing up.

ANGLE ON CAINE 607 holding the door/shield as he advances on RED.

Backing, RED trips, goes down flat on his back.

CAINE 607, only six feet away, hurls the door at him.

RED shoves the door aside, aims his gun up at CAINE 607, as the

huge soldier looms over him.

Before RED can pull the trigger, CAINE 607 snatches the rifle

barrel and yanks the weapon out of RED'S hands.

RED rolls, scrambles to his feet.

And CAINE 607 clubs him to the ground with the butt of the rifle,

crushes his skull with three brutal blows.

INT.  ROOM

TODD'S impassive face somehow reveals the alarm and awkwardness

he feels at what's happening to him.  TOMMY is seated on his

shoulders, he's got NATHAN in one arm and JOHNNY is nervously

looking up at him as he clutches at TODD'S huge free hand, and

now a little girl, SARAH, clutches at his combat pants as SANDRA

instructs her.

Clutching TODD's combat pants fiercely, SARAH looks up timidly at

the big stonefaced man as SANDRA turns to ELLEN.

ANGLE ON TODD'S stone face.  Unfamiliar territory.

Frightened faces look to the awkward "killing machine."

TODD looks like a statue decorated with CHILDREN.

JOHNNY is sobbing as he hangs onto TODD's giant hand obediently.

A SCREAM!  From the corridor!

SANDRA freezes.  TODD is alert, tense...and covered with

CHILDREN.

SANDRA turns and runs for the door as TODD starts to put the

CHILDREN down.  But he's awkward, slow, not his usual graceful

self, trying to be gentle like a clumsy man handling breakables.

INT.  CORRIDOR

Bursting into the corridor, SANDRA sees ELLEN racing toward her,

weaving through broken beams, SCREAMING as CAINE 607 lumbers

after her out of the shadows.  CAINE 607 doesn't bother to avoid

obstacles, shoving beams aside like twigs, dragging his bad leg.

ELLEN dives into SANDRA's arms and SANDRA turns, only three steps

ahead of CAINE 607, and rushes into the meeting room.

INT.  MEETING ROOM

TODD is just putting NATHAN gently on the floor when he sees

CAINE 607 arrive in the doorway.  For halt a second their eyes

meet, then --

CAINE 607 advances on TODD.

Still encumbered by CHILDREN clutching at him, TODD sees his

weapons, but can't get to them.  Then it's too late!

The terrified CHILDREN watch as the giant CAINE 607 clubs TODD

mercilessly with the rifle butt, then hurls him backwards like a

rag doll.

Horrified, SANDRA sees TODD slam into a wall, slump to the floor.

Dismissing TODD, CAINE 607 turns, looms toward the CHILDREN.

CAINE 607 ignores her, heads for ELLEN, dragging his bad leg.

Spotting TODD'S weapons, SANDRA snatches a heavy rocket rifle,

brings it up awkwardly, points it, FIRES!

And the kick from the heavy gun sends SANDRA sprawling back, the

weapon trembling from her hands.

But the WHIZZING ROCKET, a near miss, gets CAINE 607's attention.

He turns away from ELLEN, toward SANDRA.

ANGLE ON TODD rising to his knees, blinking stupidly, trying to

focus as blood pours into his eyes from a gash in his forehead.

TODD'S POV, a vague, unfocused image of SANDRA, snatching a

bayonet from TODD'S gear on the floor and lunging courageously at

CAINE 607.

Vaguely, TODD sees CAINE 607 parry her thrust effortlessly and

grab her.  As she beats at CAINE 607 bravely with her fists, the

big man slams her into a wall brutally.  As she crumples, he hits

her again.

ANGLE ON TODD struggling to his feet, staggering as he shakes his

head to clear it.

His eyes go to SANDRA, slumped against the wall, bloody.

Terrified CHILDREN look up at CAINE 607 as he towers over them.

Suddenly...

SHTUNK!  A knife blade suddenly sticks in CAINE 607's neck.

CAINE 607 only flinches... and, as he YANKS the knife from his

neck by the handle, he turns to see who threw the blade...

WHAM!  TODD slams into him, tackling him, driving his big

shoulder deep into the new soldier's waist, slamming the big man

hard into a wall.

Air goes out of CAINE 607, the knife drops from his hand.

But that's it for TODD's victory.  Six-five, two-sixty, CAINE 607

is bigger and stronger than TODD.  His powerful arms rip TODD off

him like he's taking off a Band-Aid.

Terrified, wide-eyed CHILDREN watch TODD hurled back across the

room.

TODD scrambles to his feet, shakes his head clear.

Here comes CAINE 607, dragging his bad leg.

TODD attacks!  Combining a martial arts feint and lunge with a

vicious kick!

But 607 counters expertly, brushing aside the attack!

TODD lunges again employing yet another skilled move.

SMACK!  CAINE 607 outmaneuvers TODD again, punishing him

brutally.

WHACK!  WHAM!  SMASH!  CRUNCH!  This time TODD jolts the bigger

man with a terrible combination of moves, smashing him in the

Adam's apple, kicking him in the knee, driving an elbow into the

jaw.

This time it's CAINE 607 who has to back away to recover.  And

now he seems to re-consider TODD, revealing for the first time a

genuine respect.

As their eyes meet, CAINE 607 seems to be saying "All right then,

you're serious, let's do it, fella."

TODD lunges.

SMASH!  CAINE 607 creams him.

TODD twists, slams CAINE 607 back.

BASH!  A fist to the face!

UMMMMMPH!  A knee in a groin!

SLAM!  A head against a wall!

VIDEO SCREEN/COCKPIT/"DADDY" - NIGHT

His face tanned from his Caribbean vacation, his image blurred

and distorted by transmission, MEKUM'S VIDEO IMAGE stares

incredulously from the snowy video monitor in the cockpit.

As SLOAN and RUBRICK look on uneasily, an indignant CHURCH

addresses the image on the screen.

CHURCH flashes a scowl at SLOAN as, on the screen, MEKUM erupts

excitedly.

Delighted with his own genius, MEKUM smiles triumphantly from the

video screen as RUBRICK, SLOAN, and CHURCH exchange stunned looks

and we...

INT.  MEETING ROOM - NIGHT

WHUMP!  TODD's bloodied head is slammed on the floor.  His eyes

are almost swollen shut as he looks up at CAINE 607 kneeling on

top of him.  Both men are bloody and exhausted their breath

coming in gasps, but it's CAINE 607 who's on top, beating the

last bit of resistance out of TODD who struggles desperately one

more time...before he slumps unconscious.

Horrified, NATHAN sees CAINE 607 smash the unconscious TODD with

the last of his strength, "finishing him off."  NATHAN can't

stand it.

He toddles toward CAINE 607, who's still on all fours, and

attacks, his tiny fists raining blows on the amazed monster's

bloody face.

The frightened CHILDREN see CAINE 607 ignore NATHAN's ineffectual

blows and struggle with enormous effort to his feet.

Once standing, he looks down at NATHAN beating at his knees.  For

a moment he's confused.  What's this?

Then he sees the frightened CHILDREN and orients himself.  When

he looks down at NATHAN again, tiny NATHAN is an enemy as good as

dead.  One blow and...

But just then big hands close around CAINE 607's ankles, tackling

him.  As the giant topples, TODD lets go of the ankles and crawls

on top of the fallen man.

As CAINE 607 looks up into TODD's fierce face, the fight goes out

of his eyes.  He knows he's beaten, he knows TODD will never

quit.  He's helpless as TODD grips him in a terrible hold and as

TODD puts the pressure on, CAINE 607 whispers...

SNAP!  TODD breaks CAINE 607's neck and watches the life go out

of him.

In the sudden silence as TODD, panting, stares at his defeated

enemy, he hears a VOICE...her VOICE...very weak...

TODD turns and sees SANDRA slumped against the wall where Caine

607 threw her.  There's a trickle of blood coming from a nostril,

more blood in her hair.  Her eyes don't look right.

TODD sees NATHAN looking at his mother with fear in his eyes.

Struggling to his feet, TODD picks up NATHAN and puts the boy

down close to his mother.

SANDRA reaches out and takes NATHAN's hand.  She holds NATHAN's

hand toward TODD.

TODD looks confused.

There are tears in SANDRA's eyes as she pushes NATHAN's little

hand into TODD's huge left paw.

TODD looks down at the joined hands, then he looks into SANDRA's

flooded eyes.

Does TODD understand her gesture?  His face is impassive.  Maybe

he doesn't.  Just then a hand touches his shoulder.

TODD turns to see JOHNNY face him, trembling but valiant, to ask

the question the others are fearful of asking.

TODD sees all the CHILDREN looking at him, their eyes big with

hope and fear as we...

INT.  DINING COMMONS

Blackened with soot, JIMMY PIG still has the axe in his hand as

SLADE manages, with a supreme effort, to hold the door of the

root cellar up enough to allow EMMA and JUDITH to push the FOUR

CHILDREN out of the cellar and then to scramble after them.

Exhausted, SLADE lets the door fall back, picks up his rifle and

turns toward the exit.  And freezes.  Dumbfounded.

Standing in the doorway is TODD, laden with CHILDREN, on his

shoulders, in his arms, surrounding him, clutching at his

garments.

INT.  CORRIDOR/"DADDY" - NIGHT

CRUDE LETTERS scrawled on the metal skin of the bomb say "LOVE

FROM DADDY."

The heavy bomb is lugged along a long narrow corridor.

We see that RILEY and three other VETERANS -- GREEN, CHESLEY, and

MOORE -- are struggling to maneuver the heavy bomb along the

narrow corridor and down a ladder hatch as SLOAN follows on

their heels and CHURCH and RUBRICK, fretting, follow her.

INT.  BOWELS OF THE SHIP - NIGHT

THE TIMER on the bomb CLICKS into action, ticking off seconds and

blurring off the tenths.

ANGLE ON SLOAN, punching a code into the device as she addresses

the four VETERANS.

RILEY, his face impassive, opens a hatch, revealing the darkness

outside where the wind SCREAMS.

As RUBRICK and CHURCH watch, the four VETS stagger into the

darkness with the bomb, RUBRICK has to shout to CHURCH to be

heard over the wind outside.

As SLOAN shuts the hatch, she checks her watch.

EXT.  SPACESHIP/"DADDY"

Carrying the heavy bomb in a sling, RILEY, CHESLEY, MOORE, and

GREEN stagger past the work-lights into the darkness while the

wind rages around them.  Holding the sling one-handed, GREEN is

illuminating the ground ahead with a flashlight.

INT.  COCKPIT/"DADDY"

Flick!  Flick!  Flick!  Flick!  SLOAN is flicking switches as

RUBRICK reads off a check list and she responds to each item on

the list with "Roger."

CHURCH is punching buttons on the control console, causing lights

to light up reading "Port Power Cluster," "Starboard Power

Cluster," "Vertical Stabilizer Unit," and so on.

EXT.  TERRAIN

Darkness!  Buffeted by the wind, RILEY and his COMPANIONS lower

the bomb to the ground and release it gently.  They're just

turning to go back, fighting the wind, when RILEY senses

something.  He takes the light from GREEN and points it.

The four VETERANS axe astonished at what they see.

CRAWLER ONE, battered and motionless, is abandoned only ten yards

away.

The flashlight beam probes the blown out windshield, the scarred

chassis, pans across the back seat...and pans back urgently,

glimpsing tiny EYES.

The EYES disappear behind the back seat.

RILEY, CHESLEY, GREEN and MOORE exchange glances.

The light probes again, this time revealing the frightened faces

of CHILDREN cowering in the back seat, hiding from the wind.

Suddenly RILEY whirls.

Out of the darkness beside him, TODD looms.

RILEY looks into the face of a man he saw killed!

TODD has a CHILD in each arm and another hanging on to his leg

for dear life.  He's wearing the scarf Jimmy Pig gave him.

In the shadows behind TODD, JIMMY PIG, SLADE, EMMA, JUDITH and

more CHILDREN are watching anxiously.

RILEY's stone face comes as close to expression as it ever

will...astonishment!

The other VETERANS stare too, amazed.

Suddenly RILEY gives TODD a smart military salute.

ANGLE ON JIMMY PIG and SLADE exchanging a look of wonder.  What's

going on here?  They haven't a clue!  And we...

INT.  COCKPIT/"DADDY" - NIGHT

The countdown clock is TICKING away, showing ten minutes, as

CHURCH, RUBRICK, and SLOAN complete their pre-launch prep.

CHURCH relaxes, looks up at the clock, satisfied.

CHURCH considers for a moment, then shrugs.

SLOAN is listening intensely.

All they hear is the HUM of the air system and miscellaneous

WHITE NOISE.

CHURCH and RUBRICK exchange a glance and are about to speak when

they all hear it...

A sound like a CHILD CRYING somewhere in the ship!

All three of them stare at each other in utter amazement.

Just then they hear it again, closer.

CHURCH frowns.  What the fuck?

INT.  BUNKS/"DADDY" - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

EMMA, JUDITH, SLADE and JIMMY PIG are settling most of the

CHILDREN in the cramped crew quarters, pulling off hats and

coats, when a COMMOTION causes them to look toward the open door

to the corridor in time to see...

a glimpse of RUBRICK being shoved roughly along the corridor by

MOORE, his loud protests clearly audible.

Then, as RUBRICK is pushed out of view, CHURCH appears, indignant

and panicky, as CHESLEY hustles him past.

ANGLE ON THE PIONEERS, exchanging glances.

INT.  CORRIDOR/"DADDY"

As CHESLEY shoves him along, CHURCH continues to protest...

CHURCH breaks off, suddenly speechless at the sight ahead of him.

Here comes TODD, laden with more CHILDREN, the tattoo on his

cheek clearly visible.  His eyes meet CHURCH'S.

Weak at the knees, CHURCH is still stammering as CHESLEY shoves

him ahead.

And then SLOAN, in the grip of GREEN, is hustled by.  She looks

wide-eyed at TODD and the CHILDREN.

INT.  BOWELS OF THE SHIP - NIGHT - SECONDS LATER

RUBRICK, CHURCH, and SLOAN are still protesting as the VETERANS

hustle them down the ladder toward the main hatch.

RUBRICK is shoved out the door into the night!

EXT.  SPACESHIP/"DADDY" - NIGHT

RUBRICK desperately clutches at the hatch entrance as the savage

wind tears at him...but he can't hold on.

As SLOAN and CHURCH are shoved out the hatch, they see RUBRICK

blown off into the night, screaming.

And CHURCH dives for the ground as the wind tumbles him.

SLOAN does the same thing as the hatch door slams behind them,

shutting them out of the ship..

INT.  COCKPIT/"DADDY" - NIGHT

The countdown clock shows four minutes and twenty seconds as it

CLICKS off the seconds.

Their soldier faces inscrutable, TODD and RUBRICK consider the

various lights winking on the control panel.

RILEY points to a row of switches and looks at TODD.  Their eyes

meet.  TODD considers the switches, then nods.

RILEY throws the switches.  A row of red lights goes on and the

ship seems to hum with life.

Still communicating wordlessly, TODD points to another switch,

RILEY throws it!

EXT.  SPACESHIP/"DADDY"

BLAST OFF!  Big engines belch fire, illuminating the bleak

landscape as the ship rises into the night.

Brightly lit by the ignition, SLOAN, still on her belly, sees the

ship taking off.

The bomb is clearly visible ten yards away in the dying glow of

the takeoff.

CHURCH bumps madly along the ground on his belly.

EXT.  SPACESHIP/"DADDY"

The NAF ship "Daddy" climbs off into space, getting smaller and

smaller, the light from the takeoff diminishing.

EXT.  THE BOMB/TERRAIN

The countdown timer on the bomb is faintly visible in the dying

light.  It reads twenty seconds.

CHURCH and SLOAN are hunched desperately over the bomb in near

darkness, the wind tearing at them.  SLOAN tries to punch a code

into the keys...

SLOAN punches the keyboard blindly.

BAHWHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!  Everything is dazzling, blinding light!

INT.  COCKPIT/"DADDY"

White light from the blast briefly floods the cockpit as TODD and

RILEY stare at the video monitor where MEKUM'S VIDEO IMAGE is

babbling frantically.

RILEY turns to TODD, looking a question at him.  TODD meets his

look and no words are necessary.

RILEY reaches for the control switch as MEKUM continues babbling.

MEKUM'S IMAGE cuts out mid-babble.

TODD and RILEY turn to see SLADE in the entrance to the cockpit

addressing TODD and the VETERANS collectively.

With that, SLADE turns and exits.

TODD looks at RILEY, RILEY looks at TODD.  What the fuck was

that?

INT.  CORRIDOR/"DADDY" - NIGHT

NATHAN wobbles along an empty corridor, stumbles, catches himself

on a wall, keeps going.

He passes a doorway, peers in, sees two SOLDIERS working at a

console like robots.  They don't look up.

NATHAN keeps going, toddling toward a hatchway.

INT.  COCKPIT/"DADDY"

Entering, NATHAN moves among the legs of big men, VETERANS.

NATHAN keeps going.

Then, backing against a wall, he looks up and VETERANS loom past

him with blank faces.  He is alone again.

NATHAN totters onward.

CLOSE ANGLE ON CHARTS, the same ones Church had on Christmas Eve,

showing tiny dots in a vast sea of space.

TODD and RILEY are poring over them, their eyes considering dot

after dot.  Finally, TODD points to a dot and looks a question at

RILEY.

RILEY considers the dot for a long moment...then he looks TODD in

the eye.

TODD looks back at the dot, considers it, looks back at RILEY.

RILEY nods a yes.

TODD is thoughtful...finally asks the next question.

TODD considers the dot on the map again, then looks at RILEY.

RILEY turns toward a console, but something makes him look down

toward his feat.  Then he looks back at TODD.

TODD follows the look.

Tiny NATHAN is looking up at TODD who's towering over him.

TODD looks down without expression, the scarf from Jimmy Pig

still wrapped around his neck.

NATHAN puts his arms out to be picked up.

TODD considers the outstretched arms.

RILEY looks from TODD to NATHAN and back to TODD.  What's this?

TODD hesitates a half second more, then leans down and picks

NATHAN up in his arms, lifting the boy to his chest.

RILEY looks on.  Never seen anything like it.

NATHAN is close to TODD's face, looking right into it, trying a

little smile, a nervous one, looking for a response.

TODD hesitates, takes a breath, moves the muscles of his face.

All he can produce is an awkward grimace, the distortion of a

smile, almost comical.

NATHAN reads the intention successfully.  His face collapses into

a huge friendly grin.

TODD tries again, making a clumsy sort of rubbery wince.

RILEY watches.  Totally amazed.

TODD turns, takes NATHAN to a porthole, puts his face up to it.

NATHAN stares out at the darkness punctuated by a billion stars,

a sky full of hope.

As NATHAN looks out, TODD works his face again, trying for a

smile the way a weak man might try to lift a heavy weight.

NATHAN looks at the stars outside, TODD looks with him and

suddenly TODD's face relaxes into an awkward grin, almost by

accident.

RILEY watches the two of them for a moment, confounded by what

he's seeing.  Then he turns to the console and...
