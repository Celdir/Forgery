INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

A young man, FREDDIE SUTTON (early 20s)_ speaks to a

What are you going to do when you get out

of here? You're going to have to wear a

belt for six months, maybe a year...

What kind of belt?

A surgical belt. You won't be able to do

very heavy lifting.

.I try to stay away from that.

But you spend time outdoors.

What do you do?

You didn't have very much on you when you

were admitted. Where were you going?

I was on my way to Placerville. To the

Fair. Had a job waiting for me, with a

friend of mine. He doesn't know where I

am.

How old are you, Freddie?

28.

2.

Why don't you turn honest?

You seem like an intelligent fellow.

'Quick on your feet - you like to drink?

It's a weakness. But I like it.

I know what the other is too.

How can you tell that? I'm clean.

The tattoo's.

Is that a weakness...

No one ever made money chasing girls.

You're wrong. This tatoo's my Auntie.

Who's that?

My Auntie Bertha, (she raised me.) But

that doesn't mean I don't have a

weakness...

College?

I tried that, it didn't work.

Why'd you leave?

Sometimes my hypo's get the best of

me, I really feel like walking into the

street and hitting people's hats off.

That's how you end up like this. With a

burst appendix.

3.

That's when I know it's time to get to

the sea.. what kind of belt?

A medical belt. Similar for lifting.

You're going to need some money. What do

you plan to do?

I'm going to pay back the hospital. And

you.

You don't owe me anything. I'm on surgical

duty. But you're expected to pay the

hospital for medicines. And your belt.

Alright. I intend to do that. You saying

you have a job for me? What? As an

orderly?

You couldn't be an orderly, it's too much

lifting -- and a lot of things you'd have

to learn. But maybe you could run an

elevator, something of that sort.

I want to get out of here, but I also

like it here. You think I was gonna die?

I know you were, Freddie.

I don't know. I'm not saying you didn't

save me... . but...I can't seem to die.

Too lucky?

Something like that.

Were you in the service?

Yes, sir.

Navy?

4.

Your luck was up this time, Freddie. You

should have seen the pus in your belly.

Something to think about.

It's not too late to stop being a

weisnheimer, no matter what you think.

you're still a young man.

talk with you -

You can talk standing in front of the

restaurant, around the corner --

He's left a little bloody, messy, no money in the alley.

FREDDIE is very drunk and dealing with a very

IRRITABLE/VAIN BUSINESS MAN who can't stop doing his

hair ...FREDDIE makes some smart ass comments (TBD) to THE

MAN. They argue back and forth until:

FREDDIE LOSES HIS TEMPER WITH THE MAN AND SNAPS. HE

KNOCKS OVER A LIGHT, DECIDES TO STEAL THE CAMERA WHILE

HE'S AT IT AND TAKE HIS HOME MADE BOOZE OF FILM

PROCESSING CHEMICALS WITH HIM. THE WHOLE TIME RANTING AND

Maybe a few months later, FREDDIE looks worse for wear.

He's been hired to work at a BEET DISTILLATE as a BENCH

CHEMIST. The FOREMAN walks him though the process; it's

clear that there is enough chemicals and beets here to

make some good booze...

MEXICAN and FILIPINO workers HARVEST THE BEETS, load them

to wagons - unload/wash - end up with FREDDIE: He works

the bench, making his HOME MADE VODKA. This stuff is

quite toxic and very strong. He places it in small, side

.somebody shut him up..

INT. BEET/SUGAR FACTORY. BUNKHOUSE. LATER

It's the middle of the night and all the WORKERS,

FILIPINO's condition has gotten worse...

The YOUNGER FILIPINO MAN wakes others up for help. . .The

DRUNKEN MAN is mumbling "I'm blind.." "I'm dying.." "my

eyes.."

FREDDIE TAKES NOTICE, COMES CLOSER... STARTS TO SIZE UP

THE SEVERITY OF THE SITUATION .AND REALIZES HE MAY/DOES

HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THIS...

.he backs away quietly-and starts to THROW SOME

THINGS INTO A BAG...

.WHEN SOME OF THE FILIPINO'S NOTICE HIM STARTING TO

LEAVE, THEY YELL AFTER HIM...

.FREDDIE TAKES OFF...

10.

AND THE FILIPINO'S GIVE CHASE.. .THEY MOVE INTO THE FARM

FIELDS.

EXTEND OUT. CHASE THROUGH THE FIELDS FREDDIE JUST RUNNING

AND RUNNING AS FAST AS HE CAN...

EXT. HIGHWAY - LATER.

LATER. off the side of the highway. Freddie collects

himself, obviously running for the past hour and evading

the Filipino's.

He hitches now...

EXT. DOCKS/SAN FRANCISCO - HIRING HALL - NIGHT.

Inside the crowded HIRING HALL, sailors, men looking for

work, etc. Freddie puts his name down. This is a short

burst of a scene, establish he wants to get back to sea,

wants work, but there's nothing for a few weeks.

EXT. DOCKS/SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT.

VARIOUS ANGLES. Freddie makes his way around the docks,

looking for something/anything. PLAY OUT.

He comes across a SHIP that's being readied for voyage.

It's an old cattle TRAWLER that seems converted to some

kind of CRUISE SHIP/PRIVATE YACHT-type vessel.

There's a buzz of getting ready around the ship also a

minor cocktail party in progress. (light music playing

from the ship...) DECKHANDS preparing to ship out, etc...

Freddie approaches the gang-plank...no one is there to

guard it. He walks straight up the gang plank and gets on

board the ship.

ANGLE, ON BOARD.

CAMERA follows him around... no one seems to notice or

care...

He goes down below...

ANGLE, BELOW DECK.

He sneaks around... some YOUNG MEN are getting dressed in

TUXEDOS.

11.

This plays itself out...FREDDIE finds a small CLOSET with

a TUXEDO and slips it on. He gets swallowed up into this

group of young men and acts as if he belongs --

.THE SHIP PULLS AWAY. HEADING OUT SAN FRANCISCO BAY...

.FREDDIE HEADING UP INTO A WELL APPOINTED CABIN...

A COCKTAIL PARTY IS IN FULL SWING AS THE SHIP LEAVES S.F.

There are all manner of people here, in this area,

everyone seems quite happy, chatty. Middle aged couples,

single middle-aged men, young couples, some kids,

teenagers, etc.

Freddie working near the bar, starts delivering drinks...

A live PIANO TRIO playing. FREDDIE NOTICES:

A LARGE MAN IN HIS MID-40s, all red-hair, red eyebrows,

red lips sings and dances while holding a baby It's a

bit blurry across the room from Freddie's POV

The SONG ENDS and everyone laughs, applauds, collapses.

KIDS run around...

ANGLE, THE BAR.

The BARTENDER whispers to Freddie; indicates he's POURED

TWO SHOTS FOR THEM TO SNEAK ... FREDDIE and the BARTENDER

reach and grab them, shoot them back...

INSTANTLY, FREDDIE'S HEAD POUNDS.

You feel alright?

Yeah, fine.

12.

Why don't you go lay down, I'll take

over...

Freddie walks off. FREDDIE doesn't seem DRUNK he SEEMS

DRUGGED. He walks down the hall - AND IN AN INSTANT FALLS

FLAT ON HIS FACE. DEAD WEIGHT. He's dragged off.

FADE OUT.

INT. SMALL DARK ROOM - LATER.

FREDDIE wakes up MASTER OF CEREMONIES is here along with

MARY SUE and NORMAN CONRAD does the speaking at first,

Freddie in and out of consciousness:

How are you doing?

Alright. What is this?

How'd you get on this shit?

I walked.

Why?

I was just looking f'work... I'm working

here.

MASTER OF CEREMONIES

You need to sit down.

I need to sit down.

Freddie is already sitting in a chair they have him in.

Whatdchu put in my drink?

You've been sedated.

I'm sleepy.

13.

I know you are. But you need to wake up

that for me? I want you to ask some

questions about why you're here.. .how you

BEAT. Freddie just looks at him, then MASTER SPEAKS:

MASTER OF CEREMONIES

You're an able bodied seamen?

I am.

You've had your appendix removed.

Why didn't you just ask if you could join

You need work? We'd love to have you

I just want to go to sea. I am looking

for a berth--

What's wrong with where you were?

I'm a seamen.

What wrong with the world from where you

were?

PAUSE. FREDDIE closes his eyes, sleepy a minute.., then:

You're a Russian spy. Did you hear me?

Wake up, Freddie.

What do you want? .what's your name?

We've told you. You're a russian spy.

What are you escaping.

Nothing.

You did something.

Well you shouldnt drink so much liquor,

yourself.

PAUSE. Freddie is slipping out of it.

Would you like to stay with us a little

while?

Sure.

We can give you the guidance you need in

your life.

Thanks.

We can give you the guidance you need in

your life.

Thanks.

Why you don't you just get some more

rest?

LONG PAUSE. Freddie's eyes close ane he passes out again.

This boy is just a simple stow-away. All

things he says he is.

I believe...

Master fiddles around with his things, belongings,

wallet, out on a table. He looks at the FLASK. Smells it.

Pours the contents into a glass; looks at the liquid.

18.

He drinks it. He lets it run down his body, feels the

drink. He drinks some more.

Delicious... delicious

There should be nothing above suspicion.

EXT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

FREDDIE is dragged by to ASSISTANTS down the narrow

hallways of the SHIP. . .down another hallway, down

another...

EXT. THE SHIP - PACIFIC OCEAN - NIGHT.

CAMERA MOVES WITH THE SHIP, SILENTLY MOVING ALONG AT

NIGHT.. .SEES THE LIGHTS GLOW FROM INSIDE...

INT. ROOM - MORNING.

CU. FREDDIE.

Morning sun comes in, hits him in the face. Wakes him up.

He looks around. He looks out the window.

INT. HALLWAY - SHIP - MOMENTS LATER

FREDDIE walks out, looks around. . .he walks down the hall,

a YOUNG GIRL passes him, smiles wide and says "GOOD

MORNING," ad keeps walking...

He moves towards a room where he hears a TYPEWRITER. He

steps in the doorway. MASTER sits at his desk, writing

gear all around. MASTER looks up, sees him, stops

typing...

Smiles. Extends his arm out for Freddie to come in and

take a seat.. .MASTER is warm, inviting. Not rushed. They

sort of sit and settle with each a moment;

19.

Ok?

Alright.

You can't be...

Is this your ship?

I'm it's Commander, yes.

Where's it going?

New York City thru the canal. You're

seamen?

Yes.

You're looking for work?

.what did I say last night...?

You said you were an able bodied seamen

and you were looking for work?

You have any?

Perhaps.

What was in my drink?

You were sedated with chloral hydrate and

bubble gum kisses. Ha ha ha. I'm sure if

your check your butt-hole you'll find

it's all in working order (he he he...)

Isn't that what all men are worried about

in they surrender themselves.

I didn't surrender myself.

20.

You were acting very aggressive because

you drank too much alcohol.

I don't think I was.

Yes I think you were. And I don't like

strange boys jumping on my ship.

So what are you gonna do?

Why don't you just ask for work? Work

can't be hard to find.

Depends on when you're ready to go...do

you have a job for me.

You can't work in your condition.

What condition is that?

You're aberrated.

What's that mean?

A wandering from the path

The problems you have in your life (your

appendix, your work, your need to batter

your body with booze...) I resolve that

they can be fixed.

I've got no trouble. You got a job for me

to do, I can do it.

Maybe I do, but not the kind you think.

Do you own this ship?

21.

A charter though the Explorer's Club.

.What do you do?

I am many things. I am writer, a doctor,

a nuclear physicist, a theoretical

philosopher. Above all, I am a man, A

hopelessly inquisitive Man, just like

you.

Where's your money come from?

Many years of successful writing and

publishing has made me self sufficient.

Reader's in all languages have enjoyed my

work - but now I'm retired to study the

mid and the spirit...my life's true work.

These studies have made me a target and I

am hunted for what I know. Which is

why... it is so un-wise to go lurking and

jumping on strange ships.. .how do we know

what your motives are?

.well: I apologize if I got a little

out of hand last night - I'm just...

looking for work and your ship looked

good, so...it's a nice looking ship.

Don't apologize. You're a scoundrel. How

I miss the days of working a four

mastered schooner with nothing but salt

horse, dried peas and a couple quarts of

water.. .the present-day maritimer's seem

so much more fragile, don't you think?

You - you're and adventurer.

22.

An able bodied seamen, a maker of wine,

and a dashing mischievousness is what I

knew would come to me in this-lifetime.

.would you study with me? Submit

yourself?

I don't understand what you're talking

about.

I am always looking for mature men of

unusual ability who are willing to

stretch the boundaries of what they know.

To increase knowing-ness and

communication amongst man. I need day-ta.

And with your help, I can gather it...

You already understand, you just need to

remember. And only say yes. Say, 'yes.'

I'm not saying yes to anything I don't

Master holds up the FLASK..

What's-about-this?'

What about it?

As a Scientist and a Conniseur I have no

idea the contents of this remarkable

potion, what's in it.

Secrets.

Can you make more?

23.

I'll grant you a full reprive from your

naughtiness as a stow-away if you make us

some more. I must admit I sampled some

and ended up drinking it all.

It's just booze.

Horrible Hooch?

Horrible Hooch.

BEAT. They both smile, laugh a little. MASTER gets up and

comes over him...

Would you scrub yourself up and make

yourself clean?

My daughter is getting married.

Come and join us and leave your worries

for a while, they'll still be there when

you get back..he he he. You are invited.

INT. LITTLE ROOM - LATER.

FREDDIE IN A LITTLE ROOM, SHOWERED, CLEANED UP, NICE SUIT

ON, CHECKS THE MIRROR AND EXITS...

INT./EXT. SHIP - MOMENTS LATER - DAY.

MASTER waits for him-they walk together...CAMERA leads

them-they go up on DECK...OUT INTO THE PACIFIC OCEAN

AIR...

I think we have known each other before

you and I -

Oh yeah?

It will come out over time, but yes. We

are re-united... do you reember me?

24.

.I don't know...

That's alright. Don't strain yourself.

You will. There will be much time to

discuss this on the journey to our

destination. As we travel down Time-

Holes...you won't be afraid will you?

.what destination?

Have you ever had harm cme to you?

Sure.

What if we could return to a period of

your life where there was harm and do

away with it? .would You like that?

Ok.

That's where we go.

They come across ALL THE PEOPLE ON BOARD. THEY WALK INTO

THE GROUP. Everyone is getting ready for a WEDDING. . .they

greet MASTER and FREDDIE. He walks into it and is

welcome'd...

MASTER finds his daughter, ELIZABETH, who is to be

married and her husband-to-be CLARK (20s) He introduces

them to Freddie -

EXT. DECK OF SHIP. AFTERNOON.

ZOOM BACK FROM CU. On MASTER as he presides over his

DAUGHTER's WEDDING. ELIZABETH and CLARK. Everyone dressed

up; Master says some sweet,. beautiful words and then;

.as long as you hold these bodies, in

this life: you may kiss the bride.

THEY KISS. APPLAUSE, CHEERS. CU. FREDDIE. He listens and

watches.

25.

INT. DINNER CABIN. NIGHT.

It's mid-dinner, post-wedding ceremony party, everyone is

celebrating, drinking. Master talking a blue streak,

acting this out.

Now, now, now, how 'bout this: Here it

comes - swooping down on me: A LARGE

DRAGON, TEETH AND BLOOD DRIPPING! RED

EYES!

What do I go? A lasoooo! Whip it up, wrap

it around it's neck. I wrastle, wrastle,

wrastle'em to the ground - I snap up, I

say: sit.

Everyone laughs, Master is acting all this out, rolling

around, etc as if he's training a dog...

Dragon sits. I say: stay. Sragon stays.

So now he's got a leash on and he's

staying on my command - THAT"S WHAT WHERE

WERE AT WITH IT NOW - it stays on

command.

Everyone is laughing, lapping it all up. He glances;

Next we're gonna teach it to roll over

and play DEAD.

Master sits down, starts speaking to someone about his

days studying Judo ...

FREDDIE, sitting up at the dinner table-across the

table is: VAL, strikes up conversation:

Freddie, I'm Val, the son.

Hello.

Are you having a good time?

Yes.

What are you goign to be working on?

26.

I don't really know.

Have you done any time-hole work?

I don't think so.

VAL is distracted by a WELL WISHER who comes over.

FREDDIE looks around at everyone. All the faces having a

good time and celebrating...

He catches the eye of a YOUNG WOMAN. . .then sees her

HUSBAND...

The BARTENDER comes over to FREDDIE

Alright, old man?

Yeah.

No hard feelings?

No.

Welcome aboard. Clif Amsbury.

He serves him a drink.

This one's alright. Chink, chink.

ANGLE, LATER.

Master is saying good-night to everyone, passes FREDDIE

and says quietly:

When can we have some of your potion?

Whenever you'd like. I'll get making it -

When I'd like it - I will give you a

signal. I will scratch my ear and rub my

nose. What will you need?

27.

I'll take care of it.

MASTER makes his way down the table trying to say goodbye

to everyone, he finally tears away from the party by

Enough! Enough! I must get back to work!

Keep going! Dont stop all night long!

He leaves. FREDDIE just looks around, caught up in it

all.

INT. ROOM - LATER.

Freddie comes down into his little room. A cot has been

made for him, some fresh clothes and a BOOK

(hardcover,400pages) on the bed. It reads, very simply:

CU. BOOK "THE CAUSE"

The cover is opened, CAMERA SEES IN CU the opening line

from the book: "Shall a man be master of his memories? Or

shall his memories be the master?"

ANGLE, FREDDIE

He lays in bed and reads the book. He reads about to

lines and his eyes slam shit, asleep, still holding the

book.

HOLD.

INT. MAIN DECK / CABIN - MORNING.

It's the next morning, EVERYONE IS HERE FOR BREAKFAST,

BUFFET STYLE, FREDDIE mixed in amongst it all.

FREDDIE sits down to eat with MARY SUE, who feeds her

baby. The other children around. VAL and NORMAN CONRAD

are here...

He's been writing all night ...I think

you've inspired something in hi,. When

we're at home, on land, there's too much,

pulling him in each direction.

28.

MARY SUE (CONT'D)

He was working on a book that showed how

the Russians used narcosynthesis and

physical torture and how it worked as it

did. That was interrupted.

He had a technology oh psychological

warfare to present to the Defense

Department. All that was interrupted,

lost. Each time he sits to write, a new

attack is launched against him and he

spends too much time on defending

himself. I tell him to ignore it, but

he's so sensitive...

Who's attacking him?

People that are scared. People that are

greedy. Ex-wives...That's what's so nice

about being at sea. He gets his studies

done, advances the learning, and he

writes BOOK II.

What's a time-hole?

INT. SMALL CLASSROOM - LATER.

It's a dimly lit little room. A few folding chairs and a

small stage. A YOUNG GOD LOOKING COUPLE: WAYNE and SUSAN

DUNBAR (late 20s) are on stage. She is lying down, eyes

close, he is sitting in a chair next to her, students

watch as he runs an exercise with her; Mary Sue has

brought Freddie in here and sits with him in the

back.. .Freddie watches:

Say, "back beyond" and return to the pre-

natal area.

Back beyond. Back beyond. Back beyond.

Back beyond. Back beyond. Back beyond.

Continue please...

Back beyond..I Have.. something in my

face... It feels like I am being pushed.

29.

Contact it more closely and continue to

repeat.

Back beyond. Back beyond. It's getting

stronger.

I hear a voice..It's my father's voice.

Listen to the words and repeat them,

please.

He is talking to my mother. The face

pressure is hurting. It's uncomfortable.

It keeps going up and down and it hurts.

Repeat his words, please.

"I don't want to come in you now. Let's

wait." The pressure is banging my face.

Into my face. My mother is there, her

voice...

What is your mother saying? Please, if

you hear her?

She saying "well get out of there then. I

don't want you in me at all if your not

there to come. Get in to come." She's

mad.

Please return to the start of this and

recount.

I wonder what they're doing? I hear a

squishing sounds and it's wet. Oh. Oh my.

Recount please.

30.

A faint rhythm ...then faster. I hear my

fathers voice say, "oh honey..I wont come

in you now. I'm not too sure I like

children that well and I have my job to

worry about..." And my mother must shove

him - a sharper pain here - "THEN I DON'T

IN THERE AT ALL, GET OUT.."

Return to the beginning and recount it

again, please.

CU. FREDDIE's FACE

Listening. Mary Sue leans over and whispers:

MARY SUE (WHISPERS)

Do you understand what's happening?

Yes.

She hold her pregnant stomach;

We record everything.

INT. SHIP - VARIOUS. NEXT MORNING.

FREDDIE moves around, CAMERA follows him, collecting

VARIOUS SUPPLIES to start making a home-made potion of

booze. POTATOES, PAINT THINNER, ORANGES, YEAST. (TBD,

OTHER CONTENTS OF THE SHIP) that could go into a recipe --

INT. BOOZE ROOM - LATER.

He's set up in an area of the ship to start distilling

BOOZE from the found ingredients on the ship. WATCH, HOLD

THIS. The BARTENDER/FOLLOWER is here to give him some

help. (poss. Bartender telling him how came to 'the

cause' here...)

31.

INT. STUDY ROOM - LATER.

HE WALKS THROUGH THE LIBRARY ROOM, WATCHING A GROUP OF

FOLLOWERS READING, STUDYING, TALKING. LISTENING TO

HEADPHONES WITH MASTER'S VOICE SPEAKING. THIS IS THEIR

STUDY TIME.

He slips a PAIR of HEADPHONES ON, TAKES A SEAT AND

LISTENS. This is a recording of a LIVE LECTURE BY MASTER:

MASTER (V.0.)

.someone came up to me the other day,

and I had to say...I had to correct him.

He said, "I heard the Cause can fix me.."

I looked down at him and he'd lost his

legs. He's sitting in a wheel chair and

had no legs to speak of. I said, "We can

do very many things, sir...but no, we

cannot replace your legs. This is how

rumors get started." Let's talk about

what we can do...

FREDDIE looks around and watches all the STUDENTS on

their headphones. He tries to flirt and make eye contact

with all the WOMEN.

MASTER (V.0.) (CONT'D)

When did you decide you had limited

potentials and capabilities? You've

forgotten that this is all just a dirty

old game that YOU created.

An AID (Female, 40s) comes over;

How you doing?

I'm fine.

Are you following alright?

Well-not really-no...

That's OK. You will. Don't worry -

How long have you been studying

32.

A year. It takes a little time. Don't

worry.

What's your name?

Carol Henike. You're Freddie.

That's right.

Just keep listening and reading. If you

don't udnerstand, just keep going back

over it. Headphones back on...

He slips the headphones back on.

INT. MAIN CABIN - EVENING.

A SKETCH COMEDY SHOW, DANCING after-dinner. FREDDIE on

the sidelines, watching it, not really understanding some

of the humor and lyrics, etc...someone has a MOP on their

head and is pretending to be a PSYCHOLOGIST with a vary

thick/bad German-Austiran-accent. "zee muzzer and fazzer

and zee penisss and ze nippelz.." attempting to cure a

STUDENT... everyone LAUGHS.

ELIZABETH (the daughter) comes over;

Hi Freddie ...

Hi.

.I Have a message for you.

She rubs her nose and tugs her ear.

Better get along.

He leaves, she watches him go.

33.

INT. FREDDIE'S AREA. MOMENTS LATER.

He puts the booze into MASON JARS.

INT HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

FOLLOWING FREDDIE HOLDING THE BOOZE IN A LITTLE MASON

JAR.

INT. MASTER'S SUITE. THAT MOMENT.

Freddie pours the liquid into two glasses. WE HEAR THE

PARTY OUTSIDE THE ROOM, FROM UPSTAIRS. MASTER examines

What's in it?

.drink just a little.

It's very strong. The good stuff takes

time. And there's secrets in good liquor.

This is just booze for now...

How are you feeling, Freddie?

Good.

Rested?

Yes.

Excited?

Sure.

Have you made some friends?

Yes.

34.

Good. Good. How are you feeling?

Yeah, good.

They CHEERS AND DRINK. Shudder at the strength of it.

I've been writing ... BULAGH! Feel like I

went under. Dark cloud rolls in. Opens

up...anxious to share new work-would

you care for some informal processing?

Sure...

Well, then I gather myself... and you be

my protege and guinea pig, eh?

Informal processing.

Master smiles, excited, moves to an OLD TAPE RECORDER,

points a microphones towards Freddie, looks over some

papers...

Are you ready?

Yes.

HE FLIPS THE TAPE RECORDER ON. Master smiles, reads,

Say your name.

Freddie Sutton.

Say it again.

Freddie Sutton.

Say it again.

Freddie Sutton.

35.

Might as well say it one more time just

to make sure you know who you are...

Freddie Sutton.

Do you ever make thoughtless remarks.

I usually put some thought into them.

Do you browse though railway timetables

just for pleasure?

No.

Do you get occasional twitches of you

muscles when there is no logical reason

for it?

(flutters around goofy) Only on my good

days.

Do past failures bother you?

No.

Do past failures bother you?

No.

Do past failures bother you?

No. (some dice games I was in, he he.)

So past failures bother you?

.I don't know. . .you keep asking me..no,

not really.

36.

Is your life a constant struggle for

survival?

.not really ... .. life's alright.

Would you rather give orders than take

them?

Sure.

Are you often impulsive in you behaviour.

.sure... Yes.

Do other people interest you very much?

Not really (girls? They do)

Do you find it easy to be impartial?

Yeah.

Are you likely to be jealous?

No .about what?

Are you logical and scientific in your

thinking?

I'm..I don't know. Don't care about

science.

Do you rarely suspect the actions of

others?

I don't understand.

37.

Yes you do.

.I suspect people...yes. Sure. So...no,

rarely. Most people are ass's anyway.

Are you usually truthful to others?

.no... I don't know. Guess so.

Are your actions considered unpredictable

by other people?

HOLD. HOLD. Freddie seems to think about this questions

seriously, THEN: OUT OF THE PAUSE AND OUT OF THE BLUE HE

BLLLLLLLLLL GH.

How's that? (laughs hysterically)

Silly..its good to laugh in

processing.. sometimes we forget.

Master reaches down, brings the microphone to his mouth:

"Freddie Sutton, Test Session. May 5,

1952, 1800 hours. Aboard he sailing

vessel Aletheia, en route to New York

City. MOC logged ad approced."

He CLICKS it off. Smiles at Freddie; he gives him a

comforting hug.

Should we sample another sip before we

join them upstairs?

Is that it?

For now.

I'm ready for more if you want to ask

me...

38.

HOLD BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM. LONG PAUSE.

Ask me, Master. This is fun.. .nobody's

asked me questions before --

Could you answer the next series of

questions without blinking your eyes? To

without fear and hesitation answer as

quickly as you can?

Sure.

CU. TAPE RECORDER BACK ON.

Look at me...Starting now you are not to

blink. If you blink we go back to the

.infringement. you blinked. Starting

now you are not to blink. If you blink we

go back to the start.

Do you often ponder over your own

inferiority?

No.

Infringement. Back to the start. You

blink, we repeat from the start. Do you

often ponder over your own inferiority?

Yes.

Do you believe that God will save you

from your own ridiculousness and self

contempt?

No I don't.

Have you ever had intercourse with a

member of your family.

Yes.

39.

PAUSE.

Have you ever had intercourse with a

member of your family?

Yes.

.who?

PAUSE. Master is stumped for the first time...

Have you ever killed anyone?

No,

Maybe?

Not me.

TAPE RECORDING ALL THIS. DIALS MOVING. FREDDIE NOT

BLINKING.

Have you ever killed anyone.

No.

How many times did you have intercourse

with your aunt?

Three times.

Where is your aunt now?

Don't know. Probably Princeton.

Where?

40.

45 Province Lane.

Would you like to see her?

No.

Would you like to sleep with her again?

No.

Do you regret this?

No.

What is she doing now?

I don't know.

Where is your mother?

I don't know.

Freddie BLINKS.

INFRINGEMENT. Back to the start.

FUUUUUUUUUCKK. FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK.

BULLSHIT. FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK.

He slaps himslef around, opens his. eyes. HOLD.

Do you often ponder your own inferiority?

Yes.

Do you believe God is going to save you?

41.

No.

Have you ever had sex with a member of

your family?

Yes.

Are you lying?

No.

Who?

.FREDDIE

My Auntie Bertha.

Where is your aunt?

At home in new Jersey.

Are you lying?

No.

Are you a liar?

Yes.

Have you ever killed anyone?

Yes.

Who?

Japs.

In the war?

42.

Yes.

What are you running from?

Nothing.

The law?

.PAUSE...

I think I may have blinded a man. Maybe

he's dead, I don't know...

Where?

In Salinas, I served him up booze and he

drank too much of it.

Is the booze you make poison?

Not if you drink it smart, he was stupid.

Are you trying to poison me?

No.

Where is your father?

I don't know. (aka dead)

What is your Auntie's Name?

43.

Auntie Bertha.

How did you come to sleep with your

Auntie Bertha?

She said she'd let me have my inheritance

if I were to sleep with her. So I did and

I never got my money. I was drunk. She

looked good.

And you did it again and again.

Yes. Because I liked it. It felt good.

She's rich? Is she? She has your

inheritance, does she?

She controls it all.

You feel you're owed this?

I am.

Have you ever had any bad thoughts about

her or Mary Sue?

Yes.

What do you think?

I thought you were fools. But now I see

that you're not

If you could lock yourself in a house, a

large mansion for the rest of your life:

who would you like to be there with you?

Doris Schoemann.

Who is Doris?

Best girl I ever met. The girl I am gonna

marry one day.

She's in New Jersey, is she?

Lynn, Massachussets. ( I just got to get

back to her.)

Why aren't you with Doris?

Why aren't you with her?

I'm an idiot. I don't know. I got no

reason.

Do you love Doris?

Yeah.

Is she the love of your life?

Yes sir.

Close your eyes/

CUT TO BLACK, HOLD, THEN FADE UP AGAIN..

Release and return to me ...

Say your name.

Freddie Sutton.

Are you hear with me in 1952?

45.

Yes...

He laughs. They both laugh, MUSIC 'dancers in love'/piano

ver.

How does it feel?

Freddie laughs a little.

Feels good.

Left side of your body feels ok?

Yeah.

Right side?

Yeah.

Any headaches?

Are you a member of the Ninth Battle

Batallion?

I don't know what that is.

Are you a member of the Ninth Battle

Batallion?

No.

Or any other invader force? Space

stations or communication depots on this

planet or anywhere else?

46.

No, sir.

You're the bravest boy I've ever met.

Master turns off the tape recorder. They DRINK DOWN THE

BOOZE TOGETHER. Smile, laugh.

EXT. MANHATTAN SKYLINE - NIGHT.

ESTABLISH SHOT. 1950s. MOVING OVER THE WATER TOWARDS IT.

EXT. DOCKS/NEW JERSEY - NIGHT.

The SHIP HAS ARRIVED AND DOCKED. Everyone is rounding up

to disembark. Those leaving: MASTER, MARY SUE, ELIZABETH,

CLARK, THE BABIES, NANNIES, VAL AND FREDDIE. They all

head down the gang-way...

The New York City franchise owner/follower is a thin,

sickly man named: BILL WHITE (40s) He's very

nervous/anxious/eager to please, comes to greet them.

He's here with some other ASSOCIATES/FOLLOWERS:

Master! Hello. Yes. Welcome. Welcome back

to New York City, Master. It's our honor,

its our pleasure. We are humble and so

happy...

Thank you, Bill, good to see you.

BILL leads the way, waves his hand to the show:

We'd like to present you with this gift

from the New York Branch for your stay

here ...we know how fond you are of

motorcycles.

He presents a HARLEY-DAVIDSON..

Loooooooooook at that... 1940 Harley

Davidson Knucklehead. For me?

47.

He slides on, starts it up, everyone APPLAUDS. MASTER

TEARS AWAY ON THE MOTORCYCLE, everyone else [piles into

some OLD SEDAN'S driven by some New York Followers --

Everyone on deck of the ship waves good-bye and watches

them go.

EXT. CAUSE H.O./NEW YORK - AFTERNOON

MASTER and everyone comes in to the hotel/ballroom of a

fading mid-town hotel. Local students, followers are here

to greet ... about THIRTY people...

FREDDIE looks at the GIRLS. MASTER shakes hands, kisses

babies, etc...

BOOKS FOR SALE, DESKS, PARTITIONS, PAMPHLETS, REEL TO

REEL TAPE'S FOR SALE. BILL WHITE doing all the intro's,

liason work, etc... (note: Helen Sullivan here.) This

operation embryonic a little shabby...

INT UPSTAIRS/HOTEL. LATER.

Everyone here, a FLOOR of the hotel has been taken over,

adjoining rooms connecting everyone... CAMERA moves

around, seeing all the activity, movement-the ADULTS are

getting dressed and ready for something ... . FREDDIE

brings MASTER some booze. They cheers, drink ... MASTER

gets ready.."to past, present, future and the street

where they all meet and shake hands."

EXT. PARK AVENUE APARTMENT - NIGHT.

A very fancy APARTMENT ON THE PARK. The whole entourage

pulls up. MASTER on the Harley, everyone else in the

sedans..they head into a PARK AVENUE APARTMENT BUILDING;

CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM ALL IN. THE DOORMAN looks up;

BILL WHITE is quick to explain they're going to the

Penthouse to the party of Mrs. Purcell, etc..

48.

Make way, make way..thank you.

INT. HALLWAY. FANCY APARTMENT.

THE ELEVATOR OPENS into the grand palatial apartment; an

older WOMAN is the hostess, her residence: her name is

MILDRED PURCELL (eraly 70s) a very wealthy widower,

follower, benefactor... This is a SHOW AND

TELL/FUNDRAISER/COCKTAIL RECEPTION in honor of Master and

the Cause...

They applaud his entrance. About FORTY or so guests, some

RICH UPPER EAST SIDE PEOPLE, who are members of a

satellite group. Some others come to listen and learn,

etc... BILL WHITE makes introductions, etc.

MASTER is offered some appetizers, he says:

You can hear a tomato scream when you cut

it...this is why I don't eat tomatoes...

VARIOUS PARTY MINGLING/COVERAGE

MEET MRS. PURCELL and stay with her.-Everything settles

and she sets the stage for Master...

.FREDDIE Carries over an OLD REEL TO REEL TAPE PLAYER,

sets it on a coffee table in front of him...

As you can see I've brought props.

Everyone laughs.

Showman's trade secrets.. .he-he-he

More laughter.

Let me just listen to this tape...

He picks up the tape and lifts it to his ear..he wiggles

it around next to his ear..

Can't hear anything. But there's sound on

here, no? Sound to be found?

He puts the tape reels onto the player...

49.

This should do it!

He flips the switch. Nothing. No sound.

Hmmmm. Can' thear anything. Wait. There

are sounds on this tape, but I can't

hear... wait... how about this...

Nothing. He continues this ...he plugs the speakers

in.. . nothing again and again.

Well what do we have? We have the high

fidelity audio tape, we have speakers,

and yet..a ha! Just a moment.

He turns the machine "ON"...

This should do it...

Nothing.

Seems we're out of pieces..

Everyone laughs nervously...

I know there's sound on that tape...

He plugs the power cord into the wall... It crackles and

sound pours out.. It's MASTER'S VOICE.

MASTER (V.0.) (CONT'D)

Our life has never stopped and always

been. All of the recordings of our

lifetimes that we have lived are

available to us..

MUSIC STARTS TO PLAY. GENTLE PIANO MUSIC. MASTER turns

the volume down on the reel-to-reel, speaks live to the

Everything's there isn't it? On the tape?

Sure is, we just need to get it working

with all the other pieces in synch-ro-

nization. No good if it's not plugged

into the wall. Can't hear it. But the

sounds are still there. No good if those

speakers aren't there. Can't hear it.

50.

But that doesn't mean it's not there,

does it? No. It doesn't. That flimsy

little piece of tape is just nothin'

without all the other equipment lined up

properly, isn't it? We CAN access the

past, traumas and seeds that abberate us

in present time and once we access them -

we challenge them and throw them away.

Previously, I'd established how to access

these aberrations and painful memories to

pre-birth/cellular times.

But the new studies prove there is a time

beyond that. The Whole-of-time with which

we are now working. At last count,

perhaps sixty-seven trillion years our

studies show...

Besides the everyday struggles of how we

become better, more able, more productive

homo sapiens, the uses for this new

science is the location and removal of

certain leukemias, apathies, manics.

Depressives, perverts, stuttering,

neuroses, ulcers, arthritis, and asthmas.

This is the province and science of

Cause.

If you'll forgive me, I must sit down.

Perhaps you've taken notice of my leg

injury and limp damndest thing. You see

it happens every time I come to Manhattan

Island, its a wound I've never conquered

and I'll tell you how I found out about,

because I never knew what in the H was

happening...

Well I did some processing to find out.

Took Mary Sue to ay me down and lead me

back...we processed over three hours! And

something came up. It was this:

I lived a life before and suffered a

great injury. Knee injury...

It was just around 1888. A great number

and year. Significant as the creation .

year of the new york city sewer system if

I'm not wrong...

I was a thief and criminal, working late

into the night robbing a bank in the

western side of the island.

51.

The crime was committed with a revolver

in hand. A Cole .45. My accomplices and I

made it clear across town when we were

ambushed by the local authorities.

-- but I made a slip away. A digression

into the under constructed sewer system.

It was here that I could no be found - or

so my thinking went. All my confidence

and all my arrogance was brought upon me.

Full in the face. For I was nose to nose

with a twenty-five foot alligator in the

New York City sewer. Oh brother! What a

scare I was in for. Now if you've veer

seen the SNAP! SNAP! SNAP! OF A GATOR -

you'll remember the fear.

You see, this being an island, and in

those days more inhabited by creature

than man, why wouldn't I meet such a

beast?

In my evasion -- I dropped the gold. The

money I'd stolen in my getaway.. .not

dropped, but stuffed in a newly cemented

drain hole just around 125th

Street... present day Harlem County I

believe today. Yes. Yes.

I stuffed it and made a getaway from both

man and beast azshattered my knee in five

different places-turned into a piece of

glass..woke up early in the morning

somewhere near the present day Times

Square-which was nothing more than a

farm..quite a farm..but that's another

story.

So what does this say? Injuries stay with

us don't they??..They sure do. How's it

gonna go away. How? How? How'm I gonna

fix this knee. How are any of us going to

get better? More able?

We Must Process The Whole Of Time. This

Life and Pre Natal Cellular processing is

not enough. We have Lived Many, Many,

Many Lives. So anybody tat is not

processing the whole of time - is doing a

disservice to man and Will Not Get

Better. I cannot put it more simply.

52.

And as for me now: I just need to find

the time away from all of my writing to

go back down and DO IT so I don't walk

around with the darndest limp everytime I

come to town!

This story is greeted. with equal parts

excitement/complete CONFUSION. MRS. PURCELL slightly

nervous.

ANGLE, LATER.

MASTER and a SOCIALITE WOMAN (50s) he has her lay down on

a love seat;

What is your name?

Margaret O'Brian.

Are you sure you haven't lived here

before?

I don't know.

What's your name?

Margaret.

Are you sure?

ANGLE, PURCELL APARTMENT.

FREDDIE goes lurking around, slinks in and out of some

rooms. HE GOES INTO THE BEDROOM, STEALS SOME JEWELRY.

STUFF HIS POCKETS. (OC DIAL. PLAYS...)

ANGLE, MAIN LIVING ROOM.

MASTER has finished his demonstration and is opening it

up for questions/discussions. An OLDER MAN (MR. JOHN

MORE, 50's, scholarly, wearing a prominent HANDKERCHIEF)

stands up to speak:

(Throughout this another OLDER WOMAN has a terrible cough

from the back of the room.)

53.

Some of this seems quite like hypnosis,

is it not?

Oh no, this is funny. It's quite the

reverse. Man is hypnotized. What we do is

un-hypnotize him of the shackles. Allow

him to raise his awareness and IQ.

What is the difference between this and

psychotherapy?

Yes. Well. They are very different. No.

Psychoanalysis, they lay back. No, no,

no. Don't associate us with such people!

That's terrible (he, he) why that's a bad

manner don't you know? I mean at that

business about sex and all that. That's

for the neurotic or the person who is

insane or something like that. That's

nothing to do with us. They've failed.

That's for the fortunate few who can

afford the fees.

But some of this does in fact seem to

share quite a lot with Dr. Freud and

modern psychotherapy, does it not?

No it does not. This is an exact science,

you see. Comparable to physics or

chemistry - but simpler. It's

engineering. Herr Freud had his chance

and contributed some very workable data,

but in the end, he failed. So that's

that.

And how long does this take?

That depends. But it can be quite fast.

Quite fast. Or it can take some time.

Sometimes less than 36 hours.

36 hours? And you're saying that these

methods can cure leukemia according to

your book and what you've just said?

54.

Some forms of leukemia, 22 cases tested.

22 cases cured. Those are the results.

You can understand scepticism, can you

not?

Oh, yes, of course, yes. And this is to

be expected and welcome. For without it

we'd be positive's with no negatives -

therefore zero. charge. We must have it.

Are you a religious people?

We are not incorporated as a religion,

no. But remember this: that religion has

come uniformly from a philosophy.

Philosophy is senior to religion. You

could call us a religion of religions.

Are you saying then that any religion is

rather narrow in its outlook?

No, no, no. I have no quarrel with man's

belief's, but religions in general can be

pre-occupied with a God or Idol or

something of some such nature who is

merely trying to fill the universe with a

lot of little replicas of himself - we

are trying to free the individual - not

bend to a will of a God, you see. And if

our teachings can reconcile these views

it would be doing a great service to

Do you think it can?

I not only think it can, I know it does.

You mentioned 'good science' and what it

does.. .but doesn't that, by definition,

allow for more than one opinion?

55.

Indeed, indeed. Which is why our

gathering of day-ta is so far reaching -

Otherwise you merely have the will of one

man - which is the basis of cult, is it

not?

T'is, t'is, indeed. Thankfully we are,

all of us, working at break-neck speeds

and in unison towards catching the minds

fatal flaws and correcting it back to

it's original state of perfect - whilst

righting civilization.

I must say that I find it quite --

AND I DON'T FUCKING CARE WHAT ELSE YOU

HAVE TO SAY YOU SLIMY LITTLE PIECE OF CUM

FUCK.

YOU ARE NOTHING. AND WORTHLESS AT THAT.

YOU PUNY LITTLE NOTHING OF NOTHING. IT

WORKS IF YOU USE IT. WHO IS THIS MAN?

I can answer for myself. My name is John

More.

THIS IS NOT A DISCUSSION THIS IS A

GRILLING. A GRILL. AN ATTACK.

MRS. PURCELL

If you're not allowing some sort of

discussion regarding your beliefs -

AND I WILL NOT DEFEND MYSELF TO YOU, YOU

SLIMY PIECE OF NOTHING.

I'm sorry if you're unwilling to defend

your beliefs in any kind of rational

56.

I HAVE TAKEN MY FUCKING TIME WITH YOU AND

YOU ARE OVER NOW. YOU SLIMY PIG SHIT.

The WOMAN that's been coughing cannot stop:

STOP COUGHING. STOP COUGHING YOU HORRIBLE

OLD WOMAN. YOU DON'T GET IT. YOU DON'T

GET IT.

MRS. PURCELL is shocked, humiliated, everything

crumbles...

YOU GET OUT. GET OUT OF THIS LECTURE

HALL.

She's sick! Please! She's sick!

GET HER OUT OF THE LECTURE HALL.

This isn't a lecture hall, this is Mrs.

Purcell's home -

YOU SHUT YOUR LITTLE MOUTH. SHUT THAT

WOMAN UP. YOU WILL STOP COUGHING. THAT

GRAVELY PUTRID NOISE, YOU ARE TRYING TO

RUIN ME. YOU HAVEN'T BEEN DOING THE WORK.

YOU WOULD NOT BE SICK IF YOU DO THE WORK.

WE DON'T GET SICK.

INT. ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER

They're all leaving. Stuffed in the elevator, Master

fuming.

EXT. STREET/UPPER EAST SIDE - NIGHT

They're leaving. Master gets on his Harley and peels off

into the night. . .HOLD THE SHOT - everyone else gets into

their SEDANS. . .up ahead, MASTER WIPES OUT, lays the bike

down in the middle of Park Avenue...

57.

.he leaves it, the SEDANS pull up, he gets in. An AID

goes to the bike and picks it up.

INT. MASTER'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

MASTER is still fuming, ranting and raving, MARY SUE is

here with him...

AND THIS IS WHERE WE ARE??? AT THE LOWEST

LEVEL? TO EXPLAINNNN OURSELVES? FOR WHAT?

FOR WHAT WE'RE DOING AND WE HAVE TO

GROVEL? GROVEL LIKE A DOG, A DOG LICKING

IT'S PISS? ANOTHER DOG OF PISS I SAY.

THE ONLY WAY TO DEFEND OURSELVES IS

ATTACK. ATTACK. ATTACK. WE ATTACK THAT

MAN. IF WE DON'T DO THAT, WE WILL LOSE

EVERY BATTLE WE'RE ENGAGED IN - WE WILL

NEVER DOMINATE OUR ENVIRONMENT THE WAY WE

SHOULD UNLESS WE ATTACK.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - ADJOINING SUITE - NIGHT

WE HEAR MASTER from the next room; Everyone in here,

listens, hangs their faces.

MASTER (O.C.)

.this city is just noise. Just noise

and bad living. I know this place. I know

it's rotten secrets...

CU. FREDDIE listening. He sips some of his booze form the

FLASK, gets a real surly look on his face...

.VAL gets up and leaves the hotel room...

FRED DIE watches him go...

Everyone seems resigned, sleepy...Freddie snaps and says

You have the name's and information of

the guests at this lady's party?

Yes.

58.

FREDDIE looks at CLARK, the new son-in-law. ELIZABETH

looks up...

You're coming with me. Get up. I need

some help and you wanna make a good show,

no? Who's paying your way?

CLARK looks to Elizabeth, who gives a look that says,

"He's right."

INT. HOTEL BALLROOM / THE CAUSE H.O. - LATER

Bill White turns on the lights, takes Freddie and Clark

over to his desk. . .they get the address and info. For MR.

JOHN MORE.

I don't think this is right to do -

You don't know what we're going to do, so

don't bother thinking about this

anymore...

CAMERA with FREDDIE AND CLARK as they walk out of the

hotel and into the streets of New York --

You have any money on you?

Some.

EXT. NEW YORK STREETS / UPPER WEST SIDE - NIGHT - LATER

FREDDIE and CLARK, walking down the street... They

Where are you from, Clark?

Los Angeles. Pasadena.

What's there?

59.

I'm from there. Master and headquarters

there for a year.

.how'd you see them?

I read the first book. I worked at Boeing

for three years. When I read the book, I

didn't want to waste my time there

anymore. I came to help the Cause.

What did it say?

I'm skeptical of everything. Always have

been. All I know is I used to not be able

to sleep. Now I sleep through the night.

I spent 18 months at the Presidio with

every Army head-shrinker they had and not

one did as much for me as Book One did.

That's simple arithmetic to me. And I met

Elizabeth, so...

That's good.

He changes things. And the research is

hard to keep up with. None of this is

done by a long shot. Sometimes it's easy

to get lost.

He's a very smart man. I can tell that. I

don't understand myself but - more time

with it and I might - I feel better - I

feel like I've more to do with my life

since I met him... and I JUST met him.

So - that can't be a bad thing, right?

EXT. STREET / UPPER WEST SIDE - MOMENTS LATER

Outside an OLD APARTMENT BUILDING...

.Freddie BUZZES THE BUZZER.

60.

JOHN MORE (GROGGY) (O.C.)

Hello?

I have a delivery for Mr. More. Special.

Late night delivery. I need a signature.

JOHN MORE (O.C.)

Yes, yes, of course...

INT. APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT

JOHN MORE says to his WIFE...

Delivery... must be urgent from the

University...

He gets a robe on, makes the walk down the hallway -- He

comes to the door...

.FREDDIE smashes it down...CLARK is here and watches,

does nothing...

.FREDDIE drags him along the floor, CAMERA moves over

and sees: MRS. MORE...

.FREDDIE takes care of them both...ends up tying them

up.. .scaring them, etc. Takes some valuables -- FINDS

MORE'S LITTLE TRADEMARK HANDKERCHIEF, TAKES IT.

.Freddie gets down into his face and says;

DON'T BE SO STUPID.

They run out.

INT. VILLAGE BURLESQUE CLUB - NIGHT

Freddie drunk. Clark having his first beer..They are

watching a few very sexy BURLESQUE DANCERS. Freddie has

his eye on one in particular... she is doing a NAKED TAP

DANCE IN THE CENTER OF THE ROOM. Clark speaks;

You know... at first there were rumors

going around about you...

61.

What about me...?

Well, when you first were found on board.

People were saying you were looking for

Split Saber. That you were trying to

steal The Split Saber if it was on board.

What? Steal what?

The Split Saber.

I don't understand what you're saying.

The Split Saber.

BEAT.

I still don't understand what you're

saying...

The Darkest Cloud? AKA Dual Saber? Or The

Split Saber?

.no...

.it's what started all this. Back

then...in 1941, Master...he'd been in

operation, in army hospital. He died on

the table...gone for seven minutes...but

And in a storm of vision and creative

output from this experience he wrote The

Split Saber aka The Darkest Cloud.

Whoever read it...either went insane or

committed suicide. Twelve people read it.

Six dead, four disappeared. The last time

anyone saw it...was his last publisher in

New York.

62.

Master walked into the office to find out

what the reaction was, the publisher

called for the reader, the reader came in

with the manuscript... . threw It on the

table. . .and flung himself out of the

skyscraper window...

Master took the book and hid it where no

one could get to it...it's inside this

book: all the history. All the facts. All

too dangerous. He re-wrote it, using what

he could as the basis for what we are

able to accept and learn today.. .that's

Book One that we all study and know. . .but

the real stuff. The things at the

center...are still too dangerous. They

(kill/cure) any man who reads it. It's

passing through the jaws of resistance.

It's the truth about all this. The book

is protected and hidden. No one knows

where but Master.

The truth about all what?

Life on this planet.

.Freddie stares at him... then takes a good long look at

the BURLESQUE DANCER AND HER BREASTS. THEN BACK TO CLARK:

What is something like that worth?

He said he was once offered $25,000

dollars for it...but the price is... . how

could you figure out what the price is on

something like that? Heretofore unknown.

Incalculable by man.

Where is it?

It's locked away in a vault somewhere? I

don't know.

Where?

No one knows for sure. Some say Phoenix

or the desert outside Los Angeles.

63.

It's held back, until the time is right.

Or in case it's needed.

Needed for what?

(leverage.) ? I don't know.

How do you know about this?

Everyone knows about it. It's the

original text.

FREDDIE just sort of looks, then looks back to the NAKED

DANCER.

ANGLE, LATER.

The DANCER (ELLEN) has joined them . Ad-libbed

flirtations, innuendo, etc. CLARK watching FREDDIE...

FREDDIE gets severely drunk -- HE MAKES A DRUNKEN APPEAL

FOR HER TO COME TO THE CAUSE H.Q. For help in her life;

There's something... something that can

hepp you...you...

If you need helpp in yer life...

.where is it?

The Martinique Hotel...

Thizz helped me. It can help you.. you

can go back in time and learn thingz...

He is about to say..

(wanna fuck?)

But he PASSES OUT, FACE FIRST ON THE TABLE.

64.

INT. HOTEL/HALLWAY - NIGHT - LATER

CLARK is dragging FREDDIE down the hall, passed out...he

gets him to the room... opens the door..pulls him

inside...

FADE OUT.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

.FREDDIE wakes up. Takes him a good long time.

CAMERA just watches. He soaks everything in, thinks,

thinks, thinks. He puts the pieces together of last night

an the last few days.

INT. MASTER'S HOTEL ROOM - NEXT MORNING

START CU. ON MASTER. He looks down at something in his

hands, quietly inspects it, looks up:

FREDDIE is here, he's given him the HANDKERCHIEF. HOLD

between them, then;

What is it?

I don't think John More will be speaking

out against you again.

This isn't the way...you heard me say to

attack and you attacked?

You were right.

You were right. . .he had a wise-ass mouth.

My little Soldier.. .what did you

do?... . you need to tell me so that I

know...

65.

That's why I won't tell you. Nothing bad.

Just scared him good.

WIDEN ANGLE, THAT MOMENT.

Reveal MARY SUE is here, listening... Master looks to Mary

Sue, back to Freddie:

Whatever you've done, best not come back

to Master or the Cause.

It won't.

But-this-is-not-the-way-you-naughty-boy.

Ok? Alright. Freddie:

You-are-mischeif. Horrible young man you

are!

The PHONE RIGHTS, Mary Sue moves and picks it up, speaks

OC, we stay with MASTER and FREDDIE:

How are you...?

How do you feel to be so close to your

Auntie - just across the river? Close to

the incident of this present time?

I don't really think about all that stuff

with my Auntie, you know ...I got other

things going on besides that thing I told

you about.. .that's yesterday's news to

me, so...

Your problems aren't with your auntie or

your mommy or daddy or any such things.

You have seeded aberrations in this way.

Absolute rejection of authority and nay-

sayers.

I don't like smart-mouths. If that's what

you mean.

66.

Don't act out. This anger and battle has

been there from before you remember.

Before you know. It's not you, Freddie.

It's not...I promise you.

Freddie takes it all in.

-- what is it?

He grasps his shoulders, touches his head to Freddie.

It's just Q-44...all it is. Trillions of

years ago - little implants..

BEAT. He pulls back, smiles...

I promise to explain it. And make it go

away.

MASTER collects his notebooks.

Val has a habit of finding trouble...

I sometimes wonder what danger a man

could get himself into this Island.

Can you do this for me?

With a casualness and delicacy? Watchful

eyes to make sure trouble doesn't come...

or that come doesn't trouble? My little

soldier?

Keep an eye on him?

And report back to me...

Alright.

MASTER leaves.

67.

INT. FREDDIE'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

FREDDIE is getting into his duffle bag, re-filling the

booze supply... hiding the JEWELS he stole from last

night's party...

ELIZABETH comes to his room, from the connecting door;

she's fresh from a bath, in a robe.

Hi.

Hi.

Why aren't you downstairs?

I'm working.

What are you doing?

Errands.

You're not an errand boy...you're a

loafer... you're doing more than that, I

can tell.

BEAT. She steps up close to him.

I want to tell you...

Freddie. . .what you did for my father last

night was spectacular.

I didn't do anything.

I'm my father's daughter.

Don't tell me you did nothing. It was

just what was needed to be done. And you

took it upon yourself.

Shereaches for his face;

I can tell that you know what persecution

feels like...

68.

She KISSES him. He kisses back. Gentle and small. A

prolonged simple kiss on the lips.

Can I have some of your liquor?

No.

Why not?

It's too strong.

I'm a big girl.

Not big enough yet -

I could just steal some...

Don't argue with me. You're Father's

speaking .get dressed and get down

there...

There's plenty of time... besides:

I've heard it all before.

She backs away.. .smiles. . .and closes the door..(JUST

BEFORE IT SLAMS SHUT - her ROBE FALLS OFF, REVEALING HER

NAKED FIGURE FOR A FLEETING SECOND...)

FREDDIE. Looking at the door. FREDDIE. Hold. He takes a

LARGE SWIG OF BOOZE.

INT BANQUET HALL - MOMENTS LATER

MASTER takes the stage. THIRTY/FORTY STUDENTS applaud. He

gets up, speaks:

THANK YOU! THANK YOU! Well? Down but not

out. Not Dead Yet!

(no tombstone at least...) he he he he.

69.

We are going to focus this morning to

"Communication" to cover "any exchange

between ourselves and our environment."

Because that's what I want to talk to you

about today: dominating your environment.

INT. STAIRWELL. EVENING/LATER

CAMERA looks up the spiral stairwell of the HOTEL. It's

the end of the evening/lectures... . WE SEE: VAL walking

down the steps ... . moments later, about three floors

above, FREDDIE pokes his head over, sees VAL and starts

to follow... . MUSIC STARTS.

INT. LOBBY OF THE HOTEL. THAT MOMENT

VAL moves past FOLLOWERS who are wrapping up for the

evening, discussing, smoking cigs, exchanging ideas,

etc...and out into the NEW YORK CITY STREETS.

FREDDIE follows ... MINI-SEQUENCE...

EXT./INT. COFFEE SHOP. VILLAGE. NIGHT

VAL walks into a coffee shop, takes a seat in a booth and

orders some coffee...

FREDDIE stands across the street and watches VAL.

FREDDIE buys hot dog from a hot-dog vendor... stands and

waits.. .and watches VAL sit alone...

After a few minutes ... FREDDIE sees something:

A YOUNG GROUP ENTERS THE COFFEE SHOP. It's BILL WHITE,

his girlfriend PEGGY and TWO MALE NEW YORK FOLLOWERS: JIM

LEHR AND FRED FRITZ. They're here to meet VAL. They join

him, sit down, speak. Order cokes, coffee, smoke cigs,

etc...

FREDDIE watching all this from across the street. VAL is

answering their questions, speaking with some authority

about something, etc. etc.

70.

.FREDDIE sizes up the situation

And what this meeting might mean...

He turns this all around in his head for a while.. .and

after enough of it, gets restless...

.He moves to a phone booth. Makes a call. He hears a

young male voice say "HELLO? HELLO?"

Bobby?

Yeah?

It's Freddie.

FREDDIE! FREDDIE WHERE ARE YA!

Are you home?

YEAH. YOU HERE?!

I'm comin' over -

He hangs up.

He looks back across the street at the group in the

coffee shop. And WALKS AWAY, OFF DOWN THE STREET...

INT. BOB'S APARTMENT - WEST VILLAGE

inside. . .BOB is having a party with a bunch of his

FRIENDS, who all look alike and drink beer, etc;

Where's everybody?

71.

We're havin' a party. Where you coming

They greet each other and go inside.

INT. APARTMENT/ROOM - LATER

BOB introduces FREDDIE: "my cousin, Freddie" to all the

boys.

All the BOYS are around, watching the TWO GIRLS DANCE and

Striesand.

FREDDIE looks at family photos that are out and on the

walls.

Where's my mom?

I heard she was in Florida.

Where's your mom?

Left. She's back living in Princeton.

It's the best since she's gone. My dad's

never here. This place is mine. Did you

see these girls?

ANGLE, LATER. FREDDIE and the BOYS.

FREDDIE pours a tiny bit of his booze into the beers for

them...

Anybody ever hear about stolen jewels and

money in the sewers?

Where?

72.

Near Harlem.

They shake their heads.

FREDDIE .(CONT'D)

I heard about a load of money and jewels

that are hidden in a sewer wall up near

Harlem. A long time ago.

With crocodiles that live down there and

protect it.

I heard about that.

I heard about that too.

Anybody want to go look for it?

EXT. HARLEM. NIGHT

The FIVE BOYS, including FREDDIE and BOB get out of an

OLD CAR... . they Find and lift a MANHOLE cover and head

They come to an intersection -

Let's go this way and that way - come

BOB follows FREDDIE, the rest go the other way -

VARIOUS ANGLES watching them move around, etc.

ANGLE, THE WALL.

CAMERA MOVES ALONG THE WALLS OF THE SEWERS.

FREDDIE looking for something...

73.

.THE WALL...

.FREDDIE...

BOB AND FREDDIE walking/talking:

My mom signed my early entrance to the

army.

How'd she do that?

She just signed this letter I made up

saying my birth certificate was burned in

a fire. She's happy to let me go.

You don't want to go there, dummy.

There's a lot of pussy there, Freddie. I

like those Korean girls the way they

look.

You're an idiot.

I'd rather be there than here. Pussy over

there... I've been licking so much pussy

this summer...

They keep walking. BOB is drunk. He turns, says to

I jerked off to a picture of my mom once.

Did I ever tell you that?

No.

I did...

Bob smiles, giggles... stumbles forward...walks...Freddie

watching him...

ANGLE, THE OTHERS.

Walking and looking, drunk, smoking, etc. They find an

area that they think may have something - and start

WHACKING AWAY WITH THE SLEDGEHAMMER...

Holy shit.

75.

EXT. STREET

They all climb up and out of the sewer - cheering and

celebrating.

INT. BOB'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT

BOB and the other BOYS passed out on couches and floor.

FREDDIE is awake, looking around at some photos and

things...

FREDDIE leaves him the JEWELS, takes a couple family

photos with him and writes a note that says:

"I'VE GONE TO AFRICA,

SEE YOU AGAIN SOMETIME.

FREDDIE."

and leaves.

INT. HOTEL ROOM. DAWN

FREDDIE comes up to his room and hears from the hallway:

TYPING. He opens up and comes in. MASTER is here, in his

underwear, typing away. Very fast. He barely takes notice

of Freddie, keeps typing.

FREDDIE gets into the bed. MASTER stops for one moment,

looks at him, sees his condition, goes back to typing...

HELEN SULLIVAN (OC)

This city can be cold

and unforgiving to new

ideas. Philadelphia is the city of

brotherly love. We've had miraculous

results with the textbooks

and lecture tapes.

INT. MASTER'S HOTEL ROOM/MARTINIQUE HOTEL - LATER MORNING

CU. HELEN SULLIVAN (sweet woman, early 30s) IS SPEAKING.

76.

If you come, we can guarantee an audience

of one hundred people three nights a week

and six afternoons a week.

We have an engineer from Western Electric

who is willing to record all of the

lectures for free onto high fidelity

audio tapes.

Perhaps these can be used for sale.

I assure you, you will find a very open

city. People with open minds... we keep

the bad ones out. I know that new

sciences can attract quacks and some

strange people, but keep them all away..

MASTER and MARY SUE listening to Helen. NORMAN CONRAD

stands to the side...

You are very right about one thing,

Helen: this is a dirty city of nothing

good.

MASTER thinks ... . Everyone looks around at each

other ...A WOMAN STARTS SINGING...

"A TISKET-A-TASKET-MY PAST LIVES IN A

BASKET.

I WENT DOWN THE WHOLE-TIME-HOLE AND FOUND

I'D DROPPED MY BASKET..."

PRE-LAP THE SINGING OVER THE FOLLOWING:

EXT. HOTEL/NEW YORK CITY - MORNING

Everyone is GETTING INTO CARS.. .the whole ENTOURAGE.

FREDDIE at the center of it. MASTER comes out of the

hotel quickly and into the sedan that waits...

BILL WHITE is there to say good-bye and is all but

ignored by MASTER and MARY SUE...

The swirl of getting bags, kids and bodies into SEDANS...

77.

VAL gets in one car...FREDDIE gets behind the wheel of

another... and they DRIVE OFF...

INT. CAR - MOVING - DAY

FREDDIE is driving. MASTER is asleep in the passenger

seat. MARY SUE is breast feeding in the back. She looks

at FREDDIE in the rear view;

You see anything last night?

.with what?

With Val.

CU. FREDDIE

Considers this a moment.

No.

How does that happen?

.lost 'em in the streets...

. or maybe you drink too much and you

get cross-eyed.

EXT. SUBURBAN PHILADELPHIA/CAUSE COLLEGE - NIGHT

A party is in progress at HELEN SULLIVAN'S HOME which has

been converted into a STUDY COLLEGE. It's beautiful,

large, well-appointed home.

A woman: JOAN BANKS is singing, ELIZABETH is playing

piano. Everyone is here for a welcoming party, good time,

cocktails, snacks, etc...

I DROPPED IT, I DROPPED IT, I BETTER GO

AND FIND IT.

78.

JOAN (SINGING) (CONT-D)

SOMETHING HURTS AND DON'T NEED THOSE

JERKS TO TELL US WHAT TO DO-O -

WE'RE HERE NOW, WE'RE HERE NOW.

IN LOVELY PHIL-E-DELFI. AND

WRESTLE OUR RE-ACTS RIGHT TO THE

GROUND AND PUSH, PULL, PIN IT DOWN.

WE'LL TAKE IT, WE'LL TAKE IT,

THOSE DIRTY SEEDS AND WIPE 'EM.

THE APA AND AMA WILL HAVE TO KISS OUR -

SS'S..

Everyone applauds, laughs. MASTER is smitten, STANDING

OVATION. MASTER walks over to JOAN to shake her hand...

She whispers to him:

What do you do with a student who keeps

dreaming she is in bed with you?

Get thee behind me --

And push.

They disperse. PIANO STARTS IN AGAIN...

Everyone is relaxed, sitting around. New faces (JOAN and

HELEN) sit close to MASTER...

A WOMAN is speaking (stories of Cause success she's had

at her branch in Minneapolis)

.a once-a-month meeting... this last

Saturday night we had a chiropractor..and

he spoke about 'Handwriting Analysis'...

MASTER is distracted... as he listens: HE RUBS HIS NOSE

AND PULLS HIS EAR, CATCHING FREDDIE'S EYE. As we hear the

woman ramble on, FREDDIE gets his FLASK, moves discreetly

to get a glass, make a drink and brings it to MASTER.

This is unnoticed by everyone but MARY SUE. The WOMAN

Cheers to that!

Everyone raises their glasses and DRINKS. MASTER downs

his new drink. A calm... then Master gently protificates:

79.

Something that Joseph Smith had right:

the breeding and the development of the

group... doubled, tripled with certain. ..a

certain marital structure... how clever.

Something to look at deeply for a

growth...

MARY SUE looks at him. JOAN looks at him. HELEN looks at

him. FREDDIE looks at all of it. Helen's husband John

looks confused.

.the consideration of Celestial

Marriage. Spiritual Wifery. Plural

Unions. These cannot be overlooked so

quickly... think of the speed at which a

movement could grow...

BEAT. Met with a strange silence. MARY SUE moves to get

up. . .MASTER changes the topic slightly...

To live in the days of six-shooters and

open frontier, that's what I'd like! My

grandfather. Rancher. Wyoming. A criminal

of the highest lineage, once told me he

met a boy named Buckskin Joe...

He keeps talking...

INT. MASTER'S ROOM/HELEN'S HOUSE - MORNING

It's the next morning. MASTER is getting ready, dressing

in the bathroom, getting ready for his lectures... MARY

SUE comes in, from behind him... she hugs him from

behind.. .he smiles.. .she looks at him in the mirror, he

looks at her ... . she REACHES AROUND, GETS INTO HIS PANTS

AND STARTS TO JERK HIM OFF, LOOKING STRAIGHT AT HIM IN

THE EYE AS SHE SAYS:

You can do. Whatever you want. As long as

I don't find out. And as long. As. Anyone

I know. Doesn't know. Other than that.

You stop this idea. And you put it back

in its pants. It didn't work for them.

And it's not gonna work for you. We.

Have. Enough problems. Cum for me.

80.

Yes. Yes.

Do it. And get your best behavior out...

cum for me...

Yes, master.

And no more of that boy's booze.

Yes master.

He comes, collapses, sinks to the floor. She washes her

hands and walks out of the bathroom.

EXT. SUBURBAN PHILADELPHIA/CAUSE COLLEGE - DAY

A beautiful spring day. STUDENTS, FOLLOWERS, COME IN,

SIGN IN...

IN THE MAIN LIVING ROOM, on stage, MASTER is working with

a WOMAN, processing her. She lays back on a couch set

up...FULL CROWD of students watching...

Try to recall how you feel...

Oh, I'm sort of glad it's the end..

What happens next?

The doctor puts a stethoscope to her

chest..

What is the doctor wearing?

A white coat.

Is there a smell in the room?.

81.

It smells like a hospital.

Try to imagine what a hospital smells

like.

Uugh. Uugh. Alright.

What does the doctor say?

He listens to her chest and says, "She's

gone."

FREDDIE and VAL are sitting in the front foyer of the

house, facing each other in two folding chairs...we see

the. STAGE IN THE B.G...

.VAL is bored and nodding off to sleep ...FREDDIE

watches VAL. FREDDIE kicks his chair --

Wake up. Your Father's speaking.. .you

could learn something.

What's that?

You heard me.

He's making this up as he goes, don'tcha

know..? You can sleep and wake up and not

have missed anything...

Maybe you should pay more attention.

You have something to say to me?

I'm curly-q. Round in circles. So shut

up.

.FREDDIE takes a nice big drink from his FLASK...

FREDDIE looks out the open front door: TWO POLICEMAN AND

A MARSHALL are parking their cars and walking towards the

house...

82.

FREDDIE.

Watching them advance... He hesitates. He's not sure what

to do. So he stays put...

The MEN walk up to the house ...FREDDIE and VAL look:

We're looking for Lancaster Dodd.

I don't know who that is...

May we come in?

No. You cannot.

Yes you can. He's up there -

VAL points to the stage...

That's him.

You can't come in. Get outta here.

MASTER, ON STAGE, looks out - AGAINST THE GLARE OF THE

DOOR, he can recognize the FIGURES AS UNIFORMED...

ANGLE, AT THE DOOR.

We have a civil warrant to serve to

Lancaster Dodd to appear in Philadelphia

Bankruptcy Court - an arrest warrant -

Stay out of their way, Freddie.

MASTER walks down to see what's happening.

What is happening here?

Are you Lancaster Dodd?

Yes I Am.

83.

We have an arrest warrant for you, sir...

What are the charges?

By order of Pennsylvania District Court

by the Mildred Purcell Foundation for

wrongful withdraw of funds. And operating

a medical school without a license.

That's.what we'll have to take you in for

This is a silly joke, no?

No, sir it isn't. But we have to take you

in and book and fingerprint you.

This is comic opera. Is it illegal in

this city to get better?

Please put your hands behind your back.

I have no disagreement with you boys

doing your work in all its silliness as

defenders of what code? What honor? What

part of the galaxy? This is a scientific

gathering - you will cuff me from the

front, if you please --

He raises his ARMS for HANDCUFFS. FOLLOWERS COME FORWARD

AND START TO PROTEST ABOUT THIS. ONE YOUNG MAN, WITH ONE

ARM AND A HOOK FOR A HAND STARTS SWINGING IT AROUND (WWII

FREDDIE gets into it and is pushed by a POLICEMAN which

unleashes a WRATH IN HIM. IT VERY QUICKLY BECOMES A MINI-

MELE.

FREDDIE IS SLAMMED TO THE GROUND AND WRESTLED WITH BY THE

TWO MARSHALS. HE FIGHTS BACK. IT'S VERY ROUGH AND

VIOLENT.

MASTER, FREDDIE are taken away in hand cuffs. MARY SUE

comes out, angry at the police, everyone is, etc. Quite a

scene.

84.

MASTER is actually trying to CALM FREDDIE DOWN, WHO IS

GOING NUTS IN THE HANDCUFFS AND AT HIS TREATMENT

Freddie, no, no, no, calm down, please,

please. It's nothing, just laugh, we'll

be out shortly, it's nothing. I, please,

pleasue, Freddie -

INT. POLICE CAR

THEY SHOVE FREDDIE INTO THE CAR AND HE GOES CRAZY.

SMASHING HIS HEAD AGAINST THE WINDOW, THE BACK SEAT, ETC.

HE YELLS LIKE AN ANIMAL. KICKS AND SCREAMS, BLEEDING FROM

HIS FOREHEAD.

MASTER is put into another car.

INT. POLICE STATION - LATER

They arrive in CARS. FREDDIE in one.car. MASTER in the

other.

FREDDIE is STILL FIGHTING. THEY DRAG HIM. MASTER is

speaking to him, trying to calm him down...

INT. HOLDING CELL - LATER

It's hours later. FREDDIE is out of energy. MASTER sits

with him. Old-fashioned holding cell.

MASTER holds his FINGER TO HIS LIPS.

Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.

He gets up close to FREDDIE, whispers in his ear;

Whatever we say is undoubtably being

monitored...speak in whispers.

I don't want to talk to you right now.

This is FBI work, Russians

maybe... this... too much work for the

AMA...

85.

Stop talking...

You're fear of capture and imprisonment

is an implant from millions of years ago.

An Invader Force played games with your

spirit as it.moved from one body to the

next - free for a moment - it was free

and the invader force captured it - spun

you around in a device not unlike a

grinder and hit you with waves of high

wattage electrical impulses - quaver

bolts to damage you. The impulse lodges

and plants the push-pull instinct, dumped

in scalding hot water, then freezing cold

- a control mechanism - any legal action,

a summons to court, the sight of a police

officer, exposes a glandular reaction and

anxiety wave of the highest order,

the mere threat of arrest will make a

psychotic breakdown. This happened to you

and you are free to stop it. Their game

and implants are no match for you. Laugh

in their face. Laugh at it. These

triggers are useless now. You created

THEM so YOU can DESTROY THEM.

MASTER pulls away ... FREDDIE looks at him. HOLD.

Horseshit.

I don't have any opinions. I'm giving you

facts.

Just shut-your-mouth? You're a fucking

DRUNK.

ME shut my mouth? You're a fucking DRUNK.

You CACTUS. Play a game with me?

I don't think so, you little yo-yo. That

ain't the way. You want to shut me up?

I'm the best and only friend you have,

shut me up from saving you? HELPING YOU.

ONLY WAY. FIND ANOTHER ONE, YO-YO. You

wanna get rid of this or live this way or

MASTER it?

86.

You listen - you wanna spit in that cops

face for touching you? I'm gonna beat him

with you. Bash his skull in. BUT DON'T

TURN ON ME, DRUNK.

Long silence. They sit in it.

Helen's house...all those girls walking

around, the wives of ... . I want to fuck

all of them.

Sex is not an aberration. Never has been.

So what's wrong?

I want to fuck 'em all. I want to stick

it in every one of them.

When did you forget that surviving was

what you're supposed to do. Stick it in.

Stick it in.

I don't belong in here, man. I gotta get

out of here...

You belong at sea.

.hmph...

.You belong to Doris.

Why're you talking about her?

You think of Doris. The loss of her.

Triggers millions of little shocks and.

charges, doesn't it? That present-life

loss.

It was Val who let them in the house and

told them who you were... Val did it.

87.

INT. FREDDIE/VAL'S ROOM - HELEN'S HOUSE - LATER

MASTER enters the room, Freddie behind him...VAL'S BED IS

MADE AND ALL HIS BELONGING ARE GONE...FREDDIE looks at

the mirror on the wall. WRITTEN IN LIPSTICK a note to

"YOU'LL NEVER GET BETTER"

MOMENTS LATER. SAME.

MARY SUE is here, looking at it. She says to Master:

Where's he going? What's he doing?

MASTER sits on the bed, thinks.

She leaves quickly, we hear her go down the hall and

knock on ELIZABETH's door... ELIZABETH answers and the

speak ...FREDDIE and MASTER look at each other;

His mother was a paranoid schizophrenic

who wanted to abort him. Right now he

'wants to be sick.' He's losing his war.

EXT. HELEN'S HOUSE/UPPER HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

FREDDIE is sitting outside the CLOSED DOOR to MASTER'S

UPSTAIRS BEDROOM/OFFICE. We HEAR VOICES talking

CLARK walks up and sits with FREDDIE, they sit in

silence... trying to listen, but not hearing...

He's done this before...

What happened?

He ran out of money and came back. He's a

squirrel.

He's trying to get to The Split Saber,

don't you think?

To sell it. Sell it off to any of these

88.

The door ... NORMAN CONRAD asks FREDDIE to come in...

INT. OFFICE - THAT MOMENT

FREDDIE enters, sits down.. .DOOR CLOSES. They all face

him, sit him in a chair... MASTER, ELIZABETH, NORMAN, MARY

SUE...

There is a mission against time to be

undertaken, Freddie.

Are you prepared to travel wherever we

may ask you to go -- ?

Yes.

-- An assignment of importance in which

more than just life hangs in the balance.

-- I want to know if you can stop your

boozing?

Can you stop drinking?

-- The drinking blocks the physical pain

and dissolves treatment from working,

Let me be unambiguous: Tell me you won't

drink.

ZOOM IN TOWARDS HIS FACE, ENDS IN CU.

I won't drink.

Your mission is to go to Phoenix, Arizona

to prepare for a Universal Process

Congress of the Cause.

89.

MARY SUE (CONT'D)

All branches brought together for a

summit ... your mission is to prepare for

MOC's arrival and provide security at his

home in Camel Foot Hills...

.By bringing everyone together with the

promise of unveiling new levels ... there

will be interest from outside

agencies ... the new works are of great

many interests to dark forces...

Who?

CIA, Russians, Catholic Church. The list

is long, Freddie.

We don't expect trouble, but if it

comes... we believe and trust that you are

the right man for this mission.

You're the only one that can do this,

Freddie.

.What is Val doing in all this?

He's a squirrel. And he has weaknesses.

Do you believe that no man can be neutral

in the struggle between civilization and

chaos?

Yes.

Val's not a threat to you. You can handle

Val. Can't you?

INT. KITCHEN - DAWN

FREDDIE and MASTER getting ready to leave. Just the two

Freddie... there's something else...a side

project I have for you...

.When you get there...I need you to get

something for me ... something of great

importance to me.

When you arrive at the house ...

you go underneath the house. There's a

crawl space. In the center of the house

is a small hole. You will see broken soil

that marks the spot.. .dig it up.

Inside is a box. I need you to take the

box and protect it. You can take it to

the First Phoenix Bank and register a

safe deposit. There it can stay until my

arrival...

What is it?

Valuables. Personal and confidential to

me ...

As Guardian of the Good for this

civilization and all it's neighboring

galaxies ... . can you promise me that you

will safely deliver and protect this box?

Yeah.

FREDDIE looks at her. She looks at him

INT. AIRPLAIN - EN ROUTE - NIGHT

FREDDIE is on board. A STEWARDESS comes down the aisle,

asks if anyone wants a COCKTAIL.

FREDDIE says no thank you. The MAN next to him has a nice

GIN AND TONIC.

FREDDIE is starting to sweat, gently shakes as he begins

to de-tox...

EXT. PHOENIX AIRPORT - TARMAC - DAY

FREDDIE gets off the plane, walks to the terminal - he

carries a DUFFLE BAG. Walking swiftly, purposefully...

EXT. SUBURBAN PHOENIX - AFTERNOON

FREDDIE is in A CAB that pulls into a SUBURBAN PHOENIX

NEIGHBORHOOD. He gets out in front of RANCH STYLE HOME

separated a bit form the rest of the neighborhood ... THE

CAB WAITS.

HE WALKS UP TO THE HOUSE, TAKES OUT THE KEY...HE PUTS THE

KEY IN AND STEPS INSIDE. HE LOOKS AND SEES:

THE HOUSE HAS BEEN TURNED UPSIDE DOWN AND RANSACKED.

Freddie is shocked/nervous ... . suddenly on guard.

FREDDIE walks around, looks into what appears to have

been MASTER'S OFFICE... Writing, books, etc, thrown all

over the place...

92.

HOLE'S IN THE WALLS, SOCKETS RIPPED OUT, FLOOR BOARDS

RIPPED UP...

EXT. PHOENIX HOUSE - THAT MOMENT

UNDER THE HOUSE. A CRAWL SPACE. FREDDIE crawls on his

belly underneath the house - goes to the center of it and

finds a HOLE. He digs into it...and digs up A BOX

BOX SIZE) COVERED IN DUST. HE TAKES THE BOX OUT AND

CRAWLS AWAY.

HE PUTS THE BOX INTO HIS DUFFLE BAG. HE BRUSHES THE DUST

OFF. HE GOES BACK TO THE CAB AND GETS IN --

EXT. DOWNTOWN PHOENIX / THE CAUSE H.O. - DUSK

FREDDIE pulls up in the cab to THE CAUSE H.Q. STOREFRONT

OPERATION in downtown PHOENIX. He walks in...DICK BRETON

(30s, Phoenix Branch Manager) is here - a few others.

Good morning.

Are you Dick Breton? I'm Freddie Sutton.

You're expecting me...

FREDDIE is very friendly, but focused on the task, he

asks to use the phone to call Master - some place

private, perhaps...

INT. BACK OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

FREDDIE is alone, on the phone, with MASTER.

Freddie.

Someone broke into the house.

.Someone broke into the house...

93.

Someone's been there. I don't know when.

I may have just missed them - the front

door was locked, I went in with the key

and the house up ended, all smashed up on

the ground - I walked to the back - the

door was open -

-- do you have the box?

Yes.

Where are you now?

I'm at the office with Dick Breton.

Is he there with you?

He's outside. The door's closed.

The box is safe in your hands?

Yes. It was right where you said it would

be...I haven't opened it.

You've done well. You know the severity

of what you hold in your hands -

Is...did...did Val break into the house

looking for it?

Possibly. A crazed lone lunatic for all

we know. Certain atomic agencies wouldn't

mind a crack at it, I'm sure.

What should I do now?

Get yourself a room at the Sun Inn Motel.

The Sun Inn Motel ...it's

nearby... acceptable accommodations.

Find yourself a room there... and guard it

until morning - stay safe until that bank

opens...

It's good. I got it.

Yes it is. Are you alright?

Yeah, yeah. I'm alright. I'm shaking..

Why?

I don't know. It's hot down here.

You feel any stomach pain?

No.

Ringing in your ears?

No.

Left side feels good?

Yeah.

Right side feel good?

I'm alright.

Good, good. Alright, soldier. Go to it.

UP.

He turns off the light, smokes in the dark. ZOOM TOWARDS

THE BAG...ZOOM TOWARDS FREDDIE. STRETCCCCCCHHHH OUT THIS

MOMENT.

(IMAGINES HIMSELF OPENING THE BOX AND FIRE COMING OUT OF

THE BOX AND TEARING UP HIS ARM AND COVERING HIS HEAD.

THEN BLOWING HIS HEAD OFF)

BACK TO REALITY. HE TAKES THE BOX OUT OF THE DUFFLE BAG

AND LEAVES IT ON THE BED.

FREDDIE is starting to sweat and shake a bit. He's de-

toxing.

He looks down at his feet: HE HAS A TATTOO of a PIG on

his right foot and a ROOSTER on his left...

HE LOOKS AT THESE TATTOO'S...

HE SPENDS SOME TIME IN THE TOILET THROWING UP.

This goes on...until...

HE LOOKS UP, ACROSS ROOFTOPS, SEES A FIGURE RUNNING AWAY,

JUMPING ACROSS ROOFTOPS...

FREDDIE makes his way down into the lobby of the

held June 5th to 9th...

Everyone is excited.

You don't have to change you faith or

leave the congregation you belong to...So

those interested in freedom are urged to

please come for free sample processing

sessions in being 'younger' feeling

'freer' and understanding where you come

from...

If every individual in the world had one

other individual to whom he could go with

his troubles and his ideas; and if he

could tell that Other all about his

troubles and ideas; and if that Other

would listen AND understand, but not

evaluate or invalidate or approve or give

advice or in any other way try to control

the thoughts of the speaker; the people

of the world would become sane, well and

happy.

from inside the house - Master at work)

.a CAR PULLS up...across the street. . .he watches it

park... . and out steps: BILL WHITE (from New York)

.he closes the door... and walks across the

street... towards the house ... . he Looks very out of place

in the middle of the desert. . .he approaches Freddie:

Hello, Freddie.

Bill.

Just dropped in to see Master, find out

what's going on - guess I lost my

invitation.

There's nothing going on, Bill.

What does that mean?

That's what that means.

Does that mean I'm out? Am I in? What

does that mean?

That's it.

102.

Y'know that I've had no communications

from this office for six weeks - no

Journals, no answer's to my calls, I

wrote a letter, was it received?

Yes.

I'm mixed up slightly here. You know,

when I worked for the Cause, I was made a

nearly $800 in salary due me.

We appreciate that.

And as a Founding Member, I'm supposed to

be a member for life?

Yes.

And that entitles me to the Journals?

Yes.

But I haven't gotten the Journals?

No.

And I'm not going to get the Journals?

No.

And do you know that I'm a Fellow of the

Cause and as a Fellow of the Cause I'm a

member for life?

Yes.

But I haven't gotten the Journals?

103.

No.

And do you know that I paid $800 for the

Minister's Course and that entitles me to

membership in the Group until January 1?

And as a member I'm supposed to get the

journals?

And I'm not going to get any Journals?

No.

Ok. Do you know that I paid $50 for my

"Doctor Of Divinity" certificate, and for

which I also was to receive a medallion,

a ribbon, a lapel pin, and a gold

bordered book of The Cause?

Yes.

And I haven't gotten them?

No.

But you're going to give them to me?

No.

Then I suppose you're going to refund my

money?

No.

104.

Why?

You're a dissenter. And an unfaithful

woman.

BEAT.

BILL.

Aren't you ashamed of yourself, sitting

there getting all red in the face and

being embarrassed because you have to act

like a heel?

I'm not embarrassed. That's sunburn.

I'm not going to let anyone tell me I

can't have what I paid for, except

Master. I want to see Master.

You can't see Master.

Why?

Because he's busy and I'm not going to

let you.

Oh...it's Freddie-Barrier now? Why don't

you hyphenate that?

PAUSE.

You know what this all is? Huh? It's

mental cruelty. That's what it is. It's

just mental cruelty to invent all these

new ideas and never follow through on it

and just keep adding and subtracting and

I gotta pay for this and that level and

more and more-and Book II's coming. All

the answers..."if you had that, it's no

good 'cause here's the new thing.. .and

oh no...you don't need that.. .that's

old.. .this is new." And it's more and

more and it's all just cruel.

105.

And it's all gettin' away form what it

was at the start which made sense. This

is screwed man. Screw this. And screw

you.

BILL leaves.

FREDDIE watches him go. Something takes hold of him.

.FREDDIE walks after BILL, behind his back, come up on

him and CRACKS HIM IN THE KIDNEYS. HE GOES DOWN...KICKS

HIM FOR GOOD MEASURE, THEN WALKS BACK TO THE PORCH...

He sits down and just watches Bill squirm in the middle

of the street, finally dragging himself up and into his

car.

PAUSE.

Do you need some photographs taken? I

could do that for you.

You know. Whatever I do for you, I'm only

gonna do for a minute. It's only gonna be

a minute before I go somewhere else

is something to do for billions of years

or not at all...

We don't need any photo's taken, Freddie.

in my arms ever more.

Leave all your lovers,

weepin' on a far-away shore.

Out on the briny
