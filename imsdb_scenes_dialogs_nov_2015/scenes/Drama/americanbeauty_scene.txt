INT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

On VIDEO: JANE BURNHAM lays in bed, wearing a tank top. She's

sixteen, with dark, intense eyes.

Her mind wanders for a beat.

Jane looks at us and sits up.

EXT. ROBIN HOOD TRAIL - EARLY MORNING

We're FLYING above suburban America, DESCENDING SLOWLY toward

a tree-lined street.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

We're looking down at a king-sized BED from OVERHEAD:

LESTER BURNHAM lies sleeping amidst expensive bed linens,

face down, wearing PAJAMAS. An irritating ALARM CLOCK RINGS.

Lester gropes blindly to shut it off.

CONTINUED:

He sits up and puts on his slippers.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - MASTER BATH - MOMENTS LATER

Lester thrusts his face directly into a steaming hot shower.

ANGLE from outside the shower: Lester's naked body is

silhouetted through the fogged-up glass door. It becomes

apparent he is masturbating.

EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

CLOSE on a single, dewy AMERICAN BEAUTY ROSE. A gloved hand

with CLIPPERS appears and SNIPS the flower off.

CAROLYN BURNHAM tends her rose bushes in front of the Burnham

house. A very well-put together woman of forty, she wears

color-coordinated gardening togs and has lots of useful and

expensive tools.

Lester watches her through a WINDOW on the first floor,

peeping out through the drapes.

EXT. JIMS' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

In the fenced front yard of the house next door, a dog BARKS

repeatedly. A MAN in a conservative suit (JIM #1) chastises

the barking dog.

A second MAN in a conservative suit (JIM #2) comes out of the

house.

CONTINUED:

EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Lester watches all this from the window.

Jim #1 walks toward the fence to greet Carolyn.

Jim #1 and Carolyn continue to chat, unaware that Lester is

watching them.

Lester's POV: We can't hear what Jim and Carolyn are saying,

but she's overly animated, like a TV talk show host.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - JANE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

JANE is seated at her desk, working at her computer.

CLOSE on the COMPUTER MONITOR: A PERSONAL BANKING SOFTWARE

window suddenly disappears to reveal another window: a

PLASTIC SURGERY WEBSITE, featuring clinical "before" and

"after" photos of surgically augmented breasts.

Outside, a CAR HORN BLARES. Jane stuffs items into her

BACKPACK.

We HEAR the CAR HORN again from outside. Jane studies herself

in a mirror, then shifts to get a good profile of her

breasts.

EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Carolyn stands next to a platinum-colored MERCEDES-BENZ

ML320, reaching in through the drivers' window to blow the

HORN again.

Jane shuffles out of the house, her backpack slung over her

shoulder.

Jane gets in the car. Lester hurries out the front door,

carrying a BRIEFCASE.

CONTINUED:

Lester's briefcase suddenly springs open and his papers spill

all over the driveway. He drops to his knees to gather

everything.

Lester smiles sheepishly, trying to lighten the moment.

His POV: Carolyn looks down at us, contemptuous but also

bored, as if she gave up expecting anything more long ago.

INT. MERCEDES-BENZ ML320 - A SHORT TIME LATER

Carolyn is driving; Jane stares out the window. Lester is

asleep in the back seat.

INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

Lester sits at his workstation, a BEIGE CUBICLE surrounded by

IDENTICAL BEIGE CUBICLES. He's staring at a computer monitor

and talking on a HEADSET PHONE. The beleaguered expression on

his face is at odds with the light, friendly tone of his

voice.

CONTINUED:

BRAD, a dapper man in his thirties, approaches and observes

Lester, who is unaware of his presence.

Lester disconnects the call, obviously irritated.

Lester turns around, smiling perfunctorily

INT. BRAD'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Brad is seated behind his desk in his big corner office.

Lester sits across from him, looking small and isolated.

Brad stands, ready to usher Lester out.

CONTINUED:

Lester stares at him, powerless.

EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

A MOVING VAN is parked in front of the COLONIAL HOUSE next

door to the Burnhams'. Movers carry furniture toward the

house.

The Mercedes-Benz pulls into the Burnham driveway. Carolyn

drives, Lester is in the passenger seat.

CONTINUED:

As they get out of the car, Carolyn scopes out the MOVERS

next door.

She heads into the house, followed by Lester.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - DINING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

We HEAR EASY-LISTENING MUSIC.

Lester, Carolyn and Jane are eating dinner by CANDLELIGHT.

RED ROSES are bunched in a vase at the center of the table.

Nobody makes eye contact, or even seems aware of anybody

else's presence, until...

A long beat. Lester suddenly turns to Jane.

CONTINUED:

A beat.

Now she looks at him as if he's lost his mind.

Carolyn is watching this closely.

She gets up and heads toward the kitchen.

She's gone. Lester notices Carolyn looking at him critically.

CONTINUED: (2)

Lester is quiet, staring at his plate.

Lester gets up and starts after Jane, taking his plate with

him.

Carolyn watches him go, irritated.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Jane stands at the sink, rinsing off her plate. Lester

enters.

Jane turns and stares at him, waiting for him to finish.

He's looking to her for a little help here, but she's too

uncomfortable with this sudden intimacy to give him any.

EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

On VIDEO: We're looking through GREENHOUSE WINDOWS at Lester

and Jane in the kitchen We can't hear what they're saying,

but it's obvious it's not going well.

CONTINUED:

Jane puts her plate in the dishwasher and leaves. We FOLLOW

HER out the door, then the camera JERKS back to Lester

calling after her.

CLOSE on the face of   RICKY FITTS, illuminated by the screen

of his DIGICAM as he   videotapes. Ricky is eighteen, but his

eyes are much older.   Beneath his Zen-like tranquility lurks

something wounded...   and dangerous.

His POV, on VIDEO: Through the kitchen window, we see Lester

at the sink, rinsing off his plate, muttering to himself. His

head suddenly jerks up and he looks at us, as if he realizes

he's being watched.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Lester's POV: We're looking out through the kitchen window at

the point where Ricky was just standing, but he's no longer

there.

Lester turns off the faucet, dries his hands, then tosses the

towel on the counter on his way out, where it lands next to a

framed PHOTOGRAPH of Lester, Carolyn, and a much-younger

Jane, taken several years earlier at an amusement park.

It's startling how happy they look.

EXT. SALE HOUSE - DAY

CLOSE on a wooden SIGN that reads:

OPEN HOUSE TODAY

BURNHAM & ASSOCIATES REALTY

555-0195 Carolyn Burnham

The sign is planted in front of a RUN-DOWN HOME in a   run-down

neighborhood. The Mercedes is parked in front of the   house.

Carolyn, wearing a smart business suit, is unloading   a box of

cleaning supplies and a BOOMBOX from the back of the   Mercedes

when something across the street catches her eye.

Her POV: In front of a different house with much more curb

appeal is another SIGN, featuring a picture of a handsome

silver-haired MAN. It reads:

Another One SOLD By Buddy Kane

The Real Estate King 555-0100

Carolyn frowns and slams the back of the Mercedes shut.

INT. SALE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

The interior of this house is ugly, oppressive and tasteless.

Carolyn opens the front door, breathes deeply and solemnly

announces:

She neatly arranges her sales materials on a desk, then

strips down to her undergarments.

We see Carolyn, working with fierce concentration as she:

Cleans glass doors that overlook the patio and pool;

Doggedly scrubs countertops in the kitchen;

Perches on a stepladder to dust a cheap-looking ceiling fan

in the master bedroom;

And vacuums a dirty carpet that will never be clean.

Throughout all this, she keeps repeating to herself:

INT. SALE HOUSE - BATHROOM - LATER

Carolyn stands in front of the mirror, wearing her suit once

more, applying lipstick. She stares at her reflection

critically.

She says this as if it were a threat, then notices a smudge

on the mirror and wipes it off.

EXT. SALE HOUSE - FRONT YARD - LATER

The front door opens to reveal Carolyn, greeting us with the

smile she thinks could sell ice to an Eskimo.

INT. SALE HOUSE - FOYER - CONTINUOUS

Smiling, Carolyn leads a man and woman into the living room.

They're thirtyish, and they've seen a lot of houses today.

The man and woman glance around the dark room, unimpressed.

The woman wrinkles her face, skeptical.

INT. SALE HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER

Carolyn enters, followed by a different couple in their

fifties.

INT. SALE HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - LATER

Carolyn stands with a different couple: African American,

late twenties. The woman is pregnant.

EXT. SALE HOUSE - BACK YARD - LATER

Carolyn stands by the pool next to two fortyish WOMEN.

CONTINUED:

A beat.

INT. SALE HOUSE - SUN ROOM - LATER

Carolyn enters, alone. She's furious. She locks the sliding

glass door and starts to pull the vertical blinds shut, then

stops. Standing very still, with the blinds casting shadows

across her face, she starts to cry: brief, staccato SOBS that

seemingly escape against her will. Suddenly she SLAPS

herself, hard.

But the tears continue. She SLAPS herself again.

She SLAPS herself repeatedly until she stops crying. She

stands there, taking deep breaths until she has everything

under control, then pulls the blinds shut, once again all

business. She walks out calmly, leaving us alone in the dark,

empty room.

We HEAR CHEERING and APPLAUSE.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

We're at a high-school BASKETBALL GAME. Teenage boys play a

fast and furious game. One team wearing pale blue and white

uniforms scores a basket. Perky cheerleaders jump up and down

as the CROWD goes wild.

CONTINUED:

Seated in the bleachers, next to the high school BAND, is a

group of about twenty TEENAGE GIRLS, dressed in pale blue and

white uniforms. Among them, Jane sits next to ANGELA HAYES.

At sixteen, Angela is strikingly beautiful; with perfect even

features, blonde hair and a nubile young body, she's the

archetypal American dream girl.

Jane stands and scans the bleachers.

INT. MERCEDES-BENZ ML320 - CONTINUOUS

Carolyn drives. Lester is slumped in the passenger seat.

CONTINUED:

Carolyn stares at him, unsure of how to respond.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - LATER

The uniformed girls now stand in formation on the gym floor.

In the crowded stands, Lester and Carolyn find seats.

The HIGH SCHOOL BAND plays "ON BROADWAY." On the gym floor,

the girls perform. They're well-rehearsed, but too young to

carry off the ambitious Vegas routine they're attempting.

Lester, watching from the stands, picks out his daughter.

His POV: Jane performs well, concentrating. Dancing awkwardly

next to her is Angela. Suddenly Angela looks right at us and

smiles... a lazy, insolent smile.

Lester leans forward in his seat.

His POV: We're focused on Angela now. Everything starts to

SLOW DOWN... the MUSIC acquires an eerie ECHO...

We ZOOM slowly toward Lester as he watches, transfixed.

His POV: Angela's awkwardness gives way to a fluid grace, and

"ON BROADWAY" FADES into dreamy, hypnotic MUSIC. The light on

Angela grows stronger, and the other girls DISAPPEAR

entirely.

Lester is suddenly alone in the stands, spellbound.

His POV: Angela looks directly at us now, dancing only for

Lester. Her movements take on a blatantly erotic edge as she

starts to unzip her uniform, teasing us with an expression

that's both innocent and knowing, then... she pulls her

uniform OPEN and a profusion of RED ROSE PETALS spill

forth... and we SMASH CUT TO:

INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - CONTINUOUS

Angela, fully clothed, is once again surrounded by the other

girls. The HIGH SCHOOL BAND plays its last note, the Dancing

Spartanettes strike their final pose, and the audience

APPLAUDS.

Carolyn claps along with the rest of the audience. Lester

just sits there, unable to take his eyes off Angela.

EXT. HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - LATER

The game is long over. Jane and Angela come out of the gym.

Her POV: Lester and Carolyn stand at the edge of the parking

lot.

She crosses reluctantly toward her parents, followed by

Angela.

An awkward beat.

CONTINUED:

She starts toward the parking lot. Lester stays behind.

Angela smiles, aware of the power she has over him. He is

mesmerized; grateful, even.

CONTINUED: (2)

Lester waves awkwardly as he crosses off.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - A FEW HOURS LATER

CLOSE on a solitary red ROSE PETAL as it falls slowly through

the air.

We're looking down on Lester and Carolyn in bed. Even in

sleep, Carolyn looks determined. Lester is awake and stares

up at us.

The ROSE PETAL drifts into view, landing on his pillow.

More ROSE PETALS fall onto the bed, and he smiles up at...

His POV: Angela, naked, FLOATS above us as a deluge of ROSE

PETALS falls around her. Her hair fans out around her head

and GLOWS with a subtle, burnished light. She looks down at

us with a smile that is all things...

Lester smiles back and LAUGHS, as ROSE PETALS cover his face.

EXT. ROBIN HOOD TRAIL - CONTINUOUS

A WHITE BMW 328si CONVERTIBLE is parked on the street outside

the Burnham's house. We HEAR girlish LAUGHTER from inside.

INT. ANGELA'S BMW - CONTINUOUS

Angela is behind the wheel, Jane in the passenger seat.

They're passing a JOINT back and forth.

CONTINUED:

An awkward beat. Jane stares at the floor.

EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

On VIDEO: Jane gets out of the car, still LAUGHING, and waves

as Angela pulls away. We ZOOM toward Jane as she walks up the

driveway. She turns suddenly, sensing our presence.

Her POV: We're looking at the COLONIAL HOUSE next door where

the moving van was parked earlier. The front porch is

shrouded in darkness... then a PORCH LIGHT abruptly reveals

Ricky. As usual, he's dressed conservatively. There is a

BEEPER attached to his belt, and his DIGICAM dangles loosely

around his neck.

Irritated, Jane stares at him, hard.

He looks back at her curiously, then raises his Digicam and

starts to videotape her.

His POV, on VIDEO: Jane, angry and self-conscious, turns and

walks quickly toward her house, flipping us off as she goes.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - FOYER - CONTINUOUS

Jane enters, closes and locks the door. She quickly TURNS OFF

THE LIGHT that's been left on for her, then peeks through a

window.

Her POV: There's no sign of Ricky.

Jane turns back into the room, her heart racing... and

smiles.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - JANE'S BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

CLOSE on an ADDRESS BOOK: A man's hand flips to the H page

and then his finger stops at the name Angela Hayes.

Lester, dressed for work, goes through Jane's address book.

We HEAR the SHOWER running in the adjacent bathroom. He grabs

Jane's phone and dials, then stands with the receiver to his

ear, nervous.

Lester is frozen, unable to speak. Suddenly, the SHOWER is

turned off in the next room. Lester hangs up and exits

quickly. A moment, then the PHONE RINGS. Jane emerges from

the bathroom, a towel wrapped around her torso, drying her

wet hair. She picks up the PHONE.

INT. HAYES HOUSE - ANGELA'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Angela is sprawled across her bed, on the phone.

CONTINUED:

Then Jane notices her address book open to the H page.

EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

On VIDEO: We're across from Jane's WINDOW, looking in. Jane

picks up the address book, frowning. She speaks into the

phone, but we can't hear her.

INT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Ricky stands at his window, videotaping. He lowers his

Digicam, but his eyes remain locked on Jane across the way.

INT. FITTS HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

BARBARA FITTS stands at the stove, flipping bacon strips

mechanically, her eyes focused elsewhere. At least ten years

younger than her husband, she's pretty in a June Cleaver-ish

way. The Colonel sits at a dinette reading The Wall Street

Journal. Ricky enters.

Startled, Barbara turns to him.

As she attempts to serve him bacon:

Ricky serves himself scrambled eggs from another pan, then

joins his father at the table.

CONTINUED:

A DOORBELL rings. The Colonel and Barbara look at each other,

alarmed.

The Colonel heads toward the living room, a little puffed up.

INT. FITTS HOUSE - FOYER - MOMENTS LATER

The Colonel opens the front door to reveal the two JIMS.

Jim #1 holds out a basket filled with flowers, vegetables and

a small white cardboard box tied with raffia.

The Colonel stares at them, suspicious.

CONTINUED:

The Jims look at each other, then back at the Colonel.

The Colonel looks at them, confused. Then it dawns on him.

INT. COLONEL'S FORD EXPLORER - LATER

The Colonel drives, staring darkly at the road ahead. In the

passenger seat, Ricky is using a CALCULATOR and jotting

numbers down in a NOTEBOOK.

The Colonel looks at Ricky sharply.

A beat, as Ricky continues his calculations, before he

realizes a response is expected from him. Then:

CONTINUED:

The Colonel's eyes flash angrily.

Ricky sighs, then looks at his father.

The Colonel is taken aback but quickly covers.

Case closed, Ricky goes back to his calculations.

CLOSE on the pencil in his hands: He's totaling two columns

of NUMBERS. Under the column "Income" he writes in swift,

bold strokes: $24,950.00.

EXT. HIGH SCHOOL CAMPUS - A SHORT TIME LATER

Jane and Angela are standing with two other TEENAGE GIRLS.

TEENAGE GIRL #1

Gross.

TEENAGE GIRL #1

So, did you do it with him?

TEENAGE GIRL #2

You are a total prostitute.

TEENAGE GIRL #2

So are you. You've only been in Seventeen once, and you

looked fat, so stop acting like you're goddamn Christy

Turlington.

The two TEENAGE GIRLS move away from Jane and Angela.

The Colonel's Ford Explorer pulls up, and Ricky gets out.

CONTINUED:

Angela stares at Jane, then her mouth widens into a smile.

Jane suddenly finds Ricky standing in front of her.

Angela shoots a wide-eyed look at Jane, who ignores it.

He looks at her intently, his eyes searching hers. Jane is

unnerved and has to look away. Ricky smiles and walks off.

CONTINUED: (2)

INT. FITTS HOUSE - DEN - THAT NIGHT

CLOSE on a TV SCREEN: "Hogan's Heroes" on Nick at Nite.

The Colonel and Barbara are seated on a couch, watching

television. The Colonel is smiling, enjoying the show;

Barbara just stares. The Colonel CHUCKLES at a joke and

startles her.

We HEAR a door opening elsewhere in the house, and Ricky

enters.

He sits on the couch, next to his father, and watches TV

along with them. The Colonel's smile fades.

The three of them stare at the TV, like strangers in an

airport.

INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - NIGHT

We HEAR MUSIC under a room full of people all talking at

once, as Lester and Carolyn enter a hotel ballroom. We FOLLOW

THEM as they pass a SIGN that reads:

GREATER ROCKWELL REALTOR RESOURCES GROUP

CONTINUED:

Inside the ballroom, well-dressed real estate professionals

stand in clumps, chatting. Catering waiters serve hors

d'eouvres.

Carolyn's jaw tightens, then:

She drags Lester toward a silver-haired MAN and his much

younger WIFE. We recognize the Man as BUDDY KANE, The Real

Estate King.

CONTINUED: (2)

He LAUGHS. A little too loudly. Carolyn quickly joins in.

She smiles her most winning smile at him. He knows this

persona well, only it's never pissed him off as much as it

does right now.

And he kisses her--a soft, warm kiss that speaks unmistakably

of sex--then turns to the others and grins.

Carolyn's smile is frozen on her face.

CONTINUED: (3)

He crosses off. Carolyn, Buddy and Christy watch him go.

INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Lester stands at the bar. A bartender pours him a drink.

The bartender complies. Lester takes his drink and turns to

face the center of the room.

His POV: Carolyn is talking to Buddy and Christy. She's on:

smiling, animated, LAUGHING too loud at their jokes.

Lester shakes his head. Ricky approaches him, wearing a

waiter's uniform, carrying a tray of empty glasses.

A beat. Lester looks away, scans the crowd, then downs the

rest of his drink in one gulp. Ricky just stands there,

watching him. Finally Lester turns back to Ricky: what does

this kid want?

CONTINUED:

Lester's surprised, but instantly intrigued.

INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Carolyn and Buddy are deep in conversation. Christy has

wandered off. Carolyn is nervous; Buddy seems amused.

They look at each other for a beat, then look away. This

situation is loaded and they both know it.

EXT. HOTEL - LATER

Ricky and Lester stand next to a dumpster behind the service

entrance to the hotel, smoking a JOINT.

CONTINUED:

Suddenly, the service entrance opens, and a large CATERING

BOSS in a cheap suit peers out at them. Ricky hides the

joint.

He goes back inside. Lester looks at Ricky, who shrugs.

Carolyn is standing in the open service entrance. Lester

quickly hides the joint behind his back.

CONTINUED: (2)

And she goes back inside.

Lester goes inside.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - LATER

Jane and Angela are watching MTV. We HEAR the back door open.

Jane switches off the TV.

She starts toward the kitchen. Jane doesn't like this.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Lester enters and opens the refrigerator.

He turns, and is instantly transfixed by:

His POV: Angela leans against the counter, twirling her hair.

She starts toward him.

She reaches inside the refrigerator to grab a bottle. As she

does, she moves to place her other hand casually on Lester's

shoulder. He sees it coming. Everything SLOWS DOWN, and all

sound FADES...

EXTREME CLOSE UP on her hand as it briefly touches his

shoulder in SLOW MOTION. We HEAR only the amplified BRUSH of

her fingers against the fabric of his suit, and its

unnatural, hollow ECHO...

BACK IN REAL TIME: She grabs the root beer and smiles at him.

CLOSE on Lester: his eyes narrow slightly, then:

He cups her face in his hands and kisses her. She seems

shocked, but doesn't resist as he pulls her toward him    with

surprising strength. He breaks the kiss, looking at her    in

awe, then he reaches up and touches his lips. His eyes    widen

as he pulls a ROSE PETAL from his mouth right before we    SMASH

CUT TO:

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Angela is back against the counter, drinking the root beer.

Lester stands by the refrigerator, gazing at her, still lost

in fantasy.

CONTINUED:

Jane watches from the doorway to the family room, feeling

incredibly awkward in her own home. Carolyn enters from the

dining room. Lester snaps out of it and grabs a root beer

from the refrigerator.

He takes a sip of his root beer, but it goes down the wrong

way and he starts COUGHING violently.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - JANE'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

Angela lays on the bed, in bra and panties, reading a

magazine. Jane, in an oversized T shirt, plays a video game

on her computer.

Jane glances at Angela, irritated.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Lester, still in his suit, stands outside Jane's room, his

ear up against the door. He can't believe what he's hearing.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - JANE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Jane covers her ears and starts SINGING to drown her out.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Lester, still listening, looks like he's about to implode.

Jane's SINGING stops.

Panicked, Lester scurries down the hall.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - JANE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

CONTINUED:

We HEAR the sharp TAP of a penny being thrown against glass.

Angela crosses to the window and looks out.

EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

We see Angela standing at the window in her underwear,

looking down at us. Jane joins her and is immediately

unnerved by:

Their POV: In the Burnham's DRIVEWAY, the word "JANE" is

spelled out in FIRE.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - JANE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

On VIDEO: We're across from Jane's window, looking in. Jane

tries to shut the drapes, but Angela won't let her.

Irritated, Jane retreats into the room. We ZOOM toward her,

even as Angela poses in the window; we're clearly not

interested in Angela. The ZOOM continues, searching for Jane,

who has disappeared. Finally, we settle on the small make-up

MIRROR where we see a REFLECTION of Jane, back at her

computer. She's smiling. Then suddenly the DRAPES CLOSE and

she's gone.

INT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Ricky sits in darkness with his DIGICAM, videotaping. He

lowers the camera and smiles... then something below catches

his attention. He leans out the window to get a better look

at:

EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

Ricky's POV: Through a WINDOW on the side of the Burnham's

GARAGE DOOR, we see Lester, still in his suit, digging

through shelves against the back wall.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

Lester digs through stuff stored on the shelves, searching

for something as if his very life depended on it.

He yanks aside COLLEGE YEARBOOKS, a racquetball RACQUET,

boxes of old HOT ROD MAGAZINES, an unopened remote-controlled

MODEL JEEP KIT, stacks of old vinyl LPs... finally his face

lights up when he finds:

A pair of DUMBBELLS obviously unused for many years.

Lester rips off his jacket and tie and unbuttons his shirt.

He glances around, finding his REFLECTION in the WINDOW as he

pulls off his shirt, then the T-shirt underneath. He eyes

himself critically: Angela was right, he's not in bad shape.

Just a few extra pounds around his middle that wouldn't be

hard to shed. He kicks off his shoes and begins to step out

of his pants.

INT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Ricky holds his Digicam up and starts to videotape.

EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

Ricky's POV, on VIDEO: Through a WINDOW on the side of the

Burnham's garage, we see Lester step out of his pants and

briefs. Then, naked except for his black socks, he grabs the

dumbbells and starts lifting them, watching his reflection in

the window as he does.

INT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Ricky stands at the window, videotaping.

CONTINUED:

Suddenly we HEAR someone trying to open a locked door.

Moving swiftly, Ricky pulls the drapes shut and switches on a

light. His room is a haven of high-tech. A state-of-the-art

multimedia COMPUTER crowds his desk, and high-end STEREO and

VIDEO EQUIPMENT line the shelves, as well as HUNDREDS OF CDs.

There is easily twenty thousand dollars worth of equipment in

this room.

Ricky opens the door. The Colonel stands outside, eyeing him.

The Colonel holds out a small PLASTIC CUP WITH A CAP.

He disappears down the hall. Ricky smiles, shuts and locks

his door. He puts the plastic cup on the shelf, then crosses

to a MINI REFRIGERATOR in the corner of his room and takes

out a cup-sized TUPPERWARE CONTAINER from the freezer,

already filled with urine, albeit frozen, and places it on a

saucer to thaw overnight.

INT BURNHAM HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

Carolyn lies sleeping. Lester is awake, staring at the

ceiling. After a moment, he gets up, taking care not to

disturb Carolyn, and walks toward the bathroom.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - MASTER BATH - CONTINUOUS

Lester enters and switches on the LIGHT. The room is filled

with STEAM. Lester looks around, confused, then focuses on:

His POV: Across from us, in a PEDESTAL BATHTUB, is Angela.

She smiles and beckons us, and we MOVE CLOSER. ROSE PETALS

float on the surface of the water, obscuring her naked body.

Lester kneels by the bathtub like a man in church.

She arches her back and looks up at him provocatively.

Lester gives her a hard look, then slowly slips his hand into

the water between her legs. Her eyes widen and she throws her

head back... and we SMASH CUT TO:

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

CLOSE on Carolyn, her eyes wide, listening to the rhythmic

BRUSH of Lester's hand as he masturbates under the covers.

She flips over and faces him.

A beat.

Carolyn switches on the bedside LIGHT.

CONTINUED:

He turns to her, trying to look innocent, then gives up.

Carolyn gets out of bed, repelled. Lester LAUGHS.

CONTINUED: (2)

She sinks into a chair, stunned. It's clear he knows where

she's most vulnerable. He sees this, and likes it; it feels

good to win for a change. He curls up under the covers

contentedly.

CLOSE on Lester, smiling.

EXT. ROBIN HOOD TRAIL - EARLY MORNING

We're FLYING high above the neighborhood. Below us we see the

two Jims, jogging. We APPROACH them steadily.

EXT. ROBIN HOOD TRAIL - CONTINUOUS

We're now at street level, FOLLOWING the two Jims.

Still running, the Jims turn back in perfect unison, as

Lester runs INTO FRAME, wearing a baggy sweatshirt and a pair

of faded old sweatpants. The Jims slow down until he catches

up, then the three men run together in the early morning

light.

CONTINUED:

EXT. FITTS HOUSE - A SHORT TIME LATER

The Colonel is washing his Ford Explorer, squatting to scrub

the bumper, when something Catches his eye:

His POV: Lester and the Jims jog down the street.

The Colonel stands, scowling, as Ricky comes out of the

house, holding the URINE SAMPLE in front of him.

Lester breaks off from the two Jims and jogs up to Ricky and

the Colonel, out of breath. He grabs hold of his knees and

bends over, panting.

He LAUGHS, and extends his hand to the Colonel.

CONTINUED:

He salutes the Colonel good-naturedly, grinning. The Colonel

doesn't think it's funny. An awkward beat.

He heads into the house. Lester waves at the Colonel, then

follows him. The Colonel watches them go, his eyes dark.

INT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Ricky enters, followed by Lester.

He gives the URINE SPECIMEN to Lester, then locks the door.

Ricky crosses to a bureau and opens a DRAWER. He takes

clothing out and piles it on his bed.

CONTINUED:

Lester picks up a CD case from a shelf and examines it.

He shakes his head, then puts the CD case down. Ricky, having

emptied the drawer, now removes a FALSE BOTTOM, revealing

rows of MARIJUANA, tightly packed in ZIP-LOC BAGS.

CONTINUED: (2)

A beat.

Lester smiles. This kid's cool.

EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - LATER

Carolyn, carrying a basket of fresh cut ROSES, passes by the

GARAGE WINDOW. From inside the garage, we HEAR ROCK MUSIC.

Carolyn stops and SNIFFS the air, frowning. She peers through

the window.

Her POV: Lester, in a T-shirt and gym shorts, lies on a new

WEIGHT BENCH, doing bench presses with shiny new BARBELLS.

INT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

ROCK MUSIC blasts from a new BOOMBOX on the floor.

The garage is in the process of becoming Lester's sanctuary.

An ugly but comfortable 70's BOWL CHAIR has been pulled out

and cleaned off, his old hot rod magazines strewn across it,

and the remote-controlled MODEL JEEP KIT is spread across a

card table. The SHELVES that Lester tore through earlier have

been dismantled, leaving a blank wall on which now hangs a

DART BOARD.

Lester finishes his last rep, straining, then puts the

weights in their rack and sits up. As he takes a drag off a

joint, the GARAGE DOOR suddenly starts to open. Lester looks

up, squinting at:

His POV: The door raises to reveal Carolyn, silhouetted

against the bright sunlight outside, pointing a REMOTE at us.

CONTINUED:

And she's gone. Lester leans back on the bench and grabs the

weights.

INT. BRAD'S OFFICE - DAY

Brad is seated behind his desk, reading a document. Lester

sits across from him, smiling.

CONTINUED:

A beat.

Brad sighs.

Brad LAUGHS.

Brad stops laughing.

Brad leans back in his chair, studying Lester.

INT. OFFICE BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

Exhilarated, Lester walks down a corridor, his belongings in

a box on his shoulder. He's happier than he's been in years.

INT. RESTAURANT - LATER THAT DAY

Carolyn sits at a table, lost in thought. There are two menus

on the table. After a moment, Buddy Kane, the Real Estate

King, joins her. Carolyn immediately becomes warm and

gracious.

Carolyn smiles, genuinely touched that he remembers her name.

CONTINUED:

He smiles, then opens his menu. Carolyn picks hers up

mechanically, but continues to stare at him, enraptured, like

a fervent Christian who's just come face to face with Jesus.

EXT. HIGH SCHOOL CAMPUS - LATER THAT DAY

Ricky stands with his DIGICAM, videotaping something on the

ground at his feet.

On VIDEO: A DEAD BIRD lays on the ground, decomposing.

On VIDEO: The camera JERKS up to discover Jane and Angela

staring at us.

On VIDEO: Angela looks at Jane, trying not to laugh.

On VIDEO: She falls out of frame as we ZOOM toward Jane.

Ricky lowers the Digicam.

CONTINUED:

He looks at her, curious, his eyes searching hers. She

doesn't look away.

Angela starts off, but Jane doesn't follow. Ricky smiles at

her. She almost smiles back, then:

Angela stops and stares at her.

EXT. TOP HAT MOTEL - LATER THAT DAY

Carolyn's Mercedes is parked next to a JAGUAR CONVERTIBLE

with a VANITY LICENSE PLATE that reads "R E KING."

INT. TOP HAT MOTEL - CONTINUOUS

Carolyn and Buddy are in the middle of sex.

CONTINUED:

EXT. STREET - LATER THAT DAY

Lester's TOYOTA CAMRY cruises through the streets. We hear

Lester SINGING along to "AMERICAN WOMAN" on the STEREO.

INT. TOYOTA CAMRY - CONTINUOUS

Lester is driving, smoking a joint.

EXT. MR. SMILEY'S - CONTINUOUS

Lester continues singing along to "AMERICAN WOMAN," as the

Camry pulls into the parking lot of a FAST FOOD RESTAURANT.

Lester pulls up to the drive-thru speaker box.

Lester turns down the volume on the stereo.

He pulls the car around to the WINDOW, where a teenage GIRL

wearing a headset is waiting.

CONTINUED:

Lester pays her. As she hands him his food, he notices a SIGN

in the corner of the window that reads:

NOW TAKING APPLICATIONS

She stares at him, confused by his age and attire.

INT. MR. SMILEY'S - A SHORT TIME LATER

Lester sits at a booth with the MANAGER, a greasy kid wearing

a white short sleeve shirt and a tie covered with the Mr.

Smiley's logo. He looks over Lester's application, baffled.

The Manager sighs and runs a hand through his greasy hair,

wondering what he could possibly have done to deserve this.

INT. TOP HAT MOTEL - LATER THAT DAY

Carolyn and Buddy are in bed, post-sex.

They laugh.

Carolyn sits up, eager to learn from the master.

Carolyn is quick to pick up her cue and kisses him, ready for

another round.

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - LATER THAT DAY

Ricky and Jane walk along without speaking. He seems

comfortable with the silence; she doesn't. After a beat:

CONTINUED:

A beat.

An automobile FUNERAL PROCESSION appears and begins to pass

them slowly.

They watch the FUNERAL CARS pass.

A beat.

CONTINUED: (2)

INT. FITTS HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Barbara Fitts sits at the kitchen table, staring off into

space as if hypnotized. Behind her, Ricky enters, followed by

Jane.

Barbara's eyes flutter and she turns to him slowly.

Jane glances around. The room is spotless.

INT. FITTS HOUSE - THE COLONEL'S STUDY - MOMENTS LATER

We HEAR KEYS TURNING in the lock, then the door opens and

Ricky enters, holding a RING OF KEYS, followed by Jane.

GLASS CASES filled with GUNS line the walls.

Ricky crosses to a built-in CABINET behind the desk.

He unlocks the cabinet and opens it, revealing shelves

stacked with WAR MEMORABILIA.

CONTINUED:

He reaches into the cabinet and carefully removes an oval

CHINA PLATTER, which he hands to Jane. She examines it.

CLOSE on the bottom of the plate: A small SWASTIKA is

imprinted in the center.

He puts the platter back into the cabinet and shuts the door,

then notices Jane looking at him oddly.

But she is. Ricky studies her.

INT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

On VIDEO: We're in an empty parking lot on a cold, gray day.

Something is floating across from us... it's an empty,

wrinkled, white PLASTIC BAG. We follow it as the wind carries

it in a circle around us, sometimes whipping it about

violently, or, without warning, sending it soaring skyward,

then letting it float gracefully down to the ground...

Jane and Ricky sit on the bed, watching his WIDE-SCREEN TV.

A beat.

Now Jane is watching him.

After a moment, Jane takes his hand. Then she leans in and

kisses him softly on the lips. His eyes scan hers, curious to

see how she reacts to this...

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Lester sits at the table in sloppy clothes, eating his dinner

voraciously and drinking beer from a bottle. Across from him,

Carolyn picks at her food, watching him with contempt. EASY-

LISTENING MUSIC plays on the STEREO.

CONTINUED:

We HEAR the back door SLAM, then Jane enters and quickly

takes her seat at the table.

Jane stares at both her parents, apprehensive. Lester looks

at Carolyn darkly, then flashes a "you-asked-for-it" grin.

CONTINUED: (2)

Jane does so, surprised and intimidated by the power in his

voice. Lester gets up, crosses to the other side of the table

to get a PLATE OF ASPARAGUS, then sits again as he serves

himself.

Lester hurls the plate of asparagus against the wall with

such force it SHATTERS, frightening Carolyn and Jane.

CONTINUED: (3)

He goes back to eating his meal, as if nothing unusual has

happened. Carolyn sits in her chair, shivering with rage.

Jane just stares at the plate in front of her.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - JANE'S BEDROOM - THAT NIGHT

Jane is sitting on her bed. There is a KNOCK at the door.

Jane rolls her eyes, crosses to the door and lets Carolyn in.

She stares at Jane, then starts to cry.

CONTINUED:

Carolyn suddenly SLAPS Jane, hard.

Embarrassed, she quickly leaves. Jane looks in a mirror and

rubs her cheek, then crosses to the window and looks out.

EXT. FITTS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Jane's POV: We're across from Ricky's room, looking in. He

stands at the window with his DIGICAM, videotaping us. On the

WIDE-SCREEN TV behind him, we see Jane standing in her window

as she looks across at him. She waves. Ricky just keeps

videotaping. A beat, then she starts to take off her shirt.

INT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

We're behind Ricky as he videotapes Jane in her window. She

has now removed her shirt. She stands there in her bra, then

reaches behind her back to unhook the bra.

On VIDEO: We ZOOM toward her as she takes off her bra

clumsily. She's obviously embarrassed, but she's gone this

far and there's no turning back. She stands there with her

breasts exposed, trying to look defiant, but she's achingly

vulnerable...

Suddenly, the door is thrown open and the Colonel enters,

incensed. Startled, Ricky turns around. As soon as his eyes

meet his father's, he knows what's up.

Ricky scrambles to dodge his father, but the Colonel is too

fast; he punches Ricky in the face, knocking him to the

floor.

EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

From her window, Jane watches, pulling the drapes in front of

her.

EXT. FITTS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Jane's POV: In the WINDOW across from us, the Colonel

proceeds to give Ricky a serious beating, punching his face.

INT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Ricky's lip is bleeding, but he maintains a steady gaze at

his father during this violence.

The Colonel grabs him by the collar.

A beat.

The Colonel glances toward the window.

His POV: In the WINDOW across from us, Jane peeks out from

behind the drape. She quickly pulls it shut.

A beat. The Colonel is suddenly, deeply shamed.

CONTINUED:

The Colonel stands, still breathing heavily. Tenderness fills

his face, and he reaches out to touch Ricky's cheek.

But something keeps him from doing it.

He leaves. Ricky gets up and goes to his bureau. He looks at

his reflection in the mirror, calmly takes a cloth and starts

to wipe the blood from his face.

In darkness, we HEAR repetitive GUNSHOTS.

INT. INDOOR FIRING RANGE - ONE MONTH LATER

Carolyn, wearing PROTECTIVE HEADGEAR, is holding a GLOCK 19

AUTOMATIC REVOLVER with both hands, FIRING it directly at us.

She empties a round and stands there, exhilarated. An

ATTENDANT approaches with a new round of ammunition.

CONTINUED:

And she starts FIRING again.

INT. MERCEDES-BENZ ML320 - LATER

Bobby Darin sings "DON'T RAIN ON MY    PARADE" on the RADIO.

Carolyn SINGS along as she drives.    Her face has lost its

usual resolute determination; she's    actually enjoying herself

spontaneously, and the lack of her    usual self-consciousness

allows us to see just how beautiful    she is.

ANGLE ON the GLOCK 19 sitting on the passenger seat amidst

some CDs.

Carolyn takes the gun and holds it at arm's length, admiring

it as she continues to SING.

EXT. ROBIN HOOD TRAIL - CONTINUOUS

The Mercedes turns onto Robin Hood Trail.

INT. MERCEDES-BENZ ML320 - CONTINUOUS

Carolyn's POV: We turn into the Burnham driveway. A 1970

PONTIAC FIREBIRD with racing stripes blocks our access to the

garage.

CLOSE on Carolyn: She doesn't like having things in her way.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Lester's REMOTE-CONTROLLED MODEL JEEP is zooming across the

floor of the family room, expertly maneuvering corners and

narrowly avoiding crashing.

Lester is sprawled on the couch in his underwear, drinking a

BEER and controlling the car. His working out is beginning to

produce results. The room, too, seems changed: sloppier, more

lived in.

Carolyn enters through the kitchen, flushed and angry. She

just stands there, staring at Lester. After a moment, he

looks up at her.

CONTINUED:

He smiles at her playfully. She stares back, annoyed. It's

the same look she had at the beginning, when he dropped his

briefcase, but whatever power that look had is gone. Lester

just LAUGHS.

CONTINUED: (2)

His face is close to hers, and suddenly the atmosphere is

charged. She pulls back automatically, but it's clear she's

drawn to him. He smiles, and moves even closer, holding his

beer loosely balanced. Then, just before their lips meet...

She's immediately sorry she said it, but it's too late. His

smile fades, and the moment is gone.

He stands and gestures toward all the things in the room.

Carolyn stares at him, on the verge of tears, then turns and

walks out of the room before he can see her cry.

INT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

On VIDEO: Jane lays in Ricky's bed, wearing a tank top. She

glances at us.

CONTINUED:

We're watching the WIDE-SCREEN TV in Ricky's room.

A CORD leads from the TV to Ricky's DIGICAM. Ricky holds the

camera, sitting naked in a chair. It's been almost a month

since his father beat him up, and there are still slight

SCARS on his face. He's aiming his camera at Jane.

She gets out of bed, takes his Digicam and focuses it on him.

We see his image on the TV as she videotapes.

Jane ZOOMS in on his face, which remains placid.

Ricky smiles.

CONTINUED: (2)

He grabs a half-smoked JOINT from an ashtray and lights it.

He passes her the joint, then takes the Digicam and focuses

it on her. We see her image on the TV as he videotapes.

CONTINUED: (3)

Jane looks into the camera, a loopy, stoned grin on her face.

They LAUGH. She lays back on the bed.

Her mind wanders for a beat.

Jane looks at him and sits up.

She stands and sticks out her breasts, then falls back on the

bed, LAUGHING.

CONTINUED: (4)

She smiles dreamily at him. He turns the Digicam off and the

TV screen goes BLUE. He lowers the camera and looks at her

intently.

He puts the Digicam down and joins Jane on the bed. A long

moment where neither of them speaks. He caresses her hair,

gazing into her eyes.

EXT. ROBIN HOOD TRAIL - EARLY MORNING

We're FLYING above Robin Hood Trail. We see the BURNHAM'S

HOUSE below us as we APPROACH it steadily.

We're almost on top of the Burnham house now, as Lester,

wearing sweatpants and running shoes, bursts out of the front

door and dashes up the driveway.

EXT. ROBIN HOOD TRAIL - A SHORT TIME LATER

We're now at street level, as Lester runs toward us. He

carries a WALKMAN and wears EARPHONES, and we HEAR ROCK MUSIC

as he runs. The endorphins have kicked in, and Lester grins,

reveling in the sheer physical pleasure of his body.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - KITCHEN - A SHORT TIME LATER

The blender GRINDS as Lester, still in his sweatpants, makes

himself a high-protein shake. He's in excellent shape; even

his posture has changed, and he moves with the confident,

easy swagger of an athlete. Jane watches him blankly from the

kitchen table.

Carolyn enters. Lester leans against the counter, drinking

his shake directly from the blender pitcher, eyeing her. He's

got a newfound sexual energy that makes her uncomfortable,

and he knows it. Carolyn quickly rinses off her coffee cup,

avoiding his eyes, and starts out.

Jane looks at Lester to see how he reacts. He doesn't.

And she's gone. Jane continues staring at her father.

Finally, he glances over at her.

CONTINUED:

Jane is stunned. She quickly rises, trying to get out of the

kitchen before she starts crying.

ANGLE on Lester, and the immediate regret in his eyes.

INT. FITTS HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

We're outside Ricky's room, MOVING slowly toward the open

door, through which we can see Ricky, standing at his bureau

mirror, combing his hair. The scars on his face are almost

gone now.

A REVERSE ANGLE reveals the Colonel standing outside the door

looking in, watching Ricky with great tenderness. Then Ricky

looks up at him, and the Colonel is suddenly self-conscious.

EXT. FITTS HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - MOMENTS LATER

Ricky emerges from the house, followed by the Colonel, who

watches his son as he heads toward the Burnham house.

His POV: Carolyn waves from the Mercedes, flashing an

insincere smile. Jane leans forward from the passenger seat

and glares at us. As Ricky starts to get in the car, Lester

emerges from the house in his sweatpants.

Ricky pulls his door shut, but not before Lester mouths "call

me" and Ricky gives a slight nod in acknowledgment.

CONTINUED:

CLOSE on the Colonel's face: he looks confused.

As the Mercedes backs out of the driveway, Lester glances

over at him.

Lester's POV: The Colonel watches the car driving off, then

looks at us. His face tightens.

LESTER studies him for a moment, then grins and salutes

before going inside the house.

CLOSE on the Colonel, deeply troubled.

INT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

The door swings open silently and the Colonel enters. He

starts going through Ricky's bureau. He opens the DRAWER in

which we know Ricky keeps his marijuana, but he doesn't

discover its false bottom. He stands and looks around, his

eyes finally landing on:

The DIGICAM and a stack of CASSETTES on a shelf. The camera

is still connected to the TV.

The Colonel turns on the TV, examines the Digicam and presses

"play." The TV's blank screen suddenly gives way to...

On VIDEO: Barbara Fitts sits at the kitchen table, staring

off into space.

The Colonel watches, at first baffled, then impatient. He

takes the cassette out of the Digicam and inserts another. On

the TV screen we see...

On VIDEO: Through the Burnham's GARAGE WINDOW, we see Lester

step out of his pants and briefs. Then, naked except for his

black socks, he grabs the dumbbells and starts lifting them,

watching his reflection in the window as he does...

The Colonel sinks slowly onto Ricky's bed, mesmerized.

INT. MR. SMILEY'S - LATER

Lester, wearing a Mr. Smiley's uniform, is happily flipping

burgers on a grill.

CONTINUED:

Lester looks up suddenly when he HEARS:

Lester's face darkens, then... he smiles. He puts his spatula

down.

EXT. MR. SMILEY'S - CONTINUOUS

The Mercedes pulls around to the DRIVE-THRU WINDOW. Carolyn

drives; Buddy sits beside her.

They are too involved with each other to notice Lester

watching them from the drive-thru window.

Carolyn almost jumps out of her skin.

CONTINUED:

Lester leans out of the drive-thru window, grinning at her,

holding bags filled with fast food. The Counter Girl stands

next to him, staring blankly.

Carolyn struggles to appear nonchalant.

CONTINUED: (2)

Carolyn closes her eyes, defeated, then grabs the wheel,

shifts gears and drives off.

EXT. TOP HAT MOTEL - A SHORT TIME LATER

The sky is filled with ominous gray clouds. Wind whips

garbage across the parking lot as Carolyn's Mercedes pulls in

next to Buddy's Jaguar.

INT. MERCEDES-BENZ ML320 - CONTINUOUS

Carolyn grips the wheel tightly, staring straight ahead.

Buddy looks at her unhappily.

She regrets it the second it's out of her mouth, and turns to

him. He just looks at her sadly, then gets out of the car and

shuts the door. She starts to CRY. As before, she SLAPS

herself, hard.

She closes her eyes tight, trying to stop the tears, then

suddenly SCREAMS as loud as she can.

EXT. TOP HAT MOTEL - CONTINUOUS

Buddy's Jaguar speeds off, leaving the Mercedes alone in the

parking lot. We can still HEAR Carolyn's muffled SCREAMING.

There is a sound of distant THUNDER.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - GARAGE - THAT NIGHT

It's RAINING outside. We HEAR ROCK MUSIC as Lester pumps

iron. He puts the weights down and looks at his REFLECTION in

the window:

His POV: His arms are pumped. He smiles.

CONTINUED:

He reaches under the bench and grabs a CIGAR BOX. Opening it,

he digs through MARIJUANA PARAPHERNALIA, only to pull out an

empty ZIP-LOC BAG.

INT. FITTS HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Ricky and the Colonel sit at the table, eating in silence.

Barbara rinses off a pan at the sink, then stares at it as if

she can't quite remember what she meant to do with it. We

suddenly HEAR a BEEPING noise. Ricky pulls his BEEPER off his

belt and checks it.

He heads into the hall. The Colonel watches him go, uneasy.

INT. ANGELA'S BMW - CONTINUOUS

Angela drives, squinting through the windshield as the wipers

move back and forth.

CONTINUED:

INT. FITTS HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

The Colonel rinses off his plate at the sink. Something

outside catches his eye, and he cranes his neck to get a

better look at...

His POV: Through the window over the sink, we can see into

the Burnham's GARAGE WINDOW. Our view is blurred by the RAIN,

but we see Lester, his upper body pumped and glistening in

sweat as he counts out a wad of BILLS... and then Ricky walks

into view.

The Colonel's face tightens.

His POV: Lester drapes his arm around Ricky as he gives him

the money. We can only see Lester from the waist up, so he

looks naked.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

Ricky, his hair wet from the rain, puts the cash in his

pocket. Lester's arm remains draped around his shoulder.

And he slaps Ricky playfully on the chest. Ricky grins, then

squats down and reaches under the weight bench.

Lester sits in the bowl chair and leans back, his hands

behind his head, watching Ricky roll the joint.

INT. FITTS HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

The Colonel's POV: Lester leans back in his chair. We see

only Ricky's back and shoulders as he rolls the joint. After

a beat, Lester's jaw drops, then he throws his head back.

From our perspective, it looks very much like Ricky is giving

Lester a blow job.

The Colonel watches, incredulous. Then we HEAR a CAR

APPROACHING, and the Colonel glances over at:

His POV: Angela's BMW pulls into the driveway, stopping

behind Lester's Firebird. As Angela and Jane get out and run

toward the house, our focus MOVES back to the GARAGE WINDOW.

Ricky stands, looking a little panicked. Lester pulls on his

T-shirt, and both he and Ricky cross out of view.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Lester leans nonchalantly against the counter. Jane and

Angela enter. Jane frowns when she sees him.

He's trying to remain cool, and doing a pretty good job.

Jane rolls her eyes and exits. Angela walks over to Lester.

She places her hand on his arm flirtatiously, looks up at him

and smiles, fully expecting to intimidate him by doing so.

CONTINUED:

But something has changed, and he isn't intimidated at all.

He looks directly back at her, leans in and smiles slowly.

His voice is low and intense. She moves away, suddenly

insecure.

And she heads out quickly. Lester watches her go, baffled.

INT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Ricky enters, wet from the pouring rain, and crosses to his

bureau, pulling the wad of CASH out of his pocket as he goes.

Ricky turns, startled.

His POV: The Colonel steps out of the shadows.

Ricky takes a step back.

CONTINUED:

The Colonel BACKHANDS Ricky so hard it sends the boy

sprawling.

A beat. Ricky suddenly smiles. He gets up.

Ricky eyes the Colonel. He's finally discovered a way to

break free from his father, and he can't believe it was this

simple.

CONTINUED: (2)

Ricky grabs his backpack, turns and walks out the door,

leaving the Colonel standing there, glassy-eyed and breathing

heavily.

INT. FITTS HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Ricky enters to discover Barbara standing in the middle of

the room, clutching a dish, frightened. She's obviously heard

his argument with his father, and she looks into his eyes,

searching, aware that something eventful is taking place.

A beat.

He kisses her cheek softly, then exits out the back door,

leaving her standing alone, still clutching her dish.

INT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

The Colonel's POV: Below us, Ricky dashes through the rain to

the Burnham's front door and knocks. Lester opens it and lets

him in.

EXT. FITTS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

The Colonel looks coldly down at us from Ricky's bedroom

window, and then he pulls the drapes shut.

EXT. FREEWAY - CONTINUOUS

The MERCEDES-BENZ ML320 is parked in the breakdown lane, its

HAZARD LIGHTS BLINKING. Cars ZOOM past in the rain.

INT. MERCEDES-BENZ ML320 - CONTINUOUS

Carolyn sits behind the wheel, listening to a MOTIVATIONAL

TAPE on the STEREO.

CONTINUED:

Carolyn leans over and open the glove compartment. She takes

out her GLOCK 19.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - JANE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Angela is sprawled across the bed. Jane stands across the

room from her.

There is a KNOCK on the door. Jane sits up, alarmed.

Jane jumps up and opens the door and lets him in.

CONTINUED:

CONTINUED: (2)

Angela stares at him, stunned, then starts toward the door.

And she exits, SLAMMING the door behind her. Jane turns to

Ricky and he takes her in his arms.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Angela sits on the stairs, shaken, crying.

EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

We're MOVING SLOWLY toward the Burnham's GARAGE WINDOW

through the RAIN. Through the window, we see Lester, wearing

only his sweatpants, performing bench presses.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

Through the window, we see the Colonel standing outside,

watching. We ZOOM slowly in on him as he watches, transfixed.

EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

His POV: Lester finishes his last rep, then racks the weights

and sits up, sweaty and out of breath. He runs his free hand

over his chest... and then he glances at us, suddenly aware

he's being watched.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

Lester and the Colonel stare at each other through the

window.

EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

The RAIN is coming down in sheets now, and there is a sharp

CLAP of THUNDER. We're directly outside the GARAGE DOOR as it

slowly lifts to reveal Lester smiling at us.

CONTINUED:

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

Lester pulls the Colonel inside. The Colonel moves stiffly

and seems preoccupied, slightly disoriented.

The Colonel just stands there, looking at Lester.

The Colonel moves closer towards him.

He grins... and so does the Colonel.

He places his hand on the Colonel's shoulder. The Colonel

closes his eyes.

CONTINUED:

He opens his eyes and looks at Lester, his face filled with

an anguished vulnerability we wouldn't have thought possible

from him. His eyes are brimming with tears. Lester leans in,

concerned.

I...

The Colonel reaches up and places his hand on Lester's

cheek... and then kisses him. Lester is momentarily stunned,

and then he pushes the Colonel away. The Colonel's face

crumples in shame.

The Colonel stares at the floor, blinking, and then he turns

and runs out the open garage door into the rainy night.

INT. MERCEDES-BENZ ML320 - CONTINUOUS

Carolyn is still listening to the same MOTIVATIONAL TAPE. She

holds the GLOCK in her hand.

Carolyn switches the TAPE OFF and puts the gun in her purse.

EXT. FREEWAY - CONTINUOUS

The Mercedes pulls away from the shoulder.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Lester enters, opens the refrigerator and grabs a BEER.

Suddenly we HEAR MUSIC coming from the other room. Lester

opens his beer and starts toward the family room.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

His POV: AS we MOVE SLOWLY around a corner, Angela comes into

view, standing at the STEREO, holding a CD case. She's been

crying; her face is puffy, and her hair mussed. She regards

us apprehensively... then puts on a slightly defiant smile.

Lester leans against the wall and takes a swig of his beer.

She smiles. They stand there in silence; the atmosphere is

charged.

She's trying to be seductive as she says this, but she's

pretty bad at it. Lester raises his eyebrows.

Lester grins. He is sexy.

She nods. Lester holds the bottle up to her mouth and she

drinks clumsily. He gently wipes her chin with the back of

his hand.

CONTINUED:

His face is very close to hers. She's unnerved--this is

happening too fast...

Angela takes a deep breath just before Lester leans in to

kiss her cheek, her forehead, her eyelids, her neck...

And Lester kisses her on the lips.

INT. MERCEDES-BENZ ML320 - CONTINUOUS

Carolyn drives, her face resolute.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Angela lays back on the couch as Lester moves in over her. He

pulls her jeans off and gently brushes his fingers over her

legs, then moves up and caresses her face...

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - JANE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Ricky and Jane, fully clothed, lie curled up on Jane's bed.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Lester starts unbuttoning Angela's blouse. She seems

disconnected from what's happening. Lester pulls her blouse

open, exposing her breasts.

Lester looks down at her, grinning, unable to believe he's

actually about to do what he's dreamed of so many times, and

then...

Lester LAUGHS.

A beat. Lester looks down at her, his grin fading.

His POV: Angela lies beneath us, embarrassed and vulnerable.

This is not the mythically carnal creature of Lester's

fantasies; this is a nervous child.

CONTINUED:

Lester's face falls. There's no way he's going to go through

with this now.

He grabs a blanket from the back of the couch and drapes it

around her shoulders, covering her nakedness.

He smiles and shakes his head. Humiliated, Angela starts to

cry.

He hugs her, letting her put her head on his shoulder,

stroking her hair and rocking her gently.

Lester takes her by the shoulders and looks at her, serious.

But she keeps crying. Lester hugs her again. We HEAR a loud

CLAP of THUNDER outside.

EXT. ROBIN HOOD TRAIL - MOMENTS LATER

The Mercedes pulls onto Robin Hood Trail.

INT. MERCEDES-BENZ ML320 - CONTINUOUS

CLOSE on Carolyn's eyes, reflected in the REAR-VIEW MIRROR.

She turns her head to look out the window:

Her POV: The RED DOOR of the Burnham house stands out, even

in the pouring rain.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Angela, once again fully clothed, sits at the kitchen

counter. She's eating a turkey sandwich.

Lester puts a jar of mayonnaise back in the refrigerator.

He turns to her and cocks an eyebrow.

A long beat, as Lester studies her, then:

CONTINUED:

Angela shifts uncomfortably.

Angela rolls her eyes at how silly this notion is.

An awkward beat.

They just sit there, smiling at each other, then:

She crosses off. Lester watches her go, then stands there

wondering why he should suddenly feel so content.

Something at the edge of the counter catches his eye, and he

reaches for...

CLOSE on a framed PHOTOGRAPH as he picks it up: It's the

photo we saw earlier of him, Carolyn and Jane, taken several

years ago at an amusement park. It's startling how happy they

look.

Lester crosses to the kitchen table, where he sits and

studies the photo. He suddenly seems older, more mature...

and then he smiles: the deep, satisfied smile of a man who

just now understands the punch line of a joke he heard long

ago...

After a beat, the barrel of a GUN rises up behind his head,

aimed at the base of his skull.

ANGLE ON an arrangement of fresh-cut ROSES   in a vase on the

opposite counter, deep crimson against the   WHITE TILE WALL.

Then a GUNSHOT suddenly rings out, ECHOING   unnaturally.

Instantly, the tile is sprayed with BLOOD,   the same deep

crimson as the roses.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - FOYER - MOMENTS LATER

Ricky comes down the stairs, followed by Jane.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Ricky opens the door from the dining room, then stops. Jane

appears behind him.

Their POV: A pool of blood is forming on the kitchen table.

Ricky comes into the kitchen and slowly approaches Lester's

lifeless body, wide-eyed but not afraid. Jane follows him, in

shock. Ricky kneels, gazing at Lester's unseen face... then

he smiles, ever so slightly.

His POV: Lester looks back at us; his eyes are lifeless, but

he's smiling the same slight smile.

EXT. SKY - DAY

We're FLYING across a white blanket of clouds.

EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

In BLACK & WHITE: Eleven-year-old Lester looks up, pointing

excitedly at:

His POV: A DOT OF LIGHT falls across an unbelievably starry

sky.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - JANE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Ricky and Jane lie curled up on Jane's bed, fully clothed. We

HEAR a GUNSHOT from downstairs. They look at each other,

alarmed.

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DUSK

In BLACK & WHITE: Maple trees in autumn. Ghostly LEAVES

FLUTTER slowly toward pavement.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - POWDER ROOM - NIGHT

Angela stands in front of the mirror, fixing her make-up. We

HEAR the GUNSHOT again. Angela turns, frightened.

INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY

In BLACK & WHITE: CLOSE on an ancient woman's papery HANDS as

they button a cardigan sweater.

EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - NIGHT

Carolyn walks slowly toward the RED DOOR, drenched to the

bone, clutching her PURSE tightly. We HEAR the GUNSHOT again.

EXT. SUBURB - DAY

In BLACK & WHITE: A 1970 PONTIAC FIREBIRD in the driveway of

a suburban home. The SUN'S REFLECTION in the windshield

FLASHES BRILLIANTLY.

INT. FITTS HOUSE - THE COLONEL'S STUDY - NIGHT

The Colonel enters, wet. He's wearing LATEX GLOVES. BLOOD

covers the front of his T-shirt. He paces in front of one of

his GUN CASES; the GLASS DOOR is open, and a gun is

conspicuously missing from inside.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - HALL - NIGHT

In BLACK & WHITE: Jane opens her bedroom door, staring at us.

EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DUSK

In BLACK & WHITE: A door opens to reveal 4-YEAR-OLD JANE,

dressed for Halloween in a Princess costume, holding a lit

SPARKLER aloft and smiling shyly at us.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

Carolyn enters, terrified, still clutching her PURSE. She

shuts the door and locks it, then takes the GLOCK 19 out of

her purse. She opens the closet door and shoves the gun into

a HAMPER. Then, suddenly aware of Lester's scent, she grabs

as many of his clothes as she can and pulls them to her,

burying her face in them. She sinks to her knees, pulling

several items of clothing down with her, and she begins to

cry.

EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK - NIGHT

A younger Carolyn sits across from us in one of those

SPINNING-TEACUP RIDES, LAUGHING uncontrollably as she twists

the wheel in front of her, making us SPIN even faster.

EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

On VIDEO: We're watching the video Ricky showed Jane earlier,

of the empty white PLASTIC BAG being blown about. The wind

carries it in a circle around us, sometimes whipping it about

violently, or, without warning, sending it soaring skyward,

then letting it float gracefully down to the ground...

EXT. - ROBIN HOOD TRAIL - DAY

We're FLYING once again over Robin Hood Trail, ASCENDING

SLOWLY.
