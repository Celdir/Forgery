DARKNESS. THE SOUND OF WIND AND SPRAY.

MUSIC. TITLES.

EXT. OCEAN -- NIGHT

The darkness is actually water. A SEARCHLIGHT arcs across

heavy ocean swells. Half-a-dozen flashlights -- weaker beams --

racing along what we can see is the deck of an aging FISHING

TRAWLER.

FISHERMEN struggling with a gaff -- something in the water --

A HUMAN CORPSE.

EXT. FISHING BOAT DECK -- NIGHT

THE BODY sprawled there. The Sailors all talking at once --

three languages going -- brave chatter to mask the presence

of death --

THE BODY MOVES! -- convulsing -- coughing up sea water --

the Sailors -- freaked -- jumping back -- standing there, as --

THE MAN begins to breathe.

INT. FISHING BOAT BUNK ROOM -- NIGHT

A wreck. Too small for all the people in here right now --

SAILORS sweeping off the table -- rough hands laying THE MAN

down --

THE CAPTAIN -- brutal and impatient -- watching from the

door as --

GIANCARLO tears through the clutter -- searching for a medical

kit buried in the shambles. GIANCARLO is sixty. A bloodshot

soul.

GIANCARLO with an old trunk -- just getting it open, as --

GIANCARLO watching them run out. Snagging a quick pull on a

pint of rum he's got stashed and --

INT. FISHING BOAT BUNK ROOM -- DAWN -- TIME CUTS

Transformed into a makeshift operating room. A light swings

overhead. THE MAN layed out across the table. Sounds -- groans --

words -- snatches of them -- all in different languages.

GIANCARLO playing doctor in a greasy kitchen apron. Cutting

away the clothes. Turning THE MAN on his side. Two bullet

wounds in the back. Probing them, judging them.

Now -- GIANCARLO with a flashlight in his teeth -- TINK --

TINK -- TINK -- bullet fragments falling into a washed-out

olive jar.

Now -- something catching GIANCARLO'S EYE -- A SCAR ON THE

MAN'S HIP -- another fragment -- exacto knife cutting in --

tweezers extracting A SMALL PLASTIC TUBE, not a bullet at

all, and as it comes free --

THE MAN'S HAND SLAMS down onto GIANCARLO'S and we SMASH CUT

INTO A --

FIRST PERSON POV -- we are staring up at --

Long dead pause.

EXT. OCEAN -- DAY

The Trawler plows through heavy seas.

INT. FISHING BOAT BUNK ROOM -- DAY

GIANCARLO is hunched over a desk -- tweezers and flashlight --

busy working at that strange plastic tube that came out of

THE MAN's hip.

THE MAN is bandaged. He's sitting up, and it must hurt like

hell, but physical pain is not the thing troubling him right

now. He's staring around the room -- at his body -- at the

walls -- haunted --

Silence. THE MAN can't rest. Too busy trying to make sense

of all this.

GIANCARLO rummaging around -- finding a magnifying glass --

INSERT -- MAGNIFIED POV -- a slip of plastic from the tube --

written there -- 000-7-17-12-0-14-26.  GEMEINSCHAFT BANK,

ZURICH.

GIANCARLO staring at him now. Different suddenly. Suspicious.

GIANCARLO pulls his pint. Takes a hit.

EXT. FISHING BOAT DECK -- NIGHT

THE MAN stands at the rail, staring out to sea. So lost. He

turns to head inside -- there, a surfcasting rod propped

against a locker.

THE MAN picks up the rod -- flips the bail -- traps the line --

now he's casting far out into the darkness. And for the first

time, he smiles.

INT. FISHING BOAT GALLEY -- NIGHT

A ratty old espresso machine. THE MAN standing there, staring

at the thing like it's a test. Then his hands begin to move --

trying to pack a grind -- trying to fit it in -- turning on

the steam and --

The whole thing explodes.

EXT. FISHING BOAT DECK -- DAY

THE MAN alone doing chin-ups on the deck rail. He's still

bandaged and the wounds must hurt like hell, but he's pushing

himself. Using the pain -- bathing in it -- maybe even hoping

that it will hold some answer for him.

INT. FISHING BOAT GALLEY -- NIGHT

A chess board. Wooden pieces jumbled in a box. THE MAN

hesitates -- takes a black knight from the box -- lingers

for a moment -- and then places it on the board. He's off

and running. He knows this. Placing pieces faster and faster --

still setting it up, as we --

INT. FISHING BOAT HEAD -- NIGHT

One of the ugliest bathrooms on the planet. THE MAN standing

before a pitted, tarnished, cataract of a mirror. Staring at

himself.

And then he speaks.

And then he stops. Blinks. Wipes away the perspiration just

beading on his forehead.

No answer. Just that face. His face. Who am I?

And what else is inside there?

EXT. FISHING BOAT -- DAY

SAILORS hauling in the nets. THE MAN -- still bandaged, but

healing -- working beside them. Earning his keep. Getting

healthy.

EXT. ITALIAN COASTLINE -- DAWN

A small, colorful fishing village. The trawler motoring in.

INT. THE FISHING BOAT BUNK ROOM -- SAME TIME

THE MAN buttoning up borrowed clothes. GIANCARLO pulling

some cash from his pocket --

GIANCARLO gives him a look. Shakes his head, and --

INT. POKEY ITALIAN TRAIN STATION -- DAY

The ticket window. THE MAN and a TICKET AGENT.

EXT. TGV -- DAY

A HELICOPTER SHOT -- a bullet train speeds through snow-

capped Alps. We move in on a window -- and staring out is...

INT. TGV TRAIN -- DAY

...THE MAN. People all around him -- families -- businessmen --

normal people going about their lives. THE MAN turns back to

the window, but he's not watching the scenery -- he's looking

at his reflection. So lost. His face suddenly plunged into

darkness as the train bombs into a tunnel...

EXT. TRAIN -- NIGHT

...and out of the darkness into night and the HELICOPTER

SHOT, as the train races toward ZURICH.

INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY

A VIDEO MONITOR -- FULL FRAME -- meet WOMBOSI. He's an African

ex-dictator, think Idi Amin crossed with Mobutu. He's in

some sort of throne room. And he's angry. Bodyguards and a

translator hovering nervously around him. What this is, is

NEWS FOOTAGE -- an interview conducted by a German TV station.

MARSHALL, a CIA bigwig has the remote control. And the floor.

TWELVE CIA MANDARINS sitting around the table like kids in

detention. We will tour the faces as MARSHALL continues, but

the guy we're interested in is named WARD ABBOTT. Picture a

sawier, slicker John Poindexter.

ABBOTT'S FACE says this is news to him. HIS HANDS suggest

otherwise.

Long pause. No hands go up.

INT. ZURICH TRAIN STATION -- NIGHT

THE MAN wandering through the terminal. Passing A PIZZA PLACE

closing up for the night.

THE MAN checks his funds. Just enough for one cold slice.

EXT. ZURICH STREETS -- NIGHT

THE MAN walking aimlessly.

EXT. ZURICH PARK -- NIGHT

THE MAN trying to get comfortable on a bench. It's chilly

but this will have to do until morning.

Just settling in, when --

THE MAN turns. TWO ZURICH COPS coming toward him.

THE MAN makes his feet. They're on top of him now.

THE MAN not sure what to do. Eyes moving. Mouth shut.

THE MAN raising his hand slowly -- ZURICH COP #1 reaching up

to pat him down --

ZURICH COP #2 has heard enough -- giving a sharp poke with

the nightstick -- into THE MAN's back -- and that's the last

thing he'll remember because --

THE MAN is in motion.

A single turn -- spinning -- catching COP #2 completely off

guard -- the heel of his hand driving up into the guy's throat

and --

COP #1 -- behind him -- trying to reach for his pistol, but

THE MAN -- still turning -- all his weight moving in a single

fluid attack -- a sweeping kick and --

COP #1 -- he's falling -- catching the bench -- trying to

fight back but -- THE MAN -- like a machine -- just

unbelievably fast -- three jackhammer punches -- down-down-

down and -- COP #1 -- head slammed into the bench -- blood

spraying from his nose -- he's out cold and --

COP #2 -- writhing on the ground -- gasping for air --

struggling with his holster -- THE MAN -- his foot -- down --

like a vise -- onto COP #2's arm -- shattering the bone --

COP #2 starting to scream, and then silenced because --

THE MAN -- he's got the pistol -- so fucking fast -- he's

got it right up against COP #2's forehead -- right on the

edge of pulling the trigger -- he is, he's gonna shoot him --

-- stopping as --

THE MAN slams the gun against his temple and --

This fight is over.

THE MAN standing there. In the silence. Two unconscious cops

at his feet. Blood on his pants. What just happened? How did

he do this? And there's THE GUN in his hand. And God, it

just feels so natural -- checking it -- stripping it down --

holding it -- aiming it -- like this is something he's done

a million times before...

This is something he definitely knows how to do.

And then he stops cold. Throwing down the gun. Running off

into the darkness --

INT. TREADSTONE -- DAY

A deep, inner office. An ops office. Operations. Unlabeled

and anonymous. A backwater project center hidden deep within

the Langley facility. Utilitarian. Several rooms linked like

a suite.

Small staff. SEVERAL TECHNICIANS. One or two for

communications. A couple for research. People are at their

posts. And it's all quiet. But they are busy. Quietly urgent.

This is a place under siege.

ZORN is the number two here. Brilliant bloodless lapdog.

He's coming through the suite. Coming through quickly. Heading

toward the boss's little office at the back --

TED CONKLIN. Ivy League Ollie North. Buttoned down. Square

jaw. Everything tucked away. But there's tension in the air.

Work on the desk. Cot in the corner.

INT. CIA COMMISSARY -- NIGHT

ABBOTT with coffee. CONKLIN not lingering.

Silence. Pressure drop.

EXT. ZURICH -- DAY

Morning in the financial district. Upscale. Uptight.

GEMEINSCHAFT BANK just one of many elegant fortresses on

this street. Everything just now opening for business. TWO

GUARDS unlocking the front door and --

THE MAN across the street. Tucked in the shadows. Checking

for cops and trouble. Looks clear. He's walking and --

INT. BANK RECEPTION AREA -- DAY

Ornate, formidable and tech at the same time.

THE MAN standing before her. Looking very out of place.

THE RECEPTIONIST nods. Pulls a pen and bank card.

THE MAN takes the pen, as we --

INT. BANK SECURITY CHECKPOINT -- DAY

A BIO-METRIC SCANNER. A piece of ultra-tech amidst the

Baroque. TWO SERIOUS BANK GUARDS manning the equipment.

THE MAN standing there, staring down at this machine.

Something ominously decisive about this. What if it's him?

What if it's not?

THE MAN focuses. Here we go -- BANK GUARD #2 guiding his

open palm onto the mirrored scanning surface.

THE MAN catching his reflection for a moment before a wave

of white light passes beneath his hand and now --

INT. BANK HALLWAY -- DAY

THE MAN being led by A THIRD GUARD to a special elevator.

INT. DEEPER INSIDE THE BANK -- DAY

Elevator doors open. THE MAN steps out. MR. APFEL -- anal

Zurich banker -- waiting there.

APFEL nods. Gestures down the corridor --

INT. BANK SAFETY DEPOSIT VIEWING ROOM -- DAY

Sterile and kind of odd. But total privacy. THE MAN sitting

there, as A DEPOSIT GUARD places a large SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX

before him. THE GUARD leaves the room. Closing the door behind

him.

THE MAN is alone. And there it is, right in front of him.

This is it. Here are the answers. He lifts the lid.

THE BOX. There's a shallow tray on top. In this tray: a beat-

up passport in the name of Jason Bourne. A French driver's

license with a Parisian address. Credit cards for Jason

Bourne.

THE MAN. Holding these objects close -- as if by holding

them he might absorb their essence. Forcing himself to

believe. This is him. His picture. There it is. He's Jason

Bourne.

BACK TO -- THE BOX -- the shallow tray on top. There's

Kleenex. Several sets of contact lenses. A knife. A comb.

Three sticks of gum. A ring. A pair of sunglasses. A Rolex.

BOURNE setting these things aside.  Lifting the top tray.

Staring into THE DEEP BOTTOM TRAY and --

First of all...

MONEY. Lots of it. Ten thousand dollar stacks of hundreds.

Lots of them. Close to a million dollars. There's A GUN. A

very good gun. Several clips of ammo. And...

FIVE MORE PASSPORTS. All clean. Crisp. Brand new. All with

his photo inside. Five different names. Three different

Countries. Each one of these pristine passports clipped to a

piece of card stock that says:

NAME:

NATIONALITY:

PLACE OF ISSUE:

SIGNATURE SAMPLE:

And a bar code.

Two Dutch passports. A French. A South African. A Belgian.

And...

There's one piece of card stock still with the paper clip in

place. And no passport. This card reads:

NAME: John Michael Kane

NATIONALITY: U.S.A.

PLACE OF ISSUE: Paris, France

There's a signature sample.

And a bar code. But no passport. This one is missing.

BOURNE sitting there. Trying to push his confusion away.

But there's something hollow about this. He came looking for

one identity and now he's faced with six. The money... The

gun...

Suddenly, it's all fucked up.

BOURNE into gear. Looking around the room -- there -- there's

a pile of red canvas burn bags in the corner. BOURNE grabbing

one -- stuffing everything into it -- everything except...

The gun. He doesn't want the gun. No guns.

INT. BANK SAFETY DEPOSIT OUTER AREA -- DAY

BOURNE is done. Handing the box back to THE DEPOSIT GUARD --

EXT. STREETS OF ZURICH -- DAY -- VARIOUS SHOTS

BOURNE exits the bank. The red bag full to its limit. He's

walking briskly now. Looking for a taxi. Nothing in sight.

BOURNE crossing the street. Shit, there's A COP on the corner --

turn -- change pace -- make it look natural --

BOURNE around a corner. And it's looking good for a moment --

but only a moment -- TWO MORE COPS walking a beat -- walking

this way -- turn -- cut -- cross the street --

BOURNE heading down a boulevard. Trying to look small. Pulse

starting to race. Fighting the paranoia. Where the hell is a

cab? Turning back fast as A SIREN starts bleeding in from

behind him --

It's just an ambulance.

BOURNE turning back. Forcing himself to focus. And fuck --

there's A METER MAID, and she's stopped writing up a ticket --

she's staring at him and --

BOURNE trying not to panic -- don't run -- smile -- stay

small -- get to the corner -- scan the options -- but --

THE METER MAID -- she's watching him go and she's pulling

her radio and --

BOURNE hitting this next corner -- banging a right -- forcing

himself not to run -- glancing back and --

THERE'S ANOTHER COP -- but this one is jogging -- searching --

he's got his radio out and --

FINALLY TO --

BOURNE bailing on the street -- disappearing into --

EXT. U.S. EMBASSY COMPOUND -- DAY

Big gates. Speed barricades. SEVERAL U.S. MARINES standing

guard near a gate house. An American flag. Lots of people

coming and going. BOURNE playing it as normal as possible as

he heads for the entrance.

INT. U.S. CONSULATE ZURICH -- VISA ROOM -- DAY

The passport and visa office. Big room. No windows. Unpleasant

on purpose. Two lines: A short one for U.S.  Citizens, a

marathon for everyone else. CONSULATE CLERKS stationed in

open cubicles along the back wall. And it's a zoo. American

tourists who've lost their passports. Foreigners looking for

visas. Asylum seekers. Everyone here has a problem.

BOURNE on the U.S. line. Standing there trying to think.

What's he gonna say? What can he say? With the cops outside,

and the incident in the park, then the bank...

A NEARBY CUBICLE. Meet MARIE KREUTZ. German. Big energy.

Real beauty hidden beneath the armor. And armor it is, because

this is a warrior in full, crisis battlemode.

A CONSULATE CLERK caught in her headlights.

That shuts her up. Yes. Today she's a student.

INT. CIA OFFICE COMPLEX -- NIGHT (BUT SAME TIME)

Motion -- CONKLIN racing down a staircase -- ZORN chasing

after --

INT. U.S. CONSULATE -- VISA ROOM -- DAY

BOURNE on line. Fear meter rising by the minute.

BOURNE'S POV

Scanning the room -- the perimeter -- the people -- A TURKISH

MAN almost in tears as he tries to explain his case to a

DESK CLERK -- TWO AMERICAN BACKPACKERS that have lost their

passports -- MARIE still in the midst of her madness -- A

SECURITY CAMERA high on the wall capturing everything --

lots of data -- too much going on and --

BOURNE comes to. Shit. It's his turn.

A WOMAN CLERK waving him forward. BOURNE trying to think --

what the fuck is he doing? -- what's he gonna say? -- now

he's at the window, and if he was looking for a friendly

face, he came to the wrong place --

But he's already bailing, walking away from the woman, the

window, the room -- he's out of here --

INT. U.S. CONSULATE LOBBY -- DAY

BOURNE on the move -- hustling back toward the lobby -- trying

to snag a view out to the street -- there's a window just

ahead and --

BOURNE'S WINDOW POV -- ZURICH COPS -- outside -- on the street --

half-a-dozen of them lingering around the entry gate and --

BOURNE stalled for a moment -- options dwindling -- he can't

go back to the passport office -- he can't go out the front

and --

The lobby looks tough -- there are two other points of entry

into the main building, but they're both guarded by MARINES

and METAL DETECTORS --

As he gets closer -- it gets worse --

A ZURICH POLICE INSPECTOR near the door, in deep conversation

with TWO MARINES and THE EMBASSY SECURITY OFFICER and --

BOURNE trying to burrow through the human traffic -- trying

to get to THE LARGER OF THE TWO ENTRY GATES -- this one the

farthest from the front door and the passport office corridor,

and it's the most crowded -- A COUPLE PEOPLE lined up here --

waiting for one of THE THREE MARINES STAFFING THIS POST to

check their bags and pass them through a metal detector and --

BOURNE turns back -- as does everyone else in the lobby --

BOURNE glancing back -- ONE OF THE GATE MARINES BEHIND HIM --

the guy's raising his M-16 --

BOURNE nodding -- total compliance -- starting to drop --

but only starting, because now --

He's swinging the backpack and --

THE GUN MARINE -- nailed -- blind-sided -- no chance and --

BOURNE -- all motion -- all forward -- all perfect -- vaulting

the metal detector even as he pulls ONE OF THE PEOPLE ON

LINE around to shield his back and --

ANOTHER GATE MARINE -- right there -- trying to grab him --

making his move -- BOURNE -- almost an afterthought -- his

boot -- like a knife -- out of nowhere -- SNAP! -- the guy's

arm just shattered and --

THE SECURITY CHIEF -- freaking out -- TWO MARINES WITH HIM --

they're raising their weapons and there's people in the lobby

and --

BOURNE -- landing hard on THE GUN MARINE -- rolling away

from the gate -- into the building now -- coming up with the

backpack and --

And he does -- BOURNE with the M-16! -- coming up with it --

coming up on the move -- swinging it around as he searches

for an escape route and THE GUN -- it's like a magic wand of

hysteria --

PEOPLE IN THE LOBBY -- SCREAMING -- diving away -- everyone

dropping for cover and --

BOURNE -- bailing -- on the run -- sprinting down a hallway --

tossing away the M-16 as he sprints into the building --

INT. U.S. CONSULATE OFFICE HALLWAY -- DAY

Quiet for a second -- offices on either side of a carpeted

hallway -- BUREAUCRAT-TYPES doing their thing, when suddenly --

Here comes BOURNE -- coming fast -- and he definitely does

not belong back here --

INT. U.S. CONSULATE LOBBY/SECURITY GATE -- DAY

Panic -- people fleeing the lobby -- MORE MARINES hustling

in from outside and --

INT. U.S. CONSULATE FIRE STAIRWELL -- DAY

Door flies open -- BOURNE bombing in -- shit! -- it's a dead

end -- no way out but up the stairs --

INT. U.S. CONSULATE GROUND FLOOR CORRIDOR -- DAY

SECURITY CHIEF -- THREE MARINES -- sidearms drawn -- jogging

past the INNER OFFICES -- running beside them, a frantic guy

in a suit --

INT. U.S. CONSULATE BACK STAIRWAY -- DAY

BOURNE climbing fast -- two -- three -- stairs at a time --

racing up as a SECURITY ALARM STARTS SCREAMING -- bleet --

bleet -- bleet --

INT. U.S. CONSULATE FIFTH-FLOOR GRAND HALLWAY -- DAY

THE ALARM ringing everywhere -- TRADE CONFERENCEES -- sixty

confused and frightened people -- spilling out into the

corridor --

INT. U.S. CONSULATE FIFTH FLOOR KITCHENETTE -- DAY

A NEW DOOR flying open -- it's BOURNE -- ready for anything,

but there's nothing -- he's in a butler's prep area off the

main conference room -- momentum stalled for a moment --

nothing in here but tablecloths and silverware and coffee

cups and --

INT. U.S. CONSULATE BACK STAIRWAY -- DAY

THREE MARINES -- armed and stoked -- staring up the stairs --

leapfrogging -- point-to-point assault procedure --

INT. U.S. CONSULATE MAIN STAIRS -- DAY

Carpeted and grand -- SECURITY CHIEF with FIVE MARINES NOW --

charging up -- pushing past THE PEOPLE trying to come down

and --

INT. U.S. CONSULATE FIFTH FLOOR GRAND HALLWAY -- DAY

Completely clogged now -- PANICKED TRADE PEOPLE all over --

EMBASSY TYPES -- trying to herd them toward the main stairs --

everyone talking at once -- THAT ALARM STILL BLARING and --

And as the crowd reacts -- as they mob back away from the

main stairway -- we see -- holy shit, the guy yelling was

BOURNE --

INT. U.S. CONSULATE BACK STAIRWELL -- DAY

THE ASSAULT MARINES -- still climbing -- weapons out -- clean

and fast -- one more flight to go -- ready for anything --

completely freaking out as the door above them on the fifth

floor flies open and --

MARINE GUNS swinging up -- trigger fingers tense and --

IT'S TRADE PEOPLE! and now THEY'RE SCREAMING and this combined

with THE ALARM and THE MARINES YELLING FOR THEM TO GET DOWN

and ALL OF IT ECHOING THROUGH THE STAIRWELL and --

INT. U.S. CONSULATE MAIN CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY

BOURNE -- he's CLOSING A DOOR behind him -- he's jamming A

CHAIR -- wedging it in tight so the door won't open and --

INT. U.S. CONSULATE FIFTH FLOOR GRAND HALLWAY -- DAY

THE SECURITY CHIEF -- HIS MARINES -- coming from the main

stairs -- weapons drawn -- fighting their way through the

pandemonium and --

INT. U.S. CONSULATE MAIN CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY

BOURNE scanning for options -- the room is huge -- empty now --

the massive conference table covered with the meeting papers

left behind -- windows along one wall and --

BOURNE rushes to the window staring down and --

BOURNE'S WINDOW POV

Fifty feet below there's a courtyard -- it's a sheer drop --

completely fucked and --

INT. U.S. CONSULATE FIFTH FLOOR GRAND HALLWAY -- DAY

SECURITY CHIEF -- TWO MARINES -- just outside THE CONFERENCE

ROOM DOOR -- trying it -- it won't budge and --

INT. U.S. CONSULATE MAIN CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY

THE DOOR -- shattering -- eaten up by GUNFIRE! -- TAT-TAT-

TAT-TATTAT-TAT-TAT-TAT! and --

WHAM! HERE THEY COME -- through the door -- guns -- eyes --

adrenaline -- everything ready and --

THE ROOM IS EMPTY!

EXT. U.S. CONSULATE BUILDING WALL -- DAY

BOURNE -- dangling fifty-feet above the stone courtyard! --

he's gone out the window! -- hanging there -- hanging with

one hand -- one hand clutching the corner of a ledge and --

INT. U.S. CONSULATE MAIN CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY

Utter confusion -- SECURITY CHIEF -- FIVE -- SIX -- SEVEN

ARMED MARINES all piling in -- ready to rock but there's no

one to shoot -- no target --

TWO MARINES -- scanning the windows -- looking down and --

MARINE POV -- all clear -- no way he went down there and --

EXT. U.S. CONSULATE BUILDING WALL -- DAY

BOURNE still hanging there -- looking down -- up -- there's

no choice -- he has to go down --

BOURNE finding a toehold below him -- reaching -- touching

down -- it gives way -- crumbling and --

BOURNE hesitates. Does he know how to do this or not? Stalled

for a moment, then...

BOURNE starts climbing down. And this is all one shot. No

cutaway. No cheating.

We are watching a master at work...

Handhold to a drain pipe. Swinging to a better ledge.

Dropping to an air-conditioner. Grabbing a window frame just

before the air-conditioner gives way. Teetering there. Now

he's on the fourth floor.

Below, there's an open window on the third floor. Struggling

to keep his balance, he reaches behind him to shift the weight

of the bag, and as he does --

THE RED BAG falls. Thump. Into the courtyard. Forget the

open window. Now he's got to go all the way.

Timing his next move and --

He's pushing off -- reaching -- there's another drainpipe

and he's snagged it -- he's got a dragline now -- starting

to fall -- straining to hold the pipe -- slowing his descent --

the drainpipe pulling away from it's housing and --

BOURNE letting go -- just before he falls backward -- one

last grab -- catching a gutter -- holding it just long enough

to slow his fall and --

Letting go for the last fifteen feet and --

EXT. U.S. CONSULATE FIFTH FLOOR GRAND HALLWAY -- DAY

A DOZEN MARINES -- pumped-up and listening to --

EXT. AN ALLEYWAY NEAR THE U.S. CONSULATE -- DAY

MARIE storming away. Pissed-off -- broke -- illegal -- ruined

and --

A LITTLE RED CAR. A beat-to-shit Euro car. A shitty little

red car angled in beside a dumpster with a big red Zurich

parking ticket on the windshield.

MARIE grabbing the ticket -- tearing it up -- tearing the

shit out of it -- blind with misfortune -- throwing the pieces

on the ground and stomping on them and then --

BOURNE standing across the car -- on the passenger side --

BOURNE tosses cash -- a stack of hundreds -- across the car

into her hands -- she catches it. Looks at it.

MARIE looking at him. At the money. Back at him, and --

INT. TREADSTONE COMMUNICATIONS DESK -- NIGHT

VIDEO PLAYBACK -- FULL FRAME -- fast forward -- a speeding

blur of images from a surveillance camera outside the Zurich

bank -- it's two days worth of footage -- they're scanning

for Bourne's arrival and --

COM TECH #1 working the console. Freezing the image. Punching

it up. There it is -- BOURNE leaving the bank with the red

bag.

ZORN the phones across the room. COM TECH #2 at his console --

CONKLIN up from the console. ZORN waiting for him --

Silence. Like the floor just fell away. So heavy.

A moment between them. CONKLIN all steel here now.

CONKLIN breaks away -- back to the console and --

EXT. BARCELONA RESIDENTIAL BOULEVARD -- DAY

Establishing shot. A grand house. PIANO MUSIC over this --

someone butchering a piece by Haydn and --

INT. BARCELONA GRAND HOUSE MUSIC ROOM -- DAY

Meet THE PROFESSOR. He's a piano teacher. Late fifties.

Deceptively fit. He's sitting here, listening to a NINE-

YEAR-OLD STUDENT struggle through the music.

And then, HIS E-PHONE PAGER starts pulsing -- hum -- hum --

INT. HAMBURG CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY

A boring, marathon business meeting. FIFTEEN MIDDLE MANAGERS

are trapped around a German sales presentation. Meet MANHEIM.

Bald. Fifty. He looks dumb and piggy. Anything but. Sitting

here --

And then, HIS E-PHONE PAGER starts pulsing -- hum -- hum --

EXT. A ROMAN CAFE -- DAY

Meet CASTEL. He's thirty-five. Slender. Clean-cut. Easy to

miss. He's here alone. Reading the paper. Sipping espresso.

And then, HIS E-PHONE PAGER starts pulsing -- hum -- hum --

EXT. A ROAD ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF ZURICH -- DAY

The little red car parked. MARIE pacing around. BOURNE poring

over a map spread out over the hood.

BOURNE looks back from the map.

BOURNE just grabbed her. Both of them shocked that he's done

this. He immediately pulls back.

Silence now. She looks back. Measuring him.

EXT. ROME STREET -- DAY

CASTEL through the streets on a motorcycle. Whipping to a

stop -- stepping off the bike in front of --

U-STORE-IT STORAGE WAREHOUSE.

INT. STORAGE WAREHOUSE ELEVATOR -- DAY

CASTEL and THE ELEVATOR OPERATOR -- rising slowly through

the dark warehouse and --

INT. CASTEL'S STORAGE UNIT -- DAY

Darkness -- a key turning -- door opening -- light goes on

to reveal CASTEL standing there and we're in --

CASTEL'S STORAGE UNIT. What's in here? Like nothing. Like a

stack of old newspapers in the corner. Some mildewed books

piled along one wall. Some shitty plastic chairs.

QUICK TIME CUTS

CASTEL working fast. Closing the door. Moving to the pile of

books. Taking the top book off. Opening it.

INSIDE THE BOX -- a timer. A small bomb. A booby-trap. An

LED light stops flashing as CASTEL'S HANDS code in his

password and --

CASTEL moving to the newspapers stacked in the corner.

Pulling away the top pile and --

A METAL LOCK BOX. Hidden here. CASTLE pulling it out. Opening

it. An empty tray on top and --

CASTEL taking off his watch. Taking off his rings. Taking

out his wallet. His Spanish passport. Emptying his pockets.

All of this goes into the empty tray and --

CASTEL lifting away this top tray -- setting it aside and --

THE METAL LOCK BOX -- there's more -- a much larger bottom

compartment -- and it's deja-vu all over again -- we're

looking at the identical contents we saw Bourne find in the

Zurich safe-deposit box.

First of all...

MONEY. Lots of it. Ten thousand dollar stacks of hundreds.

Lots of them. A GUN. A very good gun. A dozen clips of ammo.

And FIVE MORE PASSPORTS. All clean. Brand new. All with his

photo. Five different names. Four different countries. Each

one of these pristine clipped to a piece of card stock that

says:

NAME:

NATIONALITY:

PLACE OF ISSUE:

SIGNATURE SAMPLE:

A BAR CODE:

Two Italian. Two Spanish. A Portuguese.

CASTEL going for the Portuguese passport and --

EXT. ALPS HELICOPTER SHOT -- DAY

The little red car driving through The Alps.

INT. THE RED CAR -- DUSK

BOURNE staring out the window. MARIE driving. Long silence

until --

MARIE staring at him -- glancing back to the road -- just in

time -- almost rear-ending a slow moving truck --

There it is. And she wants an answer --

BOURNE staring at her. She's furious. She's downshifting --

she's accelerating -- pulling out to pass the truck on a

blind turn, as we --

EXT. ZURICH BANK -- DAY/DUSK

APFEL emerges from the bank. Leaving work. Turns the corner

into a quiet side street and --

Up ahead, here comes another guy in a suit. It's MANHEIM

walking toward us, deep into a cell phone conversation. Barely

noticing Apfel as they get closer and --

As they pass -- MANHEIM -- it's completely out of the blue --

he's jabbing the cellphone down into Apfel's shoulder and --

APFEL -- no clue -- already clutching at the coronary

exploding in his chest -- dead before his body hits the street

and --

MANHEIM -- still walking -- he's never broken stride -- and

as he goes he's fiddling with the cellphone and --

INSERT -- THE CELLPHONE -- MANHEIM'S HANDS working to retract

a syringe into the device and --

MANHEIM striding away. Disappearing into Zurich...

INT. PARIS MORGUE -- NIGHT

Not the best morgue in town. Cold tile. A wall of freezers.

Death lighting. Now add some color. Meet NYKWANA WOMBOSI in

the flesh.

Meet HIS ENTOURAGE -- eight or ten of his thirty children --

two of his wives -- three of his bodyguards -- the whole

crew spread out in this horrible basement room. THE WIVES

are chatting. THE KIDS are playing, fighting and eating candy.

THE BODYGUARDS -- three of them here -- are white. These

guys are French/Corsican mercs. Not quite the A-Team. The

guy in charge of this ugly little unit is named DEAUVAGE.

Into it. Too into it.

TWO MORGUE ATTENDANTS hanging back. THE MORGUE BOSS -- who's

clearly suffering this for a bribe -- moves to one of the

freezer lockers...

And he pulls open FREEZER #121. And thank God we can't see

it, because whatever's inside there is clearly horrible. THE

MORGUE BOSS barely takes a glance, standing back as quickly

as possible.

DEAUVAGE -- lead bodyguard -- moves to clear a zone for his

boss --

WOMBOSI moves to the freezer box. Stares down. As if it were

nothing. He's seen -- he's made -- much, much worse. And now

he reaches down into the box -- hands on -- literally feeling

around this dead, awful corpse with his bare hands -- feeling

around for something -- feeling and feeling and not finding --

DEAUVAGE looking pale as WOMBOSI slams shut the freezer.

EXT. PARIS STREET -- NIGHT

A MINI-MOTORCADE driving towards Neuilly. Two security cars.

A van full of kids and mothers. And one big Mercedes stretch.

INT. THE MERCEDES STRETCH LIMO -- NIGHT

WOMBOSI alone in the back. Looking haunted.

INT. TRUCKSTOP CAFE -- NIGHT

It's a weird spot. Open all night. But Euro-style. Quiet

tonight. A few Alpen-truckers chowing down. A local or two

at the bar and --

BOURNE AND MARIE at a back table. Drinking coffee. He's got

the red bag open. All the passports -- the personal junk --

the money -- all the shit from the Zurich bank box -- he's

been showing it to her --

And he's got her attention now.

She's not listening. He leans in. Flat out now.

Long dead pause.

INT. TREADSTONE RESEARCH DESK -- DAY

BOURNE'S FACE -- a video image frozen on A COMPUTER SCREEN --

it's Bourne looking at the camera -- Bourne looking up at

the camera in the consulate passport office and --

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

HALF A DOZEN COMPUTER MONITORS -- and lots of shots of Bourne --

twenty angles -- twenty different locations -- twenty candid

perspectives of Bourne and his mad scramble through the

consulate --

CONKLIN and RESEARCH TECH #1 poring over these surveillance

tapes downloaded from Zurich --

CONKLIN rubbing at the tension in his temples as ZORN enters --

INSERT -- THE MONITOR -- as the image enlarges to fill the

screen. And there's Bourne. And the little red car. And Marie.

EXT. ZURICH AIRPORT HOTEL -- NIGHT

A drone barn. Practically on the runway.

INT. ZURICH AIRPORT HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

One of those rooms. Just a plain functional box. MANHEIM

laying on the bed. Fully dressed. Suit and tie. Just laying

there, staring at the ceiling. Who knows how long he's been

like this.

Just waiting.

ON THE NIGHTSTAND -- A gun. A knife. His e-phone pager. His

fresh credentials. And a photo of Jason Bourne.

INT. WOMBOSI'S PARIS COMPOUND -- NIGHT

Quick orientation: Picture a heavily-walled palace just off

the Bois Du Boulogne. But once inside you could be back in

Brazzaville. It's just a buffet of oddness. Home to fifty

children and nine wives. The decor blends money and nouveau

riche materialism with a hard, back-home tribal esthetic.

It's a visual treat. Not condescending or stupid, but flat-

out strange and menacing.

It's late. And the palace is dark and sleepy now, but carry

all that through this next series of quick shots --

WOMBOSI HOUSE SECURITY STATION

Just inside the door. BODYGUARD #1 slouched before a bank of

SECURITY MONITORS.

WOMBOSI MAIN HALLWAY

Littered with toys. Children's crap everywhere. BODYGUARD

#3. Snoozing on a Louis Quatorze chair draped with African

cloth.

WOMBOSI THRONE ROOM DOORS

DEAUVAGE -- head bodyguard -- posted outside this imposing

set of doors. He's trying to stay awake. Reading a spy

thriller.

FINALLY TO

WOMBOSI'S THRONE ROOM

And there he is -- the emperor himself -- WOMBOSI on his

throne. Except the room is dark and empty. And he's sitting

there by himself. A king without a country.

Sitting there. With a gun in his lap. Drinking hard from a

bottle of Jack Daniels.

Stewing.

EXT. FRENCH ROADSIDE -- DAWN

Beautiful morning. The red car parked along the road. BOURNE

alone in the passenger seat. Deep asleep. Nestled there.

And then, he wakes suddenly. Starts. Freaked for a moment.

Instantly feeling for the red bag. There it is in his lap.

He looks around and --

MARIE sitting away from the car. She's got a loaf of bread.

A soda. Smoking a butt. Same clothes, but her make-up's been

washed away. Clean. Simple. Gorgeous.

BOURNE steps out. Morning legs.

Another silence. She's watching him.

She looks away. Was she hoping for another answer?

INT. TREADSTONE CONKLIN'S OFFICE -- DAY

MARIE'S FACE -- A PASSPORT PHOTO -- she's eighteen -- she's

smiling -- really alive and fresh and --

CONKLIN behind his desk. ABBOTT staring grimly at the picture --

CONKLIN hesitates. Inside he's screaming.

EXT. PARIS STREET NEAR BOURNE'S APARTMENT -- DAY

THE LITTLE RED CAR cruising through town.

INT. THE LITTLE RED CAR -- DAY

MARIE driving. BOURNE checking building numbers as they pass --

AN APARTMENT BUILDING. Big building. Elegant but cold.

MARIE pulling up -- turning a corner -- watching him as she

does. But he's pre-occupied -- eyes scanning -- taking it

all in --

MARIE angles into an alleyway. Cuts the engine.

Dead pause. She's waiting. He's still scanning the street.

He turns back. She's staring at him.

Before she can say anything, he's digging in the backpack.

He pulls out another stack of hundreds. Hands it over. She

takes it. It's not what she wanted, but she's used to being

disappointed. Fighting it.

Silence. That moment. He focuses. Getting it.

MARIE smiles. We've never seen it before. Worth waiting for.

INT. PARIS APARTMENT BUILDING FOYER -- NIGHT

BOURNE and MARIE standing at the directory. Five apartments.

One per floor. Five names. A buzzer. An intercom. There it

is.

J. Bourne.

BOURNE presses the buzzer. After a moment, he presses again.

Nothing.

BOURNE checking the door. How to pop it open? Just about to

get into it, when --

THE CONCIERGE is sixty. Plump and proper.

THE CONCIERGE looking at BOURNE like maybe she's never seen

him look like this before. And she's looking at MARIE like

here's the reason her tenant looks like such shit.

THE CONCIERGE nods. Instant chilly disapproval.

THE CONCIERGE steps aside and --

INT. PARIS APARTMENT FIFTH FLOOR LANDING -- DAY

BOURNE and MARIE at the apartment threshold. He has a key

now.

Turning it. And the door opens...

Nothing...

No bombs. No wife and kids. No one.

INT. PARIS APARTMENT -- DAY

A huge, rambling flat. Large entry hallway. Large rooms beyond

that. It's obviously expensive. But cold. Completely

impersonal. No photographs. No mementoes. No human history.

WE'RE MOVING NOW

THE LIVING ROOM

BOURNE and MARIE exploring.

BOURNE silent. Struggling to get a feel for the place.

MARIE taking it in fast. BOURNE seems paralyzed. Trying to

soak it all in. Willing himself home. Touching things as he

passes. As if a texture, a smell -- something will become

familiar. He's deep into this as we go to --

THE BEDROOM

MARIE in the doorway. Checking it out. It's so clean and

simple. But it's not the decor she's most interested in...

MARIE opening an armoire...

Nothing but men's clothes. No competition. She's feeling

better by the moment as we go to --

THE KITCHEN

Like a stage set. Lots of props and no sign of food. BOURNE

picking up a frying pan.

THE MASTER BATHROOM

MARIE still on the prowl. Mirror city. Big tub. One

toothbrush.

AN OFFICE STUDY

There's a desk. Chair. Phone. Basic. BOURNE with a folder in

his hand. Staring at the bookshelves. Binders, reference

materials and hardbound volumes -- all of it about maritime

law. Ship schedules. Registry catalogs. All about boats.

MARIE backs out. BOURNE alone again. Standing there for a

moment. Dealing with it.

And then he sits down in a chair.

BOURNE sitting there. Staring. The room, the desk -- it's

all so devoid of personality. And then, something catches

his eye and --

INSERT -- THE DESK TOP -- a faint silhouette through the

dust and grime. Outlines of where a computer used to sit.

BOURNE reaching suddenly under the desk. Bingo. Pulling out

a retractable computer keyboard tray. But it's empty. No

keyboard. Now he's really confused and --

INSERT -- A PHONE/ANSWERING MACHINE -- BOURNE pressing the

playback button and --

BOURNE leaving that for a moment -- about to anyway -- and

then he turns back -- new idea -- pressing for the speaker

phone -- and then hitting redial and --

THE PHONE stars dialing...

RINGING and...

BOURNE quick grabbing the receiver. Taking it off speakerphone

and --

BOURNE grabbing the backpack -- tearing through it -- where

is it? -- where is it? -- shit and money falling out and --

There it is -- from the safe-deposit box -- that piece of

card stock -- the one with no passport attached to it --

BOURNE waiting. And then there's muzak -- holding music and --

THE MASTER BATHROOM

Water running in the tub. MARIE pulling off her boots.

Checking the temperature.

THE OFFICE STUDY

Bourne still on hold. And then --

Silence. BOURNE is rocked. But the Manager, it's natural, he

interprets the silence as grief...

BOURNE just hands up the phone. Just like that. Not even

goodbye. Standing there frozen. Stunned. John Michael Kane

is dead. And he had the passport.

Suddenly, everything's changed. They shouldn't be here. This

is bad. Danger.

THE MASTER BATHROOM

MARIE playing with her hair in the mirror. Checking the water --

THE OFFICE

BOURNE frozen there. On alert. He forces a smile. Decoy mood.

THE KITCHEN

BOURNE moving to the sink. He's smiling. Upbeat. But it's an

act. His eyes are everywhere. Turning on the water. But

ignoring it. What he's really doing is searching out a weapon.

Pulling A KNIFE very quietly from behind the stove. Holding

it. Feels pretty comfortable. Hiding it down by his side. On

the move again, now --

BOURNE like we've ever seen him. Like an animal. Every sound --

every breeze -- everything carries information.

Standing still. Taking it all in.

Real quick layout -- there's big windows along one wall that

face out to the street below. The hallway to the bedroom and

bath feeds into the living room from one side. There is a

large frosted airshaft window along that hallway wall. Simple

furniture.

MARIE backing away -- completely freaked -- BOURNE standing

there with the knife in his hand and --

MARIE -- frightened -- confused -- paralyzed for a moment --

BOURNE glancing back -- a curtain fluttering behind him --

motioning for MARIE to get down -- do it -- now -- down!

MARIE hesitating and --

BOURNE -- what's he doing? -- he's unscrewing a lightbulb

from a lamp beside him and --

MARIE about to say something -- he shakes her off --

BOURNE -- knife in one hand -- lightbulb in the other --

putting his foot on a chair in front of him and --

BOURNE waving her to shut up -- crawl -- now -- back up --

get under the window -- go! --

MARIE -- he seems so sure -- it's weird, but she's doing it --

she's under that frosted window -- down below the sill --

looking back -- what the fuck is he doing now? --

BOURNE -- the lightbulb -- he's tossing it across the room --

over her head -- into that frosted window and --

As she ducks down --

As it SHATTERS --

EVERYTHING STARTS HAPPENING AT ONCE

PHFT!-PHFT!-PHFT!-PHFT!-PHFT!-PHFT! -- silenced automatic

weapons fire -- raking into the apartment and --

THE FROSTED WINDOW peppered with holes and --

MARIE on the floor as THE WINDOW SHATTERS above her and --

CASTEL -- he's in the airshaft! -- hanging from an abseil

rope -- but off guard -- FIRING BLIND -- strafing the

apartment and --

BOURNE kicking that chair across the room and --

CASTEL reacting -- instinct -- moving target --

THE CHAIR just strafed to shit and --

BOURNE rolling away and --

CASTEL -- he's coming in -- last pieces of window frame

CRASHING AWAY as he swings into the apartment and --

MARIE -- right below him -- shit raining down as he flies in

and --

BOURNE throwing the knife and --

CASTEL -- turning -- too late -- the knife catching him in

the neck and --

BOURNE -- in motion -- attacking and --

CASTEL -- knife impaled in his neck -- clawing for it with

one hand -- trying to get off a shot and --

APARTMENT WALL -- PHFT!-PHFT!-PHFT!-PHFT!-PHFT! -- gunfire

tearing wildly around the room and --

BOURNE -- full-stop -- kicking the gun -- kicking it up --

ROUNDS TEARING ACROSS THE CEILING and --

MARIE -- SCREAMING NOW -- trying to crawl away and --

CASTEL -- no chance -- off balance -- BOURNE -- his open

palm driving up into CASTEL'S JAW -- the body wants to fall

backward, but BOURNE has the guy's arm in his free hand --

jerking it like rope -- tearing it from it's socket and --

THE GUN CLATTERING FREE across the floor and --

BOURNE -- his knee -- like a piston -- hard into CASTEL'S

GUT -- and then down -- his foot -- down into CASTEL'S KNEE,

shattering it and --

CASTEL is on the floor -- stunned -- wiped -- knife pouring

blood from his neck -- arm hanging like a rag doll -- bone

torn through his pant leg above the knee and --

BOURNE ignoring her -- grabbing the guy's backpack --

CASTEL -- eyes wild -- tries to make his feet --

CASTEL -- crablike against a wall -- bloody hands leaving a

mess as he struggles to get to his feet --

CASTEL -- staring back -- eyes wild -- mouth shut -- his

expression -- is it terror or pure steel? --

MARIE -- the guy's backpack -- something in her hand -- and

as freaked out as she was a moment ago -- this is worse --

Now there's KNOCKING AT THE DOOR and --

MARIE is past the point of rationality and CASTEL is bleeding

and shaking and BOURNE is trying to think and it's just

impossible and --

Suddenly -- CASTEL is moving! -- and fast -- it's superhuman --

unbelievable -- just enough spring in his good leg and --

BOURNE bracing himself but --

CASTEL isn't attacking! -- he's running away -- he's crossing

the living room -- but there's nowhere to go -- absolutely

nowhere -- except --

THE WINDOW

CASTEL hurling himself into the glass and --

EXT. THE PARIS APARTMENT BUILDING -- DAY

WINDOW SHATTERING! -- CASTEL -- in a cloud of broken glass --

sixty feet above the street --

Falling and falling and...

IMPACT! -- landing on the roof of a parked car and --

INT. THE PARIS APARTMENT -- DAY

THE APARTMENT -- BOURNE in motion -- five things at once --

checking the window -- kicking the gun away -- grabbing the

red bag -- grabbing what he can -- no time to spare and --

MARIE standing there in utter shock -- paralyzed -- the

picture in her hand -- the broken glass -- all of what just

happened --

BOURNE -- that's it -- grabbing the backpack -- pulling it

on -- just about to make his move --

She's standing there. Just utterly swamped. Lost.

EXT. THE PARIS APARTMENT BUILDING -- DAY

A CROWD is gathered around CASTEL'S BODY. Rubberneckers and

people pointing up to the broken window -- THE CONCIERGE

running out to the street and getting the news and THE SOUND

OF SIRENS bleeding in from the distance and --

THE CAMERA PULLS BACK TO FIND

THE LITTLE RED CAR pulling out of the alley. Turning away

from the scene. Disappearing into the streets of Paris --

INT. WOMBOSI COMPOUND MAIN HALLWAY -- DAY

THRONE ROOM DOORS flying open -- WOMBOSI exploding out into

the hallway --

SIX KIDS -- TWO WIVES -- THREE BODYGUARDS -- all startled by

this steamrolling mass of energy and paranoia --

A MASSIVE ONE-TAKE TRACKING SHOT

DEAUVAGE on his feet -- racing to follow -- KIDS scattering

out of the way -- THE WIVES completely unfazed and --

WE'RE HEADING DOWN TO THE POOL

WOMBOSI stops to look at DEAUVAGE. In the background, we can

hear A CHILD CRYING by the pool --

WOMBOSI moving quickly now and WE'RE STILL TRACKING -- taking

him into --

THE POOL AREA

FORTY KIDS going nuts in the water. ONE KID crying. WOMBOSI

like a shot -- picking the kid up -- drying his tears --

making a funny face -- getting a smile as --

INT. GARE DU NORD -- DAY

BOURNE and MARIE stash the red bag in a locker.

INT. CIA PSYCHOACOUSTICS LAB -- DAY

AN ELECTRONICS CONSOLE. Super-tech. Meters -- LEDs -- wave-

form analyzers -- audio spectrum filters -- all of this gear

dancing and responding to every nuance of --

BOURNE'S VOICE -- OVER SPEAKERS -- we're listening to a

recording of the call he made from the apartment to the Hotel

Marbeouf Paris --

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

A secret studio buried deep in the Langley facility. Equipment

up the ass. Five people in this darkened room: AN ENGINEER

working the board. CONKLIN looking sour. ZORN in the shadows.

ABBOTT sitting there waiting for analysis from --

MRS. DOYLE. She's late sixties. A long-time spy shrink. An

eminence. A diamond-hard, seen-it-all intelligence.

MRS. DOYLE nods to THE ENGINEER. She's heard enough.

She turns. Battle lines drawn.

Silence. The idea dangling for a moment.

EXT. BELLVILLE CAR PARK -- DUSK

BOURNE and MARIE stashing the red car.

INT. CIA HALLWAY UPSTAIRS HALLWAY -- DAY

ABBOTT and CONKLIN walk and talk. They want to get loud, but

they can't. Too many people passing by --

EXT. HOTEL DE LA PRIX -- NIGHT

Funky. Out of the way. Cash and carry. No-questions-asked

kind of flop. Our establishing shot somehow includes THE

PROPRIETOR and HIS DOG.

INT. THE HOTEL ROOM BATHROOM -- NIGHT

HAIR DYE washing down a rusted drain. It's MARIE alone in

this crappy little bathroom. Jeans and bra. All of it soaking

wet.

A new hair color.

A MIRROR. There she is. Her turn to stare at herself and

wonder.

And then she smells something. Smoke...

INT. THE HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

It's a shitty little room. BOURNE sitting on the bed. And

the smoke is coming from...

HIS PASSPORT -- the Jason Bourne passport -- on fire. BOURNE

holding it as it burns away. Bourne's face -- melting --

bubbling -- finally disappearing, -- BOURNE letting go just

before it burns his fingers and --

BOURNE sits back. And there's MARIE standing there. And she's

holding out her passport --

He looks at her. Big moment.

He looks away. Silence. And then, she touches him. His

shoulder.

BOURNE almost recoils. Almost. He doesn't know what to do.

Doesn't know how to react.

MARIE in front of him now -- she's taking his hand -- and he

hesitates -- looking at her -- is this happening? -- she's

taking his hand -- moving it down her body -- staring at him --

both of them silent -- his hand -- her skin -- his mind racing --

he wants this -- wants it in every way -- but it's

overwhelming -- when was the last time something like this

happened? -- he can't remember -- he doesn't care -- he's

pulling her toward him -- and they're kissing -- and you

know the rest...

INT. CDG AIRPORT -- NIGHT

THE PROFESSOR arriving in Paris.  Coming through the terminal

as his pager goes off -- never even stopping as he reads and --

HOTEL SEQUENCE -- SKETCHED ONLY

HOTEL MARBOEUF PARIS. This is the place that answered the

phone when Bourne hit redial in his apartment. This is the

place that John Michael Kane was staying when he "died."

And so begins, the investigation...

Now, since the presence of danger -- ie Wombosi's guys and/or

Treadstone -- is still up in the air, and since this scene

could either play very quickly or very long, and since we're

not exactly sure where we stand with page count -- this scene

is not finished.

The rules of the scene, however, seem to be thus: Bourne

would have to be very nervous about being recognized. If he

was Kane and Kane stayed here, he's not the guy to do whatever

"social engineering" needs doing.

Long version? Bourne sets the table and Marie gets the goods.

Somehow there's a threat from Treadstone or Wombosi.

Fast version? It's all results -- we see them execute a plan

rather than work it up. MARIE is already in the hotel. In a

hotel uniform? Posing as a guest? In any case, she looks

very much different than we've ever seen her before.

She gets close to the office. Hides. Waits. BOURNE calls the

desk from a pay phone. Asks for something. We see that some

sort of improvised booby-trap has been set inside the hotel

to start a fire. In the confusion -- MARIE -- very bravely --

gets into the office. We do a quick cut outside to Bourne

waiting and --

EXT. STREET OUTSIDE THE HOTEL MARBOEUF -- DAY

Walk and talk. BOURNE and MARIE leaving the hotel fast. He's

on alert -- always on alert now -- making sure they're not

being watched. And she's excited and pumped -- she did it! --

she's got the hotel record in hand --

INT. AN EMPTY OFFICE SUITE -- DAY

Vacancy wasteland. Dead phone lines hanging. Carpet pulled

up. Completely stripped out. BOURNE and MARIE standing there

staring.

She turns around -- and what's he doing? -- BOURNE with a

piece of paper and pencil -- or something/anything resourceful

and handy -- maybe it's carpet lint -- maybe it's breaking

the glass on the door and holding it up to the light -- or a

rubbing -- anyway, he's doing something ingenious with the

glass door --

And as he's doing this, we're hearing --

We're watching the MPG LOGO emerge and seeing BOURNE and

MARIE react, as we hear --

INT./EXT. SHITBAG PARISIAN PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT

BOURNE on the pay phone. MARIE behind him at the bar. He's

got a pad and paper. This is all business.

Dial tone. BOURNE making a note. And as he does --

TIME CUT -- one minute later -- call number two --

TIME CUT -- one minute later -- call number three --

TIME CUT -- one minute later -- last call --

BOURNE hangs up. Scribbles down the number. Backing away and --

INT. TREADSTONE RESEARCH DESK -- NIGHT

CONKLIN and the RESEARCH TECHS jamming on the console --

CONKLIN turns and --

CONKLIN left hanging. ABBOTT clear on this one.

EXT. EST. SHOT -- LA DEFENSE -- DAY

Monolithic tech. Reflection city.

INT. ELEVATOR -- LA DEFENSE -- DAY

BOURNE dressed for success. Suit. Cleaned up good. Catching

his reflection in the elevator's mirrored ceiling. Nerves on

edge.

INT. OFFICE LOBBY -- DAY

ALLIANCE SECURITY MARITIME DIVISION. Glossy posters of yachts,

tankers and luxury sailboats. BOURNE standing there. Sucking

it up. God knows what he's walking into here and --

INT. ALLIANCE SECURITY -- DAY

A SECRETARY leading BOURNE through a suite of offices and

into --

INT. PETER RAWLINS' OFFICE -- DAY

Meet RAWLINS. He's a young, jolly Brit -- pink and overfed --

and quite shocked to see...

BOURNE just trying to feel his way through this...

A long awkward beat. Neither of them sure where to go.

Another beat. Rawlins holding back until now...

RAWLINS smiles. Reset. Sales mode.

INT. A CAFE NEAR LA DEFENSE -- DAY

BOURNE entering. And there's MARIE in the back working a

payphone -- waving for him to sit -- she's onto something.

BOURNE sits. Pulls out the Alliance Security Brochures and

literature. Flipping through it. Boats. Water. He's getting

closer. Pictures of yachts and various security blurbs and a

list of references for huge yachts -- jobs they've done in

the past...

INT. PARIS MORGUE FRONT DESK -- NIGHT

THE TWO MORGUE ATTENDANTS watching BOURNE put down a hundred

dollar bill. MARIE standing a little off -- she will not be

comfortable in the morgue.

BOURNE pulling out another hundred and --

MORGUE FREEZER ROOM

It's showtime. MARIE back by the door. BOURNE right on it.

ATTENDANT #1 pulling open the freezer and...

BOURNE sags. ATTENDANT #1 looking baffled.

INSERT -- FREEZER #121 -- it's empty.

Here comes the boss back from his break -- a little drunk?

Everybody following -- all of them confused -- and into --

FRONT DESK AREA

BOURNE there first -- all forward motion here -- balls out --

MARIE trying to take the hint, but she's curious what he's

doing --

But he's not writing -- he's ripping -- tearing the page out

of the book --

BOURNE just slammed him against the wall. Hard. Like a tractor

hit him. And fast.

And that shuts up the room.

THE TWO ATTENDANTS rushing to help their boss --

BOURNE grabbing MARIE and pulling her out the door --

EXT. PARIS STREET -- NIGHT

Moments after the morgue. BOURNE striding away. MARIE

struggling to keep up. And BOURNE is different now -- zoning

in -- he's close -- he's hardening --

BOURNE ignoring her -- ripping through the Alliance Security

brochures -- scanning them as he walks --

MARIE just stops. Reeling.

BOURNE walking away. Into Paris night and --

INT. CONKLIN'S TREADSTONE OFFICE -- DAY/NIGHT?

ABBOTT alone here. On the phone. Looking up to see --

ABBOTT jumps off the call. Eyes never leaving ZORN.

EXT. L'ETOILE -- NIGHT

THE PROFESSOR -- A MOTORCYCLE -- screaming through traffic

and --

INT. WOMBOSI'S SECURITY ROOM -- NIGHT

VIDEO MONITOR -- there's BOURNE -- staring up and --

INT. TREADSTONE RESEARCH DESK -- NIGHT

VIDEO MONITOR -- different angle -- more clandestine -- but

same deal -- there's BOURNE just standing there and --

EXT. WOMBOSI COMPOUND -- NIGHT

BOURNE live. On the street. Bathed in a streetlight. Staring

up at a security camera.

Total hero moment.

I'm here. I'm waiting. I know you're watching.

EXT. WOMBOSI COMPOUND -- NIGHT

Confusion to say the least -- WOMBOSI -- pistol in hand --

moving as fast as he can through the clutter -- KIDS

scattering as he follows DEAUVAGE -- racing for THE SECURITY

ROOM --

INT. TREADSTONE COMMUNICATIONS ROOM -- NIGHT

CONKLIN -- ZORN -- ABBOTT -- THE TECHS -- everyone plugged

into the tension here --

EXT. NEUILLY STREETS -- NIGHT

THE PROFESSOR on the speeding cycle -- closing in fast and --

EXT. WOMBOSI'S COMPOUND -- NIGHT

BOURNE standing there as the FRONT GATE opens. The moment.

The big deep breath. He's walking in --

INT. TREADSTONE COMMUNICATIONS DESK -- NIGHT

Uglier by the second -- desperation madness --

INT. WOMBOSI COMPOUND MAIN HALLWAY -- NIGHT

DEAUVAGE and BODYGUARD #1 giving BOURNE a serious pat down.

DEAUVAGE doesn't answer -- spinning BOURNE around -- they're

really going over him --

INT. TREADSTONE COMMUNICATIONS ROOM -- NIGHT

CONKLIN on his feet -- ABBOTT beet red -- this is getting

loud --

ABBOTT just shaking his head no.

And CONKLIN snaps -- suddenly he's over the console -- there's

the button -- and he's pressing it and --

EXT. NEUILLY ROOFTOPS -- NIGHT

THE PROFESSOR in position -- roof of the house next door --

hum -- hum -- hum --

It's the E-PHONE PAGER -- he's just been activated and --

INT. WOMBOSI'S COMPOUND HALLWAY -- NIGHT

BOURNE being marched toward the throne room doors -- DEAUVAGE

and BODYGUARD #1 flanking him -- KIDS and WIVES staring as

he passes -- the way you'd look at a prisoner on the way to

the gallows --

THE BIG DOORS thrown open wide and --

WOMBOSI on the throne.

BOURNE steps up to the plate.

KIDS have started sneaking into the room -- DEAUVAGE is trying

to scoot them out but --

BOURNE watching the kids -- they are all staring --

There is A BOMB on the throne now.

BOURNE -- caught off guard as -- WOMBOSI suddenly rips away

his jacket -- so hard that he tears straight through to the

shirt --

BOURNE'S BACK -- bare -- two bullet scars -- still raw --

BOURNE imploding -- this news -- the kids staring at him --

the bomb -- it's all getting loud around him --

BOURNE distracted by the kids -- these faces -- it's...

BOURNE not sure -- about any of it --

He doesn't have to say it twice -- they know the drill --

they're gone.

DEAUVAGE closing the doors and as he does --

THE PROFESSOR ATTACKS...

THIS SCENE HAS NOT BEEN WRITTEN

It's a shootout.

The Professor is infinitely more talented at this than the

bodyguards.

Bourne needs to get out of there -- without looking wimpy --

No children are harmed.

As the Professor rallies -- he will shoot Wombosi -- he will

find Bourne's jacket left on the floor (in which later he

will find a clue leading him to Belleville) and last but

hardly least, he will take a parting shot at the bomb still

sitting there on the throne.

There will be a huge, trailer-worthy explosion.

This might not want to be very long. There is an extensive

action sequence just around the corner.

So Bourne escapes. Physically he's just weary. Emotionally

he's fucked.

All of that happens and we cut to --

INT. TREADSTONE COMMUNICATIONS DESK -- NIGHT

CONKLIN flipping out -- THE PROFESSOR is not responding --

ABBOTT looks like he might puke. ZORN watching his career

burn to the ground around him.

CONKLIN grabbing shit -- like a madman --

CONKLIN splits and --

INT. THE HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT

It's really late. BOURNE enters the room. MARIE in the corner.

Smoked out. Cried out. Lifed out.

Silence. Not a word.

His shirt is torn to shit. He scraped-up -- blood here and

there. He moves past her into --

THE BATHROOM

His hands shaking as he tries to wash them. He bags it.

THE ROOM

BOURNE comes out. And there's a long silence until --

BOURNE nods. Turns off the light. Takes her hand. And they

lay in bed. Just laying there.

INT. PARIS SOMEWHERE -- NIGHT

THE PROFESSOR cooping somewhere. Tending to his wounds.

Ignoring his pager. He's slipped off the grid.

INT. HOTEL ROOM -- DAWN

BOURNE and MARIE packing up to hit the road. Together.

DOUG'S ROUGH DRAFT OF THE BIG ACTION SEQUENCE

INT. HOTEL DE LA PAIX -- LOBBY -- DAY

MARIE dropping off the key. Hope hangs in the air --

BOURNE enters. He's got the black duffel. Car keys.

And now they're headed for the door. Something doesn't feel

right for BOURNE -- and then he notices --

Bourne turns back to the CLERK.

Suddenly -- just like that -- everything's different --

Now MARIE doesn't need a second warning --

-- those words -- the way he said it -- she's grabbing her

purse, clearing out of the room. Slamming the door behind

her -- click -- it's locked.

No answer -- too busy -- reaching under the check-in desk,

coming up with -- A SHOT GUN, an old one, but nonetheless a

gun --

And now BOURNE is moving, pulling open a drawer.  A box of

shells. Filling his pockets.

And he is moving down the small hallway.  Away from the front

door -- towards the back door under the stairs.

EXT. HOTEL DE LA PAIX -- COURTYARD -- DAY

THE HOTEL BACK DOOR -- kicked open -- BOURNE coming out of

the house -- coming hard -- and --

The small courtyard is empty -- but now the ALARM is going

off -- and BOURNE turns back to MARIE -- races to grab her

as --

RATATATAT -- The FRONT DOOR -- WINDOWS -- ARE SHREDDED and --

here comes the PROFESSOR.

And now they are running, across this little courtyard. To a

wall -- BOURNE is up, on it -- reaching down for MARIE --

grabbing her -- swinging her over the wall as --

ABM!!! The PROFESSOR SHOOTS.

MARIE takes off running. BOURNE leans over the wall, FIRES

BACK TWICE -- RATATAT -- The WALL IS SHREDDED. BOURNE takes

off running -- reloading on the fly.

Rounds a bend, is chambering two rounds when he sees -- a

WOMAN is in her kitchen -- staring at him -- no time to

explain -- he turns back --

The PROFESSOR is just vaulting over the wall. BOURNE FIRES

TWICE -- BAM! BAM! But the spray is too wide from this

distance. Windows are shattered to both sides of him but --

the PROFESSOR stumbles but keeps going -- blood on his face

now -- RATATAT --

BOURNE has to move. Reloading his almost useless gun. Reaching

MARIE -- facing a choice and they climb a wall -- FLOWER

POTS EXPLODE around them but they make it -- now --

RUNNING IN A LABYRINTH -- right -- then left -- through a

small staircase. LEAPING a wall -- landing on a STEEP ROOF --

sliding, falling, crashing to the ground in --

A SMALL COURTYARD -- steep walls on all sides. But there's a

large window -- and it's open. And they step through and

find themselves --

INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT -- BATHROOM -- DAY

They close the window behind them -- catch their breath --

BOURNE shakes his head. Tucks the gun under his coat.

And now he is opening the door -- they step into --

INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT -- DAY

STARTLED KITCHEN WORKERS stare as BOURNE and MARIE calmly

walk out of the bathroom and head towards the front door of

the empty restaurant. Quiet.

And then they open the door to the street and --

EXT. BELLEVILLE -- COMMERCIAL STREET -- DAY

The first thing we notice is noise. The street is burgeoning

with life. The second thing we notice are SIRENS. POLICE

CARS approaching. BOURNE and MARIE head down the street,

blending in.

Up ahead -- TWO POLICE CARS snaking through traffic. BOURNE

steers them off this crowded street.

EXT. BELLEVILLE -- QUIET STREET -- DAY

And BOURNE and MARIE are hurrying down this street when --

BAM -- The PROFESSOR comes out of a building -- across and

down the street. No time to hide -- he's seen them -- he's

FIRING.

BOURNE tackles MARIE to the ground behind a car. RATATAT --

The PROFESSOR is literally shredding it. And now BOURNE is

moving --

And BOURNE is on the offensive. BAM! BAM! Moving towards the

PROFESSOR who is ducking behind cars on the other side.

They are shredding the street -- FIRING ruthlessly at each

other and -- NOW THE POLICE ARE HERE -- BLOCKING both ends

of the street. GUNS are drawn -- BOURNE's vulnerable on two

flanks. The COPS are YELLING. And now --

THE PROFESSOR BLASTS the COPS -- And now things have changed.

THREE WAY FIREFIGHT and BOURNE grabs MARIE and they dive

into --

INT. SMALL EPICERIE -- DAY

And the PROFESSOR shreds the store as BOURNE attemps to fire

back. SHIT flying everywhere in here -- hard to see and --

The PROFESSOR is advancing on them -- cops are no match for

his fire power. They move to the back -- kick open a door --

INT. HIGHWALLED COURTYARD -- DAY

BOURNE and MARIE cross this small courtyard, the PROFESSOR

is right on their heels. CRASH through a door -- and now

they are in --

INT. SMALL SWEATSHOP -- DAY

COUPLE of ASIAN WOMEN sewing in here. One MAN in charge --

and BOURNE and MARIE charging through -- the MAN about to

say something -- but now the PROFESSOR is on their tail and --

INT. SMALL AFRICAN SHOP -- DAY

Making god knows what in here -- vats of something. Small

grouping of workers -- BOURNE shutting the door behind him --

it's shredded with BULLET HOLES. BOURNE and MARIE racing to

the next door as -- BAM -- the PROFESSOR kicks the door open --

BOURNE about to fire -- but there is a WOMAN right behind

the PROFESSOR! Can't do it -- turns to run as -- RATATATAT --

The PROFESSOR FIRES as BOURNE and MARIE dive into --

INT. LIVE POULTRY SHOP -- DAY

And now CHICKEN feathers are flying everywhere -- the glass

at the front of the door is shattering. BOURNE and MARIE

make it through the gauntlet.

EXT. BELLEVILLE -- STREET -- DAY

And BOURNE and MARIE are running. And he is reaching into

his pocket -- fishing around -- and just as he pulls out the

car keys -- we recognize this as the street they parked their

car on and --

BY MARIE'S CAR

BOURNE unlocks the door -- pops MARIE's open. And --

THERE'S A COP -- yelling at them and -- BOURNE hits the gas --

they fly out of their parking space -- BAM!! The COP fires,

shattering their windshield and there -- up ahead -- THE

PROFESSOR coming out -- about to FIRE -- BOURNE aims for him --

forces him to dive out of the way and -- ONE QUICK MOVE around

a TRUCK and they are free.

INT. THE LITTLE RED CAR

BOURNE and MARIE looking back nervously -- so far all over --

ON THE STREET

The PROFESSOR looking around. PEOPLE staring at him -- covered

in blood -- the COP racing up -- yelling -- not yelling for

long because the PROFESSOR is firing at him and --

Now the PROFESSOR is moving -- not running -- just a swift

walk and now he's past the truck -- and --

A MOTORCYCLIST comes flying down the street -- oblivious --

going way too fast for these streets and -- the PROFESSOR

swings his gun stock like a bat -- takes him out -- clean

and smooth -- bike crashing to the ground and --

The PROFESSOR grabs the bike and takes off -- SHOOTING at

TWO POLICE CARS just racing to the scene and we are into --

EXT. BELLEVILLE BLVD -- DAY

HIGH SPEED CAR CHASE. And BOURNE better do some fancy driving

because here comes the PROFESSOR -- and he's a lot faster --

much better armed.

INT. MARIE'S CAR

BOURNE driving. MARIE looking back -- seeing the PROFESSOR

gain on them --

And -- THE PROFESSOR FIRES -- SHREDS the back off their car --

And now she's got his shotgun, leaning out the window.

BOURNE swerves, up on the sidewalk back onto the street --

slaloms through the traffic -- racing towards an intersection

and --

IN THE INTERSECTION

CARS coming the other way, BOURNE just makes it through --

the PROFESSOR tries to squeeze through -- skidding and --

CRACK! The PROFESSOR hits the front of a car sideways on his

bike -- he is THROWN clear through the intersection, right

into the windshield of an oncoming car and --

He gets up, grabs his gun and works his way towards his bike

and now we see --

EXT. VARIOUS SHOTS AROUND PARIS -- DAY

COPS are mobilizing -- swarming into this area and --

BACK TO THE CAR CHASE --

BOURNE and MARIE pick up a few cops on their tail -- shed

all of them -- the last car goes into an EXPLOSIVE FLIP --

the PROFESSOR is now right behind them. And now we are into --

CRAZY CAR CHASE WITH COPS RIGHT ON THEIR TAIL

BOURNE, MARIE and the PROFESSOR leave a trail of totaled

cars that the cops have to try and navigate through -- finally

saying fuck it and hitting a few cars themselves and now we

are into --

CAR CHASE THROUGH NARROW STREETS

MARIE'S CAR and the MOTORCYCLE can pass where the police

cars cannot. BOURNE may be able to shed the cops, but not

the PROFESSOR. And now one quick move and they are --

EXT. QUAI -- DAY

Racing against traffic up the Seine. Past the Louvre. COPS

pursuing on the other side of the river. BOURNE and the

PROFESSOR leaving behind a trail of carnage. And now --

The PROFESSOR is pulling up along side them -- one lane over.

Both swerving to avoid oncoming cars and --

MARIE FIRES -- TWICE -- TAKES out a few windshields. The

PROFESSOR fires at the same time -- MARIE'S CAR DOOR -- GONE --

she's totally exposed but --

THE PROFESSOR -- his BIKE is SPOUTING GAS -- one of the

pellets nailed his tank.

BOURNE AND MARIE --

THE PROFESSOR --

No problem -- he's unwrapping a piece of duct tape from the

barrel of his gun -- two seconds and the hole is patched and --

BOURNE AND MARIE -- the side of the car is completely gone --

the PROFESSOR is gaining -- across the river dozens of police

cars are racing alongside. Many more can be seen on their

side -- a road block ahead -- running out of options and --

BOURNE turns hard -- crashes over the sidewalk and flies

down a side street. A POLICE CAR pulls out behind them --

the PROFESSOR can't stop -- skidding hard, turning the bike

sideways, skidding out -- sliding across the ground and

BAMMM!!! SMASHING into a GLASS PHONE BOOTH which shatters.

And he's up -- lifting up his bike and --

BOURNE AND MARIE

SIX POLICE CARS on their tail -- more joining. Every street

they look down has POLICE CARS racing in parallel. Running

out of options and in the background --

THE PROFESSOR is back in the game -- passing the police cars

and up ahead --

THE ROAD IS BLOCKED. POLICE ROAD BLOCK -- cops with guns.

Gotta act quick and -- BOURNE turns hard left -- there's a

metro staircase -- only way out and --

THEY BOUNCE down the stairs. CRASH through the doors down

below.

THE FIRST POLICE CAR -- no way he's following. SLAMMING on

his brakes. SKIDDING to a halt -- SKIDDING sideways -- gonna

stop in time -- just at the edge of the steps and then --

THE SECOND POLICE CAR isn't braking -- T-BONES the first car --

BAM!!! -- sends it rolling sideways down the steps until it

crashes to a halt at the bottom -- upside down.

THE PROFESSOR -- he's turning -- heading for a different set

of stairs. BOURNE AND MARIE -- crashing through the turnstiles --

people diving out of their way and --

AT THE STAIRCASE -- THE WINDOW of the POLICE CAR is kicked

out and -- TWO VERY ANGRY COPS emerge -- pull their guns out --

head into the station. BOURNE and MARIE's world just got a

lot more dangerous and --

THE PROFESSOR is racing down the other staircase -- an up

escalator -- people diving out of the way as --

BOURNE and MARIE slalom through the station -- suddenly --

there's the PROFESSOR -- parallel corridor -- metal barricades

keep them separated. PROFESSOR FIRING.

UP AHEAD -- a horizon line -- BOURNE guns it -- a steep

staircase and -- THEY FLY down the steps -- landing on --

THE METRO PLATFORM

The PROFESSOR lands on the other side -- both racing down

the platform -- PROFESSOR tearing up the wall behind them

and -- HERE COMES A TRAIN -- on BOURNE and MARIE's side --

travelling the opposite way -- temporary refuge. Not for

long -- there's no way out on this end of the platform. They

skid to a halt -- just as --THE TRAIN DOORS OPEN -- STARTLED

STRAPHANGERS stare at BOURNE and MARIE as they stop onto the

platform -- take off running.

THE PROFESSOR has to turn his bike around. He's quick -- but

it gives BOURNE and MARIE a two second head start.

BOURNE AND MARIE almost at the other end of the platform --

gunfire ripping up the windows behind them. Gonna go for the

steps -- but here come --

THE ANGRY COPS -- remember them? -- the ones who took the

ride down the steps -- they're firing now and --

BOURNE AND MARIE turn back -- the PROFESSOR is firing and

there is only one option --

INT. METRO CAR -- DAY

BOURNE and MARIE into the conductor booth. People diving off

the train as BOURNE hits the YELLOW BUTTON and -- the TRAIN

STARTS ROLLING -- doors still open -- they disappear into

the protection of the tunnel walls -- then BOURNE hits the

button to close the doors and -- THE PROFESSOR -- watching

the trains accelerate out of the station -- and now he's

racing his bike down the platform -- opposite the motion of

the train and -- here comes the end of the train and --THE

PROFESSOR throws his bike into a skidding 180 and skids off

the platform all in one move -- landing hard on the tracks

but facing the right direction and now he's accelerating

towards the train -- just as an oncoming train is racing

into the station and -- HE LEAPS onto the back of the train

in the nick of time. His GUN CLATTERS to the tracks.

IN THE LAST METRO CAR

The window is shattered and the PROFESSOR lets himself in --

wind whipping through his hair from the shattered windows.

And --

IN THE FIRST METRO CAR

BOURNE and MARIE finally getting a breather. BOURNE keeps

looking back -- nothing -- the train is deserted. Finally --

And ahead -- daylight -- the train tracks go above ground

and as the train hits daylight -- we see the PROFESSOR

directly behind BOURNE on the other side of the glass and --

CRASH! The PROFESSOR grabs BOURNE through the glass, ramming

his head into the metal as --

BOURNE grabs the knob, swings the door open and CRUSHES the

PROFESSOR -- CRUSHES him again and now he is free and --

BOURNE turns, pulls up the shotgun and -- the PROFESSOR kicks

it out of his hands -- it clatters to the ground and now we

have a beat -- THE TRAIN CAR races across the Bir Hakeim

bridge -- all of Paris laid out behind them. BOURNE and the

PROFESSOR squaring off -- both looking at the gun -- realizing

there's no chance for either one of them to get it and --

A BRUTAL RUTHLESS FIGHT breaks out. BOURNE's motivated --

the PROFESSOR's crazy -- makes it a pretty even match. Looks

like it could go on for a little while when suddenly --

BAM!!! The PROFESSOR drops to the ground -- behind him --

MARIE wields the shot gun.

And BOURNE takes the gun from her -- standing there --

reloading -- both barrels -- raising the gun -- aiming it --

INT. MOVING METRO CAR -- DAY

THE PROFESSOR sitting there. Like a dummy. Like a puppet

that's been propped up. He's fucked -- his whole side ravaged

with shot -- his arm shredded -- hand barely there -- blood

flowing fast --

THE PROFESSOR staring up at the gun. Stunned. Doomed. Mouth

dry. Eyes struggling to make sense of the chaos.

BOURNE lowering the weapon -- head swimming --

He's losing blood fast -- things inside him seizing up --

THE PROFESSOR -- coughing -- a spasm -- helpless --

And he's gone. Like that. Sitting there. And BOURNE looks

paralyzed too. Kneeling there. Stalled out.

BOURNE doesn't answer -- can't, because there's this sound --

this pulsing hum -- BOURNE reaching into THE PROFESSOR'S

POCKET and --

INSERT -- THE E-PHONE PAGER -- covered in blood -- hum --

hum -- hum -- BOURNE'S HAND wiping at the blood that covers

the display --

BOURNE staring at it. Very familiar to him.

INT. METRO CAR -- DAY

BOURNE and MARIE racing back through the cars -- away from

the scene of the crime and --

EXT. ABOVE-GROUND METRO PLATFORM -- DAY

THE SHATTERED TRAIN pulling into the station -- doors opening --

SCREAMS ECHOING through the station from up the platform and --

BOURNE and MARIE getting off the last car and --

EXT. STREET/ALLEY NEAR THE PLATFORM -- DAY

Two minutes later. BOURNE and MARIE -- exhausted -- beat --

Everything all at once --

She turns. He's holding the locker key.

But she doesn't move.

She takes it. Staring at him. Simply refusing to cry.

MARIE takes one last look. And she's running --

BOURNE hangs there a moment -- listening to her go -- and

then he pulls out THE E-PHONE PAGER. And it's pulsing like

crazy.

BOURNE flips open the shell. There's a keypad in there.

Holding it. Like a missing organ.

INT. THE ZURICH AIRPORT MOTEL ROOM -- DAY

Remember MANHEIM? He's still there waiting. And his pager

goes off, and --

INT. TREADSTONE PARIS -- NIGHT

A safehouse -- CONKLIN filling a burn bag -- racing --

everything's going --

EXT. TREADSTONE PARIS -- NIGHT

CONKLIN done with the dirty work -- out into the street --

As he's about to leave -- he hears a sound -- a familiar

sound -- hum -- hum -- hum --

He cross the street -- looks down to the Quai below --

Holy shit -- there's one of his E-PHONE PAGERS --

He goes down -- picks it up --

And now --

CONKLIN wheels around. There he is. Right behind him.

So now you know.

BOURNE showing nothing -- or is he trying too hard not to?

And with that, BOURNE scrambles up a wall -- like it's nothing --

CONKLIN just left there -- on the Quai -- in the dark --

EXT. BANKS OF THE SEINE -- NIGHT

BOURNE walking away -- faster and faster --

EXT. BANKS OF THE SEINE NEARBY -- NIGHT

MANHEIM -- A CAR PARKED IN THE DARKNESS -- sitting alone

with his briefcase. Opening it. There's his gun.

BOURNE -- walking -- deeper into the darkness and --

MANHEIM -- in the dark car -- loading the weapon -- calm --

steady -- methodical and --

BOURNE -- walking and --

MANHEIM -- stepping out of the car -- closing the door quietly --

deep in the shadows and --

BOURNE -- still coming -- the darkest part of the path just

ahead and --

MANHEIM -- raising the gun and --

THE CAMERA SPINS TO HIS TARGET AND --

IT'S CONKLIN! -- just climbing back up from the Quai --

MANHEIM -- the gun -- phftt -- phftt -- phftt --

CONKLIN -- three holes -- head -- heart -- gut -- his body

dropping like a stone beside his car.

MANHEIM walks over. Looks down. Point blank -- phftt -- that

makes it four and --

INT. TREADSTONE COMMUNICATIONS DESK -- NIGHT

ABBOTT and ZORN alone in the dark. As a red light begins

pulsing on the console.

That red light means Conklin's dead.

After a moment, ZORN moves to the console and shuts the light

off.

EXT. BANKS OF THE SEINE -- NIGHT

BOURNE still walking. And he's just gonna keep on going, as

we --

INT. CIA OPERATIONS CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY

MARSHALL at the head of the table. A cadre of INTEL HONCHOS.

ABBOTT in the hot seat. ZORN right there beside him.

ZORN handing ABBOTT the next hundred pages.

ABBOTT is just gonna go on and on and on.

EXT. MARTHA'S VINEYARD -- DAY

Gorgeous Summer day. A SCOOTER RENTAL SHACK near the beach.

SIX MONTHS LATER

MARIE coming out of the shack with two helmets. Handing them

to A HAPPY COUPLE waiting there on their scooters.

THE HAPPY COUPLE rides off.

MARIE turns back and --

There's BOURNE. A new look. A smile.

Beat. He smiles.

Her turn to smile. And we...
