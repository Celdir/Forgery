MUSIC: DEF LEPPARD - "ROCK ROCK (TILL YOU DROP)"

Over OPENING CREDITS, a montage of OLD WRESTLING-MAGAZINE

PHOTOS. Action shots of RANDY "THE RAM" ROBINSON taking on a

keffiyeh-wearing heel named THE AYATOLLAH before 20,000

screaming fans at Madison Square Garden.

The sounds of a SCREAMING, CHEERING CROWD overwhelm us. Over

the images, RINGSIDE ANNOUNCERS boom commentary:

----"Oh, my! Ram hit with a devastating piledriver!"

----"I've never seen a guy get fired into a buckle that hard!"

----"The Ayatollah taking it to The Ram outside the ring!"

----"Ram absorbing tremendous punishment! How much more can he

take?"

----"Wait a minute... Look at this... The Ram is getting up!"

----"He's coming back! I don't believe it!"

----"Suplex!"

----"Powerbomb!"

----"Randy The Ram Robinson giving absolutely everything he's

got! This is the very definition of heart!"

----"Just listen to this crowd! The entire Garden, 20,000

people, are on their feet!"

----"Ram climbing to the top rope... The crowd going wild...

They know what's coming..."

A PHOTO of Randy standing on the top rope, his bent arms

pressed against the sides of his head like RAM'S HORNS.

----"Uh-oh, the horns are out... Here it comes..."

We FREEZE on a final image of Randy FLYING HIGH ABOVE THE

CANVAS, horns out, poised to crash down on The Ayatollah.

----"Ram Jam! Lights out!!"

Over this, the sound of the crowd GOING CRAZY.

The Def Leppard song rings out as we...

INT. EAST WILMINGTON HIGH SCHOOL - LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

Present day. Post-match. Randy, pushing 50, still with the

same long, dyed-blond mane, sits on a bench in the boys

locker room of a Wilmington, Delaware high school.

CHYRON: 20 YEARS LATER

He pulls off his purple spandex wrestling tights. Lime-green

ram's horns run up the sides. They're the same kind of tights

as in the `80s pics----and may well be the actual same pair.

Naked except for a jockstrap, Randy takes a breath. Achy,

sweaty, saggy, exhausted. A battered warrior. Scars all over

his body. Despite the rough shape he's in, it's clear he's

just given it his all in the ring. He swigs down a few pills

with a beer.

Promoter SCOTT BRUMBERG, a heavyset man in a Mets jersey with

BRUMBERG - 44 on the back, approaches.

He hands Randy some cash. Randy counts it. It's not much.

Randy just shrugs resignedly.

EXT. EAST WILMINGTON HIGH SCHOOL - SHORT TIME LATER

Randy, changed into his street clothes, limps out of the

school, each step labored and painful. Waiting near the

entrance are TWO FANS, both men in their 30s.

Fan #1 holds out a SHARPIE and an old WRESTLING PROGRAM from

the `80s. On the cover is a shot of Randy wrestling CORPORAL

PUNISHMENT, a heel in a drill instructor get-up.

Randy takes the program, happy to oblige.

Randy hands back the program. FAN #2 hands him a MINI-POSTER.

The faded, mid-'80s poster features Randy, biceps bulging,

crushing a head of broccoli between his fists. Across the

top, it says "EAT YOUR VEGETABLES, PUNK!"

Randy smiles a little. He remembers, too. He hands back the

poster. Fan #2 looks fondly at Randy, a part of his boyhood.

Randy nods, a bit uncomfortably. The two fans, muttering

thanks, drift off into the Delaware night. Randy is left

standing alone, still holding Fan #1's pen.

He walks over to a beat-up old CONVERSION VAN and climbs in.

Turns on the engine. Music starts up on the stereo mid-song.

MUSIC: CINDERELLA - "DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU GOT (TIL IT'S GONE)"

INT. VAN - SHORT TIME LATER

Randy is driving. On the dashboard is an old ACTION FIGURE OF

HIMSELF from his WWF days. On the stereo, a different song

plays, later in the same album.

MUSIC: CINDERELLA   - "FIRE AND ICE"

Randy pulls into the entrance gate of PARADISE OAKS TRAILER

PARK.

EXT. PARADISE OAKS - RANDY'S TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER

Randy parks in front of his TRAILER. He gets out and heads

toward it. A dismayed look comes over his face.

RANDY'S POV: The door is PADLOCKED.

He tugs on the lock. Tugs on the door. No dice.

He violently kicks the padlock in a moment of rage.

EXT. RANDY'S TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER

Randy resignedly climbs into the BACK OF HIS VAN.

INT. BACK OF VAN - LATER

Randy lies on a scrunched-up mattress on the floor, unable to

sleep.

The van wall is decorated with a MINI-SHRINE Randy has built

to himself. Old magazine and newspaper clippings, mini-

posters, etc. A few changes of clothes lie in a messy heap in

the corner.

He grabs a bottle of pills and pops a few, washing them down

with a beer. He closes his eyes, trying to unwind.

INT. BACK OF VAN - NEXT MORNING

Randy is asleep in his clothes from the night before. He's

STIRRED AWAKE by the sound of kids YELLING and BANGING on the

outside of van.

He slowly sits upright, massaging his pain-wracked knees.

Every inch of him feels like shit.

RANDY'S POV: Through the front windshield, TWO 8-YEAR-OLD

KIDS, boosted by TWO OTHER KIDS, are peering in.

EXT. PARADISE OAKS - SHORT TIME LATER

Randy is playfully tussling with the four kids. He picks one

of them up and "bodyslams" him.

He picks up another one and fake-drops him on his head.

He slams a third one. The kids are squealing with delight.

Randy sees a car drive up and park by the MANAGER'S OFFICE.

He watches it with interest.

The kids moan with disappointment as Randy heads off.

INT. MANAGER'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Randy glares at Len, the trailer park's MANAGER.

Randy sigh-groans in frustration.

Len looks at Randy. A wave of pity comes over him.

EXT. PARADISE OAKS - IN BACK - EVENING

Randy sits on a MILK CRATE by his parked van. On the ground

in front of him is a BLENDER connected to an extension cord

stretching to another TRAILER. He pours a protein-shake

packet into the blender.

The trailer door opens. A WOMAN comes out. Lighting a

cigarette, she looks up at the cloudless, starry sky.

She gives Randy a small "You got it" wave.

EXT. SHOP-RITE SUPERMARKET - DAY

Randy enters a suburban Shop-Rite.

INT. SHOP-RITE - SHORT TIME LATER

Randy sticks his head in a door marked MANAGER'S OFFICE.

INT. WAYNE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Sitting behind a desk is store manager WAYNE (40). He looks

up at Randy, irked.

Wayne casually clicks a porn site closed on his computer.

Randy steps out and closes the door behind him. He knocks.

Randy enters.

Randy groans privately. He really hates Wayne.

Randy is not amused. Wayne grabs a LOOSELEAF BINDER.

Wayne starts flipping through.

EXT. SHOP-RITE - REAR LOADING DOCK - DAY

Randy, working alongside some MEXICAN GUYS, lifts a STACK OF

BOXES off the back of a BOAR'S HEAD DELIVERY TRUCK.

He carries the boxes through a RUBBER-STRIP CURTAIN, into a

WALK-IN COOLER. He puts them down and heads back out again.

INT. OGDEN'S GYM - LOCKER ROOM - DAY

Randy stands with GREGG, a huge bodybuilder who's counting

off some bills. Randy growls with displeasure at the small,

liquid-filled GLASS BOTTLE in his hand.

ANGLE ON bottle: The label says SUSTANON 250. The rest of the

label is in SPANISH.

Randy steps in front of Gregg's locker and starts ROOTING

AROUND.

Randy finds a bottle with GERMAN WRITING on it.

Randy puts the bottle of Mexican sustanon in the locker and

walks off with the German.

INT. LOCKER ROOM - TOILET STALL - SHORT TIME LATER

Randy, underwear pulled down, plunges a needle into his ass

cheek.

INT. GYM FLOOR - SHORT TIME LATER

Randy is BENCHPRESSING. He grunts loudly as he squeezes out

one more rep, his SPOTTER urging him on.

INT. SUNSATIONS TANNING SALON - LATER

A strip-mall tanning salon. Randy breezes in, nodding hello

to the FRONT-DESK WOMAN, who's on the phone.

INT. SUNSATIONS TANNING SALON - SHORT TIME LATER

ANGLE ON an upright tanning pod. INSIDE THE POD, Randy is

standing naked, baking under the UV lights.

INT. LOOKING GOOD HAIR & NAILS - SHORT TIME LATER

Randy sits in a chair as a KOREAN LADY wearing latex gloves

BLEACHES HIS ROOTS. His hair is full of plastic clips.

INT. VAN - DAY

MUSIC: GREAT WHITE - "ONCE BITTEN TWICE SHY"

Randy is driving along Route 21. "Once Bitten Twice Shy" is

blasting on the stereo. One hand on the wheel, he bangs out

the song's piano riff on the dash with the other.

He passes Cheetah's, a STRIP CLUB. He keeps an eye on it as

he drives past.

The song fades out. He pops the tape out of the deck and

tosses it on the passenger seat. On it is a messy pile of old

cassettes. Skid Row. Motley Crue. AC/DC. Guns `N' Roses. He

sifts through the selection, one eye on the road.

INT. VAN - SHORT TIME LATER

MUSIC: AC/DC - "BACK IN BLACK"

Randy is still driving. AC/DC's "Back In Black" cranks loud.

He pulls into the parking lot of a VFW HALL and parks.

INT. PASSAIC VFW HALL - CAFETERIA - SHORT TIME LATER

A makeshift locker room/staging area. Randy and 20 or so

other WRESTLERS stand before the event's sleazy, tracksuit-

clad promoter, NICK VOLPE.

Volpe walks off.

INT. CAFETERIA - SHORT TIME LATER

Randy sits alone a table toward the back. He takes a roll of

athletic tape out of his supplies-filled WHEELIE TRAVEL BAG.

He starts WRAPPING HIS KNEES AND ANKLES. He does it in a

slow, methodical manner. It feels almost ritualistic.

INT. CAFETERIA - SHORT TIME LATER

Randy is hashing out the match with his opponent, a wiry

Puerto Rican kid whose shiny vinyl pants identify him as KID

LOCO (22).

Kid Loco nods, listening closely, deferential to the legend.

Randy turns and sees fellow wrestler LEX LETHAL sticking his

head into the cafeteria door.

INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE CAFETERIA - MOMENTS LATER

Randy emerges from the cafeteria. A look of PLEASED SURPRISE

comes over his face.

RANDY'S POV: Standing there in an otherwise empty hallway is

a plain-ish YOUNG WOMAN (22). She looks at him with an

unsmiling expression. This is STEPHANIE.

Randy pulls her in for a hug. She doesn't really hug back.

She steps back, breaking off the hug. A brief, awkward pause.

She shakes her head no.

She is irked by his jokiness.

Stephanie gathers herself. This isn't easy for her.

Randy is puzzled for a moment. Then, it clicks in.

She smile-nods insincerely.

Stephanie is irked by his lack of engagement. She looks at

him with suspicion.

Randy turns and sees TWO MEATHEAD FANS down the hall, headed

his way.

MEATHEAD #1 gives Randy an excited high-five.

Psyched "Yeah!"s from the meatheads. Stephanie is pissed at

the interruption. And, even more, Randy's embrace of it.

The two meatheads flank Randy, their arms around his broad

shoulders. Meathead #1 looks tentatively at Stephanie,

holding up his DIGITAL CAMERA.

She coldly takes it.

She looks into the camera. The meatheads stick their tongues

out and throw up devil signs. Randy flexes theatrically,

making his best "Aaargh!" wrestling face.

Stephanie snaps a shot. Meathead #1 takes back his camera. He

and his buddy pat Randy heartily on the back.

The meatheads excitedly head off.

Randy turns his attention back to Stephanie, who's glaring at

him with cold disgust.

She looks at him calmly. Sadly.

She walks off.

INT. THE RING - SHORT TIME LATER

Randy SMASHING KID LOCO IN THE FACE with a flying drop-kick.

Kid Loco falls to the canvas.

Randy struts around the ring, exhorting the crowd, soaking up

their cheers.

Distracted, Randy doesn't notice Kid Loco peeling himself off

the mat. Kid Loco sneaks up behind Randy and SMASHES HIM IN

THE HEAD. Randy goes down.

Kid Loco lifts Randy up. They're both on their knees, chest-

to-chest. Kid Loco steps to his feet, lifting Randy with him.

Kid Loco tightens around Randy's arms, arches his back,

presses out his chest and... WHAM!! He and Randy fly with a

LATERAL DROP. Randy's head hits the canvas hard as he slams

down on his back.

As Randy writhes on the mat, Kid Loco HEADS FOR THE

TURNBUCKLE.

RANDY'S POV: Kid Loco is untying the turnbuckle's padded

cover.

Randy, clutching his back, discretely reaches into the

waistband of his tights and pulls out a RAZOR BLADE. He tucks

the blade between two fingers in his cupped palm.

Kid Loco heads back to Randy. He picks up him by the hair and

drags him to the turnbuckle, throwing him HEAD-FIRST into the

exposed metal post beneath.

Randy, clutching his smashed head, discretely runs the blade

along his hairline. No one sees it happen.

BLOOD STREAMS DOWN Randy's forehead. The crowd's ELECTRIFIED.

Kid Loco slams Randy's head into the metal post again. Again.

Randy slumps over the corner ropes. Kid Loco cockily struts

around the ring.

ANGLE ON Randy. The taunting stirs something in him. A look

comes over him, like he's Bruce Banner about to become the

Hulk.

Kid Loco saunters back over to Randy. He grabs his head for

another post smash, but HE CAN'T. Randy's neck and arm

muscles bulge. His neck veins pop like he's suddenly super-

charged.

A look of FEAR comes over Kid Loco. He knows the tide is

about to turn.

Randy reaches over his shoulder and grabs Kid Loco by the

hair. He pulls him in close.

Randy juts his hips back and bends over, gaining the leverage

he needs for a throw. Kid Loco shakes his head, begging no.

Randy straightens his legs, raises his lower back, and yanks

down on Kid Loco's head. Kid Loco's feet fly off the canvas

as his head gets BURIED INTO THE MAT. He gets stuck UPSIDE

DOWN with his feet over the ropes.

Randy, holding onto the top rope with both hands, thrusts his

knee into Kid Loco's stomach. Again. Again.

Kid Loco somehow manages to untangle himself from the ropes.

He scurries away. Randy goes after him.

Randy hits Kid Loco with everything he's got. Dropkicks.

Elbows. Bodyslams. He pours it on, unstoppable.

Randy drags Kid Loco into the middle of the ring. He looks

out at the crowd.

RANDY'S POV: A trio of fans are chanting.

Randy cups his hand to his ear. The chant quickly spreads.

Randy "mulls" it over. He looks at his laid-out foe. He looks

at the corner. He heads for the corner.

Randy climbs to the top rope. He looks around at the crowd

like he's still undecided.

RANDY'S POV: The fans are cheering, wild with anticipation.

Randy bends his arms, pressing them against the side of his

head like ram's horns. (Just like in the photo in the opening

montage.)

He LEAPS.

The leap is not terribly high or graceful. He crashes down

onto Kid Loco horns-first. Kid Loco's whole body convulses.

The fans lose it. This is what they wanted. The Ram Jam. The

money shot.

INT. CAFETERIA - LATER

Randy, on a post-match high, sits on a cafeteria table

enjoying a beer as a pseudo-MEDIC stitches up his hairline

gash. Nick Volpe wanders over.

Randy smiles contentedly. He sure did.

Nick Volpe comes over.

Randy looks at him, unsure.

Randy racks his brains. He has no idea.

Randy sees an excited smile creep across Volpe's face.

Randy is instantly intrigued.

Randy's mouth is practically watering.

EXT. CHEETAH'S - PARKING LOT - SHORT TIME LATER

A spring in his hobbled step, Randy gets out of the van and

heads toward Cheetah's, the strip club he passed earlier.

Manning the door is BIG CHRIS, a huge bouncer/doorman.

They chummily shake hands. Big Chris pulls Randy in tight.

INT. CHEETAH'S - SHORT TIME LATER

MUSIC: BIRDMAN & LIL WAYNE - "STUNTIN' LIKE MY DADDY"

A crowded, not-very-glamorous Jersey strip club. Randy stands

over by the bar. The female BARTENDER slides him a beer.

Randy takes a swig, looking around the club.

Randy, nodding, takes his beer and heads over toward the

STAGE. He settles in at an open table.

ON STAGE:

A YOUNG STRIPPER (22) works the pole, grinding lewdly to

"Stuntin' Like My Daddy", a bass-heavy Dirty South rap song.

RANDY:

Randy, watching her, quickly grows bored. He finds the

stripper, like the song, crude and soulless.

INT. CHEETAH'S - MEN'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Randy is at the urinal. He flushes and heads over to the

sink. He washes his hands, checking his look in the mirror.

He primps a little.

INT. CHEETAH'S - MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Randy exits the bathroom and heads back toward the table. En

route, he passes a curtained-off VIP ROOM.

Randy, hearing this, slows.

Randy peeks through the curtain. Inside, he sees CASSIDY

(36), a sexy, tattooed, aging rocker chick in a white spandex

dress. With her are six hair-gelled, goombah-wannabe BACHELOR-

PARTY DUDES (early 20s). The BACHELOR is sitting in a chair

in the middle.

Stifled laughter from his buddies.

OTHER SIDE OF CURTAIN:

Randy's anger builds as he watches.

VIP ROOM:

Cassidy, trying to salvage the gig, straddles the bachelor.

This cracks his friends up. Randy BURSTS THROUGH THE CURTAIN.

Everyone is taken aback, including Cassidy.

Cassidy wedges herself between Randy and Dude #2.

He turns to the bachelor.

Dude #1 steps to Randy, chest puffed out. Randy whips around

and GRABS THE CHAIR OUT FROM UNDER THE BACHELOR. He wields it

menacingly at Dude #1, who backpedals, terrified.

Randy makes like he's going to hit the guy with the chair.

Instead, he FLINGS IT AT THE WALL.

Jesus!!                         What the FUCK!!

The entire bachelor party rushes for the curtain. Just like

that, they're GONE.

Randy looks at Cassidy, expecting a hearty thank you. Instead

he gets a PISSED-OFF SHOVE.

Randy is totally taken aback.

Randy looks down, silent and sheepish.

Cassidy calms down a little.

She looks at him with a warm smile.

INT. CHEETAH'S - SHORT TIME LATER

MUSIC: KHIA - "MY NECK, MY BACK"

Randy is getting a LAPDANCE from Cassidy. She plants her

hands against the mirrored wall behind him, her body just

inches from his face.

She turns, giving him a nice view of her writhing behind. On

the small of her back is an AC/DC TATTOO.

Cassidy turns around again. Randy looks her body up and down,

savoring her curves as she dances just for him.

Cassidy smiles a little. This makes her feel good.

"My Neck My Back" ENDS. Cassidy pulls back on her dress and

casually sits down next to him. A new song comes on.

MUSIC: PITBULL - "UNA MANO LAVA LA OTRA"

They look toward the stage, where a PUERTO RICAN STRIPPER

shakes her ass to the staccato, abrasive Latin rap song.

Cassidy nods supportively, sincerely.

An ALARMED LOOK comes over Cassidy's face.

Randy follows her eyes to his HAIRLINE.

A small amount of BLOOD is trickling down from his stitches.

He grabs a COCKTAIL NAPKIN and casually dabs it.

Randy proudly holds out his arm.

CASSIDY'S POV: A long-ish SCAR on Randy's bicep.

He pulls down his shirt collar, revealing a nasty COLLARBONE

SCAR.

Cassidy stands up and straddles him, gazing soulfully at the

scar.

Randy contemplates the quote. He likes it.

Randy shrugs no.

She sits down next to him again.

Cassidy lightly traces a finger along Randy's bicep scar.

The Pitbull song ends. A new song begins.

MUSIC: MOTLEY CRUE - "GIRLS GIRLS GIRLS"

Cassidy stands up.

Randy reaches into a pocket and pulls out some bills.

Randy peels off three $20s and hands them to her.

Randy just smiles. She gives him a small peck on the cheek

and heads off.

THE STAGE:

Cassidy BURSTS ONTO THE STAGE. She owns it with rock `n' roll

energy.

ON RANDY:

ANGLE ON Randy's face as he enjoys the dance.

INT. VAN - DAY

Randy is driving over the Throgs Neck Bridge.

EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - SHORT TIME LATER

The van pulls up to a TWO-FAMILY HOUSE in working-class

Queens. Out steps Lex Lethal (from the Passaic VFW show).

INT. VAN - SHORT TIME LATER

Randy heads down a highway entrance ramp, Lex Lethal riding

shotgun.

Randy merges into traffic on the Long Island Expressway.

Randy chuckles cynically.

INT. DOLLAR TREE - SHORT TIME LATER

A Long Island strip-mall 99-CENT STORE. Randy and Lex browse

an aisle. Randy is holding a TIN CAKE PAN. He bangs it

against his forehead, testing it out. It makes a LOUD CLANG.

Lex takes the pan, testing it against his own head.

Lex spots something exciting on another shelf.

He grabs a pack of STEEL-WOOL PADS. Randy nods in approval.

Lex tosses them into the SHOPPING BASKET Randy is holding.

ANGLE ON basket. It's full of all sorts of "supplies": cookie

trays, lightbulbs, thumbtacks, cheese graters, wire hangers,

cutlery sets, pizza cutters, etc.

They head off in search.

INT. NORTH BABYLON COMMUNITY CENTER - GYM - LATER

MUSIC: AC/DC - "IF YOU WANT BLOOD (YOU GOT IT)"

Randy stands BEHIND A CURTAIN as his entrance song plays. He

sneaks a peek through it.

RANDY'S POV: A ROWDY CROWD of about 150 fills a COMMUNITY-

CENTER GYM. The vibe of the crowd is a bit rougher than

previous events. A banner on the wall reads ECHW - EAST COAST

HARDCORE WRESTLING. Pressed against the outside of the ring

are a FOLDING TABLE and a 12-FOOT METAL LADDER.

THE RING:

An ANNOUNCER stands with a microphone.

BEHIND THE CURTAIN:

Randy stands quiet and peaceful, head lowered slightly.

THE GYM:

Randy explodes into the gym, full of fire and showmanship.

He does a lap around the outside of the ring. His hand is

raised high in the air, index finger and pinky curled into a

set of RAM'S HORNS. Fans do the same.

Kids rush toward Randy, reaching out for HIGH FIVES. He

obliges as many as he possibly can.

Fans hold out FOLDING CHAIRS in front of him. (Just like in

the opening montage.) He "rams" each one with his forehead.

He does a lap around the perimeter of the ring,

enthusiastically head-butting chairs the whole way.

Randy climbs into the ring. He does a few neck rolls and knee

bends, limbering up.

The song fades down. A new song rises...

MUSIC: CELTIC FROST - "DOMAIN OF DECAY"

Ugly, plodding HARDCORE DEATH METAL.

The boos begin to rain down.

Through the curtain, HELLBILLY CANNIBAL emerges. A huge,

overalls-clad, mangy, wild-eyed masochist. Crumbs cling to

his scraggly beard. He's dragging a heavy CANVAS SACK.

A TEENAGER in the crowd holds up a sign reading HELLBILLY

CANNIBAL SUCKS A FAT DICK.

Hellbilly Cannibal climbs into the ring with his sack and a

folding chair. He heads to the center of the ring, where

Randy awaits.

They sit down on chairs facing each other. Under Hellbilly

Cannibal's chair is his canvas sack. Under Randy's is his

Dollar Tree plastic shopping bag.

Hellbilly Cannibal punches Randy. Randy punches Hellbilly

Cannibal. They take turns punching each other, each shot a

little harder than the last. It's like a violent game of

"slaps".

After a stretch of this, Hellbilly Cannibal reaches into his

sack and pulls out a can of BUG SPRAY. He SPRAYS it in

Randy's face. Randy falls off his chair. He staggers around

the ring clutching his face, howling in agony.

Hellbilly Cannibal smashes the blinded Randy over the head

with his chair. Randy falls to his knees. Hellbilly Cannibal

reaches into his sack and pulls out a FLUORESCENT LIGHT TUBE.

Wielding it like a bat, he SMACKS RANDY in the face. The tube

explodes with a pop.

Grabbing a folding chair, Hellbilly Cannibal charges toward

Randy. He takes a flying leap, riding the chair like a boogie

board. Just as he's about to crash down on Randy, Randy ROLLS

OUT OF THE WAY. Hellbilly Cannibal's spine gets a violent

jolt as the chair hits the mat.

Randy reaches into his Dollar Tree bag and pulls out an

aluminum COOKIE TRAY. He smacks Hellbilly Cannibal in the

face with it. The tray makes an awesomely loud METALLIC

CLANG. Randy hits him a bunch more times.

Randy is starting to get winded. His heart beats faster.

He picks up Hellbilly Cannibal and flings him toward the

ropes. Hellbilly Cannibal, bouncing off, ducks Randy's

awaiting forearm. He bounces off the opposite ropes and

crashes into Randy knee-first.

Hellbilly Cannibal grabs Randy by the hair and smashes his

face into the corner post. He scoops him up and FLIPS HIM

OVER THE TOP ROPE, out of the ring. Randy LANDS HARD on the

concrete floor.

Hellbilly Cannibal hops out of the ring with the folding

chair. He WHALES RANDY IN THE FACE with it. Randy stumbles

backwards toward the metal barricade between the ring and the

fans. Hellbilly Cannibal kicks him in the chest. Randy flips

over the barricade, into the crowd. Fans scatter in an

exhilarated panic.

Hellbilly Cannibal throws Randy into a row of empty chairs.

Randy goes sprawling. Chairs fly everywhere.

Randy gets up. His heart is beating LOUD. FAST.

Randy, dazed, heads toward the SNACK-BAR AREA. Hellbilly

Cannibal follows after him. Randy grabs a metal GARBAGE CAN

and WHIPS AROUND WITH IT, smacking Hellbilly Cannibal square

in the face. Hellbilly Cannibal goes down.

Randy shakes out the can's contents over Hellbilly Cannibal,

showering him in trash. He shoves Hellbilly Cannibal's head

into the can and falls on it, ass-first.

Randy grabs the ladder resting along the base of the ring. He

POUNDS THE GARBAGE CAN with it, making an UNHOLY RACKET.

With the can still over his head, Hellbilly Cannibal rises to

his feet. He HEADBUTTS RANDY with the can. Randy, stumbling

around, gets headbutted again. Hellbilly Cannibal throws off

the can and drags Randy back to the ring by his hair,

carrying the ladder in his other hand.

Plopping Randy down on the mat, Hellbilly Cannibal sets up

the ladder in the middle of the ring. He heads back out and

grabs the folding table, setting it up by the ladder. He

reaches into Randy's Dollar Tree bag and pulls out a BOX OF

THUMBTACKS. He scatters the tacks all over the table.

Hellbilly Cannibal grabs Randy and pulls him up the ladder

with him. They stand at the top, perched high above the

table. Just as Hellbilly Cannibal is about to push off, Randy

surprises him with a VICIOUS HEAD-BUTT. Hellbilly Cannibal is

caught totally off guard. Randy headbutts him again. Randy

grabs Hellbilly Cannibal and PUSHES OFF.

In mid-air, Randy does a 180 twist, causing Hellbilly

Cannibal to CRASH THROUGH THE TABLE with Randy on top of him.

Hellbilly Cannibal rolls around the mat in a daze, his back

bloodied and covered with tacks. He staggers to his feet.

Randy hits him with a dropkick.

Randy's heartbeat is DEAFENING. All other sounds drop out.

Randy pulls Hellbilly Cannibal off the mat. As he gears up

for another dropkick, his KNEES BUCKLE. A look comes over his

face. He DROPS TO HIS KNEES, one hand on the mat.

Randy grabs his arm. He massages it. He FLOPS OVER, clutching

his chest. He lies on his back gasping for breath, sucking at

the air.

RANDY'S POV: The fans are unaware anything is wrong. They

assume it's part of the act.

Hellbilly Cannibal sees a look of FEAR in Randy's eyes. He

knows this is real. He looks out at the crowd.

Few fans look around. Most of them still think this is a gag.

Among those who sense it's real is JERRY DIFUSCO, the event's

promoter. He climbs into the ring. Kneels over Randy.

Randy is gasping. DiFusco turns to Hellbilly Cannibal.

Lex Lethal and some of the other wrestlers climb into the

ring. They huddle around Randy.

With no small effort, they lift Randy. They carry him to the

ropes. They slow, unsure how best to get him through.

They lower him to the mat. Lex hops out of the ring and grabs

Randy's ankles.

Several of the other guys hop out of the ring, supporting

Randy's underside as they carefully, awkwardly pull him out.

By now, the crowd realizes this is real. They surge forward

as DiFusco and the wrestlers carry Randy toward the exit.

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Randy is carried down a LONG HALLWAY, trailed by curious and

concerned fans. Lex is closest to Randy's head.

They reach a door and enter. The wrestler holding Randy's

feet shuts it behind them.

INT. LOCKER ROOM/STAGING AREA - SHORT TIME LATER

Randy lies on a table, his eyes rolling back in his head. Lex

squeezes his hand, trying to keep him conscious.

EMS WORKERS come rushing in.

INT. SUFFOLK COUNTY HOSPITAL - POST-OP RECOVERY ROOM - NIGHT

Randy lies unconscious. There's a BREATHING TUBE in his mouth

and ANOTHER TUBE going through his CHEST WALL. He's hooked up

to a MECHANICAL VENTILATOR.

INT. POST-OP RECOVERY ROOM - NEXT DAY

Randy lies asleep. The breathing tube is out. The chest tube

is still in.

His eyes slowly open. He looks around, disoriented. Woozy.

Confused by all the wires on him, he starts PULLING THINGS

OFF. Monitors BEEP. Nurses rush into the room, calming him

down as they try to reattach the wires.

He faints.

INT. RANDY'S ROOM - NEXT DAY

Randy, transferred to a regular hospital room, is watching

"All My Children" on the wall-mounted TV. The chest tube is

out, in its place a large bandage.

Randy looks up. DR. TARACHANDANI (40) enters the room.

The doctor, nodding, looks down Randy's folder.

From the doctor's face, it's not quite that simple.

Randy gives him a reluctant nod.

Randy's nostrils flare.

Randy lets out a skeptical, sarcastic snort.

INT. SUFFOLK COUNTY HOSPITAL - ADMISSIONS DESK - MORNING

Randy is checking out of the hospital.

The ADMISSIONS-DESK WOMAN hands him some paperwork. He folds

it up and stuffs it in a pocket.

She hands him a plain white ENVELOPE. Randy opens it. Inside

is a NOTE:

YOU EARNED IT DUDE... YOUR A WARRIOR!

REST UP, FEEL BETTER.

----JERRY DIFUSCO

PS... IF YOUR UP BY THE 23RD, I GOT SOMETHING IN YONKERS

Randy looks into the envelope again and pulls out $300.

He looks at the money, chuckling ironically. It's his biggest

payday in years. He tucks it in a pocket.

EXT. SUFFOLK COUNTY HOSPITAL - SHORT TIME LATER

Randy steps out of the hospital into the bright light of day.

He squints, his eyes adjusting. He stands there looking

around, a lost animal.

EXT. NORTH BABYLON COMMUNITY CENTER - PARKING LOT - SHORT

TIME LATER

A CAB pulls up to Randy's van, still parked in the community

center's lot. Randy steps out of the cab and limps to the

van. He gets in.

INT. VAN - SHORT TIME LATER

Randy sits in the van in the otherwise empty lot, pondering

his next move.

INT. CVS PHARMACY - SHORT TIME LATER

Randy roams an aisle, killing time, idly browsing the

selection of deodorants.

Randy looks up. He heads down the aisle, toward the voice. He

comes to the...

PHARMACY COUNTER:

A female PHARMACIST stands holding a small pharmacy bag.

Randy heads toward her.

He gives her a small, embarrassed nod, taking the bag.

INT. PARADISE OAKS - MANAGER'S OFFICE - LATER

Randy hands Len the manager a bunch of cash. Len notices he

seems a little off.

EXT. RANDY'S TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER

Len removes the padlock from Randy's trailer door.

INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - KITCHENETTE - SHORT TIME LATER

A messy, junk-filled trailer. Randy stands at the kitchen

counter with the CVS bag.

He opens the bag and takes out FOUR PRESCRIPTION PILL

BOTTLES. We catch a glimpse of the drug names on them:

PLAVIX. COREG. LIPITOR, LISINOPRIL.

He gazes at the patient name on all of them...

RAMOVIC, ROBIN

INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - BATHROOM - LATER

Randy is taking a shower. On his chest is a SURGERY BANDAGE.

He soaps up, careful not to get the bandage wet.

INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - LATER

Randy collapses on the bed, exhausted.

INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - DAY

Randy lies on the bed, gazing off. Restless. Bored. Something

catches his eye.

RANDY'S POV: On the floor, in front of the TV, is an old

NINTENDO VIDEOGAME SYSTEM. The game cartridge in the console

is WRESTLEJAM `88.

EXT. RANDY'S TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER

Randy sticks his head out of his trailer.

RANDY'S POV: In front of the opposite trailer, ADAM (8), one

of the kids he was play-wrestling with, is idly throwing a

tennis ball against a car.

Adam turns and looks toward Randy.

INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER

Randy and Adam sit on the floor playing WrestleJam `88.

ON TV:

Cyber-Randy is wrestling The Ayatollah at a packed Madison

Square Garden. The graphics are late-'80s crude.

Randy flies all over the ring, devastating his foe with a

series of acrobatic leaps and kicks and flips.

RANDY AND ADAM:

Randy wears a look of intense concentration. Adam makes a

scrunched-up face at the screen.

Randy grunts, annoyed. They play for a stretch in silence.

Adam looks toward the window. Randy hits PAUSE.

Adam turns back to the TV.

Adam nods yeah. Randy un-pauses. Play resumes.

ON TV:

Cyber-Randy drops The Ayatollah with a knee to the chest. And

another. The Ayatollah GOES DOWN. Randy heads to a corner and

CLIMBS TO THE TOP ROPE.

He raises his arms, sticking his elbows out, pressing his

fists to the sides of his head to form a SET OF RAM'S HORNS.

Randy JUMPS. He flies high in the air, soaring over the mat

and crashing down on The Ayatollah horns-first. He pins The

Ayatollah as the ref counts to three for the victory. The

crowd goes wild.

RANDY AND ADAM:

Randy does a little celebratory fist pump. He hits RESET.

Adam gets up and scampers out of the trailer.

Randy, suddenly alone, looks at the TV. He gazes at the words

on the screen:

He selects 1 PLAYER.

A new match begins. Randy plays without much enthusiasm.

After a few halfhearted kicks and punches, he TOSSES THE

CONTROLLER ASIDE.

INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER

Randy, standing in the middle of the trailer, does a JUMPING

JACK. He does another. A few more.

He feels himself getting winded. A little woozy. He sits

down. He sits still, trying to slow his heart.

He starts to CRY.

Angry, bitter, frightened tears roll down his cheeks.

INT. CHEETAH'S - NIGHT

Randy enters the club. It's crowded tonight. He looks around

for Cassidy. He spots her in a corner offering a CUSTOMER a

lapdance. The customer passes. She moves on.

Randy heads over. She gives him a friendly little cheek peck.

Cassidy nods oh.

Cassidy finds the offer a little odd. This isn't how they

operate.

She looks at him, puzzled. He seems off.

Randy glances toward the door. Cassidy, catching his drift,

looks at him, a little gravely.

Pause.

Cassidy looks at him, torn. She sees the need, the fear in

his eyes.

Another pause of hesitation from Cassidy. This is big.

EXT. CHEETAH'S - REAR PARKING LOT - 15 MINUTES LATER

Randy sits in the van, staring at the club's rear EMERGENCY

EXIT. Cassidy emerges, a jacket covering her dress. Randy

waves. Spotting him, she comes over, climbing in the

passenger side.

She looks at his vulnerable expression.

Randy nods.

He chuckles, a little perversely.

Randy's grin fades. His expression turns melancholy, fearful.

He loses himself in some bleak thought.

He stares off bleakly again.

He turns to her, looking her in the eye.

She looks at him with sympathy.

Randy gives her a sour, disappointed look.

Randy shrugs, not so sure. Cassidy glances at the dashboard

clock.

She puts a sympathetic hand on his knee.

She gives him a peck on the cheek. He lingers there for a

second. A weird, tentative moment.

He nods, putting his brave face back on.

Cassidy laughs. She gives him a friendly pat on the shoulder.

Cassidy climbs out of the van. Randy watches as she heads

back into the club.

His cheery expression fades. He is alone again.

INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - DAY

Randy sits on his bed, sifting through a messy, junk-filled

shoebox. He pulls out an OLD PHOTO.

RANDY'S POV: It's a mid-'80s photo of Randy and his infant

daughter Stephanie in front of the family Christmas tree.

Randy, wearing a Santa cap, is smiling and laughing,

Stephanie perched on his huge, steroid-pumped bicep.

He flips the photo over. On the back are a bunch of scribbled

PHONE NUMBERS. They're all crossed-out except the last one.

The numbers get progressively more faded from bottom to top,

as if they've been written down over the course of years.

EXT. PARADISE OAKS - PAY PHONE - SHORT TIME LATER

Randy stands at a PAY PHONE with the photo, ringing phone

cradled to his ear.

Randy listens to the silence. He hangs up.

INT. VAN - LATER

Randy sits in his van by the curb of a modest, lower-middle-

class house. He looks at the house, working up the nerve to

approach.

EXT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - LATER

Randy stands at the doorstep of the house. Steeling himself,

he rings the bell. A WOMAN (22) appears at the door in a T-

SHIRT and PANTIES.

The woman looks at Randy a little coldly, sensing who he is.

She disappears into the house.

A few moments later, Stephanie emerges with a BACKPACK slung

over her shoulder. In her hands is a TEXTBOOK. She heads

straight down the driveway, blowing past Randy.

He goes after her.

He catches up. She stops.

She resumes walking, briskly.

He looks at the textbook in her hands: PRINCIPLES OF CHILD

DEVELOPMENT.

She turns DOWN THE SIDEWALK. He continues following.

No answer.

Stephanie picks up the pace, trying to lose him.

She keeps right on walking.

And walking.

She fights off an amused smile. She slows a tiny bit.

INT. VAN - SHORT TIME LATER

Randy is driving Stephanie.

Randy drives. He slows at the second stop sign, which is at a

bigger, FOUR-LANE STREET. He makes the left. They drive for a

stretch in awkward silence. Randy seems a little nervous.

A pause as Randy gathers his words.

He looks at her earnestly.

Stephanie sits there in calm silence, processing all of this.

She suddenly OPENS HER DOOR as the van is moving. She HOPS

OUT. Randy hits the brakes, alarmed.

Stephanie stumbles and falls. She gets up. Walks off in the

direction they came from.

She's gone. He angrily punches the steering wheel.

INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - NIGHT

Randy lies on his bed, gazing off depressedly. On his chest

is a well-worn DAY PLANNER, open to a marked-up page.

ANGLE ON page. Scribbled in marker in one of the boxes is

RAHWAY AUTOGRAF SHOW.

INT. RAHWAY RECREATION CENTER - GYMNASIUM - MORNING

Randy, standing at a folding table in a gym, unzips a duffel

bag. He pulls out a stack of 8x10 GLOSSIES of himself. It's a

high-flying, mid-air Ram Jam photo from the height of his

'80s glory.

He puts them on the table. Looks around the gym.

RANDY'S POV: He's at an AUTOGRAPH SHOW that hasn't started

yet. Around the perimeter of the gym, TEN FOLDING TABLES are

set up. At each one, a BEAT-UP, WORN-OUT OLD WRESTLER is

laying out his wares----8x10s, old match tapes, etc.

Randy looks up and sees Scott Brumberg, the promoter from the

beginning. He's wearing the same "BRUMBERG - 44" Mets jersey.

Randy smiles coyly.

Randy gives a proud "Hey, what can I say?" shrug.

Randy looks at him, surprised.

Randy looks at him blankly. Brumberg walks over to a nearby

table, where there's a stack of BRIGHT-ORANGE FLYERS. (The

same flyer can be seen scattered around the room on chairs,

the floor, etc.) He grabs one and brings it back over.

He hands it to Brumberg.

RANDY'S POV: The flyer.

RANDY:

Randy nods vaguely at the flyer, his feelings hard to read.

Brumberg looks around the room as the wrestlers set up shop.

Randy holds up his hand, wiggling his fingers for Brumberg.

Brumberg walks off. Randy looks at the flyer again. A sour

expression comes over his face.

INT. GYMNASIUM - SHORT TIME LATER

The signing is underway. FIVE OR SO FANS mill about the room,

drifting from table to table getting autographs and taking

photos with the motley assortment of washed-up aging

wrestlers.

ON RANDY:

Randy is sitting behind his table, signing one of his 8x10s

for a FAN. He hands it to the guy, who hands Randy a $5 bill.

The fan walks off. Randy tucks the fiver into the FANNY PACK

he's wearing. There's not much in there, just a meager few

ones and fives.

Randy zips up the fanny pack. He looks up, ready to sign more

autographs----just as soon as somebody comes over.

INT. GYMNASIUM - SHORT TIME LATER

Randy sits at his table, bored. There are NO TAKERS. He looks

around the room at the other wrestlers.

RANDY'S POV: One is asleep. Another looks borderline

homeless. Across from him is a 40-SOMETHING WRESTLER in a

WHEELCHAIR. Attached to his calf is a URINE BAG. A feeble

stream of urine trickles into the bag.

Randy looks down at the stack of Randy The Ram 8x10s on the

table. He gazes numbly at the high-flying image of himself

from 20 years earlier.

Randy looks up and sees Brumberg.

Randy shrugs resignedly.

INT. VAN - LATER

Randy pulls up to his trailer. He sits there with the engine

idling, staring at his trailer, scared to go in alone. He

pulls back out again.

INT. CHEETAH'S - SHORT TIME LATER

MUSIC - LIL' KIM - "HOW MANY LICKS?"

Cassidy, roaming the room, approaches a CUSTOMER sitting near

the stafe. She leans in to his ear, her hand on his arm.

Cassidy moves along. She approaches a PAIR OF GUYS. She leans

in to one of them.

She looks toward the other guy. Before she can even ask:

Cassidy heads off, rejected.

She turns and sees Randy. She's happy to see him after the

string of no's.

She leads him over to a table. They sit.

Randy dodges her eye contact.

Pause.

He nods dispiritedly.

Another half-hearted nod. A brief conversational lull.

Randy just looks at her blankly.

Cassidy, feeling bad, is hit with an urge to help.

Cassidy grabs a pen and a cocktail napkin off the bar.

She scribbles down YESTERDAZE - WESTFIELD. Hands it to him.

Cassidy starts dancing for him, as is their routine. Randy

doesn't seem into it.

Randy gets up and heads off toward the bar. She watches him

go, feeling rejected.

Cassidy gets up. CAMERA stays on her face as she does a lap

around the club. She glances back toward the bar.

CASSIDY'S POV: Randy is sitting at bar.

She scans the room. A CUSTOMER is looking her way. She starts

to approach. Then, she STOPS. She looks back toward Randy

again. He's sitting at the bar alone. She heads over to him.

He looks up from his drink.

Cassidy pauses, hesitant. She takes the plunge:

She gives him a chummy arm tap and walks off.

INT. SHOP-RITE - MORNING

Randy knocks on Wayne's door.

INT. WAYNE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Wayne looks up at Randy, mildly annoyed by the disruption. On

his computer screen is an ONLINE POKER game.

Randy seems a little hesitant.

Randy thinks it over.

EXT. SUNRISE SHOPPING PLAZA - PARKING LOT - DAY

Randy stands alone in front of YESTERDAZE, a strip-mall

vintage clothing store. He looks at his watch, almost

thinking of leaving.

Randy looks up. He seems slightly thrown by what he sees.

RANDY'S POV: It's his first time seeing Cassidy in street

clothes and in daylight. She's not wearing makeup, and her

hair is pulled back in a ponytail. She's also a good three

inches shorter out of her stripper heels.

They shake hands, a bit awkwardly.

Randy looks at her sneakers, a far cry from the clear heels

he's used to.

She gives the question genuine thought.

INT. YESTERDAZE - SHORT TIME LATER

Randy follows Cassidy toward the back of the store. He looks

around, taking in the array of funky `50s/'60s/'70s clothes.

Cassidy is less loose and playful than Randy, much more in

business mode. They come to the back where, against the wall,

she finds what she's looking for: a bunch of CARDBOARD BOXES

bursting with a wildly eclectic assortment of tops, skirts,

pants, etc. She starts sifting through.

Cassidy spots a fun, multi-color MINI-SKIRT. She pulls it

out.

Cassidy tosses it back in. She unearths a Flashdance-style

SWEATSHIRT.

Randy makes a sour face. She tosses it back.

Randy ponders the choices.

Cassidy lets out a good-natured groan of frustration. Randy

watches as she continues searching.

Cassidy looks at him. She can feel his sincere appreciation.

She returns to searching. Sift, sift, sift, sift...

Cassidy stops sifting. She looks up at him.

Cassidy leads Randy by the arm over to the...

MEN'S AREA:

Cassidy heads to a RACK OF CLOTHES. She quickly zeroes in on

a RETRO BOWLING SHIRT. She holds it up to Randy, who makes a

scrunched-up face.

Cassidy puts the bowling shirt back. As she does, something

catches Randy's eye.

Cassidy holds up the item for Randy.

An excited look comes over Randy's face.

RANDY'S POV: A satin-green ROLLER-DISCO JACKET. Embroidered

on the left breast is a big "S" in purple script. It's UGLY.

Cassidy looks at the jacket. She clearly finds it awful.

She looks at Randy, who's beaming with excitement and pride.

She finds it very endearing.

EXT. SUNRISE SHOPPING PLAZA - PARKING LOT - SHORT TIME LATER

Yesterdaze bag in hand, Randy opens the door to his van. He

and tosses the bag inside. He's on a post-shop high, mission

accomplished.

A tentative pause. Cassidy looks at him, ready to part ways.

Cassidy seems torn.

Cassidy nods. Yup.

Cassidy shrugs casually.

Randy looks off at something by his van. An idea hits him.

He unlocks the door. Leaning into the van, he TEARS THE RANDY

THE RAM ACTION FIGURE OFF THE DASHBOARD. He proudly,

excitedly holds it out to Cassidy.

She looks at the action figure, reluctant to take it.

Cassidy chuckles a little. She takes it.

Cassidy laughs a little. She can't help but be charmed by his

sweetness and earnestness. After a pause...

INT. LOCAL BAR - SHORT TIME LATER

Randy and Cassidy are having beers at the bar. He's holding

her CELLPHONE, looking at PICTURES of her son. He moves on to

the next one.

Cassidy smiles, flattered.

Randy skips to the next pic. It's a shot of an UNDER-

CONSTRUCTION CONDO BUILDING.

MUSIC: DEF LEPPARD - "POUR SOME SUGAR ON ME"

Randy's ears perk up at the song on the jukebox.

He stands up, reaching out for Cassidy's hand. She doesn't

give it.

Randy starts DANCING in front of Cassidy, who's sitting on a

barstool. She smiles.

Randy goes into lapdance mode, "seductively" writhing for

her, silly and self-aware.

He turns around, wiggling his ass a little for her. He runs

his hands up and down her sides. He drapes his long blond

mane over her shoulders, running it over her face. She

laughs, charmed and amused.

He gazes into her eyes intensely.

Cassidy laughs. He continues dancing, totally unembarrassed.

Randy bobs his head along to the kick-ass Def Leppard tune,

really loving it.

The song builds to its chorus. Randy SINGS ALONG.

Cassidy, unable to resist the call of the Lep, joins in.

From here, the song veers off into a GUITAR PART. Randy nods

along, savoring the awesome hair-metal riffing.

Randy shakes his head sourly.

Their EYES MEET. A moment of CHEMISTRY. Mutual attraction.

Randy moves closer, his eyes locked on hers. He leans in

for... a KISS.

They MAKE OUT for a few seconds. Cassidy PULLS BACK.

She gives Randy a playfully scolding FINGER WAG, masking her

fear and discomfort with what just happened.

He keeps right on dancing, totally unaware of the shift that

just occurred in her.

She stands up. Randy is very disappointed.

Randy points toward her ALMOST-FULL BEER on the bar. She

picks it up and CHUGS the whole thing. She slaps the empty

bottle on the bar.

She gives him an arm pat and walks out of the bar. Randy is

impressed.

INT. SHOP-RITE - EMPLOYEE ROOM - MORNING

It's Randy's first day of work. He slips into a DELI COAT.

Tucks his hair into a hairnet. Pulls a Shop-Rite baseball cap

over the hairnet.

He walks over to a mirror to see how he looks in his new

uniform. He feels a little silly.

He turns and sees Wayne, who hands him something. Randy looks

at the item in his hand, vaguely bothered.

ANGLE ON item, a Shop-Rite NAME TAG. The name on it is ROBIN.

Wayne walks off. Randy pins the name tag to his apron. He

takes another look in the mirror, sighing unhappily.

Randy looks up at the employee-room clock. It's 8:59 AM.

He heads toward a RUBBER-STRIP CURTAIN leading to the deli

counter. Standing before the curtain, he pauses a moment,

gathering himself like before a wrestling match.

He steps through. Showtime.

INT. DELI COUNTER - DAY

About 10 CUSTOMERS hover in front of the deli counter with

Take-A-Number tickets.

Randy, manning the counter, hands an OLD GUY in a WWII

VETERAN baseball cap a packet of roast beef. The guy shuffles

off. Randy looks up at the Take-A-Number sign.

A WOMAN (60s) steps forward holding a 17 and a SHOP-RITE

CIRCULAR. She carefully surveys the TURKEY-BREAST SELECTION

in the case.

Randy looks clueless.

She hands the circular to Randy to take a look.

RANDY'S POV: It says HUDSON ACRES TURKEY BREAST - $5.99/LB.

He still has no idea.

Randy briefly catches eyes with another customer, a BIG-

HAIRED, SEMI-HOT PARTY CHICK in her forties. The kind of

woman Randy would hit on in a bar. He dodges her eye contact,

embarrassed by the context.

Randy picks up a phone behind the counter.

He cringes a bit as his voice booms over the store speakers.

He hangs up and returns to the customer.

The woman, nodding, looks into the deli case again.

Randy steals a self-conscious glance at the party chick.

INT. DELI COUNTER - LATER

ANGLE ON Take-A-Number sign. It says NOW SERVING: 46.

A WOMAN (35) in workout clothes steps forward with a 46.

Randy grabs a plastic container.

The woman smiles at Randy's little offhand pasta pun. This

pleases him.

Randy scoops pesto pasta salad into the container. He puts

the container onto the scale. It reads .51 LB.

This gets Randy a small chuckle from the woman. Randy slaps a

price tag on the container.

He hands her the container.

The woman heads off. Randy's spirits are lifted by the

exchange.

INT. DELI COUNTER - LATER

Randy looks up at the Take-A-Number sign: NOW SERVING: 57.

A HOUSEWIFE-TYPE steps forward with the number.

The housewife smiles.

He grabs a plastic container and throws it in the air,

catching it behind his back.

EXT. MIDDLESEX COUNTY COMMUNITY COLLEGE - DAY

Stephanie emerges from the Middlesex County Community College

building. A look of surprise comes over her face.

STEPHANIE'S POV: Randy is standing there waiting for her by

his van. Under his arm is a LUMPILY WRAPPED PRESENT, no box.

He excitedly hands her the present. She looks at it warily.

She opens it. Inside is the green satin jacket. She holds it

up, trying to process.

She looks at the jacket. It's nothing she would ever wear.

She looks at Randy. He is excited and proud.

Stephanie nods, smiling politely.

He giver her his biggest, most charming puppy-dog smile.

EXT. POINT PLEASANT BOARDWALK - LATER

Randy and Stephanie walk along the boardwalk. It's a charming

little Jersey-shore boardwalk/beach lined with Skee-Ball

games, ice-cream parlors, T-shirt shops etc. It's a bit cold

and not very crowded, still out of season.

They walk for a stretch in silence. He points to a spot.

Randy chuckles at the memory.

EXT. BOARDWALK - SHORT TIME LATER

Randy and Stephanie sit on a bench facing the ocean eating

mint-chocolate chip ice-cream cones. Randy is quiet and

contemplative, not in his usual "on" mode. He takes a deep

breath.

She shoots him an irked look.

Her expression softens.

Stephanie is surprised by his emotion and sincerity.

Stephanie nods.

Randy gazes off at the ocean, filled with fear and love and

regret. A tear starts to gather in his eye. He wipes it away

before it has a chance to form.

Stephanie looks at him, moved.

INT. BOARDWALK ARCADE - SHORT TIME LATER

Randy and Stephanie play Skee-Ball side-by-side, father and

daughter.

EXT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - SHORT TIME LATER

Randy stands with Stephanie in front of her house, dropping

her off.

Randy, unsure what to do, extends his hand.

They shake. He pulls her in for a brief, mechanical hug.

Another pause.

Stephanie thinks it over.

Randy is surprised and happy.

INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - LATER

Randy sticks the old Christmas photo of Stephanie and himself

on the fridge.

EXT. PARADISE OAKS - PAY PHONE - DAY

Randy stands at the pay phone, ringing phone to his ear. In

his hands is his day planner, open to a page marked up with

upcoming gigs.

EXT. PAY PHONE - MOMENTS LATER

Another call.

EXT. PAY PHONE - MOMENTS LATER

Another call. Randy is holding the Fanfest flyer.

INT. CHEETAH'S - NIGHT

MUSIC: WARRANT - "CHERRY PIE"

Cassidy is up on stage, doing her thing for a sizable crowd.

She slinks up to a customer who's holding out a dollar bill

for her. She pulls on her G-string band, snapping it shut on

the bill.

She moves over to another customer holding out a dollar and

does the same.

She looks toward the voice, coming from another side of the

stage.

CASSIDY'S POV: Standing there is Randy, holding out a PURPLE

ENVELOPE. He looks toward her G-string, like he wants to put

it in like a dollar bill.

She takes it with her hand instead.

INT. CHEETAH'S - SHORT TIME LATER

Randy and Cassidy sit together at a table. Cassidy is holding

the purple envelope, looking a little uncomfortable.

Reluctantly, Cassidy opens it. Inside is a GREETING CARD.

CASSIDY'S POV: On the card's front, a cartoon monkey is

holding a big bunch of bananas. Across the top, it says

THANKS A BUNCH!

Randy watches excitedly as she reads the inside. She puts the

it down after reading it.

She nods politely, reservedly, clearly trying to pull back.

Another guarded nod.

Randy is confused and disappointed.

A long, wounded pause from Randy.

He takes a $20 out of his pocket, holding it out to her.

He slides it across the bar to her. She slides it back.

He slides the $20 back to her.

She slides it back again.

He waves the $20 tauntingly in her face. She pushes it away.

He tauntingly dangles the $20 in front of her again.

She looks away, trying to ignore him.

She SWATS HIS HAND. The $20 falls to the floor. He picks it

up and SLAMS IT on the bar.

People turn and stare. Randy storms out of the club,

humiliated.

INT. SHOP-RITE - DELI COUNTER - DAY

About 10 CUSTOMERS hover in front of the DELI COUNTER

clutching Take-A-Number tickets. Randy, manning the counter

with a COWORKER, hands a WOMAN a packet of roast beef.

An OLD LADY steps forward.

Randy grabs a container and starts scooping potato salad. He

puts the container on the scale. It reads 1.06 LB.

Randy scoops out a little and weighs it again. The scale

reads .96 LB.

Randy puts a little more in. The scale reads 1.03.

Randy, trying to contain his aggravation, takes a tiny bit

out. The scale reads 1.00. The lady nods in approval.

Randy slaps a price sticker on the container and hands it

across the counter.

She shuffles off with her potato salad.

A BLUE-COLLAR GUY (40s) steps forward.

The guy does a DOUBLE-TAKE, noticing Randy's face.

The guy studies Randy's face, trying hard to place it.

Randy reaches into the case and pulls out a ham. He brings it

over to the slicer, his back turned away from the guy.

Slice, slice, slice, slice...

Slice, slice, slice, slice...

Randy, shaking his head no, brings the sliced ham over to the

weigh scale. The guy SNAPS HIS FINGERS.

He looks at Randy, surprised and amazed.

Randy stands there frozen.

Randy, shrugging blankly, wraps up the ham and slaps a price

sticker on.

Randy grabs the Jarlsberg from the case and brings it over to

the slicer. He starts slicing.

ANGLE ON the block of cheese as Randy slices. There's only a

SMALL CHUNK left. The chunk dwindles, getting smaller and

smaller. The cheese separating Randy's fingers from the blade

grows thin.

He almost seems tempted.

INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - LATE NIGHT

Randy, unable to sleep, sits shirtless on the couch, staring

blankly at the TV.

ON TV:

An NBA HIGHLIGHT CLIP of a FEROCIOUS DUNK. The crowd goes

wild. The player roars as he runs back up court, full of

macho swagger.

RANDY:

Randy's eyes drift downward toward his chest. He gazes at the

still-fresh scar. Touches it tenderly.

He takes a big swig of wine, polishing off a bottle. He pops

a cassette into the BOOMBOX on the floor. GUNS `N' ROSES -

USE YOUR ILLUSION II.

Randy cranks up the volume and hits PLAY...

MUSIC: GUNS `N' ROSES - "GET IN THE RING"

The song begins with the sound of a ROARING STADIUM CROWD. A

chant begins:

Randy starts to prowl the floor like it's a wrestling ring

before a match. He waves his arms, exhorting the crowd on the

song as if their cheers are for him.

Randy works the crowd. He points at a fan in the back row.

Flexes theatrically. Bangs his head on pretend chairs.

Randy grabs the top rope and gives it a hard shake. Loosening

up with some neck rolls and trunk twists, he heads to the

center of the ring.

The song, which starts with a slow, bluesy guitar intro,

kicks in. FAST, RAGING HARD ROCK.

Randy stares down his invisible opponent. The opponent SUCKER

PUNCHES him. Randy drops to the ground.

Randy lies on the floor getting kicked and punched. He knocks

his opponent down with a LEG SWEEP and pops up.

Randy hits his opponent with a flurry of backhand chops.

Randy immobilizes his opponent in some sort of headlock.

Randy flips his opponent upside down, his head between his

knees. He drops him headfirst onto the bed/mat.

Randy scoops up his opponent again and SLAMS HIM TO THE MAT

with another fancy move.

The song reaches its frenzied, chant-like CHORUS:

Randy joins in, pumping his fist.

INT. NINTH INNING COLLECTIBLES - DAY

A strip-mall sports-card/comic-book shop. Tacked to the wall

by the entrance are FLYERS for various events----card shows,

autograph signings, etc.

Behind the counter is promoter Scott Brumberg, scarfing down

a sloppy Subway sub. The door opens. He looks up, smiling.

Randy heads over and gives him a warm hello handclasp.

Brumberg pulls him in for a hug.

Brumberg, nodding, reaches down and grabs out a beat-up

SPIRAL NOTEBOOK with old event flyers sticking out.

INT. BRIDGEPORT NORTH HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - LATER

A high-school cafeteria. Randy is slipping into a REFEREE

UNIFORM. Along the wall hangs a vinyl banner reading CAPW -

CONNECTICUT ALL-PRO WRESTLING.

Randy looks up and sees BOOKER D (30s), a big, black wrestler

in FULL PIMP REGALIA. Though not a pro like Randy, he's upper-

tier indie circuit. Randy gives him a grin and handshake.

Booker D looks at him, surprised and puzzled.

INT. BRIDGEPORT NORTH H.S. - GYMNASIUM - SHORT TIME LATER

Booker D lands on opponent SHAWN MCPRIDE with a BIG SUPLEX.

He falls on top of McPride for the pin. Randy The Ref smacks

the mat, counting.

McPride kicks out. Booker D lifts up McPride. He hits him

with a CHEST CHOP, sending him stumbling backwards into the

ropes. Booker D goes after him.

CAMERA STAYS ON RANDY'S FACE as he watches them wrestle off-

screen.

Randy's eyes are glued to the action... Punches. Kicks.

Suplexes. Bodyslams. The crowd is going crazy.

He is tempted. Salivating almost.

More punches. More cheers. Bodies crash loudly against the

mat. Randy's temptation grows with each shot. He can't resist

any longer. He...

JUMPS IN.

Randy pushes Booker D out of the way. He's SMASHED IN THE

FACE by a McPride-swung folding chair meant for Booker D.

Randy goes down. A TRACE OF A SMILE is visible on his face.

INT. BOYS' LOCKER ROOM - SHOWER AREA - POST-MATCH

Randy, Booker D, and McPride are SHOWERING in the open shower

area. They're on a post-match high.

McPride gives Randy a "We're not worthy" bow of respect.

Randy gives him a "Hey, what can I say?" shrug.

McPride and Booker D both look toward Randy. He's the one

they're interested in hanging with.

INT. HOLIDAY INN BRIDGEPORT - HOTEL BAR - LATER

A hotel bar, lively and hopping with a weekend crowd. Randy

sits at the bar, holding court with Booker D and McPride.

They're all well on their way to being drunk.

Booker D and McPride CRACK UP.

McPride looks at him blankly.

McPride and Booker D roar with delight.

Randy beams proudly.

Booker D spots something intriguing by the bar entrance.

Randy and McPride follow his gaze there.

RANDY'S POV: TWO WOMEN----late 30s, frosted hair, tight denim

miniskirts----just walked in the bar. He catches the twosome

stealing a glance in their direction.

Randy and McPride seem to agree with his assessment.

INT. HOTEL BAR - LATER

MUSIC: BLACK CROWES - "HARD TO HANDLE"

The wrestlers are dancing with the women, MELISSA and ALYSSA,

on the bar's dance floor. Melissa is sandwiched between

Booker D and McPride, shaking her ass for them like a 19-year-

old spring breaker.

Alyssa is paired off with Randy, grinding her ass against

him. She turns, facing him. Looks at him with a coy smile.

She slowly runs her hands up Randy's sides.

Randy smiles, pleased.

Alyssa notices something intriguing over Randy's shoulder.

Randy turns to see what she's looking at.

RANDY'S POV: Standing by the bar is a MAN.

He turns back to Alyssa.

Randy nods oh. A slightly weird moment between them.

They exchange a look.

INT. WOMEN'S BATHROOM - SHORT TIME LATER

A single-person bathroom. Randy and Alyssa are doing BUMPS OF

COKE.

INT. WOMEN'S BATHROOM - SHORT TIME LATER

Randy is FUCKING Alyssa from behind over the bathroom sink.

Alyssa MOANS LOUDLY.

There's a KNOCK at the door.

BLACK SCREEN.

RANDY'S POV:   His eyes slowly open. Staring down at him from a

white stucco   ceiling is a poster of a HUNKY, SHIRTLESS

FIREMAN with   a pair of suspenders stretched across his oiled-

up six pack.   Across the bottom it says FIVE-ALARM FIRE.

Randy looks around, disoriented. He is NAKED in a strange bed

in a strange bedroom. His clothes lie on the floor next to a

LARGE GLASS BONG.

INT. KITCHEN - SHORT TIME LATER

Randy, wearing only a pair of bikini briefs, staggers into

the KITCHEN. A ROOMMATE (23) in a Tweety Bird nightshirt is

pouring herself a bowl of Honey Nut Cheerios. She looks at

Randy with a casual "wassup" head-nod.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - SHORT TIME LATER

Randy emerges from Alyssa's building in the previous night's

clothes, squinting at the blinding sunlight.

INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER

Randy enters his trailer, chuckling amusedly. He tosses his

keys on the table.

He heads over to the fridge and grabs a beer. As he closes

the fridge, his expression changes. A look of DEEP DISMAY

comes over his face.

RANDY'S POV: The old photo of him and Stephanie on the fridge

door.

EXT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - SHORT TIME LATER

Randy rings the bell. Stephanie's "friend" answers the door.

She stares at him coldly and unnervingly.

She goes into the house, closing the door behind her. Randy

stands there awkwardly, unsure what that meant.

He thinks about knocking but doesn't. He carefully turns the

knob, leaning into the house. From somewhere inside, he hears

the MUFFLED SOUND of Stephanie and The Friend talking.

INT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Stephanie and The Friend are arguing in the living room.

THE FRIEND'S/STEPHANIE'S POV: Standing there is Randy, gazing

guiltily at Stephanie.

The Friend, disgusted, grabs her coat and STORMS OFF out the

front door.

Randy and Stephanie are alone. She glares at him for what

feels like a long time.

She grabs a SMALL POTTED PLANT off the table and THROWS IT AT

HIM. It NARROWLY MISSES HIS HEAD, exploding against the wall.

She grabs a CAN OF SODA off the same table and THROWS IT. It

NAILS HIM IN THE THIGH, exploding open on the floor. Soda

sprays everywhere.

She looks around, half-crazed, searching for something else

to throw. He rushes toward her, wrapping her up in his arms.

He SQUEEZES TIGHTER. She THRASHES AROUND, fighting it.

Suddenly, she STOPS RESISTING. A STRANGE AND UNEXPECTED CALM

washes over her.

She is silent and still.

She shakes her head, placidly gazing off.

She turns and looks him in the eye.

Randy doesn't.

She walks toward the front door. Opens it wide.

EXT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Randy steps out the front door. Stephanie's cellphone rings.

She looks at the caller ID and picks up.

She closes the door on him, disappearing inside the house.

Randy stands there alone on his daughter's front step. Unsure

what to do. He starts to CRY.

INT. SHOP-RITE - DELI COUNTER - DAY

ANGLE ON Take-A-Number sign. It reads NOW SERVING: 54

A crowd of AGGRAVATED CUSTOMERS stand waiting at the counter.

A FAT GUY in a motorized cart clutching a 71 throws a fellow

customer a "Do you believe these morons?" eye roll.

Behind the counter are Randy and a COWORKER. Randy is putting

a block of Havarti onto the slicer. He moves lackadaisically,

distractedly.

Wayne, noticing as he roams past, heads over.

Wayne gives him TWO QUICK CLAPS and walks off. Randy adjusts

the machine's setting and begins to slice. He isn't moving

much faster.

While we're young...             Any year now...

Randy keeps right on slicing at his unhurried pace. He gets

in a nice, meditative groove.

Slice, slice, slice, slice, slice...

He watches as his thumb inches closer to the spinning blade.

He stares at his thumb. At the blade. His thumb.

He JAMS HIS THUMB INTO THE BLADE.

Blood squirts everywhere. On his coat. On the deli meat.

Randy stares at the DEEP GASH, watching as blood pulses out

in crimson surges. He smiles strangely at it.

A customer GASPS. A commotion quickly spreads.

Randy turns and sees a shocked Wayne rushing toward him.

Wayne takes Randy's arm and tries to lead him into the back,

out of view.

Randy roughly SHOVES him away. Wayne stumbles backwards.

Randy, turning toward the onlookers, raises his thumb to his

face. He dramatically smears the BLOOD ACROSS HIS MOUTH.

Customers GASP. A woman SHRIEKS.

Randy drags the gash across his cheek. He SMEARS A LINE OF IT

under each eye like WARPAINT.

Randy ROARS at Wayne. Wayne JUMPS BACK, frightened. Randy

rumbles out of the deli area LAUGHING.

SUPERMARKET AISLE:

Randy dashes down an aisle. He dodges a WOMAN PUSHING A

SHOPPING CART, purposely "over-dodging" her so he CRASHES

INTO THE SHELVES and sends stuff flying. He dodges ANOTHER

SHOPPER, dramatically crashing into the shelves again.

FRONT REGISTER AREA:

Randy charges past the CASHIERS, out of the supermarket.

INT. VAN - SHORT TIME LATER

Randy sits in the van in the Shop-Rite parking lot. He gazes

at himself in the rear-view mirror, dried blood caked on his

face.

He likes it.

last wrestled.

INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - LATER

Randy stands in the middle of the trailer in just a pair of

bikini briefs. In his hands is a product called TAN IN A CAN.

He gives the can a good shake and starts spraying his body.

INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - SHORT TIME LATER

Randy puts a snacks-and-soda-filled plastic bag in the front

of the van. He is surprised to see Cassidy pull up in her

car. She gets out.

Randy nods oh.

Randy nods. He heads toward his trailer. Cassidy follows.

INT. RANDY'S TRAILER - CONTINUOUS

Randy enters the trailer, Cassidy close behind.

Randy heads to his wheelie bag, open on the bed.

He zips up his bag. Walks outside toward his van. She

follows.

EXT. RANDY'S TRAILER - CONTINUOUS

He gets in the van.

He grabs the Fanfest flyer off the passenger seat and hands

it to her.

He DRIVES OFF. She watches him go, the van kicking up dust in

its wake.

She looks at flier. A look of concern comes over her face.

INT. VAN - EVENING

MUSIC: SKID ROW - "I REMEMBER YOU"

Randy is driving south on the New Jersey Turnpike.

INT. CASSIDY'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Cassidy grabs her purse and car keys off the kitchen table.

The BABYSITTER (15) nods at the instructions. Cassidy heads

toward the...

LIVING ROOM:

She is struck by what she sees.

CASSIDY'S POV: DANIEL (9) is on the floor, playing with the

Randy The Ram doll.

She watches as he makes the Randy doll climb up the couch's

armrest. The doll takes a FLYING LEAP off the couch, onto a

STAR WARS FIGURE laid out on the floor below. Daniel makes an

EXPLOSION SOUND as Randy slams down on his foe.

Cassidy looks at the doll, worried.

INT. CHEETAH'S - LATER

MUSIC: WARRANT - "CHERRY PIE"

Cassidy is dancing onstage. She has a distracted, faraway

look in her eye.

She abruptly WALKS OFF mid-song.

She heads toward the dressing room, disappearing through the

curtain.

a duffel bag. She grabs the MASTER LOCK off the locker door

and throws it into the bag, too.

bag.

She cuts across the empty stage, toward the exit.

Randy enters the locker room with his wheelie bag.

Randy looks down a row of lockers.

RANDY'S POV: A huge, dark-skinned man in khakis and a BOB

ZAYID PONTIAC polo is talking to SOME OTHER WRESTLER. This is

THE AYATOLLAH (52).

The Ayatollah looks up and sees Randy looking at him.

Randy heads over.

The Ayatollah chortles.

The Ayatollah gives him a dismissive, cavalier wave.

The Ayatollah chuckles. Randy walks off, highly annoyed.

INT. GAS STATION - SHORT TIME LATER

Cassidy pulls into a gas station. She rolls down the window.

A GAS STATION ATTENDANT looks her way.

INT. GREENVILLE CIVIC AUDITORIUM - LOCKER ROOM - LATER

The card is underway. Through a wall, we hear the muffled

sounds of a MATCH IN PROGRESS: cheers, boos, crashes, etc.

Randy, sitting alone on a bench in just his jock strap, tapes

up his legs. His focus and intensity builds.

EXT. GREENVILLE CIVIC AUDITORIUM - PARKING LOT - SHORT TIME

LATER

Cassidy pulls into the lot. There's a lot more cars than when

Randy pulled in.

INT. GREENVILLE CIVIC AUDITORIUM - OUTER CONCOURSE - SHORT

TIME LATER

The building's outer concourse. A handful of fans mill about

at a CONCESSIONS STAND and a SOUVENIR TABLE.

Cassidy, handing a ticket to an USHER, enters the building.

She looks around the concourse, not quite sure where to go.

INT. LOCKER ROOM - LATER

Randy, suited up in his tights, paces the floor, gearing

himself up for the match. The only other wrestler in the

locker room at the moment is The Ayatollah, doing neck rolls

nearby. Randy catches his eyes.

Through the wall, ARABIC MUSIC starts to play.

The Ayatollah grabs a large IRANIAN FLAG leaning against the

lockers. He heads toward an ENTRANCE CURTAIN, Randy close

behind.

The Ayatollah steps through the curtain, Iranian flag raised

high. He is promptly greeted with LUSTY BOOS.

INT. OUTER CONCOURSE - CONTINUOUS

Cassidy is walking around the concourse with a mounting sense

urgency. She spots a SECURITY GUY in a yellow windbreaker

sitting by an UNMARKED DOOR. She heads toward him.

INT. LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Randy is peering through the narrow gap in the curtain,

watching The Ayatollah make his entrance.

Randy, turning, is surprised to see Cassidy standing there.

She looks tired and worried and scared.

Randy looks away, unable to hold her gaze. Through the

curtain, we hear the Arabic music DIE DOWN.

A new, familiar song rises on the auditorium speakers.

MUSIC: AC/DC - "IF YOU WANT BLOOD (YOU GOT IT)"

The crowd roars.

Randy looks at the curtain. He looks at Cassidy.

He pulls her off.

He turns away from her, toward the curtain.

He steps through.

INT. AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS

Randy bursts through the curtain to HUGE CHEERS. There's

probably 700 people there in the 2,200-seat facility.

INT. COMMENTATORS' TABLE - CONTINUOUS

Seated at a ringside table are the match's COMMENTATORS, a

pair of wannabe Marv Alberts in their 20s. A sign taped to

the table reads CAROLINA WRESTLING NETWORK. Next to the table

is a VIDEOCAMERA on a tripod.

Randy raises a set of ram's horns high in the air. Fans do

the same in tribute.

Randy takes a long lap around the ring, ramming chair after

chair. His head gets a little bloody. The fans eat it up.

Randy climbs into the ring, where The Ayatollah awaits.

The cheers continue. Loving, appreciative, sustained cheers.

Randy stands there soaking it in, basking in their love.

He grabs the microphone from the ring announcer. He looks

around. A hush comes over the crowd.

Randy looks toward Cassidy, standing over by the entrance

curtain. He looks out at the larger crowd.

LOUD CHEERS. Randy takes a contemplative pause.

Randy looks toward Cassidy, who's standing over by the

entrance curtain. Their eyes meet.

Randy lowers the mike, finished. The fans CHEER WILDLY, the

loudest cheers yet.

As Randy nods appreciatively at the crowd, The Ayatollah

SNEAKS UP BEHIND HIM with a folding chair.

Fans shout, trying to warn Randy about the sneak attack, but

he doesn't hear them.

The Ayatollah SMASHES HIM OVER THE HEAD. Randy goes down. The

match is on.

The Ayatollah picks up Randy and throws him into the ropes.

Randy bounces back toward The Ayatollah, who lazily puts up

an elbow for Randy to run into. Randy practically has to lead

his face to the elbow. Hitting the mat, Randy pops back up

and grabs The Ayatollah.

The Ayatollah, phoning it in, throws Randy into the ropes

again. This time, The Ayatollah has a raised knee waiting for

Randy. Randy runs into it, doing his best to sell the shot.

Randy gets up and grabs The Ayatollah's arms. With a nifty

move, he flips The Ayatollah over his shoulder, SLAMMING HIM

HARD into the mat. Randy falls on top of him, pressing The

Ayatollah's face into the canvas.

Randy flips The Ayatollah over onto his back, pinning his

shoulder blades. The REF swoops in.

The Ayatollah KICKS OUT. They both get up. The Ayatollah jogs

toward the ropes. He bounces off. Randy braces for something

good, but all he gets is a feeble CHEST SLAP. Randy grabs The

Ayatollah and puts him in a headlock.

Randy scoops up The Ayatollah and drops him over his knee

with a BACKBREAKER. The Ayatollah grimaces in pain as he hits

the mat. Before he has a chance to get up, Randy hits him

with a FLYING ELBOW DROP.

The Ayatollah gets up, pissed at the rough treatment.

Randy goes for a dropkick, but The Ayatollah catches his

ankles in midair. He JERKS UPWARD on Randy's legs, sending

Randy CRASHING TO THE MAT on the back of his head. The

Ayatollah falls on Randy's throat with his knee. He grinds

Randy's face into the canvas as Randy did to him.

ENTRANCE CURTAIN:

Cassidy is cringing. It's hard for her to watch this.

THE RING:

The Ayatollah picks up Randy and throws him into the ropes.

Randy bounces back, flinging himself sideways at The

Ayatollah. The Ayatollah catches him in mid-air, cradling him

in his arms. The Ayatollah drops Randy onto his bent knee.

Randy falls to the canvas, clutching his side. The Ayatollah

falls on top of him.

The ref swoops in.

Randy KICKS OUT. As Randy "recovers", The Ayatollah jumps out

of the ring and grabs a folding chair.

The Ayatollah, climbing back in, props up the chair in a

corner. He picks Randy off the mat and flings him at the

chair. Randy VAULTS OVER IT, sailing through the ropes and

OUT OF THE RING. He hits the concrete floor, CRASHING against

the metal barricade.

ENTRANCE CURTAIN:

Cassidy winces. She starts to tear up a little.

THE RING:

The Ayatollah hops out of the ring. He stands over Randy,

kicking him repeatedly. He grabs his Iranian flag, waving it

tauntingly at the crowd.

Camelfucker!                       Fat piece of shit!

The Ayatollah looks down at Randy.

THE CROWD:

Boos rain down on The Ayatollah.

JUST OUTSIDE RING:

The Ayatollah takes the butt end of his flag pole and JABS IT

into Randy's side. Randy grimaces in pain.

The Ayatollah unties the flag from its pole and WRAPS IT

around Randy's neck. He JERKS UPWARD on the flag, lifting

Randy off the mat by his neck. Randy THRASHES AROUND,

fighting for breath.

The Ayatollah releases Randy from the choke. Randy crumples

to the ground, gasping for air. The Ayatollah picks up Randy

by his hair and flings him back in the ring.

THE RING:

The Ayatollah grabs the folding chair from the corner. He

SMASHES RANDY OVER THE HEAD with it. Randy's forehead is

BLEEDING. The Ayatollah hits him again, taking dead aim at

the forehead cut. MORE BLOOD. Randy crumples to the mat.

ENTRANCE CURTAIN:

Cassidy, alarmed, instinctively goes halfway toward the ring.

THE RING:

The Ayatollah scoops up Randy and BODYSLAMS him. He falls on

Randy knee-first and starts punching him repeatedly.

Randy's eyes drift in Cassidy's direction.

RANDY'S POV: Cassidy is CRYING.

Randy turns back to The Ayatollah.

Randy flips The Ayatollah over. Randy struggles to his feet.

He picks up The Ayatollah and levels him with a dropkick.

His heart is POUNDING. The fans sense it's near the end. A

chant rises:

Randy falls on top of The Ayatollah, putting him in a rest-

move headlock.

The Ayatollah can hear how labored Randy's breathing is.

Randy looks around at the crowd, chanting, hungry for the Ram

Jam. He looks The Ayatollah in the eye.

Randy gets up. He lifts The Ayatollah off the mat, locking up

with him chest-to-chest. He arches his back and thrusts his

hips. The Ayatollah's feet fly off the canvas as his legs

whip into the air. His body does a COMPLETE FLIP as he slams

onto his back. Randy stays with him, his body contorting in a

tight BACK FLIP as he CRASHES DOWN on top of him.

Randy gets up. His HEART LURCHES.

He lowers himself back down to his knees. Puts his hand to

his chest. Something just happened.

Randy looks out at the crowd. The whole place is on its feet.

Randy's heart LURCHES AGAIN.

The Ayatollah sees he's clearly not.

Randy looks out at the crowd again. The fans are in a frenzy.

Randy is torn. He...

GETS UP.

Randy STAGGERS to the corner. His heartbeat is UNNATURAL AND

DEAFENING.

BA-BLOOM, BA-BLOOM, BA-BLOOM...

ON CASSIDY:

Cassidy can't take any more. She turns and WALKS.

ON RANDY:

Randy plants a foot on the bottom rope. He looks toward

Cassidy.

RANDY'S POV: He catches a glimpse of Cassidy disappearing

through the curtain into the locker room.

Randy looks out on the crowd. Chanting, cheering. He starts

to climb. Standing on the top rope, he looks again at the

curtain. She's gone.

HALLWAY:

Cassidy exits the arena sobbing.

THE RING:

The Ayatollah lies on the ground in pain.

ON RANDY:

Randy raises his arms and sticks his elbows out, pressing his

fists to the sides of his head to form a set of RAM'S HORNS.

Randy takes a long look around the auditorium, lingering on

the fans' faces, savoring their cheers.

He SMILES.

BA-BLOOM, BA-BLOOM, BA-BLOOM...

He LEAPS.

FREEZE on Randy in mid-air, glorious and immortal.
