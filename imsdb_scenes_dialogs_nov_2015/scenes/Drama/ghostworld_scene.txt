OPENING TITLE SEQUENCE - EVENING

We MOVE through the city in a series of brief shots that

define and establish our setting, from commercial district

to residential neighborhood. Eventually we find ourselves

moving down a street of two-story apartment buildings. Many

of the windows are lit from within by an EERIE BLUE LIGHT.

As we track past at window-level we see:

A glum, sedated-looking COUPLE watching TV. An ignored TODDLER

runs amok behind them as a cheery commercial plays..

An empty room...

A large, hirsute MAN, wearing only Lycra jogging shorts,

watching the Home Shopping Network while eating mashed

potatoes with his fingers...

A dazed old woman staring out the window.

The silhouette of a TEENAGE GIRL dancing by herself.

We enter her room and see the TV SCREEN. The source of the

THEME MUSIC is A VIDEO of an insane East Indian production

number from the 1960's. The room is cluttered with heaps of

clothes, old records, odd knick-knacks. We see her silhouetted

back as she dances along to the video while trying on a

GRADUATION CAP AND GOWN.

EXT. HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION - AFTERNOON NEXT DAY.

A modern high school auditorium. Over the entrance a banner

with a "Coca Cola" logo reads: "GRADUATION TODAY 2 PM."

INT. HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - SAME DAY

A graduation ceremony is in progress. We DOLLY PAST the bland

faces of teary-eyed graduates until we stop on ENID. At first,

we only see the top of her mortarboard; as she lifts her

head we see that she's trying desperately not to laugh.

She makes eye-contact with REBECCA, another graduate, who is

also trying to stifle her laughter. The SPEAKER is in an

elaborate wheelchair with severe-looking traction devices.

A trio of TEENAGE GIRLS (one white, one Asian, one black)

come running out from the wings and start dancing and rapping.

The audience loves them.

EXT. HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - LATE AFTERNOON

The auditorium door opens and GRADUATES emerge. Enid & Rebecca

run away from the crowd, triumphantly holding rolled up

diplomas. They run toward the school playground, nearly

bursting with excitement over their long-awaited release.

Enid stops and looks back at the school. She gives it THE

FINGER. They sit on a see-saw, out of breath.

Enid opens hers. Instead of a diploma, it's an OFFICIAL

LOOKING DOCUMENT with a pink Post-It note on the front page.

EXT. "DAYS INN" HOTEL - EVENING

The sign reads "Welcome Graduates".

INT. "DAYS INN" HOTEL - EVENING

Party in progress in the "Gold Room". A band plays TOP-40

"lite" rock

CLOSE-UP ON ENID, we see the party from her POV: The six or

seven MOST POPULAR STUDENTS huddle closely together.

MELORRA, an ambitious, incessantly upbeat classmate,

approaches them.

Melorra leaves.

TODD, a friendly but slightly below-average-looking guy,

approaches from behind.

Todd starts to talk again but Enid has noticed something off

to the side.

Enid grabs Rebecca and turns her away from Todd before he

can finish his sentence.

Todd, forgotten, walks away. The singer wails a sappy, maudlin

ballad. Enid spots DENNIS, the class loser, wandering around

by himself.

INT. THE QUALITY CAFE - DAY

The QUALITY CAFE is Enid and Rebecca' s hangout. A 50-ISH

MAN with shaved head, and his VAGUELY DIABOLICAL WIFE sit

eating lunch. Enid is drawing a picture of them in her

sketchbook when Rebecca arrives.

REBECCA turns and makes eye contact with MR. SATANIST. She

calmly turns back to face Enid before cracking up.

Enter JOHN ELLIS, an obnoxious young man with a perpetual

smirk.

He puts a videotape on the table, just out of reach.

As the SATANISTS walk outside, they open umbrellas, even

though it's a bright, sunny day.

The girls get up to follow them. Enid grabs the videotape.

EXT. QUALITY CAFE - DAY

Under harsh, glaring sunshine, the girls follow a half-block

behind the SATANISTS.

EXT. ACROSS FROM WOWSVILLE - TEN MINUTES HAVE PASSED

The SATANISTS continue slowly along with Enid & Rebecca still

following.

EXT. WOWSVILLE DINER - CONTINUOUS

Enid points at the mini-mall in front of them. A new

restaurant - we see their banner: "GRAND OPENING. WOWSVILLE -

THE AUTHENTIC 50'S DINER".

INT. WOWSVILLE DINER - DAY

They're in a booth looking at menus. It's a less accurate

version of "Johnny Rockets". A golden oldie from the 80's

plays on the jukebox.

The WAITER approaches. He has an ostentatious 70's-style

perm.

Al leaves.

INT. WOWSVILLE DINER - TEN MINUTES LATER

Enid spots an abandoned newspaper, THE FREE WEEKLY, on the

adjoining table.

Al returns with their food.

Al leaves. Enid goes back to the paper.

Enid tears out the ad and puts it in her sketchbook.

CU of sketchbook.

INT. OOMIE'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING

Enid and Rebecca sit with Rebecca's grandmother OOMIE in her

living room. They eat TV dinners while watching Oomie's

favorite TV SHOW, which we hear but don't see.

LAUGH TRACK. Enid leans toward Rebecca.

Enid and Rebecca exit.

INT. REBECCA'S ROOM - EVENING

Rebecca looks through Enid's sketchbook while Enid fiddles

with the remote, fast-forwarding through a tape in the VCR.

Sound of FAST-FORWARDING. Rebecca glances up from the

sketchbook.

Enid stops fast-forwarding. We don't see the screen but we

hear weird sounds like BOOTS WALKING THROUGH DEEP MUD.

Enid lurches forward to avert her gaze. She clicks off the

VCR, but leaves the TV on. She notices a PHOTO ALBUM on a

bookshelf under the television.

ANGLE ON ALBUM as she leafs through it. We see a picture of

a FIVE-YEAR-OLD ENID with glasses.

ANGLE ON PHOTO of ELEVEN-YEAR-OLD ENID & REBECCA at a party.

ANGLE ON PHOTO of MAXINE.

Something on TV catches Rebecca's eye.

A dead-pan comedian, JOEY McCOBB, is doing his stand-up

routine in a standard brick-wall comedy venue. He has a

contrived "I'm a weirdo" shtick.

Rebecca turns the page of Enid's sketchbook to the torn-out

personal ad.

Rebecca goes to the phone and offers the receiver.

As Enid hangs up they both start laughing.

EXT. SIDEWINDER - DAY

A franchise convenience store with a western motif.

INT. SIDEWINDER - DAY

JOSH, 19, is taking his apron off as his BOSS, a humorless

Greek immigrant, counts out the cash register. Cheerful Muzak

plays.

Enid (wearing wraparound shades) & Rebecca enter.

Rebecca giggles. A customer, DOUG, enters: a lowly specimen

with bad hair-cut, mustache, and jail-house tattoos, wearing

filthy designer jeans and no shirt.

Doug brings a 40-ouncer to the counter. Josh has two packs

of Newports waiting for him.

Doug pays.

Enid looks at herself in the security mirror. She takes off

her hat and messes up her hair. She then takes off her shades

and replaces them with her standard horn-rims.

Outside we see Doug practicing with nunchuks and drinking a

beer. Heavy metal music blares from his car radio. The BOSS

sees this and goes out to yell at him.

Josh joins Enid & Rebecca on the other side of counter.

EXT. JOSH'S CAR - DAY

Josh is driving, chauffeur-like, with the two girls relaxing

in the back seat.

Enid and Rebecca giggle.

EXT. GAFFEY STREET - DAY

Their car accelerates.

INT. WOWSVILLE DINER - 12:35 PM.

The three of them are seated at a corner booth. A song from

any decade other than the 50's PLAYS on the jukebox. A

BUSINESSMAN enters.

WEIRD AL approaches with menus.

Rebecca puts her hand over Enid's mouth.

A PUSH SWEEPER, SWEEPING THE CARPET.

ANGLE ON: OLD WOMAN slowly sweeping.

WE FOLLOW HER BACK TO: Enid, Rebecca & Josh. They're now

eating: ten minutes have passed, it's 12:45.

REBECCA laughs.

A GUY enters.

The GUY joins a friend.

They see a somewhat funny-looking guy in his late 30's,

wearing a green cardigan, SEYMOUR, enter. Enid and Rebecca

hunch down in their seats.

Seymour sits down and looks around. Weird Al brings a menu.

ANOTHER ANGLE ON: WEIRD AL bringing his milkshake. Ten more

minutes have passed, it's 12:55.

Fifteen more minutes have passed - it's 1:10 PM. Seymour

looks around, still hopeful. His date is now TEN MINUTES

LATE.

Rebecca turns around and pretends to look past Seymour.

It's now 1:30 PM. His date is 30 MINUTES LATE. Seymour gets

up and walks sadly towards the cashier (Weird Al).

They watch him leave. Enid goes up to pay the bill while

Josh and Rebecca go outside.

Enid goes back to the table to leave a tip, two dollars. Al

passes behind her.

Enid hesitates, overcome with guilt. She glances back at Al,

then digs every penny out of her pocket (about seven dollars

in coins and wadded up bills) and adds it to his tip.

EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY

The trio drive in silence. Suddenly, an extra-wide pick-up

vrooms past Josh, cutting off the driver (SEYMOUR) next to

him. SEYMOUR bobs violently as he screams silent obscenities.

ANGLE ON: SEYMOUR really having a fit now. Once it's out of

his system, he reverts to an amiable poker-face.

EXT. SEYMOUR'S APARTMENT - DAY

Several minutes have passed. Seymour parks.

Seymour gets out and disappears up the steps of his building.

INT. EXPERIMENTAL FILM - DAY

FULL SCREEN: grainy B&W video footage. The CAMERA travels up

a shadowy flight of stairs. We hear FOOTSTEPS, a rhythmic

POUNDING, and a deranged CHILDREN'S CHOIR ("LALALALALALA").

The CAMERA reaches the top of the stairs, we see a door that

slowly CREAKS open. We move into the room beyond, it's

decorated with stuff from the 50's and a giant crucifix. We

HEAR a televangelist's sermon. We MOVE CLOSE on a little

girl's doll. Very slowly a MAN'S HAND reaches for the doll

and drags it into the shadows. The hand throws the now

mutilated doll into a toilet; water and blood swirl around.

We see grainy footage (shot off of TV) of Christians angrily

picketing an abortion clinic. CREDITS come up: THE END.  A

FILM BY ROBERTA ALLSWORTH.

INT. ART CLASS - DAY

The lights go on, the VIDEO ends and the monitor is shut

off.

There are about a dozen students, mostly pimply 14-year-old

boys, a few 14-ish girls, and Enid, dressed in schoolgirl

outfit. The teacher, ROBERTA ALLSWORTH, addresses the class.

EXT. SEYMOUR'S NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

Enid and Rebecca stand in front of Seymour's apartment.

A pause.

EXT. SEYMOUR'S BUILDING - MAILBOX

There are three mail slots. Enid pulls the mail out of the

first one. We see FLOWER BULB CATALOGUES, and LADIES HOME

JOURNAL.

She grabs the mail out of SLOT NUMBER TWO.

Rebecca is looking at the mail from SLOT NUMBER THREE.

She shoves back the contents of slot number two and grabs

the mail from Rebecca. We hear MALE VOICES around the corner.

Enid jams the mail back in the slot in a panic.

They slowly walk around the bushes toward the voices.

INT. SEYMOUR & JOE'S GARAGE SALE - DAY

They see the GARAGE SALE, in progress. They've all spotted

each other.

A middle-aged HOUSEWIFE browses with little enthusiasm as

Enid & Rebecca tentatively approach. Enid spots a MONGOOSE

VS. COBRA taxidermy piece near Joe...

Joe shuts off the TV. He turns to the girls, not wanting to

lose the rapport he's established with two potential

customers.

He picks up a plastic Casio-type guitar/keyboard (a child's

toy) and starts noodling pre-programmed rock licks.

She notices several modern jazz LPs on Joe's table.

Enid glances at Rebecca and mouths the implausible name:

"Seymour?!" Rebecca snorts, unable to control her laughter,

and turns away from the table. Enid keeps her cool...

Enid drifts over and begins thumbing through a box of 78s.

He points her to a nearby box of LPs.

Rebecca tugs on Enid's sleeve. Enid gets free and continues

looking through the records. She stops on one with an

especially wacky cover.

He pulls out a bland-looking record: "COLLECTOR'S ITEMS,

VOLUME THREE." Rebecca shifts impatiently behind her.

Rebecca snorts at Enid's over-exuberance. Enid kicks her.

She pays him.

He puts the record into a bag.

INT. QUALITY CAFE - DAY

Enid & Rebecca sit in their usual booth. Rebecca is reading

THE FREE WEEKLY.

Rebecca starts looking through the APARTMENT LISTINGS. She

takes a pen out of her purse.

Awkward silence. Melorra enters.

Enid and Rebecca look at each other.

Melorra leaves quickly.

They watch her cross the street - she's dressed in expensive

"casual" clothes with a fancy backpack.

INT. ENID'S BATHROOM - DAY

Loud water running; PUNK ROCK blares from adjoining bedroom

as Enid, her head in the sink, sings along, making up her

own words. As she straightens INTO FRAME, we see that she's

dyed her hair green. She grabs a towel and heads into the

bedroom.

INT. ENID'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Her DAD enters with a mixing bowl, oblivious to the green

hair and loud music.

Dad leaves. Enid messes up her hair in different ways while

singing along to the tape and looking at herself in the

mirror. Rebecca opens the door and stands in the doorway.

Enid turns around, startled, but instantly regains helps

composure.

EXT. COMMERCIAL AREA/NEAR ACME SHOES - DAY

They walk past a sad-looking ACME SHOES AND REPAIR STORE, in

a distinctive old building, that looks as if it's been there

forever. They stop and peer through the window.

They continue walking.

We see a pair of discarded jeans on the sidewalk.

They see a MIDDLE-AGED MAN dressed in a shabby threadbare

suit and hat sitting at what was once a bus stop. The rusty

sign has a red sticker on it that says "No longer in service."

Enid sits next to THE MAN. Rebecca stands behind the bench,

taken aback that Enid is going to end the long standing

speculation.

EXT. JOSH'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Enid & Rebecca are on the outside porch/walkway on the second

floor of Josh's building. Enid POUNDS on his pasteboard door;

the windows RATTLE with each hollow THUD.

Enid finds a piece of paper - the back of a pizza flyer.

She writes, while Rebecca looks over her shoulder. "Dear

Josh. We came by to fuck you but you didn't answer the door.

Therefore you are gay. Signed, Tiffany and Amber."

Enid pushes the note over his doorknob.

EXT. ENTERING ZINE-O-PHOBIA BOOKSTORE - DAY

INT. ZINE-O-PHOBIA BOOKSTORE - DAY

They enter. We see racks of books-with titles like "Make

Explosives At Home." Rebecca walks over to the magazine rack.

John Ellis emerges from the back and begins to unload a box

of books onto the shelves. He stops and looks at Enid.

She wads up a twenty-dollar bill and throws it at him.

He heads toward the back room with the empty box.

He exits. Rebecca walks over to Enid.

INT. ENID'S BEDROOM/BATHROOM - EVENING

Enid dejectedly enters and heads straight for the bathroom.

She rummages through a cabinet until she finds the right box

(black hair dye). She wets her hair, then goes into the

bedroom and mechanically turns on her boom box. The punk

rock song we heard earlier plays. She yanks out the tape and

flings it away. She skims through her records and CDs,

dismissing them all. She notices Seymour's bag in the corner.

She takes out the record and puts it on. The first tune is

an upbeat instrumental number. She returns to the bathroom.

Several minutes pass. TRACK TWO begins on the LP. She (and

we) slowly begin to take notice. It's a strange, haunting

old BLUES RECORD. We see that the tune has struck a nerve.

INT. ENID'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

The song continues. Enid sits in her bean-bag chair. Her

hair is now dyed back to black. As the song ends, she picks

up the needle and starts it again.

INT. SEYMOUR & JOE'S GARAGE SALE - DAY

Seymour exits. An uncomfortable pause as Enid stands at the

table. She touches the mongoose's tooth.

Seymour returns with the 78, holding it like a precious

object.

Seymour passes the 78 to Enid who follows suit and holds it

carefully by the edges.

Enid pretends to drop the record.

She hands the record back to Seymour, who's shaken and

embarrassed.

INT. ART CLASS - DAY

Starts with a PAN ACROSS a wall of unimpressive high school

art: dumb drawings of fighting Chuck Norris-types, traced

centerfolds, highly sexualized horses, etc. And, on a table,

a wire sculpture made from two coathangers.

Enid enters late and puts her sketchbook on the table.

Roberta peruses some of the art, then points to a very violent

drawing.

No response from Phillip. Roberta nicks up Enid's sketchbook

and leafs through it.

We see several sketches, including the drawing of the

SATANISTS. Roberta shows a few pages to the class.

MARGARET glances over at Enid. Enid gives her a dirty look.

INT. "MASTERPIECE VIDEO" STORE - AFTERNOON.

On a monitor, a generic trailer is playing.

WE SEE Enid & Rebecca, dressed up in sexy outfits.

She pulls out a small porcelain figure of a MAN FLUSHING

HIMSELF DOWN A TOILET with the words "Goodbye Cruel World"

on the base.

Rebecca picks up another tape.

An obnoxious SIX-YEAR-OLD tries to get his PARENTS to add

another tape to their already tall stack. He stares at the

video monitor.

Another MASTERPIECE EMPLOYEE reshelves videos near them.

They walk by him.

INT. SEYMOUR & JOE'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING

A depressing COLLECTORS' GET-TOGETHER in progress. Enid &

Rebecca sit on an old sofa in the corner. Nine or ten RECORD

COLLECTORS mill about.

Enid & Rebecca are sitting nearby.

ANGLE ON: Joe stands talking to GERROLD, an obnoxious, pushy,

fast-talking guy who keeps eyeing Rebecca. He shovels food

into his mouth as he speaks.

Gerrold walks over to where Rebecca is sitting. He sits on

the arm of sofa next to her.

Enid goes over to the beer keg. Nearby Seymour stands talking

to PAUL - a humorless, middle-aged guy in a suit and tie

who's contemptuously examining one of Seymour's 78s.

Enid approaches them.

INT. SEYMOUR'S BEDROOM - EVENING

Enid & Seymour enter his inner sanctum, beverage containers

in hand -- nicely-displayed old collectibles cover just about

every inch of wall space.

Enid writes her name in the dust.

EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

As Enid and Seymour walk. A 20-ish secretary-type passes.

A breasty, overweight 40-year-old walks by.

They walk by "the pants."

He's sitting as before at the defunct bus stop.

Norman nods politely. Seymour looks quizzically at Enid.

EXT. CITY STREET/NEAR SIDEWINDER - DAY

They're in another part of town near THE SIDEWINDER.

INT. SIDEWINDER - DAY

They enter. Josh has his back to the counter as he makes a

complicated frozen yogurt sundae for a little girl.

He turns around non-chalantly, holding the sundae. He looks

up and sees Enid with the guy from Wowsville (Seymour).

Josh is startled and drops the sundae. The girl starts crying.

Josh immediately starts to clean up the mess. Enid, satisfied,

heads with Seymour for the door.

As the door closes, we hear a familiar voice.

EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

Enid & Seymour continue walking.

They are in front of STAN'S, a porno shop.

INT. ANTHONY'S II - DAY

Enid & Seymour enter. There are a half dozen MEN browsing

through the videos and magazines.

Enid runs over and grabs a BLOW-UP SEX DOLL. Everyone in the

store looks at them. Seymour blushes and sweats.

She looks around, over-stimulated.

She picks up a magazine.

ANGLE ON a pair of THIGH-HIGH LEATHER FETISH BOOTS.

WIDER ANGLE: She's in another part of the store near the

CASHIER.

She spots something and gasps. She yells across the store.

Everyone looks at Seymour as he sheepishly approaches. He

takes out his wallet.

INT. THE COFFEE EXPERIENCE - LATE AFTERNOON

Rebecca is at the counter serving a long line of YUPPIES. We

can see a sign next to the counter that reads: "Answer today's

trivia question and get a free small coffee".

Enid is next wearing a RUBBER BONDAGE MASK with devil horns.

FELDMAN is in line behind Enid. He's a poodle-haired, fedora

wearing eccentric in a motorized wheelchair-golf cart

contraption.

Enid is in the way. She reads it to him.

Feldman grunts and starts to tap away on his powerbook while

Rebecca, rolling her eyes, goes to get his coffee. A DIGITAL

GRAPHIC of the FEMALE FORM on his computer screen. With a

few keyboard strokes he zeroes in on a schematic of the

REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM. An area behind the cervix BLINKS.

He takes his coffee and putters towards the door.

YUPPIE #2 pays and leaves.

INT. ENID'S APARTMENT - DAY

Enid and her dad are eating breakfast. A 13" TV sits on the

kitchen counter behind them.

Pause.

INT. COLLEGE COFFEE HOUSE DAY

Enid and Rebecca sit in a semi-crowded college hang-out.

The guy, a COLLEGE SOPHOMORE, walks by them with two friends.

An earnest "ALTERNATIVE-ROCK" GUY approaches Rebecca. He

hands her a flyer.

Enid takes the flyer from Rebecca.  There are a bunch of

bands listed.

INT. ENID'S FANTASY - EVENING

Starts on full moon in night sky, framed right --

...a dark moonlit room. Enid lies on her stomach in bed. We

MOVE IN CLOSER to her head as though entering her thoughts,

which slowly fade in: WE MOVE TOWARD a vertical sliver of

light -- a cracked-open bathroom door.

WE MOVE into the bathroom and see Enid taking a shower. Josh

enters, dressed in a black suit, holding a large bouquet of

flowers. CUT. We start again, exactly as before, only without

the flowers. He starts to take off his clothes. CUT. He enters

again and gets right in the shower, fully clothed.

They begin to kiss. After a passionate moment, the door opens.

Rebecca stands there, stunned.

CUT BACK TO:

We see only the slightest trace of Enid in the darkness. She

sighs.

INT. ART CLASS - DAY

CLOSE-UP ON a charcoal portrait of DON KNOTTS.

She moves on.

Class GIGGLES.

Enid gives Margaret another dirty look.

EXT. SEYMOUR'S CAR - DUSK

Seymour drives. Enid plays with the radio stopping on an

obnoxious AM Disc Jockey.

She changes the subject and holds up a 78 record.

Seymour waits at a stop sign for two OBLIVIOUS OVERWEIGHT

WOMEN, each with TODDLERS and baby carriages, to cross..

EXT. BLUES CLUB - NIGHT

A marquee reads, "TONITE: BLUESHAMMER also FRED CHATMAN"

INT. BLUES CLUB - NIGHT

FRED CHATMAN, age 82, plays an acoustic blues number. He's

good, but he's being politely ignored for the most part by

the TWENTY-SOMETHING PATRONS. Most of them are more interested

in a baseball game showing on a big-screen TV.

FRED finishes to POLITE APPLAUSE. An M.C. takes the mic.

A CUTE GIRL, mid-20's, stands near their table sipping her

drink. Enid nods in her direction for Seymour's benefit as

if to say, "check it out."

Enid gets up before Seymour can stop her and talks to CUTE

GIRL who looks back at Seymour and smiles. She goes to join

him. Enid walks off in the direction of the bar, giving

Seymour a "thumbs up."

ANGLE ON: Enid standing alone at the bar. We see Seymour and

Cute Girl from her POV. Her gaze drifts to the other people

in the bar. WE MOVE OVER the faces of all the guys and stop

on a skinny, introverted-looking guy with a pool-cue. He

makes a shot and instantly goes into an ostentatious cue

twirling routine. Her gaze drifts on.

She sees herself in a mirror behind the bar and takes off

her hat reconfiguring her hair. She reaches into her purse

and puts on a bulkier pair of glasses. This is interrupted

by BLUESHAMMER taking the stage. Young, white, cocky, pretty

boys.

A din of loud noise. CUTE GIRL immediately leaps to her feet,

boogeying to the music.

Several horny ALPHA MALES press in on Seymour (who's still

sitting), spilling his drink as they vie to dance with her.

Seymour extricates himself from the table and walks toward

the bar where Enid sits.

INT. SEYMOUR'S CAR - NIGHT

INT. SEYMOUR'S APT. - NIGHT

Enid walks in behind Seymour.

INT. SEYMOUR'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

They both have drinks now. He puts on a jazz record, an

instrumental.

Enid finds a PAINTING leaning in a pile of stuff against the

wall in the corner. It's an old-fashioned cartoony stereotype

of a black man's head, with big lips and a huge toothy smile.

He takes out a scrapbook.

She looks through the scrapbook - we see the Coon Chicken

logo transform first into a less stereotyped black man, then

into an older distinguished black chef with the logo "Cook's

Chicken Inn." Then to a white version of the same chef,

followed by a female white chef, then to a streamlined 90's

version. On another page is a collection of cosmetic labels

tracing the design evolution of a different company.

The record ends. Seymour gets up to take it off the turntable.

He puts on another record.

Enid puts down the scrapbook, stares at the painting.

INT. ART CLASS - DAY

We see another wall of student art dominated this time by

Enid's (Seymour's) 3' x 4' painting.

More kids respond at once. Even Margaret is confused.

A long pause as Roberta and the class stare at the painting.

INT. REBECCA'S ROOM - EVENING

Enid is lying on her back with her head on Rebecca's stomach.

Both stare blankly at the ceiling.

INT. PACIFIC THEATER - AFTERNOON

Enid is behind the candy counter dressed in a brown and orange

uniform.

A customer, an ALCOHOLIC LOSER, approaches the candy counter.

LOSER stares blankly, hesitates, then goes into theater.

ANOTHER ANGLE - an hour has gone by.

INT. THE COFFEE EXPERIENCE - DAY

Rebecca is behind the counter glaring at Enid.

An angry CUSTOMER returns with her drink.

EXT. ENID'S GARAGE SALE - DAY

It's the next day. Enid has set up a GARAGE SALE in front of

her apartment building. Rebecca arrives.

A trendy young HIPSTER happens along and looks through the

clothes, then to the table where he picks up a ridiculous

looking stuffed animal.

The HIPSTER looks around a little more and then leaves.

A couple is browsing. The GIRL, a severely skinny, CLUBHOPPER

TYPE in platform shoes looks at the clothes; the BOY, a long

haired SKATEBOARDER, goes through her records.

Enid turns to the boy - he's holding some records and a book.

They stomp off.

EXT. ENID'S GARAGE SALE - DAY

Twenty minutes later. Most of the stuff is gone. Enid packs

up one last box to carry inside.

She heads toward the stairs with the box. Rebecca watches

her go.

INT. SEYMOUR'S ROOM - EVENING

Enid presents Seymour with a HOSTESS CUPCAKE with a single

lit candle in the center. The lights are off.

He leans forward and blows out the candle, then abruptly

straightens up and holds the small of his back in pain. Enid

turns the lights back on.

She notices him adjust something under his shirt.

He gets up and looks through his shelves for a record.

The phone RINGS. Seymour ignores it.

After several more RINGS the machine picks up and we hear

Seymour's message. After the BEEP there's a long fumbling

pause...

INT. ENID'S APARTMENT - ABOUT 10 PM

Enid enters - a light is on in the kitchen.

She walks slowly to the kitchen - a suspenseful moment. She

sees, first, her Dad (wearing an apron) and then, a hauntingly

familiar MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN.

INT. ART CLASS - DAY

A toothy, zit-covered 14-YEAR-OLD BOY poses with a very poorly-

made sculpture. A flash goes off and he jumps slightly,

sending pieces of his sculpture flying.

It's Roberta, taking photos. She moves on to Enid, in front

of her big painting.

Enid ad-libs a weird expression as... the flash goes off.

Roberta now turns to address the class.

A long "poignant" pause as she smiles admiringly at them.

The students get their things together and file out.

She gives her a booklet and an application form.

INT. INDOOR SHOPPING MALL - DAY

Enid & Rebecca are in a Crate & Barrel-type store looking at

housewares.

Rebecca spots some particularly fetching dishware.

INT. DANA'S APARTMENT - EVENING

Seymour is just finishing the dinner DANA has cooked for

them at her place. Dana is an attractive redhead, about 40.

Dana heads for the kitchen. Seymour gets up to relieve his

backache. He walks over to a framed photo on the wall.

She drags him around. He's still holding his ice cream.

She takes his ice cream and puts it on a table.

She shuts off the stereo as he sits and eats his ice cream.

INT. ENID'S ROOM - EVENING

It's 9:30 PM. Enid is drawing in her sketchbook. She looks

impatiently at the phone. Time passes - it's 11 PM. She can't

stand it anymore.

INT. SEYMOUR'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Seymour picks up the phone. Dana is in the background getting

some ice in the kitchen.

He hangs up. Enid is stunned... Now what? She calls Rebecca.

INT. OOMIE'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Rebecca is sitting on the couch in her pajamas when the phone

RINGS. She picks it up.

Rebecca hangs up. Clearly, she's not going anywhere.

EXT. JOSH'S APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT

Enid stands outside Josh's door. A tentative pause; then she

knocks. Josh opens the door, stunned. Enid is wearing an

uncharacteristically "sexy" outfit.

INT. JOSH'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

She goes in and looks around nervously... the note (Tiffany

& Amber) is tacked to the wall.

Pause. Enid sits down on futon/sofa.

He picks up half-finished beer and drinks self-consciously.

Josh doesn't respond - there's another awkward pause.

He sits, tentatively. Long pause.

Stunned pause, then she bravely leans forward and kisses

him.  He kisses back but she is clearly the aggressor...

they get more and more into it.

INT. JOSH'S APT. - 1 AM.

Later, post-coital on the now unfolded futon... Enid lies on

her back, Josh is face-down on top of her with his head to

the side. Enid has a blank, disillusioned stare.

INT. JOSH'S APARTMENT - DAY

It's the next morning. Josh is asleep. Enid, fully awake and

dressed, sits on the bed looking at him, thoroughly

disillusioned. She pulls out a record from his collection

and grimaces. She opens a closet door and finds an electric

guitar.

INT. REBECCA'S ROOM - DAY

Rebecca is dressed in her best apartment-hunting outfit. She

sits on her bed, dialing the phone with the FREE WEEKLY open

on her lap. She circles something with her pen while the

phone rings.

INT. ENID'S BEDROOM -DAY

Enid lies perfectly still on her bed, staring at the ceiling

while the phone rings.

EXT. COOK'S CHICKEN INN - DAYTIME

Establish the restaurant.

INT. COOK'S CHICKEN INN - DAYTIME

Seymour sits alone eating lunch. We see Enid approach

stealthily from behind.

She sits across from him.

Seymour looks again at his watch.

Suddenly, Dana enters.

Dana sits next to Seymour, facing Enid.

Seymour begins to stammer some kind of response.

INT. ENID'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT EVENING

Enid is in her room getting dressed. Dad enters.

INT. COMMUNITY CENTER - EVENING

A homemade banner reads: "HIGH SCHOOL ART SHOW - BROTHERHOOD

AND COMMUNITY: ART AS DIALOGUE." Along one wall is all the

work from Roberta's class: a collection of eccentric abstract

bric-a-brac and Enid's large painting. The painting has drawn

a small crowd. We see a chain of events beginning with three

PARENTS talking to a matronly DIRECTOR/CURATOR who in turn

seeks out Roberta (wearing make-up and fancy-ish clothes for

the first time).

She marches towards it. Roberta runs after her.

Roberta sees Margaret and grabs her.

Margaret shrugs "no." ROBERTA looks through the crowd. A

college-age news-hack-type with a FREE WEEKLY T-SHIRT snaps

a photo of the DIRECTOR removing Enid's painting.

EXT. SEYMOUR'S APT. BLDG. - EVENING

Enid, dressed as though for a glamorous date, stands knocking

on Seymour's door.

INT. SEYMOUR'S PLACE - CONTINUOUS

Enid worms her way past his unwelcoming stance. Seymour is

wearing designer stone-washed denim jeans that look ridiculous

on him. Joe can be seen in the kitchen.

EXT. ENID'S NEIGHBORHOOD - EVENING

A LONG SHOT of Enid as she walks home alone.

EXT. RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

Enid & Rebecca walk down the street. Both wear landlord

friendly J. Crew outfits.

They walk along in conspicuous silence.

A few passersby stop to watch.

INT. ENID'S ROOM - LATER THAT DAY

Enid is on her bed, crying. Her jacket and shoes are strewn

about the floor.

We see her Dad standing outside her bedroom. As he enters he

tries to make enough noise so that she notices him before

she really embarrasses herself. She stops crying and pretends

to be asleep.

Dad sits next to her on the bed and puts his hand on her

shoulder.

Enid pulls away from him and sits up on the opposite side of

the bed, facing away from him

Enid maintains a poker face for several long seconds before

she bursts into tears, utterly defeated.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALL - DAY

Enid, determined, walks down the empty halls. She goes into

a room marked "Art Class".

INT. ART CLASS - CONTINUOUS

Roberta is in there with a bearded EX-HIPPY COLLEAGUE.

They're covering a STUDENT in plaster.

Roberta, absorbed in her plastering, glances at Enid.

Then, realizing who it is...

The PLASTER-COVERED STUDENT makes an uncomfortable moaning

noise.

EXT. QUALITY CAFE - EVENING (SAME DAY)

Enid walks the streets - it's dark out now. She goes by the

Cafe - it's CLOSED FOR REMODELING.

EXT. COMMERCIAL AREA/BUS STOP - LATER

She continues walking until she's across the street from

Norman's bus stop. She sees him there, as always. Suddenly,

a BUS, well-lit from the inside and completely empty, pulls

up to the stop and Norman gets on.

INT. SEYMOUR'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (ABOUT 11 PM)

A knock on the door - Seymour shuffles out in T-shirt, pants,

and goofy slippers. He looks through the peephole and sees

Enid. He opens the door.

Enid goes to look for herself.

She returns from the kitchen with a giant bottle of champagne.

She opens it and drinks straight from the bottle. Seymour's

look says: "Oh well, I'm fucked, I give up."

INT. SEYMOUR'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

Enid & Seymour sit on the bed listening to old records and

drinking out of the bottle.

Enid notices an extremely ugly modern sculpture in the corner.

She goes over and picks it up.

Seymour takes another slug off the bottle.

TEN MINUTES LATER

The bottle is empty.

She kisses him passionately. He's shocked but kisses back.

This escalates, leading to the sex act, shown with merciful

brevity.

WE SEE Enid & Seymour, post-coital.

Enid turns her back to him. We see from REVERSE ANGLE that

she's only pretending to be asleep. She looks troubled, as

though she's just made a big mistake. Seymour puts his arm

around her. It's the only time we've seen him look relaxed

and happy.

He kisses her arm and goes to sleep.

INT. SEYMOUR'S ROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

Seymour wakes up. Enid is gone.

INT. DANA'S OFFICE - EXPANSION REALTY - DAY

Dana is on the phone. A lantern-jawed male COLLEAGUE listens

in, his head pressed up against hers.

Seymour nervously enters her "workspace". Dana is pleasantly

surprised - she stops her conversation.

She hangs up and high-fives her colleague. They bear-hug.

Colleague leaves; Dana turns to Seymour.

Dana sits down, staring ahead, stunned for a moment. Suddenly

she breaks down sobbing.

She starts crying again. Seymour awkwardly tries to comfort

her.

Dana pushes him away violently.

INT. ENID'S ROOM - THE SAME DAY

Enid is now utterly defeated. The phone rings. She lets the

machine pick it up. Maxine enters.

We hear Seymour on the machine in the background...

Maxine leaves. Seymour finishes his message. Enid picks up

the phone and dials.

INT. THE COFFEE EXPERIENCE - DAY

Enid & Rebecca sit at a table. Rebecca is wearing her uniform.

INT. ENID'S ROOM - LATE MORNING

Enid is putting on her shoes. Her Dad opens the door slightly

and sticks his head in.

Just then, three sharp KNOCKS on the front door.

Dad goes to answer the door. Enid hides in her room.

Enid looks out the window and sees Seymour walking away. She

has a terribly sad look on her face.

INT. SEYMOUR'S BEDROOM - EVENING

Seymour sits in dim light, dialing an antique "candlestick"

telephone. In the background, a Peter, Paul and Mary concert

plays on the TV. We hear three rings followed by Enid's

answering machine message. He hangs up before it finishes.

Joe walks by the doorway.

Seymour doesn't answer. He looks away.

Again no answer from Seymour, he stares off into space.

Seymour looks so miserable that even Joe has some compassion

for him.

Joe leaves. Seymour is left listening to the record.

INT. COOK'S CHICKEN HEADQUARTERS - DAY.

Seymour is at work, walking down a carpeted hallway with

many doors on both sides. A door opens and a Tony Robbins-

ish, 35 year-old MANAGEMENT EXECUTIVE sticks his head out.

Seymour enters.

He plunks down the current issue of THE FREE WEEKLY - it's

open to a 1/2 page article on page 8 with the headline "Oh

Brother!" and a photo of THE PAINTING being removed.

INT. ENID & REBECCA'S NEW APT.

Enid is wearing a bright orange "Computer Station" T-shirt

and a yellow vest with a "trainee" tag. She's looking around

at her new home: a hopelessly drab, characterless apartment.

Enid points to a small box with sketchbook, etc.

She drags Enid into the kitchen and opens a BUILT-IN IRONING

BOARD as though it's the most amazing thing she's ever-seen.

INT. ENID'S ROOM - LATE EVENING

Enid is sorting her stuff into boxes. Digging through her

closet, she finds a box that she doesn't recognize. Inside

are her old children's records (45's). She excitedly takes

one out and plays it. She folds her clothes while listening

to this song, which clearly is getting to her. She grabs

mechanically for the next thing hanging in her closet. It's

the uniform from her job at "Computer Station." She folds

it, puts it in the box, then stops, staring at the orange

fabric.

INT. ENID AND REBECCA'S APT. - THE NEXT DAY

Rebecca is nervously arranging and re-arranging her stuff.

She puts up her gigantic new kitchen wall clock and sets the

time to 12:45. She goes to the phone and calls Enid. The

machine picks up and Rebecca hangs up. She does another

tedious, pointless task. IT'S NOW 3:30. She's pissed off and

goes to the phone to call again. As it rings there's a knock

on the door. Relieved, she hangs up and goes to answer.

It's Seymour standing there, not Enid.

Rebecca goes over and gets Enid's sketchbook out of the box

and flips through it. When she gets to the right page she

hands it to Seymour.

We see a pasted-up PERSONAL AD beside a DRAWING OF SEYMOUR

in Wowsville. On the facing page we see a drawing of JOSH

with his name surrounded by RED HEARTS.

EXT. SIDEWINDER - AFTERNOON

Seymour's car screeches into the parking lot. He bursts into

the store, ready for once in his life to make a scene.

INT. SIDEWINDER - AFTERNOON

Josh is behind the counter cleaning the Slurpee machine,

with his back to the entrance, as Seymour storms in. Doug is

over by the magazine rack reading a dirt bike magazine.

Josh turns around - what's going on? He recognizes Seymour.

As he says this he flips over a SMALL DISPLAY RACK of potato

chips. Then he tries to flip over a BIG DISPLAY CASE in front

of the counter but is unable to budge it - he keeps trying

and gets more and more frustrated.

Josh runs from behind the counter to stop him before he

creates a huge mess. He tries to grab Seymour and they get

into a ridiculous frantic scuffle. Seymour starts yelling.

Suddenly Doug appears and gets Seymour in a choke hold with

his nunchucks. Doug ad-libs cop-style jargon. Josh is freaked

out. Seymour realizes what a fool he is and starts to cry.

The Boss comes out of the back room...

INT. ENID & REBECCA'S APARTMENT - AROUND MIDNIGHT

The apartment is dark - lit only by a harsh, annoying

streetlight. Rebecca sits on the couch in sweat clothes,

exasperated. She goes to look out the window. Cars with loud

radios can be heard driving by. She goes to the phone - she

checks it and hangs up. Pause. She picks it up again - one

last try. She dials the number and waits. We hear the BEEP

of the answering machine. Rebecca hangs up.

She gets into a sleeping bag (spread out in the center of a

cold linoleum floor). She zips the zipper all the way over

her head and curls up into a whimpering ball.

INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY

The dialogue begins in voice-over as the title card fades.

We slowly fade in to see Seymour, lying on a pink pastel

psychiatrist's couch, as he speaks to his THERAPIST, a

handsome, well-coiffed woman in her late 40s.

Seymour looks up. She nods toward the large wall clock behind

her: thirty seconds after five. Re gets up and she walks him

slowly toward the door.

A pause. They stand facing each other.

Seymour takes a filled-out check from his shirt pocket. In

the waiting room, we see SEYMOUR'S MOTHER.

As they leave Seymour looks back and smiles weakly at the

doctor.

INT. QUALITY CAFE - LATE AFTERNOON

The Cafe has been FULLY REMODELED and now resembles Wowsville

more than the old Quality Cafe. There are no neighborhood

"characters" anymore, only well-heeled twenty-somethings. We

see that Rebecca is now a waitress here. She tears off a

check and places it in front of a super-muscular, polo shirted

EUROPEAN HIPSTER, who is too busy tapping away at his

POWERBOOK to notice.

She walks toward the end of the counter to total up her

receipts. She looks up and sees Enid, wearing tasteful 1930's

style clothes, sitting across from her.

We see at this point that Rebecca & Enid are no longer

friends, but there are also no hard feelings evident.

Rebecca goes to get it. Enid looks around, bemused and

saddened by what The Quality Cafe has become.

She takes a crumpled envelope from her pocket and pulls out

her DIPLOMA.

Pause. Josh enters. Enid turns around.

For a moment it's not clear who he's talking to, and then:

She finishes, takes off her apron and emerges from behind

the counter. She kisses Josh perfunctorily.

Rebecca & Josh leave. Enid is totally alone in the now-alien

world of the Quality Cafe. A momentary pause as she calmly

stares into her orange juice. We see a small, round TRAVEL

BAG at her feet.

EXT. CITY STREETS/ACME SHOES - EVENING

We see Enid walking down the familiar streets of her world.

It's early evening, quiet except for distant street noises.

She walks toward the old ACME SHOES AND REPAIR STORE. It

looks the same, miraculously preserved, until she stands

right in front of it. She looks through the partially papered

over window and sees WORKMEN inside installing new fixtures:

a modern counter and several small tables, all made from a

FAMILIAR GREEN PLASTIC. A sign in the window reads: "Coming

Soon: Another COFFEE EXPERIENCE.

EXT. CITY STREET - EVENING

She continues walking as the sun has set and there is a calm

stillness to the city. She turns a corner and is startled by

her reflection in a large window made of one-way glass. She

stops and looks at herself. Everything about her looks perfect

for once; no need to change a thing. She moves closer to the

glass and, shading her eyes, tries to look inside.

She continues walking. Darkness is just setting in and she

has the street all to herself.

EXT. COMMERCIAL AREA/BUS STOP - NIGHT

We see Enid at NORMAN'S BUS STOP, sitting on the bench. She

looks at the apartment building across the street. A woman

who has just arrived home from work turns on the TV, bathing

her living room with that EERIE BLUE LIGHT. The same thing

happens in another window down the street... then another...

Enid looks down the street. In the distance A BUS rounds the

corner and heads toward her.

From a third-story window across the street, we see the bus

as it arrives and stops, blocking Enid from view. A moment

later it pulls away, leaving an empty bench. The CAMERA moves

upward, farther and farther away as the music swells and the

credits roll.

EXT. BRIDGE - EVENING

The bus disappears over the crest of the bridge.
