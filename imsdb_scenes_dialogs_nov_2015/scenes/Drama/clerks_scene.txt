INT: BEDROOM. EARLY-MORNING HOURS

A DOG sleeps on a neatly made bed.

A CLOCK reads twenty to six.

A SHELF OF BOOKS holds such classics as Dante's Inferno,

Beyond Good and Evil, The Catcher in the Rye, and The Dark

Knight Returns. A FRAMED DIPLOMA, dusty and unkempt, hangs

askew on the wall. A snapshot of a girl is stuck in the

corner, and a bra weighs one end down. A PHONE sits quietly

atop a bundle of laundry. It suddenly explodes with a

resounding ring-once, twice, three times. A CLOSET DOOR

swings open, and a half-clad figure falls out. THE PHONE

rings yet again, and a hand falls upon the receiver, yanking

it off the trash can, O.C. THE RUMPLED FIGURE lays with his

back to the camera, phone in hand.

THE DOG yawns and shakes its head.

A PICTURE OF A GIRL leans against a trophy. The picture is

decorated with a Play-Doh beard and mustache.

THE PHONE RECEIVER slams into the cradle. THE RUMPLED FIGURE

slowly sits up and remains motionless. He musses his hair

and stands.

THE DOG stands and wags its tail. A hand pats its head. The

Rumpled Figure lays down on the bed. We now see his face. It

is the face of DANTE and this is Dante's room; this is

Dante's life. DANTE grabs the dog and wrestles it.

He releases the dog and sits up.

INT: BATHROOM. MINUTES LATER

A steaming shower fills the room. The dog licks water from

the toilet.

INT: KITCHEN. MINUTES LATER

A towel-dressed DANTE opens the fridge and peers inside. He

grabs a half-empty gallon of milk and closes the door.

INT: KITCHEN. SECONDS LATER

Chocolate milk mix is heaped into a tumbler. One scoop, two

scoops, three scoops, four scoops.

INT: BEDROOM. A MINUTE LATER

DANTE gulps his breakfast while feeling inside the closet

for some clothes. Some chocolate milk spills on the floor.

THE DOG laps at the small puddle of chocolate milk.

INT: HALLWAY. MINUTES LATER

DANTE'S feet are hastily covered. A hand grabs keys from

atop a VCR.

EXT: DRIVEWAY. MINUTES LATER

A car backs out of the driveway and speeds down the street.

EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING

The car pulls up, with a screech. Feet descend to the ground

from the open door. Keys jam into a lock and pop it open.

DANTE lifts the metal shutter revealing the door. He opens

it and grabs two bundles of papers, throwing them inside the

store.

INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING

A very dark room barely lit by the daylight. Suddenly, the

lights flick on, revealing the glorious interior of the

convenience store. THE CAT looks at DANTE as he passes the

camera quickly. THE PAPER BUNDLE is snapped open with a

knife. Newspapers slam into the appropriate racks. One rack

remains empty. A coffee filter is placed in a metal pot.

Ground coffee follows, and the mix is shoved into place in

the coffeemaker. The switch is flicked and the machine comes

to life. The empty newspaper rack with the heading ASBURY

PARK PRESS seems out of place among all the other stacks of

papers. DANTE rubs his chin and stares, puzzled. He rolls

his eyes as it occurs to him.

The register pops open, and a hand extracts a quarter.

EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING

POV: NEWSPAPER MACHINE

Through murky glass and thin metal grating, we see DANTE

approach. He stops and drops a quarter in the slot. He pulls

the door down, finally allowing us a clear view as he

reaches toward the camera.

DANTE pulls a stack of newspapers from the Asbury Park Press

vending machine. He struggles to hold them all in one hand

as he lets the door slam shut. He turns to walk away, but

the sound of the quarter dropping into the change slot stops

him. He takes a step back to grab the coin.

INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING

The papers drop into the once-empty rack with a resounding

flop. The quarter drops back into the register drawer.

EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING

DANTE tries to jam the key into the window shutter lock. He

looks down at it.

The lock is gummed up with gum or something hard and

obtrusive like gum, preventing the key from being inserted.

DANTE looks around and kicks the shutter angrily. The car

trunk pops open and a hand reaches inside, pulling out a

folded white sheet.

INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING

A can of shoe polish is grabbed from the shelf. DANTE dips

his fingers into the shoe polish and writes large letters on

the unfurled sheet, leaning on the cooler.

EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING

DANTE stands on a garbage can and tucks a corner of the

sheet under the awning. He jumps down. The banner reads I

ASSURE YOU, WE'RE OPEN. The door sign shifts from CLOSED to

OPEN.

INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING

The clock reads 6:20. DANTE leans behind the counter, the

morning routine completed. He stares ahead, catatonic, then

drops his head in his hands. The day has begun.

EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

The store, with its makeshift banner looming in the dim

morning hour, just after dawn. A car drives by.

INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

DANTE waits on a customer (ACTIVIST) buying coffee.

The ACTIVIST leans on a briefcase and drinks his coffee.

Another CUSTOMER leans in the door.

The ACTIVIST lifts his briefcase onto the counter. He opens

it and extracts a sickly-looking lung model.

The ACTIVIST hands him something from the briefcase.

Hands him a picture.

The CUSTOMER exits.

Another CUSTOMER comes up to the counter.

EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

A blank wall. JAY steps into the frame, followed by SILENT

BOB. JAY pulls off his coat and swings it into the arms of

SILENT BOB. JAY then throws down with a makeshift slam

dance, spinning his arm and fake-hitting SILENT BOB.

SILENT BOB lights a smoke.

SILENT BOB points to something off-screen.

SILENT BOB nods.

Some girls walk past. JAY smiles at them.

JAY makes blow job faces down an imaginary line of guys,

looking quite like a performing seal. He throws a little

humming sound behind each nod. He then hops up quickly.

A GUY comes up to them.

INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

A SMALL CROWD gathers around the ACTIVIST as he orates. It

has become something of a rally.

The small crowd begins to chant and jeer in DANTE's face.

VERONICA enters and surveys the mess. The CROWD throws

cigarettes at DANTE, pelting him in the face. Suddenly, a

loud blast is heard, and white powder explodes over the

throng. Everyone turns to face...

VERONICA as she stands in one of the freezer cases, holding

a fire extinguisher.

The CROWD looks among themselves. Someone points to O.C.

The ACTIVIST carries his briefcase surreptitiously toward

the door.

VERONICA jumps off the freezer case, training the nozzle of

the extinguisher on the ACTIVIST.

He reaches into his briefcase. She pokes the extinguisher

nozzle at him, warningly.

He pulls out a business card and hands it to her. She reads

it.

He nods.

He nods again.

He quickly flees. She blasts him with more chemical as he

exits.

The CROWD sheepishly exits, one by one, offering apologetic

glances. DANTE tries to regain his composure.

VERONICA watches the crowd disperse, disgusted.

The last of the crowd exits. VERONICA sets the fire

extinguisher down next to DANTE. DANTE is sitting on the

floor, head in his folded arms.

DANTE is silent.

DANTE remains silent.

DANTE lifts his head and shoots her a disgusted look.

She stares at him.

VERONICA stares at him.

VERONICA looks away.

VERONICA looks back at him.

INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

A NOTE on the counter next to a small pile of money reads:

PLEASE LEAVE MONEY ON THE COUNTER. TAKE CHANGE WHEN

APPLICABLE. BE HONEST.

DANTE and VERONICA are slumped on the floor, behind the

counter. VERONICA holds DANTE in her arms, his head on her

chest. Change is heard hitting the counter.

The door is heard opening and closing-a customer leaving.

Pause. She slaps him.

VERONICA stands, letting DANTE'S head hit the floor.

A handsome young man (WILLAM) is standing at the counter.

VERONICA reacts to him.

A moment of silence as DANTE'S chuckles fade to comprehension.

She counts silently, using fingers as marks. DANTE waits on

a customer in the interim. VERONICA stops counting.

DANTE chases VERONICA down and grabs her by the door.

VERONICA violently lets go of him.

She exits in a huff. DANTE stands there in silence for a

moment. Then he swings the door open and yells out.

Two men who were walking in the opposite direction outside

double back and head in the direction. VERONICA went.

INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

A videocassette encased in the customary black box flips

repeatedly, held by an impatient grasp. The IMPATIENT

CUSTOMER glares at DANTE. Dante studies a copy of Paradise

Lost, making a strong attempt at not noticing the glare.

He storms out. Dante lifts a ring of keys from the counter.

The half-filled trash can swallows the ring of keys.

EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

Another VIDEO-ANXIOUS CUSTOMER leans against the video store

door. A hapless RANDAL drifts by and stops. He glances at

the door, peers inside, and gives the door a tug.

RANDAL walks away. The VERY ANXIOUS CUSTOMER stands like a

sentry at post. The IMPATIENT CUSTOMER storms up.

INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

RANDAL dances in, attempting a soft-shoe routine. He sees

DANTE and stops dead, midshuffle.

A pile of videocassettes is plopped onto the counter, with a

single key on top. RANDAL balances the pile of tapes on his

head.

EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

The IMPATIENT CUSTOMER stops RANDAL.

RANDAL marches off. The IMPATIENT CUSTOMER stares after him.

The VERY ANXIOUS CUSTOMER now sits on the ground, next to

the video store door. RANDAL balances his burden and shoves

the key into the lock. The VERY ANXIOUS CUSTOMER stares as

RANDAL enters the store. The door closes behind him, only to

be held ajar in a gentlemanly fashion a few moments later.

RANDAL smiles.

INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

A coffee filter is shoved into the metal pan and someone

heaps ground coffee on it. We've seen this same routine

before. DANTE crosses back to his post, as RANDAL enters,

tossing the key into the air happily and catching it. He

picks the cat up.

RANDAL heads toward the walk-in door.

INT: BACK ROOM. DAY

POV: VCR

A far-away wall is the only thing we see, but mild gruntings

give away an ascension of sorts. RANDAL'S head rises into

view, as if he's climbing a ladder. He stops and looks into

the lens.

POV: RANDAL

The PELICAN is a VCR that's hooked up to a surveillance

camera. It records quickly. A hand reaches into the frame

and shuts it off.

INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

RANDAL pulls a soda from the cooler.

He walks by a row of snacks and grabs one without looking at

it.

DANTE sits in his seat behind the register. RANDAL grabs a

paper and joins him behind the counter.

THE HEADLINE of the engagement announcement reads, BREE TO

WED ASIAN DESIGN MAJOR.

INT: VIDEO STORE. DAY

RANDAL dials the phone. He holds a list in his hand.

A MOTHER and her SMALL CHILD approach the counter.

Silence. Then...

INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

DANTE carries a litter box to be dumped. He pauses midstrike

and lays it on the ice cream chest. DANTE picks up the phone

and looks at the paper. He dials and waits.

_

A CUSTOMER comes to the counter and waits. He looks at the

litter box. A black cat suddenly jumps into it and starts

pawing around.

DANTE on the phone:

The CUSTOMER watches as the cat takes a huge dump, leaning

on its haunches to accommodate the stinky load.

DANTE on the phone:

DANTE hangs up. He looks at the paper ruefully, shaking his

head. He then sniffs the air.

EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

JAY, SILENT BOB and OLAF lean against wall.

TWO GIRLS join them.

SILENT BOB shakes his head:

OLAF looks quizzically at SILENT BOB.

OLAF makes a metal face.

OLAF looks the girls up and down.

OLAF laughs and shakes his head.

OLAF busts a crimson metal sneer and cackles deeply.

INT: VIDEO STORE. DAY

RANDAL leans back in his chair, staring up at the TV. The

theme to Star Wars plays. He stands, points the remote,

clicks the TV off, and ponders.

EXT: VIDEO STORE. DAY

RANDAL locks the door and walks away, while OLAF sings for

the small crowd.

INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

DANTE is tugging at a can of Pringles potato chips. The can

is stuck on a MAN'S hand.

The can pops off and DANTE staggers back a few steps. The

man rubs his hand.

DANTE steps behind the counter.

The MAN exits as RANDAL enters. DANTE throws the canister

away.

RANDAL follows DANTE as he cleans up around the store.

A BLUE-COLLAR MAN half enters the door.

He goes to the coffee machine and makes a cup of joe.

The BLUE-COLLAR MAN joins them.

The BLUE-COLLAR MAN exits. DANTE and RANDAL remain

respectfully quiet for a moment. An angry WOMAN opens the

door and pokes her head in.

INT: VIDEO STORE. DAY

RANDAL reads a newspaper. An INDECISIVE CUSTOMER studies the

two rental choices she holds. She looks from one movie to

the other repeatedly.

RANDAL hardly stirs and continues to read his paper. The

INDECISIVE CUSTOMER half turns to see if her comment was

even heard. She tries again, but this time with a different

approach.

RANDAL continues to read. The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER tries

harder, then louder and more direct:

RANDAL continues to read.

The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER holds up her rental choices.

RANDAL, as always, reads on.

The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER is a tad flabbergasted, but not put

off.

RANDAL does his level best to not get involved.

The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER challenges him.

RANDAL continues to read his paper, not looking up.

The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER smirks smugly at RANDAL and his

paper. She has caught him.

The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER wears a face that belies utter

disbelief in the audacity of this most lackadaisical video

clerk. The unmoving newspaper illustrates the total

disinterest of the news-hungry RANDAL. The INDECISIVE

CUSTOMER shakes her head in disgust and throws the movies

back onto the wall.

She storms out. RANDAL is offended. He hops over the counter

and whips the door open.

RANDAL closes the door and stands there, momentarily,

totally appalled by her exiting remark, then shakes his head.

He reaches behind the counter and grabs a ring of keys.

Exiting, he locks the door behind him from the outside,

gives it a tug to ensure its security, and storms off in the

opposite direction from the woman.

INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

DANTE is staring, open-mouthed, at something O.C. RANDAL

hurls the door open and immediately launches into his tirade.

An ODD MAN sits on the floor, surrounded by cartons of eggs,

all opened. He grabs a carton from the cooler case, pops it

open, and examines each egg carefully.

RANDAL and DANTE study the O.C. oddity.

The ODD MAN holds an egg up to the light and studies it from

several different angles.

RANDAL snickers at his friend.

A SMOKER steps in.

Dante manages to break his study of the O.C. oddity and

searches for the smokes. The smoker glances at RANDAL and

then at the O.C. oddity.

The ODD MAN is spinning an egg on the floor. The SMOKER

looks at RANDAL.

The ODD MAN places a handkerchief over an egg on the floor.

He quickly whisks the handkerchief away to reveal the egg

still sitting on the floor.

DANTE, RANDAL and the SMOKER stare at the O.C. man.

INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

POV RANDAL: THE EMPTY COUNTER

And then a LITTLE GIRL comes into view, smiling and holding

money. She can't be any more than five.

RANDAL, without looking up from his magazine, completes the

transaction. THE LITTLE GIRL puts a cigarette in her mouth.

RANDAL hands her matches. DANTE returns to the counter as

the girl skips away. Dante holds a price gun.

A female CUSTOMER pops items onto the counter. DANTE rings

her up.

The CUSTOMER stands silently, awaiting something.

RANDAL flips open the magazine's centerfold-a graphic

picture of a woman with her vaginal lips and anus spread

wide open.

RANDAL checks out the centerfold wistfully. DANTE frantically

apologizes to the rapidly exiting CUSTOMER.

The CUSTOMER is gone. DANTE'S pursuit stops at the counter.

DANTE turns on RANDAL.

A WOMAN pulls out gallon after gallon, looking deep into the

cooler for that perfect container of milk.

A series of people standing in various locations throughout

the convenience store, asking truly dumb questions.

END INSERT

DANTE gives RANDAL a shove to shut him up. VERONICA enters

the store, carrying books and something covered with aluminum

foil.

DANTE is suddenly by her side, taking the books from under

her arm.

RANDAL makes loud slurping noises from O.C.

RANDAL walks past the two, and pats VERONICA on the head. He

exits.

She exits. DANTE leans against the magazine rack with his

lasagne, contemplative. RANDAL pops his head in and makes

the loud slurping noise again.

INT: VIDEO STORE. DAY

RANDAL is recommending titles to potential customers.

DANTE opens the door and leans in.

DANTE exits. RANDAL gives his customers the what-did-I-tell-

you look.

INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

THE CAT lies on the counter. Pull back to reveal RANDAL as

he rings up an order. The CUSTOMER pets the cat, smiling.

Dolly over to DANTE, on the phone.

He hangs up. RANDAL joins him.

RANDAL walks away.

DANTE shakes his head in frustration and picks up the phone

again.

RANDAL comes back. DANTE rolls his eyes to the ceiling.

INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

TAPE is rolled around the top of a stick. Laces are pulled

tightly. An orange ball is slapped back and forth by a blade.

The HOCKEY PLAYERS fill the convenience store. Some sit on

the floor or lean against the coolers, but all are either

preparing or practicing. RANDAL enters, wearing his equipment.

DANTE skates to his side.

SANFORD skates up and skids to a halt.

A laid-back hurrah is heard.

EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

The sign on the door reads:

TEMPORARILY CLOSED. BE OPEN AFTER FIRST PERIOD.

The PLAYERS ascend a ladder adjacent to the door, one by one.

ON THE ROOF they jump off the ladder and skate around. More

players join them.

From across the street we get the full, odd perspective: a

store with many men gliding around on the roof.

On the roof DANTE skates and passes with another player.

REDDING stretches, leaning against the sign. RANDAL pulls

his mask on and slaps his glove, urging a shot. SANFORD

skates in and takes a shot, which RANDAL blocks. JAY and

SILENT BOB deal to a player: he drops money over the ledge

and JAY throws up a dime bag. DANTE holds a ball in the

center of the court.

PLAYERS take positions. SANFORD comes to the center and

holds the ball in drop position. DANTE and REDDING face off,

and the ball is in play.

The game begins as the players engage in a savage ballet.

Faces are smashed with sticks, slide tackles are made, shots

are taken, CU's of various players included.

INACTIVE PLAYERS call out encouragement and slander from the

sidelines. More game playing including both goalies getting

scored on and more face-offs.

Below, a CUSTOMER tugs on the convenience store door. He

reads the sign and then backs up into the street, attempting

to peer over the ledge. Above, the game continues.

Below, the CUSTOMER shifts from one foot to the other

impatiently. He grabs the ladder and quickly ascends.

Above, from over the ledge of the roof, we see the head of

the customer peek. Skating feet pass rapidly before him, and

he watches for a moment before calling out.

DANTE skids to the sidelines.

DANTE starts to skate away.

He jumps back into the game.

DANTE skids back to the sidelines to address the CUSTOMER.

Below, a WOMAN pulls at the door. She peers into the store,

face against the glass.

The WOMAN backs up and, shielding her eyes, looks toward the

roof.

Above, DANTE and the CUSTOMER shout down at the O.C. WOMAN.

A new face-off pits DANTE against the CUSTOMER. The ball

drops between the two and DANTE gets flattened. The CUSTOMER

winds up and takes a hard shot. The ball sails off the

court, through the air, and into a faraway yard. DANTE calls

to the sidelines.

SANFORD skates up to him.

DANTE scrambles to the edge and calls over.

DANTE looks around, hyperventilating.

DANTE skates off.

INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

DANTE standing on a ladder, replaces a fluorescent light. An

OLD MAN joins him at the foot of the ladder.

The light in place, DANTE descends the ladder and closes it.

The OLD MAN walks off. DANTE heads back to the counter. The

OLD MAN returns.

The OLD MAN sifts through some papers and a few magazines.

He comes back to the counter.

DANTE glances over and reacts.

DANTE makes the switch.

The OLD MAN walks off. We hear the back door open and close,

then the front door does the same. RANDAL joins DANTE.

Pause. Then...

RANDAL comes back with drinks.

DANTE is visibly taken aback.

INT CAR: DAY

DANTE drives with passenger RANDAL, their backs to the camera.

Silence. Then...

Absolute silence. Then...

DANTE glares at RANDAL. Silence. Then...

EXT: FUNERAL PARLOR. DAY

DANTE and RANDAL walk up the path to the funeral parlor.

EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

A MASSIVE CROWD is outside the store.

EXT: FUNERAL PARLOR. DAY

DANTE and RANDAL run from the front door, closely chased by

a small crowd of angry mourners. Car locks are slammed down.

The car screams away. The pursuing crowd stands in the

middle of the street, shaking their fists, throwing things.

EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. NIGHT

The car pulls up and RANDAL and DANTE get out. Absolutely

nobody is outside.

JAY enters the frame, right next to RANDAL. He aims his butt

at him and farts. RANDAL lunges for him. DANTE grabs RANDAL.

A KID tugs at JAY'S shirt.

RANDAL heads to the video store. DANTE enters the convenience

store and slides the sign to OPEN. After a few seconds, the

IMPATIENT CUSTOMER (guy who lost his keys) appears,

flashlight in hand, scanning the ground.

INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. NIGHT

DANTE rearranges the milk. RANDAL joins him.

DANTE walks away, shaking his head.

They head back to the counter.

The CUSTOMER comes to the counter.

The CUSTOMER lets it sink in, and then leaves in a huff.

DANTE puts up cigarettes.

Another CUSTOMER leans in.

RANDAL spits a mist of water at the customer, drenching him.

The man reacts violently, attempting to grab RANDAL from

over the counter. RANDAL makes no move, but remains untouched.

DANTE plays block.

The CUSTOMER leaves, wiping water from his face. RANDAL

salutes him.

RANDAL exits.

INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY

DANTE waits on a customer (TRAINER). He lifts the gallon of

milk into a paper bag, letting out a slight grunt.

A female customer (HEATHER) leans in the doorway.

A SUITED MAN carrying a notebook comes to the counter.

The SUITED MAN scribbles in his notebook.

The SUITED MAN rips a piece of paper out of his notebook and

hands it to DANTE.

The SUITED MAN exits, with DANTE trying to follow.

The two exit. DANTE, alone, studies his summons. He rubs his

forehead.

DANTE spins, angrily.

His expression softens.

EXT: VIDEO STORE. NIGHT

JAY deals with a customer as SILENT BOB looks on.

JOHN leaves. JAY turns to SILENT BOB.

INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. NIGHT

DANTE and CAITLIN are embracing very tightly. We hold on

them for a few seconds, just to let it sink in. Then...

DANTE hops behind the counter. A customer pays for something

while DANTE continues to talk.

Another customer comes to the counter.

Yet another customer comes to the counter.

EXT: VIDEO STORE. NIGHT

JAY and SILENT BOB lean against the wall.

SILENT BOB walks out of the frame, leaving JAY alone against

the wall. He comes back a few seconds later, carrying a

mini-Walkman with ten-watt speakers. He sets it down on the

ground and turns it on. House music starts playing. Jay-

possessed by the beat-breaks into an impromptu dance, in

which he makes suggestive and often lewd moves. SILENT BOB

leans against the wall.

INT: VIDEO STORE. NIGHT

On counter.

DANTE watches her leave. He then explodes in jubilance.

INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. NIGHT

DANTE looks ahead, dreamily, half-spinning in his chair.

RANDAL enters carrying videos.

DANTE hands him the summons. RANDAL reads it.

DANTE exits. A CUSTOMER comes back to the counter. He pets

the cat.

EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. NIGHT

JAY and SILENT BOB watch as DANTE passes. A small group of

burners are poised around the store door. JAY carefully

writes on a large piece of paper, using a thick marker.

SILENT BOB hands him the scissors. JAY slowly cuts the large

piece of paper. SILENT BOB hands him the tape. JAY snaps off

a few pieces, and plasters the sign to the convenience store

door. It is a large word balloon, and it reads I EAT COCK!

Once in place, he raps on the window. RANDAL looks out, his

face adjacent to the word balloon, making it appear as if he

is saying he eats cock. The small group laughs hysterically.

INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. NIGHT

CAITLIN enters, carrying an overnight bag. RANDAL is watching

his porno. The porno is loud and lewd. CAITLIN stares.

She heads toward the back.

She kisses his forehead and walks away. The MOTHER and SMALL

CHILD (Happy Scrappy) come to the counter.

The SMALL CHILD points at the TV screen.

EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. NIGHT

RANDAL studies the I EAT COCK word balloon. DANTE enters.

The cooler down is heard opening. CAITLIN walks lazily down

the convenience store aisle. She looks very satisfied. DANTE

and RANDAL regard her curiously. She joins them, latching on

to DANTE's arm, lovingly.

RANDAL and DANTE stare at CAITLIN, confused.

DANTE is bewildered.

Everyone is silent. Then...

INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. LATER

THE OLD MAN'S FACE is serene, almost happy, as he lies on a

stretcher. (Same OLD MAN who took a porn mag to the bathroom.)

The body bag zipper is pulled closed. DANTE, the CORONER,

and RANDAL stand around the stretcher-bound body bag. The

CORONER takes notes.

Ambulance attendants join them.

The stretcher is wheeled out. Midway down the body bag,

something protrudes, pushing the bag up. It is an erection.

RANDAL stares at it.

RANDAL and the CORONER stare in disbelief.

RANDAL looks down, anonymously.

The CORONER stares at DANTE.

He exits. DANTE and RANDAL stare at the floor.

EXT: VIDEO STORE. NIGHT

CAITLIN sits in the back of the ambulance, a blanket draped

over her shoulders. An attendant takes her blood pressure.

The doors are closed and the vehicle speeds away. JAY and

SILENT BOB lean against the wall. JAY eats sugar out of a box.

INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. NIGHT

A jar of salsa is invaded by a large corn chip. Once in the

condiment, the corn chip resembles a surfacing shark fin.

Fingers poke at it, bringing it to life-swimming menacingly

to and fro across the jar.

DANTE and RANDAL are on a freezer case. RANDAL pushes this

chip around the jar of salsa. DANTE stares up at the ceiling,

oblivious.

DANTE says nothing.

DANTE says even less than nothing.

DANTE...you know.

RANDAL hops off the freezer case and steps O.C.

RANDAL comes back.

DANTE crosses O.C. RANDAL appears contemplative.

INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. NIGHT

DANTE repairs ripped dollar bills, taping them back together.

JAY enters with SILENT BOB and claps his hands.

SILENT BOB hands weed to JAY.

Exit JAY. SILENT BOB stands there.

SILENT BOB leaves. DANTE shuts his eyes tightly and rubs the

bridge of his nose with his thumb and forefinger, as if in

deep concentration. He suddenly snaps his eyes open.

INT: VIDEO STORE. NIGHT

RANDAL has a heart-to-heart with VERONICA.

VERONICA stares, dumbfounded.

VERONICA storms out.

RANDAL stares after her. A customer stands nearby.

INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. NIGHT

DANTE is on the ground holding his knee. VERONICA stands

above him.

VERONICA kicks him in the other leg. DANTE goes down,

yelling in pain.

VERONICA exits. DANTE lies on the floor alone.

EXT: VIDEO STORE. NIGHT

RANDAL exits and locks the door behind him.

INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. NIGHT

Tight on RANDAL'S face as he steps inside.

Hands clasp around his throat and yank him out of the frame.

DANTE throttles RANDAL, choking him to the ground. RANDAL

throws his fists into DANTE'S midriff, throwing him back

into the magazine rack. RANDAL jumps to his feet as DANTE

comes at him again. RANDAL tumbles into the cakes as

Entenman's products scatter beneath and around him. He grabs

a pound cake and hits DANTE in the head with it, using the

opportunity to scurry down the middle aisle. DANTE leaps at

his feet, and RANDAL grabs the shelves, knocking aspirin

over until RANDAL-shrieking-sprays something in DANTE'S face.

DANTE paws at his eyes. RANDAL grabs Italian bread and

smacks it into DANTE'S face as he rushes him blindly. DANTE

chases him out of the frame. M&M's scatter wildly across the

empty floor, and the ruckus is heard O.C.

DANTE and RANDAL later, out of breath, on the floor. RANDAL

sits up against the candy rack, rubbing his neck. DANTE lies

on the floor, bacon held against a sort of crushed cookies,

ripped-open candies, broken bread, and other damaged goods.

They are both silent. Then...

Silence. Then...

RANDAL gets up, leaving DANTE to contemplate his strong

words alone.

DANTE and RANDAL silently clean up, backs to each other.

DANTE places a mop in the corner. RANDAL pulls on his coat.

They stand in silence. Then...

RANDAL exits. A second later, he reenters and tosses DANTE

the sheet-sign.

He exits. DANTE pushes the sign over from Open to Closed.

DANTE climbs behind the counter. He pops the register open

and starts counting the drawer out. The door is heard opening.

POV JOHN: DANTE counting out the register, not looking up.

A gunshot blasts out. DANTE flies back, his chest exploding.

He stares ahead and slumps to the floor.

JOHN walks behind the counter, stepping over DANTE'S body on

the floor, and takes the money out of the register. He grabs

a paper bag and jams the money in it. He grabs handfuls of

change, shoves it in his pocket, and then quickly exits the

frame. DANTE continues to lie on the floor.

CREDITS

Credits end, and the door is heard opening. A customer comes

to the counter and stands there. He waits, looks around for

a clerk, looks down the aisles.

No reply. He looks around again, and glances at the door to

make sure nobody's coming in. Then he reaches behind the

counter and grabs a pack of cigarettes. He leaves.
