At the age of 49 SIR LAURENCE OLIVIER is at the peak of his

fame. He is handsome and charismatic, and VIVIEN is

scarcely less extraordinary. The Gone With The Wind star

remains classically lovely, flirtatious and captivating.

Individually they are charismatic enough, but together they

are electrifying, seeming to charge the air around them

with the power of their personalities, galvanising anyone

who comes into contact with them.

VANESSA leaps to her feet and PERCEVAL hurries to greet

them as COLIN stands up uncertainly. OLIVIER is all amiable

bluster and bonhomie.

He laughs, but then notices VIVIEN's less than enthusiastic

response. Seeking refuge in some distraction he notices

COLIN hovering by the sofa.

He smiles vaguely and glances at VIVIEN for help.

OLIVIER has no recollection of this and fumbles in his

pockets to cover his confusion, bringing out a packet of

cigarettes and offering them to COLIN with breezy charm.

He turns quickly to PERCEVAL.

He puts an arm around PERCEVAL's shoulders and they

disappear together into Perceval's office.

VIVIEN lingers behind, smiling radiantly at COLIN who looks

dumbly at the packet of cigarettes in his hand. He now sees

they are called "Oliviers". VIVIEN wrinkles her nose in

amusement.

She cups Colin's cheeks with her hands and studies him in

mock awe.

VIVIEN's eyes sparkle. OLIVIER emerges from the office with a

handful of script pages and VIVIEN looks at him slyly,

getting her own back for his tactless over-praise of

Marilyn's charms as she strokes COLIN's cheek.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 22A.

OLIVIER smiles tolerantly, mildly put out at this. MARILYN

takes off her sunglasses and blinks. She takes MILLER's arm

and looks at him adoringly. He bites down savagely on his

unlit pipe.

There is a appreciative laughter from reporters.

The agenda is clear - Marilyn is the dumb blonde and should

act accordingly. But she takes it in her stride, smiling

sweetly.

There is laughter at the reporter's expense.

She looks adoringly at Miller, who smiles vaguely.

This time the laughter is emphatically on MARILYN's side.

One of the reporters turns to VIVIEN.

The reporters laugh with her and OLIVIER smiles graciously.

But as she smiles at him we detect just a flicker of

jealous hurt in her eyes. OLIVIER intervenes quickly to

continue his prepared speech of welcome.

He stops as a REPORTER shouts over him.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 27A.

COLIN can't help looking a little pleased with himself.

The LOCALS look up from their pints, unimpressed.

The darts player, ANDY, doesn't turn. His aim remains

steady.

ANDY doesn't look away from his game.

COLIN tries to impress.

The regulars grin unkindly into their pints. ANDY doesn't

look away from his game, as he offers laconically:

There are supportive snorts of derision from the LOCALS.

COLIN takes it on the chin. BARRY hands him a key.

COLIN takes the key and his bag, just as BARRY adds, with

perfect deadpan timing:

The LOCALS laugh into their beer. COLIN smiles gamely.

MARILYN stares at him for a beat then reads haltingly.

MARILYN drops out of character with a sweet, nervous smile.

There are private grins amongst the actors. OLIVIER smiles

kindly.

Flustered, MARILYN looks at her script.

PAULA leans across, mounting a whispered running commentary

in Marilyn's ear as OLIVIER speaks.

OLIVIER waits patiently.

Every eye is suddenly on Colin. Taking his shock for

stubbornness TREVOR turns to the set and bellows.

Half the crew immediately down tools. COLIN looks on in

horror. SYBIL THORNDIKE frowns in reproach.

COLIN stares at him, frozen.

COLIN drops it as though it was on fire. It clatters to the

stage. SYBIL THORNDIKE bears down on TREVOR majestically.

TREVOR pauses, not at all sure about this, but then shrugs

magnanimously.

He turns to one of his men.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 37A.

DAVE picks up the same chair, moves it approximately six

inches and places it behind SYBIL THORNDIKE, who finally sits

down, her sunny good humour instantly restored.

COLIN blushes violently.

The WAITER nods discreetly and leaves. LUCY looks at COLIN

with a teasing smile.

He looks at her, but there is no hint of mockery in her smile

and he is grateful.

LUCY laughs, COLIN looks hurt.

65 EXT. LUCY'S HOUSE. SUBURBS. NIGHT. 65

65A INT. LUCY'S HOUSE. PARLOUR. NIGHT. 65A

She looks at him shrewdly.

She hears heavy footsteps in the bedroom above.

She gives Colin a swift peck on the cheek as she tidies

herself. A moment later the door opens and Lucy's father, MR.

ARMSTRONG comes in, wearing his dressing gown over pyjamas.

He glances at COLIN with a suspicious smile as he looks at

his daughter.

COLIN and LUCY share a small, private smile. He takes his cue

and stands up.

He offers the surprised MR. ARMSTRONG a confident handshake.

Lost for words they stare at each other for another moment

before MR. ARMSTRONG smiles vaguely then goes. LUCY follows

him with a smile at COLIN. He grins and whispers.

She nods. He follows her out into the hall.

She stops to window shop. MILTON lowers his voice to COLIN.

He looks around anxiously. But then a PASSER-BY suddenly

narrows his eyes and takes a second look. His face lights

up and he shouts -

MARILYN gives him a radiant smile and within seconds is

surrounded by a crowd of SHOPPERS alerted by the fuss. A

feverish excitement grows out of nothing as people come

running to look, pushing and shoving to see.

MARILYN is quickly hemmed in by the heaving mob. To begin

with she enjoys it, smiling and posing happily for the

cameras that appear out of nowhere. But as the crowd press

towards something in the mood of the gathering changes; it

becomes wild and over-excited mood as people scream

Marilyn's name and shove bits of paper to sign in her face.

A WOMAN is pushed to the ground and MARILYN is forced back

against the shop window. COLIN sees a flicker of panic on

her face.

COLIN and ROGER hurl themselves into the crowd doing what

they can to keep the excited fans at bay.

They manage to force a path to the car, drag the door open

and bundle MARILYN and MILLER into the back. MARILYN is

pinned against the door and COLIN has to put his arm around

her shoulders as he helps her in. He hurls himself into the

front, with Milton running alongside the moving car to dive

in beside Marilyn.

People run alongside, hammering wildly on the windows in

violent hysteria.

MILTON does his best to put a cheerful gloss on the chaos.

77 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 77

Take three.

By now there is a panic-stricken edge to her voice.

OLIVIER looks startled. PAULA comes scurrying across.

MARILYN appeals to her, turning away from OLIVIER.

OLIVIER takes out all his pent-up frustration on PAULA.

PAULA bristles at this insult to her husband's work.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 54A.

PAULA only stares at him in disgust. Thoroughly alarmed,

MILTON intervenes.

Throughout all this MARILYN herself looks lost. COLIN

watches her as she feels the crew's irritable collective

gaze. Flustered, she flutters her hands in a calming

gesture, then goes to the side of the set to lean on a bar

put there for her to rest on (her costume is too tight to

allow her to sit down). PAULA accompanies her. MARILYN

looks up at her in anguish.

PAULA looks at her adamantly.

MARILYN looks at her, desperately wanting to believe it.

MARILYN listens intently, a frown flitting across her face.

She goes back to her mark. The whole crew is on

tenterhooks.

Camera running, speed, mark it... Action! Take four.

79 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 79

OLIVIER is bewildered by her inability to appreciate her

own natural talent - as he sees it. He looks at her in

genuine anguish.

MARILYN flinches as though slapped. Tension ripples through

the set. COLIN watches in dismay.

He pauses for a second.

OLIVIER looks at him. MILLER shakes his head.

He pauses for a second, weighing every word carefully.

He looks up and nods slowly.

He leaves a long, uneasy pause.

MILLER plays with his whisky.

Forgotten in the shadows, COLIN listens attentively to

every word.

OLIVIER and VIVIEN stand in the shadows of the projector

beam. COLIN freezes in the doorway to the projection booth

holding a pile of film cans. VIVIEN is crying abjectly.

She laughs hysterically.

She looks at him venomously, a dangerous, unbalanced hatred

seething in her expression.

She storms out. After a beat, COLIN tentatively enters.

OLIVIER looks at COLIN in muted apology.

95 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. SOUND STAGE. DAY. 95

96 INT. PINEWOOD STUDIOS. OLIVIER'S DRESSING 96

The phone rings. OLIVIER picks with a sudden burst of

optimism.

He frowns and looks at COLIN in bewilderment.

Puzzled, COLIN takes the phone as OLIVIER stares at him.

CUT TO PARKSIDE, where, to Colin's astonishment MARILYN comes

on the line (Roger is not in shot).

CUT BACK TO PINEWOOD - MILTON recognises Marilyn's voice

instantly.

COLIN looks around helplessly.

CUT TO PARKSIDE. MARILYN smiles.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 70A.

She hangs up.

CUT TO PINEWOOD: COLIN replaces the phone in its cradle.

MILTON and OLIVIER stare at him.

97 INT. PARKSIDE HOUSE. DRAWING ROOM. DAY. 97

Colin doesn't know what to say. MARILYN gazes at him.

She looks at him, her eyes wide. COLIN feels himself

sinking into her gaze.

He shrugs in helpless agreement.

She indicates a chair and COLIN perches on it awkwardly.

He doesn't know how to reply and Marilyn misreads his

silence. Her eyes widen in dismay.

He nods uncertainly. She frowns.

COLIN hesitates then decides to throw caution to the wind.

He stops, breathless, knowing he has gone to far. She

stares at him, wide-eyed with surprise. Horribly self-

conscious he takes a too large swig of his brandy, reddens

and coughs. She laughs.

She smiles then sits opposite him.

She smiles wistfully. Her presence is overwhelming. The

silence stretches for a second, pregnant with strange

possibilities. Suddenly the phone rings, making him jump.

Automatically he picks it up.

OLIVIER offers COLIN a lewdly suggestive grin.

He barges out of the room, slamming the door behind him.

OLIVIER checks the effect of his Grand Duke in the mirror

and sighs abruptly.

He gazes at himself thoughtfully.

He leans back.

COLIN waits, uncertain why OLIVIER is confiding in him.

COLIN looks surprised. MILTON notices. COLIN stubs out his

cigarette and hurries to the passenger door.

MILTON sees a bulky blanket on the back seat.

COLIN looks at him, bemused. He gets in quickly. MILTON

frowns but shrugs and walks off with a wave.

Inside the car COLIN looks at ROGER.

In the same moment MARILYN herself erupts from under the

blanket in the back.

She laughs, looking wonderfully naughty.

He tries to scramble out but MARILYN hauls him back

gleefully.

He finds a portfolio on the table and opens it.

MARILYN smiles at a portrait of a young woman.

MORSHEAD laughs. He takes down another folder of drawings.

She looks at him, wide-eyed, playing up to her image as the

dizzy blonde. In fact she knows exactly who Da Vinci is, and

MORSHEAD is tactful enough to acknowledge it gracefully.

He closes the portfolio and takes MARILYN's arm briskly.

MARILYN looks at him, wide-eyed.

They stop as COLIN points up at a window.

MARILYN looks at him in shock.

She looks appalled.

She smiles at this, looking at him shrewdly.

She looks at him, sympathetic but pushing a little harder.

She smiles warmly, liking him a lot more for his openness.

We sense their relationship has moved quietly to a different

and deeper level.

But before either of them can say anything a SCHOOLBOY turns

the corner in his Eton uniform.

COLIN wades awkwardly to the shore, trying to conceal his

erection with his cupped hands. MARILYN giggles.

He grins. She reaches for her blouse and stands shivering

as she tries to dry herself. COLIN goes to take her in his

arms.

She snuggles into him gratefully, her teeth chattering. He

rubs her naked back briskly, her thin blouse the only

barrier between their bodies. Slowly his embrace becomes

more sensual, his hands slowing, stroking rather than

rubbing, his face buried in her hair, his arms pulling her

She looks at him, her expression knowing but sweet.

He tries to kiss her but she ducks her head away gently,

her expression wistful.

She suddenly looks much younger, her smile a poignant echo

of a lost childhood.

He steps back politely, allowing her to put on her blouse.

As she buttons it, she gazes at him, then impulsively leans

forward to kiss him chastely on the lips. The kiss is as

sweet and innocent as any 13 year old might wish.

The kiss lasts for a few seconds, their lips touching

gently, the river shimmering magically in the sunshine

behind them. When they finally break apart she rewards him

with a radiant smile.

She looks wistful for a second but quickly brightens.

MILTON looks at him for a long moment, masking his

hostility in barbed politeness.

COLIN reddens. MILTON shakes his head patronisingly.

COLIN stares at him, feeling hopelessly out of his depth.

He comes very close, his tone fierce but wounded.

He goes back to the house, pausing at the door, speaking

more in sorrow than anger.

He realises this doesn't sound reassuring.

She stares at him in puzzlement then breaks into a dazed

smile.

She reaches instinctively for the pill container on her

bedside table.

She frowns, clutching the pill bottle in one hand. He

reaches out and prises it gently from her grasp. As he puts

it back on the side he glances at the framed photograph.

Her expression softens as she looks at the picture.

Alongside her mother's photo is another framed picture,

this time of Abraham Lincoln. COLIN frowns.

She smiles, then looks at Colin wistfully.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 100.

He nods. She smiles sadly.

Her eyes fill with tears. She looks up at him anxiously.

He stares at her. She looks lovely but desperately

vulnerable.

She reaches for the pills and pours three or four into her

palm. COLIN gently takes her hand and takes two of them

away. She smiles, not objecting as he settles her back

gently on the pillow.

She smiles, teasing him. He smiles back. She takes his

hand, looking at him in appeal.

She stares at him, her face going blank with misery.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 101.

She looks at him, her eyes full of pain.

She looks so wretched, so completely baffled, that COLIN

responds with sudden passion.

She smiles and embraces him gratefully. She sighs.

He lies down next to her, taking her awkwardly in his arms.

She sighs sleepily.

She looks across at him, their faces inches apart.

COLIN stares back at her guiltily. She smiles.

She stares at him and tears gather in her eyes again. They

stare intently at each other, their mood fragile, touched

with both sensuality and a longing for something less

tangible. MARILYN leans forward and kisses him gently. The

embrace grows in passion and they kiss properly, hungrily.

He kisses her eyes and her face and she sighs happily.

He wants her more than he has wanted anything before.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 102.

And then he stops. The fantasy he has been pursuing for

weeks is within his grasp but he knows that whatever it

does for him it will only damage her further. He pulls away

from her gently. Her eyes flicker open lazily.

She wraps herself around him, curling up so their bodies

cradle each other like spoons in a cutlery draw. As she

buries her head in his neck he feels her breasts against

his back. She curls against him.

Her voice is blurred and drifting with sleep. With her body

warm against him COLIN's resolve nearly snaps but he is

clear eyed now and determined.

She mutters softly in reply.

He smiles and turns out the light.

MILTON looks at him grimly but finally surrenders the

field. Paula is more reluctant to give in. She sits on the

bed, stroking Marilyn's hand.

COLIN is surprised to see tears in her eyes.

Paula's love and sincerity are obvious. She means it. COLIN

watches her in silence. MARILYN squeezes her hand and PAULA

gets up with a heavy sigh, bitterly reluctant to leave.

Finally she drags herself out, leaving them alone.

As the door closes MARILYN curls herself up in the bed.

COLIN looks at her, his heart breaking at her anguish.

She gives him a wry look, teasing but thoughtful.

There is an edge to this. He gazes at her, shaken, but she

smiles and touches his face gently.

He gets on the bed, fully clothed, to fold her in his arms.

He is close to tears, suddenly looking very young. She

looks at him with a sad, sweet smile. He shakes his head

stubbornly, taking her hand in passionate appeal.

Her eyes widen in surprise. A flicker of nervous insecurity

dulls her expression.

She smiles tentatively, but he sees a terrible fear in her

eyes. He looks down, realising with a cruel stab of pain

that Olivier was right. There is no way back. She doesn't

want to be rescued.

He finally looks up, smiling despite the tears in his eyes.

She smiles, reassured. He drags himself off the bed and

goes to the door, pausing for a second as he looks back.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 111-

MARILYN turns to the assembled crew. A silence settles. She

smiles around, blinking in the lights. She looks for comfort

or support among the technicians but sees only blank faces or

sullen hostility. She smiles nervously.

She smiles up at their uneasy expressions, struggling to

understand herself and their expectations of her.

This oddly moving and open confession is received in silence.

No one quite knows how to react to her lacerating honesty.

Perhaps they think it is just another performance.

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 113B.

At first there is a buzz of excitement but then something odd

happens. One of the crew simply picks up his present without

looking at it and drops it in the large bin standing against

the wall.

There is a moment, then a WOMAN does the same with hers.

Suddenly there is a rush for the bin as almost everyone dumps

their present. The bin is soon overflowing.

MILTON stares at the scene, then simply shrugs and walks out.

ARTHUR JACOBS, utterly indifferent to the hostile

undercurrent, grins and waves cheerfully.

He goes out, grabbing a discarded bottle of booze from the

dustbin as he goes.

COLIN watches all this in shocked silence. He looks at the

label on his own small parcel, which reads simply "To Colin,

with thanks, Marilyn".

MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 116.

COLIN sits down next to the great man. They watch in

silence as another sequence is projected for them. The

sequence shows MARILYN improvising in the champagne and

caviar scene. She serves herself food and drink before

collapsing, drunk. The endless retakes and fluffs gone,

what remains is a gifted comic performance by a luminous

beauty.

He seems almost lost in awe. COLIN gazes at him in

surprise.

He smiles wryly.

He signals to the projection box and the film stops as the

lights come up.
