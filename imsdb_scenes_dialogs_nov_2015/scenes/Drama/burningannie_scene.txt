Abrupt CLOSE UP on MAX, a plain wall behind him.

He is 20, normal looking, not too nebbish, punkish, bookish,

or stylish. He is a high-strung guy, enjoying a rare moment

of un-self-consciousness.

There's an old joke. It comes from "The

Iliad," but I think it was popularized by

Oscar Wilde. It goes like this:

...A bear's taking a shit, like, out in the

woods one day. And he sees this rabbit,

also taking a shit. The rabbit, wait, I

mean, the bear, he's shitting up a storm,

cuz he's been eating Mexican. The

wiping's taking forever, and his shit

keeps sticking to his fur. Wait, what

happens next? Oh, right-- he asks the

rabbit if he ever has trouble wiping. The

rabbit says no, shit just slides right

off him. So the bear picks the rabbit up

and wipes his ass with him.

(pause, as if for applause)

Well, I never said it was a good joke.

And see, that makes it perfect, because

it's pretty much the story of my life.

We can now see that he's perched on a stool, wearing a REM t-

shirt and old jeans. He gesticulates vaguely as he talks.

Growing up, my parents were huge Woody

Allen fans. Still are. Personally, I hate

him. Same thing with the Beatles, such a

part of my background that I must have

been about 16 by the time I realized how

useless it was to rebel by ignoring the

Beatles or any other cultural artifact of

their generation. Even if I did spend my

childhood hearing my father go on and on

about how, like, Nirvana would never mean

anything because they're not the Beatles,

blah-blah. I don't know, this is all

starting to sound a little bit too

angsty, you know, and that's about the

last thing I'm going for here... Shit, I

really got off track there, didn't I?

As Max shakes his head, a hanging RADIO MIKE comes into view.

It has the call letters of a college radio station on it.

2.

High on the wall behind him, a glowing "ON AIR" light is

revealed. The perspective is skewed, the studio appears

cavernous and completely barren.

YOUNG MAX, about five, sits on the floor and watches BANANAS

with his FATHER, a large, relaxed man with a mustache who

reclines in a tacky 80's chair and smokes a cigar.

MAX (O.S.)

Anyway, like the Beatles thing and this

is the point of that whole long-winded

example I was force-fed Woody Allen from

a young age. I remember watching Bananas

when I was about five. Of course, I hated

it.

Young Max is laughing hysterically at the screen.

Max stands to the side, watching his younger self and his

father. The radio mike hangs in front of him.

This is my old house. We lived here, in a

dull suburb of New York, until I was ten,

when we moved to a different house in a

different dull suburb of New York.

On TV, a woman is bit in the breast by a snake and is chased

by a group of soldiers.

Daddy, why are they running after her?

Someday, you'll understand. Pay

attention, you'll learn something.

Young Max turns back to the screen, wide-eyed.

In pajamas, ADOLESCENT MAX, 16, watches a newer TV in an

identical family room. This time, ANNIE HALL is playing.

MAX (V.O.)

Oh yeah. This wasn't the first time I saw

Annie Hall, but it was the first time I

actually appreciated it. I was flipping

channels on a Saturday afternoon, and

there it was, and I was stunned to find I

loved it, more stunned to find that my

parents may have had a point all along.

3.

MAX (V.O.) (cont'd)

Although, they were definitely wrong

about Bananas.

CLOSE ON: Adolescent Max, totally engrossed in the film.

Adolescent Max walks alone to class. Other students rush by

in groups. He looks a little lost.

MAX (V.O.)

Oh God, high school. I hated this place.

I was a Junior when I gave up trying to

fit in. Fortunately, being a social

outcast is a lot easier when your school

is filled with idiots.

A pair of GOTH POSERS pass. Max keeps his distance. From the

other direction, a 6 FOOT TALL GIRL makes eyes at Max. He

walks into a water fountain, drops his books.

Adolescent Max gets hit in the face with a volleyball.

Everyone laughs at him, including the COACH.

Max stands to the side and winces.

There was something in Annie Hall I

identified with. Maybe it was the style

of humor, or the defeatist attitude, I

don't know. All I know is, I kept going

back. Different people are inspired by

different things, and my source of

inspiration became a 20-year-old movie

about a failed relationship.

The volleyball rolls over and he picks it up.

From behind Max, we see the station as it really is: small,

dark, cramped, and totally filled with crap. Max wears

headphones, sits before a large console and audio gear.

He now holds a volleyball.

So after high school I ended up here.

There was never really any choice, not

going to college was not an option. Of

course, I brought Annie with me. Good

thing, too.

4.

Watching it quickly became about the only

thing I could count on to go right.

Max is with five friends in the double, and they all have

lingering style-baggage from high school (eg. bad haircuts).

It was freshmen year when we started

watching Annie Hall as a tradition.

Jeez, this must have been the very first

time. What's Amy doing here? I'm pretty

sure Amy wasn't here.

AMY is attractive, bookish, and sitting on Max's bed.

CHARLES, a skinny guy in a large chair, tries to get her

attention by wiggling his eyebrows seductively.

Max puts the tape in the VCR, hits rewind, and moves to sit

on his bed. He pauses when he sees how close he'll come to

Amy. Finally, he climbs over her and awkwardly sits at the

far end.

Amy watches, rolls her eyes, and looks at BETH, who shakes

her head sadly. Beth is pretty in an earthy way, spunky and

sad at the same time. She looks sympathetically at Max, who

is trying not to act nervous (and failing).

The couple is SAM, who's short and charismatic, with a cool,

slightly punkish personal style; and JEN, same height, cute

and serious, conservative dress. They lie on the floor

together.

That's Sam and Jen. Sam was the alpha-

male of our group, which tends to consist

mostly of zeta-males. He had been going

out with Jen a couple weeks and we were

all waiting to see if she would change

him...

Sam slides a pillow under her.

Are you comfortable, honey?

I'm fine, Sam. I was worried about you.

Sure you don't want me to move over?

5.

Oh no, no, Jen, if you're happy, I'm

happy.

Max and Charles exchange a look-- there they go again. Max

makes a show of putting a pillow under a large Darth Vader

doll. Beth laughs, Amy is amused. Sam looks back and is

embarrassed. Jen rolls her eyes and gives Sam a look.

Are we gonna watch this movie or what?

Annie Hall's credits roll. Sam snaps on the lights.

Wow, what a good movie.

Oh, that was so sad! Relationships don't

have to be like that!

I can see why you like this so much. It

reminded me of you.

Uh, thanks, I guess. Does that mean you

liked it?

Max and Amy stand and face each other as the lights fade to

black around everyone else.

I didn't say I liked it, I said it

reminded me of you. It reminded me of

what I didn't like about you, the

cynicism, the neurotic insecurity, and oh

yeah, when you started calling me every

day. All the reasons we were never more

than friends.

Well, at least you're being honest.

Of course I'm being honest. This is a

fantasy extrapolated from a flashback.

How could I lie to you?

6.

I'm the only person I know who gets

insulted in his own fantasies.

Charles walks by, Amy takes his arm, and they disappear into

the surrounding darkness, which DISSOLVES TO:

and again Max is alone.

Anyway, Amy set the tone for the rest of

college...

The movie is Annie Hall. The theater is emptying. Suddenly,

ERICA bursts through the crowd. Erica is mad. Max follows

behind her, placating.

AND WHAT IS IT WITH JEWISH MEN AND THEIR

PENIS ISSUES?!

Max freezes in place. The entire crowd of students turns to

look at him. He manages a weak smile and turns back to Erica,

but she's gone, out the doors into the night.

Max turns back to the crowd and shrugs, but the crowd turns

away. Max suddenly sees someone: Beth, looking at him. He

blushes, self-conscious, and hurries away.

MAX (V.O.)

And even when it went right, it didn't.

Max and STACY stumble in, inebriated, laughing.

...And then I, then I, after I called the

pizza place, I called an ambulance, and

timed them.

Who won?

The pizza, of course. The paramedics took

35 minutes to arrive.

7.

I can't believe you! Did you get in

trouble?

The Station Manager said I couldn't go on

the air ever again.

So what'd you do?!

I gave him the pizza!

They collapse on the bed, laughing. Stacy rolls over and

kisses Max on the lips. His eyes go wide and he frantically

crawls backwards.

What? Don't you like me?

It would never work.

How would you know?

I know. I have a sixth sense.

You see dead people?

I see dead relationships.

Stacy sits up, frustrated, the mood ruined.

That was all true, but there was

something else, though. I mean, there I

was, drunk, in a girl's bedroom, and the

only thought running through my mind was...

Max speaks to someone O.S.

..."What about Beth?"

Max is talking to Beth. It's a beautiful Spring day.

8.

I mean, I know we're just friends, but

you really mean a lot to me and we've

been spending a lot of time together

lately, and maybe... I guess what I'm

saying is, maybe we could try going out

on a date or something?

Max...

I mean, it wouldn't have to be, uh...

Sure.

We wouldn't have to... What?

I'd love to. How's tomorrow night?

Um, yeah, it would have to be after, or

maybe... Yeah, tomorrow, uh, tomorrow

night's fine.

Great. I know the perfect thing.

She splits, leaving Max befuddled at his change of fortune.

Max and Beth are walking through the night in overcoats.

Never?

Not until Sam and Jen.

A perfect record. Wow.

I don't get what the fuss is. I knew you

and that Chris guy wouldn't last a week

as soon as I saw you together.

But you can tell with everybody? I don't

know if that's sad or incredible.

9.

Or incredibly sad. I'm amazed I'm the

only one who can tell. Take any couple.

If it's not incompatible lifestyles, it's

conflicting priorities. If it's not that,

it's usually clashing levels of self-

esteem. It's always something.

Living with you would be a nightmare. I'd

be afraid to bring any boyfriends home.

Oh, uh, sorry.

Well, just because I see it, doesn't mean

I talk about it. I don't say a word to my

suitemates.

You guys never talk about anything

important anyway.

Oh, come on, we have philosophical

discussions all the time.

Like whether Voltron could kill the

Transformers?

To name one hot-button issue, yes. You

want us to talk about girls? Sam is

nearly married to Jen, Charles doesn't

want his relationships to last, Tommy's

girlfriends are located in online

chatrooms across the country, and Scott,

well... you know.

For such "close" friends, it just seems

weird, that's all. I must admit, I'm a

lot closer to you than any of them.

What are doing here?

10.

Max and Beth remove their coats, revealing formal wear. OTHER

STUDENTS give them looks. An older female LIBRARIAN

approaches.

Ah, you must have the reservation for

booth seven.

Yes, that's us.

What?

Right this way, then.

"Reservation"?

You'd be surprised how many of you

lovebirds we get in here.

She winks and leads them to the elevator. Beth smiles shyly

and looks at Max, but he is merely embarrassed. Her smile

fades.

Max and Beth are watching the opening credits of Annie Hall

on a tiny TV in a cubicle. They are surrounded by other

students in cubicles.

Isn't this great?

Well, this isn't exactly what I had in

mind.

What do you mean?

For starters, I have a serious problem

with spending any time in the library

when I don't have to. I'm here once or

twice a year as it is. Plus...

(holds up headphones)

What's the point of seeing this together

if we're wearing headphones?

11.

Why not be with a life-sized cardboard

cut-out? That way you can be with someone

famous, even a dead person. Wouldn't you

rather be with Elvis?

Oh, shhh...!

Or Batman?

Can't you just enjoy the moment?

I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

I'm a little nervous. It's like, our

first date and everything.

Oh. Yeah.

Max and Beth leave the library. Their dispositions have

switched: Max is perky while Beth is subdued.

I can't believe how many great lines

there are. Even the little throwaways,

like when she parks and he's like,

"That's okay, we can walk to the curb

from here."

Yeah. I loved it, I'm serious. I'm so

glad we did this.

Yeah, me too.

But man, relationships are a lot of work,

aren't they?

Uh, sure, sometimes...

Beth stops him, and they sit on a bench. The night is cold.

They sit close and lean in, speaking in hushed tones.

12.

If I'm going to jump into anything with

you, Max, I need some sign that you're

serious about it. About me.

What? You want me to get a tattoo or

something?

Look, you've gotta admit, you're the most

pessimistic person in the world.

Obviously you've never met my mother.

Can you be serious for a second?

I guess you really haven't met my mother...

Look, Max, this isn't going to work.

Wait a second.

Okay. No more jokes. Now. Tell me how you

feel.

About what?

About me.

I, I...

Why are you doing this? Since when have

you gotten "serious" about relationships?

Your last boyfriend dumped you after four

days.

Well, that was intimate. Thanks, Max.

13.

No wait, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, hold on.

Max, I don't think this is such a good

idea. I mean, it would be really foolish

to jeopardize our friendship.

No, it wouldn't!

We shouldn't have rushed into this. I'm

sure you know it wouldn't have worked

out.

I don't know that.

Please tell me we haven't hurt our

friendship. You don't even know how much

you mean to me.

I'm starting to get the idea.

He's dazed, slightly ill. Beth touches his arm gently and

walks away. Max turns to us. A radio mike swings into view.

Things weren't the same after. We quickly

became the kind of friends who say Hi on

the paths but don't stop walking. Then,

she moved across campus and changed

majors, and basically, except for the

random phone call, I haven't seen her in

ages.

MAX, thoughtful. PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

Max, speaking in the empty station, suddenly gets intense.

All these dates had one thing in common!

And it took Charles, of all people, to

point it out to me.

14.

It's late January and the campus is showing signs of a

temperamental winter.

MAX (V.O.)

This morning, we were skipping class.

Max and Charles walk across the quad towards us. At first,

they are only specks in the distance.

Max, you're insane.

It's ridiculous that even at a liberal

school like this, I have to put up with

anti-Semitism.

So you got a C minus! Don't you think

you're getting carried away?

He couldn't just fail me, think about it.

The paper was about my grandparents'

experience in the Holocaust.

Your paranoia has always been out of

control, but this is absurd.

You don't understand, you're not Jewish.

Neither are you!

But the professor probably thinks I am.

And wasn't that the paper that you handed

in two weeks late?

You know what else? I think he might be

German.

Professor Wang? Will you stop it...

We can now see that Charles has a fedora cocked back on his

head, and is wearing incongruous "Vegas" clothes.

15.

They walk past and into the University Center.

It's a low-traffic time of day.

So what do you want to do tonight?

I'm not sure. It is the beginning of the

semester, it's time for our Annie Hall

night.

Have you ever noticed that the more Annie

Hall you watch, the less successful you

are romantically? I think we'd do much

better if we watched, say, Ocean's 11.

What are you talking about? If you're

sick of Annie Hall, that's one thing, but

don't blame our sad little lives on it.

Charles picks out breath mints.

No, I'm telling you, I was thinking about

this over break. Ever since we started

watching it, what has your love life been

like? And mine? Every semester, we watch

this movie, and then spend the semester

alone.

Alone? Last semester you hooked up with

like a dozen women.

You know actresses don't count.

I'm looking for a meaningful,

sophisticated relationship. Like Frank

and Ava. No more shallow dames for this

cat.

Where did you get this grudge against my

favorite film?

16.

I'm just kidding around, Max. We'll watch

it tomorrow. Tonight, there's a party.

And anyway, your theory fails to account

for our collective dorkiness and bad

haircuts. Plus, look at Sam.

Sam hasn't seen Annie Hall since freshman

year, and he's in his third year with

Jen.

So look at what not watching can do to

you.

Ouch. Why are you still on this? I said I

was kidding.

What a nightmare. I dunno why I can't

stop thinking about these things. I guess

I've been a little restless lately, since

getting back from winter break.

Everything's been kind of weird lately.

He grabs a CD from a rack.

Hope you enjoyed this week's Reggae

Revelry Hour. This is Max filling in for

Rasta Ronnie, taking you out with a

little Bad Religion.

He puts in the CD, hits "Shuffle/Repeat," and leaves. The

caller request lines blink furiously.

TITLE CARD: white on black: "SUNDAY"

Max's dormitory suite: four bedrooms off a common room, which

has three battered couches, a coffee table, and in a corner,

several small fridges and two televisions in a pile.

Christmas lights are still up. A neon `Guinness' sign dwarfs

it all.

17.

Max, you're coming and that's the end of

it. When's the last time you went to a

party?

Who cares? It's unnatural. If I went into

a stranger's house and ate their food

under any other circumstance, I'd be

arrested.

I'm not taking no. With Sam on board,

it's gonna be like old times.

Yeah, I haven't been out with you guys in

ages.

You're going out?

Aw, honey, just for a little while.

You know I have to work until midnight.

It's not my fault the supervisor won't

let me out of it.

She has a point, guys. I should catch up

on my chemistry reading anyway.

18.

She sits off to the side, sneaking looks at Scott. He's

watching a golf-related infomercial.

So Scott... How come you're not going out

with Charles and Max?

Can't go. Graphic design work.

Oh really? I have work, too, but it's

okay, I got a lot done today. What do you

have to do?

Graphic design work.

TOMMY enters. He's preppier than anyone else, conservative

clothes capped off by a goofy smile and thick glasses.

What's up, all?

Tommy, at last. Save me from this lounge

lizard.

Yeah, what are you doing tonight?

Physics lab. Fortunately, the semester's

just begun, so before the work piles up,

I can party. That's why the beginning of

the semester rules.

Great, so come party with me.

I can't, I have physics work.

He disappears into his room. Charles takes Max's hat from a

hook, jams it on his head, and shoves him towards the door.

A typically lame college party, still early in the night. The

furniture is "student budget modern" type. A jazz record

plays quietly, while pretentiously-dressed PARTY-GOERS sip

wine and eat cheese and crackers.

Max and Charles survey the room, drinks in hand.

19.

Cheers to a new semester, full of

potential that will surely go to waste.

This is it, I'm telling you. This is the

semester I pass all my classes and meet

the dame of my dreams.

Good luck, and may she have a sister.

More importantly, may she grant us our

occasional freedom.

Ah, forget about Sam. I don't like it any

more than you.

He's become a total non-entity. Freshman

year, we were like Frank and Deano. Now

it's like Frank and freakin' Peter

Lawford.

Hey, he was one of my best friends. Now

we share a room and he's like a stranger.

Hottie at 3 o'clock. Keep an eye on her

for me so it doesn't look like I'm

interested.

Yeah, right, then if you fail to sodomize

her, you'll blame me. Me, or Annie Hall.

Look, all I said was, it would explain

our lives.

The problem is, every crazy theory

explains something. I took a class last

semester with a professor who claimed

that the planet is being destroyed by

white, male, meat-eating capitalists.

So? Everybody knows that.

20.

But she had a theory that explained how:

apparently racism, sexism, socialism,

environmentalism, and vegetarianism are

all inherently linked. I brought a Big

Mac to the first class, and I thought I

was going to be the victim of a vegan-

socialist uprising.

Hey! I made it!

I can't believe it.

Wow, the laws of nature have stopped

working. Maybe I should try to meet some

chicks after all.

How'd you get away?

I told her I was going to the lab. She

doesn't mind if I'm working while she is.

How's the party?

Sucks. Who are they trying to be, with

this wine and cheese? What kind of party

doesn't even have beer?

I can get into this. It's better than

those frat parties. Check out the fox in

the beret.

Man, it's so good to be out. Between Jen,

homework, and labs, I hardly have time

for anything.

You could always change your major. You'd

have a lot more free time.

I feel the same way about science that I

do about Jen. It's a lot of work, but

it's worth it.

21.

I have doubts about both, actually. But

still, what could be dumber than changing

your major for a girl?

Changing your girl for a major.

Would you do it?

It wouldn't be an issue.

Of course not, when has studying ever

interfered with what's important, like

video hockey or your radio show that

nobody listens to.

I meant, I'd have to have a girl first.

And lay off the radio show. There's a

reason I took the 3am slot.

And every time I see you doing homework,

you're taking a break. You're the best

I've ever seen when it comes to

procrastinating.

I should be, procrastination is one of my

favorite hobbies. Isn't it funny that my

two favorite hobbies rhyme?

Oh, shit, Sara's here.

Ta-daaa! Hey guys, what's going on?

We were just talking about the mediocre

resonations of sub-hybrid fields.

I can't believe you think they're

mediocre. Those guys rock.

22.

(doesn't get it, doesn't care)

Oh. Well, I just wanted to stop by and

say "hey" to my favorite guys. So hey!

How was everyone's break?

Good.

It could have been better but it could

have been worse. For me, that's good.

Mine was great! I partied with my best

friend Melanie, who I haven't seen in

ages. Aren't these parties just the best?

So much better than the theater group

parties.

I dunno, it's a bunch of 21-year-olds who

want the 18-year-olds to know how mature

they are.

Hey, Charles, you going to the fraternity

party after this?

Ugh, no.

You gonna be back at your suite then?

Maybe I'll stop by.

Uh, yeah, we should be back in, uh, many

many hours.

Okay then, I'll catch up with you guys

later.

I missed you.

23.

Shit, I was hoping to avoid her for at

least a few more days.

What do you have against her? She seems

nice.

First, she makes my skin crawl. Second,

if word gets out, it'll ruin my

reputation in the freshman dorms.

Never hook up with people in your cast.

I am a world-class knucklehead.

I'm sorry to interrupt, I thought I heard

one of you say "Max."

One of us is Max.

Oh, great, just as I hoped. I just wanted

to say, I heard your radio show last week

and I thought it was great. Thoughtful

and poignant and funny, too. You know,

you look just like I imagined, too.

Thanks.

I'm Max.

Huh?

I'm Max.

Oh my God, you heard my show?

You're Max? Then who are you?

24.

Charles. I'm an actor.

You okay? You look like you're in pain.

You don't get it, I can't do my show if I

even suspect someone is listening. Now I

have to change time slots. Again.

I'm sorry, I didn't realize I wasn't

supposed to listen.

No, it's no good, the whole episode is

ruined. This is a disaster.

I work in theater a lot.

Alright, listen. I was kidding. Your show

actually kind of sucked.

What?!

Just kidding! It was awesome.

I also direct.

Uh, when did you tune in? I need to know

which episode you ruined.

At one point you dialed a phone sex line.

It was hilarious. It's not every day

someone calls 1-900-4RIMJOBS to discuss

politics.

And she hung up. "This isn't the place

for that kind of talk..."

25.

Yeah, it's like, for four dollars a

minute, you should talk about whatever

you want. You know the country's in

trouble when a phone sex operator thinks

talking politics is beneath her.

Perhaps she'd been screwed by

politicians. Phone sex is just pretend

but politics... I know my ass is still

sore.

Listen, I'm being flagged down by my over-

protective friends. It was nice meeting

you, though.

Wait, wait. How did you know about my

show?

Someone mentioned you.

Anybody I know? Oh, duh, I guess it would

have to be someone I know.

It was from a good source. I was told I'd

like you, but to really know you, I

should hear your show.

What, really?

It was Beth.

26.

Check it. Jen traded shifts and got out

of work, so she went to the lab to

surprise Sam. He wasn't there, and

then Tommy gave away that he was here.

Busted.

And how. Let's bail before the beheadings

begin. Plus, The Rat Pack's on HBO later.

They put on their coats.

How can you stand that show?

I told you, it's research. It's why I got

three phone numbers, Max, while you were

talking to that cutie.

"Cutie"?

That's right. You get her name?

We just met. I was working up to it.

Man, you're worse at picking up chicks

than me. We are one sad couple of bozos.

Max looks at him like he's insane.

Alone, he kicks snow off his boots as he sheds his winter

layers. He taps the answering machine.

Uh, hi, Max. Guess who? It's Beth. Been a

while, huh? Since that lunch last August

that somehow never happened. Anyway, uh,

just checking in, I guess. Hope your

break was okay. Uh, and----

27.

BEEEEEEEP. The machine cuts her off. Max sighs, picks up the

phone, dials.

Hello? Beth?... Sorry... Hello...? Hey, how's

it going?... Yeah, in person... Too long... So

anyway, I just wanted to say hi, and

also, stop telling people to listen to my

show... Of course I'm serious... Stop

laughing... Of course I haven't changed...

TITLE CARD: white on black: "MONDAY"

Sara sleeps on a couch. Charles, wearing only boxers, hung

over and mostly asleep, passes through the living room. He

stubs his toe and crashes into the wall.

Ow! Shit! Ow!

He continues into the bathroom. Sara wakes up and looks

around groggily. A FLUSH. Charles walks out of the bathroom

and blinks at Sara with surprise.

Jeeezzus! Shit, sorry you um...

It's all right, this isn't the first time

this has happened. At least this time I'm

not the naked one.

It's just that, I mean, I'm just

surprised to see you here.

Hmm, yeah, I must have shown up after you

came back, or something. I was planning

to go home, but I guess I fell asleep.

She waits for something from Charles. He doesn't respond. She

reluctantly gets to her feet.

Anyway, I, uh, I've got a bunch of stuff

to do. I'll see you later.

Bye.

28.

You all right?

She's around all the time! I chose to

live with my hombres, not her. She's got

to realize that we're not right for each

other and get on with her life.

No, I mean, I thought I heard you fall or

something.

Oh, what? I just stubbed my toe.

That sucks. Bad way to start the day.

The toe's the least of it.

This is funny, in a way. Yesterday you

were complaining about not having any

girls. Now you're complaining because you

have one.

I know. It's a shame. And I was attracted

to her once, too. What happened?

Want me to tell you?

No! I think I've heard enough from the

Nostradamus of failed relationships to

last a lifetime.

Speaking of failed relationships, I was

thinking about your Annie Hall theory.

Specifically, I was thinking that you're

insane.

I said I was joking, so why do you keep

bringing it up?

29.

It's like you insulted my religion. Like,

"Hey, Cardinal, I think Jesus might be

why you're not getting laid..."

Your attitude's too dour. You've gotta be

more fun.

It's not my fault Annie Hall's honest

about the futility of romance.

You're just a wuss. The very thought of

not seeing that movie scares you. You're

like a junkie, you need movie methadone.

Like, from now on you can only see

Manhattan.

Forget it, I hate Manhattan.

You think addicts like Methadone?

My Uncle Harry didn't seem to mind.

So what are we doing for lunch?

Scott enters.

You mean breakfast.

Actually, I'm supposed to eat with Beth.

He doesn't look excited at the prospect, but Charles does.

Beth? Wow. She hasn't been around in

ages. Say hi for me.

Max walks with Beth down the city street. She carries an

umbrella and scans the skies.

Wasn't it supposed to rain?

30.

I dunno.

Max, it's been ten minutes and we're

still discussing the weather.

So? Think of all the people who've died

in hurricanes. I bet they think it's a

worthy issue.

I just feel like there are other things

we could be talking about. You're the one

person I could rely on to say something

original.

Okay, okay.

So, what classes are you taking?

This was a mistake, wasn't it?

What? No.

They stop in front of Frannie's, a small greasy spoon.

Look, let's just call it a day. I was

excited to hear from you, but I can't

take you like this.

A COUPLE exit, the guy holds the door for them. They

hesitate. Suddenly, from inside:

CHARLES (O.S.)

Max! Beth! Come sit with us!

No, I'm sorry. Don't worry about it. To

be honest, it's nice being with someone

besides my suitemates for a change.

They look in and see...

...Charles, Scott, Amanda, Sam and Jen, seated around a huge

table. They are waving them in. Beth enters, Max reluctantly

follows.

31.

Oh my, God, Beth! It's great to see you!

It's been so long!

How did we ever fall out of touch? We

shouldn't let that happen again.

I know! I even miss this place. I live on

the wrong side of campus now. You guys

still come here? It's so dark and the

menu is tiny.

It never changes, that's why.

What are you gonna get?

Maybe an omelet.

Do you have to get eggs? I'm allergic.

So don't get the eggs.

It's just that, it's the smell. It's the

smell that bothers me.

Are you serious? How can you be allergic

to the smell of my eggs?

Don't worry about it, Jen. He's just

incredibly picky about food.

Even other people's.

Look, if you're going to have eggs, let

me at least switch seats with Sam, so

I'll be farther away from it.

32.

Max, what's up with you today? Join a

support group.

If it really bothers you, why don't you

and Beth switch?

This would put Beth next to Charles. She looks at him and he

smiles. Unable to help herself, she smiles back.

What about people at other tables? Should

we ask the management to stop serving egg-

products to people upwind of you?

Why can't you just get along with

everyone for once?

Alright, alright, you win, we'll switch.

Come on, Beth, get up.

What makes you so sure I'm gonna switch?

I don't think I'm gonna move.

Don't give in, Beth. I've got your back.

You owe me. Remember when you threw that

egg at me in the dining hall?

Okay, I'll get up. But I'm ordering an

omelet.

She sits down next to Charles and they smile at each other.

Max walks down the street toward an ATM, where a long line of

college students has formed. Next to the ATM is an arthouse

theater. The marquee reads "Thru Valentine's Day: ANNIE HALL

and CASABLANCA."

He joins the ATM line. A moment later, Julie walks by. She

notices him and stops.

Hi. Look at this line.

33.

Oh, hey. Yeah, I hate coming here this

time of day, but I need money. You know,

gambling debts and all.

Aren't ATMs great? They save so much

time. Think about what life must have

been like before them.

I can't support an acronym without

knowing what it stands for. I once joined

NAMBLA because I thought it was an animal

rights group.

So, are you a junior, too?

I'm listed as a sophomore, but I've taken

some time off.

What're you majoring in?

Why is that always the first question?

It was my second question.

And how would you answer it?

I'd be honest. Oh, wait. Media Studies.

This week, I'm majoring in Media Studies.

I used to be a double-major, Renaissance

Footwear and Neurosurgery, but, ya know,

it was just too hard to get course credit

for watching movies.

I bet. Me, I'm in Soc., but I'm leaning

toward Business, or Psych. Or Art

History.

Why don't you just be undeclared?

34.

Not my style.

Max's turn-- but he spots ANNIE HALL on the marquee.

Impulsively, he turns Julie to face him, so that her back is

to it. In doing so, he steps away from the ATM.

Are you okay? I thought you needed money.

Uh, I forgot, my bookie takes checks now.

Seriously, is everything okay?

Actually, yes. But I need something from

you.

What?

Your name.

It's Julie, no nickname. Don't even think

of calling me "Jewel."

Okay, Julie with no nickname, I, um, I'll

see you around?

Probably.

She leaves. Max goes back to the end of the line.

Lounging are Max and Charles, Sam and Tommy, and Scott and

Amanda.

Charles pulls a bottle of vodka from a newsbox.

Come on, which of you cats is in?

It's only Monday.

35.

Shit, it's only Monday? Now I really need

a drink.

I'm in.

How was your day?

My day sucked. I spent six hours in the

lab and four hours in class. And tonight,

I have to study for two tests.

Ouch.

It better be worth it when I get into

grad school.

Scott, how's the design project coming?

Slowly. There are a couple problems.

Huh.

Listen, I have an extra ticket to this

concert tomorrow night.

The Ani DiFranco show? Awesome!

That's been sold out for weeks!

36.

It's not Ani DiFranco, it's better-- two,

front row seats at the Campus Choir

charity show.

Oh.

So do ya wanna go?

I dunno. Why don't you call me tomorrow

during the day.

Okay, great.

It's getting late. See you guys later.

SAM - MAX - CHARLES

Bye.

See you tomorrow.

Wow, that went pretty good.

Using Ani DiFranco to get laid. I've

gotta try that.

She'll never give up on Scott.

It's not like I expect anything, I just

like to spend time with her.

Scott, do you mind if I take Amanda to a

concert tomorrow night?

Why would I?

37.

I didn't think so, but not asking would

be wrong.

No, it wouldn't.

But...

It's not even a date.

It's nothing serious, but it is a date.

But they're going as friends.

They are friends.

She probably won't even go.

Whenever you're done, someone please give

me an update on my sex life.

How does "sex life" enter, if she might

not be going, and if she does, it's just

as friends?

Wait, can you be on a date with someone

you're not dating?

Yes. No.

I didn't think it was such a big deal!

I just wanted to make sure it didn't

bother you.

38.

This conversation is starting to bother

me.

TITLE CARD: white on black: "TUESDAY"

Max shakes a tumbler as Amanda keeps time.

Tired yet?

This is ridiculous. What other art form

involves industrial toxins and complex

chemical reactions? Nobody ever got

cancer from dancing.

You're so paranoid.

I'm serious. Chemicals make me very

nervous. Isn't this how the Unabomber got

started?

He continues shaking.

Max, do I bother Scott when I'm around?

Uh, boy, this fixer smells delicious...

`Cuz, sometimes it seems like I do. I

know he's not, like, interested, but

then, sometimes it seems like he is. I

just don't want it to be awkward. Please,

tell me the truth.

I, uh, I mean, the truth is, it's not a

topic. It doesn't bother him, or us. Or I

mean, he doesn't talk about it.

So he never talks about me?

Yes, I mean, no, not with us, anyway.

39.

I knew it.

Listen. All I'm trying to say is, you're

not a topic that comes up very often.

So with all the time we spend together,

none of you have any opinion of me?!

Well, that's not... what I meant. Oy.

It's time! To unroll the film.

Listen, Amanda. Scott likes you as much

as we all do, so it doesn't leave much

room for discussion. We mostly only talk

about what we hate.

I know. It's just sometimes, I wish...

Yeah, I know.

AMANDA (O.S.)

Max? Are you coming?

Shit!

40.

AMANDA (O.S.)

Why does it always take you so long in

there?

Max enters to find Sam playing video hockey.

Hey, remember the scene in Swingers when

they play this? That was awesome. I love

movie scenes I can relate to.

He sits down next to him.

Yeah. Wasn't there also a video hockey

scene in Mallrats?

No, you're thinking of Chasing Amy.

Which one had all the comic book stuff?

They both did.

What about the Star Wars stuff?

Mallrats, Clerks, and Dogma.

What about the last one?

Doesn't count, it was just an ad for all

his other films.

You gotta admit, it's fucking cheap for a

movie to refer to other movies.

Why? We do it real life. We're doing it

right now. What you're saying is, if this

was a movie, it wouldn't be any good.

Yeah. Our lives would make an awful

movie.

41.

But if our lives were a movie, you'd

never be able to say that. You'd be

giving the critics the perfect quote to

pan it with.

So fucking what? It's a shitty movie!

Sam drops his controller and gets up.

Are you okay?

How come you only play this one video

game?

Video hockey is my game. Like a swan, I

mate for life.

More like the loon.

Max looks him over.

Holy shit, you and Jen broke up.

Yeah. Your prediction finally came true.

Come on, let's hit the bar. I need a

drink.

A crummy collegiate dive. Sam and Max drink coffees.

Okay, so what happened?

We were just hanging out, and she told me

she loves me. Completely out of the blue.

She says things like that sometimes,

things like "I love that you're my

boyfriend," ya know? But usually when

we're in bed or something. But this time

it was different, all we were doing was

watching TV.

Porn?

42.

Almost. It was "our" show, the one we

like to get romantic to...

Sam and Jen watch "The X-Files." Max stands, observing. Jen

can't see him.

I was just tired of trying to tell her

what she wanted to hear all the time, so

I tried to be honest.

We've been together a long time and I

really care about you, but I don't know

if I love you. This is tough to say, but

I think something might be missing from

our relationship.

Something's missing?

Well, not completely... I don't know if I

can explain it. See...

There are three things I look for in a

girl: heart, body, and mind. And well,

you've got the body.

Max is stunned and laughs. Jen is stunned, too, and runs out.

Jesus. You think you know someone pretty

well and then they do something like

this.

When she comes back, she slaps me in the

face and makes me leave. Then she calls,

crying, and asks me to come over. When I

go back, she kicks me out and says she

never wants to see me again.

Fifty bucks says there's a message on the

machine when we get back.

Max sits, and the background DISSOLVES back TO:

43.

Is it really so bad? I couldn't lie to

her.

Don't you know that no matter how often

girls tell you they want honesty, they

never really mean it? Nobody does!

Look, I fucked up, alright? I didn't know

what to say.

It's too bad it ended like this. I'm

really sorry.

Me too. It'll be hard to get used to, but

at least we ended it early.

Sam throws some money on the table and they get up.

Hey, you know what I'm in the mood for?

Annie Hall.

Jesus, that film...-- Have you heard

Charles' theory?

Come on, Max, I can only deal with one

mid-life crisis at a time.

I can't believe you said that to her.

That's so cool.

You think?

No.

Gee, at least I can hang out with my

friends again.

44.

"New wave dance party" in The Pub, the small, grungy club on

campus. A DJ plays something obscure from the 80s. Some

people dance, while the rest, including Max, Charles, and

Scott, sit at tables by the coffee bar in the back.

I was talking to Amanda the other day.

Was that Thursday? Because there was that

half hour when she didn't call or visit.

Scott, why don't you go for her? You seem

to get along well.

She follows me around now. If we slept

together, I'd never get rid of her.

You're exaggerating.

Look at Sam and Jen.

Ouch.

Bad example: it could never get that bad.

Ouch.

Then look at Charles and Sara.

Okay, ouch for real this time.

Max looks O.S. and goes pale.

Shit, she's here.

Julie walks through the crowd in their direction, but stops

at another table, talking to friends. Max exhales slowly.

That dame from History class?

45.

No. She's, she's just a girl. I shouldn't

have mentioned it.

But you did mention it.

Ohhh, that's the one from the party.

Yeah.

Get her name yet?

Yeah, it's "Julie"... Julie. She's cute,

and she seems interesting, but I'm sure

she has all kinds of horrible flaws I

don't know about.

Uh-oh. This is bad.

What do you mean?

You're thinking about her. You're already

making yourself nervous and you barely

know her. You do this every time!

I wonder if maybe I should go say hi.

See, this is what I'm talking about.

If you don't go hit on her, I will.

Do you know the guys she's talking to?

Yeah. The guy in the jacket is annoying.

Shit, shit, shit, she's looking this way.

Fuck. What should I...?

46.

You have no choice. If you back away now,

she'll never get to see the rest of your

annoying personality traits.

You're right. I can't deprive her of

that.

Julie is with ANDY and MARK. Andy is your basic hippie,

resplendent in a ridiculous green shag jacket. Mark has a cap

and is wearing a J Crew long-sleeve shirt over a Dave

Matthews Band t-shirt.

Max approaches.

Max! What's going on?

Hey.

Do you guys know Max? This is Mark...

Wassup.

...And Andy.

Hey Max, how's it hanging, bud?

Fine. I, uh, really like your jacket. Is

that real carpet?

Yeah, man. I couldn't believe my luck

when I saw it. This shade of shag is,

like, so rare. I was like, woah...

Hey, are we gonna burn this or what?

Yeah, man. Hey, you guys are like all

invited, if you can handle some kind bud...

"Maui wowey," you know?

47.

Aloha?

Mark, Julie, and Max sit around a wooden table in a small

apartment's kitchen. Andy puts on a CD.

Hey man, you like Zappa?

Dweezil or Moon Unit?

Frank.

(then gets it, laughs)

Man, that isn't even funny. You should

check out "Apostrophe" some time.

"Apostrophe"?

It's an album.

I thought he was correcting my grammar.

Can I get anyone beers? Julie?

Sure.

You know it.

Okay.

Mark distributes beers to everyone but Max.

Sorry, Max, we don't have enough.

Uh, yeah, sure.

You want mine?

48.

No thanks. I'm kinda picky about beer.

I'm more into stuff like Guinness, Bass,

Killians.

That's so... British.

It's a coincidence, I swear.

I thought Guinness was going to be cool,

but it sucks. Made me nauseous.

Dude, puking blows. That's why I smoke

weed. You get high right away and no

hangover!

Yeah, I don't know. Giving me pot is like

letting Richard Simmons smoke crack. I'm

paranoid enough as it is.

Yeah, well, some people just can't handle

their bud.

Andy, what are you looking for?

Wow. I bet you could use that for yard

work.

Julie, you don't smoke either, right?

Really?

49.

50.

Originally he wanted to change it to

something else.

Hey Julie, check out my new tattoo.

Gee, Mark, that's really cool.

I know it's not what you suggested, but I

needed something more... masculine.

You think you're pretty funny, huh?

C'mon, I thought hippies were mellow.

You just call me a hippie?

Sorry, Popeye, I guess I was thrown by

the Dave Matthews merchandise.

I'm in a frat, geek.

Well shouldn't you be back there date-

raping someone?

Julie, where did you find this creep?

Mark, lay off. Go take a hit off the

Hoover and mellow out.

(turning to Max)

Max, I'm sorry.

Hey, it's okay. I'm cool.

51.

He takes a beer from the table, fumbles, and drops it.

Nah, it's time. It's getting late anyway.

She puts out her cigarette and grabs her coat.

Max and Julie approach Shelly Hall.

So you live here, huh? Does it bother you

to be in an all-female dorm?

No, well, a little, sure. But there are

always men around. During fire drills,

more guys come out than girls. Never the

same ones either. They come and go.

I bet they do.

Julie catches herself and laughs. Max shares a smile with her

in the doorway.

I had a good time tonight, but next time,

let's have some real fun.

Oh, fine, uh, next time I'll bring Jack

Nicholson and a case of Schnapps.

Good night, Max.

Julie enters the dorm. Max watches her through the glass.

TITLE CARD: white on black: "WEDNESDAY"

MATCH DISSOLVE TO:

CLOSE UP of a schedule's column heading: "Wednesday"

PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

52.

Max reads the schedule on the door. His watch says 11am; he

finds Wednesday 11am: "Julio's Death Metal Jamboree." He

peeks behind the door-- the station is empty.

He starts to slip inside when...

BETH (O.S.)

Max!

He whirls, closing the door guiltily. Beth comes down the

hall, laden with books.

Uh, hi...

It was great running into your friends,

but... you know... I feel bad about what I

said. Do you want to get together later?

I don't know, I'm sure I have something

to do that I've forgotten.

Come on, it's bad enough we fell out of

touch, but we can't even have lunch?

We had breakfast.

Every time we try to do anything, you

have an excuse, or forget to show up, or

you cancel.

You cancel on me, too.

I'm sorry. Things have been a little, you

know, awkward.

Look, the whole thing was my fault. Let's

drop it, okay?

Beth throws up her hands, turns away.

Okay, lunch, you win.

53.

Now you're only going because I gave you

a hard time.

Guilt is a powerful force. Just be glad

it's on our side for once.

Okay, how is the Kidney Bean at noon?

Awful, just like every other time of day.

Their food is just birdseed prepared

fancy.

The Fabulous Diner, then. Friday at noon?

Fine.

She leaves. Max finds his old slot on the schedule and

crosses it out. Then he slips into the station.

A shitbox pulls up. Sam drives, Max rides shotgun. Scott and

Amanda are in back.

And then I got to thinking, you know, I

really think I like vanilla.

Sam turns off the car.

I'll be right back.

Me too.

They get out and go into the store.

They enter an aisle and Sam grabs various items as he talks.

Jen called yesterday, while we were at

the bar.

You call her back?

54.

Yeah. I went over there to talk again

today. She's taking it hard.

Imagine that.

We're having dinner tonight. Wanna come?

Don't put me in the middle of this. Are

you definitely broken up? Because it

seems a little up in the air.

Yeah, we're definitely broken up. I guess

sometimes it seems like we're sliding

back into our old patterns.

It's not what you think. I need a

petroleum jelly for the polymers class

I'm TA-ing.

Don't even think of it.

What-the-heck.

I need a basket. Hold this.

Hello... Big night?

Um, it's for a friend.

I would hope so.

55.

No, seriously, I just got a job at a

petting zoo.

Oh, of course.

And the best part is, it's work study. I

think the Psych. department's involved.

Hey, that's my new major. I got so sick

of Soc.

So, uh, got any plans tonight?

Well, there's a great local band playing

the Pub. You should come.

Um, sure. Might be cool to catch a band

before success ruins them.

Great. I'll see you there.

No baskets.

I can't believe what you just did to me!

What?

Julie was just here!

Who's Julie?

Hi. I need socks.

56.

What were you doing sitting in the car

then?

Nothing.

The car pulls up.

I'll be right back.

Me too.

They leave.

Amanda and Scott are alone in the back. Amanda looks tense.

Scott, can I ask you something?

Okay.

It's just that, sometimes, you're really

cool and other times you act like I'm not

even here. Or like you don't want me

around.

Yeah.

Well, I was wondering if... never mind.

Okay.

A moment passes.

All right, look, I'm just going to come

right out with it. I think I like you. I

think I, I really like you.

I know.

As she opens her mouth, Scott opens the car door and exits.

57.

So where are the socks?

An absurd metal band plays on-stage. The room is packed, and

the crowd is mostly one big mosh pit.

Max wades through the slamdancers, freaked. He makes it to

the coffee bar. Julie soon appears, sweaty. She's been here

awhile.

Hey!

Oh, hey! It's good to see you.

The surging crowd shoves Max into Julie. They fall against

each other. Max is near panic but Julie's laughing, getting

off on the energy of the room.

The SINGER smashes the mic against the wall, then brandishes

the stand menacingly at the crowd, who step back in alarm.

Who are these guys?

They're Anhedonia. They're "sludge-core."

You're all a part of the conspiracy!

You're all human! Every one of you wore

diapers! You're all full of shit!

The singer storms off. The band follows. The crowd applauds

with some confusion. Julie whistles loudly and claps.

That's their trademark. They insult the

crowd at the end of the set. Sometimes he

breaks the mike two songs in. We were

lucky: they played for almost 40 minutes.

Luck had nothing to do with it.

58.

Look, the mike's not even broken. They

were just tired of playing, but they

wanted to give us something to remember.

Now that's showmanship.

You have to wonder about any band whose

highlight is their exit.

It worked for The Who.

I'm sorry, the who?

Ha ha. Come on, is that the kind of a

joke a celebrity DJ would make?

I still can't believe you tuned in. It's

like an invasion of privacy.

You're a riot. Let's get out of here.

She pulls him away.

The lounge is empty. Julie sits on a couch. Max sits next to

her, but seems uptight about getting too close.

So, uh, I'm sorry about that thing with,

uh, Chip was it?

Oh, Mark. He's been following me around

for years. He's easily threatened.

He's lucky, I, uh, almost pulled a Jackie

Chan on his ass, but, you know, my kung-

fu's gotten rusty since I left the Hong

Kong military.

Don't worry about him, he isn't a threat.

You're far more interesting.

59.

Right. Asking me not to worry is like

asking a bear to use toilet paper.

There's this joke that sums it up for me...

You're not fooling me, you know. I can

see right through this aloof image.

What?

It's not an insult. I get the sense that

there's this whole other side of your

personality.

I hope he's a better dancer.

See, this is the side you show, playing

everything off as a joke whenever things

gets serious. But there's more to you.

Did I ever tell you about the bear and

the rabbit in the woods--?

Quick. Now. Tell me something about

yourself, something I never would have

guessed. And don't even try to come up

with some witty retort.

I should get going.

Wait.

Okay. Okay.

(a deep breath)

We barely know each other, but you're all

I think about.

60.

(off-balance, covering)

(on the spot)

61.

You don't know what I'm wishing for.

Snowtires?

Max, there are a lot of girls that would

go for a guy like you.

Know any?

This is one of those moments, in a movie,

when a character has a chance to say

something, and of course they do, and

it's perfect, and it becomes a movie

moment.

Julie starts to lean in. Suddenly, the BUILDING MANAGER walks

in. He's a dead ringer for Woody Allen. Max starts violently.

Building's closing. Everyone out.

He exits. Max is beside himself. Julie sees that the moment's

over and gets up.

Are you hungry at all?

Sure. I know this place. Their food is

bad, but they compensate by being

overpriced.

Sounds perfect.

They walk out.

Say, did that guy look like...?

Ernest Borgnine? Yeah, I noticed that

too.

Max is relaxed and chatting while Julie drives.

62.

I've been able to do it since high

school.

That's a scary gift. I mean, even if

people are destined to break up, the will

to stay together is very powerful.

That's the real tragedy. Look at all the

unhappy couples in the world.

I don't know if your gift is really that

special, Max. I mean, we break up with

everyone we ever date... Until the one we

stay with forever.

See how ridiculous dating is?

How did you get this attitude if you love

Annie Hall?

What do you mean? That's what Annie's all

about.

..."college radio for the masses," and

that's it for me.

(sound of CDs falling)

Whoops! Anyway, next up is Verbal

Diarrhea, with Todd Duke.

Why is your radio set to the campus

station?

Actually, it's stuck on it. It's how I

first heard your show.

I thought Beth told you about me.

It doesn't matter, Max. Now that I've met

you, your show's not important.

63.

The kind of place that's perfect for Parents Weekend. At this

late hour, it is filled with young professionals. There's a

dance floor, where couples dance to the standards. Max and

Julie are at a table in the corner, looking out of place.

This is a nice place. Ritzy. Interesting

mix of people here, you've got these men

with their suits, taking their waitress

girlfriends out to impress them into bed,

because they can't get them any other

way. Really, as if a fast car can ever

make up for a small dick.

If it did, do you think I'd be here? I'd

be down at the Porsche dealer with a ski

mask and an Uzi.

Guys, always obsessed with dick size.

Well, sure, there's that, but it would

also be nice to have a car with a heater.

Let's guess which couples are destined to

break up. How about them?

Indicates a COUPLE dancing.

No, I can't tell just by looking. I need

some info.

Their waitress, DONNA, arrives.

Hi! Do you have a boyfriend?

Max is aghast. Donna stares a beat.

Yeah.

What do you need to know?

64.

Uh, just a description.

Describe him for us. It's okay, I'm a

psyche major.

Well, he's tall... ish. Brown hair. Funny.

Very friendly. Fixes cars. Close with his

brother. Uh, what else? Believes in God.

Has a sweet tooth. Uh...

That's plenty.

So can I take your order?

We're not ready, thanks.

So what was that all about then?

Max here thinks you're going to break up

with your boyfriend.

What?

Sorry. It's all in there. You qualified

"tall" so as not to make him appear too

handsome, said "friendly" like a

euphemism, chose "fixes cars" instead of

the more dignified "auto mechanic," and

finally, mentioned his brother a propos

of nothing, like you're threatened by

him.

Hey! Don't shoot the messenger!

I'm such an idiot. She's going to shit in

our food now. I can't believe you asked

her that.

65.

Hey, we're all people here, right? If you

want to talk to someone, talk to them. I

don't spend my time trying to justify

talking to people or whatever. You limit

yourself if you do that. If you spend too

much time worrying, you don't spend

enough time living, right?

What are you, a fortune cookie?

You have to keep yourself open to

possibilities in life. I'm the first one

in my family to go to college. Sometimes

I can't believe I'm here, at a semi-

prestigious university getting a halfway-

decent education-- this has always been

my dream. How did you end up here?

I had a coupon.

I know what you mean, financial aid is a

bitch. And the university experience

itself is kind of disappointing. All

those rich students with no idea how

lucky they are. But I don't think about

them. I think about me, I think about

where I want to be someday: a world

traveler, running some huge company, or,

you know, doing some fantastically

important work. And when the day comes

that I can relax, I'm going to charter a

boat, sail around the world, and see the

Seven Wonders.

I thought they broke up when Stevie left.

Come on, aren't you curious about the

world? Doesn't the sheer scope of life

fill you with wonder?

Wonder, horror, it's such a fine line...

Ah, Max...

66.

Tommy sleeps while the TV proclaims golf products. Max comes

in and quietly shuts it off. Tommy gurgles and rolls over.

...swallowed a bug...

Max goes to his room. Sam's bed is empty. He shakes his head,

picks up a key from his desk, and leaves.

Max sits on a stool, as in the beginning, but this time we

are PUSHING IN...

Sometimes I look around and wonder where

the hell my friends came from.

Tommy and Sam are in each other's faces, yelling. Tommy waves

a book and Sam waves a newspaper.

MAX (V.O.)

Like, the other night Tommy and Sam

nearly got into a fistfight over whether

the X-Files is based on a true story.

Charles makes out with a GIRL in a stall covered in colored

paper. She has a cigarette on a black holding stem, which

brushes the paper.

MAX (V.O.)

Before that, Scott covered the entire

bathroom in multi-colored post-it notes,

which Charles somehow set on fire, nearly

getting us kicked out of housing.

Max, Sam, Scott, and Tommy are there, reading fanclub

newsletters: X-philes, Font-ain of Youth, Men Are From Mars

Women From Venus. Charles walks in, arm in arm with a woman

who is obviously a PROFESSOR, and escorts her to his room.

MAX (V.O.)

They're great friends. I feel safer among

them than among my own family.

67.

MAX (V.O.) (cont'd)

They always know what not to say, how not

to make things uncomfortable.

After a beat, the group resumes reading like nothing

happened... except Max, who can't believe what he just saw.

Max in CLOSE-UP. Over his shoulder, images of Beth arguing

with him from various moments in their history.

Even when Beth was part of the group, she

didn't fit in. Like, she never just lets

things be. She always has to know exactly

what I'm thinking. It was sort of cute

when we were friends, but now it's like a

proctology exam.

Hard to imagine a friendship going more

wrong.

The image of Beth STOPS on a shot of her looking at him with

undisguised disappointment. She DISSOLVES into a image of

Julie, beaming.

Ah, but Julie. Juliejuliejulie. She's

smart, she's funny, isn't constantly

hassling me. How she can stay such a

dreamer is beyond me... Hey, I wonder if

she's listening now.

The thought stops him cold. The image over his shoulder

VANISHES, replaced with a plain cement wall.

We ZOOM OUT fast. Max is back in reality, the station crowded

and claustrophobic. He tries to regroup.

(taps the mike)

Hello? Uh, Julie...?

(clears his throat)

So, uh, as I was saying... Um. My friends.

Yeah. My friends are weird. Shit.

I think it's time for some music.

He grabs for a CD.

TITLE CARD: white on black: "THURSDAY"

68.

Max and Charles stir their coffee.

Fuckin' hate this flavored shit. Anyway,

I can't believe the cat in the shag

jacket was Andy.

I don't want to talk about it.

When I knew him as a freshman, he was pre-

law... Whew. Anyway, it sounds like things

are going well between you and Julie.

Yeah. This is a real change of pace.

Staying away from Annie Hall is like some

kind of magic trick.

I was wondering about that. You seem

different lately.

You know how when things are going badly,

there are certain parts I like to watch?

Like how you spent your whole sophomore

year watching that lobster scene on

repeat?

I realized that I don't know what part to

watch when things are going well.

You know, I actually regret mentioning

that theory. In fact, Sam and I were

thinking of watching it tonight. You in?

Are you on crack? I meet a girl I really

like, that I may actually have a chance

with, and you want me to put it all in

jeopardy?

Come on. Watching it without you would be

weird. Unnatural. That film is you, Max,

face it.

69.

But it's ruining my life.

Listen, Max. I have to tell you

something. I scored last night.

See? The theory works for you, too.

With Beth.

What?!

It wasn't premeditated.

How could you sleep with Beth?

Look, nobody knows about it. It won't

happen again.

Happen again? Of course not! That might

constitute a relationship!

I'm sorry, Max. I wasn't sure if you'd

care.

I don't care! Oh God, this is my fault!

If only I hadn't called her...

What do you want me to say? I'm sorry,

man. Let me pay for your coffee.

You've gotta be kidding.

70.

Going back to the suite?

I dunno where I'm going.

Max, distressed, passes the campus theater, where someone is

tacking up a poster for Annie Hall. Max sees it and averts

his eyes.

He walks past the Kidney Bean. Something catches his eye

through the window. He changes direction and enters.

Max sees Beth eating alone at a table, reading a Tom Robbins

book. He walks over. Beth isn't thrilled to see him.

Max? What are you doing here? A sudden

craving for bird-seed?

Yeah. I figured I'd had enough actual

food this week.

Well, be careful, someone in the corner

is eating egg salad.

Max sits down across from her. After an awkward pause:

Are you okay?

Yeah, why?

No reason. Something about you sounded

different.

What? Now?

No, actually, last night on the... Oh no,

he's here.

71.

But I just left him in the General Store...

Who is he with? He never calls me

anymore. I think he might be seeing

someone. Have you heard anything?

I don't even know him. What's so special

about this guy, anyway? I mean, are you

and he...?

Sort of. Well, no, I guess not.

I know something's going on. I'm such a

fool. Why are we always attracted to

people that are completely wrong for us?

Is it because they excite us?

I guess so. You know, we should try to be

more exciting. Like the other day, I

waited until the last minute before

returning a video. And next time, I swear

I'm not going to rewind.

I can be a rebel too. The other day I

went to bed without flossing.

Boy, are we pathetic.

Okay, it's pathetic, but we're okay, you

know? But sometimes, I feel like...

Yeah. Me too.

I'm glad you're here, Max. I didn't

realize how much I missed you.

72.

I feel the same way about the Sex

Pistols. Missing them is far cooler than

having them around.

That's not what I meant, Max.

She heads for the exit.

Sam looks dubiously at Max, who waves his arms and shouts.

What do you mean, you saw Julie with

someone?

Just that. Nothing more.

So what are you saying?

Nothing. They were having lunch.

Who was he? What did he look like?

You're over-reacting.

How could she see someone else?

You're not even dating!

But we might be! I can't handle

competition, Sam, I'm not the competitive

type.

It was just lunch in the cafeteria. He

looked completely normal.

I can't compete with that!

(he fumbles with his coat)

Man, it's all gone so wrong, so fast.

He rushes out the door.

73.

Max knocks on the door to Julie's suite. Nothing. He paces,

frustrated. Suddenly, JUDY comes out of a stairwell.

Hello? Can I help you?

Yeah, do you know where Julie is?

Hey! Are you Max?

Yeah...

Oh wow! You're just like she described.

Hi, I'm Judy. I'm sure she mentions me

all the time.

Oh, yeah, Judy. Right.

Judy unlocks the door and holds it open.

Come in, come in. Make yourself at home.

Uh, thanks.

Max enters cautiously. The common room couldn't be more

different than his own, clean and tasteful.

Judy hangs her coat up.

This may be completely inappropriate, but

can I ask you something? The tattoo did

it hurt?

Uhhhh... No! I mean, not much.

Why didn't you use your frat's logo?

74.

Well, uh, the guy said it's too hard to

draw two grown men kissing. Say, which

one is Julie's room?

On the left. She's got the single.

So...! Uh, do I come here often, would you

say?

JUDY (O.S.)

What?

Max! What are you doing here?

Judy let me in!

You know, I think I'm going to get a

tattoo, too.

Judy, Mark has the tattoo. This is Max.

What? You're Max?

Yeah, isn't he great?

Sure.

What a surprise! What brings you here?

I was, uh, in the area and thought I'd

pop in. Find out how your day went.

75.

It was excellent, how was yours?

Great. I had lunch with a dear, dear

friend.

Yeah? Anyone I know?

Probably not. She's a foreign exchange

student. Spends a lot of time modeling.

Really?

Yeah, the agencies won't leave her alone.

We had, uh, quite a lunch. Lots of

shellfish, and wine. And, uh, rhino's

horn.

For lunch?

Well, yeah, uh, she's on the kosher meal

plan. Look, I gotta go. Nice seeing you

again.

He splits, leaving Julie wondering what that was all about.

Outside, Max beats himself in the forehead several times.

Then, a picture of misery, he trudges off--

He walks in on someone doing a show. He leaves dejectedly.

He goes back to his suite, where Sam and Jen sit like

statues, watching "The X-Files." He makes a quick exit.

Passes by Julie's dorm again.

Eventually finds himself approaching the University Center.

76.

A ska band plays "These Boots Were Made For Walking" before

two small lines of skanking rude boys.

Charles is alone at the bar. Max sits down beside him.

I just made an ass of myself.

Oh, is it the weekend already?

Ha-ha.

Don't worry about it. Your troubles don't

compare. Sara blew up at Stacy and nearly

destroyed our first rehearsal.

Yeah, you've got real problems. Do you

have time to talk?

Uh-oh, here she comes.

Charles! Can you believe Stacy at

rehearsal?!

She jumps on the stool next to him. Charles turns to Max for

help but he's already gone.

TITLE CARD: white on black: "FRIDAY"

Max plays video hockey. Charles comes in.

Studying for a test?

You shouldn't talk, theater major.

Hey, I have a test on lighting next week

that'll make your hair go grey.

He sprawls on the couch.

77.

Thanks for bailing on me last night. I

had to hear Sara gab for an hour.

Why didn't you just leave? At least you

can escape your problems.

What do you mean?

I just got my textbooks for this term.

Holy shit.

When the gods give you a sign like that,

there's only one thing to do.

By the way, I saw Julie last night.

Was she alone?

Not if you count this huge purse she had.

She was rummaging through it and finally

had to dump the thing out. I swear, I'm

surprised Kennedy's brain didn't fall out

of that thing. Anyway, it made me think

of Annie Hall.

Oh, great.

Although Julie dresses better.

What are you saying, I like her because

she's like Annie Hall?

I didn't say that.

78.

Oh my God, I think you're right.

I didn't say that.

I don't want to like someone because she

reminds me of someone in a movie. Now I'm

wondering why I like her. Maybe I don't.

Good Lord, Max. Take some harder classes.

Sam returns, sees what they are playing.

Look at you two. Wouldn't something else

be fun for a change? How about Goldeneye?

Great game.

No. I don't know how to play it.

Lucky for you, I actually have time to

teach you. Normally I would be having

lunch with Jen.

Oh, shit, I forgot about lunch!

Max gets up and runs out. Charles and Sam exchange a look.

Man, he'll do anything to avoid change,

won't he?

Beth is alone, working on a salad. Max runs up and jumps into

the booth.

(not looking up)

So glad you could make it.

Hey, I'm here, right?

Thank God for small favors.

79.

I'm sorry. Are you still upset about the

thing with Steve?

Yeah, a little. This semester isn't

shaping up too well. It's tough getting

back into the groove of things and, you

know, being on campus. Yourself?

Well, you know. Nothing even worth

mentioning.

But there's something? Really?

It's nothing.

Who is it? Do I know her?

Actually, um, yeah, it's Julie.

Julie! She's great. Why aren't you

thrilled?

Well, I'm not sure I'm that into her.

This I gotta hear.

She reminds everyone of Annie Hall.

Well, of course, why do you think I sent

her to you?

God, I'm such an idiot! That film is

finding more and more ways to ruin my

life.

What're you talking about?

80.

Look at my life. Look at this thing with

Julie.

Jeez, she's not like Annie when the film

starts, she's like Annie at the end. Or

maybe, the Millennium Edition.

The worst part is, maybe I knew this all

along.

Max, what's really the problem here?

And Annie Hall's not even my type.

You have a type?

I'm into bipeds with most of their teeth.

No Lutherans or fictional characters.

Who would you rather sleep with, Julie or

Annie Hall?

That's not two choices, that's one.

Okay, Annie Hall or me?

Stop delaying. This is a serious

hypothetical question.

Well, I must admit, it would be... Annie

Hall.

Don't feel bad, you came in second.

I'll take what I can get.

81.

It's only because you'd laugh at more of

my jokes in bed. It adds a whole other

dimension-- you'd be laughing with me in

addition to at me.

You joke while you're in bed?

Yeah.

That's so weird.

I'm weird.

No, it's weird because I do the same

thing. Guys find it annoying.

Girls think I'm a loser.

Julie doesn't. And you really like her.

Yeah. It's corny, but there's something

about her that brings me happiness.

Happiness? Max, you wouldn't know what to

do with it if you had it.

Max frantically cleans up all the pizza boxes, wrappers, and

empties. Charles leans on the wall, arms crossed.

You've gotta be kidding.

Look, either go somewhere else, or stay

in your room.

Can't I even meet her?

You already did.

82.

Max stuff the trash with paper, squirts lighter fluid all

over it, and takes Annie Hall from the shelf.

What are you doing?

Julie's coming over to watch a movie. I

don't want to take any chances.

He carries the tape over the trash but Charles snatches it

from him.

Dude, Sam and I were gonna watch that.

Annoyed, he puts it back on the shelf and goes to his room.

The doorbell RINGS. Max smooths his hair one last time...

Max and Julie browse a shelf full of videos.

Since Scott joined a video club, we've

got a lot of shitty movies you'll ever

Oo, here's Buffalo `66, that's a

need.

great flick.

It is, but I saw it a couple of weeks

ago. I don't think I can sit through it

again. You mentioned something about

Annie Hall the other night. Do you have

that lying around?

Ummm, no.

Isn't that it on the end there?

No.

Sure it is.

Um, no, it's just the box. The tape

inside is wrestling.

83.

No, it isn't.

Um, it's been recorded over...

You don't believe your friend's theory,

right?

No, of course not.

Because it's insulting. A cop-out.

I, I know, it's just, I watched it last

week. How about Airplane?

Oh, good idea. But next time, Annie Hall.

Max puts in Airplane. Julie and Max sit on a couch together.

Airplane plays. Julie and Max share a blanket. Max turns

toward Julie just as she turns toward him, and their lips end

up in the same place. Julie pulls back.

What are you?

Huh?

Why did you back away?

Why did you?

It wasn't me, I wouldn't have backed

away.

Really? I'll, I'll have to remember that

later.

84.

Actually, my memory's not what it used to

be. If I don't act on this information

now...

Ow.

Sorry.

No, it's okay.

Are you comfortable, I mean, is this

okay?

It's okay. Shut up already.

You're crazy! You know how important your

sense of smell is?

Come on! What about touch? Missing the

smell of rotting milk is hardly equal to

not being able to enjoy sex.

Oh, hey, Max.

Hey. Guys, um, this is Julie. Julie, this

is my roommate Sam, and that's Tommy, who

also lives here.

Nice to meet you guys, but I was just

leaving.

85.

What?

I have work to do before class tomorrow.

But the movie is... Okay. Do you want me to

walk you home?

Sure, all right. Boys, nice to meet you.

Max leaves with Julie.

Bye.

Okay, so what about body odor, then?

Max and Julie collapse onto the pillows, exhausted from sex.

Her room is extremely disorganized, decorated in an

idiosyncratic mix of punk rock icons and nature scenery.

I wish I had a cigarette.

I wish I smoked.

Me too. It's strangely sexy when guys

smoke.

Yeah, and it's the only thing between me

and my dream of becoming Steve McQueen.

They lie in each other's warmth, under the blanket.

So. You and Beth are pretty close, huh?

You call that pillow talk?

We used to be. There were times I would

have been lost without her. Other times,

it was like the lost leading the lost.

She really cares about you.

86.

We tried something once, but it was a

disaster.

It's great that you're still friends.

Sometimes I'm not sure if I have a say in

it. On a campus this small, it's like

she's everywhere.

Sometimes this place annoys me. There's

so much bullshit. My semester off was the

right idea. What happened to old-

fashioned hard work?

That's what summers are for. The school

year is for reckless debauchery.

Jesus, I have to get going. I'll never

get my homework done if I sleep all

weekend. Ah, fuck it, who cares.

Why not just set your tuition on fire?

This, coming from the girl who thinks

college is bullshit.

So, get on up, lazy.

How can you be shy, after, you know...?

It's different. Some things aren't quite

as impressive in the light of day.

You have a problem with nudity.

87.

Of course not. I'm a big fan of it.

Max picks up his pants. Julie taps him on the shoulder and

flicks the sheet up to flash him. He starts and drops them.

She laughs.

It's too easy.

Max puts his jeans on, shoves his underwear and socks in his

pocket.

What are you doing tomorrow?

A double-shift, I get out at five. This

week's gonna suck. I have homework that

can't be avoided.

The worst kind.

Max is dressed. They smooch. Max leaves. Julie lies in bed,

thoughtful.

Nick Cave begins to croon "Into My Arms"...

Max leaves the building and stops to look at the winter

sunrise.

SUPER: black on white: "SATURDAY"

I don't believe

In an interventionist God

But I know, darling

That you do

Students work in the library as light refracts through

icicles in the window.

But if I did

I would kneel down and ask Him

Not to intervene

When it came to you

A boy and a girl hold hands as they cross an icy street.

Squirrels play in the light.

The sun reflects off the University Center windows and back

onto the snow.

Not to touch a hair on your head

To leave you as you are

But if He felt He had to direct you

Direct you into my arms...

The lights are low. Max is at the console, staring into

space. Nick Cave is playing softly on the monitors.

Into my arms... oh Lord...

Into my arms... oh Lord...

The phone RINGS. Max snaps out of his reverie and stares at

it in horror. After several rings, he answers it.

Hello. Nobody is here right now. Please

leave a message. BEEEEEEEP.

SPLIT SCREEN between Max and

Julie, in bed, smoking.

Nice try, Max. I thought you had homework

and stuff, you liar. Great song, by the

way.

You're listening? I told you not to

listen!

Come on, you're funny, you have good

taste in music...

Hey, where'd the music go?

89.

Two STUDENTS, lying in bed together, listen to the radio.

JULIE (O.S.)

(on the radio)

I don't know.

MAX (O.S.)

(on the radio)

I don't get it, it stopped when I picked

up the phone.

Max pushes up a slider and hears the following coming out

over the monitors:

JULIE (O.S.)

I'm just calling to say that you left

your underpants and took mine.

Max reacts, then SCREECHING FEEDBACK rips over the airwaves.

Woah!

Continue SPLIT SCREEN with

Where Julie is frantically pulling the chord out of the back

of her radio.

Max fades the phone out, the music up.

Don't be too proud of your five seconds

of fame. More people would hear us if we

shouted out the window.

My radio days are over, I'm now deaf.

Didn't I tell you not to listen to my

show?

You were only playing music.

Well, all these songs are about you.

90.

Wow... You're a real piece of work, you

know that, Max?

Max enters and takes off his coat. Sam sits up, annoyed.

Man, I'm sorry. Go back to sleep.

What's the point? I have to be up in 15

minutes anyway. Not that I could sleep.

I didn't sleep either, but for some

reason I'm still refreshed. I feel great.

Sam stares at him.

What the fuck is your problem?

It's Julie. Last night we officially

became a couple.

Officially?

We hooked up.

That doesn't mean anything.

It meant something to me.

Sam considers him.

I don't believe you. Just last week you

told me the happy should be quarantined.

I don't know you anymore.

Still down about Jen, huh?

We broke up for good last night.

He gets out of bed and starts dressing.

91.

Oh, man, I'm sorry.

I thought I knew what I was doing. Ever

since she became my girlfriend, I've felt

more and more constricted. Like I was

trapped under the weight of the label.

"My girlfriend." "Her boyfriend."

You guys were together a long time.

Yeah, we were.

Have fun in Saturday lab.

Ah, eat shit and die.

Max is alone, playing "Goldeneye" with a dopey smile on his

face. Charles comes in, rolls of blueprints under his arm.

What's this, "Goldeneye"?

Charles sits and they play against each other.

Yeah...

Have you been here all day?

Yeah, this game's so much fun.

Max, gotta tell you, you're really

creeping me out.

Tommy comes out of his room, dressed in a shirt and tie.

Sam said the same thing. He's still

depressed.

Still can't believe he broke up with Jen.

I saw her yesterday and she looked sad.

92.

I asked her how she was doing, and she

said "Fine," and asked me why I was

asking.

A non-denial denial. I invented that.

She's learned from the best.

I saw her, too. She didn't seem upset to

me.

I was hanging with Sara. That girl pisses

me off! She'll say the dumbest things,

like, the Breeders are better than the

Beatles.

Happiness is a warm gun.

I wouldn't go that far. She's just a

daffy dame, that's all. Now, Stacy's

foxy, but she's too serious.

What about Beth?

What about her?

You just came from Jen's, huh?

Yeah, we just broke up for good.

Oh, man, I'm sorry. Was it you or her?

Me. Us. Both. It was just time, I guess.

(puts down the joystick)

I have to go, uh, mail a letter or

something.

93.

Well, that took the wind out of my sails.

What's up with you? Got another date with

Amanda?

It wasn't a date.

A no-show, huh?

Yeah, but it's okay. Today's her

birthday, and she invited me out for

dinner at a nice restaurant.

She invited all of us.

Oh? Well, that's cool, too.

It's barely lunch, why are you dressed

up?

I don't want to wait til the last minute

to pick out my clothes.

Are you really wearing that tie?

Damn, I knew this was the wrong one!

He runs into his room. Charles laughs at him.

I don't wanna go to a birthday party. I'm

broke, and I wanna hang out with Julie.

So take her. And pray Sara's not there.

Max and Julie walk through the snow together, toward a

parking lot. She's taking deep drags off a cigarette.

94.

This has been some crazy week. I still

have a six page paper due Monday.

Six pages? That's nothing. Triple spaced,

in 14 point type, that's only like 500

words. If a picture's worth a thousand

words, that's like a bad photocopy.

Don't worry about it, I needed a break.

Good to get out and enjoy the weather.

What are you, from Maine?

No.

Phew, because I don't know if I'd be able

to handle something like that. That's a

hard thing to drop on a person.

I'm from northern Vermont. Not too far

from Canada.

Shit, I'm sorry.

It sucked but I managed. Read a lot. Had

a few close friends. That's all you need.

It's quiet up there, dull but nice.

It sounds it.

They get to her car, and he surprises her by kissing her. She

responds, after a hesitation.

Max sits tensely in the passenger seat.

Look out for that truck!

The truck's about two blocks away.

Will you relax? I know how to drive.

95.

Watch the driveway!

I've got it under control, Max!

Anyway, everyone's dying to meet you.

Oh, yeah?

She drags on her cigarette.

This is going to be fun. All my friends,

meeting my girlfriend. It's going to be

great.

Did you just call me your girlfriend?

Uh, yeah...

Ah well, I guess that's alright.

Boyfriend.

She looks at Max and smiles.

We PAN around a long table: Beth at one end, then Jen and

Sam, Charles (looking annoyed) and Sara, Tommy at the other

end, then Scott and Amanda, and two chairs. Everyone's

talking and looking at menus.

Max and Julie enter. Max looks around, paranoid. He sees

Donna the waitress glaring at him, and hurries after Julie,

who is already at the table introducing herself.

Beth, I can't believe you're graduating

so early.

What, really?

96.

Yeah. I've spent my life learning how to

be a student, and at the end of the

semester it will all be useless.

Everybody already wants to know what I'm

going to do, and I have no idea. I

started making up stories to tell people.

An aunt asked me if I'm excited about

Chicago, and I couldn't remember if I'd

said I was moving to the city or going to

see the band.

Something similar once happened to me,

except I didn't know Nashville Pussy was

a band.

I can't believe I'm graduating. My whole

life, I've known what was next. But when

I graduate, the next step is... something?

Something that pays the bills.

My grandfather once told me that if you

love your job, you'll never work a day in

your life. He's 98 years old, addicted to

C-SPAN, and had to be removed from a

supermarket recently for shouting about

Republicans.

Now I know where you get it from.

You should do whatever makes you happy.

Grad school baby. Stay out of the real

world as long as possible.

I can't believe I'm graduating next year.

I already have a recurring nightmare

about it.

You have plenty of time, dear.

97.

Come on, Charles, show a little dignity.

Dignity? You've been following me around

like a lost dog since break, and you're

talking about dignity?! You're always in

my way, I can't get away from you!

What are you talking about?!

If they're making me sick, that's my

business! Leave me alone already!

Fine!

We make you sick? Sam, say something to

him!

Why should I? We've made him sick for

years.

How dare you!

It's true!

You think everything's okay if it's true,

but some things are true and not okay!

When are you going to realize I'm a

different person and entitled to my

opinion? It's my goddamn life!

98.

Please, guys, it's my birthday. We're

here to celebrate.

"Can't we all just get along?"

Goddamn it, Scott, I am so sick of you

making fun of me! You are the meanest

person I've ever met and I don't know why

anybody even talks to you! You are such

an asshole!

Sorry.

Are you ready to order?

No. Yes.

Yes. No.

Why don't I come back?

Ah... So... Julie. I heard you switched

majors.

Yes, I'm Psych now. I didn't like Soc.

I'm a Soc. major.

99.

Oh sorry, I just meant, I needed

something more, ya know, relevant.

Psych is relevant?

Well, look, I'm only in college for the

degree. Most of the stuff they teach us

is pointless anyway.

Heheh, I bet that's why they call it

"academic."

College is a great opportunity. It's

about more than getting a job.

Yeah, it's about avoiding the real world

for as long as possible.

I work in theater, so this is great

training for me.

You call theater the real world?

Hey!

Some of us work really hard to get

through school.

Look, my parents worked their whole lives

to give me the opportunity to be here.

But the truth is, private schools like

ours make money by showing students a

good time for four years. It's bullshit.

You think social work is bullshit?

100.

That's not what I--

This "bullshit" is going to put me in

debt for the next forty years.

Julie punches Max in the thigh. He jumps, blinks.

Why don't you just drop out if

everything's such bullshit?

So what's everybody going to order then?

God. What a bunch of spoiled, whiny

college brats.

Nobody has anything more to say. Everyone looks away. Max is

shell-shocked.

I'm gonna work for NASA!

Julie's car pulls up. Her bumper sticker: "EAT ANIMALS, DON'T

Max opens the door, gets halfway out, turns back.

Are you sure?

No, it's okay. I just need a few hours to

work.

It'll be fun, just the two of us.

Julie lights a cigarette off her old one.

Okay, see you later.

She peels out.

Max straightens up. Scott comes out of his bedroom.

101.

If she stands you up, are we still not

allowed in here? It's my time to watch

"South Park."

Why would she do that?

It's already past eleven.

There's a KNOCK on the door.

See?

Max gets the door. Scott exits, disappointed. Julie enters,

smoking.

Hey. Sorry I'm late. You wouldn't believe

what cross-campus traffic was like.

That's the worst excuse I ever heard. I

mean it. So... you wanna hit the video

store?

No, you've got something here that I've

been looking forward to all week.

She grabs Annie Hall from the shelf.

Ah, shit, no.

You must face your fears. Relax, it's a

very positive film. You just have to know

how to look at it. It's really

refreshingly positive.

The closing credits are rolling. Max and Julie look somewhat

disconcerted.

Boy, what an uplifting movie. Such a

refreshingly positive message.

102.

Right?

You know, I think I prefer Manhattan.

How can you say that? Annie Hall is so

uplifting!

It's just deeper, more sophisticated, I

guess. Listen, thanks for dinner and the

movie tonight, but I should get going.

But it's still early.

I don't know if this is a good idea right

now.

Okay, how about right... now?

Listen, since the other night, I've been

doing some thinking...

There's your mistake. Mindless happiness

is always better than thoughtful

reservation. Unless you're talking about

nude bungee jumping.

I don't think that this is a good time

for us to jump, or leap, or whatever, you

know, together. Into a relationship.

But, but... we just saw a movie about how

relationships are worth it, no matter

what happens.

103.

Did we?

Yeah, I guess we really did.

Well, you're right, Max, and this

relationship was worth it.

Was? Is. Wait... Oh, shit!

Are you okay? Will you please calm down?

I like you very much, but I told you, I

just got out of a serious relationship,

and it ended really badly. We saw each

other almost every day at the beginning,

but by the end of the semester, I hadn't

seen him in a month. He stopped returning

my calls and stuff, and I mean, he

basically avoided me, then I heard he was

seeing one of my friends.

But that was him, not me.

It's nobody's fault, I know. I mean, I've

been trying but it's hard. Relationships

are very difficult to maintain. There are

so few successful couples.

What's successful? Like, my parents have

been married thirty years, but--

My parents are divorced.

Okay, bad example. But why think ahead?

We're here, now. Can't we just enjoy our

time together?

Max, I did, believe me.

What was all this, I mean, was any of it

104.

I don't know what I was doing. I didn't

think about where this might lead until

it was too late.

But it might lead to... happiness.

Uh, re-run.

Say something. Are you okay?

I knew that damn film was cursed! Why did

I listen to Charles instead of Annie?

Jesus, Max. It's not an anti-relationship

movie.

What are you talking about? It's a

fucking textbook.

You're not listening to me, Max. Just

like you're not listening to Annie. No

matter what you think right now, this was

worth it. Because I got to meet you, and

got to be close to you.

I know. I don't know. I mean... Good-bye.

105.

PAN left to right across people's chests: an X-Files shirt, a

lounge shirt with a wide collar, a Stephen Hawking shirt, an

Ani DiFranco shirt...

PULL BACK to reveal, l to r, Sam, Charles, Tommy and Amanda,

sprawled on the couches, from Max's POV in the doorway.

They're drinking vodka out of coffee mugs. The TV is on but

the sound is off. Everyone looks tired and sad.

Max sits. Sam thumbs a copy of Scientific American.

Why are humans smarter than chimps if we

have 99% of the same genetic material?

Who says we're smarter?

Look who I'm asking. You think a red

blood cell is a prison for a gang member.

Very funny, Mr. Wizard. If I learned

anything useful in my classes, I'd be

rubbing it in your face.

In Scott's usual spot is Amanda and Tommy.

So Amanda. Have a good weekend?

Yeah.

Mine was good too. Get any good birthday

presents?

Yeah.

She gets up and leaves the room.

By the way, Max, what ever happened with

that girl you were seeing?

She just ended a long relationship and

she doesn't want anything serious.

106.

Can't you have something that's not so

serious?

No, it's dead. And the thing I don't get

is, it was all going so well. There was a

moment when we kissed, when it was more

than a kiss...

It was like we broke through all our

layers, you know, all the manners and

defense mechanisms and daily crap, and I

saw a flash of something, a glimmer of

hope or happiness or whatever, something

I inspired in her. But now it's over and

I'll never see that part of her again.

I think you're upset about not seeing

some other parts of her again.

She's a girl, Max. They'll always be a

mystery. You'll never know why they love

you and you'll never know why they don't.

Relationships are incredibly complicated.

Like polypeptide strings. There's an

attraction at first, but if the bonds

don't form right away, nothing can make

the connection work.

There's a metaphor we can all relate to.

It was like with Jen and I. But I know it

was for the best.

I finally dropped out of the play I was

directing, just to get rid of Sara. God,

my career is in shambles.

Tough week all around, huh? How about

some video hockey?

107.

Max gets up and puts on his coat.

I think I prefer Goldeneye.

He leaves. Sam sighs and picks up the remote.

Wanna watch Sports Center?

Nah. I think I'm gonna call Sara...

He gets up and leaves as Sam registers this news. He puts the

remote down.

It is moist and foggy as Max trudges across the deserted

campus.

BETH (O.S.)

Max!

Max stops in the middle of a path as Beth walks up.

Hi there. Happy Valentine's Day.

Oo, witty.

Yeah, I hate Valentine's Day, too. If

you're in love, you're in love. And if

you're not, who wants to think about it?

I want to be in love so badly, don't you?

You know, there's this joke...

Ah, forget it, Max.

You know the joke?

Does a bear shit in the woods?

Yeah, that's the one.

108.

You told it the night of our date. I hate

that joke, Max. It's not a philosophy.

But I think I know what it means now.

Yeah, and it's dreary and depressing,

right?

Not this time.

No?

Beth, I just want to say, before it's all

over and I don't have the chance, that

I'm sorry. For everything. Last semester

and last year.

You mean the world to me, and I was an

idiot to throw it away. You were right:

if I can't be a friend to you, how could

I be a boyfriend? I've done a lot of

things wrong, and I've been confused as

hell, but I think it's time for a change.

Really?

Really.

Then allow me to recommend a movie that

you've never seen before. It's called

Annie Hall.

I was going to see it tonight. Do you

want to join me?

I would love to, but I think you need to

do this alone.

109.

No, you're right.

But I'll see you later?

Sure. After the movie, I'm doing my last

radio show. It's going to be all

requests. You should tune in.

The end of an era.

The start of a new one.

MAX (V.O.) (cont'd)

And that's how I let go of her. Although,

it's probably more honest to say that she

let go of me. Julie, Beth, and Annie.

Three women in my life and I was

desperate for one.

MAX (V.O.) (cont'd)

Of course, I saw her again. It's a small

campus. The last time was at a film

festival. We're better friends now then

ever, and there's always a chance we can

have some kind of future together. So

far, so good.

MAX (V.O.) (cont'd)

She'll always mean a lot to me, and it's

nice to run into her and reminisce about

what we, ya know, went through. It was a

weird period of my life. I mean, shit, I

really got off track there, didn't I?

FADE TO BLACK
