EXT. COLUMBUS, OHIO - DAY

The state capital of Ohio.  It's an impressive building for

a city this size.

SUPERTITLE: COLUMBUS, OHIO - STATE CAPITAL

INT. OHIO STATE SUPREME COURT - DAY

In chambers striving for august, JUSTICES listen to a lawyer

MR. RODMAN, argue his case before the highest court in Ohio.

Mr. Rodman enjoys the sound of his own voice.

One particular justice, ROBERT WAKEFIELD, younger than the

others, is clearly bemused by this performance.

Judge Wakefield interrupts --

A polite chuckle from the justices --

INT. ROBERT'S CHAMBERS - DAY

The office is marble and dark wood.  A young CLERK, black,

29, enters carrying an oddly-shaped gift.  They both look at

it.

They both laugh.  Robert reaches up and pulls a bottle of

Scotch from a shelf.  He pours a couple of fingers in two

glasses.

The clerk takes one of the glasses.

They toast and drink.

EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY

Robert exits, trailed by a small group of reporters.  He

gets into a car being driven by two security TYPES.

INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

Robert sits in a business class window seat.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

An expensive hotel.  Robert Wakefield stands at the window,

looking at the view of our nation's capital.

SUPERTITLE: WASHINGTON D.C.

ON THE TABLE

The remnants of a meal.  It was a steak and a small caesar

salad.  The wine glass is half-empty.

ANOTHER ANGLE ON ROBERT

In front of the mirror now, trying on a dark, tasteful jacket.

CLOSER

On Robert in the same position, only now we are in HIS HOME.

It's daytime, and his wife BARBARA is helping him into this

same jacket.  As her hands dust the lint off his shoulders

ROBERT

In the hotel rooms, making the same motions.  Satisfied, he

straightens, then turns to look at himself.

OMITTED

ANGLE ON ROBERT

Back at the hotel room window now.  Reaches to the table and

lifts the wine glass.

EXT. DIRT ROAD - DAY

This is the middle of nowhere.  Scrub cactus and dust and a

heartless sun.

SUPERTITLE: MEXICO - TWENTY MILES SOUTHWEST OF TIJUANA.

A broken down-looking Police Sedan is parked on the side of

the road.  It seems abandoned except there are TWO MEN inside.

INT. POLICE SEDAN - DAY

Two Mexican men, State Police officers, JAVIER RODRIGUEZ,

30's, and MANUEL "MANOLO" SANCHEZ, 20's, wearing jeans, knock-

off Polo shirts, and cowboy boots, wait patiently in the

car.

A long pause.

Another long pause.

They continue to wait until there is the sound of a JET

ENGINE.  It grows LOUDER as it approaches.

EXT. THE POLICE SEDAN - DAY

The shadow of a large plane crosses the desert floor.  Then,

an old DC-3 flies fifty feet above the Police Sedan.

INT. POLICE SEDAN - DAY

They watch the plane disappear over a small rise in the

desert.  They look at each other and wait some more.

EXT. MEXICAN DESERT - LATER

From the direction of the landing strip, a moving van lumbers

down the road, two TEENAGERS in the cab.

INT. POLICE SEDAN - DAY

Javi and Manolo watch the moving van approach.  Javi reaches

under the seat and picks up a bubble flasher.  He rolls down

the window and plants it on the roof.  He flips the switch.

Nothing happens.  He jiggles the wire and the siren BURPS

and the light flashes.  Manolo and Javi step from the car,

smiling.

EXT. MEXICAN DESERT - DAY

The moving van slows to a stop.  Javi approaches.  The DRIVER

unhurriedly rolls down the window.

The driver hesitates a confused beat then reaches for his

wallet.

The driver pulls a wad of bills.  Javi shakes his head.

Javi shakes his head.  The driver exchanges a look with his

partner.

Javi smiles.  The driver gets out and walks to the back of

the truck.  He opens the rear door.  There are neatly-stacked

crates marked with a SCORPION logo and "911."  He reaches

into one of them and pulls out a tightly-sealed package also

with the scorpion stamped on it.  He turns to see Javi with

his gun drawn.

Manolo, at the passenger side, has also drawn his gun and is

motioning the partner to move to the back of the truck.

The driver hesitates.  He starts to comply then looks at

Javi and Manolo.

Javi motions to Manolo who cuffs both teenagers.  The driver

begins spewing OBSCENITIES under his breath.  Javi puts the

driver in the front of the Shadow.  Manolo follows in the

moving van.

OMITTED

OMITTED

EXT. DIRT ROAD - MEXICO - LATER

The truck follows the Shadow down a desert road.

Suddenly, from behind, four armored SUV's with tinted windows

appear, closing fast.

The SUV's force both vehicles off the road where they pull

to a stop.  A long beat as hot wind blows desert detritus

past the truck.

Finally, the SUV doors open and FEDERAL POLICE OFFICERS

surround them like a SWAT team.

The passenger door of the lead SUV opens and GENERAL ARTURO

SALAZAR, 50's, a squat, powerful presence in a perfectly

pressed uniform gets out and approaches Javi.

Javier stares into the implacable reflection of his

sunglasses.  In the distance, the DC-3 takes off and ROARS

over their heads.

The men follow Salazar's orders.

Salazar looks at Javi a beat.

Javier lights a cigarette.

They start for their car.

EXT. DEL MAR SELF-STORAGE - DAY

SUPERTITLE: SAN DIEGO

Two men, RAY CASTRO, 30's, proud, ambitious, and MONTEL

GORDON, 40's, suspicious of everyone including himself and

always, always the smartest guy in the room, walk from a

Lincoln Towncar toward a dumpy office.  Castro is talking

under his breath --

Castro stretches his arms, swings them around.

They reach the door to the office.  Gordon looks at Castro,

then turns the handle.

INT. OFFICE, DEL MAR SELF-STORAGE - DAY

It's a cluttered, rundown working office unusual only in the

extent of its ordinariness.  A SECRETARY goes about her

business like a somnambulist.  CLERKS shuffle and file.

Castro switches into Spanish --

INT. OFFICE, DEL MAR SELF-STORAGE - LATER

In a back alcove, Castro and Gordon sit across a cheap table

from EDUARDO RUIZ, 40's, an entrepreneur in an expensive

suit and bad hairpiece.  They are waiting.

Another "businessman" enters from another door and whispers

in Ruiz's ear, then leaves again.

One of Ruiz's hands dips under the desk where we see a handgun

is holstered on the underside.

Castro laughs uproariously.

INT. DEA SURVEILLANCE SPACE - DAY

ON FUZZY SURVEILLANCE VIDEO: Castro laughing.  Ruiz politely

smiling, one of his hands hidden by the table.

IN THE OFFICE

The room is filled with crappy surveillance equipment.  DEA

AGENTS, in DEA logo'd outerwear, jiggle a monitor fuzzily

displaying the view from another hidden camera: Gordon and

Ruiz around the cheap table.

ON THE MONITOR

Another "businessman" enters the office and whispers in Ruiz's

ear.

Another AGENT peers out a window through binoculars.

HIS POV: THE EXTERIOR OF THE OFFICE WHERE CASTRO, GORDON,

AND RUIZ TALK.

EXT. DEL MAR SELF-STORAGE, SAN DIEGO - DAY

A BLUE VAN makes a slow turn into the parking lot.

EXT. ROOF - DAY

TWO FBI AGENTS, in jackets reading "FBI," hide on an opposing

roof.  They look through high-powered binoculars.  Binocular

POV: THE BLUE VAN TURNING INTO THE PLAZA.

HIS BINOCULAR POV DETECTS THREE UNMARKED CARS DISCREETLY

FOLLOWING THE VAN.

The unmarked cars split up and one turns into the parking

lot of a fast-food restaurant.  The other circles around the

back of a building.

INT. OFFICE, DEL MAR SELF-STORAGE - CONTINUOUS

Through the window Ruiz, Gordon and Castro watch the van

disappear into the bay of a storage unit.  A man is pulling

down the door behind it when three unmarked squad cars ROAR

into the lot, surrounding the unit, officers exit the cars

with their guns drawn -- Gordon and Castro stare in disbelief.

Ruiz FIRES the gun under the desk which hits Gordon full in

the chest, knocking him backwards.

Ruiz's men run into the room pulling guns.

Castro dives and pulls his weapon, firing at Ruiz's men,

hitting both of them.  Ruiz bolts through another door.

Castro pursues, talking into his shirt collar --

Gordon gets slowly to his feet, shaking off the blast to his

Kevlar, and runs after them.

EXT. DEL MAR SELF-STORAGE - DAY

The DEA are shooting at the men inside the storage unit who

are shooting back.

From all over the stake-out location, DEA AGENTS emerge firing

their weapons.  An equal number of FBI AGENTS emerge firing

in return.  Nobody was aware of the other's presence.

It's CHAOS, a clusterfuck of law-enforcement zeal with three

competing sets of good guys shouting through BULL-HORNS,

GUNSHOTS and SCREAMING.

Ruiz breaks through the corner of the lot, cutting between

two buildings.  Castro emerges and chases him.

EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

Ruiz runs out the back of the storage company.  He cuts

between parked cars, heading for The Fun Zone, a kiddie

restaurant.

INT. THE FUN ZONE - DAY

Castro enters The Fun Zone.  There's a cardboard cutout of

SPASTIC JACK, a beloved comedy figure who looks like a rabbit

version of Jar Jar Binks, promoting the "Special Edition"

glass: "Collect All Four."  There's an enclosure filled with

colored plastic balls.

The restaurant is empty except for a CLOWN filling out a

time card.  The clown stands.

Castro makes a motion for him to be quiet and keeps moving

toward the room of colored balls.

Gordon enters the restaurant and follows him.  An ANIMATRONIC

BAND starts to play a SONG.

Gordon sees a half-hidden foot buried underneath the plastic

balls at the far end of the room.

He takes careful aim and FIRES.

Ruiz SCREAMS and sits up.  Castro pounces on him, disarming

him, and roughing him up.

EXT. THE FUN ZONE - DAY

Castro and Gordon shove Ruiz into the sunlight.  They wait

while their eyes adjust.

Castro shoves him forward.

ACROSS THE PARKING LOT

DEA has opened the back of the van where a quarter-ton of

cocaine is spilling out onto the pavement.

INT. GUEST HOUSE - AFTERNOON

A bong hit is expelled into the air.  In the living room of

a comfortable, preppy guest house, private school TEENAGERS

party and hang-out: cigarettes in ashtrays, beer and bong on

the coffee table, loud MUSIC.

SUPERTITLE: CINCINNATI, OHIO

The TV is on with the sound off.  The curtains are closed.

The four boys wear school blazers with their ties pulled

askew, the three girls' clothing are also identical.  Some

sit on couches, some on the floor.  They are stoned.

One intense-looking boy, SETH ABRAHAMS, 17, wild curly hair

and the attitude of a young Coleridge, and a girl, CAROLINE

WAKEFIELD, 16, really sixteen which means she looks about

12, pretty and flirtatiously irreverent, sit at a desk in

front of a Powerbook G-3 playing an on-line trivia game.

Seth speaks rapidly and precisely.

Seth leans over and snorts a line of coke from a mirror.  He

hands it to Caroline who effortlessly does one.

Seth looks at her.  He has a crush.

She nods.  They both take a swig of beer.  He takes her hand

pulling her past the stoned people on the couch --

IN THE KITCHEN

Seth takes out a box of baking soda.  He tears off a square

of aluminum foil.  He takes out a spoon.  Caroline watches

as he dumps a small amount of cocaine into the spoon.  He

adds a pinch of baking soda.  He puts in a few drops of water.

Stirs it around with the heel of a lighter.  Then holds the

flame under the spoon.

He watches the substance in the spoon as it swirls and

bubbles, then separates... He pours the most viscous part

onto the aluminum foil, making four separate little puddles.

He quickly dismantles a ballpoint pen, making a straw.  He

hands it to Caroline.

He lights the flame under the aluminum foil.  The puddle

crackles and pops, then starts to smoke --

There's a rush of thick grey smoke.  Caroline catches most

of it.

She pulls it in deeper and holds... Suddenly her expression

changes... Her eyes lose their focus, her face slackens, an

almost sexual response.  Seth is watching her intensely.

Caroline slumps back against the counter.  Seth moves against

her, kissing her, running his hands over her breasts and

body.  She stares over his shoulder, holding it as long as

she can.

Finally she exhales --

The cloud of grey smoke from her lungs fills the room.

INT. WHITE HOUSE OFFICE - DAY

The White House CHIEF OF STAFF meets with Robert Wakefield.

The Chief of Staff has the floor; he always has the floor.

This is a man you do not want to disappoint.

INT. EXECUTIVE BUILDING, WASHINGTON, D.C. - DAY

Robert makes his way through a warren of hallways in the

endless corridors of the Old Executive Building alongside

JEFF SHERIDAN, 35, an enthusiastic government employee who

has found his place.

INT. OFFICE OF NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL POLICY - DAY

Robert and Sheridan enter the office of outgoing Drug Czar,

GENERAL RALPH LANDRY, 60's, buzz-cut, professional soldier

with a sense of humor.

Landry is putting some personal items in a box.

Sheridan nods and leaves.

Robert and Landry shake hands.

Landry tries to determine whether Robert believes this.  He

looks around the office as if the policy is hiding somewhere.

General Landry SIGHS.

They stare at each other a beat.  Then Landry smiles.

EXT. MANOLO'S STREET, MEXICO - DAY

A cinderblock house.  Kids and dogs in the street.  A face

we recognize as Manolo's peers out of a curtain into the

street.

INT. MANOLO'S KITCHEN - DAY

The ceiling is stained, the floor sags.  A cheap radio plays.

Manolo is at the door.  Javi sits at a dinette table.

He talks to Manolo but watches Manolo's wife, ANNA, 20's, a

nice-looking, ostensibly demure young woman, as she moves

around the kitchen.

Manolo tenses, and throws open the window.

MANOLO'S POV out the window as KIDS play in the car, sitting

behind the wheel.

Anna sets a cup of coffee in front of Javi and stares at

him.

INT. POLICE SEDAN - DAY

Javi and Manolo cruise through the streets of Tijuana.

EXT. TIJUANA STREET - DAY

Tourist hell.  A cacophony of street venders, panhandlers,

and vehicular traffic.  Javier and Manolo are speaking with

a flustered young American TOURIST COUPLE.

Javier pulls out a note pad and scribbles a number.

There's a beat of confusion.

And then our car appears.

The man reaches in his wallet and offers Javier a twenty.

Javi waves him off.

Javier and Manolo walk back to their squad car when two SUV's

come to a stop in front of them.

Javier and Manolo exchange a look.  The doors SLAM and

FOOTSTEPS approach.

EXT. LA JOLLA GOLF AND TENNIS CLUB - DAY

A ladies luncheon in the Nancy Reagan Dining Room overlooking

a putting green.  The bejewelled WIVES of successful men

yammer at one another around tables with rich flower

centerpieces.

SUPERTITLE: LA JOLLA, CALIFORNIA, JUST OUTSIDE SAN DIEGO

One wife, HELENA AYALA, 32, ex-model, with a sweetness and

intelligence that almost contradicts her beauty, stares out

the window at a small BOY, 5, using a putter as tall as he

is.  Helena is six months pregnant and radiant.

A waiter brings Helena's starter course.  Her friends, NAN

DOBBS, early 40's, post Junior League, a little tipsy,

STEWIE and ALEX, same League, watch her --

Nan can't believe it.

Everyone laughs.  Helena is by far the youngest in her crowd.

Nan reaches for a taste and the other women lean forward

also, a sea of inanity swirling around Helena's salad.

EXT. COUNTRY CLUB PARKING LOT - DAY

Helena buckles her little boy, DAVID, 5, into the front seat

of her Mercedes.  He won't let go of his putter.

She pulls the putter away from the reluctant boy and sets it

on the back seat.

EXT. HOTEL - DAY

A modern high-rise on the waterfront playground of San Diego.

Helena passes the hotel in her car.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

A standard room looking out at the water which is dotted

with sailboats and cruise ships.  The bed is covered with hi-

tech surveillance equipment.

The equipment salesman, LONNIE, 40's, who makes a fetish of

gadgetry, explains the finer points of operation to FRANCISCO

"FRANKIE" FLORES, 30's, sallow, watery-eyed, in expensive

clothes.

He walks over to the bed and the sexy equipment --

Frederico picks up a piece of equipment.

Lonnie lovingly picks up a laptop computer with a sleek device

attached to it --

Francisco looks at Lonnie coldly.

EXT. GEORGETOWN BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

The house takes up most of one of the nicest blocks.  PEOPLE

enter and party VOICES drift out.

SUPERTITLE: GEORGETOWN, WASHINGTON, D.C.

INT. GEORGETOWN BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

A power cocktail party in full swing.  This is where most of

the business in Washington gets done.

Robert, scotch in hand, listens to a smug PHARMACEUTICAL

LOBBYIST explain the world.

The lobbyist smiles.  Robert sips his drink.

ANOTHER ANGLE ON ROBERT

In another room.  Listening to STAN, overweight advocate for

the United States Council of Chambers of Commerce.

ANOTHER ANGLE ON ROBERT

listening to ETHAN, earnest advocate of harm reduction.

Robert turns away --

Tim slips away into the crowd.  Robert moves away from the

bar.

ANOTHER ROOM

An argument is breaking out between an ECONOMIST and an

UNDERSECRETARY OF DEFENSE with Robert as the audience.

Another man, RUSH PHILLIPS, a middle-aged powerbroker,

overhears, then joins and Robert is encircled.

MICHAEL ADLER, about Robert's age, and as successful, but in

a different way, approaches, catching Robert's eye through

the arguing demagogues.

Robert looks at Michael, squints, looks closer, then follows.

ANGLE ON ROBERT AND MICHAEL ON THE BACK PORCH.

INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM, SAN DIEGO - DAY

Eduardo Ruiz lies in a hospital bed, handcuffed to the

railing.  His bandaged foot is held aloft by a sling and a

tube drains the wound.  He is tugging on the handcuffs as

Castro and Gordon enter the room.

A NURSE appears in the doorway.  Gordon goes to the door and

shuts it in her face.

Ruiz looks at them in disbelief.

Gordon and Ruiz stare at each other.

EXT. AYALA HOME - LA JOLLA - DAY

A starter castle high in the hills near Mount Soledad, an

exclusive neighborhood with views of the ocean.  Joggers jog

to the SOUNDS of tennis and Jacuzzis gurgling, and lawn care

equipment operated by Mexicans.

Behind the Ayala gate we see David playing with his golf

club on the lush lawn.

Workers set-up the party under the direction of a professional

party planner.

A BMW 740il with tinted windows pulls into the driveway.

The window lowers and we see CARL AYALA, 40's, handsome,

charismatic, second generation American, in expensive,

conservative clothes, covering his cell phone as he greets

his kids.

He goes back to his phone call, pulling around to the garage.

David goes back to his game.

INT. AYALA DINING ROOM - DAY

There are MAIDS in the house and a COOK in the kitchen.  The

large rooms are filled with fine art.

Helena Ayala sits at the dining room table with plans, bills

and receipts spread before her.  Carl enters and paces around

the room, continuing his cell phone conversation.

Helena watches her husband pace as he talks.  He can't help

it, but a portion of this call is theatrical, for an

audience's benefit, which in this instance happens to be his

wife.  Helena's expression of annoyance resets itself into

love.

Carl clicks off the phone, turns to Helena.

Carl winds down and finally becomes present in the room with

his wife.  He looks at her.  She looks back.

She pushes the topiary away from her.  Suddenly, she seems

tired.  Carl comes over and puts his hand on her pregnant

belly.

Her husband watches her, then wraps his arms around her.

EXT. AYALA HOME - DAY

Carl and Helena step out on the front porch of their home

and watch David play with his golf putter.

OUTSIDE THEIR GATE

An unmarked police car rolls up and stops behind the wall.

Another arrives and another and another.  OFFICERS in DEA

jackets exit the cars.

There is MURMURING, then SILENCE.

Helena slowly turns to look at her husband.  He doesn't look

at her.

Suddenly, POLICE and DEA enter the front yard.  Gordon and

Castro enter the yard and move quickly up the drive to Carl.

Gordon and Castro spin him, cuff him, and without emotion

begin pulling him from his yard.  David is trying to get to

his father.  In a kind of shock.  Helena trails after him.

Castro drags Carl into the street toward the open door of

the cruiser.  He pushes him down into the backseat.

Gordon hits the side of the cruiser and it pulls away.  Carl

looks at his wife through the window.

Gordon and Castro head up the driveway toward her house.

Helena is left standing in the street.  NEIGHBORS, who have

appeared in front yards and at the ends of driveways, stare

at her with suspicion.  David approaches and holds onto her

leg.

INT. SALAZAR'S HEADQUARTERS - ANTEROOM - DAY

Javi and Manolo wait in Salazar's anteroom.  A ceiling fan

swirls the air.  After a moment the door opens and an AIDE

motions to them.  They stand.

Javi goes into the room.

INT. SALAZAR'S OFFICE - DAY

The office is Spartan and military.  Salazar and Javi sit

facing each other.  Salazar looks at a piece of paper.

Salazar crumples the piece of paper and tosses it in the

trash.

Javier thinks about this.

Salazar slides a folder across the desk.  Javier opens it

and sees a black and white surveillance photo of the

informant.

INT. POLICE SEDAN - DAY

Manolo faces Javier.

INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

Robert Wakefield sits in business class.  He twists the cap

He empties a second bottle into the cup, then swirls it around

on the ice.  He takes a sip.

INT. AIRPORT GATE - DAY

Robert exits with his briefcase and hanging bag, two SECURITY

MEN trailing him.  He sees Barbara and Caroline, his wife

INT. CAR - DAY

On the way home from the airport.  Caroline drives carefully

with Barbara in the front seat and Robert in back.

INT. WAKEFIELD DINING ROOM - EVENING

From the hallway we see Robert and Barbara and Caroline having

dinner.  A family tableau.  We hear Barbara talking, the

murmur of the days events.

In the room, Barbara continues her dinner table thoughts.

Robert has a good deal of reading material stacked on the

table.

There is wine on the table and Caroline is allowed a glass.

Her parents watch her take a responsible sip.

Caroline thinks about this.

Robert doesn't know if she's putting him down.

They all look at each other.  Caroline sips her wine.

INT. SAN DIEGO JAIL - DAY

In the intake area of a busy San Diego precinct, Helena sits

on a bench and regroups.  Detectives move past her.

Handcuffed criminals are separated, bagged and tagged.

beautifully dressed man, ARNIE METZGER, 30's, super- lawyer,

knows everyone from the top of the system to the bottom,

slick but likable, smart and ruthless, too, separates himself

from a DETECTIVE he's gladhanding and approaches Helena.

Metzger sits, giving her a hug.

Arnie looks at her as if to say, "do you really not know?"

Then, he speaks quietly with his hand in front of his mouth.

He checks to see if this is registering.

He makes eye contact with her.

EXT. BUILDING PARKING LOT - DAY

Helena exits.  Her expression is set as she drives.  She

turns a corner in the shopping district, passing JAVIER AND

MANOLO who are walking down the street.  Tourists, drunk

Marines and the homeless piss away another day.

We follow them into a bar with blackened windows and a

discrete sign.

INT. BAR - DAY

This is a place where men come to meet men.  And it's already

lively even at this early hour.  Javier and Manolo find a

seat and wait.

ACROSS THE ROOM

Francisco "Frankie" Flowers has entered the bar.  Javi watches

him circulate through the room then settle at the bar.  Javier

finishes his beer, rises, and takes the empty seat next to

Francisco.  Manolo watches.

Very quickly Javi strikes up a conversation.  We don't hear

what they're saying but it doesn't matter because Francisco

clearly likes Javi.

Off Francisco's anticipatory smile --

EXT. MILITARY BASE - MEXICO - DAY

The back of a blue van opens and a blindfolded Francisco

falls onto the ground.

Surrounding him are Javi and Salazar, who watch as two of

Salazar's MEN drag Francisco away toward an abandoned mission-

style building.

EXT. SOMEBODY'S PARENTS' MANSION, CINCINNATI - NIGHT

With its old-growth trees and manipulated shrubbery, the

large house is shrouded in the mystery of well-heeled

suburbia.  It is very late.

INT. SOMEBODY'S PARENTS' MANSION - NIGHT

Somebody's parents are out of town and the house feels empty.

Big empty rooms with expensive furniture nobody sits on.

Faint MUSIC echoes through the house.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

High ceilings of a 1930's kitchen.  Vodka bottles and

cranberry juice and limes are spilled across a counter.  ON

THE RHODES AGAIN by Morcheeba plays from a jam-box on a

counter.

Maybe ten TEENAGERS are partying hard in this kitchen.  It's

weird and disassociated, people wandering in and out, playing

with kitchen utensils, heavily fucked up.

There are drugs on a mirror on the eat-in table.  Caroline

and Seth and two friends sit around this table.  VANESSA,

16, almost pretty, is hitting a freebase pipe and holds the

hit.  FUCKED-UP BOWMAN, 17, super-preppy with a wan, Baby

Huey face, takes a slug of vodka.

They are jittery, sweaty, tweaked, fucked-up --

Everyone looks at Fucked-up Bowman who grinds his jaw

appreciatively --

Seth's words come quickly, they're riffing, totally in sync,

totally wired --

Fucked-up Bowman takes another slug of vodka and almost pukes.

Caroline expels a hit of rock cocaine --

They all look at each other with love.  This is an adventure

and they're having a connection --

Bowman does another huge hit of freebase.

They all look at each other, vibrating with the moment --

Bowman looks around, squinting, confused.  He's chalk white.

Suddenly, he clutches his chest and begins to twitch.  Puke

and foam come from his mouth.  He seizes and falls from the

chair.  Vanessa SCREAMS.

Seth and Caroline push the table aside to get a better look.

Other people in the kitchen slowly take notice.

Bowman's eyes have rolled back in his head.

OMITTED

EXT. SUBURBAN HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ENTRANCE - NIGHT

The Taurus wagon races up to the emergency room of Suburban

Hospital.  The back door opens and Bowman tumbles out onto

the wheelchair ramp under the fluorescent lights.

The car screeches around the circle --

ACROSS THE PARKING LOT

TWO OFFICERS in a police car see the body tumble out of the

car.

The cop car wheels around and cuts off the egress of the

Taurus wagon --

INT. FORD TAURUS WAGON - NIGHT

Seth is behind the wheel.  Caroline and Vanessa are in the

back.  They stare out at the cops getting out of the cruiser.

OMITTED

INT. TORTURE ROOM - BARRACKS - DAY

Francisco is strapped naked into a chair.  Duct tape covers

his mouth.  His face is bruised and swollen.  A cruel TORTURER

talks to him calmly while dumping chili powder into a

container of soda water.

He approaches Francisco and begins shaking up the soda water.

He rips the tape off his mouth.

The torturer puts another strip of duct tape across

Francisco's mouth.

Francisco starts to squirm and whimper.  The torturer closes

one of Francisco's nostrils and sprays the pepper-laced water

into the other nostril.

It's like a bomb went off in Francisco's brain.  He SCREAMS

and passes out.  Blood and mucous oozes out of his nose.

INT. BARRACKS - MEXICAN MILITARY BASE - DAY

Javier stands guard outside a door, listening  to the

strangulated SCREAMS of Francisco.  He's sickened.

ACROSS THE COURTYARD

Manolo ignores Francisco's CRIES, while shooting the shit

with several of Salazar's MEN, who laugh appreciatively at

something he's said.

EXT. AYALA HOME, SAN DIEGO - NIGHT

Valet parkers in uniform work the driveway.  The party is

ablaze and there are lights in the trees.  A Lester Lanin-

like band plays a STANDARD that drifts across the grounds.

EXT. AYALA HOME - NIGHT

A conservative monied crowd mingles.  Helena is talking with

a GROUP of rich people who include her friends, Nan, Stewie

and Alex, from the country-club, and their HUSBANDS.

Helena circles away.  As Helena leaves, the women speak their

minds --

ON THE STAGE

The band stops playing and steps aside as a man in a tuxedo

takes the microphone.  Behind the band is a huge "A.L.A. -

Adult Literacy Advocates" Banner.

INT. JUVENILE DETENTION, CINCINNATI - HOLDING CELL - MORNING

Caroline Wakefield lies on a bench in a grey-walled holding

cell.  She wears paper slippers and her belt has been removed.

Even youth can't disguise her hangover.

INT. SOCIAL WORKER OFFICE - MORNING

Caroline is perched on the edge of her chair.  Across the

desk from her is a tired SOCIAL WORKER, 40's, who has been

assigned Caroline's case and is giving her the "exit"

interview.

The Social worker looks up from her questionnaire and sees

Caroline for the first time.

The social worker pushes the forms she's filling out away

and looks again at Caroline --

INT. JUVENILE DETENTION - MORNING

A cold institutional lobby with hard plastic chairs and bad

lighting.  Government workers move behind thick glass windows

with tiny mesh screens cut into them for talking.

Barbara Wakefield sits on one of the uncomfortable chairs.

She's alone and has been crying.  There's the sound of heavily

locked doors OPENING and Caroline appears.

Barbara stands and wraps Caroline in her arms.

Caroline begins to cry into her mother's chest.

EXT. JUVI JAIL - MORNING

It's an early morning as Barbara Wakefield escorts her

daughter from the bland government building.

The streets are deserted.  Their Saab wagon sits forlornly

under grey skies in an uncovered public parking lot.

INT. DAVID'S ROOM - NIGHT

Helena slips into David's room and quietly watches him sleep.

INT. STUDY - LATER

Still wearing her evening gown, Helena collapses into a chair,

exhausted.  A TAP at the door startles her.

It's Arnie Metzger, who goes to the bar and pours himself a

strong one.  They sit opposite each other and neither speaks

for a while.

Helena is relieved, but she's not looking at Arnie and when

she does she sees him shaking his head in a very definitive,

"No."

Arnie stands and continues talking as he walks to the windows

and shuts the blinds one by one.

The blinds are closed.  Arnie crosses to Helena and talks

very softly in her ear.  She's a beautiful woman and Arnie

manages to make this act seem both practical and

inappropriate.

Helena leans back and looks at Arnie.  He whispers more --

EXT. AYALA HOME - NIGHT

Workers break down the party under the watchful eye of the

party planner.  The neighborhood is quiet.  There is a

telephone repair van parked up the street.

INT. VAN - NIGHT

Castro and Gordon have visual and audio equipment trained on

the Ayala home.  They both wear headsets.

GORDON'S POV: the blinds covering Helena's study glowing

peacefully.

INT. STUDY - NIGHT

The music is still playing.  Helena looks numb.  She motions

Arnie to her.  He leans in.

EXT. WAKEFIELD HOUSE - NIGHT

A large, well-maintained Colonial on Mockingbird Valley Road,

an upper-middle class neighborhood in the wealthy East End

of Cincinnati.  Leaves fall on the Saab wagon in the driveway.

INT. ROBERT'S STUDY - NIGHT

Robert is looking at Caroline and he's not happy.  Barbara

is there, at a neutral distance from both of them.

She looks up beseechingly.

She searches her parents' faces.  It has been a convincing

performance and she expects victory.

Caroline is confused by this reaction.

Caroline stands abruptly --

Caroline leaves the study and shuts the door harder than

necessary.

Robert and Barbara look at each other, raising their eyebrows

and breathing deeply --

Robert looks at his wife, then it dawns on him.

No response.

He leaves the room.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

Robert is in the hallway, at Caroline's door.  He opens it

and we get BLASTED WITH MUSIC.

Caroline is sitting in a rocking chair with headphones on.

She faces the window and moves back and forth, back and forth.

Robert calls her name, but the SOUNDTRACK is drowning him

out.

He calls again, this time apparently loud enough for her to

hear.  She takes the headphones off - the MUSIC stops - and

turns to look at him.  Or rather, she looks right through

him, as though he didn't exist.  Robert is so taken aback by

the coldness of her gaze that he doesn't speak.

She turns away from him and puts the headphones back on.

EXT. MILITARY BASE - MEXICO - DAY

Javier and Salazar walk across the base.  Salazar is feeling

ebullient and it shows.

They enter the barracks.

INT. CELL - MEXICAN MILITARY BASE - DAY

It's pitch black in the cell.  There's a human in here, but

we can't see him.

Suddenly the door is thrown open and light floods in,

illuminating a very broken Francisco Flores.

The figure of Commander Salazar fills the doorway.

Francisco cowers in the corners --

A GUARD appears in the doorway.  Francisco is spooked.

Francisco moves closer to Salazar already feeling safe in

his presence.

INT. COURTHOUSE, SAN DIEGO - DAY

A packed courthouse.  Carl is at the defense table.  He

doesn't look at Helena who sits in the gallery next to Arnie

Metzger.

The PROSECUTOR is finishing his argument --

The prosecutor sits.  Carl's defense lawyer, MICHAEL ADLER,

from the Georgetown party, stands and speaks.

Adler sits.  The JUDGE makes a quick decision.

The judge SLAMS his gavel.  The crowd is on its feet.  Carl

tries to get a glimpse of Helena.  They make eye contact.

Reporters from the press gallery are yelling for Helena.

Arnie ushers her away.

EXT. COURTHOUSE - DAY

Adler, Arnie, and Helena push through a crowd toward her

car.

There are several reporters there who ask questions --

Helena gets into her car and slams the door.  Adler faces

the reporters.

Adler is in a role he relishes.  Helena drives away.  We

move up to Gordon, who is watching from the hotel window

across the street.  He speaks into a walkie-talkie, and a

car down below pulls out to follow Helena.

INT. GOVERNMENT BUILDING - EARLY MORNING

The marble government corridors are empty.  No one is in

yet.

One office has lights on.

INT. A.D.A. KELLY'S OFFICE - EARLY MORNING

Robert Wakefield talks with an Assistant District Attorney,

DAN KELLY, 40's.

A.D.A. Kelly thinks a moment, then tries for tact.

Robert is silent for a beat.

INT. ROBERT'S CAR - EARLY MORNING

Robert in his car, thinking.  The streets are empty.  He

picks up the cell phone.

INT. CAROLINE WAKEFIELD'S BATHROOM - MORNING

Caroline sits on the toilet in her private bathroom.  She's

not going to the bathroom, it's a seat and she's wearing her

pajamas.  She's reading a magazine.  The exhaust fan is on.

There are pictures of her and her friends on the walls: goofy

pictures from camp, from school, a collage she's made with

cutouts from magazine pictures and copy.

On the sink next to her is a little square of well-charred

aluminum foil; she's done many hits.  She leans over and

picks up a small piece of crack cocaine from a small pile in

her soap dish.  She drops it on a clean place on the foil.

She picks up a lighter and the tube of a ball point pen she's

turned into a straw.

She heats the bottom of the foil.  The crack "crackles."

She chases the smoke across the foil.  A huge hit.  She leans

her head back, her eyes roll back, she tries to focus on the

magazine, on anything, she stares up at the ceiling.

She holds it as long as she can then blows it toward the

exhaust fan.

Caroline looks at her watch.  It's 7:20.  She stands suddenly,

unsteadily.  She looks at herself in the mirror.

She's really high and indecisive.  She looks around wildly.

She sees the shower.  She turns it on.  She drops her pajamas.

She goes back to the foil and hits another piece of the rock,

taking another really big hit.  She crushes the foil and

flushes it down the toilet.  She hops in the shower.

IN THE SHOWER

The water streams over her face.  After a long beat she

finally exhales the smoke of the hit through the water and

steam.  She's in ecstacy.

It's almost time to leave for school.

EXT. LA JOLLA PLAYGROUND - DAY

Helena reads a book, Madame Bovary by Gustave Flaubert, and

keeps an eye on David, who is playing on the monkey bars.

ACROSS THE ROAD at a careful distance is the ubiquitous

telephone repair van.  On the roof a parabolic mike swivels

around.

INT. TELEPHONE REPAIR VAN - DAY

Castro and Gordon watch Helena via a small surveillance

monitor.

Gordon looks at the monitor --

The man is very good.  He juggles the ball and bounces it

off his head and David follows him away from the center of

the playground.

EXT. PLAYGROUND - CONTINUOUS

Helena notices David moving away while playing with the man.

She follows, then begins to jog after them.

As she closes distance the man stops juggling the ball and

abruptly picks up David and begins swinging him around by

his arms.  David is having fun as Helena approaches.

The strange man swings David up so that he's under his arm.

The man holds David.

The strange man holds David tighter so that he's no longer

having fun.  He begins to wriggle --

This gets her attention --

David begins to cry.  Helena looks around wildly for help.

He drops David who runs to his mother.

The strange man moves away across the field.

He continues walking away.

INT. TELEPHONE REPAIR VAN - DAY

Gordon and Castro stare with rapt attention.

EXT. BARRACKS - NIGHT

Javier and Manolo stand guard outside the front door of the

dining hall.  Javi smokes a cigarette.

INT. DINING HALL - BARRACKS - NIGHT

Francisco and Salazar eat at a beautifully set table.  They

are waited on by military officers who serve perfect flan at

the end of the meal.

A soldier pours another glass of red for Francisco.

Francisco begins to weep.

Salazar slides a pad of paper toward Francisco who slowly

begins writing.

EXT. TIJUANA NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

Manolo and Javier pound on the front door of an apartment.

A MAN opens the door and they grab him.

EXT. TIJUANA - DAY

An SUV pulls up to a curb.

Castro and Gordon sit with Eduardo Ruiz in a conference room.

They are recording his statements.

EXT. TIJUANA - SAN DIEGO BORDER CROSSING - DAY

Car after car, an unending multi-lane stream of vehicles

moving into the U.S.  Any of these cars could be carrying

drugs.

INT. CUSTOMS CONTROL BOOTH - DAY

On an elevated walkway, this booth commands a view of

everything.  Robert and Sheridan listen to an OFFICIAL give

the spiel.

Robert looks out at the border activity.  It's anarchy.

INT. AYALA STUDY - AFTERNOON

Helena is on the floor surrounded by papers.  She's made

piles of certain things: articles of incorporation,

shipping/transfer documentation, bank statements, credit

card statements.  She holds a telephone to her ear --

Helena walks into her kitchen.  It's serene in the afternoon

light.  She fixes ice-cold lemonade and fills two plastic

cups.

Helena hangs up the phone.  She takes the two cups of lemonade

to the front door and steps outside.

EXT. AYALA HOME - AFTERNOON

Helena carries the cups down the driveway.  She presses a

button and the gates swing open.

INT. TELEPHONE REPAIR VAN - AFTERNOON

Gordon and Castro listen to their headsets.  Suddenly --

Castro and Gordon looks at each other.

There's a KNOCKING at the door of the van.

Gordon opens the door.  Helena is standing there with the

lemonade.

She hands the cups to him.  Helena gathers herself.

They shut the door to the van and sit for a moment.

Gordon takes a big sip of his.

EXT. TIJUANA STREET - MORNING

This is a questionable neighborhood pushed up against the

edge of poverty.

Anna hurries across the street.

EXT. JAVI'S APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING

Anna walks up the stairs of a rundown building.  She passes

two PROSTITUTES loitering in the stairwell.

She knocks on a door and Javi, half-dressed for work, answers.

He's surprised to see her.

He lets her into the apartment.

INT. JAVI'S APARTMENT - MORNING

A small, clean room with a partition for the sleeping area.

She pulls out a plastic packet with the scorpion insignia

and 911 stamped on it.

Javier thinks a beat.

EXT. ALLEY - TIJUANA - DAY

Javi slams Manolo against the side of building.

Manolo is sweaty and crazy-eyed.

EXT. COFFEE KIOSK - TIJUANA - DAY

Javi buys a cup of coffee.  He turns.  Two men, who will

come to be known as AGENT HUGHES and AGENT JOHNSON, are

standing close.  Agent Hughes speaks without looking at him.

Hughes sticks a business card in Javi's pocket.  Javi watches

them walk away.  It's all done so smoothly and quickly, it's

over before Javi even knows what happened.

EXT. WEST END - CINCINNATI - DAY

It's the bad part of urban Cincinnati in the daylight:

projects and blighted row houses.  Seth and Caroline walk

with a slouched, alert air.  In their mind's eye they are

prep-school gangsters following a familiar route.

They turn down a street with a lot of activity on it.

TWO YOUNG STREET DEALERS fall in step with them.  One talks

without moving his lips --

One dealer hurries ahead toward the doorway of a falling-

down building.

The dealer looks them over.  He looks behind them down the

street.

Seth and Caroline are suspicious.  They carefully show money

they both have in their front right pockets.  The dealer

feints like he might grab it.

They hurry up the steps into the dingy brownstone.

INT. ROW HOUSE - DAY

They step into the narrow foyer between the outer door and

the inner door.  There are three other PEOPLE waiting

nervously.  An older JUNKIE shoots them a crazy look --

They wait.  Finally, the first dealer appears in the inner

door and lets them through.

INT. FIRST FLOOR CORRIDOR - DAY

They wait in a line in the narrow, poorly lit corridor.  At

the end of the hall a hatch in a door slides back and the

drugstore is open.  People buy and leave.

Seth and Caroline approach.  In the hatch is a hardened

dealer, 20's, named SKETCH, which is tattooed on his forearm.

He checks out Caroline's body.

She hands over her money to Seth who pays and gets the drugs:

gram baggies of rock stamped with a scorpion and "911," and

wax-paper bindles of heroin, also labeled, "911."

Caroline has been watching the transaction.  Sketch makes

slow eye contact with Caroline.  After a beat --

Seth and Caroline make their way out of the building.

EXT. BUILDING - DAY

Seth and Caroline hold hands as they hurry down the steps.

The lookout speaks without moving his lips.

Caroline stops suddenly.  She pulls Seth to her and kisses

him hard.  There's no better moment than the one right after

scoring before you start using.

EXT. VILLA ELAINE - DAY

A flophouse of the seediest variety: wino in the doorway,

prostitute taking care of business, everyone fresh out of

institutions and graveyards.

INT. VILLA ELAINE - DAY

They approach the front desk which is behind six inches of

glass.

INT. ROOM 205 - VILLA ELAINE - DAY

They enter and the light bulb goes out.  Seth fumbles his

way to the mini-fridge, which he opens, throwing feeble light

across the floor.

They check out the decrepit room: the sloping mattress, the

black and white television bolted to the bureau.  The mini-

fridge.  Caroline bounces on the bed.  They are teenagers.

Seth prepares the drugs by the light of the mini-fridge.

Seth dumps the drugs on the bedside table.  From other pockets

he extracts aluminum foil, lighter, tube.  She trails away

watching him fix the first hit.

He prepares the first hit.  She does it and lies back.  He

does one.

Seth starts kissing her.  They try to get into it, but both

of them are thinking about the drugs.

She leans over to snort a tiny line of heroin.

Caroline's distracted by the line she's snorting.  After a

while...

Seth begins undoing her jeans.

INT. EPIC BUNKER LOBBY - DAY

SUPERTITLE: EL PASO, TEXAS

agents minding their own business,

Robert, Sheridan, and their Epic Guide walk through.  They

pass a wall of black and white head shots --

of colored balloons.

EXT. TRAMAC - DAY

Robert, walking with purpose, leads his group to their plane.

INT. MILITARY JET - DAY

Robert and Sheridan and several DEA, Law Enforcement, and

Military Officials.  It's a nice plane, used for important

people and Robert has the best seat.

The men on the plane just stare at him.  Finally the REP

FROM DEA leans forward.

Robert turns to the others.

Still, no one else says anything.  They watch Robert

impassively.

Helena and Arnie enter his office.  The furniture is sleek

mid-century modern, and the view of the harbor is

Arnie stands very close to Helena and looks at her profile.

Arnie thinks.

There isn't.  Helena looks Arnie in the eyes.

It takes a great effort for Arnie not to answer.

INT. ARMORED SUV - MEXICO - DAY

Javier and Manolo ride through a nice neighborhood in Mexico

City.  Javi isn't familiar with the roads and drives

cautiously.

A young lady, ROSARIO, early 20's, sexy and vulnerable, rides

in the back of the SUV.

Manolo laughs and looks her up and down.  Javi watches her

in the rearview mirror.

Javi says nothing.

Javi just looks at her in the rearview mirror.

Javier pulls the SUV to the curb in front of a beautiful

colonial-style apartment complex in the verdant neighborhood.

EXT. VERDANT NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

Birds are chirping.  Javi waits in the car as Manolo takes

the young lady's bags from the vehicle and carries them up

the walkway to the arched doorway.  He knocks on the heavy

wooden door.

Manolo knocks again.  They wait a long beat.

Finally, the door swings open and a BODYGUARD is standing

there.  Rosario SQUEALS and sweeps past him into the vast

space.  The bodyguard motions for Manolo to put the bags

inside the door.

Manolo sets the bags down and sees another MAN standing a

few feet away.  The man wears sunglasses.  His complexion is

strange and his neck is bandaged.

The body guard escorts Manolo back outside where he hears

Rosario's happy LAUGHTER drifting down from an upstairs

window.

INT. SUV - DAY

Manolo gets into the truck.  He's shaken by what he's just

seen.

A long beat as Javier considers this.

Javier calmly drives away.

INT. BARBARA'S CAR - NIGHT

Barbara drives Robert home from the airport.  There's a sense

they've been silent for a while.

A long silence.

Another silence.

She looks at him, stung.

EXT. WAKEFIELD HOUSE - NIGHT

He car pulls into the driveway.  Robert gets out.  Barbara

doesn't.  He looks back at her.

She puts the car in reverse and drives away.  He stands for

a moment, steaming.

INT. WAKEFIELD HOUSE - NIGHT

Robert Wakefield steps inside his home.    It's very QUIET.

He checks the mail on the hall table.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

Robert walks down the hallway.  He steps into Caroline's

bedroom.

INT. CAROLINE WAKEFIELD'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Robert stands outside her closed bathroom door.

There is nothing, then from the other side of the door, the

faint sound of a lighter CLICKING.  AGAIN and AGAIN, then a

COUGH.

INT. CAROLINE WAKEFIELD'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

Caroline sits on the toilet.  Glamour Magazine on her lap.

She's wild-eyed and paranoid.  The exhaust fan is running.

The aluminum foil is on the sink.  The last little bit of

heroin in a wax-paper bundle sits beside it.

She's listening hard for any SOUND in the house.  What she's

wondering is if someone is outside the door listening.

She puts a piece of crack on the foil and listens hard once

more before lighting it.  She does the hit.

And seems to feel better.

Suddenly there's a POUNDING on the door.  The VOICE of her

father muffled through the solid wood.

Caroline is up like a shot.  She looks around.  The POUNDING

on the door gets stronger.

She crumples the foil and drops it in the toilet.

The bathroom door SOUNDS like it's about to cave inward.

She's coping now, full parallel process mode: she dumps the

last heroin on the back of her hand and snorts it, checking

her nose in the mirror as she reaches for a can of air

freshener which she sprays into the air.

She takes the remaining crack, lighters, tubes, little smudgy

druggy bits of paraphernalia and carefully places it all in

a hiding place above the bathroom cabinet.

She pauses a beat, then opens the door, and tries to brush

by her father while avoiding his eyes.

Robert grabs her by the arms.  He pushes her against the

wall and looks at her pupils.  He looks at her fingernails.

The blister on her thumb from working the lighter is red and

irritated.

She stands there; she's very high.

Robert sniffs the air.  He throws open cabinets, searching

for drugs.  He sees the smudge mark on the counter left by

the charred aluminum foil.

Robert KICKS the cabinets.

Robert is losing it.  He throws stuff around the bathroom

and then, for the first time, looks up.  He sees the long

light in the box atop the medicine cabinet and it dawns on

him.

She just stares.

Robert reaches above the medicine cabinet and pulls out a

charred spoon.  It confuses him.  He throws it into the sink.

He pulls out another spoon.  He pulls out crumpled bindles,

rolled up, encrusted dollar bills, exhausted lighters, a

pill bottle, an empty pint of vodka.

The detritus of drug addiction keeps on coming, filling up

the sink.  Robert stares at it, the amount and complexity

has him momentarily baffled.

INT.  - SAN DIEGO - DAY

Javier drinks toward downtown.  He's sipping a Burger King

soft-drink.  On the seat next to him is a shopping bag from

Target.  He takes an exit.  Javier pulls into the underground

parking lot of a fancy office tower.

INT. POLICE SEDAN - DAY

Javi drives down to the third floor underground.  He pulls

into a parking spot next to a white sedan.  He slides open

Special Agents Hughes and Johnson welcome Javi.

Hughes sticks out his hand.

Javi starts to get out of the pool.

away.

INT. SEDAN - DAY

Agents Hughes turns to Agent Johnson.

INT. JAIL VISITATION ROOM - DAY

Helena and Carl each hold a telephone receiver as they stare

at each other through a thick pane of meshed glass.  Helena

is barely holding it together.  It's hard for Carl to see

her like this.  After a beat --

She can't even look at him.

Carl looks at his wife as if he is trying to weigh her.  He

thinks, then leans forward --

That painting is very valuable.

EXT. SERENITY OAKS - DAY

A peaceful wooded campus with a unobtrusive sign reading,

"Serenity Oaks Treatment Facility."

INT. MEETING ROOM - SERENITY OAKS - DAY

There are sayings on the wall: "Easy Does It;" "Let Go and

Let God;" "Turn it over;" "One Day at a Time..." "H.A.L.T. --

Hungry?  Angry?  Lonely?  Tired?"

Caroline, wearing a thick, woolly sweater, and the other

PATIENTS sit around on beat-up couches and chairs in a loose

circle.  It's a mixed BUNCH: trucker meth-head, rocker dope-

fiend, yuppie crack-head, fat, thin, rich, middle-class, and

all white.  Caroline is the youngest.

MARTY, 40's, an overweight alcoholic, finishes his "share."

And Marty looks to Caroline who didn't relate to one word he

said.

People in the room nod encouragingly.

She blushes, and stares out the window.

INT. AYALA LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

Helena follows an ART APPRAISER through her formal living

room as he inspects paintings and makes notations.  He is

very excited and moves quickly from one to the next.

The appraiser taps out some numbers on a calculator and shows

the figure to Helena.

Helena turns her back.  She walks to a window and looks out,

then surveys the contents of her beautiful home.

Helena turns and sees David in the doorway.  She goes to

him.

The art appraiser passes them on his way out.

INT. AYALA MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

Her eyes are wide open.  She has had a thought --

She climbs out of bed and quickly puts on a robe.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Helena walks quickly and quietly down the hallway.  She passes

David's room.  She opens a door at the end of the hall --

INT. CARL'S PRIVATE STUDY - CONTINUOUS

Helena enters the room.  She hits a desk lamp and we're in a

very comfortable and masculine upstairs study: bookshelves

holding hundreds of art books; comfortable chairs; MacIntosh

stereo; discreet flatscreen HD TV.

Helena stares at a painting on one of the bookshelves.  It

is "Boy with a Hoop," a small portrait by Rafael Colonel.

She goes to it and looks from different angles.  She reaches

out and jiggles the oil.  Nothing happens.  She looks behind

the painting at the backing.

She notices that one corner is not glued down.  She picks up

a letter opener and pries the paper back.  An envelope slips

out.

Inside the envelope: neat, thin strips of paper dense with

information in a miniscule type and a magnetic key card.

There are more AGENTS inside and old food and coffee

containers.  Gordon gives Ruiz a tour.  There are several

rooms.  A bored Castro sits at a table staring at a Scrabble

board.

Ruiz looks around with disgust.  He's accustomed to finer

places.  He goes to a window and looks out.

INT. SKETCH'S BEDROOM - DAY

A single candle lights the room.  Caroline is underneath

Sketch the drug dealer.  He is pounding away.  As she clutches

his back and holds on, her expression is both surprised and

druggy, and SOUNDS escape her mouth that she wouldn't believe

she could make.

There's a KNOCK on the door.  Sketch continues his business.

The KNOCKING is more insistent.  Finally, he stops and gets

up and goes to the door.  Caroline lies back.  She's in a

bed with black sheets in a room with nothing else in it but

a dresser and some duffle bags.

Sketch opens the door --

SOMEBODY outside says something.  Sketch walks over to a

duffle bag and extracts some product.  Caroline's eyes are

glued to it as Sketch hands it through the door.  Sketch

sees her staring at the drugs.

He comes back to bed.

Caroline nods.

She turns her back to him, pouting.  He laughs.

He reaches over beside the bed where there is a small tray.

On the tray is a rig, spoon, several powders, and an eye

dropper.  He pulls the candle over and rapidly fixes a

speedball.  He pulls the fluid into the neck of the syringe

and holds it up the light.  It has Caroline transfixed.

He squirts the tiniest amount of fluid into the air.  It

arcs in the candlelight.

She nods.

Her concentration is entirely, hypnotically focused on the

syringe.

Sketch moves the syringe toward her lips.

Caroline moves her mouth toward the side of the syringe, her

lips part.

Sketch pulls the sheet back, exposing her legs.  He grips

one powerful hand around her ankle and squeezes... Veins

stand out on her foot.

He slides the needle into the largest vein and slowly

depresses the plunger.

Caroline watches, then her head tilts back, then forward,

she GROANS, sexually and slumps against the pillows, her

eyes half-open, her lips twitching.

Sketch puts the rig back on the tray, then admires Caroline's

beauty for a second before starting to fuck her again.

The cruiser pulls into a fenced and gated parking lot.

Gordon, Castro and Ruiz, walking with a limp, cross to the

As they push inside, Francisco Flores, in a conservative

grey suit passes them going outside.

The parking lot is empty of people.  The guards at the gate

talk about something distracting.

Francisco passes by the cruiser and drops his keys.  Kneeling

down he extracts a small, powerful, magnetized bomb from his

jacket.  He attaches it to the underside of the vehicle,

stands and walks toward the guard gate.

Francisco steps from the car and mingles in with OTHER PEOPLE

walking along the sidewalk.  He follows them for few yards,

picking his moment.

He closes the distance to Gordon, Castro and Ruiz, pulling a

pistol from inside his jacket.  He takes careful aim from

twelve feet away and is about to shoot Ruiz when a bullet

hole appears in his chest.  He staggers, trying to squeeze

the trigger, Francisco fires the gun once, wildly --

A tourist screams --

Gordon and Castro and Ruiz turn --

Francisco is looking down at the widening red splotch in the

center of his shirt, uncertain of what has happened --

Gordon shoves Ruiz down into a doorway and fires three quick

shots --

Francisco spins around and drops on his face in the street.

Citizens run in all directions fearing a psychopath with an

INT. SIDEWALK CAFE - SAN DIEGO - DAY

A fire truck and paramedic unit WHIZZES by.  Manolo sits at

an outdoor cafe table, waiting.  He can't help looking around

at the attractive people, but he's also nervous.

Suddenly two MEN, recognizable as Salazar's OFFICERS from

the desert drug bust, sitting at a nearby table, rise and

move to Manolo's table.

They take seats uncomfortably close to Manolo.

You're looking around like you're expecting someone.

They each take Manolo by an arm.

INT. SUV - DAY

We're looking through the windshield as we approach the

official as he looks in briefly and waves us through.  We

continue to pan to reveal Manolo in the backseat sitting

beside Man #2.

Javi hesitates before turning.  We're on Javi as we hear the

grave.

Javi stands there, waiting.

Javi shakes his head.  Finally, another GUNSHOT.  After a

beat, a hand reaches out of Javi's shoulder.

They walk back to the SUV.

Javi says nothing, doesn't even acknowledge them.  We hear a

GUNSHOT.

INT. AYALA HOME - DAY

Arnie Metzger is in Helena's living room.  The stereo is

has been here in a while.  There are toys - plastic dolls,

frisbees, hula hoops - on many of the tables.

Helena lets herself into the room.  She scans ledgers. She

looks over the equipment.

She picks up a twelve-inch high plastic Spastic Jack action

figure and a can labeled "solvent" and hurries from the lab.

EXT. WEST END - CINCINNATI - NIGHT

Robert drives through the streets, searching for Caroline.

He doesn't find her.

INT. WAKEFIELD HOUSE - NIGHT

Barbara is waiting in the living room.  Robert enters.  He

shakes his head then stands silently for a beat.

INT. CAROLINE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Robert is standing in the middle of her room.  He's not sure

what he's looking for.  Everywhere he looks: her personal

things, beloved objects from more innocent times, pictures.

Within moments a legitimate desire to connect with his

daughter has escalated into a search for clues.  He opens

her drawers, dumps little boxes, pulls things off of shelves.

He becomes increasingly unhinged, flinging things around her

room.  He tosses a stack of magazines.  A fashion magazine,

airborne, discharges some contents: a lighter, a plastic

tube and a piece of folded aluminum foil fluttering to the

ground.

Robert stares at the foil on the carpet.  It's charred on

the outside.  He picks it up.  And unfolds it.  There's a

dried milky white substance.

He picks up the tube and lighter and stares at them.  Then,

somewhat tentatively, he puts the tube in his mouth.  He

holds the lighter under the foil, then heats the milky

substance which turns translucent and disappears in a cloud

of smoke.  Robert sucks all of it in.

He waits a long time then exhales.  His eyes shut.  The tube

drops from his mouth.  He staggers and, overwhelmed by the

sensations, sits on the bed.  The lighter and foil fall from

his hands.

A moment later he opens his eyes and doesn't seem to know

where he is.  He looks at the room, confused.  He stumbles

to the door and shuts it firmly behind him.

INT. MANOLO'S HOUSE - DAY

Anna is weeping.  Javier sits next to her.  He puts his arm

around her and she leans her head against his shoulder.

INT. JAVIER'S SUV - DAY

Javi drives through the streets of Tijuana.  He brakes for a

stop sign and watches, trance-like, the pedestrians crossing

in front of him.  As the intersection clears he remains still.

A HONK from behind brings him back and he pulls forward

passing Helena Ayala who crosses going the opposite direction.

We stay with her.

EXT. TIJUANA - DAY

Helena walks down a nightlife street that is tawdry and stale

in the midday sun.

A shrewd Obregon Lieutenant, JUAN MARQUEZ, 40, sits at a

table opposite Helena.  The Strange Man who both threatened

Helena's child and executed Francisco sits in another chair.

Helena nods to Tigrillo --

Helena reaches into her bag and pulls out the Spastic Jack

action figure.  She puts it on the desk.

Juan Marquez is confused.

Juan picks up Spastic Jack and looks at him.  He bangs it on

the desk.

She takes out the "solvent" and puts it on his desk.

INT. CLUB PLATINUM - OFFICE - LATER

Spastic Jack is slowly dissolving in a bowl of solvent.

Only his shoulders, head, and ridiculous ears remain above

the quicksand of milky glop.

Helena holds a mirror under the desk lamp.  She is drying

the paste.  She puts the mirror on the desk.  A white

substance has coagulated there.

Juan takes out a razor blade and chops the dried substance

into two white powder lines.  He hands a silver straw to

Helena.

She stands.  He watches her a beat, then smiles.

He leans down and quickly snorts a line.  After a beat.

Helena waits.  Juan Marquez reaches in his desk and pulls

out a quarter kilo of cocaine.  He pushes it across the desk.

She puts the quarter key in her bag and stands.

Tigrillo escorts her out of the room.

signals that she has to stop.

the tape recorder and looks at the polygraph operator who

nods approval.  Hughes and Johnson exchange a look.  They

are dumbstruck.

notice this and exchange looks.

kilo baggy identical to the one Juan Obregon gave her in

Tijuana.

Helena puts the bag in her purse.

I flushed it in the bathroom of their godawful nightclub.

paper.

puts the food in front of Ruiz who uncovers the sausage and

eggs.

feeding you?

Applause from the assembled PRESS.  The Press Secretary

the Chief of Staff; he stares out at the expectant faces and

television lights and camera flashes.

Robert is becoming increasingly uneasy.  He glances at the

Chief of Staff who bores into him.  He looks again at his

speech.  With great effort he continues.

Robert stops again as though the words are choking him.
