note pad and pen, and Jonah is on a computer. They smoke a joint

and drink beers.

Martin, listen. You don't shave your

beard or cut your hair for one year,

and if you can do that, I will pay

your rent. But if you shave, then you

have to pay all five of our rents.

Thanks for the free money, bitch.

Hey, Martin, was it weird when you

joined the Taliban, being American and

everything like that? Like when you

see a woman driving a car, do you just

get pissed?

Just watch your back, Serpico. You

never know who your friends are.

You guy can't make fun of the me the

whole time.

But, Martin, it's a competition. It's

called "The Dirty Man Competition."

We're gonna make fun of you until you

shave the beard. That's the rules.

That's the whole point. You're

supposed to be tempted into shaving.

Your face looks like Robin Williams'

knuckles.

You guys aren't allowed to make fun of

me. It's not part of the rules.

Martin, why didn't you just listen to

me when I was explaining the rules?

You just looked at me with that blank

stare of yours. It was like talking to

a wax statue.

Okay, guys, are you ready? So... "Only

at `Flesh of the Stars.com' will

customers be able to find exactly how

long into what movies their favorite

stars are exposed."

makeup for three hours. I can't do it.

I'm not going to be here. I got to do

"American Idol." It's live. I got to

do it. I got to be there. What are we

going to interview her about?

Nothing personal.

No personal questions.

No personal questions. Don't ask her

about her sister and her nose job.

No plastic surgery questions.

She doesn't want to talk about her

boobs or her father's comments about

her boobs.

Great. We'll talk about the Middle

East and maybe an idea of an exit

strategy. Maybe she has a good pitch.

Should I ask her about Korea? Maybe

have her point it out to us on a

globe? I don't understand the young

talent in this town! It doesn't make

any sense. I got four jobs. Hell, I'm

more famous than half the people we

talk to anyway! No one stands up. No

one has the balls to sit them down and

say, "Look, just cut the shit."But

everybody works for `em. They're all

on the payroll. They're all sucking

the teat! Nobody sits `em down, eye-to-

eye, one-on-one, and says... "Cut the

shit." And all these stars just to

fuck it up. That's what they do. They

fuck my day up! And it pisses me off!

And now I'm sweating.

You know what? You want us to just

come and get you when she gets here?

You want to head to the green room for

a minute? Just chill out?

That's a good idea.

Tough job.

About the work, most immediately,

there's going to be some things that

you're going to be able to get that

other people in the office don't get.

One of them: Gym membership.

You want me to lose weight?

I don't want you to lose weight.

We can't legally ask you to do that.

We didn't say lose weight.

No.

I might say "tighten."

"Tight."

A little...tighter?

Just like toned and smaller.

Don't make everything smaller. I don't

Yeah. Last night was great...what I

remember of it?

Right, yeah.

Yeah.

We had a great time.

Yeah. So what do you do?

I work at E!

The television channel?

Uh-huh, remember?

Wow.

We had, we had this conversation last

night. I, I told you about my

promotion and I was out celebrating

it. No?

I don't remember that at all.

I'm super excited about it. I'm

actually doing my first on-air

interview today.

With who?

Matthew Fox.

Matthew Fox from "Lost?"

Yeah.

You know what's interesting about him?

What?

Nothing. Will you tell him he's an

asshole for me?

No.

Someone needs to. Like who gives a

shit?

I hope a lot of people actually

because that's what my job entails, is

making sure people care about what he

has to say. I'm interviewing him.

Maybe it's just me. Maybe I just don't

give a shit. I'm just saying he

deserves a beat down.

It's sort of embarrassing to ask at

this point, but what do you do for

work?

Me and my roommates have

started...we're starting an Internet

website.

Oh, cool, what is it?

I'll give you the virtual experience

okay? How's that? You're at your

computer. Who's an actress you like?

Mary Tyler Moore?

No, that does not work at all. Let's

say you love Meg Ryan.

I do.

Great. Who doesn't? Let's say you like

her so much, you want to know every

movie where she shows her tits. And

not just that, but how long into that

movie she shows her tits. Come to our

web page, exclusively, type in `Meg

Ryan.' Bam! `In the Cut,' thirty-eight

minutes in, forty-eight minutes in,

like an hour and ten minutes in. She's

like naked that whole fuckin' movie.

She does full-frontal in that movie.

Wow.

They should have called her Harry, not

Sally.

I'll show it to you. I'll show you Meg

Ryan's bush.

really get to talk much last time so I

That we didn't.

I thought maybe we'd just talk and get

to know each other...better.

Cool. Okay, I'll start. I'm Canadian.

That's cool.

From Vancouver. I live here illegally,

actually. Don't tell anyone. But it

works out in my advantage, ultimately,

`cause I don't have to pay any taxes.

So financially that's helpful `cause I

don't have a lot of money. I'm not

poor or anything but I eat a lot of

spaghetti.

So the web page is it just something

that you guys do for fun? Do you have

a real job?

Well, that is our job.

Oh.

We don't technically get money for the

hours we put in, but it is our job.

So, how do you...?

How do I pay rent and shit?

Right.

When I was in high school, I got ran

over by a postal truck.

It was my foot more than anything.

But, I got fourteen grand from the

British Columbia government.

Right.

And that really lasted me until now.

It's been almost ten years. I have

like nine hundred bucks left. So that

should last me for I'm not a

mathematician, but like another two

years or some shit...I think.

Yeah. So, I have something I really

need to tell you. It's kind of why I

called you. Here it goes. I'm

pregnant.

Fuck off.

What?

What?

I'm pregnant...?

With emotion?

With a baby. You're the father.

I'm the father.

Yes!

How the fuck could this happen?

I don't know. I thought you were

wearing a condom.

No.

What?

I wasn't.

Why not?

Because you told me not to.

What are you talking about?

What am I talking about? You told me

not to.

I did not tell you not to wear a

condom.

Here's what happened, okay? I will

give you a play-by-play of my memory.

I almost had the condom on my dick. It

was on the cusp and then you said,

"Just do it, already."

I didn't mean do it without a condom.

I mean "do it" like "hurry up," like

"get fucking going!"

Well, I assumed you were wearing a

patch, or like a dental dam or one of

those fuckin' butterfly clips or

something like that.

What the hell is a dental dam?

It's like Saran Wrap! It's disgusting,

okay? But I thought you had one. Why

the fuck didn't you stop me once we

started?

Oh, my God! I don't know! I couldn't

tell that you didn't have one on!

Obviously, I was drunk!

Was your vagina drunk? Did you think

it's the thinnest condom on earth I

have on? I'm a fuckin' inventor? I

made a dick-skin condom? He hollowed

out a penis and put it on? What the

fuck?!

You are unbelievable.

Okay, you know what? Maybe, I've

reacted unfavorably. So what happens

now? I don't know how this works.

saying when you're a guy and you have

a family and you have responsibility,

you lose that male camaraderie, and I

get that. I totally understand where

he's coming from.

Why do you guys always go to that

have you had your bloody show?

It's a bloody mucusy discharge. But it

only comes out right before the baby's
