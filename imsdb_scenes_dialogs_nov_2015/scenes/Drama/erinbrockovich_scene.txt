EXT. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SUBURB, MAIN DRAG - DAY

Palms sway ... the sun washes everything in yellow ... cars

motor down either side of the landscaped median ... the calls

of mockingbirds mingle with the BLIP BLIP of car alarms.

ON THE SIDEWALK, a SKATEBOARD CA-LUNKS down the sidewalk,

past the foot traffic of Southern Californians: flip-flops,

Doc Marten's, Rollerblades, Nikes ... then, in the middle of

this pedestrian normalcy, a pair of IMPOSSIBLY HIGH SPIKE-

HEELED PUMPS struts out of a shop.  So high it hurts to look

at them.  As the shoes leave frame, we TILT UP and see

they're leaving a 99-cent store.

As the Pumps turn and head up the street, we see they are

connected to a pair of IMPOSSIBLY LONG, SHAPELY LEGS.

Eveready legs -- they just keep going and going.

They saunter past two BUSINESSMEN on a lunch break.  The men

pause and glance as men tend to when they see a beautiful

woman.  In fact, everyone this woman passes lets their eyes

rest on her a microsecond longer than usual.

- Two SKATEBOARDERS note the STRETCHY MICRO-MINI skimming the

tops of her thighs.

- A MAILMAN spots the BIG, DARK SUNGLASSES tucked into a

MOUNTAIN OF BIG, BLOND HAIR.

- A PRE-TEEN GIRL glimpses the PLUNGING NECKLINE of the

TIGHT, BRIGHT RED MIDRIFF-BARING BUSTIER.

It isn't until she rounds the corner at the end of the block

that we see her entire figure and appreciate why everyone is

so goggle-eyed.  Eye-catching is an understatement.  All

those folks who say Barbie's proportions are unrealistic have

obviously never met ERIN BROCKOVICH.

EXT. AROUND THE CORNER - DAY

A side street.  No pedestrians, just parked cars.  A PARKING

TICKET flaps under the wiper of an old Hyundai.

Even when she talks dirty, there's a heartland goodness to

her voice.  Like Kansas corn fields swaying in the breeze.

As she grabs the ticket from the windshield, her sunglasses

accidentally CLATTER to the ground.

When she picks them up, a fingernail snags on the pavement.

She tends to the nail as she opens her car door and gets in.

WIDER ON THE STREET

The Hyundai starts it up, signals.  Then, just as it pulls

slowly out into the street, a JAGUAR barrels around the

corner, accelerating out of the turn, and rams into the side

of Erin's car, sending it CAREENING into the median.  It

SMASHES into a foot-thick lightpost.  And stops.

EXT. MASRY & VITITOE - DAY

A boring building on a boring block in the Valley, surrounded

by strip malls.  Definitely not where the power lawyers work.

INT. MASRY & VITITOE, RECEPTION - DAY

Generic.  Cottage cheese ceilings, motel art.  A sign over

the reception desk reads: MASRY & VITITOE, ATTORNEYS AT LAW.

ED MASRY, senior partner, slumps by ROSALIND, his chipper

receptionist, with a cup of coffee in his hand.  He's in his

mid-50's, compact and -- even though it's only 9 AM --

already rumpled.

Whatever passion he once had for the personal injury law that

is his career has long since dissipated.  He trundles off

toward his office.

INT. MASRY & VITITOE, OUTSIDE ED'S OFFICE - DAY

Ed's secretary BRENDA -- 50's, jaded, hates her job, but what

can you do? -- is on the phone when Ed rounds the corner.

She puts the call on hold, turns to Ed.

He grabs a gift-wrapped bottle off her desk, reads the card.

Ed peers into his office.  It's a mess -- papers everywhere,

unopened mail.  Standing in the middle of the room is Erin,

in a teensy, leopard-print mini-dress.  As she jiggles a

spike-heeled foot, everything about her shimmies gloriously.

Except her head, which is held in place by a neck brace.

As Ed heads into his office, Brenda picks up the phone.

INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - DAY

Not an office that exudes authority, and Ed's blustery

entrance only adds to the sense of chaos.

He clears a stack of papers off a chair.

Ed gives her a look of pro-forma sympathy.

He takes out a pad and paper, gets ready to write.

INT. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COURTROOM - DAY

Erin is on the stand, wearing the most conservative thing she

owns: a red, form-fitting mini dress, telling her story to

Ed, who's questioning her.

She glances at the defendant's table, where a DOCTOR sits

nobly in surgical scrubs.  His WIFE and two beautiful KIDS

are behind him.  A frigging Norman Rockwell painting.

LATER IN HER TESTIMONY:

STILL LATER:

STILL LATER:

STILL LATER:

INT. COURTROOM - LATER

Erin is still on the stand.  But now the doctor's lawyer is

questioning her.

Erin looks over at the jury.  The personification of

conservative family values.  Oh, shit.

LATER IN HER TESTIMONY:

Erin sees a juror staring judgmentally at her short hem.

Erin gives it a tug, pulling it down a stitch.

Erin sees a few jurors share dubious glances.  Great.

STILL LATER:

The defendant's lawyers is on the offensive.  Erin's starting

to feel the case slipping away.

Ed shakes his head slightly to her -- don't get mad.

Erin sees jurors nodding almost imperceptibly in agreement.

She's on a sinking ship.

INT. COURTHOUSE HALLWAY - DAY

The door to the courtroom flies open and Erin comes out,

furious.  Ed follows her as she heads for the elevator.

Ed notices her ranting is starting to draw attention.

Beat.

Erin turns away from him and heads for the stairway.

EXT. ERIN'S HOUSE - DAY

A shitty little house in a shitty part of Northbridge.  The

Hyundai with a bashed-in side pulls up to the curb.

Erin gets out, takes the mail from her mailbox, then heads

over to the equally grim house next door and rings the bell.

A Hispanic woman in her 60's opens the door, holding a white

baby.  This is MRS. MORALES.

She hands Erin the baby.  It's BETH, Erin's 9-month old.

Erin avoids the question by focusing on her baby.

The truth is too depressing to share.

Oh, God.  In Erin's arms, Beth starts to COUGH.

EXT. ERIN'S HOUSE - DAY

Erin carries Beth up to her house.  As she nears her door,

she steps on a GIANT WATER BUG.  It crunches under her sole.

Insult added to injury.  She heads up to the house, dragging

her shoe, wiping off the bug guts.

INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MAIN LIVING/DINING SPACE - DAY

Just as dull inside.  Salvation Army furniture.  A lot of

beige.  Erin's two older kids, MATTHEW (7) and KATIE (5) are

at the table.  Beth is in a baby seat.  Erin spoons some Mac

& Cheese onto their plates, trying to hide her worry.

Erin switches the plates.

Cause there isn't enough food.

From her baby seat on the table, Beth COUGHS some more.

Thick, sick-sounding coughs.  Erin looks at her.

INT. ERIN'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

The shower and sink are both on full, filling the room with

STEAM.  Erin is seated with COUGHING, CRYING Beth on her lap,

trying to steam the illness out of her.

But her face doesn't look like she believes it.

EXT. DRUGSTORE - DAY

Matt and Katie are messing around with a gumball machine.

INT. DRUGSTORE, AISLE - DAY

Erin is holding Beth, wandering the aisles.  She stops at the

medicines, thinks for a long moment, then, hating herself,

glances to make sure no one's looking, and picks up a bottle.

INT. DRUGSTORE, AT THE REGISTER - DAY

As a CUSTOMER steps away from the register, Erin steps up

with the bottle in her hand and smiles at the CHECK-OUT LADY.

INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY

Erin feeds Beth her medicine, feeling miserable about it.

On the table beside her sit the classifieds.  Row after row

of want ads circled, then X-'d out in red.  A WATER BUG

crawls across the edge of the paper.

INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - DAY

Midday.  Ed enters with a cup of coffee in his hand.  As he

heads to his desk, he trips on a box of files.  Coffee

sloshes out of his cup, onto his shirt.

She pops her head in.

He grabs a tissue, swabs his shirt, then kicks at the box.

As Ed checks his reflection in the glass wall of his office,

he notices, on the other side:

ERIN, standing in the middle of the secretaries' area, in a

miniskirt and leather bustier, talking to MARIO, the firm's

mentally challenged office boy.  Mario heads away from her.

Ed goes to his office door and waves Mario over.

Ed looks back at her -- what the hell?

INT. MASRY & VITITOE, MAIN ROOM - DAY

The support staff -- mostly middle-aged women -- are all

stealing glances at Erin.  Ed comes up to her, all friendly.

Up close, the wear and tear of worry show on her face.

Glances skitter between the secretaries -- get a load of

this.  Ed lowers his voice.

Ed sees everyone watching him, listening.

He starts to escort her out, but she stays put.

She's backing him into a corner here.  He shifts gears.

Ed glances around the room.  Not a whole lot of options here.

He looks back at Erin.

INT. MASRY & VITITOE, FILE ROOM - DAY

A tight office lined with file cabinets and shelves.  ANNA,

the humorless file clerk, is showing Erin around.

Erin shakes her head, no.  Great, thinks Anna.

INT. MASRY & VITITOE, MAIN ROOM - DAY

As Anna shows Erin around the office, they pass JANE, the

bitter office manager, and Brenda, at the coffee area.

INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Ed is packing up his office.  Erin sticks her head in.

He turns, sees her.

Ed looks at her a moment, sees that it's far from okay.

He takes out his wallet, looks in.

He slaps a hundred in her hand and leaves.  When he's gone,

she looks at the bill -- her life raft -- and gives it a

great big kiss.

EXT. BABYSITTER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Erin is at the door, taking Beth from the BABYSITTER, a

shabby, unkempt-looking woman in her 40's.  Katie and Matt

pull on their backpacks and troop out of the sitter's house.

EXT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT

Erin is leaving the store, carrying Beth in one arm and a bag

of groceries in the other.  Katie and Matt are each carrying

a bag of groceries as well.  They are all singing and moving

with the jaunty step of the newly carefree.  Katie spots a

flower display outside the store.

INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MATT AND KATIE'S ROOM - NIGHT

A small room with Salvation Army furniture.  A BUNCH OF

DAISIES is propped in a Ragu jar on Katie's bedside table.

Matt and Katie are asleep in bed.  Erin looks down at them,

smiles, then kisses them good-night.

INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, HALLWAY - NIGHT

Erin comes out of the bedroom and softly closes the door.

But just as the handle clicks into place, the house is filled

with the DEAFENING ROAR of a MOTORCYCLE, REVVING and REVVING.

It sounds as if it's gonna drive through the wall.

EXT. ERIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Erin steps out onto her front stoop and looks over at what

used to be Mrs. Morales's house.  A few MOTORCYCLES are

parked on the lawn; A FEW BIKERS are drinking beer on the

stoop; and one asshole is on his bike, REVVING HIS ENGINE.

But of course he can't hear her.  She walks over to him,

stands right in his line of vision.

He sees her and kills the engine.  Everything about GEORGE

HALABY is tough -- his denim, his leather, his bike, his long

hair.  Everything but his eyes, which twinkle like Santa's.

The guys on the porch chuckle.  Erin turns and starts back to

her house.  George hops off his bike and follows her.

Erin shakes her head in disbelief and keeps walking.

She stops at her porch, turns to him.

She turns and heads inside.  He calls out after her:

INT. MASRY & VITITOE, RECEPTION AREA - DAY

Morning.  Erin walks in, wearing her usual garb.  She passes

the coffee area, where Jane, Brenda, and Anna are milling.

Brenda sees her, gives Anna a nudge.  They both check out her

short hem.  Anna nudges Jane, who looks as well.  Erin

glances over just in time to see all three of them staring at

her judgementally.  She stops in her tracks and stares back.

The women go back to stirring their coffees.  Erin walks on.

INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - DAY

Ed is walking into his office with a coffee cup in his hand

when he trips over the same box of files again.

INT. MASRY & VITITOE, FILE ROOM - DAY

Erin is alone, filing as she talks on the phone.

Ed appears in the door, carrying the box of files.

He plunks the box of files on her desk.  She stares at it,

with no idea of how to go about that.

He sees her staring at the box.

Ed heads out, but pauses before leaving.

INT. MASRY & VITITOE, FILE ROOM - NIGHT

Erin is at her desk, staring bewildered at the files from the

box Ed gave her, which are now spread across her desktop.

She sees Anna packing up her things, to leave.

EXT. ERIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Katie and Matt are running up to the house.  Erin follows,

toting Beth under one arm and the box of documents under the

other.  She steps on another water bug.

As she wipes the bug guts off the bottom of her shoe:

She spots George on his stoop, with a six-pack beside him.

He gets up and follows her to her house.

Erin turns to him.  The kids are waiting at the door.

George reaches out and grabs the box from under her arm.

He's got a point there.  After a beat:

INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

George is on the floor with Matt and Katie, playing War.

Katie points to the Harley emblem on his leather jacket.

Erin comes in from the kitchen.

They get up ...

... and head into bed.  George starts cleaning up the cards.

Erin bends down to help him.

She starts cleaning up the cards.

Erin thinks about the offer.

Tempting.  Erin looks him over.

INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, ERIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

The wee hours.  Erin's in a t-shirt, sitting on her mattress

on the floor.  The paperwork from the box is now spread all

over the floor around her.  She's reading a letter.

CLOSE ON THE LETTER

It's from PG&E, to Donna and Peter Irving.  We see the

phrases, "purchase your house ...", "fair market value ..."

CLOSE ON ANOTHER DOCUMENT

It's a list of comparable house sales in the area.  Owner,

cost; owner, cost.  Every house is in the $65,000 range.

From another room, she hears the sound of BETH CRYING.  Still

reading the file, Erin gets up and goes into:

INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, BETH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Still reading, Erin gets Beth out of her crib.  Beth quiets.

INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, ERIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Erin lies down on the mattress and rests Beth on her chest.

She sets down the file she was reading and picks up another.

CLOSE ON THE FILE

It contains a letter from a Dr. Howard Reeves.  The first

paragraph contains the phrase "... medical examination of

Donna and Peter Irving ..."

Toward the end of the letter, there are two columns.  One is

headed: "IN RANGE".  The other: "OUT OF RANGE".  Under that

head appear the following: "lymphocytes, T-lymphocytes,

natural killer cells, T Helpers, T8 suppresser cells".

Erin stares at it, confused.

INT. MASRY & VITITOE, COFFEE AREA - DAY

Erin is talking to Jane, who's pouring herself coffee.

Erin sees Ed pass behind Jane.  She lowers her voice, so he

won't see her asking for help.

And Jane walks away with her coffee.

EXT. UCLA MAIN LIBRARY - DAY

Large.  Looming.  Very establishment.  Through the windows,

we see Erin at the desk, talking to a LIBRARIAN.  She has the

file in her hands.  Over this:

The librarian gives her directions to somewhere else.

EXT. UCLA MEDICAL LIBRARY - DAY

Smaller, but still establishment.  Erin's Hyundai pulls into

the parking lot.

INT. UCLA MEDICAL LIBRARY - DAY

Erin is at the reference desk, eating a candy bar while she

talks to the LIBRARIAN.  He checks something on the computer.

A couple of WHITE-COATED MEDICAL STUDENTS pass her, double-

taking.  They don't see many like her around here.

INT. UCLA SCIENCE BUILDING, HALLWAY - DAY

A long, academic hallway lit by fluorescents.  Erin gets off

an elevator and heads down the hall.  She finds a door with a

nameplate that reads "Jim Paulsen, Epidemiology" and KNOCKS.

The door opens and DR. JIM PAULSEN appears.  He's a classic

scientist: unruly hair, thick glasses.  Nothing like Erin has

ever shown up at his door.  He reels at the sight of her.

BAXTER, another scientist, leans out of a door down the hall.

Baxter and Erin look at each other.  No recognition, of

course.  Paulsen is immediately embarrassed.

INT. PAULSEN'S OFFICE - DAY

Orderly chaos.  Dr. Paulsen, still recovering, has Erin's

file in his hands.  Erin is sitting across from him.

Wow.  That's more serious than Erin was expecting.

INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY

CLOSE ON THE FILE on the kitchen counter.  The Irvings' phone

number is written on the front.  A PHONE IS RINGING.

WIDEN to see Erin, phone to her ear, grabbing a carton of

juice from Matt and Katie, who are fighting over it at the

table.  Just as she takes it from them, the phone picks up.

BEEP.  Erin thinks a bit, then hangs up and looks at the

file.  Scrawled on the cover is the Irvings' address, in

Hinkley, California.

EXT. L.A. FREEWAY - DAY

The beat-up old Hyundai heads east out of L.A.  DISCO MUSIC

blares from its speakers.

EXT. HINKLEY, CA - DAY

This is a dry, desolate part of California.  No downtown, no

community.  Just tract after tract of arid farmland, with

small, bland, unprotected ranch home cropping up out of the

landscape like occasional tombstones.

A beat-up old sign on the road reads: "HINKLEY, CA.  POP: "

but the  corner where the number would be has broken off.

As a gust of wind lifts dust from the fields, Erin turns onto

Community Boulevard, the main road that cuts through Hinkley.

INT. ERIN'S HYUNDAI - DAY

Erin looks around.  The house she's passing has been razed.

A heap of lumber and wires in the middle of the property.

As she checks the piece of paper with Donna's address, she

drives by the PG&E COMPRESSOR STATION, a massive gray

structure of pipes, chimneys and ladders, set way back from

the road.  Erin passes it without noticing it.

She stops at an intersection.  The house on the corner has

been boarded up with plywood.  Erin notices it -- depressing

-- then turns the corner onto Donna's street.

EXT. DONNA IRVING'S HOUSE - DAY

A generic ranch home standing all alone in the middle of

nothing.  There's a pool out back and a chain link fence

hugging the property.  No landscaping.  Dull, but clean.  A

few BOTTLES OF SPRING WATER wait by the door.

The Hyundai pulls into the driveway and stops.  Erin gets

out.  As she heads up to the door, her spike heels sink into

the dirt.  She rings the bell.  It has a melody chime.

DONNA IRVING opens the door.  She's 35, petite, with a

scrappy, high-strung manner.  She's wearing tight jeans, and

her dark curls are piled on top of her head.

INT. THE IRVINGS' HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY

The house is furnished with little money, but lots of care.

Erin's on a plaid couch, in a sea of needlepoint pillows.

Out back, two GIRLS, ages 9 and 11, are playing in a pool.

She comes out from the kitchen with a tray of iced tea.

Donna corrects the positioning on a couple of pillows.

This would be the perfect opportunity for many to get self-

pitying.  But not Donna.  Life's handed her a shitload of

lemons, and darned if she hasn't made a shitload of lemonade.

Donna tops off their iced teas.

INT. IRVING HOUSE, GARAGE - DAY

CLOSE ON A BOX, with "CHROM INFO" scrawled on it.

WIDEN to see Donna pulling the box down into the room.

She rifles through the box.

She hands Erin a printed fact sheet.  Erin scans it.

INT. ERIN'S CAR - NIGHT

Erin's driving away from Donna's house.  A street lamp throws

light on the box of chromium documents in the passenger seat.

She gets to an intersection and looks across the street at

the massive COMPRESSOR STATION.  Six stories high, lit up

like a Christmas tree, with all sizes of PIPES criss-crossing

the outside and GIANT COOLING TOWERS sticking up out of it.

Far more massive than anything else in town, it looms over

the horizon like the Capitol in D.C. or St. Peter's in Rome.

Erin takes a long look at the compressor station, then turns

onto Community Boulevard and drives away.

INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY

Erin is holding Beth, making her a bottle, when she hears

NOISES coming from outside.  She follows them.

EXT. ERIN'S HOUSE - DAY

Erin opens the door to find George attaching bars to her

windows.

She shakes her head, amused by his persistence.

INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT

George follows Erin in.

Erin pours him some coffee, hands it to him.

George settles in, helps himself to sugar.

George laughs a little at the thought.

But Erin's still mulling it over.

EXT. NORTHRIDGE, ERIN'S BLOCK - DAY

Erin clips down the block in short-shorts and high-heeled

boots.  Up ahead a few of DOWN-ON-THEIR-LUCK MEN are out on a

stoop, drinking their breakfast.  Erin approaches them.

She settles down on the stoop with them for a chat.

INT. PAULSEN'S OFFICE - DAY

Dr. Paulsen and Erin are sitting, talking.  He's thrilled to

have her back in his office.

Erin digs a pad of paper out of her bag.

Paulsen reaches for a notepad, scrawls on it.

INT. UCLA MEDICAL BUILDING, HALLWAY - DAY

Paulsen is seeing Erin out of his office.

EXT. USC CAMPUS - DAY

Erin towers over DAVID FRANKEL as she walks across campus

with him.  He's the grittier variety of scientist: Patagonia,

Birkenstocks, bushy beard.  He's as dry as dust, and as much

as Dr. Paulsen responded to Erin, Frankel barely notices her.

He rattles it off coolly.  Just facts.  Erin's stunned.

His line continues over:

EXT. LAHOTAN REGIONAL WATER BOARD - DAY

Erin's Hyundai pulls up and stops in a cloud of dust.

Erin hops out, checks her reflection in the side-view mirror,

then heads into the building.

INT. LAHOTAN REGIONAL COUNTY WATER BOARD - DAY

Drab, government-issue.  ROSS, the bored desk clerk is

thumbing his way through ROAD & TRACK.  Just as he stops to

stare at a motor oil ad in which a buxom blonde is straddling

the hood of a car, the huge door opens and Erin enters.

Ross looks up.  It's like the girl from the ad walked right

off the page.  He jumps up, to help her with the door.

She smiles.  He can't believe his luck.

He hands her a pen.  He reads over her shoulder as she signs

her name -- Erin Pattee Brockovich.

She smiles and winks at him, then goes around the counter

with him and looks at the stacks and stacks of files.

She heads down an aisle, reading the spines of the files.

They're all town names -- Barstow, Victorville, Oro Grande,

Helendale -- in no particular order.  Finally, Erin spots one

that says Hinkley.  She pulls it down.

IN THE FILE

are pages and pages of Xeroxed memoranda, letters, charts,

graphs, handwritten notes.  All shoved in willy-nilly.

INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MAIN ROOM - DAY

George is watching a football game on TV.  He's just put TV

dinners on the floor in front of the Matt and Katie.

He picks up Matt's chicken, tears it in two ...

... then places the broccoli neatly between the halves.

Katie and Matthew look at it, then up at George, and smile.

This guy just might be all right, after all.

EXT. WATER BOARD - NIGHT

It's gotten dark.  Erin's Hyundai's still there.

INT. WATER BOARD - NIGHT

Erin is on the floor, her legs stretched out in front of her.

She has a bunch of files open and spread across the floor.

The one in her hand has caught her attention.

INSERT ON THE PAPER

It's a memo titled "CLEAN-UP AND ABATEMENT ORDER" from the

water board to PG&E.  Erin is concentrating hard on it,

reading laboriously to herself.

INT. MASRY & VITITOE, RECEPTION - DAY

CLOSE ON A XEROX OF THE ABATEMENT ORDER.  WIDEN to see it is

on top of a stack of papers that Erin is carrying as she

enters the office.  She has an efficient air about her -- a

sense of purpose.

INT. MASRY & VITITOE, FILE ROOM - DAY

Erin swoops in, ready to work, only to find her desk cleared

off.  She turns to Anna, who's already hard at work.

Anna looks up.

But Erin's out the door before Anna can finish her sentence.

INT. MASRY & VITITOE, JANE'S OFFICE - DAY

JANE is at her desk.  Erin barrels in.

Jane reaches under her desk for a box, looks through it.

She hands her the box.  Erin doesn't take it.

INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - DAY

Ed's at his desk, dialing the phone when Erin barrels in.

He sets down the receiver.

Jane follows her in, still carrying the box of stuff.

She turns to Jane, takes her box, and heads out.

And she leaves.

INT. MASRY & VITITOE, OUTSIDE ED'S OFFICE - DAY

As Erin heads for the door, pleased glances fly from

secretary to secretary.  Erin reaches the door, but can't

open it with the box in her arms.  She turns to the room.

EXT. ERIN'S HOUSE - DAY

Erin's Hyundai rumbles to a stop in front of the house.  Erin

shoves open the creaky, reluctant door, lifts her box of

stuff off the seat, and gets out.

As she walks around the car and toward the house, she runs

into the MAILMAN.  He hands her a packet of mail.

Erin looks at the top of the stack.  It's the electric bill.

INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MAIN ROOM - DAY

Erin enters, puts down the box and stares at the mail.

Bills, bills, and more bills.  As she throws them on the

table, she sees George coming out of the kitchen.

She heads into the kitchen, weary and irritated.

INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY

Erin enters, sees all the cleaning stuff from under the sink

is spread around the kitchen floor.  A tool box lies open.

Erin gets down on her knees and starts putting things away.

Before he can finish, a huge WATER BUG runs onto Erin's hand.

She jumps and brushes it off.

She takes off her shoe and smacks at the bug, missing it.

The bug skitters away from her, along the floorboard.  Erin

chases it, smacking at it repeatedly, missing it every time.

But Erin keeps after it, corralling all her frustrations into

killing that one bug.

The bug crawls up onto the table, zipping behind the salt,

the pepper, the napkin holder.  Erin keeps after it, BANGING

the table harder and harder with each SMACK of her shoe.

The salt and pepper skid off the table.  The napkins fly from

their holder.  Just as Erin's about to nail the bug, it slips

into a crack in the wall and disappears.  Erin hurls her shoe

at the crack.  It SMASHES into the wall.

As Erin stands there staring at the wall, her breath starts

to come heavily -- those deep breaths that precede tears.

She slowly slides down into a chair, defeat overcoming her.

She looks around at her for-shit kitchen and starts to cry.

George picks a napkin up off the floor, hands it to her.

He takes a step toward her and kneels in front of her, very

close.  He takes her shoe from her hand and puts it back on

her foot.  Then he takes her hands in his and kisses them.

But he kisses her anyway.  And for the first time in so long,

she feels like something other than a failure.  He pulls her

into him, and she lets herself be pulled.

INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, ERIN'S BEDROOM - DAY

Erin and George are in bed, naked, curled around each other.

He kisses one.

INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - DAY

Ed is at his desk.  The PHONE RINGS.  And RINGS.  And RINGS.

Nothing.  Ed growls in frustration, then gets the phone.

INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY

CLOSE ON THE TABLE, where Beth is bobbing in her baby chair.

On one side of her is a heap of bills with "PAST DUE" and

"PLEASE REMIT" stamped on them.  On the other, the well-

thumbed CLASSIFIED SECTION, with circles and X's all over it.

The DOORBELL rings.  Erin swoops in and picks up Beth.

INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, FRONT DOOR - DAY

Erin carries Beth over to the front door, spies through the

peephole, and sees Ed standing there.  She opens the door.

Ed takes a beat, copping to the charge.

He glares at her.  Realizes he has no choice.

INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - LATER

Erin has let Ed in.  They're sitting.

Ed thinks for a moment.

Before getting it for him, she looks at him, weighs her odds.

Erin doesn't budge.

She goes to her box of stuff from the office and digs out the

document for him.  He scans it.

EXT. 10 FREEWAY - DAY

Erin's Hyundai zips along the freeway.  "Funky Town" is

blaring from the tinny stereo.  Over it:

INT. HYUNDAI - DAY

Erin's driving.  Matthew's in the front seat.  Katie and Beth

(in a car seat) are in the back.

She glances at them, frowns a little.

Katie smiles a little.  She likes this side of her mom.

By now they're all smiling.  Funky Town plays on.

EXT. PG&E COMPRESSOR STATION - DAY

The Hyundai is parked at the entrance to the station, by a

row of dead trees.  Erin is standing beside a sign that says

"Private Property.  No Trespassing", taking pictures of the

massive structure in the distance.  Matthew, Katie, and Beth

are drawing in the dirt with sticks.

She wanders up the drive, onto PG&E property, moving around

the plant, taking pictures of it from every possible angle.

As she wanders over a big, flat, dry field to the side of the

plant, she glances over her shoulder to check on her kids and

notices the trail she made in the dirt has a greenish hue.

She looks at the dirt right her feet.  Kicks the ground.

Below the surface, the dirt turns from brown to green.  Erin

notes this, then looks back at her kids playing in the dirt.

Worry comes over her face.  She heads back to them.

EXT. HINKLEY MART - DAY

The kids are waiting at the car.  Erin comes out of the store

with a bottle of water and uses it to rinse off their hands.

EXT. WATER BOARD - DAY

The sound of a BABY CRYING.  The Hyundai's parked in front.

INT. WATER BOARD - DAY

Erin is at the Xerox machine, copying a file while she tries

to calm Beth.  There's a stack of files on the nearby table.

Matthew and Katie are flopping around on the floor.

Whining, fussing.  Ross goes over to her.

She hands Ross the STACK OF DOCUMENTS.

INT. MASRY & VITITOE, BRENDA'S DESK - DAY

Ed comes in in the morning, and without pausing, hands Brenda

a copy of the STACK OF DOCUMENTS, with a Post-it on the top.

He continues into his office and closes the door.

CLOSE ON THE FAX MACHINE LED

Brenda types in the number.  The recipient's I.D. comes up on

the LED: PG&E CLAIMS DEPT.

INT. IRVING HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY

Another copy of those DOCUMENTS, now in Donna's hands.  She's

on her couch with Erin, reading them.  Outside, Donna's two

daughters are playing in the pool.  She reads the last page

and looks up at Erin, bewildered.

Donna resists this idea hard.

Donna sits quietly, trying to make sense of this.  The only

sound is the LAUGHING and SPLASHING from the pool out back.

Then, gradually, Donna realizes what it is she's hearing --

her kids playing in toxic water.  She jumps up ...

... and runs out to the pool.  Erin follows her.

EXT. DONNA'S HOUSE - DAY

From the door, Erin watches Donna run to the edge of the pool

in a frantic response to this news.

Erin watches compassionately as Donna flails to get her kids

out of the contaminated water.

INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - DAY

It's morning.  Ed is checking the lie of his tie in his

reflection in the window.  Erin is on his couch, high-heeled

legs stretched out in front of her.

INT. MASRY & VITITOE, BRENDA'S DESK - CONTINUOUS

Jane is delivering paychecks.  When Brenda gets to her desk,

Jane tips her head toward Ed's office, as if to say, check it

out.  Brenda peers in and sees Erin.

Brenda's stunned.  Takes a beat.  Makes assumptions.

INT. ED'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Ed is still checking his reflection.

Brenda pops her head in, ignores Erin.

Erin feels the chill Brenda's sending her way.

Brenda leaves without acknowledging Erin.

INT. MASRY & VITITOE, MAIN ROOM - DAY

Ed and Erin come out and see DAVID BAUM waiting at reception.

Forget law school, this kid looks like he's just out of

twelfth grade.  Not a hair on his chin.  His suit and shoes

look brand new.

INT. MASRY & VITITOE, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Ed and Erin are seated across the table from Baum. To say

this kid lacks authority is a gross understatement.  He

doesn't talk; he squeaks.

Ed laughs a little in disbelief.

Ed shoves them across the table.  Baum doesn't look at them.

He stalls a moment.  Erin jumps in.

Despite their persuasiveness, Baum parrots what is obviously

the party line:

Ed looks across at this pissant little kid.

As Ed starts out:

And Ed leaves the conference room.  Erin follows him out.

INT. MASRY & VITITOE, MAIN ROOM - DAY

Erin follows Ed as he stomps back to his office.

Behind them, Baum steps out of the conference room.

Ed turns and looks at him.  He gets a tiny smile.

Baum heads out to the reception area.

She watches him go into his office, impressed.  Big smile.

INT. MASRY & VITITOE, OUTSIDE ED'S OFFICE - NIGHT

End of the day.  Most everyone has left.  Erin is at her new

work space near Ed's office.  She's poring over a fat file of

documents.  ROSALIND wanders by with her coat on.

Rosalind turns on Erin's desk lamp and heads out.

Outside the big glass office doors, Rosalind stops to talk to

a lost-looking COUPLE IN THEIR MID-30's.  These are MANDY and

TOM BROWN.  He's a security guard uniform, with an envelope

under his arm.  Rosalind points to Erin.  The Browns enter

the office and approach her.

INT. ERIN'S DESK - LATER

CLOSE ON photos of chickens, each with a twisted, limp neck.

WIDEN to see Erin looking at them with Tom and Mandy.

She tucks them into a file, as if that's it.

INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MATT AND KATIE'S ROOM - NIGHT

Matt and Katie are in bed, with the light off.  Erin comes

in, quietly, in clothes from work.

CLOSE ON MATT AND KATIE.  They're awake and pissed.

They still don't answer.  She comes in and sits on a bed.

He's got a point there.  Erin feels like shit.

INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - NIGHT

The room is dark.  Erin enters and flops down onto the bed,

exhausted.  George is lying on the bed next to her.

EXT. ROUTE 10, INLAND EMPIRE - DAY

Dry, flat California.  Ed's big old Mercedes is toodling down

the freeway, at an overly safe, almost-geriatric speed.

INT. ED'S MERCEDES - DAY

Frank Sinatra is playing on the stereo.  Ed is swaying in

time.  This is his kind of music.  He smiles, looks at Erin.

Whatever.  Erin glances at the speedometer.  Oy.  So slow.

His car phone rings.  He picks it up.

He starts swerving across the lane markers.  THWACK THWACK

THWACK.  Ed doesn't notice.  Erin's getting nervous.

He kisses into the phone.  Swerves.  A car barely misses

them.  Erin's eyes widen.  Not fun at all.

He finally hangs up, smiling to himself.  Erin clears her

throat.

EXT. FREEWAY - DAY

The Mercedes pulls to a stop on the shoulder.  Erin gets out,

walks around to the driver's side.  Opens the door.

He moves over.  She gets in, turns off the Sinatra.  They

pull back out onto the freeway in silence.

EXT. MANDY BROWN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The Mercedes and a truck are parked out front.

INT. DONNA IRVING'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Donna and Pete Irving, and Mandy and Roy Brown are all

seated, sipping iced tea.  While they talk, Erin hands them

all information packets on chromium.  Ed is standing in front

of them, a little stiff.

Roy looks up from his retainer agreement.

Erin watches them look around at each other, stunned by the

figure.

Erin's enjoying Ed's discomfort almost too much to stop.  But

just almost.  She shifts gears.

They look at Ed.  Well?

When they hear this, and realize he's in it with them, they

all reach for their pens and sign.   They hand the agreements

over to Erin, who takes them across the room to Ed.  He

stuffs them in his briefcase and closes it up.  That's that.

Boy.  Cold as ice.  Erin stares at him, stunned by his

brusque manner, then leans in to him, close.

She gives him a stern look, then turns toward the women.

She picks up a tray of iced tea and cookies and heads to the

kitchen.  Donna and Mandy follow, leaving Ed alone with Pete

and Roy.  He stands there, awkwardly.  Then, finally:

INT. DONNA'S KITCHEN - DAY

Erin and Donna are putting away the cleaned glasses.  Mandy

is scanning the chromium pamphlet Erin gave her.

Erin listens, interested.

EXT. LINWOOD DAIRY, BARN - DAY

Another day.  BOB LINWOOD, 40's and gruff, is in the barn,

tossing hay around.

He sees Erin picking her way toward him in her high-heels.

She steps in a cow patty.  Laughs at herself good-naturedly.

EXT. THE DESOTOS' HOUSE - DAY

CLOSE ON A SIGN that reads: THE DESOTOS, hanging on the side

of a small, paint-chipped house.  Erin is at the door talking

to MARY DESOTO, 65, who's wearing a big cross at her breast.

INT. LAURA AND MIKE AMBROSINO'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Erin is talking to MIKE and LAURA AMBROSINO -- 30's.  Solid,

family folks.  But Laura's left brow and cheekbone look

swollen and misshapen, and she's trying to hide the fact that

she's in a lot of pain.

INT. RITA AND TED DANIELS' HOUSE - DAY

Erin is talking to TED AND RITA DANIELS.  Their daughter

ANNABELLE, 10, is sitting on the couch, wrapped in a blanket.

Annabelle smiles a little.

INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, ERIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Late night.  George rolls over -- Erin's side of the bed is

empty.  He checks the clock, then gets up and heads into:

INT. ERIN'S APARTMENT, HALLWAY - NIGHT

He peers around and spots her, sitting in the little kid's

chair in Matthew and Katie's room.

Erin is holding Beth, watching Matt and Katie sleep.  Erin

hears the floor creak as George steps into the doorway.

EXT. VALLEY SIDEWALK - DAY

Ed and Erin are walking down the street, take-out coffee cups

in their hands.  Ed is sipping his, but Erin is in too much

of a lather to drink hers.

They go into their office building.

INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

Erin and Ed are riding up.

The doors open.  Ed gets off.  Erin follows.

INT. MASRY LAW OFFICE BUILDING, HALLWAY - DAY

Erin's dogging Ed down the hall, to the office.

He gets to the Masry & Vititoe doors.  Opens them.

INT. MASRY & VITITOE - DAY

Erin tails Ed back to his office.

He shuts his office door on her.

INT. ED'S OFFICE - DAY

Ed goes over to his desk, sits down.  He sees a stack of

messages there, starts flipping through them.  Then he stops.

He shoves the messages aside and puts his head in his hands.

He sits like that for a moment, GROANS to himself.  Then he

pushes himself up and heads over to his door.

When he opens it, he finds Erin still standing there, exactly

where he left her, arms crossed.  She hasn't budged.

Ed pauses, groans again, realizing what decision he's making.

She smiles victoriously.

He heads back to his desk.  Erin follows him into his office.

He gives her a look.  Knows what's coming.

INT. TOYS 'R' US - DAY

CLOSE ON A BEEPING CEL PHONE

as Erin tries to program numbers into its speed dial.  WIDEN

to see she is reading from the phone's manual as she enters

Toys 'R' Us with George, Matthew, Katie and Beth.

Matthew and Katie fan out into the store.  Erin keeps messing

with the phone.

Erin looks over at him, weary.

And she walks away from him.

EXT. HINKLEY, ROADSIDE DITCH - DAY

Erin, in high heels and miniskirt, is straddling a ditch,

scooping clumps of gunky moss from the ditch into plastic

containers.  Over this:

As Erin labels the containers, her heels slide down the side

of the ditch, and she lands smack in it, knee-deep in gunk.

EXT. HINKLEY, COMMUNITY BOULEVARD - NIGHT

Erin, now completely dirty, is climbing over a fence marked

"No Trespassing".  Her arms are full of more containers.

She adds them to a growing collection of containers in the

trunk of her car.

EXT. HINKLEY, THE POOL BEHIND AN ABANDONED HOUSE - DAY

Another day.  This time it's RAINING.  Erin minces her way

down to the deep end of the pool in her spike heels.

She gets to the deep end and scoops up a Ziploc full of

rancid pool water and seals it.

Erin spots a few dead frogs in the water.  She picks one up

by the leg, and seals it in a plastic bag as well.

EXT. WELL - DAY

With a sample cup held in her teeth, Erin hauls herself up

over the well's concrete wall, then, with her back against

one side of the well and her feet against the other, starts

shimmying down the well.

INSIDE THE WELL

she winces at the algae and gook that's clinging to her as

she descends to the water level.  When she's low enough, she

takes the sample cup from her teeth and scoops up the water.

INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ERIN'S DESK - DAY

Erin's at her desk, bending over her notebook in a miniskirt,

adding reports to the TOXICOLOGY binder.

ON THE REPORTS: We catch a few words: "water sample A ...",

"soil sample D ...", "frog sample A ...", "... traces of

hexavalent ..."

Brenda looks at Erin and sees her hem rising in the back.

Erin turns to Brenda, relishing the chance to irritate her.

Ed, in his office, laughs.  He's starting to like this gal.

INT. ERIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

It's a hot night.  George is playing on the floor with the

kids.  Erin is behind them on the couch, laboriously reading

a book labeled, simply, CHROMIUM.  The phone RINGS.  Erin

picks it up.

His voice is flat, creepy.  Not friendly.

CLICK.  Erin stares at the phone, freaked.

INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

George watches Erin double-checking the locks on the door.

She goes to the living room, double-checks the window locks

in there.  George follows.

She heads into the bedrooms.

George reacts, a little stung.  He follows her into:

INT. MATT AND KATIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Matt and Katie are asleep.  Erin is checking their windows.

George comes in.  They whisper.

She gives him a glare, then leaves the room.

INT. WATER BOARD - DAY

Erin is reaching up to a high shelf for a dusty old box of

files.  Out of the corner of her eye, she sees Ross passing.

Ross is speechless.  He just stands there.  Erin drags the

box to the floor and goes to work.

EXT. WATER BOARD - NIGHT

Erin's car is parked in front.  A DIRTY OLD PICK-UP comes

rumbling up the road.  When its lights hit Erin's car, it

slows, then pulls over.  The driver flicks on his BRIGHTS to

get a better look at the car.  The truck sits there for a

bit, a dark presence.  Then, as the headlights of another car

appear down the road, the truck goes back in gear, pulls out

and drives off.

INT. ERIN'S HYUNDAI - NIGHT

A pile of documents is strapped into the passenger seat.  An

empty coffee cup rolls around the floor.  Erin's driving,

exhausted.  She yawns as she dials her phone.

INTERCUT between Erin in her car, and George in bed.

Erin says nothing, just stares out at the empty highway,

feeling all hollowed-out.

Erin just nods.  Keeps staring straight ahead as a tear rolls

down her cheek.

INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ERIN AND BRENDA'S AREA - DAY

CLOSE ON SOME FILES as Erin hands them to Ed.  As he takes

them from her, he notices a crematory urn on Erin's desk.

Ed laughs and hands the documents to Brenda without looking

at her.  She grumpily takes them over to the fax machine.

CLOSE ON THE FAX LED as Brenda types in the number. The

recipient's name comes up again: PG&E CLAIMS DEPT.

EXT. HINKLEY BARBECUE - DAY

Open pits, pony rides, watermelon.  George is watching Katie

and Matt being led around on ponies, an activity that stopped

being fun hours ago.  Now they're just hot and tired.

BY THE BARBECUE, Ed is talking to an OLDER COUPLE as they

sign retainer agreements.

ELSEWHERE, Erin, holding Beth, is looking at pictures of a

swimming pool with FIVE OTHER WOMEN.  The water is green.

LATER ...

Erin's trunk is open.  She and Ed are clipping new clusters

of retainer agreements into the "PLAINTIFFS" binder.

LATER STILL ...

Erin and Ed are passing out informational pamphlets.  She

sticks one in a hand before noticing that it's George's.

George drops the pamphlet and takes Beth from Erin.  He heads

over to Matt and Katie, sitting glumly on a log.

As he steps away, a hand reaches down and grabs the flier he

dropped.  It belongs to a MAN IN A BLACK JACKET.  He's in his

50's, strong and sinewy.  Military-style dark glasses obscure

his eyes.  He scans the pamphlet, then watches Erin working

the crowd.  Watches her carefully.  He slides the pamphlet

into his inside pocket, and heads back his car -- the DIRTY

OLD PICK-UP TRUCK that idled in front of the Water Board.

LATER STILL ...

Erin is heading over to George and the kids, ready to leave,

when Donna comes up to her, with A MIDDLE-AGED MAN in tow.

Erin stops in her tracks, very interested.

LATER STILL ...

Erin and Frank are on a bench, talking.  Out of the corner of

her eye, she sees her car drive off.  George's hand sticks

out the driver's side and flips her the bird.  She watches

him disappear, then, hiding her rage, turns back to Frank.

LATER ...

The barbecue is winding down.  Ed is heading for his

Mercedes.  Erin storms up beside him, mad as all get-out.

INT. ED'S CAR - DAY

Ed is driving.  He glances over at Erin, fuming in the

passenger seat.  After a beat:

Another beat.  Then Erin's cel phone rings.  She digs into

her bag, pulling it out as fast as she can.  Answers.

There's a pause.  Then Mike Ambrosino's voice comes over the

line, very strained:

EXT. AMBROSINOS' HOUSE, FOYER - DAY

The curtains are drawn; everything is dark.  Ed and Erin are

at the door, talking to Mike, who looks drawn and tired.

He shows them a bottle of prescription pills.

Erin nods, then leaves Ed with Mike and heads toward:

INT. AMBROSINOS' HOUSE, BEDROOM - DAY

Erin opens the door.  Very dark, very quiet.  Laura is lying

in bed.  Erin goes over to her.  They speak in whispers.

Erin sits down on the chair next to the bed.  Takes a beat.

Laura shakes her head.

Erin watches her sadly.

INT. PG&E COMPRESSOR STATION - DAY

A LOUD, industrial plant.  Erin and Frank Melendez walk

through, him in coveralls, her in a teensy sun dress.  Both

in hard-hats.  He's giving her a tour.

EXT. NORTHRIDGE STREET - DAY

George, in his leather and denim, is walking down the

sidewalk.  As we WIDEN, we see he's pushing a PINK STROLLER.

He stops at a crosswalk, waiting for the light to change.

In the stroller, Beth starts to whine.  George reaches in his

pocket, finds her pacifier.  As he's leaning down to give it

to her, he hears a RUMBLE coming down the street behind him.

The roar grows.  He stands, looks.  A GROUP OF ABOUT TEN

BIKERS has pulled up next to him.  He looks at them.  They

look at him, then at the stroller.  George feels ridiculous.

When the light changes, the bikers REV LOUDLY and pull out.

George just stands there and watches them go.

INT. MASRY & VITITOE - NIGHT

His office is all about Hinkley.  A map of the plume area and

a diagram of the plant cover one wall; photos of the plant

cover the credenza; piles of documents litter every surface;

Erin is up at the map, eating Chinese food.

She bites into a forkful of food, keeps talking.

She reaches for a document, reads from it.

In response to the insinuation, Erin gives him a glare.

Suddenly, her eyes pop out of her head --

Tears spring to her eyes.  She fans furiously at her mouth.

Ed finds the tequila from the client and hands it to her.

She takes a swig.  There's a nanosecond of relief ... until

the tequila hits.  Her eyes redden.  She spews and gasps.

Ed chuckles.

INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - LATER

The tequila's been dipped into.  Ed and Erin are each lying

on a couch, staring at documents.  Late-night working.

He gets up, grabs his trash can, and moves around the room

with it, cleaning up all the Chinese food cartons.

She doesn't have one.

Beat.  Ed smiles.

He gives her a long look.

They both smile a little awkwardly.  Take a beat.  Then:

INT. MASRY & VITITOE - NIGHT

The Christmas party.  The office is decorated; someone is

Santa.  Erin and George enter, all dressed up.

INT. MASRY & VITITOE, HALLWAY - NIGHT

Erin's giving George a guided tour.  As they head down the

hall, every desk is decorated and has a present on it

INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ERIN AND BRENDA'S DESKS - NIGHT

It's dark.  The door to Erin's area opens.

She flicks on the lights.  Brenda's desk is decorated and as

a present on it.  Erin's is empty.

Erin shakes her head.  She's surprised by how hurt she is.

George looks over at her, sees her eyes glisten a little.  He

goes over to her, wraps his arms around her.

He kisses her.  She leans into him.  He kisses her some more.

She kisses back.  She's gonna let him take care of her.  Some

more kisses, heating up.  He slides her onto her empty desk.

She laughs a little.  He slides his hands up her skirt.  She

pulls him into her, tugging his shirt out of his pants.

INT. MASRY OFFICES, HALLWAY - NIGHT

Ed is coming down the hall with his wife, JOEY.  Joey is much

younger than Ed, and very pretty.

INT. ERIN'S DESK - NIGHT

Erin and George, in a rapidly-heating-up clinch on her desk,

hear the voices.  Erin pulls away.

He pulls her back into him, not wanting to move.

But Erin pulls away ...

He watches her straighten her dress and take a step away from

him.  It's just one step, but it feels a hell a lot farther.

INT. RECEPTION AREA - LATER

Erin and Ed are at the reception desk, talking and laughing.

NEARBY, Joey and George are standing together, awkwardly.

INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MATT AND KATIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Matthew lies awake in his bed, listening to George and Erin

fight.

INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, ERIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Erin and George are fighting while they get ready for bed.

The fight is interrupted by the sound of BETH CRYING.

She leaves the room.

INT. BETH'S ROOM - NIGHT

Beth is wailing in her crib.  Erin comes in in her nightshirt

and lifts Beth out.  Then, more to herself than to Beth:

She runs her hand over Beth's head, then slides down the wall

and crumples onto the floor.  As she curls around Beth, Erin

starts to COUGH.  Deep, raspy coughs from way down low.

EXT. PG&E STATION - NIGHT

Late, late at night.  The plant is silent.  The property

seems empty, until we notice Pete Irving standing alone

inside the gates, staring up at the station.

After a beat, he picks up a rock and hurls it at the plant.

It misses.  Not that it would do anything if it hit.  He

reaches for another, throws it.  Then another, and another.

He hurls rock after rock at the gigantic plant.  Then,

overwhelmed by his impotence, he lets out a TERRIFYING YELL.

INT. IRVINGS' HOUSE, DONNA'S BEDROOM - DAY

Donna's sitting quietly in bed.  Erin is sitting on the edge

of the bed.

She looks down her shirt front.

Donna smiles a little.  Then her face crumbles.

INT. MASRY & VITITOE, DAY

CLOSE ON THE FAX LED

as DOCUMENTS are faxed once again to the PG&E CLAIMS DEPT.

THEN AGAIN, on another day.

AND AGAIN, on another day.

INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - DAY

Ed is once again checking the lie of his tie in a window.

Erin is popping some aspirin, trying to kill a headache that

has brought with it a healthy dose of intolerance.

Brenda leans her head in.

INT. MASRY & VITITOE, RECEPTION AREA - DAY

Talk about moving up the food chain.  MS. SANCHEZ, MR.

WEBSTER, MR. BUDA, and MR. COOPER mill slowly about the

reception area like sharks.  They all ooze importance.

INT. MASRY & VITITOE, OUTSIDE OF ED'S OFFICE - DAY

Erin, Ed and Brenda are staring out at them.

INT. MASRY & VITITOE, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Sanchez, Webster, Buda, and Cooper are seated.

The door opens and Ed enters, legal pad under his arm.

Followed by Erin, legal pad under her arm.  Followed by Anna

(looking professional in Brenda's suit coat), legal pad under

her arm.  Followed by Mario (in a suit produced from who

knows where), legal pad under his arm.  If you didn't know

better, you'd assume it was a team of lawyers as well.

Ed and Erin sit down and get to work.  Mario and Anna,

clearly told to just follow along, sit down a moment later.

INT. MASRY & VITITOE, CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

Mario and Anna are sitting mutely in their seats beside Ed

and Erin, firing blank looks across the table.

Erin has no patience for this today.

Mario and Anna exchange a look.  This is getting interesting.

But there's no stopping her.

And she gets up and storms out of the meeting.

INT. MASRY & VITITOE, COFFEE AREA - DAY

Erin drinks a big swig of coffee and pops a few more aspirin.

Beyond her, the PG&E lawyers are filing out of the office.

Anna wanders over to Erin, a little uncomfortable.

INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ERIN'S DESK - NIGHT

Erin's at her desk, which is completely buried in documents

and files.  She's visibly exhausted, struggling to focus on

the page, and COUGHING while she works.  Ed calls to her.

EXT. HINKLEY GAS STATION - SUNSET

Erin is sitting out front, swigging cough syrup from the

bottle.  She checks her watch: 6:30.  The GAS STATION

ATTENDANT comes out, locks up, and turns out the lights.

He gets in his car and drives off.  Erin sits down again.

Looks down the road in both directions.  Nothing.

Then she spots, behind some bushes across the street, a glint

of chrome.  She shields her eyes against the sunset and sees:

the BEAT-UP TRUCK parked behind some shrubbery.

Erin looks around, realizes she's alone.  As she looks back

at the truck, the ASH of a cigarette brightens in the cab.

She realizes she's being watched.  The driver's door opens.

Erin bolts for her car, scrambling to find her keys.  She

jumps in, locks her doors, and tries to start her car, but it

won't turn over.  Panic.  The Man in the Dark Glasses has

gotten out and is heading toward her car. Erin looks around

again.  Not a soul.  She tries the engine again.  And again.

Just as he gets to her car, the engine engages.  Erin peels

out of the gas station.

INT. ERIN'S CAR - NIGHT

Erin drives down the road, hyperventilating, trying to focus

on the road.  She looks in the rear-view mirror -- nothing.

She reaches the train tracks.  A train is passing.  She has

to stop.  As she's waiting, the glint of headlights bounce

off her rear view mirror.  Truck lights, coming her way.

Fuck.  She looks at the train -- still passing -- then back

at the headlights closing in on her.  The train, the

headlights, the train, the headlights ...

Finally, when the headlights are right behind her, the last

train car zips by.  Erin peels out, bounding her rickety car

over the tracks.  The truck follows.

EXT. HINKLEY ROAD - NIGHT

The Hyundai zips down the road.  And behind it, the truck.

INT. HYUNDAI - NIGHT

She looks out at the landscape around her.  It's black.  No

other cars on the road.  She starts to panic, accelerates.

EXT. HINKLEY ROAD - NIGHT

The Hyundai going faster.  The truck still following.

INT. HYUNDAI - NIGHT

Erin comes up on a stop sign.  She runs it.  So does the

truck.   A little later, she makes a turn and sees THE LOST

CAUSE SALOON.  In the parking lot, like a lifeboat, sits Ed's

Mercedes.  She pulls into the drive and jumps out of her car.

INT. LOST CAUSE SALOON - NIGHT

Ed is eating ribs when Erin bursts through the door.  She

rushes over to him, near tears with fear and exhaustion.

Ed gets up and heads toward the door.

As Ed looks out the door, Erin collapses onto a bench.

Ed looks at her.  She looks terrible.  Shaky, tired, drawn.

EXT. HINKLEY MOTEL - NIGHT

Crappy and pink.  Ed's Mercedes pulls into the parking lot.

Erin's Hyundai follows.  Ed stops, gets out.

INT. HYUNDAI - NIGHT

Ed swings by Erin's open car window.

EXT. HINKLEY MOTEL - NIGHT

Erin and Ed amble down the porch, checking door numbers, each

rattling a key.  They find their adjacent rooms and stop.

Erin leans against the wall, too weak to stand.

She nods a little.  Then before she goes into her room:

It's as tender as she gets, and he's moved by it.  They look

at each other.  Maybe even considering.  But after a long

beat, she reaches for her door again.  Moment over.

She smiles, goes inside.  He watches her close her door

behind her before going inside himself.

EXT. ERIN'S HOUSE, FRONT STOOP - NIGHT

George is sitting alone on the stoop, drinking a beer.  Music

is coming from his house next door.  He stares out into the

street with a lot on his mind.

INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY

Katie and Matt are making a mess of breakfast.  Beth is on

the floor, grinding cereal into the linoleum.

Erin enters, having just gotten home, and sees the mayhem.

She heads out.

INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, ERIN'S BEDROOM - DAY

George is sitting on the bed when Erin enters.

He doesn't answer.  Doesn't move.  She notices this.

He's very calm.  He holds out a small jewelry box.

He nods, then stands, to leave.

Only then does she see the packed duffel bag in the corner.

He picks it up and walks out the door, tossing the earring

box on the bed as he goes.

INT. ERIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Erin is at her window, looking out at the street below.

George is strapping a couple of bags onto the back of his

bike.  He gets on the bike, starts it up, and drives away.

INT. HYUNDAI - DAY

Erin is driving, looking weary.  Her kids are in the car.

Matthew turns on the radio.  Erin reaches over and turns it

off.  Matthew turns it back on.  Erin glares at him, turns it

off.  On/off/on/off.  A test of wills.  Finally, when Matthew

turns it on one more time, Erin turns it off, yanks the knob

off the stereo and throws it out the window.

EXT. MASRY & VITITOE PARKING LOT - DAY

The Hyundai pulls into the lot.

INT. HYUNDAI - DAY

Erin parks the car, unclips her seat belt.

She gets out.

INT. MASRY & VITITOE, MAIN ROOM - DAY

Business as usual.  Erin comes in, goes straight to her desk.

INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ERIN'S DESK - DAY

Erin flips through her "in" box, looking for something in

particular.  Doesn't find it.  Grrr.  She heads off to:

INT. MASRY & VITITOE, JANE'S OFFICE - DAY

Jane is at her desk when Erin comes in.

Erin glares at her ...

... then turns and storms out of Jane's office.

INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - DAY

Ed is on the phone when Erin barges in, rage in her eyes.

Clearly, she's in a dander he's going to have to deal with.

Ed sighs.  Realizes he's going to have to take this on.

She storms out.

INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT

Erin is standing at the sink, visibly exhausted, trying to do

the dinner dishes with one arm and comfort Beth, who's

CRYING, with the other.  Matthew comes in.

The DOORBELL RINGS.  Erin goes to get it.  Matthew follows

INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

Matthew is dogging Erin on this.  Beth is still crying.

Erin opens the door.  A MESSENGER is there.

He hands her a manila envelope.  She signs for the package,

then tears into it as the Messenger heads away.

A CHECK and a SET OF KEYS fall out.  She looks at the check.

It's made out for $5,000.  A note attached reads "HIRE A

NANNY. AND LOOK OUTSIDE. - E."

Erin looks up and sees A BRAND-NEW CHEVY BLAZER parked on the

curb.  She looks at the keys in her hand.  Chevy keys.  Whoa.

EXT. MASRY & VITITOE, PARKING LOT - DAY

Erin drives up in the Blazer, pulls into a parking space.

INT. MASRY & VITITOE, LAW LIBRARY - DAY

It's dark.  Ed's seated at a table, alone.  Erin walks by the

door, then spots him and stops in the doorway.

Ed turns, sees her.

She sits, reading him.

Beat.

He nods to himself, and looks up at her, his mind made up.

INT. ERIN'S NEW CAR - DAY

It's raining.  They're driving through the tall buildings of

Century City.  Ed is full of nervous excitement.

INT. POTTER, HUGHES & ROSEWOOD, RECEPTION - DAY

It feels more like the lobby of a five-star hotel than an

office.  Erin and Ed step off the elevator.  Erin gawks.

As Ed turns to check his reflection, a YOUNG LAWYER comes

through the reception area.  Erin watches him pass, then,

still miffed, calls out to him.

The lawyer double-takes on her, then retreats into the

office.  Erin turns to Ed, smiles.

INT. POTTER, HUGHES & ROSEWOOD RECEPTION AREA - DAY

THERESA DELLAVALLE, 38, junior partner, comes out to greet

them.  She's everything Erin isn't: conservative, restrained,

unemotional.  And about as sexy as a station wagon.

INT. POTTER, HUGHES & ROSEWOOD HALLWAY - DAY

Theresa leads Ed and Erin down a long hall of teak desks.

The sound of their footfalls is swallowed up by the plush

carpeting.  Occasional ATTORNEYS and PARALEGALS glance at

Erin.  She feels their stares.

INT. POTTER, HUGHES & ROSEWOOD, KURT POTTER'S OFFICE - DAY

Potter is sitting behind his giant desk when Theresa leads Ed

and Erin in.

Erin gives Ed another look.  What the fuck?  Ed gives her a

firm look back.  Behave.

INT. POTTER, HUGHES & ROSEWOOD, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Potter, Ed, Erin, Theresa and few  PARALEGALS are sitting

around the table.  As the conversation ping-pongs between Ed

and Potter, Potter completely ignores Erin.

Erin's starting to steam at Potter.  Theresa sees it brewing,

tries to intercede.

Erin notices all her files in stacks against the wall.

Okay, these people are starting to piss her off.

Erin just stares at her.  Theresa sighs, reluctantly glances

down at a file.

As Theresa starts to write it down:

Beat.  Erin glares at Theresa, indignant.

INT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

It's still raining.  Erin is following Ed to the car.  He's

furious.

Ed stops in his tracks, furious.  He glares at her.

On that, he gets in his car, slams the door, and drives off,

leaving her standing alone in the pouring rain.

INT. POTTER, HUGHES & ROSEWOOD, HALLWAY - DAY

Potter and Ed are walking down the hallway, mid-conversation.

A FEW PARALEGALS follow them with files.

EXT. LINWOOD'S DAIRY - DAY

Bob Linwood is in his barn, mucking it out.  Theresa is at

the edge of the property, trying unsuccessfully to get his

attention by yelling and waving her arms.  In her expensive

shoes, she's stopped short of the cow patty minefield.

INT. POTTER, HUGHES & ROSEWOOD, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

CLOSE ON A CLIENT FILE as a hand fills in a phone number.

WIDEN TO SEE Erin seated with a PARALEGAL, rattling off facts

and numbers from memory.  She's seized by a COUGHING FIT.

EXT. LINWOOD DAIRY - DAY

Theresa still hasn't gotten Linwood's attention.  Finally,

rather than ruin her shoes, she picks up a stone and tosses

it at the barn.  It hits the window and BREAKS IT.

INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ERIN AND BRENDA'S DESKS - DAY

Erin's desk is empty: no Erin, no files, nothing.  Ed comes

out of his office and hands Brenda a STACK OF DOCUMENTS.

CLOSE ON THE FAX LED

Brenda types in the number.  The recipient's I.D. comes up

again, only this time it says: POTTER, HUGHES, ROSEWOOD.

INT. POTTER, HUGHES, ROSEWOOD, HALLWAY - ANOTHER DAY

A SECRETARY carries the documents to Potter's office.  On the

way, she passes THE CONFERENCE ROOM.  Inside, Erin is still

dictating to the PARALEGAL.  She's shivery with fever now.

The floor around her is littered with tissues.

INT. DANIELS' HOUSE - DAY

Theresa is talking to Rita and Ted Daniels.  Annabelle is

curled up on the sofa, wrapped up in a blanket.  Rita and Ted

notice that Theresa doesn't even look at Annabelle.

INT. ERIN'S APARTMENT, KITCHEN - DAY

Erin is lying in bed, home sick, talking on the phone.  She's

talking over the noise of TANIA, her 20-something Eastern

European nanny, vacuuming the hall.

INTERCUT WITH

INT. DANIELS' HOUSE - DAY

Ted Daniels is on the phone.  Rita is next to him.

INT. MASRY & VITITOE, BRENDA'S DESK - DAY

The phone rings.  Brenda picks up.

INTERCUT WITH Erin at home, still in bed, so irritated.

Erin hangs up.  Then, with a groan, she pulls her weary body

out of bed.

INT. MASRY & VITITOE, RECEPTION - DAY

Erin drags herself into the office.

She heads toward Ed's office, but stops when she sees a

meeting in progress in the conference room.  Ed is on the

side of the table facing her, flanked by Potter and Theresa.

On the other side of the table, are FOUR SUITED BACKS.

Erin feels this like a sock in the gut.  She stares at the

meeting, stunned.

INT. MASRY & VITITOE, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

This band of PG&E lawyers is the oldest and most impressive

of all.  Ed, Potter, and Theresa are listening to the most

senior PG&E lawyer, MR. CORBIN, talk.

Ed and Potter hear this and think about it.

As Ed mulls this, he sees, beyond Mr. Corbin,

ERIN

staring at him from the other side of the glass wall, her

face cold with hurt and anger.

He gets up and goes out into:

INT. MASRY & VITITOE, MAIN ROOM - DAY

Ed comes out.  Erin's so angry she can barely breathe.

He resists being dragged into an knock-down, drag-out fight.

She starts to COUGH and CRUMBLE, but fights it.

By now the entire office is watching.  As are the lawyers in

the conference room.

Erin reaches into her bag, pulls out her cel phone.

She throws it at him and storms away.  The phone hits the

glass wall of the conference room, CRACKING it.  Ed just

stands there, with the lawyers staring at him through the

splintered glass wall.

EXT. MASRY & VITITOE PARKING LOT - DAY

Erin gets to her car.  As she opens the door, the ALARM

SOUNDS.  She fumbles with her keychain, trying to turn it

off, but she's too sick and upset to figure it out.  With the

siren still blaring, she kicks at the car in rage.

INT. ERIN'S CAR - NIGHT

Erin's driving home.  As she turns onto her street, her

headlights wash across the sidewalk and illuminate a small

boy, wearing a backpack, walking the other way.

She looks over her shoulder, but the sidewalk is too dark.

She pulls a U-turn in the middle of the street.  A CAR HONKS.

Erin scans the sidewalk, finally sees him again.  Holy shit,

is right.  It's Matthew, wandering the streets at night.

She pulls ahead of Matthew and bumps up onto the sidewalk,

blocking his path.  When he sees her car, he turns and runs

the other way.  Erin leaps out and follows him.

She catches up and collars him.

INT. ERIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

MUSIC is playing.  TANIA is on the phone.  The receiver is

yanked from her hand.  She turns to see Erin hovering over

her, barely containing herself.

INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MATTHEW AND KATIE'S ROOM - NIGHT

Matthew's in his bed, facing the wall.  Erin sitting on the

foot of his bed, near tears.  Katie's watching from her bed.

She lays her hand on his shoulder, but he shrugs it off and

inches away from her.

INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, HALLWAY - NIGHT

Erin comes out of the bedroom.  As she turns to close the

door, she collapses to the floor in a heap.  Out cold.

INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT

A busy Southland ER.  George bursts through the doors with

Katie, Matthew and Beth in tow.  He goes up to the desk.

INT. ER WAITING AREA - DAY

The kids are waiting.  George is talking to a DOCTOR.

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE ERIN'S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Matt and Katie sit on the cheap plastic chairs outside the

room.  Katie is holding Beth, who's sleeping.

INT. ERIN'S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Erin's in bed, hooked up to an IV, looking exhausted.  All

untouched food tray is beside her bed.  George is standing

across the room from her, arms crossed tight across his

chest, keeping his distance.

A moment of thick silence.

As she watches him reach for his motorcycle helmet, to leave,

she's hit with a wave of regret.

There's a KNOCK at the door, and Ed enters.  George looks at

him.  Not interested in her apologies.

And Erin watches George leave the room, then turns to Ed.

INT. ERIN'S HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER

Ed has taken off his coat and pulled a chair up next to

Erin's bed.  He's eating the pudding off her tray.

But his mind's made up.  He stands to leave.

EXT. HINKLEY FIREHOUSE - NIGHT

The parking lot is empty, except for three Mercedes.  Ed,

Potter, and Theresa are in the doorway, going over their

notes.  A TRUCK pulls into the lot.

INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

Katie and Matt are watching TV.  Beth is playing near them.

Behind them, Erin is lying on the couch, under a blanket,

distractedly trying to watch TV.  She checks her watch.

EXT. HINKLEY FIREHOUSE - NIGHT

The lot is filling with more cars and trucks; headlights

criss-cross each other as people pull in from all directions.

INT. ERIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Erin's sitting up now, jiggling her knee, unable to sit

still.  She checks her watch again.  6:30.  She can't take

it.  She throws off the blanket and gets up.

INT. HINKLEY FIREHOUSE - NIGHT

CLOSE ON HANDS.  As people stream in, they are each handed a

release form with a space for a signature on the bottom.

INT. HINKLEY FIREHOUSE - LATER

It's sweltering.  The room, packed with plaintiffs, hums with

horse flies and tension.  People are fanning themselves with

the release forms.  Potter's addressing them from a raised

platform.  Ed, Theresa, and Andrew are seated behind him.

EXT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT

One more car pulls into the lot.  It's Erin's Chevy.

INT. ERIN'S CAR - NIGHT

Erin unbuckles her seat belt.

EXT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT

Erin gets out of the car, looks around, then goes over to a

window and looks in at the packed meeting.

She climbs up on an old wagon for a better view.

INT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT

Now, in addition to the stifling heat, the large room is

thick with mistrust.  People are shifting in their seats,

whispering to each other.

Agreeing MURMURS ripple through the crowd.

Potter turns around and looks at Ed seated behind him.

The GRUMBLE of discontent has overtaken the room.  More

whispering, more movement.

EXT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT

Erin watches the meeting fall apart.  It's driving her crazy.

INT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT

Potter sees he's losing them, too.  Tries to gain control.

Ted Daniels gets up from his seat.

He drops his agreement form, unsigned, then takes Rita's hand

and heads for the door.

EXT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT

Meeting's over.  The plaintiffs stream out of the firehouse.

Cars start up, headlights flick on.  People pull away.

INT. FIREHOUSE - NIGHT

Everyone has left.  Erin enters and looks around.  The floor

is littered with rejected, unsigned release forms.

She thinks for a moment, then gets an idea.  She picks up a

release form, and leaves the firehouse.

EXT. MINI MALL - NIGHT

Everything's closed, except the KINKO'S store at the far end.

Erin's truck pulls into the parking lot.

INT. KINKO'S - NIGHT

A BORED EMPLOYEE is at the register, painting with Wite-Out

on a blue piece of paper.  Erin enters, dragging her kids.

The Employee gives it to her.  Erin crosses to the copiers.

She slips the release form into one, then taps in the number

of copies: 635.  Presses "START."  The machine WHIRS to life.

EXT. HINKLEY MOTEL - NIGHT

Erin's Chevy pulls into the parking lot.

INT. HINKLEY MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Erin is entering the crappy motel room with her kids.

As the kids wander toward the bathroom, Erin picks up the

phone and dials.  RING, RING.

EXT. HINKLEY MOTEL - DAY

Very early.  Erin is visible in the motel office, talking to

the clerk, when George's motorcycle pulls into the lot.  She

turns around and sees him pulling up next to her Chevy.

EXT. ERIN'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY

Erin comes up to him, hands him a key.

He takes it, glances toward the motel room.

She hands him a wad of cash.

He nods.  She gets into her car.  Before closing the door,

she turns back to him.

She sees how mad she's made him.  Takes a beat.

George softens, shifts.  He steps toward the truck and gently

closes her door, so he's standing close to her.

He thinks about this.  Finally:

He smiles back at her, nods, then tenderly brushes a piece of

hair out of her eyes.

He nods, understanding.  Then he taps the side of her truck

and turns toward the motel room.  She puts the truck in gear

and pulls out.

EXT. HINKLEY, COMMUNITY BOULEVARD - DAY

Erin's Chevy is bombing down the road.

INT. ERIN'S CAR, BACK SEAT - DAY

There are two boxes there -- one full of unsigned release

forms, the other empty.

EXT. DONNA'S NEW HOUSE - DAY

Donna's gardening out front, her head wrapped in a scarf to

cover her chemo-thinning hair, when Erin's Chevy pulls into

the driveway.  Erin gets out, goes to the back of the truck,

gets two of the release forms, then heads over to Donna.

INT. DONNA'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY

Erin is sitting with Pete and Donna.

EXT. DONNA'S HOUSE - DAY

The door opens.  Erin emerges, holding two signed agreements.

Donna is letting her out.

Bob and Ruth Linwood, who are listening intently.

INT. DESOTOS' HOUSE - DAY

Erin and Donna are leaving, saying good-bye to Mary DeSoto.

Erin has a signed release form in her hand.

a small stack of signed release forms in it.  The top one has

Bob Linwood's signature.

IN THE FRONT SEAT

Erin is driving, eating a hamburger, and going over her list

of plaintiffs.

EXT. HINKLEY MART - EVENING

People are going about their shopping.  Rita Daniels is

stopped, talking with A FEW MORE PLAINTIFFS.

INT. THE BACK OF ERIN'S TRUCK - NIGHT

The signed stack has grown; the unsigned stack has shrunk.

Erin drops five more agreements into the "signed" box.

INT. ERIN'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

In the wee hours.  While her kids sleep, Erin sits at the

cheap motel room table, going through her forms, organizing,

alphabetizing.

INT. ERIN'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY

CLOSE ON ERIN, fast asleep at the table, her face pressed

against the linoleum.  There's some NOISE in the room,

WHISPERING.  Erin stirs and looks around to see George behind

her, diapering Beth, while Matt and Katie put their shoes on.

Erin forces herself awake.

He picks up Beth, takes Katie's hand, and calls across the

room to Matthew.

Erin turns to see Matthew holding one of her release forms.

But he's reading it.  And something has caught his attention.

He looks up at Erin.

Erin gently takes the form away from Matthew, wanting to

shield him from the harsh realities of this case.

She replaces the form on top of the stack.

Matthew mulls this over a bit more.

Matthew thinks real hard about this, then heads over to the

door, where George, Beth, and Katie are waiting for him.

Before he leaves, though, he turns back to Erin.

She looks at the group of them, feels their shift toward

acceptance.  Smiles, moved.

INT. ERIN'S TRUCK - DAY

Erin's driving along a dusty Hinkley road, eating cold eggs

out of a take-out container with her fingers.

EXT. FIREHOUSE - DAY

Morning.  A GROUP OF MEN are arriving at work.  Erin's truck

pulls up.  She grabs some release forms from the truck and

wanders up to the men.

She tosses eight more agreements in the signed stack.

of plaintiffs, checking off the ones who have already signed.

INT. LOST CAUSE SALOON - DAY

with about FIVE PLAINTIFFS, all reading agreements.  MIKE

AMBROSINO enters.  Erin spots him.

INT. BACK OF ERIN'S TRUCK - NIGHT

The signed stack is getting bigger.

INT. BACK OF ERIN'S TRUCK - DAY

And bigger.

INT. BACK OF ERIN'S TRUCK - DAY

And still bigger.

EXT. LOST CAUSE SALOON - NIGHT

CLOSE ON ERIN'S TRUNK.  A bunch more forms get thrown onto

the signed stack, which is now much higher than the unsigned.

WIDEN TO REVEAL Erin talking on a nearby pay phone.

She hangs up.  As she turns to get into her car, she finds

herself face-to-face with the Man in the Dark Glasses.

He's just standing there, a foot away, blocking her exit.

She recognizes his truck as the one that chased her.

She pushes past him.  But he grabs her by the arm.  He's a

big guy; it's a strong grab.  Now she's scared.  For a

moment, he does nothing.  Just looks at her.  Then:

Erin takes a beat, realizing she completely misread him.  She

gently pulls her arm away.

INT. LOST CAUSE SALOON - NIGHT

Erin and Embry are the only patrons.  Erin's eating a burger.

Embry has a beer.  He's talking quietly, not looking at her.

Erin tries to hide her excitement at this information.

Destruction of evidence.  Pretty big deal.  Erin plays it

down.  Wipes her mouth with her napkin, takes a sip of beer.

Erin stops, mid-bite.

INT. EMBRY'S GARAGE - NIGHT

He's dug out an inch-high stack of documents.  Erin looks

them over, stunned.  Embry is standing apart from her, hands

shoved deep in his pockets.

INT. MASRY & VITITOE, RECEPTION AREA - DAY

Rosalind is at the desk.  Anna, Brenda, and Jane are helping

themselves to coffee.  Erin enters, with a big box in her

arms and a whole lot of attitude.

But Erin's spotted them and headed off before Rosalind can

finish.  Anna, Brenda and Jane notice the purpose in her

gait.  They watch her with interest.

INT. MASRY & VITITOE, CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

The table is covered with boxes of documents: the anticipated

slew of paper that PG&E is sending them.  Ed, Kurt, Theresa,

Andrew and ABOUT FIVE PARALEGALS are sifting through them.

Erin breezes in like sunshine.

She plunks the box down on the table.  Potter opens the top

of the box.  Looks in.

IN THE DOORWAY, Anna, Brenda and Jane appear, wondering

what's up.  A huge smile of appreciation slowly spreads

across Ed's face.

Erin hands Ed a manila envelope.  He opens it.

Potter and Theresa reel.  Ed shakes his head in disbelief.

And she struts out of the room, leaving everyone slack-jawed.

The CLIP CLIP CLIP of her heels carry her away.

EXT. MASRY & VITITOE BUILDING, HALLWAY - DAY

Erin comes out of the office, flushed with success, and heads

down the hall.  She presses the elevator button.  The doors

open.  As she steps on, Ed comes out of the office.

Erin puts her hand in the door, keeping it from closing.  He

stares at her, in awe.

He looks down the hall at her, standing so tall and proud in

the elevator.  He walks toward her, stops right outside the

elevator.

Of course she will.  She releases her hand so he won't see

her smiling.  Ed watches the doors close.

EXT. PCH - DAY

One of those days when the bay sparkles like a glitter ball.

Erin's Chevy moves up the PCH.  DISCO music emanates from it.

INT. ERIN'S CHEVY - DAY

Erin's at the wheel.  Time has passed -- her hair's a little

different.  She's singing along with "Funky Town."

EXT. BEACH PARKING LOT - DAY

Erin gets out of her new truck, looks, sees the Irvings in a

little cluster.  Donna's under an umbrella.  Pete is

slathering on sunscreen.  The two girls zip out toward the

water.  Erin waves.  Pete and Donna spot her, wave back.

EXT. BEACH - LATER

Donna is standing at the edge of the water, watching her

girls boogie board in.  Erin comes up behind her.

Donna turns, sees her.  Smiles.

Erin sits down on a rock.

Donna sits down next to her.

Tears of vindication spring to Donna's eyes.

She reels.  After a breathless beat:

Donna wipes the tears off her face, then watches the light

flickering off her girls playing in the surf.

Donna is overwhelmed.  Erin pulls her close.

EXT. MASRY & VITITOE'S NEW OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

Now

to power.

INT. MASRY & VITITOE'S NEW OFFICE - DAY

Boxes everywhere.  They just moved in.  Everyone is unpacking

at his or her desk.  Rosalind is manning the new phones.

She lost them.  Her reaction indicates this isn't the first

time.  The front doors open and Erin enters.

Erin heads on down a hall to:

INT. ED'S NEW OFFICE - DAY

A beautiful corner office.  Ed is unpacking when Erin enters.

He reaches into his breast pocket, pulls out a check.  Hands

it to her.

Erin does.  Looks at it.  Her eyes bug out.

She stares at it, speechless.  He goes back to unpacking
