WILD AT HEART

W I L D  A T  H E A R T

And now the story of Sailor and Lula.....

1. EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

A MAN rides a screaming massive Japanese motorcycle - wound out to

maximum R.P.M. up the street.

2. SIGN BY ROADSIDE

The sign reads KIDS PLAYING - SPEED BUMPS.

3. EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

With a whine from hell, the front tire of the motorcycle hits a speed

bump.

The motorcycle becomes airborne and on the way up slices itself in half

as it scrapes along the full length of a Datsun Kingcab.

In the air, the rider and motorcycle twist violently as they fly by.

The motorcycle bounces off a black 66 Chevrolet and makes a sound like

the end of the world.

The rider hits the same Chevy a moment later.  Like a broken ragdoll

shot from a canon, the man punches through the back window blowing glass

for a block.  He stops somewhere under the front seat and a bubble of

blood forms out his nose.

The motorcycle continues on sliding and spinning with an ear-piercing

howl for one entire city block.

4. EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - VACANT LOT - DAY

Two rabid dogs fight ferociously in a vacant lot - ripping each others

flesh.  An OLD COUPLE, both with walkers, inch painfully along nearby.

The old woman begins to turn away, covering her mouth with her hand.

The Old Man grabs the Old Woman by the neck and squeezes.  Out comes a

tangled and sticky ball of hard fruit candies.

5. WASP NEST

A thousand wasps hover threateningly in the air around the nest.  A

SMALL GROUP OF HARDENED CRIMINAL NINE-YEAR OLDS sporting hideous grins,

bat the nest violently to and fro with sticks.  One kid busies himself

shooting a large can of Black Flag garden spray into a crack in the

nest.  Another stomps half-dead wasps up and down the sidewalk.  All the

kids are making animal noises of one sort or the other.

6. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY

around fifty, carries her Martini and Rossi sweet vermouth drink across

the livingroom and answers the phone.

Lula enters her room and cranks up her stereo.  Speed metal music jumps

The guard escorts Sailor away from the telephone and back to his cell.

The iron bars of the door slide across Sailors face and close with a

bang.

10. EXT. THE MUSIC BAR - NIGHT

A beat-up, red 64 Ford Falcon station wagon filled with insane

TEENAGERS on speed and PCP race out of control down the street past the

club - leaning out the car in every direction.  They scream out to the

desolate-looking passerby.

The camera cranes up to the neon club sign and gets lost among the hot

pink neon, the frantic moths and the intense electric buzz.

11. INT. THE MUSIC BAR - NIGHT

Lula and her friend, BEANY THORN, sit at a table drinking rum Coca-Colas

while watching and listening to a white blues band called THE BLEACH

BOYS.  The group segues smoothly from Elmore Jamess Dust my Broom

into Robert Johnsons Me and the Devil and Beany lets out a snort.

Lula and Beany laugh and swallow some of their drinks.

Lula nods and crushes an ice cube with her back teeth and chews it.

The Bleach Boys kick into some kind of Professor Longhair swamp mambo.

from where he lays on the bed.

Lula brushes away her bangs and frowns.  She takes a cigarette from the

she teases her hair.

the sink.

grinding metal.

Lula strikes a match and lights another cigarette.

Somewhere in the hotel a woman laughs.  It is a kind of wild, crazy

laugh, and for the few seconds it lasts, Lulas face goes pale.

Lula and Sailor kiss.  In the middle of the kiss, the womans

creepy/crazy laugh is heard again in the distance and Lulas eyes snap

open with a kind of fear.

35. EXT. FORTUNE HOUSE - BACKYARD - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

Marietta is escorting MARCELLO SANTOS and two stiff drinks to a table in

her backyard.

Santos lifts one hand up to Mariettas chin and raises her face up

towards his.

36. INT. THE HURRICANE - A SPEED METAL CLUB - NIGHT

We see the sign which has all the letters tipped way over to the right -

as if in a hurricane.  Two leaning palm trees border the sign.

One hundred decibels of speed metal.  We see the name Powermad on the

bass drum.

The BAND segues into Slaughter House and its a hot one.  Sailor grabs

Lula and they start dancing like two jacked-up spastics in an electrical

storm.  a few PUNKS actually stop dancing to watch Sailor and Lula.

They thought theyd seen everything.

CU of Lula and Sailor - theyre in love and dancing hot.  An IDIOT PUNK

moves close to Lula and rubs up against her as he dances by.  Sailor

turns to the lead guitar player and signals him to stop the music

immediately.  Suddenly everything is deathly quiet.  Sailor gives the

man a fully extended Reno point...

The Idiot Punk tries to hit Sailor, but Sailor slaps him so hard his

knees almost bend backwards.  The Idiot Punk goes down - fighting back

tears and holding his cheek.

We see an empty carpeted hallway and can hear a ballroom dance band

playing in the distance.  Sailor obviously slightly drunk, comes down

the hall.  He carefully, almost losing his balance, places his drink

outside the MENS ROOM and enters.  Marietta standing down at the other

through her glazed eyes.  Sailor enters the MENS ROOM.

A tall OLD BLACK MAN about seventy years old, wearing a torn green

plastic-wrapped sandwiches, two tuna salad and two cotto salami; six

Twinkies; a package of Chips Ahoy chocolate chip cookies; four Slice

colas; two Barqs root beers; and a large package of fried pork rinds,

extra salted.

Sailor and the man in line behind him watch as the black man gathers up

several more packages of Twinkies along with a few cupcakes and half a

dozen cans of Pretty Kitty cat food, three liver and three chicken

dinner portions, and tosses them on his pile.

He hands an American Express card to the clerk, ERV, who runs it through

the verifier.  The card checks out okay and the old guy prepares a

charge slip, has the man sign it, and bags the purchases.

A telephone begins to ring and everyone looks around.  The Black Man

reaches in his jacket pocket and pulls out a portable phone and punches

send.

Everyone is silent as they watch the old Black Man hobble out.

Erv takes one off the candy and gum rack next to the register and lays

it on the counter.  Sailor gives him a twenty dollar bill.

Johnnie looks around - sees that there are quite a few empty tables - he

looks the men over quickly.

Johnnie wipes off his right hand on his napkin and shakes.

Reggie and Drop Shadow begin eating ferociously, finishing half of their

meal before saying anything more.

whistling.

94. INT. THUNDERBIRD

Lula and Sailor are motoring along.

Sailor and Lula both laugh.  Up ahead, Sailor spots a hitchhiker.  He

slows to pick him up.

The HITCHHIKER is a man about thirty with a pack on his back, and he is

carrying a large, covered cardboard box.  He is filthy, with an uneven

smile that exposes his jagged yellow teeth.  Lula opens the door for

him, and after he loads his stuff, Sailor takes off down the highway.

Roach slides the top off and tilts the box slightly toward the front.

Inside are six small husky pups that are not more than two weeks old.

Roach stares down into the box at the baby huskies and strokes each of

them twice with a religiously unwashed hand.  The dogs whimper and lick

his dirty fingers.

Roach pulls a piece of raw cows liver out of one of his pockets of his

field jacket and begins ripping little bits off it and feeding them to

the dogs.

Sailor pulls off the road onto the shoulder of the highway and stops.

Lula opens her door and jumps out.

Roach sticks the liver back in his pocket and pulls his pack and the box

of tiny canines after him.  Once he and his belongings are deposited on

the roadside, Lula hops back in the car and slams the door.

coldly and waits.  Drop Shadow adjusts his socks.

Johnnie hangs up the phone and exits the booth.  As he crosses the

bar...

Johnnie goes over to Reggie and Drop Shadow and shakes hands.

Reggie orders martinis for the three of them.

walk over to them.

Lula slides over in the front seat and leans across to Sailor.

The kids look worried and take a step back.

station.  Guess who is over the corner cleaning nuts and bolts with a

toothbrush and gasoline ... Its DELL!

When they walk in, the BAND is playing a slow blues and THREE OR FOUR

COUPLES are swaying on the dance floor.  There are a dozen tables and a

long bar in the room which is done up in a strange dark azquatic motif.

Eight of the tables are occupied and SIX OR SEVEN MEN stand at the bar.

Everyone in the place is black except for one WHITE WOMAN who is sitting

alone at a table smoking a cigarette and drinking Pearl straight from

the bottle.  The atmosphere is not friendly, but Lula takes Sailor by

the arm.

They step up to the bar and order two Lone Star beers.  The BARTENDER, a

tall, heavyset man slowly forms his hand into the bird.  He holds his

hand that way while he speaks...

BARTENDER ZANZIBAR

The bartender moves on down the bar.  Lula and Sailor take a small table

near the door.

Sailor looks at the woman.  She lights a new cigarette off a butt, then

squashes the butt in the ashtray.  She is thirty years old, maybe more.

Shoulder-length, bleached blonde hair, black at the roots.  Clear skin,

green eyes.  Long, straight nose with a small bump on it.  She is

wearing a low-cut lavender dress that would have emphasized her breasts

had she not been so flat-chested.  Slender.

Lula gets quiet and sucks on her beer bottle.

BARTENDER ZANZIBAR

She kisses him on the nose and walks back through a dark little door to

the payphone.

Sailor and the bleached blonde in the lavender dress are together on the

dance floor.  Lula sees them, goes over to the bar, picks up a beer

bottle and throws it at Sailor.  The bottle bounces hard off his back

and clangs to the floor, bouncing but not breaking.  Sailor turns around

fast and looks at Lula.  Everybody else in the place is still.

103. EXT. CLUB ZANZIBAR - NIGHT

Lula runs out.  Sailor follows.

Sailor finds her sitting on the ground, leaning against the passenger

side of the Thunderbird.  Lulas eyes are red and wet but she isnt

crying.  Sailor kneels down next to her.

Sailor stands and leans against the hood of the car until Lula gets up

and climbs inside.  He wraps his snakeskin jacket around her and starts

the car.  Lula kisses Sailor on the cheek, puts her head down sideways

on his lap and goes to sleep.  Sailor drives.

104. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - MARIETTAS BEDROOM - NIGHT

106. INT. JOHNNIES HOTEL ROOM - MAISON VIOLETTE - NEW ORLEANS

Marietta hangs up.

107. EXT. SHELL STATION - HOUSTON - DAY

Sailor and Lula are in a Shell station just outside of Houston.  Sailor

is filling the Thunderbird with regular.  An OLD MAN sits near the pumps

listening to the radio playing a sad big band tune.  Lula starts to

slowly snap her fingers to the beat and the old man gives her a

beautiful smile.

Sailor kisses her and climbs into the back seat and lays down.  Lula

slides behind the wheel and lights up a More.  She winks goodbye to the

old man and wheels the car out towards the big beyond.

108. INT. TEXAS HIGHWAY - DAY

The reception gets bad on the big band tune and Lula starts turning the

dial.  Up comes a nationwide call-in talk show and she leaves it there.

ARTIE MAYER, the radio host talks to his callers.

Lula takes a puff of her More and tosses it out the window and starts

turning the radio dial - finds a news station.

110. INT. THUNDERBIRD - HIGHWAY TO SAN ANTONIO - DAY

Sailor jumps awake in fright as Lula yanks the car off the road and

brings it to a screeching halt in the middle of the desert.

Sailor starts spinning the dial.

Suddenly Sailor finds a station - THE STATION - and he and Lula look at

each other in disbelief...

Sailor turns it up full blast and he and Lula dance hard until they

disappear in the dust.

111. INT. MAISON VIOLETTE - LOBBY - NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT

Marietta and Johnnie are standing at the registration desk - talking to

113. INT. MAISON VIOLETTE - LOBBY - NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT

Johnnie enters as Marietta hangs up the phone - covering her fear.

114. INT. MR. REINDEERS PRIVATE DINING ROOM - NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT

Upstairs in a private dining room, Mr. Reindeer is dining with TWELVE

GUESTS in formal evening attire.  Behind him, a JAZZ TRIO and a

STRIPTEASE ARTIST are hard at work.  Mr. Reindeer smiles and leans over

very close to a beautiful WOMAN sitting to his left.

With this, he reaches under the table between her legs.  She turns red

and Mr. Reindeer laughs and lights a cigarette.

Reggie and Drop Shadow enter through a door on the other side of the

room.  Reggie catches Mr. Reindeers eye and smiles.  Reggie reaches in

his pocket and takes out a silver dollar - flips it in the air - catches

it - and puts it back in his pocket.  Mr. Reindeer smiles and waves him

over to the table.  He whispers something in Reggies ear - then gives

him an envelope.

Reggie pockets the envelope - joins Drop Shadow - and as they are

leaving the dining room, they join a woman, JUANA, who looks half-

Oriental, half-Cajun.  She wears a strange, short, yellowish-bleached

blonde wig.

115. INT. GALATOIRES RESTAURANT - NIGHT

They go downstairs together.  At the bottom of the stairs, Reggie and

Drop Shadow catch sight of Johnnie who is sitting in the back of the

restaurant having dinner with Marietta.  When Johnnie sees the two of

them he waves, but at the same time gets a chill up his spine.

Marietta continues to stare at Reggie, Drop Shadow, and Juana before

turning back to Johnnie.  She also feels the fear.

CUT TO:

116. INT. MAISON VIOLETTE - STAIRWAY AND HALLWAY - NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT

Johnnie and Marietta climb together to the second floor and Johnnie

takes Marietta to her room.

116A. MAISON VIOLETTE - JOHNNIES ROOM - NIGHT

Johnnie smiles and heads up to his room.  He opens the door and steps

inside.  WHAM!!  Johnnie is knocked in the head with a heavy metal pipe

and he goes down hard.  A large dark figure grabs on to him and pulls

him to an open window and lowers him into the back of a pick-up.  The

dark figure follows out the window.

DISSOLVE TO:

117. INT. MAISON VIOLETTE - LOBBY - NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT

Marietta is sitting in the lobby trying to hold herself together - half-

sobbing.  The MANAGER approaches and sits next to her.

The front desk clerk steps from behind his desk and hurries into the

lobby.

He hands Marietta a note inside an envelope which she opens and reads

immediately.  We see the note.

NOTE

Gone fishing with a friend - maybe

buffalo hunting.  Johnnie.

The front door of the hotel opens and in walks Santos.  He seems to know

exactly where Marietta is and steps to the door of the sitting room off

the lobby.  He stands in the doorway and smiles at Marietta.

The Manager and Desk Clerk bow to Marietta and Santos and go back

through the lobby.  Santos walks over to Marietta.  Marietta stands.

118. EXT. SMALL HUT - DESERTED BAYOU - NIGHT

Light comes from one small dirty window.

119. INT. SMALL HUT - DESERTED BAYOU - NIGHT

Johnnie is tied to a small wooden straight-backed chair.  His mouth is

gagged and taped shut.  His hair is caked with dry blood and one fresh

tickle curls down his forehead to his eyes which are just now beginning

to open and focus.  Juana is finishing tying his left ankle to the chair

leg.  Johnnie moans and Juana brings her big, smiling face up in front

of his.

Juana steps two paces across the hut where two dirty old soda bottles

sit - one in one corner perched on a dried tree trunk - the other in the

opposite corner perched on an old fence post.  Juana touches the left

bottle (#1) once, and crosses and touches the right bottle (#2) once and

comes back and touches Johnnies face.

Reggie and Drop Shadow step out of the darkness behind Johnnie and come

around to face him.

Reggie and Juana kiss hot in front of Johnnie.  Juana puts her face down

in front of Johnnies again.

Reggie reaches his hand around in front of Johnnie - showing him a .45

Automatic.

Drop Shadow pulls the hammer back which makes a loud click.

Johnnie jumps as Drop Shadow blows a big hole in the far wall in front

of Johnnie.

Reggie comes out in front of Johnnie - Juana grabs him.  They kiss hot

again.

Juana screams like a monster from hell coming up close to Johnnies

face.

Reggie goes back behind Johnnie quick.

Reggie reaches his hand around Johnnies face - tears off tape and gag -

then opens his hand and shows Johnnie a cufflink with a particular

design in turquoise, orange, and silver.

As her finger touches Johnnies face there is a loud CLICK.  Johnnie

moans and closes his eyes.

Johnnie starts to scream and violently try to move out of his chair.

We see a hole in the front of the barrel - BOOM!!!

The opposite wall and bottles get covered with blood.  Juana and Reggie

race into each others arms and kiss right above Johnnies dead,

bloodied head.

120. INT. THUNDERBIRD - TWO LANE TEXAS FARM ROAD - NIGHT

Lula and Sailor are driving through the dark desert.

Lula stays quiet for a moment - listening to the heavy hum of the V-8.

121. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - LIVINGROOM/UPSTAIRS HALLWAY/BEDROOM - NIGHT

The livingroom is on fire.

The livingroom is on fire and we move upstairs - Lula races through the

smoke-filled hallway to her mothers bedroom.

The livingroom is on fire and Lula throws open the door to her mothers

bedroom just in time to see Marcello Santos leaving through a window.

Her mother laughs a wild, crazy laugh - exactly the same laugh Lula

heard on the porch of the Cape Fear Hotel.

122. INT. THUNDERBIRD - TWO LANE TEXAS FARM ROAD - NIGHT

Sailor starts to slow down.  The highway is suddenly littered with

clothes strewn everywhere and two open suitcases smashed near the side

of the road.  Sailor slows down to a crawl.  He and Lula turn to each

other - theyve just seen TWO DEAD BODIES.  One close to the side of the

highway - and other just off in the desert brush.  Off behind is an

overturned car.

Coming out of the darkness is a YOUNG GIRL, her clothes half torn off -

blood draining out of several deep wounds.

They get out of the car and the girl comes toward them screaming.

The girl starts walking back toward the car.

Sailor reaches out cautiously and takes hold of the girls arm.

She keeps digging her fingers into a bloody wound in her head.

The girls falls to one knee and struggles to get back up.  Sailor and

Lula each take an arm and try to help her.

Sailor and Lula help the girl stand, but her eyes start rolling back and

a bunch of fresh blood comes gushing up out of her mouth.

Sailor kneels down next to the girl and runs his hand gently across her

forehead.

The girl dies.  Sailor and Lula hold real still for a moment.  Lula

starts to cry.

Before getting up, Sailor lets his hand come off the girls forehead

down over her eyes - closing them.  He puts his hand on her cheek then

gets up.  He puts his arm around Lula and they go back to her car.

Sailor helps Lula in on her side and closes the door for her.  He goes

around, gets in and looks over at Lula, who breaks down crying harder.

Sailor starts the car and takes off.

FADE OUT:

FADE IN:

123. INT. THUNDERBIRD - BIG TUNA - MORNING

The Thunderbird drives past a large stucco fish on a rock stand which

has a sign on it that says BIG TUNA, TEXAS.  Sailor cruises the T-Bird

along the main street of Big Tuna, eye-balling the place.

123A. EXT. IGUANA MOTEL - MORNING

Sailor pulls the car up in front of the Iguana Motel.

124. INT. IGUANA MOTEL - DAY

The room is simple: double bed, dresser, mirror, chair, sink, toilet,

bathtub (no shower), electric fan, window overlooking the street.

She strips off the spread, tosses it in a corner and sits down on the

bed.

They stare at each other.  Lula suddenly feels sick to her stomach and

slumps down on the edge of the bed.

125. EXT. REDS GARAGE - DAY

A tall, skinny man, RED, in his early thirties with wild, uncombed hair

the color of pomegranate, walks out of the garage.

Sailor holds out his right hand to shake.

Red extends his oil-blackened right hand and shakes.

Two men, SPARKY and BUDDY, both about forty, walk up to Red.  One of

them wears a grey baseball cap with a Confederate flag on it and the

other has an LBJ straw Stetson.

Sailor introduces himself to Sparky and Buddy and Rex.  They all shake

hands or nod and move out of the sun to drink their beers.

Sailor finishes his beer, stands it on the ground and steps on it,

crushing it flat.

126. EXT. IGUANA BANK - DAY

The temperature on the tower reads One Hundred Twelve.

CUT TO:

127. INT. IGUANA MOTEL - DAY

In front of the door there is a large, damp spot on the rug where about

a hundred and fifty flies are buzzing and landing.  Sailor sees this

when he opens the door.  He steps across the large spot and finds Lula

just waking up on the bed.

Lula opens her eyes and looks at him.

Sailor goes over and sits on the bed.

Sailor strokes Lulas head.

Lula closes her eyes.

128. EXT. SKY OVER BIG TUNA - EVENING

The darkening evening sky is filled with flying monkeys.

129. INT. IGUANA MOTEL - COURTYARD - NIGHT

Sailor, Lula, Sparky, and Buddy are sitting in the courtyard of the

motel sharing Sparkys fifth of Ezra Brooks.  An electric bug killer is

working overtime.  Buddy is reading from a newspaper.

Sailor looks at Lula.

The assistant manager, TOMMY THOMPSON, speaks from the shadows behind

the group.

They all look over at Tommy.

BOBBY PERU walks in and comes over.

Bobby nods to Lula and offers a hand to Sailor.

Sparky and Buddy laugh.

Bobby laughs.  He has a lopsided grin that exposes only three brownish

front teeth and he has flat black eyes that seem to reflect no light.

Bobby pulls up a chair and pours himself a shotglass full of whiskey.

Bobby looks down at his hand, flexs it.

Bobby sips the whiskey and closes his eyes for several seconds before

reopening them and looking at Buddy.  His eyes open slowly and they

practically burn a hole in Buddy.

Sparky refills Bobbys shotglass.  Bobby tosses it back in one gulp.

He walks out and after hes gone...

Lula puts a hand on Sailors leg.

They say goodnight to Sparky and Buddy and head for their room.

130. INT. IGUANA MOTEL - SAILOR AND LULAS ROOM - NIGHT

Lula goes right to the bed and flops down on it.

Lula listens to Sailor brush his teeth, urinate into the toilet and

flush it.  Sailor comes out of the bathroom and climbs into bed.

Lula hands Sailor a note which reads Im pregnant.  Sailor looks into

her eyes.

Sailor crumples the note and puts it in the ashtray.

CU of Lula setting fire to the pregnant note in the ashtray.

DISSOLVE TO:

131. INT. IGUANA MOTEL - SAILOR AND LULAS ROOM - DAY

the door.  Bobby Peru stands outside.

Bobby enters the bathroom and starts to urinate.

132. EXT. PERDITA DURANGOS HOUSE - DAY

Sailor pulls the T-Bird up front and hurries up to the screen door.

Flies are buzzing all around.  PERDITA DURANGO comes forward out of the

darkness inside.

Sailor goes back to his car and takes off.

133. INT. INGUANA MOTEL - SAILOR AND LULAS ROOM - DAY

Bobby is pacing around the room.

Suddenly Bobby jumps back, shakes his head and straightens his hair.

He steps a little closer to her.

With all the strength she can muster, Lula slaps Bobby across the face.

Bobby grabs on to her hard.

Bobby moves in very close to her - Lulas trembling.  Bobby puts his

hand on her neck and moves it up and down behind her ear.

His hand moves down over her breasts - down across her stomach - and

down.  Lulas left hand opens and spreads wide.

Bobby leaves smiling and slams the door.  Lula stands trembling clicking

her heels together.

134. EXT. IGUANA MOTEL - AFTERNOON

Sailor is just about finished changing the oil in the Thunderbird when

Bobby Peru pulls up in the maroon Eldo.

Sailor throws some stuff in the trunk and closes the lid.

136. INT. ROSARITAS - DAY

They enter a long, dark room where a DOZEN MEN, most of them wearing

cowboy hats, sit on stools at a bar drinking beer out of frosted mugs.

They claim two stools.

The BARTENDER brings over two bottle and two mugs - then walks back to

the other end of the bar.

DISSOLVE TO:

LATER

Bobby returns from the jukebox and sits down next to Sailor.

Pee Wees steel guitar ripples through the cigarette haze and buzzes

around Sailors head.  His reflection wobbles in the long mirror behind

the bar.

Sailor stares at Bobby and works hard to focus his eyes.

Bobby grins, showing those three brown teeth.

136A. EXT. ROARITAS - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

Bobby looks around in the purple twilight before he opens the trunk of

the Eldorado.  He peels back a brown army blanket.

Bobby closes the trunk.  Sailor stands - hesitating to commit.

Sailor stares at him and his fist clenches.

Bobby cocks his head and squints at him questioningly.

137. INT. IGUANA MOTEL - SAILOR AND LULAS ROOM - NIGHT

Sailor bends over the bed and kisses Lulas hair above her left ear.

Lula rolls onto her back.

Sailor sits on the bed and starts undressing.

Sailor gets into bed.

Lula sticks a More between her lips and lights it.  She takes a deep

drag, blows out the smoke, and stares at Sailor.

Lula puffs hard on her cigarette.

Sailor turns on his side, away from Lula, and pulls a pillow over his

head.

S				AILOR

Lula lights a second More off the first one and stubs out the butt on

the dresser top.

Lula turns over, away from Sailor.

CU of Sailors eyes - he remembers.

138. INT. BAY ST. CLEMENT HOTEL - STAIRCASE - NIGHT

Sailor and Lula are walking down the carpeted stairs when Sailor is

called by BOB RAY LEMON, who is coming down towards them fast.  Marietta

stands at the top - watching.

As Bob Ray passes Lula on the stairs - he puts his hand between her

legs.  Sailor starts to see red.  Bob Ray smiles and steps down to

Sailor.  He leans in and whispers in Sailors ear.

Bob Ray pulls a knife, but Sailors fist is already halfway through Bob

Rays brain.  From there, Sailor steps firmly into the crazy zone.

Amidst blood-curdling hysterical screams from a growing throng of

SOUTHERN BELLES, Sailor starts taking Bob Ray apart limb by limb and

doesnt stop until Bob Ray lays completely destroyed and completely dead

at the foot of the stairs.  The crowd of formally dressed onlookers

stand aghast.  Sailor stares up at Marietta.  Both their eyes burning

with hate.

139. INT. IGUANA MOTEL - SAILOR AND LULAS ROOM - NIGHT

Sailor is dripping with sweat.  His teeth are clenched tight and his

fists violently grip the sheets, as if any minute he could tear the bed

apart.

140. INT. PERDITA DURANGOS HOUSE - NIGHT

Bobby lets the screen door bang shut behind him as he comes in and roams

around the livingroom.

Bobby keeps circling.

Bobby stops walking and stares at the photograph on the wall.

Perdita turns her head and looks, then turns back.

We see the photo now.  In it are Perdita along with her sister, Juana,

and her husband, Reggie, whom we recognize as the killers of Johnnie.

Bobby turns around and leans down and puts his face next to Perditas

from behind.

Bobby takes out a silver dollar and flips it into the air.  It lands

tails up in his hand.  He pockets it.

Bobby lowers his hands into the front of Perditas blouse and cups her

breasts.  She burns the back of his left wrist with her cigarette.

Bobby jumps back, then grabs Perditas hair and pulls her over the couch

onto the floor.  Neither of them speak.  She tries to stand, but Bobby

keeps his right foot on her chest while he blows the back of his wounded

wrist.  Perdita shoves his leg to one side and rolls away.  She stand up

and spits at him.

CUT TO:

141. INT. IGUANA MOTEL - DAY

Lula lays very still on the bed.  Her head is close to the small

turquoise radio on the bedside table.  She is listening to a piece of

sad, nostalgic music and as we move in closer to her and the radio - the

volume increases.

Lula remembers some moments in her life with Sailor: (Music continues

over)

When he kissed her outside the jail gate.

When he touched her breast the day after he got out of jail.

When they sat behind the Confederate Soldier.

When they danced to Slaughter House.

Suddenly, Lula sees an image in her mind that she does not recognize.

She sees an abstract image of reflected light with two eyes looking

through it at her.  The image puzzles her.

(The Music continues over)

142. EXT. IGUANA MOTEL - DAY

The big Eldorado pulls up in front of the Iguana Motel where Sailor has

been waiting in the hot sun.  Bobby opens the door.

Sailor crawls in the back seat and sees Perdita just as she floors it

and they take off in a cloud of dust.

142A. INT. ELDORADO - BIG TUNA - DAY

143. EXT. RAMOS FEED STORE - DAY

Bobby slips the panty hose over his head and adjusts it.  His face looks

crooked and distorted.

Sailor rips open the package and pulls a nylon leg over his head,

stretching the calf part to fit.

Perdita pulls up in front of the store.  The street is deserted.

CUT TO:

144. INT. RAMOS FEED STORE - FRONT OFFICE - DAY

Bobby and Sailor enter the feed store.  Bobby raises his sawed-off

shotgun and points it at the TWO OLD MEN behind the counter.

Bobby and the two men head down the hall into the back room.

145. EXT. RAMOS FEED STORE - DAY

Suddenly, an Iguana County DEPUTY SHERIFF cruises up in a patrol car and

parks it on angle in front of the idling Eldo.  The Deputy gets out of

his car and walks over to the drivers side of the Eldorado.

Perdita stubs out her Marlboro in the ashtray.

146. INT. RAMOS FEED STORE - FRONT OFFICE - DAY

The two old guys have their hands in the air and are moving back behind

the counter.  Bobby is just finishing tying off a bag of money.  Sailor

is by the front door holding his pistol on the two old guys.  When Bobby

finishes tying the money bag - he lifts the shotgun and blows a hole

through the chest of one of the old men.  Sailor goes into shock.

CUT TO:

147. EXT. RAMOS FEED STORE - DAY

Reacting to the shot, Perdita jams the gear shift into reverse and peels

out, knocking the deputy down.

148. INT. RAMOS FEED STORE - FRONT OFFICE - DAY

Sailor turns his pistol on Bobby now.  Bobby spins his shotgun around

and points it at Sailor.

The second old man is reaching under the counter.

Sailor fires his .32 at Bobby.  There are no live bullets in his pistol.

It just makes a dry click.  Bobby smiles and is just about to kill

Sailor when out of the corner of his eye he catches sight of the second

old man bringing out a big shotgun of his own.  Bobby instinctively

spins and empties the second barrel of his two-barrel shotgun into the

old gentleman.  As Bobby is reloading fast, Sailor sprints through the

front door.  Bobby is right behind him as he flys out the front door.

148A. EXT. RAMOS FEED STORE - DAY

The deputy recovers and comes up on one knee with his revolver clasped

in both hands.  He fires his first shot into Bobbys thigh and his

second into Bobbys left hip.  The shock of the initial slug causes

Bobby to drop the bag.  The impact of the second forces Bobbys right

hand to twist sideways to that both barrels of the shotgun wedge under

his chin.  The Ithaca goes off, blowing Bobby backwards through the

RAMOS on the plate glass window of the feed store.

Sailor hits the ground - losing the Smith as he falls.  He puts his hand

over his hosieried head and keeps his face in the dirt until the deputy

orders him to stand up.

149. INT. IGUANA COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY

Lula is sitting on a bench in the waiting room of the Iguana County

Courthouse Building when Marietta and Santos walk in.  As soon as she

sees Lula, Marietta runs over, sits down next to her and hugs and kisses

her.

Tears are pouring down Mariettas cheeks.  She holds Lula to her and

Lula does not resist.  Lula just stares at Santos.

Marietta takes Lula by the shoulders and looks straight at her.  Lulas

eyes are bloodshot, her hair is greasy and stringy, and her cheeks are

pale.

Santos steps forward.  Lula begins to tremble.

Santos arms begin to go around Lula.  Lula lets out a blood-curdling

scream and shakes like a leaf on a tree.  Santos grabs her hard - in a

bear hug.  On one shirt cuff we see a cufflink which is turquoise,

orange, and silver.

150. INT. WALLS UNIT - DAY

Sailor lays on his jail bed reading a letter from Lula.

Dearest Sailor Darling,

The first thing youll want to know is Im keeping the baby.

Mama wasnt for it in the beginning but I think shes looking

forward to it.  Im gonna name it Pace no matter if its a

boy or a girl.  Pace Ripley sounds good, dont it?  Its

kind of hard to believe that Pace will be six years old

when you get out.

I feel like Im kind of in prison too, but I know in six

months, itll be over and Ill have a son or daughter to

show for it.  Our child!!

I love you Sailor.  I dont know how much or what it

means though I miss you an awful bunch sometimes I know

youre thinking about me cause I can feel it.  I miss

you not being around to call me peanut nobody else ever

called me that.

Mama married Santos.  It just about drove me crazy.  My

daddy left a lot of money somehow and theyre spending

it like there is no tomorrow.  Im going to move out as

soon as I can.

Mama and Santos said because of the baby theyre lookin

at the two of us in a different light - whatever that

means.

Johnnie Farragut has plumb disappeared.  No one knows

where.  I miss him, but not near as much as I miss you.

Time dont really fly honey does it?

Love,

your Lula

P.S. I miss dancing...

151. INT. FORTUNE HOUSE - DAY

Lula sits in her bedroom reading a letter from Sailor.

Dear Lula,

It is fine with me about the baby as you already know.

And Pace being your family name and all is just right.

What about a middle name if it is a boy after my

granddaddy Roscoe?  He would be proud I know though

he is long passed.  Pace Roscoe Ripley does not sound

so bad do you think?

This place is not so pretty as Pee Dee.  Not pretty

at all.  There are boys inside these walls meaner

than Peru you can bet.  There is a Death House.  I

am getting along.  The only thing is not thinking

about the future.

I miss dancing with you, too.  I love you.  It is

hard to end this letter.  If I stop writing youre

gone.  There is not a lot more to say though.

Vava con dios mi amor.

Sailor

LONG FADE OUT:

152. INT. MARIETTA FORTUNES HOUSE - EVENING/

153. INT. LULA FORTUNES HOUSE - EVENING - (SIX YEARS LATER)

Six years later...  Lula stands in the living room holding a glass of

ice water while talking on the telephone to her mother.  Marietta is

wearing a giant diamond ring on one hand and the other hand is holding a

Martini and Rossi sweet vermouth.  Marietta is slumped over in an

ottoman with wheels and is pushing her drunken self around the

livingroom as she talks on the phone.

Lula hangs up and throws her glass of water at a picture of her mother -

draining it.

154. INT. LULAS CAR - EVENING

PACE ROSCOE FORTUNE is a shy, polite, innocent six-year old who wears a

long-billed fishing cap and pants with suspenders.

Lula makes a wide left turn onto Jeff Davis Highway without signaling,

causing the driver of a white Bonneville headed across the intersection

to jam on his brakes in order to avoid a collision.  The Bonneville

driver sits on his horn and shouts at Lula.

Lula steadies the steering wheel of her Camaro with her left elbow while

she strikes a match and lights up a More.  She throws the match out the

window and takes possession of the wheel with both hands, the cigarette

is clamped in her teeth.

Lula puffs furiously several times on her More before she takes it out

of her mouth and drops it.

Lula feels around on the floor with one hand until she finds the

cigarette.  Sirens can be heard up ahead.

They pass an automobile accident where a man has been thrown into the

curb - his head broken open and bleeding.  The ambulance is just

arriving.  Lula looks away.

155. ACCIDENT - EVENING

A CRAZY MAN in a wheelchair is wheel up to the accident victim, who is

bleeding profusely and in a state of shock.  The man in the wheelchair

stares at him for a moment.

Pace looks up at his mother.

157. EXT. TRAIN STATION - EVENING

Lula pulls the Camaro into in the station parking lot and kills the

minutes past six.

CUT TO:

158. INT. TRAIN STATION - EVENING

Lula sees Sailor as soon as she opens the door.  He is sitting in an

orange plastic chair against the opposite wall, smoking a cigarette.

Sailor smiles.

He stands up and looks down at Pace, who is still holding hands with

Lula.  Sailor puts out his right hand.

Pace releases Lulas hand and puts his own in Sailors.  Sailor grips it

gently but firmly, pumps once, then lets go.

Sailor looks at Lula.  Her eyes are full of tears and she lets them

loose.  Sailor tries to smile.

Sailor picks up his black metal suitcase and follows them to the car.

CUT TO:

159. INT. LULAS CAR - NIGHT

Lula drives.

Lula starts to reply, then stops.  She stares straight ahead, gripping

the wheel hard.  Suddenly, she pulls over to the side of the road, turns

off the engine and gets out of the car.

Sailor gets out and goes over to Lula, who is leaning back against the

hood.

Sailor goes around to the drivers side, reaches in and pulls the keys

out of the ignition.  He unlocks the trunk, removes his suitcase, and

closes the lid.

Sailor slips the keys in her shirt pocket and leans his head into the

car.

Sailor stands up and looks at Lula.  Her eye makeup runs in dark streaks

down her face.

ECU of Lulas eyes.  Her eye makeup runs like black sweat over eyes and

down her cheeks as in Sailors dream.

He picks up his suitcase, kisses Lula lightly on the lips and walks

away.  She lets him go.

160. EXT. CITY STREET - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

Sailor walks down the street pretending hard not to care.

161. INT. LULAS CAR - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

Lula climbs in behind the wheel - sobbing.  Pace sits sadly, staring out

the window.

162. EXT. CITY STREET - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

Sailor continues walking down the street.  A GANG OF INSANE KILLER

TEENAGERS on PCP appear and come towards Sailor.  They circle around

him, coming in closer for the kill.

Thats all it takes.  The gang is on him.  Sailor tries to defend

himself, but one big punch to his nose sends him down and out.  Blood

begins to pour from his swelling nose.

162A. EXT. CITY STREET - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

CU OF SAILORS FACE - a bright light illuminates it.

In the sky above Sailor, a large glowing bubble holding the beautiful

Good Witch of the North comes floating down above him.

Sailors eyes suddenly see the Good Witch through his closed eyelids.

His mouth speaks through closed lips.

The Good Witch disappears.

162. EXT. CITY STREET - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

Sailor opens his eyes and drags himself and his giant swollen nose up on

his feet.  The gang still stands around him.

Sailor turns around and starts running back.  The gang watches him go.

163. INT. LULAS CAR - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

Lula sits in the car in the middle of a giant traffic jam.  She is still

crying and horns are honking all around them.

164. EXT. CITY STREET - LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING

Sailor runs up the street, holding his nose and SCREAMING LULAS NAME.

He rounds a corner and spots her in the middle of a sea of cars.

He starts running towards her - leaping from one car to another until he

jumps on the hood of Lulas car.

She sees him.

Lula wriggles out of the car and flys into his arms.  Behind them is a

giant golden sunset.  As they embrace - the sound of the horns goes

away.  Lulas gaze goes to a reflection of golden light on a windshield.

It is the same abstract scene she saw before in her room in Big Tuna,

but now she knows what it is.  It is Paces happy, smiling eyes looking

up at the two of them in love.

Sailor, with a giant blue nose, looks into Lulas eyes and sings Love

Me Tender.

The people in their cars, and the people on the street look on with a

feeling of love and happiness in their hearts.

THE END
