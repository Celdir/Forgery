"JACOB'S LADDER"

by

Bruce Joel Rubin

EXT.  VIETNAM - DUSK

A swarm of helicopters swoops out of a yellow sky and deposits an army

of men over a Vietnamese hillside.

The SOLDIERS scramble over the terraced rice paddies for the protection

of the jungle. Falling into coulmns, like strands of soldier ants,

seventy-five men, at combat readiness, assemble on the edge of a

sweltering wilderness.

It is dusk. The mood is lazy, soporific. Members of one platoon huddle

close to the ground smoking a joint.

JACOB SINGER returns to the group, pulling up his pants.

JACOB gives them the finger.

Laughter.

GEORGE reaches out, extending a joint. Suddenly he gasps and falls to

the ground, his body convulsing uncontrollably. The others stand back,

startled. JACOB grabs him and shoves a rifle barrel between his

chattering teeth.

Before anyone can answer JERRY grabs his head, screaming. He turns

frantically in all directions.

In seconds JERRY is spinning wildly out of control, his head shaking

into a terrific blur. He crashes into FRANK with the force of a truck.

FRANK slams into the ground as all the air rushes from his lungs. He

begins gasping and hyperventilating. His eyes grow wide and frenzied as

he gulps for air. Fear and confusion sweep across his face. The MEN

watch, horrified, as FRANK's terror escalates beyond reason into all-

out panic.

Suddenly FRANK begins howling. He lunges for his bayonet and, without

warning, attacks the MEN around him.

PAUL spins out of the way as FRANK's bayonet impales the ground. JACOB

jumps on top of FRANK and wrestles him into the tall grass. PAUL rushes

to his assistance.

JACOB stares at FRANK's face as FRANK struggles beneath him. It is the

face of a madman.

The sudden chaos is intensified by the sound of fighting erupting

behind them. Guns crackle and bursts of light penetrate the darkening

sky.

The MEN spin around. PAUL panics and jumps to his feet, leaving JACOB

alone with FRANK. FRANK's eyes burn with demonic force as he gathers

his strength.

Dark figures, silhouetted by the setting sun, are storming at them.

SOLDIERS squint to see. It is a horrifying vision.

Gunfire explodes on all sides. Suddenly PAUL flips out. He begins

screaming uncontrollably, ripping at his clothes and skin. FRANK is

struggling like four men and JACOB is weakening in his effort to

restrain him. Bayonets glimmer in the exchange of fire. Bodies fall.

More bodies keep coming. The first wave is upon them.

ROD shoots into the air. Shadowy forms hurl forward screaming like

banshees. ROD, squinting, jabs with his bayonet, piercing the belly of

his attacker. Agonizing cries accompany his fall. ROD yanks the bayonet

out and stabs again.

In the midst of this madness FRANK shoots to his feet and slams the

butt of his rifle into JACOB's back. There is a cracking sound. JACOB's

eyes freeze with pain. His hands rush for his spine. As he spins around

one of the ATTACKERS jams all eight inches of his bayonet blade into

JACOB's stomach. JACOB screams. It is a loud and piercing wail.

CUT ON THE SOUND OF THE SCREAM to a sudden rush through a long dark

tunnel. There is a sense of enormous speed accelerating toward a

brilliant light. The rush suggests a passage between life and death,

but as the light bursts upon us we realize that we are passing through

a SUBWAY STATION far below the city of NEW YORK.

INT.  SUBWAY - NIGHT

THE WHEELS OF AN EXPRESS TRAIN screech through the station. JACOB

SINGER, sitting alone in the last car, wakes up. The sounds of the

scream and the grating wheels merge. He is dazed and confused, not

certain where he is.

JACOB glances around the empty car. His eyes gravitate to overhead

advertisements for hemorrhoid perparations and savings banks. Gradually

his confusion subsides. Shifting uncomfortably he pulls a thick book

out of his back pocket, "The Stranger" by Albert Camus. He begins

reading. Another station blurs by.

JACOB is a good-looking man, of obvious intelligence. He is in his mid-

thirties. It is surprising that he is wearing a mailman's uniform. He

doesn't look like one.

The subway ride seems to go on interminably. JACOB is restless and

concerned. He glances at his watch. It is 3:30 A.M. Putting his book in

his back pocket, JACOB stands up and makes his way through the deserted

car.

INT.  SUBWAY TRACKS - NIGHT

JACOB enters the rumbling passageway between the cars. The wheels spark

against the rails. The dark tunnel walls flash by. He pulls the handle

on the door to the next car. It is stuck. He struggles with it. A LADY

sitting alone inside turns to look at him. She seems threatened by his

effort. He motions for her to help. She turns away.

A look of disgust crosses JACOB's face. He kicks the door. It slides

open. The WOMAN seems frightened as he approaches her.

JACOB walks to the other end of the car and sits down. The only other

passenger is an OLD MAN lying asleep on the fiberglass bench.

Occasionally his body shudders. It is the only sign of life in him.

The train begins to slow down. JACOB peers out of the window. Nostrand

Avenue signs appear. He is relieved. He gets up and grabs hold of the

overhead bar.

The OLD MAN shudders and stretches out on the seat. As he adjusts his

position, tugging at his coat, JACOB catches a brief glimpse of

something protruding from beneath the coat's hem. His eyes fixate on

the spot, waiting for another look. There is a slight movement and it

appears - a long, red, fleshy protuberance. The sight of it sends

shivers up JACOB's spine. It looks strangely like a tail. Only the

stopping of the train breaks JACOB's stare.

INT.  SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT

JACOB is the only passenger getting off. The doors close quickly behind

him. He glances at the LADY sitting by the window. There is a fearful

expression on her face as the train carries her back into the dark

tunnel, out of his sight.

JACOB reaches the exit, a huge metal revolving door surrounded by floor

to ceiling gates. He is about to push when he notices a chain locking

it shut. He stares at it in disbelief.

He turns in a huff and hikes to the other end of the platform. As he

approaches the far exit, his eyes widen. The gate there is also locked.

His hands reach for his hips as he studies an impossible situation.

CUT TO JACOB stepping cautiously onto the ladder going down to the

tracks. A rat scampers by and he gasps.

He starts to climb back up the ladder but sees that there is nowhere

else to go. He juts out his jaw and steps back down.

JACOB is not comfortable on the tracks. He cannot see where he is

stepping. His shoes slpash in unseen liquid which makes him grimace.

The steel girders are coated in subway grime. The oily substance coats

his hands as he reaches for support.

He wipes the grime on his postal uniform as he steps toward the center

track. He reaches for another girder when it begins to vibrate. Two

pinpoints of light hurl toward him. Then the noise arrives confirming

his fear. A train is bearing down on him. JACOB looks frightened, not

sure which way to go. He steps forward, up to his ankle in slime. He

cannot tell which track the train is on. It is moving at phenomenal

speed. The station is spinning. The train's lights merge into one

brilliant intensity.

In near panic JACOB jumps across the track as the train spins by. Its

velocity blows his hair straight up as though it is standing on end. He

clings to a pillar for support, gasping in short breaths.

A few PEOPLE are staring at JACOB from the train. Their faces, pressed

up against the glass, seem deformed. A lone figure waves at him from

the rear window. The train bears them all away. Then it is quiet again.

For a moment JACOB is afraid to move but slowly regains his composure.

He continues to the other side of the tracks and stumbles up the ladder

to the UPTOWN PLATFORM.

JACOB smiling. The smile, however, is one of irony, not amusement. This

exit too is locked. A heavy chain is wrapped through the bars. JACOB

stares at it with an expression of total bewilderment.

A sudden muffled scream alerts JACOB that he is not alone. His head

turns but sees no one. He hears the scream again. He senses its

direction and walks toward the MEN'S ROOM. A crack of light appears

under the door. He can hear someone moaning inside. JACOB knocks softly

and the moaning stops. The lights click off.

There is no answer. JACOB stands silently for a moment, not sure what

to do. He can hear whispering. He chews his lower lip nervously and

then reaches for the door. It pushes open.

The light from the station penetrates the darkness. He gasps. He sees a

MAN tied naked to the stall with ANOTHER NAKED MAN grabbing quickly for

his clothes. The BOUND MAN screams.

A THIRD MAN spins out of the shadows, pointing a kinfe at JACOB's

throat.

The MAN's face is barely human. Before JACOB can even react the door

slams shut. The lock engages. The crack of light reappears. JACOB can

hear laughter coming from inside, followed by a scream. He backs away

from the door. His face is white.

JACOB turns with full fury and storms the gate. The chain gives wayto

his anger. It flies apart and the gate flings open. He stands in

amazement, observing the chain as it slides from between the bars and

drops to the concrete below. The gate squeaks loudly as JACOB pushes it

aside and clangs with an almost painful burst as he slams it shut.

EXT.  WILMINGTON TOWERS - DAWN

JACOB walks toward the towering shadows of a massive PUBLIC HOUSING

PROJECT. It is dark and the moonlight silhouettes the huge monolithic

structures. JACOB passes through a vast COURTYARD dominated by the

imposing shapes. Aside from his moving body everything is still.

INT.  HALLWAY - DAWN

JACOB steps off a graffiti-festooned ELEVATOR into a long impersonal

hallway. He uses three keys to unlock the door to his APARTMENT.

INT.  JACOB'S APT. - DAWN

JACOB enters the darkness without turning on the light. He tries to

navigate his way to the BATHROOM, illuminated by a tiny nightlight in

the distance. His effort is unsuccessful. He bangs loudly into a table.

A WOMAN"s voice calls out.

JACOB crashes into it. A light suddenly goes on. JEZEBEL "JEZZIE"

PIPKIN, 33, is standing in the BEDROOM door tying a man's terrycloth

bathrobe around her waist. Although sleepy, disheveled, and not looking

her best, it is obvious that JEZZIE is a beefy woman, juicy and

sensual.

He pushes himself up.

JACOB steps into the BATHROOM and pulls at his clothes, leaving them in

a pile on the floor. He reaches for the faucet and sends a stream of

water pouding against the porcelain tub. JEZZIE enjoys JACOB's

nakedness. She reaches out to his chest and squeezes one of his

nipples. His body tenses slightly. JEZZIE drops her robe. They enter

the shower together.

EXT.  VIETNAM - NIGHT

A DENSE RAIN falls on a dark night filling puddles of water. JACOB is

crawling through the underbrush in the Vietnamese JUNGLE. His shirt is

bloodsoaked. He moves slowly, creeping on his right forearm. His left

arm is holding his intestines from spilling onto the grass.

Suddenly a flashlight beam can be seen in the distance. It dances

around the bamboo trees and draws closer to JACOB. It is impossible to

see who is carrying it. The light darts near the ground where JACOB is

lying and then bursts directly into his eyes.

INT.  JACOB'S APT. - DAY

SUNLIGHT pours through the BEDROOM window. JACOB is sleeping fitfully

as a bar of light saturates his face. His hand rushes up to cover and

protect his eyes but the damage is done. He is awake.

JACOB lies in bed for a few moments, dazed. Slowly his hand gropes

along the shelf at the head of the bed, searching for his glasses. He

has trouble finding them. As his hand sweeps blindly across the

headboard it hits the telephone and sends it crashing to the floor. He

sits up with a disgusted look on his face and searches the out-of-focus

shelf behind him. Suddenly JEZZIE enters.

She leaves and returns moments later with his glasses and a large paper

bag. She tosses them both onto the bed.

JACOB lifts the bag and pours the photographs onto the bed. There are

hundreds of them. He examines them with growing delight.

He digs through more photos. Suddenly he stops.

To JEZZIE's surprise and his own, tears well up in his eyes. For a

moment JACOB is unable to speak. He just stares at one of the photos.

JEZZIE looks at the picture. It is an image of JACOB carrying a small

child on his shoulders.

JEZZIE is silent. JACOB grabs a Kleenex and blows his nose.

Hiding his emotions, JACOB scrambles over the bed and reaches for a

pair of pants. He pulls out his wallet and then carefully puts the

photo of GABE inside. It joins photos of his two other boys. JEZZIE

begins shoving the remaining pictures back into the paper bag.

He reaches into the pile for other snapshots. We see an array of frozen

moments, happy, unfocused, obscure. Suddenly he stops and stares at a

yellowing snapshot.

JEZZIE surveys the scene.

INT.  HALLWAY - DAY

JEZZIE carries the garbage to an INCINERATOR ROOM down the hall. She is

carrying several bags. Two of them are tossed instantly down the chute.

She hesitates with the third. After a moment she reaches into it and

pulls out a handful of photos. They are pictures of JACOB and SARAH.

With cool deliberation she drops them down the chute. An apartment door

slams shut. Quickly she disposes of the pictures remaining in her hand.

JACOB opens the door to the tiny room as the bag filled with the

memories of his life falls to the fire below.

JACOB and JEZZIE, both wearing postal uniforms, head for the ELEVATOR.

They are surprised that it has arrived promptly. JEZZIE reaches out and

playfully sticks her tongue into JACOB's ear. He pulls her into the

ELEVATOR. They disappear, laughing, behind its closing doors.

EXT.  NEW YORK CITY - DAY

JACOB is driving a mail truck through the crowded streets of midtown

Manhattan. As he drives he is humming to himself a rendition of Al

Jolson's "Sonny Boy."

JACOB stops his truck in front of a LAUNDRY on West 46th Street. He

opens the back door and pulls a stack of boxes toward him. He lifts

them with effort and slams the door with his foot. It doesn't close. He

considers giving it another whack but the boxes are heavy. He turns

instead and waddles toward the store.

INT.  LAUNDRY - DAY

A heavyset WOMAN with a dark tan is standing behind a counter cluttered

with laundry. A picture of Richard Nixon is still stapled to the wall.

She looks at JACOB.

She tries clearing the counter, but it doesn't help.

JACOB waddles reluctantly toward the back of the store. CHINESE

LAUNDERERS are hovering over piles of clothes. Steam from the pressing

machines shoots into the air.

JACOB stoops to put the boxes on the shelf. There is a snapping sound

and he winces in pain. Massaging his back, JACOB unfolds some papers

for the WOMAN's signature.

She hands JACOB the wrong sheet.

JACOB smiles to himself as he leaves the store. He walks carefully. His

back is out.

INT.  MAIL TRUCK - DAY

ANGLE ON THE MAIL TRUCK stuck in traffic. Nothing is moving. Horns are

blaring and drivers are agitated. JACOB reaches for a newspaper lying

on top of his mail bags. To his shock one of the bags appears to move.

Curious, JACOB pokes at it. Instantly a terrifying figure pops out from

beneath it and stares at him with a frightening glare. JACOB jumps

back, stunned. It is a moment before he realizes that he is looking at

an old WINO who has been sleeping in the truck. The man's face is

covered in strange bumps.

He begins opening the door. The WINO begs.

He holds on to JACOB's leg. JACOB tries to pull away.

JACOB gives the WINO a strange look and then escorts him from the

truck. A hundred eyes peer out of motionless cars and follow him as he

leads the WINO to the sidewalk. JACOB pulls a dollar bill from his

pocket and places it in the WINO's hand. The OLD MAN crumples it into a

ball and turns away. He has a frightened look on his face. JACOB

returns to the truck shaking his head.

He climbs into his seat and glances into his rear view mirror. He

notices the WINO edging fearfully along the side of a building. A horn

honks and traffic begins moving. When JACOB looks back the WINO is no

longer there.

INT.  GARAGE - DAY

JACOB drives his mail truck into the huge POST OFFICE PARKING GARAGE on

34th Street. His mind seems distracted. He has difficulty parking.

INT.  POST OFFICE - DAY

We see a vast room filled with hundreds of PEOPLE sorting and moving

mail.

JACOB, carrying a bag of McDonald's hamburgers, walks stiffly through

the aisles, his left hand rubbing his back. Several workers greet him

and grab for his french fries. He offers them around.

ANGLE ON a conveyor belt sorting mail. A hand reaches in, correcting

mistakes. Suddenly a hamburger passes by. JEZZIE looks up and smiles.

She takes the hamburger and shrugs.

JACOB shrugs.

She grabs him and hugs him tightly.

JEZZIE ignores him and squeezes again.

INT.  CHIROPRACTIC OFFICE - DAY

CUT ON A SCREAM to JACOB in a CHIROPRACTOR'S OFFICE. He is lying on a

long leather padded device that looks like an instrument of torture.

LOUIS, the Chiropractor, is a giant of a man, 280 pounds. He is

adjusting JACOB's spine.

He makes a rapid adjustment pushing down on JACOB's thigh. JACOB

groans.

He makes an adjustment. JACOB screams.

JACOB wiggles his toes. At that instant, LOUIS twists JACOB's neck

rapidly. There is a loud cracking sound.

EXT.  VIETNAM - NIGHT

THERE IS A FLASH OF LIGHT. A MAN rushes at the camera yelling.

He shines a flashlight into the lens creating rings and halos.

CHIROPRACTIC OFFICE - DAY

Suddenly LOUIS reappears, a halo effect still visible behind his head.

EXT.  BROOKLYN STREETS - EVENING

JACOB is walking down Nostrand Avenue. He is singing to himself and

imitating Al Jolson.

He hums. It is near dusk and lights are just coming on. The shop

windows have a particularly garish look about them. The mannequins are

dressed in inexpensive, almost tawdry, clothes and have a pathetic

appearance. A few shops have set up their Christmas decorations.

The ornamentation seems strangely out of place; almost blasphemous.

JACOB passes a street gang standing in the doorway of a local drug

store. They chortle and make taunting sounds.

JACOB stops and stares at them. To their surprise, he begins to sing

with them. He knows the words. They like that. It is a sweet moment.

JACOB continues walking. He comes to a cross street. The light is

green. He is still singing to himself and does not notice a BLACK CAR

sharging around the corner. The car is moving at full speed, heading

straight toward him. A YOUNG MAN walking a few steps behind yells out.

JACOB turns and sees the car. He scoots out of the way but it swerves

in his direction. The YOUNG MAN calls out again.

With a huge thrust, JACOB hurls himself onto the curb as the car shoots

by. Two MEN are peering at him from the back seat. They are laughing

like madmen and shaking their heads. They do not look human. JACOB

yells and waves his fist, to no effect. After a moment he turns to

thank the YOUNG MAN whose scream had saved him, but he is gone.

INT.  JACOB'S APT. - DUSK

JACOB and JEZZIE are lying in bed. They are a sensual couple and even

in quiet, reflective moments such as this, their positioning is erotic

and stimulating. Both of them are nude. JACOB's hands are clasped

behind his neck and he is staring mournfully at the ceiling. JEZZIE is

lying on her side, her left leg draped across JACOB's pelvis. Her head

is propped up on her right arm while her left hand strokes the bayonet

scar on JACOB's stomach. Neither are talking. Suddenly, out of the

blue, JEZZIE speaks.

She pauses for a while, long enough to suppose that the conversation is

over. Then she continues.

JACOB closes his eyes.

JACOB doesn't answer. He turns over on his stomach. JEZZIE stares at

his naked back and drags her fingernails down to his buttocks. Scratch

marks follow in their wake.

He does not respond.

INT.  JACOB'S KITCHEN - DAY

JACOB and JEZZIE are sitting at the breakfast table. JEZZIE is reading

the National Enquirer and chewing at her lip. Suddenly a drop of blood

forms and falls onto the formica table top. Staring at it for a moment,

she wipes it with her finger and then licks it with her tongue.

JACOB is nursing a cup of coffee and staring out the window at the

housing project across the way. The toaster pops. JEZZIE jumps. She

gets up, butters her toast, and returns to her paper.

JACOB doesn't answer.

He does not respond. JEZZIE gets up and walks over to JACOB. Standing

in front of him she slowly unties her robe and lets it fall apart. She

is naked underneath it. Sensuously she leans forward, unbuttons his

shirt, and strokes his chest. She waits for a response from him, but

there is none. He sits silently, disinterested.

Furious, JEZZIE turns away. Grabbing the vacuum cleaner from the broom

closet she angrily unravels the cord and switches it on. Breasts flash

from beneath her gown as the vacuum roars back and forth across the

floor.

A NEIGHBOR bangs on the wall, shouting.

JACOB peers at the courtyard eighteen stories below and watches the

patterns of early morning movement. Tiny figures drift purposefully

over the concrete.

Suddenly the vasuum cleaner goes off. In the silence, JACOB realizes

that JEZZIE is crying and turns to see her curled over the kitchen

table. He walks to her side and strokes her hair. JEZZIE begins to sob.

After a moment she looks at him with puffy eyes.

He nods his head "yes." She smiles coyly and rubs her hair like a

kitten against his crotch. After a few moments she speaks.

He nods his head again, only heavily, as though the question exhausts

him.

INT.  BELLVUE HOSPITAL - DAY

JACOB is in the "Mental Health Clinic" at BELLVUE HOSPITAL walking

through the PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCY ROOM. It is overflowing with people.

Some are handcuffed to their chairs. POLICEMEN are with them. JACOB

approaches the main RECEPTION DESK. He speaks nervously.

She shrugs and looks at a log book.

She walks over to a file drawer and goes through it several times

before coming back over to JACOB.

JACOB pounds the desk, rattling a tiny African violet and knocking the

RECEPTIONIST's forms to the floor. She grunts angrily and stoops to

retrieve them. Standing up her cap hits a drawer handle and slips off.

TWO KNUCKLE-LIKE HORNS protrude from her skull where the cap had been.

JACOB's eyes lock on them like radar. He backs away. She immediately

replaces her cap and breaks the spell, but her eyes glare at him with

demonic intensity. JACOB, freaked, angry, turns and runs toward the "In

Patient" door.

JACOB doesn't stop. A POLICEMAN, guarding the entrance, runs after him.

JACOB charges through the interior corridors of the aging institution.

A LINE OF MENTAL PATIENTS, all holding hands, is moving down the hall.

They break ranks as he charges by and begin to scream. Their ATTENDANT

tries to calm them down but the sight of the POLICEMAN increases their

hysteria. They grab hold of him as he tries to get by.

INT.  GROUP ROOM - DAY

JACOB dashes out of view. He runs down another corridor, wildly

searching for a specific room. He finds it and rushes inside. He is

surprised to find A GROUP OF MEN AND WOMEN seated in a circle. They all

look up at him.

The LEADER stares at him uncomfortably. After a moment he gets up and

takes JACOB into a corner of the room. Everyone is watching them. The

LEADER speaks quietly.

The LEADER shrugs and tries to put his arm around JACOB, but he pulls

away.

He backs quickly to the door. As he turns to leave he realizes that all

of the PEOPLE in the group are watching him intently.

Unsettled, JACOB hurries back into the hallway. He is frightened and

confused. Suddenly a voice calls out.

JACOB turns and sees the POLICEMAN waiting for him. His gun is drawn.

The GROUP LEADER pokes his head out of the door and motions to the

POLICEMAN.

He leads JACOB toward the lobby. JACOB does not look back.

INT.  DELLA'S APT. - NIGHT

WE HEAR LOUD DANCE MUSIC. SLY AND THE FAMILY STONE. JACOB is with some

POST OFFICE EMPLOYEES at a crowded party in a small apartment. A DRUNK

is telling a bad joke and trying to hold a glass of wine at the same

time. It is constantly on the verge of spilling. JACOB is fixated on

it. In the background, we see JEZZIE dancing and motioning for JACOB to

join her. He nods no. The DRUNK, who keeps asking people if they "get

it," takes JACOB's head nodding as a sign of confusion and keeps trying

to re-explain the joke.

JACOB hears a strange noise and looks around. It seems to be coming

from a covered bird cage. He goes over to it and lifts the cover. The

BIRD is flapping its wings wildly as if trying to get out. The sound,

loud and insistent, startles him. He lowers the cover.

In the DINING ROOM, several people are gathered around ELSA, an

attractive black woman who is reading palms. She sees JACOB and calls

over the music.

JACOB shrugs. DELLA, dancing nearby, calls out.

CUT TO A CLOSE UP OF JACOB'S HAND. ELSA is squeezing the mounds and

examining the lines. What begins as a playful expression on her face

turns suddenly serious. She reaches for his other hand and compares the

two of them. JEZZIE looks over from her dancing and eyes the scene

jealously.

She studies his life line with growing concern. JEZZIE tries to get

JACOB's attention. He ignores her.

THE DANCERS. Their movements are loose and getting looser. The music is

strong and insistent. The smokey atmosphere disfigures the dancers and

gives them a strange, distorted appearance. Suddenly JEZZIE breaks from

the crowd and reaches for JACOB. He pulls away. Some of the MALE

DANCERS call out to him.

JACOB is easily intimidated. Relenting, he glares at JEZZIE and nods

apologetically to ELSA. It is obvious that he is embarrassed at his

inadequacy on the dance floor.

JACOB tries to smile but it is pained and unconvincing. JEZZIE is

playing with him, mimicking his movement. A number of DANCERS notice

and laugh, which only increases his discomfort. JEZZIE's taunting has a

strange effect on JACOB. He grows distant and withdrawn, even though

his body is still going through the motions of the dance.

A MAN taps JEZZIE on the shoulder. She spins around, smiling, and

begins dancing with him. JACOB is left alone, dancing by himself. He

looks away, uncomfortable.

In the shadows a WOMAN kneels close to the floor. She seems to be

urinating on the carpet. JACOB is shocked. Several DANCERS obscure his

view. He turns around.

A PREGNANT WOMAN stands half naked in the kitchen. JACOB cannot believe

what he sees.

In the next room, past JEZZIE, JACOB glimpses a terrifying image, a MAN

whose head seems to be vibrating at such enormous speed that it has

lost all definition. Something about the image compels and frightens

JACOB. Slowly he approaches it. As he draws nearer to it the tortured

image lets out a scream of such pain and unearthly terror that JACOB

backs away.

A WOMAN, laughing, grabs JACOB, spins him around, and begins dancing

with him. He is totally disoriented.

She takes JACOB's arm and guides it to her back. THE CAMERA follows his

hand as it reaches the smooth skin beneath her sexy, loose fitting

dress. He runs his fingers up to her shoulder blades. Then, suddenly,

he recoils. Her back is a mass of shoulder blades, hundreds of strange,

bony protrusions. JACOB gasps. Out of the blue, JEZZIE leans into him

and wiggles her tongue in his ear. JACOB, startled, jerks his head and

his glasses go flying to the floor.

He stoops down blindly to pick them up. Shoes just miss his fingers as

he digs between dancing legs trying to recover them. Miraculously, he

grabs the spectacles just before they are crushed and slips them back

on. Instantly his world comes back into focus.

As he stands, JACOB is surprised to find JEZZIE facing him, gyrating in

wild abandon. There is a huge, satisfied smile on her face. She grabs

his hand as if encouraging him to dance but it is obvious that she is

dancing to her own rhythm. JACOB stares at her, confused. It takes him

a moment to realize that her smile is not for him.

Standing behind JEZZIE is another DANCER, his hands around her waist.

They are moving together, locked in erotic embrace. It appears that he

is mounting her from behind. Looking down we see that the DANCER's feet

are deformed. They have a bizarre clubbed appearance and look very much

like hooves. They skid and careen amidst the dancing feet.

Something horrible and winglike flaps behind JEZZIE's back. We cannot

make out what it is, but it elicits a primal terror. Before JACOB can

react, JEZZIE opens her mouth. With a roaring sound, a spiked horn

erupts from her throat. It juts menacingly from between her teeth and

thrusts into the air. A CIRCLE OF DANCERS scream out in excited

approval.

CUT TO JACOB's face as it registers terror and disbelief. He stares at

the DANCERS who are crowding around him. They have become perverse,

corrupt aspects of their normal selves.

JACOB grabs his eyes as though trying to pull the vision from his head

but it won't go away. The music throbs. His actions become spastic,

almost delirious.

JACOB is out of control. His frenzy becomes a kind of exorcism, a

desperate attempt to free himself from his body and his mind. WE MOVE

IN ON HIM as his eyes pass beyond pain. The dark walls of the APARTMENT

fade away.

EXT.  VIETNAM - NIGHT

Strange faces in infantry helmets appear in the darkness, outlined by a

bright moon that is emerging from behind a cloud. The faces are looking

down and voices are speaking.

His eyes focus on the moon. Rings of light emenate from it filling the

sky with their sparkling brilliance. The rings draw us forward with a

quickening intensity that grows into exhilarating speed. The rush

causes them to flash stroboscopically and produces a dazzling, almost

sensual, surge of color. The display is spectacular and compelling.

Music can be heard in the distance, growing hard and insistent, like a

heart beat. Heavy breathing accompanies the sound. The stroboscopic

flashes are replaced by intense flashes of red and blue light. The

music grows louder and reaches a thundering crescendo. Then silence.

INT.  DELLA'S APT. - NIGHT

The APARTMENT reappears in all its normalcy. The neon sign is still

flashing outside the window. DANCERS are smiling and sweating.

Cheers and applause ring out for JACOB and JEZZIE but JACOB barely

hears them. JEZZIE hugs him tightly. PEOPLE smack him on the back.

JEZZIE smiles while pulling JACOB to a corner chair. He plops down. His

chest is heaving and he is grabbing hold of his stomach. Hie face is

frightened and distorted.

JACOB eyes her with a pleading look. Annoyed, JEZZIE leaves JACOB and

crosses the room. He watches her as she goes. JACOB is holding his

stomach and rocking painfully. Moments later JEZZIE returns with DELLA.

Suddenly JACOB breaks out in a dense sweat and begins shaking. His

entire body is convulsive.

JACOB is shaking uncontrollably. People are gathering around.

She reaches out to JACOB. Unexpectedly he recoils, jumping to his feet

like a wild man. He begins to scream.

JEZZIE stares at JACOB with a confused and embarrassed look. A MAN

whispers to her.

INT.  JACOB'S APT. - NIGHT

JACOB is lying in bed in his own BEDROOM with a thermometer in his

mouth. JEZZIE is pacing the floor with great agitation.

The NEIGHBOR pounds on the wall.

JEZZIE jabs her finger at the wall.

JEZZIE reaches for his mouth and pulls out the thermometer. She looks

at it closely and then squints to see it better.

She runs out of the room. JACOB calls after her.

JEZZIE is on the phone to the doctor in the next room.

JACOB begins shaking again and reaches for the extra blanket at the

foot of the bed. He pulls it up around his shoulders. The whole bed

vibrates with his shivering. Suddenly JEZZIE rushes through the BEDROOM

and into the BATHROOM. SHe turns on the bath water.

JACOB gives her a confused look as she rushes back to the KITCHEN.

JACOB stares at her as she bursts back into the BEDROOM carrying four

trays of ice cubes. She hurries into the BATHROOM and dumps them in the

tub.

She rushes out of the BATHROOM and pulls JACOB out of bed. He is

shaking violently and she has difficulty navigating across the room and

undressing him at the same time. She maneuvers him into the BATHROOM

next to the tub. He looks down at the ice cubes floating in the water.

She runs out of the room. The door to the apartment slams shut. JACOB

sticks his toe into the water and pulls it out again instantly.

He sticks his whole foot in and grits his teeth as the ice cold water

turns his foot bright red. He keeps it in as long as he can and then

yanks it out, quickly wrapping it in a towel. JACOB rubs his foot

vigorously to get rid of the sting and stares at the water, afraid of

its pain.

INT.  CORRIDOR - NIGHT

JEZZIE is running up and down the CORRIDOR knocking on doors and

collecting ice cubes from those who will answer. She hurries back to

the BATHROOM with several PEOPLE behind her carrying additional ice

trays. One of the MEN is shifting the trays in his hands to avoid the

burning cold.

INT.  JACOB'S BATHROOM

As JEZZIE enters the BATHROOM, JACOB is sitting on the rim of the tub

with the water up to his calves, shivering vigorously.

She unloads two trays into the water.

SAM and TONY grab hold of JACOB who wrestles to get away.

The TWO MEN struggle with JACOB and force him into the water. TONY

winces when the water hits his arm. JACOB nearly flies out of the tub.

The TWO MEN fight to hold him down. JACOB screams and cries for the MEN

to let him go but they keep him flat on his back.

MRS. CARMICHAEL comes in.

TONY helps her pour the ice into the water. JACOB yells.

INT.  A BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO JACOB lying in a BEDROOM we have not seen before. He is tossing

and turning in his bed as though struggling to get out. Suddenly he

sits up and looks over at the window. It is open and the shade is

flapping. Cold air is blowing in and he is shivering.

He jumps out of bed and goes over to the window. He pushes at the frame

and it comes flying down with a loud bang. A woman in the bed sits up.

It is SARAH.

He settles back into bed and pulls the covers back over to his side. He

lies quietly for a moment, thinking.

Suddenly, out of nowhere, we hear the tinkling sound of a music box. A

YOUNG BOY enters the room, carrying a musical LUNCH BOX in his arms. He

is wearing a long T-shirt nearly down to his ankles. We recognize him

from his photograph. It is GABE.

She starts to rise. JACOB stops her and gets up instead. He whisks GABE

upside down and carries him into his

GABE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

BEDROOM, licking his belly and tickling him all the way. GABE laughs

and snuggles into his pillow as soon as he hits the bed. JED, 9, and

ELI, 7, are both in bunk beds across the room. JED looks up.

Suddenly another voice pipes in from the top bunk.

JACOB smiles.

He turns to leave.

He hugs him warmly and then walks to the door.

There is deep emotion and seriousness in GABE's words. JACOB is struck

by them.

JACOB nods and leaves it a tiny bit ajar.

JACOB adjusts the opening enough to please GABE and make him secure.

GABE smiles and cuddles in his bed.

INT.  SARAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

JACOB settles back into bed. SARAH turns over and gets comfortable.

JACOB lies on his back facing the ceiling. He pulls the blankets up to

his neck. He is overcome with feelings of sadness and longing.

She smiles warmly. His eyes close and in a matter of seconds he is back

asleep.

EXT.  VIETNAM - PRE DAWN

WE HEAR SUMMER MORNING SOUNDS, CRICKETS and BIRDS. The image of trees

materializes overhead and a beautiful pink sky, just before sunrise,

can be seen through the branches. It is an idyllic setting.

Suddenly a strange sound can be heard in the distance, a metallic

humming, growing louder. There is a scramble of feet and a sound of

heavy boots moving through the tall grass. Voices can be heard. Men's

voices.

There is an instant swell of activity. Trees and branches blur and

speed by overhead. The idyllic image of moments before reveals itself

as a P.O.V. SHOT. The CAMERA races out of a JUNGLE covering and into a

huge CLEARING.

High overhead a helicopter appears. Its blades whirl with a deafening

whine. Long lines drop from its belly and dangle in mid-air. SOLDIERS

leap up into the air reaching for them. The air is filled with

turbulence. Tarps fly off dead bodies. SOLDIERS hold them down. Voices

yell but the words are not clear. They are filled with urgency.

The CAMERA leaves the ground. The edges of the sky disappear as the

helicopter's gray mass fills the frame. It grows larger and darker as

the CAMERA approaches. Rivets and insignias dotting the underbelly come

into view. Suddenly the stretcher begins spinning, out of control.

Hands emerge from inside, reaching out to grab it.

Watery, womb-like sounds rise out of nowhere, the rippling of water, a

heart beating. Gradually voices can be heard mumbling; distant sounds,

warm and familiar.

INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT

JACOB's DOCTOR reaches down to help him out of the tub. Surprisingly

JEZZIE and MRS. CARMICHAEL are standing there too. JACOB stares at them

in total confusion.

SAM and TONY appear next to the DOCTOR. They are extending their hands

to the P.O.V. CAMERA. JACOB'S arms, nearly blue, reach out to them.

Slowly they lift him from the icy water. JACOB takes one step onto the

tile and collapses to the floor.

INT.  JACOB'S BEDROOM - DAY

FADE IN sounds of feet shuffling across the carpet. A glass rattles on

a tray. A television is on low in the background. Slowly the CAMERA

LENS opens from JACOB's P.O.V. and we see JEZZIE puttering around the

BEDROOM. Suddenly she is aware that JACOB is watching her. She smiles.

JEZZIE leaves the room. JACOB watches her as she goes. He seems lost

and confused.

INT.  JACOB'S KITCHEN - DAY

JACOB, unshaven, wearing his bathrobe, is sitting at the KITCHEN TABLE.

PILES OF BOOKS on demonology are spread out before him. He studies them

to distraction. JEZZIE is standing by the counter making sandwiches.

She wraps them in plastic Baggies and puts one in a lunch box, another

in the refrigerator. She is dressed in her postal uniform.

JEZZIE just stares at him. She does not respond. JACOB returns to his

books.

CUT TO CLOSE UP IMAGES OF WINGED DEMONS, real demons, with spindly

horns and long tails. JACOB's huge finger, magnified, scans page after

page of ancient images and archaic text. JEZZIE, enraged at his lack of

attention, returns to packing her lunch box. Suddenly she spins around.

CUT BACK to the DEMONS. Suddenly a crashing sound catches JACOB's

attention as a KITCHEN POT flies by his head. He looks up to see JEZZIE

knocking pots and pans off the kitchen counter and kicking them wildly

across the room. The noise is terrible. The intensity of her rage is

shocking. The pots crash into every surface, knocking all his books

onto the floor. And then, suddenly, she stops.

JEZZIE stoops down to the floor and picks up her sandwich, stuffs it

back in its plastic Baggie, and puts it back in her lunch box. She is

about to leave when she stops and looks at JACOB.

JEZZIE sits on his lap, gives him a big kiss, and then, unexpectedly,

raises two fingers, like horns, over her head. The gesture catches

JACOB's full attention.

Suddenly the telephone rings. It startles them.

JEZZIE grabs her jacket and shoves her arm in it upside down. A

pocketful of change falls on the floor. JACOB smiles. JEZZIE curses as

she struggles to pick it up and get the jacket on right. JACOB gets the

phone.

JACOB indicates it's for him. JEZZIE throws him a kiss goodbye and

hurries out the door.

INT.  PAUL'S CAR - DAY

JACOB and PAUL are driving through EAST NEW YORK heading toward

WILLIAMSBURG. The elevated trains rumble above them. JACOB pats PAUL on

the back.

PAUL looks in his rear view mirror before changing lanes. He sees a

black car tagging close behind him. He pulls out. So does the car.

JACOB notices PAUL's left arm. It is shaking. The black car passes on

the left. Both PAUL and JACOB stare at it as it speeds by.

INT.  BAR - DAY

JACOB and PAUL are sitting in a dark booth in an obscure WILLIAMSBURG

BAR. It is nearly empty. PAUL is leaning across the table in a very

intimate fashion.

JACOB nods. PAUL takes a sip of his drink and stares deliberately into

JACOB's eyes.

JACOB's face grows suddenly tense.

PAUL cannot contain his fear. He jumps up suddenly and walks away from

the booth. JACOB follows him with his eyes but does not go after him. A

YOUNG MAN in the next booth observes the scene with interest. He looks

vaguely familiar, like we have seen him before.

PAUL stares out the window for a moment and then walks over to the juke

box. He pulls a quarter out of his pocket and drops it in the slot. His

finger pushes a selection at random. Some '60's rock hit blares out.

JACOB's mind is reeling by the time PAUL sits back down.

PAUL's hand starts to shake. The tremor spreads rapidly to his whole

body. The booth begins to rattle.

JACOB slides quickly out of his side of the booth and moves in toward

PAUL. He puts his arm around him and holds him tightly, offering

comfort as best he can.

PAUL is obviously terrified and grateful for JACOB's gesture. A few

PEOPLE at the bar look over in their direction.

JACOB leans back in the booth, his mind racing. The YOUNG MAN in the

next booth is watching them with rapt attention.

INT.  MEN'S ROOM - DAY

PAUL and JACOB are in the MEN'S ROOM. PAUL flushes the urinal.

PAUL smiles.

EXT.  BAR - DAY

The TWO MEN leave the bar on a dingy side street. It is cold outside.

Christmas lights seem ludicrous dangling in the bar's front window.

PAUL looks at them and smiles.

PAUL steps into the street and walks to the driver's side of his car.

He pulls out his keys and opens the door. JACOB looks down on the

sidewalk and notices a dime.

He bends down to pick it up. PAUL inserts the key into the ignition and

steps on the gas. He turns the key.

THE CAR EXPLODES. Pieces of metal and flesh fly into the air. JACOB

sprawls out flat on the ground as the debris hurls above him. He covers

his head.

EXT.  VIETNAM

CUT TO A HELICOPTER suffering an air bombardment. Flack is exploding

all around it and the shock waves are rocking the craft violently.

JACOB's eyes peer to the left.

INFANTRY GUNNERS are firing rockets into the JUNGLE below. A pair of

MEDICS are huddled over him. A sudden gush of arterial bleeding sends a

stream of blood splattering over the inside of the windshield. The

PILOT, unable to see, clears it away with his hands.

JACOB screams over the roar of the chopper. One of the MEDICS presses

his ear close to JACOB to hear.

EXT.  BAR - DAY

THE YOUNG MAN from the bar grabs JACOB under the arms and drags him

down the sidewalk.

The YOUNG MAN yanks JACOB around the corner just as another explosion

consumes the car. The air is filled with flames and flying debris. The

YOUNG MAN pulls JACOB into the bar.

The CUSTOMERS are in a state of bedlam. Part of the wall has blown

apart and bricks and glass are everywhere. The cross from around PAUL's

neck is buried in the debris. Sirens are heard in the distance. A BLACK

CAR speeds off down the street. JACOB looks for the YOUNG MAN who had

helped him. He is gone.

EXT.  FUNERAL PROCESSION - DAY

A FUNERAL PROCESSION heads down Ocean Parkway.

INT.  JACOB'S CAR - DAY

JACOB and JEZZIE are driving in an old Chevy Nova. They are dressed up.

JACOB's face is bruised and he has a gauze pad over his ear. They drive

in silence. JACOB appears very sad. Slowly his right hand reaches

across the seat, seeking JEZZIE's. Their fingers embrace.

EXT.  CEMETERY - DAY

The FUNERAL PROCESSION enters the CEMETERY. Cars park along the length

of the narrow road. MEN IN DARK SUITS emerge from their cars along with

WIVES and GIRLFRIENDS.

They are the SOLDIERS we have seen at the opening of the film, only

they are older now. A small group of FAMILY MEMBERS are helped to the

graveside.

JACOB joins the other VETERANS as pallbearers. They carry the casket in

semi-military formation to the grave.

INT.  PAUL'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

JACOB'S OLD ARMY BUDDIES are sitting together in Paul's living room,

talking. PAUL'S WIFE can be seen in the BEDROOM. Several WOMEN are

comforting her.

JEZZIE is talking to a small group of LADIES in the DINING ROOM and

nibbling off a tray of cold cuts. PAUL'S SISTER is with her and they

seem to be having a lively, almost intimate, conversation.

JACOB and his BUDDIES are drinking beer. They all have a tired,

defeated look about them.

The statement has a surprising impact on the group. There is immediate

silence and eyes averted from one another.

He notices GEORGE's beer can rattling.

GEORGE tries to smile as he hurries to the bathroom. His arm is nearly

out of control and beer is spilling on the carpet as he walks.

No one laughs. There is an uncomfortable silence.

EXT.  A BACK ALLEY - DAY

The SIX MEN are walking quietly through an unpaved alley. It is already

gray and getting darker.

He hesitates. They all understand.

INT.  LAW OFFICE - DAY

JACOB, FRANK, JERRY, GEORGE, DOUG, and ROD are sitting on plush chairs

in the LAW OFFICE of DONALD GEARY. GEARY, a red-faced man with three

chins, is sucking on an ice cube. He looks at each of the men, and then

spits the ice cube into an empty glass. It clinks.

GEARY stands up and grabs a bag of Cheetos from a file drawer. He

chomps down a few and offers the bag to the others. There are no

takers. Thirsty, he downs the ice cube and cracks it between his teeth.

The MEN are surprised and excited.

The MEN all nod in agreement.

EXT.  OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

JACOB and the others exit the OFFICE BUILDING. They are jubilant,

clasping hands and smacking each other on the back. We watch as they

break up. JACOB heads for the subway. FRANK and another group hop a

cab. As the cab pulls away we notice that a black car pulls out behind

it. It follows them out of sight.

INT.  JACOB'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

JACOB and JEZZIE are making wild and unadulterated love on the kitchen

floor. The wastebasket flips over. JACOB's hand splashes into the dog's

bowl. Nothing impedes their passion. JEZZIE laughs, hollers, and

swoons. Hands grab hold of table legs. Chairs topple. Feet bang wildly

against the stove. It is all mayhem and ecstacy. And then it ends.

JACOB's face is ecstatic. He can barely talk and simply basks in

JEZZIE's glow. She looks especially lovely and radiant. They lie

exhausted and exhilarated on the linoleum floor.

JEZZIE kisses him softly around his face and gently probes his ear with

her pinky. JACOB loves it.

Silence. Suddenly JEZZIE roars like a monster and scares JACOB half to

death. They laugh and tumble back to the floor.

INT.  JACOB'S APT. - EVENING

JACOB emerges from the bathroom shower and pulls on a robe. JEZZIE is

moving rapidly around the KITCHEN.

JACOB'S APT./FRANK'S APT. - INTERCUT

The door slams securely. The locks set. JACOB begins instantly rifling

through a desk drawer. He comes up with a frayed address book and looks

up a number. He dials.

We see FRANK standing at a window fingering the Venetian blinds. He

does not reply. The scene intercuts between the two men.

FRANK hangs up. JACOB stands holding the phone for a long time, until

the high pitched whine from the receiver reminds him it's off the hook.

The sound frightens him and he slams the receiver down. QUickly JACOB

tears through his address book looking for other phone numbers. They

aren't there.

INT.  JACOB'S APT.

JACOB hurries into the BEDROOM and pulls an old shoe box from the

closet. The box is filled with yellowing army papers, dog tags, and

photos of old comrades. Beneath his discharge papers he finds a sheet

scribbled with the names and addresses of platoon buddies. JACOB grabs

it. Then his eyes fall on the frayed remains of an old letter. He picks

it up and unfolds it with great care. The letter is written in a

child's handwriting. "DEAR DADDY, I LOVE YOU. PLEASE COME HOME. JED GOT

A FROG. ELI LOST MY KEY. MOM WANTS YOU TO SEND HER MONEY. LOVE, GABE."

EXT.  BROOKLYN SIDEWALK - DAY

GABE, on a BICYCLE, is rushing down the sidewalk. JACOB is running

alongside him, holding onto the seat. Plastic streamers trail from the

handlebars. GABE is a bit wobbly, but determined. After a couple of

false starts, JACOB lets go and GABE is riding by himself. For an

instant, GABE looks back at his father with a huge grin on his face.

JACOB is grinning, too. THE CAMERA HOLDS ON GABE as he pulls away from

us and heads into the distance.

INT.  JACOB'S APT. - NIGHT

JACOB swallows hard as he stands there, holding the letter. Suddenly

his eyes lift off the page and glance at a full length mirror mounted

on the bedroom door. Something in the mirror, like the image of a

child, seems to move. He looks over. There is nothing there. Curious,

JACOB walks toward the mirror. As his image appears, he gasps and stops

moving. To his horror and ours, it is his own back that is reflected in

the mirror. The impossibility of the moment startles him. He lifts his

hand. The reflection moves with him. Frightened but defiant, JACOB

moves toward the mirror. The image in the mirror spins around. It is

the  FRIGHTENING VIBRATING FACE he saw at the party with JEZZIE. An

unearthly scream comes from both their mouths.

INT.  BROOKLYN COURT HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

A huge wooden door slams open. JACOB charges through it.

He is chasing his lawyer, DONALD GEARY, through a crowded court house

corridor. GEARY, sweaty and unshaven, is cradling a Coke in one hand, a

sandwich and a briefcase in the other. His stomach bounces wildly as he

walks.

GEARY keeps walking. JACOB catches up to him.

JACOB grabs the back of GEARY's jacket and pulls him up short.

JACOB lets go. He stares into GEARY's eyes.

GEARY gives JACOB a pitiful look.

He turns and walks away. JACOB stands there a moment, and then rushes

after him. GEARY is biting into his sandwich.

Mayonnaise spills onto his hand. He licks it with his tongue. JACOB

catches up to him.

GEARY takes a swig of his COKE and begins walking away. JACOB, enraged,

charges after him. With a wild swipe he sends the COKE CAN shooting out

of GEARY's hand. It reverberates down the corridor. GEARY is stunned.

With a powerful thrust, JACOB rips the sandwich from GEARY's other

hand. Tossing it on the floor, he grinds his heel in it. Tomato and

mayonnaise squirt onto GEARY's shoe. JACOB turns away.

CUT TO JACOB walking down the COURT HOUSE CORRIDOR to the elevators.

There is a look of satisfaction on his face.

CUT BACK TO GEARY. He picks up a telephone and dials. Someone comes on

the line. GEARY speaks quietly.

CUT TO JACOB stepping onto the elevator. The doors close. The Muzak is

playing "Sonny Boy" with Al Jolson singing. JACOB is surprised to hear

it. He presses the down button for the main floor.

The elevator stops at the LOBBY. The doors open swiftly. SEVERAL

SOLDIERS are standing there. They approach JACOB.

JACOB is shocked to see them. He tries to get away but two of the

SOLDIERS yank him toward the LOBBY doors.

INT.  CAR - LATE AFTERNOON

JACOB is hustled to a waiting car and shoved inside, in between two

officious looking MEN. The doors lock from the DRIVER's command.

The car drives off.

JACOB tries to speak but the other MAN grabs his mouth.

JACOB stares at the men for a moment and then goes totally berserk.

Letting out a howl, he begins pounding and thrashing like a madman. He

is totally out of control.

With a wild leap, he grabs for the door handle. The door flies open. It

flaps back and forth, slamming into parked cars. JACOB tries to jump

out, but the men yank him back in. One of them pulls out a gun. JACOB

sees it and goes crazy. His feet kick in all directions, slamming the

DRIVER's nose into the steering wheel and shattering the side window.

The car careens around a corner sending the gun flying to the floor.

The men dive for it. It lodges beneath the seat. In the mayhem, JACOB

throws himself out of the flapping door and sprawls onto the pavement.

People look down at him as the car speeds away.

EXT.  BROOKLYN - LATE AFTERNOON

JACOB grabs his back. He is in excruciating pain. He tries to get up,

but can't move. He reaches out to people passing by, but they ignore

him and hurry past.

A SALVATION ARMY SANTA has been watching the entire scene. After a

moment's consideration he leaves his post and ambles over to JACOB. He

leans down and steals his wallet.

EXT.  BROOKLYN STREETS - EVENING

CUT TO THE SOUND OF A SIREN as an AMBULANCE races through the streets.

INT.  HOSPITAL - EVENING

AN AMBULANCE CREW rushes JACOB to a HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM.

The RESIDENT ignores him. JACOB screams.

An ORDERLY pushes the gurney through a pair of sliding doors. JACOB

tries to get up but the pain keeps him immobilized.

INT.  CORRIDORS - NIGHT

JACOB begins a journey down what appears to be an endless series of

corridors. The wheels of the gurney turn with a hypnotic regularity.

The smooth tile floor gives way to roguh cement. The ORDERLY's feet

plod through pools of blood that coagulate in cracks and crevices along

the way. The surface grows rougher, the wheels more insistent. Body

parts and human bile splash against the walls as the gurney moves

faster.

JACOB, panicked, tries again to get up but to no effect. He glances to

the side and sees mournful CREATURES being led into dark rooms. No one

fights or struggles. We hear muffled screams from behind closed doors.

Occasionally he glances inside the rooms and sees mangled bodies in

strange contraptions, people in rusty iron lungs, and hanging from

metal cages. Dark eyes peer out in horror. In one room a baseboard

heater bursts into flame. No one seems concerned. A door opens. A

bicycle with plastic streamers on the handlebars lies crushed and

mangled. One of its wheels is still spinning. JACOB cries out but it is

not his voice we hear. Rather it is a familiar unearthly roar. His

whole body stiffens. As he rounds the corner he sees a figure, its head

vibrating in endless terror. it is the same image he has seen before.

JACOB screams.

INT.  ROOM - NIGHT

JACOB is wheeled into a tiny ROOM. A numer of "DOCTORS" are waiting. As

they draw closer JACOB notices that something about them is not right.

They bear a subtle resemblance to Bosch-like DEMONS, creatures of

another world. JACOB tries to sit up but winces in pain. He cannot

move. He tries to scream but no sound comes out.

Chains and pulleys hang from the ceiling. They are lowered and attached

with speed and efficiency to JACOB's arms and legs. He screams.

The "DOCTORS" laugh. There is the sound of a huge door closing. JACOB

is left in semi-darkness. Suddenly a new group of "DOCTORS" emerges

from the shadows. They are carrying sharp surgical instruments. They

surround JACOB, their eyes glistening as bright as their blades. JACOB

is panting and sweating in fear. One of the "DOCTORS" leans over JACOB.

He gasps with horror. It is JEZZIE.

She pays no attention to him. He stares at her, THE CAMERA TILTING DOWN

HER BODY. As it gets to her foot we see it is a decaying mass, swarming

with maggots. The "DOCTORS" laugh. They take great pleasure in his

suffering. Their voices are strange and not human. Each utterance

contains a multitude of contradictory tones, sincere and compassionate,

taunting and mocking at the same time. The confusion of meanings is a

torment of its own.

A "DOCTOR" approaches JACOB. As he turns, we notice with horror that he

has no eyes or eye sockets. He extracts a long needle from his belt and

positions it over JACOB's head. Like a divining rod it locates a

particular point near the crown of his head. With a powerful thrust the

"DOCTOR" shoves the needle into JACOB's skull and pushes it slowly into

his brain. JACOB howls.

EXT.  VIETNAM - NIGHT

CUT RAPIDLY TO VIETNAM and a replay of flashes of the opening sequence

of the film. SOLDIERS with bayonets are charging over rice paddies in

the dark of the night. ONE OF THE SOLDIERS charges at JACOB with a long

bayonet blade and jams it into his intestines. JACOB cries out.

INT.  ROOM - NIGHT

CUT BACK TO THE "DOCTORS".

The "DOCTORS" laugh and back away, disappearing into the darkness.

INT.  HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Suddenly a fluorescent light flashes overhead. NORMAL HOSPITAL WALLS

materialize instantaneously around him. A NURSE enters the room

followed by SARAH, ELI, and JED. They approach JACOB who is lying in

traction, suspended over a hospital bed.

There is a sudden sound of "DOCTORS" laughing. JACOB jerks his head

painfully, but does not see them.

JACOB's plea confuses SARAH. She responds with a kiss.

INT.  HOSPITAL - DAY

DAYLIGHT streams through the window in JACOB's ROOM. He is still in

traction and looks very uncomfortable. A new NURSE enters holding a

plastic container with a straw poking out.

The NURSE smiles and nods in appeasement.

She giggles nervously. There is a funny glint in her eyes. JACOB looks

away. He doesn't want to see it.

OMIT

INT.  HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - EVENING

There is a loud commotion in the HALL. We see LOUIS SCHWARTZ, JACOB's

chiropractor, screaming JACOB's name.

JACOB yells.

INT.  JACOB'S ROOM - DAY

LOUIS storms through JACOB's door followed by several NURSES and

ORDERLIES.

LOUIS stares furiously at JACOB stretched out on the traction

apparatus. He begins to yell.

LOUIS charges over to the traction equipment and begins working the

pulleys that suspend JACOB over the bed. The NURSES and ORDERLIES

become instantly hysterical and start screaming.

One of the ORDERLIES lunges at LOUIS who swings back at him with one of

the pulley chains. It just misses.

LOUIS lowers JACOB into a wheelchair while holding the others at bay.

NURSES and ORDERLIES part as he pushes him quickly from the room.

OMIT

INT.  CHIROPRACTIC OFFICE - EVENING

LOUIS helps JACOB over to an adjusting table in a room that, compared

with the hospital, is comfortable and serene. He pushes a lever and the

table rises to a vertical position. JACOB leans against it and rides it

down to a horizontal position. Every moment is agony for him.

JACOB turns to his left. LOUIS shakes his head in dismay.

LOUIS positions JACOB's other arm, bends his legs, and then pushes down

on his thigh. His spine moves with a cracking sound. JACOB groans.

He helps JACOB and repositions him. Again he pushes and the spine

cracks.

JACOB's toes dance as LOUIS gives him a quick, unexpected jab to the

lower vertebrae in his back.

JACOB steps cautiously away from the table. He moves hesitantly, with

deliberate restraint. LOUIS encourages him like a faith healer coaxing

the lame. His first steps have an aura of the miraculous about them.

JACOB walks slowly, without help. LOUIS smiles impishly. He looks like

a giant cherub.

LOUIS puts his arm around him. Then JACOB tries again, gradually

rediscovering his balance and strength. With each step his confidence

returns. LOUIS is pleased. Then, suddenly, without warning, JACOB turns

and heads toward the door.

He walks slowly out the door. LOUIS starts to go after him. JACOB turns

around and shakes his head "no." The look on his face is firm and

defiant. LOUIS stands back and lets him go.

EXT.  U.S. ARMY RECRUITING HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

CUT TO A SDIREN BLARING and a fire engine racing through the streets of

lower MANHATTAN. A CROWD is forming. Banks of lights and television

cameras amass in the cold night air. Police cars and mobile units rush

to the scene.

CUT TO JACOB. In one hand he is holding a brightly lit torch. In the

other he is holding a container of gasoline and pouring it on the steps

of the U.S. ARMY RECRUITING HEADQUARTERS. The volatile liquid splashes

against his pants and shoes and runs down the pavement. A five gallon

container lies emptying nearby. Gasoline belches from it insistently

and pours onto the street. Bystanders back away as the gasoline snakes

toward them.

Television cameras and microphones are pointing in JACOB's direction,

but at a safe distance. He is yelling at them, his teeth chattering

from the cold.

POLICE AMBULANCES are arriving at the scene. FIREMEN ready hoses at

nearby hydrants. T.V. CAMERAS are rolling.

He holds up the torch. A loudspeaker blares through the crowd.

Suddenly a lighted match flies in JACOB's direction. JACOB is enraged.

He brandishes the torch at the crowd.

Another match hurls toward him and dies in mid-air. PEOPLE on the

fringe of the crowd begin to run. JACOB does not move.

We hear laughter from PEOPLE in the crowd. As JACOB looks out into some

of their eyes he sees demons looking back. One of them throws another

match. Crazed, JACOB runs toward them. PEOPLE jump back.

Suddenly JACOB freezes. Standing on the sidelines, he sees one of the

ARMY OFFICIALS who trapped him in the car. He is reaching for a gun.

JACOB, stunned, yells at the top of hhis lungs.

With a defiant roar, he hurls the torch straight up into the air. We

see it from high above the crowd spinning higher and higher. All eyes

stare upward watching it in a kind of wonder. Then, reaching its apex,

just below the camera, it begins its descent. The eyes of the crowd

turn to fear. SOMEONE yells.

Screams fill the air as PEOPLE scramble to escape the potential

conflagration. Only JACOB remains motionless, standing silently, almost

heroically, in the middle of it all.

Suddenly the torch hits the ground and a pool of gasoline ignites with

a blinding flare that sends flames shooting in all directions. PEOPLE

panic. T.V. REPORTERS and CAMERAMEN run for their lives. The ARMY

OFFICIALS run, too. The flames travel toward the Army Headquarters and

rush along the curb. Water hoses are trying to douse them as they

spread. JACOB, surprisingly untouched by the fire, walks slowly through

the frightened crowds, as if in a daze. Viewed through the flames the

scene momentarily resembles a vision of Hell.

INT.  JACOB'S APT. - NIGHT

JACOB, stark naked and covered with goose bumps, runs his hands under a

shower spray. The water is freezing and taking forever to warm up.

Anxious, he dashes past his gasoline drenched clothes, grabs a suitcase

from the BEDROOM closet, and stuffs it with clothes. Then he hurries

back to the shower, tests it, and jumps in.

Lather covers JACOB's hair and hangs over his tightly closed eyes. His

entire body is covered in suds. He is washing as quickly as he can.

Suddenly he hears a noise as someone enters the BATHROOM. He tenses.

JACOB struggles to rinse the soap from his eyes. They are burning.

There is a shadow behind the curtain.

JACOB rubs his eyes, fighting to see. Suddenly the shower curtain is

thrown back. JACOB backs against the wall. A hand reaches in and pulls

his nipple, pinching hard.

He pushes her away and jumps out of the shower.

CUT TO JACOB dressing and piling the last of his clothes into his

suitcase. JEZZIE, in a robe, is watching him.

She stares at him with confusion. THE PHONE RINGS.

JACOB lunges for the phone.

He hangs up the phone and stands silently for a moment.

JACOB stares at JEZZIE for several moments but does not respond. The

11:00 NEWS is coming on. JACOB's image can be seen on the screen. We

hear the NEWSCASTER speaking.

JEZZIE stares at the T.V., dumbfounded. JACOB takes his suitcase and

hurries to the front door. He opens it a crack and peers into the

hallway. JEZZIE runs after him.

INT.  BUILDING CORRIDOR - NIGHT

JACOB gazes at JEZZIE for a moment and then hurries down the HALL. He

stops at the stairwell and looks back. JEZZIE is still standing there.

She is very angry. JACOB just stares at her for a moment and then

disappears down the stairwell.

EXT.  WESTSIDE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

JACOB is standing near the WESTSIDE HIGHWAY. GROUPS OF MEN in black

leather jackets are crusing the area and look at JACOB with curiosity.

One MAN in particular cruises by several times and then approaches him.

JACOB is startled when he sees him. He is the same YOUNG MAN who has

appeared throughout the film, assisting JACOB in moments of crisis.

A POLICE CAR passes them on the street. MICHAEL grabs JACOB's shoulder

and turns him away nervously.

HUDSON RIVER PIER - NIGHT

JACOB and MICHAEL are sitting on a deserted WEST SIDE PIER that juts

into the Hudson River. JACOB is wide-eyed as he listens to MICHAEL's

story.

JACOB can barely catch his breath, the information he is receiving is

so powerful to his mind.

MICHAEL stands up and begins walking in circles around the PIER. JACOB,

astounded, gets up and walks beside him.

JACOB is beginning to shake. MICHAEL pulls a container of pills out of

his jacket pocket.

JACOB shakes his head no.

He hesitates, obviously uncomfortable. His eyes grow puffy. He looks at

the river for a moment and then turns to JACOB.

JACOB's mouth drops open. The words hit him like a truck.

EXT.  VIETNAM - NIGHT

Gunfire explodes in the darkening sky. We are in Vietnam. JACOB is at

the bottom of a trench fighting with FRANK. Chaos surrounds them. Men

are screaming. The ENEMY is storming at them from the rear. ROD raises

his bayonet and jams it into the belly of his ATTACKER. It is only

after a series of jabs that he sees it's another American he's killed.

ROD's eyes go blank with confusion and terror.

JACOB looks up from the trench and sees a continuing wave of AMERICAN

SOLDIERS bearing down on them. FRANK jumps up, knocking JACOB to the

ground and slamming his rifle into JACOB's back. As he spins around

JACOB sees another SOLDIER charging at him. His bayonet is aimed at

JACOB's stomach. For the first time JACOB remembers the face of his

attacker. He is a YOUNG MAN, about 19 years old, clean cut, wearing

glasses. The two men stare at each other in terrible confusion. It

seems like a moment out of time. And then the SOLDIER lurches forward

and rams his bayonet deep into JACOB's abdomen.

CUT TO MICHAEL BACK ON THE PIER. JACOB is ashen-faced.

Tears start flowing down MICHAEL's face. He wipes them with his sleeve.

It takes him a moment to regain his composure. JACOB is shivering.

MICHAEL takes off his jacket, drapes it over JACOB, and leads him to

the wooden planks overhanging the water. They sit and gaze at the

JERSEY SHORE.

CUT TO A WIDE SHOT OF MICHAEL AND JACOB in pre-dawn light.

INT.  HOTEL - DAWM

JACOB and MICHAEL enter a sleazy HOTEL near the docks, obviously

frequented by a gay clientele. JACOB is uncomfortable as they check in.

MICHAEL, however, seems to know the ropes. They go to a small room.

MICHAEL reaches into his pocket and casually extracts a vial.

JACOB stretches out on the bed. He stares up at the ceiling and

examines its pock-marked lunar look. Long cracks and shallow craters

erode the surface. It is an alien terrain.

The words send a jolt through JACOB's body. He tries to get up but

can't. He's frightened.

The ceiling begins to rumble. Cracks split wide open. Huge crevasses

tear through the plaster. JACOB's world is crumbling. He stares in

horror as DEMONIC FORMS attempt to surge through the rupture above him.

Piercing eyes and sharp teeth glimmer in the darkness. Hooved feet and

pointed claws clamor to break through.

Instantly MICHAEL appears standing over him. He is holding the vial

with the antidote. He draws an eyedropper full of the fluid and holds

it over JACOB's mouth.

JACOB fights him, but MICHAEL forces the entire contents of the

eyedropper down his throat. JACOB gags. He tries to spit it out, but

can't.

Suddenly the ceiling erupts in violent clashes as whole chunks break

off and collide like continental plates. The collisons wreak havoc on

the DEMONS, chopping and dismembering them. Body parts fall from the

ceiling like a Devil's rain. Horrible screams echo from the other side.

Flashes of light and dark storm over JACOB's head, thundering like a

war in the heavens. It is a scene of raw power and growing catastrophe.

It builds in fury and rage until suddenly the ceiling explodes. JACOB's

eyes stare into the formlessness expanding around him. All space is

becoming a dark liquid void.

Gradually the liquid grows bluer, clearer. There is an undulating sense

to the imagery, a feeling of womb-like comfort. Strange lights appear

and sparkle before us like sunlight on the ocean. JACOB is rushing

upward, toward the surface.

With the delirious sound of water giving way to air, JACOB breaks

through. To his amazement, he finds himself floating out-stretched on

shimmering sunlit water. Above him are clouds of such wondrous beauty

that they cannot possibly be of the earth. Pillars of golden light

reach down from the heavens creating a cathedral of light. It is a

vision of heaven, a vast, almost mythic paradise. JACOB is awed.

A sudden movement catches his attention. He looks over and sees MICHAEL

standing before him. Only MICHAEL looks different. His face seems to

radiate an inner light, a transcendental beauty. JACOB is nearly

blinded by his presence and must shield his eyes to look at him.

The casualness of the words catches JACOB by surprise. He sits up. To

his shock and amazement, he finds that he is back in THE HOTEL ROOM.

MICHAEL is standing at the foot of the bed. JACOB is totally

disoriented. His eyes move slowly around the room, taking everything

in. He doesn't speak.

JACOB just stares at him for a while and then suddenly begins to laugh.

It is a huge laugh, full of energy and life.

EXT.  GREENWICH VILLAGE - DAY

JACOB and MICHAEL are walking through the STREETS OF GREENWICH VILLAGE.

It is early MORNING and the sidewalks are bustling with PEOPLE. JACOB

stares into their faces and beams when they smile back. MICHAEL enjoys

JACOB's happiness.

EXT.  WASHINGTON SQUARE - DAY

JACOB and MICHAEL walk through WASHINGTON SQUARE PARK.

He points to two POLICEMEN on the far side of the SQUARE.

EXT.  GRAMERCY PARK HOTEL - DAY

The TWO MEN head up to GRAMERCY PARK and stop in front of the GRAMERCY

PARK HOTEL. Reaching into his wallet, MICHAEL pulls out a huge stack of

credit cards and hands one to JACOB.

MICHAEL laughs, hugs JACOB, and walks away.

INT.  HOTEL ROOM - DAY

JACOB is in a lovely MOTEL ROOM overlooking GRAMERCY SQUARE. He is

sprawled out happily on the bed when there is a knock at the door. He

jumps up and opens it. JEZZIE is standing there. She looks at JACOB

quizzically. He smiles and takes her in his arms, swinging her into the

room.

JACOB grins.

CUT TO JACOB and JEZZIE lying in bed gently caressing one another. For

all his ardor JACOB is exhausted from the events of the preceding day.

While stroking JEZZIE's hair he begins to fall asleep. JEZZIE crawls on

top of him and shoves her hand down his pants. JACOB smiles.

DISSOLVE TO JACOB and JEZZIE making love.

DISSOLVE TO JACOB and JEZZIE lying in front of the T.V. watching a

romantic movie. JEZZIE snuggles up to JACOB.

There is a knock at the door. JACOB throws on a bathrobe. JEZZIE jumps

under the sheets.

JEZZIE's eyes brighten. JACOB opens the door. A BELLBOY wheels in a

table set for dinner. He sets it in a corner of the room. JEZZIE jumps

out of bed, runs to the table, sniffs at the food, and squeals

excitedly.

JEZZIE smiles.

DISSOLVE to JACOB and JEZZIE sitting next to a large window overlooking

GRAMERCY PARK. They are sipping champagne.

JACOB laughs. JEZZIE doesn't. Unexpectedly she grabs JACOB and pushes

him onto the bed. In seconds they are all over each other, their

clothes flying in all directions. They seem as happy as could be.

OMIT

INT.  GRAND CENTRAL STATION - DAY

JACOB enters GRAND CENTRAL STATION. He checks out all the PEOPLE around

him. Not a DEMON in sight. Hurrying to the TICKET WINDOW he gets in

line. The TICKET SELLER looks up.

JACOB pulls out MICHAEL's credit card. The SELLER rings it up. While he

is waiting JACOB notices a POLICEMAN looking at him. The stare

unsettles him. The SELLER hands JACOB his ticket. He takes it and

hurries into the CROWD. Looking back he notices the POLICEMAN is

following him.

INT.  MEN'S ROOM - DAY

JACOB enters the MEN'S ROOM. He hurries into one of the stalsls, drops

his pants, and sits. He eyes the graffiti on the walls and then notices

a wad of tissue stuffed into a hole between him and the next stall. It

is moving. Suddenly the tissue falls to the floor. JACOB glances at the

hole curiously and leans forward to examine it. He is shocked to see an

eye staring back at him.

Two lips form around the hole. A tongue wags obscenely.

The mouth is gone. JACOB hears the stall door fly open and feet running

from the room. He jumps up and grabs his pants. He dashes out of the

MEN'S ROOM. He hears footsteps and chases after them.

INT.  GRAND CENTRAL STATION - DAY

JACOB bursts into the MAIN TERMINAL. He sees someone rushing toward the

main doors and speeds after him. HOMELESS PEOPLE, huddling along the

corridors, watch as they run past. Escaping to the street, the MAN

disappears in the holiday throngs. JACOB, crazed, stands gasping for

breath. His fists dig into his coat pocket. Suddenly he feels something

and seems surprised when MICHAEL's CARD emerges in his hands.

OMIT

INT.  SOHO LOFT BUILDING - EVENING

JACOB runs up the stairs in a SOHO LOFT BUILDING. It is a dingy,

industrial staircase, poorly lit. He reaches a door with MICHAEL's name

painted on it in large black letters. He knocks loudly. There is no

answer. He pounds on it. Another door opens on the floor above. A head

sticks out.

JACOB has a frenzied look in his eyes. He searches around the staircase

and sees a pile of lumber stacked in a corner. He grabs a two-by-four

and lunges at the door.

JACOB doesn't answer. He smashes wildly at the door until the lock

flies open.

INT.  MICHAEL'S LOFT - EVENING

JACOB charges into the dark space groping for a light. He finds it. The

LOFT is a disaster area. Nothing is standing. JACOB runs from room to

room. In the back he discovers a large private chemistry lab. Glass

vials and bottles are shattered on the floor.

JACOB rifles through the cabinets. A few bottles are intact but their

labels mean nothing to him.

He reaches for one cabinet and notices a reddish liquid oozing out from

the bottom. He opens it. MICHAEL's severed head stares him in the face.

It is smiling.

A scream rings out as the MAN from upstairs sees what JACOB has seen.

JACOB jumps back, trips, and falls over MICHAEL's headless body. It is

lying sprawled across the floor.

JACOB stumbles to pull himself up. He is in a state of unrelieved

panic. He runs past the MAN and spills out the doorr. He takes two and

three stairs at a time, nearly flying to the street.

EXT.  SOHO STREETS - NIGHT

JACOB rushes into the icy air and runs wildly down the sidewalk as fast

as his legs will move. With unexpected violence he charges into the

side of a building. Over and over he hurls himself against it. He grabs

for the bricks. His fingers insert themselves into the crevices. It is

as though he is trying to merge with the wall.

Suddenly JACOB turns and dashes into the street. A taxi is speeding

toward him, its lights the only sign of life and warmth in the dark

night. JACOB steps into its path. It is hard to tell if he is trying to

stop the cab or waiting to be hit. The taxi screeches to a halt. JACOB

stares at it a moment and then steps to get in. The DRIVER tries to

pull off but JACOB yanks at the door and drags himself inside.

INT.  TAXI - NIGHT

Rain is beginning to fall. It streaks the windows.

JACOB reaches into his pants pocket, pulls out a twenty dollar bill,

and hands it to the DRIVER. He takes it.

CUT TO THE TAXI heading down WEST BROADWAY, approaching the BROOKLYN

BRIDGE, crossing the EAST RIVER, and driving through dark BROOKLYN

STREETS.

JACOB's face passes in and out of dense shadows. Every time he is

bathed in light his image seems to alter. Something in him is falling

away.

EXT.  SARAH'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

JACOB gets out of the TAXI and approaches the LOBBY of SARAH'S

APARTMENT BUILDING. JACOB is greeted by the DOORMAN.

INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT

JACOB stops in front of the APARTMENT door and reaches his hand

underneath a section of the hallway carpet. It comes back with a key.

He inserts it into the lock and gently opens the door. He calls out.

INT.  SARAH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Some lights are on. The APARTMENT looks comfortable and cozy.

There is still no answer. JACOB is surprised. He peers into the dark

LIVING ROOM and then walks to the KITCHEN. No one is around. A photo of

JACOB, SARAH, AND THEIR BOYS is sitting on the counter. He picks it up

and carries it with him through the apartment. He walks into his old

BEDROOM and then into the BOYS' ROOM. The beds are still unmade. There

is no one home. He sees his image in the BATHROOM mirror and turns away

in disgust. He walks back to the LIVING ROOM. He is about to switch the

lights on when he hears footsteps coming down the hall. He calls out.

JACOB is startled to see JEZZIE enter the room. She does not seem he

usual self. She appears larger, more imposing.

JACOB is nervous.

JEZZIE stares at JACOB with a frightening, powerful glare. The edge of

her coat rustles and flutters as she moves toward him. It is an

innocent sound at first, but after a moment it transforms into

something else, an obsessive flapping noise, the sound of a wing.

JACOB's body feels the first waves of an inner tremor. His legs are

shaking.

JEZZIE begins walking around the dark living room as she talks to him.

Something about her walk is very unnatural. JACOB eyes her fearfully.

In the darkness JEZZIE's movements become increasingly strange and

elusive. We see her pass before a shadow and disappear within it, only

to reappear, seconds later, in a doorway on the other side of the room.

JACOB spins around, confused. Suddenly JEZZIE is inches from his face,

although it seems like there has been no time for her to get there. Her

movements are totally impossible, defying all logic, all physical laws.

JACOB freezes.

JEZZIE has disappeared in the darkness of the room. Only the sounds of

flapping wings remain. They grow louder and more menacing, whooshing

past him with no visible source.

JACOB, frightened, turns toward the door as if to hurry out. "JEZZIE"

laughs.

JACOB pauses a moment and then turns to confront the terror behind him.

JEZZIE appears from the shadows. Her coat collar obscures her and it

seems for a moment that she has no face. Then, to JACOB's horror, she

turns around. He is staring at the vibrating creature he has seen so

often before. Glimpsed almost in abstraction it is a living terror,

dark and undefinable. Its face is a black and impenetrable void in

constant vibration. Its voice is an unspeakable demonic cry, the

essence of fear and suffering. JACOB pulls away from it, overhwelmed by

confusion. He is rooted in fear.

A sudden wind howls through the room, great gales blowing JACOB's hair

straight up. It is like a hurricane pushing him into the wall. He can

barely stand. He struggles to pull himself away. The flapping sound

returns, charging at him from all directions. It is as if the darkness

itself is swooping down, trying to envelop him.

New terrible sounds arise, chain saws slashing through the air, knives,

and sabers ripping through space with unrelenting anger. Guns fire and

explode past his head. It is as though all the sounds of destruction

are closing in on him. JACOB yells but his own voice is lost in the

melee. Terrified, he looks heavenward, as if crying for help.

Suddenly, from the noise, a calm voice rises, speaking, as if from a

distance. It is LOUIS. JACOB is shocked to hear him. He stands

motionless.

The voice fades. JACOB just stands there, not sure what to do. And then

the sounds return. Only now they are more terrifying than ever.

Hideously loud, they become a cacophony of sounds, voices of parents,

friends, lovers, the sounds of battle, fighting, and dying.

JACOB looks up and sees the creature in the center of the room. All the

sounds seem to emenate from it. The more JACOB stares at it the louder

they become. After a moment, JACOB takes a huge breath. We sense a

great resolve forming inside him. Then, slowly, courageously, he begins

moving toward it.

NEw and more terrifying noises assault JACOB, attempting to drive him

back, but he will not be stopped. He continues walking toward the

creature.

In the hallway a standing lamp slams sparking to the floor. It rolls

back and forth like a living thing, with a maddening hypnotic

regularity. Doors slam open and closed, unlatching, snapping, shutting,

with deafening force. The room itself seems like an organic presence.

It is alive, angry, and threatening.

The CREATURE sits in the midst of the insanity like the source of

madness itself. It writhes, contorts and vibrates with unstoppable

fury. JACOB, terrified, but unrelenting, continues to approach it.

AS THE CAMERA DRAWS CLOSER TO THE CREATURE'S HEAD the density of its

featureless form overwhelms the screen. It is like staring into

emptiness itself, the ultimate darkness.

With superhuman effort JACOB grabs hold of the creature. It is like

grabbing hold of a live wire. His body begins shaking uncontrollably

like a man being electrocuted. He is flying in all directions but does

not let go. His fingers claw at the creature's head. JACOB struggles

defiantly with the monster.

Suddenly a terrible voice emerges from within it.

JACOB does not respond. It cries out again.

Deep inside the darkness JACOB begins to make out the presence of a

form, something writhing and tortured lurking before us. It looks

briefly like an animal until we realize it is the image of a human

face. It is covered by a dark suffocating film, like a mask.

JACOB digs into it with all his might and pulls it off.

DEAD SILENCE as JACOB SEES HIS OWN FACE staring back at him from

beneath the mask. It is JACOB SINGER as we first saw him on the

battlefield in Vietnam. Only now his image is pale and lifeless. It

takes JACOB a moment to realize that he is dead. The recognition is one

of terrible confusion and pain. JACOB stares at himself for a long time

as a huge cry wells up inside him. It bursts forth with devastating

sadness.

As that instant the whole of space seems to explode in a flash of

catacylsmic power. Hundreds of images from JACOB's life flash before

us, his birth, his childhood, his adulthood. The demons, the room,

JEZZIE, LOUIS, MICHAEL, SARAH, all seem to assail us in a rush of

blinding intensity.

We are flying over a landscape of memories, zooming across a constantly

changing field of images. Some of the images move, some of the people

in them speak. They are not particularly significant memories, in some

ways they are quite banal, but something about them is infused with

life and joy. Even the painful moments resonate with vital force. Some

of the moments we recognize from the time we've spent with JACOB. Some

we have not seen before. There is no order to them, no logic to why

they have been recalled.

A newborn baby takes its first breath and screams. SARAH pulls clothes

off a clothes line on a rainy day. JACOB's FATHER stands in the Florida

surf as sea foam laps gently at his legs. PAUL, FRANK, and JACOB play

cards on the edge of a rice paddy. GABE rides his bike into the path of

an oncoming car. A child puts his ear next to a bowl of cereal,

listening to it talk. A young girl standing in a doorway lifts up her

blouse to show her new breasts. JACOB and SARAH slice a wedding cake

that topples to the floor. JEZZIE looks at JACOB and asks "Love me a

little?"

And then it is over. Total silence overwhelms the screen, a wonderful

soothing calm. JACOB's eyes open and he is shocked to find himself

sitting on the floor in SARAH's apartment. He is all alone. The first

rays of early morning sunlight are filtering through the window.

Something about the apartment seems transfigured, magical. JACOB sits

motionless, stunned to be back there.

The faint sound of music can be heard coming from the hallway. It is

warm and familiar, the tinkling of a music box. JACOB listens to it for

a few moments and then something registers inside him. Curious, he gets

up and approaches the corridor.

There is no response. Suddenly the music stops. JACOB freezes for a

moment. He sees someone standing in the shadows at the other end.

Tentatively JACOB moves forward. As he draws closer he begins to see

the outline of a child. Then, all of a sudden, he realizes who it is.

His eyes well up as he stands there, the full impact of the moment

registering inside him. It's his son, GABE. He is carrying the same

musical lunch box we have seen before. The young boy smiles warmly at

his father. It is the smile of an angel. JACOB swallows hard.

JACOB runs to his son. Unable to hold back the tears, he embraces him

in a rush of love and emotion.

They hug one another over and over. JACOB, overcome, sits down on the

stiars. After a moment GABE puts his arm around his father's shoulder

in a gesture of surprising maturity and compassion. We sense for an

instant that their roles have reversed. GABE reaches for JACOB's hand

and gently encourages him to stand up.

With a sweet tug GABE leads his father up the steps.

Sunlight streams down from the top of the stiars, hitting the first

landing. GABE is bathed in its warm glow. As JACOB reaches the landing,

he too is surrounded by the comforting light.

GABE hurries up the last set of stairs. JACOB turns to follow but is

stunned by the brilliance of the light pouring in from above.

Squinting, he cannot see his son. Then suddenly GABE steps back out of

the light and takes his father's hand once more. His eyes sparkle with

excitement.

JACOB smiles at his son. GABE smiles at him. It is a moment of total

euphoria. THE CAMERA HOLDS as they continue up the stairs.

GABE's voice slowly trails off as he and his father disappear in the

intenstity of the light. THE CAMERA HOLDS on the image. For a brief but

stunning moment there appears to be a huge ethereal staircase

shimmering before us. It rises up into infinite dimensions. Then the

brilliance of its blinding light overwhelms the screen.

Suddenly the brightness condenses into a smaller light source. It holds

for a second and then flashes off. An overhead surgical lamp remains

stubbornly in view.

INT.  VIETNAM FIELD HOSPITAL - DAY

A DOCTOR leans his head in front of the lamp and removes his mask. His

expression is somber. He shakes his head. His words are simple and

final.

CUT TO JACOB SINGER lying on an operating table in a large ARMY FIELD

TENT in VIETNAM. The DOCTOR steps away. A NURSE rudely pulls a green

sheet over his head. The DOCTOR turns to one of the aides and throws up

his hands in defeat.

AN ORDERLY wheels JACOB's body past rows of other DOCTORS and NURSES

fighting to save lives. A YOUNG VIETNAMESE BOY pulls back a screen door

to let them out of the tent. It is a bright, fresh morning. The sun is

rising.

ADDENDUM 1:  PROFESSOR STERN

--

INT.  CITY COLLEGE LECTURE HALL - DAY

CUT TO a huge ampitheatre-style LECTURE HALL at CITY COLLEGE. It

is almost empty. No more than FORTY STUDENTS are scattered near

the front of nearly three hundred seats. All are listening to

PROFESSOR EMANUEL STERN who is nearing the end of his lecture.

One of the STUDENTS seems about to fall asleep and keeps nodding

his head.

MR. PALMER sits up quickly in his seat as other STUDENTS smile.

A door opens in the upper reaches of the lecture hall. JACOB

enters and walks quietly down the stairs to within hearing range

of the professor.

JACOB takes a seat at one of the desks. There is a pencil lying

on it which he fingers distractedly.

MR. PALMER is nodding off again.

The STUDENTS seem surprised but not unhappy with the sudden

dismissal. They quickly gather their books and begin the long

climb to the exits. Only JACOB remains seated.

PROFESSOR STERN looks up and stares at KACOB for several seconds

before recognizing him.

JACOB comes down the aisle and clasps hands with his old

PROFESSOR.

EXT.  CITY COLLEGE - DAY

JACOB AND PROFESSOR STERN walk down the city streets that

constitute the CAMPUS of CITY COLLEGE.

INT.  OFF CAMPUS COFFEE SHOP - DAY

JACOB and PROFESSOR STERN are sitting at a quiet table in a

nearly empty coffee shop. They are both fixing cups of tea, not

speaking. Suddenly JACOB looks at STERN.

STERN pauses. He looks at JACOB. The intensity of his gaze is

unsettling and JACOB reaches for his tea. The cup rattles.

A look of concern fills STERN's eyes.

STERN sips his tea slowly. He is thinking.

JACOB gazes at his old friend and mentor, frustration blazing in

his eyes. They are both surprised to see tears form and run down

his cheek. JACOB reaches for a napkin and dries them quickly.

STERN, uncomfortable in the face of emotion, turns away.

---

ADDENDUM 2: THE PARTY AT DELLA'S

---

Suddenly a strange and terrifying spectacle unfolds before him.

The DANCERS undergo a shocking transformation, a full three-

dimensional alteration of their physical forms. Clothes fuse to

their bodies like new skin. Horns and tails emerge and grow like

exotic genitalia, exciting a frenzy among the DANCERS. New

appendages appear unfolding from their flesh. Dorsal fins

protrude from their backs. Armored scales run in scallops down

their legs. Tails entwine sensuously. Long tongues lick at the

undersides of reptilian bellies. The metamorphosis holds a

biological fascination. Bones and flesh mold into new forms of

life, creatures of another world.

CUT TO JACOB's face as it registers terror and disbelief. He

stares at the DANCERS. They are perverse, corrupt aspects of

their normal selves. He is mesmerized by JEZZIE. Her flesh has

grown hard and wrinkled and has the markings of a snake. Her

tongue, long and curled, darts in and out of her mouth

repeatedly. Her eyes are thin and domineering. They lock JACOB in

their gaze. He wants to stop, to run, but JEZZIE won't release

him.

JACOB grabs his eyes as though trying to pull the vision from

them but it won't go away. The music throbs. His actions become

spastic, almost delirious. His hysteria attracts the attention of

the other DANCERS.

A circle forms around JACOB and JEZZIE as their frenzy transcends

the boundaries of dance and erupts into an almost orgiastic

display. JACOB is out of control. His fury becomes a kind of

exorcism, a desperate attempt to free himself from his body and

his mind.

CUT TO JACOB as his eyes pass beyond pain. The dark walls of the

APARTMENT fade away.

EXT.  VIETNAM - NIGHT

Strange faces in infantry helmets appear in the darkness,

outlined by a bright moon that is emerging from behind a large

cloud. The faces are looking down and voices are speaking.

His eyes focus on the moon. Rings of light emanate from it

filling the sky with their sparkling brilliance. The rings draw

us forward with a quickening intensity that grows into

exhilarating speed. The rush causes them to flash

stroboscopically and produce a dazzling, almost sensual, surge of

color. The display is spectacular and compelling. A voice can be

heard in the distance.

Suddenly the flickering rings begin to define a tangible image, a

kind of CELESTIAL STAIRCASE, rising up into infinite dimensions.

As we speed toward it, it grows increasingly majestic. The image

is so awesome and other-worldly that it is difficult to grasp

what is being seen.

Music can be heard in the distance. It too is celestial in its

beauty. Then, unexpectedly, it grows hard and insistent, like a

heartbeat. Heavy breathing accompanies the sound. The image of

the STAIRCASE shatters and disappears, replaced by intense

flashes of red and blue light. The music grows louder and reaches

a thundering crescendo. Then silence.

---

ADDENDUM 3: JACOB'S LIVING ROOM

---

INT.  JACOB'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

CUT TO APPLAUSE from a real television game show as JACOB

switches channels on the LIVING ROOM T.V. He stops on an

interview program, turns up the sound, and runs to the BATHROOM.

The CAMERA stays on the television. JACOB can be heard urinating

in the distance.

MAC HAYES, a young, virile, and smug REPORTER is speaking.

THE REVEREND fills the T.V. screen.

The toilet flushes and JACOB walks back into the LIVING ROOM and

turns down the sound.

Suddenly the telephone rings. It startles JACOB. He jumps. It

rings again. He reaches down, turns off the T.V., and picks up

the phone. His eyes continue to stare at the blank screen as he

talks.

---

ADDENDUM 4: JACOB'S BEDROOM

---

INT.  JACOB'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

THE BEDROOM is dark. JACOB and JEZZIE are making love. A half-

smoked joint is smouldering in an ashtray by the bed. JEZZIE is

poised on top of JACOB and his eyes are focused on her face.

A hurricane lamp casts a warm glow over their bodies. Its

flickering light plays games with JACOB's eyes and for a moment

JEZZIE seems to disappear. JACOB reaches out for her breasts and

his hands seem to vanish into the shadows dancing across her.

With sudden, hallucinogenic impact, JACOB feels himself drawn

into a starry universe opening from inside her.

THE CAMERA plunges through her image into a galxy of stars and

rushes toward one that is twinkling brightly. Pulsations of its

light whiten the screen. Out of the whiteness appears a momentary

flash of the CELESTIAL STAIRCASE, accompanied by sounds of sexual

climax.

The STAIRCASE sparkles for an instant and then it's gone. The

sparkle becomes a glimmer in JEZZIE's eye as her face fills the

screen. She looks especially lovely and radiant. Her image moves

with the lamplight.

JACOB's face is ecstatic. He can barely talk and simply basks in

JEZZIE's glow. Slowly, she leans forward and whispers in his ear.

---

ADDENDUM 5: DEMON IN THE WALL

---

INT. JACOB'S APARTMENT - DAY

JACOB is sitting in a comfortable chair in his living room. He is

reading. The room is dark, lit only by a reading light. The walls

are mostly in shadow. The light, however, falls on one section of

the wall, a portion that has been lined in fake wood paneling.

JACOB's eyes suddenly lift off the page and roam over the wood

grain on the wall. All of a sudden he notices something strange,

an image in the grain. He stares at it. The more he stares the

more precise its definition. The image of a DEMON appears in the

wall.

JACOB sits up quickly and stares at the walll. It is impossible

to get the DEMON's image out of the grain. It seems etched, even

imbedded, in the paneling.

JACOB looks away and returns to his book. He is reading about

archetypes and the primordial mind. But the book does not hold

his attention. He is obsessed with the wall. Its molecules seem

suddenly active, the wood grain suddenly animate. Layers begin to

appear in the surface of the wall as the grain patterns slowly

define a rocky, barren landscape.

The DEMON is growing solid. Cries and screams rise up in the

distance. Flames and a red glow emanate from the space extending

rapidly into the wall. The image of Hell erupts before him.

JACOB stands up. He can see bodies suffering beyond the wall,

masses of PEOPLE wailing and enduring the torments of a fiery

world. The DEMON's arm slowly extends from the plane of the wall

and reaches into the room. He is huge, covered in flames and

skulls, a living horror. He grabs hold of JACOB and pulls him

toward the wall. JACOB tries to back away but he cannot. His face

is white with fear. The DEMON draws JACOB toward the inferno.

Suddenly JEZZIE appears, the light from the BEDROOM flooding the

paneled wall. The DEMON vanishes instantly.

She stops dead in her tracks.

CUT TO JACOB pressed up against the wall, defying gravity and

logic, as though about to merge with the solid surface. His body

holds there for a moment and then collapses to the floor. JEZZIE

goes to him.

He doesn't answer. He looks at JEZZIE with a blank stare. His

body begins shaking.

INT.  JACOB'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

JACOB is lying on the bed, curled up in a fetal pose. JEZZIE is

stroking his hair and trying to calm him.

JEZZIE wraps herself around his shivering body and warms him with

her own. The image seems tender and comforting until we notice

JEZZIE's tongue darting nervously in and out. It looks strangely

like a snake's.

---

ADDENDUM 6: THE HOSPITAL

---

The RESIDENT injects the serum into JACOB's veins while two

ORDERLIES hold him still. JACOB barely struggles. His eyes fixate

on the EMERGENCY ROOM WALL. It is white and sterile. Within

moments it begins to emit a reddish glow. JACOB watches with

astonishment as the wall's two-dimensional surface separates into

three-dimensional planes. The solid surface gives way to a DARK

CHAMBER that was not there before.

Out of the transmuted space CREATURES begin to form. Bosch-like

DEMONS with horns and tails, undeniably of another world. Slowly

several of them emerge from the wall and approach JACOB. They

look like parodies of doctors and nurses, wearing traditional

hospital gowns. Without a word they wheel him through the space

where the wall had been. JACOB tries to scream but no sound comes

out.

INT.  HELL - NIGHT

The DARK CHAMBER is filled with mournful CREATURES being led by

DEMONS through a series of CORRIDORS. No one fights or struggles.

JACOB's stretcher is moved through the darkness. He tries to sit

up but is forced back down. He is obviously drugged.

JACOB is wheeled into a tiny CHAMBER. A number of DEMONS are

waiting for him. Chains and pulleys hang from the ceiling. They

are lowered and attached with speed and efficiency to JACOB's

arms and legs. The devices are manipulated smoothly and JACOB is

lifted off the stretcher. The chains retract, stretching him

spread-eagle in the air. He screams loudly.

The DEMONS laugh. There is the sound of a huge door closing.

JACOB is left in darkness. The darkness is hallucinogenic. Fires

appear beyond the boundaries of the wall; images of Dante's

Inferno, souls of the dead in endless torment. JACOB is but one

of countless beings sharing a vastness of torment. His own

screams for help are lost in the magnitude of voices crying.

Suddenly, out of the meancing shadows, a contingent of DEMONS

emerges. They are carrying sharp surgical instruments. They

surround JACOB, their eyes glistening as bright as their blades.

JACOB is panting and sweating with fear. For an instant, one of

the DEMONS looks like JEZZIE. JACOB calls out to her.

The DEMONS laugh as she changes form. They take great pleasure in

his suffering. Their voices are strange and not human. Each

utterance contains a multitude of contradictory tones, sincere

and compassionate, taunting and mocking at the same time. The

confusion of meanings is a torment of its own.

---

ADDENDUM 7: JACOB'S BEDROOM

---

INT.  JACOB'S BEDROOM

JACOB is lying on the floor of his BEDROOM doing exercises for

his back. He has several days' growth of beard and does not look

well. His mind is drifting and only the occasional pain in his

back reminds him of what he is doing. JEZZIE can be heard

vacuuming the carpet in the LIVING ROOM. Suddenly the door swings

open. The wail of the vacuum cleaner causes JACOB to tense. His

eyes drift down from the ceiling. JEZZIE vacuums around him and

seems insensitive to his presence.

JEZZIE shoves the vacuum cleaner under the bed and hits

something. JACOB tightens. She looks and is shocked to discover a

can of gasoline and boxes of kitchen matches. It takes her a

second to understand the implications of what she has found.

JACOB is ready when she begins yelling.

She begins to remove the gasoline can.

JEZZIE lets go of the can and grabs the vacuum. She moves it

furiously across the carpet. Suddenly JACOB sees her tongue

darting in and out, unconsciously. She looks strange, not human.

JACOB freezes. He yells out.

The sound of the vacuum cleaner drowns out his voice. He yells

again. JEZZIE sees him and turns off the machine. His voice booms

out.

JEZZIE ignores the question and turns the vacuum cleaner back on.

JACOB rolls over and pulls out the plug.

She storms out of the room, kicking the vacuum cleaner as she

goes. JACOB can see flashes of her through the open crack of the

bedroom door. Occasional curses and epithets hurl through the

opening along with a flood of tears.

JACOB catches glimpses of her as she grabs her coat from the hall

closet and as she pulls her money out of the desk drawer. He can

see the lamp as she shoves it to the floor and hears it shatter

as she stomps on it with her foot. There is a blur as she heads

to the front door and a deafening bang as she leaves.

JACOB's eyes drift up to the ceiling. They hardly blink. He

stares at the plaster, chipped and cracked, above him. Suddenly

the cracks begin to move. JACOB jumps up. A DEMON is

materializing over his head. JACOB yells and grabs hold of the

extension pole for the vacuum cleaner. With a furious cry he

begins jamming it at the ceiling. Rather than blot out the

evolving image his attack helps to define it. JACOB slams harder.

Plaster and wood lath cover the floor. The DEMON is gone. Panting

hard, JACOB reaches for matches and the gasoline can. He stops

and stares at them with great intensity.

---

ADDENDUM 8: THE ANTIDOTE SEQUENCE

---

The ceiling begins to rumble. Cracks split wide open. Huge

crevasses tear through the plaster. JACOB's world is crumbling.

He stares in horror as DEMONIC FORMS attempt to surge through the

rupture above him. Piercing eyes and sharp teeth glimmer in the

darkness. Hooved feet and pointed claws clamor to break through.

Instantly MICHAEL appears standing over him. He is holding the

vial with the antidote. He draws an eyedropper full of the fluid

and holds it over JACOB's mouth.

JACOB fights him but MICHAEL forces the entire contents of the

eyedropper down his throat. JACOB gags. He tries to spit it out,

but can't.

Suddenly the ceiling erupts in violent clashes as whole chunks

break off and collide with one another like continental plates.

The collisions wreak havoc on the DEMONS, chopping and

dismembering them. Body parts fall from the ceiling like a

Devil's rain. Horrible screams echo from the other side.

Flashes of light and dark storm over JACOB's head, thundering

like a war in the heavens. It is a scene of raw power and growing

catastrophe. It builds in fury and rage until suddenly the

ceiling explodes.

Matter atomizes instantly. Trillions of particles hurl

chaotically in all directions. The walls shatter into a dazzling

brightness. For a moment there is a sense of intense forward

movement, a rush toward oblivion. And then, suddenly, it stops.

There is absolute quiet and stillness.

JACOB's eyes stare into the formlessness sparkling around him.

All space has become a shining void. Gradually faint pastel

colors appear like colored molecules, dancing and spinning,

redirecting space into new formations. They weave patterns of

intricate complexity and stunning beauty.

As the colors grow brighter and more vivid their abstraction

gives way to solid form. A GARDEN SCENE emerges. It is a GARDEN

OF LIGHT, a vast, almost mythic, Rousseau paradise. It radiates

an intense shimmering light.

JACOB's eyes are cpativated by the vision before him. A sudden

movement catches his attention. He looks up and notices MICHAEL

still standing beside him. MICHAEL, however, is rapidly changing

form. It is a full, plastic, three-dimensional metamorphosis. His

very flesh seems to expand and glow with its own inner light. His

face shines and radiates an almost transcendental beauty.

JACOB is nearly blinded by MICHAEL's presence and must shield his

eyes to look at him. MICHAEL smiles an extraordinary and joyous

smile that radiates such intense luminosity that JACOB has to

squint to see it.

Suddenly MICHAEL steps off the ground. He rises into the air and

floats above JACOB. JACOB can barely breathe as he watches him.

MICHAEL rises into a sky filled with orbs and blazing lights. The

lights shine on JACOB's head. He effervesces and shimmers in

their glow.

One of the orbs sends a burst of light exploding over JACOB. So

intense is the light that JACOB grabs his eyes. As he opens them

again he sees that the GARDEN is fading back into pure light.

MICHAEL, too, is fading.

Another burst of light and the GARDEN is reabsorbed by the void.

Only the brightness remains. It is many seconds before we realize

that the HOTEL ROOM is coming together, reconstructed by the

light. In moments it is fully formed. Sunlight is pouring through

the window. MICHAEL is sleeping lightly in a chair. He hears

JACOB stare and sits up.

JACOB is sitting on the bed. He does not seem to know where he

is. His eyes are filled with awe. They move slowly around the

room, taking everything in. He doesn't speak. MICHAEL gets up and

sits beside him. He respects his silence.

---

ADDENDUM 9: HOTEL ROOM

---

INT.  HOTEL ROOM - DAY

JACOB enters the HOTEL ROOM. JEZZIE is already there watching the

evening news. She is still in her postal uniform, lying on the

bed. She taps the mattress, inviting JACOB to lie next to her. A

WOMAN is crying to a REPORTER on the T.V.

JACOB snaps off the T.V.

There is a quiet rage building in JEZZIE's eyes as she continues

to stroke JACOB's chest. He tries to relax and give himself over

to the movement of her hand. Silently she leans over and begins

licking his stomach. JACOB's eyes close. His stomach hardens. He

reaches back and adjusts the pillow beneath his head. Slowly,

JEZZIE works her way back up to his chest. Her tongue darts in

and out suggestively. He eyes are burning with anger. Her mouth

poises itself over his nipple. She toys with it for a few seconds

and then chomps down hard. The bite draws blood.

JACOB screams. His eyes shoot open. For the flash of an instant

he sees a DEMON hovering over him, a hideous horned creature

licking his blood. JACOB flies off the bed as the creature hurls

to the floor. JACOB is ready to pounce on it when he sees that it

is JEZZIE lying at his feet. His head begins reeling. He backs

away from the bed, not taking his eyes off JEZZIE for a second.

He backs to the closet and grabs his coat.

JACOB grabs his wallet and his glasses. He backs toward the door.

She stands up and begins to approach him. JACOB lifts up a desk

chair and holds it in front of him. Blood is running down his

chest.

JACOB throws the chair at the floor, opens the door, and hurries

into the HALLWAY. JEZZIE scurries around the chair and runs to

the door. She yells after him, but he is already gone.

---

ADDENDUM 10: THE END OF THE MOVIE

---

INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT

JACOB stoops in front of the APARTMENT door and reaches his hand

underneath a section of the hallway carpet. It comes back with a

key. He inserts it into the lock and gently opens the door.

INT.  SARAH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

The lights are on and the APARTMENT looks comfortable and cozy.

There is still no answer. JACOB is surprised. He walks into the

LIVING ROOM and then the KITCHEN. No one is around. He walks into

his old BEDROOM and then the BOYS' ROOM. He is surprised to hear

footsteps coming down the hall. He turns around and calls out.

JACOB is startled to see JEZZIE enter the room. She does not seem

to be her usual self. She seems larger, more imposing.

JACOB is nervous.

JEZZIE stares at JACOB with a frightening, powerful glare. Her

lips snarl. Her tongue begins darting in and out, only now it is

not a nervous habit but a conscious act. JACOB's body feels the

first waves of an inner tremor. His legs are shaking.

JEZZIE smiles at him. Her tongue wags and suddenly shoots from

her mouth beyond human extension. JACOB recoils.

JEZZIE's head begins to tighten and squeeze, as though she is

suffering from cramps. JACOB watches in horror as her skull gives

birth to pointed horns.

JACOB's eyes are locked on JEZZIE. His mouth is wide open. His

body is shaking badly. He tries to back away from her but his

legs barely move.

Suddenly the pictures on the wall crash to the floor. Plaster

from the ceiling breaks off in huge chunks and slams to the

carpet. Light bulbs and lamps explode. JACOB runs to the door. He

pulls it open and screams. He is on the edge of a fiery abyss.

JEZZIE laughs with a new intensity of demonic force. JACOB spins

around.

Suddenly JEZZIE reaches for her tongue and pulls at it with all

her might. It is an act of total, unrelieved grotesqueness. With

each yank the horror grows as JEZZIE literally pulls herself

inside out before JACOB's eyes.

The emerging creature is JEZZIE transfigured, a demonic presence

beyond anything we have seen before. It is black and covered with

a thick oozing slime. Its head, still recognizable as JEZZIE, is

rodent-like, with piercing green eyes and terrible horns

protruding from its brow. Its powerful arms have long spiked

claws. Its feet are cloven hooves. Extending from its back is a

long, thick, muscular tail that whips around the room with

devastating force. It throws furniture crashing through the air.

A sudden cracking sound emerges from the DEMON's back. Dark forms

penetrate the air. JACOB is breathless as huge wings unfold and

spread out to the living room walls. The sound of their flapping

is deafening. The walls shatter from their blows. As they crumble

darkness appears on the other side. There are no other rooms. The

VOID envelops them. The INFERNO emerges in all directions. The

DEMON roars.

CUT TO JACOB's face. He has gone beyond fear. An intensity of

rage is building in him that we have not witnessed before. His

whole image seems transformed by it. He glows like a volcano

before it erupts.

Suddenly he explodes. The full fury of the Ladder detonates

inside him. He yells at the DEMON with all his might.

With a power and energy of devastating force he attacks the

DEMON. JACOB is battling for his very soul and tears at the DEMON

with an animalistic fury that takes it by surprise. Its giant

wings flap furiously, lifting them both up off the floor. JACOB

keeps fighting. He claws, bites, and rips at the wings,

decimating their delicate fabric.

The DEMON, shocked, and trying to gain control, crashes up

through the last fragments of the ceiling. JACOB does not let go.

They burst into the fiery darkness. The room crumbles beneath

them and disappears into the void.

The abyss opens beneath them. JACOB continues his attack. His

legs are locked around the DEMON's waist. His hands dig into her

eyes. The DEMON shrieks and surges downward with awesome

velocity.

The DEMON charges into a rocky slope, smashing JACOB into its

cliffs. JACOB claws at her wings, shredding as much of them as he

can reach. The DEMON takes a huge chunk out of JACOB's arm. JACOB

screams, grabs a rock, and shatters the DEMON's teeth. The DEMON

falls to the ground. JACOB holds on.

All of a sudden the DEMON begins to shrink. JACOB is shocked and

struggles to contain it. As it dwindles in size it reorders its

shape. Within seconds a powerful INSECT is cupped in his hands.

JACOB tries to crush it but it stings with such force that

JACOB's entire body recoils. The stinging persists. JACOB hurls

himself to the ground on top of his arms to hold the CREATURE

down. So massive is the INSECT's attack. however, that JACOB's

whole body heaves off the ground with each sting. Then the

attacks subside. JACOB waits for the next blow.

Suddenly JACOB's body shoots straight up. His hands fly apart as

a new life form erupts between them. He holds on tightly as flesh

and blood mold and expand between his fingers. The new body takes

rapid shape. It is a CHILD. JACOB grasps it with all his might as

it completes its identity. He is horrified when he sees it. It is

his son.

JACOB does not let up. In an instant his SON explodes into a

gelatinous form, constantly undulating and changing shape. Within

its translucent mass a new body is forming. JACOB stares at it

with growing terror. It is himself. A terrible perplexity fills

JACOB's eyes as he struggles to dig in and destroy his own image.

He recoils as his own voice calls out to him.

The words shock him and for the first time, he lets go.

Instantly the image disappears and the jelly-like mass dissolves

into an oily liquid rapidly encircling his feet. JACOB looks down

at the shallow pool spreading out beneath him. Its surface

reflects a smoky, unearthly light.

JACOB gazes into the darkness. He is all alone. The quiet

overwhelms him. The only sound is his own breath. He looks

around, in all directions, but can see nothing. The CAMERA holds

on him as he stands waiting for the next assault, but nothing

comes. He is left only with his anticipation and with hinself. He

stares at the terrible darkness.

A subtle phospheresence begins to glow in the liquid beneath

JACOB's feet. He steps away from it, but it follows his movement.

Suddenly, as if by spontaneous combustion, it bursts into flames.

JACOB screams and tries to run but the flames move with him,

lapping at his legs. He cannot escape them. As far and as fast as

he runs the fire is with him. He yells and cries and screams as

the fire eats at his lower limbs. He falls and jumps back up

again, his hands charred. His eyes grow wild.

Instantly the flames roar and engulf him. It is total

conflagration. JACOB's skin blisters and turns black. His flesh

crackles. Writhing in pain he runs through the flames but can

find no freedom from his suffering.

All at once JACOB stops running. He throws his hands up into the

burning air and stands motionless, in absolute agony. It is a

gesture of total submission and surrender to forces beyond

himself. His flesh bubbles and chars but something is suddenly

quiet inside him.

Through the flames JACOB's dark form can be seen as it slowly

sits down, like a Buddhist monk, in the midst of the holocaust.

He appears a figure of sudden nobility as the flames annihilate

him.

Gradually the fire dies. JACOB's body, his flesh like a charred

and brittle shell, sits motionless, beyond pain. An orange glow

from the embers of his body slowly fades, leaving him in the

final darkness.

The SCREEN stays dark for as long as possible. Then, slowly, an

eerie light appears in an unfamiliar sky. It backlights JACOB,

revealing his silhouette. The CAMERA dollies slowly toward him.

It approaches the burned and unrecognizable remains of JACOB's

face. It is the face of death. The CAMERA holds on the image.

Suddenly, with shocking impact, JACOB's eyes move. Within the

crumbling shell of a body something is still alive, still

conscious. The eyes survey the darkness and the first stirrings

of a new light.

It is dawn. JACOB's dark remains are suffused by a preternatural

glow. Slowly, huge orbs begin to appear on the horizon. JACOB's

eyes open to the growing light as they seek out the familiar in

the still dark lansdcape. Gradually the orbs begin their ascent

like a thousand suns rising at the same time. JACOB's eyes widen

as his new world stands revealed. He is sitting in a GARDEN OF

LIGHT, the Rousseau paradise he has visited once before.

A sudden burst of light fills the sky directly overhead. The

vegetation around him is instantly illuminated with its soft

glow. Like a gentle breeze MICHAEL descends from the light and

stands radiant before JACOB. He smiles and the air itself seems

to brighten. MICHAEL quietly approaches JACOB's body.

JACOB stares at him through dark eyes with a mixture of awe and

disbelief.

Softly MICHAEL places his hands on top of JACOB's head and begins

to peel at the charred flesh. Layer by layer he strips it away.

Then, with an unexpected gesture, he rips away a whole section

with one quick pull. A BLAZE OF LIGHT bursts through the gaping

hole in JACOB's head and beams into the air around them. It is an

astounding sight.

Slowly JACOB begins to stir. He moves feebly at first, like an

old man. His black flesh creaks and cracks and through each

sudden fissure another beam of light blasts out with laserlike

intensity.

JACOB nods in response and takes a huge, gigantic breath. His

lungs expand and suddenly all the old flesh bursts from his body

as a radiant being of light breaks through beneath it. JACOB

stands transfigured, filled with his own luminosity. His face is

like a child's as he stares in amazement at his own hands,

glowing with light.

MICHAEL directs JACOB's vision to the sunrise. It is majestic,

almost Biblical in its grandeur. Great rays of light penetrate

vast cloud formations and descend into the GARDEN. Slowly the

clouds, as if orchestrated by some higher power, begin to part. A

massive light complex emerges from behind them. JACOB watches,

awestruck, as the CELESTIAL STAIRWAY stands revealed. It reaches

down from unknown heights, radiating an infinite power and grace.

It touches down far in the distance, hovering over many acres of

teh GARDEN. JACOB's eyes are filled with its splendor. MICHAEL

looks at him and nods.

JACOB cannot speak. His eyes are fixed on the STAIRWAY dazzling

him from afar. He can see ANGELIC FORMS moving up and down it.

Suddenly, as if transported by light itself, he feels himself

floating up into the air. He looks down upon EDEN sparkling below

him. His mouth is wide open as he soars above it.

The light pulsating from the STAIRWAY is brilliant and thrilling.

JACOB's own inner light intensifies as he approaches it. The

STAIRWAY grows increasingly wondrous as we draw nearer. It pulls

JACOB toward it.

STREAMS OF ANGELS enter the STAIRWAY like a fast flowing river.

It carries them instantly within its current up beyond the

visible reaches of the glittering sky. Billowing clouds glow in a

parade of colors and the starry heavens seem to part as the

STAIRWAY reaches beyond all known dimensions.

JACOB stares at the light that is about to absorb him. It is a

moment of total euphoria. He surges into the stream as the

brilliant light of the STAIRWAY overwhelms the screen.

Slowly the brightness of the screen condenses into a smaller

light source. An overhead surgical lamp remains stubbornly in

view.

INT.  VIETNAM FIELD HOSPITAL - DAY

A DOCTOR leans his head in front of the lamp and removes his

mask. His expression is somber. He shakes his head. His words are

simple and final.

CUT TO JACOB SINGER lying on an operating table in a large ARMY

FIELD TENT in VIET NAM. The DOCTOR steps away. A NURSE rudely

pulls a green sheet up over his head. The DOCTOR turns to one of

the aides and throws up his hands in defeat.

TWO ORDERLIES wheel JACOB's body past rows of other DOCTORS and

NURSES fighting to save lives. A YOUNG VIETNAMESE BOY pulls back

a screen door to let them out of the tent. It is a bright, fresh

morning. The sun is rising.

THE END
