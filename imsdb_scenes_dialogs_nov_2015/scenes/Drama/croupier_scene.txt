FADE IN:

INT. CASINO - NIGHT

A roulette table. The PUNTERS place their bets. TWELVE

PLAYERS, nine men, three women. The FACES of the men, all

ages, intense, hopeful, fearful. Which of them is JACK?

A MAN'S hand spins the wheel. The ball is thrown against

the spin. Hands, faces, chips...

The PUNTERS'S faces as the ball starts to bounce. All eyes

are on the bouncing ball.

The back of the CROUPIER'S hand, his slicked-back short

hair, razor cut. The CAMERA moves around to his face...

whistling sound takes Jack back in time.

INT. PUBLISHER'S OFFICE - DAY

JACK is walking through a maze of open-plan partitioned

offices. He ls casually but fashionably dressed, hair dyed

blond long, a nervous elegance about him, almost

unrecognisable from the croupier's face.

He searches for the right office. He finds it. The name on

the open is GILES CREMORNE.

INT. GILES' OFFICE - DAY

GILES CREMORNE, a public schoolboy in his late twenties

comes forward and vigorously shakes JACK'S hand. Jacketless,

he wears yellow braces. Next to his tidy desk is a slot

machine.

GILES has an upper-class accent, but an acquired street

manner.

GILES frowns at a memory, an implication. GILES'S mobile

phone buzzes. He picks up.

JACK opens a pack of Gitanes.

A WOMAN SECRETARY puts her head into the office.

FIONA puts a fax on GILES'S desk, smiles at JACK, and goes.

He winks at JACK.

GILES pops a coin into the slot machine, pulls the handle,

waits.

The machine spits out several coins. GILES takes them.

JACK nods, extends his hand. A firm handshake.

Meeting over. GILES smiles goodbye, pockets his slot machine

winnings.

INT. JACK'S BASEMENT FLAT - SITTING ROOM -  DAY

The untidy evidence. To the accompaniment of the music, a

discordant version, three dog-eared copies of 'The Invention

Of The Wheel', A Novel by JACK MANFRED. Worn furniture. A

pile of literary magazines. Two elegantly arranged vases

of flowers.  Women's fashion magazines. Books everywhere,

including 'Scarne on Gambling', 'The Education of A Poker

Player', 'Delta of Venus' and other books by Anais Nin. A

woman's dress, back from the cleaners. A framed etching of

Cape Town, South Africa, in the eighteenth century.

Finally...

Beneath the iron barred window, with a view of the iron

steps down from the street, JACK sits at the dining table.

In front of him is a word processor. He toys with a glass

of vodka, smoking a Gitane, and leafing through a soccer

fan magazine. He starts to touch-type, looking at the

screen, not the keyboard. Words appear, letter by letter...

THE BALL... A NOVEL... BY JACK MANFRED. He pauses to drink.

EXT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY

A MAN, face unseen, steps into a phone booth. CLOSE ON:

his hands.  It is impossible to tell where he is.

He opens his pocket book, addresses, diary etc., and

searches through for something.

EXT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY

He finds what he's looking for: a small photograph, among

others of girls, of a ten year-old boy in school uniform.

On the back are three phone numbers, two of them crossed

out. The MAN lifts the receiver, inserts coins. He starts

to press the numbers. There are CLOSE-UPS of his finger

pressing the sequence of digits, each one CLOSER, longer

than the one before, until...

INT. JACK'S SITTING ROOM - DAY

The phone rings. JACK looks to the answering machine, waits

for the voice.

JACK hesitates, then picks up.

EXT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY

The MAN is handsome, tanned, 50ish, white shirt, dark tie.

He is JACK'S father.

The subsequent conversation is INTERCUT between SITTING

ROOM and PHONE BOOTH.

JACK SR pulls out a cigarette - a Gitanes.

JACK stubs his cigarette out.

JACK reaches for a cigarette.

JACK lights up.

As he speaks, he watches passing WOMEN.

JACK is not enthusiastic, but he scribbles the name down

on a pad.

JACK hangs up.

INT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY

Stubbing out his cigarette, JACK SR. leaves the booth. We

now see where he is. A beach bar in South Africa. He walks

to the bar and....goes behind it, slipping on his barman's

jacket. A WOMAN in dark mirror glasses and a bathing suit

is waiting.

INT. JACK'S SITTING ROOM - DAY

JACK, disturbed by the call, pours himself a vodka. He

looks at what he's written: 'THE BALL... A NOVEL BY...

JACK MANFRED.'

JACK inserts a word in the title. It now reads: 'ON THE

BALL'. JACK drinks. After a moment...

He types: 'IN THE BALLS'. Then, on reflection, deletes 'IN

THE'.  Through the iron bars JACK watches feet pass on the

street above. A drunk drops a beer can over. The can falls

in SLOW MOTION but the clatter is loud.

INT. CASINO - DAY

Reception area. The CAMERA turns around the fake glitz of

the interior: brass, drapes, polished wood, mirrors, and

moves towards the front door.

The door opens. Against a blaze of street daylight, JACK'S

silhouette appears. The CAMERA moves forward to greet him.

JACK removes his wristwatch.

INT. CASINO - MANAGER'S OFFICE - DAY

JACK shakes hands with DAVID REYNOLDS, a cold man in his

late forties, dead behind the eyes.

REYNOLDS examines a file in front of him.

REYNOLDS opens the door. He lets JACK go on ahead.

INT. CASINO - HALL - DAY

The full overhead lights give the casino an exposed, tacky

appearance, devoid of mystery or glamour. The place has

roulette tables and blackjack counters. It is deserted

except for several CLEANING LADIES, vacuuming, emptying

ashtrays. REYNOLDS walks with JACK, talking.

REYNOLDS goes to one of the tables with JACK.

He slides open a box and tips 200 chips of varying

denominations onto the table.

JACK starts to stack the chips in piles from a hundred

pounds to five. REYNOLDS watches. JACK'S fingers work fast.

In a matter of moments he has the lot stacked.

He presses a stopwatch in his hand. JACK quickly sets out

four neat piles, three of 100, one of 65. All four piles

are in denominations of ten and five.

He throws a pile of blue and white chips on the table.

The blue are 10, the white are 5.

JACK nods and gets to work. His fingers make Reynolds's

ticking watch seem slow.

INT. CASINO - DAY

Now at a roulette table, REYNOLDS has prepared the bets

for fifteen punters. It's a set-up to test Jack's style

and concentration. REYNOLDS gives JACK the white ball.

JACK spins the wheel, throws the ball against the turn.

As the ball begins to bounce, but before it stops, REYNOLDS

turns to a CLEANING LADY who's emptying some ashtrays

nearby.

The WOMAN looks up, surprised. JACK watches, then catches

sight of REYNOLDS surreptitiously moving a chip onto the

third line.

JACK reaches across, takes the chip and puts it on the

wood Grounding the wheel. REYNOLDS nods approvingly. The

ball stops.

He now rakes away the losers' chips and pays out the

smallest first, before getting to the major pay-out on 23.

It's all very efficient and speedy.

REYNOLDS is increasingly impressed.

JACK takes out a handkerchief.

JACK laughs. REYNOLDS smiles. They like each other.

INT. CASINO - DAY

A blackjack table. JACK is turning cards over for five

punters in an arc. REYNOLDS is moving from one chair to

the next playing each of the five hands.

REYNOLDS looks down at the table.

JACK pulls out the shoe.

REYNOLDS walks away. JACK puts the shoe back. He takes his

watch out of his pocket, glances at it.

INT. CASINO - OFFICE - DAY

Back in the office REYNOLDS is talking to JACK. On

REYNOLDS'S desk is a framed photograph of his suburban

wife and two kids.

REYNOLDS doesn't pursue it.

JACK shakes his head

INT. CASINO - "CROW'S NEST" - DAY

A CCTV Centre over the casino. JACK crosses the room,

looking down through a glass floor at the empty casino

below. REYNOLDS walks over to a series of twenty or more

banked TV monitors with many Video 8 tape decks.

REYNOLDS presses a button. Together they look at a TV

monitor which shows an overlook of a roulette table where

a WOMAN is cheating. REYNOLDS freezes the frame.

INT. CASINO - MANAGER'S OFFICE - DAY

Again in the office. REYNOLDS extends his hand. JACK shakes

it.

Pause.

A HIGH ANGLED SHOT of the office, JACK and REYNOLDS. The

phone rings.

REYNOLDS picks up and listens. The CAMERA descends.

The CAMERA reaches a LOW ANGLE on JACK, looking up.

EXT. CAR - STREETS - TWILIGHT

The street lamps have come on. JACK is at the wheel of a

Sixties Austin-Healey.

EXT. USED CAR LOT - TWILIGHT

Under a canopy of coloured lights A CAR DEALER is walking

round jack's car, examining it.

The DEALER picks at the cracked leather seats, the

protruding stuffing, the chipped dashboard, the rust.

He bends down and looks underneath the car.

The DEALER looks at JACK. JACK stares back. It's as if one

is waiting for the other to blink first. Neither blinks.

JACK leans into the open car and takes out his hat and

cigarettes. He has accepted the offer. The music begins...

INT. UNDERGROUND - NIGHT

... And continues. JACK stands, with an unlit cigarette,

in a crowded moving train. He looks at the faces, MEN and

WOMEN. He sees PEOPLE reading books. He looks at the TITLES:

Romantic fiction, Classics, Business Management, Thrillers,

Self-Help, Cooking....

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

JACK crosses the road. He turns down a side street where

Victorian houses have been converted into flats. There are

scores of 'For Sale' and 'To Let' signs down the street.

He goes down into a basement, closing the iron gate behind

him.

INT. JACK'S BASEMENT FLAT - NIGHT

JACK unlocks the door, goes in, to the accompaniment of

street sounds and a dog barking.

INT. JACK'S FLAT - NIGHT

Radio music is playing from another room. An orchestral

version of 'Try a Little Tenderness'. JACK comes in, hangs

his hat up, looks around. He sees a neatly arranged vase

of flowers that wasn't there before. He goes to the bedroom.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

JACK sees on the bed, an open box and a carrier bag from a

designer department store. Among the white tissue paper is

a simple black silk dress and lace-decorated black

underwear. He smiles and picks up the knickers. He goes to

the open bathroom door, from which comes the music.

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

A radio plays beside the bath. The water is draining away.

MARION NEIL, a red-haired woman in her mid-thirties, wearing

a bathrobe with the name MARION on it is examining the

lines on her neck in the half-steamed bathroom mirror. She

sees JACK, turns with a smile. JACK holds up the black

knickers.

JACK goes to her.

She pushes him gently with the flat of her palms towards

the door.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

JACK comes back into the bedroom. MARION pushes the bathroom

door, not quite closed. JACK tosses the knickers onto the

bed.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

JACK takes the vodka bottle out of the freezer, pours

himself a glass. He sees two bottles of wine opened, food

neatly prepared, ready to cook, an open cook book. He pours

a glass of wine.

INT. SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

JACK sits drinking his vodka. Looking up through the barred

window he sees women's legs passing on the street above.

On the desk beside the computer is the glass of wine.

MARION materialises in the door to the bedroom. She is

made up, wearing the black dress and high-heeled black

shoes, a black scarf around her neck.

JACK takes the glass of wine and gives it to her.

MARION whirls to show off her dress.

He reaches for an envelope on the desk. He gives it to

her. MARION opens it. There are several fifty pound notes

inside.

She raises the glass of wine, drinks.

He drains his glass.

She takes her scarf, puts it round his neck, pulls him

seductively towards the bedroom door.

She winds the black scarf across his face, covering his

eyes.

MARION pulls the scarf from his eyes. She wants to look at

him.

From the street comes the whining sound of a car alarm.

MARION looks deeply into his eyes.

Outside, the car alarm stops. JACK takes MARION'S head in

his hands. She reaches for one of them, examines it.

Their hands interlock. She leads him into the bedroom.

INT. NAIL STUDIO - DAY

JACK'S hands are being worked on by a woman MANICURIST.

The MANICURIST stops for a moment, looks at him with

curiosity.

INT. BARBER SHOP - DAY

A BARBER is cutting JACK'S hair. He goes up JACK'S neck

with electric clippers. Jack's hair is now black.

The BARBER stops for a moment, nonplussed.

INT. CASINO - CHANGING ROOM - DAY

In front of the mirror JACK buttons a white shirt and

skillfully ties a black bow tie. His short hair is lacquered

back. He reaches down for his black jacket... puts it on.

The transformation is complete.

As he scrubs his nails, JACK sees a WOMAN in the mirror.

She is changing her clothes. She pulls off her Indian cotton

dress. She's wearing pants but no bra. Quite

unselfconsciously, not looking Jack's way, she dresses in

her casino clothes.

JACK dries his hands. He turns. The WOMAN smiles at him.

She laughs.

INT. CASINO - ROULETTE TABLE - NIGHT

JACK appears at the head of the table. The PUNTERS look at

him, not recognising him.

A fat INDIAN PUNTER addresses JACK.

A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN trying to look as young as possible

throws 100 pounds in cash to JACK.

She turns to the WOMAN next to her, who looks very similar.

The WOMAN has sensed her friend's interest in JACK. She's

jealous.

JACK pretends he hasn't heard the question. In the

background REYNOLDS is watching as JACK spins the wheel.

INT. CASINO - ROULETTE TABLE - NIGHT

Later. A plastic-looking BLONDE WOMAN, heavily made-up,

sits at the table. She nods to JACK. PUNTERS are placing

their bets. She has 50 casino chips of 100 denominations

in front of her. JACK notes the large sum.

The BLONDE puts 2,500 on red and 2,500 on black. PUNTERS

round the table are astonished at the size of the bet and

the strangeness of betting both red and black.

JACK spins the wheel. Black 10 comes up. JACK takes the

red loss and moves it across the table to the black win.

The BLONDE picks up the 5,000 without a reaction and leaves

the table.

JACK notices that she goes straight to the cashier's desk.

JACK clears the chips away, starts to pay out.

A WHITE-HAIRED MAN on JACK's right speaks to him:

JACK nods.

INT. CASINO - ROULETTE TABLE - NIGHT

Later. A different set of PUNTERS. The wheel spins. A GREEK

MAN sits at the table. He doesn't attempt to bet. He looks

around to see a CROUPIER in his late 20's waiting to replace

JACK at the wheel. This is MATT. He gives JACK a curious

complicitous smile. JACK collects the chips and pays out.

MATT takes over.

REYNOLDS appears and takes JACK'S arm.

At the table, MATT glances at the GREEK man.

INT. CASINO - BLACKJACK TABLE - NIGHT

JACK is now dealing to FIVE PUNTERS. He has a 10 and a 5

exposed for the house. TWO PLAYERS go bust. ONE PLAYER

sticks on 19, the next on 20. The LAST PLAYER buys a card

for 21. JACK turns over an ace for the house. He twists

again. It's a 5 - making 21. The two losing PLAYERS groan.

The LAST PLAYER is paid evens for equalling the house. One

of the PLAYERS who's gone bust gets up, having lost all

his chips, and leaves.

INT. CASINO - NIGHT

Across the casino an Oriental man, MR TCHAI, is walking

towards the table with REYNOLDS. Behind him is a 6 foot 5

bulging BODYGUARD. REYNOLDS comes up to JACK's table.

He moves his chair back, nods at the remaining PLAYERS. MR

TCHAI sits down, watched by the BODYGUARD.

BELLA comes up, smiles sweetly, and takes over from JACK.

TCHAI pulls out a sealed bank packet of 5,000.

REYNOLDS waves to a WAITRESS who comes over.

TCHAI nods. He hands her a 50 note.

The WAITRESS goes. The other PLAYERS at the table look at

MR TCHAI, wondering who he is.

INT. CASINO - NIGHT

REYNOLDS walks with JACK across the casino.

INT. CASINO - CHANGING ROOM - NIGHT

JACK is changing into his street clothes. The young croupier

MATT comes up to him.

JACK shakes his head.

INT. BMW - NIGHT

MATT puts the car into gear, drives off, JACK sitting beside

him.

MATT spins the car round a corner.

INT. FLAT - KITCHEN - NIGHT

JACK pours himself a vodka, smoking a cigarette.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

JACK starts to take his clothes off. MARION is asleep in

bed. She wakes.

Clock beside the bed reads 4.30.

He gets into bed beside her. She takes him in her arms.

She starts to massage his neck, his hair.

INT. BEDROOM - DAY

MARION is dressed in a suit, preparing to leave. She throws

her nightgown into a laundry basket. JACK is asleep. She

bends to kiss him. He wakes.

INT. SITTING ROOM - DAY

MARION drops a set of keys into her bag, glances at JACK'S

covered computer. She draws the curtain back. Daylight

illuminates the old etching of Cape Town.

INT. CASINO - NIGHT

JANI DE VILLIERS is 30-something, blonde, tanned,

expensively dressed in designer clothes. She gives JACK

ten 50 notes.

He slots the cash into the "bank" beneath the table, then

counts out 500 in 20 chips. He slides the chips towards

her, looks at her. She smiles.

There are ten other PEOPLE at the roulette table. An ARABIC-

LOOKING MAN with a moustache behind JANI is looking down

the front of her dress.

Around the table the PUNTERS move their chips onto numbers,

lines, colours. JANI throws three chips to JACK and calls

the numbers:

JACK places them for her.

The wheel spins, 11 is the number. JACK calls the number

and puts the 'dolly' on 11. JANI smiles faintly. JACK pays

out across the table. JANI leaves two chips on 11 The MAN

behind JANI puts his chips on 11.  JANI glances up at him.

She sees the MAN is betting with her. JACK spins the wheel

again. 33 comes up.

INT. CASINO - ROULETTE TABLE - NIGHT

JANI bets again on number 11. The MAN follows suit. The

wheel spins. JACK watches the table. JANI glances at him.

The MAN moves closer to the table to one side of JANI.

Concealed in his hand is a chip. As the ball bounces round

and lands again on number 11, the MAN deftly adds the chip

to the square. JACK clocks it.

REYNOLDS, who has been watching the tables, sees the

beginning of an incident. He comes over. The MAN is getting

angry. JANI watches.

The MAN interrupts JACK and touches JANI's arm.

JACK and REYNOLDS wait. JACK glances at JANI.

He bangs his fist on the felt. JACK waits for REYNOLDS'S

decision. REYNOLDS looks at JACK.

REYNOLDS steps back, JACK pays out JANI and the MAN. The

MAN takes his winnings. He looks at JACK with hatred, then

leaves the table.

REYNOLDS watches him, looks to JACK and nods. JANI collects

her winnings and throws two chips to JACK. She stands up

to leave.

JACK nods and gives her back the two chips.

JACK watches her leave.

JANI heads towards the cashier. JACK sees REYNOLDS arguing

with the irate ARABIC MAN near the entrance.

He looks back to the table.

On his way out the ARABIC MAN looks towards JACK and makes

an occult sign with his hand.

INT. CASINO - NIGHT

It is late. There are few PUNTERS left at the tables. JACK

tidies up his table, which is next to MATT's. He looks

across at MATT and sees the GREEK MAN who was at the table

the first night when MATT took over. The GREEK wins on a

number. MATT clears the table and counts out the GREEK'S

winnings, quickly and efficiently.

JACK stiffens. He sees that something is wrong. MATT moves

piles of chips across to the GREEK, who doesn't look up.

JACK glances in the direction of the hidden video cameras

and the crows' nest. REYNOLDS is in the back-ground, has

seen nothing untoward. JACK watches the GREEK pick up his

winnings and leave.

INT. BMW - NIGHT

Again MATT is driving JACK home.

MATT slams on the brakes. The car comes to an abrupt stop.

MATT turns to JACK, furious.

MATT holds out his hand for JACK. JACK shakes it. MATT

grins.

He puts the car into gear and drives off.

EXT. GREEK RESTAURANT - NIGHT

MATT's car pulls up in the parking lot at the back of the

restaurant.  He and JACK get out of the car and go through

the open kitchen door.

INT. GREEK RESTAURANT - KITCHEN - NIGHT

The kitchen is full of people, some involved in cooking,

some standing around smoking and drinking, mostly Greek.

He shakes hands with a GUY who looks like the owner.

JACK shakes hands too. They cross the kitchen and go through

a bead curtain. Piped Greek music is playing.

INT. RESTAURANT - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

A smoke-filled private dining room. There is a poker game

in Progress. FIVE MEN are playing, a DOZEN GIRLS are dotted

about watching. There is a trestle table laden with Greek

food, from stews to salad, buffet-style. An improvised bar

with ouzo, vodka and wine. It's help-yourself.

JACK pours himself a vodka, scoops up some ice with his

hand from a bucket. Clouds of smoke envelop him. The noise

is close to deafening.

INT. RESTAURANT - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

The poker game. A MAN with fair hair gets up, kisses a

GIRL whose dress is a bathing suit, puts his arm round her

and they wander off. MATT is at the table. JACK is

replenishing his vodka.

GIRL appears behind JACK's shoulder.

The GIRL has a joint in her over-ringed hand. She is dressed

in purple Indian cotton.

She blows smoke in his face. JACK drains his vodka, pours

himself another.

INT. RESTAURANT - LAVATORY - NIGHT

JACK comes into the Gents, another smoke-filled room. Three

or four MEN are arguing over a drug deal, standing in front

of the urinal. One of them has an envelope full of cash,

another a packet of drugs.

JACK goes to a lavatory stall, opens the door. In the stall

the fair-haired MAN who was at Matt's table is sitting on

the lavatory, his trousers round his ankles. The GIRL in

the bathing suit is sitting on his thighs, bobbing up and

down. JACK sees a butterfly tattoo on her left cheek, the

Queen of Spades.

INT. RESTAURANT - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

JACK puts his arm on MATT's shoulder at the poker table.

JACK turns and leaves, helping himself to another drink.

INT. JACK'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

JACK comes to the flat. He is drunk. He starts across the

dark room. Suddenly the light comes on. JACK turns to see

MARION, sitting in a chair in her night-dress.

There is a pause.

JACK has no answer. He goes into the bathroom.

INT. JACK'S FLAT - DAY

The computer is still covered. JACK is standing at the

table dealing cards, practising. One card slips. He swears

silently. He flexes his fingers, cracks his knuckle joints.

He looks at a skirt, legs, high heels, Passing above the

barred window.

EXT. PICCADILLY - EVENING

JACK emerges from the Underground, one of the CROWD.

EXT. PICCADILLY - STORE - EVENING

JACK goes into a large Department Store.

INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - EVENING

MARION is store-walking in the women's underwear department.

It is Sale time. Baskets of tights and knickers on display.

CUSTOMERS are rummaging. She is on the look-out for thieves.

She jumps as JACK places his hand on her hip.

EXT. PICCADILLY - EVENING

JACK pauses in front of an airline office. There is a large

picture of Cape Town, and a special ticket offer.

JANI comes out of the office. Her hair, tied back earlier

in the casino, is now glamorously fluffed out. She sees

JACK. He doesn't see her.

JACK is startled. He doesn't recognise her for a moment.

Then...

INT. RITZ HOTEL - NIGHT

The Art Deco bar. Expensive PEOPLE around. JANI and JACK

are installed on a sofa. A WAITER puts down two Martinis.

JANI laughs out loud.

JANI drinks. JACK notices her wedding ring. JANI catches

the look.

JANI nods, stands up, takes out a notepad and pen. She

looks round feigning conspiracy.

She scribbles her name and phone number on the pad, tears

off the page, gives it to him.

She leaves. JACK watches her go, looks at the page she's

given him.

INT. JACK'S FLAT - NIGHT

In front of a mirror JACK trims his hair with nail scissors.

He is dressed in his croupier's uniform. He straightens

his bow tie.

INT. UNDERGROUND COMPARTMENT - NIGHT

JACK sits in the compartment.

INT. CASINO - ROULETTE TABLE - NIGHT

An ARAB at the end of the table kisses all his 50 chips

and sets them out on the table. The wheel spins. JACK looks

round at the PUNTERS.

The ball bounces, falls on zero. Everybody loses. Many

groans.

A MEDITERRANEAN-LOOKING MAN with a gold bracelet coughs. A

gob of phlegm from his mouth lands on a pile of chips that

JACK is raking away. A WOMAN in her mid-thirties is

appalled.

He coughs again, but into a handkerchief.

JACK clears the piles of chips to one side. He signals to

a SUPERVISOR. The SUPERVISOR hurries over.

The SUPERVISOR signals a WAITRESS over.

She looks at JACK, grimaces, and takes the chips away.

INT. CASINO - NIGHT

The last PUNTERS are leaving. The overhead lights come on.

A CROUPIER is wheeling away a trolley with thousands of

chips. TWO MEN are covering the tables with shrouds.

INT. CASINO - STRONG ROOM - NIGHT

REYNOLDS watches as JACK and MATT count the thousands of

pounds, putting them in piles. Behind them is a large open

safe.

REYNOLDS places the notes in steel boxes.

EXT. CASINO - NIGHT

JACK, comes out. BELLA hurries after him, following him

round the corner.

He straightens his hat and walks off. BELLA walks the other

way.

EXT. STREET. NIGHT

A MAN lurks in the shadows ahead of JACK. JACK doesn't see

him. But as he comes past, the MAN steps out blocking JACK'S

way. He is the Arabic-looking MAN JACK earlier caught

cheating at the casino with JANI.

The MAN reaches forward and grabs JACK'S tie. He yanks it

with farce. JACK gasps. He rams his elbow into the MAN'S

chest.

The MAN kicks JACK on the shins. JACK topples. The MAN

leaps at him. JACK, knees him in the groin.

The fight is untidy and vicious. Both men collapse

struggling onto the pavement.

A car appears, a Mini-Cooper. BELLA is driving. She sees

the fight.

JACK'S nose is bleeding. The MAN kicks him in the back.

JACK yells with pain, gets to his feet.

He boots the MAN in the head. BELLA gets out of her car

and runs over to them.

The MAN is screening under JACK'S repeated blows. BELLA

pulls JACK away.

JACK'S face is masked with blood and fury. BELLA is

frightened by JACK'S violence.

Before she can get JACK into her car, he goes back to the

MAN groaning on the floor. He stamps on the MAN's hand.

BELLA is shocked.

BELLA pulls him away, bundles JACK into her car, gets in,

drives away.

INT. BELLA'S FLAT - BATHROOM - NIGHT

Water is running in the basin. BELLA puts JACK'S jacket on

the lavatory seat. She starts to undo his tie. JACK wipes

his blood-stained nose with a wet flannel.

She undoes his shirt and takes it off. He winces. She washes

his torso, cleans him up.

JACK looks at his shaking hands. BELLA takes him by the

hand, leads him into the bedroom.

INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

She sits him on the bed. The room is lit with coloured

lamps.

JACK pulls her suddenly into his arms, pulls her onto the

bed. She is startled.

JACK'S hands open her blouse. He reaches for her breast.

BELLA'S surprise becomes excitement. He kisses her hungrily,

his hands rummaging in her clothes. She reaches for a side

zip in her skirt.

BELLA kicks off her shoes. There is a burst of passion

between them. For JACK, a continuation of the violence

with the MAN on the street.

For BELLA, it's a sudden release. Her naked foot knocks

over the bedside lamp.

JACK spreads BELLA on the bed. She tugs his trousers down.

He rips her black underwear away.

INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Later. JACK is lying sprawled on the bed with BELLA. She

reaches across him and retrieves the fallen lamp.

JACK strokes her bottom.

BELLA picks up a joint from the bedside and lights it.

JACK looks at her.

JACK hands the joint back to BELLA.

JACK doesn't answer.

BELLA leans over JACK and begins gently to massage his

flesh.

She puts the joint in an ashtray.

BELLA touches a bruise on JACK'S body.

She kisses the bruised skin, pulls him to her. BELLA simply

wants to be held.

INT. JACK'S FLAT - DAY

JACK is at his desk typing intently. There is a pile of

new pages in the sunlight.

MARION passes in the foreground. She kisses him on the

back of his head and leaves. JACK'S fingers move across

the keyboard, dancing.

INT. CASINO - WASHROOM - NIGHT

MATT is shaving.

JACK is scrubbing his nails at a basin.

A YOUNG WOMAN appears in the mirror behind the two MEN.

Her name is PAT. She is dressed like BELLA.

MATT and JACK say 'Hello'. MATT appraises PAT'S appearance,

winks approval at JACK.

JACK is mystified.

INT. CASINO - BLACKJACK TABLE - NIGHT

JACK is dealing to MR TCHAI and three OTHER MEN. One chair

at the table is empty.

JACK shows 13. He turns over his third card, a King. The

bank busts. JACK pays out.

JANI sits down in the vacant chair. JACK conceals his

surprise, a hint of nervousness.

JANI nods impassively.

The MEN look at the glamorous woman. MR TCHAI doesn't

register her presence. He is as inscrutable as his BODYGUARD

who hands him an envelope. JANI takes out money from her

purse. JACK counts it.

JACK slots the money down, counts out 20 50 chips. JACK

deals. Bets are placed. 100 from JANI. The cards turn. MR

TCHAI splits two aces. JANI has a 6 and 7. MR TCHAI receives

two los and wins big. JANI gets a 10 and busts.

JANI'S face is impassive. She receives her cards...

INT. CASINO - NIGHT

JANI busts again. JACK sweeps away the chips, the cards.

JANI reaches into her bag, takes out another thousand

pounds.

The MEN at the table look at JANI.

INT. CASINO - BLACKJACK TABLE - NIGHT

JANI loses again. She is down to 4 chips. She looks up at

JACK. Their eyes meet, hers desperate, his helpless. MR

TCHAI picks up on the look.

JACK glances at the MEN at the table.

JANI places her last bet, glances at the mountain of chips

in front of MR TCHAI. JACK catches her look. He deals.

JANI reaches for her next card. JACK observes her left

hand.

JACK plays out the hand. JANI loses. She immediately gets

up. She is crushed.

She walks away from the table.

TCHAI looks at JACK.

INT. JACK'S BEDROOM/SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

JACK is sitting on the bed fully clothed. He is carefully

sewing a button on his croupier's jacket. Through the open

bedroom door MARION can be seen sitting on the sofa, legs

tucked under her, reading the new typescript.

The phone rings. In the bedroom JACK picks up.

EXT. SOUTH AFRICA CASINO - NIGHT

JACK SR. is in a public phone. Coloured lanterns hang round

in the night. Distant laughter.

INTERCUT between JACK and JACK SR.

In the sitting room MARION looks towards JACK in the

bedroom.

He hangs up. MARION turns the last page of the typescript.

She's finished.

INT. SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

JACK comes in from the bedroom. MARION says nothing. She

puts the typescript down. JACK waits.

MARION gets off the sofa.

JACK sees MARION is getting really angry. He crosses the

room, Pointedly takes MARION'S handbag, opens it, takes

out a National Lottery card and receipt. The doorbell rings.

The doorbell rings again.

JACK hands her the lottery card and goes to the door, opens

it.  BELLA stands there.

MARION watches, numb.

BELLA looks over to MARION.

Without looking at MARION, BELLA suddenly kisses JACK on

the lips. BELLA looks hard at JACK, then leaves. JACK

pursues her.

EXT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

BELLA runs up the iron stairs to the gate at the top.

Without looking back she flings the gate shut, goes off

down the street. JACK turns.

MARION slams the door to the flat. JACK is half-way up the

stairs, alone.

EXT. PICCADILLY DEPARTMENT STORE - EVENING

The rush hour. 6 in the evening. JACK watches MEN and WOMEN

coming out the store.

JACK now sees MARION. He is about to go up to her, moving

through the flow of the crowd, then he stops.

A MAN in his 30s, tall with a moustache, greets MARION.

He's been waiting for her. JACK watches the two of them,

unseen.

The MAN and MARION exchange a few words. She smiles, takes

his arm. He leans forward to kiss her.

JACK turns and walks away.

INT. CASINO - CROWS NEST - NIGHT

JACK stands behind REYNOLDS who is playing back a video of

the earlier incident in which MATT cheated with the GREEK.

He freezes the frame, presses a button, zooms in on the

detail of MATT's hand covering the chips.

On another video monitor MATT is dealing blackjack. REYNOLDS

looks at the screen.

REYNOLDS looks up from the screen.

JACK lights a cigarette.

INT. JACK'S FLAT - DAY

Working at his computer, JACK lights one cigarette from

another. He pauses from his typing. On the desk beside him

is the note with JANI's phone number. He picks up the phone,

starts to dial, then stops, replaces the receiver. He looks

distracted, lost. On the table MARION'S flowers are dead

in the vase.

INT. BOOKSTORE - DAY

JACK comes downstairs from the upper floor. He is looking

at a book he has selected: 'SCARNE ON CARDS'.

Across from the cash desk near the entrance a book signing

is in progress. A small crowd surrounds a Middle Eastern

author called HABIB dressed in a kaftan. GILES is with

him. A PHOTOGRAPHER is there. A few camera flashes.

GILES sees JACK at the cash desk. He is uncertain for a

moment, then smiles.

Hearing his name, JACK turns. GILES comes over.

GILES heads back to the signing. The CASHIER puts JACK'S

book in a bag. GILES stops, thinking of something. He comes

back to JACK.

GILES goes back to his group. JACK looks round the

bookstore, sees thousands of books in piles.

A camera flash.

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

JANI'S white Honda winds its way through the wintry

Oxfordshire countryside. The moon is bright.

INT. HONDA - NIGHT

JANI, wearing dark glasses, is driving. JACK, beside her,

reads a map with a torch.

She turns and smiles at him. Her left hand is bandaged.

The car turns into a lane.

EXT. COUNTRY HOUSE - NIGHT

The Honda's tyres crackle on the gravel drive which leads

to a floodlit yellow stone country house. There are three

cars parked outside the entrance. The Honda stops next to

them.

INT. HONDA - NIGHT

JACK prepares to get out. JANI catches his arm. She takes

off her dark glasses. Her right eye is bruised.

In the distance there is the sound of a tennis ball being

struck.

EXT. COUNTRY HOUSE - TENNIS COURT - NIGHT

A floodlit tennis court. A racquet smacks a tennis ball.

JACK sits with GILES drinking Bloody Marys watching a game

of mixed doubles.

Everybody's wearing sweaters. JANI is playing with one of

GILES'S friends, GORDON. On the other side, two girls,

FIONA from Giles' office, and CHLOE, Gordon's girlfriend.

JACK follows JANI'S game. She is far and away the best of

the four.

GILES is also studying JANI's movements, her knickers when

she serves.

JACK watches JANI'S strong leg muscles as she moves about

the court.

JACK has been waiting for this.

On court, Jani delivers a winning overhead smash. The four

PLAYERS shake hands across the net. They come off the court.

GORDON puts his arm around JANI. His girlfriend CHLOE

notices. JACK is irritated. GILES catches the moment.

JANI moves deliberately away from GORDON, who clearly

fancies her, and sits down beside JACK. She pointedly kisses

him on the cheek. GILES glances at GORDON, who shrugs.

FIONA comes up to GILES.

INT. COUNTRY HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT

JACK and JANI, GILES, GORDON and their two GIRLFRIENDS are

sitting down with drinks at a card table. GORDON opens a

fresh deck of cards.

GILES looks to JANI to persuade him.

JACK is getting angry. JANI is calm.

There is silence. GORDON is embarrassed. FIONA looks at

CHLOE, they're shocked and impressed. JACK smiles.

JACK defuses the atmosphere.

He sits down, picks up the cards.

JACK takes the pack of cards, splits it expertly into two,

shuffles by pressing the two halves together open-palmed.

There is a rattling noise as the cards fold mechanically

into one another, leaving the pack as if it hadn't been

shuffled. FIONA and CHLOE are fascinated.

JACK gives the cards to his right, GORDON cuts them. Another

immaculate professional shuffle, and out come the cards

from JACK'S right hand, flicking across the table.

As the cards land, they fall exactly next to one another

in front of each player.

At the end of the deal, five players are looking at a neat

fan of five cards before them.

They all pick up their cards.

JACK catches JANI's eye. She winks.

INT. COUNTRY HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM - NIGHT

Later. JACK deals the cards.

JANI smiles, says nothing. JACK slides the pack to JANI.

She looks up at him and cuts the cards. JACK deals the

cards deftly. The FIVE PLAYERS pick up their cards.

Before each player calls we hear Jack's voice. In the end

he correctly predicts their call. Is it telepathy? Or

something else?

The PLAYERS examine their hands. The WOMEN are pleased.

The MEN say nothing. JANI puts her cards together.

The betting begins. No one drops out. The raising goes

round three times.

The betting comes to an end. JACK watches as they turn

their hands over. GORDON turns over a Straight.

CHLOE turns over a Flush.

FIONA turns over a Full House.

GILES turns over four of a kind.

Laughter, cries of amazement.

JACK is impassive. They all look to JANI, who turns over,

one card at a time, a Straight Flush.

More laughter, cries of amazement.

JANI leans forward and takes the pot. GILES looks at JACK,

then at JANI.

INT. COUNTRY HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

JACK sits on the side of a four-poster bed and takes off

his shoes. On the other side of the bed JANI unzips her

skirt. She looks round the room.

JANI puts her skirt over a chair and goes into the bathroom.

She doesn't close the door. JACK continues undressing.

From a hold-all he removes a pair of pajamas. He glances

at the open bathroom door, then climbs into his pajamas.

He has two ugly bruises on his chest from the fight with

the ARABIC MAN.

JANI comes out of the bathroom naked. She sees his body.

She walks across to her case, opens it, rummages around

and takes out a nightie. This, without the slightest hint

of embarrassment. JACK goes into the bathroom to brush his

teeth. JANI climbs into bed.

They get into bed.

JANI leans over and turns off the lamp. Her hair brushes

JACK'S face.

INT. COUNTRY HOUSE - NIGHT

In the deserted hall is a nineteenth century painting, a

copy of Gericault's 'Raft of the Medusa'. The picture light

illuminates the group of men and women, clinging to the

raft and to each other.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

JACK wakes drowsily.

JACK sits up, turns on the lamp.

JANI pulls up the bedcover around her body.

JACK gets out of bed, tours the room.

JACK comes right up close to JANI in bed.

JANI gets out of bed.

She puts her hand on his.

She takes his hand and puts it on her bruised eye.

JANI is close to breaking down. Her toughness evaporates.

JANI goes back to bed. She turns out the light. JACK stands

in the middle of the dark room.

INT. COUNTRY HOUSE - PASSAGE - STAIRS - NIGHT

JACK comes out of the bedroom in his pajamas, wearing his

hat. He walks slowly down the passage. He hears the sounds

of love-making coming from one of the rooms. He passes

'The Raft of the Medusa' as he goes down the stairs.

INT. COUNTRY HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

JACK comes into the kitchen, switches on the light. He

goes to the refrigerator, takes out a bottle of vodka. He

washes a dirty glass and pours himself a drink.

He downs his drink, and leaves the kitchen.

INT. COUNTRY HOUSE - PASSAGE - NIGHT

JACK walks back to his room. There is silence now, no sounds

of sex.

INT. COUNTRY HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

JACK comes in, tosses his hat on the bed. JANI isn't in

the bed. The bathroom door is afar. He hears the sounds of

gasping. He rushes to the bathroom.

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

JANI is holding her head over the lavatory bowl. JACK runs

some water in the basin. He helps her to her feet and gives

her a glass of water.

She washes out her mouth. She looks at him, tears running

down her face.

She reaches forward for a toothbrush and starts to clean

her teeth.

She spits the water out of her mouth, kisses him on the

forehead and goes back into the bedroom. JACK looks at his

reflection in the bathroom mirror. He strokes his hair

down.

He leaves the bathroom.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

JACK gets back in bed with JANI. They turn away from each

other and prepare to sleep.

INT. COUNTRY HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAWN

JACK wakes as JANI is dressed getting ready to leave. She

bends and kisses him.

She looks at him then leaves the room

INT. COUNTRY HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

JACK comes into the kitchen. GILES is making coffee. CHLOE

is sitting at the table, half-asleep in her nightgown.

INT. JACK'S FLAT - NIGHT

JACK comes in, puts down his overnight bag. He yawns, heads

for the bedroom. Suddenly, he sees that the vase of dead

flowers is now full of fresh blooms. Underneath is a small

box, gift-wrapped. JACK opens it. Inside the tissue paper

is a tiny gold charm on a chain. He examines it.

CLOSE-UP: The charm is a book, no title engraved.

JACK is touched.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

JACK comes into the room. MARION is in bed asleep. He looks

at her, smiles.

He starts to get undressed. MARION stirs. JACK puts the

book charm around his neck. She moves from the middle to

one side of the bed, making room for him. He holds the

charm.

MARION I haven't brought you much luck, have I? Perhaps we

shouldn't be together.

JACK takes her in his arms.

They begin to make love. She holds the back of his head.

INT. JACK'S FLAT - NIGHT

JACK is asleep in bed with MARION. He is murmuring

indistinguishable words. It wakes her. She gently touches

his shoulder. He opens his eyes.

INT. JACK'S FLAT - DAY

JACK is at work alone. The phone rings. He leaves it and

continues I working. Then he hears JANI'S VOICE.

There is a click. JACK scribbles the number down and resumes

work.

INT. UNDERGROUND - NIGHT

JACK gets off a train. He is dressed as a croupier. He

walks to a public telephone on the platform, taking JANI'S

note from his pocket. He dials the number. The noise of

the train and PASSENGERS makes it difficult to hear. The

phone at the end rings and rings. JACK waits.

He takes out a notepad and writes down the address.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

JACK walks down a street of rough, transient's hotels. The

street lamps are on.

He comes up to a hotel called 'Journey's End'. He goes in.

INT. HOTEL. STAIRS - NIGHT

JACK climbs the creaking stairs under the fluorescent

lights. He knocks on a door. JANI opens it. She wears men's

pajamas. She looks unslept.

She glances up and down the passage. JACK goes in.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

JANI carefully closes the door. JACK looks round the dingy

room.

She switches on a standard lamp, looks at him.

Reflected in a mirror, she opens her bag and takes out an

envelope, gives it to JACK. He looks inside. Four bank

packets of 2500.

JACK looks at her hand.

She crosses to pick up a bottle of Scotch.

JACK puts the envelope in his pocket. They look at each

other.

JACK goes up to JANI and kisses her on the mouth. She puts

an arm around him.

He turns and leaves the room.

EXT. HOTEL - STREET - NIGHT

JACK comes out of the hotel, walks up the street.

INT. CASINO - NIGHT

At the roulette table JACK spins the wheel, throws the

ball.

A MIDDLE-AGED MAN is sweating. He fingers his last 2 chips.

He reaches for a number, hesitates. JACK sees that the

MAN's hand is shaking.

Across the table a well-dressed JEWISH WOMAN in her fifties

is sitting next to a YOUNG MAN, a gigolo type, the top

three buttons of his shirt undone. She too hesitates with

her bet, looks down at her card, marked with the last thirty

turns.

The WOMAN looks up at the YOUNG MAN. She hands him the

chip.

The YOUNG MAN smiles. Takes the chip and puts it on 21.

The MIDDLE-AGED MAN puts his chips on 8 and 11. He prays

silently.

INT. CASINO - NIGHT

The roulette table. The ball is bouncing in and out of

numbers.

The MIDDLE-AGED MAN closes his eyes. The WOMAN puts her

hand on the YOUNG MAN'S arm.

The ball bounces into 21. The WOMAN gives a cry of joy.

She grips the YOUNG MAN's hand. He leans over to her, eyeing

her diamond necklace, and whispers something seductive in

her ear. She stiffens with apprehensive pleasure.

The MIDDLE-AGED MAN opens his eyes, there is a look of

misery on his face.

JACK sweeps away the lost chips, pays out five minor

winners. He calmly counts a small pile of chips and slides

them to the MIDDLE-AGED MAN by sleight of hand. Then he

prepares to pay out the WOMAN.

No one has noticed the pay-out to the MIDDLE-AGED MAN. The

MAN looks at JACK incredulously. JACK smiles mechanically.

The MAN mouths the words 'Thank you' to JACK.

The WOMAN looks up at the YOUNG MAN. She gives him a pile

of chips. He gives them back. He kisses her neck.

The MIDDLE-AGED MAN stands up, his face creased in emotion,

relief.

JACK converts the green coloured chips to 35 in house

chips. The MAN nods at JACK, who smiles formally.

The MAN leaves the table. PUNTERS place their bets for the

next spin. JACK sees the MAN stop by the next roulette

table.

The MAN hesitates. He can't resist.

In CLOSE-UP: the MAN puts two of the chips down.

INT. JACK'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

MARION drops a plate as she's drying the dishes. She swears

and bends to pick up the pieces.

INT. JACK'S FLAT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

MARION, undressed, pulls the old nightgown from the laundry

basket. She lets it fall back, goes to look in the chest

of drawers for another. She can't find one among the

underwear.

She goes on to JACK'S drawer and pulls out a shirt. She

unfolds it. Out drop the four packets of 2500.

She bends to pick them up. She looks at them incredulously.

INT. CASINO - BLACKJACK TABLE - NIGHT

JACK pushes several 50 notes into the slot and counts out

two piles of chips for a PUNTER in front of him.

JACK'S FACE as he deals.

INT. CASINO - ROULETTE TABLE - NIGHT

The FACES of PUNTERS around the table: concentration,

grimness, apprehension...

The white balls lands. The FACES of the LOSERS, resigned,

desperate, angry....

The PUNTERS who are cleaned out get off their chairs, tear

up their sequence cards, turn and walk away, quickly,

slowly.

ON JACK'S FACE:

INT. JACK'S FLAT - NIGHT

MARION is lying awake alone in bed. The phone rings. She

leans over to pick it up, then doesn't. From the sitting

room comes the message:

Click. MARION gets out of bed. She goes into the sitting

room.

INT. SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

MARION replays the message. She stares at the phone. Then

carefully she presses the ERASE button, wiping the message.

She goes back into the bedroom.

INT. JACK'S FLAT - DAY

JACK is at work. MARION'S hands are massaging his shoulders.

The little book charm dangles round his neck.

She takes her hands away from his neck.

The sound of an underground train.

INT. UNDERGROUND - NIGHT

JACK sits impassively among noisy Christmas TRAVELLERS.

The train stops. SOMEONE pops a balloon. JACK gets up and

alights, followed by a streamer. He disappears into the

crowd.

INT. CASINO - CHANGING ROOM - NIGHT

JACK hangs up his hat and coat, examines himself in the

mirror. He picks up a small roll of paper. He unfurls it.

A Christmas party hat.

INT. CASINO - NIGHT

A Christmas festive atmosphere. The casino interior is

decorated with red and green balloons, silver and gold

streamers, a large tree hung with 1000 chips.

JACK is dealing at a blackjack table. Like the other

croupiers and dealers, he is dressed in a fancy red coat

with green trim. He wears a silly paper hat.

The PUNTERS at Jack's table include MR TCHAI and four

expensively dressed CHINESE MEN. The BODYGUARD stands behind

them. They are gambling big money. Wads of 50 notes are

changed into 100 chips.

JACK is coolly winning for the house. REYNOLDS looks on

impassively in his Santa Claus suit. Three or four PUNTERS

are watching the CHINESE lose heavily. MR TCHAI and his

friends occasionally exchange a phrase in Chinese but they

show no emotion as they lose. With each hand they prepare

to lose even more. JACK pushes hundreds of pounds into the

box beneath the table.

REYNOLDS signals a SECURITY MAN to collect the cash which

is building up. He comes over with a safety cart. During a

short break the money is taken from under the table in a

box, loaded into the cart and wheeled away.

INT. CASINO - BAR - NIGHT

TWO COLD-LOOKING MEN in suits are drinking mineral water

at the bar. They watch the SECURITY MAN with the cart pass

by and disappear through a green baize door marked PRIVATE.

One of the SUITS looks at his watch: five minutes to

midnight.

INT. CASINO - NIGHT

JACK is now at a roulette table. He sees a PUNTER's watch:

2.45. The atmosphere around the crowded table is noisy,

laughter, loud voices. 1 One of the two MEN in suits from

the bar eases himself into a chair. JACK sees him. The

SUIT throws him 500.

JACK gives him ten pale blue chips and puts another pale

blue chip into the rack alongside the rainbow of colours

used by the other punters. The SUIT looks at his watch.

INT. CASINO - NIGHT

Two men in raincoats, DETECTIVES, approach REYNOLDS and

talk to him. REYNOLDS becomes nervous, looks around the

casino. The table at the bar where the SUITS sat is empty.

The PRIVATE green baize door slowly closes.

INT. CASINO - NIGHT

The ball bounces into number 5. There are cheers of delight

from the winners, 5 is heavily covered.

The SUIT casually slides a pale blue chip onto the number

at the side.

JACK Sees the obvious cheat. So do other PUNTERS.

The SUIT gets up and comes around the table to JACK.

JACK pushes him away. The SUIT hits JACK'S face with his

fist. Uproar around the table. JACK hits the man. The SUIT

grabs JACK and pushes him backwards across the table,

knocking all the chips over. The PUNTERS start shouting.

They grab their chips, especially the losers. One PUNTER

tries to restrain the SUIT. JACK kicks the SUIT hard. They

fight, trading blows.

At the blackjack table MR TCHAI and the other CHINESE see

the fight. MR TCHAI barks at the BODYGUARD in Chinese. The

BODYGUARD heads for the fight at the roulette table.

TWO DEALERS rush over to stop the fight. Somewhere in the

distance there is the sound of a gunshot. PEOPLE start

screaming. The SUIT punches JACK in the stomach. JACK

doubles up. The SUIT breaks away, rushes across the casino,

pushing screaming WOMEN aside, heads for the door. MR

TCHAI's BODYGUARD blocks his way and fells the SUIT with a

hammer blow to the head.

The TWO DETECTIVES come up. One of them handcuffs the SUIT,

who is lying on the floor. The casino is in uproar. A

strange, violent Christmas party.

INT. CASINO - NIGHT

JACK lies groaning on the floor. MR TCHAI is standing,

watching JACK. REYNOLDS'S VOICE comes over the tannoy

system:

REYNOLDS'S VOICE is replaced by a breezy version of 'Rudolph

the Red-Nosed Reindeer'. JACK struggles to his feet, amid

the chaos. He falls back in pain. MR TCHAI and the other

CHINESE leave the casino with the BODYGUARD.

INT. HOSPITAL - CASUALTY - NIGHT

JACK is sitting in a Christmas-decorated cubicle, a curtain

drawn round. An INDIAN NURSE is bandaging his arm. He has

two large plasters on his chest.

The NURSE finishes the job, smiles.

She hands him two pills and a glass of water. In the

background there are party sounds. The NURSE leaves. JACK

fingers the charm around his neck.

There is a pause. Then the curtain is pulled back. MARION

enters. She carries a bottle of wine and two cartons of

Chinese take-away. JACK is surprised.

She starts to pour wine. JACK is still puzzled.

MARION hands him a glass of wine.

They touch glasses and drink.

As she opens the cartons, JACK watches her, still uneasy.

JACK sinks back on the bed. She hands him the rice dish.

MARION kisses him.

INT. CASINO - REYNOLDS'S OFFICE - DAY

JACK sits in front of REYNOLDS.

He hands JACK an envelope.

He opens the envelope. Inside is a casino cheque for 500.

INT. JACK'S FLAT - NIGHT

JACK is sitting at his computer, drinking vodka, dressed

in his CROUPIER'S suit.

He types... On the SOUNDTRACK we hear the CASINO noise.

There's a ring at the doorbell. He looks at his watch:

2.15a.m. The I ring comes again.

JACK goes to the door.

At the door. It was pay-back time. JACK goes to the door.

JACK calmly opens the door. A UNIFORMED POLICEMAN stands

there. JACK hadn't expected this.

The sound of the roulette ball bouncing against the numbers.

INT. MORGUE - NIGHT

A POLICE DOCTOR uncovers a body on a gurney. The sound of

the ball find-ing a number. JACK can hardly bear to look.

It is MARION. With emotion...

JACK looks away from MARION'S face. He sees the MAN with

the moustache, standing on the other side of the gurney,

the MAN he saw with MARION on the street. He is DETECTIVE

INSPECTOR ROSS. JACK is disorientated.

He grabs ROSS'S lapels. ROSS carefully removes JACK'S hands.

JACK fumbles in his pocket for a cigarette. There is a No

Smoking sign on the wall. ROSS produces a Zippo and lights

JACK'S Gitane.

ROSS sighs, looks at MARION.

JACK suddenly reaches down and pulls the white sheet back

over MARION'S face.

ROSS is puzzled. JACK drops his cigarette on the floor,

grinds it with his shoe. ROSS gives JACK his card.

JACK walks away from ROSS without a word. The DOCTOR is

now filling out a form.

From the door JACK looks back. ROSS waits for him to say

something. JACK doesn't speak.

There is a REPRISE of JACK covering MARION'S face with the

sheet.

EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

In his croupier's suit JACK walks the night streets.

He passes a poster for the National Lottery bearing the

legend: 'IT COULD BE YOU'. JACK doesn't see it.

INT. GREEK RESTAURANT - NIGHT

A WOMAN smashes a plate over a MAN'S head. It's plate-

smashing party time, Greek-style. TWENTY drunk PEOPLE having

fun. Zorba music. Plates are thrown, stamped on, smashed.

JACK sits alone at a corner table, drinking, watching the

fun, unsmiling. One plate cracks into a wall behind him. A

MAN stumbles backwards into JACK's table. JACK swiftly

moves his drink out of the way. The MAN apologises, turns

to JACK. It is MATT.

MATT has to shout above the noise and music. JACK smiles.

MATT doesn't hear.

INT. GREEK RESTAURANT - NIGHT

There are four or five PEOPLE left among the debris. MATT

has gone.

JACK is still there, drunk now.

A BLACK WOMAN comes over to him. Her name is LUCY.

EXT. GREEK RESTAURANT - DAWN

LUCY guides JACK to a parked car. He is drunker than she.

When he sees the car he starts to laugh. It is his Austin

Healey.

She opens the door for him. They climb in. LUCY starts the

car.

They drive off.

EXT. STREET - DAWN

A deserted intersection. The Austin Healey swings around a

corner.  A WOMAN steps out from the kerb.

INT. CAR - DAWN

JACK reacts. He swings the wheel. LUCY shouts. The car

swerves, missing the WOMAN.

JACK looks back. The WOMAN is shouting after the car.

INT. JACK'S FLAT - DAWN

JACK sits at his computer. He is watching the printer

unloading page after page. JACK assembles the typescript.

CLOSE UP: The dedication: 'To Marion'.

The sound of the ball bouncing against the wheel.

INT. CASINO - NIGHT

The ball falls into 10. JACK puts the doll on 10.

No one at the table has the winning number. JACK sweeps

away the losing bets.

INT. CASINO - NIGHT

A Blackjack table. The bets are placed. JACK turns over

the bank's cards: a KING and an ACE. He takes all the chips

from the five PUNTERS.

EXT. STREET. BOOKSTORE - NIGHT

JACK comes up to a bookstore window. A sticker reads: 'IT'S

A WINNER'. There are quotes blown up from the reviews: "AN

INCREDIBLE INSIDE JOB...IT'S ALL HERE, THE SYSTEMS, THE

SCAMS, THE SLEAZE...A TALE OF TRIUMPHANT DISGUST...OF

EXHILARATING CONTEMPT..." The display is just one book:

'I, CROUPIER'. Number 1 Bestseller.

INT. REYNOLDS'S OFFICE - NIGHT

REYNOLDS is reading the book. He laughs out loud at

something.

INT. UNDERGROUND - NIGHT

JACK is sitting in his croupier's suit on the crowded tube.

He sees a WOMAN reading 'I, CROUPIER'. For the first time

we see the back cover...'by ANONYMOUS'.

INT. JACK'S FLAT - DAWN

Five in the morning.

JACK comes in. The phone rings.

INT. SUN CITY. CASINO - NIGHT

JANI is holding a mobile phone. In the background is the

casino room, the lights, colours, rattling sounds. She

waits.

INT. JACK'S FLAT - NIGHT

JACK hesitates, then picks up.

The following conversation is INTERCUT.

JACK waits.

INT. CASINO - NIGHT

A MAN'S hand takes the phone from JANI.

INT. JACK'S FLAT - NIGHT

INT. CASINO - NIGHT

JACK SR. his arm round JANI, talks into the phone.

INT. JACK'S FLAT - NIGHT

JACK'S face is a mask, tight, fixed.

JACK slowly puts the phone down. He takes a deep breath.

Then smiles.

CLOSE-UP: A copy of the book: 'I CROUPIER'.

INT. JACK'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

Laughing, JACK pours himself a vodka, raises his glass.

He drinks at a gulp. He turns. Standing in the doorway is

BELLA, wearing a nightdress. She is sleepy.

BELLA puts her arms around him lovingly.

A whistling sound...

INT. CASINO - NIGHT

We are back in the FIRST SCENE. The ball bounces around

the spinning wheel. The FACES of the PUNTERS. Frozen

expressions. They are almost still. We do not see the

croupier. Then...

Nothing moves except the little white ball in the spinning

wheel. The ball slows...

JACK'S face. A hint of a smile.

The ball falls into green Zero. JACK rakes all the chips

off the table. There are no winners. The film ends on a

CLOSE-UP of JACK'S face. A look of calm satisfaction.

THE END
