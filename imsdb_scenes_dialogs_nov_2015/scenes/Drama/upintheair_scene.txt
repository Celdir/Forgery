Secure your own mask before assisting others.

A SPOTLIGHT reveals RYAN BINGHAM standing at a PODIUM.

He unzips a BACKPACK and sets it down beside him.

Ryan pauses to let us consider this.

Ryan takes a beat to let the weight sink in.

We hear people around us chuckling. Ryan smiles. Reveal:

INT. HOTEL CONFERENCE ROOM - AFTERNOON

The kind that shifts between lower income corporate retreats

and lower income weddings.

The few dozen people seem to be visualizing as told.

We see nodding. People's gears turning.

A titter through the crowd.

INT. BOEING 757 - DAY

A FEMALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT is looking directly at us.

Turn to see RYAN looking back.

Handsome. Anonymous. Right now - Confused.

Ryan furrows - What the hell is going on here?

The flight attendant raises her hand to reveal a CAN OF SODA.

The flight attendant moves to the next aisle. Ryan takes a

beat, then returns to his work.

INT. SMALL CONFERENCE ROOM, SUN CASUALTY - DAY

Two words - Subordinate chic.

Seated at a tiny table is RYAN. The Grim Reaper in a suit.

We see a series of REAL PEOPLE react to the news of being

fired. They should be non-actors (actual victims of recent

layoffs) that can react organically to the news with

authenticity. Some are hurt. Others are upset and even

abusive. The series concludes with...

STEVE (AN ACTOR)

... who's on the verge of tears.

FREEZE on Ryan.

INT. STEVE'S CUBICLE - DAY

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Steve in a small meeting.

his coworkers on a coffee break.

INT. SMALL CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Steve is trying to hold it together.

Steve scoffs at this.

Ryan slides Steve a PACKET.

And just for a moment, Steve looks hopeful.

Steve begins removing it from his wallet.

Steve nods and gets up to leave. Just as he's about to walk

out, he stops and turns back.

Steve nods and exits the room.

INT. RYAN'S ROOM - PHOENIX HILTON - DAY

The choreography of Ryan's packing is worthy of Tchaikovsky.

A coat slides off a hanger... A travel toothbrush folds

closed like a switchblade... A briefcase clicks onto a roll-

away bag... A hand flips a light switch without looking.

INT. LOBBY, PHOENIX HILTON - DAY

Ryan is at the check out desk.

Ryan smiles... "Do I?"

He hands it to her, close enough to camera, that we get a

nice big close up of it. She runs the card and the screen

pops up with information that makes her blush.

Ryan nods in faux modesty.

EXT. OUTDOOR CAR RETURN, HERTZ RENT-A-CAR - DAY

Ryan pulls up to one of the spaces marked with the #1 GOLD

PRESIDENTS CLUB emblem. He hops out and a uniformed man with a

handheld device begins to punch in the license plate number.

Ryan pulls out his HERTZ PRESIDENTS CLUB CARD and places it

nice and close to lens so we can see it.

The card slides through the handheld device and we see the

DIGITAL NUMBER increase by a few thousand points.

INT. MAIN CONCOURSE, PHOENIX SKY HARBOR INTL AIRPORT - DAY

The automated GLASS DOORS slide open. Ryan enters the

concourse and takes a deep breath of the temperately

controlled air. He has arrived.

Subtitles - "Airworld"

Ryan skips the long lines and steps directly into the

AAdvantage Executive Platinum line.

Glorious close-up of Ryan's AAdvantage Executive Platinum

CARD sliding through the AUTOMATED MACHINE. Were it any

sexier, we'd hear a moan. Maybe we even do.

Immediately, the AIRPORT CLERK registers and perks up.

We see it again...

Ryan nods back to the clerk.

Ryan continues to hit buttons, swiftly checking in.

A ticket begins printing. Ryan snaps it up.

INT. SECURITY - PHOENIX SKY HARBOR INTL AIRPORT - SAME

Ryan steps up and observes his line choices. He finds a few

Asian businessmen and hops in behind them.

RYAN MOVING THROUGH THE SECURITY SCREENING

It's a beautiful choreographed ballet of a bag handle

collapsing, shoes coming off, a laptop going in a separate

tray, wallet and watch sliding into a shoe, a boarding card

sliding into a back pocket... both hands always moving,

performing separate actions... It really is gorgeous.

INT. AMERICAN ADMIRALS CLUB - SAME

Ryan enters and presents his ADMIRALS CLUB CARD. It has a

hologram. The ADMIRALS CLUB HOSTESS immediately smiles.

Ryan walks past a stack of newspapers on the way to the

buffet, the whole time framed by an enormous window

overlooking the tarmac.

With that comment, Ryan slides into a leather club seat. A

DIGITAL DISPLAY reads: "Thank You For Your Loyalty".

He opens his briefcase and pulls out his ITINERARY. He scans

it. We see a string of flights, car rentals, and stays at

Hitons. Then, something makes him frown. He pulls out his

cell phone and dials...

INT. ASSISTANT'S DESK, CTC - DAY

Ryan's assistant, Kevin, is not happy to be there.

Ryan pauses.

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

We push in on an EASEL with a SIGN that features RYAN'S

HEADSHOT. Underneath his name, it reads: "What's In Your

Backpack?"

INT. SMALL CONFERENCE ROOM, HOTEL - NIGHT

Ryan delivers his speech with a smile.

INT. ADMIRALS CLUB - SAME

Kevin examines the invitation emblazoned with a big "XX".

Four words - Store-bought sports memorabilia.

Craig checks out a CUTE INTERN.

INT. BOEING 757 - DAY

Ryan sits one row behind the bulkhead. Left side. Aisle.

Reveal - A man next to Ryan. Some BUSINESSMAN between cities.

He talks, drink in hand, but we don't hear him.

BUSINESSMAN AND RYAN MAKING SUGGESTIONS

BUSINESSMAN TELLS A JOKE. HIS HANDS GESTURE.

Ryan laughs out loud.

TURBULENCE. THE BUSINESSMAN TIGHTENS HIS SEAT BELT.

THE MAN SPEAKS ABOUT SOMETHING THAT OBVIOUSLY DISTURBS HIM.

THE MAN LEANS BACK, ARMS CROSSED, WITH A FAR OFF LOOK.

EXT. TARMAC, DALLAS FORT WORTH AIRPORT - DAY

Their PLANE LANDS.

INT. BOEING 757 - DAY

As the plane begins to taxi to the gate, both Ryan and the

Businessman pull out their cards.

The dull bell "dings" to let us know it's safe to stand. Ryan

and the Businessman get up and open the overheads.

INT. CONCOURSE, DALLAS FORT WORTH AIRPORT - DAY

Ryan and the Businessman walk next to each, now completely

ignoring each other as if they never shared a word.

Ryan and the Businessman reach a point that separates -

CONNECTING FLIGHTS go left / LONG TERM PARKING goes right.

They share an awkward smile with a nod, then head in their

separate directions.

INT. BROOKS BROTHERS, DALLAS FORT WORTH AIRPORT - DAY

Ryan is checking out TIES when his cell phone rings. He

checks the I.D.- UNAVAILABLE. He weighs it for a second.

Ryan mouths a silent "fuck".

INT. KARA'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

Kara is Ryan's sister. Her home overflows with books, photos,

family collectables, and kid's artwork.

It just so happens that Kara is GLUING her daughter's school

project mobile together.

Ryan exits the store and we realize we are in...

INT. CONCOURSE, DALLAS FORT WORTH AIRPORT - DAY

Ryan hops onto a PEOPLE MOVER.

Ryan rolls his eyes.

Yeah.

We've been sending people these kits

so they can print out photos of Julie

and Jim on cardboard, and take photos

of them in interesting places kind of

like that gnome in the French movie.

Why?

Because it's Julie's wedding... and she

thinks it's fun. Does it matter why?

How is Julie?

Would you call her? She thinks

you've turned to butter -

Disappeared. You're awfully

isolated, the way you live.

Isolated? I'm surrounded.

Your assistant told me you're going

to be in Vegas.

Did he?

Can you get a photo of the cut-out

in front of the Luxor Pyramid?

That place is a shit hole. No one

stays there.

Jesus, Ryan, I'm not asking you to check

in. Can you just take a stupid photo?

I'm going to try my best.

Well, thank you for trying your best.

INT. BAR LOUNGE - HOUSTON HILTON - EVENING

Ryan sits at one of the couch & table set-ups. He's going

over some paperwork. He notices an attractive professionally

dressed woman, ALEX, sifting through her purse. She sets a

pair of car keys with a MAESTRO TAG on the table.

Ryan is intrigued.

After a beat.

She breaks into a smile.

INT. BAR LOUNGE - HOUSTON HILTON - LATER THAT EVENING

Empty glasses litter the table. Ryan and Alex have taken over

a couch and have the contents of their wallets spread out -

All MEMBERSHIP CARDS.

Alex grabs Ryan's AMERICAN CONCIERGE KEY CARD.

Oh my God. I've heard about these,

but never seen one in person. Is

this a...?

Concierge Key. Yeah.

I love the weight.

Graphite. I was pretty excited the

day that puppy came in.

I'll say. I put up pretty

pedestrian numbers. Sixty thou a

year, domestic.

That's not bad.

Don't patronize me. What's your total?

That's a personal question.

Oh please...

I hardly know you.

Show some hubris. Impress me.

I bet it's huge.

You have no idea.

Come on...

Is it this big?

... this big?

Alex smiles, fair enough. Admires the CONCIERGE KEY CARD.

Alex looks into Ryan's eyes and gives him unspoken permission

to take her right there and then.

INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT

Ryan and Alex walk down a curved corridor, suppressing

laughter. There's no adult way to go back to somebody's

hotel room. Once at the door, Ryan tries his KEY CARD, but

it doesn't work.

He reaches into his pocket and comes up with five other key

cards from recent trips.

He tries a couple.

Ryan chuckles. He finds the right key and opens the door.

INT. RYAN'S SUITE, HOUSTON HILTON - LATER THAT NIGHT

Everything is scattered from a marathon Fuck. Ryan and Alex

are laying on the bed, sprawled out on their backs like

murder victims.

TWO LAPTOPS SIDE BY SIDE

They simultaneously type each other into their calendars.

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Ryan drops Alex off at her door. She flips the "do not

disturb" on her door handle and kisses Ryan good night.

The door closes. Ryan smiles to himself.

EXT. HOUSTON HILTON - NEXT MORNING

Sprinklers doing their job. One's broken.

EXT. HOUSTON HILTON - MORNING

Looking through the first floor window, we see Ryan doing

and has a tiny orgasm right there.

INT. BOEING 757 - DAY

Ryan looks out the OVAL WINDOW to the landscape of Omaha.

INT. KISS-N-FLY, EPPLEY AIRFIELD - DAY

Ryan wheels passed a couple that leaps into each other's arms.

EXT. RYAN'S APARTMENT BUILDING, OMAHA - DAY

Ryan steps up to an upscale building with little character,

searching for his keys at the bottom of his bag. Finally

finds them and opens the front door.

INT. ELEVATOR, RYAN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Ryan presses his floor, when a NOSEY NEIGHBOR slides in.

Ding! - Ryan gets off at his floor.

INT. RYAN'S APARTMENT, OMAHA - DAY

Ryan walks in and sets his bag down. Reveal - the place is

empty... Like empty, empty.

Ryan opens the fridge - Chinese take out. Pizza box. Bottle

of Vodka. Takes a whiff of something - not good.

Ryan turns to find Dianne, a pretty woman just shy of forty.

They hug - It's just intimate enough to know they've violated

the rules of sleeping with your neighbors.

Ryan opens it and finds the CUT-OUT of his sister Julie and

her fiance Jim. It's an eighteen inch card stock photo of Jim

hugging Julie from behind.

They share a smile. Then, Dianne goes to leave.

Dianne gets a little uncomfortable.

Dianne gives a smile/nod and exits. Ryan take another long

look at the CUT-OUT. He shakes his head.

EXT. CTC HEADQUARTERS, CTC - MORNING

A downtown midsize high rise.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

The company has piled in, standing room only. Assistants and

interns watch through the windows.

Craig addresses the group including his own superiors.

A couple odd looks from road warriors a decade his senior.

A strangely encouraged response from the group.

Natalie stands up.

Natalie clicks on her POWER POINT PRESENTATION.

POWER POINT SLIDE: "GLOCAL"

Everyone including Ryan attempts to pronounce it.

POWER POINT SLIDE: "GLOBAL ---> LOCAL"

POWER POINT SLIDE: A slide shows PEOPLE X 250.

She turns around and fires up her monitor. Sitting in a video

conference session is a young man in a suit.

Various people say hello to Ned.

Ned smiles. People chuckle in the conference room. One guy

jokes "Don't count on it."

Natalie turns to the monitor and proceeds to fire Ned. It is

a pretty dry process and lacks Ryan's charm.

Ned picks up the packet.

Ned starts to peruse the packet with fake interest.

Ned gets up and goes to leave.

People clap and tease him a little.

POWER POINT: An animation of one monitor becoming multiple

monitors, all tied into a central switch board in the middle

of a map of the country.

Ryan is in a state of silent panic.

INT. CRAIG GREGORY'S OFFICE, CTC - MOMENTS LATER

Ryan enters and stops short.

A beat.

Ryan rolls his eyes.

Craig's door opens and Natalie pops her head in.

Craig goes to wave her off.

Natalie is confused but takes the chair next to Ryan.

Natalie and Ryan hold a look for a second.

Ryan and Natalie turn to face each other.

Ryan gets up. Natalie gets up too.

Ryan sits back down.

Ryan stops.

INT. RYAN'S OFFICE, CTC - DAY

Ryan is staring out his window watching a plane take flight.

Craig enters.

Ryan shoots a look.

A beat as Ryan registers what Craig means: The Road.

Craig cups one of his hands and places a FOLDED POST-IT

between his fingers like a ship's sail.

Craig raises his other finger far away.

A beat of Ryan taking in this ridiculous illustration.

Ryan churns.

INT. RYAN'S APARTMENT - DAY

Ryan is packing his ROLL-AWAY BAG. It is practiced and

systematic. He's just about finished, when he notices the CUT-

OUT of his sister's engagement photo.

He tries placing it in the open bag, but it is immediately

clear that the photo is two inches to long. He tries putting

it on an angle, but that doesn't help.

Ryan centers the cut-out again and tries to ZIP around it,

but he can't get the zipper around the HEADS of the photo.

For a moment, it almost seems like he's assaulting their tiny

head with the zipper handle. Doesn't help.

A moment of silent frustration.

Being pulled through an airport. The little heads of Ryan's

sister and her fiance are poking out the top of the bag. The

two zippers have been closed on either side of them as though

they were tiny passengers peeking out the sunroof.

INT. EPPLEY AIRFIELD, OMAHA - MORNING

Ryan cuts right through the crowd, wheeling his carry-on

towards the automatic check-in machines.

Ryan stops when he notices NATALIE saying goodbye to her

BOYFRIEND - a kind of Hollister looking guy in his mid-

twenties. He's not thrilled by the public affection. After a

beat, they break and he exits.

Natalie sees Ryan and starts dragging her LARGE SUITCASE

towards him. The SCRAPING against the terrazzo sends a shiver

up Ryan's spine.

She arrives and sets the heavy bag down with a CLUNK. Ryan

stares at her travel case for a beat then up to her.

A ROW OF ROLL AWAY BAGS

INT. LUGGAGE STORE, EPPLEY AIRFIELD - MORNING

Ryan pulls one out and tests the action.

INT. TERMINAL FLOOR, EPPLEY AIRFIELD - MORNING

Natalie is attempting to repack her new bag in the middle of

the airport. Ryan helps by throwing a couple things out.

INT. SECURITY, EPPLEY AIRFIELD- MORNING

Ryan spots various "bad lines", then sees a group of Asians.

Ryan starts walking.

As they pass the first line - A FAMILY OF SIX.

Second Line - AN ELDERLY COUPLE

Third Line - A COUPLE MIDDLE EASTERN GUYS.

They enter the fourth line behind the Asians.

INT. SECURITY, EPPLEY AIRFIELD MOMENTS LATER

Ryan is just fastening his belt, having just gone through

security, when we hear a beeping go off. Natalie is trying to

find the metal on her body that has set off the machine. She also

has forgotten to take her laptop out of her bag. It's a mess.

INT. BOEING 757 - MID FLIGHT

Ryan is sketching a theoretical book cover for "The

Backback". Natalie is working on an Excel Document on her

laptop - She's a loud tapper... Hitting the keys with violent

strokes. It draws Ryan's attention and a raised eyebrow.

Natalie smiles and goes back to her work. Ryan goes to say

something, but holds back for now.

INT. MAIN TERMINAL, ST. LOUIS INT'L AIRPORT - DAY

Ryan zips through the wandering types as Natalie tries to

keep up. Ryan's phone rings. He sees the caller ID. Smiles.

Natalie nods and keeps moving. Ryan picks up.

INT. HOTEL CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Alex is on her cell phone as a junior behind her folds a

portable projector screen.

Ryan turns into an elevator well to talk.

Alex stops. She moves to a quieter place.

Ryan lights up... This woman fucking rocks. Then recovers.

Joy.

INT. ELEVATOR, BOTTLING COMPANY - DAY

Ryan and Natalie ride, briefcases in hand. Natalie is swaying

back and forth. Ryan notices. Is she nervous? Excited?

Ding - The elevator door opens.

INT. RECEPTION, BOTTLING COMPANY - DAY

Ryan and Natalie enter the door to find a reception desk on

an empty floor. Scattered telephones sit on the ground where

desks used to be. A few desks in one corner are still manned.

Natalie tries not to show: It's all becoming very real.

The desk girl looks up from her work. She knows who they are.

INT. CUBICLE CITY, BOTTLING COMPANY - DAY

Ryan and Natalie pass rows of cubicles. Heads begin to pop up

to see their arrival. Natalie accidentally makes eye contact

with one guy, then quickly shifts her gaze forward.

INT. WINDOWLESS CONFERENCE ROOM, BOTTLING COMPANY - DAY

Ryan and Natalie sit next to each other at a polyurethane

conference table.

Ryan points to a stack of packets.

MONTAGE OF MORE REAL PEOPLE REACTING TO BEING FIRED

A SERIES OF REAL PEOPLE sit down across from Ryan and Natalie

REAL PEOPLE tighten up as they begin to catch on.

REAL PEOPLE blame all sorts of people and situations that

they personally hold responsible.

REAL PEOPLE respond further. Some are enraged. Some are

polite. One is even grateful.

Ryan nods to Natalie who we now see begrudgingly HANDING

PACKETS to all of the REAL PEOPLE we've already met.

We SEE the "TREE OF ASPIRATIONS" sheet.

We see more packets getting handed out as Ryan repeats...

BOB (AN ACTOR) PRESENTING A PHOTO OF HIS CHILDREN

BOB. Dry red eyes from tears of rage stare down the lens.

Natalie can't hold back any longer.

Ryan looks at Natalie like she's out of her mind.

Natalie shrinks. Ryan immediately covers.

Bob looks up shocked and pissed.

Natalie looks to Ryan - Where is he going with this?

Ryan picks up Bob's resume.

Bob simply shrugs.

Bob looks up and meets eyes with Ryan.

Bob's eyes begin to water again. He's a changed man.

Ryan shoots Natalie a look - Hand over the packet.

Natalie jumps to attention and hands Bob a packet.

INT. LOBBY, ST. LOUIS HILTON - NIGHT

There's a BUSINESS WOMAN waiting in the regular line. Ryan

walks right past her and gets into the ELITE LINE. They are

now both first in their respective lines for the counter.

The woman looks over at Ryan and sighs. Natalie holds back,

confused by Ryan's actions and wanting to avoid confrontation.

The DESK CLERK frees up and gestures for Ryan to step

forward. Ryan begins wheeling his bag forward. Meanwhile, the

woman lifts her hand in outrage.

Ryan grabs a BROCHURE for ELITE MEMBERSHIP off the desk and

hands it to the business woman.

The woman bats it out of Ryan's hand onto the floor.

Ryan looks back at the desk clerk and smiles. The desk clerk

swipes his card.

Ryan's DIGITAL NUMBER bumps up another thousand points.

INT. PUBLIC BATHROOM, ST. LOUIS HILTON - EVENING

Natalie is washing her hands, when she stops to look at

herself in the mirror.

After a beat, she hears someone CRYING in one of the stalls.

She goes to see if the woman is okay, then stops herself -

Maybe I fired her.

She grabs a paper towel, dries off her hands, and leaves.

INT. RESTAURANT BAR, ST. LOUIS HILTON - EVENING

Natalie sits back down at the table a little visibly shaken.

Just then, their food arrives... And there's a lot of food.

Natalie's eyes move back and forth trying to figure out why

there seems to be three main courses and a bunch of sides.

Ryan gives Natalie a look - Is she ready for this information?

Ryan looks back at Natalie - Hobby?

Ryan can't help but laugh a little.

This idea sinks in for a second with both of them.

INT. RYAN'S ROOM, ST. LOUIS HILTON - NIGHT

Ryan is laying in bed wearing a Hilton bathrobe. He's

reviewing his sister's wedding invite when his BLACKBERRY

BUZZES on the night stand. He reaches over to check it. It's

a text message:

Alex: "Can't fall asleep."

Ryan types back:

Ryan: "Me too. Just laying here."

INT. ALEX'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Alex is in a t-shirt, lying in bed. She types away at her

BLACKBERRY and presses SEND.

Ryan's BLACKBERRY BUZZES again.

Alex: "You should rub one out."

Types back.

Ryan: "Only fair if you do too."

BLACKBERRY BUZZES again.

Alex: "Way ahead of you."

Ryan: "Call me next time so I can listen."

Alex: ";) Have sweet dreams about me."

Ryan smiles. He stares at the message for a second, then sets

the blackberry down and turns off the light.

EXT. LAMBERT FIELD, ST. LOUIS - DAY

Natalie is standing with a camera in her hands, giving

directions.

Reveal: Ryan is placing the CUT-OUT of Julie and Jim.

The camera POV makes it look like Julie and Jim are standing

in front of St. Louis International Airport.

Natalie takes the photo.

Ryan goes to say something, but Natalie is already gone.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, WICHITA SECURITIES COMPANY - DAY

Ryan and Natalie sit stoically as a YOUNG ASIAN GUY rants

about why they are idiots to fire him.

The young asian guy snaps up one of the PACKETS and leaves,

slamming the door behind himself.

Ryan gives it some thought.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, WICHITA SECURITIES COMPANY - LATER

A professional African-American woman wearing a smart suit

sits down at the conference table.

Natalie sits up.

Natalie begins to tremble.

EXT. WICHITA SECURITIES COMPANY COURTYARD - DAY

Natalie bursts out the doors and sits on a bench. She's

freaked out. Ryan is five steps behind her. He puts a hand on

her shoulder.

Natalie is clearly still worried.

A PLANE PULLING BACK ITS GATE AND TAKING OFF

INT. HILTON HOTEL LOBBY - EARLY MORNING

Ryan turns a corner to find Natalie talking to her computer

screen with headphones on.

She's having an iChat with someone, but we only hear her side

of the conversation. Ryan decides to listen in for a second.

Ryan frowns. Checks a mirror.

A NEW OFFICE - MORE EMPLOYEES REACT TO BEING LAID OFF

WE SEE SHOTS OF VARIOUS SLICES OF THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE FROM

THOUSANDS OF FEET IN THE AIR

EXT. MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY

A 757 touches down on the runway.

RYAN'S HEADSHOT - sitting on an EASLE.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, WICHITA HOTEL - AFTERNOON

Ryan stands before a similar crowd as the opening of the film.

A titter through the crowd. For the first time, we see

Natalie near the side, watching.

Light laughter.

Ryan lets the weight sink in.

You can feel the relief in the room.

Noticeable agreement.

Ryan focuses towards his conclusion.

INT. ANNEX, WICHITA HOTEL - AFTERNOON

Ryan has finished his session and is talking to eager

stragglers. Ryan accepts a business card and elaborates on

one of his theories.

Meanwhile, down the hall, Natalie is finishing a phone call.

She looks shell shocked. She closes her phone and pockets it

in silence.

EXT. TARMAC, MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY

AN AMERICAN AIRLINES PLANE touches down.

EXT. MIAMI BOULEVARD - DAY

We're following a HILTON SHUTTLE down a street of PALM TREES.

INT. HILTON AIRPORT SHUTTLE - AFTERNOON

Natalie and Ryan ride back to the airport. We catch them mid-

conversation as Natalie drills Ryan on his theory.

Ryan smiles to the few other riders as if apologizing.

Natalie sighs.

The shuttle stops and everyone goes to grab their bags.

INT. LOBBY, MIAMI HILTON - DAY

Ryan and Natalie enter, still having the same conversation.

Ryan stops to address this.

Ryan turns, thinks of something, then turns back.

Natalie looks steamed.

Out of nowhere, Natalie starts crying.

Natalie is now balling in the middle of the lobby.

Ryan goes to hug Natalie and she simply folds into his arms -

A mop of tears. Ryan looks around for a place to set her

down. Instead, he finds...

ALEX - Who gives a questioning look to the young sobbing girl.

Natalie attempts a recovery. It's not graceful.

Natalie gives Alex a firm handshake.

Ryan goes to challenge the idea, when...

Natalie leads the way. Alex and Ryan exchange quick hellos.

THE SCREEN OF NATALIE'S CELL PHONE

TEXT READS: "I Think it's time we c other people"

INT. BAR LOUNGE - MIAMI HILTON - MOMENTS LATER

The three share a booth. Natalie is sipping a drink. She seems

to have settled a little.

Both Natalie and Alex shoot Ryan a look.

It's alright. None taken.

Natalie catches herself, having no idea how old Alex is.

This catches both Alex and Ryan off guard.

Ryan smiles.

We can tell Ryan is taking a serious interest in this.

Alex looks to Ryan. He has a nice smile.

Alex and Ryan react - It's not that bad.

Natalie looks worse than when the conversation started.

Natalie cracks a smile.

Ryan looks to Alex. They've grown closer.

INT. LOBBY LOUNGE, MIAMI HILTON - DAY

Ryan, Alex, and Natalie wheel their ROLL-AWAYS towards the

elevator.

Ryan and Alex share an uncomfortable silence.

Natalie notices a group of SOFTWARE TYPES mingling with

badges around their necks.

I mean, I don't know if... More money than they know

These guy put on a quite a what to do with...

party...

INT. CONFERENCE CORRIDOR, MIAMI HILTON - NIGHT

Ryan, Alex, and Natalie confidently walk up to the CHECK-IN

TABLE and take BADGES.

They turn the corner. Alex reads Natalie's badge.

INT. SOFTWARE CONVENTION PARTY, MIAMI HILTON - NIGHT

Corporate color balloons. Lots of guys in LOGO POLOS. That

great hip hop song from 1998 is playing over the PA.

We find Ryan, Alex, and Natalie at a stand up table. They're now

wearing badges. Natalie is pretty tipsy at this point.

A CONFERENCE LEADER steps up to an on stage MIC.

People cheer. So do Ryan, Alex, and particularly Natalie.

The opening beats of the 90's jam "Bust-A-Move" blast over

the speakers and sure enough, now-40-year-old rapper, Young

MC steps out and starts rapping.

Everyone goes crazy and starts dancing.

Ryan and Alex make it out to the dance floor. They're awful

dancers, but they're having fun.

Natalie has already found a dancing partner, who can't

believe his luck. She's all over him. Ryan smiles.

EXT. BOAT - NIGHT

A nice two story yacht that was obviously purchased before

the bubble popped. Inside the galley, a group is playing

karaoke. NATALIE, wearing BADGES like Mardi Gras beads, is

singing "Time After Time".

Meanwhile, near the back, Ryan and Alex sit with their legs

hanging off the back of the hull.

Ryan emotionally stumbles.

It's what us modern girls do when

we have a crush.

Did it bother you?

Well, that depends. Is the bag

empty because you hate people or

just the baggage they bring along?

I don't hate people. I'm not

exactly a hermit.

You just don't want to be tied down?

The whole responsibility thing.

I don't think it's even that...

I... First time I ever flew, I was

sixteen.

You're not going to answer? You're

just going to tell me a story?

It was January and I had just

gotten my driver's license. The

lakes were frozen over, so we piled

into my car and hit the ice to do

donuts. When, out of nowhere, I hit

a soft spot and the hood of my car

tilted up and I was sinking

backwards into the water.

Jesus...

I literally started to drown.

Within a few seconds, I black out.

Then, I wake up in the sky. I'm in a

helicopter, laying on a stretcher.

This guy in a uniform is telling me I

was minutes away from dying.

Oh my God.

The idea settles in. Ryan returns to the point.

And now they kiss. It's notably different from their previous

kisses. Now, when they lock lips, we are reminded why people

kiss in the first place.

Then, all of a sudden, the lights go out on the boat. The

motor has stopped. Ryan and Alex look back to find the

software dude stepping out of the galley, drunk.

Ryan and Alex look out to shore... about 500 yards away. For

whatever reason, they just start cracking up.

EXT. PONTOON BOAT - NIGHT

Ryan and Alex are huddled under a blanket in the corner of

the rubber boat as it putters its way to shore.

Cold, soaked, and smiling.

Natalie and David are there too... still kissing.

EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

Everyone gets out of the boat in the cold knee deep water and

splashes up to shore.

INT. LOBBY, MIAMI HILTON - NIGHT

Ryan and Alex followed by Natalie and her make-out buddy,

soaked from the knee down, holding their shoes, scamper into

the hotel on the balls of their feet.

INT. RYAN'S HOTEL ROOM, MIAMI HILTON - NEXT MORNING

Ryan's eyes flutter awake to see Alex getting dressed.

Alex gives him a peck. Ryan takes her wrist so she can't leave.

They kiss again and he lets go. Alex leaves and the door

closes. Ryan just lays in bed for a moment.

INT. CAFE - MIAMI HILTON - MORNING

Ryan and Natalie have a quiet breakfast. Natalie looks pretty

worse for wear.

In the background is a TRAVELING SALESMAN rolling calls. He

perks up for each message then goes back to being miserable.

Meanwhile, after a little silent eating...

This doesn't comfort her.

EXT. OCEAN BOARDWALK, MIAMI - DAY

The walkway overlooks a large MARINA filled with giant

YACHTS. Ryan and Natalie are doing the photo thing with the

CUT OUT of the engagement portrait again.

What happened to Alex?

Had to skip town early to make a

meeting.

That's too bad. Where does she live?

Chicago.

You thinking of going to see her?

I don't know. We just don't have

that kind of relationship.

What kind of relationship do you

have?

It's, you know. Casual.

Sounds pretty special.

It works for us.

Think there's any future there?

Never thought about it. What's

going on here?

Really never thought about it?

No.

How can you not think about these

things? How does it not even cross

your mind that you might want to

have a future with somebody?

Natalie knocks over the CUT OUT and stands up.

Natalie begins walking away.

A GUST OF WIND suddenly blows the CUTOUT across the boardwalk

into the OCEAN.

Ryan goes running after the cutout. He climbs down a GANGWAY

to a dock that is closest to the CUTOUT, which is beginning

to sink in the filthy water.

Ryan reaches... and reaches... and just as he's got a finger

tip on the photo... FALLS IN.

INT. BATHROOM, MIAMI HILTON - DAY

Ryan, still damp from the ocean, is drying the CUTOUT with a

hair dryer.

INT. CONCOURSE, MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY

We're following the CUTOUT HEADS popping out of the ROLL-AWAY

like earlier, only now they are slightly faded and bent from

their trip in the harbor.

EXT. TARMAC, MIAMI INTERNATIONAL - DAY

We're watching Ryan through the window of the plane. He

almost looks trapped.

EXT. TARMAC, DETROIT INTERATIONAL - DAY

The plane lands amidst snow.

INT. RENTAL CAR, DETROIT HIGHWAY - DAY

Ryan and Natalie drive in silence. The weather is frigid.

EXT. DETROIT CAR PART COMPANY - DAY

A one story brick building. There's an inch of snow on the

ground. Ryan and Natalie enter the building in silence.

INT. DETROIT COMPANY - DAY

Ryan and Natalie check in at the front desk.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, DETROIT COMPANY - DAY

The door opens. Ryan and Natalie enter, when they both see

something and immediately stop short.

Sitting on the conference table is a COMPUTER set up for a

VIDEO CONFERENCE.

Framed up in a WINDOW on the screen is CRAIG GREGORY.

Natalie and Ryan exchange a look.

Ryan sighs.

Natalie, once confident, now takes pause.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, DETROIT COMPANY - MOMENTS LATER

Ryan and Natalie have a moment aside.

INT. CRAIG GREGORY'S OFFICE, CTC - LATER

Craig is leaning back in his office chair, watching Natalie

on his monitor.

INT. ALTERNATE CONFERENCE ROOM, DETROIT COMPANY - DAY

An unsuspecting man in his mid fifties enters the room and

takes a seat at a COMPUTER TERMINAL.

(for the remainder of the scene, we will intercut between

Natalie's room and the POV of the man's iChat session.)

Ryan fights the urge to jump in. He is sitting next to

Natalie, but just out of view of the camera.

Mr. Samuels is now on the verge of tears. Eyes red.

We remain in the room with Natalie and Ryan, but we hear Mr.

Samuels crying. It's loud and embarrassing. It's coming from

the next room. He's literally on the other side of the wall.

Samuels picks up the packet and opens it.

Samuels begins to leaf through.

Samuels puts down the packet. The tears still coming slowly.

Samuels doesn't move. He's just sitting there in a daze.

No reaction. Just more silent tears. Natalie is getting nervous.

Ryan fights the urge to break in as Natalie continues to lose

her composure.

Craig leans into his computer, watching intently.

Finally, Samuels breaks from his daze. He looks up and around

for a second, then gets up and leaves.

Natalie catches her breath. A second later, Samuels passes

their room, visible through the conference room windows. They

watch as he walks away.

Natalie nods.

Natalie pulls out a LIST OF FORTY NAMES. The amount of people

is daunting. She crosses off the first name.

EXT. PARKING LOT, DETROIT CAR PART COMPANY - AFTERNOON

We find Natalie standing next to the rental car. She's staring

into a snow drift. Her eyes say everything - She just grew up.

Meanwhile, Ryan is on his CELL. We catch the end of his

conversation with Craig.

Ryan hangs up.

A moment of mixed emotions.

INT. RYAN'S ROOM, DETROIT HILTON - NIGHT

Ryan is holding the LARGE EMBOSSED ENVELOPE of his sister's

WEDDING INVITATION.

He pulls out the RESPONSE CARD, looks at the line for extra

guests, then sets it down. He pulls out the actual

INVITATION. It looks inexpensive. Sighs.

INT. NORTH TERMINAL, DETROIT AIRPORT - MORNING

Ryan and Natalie ride the MOVING WALKWAY. Something is on

Natalie's mind. She speaks up.

They get off the moving walkway and stop at a GATE that reads

"Omaha". Something off screen grabs Ryan's attention.

Ryan begins to walk off. Pulls out his BLACKBERRY and dials.

Ryan disappears in the crowd.

EXT. PARKING LOT, LAS VEGAS - DAY

We're looking at the LUXOR PYRAMID.

ALEX enters frame, carrying the engagement CUT OUT.

Alex obliges. She checks out the engagement photo.

Ryan takes the photo.

Alex picks up the engagement photo.

Alex and Ryan look at the photo together for a second.

This quickly registers... He's inviting me to the wedding.

A long thoughtful beat. Alex sighs.

They do.

INT. BAGGAGE CAROUSEL, MILWAUKEE AIRPORT - DAY

Two ROLL-AWAYS side-by-side, moving through the terminal.

Ryan and Alex walk in unison. They share a smile. Almost like

they can't believe they're getting away with something.

They pass a LARGE AIRLINE ADVERTISEMENT featuring MAYNARD

FINCH in uniform. "We Value Your Loyalty."

EXT. DRIVEWAY, CHALET SUITES - DAY

Ryan's rental car pulls into the CHALET SUITES driveway. It's

halfway between a Swiss Lodge and a Best Western. Just a

little sadder. A yellow sign reads "Welcome Miller-Bingham

Wedding Guests!"

INT. LOBBY, CHALET SUITES HOTEL - DAY

Ryan and Alex approach the check-in lines. Of course, there's

an elite membership line, but they can't use it.

Ryan is forced to stand in a queue of three people while a

CHECK-IN LADY just stands at her computer at the elite line.

Ryan steams.

INT. CORRIDOR, CHALET SUITES - DAY

Ryan and Alex walk down the long hallway. They've been given

a room at the end. Just as they're entering their room, the

door across the hall opens revealing a woman in her early

forties with a basket of laundry. It's Ryan's sister KARA.

Ryan turns and stops. It's been a while...

They hug. It's a strange hug. Awkward but heartfelt.

Ryan and Alex fumble over each other.

An awkward beat in the corridor of the Chalet Suites.

Kara humps the laundry basket down the hall.

INT. HOTEL ROOM, CHALET SUITES - DAY

Ryan and Alex settle in. There's a cheap basket with a pink

ribbon tied sloppily around some cellophane. In the basket is

a packet, outlining the wedding weekend.

Ryan is kidding, but not really. They play it off as a joke,

but can't help feel the weight of this "moment".

INT. CLUB ROOM FIRESIDE LOUNGE, CHALET SUITES - EVENING

A group of tables have been slid together for the rehearsal

dinner. Ryan and Alex find the dinner in full swing.

Ryan's sister JULIE, the bride, waves wildly.

She hops up and gives him a hug.

Tammy waves.

Julie shows off her ring. It's not quite balanced and seems

to favor quantity over quality.

JIM raises a hand. This is Julie's husband-to-be and we can

tell immediately that Ryan isn't thrilled.

Ryan thinks of something. He pulls out the 5X7 PHOTOS they

took of the JIM & JULIE CUT OUT.

Julie points to a table and Ryan walks over. When he gets there,

we see almost a hundred photos pinned to a map of America. It's

overwhelming. All of a sudden, his effort seems miniscule.

Ryan begins to pin his photos on the map over the cities

where they were taken. He backs away to see it as a whole and

his addition has already become invisible.

Ryan returns to the conversation with his sister and Alex.

The idea of this lands on Ryan pretty hard.

AN HOUR LATER

Ryan is stuck with Jim, talking real estate. Alex is having a

chat with the brides maids about local relationship drama.

Jim makes an exhale noise that means "you bet your ass".

Ryan and Alex make eye contact. There's a joy in their

connection amongst the ramblings of their company.

The conversation stalls out.

EXT. DRIVEWAY, CHALET SUITES - NIGHT

Everyone is leaving. Tammy grabs Julie's hands.

Jim comes walking by with a box of flower arrangements from

the tables inside that are going to be reused at the wedding.

Alex steps back in and for the first time in who knows how

many years, Ryan, Kara, and Julie are alone together.

There's a moment where they just look at each other and

giggle a little. Just the three of them.

Alex comes out with the second box. Ryan notices and grabs the

flowers from her and sets them in Jim's luxury pick-up truck.

INT. CORRIDOR, CHALET SUITES - NIGHT

Ryan, Alex, and Kara arrive at their adjacent rooms. Key

cards slide in simultaneously. Alex heads in. Ryan stops.

EXT. RYAN'S OLD HIGH SCHOOL - NEXT MORNING

The rental car pulls up into the empty lot. Snow on the

ground. It's cold.

Ryan and Alex walk up the steps and try the door of the main

building - it's locked. Ryan shrugs.

Alex starts walking down the side of the building, looking

for an open window. The third one opens a crack. She slides

her HOTEL HONORS CARD in and opens the latch.

INT. CLASSROOM, WAUPACA HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

Alex slowly wedges herself headfirst through the window. Ryan

climbs in after her. He immediately recognizes his

surroundings.

They head for the door.

A TEAM PHOTO OF A HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL TEAM

A finger reaches and points to a teenage face.

INT. HALLWAY, WAUPACA HIGH SCHOOL - NEXT MORNING

Ryan and Alex are huddled at the trophy case.

EXT. LOADING DOCK, WAUPACA HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

Ryan and Alex walk passed a concrete ledge.

INT. STAIRWELL, WAUPACA HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

Ryan shows an area behind the stairwell.

RYAN AND ALEX KISSING UNDER THE STAIRWELL

EXT. SOCCER FIELD, WAUPACA HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

Alex and Ryan sit tight like teenagers on the team bench.

The school soccer team takes the field for practice.

Players look back at him strangely.

Ryan's phone rings.

The first thing we hear is crying in the background.

INT. CHURCH - DAY

Kara is on her cell phone. Behind her in the deep background,

we see bridesmaids consoling Julie.

EXT. CHURCH - DAY

Ryan's rental car pulls up in front. He hops out and Alex

takes the driver's seat.

INT. ENTRY, CHURCH - DAY

Ryan immediately spots Julie sobbing and being consoled by

her bride's maids. The groomsmen are huddled in another

corner, embarrassed and confused. Kara splits from the brides

maids and takes Ryan aside.

A beat.

A beat of stalemate.

Ryan takes a breath.

INT. SUNDAY SCHOOL ROOM, CHURCH - DAY

Ryan quietly steps in to find Jim, half dressed in a tux

reading the children's book "The Velveteen Rabbit". Jim

sniffles. Ryan goes to leave, when...

Jim puts down the book.

Ryan gulps. Fuck.

Ryan takes a beat.

KARA EAVESDROPPING AT THE DOOR WITH A LOOK OF COLD FEAR

Jim sinks a little.

Jim nods.

Jim chuckles to himself.

This resonates with Jim and he can't help but smile.

INT. ENTRY, CHURCH

Jim walks over to the huddle of bride's maids. They part and

let him in. He kneels at Julie's feet...

Julie gives him a perplexed look before smiling and falling

into his arms. Tears and smiles spread amongst the girls.

Kara walks over to Ryan and pats him on the shoulder.

MONTAGE BEGINS AS A SERIES OF IMAGES:

- Ryan and Alex getting dressed in a little kitchen in the

church. They're in a hurry and a little sloppy, but there's a

crooked joy in their faces.

- Jim standing at the alter with the priest getting a pat on

the back from his best man.

- Julie getting walked to the alter by Jim's uncle. They pass

Ryan, who looks on proudly.

- The priest gives his blessings.

- Jim raises Julie's veil. They kiss.

- Wedding attendees file into the Chalet Suites Banquet Hall.

- Ryan and Alex mingle with their table.

- Ryan and Alex dance like teenagers.

- The band does a cheesy choreographed dance step.

- Jim makes a speech. He is not good at public speaking, but

the guests are generous with laughter.

- Tammy has her tongue down a groomsmen's throat.

- Ryan pulls Kara onto the dance floor. She rests her head on

his shoulder and they slow dance.

- Jim and Julie make their farewell and run off.

- Ryan and Alex help pick the center pieces off the tables.

- Ryan and Alex get into the elevator together. She's wearing

his jacket. We're about to see them kiss, when the elevator

door closes.

INT. CONCOURSE, MILWAUKEE AIRPORT - MORNING

Ryan and Alex stand between their gates. One sign reads

OMAHA. The other sign reads CHICAGO.

We hear a boarding announcement for Chicago. Alex begins to

step away to her gate.

A beat. And then...

Alex turns for her gate and joins the crowd. Ryan goes to say

something. He has an impulse... but he finally ignores it and

gets in line under the sign that reads "OMAHA".

INT. RYAN'S APARTMENT, OMAHA - EARLY EVENING

The door opens and Ryan wheels in his Roll-Away. He walks over

to the window, parts the blinds and checks out his awful view.

We see Ryan opening some mail. We see Ryan laying in bed.

It's quiet. It's alone.

INT. CTC HEADQUARTERS, CTC - DAY

Natalie is giving Ryan a tour of the new ONLINE FIRING AREA -

A series of cubicles with YOUNG GUYS ON HEADSETS. She is in

her element and very proud of her work.

Ryan can only watch.

INT. RYAN'S OFFICE, CTC - DAY

Ryan is sitting at his desk. He puts on a HEADSET.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, CTC - ANOTHER DAY

Craig is leading a meeting. Ryan seems focused on something

on his laptop. We see his screen: An itinerary for GoalQuest.

EXT. LAS VEGAS STRIP - DAY

One of the GIANT DIGITAL MARQUEES reads: "GOALQUEST XX"

INT. GREEN ROOM, GOALQUEST - DAY

Ryan sits on a sofa, holding his BACKPACK. A slick GOALQUEST

HOST enters the room.

Ryan nods and gets up.

INT. CONVENTION HALL, LAS VEGAS - DAY

Ryan stands in the wings. He takes a breath, then steps out

in front of a sea of people.

The GOALQUEST XX stage is like nothing we've seen yet. Large

and professional. Blue Banners hang from the ceiling. Digital

projectors show Ryan's Headshot - What's In Your Backpack?

Ryan sets the BACK PACK on a table and quickly unzips it.

A breath.

A long beat. Uncomfortable. Ryan looks at the back pack.

Ryan isn't feeling them. He is not inspired. He isn't

believable. He's barely even there.

Ryan is trying, but he can't find the will to do this.

Ryan takes a beat. He just stares at the backpack and thinks

about all the things he has removed from it... And then...

And with that, Ryan leaves the stage. Handlers try to figure

out what Ryan is doing. The Host runs for the mic.

EXT. CONCOURSE, MCCARRAN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY

Ryan hustles past SLOT MACHINES until he is actually jogging.

INT. BOARDING GATE, MCCARRAN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY

Ryan runs up to a gate. He's the last one to board.

INT. BOEING 757 - NIGHT

Over Ryan's shoulder, through the window, we see Chicago

below as the flight begins its descent.

INT. CORRIDOR OF LIGHT, CHICAGO O'HARE AIRPORT - NIGHT

Ryan on the PEOPLE MOVER under the ceiling of NEON LIGHTS.

Peaceful music emits from hidden speakers. Ryan walks briskly

past idle riders.

EXT. RENTAL CAR SATELLITE KIOSK, CHICAGO - NIGHT

Ryan hurriedly signs a hand-held device, hops into a SEDAN

and speeds off. The RENTAL CAR ASSISTANT suddenly realizes...

EXT. TOWNHOUSE, CHICAGO SUBURBS - NIGHT

Ryan steps out of his rental car and approaches the door of

the townhouse - checking the address against a piece of

HILTON STATIONARY.

Ryan stops, knocks, and puts on a smile.

We hear Footsteps. The door unlocks and opens revealing ALEX.

She's wearing sweatpants and glasses. She's at home. She

looks different.

But there's something else. Alex is in shock... She's frozen.

Something's wrong. Ryan's smile begins to melt.

A man's voice calls from inside.

A couple kids run by through the background, giggling. A man

chases after them.

Alex is still speechless. Her eyes are angry and apologizing

all at the same time.

Ryan just stands there. Emotionally bleeding to death.

Ryan begins to step away. He turns and heads for his car,

dropping the flowers.

Alex's husband becomes visible just as she's shutting the door.

Ryan gets in his rental car and drives off.

EXT. CHICAGO HILTON - NIGHT

We're watching Ryan through his window from far away... almost

as if looking through binoculars. He sits on his bed, tie

undone, holding a glass with an inch of scotch on his knee.

INT. RYAN'S SUITE, CHICAGO HILTON - MORNING

We see quick glimpses of Ryan getting ready. Crappy little

COFFEE MAKER crappily brewing. Crappy hotel BAR OF SOAP

crappily lathering. Crappy HAIR DRYER crappily blowing.

EXT. AIR TRAIN, CHICAGO O'HARE AIRPORT - MORNING

Ryan is on the phone with Alex.

INT. ALEX'S CAR, DOWNTOWN GARAGE - SAME

Alex sits in the car with the engine running.

Ryan stumbles on this. What does he want?

Ryan can't quite believe what he's hearing. There's only one

thing he can do. He hangs up.

EXT. ESCALATOR, CHICAGO O'HARE AIRPORT - MORNING

Ryan is walking when his phone buzzes. He checks the DISPLAY -

CTC Calling. He presses IGNORE.

INT. TICKET DESK - CHICAGO O'HAIRE - DAY

Ryan walks up to the TICKET DESK. He is more lost than usual.

There is something plucky about the TICKET AGENT.

The plucky agent fades a bit, then tries to recompose.

Ryan takes the ticket and exits.

INT. BOEING 757 - DAY

Ryan sits doing nothing. Others around him play Sudoku, read

trashy paperbacks, work on laptops. Ryan just stairs at the

stitching on the seat in front of him. When... "Bing"

Passengers look up.

The Gershwin theme song for the airline rains down from the

overhead speakers. Passengers clap. Flight attendants gather

at Ryan's seat with big smiles and champagne.

Ryan doesn't even react. He's just stunned.

The flight attendants separate just enough for a man in a

bomber jacket to squeeze through. It's Maynard Finch, the

Chief Pilot from the commercial.

Maynard gives a little salute to his flight attendants, then

slides by Ryan to the window seat.

Maynard pulls out a MEMBERSHIP CARD. It's actually been

stamped from platinum.

It has a pair of wings around "Member Number 7". Ryan holds

it between his fingertips... Catches his own reflection.

A long beat.

Ryan looks at him straight in the face.

INT. RYAN'S OFFICE, CTC - NEXT DAY

Ryan picks up the phone at his desk. He removes his new TEN

MILLION MILE CARD and dials a number off the back.

Craig enters Ryan's doorway.

Craig takes a seat across from Ryan.

An uncomfortable beat.

Ryan doesn't.

Ryan remembers her.

Ryan isn't surprised.

Ryan stifles a laugh.

Ryan doesn't react.

Ryan absorbs this. Nods.

INT. OFFICE, SAN FRANCISCO - DAY

A MANAGEMENT LEVEL GUY sits at his desk. Bay Area sports

paraphernalia on the wall.

We turn to reveal Natalie.

The manager smiles to himself.

The manager raises a letter - It's Ryan's letter.

INT. RYAN'S OFFICE, CTC - DAY

Ryan writing the letter. We hear what he's writing...

INT. OFFICE, SAN FRANCISCO - DAY

The manager puts down the letter and reaches out a hand.

Natalie breaks into a smile, then jumps back to professional.

INT. CORRIDOR, RYAN'S LOFT - DAY

Ryan steps out his front door, ROLL-AWAY in tow.

INT. OMAHA AIRPORT - DAY

Ryan walks through the automated door. He looks like he did

in the opening of the film. Maybe even wearing the same

clothes. Something is different though.

Ryan stops and looks up at a GIANT BOARD OF DESTINATIONS. An

endless list of cities around the world. A menu of new lives

departing every five minutes.

We look back at Ryan. His eyes lock on one of the cities. We

don't see which one. He makes a mental decision and turns in

the direction of the gate. He lets go of his ROLL-AWAY.

Ryan takes a step, but before his foot can land we...
