INT. TOLL BOOTH - DAWN

A LONE TOLL BOOTH ATTENDANT sits inside his glass box on

an empty stretch of interstate.

This is HENRY.

He looks out at the horizon. It's starting to get light

out. There's snow on the ground.

He's neither asleep nor awake.

INT. TOLL BOOTH - MOMENTS LATER

HENRY'S PLASTIC GLOVES unscrew a THERMOS, pour coffee

into a Styrofoam cup. There are only a few drops left.

Approaches. Henry straightens, slides open his window.

But the CAR veers over to the automated EZ-PASS LANE...

Henry closes the window, watches the car disappear. He

downs the last of his coffee, looks back out at the

horizon again.

It's cloudy out there.

flips to 6:00.

INT. TOLL BOOTH - LATER

Henry packs up his thermos, puts on his coat and steps

out into the icy morning.

He walks toward his truck. The traffic is beginning to

build.

EXT. BUFFALO STREET - MORNING

Henry's old FORD PICK-UP drives past the enormous,

abandoned CENTRAL TRAIN TERMINAL.

EXT. BUFFALO STREET - MORNING

The pick-up turns down toward a neighborhood of modest

salt-box houses.

EXT. HENRY'S HOUSE - MORNING

Henry's truck rolls into his driveway.

INT. HENRY'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Henry enters. Hangs up his down jacket on a row of hooks.

It's clean and ordinary in here.

His wife, DEBBIE, is in the kitchen. She's wearing a

NURSES uniform. Henry notices the dining room table set

for one for breakfast. Eggs, bacon, sausage. He's a

little surprised. Debbie appears. Lays down the toast.

He sits. She smiles. Starts buttering the toast.

He digs in.

She's still buttering the toast. Carefully.

She sets it down.

She sits down next to him. Watches him eat.

She nods.

He takes another bite.

Pause.

Pause.

She just stares at him...

Pause.

Henry stops eating.

Pause.

He looks down, resumes eating. A beat.

He looks up again.

He's still as a stone.

She looks at him.

A very long pause. Henry doesn't do anything now.

She's crestfallen.

He just sits.

THE FRONT DOORBELL RINGS

Henry gets up, heads to the door.

Debbie watches him go...

EXT. HENRY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Outside on the step there are TWO MEN in SOFTBALL

UNIFORMS. One of them is puking. Behind them TWO more

GUYS sit in the back of the car.

Henry recognizes the smiling, pock-marked face of EDDIE

VIBES. Two parts charm, one part menace. His puking

friend is JOE.

Eddie glances up and down the street.

INT. HENRY'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Eddie and Henry watch while Debbie attends to the sick

JOE, bits of puke still clinging to his softball uniform.

She touches his forehead.

He starts to retch.

Eddie glances at Henry as Debbie leads him expertly

toward the bathroom.

Eddie stares at him. Smiles.

Beat.

Henry looks around the room. For a moment he watches

Debbie with Joe in the bathroom, the door half open.

She's tending to him, caring for him...

Debbie looks up. Sees Henry staring at her.

INT. IMPALA - LATER

Henry drives. He wears Joe's too small softball uniform.

Eddie rides shotgun, the other two in the back. They

grimly stare out the windows.

EXT. MAIN ST - DAY

The car turns a corner on to Main Street.

The car pulls up to a row of stores including the FIRST

BUFFALO BANK.

Eddie pats Henry's shoulder.

Eddie and the guys get out. Henry notes this is strange.

After a moment Henry realizes something stinks. He sniffs

his sleeve.

In the rearview, Henry doesn't notice Eddie and the two

guys slipping on SKI MASKS...

A PET STORE OWNER rolls up the security gates of his

store and enters. He says good morning to all the

animals. It's a strange one man show.

LOUD ALARMS BLARE --

Henry startles, looks back to where the sound's coming

THREE GUYS IN SKI MASKS

Fly out of the bank on the corner and scatter in various

directions. They're all wearing softball uniforms. A BANK

GUARD chases them.

ON HENRY, confused.

A second bank guard FRANK (50s, African-American) is

crossing the street toward the bank with two coffees. He

sees what's going on, drops the coffees, and pulls his gun :

Henry turns forward again.

Is pointing at him through the windshield.

Henry slowly raises his hands off the wheel.

Frank sucks his teeth, his gun trained on Henry as the

distant sound of BLARING SIRENS grows louder.

Holding on Henry's stunned expression...

INT. POLICE STATION, INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

Henry sits at a small table as a DETECTIVE, whose face we

never see, paces back and forth.

Henry just listens.

Henry's still silent.

Henry looks up at him, making eye contact for the first

time.

INT. BUFFALO COURTROOM - DAY

Henry stands in a suit, flanked by his state-appointed

ATTORNEY. Debbie sits in the gallery.

A JUDGE stares at Henry.

WHACK!

The gavel goes down.

Henry blinks. He looks at his lawyer who is pleased with

the sentence. He pats Henry, well done.

Henry looks back at Debbie. She's just staring at him...

CLANK!

A CELL DOOR is SLAMMED SHUT...

INT. PRISON CELL - DAY

Henry, wearing a prison jumpsuit, watches as the guard

locks the door in front of him.

Henry turns.

A beat.

MAX (60s) pulls up his pants, flushes the TOILET.

Henry just watches.

Max smiles. Goes to the sink. Washes his hands.

He dries his hands. Presents one of them to Henry.

Henry sits down on his bed.

A beat. It's starting to hit Henry...

INT. PRISON CELL - MORNING

All the cell doors SLAM open. Henry startles awake. Max

is already dressed.

Henry's disoriented.

A GUARD, seeing Henry still in his bunk, bangs his baton

against the bars of the cell.

INT. DINING ROOM - DAY

Max and Henry move along a line of convicts waiting for

their food.

Henry's lost in thought...

Henry puts out his tray.

A bald, TATTOOED GANG-BANGER walks right past them to a table.

Henry nods.

Henry does.

INT. DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Max and Henry sit down at one of the long tables.

They begin to eat.

Henry thinks about that. Puts a piece of potato in his mouth.

EXT. YARD - DAY

Max and Henry walk through the crowded prison yard.

Max takes his arm :

Henry looks at him.

Max shoots a look back at him.

Max suddenly glimpses some activity over Henry's shoulder.

Several convicts are making their way towards them...

He pulls Henry close, his tone suddenly intense :

CRAACK!

Henry's punched in the side of the head. The inmates grab

him, throw him to the ground next to Max.

Henry gets up : CHARGES the inmates, arms swinging,

taking several down. He gives it everything he's got.

They pile into him, pummeling him. Henry just keeps

fighting...but it's hopeless.

GUARDS rush in. Max watches.

INT. MAX AND HENRY'S CELL - NIGHT

Henry lies on his bunk, his face battered and bruised.

Henry touches his swollen eye. It stings.

INT. PRISON TIER - NIGHT

One by one we see lights blinking off across the vast

string of cells.

INT. VISITING AREA - DAY

Henry's wife Debbie sits at one of the metal visiting

tables. She's dressed up. She's really made an effort.

A door opens, Henry appears. He looks different. Some

time has passed. He smiles, walks over. Then sits.

A beat.

Henry takes that in.

Pause.

Pause.

He thinks.

He looks at her.

No one moves.

EXT. PRISON YARD - LATER THAT DAY

Henry sits on a bench alone, processing what just

happened. He looks up at the sky. Gray and empty.

Max arrives, sits down next to Henry, carefully puts a

hand around his shoulder.

Henry turns to him.

Henry thinks.

TWO YEARS LATER

INT. MAX AND HENRY'S CELL - DAY

There's music on a radio. Pull back to reveal Henry

sitting on his bunk. He's grown a beard.

Their cell has temporarily been converted into a

makeshift BARBERSHOP.

CONVICTS of various races wait to get their hair cut by

Max the Barber.

Max holds up a mirror to his customer, FINK.

Henry checks the schedule by his side, calls out a name.

Standing just outside, A GUARD watches the make-shift

barbershop carefully.

Hector takes his seat. Max wraps a sheet around his neck.

The other INMATES egg him on.

Max finally puts his clippers down.

Max's face starts to shudder...his shoulders jerking back

a little bit...

Eyes ablaze and face beetroot red and twitching like a

mad man...

The inmates look slightly scared. Max casually picks up

his clippers and smiles :

They crack up. A beat.

Laughter.

Everyone laughs.

Everyone laughs again.

Henry ponders.

INT. SHOWERS - DAY

INMATES shower. Alot of noise and steam. Henry and Max at

the end of a row.

Max thinks, lathering his hair...

INT. MAX AND HENRY'S CELL - MORNING

It's early morning. Henry's clean shaven, dressed in

street clothes. He packs the last of his things into a

sports bag, zips it up.

Looks over at Max whose eyes are closed. Max looks

vulnerable, like a child, the coverlet pulled right up to

his neck.

Henry, silent for a moment.

The cell door slides open.

Henry starts to leave.

Pause.

Henry continues...stops at the door.

Henry smiles.

EXT. PRISON - DAY

It's cloudy. Henry walks through the front GATE of the

prison. He takes a long deep breath of free air. It's

cold. We see his exhale.

He starts to walk.

INT. GREYHOUND BUS - DAY

Henry sits in the back of the bus, the New York

countryside streaking past him in a blur...

EXT. BUFFALO STREET - DAY

Henry turns onto his old street.

EXT. HENRY'S HOUSE - DAY

Henry walks up to his doorway. He hesitates before

ringing the bell. A beat.

The door opens. It's --

The guy who got sick several years before. He's wearing a

suit and tie now.

INT. HENRY'S OLD HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Henry enters. His old house looks more or less the same.

Joe heads over to small display of KITCHENWARE SAMPLES in

the living room.

As Joe clips several FLOW CHARTS onto an easel -- they

look like they were done by a kid -- Debbie appears with

a Bud Lite. She hands it to Henry. She smiles.

It's not so awkward.

INT. GARAGE - MINUTES LATER

Debbie leads Henry to a NAVY BAG and a BOX with Henry's

name on it.

A beat. They just stand there for a moment.

He means it.

Henry picks up the box, shoulders the bag.

Joe enters.

Joe grabs a DISPLAY STAND featuring kitchen products.

They all head out of the garage.

Passing through the living room arriving GUESTS notice

Henry walking out carrying his box.

Henry nods, starts to head out.

A beat.

A beat.

He leaves.

EXT. STREET NEAR HENRY'S OLD HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Henry walks down the street with his box.

A NEIGHBOR approaches, recognizes him.

Henry looks over.

A beat.

INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

A shitty apartment. Tiny. A bed. A desk.

The TV is on low.

Henry sits on a chair by the bed, the box between his

legs, its contents spread out over the bed.

Photographs of a long-forgotten vacation in Puerto Rico

with Debbie. A Baseball glove.

A high-school year book. Inside, a page of senior photos.

He finds his own picture smiling at the thresh-hold of

adulthood. Underneath his name it reads : "MOST NICEST

He studies the image a moment, flips to the inner cover,

graffitied with hand-written messages from classmates

including : "Henry don't be such a fag, Eddie Vibes"

Henry puts the yearbook back in the box. Next to it are a

pile of photographs spread out...images from Henry's

childhood...of him and Debbie...of different times. He

finishes putting everything back.

A distinctive JINGLE! on the TV. Henry looks over.

An ad for the local Buffalo lottery, a PRETTY YOUNG

BLONDE in a sequinned dress speaks to the camera.

Henry closes the lid of the box, regards it.

INT. PAROLE OFFICE, BUFFALO - DAY

Henry sits at a desk. He's handed a cup of coffee by his

FEMALE PAROLE OFFICER -- whose face we never actually

see.

Henry takes a sip.

EXT. FIELD - DAY

A grass field. It's raining.

Henry steps into frame with a SHOVEL. Behind him an OLDER

MAN in a cap pushes a wheelbarrow.

IN THE DITCH - LATER

From a low-angle we watch as Henry digs. He's a few feet

down. The wheelbarrowman still watches silently.

INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

Henry lies on his bed, staring up at the ceiling. His

mind turns. He's starting to think...O.S. the sound of

the `BuffaLotto' jingle on the TV.

EXT. DITCH - DAY

It's snowing. The Wheelbarrowman watches silently as

Henry digs another small ditch.

INT. BUFFALO SIX MOVIE THEATRE - NIGHT

Henry sits in the back row. We watch him as he eats

popcorn. The movie flashes across his face. There are

guns involved...

EXT. FIELD - DUSK

A cloudy spring day. Henry climbs out of the ditch.

Throws down his shovel and shakes the wheelbarrowman's

hand.

He walks away past ROWS OF GRAVES. He notices a flower

poking through the dirt.

INT. PAROLE OFFICE - DAY

The female PAROLE OFFICER sets down a cup of coffee.

Henry drinks. We still don't see her face.

She sits down at her desk.

Henry takes a breath.

She signs a document and hands it to him.

Henry doesn't answer.

The SOUND of boots, move in on HENRY'S EXPRESSION,

staring, as we

HENRY'S DIRTY BOOTS march along the street with

purpose...

We follow them.

After a while, the boots stop.

EXT. MAIN ST. BUFFALO - DAY

HENRY looks up : we travel around him, see what he sees :

THE FIRST BUFFALO BANK

Directly across the street. Holding on Henry as he

contemplates the place...

Henry takes a deep breath. Focuses in.

There's something happening, he's not sure what it

is...an idea perhaps, an instinct that somehow with each

passing moment becomes more like a knowing....

A moment of revelation.

He starts across the street toward the bank, moving now,

heading right toward the front door, transfixed, as the

SOUND DROPS out and he begins to smile --

SCREEEECH!

A car HITS Henry in the side. He's knocked down.

A GIRL (30s)

Rushes out of the car.

She hangs up.

Henry's a little delirious.

He grabs his thigh. Winces with pain. Tries to get up.

The bank Guard FRANK rushes over.

Cars are honking now as Henry limps his way over to the

sidewalk.

She jumps back in her car and pulls it over to the side.

Frank comes over to Henry, takes his arm.

INT. ORPHEUM CAFE - CONTINUOUS

Frank sets Henry down in a chair at one of the tables by

the door.

Julie comes in.

Frank leaves.

Henry just stares at her. For a long moment.

He keeps staring...

A beat.

It takes Julie a moment.

A beat.

An awkward moment.

She leaves. He watches her go.

Hobbles down the hallway. He notices the photos on the

wall. A series of HISTORICAL SHOTS of OLD BUFFALO.

INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Henry peeing. His eyes drift to the photos on the wall to

his right.

He zeroes in on a prohibition-era newspaper framed FRONT

PAGE.

A photo of COPS IN TRENCH COATS posing in front of THE

FIRST BUFFALO BANK WITH CRATES OF SEIZED BOOZE.

`WHISKY IN THE VAULT!'

ON HENRY'S FACE

The sound of Henry's Pee STOPS.

He takes a step closer to the next urinal over. Reads the

rest of it...

A COP IN A TUNNEL, smiling as he points up to a HOLE :

After a moment Henry starts peeing again. Thinking about

what he's just read...

EXT. ORPHEUM CAFE - DAY

Henry comes out. Stares at the bank across the street.

Looks both ways and then crosses the road.

EXT. BACK ALLEY - DAY

Henry stands in the back alley behind the bank, feeling

the place out...his head turns between the back door of

the bank and the back of the building opposite...then

looks down at his feet.

He looks up again, notices the :

He goes over to it. It's locked.

INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - DAWN

Henry's still in his clothes, lying on his bed, his mind

reeling, the TV on low....

He gets out of bed. Puts his foot in his boot.

INT. VISITOR'S AREA - DAY

Henry sits at a visitor's table, waiting. A moment

passes, a DOOR CLANKS open and --

Emerges with a guard.

Henry smiles.

He goes to hug him.

They sit. They look at each other a moment.

A beat. Henry leans in.

Pause.

Henry looks around. Closer --

Pause.

Pause.

A beat. Henry looks at Max now. He looks frail.

A long beat. Max gets up :

Max exits.

EXT. BUFFALO STREET - DAY

Henry stares at the bank again...then walks down Mecca

Road glimpses the marquee of `THE ORPHEUM' theatre.

DAREK MILLODRAGOVIC's `THE CHERRY ORCHARD' by Anton

Henry approaches, takes in the large photo of Darek and

the PLAY POSTER, featuring a TREE, for the upcoming

Each `tree branch' of this poster dangles a small cherry-

shaped PHOTO of the various ACTORS starring in it,

including JULIE IVANOVA, the girl who ran Henry over, as

Madame Ranevsky.

A black and white American flag wrapped around the trunk

of the cherry tree with bloody roots.

Henry regards this with some interest, tries the theatre

door.

This one's open.

INT. ORPHEUM THEATRE - DAY

Henry enters the lobby. The light is low. There's

something almost magical about this place.

Henry hears VOICES drifting in from the main theatre as

he continues to walk, heading toward the sounds..

INT. MAIN THEATRE - CONTINUOUS

Henry enters the back of the theatre...sees the girl on

The girl who hit him with her car. She's in mid-speech :

Henry's transfixed. She's good. ARNOLD, regional actor

extraordinaire, plays Lophakin :

He chews up the scenery.

DAREK, the CZECH DIRECTOR -- greasy-haired, balding and

smoking -- stands up in his seat in the stalls.

He points to JULIE.

Julie cocks her ear, mockingly. Darek marches up to her.

They stare each other down.

He snatches the cup from her hand.

Julie marches off stage...

Watches as Julie comes up the aisle. She notices him.

She doesn't wait, just walks right past...

Henry follows.

She exits.

EXT. ORPHEUM THEATRE - OUTSIDE

Henry catches up. She crosses the street, ignoring the

traffic. Henry follows.

They reach the Cafe. He opens the door for her :

She looks at him, curiously.

INT. CAFE ORPHEUM - DAY

They enter. It's busy.

She points at Henry.

They stand right there at the bar. Silence.

Henry notices the play poster on the wall over her

shoulder. Looks at it. Then back at her. Comparing her

photo to the live person.

She turns to see what he's looking at. A beat.

She smiles. Pierre puts the coffees down on the bar.

She starts dropping cubes of sugar in her cup.

Henry's interested.

Pause.

She drinks her coffee.

She thinks. He listens.

She downs the last of her coffee.

She leaves.

He watches her through the glass as she walks across the

street...right past the bank on her way back to the

theatre.

INT. PRISON - MORNING

MAX's cell door opens. He walks, happy and confident this

morning.

As Max reaches the end of the walkway, an OLD GUARD opens

the next steel door for him.

The Guard smiles as he leads him toward the PAROLE BOARD

ROOM at the end of another long corridor.

They stop at the door.

Pause.

The Guard shakes his head, opens the door for him.

INT. PAROLE REVIEW ROOM, PRISON - DAY

A PAROLE BOARD OFFICER is reading Max's file as he enters.

The OFFICER gestures to the chair. The other members of

the Board stare at Max.

The head Parole officer leafs through page after page of

denied applications. Max watches the pages turning, the

years of his life going by, taking it in...

They all wait for Max's answer. He's silent.

Closer on Max. He looks like he might start to twitch at

any moment....

EXT. PRISON GATE - DAY

The gigantic PRISON GATES clank open. Max emerges, a tiny

figure against the imposing facade. He's holding a small

black valise. Looks like it was made in the 40s.

Max looks a little less sure of himself.

Appears. Smiling.

Max looks around nervously.

Max turns....walks back towards the gates. Starts to

POUND on them.

No response.

Henry approaches. Takes Max's bag.

Max starts to hyperventilate :

Henry hesitates a moment, puts an arm around him...

Henry helps Max back up again.

EXT. BUS - DAY

A GREYHOUND BUS rumbles through the countryside.

INT. BUS - DAY

Henry and Max sit up front right next to the driver. Max

has his eyes closed. He still looks woozy.

He opens his bag and pulls out a sandwich. Offers it to

him.

Max doesn't say anything.

A beat. Max opens one eye...

A KEY GOING INTO A LOCK...

INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Henry opens the door for Max. They enter.

Henry indicates the tiny bed in the corner of the living

room. There are some second hand books on the bedside

table like `Future Shock' by Alvin Toffler and

Dostoyevsky.

Max goes over, looks at the books. Sits down on the bed.

A beat.

INT. HENRY'S BATHROOM - LATER

Max reclines in the steaming TUB, luxuriating in the warm

water. He closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, and

relaxes.

After a moment he notices a fancy-looking bottle on the side.

Pours it into his bath.

EXT. BUFFALO STREET - DAY

As they cross a street, Max notices a coffee shop on the

other side.

They walk into the Cafe Orpheum.

INT. CAFE ORPHEUM, BATHROOM -- DAY

Max looks at him.

Henry looks at him.

INT. FIRST BUFFALO BANK - DAY

Max and Henry walk in to the grand banking hall.

FRANK THE GUARD

Doesn't react.

Frank watches them as they walk toward the CASHIER.

A NAME-PLACARD : `HOWARD TUTTLE, Assistant Manager'.

ON MAX AND HENRY

Sitting in front of his desk.

Max gets up.

Henry and Max walk out past Frank. He watches them

leave...

EXT. ALLEY, BEHIND THE ORPHEUM - A MINUTE LATER

MAX AND HENRY stand in the alley. Henry touches the back

of the bank wall.

He walks across the alley...

He follows it toward the back door of the theatre.

He turns to Max.

Henry laughs. THE DOOR HITS the back of his head as it

SWINGS open.

She storms out, punches the air, screams :

Suddenly notices Max and Henry standing there.

She looks at Max.

Henry shoots Max a look.

The door opens. SIMON, the Stage Manager, pokes his head out.

She laughs. Max approaches her.

She considers the request.

She gestures them inside.

As Henry passes :

INT. THEATRE - SAME TIME

Max walks to centre stage front like he's been there

before. He looks out at the auditorium, a little

emotional all of a sudden.

Simon arrives.

Max and Henry exchange a glance.

Julie and Henry watch them go.

Henry walks out onto the stage where Max was standing,

getting the feel of it.

Beat.

She thinks.

INT. THEATRE BACKSTAGE, DOWNSTAIRS - SAME TIME

Max follows Simon through a tight hallway of DRESSING

ROOMS.

They pass ACTORS eating lunch or playing cards. Nothing

very glamorous.

They enter the Green Room where ARNOLD is holding court.

INT. GREEN ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Other ACTORS look at him with blank faces.

Max gestures Simon closer. With a conspiratorial whisper -

INT. THEATRE - SAME TIME

Henry examines the fake bookshelves on the drawing room

set. Julie sits in an armchair eating the sandwich she's

pulled out of her bag.

She watches him a moment.

Henry crosses the stage, goes to sit in the chair

opposite her.

A beat.

ON JULIE. She wasn't expecting that.

She takes a big bite of her sandwich.

She studies him.

She studies him some more.

He laughs.

She laughs. Then stops. Dead serious :

EXT. DRESSING ROOM - SAME TIME

A taped paper sign on the door reads `LOPHAKIN please

knock'. Simon opens it for Max, shows him inside.

INT. DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

A costume on hangers. A wig and beard in front of the

mirror.

Simon walks into the room. Places his hand on the far wall.

Max comes up. Feels it now too.

Max pads the wall like it's a good old friend, testing

it...searching...

Max stops. Turns to Simon, and with a broad smile :

INT. STAGE - SAME TIME

Henry picks up a marked-up text of the Cherry Orchard

that's on one of the chairs.

Julie gets up out of her chair.

She looks at him.

Max's voice booms :

Max comes right up to them.

They look at each other as ACTORS return to the stage.

DAREK moves towards his place in the front seats.

Max grabs Henry --

Henry waves.

He glares at them as they pass...

on the side of the tub as he draws the bath...

Henry places it between a PLATE and a NAPKIN, linking

them together like...a tunnel...

INT. GOLDEN DRAGON - RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Henry waits for Julie. He's all cleaned up. Fresh shirt.

She sits. Looks at the menu. A GUY who's leaving, sees her :

The guy glances at Henry. Leaves.

She studies the menu.

She puts it down. No answer.

INT. RESTAURANT - LATER

PLATES ARE CLEARED

It's the end of the meal. Henry listens.

He doesn't.

The waitress brings over the check and the fortune

cookies.

INT. JULIE'S CAR - LATER

Julie sings along to the radio, smoking half a joint from

the ashtray.

Henry watches her. Julie knows she's being watched. She's

enjoying herself.

Henry shakes his head no. She turns the radio up.

HENRY AND JULIE

Walk along a precipice near some railings. They move

closer to the ROAR.

They look out at the flood-lit NIAGARA FALLS. Stand there

a moment...

They both stare down into the roaring water.

They start to walk...

He nods. She's probably right.

She laughs.

Pause.

He looks at her. Decides :

She looks out the falls.

A beat. We can't tell what she's thinking...

INT. JULIE'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Henry leans against the sink watching Julie at the table

eating Ice Cream. There's music on in the b.g.

They watch one another for a moment. She takes a big

spoonful.

She gets up.

She moves through into the lounge. Henry follows.

She starts moving around the room, dancing to the music.

She sits down.

Henry's not sure what she's talking about.

She gestures to her copy of `THE CHERRY ORCHARD' on the

coffee table.

Henry opens it.

She points to the right place. Henry, awkwardly :

He stops, looks at her :

Henry takes a beat.

This time he makes it his.

She laughs like a little girl.

He laughs.

Henry's getting into it.

She laughs some more. Comes closer.

Henry puts the book down.

They kiss...

INT. JULIE'S APARTMENT -- MORNING

Henry and Julie asleep in the bed. She opens her eyes.

Realizes he's there with her...as if sensing her, he

opens his eyes too.

They look at one another.

She climbs on top of him. Henry smiles.

INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - MORNING

Sun streams in through the window. Tchaikovsky plays on a

tiny transistor radio. Max humming to the music, reading

`Future Shock' on the toilet.

The sound of the front door of the apartment opening --

HENRY is standing right there, holding a bag of

groceries, JULIE is right next to him. Max goes white.

He's in his underwear.

Max is frozen.

She laughs a little. Max looks at Henry like `what the

fuck?'

Henry enters the kitchen...leaving Max and Julie there.

Max follows Henry into the kitchen.

INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME

Henry unpacks the groceries.

Pause.

Max leaves the kitchen for the front room where Julie's

waiting, amused by the whole thing.

Max just stands there in his underwear a moment, sizing

her up.

They eat.

Max slurps his coffee.

She considers this.

He glances at Henry.

Julie looks at Henry now...

Henry doesn't answer, starts to collect the plates.

He turns to her.

Beat.

She downs her coffee. Stands.

She regards him a moment.

INT. ORPHEUM THEATRE - DAY

Julie as Madame Ranevsky. Her brother GAYEV and her

daughter VARYA are also on stage.

Watching from the back of the theatre in the semi-

darkness.

He's transfixed.

Max watches too. He wears his volunteer badge.

A PROJECTION OF THE MOTHER FLOATS ACROSS THE SCREEN and

dissolves into one of the Cherry Trees...

Henry and Max speak in hushed voices :

Max leaves....after a moment he stops where he

is...freezes...

...then turns back to Henry...

Henry stares at Julie, mid performance, on the stage.

Henry thinks...

Max thinks...

Max, frustrated :

On Henry...

Walks down the street. It's snowing. He approaches the

theatre.

INT. THEATRE, BACKSTAGE - MORNING

Arnold enters, shivering, shaking the snow off his

coat...

None of the actors pay him much attention. He pours

himself a cup of coffee, makes his way toward his

dressing room.

EXT. DRESSING ROOM - MORNING

Arnold opens the door with his key.

INT. THEATRE DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Arnold enters, hangs up his coat. There is a FORMAL

ENVELOPE leaning against his make-up mirror.

He approaches. Opens it. Starts to read...

As he absorbs the words he lets out a small gasp..

and...falls into his chair.

After a moment he puts down the letter and stares at

himself in the mirror.

He closes his eyes. Bows his head. Starts to weep...

INT. THEATRE - MORNING

CLOSE ON DAREK : the veins on the side of his forehead

pulsate with rage...

INT. THEATRE - MORNING

Julie stands in the wings. Max joins her.

DAREK AND ARNOLD

on the stage. Simon behind them. Darek is right in

Arnold marches off the stage with his case.

Darek ingests caffeine and nicotine at an alarming rate :

He moves stage left past Julie...

And with that he disappears with Olga out the door.

Beat.

She shoots him a look, picks up her stuff and goes...

EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

Julie, on the phone, searches for her keys in the bag as

she approaches her car.

She gets in the car. Tries to find a roach in the

ashtray. A KNOCK at the passenger window.

She looks up. It's MAX.

He gestures, `Can I come in?'. Max gets in.

It takes a moment till her mind gets a hold of the idea.

She laughs.

A beat. She does think about it.

She hesitates...

She regards him. Suspiciously.

He smiles. A beat :

She SLAPS him hard across the cheek.

They just sit there for a moment...

She thinks...

She thinks some more...

INT. DAREK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Julie sits, looking at Henry who stands in the middle of

the living room of Darek's apartment...

Circles HENRY...walking around him...an animal tracking

its pray...he's chain-smoking...

He glances at Julie. Then back at Henry.

Darek nods, continue :

Darek pushes Henry closer to Julie. She stands :

Henry ignores him and with twice the passion --

Darek laughs, circling...

Henry takes her hand now...his voice drops...

His yearning is suddenly palpable. Intense. Tender.

Henry drops to his knees, supplicates.

Henry just breathes. He's unbreakable.

A beat.

Henry looks up.

Darek considers him.

Henry and Julie share a look. He actually did it.

INT. JULIE'S CAR -- NIGHT - MOVING

She drives. Henry rides shotgun. They both look at the

road ahead. In silence.

After a while...

A beat.

She smiles.

INT. JULIE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

They make love. It's more intense than before. They

climax.

They lie there, breathless, looking at each other...

INT. KITCHEN TABLE - LATE AT NIGHT

She makes tea. Henry sits at the table watching her.

He doesn't answer.

It takes a moment for him to answer.

Henry smiles.

She gets the honey out of the cupboard. Pours some in her

tea.

A beat.

She turns to him.

INT. ORPHEUM THEATRE STAGE - MORNING

Darek addresses the full cast. Henry by his side.

He leads a light round of applause. Henry acknowledges

Henry walks briskly away. Julie watches him...

INT. ORPHEUM THEATRE - MORNING

Henry enters his dressing room, locking the door behind

him. Max is already waiting. He turns the music on.

They move the GIANT ARMOIRE that's against the wall

aside.

Max spreads a blanket on the floor to catch the falling

rubble and holds another against the wall to muffle the

sound.

Henry pulls a sledgehammer out of a bag :

WHACK!

He POUNDS the wall AGAIN and AGAIN...

INT. TUNNEL - LATER

The blanket is pulled aside to reveal MAX AND HENRY on

the other side looking in. Max shines his flashlight

THE EMPTY OLD TUNNEL BEYOND

It's dusty. Max climbs through the hole, disappears down

the tunnel. Henry follows, counting his steps...

INT. OLD TUNNEL - DAY

Max and Henry, stooped over, make their way down the

dank, dark passage.

Max's flashlight combs the floor. A glint of light now as

something FLASHES.

The beam scours the blackness ahead looking for the

end....and there it is. A soot-covered WALL maybe ten

feet ahead.

They reach it. Henry touches the damp, decrepit brick,

turns to Max.

He turns back to him :

EXT. `GAMETIME' SPORTS BAR, BUFFALLO OLD TOWN - NIGHT

It's cold out. Max and Henry walk inside.

INT. `GAMETIME' SPORTS BAR, BUFFALLO OLD TOWN - NIGHT

A giant screen showing the game. Henry and Max arrive at

the bar.

Henry and Max watch as JOE grabs his head, flops into a chair.

Max looks concerned.

INT. BOOTH - LATER

Henry and Max sit with the guy -- JOE who's drunk.

Joe is looking worse for wear.

Joe hits his Schooner Longneck.

Joe drains his beer. The WAITRESS arrives with a bucket

of steaming wings.

He grabs a wing. Rips off the meat.

Henry takes it in.

Joe keeps going on the wings. He's making a meal of it...

A beat.

Max shoots a look at Henry. Joe chugs a glass of water,

looking at both of them now.

INT. TUNNEL - DAY

Henry, Max and Joe stand hunched over at the end of the

tunnel.

Max studies Joe.

Considering it...

He picks up a shovel and CRUNCHES into the wall of dirt.

INT. JULIE'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- NIGHT

Henry and Julie are in bed. He memorizes his lines. The

TV's on low. Julie's Buffaloto commercial comes on. Julie

snaps it off.

She looks at him.

He thinks carefully before he says it :

She gets out of bed. Throws on her robe.

INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

We follow Henry as he walks through her apartment and

finds Julie in the kitchen, standing at the sink, not

moving.

Silence...

She turns to face him.

On Henry.

Silence.

Henry just stands there...stunned.

EXT. BUFFALO STREET - NIGHT

Henry leaves Julie's apartment. There's snow on the

ground. It's freezing out here.

He starts to walk.

INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Max hungrily munches his cheerios at the table.

Henry sits across from him.

Max looks at him. About to say something --

A KNOCK at the door.

Henry walks to the door.

Henry opens it. JOE stands there. He's drunk. And a

little sheepish. Now we see why : EDDIE VIBES is standing

right beside him. He walks right on in.

Eddie beams at Max.

Max looks at Henry : `huh?'

Joe lies down on the floor. He's drunk as a skunk.

He sits.

Eddie laughs. Leans back on it.

MAX AND HENRY

At the window. Looking down as EDDIE gets into his car.

He senses them watching him. Turns around. Gives them the

thumbs up.

INT. APARTMENT - SAME TIME

Max and Henry watch Eddie leave.

He looks over at Joe on the floor. Thinks about how easy

it would be to just kick him in the head.

INT. STAGE - DAY

Henry in period costume. He has a beard. He watches from

the stalls as they run a dress rehearsal.

ON HENRY, feeling like the accused. From the stage Julie

sees him.

She locks eyes with Henry now :

Julie walks off the stage. She knows Henry is waiting for

her.

She walks on. He follows...

She turns.

INT. DRESSING ROOM - LATER

Henry arrives to find Max attaching one of the bags of

dirt to a pulley. Above them, Joe begins to hoist it up

through the open skylight.

Henry looks up.

Henry goes to the open doors of the Armoire. The tunnel

is deeper now and all lit up...

EXT. PARKING LOT BEHIND THE THEATRE - LATER

Henry, Max and Joe make their way toward Joe's car.

Before he can answer :

They turn. FRANK, the bank guard, is standing right

there. He's in his street clothes.

Frank sucks his teeth.

Henry, Max and Joe look at each other. Frank moves

closer. Checks around to make sure no one can hear them.

Frank snickers.

Max looks at Henry.

INT. JOE'S CAR - DRIVING

Joe's driving. Max is in the passenger seat. Henry in the

back next to Frank.

They exchange glances.

They're listening...

Now they're paying attention.

A beat. He leans closer...

Frank grabs Joe. Glares into his eyes.

A beat.

The moment just hangs there...

He turns to Henry.

EXT. THEATRE - MORNING

MAX and HENRY walk up to the theatre. They've got

coffees. It's drizzling.

They both look up.

ON THE MARQUEE : "Chekhov's `The Cherry Orchard'...Opens

NOVEMBER 23rd, 8 PM"

Henry thinks...

Max turns.

Henry absorbs that. Looks at Max.

EXT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

AN AMBULANCE Peels into the drive. A PATIENT is wheeled

inside.

INT. HOSPITAL, EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT

Walking down a corridor toward a NURSE'S STATION at the

far end.

The doors open for him...he hesitates

DEBBIE in profile, smiling and talking to a seated

receptionist who touches her very pregnant belly.

Henry takes a step back, the doors close. He watches

through the glass a moment...

Debbie looks radiant. Peaceful. Happy.

Walks back outside again. It's as if he got all the

answers he needed...

INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT

Max and Joe are digging. Looks like they've been at it

for hours - covered in dirt and sweat. Henry enters the

tunnel.

Henry picks up his shovel. Starts to dig. He goes at it

hard.

Max catches his mood.

He turns to Max.

He throws down his shovel.

Joe furiously digs his shovel into the caked-in dirt

above his head. Suddenly the ceiling of dirt comes free

burying Joe who struggles to get out.

Above, from where the dirt once was, is the smooth

surface of concrete. The bottom of the vault.

Joe gets to his feet - he looks dazed.

INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Henry and Max are finished packing up the apartment.

Henry looks out the window. A beautiful clear blue sky.

great evening of theatre.

The cast, dressed for stage, is gathered in the green

room, chatting nervously to one another.

Standing on opposite sides of the room.

Hush descends as DAREK walks in.

avoiding Henry's gaze.

He leaves. The players applaud --

Everyone laughs.

INT. JULIE'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Julie sits by her vanity finishing her make-up. A knock

on the door.

Henry appears. She's surprised.

She sits there...

He approaches her...

She laughs. That's so ridiculous to her.

That cuts him dead.

A beat. He leaves.

INT. THEATRE - NIGHT

Max helps seat some elderly people.

He checks his watch...it's two minutes to eight. He walks

briskly up the aisle...

INT. FIRST BUFFALO BANK - NIGHT

Frank watches through the glass doors out onto the empty

street.

He looks at his watch, sucks his teeth.

INT. THEATER - SAME TIME

On a headset. Points to Henry.

ON HENRY, watching the curtain start to rise...

THE CURTAIN COMES UP TO REVEAL :

a long white post-modern room. Sounds of wind. It's may

but frosty.

Through the windows. CHERRY TREES in full bloom which

contrast with the stark modernity of the nursery set.

They're BIG SCREEN projections on real tree trunks :

LOPHAKIN enters with DUNYASHA, holding a candelabra.

Henry yawns and stretches.

AN ARMORED BANK TRUCK

Rounds a corner into view...

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

...pulls up right in front of the First Buffalo Bank.

BERNIE and STAN jump out. Bernie knocks on the glass door.

He un-holsters his weapon, covers as Stan opens the back

of the truck.

Through the glass, Frank smiles.

He sucks his teeth.

EXT. BACK DOOR - THEATRE

Max bursts out the back door of the theatre, his walk

turning into a run...

INT. THEATRE - SAME TIME

Julie as Madame Ranevksy enters the nursery in rapt

delight.

Henry as Lophakin turns to face her, waiting for her to

She kisses Gayev and Varya and then Gayev again. She

kisses everyone in fact, except Lophakin.

INT. BANK - SAME TIME

Bernie breaks the seal of an envelope, hands it to Stan.

Frank unlocks the plastic casing to the VAULT KEYPAD for

was inside the envelope.

Frank reaches into his pocket. We glimpse his phone. He

presses `SEND'...

EXT. POWER POLE - SAME TIME

Max struggles to the top of a telephone pole by an open

electrical box. His cell phone vibrates. He pulls it out,

reads it.

He unzips a fanny pack, pulls out a WIRE CUTTER, but his

hands are trembling and he drops it...

Thirty feet to the ground.

CRACK!

INT. STAGE - SAME TIME

Standing next to Simon, Henry watches Julie perform from

the side of the stage.

She looks out toward the window through which there is

now a projection of the ORCHARD, this time in autumnal

decay...

INT. BANK - SAME TIME

Waiting...as he and Bernie watch Stan load the money into

the vault.

Frank laughs nervously.

EXT. ALLEY - SAME TIME

He finally finds the right one and CUTS IT :

to prepare the charges...

A muffled BOOM (o.s.)

Another muffled BOOM (o.s.) this time the audience looks

around. Julie glares at him.

INT. TUNNEL ROOM - NIGHT

Henry rushes in to the tunnel to find Joe and Max staring

at the underside of the steel bank vault. It's like a

gleaming jewel.

Henry reaches up, touches the steel vault bottom, rubs

it.

Eddie arrives in his protection suit, holding a thermite

burning tool.

They scramble out. He puts his protective helmet on.

Lights it. It's like an inferno

INT. TUNNEL - SAME TIME

WHITE HEAT AND SPARKS

EDDIE's manic face behind the mask, a man possessed,

screaming, a river of molten steel dripping down right in

front of him.

KRUUUNK! The bottom of the vault drops onto the ground.

INT. TUNNEL - A MINUTE LATER

Smoke clears to reveal EDDIE. He pulls off his hood.

They all look up at THE HOLE.

INT. VAULT - A FEW MINUTES LATER

as his head rises into view through the newly cut hole.

He climbs in and touches the saran-wrapped STACK OF CASH,

subdivided into bricks.

He sits on it. Thinking...

It's dead quiet in here.

Max pops his head up. Stares at the cash :

INT. STAGE - CONTINUOUS

Audience's POV as Madame Ranevsky faces Lophakin on the

other side of the stage. It's like a showdown.

Pause.

Madame Ranevsky is overwhelmed by the news. Varya takes

INT. VAULT -- SAME TIME

EDDIE, JOE AND MAX

Stuff duffel bags full of cash.

INT. STAGE - NIGHT

Lophakin swirls on stage...

INT. TUNNEL ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER

EDDIE, JOE AND MAX

Finish lining up the duffels of cash by the door.

Max freezes, suddenly notices Eddie is standing there

with A GUN pointed at him and Joe.

Max doesn't seem so surprised.

Joe doesn't move. Eddie waves the gun.

Max boldly steps right in front of the gun.

Eddie puts the gun to Max's stomach.

Eddie smiles.

Eddie PUNCHES Max in the gut, then pops him in the head

as he throws him back.

The door swings open -- HENRY -- walks in on the scene...

Seeing the gun, Henry freezes at the door. Eddie's in the

middle, Max and Joe by the mouth of the tunnel, Max on

the floor, a gash on his forehead from Eddie's blow.

Eddie turns at him.

Eddie kicks him again.

He turns back to Henry.

He gestures to the tunnel.

Joe suddenly turns back, grabs Eddie's gun hand from

behind. THE GUN GOES OFF. They wrestle. Joe bites Eddie's

hand.

Max, straddling Eddie, grabs his head, bangs it on the

Henry, a little dazed, picks up the gun.

He does. They roll Eddie over, start to hog tie his hands

then his legs.

Eddie starts to freak out.

Max stuffs a glove into Eddie's mouth but Eddie still

kicks like crazy.

Max notices Henry's thigh.

Henry sees it now too. It's a graze.

Henry hears the tannoy. It's his cue. He's late.

He rushes out...

INT. STAGE - CONTINUOUS

On stage, the lights come up revealing a LINE OF HOODED

FACELESS FIGURES standing behind the scrim, axes by their

side.

They walk out onto the stage...

Lophakin rushes on stage. He's late. Yasha, holding a

tray with small tumblers of champagne, shoots him a look.

cash to the line of hooded figures.

Gayev and Madame Ranevsky walk past Lophakin, ignoring

him on their way out.

Trofimov exits with Anya. Varya looks around the room and

exits. Yasha and Carlotta exit with the dog.

Lophakin to Madame Ranevsky and Gayev :

As he and Julie exchange a final look. She watches him

go...it's as if he's moving in slow motion...

EXT. THEATRE - MOMENTS LATER

Henry comes out the back door. Gets in the car.

Joe guns it.

Sitting in the back.

INT. STAGE -- SAME TIME

The Peasants/hooded figures raise their axes. They

suddenly have the manner of executioners...

They stand ready to fell Madame Ranevsky's beloved

orchard.

The sound of the HOODED FIGURES as they chop the trees

behind her. It's horrific.

Madame Ranevsky holds her hands over her ears and falls

to the ground...and begins to weep...

Henry starts to run back toward the theatre as best he

can...

But he's already gone...

The HOODED FIGURES finish destroying the orchard. TREES

litter the stage...

Madame Ranevsky still holds her hands over her ears on

the ground...

As the cacophony ends, she gets up slowly and turns to

walk off the stage...

RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER

Coming down the aisle is

HENRY as LOPHAKIN

Pause.

He comes closer. He's limping slightly....

ON JULIE, in shock.

He steps up on the stage...

She looks out to the audience. EAGER FACES awaiting

Madame Ranevsky's response...

She tries to get past him. He blocks her.

He grabs her.

She tries to get away again...

Pause.

She kicks out at him.

That hits her. Pause. She breaks away from him, stepping

back...

On the side of the stage.

She searches his expression now...

She can't move. The audience is rapt.

There are tears in her eyes now...

at the back of the theatre. Stunned :

JULIE AND HENRY

She whispers softly. Looks down at his leg.

IN THE BACK

Darek is alive once more...

Julie and Henry in silhouette now.

The lights fade, as an image of WHITE CHERRY BLOSSOMS

appears on the projection screen...

FADE UP ON :

EXT. THE LOIRE VALLEY, FRANCE - DAY

...which become REAL BLOSSOMS on a CHERRY TREE, widening

to reveal an orchard, the most beautiful you've ever

seen.

A STONE FARM HOUSE

Frank sits at a table outside in the garden. He pours

himself a Pernod. He looks happy as a clam.

A CAT jumps in his lap, purring.

He looks out at the lush valley below. Smiles.

THE SOUND OF A CRYING BABY

INT. PRIVATE DELIVERY ROOM, SOMEWHERE IN NEW MEXICO -

A state of the art hospital room. No expense has been

spared. A shaky image of DEB's face as JOE frames the

video camera.

THE BABY comes into view now. It's beautiful. And

screaming its little lungs out.

A NURSE hands the baby to Debbie. Joe looks on, tears

stream down his face.

EXT. FORT LAUDERDALE - DAY

We follow A MAILMAN past a row of palm trees as he enters

a traditional-looking BARBER SHOP : "MAX'S - A PLACE FOR

The Mailman hands a few letters to the pretty front desk

GIRL. Max, his back to us, finishes a shave, talking his

customer's ear off.

The Guy nods. Max turns. We see him now. He's super tan.

He pulls the sheet off his client.

Another YOUNG CUSTOMER sits down. There's a few of them

waiting their turn, enjoying Max's schtick.

The front desk girl hands Max the mail.

CLOSE ON A POSTCARD : `Our dream is our truth is our

destiny...Love H... xx'

Max smiles. Flips over the postcard and only now when he

pins it above the mirror do we finally see what it is --

an image of THE HOLLYWOOD SIGN.

THE SOUND OF BREATHING

Fade up on : what looks like the AFRICAN BUSH.

It's hot. There are insects buzzing around and it doesn't

look like rain's landed anywhere near here in years.

A HAND reaches out for another HAND, helping someone over

the final step.

REVEAL HENRY AND JULIE

Sitting right below the Hollywood sign now...

Looking down on the whole basin of Los Angeles. She hands

him a bottle of water. He drinks.

He puts his arm around her.

She laughs...they kiss in the sun for a while...

FADE TO BLACK

CREDITS START TO ROLL...

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - BUFFALO - DAY

EDDIE VIBES is being questioned by the unseen DETECTIVE.

WHAACK! The slap knocks Eddie to the ground. He's under

the table now, his face crushed by the Detective's BOOT :

He presses his boot down harder ON EDDIE'S FACE :

Eddie smiles. His face squashed sideways like that, it's

a pretty strange kind of smile...
