They arrive and ring the doorbell.

CUT TO:

173 INT. RAHAD JACKSON'S HOUSE - NIGHT - THAT MOMENT

A really big fat black BODYGUARD comes to the door and opens up:

The bodyguard leads them down a hall and into a tacky and spacious, sunken

LIVING ROOM.

They're greeted by a man in a silk robe, slightly open to show some bikini

briefs and a thin sheen of sweat covering his body: RAHAD JACKSON (late

40s).

Off in a corner of the room, a YOUNG ASIAN KID is casually throwing some

FIRECRACKERS around.

Rahad is DANCING around by himself to NIGHT RANGER, "SISTER CHRISTIAN." He

spots the men;

The Bodyguard brings over a PAPER BAG FULL OF CASH and hands the bag to

Todd in exchange for the PAPER BAG FULL OF BAKING SODA.

Reed watches the Bodyguard take the bag and notices something. REED'S POV:

a SHOULDER HOLSTER holds a .45 Automatic Pistol.

Rahad does an air guitar solo to the Night Ranger song . . . he walks

across the room, picks up a COKE PIPE and looks to the guys;

Rahad strokes the pipe while dancing. Dirk looks across to an open bedroom

door.

DIRK'S POV: Through the crack in the door, we can see a bloody, battered

YOUNG BLACK WOMAN in a silk robe . . .she's followed by another YOUNG WHITE

GIRL in nothing.

He takes out a nickel plated REVOLVER and loads a single bullet, spins the

chamber and puts it to his head and sings;

He pulls the trigger . . . Click . . . he smiles and casually speaks;

The Night Ranger song FADES OUT . . . BEAT . . . Rahad smiles at the Asian

Kid who's casually throwing some firecrackers around.

REO SPEEDWAGON, "CAN'T FIGHT THIS FEELING," begins to play.

Dirk and Rahad continue to haggle about leaving/not leaving. CAMERA BEGINS

A SLOW DOLLY INTO A CU ON TODD.

Dirk and Reed look at Todd. He stands up.

The Bodyguard turns his head. Dirk and Reed are confused;

The BODYGUARD reaches into his coat . . .

. . . Todd pulls his REVOLVER quickly and AIMS at the Bodyguard.

. . . Rahad reacts by AIMING HIS GUN AT TODD . . .

Rahad PULLS THE TRIGGER . . . a bullet FIRES from the gun and strikes Todd

in the SHOULDER . . . the gun in his hand falls to the floor and he

stumbles back . . .

. . . The Bodyguard takes this moment to GRAB HIS OWN GUN from the holster

and FIRE off shots at Dirk and Reed . . .

. . . Bullets graze past them and they DUCK FOR COVER . . .

. . . The GIRLS in the bedroom SCREAM and SHOUT at the gunfire . . .

. . . A STRAY BULLET HITS the ASIAN KID in the heart, but he doesn't fall .

. .

. . . TODD reaches hold of his gun, crouches for cover and FIRES a bullet

STRAIGHT INTO the Bodyguard . . . who falls back DEAD . . . Todd looks

right and sees:

RAHAD scuttles into the bedroom with the women . . . Todd looks over his

shoulder to Dirk and Reed;

Todd gets up and heads for the bedroom with his revolver at the ready . . .

he inches closer to the door and twists the door knob, then KICKS THE DOOR

OPEN;

. . . Rahad is standing right there, holding a SAWED OFF SHOTGUN. He pulls

the trigger . . . Todd blinks . . .

. . . Rahad's SHOTGUN BLAST blows Todd BACK and UP in the air about fifteen

feet . . . he FALLS to the ground with a HOLE in his STOMACH about the size

of a basketball . . . Rahad calls out to Dirk and Reed;

Rahad peers out from his bedroom, sees a sliver of Dirk behind the wall.

Rahad FIRES HIS SHOTGUN . . . which cuts right past Dirk's head and SHREDS

the wall near him . . .

Reed and Dirk make a DASH for the front door . . .

. . . Rahad FIRES another shot . . .

. . . a BLAST BREEZES PAST THEIR HEADS . . .

Dirk and Reed make it OUTSIDE . . . Rahad chases after them . . .

SHOTGUN BLAST BLOWS INTO THE PASSENGER'S SIDE DOOR --

crouched -- he opens the door and starts to get in --

ANOTHER SHOT BLOWS THE PASSENGER'S SIDE WINDOW OUT.

GLASS SPRAYS IN HIS EYES AND HIS HAND SLIPS DOWN, RELEASING THE EMERGENCY

BRAKE OF THE CAR -- WHICH BEGINS TO ROLL DOWN THE STREET--

Dirk stumbles back from the car. He looks to the house:

Rahad is about to FIRE the shotgun again . . .

. . . he looks down the street: the Corvette is ROLLING away and picking up

speed as it goes down the hill --

Dirk gets on his feet and makes a run for the car, Rahad FIRES . . .
