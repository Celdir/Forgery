Okay.

What about the Warrens, did you

call them?

Yeah, they said they'll make it

some evening soon.

"Joey Georgella. New football coach

for Trinity."

Did you check with Jane for the

Michigan State tickets?

Yes. She'll talk to John.

Where's Conrad? This'll get

cold.

Con!

Will you drop those suits at the

cleaners for me?

They won't be back by Saturday.

That's okay. Connie!

Conrad!

I'll be right there!

Here he is!

Morning.

Morning.

Morning.

Did you sleep?

Yeah.

Hungry?

Uh...uh... hungry, uh?

It's French toast. It's your

favorite.

Yeah.

Uh... I'm not really hungry.

Breakfast, pal, remember? Main

meal. Energy!

You're not hungry, you're not

hungry!

Wait a minute, Beth, Hang on. He's

gonna eat it. Come on.

It's French toast.

There's fresh fruit for you when

you get home from school later.

What are you doing? What are you

doing?

You can't save French toast.

Listen, I've got to run. I'm

playing at nine. Will you please

call Mr. Herman about the shutters?

I can't get anywhere with that man.

You have to charm Mr. Herman. Did

you charm him?

You have to eat, Con. We just

want you keep on getting

stronger.

Dad, I'm not hungry.

Are you okay?

Yeah. I got to go. Lazenby's

picking me up.

Oh. Is he? Great!

Why is it great?

Well. I don't see the old gang much

anymore. I miss them. Bring them

around... Phil, Don, and Dick Van

Buren. We'll play some touch

football on the lawn.

See you later.

Con!

Get a sense of reality, Lazenby.

What you reading?

Meditation!

Hardy.

You guys tried meditation?

Meditation?

It's just like thinking, Stillman.

No, I don't do it too often.

Ain't that junior English? You got

all junior classes this year? They

didn't pass you on anything?

Stillman, you know they don't

pass you on... breathing in that

dump if you don't take the final.

Hey, man, get something on that

radio, really. You know, I gotta

study.

Get something lighter for your

head.

I hope it's a long train. I've

got to get the stuff down. I'm

gonna flunk this test.

We're going to be late.

Does my hair look like shit,

doesn't it?

Yeah.

Yes, it looks like shit. Thanks.

Hey, hey, hey! Hey, there's Pratt.

Look at that ass!

Let me out, I need a jump.

No dirty stuff out of the window.

No dirty stuff?

Pratt! You have nice ...knees!

Hey. Interested in something.

Jarrett?

How about we discuss some theory,

here? Conrad, what's your theory on

Jude Fawley? Conrad?

What's your theory on Jude Fawley?

Uh...

Do you think he was powerless in

the grip of circumstances... or

could he have helped himself?

I don't... Uh...Powerless? I guess he

thought he was, yeah.

The guy was a real jerk. He was

hung up on what was the moral thing

to do. It didn't make any sense.

I think that's a little too easy,

Joel. Paul? What do you think?

I found the book hard to follow. I

couldn't figure it out.

Hello?

Hello.

Hello?

Uh, Dr. Berger?

Yes?

Hi. This is Conrad Jarrett calling.

Who?

Conrad Jarrett!

Dr. Crawford at Hillsboro

Hospital gave me your number...

and...

Oh, yes! I'm with a patient now.

Can you call back at two

fifteen?

I don't think I'll be free.

Then give me your number. I'll call

you tonite. Hello? Hello?

Uh, that's OK, I'll try to call you

back. Thanks.

Go!

OK, Come on, now! Move it, you

guys! Move it! Keep it going!

Keep it going! Keep it going!

Come on! Keep plugging! Plugging!

Use those legs! Use those legs!

Lazenby, get with it! Jarrett,

keep your head down!

Work it out there! Work it! Come

on, now! Come on! Push off! Get

your head down. Jarrett! Come on!

Keep it up! Keep it going! Dig!

Dig! Dig in there! Come on! Get

at it! Push on. Jarrett! Push on!

Sharon?

Karen!

Karen.

Conrad, do you want me to sign you

up for round robin at the club?

I haven't played in a year.

Well, don't you think it's time to

start?

Also, Calvin, we have to go to the

Murrays on saturday, I couldn't get

out of it, it's Clark's birthday. I

bought him that book on wine.

Good god, not the Murrays...

Lift the rope off Bucky!

We're going in!

Jarrett?

Come in. Sit down.

I just have to... wire some...

volume.

Ah... sorry. Sit down! You've had

trouble finding the place?

Not yet.

Hmm.... Jarrett. How long since

you've been out of the hospital?

A month and a half.

Feeling depressed?

No.

On stage?

Pardon me?

People nervous... treating you

like you're ...a dangerous character?

Yeah. I guess a little.

Are you?

I don't know.

How long were you in the hospital?

Four months.

What did you do?

I tried to off myself. Isn't it

down there?

It doesn't say what your method

was.

Double-edged Super Blue.

Oh.

So how does it feel being home?

Everybody's glad to see you?

Yeah.

Friends?

Yeah.

OK?

Yeah.

Everything...

Yeah.

You're back in school?

Everything okay at school?

Teachers?

Yeah.

No problems?

Uh-uh.

So why are you here?

Uh... I'd like to be more in

control, I guess.

Why?

So people can quit worrying about

me.

Who's worried about you?

My father, mostly. This is his

idea.

What about your mother? Isn't she

worried about you, too?

I don't know, listen. You... You're

a friend of Dr Crawford, so you're

probably all right, but I'll be

straight with you, I don't like

this already.

Well, as long as you're straight.

What do you know about me?   Have

you talked to Crawford?

Yes. He   called me on the phone. He

told me   your name and... he told me

to look   for you. And, uh... he said

you had   a brother who died. A...

boating   accident, wasn't it? Want

to tell   me about it?

Well I suppose you talked this over

with Crawford at the hospital.

Right?

Right.

How did that go?

It didn't change anything.

Why do you want to change?

I told you, I'd like to be more in

control.

Why?

I told you, so people can quit

worrying about me.

Well. I'll tell you something. I'll

be straight with you, okay? I'm not

big on control. But it's your

money.

So to speak.

So to speak.

Okay...

How's Tuesdays... and Fridays?

Same time.

Twice...   a week?

Well. Control's a tough nut.

I've got swim practice every night.

Well. That's a problem. How do we

solve that?

Guess I'll have to skip practice

twice a week, and come here.

Well. It's up to you.

I don't like being here. I got to

tell you I don't like being here at

all.

Mm-mmm.

I saw Mort Swain. His sister died.

The one from Idaho?

The one with the restaurant.

Did she die in Idaho?

I guess so. Why?

You said she was always traveling.

I just... wondered if she died in

Idaho.

I don't know. Maybe she died in

Idaho. Maybe Kansas City.

I went to see Dr. Berger.

Berger?

Yeah.

Did you?

Yeah.

Good! You didn't say anything.

Good!

I went.

When?

Today.

I didn't know you made an

appointment.

How did it go?

If it's too much money, I don't

have to go. It's not necessary...

Don't worry about the money, it's

okay.

Well it's 50 $ an hour. Twice a

week.

Ah, it's okay. And it is necessary.

What did you talk about?

Not much.

What about your schedule? Will that

be all right?

Well, it'll cut into swim practice.

Where's his office?

Highland Park.

Keep that head straight Genthe! I

don't want to tell you again!

Now, this is what I see.

I see you yawning, I see you

come late. I don't see you

having any fun out there. Are you

getting enough sleep?

Yeah.

Well, are you having fun out there?

Fun?

There's no point if you're not

having fun. Right?

Yeah. I guess so.

You guess so...? Are you on

medication, Jarrett? Tranquilizers?

Anything?

No. No, sir.

Did I ask you if they gave you

shock out there?

Yeah.

Yeah what?

Yeah. You asked me. Yeah, they did.

Don't look at us, Lazenby! Get your

ass in the water! Look at the

bottom of the pool! You know, I'm

no doctor, Jarrett. I would never

have let them put electricity in my

head.

God that Salan! He's such a picky

bastard! He drives me nuts!

Everybody drives you nuts.

Don and Fenetch look good, don't

you think, Jarrett?

They look very good.

Hey, Con, is he giving you a hard

time?

He gives everybody a hard time,

Dickie.

You guys don't want a clarinet, do

you?

Yeah, Van Buren wants a clarinet.

I don't need a clarinet. Who's

selling it?

My brother. He needs a motorcycle.

Uh, uh... I need a new pair of

shoes.

You need a new personality.

You, you stand behind me in the

choir.

Oh? I do? You do? Is that you?

You have a lot of energy.

I do?

Yeah. I mean, That's good. My

name's Jeannine Pratt.

Nice. Hi!

You're Conrad Jarrett, remember?

Right. Hum. Yeah. Um. Bye.

Bye-bye.

"You've got a lot of energy."

Trick or treat!

You're the scariest ghost I've ever

seen! And the tiger and the witch...

You all look just wonderful. Take

an apple.

Thank you.

There you go. Be careful.

Thank you Mrs Jarrett, bye.

Good-bye.

The Cabbots. Little Julie's first

time. God, she's so cute!

Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

Know what I've been thinking?

Mmm?

That Christmas in London would be

like something out of Dickens.

We've never done that before,

right? Christmas in London?

Maybe we shouldn't plan to go away

right now.

Yes, we talked about that.   We

decided on that.

Yeah. I know we talked about it,

but the more I talk about it, the

more the timing doesn't seem right.

Calvin, we've always gone away at

Christmas time.

I know.

I think...  I think it would be good

for him too. Isn't it time we got

back to normal?

He's just started with this doctor.

Alright, so he'll miss three weeks.

Why interrupt it?

Because I want to get away! I think

we all should. It's important.

No. If he doesn't go through with

this now, he might change his mind.

Alright then if he changes his

mind, maybe it's not something that

was right for him to do.

You talked to him about it? Does he

want to go to London?

I don't think he knows what he

wants to do.

HA!

Oh, I'm sorry.

Don't do that!

I'm sorry, I...

Ha. I didn't think you were here

I'm sorry, I just got in. I didn't...

I didn't know you were here.

I didn't play golf, today. It's too

cold.

How's your golf game?

I didn't play.

Oh...   It did get colder today.

No, I mean, ...for the year it's

colder.

Yeah.

Weren't you swimming today?

Uh-huh. Sorry I scared you.

How'd it go?

Good. I swam well, today.

Good.

Yeah.

Personaly I think I could swim

the 50 if my timing got...

Off.

...my timing got better.

I'm a just a little...   a little

off with my... my timing.

Well, you have to work at that.

Yeah. Oh, I got seventy four on a

trig quiz.

Seventy four? Gee, I was awful at

trig.

Oh? Did you...? You took Trig?

Wait a minute... Did I take trig?

That's... - uh...? I bought you two

shirts. They're on your bed.

Who's gonna be there?

Well. The Murrays of course, and

the Gunthers, and the Caines, and...

the good old us.

Why don't we just go to the movies

instead?

Don't be negative.

That's not negative. That's

unpredictable.

Come on. Let's really go to the

movies.

Okay.

Really?

Okay. Yeah. Come on. Let's go.

What's our excuse?

Beth wanted to go to the movies?

Good. Very good.

All right now, smile.

Hello Gladyce. Will you put that

with the rest of them?

Oh, look, we're in time for the

grand entrance!

Hello! Look who's here! Three

blocks away and the last to arrive.

Come on in.

Clark! Happy birthday! You look

wonderful for a 75-year-old!

Is that new?

Yes. It is. Do you like it?

You did the mousse?

It turned out well?

Hey. Partner. How are you?

Hey, pal!

Hi there.

Hi. Beth.

Good to see you, and where were you

at the lunch last week?

Call your bank and borrow the

money.

I was thinking of going public.

I wouldn't do that,      I wouldn't

do it now...

Why not?

...because the market's low.

Your hair looks wonderful. It's

shorter, isn't it? I like that.

I said: "Would you please put out

your cigar?" and he says: "Huh?". I

said: "Would you put out your

cigar?", he says: "Huh?". I said:

"Would you please put out your

cigar?", he says: " I don't have

another one!"

Good to see you! You look

beautiful. As ever.

It's a macho factor. When these

kids are at school, they just think

they've got to walk on the edge of

danger.

What are these hushed tones all

about?

He just told the funniest joke!

I'm not talking to you.

Why?

Obviously, you know, I have my

fingers crossed on this merger.

When can we have lunch?

Great. Fill me in the office, I

have no idea of my schedule, but

I'm free almost everyday.

I ran into Billy white. Bob Mc

Lean's leaving Coles and Johnson.

Where is he going?

He doesn't know.

Jesus.

No. You didn't. You're so mean.

Isn't he the meanest man you've

met?

When a ball is in play, if a

player, his partner, their

equipment or their caddies

accidentally move it...

He's a jolly good fellow

For he's a jolly good fellow

Won't regret, can't forget

What we did for love

Hi. Annie. What's your boy up to

these days?

Oh. Who knows? They won't tell.

How's Conrad doing?

He's great. Just great.

I asked Donald, and he says they

haven't talked much. I said maybe

he's a little self-conscious.

Oh!

No, no. No. No. He's...

There's a doctor in Highland

Park... that he sees a couple of

times a week. That kinda cuts into

his social life.

He's great. Just great.

Really? Is he still having some

problems?

Oh, no, no. Nothing like that. No,

no, just somebody to talk to...

that's all. Kind of polish off the

rough edges, that's all.

How are you. Darling? Is he falling

asleep on you, yet?

Nah. He's great.

Mr. Great. That's me!

Hey?

You drink too much at parties,

Calvin.

I'm not drunk.

Why did you tell Annie Marshall

that Conrad is seeing a

psychiatrist?

I dunno. Why not?

Well for one thing, I don't think

people hear that kind of thing very

easily.

Come on, for most people, it's a

status symbol, right up there with

going to Europe.

Well, I thought your blurting it

out like that was in very bad

taste...

I did not think it was that...

Not to mention a violation of

privacy!

Whose privacy?

Our privacy! The family's privacy!

I think it is a very private

matter.

So what do I do... tell you my

dreams?

I don't hold much stock in dreams.

What kind of a psychiatrist are

you? They all believe in dreams.

Really? What's happening?

What's going on?

I just feel... I feel so...

What?

Jumpy. I don't know.

Look. Kiddo... I lied. I do

believe in dreams. Only sometimes I

want to know what's happening when

you're awake. Come on, something's

bugging you, making you nervous.

You're making me nervous.

Maybe I need a tranquilizer.

Tranquilizer?

Yeah.

I think you came in here looking

like something out of The Body

Snatchers. It's not my impression

that you need a tranquilizer.

What is this?

Clock.

Oh, I see. So you get to tell the

time, but I can't. Is that it?

Mmm, mmm.

So you know when the hour's up?

Right.

Fifty minutes, fifty five minutes?

What is it?

Maybe... Maybe I don't want to swim

anymore. You know, I mean my timing

is for shit. You know, he's got two

guys that swim the fifty, they're

better than me, and...

Ha, ha.

They're a bunch of boring ass

jocks.

Ha, ha.

And him... I can't stand him. He's

a tight ass son of a bitch!

Ah, ah?... Have you ever thought

about quitting?

Are you telling me to?

No.

It wouldn't look good.

Forget about how it looks! How does

it feel?

How does it feel? How does it feel?

Yes!

How does it feel?!

Yes! How does it feel?

It's the same thing that happened

last year... It's the same damn

thing I did last year.

Are you the same person you were

last year?

I don't know!

That's why you need a tranquilizer?

You tell me!

No. It's up to you!

Fifty bucks an hour, can't you

decide if I should have a pill or

not? I mean, you're a doctor, I'm

supposed to feel better! Right?

Not necessarily.

How is it with your friends? Is it

getting any easier?

No. It's still hard.

Is anyplace easy?

The hospital was.

It was? Why?

Because nobody hid anything there.

Was there anyone there you could

talk to?

Uh-huh.

I mean, besides Dr. Crawford?

Uh-huh.

Whoa!

Hi!

Hey, Karen! Hi! How are you?

Good. Real good.

Sit down. Please.

Thank you.

Wow.

When did you get back?

Uh... The end of August.

God...

It's great to see you.

Oh, you too. Listen. I am not gonna

be able to stay a real long time.

I've got a meeting over at school.

Drama Club meeting. We're doing "A

Thousand Clowns" this year. You

know it? Anyway. We're going so

crazy trying to get it together.

I am secretary this year too.

Don't let me hang you up.

No. Oh, no, you're not hanging me

up! No, I really wanted to see you.

I didn't know quite what to

expect, though... I mean, you

sounded...uh, you sounded sort of

funny on the phone.

No, no, I wasn't. It was just a

gray day, that's all. Kind of...

But everything's great, I'm back

in school, I am on the swim team,

and...

Oh. You're swimming? Terrific,

Conrad! That's... That's really

wonderful.

We haven't had any meets yet. I

could end up on the bench all year,

but...

Come on, you'll do great. I'll bet

your folks are real proud of you.

Yeah, yeah.

What can I get you guys?

You're hungry, at all?

Uh... I just want a coke.

Uh...   two cokes, please.

You think we offended him?

Something I said? Definitely a low

self-image day.

So. Uh...

You really look beautiful.

So do you.

Do you miss it?

Miss what?

The hospital.

No.

Thank you.

You don't miss it? At all? Nothing?

Nothing about it?

No.

You don't miss Leo's corny jokes?

Are you seeing a doctor?

Yeah. I'm seeing a doctor. Are you?

Uh... Uh, well, Dr. Crawford gave me

a name, and I went for a while. But

uh... I dunno.It just didn't work

for me, I guess. He just kept

telling me all the things I already

knew, and , uh... finally, I

decided... the only one who can

help me is myself. At least, that's

what my dad says.

I don't mean it's not right for

you, Conrad. I mean I think that

if it's something you want to do,

that's what you should be doing.

Well, ya, I don't know how long

I'll keep it up. I sorta got shoved

into it.

Your hair grew in.

Oh, yes. That was such a dumb thing

to do.

I like it.

You do?

Yeah!

I don't know, I just... Uh...

I miss it sometimes, the

hospital.

Really do.

Things have to change. You know?

But that's where we had the laughs.

But that was a hospital. This is

the real world.

Yeah, yeah, I... you're sure right.

I really have to go. I'm sorry. I

have a meeting over at the school.

Drama Club meeting. We're doing "A

Thousand Clowns".

I know, you told me.

Did I?

Yeah.

I better hurry. Don't wanna be

late.

Thanks for seeing me.

Conrad? Let's have a great

Christmas! Okay? Let's have... a

great year. Let's have the best

year of our whole lives, OK? We

can, you know. This could be the

best year ever.

Yeah... Yeah.

Yeah!

Mmm...   Will you call me?

Yeah...

You mean it?

Yep!

You. Uh... You look good. Conrad.

Yeah.

Bye.

Bye-bye.

Hey!

Would you cheer up?

It's cold out here. You should put

that on, or do you want a sweater?

Do I need one?

What are you doing?

Nothing. Thinking.

About what?

Not about anything.

Your hair is starting to grow out.

It's looking... looking better.

I was thinking about the pigeon...

You know the one that used to hang

around the garage. How it used to

get on top of your car, and he take

off when you pulled out of the

driveway.

Oh. Yeah, I remember. I remember

how scared I used to get... That

whosssshhhhh! Flap, flap, flap,

flap!... Every time I started the

car.

Yeah. That was the closest we ever

came to having a pet. You remember

Buck asked you, he tried to talk

you into... getting a dog. Do you

remember that?

He said. "How about it, if it's

the size of a little football?"

You know. Uh... That animal next

door, that Pepper or Pippin,

whatever its name is...

Pippin. Pippin. Pippin!

He's not a very friendly dog...    I...

I don't care what Mr. McGreary

says.

Arf! Arf! Arf!

Put that on if you're gonna stay

out here, okay?

Can I help?

Help what? Oh, you mean with this?

No.

I will.

No, I tell you what you can do

though. You can go upstairs to that

room of yours and clean out the

closet.

Mom...

Okay? Because it really is a mess.

Hello. /.../

Oh, hi! /.../

Yeah, , no, I didn't get there. I

was swamped with work. How did it

go? /.../

No, no, I'm not doing anything,

just getting ready for dinner.

Uh-huh.

Did she really?

Oh anyway, Mary Ann Ramon started

to just scream, just cry, right?

It was crazy. We got so drunk

that we couldn't talk to each

other. It was the last day... the

last day of school.

We walked out of the building in

the middle of the class!

Oh, Bucky!

No. Stop!

What do you expect from her?

We just don't connect.

Why not?

I don't know. We just don't.

What are you thinking?

That I jack off a lot.

So what else is new? Does it help?

For a minute.

What now?

John Boy.

Who?

You know, in "The Waltons". John

Boy?

Yeah. What about him?

My father came into my room and he

didn't know what to say.

This is right after Buck died.

And he came over and sat on the

bed next to me, put his arm

around my shoulder. We just sat

there.

I remember I was watching his

shoe.

And thinking...

Cos his shoe was turned over on

its side.

I was thinking: "He's so uptight,

it's gonna crack off."

And I knew I should have felt

something.

But I didn't know what to feel.

I kept thinking what they say on

TV, you know, stuff like:

"Oh, no, noo! Ooh, My god!"

But I didn't say that... because

I didn't feel sad...

so much as...

So much as what?

I dunno. I kept thinking that John

Boy would've said something...about

the way he felt, you know.

Something.

What would John Boy have said?

I don't know.

Come on.

Come on.

Come on what?

Don't hold back.

Well. At least she's an

improvement. She doesn't crack gum

in your face. That's what you get

when your partner does the hiring

and firing.

Oh, I'm sorry. That's my fault.

I just can never seem to tell

anybody that they're not making

it.

Hold, hold it. Wait a minute.

That's not the problem.

Where are you?

What?

I've been losing you these days.

Oh, I'm sorry.

That's okay. That's okay. You off

the track?

Huh?

Come on. I've known you for twenty

years. You think I can't tell when

something's wrong? How's Connie?

Connie's all right. He is. He's

okay.

Look, I am sorry, it's none of my

business, but I think you worry too

much. You've been on the rack about

him long enough. You're making it a

habit. You've gotta let him go

sometime.

I'm not on the rack about him.

The thing about it is, in a year

he'll be gone. Off to Michigan or

Harvard or wherever in the hell he

gets it in his head he wants to go.

Maybe he'll decide to take a tour

of Europe for a year and not even

go to school at all. Who knows?

I can't argue with "Who knows."

I'm just try giving you the benefit

of my experience.

Thanks.

With Valerie, it's more than her

living away from home... She's

gone. Got her own friends, her own

life. She breezes in ...for a couple

of days on vacations, but... I don't

know, maybe girls are different.

Or maybe she was too aware of what

was happening between Nance and me.

But they leave... And all that

worrying doesn't amount to a hill

of crap. It's just wasted energy.

Give me back my sweater! Come on,

it's my sweater!

Possession is nine tenths...

Hang on!

Dad, what's possession?

Give it to me!

I can't, it's already on me.

Wait, hang on! Whose sweater is it?

It's my sweater!

OK! Alright! I'll give it back to

you... as long as you give me back

my hockey stick and my skis.

All right.

That's fair!

Conrad! Conrad!

What is it?

Watch your back. Cuts are vertical.

He really meant business.

Let's go.

Lake Forest is next. Lake Forest.

I'm not taking you back again.

You'll remember that?

I won't ask you to    ...sir.

What happened? You all right?

Yeah.

Salan says you quit the swim

team.

Yeah.

Why?

I don't know. I felt like it was a

bore.

That's not a real reason!

Well, that's the way it is.

So what's going on?

Nothing.

What happened?

Nothing.

Connie, come on, talk to me.

Nothing. Swimming's a bore. That's

all.

Well listen, I talked to Salan...

Well, quit talking to people! Okay?

Holy shit!     Yeah. Sure. Fuck you.

Jarrett.

Ooh! Ohh!

Shut up. Leave it alone.

I told you. The guy's a flake.

So, what did your dad say about it?

I haven't told him yet.

How come?

I don't know. The timing isn't

right, you know. He sweats

everything so much, he'll just get

worried about it.

Can you tell your mother?

My mother? My mother and I don't

connect. Don't you listen? I told

you that.

What do people have in common with

mothers anyway? It's all surface

junk. You know: "Clean your room,

brush your teeth, get good grades,

nah, nah, nah, veh..."

Hey, look, I'm just wasting money

today. I am not gonna feel

anything. I'm sorry.

No. Sorry's out. Come on,

something's on your mind.

What time is it?

No, no, never mind the time.

There's time. Look. Remember the

contract? Control? Maybe there's

some connection between control and

uh...  what do we call it? - lack

of feeling? Mmm?

I said I feel things.

When?

Ah, God... Come on.

When?

Sometimes. I don't know.

Come on, come on, Jarrett, I

thought you didn't like to fool

around.

I don't? I'm not.

Like to play games, do you?

I don't!

So?

What do you want?

I'll tell you what I want. I want

you to leave "I don't know" out

there on the table with the

magazines. Okay?

Yeah, and if I don't have an answer

you want me to make one up?

Yeah. That would be nice. Make one

up. Right now. About how there's no

feelings in there.

I said I have feelings.

Oh! Now you have, now you don't!

Get it together, Jarrett.

Why you hassle me? Why are you

trying to make me mad?

Are you mad?

No!

Oh, cut the shit! You're mad!

You're mad as hell! You don't like

being pushed.

So why don't you do something

about it!

What?

Tell me to fuck off! I don't know.

Well, fuck off! No. No, I can't, I

can't do this.

Why not?

I can't...

Why not?

I can't do this. It takes too much

energy to get mad!

Do you know how much energy it

takes to hold it back?

When I let myself feel low, I feel

as lousy.

Oh! I beg your pardon! I never

promised you a rose garden...

Fuck you. Berger!

What?

Fuck you.

Yeah?

Fuck you!

That's it!

Jesus, you're really weird! What

about you? What do you feel, huh?

Do you jack off or jerk off?

Whatever you call it?

What do you think?

What do I think? I think you

married your fat lady... and you

goona over fuck the daylights out

of her!

Sounds good to me.

Ah! Ha!   Ha...

A little advice about feeling,

kiddo... Don't expect it always to

tickle.

Oh, all right, all right.

And be quiet. Be quiet. Be quiet.

Conrad. Where are you?

Connie!

Connie.

Over in the middle between your

mother and father.

That's good.

That's great. All right, smile

everybody.

Ohhh!

Connie. I want one of Connie and

his mother.

No, I tell you what. Let's get the

three men in there, and I'll take a

picture of you.

Connie, move in a little closer to

your mother. Okay... prize

winner...

Yeah. That's great.

Portrait...

It's great.

Do it.

Page one, Lake Forrester...

Shoot, I didn't cock it.

Calvin...

Hold it. Connie, smile!

Calvin!

Just a second, smile!

Calvin, give me the camera.

No, I didn't get it yet , Beth.

Come on, give me the camera.

Dad, give her the camera.

I want a really good picture of the

two of you, OK?

No but I really want a shot of the

three of you men. Give me the

camera, Calvin. Please...

Not until I get a picture of the

two of you.

Cal?

GIVE-HER-THE-GODDAMN-CAMERA!

Smile.

Who's hungry? I'll make the

sandwiches.

Beth?!

I think it can be saved.

That was dumb. It was just so dumb.

I don't think he's happy in school.

Have you talked to his teachers?

I don't think people want to be

with him. He provokes people.

Well. / Why don't you do this? /

It's an awkward age.

Thank you.

Maybe he needs a change. Are you

sure he's eating enough?

Yes, Mother, of course.

I think he'll be all right - if

you're firm with him, mmm?

I think maybe he should go away to

school. I just don't know how to

deal with him any more.

Who would make that decision?

I don't know. I suppose this doctor

he's seeing.

What sort of doctor... would make

that decision for you?

A psychiatrist.

I thought we were all finished with

that.

No...

What's his name?

Berger.

Jewish doctor?

I dunno, I suppose he's Jewish.

Maybe just German.

What does Cal say about all this?

You know, I think this can be

saved. It's a nice clean break.

Alleluia, Amen. Amen. Alleluia,

Amen. Aaaaaamen.

Okay. Altos, that last "E" natural

could be just a little higher.

Officers, don't forget your

meeting tonight. That's it.

Mmm mm mmm, Mmm mm mmm, Mmm mmm

Mmm mm mmm.

Hi. Jeannine!

You are really a terrific tenor.

Oh...

In fact. You should be doing the

solo in that Russian thing.

Ha, no. I...

No. I'm serious. You really sing

well. I'm getting to know your

voice.

Yeah?

Yeah!

How can you hear me sing if you're

singing?

Well... I don't always sing.

Sometimes I just listen.

Oh?

For instance, Marcia Blair can't

sing a note.

Uh, uh...

Janet Fox only mouths the words and

never sings.

Ha, ha?   Ha, a detective?

Yeah...

Do you like Vivaldi?

Uh...

Telemann?

Telemann? Um...

What kind of music do you like?

Oh. Uh... Modern jazz. I like. Folk

rock. Spoon on a glass.

Spoon on a ...glass?

Oh, you mean like ...tablespoon?

Oh, dear! Why do I ask dumb

questions? I'm just showing off.

Why is it so hard... the first

time you talk to somebody?

Mmmm. You make it look easy.

Really?

Oh, that's my bus, I got to go!

I'll see you later!

And you're really a terrific

tenor!

Ah. You're just saying that?

Alleluia!    Alleluia!

Alleluia!

Hello?

Hello. Is Karen there?

Who's calling, please?

It's a friend of hers from

Hillsboro?

Oh... Well, she's ...not home from

school yet.

Oh. Um...Hmm. Just tell her I

called. This is Conrad. Calling.

Just tell her I called and I'm

feeling great, and I just wanted

to talk to her.

Yes. I will.

OK. Thank you.

Good bye.

All right

Hello?

Hello. This is... Hello, this is

Conrad calling. Jarrett?

Oh...

Oh. Hi!

Hi. Listen. I was... I was

wondering if maybe you'd like...to

go out sometime?

You mean, with you? Like on a date?

Well, yeah, we wouldn't have to

call it a real date. We could fake

it sort of, to see how it goes..

That was dumb. Forget it. Just

forget it. Now start over.

Hi, this is Conrad Jarrett...

I'd love to. When?

I didn't see you there. What do you

think?

Fine.

Rawlins used to have such great

Scotch pines. And they all look

like skeletons this year.

Hi. What do you think?

Very nice.

What's wrong?

Why don't you ask him what's wrong?

Maybe you won't have to hear it

from Carol Lazenby.

Hear what?

Dad, I quit the swim team.

What?

Carol thought I knew. Cos why

wouldn't I? It happened over a

month ago.

Quit? When? Where have you been

every night?

Nowhere. Around. The library

mostly.

Why didn't you tell us, Connie?

I don't know, I didn't think it

mattered.

What do you mean? Why wouldn't it

matter? Of course it matters.

And...

No, that was meant for me, Calvin.

What was meant for you?

It's really important to try to

hurt me. Isn't it?

Don't you have that backwards?

Oh? And how do I hurt you? By

embarrassing you in front of a

friend? Poor Beth! She has no idea

what her son is up to! He lies and

she believes every word of it.

I didn't lie!

You did! You lied everytime you

came into this house at 6:30 !

If it's starting all over again,

the lying, the covering up, the

disappearing for hours, I will

not stand for it! I can't stand

it! I really can't!

Well don't then! Go to Europe!

Connie! Now, Connie! Connie!...

Cos the only reason she cares, the

only reason she gives a fuck about

it...

Connie!...

...is because someone else knew about

it first!

Just stop it, Connie! ...

No! You tell her to stop it! You

never tell her a godamn thing!

And I know why she never came to

the hospital, she's busy going to

goddamn Spain and... goddamn

Portugal! Why should she care if

I'm hung up by the balls out

there?

Maybe this is how they sit around

and talk at the hospital, but we're

not at the hospital now.

You never came to the hospital!

How   do you know she never came?

You   know she came but she had the

flu   and couldn't come inside, but

she   came.

Yeah! She wouldn't have had any flu

if Buck was in the hospital!

She would have come if Buck was

in the hospital!

Buck never would've been in the

hospital!

That's enough! That is enough!

I won't do it again. I really won't

do it.

What in hell has happened?

Somebody better go up there.

Ah! Oh, god, that's the pattern,

isn't it? He walks all over us and

then you go up and apologize to

him.

I am not going to apologize...

Yes of course you are! You always

do! You've been apologizing to him

ever since he got home from the

hospital, only you don't see it!

I am not apologizing. I'm trying to

goddamn understand him!

Don't talk to me that way. Don't

you talk to me the way he talks to

you!

Beth. Let's not fight. Okay? No

fighting. Okay? Please. Let's go

upstairs.

I want to talk to you.

I need to sleep.

In a minute...

I didn't mean it. I didn't mean any

of it. I am sorry. Please don't be

mad.

I'm not mad ! I'm just trying to

figure out what happened down

there.

I don't know what happened! I am

sorry about it all. I am sorry

about the whole thing. What I

said, I didn't mean it. Just please

tell her. Tell her I'm sorry, will

you?

Why don't you tell her?

Oh, God, no, I can't! Don't you

see? I can't talk to her!

Why not?

Ha! Because it doesn't change

anything. It doesn't change the way

she looks at me.

She was upset, Conrad. Your mother

was hurt because you quit the swim

team. I don't understand it myself.

I don't mean just now. Don't you

see? I don't mean just today.

What then? Explain it to me.

Ha! I can't! Everything is German

pudding with you , dad. You don't

see things!

What things?

What things? Please, I want you to

tell me.

That she hates me! Can't you see

that?

Your mother doesn't hate you,

Conrad?

All right, all right. You're right.

She doesn't. Please leave me alone,

now.

What about this Dr. Berger? Do you

think he's helping you?

Don't blame it on Burger, it's not

his fault!

I'll be downstairs if you need me.

Tuesday you felt great. You bought

a Christmas tree, it was all hunky-

dory. Okay?

You're the doctor.

Don't take refuge in one-liners

like "You're the doctor". Okay?

Because that pisses me off.

Okay. Okay.

So everything was fine till you had

the fight with your mother, then

everything was lousy.

Yeah, but I don't blame her. I

mean, she's got... She's got her

reasons. It's impossible after all

the shit I've pulled!

What shit have you pulled? Hey!

Remember! I'm talking proportion

here. Now, what shit?

Come on. You must be able to come

up with at least one example.

And don't give me "I tried to

kill myself", that's old turkey.

What have you done lately?

Lately?

Uh, uh.

Hey, come on, if you... Listen,

I'm never gonna be forgiven for

that. Never! You know, you can't

get it out, you know, all the blood

in her towels, in her rug.

Everything had to be pitched.

Even the tiles in the bathroom

had to be regrouted. Christ, she

fired the godamn maid because she

couldn't dust the living room

right. If you think I'm gonna

forgive... - that she's gonna

forgive me...

What?

I think I just figured something

out.

What?

Who it is who can't forgive who...

Well a real problem... a real

problem has a real solution.

I've heard this all before.

Doesn't make it any less true.

I'm so tired.

Yeah, well... that's a hell of a

secret you've been keeping on

yourself.

So what do I do now?

Recognize her limitations.

You mean, like she can't love me?

Oh, kiddo, no. Like she can't love

you enough. Like don't blame her

for not loving you more than she's

able.

But she loves my father. I know she

loved my brother. It's me!

Ha! Now we're back to the rotten

kid routine! She can't love you

because you're unlovable. Where

does that leave your dad? How come

he loves you? You're a rottenkid,

doesn't he know that?

That's different. He feels

responsible. Besides, he loves

everybody.

Ho, I get it! The guy's got no

taste! He loves you, but he's

wrong.

Look... maybe she just can't

express it the way you'd like her

to. Maybe she's just afraid to

show you what she feels.

What do you mean?

I mean there's someone besides your

mother you've got to forgive.

You mean me?

For trying to off myself?

Don't you sit there and stare at

me. What for?

Why don't you give yourself a

break? Let yourself off the hook?

What did I do?

What did I do?

We'll talk about it on Thursday.

Come on!

Time's up.

What do you mean? You're gonna pull

the plug... Come on! What did I do?

Come on, Con. You know the rules.

Rules? What rules? Can't I have a

few minutes?

You think about it. Just think

about it.

Jesus!

Say. After going to a new high, it

falls to 112 1/4 and then rallies

on good volume. I shoot an order to

buy 4000 at the market. If I get

the 4000 shares at 113 3/4, I know

something's wrong.

But suppose the order to buy the

4000 shares I put in at the price

of 113 3/4, I get 2000 at 114, 500

at 114 1/4, and the rest on the way

up, so the last 500 shares I pay

115 1/2, then I know I'm right.I'm

going to peel off here.

OK.

I'll see you, Cal.

See you later.

Suppose the order to buy 4000 at

113 3/4...

He walks all over us and you go up

there and apologize to him...

500 at 114...

It's all German pudding with you,

dad, you don't see things.

You've been apologizing to him ever

since he came home from the

hospital. And you just don't see

that!

Tell her to stop it! You never tell

her a godamn thing!

Buck never would have been in the

hospital!

She hates me! Can't you see that?

I want to be clear.

That's good.

In the car, I was thinking: "be

clear.". I suppose that's what

psychiatry's about. Being precise

and clear. And honest, of course.

I'll level with you. I'm not a

great believer in psychiatry.

Okay.

I know what happens here is only

between you and him, and...I like

that, I respect that.

And...he's better, I can see

that. I am not trying to put you

down, I just don't believe in

psychiatry as a panacea for

everybody.

Neither do I.

I wish I knew what the hell I was

doing here.

Well, you said you... thought you

could shed some light on some

things. What did you mean by that?

I don't know actually, I'm not

sure, I think I meant in terms of

Conrad. You see, I knew something

was wrong even before he tried

to... to kill himself. But I

thought that... It's clear that

he's very smart. He's been an "A"

student ever since he started

school, and naturally I thought

that ...intelligent people could

work out their own problems.

But you still feel responsible?

Yeah, sure I do. It's hard not to.

It was luck. It was just luck

that I happened to be there when

he tried it. I could have been at

a meeting. We both could've been

away. It was luck!

You think of yourself as a lucky

man, then?

No! No. No. I used to. I used to

think... that I was a lucky person...

before... the "accident".

Mmm, I guess the whole of life is

nothing but an accident, is it?

What happens to you. I should do

with it.

That sounds more like the

philosophy of a drifter than a tax

attorney.

Yeah. Maybe, maybe I am drifting a

little. I can see myself, ...and I

can see the two of them drifting

away from me, and I just stand

there watching.

What would you want to do about

that?

Something. I gotta do something

about it. I don't know what.

I feel like I'm sitting on a fence,

and I don't like it.

And you see them as on ...opposite

sides of this fence?

Yeah... No. I don't know. I see her

not being able to forgive him.

For what?

Oh, I don't know exactly. Being too

much like her. People always think

that she and Buck are... were

...were alike. But it's really she

and Conrad. They were the only two

that didn't cry at the funeral, you

know? It's not easy for me to admit

this but, uh... she didn't...

His mother doesn't show him a

great deal of affection. I'm not

trying to put her down in any way

at all. She is a wonderful woman,

huh...

Did she give Buck much affection to

...Buck?

Oh, god, yes, she loved Buck!

Bucky got so much... I think what

she felt for him was special. You

know, he was her first-born.

That's not unusual, is it?

And you?

Me?    I   loved Buck.

What I mean is, your wife's

affection.

For me you mean?

Yes.

Mmm. She's very... No. There's no

problem with her for me. We've

been... We've been married nearly

twenty one years. Everybody loves

Beth. But, huh... for Conrad, -

it's been difficult. He didn't talk

about that? We don't know what

happens here. It doesn't come up. I

guess that's what it is. It's

private here. Isn't it?

Mm-hmm.   Very private.

I think I know why I came here. I

think I came here to talk about

myself.

Okay. Why don't we?

Hi!

Calvin?

What's the matter?

This will sound strange.

What happened?

Could we talk about Buck's funeral?

What?

I know it'll seem trivial, but it's

on my mind, or has been, and I'd

just like to talk about it.

Why?

When I was getting dressed for

Buck's funeral, I was...

Calvin, what's the matter with you?

Just let me get it off my chest,OK?

What could getting dressed for

Buck's funeral possibly have to do

with anything right now?

I was wearing a blue shirt. And

you said: - Wear a white shirt and

the other shoes!

It was nothing at the time. But

it's always seemed to stay with

me. And I, for some reason, been

thinking about it and it suddenly

occured to me what difference did

it make what I wore at Buck's

funeral?

Ha, ha.

Just hear me out, Beth! It won't

hurt you to listen!

I won't listen to that! No one in

their right mind would listen to

that.

I just want to talk about something

I always remembered.

Why do you want to remind me of it?

Because I've always wondered, in

some needling way, what it mattered

what I wore. I was crazy that day.

We were going to our son's funeral.

And you were worried about what I

wore on my feet. I'm sure it

sounds like nothing to you, but

it sticks with me and I just

wanted to ...tell you about it.

It's all right.

Beth! Beth! Hi! How are you?

Caroll! I'm fine. How are you?

I haven't seen you!

I know. I'm so busy. I promise I'll

call you soon and we'll have lunch.

Right!

How's Brad? Give him my love.

Fabulous! Is everything okay?

Isn't this madness?   It gets worse

every year!

Good-bye!

May I show you this in your size?

What?

May I show you this dress in your

size?

Oh... No, no. No. Thanks.

We've got Bennett's, and Grant's

and Foley's. Ha, Conrad should get

something for my mother and father.

He's not supposed to get

something for his doctor, is he?

I don't think so. I think we should

go see him, Beth. - Dr. Berger.

What?

I think we could all go and see him

together.

Why?

He thinks it's a good idea.

Ho... He thinks it's a good idea?

What does he know about me, about

this family? I've never even met

him.

Exactly. That's the point.

Wouldn't it be easier if we all

talked about it? In the open.

About what? What are we gonna talk

about? Don't try to change me,

Calvin. I don't want anymore

changes in my life. For God's sake,

hasn't enough happened? Let's just

hold on to what we've got!

Darling, that is what this is for.

Maybe you'll get a surprise.

I don't want any surprises.

I know I'm not perfect. And if I

can't go around hugging everybody

all the time the way you do, then

I'm sorry.

I am not asking you to be perfect,

you're missing the point.

I don't want to see any doctors or

counselors. I am me. This is my

family. And if we have problems,

then we will solve those problems

in the privacy of our own home, not

by running to some kind of

specialist everytime something goes

wrong...

Are you folks ready to order?

Huh, no... Could you give me a

couple of minutes, please?

Sure.

...running to experts every time

something goes wrong.

I know you mean well. I want this

to be a nice Christmas.

I do too. I want all of them to be

nice Christmases

We need time together, Calvin. You

and I. We have to get away. New

Years'. We can spend some time in

Houston with my brother and Audrey.

You know, play a little golf.

Relax.

I have already talked to Mother

about it, and Conrad can stay with

them. Please don't worry about it.

Please, for his sake, don't indulge

him. We need time together. Okay?

Okay.   Okay.

I love you.

I love you, too.

Let's just give things time. Okay?

Conrad?

Hmm?

I don't bowl. I mean, I'm a

horrible bowler.

Oh, that's all right.

Yeah. Well...

I got it. That's OK. Thing is,

I'm a funny bowler.

Well, listen. We don't have to go

bowling if you'd rather not, I'm

not a bowling nut or anything. How

funny are you?

On a scale from one to ten?   ...

About a ten.

Hoo, that's pretty funny. Hey,

well, listen, I promise you won't

look silly.

Guarantee it?

Guarantee it.

Can you ever break the ball?

Can't break the ball, can't break

the floor, can't break anything in

a bowling alley. And that's what I

like about bowling alleys. Can't

even break the record.

Anyway...

Hmm? What?

Just "anyway", it's a conversation

starter.

Catchy!

You like it?

Mmm, mmm.

I thought it'd get to you. I've

been working on it all day.

Do you think people are punished

for the things they do?

You mean by God?

Yeah.

Mmm, I don't believe in God.

Not at all?

No. Well, it's not a question of

degree. Either you do or you don't.

I believe in God.

So you're afraid he'll punish you

for something you did?

I've done a lot of things I'm

ashamed of.

Yeah? So have I.

Did it hurt?

No, I dunno, I don't remember

really.

You don't want to talk about it?

Ah, I don't know... I've never

really talked about it.

To doctors, but not to anyone else.

You're the first who's asked.

Why did you do it?

Uh... I don't know. It was like...

falling into a hole.

It was like falling into a hole,

and it keeps getting bigger and

bigger, .and you can't get out,

and then, .all of a sudden, it's

inside...and you're the hole, and

you're trapped, and it's all

over. Something like that. And

it's not really scary, except it

is when you think back on it.

'Cause you know what you were

feeling stange and new...

Like McDonald's can, nobody can

do it. Like McDonald's can, you

deserve a break today. So get up

and get away!

Hey. Jarrett. How you doing? How

about some fries?

What are you doing?

Hey, what's your problem? Lighten

up!

Hey. I don't like your attitude.

Energetic. Those guys.

Yeah, they were pretty funny.

No...

What? You thought they were funny?

No. I...

I'm sorry, I...

What for?

Anyway...

Do you want to talk?

About what?

Are you okay?

Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Uh... I'll

give you a call.

Will you? I want you to.

Sure.

Well...   Guess I'll see you in

choir.

Okay. Yeah. Thanks.

Okay.

I mean. Good night. Good night.

Good night.

Seven.

Yes... It's not even plugged in.

In preparation for our landing in

Houston, observe the fasten seat

belt sign......

......and please no smoking until well

inside the terminal. Thank you.

Watch this. Pessimistic golfer.

Pessimistic golfer.

Oh. Damn!

Are we two up? Two?

Two!

All right. Let's hustle up. We're

close here.

I'll never get over how flat it is

here. I'll never get over...

I know it's flat, but we decided to

teach you to love it.

He is trying to get everybody to

move down here.

Really?

Gosh, you guys, it's so good to see

you. You look tired. Cal.

Airplane scotch.

Would you tell me why it is I am

still hungry?

'Cause you're in Texas, girl.

When we get done, we'll get you

home. Get ya some steaks on the

barbecue. Audrey will put

together her famous salad.

With baked potatoe and sour cream,

too, uh? How long has he had that

drawl?

Ever since we joined the country

club.

I am glad you can laugh about it,

cos' it sure as hell wasn't

funny.

Come on, we weren't that bad.

Let's face it, we stunk.

I don't know how you can listen

to that lecture on Buck Jarrett

one more time.

I know he is the world's greatest

swimmer, but it bugs the hell

outa me when he does that.

Stillman, cut it.

Think he's ever gonna stop kissing

the guy's picture?

Stillman, shut the hell up, would

you? Hey, con, you want a ride?

Oh. No. Thanks.

We sure could've used you today,

buddy.

Oh, no, I don't think so.

Yeah... I don't think anybody

could've helped us today.

How's it going, Jarrett? I hear you

got eyes for Pratt these days. You

in her pants yet?

Hey, do me a favor, Stillman, try

not to be such a prick.

You're the prick. Guys like you

walk around like you're king shit.

You give me a goddamn pain in the

ass, you think we owe you...

Come on! Connie. Come on! Cool it,

Jarrett! Connie! Connie. That's

enough.

No, Stillman, no! No!

Let go! Let go!

It's all right! He's crazy!   Just

calm down, uh?

You're crazy! You're crazy! You

know that?

Send him back where he came from!

Now, now, it's over. It's over.

All right!     Shit!

Here's your hat.

You want to talk? The guy's a

nothing.   He's a zero upstairs.

You used to know that about him,

Con. Ever since fourth grade,

you've known it.

So?

So you just make yourself look

stupid when you let him get to you

like that!

So I look stupid, is that it?

No, it isn't. What is it with you?

Huh? I don't know why you want to

be in this alone? You know, I miss

him too. Connie, the three of us

were best friends!

I can't help it, it hurts too much

to be around you. I gotta go.

Yeah. Okay.

Hello?

Hello. Is Karen there?

She...uh... Ah!... Bill?

Hello.

Yes, hello. Is Karen there? This is

Conrad Jarrett, calling. I'm a

friend of hers.

Karen's dead.

What? What?

She killed herself.

Let's have the best Christmas ever.

Ha!

We can. You know.

We could have the best year of our

whole lives.
