FADE IN

ON BLACK SCREEN

LINE OF TAPED KNUCKLES - NIGHT

smashing into the mud, as a football OFFENSIVE LINE comes

set, frosted breath steaming across to:

The DEFENSIVE LINE digging in, ready to explode.

CLOSE ON JOE KANE

E.S.U. quarterback, barking signals. The ball is snapped,

and we go to SLOW MOTION as the lines crash together in the

slop.

Joe rolls to the right, looking downfield. A huge DEFENSIVE

END bears down on him. Joe jukes. The end whips on by,

grabbing for jersey, slipping off. But big NUMBER 75 is

closing the gap. On the run, Joe releases a desperation pass

toward the end zone, just as 75 catches him and buries him

face-down in the swamp.

We FOLLOW THE BALL, spiraling through the slanting rain. RAY

GRIFFEN, black running back, glances back for it, two

DEFENSIVE BACKS with him. All three leap in unison, climbing

as high as they can, clutching, clawing for the ball. The

ball floats down, kisses off the tangle of fingers, splashes

to the ground, and rolls to a stop in the mud. Incomplete.

The BANG of the final gun snaps us back to LIVE ACTION.

Joe on his knees in the muck, stares at the goal line, then

drops his head in defeat.

ANGLE ON SAM WINTERS

Betraying little emotion, Coach SAM WINTERS, wiry, intense,

early 50's, takes off his headset, lets it drop, heads across

the field.

INT. LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

Coach Winters stands outside his office surrounded by

reporters, a bouquet of microphones stuck in his face.

Elsewhere in the locker room, we pick up a weary, mud-

splattered Joe Kane taking off his pads in front of his

locker. ALVIN MACK, black linebacker, comes by. Alvin exudes

danger; big, fast and hostile on the field, slightly surly,

a sense of repressed anger off it.

ON COACH WINTERS AGAIN

still fielding questions.

As Winters gets up to go, we hear:

INT. CHANCELLOR WILSON'S OFFICE - DAY

CHANCELLOR GRANT WILSON, 60, grey-haired eminence, sits behind

his desk. Seated across from him are Coach Winters and GALEN

HOWARD, 50, the Athletic Director.

Wilson points to a representation of a football field affixed

to the wall. A football rests on the 40 yard line, which is

marked 160 million. The end zone (60 yards away) is

$400,000,000.

INT. STADIUM TUNNEL - LATE AFTERNOON

Coach Winters flanked by two assistant coaches, HUMES and

CLAYTON, walks down a cavernous tunnel beneath the stands to

a waiting car. At the end of the tunnel, a scarecrow EFFIGY

of Coach Winters hangs from an overhead pipe.

Coach Winters stops, looks up at the effigy. Humes and Clayton

fear an outburst, a display of rage.

That's it. He strides on. Humes and Clayton race to catch

up.

MUSIC STARTS. TITLES BEGIN.

EXT. INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - EVENING

A Boeing 737 roars into the night sky.

INT. ST. LUKE'S HOME FOR BOYS - MORNING

Winters, Humes, Clayton and Joe Kane sit across from DARNELL

JEFFERSON and REVEREND WALLACE in a tattered parlor room.

Other boys of various ages and color look in from the

adjoining door. Darnell is black, good-looking, street-hip,

the letters D.J. shaved in block letters into his fade.

This gets a little chuckle from the Reverend. It was intended

to.

EXT. RURAL SOUTH CAROLINA TENANT FARM - DAY

We see a run-down tenant SHACK on the edge of a large cotton

field.

INT. TENANT SHACK - DAY

Two rooms. Dirt floor. Two-foot Christmas tree on an apple

cart. Alvin Mack's MOTHER opens a Christmas present as Alvin

and his TWO SISTERS look on. It's an ENGRAVED LIONSHEAD

DOORKNOCKER, the kind you'de find on the door of an affluent

home. The inscription reads THE MACK'S. Alvin's mother thinks

it's beautiful, but isn't sure what to do with it.

INT. COACH WINTERS' HOUSE - DAY

Winters' daughter LOUANNE, 20, is on the phone with her

father. Louanne is sexy, clothes too tight, but good-natured,

somewhat needy and loyal as a labrador. She holds a hopelessly

out-of-style sweater her dad's given her for Christmas.

INT. ROADSIDE MOTEL - DAY

Winters sits on the bed, eating Chinese take-out, the phone

cradled in his neck, talking to Louanne.

EXT. SMALL BRICK HOUSE - DAY

Battered and old, in a declining Pennsylvania neighborhood,

hard by a STEEL WORKS.

INT. SMALL BRICK HOUSE - DAY

Joe sits on the couch with his older brother, FRANK, watching

the bowl game he would have been in, had E.S.U. won their

last game. His FATHER, a grizzled man in his fifties, nods

in and out in a tattered armchair. All three have been

drinking beer, their empties scattered around. Frank tosses

Joe an Iron City beer.

As Joe's father heads for the kitchen, he hangs his empty

beer can, by the pull tab, on a branch of the Christmas tree.

We see that the whole tree is covered with cans.

INT. PHILADELPHIA BOY'S HOME - NIGHT

Darnell talks on a pay phone in the hall.

INT. OFFICE IN E.S.U. ATHLETIC DEPARTMENT - NIGHT

We see who Darnell is talking to: AUTUMN HALEY, beautiful

black girl, stylish, long straight hair, definitely not

street.

We PULL BACK and REVEAL Autumn in an office with 15 other

telephones, a coed on every one. ASST. COACH MYERS supervises

with a clipboard of names and numbers.

EXT. TUNNEL OF WOLFDEN STADIUM - DAY

Joe leads Darnell down to the end of the tunnel, where Autumn

is waiting. He introduces them. She's even more attractive

than Darnell thought she'd be.

She takes Darnell's hand and leads him out onto the field

where he's greeted by the E.S.U. BAND playing the school

fight song. The CHEERLEADERS whip into action, legs kicking,

pom-poms whirling.

The band parts and Darnell walks out into the 90,000 seat

stadium, an awesome sight for any young man. Autumn points

to the giant DIAMOND VISION SCOREBOARD. Darnell's name and

picture appear. The stadium P.A. ANNOUNCER cuts in.

Darnell, in his excitement, does a little end-zone dance.

Slaps hands with Joe.

EXT. PICTURESQUE CAMPUS WALK - NIGHT

Romantic, Ivy-League look, lit by soft-glo footlights. Darnell

and Autumn walk, side by side, stopping outside Autumn's

dorm.

He leans down to kiss her. She hesitates, not sure about

this, then comes forward, kisses him on the lips, starts to

let it deepen, then breaks it off.

As he watches her go up the steps, we go to:

EXT. THE BOYS HOME - DAY

Early February: It's National Decision Day and Darnell's

home is under seige. Reporters. Microphones. Television

cameras. Darnell steps out onto the porch wearing an ESU

jersey with #1 emblazoned on it.

MUSIC and TITLES END.

EXT. E.S.U. CAMPUS - DAY

A hot, late summer day. Over the deserted Quad, we see the

title: 6 MONTHS LATER.

It fades and we MOVE TO REVEAL a city BUS pulling up at a

curb adjacent to the Quad. Off steps Darnell, carrying one

battered suitcase. Joe Kane and BUD LITE KAMINSKY, offensive

line tackle, are there to greet him.

INT. BROWNING ATHLETIC DORM - DAY

A dorm devoted exclusively to football players. Luxurious

lounges, study halls, saunas, recreation and media rooms.

Spacious living quarters. A world unto itself.

Joe and Bud usher Darnell into his room.

Darnell looks around, taking it all in. He tries to be cool,

but this is easily the nicest room he's ever had.

Joe and Bud start down the hall. Darnell turns back into his

room, then starts to pace off it's dimensions, heel to toe.

EXT. THE 911 - NIGHT

College hang-out, bar, catering to athletes and their

admirers. A black HARLEY DAVIDSON, driven by Joe Kane with

Darnell on the back, pulls up at the curb. They get off,

head inside.

INT. THE 911 - NIGHT

Joe and Darnell pass a table of three girls, conspicuous

among them is Louanne Winters. Joe and Darnell give her a

nod and proceed on to a table where three fellow players

wait: Bud Lite, BOBBY COLLINS, good-looking, silver-tongued

ladies man and 2nd string quarterback, and STEVE LATTIMER,

heavily muscled, surf-punk defensive end. Between them is a

large pitcher of beer.

Bud takes a good-natured swipe at him. Lattimer deflects it.

Joe notices Bobby looking over at Louanne. She gives Bobby a

surreptitious little wave to come over and sit with her. He

gives her the "just a minute" sign.

Bobby laughs and heads over to Louanne's table, as Joe pours

himself another beer.

Alvin enters the bar, goes to Joe's table, plops a copy of

Sports Illustrated down in front of Joe.

On the cover is a picture of Joe and ONE OTHER QUARTERBACK,

TIM WAYMEN. The coverline reads, HEISMAN HOPEFULS: THE YEAR

OF THE QUARTERBACK.

Joe stares at the cover. He's more stunned than elated.

Joe drains his beer, pours another. Lattimer starts to read

form the article.

Muted chuckles, but set faces. The challenge accepted. Joe

chugs his beer, pours another.

EXT. TWO LANE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

The crowd from the 911 (Bud, Alvin, Lattimer, Darnell, Bobby

and Louanne) follow Joe down the hill behind the bar toward

a busy two-lane highway. Joe, a little drunker than the

others, starts HOWLING at the moon like a Timber Wolf. The

others join in.

Suddenly Joe makes a dash out onto the highway.

Joe stands on the white line, cars and trucks whizzing by,

then lies down on his back, arms at his side.

JOE'S POINT OF VIEW

Cars and trucks blast toward us, roar on by, right on top of

us, honking, spraying grime, shaking the asphalt.

Bud and the others on the side of the road are increasingly

worried now.

Pissed off, Bud sprints out to the white line. The draft-

wake of a passing truck almost blows him over.

Bud hesitates a second, scared, but stung by this dare.

Bud can't fight it. He lies down on the line, his head

touching Joe's feet. Joe begins to HOWL again. Bud joins in.

Alvin and the others can't believe it.

Bobby and Lattimer look at each other a beat. Time to ante

up. Both turn to Alvin.

Alvin snorts in disgust and starts out onto the blacktop.

Bobby and Lattimer smile, go to follow. Louanne grabs Bobby,

holds him back.

Bobby smiles, grabs her ass, pulls her to him, gives her a

long, passionate kiss, then sprints out to the white line,

leaving her breathless.

Alvin, Bobby and Lattimer lie down in front of Bud. Now

there's a line of five, a human highway median. Everybody

scared shitless, howling their lungs out.

Louanne and Darnell watch from the side of the road.

Finally, Joe laughing wildly, jumps up and they all scramble

back to safety. Out of breath, but pumped up, they exchange

exhilarated high fives. Alvin just shakes his head.

INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - MORNING

Twenty freshman football players, including Darnell, are

scattered at tables around the room, writing furiously in

test booklets, as a PROCTOR paces the room. Darnell starts

to write an answer, stops, stumped. Worried, he looks at the

clock, goes on to the next page.

EXT. E.S.U. CAMPUS - MORNING

Darnell and Joe walk across campus. Darnell carries a

gleaming, chromed TROPHY with a football player on top. He's

still thinking about the test.

Suddenly Darnell sees Autumn walking across the Quad.

Joe starts to protest, but Darnell is already off, racing

across the Quad, quickly catching up with Autumn.

She nods, slightly embarrassed.

She starts walking away.

She speeds up. He speeds up.

She's just about to say something when RAY GRIFFEN arrives.

Ray's the starting tailback, black, handsome, clean-cut,

well-spoken, middle class.

This is exactly what Autumn didn't want to happen. Ray and

Darnell eye each other like a couple of roosters.

Autumn can't believe he said this. She starts to interject

something to break the tension, but never gets the chance.

Autumn's mortification is complete.

EXT. E.S.U. CAMPUS - DAY

Establish the new, modern KELLER CENTER, home of the E.S.U.

Athletic Department.

INT. KELLER CENTER - DAY

The football meeting room. A quarter amphitheatre. The

Freshman, including Darnell, down in front. Nervous, talking

very little, eyes playing over the pictures of former E.S.U.

greats arranged on the Wall of Honor.

Behind them, the Upperclassmen, bantering, conversation

punctuated with laughter.

A door opens. The Assistant Coaches file in. The room hushes

immediately. Coach Winters walks in. The Upperclassmen break

into applause; the Freshmen quickly take their cue and join

in.

The upperclassmen hoot, as Darnell, embarrassed, takes off

his earring.

The players nod reverentially at this established axiom of

the football cannon.

Spreading smiles all around. It's good to be a football

player.

The smiles are gone. Lots of set faces now. Shame. anger,

retribution.

The freshmen are hanging on every word.

He smashes the trophy on the podium, breaking it in half,

shattering the base. Darnell and the other freshmen are agog.

The upperclassmen stifle laughs, particularly Ray Griffen.

The upperclassmen nod, steely, purposeful. We go to the

freshmen. They're not so sure.

EXT. E.S.U. PRACTICE FIELD - DAY

Passing drills. Joe Kane takes a snap, fades to pass, throws

an out. The ball sails two feet over the receiver's head.

Joe's angry with himself.

EXT. PRACTICE FIELD - DAY

Scrimmage. Joe hands off to Darnell. He sweeps right, cuts

it up, blows past the end. In a spectacular display of broken

field running, Darnell breaks to the sideline, cuts back,

eluding the corner back, and stiffarms the safety. Alvin,

pursuing the play, finally tackles him from behind, stripping

the ball at the same time. There's a wild scramble for the

fumble. Darnell is crushed under the pile, as the defense

recovers it, ruining an otherwise brilliant run.

The players unpile to reveal Darnell, writhing on the ground,

the wind knocked out of him. Ray Griffen runs by to take his

place.

The scrimmage moves up 15 yards leaving Darnell behind.

Winters sprints over to Lattimer, grabs him by the face mask.

Lattimer nods chastised. Winters moves over to check on

Darnell.

Winters extends a hand. Darnell grabs it, struggles shakily

to his feet

Winters wheels off leaving a wobbly Darnell alone with his

football.

INT. WINTER'S OFFICE, LOCKER ROOM - DAY

Winters, mad as hell, is berating his assistant coaches who

are sitting, cowed in his office.

INT. LOCKER ROOM - LATER AFTERNOON

Dead tired players toweling off, dressing. The trainer's

room is crowded with aching, cramped-up, contused players.

Across the way, Lattimer lifts weights, alone in the weight

room. Clayton and Humes consider this from outside Winters'

office.

Winters, who's heard all this, comes by.

Winters walks on into his office. Clayton nods, realizing

this subject is now closed.

INT. DARNELL'S ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

Darnell walks in, wrung out from the day's practice, stumbles

to the bed where he sees something that stops him - lying

there is his PENNSYLVANIA STATE ALL AMERICAN TROPHY. Coach

Winters actually smashed a replica. A smile appears on

Darnell's tired face.

INT. TRAINING TABLE DINING ROOM - NIGHT

For football players only. Bud Lite moves through the

cafeteria line.

ANGLE ON DARNELL

at another table with Alvin and several other black players.

Lattimer is the only white.

Darnell's stung by this. He'd like to think of himself as

capable of more.

Suddenly, Coach Winters appears at the door, a surprise

visitor to the training table. All the players wearing

baseball caps, quickly doff them. Winters is angry.

The players all look at each other, then reluctantly get up

and change tables. Darnell sits next to Joe.

Coach Winters surveys the scene, sees that all the tables

are integrated now.

He turns and walks on out. Immediately, the players begin to

drift back to their old tables.

INT. WEIGHT ROOM - NIGHT

Joe, Bud Lite and Bobby Collins, all suffering from various

aches and pains are getting Naperson and analgesic balm out

of the non-prescription drug cabinet. Joe pops a Nap and

looks across to the weight room where a stunning co-ed CAMILLE

SCHAEFFER works a knee lift. Camille's the perfect marriage

of Southern patrician beauty and athletic confirmation. Joe

leaves the others, heads over, pokes his head in.

Camille stops her knee lift, turns to Joe. We think she's

going to fire on him. Wrong.

Camille starts to walk away.

CAMILLE - TENNIS COURTS - NIGHT

smashing a two-fisted forehand right at us, grunting with

the exertion. Joe scrambles to get it back, but Camille's a

world-class player. She attacks with a vengeance, blasting

every shot ala Jimmy Connors, as Bud Lite and Bobby Collins

watch, amazed.

We begin a SERIES OF CUTS detailing Camille's relentless

dismantling of Joe: Camille drilling a backhand down the

line, Joe barely getting it back to the net. Camille hitting

a powerhouse service ace, Joe lunging and whiffing the return.

Camille crushing another forehand. Joe crushes it back, sends

it over the fence and into the parking lot. Camille serving

again at match point. Joe pops up a weak return. Camille

puts it away with a powerhouse overhead, the ball almost

knocking Joe down. He flings his racket against the fence.

Camille comes to the net to shake hands, but Joe hangs back.

And she walks away along to the net. Joe goes after her,

pissed.

Camille's taken aback, not realizing she'd struck a nerve.

Now Joe walks away and Camille goes after him.

Camille considers, tries to figure out what she'd dislike

least, knowing it'd be cheap to choose neither.

Camille walks off, disappearing through the gate. Joe walks

off in the other direction. Bud Lite and Bobby follow.

FADE IN:

EXT. E.S.U. CAMPUS - MORNING

Opening day of school. We take CUTS of students arriving,

football players checking out the new girls from atop the

wall of the athletic dorm, Louanne and Autumn greeting

returning sisters at the sorority, students registering for

classes etc.

INT. ACADEMIC ADVISOR'S OFFICE - MORNING

Darnell sits across from WILLIAM SMITH, Academic Advisor.

Darnell is clearly deflated by this painful indication of

his academic standing.

INT. ATHLETIC DEPARTMENT CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

A meeting of the football brain trust; Coach Winters, Athletic

Director, GALEN HOWARD, a publicist, SHARON BRAVER, and the

Sports Information Director (S.I.D.) LARRY NICHOLS. Also

present is Joe Kane, somewhat discomfited at being the center

of all this attention.

Joe is increasingly uneasy with all this.

If Joe was uneasy before, he's overwhelmed now. He tries not

to show it. After all, who could turn down a Heisman campaign?

Still it's a megaton of pressure.

Nichols holds up a black CAMPAIGN BUTTON with the phrase

"Kane is Able" enblazoned on it in gold letters. This gets a

rise out of everyone except Joe, who's still not sure about

all this.

INT. JOE KANE'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

Joe lies on his bed, staring up at the ceiling, unable to

get to sleep.

INT. CAMILLE'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

The phone rings. Camille, who's been asleep, rolls over and

answers it.

ON JOE

He hangs up.

INT. CAMPUS LIBRARY - DAY

Autumn sits at a tutorial table, looking at her notes. She

becomes aware of someone approaching. She looks up to see

Darnell.

Autumn looks back to where Darnell is pointing. Sure enough,

SCOTT SHERMAN is hard at work with another Tutor. Autumn

can't believe it. She tries to compose herself.

Darnell sits down across the table from her.

Darnell is genuinely hurt by this dose of reality. His

customary bravado melts away.

Autumn, disarmed by his sudden humility, has no real rebuttal.

She would have had to tutor him anyway, but now she's having

trouble being angry about it.

ALVIN MACK

At another table, looking distracted and bored as his TUTOR

reads his history assignment to him. Alvin takes out a walkman

and puts the headphones on. WE HEAR A HORN BEEP.

EXT. CAMILLE'S DORM - LATE AFTERNOON

Camille comes out the front door, summoned by the horn. She

stops at the sight of something. We REVERSE TO REVEAL Joe on

his Harley.

He holds out a motorcycle helmet toward her, daring her. She

burns, but her competitiveness makes it impossible for her

to decline this challenge.

Joe smiles and kicks the starter. Camille climbs on and they

roar off.

EXT. TWO LANE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

Just outside town. Joe and Camille come down the highway at

moderate speed. Camille's hanging on for dear life, but we

can tell she's enjoying it.

Joe immediately accelerates, throwing Camille's head back.

Her SHRIEK is lost in the whine of the engine, as they speed

away from camera.

They approach a high-banked turn, beyond which appears to be

a long, sheer dropoff. Joe looks back at Camille, smiles

devilishly, not looking where he's going. Camille sees they're

heading straight for the edge.

Too late. Joe brakes, fishtails, but goes over the top of

the bank, off the edge, flying out into oblivion, Camille

screaming.

ANGLE ON HARLEY

As it plops down onto a wide LEDGE not visible from the road,

three feet below the top of the bank. Joe lands it, skids to

a professional stop, breaks into raucous laughter. Camille

jumps off the bike, scared stiff and livid with anger.

Camille's ready to throttle him, then something catches her

ear. Sure enough, there are SEVERAL DOGS BARKING in the

distance. Joe smiles at her. She looks away, still angry,

but amused in spite of herself.

INT. ROADSIDE BAR - NIGHT

Working class, sawdust floor, George Thoroughgood's "Who Do

You Love" on the jukebox. Camille and Joe are sitting in a

booth. Joe putting away the beers.

Joe gets up, takes Camille's hand and pulls her to her feet.

They dance to a slow song.

INT. ATHLETIC DORM GARAGE - NIGHT

Joe roars in on his motorcycle. Parks. Starts inside. Finds

himself face to face with a very unhappy Coach Winters.

Winters holds out his hand.

Joe hesitates a second, then reluctantly hands over his

motorcycle keys.

Joe nods, contrite. Winters just walks on off.

INT. STUDY HALL - CAMPUS LIBRARY - DAY

Autumn is tutoring Darnell, checking her lesson notes.

Autumn wasn't ready for this level of hardship. She tries to

press on gamely.

Autumn jumps up.

Autumn realizes she's in the library and sits back down.

Autumn's anger melts away in the face of this painful truth.

Autumn just nods, still trying to take this all in.

Autumn knows this is no line. He means it. She's seeing him

with new eyes. Moved by his pain, engaged by his sincerity,

and more than a little taken by his regard for her.

ON ALVIN

across the room with his tutor.

INT. FOOTBALL MEETING - AFTERNOON

A video projector projects various football formations on

the wall.

MUSIC UP - MONTAGE SEQUENCE BEGINS

EXT. JOE'S ROOM - EVENING

Joe watches Bud Lite, Darnell, Alvin and Lattimer file in

and unveil a life-size CARDBOARD STAND-UP of Joe's Sports

Illustrated cover pose. They whoop it up, as Joe tries to

muster some enthusiasm.

INT. STUDY HALL - NIGHT

Autumn's pointing out a figure on a graph in Darnell's math

book. As she explains, Darnell leans close to kiss her. Autumn

quickly leans away, glances around to see if anyone saw

Darnell's attempt. Darnell laughs.

INT. AMERICAN HISTORY CLASSROOM - DAY

A group of football players sits in the back of the class.

As the HISTORY PROFESSOR lectures at the board, Darnell

furiously takes notes. Scott Sherman, seizing the opportunity,

leans forward from the desk behind him and pokes the football

out of Darnell's left hand. Darnell, Scott and two other

FRESHMAN FOOTBALL PLAYERS spring out of their seats,

scrambling after the loose ball. The prof and the other

students watch appalled as Darnell and the others dive under

chairs and overturn desks in pursuit of the elusive ball.

Finally, Darnell, winded and disheveled, comes up with it.

He and the others quickly return to their seats. The prof

looks at Darnell aghast.

INT. RAQUETBALL COURT - DAY

Joe and Camille are locked up in a furious game of raquetball.

Joe makes a wicked kill shot on the last point, and pumps a

fist in triumph. Camille, pissed at losing, throws her racket

and stomps around.

EXT. CAMPUS - DAY

Darnell and Autumn are having a daytime tutoring session on

a secluded patch of lawn. Darnell holds his football. As he

begins to read aloud from East of Eden, Autumn pokes the

ball out of his hand. They both scramble for it, Darnell

winding up slightly on top of her. They eye each other a

beat. Darnell bends down to kiss her. She lets herself kiss

him for a second, then gets up and starts to collect her

books.

INT. ATHLETIC CENTER - DAY

Several of the players are gathered around a bulletin board

in the hall. The starting lineup for the first game has been

posted. Darnell traces his finger from the designation

TAILBACK over to the name RAY GRIFFEN. He drops his eyes,

obviously disappointed.

Lattimer, meanwhile, is checking the defensive board. He

finds his name posted as a starting defensive end. Punching

the air, he dashes out of the building.

EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

Lattimer, in his euphoria, races out into the lot, and begins

head-butting car windows. He breaks out three in a row, and

yells in triumph, his forehead dripping blood.

Winters, walking with the TEAM TRAINER, has seen this from

across the street. He knows there's something dark at work

here.

MUSIC AND MONTAGE END

INT. FOOTBALL MEETING ROOM - NIGHT

The chairs are arranged in several circles, ten players to a

circle, like a bunch of formalized huddles. Coach Winters

addresses the assembly.

ANGLE ON LATTIMER IN HIS CIRCLE

INT. CAMPUS BALLROOM - GAME DAY

The team walks through several plays. They wear coats and

ties, but no socks. Their ankles are taped.

INT. LOCKER ROOM - GAME DAY

Before the game. An NCAA OFFICIAL gives Lattimer a little

test tube to urinate in for his drug test. Lattimer goes

into one of the restroom stalls, reaches around to the back

of the tank, where a VIAL OF CLEAN URINE is taped. He pours

it in the test vial.

INT. FOOTBALL MEETING ROOM - THE NIGHT BEFORE AGAIN

INT. LOCKER ROOM - GAME DAY

Darnell listening to a Walkman, is going through a pregame

ritual by his locker; pivoting from leg to leg, switching

the ball from arm to arm.

INT. FOOTBALL MEETING ROOM - THE NIGHT BEFORE AGAIN

INT. LOCKER ROOM - GAME DAY

Joe sits off in a corner by himself, his head back against

the wall, staring out into space, the only movement the

rhythmic tapping of his feet.

INT. FOOTBALL MEETING ROOM - THE NIGHT BEFORE

INT. LOCKER ROOM - GAME DAY

Alvin, his ass-kicking game face on, walks over to where

Lattimer is finishing decorating his face with Indian war

paint. They chuck each other's pads, then Lattimer opens his

mouth. Alvin spits into it. Then Lattimer spits into Alvin's.

Darnell can't believe this shit.

We move in on the burning ferocity of Alvin's eyes and

INT. STADIUM TUNNEL - GAME DAY

The Players are bunched together in the tunnel, slapping

pads, yelling encouragement. Winters waves them forward.

They start to run down the tunnel.

PLAYERS P.O.V.

CAMERA runs with the players as the light at the end of the

tunnel becomes larger and brighter. Crowd NOISE becomes louder

until finally the camera emerges into the stadium and the

light and 95,000 VOICES ROAR. AND ROAR! AND ROAR! This is

Big Time College Football.

INT. RADIO BROADCAST BOOTH

E.S.U. announcer BRAD HARVEY and colorman, HARMON SLOAN are

holding forth.

EXT. THE FIELD - DAY

The crowd stands, waving banners, as the E.S.U. kicker comes

forward and kicks the ball high into the fall sky. The

MISSISSIPPI STATE RETURN MAN fields the ball at the four

yard line and returns it to the 22 where he's buried. The

defense trots out and huddles up.

The Mississippi State offense breaks it's huddle, comes to

the line of scrimmage. Alvin, prowling behind the line, locks

eyes with the tailback, No.23.

The tailback looks away.

On the sidelines, Darnell is watching this exchange.

ANGLE ON ALVIN AGAIN

The ball is snapped. The quarterback pitches to the tailback

as Alvin charges into the hole, screaming at the top of his

lungs. The tailback, eyes wide with fear, cuts back, away

from Alvin, where he's promptly crunched by Lattimer. The

ball flies loose, there's a scramble, Alvin comes up with

it. E.S.U. ball.

ANGLE ON

The bench and stands erupt as Lattimer and Alvin but heads

and trot off the field.

Joe leads the offense on. A disappointed Darnell stands on

the sidelines.

Joe begins to howl like a wolf. The others join in. A pack

of Timberwolves. They break the huddle, come to the line of

scrimmage. Bud Lite begins to sing.

Bud lines up opposite a big, black DEFENSIVE TACKLE.

Joe hits the 4 count, and the ball is snapped. Bud Lite and

the Big Tackle fire out. Bud drives a forearm into the stomach

of the Black Tackle, doubling him over. The Black Tackle

comes back, slamming a forearm up under Bud's chin, snapping

his neck back.

Joe, meanwhile, fades to pass, pump fakes, steps up. Bud

Lite, chicken fighting the Black Tackle, sticks his fingers

in the Tackle's eyes, then cut-blocks him to the ground. The

Tackle falls on Bud, and smashes a fist into his ribs. Bud

rolls him over.

Joe spots his flanker back, MAURICE WARD, on a flag pattern.

Lofts a perfect spiral to him in the corner of the endzone.

Touchdown.

The crowd goes wild, as Bud Lite pushes off the Black Tackle's

throat getting up from the pile. Joe pumps a fist in the

air, hugs Ward, as the team celebrates. MUSIC BEGINS.

ANGLE ON SCOREBOARD

It reads E.S.U. 28, Mississippi State 20. 4th Quarter.

Darnell jazzed at his first chance to see action, buttons

his chinstrap, races onto the field.

ANGLE ON DARNELL

He takes a handoff, runs a trap up the middle, is hit by

THREE TACKLERS, clawing at the ball. They bring him down,

but Darnell doesn't fumble. He gets up, still clutching the

ball, and starts back to the huddle with it. The REFEREE

hustles after him.

Darnell, suddenly realizing, gives it up. Even Winters has

to laugh. We go to:

ANGLE ON LATTIMER

Lattimer, sacking the quarterback, tackling him high, ripping

his helmet off. Lattimer runs off the field, holding it up

like a trophy.

The gun sounds, the game is over.

ANGLE ON COACH WINTERS

Accepting congratulations from his staff.

ANGLE ON BUD LITE AND THE BLACK TACKLE

walking off the field together, both their jerseys blood-

stained.

INT. PENTHOUSE HOTEL SUITE - AFTERNOON

A reception of some sort for the players is in progress.

Darnell, looking a little lost, fills his cup from a punch

bowl. A FAT CAT ALUMNUS approaches him.

As he walks by, he slips an ENVELOPE into Darnell's coat

pocket. Darnell opens it to find a 50 dollar bill. Surprised,

he goes over to Alvin.

INT. JOE'S ROOM - EVENING

Joe sits alone on his bed watching T.V. He's being interviewed

in the locker room, a bouquet of microphones in his face.

Joe hates this question. We go to the screen.

ANGLE ON SCREEN

The image changes to ESPN anchor CHRIS BERMAN in the studio.

EXT. CAMPUS - EVENING

Joe walks across campus, headed for Camille's dorm.

INT. CAMILLE'S DORM - NIGHT

Joe comes down the hall, knocks on Camille's door. No answer.

Knocks again. Nothing. Disappointed, he turns and walks away.

INT. FRATERNITY HOUSE - NIGHT

The post-game victory party is in full swing. All the players,

their girls and various groupies, dancing, drinking,

celebrating. Bud Lite and Joe stand drinking beer, watching

the action.

Bobby, who's overheard this, walks by with Louanne.

ANGLE ON DARNELL

sitting across the room with Alvin but his attention is on

Autumn and Ray out on the dance floor. Alvin notices.

Darnell challenged by this, gets up and goes over to where

Ray and Autumn are standing. A slow tune plays.

Autumn realizes this could quickly get out of hand.

Ray reluctantly backs off. Darnell and Autumn start to dance.

Several players who've picked up on the tension, watch them

as they move around the floor. They try to pretend they're

just having a nice little chat.

She looks at him a long beat. She doesn't need this

complication, this conflict, but she can't say no.

The song ends. Ray moves in to reclaim her.

Darnell, pissed, gives Ray a shove.

Ray lunges back at him, but quickly several players, led by

Joe and Bud Lite, step between them. Darnell shrugs them off

and leaves the party.

Ray takes Autumn's arm, pulls her out onto the patio.

Autumn rips free of his grip, and walks out of the party

too.

EXT. CAMPUS - NIGHT

Darnell sits alone on a bench under an old Willow, just

staring out at the night. He hears a voice behind him.

He turns. It's Autumn.

INT. FRATERNITY HOUSE - NIGHT

The party's still in full gear. Ray is now chatting up a few

of the groupies. Joe and Bud Lite sit off in a corner. Joe's

knocked back several beers. He's a little tipsy, and lost in

thought.

Joe's gaze falls on a sultry brunette, SHERI, at a table

across the way. She's eyeing Joe big time. She wants him. He

stares back at her. She doesn't blink.

EXT. CAMPUS LIBRARY - NIGHT

Camille, carrying an armload of books, comes down the library

steps, having been studying late. As she heads for her dorm,

she sees Joe and Sheri going across the Quad; Sheri draped

around Joe, nuzzling him.

Joe looks over, spots Camille, stops; surprised, embarrassed

to see her. They exchange a look. Camille, upset, turns and

wheels off. Joe wants to say something to her, but can't get

it out.

ON DARNELL AND AUTUMN

We don't know where yet, but they seem to be slipping and

sliding, clutching on to each other.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

INT. ICE SKATING RINK - NIGHT

Near closing time. Darnell and Autumn lurch and stumble around

the ice, collapsing against the boards now and then. There

are few other skaters at this hour.

Autumn laughs, as the house lights start to blink, indicating

it's closing time.

They make their way to an opening in the boards, stumble

over to a bench, begin to unlace.

She laughs, looks at him a beat, starts to come forward to

kiss him. He puts a finger to her lips.

She hesitates a beat, then comes forward again. They fall

into a deep kiss. We PULL BACK to LONGSHOT. Two people alone

in the expanse of the ice rink. The lights flicker and go

out.

INT. WEIGHT ROOM - LATE NIGHT

Camille, unable to sleep, enters in her workout clothes.

Languid, melancholy, she goes to the treadmill, as Joe comes

out of the steam room with nothing but a towel around his

waist. Both are surprised to see the other.

Camille just nods. Long, silent pause.

He turns, starts toward the door.

Camille hesitates, not sure whether to believe him, then

gets off the bike and walks toward him.

Camille, really steamed now, snatches the towel from around

Joe's waist, leaving him naked.

Camille snaps the towel at him, driving him back. Joe's

totally thrown by this reaction in her.

She snaps the towel again, backing him against the training

table.

She pounds on his chest, pushing him back on the table.

He looks at her a beat, then pulls her mouth down to his.

They fall into a long, white-hot kiss.

INT. THE TRAINING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

Joe and Camille are making love passionately, energetically.

Camille, still worked up, rolls up on top.

Joe rolls back on top, the momentum carrying both of them

off the table and out of sight.

INT. HUGE LECTURE HALL - MORNING

Some 100 students are taking a history test in blue books. A

T.A., checking attendance, walks up to Louanne. She's uneasy

as the T.A. checks his chart.

Louanne knows she's in deep trouble.

INT. COACH'S VIDEO ROOM - DAY

A high-tech room full of video machines and monitors used to

run simultaneous views of different positions during the

same play. A grim-looking group of assistant coaches

approaches Winters as he runs through and reprograms the

images on the screen.

Winters' face goes dead.

INT. COACH WINTERS' DEN - DAY

Winters, enraged, is venting his spleen at Louanne.

She gets up and walks out of the room. Winters closes his

eyes and slumps down on the couch.

INT. STUDY HALL - NIGHT

Darnell sits at his table waiting for Autumn. Autumn storms

in, obviously upset about something. She slaps a corrected

test down in front of him.

She shakes her head and walks away. Darnell's grin fades. He

looks at his test, a hint of tears in his eyes. He's

embarrassed and deeply worried.

INT. FOOTBALL LOCKER ROOM - DAY

The players are dressing for Monday practice, but it's

strangely subdued. Bobby Collins opens his locker to find a

BULLET-RIDDLED PRACTICE JERSEY hanging inside. Immediately

the rest of the players burst into raucous laughter.

Suddenly the room goes silent. Standing in the doorway is

Coach Winters.

He says nothing, looks around the room, the players avoiding

his gaze. His eyes come to rest on Bobby. Bobby tries to

hide the shirt, but Winters has seen. Winters just stares at

Bobby a beat, then.

With that, he turns and walks out the door. The players remain

silent. Bobby throws the shirt in the trash.

INT. LOUANNE'S SORORITY HOUSE - DAY

Winters walks in the front door, past the desk, up the stairs

and down the hall to his daughter's room. She's packing her

things. He goes over to her, takes her in his arms and hugs

her tight. Neither speak. A tear rolls down Louanne's cheek.

Hits the floor.

EXT. HALL OF ATHLETIC BUILDING - DAY

A very nervous Bobby Collins comes down the hall and knocks

on Coach Winter's door.

INT. COACH WINTER'S OFFICE

Bobby enters and stands across from Winters' desk. Winters

doesn't invite him to sit.

Bobby does. Instantly.

Bobby just stands there a beat, in confusion and disbelief.

There is no wavering, no sympathy in Winters' eyes. Finally,

dazed and disoriented, Bobby turns and walks out.

EXT. E.S.U. CAMPUS LIBRARY - DAY

Joe is posed in front of the school library, one of it's

more photogenic buildings. T.V. sportscaster LYNN SWANN and

his video crew wait to interview him as a MAKEUP GIRL finishes

applying makeup to Joe's face. Publicist Sharon Braver watches

like a hawk.

An assistant marks the take, and Swann turns to Joe.

EXT. PRACTICE FIELD - DAY

A phalanx of photographers crowd around, snapping away as

Joe goes through passing drills.

EXT. CAMPUS LIBRARY - DAY, THE PRESENT AGAIN

INT. T.V. STUDIO - NIGHT

Joe is being interviewed by DALLAS PERRY on a local television

show.

EXT. CAMPUS LIBRARY - THE PRESENT AGAIN

Sharon Braver steps directly in front of the video camera,

waves off the take.

Braver takes Joe aside, talks to him confidentially.

INT. PIZZA PARLOR - NIGHT

Joe and Camille are sharing a pizza, but not alone. A video

spotlight shines on them, as yet another crew rolls tape.

EXT. CAMPUS LIBRARY - THE PRESENT AGAIN

Joe nods and heads back in front of the camera.

EXT. E.S.U. QUAD - NIGHT

A huge bonfire burns, as a large segment of the student body

has gathered in front of the Timberwolf statue. The

cheerleaders, all wearing "KANE IS ABLE" buttons, whip the

crowd up, as Joe is introduced on the podium.

The cheerleaders begin to chant, "Let's go, Joe." On "Joe",

they assume the Heisman trophy pose. Joe seems slightly

embarrassed by it all.

EXT. CAMPUS LIBRARY - THE PRESENT AGAIN

Swann shoots Braver a poisonous look.

EXT. EMBANKMENT - NIGHT

Joe and Camille sit on a bank looking down at the railroad

tracks below. Neither says anything. Joe seems strangely

preoccupied. Camille decides to break the silence.

Infuriated, she slaps him across the face.

She turns and storms away up the hill, as we hear a TRAIN

WHISTLE. Joe watches her go, then starts down the hill toward

the tracks as the train comes into view.

Camille stops, turns back, sees Joe headed for the tracks,

starts to worry.

Joe reaches the grade and steps into the middle of the tracks

facing the oncoming train. Horrified, Camille runs down the

embankment toward him.

As the train approaches, it's horn blaring, Joe lies face

down on the tracks, his hands gripping the railroad ties.

Camille arrives at the bottom of the hill in time to see the

train race over him. She falls to her knees screaming.

Under the train, we see Joe desperately hugging the ground,

head down, toes dug in, hands clutching the ties. It's like

a tornado under there, dirt debris flying everywhere, his

clothes flapping wildly.

The train passes. Camille looks up, afraid to breath as Joe

lies motionless on the tracks. Suddenly he stirs, pushes

himself up to his knees. She lets out a scream of joy, races

toward him, as he gets to his feet, stumbles off the grade.

She hugs him to her, tears streaming down her face, helps

him over to the embankment.

The question hangs in the air.

He pulls her to him, kisses her hair, they slump against

each other.

EXT. WOLF DEN STADIUM - DAY

STEVE ZABRISKIE and BO SCHEMBECKLER in the foreground, the

jammed to capacity stadium in the background. This shot is

going out on nationwide T.V., the college Game of the Week.

ANGLE ON FIELD

Joe brings the offense to the line of scrimmage. Yells

signals.

Joe fades to pass, looks right, looks left, can't find a

receiver, decides to run for it. He sprints up the middle,

15, 10; a SAFETY comes at him at the 5. We see

Joe's P.O.V. through HELMETCAM. He pushes the lunging safety

away, turns back just in time to be blasted by the OTHER

SAFETY he never saw. Joe is knocked down, over the goal line

and out cold. The crowd goes wild.

Joe lies motionless as his teamates run over to him.

We go to Winters, worried on the sideline, as the celebration

around him begins to die down.

ANGLE ON JOE

As he's carried off the field, his arms around two linemen's

shoulders, and lowered onto the bench. We go to a BLURRY

IMAGE of a man's face waving something. We REVERSE to REVEAL

a DOCTOR waving smelling salts under Joe's nose. Joe begins

to come around. The doctor holds up two fingers.

EXT. THE FIELD - DAY

Michigan comes to the line of scrimmage. As Tim Waymen gets

under center, Alvin begins to yell at him.

Waymen begins to call signals.

The ball is snapped. Waymen fakes a handoff to his fullback,

hides the ball on his hip, fades to pass. On the sideline,

Coach Winters yells, "Pass! Pass!"

Alvin's not fooled by the run, he shakes his blocker and

takes dead aim on Waymen. Just as Waymen releases the ball,

Alvin blasts him, driving him into the turf.

The ball, however, flies through the air, a perfect spiral.

The E.S.U. secondary has been fooled by the play fake and is

a step behind. The ball comes down in the hands of the

Michigan tight end, JERRY HUNT.

Winters slams his headphones to the ground.

ANGLE ON JOE

The Doctor examines Joe, shines a light in his eyes, makes

him track his finger, etc.

Alvin, meanwhile, plops down on the bench in disgust.

Coach Winters goes to Darnell.

Griffen slams his helmet to the ground.

EXT. FIELD - DAY

Joe breaks the huddle as the E.S.U. offense comes to the

line.

Joe fades to pass once again, lets the rush come, then flares

out a screen pass to Darnell. Darnell grabs it and takes

off, slipping tackles, cutting back, juking. Darnell finally

runs out of bounds at the twenty.

ANGLE ON DARNELL

coming back to the huddle, pumped up. Joe kneels in the

center.

He begins to howl, as do all the others. The Call of the

Wild.

They clap hands, come to the line. Joe looks over the defense,

bends under center and barks signals, The ball is snapped.

Action goes to SLOW MOTION.

Joe fakes to Darnell, fades to pass. The Michigan cornerback

comes on a blitz, locked on Joe. Joe starts to roll, but

knows the corner will catch him. On the run, he launches the

ball toward Darnell. Darnell opens his hands to receive it,

but at the last second, the Michigan SAFETY steps in front

and intercepts it.

Joe sinks to his knees in frustration. The blitzing cornerback

does a quick pit-pat on Joe's helmet. Winters looks like

he's been punched.

As Michigan and Tim Waymen celebrate on the sideline, we go

to:

INT. BROADCAST BOOTH - AFTERNOON

Steve Zabriskie is doing the wrap-up, the emptying stadium

behind him.

INT. E.S.U. LOCKER ROOM - AFTERNOON

Players undress and shower in relative silence. No joy here.

The door of the locker room opens, and a flood of reporters

enter. Joe hides back in the showers, leaning his forehead

against the wall, the water coursing over him.

EXT. TUNNEL BENEATH STADIUM - LATE AFTERNOON

Darnell comes out of the locker room, having showered and

dressed. He's surprised to see Autumn and her father talking

to Coach Humes.

Darnell is jolted by this question. It's obvious that Autumn

has never told her dad about him.

Darnell would like to crawl under a rock.

There's a slight tone of condescension in Mr. Haley's voice.

He realizes Darnell hasn't passed his entrance exam. This is

not lost on Darnell.

Before Autumn can respond, Ray Griffen approaches from the

other direction.

Darnell embarrassed and humiliated, hears all this as he

walks away. Autumn wants to go explain, but can't in front

of her father.

INT. FRAT HOUSE - NIGHT

The post-game party. Not as raucous as after the opening

game victory. A few players are dancing, but most are sitting,

drinking, commiserating.

INT. UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Lattimer's sitting on the bed with a coed named LESLIE.

They're kissing softly, light necking. Lattimer starts to

unbutton her blouse. She begins to demur.

Lattimer grabs her arm roughly, pulls her back to the bed.

She's starting to get a little scared.

He tries to kiss her again, she pushes him away, starts for

the door. Angered, that steroid pump in his eyes, he grabs

her again, throws her violently on the bed. She screams.

He gets on the bed, kneels above her. She starts to struggle.

He slaps her across the face, rips her blouse open. Freaked,

she begins to scream and kick. Enraged, Lattimer slaps her

around, picks her up, shakes her like a rag doll, slaps her

some more, throws her to the floor. Picks her up again, when

suddenly the door BURSTS OPEN and Bud Lite and Alvin race

in.

Bud Lite and Alvin charge Lattimer, try to wrestle him down,

but his hormone level is so high, he fights like a bull. Two

other players charge in and finally all four are able to

shackle Lattimer. He continues to struggle a bit, then gives

up, a panting, sweating, shaking hulk.

Lattimer breaks down and cries.

INT. JOE'S ROOM - NIGHT

Joe lies on his bed, a bottle of vodka next to his coca-cola.

He stares at the larger than life cardboard stand-up of

himself. He takes a drink, then gets up and grabs his jacket.

The phone rings. He looks at it a beat, then walks out of

the room.

INT. CAMILLE'S ROOM - NIGHT

Camille's on the phone, waiting, the one calling Joe. She

listens a few more rings, hangs up, concerned.

INT. WINTERS HIGH-TECH VIDEO ROOM - NIGHT

Winters sits at the main console replaying the game-ending

interception over and over. The phone rings.

INT. WINTERS ATHLETIC OFFICE - NIGHT

The rest of the locker room is dark except for the light on

in Winters' office. All the assistant coaches are there.

All eyes go to Winters.

INT. COACH WINTERS LOCKER ROOM OFFICE - 20 MINUTES LATER

Close on a contrite, but shaken Steve Lattimer.

Lattimer nods, he knows it's true.

INT. LOCAL BAR - NIGHT

Not the 911 we saw earlier. Joe sits at a table in the back,

with Darnell, drinking tequila with a beer chaser. Both are

down in the dumps. At a nearby table there's a group of

TOWNIES and their GIRLFRIENDS.

Joe looks up to see one of the townies' girls, DEBBIE, giving

him the once over and a little smile. Joe smiles back, not

really interested. Debbie's BOYFRIEND notices.

The boyfriend, drunk and looking for trouble, goes over to

Joe's table.

Joe says nothing.

Joe gets up to go. The boyfriend grabs him, Joe pushes him

away. The guy charges Joe. The bar owner rushes to the phone

as a full scale brawl begins. Joe takes a blow, knocks the

boyfriend back into a table, knocking beer bottles to the

floor. The boyfriend falls on one, opening a deep gash in

his shoulder.

EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

A speeding car goes by us, weaving, crossing the yellow line

on the curves.

INT. SPEEDING CAR - NIGHT

Joe's driving, Darnell's holding on. Suddenly we hear SIRENS.

Joe sees flashing lights in the rear-view mirror.

INT. COACH WINTERS' HOUSE - LATE NIGHT

Winters is asleep. The phone rings. He picks it up.

INT. COACH WINTERS' STADIUM OFFICE - DAY

Joe sits across the desk from Winters, just the two of them.

Joe doesn't believe it, but he manages a nod, as he gets up

to leave.

Joe walks on out, Winters watches him go, then slams the

desk in anger. Drained, he sinks back in his chair.

EXT. CAMPUS - DAY

Darnell's walking across campus toward class. Autumn sees

him, calls out to him.

Darnell doesn't slow up. Autumn has to run to catch up.

Darnell walks away. Autumn can only watch him go.

INT. JOE'S ROOM - DAY

Joe finishes packing his bags. He sees a picture of Camille

on the dresser. Picks it up, looks at it a beat, drops it in

the trash. He carries his Heisman cardboard standup into the

shower, pulls out a match and lights it. He watches it catch

fire, then grabs his suitcase and walks out of the room. We

hold on the burning standup, as flames lick at Joe's smile.

INT. REHAB CENTER - AFTERNOON

Joe is shown into his room. Bare. One cot. One dresser. He

drops his bag, sags onto the bed.

INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY

A tired and depressed group of E.S.U. football players undress

after practice. Bud and Alvin sit in their pads, Lattimer

standing in street clothes. Bud softly sings "Don't Cry For

Me Argentina."

EXT. WOLF DEN STADIUM - DAY

Winters and Galen Howard are walking across the field after

practice. The stadium is deserted.

Howard walks away, pissed off, leaving Winters alone in the

middle of the field.

INT. BOARD OF REGENTS HEARING ROOM - DAY

The seven members of the BOARD OF REGENTS sit on one side of

a long rectangular table, the Chairman in the middle. On the

other side are coach Winters, Bobby Collins, the President

of the Faculty Senate, EDWARD LEARNIHAN, Academic Advisor,

ARTHUR SHANE, President of the Student Body, RICHARD FOWLER,

and Galen Howard. Fowler is addressing the board.

Winters could kill this kid.

Winters rises, sweating, less from nervousness than from the

odious nature of what he has to do.

Winters would rather cut off his own head with a razor blade.

Bobby Collins breaks into a wide, triumphant smile.

EXT. ADMINISTRATION BUILDING - DAY

Learnihan and Winters come down the steps, their faces set.

As they split off:

INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY

Bobby Collins walks in prior to practice. His teammates gather

round, slap him on the back, high five etc. Winters watches

from his office, disgusted.

INT. COACH WINTER'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Coach Winters is in his video alcove watching footage of his

upcoming opponent -- it's like he's looking through it though,

his mind elsewhere, something boiling up inside him. Suddenly,

he smashes his fist into the screen, breaking it into pieces.

His hand bleeds. He doesn't care. He just sits there and

seethes.

INT. CAMILLE'S ROOM - DAY

Camille's on the phone.

INT. JOE'S ROOM IN REHAB CENTER - DAY

Joe is aimlessly flipping cards toward a wastebasket. A NURSE

knocks on his door.

Joe says nothing, not wanting to deal with this.

The nurse leaves. Joe gets up, goes to the wall, and starts

pounding it with his right hand.

INT. CAMILLE'S ROOM - DAY

Crushed and angry, Camille hangs up.

INT. ATHLETIC DORM HALL - DAY

Bud Lite is watching television. Louanne enters on her way

to Bobby Collins' room, carrying an armload of neatly-pressed

laundry. But Lite gets up to bar her way.

Bud just nods blankly. Louanne starts to head for Bobby's

room.

Bud doesn't have the heart to tell her. She finally realizes

Bobby's with another girl.

Bud nods. Louanne, fighting back tears, walks back down the

hall with as much dignity as she can muster.

INT. JOE'S REHAB CENTER - DAY

Winters comes to the door, hesitates, walks in and finds Joe

huddled on his bed. Shivering.

Joe looks resentful but makes an effort and sits up.

Joe gets unsteadily to his feet. He feels sick. Winters

reaches out to shake hands. Joe does not reciprocate. Hides

his right hand behind his body.

Joe doesn't move.

Joe is angry but he doesn't want to do anything about it.

Joe shakes his head.

Joe sinks to his knees. Winters stares down at him, then

kneels also, his own anger and frustration draining away.

Joe reveals his hand. It's barked and cut, but not badly

swollen.

INT. STEVE LATTIMER'S ROOM - NIGHT

Lattimer fills a bag with all his steroid paraphernalia. He

carries it to his bathroom where he slowly empties it into

his toilet. Syringes, vials and bottles of pills all tumble

into the water. He flushes.

INT. JOE'S ROOM IN REHAB CENTER - MORNING

The sun shines through the window. Joe wakes up, raises up,

looks over at Winters who is asleep in a chair. Winters

rouses. Joe gives him a little smile, he's allright. Winters

gives him a nod of approval.

MUSIC UP. BEGIN A SERIES OF SHOTS

detailing the Timberwolves progress over the next four games.

ON FIELD

1) Players shaking hands at midfield after the game. The

scoreboard reads E.S.U. 14 Boston College 10.

INT. STUDY HALL

2) Darnell in study hall, with his new tutor concentrating

on her explanation, applying himself.

ON SIDELINE - DAY

3) Steve Lattimer, in street clothes, paces the sidelines,

jumping up and down in frustration, his hamstring bandaged

to sell the injury ruse. He catches himself, gets back on

his crutches. A newspaper fades up through the shot. It reads

"Wolves Offense Fires Blanks in 13-0 Loss to Texas."

INT. CAFE - NIGHT

4) Darnell sits in a cafe, drinking coffee and studying. Ray

comes in, his arm around a co-ed, MONICA. They buy a pastry

and leave, not having seen Darnell. Darnell ponders this a

second, goes back to studying.

INT. REHAB CENTER - DAY

5) A group of patients is gathered around a T.V. set in the

Rehab Center, watching a pre-game show. One goes to Joe's

room, where Joe's lying on his cot.

6) Sportscaster DALLAS PERRY is holding forth on the local

evening news.

EXT. CAMPUS NIGHT

7) Darnell, with his books, on the way to the library, passes

INT. LIBRARY - LATE NIGHT

8) Darnell, alone in the library, late at night, studying.

INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY

9) Lattimer, carrying his gear bag, walks into the locker

room. His teammates come over to shake his hand, slap him on

the back, welcome him back to the team.

MUSIC ENDS

INT. JOE'S REHAB CENTER ROOM - NIGHT

Joe sits on his bed listening to the E.S.U. broadcast.

EXT. KINNICK STADIUM - NIGHT

The E.S.U. defense is on the field. Alvin moves up opposite

the OFFENSIVE GUARD.

The ball is hiked. Iowa runs a sweep left. Lattimer tries to

get outside to contain, but is blocked by the fullback, who

goes low and cuts his legs out from under him.

Alvin pursues the play as the ballcarrier heads for the

corner, then suddenly cuts back. Alvin has overrun the play

slightly. We go to SLOW MOTION as he turns and is hit with a

wicked CRACK-BACK BLOCK by the guard he taunted. Alvin's leg

flexes at a horrifying angle. We HEAR THE SNAP of bone and

tendon, as Alvin plummets to the ground, writhing in pain,

grabbing his left leg.

The doctor and trainers sprint out to the field.

INT. JOE'S REHAB CENTER ROOM - NIGHT

We move in on Joe's face, as Harvey is heard on the radio in

the b.g.

Joe's eyes close. He knows what this means.

EXT. THE FIELD - NIGHT

Alvin is being strapped on the stretcher.

EXT. KINNICK STADIUM - NIGHT

An ambulance carrying Alvin emerges from the stadium. We

hear CHEERING inside, the SIREN outside.

EXT. THE FIELD AGAIN - NIGHT

The E.S.U. defensive line digs in. Lattimer tries to suck up

his remaining strength.

Iowa runs a blast to Lattimer's side. He fights through one

block, the ballcarrier coming right toward him. They meet in

a titanic collision at the goal line. The back keeps driving,

twisting. Lattimer tries to hold him, but weaker than he was

on steroids, is unable to. The back falls over the goal line.

Touchdown. IOWA 13 E.S.U. 10.

As the Iowa players celebrate all around him, Lattimer sits

where he fell, a beaten and humiliated young man.

INT. INTERVIEW ROOM UNDER STADIUM - NIGHT

Coach Winters faces the press.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - EVENING

Alvin lies on a bed, his leg bandaged and elevated. He's

still a little groggy from anesthetic. Coach Winters stands

beside him.

Several beats of silence. Then:

Alvin nods. Winters comes forward, hugs him around the head,

gives him a smile, walks out. Tears brim in Winters eyes as

he leaves. Alvin's head goes back against the pillow. Tears

aren't brimming here. They're rolling down his cheeks.

MUSIC BEGINS

EXT. REHAB CENTER - MORNING

Joe walks out with his suitcase. Coach Winters waits for

him. Shakes his hand. They get in the car.

INT. CAR - DAY

They share a laugh. Winters pulls out two sets of round trip

airline tickets.

Joe takes the tickets, just looks at him.

INT. STEVE LATTIMER'S ROOM - NIGHT

Lattimer hangs up, picks up a HYPODERMIC. Stares at it a

second, sweat beading on his forehead. Then plunges it an

inch deep into his thigh. Pulls it out, sits on the bed a

beat, then picks up a barbell and begins to pump it furiously,

biceps bulging.

MUSIC ENDS

INT. COACH WINTER'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON

The coach is facing Ray and Darnell across his desk.

Ray is stunned, Darnell elated, but neither says a word.

EXT. TENNIS COURTS - DAY

Camille comes off the court, after tennis practice. She's

surprised to find Joe waiting for her.

She starts to walk away, heading for the bike racks.

Camille gets on her bike...

and pedals off.

She just keeps on going.

EXT. PENNSYLVANIA STEEL TOWN - DAY

A bus comes up the hill toward us, on the main street of

Joe's sooty, little home town, the huge stacks of moribund

steel works filling the sky in the background. The bus stops

at a corner. Joe steps off. No bag. He's not planning on

staying long.

EXT. JOE'S HOUSE - DAY

Joe goes to the front door. Knocks, gets no answer, pushes

the door open, walks through the messy, cluttered house to

the back porch. Seated in a metal folding chair, smoking a

cigarette, looking out at the yard is Joe's DAD. He's got a

couple days growth of beard, and although not drunk now, he

has the look of one.

Joe nods sadly.

They give each other a short, quick hug. Nothing sentimental.

Joe walks back through the house. His dad stares out at the

yard.

INT. COLLEGE LIBRARY - NIGHT

Darnell is up late again, studying at one of the tables. He

hears footsteps, becomes aware of the presence of another

person. He looks up to see Autumn.

Silence. Darnell looks back at his books.

Darnell gets up and pulls her to her feet. He hugs her.

MUSIC BEGINS

INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - AFTERNOON

Darnell is bent over his test booklet. He writes furiously,

stops to think, starts writing again.

EXT. PRACTICE FIELD - DAY

Joe takes a snap, fades to pass, throws an out. The ball

flutters badly, falling short.

The players, surprised at this turn of events, begin to file

off. Even the coaches are baffled. Winters walks over to

Joe, who has no idea what this is about.

ANGLE ON JOE - STADIUM

Hopping up the stadium steps on his right foot, laboring as

he passes Winters, halfway up.

Joe switches to his left foot and continues hopping up the

steps, his quadriceps bursting with pain.

JOE - LATER - STADIUM

hanging by his arms, moving hand over hand along the crossbar

of the goalpost, panting with fatigue, Winters watching from

below.

JOE - AT SUNSET - STADIUM

Bone weary now. Winters has him run 20 yards, get down and

do 10 pushups, run another 20 yards, do 10 more pushups etc.

Joe staggers the 20 yards, drops to do his pushups, can only

do 4. Winters yanks him to his feet, pushes him forward to

run again.

Winters pushes Joe down to do his pushups. Joe has to strain

mightily to do two.

Joe tries to get up, but collapses face down on the turf, as

Winters continues to walk away.

INT. LOW RENT DOCTOR'S OFFICE - MORNING

Lattimer lies on a table, a CATHETER TUBE going into his

side. A DOCTOR'S AIDE supervises. Lattimer's dealer is there.

INT. LOCKER ROOM - BEFORE THE GAME

Coach Winters watches unknowingly as Lattimer pees the

catheterized urine into a cup.

MUSIC ENDS

INT. LOCKER ROOM - JUST BEFORE THE GAME

The team is gathered around. Conspicuous among them is

Lattimer, who's painted his face like a skeleton. Coach

Winters is whipping them up with a pre-game rant.

Pumped to the gills, the E.S.U. team explodes in yells and

races out into the tunnel. The YELLING continues OVER and

mixes with the CHEERING OF THE CROWD as:

EXT. WOLF DEN STADIUM - AFTERNOON

ANGLE ON BOBBY COLLINS in the huddle.

They break and the E.S.U. offense comes to the line. Collins

calls signals. We go to SLOW MOTION as he fades to pass.

Darnell fakes a block, then rolls out for a screen pass.

Georgia Tech's defensive line comes hard. Bobby flips the

ball over the charging defenders. Darnell catches it, gets a

good block from Bud Lite, then tucks in behind Ray who is

out ahead blocking.

There's only one linebacker to beat and Darnell will be into

the secondary. Figuring Ray will block the guy, Darnell begins

to look for the safeties. Ray, however, barely brushes the

linebacker, who doesn't even break stride. He lowers his

head, and drives into Darnell, his helmet hitting the

football. Fumble! There's a scramble. The Yellow Jackets

free safety comes up with it.

REGULAR SPEED

The crowd and the E.S.U. bench, quickly deflated, sit back

down. Darnell gets to his feet, glares at Ray, but says

nothing. He knows Ray tanked the block.

INT. ALVIN MACK'S SHACK - DAY

Alvin sits alone in the "living room", listening to the E.S.U.

game on the radio, his leg propped up on an apple crate. His

mother mends a pair of jeans in the b.g.

Alvin's mother looks to see if there's any reaction from

Alvin. There's none.

EXT. WOLF DEN STADIUM - AFTERNOON

Bobby Collins fades back to pass, is rushed, throws a quick

sideline, but it's a little short. The Yellow Jackets'

CORNERBACK sprints up, intercepts it and runs 30 yards down

the sideline for a touchdown.

INT. E.S.U. LOCKER ROOM - AFTERNOON

A discouraged bunch of E.S.U. players drag into the locker

room. Some swear, some bang their lockers.

Darnell marches over to Ray's locker.

Infuriated, Darnell goes for Ray, and they start swinging.

Darnell tackles Ray, they roll on the floor, still swinging,

trying to beat the shit out of each other. Finally, several

players manage to pull them apart. Coach Winters charges

over.

Winters walks over to a table set up with 75 cups of Orange

Juice and Gatorade. He swipes the cups off the table creating

a small flood on the floor. Then turns the table over. The

players are shocked. They've seldom seen him like this.

Winters walks away, as the players are left to contemplate

their mistakes. Winters goes over to Joe.

Joe nods, excited but uncertain. Winters moves on to Ray

Griffen.

EXT. WOLF DEN STADIUM - AFTERNOON

The E.S.U. players return to their bench for the start of

the second half, gather in a circle. Joe looks up in the

stands to the seat he reserved for his father. It's empty.

BEGIN A SERIES OF SHOTS:

1) Joe takes the snap from center, fumbles it, falls on it.

2) Joe looks to throw over the middle, waits too long, is

sacked.

3) Joe underthrows Darnell coming out of the backfield.

EXT. WOLF DEN STADIUM - AFTERNOON

Clayton approaches Winters on the sideline.

ANGLE ON JOE

As he starts off the bench for the field, Coach Winters comes

up to him.

ANGLE ON THE E.S.U. OFFENSIVE HUDDLE

As Joe comes into the huddle. He's all business now.

Joe brings the offense to the line of scrimmage, yells "Go!"

The ball is snapped, Joe drops back, hits Darnell on the

sideline. First down. In quick succession, we see Joe:

1) Complete a 15 yarder to Ray over the middle.

2) Fades to pass, is rushed. Forced out of the pocket,

scrambles for his life, manages to get down to the 4 yard

line. He gets up, surveys the distance to pay dirt.

ANGLE ON THE SIDELINE

Winters puts his arm around Ray who will take the play into

the huddle.

Winters gives Ray a shove and he runs onto the field. Ray is

upset, angry. He swears to himself.

ANGLE ON FIELD

Ray enters the huddle, whispers in Joe's ear.

The team breaks out, comes to the line. Joe looks over the

defense, screams signals as the CROWD NOISE is building.

We go to SLOW MOTION as the ball is snapped. Ray takes one

step forward then turns right, leading the play. Joe pitches

to Darnell who follows Ray. Georgia Tech's outside linebacker

comes up to stop the play. Ray stumbles before he can make

the block. He drops out of our picture.

Darnell is forced to go wider toward the sideline. The

linebacker and cornerback are closing, both have the angle

on him. Darnell starts to cut back. He lowers his shoulder

to take the linebacker's blow. Suddenly, out of nowhere, Ray

reappears and throws a devastating block on the linebacker,

knocking him back into the cornerback, taking them both out.

Darnell cuts it up and blasts over the safety at the goal

line. Touchdown, E.S.U.

The stands erupt. It's the first thing they've had to cheer

about all day. Winters just looks at the clock, goes over to

talk to his defense.

Darnell foregoes his touchdown dance. He runs over to Ray,

grabs him by the helmet.

Ray smiles. They butt heads and run off the field

INT. ALVIN'S SHACK

EXT. WOLF DEN STADIUM - AFTERNOON

Georgia Tech has the ball. They break their huddle.

The Georgia Tech quarterback fakes to his fullback, hands

off to his TAILBACK on the countertrap. The tailback runs

behind his big, pulling tackle, both right at Lattimer.

Lattimer takes on the tackle, sheds his block. The back lowers

his head, starts to power into Lattimer. Lattimer lets out a

fierce yell.

Smash! Lattimer explodes into the tailback, the collision

lifting the back off the ground, whiplashing his neck,

vibrating his helmet. Lattimer's legs churn, driving the

tailback back and into the ground. We see the back's face.

There are snot bubbles in his nose. No first down. No way.

Lattimer jabs both arms in the air. The crowd goes nuts, as

the defense slaps helmets, and runs off the field, windmilling

their arms, whipping up the crowd.

ANGLE ON SIDELINE

Winters congratulates the defense as it comes off the field.

He meets Lattimer, looks into his eyes. Sees the steroids

there. He knows it's the only way the kid could have done

it. Decides not to bust him. Lattimer knows it. Winters gives

his helmet a little slap, more in sympathy than praise.

ANGLE ON THE YELLOW JACKET PUNTER

He catches the snap, boots the ball away.

Darnell fields it at his 12, starts toward the right sideline,

where hemmed in, he looks like dead meat. Suddenly, he

reverses his field, racing for the opposite sideline, where

a picket line of blockers awaits him, if he can get there.

He turns on the jets, barely beating two tacklers to the

corner, and then turns it up the left sideline, picking up a

wicked series of crack-back blocks, until he's finally run

out of bounds at the Yellow Jacket 35 yard line.

ON STANDS

The E.S.U. fans are on their feet. Winters races over to

Joe.

INT. WOLF DEN STADIUM - AFTERNOON

Joe brings the Wolves up.

Joe takes the snap, drops to pass, finds no one, rolls away

from the rush. Just as he's about to go out of bounds, he

fires a bullet down the sideline. Ray Griffen catches it and

goes out of bounds at the twelve.

ANGLE ON SIDELINE

Joe runs over to Coach Winters, knowing they have no more

time outs, as the refs move the chains.

ON FIELD

Joe races back out onto the field and into the huddle, as

the crowd's roar goes off the charts.

He starts the wolf howl. The others join in, howling for all

they're worth, eleven jacked-up warriors. They clap and break

the huddle.

The crowd is standing, waving fists in unison toward the

Georgia Tech end zone. Joe looks up in the stands again at

the seat he left for his father. It's still empty.

Joe starts to call signals as Bud Lite sings "Bali Hi." We

go to SLOW MOTION as the ball is snapped.

The Georgia Tech defense fires off the line, throwing

everything at Joe. Joe drops back five steps. Bud Lite picks

up a blitzing linebacker, knocks him over a fallen player.

Joe looks for Darnell in the corner, but another pass rusher

breaks through, forcing Joe out of the pocket. It's wartime

as tackles and blockers collide, hand-fight, go down, scramble

up, collide again, all in pursuit of Joe.

Darnell, realizing Joe's in trouble, breaks off his pattern

and heads to the center of the end zone. Joe dodges one

tackler, shakes free of another's ankle tackle, heads back

for the center of the field. He spots Darnell breaking between

defensive backs. Just as he's buried by two massive linemen,

Joe fires a rocket down the middle toward the sliver of open

space that Darnell is heading for.

The ball barely clears the hands of a lunging linebacker.

Darnell and two defensive backs, one from each side, close

on the ball as it cuts through the air, a perfect spiral.

Darnell dives. The two defensive backs dive. The ball passes

between their outstretched hands by a fraction of an inch,

landing in Darnell's. He clutches it to his chest, rolls

over, holds the ball up for the ref to see. Touchdown! This

time Darnell does go into his touchdown dance.

ANGLE ON STANDS

Pandemonium. The crowd including Autumn and her dad goes

crazy. Winters just gives a few quick nods, watching almost

wistfully as the players and coaches hug each other, knowing

none of them will hug him. Joe, Bud and the others mob

Darnell.

INT. ALVIN'S SHACK - DAY

Alvin listens to the celebration a few beats, then switches

off the radio, knowing this is an experience he'll never be

a part of again. We leave him staring off into an uncertain

future.

INT. CHANCELLOR'S SKY-BOX - DAY

The Chancellor and his guests are celebrating the victory,

congratulating each other. Conspicuous among them are the

Fat Cat Alumnus who gave Darnell the money, and the Chairman

of the Board of Regents.

The Fat Cat Alumnus goes to a replica of the Building Fund

football field and starts advancing the ball.

This brings applause all around.

EXT. WOLF DEN STADIUM - AFTERNOON

As Darnell comes off the field, Autumn runs out and hugs

him, leads him to her dad.

Darnell reaches into his helmet and takes out a sweat-stained

piece of paper.

ANGLE ON JOE KANE

walking toward the tunnel, acknowledging the plaudits of the

fans. He looks for Camille, doesn't see her. Coach Winters

comes up next to him.

Winters gives him a quick, but firm hug.

Joe manages a weary smile.

ANGLE ON BUD LITE

coming down the tunnel, Bobby Collins next to him. Both stop

as Louanne walks toward them. Bobby smiles to himself in

anticipation of her fawning over him. She walks right by him

and up to Bud.

Bud smiles. Bobby quickly looks around for someone else to

hit on, hails a cheerleader. Bud and Louanne walk off

together. Louanne stops when she sees her father, fearful of

his reaction.

Louanne waits, not sure whether her father's angry or not.

Louanne smiles. Winters returns it, and walks away.

ANGLE ON STEVE LATTIMER

Sitting on the bench, his head in his hands, weeping.

These are not tears of joy, but a man/boy who knows he'll

never be able to play pro football without steroids.

EXT. E.S.U. CAMPUS - LATE AFTERNOON

Joe sits on a bench at the intersection of four converging

Quad paths. Camille approaches from the opposite direction,

stops when she sees Joe.

This softens, relaxes her a bit.

Camille's shocked that he might be drinking again. He pulls

a six pack of 7-Up out from behind his back. She laughs in

spite of herself. They settle again.

They look at each other a beat, come forward into a long

kiss and embrace as we pull up and back.

CREDITS BEGIN TO ROLL AS

EXT. STADIUM TUNNEL - DAY

Coach Winters, flanked by Humes and Clayton, walks down the

tunnel to a waiting car. No effigy this time.

They continue down the tunnel toward a new recruiting season,

another year in the annals of The Program.
