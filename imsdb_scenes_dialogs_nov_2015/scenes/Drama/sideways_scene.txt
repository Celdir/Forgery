UNDER THE STUDIO LOGO:

KNOCKING at a door and distant dog BARKING.

NOW UNDER BLACK, a CARD --

The rapping, at first tentative and polite, grows insistent.

Then we hear someone get out of bed.

A DOOR is opened, and the black gives way to BLINDING WHITE

LIGHT, the way one experiences the first glimpse of day amid,

say, a hangover.

A WORKER is there.

He closes the door with a SLAM.

EXT. MILES'S APARTMENT COMPLEX - DAY

SUPERIMPOSE --

Wearing only underwear, a bathrobe and clogs, MILES RAYMOND

comes out of his unit and heads toward the street. He passes

some SIX MEXICANS waiting to work.

He climbs into his twelve-year-old CONVERTIBLE SAAB, parked

far from the curb and blocking part of the driveway. The car

starts fitfully.

As he pulls away, the guys begin backing up the truck.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Miles rounds the corner and finds a new parking spot.

INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

He cuts the engine, exhales a long breath and brings his

hands to his head in a gesture of headache pain or just

anguish. He leans back in his seat, closes his eyes, and

soon NODS OFF.

INT. MILES'S APARTMENT - DAY

The door bursts open. Miles runs into the kitchen, looking

just past camera.

WHIP PAN TO --

THE MICROWAVE CLOCK that reads 10:50.

ON THE PHONE --

Miles hurriedly throws clothes into a suitcase.

INT. MILES'S BATHROOM - DAY

ON THE TOILET --

Miles has a BOOK propped open on his knees. He turns a page,

lost in his reading.

LATER --

Miles SHOWERS.

IN THE MIRROR --

Miles FLOSSES.

INT. COFFEE HOUSE - DAY

Miles finally makes it to the front of the line.

EXT. 5 FREEWAY ENTRANCE RAMP - DAY

Miles's Saab chugs up the ramp and merges.

INSERT - NEW YORK TIMES CROSSWORD PUZZLE --

-- pressed against the STEERING WHEEL. The puzzle is about

1/3 finished.

EXT. 5 FREEWAY - DAY

As though from an adjacent car, we see Miles driving while

carefully filling in an answer.

INT./EXT. SAAB - DAY

THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD --

A SIGN reads:

PAN TO MILES as he signals to change lanes. The finished

puzzle lies on the passenger seat.

EXT. PALOS VERDES STREET - DAY

The houses on this block are blandly palatial as in so many

affluent Southern California suburbs.

Miles's car pull into the driveway behind an older BMW and

two LEXI. He gets out and trots toward the front door.

INT. ERGANIAN HOUSE - DAY

A GIANT PROJECTION TV --

In a large split-level living room displays a GOLF TOURNAMENT.

WIDE --

Watching from the ultra-comfortable furniture are MIKE

ERGANIAN, a tanned, silver-haired real estate caudillo; bride-

to-be CHRISTINE ERGANIAN, his oldest daughter; and JACK

LOPATE, wearing bowling shirt, shorts and flip-flops.

MRS. ERGANIAN, a warm and elegant housewife, shows Miles

into the room.

Mr. Erganian and Jack get to their feet and shake hands with

Miles. Jack remains affable, but we can discern his genuine

irritation.

The Erganians laugh. Miles works up a smile too.

More lame laughter.

Although Mr. Erganian presses MUTE on the remote, he keeps

watching for an extended moment, as do Jack and Miles.

INT. ERGANIAN KITCHEN - DAY

Jack and the Erganians surround Miles as he eats from a plate

with two pieces of CAKE -- one white, one dark.

Miles shoots Jack a look. Mr. Erganian gets some ice cubes

from the refrigerator door.

INT. SAAB - CONTINUOUS

IN A REAR VIEW MIRROR --

The Erganians wave good-bye.

INSIDE THE CAR --

Miles accelerates as he and Jack wave back.

Jack turns around, and starts rooting around in a CARDBOARD

WINE BOX.

Jack sits back in his seat holding up a bottle of CHAMPAGNE

and TWO GLASSES.

Jack now begins to remove the foil from the champagne bottle.

Jack untwists the wire. Instantly the cork pops off, and a

fountain of champagne erupts.

Jack begins pouring two glasses.

They clink and drink.

EXT. FREEWAY - DAY

The Saab heads north.

INT. SAAB - DAY

The boys continue to drink and drive.

INT. GAS STATION #1 - DAY

Miles is pumping gas. Jack is stretching his legs nearby or

perhaps cleaning the windshield.

A CELLPHONE RINGS. Jack reaches into his pocket.

Christine's voice is so loud that Jack has to hold the phone

away from his ear.

A silence, then --

Jack looks at Miles in a mute appeal for sympathy.

Jack hasn't even really heard the question.

As the conversation continues, Miles replaces the GAS PUMP,

screws the GAS CAP back on, and together the guys get back

into the car. We DRIVE AWAY WITH THEM.

A silence. Then --

Jack SLAMS his cellphone shut, momentarily blinded with rage.

EXT. 405 FREEWAY - LATE AFTERNOON

The Saab heads north -- now passing through LOS ANGELES.

INT./EXT. SAAB - LATE AFTERNOON

Miles signals and begins to head for an EXIT.

EXT. 101 FREEWAY - LATE AFTERNOON

The Saab takes an EXIT.

OMIT.

OMIT.

EXT. CONDO COMMUNITY STREET - DUSK

The Saab rounds a corner and parks in front of a modest CONDO.

SUPERIMPOSE:

EXT. MILES'S MOTHER'S CONDO - DUSK

Approaching the front door, Miles pulls a BOUQUET OF FLOWERS

out of a plastic grocery store bag. Jack carries a bottle of

CHAMPAGNE.

Miles pulls a BIRTHDAY CARD out of the bag too.

He pulls a PEN from his pocket and signs it. As he licks the

envelope, Jack rings the bell.

Moments later PHYLLIS comes to the door. She is a matronly

older woman in a nightgown and housecoat.

The boys offer up the flowers and champagne. Phyllis slurs

slightly as she speaks -- she's been doing some celebrating

of her own.

They hug.

The boys follow her inside.

INT. MILES'S MOTHER'S CONDO - CONTINUOUS

Jack gives Miles a look.

Miles leads Jack into this small condo. The TV is on, and

it's MESSY. Amid the newspapers and junk mail and dishes, an

AB-ROLLER and an ancient SCHWINN EXER-CYCLE sit forgotten in

a corner.

INT. MILES'S MOTHER'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

Miles finishes twisting ice trays into a MOP BUCKET as it

fills with water in the sink. He puts the champagne in and

carries it into the --

INT. MILES'S MOTHER'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

He takes a seat on the sofa next to Jack, who is watching

WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE?

Miles finishes opening the bottle with an elegant silence.

The boys turn to see Phyllis now dolled up in thick make-up

and a PANTSUIT. Her eyebrows are painted and cock-eyed.

Overall she looks much worse than before.

EXT. MILES'S MOTHER'S LANAI - NIGHT

Miles and Jack are seated in webbed chairs around a circular

glass table. They are mid-meal.

Everyone is more than a little lubricated, especially the

birthday girl as she returns from the kitchen with another

plate of food.

Silence. Jack freezes, his fork halfway to his mouth.

He gets up and heads into the house.

INT. MILES'S APARTMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

Miles heads toward...

INT. MILES'S APARTMENT BEDROOM - NIGHT

...and goes directly to her dresser, opening a drawer filled

with bras, panties and stockings.

He burrows through his mother's lingerie until locating a

CAN OF RAID. A can of Raid?

He twists open the bottom and pulls it apart, revealing it

to be a SECRET STASH for valuables disguised as a common

household product. Inside are stacks of ONE-HUNDRED DOLLAR

BILLS.

His task complete, he closes the drawer, and as he stuffs

the bills in his pocket, his glance falls upon FRAMED PHOTOS

atop the dresser --

-- A proud NINE-YEAR-OLD MILES poses in front of his childhood

San Diego home, showing off a WAGON filled with freshly

harvested lettuce. On the wagon is a hand-lettered sign --

"10 cents a bunch."

-- A Sears portrait shows the RAYMOND FAMILY: a much younger

Phyllis, her husband, and their two children -- a 12-year-

old Miles and seven-year-old Wendy.

-- Miles at his wedding. He and his bride VICTORIA look young

and attractive, their faces radiant and hopeful.

INT. MILES'S APARTMENT BATHROOM - NIGHT

Miles enters, flushes the toilet and leaves.

EXT. MILES'S MOTHER'S LANAI - NIGHT

As Miles slides open the door and takes his seat again, Jack

is pouring Phyllis another glass.

Embarrassed for his friend, Jack just stares at his food.

Miles takes another drink of wine.

UNDER BLACK, a CARD --

INT. MILES'S APARTMENT BEDROOM - DAY

Jack finally awakens with a start and finds Miles standing

above him, shaking him.

WIDE --

As Jack gets up, we see he has crashed on Phyllis's bed

adorned with all her decorative PILLOWS.

INT. MILES'S MOTHER'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Still in her pantsuit and smeared makeup, Phyllis lies

sprawled and snoring on the sofa. On the TV, ostensibly never

turned off the night before, is an inane CARTOON.

As Miles opens the front door, he spots Jack heading toward

the TV to turn it off. Miles waves him off.

As they leave and Miles closes the front door quietly behind

him, we PAN to the flowers still wrapped and forgotten on a

side table.

INT. ROADSIDE IHOP - DAY

TWO PLATES OF FOOD float in front of two breasts tucked inside

a zippered uniform.

WIDER --

Disheveled and unshaven, Jack and Miles are served breakfast

by a young, innocently sexy WAITRESS. Jack leers after her.

They eat in silence a moment.

Miles shrugs off the comment.

Miles concentrates on his eggs and hash browns

Jack spots the waitress coming out of the kitchen and motions

for more coffee. She nods and smiles, indicating she'll be

right over. Jack returns the smile and holds up a hand to

signal he'll wait. Jack turns back to see Miles watching

him.

EXT. CENTRAL COAST - DAY

In a series of shots, the Saab -- now with its TOP DOWN --

makes its way onto the 101 and travels past landmarks that

those familiar with the Santa Barbara area might recognize.

MUSIC accompanies this sequence that anchors us into the

rhythm of a road trip.

INT./EXT. SAAB - DAY

The car now descends the Santa Ynez Mountains and heads toward

Buellton. Miles and Jack must SHOUT to be heard in the open

car.

EXT. SANTA ROSA TURN-OFF - DAY

The Saab passes over the 101 and turns onto SANTA ROSA road.

INT./EXT. SAAB - DAY

The boys now pass vineyards of immaculate grapevines.

Jack looks at Miles, admiring his friend's vast learning and

articulateness.

The Saab now pulls of the road and makes its way down a long

gravel DRIVEWAY.

EXT. SANFORD TASTING ROOM - DAY

Miles brings the car to a stop in the parking lot. As they

get out and walk --

Miles must curb his eagerness to go inside the tasting room

as Jack SPEED DIALS.

Jack listens, then grows suddenly impatient.

Miles just shrugs.

As Jack gets more and more involved with the phone call, he

wanders off across the parking lot, progressively out of

earshot.

And so it goes, Jack's voice rising and falling. Miles decides

to head inside.

INT. SANFORD TASTING ROOM - DAY

Miles is at the bar, TWO GLASSES in front of him. Jack walks

in and bellies up next to him.

CHRIS BURROUGHS, a POURER in a cowboy hat and ponytail, comes

over.

Chris and Jack shake hands.

TWO GLASSES are filled with small amounts of PINOT NOIR VIN

GRIS.

They laugh.

Miles swirls his glass in tight circles on the bar, then

lifts it to smell. Jack clumsily imitates Miles, perhaps

even spilling some wine in the process.

We see details of what Miles now describes.

Jack waves the glass under his nose as if it were a perfume

bottle.

Jack now buries his nose in the glass.

Miles smells.

Jack smells again and begins to brighten.

Miles expertly swirls the wine. Jack follows suit.

They do so. Jack smiles.

Jack gulps his wine down in one shot. Miles chews his before

swallowing.

Now Miles notices something about Jack.

EXT. SOLVANG, CALIFORNIA - DAY

The Saab passes through this Danish-themed tourist town.

SUPERIMPOSE --

EXT. BUELLTON, CALIFORNIA - DAY

The Saab makes its way into this very average-looking Central

coast town right off the freeway.

SUPERIMPOSE --

EXT. WINDMILL INN - DAY

The Saab pulls into the parking lot of this motel. And look --

there's the WINDMILL itself, its decorative blades motionless.

INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

Miles and Jack enter the room and throw their suitcases onto

their respective beds.

LATER --

The sounds of a SHOWER and OFF-KEY SINGING come from the

bathroom while Miles sits impatiently on the bed. He pounds

on the wall.

Opening the bedside drawer, Miles finds a GIDEON'S BIBLE and

tosses it in the trash -- apparently his hotel routine.

EXT. HIGHWAY 246 - DUSK

Freshly showered and dressed for dinner, Miles and Jack amble

along the shoulder of this busy local two-lane highway. They

pass a mall and a car dealership.

Miles leads them away from the road and across a parking

lot. The camera PANS to reveal --

THE HITCHING POST, a local institution.

INT. HITCHING POST BAR - DUSK

Miles and Jack belly up. GARY, the Samoan bartender, spots

Miles and extends a welcoming hand.

Gary pours Jack and Miles a generous sample and the two men

swirl, sniff and taste. Jack is beginning to get the hang of

things.

Gary fills their glasses and corks the bottle. Jack raises

his glass to toast.

They clink their glasses and take a drink. We linger on them

as Miles retreats inward and a restless Jack scans the room.

INT. HITCHING POST DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Jack and Miles review their menus. Jack looks up and spots a

PRETTY WAITRESS placing an order at the bar.

Miles glances at the waitress and returns to his menu.

Jack leans forward and squints.

Just then Maya comes by carrying a tray of food on her way

to another table.

She goes.

Miles focuses again on the menu.

INT. HITCHING POST BAR - NIGHT

TWO BURGUNDY GLASSES --

are refilled with the contents of yet another bottle of

Hitching Post Pinot Noir.

Jack and Miles are enjoying a post-prandial drink.

MILES

Looks like he's thinking about something. Then --

Jack swirls his wine and downs it in one gulp. Just then --

MAYA

Walks into the bar and takes a seat a few stools down. She

has changed into a black cashmere sweater and corduroys,

lovely but tired.

Maya looks over and smiles as Gary pours her a glass from

their bottle.

Maya gets an American Spirit Yellow out of her purse and

lights it while Gary pours her a glass.

In no hurry, she takes a long sip of her wine, gets up and

comes down the bar.

Miles shoots Jack a look. Jack responds with a "don't-fuck-

it-up-brother" glower.

She offers her glass, and all clink.

Jack takes a deep breath, and out comes a perfect VOICE-OVER

VOICE.

Maya's mouth drops open and curves into a big smile.

Jack launches into another one of his sure-fire hits.

This makes Maya laugh a big throaty laugh. Jack joins in.

Nervous about Jack's aggressive flirtatiousness, Miles musters

a tight courtesy smile.

They all take a drink of wine.

Before Jack has a chance to speak --

This makes Maya slightly embarrassed at her apparent

availability, but she recovers quickly, remains breezy.

Maya downs the rest of her wine, stamps out her smoke, and

picks up her jean jacket and purse.

As she leaves --

But she's gone. Jack gives Miles a slow burn look.

EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

The guys walk drunkenly along the shoulder as CARS WHIZ BY.

INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

The screen is absolutely BLACK.

Jack begins to make a soft BUZZING noise, growing gradually

louder and more rhythmic.

There's now a rustling noise and footsteps. Then a LIGHT is

flipped on in the BATHROOM.

Miles closes the door behind him, and the only light visible

is at the bottom of the bathroom door.

Miles PEES -- a series of semi-forced SHORT SQUIRTS. Then a

FLUSH as a door opens and the light goes off. Jack starts

BUZZING again.

Jack stops and Miles climbs into bed. Silence. Then --

UNDER BLACK --

EXT. BREAKFAST CAFE - DAY

Establishing.

INT. BREAKFAST CAFE - DAY

Miles and Jack are glancing at the menus. For some reason

Jack is humorless and grumpy.

Jack sarcastically taps an index finger to his temple.

Jack exhales and looks away, as though he doesn't want to

get into it.

Jack sucks his teeth a moment searching for the right words.

Then the dam bursts.

The older WAITRESS comes over.

EXT. LOVELY HIGHWAY - DAY

The Saab winds along this beautiful road that meanders through

large open vineyards.

INSERT --

A MAP and a MOVING LINE show the boys' route.

INSERT --

GRAPES growing on the vine.

EXT. VINEYARD - DAY

Framed by foreground grapevines, the Saab passes in the

distance.

INT. FOXEN WINERY - DAY

Miles has just downed a taste of red wine.

Just as the pourer turns away toward other TASTERS, Jack

GRABS the bottle and helps himself and Miles to another glass.

They slam back their drinks like tequila.

EXT. LOVELY AREA ON A HILL - DAY

Miles brings the Saab to a stop, and the guys get out. Before

them lies an incredible view of endless vineyards.

Jack nods. Miles looks down at his shoes and draws a long

breath. Then he stiffly gets back in the open car and closes

the door.

Miles continues to stare straight ahead.

Miles turns and locates an open BOTTLE of wine in the back

seat. He uncorks it and begins to swig.

Jack tries unsuccessfully to grab the bottle from Miles, but

Miles bolts out of the car.

A VERY WIDE SHOT --

Pursued by Jack, Miles dashes down the hill, all the while

taking huge swigs from the bottle.

OMIT.

EXT. LOVELY VINEYARD - CONTINUOUS

Miles slows to walk between rows of GRAPEVINES. He polishes

off the bottle and tosses it. A painting Jack catches up

with him in the adjacent grapevine corridor.

Miles's face crumbles as though he were about to cry. Then

he collapses to the ground and closes his eyes tight.

Jack looks around impatiently for a moment. Then he squats

down so he can see Miles underneath the vines.

Miles ignores Jack and focuses on the beautiful RIPE GRAPES

that surround him. They seem to distract him from his pain.

Miles looks up and shakes his head a definitive NO. Jack

can't help but LAUGH.

EXT. KALYRA WINERY PARKING LOT - DAY

The sun hangs low as the Saab pulls into the parking lot,

Jack at the wheel.

INT. KALYRA TASTING ROOM - DAY

The pourer, a brunette in her early thirties, breaks away

from a BORING COUPLE down the bar. This is STEPHANIE.

Stephanie laughs. She apparently likes big good-natured lunks

like Jack.

WHOOMP! Under the bar Jack stomps on Miles's foot. Miles

winces.

Stephanie slides TWO GLASSES in front of them.

She THUMPS the cork off a bottle of Chardonnay.

She pours almost flirtatious amounts.

Jack swirls the wine as though he were by now a sommelier.

They look, they smell, they taste.

Stephanie reaches for another bottle and pours. Jack's eyes

never leave her.

As she turns to reach for the right bottle, Jack winks at

Miles. Miles shakes his head.

She pours each of them a full HALF GLASS.

She notices the boring couple, visibly annoyed that she has

been monopolized.

As she wanders down the bar, Jack turns to Miles, his mouth

wide open.

They glance down the bar at Stepanie. She smiles back.

EXT. KALYRA WINERY PARKING LOT - DAY

Miles is killing time by the car staring at his shoes. He

looks over and sees Jack waddling over from the tasting room

with TWO CASES OF WINE.

Jack puts the cases down and glances back at the building.

Jack puts the wine in the trunk, and they get in the car.

INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

THE TV --

GOLF on ESPN.

MILES AND JACK

sit transfixed, each on his own bed. The curtains are drawn.

Then out of nowhere --

CLOSE ON THE TV --

A guy gets ready to putt. The announcer whispers what an

important moment this is. The guy misses.

FADE TO BLACK.

UNDER BLACK --

The sound of an AEROSOL CAN.

WE OPEN OUR EYES TO SEE --

Jack spraying his feet with some Dr. Scholl's product.

WIDE --

Miles pulls himself out of bed and slouches toward his

suitcase.

Jack does some actor's weird warm-up stretch.

As Miles begins to dig through his suitcase, Jack flips open

his cellphone and speed-dials.

Miles glances as his shoes sitting sadly on the floor.

EXT. LOS OLIVOS - NIGHT

The boys get out of the car and walk along a timbered sidewalk

in this tourist town with wine tasting rooms and gourmet

restaurants.

Miles takes a SMALL BOTTLE from his pocket and rattles it.

Miles quickly POPS A XANAX. Jack gives him a final look in

the eye.

INT. LOS OLIVOS CAFE - NIGHT

The boys enter this cozy if crowded restaurant and exchange

words with the HOSTESS. Then they notice --

MAYA AND STEPHANIE

at a booth waving at them. They look great.

MILES AND JACK

make their way to the table, Jack wearing a broad, confident

SMILE.

AT THE TABLE --

Jack plops down next to Stephanie, while Miles politely eases

in on Maya's side. Jack touches a hand to Stephanie's bare

neck and massages it meaningfully.

Meanwhile Miles looks over at Maya and purses his lips in an

affable if uncomfortable smile. Then --

As Miles swirls the wine and takes a sip, he begins to relax.

LATER --

A WAITER finishes listing off the specials.

The four diners exchange looks of delight.

Miles raises his hand and takes the leather-bound book.

Jack glares at Miles, who immediately gets the hint.

Jack smiles and nods his approval. Jack takes the book out

of Miles's hands and offers it to the girls.

Miles draws a long breath.

Jack shoots Miles a look.

Stephanie lowers the menu so that only her eyes peer over

the top. She looks at the others, and they look back at her.

Jack looks at Miles and raises one hand for a HIGH-FIVE.

Miles reluctantly slaps Jack's hand. This causes the girls

to laugh. MUSIC STARTS -- they're OFF!

DINNER is improvised, but includes:

-- The arrival of the FIRST WINE.

-- The SALADS.

-- Maya takes a turn with the wine list. Miles pushes her

finger down into the prices with THREE DIGITS.

-- New stemware is provided with the arrival of the SECOND

WINE.

-- The four of them DRINK. Particularly Miles.

-- Stephanie and Jack get cozier and cozier.

-- The SALMON and DUCK arrive.

-- Miles is too shy to look into Maya's eyes. She's interested

and available -- it's too much for him.

-- As Miles gets DRUNKER, the camera angles become sloppier,

the cutting choppier.

-- Miles PONTIFICATES about some aspect of wine that Maya

and Stephanie find interesting. Left out in the cold, his

jaw tight, Jack wants to find a way in but can't.

-- Miles reaches over to refill his glass, but Jack's arm

shoots out to stop him -- "Slow down."

CLOSE ON MILES as a distant RUMBLE begins to sound, the rumble

of an oncoming ANXIETY ATTACK. By now he has drunk so much

that he spaces out, descending into --

INT. UNDERWORLD - DARK AND TIMELESS

Miles is boarding an OPEN BOAT atop this underground river,

the River Styx. Just beyond a ghoulish HUMAN CARGO the hooded

boatman CHARON wields a long staff. Miles is crossing over

to the dark side.

INT. LOS OLIVOS CAFE - BACK AGAIN

Miles returns to earth to find Jack and Stephanie now in

their own little world -- Jack explaining something to

Stephanie that she finds fascinating, just FASCINATING.

-- Miles converses with Maya, but it's clear from her bemused

expression that he's being charming if not entirely coherent.

-- ANOTHER WINE reaches the table -- a Comte Armand Pornrnard.

-- Miles looks over at Jack and Stephanie. They share a short

but sensual kiss.

MOMENTS LATER --

Miles is on his feet threading his way through the tables.

He is very unsteady, and we cut between first and third person

perspectives.

AT THE BATHROOMS --

He tries the MEN'S ROOM door but it's locked. He pulls the

XANAX out his pocket and pops one in his mouth, swallowing

it dry.

He notices a PAYPHONE nearby. Thinking better of it for a

moment, Miles makes a drunken bee-line for the receiver.

CLOSE ON THE KEYPAD --

as many numbers are dialed, and we HEAR the TONES, completely

out of sync, along with a sound melange of interior phone

RINGING and a PICKUP.

THE RECEIVER --

As Miles presses it desperately to his head.

Miles feigns an implausible upbeat tone.

Miles laughs at his own non-existent joke.

Silence.

Silence.

Miles sucks something from between his two front teeth.

He HANGS UP as nonchalantly as if it had been a sales call

and heads back to the table.

EXT. DEEP CANYON - DAY

For a flash, Miles is walking an unstable, narrow ROPE BRIDGE

extending vertiginously across a great CHASM.

INT. LOS OLIVOS CAFE - BACK AGAIN

Miles reaches the table, tries to sit and SLIPS ONTO THE

FLOOR.

Although at first Jack blinks heavily in disgust, the girls

burst into hysterical LAUGHTER. Jack then laughs too, perhaps

OVER-LAUGHING.

Maya helps him back into the booth.

Miles drinks. Stephanie makes a head gesture to Maya, who

nods in return.

Miles and Jack allow the girls to pass. Then --

Miles reaches for his wine glass, but Jack moves it away.

But in throwing open his arms for emphasis, he spills a WATER

GLASS. Jack rights it and throws a napkin on the tablecloth.

Miles's silence confirms his guilt and shame.

Miles looks down and squeezes his eyes tight while pushing

out an exhale through his nose.

Miles belligerently reaches for his Comte Armand. Jack lets

it pass.

Miles looks at the water, takes it and drains it.

The girls now return to the table. The guys slide over.

Jack raises both arms like a football referee.

INT. SAAB - NIGHT

THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD --

Trees and bushes lit by the headlights show us we're headed

into the woods.

INSIDE --

Jack drives. Miles blinks heavily as he tries to make a sense

of A HAND-DRAWN MAP.

EXT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The Saab pulls into a gravel DRIVEWAY and comes to a stop

outside this wood-framed cottage.

Jack and Miles get out and head for the front door. On the

way, Jack reaches into his coat pocket and produces a string

of FOUR CONDOMS.

Miles wordlessly takes his. Just before they climb the porch

steps --

Jack stops and looks at him for a moment with almost hostile

incredulity.

THE FRONT DOOR is open. Jack knocks twice on the SCREEN DOOR

before going in.

INT. STEPHANIE'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The boys enter this modest living room furnished with

weathered but charming old furniture. Scattered here and

there are CHILDREN'S TOYS. FINGER-PAINTINGS are taped to the

walls. CANDLES are lit, and MUSIC is playing.

Stephanie sails in.

After a brief hug, Stephanie and Jack peck-kiss.

Miles hesitates a moment before Jack elbows him toward --

EXT. STEPHANIE'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Miles wanders in to find Maya squatting in front of a little

temperature-controlled WINE STORAGE UNIT.

Maya slips out a bottle of ESCHEVAUX.

Miles nods vigorously. Maya looks back and forth between

Miles and the wine, her eyes narrowed. Then she slides it

back in.

They rise, and Miles glances at the ANDREW MURRAY SYRAH and,

raising his eyebrows, agrees. Maya begins opening it.

Miles laughs, fights back a bit.

Understanding, Maya considers her response.

Miles whistles and raises his eyebrows. Maya pours, and they

clink their glasses together before savoring the wine.

Then Miles absently scans the REFRIGERATOR DOOR and spots a

PHOTO of Stephanie holding a LITTLE GIRL.

Jack's voice-over voice from the other room...

...is followed by PEALS OF LAUGHTER.

Maya nods as she sips again, looking distant for a moment,

thinking about something else.

Maya takes the bottle, and they wander into --

INT. STEPHANIE'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Jack and Stephanie are gone. From a distant bedroom comes

more laughter.

While Maya goes to turn down the STEREO, Miles sits on the

couch. Maya's shirt rides up as she crouches, giving Miles a

glimpse of the small of HER BACK.

She takes a seat opposite Miles on the couch. They look at

each other without speaking. Just what is the vibe here?

An awkward silence, broken by Maya.

Miles laughs at first, then smiles wistfully at the question.

He searches for the answer in his glass and begins slowly.

Maya has found this answer revealing and moving.

Miles laughs.

Now it is Miles's turn to be swept away. Maya's face tells

us the moment is right, but Miles remains frozen. He needs

another sign, and Maya is bold enough to offer it: reaches

out and places one hand atop his.

Miles gets up and walks out. Maya sighs and gets and American

Spirit out of her purse.

INT. STEPHANIE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

The bathroom's a MESS -- the shower curtain is filthy, and

the chipped and water-stained tub is filled with CHILDREN'S

BATH TOYS.

Miles is bent over the sink splashing water on his face,

trying to sober up and gather his courage. He stands, and

without drying his face, presses his palms against his cheeks.

Then he takes a deep breath and drops his hands.

INT. THE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Miles comes out of the bathroom and looks for Maya, but she's

not there.

Then he hears a noise from the kitchen, so he goes through

the door into --

INT. STEPHANIE'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Maya is at the sink, filling a glass with water.

Miles goes to stand by her and accepts a glass of water.

Just as she's about to fill a second glass, he stops her and

looks her in the eye, trying to recapture a moment that is

long gone.

He kisses her and she kisses back, but the whole thing feels

strained and awkward.

After a few seconds, Maya breaks away.

But instead of resuming the kiss, she steps past him, heading

back into the living room.

Miles realizes he's blown it and silently berates himself.

INT. SAAB - NIGHT

Miles drives down the hill behind Maya's car, which leads

him through this very rural road.

EXT. WHERE THE ROAD MEETS THE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

Maya's car comes to a stop just ahead of the Saab. She puts

it in PARK and gets out.

AT THE SAAB --

Miles rolls down his window as Maya leans over.

Miles turns to the backseat, locates a large MANUSCRIPT BOX,

and hands it to Maya.

He turns around again, produces a SECOND BOX, and hands it

over as well.

She gives him a friendly peck on the cheek.

After she gets back in her car, she heads in one direction

while Miles heads in the opposite.

OMIT.

UNDER BLACK --

Jack's cellphone RINGS.

INT. MOTEL ROOM - MORNING

NOW EARLY MORNING --

Still fully clothed, Miles staggers across the room.

Fishing the phone out of Jack's windbreaker pocket, he looks

at the CALLER ID: "Erganian, Christine" and the number. He

briefly considers his options -- answer it? shut it off? --

before placing it atop Jack's suitcase.

The moment he lies back down on the bed, the MOTEL PHONE

RINGS. An old DIGITAL CLOCK next to it reads 7:l0.

As Miles closes his eyes and pulls the pillow over his aching

head, we again --

FADE TO BLACK.

LATER --

VROOM! Outside a roaring MOTORCYCLE comes to a stop. Then

over the sound of an IDLING ENGINE come familiar if indistinct

VOICES and LAUGHTER.

Miles opens his bleary eyes and listens.

FOOTSTEPS pound on the balcony outside, and Jack lets himself

in, flushed and exuberant.

He pounds on the wall, then goes into the bathroom and without

closing the door unzips his pants to PEE.

A hungover Miles gets up and looks out the door Jack has

left open. Down in the parking lot he sees --

STEPHANIE

atop a mid-sized MOTORCYCLE, wearing a weathered fringed

suede jacket. She gives him a big friendly wave.

MILES

returns the wave and goes back inside.

With a FLUSH Jack emerges from the bathroom and opens his

bag.

Miles looks down. Jack heads for the door.

Jack stops, eyeing Miles suspiciously. Miles tosses Jack his

phone. Jack flips it open and scrolls down with his thumb.

He doesn't like what he sees.

He SNAPS the phone shut and puts it back.

Jack picks up his phone, sits on the bed and looks defiantly

at Miles.

Now Jack closes his eyes and brings the heel of his hand to

his forehead as he begins to concoct the BIG LIE.

EXT. WINDMILL INN - DAY

Miles wanders out and looks down at Stephanie.

Miles says nothing.

Stephanie cuts her bike's engine and climbs off, propping it

up on the kickstand.

Just then Jack cracks open the motel room door.

Miles ducks back inside.

INT. MOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Miles reaches into his wallet and hands over the little foil

square.

EXT. WINDMILL INN - CONTINUOUS

Jack bounds out of the room and down the stairs like a child

on Christmas morning.

Miles watches Jack climb on the bike behind Stephanie,

grasping her waist.

Stephanie and Jack PEEL OUT, leaving Miles alone on the

balcony.

CLOSE ON MILES --

As we begin to hear a SNIPPING sound which carries us to --

EXT. MOTEL ROOM BALCONY - DAY

Miles sits outside carefully trimming his toenails. SNIP,

SNIP, SNIP. MUSIC BEGINS for this mournful montage of

solitude.

INT. MOTEL LOBBY - DAY

Miles takes a styrofoam cup and helps himself to a cup of

complimentary COFFEE from a PUMP THERMOS.

Then he takes a look at the rack of pamphlets of local TOURIST

ATTRACTIONS -- a water park, a mystery cave, and of course

winery after winery.

EXT. WINDMILL INN JACUZZI - DAY

Amid turbulent water, Miles corrects his students' papers.

He is alone in the tub, but at the nearby pool STOCKY KIDS

play noisily with SUPER-SOAKERS.

OVER MILES'S SHOULDER --

The PAPER he's reading is marked up with circled spelling

errors, and one entire paragraph has been crossed out. Finding

a new error, Miles writes "NO!!!"

CAMERA PANS to reveal a STACK of papers already heavily marked

with corrections, some of them mottled with water stains.

INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

Miles FLOSSES, his lips pulled back into a grotesque moue.

Then he brushes with a SONIC-CARE TOOTHBRUSH.

LATER --

Miles checks his machine.

He hangs up, disgusted.

EXT. CHINA PANDA RESTAURANT - DAY

A small Buellton eatery.

INT. CHINA PANDA - DAY

The only customer right now, Miles eats awkwardly with his

chopsticks.

EXT. DRIVING RANGE - DAY

Miles DRIVES ball after ball, unsuccessfully trying to release

his frustration.

EXT. BUCOLIC ROAD - DAY

The Saab roars past us, perhaps going a little too fast.

INT. SAAB - CONTINUOUS

Whistling absently as he drives, Miles leans over to turn

the radio on and fiddle around to find a good station. Then

all of a sudden --

WHUMP! The car has struck something with a hideous sound

followed immediately by the receding "ARF-ARF-ARF-ARF" of an

injured DOG in the Saab's wake. Miles applies the BRAKES.

EXT. BUCOLIC ROAD - DAY

Miles gets out of his car just in time to see --

A DOG

scampering into the nearby woods. Miles looks around -- has

anyone seen him? Is there a nearby residence? Finding nothing,

Miles momentarily weighs his options before finally GIVING

CHASE.

He follows the path of the dog into --

EXT. ROADSIDE WOODS - CONTINUOUS

Still hearing occasional distant barking, Miles finds his

way among the trees and bushes, looking in vain for the ill-

fated cur.

After a frenetic search, Miles reluctantly gives up and heads

back.

OMIT.

EXT. BUCOLIC ROAD - DAY

Miles has returned to where he hit the dog. Just then, Miles

notices TWO MEXICAN CHILDREN watching him from just down the

road. They disappear into the bushes.

Looking like a criminal, Miles trots back to the Saab climbs

behind the wheel and speeds away.

EXT. WINDMILL INN - DAY

The Saab pulls into the parking lot.

EXT./INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

Miles trudges up the stops to the room. He opens the door

and sees --

JACK

atop Stephanie, plowing her fertile fields. Despite the

interruption, their pace does not alter.

Miles quickly shuts the door.

INT. WINDMILL SPORTS BAR LOUNGE - DAY

Miles pours himself another glass of Pinot. Jack comes in

and spots his morose friend.

Jack reaches over to check out the bottle's label. Miles

remains cool to Jack's amiability.

Miles shrugs.

Jack now has his glass and pours himself some wine.

Jack just looks at him.

Jack stops short in a rare instance of self-censorship.

Miles looks at him with incredulity.

Miles just looks at his friend, waiting for more.

Miles draws a long sigh.

They fall silent for a moment. Then --

Just then Stephanie walks in. She cozies up to Jack, and he

kisses the top of her head.

INT. BOWLING ALLEY - DUSK

CLOSE ON A VIDEO GAME MONITOR

as a crazy car races through the obstacle-ridden track, often

leaving the road, much like Jack's libido.

ZOOM OUT

to reveal six-year-old SIENA seated in Jack's lap as they

drive together. A delighted Siena laughs and giggles.

Miles sits nearby with Stephanie and her fifty-something,

two-pack-a-day MOTHER CARYL.

Caryl looks over her shoulder, her gaze drawn to Jack and

Siena, so completely happy together.

Caryl exhales a puff of smoke as she watches. Stephanie is

equally enthralled. Miles takes it all in, trying his best

not to shake his head in disgust.

INT. BOWLING ALLEY PARKING LOT - DUSK

Caryl is behind the wheel of her OLDSMOBILE as Stephanie

gets Siena buckled up in the backseat. Jack pulls Miles aside.

Stephanie kisses Miles's cheek before getting in the car

next to her mom.

As he gets in the car --

Miles watches them drive away, then heads toward his Saab.

INT. MINI-MART - DUSK

CLOSE ON THE COUNTER --

as Miles places a box of security ENVELOPES, a packet of

BEEF JERKY and some TROPICAL FRUIT SKITTLES.

WIDE --

Miles points over the CASHIER'S SHOULDER.

As the cashier reaches for the magazine --

INT. MOTEL ROOM BATHROOM - NIGHT

Miles is once again FLOSSING.

INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

POP! Miles opens a bottle of Pinot and pours himself a glass.

He carries it to bed, takes a nice big slug, lies down on

the bed and opens his magazine.

NOW SNEEZING ATOP THE BED -- ANGLE ON TOP OF HIM --

The Barely Legal face down on his chest, Miles awakens with

a start and looks at the clock-radio. He thinks a moment,

takes a deep breath, and bounds off the bed.

CLOSE ON A WATER-SAVER SHOWER HEAD --

as little needles of water come at us.

THROUGH THE BATHROOM DOOR --

Miles takes a nice hot SHOWER. But wait -- he has forgotten

to put the shower curtain inside the tub. A closer look

reveals a growing PUDDLE OF WATER on the floor.

EXT. THE HITCHING POST - NIGHT

Miles walks across the parking lot. He pauses before entering,

then forces himself to take the leap.

INT. THE HITCHING POST - NIGHT

Miles affects nonchalance as he searches briefly for Maya.

He continues on into the BAR.

Miles just smiles.

WIDE --

Gary serves Miles, alone at the bar. Miles takes his first

drink.

EXT. HITCHING POST - NIGHT

It's closing time. The front door flies open, and Miles

staggers out sideways. Gary follows him out, concerned.

Miles heads in the wrong direction at first, then realizes

his mistake and steers himself back toward the Windmill.

FADE OUT.

UNDER BLACK, A CARD --

INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

The door bursts open, and Jack comes bounding in.

Miles comes to, very hungover.

EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY

WHACK! Jack TEES OFF with a manly athletic swing and shades

his eyes to watch the ball's trajectory.

Miles, disheveled and sullen, approaches the teebox, sticks

a tee in the ground and sets his ball.

Miles lifts his club.

Miles refocuses and SWINGS just as Jack offers more helpful

advice.

WHACK! Despite the distraction, Miles manages to make a good,

long drive.

NOW ON THE FAIRWAY --

Jack is pouring two Dixie cups of wine as Miles prepares to

take his next swing.

Miles says nothing.

Giving Jack a look that says Jack has no idea what he's

talking about, Miles takes a stance over the ball and focuses.

Miles drops his club and turns to Jack.

Still fuming, Miles begrudgingly accepts the wine and has a

taste. He's immediately distracted from his woes.

Miles downs the rest and is intrigued by the taste.

Suddenly a golfball THUDS against the hard fairway directly

behind them.

Way back on the tee box, some 200 yards away, are a FOURSOME

of two couples. One of the MEN is waving his driver.

Jack looks at Miles, the two incredulous.

Jack walks over, picks up the offending ball and tosses it

to Miles. Miles gets out his 3-wood and -- THWOCK! -- cuts

it back low and hard.

THE COUPLES

duck for cover as the ball whistles over their heads.

JACK AND MILES

laugh hard.

THE TWO HUSBANDS

climb in their CART and hasten down the fairway toward Jack

and Miles.

JACK

watches their approach, grinning.

Jack heads in their direction, brandishing the club like a

medieval knight with a mace.

As the husbands get a look at this sight, they turn their

cart around and speed back toward their wives.

EXT. GOLF COURSE CLUBHOUSE - DAY

Jack and Miles are turning in their cart and hoisting their

clubs over their shoulders.

Nearby a GOLFER is with his YOUNG SON.

EXT. GOLF COURSE PARKING LOT - DAY

Miles and Jack walk toward their car.

Jack's CELLPHONE rings, and he checks the caller ID.

He snaps his phone shut and turns to Miles.

Miles finally smiles.

OMITTED

EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS OLIVOS - DAY

A HIGH WIDE SHOT --

The Saab pulls up where Stephanie and Maya await with bottles

of wine and a PICNIC BASKET. The girls climb into the back

seat, and the car speeds away.

INT./EXT. THE SAAB - DAY

They're going FAST, hair whipping around.

EXT. BEAUTIFUL ROAD - DAY

WHOOSH! That car's going a little too FAST!

INT./EXT. LA PURISIMA MISSION CHURCH

The two couples wander around this historic site.

EXT. IDYLLIC PICNIC SPOT - DAY INTO DUSK

The girls have led them to a beautiful spot.

IN A SERIES OF SHOTS --

we see the progress of their picnic. We don't hear them, but

there is a growing intimacy about their interaction. Even

Maya and Miles seem to be overcoming residual awkwardness

from the other night. Jack and Stephanie lean on each other

as they eat and sip wine.

Finally, the two couples are SILHOUETTED against the SUNSET.

EXT. WINERY #3 PARKING LOT - EVENING

The parking lot is crowded. The foursome join others headed

toward the main building.

INT. WINERY #3 - EVENING

A LECTURE by British wine sage LESLIE BROUGH is in progress.

He holds aloft a RIEDEL BURGUNDY GLASS containing one of the

few but growing number of local reds worthy of his attention.

IN THE AUDIENCE --

As our foursome listen attentively, Jack leans over to Miles.

Stephanie leans forward and signals to Maya with a YAWN or a

GAGGING FINGER IN MOUTH that they hightail it. Although Miles

protests at first, they stand and leave.

AT THE BACK OF THE ROOM --

Stephanie finds a DOOR which she tests to see whether it is

open. It is! She leads her pals furtively inside --

INT. WINEMAKING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

This is an enormous, dimly-lit chamber filled with stainless

steel FERMENTATION TANKS and stacks of OAK BARRELS.

As the two couples walk in the near-darkness, they are

entranced. Maya takes Miles's hand and leads him away.

LATER --

In the background, Stephanie and Jack lean against a tank,

kissing.

CAMERA DOLLIES to reveal Miles and Maya among the barrels in

the foreground. They are shy with each other, on the verge

of kissing but holding back.

THE MUSIC CONTINUES...

INT. STEPHANIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

THREE BOTTLES OF WINE sit empty on the coffee table.

WIDE --

The four friends sit on the floor around the coffee table.

They drink wine and pass a JOINT. Suddenly they explode in

LAUGHTER.

A sleepy Siena appears at the hallway door rubbing her eyes.

Stephanie gets up, but Jack stops her, gathers Siena in his

arms, and takes her back to bed.

EXT. STEPHANIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The Saab pulls away from the house.

INT. SAAB - NIGHT

Miles sits in his own passenger seat as Maya tries her hand

at the Saab.

EXT. MAYA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Maya leads Miles up her back stairway. They're both a little

woozy from the hours of drinking.

AT THE DOOR --

Maya searches through her purse for her keys while Miles

hovers directly behind her, staring at her ear. Her ear?

Just as Maya puts the key in the lock, he impulsively leans

forward to kiss the nape of her neck. Maya's reaction is

immediate -- she turns to embrace Miles, giving him a long

KISS. Then she opens the door, pulls him inside and closes

the door in our face.

The camera PANS to the nearby ROOFTOPS.

THE SAME VIEW BY DAY, SUPERIMPOSED WITH --

The CAMERA PANS back to Maya's door, tilting down to find a

blue-wrapped NEW YORK TIMES. The door opens, and Maya's hand

picks up the newspaper. The CAMERA FOLLOWS Maya inside to --

INT. MAYA'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

It is a small, clean apartment furnished with simple taste.

Maya is dressed in a ROBE and holds a COFFEE MUG. She drops

the paper on the dining table and continues into --

THE BEDROOM --

where Miles lies on his stomach DEAD TO THE WORLD. His stubbly

face is squished against the mattress and he SNORES lightly.

Maya looks at him for a moment before shaking his foot.

EXT. FARMERS' MARKET - DAY

This is a weekly event in a big PARKING LOT -- organic

produce, candles and incense, honey and cider.

Maya and Miles are shopping. Miles carries the bags.

EXT. ORCHARD - DAY

Across from each other at a PICNIC TABLE, and surrounded by

the remnants of BREAKFAST, Miles and Maya read the NEWSPAPER.

Miles is doing the CROSSWORD PUZZLE.

Miles has just figured out a difficult clue. As he writes it

down --

Miles stops writing.

INT./EXT. PARKING AREA NEAR THE ORCHARD - DAY

Maya leads the way toward the Saab.

Maya turns to confront Miles with a look of "Give me a break."

Miles reaches out to touch her.

INT. SAAB - DAY

Miles drives, glancing occasionally at Maya, who stares

straight ahead.

A stony silence.

EXT. MAYA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Miles brings the car to a stop. Maya opens the door and begins

to get out.

Maya wants to let Miles's words reach her, but she can't

just yet.

Unsure what she wants at first, Miles reaches into the back

seat for the New York Times. He hands it to her and watches

until she goes inside.

EXT. WINDMILL INN - DAY

Miles pulls up and parks.

INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

As Miles enters, a shirtless Jack drops the Barely Legal and

is immediately upon him, grabbing him in a big BEARHUG. The

TV is on, perhaps showing an E! True Hollywood Story.

Jack continues his paean to Miles's triumphant night.

Still gripping Miles in a bearhug, Jack flings the both of

them onto the bed. Now on top of Miles, Jack KISSES both

cheeks.

Now they get up off the bed.

Jack looks at Miles, his face frozen with incomprehension.

Miles begins to calm down. Jack grows concerned and

sensitively puts one arm around his friend.

The phone RINGS and both men look at it, silenced by the

ominous sound.

But Jack is drawn to it as though enticed by a strange game

of Russian roulette.

Jack picks up the receiver and puts it to his ear.

Miles lies on his bed and clamps both hands over his ears.

His face is dark with resentment.

Jack hangs up.

INT. SEARS - DAY

Jack watches Miles be fitted for SNEAKERS. A SALES ASSOCIATE

ties Miles's laces.

Miles gets up and walks in a circle.

INT. MALL - DAY

The boys exit Sears, Miles wearing his new shoes and carrying

a PLASTIC BAG with a string handle.

Miles shrugs.

He heads toward a TOYS STORE.

Mildly concerned, Miles watches Jack go into the store.

INT./EXT. SAAB - DAY

Miles is slumped in the passenger seat as Jack drives. They

pass a BIG COMMERCIAL WINERY. Jack slows down, preparing to

turn in.

EXT. LARGE WINERY PARKING LOT - DAY

The Saab finds a place in the large parking lot. A TOUR BUS,

whose flank reads "Solvang Wine Tours," is in the process of

letting out WINE TOURISTS, many of them elderly.

INT. LARGE WINERY - DAY

The room boasts not only a large TASTING BAR but also display

after display of t-shirts, golf shirts, olive oils, chocolate

sauces and other gourmet tourist items emblazoned with the

winery's logo.

In the corner an ACOUSTIC GUITARIST with a small amp plays

soothing Windham Hill-ish music.

The tasting bar is packed three-deep with TASTERS attended

to by HARRIED POURERS.

Finally the POURER gets to their glasses. Miles chews a sip

and swallows, then downs the rest in a single gulp.

EXT. LARGE WINERY - DAY

Walking across the lawn outside, Miles holds the cellphone

to his ear.

Miles is at a loss for words. A distant RUMBLE begins to

sound, the familiar harbinger of an anxiety attack.

EXT. DEEP CANYON - INSERT

Once again we see the narrow ROPE BRIDGE extending

vertiginously across a great CHASM.

EXT. LARGE WINERY - BACK AGAIN

MOMENTS LATER --

Miles STAGGERS toward the tasting room, unpocketing his Xanax

and downing a couple, as Evelyn's cliches of consolation

continue in his head.

Once back at the tent, he leans against it in a vain attempt

to steady himself. The RUMBLE grows deafening.

INT. LARGE WINERY - DAY

Now inside, Miles grabs the first DIRTY WINE GLASS he finds

and shakes it out as he approaches the closest tasting

station. He pushes his way to front.

The pourer offers the usual one-ounce dollop. Miles jacks it

back, immediately extending his glass for more.

The same small amount is poured and downed. Once again Miles

holds out his glass.

Miles slams a TWENTY-DOLLAR BILL on the table.

The pourer turns away to serve another party. Miles looks

around indignantly, as though everyone should be sympathetic

to this injustice.

Now Miles boldly reaches over and pours himself a glass right

up to the brim and beyond.

The pourer grabs Miles by the wrist before he can drink.

In the ensuing struggle, the wine spills, and everyone nearby

steps back.

The pourer signals to a SECURITY GUY at the door. Across the

room Jack notices the disturbance and heads over.

Miles hoists up the SPIT BUCKET, holds it aloft and starts

to GUZZLE it. Wine cascades down the sides of his face, onto

his shirt and even onto his shiny new shoes.

The Security Guy yanks the bucket away from Miles, and drags

him toward the EXIT. Jack catches up.

EXT. BEACH - DAY

Two PELICANS soar low over the water. One of the DIVES,

crashing into the water and disappearing from view.

Jack and Miles sit on the hood of the Saab, gazing at the

ocean, sharing a bottle of wine.

Unable to respond, Jack looks up and down the beach.

EXT. BUCOLIC ROAD - DAY

ZOOM! There goes the Saab.

The CAMERA lingers behind and PANS to reveal THE DEAD DOG,

now covered with FLIES AND MAGGOTS.

EXT. WINDMILL INN - DAY

Jack and Miles pull into the parking lot.

He smiles broadly and honks his horn. Miles turns to see --

STEPHANIE

seated halfway up on the motel stairs, her HELMET in her

lap, watching patiently as --

THE SAAB

pulls to a stop in a parking space.

Miles masks his concern as he gets out of the car and reaches

in the backseat for his Sears bag.

Stephanie stands up and slowly descends the steps, as Jack

reaches into the trunk and pulls out a BIG CUDDLY LION DOLL.

Stephanie walks toward Jack as he waddles toward her hugging

the lion. When they get close, Stephanie's face transforms

with rage.

She swings her helmet and HITS JACK FULL IN THE FACE.

Jack falls, blood spraying out of his nose. Stephanie stands

over him and continues to BEAT HIM with her helmet as he

rolls back and forth, protecting his head with the stuffed

lion.

Miles ineffectually attempts to stop her, dancing just out

of range.

With that she backs away. Glancing at her bloodied helmet,

she tosses it onto the pavement before getting on her bike.

As she speeds away, Miles is left to comfort his wounded

friend. The lion lies nearby, staring blankly at the sky.

INT./EXT. SAAB - DAY

Seated in the passenger seat and in great agony, Jack presses

a BLOOD-SOAKED TOWEL against his face.

INT. HOSPITAL ER WAITING ROOM - DAY

CLOSE ON A COSMOPOLITAN open to an article titled "24 Ways

To Please Your Man."

WIDER --

Miles reads, while nearby a YOUNG BOY dry-heaves into a

garbage can held by his FATHER. An OLD WOMAN parked in a

wheelchair faces the wall.

LATER --

Miles is at a PAYPHONE. As he speaks he tries to peel off

the metal LONG DISTANCE STICKER.

What else to say? He hangs up.

He returns to his seat. A moment later he extends his legs

to look at his new SHOES now STAINED WITH WINE.

LATER --

Jack emerges unsteadily from the bowels of the emergency

room, his face purple and swollen beneath the HUGE WHITE

BANDAGE that holds the NOSEGUARD in place. Miles walks with

him toward the exit.

They walk by us and out the door.

EXT. STREET IN SOLVANG - DAY

Jack sits in the Saab's passenger side with the seat almost

fully reclined. When his agony allows him to open his eyes,

he glares at the DANISH THEMED STORES lining the street. An

ABELSKIVER MAKER plies his lofty trade in a nearby window.

He hears a strange CLOMPING NOISE and turns his head to see

a MAN IN WOODEN CLOGS walking noisily down the street, dressed

in a TRADITIONAL DANISH COSTUME and carrying a TUBA. Jack

takes a slug of wine.

Just then Miles gets back in the car.

Miles tears open a paper bag and removes a bottle of pills.

A closer angle reveals them as VICODIN.

Miles opens the bottle and hands Jack two PILLS.

Jack washes down the pills and passes the bottle to Miles,

who follows suit.

EXT. WINDMILL INN JACUZZI - EVENING

Jack and Miles sit across from each other. For the first

time we see LARGE PURPLE BRUISES on Jack's arms and chest.

Jack takes a long lie-detecting look at Miles.

INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

The boys lie on their respective beds staring at the TV.

Jack gets up and lumbers slowly to the dresser MIRROR like a

large dog who has just been neutered.

Jack turns to Miles, nodding and thinking. Then he looks

back in the mirror.

EXT. A.J. SPURS BARBECUE - NIGHT

Establishing. Thursday night is Cajun Wings Night.

INT. A.J. SPURS BARBECUE - NIGHT

Miles and Jack are finishing their SALADS in the rustic-

themed restaurant festooned with animal trophies.

Jack nods his head with no self-awareness or acknowledgment

of the irony.

NOW TWO PLATES ARRIVE

mounded high with ribs, slaw, beans and butter-whipped mashed

potatoes.

Their cheery, saftig blonde WAITRESS removes several FOIL

PACKETS from her apron and places them on the table.

The waitress OVER-LAUGHS and swipes a hand at her naughty

customer.

Jack watches her go and leans in close to Miles.

Now she comes back toward the table carrying a BIG BASKET.

Beneath the hideous uniform, her nylons SH-SH-SH as she walks.

When she arrives, she replenishes their corn bread basket

using big TONGS. Jack watches attentively.

Miles looks away and sighs.

As Cammi stares at Jack, her face transforms in astonishment.

Jack smiles and nods.

IN A WIDE SHOT --

Miles gets up and heads toward the bathroom as Jack's

flirtation with Cammi continues.

The camera PANS with Miles as he walks by us and goes through

the bathroom door, which closes behind him, filling the frame

with the word "MEN."

LATER --

A TOOTHPICK DISPENSER as a finger tips it forward to dispense

one.

WIDER --

Miles stands by the cash register and PICKS HIS TEETH as he

watches Jack finish speaking with Cammi and head his way.

Jack rests one hand on Miles's shoulder and drops his head,

thinking how best to put it.

CLOSE ON MILES --

as the disappointment in his friend deepens by the moment.

UNDER BLACK, SUPERIMPOSED --

Now comes the sound of hysterical KNOCKING.

INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAWN

Despite the knocking, Miles remains motionless in bed, his

expression serene.

Finally he awakens and drags himself toward the door, opening

it to find --

JACK

silhouetted against the first rosy fingers of dawn. He is

barefoot. In fact he is clad only in his UNDERWEAR. Hugging

himself, he PANTS and SHIVERS.

He limps past Miles, yanks off the bed covers and wraps them

around himself.

Miles hands him the bottle, and Jack frantically pops a couple

of pills, chewing them like candy. He sits down and bends

over at the waist as though preparing for an airplane crash.

Miles has now awakened to take in the absurdity of the whole

scene, and he LAUGHS HARD. The blanketed bulge just sits

there. Finally it looks up and shows its pitiful visage.

Jack stares straight ahead, breathing through his mouth as

he considers this. Then --

Jack now descends to a level of wretchedness and desperation

that Miles has never seen before in Jack, or in anyone else

for that matter.

No longer able to form words, Jack is reduced to emitting

low, primitive sounds. Snot flows from beneath his bandaged

nose.

INT./EXT. SAAB - MORNING

Miles drives in the early-morning light. Jack is now subdued,

quieted by his pain and exhaustion.

EXT. LOW-RENT STREET - MORNING

The Saab creeps around a corner.

INT./EXT. SAAB - MORNING

Jack scans the street.

Miles pulls over and cuts the engine.

Miles gives Jack a withering look. Jack reaches for the DOOR

HANDLE.

EXT. CAMMI'S STREET - MORNING

Miles crosses the street and approaches --

EXT. CAMMI'S HOUSE - MORNING

Miles presses his ear against the front door. Nothing. Then

he notices --

A SLIDING GLASS DOOR a few feet away, just barely cracked

open.

MILES creeps over, sticks his hand into the open space and

pulls back the curtain to reveal --

A LIVING ROOM the is hideously MESSY. Draped over a deformed

beanbag chair are JACK'S LEVI'S.

Miles gathers his courage, carefully slides open the glass

door, and creeps inside.

INT. CAMMI'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

A furtive search of Jack's pockets reveals NOTHING. Then

Miles notices a HIGH-PITCHED SOUND wafting from an open door

down a short HALLWAY.

Miles feverishly begins foraging through the debris on the

floor. Again nothing. Meanwhile the noise from the bedroom

grows louder -- female MOANING in odd rhythmic unison with a

MAN'S VOICE.

IN THE HALLWAY --

Miles gets on ALL FOURS and starts crawling, weaving his way

through a trail of shoes and clothes.

Nearing the open door, the sounds grow more distinct --

Miles peers around the corner of the open door to see --

INT. CAMMI'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Cammi is TIED to the faux brass headboard. A BIG GUY slams

away at her. In the corner a soundless TV shows a PRESIDENTIAL

PRESS CONFERENCE.

Whoa!

Miles manages to tear his eyes away from this nature

documentary and scan the room.

IRIS IN --

to the WALLET atop the dresser.

Miles's eyes dart back and forth between the couple and the

wallet. His HEART BEATING LOUDLY, he goes for it. He scrambles

to his feet, dashes across the room, seizes the wallet and

tears out. Behind him he hears --

EXT. CAMMI'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Miles comes flying out of the sliding glass door, followed

swiftly by the man, who is of course STARK NAKED. And he's

fast for a man his size.

INT. SAAB - MORNING

Jack is reclined in the passenger seat FAST ASLEEP. On the

radio NPR'S CARL KASSEL reads the news.

THROUGH THE DRIVER'S WINDOW --

Miles comes sprinting towards us, mere steps ahead of Cammi's

naked husband. Finding the car door locked, Miles knocks

loudly on the glass, startling Jack awake.

Jack flips the electric locks just in time for Miles to get

in before --

WHUMP! The guy's BELLY hits the window. He pounds on the

roof before trying the door, now re-locked.

Miles starts the car and begins to drive away. The guy tries

to keep up but can't, running barefoot on asphalt. Jack turns

to look --

OUT THE BACK WINDOW --

The guy recedes in the distance.

JACK

removes the rings from the wallet.

They LAUGH and SLAP HANDS.

CLOSE ON MILES --

For all his failures, this time he did something right.

INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

The shades are drawn. Jack is CRASHED OUT on the bed, snoring

loudly. Miles folds his shirts and trousers -- readying his

bags for departure.

At one moment he stops and watches his friend sleep.

A KNOCK at the door. Miles goes to answer it, but once his

hand is on the knob, he pauses. If we're perceptive, we will

know he's hoping against hope that it's Maya.

He opens it. It's just the MAID with her big CART.

OMIT.

EXT. 101 FREEWAY - DAY

The Saab enters the freeway and heads south.

INT./EXT. SAAB - DAY

Miles drives while Jack stares out the window, WATCHING THE

LANDSCAPE CHANGE as they leave wine country.

Jack's eyes close, but his lips spread into a smile.

EXT. 101 FREEWAY - DAY

A driving shot.

EXT. FILLING STATION - DAY

Miles pumps the gas, while nearby Jack stretches his legs.

As Miles puts the nozzle back in place --

Miles replaces the hose and screws on the gas cap.

INT. SAAB - DAY

As the car makes its way back toward the freeway, Jack looks

over at Miles and slows the car to a stop.

Miles obeys. Without hesitation, Jack accelerates and JUMPS

THE CURB, heading into --

EXT. VACANT LOT - CONTINUOUS

The Saab plows INTO A TREE.

INT. SAAB - CONTINUOUS

EXT. VACANT LOT - DAY

They get out to inspect the damage. The hood is slightly

crumpled, and the front fender is bent.

Miles looks at his friend, incredulous.

MOMENTS LATER --

The trunk is open, and the guys are unloading their cases of

wine. Miles notices that one box is DRIPPING.

MOMENTS LATER --

Miles looks on as Jack hoists a FOUNDATION BLOCK toward the

open driver's door of the Saab.

Miles waves his hand in a gesture of "Get it over with."

Grunting with effort, Jack leans inside the car and drops

the foundation block onto the GAS PEDAL.

Direct hit! Jack leaps backward and hits the dirt just in

time.

Miles and Jack watch the driverless Saab race toward the

tree, its speed increasing. But just before hitting it, the

car drifts to one side and SAILS RIGHT PAST.

The car zooms wildly across the vacant lot and, missing the

tree, continues on until CRASHING THROUGH A FENCE and finally

toppling headlong into a CEMENT TRENCH. Only the back of the

car remains visible.

The whole thing is finished in a matter of seconds. Still

frozen in place, Miles and Jack turn slowly to each other.

EXT. 101 FREEWAY - DAY

From in front of the Saab, we see its now CRUMPLED HOOD and

FENDER, a couple of BUNGEE CORDS holding the whole thing

together.

EXT. PALOS VERDES STREET - DAY

The Saab approaches the end of the line.

EXT. ERGANIAN HOUSE --DAY

AT THE FRONT PORCH --

Miles has helped Jack carry his bags and the wine. He plops

the last case down.

They give each other a brief manly back-slappy hug.

Miles heads toward the curb.

BACK AT HIS CAR --

Miles gets in and watches through the side window as Mrs.

Erganian opens the front door and welcomes Jack with shock

and dismay. Jack points back at --

MILES raising one hand in a feeble wave. The camera slowly

MOVES CLOSER as he continues to watch --

JACK --

weaving his story of woe. He's a great actor when he wants

to be. Mr. Erganian and a mortified Christine come to the

door too. Mr. Erganian takes a few steps toward the car to

get a better look.

VERY CLOSE ON MILES --

watching the drama play out. Then his eyes drop as he

momentarily loses himself in melancholy. This reverie is

interrupted by --

THE VOICE OF AN ARMENIAN PRIEST

Startled, Miles turns to look at --

A PRIEST

who is singing the BLESSING OF THE RINGS.

We are now in --

INT. ARMENIAN APOSTOLIC CHURCH - DAY

The church is packed.

CLOSE ON THE RINGS as the priest holds them aloft.

If those rings could talk... Jack shoots a quick look at

Miles, who looks right back. The priest continues his

blessing.

EXT. ARMENIAN CHURCH - DAY

AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS --

The WEDDING FAMILIES greet the exiting guests in a RECEIVING

LINE. Smiling and exuberant, Jack seems utterly at home as

the new groom.

AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STEPS --

Miles watches the scene, not without melancholy. Then --

Miles turns and looks up to see Victoria, standing one step

above him. Just behind her is her NEW HUSBAND. He exudes the

quiet confidence of a successful businessman who played

college football, takes expensive skiing and sailing

vacations, and hasn't read a novel since high school.

From his spot hovering over Miles, Ken leans down and offers

his hand.

Exit Ken.

Just then a BLACK LINCOLN NAVIGATOR pulls up alongside the

curb. The passenger side window is halfway down, and the

sounds of Adult Contemporary Jazz waft out. Victoria gives

Ken a little wave.

As she gets in the car and cruises away, Miles glances back

at --

THE RECEIVING LINE

-- where Mike Erganian is introducing Jack to some dear old

FRIENDS. Mike throws a loving arm around his new son-in-law,

and Jack is drawn into Mike's bosom.

EXT. STREET - DAY

A HAND-PAINTED SIGN, attached to a STOP SIGH and decorated

with balloons, reads: "RECEPTION THIS WAY!" with an arrow

pointing RIGHT.

One by one, CARS are making a right turn. But when his turn

comes, Miles turns LEFT.

EXT. MILES'S APARTMENT COMPLEX - DAY

The Saab pull up outside. Miles leaves the car idling as he

sprints inside. Moments later he sprints back to his car,

this time carrying SOMETHING.

OMIT

INT. FAST FOOD PLACE - DAY

His bowtie undone, Miles sits at a booth eating. He washes

down a bite by draining the contents of a big wax-coated

soft drink cup.

He brings the cup to his lap and refills it from a BOTTLE OF

WINE hidden next to him. As he sets the bottle back down, we

glimpse the label: 1961 Cheval Blanc.

He takes another sip. As the camera MOVES CLOSER, all the

complex emotions inspired by the wine ripple across Miles's

face.

INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

The voice belongs to one of Miles's PUPILS reading aloud in

class. Other students follow along silently from their own

copies of A Separate Peace.

SUPERIMPOSED --

Miles sits behind his desk at the front of the class.

The students look up.

INT. MILES'S APARTMENT - EVENING

Miles enters his tiny apartment. He loosens his tie and puts

down his satchel.

On his way to the kitchen, he presses a button on his

ANSWERING MACHINE. As it plays, he opens the REFRIGERATOR

and looks inside.

Miles FREEZES, not wanting to miss a single syllable.

Miles's heart pounds.

INT./EXT. SAAB - DAY

THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD --

We see ourselves taking the BUELLTON EXIT.

EXT. MAYA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Miles climbs the wooden steps and approaches Maya's back

door.

Miles takes a breath. Finally he KNOCKS.

FADE OUT.
