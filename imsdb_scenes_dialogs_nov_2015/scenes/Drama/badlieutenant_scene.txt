This story takes place during a World Series between the

Mets and the A's. Canseco plays for Oakland, and Strawberry

is still with New York.

EXT: EARLY MORNING - LT'S HOME - QUEENS

This typical QUEENS HOUSE is sandwiched between other

neighboring, nearly identical HOUSES.

The MORNING SOUNDS Of FAMILY BICKERING, LAWN MOWERS, and

SHOUTED GOOD-BYES are heard coming from many HOUSES on this

close-knit block. A NEW BABY can be heard BAWLING inside

LT'S HOUSE.

LT, hurried and harried, stumbles out his FRONT DOOR. He

heads for his CAR, parked askew in the DRIVEWAY.

LT is some 40 years old. His natural swagger makes up for

his lack of conventional good looks. He is obviously hung-

over.

LT squints, pained by the SUN. He fumbles with his SHADES,

puts them on.

LT's TWIN EIGHT YEAR-OLD SONS trundle out the FRONT DOOR of

the HOUSE, bickering as they run to catch up with their Daddy.

The hefty TWINS wear ill-fitting PAROCHIAL SCHOOL UNIFORMS.

Their oversize PAROCHIAL SCHOOL BRIEFCASES threaten to trip

them up.

LT's WIFE, BABE in arms, comes out to watch LT's lovely SEVEN

YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER head off toward her school on foot. Many

other members of LT's EXTENDED FAMILY hang out on the STOOP

and the LAWN.

As the TWINS cross the LAWN, the bickering turns physical.

They start whacking each other with the BRIEFCASES. The TWINS

pile into LT'S CAR.

INT: MORNING - LT'S CAR - EN ROUTE TO/AT PAROCHIAL SCHOOL

The CAR is obviously LT's home away from home. FOOD DEBRIS,

BEER CANS, VODKA BOTTLES and other garbage litter the

interior.

An impressive HAND-GUN is visible between the seats.

An old ICON of MOTHER MARY rides on the DASHBOARD.

As the TWINS get in, LT tries to hide the GUN and the illicit

detritus.

To little avail. The TWINS pay no mind to his machinations;

they have evidently seen it all before.

As LT drives the TWINS to SCHOOL, the three play wild rough-

house.

The CAR swerves crazily.

ON RADIO: Chatter about Mets winning last night's game. It

was the THIRD GAME straight that they've won so far. One

more game -- set for tomorrow afternoon -- and the Mets will

sweep the World Series. All listen.

The TWINS whoop and shout, celebrating LT's -- and their own --

favorite player.

They pass the PAROCHIAL SCHOOL BUS. It has stopped for a

moment taking on KIDS. LT cuts off the TWINS' tirade.

LT and the TWINS banter back and forth, poke each other and

box around. The apparent hostility of their words is balanced

by the laughter and gung-ho play of the rough-housing. The

TWINS yell cat-calls as they drive past a BLONDE PEDESTRIAN.

LT joins in.

ANGLE - Through the WINDSHIELD, the PAROCHIAL SCHOOL comes

into view. A CROWD of UNIFORMED KIDS is gathered outside.

SEVERAL NUNS turn the CROWD into two neat rows, and usher

the KIDS inside.

POV LT - THE NUNS

The TWINS get out. Join the line of students entering the

SCHOOL.

The instant the KIDS have left the CAR -- LT takes out some

COKE. Snorts it. He takes his GUN out of hiding.

LT steers with his knees as he drives off toward the City.

EXT: AFTERNOON - QUEENS - CRIME SCENE

ANGLE - A CAR WINDSHIELD. Blood-spattered and shot up. The

DEAD BODIES of TWO GIRLS are in the front seat.

LT gets out of his CAR and makes his way through the COPS

and GAWKERS.

The BET COP comes up to LT.

LT gives a cursory glance to the crime scene. A couple of

COPS greet him; LT keeps walking.

The BET COP digs his attitude.

FOLLOW LT - over to a GROUP of COPS. They greet him and

everyone immediately crams into a parked CAR. The CAR stays

parked for the duration of their meeting.

INT: AFTERNOON - UNMARKED COP CAR (PARKED) - QUEENS

Now that LT, the BET COP and the OTHER COPS are inside the

CAR, they can do business. LT pays several COPS their WINNINGS

for last night's game. CASH and congratulatory banter is

exchanged.

Now LT has to take their BETS for tomorrow afternoon's GAME,

the FOURTH GAME of the World Series. LT urges the COPS to

bet against the Mets.

Silence. The COPS think about it for a moment.

BET COP speaks up first; hands LT some CASH. When he talks

to LT, his fawning posture is obvious.

COP ONE SHRUGS his assent, gives CASH to LT. The OTHER COPS

follow his example, place their BETS on OAKLAND.

The COP BETS total $800 -- on OAKLAND. LT has obviously been

the bookie for this precinct for a long time. He takes care

of a lot of action and has these guy's faith.

LT nods a goodbye, quickly gets out of the CAR. The BET COP

and the OTHER COPS remain inside.

EXT: AFTERNOON - PAY PHONE - MIDTOWN - 38TH STREET & 3RD

AVENUE

LT pulls up alone beside a PHONE BOOTH and phones in the

COPS' bets and his own to LITE. More than an anonymous

connection to the BOOKIE, LITE is obviously LT's old friend --

and a hustler just like himself.

LT shouts into the PHONE and holds it close to his ear. The

TRAFFIC NOISE is loud and irritating.

ACROSS THE STREET - TWO GUYS approach a BUSINESSMAN in a

raincoat and flash a KNIFE. The BUSINESSMAN gives up his

WALLET and his WATCH.

LT pays no mind to the robbery.

LT hangs up the PHONE, heads back toward his parked CAR.

By this time, the BUSINESSMAN is running into the street,

waving his arms and screaming.

LT enters his car, drives off.

EXT: EVENING - CRACK CITY

LT arrives, leading a BUST. Lots of COPS. LT chases a handsome

young COKE DEALER, JC, cornering him a couple flights up a

staircase. Now they're alone and the phony pantomime is over.

JC gives it to him with a PIPE. LT takes a drag of CRACK.

Then LT gives JC a large BAG of COKE, labelled "Exhibit A".

JC nods, bemused by LT's manic behavior. JC, in contrast, is

mellow and in control. LT smokes; JC doesn't.

LT COUGHS and SMOKES as he shouts to COPS downstairs (OFF).

The COPS (OFF) rush out of the building.

JC watches LT smoking like a fiend.

LT takes a handful of the COKE and puts it in a DOLLAR BILL;

pockets it.

JC splits, runs up the stairs.

INT: NIGHT - ARIANE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM

Religious/hip artifacts abound. It's a nice, if messy

apartment.

However, it is definitely not large enough to merit the $3,500

that ARIANE quotes as her rent.

ARIANE is LT's mistress.

BOWTAY, her girlfriend, lounges on the COUCH. BOWTAY plays

the third when LT is in the mood for a menage a trois. She's

around a lot.

BOWTAY is already zonked out on something. Maybe LUDES.

LT gives her the COKE. ARIANE takes some immediately. BOWTAY

sloppily partakes.

Before LT can even sit down, the GIRLS start bitching.

ANGLE - BOWTAY on the COUCH. It's obvious that she's going

nowhere. And fast.

LT breaks out more COKE and some GRASS.

ARIANE lifts BOWTAY to her feet. BOWTAY staggers into the

center of the room, then falls back down on her knees. It

happens to be appropriate for the scene.

BOWTAY begins to recite the monologue from the very end of

the play. "When will the world be ready to receive thy

saints?", etc.

BOWTAY messes up a line; ARIANE lashes her with a BELT.

BOWTAY doesn't move, continues reciting. ARIANE joins in

from time to time.

LT is turned on.

He begins KISSING ARIANE, then goes down onto the floor.

BOWTAY is there already.

Kinky trio sex scene.

INT: LATER THAT NIGHT - ARIANE'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN

It's evidently an hour or so later.

The KITCHEN is very bachelorette. No FOOD or COOKING

IMPLEMENTS in sight.

LT is messing around, looking for something to DRINK. He

opens the REFRIGERATOR.

POV LT - CU - The REFRIGERATOR is entirely empty, save for a

few suspect and peculiar items. There is nothing in liquid

form.

LT hears ARIANE calling to him from the LIVING ROOM.

It's clear from the SEX SOUNDS (OC), that ARIANE and BOWTAY

are still going at it.

LT obeys. He leaves the KITCHEN.

INT: NIGHT - ARIANE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM

LT passes through the LIVING ROOM, putting on his CLOTHING

as he heads for the DOOR to OUTSIDE.

The GIRLS don't miss a sexual beat. They continue what is

now a menage a deux. They won't miss LT while he's gone.

LT splits. No good-byes.

EXT/INT: LATE NIGHT - KOREAN DELI

LT approaches the market where he intends to buy the DIET

COKES.

A display of FRESH FRUITS & VEGETABLES extends onto the

sidewalk.

LT notices a SQUAD CAR, parked in front of the MARKET. LT

picks up his pace.

Closer now, LT sees a YOUNG UNIFORMED COP outside, standing

with the KOREAN OWNER, an elderly man who doesn't speak much

English. The OWNER is agitated and out of breath. He argues

fiercely with TWO YOUNG BLACK KIDS.

A SQUAD CAR is parked in front of the MARKET.

LT gets an idea. He takes command.

The UNIFORMED COP is a timid rookie.

The KOREAN OWNER is still agitated. He tries to give his

side of the story, mixing English and Korean. At the same

time --

The TWO BLACK KIDS plead their case. They try to drown out

the OWNER. It all gets rather noisy.

LT shouts in the YOUNG BLACK KID'S FACE. It's shockingly

loud.

LT turns to the UNIFORMED COP.

The UNIFORMED COP looks at LT for a moment, then goes.

LT is now alone with the KOREAN OWNER and the TWO YOUNG BLACK

KIDS.

LT turns to the OWNER.

The TWO YOUNG BLACK KIDS continue protesting their innocence.

LT whips out his GUN and shoots a deafening BLAST between

the TWO KIDS' heads.It almost takes off the left ear of one

and the right ear of the other.

The TWO YOUNG BLACK KIDS are stunned. Speechless.

The YOUNG UNIFORMED COP rushes out of the MARKET, GUN raised

in one hand, BEER CAN in the other. He's relieved that a cop

wasn't shot, but the whole situation makes him uneasy.

LT grabs the BEER, points to the KOREAN OWNER.

The OWNER protests wildly in Korean as the flustered COP

ushers him into a waiting SQUAD CAR. They drive off.

Now LT is alone with the TWO YOUNG BLACK KIDS.

LT takes the KIDS inside at gunpoint.

INT: The store appears to be deserted.

The TWO YOUNG BLACK KIDS have regained some of their cool.

They are still belligerent.

LT jams his GUN down the PANTS of one of the KIDS. At the

same time, he whips out his BADGE and thrusts it into the

other KID'S FACE.

They give LT the CASH. The KIDS stand there.

The KIDS, stunned, split.

LT swaggers around the store, GUN in hand, drinking the BEER,

assessing the inventory with a proprietary air. He pretends

to SHOOT at various products. Plays around.

In the back aisle, LT aims his GUN at a BIG BOX of TOILET

PAPER.

While he holds the TOILET PAPER at bay, a THIRTEEN YEAR-OLD

KOREAN KID rises up from behind it, his hands up, terrified.

LT LAUGHS, then puts the GUN away.

On LT's smiling face, we --

INT: DAWN - ARIANE'S APARTMENT

BOWTAY is curled up on the floor, asleep.

ARIANE is busy with a GOBLET, some TIN FOIL and other esoteric

stuff.

LT comes through the door with the SIX-PACK of DIET COKES

and the SIX-PACK of BUDWEISER.

He puts them down, takes a BEER for himself. ARIANE doesn't

turn around. She's busy preparing drugs.

LT comes and looks over her shoulder. He sees --

A PILE of BROWN HEROIN on a TIN FOIL SHEET. ARIANE is

preparing the implements for "chasing the dragon."

BOWTAY rolls over, sprawls on the floor in an even sexier

position.

On her face, an expression of utter bliss.

LT abandons the BEER.

ARIANE helps LT with the thin, TIN FOIL PIPE. She burns the

SMACK on the TIN FOIL SHEET for him so that he can manage to

inhale the PLUME OF SMOKE in time.

He gets a nice, deep hit.

ARIANE gracefully takes a hit of her own.

They are both very high, already. Beginning to NOD OUT.

ARIANE goes back to the IMPLEMENTS and prepares another hit.

This time she catches the SMOKE in a SHERRY GOBLET and LT

drinks it.

LT is very high now. A meditative, hallucinatory state.

ARIANE takes a DIET COKE and lies down on the BED.

She slowly sips soda through a straw. Her eyes are closed.

LT sits in an EASY CHAIR by the WINDOW.

LT NODS OUT while watching the SUNRISE. What we see appears

to be HIS DREAM. From the melting RED SUN, we --

EXT: DAWN (MEANWHILE)  CHURCH/CONVENT

BLOOD! TWO KIDS are raping a NUN, attacking the SECOND NUN,

and shitting on the ALTAR. Going berserk. They steal PURPLE

ROBES and the CHALICE.

From the FIRST NUN, on her back on the altar, her robes ripped

open, a heart-rending pieta, we --

INT: LATE AFTERNOON - LT'S HOME - QUEENS

ANGLE - CARTOONS on TV.

LT has overslept, out cold on the COUCH. A LITTLE GIRL sits

on the floor, two feet from the TV, watching CARTOONS. Various

other members of LT's over-extended FAMILY can be seen moving

around the house, going about their business.

A CARTOON EXPLOSION wakes LT. He jumps up in a panic.

LT bounds off the COUCH, Still half-asleep, he crawls to the

TV, turns on GAME FOUR. The LITTLE GIRL starts CRYING.

An ANCIENT AUNT pokes her head into the LIVING ROOM.

She disappears again.

LT leans into the TV, transfixed, as --

ON TV: STRAWBERRY makes a fantastic catch of a Canseco drive

with runners on base. LT CHEERS.

DOORS SLAM (OFF). The TWINS have come home from school.

They burst into the LIVING ROOM, loud as Hell. Furious about

something they out-curse each other.

LT curses and stomps around. The TWINS mimic his every move.

All three are pissed. The rest of the FAMILY pays no mind.

INT: EVENING - LT'S CAR

LT is furious. He COKES UP. DRINKS heavily.

Tired of the SPORTS STATIONS, LT turns on 911. There is a

call for an uptown MURDER SCENE.

EXT: NIGHT - 153RD/MARTIN LUTHER KING - CRIME SCENE

CU - A YOUNG BLACK DEALER, eyes open, shot dead.

LT drives up, sizes up the scene. It's fresh territory. He'll

milk it for what it's worth.

LT ignores his colleagues, the COPS ON THE SCENE. He knows

some of the DEALERS and STREET CHARACTERS on the sidelines.

He heads straight for them.

LT greets an impressively beautiful, six foot tall

TRANSVESTITE. He takes her aside.

LT slips a HUNDRED DOLLAR BILL into VERONICA'S well-filled

BRA.

LT saunters up to the MURDER CAR, DEAD WILLIE still in the

front seat. LT is obviously berserk to get the KI, but he

can't show it. LT susses out the situation.

Around him, POLICE TECHNICIAN-TYPES are busy lifting

fingerprints and analyzing the CAR and WILLIE -- to no

apparent avail.

LT uses his Lieutenants' privilege to enter the MURDER CAR

and begin his own investigation.

TIRE TRACKS are discovered nearby. The OTHER COPS are

distracted.

LT takes his shot. He reaches for and finds the KI of COCAINE

under the BACK SEAT. LT slips it under his COAT and emerges

from the MURDER CAR.

Outside the MURDER CAR, LT makes to stand up. In the act, he --

DROPS the BAG of COKE!

LT is stunned. He can't believe the KI is actually in the

shitty, gutter water, in plain view of the other COPS.

The COPS spot the KILO of COKE. Even those COPS that were

far away, somehow know what has happened. They quickly gather

round the MURDER CAR, LT, and the KI.

The PLASTIC BAG filled with WHITE POWDER floats on the DEEP

PUDDLE.

LT is silent wrath incarnate.

Among the gathered COPS, only a SERGEANT is not quite

convinced.

The other COPS ignore the query.

LT walks away.

LT has successfully covered himself, but he walks off cursing

and mumbling.

VERONICA is laughing demonstratively in the background.

LT is further away now from the scene of WILLIE'S murder and

his own debacle. LT overhears something. Cuts off his

muttering.

A group of COPS are talking about the big news from the early

morning.

LT stops in his tracks. The erotic import of this conversation

has seized LT's imagination. He heads toward the cluster of

COPS, cuts in.

The COPS turn away, continue to talk among themselves. LT

walks away.

EXT: NIGHT - A CITY HOSPITAL PARKING LOT

LT pulls up. Parks near a group of OTHER COPS, waiting by

their CARS.

HOSPITAL fauna passes by in the background: DOCTORS, NURSES,

PATIENTS in all stages of recovery or relapse. The HOSPITAL

itself rises in the background. It looks like a prison.

LT leaves his CAR, heads for the GROUP of COPS. He joins

them, sits down on the HOOD of a nearby CAR. The COPS are

all DRINKING heavily.

Present are the BET COP, and several other FAMILIAR COPS

from previous scenes.

A COP opens his TRUNK -- he has a BAR inside. The COPS,

including LT, respond enthusiastically. DRINK UP.

The COPS keep DRINKING. All of them lounging around on or

beside the CARS.

LT watches quietly, taking it all in. As if following the

motto: "He who defines himself, confines himself."

The FIRST COP raises a TOAST.

The COPS all whoop and cheer.

COPS avoid each others' eyes. Competition has begun. No one

shares information, each after the reward for himself.

LT bursts out, swings into high gear.

Some of the COPS laugh, others are offended.

LT doesn't reply. He's thinking.

The BET COP and a couple of OTHER, FAMILIAR GAMBLER COPS

move in. They've got nothing on their minds but the World

Series.

LT comes down off the CAR HOOD. Now he has to feign pride in

his supposed big bet on OAKLAND.

LT has to convince the COPS to keep betting -- he can't afford

to pay them all off. Unfortunately, the COPS all think LT

just scored big, himself.

LT nods "yes." An outright lie.

SEVERAL COPS, including some of the COPS who have been hanging

out in front of the HOSPITAL, go double or nothing on OAKLAND.

LT takes their BET MONEY -- $900.

One COP doesn't go along with the deal. LT painfully pays

him off.

LT sits back on top of his CAR, DRINKING heavily. He toasts

STRAWBERRY. The others are uneasy. Why toast STRAWBERRY?

The others join in the TOAST, but are uneasy.

INT: LATE NIGHT - CORRIDORS OF A CITY HOSPITAL - HUNTING FOR

THE NUN

The HOSPITAL is an inferno. LT exploits his cop privileges;

shows his BADGE to the GUARDS.

He wants to get into the inner sanctum. Beyond where even

COPS were allowed to go. He wants to get to the NUN.

A sexy NURSE stops him.

LT can't help but check her out and flirt.

The NURSE looks at him, unsure, then walks off down the

CORRIDOR.

LT continues his hunt.

He comes upon a DOOR that is plastered with "QUARANTINE"

SIGNS. One too many, perhaps. LT senses the NUN is inside.

He has to open the DOOR, but hopes he won't get a blast of

disease in his face. He CROSSES himself -- wearing a smirk,

but nonetheless. Going on instinct, LT opens the door a crack.

He's right. It's the NUN. He positions himself outside the

DOOR, keeping it open a few inches. He peeks inside without

being seen.

INT: LATE NIGHT - THE NUN'S HOSPITAL EXAMINING ROOM

From just outside the door, LT peep-toms on the NUN while

she is being examined. He sees her stark naked, laid out on

a table, her legs spread wide apart.

The DOCTORS, NURSES, COUNSELORS work on the NUN as if they

are automatons. They don't grasp either the humanity or the

trotitism of the scene. LT does. The image of The Alabaster

Nun turns him on no end. Yet there is also a deeper pathos

to the scene.

And the NUN is spectacularly beautiful. She doesn't speak.

Looks like a Pieta.

A DOCTOR in a WHITE-COAT reads the MEDICAL REPORT to a FEMALE

COP. The FEMALE COP writes down the details on a hard-backed

pad. As if it's a parking ticket.

The moving contrast between the words and the image seems to

be apparent to LT -- and the NUN -- alone.

Finally, as if she knew he was there all along, the NUN looks

up at where LT is hiding and boldly meets his eyes.

INT: VERY LATE NIGHT - ARIANE'S APARTMENT

LT has been there for some time. They are alone. They've

both been DRINKING and COKING.

LT is carrying on about the NUN. As he speaks about various

subjects, his tone changes radically. From contempt and

cynicism to profound reverence. From decadence -- to awe.

ARIANE, too, manages to switch from one attitude to the other.

ARIANE can't stop thinking about the rape.

ARIANE suddenly starts up.

LT thinks for a moment.

LT snaps out once again, grabs the TELEPHONE. He dials LITE.

He's not in. LT leaves ARIANE'S NUMBER on LIMELITE'S BEEPER.

Hangs up.

ARIANE can't get the image of the rape out of her mind.

LT stubs out his CIGARETTE on the back of his hand. He does

the move with intensity and bravado.

ARIANE responds by calmly doing the same. But she does it

entirely impassively, and rubs the CIGARETTE into her flesh

longer than LT did.

ARIANE comes over to LT and starts kissing and licking his

CHEST.

LT hesitates.

ARIANE kneels down in front of LT. As if in prayer.

She starts giving him head.

Before he can answer The Question, he is saved by the bell.

The PHONE RINGS. LT picks up immediately. It's LITE.

As LT speaks to LITE, ARIANE continues to give him head.

LT hangs up, thinks ARIANE won't resurface the God Question.

ARIANE does, even as she gives him head. Every time she

speaks, she pulls away and it frustrates him. This dialectic

continues throughout the scene.

LT thinks about it, even as ARIANE gets him hotter and hotter.

LT can't respond. He's distracted by his own pleasure.

ARIANE does something OC that causes LT sudden pain.

LT cries out. Snaps to attention. Looks at ARIANE.

ARIANE gives him head again. LT is more excited now than

before she hurt him.

As if in answer. LT begins to RECITE THE ACT OF CONTRITION

This turns on ARIANE. She stops talking. Writhes and grapples

him.

LT is reaching climax. When describing Jesus rising again --

LT has an orgasm.

EXT INT: VERY LATE NIGHT - LT'S CAR

LT drives, DRUNK and fired-up. He has a BOTTLE of VODKA in

the CAR.

POV LT - A CAR with only one TAILLIGHT. A Cyclops in the

darkness. Under a STREETLIGHT, JERSEY PLATES are visible. So

are the two inebriated, leather-clad GIRLS inside. LT pulls

them over.

LT comes on to them. He's way out there. The GIRLS are

smashed.

LT notes their "Heavy Metal" CROSSES, and questions them.

LT looks at their PAPERS. Points to the name to which the

CAR is registered.

LT gets into the CAR, looks around. He finds a BAG OF POT.

LT waves the POT in front of the GIRLS.

The GIRLS are petrified.

LT grins. He takes out his own ROLLING PAPER, starts to ROLL

a JOINT with their POT.

He blackmails them into humiliating sex scenes. On a side

street off Eleventh Avenue, LT plays it out until dawn.

EXT INT: DAWN - THE CHURCH/CONVENT

LT drives up erratically and parks his CAR in front of the

CHURCH/CONVENT.

LT stumbles into the CHURCH. Alone now, he notes various

aspects of the DESECRATION, but can't see much because he's

blind drunk.

The enormous, graphically bloody CRUCIFIX confronts him.

He collapses immediately into a PEW. Sleeps.

TIME PASSES

INT: MORNING - CHURCH/CONVENT

LT wakes up. Ruckus all around him. The COPS are there in

force -- including some of the guys from the BAR, the UPTOWN

MURDER and the HOSPITAL PARKING LOT. They are privately

checking out the Scene of the Crime, looking for leads that

will give them an advantage. Everyone wants the TWO NUNS to

talk. The NUNS are in a circle of interrogators. At first,

LT can't even see them.

The ELDERLY NUN was attacked but not raped. They carved

crosses on her.

In the background, the questioning has already begun. The

interrogators become increasingly frustrated. It can be heard

in their voices. They want the reward, and -- despite a

certain constipated "respect" in their attitude -- the COPS

are willing to browbeat the NUNS to get it.

LT silently bums a COFFEE off a COP and staggers into the

ring.

LT hangs back in the crowd, staring at the YOUNG NUN as the

COPS interrogate both NUNS.

The ELDERLY NUN speaks up.

LT, on the sidelines, turns to an OLDER COP. LT mutters his

commentary

The ELDERLY NUN lowers her head. Shamed.

Now the COPS are magnetized by the YOUNG NUN. She does not

appear to need GLASSES. Evidently, she could give the COPS

what they want.

LT watches the YOUNG NUN as --

POV LT - The YOUNG NUN smiles a quiet, intractable smile.

COP 2 is screaming mad, but tries to hide it.

LT has observed their interaction. Though he would have loved

to have heard some information from the YOUNG NUN, her

defiance gives him even more pleasure.

The MONSIGNOR comes forward to "translate" the NUNS' stubborn

silence. He is possessed by a conventional sort of ambition --

this is his big chance. He would like to be Cardinal some

day, but never will be. He enjoys the spotlight as he

pontificates.

The MONSIGNOR clears his throat demonstratively, takes a

dicitous tone.

The YOUNG NUN shoots the MONSIGNOR an offended look.

It appears for a moment as if the YOUNG NUN makes eye contact

with LT. But he can't be sure.

LT leaves the crowd, disappears out the DOOR.

INT: LATE AFTERNOON - RUSH HOUR - LT'S CAR - 54TH STREET AT

FIFTH AVENUE

LT is driving through HEAVY TRAFFIC while listening to GAME

FIVE on the RADIO. He COKES UP. He mumbles to himself.

GAME FIVE is close, and features STRAWBERRY. As LT listens,

he reacts physically to the changing status of the game.

He drives crazy through the streets, pounds the ceiling.

He's so COKED, he's bouncing out of his skin. LT drinks VODKA

out of a PINT BOTTLE in his COAT.

STRAWBERRY overthrows a sacrifice fly from Canseco and the

A's WIN.

LT shoots out the CAR RADIO. LT LOSES! He's $30,000 down.

Covering himself, he puts the LIGHTS on top of his CAR. Turns

the SIREN on. Screaming CURSES, he drives through the streets,

careening like a madman. PEDESTRIANS run away in terror.

INT: AFTERNOON  "WHITE" CHURCH  HIS DAUGHTER'S FIRST

COMMUNION

CU  LT'S EIGHT YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER takes the WAFER for the

first time.

LT is dressed to kill. Looks like a corpse.

He watches his DAUGHTER'S First Communion and is truly moved.

Remembers his own past.

While the rest of the attendant EXTENDED FAMILY, FRIENDS,

and SOME COPS enter the COMMUNION PARADE, LT stands alone at

the back of the CHURCH like an usher. He holds the COLLECTION

BASKET and quietly watches the whole scene.

LT, his betting friend who is not a cop comes up beside him.

LITE looks his friend up and down as if he's lost his mind.

LITE gestures assent, but is not happy. He waits a moment,

looks around.

POV LITE - LT'S FRIENDS and FAMILY. LT'S DAUGHTER in her

COMMUNION DRESS.

From the pristine interior of the "WHITE CHURCH" we --

INT: AFTERNOON  THE CHURCH/CONVENT

The interior of the CHURCH/CONVENT is still desecrated. In

stark contrast to the "White Church" (above, Scene 22).

POLICE ROPES have cordoned off certain desecrated areas of

the CHURCH. In other places, MOPS and SLOPPY BUCKETS of SHIT-

WATER wait for someone to finish cleaning up.

LT appears to be entirely alone in the CHURCH. He is desperate

for clues. He searches for leads and perhaps, for something

else...

CU - He lights a CANDLE, gives a QUARTER --

Then LT lights his CRACKPIPE ever the FLAME.

Suddenly the NUN appears.

LT hides, watches as the NUN enters the CONFESSIONAL Once

she is ensconced inside, LT stealthly approaches the

CONFESSIONAL and from right outside -- a tantalizing proximity --

he listens as she confesses to the PRIEST. (This is an elderly

PRIEST with a striking, unusual voice. Not the MONSIGNOR

from the COPS' interrogation of the NUNS. Scene 20.)

The NUN LAUGHS. At first, it sounds like crying. But it is a

strange, low laughter.

Outside the CONFESSIONAL. LT reacts to the explicit word.

Shock. Titillation and fascination.

Outside the CONFESSIONAL, LT stiffens. This could be the

clue he needs to solve the case.

The NUN'S description of the RAPE is both a turn on for LT

and a matter of profound curiosity. Something divine. His

silent reactions embody both decadence and awe. This apparent

paradox can find unified expression in his character, though

at other moments it threatens to tear him apart. The tension

between the two polarities will propel him toward his destiny.

LT can't help but start up. As if, telepathically, the NUN

knew he was there and cried out to him. Asked him to complete

her mission.

LT senses the confession is over. As the PRIEST begins to

speak again, LT snaps to and returns to his original hiding

place, near the CANDLES.

LT watches as the NUN exits the CONFESSIONAL, KNEELS, holds

her ROSARY BEADS, and begins to whisper the ACT OF CONTRITION --

what LT recited as ARIANE gave him head.

The NUN does penance. LT watches her, still hidden, and

transfixed.

Cut from THE NUN to --

INT: EVENING - ARIANE'S APARTMENT

CU - LT fucking a NUN.

Its ARIANE.

This time LT doesn't rebel against the religious import of

these last days. Rather, he incorporates it into their sex.

He has dressed ARIANE as a NUN. Now it is silent pantomime

that expresses both decadence and awe.

INT: LATE NIGHT  LT'S HOME  QUEENS

FOLLOW LT as he walks through his home late at night. Each

room has several FAMILY MEMBERS in it, all asleep. Even the

TWINS sleep in tandem, on matching BUNK BEDS.

LT sits down in the KITCHEN. All is silent, peaceful.

A moment passes.

LT stands up and goes over to the REFRIGERATOR. He takes out

a CARTON OF MILK.

Sits back down. DRINKS the MILK.

LT calmly looks at what's on the KITCHEN TABLE.

A PILE OF BILLS, note attached from his WIFE: "Pay These."

A GROUP OF PHOTOS from the COMMUNION, already quickie

developed. They are spread out all over the TABLE.

A MORNING TABLOID NEWSPAPER, STRAWBERRY featured on the COVER.

LT finishes looking at the various artifacts of his life. He

sighs, leans back, appears to be -- dare we say it -- at

peace.

FADE TO BLACK;

EXT: LATE AFTERNOON - SHEA STADIUM - THE SIX GAME OF THE

WORLD SERIES

The MASSIVE CROWD ROARS.

The STADIUM is decked out in the RED, WHITE, and BLUE BUNTING

signifying the WORLD SERIES. A ROW OF UNIFORMED COPS is in

the front row. Among them --

LT. He watches STRAWBERRY as --

With winning runs on, STRAWBERRY takes strike three, to lose

the game.

As STRAWBERRY walks off the field, he and LT face off.

One on one.

LT has lost the $60,000 bet. He knows how heavy this is.

That his life is new in danger.

The CROWD vents its rage. The deafening SOUND takes on a

sensuous rhythm and becomes DANCE MUSIC, as --

From EXTREME CU - the BLACK FACE OF STRAWBERRY, we --

FADE TO BLACK;

INT: EVENING - LIMELIGHT NIGHTCLUB

Half-nude DANCERS whirling in and out of sight, round and

round in the strobe-flashed darkness.

The DANCE MUSIC steals ones senses, makes conversation nearly

impossible. People communicate in pantomime.

LT pushes his way through the CROWD He cranes his neck,

desperately searching for someone. At last, he spots his

target.

POV LT - A RESIDENT COKE DEALER. His FACE is visible, floating

above the writhing crowd.

LT pursues him. Finally catches him.

They mime the deal. LT buys some COKE for immediate use.

LT does the COKE off his wrist as he moves through the CROWD.

LT trembles, frantic and manic-high, as he goes to his meeting

with LITE. LT plows his way through the CROWD, heading toward

the back of the club and the entrance to the V.I.P ROOM.

Even this state, when he sights ACQUAINTANCES. LT turns on

the charm and works the room.

LT nears the V.I.P. ROOM.

POV LT - The entrance to the V.I.P. ROOM is guarded by a

PURPLE VELVET ROPE and an effete DOORMAN.

When the DOORMAN sights LT, he lifts the ROPE, nods

respectfully at the habitual patron.

INT: EVENING - LIMELIGHT NIGHTCLUB - THE V.I.P. ROOM

LT arrives.

The V.I.P. ROOM is more laid-back, less populous than the

throng-filled cave outside. The MUSIC is muted here, and

more interesting.

PARTIERS sit at the BAR, or at COCKTAIL TABLES. CHIC WAITRONS

serve the clientele: HOTSHOT BOHEMIAN REGULARS, DRUG DEALERS

and HOPEFUL RICH ADDICTS. In the privacy of the V.I.P.ROOM,

drug use is hardly concealed.

LT sashays over to LITE'S table, sits down. LT has taken on

an attitude of false bravado. He greets LITE with a crazy

grin. LITE is grim, doesn't respond in kind. He's not amused.

LT orders a VODKA.

LT keeps doing COKE off hs wrist, even as ne speaks to LITE.

LT can't seem to wipe the smile off his face.

A COCKTAIL WAITRESS delivers LT's VODKA. LT orders another

one, flirts with her -- she's gone in a flash. LT downs the

VODKA in one shot.

This breaks LT up. He laughs until he cries. LITE watches

the spectacle. Falls silent. They sit quietly for a moment.

LT, impatient with the delivery of his second VODKA, takes a

bottle cut of his COAT and re-fills his GLASS. DRINKS it

down.

LITE tries changing the subject.

LT looks as LITE as if he's crazy. He shakes his head. Sing-

songs at him as if trying to teach an impaired student.

A change comes over LT. He leans in, gets seriously excited.

LT is possessed by his memory of this afternoon's game.

LT shakes his head. Repeats himself in that sing-song,

didactic way.

LITE stands up. He writes the BOOKIE'S NUMBER on a MATCHBOOK

and gives it to LT.

LITE leans over and gives LT a final warning.

LT LAUGHS. He's already onto the next thing. He checks out

the GIRLS at the other TABLES.

LITE takes to go. Then decides to try once more to get LT's

attention.

LT is still laughing as LITE leaves the V.I.P ROOM.

Before going out the door, LITE turns to look one more time

at his friend.

POV LITE - LT is engaged in a clumsy come-on. Oblivious. The

last thing LITE sees is LT grabbing a COCKTAIL WAITRESS' LEG

and falling out of his chair. LT LAUGHS all the way to the

FLOOR.

LITE lowers his head and exits.

LT gets up a moment later, brushes himself off, and swaggers

out of the V.I.P. ROOM.

INT: NIGHT - THE LIMELIGHT CLUB

LT is in the throng again. The MUSIC blasts, the PARTIERS

push and shove...

LT elbows his way through the crowd.

He makes moves on GIRLS. Banters with PATRONS. At the DOOR,

he hesitates before going out, dallies with the BOUNCER.

LT felt safe in the CLUB. New he's gotta go OUTSIDE. He's

shit-scared.

shoulder all the way.

INT: NIGHT - STAIRWELL OF J.C.'S APARTMENT BUILDING

LT enters an APARTMENT BUILDING, faces a dark and sinister

staircase.

STRANGE NOISES come from the APARTMENTS ABOVE.

LT climbs. He hugs the wall, GUN at the ready. To LT, it

seems some gothic horror may await him at any turn.

On one landing, he comes upon a PIT-BULL. A GRANDMOTHER pulls

him back inside an APARTMENT by the LEASH.

On another landing, he sees a JUNKIE SHOOTING UP in the

shadows. On another landing, a BIG GUY comes barreling out

of his APARTMENT and down the stairs, almost bringing LT

down with him.

On another landing, a guy is taking out very PECULIAR GARBAGE.

It might be body parts to an active imagination. At last, he

reaches the DOOR to the APARTMENT for which he's been looking.

INT: NIGHT - J.C.'S STRAIGHT PUERTO RICAN APARTMENT

A cheerful apartment. Quite different in atmosphere from the

STAIRWELL, above.

A large, multi-generation PUERTO RICAN FAMILY sits around

the dinner table, eating CHICKEN ON RICE AND BEANS. JC is at

the table.

RELIGIOUS ARTIFACTS abound.

A CODED KNOCK on the DOOR.

JC jumps up to answer it.

It's LT. (The hideous stairs led here.)

JC lets him in.

JC notes LT's bizarre manner. Decides to humor his paranoid

catatonia.

JC reaches into a bookcase, looking for something.

Meanwhile, LT looks around the room.

POV LT - A SHRINE is in the corner. CANDLES are lit before

PLASTER SAINTS, AFRICAN DEITIES, other icons abstruse and

exotic. A large "MADONNA AND CHILD", painted on black velvet,

hangs above the SHRINE. The MADONNA AND CHILD are BLACK.

LT takes this all in. JC startles him.

JC is holding a CIGAR BOX. He opens it. It's full of CASH.

JC hands it to LT.

MAMACITA takes some VIALS of CRACK out of her APRON.

SMILES. JC takes them from her, give them to LT.

LT nods, puts MAMACITA'S CRACK VIALS in his pocket. He notices

that --

POV LT - CU - The CIGAR BOX is inlaid with a CROSS, made of

costume jewels. Other strange symbols surround it. It could

be cursed -- or blessed.

LT turns to go. The DOOR closes behind him. He's gone.

EXT: NIGHT - STREET NEAR ARIANE'S APARTMENT

LT walks through the streets on the way to ARIANE'S. He

carries the CIGAR BOX.

Suddenly, a SHOT rings out.

ZOOM IN ON - CU LT  Horror. Doubtless it was meant for him.

LT panics. Freezes. As in a dream, he cannot run.

POV LT - RAPID. ERRATIC. HAND HELD - LT looks for SNIPERS in

the anonymous dark WINDOWS on the anonymous darks walls that

create the mescarole canyon of the STREET.

LT is entirely alone. He is stock-still, victim of his own

terror.

Suddenly. LT can move. He takes out his GUN, presses himself

against the nearest WALL. From that position, he hears --

A BRASH FEMALE VOICE, coming from somewhere in the darkness.

It is almost as loud as the "SHOT".

LT can't believe that there is no "SNIPER", there was never

any SHOT. It was a BACKFIRE!

ANGLE - The CAR in question passes by. It HONKS, defiantly.

Evidently, it is the CAR that had BACKFIRED.

LT is still pressed against the wall, GUN at the ready. He

cannot be relieved. The terror is with him.

INT: LATE NIGHT - ARIANE'S APARTMENT

LT rushes in, triple bolts the DOOR behind him. He immediately

pulls the DRAPES.

Ariane laughs.

LT turns on her. Adamant. Pleading with her to believe him.

ARIANE walks away, speaks with her back to LT.

LT lays his COAT down on the BED. Puts the CIGAR BOX of MONEY

under it.

LT sits down near the PHONE. He lights his CRACKPIPE with a

MATCH from the MATCHBOOK on which LITE wrote the BOOKIE'S

NUMBER. Then he tries to reach the BOOKIE. Some sort of wacky

Mob joint answers.

The MOB VOICE (CO) HANGS UP ON LT.

LT tries to strangle the PHONE.

LT REDIALS.

The line is BUSY.

LT makes the strangulation gesture again. ARIANE laughs at

him.

ARIANE pulls out a pristine NEEDLE.  LT comes but flinches

at the sight.

Apparently BOWTAY overheard that drugs are on the way. BOWTAY

appears out of the KITCHEN.

BOWTAY sits down near by, awaiting her DOSE.

ARIANE starts preparing the DOSE. She's got all the

paraphernalia: SPOON. COTTON, a CANDLE FLAME, etc.

That decides it for LT. He sits down like a little boy and

lets ARIANE shoot him up with the potent mixture of COCAINE

and HEROIN.

ARIANE shoots up BOWTAY, next.

They do it on the BED, exploiting all possible erotic

connotations.

When LT rushes, he gets totally paranoid. Jumps at sounds,

sneaks to the WINDOW, hears noises that aren't there.

Then he flips, and becomes crazy-bold. Opens the DRAPES.

Sticks his head out the WINDOW, waves his GUN at specters.

Then he becomes shit-scared, again. His behavior is lunatic.

ARIANE LAUGHS at his antics.

Finally LT becomes wildly sensual. Revealing himself with

total abandon. Dances. In the midst of this --

The PHONE RINGS LT is seriously startled. Then he realizes

who it may be. He slowly answers the phone.

LT can hardly speak. He is NUDE, and communicating from

another world syllable by syllable.

BIG SILENCE on the PHONE.

LT absorbs this, then bursts out.

LARGE takes a moment.

LT HANGS UP, turns to ARIANE.

ARIANE'S eyes light up.

ARIANE SHRUGS, waves his dig aside.

LT leaps up. He's on a manic roll. Conceives an insanely

captivating, impossible idea. As he speaks, he speeds more

and more until he seems to be reciting a rapid-fire tongue

twister perfect.

ARIANE has been grooving on it until now. She sees a problem

they've overlooked.

ARIANE LAUGHS, decides to go with it.

LT, out of breath from his tirade, lets the Downtown half of

his dose kick in but good.

He sits down in the same EASY CHAIR in which he nodded out

the morning of the desecration.

Nodding out, he stares out the same WINDOW. His eyes close.

As it was that morning only four days ago, the SUNRISE is

blood red.

As if it is LT'S DREAM, we --

INT: DAWN THROUGH HIGH NOON  CHURCH/CONVENT

CU - The ALABASTER NUN. She is lying cross -- probably has

been all night.

VARIOUS ANGLES. The still-desecrated CHURCH in all its

enduring glory. Shafts of blood-red dawn-light. The NUN.

TIME PASSES.

VARIOUS ANGLES. Mid-morning; The NUN is still lying cross.

TIME PASSES.

VARIOUS ANGLES. High Noon. The NUN is still lying cross.

Suddenly --

LT appears in the doorway, a black silhouette against the

white light of noon. For a moment, he watches her from a

distance.

The NUN knows he is there. After a time, she gets up, goes

to the altar, kneels. As if waiting for him.

LT staggers down the center aisle. He's carrying the CIGAR

BOX.

LT joins the NUN, kneeling next to her at the altar.

ANGLE - The CHALICE is still missing.

They are all alone. At the ALTAR, before the CRUCIFIX, LT

confronts the NUN face to face. The NUN holds her ROSARY

BEADS.

LT finally speaks. He thinks she'll be turned on by his offer

of "help".

The NUN turns to run.

LT is desperate. He lunges forward. Pleads with her.

The NUN turns to him, simple and pure, pure and simple.

This blows him away. He has nothing to say to that.

The NUN has finished her morning prayers.

For a moment, she looks deep into LT's eyes.

Then she gets up and leaves LT alone in the CHURCH.

LT comes face to face with the mammoth CRUCIFIX. He is

transfixed.

POV - LT - JESUS on the CROSS.

Soon, LT hears a VOICE.

LT is not shocked or even surprised. He speaks to JESUS as

to someone he's known all his life.

POV LT - The CRUCIFIX takes on an hallucinatory radiance.

Taking that aura with him, JESUS comes down off the CROSS,

and moves toward LT, who is still kneeling at the ALTAR.

JESUS kneels down, knee to knee, face to face with LT.

LT averts his eyes. When he looks up again --

JESUS is back on the CROSS. Inert, and yet --

LT rises, moves around the interior of the CHURCH. He

stumbles, struggles, pleads. Falls, rises, falls and rises

again -- as if wrestling with an invisible assailant.

He collapses in a corner.

EPIPHANY. BLOODY CHRIST ON THE CROSS. HALLELUJAH!

In the aftermath of his revelation, he notices, cleanly, a

hunched, ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN carrying something toward the

ALTAR.

He staggers toward her. Yes. The ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN has the

CHALICE!

LT grabs the CHALICE. The ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN doesn't let

go.

At first, she doesn't speak at all. LT begins to CRY. Begs

her to tell him. Then he wields his PISTOL, repeats his plea.

Then breaks into TEARS.

She speaks at last.

Gun in hand, LT gets down on his knees.

She meets LT's eyes, seems to understand something. Calmly,

she tells him what he needs to know.

The ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN lets go of the CHALICE. Now LT holds

ten CHALICE in his hands, alone. He speaks as if entranced.

Suddenly purposive, LT grabs the ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN by the

arm. Starts pulling her out of the CHURCH. He holds the

CHALICE with the other arm, picks up the CIGAR BOX on his

way out. Manages to carry both items.

When LT and the ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN reach the door to outside,

they both pause to GENUFLECT.

Then LT grabs her again and they rush out.

EXT: AFTERNOON - BARRIO STREETS - EN ROUTE TO THE FENCE

LT walks the ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN swiftly through the streets

toward the FENCE'S SHOP.

He still holds the CHALICE and the CIGAR BOX.

PEOPLE watch them pass and make way. As if they realize that

something is happening -- on several levels at once. The

GAME has begun. It is on TV in every BAR and SHOP WINDOW. In

both English and Spanish. Slowly but surely, the Mets are

losing.

INT: LATE AFTERNOON - THE FENCE'S SHOP

LT and the ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN enter the SHOP. LT is wielding

the CHALICE and the CIGAR BOX. He has true madness m his

eyes.

POV LT - The GAME is playing on a couple dozen TV's in the

FENCE'S SHOP' The Mets are still losing!

The FENCE, and elderly Black man, is sitting in one of many

EASY CHAIRS. He doesn't seem surprised to see his WIFE. Or

the CHALICE. Or LT! It's as if he expected them.

Th FENCE bursts out LAUGHING.

The ELDERLY BLACK WOMAN is obviously relieved.

LT speaks up suddenly.

After a beat, the FENCE and his WIFE start LAUGHING. LT joins

in.

The FENCE seems to study LT.

POV FENCE - LT. Wretched.

The FENCE thinks again.

POV LT - Through the WINDOW of the FENCE'S SHOP, a busy DRUG

CORNER is visible.

LT leaves. CHALICE in hand.

EXT: LATE AFTERNOON - THE STREETS IN THE BARRIO - MONTAGE

LT stumbles through the streets, questioning people about

"JULIO and PAOLO". No one knows anything. LT stops people at

random, getting really desperate. He shows people the CHALICE,

asks them if they've seen it before. No one has.

LT plays both ADDICT and COP as it suits his needs. By now,

he looks more like a homeless man than anything else. But

none of his play-acting or lethal threats get him anywhere.

The GAME is everywhere, and the Mets are still losing.

Finally, LT approaches a hustling STREET DEALER. He cops.

The STREET DEALER is wearing a WALKMAN, so the deal goes

down in mime.

Now, LT speaks and wants to be heard.

The STREET DEALER uses his WALKMAN and the resulting

"deafness" to excuse his total lack of response.

LT starts MOUTHING WORDS silently at the STREET DEALER. No

response. Then, he -- silently -- begins to shout.

The STREET DEALER's alarmed that he seemingly can't hear at

all above the WALKMAN music. He moves the WALKMAN away from

his ears but doesn't take it off.

LT points to a PUDDLE in which the STREET DEALER is now

Standing.

The STREET DEALER tries to consider what this crazy guy has

just told him, but before the STREET DEALER can even react.

LT leans in on him, shows his GUN and then his BADGE.

The STREET DEALER answers with absolute ease. That was all

it was about? No problem.

CU. LT - It hits him. The CRACKHOUSE where the kids hang out

has always been right next to the CHURCH/CONVENT where it an

began! It suddenly makes sense to him.

LT completes re transaction, pays the STREET DEALER for the

DRUG BAGS. He takes the CASH out of the CIGAR BOX, revealing

dozens of thousands of dollars.

The STREET DEALER stares at the wretched man with a box full

of cash.

EXT: EVENING - EN ROUTE TO THE CRACKHOUSE

LT, carrying the CHALICE and the CIGAR BOX, heads back

Downtown toward the CRACKHOUSE -- and the CHURCH/CONVENT.

In BARS, TV STORE WINDOWS, in snatches of strangers'

conversation, the FINAL GAME IS EVERYWHERE. The whole city

has stopped to watch it. LT is practically the only person

in the street.

Worst of all, the Mets are seriously behind. They are

definitely LOSING.

LT drags himself onward.

EXT INT: EVENING - THE CRACKHOUSE

LT busts in. Fires shots, collars the KIDS. The KIDS are

wearing the PURPLE ROBES from the CHURCH/CONVENT. They also

wear gold CROSSES. LT HANDCUFFS them.

The other CRACKHEADS race out.

There is even a TV in the CRACKHOUSE -- playing the GAME!

The SOUND is Off. The Mets keep losing. If anything will

force LT to kill/and or take the KIDS into custody, this

would seem to be it.

LT sits down next to the KIDS. SMOKES with them, watches the

Game. LT must hold the PIPE for them, as they are HANDCUFFED.

LT gets them super-high, and himself likewise. He still holds

his GUN.

The KIDS go along with it. Taking it moment to moment.

All three, despite the situation, are heavily into the Game.

After a moment, LT gets up. The KIDS understand that they

must do the same.

The KIDS hand over the PURPLE ROBES and LT puts them on.

LT exits. Taking the KIDS along. He carries the CHALICE and

the CIGAR BOX.

EXT INT: EVENING - LT'S CAR AND STREETS EN ROUTE TO RENDEZ-

VOUS

VARIOUS ANGLES - LT drives toward the fatal rendez-vous with

the BOOKIE. He is wearing the PURPLE ROBES from the

CHURCH/CONVENT and has the CHALICE and the CIGAR BOX.

LT has the KIDS handcuffed in the back seat. (The Scene

mirrors Scene 2. in which LT drove his own TWINS to school.)

The FINAL GAME (SEVEN) is on the RADIO. LT is listening, but

also not listening.

LT talks wildly about Jesus Christ. And about the misery

they pass in the street. He waves his GUN wildly, punctuating

his speech with potentially lethal gestures. He aims the GUN

at JULIO and PAULO, then at himself, then out the window,

then at the KIDS, again.

LT turns around and looks at JULIO and PAOLO, both of them

HANDCUFFED in the back seat.

POV LT - CU - JULIO and PAOLO both have TEARS running down

their cheeks. Silently.

LT starts CRYING too, at the same time CURSING at the TRAFFIC.

He drives wildly toward the Port Authority Terminal.

The Mets are coming up from behind -- but it is a long shot.

LT doesn't seem to care. He stares into space.

EXT:/INT: EVENING - LTS CAR - THE PORT AUTHORITY TERMINAL

LT stops his CAR -- next to a BUS in an underground tunnel.

The KIDS do. LT follows fast.

AT THE BUS: He makes them board at GUN POINT.

LT uncuffs them and the KIDS get on the BUS, dumbstruck.

LT hands JULIO the CIGAR BOX. His "salvation."

The KIDS don't even know what is inside. They take it.

LT gets back into his CAR, takes off.

EXT/INT: EVENING - LT'S CAR - AT 33RD STREET & 8TH AVENUE -

AT THE RENDEZ-VOUS WITH THE BOOKIE

EXT: LT PULLS UP AT THE APPOINTED SPOT. HE AWAITS THE

ARRIVAL OF THE BOOKIE.

INT: STRAWBERRY is up. The GAME can go either way. Suspense.

But not on the face of LT. He is dressed in the PURPLE ROBES,

the CHALICE beside him in the CAR.

The BOOKIE pulls up and -- without getting out of his CAR --

He SHOOTS LT in the head.

The BOOKIE speeds off. (We never saw him behind the dark

windows,} LT is dead in his CAR.

On the RADIO, the GAME is ending. STRAWBERRY hits a HOME RUN

and the -- Mets win, the CROWD ROARS.

END CREDITS.
