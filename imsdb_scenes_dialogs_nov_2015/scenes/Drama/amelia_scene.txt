INT. DENISON HOUSE, BOSTON - DAY

SAM CHAPMAN, a handsome young man is being led down an

institutional hallway and out onto the grounds of this

venerable settlement house. He finds...

...Amelia sitting cross-legged on the grass. Reading to a

group of CHINESE GIRLS, who hang on her every animated word.

On the periphery, ADULTS sit, taking in the story. They are

of various ethnicities, homeless or handicapped or immigrant.

Two are blind. Amelia sees Sam...

The Octopus Club waves to Sam.   The adults wave, too.

She pats the grass beside her.   Sam has no choice but to sit.

EXT. GROUNDS - LATER

Amelia and Sam walk a wooded path beside the grounds.

Through the chain link fence, they watch other social workers

playing with groups of children.

She looks over.

She gives him a sweet playful smile.   It doesn't reassure

him.

He stops walking.

She gazes at him.   Can he even hear this?

INT. WALDORF ASTORIA HOTEL - DAY

MOVIETONE NEWSREEL footage, accompanied by their signature

fanfare theme. Hotel conference room jammed with press. A

sexy brunette in a sweater that seems to be made of strips of

GOLD FOIL steps to a bank of microphones. Flashes start

POPPING.

The sound switches to Mabel at the mikes...

The boys ROAR.   Mabel keeps her smile tight.

As the laughter CONTINUES...

INT. HANGAR, EAST BOSTON AIRPORT - NIGHT

brightly-lit hangar to see two men working on the FRIENDSHIP,

a sea-plane with golden wings. Its red-orange fuselage

stands beside gigantic PONTOONS, each 29 feet long. The

pontoons have been opened, and the men are attaching them to

the plane.

They turn toward us now. BILL STULTZ is short and wiry with

quick eyes. Only 28, he seems weathered by his adventures

and the streaks of gray through his hair. He is not

necessarily happy to see us.

George waves as we approach.   Bill and Amelia seem locked on

each other.

Bill doesn't smile.   The other man does...

She is shaking hands in that strong, direct way.

She takes Bill's powerful hand. The look between them calm,

yet somehow intense. As if each is establishing a tone for

their relationship.

Bill's small smile.   Maybe the girl's all right.

EXT. DOCK - LATER

George and Amelia approach a waiting motorboat, as the lights

of Boston glimmer across the harbor. His head is down.

She's watching his profile.

H

No reaction from him. He hops into the boat. Turns, holds

out his hand. She hesitates. Clearly doesn't need his help

to jump into a boat. Their eyes lock. We are watching her

decide. And then...

She reaches to clasp his hand.   Hops down beside him.

Her smile is friendly, not flirtatious. She goes to sit in

the bow. He doesn't follow. But he is watching.

EXT. ROOF, COPLEY PLAZA HOTEL - DAY

Amelia in a flying outfit.   Hands on her hips as if posing.

PULL BACK to see the PHOTOGRAPHER, George beside him. They

are on a hotel rooftop, precariously high above Boston.

She glances to where a WOMAN, beautiful and aristocratic, is

being helped onto the roof. George's face lights to see her.

He rushes over, sweeps her into his arms, kisses her

tenderly. Amelia smiles to see this, makes her like them

both.

The women trade smiles.   They shake hands, holding eye

contact.

George steps in close, and the photographer SNAPS a three-

shot. And another.

EXT. JEFFREY YACHT CLUB HARBOR, EAST BOSTON - EARLY LIGHT 15

The FRIENDSHIP bobbing on its pontoons. Bill and Slim are

off-loading equipment and other gear from the plane to a

TUGBOAT filled with support crew and family. The plane's

engines REV in the predawn stillness. PULL BACK to see...

EXT. YACHT CLUB DOCK - EARLY LIGHT

...the yacht club dock. George and Amelia alone at the

railing. She's wearing her leather flight jacket and boots.

They stare out at the plane, so frail and awkward. From her

bag now, she pulls three ENVELOPES...

Puts them in George's hand.   Straight, unblinking...

H

She sighs.

A held look.     A friendly...

She walks off down the dock toward the Friendship.

INT. SMALL HOTEL, NEWFOUNDLAND - MORNING

Amelia alone, leaving her hotel room in her flight jacket.

Locking the door.

SUPERIMPOSE:     FIRST STOP: CANADA

She walks briskly down the corridor.

Turns a corner.      Approaches the dining room door.

She enters the hotel dining room. Stops cold. Across the

room a disgruntled Bill and a sheepish Slim stare at her from

their breakfast, surrounded by 15 REPORTERS and

PHOTOGRAPHERS. Holy shit. Half a dozen CAMERAS RISE as one.

It is a defining moment. And Amelia...

Cocks her head.      Throws an effortless golden smile.

The FLASHES EXPLODE as one.   They keep POPPING as Amelia

makes her way to them.

The reporters are handing her their morning editions. The

New York Times front page headline: BOSTON GIRL STARTS FOR

ATLANTIC HOP.

There beneath the headline, the glamorous PHOTO we watched

being taken on the Copley Hotel roof, Lady Lindy. Next to

it, an earlier photo of her as a demure social worker.

A

shaking her head.

The boys ROAR, Slim louder than anyone. Even Bill cracks a

smile. They're shouting, teasing, YOU CAN'T KID US!

The boys make room.   Bill rises to hold Amelia's chair.    A

friendly murmur...

INT. WALDORF-ASTORIA HOTEL - DAY

MOVIETONE NEWSREEL footage, accompanied by their signature

fanfare theme. Once more, the hotel conference room jammed

with press. Today Mabel wears a luxurious silver fox coat,

shimmies up to a bank of microphones at the podium. Flashes

start POPPING.

She snuggles the gleaming fox fur around her.

EXT. HARBOR, TREPASSEY, NEWFOUNDLAND - EARLY MORNING

MOVIETONE NEWSREEL CONTINUES. We are looking at foggy, bleak

Trepassey Harbor as the Friendship makes an unsuccessful

attempt to take off.

S

The plane's engine SPUTTERS and STALLS.     It floats on the

sea.

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR, NEWFOUNDLAND - LATE NIGHT

Amelia coming down the hotel corridor. She passes a room,

and hearing DRUNKEN LAUGHTER from a group of MEN within the

room...

She stops.    Stares at the door with more concern than anger.

INT. ROOM - SAME MOMENT

Bill, Slim and three of the REPORTERS are drinking up a

storm.

INT. HOTEL ROOM, NEWFOUNDLAND - LATER

Amelia curled up on her bed with CHARTS of the Atlantic

spread everywhere. From next door, the sound of drunken men

CONTINUE.

Amelia looks down from her charts.       Her mind going to...

FLASHBACK:       EXT. HOUSE, ATCHISON, KANSAS - DAY

Seven-year-old KIDS dressed as cowboys and Indians are

gathered on the front lawn of a white clapboard home. We

CLOSE on a clear-eyed tomboy with war paint and tousled hair,

AMELIA at seven, looking up excitedly as a car pulls to the

curb.

H

the lawn. The kids part to let him through, the confusion

and disappointment on every face. He ignores them all, even

Amelia. The front door opens...

...Amelia's MOTHER gazes at him with shame and disdain.         As

she helps him stagger inside...

INT. HOTEL ROOM - EARLY MORNING

Amelia in her flight gear, sitting on the edge of her bed, an

open TELEGRAM lies beside her. Her elbows rest on her knees.

Her hands are locked together. Her profile is stony,

determined. TILT DOWN to the telegram...

It reads:    WEATHER PERMITTING, MABEL FLIES THIS AFTERNOON.

She grabs her flight bag, leaves the room. She only has to

travel as far as the next door. POUNDS on it. Waits.

Pounds LOUDER with both fists.

Slim opens the door.      Looking bad.   Bill sits up in bed,

groggy, disoriented.

A beat. Slim goes, the door shuts quietly.     Amelia sits on

the edge of Bill's bed.

Her eyes are burning with this.    And Bill keeps quiet.

Anyone would.

She leans closer.

Just above a whisper...

Y

EXT. TREPASSEY HARBOR - LATER

It's dark and cold. Bill and Amelia stand at the dock beside

their plane. He's drinking coffee as they watch Slim come

down the quay with a slip of paper in his hand. Amelia steps

forward to take it. Reads with neutral eyes.

She still hasn't given the paper to Bill. Slim steps onto a

pontoon. Starts CRANKING up the propellers. As the engine

KICKS to life...

S

She hands the weather report to Bill.    He reads.   Looks to

her eyes.

She motions to Slim, get on board. The navigator grins,

starts to climb up, looking back at Bill...

She climbs up after him.   One look back...

And disappears. Alone on the dock, Bill hears the engines

REV. Jesus, God, she's going to do it. He takes a step

toward the plane, but her head appears in the hatch...

Her perfectly straight, innocent face.    He BUSTS out

laughing. This fucking girl.

T

INT. FRIENDSHIP - MOMENTS LATER

WITH Amelia as she locks the hatch. For the first time, we

can see the inside of the plane. The cabin is too small for

anyone to stand. The plane has been emptied of everything

but two huge elliptical FUEL TANKS.

the throttle and the Fokker Tri-motor LURCHES forward,

STRAINING against the surface of the sea in a rattling,

throbbing desperately VIBRATING all-out attempt.

Amelia crawls to the tiny window, her face to the glass as

chop and spray FLY PAST like shrapnel, and the engines WHINE

and PULSE louder...

...twenty seconds, thirty. Still on the surface. Forty

seconds, fifty, her eyes shut, her forehead bangs against the

glass, come on, sixty seconds, and at 67...

EXT. HARBOR - SAME MOMENT

...the seaplane LIFTS, struggles, then SOARS FREE.

INT. FRIENDSHIP - DAY/NIGHT

Amelia kneels at the tiny window. A kid on a rainy day.

Only outside this window is impenetrable FOG and a STORM that

ROCKS the plane like the shock waves of endless explosions.

As she braces herself against the hull...

...water DRIPS onto her from a loose seam. Could this be

dangerous? She looks around. Through the opening between

the elliptical fuel tanks...

...Bill and Slim at the controls. Bill is banging on

something beside the instrument panel. Beneath his seat, she

sees the TOOLBOX. The water drips on her faster. She crawls

forward toward the boys, arriving to see...

...Bill POUNDING what we can now see is his RADIO.   His face

is red, angry. She watches for a beat.

He never turns to her, but she studies him. Is he impaired

or simply frustrated? She slips the toolbox from beneath his

seat and crawls back to the leak. But as she opens the

box...

...there, among the wrench and pliers, a BOTTLE of whiskey.

She stares at it as we SNAP TO...

FLASHBACK:    EXT. AMELIA'S HOUSE, ATCHISON, KANSAS - DAY

RAPID SERIES OF ANGLES. War-painted Amelia looking up from

the cowboy she's tied to a tree. The car pulling to the

curb. Out climbs...

...her FATHER glassy-eyed.   Stumbling through the children.

Her MOTHER at the door.

ANGLE. Amelia still in war paint enters her parents' room

She knows just where to go. Opens a drawer, digs beneath

crisply starched shirts. Finds the BOTTLE.

ANGLE. Amelia in the bathroom, POURING the bottle out into

the sink. She looks up in the mirror to see...

...her father in the doorway. She turns straight to him.

MEETS his eyes, direct and unafraid.

INT. FRIENDSHIP

BACK to Amelia with Bill's bottle, as the battered plane

lurches every which way in the storm. She lifts it from the

toolbox. Hides it in the camera bag, as suddenly the plane

DROPS fifty feet, and Amelia is SLAMMED against the ceiling,

then crashes back to the floor. Dazed, she sees Bill turned

around...

She GRABS the leg of the navigation table which has been

bolted down. Stares out the window, wondering if she'll make

it.

HOLD on the gray eyes.   DISSOLVE TO...

LATER. Amelia at the window, still opaque with fog.

Suddenly, the plane SWOOPS down toward a clearing in the

clouds. There to the south, a FREIGHTER running across our

path. No land in sight.

A

bag, and crawls back to the boys.

The boys are studying the freighter.

Her face drawn, she almost seems to be holding her breath.

Something down below. As we drop, we hear the engines

SPUTTER.

She glances over to Slim, who is busy unwrapping a sandwich.

She can't believe this. He takes a healthy bite.

She crawls back to the navigation table. As she looks out

her window, a SANDWICH SAILS past! She WHIPS around...Slim's

arms raised in jubilation. Down below...

Land.

EXT. SHORE, BURRY PORT, WALES - DAY

The little plane sputtering, shuddering, as Bill drops in for

a splashdown. We PAN to the shore...

...a rural railroad dock. Deserted except for THREE WORKERS

who glance up as the Friendship taxis to a buoy a few hundred

yards offshore. Amelia at the hatch, tiny in distance, WAVES

a towel...

...one friendly worker takes off his coat and WAVES back.

Then all three guys go back to work. SNAP TO...

REVERSE ANGLE. From the Friendship, we watch the workers

ignoring us. Bill and Slim HOLLER and jump up and down on

the pontoons. Nobody cares. Amelia sits in the doorway, her

legs swinging free.

LATER. Amelia alone. Six pages written by her side. Still

working, as a rowboat pulls up. Bill stands in the bow.

Calls to her...

She looks at him as they are jostled along.

She is brought to a smiling avuncular HILTON RAILEY, standing

beside the closest thing Burry Port has to a limo. She

throws an affectionate arm around him, kisses his cheek.

Railey stands back as FLASHBULBS catch the moment.   He's

brought photographers with him. And more.

A hearty handshake.   She holds out her sheets of paper.

Both men regard the pages as if they were gold bullion.     Come

for these indeed.

EXT. SOUTHAMPTON - DAY

MOVIETONE FOOTAGE of Amelia being welcomed by a SEA OF PEOPLE

on the dock at Southampton. A mob . Folks spilling into the

water. Ships circling, fireboats spray, every craft BLARES

its horn. Police hold back the screaming throng as FLASHES

EXPLODE and NEWSREEL CAMERAS CHURN. Amelia at the center of

the storm. Welcomed by AMY GUEST and the lady LORD MAYOR of

Southampton.

Throughout, we see SUPERIMPOSED IMAGES of the article she

gave Railey, displaying her byline, on the front pages of the

London Times, New York Times, the Times of India, Sydney

Morning Herald, the Toronto Star, Le Monde, as her story

echoes around the world. These IMAGES CONTINUE OVER...

QUICK SERIES OF ANGLES. Amelia cheering animatedly at the

races...watching tennis at Wimbledon...front row gallery at

the House of Commons, as...

INT. HYDE PARK HOTEL, LONDON - DAY

MOVIETONE NEWSREEL CONTINUES. The British press are gathered

in a huge Victorian parlor. Dark woods, rich leather, a bank

of microphones, an electric expectancy...

Bill and Slim stand next to a seated Amy.    Amelia steps to

the microphones...

Amelia stares at the man.    Conflicting agendas.

Such calm self-possession.    Such confidence in that.

S

P            the pioneer is a man or woman.

She nods.    To them, to herself.

EXT. BROADWAY, NEW YORK CITY - DAY

Ticker tape PARADE down Broadway, crowds lining the streets,

leaning from windows to welcome Amelia home.

Amelia sits in an open car between Bill and Slim, WAVING to

everyone. In the front seat, George and Dorothy share the

moment.

EXT. RECEPTION HALL - DAY

Amelia flanked by George and Dorothy, coming out of a

reception hall. Amelia glances to George...

Dorothy wonders.       Letters?

One simple shake of Amelia's head.       A soft...

He smiles.       Bows in submission.

And Dorothy.   Watches this, too.

EXT. PUTNAM HOME, RYE, NEW YORK - DAY

Amelia in a sunlit garden ringed by trees. She sits at a

folding table, writing longhand. A large dog lies at her

feet.

PULL BACK to see our view has been George's. He sits at an

antique writing desk, watching her through a picture window.

He rises slowly. We see that he has been reviewing a

CONTRACT, which he takes with him.

A

the back porch steps to the garden.

He smiles as he approaches.   She goes back to work.

He drops the contract on her table.     She looks at it.

Oh.   His smile simple, comfortable.

She stares at him with hard eyes. His smile just becomes

more relaxed. An easy win, no big deal. She begins to sign

the contract. He places a stack of letters in front of her.

She starts to read.    Her eyes widen.   Goodness.

They look up.   She has a tray of lemonade and cookies.

INT. AUDITORIUM, BARNARD COLLEGE, NEW YORK - NIGHT

A women's college.    The hall is packed.

Amelia and George alone in the wings.

Staring at each other.

The stare holds.   Because this is the moment.

It is only one step.     Her hand goes to his chest.    Her eyes

close, as...

She brings her mouth to his.     Tender and strong.    And deep.

It is an act of decision.

A held look. No one smiles. We hear her name ANNOUNCED from

the podium. But she keeps looking at him. And as the

APPLAUSE CONTINUES, she finally...

...turns. STRIDES onto the stage, with one graceful wave,

she brings the applause to a crescendo.

She steps to the microphone.     The crowd quiets.

INTERCUT.   George in the wings.    His heart in his eyes.

He looks down.   He's still holding her cards.

INT. HOTEL, CHICAGO - DAY

Hotel corridor. An elevator OPENS and ELINOR SMITH a

striking young woman emerges. Looks at a slip of paper.

Nervous. Heads down the hallway to a door. As she gathers

herself to knock, she looks scared enough to pass out.

Inadvertently, her eyes flick to the bedroom door. Catching

this, our couple shares a dry smile. The kid sees that. Uh-

oh.

Now our couple is trying not to laugh.

The honesty, the suddenness, leave George atypically

dumbstruck.

The girl nods, seriously.    Okay.

INT. PUTNAM HOUSE - CHRISTMAS DAY

Holiday party in progress. Christmas decorations everywhere.

A small crowd around the living room bar where George is

telling a story.

Now we see Dorothy standing, drinking, watching George with

hard eyes. She turns on her heels and walks OUT into the

garden. George sees this, excuses himself, follows her, as

we PAN to...

...Amelia standing with a group of guests.    She's seen it

all.

EXT. GARDEN - MOMENTS LATER

Here she comes along the roses, still drinking, still fuming.

A figure comes up behind her. Falls in step.

Still walking.   She never looks at him.

She finishes her drink. Throws the glass away. From our

ANGLE we can now see D

She stops walking.   Turns in shock, to see his easy smile.

She GLARES at him, and storms off. He lets her go. Hear a

car engine TURN OVER. Dorothy PEELING OUT. George reflects.

As he walks back toward the party, he now sees Amelia in the

window. He stops. Their look holds.

INT. KITCHEN - LATE NIGHT

George at the kitchen table in dim light. It's very late. A

HAND places a steaming mug of coffee before him. Followed by

a slice of pie. A fork. He smiles. And softly...

She sits beside him.     Very close.

She looks at him.   Squints.    How?

Oh.   A breath.

He seems so sunny and strong.     What can he be feeling?

S

He stops her with a kiss.

He stares in her troubled eyes.   There is no answer.

EXT. AIRFIELD - DAY - NEWSREEL

Amelia and nearly 20 WOMEN lined up in front of planes.

Waving, smiling, talking to each other.

The next ANGLE shows Amelia watching some of her colleagues

bouncing playfully on a see-saw. She smiles tolerantly, but

maybe there's a little too much cheesecake for her taste.

INT. RECEPTION AREA, PUTNAM'S - DAY

The crowded waiting room. We CLOSE on a young woman we

scarcely recognize. It is Elinor. Though less than a year

has passed, she seems much older. Sophisticated, poised.

ANGLE. A secretary leads Elinor down the corridor to

George's office. As they enter, George is pacing on the

phone.              G

Listens, impatient.

INT. OAK ROOM, PLAZA HOTEL, NEW YORK - NIGHT

LONG ANGLE. Sophisticated watering hole. Crowded tonight.

PAN to find George alone, waiting. A waiter leads Amelia to

the table. George stands, smiling. But the smile is not

returned. We CLOSE as they sit...

Oh.

She can scarcely believe this.

It is.

INT. GEORGE'S MOTHER'S HOME, NOANK, CONNECTICUT - DAY

Through a window, a dry, wintered garden. Snow falling, at

once soft and heavy. Beyond, Morgan Point Lighthouse,

Fisher's Island Sound, Long Island Sound. One lonely fishing

boat braves the cold water. PULL BACK to see...

...Amelia at the breakfast table in a windowed room.     She is

writing, and as she does...

S

...her eyes are swimming with tears.     She brushes at them.

Stares down at her work. Continues.

ANGLE. The parlor. George, his MOTHER, the MINISTER, a

small number of close FRIENDS. From the doorway, Amelia

beckons George. The letter is in her hand.

EXT. HOME - MOMENTS LATER

Amelia holds tight to George's hand, leading him out into the

falling snow. She turns, fixes him with a look. Hands him

the letter. And steps back. As if giving him space.

At first, he smiles. What is this? She gestures for him to

read. As he begins, there is nothing for a few seconds.

Then...

Snow falling.    Absolute silence.

She gazes intently, her heart in her eyes.     He never looks

up.

And then...

He stops on this.    His thoughts unreadable.

He folds the letter carefully.    Places it in his pocket.       And

smiles.

He steps to her.    Looks in her eyes.   They kiss.

INT. PARLOR - LATER

LONG ANGLE. The minister reading the vows. The witnesses

standing silent. Two black cats rubbing against George's

ankles.

INT. KITCHEN, RYE - MORNING

George at the breakfast table. His eggs and toast ignored

for the moment, he's reading a magazine article. PAN to

Amelia, sipping her coffee. Watching him.

He looks up to her.

Silence.

Ah.   He nods.

He butters his toast.

EXT. GARDEN, RYE - DAY

CLOSE on Amelia as she kneels, carefully putting new plants

into the ground. We see patience, concentration.

Contentment. After a moment...

WIDEN ANGLE.     George kneeling beside her.   Happily planting

his own.

He looks at her work. Reaches over. Starts packing the

earth HARDER around her plant. She just watches, then...

She reaches to his plant and starts LOOSENING the soil...

No one cracks a smile. It's like Laurel and Hardy in a food

fight where each lets the other take his best shot. George

reaches now, starts REPACKING her soil...

She SMACKS his hand. He just keeps working. She finally

grins, smacks him HARDER. He doesn't seem to notice.

EXT. TEETERBORO AIRPORT - DUSK

AERIAL ANGLE. In the sun's last light, two figures walk

slowly, far below us. The Vega waits.

CLOSE ANGLE. They stand beneath the wing. Her ground crew

in far distance, giving them their moment. Her look is not

breezy and cavalier this time, but tender and intimate. She

knows the fear beneath his easy smile.

He produces a RING, a band of black fibers.

He puts it in her hand.

Amelia looks at the ring.   Turns it in her fingers.

And.

She leans up to kiss him. And again.    Feeling in her eyes

that he will never forget.

INT. VEGA - NIGHT

Amelia alone. Starry night.   12,000 feet below are ICEBERGS.

A single fishing boat.

Ahead, towering CLOUDS in moonlight.   Too high to fly over.

EXT. VEGA - LATER

A terrifying STORM BATTERS the plane, which bobs and darts

and dips like a leaf in a gale.

INT. VEGA - SAME MOMENT

Amelia fights for control as the plane is TOSSED and SHAKEN.

And the Vega DIVES into a DIZZYING SPIN.

EXT. VEGA - SAME MOMENT

The SPINNING plane PLUNGING...

And ARCING at last to SWOOP above the whitecaps.   Way close

for comfort. SMASH CUT TO...

INT. VEGA - SAME MOMENT

Amelia REELING in her seat, her fingers FUMBLING in her

flight bag, for...

...SMELLING SALTS, she inhales, again, blinks, starts to

climb...

T

HOURS LATER. Amelia seriously fatigued. She breaks through

cloud into DAZZLING SUNLIGHT, and blinks, blinded.

The FUEL GAUGE reads EMPTY. She switches on the RESERVE

TANK. And as she DROPS back down into opaque clouds...

...she feels something. Her fingertips go to her left

shoulder, and come away...

Wet.   Slick.

She looks around helplessly for a way to stem the dripping.

LATER. Amelia beyond exhaustion. Staring fixedly at some-

thing we can't see. Until we PAN through the wind screen to

the leak in the manifold weld. The BLUE FLAME is startlingly

LARGER, now LICKING its way along the surface of the

fuselage...

INT. GEORGE'S OFFICE - DAY

Arms folded, George stares out his window. He hasn't slept

or eaten. PAN to his desk. The phone is OFF the hook. The

door opens softly...

He turns and looks at her. The girl's eyes go down and he

BOLTS to the phone, SNATCHES the receiver, SLAMS the

button...

A full beat.

EXT. SKY - DAY

A plane swooping downward through cloud and fog.   The SOUND

of George's call CONTINUES...

LOWER, it's dropping fast, maybe too fast, WOBBLES in a

crosswind, here comes the GROUND, and...

...the Vega RIGHTS itself and GLIDES in for as fine a landing

as a bumpy meadow could allow. COWS look up as she rolls

past, toward...

...one lone astonished FARM WORKER.   She cuts her engines,

leans from the hatch...

A blink.   The truth...

O

Oh.

EXT. NEW YORK HARBOR- DAY

MOVIETONE NEWSREEL FOOTAGE of Amelia arriving at New York

Harbor to an overwhelming reception.

The MAYOR, the GOVERNOR, every dignitary that could get an

invitation is there to greet her.

As she waves to the crowd...

INT. BACKSTAGE, CONSTITUTIONAL HALL, WASHINGTON, D.C. - NIGHT

We are standing in the wings. Through the curtains, we

GLIMPSE the eager, packed house in an auditorium. From the

stage, a speaker DRONES, but backstage...

...George peeks out at the throng. When he looks back, we

see Amelia, her troubled face. The folded newspaper in her

hand.

INT. TRAIN - DAY

A train rumbles through countryside.    A private compartment

finds Amelia staring out the window.    George studying her.

REVERSE ANGLE. Through the glass of our compartment door, a

crowd stands jouncing against each other. Gazing at their

Queen of the Skies.

Said lightly. Not even looking at him.     While through the

glass, it's become quite a tussle.

One woman goes flying from view, as a younger one gets her

place.

He stares in her eyes.   Almost as if looking for something.

Their look holds.

INT. RESTAURANT, BOSTON - NIGHT

PAN the dark, elegant restaurant. In a corner by the fire-

place, Amelia and her dinner companions are being served

lobsters. GENE VIDAL leans to Amelia as he speaks, and she

hangs on every word.

A lean athlete's body, easy grace in every movement.

Strikingly handsome features that convey not only intellect,

but kindness and decency.

She's trying to crack her lobster, but can't take her eyes

off her host.

She's making a real mess of the lobster.    Gene notices.   PAUL

COLLINS doesn't...

Gene reaches over, as if it were his own plate, and begins

cracking her lobster for her. She looks in his eyes and

tries to concentrate.

Her soft smile.

Serious indeed.

She can't smile anymore.     Because this is the very fear she

lives with.

Silence.

INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - LATER

Walking together down the hallway of her hotel. No one

speaks. Their thoughts are their own. She reaches her room,

finds her key. Opens the door, and...

...turns to him. A brief, direct look.       She reaches one hand

gently behind his head. Leans up.

K

isses his mouth.

His eyes question.

H

There is no smile. Without a word, she goes into her room.

CLOSES the door behind her.

Walks away.

INT. BANQUET HALL, WASHINGTON - NIGHT

Crowded hall, each table ringed by diners in formal dress.

At a table of honor, George sits next to Elinor Smith,

chatting comfortably. PAN to the head table...

CLOSE on ELEANOR ROOSEVELT, eating heartily, chatting,

laughing with a companion we don't see until...

...we reveal Amelia in a formal satin dress at her side,

dishing with the First Lady like the closest of girlfriends.

INT. CONDOR AIRLINER - LATER

Raucous party in the small cabin, hosted by George and fueled

.

by champagne. PAN slowly to...

and formal gloves. Eleanor in the co-pilot's seat, awestruck

by the brilliant starry night. Amelia glances over, moved by

her friend's almost childlike wonder.

Eleanor looks over.   Are you serious?

Hesitation.

And slowly, Eleanor's fingers close on her wheel.     Amelia's

hands come away from hers.

The Condor purrs along through the night air. The moon bobs

slightly off to one side. Eleanor's eyes are swimming with

the thrill of this.

And stands up. Only the trace of her smile as the pilot's

eyes WIDEN in absolute shock.

INT. WHITE HOUSE PRESS ROOM - DAY

A sea of press, quiet, poised, attentive.     REVERSE ANGLE

to...

...CLOSE on a seated Roosevelt before a bank of microphones.

PAN to Gene at his side.   Sober.   Distinguished.   Proud.

EXT. PUTNAM HOME, RYE - EVENING

A taxi slowly pulls up to the home we know. Warmly lit,

music playing from within. Gene climbs from the cab, as yard

lights go ON.

As Gene starts up the path, the front door opens and Amelia

BURSTS into the night, RUNNING to Gene, JUMPING INTO his

arms, HUGGING him in her delight. We PULL BACK to...

George watching it all from the doorway.    His easy smile

seems comfortably in place, as...

...Amelia walks Gene up the path, her arm around his waist,

talking excitedly, flushed as a schoolgirl. As they reach

the door...

George is the picture of calm and dignity. He beams and

CLASPS Gene's hand. Throws an arm around his shoulder as

Amelia leads them inside.

The door closes.   We hear laughter.

EXT. GARDEN, RYE - DAY

Amelia on her knees, tending to her garden. She seems happy

and filled with energy. George comes and kneels beside her.

Starts weeding.

A long held look.       Neither backing away.   Sadness on both

sides.

She sighs.       Her fingers reach out, rub his hand with

affection.

He nods.   Well, then.      Rises slowly...

Walks back toward the house, his garden tools forgotten.          She

stares after him.

H

EXT. LOS ANGELES COLISEUM - DAY

MOVIETONE NEWSREEL FOOTAGE introduced by its theme. A

stadium in brilliant sunlight, filled with more than 100,000

people.

On the track, WOMEN RUN the 100 meter high hurdles as every

throat CHEERS.

TIGHT INSERT of Amelia with Gene and 8-year-old GORE, all

applauding excitedly.

The camera lingers as Amelia says something to Gore.     They

look like a family.

INT. GEORGE'S OFFICE, NEW YORK - DUSK

CLOSE on George alone in his office.    He goes to the door,

LOCKS it. His face is drawn, grim.

He goes slowly back to his desk.   On it, sits a large

cardboard CARTON.

We SEE that the contents of the box, papers, small objects,

have been SINGED or CHARRED. He stares into it.

He reaches into the box...

INT. LOS ANGELES HOME - DAY

Amelia curled up on the sofa of a cozy, pleasant little home.

The doors are open to the patio and yard. Winter is

different here. Tropical flowers, fruit trees in bloom. The

phone RINGS and she picks it up quickly, knowing it's George.

INTERCUT George at his office. He's standing at the window,

phone in one hand, single sheet of paper in the other. Like

the other objects in the box, it is partially singed.

Draws a breath.     Reads...

BACK to Amelia.     Tears fill her eyes.

INTERCUT George.     His eyes are dry.

A beat.   His voice still softer...

HOLD on him.     The pain of what that must mean.    And...

BACK TO LOS ANGELES

Her lips are parted.       She's searching for words.

WIDEN ANGLE. Gene enters the room with a drink in his hand

and sits down next to her, concerned by her obvious distress.

She hangs up slowly. The tears begin to fall.    She looks at

Gene helplessly. Then stands without a word.

Walks out into the yard.

EXT. NEWARK AIRPORT - NEWSREEL FOOTAGE - NIGHT

Spectators at Newark Airport. A plane CIRCLES the field as

FLOOD LIGHTS FLASH ON, and the crowd begins to CHEER. Arcing

in now for a landing. Smooth trajectory.

Touching down, the cheering CROWD held back by police. As

Amelia taxies to a stop, the crowd BREAKS THROUGH police

lines and SURGES toward the plane.

Amelia hops down from the plane, grinning and waving.   She is

surrounded by adoring fans.

The JOSTLING of the crowd gets out of control, the police

can't protect her as she is SWEPT ALONG by the mob, beaming,

laughing, enjoying it all.

INT. MAYFLOWER HOTEL BAR, WASHINGTON, D.C. - NIGHT

Dark little piano bar. They sit in a quiet corner, com-

fortable in silence. Gene with his martini, Amelia with her

Coke. She's shelling peanuts from a bowl, popping some in

her mouth, passing a few over to him.

S            Aeronautics Branch.

She stands up.

Walks out.       Gene makes no move to follow.   He's said his

piece.

EXT. ROSE GARDEN, WHITE HOUSE - DAY

MOVIETONE NEWSREEL FOOTAGE introduced by its theme. Against

a backdrop of flowerbeds, Amelia is flanked by four WOMEN

with conservative hats and middle-aged gravitas. The

photographers edge closer.

She waits for the press to quiet.

The winsome smile.

And now it fades.

She is not defiant.      Gentle and strong.

The smallest shake of her head.

INT. WOMEN'S DORMITORY, PURDUE UNIVERSITY - NIGHT

They fill the old couches, the mismatched easy chairs, curl

up in blankets on the floor. PAN TO...

...Amelia in flannel pajamas, sitting on the grand piano,

pointing to the next question among the many raised hands.

Laughter.   The girl flushes a little, her point is a crucial

one...

She meant that.      And no one is laughing now.

She hangs up. Turns to her adoring pupils, and drops a

curtsy. Ta-da! They APPLAUD. She stares at them. As if

deciding whether to say...

They can.   And boy, do they want to hear one.

They are nodding, wide-eyed, go on.

They hold their breath.

A frozen beat for them to even absorb this. They BURST into

WILD APPLAUSE, Amelia beaming, as we DISSOLVE TO...

EXT. PARK AVENUE, NEW YORK - NIGHT

Amelia and George, bundled against the cold, walking Park

Avenue hand in hand. Christmas decorations, bright lights.

A good mood prevails.

Well, then?

He looks in her eyes.

She grins.

It's not?    Uh-uh.   And he glances to...

...the window of the GALLERY they've stopped at. She sees a

magnificently carved CHEST. On a crest in the front: AE.

We PAN the surface, to see planes, oceans, a shamrock for the

Londonderry landing, dozens more symbols of her triumphs, and

in a bottom corner, looking up at all of this in wonder...

...a small cat.     In a long frock coat.

Her tears just come. She's standing on Park Avenue and she

can't do anything about it. He reaches a tender hand...

...and strokes her hair.      He is her hero.   See it in her

eyes.

She sniffles.

INT. HOME, RYE - DAY

Amelia at her writing desk.       Determined, focused.   She begins

to write...

A

INT. DINING ROOM, PURDUE UNIVERSITY - NIGHT

A glittering table surrounded by high rollers. George and

President Elliot sit on either side of Amelia, who has risen

to speak.

She looks into the eyes of each in turn...

Yes?

There is gentle laughter.   Amelia reacts in mock surprise.

More laughter.   Applause from a wife, then the others, then

all.

She regards their amusement.   And losing none of the warmth

of her own smile...

G

INT. HANGAR - DAY

The LOCKHEED ELECTRA, a sleek state-of-the-art aircraft with

its gleaming metallic surface, nose up in the center of a

huge space. Its engines are on hoists, being worked on by a

team of MECHANICS.

Eight-year-old Gore gazes up, as if he has never seen

anything quite so wondrous. Amelia and Gene watch, with

barely suppressed smiles. He's in a suit. She's in grease-

stained overalls from working with the mechanics.

First one?

He glowers at her.    She glowers back.

No answer.       He waits without saying a word.

EXT. COAST GUARD STATION, LOS ANGELES - MORNING

A Coast Guard station overlooking the Pacific. A lone woman

leans on a railing. From the station, a MAN emerges, he

has...

...a thermos and two large mugs. He pours steaming coffee

into each, and brings them to the woman at the rail. She has

turned to study him as he approaches.

She holds out her hand. He juggles the mugs, so he can shake

it. Strong look in each other's eyes. Hands her a mug...

His slight grin.       A handsome guy.

Silence between them.       Comfortable smiles.

And, of course, this is exactly what she's doing.

She holds the look.

INT. BARCLAY HOTEL, NEW YORK - DAY

Amelia at a bank of microphones, smiling, modest,

comfortable. George and Fred stand back to one side.

FLASHBULBS go crazy, NEWSREEL cameras churn.

L         Threaten not to enlist?

George BOLTS forward to the microphones, looks at his wife

with astonishment...

The press ROARS with laughter.

Amelia walking alone toward the plane.

SUPERIMPOSE:   LUKE FIELD, HONOLULU.   MARCH 20, 1937.

welcomed by Fred's hand gently pulling her aboard. The door

CLOSES. We see Amelia and Fred in the cockpit. He checks a

gauge.

Ah.

Amelia ROARS OFF, gathering SPEED.

The Electra SUDDENLY VEERS TO THE RIGHT, and we SMASH CUT

TO...

INT. ELECTRA

Amelia THROTTLING DOWN the left engine.    The plane SWINGING

WILDLY to the left, as...

EXT./INT. ELECTRA

...the RIGHT WHEEL COLLAPSES, the plane SPINS TO THE LEFT and

we INTERCUT between the cockpit and the runway as the

Electra...

...CAREENS MADLY for a thousand feet, Amelia CUTTING THE

SWITCHES to the engines, fighting for control, PROPELLERS

SMASHED by the concrete runway, SPARKS FLYING IN EVERY

DIRECTION...

INTERCUT. Oakland Airport. George and his retinue waiting.

A phone RINGING. Someone takes the call, his face freezes,

.

he looks wildly around to...

SMASH CUT to the cockpit, the Electra SPINNING crazily on its

belly, SPARKS EVERYWHERE, the plane suddenly comes...

...to a BONE-JARRING STOP. The right MOTOR is pushed up INTO

its wing, which itself has BUCKLED, the stabilizer BENT, the

left wing extends UPWARD from scraping the runway, the

landing gear no longer exists.

SIRENS SCREAM as fire trucks and ambulances race toward them.

Amelia is ashen, disbelieving. Next to her, a gentle...

She doesn't even hear, THROWING open the cockpit, WAVING to

signal they're all right, we SMASH CUT TO...

EXT. OAKLAND AIRPORT - DAY

George wandering numbly on the airfield, as someone RUNS LIKE

CRAZY from the office, shouting...

George alone on the tarmac.   Stops in his tracks.   Now he can

cry.

EXT. GARDEN, LOS ANGELES HOME - ALMOST SUNRISE

Two figures in a garden, walking in light so spare they are

silhouettes. Her head is down. His hands are in his

pockets. We CLOSE on them as she fingers a blossom, we now

see she is miserable, fighting absolute despair.

He stops.   Realizing where he was going.   She never looks up.

She shakes her head.    No.

Tears stand in her eyes. She is so ashamed and remorseful.

He lets it stay silent as they walk. Then...

She looks over.    Not sure if...

A strong smile.    He nods.     We could.

Her eyes overwhelmed A his offer.

A held beat.

Hmmn?

He has no answer for that.       Takes her hand.   They head toward

the house.

INT. HANGAR - NIGHT

Massive enclosed space. The rebuilt Electra in pieces at

various work stations, being perfected by teams of mechanics.

T

A full beat.   The look holds between the men.

EXT. MIAMI AIRPORT - DAY - NEWSREEL FOOTAGE

Amelia and George crossing the tarmac from the Electra,

waving to the crowd.

Behind them, coat slung casually across his shoulder, is

Fred. Waving like he belongs.

CLOSE on the rugged smile.

EXT. BEACH, MIAMI - DUSK

The pastel sky has darkened along the row of legendary

hotels. At first, we can barely find them at the water's

edge. CLOSE to see her sitting where the surf can't quite

reach her toes. He's lying back, hands cradling his head.

Watching the stars come out. Nothing said. Then...

She looks down to his easy smile.

She smiles back.       Tenderness we don't always see.

A

She stares in his eyes.       Leans to him.

She brings her hands to his face. Her mouth to his.      Deep.

Longing. Her body sinks into him.

LONG ANGLE.      Two alone.   Only each other.

EXT. MIAMI AIRPORT - DAY

LONG ANGLE. From the open door of a hangar we see Amelia and

George facing reporters in front of the idling Electra. She

sits on the wing, he's just beneath her.

SUPERIMPOSE:      MIAMI AIRPORT.   JUNE 1.

There is no answer.    She leans up into a slow kiss.

Something in her serious face makes him smile.

Takes a step back toward the hangar door. One hand slightly

up, stay here. Then, the smile he's waited for.

He smiles back. She turns and heads out toward the idling

plane. She seems small, even fragile, alone on the tarmac.

STAY with George.    Watching her go.

EXT. AIRPORT, CALCUTTA - EVENING

Driving RAINSTORM as Amelia carries her gear toward the

Electra. Fred waits. The umbrellas aren't keeping them dry.

SUPERIMPOSE:   DUMDUM AIRDROME, CALCUTTA

The buildings have thatched roofs.    There are oxcarts by the

runway, abandoned to the downpour.    Fred has to shout over

the storm...

He just glares at her.   Rain POUNDING all around them.

He doesn't move.

And she climbs into the plane.   He just stands in the rain

and glowers.

EXT. AIRSTRIP - MOMENTS LATER

The Electra ROARING down the runway. It's all alone, no one

else crazy enough to be out there. At last the plane...

...LIFTS INTO the rain.    Wobbles just a beat.    And begins to

CLIMB.

EXT. ELECTRA - LATER

A wrenching battle, plane versus monsoon. The storm is

heavier, deafening, actually STRIPPING PAINT from the

Electra's wings.

INT. ELECTRA - SAME MOMENT

Amelia beyond exhaustion, but focused, fighting it.      We think

she's flying alone. Until...

...Fred drops into the seat beside her. No words as he

watches her struggle. Our plane is all over the sky. The

DIN is ungodly.

An AIR POCKET DROPS them 200 feet.

She glances over.    For once, she's scared.

Beat.

Held look.

She starts to TURN the plane around.

INT. ELECTRA - DAY

Amelia flying down through heavy turbulence, though it is no

longer raining. Her features tense. We see the accumulated

strain of the adventure.

F

her. He's worried. Points, and we see...

...CALCUTTA below, sprawling and endless. Between us and the

ground, a huge gathering of FLYING SHAPES.

Her tired features form a smile.

He takes her point.    She turns back to work...

And with cold-blooded nerve, she SWOOPS down, down, THROUGH

the flock of eagles, scattering them as we arc in for a

perfect landing. She never turns to...

...Fred, who is still white-knuckling, trying to get his

heart started. He can't believe what she's just done.

Rolling, rolling...

Establishing shot of a graceful pillar of the Raj.   Night

falling.

EXT. COURTYARD, GOVERNOR'S HOUSE - SAME MOMENT

A fountain in an ornate courtyard. There is a RECEPTION, as

every evening for Amelia, attended by local DIGNITARIES.

Fred, already a little drunk, leads Amelia to a massive teak-

wood table. He breaks off the corner of a cracker, sets it

down in the center of the table.

He strikes a match. SNUFFS the flame. Puts the burned-out

match head just by the scrap of cracker.

Points way across the marble courtyard.

She glances up.   He beckons respectfully.

She lifts a telephone...

INTERCUT:   INT. GEORGE'S OFFICE - DAY

CLOSE on a WALL MAP. We realize that George has been fol-

lowing her odyssey on a map of his own. We PULL BACK to

reveal...

He looks elegant in crisp suit and tie.

INTERCUT: Amelia's eyes WIDE. She seems truly thrilled.

INTERCUT BETWEEN THEM now throughout...
