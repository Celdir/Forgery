FADE IN:

SCENE 1 OMITTED

EXT. SAN FERNANDO VALLEY - NIGHT

OPEN on a MOVING WIDE SHOT of a mountain range with the

distant lights of the San Fernando Valley behind it.

BEGIN CREDITS as a NAVY JET drops down into the picture.

PUSH IN on the jet's exhaust flame. Have the words "THE

BLAST" come out of the flame. Then there is a SLIGHT

EXPLOSION and the flame intensifies. The words "FROM THE

PAST" jump out of the exhaust as the jet momentarily

shakes.

INT. JET

The PILOT feels the jet shake. But he looks at his

indicators and everything appears to be normal. He

relaxes.

EXT. JET

We begin with a WIDER REAR SHOT of the jet and allow the

plane to move away. Then SUPER: "LOS ANGELES, 1962"

before continuing the main titles. A popular recording

from that period has been playing throughout.

EXT. CALVIN'S WORK SHOP - NIGHT

Start on a CU of the HAM RADIO ANTENNA, WIND GAUGE and

THERMOMETER attached to the roof of Calvin's shop. (We

can hear military air traffic chatter on Calvin's

Hallicrafter radio.) Then move down to the window where

we see CALVIN Webber tinkering with a gadget at his work

bench. Calvin's very pregnant wife HELEN appears. The

music becomes source.

They exit the workshop for the house.  Calvin has left

the ham radio on.

INT. COCKPIT OF JET - SAME TIME

The YOUNG PILOT looks down at the flashing red light on

his control panel. He speaks into the oxygen mask that

hangs loosely from his helmet.

INT. DINING ROOM

DAVE, BETTY, BOB, and RUTH (30's) pass around the buffet

table. Another period song is playing on the phonograph.

Helen has entered from the kitchen with more food. She

favors June Allison.

INT. LIVING ROOM

Calvin is using a cocktail shaker to very carefully make

Rob Roys for the crowd at the bar. It's like watching a

chemist at work. Calvin's a pipe-smoker.

Polite laughter follows, but the guy out of Calvin's

sight-line rolls his eyes.

ANGLE - DAVE AND BOB

with drinks. Helen is in the b.g., rushing around, over-

serving everyone.

ANGLE - CALVIN

as his guests sample their Rob Roys.

Calvin gives the man his patented thumbs-up sign.

ANGLE - BETTY AND RUTH

over by the patio doors. We can see Calvin's shop through

the window.

The women look at Calvin.

ANGLE - CALVIN

with guests (one is called Harold) at the bar.

Poor Harold.

INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME

Most of the guests are women, gabbing and helping Helen

out as she removes a pot roast from the oven and busily

jumps around the kitchen.

EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT, MOMENTS LATER

A late guest named RON hurries up the walkway and into

the house.

SCENE 8 OMITTED

INT. LIVING ROOM - A SECOND LATER

Calvin is with another guest.

Ron pushes his way through the crowd.

Calvin immediately heads for the family room. Others

follow.

INT. FAMILY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Everyone is huddled around the JFK TV press conference.

There seems to be a lot of smokers. Helen appears

shortly, wearing a hot pad mitten on each hand.

Calvin cuts a knowing look at Helen who dutifully returns

it.

EXT. JET - NIGHT

The plane swoops over the Valley and we see the

spectacular lights of L.A. sprawl.  There is a TRAIL OF

SPARKS coming from the jet's engine.

INT. JET COCKPIT

The plane is shaking terribly and the pilot is having a

very hard time controlling it.

EXT. JET

The trembling plane circles to the west.

INT. FAMILY ROOM

Return to TV.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT/ EXT. HOUSE, MOMENTS LATER

To Helen's embarrassment, Calvin is ushering  all the

guests to the front door. Helen is passing out hats and

purses. She and Calvin speak simultaneously - somewhere

in the middle we cut outside.

Helen can barely get a "good night" out before Calvin

shuts the door.

ANGLE - DAVE AND BOB

Following their wives out.

Bob whistles softly. Calvin's a nut all right.

INT. FRONT DOOR

Calvin turns to Helen, a grave expression on his face.

He points down.

He leads her out of shot.

EXT. BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER

Calvin and Helen leave the house; cross the patio; and

hurry to the shop. Back in the house, the record player

has been left on:  "How Much Is That Doggie In The

Window...?"  Helen is carrying the pot roast which is

wrapped in foil.

He does.

The SOUND OF THE TRAINER JET makes a low pass over

Calvin's house.  Calvin sticks his head out the door and

looks up.

INT. WORKSHOP

They enter. The place is full of tools and gadgets--

mostly construction equipment. The ham radio is still on.

Calvin and Helen speak over the Tower who is telling

other aircraft in the vicinity to clear the area.

Calvin unplugs the radio and quickly wraps the cord.

He pushes aside a table that is hiding a hatch in the

floor and unlocks it by turning the hatch's wheel.  Then

he opens the hatch and reaches inside to turn on a light.

Red submarine light shines up from below.  All the while

he and Helen are chatting:

She steps into the hatch and onto a ladder.

INT. JET - NIGHT

The young pilot is bouncing around the now smokey

cockpit.

The pilot rights the plane; points the joy stick; and

reaches for the ejection handles between his legs.

EXT. JET

The pilot ejects.

INT. EMPTY COCKPIT

This is the pilot's POV (were there a pilot.)  We see the

coastline and we notice that the plane is making a... U-

turn, away from the water and back towards the Valley.

EXT. JET

Streaking back to the Valley with a dramatic tail of

sparks.

EXT. THE PARACHUTING PILOT

He notices that his plane is headed directly at him.  It

misses him by a matter of yards.

INT. LADDER - CONTINUOUS

Taking the liberty of a CUTAWAY SECTION, we follow them

down the ladder which is inside a corrugated metal tube.

On either side of the tube we see layers of dirt.

EXT. JET - SAME TIME

It COMPLETES ITS TURN and STREAKS SKYWARD at a 90 degree

angle to the ground... until it SPUTTERS and the ENGINES

STOP.  Then, after a Road Runner-like beat or two, it

begins to FALL DIRECTLY BACK TO EARTH, tail first.

INT. SMALL ANTEROOM - SAME TIME

The Webbers step off a metal ladder and face a vault-like

chrome hatchway.  Calvin opens the six-inch thick door by

pushing another switch on his small box. Helen takes the

roast.

EXT. JET - NIGHT

With only the sound of wind, the jet continues to fall as

the lights of the Valley rush up to meet it.

INT. SHELTER - CONTINUOUS

They step into a darkened room.

Calvin flicks a wall switch and we HEAR A SERIES OF

LIGHTS COMING ON.  The echoes of the sounds suggest a

large, cavernous space.  All we can see is the cinder

block wall behind them and the hatch door, which Calvin

begins to shut by putting his body into it.

Just then there is a TREMENDOUS DOUBLE EXPLOSION FROM

ABOVE which knocks them to the floor. (Note: Helen hangs

on to the roast, trying her best not to drop it.) The

LADDER, CORRUGATED TUBE, ROOF, AND LOTS OR DIRT AND ROCK

BEGIN TO CRASH DOWN INTO THE ANTEROOM. Calvin struggles

to his feet and gets the vault door shut just in the nick

of time.

Hanging on to the roast she nods vigorously, trying to be

brave.

Calvin hurries to a bright RED METAL BOX on the wall.

Next to the box is a LARGE THERMOMETER OR GAUGE that's

labeled "Radiation Count."  There are OTHER GAUGES that

are dropping to zero.

INTER CUT - CU OF BOX AND THERMOMETER

The box has a dial on it, next to which is a large lever.

A foreboding sign reads  HATCHWAY TIME LOCKS, USE EXTREME

CAUTION.  Calvin pulls the lever.

BACK TO SCENE

The chrome and steel EXIT HATCHWAY AUTOMATICALLY LOCKS

with great noise, precision and...finality. There is the

SOUND OF A REAR DOOR doing the same thing.

She continues to stare at him.

She continues to stare at him.

Helen bursts into tears.

EXT WEBBER PATIO - DAY

Two police detectives, LEVY and ATKINSON, exit the house.

Uniformed workers carefully carry small pieces of the jet

from the crash site. The detectives lead us to what's

left of Calvin's shop. It's mostly a charred crater.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - SAME TIME (12 HOURS AFTER BLAST)

Helen awakes alone and still dressed. She sits up and

trys the phone on the night table. It is dead. She hangs

up and exits.

INT. KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM/PATIO

Calvin is making sandwiches from the pot roast. Two empty

Doctor Pepper bottles sit next to the stove where Calvin

is heating the soda. He sees Helen enter the livingroom.

He enters with her sandwich and a cup of Dr. Pepper.

She walks out onto the patio. She rubs her arms as if

cold.

He follows her out to the patio.

A reverse angle shows for the first time the rest of the

fallout shelter -- which looks very different from

"home". Perhaps she starts to cry again.

SCENE 29B OMITTED

SCENE 29C OMITTED

SCENE 29D OMITTED

SCENE 29E OMITTED

INT. VERY WIDE OF THE SHELTER - HOURS LATER

We can only hear Adam's entrance into the world. There is

Helen's pain, followed by Adam's cry, followed by

Calvin's rejoicing.

INT. SHELTER - DAYS LATER

SUPER: SEVERAL DAYS LATER

Start on the record player in the living room. The

country and western classic "Hey, Good Looking" is

spinning.

OMIT SCENE 30

INT. SHELTER, BATTERY ROOM - SAME TIME

Calvin walks through checking things over; pleased by

what he sees.  He exits. ("Hey Good Looking" continues.)

INT. SHELTER, FISH FARM - CONTINUOUS

Calvin checks the switch he uses to control the lights.

Then he checks out all the tiny fish swimming in the six

feet by six feet tank.  When he hears a baby's cry he

hurries away.(Music continues)

INT. SHELTER, MASTER BEDROOM

Calvin enters and smiles with great affection at his

family:  Helen and a NEWBORN SON cradled next to her in

bed.

Calvin shrugs.

She points upwards.

They both look up. Then he tells her.

Calvin happily gives her his patented thumbs-up sign.

A MONTAGE:  1) CALVIN , IN A LARGE SUPPLY ROOM, PICKS OUT

THE PLYWOOD HE'LL NEED FOR THE CEILINGS. ( 60'S HAPPY,

BUSY SCORE COVERS ALL THIS.)

2) HELEN, CARRIES LITTLE ADAM (THREE DAYS OLD) ONTO THE

FAKE PATIO (WITH THE PLASTIC PLANTS AND THE PLASTIC

GRASS). SHE LOOKS UP AT CALVIN WHO'S ON A LADDER

INSTALLING A CEILING.

SUPER: SEVERAL WEEKS LATER

3) IN THE FAMILY ROOM, CALVIN SHOWS HELEN HOW HE'S RIGGED

A PROJECTOR TO THROW A PICTURE ONTO THE TV SCREEN. SHE'S

THRILLED TO SEE "THE HONEYMOONERS!" MAIN TITLES COME ON.

ADAM, LYING ON A QUILT BY HELEN'S CHAIR, IS ABOUT FOUR

WEEKS OLD. (IT'S IMPORTANT HERE THAT WE SEE A 8MM FILM

BOX WITH THE "I LOVE LUCY" LOGO ON IT)

SUPER: SEVERAL MONTHS LATER

4) TOTAL DARKNESS. THEN CALVIN FLICKS A SWITCH AND A BANK

OF OVERHEAD LIGHTS COMES ON TO SIMULATE SUNLIGHT. UNDER

THE LIGHTS ARE SOIL BEDS ON WOODEN TABLES. CALVIN IS

EXCITED TO SHOW HELEN THE TINY, YOUNG CARROTS COMING UP.

HELEN HOLDS ADAM AT THREE MONTHS OLD.

SUPER: A YEAR LATER

5) IN THE DINING ROOM, HELEN IS SERVING POT ROAST AND

SOME VERY NICE LOOKING CARROTS. ADAM IS SIX MONTHS OLD.

HE WATCHES HIS PARENTS AS THEY SAY GRACE.

6) HELEN "SHOPS" FOR SUPPLIES IN THE LARGE STOREROOM.

ADAM, ONE YEAR OLD, RIDES IN THE SHOPPING CART.(1963)

7) CALVIN NETS A WIGGLING, FULLY GROWN FISH.

8) THE FAMILY WATCHES "THE HONEYMOONERS" TOGETHER. (ADAM

IS STILL ONE YEAR OLD.)

CALVIN ENJOYS HIS PIPE IN THE LIVINGROOM

9) CALVIN EXAMINES THE REAR HATCHWAY AS HELEN APPROACHES

WITH ADAM IN HER ARMS.

A sober beat, then:

Helen nods vigorously.

She sets Adam (one year old) down on his wobbly little

legs, steadying him at the shoulders.

And Adam takes his first step. And then another! And

another! It's a joyous event.

CAMERA LEAVES THEM AND TRAVELS UPWARD THROUGH THE CEILING

AND THEN, AGAIN USING THE DEVICE OF A CUTAWAY, IT

CONTINUES THROUGH DIRT AND SEDIMENT ALL THE WAY UP TO THE

SURFACE-- WHERE THE BACKYARD AVOCADO TREES ARE BEING

BULLDOZED AND THE BACK FENCE HAS ALREADY BEEN TORN DOWN.

THE WEBBER HOUSE FACED A QUIET RESIDENTIAL STREET, BUT IT

BACKED ONTO VICTORY AVENUE (OR ONE OF THOSE VALLEY

AVENUES) AND IN THE LATE FIFTIES AND EARLY SIXTIES THOSE

MAIN THOROUGHFARES WENT COMMERCIAL.

A SIGN tells us that this is the future site of MOM'S

MALT SHOP."

Some WORKMEN with shovels have discovered the REAR

SHELTER DOORS where they have been digging.

The construction BOSS comes over for a look.

EXT. WEBBER HOUSE, PATIO (THE REAL ONE) - DAY, SAME TIME

A Realtor steps out with A COUPLE looking to buy the

house.

She points out to a LEVEL LAWN where the shop used to be.

We can see the Malt Shop construction crew beyond that.

EXT. BACK AT THE MALT SHOP CONSTRUCTION SIGHT -

CONTINUOUS, DAY

The guy driving the heavy front loader lets the bucket

slam to the ground hard.

INT. BACK AT THE SHELTER REAR DOOR - CONTINUOUS

Calvin vaguely hears the noise made by the front loader.

INT. SHELTER, LIVING ROOM - EVENING (1965-66)

SUPER: 1965

Calvin smokes his pipe and enjoys a Manhattan cocktail as

Adam (three and a half) sits in his lap reading the title

page from Alice in Wonderland.

Calvin smiles pridefully over at Helen who works

intensely on the couch making a coffee-can Santa from

instructions in the The Redbook Crafts Collection.

Helen ponders that statement.

Calvin smiles and messes up Adam's hair.

They both look nervously up at the ceiling.

EXT. MOM'S MALT SHOP (NOW FINISHED) - DAY (1965-66)

CARS PASS BY on the busy avenue.

INT. MOM'S MALT SHOP - CONTINUOUS

CLEAN CUT SURFER KIDS are being served their favorite ice-

cream and malt treats by MOM herself and a young SODA

JERK. Appropriate music comes from the jukebox.

Two YOUNG MEN IN BEATLE HAIRCUTS enter. Everyone looks at

them in amazement. (Perhaps there is also a record change

here.)

INT. SHELTER, CLASSROOM - DAY (65-66)

Calvin is building and furnishing a classroom from

materials available to him. He has had the forethought to

bring down the books needed for his child's education.

Little Adam is watching him.

INT. FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

The family watches the same "Honeymooner" clip they

watched before. Calvin still finds it funny. Helen

wonders about that.

INT. BEDROOM - LATER

Helen is pouring cooking sherry into an empty Listerine

bottle.

EXT. MALT SHOP - DAY (1970-71)

SUPER: 1970

Other buildings have been constructed around the malt

shop. Foot and car traffic are heavier.

INT. MALT SHOP - SAME TIME

The clean-cut kids have been replaced by FLOWER CHILDREN.

Mom hasn't put a lot back into the decor, but she has

made concessions to the fashions of the time. The jukebox

plays something appropriate. Mom and the Jerk are five

years older.

Mom gives the Jerk a suspicious look.

INT. SHELTER - DAY (1970-71)

Calvin (40) is giving Adam (8) a boxing lesson. They work

from a "How To" book and use gloves made from living room

pillows. Adam's pretty good. Helen appears and watches

with pride. Then she interupts.

He goes to her.

INT. SHELTER - MINUTES LATER

The hydroponic garden area is empty. A Perry Como song

begins and Adam and Helen enter waltzing. Adam has

changed shirts and combed his hair. Somewhere, Calvin is

watching with pride. After a while Calvin cuts in. He and

Helen dance beautifully. Then they kiss. Somewhere, Adam

is watching with pride.

INT. MALT SHOP - DAY (1975-76)

SUPER: 1975

The place continues its decline. Acid rock plays loudly.

Mom and the Jerk serve the smallish crowd.

The acid rock song ends and an early, bad disco hit comes

on the jukebox.

The Jerk puts his hands to his ears, he so hates the new

music.

INT. SHELTER, CLASSROOM  (1975-76)

The room looks like Ricky Nelson's class.  There are twin

pictures of Ike and JFK on the wall.  Adam is eleven.

Adam follows his dad out.

INT. SHUFFLEBOARD COURT - CONTINUOUS

They pass Helen who is absentmindedly poking at the puck

with a stick. She's not having a very good day. She wears

her hair dryer but it's not plugged in.

INT. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Calvin hands Adam a cigar box. Adam opens it to see

Calvin's remarkable baseball card collection.

They do.

INT. SHELTER - NIGHT

Start close on flashing roller skates. Then cut wider to

show Adam roller skating. He passes Helen who has fallen

asleep knitting in one of the lawn chairs. Then Adam

passes Calvin who is on a ladder soldering a leaking

ceiling pipe.

EXT. MALT SHOP - DAY (1991)

SUPER: 1991

TWO PUNKS with spiked green hair enter to the strains of

"My Sharona."

INT. MALT SHOP - DAY (1991)

Mom watches the punks enter. Then crosses to the Soda

Jerk who now has a tattoo on his forehead.

She walks off.

INT. KITCHEN  (1995)

SUPER: 1995

Helen has prepared a birthday cake. Having no birthday

candles, she's used three votive candles. We can hear

Calvin and Adam talking in the dining room. (She and

Calvin are now in their 60's.)

Calvin enters.

Calvin leaves while Helen lights the candles. The whole

shelter goes dark. Calvin returns with two presents

wrapped in whatever is available.

INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Helen and Calvin enter singing Happy Birthday. We see the

ADULT ADAM for the first time in silhouette. His handsome

face is revealed to us when the cake is placed before

him.

He does both. His parents clap. Helen takes one of the

presents from Calvin and gives it to Adam. He unwraps it.

It's a green coat.

He gives Adam the second present. Adam tears off the

paper to find a pair of roller-skates that Calvin has

redesigned. The new skates look kind of like

rollerblades.

His parents don't have a reply for that.

His parents stare at him for a beat, then:

They do.

Helen rises and exits.

INT. BATTERY ROOM- LATER, SAME NIGHT

Helen enters and goes into the generator room. Through

the glass we can see (and hear) her scream. Straightening

her hair and feeling much better, she exits as Calvin

strolls by wearing his tool belt. She's headed out.

She turns to him. He gives her his patented thumbs up

sign.

She smiles wanely and leaves. He shuts the generator door

she left open.

SCENE 60 OMITTED

SCENE 61 OMITTED

INT.SHELTER, LIVING ROOM - VERY EARLY MORNING

SUPER: THE PRESENT

The room is quiet and empty.  The star-burst WALL CLOCK

on the paneling says 6:15.

INT. SHELTER, KITCHEN - SAME TIME

Also empty.

INT. STOREROOM - SAME TIME

Also empty.  And with MEAGER SUPPLIES on the shelves.

INT. POWER AND PUMP ROOM - SAME TIME

The old pipes are rusted and patched. Some are leaking

badly.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - SAME TIME

Calvin wakes up. He looks over at Helen's bed.

ANGLE - HELEN

She wakes up. Then jumps out of bed.

SCENE 67 OMITTED

CLOSE ON THE RED METAL BOX

that has been ticking on the wall for thirty-five years.

Suddenly it STOPS TICKING and a rather annoying ALARM

GOES OFF.  Calvin's hand reaches up and turns it off by

throwing the lever up.

ANOTHER ANGLE shows us the mechanism on the FRONT

HATCHWAY switch to OPEN with a loud, vault-like move.

ANOTHER ANGLE

reveals the family in their pajamas standing in front of

the front hatchway and red box.

Calvin grabs a handle and using all his strength, opens

the front entrance hatch. And then must jump back when

nothing but earth and rock pour into the room.

His parents take a beat then race off like maniacs

through the entire shelter to the back hatch door.  They

knock over whatever gets in their way as they go. Adam

follows.

INT. BACK HATCHWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Calvin and Helen arrive followed by Adam who can't

possibly share his parent's deep concerns. Everyone is

out of breath.

Calvin attempts to open the big hatch, but can't.  Adam

helps him.  Helen pitches in.  Slowly, with lots of

squeaking, the DOOR OPENS. He steps through the hatch and

flips a wall switch.  Red submarine LIGHTS COME ON....

And the service elevator is intact.

INT. ANTEROOM - CONTINUOUS

Helen steps through and embraces Calvin joyfully.  The

old folks break into a dance as Adam enters.

Helen's eyes widen and her hand flies up to her mouth.

She is just as shocked as Calvin.

There is a pause, then:

SCENE 71 OMITTED

EXT. THE MALT SHOP - NIGHT

Cars flash by in a rare L.A. DOWNPOUR.  All that's left

of Mom's is an EMPTY BUILDING with a painted-out front

window and a "For Sale or Rent" sign.  There's ANOTHER

SHOP attached to it CAMERA RIGHT but we can't see what it

is.  The alley way on the left has always been there.

INT. MALT SHOP - CONTINUOUS

TWO DRUNK BUMS are sharing a bottle. One of them is the

Soda Jerk, now a  dissipated middle-aged man (with a

tattoo on his forehead.)

The cement FLOOR of the old Malt Shop begins to QUIVER

AND RUMBLE.

The Other Bum staggers to his feet and SPLITS for a back

window.  Soda Jerk is fearless.  Until finally the

HYDRAULIC DOORS of the back entrance SPLIT THE FLOOR with

an eerie, struggling whine and LARGE CHUNKS OF CEMENT GO

FLYING.  Then up comes RED SUBMARINE LIGHT followed by

Calvin in his BIG YELLOW SUIT with Geiger counter

ticking.

Calvin raises his hand and yells through his mask.

The Soda Jerk FAINTS. Calvin, sounding like a deep sea

diver and having to walk like Frankenstein, goes over to

the Soda Jerk and studies his face in the light of his

flashlight.  He is horrified by what he sees.

Calvin looks around the room and heads for the back.  He

moves his Geiger counter around and gets a quiet (safe)

reading. Then he removes a KITCHEN MATCH from a plastic

container and strikes it against the wall.  The MATCH

BURNS, so Calvin takes off his hood and visor and

breathes the air.  It stinks in there.

EXT. MALT SHOP - MOMENTS LATER, RAINING

Calvin (out of the head gear and top of the suit) slowly

pushes the door open and steps out. He's surprised to

find an empty BODY SHOP behind the Malt Shop, where the

avocado trees should be.

He points his flashlight around and heads for the ALLEY

to his left.

EXT. ALLEY - A MOMENT LATER, RAINING

DERELICT CARS left over from the Body Shop sit against a

fence. Calvin marvels at the cars, even in their present

condition.  In a TIGHTER SHOT he studies the chrome-

plated word "Toyota."   A HOMELESS MAN arrives to search

through the garbage. Calvin hurries back towards the

avenue.

SCENE 76 OMITTED

EXT. MALT SHOP - TEN MINUTES LATER, RAIN

Calvin emerges from the alley that separates the Malt

Shop from another storefront (perhaps now a rundown Thai

restaurant.)

CLOSER ON HIM

watching the cars fly by on the wet avenue.  Suddenly, a

cross-dressing STREET WALKER steps up to him with a

cigarette.

Fumbling, he finally gets her little cigar lighted with

one of his kitchen matches.

He breaks into a trot, heading up the street past a seedy

BAR (used to be the convenience store) just as a

hopelessly DRUNK HAG of a woman is shoved out and told to

stay out.  Calvin watches as the woman stumbles to the

curb where she TOSSES her cookies.  TWO LOW RIDERS HOP BY

full of TAUNTING YOUNG HISPANIC GANG MEMBERS, one of whom

BRANDISHES A PISTOL and, just for fun, points it at

Calvin.  When Calvin sees the pistol he ducks into the

ADULT BOOKSTORE. The young gang member pulls the trigger

and we (not Calvin) see that the realistic-looking pistol

is really a water gun.

INT. ADULT BOOK AND VIDEO STORE

Calvin races in and, gathering himself, addresses the

PAKISTANI MAN behind the counter.

The clerk just watches him.

Then Calvin turns and has his first look at the

material...and he GRABS HIS HEART and SCREAMS and FALLS

back KNOCKING OVER a whole ROW OF VIDEOS AND MAGAZINES.

INT. SHELTER, KITCHEN - AN HOUR LATER

Calvin sits at the breakfast table, still breathing hard

and holding his chest.  His family looks on with great

concern.  The anti-radiation suit and gear is piled in

the corner.

ADAM covers his ears and hums.

Helen copes by moving around the kitchen doing things

that don't need to be done.

She slumps, then resumes her needless activity.  Calvin

takes Adam's arm and the son drops his hands and stops

humming.

She hurries into the living room.

INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Helen let's out a silent scream, then hurries back into

the kitchen.

INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Breathing heavily, Calvin suddenly clutches at his chest

in great pain and collapses.

INT. HALLWAY - HOURS LATER

Adam paces.  Then Helen comes out.  Behind her, we can

see Calvin sleeping in his bed. She heads for the living

room. He follows.

They go through the living room and cross to the patio.

Helen hands him a pencil and pad. Adam follows her to the

fish farm.

He does.

At the fish tank, Helen pulls up a slim chain that is

attached to a water-tight aluminum box which she quickly

opens. The box contains $6,000 in wrapped one hundred

dollar bills. Helen takes half of it.

She heads back for the house. He follows.

They have stopped by the garden.

They hug.

INT. ADAM'S ROOM - AN HOUR LATER

He is packing. He looks at his cigar box and opens it. He

studies the contents: The Cards, stock certificates, and

an old photo of his parents. He decides to pack the box.

Helen enters with a long shopping list.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Adam sets down his suitcase and goes to his father's bed.

He sits. At the door, Helen dries her eyes with her

apron.  Calvin indicates that he wants to whisper to

Adam, who drops his ear close to his father's lips.

Calvin nods. Adam rises and starts for the door. But

Calvin remembers something and beckons him back to speak

weakly into his son's ear.

And then Calvin closes his eyes and sleeps.

INT. MALT SHOP - SAME DAY

The Soda Jerk has turned the rear exit into a religious

shrine.  He's put flowers and candles and costume jewelry

and religious icons (from all the Majors) on top of and

around the broken cement.  Currently he's on his knees,

rocking back and forth as he prays.

And,lo! There came a rumbling even as from the very

bowels of the earth and a great light showed forth

followed by gates of armor which opened and shut and

delivered up the vision of a young man whose countenance

caused the Soda Jerk to be struck dumb and to fall on his

face and to weep in fear.  And, Adam, taking pity on the

man, put down his suitcase, and went to him, saying:

Adam turns and leaves. The Soda Jerk falls to his knees

and shakes all over.

EXT. MALT SHOP - CONTINUOUS

Adam steps out onto the sidewalk and sunlight falls on

him much brighter than anything he has ever seen.  He

looks at it on the arm of his coat and then, slowly, he

looks up at the sky.

INTERCUT - LOVELY CLOUDS AND BLUE SKY

And now it is Adam who is dumbstruck. BYSTANDER #1

appears and sees Adam looking up.

Adam becomes momentarily interested in a parking meter.

A MOTHER and her CHILD approach from the other direction.

Several more people are drawn over. A CONVERTIBLE goes by

in the foreground with passengers who are looking up.

Adam continues down the sidewalk,looking up. A BLACK

WOMAN POSTAL WORKER passes by.

The Pakistani exits the Adult Bookstore.

When Adam looks down to answer the man he sees the "Adult

Bookstore" sign.

And everyone does run away, including Adam. The avenue is

left totally deserted.

INT. KITCHEN NOOK - SAME DAY

Helen sits sipping tea, deep in thoughts of concern for

Adam. Behind her Calvin appears in the open window.

Helen is so startled she knocks the tea all over the

place.

Calvin leaves, then comes back.

SCENE 85A OMITTED

EXT. CORNER BUS STOP - AFTERNOON, SAME DAY

An L.A. bus comes directly at CAMERA.

ANGLE - THE DRIVER

INT. BUS - A MOMENT LATER

Start on a MOVING STEADY CAM SHOT on Adam's POV of bus

passengers as he heads for a seat. The passengers look at

him in amazement and some fear.

ANGLE - ADAM

going to his seat; smiling at the passengers. (He is

carrying a $100 bill.)

Adam finds a seat next to a heavily perspiring young

PSYCHO HEROIN ADDICT.

ANOTHER ANGLE OF THEM

Adam shows the Psycho the $100 bill.

The bus pulls out. It gets up to about twenty miles an

hour.

INTERCUT: PASSENGERS

looking back at Adam with concern.

The increasingly nervous Psycho looks around, then nods

that he does.

The psycho shakes his head.

INTERCUT - DRIVER IN THE REAR VIEW

He's not going to stop until he wants to stop.

ANGLE - OLD JEWISH COUPLE PASSENGERS.

who are anxious for Adam to leave.

Adam leans in close to the OLD MAN.

The man and his wife take that the wrong way and start to

scream.

ANGLE - THE DRIVER'S FOOT

hitting the brakes.

EXT.- BUS

stopping suddenly. Through the windows we see Adam go

down.

INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS

The back door opens as Adam gets up.

Adam exits the bus. Everyone, including the Psycho,

heaves a huge sign of relief.

INT. SUPER MARKET - MINUTES LATER

Adam enters and (after getting over the automatic doors

and the check-out technology) is overwhelmed by the

magnificence of the postmodern California supermarket.

The check-out counters alone are amazing. Seeing others

do it, he takes a cart, placing his suitcase in it.

INT. BAKERY COUNTER

Adam passes the baked goods, paying particular attention

to the elaborate birthday cakes.

Adam leaves. The clerk turns to a fellow worker.

INT. AISLE

Adam marvels at the abundance and variety. He passes a

mother whose child is riding in the cart and that reminds

him of his own mom -- when she used to let him ride that

way.  Then he is surprised to see a MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE so

casually dressed in public. She (overweight) is in an

unfortunate terrycloth halter-shorts combination.  He

(hirsute) is in a sleeveless undershirt and baggy bathing

trunks.

INT. FRESH PRODUCE

Adam picks up one of those huge California cucumbers that

always amaze Easterners.  He shows it to the JAPANESE-

AMERICAN CLERK.

INT. MEAT COUNTER

Adam is looking at the live lobsters as a BUTCHER steps

up.

Adam chuckles because he thinks the man is kidding.

Adam hurries away.

SCENE 93 OMITTED

SCENE 94 OMITTED

A MONTAGE

of Adam on another bus. He looks frantically out the

window. We see his POV of shops and stores and people. At

one point he sees two women joggers which he wonders

about. Then he sees two men arguing violently. Gradually

late day turns to night and Adam becomes more and more

depressed. Then he sees something. He is elated. He jumps

up and tells the driver:

EXT. - VENTURA BLVD - NIGHT

The bus stops mid-block and Adam gets off. He crosses the

street causing only one car to hit the brakes. On the

other side of the avenue we see what has gotten his

attention. It's an ADULT BOOKSTORE much like the last one

we saw (probably owned by the same chain.) He's happy but

when he looks next door he sees he's in a different

place. Sad and lost he turns north and starts to walk

until -- a billboard catches his attention. We pan up to

see a billboard for liposuction that features an almost

NUDE WOMAN. Adam is struck by the image and we spend some

time cutting between him and it. Then gathering himself

he turns and begins to walk south.

ANOTHER ANGLE

of him as he passes a BODY PIERCING STORE and wonders

about that. Then he sees something that blows his mind.

WIDER ANGLE

of a STRAY DOG passing by. Adam reacts.

ANGLE - CU OF BASEBALL CARDS STORE WINDOW

A sign says: COMIC BOOKS & BASEBALL CARDS BOUGHT, SOLD &

TRADED.

INT. CARD AND COMIC STORE - MOMENTS LATER

Adam enters with his suitcase in one hand and his cigar

box in the other.  He steps up to the counter where the

owner (JERRY) sits reading the newspaper. He has a

fondness for Navajo jewelry.

A YOUNG WOMAN enters from the back of the store and goes

to another counter.  Neither man notices.

He flips open the cigar box to reveal to Jerry riches

beyond his wildest dreams.  Jerry actually moans and then

must pretend the moan was a cough.

He reaches in and looks through the cards.

A woman steps into the shot. She has come from the back

of the store and her back is momentarily to us.

Adam turns to her and is immediately awe struck. We

reveal EVE RUSTOKOV. She tosses her lipstick into her

purse. Eve works in the card shop and is on her way out.

She closes his cigar box and gives it to him.

She walks back to the counter to get her coat.

Jerry is surprised when Adam suddenly takes his arm

firmly.

Eve sees a fist fight coming. She takes Adam by the arm.

They head for the door and exit.

Adam re-enters.

Adam walks towards the man smiling.

Jerry takes a nervous step backwards, but Eve steps back

in and pulls Adam out.

Adam exits. Jerry doesn't know what to say.

EXT. CARD STORE - NIGHT

They exit the store.

A mental picture of that causes Adam to slump against a

store window and drop his box of cards.

Together they pick up the cards.

They rise.

She races around the corner.  He goes after her.

She runs into a parking lot.  He follows.

Adam takes a Hornsby card from his coat pocket and shows

it to her.

She arrives at her car (dirty GEO) and anxiously unlocks

the driver's door.

She gets in. He gets in the back seat behind her.

He runs around to the front while Eve chats with herself.

SCENE 99 OMITTED

EXT. HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY - MINUTES LATER

Traffic is moving at fifteen miles an hour. The dash

lights fascinate him but the car scares him.  She notices

that he is gripping the seat belt for dear life.

She switches over to AM and runs by a Perry Como record,

"Round and Round", looking for traffic.

She gets Perry.

EXT. FREEWAY

Eve's car splits for the exit ramp.

INT. EVE'S CAR

The sudden speed scares Adam.

EXT. OFF RAMP

She comes off, catches the light and whips onto the

surface street, tires squealing.

INT. CAR

Adam is hanging onto his seat belt. Eve puts the pedal to

the metal.

She turns Perry way up.

EXT. AVENUE

Eve does a dandy job of trading lanes and passing.  The

little Geo's engine screams. Adam's sort of getting into

it.

EXT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN - TEN MINUTES LATER

The Geo flies up to a quick stop.

INT. CAR

Eve turns to Adam, who has had A Life Experience.

He hands over the card like someone in a post-sex stupor.

He gets out with the suitcase, and after shutting the

door leans down to speak to her.

She tears off, leaving him there.

INT. HOTEL REGISTRATION - MINUTES LATER

Adam addresses the clerk.

Adam gives him a baseball card.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER SAME NIGHT

A BELLBOY ushers Adam in and sets down his bag.

Adam picks up the phone and listens.

He offers two dollars.

Adam abruptly shuts the door in the man's face.

He goes to the window and looks out. The height scares

him to death. He jumps back.

INT. SHELTER, DINNER TABLE - SAME TIME

Adam's parents pray.

She begins to tear up and he pats her hand.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAWN

Adam sits by the window watching his first dawn.

EXT. HOLIDAY INN - MORNING

It's another bright, smoggy day.  And here comes Eve,

marching from the parking garage to the hotel entrance.

INT. FRONT DESK - MOMENTS LATER

Eve is speaking to a DESK CLERK.

INT. ADAM'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

He is seated on the bed, transfixed, watching a

television commercial.The PHONE RINGS loudly.  Adam

nearly jumps out of his skin.  After he figures out where

the ringing is coming from, he answers the phone.

INT. LOBBY

At the house phone.

INT. ADAM'S ROOM

Boy, is he glad to hear from her!

INT. LOBBY

Eve holds the receiver away from her for a moment.

INT. LOBBY, ELEVATORS - MOMENTS LATER

The doors open and Adam hurries out, looking for Eve, who

he sees and goes directly to, smiling all the while like

a rumpled idiot.

He takes the card.

She heads for the front door.  He goes after her.

EXT. HOTEL - DAY

They exit.

She stops, he stops.

He does.

She looks at him for a beat or two, then abruptly turns

away.

He follows closely. She stops.

He gives her his patented thumbs up sign which of course

is exactly like his father's.

He walks back to the hotel.

EXT. MARINE WHOLESALE SUPPLY, MARINA DEL REY - DAY

Heavy-duty BOAT BATTERIES are being loaded into a U-Haul

truck.  The store MANAGER steps up to Eve who is

watching. Adam appears in the bg, thanking and being nice

to the MEN loading the truck. He looks mighty stupid in

another one of his Dad's old outfits.

INT. PRICE CLUB - LATER SAME DAY

Eve and Adam shop with two carts, both full of CASES OF

DR. PEPPER.

He goes over to a huge supply of Prince Albert.

EXT. LOADING DOCK - SAME DAY

Eve and Adam watch as a man with a forklift puts a year's

supply of toilet paper into the back of the rental truck.

EXT. GROCERY STORE PARKING LOT - SAME DAY

A crowd has gathered to watch Adam and Eve empty seven

shopping carts full of non-perishable groceries.

ANGLE - 5 MINUTES LATER

Eve goes to get into the truck. Adam hurries by her.

He opens the door for her. She shakes her head and gets

in.

EXT. HOLIDAY INN - THAT NIGHT

She drives the truck to a stop. He keeps the beat to the

song on the AM radio. It's VolarE. Adam loves it. Eve

hates it. They come to a stop and she snaps off the

radio.

He gets out.

She pulls away.

EXT./INT. U-STORE-IT - NEXT DAY

Adam drags the last 50-pound bag of flour into a self-

storage locker and pulls down the sliding door which he

padlocks.

She hops in behind the wheel.  He (hurt) is a little

slower getting in his side.

EXT. FREEWAY - LATER, SAME DAY

Traffic is moving about forty miles an hour.  Their truck

is in one of the middle lanes.

INT. U-HAUL - CONTINUOUS

Adam screws up his guts and turns to her.

She is speechless. Then:

INT. DINER - LATER, SAME DAY

Adam and Eve are in a booth. The WAITRESS approaches with

sandwiches and drinks.

He and the waitress look to Eve for an answer.

The amazed waitress leaves.  Adam automatically lowers

his head and says grace.  Two HAPPENIN' GUYS at the

counter look over and chuckle at the rube.  Eve flips

them a mean bird and mouths the words "fuck you" as Adam

continues to pray. The guys shut up.

EXT. EVE'S HOUSE - LATE DAY

Eve shares a frame Santa Monica bungalow.  It's in a

pretty nice neighborhood on a quiet street.  Her GEO

FISHTAILS into the picture and comes to rest half in the

street, half on the curb.  Adam is driving.

She rips the keys out of the ignition.

They get out.

She storms off for the house where a YOUNG MAN is coming

out the front door in a cut-off T-shirt and spandex

exercise shorts.

EXT. PORCH

CLIFF is leaving with a cardboard box full of clothes.

He is exceedingly GOOD LOOKING AND IN VERY GOOD SHAPE.

Eve and Adam come up the steps.

She looks in the box.  Holds up a pair of old briefs.

Cliff smiles and bounces down the steps.

INT. EVE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Very good music is playing. Adam listens to one speaker

then crosses to listen to the other. Then he goes back to

the first.

INT.EVE'S KITCHEN - SAME TIME

Eve is pouring champagne into a glass that contains two

sugar cubes.  Next she adds several dashes of bitters.

TROY, HER GAY ROOMMATE, throws together a tray of

appetizers as dinner cooks on the stove.

He rushes out with the tray.

INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Troy enters with sushi appetizers. Adam is looking at the

ceiling.

Eve enters with Adam's drink and two white wines.

.

Eve and Troy look at each other as she hands him his

wine.

They do.

Adam holds out his hand and she takes it, rubbing her

finger slowly and gently around in his palm.  For her,

it's psychic stuff.  For him, it's spine-tingling.

She tosses back his hand and grabs her wine for a victory

gulp.

Troy jumps up and runs out of the room.

TROY'S OFFICE

He has "Alaska" on his computer screen.  Adam enters and

looks at the computer, which captivates him.

Troy exits. Adam follows.

(EDITORIAL:  Scenes 131, 132, and 133 should follow scene

134 rather than precede it.)

INT. SHELTER, MASTER BEDROOM - SAME TIME

Calvin Webber is sleeping soundly.  Helen stands quietly

at the door looking at him. She finishes off her

champagne cocktail and very quietly shuts the door.

INT. ANTEROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Helen goes into the elevator. Obviously, she's had too

much to drink.

INT. MALT SHOP - MOMENTS LATER

The floor rumbles and the metal doors open emitting the

red light.  Soda Jerk and TEN OF HIS FOLLOWERS stand up

expectantly and anxiously.  Helen appears--and looks at

this terribly odd assortment of people.

And they all fall down on their knees and worship her

with much wailing and rejoicing.  Several speak in

tongues. Helen stares at them wide-eyed, presses the

button on the control box, and goes back down.

INT. DINING TABLE - NIGHT

Adam's impeccable table manners serve to highlight Eve's

and Troy's utter lack of same.

Eve and Troy watch him eat for a beat or two.

She does. Eve and Troy emulate Adam.

SCENE 135 OMITTED

SCENE 136 OMITTED

EXT. EVE'S HOUSE - DAY

Troy and Adam get out of Eve's car with a lot of

packages. They head for the house.

INT. EVE'S HOUSE - SAME DAY

Eve is on the couch doing her toenails when Adam and Troy

enter. Adam is in a casually elegant outfit that looks

terrific. Both he and Troy are carrying lots of other

packages and garment bags. We see names like Gucci,

Armani and Lauren. Eve is visibly impressed by Adam's

makeover.

He reaches into a bag and removes a box that contains --

a pair of rollerblades.

SCENE 137A OMITTED

SCENE 137B OMITTED

SCENE 138 OMITTED

EXT. VENICE BEACH - LATER, SAME DAY

There is a most unusual band shell location on the beach

that is completely covered by graffiti. Eve and Troy sit

at one of the many stone tables watching Adam skate all

over the place. He wears spandex workout pants and a T-

shirt.

The starting CRANE SHOT begins on the nearly deserted

commercial section of Venice Beach and then takes us to

the band shell.

ANGLE - CLOSER

of him skating and them watching.

He heads out of the band shell. We follow him as he

skates into an area that has been given over to the

homeless. They sit around in their sleeping bags and

blankets and cheer (and jeer) Adam when he passes by. He

takes them to be more mutants.

EXT. BIKE PATH - CONTINUOUS

Adam skates to it and is amazed to see two very pretty

girls skating in their tiny bikinis. A nearly nude body-

builder guy goes by on a bike. Then Adam sees the ocean.

ANGLE - WAVES

breaking on the beach and rocks.

EXT. BEACH - MOMENTS

Adam tosses off his roller-blades and walks trance-like

towards the waves.

ANGLE - TROY AND EVE

appear on a dune behind him and watch.

ANGLE - ADAM

Adam raises his arms to greet the ocean, perhaps like a

Plains Indian would. Then he joyously runs into the surf

and dives.

ANGLE - TROY AND EVE

watching.

ANGLE - ADAM

He surfaces and throws his fists in the air.

ANGLE - TROY AND EVE

ANGLE - ADAM

Begin the record "YMCA" over this.

INT. EVE'S LIVING ROOM - NEXT DAY

Eve enters from her morning shower to find Troy and Adam

goofing to The Village People song. She gives Troy a

disapproving look.

(My hip daughters tell me that "YMCA" is enjoying a huge

rebirth of popularity at their parties. Apparently they

line dance to it.)

EXT. FREEWAY - SAME DAY

A helicopter shot follows the U-Haul in traffic.

(Continue music.)

EXT. SELF-STORAGE - SAME DAY

Adam and Eve fill a second storage site. (Continue

music.)

EXT. BASEBALL DIAMOND, PUBLIC PARK  - DAY

We see the infield of a gay softball team wheel a double

play.

ANGLE - TROY AND ADAM

Cheering the play with other gay fans.

Music ends.

INT. EVE'S KITCHEN - NEXT DAY (RAIN)

She looks out the back window at the rain and shakes her

head. She exits the back door with an umbrella.

EXT. EVE'S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

Eve hurries to Adam who is sitting on a lawn chair in the

middle of the small back yard, enjoying the rain. She

holds the umbrella over her head.

He hugs her.

She's uncomfortable with the hug. Wait a minute. No she's

not.

EXT. "THE FORTIES" NIGHT CLUB - SAME NIGHT

This hip, up-market club is based on a 1940's theme.

Establish the YOUTHFUL RICH arriving in their black four-

wheel vehicles and silver Porsches. Coats and ties. Eve,

Troy and Adam arrive on foot. Adam notices the valet

parking.

Eve looks like she owns the place.

INT. NIGHT CLUB ANTEROOM - SAME TIME

As they enter Adam grabs Troy, who is leading the way.

Adam and Troy follow Eve in. The club is NOISY AND

HOPPING. The house music is from the 40's. Adam, Eve and

Troy enter a long corridor of booths and walk forward.

Adam's got on that terrific dark suit. Women notice. Eve

notices them noticing.

Adam gives it a shot and goes too bored.

He gets vaguely bored but misses unimpressed by a mile.

He tries that. It's like watching a neon sign switch back

and forth:  First interested, then not.

He overplays that.

Adam enters the main room. Eve and Troy follow.

INT. MAIN ROOM

There is a bar, a seated section, and a dance floor with

a DJ booth. The DJ is in a white dinner jacket and does a

perfect Humphrey Bogart impression as he ad libs his

speel between records.

ANGLE - BAR

JASON and JONATHAN wave when they see Eve and Troy

approaching. They ad-lib hellos. Here, and at the tables,

the recorded MUSIC IS SO LOUD THEY MUST SPEAK OVER IT.

They shake.

Jason and Jonathan just stare at him.

A slightly drunk beauty named SOPHIE appears behind Eve.

Eve hates Sophie.

Sophie pushes her way right up to Adam.

Eve steps in and takes Adam's hand, drawing him away from

Sophie.

Eve leads Adam to a table. Troy follows.

INT. TABLE - TEN MINUTES LATER

Adam, Eve and Troy examine female patrons over drinks.

It's white wine for her, imported beer for Troy, and a

Rob Roy for Adam.

ANGLE - LOVELY BRUNETTE

slinking by.

ANGLE - TABLE

"This one" is a KILLER BLOND.

ANGLE OF MEN AND WOMEN

doing precisely that. Then:

BACK TO TABLE

INTERCUT - MISS SWEET

She's a pretty young thing with a sweet face.

Adam rises.

Adam nods and shoves off.

Eve puts her hand to her head -- hating herself and still

not  sure exactly why.

ANGLE - ADAM

crossing to Miss Sweet.

INT. HORS D'OEUVRES TABLE

Adam sheepishly approaches Miss Sweet, then gathers

himself:

Hi!

Miss Sweet stares at him for a beat or two, then

chuckles.

They both laugh.

ANGLE - EVE AND TROY

Stunned...as they watch Adam and Miss Sweet. Another

pretty young woman (HEATHER) joins Adam.

ANGLE - ADAM AND GIRLS

Heather is a friend of Miss Sweet's.

There's a slight beat before both girls laugh.

ANGLE - EVE AND TROY

More stunned. Eve finds that she very much hates watching

Adam having a good time with other healthy non-mutants.

ANGLE - ADAM AND HIS NEW FRIENDS

They head for the dance floor.

ANGLE - TROY AND EVE

watching.

ANGLE - THE FLOOR

A jitterbug song comes on and so does Adam.

He and Miss Sweet are a little rough on take-off, but

they hit smooth sailing soon enough. He's terrific at

picking up the new stuff she shows him.

ANGLE - EVE & TROY

They are shocked.

ANGLE - DANCE FLOOR

Heather cuts in on Miss Sweet as the other dancers stop

to watch someone who is so much better than them. The

three of them begin to dance together.

ANGLE - TROY & EVE

ANGLE - DANCE FLOOR/ EVE

Adam dances beautifully with the two women. We CUT BACK

AND FORTH between them and Eve.

ANGLE - DANCE FLOOR

Adam, Miss Sweet and Heather complete their dance with

great aplomb.  Other dancers applaud them. Someone is

WHISTLING LOUDLY OFF CAMERA.  Adam and his dance partners

look over to:

ANGLE - EVE

She is whistling like a guy calling his dog.  Troy is

embarrassed.

Eve points at Adam and beckons broadly for him to come

over -- a basketball coach calling her player off the

floor.

ANGLE - DANCE FLOOR

He leaves.

ANGLE - TABLE

as Adam comes over. The music is not so loud now.

Troy rises and exits.  Adam arrives and sits down.

Cliff steps up to the table.  Adam, automatically a

gentleman, rises and offers his hand.

Cliff barely shakes his hand.

Then he sits in Adam's seat.

They rise.  Cliff gestures to the chair.

Eve and Cliff go to the bar.  Adam sits down glumly.  He

looks across the room and catches the eye of Miss Sweet

who is seated at a table with Heather.  A GOOD LOOKING

GUY is hitting on them.  CUTTING BACK AND FORTH between

Adam and them we see Miss Sweet's smile escalate.  Then

she nudges Heather who also looks over and smiles. Adam

smiles back.  Finish with a CLOSER SHOT OF HIS POV of

Miss Sweet's hair, butt and legs.

ANGLE - BAR

Eve and Cliff are in cozy conversation at the bar.

Jonathan, Jason, and Sophie are in the bg.

ANGLE - Troy

returning from the restroom.  He is surprised to see Eve

at the bar with Cliff.  When he looks back at the dance

floor table, Adam is not there.

ANGLE - EVE AND CLIFF

Sipping wine.

WIDER - BAR

Adam steps closer, looking past Cliff at Eve.

He gives Adam a shove.

Cliff throws a right which Adam calmly blocks and

counters with a short right jab to Cliff's mouth,

snapping his head back.  It's not a big punch, but very,

very quick. It makes Eve mad and astonishes Troy, Jason

and Jonathan.

Cliff draws back another right.  Adam flicks out a quick

left to Cliff's cheek, again snapping his head back, but

not his body. (These aren't big movie hits.) Cliff takes

a beat or two then draws back his right fist again.  Adam

pops him in the nose. Cliff drops his right arm to his

side.

Seeing an opportunity, Cliff rears back with another

right. Adam deftly pops him in the mouth again with a

short right jab.

Troy, Jonathan and Jason say good night to him.  Cliff

walks unsteadily away bleeding from the mouth and both

nostrils. (Hopeful that no one has noticed that he's very

subtly just gotten the crap beat out of him.)

She exits. Adam looks over at Troy who shrugs.

EXT. EVE'S HOUSE - MIDNIGHT

Troy takes out his keys as he approaches the front door.

But the door opens. Eve stands there in sweats. Agitated.

INT. EVE'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Troy enters. She slams the door.

He enters the kitchen

INT. KITCHEN

She follows him: He gets something to drink.

.

Troy exits into his office.

INT. OFFICE

He plops down on the chair.

.

She exits, then sticks her hand back in.

She exits.

SCENE 148 OMITTED

EXT. HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Eve hurries out of the house leaving the front door wide

open.  She runs down the porch steps, across the yard,

and to her car, which she unlocks with the usual

fumbling.

INT. CAR

She jumps in and sticks the key in the ignition.  Adam

appears at the passenger window.

Eve SCREAMS BLOODY MURDER as she throws open her door and

jumps out into the street where she falls down, hurting

her knee.  Adam runs around the car to help her to her

feet. Dogs start barking in several houses.

Eve marches, with a limp, back to the house.

He chases her up the porch steps.

INT. LIVING ROOM - THIRTY MINUTES LATER

Lights are low and warm.  Adam is attempting to swab the

abrasion on Eve's knee through the tear in her old sweat

pants.

She reaches down and gives the knee hole a good rip,

revealing her leg from above the knee to the gym sock.

He takes the back of her calf in one hand and applies the

antiseptic to her knee with the other.  It stings and she

flinches.

He leans down and blows on the wound.  CU of that.  CU of

his hand on her calf.  CU of her looking down at him,

watching as he blows gently on her knee.

She reaches down, and taking hold of his collar, draws

him to her and they kiss very romantically and at length.

Then:

She sits up.

During the following speech CAMERA pushes past him and

lingers on her as she gradually realizes that Adam is

mental.

He rises.  She gets up and leads him to the door.

EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Adam comes out glowing with happiness. He looks

heavenward. And does his patented thumbs up.

Behind him we hear Eve locking all the locks on her front

door.

EXT. VALLEY AVENUE - DAY

A REFRIGERATED U-HAUL TRUCK lurches down the street.

INT. TRUCK

Adam struggles with the gears as Troy worries about his

driving skills.

He promptly pulls over and turns off the engine.

Adam jumps out of the truck and runs off.

EXT. ADULT BOOKSTORE - MOMENTS LATER

Adam runs up.  The bookstore looks familiar.  Adam runs

to the next store. It's a bar.  He runs to the next

store.  It's the Malt Shop.  Adam is thrilled.  He tries

the front door and at first it does not open.

INT. MALT SHOP

The Soda Jerk is leading about twelve followers in

prayers.

The front door opens and Adam peers in.  He sees the Soda

Jerk; smiles broadly at him and waves.  Then he closes

the

door.  The Soda Jerk grabs his heart and faints.  His

followers rush to his aid.

INT. TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER

Adam jumps in.

Adam would not have thought that.

INT. EVE'S HOUSE - AN HOUR LATER

Adam springs in, Troy drags in behind him (knowing the

deal). Eve is standing away from the door next to a kind

looking professional woman named Dr.Aron.

BROWN appears from the kitchen.  He's good-sized man who

dresses casually.  Adam becomes uneasy.

He nods politely.

The two come forward.  One opens the door and one beckons

for Adam to step out.

Adam looks back at Eve, who looks away. Adam exits.

She shuts the door. Troy sits dejectedly.

Eve goes to the window and watches as WE SEE ADAM BREAK

FROM BROWN AND RUN OFF with him chasing.

She runs out.  He follows.

EXT. STREET

Adam races down the sidewalk.  He cuts left and runs

between houses.  Brown is not as fast.

EXT. EVE'S FRONT YARD

Eve and Troy run out to Aron who is dialing her cell

phone.

Suddenly Adam appears from the side of the house,

startling everyone. He tosses his hotel key to Eve.

Aron looks around for Mr. Brown.

Adam jumps into the truck. Aron yells for him to stop.

Adam gets the truck in reverse and backs out of the

driveway and into a parked car.

Getting the truck in first, Adam has to go down the

sidewalk a bungalow or two before he can get back onto

the street.  He clips two parked cars as he does.  Brown

comes running from the side of the house.  His pants are

torn.

Brown has to grab her.

EXT. U-STORE-IT - LATER, SAME DAY

Eve and Troy arrive in her GEO to see that the two locker

doors are open and much of the stuff has been carried

off.  Eve drops her head in disappointment.

She gives him a look.

INT. SHELTER, PATIO - LATER, SAME DAY

Helen is using the hip-reduction machine while Calvin

reads, How to Win Friends and Influence People. The

distant sound of the hatchway being open gets their

attention.  Then:

They jump up and race into the living room, meeting Adam

halfway.   The parents kiss and hug their son before

noticing that he's got the Soda Jerk with him.

He promptly drops to his knees in supplication.

INT. ADAM'S HOTEL ROOM - DUSK

Eve and Troy look around.  She opens a drawer and sees

how nicely folded and put away things are.  Troy notices

"TV Guide" and the Gideon Bible sitting out with a page

marker in it.  He opens the night table drawer and takes

out the cigar box.

Eve nods.

INT. BATHROOM, ADAM'S HOTEL ROOM

Eve enters and looks at how tidy Adam's toiletries are;

how the comb is just right in the brush; how the tooth

paste (Ipanna in a '61 tube) has been squeezed from the

bottom; and at how he has hung up his socks to dry.  It

makes her very sad.  She picks up the toothpaste and

holds it as if it were his ring.

He enters with stock certificates and sees that she's

very close to crying.

Instead of taking the certificates, she hands him the

toothpaste and sits down on the bed in a funk.

He holds out the tube and she takes it to read.

EXT. REAR OF MALT SHOP - SAME TIME

Adam, the Soda Jerk and fifteen followers hurriedly

unload the truck, taking provisions into the back door of

the malt shop.

INT. JASON'S OFFICE - SAME TIME

Their pal Jason is on the phone with Troy.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - EARLY EVENING

Troy is on the phone.  Eve is standing, looking at the

stock certificates.

He slams down the phone and jumps to his feet.

She heads out.

They exit.

EXT. ADULT BOOKSTORE - NIGHT

Troy and Eve approach and enter.

INT. ADULT BOOKSTORE - NIGHT

The Pakistani looks up briefly when Eve and Troy enter.

There are two male customers in the bg. Eve taps her foot

on the floor hoping to hear a hollow sound.  But it is

solid.  She and Troy move about the store tapping their

feet and finally jumping up and down.  The Pakistani and

two customers become concerned.

He points to the rear of the store.

EXT. REAR MALT SHOP PARKING LOT - NIGHT

The Soda Jerk drives the rental truck away leaving the

lot empty and the door to the Malt Shop closed. Troy and

Eve appear after the truck is gone.

They turn left to get back to the avenue.

INT. EVE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The phone is ringing.  Then the recorder answers.

Beep,

EXT. AVENUE - NIGHT

Eve lets Troy drive.  She clutches the cigar box and

rests her head on the seat as they pull away from the

curb in front of the bookstore.  A low rider passes them

on the left.  Eve sees an old hag being shoved out of the

bar and a homeless man slipping into the abandoned malt

shop and the cross-dressing STREET WALKER making eyes at

passing cars and Adam hanging up the pay phone he just

used.

She rolls down her window.

ANGLE - ADAM

Turning when he hears Eve yell his name.

ANGLE - EVE

Running from the car.  The cigar box falls to the street

and the contents scatter.  Eve could care less.  Besides,

Troy is there to retrieve everything.

In a series of cuts and slo-mo action the couple race

into each other's arms...to the pleasure of all the

lowlifes mentioned above.  Now the street looks more like

Capra than Scorsese. She's surprised that she wants to

kiss him so bad. He's surprised that he gets so

aggressive.

INT. SHELTER, KITCHEN - LATER, SAME NIGHT

Helen watches Calvin work on the timing device for the

locks with a screwdriver.

They turn to see Adam walking forward with Eve.

Calvin knows a Russian name when he hears one. But he

chooses not to pursue it.

Calvin mixes drinks just like he did at the party in

1962. Adam is with him.

Helen races around, just like she did in 1962, getting

the roast ready. Eve. watches.

INT. - DINING ROOM

Helen hurries out of the kitchen to take her seat. The

others are already there.

Helen nearly comes unglued. Calvin is pleased, too. He

raises his tea cup.

The others also raise their cups and everyone clicks.

Then they drink.

They begin to eat.

They all join hands and lower their heads. Calvin leads

them.

Adam and Eve are with a REAL ESTATE BROKER. The broker

narration.

This is great stuff from the fifties and the sixties.

Adam and Eve embracing as Troy picks up baseball cards

and the street people look on.

Jerk.  In CU we see the Malt Shop exterior all dolled up

with a big lighted sign that says "GIVE ME SHELTER."

There's valet parking and the Adult Bookstore and Bar

have been turned into a Souvenir Center (think Planet

Hollywood).  Another drawing shows fashionable guests

boarding the elevator.

Other drawings show dancing on the shelter patio and

guided tours being shown various parts of the shelter.

EXT. BEAUTIFUL VALLEY NORTH OF L.A. - TWO MONTHS LATER

A 1962 Cadillac leads a 1962 windowless van through

the Cadillac. Adam is her passenger.

bonkers when they see the house.

device.  Calvin, the inventor, sticks his head into the

machine to investigate its workings.

Adam demonstrates the VCR to his parents as Troy and Eve

look on.

We see the main title to Natural Born Killers come up on

catch it.

Helen comes out with a tray of champagne cocktails.

INT. LIVING ROOM

Eve and Troy are sitting by the window.  Adam and Helen

come in to offer cocktails to Troy and Eve.

The CAMERA wanders off of them and shoots out the glass

doors. We see Calvin behind the house...measuring off the

dimensions for a fallout shelter.

Calvin continues to measure as we pull way back and up.

Perry Como sings "We'll Meet Again".
