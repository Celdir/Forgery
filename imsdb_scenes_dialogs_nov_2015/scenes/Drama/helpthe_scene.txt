WILLIAM FAULKNER wrote of Mammy Callie after her death:

"...she gave to my family a fidelity without stint or

calculation or recompense and gave to my childhood an

immeasurable devotion and love".

JACKSON, MISSISSIPPI 1963

INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

AIBILEEN, black, 53, sits at a table in a small, green

kitchen. She wears a yellow dress with black piping and

grips a tattered spiral notebook.

Although cracked, the window behind her is crystal clear.

Three framed portraits hang on the wall above her: John F.

Kennedy, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and an UNKNOWN YOUNG

BLACK MALE wearing thick glasses.

Aibileen swallows hard.

An UNSEEN WOMAN interviews Aibileen.

The woman repeats Aibileen's answer slowly as she writes.

Aibileen squeezes the notebook in her lap.

Aibileen gulps. She doesn't answer. The room is quiet.

Aibileen's hand trembles as she sips from a glass of water.

She glances sadly up to the picture of the young black male.

INT. LEEFOLT HOME - MAE MOBLEY'S ROOM - MORNING

MAE MOBLEY LEEFOLT, 2 1/2 years old, lies in a crib, crying.

AIBILEEN enters. Her dark black skin contrasts angelically

with a brilliant white work dress, white panty hose and shoes

Aibileen lifts Mae Mobley out of her crib and pulls her into

her expansive bosom.

Aibileen sits with Mae Mobley in a rocking chair.

Mae Mobley reaches up and touches Aibileen's face. Aibileen

kisses her and whispers in her ear.

Mae Mobley's mother, ELIZABETH LEEFOLT, 21 and lanky, enters

wearing a green dress very much under construction. Pins and

double-stick tape hold it all together.

Elizabeth has pointed features and a nest of teased, brittle

hair.

Elizabeth rotates around like the Tin Man.

Elizabeth exits with her pinned hemline sloping at a good

twenty degree angle. Aibileen shakes her head.

INT. JACKSON JOURNAL NEWSPAPAER - OFFICE - SAME DAY

A smoking RECEPTIONIST, 50, leads EUGENIA "SKEETER" PHELAN,

23, across a smoke-filled news office. Even the light bulbs

have yellowed.

Skeeter has very frizzy blond hair cut short above her

shoulders. She carries a red satchel.

She wears flats, careful not to add more than a centimeter to

her towering height. Dressed well, Skeeter tugs on her

unfamiliar attire.

INT. MR. BLACKLY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

The receptionist and Skeeter enter the office of MR. HAROLD

BLACKLY, 68. He has greased, grey hair and the face of a

mean man. Smoke pours into the room.

He snaps his fingers over a chair. Skeeter sits down.

Mr. Blackly pours a pack of nuts into his mouth.

Skeeter quickly hands Mr. Blackly a resume. He skims it

over, marking it violently with a red pen.

Mr. Blackly sighs, hands the resume back to Skeeter.

Skeeter nods slowly. She takes a deep breath and pulls a

letter out of her satchel. She hands it to Mr. Blackly.

Mr. Blackly snatches the letter and reads it quickly,

mouthing the words as he does. He drops the letter on his

desk, and looks to Skeeter, flabbergasted.

Skeeter's face flushes hot and quick.

Skeeter points toward the letterhead.

Mr. Blackly pours the rest of the peanuts in his mouth.

Mr. Blackly sees cigarette smoke bleeding under his door.

Mr. Blackly pulls up a box filled with letters and

newspapers. He slams it down in front of Skeeter.

Skeeter forces a smile.

Mr. Blackly picks up the phone and starts yelling at someone.

Skeeter excitedly grabs the box of letters and leaves.

INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - BATHROOM - SAME DAY

HILLY HOLBROOK, 22, white and hefty, sits on a closed toilet

seat in a well-appointed bathroom. She's covered in red plaid

and bows and has a round face topped by a perfect beehive.

Hilly carefully rolls toilet paper out from its holder. She

raises a pencil and places the tiniest dot imaginable on the

first and second sheets of paper.

She carefully rolls the paper back up in the roll.

INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - ENTRY FOYER STAIRWELL - SAME TIME

MINNY JACKSON, 33, black, plump and in uniform, rolls her

eyes beneath a crystal chandelier. She shouts up the

mahogany stairwell.

MISSUS WALTERS, 60, passes quietly behind Minny.

Minny jumps with a yelp, spins around.

Missus Walters ambles toward the closet door. Minny quickly

tries to turn her toward the front door. Missus Walters

resists.

Missus Walters opens the closet.

Missus Walters pulls out a red, wool coat with cheetah print

collar.

The early stages of Alzheimer's have appeared, but Missus

Walters is still quite proud at eighty percent capacity.

Hilly's approach is marked by the whishing sound of her

plaid, fat thighs.

She nonchalantly grabs the coat from her mother and carries

it out the door.

Minny and Missus Walters follow. Minny carries a chocolate

pie. Hilly barks over her shoulder.

Minny raises the pie behind Hilly's beehive, dreaming of

smashing it into her head.

INT. LEEFOLT HOME - BATHROOM- SAME DAY

Aibileen kneels next to Mae Mobley who sits on a small

children's training toilet.

Mae Mobley sticks her lip out.

Mae Mobley shakes her head.

Tee-tee immediately sprinkles into the bowl.

Aibileen and Mae Mobley laugh excitedly as Elizabeth storms

into the bathroom in her finished dress. The hemline now

slants in the other direction.

Mae Mobley rises behind Aibileen's leg.

Elizabeth reaches down and scoops up Mae Mobley like a sack

of potatoes.

Mae Mobley looks to Aibileen over her mother's shoulder, her

eyes have welled up.

Aibileen mouths "I love you" and blows her a kiss.

INT. LEEFOLT HOME - DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

The Leefolt's small, wood paneled, two bedroom "ranch" is

destined to become income property one day.

FIVE YOUNG WOMEN, early 20s, and Elizabeth hover around two

collapsible card tables arranged in the living room.

Aibileen methodically arranges grapes on a platter of chicken

salad resting on Elizabeth's dining table. The table has a

small L-SHAPED CRACK in the middle.

Elizabeth glances anxiously to the dining table then catches

eyes with Aibileen, nodding ever so slightly.

Aibileen carefully slides the platter over the L-SHAPED CRACK

making sure it's hidden.

Hilly enters the front door holding Missus Walters coat.

Minny follows behind holding the pie and Missus Walters' arm.

Minny spies Aibileen in the corner and gives her a "here we

go" look as she lowers Missus Walters into a chair.

Hilly approaches Aibileen with the coat.

Hilly extends the coat with a smile.

Aibileen takes the coat.

INT. LEEFOLT HOME - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Minny plows through the swing door and reaches for Hilly's

deviled eggs.

Aibileen rushes in behind her wearing the cheetah collared

coat. The sleeves are about a foot too short.

Aibileen pulls another plate of eggs out of the fridge.

Minny takes an egg. It disappears in a single bite.

Aibileen removes the coat and lays it over a chair.

Aibileen shakes with silent laughter.

INT. LEEFOLT HOME - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

Elizabeth and Hilly cackle with a group of girls as Missus

Walters sits on the couch watching "Guiding Light."

Skeeter suddenly rushes through the front door.

JOLENE FRENCH, 24, approaches and hugs Skeeter.

Skeeter spins around to Hilly and Elizabeth with a sigh.

Hilly and Elizabeth look at Skeeter with concern.

Hilly places her hand on Skeeter's shoulder.

Elizabeth nods.

Skeeter storms off. Hilly glares at Elizabeth.

INT. LEEFOLT HOME - LIVING ROOM - LATER THE SAME DAY

Aibileen clears the dining table as bridge begins.

Hilly, Elizabeth and Skeeter sit with Jolene. Skeeter takes a

deep breath and belts out her news.

Everyone looks at Skeeter as if she just threw up on herself.

Finally, Hilly pats Skeeter on the leg.

Jolene raises her glass.

Hilly kicks Jolene under the table.

Everyone laughs. Skeeter's forehead crinkles.

Aibileen clears dishes as if she hasn't heard a thing.

Elizabeth gets very still.

Skeeter looks to her lap and shakes her head.

What?! Oh, my gosh!

Skeeter nods her head sadly.

The girls nod.

Elizabeth looks to Aibileen.

A phone rings. Elizabeth nods to Aibileen.

INT. LEEFOLT HOME - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Aibileen rushes in the kitchen and answers the phone.

INT. FOOTE ESTATE (INTERCUT) - KITCHEN - SAME TIME

Pink, fuzzy slippers anchoring bare, sexy legs stand on a

black and white check floor.

Rising up a slim torso, sizeable cleavage bursts out of a

pink robe's collar.

CELIA FOOTE, 28, peroxide blonde, stands in all her country

girl glory.

She speaks with a thick, unrefined, Southern accent, mired in

insecurity.

Celia nervously twists herself around in the phone cord.

"Miss" strikes Aibileen as very odd.

Celia hands up the phone with a frown and sips from a coca-

cola bottle.

INT. LEEFOLT HOME - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Aibileen enters the living room with a coffee pot.

Elizabeth leans over and touches Hilly's arm.

All the girls laugh.

Everyone laughs but Skeeter. Aibileen pours Skeeter a cup of

coffee. Skeeter looks up decidedly and smiles.

Hilly begins squirming in her seat, obviously making a point.

Elizabeth leans over.

Missus Walters shouts out from the sofa.

Elizabeth turns to Aibileen.

Aibileen disappears. Elizabeth leans into Hilly.

Hilly hiss-whispers.

Aibileen turns the corner in the hall and stops.

Skeeter sees a reflection of Aibileen listening off of a

picture in the hall. Skeeter tries to change the subject.

Elizabeth takes a puff of her cigarette and fidgets with her

cards.

Skeeter again glances at Aibileen. Their eyes meet.

The room grows eerily quiet.

Hilly leans in toward Skeeter.

Jolene suddenly looks to a wall clock. She jumps up and

throws her cards to the table.

EXT. FOOTE ESTATE - BACKYARD - SAME DAY

Celia delicately prunes two rosebushes. Her long pink

fingernails wrap easily around a pair of sheers.

As Celia stands back to admire her work, We widen to see the

Foote estate. Ancient oaks dripping in Spanish moss surround

a perfectly manicured lawn. "Tara" pales in comparison.

Oddly, the two rosebushes have been planted in the center of

the lawn, jeopardizing the Antebellum Feng Shui.

JOHNNY FOOTE, 23, Celia's ridiculously handsome husband,

sneaks up behind her as he removes his jacket and tie.

Celia turns with a yelp. She slaps him playfully.

Johnny begins kissing her neck.

Celia pushes him back.

Johnny kisses her again and lowers her to the grass.

Johnny starts kissing Celia's breasts. She becomes uneasy

and rolls out from under him.

Johnny brushes hair from Celia's face.

Celia seductively bites her lower lip.

Johnny's hand slides up her thigh.

INT. LEEFOLT HOME - KITCHEN - LATER THAT DAY

Bridge over, Skeeter smokes while watching through a window

as Minny arrives in Hilly's car. Skeeter blows smoke toward

Hilly and Elizabeth saying good-bye.

A sermon plays over an old AM radio nestled between

canisters of sugar and flour.

Aibileen enters with a stack of dirty coffee cups.

Aibileen becomes nervous at the sight of Skeeter alone.

Aibileen nods and looks out to Elizabeth on the street.

Aibileen doesn't respond. She grabs a basket of rolls.

Aibileen quickly turns her back to Skeeter. A gospel choir

begins singing on the radio.

Aibileen starts wiping down a serving tray.

Skeeter turns to Aibileen as she puts out her cigarette.

Skeeter moves closer to Aibileen.

Aibileen stops wiping and looks up to Skeeter...

Aibileen turns and resumes wiping the tray.

Aibileen slowly turns back to Skeeter.

Aibileen shrugs her shoulders, reeling it all back in.

Just then, Elizabeth walks into the kitchen holding papers

stapled together. She looks between Aibileen and Skeeter.

Skeeter and Aibileen shake their heads.

Elizabeth hands Skeeter the papers. Home Help Sanitation

Initiative is written on the cover.

Skeeter nods.

Elizabeth looks at Aibileen.

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - LATER THAT DAY

Skeeter speeds down a country road lined with ancient oak

trees in a white Cadillac.

Her frizzy hair swirls about as she passes a truck full of

cotton.

INT. CADILLAC (FANTASY SEQUENCE) - SAME TIME

Skeeter looks ahead and sees an OLDER BLACK WOMAN walking

with a LITTLE BLONDE GIRL, 6. They hold hands.

The black woman smiles and waves as Skeeter passes. When

Skeeter looks in her rear view mirror, they're gone.

Skeeter suddenly stops the car just short of an intersecting

gravel road.

Skeeter slowly turns down the old road.

EXT. CONSTANTINE'S HOUSE - DAY

Skeeter's car pulls into the overgrown yard of an old shack

with a rusted-out tin roof.

Two clapboard rooms are separated by an open breezeway. The

front door is cracked opened.

Skeeter gets out and walks toward Constantine's home.

INT. CONSTANTINE'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Skeeter enters to find only a small bed, dresser, table,

rocking chair and a wood burning stove.

Past intruders have long since taken anything of value.

As Skeeter approaches Constantine's bed, an OPOSSUM scurries

out from underneath.

Skeeter screams as the opossum runs out the door. Her eyes

suddenly catch something.

Lying on the bed is an OLD CORN PIPE.

Skeeter picks it up and brings it to her face. Her eyes

begin to well up.

EXT. PHELAN PLANTATION - MOMENTS LATER

Skeeter pulls in front of a grand antebellum home and parks

to the side of her family's graveyard.

Skeeter carries her black dress up the stairs of a covered

porch.

An old black man with white hair, JAMESO, 70, tightens a

porch swing.

INT. PHELAN PLANTATION - ENTRY FOYER - MOMENTS LATER

Skeeter walks through the front door.

If the Smithsonian had wished to assemble the perfect

antebellum home, Skeeter would be standing in it.

INT. PHELAN HOME - PARENTS' BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Skeeter enters and looks around curiously at an ARRAY OF WIGS

resting atop a dresser.

Skeeter's mother, CHARLOTTE BOUDREAU CANTELLE PHELAN, 50,

glides into the room wearing a wig. Her floral print dress

has a gazillion perfectly pressed pleats.

Charlotte turns to a mirror and adjusts an auburn-colored,

`pixie' cut.

Charlotte removes the wig with a sigh. Only now do we

realize her decision to wear wigs isn't elective. Thinning

hair detracts from her perfectly made up face.

Charlotte puts on a classic bouffant/flip in dark brown.

Charlotte unzips the dress and takes it off.

Charlotte winces with pain and grasps her stomach.

Charlotte stands in her slip and bra holding the dress.

Skeeter begins taking off her clothes.

She lowers the dress over Skeeter's head and zips it.

A diploma. A pretty piece of paper.

Charlotte plumps up the dress around Skeeter's behind.

With that, Charlotte grabs Skeeter's hand and takes her to a

love seat. They sit. This is serious.

Charlotte begins to twist the handkerchief she holds.

Charlotte shuts her eyes tight.

Skeeter jumps up.

Skeeter storms out of the room.

INT. PHELAN PLANTATION - DINING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

The Phelan dining room is lit solely by candles.

The Phelan's new maid, PASCAGOLUA, 40, rolls a cart of

casseroles around the table.

Charlotte sits at the head of the table. She's having a bowl

of broth.

Skeeter sits next to her Father, ROBERT PHELAN, 60.

Skeeter's brother, CARLTON, 25, sits next to his fiance,

REBECCA, 21. They're perfectly groomed with Hollywood good

looks.

Charlotte scoops up some broth with a spoon.

Charlotte's spoon goes in her mouth.

Pascagolua tries to scoop some sort of casserole covered in

almonds onto Skeeter's plate. Skeeter stops her.

Charlotte glares at Skeeter. Carlton lets out a chuckle.

Rebecca is mortified.

Pascagolua scurries off. Skeeter turns to her father...

The room grows silent. Carlton looks down to his plate.

Skeeter looks to her mother who immediately busies herself

with scooping up more broth.

Charlotte slaps the table and stands.

Skeeter's eyes fill with tears...

Charlotte presses both hands to her stomach.

Charlotte passes behind Rebecca and kisses her head.

As Charlotte leaves the room, Rebecca looks at Skeeter like

she's the worst person on earth.

Skeeter gets up and storms off into the entry foyer.

INT. PHELAN PLANTATION (FLASHBACK) - ENTRY FOYER - NIGHT

Skeeter, 13 and lanky, wears a party dress. Despite a tight

bun, her strong-willed hair has started to frizz.

Skeeter's father and brother race down the stairs with

suitcases. Carlton wears a varsity sweater.

Robert and Carlton race outside as Charlotte enters, healthy

and glowing.

A horn blows. Charlotte kisses Skeeter on the cheek and then

looks over to CONSTANTINE, 50.

Constantine stands tall. Her skin is black as night. Her

eyes have a striking honey colored hue to them. She wears a

white sleeping gown.

The horn blows again. Charlotte is out the door.

Skeeter turns to Constantine who is all smiles.

EXT. PHELAN PLANTATION (FLASHBACK) - PATIO - MOMENTS LATER

Skeeter sits at a picnic table smoking a cigarette.

Constantine smokes tobacco out of a corn pipe.

Skeeter looks down to her long, bony legs.

Constantine grabs Skeeter's hand and presses her thumb firmly

to her palm.

Constantine lets go of Skeeter's palm and wipes a tear from

her face.

Constantine laughs.

Tight on Skeeter's face as Constantine gives her a big hug.

INT. PHELEN PLANTATION - SKEETER'S BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING

Skeeter lies in bed staring holes into the ceiling as a

rooster announces the morning.

A sudden revelation washes over her. In a flash, Skeeter is

out of bed and running down the stairs.

INT. PHELAN PLANTATION - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Pascagoula tends to a skillet full of eggs next to a black

and white TV resting on the counter.

CLOSE ON TELEVISION:

Jolene French attempts to deliver the weather on WLBT.

Jolene pivots to camera, lowers her chin and smiles.

Skeeter runs past Pascagoula with a phone and disappears

inside the pantry.

INT. HARPER AND ROW PUBLISHING - OFFICE - NEW YORK - LATER

ELAINE STEIN, 45, hard but stylish, talks on the phone in a

large corner office. She lights a cigarette and swivels her

chair toward the Manhattan skyline.

INT. PHELAN PLANTATION (INTERCUT) - PANTRY - SAME TIME

Skeeter sits on a huge sack of flour. A millennium's supply

of can goods fills the shelves.

Miss Stein's swivels her chair back around and sits up.

Charlotte knocks on the pantry door.

Skeeter covers the mouth piece and opens the door.

Skeeter slams the door.

Skeeter leans back against the shelves.

Skeeter panics.

Skeeter can't believe what just came out of her mouth. Miss

Stein rises and sits on the edge of her desk.

Skeeter blinks hard. No turning back now.

She hangs up.

INT. LEEFOLT HOME - KITCHEN - LATER THAT DAY

Skeeter sits across the table from Aibileen, reading the

`Miss Myrna' letters.

Outside, winds howl, and the sky grows dark. Jolene's

forecast appears to be a bit off.

Skeeter chuckles and shrugs her shoulders.

Skeeter writes this down.

Skeeter keeps writing. Aibileen notices something outside.

Hilly walks into the Leefolt backyard with her son, BILLY, 3,

perched on her hip.

A CONTRACTOR, 30s, follows holding a set of plans.

Skeeter turns to the open window. It's already started to

sprinkle outside.

The contractor nods. Lightning strikes, thunder cracks.

Hilly is off and running with Billy. Skeeter seizes the

moment.

Aibileen turns slowly from the window.

Aibileen's eyes fall to the floor.

Aibileen jumps up as another crack of thunder sounds out.

Skeeter rises.

Aibileen stops at the refrigerator, gripping the life out of

its handle.

Aibileen begins to perspire. She grabs the counter to steady

herself, then moves toward her chair.

Aibileen shakes her head.

Bam! The front door slams shut.

INT. LEEFOLT HOME (INTERCUT) - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

Soaking wet, Elizabeth and her husband, RALEIGH, 25, stand

toe to toe.

Aibileen hears Mae Mobley crying, but she is frozen.

INT. LEEFOLT HOME - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Raleigh storms in and is surprised to see Skeeter.

Raleigh storms out as Elizabeth charges into the kitchen.

Aibileen runs off. Elizabeth sees Skeeter and tries to

compose herself.

Skeeter gathers her things.

INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - DEN - LATER THAT DAY

The storm has escalated. The Holbrook house is without

power. Hilly runs around lighting candles.

Missus Walters lies on the couch while Minny fans her with a

newspaper.

Minny stops and begins squirming with discomfort. Missus

Walters notices her looking out to the garage bathroom.

Lightning strikes. Leaves blow across the yard. Hilly plops

down in a chair with a candle.

Minny hesitates. She gulps.

As Minny turns, Missus Walters calls out to her.

Minny looks outside just as wind slams an aluminum lawn chair

against the garage bathroom.

Boom! Another crash of thunder. Large hail stones begin

falling in the yard.

INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - BATHROOM - SECONDS LATER

Minny sneaks into the guest bath with a candle and shuts the

door. She carefully lowers the seat and sits. Relief

spreads across her face.

There's a knock on the door. She freezes.

Minny panics, staying completely quiet.

INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE (INTERCUT) - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Hilly leans into the bathroom door.

Minny gets up quickly and flushes the toilet. Hilly beats on

the door.

Outside the house, an eerie, groaning sound, much like a

freight train, intensifies.

The top of a huge tree snaps off and falls against the house,

shattering a window.

Minny crouches down and covers her head. A draft sucks the

candle's flame toward the bottom of the door.

INT. LEEFOLT HOME - MAE MOBLEY'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Aibileen sits with Mae Mobley against an interior wall,

holding a mattress on top of them and humming in her ear.

head toward the dark, swirling horizon.

relentless hail storm pummels her two rosebushes.

Within seconds, the rose blossoms are gone.

INT/EXT. BATHROOM/BACKYARD (INTERCUT) - THREE MONTHS LATER

Aibileen uses the newly completed bathroom Hilly has built in

the garage. The walls consist of unpainted plywood with a

small window hugging the ceiling.

Beads of sweat glisten on Aibileen's forehead under a single

bulb hanging above.

Well into her second pregnancy, Elizabeth exits the house

with Mae Mobley at her side. She wears an awful, homemade

maternity dress.

Aibileen reaches behind and flushes the toilet. Mae Mobley

gets excited and points to the garage bathroom.

Mae Mobley walks toward the bathroom and calls out.

Elizabeth grabs her and forces her down on the back step.

Aibileen pulls up her panty-hose.

EXT. BUS STOP - LATER THAT AFTERNOON

Aibileen waits with YULE MAY, 45, as well as other maids and

black males at a bus stop. Yule May is tall, pretty and

graceful. Her hair is pulled tightly into a bun.

Skeeter walks down the sidewalk toward them. She and

Aibileen catch eyes. Skeeter waves.

Yule May inches away from Aibileen. One BLACK MAN in

particular looks with concern as Skeeter walks up.

Aibileen nods nervously, looking at the other domestics.

A bus pulls up.

Yule May and others board. Skeeter grabs Aibileen's arm.

Aibileen signals to Yule May to go on ahead without her.

The bus pulls away.

Skeeter hands Aibileen a piece of paper with her phone number

written on it. Aibileen turns and walks off down the

sidewalk.

bus stop.

As Aibileen ambles toward a bench, TWO WHITE WOMEN in nurse

uniforms push in front of her and sit.

INT. MISSISSIPPI LAW LIBRARY - NEXT MORNING

Skeeter sits at a long table surrounded by books piled high

as if to provide a shield of sorts.

at the edges. It's titled:

Skeeter opens the booklet and begins reading.

INT. AIBILEEN'S HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Aibileen sits at a table wearing a nightgown. She carefully

combs and styles her wig for work in the morning.

She picks up the phone again and begins to dial.

EXT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - NEXT NIGHT - DUSK

Wearing a black scarf over her hair and clutching her red

satchel, Skeeter approaches a small, one-story wood

structure. White paint peels, hydrangeas fill the yard.

Skeeter spies an old pickup truck parked on the side of

Aibileen's house, completely covered in years of dust.

Skeeter checks over her shoulder several times. The porch

steps creak under her big feet.

Aibileen quickly opens the door and waves her inside.

INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Aibileen wears the same yellow dress she wore in the first

scene.

Skeeter nods.

Skeeter stares Aibileen up and down. Aibileen self-

consciously flattens our her dress.

Aibileen motions for Skeeter to sit on a narrow sofa behind a

coffee table covered in hand-tatted lace.

A tray holds a teapot, two cups that don't match and cookies

resting on folded napkins.

As Aibileen pours the tea, her hand shakes.

Skeeter sips her tea.

Aibileen watches as Skeeter takes a bite of the cookie.

Aibileen is quiet for a moment. She shakes her head.

INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

We continue with the interview seen on page one.

Aibileen glances up to the framed picture of Treelore.

Aibileen nods. Skeeter stares at her list of questions.

INT. JUNIOR LEAGUE HEADQUARTERS - MORNING

Hilly stands at a podium banging a gavel. The pleats of her

navy blue sailor's number fan out like an accordion.

A room full of JUNIOR LEAGUE MEMBERS sits up and quiets down.

Half the girls are pregnant and most all drink TAB and are

smoking. Skeeter sits in the back next to Elizabeth.

The girls applaud, turning to each other with praise.

More applause. Those who aren't pregnant, stand. Hilly

beams. Elizabeth nudges Skeeter out of her chair.

Now, even the pregnant women stand. Elizabeth grabs

Skeeter's arm and pulls herself up.

This sets off a room of whispers.

Everyone turns to Skeeter. Elizabeth panics.

As Skeeter rises, several women shake their heads.

Skeeter glances at the initiative tucked in her satchel.

EXT. LEAGUE HEADQUARTERS - PARKING LOT - LATER THAT DAY

INT. MINNY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

Minny is again wearing her maid's uniform. She puts two

plates of food down on the kitchen table.

Minny grabs Sugar's face and looks her right in the eyes.

Sugar jerks her face away and sticks her lip out.

Sugar nods.

EXT. RURAL BUS STOP - LATER THAT MORNING

Minny steps off a bus and walks down an old country road.

stairs leading up to the front porch.

Minny takes her first step on the stairs.

Minny slowly raises her hand to knock on the front door.

The door flies open. Celia Foote answers. She's covered in

tight pink clothes. Flour covers her face and hair.

Minny looks down disapprovingly to Celia's bare feet.

INT. FOOTE ESTATE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Minny enters behind Celia gawking at the flour massacre.

Minny catches herself.

INT. FOOTE ESTATE - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Minny and Celia enter a huge dining room. Minny gawks at a

dusty mahogany table surrounded by twelve chairs.

Minny spies a framed battle-worn Confederate flag complete

with bullet holes.

Celia lowers her head in shame...

Celia changes the subject.

Celia grabs Minny's hand. Annoyed, Minny pulls it away.

INT. FOOTE ESTATE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Minny stands at the base of a massive, stuffed Grizzly bear.

It clears the twelve-foot ceiling by an inch.

Aibileen nods. Minny's face hardens.

Minny scowls at Skeeter.

Skeeter is petrified. Her face reddens.

Minny storms out the back door. Skeeter looks like she might

get sick.

Minny immediately storms back in the kitchen.

Skeeter nods, trembling as Minny slides a chair in the middle

of the kitchen and sits.

Still trembling, Skeeter slides her chair from the table and

just sits there staring at Minny.

Aibileen grabs her notebook and begins writing.

INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - HOURS LATER

Just as Aibileen fills the first notebook, Skeeter hands her

another from her satchel.

INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - SUNRISE

The first signs of morning sun filter into the kitchen.

Minny spins around to Aibileen with sudden realization...

Crisco.

The doorbell rings. Celia runs off to answer.

INT. PHELAN PLANTATION - KITCHEN - DAY

Skeeter sits with a towel draped across her shoulders.

Charlotte, now in an auburn wig, squirts mounds of goo from a

pink tube onto Skeeter's hair.

She begins twisting Skeeter's hair into gooey spikes.

Skeeter resembles a papier mache starfish.

Charlotte takes a drag from her cigarette, then lifts up a

silver machine complete with power cord and rubber hose.

Charlotte puts a shower cap device on Skeeter's head and

reads from the Shinolator manual.

Charlotte flips a switch and takes another drag. The machine

groans to life. Skeeter's cap inflates.

INT. PHELAN PLANTATION - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Skeeter sits under the Shinolator buried in a magazine.

Skeeter leaves her mother in a cloud of dust.

INT. FARM TRUCK - COUNTRY ROAD - MOMENTS LATER

Chunks of mud fly off the tires. The June sun has set the

truck's interior at a stubborn 115 degrees.

Skeeter has no choice but to lower her window. The

Shinolator meets its match.

A mangy, STRAY CAT suddenly jumps out in the road. When

towing 10,000 pounds of farm equipment, slowing down quickly

isn't an option.

A loud thud sounds out from the truck's grill.

INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - PARLOR - LATER THAT NIGHT

Hilly, her husband, WILLIAM, and Skeeter's date, STUART

WHITWORTH, drink high balls and eat cheese in the Holbrook

parlor. Gold swag curtains hang on the windows.

Balding and pudgy, only William's family money once made him

a desirable bachelor. Stuart, on the other hand, is very

handsome, the "Marlboro Man" in a well-tailored suit.

Yule May (who we met earlier at church with Aibileen) now

works for Hilly. She clears empty glasses.

Stuart feigns interest.

Ice slams against Stuart's teeth as he downs his drink.

Hilly pats William's leg then turns with concern to a

grandfather clock announcing half past the hour.

The front door flies open. Skeeter enters completely out of

breath and sweaty. Her HAIR HAS TRIPLED IN SIZE. She waves.

As Hilly races toward Skeeter, William and Stuart stand.

Stuart is as tall as he is handsome.

making eye contact.

Stuart nods. Hilly rolls her eyes.

Hilly pinches Stuart on the cheek.

Skeeter and Hilly watch as Stuart's and William's eyes fix on

the front of the restaurant.

Celia and Johnny have entered. Celia wears a tight green

dress and the reddest lipstick ever put in a tube.

Hilly scowls.

Celia spots Hilly and gives a self-conscious wave.

with Stuart's drink and the water backs.

Tables begin to stare.

As Skeeter walks away, she purposefully slides her purse into

a glass of water, knocking it over into Stuart's lap.

INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - DINING ROOM - MORNING

Hilly and William each have a section of newspaper in their

face as Yule May clears breakfast dishes. Yule May lingers

nervously.

her hands.

William leaves.

Hilly draws in a deep breath as does Yule May.

Yule May's eyes widen as a hopeful smile forms.

Hilly raises the paper up to her face as Yule May exits.

INT. WHITE GROCERY STORE - LATER THAT MORNING

Minny and Aibileen, in uniform, push carts side by side in

the grocery store. The white shoppers are dressed casually.

Other maids in the store (all required to be in uniform while

shopping) keep quietly to themselves.

White women smile and chat with one another as they meander

down the aisles as if the black maids aren't even there.

Minny suddenly spots Celia in the produce section. She pulls

Aibileen close as they peer around the corner.

Aibileen's mouth drops open at the sight of Celia's shorts

and tight sweater. Celia is having trouble selecting

produce.

Celia walks up to a maid, grabs her, and pulls her to the

tomatoes. The maid, clearly uncomfortable, selects a tomato,

hands it to Celia, and scurries away.

Aibileen just nods.

Celia squeezes a canteloupe with another scared maid.

EXT. BUS STOP - MOMENTS LATER

Aibileen and Minny continue their conversation while waiting

with several other maids at a bus stop in front of the store.

the bus stop with her three Children. SONS, 10 and 3, and a

DAUGHTER, 8.

Aibileen and Minny nod as the Evers walk past and sit on a

bench.

A bus pulls up and the doors open. Minny, Aibileen and the

other maids step aside to let the Evers family board first.

EXT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - BACK YARD - LATER THAT DAY

Aibileen has come along to aid Yule May with Elizabeth's baby

shower.

A table is set in the middle of the yard covered in white

linens and Hilly's best sliver.

Hilly's son sits on her lap. The other girls' children wear

bathing suits jumping noisily in and out of two plastic kiddy

pools.

Yule May clears cake plates while Aibileen removes crumbs

with a sterling crumb scraper.

Mae Mobley wanders up to the table. Her belly almost looks

distended crammed inside last year's one piece.

Elizabeth turns to Mae Mobley but never gets up.

All the women laugh except for Skeeter.

Elizabeth looks down to her plate. Aibileen sets down the

scraper and kneels down to Mae Mobley.

Hilly begins bouncing William Jr. on her knee.

Hilly nods with a tight smile and glances to the ground at

Skeeter's red satchel.

Hilly narrows her eyes at Skeeter and turns to Aibileen.

Hilly stays on Aibileen, waiting for her to say something.

Skeeter fumes, hoping Aibileen doesn't say it.

Hilly smiles and nods.

Hilly shoots Skeeter a last look. William Jr. leans into

Hilly and hugs her.

Hilly kisses her son gently.

Hilly again glances to the red satchel, staring quizzically

at the worn booklet of The Jim Crow laws sticking out.

INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER THAT DAY

"good-byes" on the street. Skeeter slips into the kitchen.

cackling out on the street.

Yule May closes the kitchen door.

Skeeter and Yule May turn to find Hilly standing in the

swinging door leading into the dining room.

Skeeter notices that Hilly is holding the booklet of Jim Crow

laws in her hand.

Eyes down, Yule May hurries out of the kitchen.

Hilly holds up the Jim Crow booklet.

Skeeter snatches the booklet from Hilly.

INT. PHELAN PLANTATION - SKEETER'S BEDROOM - NEXT DAY

out: "Home Help Sanitation Initiative."

Skeeter picks up Hilly's document and shakes her head. She

types: Don't risk your children's and family's health!

INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Yule May vacuums. She pulls the sofa away from the wall to

clean beneath it.

Noticing something on the floor, Yule May leans over.

She rises holding a SMALL RUBY RING. Years of dust and hair

blanket the pitiful gem set in ten karat gold.

The vacuum seems to roar louder now. Yule May breathes

heavily. She shoves the ring into her uniform pocket.

INT. PHELEN PLANTATION - SKEETER'S BEDROOM - THAT AFTERNOON

As Skeeter bangs away on her typewriter, Charlotte bursts

into the room, stuck somewhere between panic and joy.

Charlotte pulls a sun dress out of Skeeter's closet.

INT. PHELAN PLANTATION - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Skeeter, Charlotte and Stuart sit in the living room.

Pascagoula serves finger sandwiches.

Stuart looks nice in khaki pants, a blue blazer and a red

tie. His nose is pink from working in the sun.

No one says a word. Finally...

Skeeter shoots her mother a "What the..." look.

Charlotte moves on.

Charlotte's jaw drops to her string of pearls.

Stuart nods. Charlotte stands, flustered yet joyful.

Charlotte backs away behind Stuart's chair. She points at

Skeeter violently, as if to say, DON'T MESS THIS UP!

EXT. PHELAN PLANTATION - BACK YARD - MOMENTS LATER

Skeeter and Stuart stand beneath an old Cypress tree as

Charlotte peeps from an upstairs window.

Stuart shoves his hands in his pockets like a boy.

Skeeter refuses to pity him.

Stuart looks up and starts laughing loudly.

Stuart looks down and nods.

Stuart turns and walks towards his car, self-consciously

weaving his strong fingers through his hair.

Skeeter looks up to her mother's empty window and shouts out

to Stuart.

Stuart turns.

INT. ROBERT E. LEE HOTEL - DINING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

Skeeter and Stuart sit closely as the same waiter as before

approaches.

Only now does Skeeter notice the tray of champagne the waiter

is holding. Stuart nods as two glasses are set before them.

The waiter leaves.

Skeeter laughs and slaps him playfully.

Stuart suddenly leans over and kisses Skeeter.

EXT. DRIVE-IN-MOVIE - ONE WEEK LATER

Stuart and Skeeter make out HARD in the back of the

Holbrook's convertible. Hilly and William sit in the front.

Hilly peers into the rearview mirror to get a better view.

Proud of herself, she pats William's leg.

William slides his hand up Hilly's leg. She jerks it away.

EXT. LEEFOLT HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

Aibileen sits on the kitchen floor next to a bucket. She

feverishly scours grease off the baseboards.

Elizabeth's car pulls up. Aibileen smiles.

The car door slams shut.

Aibileen rises slowly, placing a hand on her knee. Outside,

Elizabeth suddenly shouts out hysterically.

Aibileen panics. She gets up, looks out the window.

INT. LEEFOLT BACKYARD - SAME TIME

Mae Mobley sits on Aibileen's toilet in the garage. Door

wide open, pants around her ankles.

Elizabeth runs over and yanks Mae Mobley off, popping her

hard on the behind.

whispers and yanks Mae Mobley hard on the arm.

Elizabeth punctuates with three more slaps to her legs.

INT. LEEFOLT HOME - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Aibileen sits on the couch with Mae Mobley who eats a cookie.

Mae Mobley's face is red and damp.

Aibileen sits back down and leans into Mae Mobley.

Elizabeth suddenly barges into the living room.

Elizabeth runs outside. Aibileen grabs Mae Mobley.

EXT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Elizabeth wobbles briskly up the street holding her pregnant

belly. Aibileen and Mae Mobley follow.

A stream of people walk toward them, laughing.

They round a corner to see FIFTY OLD TOILETS, in every shape

and color imaginable, littering Hilly's lawn.

Some have towering tanks with chain pulls at the top,

providing amusement to the procession of cars driving by.

The Holbrook's station wagon sits in the driveway, doors

still open with LUGGAGE tied to the roof.

Two OLD BLACK MEN struggle to remove a toilet under William's

supervision.

Aibileen hides her smile. Mae Mobley points.

Hilly flies out of her house as a REPORTER snaps a picture of

her.

Hilly pushes him in the bushes and runs up to Elizabeth.

Hilly faces the toilets again and screams.

Hilly steps up to Aibileen and points to the old men.

INT. BUS - LATER THAT NIGHT

Aibileen rides in the back of a bus with a YOUNG BLACK MAN.

Two white men sit right behind the white driver.

The bus slows to a stop in the middle of the road.

In the distance, blue lights flash in front of a road block.

A few people gather.

As the driver gets up, a WLBT-TV news truck whizzes by

followed by a police motorcycle. Aibileen leans in the aisle

and looks ahead.

The driver returns. The young black man speaks up.

As the young black man helps Aibileen down the aisle, a white

passenger taps the driver on the shoulder.

Aibileen and the young man walk down the stairs.

The bus door shuts and the driver backs away.

EXT. STREET - MINUTES LATER

Aibileen and the young man walk along a dark street. The

sound of cicadas and sirens fill the air.

Aibileen turns to discover the young man is gone. She stares

into the darkness. Scared, she begins to run.

She cuts through a yard and trips over a hedge. She falls

hard to her knees.

Terrified, Aibileen begins to sob. She sees Minny's porch

light and pulls herself up.

INT. MINNY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - SECONDS LATER

Minny sits with all five of her children, Sugar, LEROY JR,

12, KINDRA, 10, FELICIA, 6, and BENNY, 4. They all listen

anxiously to a radio on the table.

Aibileen opens the screen door and falls to the floor.

Minny jumps up to help her. She sees blood and grass stains

streaking the knees of Aibileen's panty hose.

Aibileen nods, trying to compose herself.

Aibileen swallows hard.

Minny raises her fists.

Minny turns to Sugar.

Sugar leads the kids to the back of the house.

Minny and Aibileen grab hands and squeeze hard.

Aibileen hugs Minny.

Aibileen and Minny laugh a little through the tears.

INT. HARPER AND ROW PUBLISHING - OFFICE - NEW YORK

Elaine Stein sits at her desk flipping through the New York

Minny walks in, notices it's eerily quiet.

INT. FOOTE ESTATE - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Minny walks into Celia's bedroom.

Minny hears running water and muffled crying behind the

bathroom door. She presses her ear to the door.

Minny twists the knob. It's locked.

Celia yells at Minny for the very first time.

Minny sees water creeping out from under the door. She steps

back and charges, shoulder first.

INT. FOOTE ESTATE - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

The bathroom door bursts open with splinters of wood. Minny

slips in a pool of watered down blood.

Celia sits against the wall in a bloody nightgown.

Celia aimlessly moves the blood around with a wash cloth.

Minny crawls over, peers into the toilet bowl and gags.

Shaken, Minny reaches for a trash can. She puts her hand on

Celia's neck and pushes it down.

INT. FOOTE ESTATE- BEDROOM - LATER THAT DAY

Celia lies in bed while Minny presses a cool rag to her

forehead. Celia stares out of her bedroom window.

Minny nods.

INT. FOOTE ESTATE - LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT MORNING

Celia and Minny sit at a card table holding playing cards.

Two additional hands lay face up on the table in front of two

empty chairs across from them.

hand.

She removes a card from Celia's and lays it down. She then

points to the hand next to Celia. Celia nods.

INT. JUNIOR LEAGUE - MEETING HALL - DAY

Hilly stands at her podium, tan and ready to lead. She holds

her gavel like a weapon.

Hilly stares right at Skeeter who sits alone in the back.

The women applaud and tap each other on their thighs.

Skeeter braces herself as hands pop up everywhere. Jolene

French stands.

Jolene looks back and snarls at Skeeter.

The room erupts.

Skeeter's ousting took less than ten seconds. Elizabeth

secretly turns to Skeeter from a few rows ahead.

EXT. PHELAN PLANTATION - FRONT PORCH - MORNING

shifting through the Miss Myrna letters.

Charlotte steps onto the porch.

Bridge is underway at the Leefolt house. Aibileen enters

holding a tray of coffee cups.

Elizabeth, Hilly, Jolene and several other girls giggle as

they kneel down behind furniture.

Elizabeth looks back. Her belly is huge.

There's a knock at door.

The girls giggle more loudly now. Celia peers into the

living room window.

The bridge tables are in plain view. Celia's face grows

pinker than her sweater.

Hilly's face hardens...

INT. FOOTE ESTATE - KITCHEN - DAY

Minny stands at the sink shelling peas. A distinct red cut

is perched above her swollen eye.

Celia sits at the kitchen table halfway through the pie.

Minny freezes, keeping her face on the peas.

Celia suddenly slaps her thigh with excitement.

Celia rises and smiles like she just cured cancer.

Celia gets some ice out of the fridge.

Celia places the ice in a towel and approaches Minny. She

looks at the cut above her eye.

Celia grabs Minny's hand. Minny pulls away.

Just then Johnny pulls up in the driveway. Celia and Minny

turn to the window, then spring into action.

INT. FOOTE ESTATE - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Minny sits crouched on the lid of the guest bath toilet as

Johnny chases Celia around the house. Celia giggles.

the toilet in the bathroom mirror.

She raises Celia's ice rag up to her swollen eye.

INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NEXT AFTERNOON

Skeeter enters quietly through Aibileen's kitchen door.

INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

As Minny wipes her nose with her sleeve, Skeeter approaches.

The women part, making way as Aibileen leads Skeeter to a

seat at the kitchen table.

PEARLY, 58, sits next to Skeeter and touches her arm.

Another WOMAN walks over.

Another woman speaks from the living room.

Women of all ages slowly rise up and nod their heads. Skeeter

looks around in awe.

INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Skeeter sits and writes as Pearly begins the interviews.

CORA, 70.

CALLIE, 60, takes off her glasses and wipes her eyes.

Skeeter closes her eyes for moment.

When she opens them she sees A VISION OF CONSTANTINE STANDING

BEFORE HER.

Constantine smiles and grabs Skeeter's hand. She presses her

thumb firmly in her palm. When Skeeter blinks again, the

vision is gone.

Standing in place of Constantine is GRETCHEN, 26.

Skeeter and the other maids are taken aback.

Aibileen crosses over to Gretchen.

INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Aibileen sits with Skeeter on the sofa reading and answering

Miss Myrna letters. Aibileen is dressed very nicely.

Several flower arrangements are placed around the room. An

unwrapped present rests on the coffee table.

As Skeeter writes this down, someone walks onto Aibileen's

front porch. Skeeter becomes worried. Aibileen looks to a

wall clock and smiles.

About a dozen letters and cards fall into a basket under the

mail slot.

Aibileen jumps up and starts sorting through the cards.

Aibileen stops on one card in particular. She sits back down

next to Skeeter.

Aibileen opens the card to find a twenty dollar bill inside

along with a picture of the Spears family. Aibileen reads

the card aloud.

Aibileen laughs and raises her hand to her mouth. Skeeter is

touched.

The doorbell rings. Aibileen jumps up and opens the door. A

delivery man greets her with two more vases of flowers.

Aibileen looks out to the street where a white woman gets out

of her car with a huge country ham. Two little girls in

matching dresses jump out behind her.

The woman sees Aibileen on the porch and waves. Aibileen

waves back and smiles.

Catching it all, the moment soon grows bittersweet for

Skeeter. She wipes her eye.

INT. PHELAN PLANTATION - SKEETER'S BEDROOM - 3 WEEKS LATER

Morning light shines into Skeeter's room. Stuart has

returned from the rig. Fully clothed, he and Skeeter sleep

on Skeeter's bed.

Charlotte shouts Skeeter's name from down the hall.

Skeeter's eyes pop open. She's groggy and hasn't fully

realized the company lying next to her.

Stuart throws his arm over Skeeter. Reality sinks in.

Skeeter rolls over to find Stuart, eyes shut, smiling.

When Stuart tries to get up, Skeeter flattens him reaches

down and pulls the covers up over his entire body.

Skeeter props up on her side and faces the door making sure

the covers hide that she's clothed.

Charlotte enters and heads straight for Skeeter's closet.

Charlotte pulls out a dress and lays it on the bed, right on

top of Stuart.

Charlotte spies a LARGE TOE sticking out of the covers. It

belongs to Stuart, but she assumes it's Skeeter's.

Charlotte exits and shuts the door.

Skeeter is mortified. Stuart sits up, grinning.

Stuart tries to kiss Skeeter. She resists.

Stuart embraces Skeeter and brings his lips close to hers.

They kiss.

EXT. STREET - DOWNTOWN JACKSON - DAY

A bank's clock shows twelve noon in downtown Jackson. It's

eerily quiet, not a soul on the street...

We hear archival footage of Walter Cronkite addressing the

nation.

INT. FOOTE ESTATE - LIVING ROOM - SAME DAY

Minny stands at the top of a tall step ladder vacuuming

Oscar's head.

Celia runs into the living room. Tears stream down her face.

Minny's eyes roll back in her head as she starts to faint.

She grabs on to Oscar's body and slides down to the floor.

EXT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - SAME DAY

Hilly sits with her son William playing on a blanket on the

front lawn.

A neighbor suddenly pulls up in his car stopping in front of

She then grabs William, pulls him in close as if he's somehow

in danger.

We hear Walter Cronkite's parting thoughts on JFK.

INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER THAT NIGHT

Minny, Skeeter and Aibileen sit quietly compiling stories.

Aibileen and Minny look up to Aibileen's framed picture of

John F. Kennedy.

Aibileen grows anxious. She suddenly jumps out of her chair

and paces around the kitchen.

Aibileen snaps.

Skeeter looks away..

Skeeter look to Minny.

INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE (FLASHBACK) - KITCHEN - 6 MONTHS EARLIER

We continue with the earlier flashback where Minny arrives at

Hilly's with her famed chocolate pie. Hilly leads Minny into

the kitchen, Missus Walters follows behind.

Hilly slices a big piece and grabs a fork. She leans against

the counter and takes a big bite.

Minny stands silent as Hilly finishes in three bites.

Hilly cuts another piece for herself.

Not expecting this, Minny leans away from Hilly.

Hilly takes an even bigger bite from the second slice.

Minny's eyes narrow over a forced smile.

Missus Walters grabs a plate and reaches for the pie.

Hilly slides the pie a little too fast down the counter

toward Minny. Minny stops it before it falls to the floor.

Hilly calmly sets her plate down on the counter.

Minny moves toward Hilly.

Minny nods smugly as she looks down at Hilly's slice.

Missus Walters immediately gets it. She bursts out laughing

so hard she has to lower herself to the floor.

Hilly starts to hyperventilate as everything sinks in.

As Minny leaves, Hilly runs to the sink and throws up.

INT. AIBILEEN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Aibileen and Skeeter are speechless.

Minny eyes narrow.

INT. HARPER ROW PUBLISHING/PANTRY (INTERCUT) - DAY

Miss Stein talks to Skeeter on the phone.

Skeeter nods with frustration.

INT. ROBERT E. LEE HOTEL - BALLROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

The African Children's Benefit Ball is well underway.

The energy and look of the two hundred attendees feel like a

throwback to the women's suffrage movement. Many older women

wear heavy long black skirts and jackets.

Hilly wears swathes of maroon-colored taffeta. Ruffles

clutch her throat. She stands next to Jolene French and a

WLBT CAMERAMAN.

Dressed to the nines, Jolene raises a microphone and looks

into the camera.

Three dozen servers stand in a line. Minny and Aibileen are

among them.

Tables are covered with items donated for the auction.

On the baked goods table, Minny's famed chocolate pie

promises to again be a big money maker.

Celia and Johnny enter the ballroom. Celia wears a hideous,

pink and silver sequined gown. As usual, Celia's breasts

command attention.

The room locks on Celia as specks of light bounce off her

dress and jiggle across the ceiling.

A TITILLATED OLD HUSBAND tips his martini onto his wife's

shoe.

Other wives dig fingernails into husbands' arms. The man's

wife responds louder.

Celia downs a glass of champagne and leans into Johnny.

Minny pulls Aibileen aside and points to Celia.

Celia grabs more champagne from a passing server.

Celia catches eyes with Minny. She smiles and nods quickly

and then looks away, careful not to tip off Johnny of their

relationship.

Skeeter enters with Stuart. She wears a long-sleeved black

velvet dress and her hair is being somewhat cooperative.

Missus Walters enters wearing a floor-length blue beaded

gown, circa 1943. A white orchid wilts at her clavicle.

INT. ROBERT E. LEE HOTEL - BALLROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

Celia approaches Elizabeth and Jolene who talk next to a

punch bowl. Celia is now drinking some kind of pink drink

with an umbrella sticking out of it.

Elizabeth's homemade maternity ball gown resembles a velvet

potato sack cinched with red ribbon.

Jolene reaches out an pats Celia's shoulder.

Elizabeth pulls Jolene away. Celia downs her drink.

The guests are now seated at twenty-eight round tables.

Scores of black servers dressed in tuxedos ferry plates.

Hilly makes her way to the podium.

The room claps enthusiastically.

Hilly mechanically gestures toward the servers in the room.

Skeeter shakes her head as the less inspired applause dies

down. Celia waves to Minny and jumps out of her chair.

Johnny grabs Celia by the arm and pulls her back down. Celia

reaches for Johnny's glass of wine.

INT. ROBERT E. LEE HOTEL - LATER THAT EVENING

As Celia looks at the prize table's bids, Johnny and Stuart

lean against a bar chatting with a few other bored men.

Hilly suddenly slides next to Johnny completely ignoring

Stuart.

Hilly squeezes the crook of his arm.

Johnny looks away.

Johnny walks away leaving Hilly no choice but to acknowledge

Stuart. She and Stuart never look each other's way.

Hilly walks away as Jolene approaches the podium.

INT. ROBERT E. LEE HOTEL - BALLROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Jolene finishes up the winners list.

Jolene flips a page.

The room erupts in applause. Hilly now sits at a table with

her family, Missus Walters, and the Leefolts.

Skeeter and Stuart sit at a table full of elderly people they

don't know.

Minny clears dishes nearby. Hearing her name, she becomes

very alert.

Minny turns to find Hilly smiling at her tightly.

Celia rushes up behind Hilly, her voice slurred.

Hilly remains calm. Celia grabs Hilly's long sleeve.

Hilly stands up and pulls away. A ripping sound cuts through

the air.

Celia stares at Hilly's torn cuff in her hands.

Jolene announces another round of winners loudly over the

microphone, forcing Celia to raise her voice.

Jolene loses her place on the list. The room grows quiet but

Celia is still yelling.

The room echoes with Celia's words. Across the room, women's

noses wrinkle.

Stuart belts out with a laugh. Skeeter pinches his arm.

Celia is mortified. Sweat beads on her forehead.

Celia starts to breathe heavily. Her eyes start to water.

Horrified, Skeeter catches eyes with Minny and Aibileen.

They all immediately look away.

Johnny makes his way over. Celia holds her breath, shaking

her head back and forth.

Celia leans over and vomits on the fleur-de-lis print carpet.

The entire room gasps in horror.

Johnny tries to pull Celia back. She pushes Johnny away and

runs for the bathroom. He follows.

Hilly marches over to Aibileen who is standing nearby.

INT. ROBERT E. LEE HOTEL - KITCHEN - LATER THAT NIGHT

Minny's daughter, Sugar, stands over a large commercial sink

filled with sudsy water, washing dishes.

other young girls.

As the girls all laugh, Minny pops Sugar hard on the back of

her head.

Minny storms off.

cab.

Celia pulls the covers off her head and sits up a little.

Celia pulls a letter out from under the covers.

Celia sobs.

INT. FOOTE ESTATE - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

The manuscript sits before Aibileen, Minny and Skeeter.

Aibileen looks at Skeeter.

INT. PHELAN PLANTATION - BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

Red-eyed, Skeeter enters Charlotte's room. A bowl rests on

the bedside table with a wet rag draped over the side.

Charlotte is wig free and terribly thin. Her collarbone

protrudes long and narrow, but her eyes are as sharp as ever.

INT. PHELAN PLANTATION (FLASHBACK) LIVING ROOM - DAY

Charlotte, much healthier, scurries around the house

adjusting flower arrangements and straightening pictures.

A guest unnecessarily grabs a table for balance, making a

point about the damp floor...

INT. PHELAN PLANTATION (FLASHBACK) DINING ROOM - DAY

Charlotte sits with twelve women at the dining table as

Constantine pushes the casserole cart around and begins

serving lunch.

As the guests sip coffee, each woman grimaces and turns to

Charlotte.

Charlotte shoots Constantine a look. Constantine nods

sorrowfully. She picks up a woman's plate and begins filling

it with food from the cart very slowly.

Constantine strains to lower the plate in front of the woman.

Her hands tremble.

The plate tilts causing peas to pour into the woman's lap.

With that, Charlotte stands up and slaps the table with her

hand.

Constantine slowly looks to Charlotte. Totally exhausted,

she grips the casserole cart with both hands to steady

herself.

Constantine wets herself.

Slowly the women begin realizing what's happening. The two

women closest to Constantine gasp and quickly move away from

her.

Another woman rises from the table covering her mouth with a

napkin and leaves the room.

Just now realizing what has happened, Constantine looks down

at her soiled dress. No one says a word. No one comes to

Constantine's aid.

Constantine looks to Charlotte.

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD (FLASHBACK) - MOMENTS LATER

Constantine hobbles with a cane down a gravel road still

wearing her soiled dress. She turns and looks one last time

at the Phelan Plantation...

INT. PHELAN PLANTATION - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Skeeter trembles. Charlotte won't look at her.

Charlotte starts to cry. Skeeter isn't affected.

Charlotte gets defensive.

hand.

blue. A white peace dove spreads its wing under the title.

INT. MINNY'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Minny stands over the stove frying chicken as Sugar enters

ERNESTINE, pours a cup of coffee with her right hand.

have gotten slim.

Hilly leans over and taps her television.

Aibileen jerks her head toward the television.

INT. FOOTE ESTATE - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

Minny watches transfixed as she and Celia eat dessert in

front of the television.

The host starts laughing. Jolene snaps.

Smoke rises from the shirt Aibileen is ironing. She snaps to

attention, pulls the iron off the burned shirt.

FOOTE LIVING ROOM

Minny walks like a zombie over to Celia and gathers her dirty

plate, never taking her eyes off the television.

Poof! Jolene disappears by way of a Seal-Lily ice cream

commercial.

chest.

She slides down to her pillow and stares at the ceiling.

EXT. PHELAN PLANTATION - PORCH - DUSK

Skeeter sits on the swing with Stuart who's just arrived from

the rig, still wearing his dingy work clothes.

and places it in Skeeter's lap.

A huge diamond is surrounded by twelve small sapphires.

INT. PHELAN PLANTATION - BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

hears a door closing outside.

Charlotte's smile fades. Skeeter prepares for the worst.

Skeeter stands to walk away.

Skeeter sits back down...

Charlotte starts coughing. Skeeter hands her a tissue.

Charlotte slaps her palms as if throwing the cancer away.

Charlotte raises Skeeter's ring finger.

Skeeter laughs and hugs her mother. Robert never stirs.

EXT. GROCERY STORE - PARKING LOT - DAY

Hilly drives in front of Jitney Jingle grocery store. She

wears a scarf on her head and big sunglasses. One-armed

Ernestine rides in the passenger seat.

hurriedly waves Ernestine out of the car.

One-Arm Ernestine races to the storefront and removes

William's campaign poster taped to the window.

INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

Hilly reads the book in bed. William is fast asleep.

Suddenly, her eyes widen, her breath becomes heavy. She

slowly turns a page and freezes. Her face turns white.

louder than humanly possible.

THE SCREAM CONTINUES OVER:

INT. SKEETER'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

Skeeter lies in bed sleeping. Her eyes pop open.

INT. AIBILEEN'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

Aibileen lies in bed sleeping. Her eyes pop open.

INT. MINNY'S BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING

Minny lies in bed sleeping. Her eyes pop open. But, this

time, Hilly's scream fades as knocks at the door grow louder.

Knocking that has actually stirred Minny awake.

Minny covers the girls with a blanket. She puts on a robe and

grabs a bat from behind the door.

INT. MINNY'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Minny approaches the door.

Minny slowly opens the door. Johnny is all smiles.

As Johnny enters, Minny raises the bat and swings. Johnny

hands in front of her.

place.

Aibileen nervously pours coffee.

Aibileen begins pouring coffee into Hilly's cup.

A sudden realization washes over Jolene.

Aibileen spills a few drops of coffee on Hilly's plate. Hilly

looks up to Aibileen slow and deliberate.

Aibileen takes the cloth from the coffee pitcher handle and

dabs the spilled coffee.

Aibileen glances at Hilly. A secret burns between them.

stand at once. The congregation begins to clap.

Minny and Aibileen look around trying to figure out the

source of adulation. They both start clapping too.

Aibileen steps up to a woman in the last pew.

The woman laughs.

The woman raises a copy of "The Help." Aibileen notices a

copy of the book in each member's hand.

Aibileen looks to Minny, realizing she's in on it.

The Reverend then hands her a box wrapped in white paper,

tied with a blue ribbon.

time since knowing each other.

Skeeter nods.

EXT. PHELAN PLANTATION - NIGHT

Skeeter stands next to the barn smoking a cigarette reading

the Harper and Row offer for the hundredth time.

Tires crunch gravel down the drive. Skeeter sees a car

moving toward her with the headlights off.

Worried, Skeeter looks toward her home. Charlotte can be

seen in an upstairs window.

Skeeter soon recognizes the car as Hilly's.

Hilly parks, lights a cigarette and gets out of her car.

Skeeter charges toward her.

Hilly screams and throws her lit cigarette at Skeeter.

Hilly's a mess. Her shirt is half tucked. Her shorts strain

to contain a newly developed layer of fat.

A horrible fever blister burns hot on Hilly's upper lip.

Hilly storms up the porch steps. Skeeter follows.

Skeeter yanks Hilly's arm hard.

Skeeter can't help but laugh.

Hilly opens the door. Skeeter grabs her. They struggle.

Charlotte suddenly appears. Skeeter lets go of Hilly.

Hilly is shocked by Charlotte's frail appearance.

Hilly self-consciously licks her fever blister.

Charlotte peers closely at Hilly's cold sore.

Hilly's face turns purple with embarrassment. Charlotte

moves in for the kill.

Hilly looks back and forth between Skeeter and her mother,

not knowing what to say.

Hilly runs out of the house as Charlotte sashays quietly into

the living room.

Shocked, Skeeter stands alone in the foyer. Hilly sprays

gravel across the Phelan yard as she speeds away.

Skeeter gulps as she heads toward the living room.

INT. PHELAN PLANTATION - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Charlotte pats the sofa as Skeeter enters and sits.

Skeeter lets out a big sigh of relief.

trembles as she signs the book, never having guessed how good

it would feel.

answers. Minny screams on the other end of the line.

INT. LEEFOLT HOME - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Aibileen enters to find Elizabeth and Hilly staring at her.

Elizabeth is two weeks WAY PAST DUE.

Hilly licks her cold sore as she steps forward. She glides

her hand across the L-shaped crack in the Elizabeth's table,

drawing Aibileen's attention to it.

Aibileen turns to Elizabeth.

Elizabeth won't look at Aibileen.

Elizabeth whispers to Hilly.

Mae Mobley enters the room.

Mae Mobley coughs.

Elizabeth looks to Hilly, appearing somewhat upset with this

suggestion.

Hilly glares at Aibileen as Elizabeth runs down the hall.

Mae Mobley becomes scared and hides behind Aibileen's leg.

Aibileen shouts, interrupting Hilly.

Hilly narrows her eyes.

Fear floods into Hilly's eyes.

Aibileen kneels down as Elizabeth returns with the syrup.

Aibileen squeezes Mae Mobley for the last time. They both

cry together. Hilly speaks up.

Aibileen rises up from Mae Mobley and turns to Elizabeth.

Elizabeth avoids eye contact. Aibileen turns and walks away.

As Elizabeth leans down to pick up Mae Mobley....HER WATER

BREAKS. She glares at Hilly with shock and regret.

EXT. LEEFOLT HOME - MOMENTS LATER

Aibileen steps out of the house with her purse.

She walks stoically down the driveway. Tears stream down her

face.

Mae Mobley runs to the living room window crying. She beats

on the glass from inside.

Aibileen never turns.

INT. HOLBROOK HOUSE - FOYER - DAY

Hilly, even fatter now, sifts through the day's mail.

She comes across a piece from Celia Foote addressed to The

to: TWO-SLICE HILLY!

INT. AIBILEEN'S HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

Aibileen sits at her kitchen table, typing on Skeeter's old

typewriter. We watch as keys write out the rest of

places it behind two hundred other typed out pages.

She looks up to the framed picture of Treelore and rises from

the table with pride.

INT. HARPER AND ROW - SKEETER'S OFFICE - NEW YORK - DAY

Skeeter smiles as she reads from a book in her corner office.

The Manhattan skyline rises behind her. She wears Pucci.

Her hair is perfectly styled. She looks gorgeous.

The book's cover reads:

Next to the book is a glass box. Constantine's corn pipe

rests inside.

AIBILEEN'S NEW HOME - LIVING ROOM - FIFTEEN YEARS LATER

Aibileen, 70, rises from a sofa. Her hair is gray. Reading

glasses hang on a chain from around her neck.

As she begins a slow walk down the hall, we see the

surroundings of her new home for the first time. It's much

bigger, well furnished and beautiful.

She passes a study lined with shelves of books. A copy of

"The Help" and "All My Babies" are placed side by side.

At the end of the hall, Aibileen approaches the opened door

of a brightly lit, sparkling white, bathroom.

She enters the bathroom and closes the door.
