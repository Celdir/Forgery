EXT. TEXAS SCRUB -- DAY

Two men in shorts and Hawaiian shirts are poking around a

sandy section in the middle of scrub flats. SERGEANT CLIFF

POTTS is in the f.g., a plant-and-tree guidebook in hand, as

SERGEANT "MIKEY" HOGAN works a metal detector over a large,

sandy bank in the b.g.  Both are Army career men with a

morning off to pursue their hobbies.

Mikey bends to scoop something out of the sand, putting it

in a canvas bag slung on his hip.

MIKEY sees that Cliff is talking, pulls his headset off.

CU MIKEY

MIKEY in the f.g. now, looking down at something as he pulls

his headset off again--

Cliff wearily turns and approaches from the b.g.

He stops by Mikey and looks down, his expression changing

GROUND -- CU BONES

Sticking out from the sand bank are the SKELETAL BONES of a

MAN'S HAND.  There is a ring on one finger.

EXT. ROAD -- DAY

A distant cloud of DUST appears on the horizon MUSIC

underscores that we are in Texas, and we SUPERIMPOSE the

OPENING CREDITS as the dust takes form around an APPROACHING

CAR.  The car comes close enough to see it has a County

Sheriff's insignia on the side.

INT. CAR

We see SAM DEEDS, the Sheriff, driving. Sam is 40, quietly

competent to the point of seeming a bit moody. He sees

something up ahead.

MUSIC, CREDITS END as Sam pulls off the road and we see the

sergeants standing in the scrub.

EXT. SCRUB -- DAY -- BONES

The hand and forearm down to the elbow of the skeleton are

visible now.

WIDER

Cliff stands looking at the arm with Sam. MIKEY is a few

yards behind them, playing with his metal detector. Beyond

him we see the Sheriff's car parked.

Mikey has come up to them, still sweeping with the metal

detector.

Sam just nods. Mikey frowns, goes down on one knee and

scratches something out of the dirt at their feet--

Mikey comes up with something, holds it before them. An

encrusted piece of metal--

Sam takes the thing, lays it back down where Mikey found it.

Sam frowns down at the piece of metal as he rubs the face of

it.

CU METAL

Sam's thumb wipes across the face of the encrusted metal. It

is roughly star-shaped.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM -- DAY -- TEXAS MAP

We look at a beautiful old pull-down map of Texas.

A teacher in her late 30s, PILAR CRUZ, steps in front of the

map and we FOLLOW her across the room, carrying a poster

Posters hung on the walls beyond her show luminaries from

Texas history-- Sam Houston, Stephen Austin, Juan Seguin. A

new parent, CELIE PAYNE, stands in the middle of the otherwise

empty classroom.

PILAR starts to put the poster up. CELIE moves to hold it in

place for her.

She steps back to see if the poster, an old photo of Geronimo,

looks straight. Another teacher, MOLLY sticks her head in

the door--

EXT. STREET -- DAY -- CU VAQUERO PICTURE

On the door of a deluxe pickup truck is an airbrushed picture

of a Pancho Villa-looking vaquero with bandoliers crossing

his chest and a gun blazing in each hand. We hear LOUD MUSIC--

WIDER

A small group of teenage Chicano BOYS hang around the truck

in the bed, on the hood, leaning against it. A BOOMBOX placed

on top of the cab blasts RANCHA MUSIC out at the neighborhood.

Somebody's legs are hanging out the open passenger-side door.

The kids suddenly look as a Sheriff's Department car slides

into the f.g.  A Deputy Sheriff, TRAVIS, gets out.

KIDS

Trying to look tough and unworried as we TRACK across the

street toward them. Travis's hand reaches out from behind

the camera to flick the MUSIC OFF.

INT. PICKUP

AMADO CRUZ, Pilar's 15-year-old son, lies on the front seat

installing a compact disc player into the dash slot. He

reaches up to the dash, can't find what he wants.

He looks up and we TILT to see Travis leaning in the window,

examining the new radio

INT. CAFE SANTA BARBARA -- AFTERNOON -- ENRIQUE

Sweat beads the forehead of a thin, tired-looking recent

immigrant, ENRIQUE, as he delivers platters of chile rellenos

to a booth. MEXICAN MUSIC plays on a jukebox in the b.g. We

HOLD on the booth, where HOLLIS POGUE, in his 60s entertains

two GOOD OLD BOYS--

The breakfast companions are laughing already--

More laughter--

We WIDEN to see Sam standing by their booth. No telling how

long he's been listening, Fenton is embarrassed.

We sense a little strain when Sam has to talk about his father--

Sam looks to the register where Pilar's mother, MERCEDES

CRUZ, whacks rolls of change apart on the counter. She seems

to be avoiding looking toward him.

Something about the way Sam says it puts Hollis on guard.

CU HOLLIS

Hollis is hooked into it now--

He looks down at the table--

We PAN down to the table, The food has changed. The tortillas

are in a straw basket instead of plastic. The jukebox changes

to ANOTHER SONG and the LIGHT DIMS slightly. A hand with a

big Masonic ring on one finger appears to lift a tortilla--

underneath it lie three ten-dollar bills.  The hand lifts

them up and we TILT to see the face of SHERIFF CHARLEY WADE,

a big, mean redneck with shrewd eyes. It is 1957--

WIDER

Wade sits across from his young deputies, YOUNG HOLLIS (30s)

and BUDDY DEEDS (20s). A chicken-fried steak sits untouched

in front of Buddy. Hollis has the anxious look of an errand

boy, while Buddy is self-contained and quietly forceful for

his age.

Wade folds the money and stuffs if in his pocket--

Wade and Hollis slide out of the booth to stand.

Hollis stops a few feet away, shocked. Wade just stares down

at Buddy.

Buddy looks Wade in the eye, seemingly unafraid.

The CUSTOMERS are all watching now, nervous. Buddy thinks

for a moment, not taking his eyes off Wade.

Wade rests his hand on his pistol.  It is dead silent but

for the MUSIC on the box.

Buddy has his gun out under the table.  He slowly brings it

up and lays it flat on the table, not taking his hand off it

or his eyes off Wade.

Wade feels the people around him waiting for a reaction.  He

leans close to Buddy to croak in a hoarse whisper.

He turns and nearly bumps into Hollis. He gives the Deputy a

shove.

CU BUDDY

He watches till the screen door shuts behind them, then

holsters his gun and begins to saw at the steak as if nothing

had happened. He calls softly--

He looks up at somebody and we PAN till we see Sam, still

standing over the booth, listening. We are back in 1995--

We PULL BACK to see Hollis and his buddies at the table,

eating their lunches as they listen.

Hollis sees what Sam is getting at, grins--

Sam nods, speaks softly--

EXT. ARMY INSTALLATION -- DAY -- CU DEL PAYNE

COLONEL DELMORE PAYNE (DEL), a very direct, by-the-book Black

officer, addresses them. Artillery pieces angle toward the

sky behind him--

OFFICERS Cliff and Mikey, in uniform now, flank SERGEANT

PRISCILLA WORTH, a Black woman in her early 40s, as they

stand in formation--

REVERSE

We look over the shoulders of assembled OFFICERS and NCOs

toward Del.

CU DEL

INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE -- AFTERNOON -- BUDDY PHOTO

We are looking through a magnifying glass at an old photo.

Buddy's face is slightly distorted by the glass.

Sam sits at his desk in the Sheriff's office, looking down

at the photo--

CU PHOTOGRAPH

An old photo of the 1957 Sheriff's Department officers on

the courthouse steps. Wade, Hollis, Buddy, a few others, all

in uniform.

Sam puts a magnifying glass over the photo and bends close

to look.

EXTREME CU PHOTO -- BADGE

MAGNIFIED POV of the badge on Wade's chest swims into view.

A metal star. We hear the secretary getting rid of the caller.

CU SAM

Looking at the photo, troubled--

EXT. BIG O'S ROADHOUSE -- NIGHT -- NEON SIGN

We start on a BLINKING SIGN--BIG O'S, then PAN to see a full

parking lot outside the low, neon-lit roadhouse. R&B MUSIC

blasts from inside.

EXT. DOORWAY -- CHET

CHET, a Black kid around 15, stands nervously at the door

building up his courage.  He takes a deep breath, plunges

in.

INT. BIG O'S

We TRACK with Chet, very nervous, as he makes his way through

the crowded roadhouse. The customers are all Black, many

from the nearby Army post, SHOUTING and LAUGHING over the

loud MUSIC. Chet, edgy, is looking for somebody.  He sees...

CHET'S POV -- OTIS

Seen through the crush is OTIS "BIG O" PAYNE, a large man in

his early 60s, laughing as he stands behind the bar.

CHET

He nervously puts his hand under his jacket. A gun? He pushes

forward to get a better view.

CHET'S POV -- OTIS

Moving in on him. Otis looks over, sees the boy, frowns--

CHET

Reaching under his jacket, he pulls out--a photograph. He

looks at it--suddenly there is a SCREAM from behind, then

GUNSHOTS, patrons diving for the floor.

Chet whirls around and we WHIP PAN to see a young man, SHADOW,

emptying his pistol into RICHIE, a young soldier, as a young

woman, ATHENA, screams and tries to pull the gun away. With

the last shot, Shadow turns and heads for the door, but is

tackled and swarmed by angry men, SHOUTING.

We PAN to Athena, kneeling over the bleeding, twitching body

of Richie--

CHET

Chet backs up, horrified. A large hand grasps him on the

shoulder from behind. He turns to see Otis standing over

him, strangely calm amid the chaos

Chet hurries away.  Otis watches him for a moment, then turns

to the mess in his club.

INT. AUDITORIUM -- NIGHT -- CU ANGLO MOTHER

An angry woman stands from her auditorium chair--

We WHIP PAN to see another standing parent--

We WHIP PAN to a man in the rear--

WIDER

We are in the High School auditorium, a hot-and-heavy teachers-

and-parents meeting in progress. Pilar sits at the end of a

long table facing the agitated parents, taking some heat.

DANNY PADILLA, a young, long-haired reporter, sits in the

front taking notes, enjoying the show.

REAR OF AUDITORIUM

PALOMA CRUZ, Pilar's teenage daughter, peeks into the room,

then moves down the side toward the stage.

Pilar is trying to stay calm despite her anger.

REVERSE

We shoot past Pilar toward the parents in their seats. PALOMA

steps up to whisper to her.

Pilar looks troubled by what she's heard. She shoots a look

toward the others at the table, then slips away with Paloma--

CU PRINCIPAL

Weary--

GROANS from the parents--

INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE -- NIGHT -- SHADOW

Shadow, face bruised, hands cuffed behind him, is pushed in

through the door to be booked.

Sam steps in behind him and meets his Chief Deputy RAY

HERNANDEZ, coming from the other direction.

As Ray steps out, Pilar looking distraught, walks into the

station, passing right by Sam without seeing him.

CU SAM

Wonders what she's doing there--

SAM'S POV -- PILAR

She stands by an unoccupied reception desk, very upset, unable

to attract anyone's attention because of the activity around

the shooting.  She looks tired and a bit scared under the

harsh overhead light.

PILAR AND SAM

Pilar looks around. Sam is standing by her. We can tell there

is some history between these two.

He starts away, stops, comes back--

Pilar watches Sam go--

REAR OF OFFICE

Travis sits typing away at a word processor as Athena, in

tears, gives testimony.

We WIDEN to see Sam standing over the desk--

Travis looks at his booking sheets--

INT. JAIL HALLWAY

Sam walks with Amado, who is trying to look defiant--

Nothin--

Still nothing--

Amado just gives him a look--

INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE

Sam and AMADO step out into the office, where Pilar stands

waiting.

Pilar yanks AMADO outside by his arm. She turns to shoot a

look back at Sam, then steps out through the glass door.

CU SAM

Watching her go--

EXT. OBSTACLE COURSE -- MORNING -- PIT

We shoot up from a pit in the ground. WHUMP! WHUMP! WHUMP!

Three men leap over, landing on the far side and running

away from us.

MEN

Del Payne runs with Cliff and Mikey on a pathway along a

security fence, the two sergeants struggling to keep up,

occasionally vaulting or scaling some mild obstacle.

Del notices bow hard they are breathing--

Del accelerates and we HOLD with the sergeants, slowing to a

near-walk.

INT. FORENSICS LAB -- VARIOUS SHOTS

We hear Hank Williams' gospel song "I'll Have a New Body

(I'll Have a New Life)" as we see the gathered bones of the

skeleton tagged and photographed and measured, impressions

made of the dental work in the skull, photographs of the

excavation of the body at various stages marked with red

grease pencil, the piece of metal laid in a de-tarnishing

dish, the ring put under a microscope.

CU METAL

MUSIC CONTINUES as we TIGHTEN on the piece of metal, a pair

of tongs pulling it from the de-tarnishing solution. It is a

star-shaped badge, bearing the words "SHERIFF--RIO COUNTY."

INT. COUNTRY AND WESTERN BAR -- AFTERNOON

C&W MUSIC playing, the regulars starting to show up. Sam

makes his way to a table where BEN WETZEL, a Texas Ranger,

sits with a file of forensic reports.

They shake, Sam sits.

Sam looks at the folder of reports.

Ben smiles, closes the folder--

They sit in awkward silence for a moment. Ben feels bad about

it.

INT. CLASSROOM -- DAY

Pilar stands at the blackboard by her outline of 19th century

Texas history.

CU DRAWING

Somebody making a skillful pencil drawing on the corner of a

sheet of lined notebook paper. A bald, muscular shotputter

after releasing the shot, his hand large in the f.g.

CHET

Drawing intently. He takes the notebook and lays his thumb

over the corner.

NOTEBOOK

Chet "flips" the corner of the notebook and the series of

drawings he's made form a brief cartoon of the shot-putter

blowing his cheeks out and heaving the shot right past us.

Extremely well-drawn--

PILAR

Looking out at the class--

CHET

Startled, he hides the notebook under his hands --

EXT. LAKE -- DAY -- CU FISHING LURE

A nasty-looking thing. Only a bass would want to eat this.

Hollis leans in to peer at the thing dangling before his

face.

WIDER

Hollis sits in the swivel chair of a bass boat tied to a

dock at the lake, going through his box of lures. Sam appears

on the dock and steps down.

Hollis squints at a rubber lure, rejects it--

Hollis reacts. Sam puts a foot on the gunwale of the boat.

Hollis makes a great show of considering--

This is a low blow, but accurate enough to shake Sam.

Hollis holds up a double handful of lures--dozens of rubber

and plastic worms and shiners and frogs and spinners--

He gives Sam a look--

INT. CLASSROOM -- ARMY BASE -- DAY -- CU ATHENA

Athena stands at attention, trying to keep her composure--

WIDER

Cliff leans against a desk, a blackboard covered with radar

diagrams behind him. Priscilla sits nearby, both of them

focused on Athena.

A silence as the sergeant lets her stew for a moment. She

works up her courage--

Cliff considers for a long moment--

Athena steps out of the room. Cliff sits on the desk--

Crossing to the door--

EXT. BLEDSOE HOUSE -- DAY -- ROCKER

We start on a CU of a rocker creaking back and forth on an

old wooden porch. A WOMAN HUMS.

MINNIE

MINNIE BLEDSOE, in her 60s, sits on her porch in the old

Black section of town, playing with a Gameboy. She has very

thick glasses on. Sam walks up to her from his car--

Minnie thinks, puts down the Gameboy--

We TRACK in to a close-up of her. R&B MUSIC FADES UP slowly--

INT. ROADHOUSE --

The joint is crowded, people drinking, talking, laughing, a

few dancing, all trying to avoid locking eyes with Sheriff

Wade, who sits with his legs stretched out at a table.

Young Hollis sits by him, smiling uncomfortably. Sax-wailing

R&B blasts from the jukebox. YOUNG OTIS, a slick, confident

character with straightened hair and a silk shirt on, in his

early 20s, stops to talk with a MAN on his way to bring a

tray with a couple beers and glasses over.

CU WADE

Watching Young Otis with narrowed eyes--

CU WADE'S POV -- OTIS

A man puts a slip of paper in Otis's pocket, pats his back.

Otis winks to acknowledge the bet, turns, makes eyes at a

PRETTY WOMAN sitting at the bar, who is eyeing him back.  He

lays the beers and glasses on the table, starts away.

OTIS TURNS, CUPS HIS HAND AROUND HIS EAR-

Expressionless, he starts to pour the beer into Wade's glass.

The Sheriff looks up into his face--

Otis feels people watching.  He doesn't want to lose face--

A very insolent answer for the time and place--

The beer is poured. Otis starts away--

Otis meets Wade's look now, pours the other beer--

No response. Wade deliberately pushes the glass away so beer

splashes on the table and drips into Hollis's lap--

Half the people in the room are watching now, the other half

moving away to relative safety. Otis tries to keep a lid on

his temper, looks around the room--

Wade stands, steely-eyed, and looks at Otis nose to nose--

Otis is starting to shake, but holds his ground--

He starts to turn away then WHAP! brings the butt of his

pistol up under Otis's chin, knocking him to the floor. A

woman SCREAMS and Otis, enraged, grabs the chair he has fallen

over, starts to get up--but Wade has the pistol levelled at

his face--

RODERICK is out on the floor now, hands held out in a gesture

of peace, as YOUNG MINNIE watches from behind the bar,

petrified--

Otis eases the chair down but doesn't say anything--

Wade looks around, widens his eyes in mock surprise--

A few people start for the exit.  Wade swivels and BLAM sends

a bullet past Minnie that shatters a crystal decanter behind

the bar.  People run for the door. Wade squats down to look

Otis in the face--

CU WADE

He stands and we FOLLOW him toward the bar--

The camera passes Wade and instead of Minnie there stands

Otis, PRESENT DAY, reminiscing. We are back in '95--

We SHIFT to see Sam sitting where Wade was headed--

Otis smiles, chooses his words carefully--

Otis smiles, looks away to ponder his response--

INT. CAR -- LATE AFTERNOON

Pilar drives Amado and her daughter Paloma home--

We see on PILAR's face that he has scored--

PILAR eases the car down San Jacinto street, seeing something

on the street and she's tuning her kids' conversation out--

PILAR'S POV -- SAM

Sam walks on the sidewalk parallel to them, talking with

three other MEN--

INT. PILAR'S CAR

Pilar is still looking fixedly out the window--

EXT. SAN JACINTO STREET -- LATE AFTERNOON

Danny Padilla is arguing with H.L. BRIGGS, a construction

company big shot, and JORGE GUERRA, a Council member in his

40s and Sam, as they walk down the sidewalk of the main street--

They all look at Sam, who has been listening patiently the

whole while.  They've reached his office.

Sam steps into his office, leaving H.L. shaking his head--

INT. HALLWAY -- DEL'S HOUSE -- LATE AFTERNOON

We TRACK down a hallway as Celie walks toward us, calling

ahead. Chet stands in the middle of the hall behind her.

CELIE passes us and Del crosses back in the other direction

from behind the camera, carrying boxes of their belongings.

We continue our SLOW TRACK forward--

Del disappears into the bedroom at the end of the hall--

DEL comes back out, empty-handed--

Del steps away past us, leaving Chet, defeated--

INT. CAFE -- NIGHT -- ENRIQUE

We start on Enrique, talking surreptitiously on the pay phone

on the way to the kitchen.

Mercedes bustles by, snapping her fingers--

We FOLLOW Mercedes back into the kitchen, where she moves

through, kibbitzing the operation--

WAITRESS

Mercedes stops by a young girl prepping a pork loin to be

cooked. She isn't wearing gloves.

She continues past, shaking her bead, bringing us to Pilar,

who is trying to stay out of the way--

Pilar gives up on the trip. She watches her mother poking at

the plates of chips and salsa ready to go out--

Mercedes just glares at her--

The employees are staring. Mercedes won't look at her daughter

as she steps out of the kitchen, banging into Enrique on his

way back in--

Mercedes is gone. The young girl, pulling plastic gloves on,

looks to Pilar.

The girl puts her hand on her heart in sympathy--

INT. COUNTRY AND WESTERN BAR -- NIGHT

A crowded room, C&W MUSIC plays on the box. Sam sits behind

a bottle of beer as the bartender, CODY, in his early 50s

philosophizes.

Sam swivels to look where Cody points--

SAM'S POV -- CORNER BOOTH

Cliff and Priscilla talk across a table--

SAM AND CODY

BOOTH -- CLIFF AND PRISCILLA

Things are obviously more than professional between these

two--

They look up to see Sam standing over them--

EXT. CAFE -- NIGHT

Enrique steps out of the darkened cafe, followed by Mercedes,

who locks up. Mercedes steps over to an expensive-looking

car--

EXT. BIG O'S ROADHOUSE -- DAY -- CU DEL

Del, in uniform, approaches the front door of Big O's, not

open for business yet. We TIGHTEN as he stops to read a

handlettered sign next to it: "BLACK SEMINOLE EXHIBIT REAR

ENTRANCE." He steps in--

INT. ROADHOUSE

Late-50s R&B plays on the JUKEBOX. Otis stands behind the

counter hooking the beer taps up. Del steps in and sits on a

stool at the far end of the bar, tense, looking around the

place. When Otis sees him, he stops dead. They lock eyes for

a moment, then Otis turns to call.

CAROLYN

CAROLYN SYKES, an attractive woman maybe ten years younger

than Otis, pulls the plug from the jukebox near where she's

scrubbing bloodstains off the floor. She turns to look at

the newcomer--

BAR

Del doesn't move to come closer--

Del nods toward where Carolyn is mopping--

Carolyn has come over by Otis, lugging the bucket and mop--

Carolyn nods, shoots a look to Otis--

They wail till she is gone to start again--

Otis pulls a tap back and it coughs before squirting beer.

Del looks away, not wanting to believe this--

Del gives him a dark look and lets the statement hang between

them. He gets up and heads for the door--

EXT. SAN JACINTO STREET -- DAY

Sam walks down the main street of town. A CROWD is gathering

at the other end for the ceremony--

We WIDEN as H.L. and Jorge catch up to him. H.L. slaps Sam

on the back--

Sam and the others smile as they reach the CROWD of

townspeople, mostly small business owners and retired people.

Photographers from the paper and a local TV news crew wait

by a veiled Statue roped off in a little traffic island.

Mercedes, dressed to kill, stands waiting next to Hollis

with a huge pair of scissors in her hand.

CU MERCEDES

Slowly working the blades of the scissors, she looks coldly

at Sam--

CU SAM

He nods to her as the crowd opens a path for him.

INT. MIKEY'S WORKSHOP -- MORNING

We start on a two-foot-high statue of a cowboy made from old

bullets and shell casings. We PAN past a few others, the

poses lifted from Frederic Remington paintings, till we see

Mikey, gluing together a work in progress, a Remington book

propped open in front of him. Cliff sits at the worktable

playing absently with the old bullets spilled out from MIKEY'S

bag

Cliff picks up a slug--

MIKEY holds the slug in front of his face--

EXT. SAN JACINTO STREET -- DAY

Hollis is finishing his oration, having put the crowd in a

good mood.

Applause--

SAM

Watching the crowd--

SAM'S POV

We PAN with his gaze across smiling faces, till he comes to

Danny and a couple of Chicano friends, looking grim. We RACK

FOCUS beyond them to see Pilar, watching the ceremony from a

few yards back--

HOLLIS

SAM

Not thrilled to be called on. He steps forward reluctantly

to APPLAUSE--

He looks to Hollis--

LAUGHTER. Sam holds Hollis's eyes for a moment before

continuing--

PILAR

Watching--

SAM

More LAUGHTER--

APPLAUSE--

Sam steps back and Mercedes steps forward with her scissors

without looking at him--

MERCEDES

She freezes, smiling, till the still photographers have gotten

their shots, then snips the cord to a pulley system that

lets the cloth drop--

STATUE

The cloth drops to reveal a bas-relief in brass set in a

block of smooth limestone.  A decent likeness of Buddy in

uniform, his hand on the shoulder of a small Chicano-looking

boy who stands beside him, eyes raised worshipfully.

APPLAUSE from the gathering--

SAM

Watching, a bit removed, as Mercedes shakes hands with Jorge

and H.L. and Hollis for the cameras. He overhears a pair of

BYSTANDERS who are checking out the statue--

The bystanders LAUGH--Sam steps away, intercepting Mercedes

as she steps away--

Mercedes just looks at him, keeps going. His gaze brings him

to Pilar, standing on the sidewalk, watching.

SAM

Steps over from the dispersing crowd--

EXT. RIVERSIDE -- DAY

Sam and PILAR walk together alongside the Rio--

She looks at him--

She shrugs.

They walk in silence a moment--

She looks at him--

They stop at a spot where you can climb down the bank--

Pilar looks at the spot. She isn't ready to deal with whatever

memory it brings back--

She waves and walks away, feeling awkward. Sam watches for a

minute, then turns and steps down to the bank, He looks at

the water.

RIVER SURFACE

A little piece of tree bark is tossed onto the water and

drifts away with the current. We TILT UP to see YOUNG PILAR

tossing bark into the river as YOUNG SAM sits on the bank

beside her. They are 14 and 15 years old--It is 1972--

Young Pilar frowns, tosses more bark--

CU YOUNG PILAR

She turns to look at him--

We PAN with her gaze to see Sam, PRESENT DAY, sitting on the

bank, lost in thought--

EXT. ARMY POST -- DAY

Athena walking between buildings, looking a bit out of it.

Sergeant Worth cuts into her--

Sergeant Worth watches Athena go, suspicious--

INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE -- AFTERNOON

Ray Hernandez and another DEPUTY guide Shadow back in from

the courthouse in handcuffs--

They guide him past Sam's desk--

Ray smiles, pushes him out--

We HOLD on Sam at his desk, TIGHTENING as he holds the .45

slug from the sergeants in front of his eyes--

INT. MERCEDES' KITCHEN -- NIGHT -- CU GLASS

We hear old MEXICAN MUSIC. Ice cubes plunk into a glass.

WIDER, MERCEDES

Mercedes, exhausted from a day at the cafe, pours herself a

Scotch and soda--

EXT. BACK PATIO -- NIGHT

The back LIGHT is flicked on and Mercedes steps out with her

drink in hand, the MUSIC audible from inside. She sinks into

a recliner. We TIGHTEN as she closes her eyes. Something

RUSTLES out In the dark. Mercedes opens her eyes. There is

WHISPERING. Mercedes sits up and suddenly two MEN run past

the edge of the patio toward the front of the house. Mercedes

sighs--

Mercedes searches to find a portable phone on the patio table,

punches a number in--

EXT. SAM'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

Sam, out of uniform, stands behind his little house chucking

fallen pecans out into the dark, thinking, listening to the

night sounds.

CU SAM

Working something out in his head. He looks off into the

dark and we PAN with his gaze--A MAN steps toward us, barely

visible in the darkness. It is Charley Wade--We're in Sam's

REVERIE, in 1957--

BLAM! A GUNSHOT, and Wade falls to his knees--

Wade falls on his face. A FLASHLIGHT BEAM flicks ON and plays

over his body. We PAN back along the be to see Buddy,

holstering his Pistol. He hears something, swings the

flashlight up.

SAM

We are back in 1995. Sam is blasted in the face with a

FLASHLIGHT BEAM--

The FLASHLIGHT BEAM PANS AWAY and ZACK POLLARD, a Border

Patrol agent, steps out of the dark to Sam--

Zack steps away.  Sam shakes the pecans still in his band,

goes back to chucking them--

EXT. COURTYARD -- DANCERS

Older CHICANO COUPLES dance to Mexican Music playing from

speakers set up in the apartment complex courtyard.  We TILT

UP to see Enrique watching from his window--

INT. APARTMENT -- NIGHT

MUSIC still blasting.  Enrique steps away from the window,

and sits on the bed of his drab furnished apartment. He goes

back to tying knots in a length of clothesline splicing it

to another. On the bed beside him are new flashlights and

the batteries, still in their packaging. He begins to coil

the rope--it is hundreds of feet long.

EXT. FRONT PORCH, PILAR'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

Pilar sits on her front Porch, listening to the MUSIC in the

distance. A woman singing a MEXICAN LOVE BALLAD. After a

while we hear Paloma open the screen door behind her--

A silence. They listen to the RECORD--

INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE -- EARLY MORNING

Sam has been up since dawn, searching through piles of old

department records. Papers cover his desk and the chairs

he's dragged over next to it. He reads out loud himself from

a report in front of him--

DOCUMENTS -- VARIOUS SHOTS

As Sam reads, we see quick pops of various records--

Certificates of death. An old Sheriff's Department payroll.

An autopsy report. Eviction notices.

Real estate transfers. A map of the Proposed Lake Pescadero.

Another autopsy report. A FAX COPY of the forensics dental

report on Charley Wade. Another autopsy report--

CU SAM

Intent as he pores over the paperwork--

CU SAM

Trying to put it all together.

PETE ZAYAS, a skinny, older man in trustee's coveralls,

wanders in, emptying the trash baskets in the front office--

Pete dumps out the basket by Sam--

Sam looks up at him.

Sam looks up again, troubled.

EXT. SAN JACINTO STREET -- MORNING

Ray Hernandez, heading in to work, comes upon Sam getting

into his car--

An awkward silence. Sam sits into the driver's seal and Ray

leans down to talk--

Sam looks at his Chief Deputy--

Sam smiles, turns the engine on--

EXT. SCHOOL -- MORNING

Pilar sits with Amado on the football field bleachers before

school starts--

A silence. Amado sulks.

They look, at each other for a long moment.

Pilar is nearly in tears.

EXT. BORDER CROSSING -- DAY

We see Sam's car roll through the "express lane" as other

cars in both directions stop by the inspection booths. Sam

drives across the bridge over the Rio--

EXT. STREETS -- CIUDAD LEON -- VARIOUS SHOTS

Sam drives slowly through the sprawling, more populous town

on the other side.  Lots of the streets are unpaved.  We PAN

with the car till we HOLD on ANSELMA, a country girl of 15,

aimlessly walking the streets--

EXT. LLANTERIA (TIRE REPAIR SHOP) -- DAY

We watch a KID about Amado's age pulling a tire off its rim

to put a patch on it--

CHUCHO AND SAM

CHUCHO MONTOYA, in his mid-50s, stands by Sam drinking a

Coke as they watch the kid work.

CHUCHO smiles, draws a line in the dirt with his heel--

Sam obliges--

Sam smiles, plays with the line with his toe--

CU CHUCHO

We PAN from CHUCHO to the FLAT TIRE on a battered old pickup

truck--

Eladio CRUZ, young and good-looking, squats into the shot to

examine the tire, jack in hand. It Is 1956--

CONJUNTO MUSIC comes from the truck RADIO. YOUNG CHUCHO steps

past Eladio--

We TRACK back with Young CHUCHO to see we are at the side of

a dirt road on the scrubby flatland near the border. Eladio's

battered pickup truck has wood-slat sides and a canvas top.

Eladio begins to undo the nuts on the flat tire as Young

CHUCHO climbs down into a dry creek bed to relieve himself--

CHUCHO tightens as he sees something, ducks down--

We PAN to see the Sheriff's car approaching in a cloud of

DUST--

INT. REAR OF TRUCK

Eight illegal WORKERS hear this and lie down, pulling a canvas

tarp over themselves. We hear the CAR STOP behind them--

EXT. ARROYO -- CU CHUCHO

He makes the sign of the cross as he presses his back against

the dirt of the arroyo--

ROAD

Sheriff Wade and Deputy Hollis get out of their car and start

toward Eladio--

ELADIO

He stands, takes a deep breath--Wade steps up to him with

his hard-eyed smile--

EXT. TRUCK

Young Hollis strolls around the truck as if he's considering

buying it.  He reaches in and flicks the RADIO OFF--

ARROYO -- CHUCHO

Young CHUCHO pecks over the edge to see what's happening.

CLOSER -- MEN

Hollis wanders over to stand by Wade--

ELADIO opens the truck door and digs under the seat. Wade

winks to Hollis, then turns and BLAM! shoots ELADIO through

the head. Hollis jumps back startled and horrified--

CU CHUCHO

Squatting in a ball to make himself as small as possible,

eyes covered with his hands.

Young CHUCHO hears FOOTSTEPS approaching. We PAN as he looks--

a man's BOOTS appear at the top of the arroyo. We TILT UP to

see a Sheriff, BACKLIT, then CRANE to see it is Sam, back in

the PRESENT looking over the site, troubled. His car sits on

the empty road behind him. He frowns, turns to go--

EXT. PARK -- DAY -- PLAQUE

Somebody has spray-painted "PERDIDO!" over the plaque of

Buddy and the little boy--

WIDER

Hollis and a couple of MEN from the Public Work Department

look at the damage.

INT. CAFE -- DAY

Enrique steels himself, trying to cover his nerves. We CROSS

with him to a booth.

Zack and another BORDER PATROLMAN look up at him--

CU ENRIQUE

Eyes glued to his notepad--

EXT. ROADSIDE STAND -- DAY -- CU CATTLE SKULL

A Georgia O'Keefe-looking cattle skull sits on a pedestal

against the Western sky--

We WIDEN as the skull is lifted by WESLEY BIRDSONG, a Native

American man in his 70s who wears extremely thick glasses.

Sam tags along as the old man rearranges the display of Texas

curios laid out in front of his trailer. Empty scrubland

surrounds them.

He winks at Sam, picks up a wooden radio carved to resemble

the Alamo--

He puts the radio on, looks out at the emptiness around--

He lifts a jar with a leathery brown thing in it--

He searches for something among the curios--

Wesley stretches out a four-foot rattlesnake skin, rattles

still attached--

He shakes the rattles at Sam--

INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY -- DAY

PILAR talks with Molly as they near the administration office--

Molly keeps going as Pilar ducks into the office--

INT. OFFICE

PILAR crosses past the principal's secretary, MARISOL--

PILAR takes the pile of mimeos and mail from her slot and

turns to go--

EXT. DRIVE-IN MOVIE -- NIGHT

It is 1972. An early-'70s cheezy action picture (Filipino

women-in-chains or biker flick is playing. We TILT DOWN to a

man's BOOTS crunching across the gravel of the parking area.

Now and then, the man turns a FLASHLIGHT BEAM on a license

plate. The cars are all pre-'72, lots of pickups, and the

patrons are almost all TEENAGERS. Some have turned their

pickups around to sit on the tailgate and watch, while others

have set lawn furniture out to sit on. We TILT UP slightly

to see the glint of a Rio County Sheriff's badge pinned on

the man's shirt. He meets a DEPUTY coming in the other

direction. Both train their FLASHLIGHTS on the license of

the car we see in the b.g. between them.  We TILT and RACK

to see that nobody is visible through the window--

We FOLLOW Buddy up to the driver's side of the car as the

Deputy goes to the passenger side. We PAN with Buddy's hand

down to the door handle--he grabs it, flings it open--the

overhead LIGHT flicks ON and there lie YOUNG SAM and PILAR,

teenagers, half their clothes off and just about to close

the deal. PILAR SCREAMS and the Deputy throws the door open

by their heads--

Buddy grabs Sam's ankles and yanks him out of the car onto

the ground as the Deputy awkwardly pulls PILAR, out the other

side--

Sam is trying to kick and punch at his father, pausing in

between to pull his pants up. People are BOOING and HONKING

their HORNS all around--

The kids are dragged forward into the HEADLIGHTS that are

being turned on to see what the ruckus is. Both are crying,

struggling--

They step closer into the glaring HEADLIGHTS which WHITE OUT

the scene, then FADE.

EXT. RUINED DRIVE-IN -- DUSK

It is DUSK, PRESENT DAY. Our eyes readjust to see Sam,

standing by his car in the lot of the long-abandoned drive-

in. The ruined screen rises in the b.g.

CU SAM

Remembering. MUSIC BEGINS as he gets back into the car, pulls

away.

MARQUEE -- DUSK

MUSIC CONTINUES as the car cruises out past the old marquee,

a few letters still jumbled on it, several bullet holes around

them.

INT. CAR

MUSIC CONTINUES as Sam drives, thinking--

EXT. ROADS -- VARIOUS SHOTS -- DUSK/NIGHT

MUSIC CONTINUES as the car crosses the scrubland back toward

town. DUSK turns to NIGHT--

EXT. PILAR'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

MUSIC CONTINUES as Sam cruises past Pilar's house. The car

is not in the driveway: Paloma hangs out with a couple FRIENDS

under the porch light, laughing--

EXT. HIGH SCHOOL -- NIGHT

MUSIC CONTINUES as Sam's car pulls into the high school lot.

He looks up toward the school--

EXT. WINDOW, PILAR, -- SAM'S POV

MUSIC CONTINUES. We can see PILAR, through the lighted window

of her classroom, preparing something on the blackboard--

INT. CAR

MUSIC ENDS as Sam leans back to wait--

EXT. PARKING LOT

PILAR digs in her bag for her car keys as she makes her way

across the lot. She sees something, slows, reacting, then

brings us to Sam in his car. He has parked head-to-foot next

to hers. They look at each other for a long moment

EXT. MAIN STREET -- NIGHT

Nothing stirring. Pilar's car appears, closely followed by

Sam's. The cafe has closed for the night.

INT. CAFE -- NIGHT

Sam and Pilar sit on chairs next to each other, facing the

window, talking softly. The STREETLIGHT shining through the

letters in the front window makes patterns on their faces

Pilar looks at him--

PILAR nods. She gets up and we FOLLOW her across the dark

room to the jukebox. She looks at the selections--

She puts in a quarter, punches some numbers. A Mexican BALLAD

comes on. She crosses back to Sam, holds her hand out. He

stands to greet her. They slow-dance in the empty cafe--

INT. SAM'S APARTMENT -- BEDROOM

Sam and Pilar finish making love. They lie beside each other,

shaking a little--

PILAR smiles, looks around the room--

Sbe puts her head on his cbest--

EXT. PILAR'S HOUSE -- MORNING

Paloma sits on the top step of the porch, reading teen

magazines. PILAR steps out behind her, dressed casually, and

squints at the day--

Paloma gives her a look, then holds a fashion page up for

her to see--

PILAR steps out into the sun--

INT. CAFE -- MORNING

Hollis is sitting alone in a booth, working on some heuvos

rancheros.  Sam slides in across from him--

Hollis sits back to look Sam in the eye--

Sam stands and walks away. We HOLD on Hollis, his appetite

gone--

EXT. BIG O'S -- MORNING

Chet steps around to the side entrance--

INT. BLACK SEMINOLE EXHIBIT -- DAY -- CU STATUE

We start on a statue of a BUFFALO SOLDIER made from spent

bullets and shell casings, then PAN to another, then WIDEN

to see Chet as he pokes his head in, the BELL of the door

ringing.  He steps in cautiously, looking around the room.

On the walls there are photo-blowups, some artifacts,

handlettered information on cardboard. Chet stops to look up

at a picture of a barechested Black man with a couple of

feathers stuck in his headband

Chet turns to see Otis standing back by, the door from the

bar--

Otis crosses to the poker table, begins to clean up--

They move on to some photos of very African-looking people

dressed in beautiful Seminole clothing--

Chet nods, looks around--

INT. DEL'S OFFICE -- DAY

Athena stands at attention as Del sits at his desk, reviewing

her record. He lets her stand for a long time before speaking--

Athena is confused, hesitates to speak--

Silence--

Del knows he asked for it, but doesn't like the answer--

Athena is sure she's overstepped her rank--

Del stands, thinking, trying not to bullshit her--

He is right in her face now--

Athena salutes, steps out. Del looks out the window, troubled

by the encounter.

EXT. BORDER CONTROL

A battered car full of Mexican DAY WORKERS rolls toward the

Mexican side checkpoint--

INT. CAR

Enrique sits squeezed between workers in the back. The driver

never stops talking as the officer waves them through.

EXT. KINCAID HOUSE -- DAY

Sam's car is parked on the street in front of an expensive-

looking house in a tree-lined neighborhood--

INT. LIVING ROOM

Sam's ex-wife, BUNNY KINCAID, shuffles across her living

room in slippers, crossing to turn off a big-screen TV playing

football highlights. Bunny wears shorts, a Houston Oilers

sweatshirt and a Dallas Cowboys cap. The living room is like

a sports museum-- signed footballs, team posters, a bookcase

filled with tapes of Texas pro and college football games--

She brings us to Sam, sitting uncomfortably, beneath a full-

sized blowup of Tony Dorsett hurdling a tackler--

She looks at him for an uncomfortably long moment--

Sam nods, stands. Bunny is in tears--

EXT. STREET -- CIUDAD LEON

Enrique looks nervously over his shoulder before stepping

into a funky apartment building. We TILT up to the second

floor balcony, where a LITTLE BOY is watching the street--

INT. APARTMENT

There are eight PEOPLE not including the little boy on the

balcony. All are securing their possessions--rolling things

in blankets, filling shopping bags and grain sacks. Enrique

steps in--

Anselma reaches up from the floor to take his hand--

INT. GARAGE -- KINCAID HOUSE -- DAY

A mess. We start on a campaign poster with Sam's face on it

and the legend--"ONE GOOD DEEDS DESERVES ANOTHER--VOTE SAM

DEEDS FOR COUNTY SHERIFF". We PAN to see Sam, who has been

digging through piles of old junk, set down the box he was

looking for--

CLOSER

Sam pulls out an old holster, a sheaf of real estate and

insurance forms, a couple of old paperback Zane Grey westerns.

He pulls out a cracked leather pouch, turns it over--letters

fall out. He examines an envelope--no stamp or postmark--

pulls a letter out, reads--

He puts the letter down for a moment, thinks. He needs to

know. He picks the letter up again, reads.

INT. OTIS'S HOUSE -- EVENING

Carolyn crosses the living room to answer the RING at the

front door.  Del stands there--

Del enters the house as if walking into an AMBUSH--

INT. OTIS'S LIVING ROOM -- EVENING

Carolyn sits back in the couch, drink in hand, checking Del

out--

CU DEL

Uncomfortable, sitting at the edge of an easy chair. He looks

at a mounted magazine photo of Otis smiling as he pours hot

sauce on a rack of ribs--

Del squirm a bit at the word "father"--

Del looks around the living room--

INT. DEN -- PHOTOGRAPH

A blowup of a photo of a squad of Buffalo Soldiers is mounted

on the wall--

CU DEL

He looks at something below --

DEL'S POV -- CLIPPINGS

We PAN slowly over laminated newspaper clippings mounted

behind a picture of young Del in a track uniform, holding a

vaulting pole. The clippings are about Del making honor rolls,

winning a Silver Star in Vietnam, graduating from Officer

Candidate School, being named head of this and that in the

Army--

DEL, CAROLYN

Carolyn stands behind, watching Del's face as he looks at

the stuff--

It's a bit too much for Del--

We HOLD on Carolyn as he hurries out. She salutes--

EXT. RIVER -- NIGHT

PEOPLE, crouching low, wade across the river toward us. When

he gets close enough to us, we recognize Enrique, nervously

leading a group of Mexican men, women and children to the

U.S. side. They are spaced out in the dark, loosely holding

the line Enrique made in one hand and holding their bundles

high away from the water with the other. Enrique turns as he

hears a WOMAN'S CRY.  The line goes slack, then NESTOR steps

out of the darkness to join him--

Two men struggle forward supporting Anselma, trying to hold

her leg out straight in front of her. She is in a lot of

pain--

Enrique thinks, trying not to panic, as the others come up

around him--

EXT. PATIO -- NIGHT

Mercedes sits on her recliner, drink in hand. An old RECORD

plays from inside. She is startled by the voice from the

dark--

Enrique steps out into the light. His pants are wet and he's

scared--

Nestor appears in the light now, supporting Anselma, who

hops awkwardly to move forward--

Mercedes grudgingly indicates the lounge chair--

He and Enrique help Anselma into the chair. The Girl looks

up at Mercedes, frightened--

Mercedes looks at ANSELMA disapprovingly. The girl can't be

more than 14--

EXT. HOUSE -- NIGHT

Sam stands at the front door of a house on the lake, banging

on the door--

EXT. RIVER -- NIGHT

Moonlight kicks off the surface of the water.  We hear

SPLASHING, the frightened VOICE of a young woman--

The girl flounders into the shot, wet and scared. Young

Mercedes, a teenager not unlike ANSELMA is wading thigh-deep

in the Rio, lost, scared--

Mercedes struggles toward the voice and suddenly a young man

becomes visible, standing in the water, holding his band out

for her, ELADIO--

He takes her arm, pulls her toward the far shore--

EXT. MERCEDES' HOUSE -- MERCEDES

Mercedes is lost in thought as she recalls. She steps into

the light by the carport. Enrique and Nestor are propping

Anselma's leg up on pillows in the back of Mercedes' old

station wagon--

Enrique turns to ANSELMA still frightened in the rear of the

station wagon--

Mercedes starts the car--

INT. DEL'S HOUSE -- DINING  ROOM

Del steps in. Chet sits at the table, drawing a cartoon in

panels. Del looks over his shoulder for a moment--

CARTOON

A tank rolling over barbed wire, cannon and machine gun

blasting away--

DEL AND CHET

Chet looks at him, not in a good mood, then goes back to his

drawing--

Del watches for a long moment, thinking--

Chet looks at his father again. All this is news to him--

Chet can't quite believe he is hearing this. Del crosses to

the refrigerator--

Chet nods, begins to play again, considering the

possibilities. Del is making an effort and he doesn't have

much practice--

An awkward silence--

Del pulls some food out, watching Chet as he draws--

Chet flips the page of his sketchbook--

EXT. PARKING LOT, BIG O'S -- NIGHT

The neon's off, but there are a couple cars in the lot and a

light within. Sam pulls into the lot, steps out, approaches

the door--

INT. CLUB

The door opens. The place is empty now except for Otis,

standing behind the bar, deep in conversation with Hollis,

sitting on a stool. Both swivel to look around guiltily as

they hear Sam step in--

REVERSE

Sam walks in slowly, crossing the floor to bring us back to

the two men--

He sits a few stools away from Hollis--

Hollis and 0tis look at each other--

He looks at the two older men for a long moment--

Otis sighs, begins to speak softly--

CU OTIS

He turns to look toward the door as he reminisces, and we

PAN away with his gaze--

Sheriff Wade and Young Hollis step in the door and we are

back in 1957. BLUES HARMONICA FADES UP, wailing from the

jukebox. They stop and look at the place--

THEIR POV -- CLUB

MUSIC CONTINUES. The club is empty, dark. A LIGHT shines

from the back room.

INT. BACK ROOM

MUSIC CONTINUES. Smoke fills the air and Young Otis sits

back laughing, a large pile of money on the table in front

of him. The other four BLACK MEN at the table aren't doing

so well. One by one they all look up past the camera to the

door--

CU OTIS

MUSIC CONTINUES. Young Otis doesn't see at first, engaged in

dealing the cards. Finally, he senses the presence, looks up--

WADE AND HOLLIS -- YOUNG O'S POV

MUSIC CONTINUES. Wade stands over the table in the f.g.,

Young Hollis hanging back in the doorway. Wade is smiling

his cold smile, cursing--

CU YOUNG OTIS

MUSIC CONTINUES. Trying to look unimpressed--

EXTREME CU WADE'S EYES

Cold and unblinking. MUSIC CONTINUES--

EXTREME CU WADE'S MOUTH

Twisted in a snarl as he curses. MUSIC CONTINUES--

MEN, TABLE

MUSIC CONTINUES. We shoot past Wade's body as the other men

step away from the table, grab their hats, and hurry out the

side door. Young Otis is left sitting at the table. Wade

starts walking toward him--

CU YOUNG OTIS

MUSIC CONTINUES. His eyes following as Wade comes to stand

over him--

WADE, YOUNG OTIS

MUSIC CONTINUES. Wade grabs the table and violently jerks it

over onto Young Otis, cards and money flying--

YOUNG HOLLIS

MUSIC CONTINUES. Watching squeamishly as Wade goes to work

on young Otis, the overhead light swinging wildly--

INT. BARROOM

MUSIC CONTINUES. Young Otis is hurled out of the back room,

face bruised and bleeding. Wade follows, then Young Hollis--

CLOSER

MUSIC CONTINUES.

CLOSER

Wade puts his gun next to Young Otis's ear, cursing at him.

Young Otis gets to his feet, goes behind the bar--

BAR COUNTER

MUSIC CONTINUES. Young Otis slaps an envelope full of cash

onto the counter--

WADE

MUSIC CONTINUES. He waves his pistol, indicating something

behind Otis--

INT. BAR

MUSIC CONTINUES. We shoot past Wade at the counter as Otis

turns and reaches for a cigar box on the shelf behind--

CIGAR BOX

MUSIC CONTINUES. Lying open, an old pistol inside of it.

Young Otis reaches--

CU YOUNG HOLLIS

MUSIC CONTINUES. Frowning as he senses something wrong--

WADE

MUSIC CONTINUES. Wade levels his gun at Young Otis's back,

then turns to wink at Hollis like he did before he shot Eladio--

WADE'S HAND

MUSIC CONTINUES. Finger closing around the trigger of the

.45--

HOLLIS

MUSIC CONTINUES. Mouth open in horror--

WADE

MUSIC CONTINUES. Eyes burning as he aims--

BUDDY

MUSIC CONTINUES. Stepping in the door, seeing, CALLS OUT--

YOUNG OTIS

MUSIC CONTINUES. Turning to see Buddy--

WADE

BLAM! THWAP! A bullet plows through his neck, knocking him

back against the bar.

MUSIC CONTINUES. His gun falls from his hand--

YOUNG OTIS

Horrified, splattered with the Sheriff's blood. MUSIC

CONTINUES--

BAR COUNTER

MUSIC CONTINUES. Twenty-dollar bills have spilled out of the

envelope and are soaking up blood--

CU BUDDY

Calm and hard-eyed. MUSIC CONTINUES. As he steps forward, we

see his pistol is still in its holster. He reaches out and

takes the .45 from Young Hollis's shaking hand, looks him in

the eye till Hollis looks back, then looks toward Young Otis--

We PAN with his gaze to a CLOSE-UP of Otis, back in the

PRESENT. The MUSIC FADES--

WIDER

This isn't what Sam was expecting. Hollis watches his face--

Sam swivels around on his seat to took at the spot where

Charley fell. He has a lot of information to deal with--

Sam rolls it over in his mind before answering--

Sam gets up--

He heads for the door--

Hollis and Otis watch him go--

EXT. DRIVE-IN, WIDE SHOT -- MORNING

We see Sam sitting on the hood of his car parked in the

deserted drive-in lot, staring up at the ruined screen.

Pilar's car rolls in, parks beside him--

CLOSER

Pilar gets out, kisses Sam, sits by him on the hood--

Sam looks at her for a moment--

CU PHOTO

Buddy and Young Mercedes on the lake. Buddy with his shirt

off on one end of a sailboat, Mercedes in a bathing suit,

both smiling for the camera--

SAM AND PILAR

Pilar hands the photo back to him, tries to be calm--

A silence, both of them wondering what the next move should

be--

Sam knows what he feels but doesn't have the words--

It is what Pilar needed to hear--

PILAR takes Sam's hand, kisses him--

WIDE SHOT, DRIVE-IN

Sam and Pilar sit by each other holding hands, looking at

the empty screen--

MUSIC, ROLL CREDITS
