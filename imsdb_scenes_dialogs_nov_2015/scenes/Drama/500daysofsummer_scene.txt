SIMPLE BLACK ON WHITE CREDITS ROLL TO BIG STAR'S "I'M IN LOVE

WITH A GIRL." When all is said and done, up comes a single

number in parenthesis, like so:

(478)

EXT. PARK - DAY

For a few seconds we watch A MAN (20s) and a WOMAN (20s) on a

park bench. Their names are TOM and SUMMER. Neither one says

a word.

CLOSE ON her HAND, covering his. Notice the wedding ring. No

words are spoken. Tom looks at her the way every woman wants

to be looked at.

A DISTINGUISHED VOICE begins to speak to us.

(1)

INT CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

The boy is TOM HANSEN. He sits at a very long rectangular

conference table. The walls are lined with framed blow-up

sized greeting cards. Tom, dark hair and blue eyes, wears a t-

shirt under his sports coat and Adidas tennis shoes to

balance out the corporate dress code. He looks pretty bored.

INT LIVING ROOM - 1989

PRE-TEEN TOM sits alone on his bed engrossed in a movie. His

walls are covered in posters of obscure bands. From the TV,

we hear: "Elaine! Elaine!"

INT OFFICE CUBICLE - PRESENT DAY

The girl is SUMMER FINN. She files folders and answers phones

in a plain white office. She has cropped blonde hair almost

like a boy's but her face is feminine and pretty enough to

get away with it.

INT BATHROOM - 1994

Teenage Summer stares at herself in the mirror. Her hair

extends down to her lower back.

She picks up scissors from the counter and begins to slice.

SPLITSCREEN. INT BOARDROOM/ INT CUBICLE - SAME

On the right side of the screen, Tom continues to listen to

some boring presentation. On the left, Summer answers a call,

takes a message, and walks out of her cubicle down a long

narrow hallway.

CU Summer opening the door to the boardroom, about to come

face to face with Tom for the first time.

But before they do,

BLACK.

(240)

EXT STREETS OF SAN FRAN - NIGHT

A 12 year old GIRL rides her bicycle down the block. She

arrives at an apartment complex, jumps off the bike and races

up the front stairs. She rings the doorbell.

INT TOM'S PLACE - LATER

PAUL and MCKENZIE open the door. These are Tom's best friends

since birth. Paul is a doctor and wears hospital scrubs.

McKenzie works in the cubicle next to Tom.

The Girl removes her bike helmet.

Tom is in the kitchen breaking things and basically going

insane. About to smash a plate on the floor, he's interrupted

BY:

Tom freezes.

Tom slowly obliges.

Tom sits next to the young girl. Paul and Mckenzie sit on

either side of them.

She hands him a glass of water. Tom drinks it down.

He gulps another down.

Tom takes a deep breath.

EXT PARK - DAY

Tom and Summer eat sandwiches in the park.

EXT OUTDOOR MARKET - DAY

Tom and Summer walk through the stalls.

EXT COFFEE HOUSE - DAY

Tom and Summer seated outside drinking coffee. He reads the

newspaper, she reads a novel.

EXT MOVIE THEATER - DAY

Tom and Summer walk out of a movie theatre.

INT RECORD STORE - LATER

Tom and Summer shop for music. Tom excitedly shows Summer a

Ringo Starr solo album.

INT TOM'S PLACE

INT DINER - NIGHT

Tom and Summer in a booth ordering dinner.

INT TOM'S PLACE - AS BEFORE

INT DINER - AS BEFORE

INT TOM'S PLACE - AS BEFORE

INT DINER - AS BEFORE

The Waitress comes out with the food. Tom and Summer stop

their discussion until the meal is served and the Waitress

leaves. Summer starts to eat.

Without another word she goes back to her pancakes. Tom

watches her eat like this is the worst travesty in the

history of mankind.

Tom looks at his food in disgust. He may never eat again.

Tom stands up to go.

THE SCENE FREEZES AND WE ZOOM IN ON TOM'S STUNNED FACE.

INT TOM'S PLACE - AS BEFORE

Silence for a few beats.

Tom drinks more vodka.

Paul and McKenzie share a very concerned look.

(86)

EXT SIDEWALK - DAY

Tom walks alongside his friend PAUL. Out of nowhere, he says:

CU - SUMMER'S SMILE

CU - SUMMER'S HAIR

CU - SUMMER'S KNEES

CU - SUMMER'S EYES

CU - SUMMER'S NECK

CU - SUMMER'S BREASTS (UNDER A BLACK T-SHIRT)

CU - SUMMER ASLEEP

CU - SUMMER'S LAUGH

OVER BLACK, play the middle 8 of "Every Little Thing She Does

is Magic" by The Police.

EXT SIDEWALK - SAME

Paul and Tom.

Paul is silent for a beat.

(1)

INT CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Tom as we saw him earlier. Bored. In the boardroom. Mckenzie

is in mid-presentation.

Mckenzie holds up a home-made photoshopped family portrait of

Martina Navratilova, Ellen DeGeneres, and the kid from "Jerry

Maguire".

The co-workers nod and digest this idea. VANCE is the head of

the department.

Tom is about to answer when... the door opens.

And in walks this girl. Summer. We've met her by now but Tom

hasn't. This is the first time. His eyes go wide and from

that moment on, he can't take them off her.

Summer gives a little wave before following Vance out.

She doesn't notice Tom whose face looks like he's just seen

God.

(3, 4, 5)

INT. OFFICE - DAY

Tom trying to work. And failing. He turns to McKenzie.

INT. ELEVATOR - LATER

Tom is listening to headphones. Summer enters the elevator

and Tom actively puts on a show to ignore her. Summer hears

the music.

Tom, pretending not to hear or care, gives her an

unenthusiastic wave.

Tom, still pretending, takes off his headphones.

A beat as Tom processes this information.

The elevator doors open and she gets off.

(8)

INT OFFICE LOBBY - DAY

The office sings "Happy Birthday" to a FEMALE CO-WORKER. When

they get to the part about her name, Tom is the only one who

knows it, everyone else just there for the cake. Song over,

everyone digs in. Tom finds himself standing next to Summer.

Oh, you know, 4, 5... years.

Really? Jesus. Did you always want

to write greeting cards?

Are you nuts? I don't even want to

do it now.

What is it you want to do?

I studied to be an architect

actually.

That's so cool! What happened?

Eh, you know. Same old story. Moved

to the city to work for a company.

Company went under. Needed a job.

My friend worked here. Got me this.

And are you any good?

Well I wrote that one.

"Today You're a Man. Mazel Tov on

your Bar Mitzvah."

It's a big seller.

I meant, are you any good as an

architect?

Oh... No. I doubt it.

Well, I'd say you're a perfectly

...adequate... greeting card

writer.

Tom does a spit-take and almost chokes.

There's an awkward silence.

She walks back to her cubicle at the other end of the hall.

Tom watches her walk away, completely enamored.

He sits down at his desk and sets out to work. But before he

does, his eyes fall on a sketch he drew of a house. It's

dated 2001 and it's the only architecture sketch on his wall.

(11)

INT TOM'S PLACE - DAY

Tom is playing Playstation with Rachel.

SARAH, 50s, Tom and Rachel's mother, stands in the doorway.

They do. Tom enters the living room area and sits down next

to his stepdad MARTIN, 60s, a quiet, professorial Southern

gentleman type.

ANGLE ON RACHEL and Sarah.

Sarah grows serious too.

STOCK FOOTAGE.

The Wright Brothers, Galileo, Heaven's Gate, Neil Armstrong.

END ON:

LITTLE TOM, age 6, mesmerized by a vinyl album cover of

Olivia Newton-John in "Xanadu."

(-8914)

INT CLASSROOM - DAY

Little Tom stares at a LITTLE GIRL, 6, who has the same

hairstyle and dress as Newton-John on that cover. Tom draws a

picture. It's a boy and a girl with a giant heart over them.

He stands up and walks over to the girl, putting the picture

on her desk. Not a word is spoken. Satisfied, he returns to

his seat and waits to see what happens.

The Little Girl stands up and walks the picture over to

ANOTHER BOY.

Tom is mortified. The OTHER BOY eats the drawing.

(-5313)

EXT FOOTBALL FIELD - NIGHT

A BLONDE CHEERLEADER leads the crowd in a cheer. PAN ACROSS

to find TEENAGE TOM, 15, finishing making out with a homely

HIGH SCHOOL GIRL. He says goodbye and walks off, looking back

longingly.

Once Tom is out of frame, a SECOND BOY approaches Wendy. Then

they start making out.

(-2825)

INT AIRPLANE - DAY

COLLEGE TOM sits next to his girlfriend REBECCA MYLES. His

smile gleams.

Across the aisle Rebecca makes eye contact with three COLLEGE

DUDES.

(-734)

EXT CAR - NIGHT

Younger Tom sits in the passenger seat. Raven-haired AMANDA

drives.

She puts a disc into the cd player.

A pop song begins to play on the stereo. They listen for a

few beats. Tom is confused.

Still Tom doesn't understand.

And with that, it slowly sinks in for him.

(22)

INT LOCAL DIVE BAR - HAPPY HOUR

Tom removes his headphones and sits defeated with McKenzie

and Paul in a booth.

INT ELEVATOR - THE DAY BEFORE

Tom is alone. The door opens. In walks Summer.

They ride in silence for a few beats.

INT LOCAL DIVE BAR - AS BEFORE

The friends wait for more.

Everyone's silent.

INT OFFICE - DAY

Tom types at his desk. Summer approaches the cubicle Tom

shares with McKenzie.

There's a beat.

INT OFFICE - LATE IN THE DAY

The office is emptying out. Only a few people remain but Tom

and Summer are two of them. Tom takes this opportunity to put

a CD in his computer and play the song really loud. It's "I

Want to Know What Love Is" by Foreigner. No reaction from

Summer. Tom turns it up. Still nothing. Tom turns it down,

defeated.

INT SUMMER'S DESK

Tom is there.

A beat. Summer says nothing.

They both laugh.

And when she walks away, he smacks his head a few times with

his palm.

INT LOCAL DIVE BAR - AS BEFORE

Tom's friends all look at him like he's crazy.

(27 & 28)

INT OFFICE - TOM'S CUBICLE - DAY

Tom sits at his desk with headphones on trying to work. But

with Summer down at the end of the hall, he's having a hard

time concentrating.

McKenzie shares a cubicle with Tom.

Tom looks over to where Summer sits. And realization dawns on

him...

INT KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT

Summer is in a back booth with some co-workers when Tom walks

in to the crowded place. McKenzie has the microphone and he's

singing "Every Rose Has Its Thorn" by Poison. He's real into

it and, well, it's kinda sad. Tom waves to McKenzie and walks

over to the booth.

Tom is at a loss. There's yet another awkward silent beat

between them. Thankfully, it's interrupted by...

Summer sees the next song come up on the screen.

She downs a shot and jumps up on stage.

Her co-workers whistle and cheer her on. She takes a deep

breath as the opening bars of "Born to Run" begin to play and

Summer starts to sing. Tom sees Summer as the actress in

whatever nonsensical karaoke video accompanies the song (it's

something to do with an old convertible, the sunset, and a

midget in a tuxedo.)

LATER. Tom sits in the booth with McKenzie (doing a shot) as

Summer chats with co-workers at another table. Tom can't help

but stare at Summer. She notices and waves. He smiles,

hopeful that she'll come over. She doesn't. He hides his

disappointment.

LATER. Tom walks back to his table with drinks. Summer is

there in mid-conversation with McKenzie.

She laughs. She's really cute when she laughs.

Tom shoots daggers at McKenzie for that comment. McKenzie

mouths "what?" Summer sees nothing.

Tom elbows McKenzie hard in the ribs to shut him up.

AN ANIMATION SEQUENCE, real quick. AN EXPLOSION OF MANY

DIFFERENT COLORS, COMPLETE WITH A CHOIR AND A CHURCH ORGAN

ALL BUILDING TO A HUGE CRESCENDO.

INT BAR

On Tom:

McKenzie senses some discontent.

Tom elbows him in the ribs again.

TEN MINUTES LATER. Tom is up there singing The Clash's

"Magnificent Seven." You wouldn't think so but Tom is a ROCK

STAR up there! He's dancing like Jagger, he's got everyone in

the bar singing along to the audience-participation parts.

It's a sight to behold. Summer is all smiles watching.

LATER. Tom and Summer back at the table. Summer is humming

something.

They're both having a good time.

They share another laugh and then it gets quiet. In that good

way.

ANGLE ON McKenzie, wasted, singing the shit out of "Proud to

Be an American." He really means it. At any minute he might

start to cry.

BACK ON TOM and SUMMER.

EXT KARAOKE BAR - LATER

Tom helps a nearly comatose McKenzie exit the place. Summer

is with them.

A cab arrives. Tom and Summer help McKenzie inside.

Tom shuts the door on McKenzie as fast as he can. Now it's

just Tom and Summer. Tom talks a mile a minute to try and

erase McKenzie's last exchange from her mind.

The wheels are spinning in Tom's head. What's the right

answer here?

Tom was clearly hoping for her to say something else. He

hides his disappointment the best he can.

Silence.

Tom watches her walk away for a beat before he turns to go

the other way.

Tom walks a few more steps.

And then, seemingly out of nowhere, without his even

noticing, SUMMER HAS WRAPPED HER ARMS AROUND HIM AND PULLED

HIM INTO A KISS!

It's unbelievable. There's a few seconds where Tom isn't sure

if he's dreaming or not. But then he realizes, suddenly, out

of the blue, his best case scenario really is actually

happening.

(29)

FADE UP: "YOU MAKE MY DREAMS COME TRUE" by Hall and Oates.

EXT STREET - MORNING

It's the greatest morning of all time!

Tom walks down the street. Or, more accurately, Tom struts

down the street. He's pointing at people as he passes,

winking, doing a little shuffle. He is the man. He checks out

his reflection in a window. A YOUNG PAUL NEWMAN stares back.

People wave as he passes, they clap, they give him thumbs up.

A parade forms behind him. The POSTMAN, a POLICE OFFICER, the

HOT DOG VENDOR, RONALD MCDONALD and MAYOR MCCHEESE, everybody

loves Tom today. HALL and OATES themselves walk with Tom

singing the song.

Cars stop at crosswalks to let Tom go by. The DRIVERS also

pump their fists in celebration of Tom's achievement last

night. He walks on, the man. We notice the sidewalk lights up

every time he touches the pavement like in "Billie Jean".

CARTOON BIRDS fly onto Tom's shoulder. He smiles and winks at

them.

INT OFFICE - SAME

Tom passes Summer's office whistling Hall and Oates. She sees

him and immediately lights up.

Vance pokes out of his corner office.

And they're all business. As Tom turns to go, however, Summer

gives him a little coy smile that would be enough to make

anyone's day complete. Tom gives her the international signal

for `I'll call you later' in return. Vance sees none of it.

Tom walks to his cubicle, still on top of the world.

INT TOM'S PLACE - THAT NIGHT

Tom answers the door. It's Paul (in hospital scrubs).

He walks inside without waiting for an invite.

Suddenly, the sound of a toilet flushing is heard. From the

bathroom emerges Summer, dressed to go out.

Tom quickly shuts the door on Paul.

Tom realizes she's heard it all.

(198)

INT CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Tom and Summer eating, not really talking much. At another

table, Tom sees a VERY UNATTRACTIVE COUPLE feeding each other

food.

Summer sees. She has no reaction.

Summer keeps eating.

Summer goes back to eating. Tom can't believe she snapped.

(31)

INT RESTAURANT - NIGHT

An equally UNATTRACTIVE COUPLE go at it in a booth. PAN

ACROSS to find Tom and Summer early in their relationship, in

a booth across the room, watching in hysterics.

Summer, her cheeks flushed already from laughing, loses it

again. They are having a great night.

They laugh some more. She is in hysterics.

Tom is a little surprised.

Tom is visibly disappointed by this but he tries to hide it.

A beat.

INT TOM'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

Summer and Tom come bounding in, lip-locked and all over each

other. They fall on his bed and begin undressing each other.

Suddenly, Tom stops.

He walks into the hallway, out of her sight. He looks into

the hallway mirror.

He takes a few deep breaths.

We watch from behind as he re-enters his bedroom. Where

Summer waits. Under the covers. Naked.

Tom can't help but do a little celebration dance.

LATER. Sex has been had. Summer is asleep. Tom lies next to

her. He still can't help but be ecstatic. He is pumping his

fists in the air and silently shouting "Woo Hoo!!!!"

(388)

CU - TOM. LOOKING THE WORSE FOR WEAR. UNSHAVEN, LONG HAIR,

CRUMPLED CLOTHING. IN SHORT, HE'S A MESS.

CU - SUMMER'S SMILE (as before)

CU - SUMMER'S HAIR (as before)

CU - SUMMER'S KNEES (as before)

CU - SUMMER'S EYES (as before)

CU - SUMMER'S NECK (as before)

CU - SUMMER'S BREASTS (as before)

CU - SUMMER ASLEEP (as before)

CU - SUMMER'S LAUGH

OVER BLACK, play the middle 8 of "Every Little Thing She Does

is Magic."

CU - TOM.

REVERSE ANGLE on A TROLLEY FULL OF PEOPLE, terrified of this

raving lunatic.

INT OFFICE - DAY

Tom passes Summer's desk. A new SECRETARY sits there. He

notices, in the trash, a reprint of an avant garde surrealist

painting of two dogs humping. He stops and retrieves it from

the bin like it's some family heirloom. He gives the

secretary a dirty look for tossing it.

(35)

INT. SF MUSEUM OF MODERN ART - DAY

CU: the same painting.

ANGLE ON Summer and Tom looking at it curiously.

CU: a second painting which is nothing but red.

ANGLE ON Summer and Tom looking at it with the same

expressions.

CU: a third painting which could only be, well, poop.

ANGLE ON Summer and Tom, still perplexed but trying.

They say nothing, until:

EXT. MOVIE THEATER - LATER

The marquee reads "Part Vampire. Part Giant. `VAGIANT!'"

INT. MOVIE THEATER - CONT.

The theater is packed. Everyone is laughing and screaming and

throwing popcorn. Tom and Summer are having a great time.

(51)

EXT TRANSAMERICA BUILDING - DAY

Summer and Tom stand on San Francisco's most interesting

street corner, where the ultra-modern Transamerica Building

stands next to the ancient Columbus Tower.

EXT PALACE OF FINE ARTS - DAY

Summer and Tom in front of the famed Roman-style structure.

EXT YERNA BUENA GARDEN - DAY

Summer and Tom sit on the steps which offers a stunning view

of the city's architectural marvels.

They really do seem at peace.

EXT SONY METREON - DAY

Tom and Summer in front of the gargantuan mirrored building.

Summer gives him a pen from her purse and the underside of

her arm. Tom thinks about this. Then he starts to draw a

sketch on her skin. We catch her watching his face as he

draws. She's attracted to his enthusiasm.

(55)

EXT OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

Tom and Summer, who have ridden together to work, stand

outside the building.

A CO-WORKER passes.

Summer joins the co-worker and walks in.

She turns back to look at Tom on the way. She sticks out her

tongue to be cute. Co-Worker doesn't see. Tom is crazy about

her.

INT OFFICE - LATER

Tom at his cubicle with the one architecture sketch. The

phone rings and he picks it up.

INT COPY ROOM - DAY

Summer is on her cell phone in the office copy room. She

begins to sing the theme song to "The A-Team."

McKenzie enters and sees her singing into the phone. Turns

without a word and leaves.

INT TOM'S CUBICLE - SAME

Tom listening to her sing. McKenzie comes over.

Tom is too wrapped up in the phone call to acknowledge him.

The smile on his face is the biggest we've seen yet.

(68)

INT. SHOWER - LATER

We just see the curtain, but we can see their silhouettes

behind it. Summer and Tom are trying to have sex in the

shower. They're trying to stable themselves, grip something

so as not to fall, elbows are flying, it's a mess.

The curtain rips and the bar comes crashing down. They fall

on top of each other laughing.

(77)

INT VIRGIN MEGASTORE - NIGHT

Tom and Summer wander through the aisles.

Summer drags Tom into the curtained-off "Porn" section. She

picks up a box.

INT. SUMMER'S APARTMENT - LATER

Tom and Summer get comfortable. Both are excited and looking

forward to this. The movie starts, the credits roll. Tom and

Summer start to make out a bit, both keeping an eye on the

TV.

INT. SUMMER'S APARTMENT - 20 MINUTES LATER

Tom and Summer, watching the movie. Intently. They've even

got popcorn.

(79)

INT SPORTS BAR - NIGHT

Tom, Mckenzie and Paul are having a drink.

Beat.

Tom takes a second to think about this.

(80)

EXT FIELD - DAY

Rachel is playing field hockey on the 7th grade team. Tom is

watching from behind the players' bench. A whistle blows and

Rachel comes back and sits down.

The whistle blows again and Rachel gets up to go back on the

field.

On Tom, we:

INT TOM'S CAR - THAT NIGHT

Tom and Summer driving on the Golden Gate. Tom is very

conflicted and we can see it in his face. They're silent a

few beats, before:

He's not. He clenches his teeth. And begins...

He takes a deep breath. He's about to go on when:

Summer finds on the radio a particular song. ("Waiting in

Vain" by Bob Marley, if you must know.)

And it is. Tom's hand is on the gear shift. She puts hers

there and locks it with his. Tom listens and Tom watches

Summer listening. There's something about this moment, the

way she sings along, the way her eyes close during certain

notes, the way her smile rises and falls like she could cry

at any minute from being overwhelmingly happy or just simply

overwhelmed. Tom is powerless to stop his feelings for this

girl.

Marley sings:

We know, as well as he does: he will ask nothing tonight.

(172)

INT PARTY - NIGHT

Tom and Summer are in a LARGE CIRCLE OF PEOPLE at a party.

TIME CUTS reveal that Summer is talking with, laughing with,

drinking with, and possibly flirting with many of them. Tom

notices, smiles, pretends it doesn't mean anything, but he's

clearly jealous, not in a sexual way but of the attention

they're getting from her. It's been a while. He misses that

attention.

(272-286)

INT. BOOKSTORE - DAY

Tom, starting to get that unshaven, unkempt look, wanders

through the self-help section. He leafs through some of the

titles. He grabs just about every one of them.

INT. APARTMENT - LATER

Tom has more than fifty self-help books on a shelf by his

bed. He reads from one called "Six Steps to Getting Over

Him."

SECONDS LATER. Tom sits in his bed eating ice cream. He

continues to read.

He slowly puts the ice cream down.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Tom jogs.

Cars pass him at top speed. Bicycles breeze by him. A child

on a big wheel soars past. He may as well be jogging in

place.

INT. YOGA CENTER - NIGHT

Tom is taking a yoga class.

This shit is really fucking hard when you're as inflexible as

Tom. Everyone else in the class seems at peace. Tom can't

even get the breathing right.

INT. HOMELESS SHELTER - DAY

Tom feels good about himself as he gives out food to the

homeless.

Next in line is a HOMELESS COUPLE holding hands. Tom spirits

immediately fall. Even these two somehow found each other.

INT SHOE STORE - DAY

Tom stands in the center of a fashionable ladies shoe store.

ANGLE ON TOM, just sorta standing there. Confused. He doesn't

really want new shoes.

EXT. FOREST - DAY

Tom backpacks alone in the forest.

This is it, he's finally found some peace. Tom looks up to

the tops of the trees where the sunlight is peeking in and

takes a deep breath.

FREEZE ON TOM.

INFORMATION BUBBLES pop up on the screen to point out that

Tom is standing in POISON OAK. There's a RUSTY BEAR TRAP a

step ahead of him. A giant POISONOUS SNAKE creeping up

behind him. A TICK on his leg. And in the distance a HUNTER

has Tom sized up in his rifle sight.

UNFREEZE.

Tom starts to itch...

INT. APARTMENT - LATER

Tom is painting the walls of his now nearly bare apartment.

He's focused on his task and in fact seems pretty good at it.

We pull back to REVEAL Tom has painted a giant mural of

Summer on his wall. He looks at the self-help book and

dropkicks it.

(145)

INT CROWDED BAR - NIGHT

Summer and Tom stand by the bar.

A tall, well-built, GOOD-LOOKING DOUCHEBAG GUY has suddenly

appeared next to them.

Tom and Summer stop talking.

Tom puts his hands in his pockets and watches this exchange

go down. Not sure what else to do. At this point he's more

amused than concerned.

Tom smiles to himself. This guy's a tool. Nothing to worry

about.

As she answers Summer gives a quick glance over to Tom. The

Guy notices. Up to this point he had not connected the two of

them together.

Tom realizes he has to sort of say something now.

Tom is pleased.

And now he's pissed.

Summer and Tom make eye contact again, as if to say "now

what?" After a beat:

And that question hangs in the air. Tom, panicked, decides to

cut the silence. All the pent up uncertainty and confusion,

coupled with the challenge to his manhood in front of the

woman he loves, all manifests in one single, solid, almost

automatic RIGHT CROSS TO THE GOOD LOOKING DOUCHEBAG'S FACE.

Which connects spot on and sends the Douche reeling.

Both Douche and Tom wince at the pain (Douche's chin, Tom's

fist).

There's a beat of calm where Tom is actually sorta surprised.

And then the Douche spins around and starts PUMMELLING TOM.

EXT BAR - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Having been thrown out, Summer and Tom exit the place. Tom is

a bloody mess, granted, but feels pretty great about it.

Summer starts walking ahead and Tom notices for the first

time she's furious.

Tom waits for more. It doesn't come.

It's silent. He doesn't know what to do or say or think.

Neither of them say a word as they go their separate ways.

Only the CROWD outside the bar hear this.

(146 & 147)

INT. OFFICE - LATER

Tom is in the photocopy room with a bandage on his nose.

Summer walks in, not realizing he would be there. She stops

short.

Nothing else is said.

He starts to walk out.

Tom walks out. He looks back but she isn't looking. When she

looks back at him, he's gone.

LATER. Tom about to leave the office. Passes Summer's desk.

She's on the phone. He wants to stop and say something but

she's busy. He walks on. She never knew he was there.

LATER. Summer, packed up to go, walks over to Tom's cubicle

but he's already gone.

SPLITSCREEN - INT. BOTH APARTMENTS - THAT NIGHT

Left: Tom tosses and turns in his sleep.

Right: Summer lies awake, staring at the ceiling.

Left: Tom picks up the phone. Is about to dial when he stops

himself and hangs up.

Right: Summer looks at her phone, willing it to ring. It

doesn't.

INT TOM'S BEDROOM - HOURS LATER

Tom is awakened by a buzzer. He hits the "sleep" button but

the buzzing isn't coming from his alarm. It's his door. He

gets up, concerned, and goes to answer it. It's Summer.

A beat.

She comes in and kisses him. He thinks about it for a second.

Is this enough to assuage his doubts? Damn it, she wins

again. He shuts the door in our faces.

INT TOM'S BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

Tom and Summer in the wee hours.

INSERT: Still photograph of MARKUS. Or at least how he

appears in Tom's mind. Arm cocked, about to throw the winning

touchdown pass.

INSERT: Still photograph of KURT. As Tom envisions him.

Playing the guitar on stage in Motley Crue.

INSERT: Still photograph of THE PUMA. A swarthy Italian

posing in front of a Vespa moped in tight Gucci pants, his

boner clearly trying to escape.

Tom has no idea. And he doesn't want to know.

On TOM. Silent for a few beats. Did he want to hear that?

(290S)

EXT. STREET - DAY

Tom, unshaven, un-showered, walks by himself. He turns a

corner and sees Summer walking towards him. As she gets

closer he sees it's not her after all and breathes a sigh of

relief.

INT. BEDROOM - LATER

Tom watches TV. An advertisement for toothpaste comes on. Tom

could swear the actress was Summer.

INT TROLLEY - DAY

A trolley going the other direction passes by. EVERY

PASSENGER ON IT IS SUMMER. Tom is a fucking mess.

(302)

EXT RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Tom and an attractive girl we haven't seen before walk

towards an outdoor cafe. Her name is ALLISON. It's clear

right away that Tom can't wait for this night to end already.

INT RESTAURANT - LATER

Tom and Alison eat. In silence.

Beat.

More silence.

Alison looks at her food. Tom realizes he's been difficult,

starts to feel kinda bad.

EXT TRANSAMERICA BUILDING - (BACK ON DAY 51)

Summer and Tom stand on the street corner looking at the

buildings.

Tom keeps talking. Summer turns and looks directly at the

CAMERA.

INT RESTAURANT - SAME

Tom and Alison.

INT SUMMER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - (FROM DAY 39)

From the scene in which Tom and Summer first slept together.

He's sleeping like a baby, probably the best sleep he's had

in a long while. Summer lies next to him. Wide awake. Bored

and unfulfilled.

INT RESTAURANT - SAME

Tom and Alison. Alison is desperately trying to get a drink.

INT ELEVATOR - DAY - (FROM DAY 22)

Tom and Summer ride in silence for a few beats.

INT RESTAURANT - SAME

Now Alison is really confused. And it's right around the part

where Tom starts totally cracking up.

INT KARAOKE BAR - LATER

Tom is, yes, on stage singing another song by The Clash,

"Train in Vain." Not so much singing as having a nervous

breakdown to music.

Alison sits by herself in a booth trying to hide her face.

On Alison, having the worst date ever.

(219)

INT TOM'S BATHROOM - NIGHT

Tom is getting dressed for a big fancy night out. A punkish

pop song plays in the b.g. that he occasionally boogies down

to. He's excited.

He tucks his shirt into his pants. He ties his tie. He

brushes his teeth with aplomb. He looks for, finds, and

plucks a grey hair from his head. He makes some faces into

the mirror.

Satisfied, he grabs his coat and hits the street.

EXT SAN FRANCISCO STREET - SAME

Tom walking in the Spring air, feeling good. The phone rings.

INTERCUT WITH:

INT SUMMER'S APARTMENT - SAME

Summer on the cell as she enters her apartment. She looks

like she's coming back from the gym.

Tom is standing still now, no longer moving. He's trying to

keep his frustration from being audible.

But the line is dead. Tom's head sinks into his chest. Yet

another frustrating night...

CU PAUL, TALKING DIRECTLY TO THE CAMERA DOCUMENTARY STYLE

CU MCKENZIE.

CU RACHEL.

CU VANCE.

CU SUMMER

CU MCKENZIE

CU PAUL

CU TOM.

He says nothing. Just stands there. So confused. We go right

INTO:

ANIMATION. A QUICK 5 second recap of the earlier color

sequence.

(101)

INT OFFICE - DAY

Tom is wandering through the office whistling.

Tom walks by the room marked "Weddings and Anniversaries."

He's about to keep going when he pauses.

INT WEDDINGS AND ANNIVERSARIES SUITE - LATER

All of the people who work in here are MIDDLE AGED WOMEN.

Currently, they are standing around one desk where Tom sits

writing everyone's cards.

The Women clutch their heart like they might faint.

INT RELIGIOUS HOLIDAYS WING - LATER

Workers are again all gathered around Tom.

Tom says something totally in Yiddish. No one knows what the

hell he just said except for one Employee who bursts out in

tears of joy.

INT OFFICE HALLWAY - LATER

Tom passes Summer at her desk. She waves. He waves back. He's

so in love with her.

INT ANOTHER WING - LATER

ANGLE ON TOM writing furiously at a computer terminal.

The AFRICAN-AMERICAN MAHOGANY WRITERS are impressed.

(222)

EXT MOVIE THEATRE - NIGHT

Tom and Summer in line to buy tickets.

Suddenly, Tom sees something at the front of the line.

And here they come, Tom's mom and step-dad, Sarah and Martin.

Tom's face registers a noticeable panic.

Sarah and Martin are delighted at this coincidence. Sarah

hugs and kisses her son.

Summer smiles. Maybe this will be ok.

Sarah hugs Summer.

And now Martin weighs in with his own hug. Tom notices

Summer's face growing increasingly concerned. Why is he

hugging me?

Tom is caught like a deer in headlights. What can he do?

Again, this has become incredibly awkward for Tom and for

Summer.

When they're out of earshot, Tom sees that Summer is

distraught.

There's that word again.

Summer looks at Tom, like she's disappointed or even angry at

him for something. Then she walks ahead of him into the

theatre. He's forced to follow. Answer-less, as conflicted as

ever. Why is none of this easy?

INT MOVIE THEATRE - LATER

Summer, Tom, Sarah, Martin in a row. Summer's face is cold,

emotionless. Tom tries to look at her, to make eye contact,

something. She knows he's looking but it doesn't make her

head turn his way. Tom gives up and watches the movie.

ANGLE ON THE MOVIE SCREEN. We see a BLACK AND WHITE FILM.

It's a MAN racing down the street, fleeing from an unseen

assassin. When he turns around we see the man is TOM. Bullets

fly and he's hit repeatedly in the back while running away

like Belmondo in BREATHLESS. He dies an elaborate, violent,

horrible on-screen death.

(228)

INT CLUB - NIGHT

Rave music blares. Tom stands off to the side looking

miserable. Summer is on the dance floor. Though she's not

really dancing with anyone in particular, she's dancing with

everyone. Finally she comes over, white shirt dripping with

sweat and clearly a little high on one thing or another.

He walks off. She feels some guilt for a second.

But when he doesn't turn around she just shakes it off and

starts dancing again.

LATER. Tom is outside in the rain. We can still hear the

music blaring from the club. Summer is in there. Tom is

alone. He can't believe it's come to this.

(251)

FADE UP: "YOU MAKE MY DREAMS COME TRUE" by Hall and Oates.

EXT STREET - MORNING

The worst morning ever.

Tom walks down the street. Or, more accurately, Tom sulks

down the street. Though it's sunny and warm, Tom is a sad,

broken man and the world is an awful place. There's still

Hall and Oates following Tom, almost trying to cheer him up.

He checks out his reflection in a window. Ron Howard's

brother Clint looks back.

Tom walks by a COUPLE making out on a bench. He grimaces.

He walks by a sign that says "TODAY ONLY: FREE BEER." He

doesn't even stop.

Cartoon Bird returns but Tom swats it away.

The WORLD'S MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN stops to ask him for

directions. He doesn't even look up.

Tom's parade of supporters, The Postman, Mayor McCheese, all

of them shake their heads and give him disapproving looks.

The Cartoon Bird takes a cartoon shit on Tom's shoulder. Tom

tries to kill the bird. Can't even manage that.

INT OFFICE - SAME

He passes Summer desk on the way in. She's no longer there.

He miserably sits down at his desk, tries to work but he ends

up just staring into space.

INT VANCE'S OFFICE - DAY

Tom has been called into the Principal's office.

He hands him some sympathy cards.

He quickly ushers him out of the office.

(383)

INT TOM'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Tom wakes up. He gets his bearings and then quickly rolls

onto the floor and begins a brief push-up routine.

The phone rings. Tom stops his push-ups to answer it.

INT DELI - DAY

Tom walks in to find Paul and McKenzie at a table. They look

extremely nervous.

Neither one answers him. They look at each other. Finally...

Mckenzie and Paul just sit there. Now more uncomfortable than

ever. On Tom, we:

EXT DELI - SECONDS LATER

Tom comes charging out of the place with his friends

following behind.

On Tom's pained face we...

INT TOM'S BEDROOM

Tom is going apeshit in his room. He's ripping down posters,

taking pictures out of frames and tearing them apart. He

punches the wall. He drinks an entire bottle of red wine. He

tries to find something to kick and can't. He throws his cell

phone off his balcony. Finally he collapses on the bed.

(384)

INT TOM'S BEDROOM

The half-destroyed alarm clock goes off. Tom hits the off

button.

(385)

INT TOM'S BEDROOM

Same exact thing.

(386)

INT SUPERMARKET - DAY

Tom, in a robe and boxer shorts, buys milk, OJ, cigarettes,

Jack Daniels, and twinkies.

The CLERK eyes him suspiciously.

EXT STREET - SAME

Tom sees a COUPLE kissing on the sidewalk. He winces. He sees

ANOTHER COUPLE entwined on a bench. It's killing him. He sees

a THIRD COUPLE walking towards him holding hands. He snaps.

They look at this lunatic in his robe and quickly walk away.

(387)

INT TOM'S BEDROOM

Alarm clock. We PAN ACROSS to see Tom is wide awake. He

probably hasn't slept in a day or so. He has no reaction to

the alarm.

INT OFFICE - LATER

Tom actually wanders in to work, wearing sunglasses and the

clothes he slept in. People pass and say hello. He can't

muster responses. At his desk,

Nothing.

INT BOARDROOM - LATER

Tom sits next to McKenzie and across from Vance. He's in his

usual boardroom position, which is to say, near comatose.

A female CO-WORKER, 50s, stands at the front of the room in

mid-presentation, showing slides that have something to do

with a cat in various poses. First we see, "Cat Reaching Up

for Out-of-Reach Milk Bowl."

She clicks to the next slide. "Cat Hanging From Tree Branch."

Click. We see "Cat Considering a Giant Leap."

She takes her seat.

He points to the screen, still showing the "Cat About to

Leap" image.

Tom is getting excited. The rest of the room is growing

uncomfortable.

Vance and the card-writing team are appalled.

Tom recognizes he's losing his shit. He takes a seat on the

boardroom table.

Everyone shifts in their seats.

Tom gets up and walks to the door.

And with that he gets up and walks off. The room is pretty

stunned. Someone coughs. McKenzie tries to start a clap. It

doesn't really take.

EXT BUILDING - MINUTES LATER

Tom comes outside with some boxes. He stands out in front of

the building. His face says one thing. "Holy shit. Did I just

do that?!" And then we,

(383)

EXT DELI - SAME AS EARLIER

Tom and his friends on the sidewalk outside the deli.

His friends say nothing.

And with that he storms off.

ANGLE ON Tom walking away from them.

Literally, his entire universe falls apart.

FX: BUILDINGS come crumbling down. The whole city turns to

rubble. He's the only constant as the world around him is

ERASED, brick by brick, beam by beam, as if by an unseen

force and reduced to nothing.

BLACK.

And we fade up those famous OPENING BARS OF "HAVA NAGILA."

(399)

CU on a CIRCLE OF PEOPLE HOLDING HANDS, some young, some old,

Tom right in the mix trying hard to smile. Has he joined a

cult?

We are:

INT BALLROOM - NIGHT

Tom's sister Rachel's Bat Mitzvah. Tom and his family have

formed a traditional Hora. They dance in a big circle and

clap their hands. A chair is brought to the center and Rachel

is lifted high above the circle by Tom, his step-dad, and

some others.

LATER. Rachel is standing by a cake with a microphone.

ANGLE ON TOM sitting with his mom Sarah at the table. They

clap. Mom looks at her son knowing something is wrong. Tom

catches her looking.

LATER. Tom being accosted by two more Aunts.

I can't believe it either!

What are you 30? You should be

married now. With a family. What

are you waiting for?

The right girl I guess.

There's girls everywhere. I bet you

have to beat em off with a stick.

Oh you'd be surprised.

Look at this punum. Are all those

girls blind?

My friend Mimi has a granddaughter.

Yay high. Great figure. Bosom out

to here --

Hey I appreciate that Aunt Betsy.

Lord knows I like bosoms. It's

just... I recently got out of

a...well, I don't know what it was.

Oh I'm sorry. When was that?

July.

You mean...seven months ago?

Was it a man?

What?

She's means `are you a homosexual?'

Awkward.

LATER. Tom at the bar. He downs his drink in one gulp.

LATER. ANGLE ON Tom alone at the table. The band plays "Lady

in Red" and everyone's dancing. When we're back on Tom, he's

sitting with Summer.

ANGLE ON RACHEL, dancing with a BOY.

ANGLE ON TOM. Alone. Still not smiling. Rachel arrives in the

nick of time.

She drags him to the dance floor.

It's silent a few beats.

She hugs him. Tight. He doesn't cry but he could.

He sees a coven of 13-year olds swooning across the dance

floor at him.

The song ends.

She blows him a kiss and then runs off and joins her girls.

Tom watches her go.

(240)

SPLITSCREEN - TOM'S BEDROOM/ SUMMER'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Tom is wide-awake, sitting fully dressed on his bed putting

his shoes on. He holds the phone up to his ear.

Summer is half-asleep under the covers. The phone lays at her

side and she angles towards it.

EXT PARK - DAY

Tom and Summer are having a picnic. If it looks familiar,

it's cause we saw them here on page 7. This is that fateful

day Tom described to his sister and his friends. The day it

all, finally, fell apart.

Not much more to say. Stay with them for a few extra beats of

silence.

EXT OUTDOOR MARKET - LATER

Tom and Summer shopping at the fruit market. Unless we were

looking for trouble we wouldn't see any. But since we are, we

might notice she lags behind him as they walk through the

aisles. His hands are in his pockets. He's bored. She's

distant. But only if we're really looking.

(406)

INT. APARTMENT - LATER

Tom, almost with a full beard, is redecorating his apartment

again. We see him rearranging the furniture in the room.

LATER. He hangs some new pictures.

LATER. He uses a pencil on the wall to mark for a bookshelf.

Then he uses a ruler to make sure his marks are even. He

draws a faint line on the wall to mark where he needs to nail

something.

(240)

INT COFFEE HOUSE - LATER

That day again. As we've seen before, Tom reads a newspaper.

Summer reads a novel.

A few more silent beats. Something's in the air.

INT MOVIE - LATER

Tom and Summer watching the film. Tears begin to well in

Summer's eyes. They soon turn to audible sobs. Tom turns to

look at her, to offer some sort of comfort, believing it to

be a response to the movie. She doesn't look back.

(409)

INT TOM'S BEDROOM - DAY

Tom drawing a straight line on his wall. Redecorating.

And then he stops.

He looks at the line he's drawn. He extends it a little bit.

He draws another. He begins to furiously draw on the wall.

From out of nowhere, inspiration has hit. An image starts to

form. A pretty impressive looking futuristic skyscraper,

almost shaped like a tear drop.

(240)

EXT MOVIE THEATRE - LATER

Same day from the past. They walk out, at first everything's

alright. It's exactly as we saw on page 7. But soon after

that she begins to cry again. Serious, real sobbing.

He goes to hug her. He hugs her. It's unclear if she hugs

back.

She smiles, tries to pull herself together.

They walk.

INT RECORD STORE - NIGHT

Tom and a much more in control Summer walk down the aisles.

He grabs one.

He grabs a Ringo Starr album and shows it to her, just as

we've seen on Page 7. She smiles and they continue on down

the aisles.

In CU, Tom goes to hold Summer's hand. But something happens.

It could be a total coincidence, but just as his hand

approaches hers (in SLO-MO), she moves it away and keeps it

at her side. Tom puts his hands in his pockets, unsure if

there's something to read in that.

(411)

EXT HARBOR - DAY

Tom sketches intensely. The landscape, the skyline, the

works. He's in the zone.

(240)

EXT RECORD STORE - LATER

Again, that fateful day continues. Tom and Summer outside.

Summer's resistance is futile. And the rest as they say is

history.

FADE UP: "Number Two" by the Pernice Brothers. Which plays

OVER:

(417-464)

1. INT TOM'S BATHROOM - DAY

Tom shaves. Makes himself look presentable.

LATER. Tom, now clean shaven and looking like he did when we

first met him, sketches on his bed with one hand while

holding a phone with the other.

2. EXT CITY SIDEWALK - DAY

Tom sits on a street corner drawing new additions to the

city's skyline.

2. INT LIBRARY - DAY

Tom sits with his feet up on a table, headphones on his ears,

reading one of many Taschen books on innovative building

design.

3. INT OFFICE LOBBY - DAY

Tom drops off his portfolio with the security guard in the

lobby of a high-rise.

4. EXT SOCCER FIELD - DAY

Tom and his mom and step-dad cheer on his sister playing

soccer. It's a nice temporary distraction for him.

6. INT TOM'S BEDROOM - DAY

Tom getting bad news on the phone. He has a list written on

his wall (which is now composed of a dynamic cityscape of

futuristic looking structures). He crosses "Abrams and

Abrams" off the list. We notice several others are also

crossed off.

5. EXT GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - DAY

Tom has his car on the side of the road and is out measuring

the distance between the beams of the bridge.

8. EXT PARK - DAY

Tom jogs. A little faster this time.

9. INT TOM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Tom getting more bad news from the answering machine,

crossing off yet another firm from the list. Few remain. He

sits on the bed with his shoulders slumped. For a beat, lost

in thought.

Then, as if to shut those thoughts out, whatever they were,

he turns on the TV and joylessly watches the nothingness.

9. SPLITSCREEN - DAY

On the LEFT, Tom, alone, on a bus. Looking out the window.

Thinking.

On the RIGHT, Summer. In her wedding dress. The veil is

lifted. And she's a bride.

END MUSIC.

(478)

EXT OFFICE BUILDING - ANOTHER DAY

Tom, in a suit, exits a building after another dismal

interview. We can see he is frustrated but not deterred. In

the distance, his favorite spot in the city, where he took

Summer ages ago.

EXT. PARK - DAY

Tom walks over and sits down on a bench. He stares off, lost

in thought. And then, from out of nowhere, there's her voice.

Summer sits like an apparition on a neighboring bench. She

may have just sat down, she may have been there for hours.

Tom isn't sure if she's real. He doesn't quite know what to

do.

Tom finds it hard to look at her.

The mention of their past makes the atmosphere frosty.

They both laugh a little. The tension begins to dissipate.

Awkward silence.

More awkward silence. This one goes on a beat longer. And

THEN:

Tom says nothing.

And there's not much else to say after that.

Tom gets up to leave.

Summer takes a beat to let this hang there.

And then, out of nowhere, she begins to hysterically laugh.

Tries to stop but it only makes it worse. Now's she's

completely cracking up.

And she can't stop. She's totally lost control.

Tom is speechless. Summer takes his hand. We may notice her

wedding ring. We may also notice that this is the same exact

shot as the first scene of the screenplay. We hold it for a

few seconds more. And then, the hands separate.

Summer gets up and starts walking away from him. After a

SECOND:

She stops and turns back. He takes in her face, most likely

for the last time ever.

And she walks away. The CAMERA TRACKS AWAY with her, leaving

Tom alone in the park, getting smaller and farther away every

second.

A FEW SECONDS OF BLACK, BEFORE...

(500)

INT OFFICE WAITING AREA - DAY

Tom, in a suit, with a hefty batch of architecture sketches

at his side, waits in the foyer of Allen, Prince, and Gethers

Architecture. From the room we can tell this firm is big

time.

Tom waits.

We notice, before he does, a VERY CUTE GIRL sitting in a

another chair, also waiting. She smiles. He smiles back.

They both laugh. There's a silence for a few beats. And it's

during this time that something weird comes over Tom and we

can visibly see it in his face. He likes the look of this

girl. This girl is cute. He'd like to talk more with her.

And, honestly, he's a little surprised by it.

A MAN comes out.

He starts to go. But halfway through the doorway, he pauses

and looks back at the girl.

ANIMATION. 1 second clip of the colored sequence. Real fast.

Hardly noticeable. But it's there.

Tom turns back around.

He turns back around and shakes that off, tries to refocus on

the task at hand. A job interview. And then he hears.

Tom turns back around.

She laughs. She's cute when she laughs.

She puts out her hand to meet his. They shake.

And on his face...
