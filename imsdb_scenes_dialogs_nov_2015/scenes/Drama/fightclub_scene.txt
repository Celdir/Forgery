SCREEN BLACK

FADE IN:

INT.  SOCIAL ROOM - TOP FLOOR OF HIGH RISE -- NIGHT

TYLER has one arm around Jack's shoulder; the other hand

holds a HANDGUN with the barrel lodged in JACK'S MOUTH.

Tyler is sitting in Jack's lap.

They are both sweating and disheveled, both around 30; Tyler

is blond, handsome; and Jack, brunette, is appealing in a

dry sort of way.  Tyler looks at his watch.

Jack tongues the barrel to the side of his mouth.

Tyler checks his watch.

Jack turns so that he can see down -- 31 STORIES.

PULL BACK from Jack's face.  It's pressed against TWO LARGE

BREASTS that belong to...BOB, 45, a moose of a man.  Jack is

engulfed by Bob in an intense embrace.  Bob weeps openly.

PULL BACK to wide on...

INT. CHURCH MEETING ROOM - NIGHT

Men are paired off, hugging, talking in emotional tones.

Near the door, a SIGN on a stand: "REMAINING MEN TOGETHER."

Bob hugs tighter; then looks with empathy into Jack's eyes.

Jack looks at Bob.

INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Jack lies in bed, staring at the ceiling.

INT. COPY ROOM - DAY

Jack, sleepy, stands over a copy machine.  His Starbucks cup

sits on the lid, moving back and forth as the machine copies.

Other people make copies, all with Starbucks cups, sipping.

Jack picks up his cup and his copies and leaves.

INT. JACK'S OFFICE - SAME

Jack, sipping, stares blankly at a Starbucks bag on the

floor, full of newspapers and FAST FOOD GARBAGE.

Jack looks up as a pudgy man, Jack's BOSS, enters, Starbucks

cup in hand, and slides a stack of reports on Jack's desk.

Jack hides a yawn, pretends to listen.

INT. BATHROOM - JACK'S CONDO - NIGHT

Jack sits on the toilet, CORDLESS PHONE to his ear, flips

through an IKEA catalog.  There's a stack of old Playboy

magazines and other catalogs nearby.

Jack drops the open catalog on the floor.

MOVE IN ON CATALOG -- ON PHOTO of COFFEETABLE SET...

PAN TO PHOTO of ARMCHAIR...

INT. LIVING ROOM/DINING AREA/KITCHEN

The armchair APPEARS.  PAN OVER next to armchair...

The lamps APPEAR.  PAN OVER to wall...

The clock APPEARS as the shelving unit APPEARS on the wall.

A dining room set APPEARS.  Jack, the cordless phone still

glued to his ear, walks INTO FRAME and continues.

Jack opens a cabinet, takes out a plate.

He rummages through the refrigerator.  It's practically

empty.  Jack takes out a jar of mustard, opens it and uses

a butter knife to eat it.

INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

Jack, eyes puffy, face pale, sits before an INTERN, who

studies him with bemusement.

The Intern ushes Jack to the door.  They step into the...

INT. HALLWAY

The Intern walks away from Jack, picks up a chart.

The Intern moves into the other room.  Jack stares after him.

EXT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH - NIGHT

Jack heads for the front door.

INT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH MEETING ROOM - NIGHT

Jack stares at a group of men, including Bob, who are all

listening to a group member speak at a lectern.  The SPEAKER

has pale skin and sunken eyes -- he's clearly dying.

The Speaker cracks a sad smile.  Some men chuckle, happy to

lighten the mood.

The speaker breaks down, WEEPS UNCONTROLLABLY.

Jack watches.  A couple of the men go up to the speaker,

comforting him, leading him away.  A LEADER takes the stand.

Jack, uncomfortable, joins EVERYONE ELSE:

Jack looks around.  Many of the men are sniffling, sobbing.

Jack squirms in his seat.

Everyone gets out of their chairs and begins pairing-off.

Jack stands, uncomfortable.

Bob, his chin down on his chest, starts toward Jack,

shuffling his feet.

Bob takes Jack into an embrace.

Bob breaks into sobbing, putting his head on Jack's shoulder

and completely covering Jack's face.  After a long beat of

crying, Bob raises up his head, looks at Jack's NAMETAG.

They look at each other.  Slowly, Jack's eyes grow wet.

Bob pulls Jack's head back into his chest.  Jack tightens

his arms around Bob.

Jack pulls away from Bob.  On Bob's chest, there's a WET

MASK of Jack's face from how he looks weeping.

INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Jack lies sound asleep.

INT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - NIGHT

Jack moves into a "group hug" of sickly people, men and

women.  In view is a sign by the door "Free and Clear."

Jack stands with a weeping middle-aged WOMAN.  He begins to

cry along with her.  A sign by the door: "Onward and Upward."

INT. PUBLIC BUILDING CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

Everyone, including Jack, sits back in their seats, EYES

CLOSED.  The Leader speaks into a microphone.

Jack, eyes closed, is silent...

INT. CAVE - JACK'S IMAGINATION

Jack walks along, moving through an ICE CAVERN...

Jack comes upon a PENGUIN.  The penguin looks at him, cocks

his head to signal Jack forward.

The penguin jumps onto a patch of ICE and slides away.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Jack walks out a doorway, saying goodbye to people.  He

walks down the sidewalk, shining with peace.

INT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH MEETING ROOM - RESUMING

Jack's still in an embrace with Bob.

MARLA SINGER enters.  She has short matte black hair and

big, dark eyes like a character from japanese animation.

Marla looks around, raises a cigarette to her lips.

Bob and Jack stare, dumbfounded.

INT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH MEETING ROOM - LATER

Everyone paired-off.  MOVE THROUGH ROOM... FIND JACK'S FACE

as he stares... MOVE THROUGH ROOM... FIND MARLA'S FACE.

She's drinking coffee, smoking a cigarette.

INT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - NIGHT

Marla sits with the group, smoking, listening intently while

a member speaks.  Jack spies on her.

INT. CATHOLIC CATHEDRAL - NIGHT

Marla sits at the end of a row, smoking.  All the faces down

the row are turned toward her, incredulous...

Jack leans out further than the others, scornful.

INT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH MEETING ROOM - ANOTHER NIGHT

Jack watches... Marla's eyes are closed, her head on the

shoulder of the MAN she's embraced by.  She opens her eyes,

catching Jack's stare.  Jack looks away.

Marla rests her chin on the man's shoulder.  Tears roll down

her cheeks.  She wipes at them.

EXT. FIRST METHODIST CHURCH - NIGHT

Marla walks out,  The support group's dispersing.  Jack

exits amongst them.  He spots Marla walking away.

Jack stares after Marla for a long moment.  He walks away.

INT. BEDROOM - LATER

Jack, in underwear, is cross-legged on the floor, assembling

IKEA furniture, CORDLESS PHONE shouldered to his ear.

Jack gets his wallet off the floor, pulls out another card

and, MOS over the following, he reads it into the phone.

INT. MEETING ROOM - NIGHT - JACK'S IMAGINATION

CLOSE ON JACK as he CLAMPS his arms around Marla.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Jack, in pajamas, stares at Home Shopping Network on his TV.

INT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - NIGHT

Jack walks in and joins the crowd, looking around.  People

are chattering with each other.

Everyone sits in chairs.  Jack catches sight of Marla.

Taking the lectern is CHLOE, a pale, sickly girl whose skin

stretches yellowish and tight over her bones.  She wears a

head bondage.  She clears her throat.

APPLAUSE from around the room.

The LEADER gingerly takes control of the microphone.

INT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - LATER

Jack's face, eyes closed, is motionless.

INT. CAVE - JACK'S IMAGINATION

Jack finds Marla smoking a cigarette.  Marla cocks her head,

indicating whe wants him to --

INT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - RESUMING

Jack's eyes open and turn to Marla, watching her blow smoke

rings with her eyes closed.

INT. SMALL PROTESTANT CHURCH - LATER

Everyone stands and mills about, pairing-off.

Jack sees the ghastly spectre of Chloe ambling towards him.

He tries to smile.  She smiles with a twisted, dying mouth.

Chloe's eyes are eerily bright with desperation.  Jack, in

a sincere attempt at levity, chokes out:

Chloe laughs, a little too much.  Jack squeezes out a laugh.

Then he sees Marla, off by herself.  Someone heads for her.

Jack gives a quick nod to Chloe and darts towards Marla.

Chloe watches him go.

STAY ON JACK AND MARLA as Jack CLAMPS his arms around her.

He whispers into her ear.

Marla puts her head down on Jack's shoulder as if she were

crying.  Jack pulls her head back up.  She deadpans at him.

Brief recognition between them, broken as the Leader passes.

Jack waits till the Leader's out of earshot.

Jack sighs, then pulls back.

Marla starts out of the room.  Jack follows her.

EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

Marla gets to the sidewalk, moving quickly along.

Jack follow Marla into...

Marla walks with authority up to an unwatched DRYER.  She

takes out clothes, picks out jeans, pants and shirts.

Marla gathers the chosen garments and heads out past Jack...

EXT. SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS

Jack follows, bewildered.

HONK!  Jack starts.  Marla's led him into the street with

traffic barreling down.

Marla walks on, oblivious as CARS screech to a halt, HORNS

BLARING.  Jack dashes, following...

INT. THRIFT STORE - CONTINUOUS

Marla drops the pile of clothes on a counter.  An old CLERK

sifts through the clothes, begins writing on a pad.

Marla steps down hard on Jack's foot.  He winces in pain.

The Clerk starts to ring up the assessed amounts.

The Clerk gives a strange look as he hands money to Marla.

They shake.  Jack tries to withdraw his hand; Marla holds it.

She walks to the door, pocketing money, not looking back.

Jack watches her go.  A moment, then he follows after...

EXT. SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS

Jack hesitates, unsure, then run/walks to catch up to her...

Jack takes out a business card, writes his number on the

back, hands it to her.  She takes the pen, grabs his hand

and writes her number on his palm.  She walks into the

street, causing more SCREECHING and HONKING.  She turns,

holds up the card.

Jack starts to answer, but the traffic noise is too loud.

Marla just shakes her head, turns, and keeps moving.  A BUS

moves into view, obscuring her.

INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - DAY

The plane touches down; the cabin BUMPS.  Jack's eyes open.

INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - DAY

Jack snaps awake again, looking around, disoriented.

CONVERSATION, we MOVE IN ON Jack's tray.  An ATTENDANT'S

HANDS set coffee down with a small container of cream.

HANDS place a dinner tray down.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - NIGHT

Jack brushes his teeth in the MIRROR.

Jack picks up an individual, wrapped Q-TIP, looks at it.  He

moves out of the bathroom into...

MAIN ROOM

Jack sits on the bed.  He turns on the TV.  It's tuned to

the "Sheraton Channel," shows WAITERS serving people in a

large BANQUET ROOM.  Jack stops brushing his teeth, feels

something on the bed, lifts it -- a small DINNER MINT.

INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - IN FLIGHT - NIGHT

Jack sits next to a frumpy WOMAN.  They chat.  Jack turns to

look at his food, takes a bite.  He turns back and it's...

--a BALD MAN next to him, talking.  Jack takes another bite,

turns back and it's...

--a BUSINESSMAN next to him.  Jack takes another bite, turns

back, and it's...

--a BUSINESS WOMAN next to him.

INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - LANDING

Jack's eyes snap open.

INT. WAREHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

A giant corrugated METAL DOOR opens.

Two TECHNICIANS lead Jack to the BURNT-OUT SHELL of a

WRECKED AUTOMOBILE.  Jack sets down his briefcase, opens it

and starts to make notes on a CLIPBOARDED FORM.

INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - MOVING DOWN RUNWAY

Jack is speaking to the BUSINESSWOMAN next to him.

Turgid silence.  Jack turns to the window.  He sees a

PELICAN get SUCKED into the TURBINE.

Jack's face remains bland during the following: the plane

BUCKLES -- the cabin wobbles.  People panic.  Masks drop.

The side of the plane SHEARS OFF!  Screaming PASSENGERS are

sucked out into the night air, flying past the quivering

wind.  Magazines and other objects fly everywhere.

Jack remains in his same position, same bland expression.

DING! -- the seatbelt light goes OUT.  Jack SNAPS AWAKE.

EVERYTHING IS NORMAL.  Some passengers get out of their

seats.  From next to Jack, a VOICE we've heard before...

Jack turns to see TYLER.  Without turned to Jack, Tyler

continues:

Tyler turns to Jack.

Tyler offers his hand.  Jack takes it.

Tyler grabs a safety instruction CARD from the seatback,

hands it to Jack.

Tyler points to passive faces on the drawn figures.

Jack laughs.

Jack laughs.  Tyler reaches under the seat in front of him

and lifts a BRIEFCASE.

Jack points to his own briefcase.

Tyler turns the top of his briefcase toward Jack.

Jack looks at Tyler, then pops the latches and raises the

lid to reveal quaintly-wrapped bars of SOAP.

Tyler hands Jack his card.  "THE PAPER STREET SOAP COMPANY."

Tyler SNAPS the briefcase shut.  Jack stares.

Tyler stares back.  Jack, enjoying his own chance to be

witty, leans closer to Tyler.

Tyler stands, looks towards the aisle.

Tyler moves to the aisle, his ass toward jack, walks away...

Tyler goes to the curtain dividing First Class, slaps the

curtain aside and sits in an empty seat.  Jack watches.

INT. BAGGAGE CLAIM AREA - NIGHT

Utterly empty of baggage.  No people except for Jack and a

SECURITY TASK FORCE MAN.  The Security TFM, smirking, holds

a receiver to his ear from an official phone on the wall.

Jack sees, through the window, Tyler, at the curb, throwing

his briefcase into the back of a shiny, red CONVERTIBLE.

Tyler leaps over the door into the driver's seat and PEELS

OUT.  jack turns away, looks at the Security TFM.

In the background, a HARRIED MAN dashes after Tyler and the

convertible, SCREAMING.

EXT. EMPTY RUNWAY

A lone SUITCASE sits on the concrete.  SECURITY PERSONNEL

keep their distance.  KABOOM!  The suitcase explodes.

INT. BAGGAGE CLAIM AREA - RESUMING

The Security TFM, shakes his head, hangs up.

The Security TFM hands Jack a claim form.  Jack snatches it,

disgusted, takes out a pen, starts filling out the form.

INT. TAXI - MOVING - NIGHT

Along a residential street.  Jack looks ahead, sees a tall,

grey, bland BUILDING on the corner.

The taxi turns a corner and Jack sees the front of the

building.  A diffuse CLOUD of SMOKE wafts away from a BLOWN-

OUT SECTION of the fifteenth floor.  FIRETRUCKS, POLICE CARS

and a MOB are all crowded around the lobby area.

EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF BUILDING

Jack, gaping at the sight above him, absently gives the

Cabbie money.  The taxi pulls away.  Jack starts toward the

building.  He pushes through the fray of people, into the...

INT. LOBBY

The DOORMAN sees Jack enter, gives a sad smile, shakes his

head.  Jack starts for the elevator.

Jack presses the button.  The Doorman moves next to him.

The elevator doors open.  Jack hesitates.  The doors close.

Jack heads out the lobby doors.  The Doorman follows...

EXT. CONDO BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

Jack walks past SMOKING, CHARRED DEBRIS -- a flash of ORANGE

from the Yang table, a CLOCK FACE from the hall clock, part

of an arm from the GREEN ARMCHAIR.  His feet CRUNCH glass.

Jack comes to his REFRIGERATOR lying on its side.  He

reaches down and takes a note: "MARLA --" and a phone

number, from under a BANANA MAGNET.

CLOSE SHOT - JACK'S STOVE

Hissing.

EXT. PAYPHONE - RESUMING

Jack gets to a PAYPHONE.  The Doorman follows, watching him.

Jack picks up the receiver, puts in a quarter.  He looks at

Marla's number a long moment.

CLOSE SHOT - JACK'S ENTIRE CONDO - KITCHEN AND LIVING ROOM

The SOUND of the HISS...

EXT. PAYPHONE - RESUMING

Jack replaces the receiver.  He pockets Marla's number, digs

out a small FILOFAX.  He flips through the pages for phone

numbers and addresses.  Most of the pages are blank.

INSERT - CLOSE ON THE BASE OF JACK'S REFRIGERATOR

Click.  KABOOM!  SCREEN GOES WHITE.

EXT. PAYPHONE - RESUMING

Jack looks at the Doorman.  Tyler's BUSINESS CARD falls from

the Filofax.  Jack catches it.

The Doorman walks away.  Jack stares at Tyler's card.

Jack re-deposits the quarter, dials Tyler's number.  It

RINGS... and RINGS and RINGS.  Jack sighs and hangs up the

phone.  A moment, then the phone RINGS.

EXT. LOU'S TAVERN - NIGHT

A small building in the middle of a concrete parking lot.

INT. LOU'S TAVERN - SAME

Jack and Tyler sit in the back, with a pitcher of BEER.

Tyler lights a cigarette.

Tyler offers cigarettes.  Jack declines.

Freeze picture.

INT. PROJECTIONIST ROOM - THEATRE - NIGHT

Jack, in the foreground, FACES CAMERA.  In the BACKGROUND,

Tyler sits at a bench, looking at individual FRAMES cut from

movies.  Near him, a PROJECTOR rolls film.

Tyler points to the side of OUR FRAME and the TWO DOTS

briefly APPEAR ONSCREEN.

In the AUDIENCE, CHILDREN suddenly start squirming,

confused, looking at each other.

A WOMAN abruptly stops sucking her soda straw, feeling

vaguely terrible.  Her uncomfortable HUSBAND slowly leans

back in his seat.

Jack and Tyler watch from the projection booth window.

Tyler moves around one of many tables, setting down SOUP

BOWLS.  Jack stands in the same position, FACING CAMERA.

INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - NIGHT

Jack turns and WE PAN to Tyler, standing by a CART with a

giant SOUP TUREEN.  His hands are at his open fly and he's

in position to piss into the soup.

Jack waits.  The SOUND of a STREAM of LIQUID is HEARD.

EXT. PARKING LOT OF TAVERN - RESUMING

Tyler and Jack come out the back door.

Jack stares at him.

Jack swings a wide, clumsy roundhouse -- hits Tyler's

neck -- makes a dull, flat sound.

Tyler shoots out a straight punch to Jack's chest.  Jack

falls back against a car.  His eyes tear up.

Jack swings another roundhouse that slams right under

Tyler's ear.  Tyler punches Jack in the stomach.  Tyler and

Jack move clumsily, throwing punches.  They breathe heavier,

drooling saliva and blood, growing dizzier from every impact.

EXT. CURBSIDE - LATER

Jack and Tyler sit on the curb, watching sparse headlights

on the nearby freeway.  Their eyes are glazed with endorphin-

induced serenity.  They look at each other, laugh.  Look away.

Jack thinks.

A long pause as Jack studies Tyler's face.

Another pause.  Jack feels his bleeding lip, smiles.

Tyler cracks a smile, give a sidelong glance to Jack.

EXT. PAPER STREET - NIGHT

A street sign: "PAPER STREET."  A PAPER MILL stis on one

side, facing a lone HOUSE on the other.  The rest of the

Tyler tosses his article in a pile of other articles,

chooses another magazine.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

A SLIDE SHOW progresses, run by a chipper salesman, WALTER.

Jack sits, deadpan, with a PUFFY LIP and a BRUISED cheek.

Boss gives Jack a dubious look.  Walter's next SLIDE: a

COMPUTER SCREEN.

Walter continues, his sales pitch drowned out by Jack's V.O.:

Walter moves to Jack and slaps him in the shoulder.

Jack smiles.  His teeth are RED with BLOOD.  They GLOW

eerily in the dim light.

Jack keeps the smile frozen on his face.

EXT. LOU'S TAVERN - NIGHT

Out of silent darkness, HEADLIGHTS appear from all

directions.  CARS PULL UP and park in the already-packed

lot.  YOUNG MEN get out and march into the tavern...

INT. LOU'S TAVERN - SAME

The men, including Jack and Tyler, enter and stand against

the back wall, waiting.  The bartender, IRVINE, calls out:

Irvine flicks on the LIGHTS.  Drunken customers squint and

get the message.  They plop down money, leaving.

Irvine hits a button and the JUKEBOX loses power.  Members

of the waiting army begins to share secret looks.  Finally,

one buy locks the door.  Two other guys close the blinds.

INT. TAVERN BASEMENT - SAME

A BOMB-SHELTER.  Concrete walls.  One BARE BULB above, Tyler

standing directly beneath it.

The guys mill around, finding partners.  Everyone brims with

eagerness, but tries to act cool.  CHATTER gets LOUDER.

Everyone spreads out, forming a circle, Tyler at center.

PEAKING CHATTER, till Tyler raises his arms and the CHATTER

DIES.  A couple of COUGHS, FEET SHUFFLING, then, SILENCE.

Tyler steps back.  A short guy, RICKY, and a GOATEED MAN

take off shirts and shoes and step to the center.

The two fighters circle, then begin throwing PUNCHES...

Harder, faster PUNCHES between the two.  SWEAT flies.

SHOUTS become DEAFENING.  Ricky's getting the best of

Goateed Man, POUNDING him...

Jack, eating lunch, watches the BROKEN-NOSED WAITER with a

Jack, playing SOLITAIRE on his computer, daubs blood from

his mouth with a handkerchief.  Boss, passing by the

Jack keeps playing Solitaire.  Boss enters, folds his arms.

Jack looks at Boss.  Reflexively, Jack's tongue plays with

his teeth.

EXT. STREET - DUSK

Tyler and Jack walk, both smoking cigarettes.

They reach a BUS STOP as a BUS arrives, tossing their

cigarettes, getting on board...

INT. BUS - DUSK

The bus is crowded.  As Tyler and Jack walk toward the back,

Jack studies the faces of OTHER PASSENGERS...

They hold hand grips.  Jack looks up at an ADVERTISEMENT; a

CALVIN KLEIN ad featuring a tan, bare-chested MUSCLE STUD.

Tyler looks at Jack, looks at the C.K. advertisement.

A MAN in a suit KNOCKS Tyler's shoulder as he passes.  The

Man takes a handle, close by.  Jack's pissed, staring at the

man, who stares back.

Tyler looks to Jack, glances over his shoulder at the Man.

Tyler casually picks a small scab off Jack's nostril.

Tyler stares forward.

INT. TAVERN BASEMENT - NIGHT

Tyler HITS the floor, stomach first.  HIS OPPONENT lands on

top of him, grappling, trying for a CHOKE HOLD.  The

surrounding CROWD, Jack included, SCREAMS at them...

Tyler and the Opponent wrestle desperately, and Tyler flips

his attacker, gets on top, sprawling to pin him.  Tyler

turns -- starts reining PUNCHES into the Opponent's GROIN...

Jack lands a couple of BLOWS to HIS OPPONENT'S stomach --

brings up a left uppercut that smashes the Opponent's jaw.

Tiny spatters of BLOOD adorn the walls, along with sweat.

Jack catches sight of a swollen-faced Tyler, watching

appreciatively, a smile growing slowly on his face.

The Opponent recovers, throws a headlock on Jack.  Jack

snakes his arm into a counter headlock.  They wrestle like

wild animals.  The crowd CHEERS maniacally.

Onlookers kneel to stay with the fight, cheering LOUDER.

The Opponent SMASHES Jack's head to the floor, over and over.

Everyone moves in as the Opponent steps away.  Tyler pushes

through the crowd.  Others lift Jack up.  They turn their

attention to the floor, to a BLOOD MASK of Jack's face --

similar to the TEAR MASK on BOB'S SHIRT.

Jack limply shakes his Opponent's hand.

Everyone helps Jack walk.  He's sweating, bleeding, smiling.

INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT

A NURSE tends to Jack while Tyler watches.

The Nurse doesn't look at Tyler, just keeps tending to Jack.

INT. PAPER ST. HOUSE - BATHROOM - MORNING

Tyler and Jack share the cracked MIRROR.  Tyler's clipping

at his hair with blunt, ill-suited SCISSORS.  Jack's

brushing his teeth, spitting out pink foam.

Jack reaches in his mouth, exploring, pulls -- yanks a

TOOTH.  Jack looks at it.  Tyler puts scissors down, done.

Jack drops the tooth in the sink with Tyler's hair.

Jack enters, buttoning his shirt.  The PHONE RINGS.

INTERCUT WITH...

INT. MARLA'S BUILDING, HALLWAY - SAME

Marla's in the HALL, on the PAYPHONE, twisting the phone

cord around her neck.

Jack looks through the archway and sees Tyler, in his gummy

flannel bathrobe, doing sit-ups.  Jack leans, cups the phone.

Jack looks exasperated, turns TO LOOK INTO THE CAMERA.

Jack puts the handset on top of the phone, still off the

hook, walks out the back door.

Thru the archway: Tyler leans to look in, curious.

INT. BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

GRUNTS of PLEASURE and EXERTION.  Glimpses of TORSOS, ASSES,

LEGS, ARMS, BREASTS, and FEMALE HAIR, all DRENCHED in SWEAT.

Sheets RIP.  Bodies hit the FLOOR.  Insane GRUNTING and

LAUGHING.  A flash of MARLA'S FACE.

Jack sits up in bed, looks around the room.

INT. 2ND FLOOR LANDING

Jack steps out of his room.  The neighboring door is closed.

INT. BATHROOM - SAME

Jack stares into the TOILER, looking at SIX USED CONDOMS.

INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

Jack sits at the table, sips coffee, read Reader's Digest.

He hears FOOTSTEPS approaching.

Marla walks in, straightening her dress, looks like she's

been raped by a hurricane.  Jack's jaw drops.

Marla goes to pour coffee.  She takes a swig, GARGLES and

SPITS it in the sink.  She gives Jack a lascivious smile.

Marla stares at him a beat, then drops the cup in the sink.

Marla shoves open the door to the backyard and walks out.

Jack gets up, watches her stomp away.

Jack turns and -- Tyler is at his shoulder, staring after

Marla.  He's in his usual sweatpants.  He grins at Jack,

then moves away, pours himself coffee.  Jack, smoldering,

slumps at the table and picks up Reader's Digest.  Tyler

puts his foot on a countertop, does stretching exercises.

Jack pretends to read, quickly glances at Tyler.  TYLER'S

VOICE FADES...

INT. KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON (FLASHBACK)

Tyler enters, gently lifts the handset and listens.

Tyler smiles.

INT. MARLA'S - 8TH FLOOR LANDING - LATE AFTERNOON (FLASHBACK)

Tyler, a wry smile on his face, ambles up the stiars,

looking at the rotting walls.  He reaches the top of the

stairs and heads for Marla's room.  Before he can knock,

Marla's hand shoots out and grabs him...

INT. MARLA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS (FLASHBACK)

Marla pulls Tyler inside and shuts the door.  Her drugged

eyes look him over.

She staggers and sits on the bed.  She slides off, along

with the blanket and sheets, to the floor.

She tries to focus her eyes on Tyler.

Tyler studies her with cynical curiosity, looks at a DILDO

lying atop a dresser.  Marla follows his gaze.

SIRENS and vehicles SCREECHING outside can be HEARD; doors

opening and SLAMMING; running FOOTFALLS.

She gets to her feet, grabs Tyler, pulls him out the door.

INT. HALLWAY (FLASHBACK)

Marla LOCKS her door, then pulls Tyler toward the STAIRCASE.

COPS and PARAMEDICS charge up with oxygen and medical kits.

Marla and Tyler flatten against the wall to let them pass.

The rescuers keep running.

Marla yanks Tyler's arm, heading down the stairs.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

Tyler lights his cigarette.

INT. TYLER'S ROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

Tyler smokes, post-coital.  Marla puts her lips to his ear.

INT. KITCHEN - MORNING (RESUMING)

Tyler laughs, shakes his head.  Jack's gripping his Reader's

Digest just a little too tight.

Tyler sits, studies Jack's face.

Tyler smokes.

Tyler pulls out a closer chair, motions to it.  Jack puts

down his Reader's Digest and moves to that chair.

Tyler fixes Jack with a friendly, but firm stare.

Tyler smiles, gets up and leaves.  Jack sits smoldering.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Jack watches TV at HIGH VOLUME.  SOUNDS of SEX from upstairs.

INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Jack lies calmly on his bed, staring at the ceiling.  Sounds

of THUMPS and CRASHES from beyond the wall.

INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

SOUNDS of RAIN.  Jack flips FUSES off, then walks upstairs.

INT. 2ND FLOOR LANDING - SAME

Jack walks, HEARS Marla SCREAM in orgasm.  He reaches the

landing.  Tyler's door is ajar.  Jack peeks in...

Marla's legs are sprawled on the bed.  The door PUSHES OPEN

WIDER -- Tyler, naked, stands CLOSE TO CAMERA.

Jack steps back.

Tyler scratches his head, wears a RUBBER GLOVE.

Jack continues toward his room.

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

Jack brushes his teeth.

CLOSE UP - COMPUTER MONITOR

Haiku is BEING TYPED in a trendy, italicized font.

INT. JACK'S OFFICE - DAY

Jack's clothes are PERMANENTLY STAINED with BLOOD.  He sits

in Zen pose, cigarette in mouth, finishes typing Haiku.

He hits "SEND," gets the "ERROR CHIME" SOUND.  He presses

this key over and over.  Boss enters.

Boss stares at Jack like he's from Mars.

INT. HALLWAY - SAME

Jack's leaving, looks like a war casualty, passing COWORKERS

who coldly stare at him.  His face is totally passive.

EXT. PAPER STREET - SUNSET

Jack walks toward the HOUSE.

INT. TYLER'S KITCHEN - SUNSET

Jack walks in.  SOUNDS of VIOLENT SEX and a POLAROID CAMERA

from upstairs.  Pieces of PLASTER fall from the ceiling.

Jack rolls his eyes, takes off his pants.  He runs water in

the sink, finds a tiny bit of SOAP and scrubs at the blood

stains.  The PHONE RINGS.  He answers it.

INTERCUT WITH...

INT. POLICE STATION - OFFICE

A cop, DETECTIVE STERN, refers to a file.

Jack starts to sweat, scrubs his pants obsessively.

Jack almost leaps out his skin, startled; looks to see Tyler

standing right next to him.

Jack pushes Tyler away, cups the receiving.

END INTERCUT

Jack hangs up.  Tyler shrugs.

Jack turns away, continues to scrub his pants.  Marla's

FOOTSTEPS can be HEARD coming downstairs...

Jack really grinds the soap against the pants, splashing

water.  He turns, sees Marla enter.  Tyler is GONE.  Marla

lights a cigarette.

Marla begins a slow, exotic dance, moving very close to

Jack.  She lifts her dress dangerously high, dancing close

to Jack's body, almost touhcing.

Jack becomes very aware of having no pants on, presses

against the counter.  Marla pulls her hemline further up.

She leans in very close to Jack's ear, whispers hoarsely:

Jack takes a step away, keeps scrubbing.  Marla blows smoke

in his face.  Jack takes her cigarette and throws it in the

sink.  Marla backs away, fed up, storms out, going UPSTAIRS.

Jack turns to see Tyler in the doorway.

Marla's FOOTSTEPS are coming DOWNSTAIRS.  Jack looks to the

archway, then back at -- Tyler's GONE.  Marla enters, shoes

and balled up clothing under one arm, looking for something

on the junk strewn table.

Marla ignores, still searching the table, tossing things,

pushing other things off to the floor.

Marla finds what she wanted, a pack of cigarettes.  She

moves up into Jack's face.

She laughs, spins on her heels.  As she exits the back door,

she sings "This Merry-Go-Round" from "Valley of the Dolls."

Jack watches her through the kitchen window.

Jack turns.  Tyler's right behind him.  Through the window,

Marla can be seen walking away.  Tyler picks up the remnant

of SOAP Jack's been using, holds it up to Jack.

Jack looks at Tyler.

CLOSE UP - SIGN: "DANGER - BIOHAZARD."

EXT. FENCED-IN BIOHAZARD WASTE DUMP SITE - NIGHT

Tyler stands inside the fence.  Jack's atop the fence,

struggling to cross BARBED WIRE.  He wobbles, gets over,

snags his shirt.  Jack falls, RIPPPPP.  Tyler helps.

FOOTSTEPS.  A FLASHLIGHT BEAM.  Tyler pulls Jack behind a

DUMPSTER, one of DOZENS.  A silhouette of a SECURITY GUARD

moves along the perimeter, flashlight first.  He walks away.

MOVE BACK to Tyler and Jack, who emerge from hiding.  Tyler

eagerly grabs the lid of the closest dumpster.

Tyler lifts the lid -- it CREAKS.

From the dumpster, Tyler pulls out an industrial-sized,

thick plastic bag full of PINK GOO.

TIME CUT: Tyler and Jack climb back over the fence, carrying

BAGS of fat.  One of Jack's bags RIPS, spilling the goo down

the chain-link fench.  Jack slips and slides.  Tyler laughs.

Tyler tries to scoop the running fat back into the bag.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

Jack and Tyler each stir a boiling pot.

Tyler sticks a spoon into a pot, lifts up a scoop of the

glycerin layer.  Then, he crabs a can, opens it.

Tyler licks his lips until they're gleaming wet.  He takes

Jack's hands and KISSES the back of it.

The saliva shines in the shape of the kiss.  Tyler pours a

bit of the flaked lye onto Jack's hand.

Jack's whole body JERKS.  Tyler holds tight to Jack's hand

and arm.  Tears well in Jack's eyes; his face tightens.

Jack looks -- the burn is swollen, glossy, in the shape of

Tyler's kiss.  Jack's face spasms.

SHOT OF A GREEN MAPLE LEAF, GLISTENING WITH DEW.  RESUME:

Tyler looks at Jack's glazed and detached eyes.

Jack, snapping back, tries to jerk his hand away.  Tyler

keeps hold of it and their arms KNOCK UTENSILS off the table.

Tyler JERKS Jack's hand, getting Jack's attention...

Jack's eyes glaze over again.  Jack speaks, whiny from pain:

SHOT OF A GREEN FOREST WITHOUT RAIN.  RESUME:

Tyler SLAPS Jack's face, regaining his attention...

SHOT OF TREES ENGULFED BY A FOREST FIRE.  RESUME:

SHOT OF EMBERS POURING FROM THE HELLISH FOREST FIRE.  RESUME:

MOUTH - JACK COUGHS.  RESUME:

Jack is a wide-eyed zombie...

Jack looks at Tyler -- they lock eyes.  Jack does his best

to stifle his spasms of pain, his body a quivering, coiled

knot.  He bolts toward the sink, but Tyler holds on.

Jack spasms with a shiver of pain...

Tyler shows Jack a LYE-BURNED KISS SCAR on his own hand.

Tears begin to drip from Jack's eyes.  Tyler grabs a bottle

of VINEGAR -- pours it over Jack's wound.

Jack closes his eyes, holds his hand... slumps to the floor.

INT. BARNEY'S - DAY

Jack and Tyler, in trench coats, looking like deaht-warmed-

over, wait as a BUYER fills out forms.

There are bars of "The Paper Street Soap Company" soap on

the counter.  Jack looks like he's half-expecting to get

arrested.  His hand is BANDAGED.

INT. JACK'S OFFICE - DAY

Jack sits at his desk, playing a game on his computer,

smoking a cigarette.  Boss enters.

Boss slaps a piece of PAPER down on Jack's desk.

Jack snuffs his cigarette in an ashtray, stares up stoically.

Jack rises slowly, walks to his door, shuts it.

Jack moves very close to Boss, picks up the PAPER and starts

tearing it into pieces.

Jack puts the PAPER in his trash.  Bass stares with a tinge

of outrage, a tinge of fear.  PHONE RINGS.  Jack answers it.

Boss goes to the door, stares at Jack a beat, then leaves.

INTERCUT WITH - CLOSE UP OF MARLA...

Jack walks down the sidewalk, seeing Marla take two BOXES

Jack awkwardly puts his bandaged hand behind his back.

INT. MARLA'S ROOM - NIGHT

Marla stands facing a MIRROR with her shirt open.  Jack

stands behind her with his hand on the bottom side of her

breast.  Marla's hand guides his.

Jack's head is behind Marla's.  They speak softer, slower.

Marla turns around and faces him, begins to button her shirt.

Jack touches his own chest, shakes his head.

Marla leans to kiss him -- lingers for a bit longer than

just friendly.  Jack pulls away.

Marla sighs.

EXT. HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER

Jack emerges from the lobby.  He looks up at Marla's window,

watches her silhouette.  He walks away, right into -- Big

BOB, the moose, eating a donut and drinking orange juice.

An intense look of born-again fervor comes over Bob's face.

Bob roughly slaps Jack's shoulder.

INT. BASEMENT - ELECTRONICS WKREHOUSE - NIGHT

The CROWD SCREAMS insanely as Bob and Jack go at it in the

circle of light.  Bob's eyes are wild with glee.

EXT. BASEMENT DOOR - ELECTRONICS WAREHOUSE - LATER

Everyone sneaks out of this new location - we've seen none

of these guys before - it's a new chapter.  Jack and Bob

Stagger out last, Jack being in worse shape.  They both grin

with religious serenity.  Bob hugs Jack.

Bob relaxes the hug and Jack drops to the ground like a

sack, completely enervated from the beating he took.

INT. KITCHEN -- MORNING

Jack has his briefcase on the table, looks at PAPERWORK.

Tyler wanders in, carries a dirty pot to the sink.  Jack

takes out a cigarette, lights up.  He offers the pack...

Tyler scratches his chin absently.

Tyler walks out the way he came.

INT. JACK'S OFFICE - DAY

Jack sits staring at his SCREEN SAVER.

INT. BOSS'S OFFICE - DAY

Jack steps into the open doorway, knocks on the doorframe.

Boss looks up from his large, expensive desk.

Boss sits up in his seat, becoming enraged.

Boss stands, moves around his desk, glaring with rage.

Jack PUNCHES HIMSELF in the nose.  Blood starts to trickle.

He punches himself in the jaw, throws himself back as if by

the force of the punch, SLAMS against a framed picture and

SHATTERS the glass.  He falls to the floor.

Jack gets back to his feet.

He PUNCHES himself in the stomach, then in the jaw again.

He reels backwards, pulls down a hanging shelf, its contents

flying.  He hits the floor.

Jack crawls toward Boss, dripping blood, grabs Boss's leg.

Jack climbs up Boss's leg while Boss tries to shake him off.

Boss stumbles back into his desk, knocking off belongings.

Jack crawls high enough to grab Boss's belt, hoisting

himself up.  He dribbles blood an Boss's clothing, SMUDGES

blood from his face onto the knuckles of Boss's hand.

Two SECURITY GUARDS enter and gape at the sight.  Behind

them stand CURIOUS WORKERS, looking in.

INT. TYLER'S HOUSE - ENTRANCE FOYER - DAY

Jack holds a CHECK in front of Tyler's face.

Jack digs in his pocket, takes out a thick bundle of CARDS.

Jack holds up a finger, going to open the front door.  He

drags an unwieldy SHOPPING CART in behind him; filled with

his COMPUTER, PHONE, FAX and other office equipment.

Jack looks at the cart, then back at Tyler, proud.

INT. LOU'S TAVERN - BASEMENT - NIGHT

LOUD.  An enormous CROWD of guys, including Jack and Bob,

stands around Tyler, who's in the center of the circle,

holding up his hands to quiet them...

An enthusiastic RUMBLE from the crowd.

A glum silence falls.  Guys look at each other.

The crowd erupts into a DEAFENING CHORUS of agreement.  Jack

looks at the blazing excitement in the eyes of the crowd.

A fat, MIDDLE-AGED MAN stomps down the stairs, pushing into

the crowd, followed by a TALL, HEFTY THUG who holds a GUM.

Tyler extends his hand for a shake, but Lou SLAPS it away.

Everyone glances guiltily at each other.

Lou SLUGS Tyler in the stomach, doubles him over.

Tyler gains his breath, determined.  He looks up, turns his

head, looking to Jack.  Jack watches, wide-eyed.

Tyler straightens, facing Lou.

Lou PUNCHES Tyler in the face.  Some of the guys move

forward, but the Thug points his gun.  Jack-runs forward

anyway -- Lou PUNCHES him in the face.

More guys move forward, but Tyler waves them off, facing Lou.

Lou proceeds to beat the shit out of Tyler, PUNCHING his

face, his stomach.  Tyler collapses to the floor.  Lou

starts KICKING his.  Tyler bleeds from the mouth and face.

Lou flushes red with exasperation, KICKS more.  Finally,

sweating, bewildered, Lou stops.  He looks to the Thug, who

is just as bewildered.

Suddenly, Tyler SPRINGS UP, grabs onto Lou...

Tyler's blood spatters on Lou.  Lou tries to shake Tyler

off, but Tyler BITES Lou's NECKTIE.  The Thug grabs Tyler

and pulls, the necktie tightening and strangling Lou.  Lou

slaps at Tyler's face, but recoils from the blood.  Tyler

spits and shouts through clenched teeth...

Tyler bear hugs Lou, pulls him to the floor.  Tyler rubs his

bloody face into Lou's face.  The Thug lifts Tyler.  Tyler

clings to Lou's belt, dragging Lou as he is dragged...

Blood dribbles out of Tyler's mouth, spattering Lou.

Tyler lets go of Lou's belt.  Lou scrambles away.  The Thug

drops Tyler, trying to keep clear of the blood.  Lou gets to

his feet, looks at Tyler, then at the rest of the guys.  He

and the Thug back away... slamming the door behind.

Fight club surrounds Tyler.  They help him up, move him to

a crate.  Tyler sits slumped for a long moment, his

breathing labored... then, he sits back, crossing his legs

and looking to the group, his demeanor businesslike.

Jack beams in appreciation.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Ricky trips a passing YUPPIE.  The Yuppie falls.

The Yuppies gets up, angry, and Ricky PUNCHES him...

Having no recourse, the Yuppie begins trading blows.

EXT. AUTO SHOP - DAY

A MECHANIC WITH A BATTERED FACE uses a hose to wash the

sidewalk.  As MEN pass, he jerks the hose up and SPRAYS them.

These men continue on their way.

The Mechanic sprays a third man, a SEMINARY STUDENT, who

looks down, stunned.

The Mechanic DOUSES the Seminarian.  The Seminarian grabs

the hose, wrestling the Mechanic for it.  The Mechanic

shoves the Seminarian, who responds with a half-assed PUNCH.

The Mechanic purposely takes it.  The Seminarian starts to

run away.  The Mechanic sprints after him, PUNCHING the

Seminarian in the back of the neck.  They fight.

INT. RECORD STORE STOCKROOM - NIGHT

A FIST smashes a JAW.  Guys CHEER.  An arm snakes around a

front tires EXPLODING, wheel rims throwing sparks.

Huge office.  Rows and rows of desks.  FIGHT CLUB MEMBERS

EXT. BEHIND THE CONVENIENCE STORE - MOMENTS LATER

The BACK DOOR opens and Tyler brings the store's CLERK out

at gunpoint, forces him to his knees.  Jack follows,

freaked.  Tyler points the gun at the Clerk.

The Clerk fumbles his wallet out of his pocket and Tyler

snatches it.  Tyler pulls out the DRIVER'S LICENCE.

Tyler rummages through the wallet.

Raymond begins to weep, shoulders heaving.

Tyler rams the gun barrel against Raymond's temple.

Raymond weeps and says nothing.  Tyler COCKS the gun.

Raymond GASPS.

A beat.

Tyler shoves Raymond's wallet back into Raymond's pocket.

Tyler moves the gun right between Raymond's eyes.

Tyler UNCOCKS the gun, lowers it.

Raymond staggers to his feet, heads down an alleyway.  Jack

and Tyler watch Raymond flee, then Tyler looks at Jack.

Tyler brings the gun to his own head, pulls the trigger --

Jack notices ROPE and RAPPELLING TOOLS on the table.  Tyler

Jack, bewildered, enters carrying beers.  Tyler does NOT

follow.  BOB, RICKY and several other fight club guys sit in

front at the TV, chanting not too loudly, all also dressed

in FATIGUES and splattered with PAINT.

Bob goes to turn up the TV.  One guy, sixteen years old with

an angelic face, ANGEL FACE, gets up to take beer from Jack.

Angel face starts distributing beer amongst his cohorts.

Jack looks to the TV -- it shows a LIVE shot of the "PARKER

MORRIS BUILDING."  The building has a GIANT, GRINNING FACE

PAINTED on it -- two BROKEN WINDOWS for EYES, with flames

pouring out... FIRETRUCKS spray water.

COMMISSIONER JACOBS, a wrinkled official, turns to camera.

Jack turns, sees Tyler in the archway, watching him.  Tyler

tips his beer to toast, pulls back, out of sight.

They all BURST INTO LAUGHTER.  They look at Jack and shake

their heads.  Jack doesn't get it.  Suddenly, the guys'

faces turn to stone.  Bob sits rigid.

Jack stares at them.

INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - NIGHT

A luxurious BANQUET.  Commissioner Jacobs guzzles champagne.

He rises and starts out of the room.  Jack, in a WAITER'S

UNIFORM, looks apprehensively to OTHER WAITERS: BOB...

RICKY... ANGEL FACE -- who all give each other a look.

BATHROOM -- face to face with TYLER.

INT. BATHROOM

Tyler GRABS Commissioner Jacobs, pulling him into the

bathroom.  He slaps a piece of tape over Jacobs' mouth.  The

OTHER "WAITERS" rush in.  Jack stays back to keep the door

shut.  Tyler and the others hold Jacobs, pulling down his

pants.  Bob snaps a rubber band -- reaches to Jacob s crotch.

Ricky produces a KNIFE, moves it down to Jacob's testicles.

Jacobs is bug-eyed.  Jack, red-faced, keeps his distance.

Ricky makes a dramatic cut with the knife, causing Jacobs to

JUMP -- Ricky holds up the severed RUBBER BAND.

Fight club in full swing.  Jack battles Angel Face, BEATING

the shit out of him with unprecedented viciousness.

The crowd shouts maniacally, save Tyler, who watches with an

inscrutable stone face.

Angel Face tries to speak, but Jack POUNDS too hard.  Blood

flies.  The crowd begins to grow QUIETER.

Finally, Angel Face lies still, unconscious.  Jack stops,

stares down, numb.  Jack walks away -- the crowd parts to

let him pass.  Jack scans faces... finds Tyler.

EXT. STREET NEAR LOU'S TAVERN - LATER

INT. STOLEN CAR - MOVING - LATER

RAIN GUSHES down.  Jack stews, silent.  The car moves down

a HIGHWAY, intermittently illuminated by oncoming headlights.

Tyler shrugs; turns on the RADIO, ignores Jack.

Tyler steers the car into the opposite lane, accelerates...

Opposing HEADLIGHTS get closer fast...

Tyler steers back into the proper lane.  The other CAR flies

past, HORN SOUNDING...

Tyler again steers into the oncoming lane, speeding up.

Through the windshield: oncoming headlights -- a TRUCK.

Jack fights	to turn the wheel, but Tyler uses both hands.

The oncoming truck HONKS and FLASHES its LIGHTS.  It moves

to the other side of the road.  Tyler steers there, too.

Nearing impact with the oncoming truck, Tyler takes his

hands off the wheel -- Jack keeps his grip, turns the

wheel... the car swerves...

The truck ROARS past, spraying water, HORN BLASTING.

Tyler looks at Jack, his hands in the air.  Jack looks at

Tyler with dead eyes.

Jack takes his hands off the wheel, holds them in the air.

Tyler studies Jack face, impressed.  Tyler makes no move to

take the wheel.

THROUGH THR WINDSHIELD: a STALLED CAR ahead on the side of

the road, surrounded by flares.

Jack and Tyler's eyes stay locked as the car drifts onto the

shoulder... heading for the stalled car.  Their faces are

illuminated by the light of the flares.  Tyler smiles.

They SMASH into the stalled car -- AIRBAGS INFLATE!  The

back of their car whips around and carries it into a ass-

over-tea-kettle ROLL down a hill...

The car finally hits the bottom, lying on its roof.

EXT. OVERTURNED CAR

Tyler crawls from the passenger side.  He walks around...

opens the driver's side door and drags Jack out into the

mud.  Ricky and the Mechanic climb out the broken rear

window.  Tyler sits beside the stunned, wounded Jack.

INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

Jack lies in bed, traumatized, eyes empty, staring at the

ceiling.  Tyler sits in a nearby chair.

Tyler stands, gives Jack's head a pat.

INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Jack sits at the table, sips coffee.  He's pale, dazed,

seems broken.  He hears the faint SOUND of SAWING and

HAMMERING, unsure of where it's coming from.

Marla walks into the kitchen and goes straight to the

counter.  Her back is to Jack as he looks at her.  She pours

ccffee and lights a cigarette.  A beat of silence, then:

She seems to be as weak as Jack.

Marla turns to face Jack, a grim expression on her face.

There's a BRUISE on her ARM.  Jack gets up, moves closer.

Marla looks a him, waiting.

Faint SOUND of SAWING and HAMMERING.  Jack can't quite

figure where it's coming from.

Jack turns -- through the crack of the open basement door,

Tyler's staring at Jack from the bottom of the stairs.

Jack reacts, turns back to Marla.

Marla comes to touch Jack's hair.  Jack closes the basement

door.  Marla sees the kiss-scar on Jack's hand, grabs his

hand.  Jack tries to pull it back, but Marla keeps a grip.

Marla backs away, closes her eyes, struggling with

frustration.  She leaves out the back door, not looking back.

Jack leans against the wall.  After a moment, he opens the

basement door, heads downstairs...

INT. BASEMENT STAIRCASE

Tyler walks upstairs, passing as Jack continues down...

INT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS

Jack looks around.  TRIPLE-DECKER BUNKS clutter the

basement, as many as can fit into the space.

From upstairs, the SOUND of the DOORBELL.

INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Jack opens the door.  Ricky stands on the porch, staring

ahead in subordinate military style.  He's in black pants,

black shirt, black shoes, holds a PAPER BAG, with an army

surplus MATTRESS rolled-up at his feet.

Tyler steps up beside Jack, looks Ricky over.

Tyler comes back inside, shuts the door.

EXT. PORCH - MOMENTS LATER

Jack comes out, walks around Ricky, hands in his pockets,

unsure.  Tyler watches, nods for Jack to go ahead.

No response from Ricky, who remains at attention.  Jack goes

back inside.  Tyler closes the door.

At the window, Tyler sips coffee, watches this scene on the

PORCH below.

EXT. PORCH - MORNING

Ricky's there.  Bob is now next to him, in black, with a

paper bag in hand, mattress at his feet.  Tyler steps out.

Jack stays in the doorway, locking eyes on Bob.  To all the

following questions, Ricky answers "Sir!" --

Ricky goes in.  Tyler turns to Bob.

Bob looks genuinely hurt.  He picks up his mattress and

follows Bob...

From here on, all those with shaved heads: "SPACE MONKEYS."

EXT. PORCH - DAY

Jack looks out the window.  Bob stands motionless.  There's

another "applicant," a SHORT GUY, beside Bob.  Ricky comes

out the front door with the BROOM...

Ricky HITS them with the broom, then goes in, SLAMS THE DOOR.

EXT. BACKYARD - DAY

Tyler works with a HALF DOZEN SPACE MONKEYS, preparing the

square of backyard.  They pull weeds, clear rocks; working

rocks and carry in SACKS of FERTILIZER.

IN THE KITCHEN WINDOW, Jack watches...

INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Jack keeps watching out the window, eats toast.

Jack turns to look around the kitchen.  THREE SPACE MONKEYS

SCRUBBING the walls.  Jack walks out.

The room is empty.  Jack stares.

Jack comes downstairs... finds DOZENS of SPACE MONKEYS.

INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT

Jack enters.  Space Monkeys render fat and make soap.  They

pinch HERBS, adding them to the mix.  They add VODKA.  Off

to the side, a couple Monkeys stir a vat of RICE.  On the

wall is a big bulletin board with HUNDREDS of DRIVER's

LICENSES; a sign above it: "HUMAN SACRIFICES."

Jack dips a spoon into the rice, chomps on it irritatingly.

Jack picks up a BOTTLE of VODKA.

INT. READING ROOM - NIGHT

Jack enters, vodka in hand.  TEN SPACE MONKEYS here, reading.

Jack walks out.

Jack enters.  Angel Face reads a book, marks on a chart.

Space Monkeys shuffle PAPERS and NEWS CLIPPINGS.  Walls are

lined with FILES, each labeled with a STREET ADDRESS, under

SIGNS: "Mischief," "Disinformation," "Arson."

Jack's eye lingers on "Arson." He starts flipping through

a file.  Angel Face comes to take the file from him.

As Angel Face replaces the file, Jack notices -- a LYE-

BURNED KISS-SCAR on the back of Angel Face's hand.

EXT. BACK YARD - NIGHT

Jack takes a swig of vodka, smokes.  In the BACKGROUND, a

Space Monkey WHACKS an APPLICANT with a BROOM.  It's a

ritual; no words.  Other Space Monkeys tend the garden.

Jack drops his cigarette in the gravel, steps on it.  A

Space Monkey immediately comes to clean it up.

Jack turns, sees Marla with an overnight bag.

Marla stares at Jack, miserable.  A tear runs down her

cheek.  She turns and walks away.  Jack watches her go.

There's a LOUD COMMOTION from the house, VOICES SHOUTING.

Jack heads to the back door...

INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Jack enters.  Ricky crawls, bleeding from a gunshot wound to

the LEG.  Space Monkeys begin a rudimentary job of treating

the wound.  Other Space Monkeys carry in a DEAD BODY in

BLACK CLOTHES and SKI MASK, putting it on the table.

Space Monkeys stare at the body.  The Mechanic, sweating,

gets to his knees and pulls the ski mask off the corpse --

it's BOB, with a gunshot wound to the HEAD.

Jack pushes past a Space Monkey, stares down, stricken...

EXT. SCULPTURE PARK - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)

A SCULPTURE adorned with a giant GLOBE on top.

A SERIES of EXPLOSIONS blasts the GLOBE free.  It ROLLS...

The GLOBE ROLLS downhill, to the street -- rolling over one

parked LUXURY CAR after another, crunching car roofs and

causing windows to explode...

Then, the GLOBE arrives at the lobby of a HOTEL...

BROADSIDES a limo, RICOCHETS... ROLLS directly into the

front of a closed ARROSTO coffee bar, SMASHING windows...

DECIMATING coffee push-pats...

EXT. PARK - AERIAL VIEW - (FLASHBACK CONTINUOUS)

Bob, the Mechanic and Ricky FLEE, LAUGHING at their

handiwork.  They split up, running O.S.

O.S. SOUNDS of GUNSHOTS and FLASHES of MUZZLE FIRE.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT - (RESUMING)

The Mechanic looks up from Bob's corpse.

Jack walks away from Bob's corpse, distraught, holds his

head, turns to look back, his eyes filling with tears.

Jack looks around in disbelief.

Several Space Monkeys gather around Bob's body.

Space Monkeys stop.  Jack gets between them and Bob, SHOVES

a few Space Monkeys back...

Everyone just stares at Jack.

Jack backs away, surrounded, PUSHES his way out of the room.

INT. TYLER'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Jack barges in, goes to the desk, rifling through drawers.

INT. ANOTHER BAR - DAY

Jack walks in.  The place is empty.  He walks to a KITCHEN

DOOR, opens it and peers in at... a GROUP of KITCHEN WORKERS

solemnly stand in a circle, chanting...

Jack whirls, startled -- facing the wounded BARTENDER, who

wears a NECK BRACE, his nose a smashed eggplant.

Jack nods slowly.  The Bartender holds up his hand, shows

the KISS SCAR on the back of his hand...

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Jack bursts inside, out of breath, runs to grab the phone,

punches a number, doesn't bother to turn on the lamp.

INTERCUT WITH...

mannerisms, speech...

TWO WINDOWS SHATTER OUTWARD -- TWO MEN look out and yell:

INT. HOTEL ROOM - RESUMING

Jack's having trouble catching his breath.  Tyler stands.

Jack shakes his head in disbelief, in denial...

Jack stands, trying to absorb, feeling ill, trying to find

words, then -- he suddenly FAINTS to the floor, OUT COLD.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - PRE-DAWN

Jack's eyes snap open.  He sits up, alone.  He remembers the

previous night... looks at himself in the mirror... looks at

INT. HALLWAY

The room door SLAMS OPEN as Jack bursts out of the room,

carrying his suitcase, SPRINTING for the STAIRWELL...

Jack races down, three steps at a time, dragging his

suitcase - BOOM, BOOM, BOOM - behind him...

INT. LOBBY

Jack hurries to the front door, his suitcase half-broken

open, passing the front desk.  A DESK CLERK calls after him.

The clerk follows the length of the counter, waves a PAPER.

Jack goes out the door, freezes.  He rushes back in, going

to the desk -- snatches the bill, studies it: many NUMBERS.

Jack looks at the clerk, at the bill, at the clerk.

INT. AIRPLANE CABIN - IN FLIGHT - DAY

Jack stares out the window, his face set hard.

INT. PAPER ST. HOUSE, LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Jack walks in to find the place EMPTY and DESERTED.  He

CANISTERS holding vast amounts of liquid.  There are HOSES,

GAS MASKS, BEAKERS, TEST TUBES and PUMPS.

He picks up a BOTTLE labeled "NITRIC ACID."

INT. TYLER'S ROOM

Jack sits by the PHONE, pulls out the HOTEL BILL, runs his

finger up and down the list of PHONE NUMBERS...

Jack finger stops on a NUMBER.  He dials, phone to his ear.

Jack sees a file on the wall: "1888 CENTURY PARK EAST."

Jack HANGS UP, desperately dials the next number on the bill.

Jack sees a file: "2160 PICO BOULEVARD."  He throws the

phone, pocketing the bill.  He grabs up all the FILES.

EXT. MARLA'S HOTEL - SUNSET

Jack's TAXI halts.  Marla walks out of the lobby doors, sees

Jack getting out of the cab, laden with files...

Marla makes a sharp turn, walking away.  Jack follows,

hugging the files to his chest, catching up.

Marla heads into a DINER.  Jack follows...

INT. DINER - MOMENTS LATER

Marla sits in a BOOTH.  Jack sits across from her.

A WAITER with a BLACK EYE appears at the table.

Jack look to the pass-through WINDOW into the kitchen where

THREE COOKS look out with STITCHES in their faces.

The waiter snaps to attention and leaves.

Marla's getting up to go, but Jack rises, fed up, takes her

by the arm, putting her back in her seat.

Marla crosses her arms.  Jack collects himself.

Marla's getting upset, tears coming to her eyes.

Marla gets up.  Jack grabs for her, but she's gone, heading

for the door.  Jack gathers his files, runs to follow...

EXT. DINER - MOMESTS LATER

Jack pushes out the door, files under one arm, catching up...

Jack grabs her arm, tries to hail a TAXI, but the taxi races

past.  Marla pulls free, screaming at him...,

Jack spots a BUS idling further up the street.

He pulls MONEY from his pocket, holding it out.

Marla looks at Jack, numb.

Marla takes the money from Tyler, walks towards the bus.  As

they approach it, Jack shields his eyes, afraid to look...

Marla stands at the doors of the bus, heartbroken, gives one

last look at Jack.

Jack's still covering his eyes.  Marla gets on the bus.

Jack finally looks to her.

DOORS HISS SHUT.  The BUS LEAVES, heading away.  Jack seems

relieved.  Then, a SCREAM is HEARD from MARLA...

Jack turns, looks... THROUGH THE BUS WINDOWS: the bus is

filled with BALD MEN IN BLACK: Space Monkeys.

Jack SPRINTS after the bus...

The bus speeds away.  Onboard, Space Monkeys subdue Marla.

Jack falls to the asphalt, rolls, files-flying.

INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

Jack RUNS to the front desk, crazed, dumps the armload of

files on the desk in front of the DESK SERGEANT...

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER

Detective Stern and THREE DETECTIVES stand, staring at Jack,

who's seated.  On the table are the phone bill and files.

Stern leaves.  A beat, then, the remaining Detectives smile

at Jack with REVERENCE.

They grab Jack and force him on his back on the table.

Flat-Top has a rubber band; the Bald Detective has a knife.

Flat-Top PULLS Jack's pants completely off, tosses them

aside.  Jack SCREAMS.  Flat-Top holds his legs.

A KNOCK at the door.  Flat-Top slaps a hand over Jack's

mouth.  He and Redhead block view of the table as Baldy

opens the door a crack.  Stern mutters:

Baldy glances back at the other Detectives, leaves, closing

the door.  The two remaining Detectives continue.  Jack kicks

and screams and writhes.  The Detectives wrangle him, but

with more difficulty, now that Baldy's gone.

Jack gets one leg free, KICKS, knocks Flat-top backwards --

Flat-Top SLAMS the wall, falls.  Redhead lets go of one of

Jack's arms, jams his elbow into Jack's throat... cutting

off the airway.  Jack's face reddens... he's choking...

Jack's free hand reaches, searching.. pulls Redhead's GUN

and points it at him.  Redhead backs off. Jack gets up,

gasping for air, PISTOL-WHIPS Flat-top as he rises.

Jack grabs one of the files off the table.

EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY

Jack, without pants, in BOXER SHORTS, escapes out the BACK

DOOR.  He looks at the ADDRESS on the file folder.

EXT. STREET

Jack SPRINTS down the middle of the street, gun in hand,

looking like a complete madman.  Cars almost hit him.

EXT. BANK BUILDING - LATER

Jack, sweating and panting, stops, looks... then heads

toward the BUILDING with the address "1888."

EXT. 1888 LOBBY

Jack tries the door.  Locked.  He lifts a cast iron bench,

runs forward -- RAMS it into the glass.  The bench

immediately recoils from the glass, SLAMS Jack's groin!

Jack falls to his knees, doubled over, holding his package.

Then, he rises, SHOOTS the glass...

INT. 1888 LOBBY

Jack pushes through the broken glass.  He sprints for the

"PARKING" door...

INT. GROUND LEVEL - PARKING

Jack enters, looks -- NO CARS.  He bolts to the STAIRS...

INT. TOP-LEVEL PARKING AREA - SEVENTH FLOOR

Jack enters, heaving.  Again, NO CARS.  He moves from one

SUPPORT POST to another, searching.  He finally spies,

across the garage, NINE LARGE CANISTERS, heavily-WIRED.

Jack runs to the BOMB, frantic.  He walks around it.

There's a DIGITAL CLOCK, ticking down from "10:05"...

Jack moves to pull the lid off one CANISTER, looks inside..

Jack looks -- Tyler's seated, his back against one post.

Tyler gets up walks to Jack.

Tyler keeps walking around, crosses his arms.

Jack looks back to the BOMB, goes to it, wipes sweat off his

face.  He starts finger the MANY WIRES, sorting them.

Jack holds his gun under one armpit, uses both hands to go

through the tangle of colored wires.

Jack chooses one wire, GREEN, holds it in his fingers.

Jack twists the GREEN WIRE around his finger.

Tyler comes a little closer, leaning to try to get a look,

seems genuinely concerned.

Jack's unsure, swallowing, pulling the wire taunt, fingers

trembling.  The SOUND of a VEHICLE is HEARD from below...

Jack looks to Tyler.  Tyler points towards the SOUND...

Jack releases the wire, walks to a RAILING, gun in hand,

keeps an eye on Tyler.  Jack looks over the railing...

BELOW, a BUS idles.  The doors open and MARLA'S dragged out,

kicking and screaming, carried by SIX SPACE MONKEYS...

They carry Marla into the BUILDING'S ENTRANCE.

Jack leans against the railing, exhausted.

Tyler thinks, shrugs.

Tyler's walks away.  Jack looks at the gun in his hand.  He

points the gun at Tyler...

Tyler stops walking.

Tyler strides towards the BOMB.  Jack trains the gun...

Tyler looks at the BOMB, reaches over to it.  He grips the

GREEN WIRE, yanks it out -- the CLOCK STOPS.

Jack lowers his gun.

Jack's stunned.  Tyler walks across the parking garage, past

Jack, heading for the STAIRS.

Jack aims the gun at Tyler's back, FIRES!

Tyler ducks to one side, impossibly quick, avoiding...

Tyler spins to face Jack.

Jack aims... FIRES!

Tyler DODGES behind a post as the BULLET THROWS CONCRETE.

Jack edges forward, gun held in both hands, moves around the

post... Tyler is NOT THERE.  Jack turns, takes slow steps,

moving the gun from side to side...

Suddenly, a FIST ENTERS FRAME -- SLUGS Jack's face.

Jack falls.  The gun goes CLATTERING across the floor...

Jack turns, looking... Tyler's GONE.  Jack looks to the gun,

scrambles to his feet, running to pick up the gun...

Tyler KICKS Jack in the chest, sends Jack sprawling.

Jack rolls, holding his chest.  He looks up, sees Tyler run

into the STAIRWELL.  Jack grabs the gun and follows...

INT. STAIRWELL

Jack smashes the door open.  The stairwell's empty.  Jack

RUNS up a flight of stairs, kicks open ANOTHER DOOR...

INT. MAIN LOBBY

Jack steps forward, gun up... TWO INTERLOCKED HANDS SLAM

down onto his head.  Jack drops to the floor.

Tyler backs away, laughing.  Jack gets to his feet, aims his

gun...

Jack clenches his teeth, FIRING -- nothing happens to Tyler.

Jack FIRES TWICE -- no effect.  Tyler raises his arms.

Jack charges.  Tyler dodges, PUNCHES, knocks the gun out of

Jack's hand.  They FIGHT, trading PUNCHES, grappling, taking

each other to the floor...

INT. SECURITY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Banks of SECURITY MONITORS sit unmanned.

ON ONE MONITOR: Jack is seen in the lobby, on the floor,

alone, wrestling himself.  He swings his left hand up,

punching empty air, then swings his right hand -- PUNCHING

himself in the side of the head...

INT. MAIN LOBBY

Tyler and Jack fight viciously, bloodied.  Tyler manages to

get his hands around Jack's throat, starts BANGING Jack's

head against the floor...

SECURITY MONITOR P.O.V.

... Jack's got his hands around his own throat, BANGING his

own head against the floor, over and over...

INT. MAIN LOBBY

Jack manages to break Tyler's grip, KICKS Tyler away.

Tyler springs to his feet, RUNS, heading for a STAIRCASE.

Jack gets up, breathing hard, holding his head, follows...

ON THE STAIRS, Tyler reaches the LOFT LEVEL, above the

lobby, disappears around a corner.  Jack's right behind,

turning the corner -- Tyler's NOT THERE.

Jack receives a SHARP SLAP on the back of the head.  He

wheels.  Tyler isn't there.  A TAP on his shoulder.  Jack

turns around -- WHAM! -- Tyler PUNCHES his face.  Jack falls

against the loft railing.  Tyler comes forward, SWINGS...

SECURITY MONITOR P.O.V.

Jack PUNCHES himself square in the nose!

INT. MAIN LOBBY

Jack's dazed.  Tyler grabs Jack's shirt, pulls him forward,

SWINGS HIM -- THROWS him DOWN THE STAIRS...

Jack TUMBLES horribly down... HITS BOTTOM, striking his head

on the floor.  Jack PASSES OUT...

INT. LARGE SOCIAL ROOM - TOP FLOOR

CLOSE ON: Jack's head jerks back as he SNAPS AWAKE.  He

looks around, trying to focus his eyes...

JACK'S P.O.V. -- TRACKS in the sawdust of the floor, from

where his body was dragged across to where he is how.

CLOSE ON: Jack tries to comprehend.  He turns his head --

TYLER'S HAND brings the GUN up, PUTS THE GUN IN JACK'S

MOUTH.  Jack freezes, looks around with his eyes...

Tyler is seated in Jack's lap.  Tyler holds the gun in

Jack's mouth, his arm around him.  This huge room is being

remodeled.  Tyler and Jack are seated near floor-to-ceiling

windows affording a spectacular view of the CITY.

Tyler looks at his watch.

Jack tongues the barrel to the side of his mouth.

Tyler checks his watch.

Jack turns, so he can see down -- 31 STORIES.

Tyler watches the skyline, WHISTLES at tune, waiting.

Tyler looks out the windows, at SURROUNDING BUILDINGS,

excited.  Jack closes his eyes, despairing.

Out the window, the SKYLINE remains unchanged.  Nothing.  A

long beat.  A very dark scowl comes over Tyler's face.

Jack opens his eyes.  More waiting.  Tyler looks genuinely

surprised, pissed-off.

Tyler rises, taking the gun from Jack's mouth, starts

pacing.  Jack rubs his sore jowls, allows himself a smile.

Tyler stops walking, lets out a sigh of disgust.  He reaches

into his pocket, taking out a WALKIE TALKIE.

Jack's eyes go wide.

Jack leaps -- TACKLES Tyler.  The GUN is knocked away.  Jack

STRIKES Tyler's face repeatedly with his elbow, scrambles

off...

Jack gets the gun, turns, pointing it.  Tyler's getting to

his feet, sees the gun, annoyed.  Jack stands.

Jack SHOOTS TWICE.  Bullets pass right thorough Tyler.

Tyler just rolls his eyes, drops the walkie-talkie to the

floor and STOMPS on it, CRUSHING it.

Jack falters, pointing at Tyler's feet.  There's no walkie-

talkie there.  Jack looks down, sees the WALKIE-TALKIE

CRUSHED under his own foot.

Jack holds his head, walks around, at his wit's end.

Jack backs up against a window, numb and weary.

Jack stares at Tyler, tears welling up, hangs his head.  He

looks at the gun in his hand...

Jack stares at the gun a long time... then...

Jack brings the gun up, PUTS THE GUN IN HIS MOUTH.

Tyler cocks his head.

Tyler is calm.

Tyler smiles in appreciation, slowly walks forward, stands

very close to Jack.

Jack COCKS the hammer on the gun.

Their eyes are locked, unblinking.  Long silence.

EXTREME SLOW MOTION:

Jack's finger squeezes the trigger...

KABLAM! -- Jack's cheeks INFLATE with gas.  His eyes bulge.

BLOOD flies out from his head.  The WINDOW behind him

SHATTERS.  SMOKE wafts out of his mouth and tear ducts.

RESUME NORMAL SPEED as the GLASS FALLS behind Jack...

Tyler stands, in gunsmoke, eyes glazed, sniffs the air...

Jack slumps to the floor... Tyler falls...

Tyler hits the ground.  The back of TYLER'S HEAD is BLOWN

OPEN, revealing blood, skull and brain.

Suddenly, a GROUP of SPACE MONKEYS burst into the room,

moving forward to Jack.  TYLER'S BODY IS GONE.

Jack quakes, holding the side of his head; a ragged hole

blown in his CHEEK.  He's bleeding hard, but he's alive.

Jack looks to the Space Monkeys, trying to get his eyes to

see.  TWO SPACE MONKEYS enter with Marla.  One holds a gun

to Marla as she struggles.

Jack sees Marla, tries to get to his feet, falls...

The Monkeys bring Marla, releasing her, saluting.

Marla crouches, takes out wadded TISSUES and tries to apply.

them to Jack's wound.  Space Monkeys are leaving, hesitantly.

Jack and Marla are left alone.

Jack tries to got up.  Marla helps him.

MASSIVE EXPLOSION... the glass walls rattle...

Jack and Marla look -- OUT THE WINDOWS: a BUILDING EXPLODES;

collapsing upon itself.  Then, ANOTHER BUILDING IMPLODES

into a massive cloud of dust.  Jack and Marla are

silhouetted against the SKYLINE.  Jack looks to Marla,

reaches to take her hand.

Marla looks at him.  ANOTHER BUILDING IMPLODES and COLLAPSES

inward... and ANOTHER BUILDING... and ANOTHER...

The FILM SLOWS, then ADVANCES ONE FRAME at a TIME -- SHOWING

SPROCKET HOLES on the SIDES.  EACH FRAME is an IMPLODING

BUILDING -- then, ONE FRAME IS A PENIS.  Then, the IMPLODING

BUILDING again.  SPEED UP the frames, LOSE the sprocket

holes, RESUME NORMAL SPEED...
