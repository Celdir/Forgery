FADE IN

INT. SUMMER COTTAGE -- DAY

A young family together in bed.  It is a bright summer

morning.  Father, mother, and a three year old girl are

still asleep.  They are naked.  A light breeze drifts into

the room.  The scene is serene and softly suspended.

Head credits appear over this idyllic image.  The little

girl turns in her sleep.  A dog barks outside.

INT./EXT.  CAR WASH. -- NIGHT

From the peaceful tableau of the sleeping family, the scene

shifts to a vehicle entering a car wash.  The image is shot

through the windshield, from the driver's point of view.

The car enters the lathered world of spinning felt wheels

and gushing water.

INT. CAR WASH. -- NIGHT

Inside the car MITCHELL STEPHENS, a man in his mid-fifties,

listens to a stirring piece of music.  The sound of the car

wash is filtered out by the strains of music.

EXT. PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT

The phone booth is located in a rundown area of a large

city.  A young woman, ZOE, enters the booth and lifts the

receiver.

INT. CAR WASH. -- NIGHT

MITCHELL STEPHENS is going through the wash.  The automatic

mops and buffers embrace his car with water and suds.  The

cellular phone in the car rings.  MITCHELL picks it up.

INT. PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT

ZOE is on the phone.  There's a figure outside the booth

waiting for her.

INT. CAR WASH. -- NIGHT

MITCHELL in his car, playing with the volume on his radio.

Pause.  MITCHELL doesn't respond.

INT. PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT

INT. CAR WASH. -- NIGHT

MITCHELL is emotionally stunned by ZOE'S voice.  She is

heard over the phone.

The music that MITCHELL has been listening to becomes louder

as he stares at the spinning felt wheels of the car wash.

MITCHELL is in pain.  He closes his eyes.

INT. PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT

The phone booth is deserted.  ZOE is nowhere to be seen.

Over this image, the sounds of a band playing a blues

number.

EXT. FAIRGROUND -- DAY

The blues number continues as the camera cranes down to the

bandstand of a country fair.  A local band is rehearsing.

Around the practising band, various carpenters and

technicians are making final preparations for that evening's

big event.

One of the people watching the band is SAM BURNELL, a man in

his early forties.  He watches his daughter, NICOLE, as she

sings into the microphone.  NICOLE is sixteen.

NICOLE stares at her father as she sings.

ANGLE ON

SAM looking back at his daughter.  He is intensely proud of

her.  SAM is a carpenter, working on at the fair site.  He

gets back to his work, hammering a supporting beam into the

grandstand.

INT. AIRPORT. WASHROOM -- AFTERNOON

CLOSE UP of a three year old girl, staring up into the lens.

Her face is full of sweetness and trust.

ANGLE ON

MITCHELL STEPHENS in a crowded airport washroom, watching a

young father, PETER, trying to change the diaper on his

three year old daughter.

MITCHELL stares at the little girl, his face registering a

wistful smile.  PETER is having a hard time trying to find

the towel from the toddler's bag and keeping an eye on her

at the same time.

MITCHELL comes forward and searches through the toddler's

bag.

PETER lays the towel across the counter, and dries the

little girl.  MITCHELL watches as PETER puts a new diaper on

her.  The toddler stares up at MITCHELL, her eyes are

playful.

MITCHELL stares at the girl's face.

INT. CAR WASH. -- NIGHT

TIME CUT back to MITCHELL honking the horn of his car,

trying to get someone's attention.  No response.  MITCHELL

picks up his cell phone, and dials the operator.

The line has died.

MITCHELL searches for an umbrella, finds one, and tries to

get out of the car without getting soaked.

ANGLE ON

MITCHELL as he leaves the car, trying to protect himself

from the onslaught of water with his umbrella.  He is

immediately soaked by a large mop.  The camera watches

MITCHELL as he makes his way towards light at the end of the

wash.

INT. CAR WASH. -- NIGHT

MITCHELL walks into the office of the car wash.  No one is

there.  There is an ominous buzz coming from another room.

MITCHELL moves towards the garage of the car wash/auto

repair establishment.  He moves into a larger room, full of

discarded auto parts.  The buzzing noise is coming from an

electric guitar, which has been left on, and is on the verge

of screeching feedback.

Someone was just here.  They are nowhere to be seen.

No response.  MITCHELL picks up the guitar, which begins to

produce a terrifying electronic feedback.

EXT. FAIRGROUND -- DAY

SAM and NICOLE wander through the fairground.  Various rides

and concession stands are being set up.  SAM has his arm

around NICOLE.

arms around him in a gesture of unabashed excitement.

EXT. BIDE-A-WILE MOTEL -- DUSK

MITCHELL STEPHEN'S car pulls into the parking lot of this

run-down roadside motel.  In the fading light, a magnificent

mountain range is seen in the background.

INT. BIDE-A-WILE MOTEL -- EVENING

MITCHELL enters the reception area, and rings a bell on the

desk.  After a few moments RISA WALKER appears.  She is an

exhausted looking woman in her mid-thirties, once attractive

but very run-down.  RISA stares at MITCHELL'S soaked

clothes.

Pause.  RISA stares at MITCHELL, her expression somewhere

else.

A voice is heard from the darkness beyond the desk.

WENDELL WALKER, RISA'S husband, appears from the darkness.

MITCHELL stares at WENDELL'S haunted eyes, then looks back

at RISA.  He immediately knows their story.

EXT. FAIRGROUND -- DAY

A group of men are setting up the ferris wheel for the

country fair.  SAM and NICOLE walk into the shot, eating ice

cream cones.  SAM waves at someone he recognizes in the

distance.

NICOLE nods, her mind elsewhere.

EXT. FAIRGROUND -- DAY

SAM and NICOLE are sitting at an outside table, finishing

their cones.

A school bus pulls up into the fairground.  NICOLE watches

as young children spill out of the bus and gather outside.

see the children, then turns back to NICOLE.

leading the young children into the large exhibition barn on

the fair site.

WALKER in their livingroom behind the reception area.

RISA nods.  MITCHELL crosses the LAMBSTONS off of his list.

He looks up at RISA and WENDELL.

The WALKERS nod.

RISA stares hard at MITCHELL.

Pause.

Beat.  MITCHELL looks at WENDELL, waiting for an

explanation.

MITCHELL regards WENDELL with a slight smile of admiration.

MITCHELL is taking notes.

Pause.  MITCHELL waits.  No response from WENDELL.

As RISA talks, MITCHELL takes notes.

continues to make notes.

INT. AIRPLANE. FIRST CLASS CABIN -- DAY

A newscaster is giving a report on the television screen of

a first class airplane cabin.  The image is silent.

This scene takes place two years after the accident.

MITCHELL STEPHENS is playing with his headset, which doesn't

seem to be working.  He summons a STEWARDESS over.

The STEWARDESS checks the headset and confirms the problem.

The STEWARDESS leaves.

A young woman seated beside MITCHELL hands him her headset.

MITCHELL takes ALISON'S headset.  Their eyes lock for a

moment.

Pause.  MITCHELL finally remembers ALISON JONES.

Pause.  The STEWARDESS comes back with a new headset.  She

notices the set that ALISON has given him.

The STEWARDESS hands the headset to ALISON.

The camera has remained fixed on MITCHELL'S face.

their adopted son BEAR.

goodbye to their boy.  WANDA gives BEAR a photograph, which

has strong psychedelic influences.  BEAR shows it proudly to

DOLORES.

INT. DOLORES'S HOUSE -- DAY

DOLORES and MITCHELL are in the modest livingroom of

DOLORES'S house.  The conversation continues from the

previous voice over.

In the corner of the room sits ABBOTT, DOLORES'S husband.

ABBOTT has suffered a massive stroke, and seems to be

completely paralyzed.  His presence, however, is intense and

powerful.

MITCHELL frequently looks over to ABBOTT during his

conversations with DOLORES.  ABBOTT is always watching him

like a hawk, making MITCHELL uneasy.

MITCHELL turns around to find the picture of BEAR.

It is right behind ABBOTT'S head, so MITCHELL has to divide

his attention between the cute PHOTOGRAPH of BEAR clutching

a prize rabbit at last year's county fair, and ABBOTT'S

glaring eyes.

ANGLE ON

The PHOTOGRAPHS of various children with their pets.  Some

have ribbons.

ANGLE ON

The STEWARDESS leaves with MITCHELL'S food.  MITCHELL gets

up.

ALISON nods.  MITCHELL leaves.  ALISON picks at her meat

undecidedly.

INT. AIRPLANE. FIRST CLASS CABIN -- DAY

In the mirror of the tiny washroom of the plane, MITCHELL

washes some water on his face.  He stares at his reflection

in the mirror.

gets out of his car and knocks on the door.

WANDA OTTO answers.  She has been crying.  The two stare at

each other.

Pause.

WANDA pauses, stares at MITCHELL, then lets him in.

INT. THE OTTOS HOUSE. -- DAY

MITCHELL walks into the OTTO residence.  It is a large two-

storey space divided into several smaller chambers with

sheets of brightly colored cloth - tie-dyes and Indian

madras - that hang from wires.

On a low brick platform in the centre of the main chamber is

a large wood-burning stove.  A few feet from the stove,

sitting on an overstuffed cushion, is HARTLEY OTTO.

HARTLEY is listening to music on his headphones.  He is very

stoned.  WANDA moves over, and pulls the headphones off her

husband's head.

MITCHELL hands them a card.  HARTLEY reads it with

deliberation.

HARTLEY rises up.  He stares at MITCHELL.  A tense pause.

WANDA stares at MITCHELL.  No response.  MITCHELL waits a

beat, then seats himself rather uncomfortably on a large

pillow.  He is unsure whether to cross his legs, or fold

them under his chin.

Pause.  MITCHELL assesses WANDA'S energy.

HARTLEY returns with the tea.

MITCHELL takes the cup of tea.

Pause.

Pause.

MITCHELL nods sympathetically.

Pause.  HARTLEY looks at MITCHELL'S teacup.

The room is dark.  After a while, RISA enters through the

door and slips inside.

BILLY gets up to put out his cigarette in the toilet.  He

notices some work tools in the washroom.

BILLY nods.  He turns around, looks at RISA, and begins to

unbutton her shirt.  RISA stops him, smiles, and kisses

BILLY.  After a moment, she pulls away, unbuckles her belt,

and slips off her jeans.  She moves to the bed.

BILLY moves to the radio and turns it on, tuning into a

hockey game.  RISA laughs.  He lowers the volume.  RISA

takes off her shirt, and moves behind BILLY, kissing his

neck.  BILLY closes his eyes.

INT. BILLY'S HOUSE. -- EVENING

JESSICA and MASON, BILLY'S children, are being read to sleep

by NICOLE.  She reads from Robert Browning's THE PIED PIPER

LYDIA.

Back to NICOLE, selecting various items of LYDIA'S clothing,

and placing them over her body, seeing how she looks in the

mirror.

EXT. BIDE-A-WILE MOTEL -- DAY

RISA'S DAYDREAM.  A montage of various events, watched from

the window in Room 11.  RISA is seen talking to BILLY on her

cordless phone (Scene 34), as well as going through various

activities.  Finally, RISA is seen putting her son, SEAN,

into the schoolbus.  As the bus pulls away, RISA waves

stops in front of the lens and stares into it, her

expression calm and serene.

Present time.  Night.  RISA is sitting on the bed, naked,

her legs crossed.  She looks to the side, lost in thought.

moves to the door.

RISA nods.

BILLY leaves.  RISA, still naked, moves to the washroom.

it.

looks at his mother.  He extends his hands like a baby

wanting to be hugged.

Pause.  RISA stares at her son with great intensity and

feeling.

SEAN turns away and looks into the bus full of children.

MASON is sitting beside NICOLE.  NICOLE whispers something

to him, and he makes his way for SEAN.

changes as he sees...

EXT. ROAD. -- MORNING

From BILLY'S point of view, the schoolbus smashes through

the guardrail and the snowbank.  It plummets down the

embankment to the frozen-over pond.

Still upright, the bus slides across the ice to the far

side.  The ice lets go and the rear half of the yellow bus

is swallowed at once by the freezing water.  The sound of

the ice breaking is terrifying.

An eerie silence as the camera stares at the scene of the

accident.

INT. SUMMER COTTAGE -- MORNING

The camera is high above the bed, looking down on a sleeping

family.

This is the same image as from the beginning of the film.

camera.

INT. BIDE-A-WILE MOTEL -- EVENING

Pause.

BILLY gets up to leave.

RISA is crying.  BILLY opens the door.

BILLY stares at RISA painfully, then leaves.

EXT. GAS STATION -- NIGHT

MITCHELL is videotaping the bus with a portable camcorder.

The bus is badly damaged, though essentially intact.  Most

of the windows in the rear have gone.  There is a ghostly

quality to this image, as though the video light is

searching through the remains of an ancient shipwreck.

MITCHELL turns off the camcorder and stands in the silent

night, absorbing the disturbing energy of the bus.  He hears

a truck approaching the garage from the distance.  It's

BILLY ANSEL.  MITCHELL retreats to his parked car as BILLY

stops his truck in front of the bus and steps out of the

truck.

BILLY leaves his headlights on, and they cast dark shadows

over the inside passenger seats.  BILLY stares at the bus a

long time.  MITCHELL approaches him.

BILLY takes a moment, then turns around to face MITCHELL.

The two men stare at each other.

MITCHELL hands BILLY a card.

BILLY looks at the card.

BILLY stares at MITCHELL with a cold intensity.  The cell

phone in MITCHELL'S car begins to ring.

The phone continues to ring, as BILLY stares at MITCHELL.

grasping onto ABBOTT'S hand.

MITCHELL nods.

Pause.  MITCHELL plans his next step.

Pause.  DOLORES is lost.

MITCHELL stares at DOLORES.

Suddenly, ABBOTT says something.  He twists his face around

string of broken syllables and sounds.  After this outburst,

DOLORES looks at MITCHELL, a comforted smile on her face.

MITCHELL stares at ABBOTT, who stares back.

EXT. DOLORES'S HOUSE -- DAY

modest house.

SAM opens the door and puts the wheelchair up next to it.

He points out the ramp he has built for NICOLE.

The ramp is painted green.

INT. BURNELL HOME -- DAY

Inside the house.  The interior of the house is dark and

somewhat tawdry.  The BURNELL'S are almost poor.

But SAM then leads NICOLE into the special room he has built

for her.  It seems like another world.  Every detail has

been lovingly attended to.  No expense has been spared to

make this room as attractive and inviting as possible.

A room that a guilty, abusive father might dream up for his

crippled daughter.

Pause.  NICOLE wheels around, trying to control her emotions

as she inspects the room.  A phone rings in the background.

MARY goes to answer it.

NICOLE fixes her gaze at the back of the door.

SAM goes to get his tools.  JENNY stares at NICOLE.

NICOLE grabs her sister's hand, and JENNY moves in close to

her.  SAM comes back with the tools.  He starts to screw in

the hook.

SAM leaves again.

NICOLE stares at JENNY, as MARY comes back into the room.

SAM comes back and begins to work on the door.  NICOLE

watches him.  She notices a new computer on a desk.

MARY turns to JENNY.

JENNY looks at NICOLE.

JENNY turns to leave.  When she's outside, MARY continues.

There's a tension, as it seems as though JENNY is going to

let herself fall.
