THE BIG BLUE

FADE IN:

EXT.  GREEK ISLAND - SUNSET

CREDIT SEQUENCE:

The image is in black and white.

The sun disappears behind arid cliffs which cast giant

shadows on the sea.

A little boy around 8 years old -- tanned from head to toe

-- sprints along the cliffs, scrambles from one rock to

another with amazing agility.

In one hand, he carries a transparent plastic bag.  In the

other, a net bag containing flippers, mask, pants and

sweater.

The only thing that slows him down is his bathing suit --

obvious hand-me-downs -- way too big.  He tugs on them as

he goes, holding them up... Until they slide again... as

he leaps again... and pulls them up...

The little boy is JACQUES MAYOL.

End credits.

EXT.  GREEK ISLAND - SUNSET

JACQUES reaches a ledge jutting out over a deserted cove.

He spits in his mask... expertly spreads the spit with a

finger... locks his feet into the flippers... and dives.

He surfaces a long way out... adjusts his mask... and

swims away from shore.

IN OPEN SEA

The boy stops swimming -- starts to gulp air -- sucks it

in -- oxygenating his blood in a series of deep rapid

breaths -- almost hyperventilating, almost alarming if

we've never seen this before.

His gaze is glued to the ocean floor.  Clear clear water.

40 feet deep.  And intensely blue.

Suddenly, he catches his breath and dives -- into the

blue.

UNDERWATER

JACQUES touches bottom.  Clamps his legs around a rock to

hold himself down.  Unhurried, thoroughly at home, 40 feet

under... he opens the plastic bag.  A huge speckled moray

eel appears in a hole in the rock, slithers toward him.

The carnivore's jaws are bigger than the boy's head.

The boy smiles at him.  Pulls a piece of raw meat out of

his bag and holds it out.  The eel takes the morsel

delicately -- and slithers back into his hole.

Gravely, JACQUES takes another morsel out of the bag.

EXT.  VILLAGE - DUSK

JACQUES walks up a steep road bordering the port, almost

dry now.

Two boys about his age run up the streets; call out, catch

up with him and gesture toward the port.

EXT.  PIER - DUSK

The little boys tug JACQUES to the end of the pier and

point to something in the water.

JACQUES walks over, and sure enough sees something shining

a few feet down in the water.

Camera pans and we see a middle-aged PRIEST loading

supplies into a small boat.  He stops to watch the

children's negotiations.  Little JACQUES is putting his

flippers on.

The two boys nod as they point to the coin.

The pope smiles.

The two boys look at each other.

The voice is ENZO'S.  Another young boy wearing little

round glasses.

He is slightly older than JACQUES but he is taller.  ENZO

is with ROBERTO, his younger brother, the only one allowed

to carry his flippers.  Five kids are behind him.

ENZO pats JACQUES on the shoulder and leaves his hand

there -- a lightly intimidating gesture.

ENZO pats his shoulder reassuringly.

ROBERTO who has already started to moisten his big

brother's gear in the water, holds a pair of dripping

flippers and a glistening mask.  The pope watches the

scene with obvious pleasure.

Sure of himself, ENZO takes a deep breath and dives in the

water.  ROBERTO counts out loud.

The kids all walk over to the edge of the pier.  A few

feet away, JACQUES takes off his flippers.

ENZO bursts out of the water, the coin in his hand.  The

children cheer and clap.  ROBERTO rushes to catch the

equipment that comes flying at him, piece by piece.

ENZO walks over to JACQUES.

JACQUES doesn't answer.

ENZO smiles and slowly puts the coin in his pocket.  He

pulls it out again and waves it under JACQUES' nose.

ENZO looks at JACQUES for a while.

JACQUES doesn't say anything, then finally shakes his

head, negatively.  ENZO smiles, taps him on the shoulder.

The first boy finally sums up his courage to speak.

ENZO laughing, sticks the coin in his pocket and leaves

the pier with his gang.

The pope smiles and pulls a coin from his pocket.

With his flippers dangling from one hand, JACQUES sadly

stares out at the sea.  The pope calls him over.

JACQUES goes over to him, sees where he is pointing, the

faint gleam of the coin underwater.

JACQUES, intent on the coin's glimmer, quickly slips on

his fins, prepares his mask.  He swims in the water like a

fish, goes directly to the coin.  Scoops it up, brings it

to the surface.

He breaks water, waves the coin, looks for the priest and

sees he is no longer there.

He looks at the ancient impression on the coin -- "Boy on

a Dolphin".

ON JACQUES - UNDERWATER

He's swimming near the spot where he fed the moray eel.

He senses something behind him and turns around.  He sees

a dolphin, still and silent, floating vertically.  It

seems to be watching him.  The surprise is such that

JACQUES is in a panic, leaps up to the surface...

ON JACQUES - IN BED

He bolts upright, as if suddenly awakening from a dream.

INT.  ROOM - ON JACQUES' FATHER - DARK

A BURLY MAN, around fifty, crosses the room in the shadows

and throws open the shutters with a bang.  Sunlight pours

in.  He walks over to JACQUES' bed in the one room house,

and runs his hand through his hair.

JACQUES rubs his eyes.  His father walks over to a pile of

blankets on the floor, on the other side of the room.  He

gives the pile a kick.

He uncovers a kettle on the fire and ladles up a big bowl

of soup for Jacques.  A fifty year old man pokes his head

out from under the pile of blankets.  It's UNCLE LOUIS,

who is having a very hard time, waking up.

EXT.  HOUSE - DAY

JACQUES bursts out of the house, running.  Diving gear

under his arm.  A piece of buttered bread in his mouth.

He catches up with his father and UNCLE LOUIS.  They're on

a path winding down to the port.  JACQUES slows down

abruptly.  Tries to imitate their stride.  The weather is

balmy and the sea lies before them, peaceful and blue.

EXT.  SEA - DAY

Their boat on the water.  The chug of its ENGINE ECHOES

off the cliffs.  A few gulls -- drawn by the sound -- skim

the waves of its wake.

EXT.  BOAT - DAY

On board.  JACQUES' Father checks the antique air pump.

JACQUES polishes the enormous copper diver's helmet and

lays out the rest of an old fashioned deep sea diver's

suit.

At the foot of an old monastery another boat passes.

The Priest is in it.

JACQUES' Father and LOUIS take off their caps.  JACQUES

takes the gold coin out of his pocket.

The pope nods to JACQUES.  His father looks over at him

without understanding.  The child quickly puts the coin

back in his pocket.

EXT.  BOAT - DAY

LOUIS casts anchor.  A few feet away, siting on a rock,

the kid with little round glasses is fishing.  He turns

around to the boat.  JACQUES smiles and waves at him.

ENZO waves back, obviously disturbed in his fishing

session.

JACQUES helps his father into the diver's suit.  The burly

man struggles into a pair of weighted lead shoes.  He

seems sluggish and tired.  JACQUES watches worriedly.  He

has a weird feeling.

His father catches him fondly by the scruff of the neck.

Father and son smile at each other.  Then his father puts

the helmet on.  JACQUES joins LOUIS at the pump.

The heavy diver's suit disappears slowly underwater.  The

gleaming copper helmet is the last thing to slide out of

sight.

JACQUES and LOUIS work the pump.  Regular, steady motions

to maintain the flow of air.

They keep on pumping for a while, then...

UNCLE LOUIS goes on.  JACQUES doesn't budge.

JACQUES looks at the bottom to watch his father.

He doesn't answer.

UNDERWATER - JACQUES' FATHER

He moves along slowly in his cumbersome diving suit.  He

is working the top of a rock outcrop on the sea floor.  He

sees a sponge, hooks it; puts it in a bag that's attached

to a life line from the boat fastened to his waist.  He

moves on.

INT.  BOAT - JACQUES AND LOUIS PUMPING

They keep up the rhythm.  Sitting on a rock at a distance,

ENZO watches them.  UNCLE LOUIS is bored stiff.

JACQUES calmly looks over at him, slows down his pumping

and almost serenely asks him:

UNCLE LOUIS seems disturbed by the question.  A beat.

UNDERWATER - JACQUES' FATHER

He is walking with difficulty at the bottom.  His bag is

full of sponges.  He seems to be having trouble breathing.

EXT.  BOAT - JACQUES AND LOUIS

JACQUES and LOUIS are pumping silently.  UNCLE LOUIS feels

obliged to answer JACQUES' question.

UNCLE LOUIS finally breaks the silence and explains:

They haven't been paying attention to the bubbles gushing

at the surface.  The air hose is being pulled down in a

very worrisome way.

UNCLE LOUIS smiles.

Very pleased with himself, UNCLE LOUIS burst out laughing.

JACQUES shyly shrugs his shoulders.  The air hose is

suddenly yanked down.  JACQUES immediately sees all the

bubbles.  He is white as a sheet.

JACQUES rushes to the side of the boat and starts yelling

down at his father.  He grabs the life line and starts

pulling at it hysterically.  The air hose snaps and

starts flying around like some crazy snake.  JACQUES tries

to jump overboard.  UNCLE LOUIS catches hold of his foot

at the last second.  JACQUES is slapping the water with

his hands, trying to go down but UNCLE LOUIS won't let

him.  JACQUES is yelling desperately.  ENZO is now

standing on his rock, watching the scene, horrified.

The sea now looks as if it were boiling.

UNCLE LOUIS grabs hold of JACQUES and hugs him in his

arms.  Standing on his rock, ENZO is now crying

desperately.

The last air bubbles are now breaking on the surface; it

looks as if they will never stop.

EXT.  ITALIAN VILLAGE STREET - DAY

The image is now in color.

A rocky pink cliff over looks the very bright sea which

fills the screen.

SUPERIMPOSED:  1987 SICILY

ALFREDO runs (skips) up the cobbled street as fast as he

can go, surprisingly fast.

He runs to the large terrace of a restaurant which he

enters.  We have time to read the sign carrying the

restaurant's name:  "LA MAMMA".

INT.  RESTAURANT - DAY

ALFREDO skips in.  He is panting, covered in sweat.  His

panic is palpable.  The whole room watches him approach a

long table where a large family is having a birthday party

for a very old lady.

He has to stop a second and catch his breath before he can

get the words out.  Then leans over and whispers in the

ear of a great big man -- around 30 -- built like a bull,

wearing little round glasses.

The man listens, then stiffens.

EXT.  HARBOR - CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

A beat-up FIAT, towing an equally beat-up trailer, stops.

ENZO unfolds out of the driver's seat, like a circus clown

emerging from a toy car.

The construction SUPERVISOR, an American, wearing a three

piece suit, hurries over to him.

ENZO has already started undressing.  ROBERTO unloads the

diving gear from the trailer.

ENZO goes back to the car.

ENZO glances at the map, then at the accident site.

ENZO opens the trunk of his FIAT and pulls out the jack.

He slams the trunk shut, and stands looking at the

American, straight in the eyes.

Extremely uncomfortable, the SUPERVISOR doesn't answer.

EXT.  UNFINISHED PIER - ENZO

He's at the end of the pier, his feet dangling in the

muddy water of the port.  A few feet away a pump sends air

HISSING through a rubber tube to the diver trapped below.

ENZO inhales steadily, his chest heaving like a bellow.

He carefully puts his spectacles inside his shoes, dons

his flippers, etc., with his usual flair of suspense.

Behind him the SUPERVISOR and other construction workers

watch expectantly.  ROBERTO heaves a stone weight into the

bay, a cable attached to it plays out from a drum on the

pier.

ENZO ignoring everyone, grabs the ordinary tire jack,

flip-flops over to the now taut cable, the stone has hit

bottom.  He takes a deep breath and dives into the bay.

UNDERWATER - WRECK

ENZO dives down a chimney of muck.  Picks his way over and

around every hazard, until he reaches the diver, trapped

under a huge piece of debris.

He pats his shoulder to comfort him, he then inserts the

tire jack under a piece of concrete... And, as if he were

changing a tire, begins to pump the handle...

Slowly, in a swirl of mud and water, the chunk of debris

rises off the diver's leg.

EXT.  CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

Everyone is staring at the water silently, suspensefully.

The SUPERVISOR has his checkbook in hand, but has

completely forgotten it, intent upon what's going on

underwater.  ROBERTO taps him on the shoulder.

UNDERWATER - WRECK

ENZO cuts the cables tangled around the diver's torso.

Then he takes off his flippers, plants his bare feet on

the concrete, grabs the diver by the shoulders and pulls

him free.

The diver drops the air tube and climbs as quickly as

possible toward the surface.

EXT.  CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

The diver surfaces, gasping for breath.  A cheer goes up

from the crowd.  Several men hurry to pull him onto dry

land.  But there is no sign of ENZO.  Everyone waits,

breathless.

Suddenly, ENZO appears, burst out of the water, holding

his flippers up in the air like a trophy.  The onlookers

cheer, help him out of the water, slapping him on the

back.

ENZO tosses the jack and his flippers to ROBERTO.

Impassive and silent, he slips his arms into the prize

fighter's robe that ROBERTO holds out for him, walks

solemnly back to his car.

ROBERTO takes the check and walks over to the car.  ENZO

bends down into the car and opens the roof.

The car rushes off.  In the distance we see a police

(carabinieri) car and an old fire engine rolling in the

direction of the construction site.

INSIDE FIAT - DRIVING AWAY

ENZO'S car drives past them.  ENZO looks at ROBERTO out of

the corner of his eye, then suddenly explodes with joy.

ROBERTO whoops and whistles.  ENZO reaches over and leans

on the horn.  The little car races by and finally stops at

the top of the cliff facing the sea.

EXT.  TOP OF CLIFF - DAY

The two brothers sit back, relax.

Stare out to sea.

EXT.  FLAKES OF SNOW - MOUNTAINS - DAY

Mountain peaks, stark and white.  A winter sky which is

strangely and disquietingly dark.  A landscape swept by

snow.

SUPERIMPOSED ON SCREEN: PERU - LAKE HUACRACOCHA - MAY 1987

A yellow light comes out of the storm -- advances toward

us.  The headlight of a train.

A narrow gauge locomotive steams up grade pushing piles of

snow in front of it.

INT.  TRAIN - DAY

Sitting in the train, leaning against the misty window,

JOHANA CROSS, 27, has clear quick charm and a sort of

romantic fragility.  She is dressed simply but warmly.

She looks through the window; all she sees is white.

It is clear that she was not the one who decided on this

trip.  Reading the key phrases from a beat-up note book,

she calls upon an old Peruvian.

The old man goes into a long, rambling explanation.

JOHANA nods without understanding a thing.

EXT.  TRAIN STATION - DAY

The train pulls in, slowly pushing piles of snow in front

of it and finally stops in front of an old shack which

serves as the station.

A man, FRANK, bundled in a parka, comes out of a

snowmobile parked by the station, and walks up to the

train.

JOHANA steps down, carrying her suitcase and drops two

feet in the snow as she comes off the last step.  FRANK

walks over and leans down towards her.

INT.  SNOWMOBILE - DAY

FRANK throws the luggage into the back of the snowmobile,

jumps in and turns the ignition on.  JOHANA takes her hat,

scarf and gloves off.  FRANK glances over at her, he is

both amused and charmed.

FRANK smiles and kicks the heating system, then leans over

to check it, his eyes off the road.

EXT.  LAKE OF THE DEMON - CAMP - DAY

The storm is at its peak.  The frozen snowmobile plows

along side the lake HUACRACOCHA and stops in front of a

cluster of quonset huts almost completely buried in snow.

FRANK gets the bags out of the back.  The suitcases are by

now frozen stiff.  JOHANA follows in his steps.

A couple of llamas are huddled up against the hut in

attempt to protect themselves from the storm.

JOHANA is bewildered.  Shacks in the middle of the Andes,

the lake of the "Demon", and now llama that have to be

pushed aside to enter one's home.

As FRANK opens the door, a man is leaving the hut.  The

man is JACQUES MAYOL.  JOHANA and JACQUES pass each other

in slow motion.  Everything seems suddenly suspended:

time, sound, cold...

JACQUES MAYOL instantly makes an impression on her.  He is

now 34, still dark-haired, with dark eyes.  He is wearing

a red diving suit and a pair of round goggles.  He looks

like some legendary creature one would dream about.

Everything finally regains its formal speed.  The door

slams, the man is gone.  She and FRANK are in the middle

of the entrance hall.  JOHANA hasn't yet gotten over the

vision she has just had, but she regains composure and

enters the next room.

INT.  QUONSET HUT

JOHANA happily takes her gloves off.

FRANK puts down the bags and walks into the next room.

It's a sort of laboratory, filled with ultra modern

equipment.

A big bay window overlooks the lake on which is built a

long wooden dock.

Sitting in a corner, an old Peruvian man is preparing hot

drinks.  JOHANA drops into a chair.

FRANK smiles and pours some whiskey in her tea cup.

FRANK smiles and pours JOHANA some tea.  She warms her

hands on the cup.  She asks blankly.

LAWRENCE comes in from the other side of the room.

He walks straight over to the bay window.

JOHANA walks over to the bay window and starts staring at

something in the distance.

EXT.  DOCK - ON JACQUES

At the end of the dock, JACQUES who is sitting on the edge

of a hole which is cut in the ice, is putting a pair of

gloves on.  He then grabs the handles of a strange machine

which emerges from the water and starts taking deep

breaths, oblivious to the cold, his mind completely

elsewhere.

BACK IN LAB

JOHANA watches JACQUES.  She just can't believe her eyes.

LAWRENCE is bent over one of his machines, fiddling with

different switches.

JOHANA is finally able to speak.

LAWRENCE turns one last knob.

JOHANA walks closer to the window.  She isn't hearing a

thing he's saying.

JACQUES is putting on his flippers.

JOHANA can't believe it.

JACQUES is standing by a hole cut in the ice.  He is

holding onto the machine in the water.  He is waving a

mask.

JACQUES takes a deep breath, turns a handle and a weight

yanks him straight down into the water.  LAWRENCE sets his

stop watch off and flips a few switches.

JOHANA grabs his arm as if they could do something about

it.

He raises the volume:  we hear the man's heartbeat through

a small speaker.

LAWRENCE tears off the sheet with the heartbeat measures

on it and hands it to JOHANA.

JOHANA feels she's on the verge of crying, and can't

figure it out.

UNDERWATER - JACQUES

JACQUES stops his machine by turning one of the handles.

He's deep beneath the surface of the frozen lake.  He

swims deliberately, carefully into a large tube which is

hinged open.  He closes it around himself.  His heart is

still slowing down.  He pushes a button on the machine,

and a flash of light bursts in the opaque night

surrounding him.

BACK IN LAB - ON VIDEO SCREEN

We see a moving X-ray image.

JOHANA sighs with relief as JACQUES appears at the surface

in one big breath.

She heads towards the Old Peruvian and pours a cup of

coffee...

EXT.  DOCK - JACQUES SURFACING

He's groggy, half hypnotized.  He looks up at the dock,

sees JOHANA with a cup of coffee.  He stares at her.  She

hands him the coffee.

After a long beat...

JACQUES then turns around and walks toward the huts.

JOHANA still hasn't moved, as if petrified by her emotions

and the severe cold.  She then walks up to the hole in the

ice and peers into the dark water.  She shudders.

INT.  CABIN - DAWN

JOHANA emerges from a down sleeping bag.  She's wearing a

big sweater and a wool hat.  She is not sleeping.

Intrigued by the sound of the snowmobile, she gets up and

walks over to the frozen window.  JACQUES and FRANK are

loading their luggage onto the snowmobile.

Outside, LAWRENCE is saying "Goodbye" to JACQUES.  Unseen,

JOHANA also waves from behind her curtain.  JACQUES senses

something:  he turns around toward the cabin and smiles,

waving his hand at JOHANA.  She hides behind the curtain

and shyly waves back.

JACQUES gets into the snowmobile and drives out of the

frame.  We are left with an endless array of snow-caped

mountains.

EXT.  COTE D'AZUR - DAY

Fixed image of the Cote d'Azur.  The sparkling blue sea

fades into the distance.

A French taxi rides along the winding road overlooking the

creeks.

INT.  - TAXI

From behind all his bags, JACQUES obsessively stares at

the sea.

The driver smiles.

JACQUES smiles.

EXT.  ANTIBES - ROAD TO MARINELAND

The taxi comes to a stop in front of Marineland.  JACQUES

gets out, carrying one of his bags.

He enters Marineland.

EXT.  MARINELAND - ON JACQUES

The park is closed, the paths are deserted.  JACQUES

approaches the Dolphin's tank.  All three dolphins rise up

in the water.  Greet him with a click and clatter of

tongues.  JACQUES sits down at the edge of the tank.

He opens his duffel bag.  Hunts around, comes up with two

packages wrapped in brownpaper.  The dolphins stare at

him, intrigued.

The dolphins CACKLE some more.

He laughs.  The driver, who seems to be quite familiar

with the place, walks in heading straight over to the soda

machine.  Out of the corner of his eye, he takes in the

scene, very intrigued.

JACQUES has not noticed him.

He starts unwrapping the first package.

He produces a little ceramic Llama.

ON BATHSHEBA

looking at the llama, bewildered.  As bewildered as a

dolphin can be.  JACQUES turns the llama upside down.  It

moos:  HIAK, HIAK...

BATHSHEBA shakes her head.  JACQUES throws the llama into

the water.  He unwraps the second package.  A pair of

Peruvian gloves and hat.  Wide eyed, the driver sits in

the stands to watch the show.

He throws them to DARJEELING who catches them.

He pulls out a thermos.

He opens the thermos.

He sprinkles snow flakes on TINA'S head.  She tries to

taste it.

The three dolphins leap into the air and land with a huge

splash which soaks JACQUES.  He takes his shirt off.

He takes off his pants.  The taxi driver gets up, as if to

keep him from going in.  JACQUES dives into the pool.

UNDERWATER - ON JACQUES

He swims under the dolphin, reaches out and grabs hold of

the dolphin's snout.

The dolphin pulls JACQUES around and around the basin

while JACQUES pets his chest and belly.  We have never

seen JACQUES so relaxed and happy.

EXT.  MANHATTAN - DAWN

Overview of a gray and dirty Manhattan morning.  JOHANA

depressed, stares blankly out of the window of a yellow

cab.  She watches the muddy brown water flow under the

Brooklyn Bridge.

The driver keeps yelling obscenities to all the cars

around him.

EXT.  MANHATTAN - DAY

A suitcase in each hand, JOHANA gets out of the cab and

walks up the stairs of her apartment.

INT.  HALLWAY - DAY

JOHANA puts down her suitcase wearily.  Catches her breath

and gets out her keys.  She tries one in the top lock.  It

doesn't work.  She tries harder.  There's a woman's voice

yelling angrily from inside the apartment.

The door opens.

JOHANA comes in, looks at the ransacked apartment.

JOHANA goes over, slumps into an easy chair and sighs.

After a beat...

JOHANA opens her handbag, takes out the strip of

electrocardiogram paper, hands it to her.

INT.  APARTMENT - LATER

The living room is almost completely put back together...

SALLY is replacing books in the bookcase, JOHANA is using

a carpet sweeper, and talking away.

SALLY opens the drapes, revealing it's dawn outside.

UNDERWATER - SWIMMING POOL

JACQUES is swimming alone at the bottom of a gigantic

swimming pool.  He wears a monofin, his head and chest are

wired up to an assistant who runs back and forth alongside

the pool.

A man's feet are seen walking over to the side of the

pool.

JACQUES is swimming laps, arching his body like a dolphin.

As he approaches one end of the pool, he sees a coin

slowly falling in front of him.  JACQUES picks it up and

looks at it:  it's an old Greek coin.

JACQUES smiles and swims to the surface.

EXT.  ON SIDE OF SWIMMING POOL - DAY

JACQUES pokes his head out of the water and pulls off his

goggles.

ENZO stands over him, smiling.

A beat.

An uneasiness sweeps over ENZO'S face and quickly

disappears.

He laughs.  JACQUES smiles.  ENZO goes on.

ENZO puts down an airplane ticket on the side of the pool.

Surprised, JACQUES looks over at the ticket.

EXT.  OFFICE BUILDING - NEW YORK - DAY

INT.  DUFFY'S OFFICE - DUFFY - JOHANA

She is seated across the desk from him.  He's reading

through her report.  Behind him, outside the large plate

glass window, window-washers are seated on a scaffold

suspended far above the city.  They eat lunch.

JOHANA'S eyes wander (bored) around the office as DUFFY

reads.  He looks up.

She starts out of the office.

INT.  QUONSET HUT - PERU - DAY

Doctor LAWRENCE covers one ear with his hand as he yells

into the phone.

INT.  JOHANA'S OFFICE - MANHATTAN

JOHANA sits at her desk, she too is yelling into the

telephone.  Her colleague looks over at her and smiles.

INT.  QUONSET HUT - PERU - DAY

He is just about to hang up.

INT.  JOHANA'S OFFICE - MANHATTAN

JOHANA jumps up.

JOHANA starts snooping around the papers on her desk,

embarrassed by the presence of her colleague.

INT.  QUONSET HUT - PERU - DAY

INT.  DUFFY'S OFFICE - DAY

JOHANA dashes in without knocking.

EXT.  PORT OF MESSINE - DAY

A ferry comes into the dock, as a plank is slowly lowered.

As it descends, four rail cars lie in wait in its belly.

JOHANA comes off the boat, carrying her suitcase, she

wears a light summer dress.  She looks around, seeming a

little lost.

A white FIAT taxi screeches to a halt beside her.  JOHANA

jumps.  The driver whose arm loosely dangles from the car

window, grins at her.

EXT.  SAN DOMENICO - DAY

The white FIAT taxi pulls up in front of the SAN DOMENICO

hotel, but it is JACQUES who gets out of it.  The driver

helps him with his bags.

JACQUES looks down at the piece of paper stapled to his

ticket.

The Receptionist starts working on his papers again.

JACQUES, completely lost, stares blankly at the hotel

clerk, wondering what to do next.

INT.  HOTEL - DAY

The tiny FIAT clatters onto the sidewalk in front of the

hotel narrowly avoiding the Countess' limo.  Parks its

frontwheels on the sidewalk, rear end in the road.

ENZO, followed by ROBERTO, get out of his car, like a king

descending from his carriage.  On the way, he stops and

kisses a distinguished elderly woman's hand?  The hotel's

CONTESSA.

ENZO tosses his keys to a doorman who stepped up to

complain.

ENZO enters the hotel and sees JACQUES.

ENZO and JACQUES.  The two men kiss each other on both

cheeks, pound each others back.  They are both moved.

Roberto (26) nods to JACQUES who shakes his hand.

ENZO looks at him for a moment and gives him a warm smile.

He hands him his own keys.

PAOLO half-heartedly, hands him the key.  ENZO glances at

JACQUES to make sure he's properly impressed.  He throws

his arm around JACQUES' shoulder, hugs him and gives him a

real smile.

EXT.  HOTEL TERRACE TAORMINA - JACQUES - ENZO - DAY

They're at a table on a terrace that overlooks the sea.

They've just arrived and all around them people are

lunching away furiously.

ENZO beckons to a passing WAITER who comes to the table.

He's a very handsome, slightly effeminate young man.

The waiter hurries away.  ENZO watches his departure, then

thoughtfully.

JACQUES nods without really knowing.

ENZO starts laughing.  JACQUES would like to crawl under

the table.

EXT.  HOTEL TERRACE TAORMINA - JACQUES - ENZO - LATER

Their lunch is on the table, half eaten.

JACQUES is satisfied with his answer.  He thinks that the

subject is closed.  They eat silently for a moment.  ENZO

watches him.  Then:

ENZO bursts out laughing.

JACQUES doesn't seem to have ever thought about marriage.

JACQUES smiles.

EXT.  ENTRANCE TO TERRACE - ON JOHANA

JOHANA comes out of the stone tunnel which leads to the

terrace.  She looks over the crowd, trying to find

someone.

JACQUES is sitting with his back to her.  She finally

spots him and walks over to the table.

JACQUES turns around and recognizes her.  JOHANA smiles

and walks up to the table.  ENZO takes his watch off and

puts it on the table.

ENZO kisses her hand and brushes his watch off the table

in the same movement.

JOHANA sits down.

JOHANA has turned toward JACQUES, paying no attention to

ENZO.  JACQUES can't stop looking at JOHANA.

The waiter passes behind them.  ENZO reaches out, grabs

him by the arm, pulls him to the table.

ENZO pours the wine.

JOHANA shrugs fatalistically.  The waiter leaves.

JACQUES, intrigued, stares at JOHANA.  She pretends not to

notice.

He quickly brushes off the crumbs in front of him.

ON ENZO'S MOTHER

heading toward them.  She's a huge woman in widow's black.

She shoulders her way through the tables.

ROBERTO carrying her suitcases follows at her heels.

ENZO jumps to his feet.  Throws his arms around her.

A beat.  Signora MOLINARI inspects the plates on the

table.

Signora MOLINARI nods grudgingly.

Dead silence.

ENZO is the only one with no plate in front of him.

Signora MOLINARI'S eyebrows condense into a dark stripe

across her forehead.

JOHANA hands ENZO'S plate to the WAITER and takes the full

one.

And begins to eat, ignoring the expressions of amazement

all around her.

JOHANA nods enthusiastically, her mouth too full to speak.

MAMMA MOLINARI has a huge grin on her face.

EXT.  TAORMINA STREET - JACQUES, JOHANA - TWILIGHT

They emerge onto the street in front of the entrance of a

small rooming house.

JACQUES is carrying JOHANA'S luggage.  The old pension is

covered in bright pink bougainvilliers, there is laundry

hanging on the other side of the street.

They look at each other.  JACQUES is silent.  He just

stands there, a suitcase in each hand.

JOHANA breaks the silence.

He looks up at her as he pronounces the last word.  She

smiles at him, lovingly.

He lets go of the suitcases.  Suddenly, behind them, there

is a loud screech of tires.  The FIAT tears across the

street.

ENZO in his FIAT.  He pokes his head out of the window.

INT.  ENZO'S SUITE - ENZO, JACQUES, ROBERTO - NIGHT

They're in front of a wardrobe looking JACQUES over in the

full-length mirrors.  He's wearing an evening shirt and a

tuxedo of ENZO'S.  The collar is too big, the sleeves

hangover his hands.  He looks at himself dubiously in the

mirror.

ROBERTO hands ENZO the bow-tie, he hooks it around

JACQUES' collar.

JACQUES looks down at his tennis shoes.

EXT.  RECEPTION ON TERRACE - NIGHT

A big reception is organized on the terrace of the hotel.

The official divers and technicians are all gathered in

front of a podium.  The terrace is loaded with

photographers.

ROBERTO keeps turning round and round the long buffet

table.

JACQUES is alone at the bar.  Incongruous detail:  a

whiskey bottle on the table beside him.

JOHANA enters.  She has also had a few drinks.

He tugs at his over-sized tuxedo.

JACQUES looks down at his feet, doesn't know what to make

of her comment.  JOHANA sits down beside him and pours

herself a drink.  They touch glasses.

EXT.  ON PODIUM - NIGHT

On the podium, NOVELLI, the organizer of the championship,

stands in his tuxedo, talking into a microphone.  An older

man in a worn out suit, stands next to him.

The audience applauds.

NOVELLI can't quite read his notes.

ANDRE BONNET takes his turn to read the note.  A young

Tahitian jumps up, heads for the podium.

NOVELLI hesitates to repeat the name.

The audience cheers and applauds the new champion.  ENZO

sits at a table, watching the ceremony.

He gets up and walks out of the room.

INT.  BAR - NIGHT

JACQUES and JOHANA are sitting at the bar.  The whiskeys

have gone to their heads.  ENZO walks over to them.

JOHANA smiles and shakes her head.

JACQUES leaves the bar.  JOHANA watches him go.  ENZO

notices her way of watching him.  He's a little jealous.

She doesn't answer.

She smiles.

EXT.  TERRACE OF THE HOTEL - NIGHT

ENZO sits at the grand piano in the corner of the terrace.

Beethoven was always a favorite of his.

JACQUES, very tipsy by now walks over, a glass in each

hand.  He hands ENZO a glass, then takes off his tennis

shoes and sits them neatly on the piano.

JACQUES nods.

ENZO smiles, moved.

A beat.

ENZO grins at JACQUES and starts playing again.

JACQUES AND ENZO

There are now several empty champagne bottles around.

They are both quite drunk.  ENZO is philosophizing.

JOHANA is looking for them.

JACQUES can't answer.

JOHANA walks over to them.

ENZO hits a wrong note on the piano.

JOHANA stands next to JACQUES.

ENZO is getting really angry.  The drinks have a lot to do

with it.

ENZO pulls open his collar and rises.

EXT.  HOTEL - SWIMMING POOL - UNDERWATER - NIGHT

JACQUES and ENZO dive into the pool in their Tuxedos.

Each one carries a beach umbrella in a concrete base to

help them stay at the bottom.

ENZO takes two goblets out of his pocket, hands them to

JACQUES.  Takes a bottle of Champagne out of the other

pocket and opens it.  The cork floats out of the bottle.

Above on the surface of the pool there's a splash.  JOHANA

finds a mask on the side of the pool and watches them.

Her dress is soaked by now.

ENZO pours champagne.  Courteous and grave, they clink

glasses and begin to drink.  They have already been

underwater longer than a minute.  They can't really drink

out of the glasses and ENZO offers JACQUES the bottle.

JACQUES studies the label like a connoisseur.  He drinks,

passes the bottle back to ENZO.

INT.  HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Paramedics roll two stretchers toward the elevators at

full speed.  ENZO on one, JACQUES on the other.  Both men

keep throwing up water.

INT.  JACQUES'S ROOM - NIGHT

The paramedics roll the stretcher toward the bed.

JOHANA very worried, follows them.

The two men leave the room.

JOHANA walks over to the chair and rearranges JACQUES'

shirt and jacket which the paramedic had thrown down.

JACQUES looks like he's just had a very rough night.  He

sits up and grabs the sides of the bed, as if he were on a

moving boat.

JOHANA turns around, furious.

She walks over to the bed.

JOHANA wet, walks over to the wet clothes on the chair.

She pulls out JACQUES soaking wallet from one of the

jacket pockets.

She tries to wipe it.

JOHANA hands him the photograph.  He stares at it, looking

very sad.  Worried JOHANA sits down next to him.

She takes the picture out of his hands.

He is so upset that JOHANA can hardly help from crying

with him.  She sits next to him and strokes his hair.

JOHANA takes him in her arms.  He breaks down.

EXT.  HOTEL - DAWN

The early morning sun slowly lights up the water.  A yacht

has left the hotel dock.  It is moving out to sea off the

coast of TAORMINA.

EXT.  YACHT - ON DECK

This is the Committee Boat for the diving competition.

On the boat, ROBERTO is worried.  He checks his watch and

finally decides to wake up his brother.  ENZO is asleep in

the fore peak, curled up on a coil of line, snoring away.

He wears his tuxedo jacket over a skimpy bathing suit.

He gets up on one arm.

The boat stops.  The anchor is thrown over board.

The sailors, technicians and officials are getting ready

for the competition.  Today is ENZO'S turn to dive.  A man

is hooking a plaque indicating the depth (324 feet) onto a

lead disk which he heaves into the water on a cable.

INT.  YACHT - DOCTOR'S CABIN - DAY

A medic is bending over ENZO, taking his blood pressure.

ROBERTO pulls the tuxedo jacket down.  The doctor puts a

blood pressure band around ENZO'S upper arm, pumps it up.

He listens with his stethoscope.

ENZO jumps to his feet, grabs the doctor by his lapels,

lifts him in the air.

ENZO smiles and pats the doctor on the shoulder.

EXT.  YACHT - ON DIVING PLATFORM

It's a large float, rigged to the stern of the Committee

Boat.  ROBERTO and an assistant help ENZO down the swim

ladder to the platform.  He's wearing a wet suit and fins.

He flip-flops to the end of the platform.

ROBERTO hands him his mask.  The goggles are filled with

polystyrene to eliminate as much air pressure as possible.

Only two pinholes to see through.  The mask fits tightly

over his nose.  When ENZO puts it on, he looks like an

astonished insect.  ENZO breathes faster and faster.

ROBERTO holds the wire controlling the weighted diving

apparatus.  ENZO crosses himself, takes a last long gulp

of air.

ROBERTO releases the weight.  It sinks and drags ENZO

down, he quickly disappears into the dark water...

BLACK AND WHITE

But this is JACQUES as he was a child.  He swims along the

bottom, finds and picks up a gold coin.  We can see its

ancient markings, a youth on a dolphin.

JACQUES looks up.  In front of him is a dolphin, floating

vertically, still, apparently just watching.  JACQUES

isn't scared anymore.  But every time he swims toward the

dolphin, it moves further away.  It finally disappears.

INT.  HOTEL ROOM - JACQUES - DAY

He sits bolt upright in bed, awakened by his dream.  He

looks around the room, trying to get his bearings.

JOHANA is asleep in a chair across the room.  On the wall

behind her, her last nights dress is drying on a hanger.

She's wrapped up in a hotel bathrobe fast asleep.

JACQUES finally awake from his dream, sees JOHANA

sleeping.  He walks over to her, touches her shoulder.

She wakes up, starts out of the chair.  She grabs the

blanket to cover herself, and in doing so, a book falls on

the floor.  It's one of his.

JACQUES picks up the book.  JOHANA smiles.

She sits back in her chair, amazed that he would even ask.

EXT.  MARINELAND - TAORMINA - DAY

JACQUES and JOHANA enter the dolphinarium.  JOHANA is

wearing an old pair of JACQUES SHORTS along with an

oversized T-shirt and rolled up sweater.  She seems quite

pleased with her new attire.

JACQUES and JOHANA walk straight through MARINELAND and

head toward the dolphin pool.  It's pretty crowded, mostly

kids.

The dolphins are lying motionless at the bottom of the

pool.  The trainer is tired of throwing fish in the pool

and getting absolutely no reaction.

CLOSE ON DOLPHIN

surfacing.  It thrusts its head over the edge of the pool,

looks to JACQUES and SPEAKS.

Surprised, the trainer nods.

JOHANA looks over at JACQUES then at the dolphin.  She

doesn't understand.

Three other dolphins gather around the one that JACQUES is

patting.

JACQUES is staring at the female dolphin.  It looks like

the animal is trying to tell him something.  Suddenly the

dolphin grabs him by the sleeve and pulls him into the

pool.

UNDERWATER - DOLPHIN POOL

JACQUES hangs onto the dolphin's muzzle.  Let's it pull

him along.  The dolphin swims to a far corner of the pool,

and pulls JACQUES to the bottom.  The other dolphins

circle above.

EXT.  DOLPHIN POOL - DAY

JACQUES pops up.  As he does, three dolphins leap in the

air behind him.  JOHANA walks closer to the pool.  She is

so excited by what JACQUES is doing, she finally falls

into the pool.

After a while, JACQUES gets out of the pool and helps

JOHANA out.

JACQUES turns around and walks off.  JOHANA catches up

with him.

INT.  HALL - HOTEL - DAY

JACQUES and JOHANA are walking across the corridor.

ENZO walks up to them, followed by his tribe.  Everybody

is congratulating him.

ROBERTO is screaming, MAMMA MOLINARI is crying.  ENZO

smiles as he talks back to them.  He sees JACQUES.

ENZO grabs hold of his shoulders.  JACQUES and JOHANA are

completely soaked.

He gives JACQUES the diving plaque, it reads 280 feet.

JOHANA and JACQUES smile at each other.  JACQUES has won

his bet.

ENZO slaps him on the shoulder.

ENZO walks off then turns back toward them.  He whispers

in JACQUES' ear.

A beat.

ENZO walks off.

INT.  HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Three formally dressed officials are waiting in front of

one of the hotel rooms.  One of them holds a medal in his

hand, a glass of champagne in the other.

JACQUES and JOHANA walk up from the other side of the hall

and stop in front of the same door.

JACQUES knocks on the door.

A beat.  Then ENZO opens the door himself.

The officials look at each other baffled.

He looks inquisitively at the three men.  ENZO looses his

temper.

He slams the door in their face.

INT.  HOTEL - ENZO'S ROOM - NIGHT

ENZO takes JACQUES by the shoulder.  Inside his room is

absolute chaos:  dancing, singing, eating.  Wet suits hung

out to dry everywhere.  MAMMA MOLINARI is whipping up

mountains of spaghetti on an improvised stove in the

middle of the room.  A lot of smoke... steam... color...

noise... All of Italy crammed into a few square feet.

JOHANA taken in by the warm atmosphere, sits in a corner

of the room.  JACQUES walks over and sits down at her

side.

She points at ROBERTO who is taking forever to grate the

cheese.  ENZO grabs the guitar from his other brother's

hands and starts playing.

ENZO laughs then sees his mother.

ENZO starts singing in Italian.  MAMMA MOLINARI serves the

pasta, ROBERTO follows her around, sprinkling his cheese

on the plates.  She serves JOHANA a huge plate of pasta,

enough for three giants.

JOHANA who isn't even hungry, grins uncertainly.  JACQUES

has walked up to ENZO.  He doesn't dare ask his question.

ENZO laughs.  JACQUES is serious.

INT.  CORRIDOR - NIGHT

The three officials are eating pasta, plates on their

knees.  Their mouths are too full to speak, they nod

enthusiastically.

MAMMA MOLINARI smiles and slams the door.

INT.  FIAT - NIGHT

JACQUES is driving, JOHANA sits beside him.  ENZO crammed

in the back seat, very uncomfortably, because of a

stretcher which takes up all the space.

They are dressed as they were at ENZO'S party.

JACQUES runs a red light.

EXT.  MARINELAND PARKING LOT - FIAT - NIGHT

They get out of the car.  JACQUES starts to change into

his swimming trunks.  ENZO shakes his head, can't believe

he's really come along.  He laughs and starts undressing.

INT./ EXT.  FIAT - STREET TAORMINA - NIGHT

It's a very narrow street.  The car moves down it quickly.

JACQUES drives.  The back seat is now occupied by the

dolphin.  Its nose and tail protruding through the

windows.

JOHANA is in the front seat, turned around, spraying the

dolphin with a watering can.

EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT

They have driven to the public beach.  They slowly lower

the stretcher into the water.  The dolphin, leaving the

stretcher, swims around a little but won't go away.

He won't leave JACQUES.

JACQUES swims off with her for a while.

ENZO walks back toward the car with the stretcher.

JOHANA, standing by the water looks at JACQUES and the

dolphin who are swimming off together.

JACQUES keeps splashing the dolphin as they swim.

JACQUES cannot get rid of the dolphin.

JACQUES and the dolphin can't seem to part.

JOHANA is worried, she walks up to ENZO who goes back into

the water and takes JACQUES by the arm.

The dolphin starts swimming off.  JACQUES follows ENZO

half-heartedly.

EXT.  JOHANA'S PENSION - NIGHT

ENZO stops the FIAT in front of the pension.  The three of

them get out.  ENZO hasn't bothered to dress.

JOHANA heads for the gate, she obviously has no desire of

leaving JACQUES.

She looks over at the pension, having a hard time

concealing her lack of enthusiasm.

She rings the bell for the concierge, then looks back at

JACQUES.

The concierge comes out and opens the iron gate for her.

JOHANA disappears into the parc.  ENZO turns to JACQUES.

EXT.  SEA - DAY

The sun is rising on a rough sea.  The Committee Boat is

anchored in the open sea, 600 feet above the sea bed.

EXT.  COMMITTEE BOAT - BAY OF TAORMINA - DAY

JACQUES who is on the foredeck of a boat at sea has just

laid a towel down before him.  He's suited up, sitting in

the lotus position, staring straight ahead, clearly self-

hypnotized.

JOHANA, NOVELLI, and other officials are in the stern of

the boat watching last minute preparations.

The scuba divers in brightly colored wetsuits and

aqualungs, flop out onto the diving platform, plunge into

the water, disappear.

JOHANA sees scuba divers with weird air tanks.

INT.  BOAT - DAY - LATER

On the boat, NOVELLI checks his watch.  JACQUES comes out

of his room.  He's dressed to dive.  He ignores everyone

as he goes down the ladder to the diving platform.  He

seems to be in another world.  All sounds coming to him

are drowned out.

EXT.  DIVING PLATFORM - DAY

JACQUES sits in the diver's slot.  Opens his eyes slowly

and looks around.  He puts his flippers on, an assistant

stands at his side.

HIS POV

The figures on the platform are vague, the VOICES are

GARBLED and incomprehensible.  Moving almost in slow

motion he raises three fingers.

BACK TO SCENE

Ten other divers have waited for this signal to dive.

They disappear one by one into the blue.

JACQUES uses contact lenses instead of a mask.  He puts

them in, and now, his view of the world is as distorted as

his hearing... bodies deform... sounds fade...

Already euphoric from the vast amount of oxygen in his

system, he moves into another reality altogether... seems

to empty himself out.

JACQUES fills a small tube with water.  Pours it into his

nostrils... tilts his head... then lets it run out... He

puts on his gloves... all his movements are slow, he seems

to be operating in a different time zone... He seems

unable to take his eyes off the water.

EXT.  END OF DIVING PLATFORM - DAY

JACQUES puts his nose clip on.  He puts his hand on the

gueuse.  Closes his eyes and inhales slowly.  Then he

takes a sudden last breath, nods, the technician releases

the gueuse and in one flashing movement, he disappears.

UNDERWATER

The gueuse slides down the cable.  JACQUES hangs on like a

ribbon in the wind, past a marker, 90 feet down.

Above him, the boat disappears from sight.

He moves faster and faster... through a sea that looks

like a cloudy sky.  The light fades rapidly around him.

Below, white spotlights pierce an ocean dark as night.

JACQUES reaches them in a matter of seconds.  Turns the

brakes, brings his machine to a halt, 180 feet down.

The medics are waiting for him there.  They take his

pulse.  Check his eyes... 15 seconds... normal... the

bubbles from there scuba tanks churn the water around

them...

JACQUES closes his eyes... a tap on the shoulder, he

releases the brake on the gueuse.  Plunges further, this

time into pitch black.

Below him a faint spotlight glows on the bottom.  He

reaches it and the dark diver moves to him.  JACQUES

brakes his machine.  Moving very slowly, turns his body

right side up.  Like a sleep walker, JACQUES starts to

take the plaque off the plumbline... pauses in the middle

of the gesture.

The dark diver flashes the high sign to JACQUES, thumb and

forefinger touching, fingers extended, all clear.  JACQUES

does not respond.  The diver repeats the signal.  JACQUES

does not respond.

The diver taps JACQUES on the shoulder... a beat... and

then JACQUES responds, thumb and forefinger touching okay.

Slowly, reluctantly, he wraps his hand around the handle

of the balloon.

The dark diver quickly turns the handle for him.  The

balloon inflates.  JACQUES hangs on... lets it carry him

up.

At the plague marking 210 feet, JACQUES lets go of the the

balloon.  With a burst of speed, it darts toward the

surface.

JACQUES follows slowly, undulating like a fish... He's

getting warm now... He closes his eyes.

Passes the medical control without stopping... without

even seeing it like someone asleep.

He's moving faster now, toward the warmth, toward the air.

JACQUES opens his eyes, watches the lights grow brighter.

The silhouette of the boat comes back into view.  60 feet

to go.

EXT.  DIVING PLATFORM - DAY

In slow motion JACQUES' hand holding the plaque breaks out

of the water followed by his arm, in one continuous

movement, his shoulders and head.

He gasps for air.

A trickle of blood comes from his nose.

Flashbulbs flicker, spectators cheer.

EXT.  OPEN SEA - A DOLPHIN

The dolphin, the one rescued last night, leaps into the

air, in perfect harmony with JACQUES' triumph.

EXT.  DOLPHINARIUM

The dolphins in the dolphinarium leap into the air at the

exact same moment.

The trainer doesn't understand what's going on.

EXT.  DIVING PLATFORM - DAY

JACQUES falls back into the water.  Two divers run over

and pull him up onto the dock.

JACQUES seems completely dazed, almost in a trance.  He

slowly comes to and starts screaming louder and louder.

It is the scream of his body in need of the surface,

reality and the feel of the land.

JOHANA is terrified.  She can hardly breathe.  Everybody

applauds.

EXT.  HOTEL DOCK - DAY

JACQUES and JOHANA walk down the gangway.  NOVELLI has

lead the way and the news has been spread.

JACQUES looks very weak and punchy.

JOHANA holds him up.

The spectators applaud as he goes by.  Intrigued, JACQUES

looks at them all.

He doesn't respond.

He is staring at her, he's returning to the real world.

Slowly he smiles.

She grabs hold of his arm and gives him a proud kiss on

the mouth.  JACQUES is a little stunned.

EXT.  TERRACE - SWIMMING POOL - DAY

ENZO walks into the hotel, his arms filled with packages.

He sees JACQUES and JOHANA.  From the look on his face we

can tell he knows that JACQUES has beaten his record.  He

deliberately puts on a huge smile as he walks over to

them.

INT.  TERRACE - SWIMMING POOL

He drops his packages on the bar and gives Jacques a big

hug.

He kisses him and starts handing out his presents.

He holds up his arm:  he is wearing two watches.

JACQUES opens his present.  It's a little ceramic dolphin.

JOHANA has opened her package.  It's a big plate with a

text engraved on it.

JACQUES has opened the last small package.  It's a

measuring tape.  He looks at it without understanding.

ENZO explains:

He grabs hold of the tape and lets it roll to the ground.

JACQUES looks at him without saying a word.

ENZO hands him the measuring tape.

ENZO taps his shoulder and smiles.

INT.  ELEVATOR ASCENDING - JACQUES - JOHANA

They're locked in a long kiss.  He untucks the bottom of

her shirt and slides his hands under it.

INT.  HOTEL ROOM - JACQUES - JOHANA - TWILIGHT

They're in bed, making love in their fashion.  Moonlight

shines in the silver sea.  In the background are the

lights of the bay of TAORMINA.

LATER

JACQUES is in bed with JOHANA.  They are both asleep.

Suddenly, he sits up, as he always does after his

recurrent dream.

He's wide awake, looks over at her sleeping.  She sleeps

peacefully like a baby.  Quietly, gently, he eases out of

bed and walks to the open window.

He stands on the balcony, staring at the sea.  Then in the

distance in the moonlight, a dolphin leaps out of the

water, once, twice, a third time.

JACQUES laughs and goes back to the bed where he sits down

next to JOHANA.  She is still sound asleep.

EXT.  HOTEL - PIER - NIGHT

JACQUES quickly gets into one of his diving suits.  He

puts on his flippers.  The dolphin is still jumping in and

out of the water.  JACQUES jumps off the pier and swims

over to her.

INT.  JACQUES' HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

JOHANA rolls over and feels the bed in her sleep.

JACQUES' absence wakes her.

She gets up and walks over to the balcony.  She doesn't

see anything.

EXT.  PIER - NIGHT

JOHANA walks down the pier and notices the little pile of

clothes JACQUES has left behind.  She looks around but

still can't see anything.  She decides to sit next to the

pile of clothes, and waits, her eyes riveted to the sea.

EXT.  PIER - DAWN

The sky has just begun to light up again.  JOHANA is still

sitting next to the pile of clothes.

She is wearing JACQUES' sweater.  She looks sad, yet

serene.  The look of a woman who has been thinking over

the situation and who has made up her mind.

Tired, JACQUES swims back to the pier.  It looks as if he

has come out of nowhere.

He is exhausted.  He takes off his flippers and gets up

onto the pier in front of JOHANA.  He looks at her, a

little surprised to find her there.

She answers in a far away voice, with the same serene

sadness.

Dripping with water, he sits down next to her.  His face

is drawn from fatigue.  She continues.

She looks at him for a moment, then takes his face in her

hands and rests it on her bosom, as if a small child.

INT.  TRAIN STATION - JACQUES - JOHANA - DAY

The train station faces the sea.  JACQUES and JOHANA are

standing on the platform, amid others.  In the distance we

hear the rumble and whistle of a train.

JOHANA gets on the train.  The station master blows his

whistle.

JOHANA'S eyes are filled with tears.

The train starts pulling out of the station.

JOHANA doesn't answer.  JACQUES stands helplessly in the

station, his eyes filled with tears.

INT.  ENZO'S ROOM - DAY

ENZO opens the door of his suite.  His hair is messed up,

he's got "sheet prints" on his face and is wearing the top

of a diving suit.

ENZO walks back into the apartment and crashes on the bed.

He's lying on his stomach.  JACQUES walks in and lets

himself drop in a chair.

ENZO closes his eyes.  JACQUES looks over at the clock, it

says 11:25.  JACQUES doesn't say anything and stares

blankly out of the window.

JACQUES doesn't answer.

JACQUES stares out the window.

No answer.  ENZO gets up and sits on the side of the bed.

He pats him on the back.

EXT.  OIL DRILLING PLATFORM - AT SEA - DAY

The platform shines in the morning light.

There are several stories of crew housing and offices

above the deck.  Long steel legs disappear into the

swelling slate-gray ocean.  We hear WHOP-WHOP-WHOP of a

helicopter.

EXT.  HELICOPTER - PLATFORM

The helicopter is landing.  Crewmen rush to secure it to

the oil rig's deck.  Doors open and two passengers get

off:  JACQUES and ENZO.  They each carry a duffel bag of

personal belongings.  They're both wearing fluorescent

diving suits.

The DRILLING SUPERINTENDENT comes to meet them.

They nod.

The SUPERINTENDENT smiles sourly, and gestures to a

crewman.

Five minutes later, JACQUES and ENZO are following the

crewman.

INT.  DIVING CAPSULE - DAY

The diving capsule, suspended by cables, begins its

descent through a trap door in the deck.  It plunges into

the sea.

The three men in the capsule are:  JACQUES, ENZO and the

tough looking CAPSULE COMMANDER NOIREUTER, who is much too

professional for ENZO'S tastes.

ENZO watches through a porthole while the COMMANDER

concentrates on the control console.  He runs through a

checklist of systems.  JACQUES responds with a "check" as

he verifies each one.  ENZO is already bored and fed up by

the procedures.

JACQUES is lost in thought, they don't look cheerful.

JACQUES doesn't answer.  ENZO goes on.

He takes a cigarette from a pouch in his diving suit and

stares at NOIREUTER.

ENZO smiles sardonically, shaking his head very slowly.

The COMMANDER'S answer explains it all.

INT.  DRILLING PLATFORM - CONTROL ROOM - DAY

A technician is overlooking the capsule descent on a

video screen.

The SUPERINTENDENT watches over the technician's shoulder.

INT.  DIVING CAPSULE - DAY

ENZO, a cigarette dangling from his lips, looks through

the porthole.

INT.  CAPSULE - DAY

The technician fiddles with a few knobs.

INT.  DIVING CAPSULE

The diving capsule ends its descent.  The COMMANDER turns

to ENZO and JACQUES who is still staring out the porthole.

ENZO bursts out laughing.

ENZO and JACQUES burst out laughing.  They keep these same

voice till the end of the scene.

ENZO pulls out a tiny silver flask out of his pocket.

ENZO taps a drop onto JACQUES' finger, then on his own.

Then NOIREUTER blows up.

ENZO pours a second drop on his own finger.

JACQUES hesitates.  ENZO has no qualms about it and sucks

his own finger.  NOIREUTER is petrified.

JACQUES, convinced sucks his finger too.  ENZO smiles.

The alcohol has an immediate effect on them.

UNDERWATER

ENZO gets out of the diving capsule, head first.

He is connected to the capsule by a number of cables.

JACQUES, who follows him, gets completely tangled up in

them.  They are both hilariously drunk.

INT.  DRILLING PLATFORM - CONTROL ROOM

The SUPERINTENDENT hears them laughing through the control

room speakers.  He flips a communication switch.

The technician nods back to him.

UNDERWATER

The two divers have gotten to the spot they are supposed

to be working on.  They have their arms around each other

and are dancing.

NOIREUTER watches them through the porthole.  He shakes

his head in complete disbelief.

INT.  CONTROL ROOM

We hear the two friends humming the tune of a Viennese

waltz.

INT.  JOHANA'S APARTMENT

SALLY is talking away, pointing around the apartment.

INT.  DOCTOR'S OFFICE - JOHANA - DAY

The doctor enters with a folder, speaks to JOHANA

JOHANA breaks into a wide grin.

INT.  DUFFY'S OFFICE - DUFFY - DAY

DUFFY is at his desk.  His lunch is spread out in front of

him.  Outside the window, the window-washers are eating

their lunch too.  JOHANA hurries in.

She starts to leave... calls out to the window-washers.

INT.  JOHANA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

JOHANA stares out of the bay window of her Manhattan

apartment.  Hesitant, she walks around her telephone.

Finally she makes up her mind, picks up her address book

and dials the number.

INT.  JACQUES' APARTMENT

JACQUES is on the telephone, in front of a little window

overlooking the sea.  He is very glad to hear her voice.

INT.  JOHANA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

JOHANA'S face lights up with a huge smile.

LATER

JOHANA is still on the phone, sitting in front of the bay

window.  Day is dawning.

JOHANA smiles.  She stretches, lies down on the carpeted

floor.  JACQUES seems to have gone through all topics of

conversation.

JOHANA is by now completely stretched out on the floor.

He turns around and sits on the window sill, his feet

dangling in mid air.

He looks at the sea, seeking inspiration.

JOHANA listens with the abandon of a child being put to

sleep.

INT.  JACQUES' ROOM - ANTIBES

The sun hits the roof tops.  The sea is sparkling.

The phone rings on the window sill.  JACQUES answers.

JACQUES smiles.

JACQUES doesn't know what to say.  He looks around him,

can't figure out what to do.

INT.  AIRPORT - DAY

JOHANA is standing in front of the airport.

JACQUES sees her.  They smile shyly at each other.

EXT.  STREET - NICE - OPPOSITE THE NEGRESCO HOTEL

JACQUES and JOHANA are sitting in the back of a taxi.  The

driver stops in front of the hotel.

JACQUES and JOHANA look at each other.

INT.  HOTEL ROOM - JACQUES - JOHANA - DAY

The room is in semi-darkness, despite the blazing sunlight

coming through cracks in the shutters.  JACQUES and JOHANA

are making love.  JACQUES is on top of her, his whole body

covered in sweat.  The rumpled sheets and the movements of

their bodies suggest the movements of the sea.  ALL SOUNDS

are disproportionate and slightly distorted, they are

underwater...

ALL JOHANA'S reluctance has vanished.  Both of them act

like people who have never felt anything like this before.

A certain astonishment at the depth of their feeling.  An

increasing freedom.  All the muscles of their bodies

stretch to their limits.

JACQUES, progressively, finds himself disappearing.  His

image dissolves point by point... disintegrates into

unbroken blue... The effect creates the impression of

someone melting, the screen is now totally blue.

A thin, HIGH-PITCHED SOUND.

From the bottom of the image, a tiny pinpoint starts

TOWARD the CAMERA.  It is JACQUES, naked, swimming out of

the deep blue ocean toward the light as if he were coming

out of a dive.  He comes CLOSER and CLOSER to the

CAMERA...

Until his head almost touches the lens...

A sudden DEAFENING NOISE... and we find JACQUES on top of

JOHANA.  He looks down at her, speechless.

After a long beat.

INT.  APARTMENT BUILDING - ANTIBES - DAY

JACQUES and JOHANA step out of the elevator of a 19th

century building.

JACQUES is carrying her suitcases.

JACQUES rings the door bell and sticks his key in the

door.

JACQUES nods and pushes the door open with the bags he's

carrying.  They enter a huge, very old apartment filled

with models and paintings of boats.

JACQUES leads JOHANA to the other end of the apartment.

INT.  BATHROOM - ON UNCLE LOUIS (SORT OF)

It's a huge old-fashioned bathroom.  The centerpiece is a

deep ancient bathtub on faded gild feet.  There's a

rippling shadow of a body under the bath water.

JOHANA gasps.

He goes to the tub and pinches the end of a tube.  UNCLE

LOUIS, underwater, has been breathing through it.  LOUIS'

head pops out of the water, furious.

LOUIS climbs out of the bathtub, and pulls on a bathrobe.

Behind him he's pulling two insulated wires out of the

bathtub.  We see that they're connected to small

underwater speakers.  As they surface, incredibly LOUD

MUSIC BLASTS:  the finale of the "1812 Overture",

(trumpets, timpani, cannons, etc...) The sound fills the

room, the apartment, and probably all of ANTIBES.

INT.  DINING ROOM - JACQUES - JOHANA - LOUIS - LATER

The three of them are at the table.  There are a few

scraps on their plates on a threadbare lace tablecloth.

Incredibly LOUD SYMPHONIC MUSIC is PLAYING.  LOUIS is as

deaf as a fence post.

Everyone has to scream over the music.

JACQUES stands up and lowers the music.

INT.  BEDROOM - JACQUES - JOHANA

JACQUES' room looks like a diving equipment storage room

with a bed in it.  JACQUES notices JOHANA'S gaze.

EXT.  PORT OF ANTIBES - DAY

JACQUES, JOHANA and ROBERTO are waiting at the port.

JACQUES turns around.  UNCLE LOUIS is a few yards behind

them at a fish stand on the dock.  He's holding up an eel

and screaming at the fishmonger.

JACQUES shrugs his shoulders and gives up on the idea of

interfering.

A speed boat races along the water.  It's a beautiful

highly-varnished mahogany Riva.  It races into the port.

Standing at the helm, looking like Christopher Columbus

his hair brushed back by the wind, is ENZO.

Next to him hanging on to the windscreen is an impressive

six foot, dark haired beauty.  She has a scarf over her

hair.  She wears a purple leather micro-mini with a cerise

halter top and her ruby fingernails are three inches long.

If she ever actually would get cast in a movie, she'd make

Raquel Welch hide in shame.  Her stage name is BONITA

MARIPOSA.

ENZO kills the THROTTLE, swings the speedboat into a

perfect landing at the dock.  ROBERTO takes the lines.

During all of this, everyone's attention is actually on

BONITA who is tugging at her long black hair.  They're all

awestruck except for ROBERTO.

ENZO glances at his watch and sighs with relief.  BONITA

says hello to JACQUES, kisses JOHANA.

INT.  LIVING ROOM IN JACQUES' APARTMENT - DAY

Loud classical music booms from the stereo.  The noise

pins JACQUES, ENZO and ROBERTO to their chairs.

UNCLE LOUIS gets a bottle of whiskey and serves everybody.

UNCLE LOUIS pours him a whiskey.

The bottle is empty.  UNCLE LOUIS goes to the kitchen.

JACQUES turns down the music, and finally hears the bell

which has been ringing.  JACQUES opens the apartment door:

it's Professor LAWRENCE.  Suit and tie and carrying a

bottle.

ENZO and LAWRENCE shake hands.

INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT

JOHANA comes into the bathroom, closes the door, cutting

down the blaring music.  The paint is peeling off the

ceiling.

BONITA is standing under a 40 watt lamp, putting on make-

up in front of JACQUES' cracked shaving mirror.

JOHANA walks over to the mirror and watches BONITA put on

her make-up like a professional.

BONITA stops working on her make-up and looks pensively at

JOHANA.

BONITA looks at her with the same pensive look.

JOHANA goes on.

Unconvinced, JOHANA nods.  She changes the subject.

EXT.  TERRACE OF RESTAURANT - NIGHT

The "problem":  MAMMA MOLINARI sits between ENZO and

ROBERTO, looking like a malevolent storm cloud, staring

across at BONITA.

There's an interminable awkward silence.  Then UNCLE LOUIS

at last finds his way to the table.  JACQUES who is too

grateful for the interruption springs to his feet.

MAMMA MOLINARI is having trouble breathing.

All of them are gasping for air, trying so hard not to

laugh.

They all burst out laughing.

EXT.  COMMITTEE BOAT AT SEA - DAY

The diving platform is out.  The competition has begun.

ENZO is at the gueuse, getting ready to dive.  ROBERTO

works around him busily.

BONITA on deck above him is making little gestures of

encouragement.  ENZO isn't amused.

Other competitors watch from the Committee Boat.

ENZO turns the handle on the gueuse, plunges into the

water.

Professor LAWRENCE, taking notes, stands a few feet away.

UNDERWATER - ON ENZO

He dives down, further and further down.  He approaches

the two medics in aqualungs at the control point (210

feet).

They move toward him.

EXT.  DIVING PLATFORM - ENZO

Surfacing.  Assistants help him onto the platform.

ROBERTO pulls off his fins.  ENZO rips off his mask.  He

looks furious.  He tosses the depth plaque (which proves

he is qualified) back into the water.

He looks around angrily for an official.  Sees NOVELLI.

He keeps on walking across the boat, runs into JACQUES,

who's just about to begin his yoga preparation.

JACQUES sees ENZO'S expression, looks concerned.

ENZO stamps into one of the cabins.

INT.  JACQUES' APARTMENT - NIGHT

JOHANA is reading a child birth catalog.  She throws it

away upside down, as soon as she hears JACQUES

approaching.  JACQUES comes in and sits opposite her.  He

seems bitter.

In an involuntary gesture, JACQUES flips through the

catalog.

JOHANA wonders if JACQUES will understand the presence of

the baby magazine.

He goes away.

He hasn't heard.

JACQUES goes to the bedroom, and throws himself on the

bed.

JOHANA looks as if she had wished he'd put two and two

together.

EXT.  COMMITTEE BOAT AT SEA - DAY

ENZO bursts out of the water.  He rips off his face mask,

throws it on the diving platform, roaring with pleasure.

He tosses the depth plague to ROBERTO.

INT.  JACQUES' APARTMENT - DAY

JOHANA opens the apartment door.  BONITA is standing

there, a suitcase in one hand.

They kiss each other goodbye.

JOHANA is very uncomfortable.

BONITA grabs the note back and tears it up.

The two women hug again.

BONITA rests her hand on JOHANA'S stomach.

BONITA smiles at her and disappears down the stairs.

EXT.  COMMITTEE BOAT - DOCKING - DAY

Officials, NOVELLI, LAWRENCE, ROBERTO and of course ENZO

disembark.  There is a lot of excitement on the dock.

Everyone has already heard the news.

People swarm around ENZO.

LAWRENCE spots JACQUES in the crowd, and goes to him.

JACQUES sees ENZO being carried past on the shoulders of

the crowd.  He ignores LAWRENCE, runs beside ENZO.

EXT.  AWARD CEREMONY - NIGHT

ENZO and NOVELLI stand on a little stage facing the crowd.

ENZO is holding a gold trophy, waving to friends in the

audience.

While the attentive crowd listens to NOVELLI, ENZO is

gesturing to ROBERTO, explaining what appetizers he wants

from the cocktail trays.

The crowd laughs.

There's wild applause.  ENZO lifts the trophy over his

head, smiles like a champ and yells into the microphone.

EXT.  COMMITTEE BOAT - DAY

ENZO and ROBERTO are on the front deck watching the

divers.

A German diver comes up to the surface, empty handed.

ENZO smiles.

The Tahitian comes out of the water in a semi-coma.  The

doctors carry him away.  Once he's sure that the diver is

out of danger, ENZO smiles again.

A whole team of Japanese walk over to the diving platform.

The team consists of one diver and six assistants, three

of them playing music to help the diver concentrate.  The

diver wears a white wet suit with a red circle on his

forehead.  He is concentrating very hard, so much that

ENZO walks over to him to make sure he's okay.  The

Japanese diver concentrates with such strength that he

faints.

ROBERTO smiles.

The diver from the Philippines stands at the end of the

diving platform.  He concentrates for a moment then gives

up and walks away.

INT.  BEDROOM - JACQUES - JOHANA - NIGHT

They're in bed, side by side, both of them half asleep.

The only light in the room comes from the open windows.

He rolls over and watches her sleep, looking down at her

adoringly.  He slips off the chain with the gold coin.

Slowly, holding the chain, he runs the coin gently over

her body, stops at the level of her stomach and lets it

rest there.  She opens her eyes and looks at him,

wondering if he senses something.

She smiles, closes her eyes.  He swings the coin over her

face gently, some kind of private ceremony.  She looks

just a little intimidated.

The coin is now dangling in front of her mouth.  She

hesitates then opens her mouth, JACQUES lets the coin

slide into it.

EXT.  COMMITTEE BOAT - DAY

JACQUES walks up to the diving platform.

LAWRENCE has fixed scientific equipment on his chest.

JACQUES wets and slowly puts them on.

ENZO watches from the deck, his expression has changed.

JOHANA, on the deck also, opposite ENZO, watches a little

worried.  JACQUES concentrates then releases the gueuse

and lets himself disappear under the water.

UNDERWATER

JACQUES dives down very fast.  The control takes place at

200 feet, the doctors check him and let him go.  He

continues his descent, it's getting darker and darker

around him.

The gueuse stops at the level of the underwater platform,

just below the diver, who swims over to him in a sea of

bubbles from his oxygen bottles.  He asks JACQUES if he is

alright, JACQUES nods and gives him a huge smile before

swimming off, downwards!

The diver realizes and starts after him.  He grabs JACQUES

by one of his fins and pulls him back to the round

platform.  JACQUES lets go of the balloon.

The diver panics.  JACQUES slowly motions that everything

is fine and slowly paddles up to the surface.

EXT.  COMMITTEE BOAT - DAY

The boat's huge stop watch indicates min:  4:50, then

5:00, then 5:10.  JACQUES has been down there for over 5

minutes.

JOHANA is worried sick.  ENZO doesn't know what to make of

it and LAWRENCE feels completely helpless.  The stopwatch

indicates 5:20, then 5:25 and JACQUES, half unconscious,

brakes through the surface of the water.

JOHANA screams and cries with joy when she sees him.  The

crowd applauds.  ENZO is somber.

NOVELLI takes the plaque from JACQUES' hands and turns to

the crowd.

The crowd cheers in excitement.

ENZO is sullen.  LAWRENCE is very worried.

EXT.  ON PORT - END OF THE DAY

There's a pile of gear on the dock.

ENZO is in the boat loading one piece of luggage at a

time, JACQUES comes up to the boat.  Parked in the

background, we see a taxi waiting with JOHANA sitting in

the back seat.  ENZO pretends not to notice JACQUES'

arrival.

JACQUES watches him for a moment then finally dares to

speak.

ENZO keeps loading up the boat.

ENZO throws the last duffel bag into the cockpit.

ENZO turns around and jumps onto his boat.

JACQUES walks off the dock, past the cab.  JOHANA opens

the door to let him in, but he keeps walking.

He walks off.

EXT.  MARINELAND - DOLPHIN POOL - ANTIBES - NIGHT

The park is empty as JACQUES approaches the pool.

TINA the dolphin, jumps out of the water, swims to meet

JACQUES.  JACQUES pats her and kneels to talk to TINA

NINA.

The dolphin giggles.

The dolphin nods "yes".

JACQUES smiles.

The dolphin nods.

The dolphin nods and giggles.

Again the dolphin nods "yes".

A beat.  Then the dolphin nods "yes".

The two other dolphins stick their heads out of the water.

They all nod together.

JACQUES is awed and perplexed at the same time.

EXT.  AMORGOS - DAY

The little town of Amorgos is beautiful, mountainous.

It's surrounded by a luminous turquoise sea, with white

villas clinging to hillsides.  There is a small port.  (we

saw it in the opening sequence) Further along the coast,

we see the Diving Federation Committee Boat surrounded by

all sorts of activity.

INT.  HOTEL ROOM - JACQUES - JOHANA - DAY

Through the open windows we can see parts of the village

where JACQUES grew up.  He's staring out the window, lost

in his own thoughts.

Behind him, JOHANA is hiding and throwing up.  He walks to

her.

While JACQUES gets her the water, JOHANA stares at the

view.

EXT.  ENZO'S BOAT - IN THE LITTLE PORT

ROBERTO stands on the port, waiting for his brother.

Suddenly the sound of a motor boat and twelve note horn

echoes in the bay.

The boat has just arrived at the town dock.

ENZO, tears rolling down his cheeks from the wind, throws

a duffel bag on the dock and looks up at ROBERTO.

ENZO makes a face.

EXT.  SMALL PORT - DAY

JOHANA sits on the little dock in front of the hotel.

JACQUES pulls on his fins, looks out into the water.

She clutches a stopwatch, ready to set it off.

A few yards behind, hidden between two bungalows, ENZO

watches them.  JACQUES takes a few deep breaths and dives

a few feet underwater.

JOHANA starts the stopwatch.

ENZO, who sees JACQUES disappear, walks over to JOHANA and

sits down beside her.

JOHANA shakes her head negatively.

They jump up.  ENZO dives into the water.

As JOHANA watches panicky, ENZO pulls JACQUES up onto the

dock, in his arms.  JACQUES is unconscious.

ENZO is furious.  The fear of loosing his friend has

absolutely enraged him.  He starts pacing up and down the

dock.

Once again he marches off, then comes back.

A few steps away, then coming back.

ENZO stalks off defiantly.

EXT.  COMMITTEE BOAT - ANCHORED OFF THE COAST

There's activity.  The competition has begun.

MUSIC

A SERIES OF QUICK SHOTS of different competitors at

various points in their dives.

The Tahitian comes up unconscious.

The German comes up unconscious.

So does the diver from the Philippines.

NOVELLI doesn't know what to think.

EXT.  TERRACE OF RESTAURANT - JACQUES - JOHANA - SUNSET

JACQUES is in a T-shirt and jeans, rope-sole sandals.

JOHANA wears a light white cotton dress.  They both sit on

the restaurant's terrace overlooking the sea.

Below them, a small boat passes.  In it are baskets filled

with sponges.  JACQUES stares at them for a long time.

A beat.

JOHANA wants to say something.

JOHANA has never looked so sad and lost.

JACQUES doesn't notice.

ENZO who is sitting at the piano behind them, starts to

play, staring at the sea.

JACQUES and JOHANA turn around and look at him.

EXT.  COMMITTEE BOAT UNDERWAY - ON JACQUES

He's alone in the bow.  The others are clustered in the

saloon, cockpit in the stern.  The boat is moving close to

the cliffs.  The monastery looms above them.

CLOSE ON JACQUES

He's scanning the apparently abandoned monastery searching

for signs of life.

A red and blue taxi-boat pulls up alongside the Committee

Boat.  In it, LAWRENCE waits to climb on board.

EXT.  DIVING PLATFORM - DAY

ENZO puts his flippers on and grabs his gueuse.  He is

serious, concentrating hard.

LAWRENCE'S boat slides along the big Committee Boat and

the DOCTOR climbs onto it.

INT.  COMMITTEE BOAT - LAWRENCE - NOVELLI - OTHERS

LAWRENCE'S briefcase is open.  There's a stack of graph

paper on a cabin table.

NOVELLI and the MEDIC look over at the diving platform

where ENZO is concentrating.

LAWRENCE doesn't answer.  NOVELLI is thinking.

EXT.  DIVING PLATFORM - ENZO

ENZO is preparing.  He sits at the edge of the platform

hyperventilating, almost in a trance.

We see JACQUES in the background, talking to NOVELLI, he

then walks over to ENZO and climbs down next to him.

ENZO opens one eye.

ENZO looks at him coldly.  Takes another deep breath.

He takes a last breath, signs himself and reaching for the

gueuse, disappears into the water.

LAWRENCE, NOVELLI, the MEDICS, and others are arguing.

LAWRENCE is furious that ENZO is diving.  NOVELLI is

balling out his assistants.

JACQUES is on the platform watching the others as if they

were a gaggle of geese.  He listens to the sound of the

gueuse playing out, watches the depth indicator, the

stopwatches.  He knows something is wrong.

He walks over to the edge and grabs hold of a little

oxygen bottle which is there for security.  He takes a few

breaths of the oxygen as he puts on his flippers and dives

down after ENZO.

UNDERWATER - JACQUES

JACQUES pulls himself down the cable, hand over hand.

80 or 90 feet down he sees a group of MEDICS coming toward

him carrying ENZO'S unconscious body.

JACQUES struggles with them, pushes them away, takes ENZO

in his arms and climbs toward the surface, frantic,

screaming silently at him, desperate to get away from the

flow of air bubbles from the scuba tanks, the commotion,

the memory of death.

ENZO has a big serene smile on his face.  The MEDICS push

both divers toward the surface.

As if they were on land, JACQUES starts shaking ENZO to

wake him up.  He then slaps his face but ENZO remains

unconscious.

They finally break the surface in each others arms.

EXT.  ON DIVING PLATFORM

They pull ENZO out of the water.  The doctors open his

jacket.  ENZO motions to JACQUES to come close.  He still

has that long smile.

He tries to take a deep breath, the effort is exhausting.

JACQUES smiles, holding back his tears.

His smile freezes, he stops breathing.  His eyes close.

JACQUES puts his head down on his friend's chest and sobs.

The doctors gently try to move him away, but JACQUES

resists.

LAWRENCE encourages everybody to leave the platform.

JACQUES quickly grabs the nearest rope and ties it to his

belt.  Before anybody can stop him, JACQUES rolls ENZO'S

body back into the water and dives after it.

UNDERWATER - JACQUES

He holds ENZO in his arms.  Lets the dead weight of the

body pull him down, deeper and deeper.  The rope around

JACQUES' waist runs out, stops his descent with an abrupt

jerk.  When he feels it, JACQUES lets go... watches as

ENZO'S body continues to drift by itself into the

bottomless blue...

EXT.  DIVING PLATFORM

The doctors have run over and are pulling the cable that

JACQUES is attached to.  He is unconscious when they pull

him up.  They hold him up by his feet.  JACQUES throws up

gallons of water.  They put an oxygen mask on his face.

Suddenly, everything collapses for JACQUES.  Sounds

disappear.  The image slows down, the light fades.

JACQUES only hears his heartbeat, which slows down.

His heart stops.

Among the crowd around him, he sees JOHANA, fresh, gentle,

smiling.  Her movements are smooth and slowed down.  She

smiles at him, simply.  JACQUES smiles back.  The heart

starts again slowly.

The image goes back to normal.

Sounds multiply (doctors, the panic, etc...) and slowly

come back.

JACQUES falls unconscious.

NOVELLI falls back in his chair, relieved.

INT.  JACQUES' ROOM - NIGHT

JACQUES is lying on the bed, he has a strong fever.

JOHANA sits at his feet.

LAWRENCE rummages through a medical kit.  He takes a pill

from a bottle and gives it to him.

JACQUES swallows the pills.  JOHANA walks over from the

balcony.

LAWRENCE motions to JOHANA that they should let him sleep.

He goes out of the room.

JOHANA bends over and kisses him.

JACQUES holds her by the arm, doesn't want her to leave.

JOHANA kisses him on the forehead and leaves the room.

EXT.  HOTEL BAR - ON TERRACE - LAWRENCE - JOHANA

They're at the little zinc bar.  Not talking, not really

drinking either, just toying with their glasses.

ROBERTO passes, stops.

They watch sadly as he leaves.

INT.  JACQUES ROOM - NIGHT

JACQUES sitting up in bed finally lies down under the

sheets.  He turns off the light by the bed.

INT.  HOTEL RESTAURANT - LAWRENCE - JOHANA

They've moved from the bar to the table.  There is uneaten

food in front of them.  A third place is set.

JOHANA looks at the wall clock.

INT.  JACQUES ROOM - JACQUES

JACQUES is lying on the bed, he is not moving anymore.  He

is breathing loudly, as if tired out.  From his POV the

room becomes very dark and blue.  The noise is unbearable.

The ceiling turns into water.

JACQUES' eyes are wide open.  His face is sweating.  The

water level, from the ceiling, comes down to him, until he

is swallowed by it.

As he falls into the water, we see a dolphin gulping air

at the surface and going back very quickly to the blue.

The dolphin meets his group, about ten of them, 250 Kg of

muscles, swimming at more than 40 km/H underwater.  They

all break through the surface to gulp air regularly.

Suddenly, one of them, leaves the group.  He crosses the

blue and seems to make sonar-like sounds.  We see a sonar

picture.  It's an image in which the dolphin will appear a

few seconds later.  The dolphin comes up like a rocket,

gulps air and goes back down.

The sonar image appears again.  Finally, the dolphin,

locates a group of fish and starts hunting them, exactly

like a war plane.  He manages to break the group in two,

then in four, and this way, he isolates his victim.

He breaks the surface to gulp air and goes back down.  He

goes full power.  The fish he is after are even more

divided.  There is only one left, totally lost and in a

panic.

The exhausted fish is swallowed.

The dolphin slows down, goes back up, breaks the surface

in slow motion.  Images becomes pale and bright.

He screams inhumanly.

Image is white, black, silence.

INT.  HOTEL ROOM - JACQUES

JOHANA opens the shutters.

The room is a shamble of broken glass, water pitcher and

glasses, lamps and vases.  The windows are blown out.

JACQUES is lying in bed.  There is a thin trickle of blood

coming from his nose and ears.

EXT.  DOCK - JACQUES - JOHANA - NIGHT

JACQUES jumps into ENZO'S boat.

She jumps down into ENZO'S boat.  He starts the engine.

The boat is racing out of the port.  JOHANA yells over the

sound of the engine.

JACQUES parks the boat in front of the COMMITTEE BOAT'S

DIVING PLATFORM.  He turns on the platform lights:  above

and underwater.  He throws down the diving cable:  60, 90,

120 feet...

JACQUES gets undressed and sits down in the lotus

position, concentrating...

JOHANA sits down a few feet away and watches him,

wondering just how far he is going to push this whole

thing.

As the cable unrolls, JOHANA starts crying.  She

understands that JACQUES is going to dive to the bottom,

into the blue, into himself.

JACQUES is putting on his flippers, and stands facing his

gueuse.

JOHANA starts pacing up and down the diving platform.

JACQUES has not moved, he still sits motionless, facing

his gueuse.

JOHANA doesn't know what to do or say.  She is totally

drained.

Silence.  JACQUES is petrified, without any reaction.  He

doesn't understand.  She realizes it's hopeless and stares

at the sea.

She kisses him.

She pulls the line releasing the gueuse.

JACQUES takes a deep breath and grabbing hold of the

gueuse, disappears into the water -- as if swallowed by

the ocean.

UNDERWATER

JACQUES slides along the cable, pulled by the weight of

the gueuse.  He has a beautiful smile on his face.  He is

in his element.  Night has closed in around him.  He turns

on the headlight of the gueuse, it casts a dim light

around him.

EXT.  DIVING PLATFORM - NIGHT

JOHANA has walked over to the edge of the platform.  She

is holding the cable, to "hear" JACQUES' descent.

The counter shows that JACQUES is quickly passing the 300

feet mark.

UNDERWATER

JACQUES keeps going down, as serene as ever.  He has

gained a lot of speed.

EXT.  DIVING PLATFORM - NIGHT

JOHANA holds her face in her hands.  The counter indicates

that JACQUES is going very fast.

UNDERWATER

The gueuse jerks to a stop and shakes the cable.  JACQUES

turns his body right side up.

EXT.  DIVING PLATFORM - NIGHT

The counter now indicates a depth of 600 feet.

JOHANA has felt the jolt of the cable.  She cries her

tears and looks down at the water.

UNDERWATER

The headlight on the gueuse illuminates only a few feet

around JACQUES, as if he were standing in a circle of

light.  He stays there, patiently floating around and

around his cable... as if he were waiting for something.

A long form circles the border between the darkness and

the light.

JACQUES holds out his hand.  A dolphin comes and presses

its body against it.  Two other dolphins come out of the

night.  JACQUES watches in amazement.

A dolphin lays his muzzle in JACQUES' hand, ready to lead

him off.  JACQUES hesitates.

JACQUES lets go of the cable and lets himself be led away.

Their silhouettes disappear in the deep blue night.
