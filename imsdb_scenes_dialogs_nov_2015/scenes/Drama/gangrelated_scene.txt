FADE IN:

NEON SIGN - THE PRINCE MOTEL - NIGHT

The N and the E are not working. So it reads the PR IC motel.

ROOMS TO RENT BY DAY, WEEK, MONTH. KITCHENETTES. The Prince

Motel has passed its prime. A few beat up cars are parked

outside rooms. We CRANE DOWN to ROOM SEVEN. Curtains closed,

but someone is holding it open a crack, looking out. We PUSH

in CLOSE TO THE WINDOW and the EYE looking over the parking

lot. Then the curtain closes.

INT. ROOM SEVEN - PRINCE MOTEL - NIGHT

Peeling flowered wallpaper, ultra-cheap furniture. The man

moving away from the window is RODRIGUEZ. He is slender,

sports a thin mustache, hair slicked straight back. He's in

his late thirties. Slightly nervous.

Another man sits on the couch, looking at a magazine. He is

forty, solidly built. His name is FRANK DIVINCI.

Rodriguez sits down.

Rodriguez stands up, moves back to the window. Divinci looks

up.

Divinci nods. Rodriguez looks at his watch.

Rodriguez shakes his head, exasperated, and exits.

EXT. DARK STREET - NIGHT

Poor side of town. A few old cars parked on the street. Some

buildings vacant. A LATE MODEL WHITE CADILLAC cruises past.

We HEAR LOUD RAP MUSIC.

INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT

LIONEL HUDD drives. Hudd is thirty. African American. The

MUSIC is loud. His clothes lean to African roots. A WOMAN

sits next to the passenger window. Her name is CYNTHIA WEBB.

Cynthia is thirty-five, dressed in short provocative skirt,

tight top. A little too much make-up. She's lead a hard life.

She glances at Hudd. Hudd glances at her, looks down at her

skirt hiked up on her leg.

Hudd's eyes linger on her thighs for a moment, then he turns

his attention back to driving, tapping along with the heavy

bass.

EXT. PRINCE MOTEL - NIGHT

The Cadillac pulls into the parking lot. Parks in front of

room SEVEN. Hudd gets out, looks around. Cynthia gets out,

leads him to SEVEN. Knocks.

The curtains pull back. Divinci looks at Hudd and Cynthia.

She nods to him. The door unlocks and opens.

Cynthia enters. Hudd looks around again. Then follows.

INT. MOTEL ROOM SEVEN - NIGHT

Divinci waits at the door. He and Hudd eye each other as

Hudd enters the room. Divinci looks out, making sure no one

has followed, then shuts the door.

Divinci hesitates. This could break the deal.

Hudd looks at Cynthia. The suggestion is taken.

Hudd spreads his legs, lifts his arms. Cynthia would rather

not have the job, but there's no choice.

Cynthia runs her hands over Hudd, checking pockets, pants,

sleeves. Finally coming to his crotch. Hudd smiles.

Cynthia has heard it all before. She's not squeamish in the

least and she gives him a good going over.

She smiles back at Hudd. Then moves away, sits on the couch

and seductively crosses her legs.

Divinci, satisfied, pulls a PLASTIC BAG packed tight with

COCAINE out of his pocket, tosses it to Hudd.

Hudd sits on the couch, opens the bag, sticks his finger in

and tastes the contents. But never takes his eyes off Divinci.

Hudd stands, unzips his pants. Reaches in to grab his cock,

but instead, pulls out a stack of MONEY. Inch thick.

Hudd hands the money to Divinci and pockets the plastic bag.

Then crosses to the door. Glances back at Cynthia.

Then Hudd smiles and exits.

EXT. PRINCE MOTEL - NIGHT

Hudd gets into his Cadillac, pulls out of the motel parking

lot.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Deserted. No one on the street this late. Several of the

buildings are boarded up.

INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT

Hudd drives. No music this time. His attitude has changed.

More serious. LIGHTS in the REAR VIEW MIRROR. Coming up fast.

Hudd watches as the car pulls around to pass.

He glances at the CAR as it pulls past him, but all we SEE

is the FLASH OF A BLAST FROM A GUN. Front WINDOW EXPLODING.

THE CADILLAC

swerves into a parked car. The OTHER CAR -- a BUICK REGAL --

screeches to a stop next to it. ONE MAN gets out. Moving

quickly to the Cadillac. It's dark, difficult to see. He

carries a SMITH AND WESSON .44. Opens the door. He's wearing

PLASTIC GLOVES.

Hudd is dead, slumped against the passenger door. The man

reaches in, turns off the engine, grabs the plastic bag of

cocaine. And now we see it's Divinci.

INT. BUICK REGAL - NIGHT

Rodriguez is the driver. Anxious. Engine running.

Divinci dashes back to the Buick, hops in. Rodriguez floors

it.

THE BUICK

tears off down the dark street.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Not a great part of the city. Apartment buildings line both

sides of the street. An alley runs between two of the

buildings. A TAXI pulls up in front. HEADLIGHTS SHINING on a

MAN passed out in the street.

Cynthia exits the taxi. The taxi pulls away. She glances at

the man passed out in the street.

His clothes are ragged. He's filthy. His face covered in

beard and greasy dirty hair. Hard to tell how old he is.

Maybe forty. Maybe eighty. Who knows? His hand clutches a

bottle in a bag.

She nudges him with her foot. The man groans, rolls back.

Dead drunk.

The man, JOE, is silent for a moment, then he starts to crawl --

toward the middle of the street.

Joe turns his crawl toward the curb. Cynthia watches him for

a moment. He is truly pathetic.

Cynthia enters the building next to the alley.

CYNTHIA - INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

asleep. The room is dark. We HEAR a door open and close.

Cynthia wakes.

Divinci crosses to the bed.

She closes her eyes, trying to go back to sleep.

Cynthia's eyes open and she looks up at Divinci. He's smiling,

holding up FIVE ONE HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS.

Divinci unzips his pants.

Divinci smiles. Cynthia snatches the money. Divinci starts

to undress.

Cynthia just stares at him for a long beat. Then she unbuckles

Divinci's pants.

KEY - INSERTED INTO DOOR LOCK - NIGHT

A door is pushed open. Rodriguez enters his one bedroom

apartment. Starts to shut the door when TWO MEN appear from

the shadows. The first is short, well dressed. His name is

VIC. The second is large, heavy-set, shaved head. His name

is CUTLESS SUPREME. Cutless Supreme is not a man to be messed

with.

Rodriguez looks at Cutless Supreme.

Rodriguez steps toward Vic, but Cutless Supreme slides in

between them. Rodriguez isn't going to win this one.

Rodriguez backs off, hesitates as he runs over his options.

There aren't any. He reaches into his pocket, pulls out some

of his night's earnings.

Vic takes the money, heads for the street. Rodriguez watches

Vic walk away. Cutless Supreme watches Rodriguez.

Rodriguez glares at Cutless Supreme, then he shuts the door.

CREDIT SEQUENCE - BLACK AND WHITE MONTAGE

CRIME SCENE PHOTOGRAPHS -- Dead drug dealers lying where

they were shot. Overlapping CLOSE-UPS of EVIDENCE TAGS and

SHELVING filled with EVIDENCE from hundreds of crime scenes.

And CLOSE-SHOTS of CRIME SCENES -- chalk outlines -- bullet

shells - bloody foot prints. And finally CRIME SCENE TAPE.

The BLACK AND WHITE fades back into COLOR --

YELLOW CRIME SCENE TAPE

surrounding the CADILLAC. We PULL BACK, revealing COPS

controlling the area. It's early morning. A FEW PEOPLE have

stopped to watch. But this is not a high traffic area.

ANOTHER CAR pulls up. Unmarked. Two men get out. We FOLLOW

BEHIND THEM as they approach the Cadillac and PATROLMAN

MAHONEY, who knows them.

And now we SEE THE TWO MEN from the unmarked car. It's DIVINCI

and RODRIGUEZ. Suit and ties. They act like they own the

area. And they do.

INT. CADILLAC - DAY

The bloody scene is untouched. Hudd's body is where it fell,

on the seat. Dried blood everywhere. Divinci looks in.

INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

EVIDENCE ROOM. Behind a locked fenced in area. A DESK OFFICER

checks in and out all evidence. He is twenty-eight, wears

glasses, very clean cut. TWO DETECTIVES are checking in

evidence as Divinci walks in.

The Desk Officer checks in the evidence.

The two detectives wave hellos to Divinci as he approaches.

The Desk Officer buzzes Divinci through the door. Divinci

crosses to the --

EVIDENCE STORAGE ROOM

-- filled with shelves. Stacked with evidence from on-going

investigations. And the shelves are full of guns, knives,

bloody gloves, masks, shoes, etc.

Divinci looks around, then removes the PACKAGE OF COCAINE

and the .44 from his pockets and places them back on one of

the shelves. CASE NUMBER C-549087. One thing about the .44

which we can see now -- a BLACK STAIN on the metal of the

handle.

INT. HOMICIDE SQUAD ROOM - DAY

Desks, phones, computers, typewriters and HOMICIDE DETECTIVES.

Some witnesses being interviewed. Rodriguez is on the phone

at his desk. He's in the middle of an interview as he fills

out one of the many forms that complicate his life.

Divinci comes back to his desk, next to Rodriguez. Rodriguez

looks up. Divinci gives him a confident smile and brushes

his hands together -- clean hands.

Divinci sits at his desk. He pulls an ADVERTISEMENT for a 42

FOOT SPORT FISHING BOAT out of his desk. He holds it up to

Rodriguez, points to the boat.

We can HEAR someone describing a felon over the phone, but

Rodriguez isn't listening. He's looking at the boat.

Divinci picks up the phone, starts to dial.

Divinci smiles. Rodriguez suddenly realizes the person on

the other end of the phone has stopped talking.

A heavy set man in his fifties approaches -- CAPTAIN

HENDERSON.

Captain Henderson doesn't wait for a response. He heads for

the office -- an inner office of glass and wood.

Divinci looks at Rodriguez, who is suddenly a little nervous.

We can HEAR the PERSON OVER THE PHONE that he's talking to,

but he's no longer interested and hangs up on them.

Divinci motions "keep calm."

INT. CAPTAIN HENDERSON'S OFFICE - DAY

Henderson is hanging up his coat as Divinci and Rodriguez

enter. They aren't the only ones in the office. RICHARD SIMMS,

thirty-two, trim, short cut hair, suit, is waiting.

Divinci pulls out his note pad.

Rodriguez and Divinci take the news like a sledgehammer. On

their frozen expressions we HEAR --

A long beat on Rodriguez and Divinci, then --

THE UNMARKED POLICE CAR - EXT. STREET - DAY

screeching around a corner and up a drive into a VACANT LOT.

The car skids to a stop and Rodriguez gets out of the driver's

side, slamming the door and storming off. He's out of his

mind.

Divinci gets out quickly, follows him. Rodriguez is so fired

up and scared he can't stop moving.

Divinci catches Rodriguez, tries to stop him from flailing

about.

Rodriguez tries to push Divinci away, but Divinci holds on.

They struggle --

-- pushing, shoving, falling to the dirt. Divinci jumps on

top of him, pulling his pistol and shoving it into Rodriguez

mouth.

Rodriguez glares up at Divinci.

It takes Rodriguez a moment, but he nods. Divinci pulls his

gun out of Rodriguez' mouth, gets off him and holsters his

pistol. Rodriguez is scared to death, not of Divinci, of the

mess they're in. He just lies in the dirt.

Rodriguez starts to get to his feet. Divinci grabs him, yanks

him up. Pushes him to the car.

They move back to the car. Rodriguez gets back into the

driver's seat. Divinci moves around to the passenger side.

Gets in, slams the door shut.

INT. UNMARKED CAR - DAY

They sit silently in the car for a moment in the middle of

the vacant lot. Breathing hard. Dirty. After a beat --

Rodriguez turns slowly and looks at Divinci incredulously.

Rodriguez stares at Divinci for a beat, then we --

EXT. UNMARKED CAR - PARKED - DAY

Rodriguez and Divinci are sitting on the car, each with a

beer and sharing a bottle of whiskey.

Rodriguez is calmer, but still something bothers him --

A moment of silence, then --

EXT. STREET - DAY

THREE AFRICAN AMERICAN YOUTHS, all in their twenties, are

hanging on a street corner. Talking. Normal street traffic.

They give a long hard look to an ATTRACTIVE AFRICAN AMERICAN

WOMAN who walks past. A little chatter.

The UNMARKED CAR suddenly screeches to the curb. The black

youths scatter quickly as Divinci jumps out and goes after

the tallest of the three. His name is JAMES. Rodriguez guns

the car and gives chase on wheels.

James darts across traffic. Divinci running hard after him.

Rodriguez spins the car in a u-turn. Racing after them.

EXT. ALLEY - SAME TIME

James darts down the alley. Narrow, dark, lined with trash

bins. Divinci turns into the alley, but he isn't going to

catch him.

James is almost to the end when the car turns into the alley,

skidding to a stop. Rodriguez jumps out, gun leveled at James.

No where for him to go. He slows down. Rodriguez moves in

from his front, Divinci runs up from behind. James is

disgusted.

INT. POLICE STATION - EVIDENCE STORAGE ROOM - DAY

Divinci removes the PACKAGE OF COCAINE and the .44 from the

shelf. CASE NUMBER C-549087.

THE .44 - INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

SLIDING across a table to James, who stops it with his right

hand. Divinci and Rodriguez are across from him.

He shoves the gun back. Divinci stops it with his arm, careful

not to touch it.

James quickly realizes what they've done. He lunges for the

gun, but Divinci picks it up quickly with a pencil through

the trigger guard. James glares at them with murderous intent.

A beat, then James smiles.

Rodriguez and Divinci are silent.

DOOR - INT. APARTMENT - DAY

KICKED IN on a grungy small apartment. Divinci and Rodriguez

burst in, guns drawn. Scaring the shit out of an HISPANIC

MAN (CORTEZ) and his half-naked GIRLFRIEND as they watch

television.

CUT BACK TO:

THE .44 - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

SLIDING across the table back to Rodriguez and Divinci. Cortez

sits across from them. Wearing white t-shirt, baggy pants.

Tattoos on his arms.

Just want they wanted to hear. No alibi.

Cortez stares at them for a moment, then --

Cortez smiles and pulls up his shirt, revealing a long scar

across his stomach.

MAN - EXT. ALLEY - DAY

SLAMMING INTO A WALL, hitting hard, falling back to the dirty

garbage covered alley. He's about twenty-seven, thin, blond

hair tied in a pony tail. He wears a flannel shirt, jeans,

boots. He doesn't want to fight. His name is DAVE.

He looks up at Divinci and Rodriguez moving toward him.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

Dave is behind the desk handling the .44 with no apparent

problem.

Divinci walks around, holds out his hand for the gun.

Dave spits on the gun, wipes off his prints with his shirt.

He drops the gun, clean of prints onto the table.

Divinci and Rodriguez stare at Dave. They are not happy.

MUG SHOTS - INT. HOMICIDE SQUAD ROOM - DAY

in plastic pages. A BINDER full of criminal portraits. Divinci

is going through one book. Rodriguez searches another.

Rodriguez suddenly slams his book shut.

Divinci looks at him. Rodriguez is angry, tense. Divinci

gives him a look telling him this is not the time and place

for a discussion on this topic.

Divinci leans toward Rodriguez.

The PHONE RINGS. Divinci picks it up.

INT. CAPT. HENDERSON'S OFFICE - DAY

Captain Henderson is sitting behind his desk. Divinci and

Rodriguez are in front of him. Rodriguez is trying to hide

his nervousness. Divinci is absolutely cool.

Divinci and Rodriguez are quiet for a beat, then --

Rodriguez and Divinci are quiet for a moment, then --

EXT. CEMETERY - GRAVE SITE - LATE AFTERNOON

MOURNERS gathered around the grave site. WIFE in tears. MOTHER

in tears. The men trying their best to hold up. Beyond the

family, DEA AGENTS. Simms among them. A show of support and

solidarity. A REVEREND delivering --

CAMERA FINDS Divinci and Rodriguez at the back. Rodriguez

looks nervous. Divinci notices. Their conversation is quiet.

Divinci sees Simms approaching from the side.

Rodriguez glances toward Simms as he walks up. The

conversation is quiet. Not wanting to disturb the ceremony.

Divinci glances at Rodriguez.

Divinci is pissed. He doesn't like Simms.

Simms stares at Rodriguez and Divinci for a moment, then he

returns his attention to the ceremony.

EXT. HOT DOG VENDOR STREET - DUSK

Rodriguez and Divinci walk down the street, hot dogs in hand,

returning to their car parked curbside.

Divinci looks at Rodriguez, then smiles.

STRIPPER - INT. STRIP JOINT - NIGHT

bumping and grinding her way through her performance. We

don't see her face yet. Just her body. G-string and skin

tight tank top. LOUD MUSIC. MEN in the audience appreciative.

The room is smoky. LIGHTS swirl over the stage. The tank top

comes off. WHISTLES and CHEERS. And now we see the dancer --

it's CYNTHIA.

INT. HALLWAY - BACK STAGE - NIGHT

Cynthia moves down the hall in her g-string and high heels.

She enters the dressing room.

INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Divinci is sitting in the only chair in the cramped little

room. He's going through her purse. Cynthia stops when she

sees him, then shuts the door.

INT. CYNTHIA'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Divinci and Cynthia are lying in bed. Divinci has his arm

around her, but he's staring at the ceiling.

Divinci looks at Cynthia.

Cynthia didn't really expect this from Divinci. She's

actually, despite herself, a little touched.

A beat, then --

Divinci leans in and they kiss.

EXT. CYNTHIA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Divinci exits the building. Starts to cross the street to

his car parked on the opposite side when he HEARS SOMETHING

BEHIND him. He turns, instantly reaching for his pistol.

A drunk staggers out of the alley -- looks like he has a gun

in his hand.

Divinci instinctively raises his gun to shoot when --

THE LIGHT -- catches the object in the drunk's hand -- a

BROWN BOTTLE, the neck sticking ahead like the barrel of a

gun.

The drunk stops when he hears the voice. Looks through his

matted greasy hair that cascades in front of his eyes. Now

we recognize Joe.

Divinci turns away, disgusted. Opens his car door, then stops.

Caught in a thought. He turns back and looks at Joe again.

EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

Joe stumbles back into the DARKNESS OF THE ALLEY. Lies down

next to a trash bin. LIGHTS suddenly illuminate Joe. Joe

squints as a CAR moves right up to him. Joe shields the light

with an arm.

We HEAR the DOOR OPEN and CLOSE, then Divinci bends down

into the LIGHT. He is wearing a BASEBALL CAP backwards on

his head. And GLOVES on his hands. He reaches inside Joe's

JACKET POCKET.

He pulls out the Smith and Wesson .44. Divinci looks at Joe.

Confused, Joe looks up at Divinci through matted hair.

INT. CAR - DRIVING - NIGHT (EARLY MORNING)

Divinci drives. Joe up front. In an alcoholic daze.

Joe looks at Divinci. Having trouble focusing.

Joe looks down at his hands -- he's holding the .44.

Joe just stares at the gun.

Joe puts the gun into his jacket pocket.

EXT. STREET - EARLY MORNING

The LOCATION of HUDD'S MURDER. The street is empty. Quiet.

Divinci stops his car next to where Hudd died.

INT. DIVINCI'S CAR - EARLY MORNING

Joe is asleep, leaning against the window. Divinci reaches

across and yanks him.

Joe's eyes open. Divinci forces his head to the window.

Joe tries to turn to Divinci, but Divinci holds his head.

Divinci slams his foot down on the accelerator and --

THE CAR

-- tears off down the street.

RODRIGUEZ - INT. BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

asleep. Alone in a double bed. The PHONE RINGS. Rodriguez

startles awake. Catches the phone on the second ring.

INTERCUT WITH DIVINCI - INT. MOTEL ROOM - EARLY MORNING

Divinci on the phone in the f.g. Joe is passed out on the

bed in the b.g. The room is dark.

Rodriguez sits up in bed.

JOE - INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

asleep on the bed.

Divinci slaps him. Joe's eyes open.

The room is still dark. Curtains drawn. We now see Rodriguez.

He's wearing a black sock cap and gloves. He hands Divinci

POLICE PHOTOGRAPHS of the car, the street, the victim -- the

murder scene. Divinci pulls Joe into a sitting position.

Joe stares at the photographs and starts to shake his head.

Joe is confused.

Joe looks at the bottle Rodriguez holds out to him.

Joe stares at the photographs for a moment, then nods.

Joe thinks a moment, then reaches into his coat pocket and

pulls out the .44. Divinci hands Joe the bottle and Joe

drinks. We PUSH IN on the BOTTLE OF VODKA as the liquid drains

away and we CLOSE IN TIGHT until we can SEE LIONEL HUDD'S

FACE as we --

CLOSE UP - THE PHOTOGRAPHS

Hudd dead. Blood on the windows. The street. Joe is drunk

again. In a haze. Starts to lift the bottle. Rodriguez pulls

it away. Rodriguez and Divinci always stay behind Joe.

Joe looks up as if trying to remember. Or trying not to.

Joe shakes his head.

Rodriguez suddenly smacks Joe on the side of the head when

he tries to look back. Joe is surprised by the blow. Divinci

pushes Rodriguez back. Shakes his head telling him to back

off.

Joe nods.

Divinci looks at Rodriguez. Rodriguez nods.

INT. CAR - NIGHT - LIONEL HUDD

driving. The night that he was shot. He looks ahead into the

darkness of the street. Suddenly he SEES --

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

A MAN standing in the street ahead of him.

HUDD - INT. CAR - NIGHT

smiles and turns toward the man in the street.

A .44

is pulled from a jacket pocket, lifted toward the APPROACHING

CAR. The gun is in the hands of Joe. He is scared. The

HEADLIGHTS COMING RIGHT AT HIM. He aims and FIRES the gun.

THE FRONT WINDOW

SHATTERS. And the car swerves to the curb.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Joe watches from the street, then looks at the .44 in his

hand.

BACK INSIDE THE MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Rodriguez leans into Joe who is now sitting on the edge of

the bed, looking down at the .44 in his hand.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Joe is in the street again. He doesn't know what he did.

BACK INSIDE THE MOTEL ROOM

Divinci leans close to Joe from behind now.

And now Joe can imagine it. We PUSH INTO JOE'S EYES.

BACK TO THE STREET

as Joe turns and runs. As fast as he can away from the death.

He looks back over his shoulder, scared.

BACK INSIDE THE MOTEL ROOM

Joe is staring at the gun. Divinci and Rodriguez watch him.

Rodriguez looks at Divinci.

JOE - BACK ON THE STREET - NIGHT

AIMS the gun again at the APPROACHING CAR.

And we HEAR the GUN SHOT AGAIN, shattering the silence as we --

THE SMOKING .44 - INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY

held by Joe's hand, which is held by Divinci's gloved hand.

Divinci has held Joe's finger on the trigger and pulled it.

The gunshot is deadened in the old building. Joe is lying in

the back seat of a car, passed out, with Divinci holding the

.44 in his hand. The back door is open. The engine is running.

Divinci pulls the 44. out of Joe's hand, then shuts the door,

gets into the front. The car pulls away, exiting the

warehouse.

HAND - INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - POLICE STATION - DAY

signing a name at the bottom of a paper -- Joe. Beneath it

is the type written name: JOE DOE. We PULL BACK and see it's

Joe signing a typewritten page as Divinci and Rodriguez watch.

Joe is a mess. When he finishes he pushes the paper away and

puts his head down on the table. Divinci picks up the paper

and we --

EXT. CYNTHIA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

A small yellow Toyota with a bashed up left fender pulls to

the curb. Cynthia gets out lugging her purse and a bag of

groceries. We HEAR ANOTHER CAR DOOR SHUT. She turns. Divinci

is walking across the street from his car toward her.

Divinci gives her a look as he takes the grocery bag from

her.

Divinci leads the way into the apartment building.

INT. CYNTHIA'S APARTMENT - DAY

Cynthia opens the door, pulls the key out of the lock as

Divinci enters behind her with the groceries.

She shuts the door. Divinci deposits the bag on the table.

Cynthia picks it up, moves into the kitchen.

Cynthia enters the kitchen and Divinci follows. Cynthia starts

unloading the groceries, putting the milk, eggs, etc. into

the refrigerator.

Cynthia turns suddenly.

Cynthia breathes a sigh of relief.

INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

Divinci and Rodriguez are moving down a hallway with Cynthia.

She's nervous. Wants very much not to be here.

INT. POLICE LINEUP ROOM - DAY

ROWS of seats face a small platform. The LINEUP WALL is

striped with horizontal lines with HEIGHT NUMBERS. The

brightly lighted lineup is separated from the gallery, which

is in the dark.

UNIFORMED GUARDS are on hand to make sure there is no

discussion, verbal or otherwise, between accused and witness.

SIX MEN file onto the platform. All shady characters.

The six men obey. A couple keep their heads down. The others

squint from the bright lights.

Heads are lifted. Eyes front. But we only recognize one of

them, standing third from the left. It's Joe.

Divinci, Rodriguez and Cynthia are in the gallery.

Cynthia counts three from the left and... wait a minute. She

looks more closely. Just to be sure. Rodriguez and Divinci

watch her. She's obviously putting on a good show. Then she

turns to Divinci, sitting next to her and whispers --

Divinci is caught a little of guard -- he didn't expect a

private conversation, nor does he want one for fear of it

looking like he's coaching her.

Cynthia, frustrated, gives Divinci a look.

Divinci still isn't sure what's gotten into her. Rodriguez

looks over, a little annoyed.

Divinci is losing his patience. He doesn't want to blow the

whole thing now, not in front of guards and police personnel.

The Guards are beginning to wonder what the hell's going on.

So are the MEN in the line.

Divinci leans in close to her. We can HEAR GRUMBLING from

the men on the platform.

Cynthia starts to protest again, but she suddenly feels

Divinci's hand grip her arm. He's had enough. Cynthia gets

the message. And while keeping her eyes locked on Divinci

she says --

JOE

squints against the harsh light, trying to see into the room,

as if he recognized the voice.

INT. HALLWAY - POLICE STATION - OUTSIDE THE LINEUP ROOM -

DAY

Rodriguez, Divinci and Cynthia move briskly down the hall.

None happy about what just happened. The conversation is

strained.

Rodriguez looks at Divinci. Is this a problem?

Divinci pulls a paper from his pocket.

Cynthia just stares at Rodriguez for a beat, then --

Rodriguez rolls his eyes.

Rodriguez grabs her arm and pushes her against the wall.

Divinci looks around quickly to see who's watching.

Rodriguez angrily throws up his hands and glares at Divinci.

Divinci gives him a look, then leans right up next to Cynthia.

Divinci holds out the paper. Cynthia hesitates a beat, then

takes it and signs her name.

JOE - CLOSE SHOT - MUG SHOTS

holding a number. The SCENE FADES WHITE with the FLASH.

CELL DOOR - INT. JAIL - DAY

closing on Joe who is standing in the small CELL, facing the

wall, his back to us. The door is locked and we --

INT. EVIDENCE ROOM - DAY

as the .44 is placed on a shelf. But this time it's tagged

with a different number. M5114000.

THE SIGNED CONFESSION - INT. CAPT. HENDERSON'S OFFICE - DAY

as Agent Simms reads through it to the end.

Simms looks across at Rodriguez and Divinci. Capt. Henderson

and TWO OTHER DEA AGENTS (HOOPER and SARKASIAN) are also

present. The DEA are in suits and ties.

Suddenly Simms slams his hand down on the desk.

Everyone turns to Simms. He's angry. Rodriguez is uneasy.

The intensity of Simms anger quiets everybody. A beat as

Simms regains his composure.

Simms crosses the room to Divinci and Rodriguez.

He shakes their hands. Then exits. Hooper and Sarkasian follow

their boss out the door. Rodriguez, Divinci and Henderson

exchange a look.

HEADLIGHTS (B&W)

coming right at us. Closer and closer. Filling the screen.

FLAMES BURST (COLOR)

from the barrel of a .44 in SLOW MOTION -- a FIREBALL. The

GUNSHOT is deafening, like thunder.

GLASS

SHATTERS in SLOW MOTION.

JOE

covers his face with his hands to protect himself from the

glass. But there is no glass. Joe is sweating, detoxing.

Wild eyed. He looks through his fingers, but there is no

street, no dead man. Just the BARS of his CELL.

GLASS OF WHISKEY - INT. CYNTHIA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

golden liquid caressing the ice. A hand lifts the glass to

red lips. The liquid disappears. Cynthia lowers the glass,

staring at it.

Cynthia suddenly hurls the glass across the room.

THE GLASS - SLOW MOTIONS

shatters against the wall. And bits of glass, edges sharp

tumble through space like ice.

INT. POLICE JAIL - CELLBLOCK HALLWAY - DAY

A GUARD leads a MAN in a dark suit and striped tie down the

corridor. He carries a briefcase. Short hair and a beard and

wire-rimmed glasses. His name is ELLIOT GOFF.

They stop at the cell block door. The guard unlocks the door.

INSIDE THE CELL we can see Joe on the floor in fetal position.

Shaking from lack of alcohol.

INT. INFIRMARY - DAY

Elliot waits in the hall. Fingers impatiently drumming his

briefcase. The door opens and a DOCTOR exits the room.

The doctor nods, opens the door. Elliot enters.

INT. INFIRMARY - DAY

Basic first aid station. Joe is on a table. Eyes closed.

Elliot walks up. Doctor behind him.

Joe's eyes open.

Joe's eyes close. Leaving Elliot in the dark.

INT. SMALL COURTROOM - DAY

Court is in session. Old metropolitan courthouse. The

PROSECUTOR and his TEAM are at one table. The DEFENSE ATTORNEY

and his CLIENT are at the other.

The Prosecutor is a woman. Her name is HELEN EDEN. She is

thirty-nine. She wears a business suit. RICHARD STEIN is her

second in command. Richard is thirty-three.

The DEFENSE ATTORNEY is fifty and a little on the portly

side. His name is JOHN OBLINGER.

But it's the DEFENDANT that really attracts our attention.

His name is CLYDE D. DUNNER. He's done his best to look like

a law abiding citizen, but no matter what kind of clothes he

wears or how he slicks down his long hair or trims his

mustache, this sonuvabitch looks like he'd kill for a nickel.

He's on trial for murder. In the first. What a surprise.

We are in the midst of opening statements. And Helen is

keeping the JURY riveted. The presiding Judge is a WOMAN,

JUDGE WEINBERG.

The defendant is hardly listening. His attention is on TWO

MEN SITTING BEHIND the prosecution table. And he turns to

glare at them. The two men are DETECTIVES RODRIGUEZ and

DIVINCI.

Clyde glares at them as if he'd like to get up right now,

walk over to them and cut off their heads. Actually, that's

what he's thinking. He mouths "You die."

Divinci mouths back. "Fuck you, prick, asshole, dickhead."

Then he smiles. Clyde boils.

John Oblinger, his attorney, catches Clyde's murderous look

and instructs him, with a point of his hand, to pay attention

to Helen. Clyde reluctantly turns his gaze from Divinci.

A YOUNG MAN, looking very upset, enters the courtroom, shows

i.d. to a GUARD, then makes his way down the aisle. He tries

his best to be quiet, not to interrupt Helen's statement.

Helen looks at the jury for a beat, then returns to her table.

John Oblinger stands to present his side of the case. But

our attention stays with Helen as she approaches the table

to find her team in an upset. Their conversation is a tense

whisper.

A pause in the court. The judge taps his gavel in anger as

we --

INT. HELEN'S OFFICE - DAY

Rodriguez, Divinci, Richard Stein, the young man and Helen.

Helen is furious.

Rodriguez and Divinci exchange a look.

RODRIGUEZ AND DIVINCI - EXT. COURTROOM - DAY

walking quickly down the steps.

BRIEFCASE - ALLEY - DAY

as it opens, revealing a DOZEN different HANDGUNS.

A BLACK MAN in a three piece suit, picks up the .44 with a

GLOVED HAND. His accent is British.

Rodriguez and Divinci look down at the gun.

The gun seller eyes them for a moment.

Divinci and Rodriguez stare at the gun seller. Then he smiles.

INT. EVIDENCE ROOM - DAY

as the NEW .44 goes onto the shelf. CASE NUMBER C-549087.

INT. JAIL - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

Elliot is waiting, sitting at a table, staring at papers in

his open briefcase. Door opens and a GUARD leads Joe into

the room. Joe looks better, for the first time. His hair is

combed. And he's clean. He wears jail blues. But he is a

little gaunt. And tired. Elliot stands. The guard shuts the

door, leaving them alone.

Joe just stares at Elliot.

Joe crosses to the table and takes a chair opposite Elliot.

Okay? Not the answer Elliot was looking for.

Elliot stares at Joe. This is going to be a little more

difficult than he thought.

Elliot hopes he can trigger a response. Joe tries hard.

Elliot stares at Joe, then looks down at the blank page in

front of him.

INT. SMALL COURTROOM - DAY

The trial of Clyde D. Dunner in progress. Prosecution team

at their table. Defense team at their table. JUDGE WEINBERG

at the bench. Divinci on the stand. Clyde glaring at him.

And Jury listening to Helen on the floor, prosecuting with

vigor.

Helen crosses to the prosecution table, picks up the .44.

She holds it up for the jury to see.

The .44 is duly entered into the records.

CLYDE

glances at "his" .44 as it passes into the BAILIFF'S HANDS.

It's a .44 all right.

STEVEN J. ALLEN, a short balding bespectacled man in his

fifties, crosses to the witness box where he is sworn in,

then sits.

Clyde's attention is on Helen's LEGS. He's bored by the

proceedings, but something suddenly strikes him. He looks at --

THE .44 SMITH AND WESSON

-- on the evidence table. There is no BLACK STAIN on the

handle.

All attention turns to Clyde. His attorney, the judge, the

jury, Helen, everybody is surprised by the sudden statement.

The Judge taps her gavel. John Oblinger puts a hand on Clyde's

arm. Clyde pulls it away. And now things happen very fast.

And Clyde is moving toward the gun. And the Bailiff and GUARDS

are moving toward Clyde. And Helen is moving out of the way.

And the Judge is standing, banging her gavel. And the jury

is scared.

Clyde grabs for the gun as the bailiff and guards grab for

Clyde. Clyde turns and decks the bailiff and all hell breaks

lose.

INT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY

Door slams open. Rodriguez and Divinci enter. Rodriguez

quickly checks all the stalls as Divinci closes the door.

They are alone. When Rodriguez finishes with the stalls --

INT. EVIDENCE ROOM - DAY

The harried Desk Officer is filling out his usual paper work

when Divinci and Rodriguez approach. Divinci knocks on the

door. The desk officer looks up. He's had a tough day.

INT. SMALL COURTROOM - DAY

Joe's preliminary trial. Joe is seated at the defense table

with Elliot. ANOTHER JUDGE, JUDGE HAROLD PINE, is behind the

bench. No jury. This is a preliminary hearing to determine

if there's enough evidence for Joe to stand trail. Elliot is

shuffling papers in preparation for his opening.

And at the prosecution table is a very tired Helen. She looks

completely pissed off and worn out. In no mood for anything

to go wrong.

Elliot stands.

Helen gives Elliot a look. She doesn't need this.

Elliot turns to Joe.

Helen and Elliot cross to the bench.

The judge hesitates, then looks at Joe. Joe is staring at

him.

Helen's look turns icy.

INT. ETHNIC BAR/RESTAURANT - DAY

Dark, smoky. Not a place for the health-conscious. Rodriguez

and Divinci at a corner booth. Both with scotch and waters.

Rodriguez is quiet.

Divinci lifts his glass in a toast to himself, drinks.

Rodriguez downs his scotch.

Rodriguez nods. A WAITRESS comes to the table. Rodriguez

orders another. The Waitress leaves. Rodriguez hesitates a

moment, then --

Divinci downs his scotch. Rodriguez nods, then --

Rodriguez smiles. Divinci looks at him for a beat, then --

NEWSPAPER - INT. CYNTHIA'S APARTMENT - DAY

with JOE'S PHOTOGRAPH on the front page. HEADLINE: UNDERCOVER

COP GUNNED DOWN BY UNDERCOVER KILLER. We PAN AROUND to

Cynthia, sitting in her kitchen, staring at the photograph.

INT. SMALL COURTROOM - DAY

The Dunner trial. The JURY is back. Helen, Judge Weinberg,

Clyde D. Dunner (who now sports a couple bandages to his

head), his attorney John Oblinger -- they're all waiting for

the verdict.

Clyde stands.

Helen closes her eyes in defeat. Clyde smiles.

INT. HOMICIDE DIVISION - DAY

Divinci is on the phone.

Rodriguez suddenly strides up. He looks panicked.

Divinci stares at Rodriguez for a beat, the reality of his

statement taking a moment to fully slam home.

INT. STRIP JOINT - NIGHT

Cynthia on stage, in the middle of her routine. Hoots and

whistles from the all MALE CROWD. But she's not really into

her performance tonight. She pulls off the last of her

clothing to APPLAUSE and CHEERS.

INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Cynthia enters. An ASIAN MAN in sweat shirt and jeans is

sitting in the room.

The Asian Man stands.

The man moves toward her, pulling a PAPER from his pocket.

He hands it to her.

He exits. No answer. Cynthia stares at the paper --

But the man is gone. BOB, a HUGE BOUNCER, tears past, giving

chase.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Dark, quiet. PHONE RINGS. A hand picks up the phone.

INTERCUT WITH SERGEANT - INT. HOMICIDE DIVISION - NIGHT

The station is alive with activity. Even at this early hour.

HOOKERS, PIMPS, PUSHERS, DRUNK DRIVERS. Some being booked,

some being released, some being obnoxious.

Divinci turns on the light revealing a WOMAN in bed with

him. He picks up his watch, looks at the time.

Divinci perks up at the name.

And now we SEE Cynthia in the POLICE STATION trying not to

look as freaked out as she feels. But she's not holding

together well.

Divinci hangs up. Starts to dress. The woman groans.

She pulls the covers over her head. Divinci pulls on his

pants.

INT. POLICE STATION - 3:38 A.M.

Divinci pushes into the room. Sees Cynthia sitting on the

bench, looking nervous as hell. Smoking, tapping her foot,

looking around. Just this side of a wreck.

Cynthia sees him and is immediately on her feet, moving to

him.

He takes her arm, leads her out of the station.

INT. POLICE STATION PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

Divinci leads Cynthia out of the station to his car.

He opens the driver's door, pushes her in. Gets in behind

her.

INT. UNMARKED CAR - NIGHT

Cynthia is a bundle of nerves. Divinci slams the door. Cynthia

is startled by the suddenness of his anger.

Cynthia opens her purse and pulls out the subpoena.

Divinci glances at the papers.

This is yet another glitch that Divinci hadn't counted on.

Cynthia glares at him, then turns away, takes a drag and

blows out the smoke.

Divinci hesitates as ANOTHER CAR pulls out. Then turns to

her.

Cynthia looks at Divinci, unsure. Divinci gives her a

confident smile. Look, it's another stage, that's all. Just

like dancin'.

THE UNMARKED CAR

pulls quickly out of the PARKING GARAGE.

INT. JAIL - MEETING ROOM - DAY

Elliot is waiting. The guard opens the door and Joe enters.

Joe is looking better. Getting him off booze has helped

immensely.

Elliot nods, motions for Joe to take a chair.

Elliot stares at Joe for a beat, then we --

YELLOW CRIME SCENE TAPE - EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

TWO MURDER VICTIMS lying in the street. POLICE OFFICERS have

the area under control. A few CURIOUS PEOPLE have stopped to

watch. An UNMARKED CAR pulls up. Stops.

INT. UNMARKED CAR - DAY

Parked. Rodriguez behind the wheel. Divinci next to him.

An OFFICER walks to the car and knocks on the window. Divinci

rolls it down.

Divinci rolls the window back up. The officer backs off.

Divinci looks at Rodriguez.

Rodriguez is silent. Divinci opens the door. Rodriguez watches

him, then he follows. To the scene of another crime.

INT. CYNTHIA'S APARTMENT - DAY

Cynthia is in the kitchen, making herself a peanut butter

and jelly sandwich as she watches Sally Jesse Raphael

interview yet another moron on television. The phone rings.

She takes a bite of the sandwich as she picks up and mumbles --

INTERCUT WITH INT. OFFICE - D.A.'S DEPARTMENT - DAY

Richard Stein, the attorney, is on the phone. His office is

cluttered with the myriad of case files he's forced to juggle.

Cynthia puts down the sandwich, her appetite suddenly gone.

SUITCASE - INT. CYNTHIA'S BEDROOM - DAY

as clothes are stuffed into it. The suitcase is slammed shut.

And Cynthia heads for the door.

EXT. MANSION - DAY

A BLACK CONVERTIBLE MERCEDES pulls into the circular, gated

drive of the large two story home on immense manicured

grounds. A BMW is parked in front of the FOUR CAR GARAGE. It

and a MAN gets out. He has gray hair and expensive clothes.

He carries a briefcase and heads for the front door. His

name is ARTHUR BAYLOR.

EXT. MANSION - PATIO - DAY

A BUTLER shows Arthur to the patio where another MAN, NATHAN

MCCALL, is seated behind a table, reviewing documents. McCall

is fifty-five, wears glasses.

McCall looks up, smiles.

Arthur removes a NEWSPAPER from his briefcase. Opens it.

Revealing the PHOTOGRAPH OF JOE and the headline: UNDERCOVER

COP GUNNED DOWN BY UNDERCOVER KILLER. McCall looks at the

paper.

Arthur points at the photograph. McCall looks. A beat, then --

INT. BUS STATION - DAY

Cynthia boards a greyhound. Getting the hell out of Dodge.

INT. CYNTHIA'S APARTMENT - DAY

We HEAR a key in the lock. The door opens and Divinci enters.

He looks around.

He moves into the bedroom. Sees clothes strewn around and a

half empty closet.

He heads back into the living room. Pulls open the door and

almost runs into Richard Stein who was just about to knock.

Richard Stein is just as startled and it takes him a moment

to recognize --

Divinci is caught off guard.

Divinci looks at Stein for a beat, then smiles and --

Divinci heads down the walkway. Richard Stein watches him

for a moment, then looks at the closed door, then at his

watch.

INT. ELLIOT'S OFFICE - DAY

Elliot's office is a cramped space in the PUBLIC DEFENDERS

FLOOR of the CRIMINAL COURTS BUILDING. A buzz of activity

outside. The staff is overworked, underpaid and

underappreciated. Elliot is reviewing legal documents. Knock

on the door.

The door opens and Arthur Baylor enters.

Elliot looks up and suddenly recognizes --

Elliot is stunned and flattered. He stands quickly.

Arthur shuts the door.

INT. JAIL - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

Door opens. Joe is lead into the room by the JAIL GUARD. Joe

looks even better now. His stay in jail has broken his

dependency on alcohol. His hair is clean and combed. And

he's not as depressed. He stops upon seeing Elliot and Arthur

at the table. Both men stand. The guard shuts the door. Arthur

looks at Joe for a moment, then says --

Joe stares at Arthur as if fighting a lost memory, then --

INT. DISTRICT ATTORNEY - HELEN'S OFFICE - DAY

Richard Stein is facing a not very happy Helen. She is seated

behind her desk stacked high with case files.

Richard Stein nods quickly.

And he exits fast. He doesn't like it when his boss is pissed.

And right now his boss is really pissed.

EXT. BAIL BOND OFFICE - DAY

A seedy side street near the courthouse and jail. The unmarked

car pulls up and Divinci gets out.

INT. BAIL BOND OFFICE - DAY

The interior is sparse. Several FRAMED FIGHT POSTERS on the

walls. All with MANNY LADREW, a young tough fighter in the

featherweight division, in his best pose, explaining where

and when the next bout will be -- but all these posters are

at least fifteen years old.

Two desks. One for the secretary, who is on vacation, and

the other for MANNY LADREW, the ex-pugilist. He's put on

some pounds in the intervening years, plus an added thin

mustache. Manny is on the phone --

Divinci enters.

Manny glares at Divinci. He doesn't like Divinci, never has,

never will. But he's a cop. Cop's you have to make room for.

Divinci pulls some papers out of his pocket, hands them to

Manny.

Manny, annoyed, looks at the papers -- photo of Cynthia

included.

Divinci glares at Manny, then exits. Manny watches him leave.

INT. LARGE COURTROOM - DAY

Joe (William) is lead into the courtroom by GUARDS. Takes

his place at the DEFENSE TABLE which includes Elliot and TWO

YOUNG ATTORNEYS. The PROSECUTION TABLE, which includes Richard

Stein and Helen is going over last minute minutia.

PEOPLE are taking seats in the gallery. But another attorney

joins the Defense table. It's Arthur Baylor. And Richard

Stein double-takes when he sees him.

AT THE PROSECUTION TABLE

Helen turns.

They watch Arthur shake hands with everyone - Elliot, the

two young attorneys and Joe.

Arthur takes a seat at the defense table and glances across

at Helen and Richard and nods. Helen and Richard are stunned.

Everyone rises as JUDGE HAROLD PINE enters. In black robe.

Taking his place behind the bench. He sits.

Everyone sits. And even Judge Harold Pine double-takes when

he sees Arthur Baylor at the Defense table.

Arthur stands.

Everyone turns to look at Joe (William McCall). CAMERA PUSHES

in on him. It doesn't look as if he's sure who he is yet.

Judge Harold Pine taps his gavel.

TELEVISION NEWS REPORTS - INT. HELEN'S OFFICE - DAY

FLASH Joe's photograph and scenes of him being lead from the

courtroom. Helen and Richard Stein are watching. They can't

believe it.

INT. UNMARKED CAR - DAY

Parked on the street. Rodriguez and Divinci inside. Rodriguez

reads the paper.

Rodriguez slams down the paper.

Divinci grabs the paper away from him. Both cops are angry,

upset, frustrated and scared to death.

Divinci closes the paper.

Divinci looks at Rodriguez.

Both men are quiet for a moment, then --

INT. BALL BOND OFFICE - DAY (LATE AFTERNOON)

Manny LaDrew is pouring himself a cup of coffee. His SECRETARY

is typing up a letter at her desk.

Manny recognizes the voice. He mouths an oh fuck to himself,

then turns around to Divinci who is standing in the doorway.

Divinci suddenly explodes, going for Manny, grabbing him,

slamming him against the wall, his arm to Manny's throat.

Divinci glares at Manny for a beat, then he storms out.

Manny looks down at his Secretary.

DIVINCI - INT. HOMICIDE DIVISION - DUSK

at his desk, on the phone.

Divinci slams down the phone. He sits quietly for a moment,

then rubs his face. Rodriguez crosses to his desk, sits down.

MANNY - INT. BALL BONDS OFFICE - NIGHT

getting the shit beat out of him. The room is dark. Two men

are hammering on Manny. Throwing him against the wall, pulling

him up and hitting him in the stomach -- not the face.

Throwing him across the room, over the desk. Manny is too

hurt to get up. Divinci walks over to him, rubbing his gloved

hand.

Manny looks up weakly. Divinci walks away. Rodriguez opens

the door and they exit.

INT. COUNTY JAIL CELL - MORNING

Joe is sitting on his cot, staring at the floor. ANOTHER MAN

is in the cell with him, reading a magazine. His name is

DUNCAN. Duncan looks at Joe.

We HEAR the BARRED CELL DOOR open.

Joe gets up. Puts out his hands. They shackle him as we HEAR --

INT. COUNTY JAIL CELL - HALLWAY - MORNING

Joe is lead down the hall by TWO GUARDS, past rows of cells

filled with other PRISONERS --

They so enter it.

RODRIGUEZ - INT. LARGE COURTROOM - LATER

the paper.

A waitress cruises past tables to the booth in the back. She

sets down two scotch and waters to the two men. Rodriguez

Rodriguez nods.

INT. HELEN'S D.A. OFFICE - NIGHT

Chinese.

The phone rings. Richard picks up.

Richard is surprised. He turns to Helen.

Richard hangs up the receiver. He and Helen exchange a look.

INT. LARGE COURTROOM - DAY

VARIOUS REACTIONS

Rodriguez and Divinci are stunned. Cynthia? Elliot is

completely surprised. Cynthia? Arthur is never shaken by

anything.

The courtroom doors open and Cynthia is lead down the aisle

by a SHERIFF'S DEPUTY. She moves to the chair.

But it's Joe's turn to double take. He remembers her. My

God, he knows her. It's Cynthia -- the girl from the apartment

building. He never saw who pointed him out, but he never

expected it to be her.

Cynthia raises her hand. But her look goes right to Joe.

Staring at him. She's never seen Joe like this -- cleaned

up, trimmed, handsome. She's not sure she even recognizes

him.

She turns her eyes from Joe.

Cynthia sits down. Looks at Divinci.

And Joe leans across to Arthur and Elliot. Their conversation

is in whispers --

Arthur exchanges a look with Elliot. Arthur turns now and

looks at Cynthia. The wheels are turning.

Cynthia looks at Joe. Joe looks straight at her. Cynthia

turns her eyes away.

EXT. STREET - MINI MART - NIGHT

Cynthia comes out of a ALL NIGHT MINI-MART with a bag of

food. She walks down the street and suddenly we HEAR a

GUNSHOT. Followed by a CAR CRASH. She turns toward the sound.

And we HEAR RUNNING FOOTSTEPS. Then we see a man running. He

has a pistol in one hand.

Cynthia watches the man run past and disappear into the

darkness.

INT. LARGE COURTROOM - DAY

Cynthia is looking at Helen.

Instead of looking at Joe, Cynthia turns to Rodriguez and

Divinci who are seated in the rows behind the prosecution

table. They are looking right at her. They wait for her

answer.

Divinci offers her a small smile.

Cynthia turns away. Arthur is now standing in front of her.

Divinci stares at Cynthia. As if willing her to give the

answer he wants her to give.

Arthur pauses.

Cynthia realizes what she's said.

Arthur turns dramatically to Cynthia. She is scared.

Everyone's attention is on Cynthia.

Cynthia looks from Arthur to Divinci. Divinci is frozen.

Rodriguez is sweating.

Then Cynthia turns and looks at Joe.

Joe looks at her, feeling sorry for her. Not hating her.

Cynthia lowers her eyes to the floor.

Helen and Richard Stein are stunned yet again.

Divinci and Rodriguez are doing their best to remain cool,

calm and collected.

Cynthia looks up at the judge. She's not talking.

Divinci exits.

INT. COUNTY JAIL CELL - NIGHT

A beat, then he lowers his gun.

Divinci holsters his gun. Rodriguez hesitates, breathes a

sigh, then returns to the car. They both get back in.

INT. UNMARKED CAR - NIGHT

Divinci starts up the car.

Divinci starts to shift gears, but suddenly throws his elbow

into Rodriguez' face. And Divinci is all over him like a

tornado. Slamming a fist into his face repeatedly. He grabs

his shirt and rips it open REVEALING the TAPE RECORDER

strapped to his body, recording their every word.

Divinci puts his revolver to Rodriguez' head. Rodriguez,

bleeding from the mouth and nose, looks at Frank.

Divinci pulls back the hammer, ready to blow Rodriguez' head

off.

Divinci is ready to pull the trigger.

Divinci rips the wires off the recorder. Rodriguez closes

his eyes, waiting for the end. A tense moment, then --

Rodriguez opens his eyes, looking at Divinci, who is still

holding the gun to his head. Another moment, then --

A beat, then Rodriguez gets out. Divinci looks up at his

partner.

EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

The car tears away, leaving Rodriguez alone in the alley.

THE KEY - INSERTED INTO THE DOOR LOCK - NIGHT

Rodriguez pushes open the door to his apartment, enters.

Shuts the door. Stands alone in the room for a moment, then

suddenly erupts in rage. Ripping off his coat, ripping off

his shirt, ripping off the tape recorder taped to his chest.

He throws the recorder on the ground. Stomps on it until

it's shattered into pieces. He stares at the broken recorder.

Rodriguez spins around. Vic steps into the moonlight streaming

in through the window. Behind him is Cutless Supreme.

Rodriguez suddenly YELLS and CHARGES THEM. He tackles Vic.

But in the darkness we can't see anything. Until the explosion

of a GUN and the FLASH of flames lights up the room. A moment

of silence then --

Two men stumble to the door. Leaving one on the floor. The

door is flung open and Vic runs out. Followed by Cutless

Supreme.

we SEE are GUNS in hands.

Cynthia and Manny wake up with a start. Manny is scared.

A BADGE comes out. And now we see Agents Hooper and Sarkasian.

Cynthia enters the office. The Guard shuts the door. Cynthia

finds herself facing Arthur Baylor. A tape recorder on the

table in front of him.

Arthur pushes the tape recorder and we HEAR --

Arthur watches Cynthia's reaction to "when she's dead." But

Cynthia has seen enough not to be too shocked by anything.

And her reaction is subtle. She knows better than to reveal

what she's really feeling and thinking.

The recording ends. Arthur shuts off the machine.

Cynthia hesitates, then shakes her head.

A beat, then Cynthia pulls up a chair.

Giant party in progress. Expensive cars parked along the

INT. MCCALL MANSION - DUSK

Filled with well-wishers in TUXES and GOWNS. Arthur Bailor

of the PRETTY YOUNG WOMEN.

CAMERA MOVES to Arthur, who is also receiving his share of

the credit.

And CAMERA CONTINUES TO Joe and Nathan.

Joe just takes it all in, smiling and nodding.

A beat, then Joe smiles.

A BLACK TUXEDO WIPES past CAMERA as we --

Door opens. Cynthia enters. Shuts the door. Tries the light.

It doesn't go on. Suddenly a man is next to her --

Cynthia tries to move, but a hand grabs her arm. And now we

see Divinci. He looks like hell. A man on the run. Desperate

and dangerous. He hasn't shaved. His clothes are filthy. He

looks like... Joe. Cynthia looks up at him.

Divinci suddenly shoves her hard across the room.

Divinci pushes her into the bedroom.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT (EARLY MORNING)

Cynthia goes to her closet, pulls out a box, opens it. It's

got her savings.

Divinci grabs the money and stuffs it into his jacket pocket.

Divinci puts aside his gun. And pushes Cynthia down on the

bed. He leans in close to her. Face to face.

Divinci looks at Cynthia for a moment, almost with remorse.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (EARLY MORNING)

It is dark and quiet. No clue as to what's going on inside.

And we hold on this for a long moment. Just wondering what's

she being made to do. And then there's a MUFFLED BOOM. Divinci

exits the bedroom quickly. He is upset. We HEAR the DOOR

close.

AND WHITE FEATHERS

fall like snow flakes on Cynthia's body draped across the

bed. The pillow on the floor beside her with the stuffing

blown out. She has a hole in her chest, right above her heart.

INT. BAIL BOND OFFICE - EARLY MORNING

Manny unlocks the door, enters his office.

Manny looks toward the voice. Divinci is sitting on the floor

out of sight. Holding his revolver.

Manny locks the door.

EXT. HOSPITAL - EARLY MORNING

An AMBULANCE races up to the EMERGENCY entrance.

INT. HOSPITAL - EARLY MORNING

TWO PARAMEDICS push the gurney down the hall. Cynthia is

conscious on the gurney. Looking up at the ceiling. She is

fading. We HEAR --

CYNTHIA'S (MOVING) P.O.V OF THE CEILING and FACES.

The gurney pushes past and CAMERA PICKS UP TWO SURGEONS moving

out of an Operating Room. Pulling off masks and rubber gloves

bloody from surgery. One of them is Joe. The other surgeon

pats him on the back.

Joe finally breathes a sigh of relief and manages a smile.

BLACK LINCOLN - EXT. BAIL BOND OFFICE - NIGHT

pulls up in front of the office. Tinted windows.

INT. BAIL BOND OFFICE - NIGHT

Manny is looking out the window.

Divinci looks out. Gun in hand. He's cleaned himself up.

He's now wearing a Hawaiian shirt, slacks. A traveler.

EXT. BAIL BOND OFFICE - NIGHT

The Lincoln idles at the curb. Divinci and Manny exit the

office. Divinci glances up and down the street as they move

toward the car. Manny opens the back door. Nobody inside.

Divinci hands Manny a wad of cash from his pocket, then gets

into the back of the car.

He closes the door. The Lincoln pulls away. Manny watches it

move off down the street.

INT. LINCOLN - NIGHT

Driving. Divinci in the back. Can only see the DRIVER'S EYES

in the REAR VIEW MIRROR.

Divinci settles into the leather seat. Looks at the rear

view mirror.

Suddenly the driver turns around, holding a 9mm and fires.

BLAM. BLAM. BLAM. Divinci's head snaps back as the BACK WINDOW

BLOWS OUT of the Lincoln.

And now we recognize the driver. It's Clyle D. Dunner.

THE LINCOLN

moves right into CAMERA. BRIGHT HEADLIGHTS filling the screen.

The car stops. We HEAR the DOOR OPEN and RUNNING FEET. And

PAN INTO THE BRIGHT HEADLIGHTS GLARING into CAMERA.

SURGICAL LIGHTS - INT. OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT

SHINING BRIGHTLY into CAMERA.

Faces appear. Looking down. We recognize Joe and one of the

friends from the party -- Sinclair.

Faces move away as we HEAR MEDICAL MACHINES in operation. A

NURSE reappears. CAMERA MOVES back now, revealing the room.

And the operation in progress.

Joe looks at the nurse.

CAMERA PUSHES IN ON JOE

The BRIGHT LIGHTS OVERHEAD bleed the scene to WHITE and we --

WAVES - DAY

crashing on white sand. PANNING with the clear blue water

racing up the sand to a woman in a bathing suit, sitting

alone. We PAN UP HER LEGS, past her stomach, to her CHEST

where we see a SCAR ABOVE HER HEART.

We CONTINUE UP TO HER FACE NOW. It's Cynthia. Staring out at

the ocean. Palm trees behind her. She's beautiful. She leans

back, hands behind her and... She smiles. Her life has

changed. And we HEAR HAWAIIAN SLACK KEY GUITAR MUSIC as we --
