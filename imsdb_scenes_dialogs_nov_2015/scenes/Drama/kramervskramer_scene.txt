INT. OFFICE  ADVERTISING AGENCY  MIDTOWN  EVENING

WIDE SHOT

A large and very comfortable office over-looking St. Patrick's

Cathedral. At the moment the office is filled to bursting

with men and women, slumped in chairs, sitting on desks, all

of them very tense. Among the crowd of people we note: MURRAY

FISHER, a young and very ambitious junior executive and

PHYLLIS BERNARD, an attractive woman in her early thirties.

She is a lawyer with the agency.

At the moment, TED KRAMER, nice-looking without being what

you would call a matinee idol, paces back and forth. His tie

is loosened, he checks his watch every fifteen seconds.

Clearly he is very distraught.

REVERSE ON JIM O'CONNOR

Ted's boss and good friend. He is in his middle fifties,

nattily dressed with the slightly bleary look of a heavy

drinker. He sits back in his chair with his feet propped on

the desk and a drink in one hand.

Sound-effect: The phone rings. Everyone freezes. As O'Connor

reaches for the phone,

INT. CHILD'S ROOM, KRAMER APT.  EVENING

The room is dark, the only light coming from a small night

light.

We SEE a beautiful five year old boy (BILLY KRAMER). He lies

in bed, half asleep. HOLD FOR A BEAT as a beautiful woman

(JOANNA KRAMER) leans over, kisses the child and hugs him

tightly to her.

ON JOANNA

She gets up from the bed and starts toward the door of the

child's room.

Joanna stops in the doorway, silhouetted against the light.

She turns, takes a last look at her son, then steps outside.

INT. HALLWAY  EVENING

ON JOANNA

Now that the light is brighter, we can SEE her more clearly.

In her mid-thirties, she is beautiful, dressed in a style

that can best be described as Bloomingdale's. HOLD FOR A

BEAT as she leans against the door. It is clear from her

expression that she is terribly upset. Then, making up her

mind, she crosses to a closet and takes out a suitcase.

THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH HER as she carries it into the bedroom,

lays it out on the bed and opens it.

PAN WITH HER as she crosses to a closet, grabs an armload of

clothes and dumps them helter-skelter into the suitcase.

INT. O'CONNOR'S OFFICE  EVENING

It is a few minutes later, the news has obviously been good

because there is a general celebration in progress.

Jim O'Connor, now standing, raises one hand for silence,

then making a toast.

Cheers and good-natured jokes.

More hoots and cheers. People start to yell "Speech."

INT. BATHROOM  KRAMER APT.  EVENING

Joanna stands at the medicine cabinet, going through it,

packing things in a travel kit: rollers, deodorant, makeup,

birth control pills. She starts to take a small bottle of

perfume that has only an eighth of an inch of fluid left

inside, hesitates, then puts it back.

INT. O'CONNOR'S OFFICE  EVENING

Now some time has passed, most of the crowd has gone and

only the regulars are left.

Murray Fisher leans over, shakes Ted's hand.

INT. KITCHEN  KRAMER APT.  EVENING

INSERT: A long and meticulous list that Joanna is making out

of the phone numbers and addresses of doctors and hospitals,

of what the various medicines are for, and of the foods that

Billy is and isn't permitted to eat.

WIDER ANGLE

As Joanna puts the finishing touches on the list and carefully

arranges it on top of the kitchen counter next to a box of

unsweetened, whole grain cereal and a jar of honey.

Note: It is this same set of notes that Ted will later

unthinkingly throw away.

EXT. OFFICE BUILDING  MIDTOWN  NIGHT

WIDE SHOT

As the doors to the outer lobby open and Ted and O'Connor

appear.

Ted starts to hail a cab, O'Connor stops him.

He turns and starts to walk off down the street, Ted, of

course, follows.

INT. BEDROOM  KRAMER APT.  NIGHT

CLOSE ON JOANNA

As she goes through her jewelry case, taking some things,

leaving others. In the B.G. we SEE a framed photograph of

Billy, smiling, looking into the camera.

EXT. STREET  NIGHT

ON TED AND O'CONNOR

Tracking with them as they walk.

INT. BEDROOM  KRAMER APT.  NIGHT

WIDE SHOT

The suitcase is now full. Joanna zips it shut and looks around

to make sure that she hasn't forgotten anything.

Then, she hefts her suitcase and starts out of the room.

INT. FOYER  NIGHT

WIDE SHOT

Joanna carries in the suitcase, sets it by the front door,

then she crosses to the living room and sits down at the

dining table.

CLOSER IN ON HER

She takes out a list made on the back of an old envelope. As

she begins to review it, checking off some items:

OFF SCREEN Sound: A key turning in the lock.

As Joanna looks up...

HER POV

As the door swings open to reveal Ted Kramer, an enormous

grin on his face, a bottle of champagne in his hand. He is

so full of himself that he doesn't notice there is anything

wrong.

Note: Throughout the entire scene he carries the bottle of

champagne, never putting it down.

CROSS-CUTTING BETWEEN THEM:

Joanna opens her purse, takes out her keys and wallet.

Note: Ted does not for a moment believe that his wife will

really leave him. All he can think of right now is that he

will have to spend the rest of the evening coping with one

of her moods.

CROSS-CUTTING BETWEEN THEM:

Joanna doesn't even bother to look up at him. She opens her

purse, takes out her wallet and begins removing credit cards.

She checks off the last item on her list as her husband

watches, dumbfounded.

Joanna gets to her feet and starts toward the front door. In

an instant Ted is after her.

ON JOANNA

At the door.

Joanna opens the door and they step out into the hallway.

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE KRAMER APT.  EVENING

Sound-effect: The elevator approaching.

CROSS-CUTTING BETWEEN THEM:

There is nothing more that can be done, this is the last

moment of intimacy.

The elevator door opens, Joanna steps inside.

Joanna shakes her head. The elevator door closes behind her

and it starts to descend.

ON TED KRAMER

He stands for a moment, stunned, unable to move. Then he

turns and races back into the apartment.

THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH HIM as he rushes across to one of the

living room windows, throws it open and leans out.

HIS POV

Looking down to the street from the eighth floor. We SEE

Joanna step off the curb and hail a passing taxi.

Either she doesn't hear him or else she pays no attention.

She gets into the cab, closes the door behind her and it

drives away.

INT. APT.  NIGHT

ON TED

As he stands for a moment watching the taxi as it disappears.

Then, slowly, he closes the window, turns, and AS THE CAMERA

TRACKS WITH HIM, walks into the bedroom.

The bedroom is a mess: the closet door stands open, inside

Joanna's section is empty except for some shoe-boxes and a

few dresses that are scattered across the floor. Several

dresser drawers have been pulled out and their contents

emptied.

HOLD IN A WIDE SHOT as Ted wearily picks up one of the dresses

and hangs it back on its hanger in its proper place, ready

for Joanna's return. As he continues straightening up the

room,

THE CAMERA SLOWLY FADES TO BLACK.

FADE IN:

INT. LIVING ROOM  VERY LATE AT NIGHT

WIDE SHOT

Ted Kramer paces back and forth, eyeing the phone. Then,

coming to a decision, he crosses to it, picks up the receiver

and starts to dial.

EXT. APT. BLDG.  LATE AT NIGHT

WIDE SHOT

The building is dark except for the Kramer apartment which

is ablaze with lights. HOLD as we HEAR:

Sound: The phone ringing. Then:

Sound-effect, as Ted slams down the receiver.

Instantly a light is turned on two floors below.

INT. FOYER  KRAMER APT.  NIGHT

ON THE FRONT DOOR

As we HEAR:

Sound-effect: the doorbell rings.

A moment later Ted opens the door and THELMA PHILLIPS enters.

She is a neighbor (Apt. 6-B) and Joanna Kramer's best friend.

About four months ago Thelma and her husband Charley were

divorced.

Until then the two families had been very close, the Kramer's

son

(Billy) being about the same age as the Phillips' daughter

(Kim).

With the divorce, however, the Kramers tried to remain friends

with both Thelma and Charley and that has caused a certain

amount of friction.

Thelma is an attractive woman in her mid-thirties. She dresses

well, works out religiously at Jack LaLanne's and goes to a

therapist twice a week. She is also given to acting the lay

analyst with her friends. Thelma is generous with her advice,

sharing the wealth so to speak. With all of this she is kind,

loyal and a loving friend. At the moment, however, she is

all business.

ON TED

From his attitude it is clear that there is no love lost

between them.

Ted draws himself upright with the dignity of the Ambassador

to the Court of St. James. However, during the following, he

begins pounding the pillows on the couch into shape with

real vehemence.

Thelma nods.

She turns and starts toward the front door, Ted at her heel.

CLOSE ON THELMA

That stops her dead in her tracks. She had always assumed

that Joanna took Billy with her when she left.

Ted shakes his head. There is a long beat of silence.

FADE IN:

EXT. KRAMER APT. BLDG.  EARLY MORNING

WIDE SHOT

It is a beautiful sunny morning and the super stands in front

of the building hosing down the sidewalk. HOLD as a garbage

truck enters FRAME and the garbage men begin loading sacks

of trash into the back of the truck. As it begins to grind

up the garbage with an ungodly sound, THE CAMERA PANS UP TO

THE EIGHTH FLOOR WINDOWS.

INT. BILLY KRAMER'S BEDROOM  EARLY MORNING

MEDIUM SHOT

Billy Kramer lies in his bed, fast asleep.

HOLD FOR A BEAT as we HEAR:

OFF SCREEN Sound: From the street below, the garbage truck

grinding up garbage.

A moment later, Billy opens his eyes, struggles to his feet

and,

AS THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH HIM, trudges sleepily out of his

room, across the hall and into the bathroom.

INT. BATHROOM  EARLY MORNING

As the child stands in front of the toilet, eyes closed, we

HEAR:

OFF SCREEN Sound-effect: as the child pees noisily.

Then, when he is finished, he turns and, without bothering

to flush the toilet, shuffles down the hall and into his

parents' bedroom.

HIS POV

The bed is empty, there is no sign that anyone has slept in

it.

ON BILLY

A look of suspicion on his face, he turns and starts back

down the hall toward the living room.

INT. LIVING ROOM  EARLY MORNING

As Billy enters, looks around.

HIS POV

Ted Kramer, still fully dressed, looking like the wrath of

God is asleep in the chair.

ON BILLY

As he marches across to his father.

ON TED

His eyes open, he looks around startled.

CROSS-CUTTING BETWEEN THEM:

Billy nods.

Ted struggles to his feet and THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH THEM as

they start toward the kitchen.

By now they are inside the kitchen, Ted looks around.

HIS POV

There, on the kitchen cabinet is a box of "natural grain"

cereal, a jar of honey, some wheat germ, and a banana, with

carefully written instructions from Joanna underneath.

ON TED

He takes one look at the note, crumples it up and tosses it

in the wastebasket.

Billy nods. Ted opens the refrigerator and takes some eggs.

As Ted begins the process of making French toast, it soon

becomes obvious that he has no idea of what he is doing.

What follows is a symphony in incompetence on Ted's part. He

breaks the eggs into a bowl and ends up with most of the

shell mixed up with the egg.

Then he takes a piece of bread and drops it into bowl.

ON BILLY

Watching all of this with increasing apprehension.

Ted takes a container of milk, pours it into the bowl so

that it is filled to the brim. Then he sloshes the bread

around until it is half-dissolved.

He lops off a huge hunk of butter, drops it into an omelet

pan and turns up the flame.

ON BILLY

Watching. He looks as though he is about to throw up.

He opens the refrigerator and starts to get the orange juice.

As he does, black smoke begins to billow ominously from the

frying pan.

Ted turns, spots the smoke.

He lunges for the handle of the frying pan, which by now is

very hot. He grabs it, lets out a howl of pain and the whole

mess, frying pan, butter, bread, goes crashing to the floor.

CLOSE ON TED

Suddenly all the rage comes pouring out.

REACTION  BILLY

Terrified.

WIDE SHOT

As Ted kneels down and begins to clean up the mess.

Everything's going to be all right.

EXT. STREET  DAY

ON A BUS

As it pulls to a stop. The doors open and a stream of mothers

and children get off. Among them we spot Ted Kramer with

Billy. As they start across the street, Ted reaches down and

takes hold of Billy's hand. The moment they get to the far

side, Billy takes his hand away from Ted's and wipes it on

his pants. Clearly Ted's hands are very sweaty.

CLOSER IN ON THEM

As they start down the block toward Billy's school.

CLOSER IN ON THEM

They walk in silence for a few steps, then:

Ted looks at Billy in amazement.

WIDE SHOT

As the two of them enter the school and disappear from view.

INT. OFFICE, TED'S AGENCY  DAY

ON THE ELEVATOR DOORS

As they open and Ted steps out looking like the wrath of

God. THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH HIM as he crosses the waiting

room toward the inner offices.

ON THE RECEPTIONIST

Glancing up as he passes.

ON TED

Looking at her like she has lost her mind. Nevertheless he

continues on, passing through swinging doors into a long

corridor lined with secretaries' desks and offices leading

off of it.

Suddenly a younger man rushes up, grabs Ted's hand and starts

to pump it vigorously.

Another nut. Ted smiles at the man, humoring him and continues

toward his office. O'Connor appears, throwing his arm around

Ted, squeezing him in a bear hug.

Suddenly Ted realizes that all these people are congratulating

him for getting the Fire and Ice account.

INT. O'CONNOR'S OFFICE  DAY

Ted and O'Connor sitting across from one another. O'Connor

has just heard the news.

O'Connor nods sympathetically. Actually he is praying that

Ted won't start to cry.

Ted nods in agreement. There is a beat of silence as both

men consider Joanna's imminent return. Then:

ON O'CONNOR

Clearly he doesn't believe this.

INT. FOYER  KRAMER APT.  DAY

INSERT: TIGHT ON AN ENVELOPE

It is postmarked Denver, Colorado. The letter is addressed

to Billy Kramer and it is from Joanna.

ON TED

As he rips open the letter.

ON BILLY

He sits in the living room watching television, a chocolate

doughnut in one hand and a remote control device for watching

television in the other.

Off-screen Sound: a Saturday morning kiddie program from the

television set.

Instantly, Billy turns down the volume of the television.

ON TED

As he starts to read, slowly, carefully, so that Billy can

absorb it.

As Ted continues to read, Billy starts turning up the sound

on the television, using the remote control device.

By now the volume from the television is so loud that Ted

has to shout to make himself heard over it.

HIS POV

Billy sits, watching television with an almost ferocious

intensity on his face, doing his best to block out Ted's

voice.

ON TED

He watches his son for a second, then carefully refolds the

letter, puts it away.

INT. KITCHEN  KRAMER APT.  LATER THAT DAY

CLOSE ON THELMA

Reading Joanna's letter.

She finishes the letter, looks up at Ted.

REVERSE ON TED

He nods.

CROSS-CUTTING BETWEEN THEM:

Ted nods.

ON THELMA

A long pause, she looks at him with all the warmth of a top

sergeant facing a raw recruit. Then:

ON TED

He hasn't the foggiest idea.

ON TED

As he grabs a piece of paper and starts writing frantically.

INT. TED'S BEDROOM  DAY

WIDE SHOT

Ted stands in the middle of the room, sorting out a huge

pile of dirty clothes. Thelma sits on the edge of the bed,

watching.

In the BACKGROUND we SEE the bathroom door as it opens and

Billy Kramer steps out, freshly bathed and wearing clean

clothes.

Billy immediately turns on his heels and heads back into the

bathroom.

INT. LIVING ROOM  KRAMER APT.  DAY

CLOSE ON A SILVER CIGARETTE BOX

That is inscribed, "Ted and Joanna Kramer, Married April 4,

1970."

HOLD FOR A BEAT then Ted's hand reaches into FRAME and picks

it up.

MEDIUM SHOT TED

As he takes the cigarette box and balances it on a stack of

scrap books, photographs, ash trays, etc., etc., that he is

carrying. He crosses to another table, picks up a framed

photograph of Joanna and Billy and piles that on top of

everything. We realize that Ted is going through the apartment

from top to bottom and methodically cleaning out every trace

of Joanna that he can find.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING  NIGHT

ESTABLISHING SHOT

INT. LIVING ROOM  KRAMER APT.  NIGHT

WIDE SHOT

As Ted goes through the room, picking up Billy's clothes

which have been strewn every which way.

THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH HIM as he carries them into Billy's

room.

INT. BILLY'S ROOM  NIGHT

Billy is fast asleep, the only light coming from the night

lamp on the dresser. Ted dumps the soiled clothing in a

hamper, hangs up Billy's jacket, then he neatly folds the

boy's sweater and crosses to the dresser.

CLOSER IN ON THE DRESSER

As Ted opens a drawer and starts to put the sweater away.

Suddenly he spots something.

HIS POV

There, in the drawer, sitting on top of a pile of clothing

is one of the photographs of Joanna that Ted put away this

afternoon.

Billy has retrieved it and hidden it here, hoping that Ted

wouldn't find it.

CLOSE ON TED

As he takes a long look at the photograph, then turns to his

son.

HIS POV

Billy asleep, tangled up in the covers.

ON TED

He removes the photograph from the drawer, crosses to the

bed and places it on the nightstand nearby so that Billy

will be able to see the picture of Joanna when he wakes up

in the morning. He sits for a moment longer on the side of

the bed and reaches across and smooths down his son's rumpled

hair.

INT. TED'S OFFICE  LATE AFTERNOON

ON TED

Clearly in a rush, loading his briefcase with work to do

that evening. He starts for the door and THE CAMERA TRACKS

WITH HIM as he walks along the outer office corridor, heading

for the elevator. As he passes the door to O'Connor's office:

Reluctantly Ted stops, turns around and walks back to the

door to O'Connor's office.

INT. O'CONNOR'S OFFICE  LATE AFTERNOON

O'Connor sits back in his chair, his feet propped on the

desk a drink in one hand.

REVERSE ON TED

Hanging in the doorway, clearly anxious to leave.

And before O'Connor can say anything he is gone.

REVERSE ON O'CONNOR

Obviously displeased. He sits for a moment, drumming his

fingers on the desk top, then reaches for the phone and starts

to dial. A moment later:

EXT. OFFICE BUILDING  LATE AFTERNOON

WIDE SHOT

As Ted emerges from the building, starts to hail a cab.

EXT. APARTMENT HOUSE, EAST EIGHTIES  LATE AFTERNOON

WIDE SHOT

As the cab pulls to a stop. Ted leaps out and rushes inside.

INT. HALLWAY  APARTMENT BLDG.  LATE AFTERNOON

The elevator doors open and Ted steps out.

THE CAMERA PANS WITH HIM as he crosses to the doorway of an

apartment, rings the bell.

CLOSER IN

As the door is opened by a pleasant-looking woman in her

thirties.

This is MRS. KLINE. She has the slightly haggard look of

someone who has just survived a birthday party with eight

five-year-olds.

In fact, behind her we SEE an abundance of crepe paper and

balloons.

THEIR POV

Billy, his coat on, his goody bag in his lap sits alone on a

bench in the foyer.

The moment he sees his father, he gets up and starts for the

door.

And he hustles his father out into the hallway. Once door is

shut behind them:

By now they have crossed to the elevator. Ted rings the bell.

The elevator doors open.

And the doors close, blocking them from view.

INT. LIVING ROOM  KRAMER APT.  NIGHT

WIDE SHOT

Ted and Billy sit at the dining table, a large pizza between

them.

Ted is working hard, trying to establish some kind of rapport

with his son. Billy is silent, he picks at the slice of pizza

in front of him.

There is a long beat of silence.

WIDE SHOT

As Billy shuffles off toward his room. Ted sits for a beat

picking at the food on his plate.

THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH BILLY as he gets up from the table

and walks into his room. HOLD IN THE DOORWAY as he takes off

his shirt and pants and leaves them lying on the floor. The

boy crosses to the closet, gets his pajamas and puts them

on.

REVERSE ON TED

Standing in the doorway, watching.

ON BILLY

He starts to crawl into bed.

THE CAMERA PANS WITH HIM as he crosses to where Billy dropped

his clothes on the floor, picks them up.

Silence.

Ted crosses, sits on the edge of the bed.

Silence.

CLOSEUP BILLY

His face is turned to the wall. HOLD FOR A BEAT as we SEE

him nod.

INT. LIVING ROOM  TED KRAMER'S APT.  NIGHT

Note: The following scene, which is written as one, is

actually to be played so that each time we cut back to the

woman who is being interviewed as housekeeper, it is a

different woman: sometimes nervous and excited, sometimes

large and lugubrious, with six shopping bags, sometimes

looking like a headmistress at Dachau.

They are uniformly (until the last) unappetizing.

Throughout this, we SEE Ted becoming increasingly desperate.

Note: With the FOURTH WOMAN we begin on a CLOSEUP and PULL

BACK to REVEAL that we are in Ted's office and it is the

middle of the afternoon.

INT. TED KRAMER'S OFFICE  DAY

At that point the door behind her opens and O'Connor pokes

his head in.

INT. LIVING ROOM  KRAMER APT.  NIGHT

ON THE FIFTH WOMAN (MRS. WILLEWSKA)

She is a slightly built attractive woman in her early sixties.

There is a long pause as she looks around.

REACTION  TED

This is the first person that ever asked about Billy.

As they start toward the child's room.

INT. BILLY'S ROOM  NIGHT

In the darkness we can SEE Billy, all scrunched up in the

covers.

HOLD FOR A BEAT as the door opens and the light from the

hall falls across the sleeping boy.

ON THE DOOR

Ted and Mrs. Willewska stand silhouetted against the light.

ON BILLY

As he stirs, in his sleep.

REACTION, TED

This is the first time since Joanna left that this has

occurred to him.

INT. SUPERMARKET  DAY

ON BILLY AND TED

TRACKING JUST IN FRONT OF THEM as they wheel a shopping cart

along the aisle. Ted has a shopping list in his hand.

Ted stops, takes a box of detergent off of the shelf, starts

to put it in the shopping cart, when:

Ted looks at his son for a moment, then carefully replaces

the detergent that he had originally picked and reaches for

the green and yellow kind. They continue on for several steps

and Ted stops again, this time looking for a dishwashing

liquid. He starts to reach for one, stops, looks around at

Billy.

Billy shakes his head.

Ted points to another.

Ted takes a bottle of the pink stuff, puts it in the shopping

cart and consults his shopping list.

EXT. PLAYGROUND, CENTRAL PARK  DAY

WIDE SHOT

It is that same afternoon and Billy (his clothes are much

dirtier by now) is running back and forth with a group of

other children.

ON TED

He sits on one of the playground benches, the work he took

from the office stacked beside him on the bench. Sitting

next to him is a personable-looking man of about Ted's age.

He is nattily dressed in a suit complete with vest, tie and

polished Gucci loafers. We will call him THE SATURDAY FATHER.

Note: The Saturday Father and his daughter (a pretty young

girl of about ten) will appear from time to time throughout

the film. He is a divorced father, putting in his time, not

giving a shit about the child. The Saturday Father insists

on treating Ted as though they were members of the same secret

fraternity. And he comes to represent Ted's nightmare of

what might happen to him.

CLOSER ON TED

Finding this distinctly unpleasant. He glances around, looking

for Billy.

HIS POV

The sprinkler area. Other children are running around, but

there is no sign of Billy.

HIS POV

Another area of the playground. Billy is nowhere in sight.

WIDER ON TED

As he grabs his stuff and starts toward the exit of the

playground.

HIS POV

Looking in another direction. Nothing.

WIDE ON TED

Standing among a crowd of people just outside the entrance

to the playground. He is looking around wildly.

HIS POV

There in the distance is Billy Kramer, running as hard as he

can away from Ted.

ON TED

TRACKING IN FRONT OF HIM as he starts to chase after Billy.

HIS POV  TRACKING FORWARD

It is clear that Billy is running with a purpose.

Billy pays no attention to him.

ON TED

TRACKING IN FRONT OF HIM as he continues to chase his son.

HIS POV  TRACKING FORWARD

Closer now, we can SEE that ahead of Billy is a woman that,

from behind, looks remarkably like Joanna.

CLOSER ON TED

As he realizes what is about to happen.

CLOSER ON BILLY

Catching up to the woman.

A moment later he gets close enough to grab onto her skirt.

As the woman turns around:

CLOSEUP WOMAN

Quite clearly it is not Joanna.

CLOSEUP BILLY

His face becomes impassive again. All the excitement vanishes.

CLOSEUP TED

His face reveals all of the pain that Billy's can't.

INT. CLASSROOM, NURSERY SCHOOL  DAY

CLOSE ON A HOMEMADE CURTAIN

As it opens and Billy Kramer, wearing an outsized moustache,

a makeshift cape and a stovepipe hat made from construction

paper.

He stands for a moment, looking around, finally he spots

someone, grins and begins waving.

HIS POV

Across the room eighteen to twenty mothers (Ted Kramer is

the only man present) are gathered, sitting on tiny chairs

and at work tables watching as their children put on a show.

ON BILLY

Suddenly he forgets his lines, looks around nervously. A

moment later a very pretty young teacher leans over, whispers

in his ear.

REVERSE ON TED

He leans forward mouthing the words as the teacher prompts

Billy.

Ted breathes a sigh of relief, his son having gotten through

it.

CROSS-CUTTING BETWEEN THE CHILDREN PUTTING ON THE SHOW AND

TED KRAMER SITTING IN THE AUDIENCE WATCHING:

A look of total pleasure on his face. From time to time when

Billy does something particularly difficult, Ted nudges the

woman next to him.

Note: In all of the shots of Billy we SEE the teacher there

guiding, helping, over and over and over we cannot help but

notice how attractive she is. Toward the end of the show

Ted's POV occasionally follows the teacher rather than the

child.

WIDE SHOT

The show is over and the parents and children mill around

eating popcorn, drinking lemonade from paper cups. Ted stands

off to one side, talking to the teacher as Billy runs around.

CLOSER IN ON THEM

At that moment one of the class mothers interrupts, reaches

across Ted and takes hold of the teacher's hand.

CLOSE ON TED

Inadvertently glancing at the teacher's stomach, nothing

shows.

ON THE TEACHER

As she turns back to Ted.

As Ted begins beating a hasty retreat,

EXT. STREET  DAY

ON TED

TRACKING IN FRONT OF HIM as he walks down the street carrying

a large and elaborate papier-mache art thing that Billy made

in school.

CROSS-CUTTING BETWEEN TED AND HIS POV:

As he manages to notice every single pretty girl that passes,

thread his way through the crowd and still balance Billy's

enormous work of art.

INT. AGENCY  DAY

ON THE ELEVATOR DOORS

As they open, Ted squeezes off and AS THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH

HIM, he crosses the waiting room and enters the offices

proper. He pauses at his secretary's desk and deposits Billy's

papier-mache thing. She jumps up from her desk, takes the

papier-mache thing and her notebook in hand, and follows Ted

as he walks down the corridor towards O'Connor's office.

By now they have reached the board room. He enters without

knocking, his secretary still in tow.

INT. BOARD ROOM  DAY

The room is filled with executives in three piece suits and

O'Connor who is doing a lot of backing and filling.

ON O'CONNOR

Clearly he is very irritated at this.

INT. PHYLLIS BERNARD'S OFFICE  DAY

It is a real mess, legal files and law books scattered

everywhere.

In the midst of all this chaos sits PHYLLIS BERNARD, as we

said before, she is about thirty, very pretty in spite of

her glasses.

ON PHYLLIS

She looks up as Ted enters. It is clear from their attitude

that they have known one another for a long time and are

very relaxed together.

ON TED

He drops into a chair and shoves a stack of papers across

the desk to her.

She takes the papers and starts to rifle through them,

stopping every so often and making a note in the margin. As

she does, we notice that the second and third buttons of her

blouse have come undone and that she is not wearing a bra.

CLOSER ON TED

As he realizes this.

ON PHYLLIS

She glances up to ask Ted a question about some point or

other, notices the direction of his gaze and, unself-

consciously buttons up her blouse.

She goes back to her papers as Ted continues to watch her.

ON PHYLLIS

Not looking up from her papers.

INT. TED KRAMER'S BEDROOM  LATE AT NIGHT

ON THE BED

Although the room is dimly lit, we can SEE quite clearly

that Ted and Phyllis are in bed together. They have finished

making love and Ted lies back, half asleep. Phyllis reaches

across to the nightstand, puts on her glasses and checks her

watch.

But he makes no move to get up.

Phyllis gets to her feet and in the dim light we can SEE

that, except for her glasses, she is naked.

INT. BATHROOM  NIGHT

There is Billy Kramer, standing by the toilet, buttoning his

pajamas. He looks up at Phyllis.

HIS POV

There stands Phyllis, naked as the day she was born, a look

of stunned amazement on her face.

Too startled to cover herself.

ON BILLY

He looks her up and down, then:

ON PHYLLIS

Suddenly remembering to cover herself.

SHOT  PHYLLIS AND BILLY

And he shuffles off to bed. Phyllis waits, frozen until he

disappears into his room. Then, she turns and flees back

into the bedroom.

FROM OFF SCREEN we can hear Billy and Kim running around,

playing.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK  DAY

WIDE SHOT

The Saturday Father and his daughter, clearly with nothing

to say to one another, stand eating ices from a nearby vendor.

THE CAMERA PANS AWAY FROM THEM across to Billy, Ted and

Phyllis. She is dressed in a very nice suit, silk blouse,

high heeled shoes and looks distinctly out of place in Central

Park on a Saturday afternoon.

At the moment, Ted is trying to teach Billy how to bat.

ON PHYLLIS

Watching. She can't believe what she's seeing. Finally, she

can't stand it any longer.

She crosses to Billy, gently takes the bat from him and

demonstrates.

ON TED

As he gives Billy a look that says, we have to humor her. He

throws a ball.

ON PHYLLIS

As she swings, connects and slams a ball in a long, looping

fly that goes at least two hundred feet.

ON TED

Watching the ball disappear in the distance, he turns back

to Phyllis, open-mouthed.

CLOSE ON PHYLLIS

Embarrassed, she grins, shrugs and hands the bat back to

Billy.

INT. O'CONNOR'S OFFICE  DAY

WIDE SHOT

O'Connor, Murray and the Art Director are in O'Connor's office

as the door opens and Ted enters, carrying a pile of papers,

charts, graphs, etc., etc.

He stops in mid-sentence, looks around.

HIS POV

On the walls are a series of mock-ups of the various Fire

and Ice ads, none of which are what Ted and O'Connor had

agreed upon.

Sound-effect: The phone rings.

O'Connor picks it up.

ON TED

He listens for a moment, then hands the phone to Ted.

ON TED

As he takes the receiver.

Then, embarrassed, he turns his back and lowers his voice.

Note: During the phone call, the CAMERA PANS AWAY to Murray

& O'connor, looks of bored Condescension and smug superiority

on their faces.

Ted hangs up the phone and turns back around.

ON TED

Not very reassured.

INT. LIVING ROOM  KRAMER APT.  NIGHT

Ted is sitting at the dining room table, working. Spread out

all across the table are layouts, rate sheets, etc., etc.

Billy sits across from him drawing on a pad with felt-tipped

pens. HOLD FOR A BEAT, then:

beat of silence then:

Silence.

Another beat of silence, then Billy reaches for his glass of

Hawaiian Punch and accidentally tips it over, spilling purple

liquid across all of Ted's papers.

Instantly, Ted is on his feet, yelling.

CROSS-CUTTING BETWEEN THEM:

By now there is nothing the boy can do right.

Billy gets to his feet, collects his stuff and walks into

his bedroom. HOLD ON TED who sits for a moment, then gets

wearily to his feet and as THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH HIM crosses

to the door of Billy's room. He stops in the doorway, looks

OFF SCREEN.

HIS POV

Billy struggling to get his pajamas on, having a hard time.

CROSS-CUTTING BETWEEN THEM:

INT. OFFICE  DAY

ON THE DOOR TO O'CONNOR'S OFFICE

As it opens and Phyllis comes out. In the background in

laughing.

THE CAMERA TRACKS ALONGSIDE Phyllis as she walks to Ted

Kramer's office and opens the door without knocking.

INT. RESTAURANT, MIDTOWN  DAY

ON TED AND PHYLLIS

As they sit across from one another. A waiter stands over

them, setting drinks in front of them.

The waiter bustles away.

She breaks off, uncertain whether or not to go on. Then,

making up her mind, she reaches across, takes Ted's scotch

and soda and drinks half of it down in one gulp.

Phyllis nods.

Phyllis polishes off the rest of Ted's drink.

The waiter sets Ted's drink on the table in front of him. He

starts to reach for it, but Phyllis is quicker.

Ted shrugs.

REACTION, TED

Stunned, but trying to be nonchalant.

INT. TED KRAMER'S OFFICE  DAY

INSERT: The finished proof of the ad that Murray had done,

that Ted had seen in O'Connor's office.

ON TED

TRACKING WITH HIM as he steams out of his door and marches

along the corridor to O'Connor's office.

But it is too late. Ted barrels into O'Connor's office without

bothering to knock.

INT. O'CONNOR'S OFFICE  DAY

O'Connor is alone in the office. He looks up startled as Ted

comes barging in.

INT. DINING AREA  KRAMER APT.  NIGHT

ON BILLY

Who sits looking down at the plate of food in front of him

as though it was a coiled rattlesnake about to strike.

ON TED

Preoccupied, jumpy. He is eating, but he doesn't taste a

thing.

Reluctantly, Billy takes a tiny bite. He barely puts it in

his mouth before he spits it out with a great show of being

physically ill.

He reaches across and scrapes most of the sauce off of the

meat.

By now both of them are out of control.

Billy takes his plate and looking his father straight in the

eye deliberately overturns it, spilling food everywhere.

ON TED

He is out of his chair like a shot, crosses to Billy and

jerks him to his feet.

He half-carries, half-drags the child kicking and screaming

into his room. THE CAMERA TRACKS ALONGSIDE THEM.

By now they have reached Billy's room. Ted dumps him on the

bed unceremoniously and starts out of the room.

And he slams the door behind him.

WIDE SHOT

The dining area. Ted sits down and tries to resume his meal

alone.

CLOSER IN ON TED

As he lifts his glass to take a drink and we can SEE that he

is shaking like a leaf.

INT. KITCHEN  NIGHT

ON TED

As he finishes doing the last of the dishes, dries his hands

and looks around to make sure that everything has been put

away. He flips off the light and, as THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH

HIM, he walks from room to room, turning off the lights,

until he reaches the door to Billy's room which is still

closed. Ted hesitates for a moment, then eases open the door

and steps inside.

INT. BILLY'S ROOM  NIGHT

TED'S POV

Billy lies sprawled across the bed, all tangled up in the

covers.

ON TED

As he crosses to the sleeping child and starts to straighten

the covers.

He starts to get up, when:

ON TED

Stunned at the question.

There is a beat of silence, then:

The boy begins to weep.

There is a long beat of silence as Billy thinks about this.

Clearly an enormous burden has been lifted from his shoulders.

Finally:

Billy nods.

Ted gets to his feet, starts for the door.

Ted pauses in the doorway, smiles.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK  DAY

SERIES OF TRACKING SHOTS

As Ted runs along beside Billy, who is learning to ride a

bike.

Then, in the last shot, Ted lets go of the bike and runs

along just behind. Slowly as Billy gains confidence he speeds

up, leaving Ted farther and farther behind. Finally, as Billy

glances over his shoulders.

TED'S POV

As the boy, by now a considerable distance away, turns and

waves.

ON TED

Waving back, a grin of enormous pride on his face. He glances

around, embarrassed to make sure no one is watching and wipes

tears from his eyes.

EXT. STREET  DAY

ON A BUS

As it pulls to a stop and a mob of mothers and children get

off.

Among them we spot Billy and Ted Kramer. THE CAMERA PANS

WITH THEM as they cross the street and enter the school

building. THE CAMERA CONTINUES IT'S PAN across the street,

to a Coffee Shop with large plate glass windows facing the

school. There, standing in the window, watching, is Joanna

Kramer. HOLD AS THE CAMERA SLOWLY ZOOMS IN ON HER and we SEE

a look of overwhelming pain on her face.

EXT. PLAYGROUND, CENTRAL PARK  AFTERNOON

ON TED AND THELMA

Sitting on a bench, the area around them is stacked high

with toys that the kids have brought with them to the park.

OFF SCREEN we can HEAR Billy and Kim racing around, playing.

There is a beat of silence, then:

Ted glances around:

HIS POV

Billy and Kim are standing near the jungle Jim. Billy has a

toy airplane in his hand.

And he begins to race around the area, making jet noises and

holding the airplane in his hand.

REVERSE ON TED

Watching him, smiling.

ON BILLY

Weaving in and around the benches. He turns and starts back

towards Ted. As he does:

QUICK CUT: INSERT:

Billy's foot, as he trips.

ON BILLY

As he starts to fall, still holding onto the airplane.

QUICK CUT: TED

Watching, horrified.

ON BILLY

As he hits the concrete.

ON TED

He leaps to his feet, starts toward the boy.

ON BILLY

As he looks up.

JUMP CUT IN TO EXTREME CLOSEUP

There is a terrible-looking gash running from his cheek into

his hairline.

Kim screams at the sight of the blood.

EXT. ENTRANCE TO CENTRAL PARK  AFTERNOON

ON THE ENTRANCE

As Ted, carrying Billy, wrapped in his coat, comes barreling

out of the park, nearly knocking over several people with

shopping bags, and begins running like hell WITH THE CAMERA

TRACKING JUST IN FRONT OF HIM. In the BACKGROUND we SEE Thelma

and Kim chasing after him. THE LENGTH OF THE TRACKING SHOT

SHOULD BE MUCH LONGER THAN WE EXPECT. IT SHOULD, IN FACT,

COVER THE THREE CITY BLOCKS BETWEEN THE KRAMER APARTMENT AND

THE HOSPITAL, ACROSS STREETS WITHOUT STOPPING FOR THE LIGHT,

ALONG CROWDED SIDEWALKS WITHOUT STOPPING, ENDING FINALLY ON

THE EMERGENCY ENTRANCE TO THE HOSPITAL. IT MUST BE GENUINELY

SUPERHUMAN, GENUINELY HEROIC.

INT. EXAMINATION ROOM, EMERGENCY SECTION, HOSPITAL  DAY

ON TED KRAMER

He is covered with Billy's blood, it is on his face, his

shirt, his trousers. At the moment 'he stands helpless,

watching as, Off-Screen, a surgeon examines Billy's wound.

WIDER SHOT

Billy lies on the examining table with the doctor bending

over him.

Billy doesn't say anything.

The doctor motions for Thelma to wait with Billy and he

crosses to Ted who stands in the doorway.

CLOSER IN ON THEN

REACTION TED

Ted closes his eyes, there is a sharp intake of breath.

Ted nods.

CLOSE ON TED

He holds his son tightly while the doctor stitches up the

boy's wound. From THIS CAMERA ANGLE we can SEE Ted's face,

but only the back of Billy's head. Although we do not see

the stitches being made, we do SEE the doctor's hand, with

the needle and surgical thread as it moves into and out of

view with a slow, steady rhythm. Billy's hand clutches Ted's

so tightly that the knuckles are white.

EXT. KRAMER APT. BLDG.  NIGHT

WIDE SHOT

It is late, only a few lights are still on.

INT. BILLY'S ROOM  NIGHT

ON BILLY

He lies in bed, fast asleep, his head swathed in bandages.

THE CAMERA PANS AWAY FROM HIM across to Ted, who sits in a

nearby rocking chair, watching his son. HOLD FOR A BEAT,

then Ted gets to his feet, walks quietly to the door and

steps out into the hall, closing the door behind him.

INT. KITCHEN  NIGHT

WIDE SHOT

Thelma having washed and dried the dishes is now wiping off

the top of the counter top, more to keep busy than anything

else. She looks around as Ted enters.

REVERSE ON TED

Standing in the doorway. He hasn't changed his clothes and

he is still covered with blood.

Thelma nods. She watches Ted closely. He doesn't look at

her.

Silence. Thelma looks away from him.

Silence. She still cannot look at him.

Thelma nods, unable to speak.

She nods again.

INT. BILLY'S ROOM  EARLY MORNING

MEDIUM SHOT ON BILLY

As he lies in bed asleep. Some time has passed and Billy's

bandage is much smaller. HOLD ON HIM as we HEAR OFF SCREEN

Sound: From the street below, the regular six-forty-five

garbage truck that serves as Billy's alarm clock.

HOLD ON BILLY

As he wakes up, struggles to his feet.

THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH HIM as, eyes closed, he stumbles into

the bathroom, pees, and still not remembering to flush the

toilet walks into the bedroom and wakes his father. As the

child turns and walks toward the kitchen, THE CAMERA HOLDS

ON TED. He heaves himself to his feet and, eyes closed, in

much the same manner as his son, stumbles into the bathroom.

He automatically flushes the toilet without bothering to

look, walks into the living room, opens the front door and

picks up the paper. As he starts into the kitchen, he meets

Billy coming the other way carrying two plates, a doughnut

on each.

THE CAMERA NOW TRACKS WITH BILLY as he walks into the living

room, carefully sets the plates on the dining table, crosses

to the television set, and turns it on. He returns to the

table, and sits down as Ted appears carrying two glasses of

orange juice and vitamins. He takes a seat in the chair

opposite Billy and opens his paper and starts to read.

HOLD ON THEM as they sit without talking, eating their

breakfast  the only sound, a children's cartoon program

coming from the T.V.

From time to time Ted glances up from his paper to look across

at the cartoon.

HOLD ON THEM as we SEE that they have become roommates in

the best sense of the word.

EXT. TED'S OFFICE BLDG.  MIDTOWN  DAY

WIDE SHOT

It is a gray, cloudy day in mid-November. Snow is falling.

Sound-effect: a telephone ringing. Then:

INT. RESTAURANT, ISLE OF CAPRI  NIGHT

ON THE DOOR

As Ted enters, looks around. The Maitre d'hotel approaches.

From his attitude, it is clear that Ted and Joanna were

regular customers.

THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH TED as he walks toward the back room

of the restaurant. Several waiters approach and say hello,

the piano player looks up and smiles. As he reaches the door

to the back room.

INT. BACK ROOM

TED'S POV  JOANNA

She sits against the wall, a glass of white wine in front of

her.

She is dressed simply and no longer has a tan. Nevertheless,

Joanna is still stunningly beautiful. HOLD ON HER FOR A BEAT

as she looks up, smiles.

ON TED

He stands watching her, his knees weak. It is impossible not

to fall in love with her all over again.

TWO SHOT

As he crosses to her table, sits down.

The waiter appears, carrying a scotch and soda. He sets it

down on the table in front of Ted.

The waiter nods and promptly disappears.

There is a self-conscious pause. From the bar, the piano

player begins playing a new song. From Ted and Joanna's

reaction, it is clearly a song that has meant a great deal

to them in the past.

They listen for a moment, then:

ON TED

The question he has been dreading.

There is a beat of silence. A moment of shared feeling.

For the first time he looks up at her.

CROSS-CUTTING BETWEEN THEM:

ON TED

Speechless.

Silence.

Silence.

There is a beat of silence, then:

ON TED

He reacts as though he has been slapped.

And with that he turns on his heels and stalks out of the

restaurant.

INT. LAWYER'S OFFICE  DAY

WIDE SHOT

A large, very plush office: lots of antiques, beautiful

nineteenth century paintings on the wall along with

autographed photographs of at least three ex-Presidents of

the United States. Sitting behind a large and imposing desk

is JOHN SHAUNESSY, a handsome, formidable man in his early

sixties. He is well-dressed, a cornflower in his buttonhole,

that sort of thing. At the moment, Shaunessy leans back in

his chair as Ted finishes his story.

Ted nods.

Ted nods.

REACTION TED

That's an astronomical amount of money to him.

ON SHAUNESSY

He shakes his head.

ON TED

Agitated. This is not what he wanted to hear.

He digs in his pockets, pulls out a piece of paper and thrusts

it at the lawyer.

INT. LIVING ROOM  KRAMER APT.  LATE AT NIGHT

WIDE SHOT

Ted sits at the dining table, the supper dishes have been

pushed aside. He has a legal pad in front of him and is

writing. THE CAMERA DOLLIES IN CLOSER.

INSERT  TED'S POV

The legal pad. On one side Ted has written "Pro" and on the

other, "Con." Underneath "Con" Ted has written a long list

of the drawbacks involved in keeping Billy: Sex Life, Money,

Possibility of Remarriage, Sleep, Emotional Dependence. The

"Pro" side of the list is empty.

ON TED

He sits for a moment, staring at the list, then he crumples

the paper, gets to his feet.

INT. BILLY'S ROOM  NIGHT

ON THE DOOR

As Ted enters. He crosses to Billy's bed where the child is

fast asleep, sits down on the edge, and starts to rub the

child's back.

Ted kisses the child, gets to his feet and starts toward the

door.

INT. O'CONNOR'S OFFICE  DAY

WIDE SHOT

O'Connor stands with his back to Ted, looking out the window.

From the beginning this is clearly an awkward and unpleasant

moment.

CLOSE ON TED

Hold on him listening as it slowly dawns on him that he is

being fired.

ON O'CONNOR

He still has his back to Ted.

Ted, I want  O'Connor looks around.

HIS POV

The room is empty, the door stands open and Ted is gone.

As he walks along the street in a state of total shock. Behind

him, in the windows of expensive stores we note Christmas

decorations.

INT. INTERVIEW ROOM, EMPLOYMENT AGENCY  DAY

WIDE SHOT

Ted sits across from the interviewer, a polished young man

in his middle twenties, very efficient, he sounds a bit like

a tape recording.

EXT. STREET  DAY

ON A TELEPHONE BOOTH

Ted stands inside, talking on the phone. AS THE CAMERA DOLLIES

IN CLOSER, he hangs up the receiver and takes the employment

section of the New York Times which is filled with listings

he has circled and crosses off one. He goes on to the next,

takes a dime from the stack on the shelf in front of him and

starts to dial.

EXT. TED KRAMER'S APT. HOUSE  EVENING

ESTABLISHING SHOT

INT. KITCHEN  NIGHT

ON TED

Who stands at the sink doing the last of the dishes. A

dishtowel is tucked into his belt, serving as an apron. HOLD

ON HIM as we HEAR:

Sound-effect: The phone ringing.

Ted wipes his hands, picks up the phone.

Then, a moment later:

There is a long pause, too long.

Ted doubles over the phone like he has been hit in the

stomach.

INT. INTERVIEW ROOM  EMPLOYMENT AGENCY  DAY

WIDE SHOT

The same young man sits across the desk from Ted.

CLOSE ON TED

Leaning forward, impatient.

CROSS-CUTTING BETWEEN THEM:

The interviewer gives Ted a weary look. Then he starts to

flip through the card file.

Finally he pauses at one card, pulls it out.

Ted is already on his feet and halfway out the door.

INT. OFFICE ADVERTISING MANAGER, J. WALTER THOMPSON  LATE

AFTERNOON

It is dark outside and the lights are on in the office. From

beyond the door, we can hear the sounds of a Christmas office

party in full swing.

ON JACK ACKERMAN

The advertising manager. A balding man in his mid-forties,

he wears a suit, complete with vest. At the moment he sits

behind his desk listening to Ted's spiel, from time to time

he glances at the resume on the desk in front of him.

ON TED

As he finishes. He sits back, pleased with himself.

CROSS-CUTTING BETWEEN THEM:

He gets to his feet, starts to shake Ted's hand, ready to

end the interview.

Ackerman gives Ted a long, considered look, then:

He turns and goes out the door.

INT. OUTER OFFICE, J. WALTER THOMPSON  LATE AFTERNOON

The large room is crowded with secretaries, junior executives,

researchers, editors, ad-men, etc., etc. They all have drinks

in their hands and there is a good deal of kissing and general

conviviality going on.

THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH ACKERMAN as he steps out of his office,

closes the door behind him and makes his way across the room

to MR. SPENCER, the Advertising Director. At the moment,

Spencer stands with his coat over one arm and a drink in his

hand talking to a very pretty young woman. Ackerman approaches

him, whispers something in his ear. Spencer shakes his head

and points to his watch. Ackerman says something else and

finally, with a look of weary resignation, Spencer excuses

himself from the pretty young woman and follows Ackerman

back to his office. THE CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM. As Ackerman

opens the door to his office, THE CAMERA IS ANGLED so that

we can SEE past them, into the office where Ted stands

waiting.

As the door closes behind them, blocking our view, THE CAMERA

PANS UP to a clock over the door. It reads five-fifteen.

INT. ACKERMAN'S OFFICE  LATE AFTERNOON

ON A CLOCK

Which now reads five twenty-two. THE CAMERA PULLS BACK TO

REVEAL Spencer, now sitting in Ackerman's chair, his feet on

Ackerman's desk. Ted has just finished his pitch.

Spencer gets to his feet, starts to retrieve his coat.

ON TED

As he decides to take a gamble.

ON SPENCER

Almost at the door, looking around.

ON TED

Checking his watch.

Spencer nods.

There is a long beat of silence as Spencer and Ackerman look

at one another. They were clearly not prepared for this.

OUTER OFFICE  LATE AFTERNOON

ON TED

As he steps out of Ackerman's office, sits down. Now, all of

the fear, all of the anxiety that he has been fighting down

comes welling up. What if he pushed too hard? What will he

do if he doesn't get a job? If Ted Kramer could fall to his

knees and pray, he would.

CROSS-CUT WITH THE CHRISTMAS PARTY

That swirls around him. We notice in particular, one very

pretty young woman flirting with a number of men. She is

wearing a dress with straps, one of them has broken and she

has patched it with a piece of masking tape.

Finally the door to Ackerman's office opens and he steps

out.

Ted jumps to his feet, starts into the office.

INT. ACKERMAN'S OFFICE  LATE AFTERNOON

ON SPENCER

He looks at Ted carefully for a long time, then:

CLOSEUP TED

There is an instant of relief, then, with astounding cool:

ANOTHER ANGLE

As they shake hands, say their good-byes. THE CAMERA TRACKS

WITH TED as he makes his way through the Christmas party

that is still going strong. Then, suddenly, as he passes the

very pretty woman we noticed earlier, he turns and kisses

her.

QUICK CUTS

As a look passes between them, a sudden chemistry, something

we have not seen in Ted before.

EXT. STREET  DAY

ON A BUS

As it pulls to a stop, the doors open and, along with the

usual flood of mothers and children we SEE Ted and Billy.

THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH THEM as they walk to school. Billy is

talking a mile a minute, describing in minute detail the

plot of an episode of "I Dream of Jeannie." Ted listens

intently, then, almost involuntarily, he glances over his

shoulder in the direction of the Coffee Shop.

HIS POV

There, standing in the window, watching, is Joanna.

ON TED AND BILLY

As they continue to walk. Ted's eyes remain on Joanna. As

they reach the door to the school, Ted looks at his son.

He stands watching as Billy rushes off into the building.

Then he turns back and once again looks in the direction of

the Coffee Shop.

HIS POV

This time there is no one there.

Horrified.

EXT. FIFTH AVE. SIDE OF CENTRAL PARK  DAY

ON TED AND BILLY

TRACKING IN FRONT OF THEM as they walk along the Central

Park side of Fifth Ave. From their attitude it is clear that

each of them, for their own reasons, is very nervous.

TED'S POV  TRACKING FORWARD

About half a block away Joanna paces back and forth. She

hasn't seen them and it is clear that she is as nervous as

they are.

ANOTHER ANGLE ON TED AND BILLY

Ted stops, turns to Billy and gives him a last-minute check.

Then, spotting a smudge he takes his handkerchief, spits on

it and wipes the child's chin. Now satisfied, he takes Billy's

hand and they continue. Suddenly:

CLOSEUP BILLY

As he spots his mother.

QUICK CUT: JOANNA

As she turns, spots Billy, starts to run.

ON BILLY

TRACKING WITH HIM as he lets go of Ted's hand and starts to

run flat out toward his mother. She kneels, opens her arms

wide for him and he goes barreling into her, almost knocking

her down from the impact.

WIDER SHOT

Joanna gets to her feet and takes Billy's hand.

And they start off in the opposite direction.

ON TED

Realizing that Billy has not said good-bye, has not looked

at him once.

WIDER SHOT

Ted stands helpless, watching them leave.

WIDER SHOT

Ted, now almost lost from view on the crowded street, still

hasn't moved.

WIDE SHOT

Ted and Phyllis, getting ready to go to bed. They look like

a couple that has been married at least five years. Ted is

busy talking as he takes off his tie, jacket and starts to

unbutton his shirt. Phyllis is getting undressed also, hanging

things in the closet, putting things away in drawers. But as

Ted continues to talk, she watches him apprehensively, it is

clear that something is wrong.

CLOSE ON TED

He stops what he is doing, turns to her.

REACTION  TED

He sits down on the bed.

She shakes her head, then, reaches out and touches him.

INT. KRAMER APT.  DAY

As Ted carries her coat to the closet, Dr. Alvarez walks

into the living room, looks around.

CROSS-CUTTING BETWEEN THEM:

They cross to the door of Billy's room. Ted opens it.

INT. BILLY'S ROOM  DAY

THEIR POV

The room is a mess, blocks are stacked everywhere. Billy

sits in the middle playing with his toys.

ON TED AND DR. ALVAREZ

They stand in the doorway.

There is an awkward pause as Ted remains in the doorway.

Reluctantly, Ted leaves, closing the door behind him.

THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH HIM as he crosses the living room to

the couch where he has a stack of legal books and a number

of note pads spread out. He is obviously continuing his legal

education.

THROUGH OUT THE FOLLOWING, THE CAMERA REMAINS ON HIS FACE.

Ted by now has given up all pretense of working. He wags his

pencil in the direction of the door.

REACTION  TED

Eyes wide. He starts to get up.

This brings Ted all the way to his feet. He starts across

the living room headed for the door to Billy's room.

Ted has his hand on the doorknob, about to enter.

EXT. MODERN OFFICE BUILDING, MIDTOWN  DAY

It is a pleasant enough office, but nothing spectacular,

windows that look out over Fifty-seventh Street, simple

Formica furniture, that sort of thing.

ON THE DOOR

As they enter.

Billy crosses to the window, presses his nose to the glass,

looks out.

Ted nods, walks over to the desk and begins collecting

paperwork to do over the weekend. As he does, Billy goes

through the office, sitting in every chair, looking in every

drawer.

Billy plops himself down in Ted's chair, swivels around.

Shaunessy waits.

great compassion for Joanna.

REACTION  TED

Stunned.

There is a long pause, then:

And with that he hands both the judge and Shaunessy a thick

sheaf of papers. Then, turning his attention back to Joanna:

There is a pause, then:

There is a beat of silence, then:

ON SHAUNESSY

As he stands, collects his papers from the table and, taking

his own sweet time, crosses to Joanna.

Note: During the early part of Shaunessy's cross-examination,

Joanna has been very forthright, very sure of herself. Now,

as he starts getting tougher, she begins to falter.

Her head snaps back as though she's been hit.

Eyes wide. He finds this hard to believe.

He starts to go back to work.

It is a bleak winter's day. THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH THEM as

they walk along, Ted carrying a bag of groceries, Thelma

with cleaning.

The children run around them, playing.

They walk in silence for several beats, each clearly lost in

their own thoughts. Then:

Thelma nods.

Thelma nods.

She leaves the sentence unfinished. They walk in silence for

several more steps. Then she takes his hand.

They walk in silence for a beat, then Ted looks OFF SCREEN,

spots something:

HIS POV

The Saturday Father, restless, bored, walking with his

daughter who is also bored. It is clear that they have nothing

to say to one another. He looks around, spots Ted, waves and

starts in his direction.

walk

along the beach at the edge of the water. THE CAMERA TRACKS

WITH THEM. There are several beats of silence as Ted tries

to think of how to begin. Finally:

Suddenly Ted can't stand it any longer.

Billy hangs back, watching Ted.

The boy turns and runs back along the beach toward the house.

Then, he stops, turns back to look once more at his father.

It is early Monday morning.

INT. KRAMER KITCHEN  MORNING

ON TED AND BILLY

They stand side by side, like a surgeon and his assistant.

Spread out on the counter in front of them are the makings

of French toast. The following is done with great efficiency,

in contrast to the first time we saw them go through the

same ritual. They work in silence except for an occasional

command. Each concentrating on this last moment of closeness,

each doing his best to avoid thinking about Billy's departure.

Finally:

ON BILLY

Looking at his father, trying to memorize the older man's

face.

Ted turns, sees his son watching him.

As they open, Ted steps out, looks around.

HIS POV

The lobby is dark, the only light coming from the window.

Joanna sits off to one side, wearing sunglasses. She looks

up as Ted approaches, a small smile on her face.

He nods.

There is a long pause as she looks at Ted, unable to speak.

Finally:

ON TED

Struck by the urgency in her voice.

Joanna's last ounce of reserve crumbles, she begins to sob.

Ted puts his arms around her and holds her. They do not kiss.

Then, after a few moments she steps back.

They step into the elevator and, as the doors close, blocking

them from view, we...

EXT. STREET  DAY

ON TED AND BILLY

TRACKING JUST IN FRONT OF THEM as they walk to the park.

They are deep in conversation, although we are too far away

to bear what they are saying. HOLD ON THEM and, as they reach

the entrance to the park, Billy first, then Ted begin to

run, overwhelmed with the sheer joy of being alive, of being

together. As they continue to run, THE CAMERA PULLS BACK AND

UP AND WE SEE that they are only two among thousands of

parents and children in Central Park on a sunny afternoon.

THE CAMERA CONTINUES TO PULL BACK until they are lost from

view and it is...
