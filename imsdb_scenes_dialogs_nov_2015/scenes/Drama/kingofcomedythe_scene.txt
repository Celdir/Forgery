1   EXT:   MIDTOWN MANHATTAN STREETS - DAY

PUPKIN carefully places himself near the door, a step or

two away from the other professionals.

PUPKIN shoots a hostile glance back at CELESTE.

SIDNEY starts pulling little white cards out of his paper

bag and reading them off.

PUPKIN has been trying to remain apart from the other

three. Finally he turns to SIDNEY.

The show breaks. The doors swing open and people pour out.

The crowd around the backstage door swells.

A number of people in the crowd hand in pieces of paper.

PUPKIN is standing next to a young couple, about college

age. The YOUNG GIRL has just sent in her paper.

The YOUNG GIRL laughs unself-consciously.

LANGFORD's limousine waits directly in front of the stage

door. MAE has engaged the CHAUFFEUR who stands at the

door of the car in conversation.

The CHAUFFEUR, smiling, shakes his head.

A plain-looking GIRL in a black raincoat and black, floppy

hat stands on the street side of the limousine,

carefully watching MAE and the CHAUFFEUR talk.

We hear a cry as a celebrity emerges from the backstage

door. MAE turns and goes back towards the door.

The POLICEMAN is handing out the autographs. Suddenly

LANGFORD emerges, flanked by three PAGES, husky young men

in their early twenties dressed in theater uniforms.

There is screaming and some yelling of LANGFORD's name.

LANGFORD pays no attention. Smiling nervously, he makes

his way towards the limousine. The CHAUFFEUR stands at

the rear of the car, holding the door. LANGFORD enters

the car and then suddenly springs back. The GIRL in the

black raincoat and black hat has hidden herself in the

back seat of the limousine. The three PAGES, who have

already turned and headed back toward the theater, hear

the commotion and swing around. The GIRL, who we shall

come to know as MARSHA, hides herself in the far end of

the limo, so two of the PAGES go around to the far side

of the car and start pulling her out while the third PAGE

moves into the limo from the street side. She fights

like a wildcat, but the PAGES slowly    manage to drag her

out. During the struggle, LANGFORD     stands amid the crowd,

a bit shaken. PUPKIN stands next to     him, staring at him.

When finally catches LANGFORD's eye,    PUPKIN smiles

pleasantly.

LANGFORD says nothing, glancing nervously at PUPKIN.

A couple YOUNG GIRLS are pressing against LANGFORD.

PUPKIN straightens up for action.

PUPKIN wades through the crowd towards the limousine,

pushing SIDNEY and MAE among others out of the way.

LANGFORD follows in the path PUPKIN is clearing.

The PAGES have succeeded in pulling the GIRL out of the

far door of the limo just as PUPKIN and LANGFORD arrive

at the near door. The CHAUFFEUR has been blocked by the

crowd from opening the door so PUPKIN opens it.

LANGFORD slips in quickly. He looks up at PUPKIN who is

holding the door, smiling pleasantly.

The WAITER leaves.

Eddie arrives. He     is a small, slightly-bald man with

greying hair and a    goatee. He wears a foulard under an

open-necked shirt.     He carries a long sketch pad. He

immediately sets up    a small easel and starts sketching.

PUPKIN smiles broadly.

RITA fills a glass of water and puts in the rose.

PUPKIN pulls out a pack of Rolaids and hands one to RITA

who smiles vaguely and drops it into the glass.

There is an awkward pause.    PUPKIN stares admiringly at

RITA.

RITA stares at PUPKIN as he rattles on.

RITA shakes her head in disbelief and chuckles.

PUPKIN waits for a laugh. RITA just keeps shaking her

head. PUPKIN looks around.

RITA shrugs.

RITA starts laughing.

RITA starts laughing again.

A bull-necked MAN in his early forties enters. He waves

a brief hello to RITA as he walks by. RITA smiles and

the MAN takes a seat at the far end of the bar.

RITA goes to the far end of the bar and serves the MAN a

beer. They chat briefly as PUPKIN watches uneasily.

Finally PUPKIN downs his beer and raises his glass.

The MAN gets RITA's attention for PUPKIN.   RITA returns

to PUPKIN and serves him another beer.

The MAN at the end of the bar raises his glass.

RITA goes to the far end of the bar. She pours him another

beer and settles against the bar, resuming her chat with

him. PUPKIN looks for a moment and downs his beer. He

raises his glass.

RITA returns to him.

RITA turns to go.

RITA returns to the MAN and pours him another beer. PUPKIN

sits for a few moments, then downs his beer quickly. Again,

he raises his glass.

The MAN leans over the bar and tells RITA something. She

opens a bottle of beer and hands it to the MAN who slides

it down the bar towards PUPKIN. As the beer reaches the

middle of the bar, the THIRD MAN seated midway between

PUPKIN and the MAN raises his beer glass to take a sip just

as the sliding beer bottle passes under his hand. The

bottle stops right in front of PUPKIN who takes it and

slides it back with equal force. At this moment, the THIRD

MAN in the middle has finished his sip and has just placed

the THIRD MAN's glass on the counter. The beer bottle

collides with the THIRD MAN's glass, creating a mess. RITA

glares at PUPKIN as does the THIRD MAN. PUPKIN shrugs an

apology and RITA cleans up the mess.

As RITA cleans up the mess and pours a fresh beer, the MAN

walks down the bar towards PUPKIN. He leans over him and

puts a supposedly friendly paw on his shoulder. PUPKIN

glances distastefully at the MAN's hand on him.

PUPKIN looks up at the MAN who pats him on the back in a

gesture of fraudulent friendship and menace. PUPKIN burps.

With an effort, the MAN controls his temper and returns to

his seat at the end of the bar. PUPKIN instantly raises

his glass.

The MAN advances towards PUPKIN with another bottle of

beer. PUPKIN watches passively as the MAN pours half the

bottle into PUPKIN's breast pocket and slams the half-empty

bottle on the counter. The MAN walks down to the end of

the counter where a smiling RITA is waiting.

PUPKIN again gulps his beer down. RITA and the MAN stare

at PUPKIN expecting him to raise his glass and call for

another beer. PUPKIN just sits there. After a few

moments, RITA and the MAN resume their conversation, but

they keep glancing over at PUPKIN, expecting him to

interrupt them with a call for beer at any moment. PUPKIN

continues to sit there. Just as RITA and the MAN have

settled back into their conversation, PUPKIN falls like a

stone from the barstool onto the floor. He lies

motionless. RITA and the MAN look at PUPKIN for a moment

while the handful of other patrons glance at him and return

to their drinks. RITA leaves the bar and goes to the rear

of the restaurant, disappearing into the kitchen. As she

does, the MAN walks over to where PUPKIN is lying inert

and prods him cruelly with his foot.

The MAN turns to the kitchen to see if RITA is returning.

As he does, PUPKIN carefully opens one eye, grabs a free

chair from a nearby cocktail table, rises and bangs the MAN

smartly over the head. The MAN falls, out cold. PUPKIN

straightens up quickly as the other patrons look on with

interest. PUPKIN brushes off his suit, which is blue, just

like the MAN's, and stands above the MAN just as the MAN

stood above him, his back to kitchen. RITA emerges from

the kitchen with the owner, MR. NICHOLS and a large black

COOK.

RITA automatically reaches out as she talks for what she

RITA chuckles to herself.

She starts laughing to herself.

Drysdale

!     Really, Rita!

RITA raises her glass to the WAITER who is standing nearby,

talking with another WAITER. As she does, a nice-looking

young MAN sitting in the middle aisle raises his glass of

beer to her and drinks it, as a kind of toast. RITA

smiles briefly and her eyes return to PUPKIN. The YOUNG

MAN is seated behind PUPKIN, facing RITA. The WAITER comes

over and collects the glass. Throughout the rest of the

scene, a subtle flirtation continues between RITA and the

YOUNG MAN.

RITA starts for a moment, thinking PUPKIN has caught her

looking at the YOUNG MAN.

Somebody

The WAITER arrives with RITA's drink.

PUPKIN slowly pulls out a leather-bound book from his

inside jacket pocket.

PUPKIN expertly flips to a middle page in the book and,

keeping the book open, his finger pointing under a name,

he turns the book to RITA.

RITA starts flipping through the book, curious about the

other names. She isn't paying any attention to what PUPKIN

is saying.

PUPKIN checks the book.

PUPKIN flips to one of the back pages and shows a name to

RITA.

Exasperated, PUPKIN follows the name in question with his

index finger.

PUPKIN tears out the page and hands it to her shyly.   RITA

just stares at it and back at PUPKIN.

RITA start laughing.

RITA laughs harder, despite efforts to be serious.

RITA pulls herself together for a moment.

RITA starts laughing hysterically, in spite of herself.

RITA listens silently for a moment, then begins to giggle.

As PUPKIN resumes speaking, we CUT between RITA and the

YOUNG MAN. Their flirtation picks up steam. The YOUNG MAN

raises his eyebrows as if to ask, "Are you interested in

me?" She smiles. All the while, PUPKIN rattles on.

The telephone at the back of the restaurant starts ringing.

A WAITER in the background moves slowly to answer it.

from the phone booth towards the front of the restaurant.

44   EXT:   A TIMES SQUARE HOTEL - DAY

45   INT:   PUPKIN'S ROOM - DAY

PUPKIN enters. WE SEE that it is a small room, furnished

by the hotel in the plainest way. Nicely-done home-made

collages of show business figures decorate the drab green

walls. The room is neat and clean. PUPKIN goes directly

to a plain table which holds two tape recorders -- one a

small cassette the other a large table tape recorder. He

picks up the microphone of the larger one and speaks into

it.

In the following montage, we hear in the background the

replay of his "testing, testing testing" and various

other noises -- a bit of his voice taped, a burst of

laughter, the squeal of a tape recorder sent fast-forward,

a sudden burst of applause, a scrap of theme music. At the

same time, the CAMERA PANS about the room.    We look

at the collages which include all the obvious show business

figures, with a heavy emphasis on comedians from Chaplin

and Keaton to Sid Caesar and Woody Allen. The collages

also include such varied figures as Jimmy Carter, Julia

Childs, Tom Seaver, David Brinkley, Muhammad Ali, Clifford

Irving, Walter Cronkite and Mark Spitz. There is a special

Kennedy section -- John F. and Bobby framed in black,

Jackie in mourning and a picture of Teddy. There is also a

trio of assassins -- Sirhan, Oswald and James Earl Ray.

There is also a talk show collage with a photo of Langford

in the center like a sun surrounded by Snyder, Walters,

Carson and Griffin. One bookshelf holds a veritable

library of comedy -- joke books, biographies of comedians,

treasuries of American humor. Another shelf holds scores

of tapes in their own little boxes, each one neatly marked,

i.e., "LANGFORD MONOLOGUES:    7/5/72 to 9/9/72." "MISC.

MONOLOGUES 6/13/68 to 8/1/69."

PUPKIN sitting before the tape recorder lost in thought.

Finally, he starts the larger recorder and lifts the mike.

PUPKIN stops the tape recorder and thinks again for a few

beats. He then starts the large recorder.

PUPKIN pushes a button on the cassette and we hear the

theme song of the Jerry Langford Show, followed by the

voice of BERT CANTER, the announcer.

PUPKIN deftly shuts off the cassette and substitutes his

own voice for that of CANTER's. The large tape recorder

keeps rolling.

PUPKIN rapidly races the cassette tape forward, then pushes

down the "play" button. We hear a burst of thundering

applause. PUPKIN lets the applause run for a while and

then shuts it off. The large recorder keeps rolling.

The RECEPTIONIST drops her eyes. A few beats go by. CATHY

LONG passes by the entranceway and glances at PUPKIN.

PUPKIN continues sitting there.

A few beats pass in silence.

PUPKIN remains seated. A few more moments pass. Several

OFFICE PERSONNEL pass by the entranceway and glance at

PUPKIN. After a few more beats, a large, plainly-dressed

MAN in his mid-fifties emerges from the back offices. He

goes over to PUPKIN, who stands.

WIRTZ puts his arm on PUPKIN's shoulder and, as the

following dialogue unfolds leads him out the door, down

the corridor and into the elevator.

A SERVANT places the desert, a little, elegant tart, in

The SERVANT smiles. As PUPKIN continues his story, he

glances occasionally at RITA who has begun to nibble at her

tart. PUPKIN also glances conspiratorially at LANGFORD

who smiles back.

The COMPANY breaks up.

RITA looks up, smiles and blushes. The rest of the COMPANY

smiles benignly and grows attentive as RITA returns to

eating her tart. Suddenly she bites down on something

hard. She fishes it out of her mouth and looks at it. The

COMPANY giggles. It is the ring PUPKIN purchased at

Cartier's. The COMPANY applauds lightly and laughs.

RITA stands in the center of the room, ill at ease, while

PUPKIN strolls about comfortably, picking up an ashtray

here, a cigarette case there, inspecting the artifacts for

inscriptions, clues, hints about LANGFORD's character and

life.

PUPKIN continues to move about the room, fielding RITA's

suspicious inquiries effortlessly.

There is a pause. PUPKIN continues his investigation.      He

has moved to the grand piano in the rear of the room.

PUPKIN is looking    at a picture of an American Gothic couple

standing in front    of a wood-frame house. As he comments on

the pictures, the    CAMERA PANS over them. They form a kind

of slide-show of    LANGFORD's life.

PUPKIN then fixes on a picture of an eleven-year-old boy

standing next to a puppet stage with a puppet (obviously

held by the boy) staring at its master.

WE SEE a picture of a very young LANGFORD seated before a

microphone with some celebrity.

WE MOVE to a picture of LANGFORD smiling at JACK PAAR.

turns back to LANGFORD who has moved into the living room

LANGFORD is seated on a chair whose back is pressed right

up against the high, ornate brass bedstead at the foot of

the bed. MARSHA trains the gun on LANGFORD now. PUPKIN

is unpacking a suitcase. He takes out a handsome blue suit,

ruffled shirt, a bow tie, black shoes, underwear, socks,

shaving equipment, soap, a hairbrush, a clothesbrush, a

small shoe shine kit, aftershave lotion, deodorant and a

dozen or so rolls of inch-and-a-half wide adhesive tape.

He removes this stuff from a suitcase that is barely big

enough to hold it -- so the mere packing of all this para-

phernalia into such a small space represents something of an

achievement. As he takes the stuff out, he talks to

LANGFORD, his back turned to him.

PUPKIN pauses a moment, then turns to LANGFORD, his voice

filled with emotion.

LANGFORD's eyes shift rapidly.   He is obviously calculating

how to deal with PUPKIN.

MARSHA listens to this exchange a bit nervously.   Gesturing

to her gun, she says:

PUPKIN sees she has lowered it practically to her side.

applauds heartily -- and nobody appears to fill the

spotlight at the edge of the wings. The spotlight holds

There is a pause as PATTEN stifles himself.

One of the PLAINCLOTHESMEN in the back opens the door and

PUPKIN and the other PLAINCLOTHESMAN get out. The unmarked

car has pulled up behind the limo and other PLAINCLOTHESMEN

stand next to it. PUPKIN and the two PLAINCLOTHESMEN start

walking the ten yards or so to the bar-restaurant.

, not like Phil.

The argument between the HALF-STEWED MAN and his WOMAN

continues at the end of the bar. The two FRIENDS have

resumed their intense conversation.

The MOUSY MAN has climbed up on the bar and has turned the

TV back to the late movie. He sits enthralled by a scene

of violence courtesy of Tony Curtis as the Boston

Strangler. PUPKIN looks down the bar at the STEWED COUPLE

to offer them drinks, but they are lost in an argument

over the relative merits of their brothers. PUPKIN turns

to the PLAINCLOTHESMEN.

PUPKIN nods and shrugs.

The PLAINCLOTHESMEN lead PUPKIN out of the bar. The two

FRIENDS are still buried in their intense, private

conversation. The PLAINCLOTHESMEN and PUPKIN walk past

the HALF-STEWED COUPLE.
