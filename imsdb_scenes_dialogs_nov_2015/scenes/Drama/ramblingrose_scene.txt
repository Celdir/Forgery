Rambling Rose - by Calder Willingham

FADE IN:

EXT. DELTA TERMINAL - KENNEDY AIRPORT - DAY

On a taxi arriving at the Delta terminal of Kennedy Airport.

A man in a well-tailored gray suit gets out of the taxi.

CUT TO a CLOSER SHOT of the man as he pays the cabbie. He is

WILLCOX HILLYER, the middle-aged "Buddy" of this story and

the observer through whose eyes it is seen. He has a dry,

ironic, rather agreeable manner and he should seem like

everyone's idea of a successful author, a slightly graying,

trim, still-youthful-looking fifty. The CAMERA follows him as

he walks into the terminal carrying a small travel bag.

INT. DELTA TERMINAL - KENNEDY AIRPORT - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Willcox Hillyer at a counter getting his

ticket processed. A little smile is on his face as he talks

to a pretty airline girl. This character likes girls; his

aloofness is modified, his face changes when he talks to

them. The airline girl smiles back, she finds him attractive.

We don't hear what they are saying, no dialogue on track --

it is obvious he is flirting with the girl in a mild way, but

now a frown comes on his face and he turns his head as if

slightly annoyed by something.

CUT TO a POV shot of a tall, gaunt, almost totally bald man

at the next ticket counter. The man is about sixty-five and

looks like a half senile Great Dane. He is DAVE WILKIE,

erstwhile husband of the heroine of this story. Age has not

been at all kind to Dave; his face is lined with bitterness,

he is a sour, angry, lonely man and now he is making a very

unpleasant scene with a ticket girl and an airline

representative, waving his ticket and gesticulating angrily.

He wears an expensive, ill-fitting suit and a Texas-type hat.

We don't hear his angry complaints, no dialogue is on the

track.

CUT BACK to a CLOSE SHOT of Willcox Hillyer as he stares with

a frown at the man. It's as if he knows the man but can't

place him. The airline ticket girl speaks to him and he turns

back to her, his face softening as he answers her, obviously

saying he'll carry his bag. He nods goodbye to the girl,

turns and the CAMERA follows him as he walks some distance

away and stops, looks back with another pensive frown at the

tall, gaunt man at the next counter.

CUT TO ANOTHER POV shot of Dave Wilkie, a longer shot than

the first. The man is now arguing angrily with two airline

representatives, still waving his ticket and shaking his

head. We don't hear him. Lip-readers might pick up what he is

saying: "I'm supposed to be in first class, not tourist.

What's the matter with this friggin' airline?"

CUT BACK TO Willcox Hillyer, a CLOSE SHOT of his face as he

rubs his chin and frowns obviously struggling to remember the

man. The CAMERA holds on him as he stares at the gaunt angry

Dave, racking his brain. He shakes his head, he cannot place

the man and yet he knows him. The CAMERA moves in closer on

Willcox Hillyer's face as he stares in pensive puzzlement at

this ghost from the past and now we hear, as if from a

distance, FAINT MUSIC on the track -- it is "Dixie," played

with beautiful lazy mocking love by the great Louis Armstrong

in his prime. At first we can barely hear it, then the MUSIC

becomes LOUDER as Hillyer's frown deepens and he seems almost

to know the man.

MAIN TITLE (SUPERIMPOSED): "RAMBLING ROSE"

The MUSIC remains a bit in the distance, but it can be heard.

OTHER TITLES (SUPERIMPOSED): over the following action.

VARIOUS SHOTS, on Willcox Hillyer. He gives up his effort to

recognize the strangely familiar Dave with a little shrug,

turns and walks away with his travel bag.

INT. DELTA TERMINAL - LOUNGE - DAY

We see him entering the departure lounge and boarding the

plane.

INT. DELTA AIRPLANE - DAY

A shot of him as he smiles rather nicely at a very attractive

young stewardess as he walks down the aisle of the plane. He

is not a crass or lewd flirt, but life comes into his face

when he sees a pretty girl -- he seems to have a real

affection for girls: toward men he is polite but rather dry

and ironic, almost aloof, but girls he likes. We see him sit

in a seat, open his travel bag and take out long galley

sheets. He stares for a moment rather wearily at the galleys,

then sighs, puts on reading glasses and begins to make

corrections as boarding passengers walk by in the aisle.

Something or someone disturbs him, he looks up with a slight

frown and CUT TO a POV shot of Dave Wilkie, all wonder and

enthusiasm. This OVER the TITLES and we do not hear the

dialogue they speak, what we heard is LOUIS ARMSTRONG, but I

will put the dialogue in here so the actors can act it. We do

not want to hear it, the sense of what they are saying will

be obvious from the acting.

ANOTHER ANGLE, on them both as Dave blocks the aisle, an

idiot false-toothed grin on his face. Hillyer has a pained

embarrassed smile.

The men shake hands, Dave enthusiastically, Hillyer less so.

We see Dave stow his suitcase and take the seat next to

Hillyer.

EXT. KENNEDY - DAY

CUT TO a shot of a big Delta jet making its final taxiing

turn and ROARING into a take-off.

INT. KENNEDY - DAY

CUT TO a dramatic underbelly shot of the jet going up.

END OF TITLES.

INT. DELTA AIRPLANE - DAY

A shot of the attractive, young stewardess, harried as she

fixes drinks.

INT. DELTA AIRPLANE - DAY

CUT TO Dave and Willcox Hillyer as the young stewardess gives

them drinks. Dave bestows a sour glance on her when he sees

the single drink, but at the moment he is in the midst of an

aggressively self-satisfied conversation and says nothing to

her. He speaks to Hillyer, who is making a real effort to be

polite but is less than happy about the encounter.

Hillyer gives a barely perceptible wince at this speech, but

Dave doesn't notice, he goes on with aggressive self

satisfaction after a swallow of whiskey.

Dave pauses, realizes this might not impress; glances down

with curiosity at the galley sheets, then an unpleasant

smile.

Willcox Hillyer listens with a pained half smile, a hand at

his temple.

Willcox Hillyer half closes his eyes in weariness, but says

nothing. Gently, he rubs his temple. It is plain Dave Wilkie

gives him a headache.

INT. DELTA AIRPLANE

ANOTHER ANGLE, on the pretty young stewardess as she brings

two more drinks. Dave stares sourly at her, wholly unmoved by

her charm.

Willcox smiles apologetically at girl.

The stewardess purses her lips at Dave, who is bowed over his

drink busy opening it. Hillyer lifts an eyebrow at the girl

as if to say, "Don't blame me because of this damned idiot,"

and she half smiles at him.

This is another pointed bitter reference to the unknown

"she." Once again, Willcox Hillyer is deliberately

unresponsive.

Dave Wilkie's eyes narrow with vindictive anger as he says it

and one can well believe the streak of raw violence in the

man. It is frightening even now; he is a clown, but he is a

dangerous clown. As his long, bitter, impassioned tirade

continues, Willcox Hillyer becomes increasingly tense and

pale -- it is obvious he detests what the man is saying and

he is struggling to control himself.

Dave's tone and voice are laconically Southern, but the

hatred and misery in his eyes are raw.

Willcox picks up galley sheets, half turns away.

During this speech, Willcox Hillyer grits his teeth but says

nothing. He keeps his eyes down on the galley sheets. As Dave

shakes his head in sorrow at the state of the nation ..

INT. ATLANTA TERMINAL - HERTZ COUNTER - DAY

A shot of Willcox Hillyer at a Hertz Counter in the Atlanta

airport. A tense, wrought up Dave Wilkie is in the b.g. of

the shot. During the following brief exchange, Hillyer is

politely cool, Wilkie under a great strain.

Hillyer takes rental car papers from a pretty young HERTZ

GIRL, gives the girl a little smile, picks up his travel bag.

In desperation, Dave takes his arm.

Hillyer turns to Dave, puzzled and interested; Dave earnestly

explains.

Willcox Hillyer and the pretty young Hertz Girl stare after

Dave Wilkie as he walks away with spasm-like steps. Hillyer

seems affected, less hostile toward Dave now. He speaks half

to himself, half to the Hertz Girl.

Willcox nods thanks and walks away carrying his travel bag.

EXT. ATLANTA AIRPORT - ROAD - DAY

CUT TO a shot of the red Ford driving from the airport.

EXT. INTERSTATE 75 - DAY

A shot of the red Ford on Interstate 75, Atlanta skyline in

b.g.

EXT. GEORGIA INTERSTATE - DAY

On the red Ford as it speeds along a Georgia Interstate

through red clay hills in green springtime.

INT./EXT. CAR - GEORGIA INTERSTATE - DAY

CUT TO a shot on Willcox Hillyer CLOSE ON his face in the

car. He is lost in reflection. A look of bitter sweet emotion

is on his face, an expression of sadness mixed with

amusement. As the CAMERA holds on his face, we hear again on

the track Louis Armstrong's great version of "DIXIE," or

music of comparable power, beauty and nostalgic evocation.

Now the music is stronger, much stronger than behind the

titles, we are beginning to hear it full force.

BLURRED SCREEN FLASHBACK:

EXT. HILLYER HOME - DAY

A shot of a thirteen-year-old boy on the front porch of a

house in the sleepy Depression South of many years ago. He is

BUDDY, Willcox Hillyer as a boy. The MUSIC continues as he

shades his eyes to look at something far away.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - DRIVEWAY - DAY

CUT TO a LONG POV shot of a young and very pretty blonde girl

walking slowly up an oak-shaded driveway. A ZOOMAR LENSE

takes us TOWARD her. She is carrying a cardboard suitcase

tied with a string. Her clothes are cheap, her shoes are

dusty, runs are in her stockings. She is sweaty, tired and

seems very nervous. ROSE is a very attractive girl, but her

primary quality is not sexiness, but an innocence and

sweetness. She pauses to wipe sweat from her forehead with

the back of her hand and nervously moistens her lips as she

stares ahead uncertainly at the "nice" Southern home which to

her seems very grand. It is apparent she is badly frightened

and apprehensive about what lies ahead. She is also exhausted

from the heat and a long hot walk in the Southern sun. She

blinks at perspiration, swallows in anxiety again and forces

herself to walk on.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - PORCH

CUT TO a shot of Buddy on the porch. Expressionless,

unreadable, neither friendly nor hostile, he stares with an

even gaze directly into the CAMERA. He has his hands on his

hips in a distinctive way that we will later see is a

mannerism of his father's.

Buddy tries to imitate the style of his father, not always

with complete success. Unreadable as a Sphinx, he stands

there, waiting.

EXT. HILLYER HOME PORCH - DAY

CUT TO a POV shot of Rose at the foot of the porch steps. A

tentative little smile is on her face. It is very plain she

is nervous and frightened.

Silence. The damn boy says nothing. A trifle crestfallen,

Rose moistens his lips and swallows. She ventures another

little smile and the CAMERA follows her as she walks up the

steps. The at-times-insufferable Buddy comes into the shot.

He still has his hands on his hips Daddy-style and his

expression is inscrutable, neither friendly nor hostile.

Finally, the boy speaks -- and he is not so bad. He's a child

after all.

A warm and beautiful smile comes on Rose's face and a little

twinkle comes into her eyes. The innocence and sweetness are

not lost, that is never lost, but this is a girl who likes

boys and men.

INT. HILLYER HOME BEDROOM STUDY - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Buddy's mother, Mrs. Hillyer, in a Morris

chair in her bedroom study.

MOTHER is a sensitive, kind and rather appealing if slightly

eccentric lady of about 37 or 38. She wears glasses, has a

Victorian hairdo and a 1930ish style dress. At the moment

Mother is absorbed in her studies -- notebooks and history

books are littered and piled everywhere around her chair. She

is drinking a Coca-Cola and smoking a cigarette held by a

bobbie pin. Calmly, she glances up as Buddy enters the room.

The CAMERA pulls back to include him.

Mother accepts her son's precocious pronouncement as

perfectly normal; talks to him as if he's an adult.

INT. HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM

A shot of Mother, Rose, Buddy, Doll and Waski in the living

room of the Hillyer household. DOLL is a pretty little girl

of about 11, WASKI a boy of 5. Mother's tone is very gentle,

very sweet, very kind. Her unabashed admiration for her own

children has an ingenuousness that is more amusing than

offensive.

Rose has not as yet caught on to Mother's style and is

staring at her with lips apart and blue eyes slightly popped.

Thus, Mother. Slightly cuckoo, a bit out of touch with

reality, but no fool. A very intelligent woman really, and

very, very gentle and kind.

Her style, however, takes a little getting used to and her

long speech throws Rose completely. She stares at Mother in

speechless open-mouthed awe, unable to say a word.

The CAMERA moves in CLOSER on Rose as she moistens her lips,

swallows, tries to talk and can't. She is very, very nervous.

Now she flinches and looks around as we hear a deep masculine

VOICE OVER the shot. It is the voice of DADDY, Mr. Hillyer,

Buddy's father.

ANOTHER ANGLE on Daddy in the doorway of the living room. He

is a handsome man of about forty with a style and a manner

all his own. As extravagant as his remarks often are and

funny though he is at times, the man has a courtly Southern

dignity that is never lost. He is no clown, he is not even a

comedian, he is a man and a formidable man at that: all the

characters in this story love and fear him. We see now where

Buddy got his unreadable expression thing and his hands on

the hips thing. Daddy is unreadable. A straw hat is on the

back of his head, a rolled-up Glenville Tribune is in his

hand, his hands are on his hips. He is staring with what

seems to be stern fierceness at them all, but his attitude

really is inscrutable.

Daddy walks in as Rose stares wide-eyed at him. It is obvious

he scares the absolute bejesus out of her, she looks actually

as if she might faint, her hands trembling on her lap and her

knees quivering beneath her cheap and tacky dress. But she

has a surprise coming. She is soon to lose all her fear of

him, every bit of it. Daddy walks over and sits in a chair

beside her, stares fiercely at her for a moment, then begins

a long speech. Again, extravagant as this speech is, he is no

clown, he is not "being funny," he means every word he says.

Rose can barely answer, eyes fixed in rapt fascination on

him, a half whisper.

Daddy pauses, then in a different tone, his hidden gentleness

and kindness are much more plain; as he talks Rose's eyes

begin to well with tears.

Rose bites her lip, her eyes are filled with tears; an

inaudible whisper.

INT. HILLYER HOME

VARIOUS SHOTS of Rose doing household chores: sweeping the

floor, vacuuming, cooking. She is cheerful in her work,

smiling, good-humored and she works hard. It is obvious she

is happy. We see the children in most of these shots. It is

apparent Rose is a very good worker and very happy in her new

home.

INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

Rose is washing the dishes while the children finish

breakfast. Buddy looks up from this cornflakes with a

slightly sly expression.

Rose turns around, lifts her eyebrows, tosses down the

dishcloth.

Rose turns her back on him.

Rose stares emptily for a moment, then bites her lips

together.

Rose exits and the CAMERA stays on Buddy, Doll and Waski.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - PATIO - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Rose on the stone patio of the Hillyer

house, an attractive area with outdoor furniture and

crabapple tree limbs overhead. Rose is busy sweeping. The

CAMERA PANS to follow her and we pick up Mrs. Hillyer,

Mother. It is a nice day and she is studying out on the

patio, books and notebooks piled around. Rose glances down

curiously at her.

Rose again busily sweeps.

Exit Rose. Mother adjusts her notebook and turns the page of

a history book as she resumes her studies. We hear the sound

of an approaching CAR and she glances up.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - DRIVEWAY - DAY

CUT TO a shot of a slightly worn-out 1932 Model-A Ford as it

rolls up the driveway of the Hillyer home, Daddy at the

wheel.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - PATIO - DAY

ANOTHER ANGLE, on Daddy as he gets out of the Model-A. He has

his usual straw hat on the back of his head. The CAMERA

FOLLOWS him as he walks onto the patio.

Mother doesn't answer, she writes on, head bowed over her

notebook. We see in this shot the hearing aid she wears and

hear from it a faint BUZZ.

INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Buddy in the window of the kitchen. He is

propped on his elbows and listening with keen interest to the

talk on the patio. We hear the VOICES of his parents OVER the

shot.

The CAMERA FOLLOWS Buddy as he draws back into the kitchen.

We see Doll and Waski playing a game on the kitchen table.

Buddy turns, looks back out the window.

EXT. HILLYER SOME - PATIO - DAY

CUT TO Mother and Daddy on the patio. Daddy stands up.

INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Buddy and Doll and Waski in the kitchen.

Doll and Waski are playing parchesi on the kitchen table.

Buddy turns from eavesdropping at the window and strolls

across the kitchen, hands in his khaki pants.

The CAMERA FOLLOWS Buddy as he goes to the hall door,

carefully opens it to make no noise and peers down the hall.

INT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT HALL - DAY

CUT TO a POV shot of Rose busy dusting hall furniture,

humming as she works. We hear on the track the SOUND of the

Model-A starting, and Rose freezes. Then, quickly, Rose

hurries down the hall toward the front door.

ON Buddy as he watches her through a crack in the door. He

has his hands on his hips Daddy-style and his face is

expressionless.

ANOTHER ANGLE, POV of Buddy but CLOSER on Rose at the end of

the hall. She is staring soulfully through the glass of the

front door as we hear the Model-A go down the driveway. Rose

lifts a hand between her breasts, sighs. A lovesick

expression is on her face.

INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

ON Buddy, as he comes back into the kitchen sadly shaking his

head.

INT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

A shot of the family at dinner in the dining room at night.

Daddy is at the head of the table, Mother is at the other

end.

Buddy, Doll and Waski are all seated in neat, nice clothes,

hands washed and hair combed. Rose is serving, but a place is

set for her. She wears an attractive little apron and is

smiling, blushing, happy as Daddy teases and jokes at her.

The CAMERA FOLLOWS Rose as she exits, and STOPS on Buddy and

Doll. Buddy slews his eyes toward his sister, who meets his

gaze for a moment then looks down at her plate. The CAMERA

MOVES on to Mother, who is utterly oblivious of anything

going on between Rose and Daddy.

INT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT (LATER)

ANOTHER ANGLE, on the family as they eat dinner. Rose is

seated at the table now. She is picking lifelessly at her

food and glancing from time to time with a lovesick

expression at Daddy, who is busy eating and seems wholly

unaware of it. Mother also is wholly unaware, but all the

children know what is happening. Rose takes a gravy for a

biscuit and spills a little, her hand is trembling.

INT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT (LATER)

A shot of Daddy alone in the dining room, reading a newspaper

and drinking coffee. Rose comes INTO THE PICTURE, gets dishes

as she clears the table. She stares with a lovesick

expression at Daddy, who is absorbed in paper.

INT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT HALL - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy and Doll tiptoeing down the darkened

hall toward the front door. We hear the MODEL-A going down

the drive. They peer out of the glass of the front door. They

whisper.

INT. HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The CAMERA FOLLOWS them as they tiptoe into the darkened

living room. They go over to the sliding doors and silently

struggle for the best peeping spot. Buddy gets up high, Doll

down low, at the crack in the doors through which light

shines.

INT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a POV shot of the dining room, as seen by children.

Daddy sits absorbed in his paper, oblivious of Rose. She is

staring down at him with a pale look of love.

INT. HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a CLOSE-UP of Buddy and Doll, their heads together.

They whisper.

INT. HILLYER HOME DINING ROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a POV shot of Daddy and Rose, as seen by children. The

table now is cleared and Rose stands half behind Daddy,

staring down at him with a stricken expression.

Rose suddenly makes up her mind, places her hand on his

shoulder, turns sideways, sits down on his lap, puts an arm

around his neck.

For a long time Daddy stares groggily at her with a half

frown as if he can't believe it. In order to stare at her, he

must tilt his head back and, handsome man though he is, he

looks a bit like a startled rooster. Her breasts are pressed

against him, and her eager -pink lips are waiting for a kiss.

Rose breaks down and begins crying, her head on his shoulder.

She has her arms wound tight around him and Daddy seems at a

loss what to do.

INT. HILLYER HOKE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy and Doll. Doll is down near the floor

and can't see as well. They whisper.

Doll tries to rise up and Buddy puts a hand on her head and

shoves her down.

INT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a POV shot of Daddy and Rose, as he struggles to rise

from the chair. They are half falling to the floor and now

they fall, Rose still on his lap. One of her breasts has come

out of her dress, which is very loose and low-cut. She has no

bra, the breast is bare. Daddy is staring groggily at the

breast as if slightly dazed.

INT. HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

CUT BACK TO Buddy and Doll. Buddy is frustrated now.

Buddy groans and peers intently through crack.

INT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

A POV shot of scene as observed by Buddy. He is up too high,

the dining table blocks his view. We see the lower half of

Rose and Daddy. Rose's skirt is up well above her knees.

INT. HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy and Doll.

CUT TO a POV shot of the scene in the dining room.

INT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

DOWN LOW, we can see under the dining room table now. Daddy

has his hands on Rose's shoulders and is firmly pushing her

away.

Rose, on all fours, blonde hair over her face, making little

whimpering noises of dismay:

INT. HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO Buddy and Doll.

Doll forces her way in and they both peep through crack in

door.

INT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a POV shot of Rose and Daddy. Rose stands sheepishly

by the dining room table, half-crying as she adjusts her

dress. Daddy sits in his dining room chair. Daddy is glaring

at her.

INT. HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy and Doll as they peep at the door.

Doll whispers angrily at him.

They continue to peep with interest through the crack in the

doors.

INT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Rose and Daddy. Now Rose is sitting penitent

and crying in one of Daddy's handkerchiefs. Daddy's anger is

gone, he has gotten control of himself and speaks to her now

in a different tone.

He sits beside her, an arm around her shoulders in a fatherly

way.

INT. HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO Buddy and Doll in the darkened living room. He

gestures that they'd better leave, and they do. The CAMERA

FOLLOWS them as they tiptoe out of the living room.

INT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT STAIRS - NIGHT

ANOTHER ANGLE, on Buddy and Doll as they tiptoe up the front

stairs.

INT. HILLYER HOME - TOP OF STAIRS - NIGHT

ON Buddy and Doll at the top of the stairs. They pause to

talk and now they don't have to whisper. Doll is happy,

pleased.

Doll gives him a venomous glance and walks away. The CAMERA

STAYS on Buddy as he stares after her with a thin little

smile. Be seems wryly amused that he has made her angry.

After a moment, he turns and stares in the direction of

downstairs and his face changes. His smile fades, then slowly

returns as he thinks of what has happened.

It is obvious that secretly Buddy admires very much his

father's behavior.

INT. HILLYER HOME BUDDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

A shot of Buddy at night in his small bedroom.

He wears a rather skimpy old-fashioned nightshirt that comes

midway between his hips and knees. At the moment he is

finishing brushing his teeth at the bureau, using an old

fashioned water pitcher and bowl. The CAMERA FOLLOWS as he

walks across the room in the light of the lamp by his bed. He

looks around cautiously, then picks up the mattress of his

bed. He pushes it far back and we see springs. He takes out a

small "book" or pamphlet and stares gravely at it.

CLOSE-UP: The front cover of the pamphlet. We see the overall

title: LITTLE DIRTY COMIC BOOKS. And beneath it: BLONDIE AND

DAGWOOD. And beneath that, in smaller letters: "Mr. Dithers

Comes to Dinner -- and How!" We see Buddy's hands in the

shot, and he opens the pamphlet and we catch enough of a

glimpse of the thing to know it is pretty awful -- a drawing

maybe of "Blondie" stark naked with a finger in her mouth

going, "Tee-Hee!"

ON Buddy, as he stares down with grave intentness at the

Little Dirty Comic Book. Slyly now, he retraces his steps to

the bureau and takes out a flashlight. He goes back to the

bed, switches off the lamp, gets in the bed and turns on the

flashlight and pulls the covers over his head. We hear a

faint SOUND on the track and Buddy suddenly yanks back the

covers, puts the flashlight on the table by the bed and

throws the Little Dirty Comic Book under the bed. He lies on

pillow and pretends he's asleep, and we hear the door of his

room OPEN and a CREAKING on the floor.

ANOTHER ANGLE, on a weepy Rose in a very thin nightgown. The

shot is FROM BELOW as Buddy might see her as she stands over

his bed. She looks very lonely and unhappy and is half

crying.

ANOTHER ANGLE, on both of them. Buddy stares at her in

surprise. It is dim in the room, but we can see them in the

moonlight.

ANOTHER ANGLE, on Rose and Buddy in the bed in the moonlight.

It is all innocent enough, Buddy is a child and Rose

obviously has no lewd intent in getting into his bed. She

lies back on a pillow staring up at the ceiling and smoking a

cigarette.

ANOTHER ANGLE, on Rose and Buddy in the bed. Buddy has

propped on an elbow and is staring down at her breasts in the

moonlight -- we see the soft notch between her breasts in the

open V of her thin nightgown. She is completely unself

conscious with him.

Before she can answer, he touches her breast with his finger

through her nightgown.

Puts his hand in her nightgown.

Takes his wrist.

INT. HILLYER HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Mother's bedroom-study in the moonlight. We

see Daddy lying wide-awake in a single bed staring broodingly

out into space. Mother lies asleep in a big four poster in

the background of the shot. Daddy sighs wearily to himself in

the grip of "insomnia in reverse."

INT. HILLYER HOME - BUDDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT BACK to Buddy and Rose in bed. He has evidently sweet

talked her into letting him fiddle with her; his hand is- in

her nightgown. There is no indication of lewd interest on

Rose's part, a peeved and exasperated look is on her face.

Buddy seems quite fascinated, however.

Can't quite say it; leans over and whispers in her ear and we

don't hear what he says.

INT. HILLYER HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Daddy sitting on the edge of his bed in

pajamas. He looks frowzle-haired and glum. The CAMERA FOLLOWS

him as he wearily gets up and walks across the bedroom in the

moonlight and takes a package of cigarettes from a bureau. Be

glances over his shoulder as we hear Mother.

Daddy lights a cigarette and walks to the window and stares

out at the moonlit night.

The CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSER on his face and we see a weariness

and strain he has not shown before.

INT. HILLYER HOME - BUDDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

A shot close on Rose and Buddy in bed. Evidently Rose has

weakened and is allowing him to fiddle with her, but we can

only surmise this, the shot is on their heads and shoulders

and a cloud has crossed the moon, the light is more dim. A

different look is on her face, a solemn expression as if she

is listening to some far away sound that she finds strangely

haunting. She moistens her lips, speaks in a slightly feeble

voice.

The hand falls limply from Rose's eyes and she turns her head

to the side and closes her eyes. Helplessly, she lies there

as the boy fiddles with her.

INT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT HALL - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Daddy walking down the downstairs hall in a

bathrobe and slippers. He looks very frowzled and sleepy.

INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

ON Daddy as he walks into the kitchen, turns on the light. He

goes to the ice box, an old-fashioned type made of wood that

takes cakes of ice. Be pours out a glass of milk.

INT. HILLYER ROME - BUDDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a very CLOSE SHOT on Rose's face. The light is dim but

we see perspiration on her forehead. Her breathing is not

normal. Her eyes are shut tight, her teeth are clenched.

CUT TO a shot CLOSE on Buddy. We do not see what he is doing,

but evidently he is fiddling with her. He seems quite

interested in the proceedings.

INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Daddy in the kitchen as he sits rather

gloomily at the kitchen table drinking the glass Of milk.

INT. HILLYER HOME - BUDDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot close on Rose ai Buddy in the bed. The shot is

of their heads and shoulders.

She has an arm very tight around his shoulders and her eyes

are shut tight. The moment of truth is at hand.

INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Daddy as he washes out the glass in the

sink.

INT. HILLYER HOME - BUDDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Rose and Buddy in the bed. The extremity of

her crime has dawned on Rose and she is sitting up in the bed

with a look of horror on her face. Buddy is staring worriedly

at her.

ANOTHER ANGLE, on Rose and Buddy as Rose in a panic gets out

of the bed, pulls down her thin nightgown and tiptoes toward

the door. She stops and looks back as a chilling thought

occurs to her.

INT. HILLYER SOME - UPSTAIRS HALL AND DOWNSTAIRS HALL

CUT TO a shot of Daddy walking down the downstairs hall in

his bathrobe. The shot is down the staircase and Rose in the

upstairs hall tiptoes into the picture. A floorboard creaks

and he looks up and sees her.

ANOTHER ANGLE on Rose in the upstairs hall. Fortunately for

her the light is dim. Her knees are shaking beneath the

nightgown, she looks as if she might faint.

The CAMERA FOLLOWS her as she goes on shaky legs down the

hall.

INT. HILLYER HOME - ROSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Rose as she enters her small bedroom.

Feebly, as if totally exhausted, she shuts the door behind

her then leans against a bureau and states into its mirror.

The horror of her own criminality has overwhelmed her. With

trembling hands, she takes a cigarette from her half empty

pack and finds a wooden kitchen match on the bureau.

Her hands tremble visibly as she strikes the match. She has

not turned on the light in her room and her considerable

charms are very apparent in the orange glow of the match.

Burning match in her fingers, she stares at her own

reflection in the bureau mirror, transfixed by a horrible

realization.

INT. HILLYER HOME - DREAM - CELLAR

QUICK DISSOLVE TO BLURRED SCREEN: the border of the screen is

blurred, we are obviously seeing a nightmare fantasy. The

shot is of an eager, excited, diabolically mischievous Buddy

and an astonished, awed DOLL. They are in some far dark

recess of the cellar of the house and the scene is furtive,

murky, cobwebby.

ANOTHER ANGLE on Buddy from below with candlelight giving his

child's face a sinister look. Now he has "Dracula" teeth and

evil arched eyebrows.

INT. HILLYER HOME - ROSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Rose standing horrified before the mirror.

The match is still burning in her fingers.

INT. HILLYER HOME - MASTER BEDROOM/STUDY

her. The border of the screen is blurred, it is another flash

of fantasy.

Mother stares in consternation at Doll.

INT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

A shot of Daddy and Rose on the front porch of the house. The

scene is murky, dark, gloomy night and the weather is bad.

Daddy has his arm rigidly thrust outward as he points down

the driveway. A weeping, slumped Rose sadly walks down the

steps carrying her cardboard suitcase. Fantasy.

INT. HILLYER HOME - ROSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT BACK to Rose standing before the mirror, sick with

horror. A feeble whimper-like groan comes from her.

ANOTHER ANGLE on Rose as she turns from the bureau and stares

off into space, a very badly frightened girl. Half-crying,

she speaks to herself.

INT. HILLYER HOME - BUDDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy half asleep in bed. The light of the

lamp by his bed goes on and he sleepily opens his eyes. The

CAMERA COMES BACK and we see Rose in her nightgown standing

by his bedside. She is very pale and tears are on her cheeks.

Rose bows her head and begins crying into her hands.

CUT TO a CLOSE SHOT of Buddy. We hear the soft sound of Rose

weeping over the shot. Buddy is affected, his flinty child's

heart has been touched, but he is not quite ready to admit it

yet. He is struggling with himself, trying to remain "cool"

and not show his emotion. He frowns, moistens his lips,

swallows. With seeming coolness, very much as in the scene

with Doll in which he deprecated Daddy's stand at

Thermopylae, he shrugs.

The CAMERA PULLS BACK to include Rose. She is staring at the

boy with hopeless despair.

Too much for Buddy, he loses his "cool." He swallows and

blinks as if he might cry, then sits erect in the bed and

squares his shoulders and assumes a stern expression Daddy

style.

INT. HILLYER HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Daddy, lying in bed and staring up

sleeplessly at the ceiling. Insomnia in reverse has got him.

CUT TO a shot of Rose and Buddy. Rose is sitting on the bed

beside him and she has dried her tears and got herself in

hand.

INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

A shot of a coolly angry Mother in the kitchen. It is late

morning. As she talks the CAMERA PULLS BACK to show a

sheepish Buddy standing "on the carpet before her. The other

children, Doll and Waski, are seated at the kitchen table

having hamburgers for lunch. They are happily smiling with

schadenfreude amusement at their brother's discomfiture.

As she talks, Buddy reluctantly gets a bottle of castor oil

and a tablespoon from a shelf and brings it to her. A smiling

Doll comes forward and hands Buddy half of an orange. He

makes a face at her. Mother takes the bottle and pours out a

tablespoon of castor oil.

CUT TO a shot of Rose in the doorway of the kitchen. She is

quite an apparition. She wears bright red lipstick, pink

rouge on her cheeks, mascara and her hair is coiffed up in

some outlandish manner, but her clothes are the most

remarkable thing of all.

The skirt is of strange, pink, semi-shiny and very thin

material and has about a dozen tiny little flowers that could

be rosebuds sewed on it. It fits extremely snugly to say the

least. The blouse seems a composite: it has frilly white

sleeves that are opaque and otherwise is made of filmy white

material that is hardly opaque at all. She has no bra and her

breasts are half visible, the nipples denting the material.

It is pretty wild for 1935. She seems to have on no underwear

of any kind; the skirt, which clings to her like a bathing

suit, shows no panty seams. She is carrying a shiny black

patent leather pocketbook and has on high heel black patent

leather shoes and no stockings. An ingenuous little smile is

on her face.

Rose walks in, "modeling" the outfit and the CAMERA PICKS UP

Mother.

We hear the SOUND of the Model A on the driveway.

We hear the PORCH DOOR SLAM. Smiling, happy, Rose glances

around. We hear the SOUND of the kitchen door opening.

CUT TO a POV SHOT of Daddy in the kitchen doorway. As usual,

he has a rolled-up Glenville Tribune in his hand and a Straw

hat on the back of his head.His hands are on his hips and he

is hunched forward as if he cannot believe what he sees.

ON THEM ALL. Rose is smiling, happy to be the center of

attention.

Daddy walks slowly into the kitchen shaking his head. Sits at

table.

Daddy is staring with a very dubious frown at Rose's skirt.

He slowly shakes his head.

Points to little buttons on right side of the skirt.

Points to buttons on left side.

Happy to oblige, Rose turns around. Her plump, round,

feminine behind is only too plainly revealed through the thin

material. Daddy slowly shakes his head.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - PATIO - DAY

and at a study table listening with cheap earphones to a

homemade crystal radio set. Enter a rather somber-faced Doll

The CAMERA REMAINS on Rose as she rolls her eyes upward in

dismay.

INT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - DAY

A shot of the family at breakfast in the dining room. The

silence is deafening. Everyone looks depressed except Daddy,

who is aloofly calm. Rose's head is bowed meekly over her

plate as we hear the CLATTER of silverware. Finally, Daddy

speaks in an almost pleasant tone.

-- The word means "an animal epidemic," and it's a pet word

of Daddy's; he pronounces it epi-zoo-tics, not epi-zoo-ot

tics, and uses it to mean any outrageous human malady --

The word is hongry, not hungry.

INT. DENTIST'S WAITING ROOM - DAY

him. The CAMERA STAYS on Buddy.

INT. HOTEL - DAY

a fat man, is on the other side of Daddy.

her dress is torn. A little innocent, frightened smile is on

her face. The CAMERA PANS to include Daddy and the Chief of

Police.

irony:

better go. Daddy beckons to the children and they start to

leave, all looking depressed.

on pillows and wearing a rather attractive pink silk

housecoat of Mother's.

see a sewing machine and evidences of dressmaking. Rose has

on a new and modest little dress that Mother evidently has

made for her.

Rose casually pulls the dress over her head and stands there

in panties and bra, oblivious of Buddy and the children. She

has about as much modesty as a small child herself.

INT. GARAGE - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Daddy and Buddy back in the garage. They are

scrutinizing a wooden ladder that hangs on pegs alongside the

garage. All Daddy needs is a cap and a pipe to be a dead

ringer for Sherlock Holmes. He is in dead earnest about this,

it is no Joke and he does not dream of being funny.

Buddy stares at him in apprehension.

Buddy sits quickly up in bed, at once pushes back the covers

and gets out of the bed, hurriedly reaches for his khaki

pants.

INT. HILLYER HOME - UPSTAIRS HALL - DAY

dressed and is banging angrily on Rose's door.

frightened Doll in her nightgown in the b.g. down the hall, a

hand to her mouth. Daddy commences kicking at the door.

Finally, the CLICK of a bolt and slowly the door opens. We

see a wide-eyed, terrified Rose. She has a sheet around her

and evidently nothing more.

INT. HILLYER HOME - ROSE'S BEDROOM - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Daddy in the bedroom. He yanks open the

closet door, looks under the bed as he talks.

In her distress and dismay, the sheet has come down over

Rose's shoulder and one of her breasts is exposed.

The CAMERA follows Daddy as he strides angrily toward the

window and leans out of it and stares down. Rose makes a

little whimpering sound.

EXT. HILLYER SOME - GARDEN - DAWN

CUT TO a POV shot of the garden below as seen by Daddy from

the window. We see lying on the ground BILLY, the Sulky Boy

who scared Mother. He wears only undershorts and is groaning,

holding his leg, which evidently he has injured in jumping

from the window.

INT. HILLYER HOME - ROSE'S BEDROOM - DAWN

On Daddy, as he turns from the window to Rose.

Daddy gently pulls the sheet around her to cover her breasts.

drinking coffee in the early morning. Daddy looks grave,

Mother looks sad, and Rose is crying into a handkerchief.

INT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - DAY

A shot of the family at breakfast in the dining room. The

dissolve suggests that some time has gone by. Daddy looks a

bit grim, Rose has a wan and depressed expression. Mother

looks worried.

Rose rises and he watches her leave, then turns to Mother.

Rose returns with coffee and pours it out for Daddy.

Daddy watches Rose exit to the kitchen, then leans forward

and speaks to Mother, his expression a bit sly.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - DRIVEWAY AND PATIO - DAY

A shot of the Model A coming up the driveway of the Hillyer

House. It is late afternoon.

triumphant little smile on his face.

A shot of Daddy as he walks onto the patio, a rolled-up copy

of the Glenville Tribune in his hand and his straw hat on the

back of his head. He definitely has a triumphant expression.

Buddy on the patio notices it.

interest, eyes wide.

INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN

CUT TO a shot CLOSE on Daddy. He is peering intently at Rose.

CLOSE ON Rose, as she turns, weeping.

On them all. Daddy and Mother stare in shock at Rose.

Buddy ducks down out of eight instantly. Both Mother and

Daddy, however, are too preoccupied and upset to be concerned

with him.

Rose stands up.

Rose lifts her dress and Daddy leans forward eagerly to

confirm his belief. Rose stands there with her skirt lifted.

She has on a pair of skimpy white panties. An unmistakable,

definite protrusion can be seen in the area below her navel

just above the line of her panties. A stupefied look is on

Daddy's face.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - PATIO - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Doll walking up onto the patio with

schoolbooks. The CAMERA follows her as she walks over to

Buddy, who is crouched down eavesdropping at another window.

She whispers to him.

INT. DR. MARTINSON'S HOME OFFICE WAITING ROOM - NIGHT

terror on his shoulder.

INT. DR. MARTINSON'S SOME OFFICE - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Dr. Martinson's private office in his home,

quite a bit more luxurious than his office at the hospital. A

sober-looking Mother and Daddy sit talking to him. He almost

seems to relish the situation.

Oddly enough, in the stress of the situation, Daddy now seems

almost friendly to Dr. Martinson, whom previously he

considered a polecat.

INT. DR. MARTINSON'S HOME OFFICE WAITING ROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Buddy and Rose in the waiting room. He is

helping her lie on the couch on pillows as she weeps, a hand

over her face.

INT. DR. MARTINSON'S HOME OFFICE - NIGHT

CUT TO a CLOSE shot of Dr. Martinson. An expression of

distaste is on his face. The CAMERA pulls back as he talks to

Mother and Daddy.

A long, frozen pause as both Daddy and Dr. Martinson stare at

Mother in surprise. She stares at the Doctor with fire in her

eyes. He seems already to shrink a little. Finally she speaks

with a calm fury.

Dr. Martinson stares at her in fear and shock, intimidated by

the calm fury and ice-cold moral indignation.

He opens his mouth as if to speak, but no sound comes out.

Mother turns to Daddy.

Both Mother and Daddy totally ignore him. Mother's eyes are

fixed on Daddy and he is struggling with himself, staring

down at the floor.

Daddy finally looks up at Mother and admits his error like a

man.

Mother turns from Daddy and walks up to the desk and stares

down at Dr. Martinson as if he is a loathesome bug upon which

she intends to step.

EXT. STREET BY HOSPITAL - DAY

A shot of the Model A parked on the street outside a hospital

in a small Southern town. We see Daddy slowly pacing back and

forth in front of the hospital entrance, his head bowed and

his hands clasped behind him.

ANOTHER ANGLE, CLOSER on the Model A. Buddy sits in the

middle on the front seat, Mother is at the window. Doll and

Waski are on the back seat. They all are staring with pale

worry at the pacing Daddy fifty feet away. All are

frightened, Mother is very pale. Doll has a tiny handkerchief

to her eyes and is half crying. Even Waski is very scared.

CUT TO a shot of Daddy from the POV of the car. He looks at

his wristwatch, frowns and walks into the entrance of the

hospital.

silent. Doll sniffles in her handkerchief.

CUT TO a POV shot of Daddy as he slowly walks up to the car,

his straw hat in his hand.

CUT TO a shot of Mother CLOSE on her face as she stares at

her husband as if trying to read the news on his face. A tiny

frown comes on her forehead as icy fear comes in her eyes.

ANOTHER ANGLE, CLOSE on Daddy as he walks up to the window of

the car, hat in hand. A trace of tears can be seen in his

eyes, but when he speaks his voice is calm.

ANOTHER ANGLE on Daddy and them all. In pale fear, mother

stares at him, uncertain what has happened.

As mother sighs in heartfelt relief...

INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

A shot of Daddy sitting with mother at the kitchen table.

Bright cheerful sunshine comes in the window that opens on

the patio. Rose comes into the SHOT carrying a coffee pot, a

sunny smile on her face.

Daddy pauses, seems to be struggling with himself, he is

frowning.

Daddy stops beside her, puts an arm around her shoulders and

with weary irony.

Daddy wearily picks up his straw hat from the kitchen counter

and walks out of the kitchen on the patio, as the CAMERA

stays on Rose and mother.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - PATIO - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Buddy on the patio. He has eight or nine

gourds on an outdoor table and is cutting round holes in them

smiles at him.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - GARDEN

CUT TO a shot of Rose and Buddy on a beautiful summer day

walking in the garden behind the Hillyer house. They walk up

from the rabbit hutch.

HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM NIGHT

room.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - DRIVEWAY

CUT TO a shot of a 1930's automobile in the Hillyer driveway

at night as it drives up and stops before the front steps.

ANOTHER ANGLE, CLOSE on Rose and Dave Wilkie in the car. Here

DAVE is much YOUNGER, of course, and a rather handsome man in

a stolid way. Even though he is younger than when we saw him

on the plane, he is quite a bit older than Rose. Rose's eyes

are opened wide, she is a bit breathless, obviously something

important has happened. Dave stares at her as if fascinated,

almost as if awed.

INT. HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

CUT TO a shot of Daddy peering out of the window of the

living room.

VARIOUS SHOTS of a wedding in a tiny country church. We see

shots of Rose in a white wedding dress, smiling, happy. Dave

is stiff and solemn in his best suit. Daddy gravely gives

Rose away. We hear no dialogue here, MUSIC on track. We see

Mother, Buddy, Doll and Waski in the front row, all in Sunday

best and very solemn. We see a CLOSE SHOT of Rose's knees

trembling beneath her white wedding dress as a country

minister marries them. VARIOUS SHOTS of a rather idyllic

country wedding in a very plain, unpretentious country

church, and...

EXT. CHURCH - DAY

A shot of Rose, Dave, Buddy, Doll and Waski at a picnic

celebration outside the church by a running brook.

The scene should be beautiful in summertime. We see a

barbecue pit, homemade ice cream in the metal can, other

picnic things. A happy Rose is kissing first Buddy, then

Doll, then Waski. Dave smiles fondly, but rather stiffly at

her.

CUT TO a shot CLOSE on Buddy as he stares pensively at Dave.

The CAMERA stays on him as we hear VOICES OVER. Rose is

happy, Dave phlegmatic.

The CAMERA stays on Buddy, as he stares pensively at Dave. He

has no expression on his face at all.

EXT. CHURCH - DAY

A shot of Rose and Dave bidding goodbye to the Hillyers.

Daddy, Mother, Buddy, Doll and Waski are in the model A. Rose

is obviously on the verge of tears as Dave speaks solemnly to

Daddy.

Daddy starts the Model A.

ANOTHER ANGLE on Rose as she weeps and waves the

handkerchief.

INT./EXT. MODEL A - STREET - DAY

A shot of Daddy and Mother in the Model A as Daddy drives. We

see Doll and Waski solemn on the back seat, but Buddy is not

visible.

Mother pauses, frowning, she has her doubts, looks over her

shoulder.

Mother frowns in surprise.

CUT TO a POV shot of Buddy on the back seat of the car. Now

it is clear why we couldn't see him in the other shot. Be is

lying down on the seat of the car with his Sunday coat pulled

over his head.

ANOTHER ANGLE on Mother and Buddy, Doll, Waski. Buddy lies on

the seat, motionless with his coat over his head.

CUT TO ANOTHER ANGLE on Mother, from the front as she slowly

turns back and stares thoughtfully ahead. The shot is also on

Daddy. They both stare ahead in pensive silence. Finally

Mother speaks.

END OF FLASHBACK

INT./EXT. HERTZ CAR ON INTERSTATE - DAY

ON Willcox Hillyer behind the wheel of the Hertz car. He is

is on his face.

Willcox slowly shakes his head.

EXT. HERTZ CAR - INTERSTATE EXIT - DAY

CUT TO a shot of the red Ford as it takes a turn-off from an

Interstate.

EXT. HERTZ CAR - BUSTLING CITY - DAY

CUT TO a shot of the red Ford as it drives into a rather

bustling little Southern city that does not look at all like

the "Glenville" we have seen. A lot of traffic, new roads,

filling stations, prosperity. It could be Rome, Georgia as it

is today.

EXT. CAR PAST HOLIDAY INN - DAY

ANOTHER SHOT of the red Ford going past a modern Holiday Inn

in the city.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - DRIVEWAY - DAY

ON the red Ford as it turns into a familiar driveway, that of

the old Hillyer home.

But insofar as possible it looks different now, like a relic

from the past.

Maybe the house needs painting, the garden is in weeds -- the

place is not exactly dilapidated, but it is marked by time.

A SHOT of Willcox Hillyer as he gets out of the red Ford and

walks up the familiar steps of the front porch, travel bag in

hand.

INT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT HALL - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Willcox Hillyer as he glances into the

living room. The room looks the same but different -it is

musty, dim.

Willcox Hillyer stares at it as if haunted a bit, turns and

the CAMERA follows him as he crosses the hall and looks into

Mother's old bedroom-study. This room is quite different. The

four poster is gone. The room is dusty, musty, dark.

Magazines are on the floor in a ring around Mother's old

study chair. We see "male" things. It is apparent Daddy lives

alone in this room.

A SHOT of Willcox Hillyer as he walks down the familiar hall

back to the kitchen.

INT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

He looks around. No one is there. He glances at a modern

refrigerator that is in pretty poor shape, glances with a

frown at dishes in the sink unwashed. He goes on out to the

patio.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - PATIO - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Daddy putting out seed for birds on a table

a stern frown as Willcox Hillyer comes out on the patio.

Daddy takes him by the arm, leads him back into the kitchen.

EXT. HILLYER HOME - PATIO - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Willcox Hillyer and Daddy as they walk with

their drinks out to the patio.

ANOTHER ANGLE on Willcox Hillyer and the aged Daddy as they

sit on the patio sipping whisky. Willcox Hillyer is not

disturbed or worried about Rose, Daddy has been very casual

and offhand about it and he has no inkling of what the news

really is.

Willcox Hillyer rises with his drink in hand and walks across

the patio to the kitchen door.

INT. HILLYER HOME KITCHEN - DAY

CUT TO a shot of Willcox Hillyer as he goes into the kitchen.

He picks up the whisky bottle and pours himself a very large

drink.

in the kitchen, a sunny smile on her face as she pours coffee

for Daddy. A very quick moment, only a few seconds.

A CLOSE SHOT OF WILLCOX HILLYER

in the kitchen, drink in hand, a look of grief on his face.

He struggles to control himself, puts a hand over his eyes,

then pulls himself together, turns from the kitchen.

SHOT OF THE PATIO

ON Willcox Hillyer and Daddy as the former walks up with his

refreshed drink and sits down. He is in control now, his face

is expressionless and he is seemingly calm.

Daddy pauses, in trouble emotionally, but gets a grip on

himself and in an almost dispassionate manner; but powerful

feeling is behind his words.

CUT TO a CLOSE SHOT of Willcox Hillyer. Despite his efforts

to control himself, tears are in his eyes. He clenches his

teeth, takes a big swallow of his drink.

ANOTHER ANGLE on them both as Daddy rises.

SHOT OF WILLCOX HILLYER AND DADDY

as they walk toward the red rental Ford. Daddy uses a cane.

He is a very old man. Willcox Hillyer looks in pain, he

grimaces as they walk along.

driveway.

in the car. Daddy is staring fiercely ahead, Willcox Hillyer

stares ahead in gloom.

SHOT OF THE RED FORD

as it pulls up in front of the Holiday Inn we have already

seen.

SHOT ON DADDY AND WILLCOX HILLYER

in the car. Willcox Hillyer sits there staring off into space

in deep gloom. Daddy eyes him and now relents. We see

sympathy in his face.

CUT TO a shot of Daddy and Buddy, now middle-aged Willcox

Hillyer, as they walk toward the entrance of the Holiday Inn.

MUSIC.
