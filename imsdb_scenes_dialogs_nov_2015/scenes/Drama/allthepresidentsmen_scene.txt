Start with as few credits as possible. When they're over--

FADE IN ON:

A TINY BLACK PIECE OF TAPE.

We see it in the center of the large, dimly lit screen. As

the tape is pressed around a door--

BEGIN THE BREAK-IN SEQUENCE.

It's a major piece of action, running maybe five minutes and

it's all as detailed and accurate as we can make it, with as

many "if only's" included as possible. ("If only" the tape

had been attached up and down instead of around the door,

Wills wouldn't have spotted it and alerted the police; "if

only" the first police car called had gone to investigate,

Baldwin, watching from the Howard Johnson Motor Inn, would

have seen their uniforms and radioed Hunt and Liddy in time

for them to have gotten to the five burglars and then safely

away.)

The break-in ends when Leeper arrests the five men. He thought

he only had one guy, so when ten hands were raised he was

surprised. The hands are all encased in Playtex rubber

surgical gloves. HOLD on the hands a moment; then--

A DARK APARTMENT.

The phone rings. WOODWARD fumbles for the receiver, turns on

the bed light. He listens a moment.

He lies back. The apartment is one room, a small terrace

beyond. Not much of a place.

WOODWARD lies still, staring at the ceiling. He blinks, blinks

again. HOLD...

THE ENORMOUS FIFTH FLOOR OF THE WASHINGTON POST.

It looks, early of a Saturday morning, pretty deserted. Those

reporters that are around are young, bright, and presently

involved in nothing more taxing than drinking coffee and

thumbing through the papers.

HARRY ROSENFELD surveys the scene from his office doorway as

WOODWARD approaches, hangs his coat at his desk, not far

from where ROSENFELD is standing.

THE CRIMINAL COURTS BUILDING.

WOODWARD hurries along, goes inside as we

A CORRIDOR INSIDE. WOODWARD comes down it, looks around,

sees a door marked "Counsel's Offices" and heads toward it.

Now--

A CLERK AT A DESK as WOODWARD comes up. Behind them, two

lawyers are clearly angry about something, talking and

gesticulating to each other.

THE COURTROOM and business is booming. Muggers, pimp, hookers,

their families and friends. In the scene that follows, a

constant counterpoint is what's going on up at the front as

an endless succession of petty criminals caught the previous

night, the aforementioned muggers, pimps, and hookers, are

shuttled in, given a quick appearance before a JUDGE who

sets bond, and then shuttled out.

In the audience, one man stands out--DOUGLAS CADDY. He is

extremely well-dressed and obviously successful. Beside him

sits another smaller man, who is unshaven and squints.

WOODWARD moves in, sits alongside CADDY.

He takes out a small notebook, writes, muttering aloud as he

does.

And as he gets up, walks off--

THE WATER FOUNTAIN IN THE CORRIDOR. There is a small line.

CADDY waits at the end of it.

CADDY turns away; WOODWARD goes right on.

Without a word, CADDY turns, leaves the line without getting

a drink. Silently, WOODWARD watches. Now--

CADDY seated as before beside RAFFERTY. WOODWARD's voice

come from behind him, and as CADDY turns, WOODWARD is seated

one row back.

CADDY looks at WOODWARD, turns back.

WOODWARD considers this a moment. Then--

And on that word--

THE COURTROOM as without warning, it quiets. There is suddenly

a tremendous air of expectancy, you can feel it. Now we see

why as five men in dark business suits are led in; they've

been stripped of belts, ties, and shoelaces. McCord is taller

than the others. They stand, facing the JUDGE, backs to the

audience.

WOODWARD sits watching as the proceedings start, but it's

hard to hear. He concentrates as the JUDGE starts speaking.

The five men do not move or reply. Then, after a long pause,

Barker says--

WOODWARD starts moving forward now, down an aisle, moving

past kids and whores and all the rest, trying to hear what

the hell's going on. At the front of the spectator's section

is a fence-like wooden barricade about three feet high. As

he approaches it--

The JUDGE indicates the bald burglar.

WOODWARD at the bench is leaning forward, trying to hear but

it's hard.

And on these words,

CLOSE UP--WOODWARD leaning over the fence practically falling

over it in a desperate straining effort to catch what's going

on.

Now from the courtroom--

THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF WASHINGTON POSTS.

We are at the end of the press run, the papers are all

assembled and being cabled and sent off by machine to various

places. As the papers continue to roll past--

A UNION TYPE EMPLOYEE grabs a paper, looks at the front page.

The Watergate story, headlined whatever it was headlined, is

visible. The byline was by Alfred E. Lewis. The union type

Post employee glances at the article--

And he turns happily to the sports section--

A CLOSE UP OF HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS.

It's new money and looks as if it's been recently ironed.

Someone is going through the cash, making a quick count.

During this--

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

We're in a room in a police station and two men are present.

One, a COP, is nervous as hell and constantly aware of the

door. The other, BACHINSKI, is taking hurried notes in a

reporter's type notebook as he examines the evidence.

THE ADDRESS BOOK. Beside the name "Howard E. Hunt" is the

notation "W.House." Now, BACHINSKI hurriedly opens the other

book to the letter "H" and there is the same name, "Howard

E. Hunt" and beside it, the letters, "W.H."

We HOLD on the HUNT name, and the address notations. Then--

WOODWARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT.

The phone rings, waking him. He fumbles for the phone and

the light, finally gets them both.

A BOX OF MAALOX TABLETS.

ROSENFELD is opening them, we're in his office, WOODWARD

sits across the desk, holding the notebook we saw him writing

in.

HOWARD SIMONS sticks his head in the office.

He moves on. ROSENFELD turns quickly to WOODWARD.

Now--

A MOON-FACED MAN RINGING A TRIANGLE.

THE NEWSROOM as the triangle sound echoes.

HOWARD SIMONS leaves large Managing Editor's office, walks

past another office, knocks twice on the glass wall.

Inside the Executive Editor's office, BEN BRADLEE sits. As

SIMONS knocks, he turns, nods. He appears, for the moment,

deep in thought.

HARRY ROSENFELD on the opposite end of the room hurries out

of his office, following a bunch of editors, all of them

heading across the huge room. As he passes WOODWARD's desk

ROSENFELD pauses.

WOODWARD continues to rub his neck as ROSENFELD hurries off,

all the editors still moving toward the place where the moon-

faced man intermittently rings the triangle.

WOODWARD picks up the sheet of yellow paper from his desk.

Lined, legal-sized, it is crammed with names and numbers and

addresses. They are in no neat order; looking at them it's

almost like following a path; chicken tracks in ink. WOODWARD

mutters "to hell with it" and reaches for a thick book, flips

it open.

NOW WE SEE THE BOOK: It's the Washington Phone Directory and

we're in the W's. As WOODWARD's finger stops, we can see

he's looking at the White HOuse entry number. There it is,

just like your name and mine. Listed.

Now WOODWARD starts to dial, visibly nervous, a fact he tries

very hard to keep out of his voice tone.

Throughout the following call, we stay on WOODWARD's face,

hear the other voices.

WOODWARD is delighted he's even there.

And he's about to hang up, when--

And he's about to hang up again when--

He hangs up, sits there. His hands are a little twitchy...

HOLD. Now--

ROSENFELD hurrying (he always hurries) toward his office.

WOODWARD, looking for something in his desk throughout this

scene, speaks to him.

WOODWARD, unfazed by anything, continues to open drawers,

close them, as ROSENFELD rolls on.

WOODWARD nods, heads back toward the files as we

WOODWARD AT HIS DESK dialing the phone.

He's got the Colson file spread out now, and we see pictures

of the man and articles the Post had done on him. But

basically what we see is WOODWARD plugging away on the goddamn

phone and you'd think his finger would fall off from all the

dialing and you know his voice is tiring as this montage

goes on, you can hear it grow raspy. But a lot of what a

reporter does he does on the phone, and that's what we're

compressing here. The dialing never stops, the voices are

continuous.

And he bangs the phone down sharply--

--more dialing SOUNDS. Now snatches of conversation--

More dialing. Then--

Dialing again. WOODWARD's voice is showing genuine fatigue.

There is the SOUND of the phone being slammed down in his

ear. Hard. Now--

ROSENFELD AND SIMONS approaching WOODWARD who is working at

his desk. He has put in a lot of hours on this and looks it.

He looks up at them.

WOODWARD TYPING LIKE MAD, makes a mistake, corrects it, types

on muttering to himself, and--

ROSENFELD IN HIS OFFICE munching a handful of Maalox tablets

and--

WOODWARD taking a sheet from his typewriter, hurrying off

and--

ROSENFELD taking the sheet from WOODWARD--

ROSENFELD nods, shows him out and--

WOODWARD BACK AT HIS MACHINE typing faster then before, makes

another mistake, starts to correct it, glances around and--

ROSENFELD IN HIS OFFICE gesturing to somebody but not WOODWARD

and--

WOODWARD watching as BERNSTEIN appears in view from behind

the wide pillar by WOODWARD's desk, heads toward ROSENFELD's

office. WOODWARD shrugs, goes back to his typing, makes a

typo immediately, glances over toward ROSENFELD's office,

freezes as we--

ROSENFELD handing some papers to BERNSTEIN. They look, from

this distance, suspiciously like WOODWARD's story.

BERNSTEIN hurrying out of ROSENFELD's office, and--

WOODWARD watching BERNSTEIN until he disappears out of sight

behind the pillar. WOODWARD hesitates, finally goes back to

his typing, makes another mistake, fixes it, makes still

another, his temper is shortly to make itself known--

ROSENFELD as WOODWARD hands him another sheet of paper.

ROSENFELD NODS, takes it, immediately starts to read as we--

WOODWARD AT HIS DESK watching as ROSENFELD gestures again.

There is a pause. Then BERNSTEIN appears from behind the

pillar and--

ROSENFELD handing BERNSTEIN another sheet of paper. BERSTEIN

nods, takes it, walks back toward his desk, disappears behind

the pillar again. WOODWARD is starting to steam. Now--

BERNSTEIN AT HIS DESK typing magnificently, his hands rising

and falling like Rubinstein's. Behind him is the pillar and

for a moment there is nothing--then, very slowly, a figure

peers out from behind the pillar--it is WOODWARD.

He watches. BERNSTEIN continues to type, then after a moment,

rests, thinks, shifts around in his chair and as his glance

starts toward the pillar--

THE PILLAR. WOODWARD is gone.

BERNSTEIN typing madly away.

THE PILLAR. WOODWARD is visible again, eyes very bright...

now--

BERNSTEIN finishing typing, his hands moving majestically.

WOODWARD comes up behind him, stands looking a second.

Then--

BERNSTEIN nods, grabs the papers both that he's been typing

and that he's been copying from.

And as he rises--

WOODWARD AND BERNSTEIN walking silently out of the newsroom

then turning left down a darker corridor, passing bulletin

boards and wall lockers and it's all nice and quiet as they

amble on, nodding to the few people they pass on their way

and after a while they turn right and enter the coffee lounge

which is empty; the walls are lined with Norman Rockwell

reproductions and various kinds of vending machines are

visible, selling coffee or milk or fruit or sandwiches and

there are some plastic tables and chairs and the minute they

are alone, the silence ends.

And as WOODWARD glances at the two stories--

BERNSTEIN watching. Now--

WOODWARD. He glances from one story to the other. Then,

disconsolately--

And he sinks down in a chair.

WOODWARD nods.

And as he goes, leaving WOODWARD just sitting there--

BERSTEIN, re-entering the newsroom, returning to his desk.

He starts to insert some papers into his typewriter,

hesitates, lights a cigarette. He inhales, as, behind him,

WOODWARD briefly is visible going to his desk behind the

pillar.

Finally BERNSTEIN inserts the paper, starts to type as

And as he rolls forward again, out of sight--

RICHARD NIXON ON THE TUBE.

(It's the June 22 Press Conference.) He talks on about

something, it doesn't matter exactly what here, the point

is, it should include that strange smile of his that kept

appearing when the man should not have been smiling. Hints

of pressure maybe, that's all, and once it's established--

PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

WOODWARD sitting alone, gloomily staring at the set. We're

in the Post Cafeteria, it's the next morning, and the place

is pretty much empty. He sips the coffee, it tastes rotten.

BERNSTEIN moves up behind him, carrying a cup of coffee of

his own. He stands by WOODWARD briefly.

WOODWARD, BERNSTEIN, AND NIXON. The way it's shot, it's almost

as if they're watching each other; NIXON staring out from

the TV set, answering questions. WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN sip

coffee. We don't know yet--or better, they don't know it

yet, but these are our adversaries.

WOODWARD AND BERNSTEIN, without NIXON now. They sit at the

table. Occasionally, NIXON is audible in the background.

NIXON ON THE TUBE. Serious now.

WOODWARD AND BERNSTEIN staring at the set thinking...

WOODWARD AND BERNSTEIN walking toward BERSTEIN'S desk.

The reporter KEN RINGLE at the next desk watches them a

moment. Then--

As BERNSTEIN grabs for the phone--

A SECRETARIAL POOL IN A LARGE OFFICE.

BERNSTEIN is talking off to one side with an attractive girl.

And as she goes on, quickly--

THE NEWSROOM.

BERNSTEIN is at his desk, telephoning. WOODWARD stands

alongside.

We hear the other end of this phone call clearly.

SOUND of the phone being laid down.

There is the SOUND of the phone being dropped into its cradle.

BERNSTEIN continues to hold his. He and WOODWARD just look

at each other. Now--

THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS.

Now, as WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN get out of a cab, start inside--

A MALE LIBRARIAN IN HIS OFFICE.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN standing there. The nod. One of them

maybe says "yessir," the other maybe "please." The LIBRARIAN

moves out of his office into a corridor. They go with him.

No one else is around. The LIBRARIAN looks at them, quickly--

And just like that, he's back into his office, and as he

shuts the door--

WOODWARD AND BERNSTEIN walking along through the Library of

Congress.

On the word "face"--

A BEARDED YOUNG-LOOKING CLERK. We're in the reading room of

the library, and WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN are with him.

Now--

WOODWARD AND BERNSTEIN seated at a table with from anywhere

between 10 to 20 thousand slips of paper. In front of them,

seated at a high desk, the bearded clerk looks down on them,

shaking his head. It's a staggering amount of work to thumb

through.

Now we have a series of shots of the two of them going through

the slips; it took them hours and hours, and the afternoon

darkened as they worked. And they're tired. Now--

WOODWARD AND BERNSTEIN getting back into a cab.

As the taxi pulls off--

ROSENFELD

reading an article by BERNSTEIN's desk. WOODWARD sits on an

adjacent desk.

Suddenly he gestures and we--

BRADLEE STANDING ACROSS THE ROOM. Without a nod, he moves

toward ROSENFELD.

WOODWARD AND BERNSTEIN, nervously watching BRADLEE come. As

soon as BRADLEE is within earshot, ROSENFELD starts his sell.

BRADLEE by this time has taken the story, grabbed an

unoccupied chair, sat down, started to read. His only response

to ROSENFELD is an intermittent "uh-huh, uh-huh."

WOODWARD AND BERNSTEIN, watching as the silence goes on.

ROSENFELD too. He wants the story too, but he doesn't want

it like WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN do. They were, as they said,

proud of their work. The silence goes on. Finally BRADLEE

looks up.

He begins editing the piece, slashing paragraphs out of it.

Other reporters are watching now. BRADLEE is impatient, as

always.

WOODWARD doesn't know. BRADLEE continues to hack at their

piece. Done, he stands, walks away.

WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN watch him go, they are embarrassed,

angry, crushed. HOLD on their faces. Then--

WOODWARD'S APARTMENT - MORNING

He is in pajamas and lugging a flower pot out to the balcony,

positioning it so it would be visible to anyone passing in

the alley below. He takes a stick with a red flag, jams it

into the flower pot. He's nervous and he makes several

adjustments, making sure the red flag is secure and won't

fall.

WOODWARD down in the alley, staring up at his apartment. The

flag is clearly visible. It's early. He checks his watch,

hurries out of the alley.

THE CITY ROOM - NIGHT

Deserted except for a few older Front Page types, reporters

whose legs have given out, playing cards in a corner of the

room. WOODWARD is working at his desk until he glances up at

a wall clock. It's almost one on the button and as he rises--

WOODWARD racing down the stairway of the Post; as he hits

the lobby, he turns and we

OUTSIDE THE POST - NIGHT

WOODWARD appears in the side exit, walks off. When he gets

out of sight of the paper, he starts to run. Now--

WOODWARD turning a corner, running on. Up ahead is a cab--

WOODWARD IN THE CAB sitting forward tensely. Occasionally,

various monuments are briefly visible, lit up in the b.g.

WOODWARD takes out some money as we

THE CAB stopping. WOODWARD pays, gets out. The cab pulls

away. When it is out of sight, WOODWARD starts to run again.

A STREET as WOODWARD runs by. It's not the nicest area in

the world. He is going faster now.

A CAB GASSING UP AT A STATION. WOODWARD hurries to it, gets

in and--

THE SECOND CAB roaring along some Washington streets.

WOODWARD INSIDE THE CAB. He looks at his watch, tries not to

seem nervous. But his fingers are drumming, drumming and--

THE SECOND CAB stopping, as WOODWARD gets out, pays. The cab

starts off, but slowly. WOODWARD waits. The cab doesn't turn

as the first one did. WOODWARD still waits. Finally the cab

turns and the second it does, WOODWARD starts to run again

and--

WOODWARD turning a corner, running on and--

ANOTHER CORNER as WOODWARD turns it, finally stops and catches

his breath as we--

A GIGANTIC UNDERGROUND TYPE GARAGE

WOODWARD ENTERING THE GARAGE. It's an eerie place, and his

heels make noise and if you wonder is he edgy, yes he's edgy.

He comes to the ramp leading down to lower levels, hesitates.

THE RAMP. It seems to descend forever.

WOODWARD starting down. HOLD on him as he walks. Down he

goes, the shadows deepening, then disappearing, then covering

him again. He continues on. He must be at least at the first

underground level now but he doesn't stop, and we don't stop

watching him as he continues to go down, turning, the SOUND

of his shoes softer now and he's a smaller figure as we watch

him circle around and around until we--

ANOTHER LEVEL UNDERGROUND. Dimly lit. A few cars parked here

and there. WOODWARD hesitates on the ramp, looks around.

THE GARAGE. Dark, dark, eerie.

WOODWARD quietly stepping off the ramp, continuing to glance

this way, that way. Now--

TWO CARS PARKED BESIDE EACH OTHER.

Nothing unusual about that. But then some cigarette smoke

appears, trailing up and disappearing from between the cars.

As WOODWARD moves forward--

A MAN SITTING ON HIS HAUNCHES BETWEEN THE CARS, smoking. He

leans with his back against the wall.

DEEP THROAT shakes his head, walks off. WOODWARD stands alone

now, watching. Now the shadows have the other man. Just his

footsteps are audible. WOODWARD stands there... HOLD.

BERNSTEIN.

It's morning and he's struggling to get his bike down the

steps of his apartment building.

WOODWARD driving up in his two-year-old red Karmann Ghia. He

roars up alongside BERNSTEIN, waving a folded-up newspaper.

The Times spread somewhat tentatively over a mailbox. A small

headline is visible, with the words "Barker," "Liddy," and

"Telephone" in some kind of order. WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN

look at it the best they can.

As BERNSTEIN nods--

A LITTLE CITY PARK.

A guy shells peanuts. BERNSTEIN hurries up.

IRWIN looks at BERNSTEIN for a long time. then--

He walks off, doesn't look back. Now--

ROSENFELD

at the water fountain on the 5th floor. He chews up a few

Maalox tablets, notices BERNSTEIN steaming up.

ROSENFELD heads for his office, BERNSTEIN pursuing.

He enters his office, BERNSTEIN follows.

And he looks unsympathetically at BERNSTEIN--

SIMONS circling around the 5th floor. ROSENFELD falls into

step. They keep moving throughout.

BERNSTEIN'S APARTMENT.

A shambles. He is busy doing two things at once, studying

notebooks and packing. Music plays, lovely stuff; the Bach

Brandenburgs. As the phone rings--

And as he stands there--

AN ATTRACTIVE, EFFICIENT-LOOKING WOMAN of BERNSTEIN's age.

She has just entered the apartment. Vivaldi is playing now.

He smiles, gently begins massaging her shoulders as she

studies his finances.

He indicates a mound of papers. She pulls it out as he

continues to massage her, more sensually now. She reaches

back, puts her hand on his.

HANNAH looks at BERNSTEIN a moment; then she smiles gently,

shakes her head.

And quickly from that--

BERNSTEIN

seated perspiring on a hard bench in a stifling office.

Outside: palm trees; we're in Miami. And judging from the

number of cigarette butts strewn around the bench, BERNSTEIN's

been there a while. Waiting. Nervous. And maybe he never

will be able to get it together, who knows.

At the front, a SECRETARY sits filing her nails. Behind her

are a number of closed doors to offices. No one passes without

her OK. The clock hits three in the afternoon as BERNSTEIN

gets up from the bench, goes to the SECRETARY.

THE BENCH as BERNSTEIN slumps back down. He wipes his forehead

with his sleeve, smokes a fresh cigarette, is kind of

interested when a UNIFORMED COP walks up to the SECRETARY,

who is now putting red polish on her nails.

She nods.

BERNSTEIN watching as the cop walks past the SECRETARY, enters

an office behind.

THE CLOCK ON THE WALL. IT'S QUARTER OF FOUR NOW.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

BERNSTEIN, approaching the SECRETARY again. She is working

on her right hand now.

ANOTHER UNIFORMED COP walking by the SECRETARY's desk.

He enters the same office the first COP did.

BERNSTEIN. He lights another cigarette, puts it out, then

lights another.

THE SECRETARY

finishing her manicure. It is almost five o'clock now.

BERNSTEIN, his bench a sea of cigarette butts, slowly gets

up and goes to the SECRETARY.

He walks out the double doors.

BERNSTEIN IN HALLWAY. He looks down the hall. At the end,

opposite the SECRETARY's reception room, is a big glass door

with a sign reading: Office of the Dade County Clerk.

BERNSTEIN goes into a phone booth in the corridor from which

he can see both offices. He puts in a dime, and dials.

SECRETARY. The phone RINGS and she punches the button on the

phone console.

BERNSTEIN in phone booth.

He hangs up.

BERNSTEIN watching from phone booth as the SECRETARY hurries

across the hallway. As we see her open the door of the clerk's

office, BERNSTEIN bolts out of the phone booth and runs into

the reception room heading straight for the SECRETARY's desk.

BERNSTEIN at her desk, looking at the telephone console,

receiver in hand. He punches the button marked Intercom and

we can hear it BUZZ somewhere.

DARDIS emerging through one of the doors behind BERNSTEIN.

BERNSTEIN see him.

DARDIS' OFFICE. He is fiddling with a combination lock at a

filing cabinet. BERNSTEIN is seated across DARDIS' desk.

He hands BERNSTEIN some papers, glances at his watch.

BERNSTEIN continues to fly through the papers.

And as it's mentioned--

CLOSE UP--CASHIER'S CHECK. It's drawn on the First Bank and

Trust Company of Boca Raton, Florida, it's dated April 10

and it's for 25 thousand dollars, payable to the order to

Kenneth H. Dahlberg.

BERNSTEIN starting to copy the check in a meticulous

facsimile. DARDIS watches.

And from here quickly--

BERNSTEIN IN A PHONE BOOTH in the lobby of the Justice

Building. Wildly excited--

And now comes

THE HUNT FOR DAHLBERG.

This is a compressed montage sequence in which we CUT from

one reporter to the other, both of them desperately trying

to locate a man names DAHLBERG.

WOODWARD is maybe in the reference room of the Post, sweating,

surrounded by Who's Who and Dictionary of American Biographies

and phone books from dozens and dozens of cities--

BERNSTEIN is maybe in the phone booth of the Justice Building,

sweating, with a pile of dimes as he dials away.

This took them hours, and that effort should be visible to

us. They tire, grow punchy, but they keep on, checking phone

book and dialing numbers and God knows what else. The point

is, we want to get to DAHLBERG in a reasonably short amount

of time, but we also want people to know there was effort

involved.

WOODWARD, bleary, in the reference room, a girl comes in, a

researcher librarian type.

And now she drops a piece of paper, a photo--

As she leaves--

The photo.

It is a picture of Hubert Humphrey standing next to another

man. The caption identifies that other man as KENNETH

DAHLBERG. Now--

WOODWARD AT HIS DESK.

The room is reasonably quiet. ROSENFELD is visible in his

office. As WOODWARD picks up the phone, gets Minneapolis

information--

ROSENFELD'S PHONE RINGING. He hurries in, grabs it.

BERNSTEIN, drenched. There are no dimes left. He listens a

moment more, then nods, hangs up, leans back against the

glass, takes a deep breath, closes his eyes as we

WOODWARD on the phone.

WOODWARD's lips are going "tell me, tell me."

AN ARTICLE WITH WOODWARD'S NAME ON THE BYLINE.

ROSENFELD holds it.

He starts off.

WOODWARD takes the story, scrawls BERNSTEIN's name in front

of his on the byline. ROSENFELD watches. As WOODWARD finishes,

he takes the story again, hurries off. Now--

THE HEADLINE OF THEIR STORY:

"Campaign Funds Found in Watergate Burglar's Account."

Now--

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

that it isn't exactly a gigantic headline piece. As a matter

of fact, as more and more of page one appears, we see that

their story is tucked away at the bottom and as bigger and

bigger headlines are visible--

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

--the whole first page. Plastered across the top in giant

letters is the following: "EAGLETON RESIGNS." And as you

look at the whole page now, you can barely make out the tiny

piddling Watergate story. The point is abundantly clear:

nobody cared a whole lot.

THE TRIANGLE

being rung like crazy. And as it SOUNDS--

THE BUDGET MEETING

The foreign editor, an enormously thoughtful-looking and

respected man, indicates "no."

As the men rise and head for the door, the FOREIGN EDITOR

moves toward BRADLEE and SIMONS who remain seated as before.

BRADLEE and SIMONS say nothing. They respect this guy.

He leaves. BRADLEE and SIMONS stay where they are, both of

them flattened by what the guy's said. Because they're not

sure he's wrong... HOLD. Now--

THE PAPERS POURING OUT OF THE ASSEMBLY LINE.

We're back with the UNION GUY from before. He pulls out a

paper again, looks at a story on the front page--

THE WOODWARD/BERNSTEIN STORY that said the GAO found that

CREEP has mishandled over $500,000 in campaign funds.

As he turns to the sports section--

GETTING THE CREEP LIST SEQUENCE.

Either they get it as it is now, or as they really did, from

a Post researcher who knew someone. In ant case, we see the

list, with the columns of names and numbers meaning offices

and phone extensions.

We also see the two of them working, first, making long

attempts at figuring out who worked for whom at CREEP.

Then, once they have that, they begin using the cross-

reference phone books, which are not familiar to moviegoers.

And from these, they begin to get the home addresses of the

various small-fry people who work for CREEP.

Near the end alphabetically, there is a common female name,

Jane Smith or something like that. As BERNSTEIN runs his

finger down the addresses, something strikes him as familiar,

and as he reaches for the phone--

A CRUMMY-LOOKING BAR - MID-DAY.

BERNSTEIN enters, looks around, then smiles and moves to a

lovely girl with a sweet face who probably weighs 200 pounds.

She is sitting alone in a corner booth. She nods to BERNSTEIN,

can't quite pull off a smile.

HOLD on her frightened face a moment. Then--

BERNSTEIN

riding home on his bicycle. He gets to his building, starts

lugging it up when--

JANE IN THE DARKNESS. If she was scared earlier, it's panic-

time now. She turns, hurries off.

BERNSTEIN watches her. Suddenly a SOUND comes from the

darkness behind him. He whirls. It was nothing but from the

way he jumped when it happened you can tell the fear is

spreading.

Now from Washington, in darkness--

ESSEX HOUSE IN MANHATTAN - BRIGHT SUNSHINE.

WOODWARD comes hurrying along, and as he enters the hotel--

A DESK CLERK shaking his head at WOODWARD.

And as he goes--

WOODWARD out on the street, in a phone booth near Essex House.

WOODWARD waits anxiously as the connection is made.

And the phone clicks dead--

AN ELEVATOR, the numbers of the floors being lit as it rises.

4--5--6-- WOODWARD stands alone in the elevator. As it reaches

seven and the doors slide open, he steps out and

THE MARRIOTT SUITE. It's numbered 710. WOODWARD approaches

but as he does the door begins to open so he whirls, knocks

on the door nearest him. Now 710 is wide open and several

maids leave, watched by a large black man.

WOODWARD waits by his door as 710 slowly closes. The maids

look at him a moment. He knocks again, louder.

The maids nod, move out of sight. WOODWARD stands tense and

still, watching the closed door numbered 710... Now--

NATIONAL AIRPORT IN D.C. - LATE AFTERNOON.

People are getting off the shuttle, WOODWARD among them.

BERNSTEIN waits.

They look at each other, neither has a clue. HOLD. Now--

THE RED KARMANN GHIA

moving along a residential area in Washington. It's later

that night.

INSIDE THE CAR - NIGHT. WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN driving along.

WOODWARD nods.

As WOODWARD turns left.

And on those words--

A DEAD END SIGN. We hear BERNSTEIN explaining--

Now on those words--

ANOTHER DEAD END SIGN.

WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN pulled over to one side. BERNSTEIN,

baffled, stares around; WOODWARD looks at a map with the aid

of a flashlight.

WOODWARD goes back to his map. BERNSTEIN continues to smoke,

staring around at the night.

WOODWARD - AT THE FRONT OF A HOUSE. A sweet old lady is

looking out at him.

ANOTHER LADY - IN HER DOORWAY. This time both WOODWARD and

BERNSTEIN are there.

CLOSE UP - MISS ABBOTT

And from nowhere, suddenly she bursts into tears.

WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN as her door slams in their faces.

They just look at each other, bewildered. And a little bit

upset; their upset increases as the rejections go on.

WHOLE SERIES OF FACES

in quick succession--they're all in various doorways, men,

women, young, old. The only thing in common is their fear.

And as he closes the door

And as her door starts to shut

And as he almost starts to beg

She stands there, shaking her head back and forth, back and

forth, pathetic and sad. Now--

WOODWARD.

He is seated alone staring at his coffee cup, surrounded by

junk food debris. We are in a Hot Shoppe, it's night, and as

BERNSTEIN comes up with food, they're dressed differently

from before. BERNSTEIN puts more junk food and coffee down.

BERNSTEIN passes over some food. They both look bleary and

in foul moods. Silently, they start to eat, something they

continue doing throughout. They're not hungry, they just

eat.

The continue to eat, bleary and numb, as we

A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN--

--kind of an honest, hard-working face.

WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN are standing in her doorway.

She doesn't talk at first, but she doesn't slam the door

either.

And now she starts, at last, to talk, and they expect it to

be their first breakthrough, but when it turns out to be the

most withering onslaught yet, they are stunned.

And she slams the door--

WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN, slowly walking back in silence back

to the car.

They continue to walk; slowly.

A MIDDLE-AGED MAN--IN HIS DOORWAY

WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN, staring at the man.

The middle-aged man looks at him.

BERNSTEIN stares at him in silence as we--

ANOTHER SERIES OF CREEP EMPLOYEES.

Only they aren't slamming doors, they're sitting in various

rooms of their houses and apartments. We don't see the

reporters or hear their questions but the answers they receive

make it self-evident. We start with the middle-aged man seen

above.

Smiles, talks on as we--

RICHARD NIXON'S SOMBER VISAGE.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

BERNSTEIN and WOODWARD in a crummy cafeteria, watching the

evening news on the TV set high on the wall. WOODWARD eats a

hamburger, BERNSTEIN smokes, sips coffee. It is night, as

usual now.

NIXON--on the tube.

WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN as the news commentator come on, begins

introducing another story.

He gives WOODWARD a big smile. WOODWARD eats his hamburger

in silence...

A DIFFERENT TIME, A DIFFERENT PLACE--EARLY EVENING.

BERNSTEIN gets out of his car, walks up, and knocks on the

door of a small tract house in the D.C. suburbs. A woman

opens the door.

And we--

THE BOOKKEEPER approaching the door. She's younger than the

cliche version of a bookkeeper. As she looks at her sister--

The sister is smoking and there is a pack on the dinette

table.

As the sister starts for the pack--

And he crosses ten feet inside the front door.

He goes into the living room area, picks up a book of matches.

This whole scene moves slowly, the tension building under it--

it's not like news people talking, nothing overlaps here.

BERNSTEIN lights the cigarette.

As the BOOKKEEPER winces.

He is by a couch.

The BOOKKEEPER kneads her hands together silently. BERNSTEIN

watches.

He takes out his notebook.

The BOOKKEEPER. And she does want to talk. But the notebook

scares her terribly and she can only stare at it.

There is a pause. Then--

And now, as long last, she begins to cry. HOLD on her tears,

then--

A TYPEWRITER

clicking away. The words "INTERVIEW WITH X. SEPT. 14" are

visible. There is music in the background, really blasting

away, Rachmaninoff or worse.

We are in WOODWARD's apartment and BERNSTEIN is dictating

notes from the BOOKKEEPER interview. It's very late, and

BERNSTEIN has notes on everything, matchboxes, and it's hard

for him to read. They're both really excited, BERNSTEIN from

his coffee jag, WOODWARD by what BERNSTEIN's dictating.

The noise blasts away as BERNSTEIN and WOODWARD hunch over

the typewriter. It's a moment of genuine exhilaration.

Paranoid, sure, but for the first time, they're really on to

something; it's all starting to split open...

WOODWARD AND BERNSTEIN

They are driving through McLean, Virginia, a development of

identical imitation Tudor houses.

As they drive on--

A PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN standing in the doorway of one of the

Tudor houses. She is very pregnant. She knows instinctively

who they are, and she dominates them in a genuinely proud

female way. What I mean is, it's her scene, and they're

suddenly embarrassed to be bothering her.

She studies them still; more silence.

They nod, start back down the walk. She watches them.

They turn, look back at her.

CLOSE UP--MRS. SLOAN

WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN watching her. She seems like a terrific

girl. And maybe they've upset her. Or maybe what she has

said, coming from her, has more impact than otherwise.

Quietly, they turn back, walk in silence toward the red

Karmann Ghia...

THE McLEAN McDONALD'S--DINNERTIME. Lots of very noisy, happy

children. WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN sit surrounded by their

usual array of junk food.

They continue to sip coffee; outside it continues to rain.

Now--

A YOUNG, SLENDER GUY answering his door.

WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN stand outside, their jackets over

their heads, protecting themselves from the rain which is

harder now.

It has begun to rain even harder.

A CHRISTMAS CARD from the Nixons, they are standing in front

of the White House Christmas tree. It is signed "To Hugh and

Debbie Sloan, with thanks, Richard M. Nixon, Patricia Nixon."

PULL BACK

and we're in the living room. More coffee is being drunk;

SLOAN endlessly stirs his.

WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN wait as SLOAN is clearly going through

a struggle with himself. Then--

SLOAN stirs his coffee.

SLOAN is shocked at the mention of Kalmbach.

WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN just look at each other--they hadn't

known it, not remotely. SLOAN stands and as they head for

the door--

THE THREE OF THEM heading across the foyer.

BERNSTEIN and WOODWARD looking very uncomfortable as SLOAN

goes on.

SLOAN opens the front door. WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN pause,

nod, almost an embarrassed pause. Then as they hurry out

into the rain--

A NERFBALL

flying toward a basket cupped to a picture window. When we

PULL BACK

we're in BRADLEE's office, SIMONS and ROSENFELD are also

there, along with WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN. BRADLEE plays

nerfball mostly; he hasn't got the worlds's longest attention

span.

And all this now goes fast--

As WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN leave the office--

BERNSTEIN AT HIS DESK ON THE PHONE. He has some papers in

front of him an a notepad and pencil in his free hand. He is

tired and very, very nervous. It is dark outside. In what

follows, BERNSTEIN takes notes.

There is a BUZZING SOUND. Then--

And he hangs up.

BRADLEE and BERNSTEIN at BERNSTEIN's desk. BRADLEE is going

over BERNSTEIN's notes.

And now suddenly--

THE PRESSES OF THE POST

rolling the story. They're modern and gigantic and

WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN. They're in the lobby of the Post at

night and through a thick-pane of glass they're watching

their story roll and on their faces is something you don't

expect to see: panic.

BRADLEE comes up behind them, looks down at the presses,

starts to talk.

They all watch the presses now.

THE PRESSES continuing to roll. The SOUND is incredible. Now--

A TELETYPE MACHINE

clacking away like crazy. We can read the words, "The Senator

finished by saying that although he was..." and from there--

A SENATOR and while the words "although he was" are still

very fresh in our minds--

The SOUND of the teletype doesn't stop in this little part

and we see three people and it's very important that their

voices are immediately recognizable and distinct. One, the

SENATOR is from the West and will have that twang. The next

two whom we are about to meet are PUBLIC RELATIONS PEOPLE

from CREEP and the WHITE HOUSE. The CREEP voice is very

southern, the WHITE HOUSE GUY sounds like an NBC announcer.

The WESTERN SENATOR will be seen in a corridor of the Senate

office building, talking to reporters, the CREEP P.R.

SOUTHERNER will be talking to reporters in front of the CREEP

office doors and so identified. The WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN

will be standing on a platform with a flag visible off to

one side. As the teletype goes on--

THE SOUTHERN CREEP P.R. MAN

THE WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN

BRADLEE'S OFFICE

A lot of activity. BRADLEE is at his desk reading the teletype

dispatches. SIMONS and ROSENFELD are there, WOODWARD and

BERNSTEIN, too. A kid comes in with more teletype stuff. The

editors look at it.

THE UNION GUYS IN THE POST

looking at a new headline:

NIXON ELECTION AIDES CONCEALED FACTS FROM GOVERNMENT PROBERS

They start for the sports section, only this time, they stop,

go back, stare at the headline again. From them watching--

SIMONS

walking WOODWARD to the elevators.

The elevator opens. WOODWARD shakes his head "no" and steps

inside as we

MRS. GRAHAM in her office as a SECRETARY lets WOODWARD in.

He's nervous. She's standing by the window, he crosses to

her.

She nods. There's a pause. He waits. She's trying to say

something, get something started, but it's difficult. Silence.

She stares out again, quietly starts to talk.

WOODWARD caught between a rock and a hard place. He is silent

until there is the SOUND of light laughter and we--

MRS. GRAHAM. The laughter came from her.

WOODWARD tries not to exhale too audibly.

CLOSE UP--MRS. GRAHAM as abruptly she reaches out, touches

WOODWARD on the arm.

WOODWARD makes a nod. HOLD. Then--

BRADLEE

in a state of anger, pacing around the tiny teletype room.

WOODWARD hurries in.

BRADLEE says nothing, just points to the AP teletype. WOODWARD

looks at it, clearly is upset.

And he stalks out. WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN stand staring at

the teletype which keeps on clacking and clacking as the

L.A. Times story keeps getting longer.

As BERNSTEIN nods, takes off out of the room--

THE UNION GUYS

studying the front page, on which one headline indicates

that they're named the guys at CREEP who got the reports.

A HOT SHOPPE.

WOODWARD is stirring his morning coffee as BERNSTEIN comes

in, spots him, hurries over. BERNSTEIN is maybe more excited

then we've yet seen him.

Now, from the two of them--

A MAZE OF CREDIT CARD RECEIPTS IN VARIOUS PILES.

There is the SOUND of bad guitar music, which as we

PULL BACK

we see is BERNSTEIN playing. We are in his apartment, it's

night, and the two of them, bleary, are studying the maze of

receipts.

He switches to another song which sounds a lot like the one

he just finished playing.

THE CREDIT CARDS. The camera moves across the travels of

Donald Segretti. There is the SOUND of BERNSTEIN's guitar.

HOLD for a moment, then--

TINY, BABY-FACED MAN

standing in his doorway.

BERNSTEIN--OUTSIDE THE APARTMENT DOOR. We are, it will soon

be clear, in California now, Marina Del Rey.

SEGRETTI shrugs, and as they enter his apartment--

INSIDE. They walk across to a small terrace outside, where

they sit. The terrace has a glorious view of the water and

lots of girls in bathing costume, below.

He waits; SEGRETTI just shakes his head.

SEGRETTI shakes his head, stares out at the girls.

BERNSTEIN says nothing, waits.

CLOSE UP--SEGRETTI staring at the girls and the blue water.

HOLD on the question, then--

WOODWARD AND BERNSTEIN

back in D.C., walking through the airport.

As they continue on--

WOODWARD

alone in the underground garage. Tense, jumpy. He looks at

his watch, paces around. It's all eerie as hell. Then, from

the ramps, footsteps.

DEEP THROAT moving out of the shadows, smoking, as always.

He stops as suddenly DEEP THROAT dives down behind the nearest

car.

WOODWARD dropping beside him.

And as he points

THE SHADOWS BY THE RAMP. You can't see a goddamn thing. But

there is the SOUND, faint but distinct, of breathing.

WOODWARD standing, staring into the darkness. He is scared,

wipes his mouth. He doesn't move for a moment. Then he walks

directly into the darkness and as he's gone--

A HORRID FACE IN CLOSE UP, red eyed, unshaven, beaten--there

are half-formed scabs and cuts. He is leaning against a wall,

shivering. He looks, for all the world, like a perpetual

drunk.

WOODWARD in the shadows, coming closer.

THE DRUNK. He blinks slowly, tongue lolling outside his mouth.

He watches WOODWARD approach.

WOODWARD coming still closer.

THE DRUNK. He blinks very slowly now. Maybe he isn't even

certain WOODWARD's there.

WOODWARD stopping in front of the drunk. They look at each

other for a long time. Then:

THE DRUNK. Nothing, no reaction.

WOODWARD studying the other man.

THE DRUNK. And he blinks again, then slowly, shivering, begins

sliding down the wall. WOODWARD reaches for him, holds him

up.

WOODWARD managing to get out his wallet, take out some bills.

He starts up the ramp with the drunk, and as they disappear

up the ramp out of sight, he gives the drunk the money.

DEEP THROAT pacing and smoking. He is visibly upset; scared

maybe. He glances over as WOODWARD comes back down the ramp

alone.

And from this tone, you know HALDEMAN scares him.

DEEP THROAT

SILENCE in the garage. HOLD... then--

THE FIFTH FLOOR OF THE POST

and it's noisy. Not as noisy as it's going to get, but there

is more tension around just now than there has been

previously.

AN ATTRACTIVE WOMAN IN HER MID-30s. On her desk is her name,

MARILYN BERGER. She is watching BERNSTEIN who is standing by

the water cooler nearby. As she gets up--

BERNSTEIN drinking water.

As she speaks--

WOODWARD working at his desk, suddenly looking up as a SCREAM

comes from the direction of the water cooler and as everyone

turns to see, here comes BERNSTEIN dragging BERGER over to

WOODWARD's desk.

And now from her--

WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN in a corner of the room, talking low

and fast.

A FROZEN SHOT OF MUSKIE IN THE SNOW in tears, standing on

the flat-bed truck. This was in the New Hampshire primary,

just after the Canuck letter was published.

WOODWARD ON THE PHONE

There is a sound of him hanging up the phone. Hard. WOODWARD

hangs up quietly, rubs his eyes, calls out to BERGER who is

at her desk--

BERGER is about to answer when her phone rings. She picks it

up, turns to WOODWARD, mouths "it's him" and we

BERGER ON THE PHONE. Again Clawsen on the other end.

Now from this--

BRADLEE IN HIS OFFICE GESTURING

And we

WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN heading toward the office. As they

enter--

CLOSE UP--BRADLEE. He is genuinely enjoying himself. Now, he

puts his hand over the receiver--

Now, as he goes back to talking--

A BIG HEADLINE IN THE POST READING: NIXON AIDES SABOTAGED

DEMOCRATS.

Now we HOLD on that headline as the three deniers are visible

through it in the same places they spoke before.

And now, the headline fades as we

SIMONS IN ROSENFELD'S OFFICE

WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN hurry in.

ROSENFELD and SIMONS just look at each other. They should be

happy, and maybe they are. But at the moment more then

anything else they look scared... HOLD. Then--

THE MONTPELIER ROOM OF THE MADISON HOTEL.

It's a very fancy restaurant and BRADLEE is at a corner table

as WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN sit down. They are exhausted.

A waiter is nearby.

And suddenly he lapses into perfect French with the waiter,

ordering lunch ann salad and as the waiter nods and goes

A wine steward appears, hands BRADLEE the list. As he examines

it, a man walks up to the table, stands there...

CLOSE UP--SEDAM

BRADLEE watching WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN, who are clearly

upset.

CLOSE UP--BRADLEE

Now from BRADLEE--

HUGH SLOAN

holding a broom and dustpan at his front door.

INSIDE THE HOUSE. WOODWARD AND BERNSTEIN are helping SLOAN

with the housework. WOODWARD has a dust mop, BERNSTEIN a

dust cloth. We are mostly in the living room throughout, and

also throughout, the three guys beaver away tidying.

SLOAN points to a shelf. WOODWARD moves to put the cup in

its proper place.

He picks up a dust pan, starts sweeping it full.

WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN look at each other while SLOAN empties

the dust pan into the trash and from there, quickly--

A LONG LONG LONG SHOT OF A COUPLE

walking in the park.

We can't really make them out clearly, we never do in this

little sequence. But the guy is wearing a windbreaker and

has a crew cut and the woman with him is dressed casually

too. He has his arm around her, and they are deep in

conversation.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN sitting on a park bench swilling down

a six-pack.

THE COUPLE walking along. We just can't quite make them out.

But it might be.

WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN staring after the couple, trying to

focus.

THE SLOW-WALKING COUPLE. They continue on. We still don't

see them quite clearly. HOLD... then--

A PUDGY LITTLE MAN HALF-HIDDEN BEHIND A MAGAZINE.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

A DRUGSTORE-TYPE PLACE. WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN are at the

adjoining table.

And he gets up quickly, goes. WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN savor

the moment but only briefly as it hits them--

And as they take off after the agent--

BRADLEE'S OFFICE.

WOODWARD, BERNSTEIN, BRADLEE, SIMONS, ROSENFELD. Wild tension.

The editors have a long story and they all read and pace,

read and pace; the reporters look traumatized with fatigue.

All this goes fast.

They nod.

Now quickly

WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN huddling outside BRADLEE's office.

And as he speaks

BERNSTEIN talking softly from a relatively private phone in

the newsroom. The voice of the lawyer is also whispered and

scared to death.

And on that shout

A HEADLINE IN THE POST--A PHOTO VISIBLE OF HALDEMAN:

THE WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN

BRADLEE

roaring out of his office doorway.

WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN tearing into BRADLEE's office--he

stands scowling at the TV set in a corner of the room--

outside, it is raining like hell.

THE TV SET. SLOAN is walking along toward a large office

building, he is flanked by a lawyer. A TV Reporter (it was

DANIEL SCHORR) is walking alongside, mike in hand.

WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN. They look sick. Desperate, tired,

stunned, confused; there is nothing to say.

BRADLEE glaring at them. HOLD ON BRADLEE... then

THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION

in the rain, and

A CORRIDOR IN THE BUILDING AS THE PUDGY FBI MAN retreats

down the hall. WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN, soaked, chase after

him.

And he tears into an office, slams the door and as we hear

it lock--

THIS IS WHERE THE SOURCE BURNING SCENE WOULD COME BUT I AM

NOT WRITING IT FOR THIS VERSION.

My reasons are as follows: (1) it is a complicated long scene

to put down; (2) we are terribly late in our story; (3) it

would mean, here, two hours into the movie, we are bringing

in an entirely new character; the FBI agent's head to whom

they go, and I think that is unnecessary and confusing; and

(4) most important, I think the characters have been abused

enough in this version--we have added the Sedam scene and

they are berated more in this version by the CREEP people

before things turn. (5) Finally, all this can show in reality

is that they are desperate, and I would rather let the actors

give that to us. I feel that it would be a genuine error at

this time in the flick to go into the convolutions of how

it's bad manners for a reporter to burn a source, if we've

got anything going by this point, I can't conceive of much

an audience will be less interested in than the reporters

misbehaving.

However, if the scene is requested next time through, I shall

be only too happy to oblige.

What I would like to do is cut from the FBI saying "fuck you

fuck you fuck you" and locking his door to the following:

WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN walking in the rain. It's pouring as

they leave FBI Headquarters and they are in anguish.

They are soaked, Nearby is a garbage can, they grab papers,

hold them over their heads, start to walk. Now--

CAMERA MOVES UP HIGHER TO REVEAL

The papers they grabbed were the Post front page. (This

happened.) And as they walked, the Haldeman story was on

their heads. HOLD on the reporters walking miserably through

the rain. Now--

THE POST.

A tremendous pall has settled on the city room. People walk

by, glancing at WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN, who sit almost

immobilized at their desks, wet, whipped; no energy left.

BRADLEE'S OFFICE. SIMONS sits across from BRADLEE as ROSENFELD

enters quietly with a bundle of teletype paper.

BRADLEE has started typing something brief. When ROSENFELD's

done, so is he. He hands it to SIMONS.

CLOSE UP--BRADLEE. He is thoughtful for a while. Then,

spinning around, staring out towards the newsroom:

And he stands, spins out of the room as we

THE FLOWER POT ON WOODWARD'S TERRACE.

The rain has stopped. The apartment is dark. It's late at

night. Inside, the phone RINGS and

WOODWARD'S APARTMENT in the dark as he manages to knock the

phone off its cradle.

He fumbles for the lamp, as it falls with a CRASH--

WOODWARD--MOVING. Hair wild, clothes half-buttoned, he runs

through the dark Washington streets as we

TWO WELL-DRESSED MEN in the shadows across the street, going

in the same direction and

WOODWARD spotting them, picking up the pace and

THE TWO MEN moving faster too and now

A BUNCH OF CABS. WOODWARD jumps into the first and as it

roars off

THE TWO MEN getting into a cab also, roaring off in the same

direction and

WOODWARD'S CAB taking a corner fast and as it goes on, HOLD

until the second cab takes the same corner, faster, and now

WOODWARD jumping out of his cab, fumbling into his pockets

for change as we

THE TWO MEN getting out of their cab, paying, and as their

cab drives off

WOODWARD diving back into his cab and in a moment it is

roaring again through the night and we

THE TWO WELL-DRESSED MEN standing on the sidewalk, watching

as WOODWARD disappears into the night and then suddenly,

DEEP THROAT IN CLOSE UP AND MAD.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

DEEP THROAT and WOODWARD in the underground garage.

WOODWARD exploding.

DEEP THROAT. He blinks for a moment. Then he begins to

whisper.

WOODWARD takes a breath, nods.

And from his weathered face

WOODWARD

walking up to his apartment house later that night. He sees,

and then we see, BERNSTEIN, asleep at the front door. He

comes awake as WOODWARD approaches.

BRADLEE IN HIS DOORWAY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

It's a house with a lawn and from somewhere there is the

SOUND of dogs barking.

WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN moving up the walk to BRADLEE.

As WOODWARD beckons for him to move out into the lawn--

THE THREE OF THEM MOVING OUT ONTO THE LAWN. It's October

now. You can see their breaths as they speak.

BRADLEE. He nods again, starts walking the two reporters

back toward WOODWARD's car.

THE RED KARMANN GHIA as the three approach.

And as they get back into the car--

THE NEWSROOM--EARLY MORNING

and it's empty pretty much, except at their desks sit WOODWARD

and BERNSTEIN, typing away. They type on and on and as they

do, voices are HEARD, the same voices we've become familiar

with, the WESTERN SENATOR, the CREEP P.R. MAN and the WHITE

HOUSE SPOKESMAN.

WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN work on. And now, as the voices

continue condemning, we see them--all the President's men--

as their faces flash on the screen for an instant--only these

aren't fashion portraits we're looking at, these are the mug

shots of the men taken when they went to jail and they flash

on, the mug shots and the name and across each the word

CONVICTED. There's VIRGILIO GONZALES--CONVICTED, and EUGENIO

MARTINEZ, CONVICTED, and FRANK STURGIS, CONVICTED, and BERNARD

BARKER, CONVICTED, and JAMES McCORD, CONVICTED, and HOWARD

HUNT, CONVICTED, and GORDON LIDDY, CONVICTED, and DONALD

SEGRETTI, CONVICTED, and DWIGHT CHAPIN, CONVICTED, and now

the denunciations are louder, shriller, briefer.

WOODWARD and BERNSTEIN type on. Their machines are the only

SOUND in the enormous room. And now more mug shots appear--

JEB MAGRUDER, CONVICTED, EGIL KROGH, CONVICTED, JOHN DEAN,

CONVICTED, JOHN EHRLICHMAN, CONVICTED, CHARLES COLSON,

CONVICTED, HERBERT KALMBACH, CONVICTED, and LARUE and PORTER

and MITCHELL and HALDEMAN--all, all the President's men--

CONVICTED. Now--

THE CAMERA STARTS TO MOVE toward the pillar, the one that

separates the two reporters, and the denunciations are still

going on, but not so loud now, not so fierce.

The CAMERA is almost at the pillar now.

BERNSTEIN bums a cigarette from a cleaning lady. WOODWARD

kicks his typewriter. Then they both go back to work.

Now we're at the pillar. That's all we see. Just that. And

all we HEAR is the two reporters working away, on and on

until--
