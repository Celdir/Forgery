50   ANGLE ON WATER

51   CAMERON'S POV

The sun glistens on the wet, wild young perfection of her face,

ingenuously sparkling laughter and for an instant it's breathtaking

- a universal boyhood fantasy to suddenly be thrown this close to

that kind of "movie star" beauty. It's something Cameron feels in

the pit of his stomach.

Regaining his composure enough to attempt flattery, but he means it.

As they are only in a few feet of water, there is no longer any

reason to hold her. He starts to put her down.

Grinning, he carries her toward shore.

53   ANGLE ON ELI

Eli begins to stroll along the sand toward the pilings which support

the pier. Cameron hesitates, but Eli's manner compels him to

follow.

They have reached the pier.   Eli stops, he is watching something

O.S.

54   CAMERON'S POV - POLICE CAR

55   ANGLE ON ELI AND CAMERON

Cameron studies Eli, not knowing what to make of him.

Cameron half laughs despite himself.

WIDER ANGLE

Jake has spotted them and is approaching with his men and the

Production Manager. Eli puts his hand on Cameron's shoulder and

steps out into the sunlight.

A TRAM beeps, clangs and passes between them, interrupting Jake and

leaving him sputtering. As it departs, Eli seizes the moment.

There is silence. Eli stands thoughtfully kicking the sand with his

toe. Then Jake starts shouting again.

Eli's words are exploding in Cameron's mind -- that illusory event

on the bridge has crystallized into hard reality.

Cameron vaguely understands that Eli is trying to pass him off as

Burt and that he, somehow, may be saved by going along with this

madness. Eli, turning to Jake, continues passionately...

The Chief is dazed. If this is Burt, the stunt man, he is obviously

alive. Jake goes to Cameron.

The Chief stares at Cameron. His clothes and hair are wet. There

is a small bruise on his cheek from when he fell out of the

Duesenberg. He looks the part. Jake turns to Eli with resignation.

He walks to the waiting police car, surrounded by TOURISTS snapping

pictures. He glares at them, angry at the world. Eli puts his arm

on Cameron's shoulder and leads him through the dispersing crowd

toward the hotel. Eli is now easygoing and friendly.

They have reached the steps of the HOTEL. A BUS has stopped in

front. TOURISTS are piling out. The POLICE CAR pulls up and parks

nearby. Jake and his men can be seen surveying the crowd.

Eli turns back to Cameron as they mount the steps.

The have reached the front door.   Eli holds it open for Cameron.

In exhaustion and resignation, Cameron nods and wearily closes his

eyes.

TWO SHOT - CAMERON AND DENISE

He studies the view, his attention focused on Nina.

Moving to a pile of laundry heaped on the floor, she pokes around

with the toe of her shoe.

Snaring a crumpled garment, she kicks it toward Cameron, who catches

it instinctively, then holds it up for inspection -- a pair of

(Nina's) lace panties. He grins, mildly embarrassed by the charade.

62   EXT.   CHURCHYARD - ANGLE ON CHUCK - LATER THAT DAY

As the Messenger leaves, Chuck strolls over to where Cameron stands

waiting, circles around him, sizing him up. Cameron is no longer

wearing the uniform, but now is in jeans and a work shirt.

63   ANGLE ON CAMERON (AND STEEPLE)

He takes a running start and leaps hard.    While he's still in mid-

air, Chuck yells.

Cameron has landed three beyond the mark and looks up at Chuck a bit

shaken.

Chuck launches himself head-first. His hands touch the ground just

beyond the second mark to break his fall, easing him into a shoulder

roll, he somersaults to his feet.

He takes a running start and does the same.   Not quite as well, but

well enough. As he rolls to his feet:

Chuck turns on him enraged, overreacting.

ANGLE ON CREW

Eli stands amidst the camera crew photographing the scene.   He is

waving for order.

As Eli steps down from the DOLLY, a solemn, quiet man approaches him

from among the onlookers. It is SAM BAUM (the writer).

The A.D. Calls "Five minutes" and the crew moves toward the coffee

urn. Eli wanders toward the door, Sam pursuing.

69   EXT.   MUNICIPAL BUILDING

70   INT.   HOTEL DINING ROOM - THAT NIGHT

Cameron is starting to bristle at Eli's needling, particularly with

Nina watching.

They all laugh.

The deadly in Eli's voice was more than intended and there is

suddenly an awkward silence at the table. Cameron eyes Eli with a

wry smile.

Everyone laughs.

Jake, the Chief of Police, is seen in the background approaching the

table. Cameron spots him and starts to rise.

76    ANGLE ON CAMERON

For a moment they search each other's eyes -- for intentions.   Then

she glances at the tower.

Cameron's mind is racing over all the things he'd like to say so she

would know him instantly. But his answer is simple and sounds

sincere.

She understands the slightly jealous rebuke for her blind faith in

Eli. Her laughing answer hangs like a challenge.

For a moment he weighs it: whether to "run" or stay. Then acts on

his decision. Starting to laugh, he takes her hand and pulls her

toward the tower. She holds back, struggling playfully.

Unable to elude Eli in his basket, Nina turns on him in mock

frustration.

Privately, she gives Cameron's arm an affectionate squeeze, then

disappears around the corner of the building. He is left holding

the beach bag, pursued by the Peter Pan in the basket. It has now

dropped to ground level so Eli is looking up at Cameron.

Eli's basket now moves up a few feet so he's looking down at

Cameron, riding beside him while he walks.

81A   We see a telescoped view of THE POLICE ROADBLOCK at the end of a

Cameron's confusion changes to helpless fury as he kicks and

struggles against a forest of grasping hands ripping his clothes

away, passing him back toward the rear of the line.

Whores have left their cots to join in the assault, screeching in

glee. As he maniacally lashes out at his good-natured molesters,

the blood from Cameron's face smears a whore's body.

Instantly everything stops. Cameron is sprawled half-naked on his

knees at the end of the line. Enraged, he whirls toward Eli who has

caused this humiliation. Then the CLAPPING begins, the CAST and

CREW applauding his stunt. People slap him on the back admiringly.

A robe is thrown around him. He is helped to his feet. Suddenly

Nina is there flinging her arms about him and kissing him on the

mouth.

He is pulled away from her by the backslappers. Now Cameron is

responding to this strange new sensation -- the warmth of public

acclaim. He regains his poise, hoping his embarrassing anger wasn't

noticed. Chuck is now beside him, reaching up to the wound on

Cameron's face and pulling away the plastic makeup patch with fake

blood inside; the "wound" is gone. He starts feeling Cameron's

shoulders, arms and ribs for possible damage.

Look at soldier boy there, jumping

off fucking buildings, risking his

ass every day, doing stuff way over

his head!...What would you do in

that plane, Lucky, if you were about

to die?

What else? I'd dance for joy...I'd

probably do a jig.

Great!   That's what we'll do.

Eli...

All right, not a jig...a

Charleston...

A Charleston?

...On the wing of the airplane!

...That's ridiculous.

You're damn right...

The Charleston is silly...They won't

believe it.

I'll do it so they'll believe it!

You'll get a laugh, Eli.

During this he has taken the wig and puts it over his head, glancing

in the mirror.

He does.

Instead of turning off the clock, he crosses to the Old Lady's dress

on a hanger. He looks at the dress appraisingly.

Disturbed, Nina leaves the bed, turns off the alarm clock and

adjusts the wig properly on its stand.

They embrace and cling to each other. She starts back for the bed,

but he detours for the clock and pulls out the alarm again, and

again it BEGINS RINGING.

With the alarm still ringing, he starts toward the bed.

The whole idea is so incongruous that she starts laughing. He gets

on the bed with her. THE ALARM CONTINUES TO RING. They struggle

about, giggling at the absurdity.

While he moves over her body, she grabs a pillow and hurtles it at

the clock. It falls over, but keeps on ringing. By now, Cameron

has entered Nina and she is rapidly becoming more involved in that,

than in the clock.

He takes Nina by the hand and pulls her down beside him, kneeling on

the floor.

Nina's listening intensely but something catches her eye. Among the

tourists at the doorway stands Cameron, who has paused to watch, his

costume slung over his shoulder. He nods to her with a small tender

smile. Subtly, so Eli won't notice, she smiles back, then renews

her concentration.

Sam crosses over to them and kneels beside Eli and Nina.

An elegantly-dressed CARIBINERRI (ITALIAN POLICEMAN) appears.

The unexpected sound of laughter makes her turn to see a SMALL GROUP

OF PEOPLE who've gathered beside their PARKED CARS watching.

She pulls free of the Caribinerri and, trying to kneel down,

stumbles and falls. Now, like some confused child, she searches

among the garments. Taking a SCROLL from a wooden box, she shakes

it at them like a schoolteacher would a ruler.

She now holds up a fist from which dangles a swastika on a sash.

Her voice suddenly fierce with the pain of that memory.

The Caribinerri, spellbound, has taken a backward step, bumping into

a REFLECTOR, which now teeters and falls into the scene, knocking

off his hat, barely missing the Old Lady and crashing across the

grave and shattering all illusion. The Caribinerri stands there

From behind her back, she takes an APPLE with a tiny cocktail

parasol stuck in it and holds it out to Cameron. Cameron lies

glaring at her with mounting rage.

Nina stands there shaken, looking at him sadly.

She leaves. Cameron lies there seething, then abruptly leaps up and

storms into the bathroom. Sam sits rubbing his head, resumes

typing. Cameron rages out of the bathroom, flings himself onto the

bed. Unwinding the elastic bandage, he sprays ethyl chloride on his

knee. Sam's typing stops.

Cameron ignores Sam.

He begins to type again, then philosophically...

But he says this so sadly and looks so miserable that Sam knows he

has reached him and it touched.

ANGLE shifts to include Cameron a few stools down.    He looks up from

his beer and crosses to henry.

As the BARTENDER is taking away the empties, Henry puts his finger

down on a DIME.

Cameron pales, knowing that drunken Henry's desire for revenge can

expose him to the police. He grabs the dime from Henry's fingers

and drops it into a PEANUT VENDING MACHINE.

Cameron stuffs the bag of peanuts in Henry's shirt pocket, grabs his

suitcase and hustles him out of the bar toward the FRONT DOOR.

They have reached the HOTEL DOORWAY.   By now, Henry is convinced

Cameron means business. He stops.

Cameron, realizing for the first time that instead of being ashamed

or frightened, she is livid with rage?

Nina lets out an incoherent roar of rage.

Cameron crosses to the door. Searching through this madness for

some kind of logic, turning on her.

He is at a loss for words.

Cameron, exhausted, slides down the wall and sits on the floor.

He says nothing. She on the bed and he on the floor, are drained of

all strength and emotion.

...Could've handled it later on. It

doesn't look so raunchy after it's

cut...Maybe I'd of got them

stoned...something...but for Eli to

trap them like that...

Beautiful...There's a second school

of thought that says the first

school is all wet. It says, "Keep

the windows rolled up tight and wait

for the air bubble."

Say it was an accident...benefit of

the doubt. But then to use me that

way...like a gadget...Why would Eli

do that? He's not a cruel man...

He's not a cruel man.   He's a crazy

man. A maniac.

What?

"The water pressure at two hundred

feet can crush a man into the size

of an egg." He wants to get that on

film....so he's gonna kill me.

What in God's name are you babbling

about?!

It's a rotten shame about your folks

and your naked ass, but dying always

scared me a little, okay?

To keep from exploding, Nina opens her luggage and furiously starts

repacking.

Against her instincts, Nina is emotionally affected by what Cameron

says.

The TELEPHONE RINGS. Her head whips to look at it.     It continues

ringing, but she doesn't move.

Cameron calmly picks up the phone.

He walks over to the still-stricken Nina and tenderly embraces her.

She leans against him, the trembling subsiding.

When he doesn't answer, Nina resorts to her last defense, irrational

anger.

By now she is stalking about the room throwing things from one

suitcase to another as Cameron silently watches her.

Eli, on the edge of nervous exhaustion, is actually close to tears.

They have reached a turn in the corridor where each would go his

separate way. They stop.

Nina is paralyzed with shock.

179A   From some hospital props, he grabs a wheelchair and shoves it toward

Nina cannot endure another moment of this charade.

We sense in him the fatigue he is describing, then, pushing aside

that memory.

Cameron starts running across the room and just as he's about to

hurl it, he COLLIDES with a jutting shelf, which knocks him flat on

his back. The shelf falls and thirty or forty one-gallon PAINT CANS

cascade on top of him. It looks disastrous. Nina runs to him,

terrified, but before the last can has even come to rest, Cameron

emerges from the pile of cans, throwing them aside, still thrashing

and screaming as he struggles to his feet.

At the sight of him, Nina starts laughing. But Cameron, who has

somehow managed to keep his grip on the laundry basket, raises it

over his head as if nothing has happened, hurls the clothes bin,

screaming:

With the effort, Cameron's feet fly out from under him as if he had

stepped in oil. In fact, he has stepped in paint, and lands flat on

his ass in the green goo. Nina "bracks" out an uncontrollable

guffaw.

Shamed, Nina runs to him.

But, as she reaches him, her feet too are caught in the paint and

she slides forward like an ice skater, spraddling him, landing on

her ass. His rage vanishes as he points at her, breaking into a

fiendish, uncontrollable cackle. These pratfalls are a catharsis

that has released the pressure and the madness. They attempt to

gain their feet, skidding and sliding in the paint. He succeeds,

but Nina fails.

Although Cameron's got nothing in his hands, he pantomimes swinging

that fifty-pound ice cream bucket around in the air, losing his

balance and landing on his back in the paint beside Nina. Her

hysteria is renewed, but Cameron stops laughing.

Despite the horror of it, Nina starts giggling.   She can't help it.

Nina has come to life, her eyes aglow like a shrewd little girl

who's already decided how the fairy tale will end!

Nina has walked around to the back of the Duesenberg and opens the

The technician tightens a final screw on the red light then, leaning

back out of the car, yells O.S.

Cameron, barely hearing, looks straight ahead without response.

Jake lounges at the driver's window, kibitzing the operation.

The words "CAMERA ON" sound exactly like "CAMERON." It sounded as

though his real name was called and he automatically answered. Has

his identity been exposed? His eyes widen. The technician, getting

no response, calls to Jake.

He whirls to see Jake staring at him. His hand darts to the

ignition key, the engine roars to life.

Cameron realizes his error, but it's too late, he's in a panic. In

his mind, he's given himself away. The road ahead is clear -- GO!

He jams the car in gear and slams the accelerator to the floor. The

Duesenberg leaps forward, screeching wildly. In its wake -- chaos.

Sam has run up, out of breath, followed by crew members.

A horn honks. It is Jake who, in his enthusiasm, has driven the

police car bumping over the marshes to Eli and Cameron.

He moves toward police car.

Eli stops, suddenly registering what Cameron had said.

Eli is climbing into the helicopter.

The helicopter takes off, zooms under the bridge, up into a

hammerhead and soars back, while Cameron continues to scream at it.

Eli's voice on the helicopter's P.A. speaker echoes through the

canyon, as the chopper cavorts overhead and skims away.

How tall was King Kong...
