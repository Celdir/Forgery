BLACK.

Over CREDITS we HEAR:

INT. ROBERT'S MANSION - DAY

As the conversation continues we see:

1. A MAID clean an expansive living room, waxing a mahogany

table.

2. A BUTLER open sliding doors to an empty grand sitting

room.

3. An overhead shot as a SERVANT carries packages up a long

winding staircase.

INT. ROBERT'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

And right on cue, we see for the first time -- ROBERT MILLER

(60) -- sitting on a sofa across from MARIA BARTIROMO and a

CAMERA CREW, mid-interview. ELLEN MILLER (58) watches on a

nearby MONITOR.

CUT TO BLACK.

CLOUDS GIVE WAY TO A:

FALCON 900EX - SOARING THROUGH THE SKIES AT 550MPH

And we push tighter into the plane, cutting into the engine,

as we hear a sonic boom and focus inside, revealing...

INT. FALCON

A sleek, slate-gray cabin, divided into three seating areas.

At the back of the plane, five AIDES DE CAMP chatter in hushed

tones, pouring over a sea of red-inked paper.

In the galley, GAVIN BRIAR (42), pours a coffee. He brings it

who sits alone in his private area facing the cockpit,

scribbling his own red-ink across a stack of CONTRACT

DOCUMENTS. His effortless slouch, silver hair, and all-

commanding mannerisms make one thing clear: Robert's our man.

Robert sips it.

We push into a close-up of Robert, as he contemplates what

this would mean.

EXT. WESTCHESTER AIRFIELD - MOMENTS LATER

The ROAR of thirty million dollars landing near tall grass.

EXT. HANGAR - CONTINUOUS

Robert walks down the passenger steps onto the tarmac,

followed by Gavin and the aides.

They approach a waiting MERCEDES MAYBACH. The aides hand file

BOXES and BRIEFCASES to the Hispanic driver, RAMON, who loads

them into the trunk.

EXT. STREETS - CONTINUOUS

The blur of city lights as the limo passes over bridges and

towards the city and Park Avenue and finally approaches

EXT. GRACIE SQUARE - ROBERT'S MANSION - CONTINUOUS

An enormous turn-of-the-last-century Stanford-White-designed

red-brick MANSION- two already-giant townhouses combined.

Robert and Gavin exit the limo and head inside.

INT. ROBERT'S MANSION - ENTRY HALL - CONTINUOUS

It's our first glimpse of Robert's home, and it doesn't

disappoint. It's an 1850's Tudor given a full once-over,

maintaining period details but updated with a Modernist

flair. It actually works.

A SERVANT takes Robert's briefcase from him as he enters,

handing him three small PRESENTS which he puts under his arm.

We HEAR sounds of a DINNER PARTY complete with CHILDREN

laughing. Hold on Robert's face- some mixture of excitement

and anticipation.

INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

A party in progress, dinner already served.

Seated around a large square table are: ELLEN (58, Robert's

wife), BROOKE (28, Robert's daughter), PETER (31, Robert's

son), TOM (Brooke's boyfriend), ANNE (Peter's wife), and

THREE GRANDCHILDREN.

Ellen's playing with one of the kids. She sees Robert.

The kids clamor for Robert's attention. He moves around the

table, hugging them all.

Robert hands out the presents, and the kids unwrap them in a

frenzy. He continues making the rounds until he finally gets to

Brooke and Peter, seated next to each other.

They embrace, but we notice clear restraint, a marked contrast

to his behavior towards their kids.

Robert rounds the table and takes his seat next to Ellen as

she discreetly waves to the SERVANTS.

Another SERVANT enters with a CAKE flickering birthday

candles. Everyone notices and starts CLAPPING.

Robert smiles. They finish cheering, then CLINK glasses for a

toast.

Everyone laughs a little.

They all LAUGH.

More group LAUGHTER.

More LAUGHTER. Robert laughs, too. He sees Ellen hug Peter

across the room.

INT. STUDY - MOMENTS LATER

A warm, clubby room, kept traditional. Robert pours out two

SCOTCHES.

Robert brings the drinks to the banquette where Brooke rests

with an open FOLDER. He resumes signing papers.

Brooke nods, tries to smile.

She nods again, unconvinced, then pulls out a MAGAZINE.

He looks closely at it. A "Forbes" cover story:

"Robert Miller, the Oracle of Gracie Square: Investor profits

in uncertain times by predicting housing crisis."

Brooke leans back and stares at him.

Brooke shoots him a look.

Staring at him, then

INT. ENTRY HALL - LATER

Ellen is supervising the yawning children as the party winds

down. She sees Robert put on his OVERCOAT.

She holds a beat, then approaches and straightens his collar.

He kisses her and starts to exit. She stares as he walks out.

Hold on her.

EXT. LOWER BROADWAY - NIGHT

A TAXI stops in front of a large frosted-glass apartment

entrance. Robert exits, paying the DRIVER through the window.

INT. LOFT APARTMENT - NIGHT

JULIE COTE (32) sits at the head of a marble table in the

exquisite space. It's the modern mirror of Robert's mansion,

the lines carried through fully this time. And Julie is the

modern woman: sleek, fit, and flowing, even at home.

She's intently focused, handwriting personal notes onto a stack

of INVITATIONS for the "Julie Cote Gallery - Paintings by Victor

Rodriguez - April 10th" as she downs the last of a WHITE WINE.

She's got a seating chart out that she's working on.

The INTERCOM RINGS. Julie heads over, sees Robert's face on

the VIDEO MONITOR. She holds a beat.

EXT. LOFT APARTMENT - SAME

Robert waits in the cold, staring into the camera as Julie

watches him from inside the loft, not moving.

After a second, the door BUZZES open.

INT. JULIE'S LOFT - SAME

Robert enters. Julie is already back at the table, writing.

She's arranging 4 POLAROIDS of different paintings on a wall,

along with a SEATING CHART. He walks down the long hall.

He comes up behind her, running his arms across her stomach.

She crosses to the open kitchen and pours out more wine,

lights a cigarette. Robert trails.

They stare at each other as she drags off the cigarette, then

stubs it out. He gestures to the dining table.

She stares, still in the moment. Then she heads to the fridge

and slides out a homemade BIRTHDAY CAKE. He stares at it.

She reaches for the cake, grabbing a piece of it with her

hand and... SMEARS IT ONTO HIS FACE.

The tension breaks, and they LAUGH. He grabs her and they

kiss furiously, pulling at each other's clothes as she pushes

him backwards into the bedroom and they begin to make love.

INT. GREENBERG & COMPANY - OFFICE HALL - THE NEXT DAY

Robert enters the palatial quarters, decorated with ornate

18th century furniture. As we'll see soon, it's a stark

contrast to his functional empire. He follows a striking

British RECEPTIONIST down a long hallway passing a massive

glass conference room. They arrive at

INT. GREENBERG'S OFFICE - SAME

The receptionist escorts Robert in. Standing to greet him is

JEFFREY GREENBERG (53), handsome and charming.

She exits. Robert sits. A moment of silence.

A beat.

Jeffrey stares at him contemplatively for a moment, then

appears to reach some sort of conclusion.

EXT. STREET - MADISON AVENUE

Off Robert as he storms the pavement.

INT. ROBERT'S LIMO - CONTINUOUS

And enters his waiting limousine, SLAMMING the door.

They drive off. Robert turns on the TELEVISION.

Close on Robert, trying hard to contain his building rage.

His phone VIBRATES a TEXT, from Julie: "See you at 8!" He

stares at it, breathes in deeply.

The CARPHONE rings: "Gavin."

INT. ROBERT'S BEDROOM - LATER

Ellen stands tying Robert's TIE in front of a dressing mirror.

She finishes tying it. He looks in the mirror.

He stares at her softly, but stays silent.

He straightens his jacket, laughs.

A KNOCK at the door.

Ellen slaps his behind.

INT. MAYBACH - NIGHT

Robert and Gavin ride, both shuffling papers.

INT. FOUR SEASONS RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

Robert trails Gavin up the stairs as he types out a TEXT

MESSAGE to Julie: "Wrapping up mtg- be there soon."

The MAITRE'D spots Robert and greets him as he approaches.

He leads Robert and Gavin into the

INT. POOL ROOM

Where we see Brooke and Peter seated with a group of

EXECUTIVES including AIMES (45), and BARNES (43).

Displeasure immediately registers on Robert's face.

Gavin shakes his head. They approach the table.

Robert phone VIBRATES. It's "Julie" calling. He silences it.

Robert drifts as the suits prattle on.

INT. POOL ROOM - LATER

The execs are still chattering. Robert is sweating. Julie

calls again. Robert silences it again. Then he gets a text:

"9:40pm - FUCK YOU."

Silence.

Robert refuses Aimes' hand and heads out. Brooke rises.

They move off to the side.

INT. FOUR SEASONS RESTAURANT - MOVING

As Brooke catches up with her father in the hallway.

26 She nods, as Robert dashes down the hall. 26

She's dressed in a burnt red, form-fitting Lanvin dress, hair

coiffed, perfectly made-up-- if we didn't suspect anything,

we'd think she was the precise image of New York art-world

success.

Julie pulls her hair back and straightens, enters the main

gallery...

INT. GALLERY - CONTINUOUS

Where she quickly sees Robert searching for her through the

crowd. She stops dead, considers going back into the office...

But she stands firm. Robert finds her eyes. He stares at her.

She stares back, with a simple look that says, plainly:

"Go away."

She turns and heads off to talk to a group of PATRONS,

including the painter VICTOR. One of the group is a DASHING

YOUNG MAN- is he flirting with her?

Robert approaches, staring at the young man, then at Julie.

She's all smiles, but she doesn't immediately introduce him.

He stands there, until--

Robert shakes hands with the group, exchanging pleasantries,

especially kind to young AVA (15).

Julie begins to walk off, disappearing into the crowd.

Robert trails Julie, moving up to her quickly. He reaches out

to touch her and she spins towards him violent, definitive.

Julie heads back to the buyers.

Dismayed, Robert takes a last glance, then recedes out

towards the entry desk.

He approaches the gallery assistant he was talking to earlier

and picks up the buy sheet at the desk, marking some pieces.

Robert walks out and hails his driver.

INT. ROBERT'S BEDROOM - LATER

Off Robert, in bed with Ellen who is asleep. He gets up and

stumbles to the bathroom, puts on a robe.

INT. PRIVATE ELEVATOR

He approaches the basement level carrying a folder of

papers...

INT. SERVICE KITCHEN

And sits at the counter, staring at a REPORT of some kind. He

refills a glass of SCOTCH, downs it.

INT. JULIE'S LOFT - NIGHT

Julie's a touch worn from the evening, but she's still

composed. She sits with five guests including her gallery

assistant, the HANDSOME YOUNG MAN from earlier, TWO WOMEN,

and TWO GUYS who look like painters. One does a line of

COCAINE off a "Fantom" magazine.

Julie's phone RINGS. She looks at the Caller-ID, (which shows

her home line calling) confused.

INT. JULIE'S LOFT - BEDROOM

Robert watches Julie through a crack in the doorway. He's on

her CORDLESS phone. We INTERCUT.

She hangs up and begins to clear out the guests.

Robert sits, unbuttoning his collar.

INT. JULIE'S LOFT - LIVING ROOM

The guests finally leave. Julie heads to the bedroom...

INT. JULIE'S LOFT - BEDROOM

And finds Robert sitting, looking a little too comfortable.

She walks off into the

Robert follows her. They stand at a great distance as she

downs a red wine.

Her face falls slightly, but she keeps her grace -- and

her anger.

He crosses towards her.

He sits down next to her.

She stares at him, laughs a little in devastation, then...

Hold on Robert's face as he stares at her, silently.

Julie is on the bed, holding herself, crying.

Robert comes up next to her, hugs her.

She's keeps crying, but...

EXT. HIGHWAY - DEAD OF NIGHT

A MERCEDES 450 SEL driving the interstate towards

Connecticut. Billie Holiday sings her 1959 "Just One More

Chance." We hold on a two-shot through the windshield: Julie

rests her head on Robert's shoulder.

And the camera moves closer into Robert's face, Julie snuggled

next to him, Billie's music lulling the moment into

tranquility, and finally, just finally, Robert has a moment's

respite, as he slowly closes his heavy eyelids, nodding off

into a trance of desperately needed sleep until...

A SCRAPING METALLIC NOISE jolts us back to

EXT. HIGHWAY

Reality -- as the car drifts into the CENTER MEDIAN where

the tire catches on a small metal SCRAP and BLOWS OUT,

flipping the car over and over until it CAREENS to a halt.

INT. CAR

Robert's eyes flutter open as he comes to, groggy. He's badly

injured, but breathing. He starts to feel his body. Movement

returns...

He looks over at Julie.

It is instantly obvious she is dead: she's been nearly

decapitated, a deep gash ripping through her neck.

Shock, followed quickly by panic.

We hear a DRIPPING sound. A gas leak...

Robert reaches into his pocket and dials 911... He looks at

the phone just before pressing "Send"... and hangs up.

He tries to open the door. It's stuck. He KICKS at it. It opens.

EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

He drags himself out of the car. Stands. Smoke is still

rising from the smashed hood. He pulls up his shirt. A DEEP

BRUISE: a broken rib from the steering column. He winces.

He takes a few steps forward, moving around to the passenger

side. He looks again at Julie. Horrific. He reaches out to

touch her, then stops.

Hold on his face. He sinks to his knees, putting his head in

his bloody hands. He SCREAMS.

Then he rises, and begins hiking to the side of the road.

EXT. FIELDS - DEAD OF NIGHT

Robert walks and walks through tall grass.

In the distance behind him, A MASSIVE EXPLOSION lights up the

sky in a fireball as the gas tank finally catches, incinerating

the car and its contents.

INT. GAS STATION BATHROOM

Robert cleans himself up in the sink, applying soap and water

to his cut stomach, scrubbing frantically, He takes all the

paper towels and puts them in his pocket.

EXT. GAS STATION - LATER

Robert picks up a PAYPHONE by the bathrooms, cradling it to

his ear with his sleeve and dialing with his other finger

through his shirt fiber.

RINGING, then...

EXT. CAR WRECKAGE SITE

POLICE CARS flash lights. An EMT unloads Julie's charred

CORPSE into a BODY BAG. INVESTIGATORS sift through rubble.

DET. MICHAEL BRYER (43) sits in a TAN SEDAN, drinking a cup

of deli coffee. Barely awake, he stares out the window at a

bunch of STATE TROOPERS arguing with his partner, MILLS.

MILLS breaks away from the uniforms and approaches, shaking

his head. Bryer gets out of the car.

Bryer heads over to the car, his interest piqued.

Mills shines his flashlight towards the passenger side.

Bryer immediately sees what he means-- dented metal, even in

the burnt door.

Bryer bends his head down to the car's passenger side,

looking off into the distance of the path Robert took just

moments before.

EXT. GAS STATION

About twenty yards down the road, a BLACK SUV hums, waiting.

Robert opens the passenger door and gets in.

INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

Inside is JIMMY GRANT (23), Black.

They start to drive. Jimmy looks over at Robert; he's pretty

banged up.

That's correct.

Because I want to be very clear

about this: you called me to give

you a ride. I'm giving you a ride.

No, you're not. We're not here.

Oh, no? Then where the fuck are we?

We're both alseep right now. At

home. Which is where you left your

phone, right?

Right.

Because if anyone checks...

Why is anyone gonna check?

They're not, as long as we're not here.

Anybody know you're here?

No.

Somebody knows you're here?

No!

But somebody knows-- you're not there.

Well, my girl...

Oh, Jesus, Jimmy...

Man, you call up two am, what the

fuck you want? She asked me where I

was going.

A beat.

Jimmy exhales a long sigh.

Jimmy swerves the car to the side of the road and stops.

Jimmy waits a moment, then re-enters the road.

Robert winces in pain.

Robert is holding his side. He pulls up his shirt. Jimmy sees

the awful purple bruise from the steering column.

EXT. THIRD AVENUE - NIGHT

The SUV stops a few blocks from Robert's house.

Robert looks at Jimmy, eyes tearing.

Jimmy's car drives off. Robert hobbles up the block.

INT. ROBERT'S MANSION - NIGHT

Robert enters the basement. He runs into a security

monitoring room. We see a street view of cameras outside the

door he just entered. He pulls DISCS out of VIDEO RECORDERS.

INT. ROBERT'S MANSION - SERVICE KITCHEN

Robert stands in front of a bin marked INCINERATOR. He is

wearing a new T-SHIRT and SLACKS.

He places all of his bloodied clothes and the video discs

into the incinerator, pouring LIGHTER FLUID on top of them.

Staring at the clothes, he notices one cuff link is missing.

He strikes a match, setting the items on fire and closes the

hopper.

As he exits the burning area--

Robert turns, startled.

The servant shuffles off.

INT. ROBERT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Robert quietly undresses, leaving on the white UNDERSHIRT. He

presses at his rib, winces again. Then he gets into bed and

stares at the ceiling.

She rolls over. Hold on Robert's face.

EXT. PARK BENCH - DAY

SYD FELDER (64) sits next to Robert.

Robert stands.

EXT. FREMAUT ACCOUNTING HEADQUARTERS - LATER

We follow CHRIS VOGLER (52) through the busy lobby out to the

street. He crosses Park Avenue and gets into Robert's limo.

INT. LIMO - CONTINUOUS

Robert opens the Percocet bottle, downs four PILLS.

Chris enters and sits. Robert mimes a question.

The carphone RINGS.

Chris exits.

A beat as Robert rubs his eyes.

He hangs up and exhales deeply.

INT. MILLER CAPITAL - LATER

We track through a Spartanly-furnished trading office: high-

design with lacquer and muted mahogany. PEOPLE at COMPUTERS

make phone calls. CLOCKS show different time zones.

INT. ROBERT'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Brooke sits across from Robert. They're reviewing papers.

INT. ROBERT'S OFFICE RECEPTION - CONTINUOUS

Det. Bryer enters the glass doors and badges the

RECEPTIONIST.

INT. ROBERT'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

The Intercom handset RINGS.

Brooke exits. Robert steels himself.

INT. ROBERT'S OFFICE CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

As Brooke exits, she and Bryer cross paths. She eyes him...

He doesn't look familiar. Off Brooke, curious.

INT. ROBERT'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Robert leads Bryer towards two sofas where they sit opposite

each other.

Bryer shifts, edging forward.

This is awful. This is truly awful.

We're searching the area right now.

So no boyfriend that you know of?

Actually we didn't talk about

personal matters.

She was just an employee, right?

Well not an employee. I was an investor.

Why'd you invest?

Why did I invest?

Yeah, why'd you invest?

She had a great eye. She found me

those Bryce Marden's there. They

went up in value very quickly, and

on the basis of that I agreed to

fund some of the gallery.

Would you mind if we searched

her apartment?

Why would I mind?

It's in your company's name.

Oh, right. Yeah. Of course. Sure,

go ahead.

Now, Mr. Miller...

Mmm-hmm?

Why would you lease an apartment

for Ms. Cote? Is that something you

normally do for your employees?

Actually I said that she wasn't an

employee, but-- I think she'd just come

over from Paris if I remember, and she

needed a place to entertain buyers.

So you leased her this apartment.

It was through our holding company.

You seem a little confused by all

this...

I am. But I'll get there. Gimme time.

Alright.

Now, I don't mean to be

indelicate...

But you're going to be

indelicate...

Well, from what I've been able to

gather, she wasn't exactly an art

star. I mean, she worked for a

couple a dealers in Paris, but...

Oh, okay, I get it, so why would

I invest in her and help her find

a place?

Something like that, yeah.

It's very simple, detective. I invest

in people I believe in. I thought

she'd do well, so I backed her, she

did. It's is simple as that.

Robert shows him to the door. Bryer turns back.

Bryer heads out.

We hold on Robert as he closes the door and winces in pain.

INT. ELLEN'S OFFICE - OUTER SUITE - DAY

INT. ELLEN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Ellen's standing, cradling the phone and packing her handbag.

Across her desk, SUSAN (30s) reviews the guest list for the

Ellen smooths her suit and puts her bag over her shoulder.

EXT. ELLEN'S OFFICE

Ellen exits the building, passes the doorman and then Bryer,

who is waiting in his car outside the multi-unit townhouse

where she keeps her office.

She doesn't notice him as she passes and enters a TOWNCAR.

She's about half-way into the car when he approaches.

She closes the door and rides away. Bryer smiles in

frustration, walks back to his car.

INT. TOWNCAR - DAY

Off Ellen's face as she tries to keep it together, shaking.

INT. JULIE'S LOFT - DAY

EXT. JIMMY'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Jimmy sits across the table from Mills and Bryer. They show

Jimmy doesn't answer.

INT. SYD'S LIMO - DAY

Jimmy slides over to sit next to Robert.

Jimmy laughs, then rises and knocks on the limo's partition.

Jimmy laughs in disgust, begins to open the door.

Jimmy grabs the document and gets out. Robert stares ahead

into space. His CELLPHONE RINGS.

INT. MILLER CAPITAL - ACCOUNTANT'S OFFICE - DAY

Brooke sits alone in the accountant's office we saw earlier.

She reviews SPREADSHEETS on his COMPUTER and compares them

with PRINTOUTS from a FILE CABINET that she has broken open.

Numbers from the screen reflect across her reading glasses as

she stares in disbelief. She DIALS a number.

She's looking at an entry on the screen:

"Miller Capital Management - PETER MILLER GROUP - $68.3MM"

Brooke taps the keyboard and a PRINTER spits out pages.

Suddenly, BEN (40s), an accountant we saw earlier, appears.

Brooke bolts up, startled. She collects the papers she

printed.

83 You tell me. 83

Mills drops another FOLDER on the table.

He puts down the sheet and leans back.

INT. FREMAUT - VOGLER'S OFFICE HALLWAY - LATER

Robert storms the hallway, passing a waiting SECRETARY.

He brushes past her.

INT. VOGLER'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Robert thinks... and starts LAUGHING. Chris looks at him

strangely as he walks out.

EXT. FREMAUT - DAY

Robert exits the building with what looks to be, for the

first time in the film, a real smile.

He walks towards his limo, DIALS his cell.

INT. COURTHOUSE HALL - AFTERNOON

Bryer walks with DEFERLITO (48), who rifles through a FOLDER.

Deferlito stops, stares, then signs the ARREST WARRANT.

He walks off. Bryer holds a beat, then pulls out his CELL.

INT. ROBERT'S OFFICE CORRIDOR - LATER

Robert enters, moving much slower. As he approaches Cindy, he

sees a worried look on her face.

INT. ROBERT'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Robert enters. Brooke's at the window in a chair. It's clear

that she has been crying.

Brooke holds out her hands. She has two copies of the "Old

Hill Fund" balance sheets.

Robert stands there a moment, staring at her.

EXT. 5TH AVENUE - AFTERNOON

We see Brooke and Robert from overhead like little dots as

they cross 5th Avenue towards Central Park.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK - CONTINUOUS

They walk solemnly towards a park bench in front of a lake.

Robert sits, motions to Brooke.

Because I hoped you wouldn't.

Oh, come on. You tell me the truth

now -- or I am done.

I made a bad bet.

No, you committed fraud.

That's a dangerous word, Brooke.

What would you prefer? That you

cheated? That you stole money from

people who trusted you? That you

lied? That you lied right to my

face? Why?

Because we were going broke!

Everything was finished. We'd have

nothing.

How. How does that happen?

You remember Alexanderov? Well he

came to see me one day last year.

He said "Robert, we've got a great

opportunity- there's a copper mine,

it's in Russia, it's under-

exploited- there's billions under

the ground, and to get it out, all

we need is a couple hundred

million, you put in a hundred,

we'll put in a hundred- we'll

triple it all in six months." So, I

go check it out. And the geological

survey's right, friendly

government. And to lock it in, you

hedge it, right? Sell the copper

ahead on the commodities exchange

and it all works, it's fine, and

you're making a fortune.

But then there's something I hadn't

accounted for-- variation margin--

and that friendly Russian

government all of a sudden not so

friendly anymore and they're

blocking the export of the copper

so I gotta make it up, I gotta put

the cash in to cover the hedge. But

I'm not worried about it because

it's still springing money, there's

so much money coming out of the

ground you can't believe. You can't

stop it. And, yes, I'm the oracle,

I've done housing, I've arb'd

credit swaps, I have done it all,

and yes, again, I know it's outside

the charter, but it is FUCKING

MINTING MONEY! IT'S A LICENSE TO

PRINT MONEY! FOR EVERYBODY!

FOREVER! IT IS GOD!...

Until...

Until it's not... The money's

trapped. You can't get it out.

Probably never will.

It's like a plane crash. It just happens.

Well it does not just happen.

Not just happen, honey you are so

naive sometimes. It HAPPENS. And

like every father I pray that it

doesn't HAPPEN to you, which,

thanks to me, it probably won't

happen to you...

Thanks to you, we may all be arrested.

Nobody's getting arrested. That's why

I borrowed the money from Jeffrey.

Plug the hole, I put it there for a

month, they see the books are fine, I

transfer the company, I pay back

Jeffrey-- with interest!-- make all

of our investors whole, and what's

left we keep. At least we get to keep

the house.

They pass a moment in silence. He looks at her destroyed

expression.

She sits.

She walks off.

Hold on Robert alone in the park.

EXT. JIMMY'S APARTMENT - DUSK

Jimmy approaches the building. Bryer exits his sedan and

walks over to him.

Jimmy considers, gets into Bryer's car.

INT. SEDAN - DRIVING

They drive a while in silence.

Jimmy thumbs through the FOLDER. There's no tollbooth PHOTO.

Jimmy's silent.

Bryer pulls the car over.

Jimmy grabs at the door violently. It's locked.

Bryer unlocks the door. Jimmy exits and walks up the block.

INT. ROBERT'S OFFICE - LATER THAT NIGHT

a COMPUTER. Robert sits with Syd in the next room.

Robert stands and collects PAPERS into his BRIEFCASE.

They sit in silence.

INT. CRIMINAL COURT - FELONY INDICTMENTS - THE NEXT DAY

We see Jimmy in the witness box before 23 GRAND JURORS. The

prosecutor, DeFerlito, asks questions. Earl Monroe sits next

to Jimmy.

Jimmy stares at DeFerlito.

DeFerlito turns and walks back to the prosecutor's table. He

picks up a PHOTOGRAPH and hands it to a CLERK.

Jimmy stares at the photograph in disbelief.

Jimmy's still staring at the picture. Earl watches, concerned.

INT. GRAND JURY COURT HALL - LATER

Jimmy bursts out of the courtroom doors trailed by Earl.

Before Earl can finish responding, Bryer exits and walks over

to them.

Jimmy doesn't answer. Bryer sits down next to them.

Earl stares at Jimmy, waiting. The bell RINGS.

Jimmy's silent. Bryer shakes his head and walks off.

Bryer and Earl enter the courtroom.

Jimmy, as he stares out the 11th floor window towards

Brooklyn. In the distance, the Woolworth building.

INT. FRANK CAMPBELL FUNERAL HOME - DAY

About thirty people in a room too big for them. At the front

are tasteful flower BOUQUETS surrounding Julie's CASKET.

Robert enters and spots some of the people from the art

opening, including Julie's gallery assistant. She looks at

him quietly, then quickly looks away.

There is no organized service; people are just walking up to

the casket and saying prayers. Robert takes his place and

holds a moment at the casket.

The gallery assistant comes up behind him.

A beautiful woman in her 50's, SANDRINE, sits crying. Robert

approaches as she stands.

Sandrine starts to tear. Robert moves in and HUGS her, hard.

Hold on Sandrine's face, in pain.

INT. ROBERT'S MANSION - GYM - MORNING

Close on Brooke's legs, running on a treadmill. Ellen

exercises on a STAIRMASTER next to her. We hear the sound of

Ellen's small talk begin to fade in.

Brooke stabs "Stop" on the machine, quickly cooling down.

Ellen stops her machine.

Ellen crosses closer to Brooke blocking her exit.

Ellen grabs Brooke and hugs her hard. Brooke hugs back,

kissing her mother on the cheek, tearing.

Hold on Ellen alone as Brooke exits.

INT. SHERRY NETHERLAND HOTEL - RESTAURANT - DAY

JAMES MAYFIELD (50s) waits alone at a table. Robert enters.

They shake hands, then sit.

Excuse me...?

FUCK - YOU. I'm the Oracle of

Gracie Square. You came to me. I

did not come to you.

Robert, I think we're getting off

on the wrong foot...

No, no, no. Forget it, forget it...

Forget the deal. I don't even care

about the deal. No, I run a

comfortable -- excuse me -- I run a

THRIVING business, that has returned

year-to-date 15.4% percent to our

investors, or approximately $583

Million dollars from a trading

operation that you don't have and

that we both know that you need, or

else you never would've called me in

the first place. You on the other

hand, you've taken a salary of

18 Million?

And what have you delivered? A

falling stock price of negative 14

dollars? Is that what it is? You've

also lost approximately... THREE AND

A HALF BILLION FOR YOUR INVESTORS-

TELL ME -- WHY - THE FUCK - DO I -

NEED YOU?

Let's just calm down...

...so we issue a press release today,

say there is no deal, never was a

deal. You're not gonna be buying Old

Hill, you're not gonna be buying

Quantum- you're not gonna be buying

anything; You? You're just a browser.

Now, me? I'll continue to enjoy my

earnings, and while I SOAR on princely

wings, to my next winning enterprise,

your stock drops another couple bucks

on yet another - failed - acquisition

- attempt. Bodes well for your tenure,

doesn't it?

Robert stands.

Robert pulls out a pen and jots down the deal points they

have just outlined onto the paper menu.

Mayfield thinks a moment, then reaches over and signs the menu.

Robert does the same and then folds it into his pocket.

As Robert stands to go, he clutches his bruised rib.

Robert turns back to the table.

Mayfield shrugs and returns to his paper. Robert walks out of

the restaurant, beaming.

INT. MILLER CAPITAL - CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

Peter, Gavin, and many of the various STAFF we have met are

gathered around a long conference table. Robert stands at the

front of the room.

They all clap as Gavin and Robert exit the room.

Gavin walks off. Robert's cell RINGS.

EXT. JIMMY'S APARTMENT - DUSK

Robert heads through a dark service entrance towards a

buzzer, then down a long hallway.

INT. JIMMY'S APARTMENT

Reina, Jimmy's girlfriend (24, Hispanic) stands at the door

with Robert and Jimmy. She turns and heads to the bedroom.

Jimmy heads to the kitchen.

Jimmy starts running the tap. Robert notices the moving BOXES.

Jimmy returns with the water. Robert take a drink.

I told you not to take the toll.

Yes, you did.

I said "Listen to what I have to

tell you and follow my directions,

listen to me closely, do the

following just like I say."

Yes. You said all that.

But you took the toll anyway.

No, I did not.

Come on, Jimmy, don't fucking lie

to me...

I'm not lying! I took ninety-five all

the Goddamn way there. I did what you

said: I didn't stop. I didn't take

the Triborough. I followed all your

fucking instructions.

So where'd they get the photograph from?

You tell me.

So, you're saying... it's a fake?

How'd you get so fuckin' rich again?

Don't be such a wiseass...

Hey, this is my fuckin' life, man!

Earl's telling me it could be ten

years? Ten fucking years! How much

are ten years worth, Robert?

Look man, I told you, I ain't no fuckin

snitch, but this is bad. This is real

bad. Reina and I got a whole plan we're

about to make happen next week!

What plan?

I got money saved up; I'm buying a business.

What business?

I bought an Applebee's.

What's an Applebee's?

It's a fucking restaurant, man, it's

a chain restaurant.

You bought an Applebee's in Virginia?

Is this really what you came here to

talk about? What are you gonna do?

It's not really that simple, Jimmy.

I'm in a situation now.

What situation?

I told you... right now, if I were to

speak, a lot of people would get hurt.

Jobs, families. A lot of innocent

people. Do you think you can

understand that?

Yeah but what about me? What about my

situation?

They showed me pictures, man;

that's fucked up what you did.

Jimmy nods. Robert walks out. Reina crosses back into the

living room as he approaches the door and exits.

Reina crosses to Jimmy and hugs him as he starts to cry, then

wipes away his tears.

INT. ROBERT'S LIMO - NIGHT

The limo drives down Fifth Avenue. Robert's on the phone.

Robert hangs up. He stares out the window at Central Park.

INT. ROBERT'S MANSION - NIGHT

He enters the foyer and ascends the steps to his bedroom.

INT. ROBERT'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

No Ellen. He looks at his watch: "8:34PM."

He moves over towards the bed and dials the tableside PHONE.

He clicks off and DIALS another number, hears Ellen's voice

mail come on the line, and hangs up.

He exhales and lies down on the bed in his clothes, staring

at the ceiling. He lies motionless a moment.

And then he sits up, thinks, and shakes his head.

He quickly picks up the phone, stabbing at the keys.

EXT. TRIBOROUGH BRIDGE - NIGHT

A steady stream of CARS passes through the toll. We follow a

BLUE LEXUS as it approaches the far right lane.

INT. LEXUS - SAME

Earl Monroe pays the TOLL CLERK through the window, getting a

RECEIPT. Then he pulls his car to the side of the road, parking

at a BUILDING labelled "Port Authority - Administration."

121 Syd slumps back. They keep staring at nothing. 121

Earl nods.

Syd lays the PHOTOGRAPH we saw earlier of Jimmy's car going

through the toll onto the counter next to the one Earl has

just placed there.

Robert picks up a high-end MAGNIFYING GLASS and leans over to

look at the two photos.

He scans the photograph of Earl's car, moving slowly

through it left-to-right.

Then he scans the photograph of Jimmy's car, passing left-to-

right until --

He passes back by the license plate area and stops --

The lines around the license plate of Jimmy's car are all

slightly-pixelated.

He switches back to the plate on Earl's car. The lines are

fine. Back to Jimmy's. Pixelated.

Robert puts down the magnifier, straightens, and smiles.

Earl's dark laugh cackles across the soundtrack as we

INT. JUDGE'S CHAMBERS - THE NEXT DAY

Earl sits across from DA Deferlito and Bryer. JUDGE

RITTENBAND reviews both TOLL PHOTOS with a MAGNIFYING GLASS.

A beat.

Silence. Rittenband leans forward.

Deferlito gets up angrily, huffs past Bryer.

Bryer closes it. The judge holds up the toll photos.

No response.

INT. COURTHOUSE HALL - MOMENTS LATER

Mills waits on a nearby bench, watching as Bryer exits the

chambers dialing his phone. DeFerlito walks up to Bryer, and

grabs him. Bryer breaks free, aggressively, phone to his ear.

Mills approaches. Bryer waves him away.

EXT. OUTDOOR COFFEE SHOP - AFTERNOON

Robert and Jimmy sit. Jimmy looks at the TRUST DOCUMENT.

Jimmy keeps staring at the document.

He thinks a moment, then folds the document and puts it in

his pocket.

Hold on Jimmy.

INT. ROBERT'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Ellen is dressed in a full BALL GOWN. She sits at on the sofa

finishing a drink.

Robert enters and begins changing into a TUXEDO.

She doesn't say anything. He waits a moment, then...

He slows... Something's brewing.

He doesn't move.

She stands and heads towards him. Then she hits him with a a

NEWSPAPER, right at his broken rib.

He winces a little, then looks down at the floor.

It's the Post article chronicling Julie's death.

Did you tell her about that?

Ellen I don't know what you think

you know...

Oh, don't treat me like an idiot.

You've been sneaking off to see her for

months. You don't think I know that?

What do you think you know?

I never cared, really, about your

secretaries, your- gallerists,

whores, whatever you wanna call them.

I cared about our home. And now you

have brought this to our door.

I did what was necessary.

No you did what was necessary for

you, Robert, for your interests.

For my interests?

Yes.

Everything I do is for us, for this

family, and now you're gonna tell

me how to run my business.

This isn't about your business,

this is our life! Where do you

think we're going tonight? Why do

you think I've even tolerated this

for so long?

What you've tolerated? Wow!

I'm glad you find that funny.

She opens a FOLDER revealing some legal documents, slides

them toward him.

He crosses to the bed and puts on his glasses. We see the

title: "SEPARATION AGREEMENT" and hold on him reading for a

few brief seconds until...

A beat.

He stares at her, trying to make it work, but he can't.

We hold on Robert's face. PRE-LAP Bill Evans' "My Foolish Heart."

INT. MAYFIELD'S LIMO - NIGHT

The car rides up Madison Avenue. Mayfield marks up a bunch of

memos in a leather-bound folder. An aide we met earlier, JOHN

AIMES, sits nearby.

Aimes opens a FOLDER, handing it to Mayfield.

We catch a glimpse of the top sheet as Mayfield reads:

"STERN MARLING CONFIDENTIAL AUDIT - MILLER CAPITAL - We have

reviewed the records you submitted and have found no way to

legitimately substantiate a recent capital transfer of $412

Million..."

We hold on Mayfield's face as he tries hard to conceal the

spreading realization.

Mayfield closes the folder and places it with the rest of his

papers. Aimes nods.

EXT. PLAZA HOTEL

They arrive at the Plaza Hotel and exit the car

INT. PLAZA HOTEL - GRAND BALLROOM - NIGHT

We see throngs of the wealthy ascend the steps leading up to

the opulent hall. Lining the walls are plaques for:

"Mt. Sinai Hospital - Miller Oncology Center."

INT. GRAND BALLROOM - LATER

Seated at one of the many round tables are Robert, Ellen,

Peter, Gavin, Syd, Jeffrey, and a few spouses and attendants.

Chamber MUSIC plays while everyone eats dinner.

We focus in on Robert as he stares intently out into the

room, his eyes a mixture of ferocity and resignation. In the

distance, we hear a SPEAKER'S voice fade in. It's Brooke.

Robert stands against deafening APPLAUSE as he makes his way

to the stage and, in one continuous shot, gives Brooke a hug,

takes the podium, opens his notes, and begins to talk.
