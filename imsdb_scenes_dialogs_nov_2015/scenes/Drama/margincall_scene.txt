INT. ERIC DALE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

ERIC DALE is sitting at his desk, he is 52 years old and

looks exhausted. He looks out through the glass of his office

as she walks over to the door.

ERIC walks out the door first.

INT. TRADING FLOOR - CONTINUOUS

They walk along the full length of the trading floor to reach

one of the conference rooms. Everyone left on the floor is

watching.

INT. TRADING FLOOR MEETING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

There is a more senior looking Human Resources lawyer, LAUREN

BRATBERG, already sitting at the table. They all sit and look

at each other for a beat.

SARAH does not respond.

This time she looks up. When she sees him she debates if she

should stop. She does. He slowly moves a little closer to

her, still carrying the slightly tattered box with his

personal belongings in it.

They stare at each other.

They look at each other for a longer beat, both a little

shocked that ERIC was so openly confrontational. She turns

and heads back inside quickly. ERIC drops the phone to the

ground and walks away.

INT. TRADING FLOOR - EVENING

Most of the remaining traders are packing up and getting

ready to go home or out for the night. PETER is sitting at

his desk holding the portable hard drive. SETH is getting

ready to leave behind him. PETER stares down at the drive in

his hand trying to decide whether to proceed.

SETH walks out and PETER puts on his headphones, the MUSIC

kicks in again. He picks up the portable hard drive, looks

around and sees no one, then inserts it into his computer. He

has four large screens in front of him and as he begins

opening window upon window of mathematical models his face

begins to soften and he gets into his comfort zone. The frame

is filled with the extremely complex programs and numbers

flying by.

INT. VETERINARIANS OFFICE ANIMAL VISITATION ROOM - NIGHT

SAM is sitting next to the exam table, his dog is on the

table lying down very sedated. They both stare forward.

INT. THE SOHO GRAND BAR - NIGHT

In a locked off shot SETH and WILL are sitting on a couch

staring forward. Figures cross frame and occasionally another

banker in the group stops to refill his drink with one of the

three bottles in ice buckets on the table in front of them.

They are celebrating, but it seems a little forced.

INT. INVESTMENT BANK TRADING FLOOR - NIGHT

PETER is still working on the numbers, although his face

starts to carry a more serious look. He is now wearing

glasses and the numbers on the screen are reflected in them.

The numbers finally stop moving on the screen and then he

takes his glasses off and rubs his eyes.

INT. VETERINARIANS OFFICE ANIMAL VISITATION ROOM

SAM is still sitting next to his dog on the exam table.

INT. TRADING FLOOR

PETER is still in front of his computer, he puts his glasses

back on, looks at the screen then quickly picks up the phone

and dials.

PETER hangs up the phone. He looks back at the screen. Then

picks up the phone again and dials.

INT. BAR - INTERCUT

INT. BAR HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS/INTERCUT

INT. MAIN TRADING FLOOR- FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER

SETH and WILL walk through the door and into the empty main

trading floor. The lights are down and there is a cleaning

person vacuuming in the far background. They walk over to

PETER'S desk.

WILL is a bit drunk but SETH looks at PETER'S face and

realizes something is up.

SETH comes around and sits at PETER'S desk.

SETH looks at the screen and starts to scroll through the

pages.

WILL is now paying closer attention, standing over their

shoulder.

PETER starts scrolling back through the last couple weeks on

his screen

SETH scrolls the final page on the graph.

They all look at each other long and hard.

WILL starts off towards his office and is suddenly quite

sober. PETER and SETH follow him.

INT. WILL EMERSON'S OFFICE

WILL looks at PETER and SETH standing in front of his desk.

The phone starts ringing. We never see Mrs. Dale but we can

just make out her responses through the receiver.

Will hangs up the phone.

Will writes the address on a piece of paper. Hands it to

them.

INT. SAM ROGERS' CAR-10:45 PM

SAM ROGERS is driving in his car home from the vet trying to

stay awake when his Blackberry starts ringing next to him. He

looks down at it, then out to the road, then decides to

answer.

INT. WILL EMERSON'S OFFICE - INTERCUT

WILL'S last words hang in the air.

INT. BACKSEAT OF A BLACK LINCOLN TOWN CAR

SETH and PETER sit in the back of the plush car as it

struggles through traffic up town. SETH reaches into his bag

and pulls out a large beer in a black paper bag. Their

conversation is quiet, as if they are afraid someone might be

listening.

PETER gives him a bit of a look.

PETER looks out the window at all the people on the street

enjoying the Thursday night.

SETH'S demeanor sitting and drinking a beer doesn't seem to

project much in the way of stress.

PETER continues to look out the window in silence for a long

beat. Then with a little sly humor and a smile to SETH:

SETH'S phone starts playing a ring tone. He looks down at the

text.

INT. TRADING FLOOR

SAM ROGERS comes through the door from the elevator looking

quite disheveled and walks across the long and empty trading

floor. He looks around, then heads over to WILL EMERSON'S

office where the light is on.

INT. WILL EMERSON'S OFFICE-CONTINUOUS

SAM lightly knocks on the glass.

SAM looks at WILL for some hint of what is going on, then

eventually puts his coat down and sits into a chair. They

wait for who goes first.

WILL gives him a long pause.

WILL'S look gets SAM up and he comes over to stand behind

WILL at his desk and look at the computer.

WILL takes his finger and points at a red number with a whole

lot of zeroes after it. SAM'S look says it all.

INT. UPSCALE CABARET CLUB ON THE UPPER EAST SIDE- CONTINUOUS 25

PETER and SETH are sitting at the bar each with a drink

facing camera. There are women dancing in the background and

one dancing in front of them, PETER and SETH look up

occasionally.

They both just continue to look forward and sip their drinks.

PETER keeps looking forward.

Eventually SETH'S phone starts to ring. He picks it up.

They exchange a look and slam their drinks.

EXT. THE TOWNCAR IN TRAFFIC

This time they are really stuck in traffic, the car is not

moving at all.

INT. BACKSEAT OF A BLACK LINCOLN TOWNCAR

Eventually the car starts moving, and SETH'S phone starts

buzzing with a text again.

They look out into the city. Finally SETH reaches into his

bag and takes out the forty in the paper bag and starts

drinking the beer again. He takes a big sip.

Long pause.

SETH looks at him showing he is serious.

They both just look straight forward, SETH takes a big gulp

of the beer.

INT. TRADING FLOOR ELEVATOR BANK- FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER

The doors of the elevator open and PETER and SETH look up as

WILL EMERSON and SAM ROGERS are standing in front of them

about to get onto the elevator. WILL and SAM are now dressed

with fresh shirts, ties, and suits and look as if they are

ready to start a new day even though it is almost one in the

morning. SETH is still holding the forty in the paper bag.

Will looks at it. They share a glancing smile. WILL and SAM

step into the elevator keeping the guys in it.

INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

They all stand in silence as the elevator heads up until:

PETER and SETH look at each other, growing more concerned.

The doors open and they exit.

INT. HALLWAY BY JARED'S CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

SETH looks for somewhere to throw out his beer but can't find

a trash can. They follow SAM and WILL down a long hallway

that is crowded with assistant cubicles. Eventually they turn

into a small conference room that has no windows. It is

claustrophobic.

INT. JARED'S CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

There are four people sitting at the table. They stand.

Everyone says their somber hellos and shakes hands.

They all sit down and at each place setting there is a pad of

paper, a pencil, and an empty binder. Sitting at the head of

the table is JARED COHEN. He is a blond boyish looking 43

year old, although carries himself with intense confidence.

He is the head of all fixed income securities, and oversees

roughly 25,000 employees. Next to him is his chief risk

management officer, SARAH ROBERTSON, the same woman from

outside the building earlier who had the run in with ERIC.

Next to her is her right hand man RAMESH SHAH, a sixty year

old number cruncher and next to him is a firm lawyer. They

are all dressed sharply for a new day. Long silence.

SETH COUGHS.

ALL PRESENT look down at him.

JARED COHEN looks at SARAH ROBERTSON as it would have been

her call to let ERIC go, she nods yes.

Everyone looks down the table at PETER and SETH. Their

inexperience glares back.

JARED looks back at SARAH, then the room goes silent again.

Finally a COPY ROOM STAFFER knocks on the door.

The COPY ROOM GUY hands out the packets to everyone in the

room.

JARED COHEN and the others open up the printout in front of

them and start reviewing. SAM, WILL, PETER, and SETH just sit

in awkward silence staring at the other side of the table as

they all read. This goes on for a full very long minute.

Finally:

Long silence.

The whole table looks over at Peter with some awe.

JARED looks down again at the numbers in front of him and his

tone suddenly switches to serious, testy even.

SAM and JARED just look at each other in silence for a bit.

RAMESH looks down at the sheet in front of him to go through

the numbers and takes a beat too long.

RAMESH checks his number.

JARED looks over at SARAH and RAMESH. SARAH then looks to

RAMESH. She looks back.

Jared stands up and walks around the small room. The rest of

the room goes silent. Finally:

RAMESH has been looking down at the numbers while this

conversation has been taking place.

JARED holds up a hand to interrupt Ramesh. Jared nods his

head, his eyes are perfectly still but his brain is racing.

JARED calmly stands up   and steps out of the   room for a long

moment. The room stays   completely quiet the   whole time he is

gone. We hear nothing.   It is awkward to say   the least. He

comes back in and sits   down without missing   a beat.

Pause.

JARED turns around suddenly and cuts him off.

They stand up and start to exit the room.

PETER thinks that through.

WILL, SETH, and PETER leave the room and close the door

behind them.

INT. CORNER OUTSIDE JARED'S CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

They cross the hallway and sit on a bench staring out the

window. They talk very quietly.

They all look out the window. Long pause.

INT. JARED'S CONFERENCE ROOM

JARED COHEN comes back over to the table and picks up the

packet.

SARAH now cuts him off abruptly.

SARAH closes the issue off with another look to JARED.

SAM slides him the hard drive across the table, they all take

a second to follow it.

SARAH and RAMESH leave the room as SAM is left alone with

JARED.

They both look at each other for a long beat. Finally.

SAM puts his hand on JARED'S shoulder briefly. They part.

OMITTED

EXT. ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS

They walk over towards the edge. It is a very clear night.

They sit down on a girder, then light up. WILL'S look and

tone becomes a little darker as they all stare out into the

night. Long Pause.

INT. JARED'S FLOOR ELEVATOR BANK

SARAH and JARED wait for the elevator alone in silence. The

doors finally open and they get in.

INT. ELEVATOR- CONTINUOUS

Still not a word. Finally.

Silence except for the ding as it comes to the floor and the

doors open.

They part.

EXT. ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS

THEY are all still smoking and looking out over the city.

Finally WILL stands up and goes over to the edge and looks

over. He jumps up and sits on the edge.

WILL jumps down and comes back over to sit down. They stare

out again.

Long silence.

WILL EMERSON takes a long drag off his cigarette.

With that he flicks his cigarette over the edge of the

building just as a massive CORPORATE HELICOPTER comes

sweeping up from behind the building and comes right over

their heads.

THEY are now YELLING above the rotor noise.

Whoa!                               Whoa!

INT. JARED COHEN'S CORNER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

JARED and SAM are sitting in the office silently looking out

the window. The office is very large and has a full sitting

area with two couches. JARED is intensely going over the

papers in front of him. SAM is just looking out the window.

JARED stops reading with a deeply aware look and just stares

out the window as well.

SAM looks over at him directly.

SARAH ROBERTSON comes to the door. SAM sits up.

Her look says it all.

They all look at each other as if they have seen a ghost.

SAM stares at them both.

He walks out of the room. SARAH and JARED look each other

over.

They both stare at each other. Jared's phone buzzes. He takes

it out and his face says it all.

His face says yes. Sarah walks out. Jared stands up and

straightens his tie in the reflection of the window. He

exits.

INT. OUTSIDE JARED'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Tracking shot of Sarah and Jared walking through cubicles.

They cut through a short cut near the freight elevator. WILL,

PETER, and SETH are coming down the stairway from the roof.

JARED ushers the whole group towards the conference room.

INT. OTHER HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

All five walk in silence. Finally,

He continues on.

INT. ELEVATOR BANK OUTSIDE JARED'S CONFERENCE ROOM -

CONTINUOUS

The guys are taken aback because standing right outside the

opening elevator door is a very well dressed page and a

female executive assistant who is also dressed perfectly for

the day ahead.

INT. CEO'S EXECUTIVE BOARDROOM - CONTINUOUS

They come through glass doors and enter a massive conference

room with a commanding view of the city. It is filled with

people along one side of the table. There are a team of five

lawyers, three compliance officers, a couple of key board

members, twelve in all. On the near side of the table sits

RAMESH SHAH surrounded by empty chairs all alone. The head of

the table is empty.

They all file in and sit down. They all sit in silence...

waiting. Finally from a side door JOHN TULD comes walking

into the room. He is dressed in a average suit and tie, is

not tall, late fifties and doesn't have a hair on his head.

He carries himself without much exception. His eyes however

tell a far different tale. Intense even at rest. He walks the

length of the room, everyone half stands up.

He then seats himself at the head of the table. Everyone in

the room has the printout in front of them. JARED is seated

immediately to his left, then SAM, then SARAH, RAMESH, WILL,

PETER, and finally SETH.

Everyone looks around the room a bit and finally JARED speaks

up.

He cuts him off.

JARED looks down the table to PETER, as does everyone else in

the room. JARED gives him a go ahead look.

PETER is very nervous.

PETER looks down at JARED for approval to go forward.

The room goes silent. JOHN TULD looks at PETER long and hard.

He then stands up and goes over to the window and looks into

the city.

Everyone looks back at PETER.

JOHN TULD continues to look out over the city for a long

beat.

The room falls completely still for at least half a minute.

Then JOHN TULD spins around quickly with a considerably more

upbeat tone and looks up and down the table.

Long Silence.

JARED and SARAH come to attention and gather their thoughts.

Long pause.

The room goes silent again as Mr. Tuld stares back out the

window.

JOHN TULD smiles just a bit. Then turns.

SAM looks across the room at JOHN TULD, they have known each

other for 35 years.

JOHN and SAM look and read each other.

SAM ROGERS looks down at the table for a long, long, beat.

He looks to RAMESH SHAH down the table.

They look at each other to see if they understand each other.

The rest of the table is taken aback and just watching them

go at it. Silence.

INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

This pushes a button with her.

The elevator door opens and the housekeeper gets off. Sarah

walks after her, but turns to Tuld first.

SARAH looks at him trying to judge the situation.

INT. JARED'S FLOOR ELEVATOR BANK - CONTINUOUS

SARAH holds the door open.

Jared looks at her for a long beat.

The doors close.

INT. WILL EMERSON'S OFFICE

WILL is sitting at his desk with a large plate of food

eating. SETH and PETER are sitting on the couch. SETH is

stuffing food in his mouth while PETER eats nothing.

WILL speaks with food in his mouth.

Peter exits. Will's phone rings. Will stares at it and

finally picks it up. We only hear his part of the

conversation.

SAM comes to the door of WILL'S office. He looks at

everyone's faces.

They all look to SAM to see what to do.

SAM ROGERS looks at his watch.

SAM points to WILL and SETH.

INT. SARAH ROBERTSON'S OFFICE

SARAH is sitting behind her desk looking down at something.

JOHN TULD comes to the door and knocks lightly. She looks up

surprised to see him.

JOHN TULD closes the door and sits in front of her desk.

Looks around, then looks right at her.

TULD pauses.

SARAH looks up.

They stare at each other, she does not flinch.

TULD pauses, they look at each other.

JOHN TULD looks at her. There is a security person standing

at the door who is waiting for her as he gets up and walks

out.

INT. PARKING GARAGE, BASEMENT OF OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT

WILL and SETH are sitting waiting for WILL'S car to be

brought up. As they wait they see JARED COHEN come out of the

elevator and walk towards them.

WILL stands up and walks over to JARED.

THEY walk away from SETH.

WILL looks around the garage, than back at JARED.

They look at each other for a long beat as WILL sizes up the

question. In the background the squeals of tires on concrete

are heard.

As the question stands unfinished Will's convertible flies

into frame down a ramp and pulls up next to JARED and WILL.

The attendant gets out and before WILL has a chance JARED

hands the attendant a tip. JARED then looks back at WILL who

is waiting to get in the car.

WILL climbs into the car and shuts the door. He looks at

JARED through the open window with SETH now sitting next to

him within earshot.

WILL puts the car in drive and pulls out of the garage

leaving JARED standing there.

INT. TRADING FLOOR - MORNING

The floor is totally empty. Slow guitar music playing. The

camera glides along the empty floor scanning over the many

different empty trading stations and the hundreds of computer

screens. It turns the corner and then finally enters SAM'S

office.

INT. SAM'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

He is totally asleep. He has headphones on and looks like he

could be dead he is so passed out. The music suddenly changes

pace and the volume change startles him up. He looks around.

JOHN TULD is now taking a far more forceful stance, almost

blocking the doorway.

He stares at SAM.

They both stare at each other.

SAM looks down at the floor then at the piece of paper in his

hand, then long and hard at JOHN TULD.

SAM slightly moves JOHN out of the way and then he exits, the

door closes.

EXT. CITY STREETS - MORNING

There is a haunting blue light bouncing through the

buildings. PETER is walking through the streets with mid-size

headphones on his ears. The music is all we hear. He wanders

around the almost completely empty city and the further he

walks the less his face changes.

EXT. CITY STREET - STREET CART - MORNING

PETER finally stops to get a coffee at a small street cart.

He takes off his headphones to pay and the music stops. The

wind blows.

PETER turns around and starts walking but as he looks up he

see the figure of a woman coming towards him. It is

immediately obvious that he knows her. He stops and she keeps

slowly walking towards him. They stop in front of each other

squarely.

She has a very sweet face but looks tired. She appears to be

a bartender or something, she is not dressed for banking.

This cuts him a bit, why wouldn't he be?

She is pleasantly surprised by this gesture.

He starts to leave.

This stops PETER dead in his tracks. His world tightens yet

clarifies. Finally.

She looks at him with concern as he doesn't even hint at a

smile as he says this. They then give a small kiss on the

cheek, and part.

INT. SARAH ROBERTSON'S OFFICE - DAY

SARAH is sitting at her desk staring out the window. She

calmly gets up and walks over to the door and slowly closes

it. Then she reaches out and twists the blinds on the glass

wall separating her office from the floor giving herself

total privacy. She walks over to her desk and sits down. She

reaches over and grabs a box of tissues, methodically

preparing to cry, almost like a surgeon preparing to work.

She sits at her desk still seemingly calm and collected. Her

face starts to tweak just a little, but it just will not give

way. Again she tries. And again. She can not cry. She can't

believe it. The deeply tragic look of total failure floods

her eyes but still hardly a twitch on her face. Still no

tears. Finally she makes a forced noise like a sob, but it

isn't real and she knows it. Then she tries to laugh to

herself, she tries again to laugh, but it too is not real.

She does feel something, but she simply and very sadly can

only openly express even to herself... nothing.

I/E. WILL'S CONVERTIBLE - ERIC'S TOWNHOUSE - DAY

WILL and SETH pull up in front of a very nice large

townhouse. They both look up at the house dreading going in.

EXT. ERIC DALE'S TOWNHOUSE IN BROOKLYN HEIGHTS - DAY

WILL gets out of the car and walks slowly up the stairs. He

is about to knock on the door when from behind him he hears

ERIC coming walking up the block. He is still in his work

clothes and it looks like it's been a long night.

They both sit down on the stoop.

ERIC looks over at Will

ERIC'S face doesn't show much emotion. But he is surprised

and sincere.

WILL lets it sit for a few beats.

ERIC looks over at WILL. WILL lets him know with a look that

they mean real money.

ERIC looks back out onto the empty street.

Now ERIC'S mind is racing and he is adding up numbers as he

goes.

They sit and let it sink in.

WILL looks out down the street as a black towncar comes

pulling up to the house.

ERIC drops his head.

WILL walks down the stairs as the town car stops in front of

Eric's house. The windows are tinted, but they know who it

is. WILL walks around to his car.

WILL is about to climb in his car.

ERIC nods.

He gets in his car and drives away.

INT. WILL EMERSON'S CONVERTIBLE - DAY

WILL and SETH are driving slowly towards downtown Manhattan

which spans up and out in front of them through the

windshield. There is a long silence, and finally.

Very long pause, then he looks over at SETH and decides

whether to tell the truth.

This clearly hits SETH but he recovers quickly.

SETH looks over at WILL and around at the interior of the

luxury car and then back into the city.

He thinks that through.

WILL looks out again at the city then to SETH.

This line sits there for a minute and WILL looks out onto the

city.

WILL looks over at SETH, sizing him up, looking to see if he

has what it takes.

Long look out at the city ahead.

He is trying to convince himself as much as SETH. They both

look out the windows.

WILL looks into the sea of skyscrapers that now tower above

them.

EXT. STREET LEVEL PLAZA - DAY

PETER is still walking around on the street with the music

playing. He crosses a large open windswept corporate plaza.

As he approaches the building he sees SAM ROGERS standing in

front having a cigarette. He walks towards him and then

finally decides to take off the headphones. The music stops

and the wind kicks in.

But PETER holds his place comfortably.

They both look out. Slow pacing.

Long silence.

SAM looks out and thinks about it for a while.

SAM looks at PETER.

Long beat.

A taxi honks and flies by.

They look at each other to check the nature of the question.

SAM ROGERS laughs quietly.

Laughs again.

Another helicopter is heard overhead landing on the building.

Peter looks up.

SAM takes a deep drag off his cigarette.

PETER looks down at his watch, then thinks about what to say

next.

Now SAM looks around and thinks.

Takes another long drag.

They both stand in place for a long beat then finally turn

and head into the building.

INT. LOBBY ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

The camera follows them through the long marble lobby.

Through security. They comfortably don't talk to each other

the entire time till they get into the elevator.

INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

Staring ahead in silence.

The doors open.

INT. EXECUTIVE BATHROOM STALL

A very tight shot of SETH sitting fully clothed on the toilet

with the lid on. He is crying very, very intensely but almost

silently. He puts his head in his hands and just once or

twice lets out a loud noise.

Eventually someone comes into the room and he hears the

person go over to the sink and start running water. SETH

tries to stop himself from crying. Eventually he accepts that

the guy is not leaving and he comes out of the stall and

walks over to the sinks. JARED is standing in front of the

mirror with his shirt off shaving. His new shirt and tie are

on a hanger next to him. SETH walks up to a sink next to him

and it is very obvious that he has been crying. He undoes his

collar and starts to wash his face. Finally JARED speaks.

SETH sends him a dagger of a look through the reflection in

the mirror.

This hits JARED just a touch.

JARED does up his tie perfectly looks at SETH again in the

eye. Then walks out.

INT. EXECUTIVE QUARANTINE ROOM - DAY

SARAH ROBERTSON is sitting in a club chair staring out the

window. The coffee table in front of her has a huge spread of

fruit and cheese and pastries. She is not eating. She sits

and stares. Eventually the door behind her opens, and a

SECURITY GUY walks in with ERIC.

SECURITY GUY leaves the room. ERIC looks over at SARAH then

sits in the chair near her. Silence.

Long awkward pause. Eric looks around for something, anything

to talk about.

She looks over at him with a slight smile, giving him credit

for trying to break the ice.

Silence.

The door swings open and a catering person comes in rolling a

cart with another large tray with more food on it. She places

it on the table next to the other food. The abundance is

overwhelming.

The caterer leaves. ERIC looks around.

SARAH nods yes.

ERIC stands up and goes over to the window.

ERIC goes back and sits in the chair.

Now SARAH questions herself.

They both look at each other with miniscule smiles, then out

the windows onto the city, defeated. Long silence.

Long pause as he lets her alone.

INT. VIP TRADING ROOM - 6:30 AM

There are 40 young, 90% male, traders jammed into the

conference room next to the trading floor talking very loudly

with one another. They are oblivious to what is about to

happen. Eventually, SAM, WILL, JARED, and a firm lawyer, come

into the room. Everyone quiets down a bit.

They go silent as they notice SAM standing at the head of the

table. JARED and the lawyer are standing off in the corner

just to observe. SAM looks somber.

THE LAWYER looks at JARED then they look at SAM, he

continues.

An assistant starts handing out info packets to each of the

traders in the room.

SAM stops for a second and looks around the room.

SAM looks around the room again, person by person and sees

that they indeed know what needs to be done.

He looks down at the ground, then back up around the room.

Then he walks out.

INT. TRADING FLOOR- 8:20 AM

There is a very quiet energy on the floor. A low murmur. Then

a hush falls over the floor as people pass on the info that

the CEO, JOHN TULD is about to come onto the floor. He

appears at one end of the floor and it falls silent. JOHN

walks dramatically into the middle of the floor and then into

the middle of the row in the dead middle of the floor. He

looks around and stands in letting the drama build. Then he

climbs up onto the desk and looks out onto the floor like a

general.

JOHN TULD climbs down from the table. SAM, who is standing

off to the side, walks along the entire floor slowly and then

heads into his office.

INT. SAM ROGER'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

He shuts his door as the bell rings and his office goes

almost silent. Through the glass you see the trading floor go

wild, then he walks over to his desk, turns around and stares

into the four large computer screens as the charts and graphs

begin to move. We just see the back of his head.

INT. INVESTMENT BANK TRADING FLOOR - DAY

Several actual individual trading sequences throughout the

day.

INT. SAM ROGER'S OFFICE - 4:02 PM

The market has closed. SAM sits, staring at his computers.

There is a knock on his door. He turns and as it opens we

hear the sober beginnings of a quiet celebration. He looks up

and JARED COHEN is standing in his doorway.

SAM stands up and walks past JARED without another word.

INT. TRADING FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY

He heads down the hallway and passes the HEATHER and LAUREN

BRATBERG from the opening scene who are returning with boxes

to lay off more people. SAM heads off towards the elevator.

INT. SENIOR EXECUTIVE DINING ROOM    - MOMENTS LATER

The room has ten tables formally set that line a long wall of

floor to ceiling windows with a commanding view of the city

beyond. The room is empty except for JOHN TULD sitting at the

last table. TULD looks a little surprised to see SAM but

waves him down. SAM approaches.

They just sit in silence for a long beat as TULD takes a few

more bites of his meal.

They look at each other, SAM seems to know it's not actually

a question. SAM is a shell of himself as TULD takes another

hearty bite of his meal. He finally looks up.

SAM pushes back his chair, stands, and prepares to leave.

This pushes TULD a bit too far. He also senses he may be

losing SAM. He drops his fork, and his tone changes.

They stare at each other for a long beat and then TULD looks

down and takes another bite. He chews. He looks up again.

They both look at each other again, then look over and see

JARED COHEN walking down the dining room aisle with PETER

SULLIVAN next to him.

They look at each other one last time then SAM starts walking

away and as he passes PETER he just gives him a slight nod.

We hear the sound of someone digging in dirt with a shovel.

EXT. VERY UPSCALE OLD GROWTH SUBURBAN NYC BACKYARD- 11:00 PM 74

Fade up on SAM ROGERS standing in a hole in the backyard

digging. Next to him is a large black medical-looking bag.

He continues to dig. Eventually the flood lights from the

house come on and the whole back yard lights up. Then the

door opens and a woman in her fifties wearing a bath robe and

slippers comes out onto the deck. It is SAM'S EX-WIFE. MARY

ROGERS. She squints towards the back of the yard.

SAM stops digging and looks up and leans on the shovel

handle.

She comes down off the deck and walks across the lawn up next

to the hole.

MARY looks down and sees the large canine body bag.

She looks at him deeply.

MARY walks back across the lawn into the house and turns off

the lights. SAM starts back in digging the ditch and starts

humming a song. He keeps digging as the song he is humming

then kicks in with the full version.
