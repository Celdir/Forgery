The ROYAL BARGE is gliding towards us, slowly taking shape:

its hull gaily painted, its canopy adorned with colourful

fabrics, its banks of oars rising and falling, casting

bright shards of shining water in the sunlight.

P

cheering. They see the Queen now. They call out.

Two young men walking arm-in-arm stare more intently than

any; but they do not cheer or wave. There's something

chilling in the way they track the distant figure of the

Queen.

They are BABINGTON and SAVAGE.

Over this an insistent voice:

Your bishops are preaching that

God is showing his displeasure-

the Queen being still unmarried -

some are saying infertile -

What nonsense!

Dangerous nonsense. Mary Stuart

has a son -

Why does everyone torment me with

Mary Stuart?

She leans over to brush a stray lock of hair from Bess's

face.

Elizabeth looks back at Wsalsingham.

9A                                                                9A

Annette reaches her mistress and kneels before her, holding

out the letter.

Mary lays down her needlework and takes the letter from her

and reads it for herself.

The chaplain gives a sharp cough of warning.

The Warden of Chartley Hall, SIR AMYAS PAULET, enters the

room. He is soberly dressed, but has charming manners, and

is clearly susceptible to his handsome ward. Mary turns to

him at once with a teasing smile.

She holds out one hand to be smacked. The other hand holds

the letter out of sight.

Mary signs to her ladies. One of them brings her the

embroidery, discreetly receiving in exchange the hidden

letter.

She holds the intimate garment against her body. Paulet

seems to be too fascinated by it to notice he is being

duped.

17                                                               17

Every Sunday the Queen processes here, and crowds gather to

see her. Two of Walsingham's men, AGENTS 1 and 2, mingle in

the crowd: faces we'll see again.

Tom Babington stands unobtrusively at the back of the

crowd. He carries a bag which may or may not contain a gun.

A

coming!' - and the palace doors open.

BABINGTON'S POV: the crowd, the wall of BODYGUARDS, the

cluster of COURTIERS and LADIES, and in their midst,

Elizabeth, almost completely masked as she passes by.

Alongside the Queen, among her maids-of-honour, is Bess

Throckmorton; behind her, Walsingham.

The people cheer, call out to the Queen, reach to touch

her, fall to their knees.

Others in the crowd are shouting more militant sentiments.

Babington moves forward, easing his way to the front of the

crowd. Nearby there stands another young man who is

watching, not cheering: RAMSAY.

A WOMAN WTH A BABY pushes her way almost to the Queen,

holding her baby before her.

BABINGTON'S POV- The Queen stopping to bless the little

baby, smiling, putting out her hand to touch the baby's

head. The mother bobs a curtsey. The Queen moves on, with

her entourage.

A sudden scuffle in the crowd. Babington turns to look.

A CLOAK SWEEPS THROUGH FRAME - dropping down to the ground -

revealing as it passes the handsome smiling face of

Raleigh, directly in R

Elizabeth signs to the guards to stay calm. She stares at

Raleigh, then she looks down at the cloak. No sign of any

puddles. Bess Throckmorton watches, suppressing a smile.

18A                                                                 18A

An architect waits to present details of a building

project. Petitioners wait vainly, in the hope of catching

the Queen's eye. Howard and Hatton are in attendance.

Walsingham stands by the Queen's side, briefing her in a

low murmur for her ears only.

A courtier is holding a portrait which he shows to the

Queen.

Howard beckons the Architect forward to show his model.

Elizabeth studies it. Walsingham murmurs on.

The courtier displays a second portrait.

The courtier presents a third portrait.

Walsingham merely shakes his head.

20                                                              20

The puddle man is outside,

majesty.

Elizabeth takes Bess's arm and turns with her to the

portraits.

The Courtier has a fourth portrait.

Elizabeth looks across at the Spaniards.

Bess understands. She bobs and hurries to the door.

Raleigh now enters with Calley, the native Americans and

court servants carrying hampers.

One of the Spaniards recognises him and murmurs to the

Ambassador; who speaks angrily to the Queen.

Don Guerau points to the hampers.

R

to rise.

Elizabeth raises her eyebrows.

A royal joke. Her entourage laughs dutifully.

E

He beckons Calley to lead Wanchese and Manteo forward.

Elizabeth gazes at the natives. She holds out her hand.

Unaware that he's meant to kiss the Queen's hand, Manteo,

takes it and shakes it. A gasp from the watching courtiers.

But Elizabeth accepts the courtesy.

Calley hurries them away before worse happens.

He beckons to the servants to bring the baskets. Don Guerau

steps forward.

R

Members of the court share suppressed smiles.

inside suspiciously. It does indeed seem to be filled with

mud.

Raleigh takes out a potato beneath the Ambassador's nose.

He beckons forward the second basket, which is full of

leaves. Again Don Guerau tracks his every move. He takes

out a tobacco leaf. R

Now Don Guerau realises he's being laughed at on all sides.

He draws himself up with angry pride, wrinkling his nose.

A glare at Raleigh, a bow for the Queen, and Don Guerau

leads his Spaniards out.

With a broad smile, Raleigh gestures forward the third

basket. This one really is full of gold. He takes out a

gold coin and presents it to Elizabeth.

Elizabeth examines the fat gold coin, with its image of

Philip of Spain. She tries not to smile.

Elizabeth drops the gold coin back into the basket.

22                                                                22

23                                                                23

Now the man turns and looks intently at Babington, and we

see he is Robert Reston; no longer in the clothes of a

priest.

Babington rises. Reston nods his approval. Babington goes

off through the trees. Reston and the others follow a

little behind.

He sings on as Babington approaches him, seeming no longer

to know what's happening. Babington takes the pistol from

his hand.

Savage stares, and suddenly realises what Babington means

to do. Terror overwhelms him.

Now he's blubbering with fear. Babington is shaken by this,

and can't shoot.

Reston begins to pray aloud.

The others join in with the words of the well-known psalm.

Babington too joins in, now weeping.

I doubt it, brother. Compromise

is out of fashion. On both sides

they say there can only be one

truth, and one God.

Sit, sit.

H

What do they say in Paris of the

Pope's call for holy war?

Many welcome it.

I don't understand why we must

all hate each other.

Truth will always hate falsehood,

ma'am.

Why do we have to talk about war?

Tell us your nice news, William.

Are you married yet?

Not yet.

Then we must find you a nice

sensible English wife.

No, no. I won't be staying long.

I must go back to my studies.

Not too soon, I hope. Every man

deserves a rest.

Listen to him! When did you last

rest, I'd like to know?

He won't listen to me. Not a

thought for his health. You tell

him, he's your brother. He'll die

at his desk, out of sheer

selfishness.

Raleigh is now dressed in court fashion, and looks very

well; as the glances of several court ladies show. He

catches Bess's eye and they share a smile.

Calley, listening, rolls his eyes.

Elizabeth, at the table with the Archduke by her side,

glances towards Raleigh, and sees him flirting with the

court ladies. Then back to the young Archduke, who has

hardly touched his food.

S

pane of glass. As she looks, she sees Bess staring at

someone - follows her gaze - and is amused to find that the

object of her attention is also Raleigh.

She beckons to Bess.

Bess comes forward.

Bess turns and looks across towards Raleigh, as he flirts

with the court ladies.

Elizabeth turns back to her guest.

The young Archduke, frozen with shyness, sits staring

before him, trembling as he frames a proper reply.

E

The Archduke's eyes open very wide. He glances at

Elizabeth, and sees on her face a conspiratorial smile.

He's grateful to her, and his shy face shows it.

Raleigh is still being entertained by the court ladies.

Bess has now approached Raleigh.

Bess draws him away from the court ladies.

They both look at the Queen. She's watching Raleigh. He

bows.

Bess thinks for a moment.

She gives him her hand. He kisses it.

S

leave. She speaks to the company.

28                                                               28

She looks up at the laundress, who stands red-eyed and

snuffling, with a guard by her side.

As she speaks, Sir Amyas Paulet enters. Mary's voice

becomes seductive.

Paulet smiles at the notion of Mary naked.

Beneath the charm, steel.

She turns to go, but stops before leaving the room: bitter,

haughty, not deigning to look back.

Mary changes mood again, thinking it more politic to keep

the Warden under her spell. She waves Annette and the

laundress away.

30                                                                 30

She urges her horse forward, forcing Raleigh to catch up.

Raleigh hesitates. She understands him.

Now it is Elizabeth who hesitates. He understands her as

well.

Bess is suspicious and starts to leave.

40                                                                 40

A flash of fear in Bess's eyes.

Elizabeth moves away so that Walsingham can talk to her in

confidence. She listens to his murmured words, and anger

shows on her face.

48                                                                48

The Ambassador decides the best form of defence is attack.

Don Guerau sees no point in further pretence. He speaks

with pride and contempt.

A shrug. What can he do?

He kneels. She taps him on the shoulder with one hand.

He rises, but keeps his eyes on the ground.

He raises his eyes, but he still doesn't look at her.

He turns now, and looks her in the face.

This stops her in her tracks. For a moment she can't trust

herself to speak. Then:

The magus sits at a table before an astrological chart,

while Elizabeth and Walsingham look on.

He transfers his attention to a different, astronomical

chart.

He moves back to the astrological chart.

Elizabeth listens, a faraway look in her eyes. She knows

nothing of the planets, but she feels it deep within

herself: her moment of destiny is near.

Walsingham has been idly examining the scientific

instruments. He speaks now as if his question is casual.

Dr Dee smiles as he gently contradicts him.

Walsingham leaves. Elizabeth turns to Dr Dee. Now for a

short private moment the Queen becomes a woman.

He has led up to this deliberately, and now stands smiling

at her utter confusion. The man who looked like a fool has

been playing his own game all along.

Paulet makes a sign. Burton the brewer comes through the

gate: Walsingham's man after all.

He takes the hollow bung out of one pocket and admires it.

Now she knows it's over. She begins to weep.

His defiant energy breaks Elizabeth's morbid mood.

They hold each other's eyes.

But she can't say it.

Elizabeth smiles a small smile.

Two court officials hurry by. Bess lowers her voice.

Her hand touches her waist.

Raleigh stares at her, stunned. More people are passing.

This is no place for R

Another official passes by.

Raleigh finds himself caught in an impossible situation.

His internal struggle shows itself in the twists and jerks

of his body.

Bess stands before her with her head bowed.

Elizabeth falls on her with uncontrolled rage, striking out

at her, beating her about the head, shrieking out the words

that so inflame and wound her. Bess takes the blows in

silence.

Walsingham comes hobbling up.

But Elizabeth is too far gone. She turns on him, eyes

blazing.

W

Bess responds to the Queen's hysteria with dignity.

Her gaze reaches beyond the Queen. Elizabeth turns.

Now in his solitary dance Raleigh turns, and we see he's

holding a new-born BABY BOY. He kisses the baby's little

bald head, and sings his wordless song.

Footsteps outside. The door opens, and a royal servant

enters, followed by other servants and guards.

Elizabeth enters, in formal style. She stands and takes in

the scene - Raleigh holding his baby son - the room beyond -

Bess rises at once and comes through to make her curtsey to

the Queen. Elizabeth seems not to see her.

A regal wave at the servants and guards. They withdraw.

Elizabeth stalks round the room. No reason to suppose her

displeasure has passed.

Now Elizabeth turns to Bess, and their eyes meet. The Queen

puts out her hand and touches Bess lightly on one cheek. A

silent forgiveness.

Now for the first time she looks at the baby.

Elizabeth moves away, unable to bear seeing the baby.

Elizabeth looks at him in silence for a long moment.

She turns to go. But before she reaches the door, she

stops.

Elizabeth takes the baby in her arms. She holds him

carefully. She finds herself more moved than she had

expected. She bends her head over him, and turns her back

on Raleigh.

Raleigh watches and waits. And waits.

ON ELIZABETH: her cheek pressed to the baby's head. Her

eyes closed.
