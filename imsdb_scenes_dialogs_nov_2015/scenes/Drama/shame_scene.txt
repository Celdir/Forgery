BRANDON picks up money from the table and give it to ALEXA.

She counts it and nods to BRANDON.

ALEXA puts the money in her bag.

BRANDON gestures to his room. ALEXA turns and walks away.

BRANDON follows.

A tidy bedroom-

BRANDON lies on the bed watching, waiting. ALEXA starts to

take her top off.

ALEXA continues slowly, tosses it aside, and continues taking

off her bra and panties. Finally putting her earrings on the

bedside table. BRANDON reaches up to pull her onto the bed.

The SOUND of BRANDON getting up-

The SOUND of blinds being raised-

CLOSE UP of a discarded earring on the carpet.

BRANDON padding naked along a corridor.

The SHARP TONE of the answer machine flicked on in passing-

Audible from the corridor-

We hear BRANDON turn on the shower.

BRANDON walks towards the kitchen and we hear him pour a

glass of water.

BRANDON crosses the hall and enters the toilet.

BRANDON turns on the light, puts down his glass and urinates.

BRANDON finishes, flushes toilet, steps off screen

DEAD TONE

The CALLER hangs up

BRANDON re-appears and closes the bathroom door

BRANDON in the shower, a sense of movement, his hand, barely

visible, moving back and forth.

The fall of the shower-

BRANDON stands, letting the water wash over him.

BRANDON sits, looking over at the PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL sitting

opposite-

The train moves on, after a while stopping at another

platform.

PEOPLE get on, PEOPLE get off.

BRANDON's eyes travel down over the PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL's legs

and up-

She opens them a little, the dip of her skirt, sinking deep

between her thighs-

She looks up, senses BRANDON watching. She lets her fingers

fall in her lap.

BRANDON shifts a little in his seat to get a better look

through the crowd. Suddenly she stands and makes her way to

the train door. Hand reaching out and clenching a metal pole

for stability, revealing a wedding ring.

BRANDON's hand reaches for the pole too, touching her as he

stands behind her. There is a gentle unison contact.

BRANDON's breath, heavy on her neck. Both are frozen to the

spot, caught in a mutual moment.

The train door bolts open and the PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL

disembarks. BRANDON is blocked by a MALE PASSENGER as he gets

out in quick pursuit of the PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL.

BRANDON is several paces behind now, pursues. She turns left

into a stairwell.

It's almost like fighting a downward river. People are

walking into his path as he struggles to keep pace with the

PRETTY SUBWAY GIRL.

The tail of her coat vanishes at the top of the stairs. A

moment later, BRANDON reaches the summit, to be greeted by a

wrought-iron gate.

He looks left at one staircase. People ascend.

He looks right at another staircase. Other passengers ascend.

People come in and out of the turnstiles on the right-hand

side. He has lost her. A sudden moment of disappointment

crosses his face.

He descends the staircase, dejected.

BRANDON walks into his office and to his desk, stops in his

tracks, heart thumping-

A bare space where BRANDON's computer once was and next to it

a replacement computer. A pink fluffy gonk or the like stuck

to the screen.

BRANDON walks into a toilet cubicle, shuts and locks the

door. He cleans the seat with toilet paper, flushes, stands,

and starts to masturbate.

A TAP on the door-

BRANDON enters DAVID's office, DAVID is lost in paperwork,

looking up from his desk.

BRANDON nods, swigs a Red Bull in his hands-

BRANDON exits.

BRANDON is walking with shopping bags. He slows by the

revolving doors, spots a mother with buggy about to come out

of the other door and hurries over to open the door for her.

WOMAN comes out nodding her thanks.

BRANDON looks through his vast record collection and

carefully puts a disk on the record player.

The chink of beer bottles, banging up against one another as

BRANDON opens the fridge door-

BRANDON peers in, considering the left over take out resting

on the shelf. He takes it out, flipping open a bottle of beer

in a familiar move and banging the door shut with his back.

A flyer for an fancy take out flaps under a magnet on the

fridge door.

A comfortable apartment-

BRANDON spoons Chinese take out into his mouth, sliding down

in front a laptop resting on his desk.

Music continues to surround the apartment.

The bright serenade of his laptop opening, BRANDON resumes,

fingers absently tapping the keyboard-

A distant whir of a car alarm, far off.

BRANDON, in the dark, watching pornography on his laptop-

BRANDON's cell phone rings. He ignores it.

And then steady monotonous ring of a telephone close by,

BRANDON barely wavers as it clicks onto answer machine-

The HEAVY DEAD TONE of the answer machine as the caller's

message kicks in-

BRANDON smiles-

BRANDON switches off the answer machine. Sighs, and returns

to his laptop.

A beautiful day-

BRANDON's face now fresh, passing-

A CUTE NEIGHBOR heading into the building, lost in

conversation on her cellphone-

BRANDON juggling cellphone, keys and satchel, heading off to

work, watching the sway of her ass.

MARIANNE is on the phone in a busy office

Profile of MARIANNE's bare back.

BRANDON, seemingly in a trance, looking out across the

office, eyes fixed on MARIANNE in her glass cubicle, unaware

of BRANDON staring.

STEVEN's reflection in the window, we see him screw up a

piece of paper and throw it at BRANDON.

BRANDON shakes his head.

BRANDON once again looks up toward MARIANNE.

MARIANNE on the phone.

DAVID now appears in front of BRANDON. From afar, nods to

him, and greets a group of CLIENTS.

Just visible, in the conference room-

BRANDON inside with the CLIENTS and DAVID. A sense of

camaraderie. The meeting at an end. DAVID, slapping BRANDON

on the back, the sense of celebration.

The thump of music-

BRANDON, DAVID and OTHERS wedged in a leather booth, several

shots and beer down, the table littered with beers. Cheers.

Male camaraderie.

ALL chink glasses

ALL Look off-screen at the women.

BRANDON fist bumps with DAVID

BRANDON starts to stand.

DAVID walks up to the bar behind the women.

DAVID takes ELIZABETH's hand.

DAVID tugs her arm playfully

DAVID pulls ELIZABETH onto the dance floor.

BRANDON turns to watch them on the dance floor.

The pulsing thump of music, the latest cutting edge sounds-

DAVID pulls ELIZABETH into dancing, at first playful and

funny.

DAVID is insistent, pulling her closer, drawing her into a

frenzied awkward dance. BRANDON looking on, the SUITED

WOMAN's eyes grazing his, lingering on BRANDON as DAVID

stumbles.

BRANDON watches the duo dancing

RACHEL and LOREN walk off to the dance floor

ELIZABETH and DAVID are amongst the dancers on the floor.

DAVID is performing enthusiastically. ELIZABETH, slow,

glances at BRANDON.

We see BRANDON through the dancers, watching.

DAVID struggling to push his arm through the twisted sleeve

of his jacket, pursuing ELIZABETH and her friends up the

street.

BRANDON comes out of the club, doing up his coat. Looks away

at DAVID haranguing the trio.

DAVID smiles, gently coaxing her in the opposite direction-

BRANDON hails a cab. DAVID continues haranguing ELIZABETH

A cab pulls up.

BRANDON opens the cab door and waits with the taxi. DAVID

walks towards BRANDON.

DAVID concedes throwing his arms up, jacket half on. DAVID

paws BRANDON affectionately, straightens BRANDON's jacket,

gives him a kiss and stumbles into the cab.

The cab pulls away.

A car glides close to the kerb-

BRANDON head down walking-

BRANDON smiles-

BRANDON gets into the car.

The incessant drone of cars, steady overhead-

Vast concrete supports edging the highway-

BRANDON presses ELIZABETH flat again the grit of the wall

Caught in the scissored half light, they move, with glorious

abandon-

The slice of passing headlights casting fractured light

across their writhing state until-

ELIZABETH gasps, her body shuddering, leaning into his as

they climax together, sweat beading skin.

BRANDON walking along the corridor-

He reaches for his keys, suddenly hesitating on-

The thump of music coming from his apartment-

BRANDON tentatively turns his key and pushes the door open-

BRANDON enters. He looks around, nothing-

The turn of vinyl on the record player-

I Feel Love by Donna Summer steadily rotating-

BRANDON makes his way back to the corridor and notices a

light on in the bathroom from the slit under the door.

He opens up an adjacent cupboard and fishes out a baseball

bat, and heads toward the bathroom.

BRANDON steadily approaches the bathroom door, considers-

He shoves it open, hard, baseball bat at the ready-

BRANDON running, shrieking like a banshee, blinding waving

the baseball bat, slicing air-

SISSY laughs. BRANDON relaxes. She tousles her hair.

BRANDON shakes his head, at a loss.

SISSY throws the towel and BRANDON

BRANDON throws the towel back at her.

BRANDON turns to leave the room

BRANDON closes the door to the bathroom.

We follow BRANDON as he walks through to the living room to

the record player I Feel Love stuck in eternal groove. He

gently lifts the needle off the record. He uses the baseball

bat to pick up SISSY's scarf. He sniffs it.

Silence-

BRANDON stands considers-

Later -

BRANDON is watching pornography on his laptop, hears SISSY on

the telephone. He listens.

Pause

Pause

BRANDON moves the laptop and starts to get up.

BRANDON is listening at the door.

BRANDON closes his eyes, resigned.

BRANDON sliding whisked eggs into a pan of sizzling butter-

SISSY enters and sits on the kitchen counter, wearing a long-

sleeved white t-shirt and holding the earring left by the

Pretty Woman [prostitute]. Dangling it in front of BRANDON-

BRANDON pushes her down as she gives him a big kiss.

SISSY, happy, walks back to sit down at the table.

SISSY sprinkles salt on her breakfast. She smile, playful,

resumes eating-

The door slams. SISSY sighs and stares towards the front

door, a sadness hanging-

SISSY stands, toes edging over the platform.   BRANDON pulls

her back.

SISSY stares at BRANDON. Instinctively, BRANDON feels her

gaze. He turns and looks. They hold each other's eyes for

more than a beat. BRANDON turns away. SISSY begins picking

pieces of fluff off BRANDON's shoulder. BRANDON, visually

irritated.

SISSY goes again.

A quick moment passes. BRANDON picks the fluff off his

shoulder and puts it on SISSY's shoulder - to her amusement.

BRANDON adjusts the hat.

SISSY gently bumps his shoulder with hers.

SISSY stamps her feet excitedly.

SISSY leans her head on BRANDON's shoulder and he puts his

arm around her.

BRANDON hurries into the office area, unbuckling his coat as

he does so. DAVID, phone pressed to his ear, mid way through

a conference call clocks him, throws some lewd gesture.

BRANDON smiles, throws up his hands, he's late. What can you

do...

BRANDON continues into his office.

BRANDON puts down his coffee, and takes off his scarf.

BRANDON puts his scarf in the closet and takes off his coat.

BRANDON hangs up his coat.

BRANDON laughs as he sits down at his desk.

BRANDON sips his coffee.

BRANDON stands, in the coffee area making himself a generic

filter coffee.

MARIANNE is seated in her glass office in the background at

her desk.

DAVID approaches, slapping BRANDON on the ass.

BRANDON pours coffee, glancing at DAVID behind him.

DAVID looks at him, shakes his head in a knowing fashion.

BRANDON watches DAVID walk into his office, shutting his door

behind him.

He turns right abruptly, pass the coffee area, and then right

again. A COLLEAGUE is coming out of a door. He holds it open

for BRANDON as he walks in. The door slowly closes, exposing

the MEN'S sign for the bathroom.

BRANDON and DAVID, not knowing what is to await them, walk

towards the doors of the beautiful setting of THE BOOM BOOM

ROOM.

BRANDON and DAVID take off their scarves and coats.

BRANDON and DAVID give their coats to FEMALE STAFF MEMBER.

DAVID glances back at BRANDON

DAVID and BRANDON walk on towards the bar.

BRANDON and DAVID enter a beautiful bar. A spectacular 180

degree view of Manhattan. The room has the most elegant

decor. It is to die for:

Metropolis meets Blade Runner, a glittering New York skyline

to the North of the room, the grey endless black of the

Hudson River to the South.

It surpasses DAVID's idea of classy.

The murmur of conversation-

The shake of cocktails mixed-

BRANDON and DAVID follow the HOSTESS to take a seat at a far

table.

A stunning leggy COCKTAIL WAITRESS walks up to the table,

dressed in silky 1930's cigarette girl costume.

BRANDON looks away, eyes filling with tears.

BRANDON puts down his drink, blotting his coaster with the

imprint of the deep red rim of his glass-

He's the only one not applauding.

SISSY is being congratulated by a HIP MEDIA TYPE and his

WIFE. The scene is one of congratulations, SISSY is admired.

SISSY confident approaches DAVID and BRANDON. She is bold and

self-aware.

DAVID finishes his martini.

BRANDON looks unenthusiastic

BRANDON wedged in the back of the cab, with DAVID and SISSY

as they are lost eating one another's faces.

Looking uncomfortable, BRANDON frequently takes glimpses in

the rear view mirror.

DAVID and SISSY continue making out. It's almost animal.

A dimly lit street-

A cab is pulling up. DAVID opens the door.

DAVID is wearing SISSY's hat.

Finally SISSY steps out of the cab, DAVID lifts her over his

shoulder.

SISSY starts to enter thru the revolving door. DAVID follows

BRANDON is left alone to pay the driver.

BRANDON waits in the lobby, pressing the button for the

elevator. An elevator arrives. He ignores it and sits down.

Darkness-

BRANDON enter his apartment door.

He hears giggling from his bedroom.

BRANDON walks to his kitchen.

HE hits the kitchen cabinet in frustration.

He walks into the living area and paces.

BRANDON considers, looking out through the window, he sits on

the ledge, wringing his hands.

MORE GIGGLING, hushed now, more breathless-

BRANDON takes off his shoes and starts to undress. We hear

SISSY and DAVID making love.

BRANDON doesn't want to hear. BRANDON stands back against a

wall, as if transfixed, as if he cannot take any more. His

breathing is irregular. Something of the past has come to the

present. All of his distractions have now stopped, and he is

at once confronted with himself.

His face bears the pain of something long passed, but

visually present. This wound has not healed.

Jolting himself out of his trance, BRANDON hurriedly heads

out into the corridor-

BRANDON pulls running gear from the hallway closet an exits,

leaving the RISING BREATH of DAVID and SISSY LOST IN FURTIVE

SEXUAL INTERCOURSE DRIFTING ALONG THE CORRIDOR, JUST AUDIBLE,

QUIETLY PROVOKING AS IT UNDERSCORES.

A dimly lit street-

BRANDON just visible in his apartment block steady on the

approach. He is dressed in running gear.

Pushing the glass doors open, BRANDON hesitates and presses a

button on the iPod Nano on his arm. He stretches, zips his

top, pulling his hood up.

BRANDON slips his earphones on, moving off.

BRANDON running past illuminated windows and neon lights. The

city is alive. BRANDON stays focused, running, music pumping

in his head.

Later

BRANDON enters his apartment checking for noises.

The sound of movement in the bathroom.

He pushes open his bedroom door. It's like a murder scene.

Pale blue sheets in disarray, the mattress nearly coming off

the bed, sheets soaked with sweat and the smell of sex.

A lone condom disregarded on the floor.

We see his bedside drawer ajar.

He walks into his bedroom and pushes the drawer shut.

Later -

BRANDON lies on his bed, with clean white sheets, sidelight

on.

SISSY enters. BRANDON opens his eyes, inwardly flinches.

SISSY gets into the bed, covering herself with the white

sheet. Snuggles up to BRANDON

SISSY inhales through her teeth.

Uncomfortable SILENCE-

SISSY doesn't move.

All this time, BRANDON has not looked at SISSY, staring up to

the blank ceiling. He SCREAMS at the top of his lungs-

SISSY gets up, deliberate, as if rising from the dead, and

slowly walks around the bed.

SISSY SLAMS the bedroom door on her exit.

Midday-

The office is in full flow-

BRANDON crosses it, clearly worse for wear.

A TECHNICIAN wheels a computer out of BRANDON's office.

BRANDON heads towards his desk, stopping on seeing-

STEVEN exits again.

BRANDON observes, his computer is back at his desk.

BRANDON puts his head around the-

From beyond-

BRANDON exits.

BRANDON takes this opportunity to leave.

DAVID looks up, watches BRANDON heading back to his desk,

quietly considering.

A child's painting stuck to the wall behind DAVID.

BRANDON, lost in familiar routine, pours sugar into his

coffee-

BRANDON looks up, MARIANNE loiters-

MARIANNE is still standing, waiting. They look at each other.

Eventually she turns and walks out.

BRANDON stands at the end of a long pier, looking out toward

the Hudson River, the LAP of murky water, audible. He hovers

for a moment, and considers, then slowly makes his way back

to the main road.

The glittering lights of Jersey stretching wide beyond.

Above, the tall, endless glass of The Standard Hotel, scored

with a honeycomb of windows, randomly illuminated like tiny

still lives.

BRANDON comes to a corner, lights a cigarette and leans.

Above him, engraved in stone is "1949." He looks up toward

the tall building, which appears like a Stasi East Berlin

building. Stark and authoritative.

A KID slaps his palms against the glass of a fourth floor

window, a FILIPINO NANNY ushers him away.

A WOMAN, early 30s, phone to her ear, dressed in black jeans

and t-shirt, paces along the window. Catching sight of

BRANDON, she PULLS the curtain along the length of the glass.

A MAN stares blankly out, clearly fresh in on a flight and

jet lagged, enjoying the view two floors up.

A FEMALE CLEANER just visible lost in the monotony of

cleaning, makes large brush strokes with a large pink fluffy

duster.

And then BRANDON sees her-

A MIDDLE AGED WOMAN stands, naked her body pressed against

the floor to ceiling glass, high up, overlooking the Hudson

River. The steady back and forth of the MIDDLE AGED MAN

behind her gradually reveals both are lost in a stand up

fuck.

BRANDON hesitates, quiet fascination flickering across his

face as for a brief flickering moment BRANDON's eyes lock

with the MIDDLE AGED WOMAN's dead gaze, standing high above-

A CAR HORN LOUD UNREMITTING-

BRANDON turns, his hypnotism broken. It's as if he comes back

to himself.

A distant restaurant illuminating a dimly lit street-

MARIANNE waiting inside the bar, seated, with a drink,

clearly there for some time. Her eyes checking the room, with

quiet concern.

BRANDON stands watching from a distance-

BRANDON makes to cross, hovering on the edge of the gutter

until-

BRANDON enters the restaurant.

BRANDON sits down at the table where MARIANNE is already

seated.

A WAITER enters.

He pours a little into BRANDON's glass.

BRANDON gestures for the WAITER to pour.

WAITER fills BRANDON's glass.

WAITER finishes pouring BRANDON's wine and starts filling

MARIANNE's.

The WAITER slides the bottle down, moving off-

A dirty grey street, brightened by the glow of BRANDON and

MARIANNE seated inside the restaurant.

LATER-

BRANDON and MARIANNE stand heady from the wine and a little

awkward in the freezing cold-

They walk-

SILENCE

They loiter on the edge of something more.

SILENCE

BRANDON hovers, momentarily fragile, the sting of

uncertainty. MARIANNE descends into the depths of the subway,

with a half wave.

The CLICK of the door-

BRANDON enters. The sound of the record player, which had

finished hours ago, rotates empty on the turntable.

Pulling off his jacket-

SILENCE-

BRANDON puts the needle back in it's dock. HE hangs up his

jacket, takes his bag, heads towards the living room. He

spies all SISSY's crap spilling out across the floor-

He sighs.

Heads to the kitchen and gets a can out of the fridge.

The lock of the front door rotates. Someone is entering the

apartment.

Darkness-

SISSY bursts through the door, in a hurry.

After a moment the bathroom door opens, cutting a slit of

light into the darkness.

From the blackness we see BRANDON framed, masturbating in

front of the bathroom sink.

SISSY, shocked, stands with her hand still on the door

handle, transfixed by a naked BRANDON.

As BRANDON instinctively turns, SISSY runs from view.

SISSY slams the door shut.

BRANDON looks at himself in the mirror, full of shame and

bewilderment and deep embarrassment.

Slowly but surely these expressions turn into rage. He hits

the wall in frustration.

BRANDON opens the bathroom door, with towel tied around his

waist, looking for SISSY.

BRANDON leans over SISSY, pushes her down onto the sofa.

BRANDON climbs onto SISSY, straddling her.

BRANDON locks the bathroom door.

He exhales, letting the moment slowly pass until-

BRANDON lowers himself onto the floow, desperately struggling

with his emotions-

He closes his eyes, eyelashes fragile and flickering until-

BRANDON opens them, reaches a hand out, almost mechanically,

turns up the shower, the room now swirling in steam, trying

to drown SISSY's voice out.

BRANDON closes his eyes, tears pricking-

SISSY walking back from kitchen, resigned-

BRANDON's laptop on and open on his desk.

SISSY approaches it, sinking down in front of the illuminated

laptop.

She absently taps the mouse, dragging open a series of held

windows, the shifting lights of the screen cast across her

face, revealing-

Slowly SISSY's face changes, a blurred smorgasbord of porn

sites, graphic and obscene, their colors reflecting across

her face and body. An escalating collage of graphic images,

obscene sexual messages and a provocative sexual conversation

hanging mid sentence addressed to a live sex chatroom. The

images haunting, brutal, from the weird to the

sadomasochistic. The open windows, an endless stacking of

obscene chatroom conversation, emails posted with graphic

sexual photos and live webcam images of every combination of

fucking disappearing into the screen in infinite form.

SISSY is taken aback and strangely intrigued-

Suddenly a voice from the screen, images briefly glimpsed, a

woman legs splayed-

SISSY looks closer, mildly appalled.

BRANDON picks up the laptop and heads towards his bedroom.

SISSY takes her coat and leaves the apartment.

LATER-

The thump of music-

BRANDON sitting on the edge of his bed, the pumping music

from a stereo in the apartment seemingly getting louder,

hands grasping his hair. Then suddenly he enters the whole

contents of his bedside drawer into a black garbage bag.

Then, BRANDON moving like a dervish through the apartment, a

black garbage bag in his hand, dumping pieces of paper, post

it notes and business cards with hastily written cellphone

numbers on the back.

BRANDON moves on, picking up anything he can find. An old

jacket, elbows worn. A handful of old t-shirts.

He moves off down the corridor with growing frenzy, grabbing

more crap along the way, one of SISSY's dirty thongs on the

floor. He picks it up, moving on.

An open fridge-

BRANDON tipping bowls of old food and long past it sell by

date mush into the bag.

Cans of Red Bull, crappy cereals, jam with mould on top, an

old joint, magazines all get dumped on route.

BRANDON heads out, picking up more detritus along the way,

old pens, an old cellphone, a pair of defunked headphones-

A pile of porn mags, in a cupboard, pulled out as he heads

down along the corridor.

BRANDON strips the room, pulling out an old pair of sneakers

smelling and cracked from under a chair. He peers up, looks

around the room almost bare-

His laptop resting on his desk. BRANDON stops, considers,

initially resistant and then something finally compels him to

do it-

He picks up the laptop, yanking the plug hard from the wall.

Dumping it inside the garbage bag, he moves on picking up an

ipod, a gameboy, ipod nano, wires and cables and stuff.

Slapping a tangle of wires into the garbage, he drags the

heaving bag of crap out into the corridor.

The SLAM of the front door-

BRANDON heading down the steps of his apartment, heaving the

swelled and dripping bag into a heaving garbage can parked on

the sidewalk. A pile of black garbage bags already piled up

along the street in waiting for collection.

Further down the street a YOUNG COUPLE holds hands, walks by

the arrangement of trash bags littering the sidewalk.

A SIREN goes past-

The DISTANT banter of a GANG OF KIDS.

BRANDON heads back up to his apartment, shutting the door

firmly.

BRANDON, now the voyeur, looks across the room, into

MARIANNE's office. He studies her, almost like prey. The

moment seems to last a lifetime. There is much want in

BRANDON's face, but from this distance seems unobtainable.

Suddenly, and without any warning, BRANDON walks into his

dream, entering MARIANNE's office, and pulls her behind a

partition, kissing her unapologetically and passionately.

She responds, startled, but happy to be taken. She

surrenders.

They pull away, looking at one another. She smiles,

laughing, his spirit infectious, drawing her on.

BRANDON leads MARIANNE away.

BRANDON and MARIANNE stepping out of a cab, BRANDON leading

MARIANNE, both giggling and tripping.

MARIANNE stops. She smiles, quizzically, allowing herself to

be guided and yet-

BRANDON snorts two lines of coke in quick succession on top

of the white water tank in the toilet.

Exiting, we see MARIANNE looking out onto the Hudson from the

large hotel window.

BRANDON enters the bedroom, stopping to prepare a drink.

Watching MARIANNE at the window.

He pours a drink from the mini bar.

BRANDON approaches nervously, standing next to her.

MARIANNE leans up and kisses BRANDON.

MARIANNE takes BRANDON's hand and leads him to the bed. We

see both of them slowly discovering each other through tender

touches.

MARIANNE caresses BRANDON's face and kisses both his eyes.

BRANDON attempts to do the same to MARIANNE, slowly but

surely. This ritual becomes more aroused, clothes start to

fall away, revealing for the first time both each other's

flesh.

BRANDON rolls up her skirt, laughs at her panites. MARIANNE

giggles.

The ritual begins to get more passionate, as they feel for

each other's breasts and thighs.

At the height of this passionate encounter, BRANDON's

attention strangely, slowly starts to fade. It's as if the

intimacy that he has discovered starts to frighten him.

He recoils, unable to continue.

Both lie on their backs silently, in frustration, breathing

heavily. MARIANNE's face is one of puzzlement and hurt. She

looks at BRANDON for some kind of answer. He gets up.

MARIANNE, unsure what to do, sits up and pulls down her

skirt, adjusts her hair.

Late afternoon sunlight seeping across the room-

BRANDON sits at the edge of the bath looking out onto the

view.

MARIANNE looks at him, the moment fragile. She does up her

bra.

Hurt, MARIANNE put on her top, picks up her bag and makes to

leave

SILENCE-

BRANDON looks back out over the grey of the Hudson River.

BRANDON's face is one of embarrassment and failure.

The CLICK of the door, MARIANNE gone.

The HUM of the traffic, audible through an ajar window.

BRANDON reaches his hand out, catching the breeze, peering

down, a man on the edge.

BRANDON banging the life out of HOTEL LOVER, doggy style,

tits pressed up against the glass of the window-

The DISTANT SCREECH of horns.

The trawl of cars-

The grey of the Hudson River-

BRANDON and the HOTEL LOVER just visible high above, caught

full frontal in the window-

BRANDON close to climax-

A cold sweat beading BRANDON's forehead as he comes, face

twisted before the slow seep of release.

BRANDON withdraws, laughs. The HOTEL LOVER laughs as well.

BRANDON turns, for a moment she is almost beautiful.

HOTEL LOVER smiles, already pulling on her underwear. BRANDON

watches her, pulling on a tiny thong. She looks up, stares at

him.

BRANDON looks away, fighting back the cold flutter of shame.

HOTEL LOVER hesitates, smile, shakes her head.

BRANDON nods. HOTEL LOVER fingers fastening a cheap nylon

bra.

BRANDON sits on the bed, now alone, caught in the half light

of dusk-

The rise and fall of a distant lift.

BRANDON is sitting on the couch, watching a cartoon. SISSY

enters the apartment, on her cell phone. BRANDON ignores her

SISSY hangs up.

SISSY Sits down next to BRANDON on the couch.

BRANDON makes his way to the closet, taking his coat.

BRANDON exits the apartment.

BRANDON's reflection in the window as the train travels.

We see that BRANDON has a nasty cut on his cheek.

Earlier that night-

BRANDON sits, drinks alone at the bar-

An OLDER GUY paws a GAUNT YOUNG WOMAN plying her with drinks,

knocking them back much to his delight.

BRANDON watches, catching the eye of a girl (CARLY) walking

towards the bar, her friends playing pool-

CARLY smiles, as she leans against the bar, her breasts

spilling out of her T-shirt.

CARLY giggles-

CARLY looks over at her MUSCULAR BOYFRIEND just visible

across the bar talking to a couple of GUYS.

CARLY looks at him, sobering and yet-

BRANDON's hand discreetly reaches down, up and under the

girl's skirt, shocking her a little and yet-

CARLY leans in closer, her lips blotting the edge of a glass

overfilled with beer.

BRANDON turns, smiles provocatively, knows what's coming

next.

The MUSCULAR BOYFRIEND reacts as BRANDON shoves his fingers

under his nose.

The MUSCULAR BOYFRIEND shoves BRANDON.

BRANDON laughs, sips his drink-

BRANDON is rounding a corner, doing up his jacket. The

MUSCULAR BOYFRIEND runs out after him.

He spins BRANDON around and punches him.

The slip and slide of BRANDON's shoes, his face smashed

against the sidewalk. The MUSCULAR BOYFRIEND comes in hard

again, kicking him, sharp in the ribs. BRANDON recoils yet

almost seems to want more as he struggles to stand. He spits

on BRANDON.

BRANDON walking, aimless and bleeding-

The DRONE of taxi's streaking past-

TWO WOMEN seated outside a bar, drinking and smoking, lost in

their laughing conversation oblivious-

BRANDON walks on-

A YOUNG MAN with a satchel roughly brushes past him-

The YOUNG MAN wavers on seeing BRANDON is crying, moving on-

BRANDON's face head down wanting to get away.

A rush of TEENAGERS and MIDDLE AGED COUPLES spilling out of a

cinema-

BRANDON walking, disorientated, jaywalking through the

traffic.

The SCREECH of horns-

BRANDON ignores them, he crosses streets, traffic, darting

off the sidewalk into the road, when human, dog or stroller

gets in his way until-

BRANDON walking past a blur of yellow Neon and glow of shop

signs-

Across the street, a snaking queue of MEN wait in line

outside a club.

He keeps walking, eyes scouring-

TEENAGERS loiter, in oversized clothes, sunk under caps and

hoods.

A lively bar; a couple of HOT GIRLS entering-

BRANDON considers, goes to enter, barred by BOUNCERS, who

point him back along the cue-

He stands in line-

Across the street, a THICK SET GUY eyes him. He stands

smoking outside a heaving bar. BRANDON looks away-

A GANG OF GIRLS pass, The BOUNCERS let them in with ease.

BRANDON reaches for his iPhone, tries to cover his face with

his phone to get into the club-

BRANDON ties to get in again. The BOUNCER stops him a second

time.

The THICK SET GUY over the street, flicks out his cigarette,

eyes grazing over BRANDON as he re-enters the heaving bar

opposite.

BRANDON considers, hands sunk deep in his pockets.

Through the glass a heaving bar. BRANDON considers, on the

edge until-

He suddenly crosses the street, narrowly avoiding a taxi

streaking past.

Fluorescent light skimming the thick black darkness like a

beam on a lighthouse-

A heaving dance floor of BUTCH BEARS, SKINNY BOYS, and TWIGS,

arms raised, dancing to the pulse of music.

The THICK SET GUY, walks away, waiting for BRANDON to follow.

BRANDON follows.

Passing through a low hung door, BRANDON moves along a dark

labyrinth of corridors, eyes grazing over-

Dimly lit crevices, MEN caught briefly in light, lost in

fellatio and stand up fucking-

BRANDON keeps walking, drawn towards a dark doorway-

An endless darkness, punctured with groans from dark cubicles-

BRANDON hesitates, foot slipping on the moist floor.

Suddenly a hand reaches out, drawing him into the dark

cubicle-

The THICK SET GUY presses BRANDON up against the wall,

kissing him, tongue searching his mouth, rubbing along its

roof, hungry and urgent.

BRANDON pulls away, hands gently yet forcefully pushing the

THICK SET GUY down on his knees.

BRANDON looks beyond-

A THIN BOY down on his knees sucking a cock through a hole

between walls.

BRANDON stands, legs splayed letting the THICK SET GUY take

him in his mouth. He is beautiful.

The palm of BRANDON's hand pressed against the side of the

cubicle. He stands, fucking the THICK SET GUY in the mouth-

The PULSE of music heaving, the club rocking, punctured by

groans and grunts of rough sex from deep within.

BRANDON throws his head back, gripping the cubicle wall.

The early hours-

BRANDON, heading away. He clocks his phone, several messages

from SISSY logged.

BRANDON listens to his voicemail-

BRANDON pockets his phone.

BRANDON stops and knocks on an apartment door. A woman opens

and BRANDON steps in.

A threesome. BRANDON has sex with a BLONDE and BRUNETTE.

Throughout the images of the threesome, we hear more of

SISSY's Voicemail.

BRANDON, at climax, his animalistic grimace turns to pain and

anguish.
