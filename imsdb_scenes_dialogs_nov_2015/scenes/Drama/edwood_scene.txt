FADE IN:

INT. HAUNTED MANSION PARLOR - NIGHT

We move through a spooky shrouded parlor, as a storm rages

outside.  THUNDER roars, and lightning flashes in the giant

windows.  in the center of the room lies an oak coffin.

Suddenly the lid starts to creak open. A hand crawls past

the edge... and then the lid slams up!  Famed psychic CRISWELL

pops out.  Criswell, 40, peers at us intently, his gleaming

eyes framed under his striking pale blonde hair.  He intones,

with absolute conviction:

EXT. NIGHT SKY

Lightning CRACKS.

We drift down past the dark clouds... through the torrential

rain... and end up...

EXT. HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT

We've landed in Hollywood, 1952.  We're outside a teeny, grungy

playhouse.  The cracked marquee proclaims "'THE CASUAL

COMPANY,' WRITTEN AND DIRECTED BY EDWARD D. WOOD, JR."

Pacing nervously in the rain is ED WOOD, 30, our hero.

Larger-than-life charismatic, confident, Errol Flynn-style

handsome, Ed is a human magnet.  He's a classically flawed

optimist: Sweet and well-intentioned, yet doomed by his demons

within.

The doors open, and Ed's pal JOHN "BUNNY" BRECKINRIDGE, 45,

hurries out.  Bunny is a wealthy, theatrical fop wearing a

string of pearls.

Suddenly the rest of the cast runs up, frantically upset.  In a

flowing white dress is DOLORES FULLER, 23, a sharp, hungry-

for-a-career ingenue.  She's near tears.

They all look to Ed, awaiting a response.  He thinks a second,

then excitedly CLAPS his hands.

She hands Ed her white shoes.  He snatches one, grabs a pair of

scissors, and starts CUTTING up the shoe.  Everyone is baffled.

He keeps cutting the shoe... and it slowly takes on the shape

of a dove!

Ed then grabs some pipe cleaners, works them into a shape, and

sprints into the dressing room.  He takes some green eye shadow

and excitedly smears it on the pipe cleaners.  Ed then hurries

back out, jams the green pipe cleaners into the cut-up shoe...

and it looks like a dove with an olive branch in its mouth!

The cast is flabbergasted.

BACK ONSTAGE

The soldiers suddenly look up.

Dolores floats down onto the stage, holding out the dove.

INT. SCRUFFY COFFEE SHOP - LATER THAT NIGHT

Ed and his gang celebrate opening night in a dirty 24-hour

diner.  They're noisily slugging down drinks, in a big red

booth.

He grins at Actor #1, aka PAUL MARCO, a young eager beaver

who's loyal like a dog.

Actor #2, aka CONRAD BROOKS, a friendly, simple-minded lug,

runs up waving a newspaper.

Ed opens the paper to the entertainment page.

INSERT - THE NEWSPAPER.  Ed turns to a column, "The Theatrical

Life, By Victor Crowley."  Under this is a photograph of an old

man with an ascot.

WIDE

Everybody excitedly crowds around and starts reading.   A

moment... and then their faces drop.  Clearly, this is a

disastrous review.  Their faces get sadder, and sadder... and

then they finish.  A melancholy beat, until --

Ed calmly waves his arms for attention.  He tries to smile.

Everyone kind of stares at their drinks, depressed.  Ed

launches into an upbeat speech.

He smiles at everyone at the table.  They all believe what he

says, and there is a hushed moment of dream-filled hope.

INT. DOLORES' APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT

Ed and Dolores lie in bed, in the dark.  He stares vulnerably

at her.

Dolores kisses Ed affectionately.

She gets out of bed.  We see her tiny apartment is drab and

crumbling.  Dolores turns on the shower, then walks to the

closet.  She looks inside.

ANGLE - ED

He rolls over in bed, away from her.

INT. STUDIO WAREHOUSE - DAY

CU on Ed reading "The Hollywood Reporter."  A RUDE BOSS in

suspenders suddenly strides up.

Ed jumps up.  We WIDEN, revealing he's in a giant greenhouse,

packed with rows of potted plants and shrubs.  Ed grabs a small

palm tree and hurries out.

EXT. MOVIE STUDIO - DAY

Ed strolls across the busy movie lot, lugging the palm.  He

passes a soundstage and notices the stage door open a crack.

Ed glances around, then puts down the palm and hurries in.

INT. SOUNDSTAGE o SAME TIME

A big-budget foreign legion movie is shooting, with a huge cast

and crew. A giant desert set has been erected, with camels and

real sand dunes. Ed is blown away.

A SECURITY GUARD sees him.

Ed is caught.  He hurries out.

EXT. MOVIE STUDIO o DAY

Ed continues across the lot, carrying his palm tree.  An OLD

CRUSTY MAN sticks his head out an office window.

Ed puts down the plant again and runs in.

INT. EDITING ROOMS o DAY

The old guy is proudly showing Ed STOCK FOOTAGE on a moviola.

The footage is totally random: Giant explosions, buffalos

stampeding, tanks, an octopus swimming, etc.

Ed is dazzled.

The old guy cackles.

EXT. MOVIE STUDIO - DAY

Ed finally carries the tree into the Laemmle Building.

INT. STUDIO OFFICES - SAME TIME

Young SECRETARIES in June Cleaver hairdos are giggling.

EEWWW!  All the girls shriek in horror.  Ed walks in and puts

down his plant.

She holds up her "Variety."  Ed hurriedly takes it.

INSERT - VARIETY

The story headline says "BOYoTOoCHICK FLICK TO CLICK."  We PULL

OUT, revealing we're now in

INT. ED'S APARTMENT - DAY

Ed holds the newspaper while he paces around his apartment.

The place has threadbare carpet, faded wallpaper, and an

electric burner for a kitchen.  A handful of mangy DOGS run

around. Tacked-up are movie posters for "DRACULA," "FREAKS,"

and "THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS."

Dolores talks on the phone, while Ed silently coaches her.

Ed gives her a thumbs up -- perfect!  He confidently takes the

phone.

Ed hangs up and YELPS excitedly.  He kisses Dolores.  She pulls

away.

INT. LOW-RENT HALLWAY - DAY

Ed walks jauntily along, wearing a snappy suit.  He reaches a

door that says "SCREEN CLASSICS o George Weiss, President." Ed

fixes his hair, checks his clothes, then enters.

INT. SCREEN CLASSICS o SAME TIME

It's a crowded root, piled with paperwork and files.  Film cans

are stacked everywhere, and framed oneosheets for "TEST TUBE

BABIES," "BLONDE PICKUP" and "GIRL GANG" litter the cracked

walls.  Sitting behind the messy desk is GEORGIE WEISS, 60, a

rug merchant turned exploitation film producer.  He juggles a

large sandwich and angrily barks into the phone.

Georgie slams down the phone.  He smiles warmly at Ed.

Georgie bites into his sandwich.  Ed is dazed.

Georgie pulls out artwork of a hermaphrodite: Man on the left

side, woman on the right.  The lettering screams, "I CHANGED MY

SEX!"

Ed takes a measured piuse.  This is his big revelation.

Georgie sits back.  It's a hell of a story.

Georgie shrugs.

INT. BAR o DAY

Ed sits morosely in a scuzzy bar, three empty shot glasses in

front of him.  A BARTENDER ambles over.

Ed glumly empties his pocket.  All he has is change.  Ed sighs,

and staggers out.

EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - DAY

Ed shuffles down the street, his head hanging low.  A

restaurant door opens, and an EISENHOWER ERA NUCLEAR FAMILY

exits.  Whitebread Dad, Mom, Son, and Daughter stride out in

their starched clean clothes.

They march obliviously past Ed.  He watches them go, then

continues.  Ed reaches a building, "HOLLYWOOD MORTUARY," and

glances in the window.  A pause, then he does a doubletake.

THROUGH THE WINDOW

The showroom is filled with sample coffins.  Lying inside one

is BELA LUGOSI.

ANGLE - ED

He is flabbergasted.

INT. HOLLYWOOD MORTUARY - SAME TIME

Lugosi slowly sits up inside the coffin.  Bela is an aged 70-

year-old man, once a great star, now a faded memory trying to

hang on to his nobility.  Quite frail and tired, he is still a

master of the grand gesture.

An UNCTUOUS SALESMAN steps up.  Bela speaks, in a thick

Hungarian ACCENT which gives him an Old World elegance.

Mildly annoyed, Bela climbs out. He straightens his cloak and

walks to the exit -- where be bumps into nervous Ed.

Bela peers at Ed, then glances confusedly over his shoulder at

the salesman.  Oh.  Bela looks back at anxious Ed.

Bela strides out.

EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - SAME TIME

Bela hurries along.  Ed chases after him.

Bela pulls out a large smelly cigar and lights it.

A CITY BUS approaches.

The bus pulls up, and the doors open.  Ed is worried he's about

to lose his new friend.  He gets an idea...

INT. 1948 NASH RAMBLER - DAY

Ed drives anxiously.  Bela sits next to him, filling the car

with smoke from his big cigar.

Bela puffs on his oversized cigar.

EXT. BELA'S NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

Ed drives past pumping oil wells and into a seedy neighborhood.

They reach a tiny, well-manicured house.  Ed and Bela get out.

Bela's eyes twinkle.  He reaches his front door and unlocks it.

INSIDE... it's awful.  Squalid, dark, with skulls and strange

voodoo objects scattered about.  Up front hangs a large

photograph of shockingly young Bela, handsome and regal.

Ed is stunned by this dismal place, but doesn't say anything.

Within, DOGS start BARKING crazily.

The dogs BARK louder.

Bela smiles and steps inside.  The door closes.

INT. DOLORES'S APARTMRNT - DAY

Dolores is in her 1950's kitchenette, making a green jello

mold.  Ed bursts in, euphoric.

Ed's eyes pop.

Ed calms down.  He smiles beatifically.

INT. STUDIO WAREHOUSE - DAY

Ed is back in the plant department, arguing with his boss.

The guy takes a mocking face and struts out.  Ed glares.

EXT. BELA'S ROUSE - NIGHT

It's Halloween night.  CHILDREN in trick-or-treating costumes

parade up and down the streets.  Through Bela's window, we see

him and Ed watching TELEVISION -- a small fuzzy screen in a

huge console.

INT. BELA'S HOUSE - SAME TIME

ON THE TV, one of Bela's old '30s horror films plays.  Bela's

evil character is hypnotizing somebody: His eyes stare the

famous stare, then his hand does the famous hypnotic gesture.

ON ED AND BELA

They are entranced.  The men drink beers in silence.  Bela's

TWO DOGS lie at his feet.

ON THE TV

The old movie suddenly stops, and VAMPIRA appears on the TV

screen. Vampira, 25, is the sexy "Creature Feature" hostess,

a pale ghoul slipped into a tight black dress.

She leers in front of a corny fog-shrouded set.  There is a

pumpkin, a broomstick, and a sign reading "Happy Halloween."

ON THE MEN

Ed is disgruntled.

Ed LAUGHS.  Bela waves his arm and starts doing his hypnotic

hand gesture at the TV.

Ed joins Bela in this activity.  The two of them wave their

arms spookily at the TV.

Bela becomes fatigued.

Bela smiles.  He gets up, shuffles across the room, and steps

draws the curtain tight.  We hear mysterious CLANGING, drawers

opening and closing, and then silence.

Ed sits, waiting.

Behind the curtain, something DROPS.  We hear a muffled "Shit!"

Ed is getting worried.  But then the curtain whips open, and

Bela bounds out, grinning.  He's a bundle of energy.

AT THE DOOR

The doorbell RINGS.  Kids SHOUT "Trick or treat!"  Bela jumps

up gleefully.

Bela puts on his famous cape, then gets a pair of fangs and

sticks them in his mouth.

OUTSIDE

Little kids in Lone Ranger and Howdy Doody costumes giggle

expectantly.

Suddenly the door flies open, and standing there is Count

Dracula!  The

and run.

Bela chuckles.  Every kid is gone... except one TOUGH BOY.

Suddenly Ed lurches out, menacingly.

Ed RIPS HIS TEETH out of his head and thrusts them at the

kid.  The boy SCREAMS in terror and races away.

Bela is wowed.

Ed smiles impishly, then sticks the teeth back in his mouth.

EXT. STREET - LATER THAT NIGHT

Ed and Bela run toward us, Bela's cape flapping in the wind.

Ed takes a swig from Bela's flask.  They're a bit tipsy.

EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

The moonlight shines down on a rickety old cemetery.  The wind

blows hauntingly, and tombstones gleam in the blackness.

Ed and Bela reach the locked gates.  They glance at each other,

then start to climb over.  Ed helps Bela.  They jump down, and

Ed peers nervously.

Bela looks like a child on Christmas morning.  He takes another

swig, then starts running giddily.

He disappears into the cemetery.

Bela darts happily through the graves.

His cape flies behind him.

Ed's eyes light up.  He starts chasing after Bela.

Bela's heart is racing.  He zig-zags past ancient crypts.

Gargoyles peer down.  The wind howls through the skeletal

trees, silhouetted against the cloudy sky.

Ed runs through the shadows, trying to catch up.

Bela flaps his cape up and down.  We almost think he's going to

fly.

Ed races up, then quietly stops.  He eagerly watches Bela,

practically expecting him to turn into a bat.  It's a magical,

crazed moment.

Bela laughs, then lies down on the grass.

WIDE

Ed slowly walks over and lies next to Bela.  They're happy,

eyes alert, on top of the world.

Ed peers in wonder at his new friend.

INT. SCREEN CLASSICS OFFICE - DAY

Ed sits across from Georgie.  Ed's very excited.

Ed gulps excitedly.  He has a spiel all planned out.

Georgie shakes his head.

Ed grins.

Ed opens his valise and whips out an 8x10 GLOSSY OF BELA.

Georgie mulls this over.  He's interested.

Georgie stares carefully at Ed, then finally smiles.

ANGLE - ED

He leaps up euphorically.  He eagerly pumps Georgie's hand.

INT. ED'S APARTMENT - DAY

CU on a ROYAL TYPEWRITER.  Ed's hands whirl across the portable

typewriter, frantically feeding in pages as fast as be can

type.  We PULL OUT.

Ed sits on the bed, typing.  He's a blur of activity, juggling

a cigarette, coffee, and a telephone, while he writes.

His adrenalin is pumping.  Ed pours some booze into his coffee.

There's a KNOCK at the door.  Ed carries the phone on a long

cord and answers it.  Bela hurries in, smiling broadly.

Ed hangs up and resumes typing.  Bela is puzzled.

Ed stops typing.  He pours Bela a drink.

Ed quickly starts typing again.

INT. ED'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Ed and Dolores sit at a card table, finishing up dinner.  The

dogs eat scraps below them.

Ed anxiously pulls out a pile of pages.  Dolores looks in awe

at the cover: "'GLEN OR GLENDA' By Edward D. Wood, Jr""

There's an uneasy moment between them.  She senses something

funny.  Dolores takes the script and goes into the bedroom.

The door closes.  Ed starts pacing...

INT. BEDROOM - LATER

Dolores reads the script.  She finishes the last page, then

looks up.  She is very shaken.

Dolores stands.  She grabs the door and opens it.

THROUGH THE DOORWAY

Ed stands somberly

pink angora sweater.

Dolores is totally rattled.  She struggles for a response.

Ed silently nods.

Ed is terribly hurt.  Dolores shakes tht script.

He calmly points at the script.

Ed smiles serenely.

Dolores sighs.

INT. SCREEN CLASSICS - DAY

The hallway is filled with eager TRANSVESTITES.  It's a very

festive atmosphere, and Bunny tries to create some order.

Inside the busy office, Paul types, and Conrad cranks a

mimeograph machine.

In a corner, Georgie angrily waves the script at Ed.

Georgie throws up his hands

EXT. STREET - EARLY MORNING

We are on location for Ed's first film!  A SMALL CREW of a

dozen unpacks the camera and reflectors from their cars.  Ed's

voice rises above the hubbub.

The crew members put down their things and gather in a circle.

In the middle, we reveal Ed, in complete drag.  Dress, nylons,

pumps, lovely blonde wig... he's quite a sight.  Like an eager

Scoutmaster, he addresses his troops.

A COUPLE GRIPS glance at each other.

Veteran CAMERAMAN BILL, an old guy with thick glasses, speaks.

He points up.  Everybody looks at the sky.  The clouds are

gray.

Ed nods in agreement.

THE CREW

disperses.  Ed quickly runs in his heels over to the burly

make-up man, HARRY.

Harry humorlessly powders Ed's nose.  Ed turns away and

suddenly SHOUTS into a giant megaphone.

WIDE

Ed chucks the megaphone and runs crazily past the camera and

behind a building.

A pause, and then Ed,

dignified, steps out and walks down the sidewalk.

Ed stops at a store window.  He's totally in shadow.

A grip grimaces.  He TURNS ON a light

Ed lights up.  He looks in the window, admires a dress on

display, then silently walks out of frame.

A beat.  Ed SCREAMS.

Suddenly a police car turns the corner.

Everyone grabs equipment and takes off.

INT. LARCHMONT STUDIOS - DAY

The company is now shooting inside a dinky soundstage.  There

are dirty mattresses tacked on the walls.  They prep Bela's

set: A fishnet-draped armchair in front of a flat.  Ed is

perched high in his director's chair, back in men's clothes.

Georgie hurriedly strides over.  He holds the script.

Georgie nods.  Oh, okay.

Ed jumps excitedly.

AT THE STAGE DOOR

The door swings open, and Bela strides in, looking dapper.  He

glances at the teensy stage, and his face falls imperceptibly.

Ed runs up, bounding with enthusiasm.

Ed and Bela step over to a corner.

ACROSS THE ROOM

From a distance, Ed pulls a wad of money from his pocket and

peels off a few bills for Bela.  The crew watches, fascinated.

LATER

Bela is seated in the ratty armchair on the set.  Harry does

his make-up.  Harry glances at Bela's arm, and it is full of

TRACK MARKS.  Harry grimaces, but doesn't say anything.

Conrad eagerly scurries up.

Conrad hands him a scrap of paper.  Bela signs it.

Bela's face suddenly hardens.  He snaps.

Bela insanely RIPS up the autograph.

WIDE

Ed panickedly runs up.

Ed is frozen in fear.  He glances across the stage.

Georgie is flabbergasted.  He points urgently at his watch.

Ed nods.  He motions to Conrad: Get out of here.  Conrad runs

away.  Ed leans in to Bela.

Bela waves his outstretched arm.  Ed tries to calm him.

The crew is baffled.  Ed shrugs at them.

The Assistant CLAPS the slate in front of Bela, then runs.

It's dead quiet.  Nobody knows what's about to happen.

WE MOVE IN TO BELA.  And... he suddenly assumes character.

Like the consumate pro he is.  Bela gets a wicked, sinister

leer, then starts intoning threateningly:

CLOSEUP - ED

He is blown away.  He quietly mumbles in amazement.

INT. STAGE - NEXT DAY

Dolores studies her script, as the crew lights a flimsy kitchen

set.  Ed strolls past, nonchalantly removing a ladies' wig and

earrings.  She stares in disbelief.

Dolores quiets down.  She feels bad.

FILMING IN PROGRESS - LATER

A scene is being shot, on camera.  Ed (as Glen) and Dolores (as

Barbara) stare into each other's eyes.  He's dressed normal,

and she wears a fuzzy angora sweater.

She stands up, dramatically takes off her angora sweater, and

gives it to Ed.

He holds it meaningfully, then smiles proudly.

Ed and Dolores hug.

INT. EDITING ROOM - DAY

On a MOVIOLA, we see the black-and-white image of Dolores

taking off her angora and giving it to Ed.

WE PULL OUT.  Ed and Georgie are hunched over, watching the

movie.  Ed smiles proudly.

Georgie peers at his watch.  He shakes his bead.

Ed is quite upset.

Ed is beaten.

INT. SCREENING ROOM - NIGHT

It's the cast and crew screening!  The eager two-dozen people

are packed into a tiny screening room.

The lights dim, and the movie starts.  A LIBRARY MUSIC fanfare,

and then: "Bela Lugosi in GLEN OR GLENDA"

Everyone APPLAUDS excitedly.  Bela smiles.

Credits continue: "Featuring Daniel Davis and Dolores Fuller"

The audience is audibly baffled.  Bunny BLURTS out.

Dolores leans in to Ed.

LATER IN THE MOVIE

ON-SCREEN, Dolores looks tenderly at Ed.

Ed as Glen nervously ponders his response.

But suddenly -- MUSIC THUNDERS in.  The movie cuts to

IN THE AUDIENCE

People are impressed by this technique.  Bela nods in approval.

ON-SCREEN

Out of nowhere, CHEAP JAZZ MUSIC starts, and the movie abruptly

cuts to SLEAZY STAG PARTY-STYLE FOOTAGE!  A bare-chested man

whips a bound woman!  A woman dominates another tied to a large

stick!  A brunette violently rips off her dress and does a

hoochie-coochie dance!

IN THE AUDIENCE

The crowd is stunned.

Ed looks back at Georgie, who's wearing a big satisfied grin.

Ed rolls his eyes.  He turns back to the movie.

INT. PARTY - LATER THAT NIGHT

Everybody is CELEBRATING, with a raucous party.  People are

boozing it up.  BIG BAND MUSIC plays.  Ed dances with Dolores.

Paul smokes a joint.  Conrad falls over a table and breaks a

lamp.  Bela dances happily with a cute young REDHEAD.

Ed's giddy buddies stumble over with foaming glasses of beer.

It's a warm moment.  They all CLINK their glasses.

Dolores kisses Ed.

EXT. BUNGALOW HOUSE - DAY

We're outside a cute little Spanish bungalow house.  Ed and

Dolores are moving in.  They lug furniture from a rented truck.

She just stares.  Ed shrugs, semi-reassuringly.

INT. BUNGALOW - DAY

The house is moved in.  Ed's unkempt dogs run about.  Pumped-up

Ed sits on the bed typing fiendishly fast while wearing an

angora sweater.  A cigarette dangles from his mouth, and a

bottle of booze lays in his lap.  Bela sits quietly nearby.

Ed considers this.

Ed crabs a pen and excitedly scrawls out the word "DRACULA."

Bela frowns.

Ed's mind is working.  He holds out the paper and stares at

it.  Suddenly, he grins.  He grabs the pen and makes a period

after the "DR."  It now says "DR.ACULA"

Ed rips the paper from his typewriter, puts in a blank page,

and starts typing.

EXT. MOVIE STUDIO GATE - DAY

We're outside the imposing gates of MGM.  The lion logo is

overhead.  Ed drives up in his dirty Nash Rambler convertible.

He wears his nicest suit.  Ed peers nervously at the GUARD.

The Guard stares suspiciously at Ed.  His filthy car is leaking

oil.

The man frowns.  He looks through his files -- then finds a

parking slip with Ed's name.  He is surprised.

Ed smiles.

INT. EXECUTIVE WAITING ROOM - DAY

The room is very posh, with fancy paneling and marble floors.

Ed sits nervously under posters for "GRAND HOTEL" and "QUO

VADIS."  Film cans labled "Glen Or Glenda" rest in his lap.

She hits an electric button.  A large oak door swings open.

INT. OFFICE

Behind a giant desk is MR. FELDMAN, a glib, thin over-

caffeinated man.  He jumps up, smiling.

Ed shrugs.  Feldman grins.

Ed leans in.

Ed writes it out, "DR. ACULA," then waves it in Feldman's face.

Feldman nods.

Ed grimaces.  Lugosi was 90% of his pitch.  He vamps.

Ed is elated.

INT. STUDIO SCREENING ROOM - DAY

Feldman and his fellow SMARMY EXECUTIVES sit in a plush

screening room.  They are viewing "Glen Or Glenda."

ON-SCREEN, Ed is in drag.  A SOLEMN NARRATOR within the movie

speaks:

ANGLE ON THE EXECUTIVES

They are stupefied.  Yikes!

Feldman squints at the screen.

Everybody suddenly starts HOWLING with laughter.

EXT. NEWSSTAND - DAY

Ed zooms up and chipperly jumps from his car.  He buys a "Los

Angeles Herald-Express," eagerly opens it to the entertainment

pages... and then gets a confused look.  Ed quickly starts

rifling through the pages -- something is wrong.

EXT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY

Ed angrily shouts into the phone.

An OLD-FASHIONED SPLIT SCREEN of Georgie on the phone appears.

Georgie SLAMS down the phone.  His split screen WIPES off,

leaving Ed standing alone.

Ed stares at the phone, then quietly hangs it up.

INT. OLYMPIC AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

WHAM!  A WRESTLER throws another WRESTLER at the mat.  The

crowd CHEERS raucously.  We're at the Saturday Night Wrestling

Matches!

In the stands are Ed, Dolores, Bunny, and Bunny's new YOUNG

MALE "FRIEND."  Seated around them are hollering truckers and

ex-Marines.  Bunny giggles and nudges gloomy Ed.

Ed is astonished.

The truckers nearby stare.  Dolores covers her face.

The crowd suddenly ROARS and jumps up.  A favorite wrestler has

entered the ring, massive TOR JOHNSON, 50.  Tor is an

incredible sight: A bald, lumbering behemoth.

The crowd goes apeshit.  The stands are going to collapse from

the SHOUTING.

Ed's eyes are the size of saucers.

The bell RINGS.  Tor quickly grabs his OPPONENT, a man in a

blue mask, and throws him at the ground.  Then Tor jumps onto

his stomach, easily picks him up, and heaves him at the ropes.

People CHEER.  Ed is flabbergasted.

ON TOR

He screams maniacally in Swedish.  Tor lifts the Opponent over

his head and tosses him into the stands.  Three rows of chairs

get knocked over.

EXT. WRESTLER'S BAR - NIGHT

A tiny miniature European car pulls up.  Tor Johnson is

squeezed inside -- ludicrously oversized for this vehicle.  Tor

carefully wedges himself out and enters the bar.

INT. WRESTLER'S BAR - SAME TIME

This rowdy bar is packed with burly WRESTLERS.  Tor walks in,

and men cheerily yell out: "Hey, Tor!" "Hi, Tor!"  Tor grins.

In person, he actually seems a jolly, outgoing fellow.

Ed waves from the corner

Tor smiles and lumbers over

They shake hands.  Ed's hands look like a baby's in Tor's giant

mitts.

Tor tries to sit in the booth.  But he can't fit.

Ed jumps up.  They move to a large table.  Now Tor is happy.

He starts shoveling beer nuts into his mouth.

A WAITRESS saunters over.

She walks off.  Tor shakes the now-empty nut bowl.

Ed tries to grab Tor's attention.

INT. ED'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

Ed and Dolores are asleep.  Suddenly the phone RINGS.  Ed

fumbles for it and groggily answers.

We hear Bela's weak VOICE.

CLICK.  The phone hangs up.  Ed is very alarmed.

EXT. BELA'S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT

The wind is blowing.  Ed's Nash roars up, and he jumps out, a

coat over his pajamas.  He runs up and POUNDS on Bela's door.

Ed tries the door. It's unlocked.

INT. BELA'S HOUSE - SAME TIME

Ed steps into the dark room, and is stunned by what he sees:

Bela is slumped on the floor, pasty white, eyes glazed.  A

rubber tube is tied on his arm, and a HYPODERMIC NEEDLE lies

next to him.

The dogs crouch behind him, whimpering, despondent,

Bela looks up through half-opened eyes.

Aghast, Ed runs over.

Ed nods.  He picks up the old man and carries him across the

room to the couch.  The large portrait of Bela, young and

robust, peers down.

Ed puts a pillow under Bela's head.

Ed sits next to him.  An awkward pause.

EXT. MOVIE STUDIO GATE - MORNING

Ed stands outside MGM, talking into a phone at the guard gate.

INT. ED'S HOUSE - DAY

Dolores tries to cheer up gloomy Ed.  He's wearing angora.

Ed sighs.

Ed looks up.

INT. BANK - DAY

Ed sits opposite a LOAN OFFICER.

INT. DENTIST'S OFFICE - DAY

Ed continues, pitching to three DENTISTS in white coats.

EXT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY

Ed stands at a busy intersection.  He YELLS into a phone.

INT. TV STUDIO - NIGHT

We're backstage at a '5Os variety show.  It's exciting live TV:

Showgirls, techies, and cast members dart about in a state of

hyped-up tumult.

INT. DRESSING ROOM - SAME TIME

Bela and Ed sit in his dressing room, running lines.  Bela is

in his Count outfit: Cape, jet black hair, red lips, etc.  They

both read off SCRIPTS.

Ed interrupts.

An ASSISTANT knocks and sticks her head in.

INT. BACKSTAGE - MINUTES LATER

Ed and Bela stand in the wings.  Onstage is the SHOW HOST, a

cheesy comedian.  He is doing a routine with Criswell, the

famed psychic who opened this movie.  Criswell wears a tux and

a turban and is acting mysterious.

Audience LAUGHS.  Criswell rubs his temples enigmatically.

Ed is mesmerized.

INT. STUDIO - LATER

We're out in the audience.  The curtain rises on a SPOOKY SET:

Shadows, cobwebs, and a coffin in the center.  The Host walks

onstage, to huge APPLAUSE.  He's playing his "Slick" character,

a befuddled moron in a funny hat.  The Host shines a flashlight

around, and then the coffin opens.  Bela sits up.  There's more

APPLAUSE.

The audience LAUGHS.  Then APPLAUSE.

The audience HOWLS with laughter.  Bela is totally lost.  He

seems incredibly confused.

BACKSTAGE

Ed covers his face in embarrassment.

INT. STUDIO HALLWAY - LATER

The Host angrily storms past.

He exits.  A door opens, and Ed and Bela quietly step out.

They shuffle away... until Criswell and his snazzy ENTOURAGE

burst around a corner.  Even in person, Criswell is ethereal

and quite self-important.  He is delighted to see Bela.

Criswell winks.

INT. MOCAMBO ROOM - NIGHT

Latin horns blast onstage of this hopping '5Os nightclub.

Cigarette girls roam about.  Seated at a front table is Ed,

Bela, and Criswell's group.  Everyone's plastered and laughing.

Criswell shouts above the din at a WAITER.

The whole table CRACKS UP.  Bela cheers up.  Ed turns to

Criswell.

Ed's jaw drops.

Criswell smiles knowingly.  Ed nods at this profound wisdom.

EXT. BROWN DERBY - NIGHT

We're outside the legendary hat-shaped restaurant.  A large

Eldorado pulls up, and a CONSERVATIVE MAN and his PLUMP WIFE

step out and approach the DOORMAN.

The couple raise their eyebrows.  They're impressed.

INT. BROWN DERBY - NIGHT

A large banner says "BRIDE OF THE ATOM - NEXT YEAR'S SMASH

HIT!"

In a private back room, Ed is throwing a LAVISH BACKERS PARTY.

All his riff-raff friends are dressed in tuxedos and gowns,

strutting about with flutes of champagne like they're extras

in "The Great Gatsby."

Bewildered POTENTIAL BACKERS wander around.  Ed shmoozes them.

ACROSS THE ROOM

Conrad and Paul sit in a corner.  Conrad has a shoe off and is

scratching his foot.  Ed alarmedly runs over.

ACROSS THE PARTY

Two AMAZED BACKERS have their hands around Tor's giant arm.

ACROSS THE ROOM

An excited HICK BACKER shakes Bela's hand.

ACROSS THE PARTY

Criswell struts in the b.g., talking to someone.

In the f.g., Ed introduces Dolores to a SOUTHERN BACKER.

EXT. BROWN DERBY - LATER THAT NIGHT

Ed and his buddies wave goodbye to the departing backers.

IN THE PARKING LOT

A VALET hands the car keys to the Conservative Backer.

The man glances at his Wife. She shrugs.

The man grimaces.  He checks his pockets, pulls out a handful

of PENNIES, and counts them out...

EXT. ED AND DOLORES'S BACKYARD - DAY

Ed sits in a chaise lounge by the pool, studying papers and

drinking shots of whiskey.  He's in a woman's pantsuit and

fuzzy slippers.  Dolores marches out.

Suddenly Paul hesitantly steps through the back gate.

ANGLE - ED

He slowly smiles. It's like sun breaking through rain clouds.

EXT. RESTAURANT PATIO - DAY

We're at a fancy outdoor brunch.  Ed is shaking hands with

pretty LORETTA KING, 25, a pale brunette in a classy dress.

A WAITER walks over, with a water pitcher.

The waiter is bewildered.  He hurries away.  Ed leans in.

Ed perks up.  She's a live one!

Ed pulls a script from his briefcase and hands it to her.

Ed blanches.

CU - ED

He is aghast.  What a stomach-churning decision.  He stares at

Loretta, then slowly croaks a response.

EXT. ED AND DOLORES'S HOUSE - DAY

We HEAR dishes being violently thrown.  Dolores SCREAMS inside.

INT. HOUSE - SAME TIME

Dolores is crying and screaming angrily.  Ed ducks the objects

she hurls at him.

Dolores is stunned.

She hurls a pot at Ed.  WHACK!  It slams him in the head.

INT. SOUNDSTAGE - DAY

The sets are being erected for "Bride Of The Atom"!  The crew

hurries about the small stage, as Ed energetically supervises.

He has a large band-aid on his head.

Tor lumbers over, in his ripped Lobo outfit.  His face has fake

gashed-up scars.  Tor holds the script.

Ed thinks.  He quickly puts a spin on this.

Loretta walks over, holding two dresses.

Cameraman Bill is standing at the camera.  He squints.

LATER

The crew is shooting on a spooky castle foyer set.

Bela enters, wearing a lab coat costume.  As he slowly crosses,

the old man rubs his hands fiendishly.  Ed YELLS live direction

through a megaphone.

Ed claps his hands triumphantly.

Behind the window, Conrad pours a watering can.

Tor enters, but can barely squeeze his bulk through the door.

Finally he enters.  Ed YELLS through the segaphone.

OFF STAGE

Bela talks to Tor.

BACK ON SET

Cameraman Bill leans in to Ed.

LABORATORY SET - LATER

They are back on the completed lab set.  Beyond the bunsen

burners and beakers is a kitchenette in the corner.

Bela is asleep on a couch.  Ed nudges him.

Bela nods.  He stands up, then grimaces in pain.  So he pulls

two BRIGHT LITTLE PILLS from his pocket and swallows them.

Ed walks Bela onto the lab set.

Ed turns to Tor and Loretta.  She wears a wedding gown.

SHOOTING - LATER

The scene begins.

Bela does his patented hypnotic arm wave.  He actually has a

powerful intensity.  Loretta staggers in, eyes glazed.  Like a

zombie, she climbs onto the operating table.

Tor starts to tie Loretta down, then gets distracted by a piece

of angora hooked to his waist.  He rubs it lovingly, calmed,

then suddenly refuses.

Bela is furious.

Bela pulls out an oversized BULLWHIP and starts WHIPPING Tor.

Tor screams in agony.

Bela chases Tor around the set, WHIPPING him.

ON TOR

He dances about happily.

Tor jubilantly hugs Loretta.  She grimaces.

ON ED

A SURLY STAGE MANAGER strides over to Ed.

Ed nods grimly.  He grabs Loretta and takes her aside.

There's a pause.  They stare at each other.

CLOSEUP - ED

He looks like he s going to throw up.

EXT. SOUNDSTAGE - DAY

The large stage door SLAMS shut.

Ed's disoriented cast and crew stand in the street.  Bela, Tor,

and Loretta are still in costume.

Ed looks totally dazed.  He blinks in the bright sunlight.

INT. BROWN DERBY - NIGHT

We're back at the Brown Derby, for another backers party.  The

same banner is hanging: "BRIDE OF THE ATOM -- NEXT YEAR'S SMASH

HIT!"

The whole crowd is there, dressed up.  Bela sits in the corner,

knocking back a drink.

Paul whispers to Bunny.

ON ED

Ed stands with a circle of POTENTIAL BACKERS.  He has an edge

of desperation we've never seen before.

The guy points.  Ed turns and looks and Vampira is standing

Ed dashes from the room.

NEXT ROOM OVER

Vampira is drinking with a bunch of artsy-fartsy types.  She's

in street clothes, but clearly recognizable.  Ed runs up.

Vampira stares, totally uncomprehending.

Vampire glances at her friends.  They uncomfortably turn away.

BACK AT THE PARTY

The backers glance into the next room.  Ed is in front of

Vampira, begging on his hands and knees.

The backers pick up their coats.  Through the doorway, Ed sees

this.  He jumps up and frantically runs back in.

The backers run out of the room. They're gone.

Ed shouts after them.

No response.

EXT. ED AND DOLORES' HOUSE - DAY

Ed and Dolores are being evicted.  Their belongings are

scattered in front.  They bitterly carry furniture out of the

house.  Ed stumbles and slurs his speech.  He is

Ed drops the furniture.  He flops onto the sidewalk.

Dolores shakes her head.

EXT. TOWERING TEMPLE - NIGHT

Ed and Bela stroll through a parking lot.  Ed is sobered up and

remorseful.  Bela wears a beret and smokes a huge cigar.

They reach the strange entrance to an avant-garde, Eastern

based quasi-religious temple.  Bela puts out his cigar, and

they enter the oversized doors.

INT. TEMPLE - SAME TIME

Sphinxes and Bodhisatvas peer down from the marble walls.  A

service is in progress.  A wiry, enigmatic LECTURER speaks.

Bela leads Ed to a seat, stepping past men in fezzes and odd

elderly women in fur coats.  As the lecture continues, Ed

WHISPERS in bafflement.

Ed leans in to Bela.

LATER

The lecture is over.  The speaker shakes hands with people.

Bela leads Ed along.

They reach the exit.  Ed stops in the huge doorway.

Bela smiles sweetly.

INT. MCCOY MEATPACKING PLANT - DAY

We're in a noisy meat-packing plant.  WORKERS in blood-stained

aprons slam cleavers into hunks of beef.

Ed walks down an aisle with DONALD E. McCOY, a wealthy Texan

meat man.  Old Man McCoy is a tough-talking, tobacco-chewing,

straight shooter.

McCoy grabs a CLEAVER from a worker and slams it into a chop.

McCoy SPITS his tobacco.

Under Ed's cheery frozen smile, his face clearly falls.

INT. SALT LAKE CITY AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

We're at a ROWDY wrestling match.  Tor Johnson is in the middle

of a screaming, four-man tag-team event.  Tor THROWS his

opponent to the ground; then tags with his partner and goes to

the corner.

Suddenly a WRESTLING COACH runs up, dragging a telephone on a

very long cord.

He hands sweaty Tor the phone.  Tor speaks into it.

CLICK.  Ed hangs up.  Tor is flabbergasted.

INT. SOUNDSTAGE - EARLY MORNING

"Bride Of The Atom" is back in production!  Ed's stock company

is reunited.  People drink coffee and gossip.

The stage door opens and standing there, in silhouette, is

Loretta.

AT DOLORES

Ed runs over.  Dolores is beautifully made-up, and wearing a

furry angora sweater.  Ed speaks, awkwardly.

In a corner, standing by himself, is dumb TONY McCOY, Old Man

McCoy's worthless son.  He's a good-looking, moody hunk.  Tony

is practicing his lines from a script, but he's terribly stiff.

Dolores shakes her head contemptuously.  Then she strides off.

Ed stands alone, feeling bad.

ON STAGE

The set is a one-wall "office hallway": A doorway and a water

cooler.  Loretta sits in a make-up chair, as Harry works on

her.

Harry turns, surprised.  Dolores stands behind him.  There's a

thick tension.  He smiles anxiously.

Loretta frowns.  Ed quickly steps in.

Dolores nods sourly.  She s in a trouble-making mood.

INT. SCREENING ROOM - NIGHT

We're watching DAILIES.  Projected ON SCREEN, a camera

assistant claps the slate.  We hear Ed yell: "Action!"

Loretta hurries down the hallway.  Dolores sees her run past

and shouts out.

Loretta runs out.  Dolores just stands there.  We HEAR Ed:

"CUT!  PERFECT!"

Dolores turns deadpan to the camera.

The FILM runs out.

ON THE AUDIENCE

The screening room lights come up on the crew.  Ed sits in

gloomy haze.

Suddenly, there's loud CLAPPING from the back of the room.

INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT

Criswell turns to Ed.

EXT. REPUBLIC STUDIOS - NIGHT

The five men

Republic Studios.  Paul is panicked.

Ed smiles at Conrad.  Conrad shrugs.  Tor struggles.

Tor gives up, and simply BASHES through the locked gate.

Everyone is amazed.  Tor laughs.

They all sneak across the shadowy lot.  Remnants of old scary

sets tower over them.

OUTSIDE A SOUNDSTAGE

They reach a stage door. Ed tries it -- but it's locked.

A pause.  Everyone looks at Tor.  He grins.

Tor grabs the heavy door and easily SNAPS the lock.

INT. SOUNDSTAGE - SAME TIME

This place is

rocketships, a stuffed vulture... strange mysterious props from

untold movies loom everywhere in the darkness.

It's a place of wonderment and fear.

The men stare in awe.

Ed gestures above.  Everyone glances straight up.

THEIR POV

A giant OCTOPUS is lashed to the ceiling.

LATER

Conrad and Criswell are way up on the catwalk, holding onto

dangling Paul by his belt.  Paul leans way out, reaching for

the octopus.  He shouts nervously.

WIDE VIEW

Standing straight below is Tor.  The Swede has his arms

outstretched, waiting.

Ed supervises a good distance away.  He motions to Paul.

Paul gulps, then unties the octopus.

It drops incredibly fast.  The thing must weigh half a ton.

Tor's eyes widen.

And the octopus smashes straight on top of him.

BAM!

Tor is gone from sight.  One of the eight tentacles snaps off.

UP IN THE CATWALK

Criswell moans.

ON THE GROUND

Ed runs to the octopus and looks for Tor underneath.

A beat.  And then the octopus flips over.  Tor sits up,

battered but smiling.

EXT. REPUBLIC STUDIOS - NIGHT

The five men hurry across the lot, carrying the hubongous

octopus on their shoulders.

Suddenly, a FLASHLIGHT shines on them.

The men jump with fear.  They break into a fast waddling run.

The team runs through the busted gate and escapes.

EXT. STUDIOS - NIGHT

The Cadillac SCREECHES away.  The octopus flops on top of the

five men.

EXT. GRIFFITH PARK - NIGHT

The movie crew is setting up for a big night shoot.  Lights and

generators are sprawled across this isolated area.

Tony McCoy perches goofily on his own personalized chair.  He

runs lines by himself.

The octopus lays in a dried-up riverbed.  There's only about an

inch of water.  Ed yells at Conrad.

Ed storms away.  Conrad scratches his head.

IN A DUSTY PARKING LOT

Bela sits inertly in the back of an open car.  He weakly hails

over Ed.

Ed smiles warmly, then walks off.

Bela stares after him, then absent-mindedly searches through

his pockets.  Finally, he finds what he's looking for -- a

rubber tube.  Bela looks to make sure no one's around, then

ties the tube around his upper arm...

AT THE SET - LATER

Crew members have dammed up the end of the river, and Bunny

fills it with a hose.  There is now

Ed stands at the shore, admiring it.

Bela stumbles up, with a dazed smile.

Bela rolls up his pants and wades out, into the water.  He

screams.

A crew member throws Bela a bottle of Jack Daniels.

Bela pops the cap and chugs half the bottle in one swig.  He

licks his lips, then climbs onto the octopus.

Bela stares, deadpan.

The crew glances at Ed.

Bela takes another swig of J.D., then throws it off-camera.

Bela starts flailing around the octopus legs and SCREAMING in

horror.  This image is truly ridiculous.

Ed is pleased.

Some crew members nod: Pretty good.

Everybody cheers.

Then suddenly the dam walls BURST.

WHOOSH!  The water rushes from the lake and floods the park

below.

EXT. DINKY SOUNDSTAGES - EARLY MORNING

Crew members straggle in for the final shoot.  Everybody looks

bleary-eyed from last night.  Ed stands cheerily at the

entrance, greeting them.

Tony staggers up.

Ed sees Bela slowly shuffling along. Ed runs over to him.

Ed hands him the paper.  Bela starts reading it, as Ed watches

anxiously.  Bela is very touched.

Bela looks up.

INT. SOUNDSTAGE - DAY

They are shooting.  Ed watches off-camera, as Bela acts a

somber scene with an actor playing PROFESSOR STROWSKI, a

threatening European.

It's an incredible performance of crowning tragedy.  Bela is

totally drained.

CU - ED

He is very moved.  He whispers, barely audible.

INT. MEAT PACKING PLANT - NIGHT

The wrap party is being thrown in the meat packing plant.

People laugh and shout and carry on.  Tor pours booze in the

punch.  R&B MUSIC plays.  Old Man McCoy dances with Loretta.

Bunny dances with a young stud.  Dolores stands by herself.

Bela and Criswell are giggling.

They CLINK beers.

EXT. MEAT PACKING PLANT - SAME TIME

Outside, Vampira and two GIRL FRIENDS walk up.  They peer at a

tin sign.

They open the large steel door, and INSIDE is the wild bash.

INT. PARTY

Across the room, Paul and Conrad chat.

Dolores overhears this.  She stares in disbelief.

AT THE TURNTABLE

Someone changes the record.  Brassy STRIPPER MUSIC begins.

A door opens, and Ed struts out, in full gaudy drag.

Everybody turns.  They start WHISTLING and HOLLARING.

Ed grins, and starts into a wacky bump-and-grind.

Bunny runs up and sticks a dollar bill between Ed's fake tits.

People LAUGH hysterically.

Dolores is appalled.

Ed shimmies to the music, blowing kisses all around.  He sees

Vampira and waves.

Vampira's jaw drops in recognition.

Ed sashays up to Bela and dances a few steps with him.  The

music is building to a climax.  Ed hurries off to center stage

-- and as the MUSIC ENDS, he does a final swing of his hips,

then suddenly yanks out his teeth!

This brings down the house.  Everyone STAMPS their feet and

CLAPS crazily.

ANGLE - DOLORES

Everyone, except Dolores.  Suddenly, she explodes.

The room quiets.  Dolores has snapped.

The group is shocked.  Nobody speaks.

Dolores runs out of the party.

Ed just stands, dumbstruck.  Then he chases after her, in his

high heels and dress.

EXT. MEAT PACKING PLANT - SAME TIME

Dolores runs across the parking lot, in tears.  Ed catches up

with her.

Dolores stops.

She turns and walks away.  Ed is crushed.  He stands

motionless, in his dress, in the dark.

INT. ED'S NEW APARTMENT - DAY

Ed's new home is a single apartment, still filled with moving

boxes.  Half-eaten plates of food are scattered about.  Ed lies

asleep in bed, unshaven, in the middle of the day.

The phone RINGS.  Ed awakens and woozily answers it.

EXT. TOR'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Ed drives his Nash though a tract Valley neighborhood and

reaches Tor's little house.  Ed gets out, still looking groggy.

He walks up the tulip-lined path and rings the DOORBELL.

Clanging SWEDISH CHIMES bong inside.

The door flies open, and Tor appears, beaming.

Tor gives Ed a back-breaking hug.

INT. TOR'S HOUSE - SAME TIME

Ed steps in.  The house is filled with cuckoo clocks and little

Swedish knick-knacks.  Tor gestures proudly.

THREE COLOSSAL PEOPLE lumber out.  Tor has the largest family

we've ever seen.  Not fat -- but

gigantic Swedish wife, and KARL and CONNIE are their two

elephantine children.  They ADLIB greetings: "Hallo!"

"Welcome!" "Is a pleasure!"

Ed cannot believe what he's seeing.

INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Everyone noisily eats dinner.  The table looks like a

Smorgasbord.  Entire hams, turkeys, a full case of beer,

incredible quantities are being shoveled in.  Tor empties a

beer in one gulp, then opens another.

Ed is stupefied.  He picks at a little dainty serving.

All the Johnsons CHUCKLE.

Tor stands and hurries from the room.  Ed awkwardly makes

conversation.

Ed has no response.  Suddenly -- CRASH!  There's a loud o.s.

SLAM, falling porcelain, then Tor SHOUTS FURIOUSLY in Swedish.

Earl and Connie begin giggling. Ed is totally baffled.

Tor runs out, angrily holding a BROKEN TOILET SEAT.  It is

split in two.

Ed is boggle-eyed.  This house is sadness.

LATER

It's very late.  Tor and Ed sit in the living room, drinking

from a steaming pot of hot stilled wine.  They are smashed.

Tor finishes his glug, and then his eyes roll back into his

head, and he falls off the couch.  He starts SNORING.

Ed stares at Tor, then gets up.  Ed turns off the lights and

goes home.

INT. ED'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT

Ed smokes a cigarette and watches TV.

ON THE TV

Vampira is doing her shtick.

Vampira blows a kiss, then disappears into the mist.  A USED

CAR COMMERCIAL abruptly comes on.

ON ED

He stares at the TV, then picks up the phone.

INT. TV STUDIOS - SAME TIME

Vampira is walking off stage.  She removes her black wig.

A PRODUCTION ASSISTANT carries over a phone.

Ed pauses, nervously.

CLOSEUP - ED

Click.  The phone hangs up.  Poor Ed just stands there,

forlorn.

EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

Ed shuffles down the street, Mr. Lonely Guy, feeling sorry for

himself.

He glances in a coffee shop, and sees a sweet young woman

inside.  Her name is NORMA McCARTY.  She wears a bow in her

hair, Mary Jane shoes, and a fuzzy white angora sweater.

Ed's eyes widen.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - SAME TIME

Innocent Norma sits by herself, eating.

Norma looks up.  Standing over her is Ed, smiling.

Norma blushes.

INT. CRISWELL'S CADILLAC - NIGHT

Criswell and Paul drive at night.  They're dressed-up.  SWING

MUSIC plays on the radio.

They pull up to a GUARD GATE.  They're at a studio.

INT. SOUNDSTAGE - NIGHT

There is another rambunctious party in progress.  Crepe paper

streamers hang down.  Bela approaches Tor.

Suddenly Ed steps into the middle of the room.  He's extremely

handsome in his tuxedo, and beaming happily.

The crowd is stunned.

Many people DROP their glasses.

Ed proudly pulls out Norma.  She's in a wedding gown.

ON BELA AND TOR

They're bewildered.  Bela WHISPERS.

Ed walks over.  He hugs Bela.

Bela smiles -- trying to hide his total confusion.

LATER

The wedding is in progress.  The crowd is seated.  A MINISTER

performs the ceremony with Ed and Norma.

IN THE CROWD

Everybody is QUIETLY GOSSIPING.

AT THE ALTAR

The Minister is speaking to Ed.

Ed kisses Norma.

The crowd doesn't applaud.  They're too baffled by this whole

event.

THE RECEPTION

Everyone's drinking and dancing.  Ed proudly introduces Norma

to his buddies.

Criswell grabs Ed and pulls him aside.

Outside, a car HONKS.

Ed and Norma run out the door.  The crowd hurries after them.

OUTSIDE

Ed and Norma jump into his Nash.  It says "Just Married" and is

festooned with dangling tin cans.  The car screeches away.  The

cans RATTLE NOISILY, then slowly fade into the distance...

EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT

We're at a desert roadside motel, the San Bernardino Arms.  A

"Vacancy" light flashes.

INT. MOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME

Ed excitedly carries Norma over the threshold.  He throws her

onto the bed, and they start ardently making out.

He helps her remove her wedding dress.  She is very shy.

Ed removes his jacket, then gestures to his shirt.  Norma

nervously starts unbuttoning it.

Ed bites his lip in anticipation.

Norma opens the shirt... and

Norma is horrified.

EXT. MOTEL - SAME TIME

There's a loud woman's SCREAM.

Then the door slams open, and Norma runs hysterically out,

clutching her dress about her.

Ed runs out after her.

EXT. LOS ANGELES STREETS - LATE NIGHT

Ed drives sadly through the streets, alone.  His car still says

"Just Married," and the tin cans RATTLE behind him.

EXT. BELA'S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT

Ed's car pulls up.  Ed stumbles out, yanks off the tin cans,

and throws them in someone's trash.

Ed despondently approaches Bela's.  Inside, a light glows, and

the dogs BARK.

Ed is relieved.  Bela's awake.  He BANGS on the door.

He keeps BANGING.  Finally the door opens -- and Bela stands

there, shakily

and disturbingly haggard.

Bela weakly lowers the gun.

INT. BELA'S

Ed walks in, in a near-stupor.  Needles and drug paraphernalia

are scattered about

Frail Bela points the gun at Ed.  Ed is terrified.

Ed stares in anguish.

Bela drops the gun.  He starts weeping.

Ed walks over and hugs the shaking old man.

EXT. HOSPITAL - STILL LATER THAT NIGHT

Ed's car pulls up at the South Metropolitan State Hospital.

It's a grim, unwelcoming edifice.

Ed helps weak Bela from the car.  They look at each other, then

Ed gingerly leads Bela in.

INT. HOSPITAL - SAME TIME

The lobby is clammy and dim.  Ed and Bela reach the desk.  A

NURSE looks up, startled.

The nurse nods.  She takes Bela's arm and leads him away.  Bela

glances at Ed, then steps through a wide door.  As it swings

shut, we see a DOCTOR walk over and shake Bela's hand.

Ed stares at the door, dazed by all that's happened.  He sits

down in a chair, exhausted.

Ed's eyes slowly close, and he falls asleep...

INT. HOSPITAL - MORNING

Ed is still asleep, but now sunlight beats in.

Ed stirs and wakes up.  He groggily looks around, and sitting

across from him is a woman, knitting.  This is KATHY O'HARA,

26, solid, reflective, with a dry sense of humor.  Ed peers at

her.

Ed watches her knit.

Ed nods.  He spots the Doctor walk by.

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

We are outside Bela's room.  He can be glimpsed inside,

strapped to the bed and SCREAMING in pain.  He is going through

painful withdrawal and shakes horribly.

INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY - ANOTHER DAY

Ed strides into the hospital, wearing different clothes, and

carrying a box of chocolates.  He waves at the nurse.

Ed is puzzled.  He hurries back.

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

A crowd of NEWSPAPER REPORTERS and PHOTOGRAPHERS overflow

Bela's room.  Ed is astonished.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM

Decrepit Bela is propped up in his bed, as the mob of reporters

throw questions at hit and SNAP shots: "Bela, how long have you

been a junkie??" "Bela, look this way!"

Ed angrily pushes through.

Ed forces them out, then SLAMS the door.

Bela starts COUGHING heavily.  Ed stares sadly.

INT. LOBBY - ANOTHER DAY

Ed sits tensely in the lobby, holding vigil.  Kathy O'Hara

walks by.

Kathy reaches in her purse and pulls out two black booties.

She smiles.

Ed slowly smiles in response.  But this isn't his normal slick

smile.  It's gentler.  Sincere.

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY

Ed and the Doctor stand in a doorway, talking.

The Doctor shakes his head grimly.

INT. BELA'S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

Bela lies sleeping in bed, pasty and pale.  NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS

of his hospital stay are tacked up.

Ed anxiously tiptoes in.  He quietly speaks.

Bela stirs lethargically.  Ed puts on a fake smile.

Ed gingerly helps Bela up.

EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY

Bela slowly gets into Ed's car.

INT. CAMERA RENTAL HOUSE - DAY

Ed is desperately trying to cut a deal with the OLD MANAGER.

The old guy gives Ed a tough look.

EXT. BELA'S HOUSE - DAY

Bela is dressed in his Sunday finest, standing in front of his

little house.  He wears a cloak and a wide-brimmed hat.

WE WIDEN.  Out on the lawn... is just Ed.  With the camera.

Bela nods.  He mulls this over.

WIDE

Bela goes in the front door.  Ed gets behind the camera, then

turns it ON.

There's a moment.  And then Bela slowly steps outside, calm,

dignified, walking with a cane.  He looks about -- and then

something catches his eye.  He leans down and picks a flower.

Bela smells the flower, then abruptly drops it.  He starts

crying.  A pause, and then he composes himself.  The old man

slowly shuffles out of frame.

Ed peers emotionally from behind the camera.

Bela is pleased.

EXT. HOLLYWOOD DUPLEX - DUSK

Ed's Nash convertible pulls up outside a neat little duplex in

a nice neighborhood.  Ed is dressed up for a date.  He checks

his hair nervously in the mirror, revealing an anxious

boyishness we've never seen before.

Ed carries a bouquet of flowers to the front door.  He rings

the bell.  Kathy opens the door.  She looks very pretty in a

full skirt with a crinolin.

EXT. CARNIVAL - NIGHT

Ed and Kathy are at a tattered traveling carnival.  Rattling

steel rides and flashing lights spin about them.  They stroll

through the crowds eating cotton candy.  Kathy wears one of

Ed's flowers on her dress.

INT. SPOOK HOUSE - NIGHT

Ed and Kathy ride through the old mechanical spook house.

A wooden WITCH jumps out at them.  They ignore it.

A creaky GHOST flies overhead.

Ed freaks out.

WIDE

Mechanical BATS drop down and flap around them.

CLOSEUP - ED

He starts at Kathy in wonder.  He is overcome.

Their car SMASHES through the tin exit doors.

EXT. SPOOK HOUSE - SAME TIME

Ed and Kathy's little car comes to a stop.  He gets very

serious.

Kathy is amazed.  She contemplates all this.

Kathy slyly grins.

Ed grins back.  A moment.

INT. ED'S HOUSE - DAY

Ed is on the telephone.  We SPLIT-SCREEN with Vampira.

Vampira rolls her eyes.

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

Hundreds of KIDS and TEENAGERS enter a dilapidated second-run

theater.  A banner says "'Bride Of The Monster' World Premiere!

Celebrities In Person!"

EXT. DARK CITY STREET - SAME TIME

An antique limousine HEARSE drives down a dingy street.

INT. HEARSE

Ed drives.  Tor, ill Bela, Vampira, and Criswell are crammed in

with him, along with bewildered Kathy.

Everyone is dressed in gaudy "scary" outfits.  Tor wears his

frightening WHITE CONTACT LENSES.

Bela sheepishly removes his hand from her thigh.

INT. MOVIE THEATER - SAME TIME

The audience is so restless, they're practically rioting.  They

CLAP AND CHANT angrily.

A fat patronizing MANAGER steps on stage.

INT. HEARSE - SAME TIME

Tempers are flaring.

EXT. THEATER - SAME TIME

The hearse pulls up.  A FRANTIC USHER runs over.

The gang awkwardly steps out of the hearse.  Tor gets out and

blindly walks straight into a lamp post.  WHACK!  He yelps.

Bela moves slowly, very feeble.  Vampira smooths out her slinky

black dress, then puts her arm around Bela to help him.

INT. THEATER - SAME TIME

Criswell points Tor in the right direction, and the group

stumbles in.  Ed escorts excited Kathy.

The Usher opens the auditorium doors.

INSIDE

It's PANDEMONIUM.  People are screaming and shouting.  Kids jump

up and down, on top of the chairs.

Bela, Tor, Vaspira, and Criswell are alarmed.

The lights dim on and off.  Scratchy SPOOKY MUSIC blasts over

the sound system.

Criswell pushes blind Tor towards the stage.  Tor sticks out

his arms and scarily staggers down the aisle.  Criswell

nervously follows.  Vampira escorts Bela.

The crowd BOOS.  They pelt our gang with popcorn.

Tor GROWLS like a monster.  Kids LAUGH and jeer.

ON ED AND KATHY

In back, Ed speaks in a frightening manner into a MICROPHONE:

DOWN THE AISLE

Tor slips in some butter.  He tumbles and falls.

A WOMAN'S VOICE cackles.

Tor staggers to his feet.  All disoriented, he starts walking

the wrong direction and falls over a chair.  People HECKLE.

Criswell quickly helps his up.

Criswell pushes Tor in the right direction.  Some roughnecks

knock down Criswell and snatch his wallet.

A MEAN BOY jumps on his chair, ripping the stuffing out of the

seat.  He throws the fibers in the air, and they float over

Bela and Vampira.

A HIGH SCHOOL PUNK runs up and grabs Vampira's breasts.

She impulsively swings her arm and SLAMS the kid.

ON STAGE

The Manager pleads to the mob.

Somebody throws a bottle and HITS him in the head.  He goes

down.

WIDE

The lights suddenly go off.  Some girls SCREAM.

Ed's panicked.  He grabs Kathy and runs down to his friends.

Ed rounds up Bela, Tor, Criswell, and Vampira.

The crowd BOOS louder.  Blind Tor is totally confused.

The group runs up the aisle and leaves.  As the doors close,

"Bride Of The Monster" starts unspooling on the screen.

EXT. THEATER - SAME TIME

The gang frantically runs out, scared for their lives.

They look over.  Some JUVENILE DELINQUENTS are stripping the

hearse.

The theater doors CRASH open.  The angry mob pours out.

Ed spins wildly around... and sees a

Kathy runs frenziedly into the street and throws herself at the

cab.  It screeches to a halt.

Everybody sprints over and jumps in.  The cab ROARS away.

INT. CAB - SAME TIME

All of them are breathing heavily.  They watch in the rear

window as they drive away from the rampage.

A nervous silence.  Until Bela speaks.

All of them LAUGH.

EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - DAY

Bela and Ed stroll down the street, in high spirits.  Bela

smokes a big fat cigar.

Ed laughs.  Bela puffs his cigar.

Bela stops walking.  And in a BOOMING, THEATRICAL VOICE, he

suddenly launches into his impassioned, climactic speech from

"Bride Of The Monster."

Ed is touched.

A few people around them APPLAUD.

Bela's face lights up, proud.  An awed MIDWESTERN TOURIST hands

him a pen and paper.

Bela puffs out his chest majestically.

Bela turns and smiles wanly at Ed.

Ed smiles back.

INT. ED'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

Ed and Kathy stand in his kitchen, making dinner.  She sticks

her finger in a pot.

She holds a strainer.  Ed pours the spaghetti over it.

Suddenly the PHONE rings. Ed groans.

He listens.

And then, he gets a very somber expression.

Ed HANGS UP the phone.  He looks pained.

INT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY

It's Bela's funeral.

Ed sits crying in the front row, with Kathy at his side.

All Bela's friends are there.  They're very subdued.

THE CASKET

Bela lies inside, made up in his full Dracula outfit.  His hair

is died black, and he wears the famous cape.

EXT. HOLY CROSS CEMETERY - DAY

On a grassy hill, Bela is laid to rest.  The small crowd of

mourners stands silhouetted against the dark gray clouds.

The coffin is lowered into the ground.  Ed stands at the front,

silently watching.

AT A DISTANCE

A few TABLOID PHOTOGRAPHERS snap pictures.

INT. SCREENING ROOM - DAY

Ed is alone in a darkened screening room, depressed.

Playing on the SCREEN is the last footage of Bela: Bela

stumbles around in front of his house and smells the flower.

Ed drinks out of a flask.

The film runs out.  A VOICE comes over a loudspeaker.

Ed silently nods.

INT. ED'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Ed's apartment has gone to hell.  Ed is in a robe, unshaven and

clutching a bottle of whiskey.  Newspapers are everywhere.

Bela's and Ed's dogs eat out of the trash.

Kathy tries to straighten things up.  Ed stares listlessly.

EXT. ED'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

A new Studebaker pulls up.  A bumper sticker says "JESUS SAVES"

A man in a plain brown suit steps out.  This is J. EDWARD

REYNOLDS, 50, Ed's santironious southern Christian landlord.

Reynolds assertively bangs on Ed's front door.

The door opens a crack.  Bleary Ed peers out.

INT. APARTMENT - SAME TIME

Ed motions Reynolds in.  Reynolds peers unsurely at the tornado

inside.  Then he notices a framed one-sheet for "BRIDE OF THE

MONSTER."  Reynolds admires it.

ANGLE - ED

His eyes suddenly pop.

The color comes back to his fact.  A plan is quickly boiling

over inside Ed's head.  He starts feverishly pacing around.

Ed randomly grabs a script off the messy floor, then glances

down, to see which one he picked up.  It says "Graverobbers

From Outer Space."

Reynolds scratches his head.

Ed grins maniacally.  He grabs a SMALL REEL of 35mm film.

A beat.  Reynolds stares, intrigued...

INT. ED'S APARTMENT - LATER

The place is cleaned-up.  Ed shouts excitedly into the phone.

Paul sticks his head in.

Ed hangs up.

Paul leads in THREE.  They look

a HOMELESS BUM, one is a SHORT FAT MAN, and one is CHINESE.

Ed inspects them.

Paul turns to go.

INT. KATHY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Kathy reads a newspaper while knitting an angora sweater.  Ed

is typing deliriously fast -- in one of his artistic fevers.

Kathy suddenly jumps up, shocked.

She runs over and shows Ed the newspaper.

INSERT - THE NEWSPAPER

A small headline says "VAMPIRA REVEALED TO BE RED."  Underneath

is the story: "Channel 7 has fired popular horror hostess

Vampira, after learning of her suspected communist leanings..."

ON ED AND KATHY

They're astonished.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

Ed and Kathy sit with a shaken-up Vampira.

Vampira smiles uncomfortably.

DR. TOM MASON, a tall, slender 35-year-old chiropractor,

strides over.  He smiles.

Dr. Mason grabs Kathy's neck and CRACKS it loudly.

ON ED

Ed stares at the Doctor in astonishment.  Ed is riveted.

Ed excitedly jumps up, takes his NAPXIN, and covers the

Doctor's face from the nose down.

INT. BAPTIST CHURCH OF BEVERLY HILLS - DAY

Services are in progress.  J. Edward Reynolds leads a CHOIR

singing an emotional SPIRITUAL.

Ed, Tor, Criswell, Paul, Conrad, Vampira, Kathy, Bunny, and Dr.

Tom Mason sit in back.  They're all wearing white robes and

arguing about the doctor.

Kathy lifts Dr. Mason's robe over his bewildered face.

Everybody CRACKS up.  Ed waves his arms.

Like bad kids, they quiet down.  Ingenuous Southern REVEREND

LYN LEMON speaks up front.

EXT. BACKYARD - DAY

The straight-laced, devout CONGREGATION is gathered around a

large SWIMMING POOL.  Reverend Lemon, Reynolds, and our misfits

stand in the shallow end, in their white robes.

Criswell whispers to Vampira.

MONTAGE:

THE REVEREND BAPTIZES ED

Reynolds DUNKS Ed in the water.

THE REVEREND BAPTIZES BUNNY

Reynolds DUNKS Bunny.

THE REVEREND BAPTIZES TOR

Tor winks slyly at Criswell.

Reynolds DUNKS Tor.  But Tor slips from Reynolds' grasp and

sinks to the bottom of the pool.

Tor lies on the bottom, staring lifeinsly.

The whole Congregation starts JUMPING IN.  Men and women in

their Sunday finest leap into the pool and start tugging on

Tor.  But nobody can budge the big whale.

ON TOR

He suddenly rises, Poseidon-like, from the pool.

Tor spits out water, then lets out a hearty BELLY LAVGH.

The Baptists aren't amused.

INT. CITY BUS - MORNING

A bus drives along.  Every PASSENGER stares at something up

front -- Vampira,

"Grave Robbers From Outer Space" script.

EXT. SCUMMY NEIGHBORHOOD - SAME TIME

The bus stops in a scary, run-down neighborhood.  Vampira

off and warily looks around.

She nervously walks down a dingy alley.  Vampira gets to an

unmarked grimy door, gulps, then slowly opens it...

INT. WAREHOUSE SOUNDSTAGE - DAY

And inside is the "Grave Robbers From Outer Space" famous

CEMETERY SET!  The film is in production!  Packed into a

stinking little studio are a few scrawny twigs, branches, and

flimsy cardboard tombstones set against a black drop.

Tot struts about gregariously, in his "Inspector Clay" suit.

He chats up the CREW.

The Baptists chase Ed around.  They wave the script.

Ed shakes his head.

CEMETERY SET

They're filming the COPS arriving at the pitch-black cemetery.

There's a prop police car, and an assistant blows fog in.

Tor steps onto the set

ON THE CREW

Everybody grices, trying to understand Tor.  The SCRIPT GIRL

shakes her head.

The Baptists angrily pull Ed aside.

ANOTHER SCENE BEING SHOT - LATER

As Inspector Clay, Tor wanders around the "cemtery," waving

his flashlight and nervously fingering his gun.

Ed grins at the Baptists.

The door of a large paper-mache crypt creeps open.  Dr. Tom

uncertainly steps out, impersonating Bela.  He holds the cape

over his face and stalks Tor.

Ed is pleased as punch.  He whispers to the Baptists.

Vampira steps out, walking in a trance.  Tor is now cornered.

He fruitlessly FIRES his gun, but bullets can't stop zombies.

Vampira and Dr. Tom kill him.  Tor screams.

ANOTHER SCENE GETS SHOT - LATER

Paul and Conrad are scared cops exploring the cemetery.

Off-stage, a grip on a ladder pans a 10K SEARCHLIGHT.

The LIGHT crosses the actors.  They look up in horror, then

clumsily fall down.  A rickety fake tombstone tips over.

Ed suddenly flips out.  He's livid.

A STRAPPING YOUNG MAN walks up.  He smiles at the Baptists,

Ed spastically storms away.

INT. DRESSING ROOM - SAME TIME

Ed bursts in.  He paces about, hysterically traumatized.

Ed glances at a clothing rack -- and sees an ANGORA SWEATER.

Ed is taken aback.  He slowly removes it from the hanger and

rubs it against his face.  His breathing slows.

INT. SOUNDSTAGE - SAME TIME

The dressing room door flies open.  Ed slowly struts out,

ease.

The stage quiets.  People are staring.

The crew resumes working.  But the Baptists charge up, aghast.

Ed throws up his hands.

EXT. SOUNDSTAGE - DAY

Ed frantically marches out of the building.  He's still in his

ladies' outfit.  Ed sees a cab and WHISTLES loudly.

The cab pulls over.  Ed jumps in.

INT. MUSSO & FRANKS - DAY

The place is quiet, mid-morning.  Frazzled Ed enters and sits

at the bar.

The bartender nonchalantly pours a shot.  Ed takes the drink.

He quietly sips his booze and reflects upon his day.

Ed glances around. And then, suddenly -- his eyes widen.

Sitting at a table is ORSON WELLES!  The portly, world-famous

filmmaker sits alone, eating lunch with one hand and drawing

STORYBOARDS with the other.

Ed is thunderstruck.

Ed nervously stands.  He starts to step forward -- when he

catches his own reflection in a mirror.  He's still in drag.

Ed rolls his eyes.  He runs his hand through his hair, then

slowly approaches Orson Welles.  Ed is terrified.

Ed is astonished.

Ed shakes his head.  He's discouraged.

CLOSEUP - ED

He has seen God.

INT. SOUNDSTAGE - DAY

Ed bursts onto the stage, a changed man.  Re-energized, he

confidently grabs the Baptists.

Reynolds and Rev. Lemon are speechiess.

CLOSEUP - ED

He beams, turns and SHOUTS TRIUMPHANTLY into the soundstage.

himself from the grave.

Ed and his stock footage buddy watch a moviola.

SOUNDSTAGE

Harry paints Bunny's face GREEN, like a Martian.  Ed yells.

crossing gesture.

foggy cemetery.

Off-stage, Ed stands with the crew.  He shouts gleefully.

END MONTAGE.

EXT. CITY - NIGHT

It's pouring rain.  Standing in the drench is Ed.  He's wearing

a tux, and fighting with his open convertible top.  The

Rambler is filled with water.

Kathy stands under an awning.  She wears a pretty gown.

Ed impulsively opens the car door.  Water pours out.  Kathy

scurries out and jumps in the wet car with him.

EXT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

The rain is gushing down.  The marquee proclaims "WORLD

PREMIERE: PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE!"

People hurry in.  Ed and Kathy roar up in the open convertible,

totally soaked.  He jumps out, opens her door, and they run

inside.

INT. THEATER - NIGHT

The theater is packed.  All the gang, and their friends and

families, are gathered.

Criswell stands on-stage, speaking into a mike.

The crowd ERUPTS in applause.  Everybody goes crazy -- even the

Baptists.  People YELL "Speech! Speech!"

Ed smiles proudly.  Kathy kisses him.  Ed runs down front, hugs

Criswell, then takes the microphone.

The lights dim.

MINUTES LATER

The title "PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE" is projected onto the

screen.  As random IMAGES from the film play out, we drift over

the happy faces of our friends watching.

Paul and Conrad stare, enthralled.

Tor laughs as he sees himself.

Vampira giggles.  Bunny nudges her playfully.

Criswell mouths his own lines.

ON SCREEN

Bela appears, in his little suit.  In the last footage he ever

shot, he shuffles around in front of his house, then tenderly

smells the flower.

ON ED

He watches, entranced.  Then he smiles to himself.

INT. THEATER LOBBY - LATER

The BOISTEROUS crowd is in high spirits.  People congratulate

Ed and pat him on the back.  "It was great!"  "It's your best

one yet!"  "Bela would've loved it!"

Ed drifts through the crowd, basking in the glory.  It's like a

wonderful dream.

EXT. THEATER - SAME TIME

The rain comes down in sheets.  The doors burst open, and Ed

and Kathy run out.

Kathy stares in disbelief.  Then she smiles.  They kiss.

Ed and Kathy jump into the open convertible.  The engine

starts, and they drive away, disappearing into the pouring

rain.

A moment.

And then, we move up, up, into the black clouds.  Lightning

CRACKS across the sky.

We slowly PULL OUT from the sky, move through a window... and

we're back inside

INT. HAUNTED MANSION PARLOR - NIGHT

Criswell is sitting inside his coffin.  He stares at us.

A beat, to ponder this.  And then Criswell slowly lies back in

his coffin, and the lid mysteriously closes over him.
