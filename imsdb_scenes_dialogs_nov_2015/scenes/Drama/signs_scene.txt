"SIGNS"

FADE IN:

INT.  WINDOW - MORNING

We are looking out a second story window of a house.  The

backyard is large and green with a wooden jungle gym, worn

from use.  A single tree throws shade onto a barbecue and a

picnic table.

The backyard is lined by crops.  Corn.  Golden and brown.

Six feet high.

Everything is perfect.  Like a postcard.  And then we HEAR A

CHILD SCREAM.  IT'S FAR AWAY.  WE DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'S

COMING FROM.

INT.  BEDROOM - MORNING

GRAHAM HESS wakes up from his sleep.  He thought he heard

something.  He listens.  HE HEARS THE HEATER.  THE

REFRIGERATOR DOWNSTAIRS HUMMING.  THE OCCASIONAL BIRDS

OUTSIDE CHIRPING.

Graham climbs out of bed.  He moves in his pajama pants and

white Barron's minor league baseball T-shirt towards the

bedroom door.

INT.  HALL LANDING - MORNING

Graham stands in the hall landing where three bedroom doors

meet.  He moves to the door that has children's drawings

taped to it.  He puts his ear close.  Listens.  Beat.

He relaxes.  Graham leans down and picks up two balled up

sweat socks and a child's sweater from the hallway floor.  He

puts it in the hallway hamper before heading back into his

bedroom.

INT.  BATHROOM - MORNING

A bathroom door is open.  WE HEAR THE SINK RUNNING.  WE HEAR

THE SOUNDS OF TEETH BEING BRUSHED.

Outside the bathroom on the bedroom wall is the sun faded

outline of where a large CATHOLIC CROSS used to hang.  It's

ghostly stained forever on the blank wall.

A CHILD SCREAMS FROM FAR AWAY.

The water from the sink stops.  Graham steps into the

doorway.  Toothbrush and foam in his mouth.  He becomes very

still.

INT.  CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - MORNING

The bedroom door bursts open.  Graham steps into his

children's room.  There are children's books everywhere.

Overflowing off shelves.  Piled in corners.

Graham's eyes move to the small messy beds.  They're both

empty.

INT.  GARAGE BEDROOM - MORNING

WE HEAR THE VOICES OF TWO CHILDREN NOW.  THEIR SCREAMS FLOAT

INTO A DARKENED BEDROOM OVER THE GARAGE.

MERRILL HESS throws the bed sheets off himself as he swings

onto his feet in one quick motion.  He is hyper-awake.

Merrill is in his late twenties.  He is well build.  His

muscles are tense as he stands in his red bikini briefs and

looks around bewildered.

EXT.  BACKYARD - MORNING

Graham bangs open the back screen door and runs into the

backyard.  He spins as he looks around.

Merrill, now with a T-shirt and jeans, rumbles down the side

stairs adjacent to the garage building.

Merrill and Graham make eye contact as they approach each

other across the yard.

Graham looks around -- panic growing in his eyes.

Graham and Merrill in unison turn in the direction of the

YELLING.  They look away from the house, across the yard and

into THE THICK WALL OF CROPS.

EXT.  CROPS - MORNING

The tall stalks of corn smack Graham and Merrill's faces as

they run through the crops.

A LITTLE GIRL appears in the crops thirty feet ahead of them

like an apparition.  She is in her nightgown.  She is four.

They reach her fast.  She stands unaware of them in a daze.

Her hair is messed from sleep.

BO stands peacefully lost in her thoughts.  Beat.

Bo finally looks at her father.  Beat.  She smiles softly.

Beat.

Graham looks in the direction of THE BOY'S VOICE.  He's

close.  Graham picks up Bo and rushes through the crops.

He finds MORGAN standing with his hands in the pockets of his

pajama bottoms.  DOGS ARE BARKING NEARBY.

Graham puts Bo on the ground and moves right in front of

Morgan.  The ten-year old boy looks deep in thought.

Graham takes hold of Morgan's chin and turns his face so he's

looking straight at him.

Beat.  Morgan's eyes reveal he's come to some answer.

Beat.  THE DOGS KEEP BARKING.

Morgan takes hold of his father's unshaven chin and turns his

face.  Graham is forced to look to his right.  Beat.  Graham

sees something.

Graham Hess slowly rises to his feet.  He starts moving

forward towards something.

He walks through a thin layer of crops and emerges in a

clearing.  Two German Shepherds are running back and forth.

They are clearly agitated.

Graham looks around at the THOUSANDS OF CORN STALKS LYING

FLAT ON THE GROUND.  THEY LAY IN A GIGANTIC CIRCLE, A HUNDRED

FEET WIDE.

Graham Hess looks around in a daze as he walks out into the

center.  Merrill, Bo and Morgan follow him.

The dogs keep running and barking as WE PULL BACK AND REVEAL

THE FOUR MEMBERS OF THE HESS FAMILY STANDING IN THE MIDDLE OF

THIS PERFECT, GIGANTIC CIRCLE.

WE KEEP PULLING BACK TO EXPOSE THIS EERIE DESIGN -- FIVE

HUNDRED FEET WIDE -- SITTING IN THE MIDDLE OF AN ENDLESS,

UNTOUCHED CORN FIELD.

LEGEND:

EXT.  BACKYARD - LUNCHTIME

Graham holds his hand over the barbecue to see if it's at the

right temperature.  The other hand holds a cordless phone to

his ear.

Graham stokes the coals with a LONG BARBECUE FORK.

Graham moves around from behind the barbecue and heads

towards the house.

Beat.

Graham steps through the back screen door into his

KITCHEN.

Graham holds the phone a little closer and talks in a HUSHED

VOICE.

Graham turns off the phone.  He turns to put it on the

counter and realizes his children are seated on the kitchen

floor with one of their two German Shepherds.  There is a

LARGE PUDDLE on the kitchen tiles.

Graham looks at the majestic dog.  It's shivering.

Morgan and Bo lead their dog out with worried expressions on

their faces.

Graham grabs a handful of paper towels and places it on the

puddle of urine.  The DOORBELL rings with Graham still on his

knees on the kitchen floor.  He leans back so he can see down

the hall.

A balding police officer stands on the other side of the

screen door.

OFFICER EDGAR PASKI nods that he knows.

Beat.  Graham stares at Officer Paski.

EXT.  BACKYARD JUNGLE GYM - LUNCHTIME

Bo walks from the house with a large glass of water.  She

moves to Houdini, who sits in the shade by the picnic table.

Morgan pokes the barbecue fork into two meat patties on the

grill.  He places two pieces of cheese on the hamburgers,

before walking over to Houdini.

The two children sit down in the grass with the dog.

Bo is about to pour the glass of water into the dog bowl.

She stops.  Takes a tiny sip of the water first.

She holds the glass out to Morgan.

He drinks.

Bo shrugs and pours it into the bowl.  Beat.

Houdini just sits staring at them.  He is not shivering.  He

doesn't drink.  He is unnaturally still.

Bo pushes the bowl closer.

HOUDINI MOVES...

BO'S HAND PULLS BACK...

HOUDINI'S JAWS SNAP SHUT IN THE AIR WHERE HER HAND USED TO

BE.  HE WAS JUST A FRACTION OF A SECOND LATER...

BEAT.  The children turn white.

HOUDINI BEGINS TO GROWL.  Bo stands up.

Houdini crouches down.

THE DOG'S GROWL BECOMES DEEP, MENACING.

The German Shepherd trembles.  His body tightens.  He's about

to leap.  Beat.

EXT.  CROPS - LUNCHTIME

Officer Edgar Paski stands facing Graham fifty feet away.

They are on opposite ends of the crop circle.  Beat.

The crops all around them sway as the wind blows.  Beat.

Officer Paski yells over the wind.

They stands in awkward silence fifty feet away from each

other.  Beat.

EXT.  CORN CROPS - LUNCHTIME

Officer Paski's knee touches the ground.  He points to a

single stalk of corn laying flat on it's side.

Graham stands next to him and leans in.  The joint where the

stalk bends from the ground is a perfect "L".

Graham looks around at the hundreds of thousands of corn

stalks bent over each other in a perfect wave.

Beat.

Graham, nods in agreement.  Officer Paski stands up.

We see a thought catch in Graham's eyes.  He turns back and

stares in the direction of the house.  You can barely see the

roof over the crops.  Beat.

The two men stand as the wind blows lightly around them.

Officer Paski notices the still expression on Graham's face.

Beat.

EXT.  BACKYARD - LUNCHTIME

Morgan watches the thin line of smoke rising from the charred

patties on the grill next to the overturned picnic table.

Morgan's attention moves as the crops part and his father and

Officer Paski enter the backyard.  They stop cold when they

look in his direction.  They begin a slow walk towards him.

Morgan Hess is seated under the jungle gym with Houdini on

his lap.  Morgan is petting Houdini's fur gently.  Bo is on

top of the jungle gym curled up in a ball.

As Graham and Officer Paski get closer, they see Morgan is

crying.

Then they see the dog is laying on it side and has a BARBECUE

FORK DEEP IN ITS NECK.

Beat.

They stare at Morgan as he slowly pulls an inhaler from his

pocket and brings it to his mouth.  He inhales the asthma

spray.  Beat.  He lowers the inhaler so he can speak.

Beat.  Graham stares at his ten-year old son.

Beat.  Morgan nods, "No."  His tough exterior breaks as his

face starts to tremble.  He starts crying.  Graham picks him

up in his arms.

Graham reaches up for Bo.  She has dirt and tears on her

face.  Beat.  She slowly climbs down.  Graham carries both

his children as they cry in his arms.

He starts towards the house.  Merrill walks out from the back

holding a bowl of food.

Merrill sees Houdini lying under the jungle gym.

Merrill stands still with potato salad in his hands.  He

nods.

The children watch over their father's shoulder as Merrill

runs to their other German Shepherd sitting quietly near the

house and leads her by her collar across the yard to the

shed.

Graham reaches the porch of his house and opens the screen

door.

The last thing the children see as they enter the house, is

the image of Officer Paski pulling the barbecue fork out of

their dead dog's neck.

INT.  BEDROOM - LATE EVENING

Graham lies in bed.  He rests his cheek against the pillow as

he lies by himself.

Graham stares off.  Beat.  He smiles a little.

EXT.  HOUSE - NIGHT

The large Hess farm house sits in the moonlight.

A MILLION CRICKETS AND BUGS FILL THE NIGHT AIR WITH SOUND.

THEY SUDDENLY STOP.

AN UNNATURAL SILENCE FILLS THE YARD.

INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

Graham opens his eyes slowly as he stirs from his sleep.  His

daughter Bo stares at him from the edge of the bed.  She is

five inches away from his face.

Graham gets startled.

Beat.

Graham slowly gets up from the bed.  He takes his daughter's

hand and starts out of the room.

Graham leads his four-year old daughter down the darkened

hall.

INT.  CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Morgan's body is half off his bed.  Graham gently lifts him

back onto the pillow and covers him up.

There are two glasses of water on Bo's bedside table.  Graham

moves to Bo's bed.  He sits on the edge of it.  She stares

back at him as she holds her panda.

Beat.

Beat.  They both sit quietly for a moment.

Graham's eyes drift to the bedroom window.  A LARGE

SILHOUETTED FIGURE STANDS ON THE ROOF IN THE DARKNESS AND

STARES AT HIM.

THE FIGURE MOVES.  HIS SHADOW PASSES OVER THE CHILDREN'S

BEDROOM AS HE JUMPS FROM THE ROOF.

Graham stands.  He looks to his daughter with startled eyes.

INT.  FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

GREY SNOW FILLS THE SCREEN.  Merrill sleeps in front of the

family room television.

A hand gently shakes him.  Merrill wakes and looks up at his

brother zipping up his overcoat.

EXT.  FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

Merrill quickly puts on his boots at the front door.

Merrill opens the front door.  It's pitch black outside.

Merrill turn to Graham and gestures with his fingers.

Merrill brings his fingers together at the end of a circle.

Beat.

They HEAR MOVEMENT OUTSIDE.  Merrill and Graham look out into

the darkness.

Merrill and Graham go out the front door in opposite

directions.

EXT.  MERRILL'S SIDE OF HOUSE - NIGHT

Merrill is in a full sprint.  He hugs the side of the

building as he runs.

EXT.  GRAHAM'S SIDE OF HOUSE - NIGHT

Graham runs through the darkness around the first corner of

the house.  He waves his arms.

Graham spots a LARGE FIGURE darting around the corner ahead

of him.

EXT.  MERRILL'S SIDE OF HOUSE - NIGHT

Merrill turns a corner full speed.  THE LARGE FIGURE HAS COME

TO A STOP IN THE SHADOWS AHEAD OF HIM.  HE SEEMS TO BLEND

INTO THE DARKNESS WHEN HE'S STILL.

Merrill charges.  WE JUST MAKE OUT MOVEMENT IN THE DARKNESS

AS THE FIGURE DISAPPEARS AROUND THE CORNER.

EXT.  SIDE OF HOUSE - NIGHT

Graham and Merrill come screaming around two corners and come

to a stop facing each other.  Beat.

They look around, panting heavily.

Graham's eyes drift above them.

They follow the roof around the corner.  They find themselves

in the backyard.

Their eyes catch movement away from the house.  They just

catch A GLIMPSE OF THE LARGE FIGURE as he disappears into the

crops.  The swing on the swing set is still moving from being

hit.

They stare across the yard silently.  ALL WE HEAR IS THEIR

HEAVY BREATHING.

EXT.  PORCH - DAY

Officer Edgar Paski stands on the porch with his note pad

open.  He faces Graham and Merrill.

Beat.

Graham and Merrill stare at Edgar Paski.

They keep staring.  Edgar closes his pad.

The three men stand in the doorway.  Edgar opens his pad.

Morgan walks up to the front door.  He holds up a baby

monitor.

The three men follow Morgan into the house.  They pass

through the family room where Bo stands at the television.

She is staring at the screen.  ON THE SCREEN IS AERIAL

FOOTAGE FROM A HELICOPTER.  THE FOOTAGE IS OF A LARGE FIELD

WITH ENORMOUS CIRCLES AND DIAMONDS CARVED INTO ITS CROPS.

Bo changes the channel.  She finds a cartoon.  She sits down

on the sofa.

Morgan and the men, can't see the screen, and move into the

KITCHEN.

Graham opens one of the cabinets and pulls down some

batteries.  He hands them to Morgan.

Graham starts out of the kitchen.

They all move into the

FAMILY ROOM.

Bo watches cartoons.  THE CARTOON MUSIC AND CARTOON PRAT

FALLS FILLS THE ROOM.

Bo nods and moves to the television.  The pack of men follow

Graham up the

STAIRS.

They arrive on the landing and follow Graham into his

bedroom.  He moves into his

BATHROOM.

They all move in with him.

Graham takes the clock radio from the sink.  Tries to open

the back.

Graham waves the radio.  The men and Morgan move out of the

bathroom.

They moves down the STAIRS.

They move through the FAMILY ROOM.

Bo's cartoon is replaced by a special report news icon.

Bo starts looking around the couch.

Graham stops before entering the kitchen.  The group stops

with him.  He looks at Bo searching the couch.  He walks over

to the television.

There are three glasses of water on the TV set.  He stands

next to the set.  Doesn't see what's on the screen.

Bo stops looking through the sofa cushions and looks to her

father.  Looks at the glass.

Beat.  Bo turns back to her search.  Graham tucks the clock

radio under his arm and collects the three glasses.  He heads

towards the kitchen.

They follow Graham and Morgan through the swinging door into

the KITCHEN.

Graham puts the glasses in the sink with a group of other

half-filled water glasses and opens the drawer to pull out a

screwdriver.  He starts opening the clock radio.

Graham looks at Edgar.

Morgan hands Graham the baby monitor and Graham starts

replacing the batteries.

Graham hands Morgan the monitor.  He turns it ON.  THERE IS A

STATIC CRACKLE WITH SPIKES OF SOUND.

Morgan heads out of the kitchen.

Edgar nods.

Beat.  Merrill walks out of the kitchen.  Graham watches

Edgar think it over.

INT.  FAMILY ROOM - DAY

Graham moves to a windowsill where more glasses of water sit.

He picks them up.  Sees two more on the coffee table.  He

gives up and puts the two glasses back on the windowsill.

Morgan sits with his monitor next to Bo, who quietly watches

the TV.  Merrill and Graham squeeze in next to Morgan.

Officer Paski walks towards the windows.  Graham, Merrill and

Morgan follow him with their eyes.  Officer Paski walks next

to the television.

ON THE SCREEN WITH THE SOUND ALMOST MUTED, IS AN AERIAL SHOT

FROM A HELICOPTER.  A DIFFERENT ONE THAN BEFORE.  THE FOOTAGE

IS OF A VAST FIELD OF CROPS.  THERE ARE TWO DIAMONDS FLANKING

TWO SIDE OF A TRIANGLE IN THE CENTER OF THE FIELD.

Officer Paski turns to them.

Graham, Merrill and Morgan stare at the screen.

Edgar comes around to see the screen.

WE ARE ON A TV SCREEN.  THE CROPS SWAY IN THE BREEZE.

A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE ARE WAVING FROM THE DIAMONDS ON THE

FIELD.

Bo gets up.

She presses the up arrows on the TV controls.

The television report cuts to Columbia University PROFESSOR.

Morgan takes the asthma inhaler from his pocket and breathes

in deeply.

Beat.

THE ROOM GOES SILENT as everyone watches the images on the

television screen.

EXT.  HESS DRIVEWAY - DAY

The two men walk down the driveway to Edgar's patrol car.

Edgar turns back to Graham.

Edgar stares at Graham.

EXT.  STATION WAGON - AFTERNOON

WE MOVE THROUGH BACK ROADS OF BUCKS COUNTY.  RURAL

PENNSYLVANIA IN ITS MOST BEAUTIFUL.  TREE LINED STREETS.

WHITE PICKET FENCES.  APPLE ORCHARDS.

The Hess family rides in their station wagon.  Graham drives.

Merrill is shotgun.  The children are in the back.

Morgan leans forward and TURNS ON THE RADIO.

CLICK.  Graham TURNS IT OFF.

Morgan nods and then plops back into the backseat.

EXT.  MAIN STREET - AFTERNOON

Downtown Bucks County.  A group of small stores along a quiet

street.

The Hess station wagon pulls in front of a free parking

meter.

Graham steps out the driver's side and looks around.  Merrill

puts change in the meter.

Morgan walks up to Graham with Bo.

Morgan holds out his hand.  Graham gives his son a look as he

reaches into his back pocket.

Morgan takes the money Graham gives him, then takes Bo's hand

and walks down the sidewalk.

Graham watches them turn into a store.

Merrill steps onto the sidewalk.  Hands in his pockets as he

walks away.

Graham turns and calls after him.

Merrill waves over his shoulder.  He keeps walking.

Graham starts across the street to the pharmacy.

INT.  NATHAN'S BOOKSTORE - AFTERNOON

A mom and pop bookstore.  Three isles wide.  MR. AND MRS.

NATHAN, a couple in their early seventies, sit behind their

counter and watch a black and white TV.  The PICTURE ON THE

TELEVISION IS OF A WHEAT FIELD.  THREE ENORMOUS TRIANGLES

SURROUND A CIRCLE.

Morgan steps up to the counter.

Morgan shrugs.  Mrs. Nathan pushes her husband aside.

Mrs. Nathan points over to the far corner.

INT.  PHARMACY - AFTERNOON

Graham waits at a white counter.  A gum chewing PHARMACIST in

her early twenties, who looks like she's in her teens,

glances through back shelves of medicines as she listens to

the radio.

The Pharmacist looks back at Graham and then reaches up and

TURNS OFF THE RADIO.  She quietly finds the prescription on

the shelf and moves to the counter across from Graham.

She doesn't ring it up.  She just stands there fiddling with

the bag holding Morgan's medicine.  Beat.

Graham stares at the girl.  Beat.  He nods "yes."

Beat.  Graham leans forward on the counter and takes the

girl's hands in his.  He talks very slowly.

Beat.  When Tracey speaks her VOICE IS A BIT SHAKY.

Graham looks at the young girl's teary eyes.  He exhales

slowly.

INT.  ARMY RECRUITING OFFICE - AFTERNOON

Merrill stares up at a poster with a muscular guy in an Army

uniform standing at attention on a beach.

We are in a narrow ARMY RECRUITING CENTER.  Inside the small

storefront space is a desk.  A gentleman sporting a CREWCUT

sits behind it.

A young man, Merrill's age, sits at a side card table filling

out some forms.

Merrill realizes the crewcut guy is talking to him.

The crewcut guy savors the beat of silence.

It takes a second, but Merrill smiles.  The crewcut guy

smiles back.  Merrill points at a poster.

The crewcut guy reaches to a stack of brochures.  Picks the

top brochure and hands it to Merrill.

The crewcut guy begins to stare at Merrill closely.

Merrill looks up from the brochure.  Beat.

Merrill not, "yes."

Beat.

Merrill turns to the young man, about his age, who sits at

the folding table.

LIONEL smirks.

Beat.

Beat.  Merrill tucks the pamphlet in his jacket.  Looks like

he's not going to say anything.  When he does, the words are

soft and worn; they've been said a hundred times.

Beat.  The crewcut guy shakes his head.  Merrill turns and

starts walking.

As he passes Lionel, Merrill makes a small, quick move in

Lionel's direction, like he might hit him.  Lionel flinches

and covers his face.

Merrill walks out the door of the army recruiting office.

INT.  PHARMACY - AFTERNOON

Graham glances at the girl as she sits sideways to him at the

counter.

Graham's eyes widen.

Graham looks around the empty store for help.

INT.  NATHAN'S BOOKSTORE - AFTERNOON

Bo sits at a tiny reading table and drinks a glass of water.

There is another glass, half-full, on her table.  Mrs. Nathan

watches as the little girl takes careful sips.

Beat.  Bo looks up with a grimace.

MRS. NATHAN YELLS TO MR. NATHAN AT THE FRONT OF THE STORE.

Morgan doesn't look up from the extraterrestrial book.

Bo shrugs.  She places the glass she sipped on the table with

the other glass.

Mrs. Nathan stares at the four-year old.

Everyone turns to the front of the store where Mr. Nathan

points to the TV screen.  A Coke Cola commercial is on.

Beat.  Mrs. Nathan turns back to find Morgan holding out the

extraterrestrial book to her.

EXT.  STATION WAGON - AFTERNOON

Merrill, Morgan and Bo are waiting in the parked car.  Beat.

The driver's side opens and Graham sits in.

Beat.  Everyone nods, "yes."

Graham puts the key in the ignition and turns the car on.

Merrill watches as Graham's hand goes to put the car in

reverse -- and then stops.

Graham is staring out the windshield.  Merrill follows his

stare to a thin, thirty-year old man in a LEATHER JACKET

coming out of a store.  Merrill's face changes expression

too.  They both stare as the man passes in front of the car.

Everyone in the car watches the man in the leather jacket as

he steps off the sidewalk towards the truck.  It's here that

he notices the stares.  He glances up to see the faces

watching him from the station wagon.

The leather jacketed man keeps moving to his truck.  He gets

in, turns it on, and without looking over to the station

wagon, backs out of the parking lot.

Beat.  The Hess family sits quietly.

Nobody says anything for the longest time.

Graham puts the station wagon in reverse and backs out into

the street.

EXT.  HESS HOME - AFTERNOON

THE SKY IS GOLDEN RED.  The crops sway hypnotically in a

gentle breeze.

The Hess station wagon pulls into their driveway.  It comes

to a stop in front of the house.  The engine goes off.  No

one gets out.

INT.  STATION WAGON - AFTERNOON

All four sit quietly not getting out.

A MUFFLED SPIKE OF NOISE IS HEARD FROM THE BACK SEAT.

Graham and Merrill turn and see Morgan pull the baby monitor

out of his jacket.  He holds it in his lap.

Beat.

Beat.

THE MONITOR SPIKES WITH A SUDDEN CRACKLE.  MORGAN PULLS IT

AWAY FROM HIS EAR.

Morgan turns a knob on the side.

THE VOLUME SUDDENLY JUMPS UP ON THE MONITOR.  WE HEAR BEEPS

IN THE STATIC.  THE RED LIGHTS ON THE FRONT OF THE BABY

MONITOR LIGHT UP WITH EACH BEEP.

Morgan hands Graham the monitor in the front seat.  THE BEEPS

COME AND GO AS THEY GET COVERED BY THE STATIC.

Beat.  Nobody gets out of the station wagon.

Graham pulls the handle.  His door opens.  He waits before

getting out.  The other three station wagon doors open right

after.

OUTSIDE CAR

Graham stands and closes his driver side door.

THE MONITOR CHANGES SOUNDS.  THE BEEPING DISAPPEARS.  THE

STATIC BECOMES LOUDER, BECOMING A MOVING, SWIRLING SOUND

TEXTURE.

Everyone becomes frozen, standing next to the station wagon.

Three of the doors are open.

IN THE TEXTURE OF SOUND, JUST FOR A MOMENT, WE HEAR SOMETHING

THAT SOUNDS LIKE...

Everyone stares at the baby monitor in Graham's hand.

Graham doesn't move his arm.  He keeps it out in the air

where he had it as he closed his door.  Graham looks to

Merrill over the roof of the station wagon.

THE SWIRLING TEXTURE SOUND FLOATS THROUGH THE AIR ABOVE THE

STATION WAGON.

Beat.  Graham moves.  He hands the monitor over the hood.

Merrill reaches for it.

THE SWIRLING, MOVING TEXTURE BECOMES LOUD AND FILLED WITH

UNINTELLIGIBLE NOISES.

Graham and Merrill freeze -- both touching the monitor over

the roof of the station wagon.

WE HEAR SOMETHING THAT SOUNDS LIKE A VOICE EMERGE AND THEN

QUICKLY FADE AWAY.

Merrill concentrates on THE SWIRLING MOVING TEXTURE COMING

FROM THE BABY MONITOR.

Graham looks around at his rapt family.

Graham looks at Merrill, who's now one of them.  Beat.

Morgan is the first one to move.

He moves from the back passenger door to the back bumper

where he begins to climb onto the station wagon.

Morgan crawls on the roof and takes the monitor ever-so

gently out of Graham and Merrill's outstretched hands.

Merrill climbs up over the side and joins Morgan on the roof.

Merrill keeps a hand on his nephew.  Morgan raises the

monitor above his head.

THE RED LIGHTS ON THE BABY MONITOR ALL TURN ON.

THE SWIRLING TEXTURE COMING FROM THE MONITOR BECOMES

SOMETHING MORE MECHANICAL, LIKE THE HUM OF LARGE EQUIPMENT IN

THE DISTANCE.

THE VOICE LIKE SOUNDS ARE UNDER A CRACKLE BUT ARE CLEARER AND

LOUDER.

Bo runs to the front bumper and climbs onto the hood.

Graham cuts her off by taking a seat on the hood.  He takes

hold of Bo.  All four are on the car now.

Morgan stands up on the roof of the station wagon.  Merrill

holds him by the waist.

Bo tries to get up onto the roof by climbing over Graham and

the windshield.  Graham boosts her up over his head with both

hands.

Merrill reaches out his free hand.  Bo reaches out to him.

THE SOUND FROM THE MONITOR SUDDENLY CHANGES.

Everyone STOPS exactly where they are.  Graham holds Bo over

his head.  Bo reaches out to Merrill.  Merrill sits on the

roof with one arm out.  Morgan stands with the baby monitor

raised high in the air.  The Hess family remains very still

on the hood of their station wagon as they listen.

THE CRACKLING IS GONE.  THE VOICE-LIKE SOUNDS ARE CLEAR AND

UPFRONT.  THERE ARE TWO DISTINCT TONES IN THE MIX.

THE VOICE-LIKE SOUNDS ARE NOT WORDS BUT MORE LIKE GRUNTS AND

GURGLING LIKE SOMEONE DROWNING.  THE SOUNDS ARE BEING CREATED

BY INHALES, NOT EXHALES.  A SEQUENCE OF THESE SOUNDS IN ONE

TONE IS FOLLOWED BY SILENCE AND THEN THE SECOND TONE BEGINS

ANOTHER SEQUENCE LIKE A CONVERSATION.

Graham struggles to hold Bo up.  Bo struggles to keep her

arms out.  Merrill struggles not to turn his face to the

incredible SOUNDS ABOVE HIS HEAD.

THE TONES ESCALATE IN VOLUME.

Morgan's eyes widen as THE SEQUENCE OF SOUNDS BECOMES SHORTER

AND FASTER.  THE TONES BECOME HARDER, ANGRIER.  THE SILENCES

ALMOST GONE.

THE VOICE-LIKE TONES REACH A LOUD FEVERISH PACE, ALMOST

VIOLENT AND THEN WE HEAR A CLICK AND THEY'RE GONE.

Beat.  Everyone looks up at the baby monitor.  The red lights

are off.  ONLY THE BLAND HUM OF NORMAL STATIC COMES FROM IT'S

SPEAKER.

Beat.

Graham brings Bo down into his lap.  Morgan takes a seat next

to Merrill on the roof.  The Hess family sits like mental

patients on the top of their station wagon.

EXT.  BACKYARD - EVENING

WE ARE AT THE EDGE OF THE CROPS LOOKING BACK AT THE HOUSE.

The LIGHTS are on in the kitchen.  We see Graham, Merrill and

the children doing dishes after dinner.

The DOG IS BARKING FURIOUSLY.

OUR VIEW TURNS TO LOOK AT THE BARN THROUGH THE CROPS.

Isabelle, the remaining German Shepherd is tied to a post

outside the barn.  The dog whips back and forth frantically.

She keeps looking in our direction.

WE HEAR A SCREEN DOOR OPEN.  WE TURN TO LOOK BACK AT THE

HOUSE.  Graham steps out the back screen door with a bowl of

dog food and a bowl of water.

We watch him as he walks towards the frantic dog.  When he

gets close, Graham slows.  He approaches the dog carefully.

He places the two bowls close but not too close.  The dog has

no interest in them.  She keeps barking and glaring in our

direction.

Graham watches her for a few moments, and THEN TURNS AND

LOOKS DIRECTLY AT US FROM ACROSS THE YARD.

WE PULL BACK INTO THE DARKNESS OF THE CROPS.

EXT.  BARN - EVENING

Graham stands frozen looking across his yard.  Isabelle, the

dog turns in desperate circles behind him.  Graham's eyes

stay focused on the same point in the darkness.  He talks to

no one.

Beat.  Graham starts to move.

Graham reaches the barbecue area.  There's a flashlight on

the picnic table.  Graham TURNS THE FLASHLIGHT ON.  A NARROW

BEAM FALLS ON THE GRASS FIVE FEET AHEAD OF HIM.

Graham starts toward the crops.

THE BEAM OF LIGHT FALLS ON THE WALL OF CORN CROPS LINING THE

BACKYARD.  Graham steps right up to them.  He hesitates and

then steps into the field of

CORN CROPS.

We can't see two feet in any direction.  Six foot stalks of

corn line Graham on all sides.  THE FLASHLIGHT THROWS A

WAVERING BEAM ON THE CROPS AHEAD OF HIM.

THE BEAM OF HIS FLASHLIGHT FINDS A NARROW PATH.  Graham

starts following it.  His shoulders brush crops on either

side.

SOMETHING MOVES UP AHEAD.

Graham stops.  HE SHINES HIS LIGHT DOWN THE PATH.  Nothing

but crops disappearing into darkness.

THERE'S MOVEMENT RIGHT NEXT TO HIM.  Graham spins and aims

the FLASHLIGHT AT THE CROPS TO HIS RIGHT.  THE LIGHT ONLY

PENETRATES A FEW FEET INTO THE CROPS.

Beat.  There is no response.  GRAHAM CAN HEAR HIS OWN

BREATHING... IT SOUNDS HEAVY, ECHOISH... LIKE THERE'S TWO OF

HIM.

Beat.  Graham holds his breath.  THE SOUND OF SOMEONE ELSE

BREATHING CONTINUES BEHIND HIM.

Graham turns and drops the FLASHLIGHT at the same time.  THE

BEAM OF LIGHT TURNS OFF WHEN THE FLASHLIGHT HITS THE GROUND.

GRAHAM IS IN DARKNESS NOW.  HE LOOKS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE

BREATHING.  BUT CAN'T SEE ANYTHING.  HIS OWN BREATHING IS

FAST AND LOUD NOW.

Graham kneels down and gropes in the darkness.  His hands

search over the ground in all directions.  They finally touch

the flashlight.  Graham quickly fumbles with it to find the

"on" button.  He does.

A BEAM OF LIGHT SHOOTS ACROSS THE GROUND.  SOMETHING POWDERY

WHITE STANDS FIVE FEET AWAY.

It instantly moves into the darkness.  Graham tries to get

up.  He stumbles backwards into the crops.  He's tangled in

crops as he struggles to rise.  He gets up and starts

running.

Leaves and stalks slap him from all directions.  He panics.

He doesn't know where he is.  THERE IS SOMETHING COMING

BEHIND HIM.

Graham makes a sudden right turn.  He puts his hands in front

of him to protect his face and eyes.  He's running as fast as

he can.  HE HEARS STALKS OF CORN BREAKING BEHIND HIM.

Another sudden turn, this time left.  Graham emerges into his

BACKYARD.

Graham keeps running across the yard.  ISABELLE BARKS

FRANTICALLY.

When Graham reaches the porch stairs, he stops and turns.

There is no one behind him.  The wall of crops fifty feet

away sway in the gentle night breeze.

Graham gains control of his breathing.  He turns and walks to

the screen door, slowing his breathing down with each step.

INT.  KITCHEN - EVENING

Graham steps into the kitchen.  His hair is messed.  His

shirt has a few leaves from corn stalks stuck to it.  He

locks the back door.

The children don't notice his presence.  They're splashing

each other at the sink as they clean the dinner dishes.

Graham looks through the kitchen doorway to the family room.

He sees Merrill there.

Merrill's hands are in his pockets as he stares at the WOODEN

BASEBALL BAT mounted above the fireplace.  Merrill doesn't

notice him either.

Graham takes two steps to the kitchen table and slowly takes

a seat.  His breathing is a slow controlled pant.  He runs

one shaky hand through his hair as he gathers himself and

thinks.  His kind eyes stare down at the ground as he slows

his mind.  Beat.

Merrill is the first to notice him.  He moves from where the

baseball bat is hung, into the kitchen.  As he passes the

children at the sink, he turns off the faucet.

The children stop playing and look up to Merrill.  They

follow his stare to the kitchen table.

Beat.  Graham looks up at them.

INT.  FAMILY ROOM - EVENING

THE TV GOES ON WITH A CLICK.  THE SCREEN BLOWS WHITE AND THEN

IMMEDIATELY DARKNESS.  OUTLINES AND SHAPES EMERGE.

THE SOUND POPS ON.

THE SCREEN FILLS WITH CRISP BLACKS.  WE ARE WATCHING VIDEO OF

A NIGHT SKY OVER A DENSE CITY.  THE THOUSAND LIGHTS OF THE

CITY FILL THE BOTTOM OF THE SHAKING IMAGE.

ANOTHER SET OF LIGHTS DOT THE SKY ABOVE THE CITY.  THEY ARE

ARRANGED IN TWO "V'S" SIDE BY SIDE.

Bo puts her finger to the screen and counts the hovering

lights.

Morgan, Merrill and Graham stand silently before the

television set.

Beat.

Beat.  Everyone just watches the fourteen lights hovering on

the screen.

Morgan reaches into the pile of video tapes under the

television stand.  He grabs one.

Bo snatches the video as Morgan tries to put it into the VCR.

Morgan stares at his sister.

Graham doesn't take his eyes off the screen.

Graham and Merrill sit down at the same time on the sofa.

They both have the same dazed, slow movements.

Morgan rummages through the pile of videos frantically.  He

finds one and reaches for the VCR.

Morgan slams the tape marked "Bay Watch" into the VCR and

presses record.  He's breathing heavy now.  Wheezing

actually.

Morgan moves to the sofa and takes a seat in between his

father and his uncle.  Bo walks over and squeezes in also.

The four of them stare at the television.

Beat.

Morgan brings his asthma spray to his mouth and inhales.

INT.  FAMILY ROOM - MIDNIGHT

The family room lights are off now.  The TV is still on.  The

SOUND IS MUTED.  There are a couple glasses of Bo's water on

the television now.

The fourteen lights are still hovering on the screen.  Morgan

is asleep on Graham's lap.  Bo is asleep on Merrill's

shoulder.

Graham turns his sleepy eyes away from the screen to Merrill.

Merrill looks his brother in the eyes.  Beat.

Beat.  Graham thinks it over.

Beat.  Merrill is deep in thought.

Merrill looks at the TV screen.  Beat.

Graham smiles.

Beat.

Beat.

The two of them turn back to the silent screen of the

television.  It's a long beat before Graham speaks.

Beat.  Merrill turns and stares quietly at his brother.

Merrill's mouth opens a bit.  Graham turns and chuckles at

his expression.

Merrill nods, "No."

Graham turns back to the television.  Beat.

THE LIGHT OF THE TELEVISION FLICKERS ON THE FACES OF THE TWO

BROTHERS AS THEY SIT WATCHING IN SILENCE.

INT.  FAMILY ROOM - DAY

Graham's eyes open.  DAYLIGHT FILLS the family room.  He is

alone on the couch.  Alone in the room.

He looks to the television.  It's not there.

Graham moves to his feet and look around the room.  His eyes

stop on an EXTENSION CORD that runs from a wall outlet in the

family room, across the front hall, and under a closet door.

Graham moves to the door.  WE HEAR MUFFLED TELEVISION VOICES.

Graham opens the

CLOSET.

Merrill looks up.  He's seated on a kitchen chair with the

television on a roll-away stand crammed in with him.

Beat.  Graham looks at the TV screen.  There's a daylight

shot of Mexico City.  The skies are empty above it.

Merrill puts a finger in the sky on the screen.

Merrill's finger trails to the bottom of the screen.

Graham looks at the empty sky on the screen with different

eyes.

INT.  MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

We are inside Graham's bedroom facing his bathroom door,

which is closed.  The same sun-faded outline of where a large

cross used to hang, is stained on the wall next to the door.

Graham opens the bathroom door and steps out with wet hair.

He towels it dry as he moves to his bedroom window.

WE LOOK OUT THE SAME WINDOW WE LOOKED OUT AT THE VERY

BEGINNING.

The backyard is large and green with a wooden jungle gym.  A

single tree throws shade onto a picnic table.  The back of

the yard is lined by corn crops.  Golden and brown.  Six feet

high.

The crops go on well beyond our view.  Graham stares at them

quietly.  Watching.

Beat.  THE SOUND OF WHISPERING DRAWS HIS ATTENTION FROM THE

WINDOW.

He listens closely.  HIS CHILDREN ARE WHISPERING IN THE NEXT

ROOM.

INT.  CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - DAY

Graham walks into the hall and looks in their room.

Morgan and Bo are seated on the edge of their bed.  They have

TIN FOIL wrapped around their heads like a helmet.  Graham

stares at his children.

Morgan holds up the book he bought from Nathan's bookstore.

Graham enters the room.  The children make space for him on

the bed.  He takes a seat between them.  Morgan puts the book

on his father's lap.

Graham looks on the back cover for a picture.  There's none

there.

Morgan closes the book.

Bo points at the book.

Graham looks at his two children with foil on their heads.

Beat.  Morgan puts the book on his father's lap.

Beat.  Morgan opens the tome.

Beat.  Graham acknowledges with a nod that he did have a

tone.

Morgan turns the page.

Graham looks at an illustration of a small, bulbous headed

figure shaking hands with a bearded human.

Morgan turns the page.  There is a picture of a house.  A

space ship is hovering over the home shooting laser beams at

it.  Beat.

Morgan and Bo lean in closer to look at the picture.  Beat.

The three of them study the picture of the house.  It's on

fire.  Their eyes move to the front yard.  There are three

bodies lying dead on the front lawn.  Two are children.

THE PHONE RINGS.

The children SCREAM and cling to their father.  THEIR SCREAMS

DIE DOWN.  The PHONE RINGS again.  Graham gets up.  He closes

the book.

Graham steps out into the hallway.  He tucks the book under

his arm and picks up the phone.

THROUGH THE PHONE WE HEAR SUDDEN SCUFFLING, A CHAIR SQUEAL

AGAINST THE FLOOR and then the phone disconnects.

NOTHING BUT DEAD AIR.  Graham looks at the receiver and then

slowly hangs it up.

Graham walks down the hall to a small window.

The window looks down the driveway and out onto the road.

Graham stares into the distance.  About a half-mile away we

see the TIP OF A HOUSE.  Graham gazes at it for a beat.

INT.  FRONT HALL - DAY

Graham comes down the stairs with his overcoat on.  He moves

to the closet door and knocks on it before opening it.

Merrill looks up from the television.

Merrill nods.

Graham starts down the hall.  Merrill steps out of the closet

for the first time.  He looks down the hall shocked.

Graham unlocks the front door.

INT.  CHILDREN'S BEDROOM - DAY

BLUE SKY -- OUR VIEW MOVES OVER CLOUDS.  WE ARE LOOKING

THROUGH SOME KIND OF LENS.

Morgan pulls his eye away from the telescope that is set up

on the window seat in his room.

Bo nods, "Yes."

Bo nods, "Yes" slowly.

Bo hugs Morgan tight.

Bo keeps hugging Morgan.

Beat.  Morgan peels Bo's arms off of him.

Bo lets go.  Morgan puts his eye to the eyepiece of the

telescope.

EXT.  REDDY HOUSE - DAY

A mailbox reads "R. Reddy."

There is a gray and white house at the end of the quarter

mile driveway.  We saw the roof of this house from the Hess

hallway window.

Graham stands at the front door and RINGS THE DOORBELL AGAIN.

Beat.  Graham tries to look inside.  Curtains block his view.

Graham walks around the porch.  Turns the corner of the

house.  He looks in a side window.

THE VIEW THROUGH THE WINDOW IS OF A KITCHEN.  THE KITCHEN

CHAIRS ARE ON THEIR SIDE.  THE KITCHEN TABLE ITSELF, IS

UPSIDE DOWN, LEANING AGAINST A CLOSED DOOR.  THE ROOM IS

TOTALLY WRECKED.

Graham stands straight up.  He looks around nervously.  He

takes two steps back towards the front of the house and the

safety of his station wagon before he notices the GREEN TRUCK

parked to the side of the house.

There is someone sitting in it.

EXT.  REDDY DRIVEWAY - DAY

The passenger side window of the truck is open.  Graham steps

up to it and looks inside.  The thin man with the leather

jacket, we saw in town, sits behind the wheel.  He stares out

the windshield.  He is covered in sweat.

RAY REDDY doesn't look over.  Doesn't react.  Keeps staring.

Ray clutches the steering wheel tightly, turning his knuckles

a yellow white.

Graham glances to the backseat of the truck.  There are two

large bags over flowing with clothes.

Graham's eyes gently move back to Ray and drift down to the

TWO BLOOD STAINED AREA ON HIS SHIRT.  Beat.

Beat.  Ray doesn't look over when he speaks.

Tears start falling down Ray's face.

Ray finally turns.  His red face quivers as he talks.

Ray starts the car.

Beat.

Ray looks at Graham.

The two men stare at each other for a beat.  Ray looks away.

He puts the car in drive.

Graham steps away as the truck moves forward and pulls down

the driveway.

INT.  CLOSET - DAY

Merrill's head is leaned against a bunch of winter coats.

His eyes are closed.

Merrill's eyes open.

THE TELEVISION ANCHOR APPEARS FLUSTERED.

Merrill sits up in his chair.

THE PICTURE OF THE ANCHORMAN IS REPLACED BY A HANDHELD VIDEO

IMAGE ON THE TV SCREEN.  THE IMAGE IS OF A FAMILY ROOM WHERE

A BUNCH OF CHILDREN IN DRESS CLOTHES CROWD AROUND A SLIDING

GLASS WINDOW.

THE CHILDREN ARE SPEAKING PORTUGUESE EXCITEDLY.  THEY LOOK AT

THE CAMERA AND POINT TO THE OUTSIDE THROUGH THE GLASS DOORS.

THE HANDHELD IMAGE MOVES OVER THEIR SHOULDERS TO LOOK OUT

THROUGH THE GLASS INTO A CRAMPED BACKYARD.  THERE IS A

RECTANGULAR TABLE WITH PARTY DECORATIONS AND AN UNTOUCHED

BIRTHDAY CAKE ON IT.  COLORFUL BALLOONS FLOAT AROUND THE

BACKYARD.  THERE IS NO ONE OUTSIDE.

THE IMAGES PANS AROUND THE DENSE FOLIAGE THAT FORMS A WALL

AROUND THE YARD.  THE IMAGE ZOOMS AND SEARCHES IN THE

DARKNESS OF THE BRANCHES.

The chair in the closet CREAKS as Merrill leans forward a

little towards the television screen.

WE HEAR A BURST OF PORTUGUESE.  THE IMAGE PANS AWAY FROM THE

GLASS DOORS BACK INTO THE HOME.  WE LOOK DOWN A NARROW HALL

TO THE KITCHEN.  A BOY WITH A BIRTHDAY HAT IS SEATED ON THE

KITCHEN COUNTER, POINTING FRANTICALLY OUT THE KITCHEN WINDOW.

HE YELLS IN PORTUGUESE.

THE CROWD OF CHILDREN AROUND THE GLASS DOORS START RUSHING

INTO THE KITCHEN.  THEY ARE JOINED BY A FEW ADULTS.  THE

IMAGE FOLLOWS THEM IN.

THE KITCHEN WINDOW IS BLOCKED BY HEADS WHEN WE FIRST ARRIVE.

THE IMAGE FINDS AN OPENING OVER THE SHOULDER OF THE BOY WITH

THE BIRTHDAY HAT AND ANOTHER CHILD.

WE ARE NOW LOOKING OUT THE KITCHEN WINDOW.  WE SEE A NARROW

ALLEY ONLY A FEW FEET WIDE CREATED BY A STONE WALL AND A

SMALL GARAGE BUILDING.  ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL IS

DENSE FOLIAGE.  THE WALL ENDS A FEW FEET AFTER THE GARAGE

BUILDING.

WE HEAR THE CHILD'S VOICE VERY CLOSE TO US SPEAKING IN

PORTUGUESE.  THE CAMERA PANS JUST A LITTLE AS THE FACE OF THE

LITTLE BIRTHDAY BOY FILLS THE SCREEN.  HE TALKS EXCITEDLY

DIRECTLY AT US AND AT SOMEONE BEHIND THE IMAGE.

THE BOY GESTURES TO THE GARAGE BUILDING.  THE IMAGE SETTLES

BACK ON THE WINDOW.  WE STARE AT THE NARROW ALLEY.  THE IMAGE

ZOOMS A BIT.  SEARCHES THE EDGE OF THE GARAGE BUILDING.  THE

IMAGE STARTS WIDENING OUT.

AND THEN WE SEE IT.

THE KITCHEN ERUPTS WITH CHILDREN'S SCREAMS AS A LARGE NON-

HUMAN FIGURE MOVES FROM THE GARAGE BUILDING TO BEHIND THE

WALL.  IT'S OUT OF SIGHT IN LESS THAN A SECOND.

Merrill is frozen like a statue.  His mouth is open a little.

The closet FILLS WITH THE PANDEMONIA OF THE KITCHEN ON THE

VIDEO.

THE VIDEO IMAGE ON THE NEWS, PAUSES.  BEAT.  WE SEE IT

REWIND.  WE SEE THE FIGURE ZIP BACK BEHIND THE GARAGE IN A

FLICKER.  THE VIDEO STOPS.  PLAYS AGAIN.

THE IMAGE ZOOMS A BIT.  SEARCHES THE EDGE OF THE GARAGE

BUILDING.  STARTS TO WIDEN OUT.  THE KITCHEN STARTS TO FILL

WITH SCREAMS AS THE FIGURE APPEARS... THE IMAGE FREEZES.

THE NEWS HAS PAUSED THE VIDEOTAPE ON THE EXACT MOMENT THE

NON-HUMAN FIGURE IS VISIBLE.  IT'S HALFWAY ACROSS THE ALLEY.

IT'S MOTION HAS BLURRED IT, BUT YOU CAN TELL ITS SHAPE NOW.

Merrill Hess stares stunned at the IMAGE OF AN UPRIGHT ANIMAL

LIKE CREATURE.  THE STRIATIONS ALL OVER ITS BODY LOOK LIKE

BRANCHES.  EXACTLY LIKE BRANCHES.  THEY MATCH THE BUSHES

WHERE IT WAS HIDING, PERFECTLY.

INT.  KITCHEN - DAY

The door swings open slowly.  Graham steps into Ray Reddy's

kitchen.

Cabinets are open.  Dishes are broken.  Chairs are turned

over.  The faucet is running full blast.

Graham's eyes move across the room.  The kitchen table is

upside down and leaned up against the pantry door.

THE SOUND OF A GLASS JAR BREAKING ON THE GROUND CAN BE HEARD

INSIDE THE PANTRY.

Graham takes a few conservative steps to the middle of the

kitchen.

He leans a little bit and listens.  From behind the pantry

door WE HEAR THE SOUND OF BREATHING.  THERE ARE QUIET

MOVEMENT SOUNDS.  THE SOFT SOUND OF GLASS BEING CRUSHED AS

IT'S BEING WALKED ON.

Graham can almost see the bottom of the door around the

leaning table.  Graham stands up straight and thinks it over.

Beat.

Graham takes two small steps closer.

When he leans, he can now see the entire bottom of the pantry

door.  THERE IS LIGHT LEAKING OUT FROM BENEATH IT.  THERE IS

SHADOW BEING THROWN FROM INSIDE THE PANTRY.  THE SHADOW MOVES

BACK AND FORTH UNDER THE DOOR.

THE SHADOW STOPS MOVING.

Beat.

SILENCE.  There is no movement from the pantry.  Beat.

THE ONLY SOUND IN THE KITCHEN IS THE SOUND OF THE FAUCET

RUNNING.  Graham waits for a reply, but none comes.

Beat.

Graham bends down where he stands.  He puts his head near the

wood floor.  He tries to look under the door.  All he can see

are the bottoms of a couple shelves in the corner of the

pantry.  He's at too severe an angle.

Graham sits up.  He's only four feet away from the pantry

door.  He looks around not knowing what to do.  His eyes fall

on a bunch of kitchen knives that have spilled from a drawer

onto the floor.

He takes a butcher knife from the group and moves closer to

the door.  Beat.  He reaches with the butcher knife

underneath the slanted kitchen table.  He uses the knife like

a mirror to see under the door.  Graham watches the SOFT

REFLECTION IN THE FLAT STAINLESS STEEL SURFACE OF THE BLADE.

WE CAN MAKE OUT BROKEN GLASS AND RIPPED OPEN PACKETS OF RICE

AND CEREAL ON THE GROUND.  THERE ARE POCKETS OF SHADOWS WE

CAN'T SEE INTO.

Graham pulls the knife out.  He sits there kneeling two feet

from the door.  Beat.

He takes a deep breath and starts to lower his head under the

slanted table.

He stops halfway down.  He loses his nerve and sits up.  He

rises to his feet as he places the butcher knife on the

counter.  Graham starts walking across the kitchen.  He gets

to the door.  Puts his hand on the doorknob.

He stays like that for a long time.  Beat.

Graham lets go of the doorknob -- He turns and walks quickly

across the kitchen -- He picks up the butcher knife -- He

kneels down next to the pantry -- He ducks his head under the

slanted kitchen table -- He places his cheek to the floor,

only inches from the bottom of the door, and looks into the

pantry.

There is broken glass and rice throughout the wooden floor of

the pantry.  Nothing else.

Graham stares at his VIEW OF THE FLOOR.  Something's wrong.

Parts of it feel like a painting.  THE PAINTING MOVES.

TWO BLACK EYES OPEN -- SEEMINGLY SUSPENDED IN THE MIDDLE OF

THE ROOM.  THEY ARE SIDEWAYS.  THEY LOOK AT GRAHAM.

GRAHAM YELLS.  HE JOLTS UP.  HIS HEAD HITS THE SLANTED TABLE

HARD.

FOUR LONG FINGERS AND CLAWS, THE EXACT COLOR OF THE WOODEN

FLOOR REACH OUT AND MISS HIS FACE BY A FRACTION OF AN INCH.

GRAHAM REACTS.  THE BUTCHER KNIFE COMES DOWN FAST AND HARD ON

THE PROTRUDING WOOD COLORED FINGERS.  SLAM!

WE HEAR AN UNBEARABLY HIGH-PITCHED INHALE SOUND FROM INSIDE

THE PANTRY.

EXT.  STATION WAGON - DAY

The station wagon knocks over the "Ray Reddy" mailbox as it

turns sharply onto the road.

Graham picks up speed as he passes the wall of crops on his

right.

THE STATION WAGON SUDDENLY BRAKES.

Two black skid marks form on the road as the station wagon

comes to a fast stop.

Beat.  Graham gets out of the car.  He walks a few feet ahead

of the station wagon.  He bends down in the middle of the

road.

A BIRD lays limp on the asphalt.  Its head is crushed.

Graham gazes at the still pile of feathers.  Beat.

Graham turns and looks straight up at the BLUE, CLOUDLESS SKY

above him.

INT.  HESS FAMILY ROOM - DAY

Graham enters his front hall.  He closes the door and locks

it behind him.  He turns and looks into the family room.

Morgan and Bo and Merrill are seated together on the sofa.

All three are wearing foil helmets.  Beat.

Graham stares at his family huddled on the couch.  Beat.

Graham takes in the news as he moves to the stairs.  He takes

a seat on the second to last step.

He sits obscured by the balusters.  Beat.

The words hang in the air.  Graham sits quietly on the second

step of the stairs.

Beat.

No one raises their hand.

All four put their hands in the air.  Beat.  They lower them

and sit in silence.

Beat.

EXT.  HESS HOUSE - AFTERNOON

WE ARE WATCHING THE HOUSE FROM THE CROPS.  We see Graham

inside the house, closing the window shutters in one room

after another.

WE SEE a stack of wooden boards on the porch.

OUR VIEW MOVES to the barn where Isabelle is tied.  She is

not pacing.  She is not barking.  She sits staring right at

us.  She is shivering.

OUR VIEW MOVES to the garage building where we see Merrill

carry a huge pile of his clothes and things down the stairs.

He's moving into the main house.

Merrill walks across the yard.  His eyes look around

carefully as he moves.

Part of the pile in his arms falls to the grass as he crosses

the lawn.  He stops walking and starts to gather up the

fallen things.  He picks up a couple shirts and two baseballs

encased in glass cases.

The glass encasing one of the souvenir baseballs, has

cracked.  He takes the ball out.  Stares at it.

We watch from the crops as Merrill puts down his pile of

clothes and things on the grass.  He looks around and finds

what he's looking for.  A rake.

Merrill unscrews the fork on the rake from the wooden handle.

With the wooden stick in one hand and the souvenir baseball

in the other, he turns to face the crops.

WE PULL BACK A LITTLE INTO THE CROPS.  PART OF OUR VIEW IS

OBSCURED BY STALKS, BUT WE STILL SEE MERRILL CLEARLY.

Merrill looks around cautiously again, before getting into a

batter's stance.  His left leg digs into the grass in front

of him.  His weight is mostly on his back leg.  He looks out

into the distance high over the crops.  He throws the

baseball up in the air...

Merrill grabs the wooden handle.  Merrill's shoulders move

with blinding speed.  The wooden rake handle slices the air.

And misses the ball.

The ball drops at Merrill's feet.

WE WATCH as Merrill picks up the ball and tries again.  This

time his shoulders move even faster.  The wooden stick

actually makes A RESONANT SOUND as it cuts the air.

The ball drops at Merrill's feet.

WE WATCH THROUGH THE CROPS as Merrill snatches the ball up

and tries a third time.  This time he YELLS as he swings.  He

rips the air with the wooden stick so fast it blurs to the

eye.

The baseball drops at his feet.  Strike three.

Merrill stands still in the yard.  He's breathing a little

heavy as he stares down at the ball.

He gently picks it up.  He walks back to his pile of things

and then suddenly turns.  He throws the ball in the air as he

does.  His left leg goes out.  His weight goes to his right

leg as he turns his shoulders with astonishing speed and

power...

THE SOUND OF THE BASEBALL HITTING THE WOODEN HANDLE CRACKS

ACROSS THE WHOLE YARD.

The ball rockets into the air.  We watch it fly overhead...

sail high over the crops... it becomes a tiny dot in the sky.

After a long beat of silence it comes back to earth.  It

lands in the street and bounces twenty feet into the air.  It

cleared at least four or five hundred feet of crops.  Maybe

more.

WE LOOK BACK to Merrill standing in the backyard.  He drops

the wooden stick to the grass and moves for his things.  He

piles them in his arms.  When his arms are full, he starts

for the porch.  WE WATCH FROM THE CROPS AS MERRILL GOES

INSIDE THE HOUSE.

INT.  CLOSET - LATE AFTERNOON

Morgan and Bo are seated on the kitchen chair in the closet.

THE FLICKER OF THE TELEVISION FALLS ON THE CHILDREN'S FACES.

WE HEAR MERRILL AND GRAHAM COMING DOWN THE HALLWAY BEFORE WE

SEE THEM.

They appear almost at the same time in the doorway to the

closet.  Graham and Merrill are holding hammers.

All four stare at the television.

ON THE SCREEN IS A STREET FILLED WITH PEOPLE RUNNING WITH

SUITCASES AND BAGS.  SOME PEOPLE ARE GETTING TRAMPLED.

OTHERS ARE STANDING ON THE STREET CORNER AND YELLING.  THERE

IS PANIC IN THE AIR.

THE IMAGE ON THE TELEVISION SCREEN CHANGES TO A NIGHT TIME

VIEW OF THE TEL AVIV CITY LINE.  THERE ARE FOURTEEN LIGHTS IN

TWO "V" FORMATIONS OVER THE CITY.

Beat.

The words silence everyone.  Beat.

The image goes back to a quiet TV anchor.  He takes a second

before starting up again.

The television shows hundreds of Israelis in a temple and in

the streets praying.

Graham watches quietly as the masses pray side by side.

Bo watches as Graham leaves the doorway of the closet.  She

turns back to the television.

Beat.  Merrill leans down between his niece and nephew.

They don't answer.  They watch the soldiers loading up onto

trucks on the television.

Morgan glances at Bo and then back to his uncle.

Beat.  Merrill gazes at the two questioning faces.  He looks

back at the empty closet doorway where Graham stood.  He

turns back to the children.

The children think it over.  Beat.

Beat.

INT.  HALLWAY - LATE AFTERNOON

Merrill smiles as he steps out of the closet and closes the

door half-way.

He stands in the hall by himself.  He takes a couple deep

breaths as everything hits him.

INT.  CLOSET - LATE AFTERNOON

Morgan turns off the television.

He and Bo sit quietly in the closet under the stairs.

INT.  FAMILY ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

Graham sits in a chair by the windows.  He has a board on his

lap.  He has a hammer in his hands.  Graham drowns in his

thoughts as the skies darken behind him.

INT.  UPSTAIRS LANDING - EVENING

Graham, Bo and Morgan are seated in the upstairs hallway.

There's a couple boards left leaning against the walls.

Merrill comes out of the children's room with his tools.

Merrill stands and leans against the wall.

Everyone sits quietly for a moment.

Beat.

Merrill glances at Graham.

Beat.

Graham nods "yes."

Graham turns and looks at Merrill.  They stare at each other

quietly.  They have a conversation without words.  Beat.

INT.  KITCHEN - EVENING

The windows in the kitchen are boarded up, as is the back

door.

The sink is piled with pots and pans.  It seems like every

utensil and dish in the kitchen was used.

INT.  DINNING ROOM - EVENING

One side of the dinning room is lined with windows that have

been boarded up.

The table is set.  Mash potatoes, spaghetti, French toast,

chicken teriyaki and bacon cheeseburgers are all displayed

elegantly on serving dishes.

The Hess family sits around the table.  Beat.  The scene is

somber.  No one is moving.

No one says anything.  No one eats.

Beat.

Bo sits next to her three glasses of water and begins to cry.

Morgan's face is hard, but tears start to fall anyway.

Graham watches as both his children cry at the table.

Graham takes big scoops of every dish and piles it on his

plate.  He digs his fork into the pile and starts to shove it

in his mouth.  He swallows.

Bo, Morgan and Merrill watch in stunned silence as Graham

stuffs more in his mouth.  He chews and chews and swallows

hard.  He digs his fork into the pile again.

Graham starts crying as he eats.  He keeps taking more bites.

More tears fall.

Morgan gets up from his seat.  He goes to Graham's chair.  He

leans against his dad's arm and cries with him.  Graham's

fork stops moving.  He watches as Bo moves from her seat to

his other side.  She holds her dad's arm and cries.

Beat.  Graham pulls them both up onto the chair with him and

hugs them tight.  Merrill leans forward and comes to the pile

on Graham's chair.  Merrill buries his head in Graham's

shoulder.  The Hess family huddles together at one end of the

table.  Beat.

THE BABY MONITOR EXPLODES WITH STATIC AND NOISE.

Everyone slowly turns and looks over to Morgan's place

setting where the baby monitor sits on the table.  THE RED

LIGHTS ON THE FRONT ARE ALL LIT UP.

Merrill sits up.  Graham puts down the children from his lap.

He gets up from his seat and moves around the table and out

of the dinning room.  He moves through the family room and

into the hall.

Graham opens the closet door and looks in at the television.

He turns it ON.

Beat.  THE EMERGENCY BROADCAST SYMBOL IS ON THE SCREEN.  A

LOW TONE EMITS FROM THE TV.  Beat.  Graham changes stations.

THE SYMBOL AND TONE APPEAR ON EVERY CHANNEL.  THE MONOTONE

SOUND FILLS THE CLOSET.  Beat.

Graham steps out into the hall.  Merrill and the two children

are standing there waiting.  Graham looks at them.

INT.  UPSTAIRS HALL - EVENING

Merrill pounds furiously with his hammer as he nails boards

to the children's bedroom door.  The master bedroom door is

open with a board leaning next to it.  Graham is inside his

bedroom

INT.  GRAHAM'S BEDROOM - EVENING

Graham walks to the window next to his bed.  It's the same

one we've looked out twice before.

Graham looks out onto his backyard.  The FLOOD LIGHT FROM THE

HOUSE THROWS LONG SHADOWS OVER THE YARD.  There is a light

breeze.  Nothing seems wrong.

Graham's eyes stay locked on the crops which go on and on

into darkness.  He moves closer to the glass.  Watches the

top of the corn stalks swaying slightly with the wind.

SOMETHING MOVES IN THE DARKNESS.

Graham's eyes moves to where the corn crops fade into black

forty feet away.  Graham goes very still.

LINES EMERGE IN THE CROPS; THE KIND OF LINES MADE BY SOMEONE

TRAMPLING THROUGH A FIELD.  WE CAN'T SEE WHO'S MAKING THEM.

ALL WE SEE ARE THE COUNTLESS LINES BEING FORMED.  THE LINES

MOVE FROM THE DARKNESS TOWARDS THE HOUSE.  GRAHAM WATCHES

THEM CLOSE IN ON HIS BACKYARD.  THIRTY FEET... TWENTY FEET...

TEN...

Graham backs away from the window towards the middle of his

bedroom.

Graham turns to see Merrill standing with the last board in

the hall.  Graham moves out into the hall and shuts the

bedroom door behind him.

INT.  UPSTAIRS HALL - EVENING

Merrill immediately puts the wooden board up and starts

hammering nails into the frame.  Graham picks up his hammer

and quietly begins to hammer nails into the wood.

Graham glances to his right as he works.  Bo and Morgan are

standing together at the top of the stairs.  Bo holds

Morgan's hand.

Graham keeps hammering as he speaks.

Bo nods "no" lightly.

Graham stops hammering.  Merrill keeps going.

Graham smiles to himself as he remembers the moment.  Merrill

finishes hammering.

Graham goes over and picks up Bo.

Bo nods, "no."

Graham looks at his daughter quietly.  He brushes the hair

out of her face as Merrill moves to Morgan and picks him up.

All four turn and look at the three boarded up bedroom doors.

Beat.

INT.  FRONT HALL - EVENING

Graham puts Bo down in the hallway.  She stands close to him.

Merrill puts down Morgan.  The four of them stand quietly in

a tight group.

THEY HEAR FRANTIC BARKING IN THE DISTANCE.

ISABELLE'S BARKING BECOMES DESPERATE AND ANGRY.  THEY LISTEN

AS SHE BARKS NONSTOP FOR TEN SECONDS... AND THEN SUDDENLY

STOPS.

THE LOW EMERGENCY TONE FROM THE CLOSET TV FILLS THE SILENCE.

Beat.

THE FIRST SOUNDS OF MOVEMENT ARE HEARD OUTSIDE.  CREAKS OF

WOOD FROM THE FRONT PORCH CAN BE HEARD.

THERE IS SOUNDS OF MOVEMENT FROM BEHIND THE LOCKED BACK DOOR.

SOUNDS OF MOVEMENT AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE.  SOUNDS

FROM ALL DIRECTIONS.

THERE IS SCRATCHING NOISES AGAINST THE FRONT DOOR.  METAL

NOISES AS THE HANDLE IS TRIED.

THE DOOR CREAKS AS PRESSURE IS PLACED AGAINST IT.

Morgan looks at his father, unable to speak.

THERE ARE THUDS ABOVE THEM.

All four look up.

THEY LISTEN AS THE THUDS INCREASE IN NUMBER.

THE FIRST SOUND OF SHATTERING GLASS IS HEARD FROM UPSTAIRS.

Merrill looks up the stairs at the boarded bedroom doors.

Graham takes Morgan's hand.

Graham smiles down at his son who smiles gently back.

SCRATCHING NOISES BEGIN TO COME FROM UPSTAIRS.

The group of four turns and watches the top of the stairs.

The BEDROOM DOOR HANDLES ARE BEING RATTLED.

Merrill's eyes moves quietly above the bedroom doors, to the

ceiling of the upstairs hallway.  He stares at a rectangle in

the ceiling.  A tiny rope hangs from the rectangle.  Beat.

Merrill sprints up the stairs.

Morgan and Bo watch as Graham follows after Merrill.

INT.  UPSTAIRS HALL - EVENING

Graham and Merrill stare up at the ceiling.  There is

movement right above them.  Dust falls from a ceiling light

right next to them.

The rope hanging from the attic trapdoor hangs between them.

They watch as it begins to twitch and sway.

The springs in the trap door begins to GROAN.  The door

starts to fall open.

Merrill and Graham raise their arms above their head and

reach up.  The door opens a few inches.  Merrill is taller.

The door presses against his fingers first.  It gives a few

more inches before Merrill stops it.

Graham's finger are barely touching it.  Merrill's face turns

red with strain as something pushes down on the door.

Graham brings his arms down.  He sees his children watching

from the bottom of the stairs.  Graham looks around where he

is.  There is a very small table with photos against a wall.

A laundry closet and three boarded up bedroom doors...

nothing else.  Graham turns to Merrill.

Merrill's face is a deep crimson.

Graham looks around again... the same things... the same

table... the same closet... Graham stops and stares at the

closet.  It has a wooden folding door that opens and closed

on a guide rail.  The wooden folding door is very tall.  Its

top is one foot from the ceiling.

Graham goes to the closet and grabs the door.  He starts

rocking it hard.  Pulling it out... It starts to come out of

its guide rail... Graham leans back with all his weight...

The thin wooden door rips out of place.  One end is still

attached at the hinge.  Graham pulls it straight.  It reaches

into the middle of the landing.  It stands right next to

Merrill.  Right under the attic trapdoor.  Its top is only a

few inches lower than Merrill's reach.

Merrill hesitates and then lowers the attic trapdoor.  It

connects with the top of the closet door and stops.  The

trapdoor is now open almost a foot... We can now see part of

the bottom step of the wooden pull out stairs that lead to

the attic.

Merrill and Graham step away as the closet folding door holds

the weight of the attic door.

After a moment, the spring on the attic trapdoor recoils as

the pressure is let up.  The trapdoor closes.  Beat.

It opens with force, slamming the top of the standing closet

door with a THUD.

The attic trapdoor closes again.  Opens again with force.

THUD.

The closet folding door begins to pull away from the hinges

keeping it upright.

Graham moves down the stairs.  Merrill follows him.

INT.  FRONT HALL - EVENING

THE SCRATCHING NOISES FILL THE HOUSE.

Morgan and Bo are frozen watching a set of long fingers reach

under the front door.  THE COLOR OF THE FINGERS CHANGES -- TO

THE EXACT COLOR AND TEXTURE OF THE YELLOW CRACKED PAINT ON

THE DOOR.

THUD.  THE TRAPDOOR SLAMS THE TOP OF THE FOLDING DOOR

UPSTAIRS.

Graham and Merrill arrive in the front hall.  Graham takes

Morgan and Bo by the hand and leads them quickly down the

hall.  Merrill backs away as he watches the top of the

stairs.

ANOTHER THUD ECHOES THROUGH THE HOUSE.

INT.  KITCHEN - EVENING

The swinging door swings open and closed behind Merrill as he

enters the kitchen.

Graham has moved the chairs away from the kitchen table and

waits by it.  Merrill goes over and the two of them push the

table against the swinging door.

They take the kitchen chairs and pile a couple on top, and

jam the rest underneath the table.

Graham leans against the kitchen counter.  Merrill stares at

the pile of furniture.

Graham points to a set of narrow stairs that lead to a

darkened door at the bottom.

Beat.  Graham looks at the faces of his frightened children.

THUD.

Merrill looks at the boarded up back door.  Graham turns to

Bo and Morgan who stand against the wall.

THUD WITH A CRACK OF WOOD FROM UPSTAIRS.  Merrill turns and

stares at the barricaded entrance to the kitchen.

THE LAST THUD COMES WITH A SOUND OF WOOD SPLINTERING.  THE

CLOSET FOLDING DOOR CRASHES TO THE GROUND IN THE UPSTAIRS

HALL.

WE HEAR CREAKS AS THE ATTIC TRAPDOOR OPENS.

Graham moves towards the basement stairs.

Graham gestures for the kids to come to the stairs.  Morgan

and Bo move to their father slowly.

Graham ushers the two children down the stairs.  He waits for

Merrill.  Merrill turns from the kitchen door and walks

toward him.  Merrill stops and looks down the stairs.

Beat.  Merrill's eyes fill with water.  He doesn't look up at

his older brother.

Merrill walks down the stairs.  Graham waits at the top.  He

watches the kitchen door with the table and chairs against

it.  Beat.

THERE IS MOVEMENT OUTSIDE IN THE HALL.

The door starts to force its way open.  THE TABLE AND CHAIRS

BEGIN TO SCRAPE ACROSS THE KITCHEN FLOOR LIKE NAILS AGAINST A

CHALK BOARD.

WE HEAR VOICE-LIKE SOUNDS ENTER THE KITCHEN.  SOUNDS MADE

FROM INHALES, NOT EXHALES.

INT.  BASEMENT - EVENING

Graham comes down the last few steps and enters the basement.

Graham closes the door behind him.  It has no lock.

The basement is lined with metal shelves.  The shelves are

cluttered with all sorts of canned goods, extension cords,

cleaning supplies, decorations, outdoor tools.  Merrill

rummages through the shelves frantically.

Graham puts his ear to the door and listens.

Merrill moves to another set of shelves.  He starts knocking

things to the ground.

There is SCRATCHING AGAINST THE DOOR.  The doorknob turns.

Graham grabs it with both hands.  The door begins to push

open.

Merrill reaches between two stacks of shelves and pulls out a

pick for digging in the ground.  He holds it up in the air.

It has a three-foot wooden handle.

Merrill turns and rushes in Graham's direction.

A single light bulb hangs from a wire in the ceiling.  It is

the only light in the room.  Merrill CLIPS THE LIGHT BULB

with the end of the wooden handle as he crosses the room.

THE BULB SHATTERS.

THE BASEMENT IS INSTANTLY BLACK.

WE HEAR THE SOUNDS OF SUDDEN COMMOTION, VOICES.  STRUGGLING

AT THE DOOR.  STEPS ON BROKEN GLASS.

CLICK.  A BEAM OF A FLASHLIGHT COMES ON.

IT ILLUMINATES MORGAN STANDING NEXT TO A RACK OF METAL

SHELVES.  HE TURNS THE FLASHLIGHT IN HIS TINY HANDS.

THE NARROW BEAM MOVES ACROSS THE DARKNESS.  IT FINDS MERRILL

AND GRAHAM LEANING UP AGAINST THE BASEMENT DOOR.

MORGAN MOVES THE BEAM DOWN TO THE PICK, WHICH IS WEDGED

BETWEEN THE DOORKNOB AND THE GROUND.  THE PICK WAVERS A

LITTLE WITH EACH PUSH FROM THE OTHER SIDE, BUT HOLDS.

THE SCRATCHING AND MOVEMENT OUTSIDE THE DOOR BEGINS TO

LESSEN.

Beat.  Morgan slowly moves THE BEAM BACK UP TO HIS FATHER'S

FACE.

THE BEAM SEARCHES IN THE DARKNESS.  THROUGH THE BOXES,

BETWEEN THE SHELVES... IT SETTLES ON A SMALL FOOT HIDING

BEHIND A COUPLE TWENTY-FIVE POUND BAGS OF DOG FOOD.  BO'S

HEAD SLOWLY APPEARS.  SHE SQUINTS AS SHE LOOKS IN THE LIGHT.

ANOTHER BEAM COMES ON.  IT REVEALS MERRILL AT THE SHELVES

WITH A SECOND FLASHLIGHT.  HE LOOKS OVER THE CONTENTS OF THE

SHELVES NEAR HIM.  BEAT.

HIS BEAM OF LIGHT FALLS ON A RADIO.

He turns the knob to "on."  The radio lights up, but no sound

emerges for it's speakers.  Merrill turns the channel knob

and checks all the stations.  No sound.  No signal.  He

listens to the LIGHT HUM FROM THE SPEAKERS.

Beat.

Beat.

THEY ALL LISTEN TO THE DEAD AIR HUM FROM THE RADIO SPEAKERS.

THERE IS A LOUD BANG.

BOTH FLASHLIGHT BEAMS CRISSCROSS OVER THE BASEMENT AND COME

TO A STOP ON THE DOOR.

ANOTHER BANG.  THE DOOR VIBRATES.  THE PICK WITH THE WOODEN

HANDLE HOLDS IN PLACE.

BANG.

GRAHAM STEPS INTO THE BEAM OF LIGHTS.  He looks at the door

and then turns and faces the lights.

Graham looks at Merrill's corner of the darkness.  Morgan

moves his BEAM ONTO MERRILL.

BANG.  A beat of silence.

BANG.

Morgan puts the FLASHLIGHT ON THE GROUND AND ROLLS IT ACROSS

THE FLOOR.  THE BEAM SPINS IN TINY CIRCLES SHOWING THE BROKEN

GLASS OF THE BULB IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR.

THE FLASHLIGHT COMES TO A STOP IN GRAHAM'S PALM.  He picks it

up.

Merrill moves next to Graham.  ANOTHER BANG FROM THE DOOR.

They aim their FLASHLIGHTS IN ONE CORNER OF THE ROOM.  The

brothers move in opposite directions.

GRAHAM MOVES HIS BEAM UP AND DOWN CHECKING THE WALLS AND THE

CEILING AS HE MOVES.

MERRILL MOVES BETWEEN SHELVES, ONE AT A TIME.  HIS FLASHLIGHT

PEERS BEHIND THE STACKS OF CANNED GOODS.

A BANG ECHOES THROUGH THE BASEMENT DOOR.

Merrill and Graham are at opposite ends of the room now.

THE TWO BEAMS OF LIGHT START MOVING TOWARDS EACH OTHER.

BANG.

THE BEAMS MOVE UP AND DOWN OVER THE FINAL WALL.  GRAHAM AND

MERRILL MOVE CLOSER AND CLOSER... THE TWO BEAMS FINALLY COME

TO A STOP IN THE SAME PLACE... THEY SHINE DOWN ON MORGAN.

HE SITS ON THE GROUND AGAINST THE WALL.  HE STARES UP AT THE

TWO LIGHTS.

IN THE BEAM OF LIGHTS YOU CAN SEE HIS HAIR MOVING GENTLY FROM

A BREEZE.

GRAHAM AND MERRILL TURN THEIR LIGHTS STRAIGHT INTO THE AIR

VENT HE'S LEANING AGAINST.

EYES ARE REVEALED IN THE DARKNESS OF THE VENT.  A NARROW SET

OF METALLIC COLORED FINGERS SHOOT OUT BETWEEN THE HOLES IN

THE VENT GRILL AND GRAB MORGAN.

MORGAN SCREAMS.  THE FLASHLIGHTS DROP TO THE GROUND.  THERE'S

A DESPERATE SCRAMBLE.  FEET MOVE THROUGH THE BEAMS OF LIGHT.

WE CAN'T SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING.

SOMEONE PICKS UP A FLASHLIGHT.  WE SEE GLIMPSES OF STRAINING

FACES.  MORGAN SCREAMING.

THE FLASHLIGHT IS DROPPED AND PICKED UP AGAIN.  WE SEE IT IS

BO WHO IS HOLDING THE LIGHT.

BO TURNS THE LIGHT AT THE VENT.  MERRILL IS THE ONLY ONE

THERE.  HE PRESSES ONE OF THE TWENTY-FIVE POUND BAGS OF DOG

FOOD AGAINST THE METAL GRILL.  HE DRAGS THE SECOND BAG OVER

WITH HIS FOOT AND SLAMS IT AGAINST THE FIRST BAG.  HE QUICKLY

MOVES OUT OF THE LIGHT.

BO FOLLOWS HIM WITH THE BEAM.  SHE FINDS HIM DRAGGING AN

ENORMOUS BAG OF FLOUR OVER TO THE VENT.  HE HEAVES IT ON TOP

OF THE PILE.  HE LEAVES THE LIGHT AGAIN.  RETURNS WITH

ANOTHER GIANT BAG OF FLOUR.  GRUNTS AS HE THROWS IT ON TOP OF

THE REST.

MERRILL FALLS TO THE GROUND EXHAUSTED.  THE PILE OF DOG FOOD

AND FLOUR COMPLETELY OBSCURE THE VENT.  A CAN OF SOUP ROLLS

ON THE GROUND NEAR MERRILL.  HE SLOWLY PICKS IT UP AND PUTS

AN ADDITIONAL EIGHT OUNCES ON THE PILE.

Merrill slowly catches his breath.  He reaches over to his

side and grabs the remaining flashlight.  HE TRAINS THE BEAM

AROUND THE ROOM TILL HE FINDS MORGAN.

HE FINDS THE BOY IN GRAHAM'S LAP.  MORGAN IS SEATED WITH HIS

BACK AGAINST GRAHAM'S CHEST.  USING HIM AS A CHAIR.  MORGAN'S

FACE IS PALE.  HE IS TAKING VERY LONG SLOW HEAVES.  IT SOUNDS

LIKE THE AIR IS GOING THROUGH A STRAW.  HE'S SUFFOCATING.

GRAHAM LOOKS UP INTO THE LIGHT.

Merrill looks at his nephew turning gray.

Graham pulls Morgan closer to his body and talks into the

child's ear.

Morgan's throat is closing -- his face is filled with strain

and panic.

Bo moves to Merrill and curls up with him as they watch.

Graham closes his eyes.  Beat.  He opens his eyes and talks

into Morgan's ear.

Graham closes his eyes -- talks to the darkness.

Merrill stares at his brother's desperate face.

Graham's eyes open as Morgan's tiny fingers press down on

Graham's hand.  The fingers squeeze with all the strength

they have.

Graham looks to Merrill helplessly.  Merrill's eyes fill up

with water.

Graham's eyes close.

Graham's eyes open as he leans in close to Morgan's ear.

A THIN STREAM OF SOUND EMITS FROM MORGAN'S THROAT.  LIKE THE

SOUND OF AIR LEAKING FROM A BALLOON.

Morgan's fingers relax a little on Graham's hand.

THE LEAKING BALLOON SOUND TURNS BACK INTO THE SOUND OF AIR

THROUGH A STRAW.

Merrill watches as Graham's face stays pressed up against his

son.

Merrill watches as Morgan's chest starts to move in sync with

Graham's.

THE SOUND OF THE STRAW FADES AS MORGAN'S BREATHING TURNS INTO

LABORED BREATHS.

Graham's eyes close.  He starts crying.  He speaks to no one.

Morgan's fingers relax on Graham's hand.  Merrill watches as

father and son breathe together.  Merrill and Bo hold each

other tight.

THE FLASHLIGHT FLICKERS ON GRAHAM AND MORGAN'S EXHAUSTED

FACES.  THEY BOTH STARE OUT INTO THE DARKNESS OF THE

BASEMENT.  TEARS DRYING ON THEIR CHEEKS.  THEY'RE BOTH LOST

IN THEIR THOUGHTS.

Beat.

Beat.  Graham nods without looking over.

MERRILL PRESSES THE BUTTON ON HIS FLASHLIGHT.  THE BEAM OF

LIGHT ILLUMINATING GRAHAM AND MORGAN GOES OUT.  THEY

DISAPPEAR INTO SHADOWS.

Merrill looks down to Bo, who has the second flashlight in

her hand.  THE BEAM POINTS UP AT THE BASEMENT CEILING ABOVE

HER AND MERRILL.

Merrill nods to her.  She reaches down and presses the

button.

THE BASEMENT IS ENGULFED BY BLACK.

INT.  BASEMENT - MORNING

WE ARE STILL IN BLACK.  A VOICE IS HEARD IN THE DARKNESS.

IT'S MURKY AT FIRST, THEN BECOMES CLEARER.

Graham opens his eyes from sleep.  HE SQUINTS FROM THE LIGHT

OF THE HANGING BULB IN THE BASEMENT.

Merrill steps into his vision.

Merrill walks back to the radio on the metal shelf.  THE

VOICE WE HEARD IN THE DARKNESS COMES FROM THE TINY SPEAKER OF

THE RADIO.

Merrill waits for his brother to say something.  Beat.

Beat.

Beat.

Beat.

Merrill's face is hard.  He looks shaken.  Graham stares at

the conviction in his younger brother's expression.

Beat.

THERE'S A WHEEZING SOUND FROM THE CORNER OF THE ROOM.  Graham

and Merrill turn to look at Morgan -- laying down on

Merrill's folded sweater.  Morgan's breathing is strained.

He still looks grey.

Graham looks at Morgan lying limp on the ground.  Graham

turns to Merrill.

The two men stand under the single dangling light bulb.

Graham quietly turns and looks at Morgan.  He moves across

the room towards him.

Merrill watches as Graham kneels down and reaches to Morgan's

side.  Graham unclips the baby monitor from his son's belt.

Graham walks back to Merrill.  He holds it out between them.

Beat.

He turns it ON.

A SLIGHT STATIC IS HEARD.  GRAHAM TURNS THE VOLUME ALL THE

WAY UP.  THE STATIC GETS A LITTLE LOUDER, BUT DOESN'T CHANGE.

THERE ARE NO NOISES, NO SPIKES, NO VOICES... JUST EMPTY

ELECTRICAL STATIC.  Beat.

Graham makes eye contact with Merrill.  Beat.

INT.  BASEMENT STAIRWELL - MORNING

DAYLIGHT FILTERS DOWN FROM THE KITCHEN AND PIERCES THE

STAIRWELL TO THE BASEMENT.

The basement door cracks open a few inches.  Beat.  Merrill

opens it all the way.

DUST FLOATS UP IN THE DAYLIGHT THAT SPILLS DOWN THE STAIRS.

Merrill moves up the stairs by himself.  He reaches the top

and looks around.  Turns back down to the faces at the

bottom.  Gives them the thumbs up.

Graham leads Bo up the stairs.  He carries a limp Morgan in

his arms.

INT.  KITCHEN - MORNING

THE KITCHEN IS KIND OF BEAUTIFUL IN ITS DESTRUCTION.  BEAMS

OF DAYLIGHT CRISSCROSS THE ROOM FROM THE PUNCHED OUT HOLES IN

THE WINDOWS AND BOARDS.

THE BACK DOOR IS WIDE OPEN.

WE HEAR SOUNDS FROM THE TV FILTERING IN FROM THE HALL.

Graham and Bo and Morgan watch as Merrill walks over the

toppled chairs to get to the cabinets.

Merrill nods as he begins to search the piles of things that

have fallen from the cabinets.

INT.  FAMILY ROOM - MORNING

SHAFTS OF SUNLIGHT STREAM IN FROM ONE SIDE OF THE FAMILY ROOM

WHERE THE WINDOWS HAVE BEEN BROKEN IN.

Graham gently lays Morgan on the sofa.

WE HEAR CHEERING COME FROM THE TELEVISION, FILTER THROUGH THE

FRONT HALL AND INTO THE FAMILY ROOM.

Bo steps out of the closet and looks into the family room.

She points at the closet.

Morgan strains to look in her direction.  Graham looks at

him.

Morgan nods, "yes" as he struggles to breathe.

INT.  CLOSET - MORNING

THE TELEVISION SHOWS A SHOT OF A STREET CORNER.  THOUSANDS OF

PEOPLE STAND IN THE STREETS.  A REPORTER STANDS AMONGST THEM

AND TALKS INTO A MICROPHONE.

Graham unplugs the television.  The screen goes black.

Bo moves the coats aside as Graham wheels the television and

the television cart out into the hall.

INT.  FAMILY ROOM - MORNING

Graham pulls the television into the family room.  Careful

not to trip it on the carpet.

THE GLASS OF THE TELEVISION IS LIKE A MIRROR.

Graham moves the television into position.  THE BLACK SCREEN

REFLECTS THE FAMILY ROOM BEHIND GRAHAM AS IT TURNS.

THE REFLECTION OF A CREATURE SILHOUETTED PANS ACROSS THE

TELEVISION SCREEN.

The TV stops moving.  Graham stays frozen with his hands on

either side of the television cart.  He's slightly bent over.

His back is to the family room.

Graham straightens and turns around slowly.

Morgan is held by his waist three feet in the air.  Morgan's

face turns to the color of ash as his throat closes up.

For a moment it appears he's suspended in the air.  Then we

see the outlines... and we see the eyes.  The black eyes.

There is a creature close to seven feet tall standing in the

middle of the family room.  It's powdery skin has taken on

the shades, lines and colors of the family room so perfectly,

it almost disappears.

It blinks.

Graham and Bo have turned to stone.  Bo stands frozen in the

front hall.

Merrill comes out of the doorway from the kitchen to the

family room.  He takes two steps into the room and comes to a

stop next to the fireplace.  The inhaler and syringe in his

hand fall to the ground.  The creature is between Graham and

Merrill in the middle of the family room.

Morgan is dying.  THE LAST SOUNDS OF AIR STOP IN HIS THROAT.

The lines of the chairs and windowsill mimicked on the

creature's skin move as the creature moves its free hand.

Graham's eyes shift to the hand.  THREE OF THE CREATURES

FINGERS ARE MISSING -- SLICED OFF BY A BUTCHER KNIFE.

The creature's hand moves to Morgan's face.  It tilts its

fingers and palm back.  THE COLORS ON THE HAND ARE ALREADY

CHANGING TO MATCH IT'S NEW POSITION IN THE ROOM.

A small pore opens up on its wrist.  A YELLOWISH GAS STARTS

TO LEAK OUT OF THE OPENING.

Graham looks up from the leaking poison gas to the face of

the creature.  It's large empty black eyes lock on Graham's.

GRAHAM STARTS TO HEAR A HIGH PITCH RINGING SOUND -- IT BEGINS

TO ENGULF ALL SOUND IN THE ROOM.

GRAHAM STARES HELPLESSLY INTO THE LARGE BLACK EYES.

WE MOVE INTO GRAHAM'S EYES... THEY WIDEN.  WE SEE THE EMOTION

IN THEM.  HIS MOUTH BARELY GETS THE WORDS OUT.

THE HIGH PITCHED RINGING SOUND OVERWHELMS EVERYTHING.  THE

ROOM GOES BRIGHT WHITE.

EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

WE ARE BLINDED BY A BRIGHT LIGHT.  THE LIGHT IS MOVING.  WE

REALIZE IT IS THE HEADLIGHTS OF A CAR THAT PULLS TO THE SIDE

OF THE ROAD.

The car door opens.  Graham Hess steps out.  His coat is

open.  He is wearing a black shirt and black pants.  A

priest's white collar sits under the lapel of the black

shirt.  Graham looks around in a daze.

We are on a country road.  THERE ARE STROBING RED AND WHITE

LIGHTS FILLING THE NIGHT AIR.  Four police cars are scattered

amongst the tow trucks and the ambulances.

A large group of officers and workers hover around a green

truck that has swerved off the road into a grouping of trees.

Officer Edgar Paski walks up to Graham.  He whispers

something into a walkie clipped to his shirt as he

approaches.  Edgar looks badly shaken.  Beat.  The two men

look at each other.

Graham stands motionless with his hands at his sides.  Beat.

Officer Paski gestures in the direction of one of the

ambulances.  Ray Reddy sits to the side on the grass.  His

arms rest on his bent knees.

Graham smiles a little smile.

Beat.

Beat.

Beat.

Beat.

Beat.

EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

The other officers turn and look as Graham walks by them.  He

walks on, unaware of the stares.

He slows as he reaches the back bumper of the truck.  It

sticks out onto the road a few feet.  He comes around the

side of the vehicle.

COLLEEN HESS is beautiful in a delicate way.  Her straight

brown hair falls down over her small face.  She leans over

the front bumper of the truck onto the hood.  Her head rests

on her arms like a child resting on a school desk.  Her back

is against a tree.  The lower half of her is obscured by the

truck.

She's able to raise her head and shoulders as Graham walks up

to her.  She is shivering slightly.

Graham glances down.  There are bundles of blood soaked

blankets in the area below her.  They peek out under the

twisted front of the truck.  Graham looks up quickly.

Beat.

Beat.

Graham touches her cheek.  She starts crying.  Graham starts

crying with her.

Colleen presses her cheek on top of Graham's hand.  She rests

on it.  Her eyes are distant.

WE ARE OVERCOME BY A BRIGHT WHITE.

INT.  FAMILY ROOM - MORNING

WE ARE IN THE FAMILY ROOM.  THE HIGH PITCHED RINGING SOUNDS

FADE AND ARE REPLACED BY THE BREATHING IN THE ROOM.

THE BREATHING IS JOINED BY THE HISSING OF GAS AS IT'S BEING

RELEASED.

THE CREATURE FORCES POISON GAS OUT INTO MORGAN'S UNCONSCIOUS

FACE.

THE ROOM IS ENGULFED WITH STREAMS OF SUNLIGHT FROM THE BROKEN

WINDOWS.  THE LIGHT SEEMS TO CATCH CERTAIN THINGS IN THE ROOM

AND MAKE THEM STAND OUT.  THINGS ON SHELVES, THINGS ON

TABLES, THINGS ON THE WALL.

Graham stares at the baseball bat on the wall.  Beat.

Morgan's face is obscured by gas.

Merrill turns and looks to Graham.

Graham's eyes are not on Merrill.  Merrill follows his eye

line to the baseball bat mounted above him.

Beat.  Merrill reaches up and takes the bat off its resting

place.

The creature starts to move.

Merrill's hands tighten around the handle as he walks

forward.  He stops.  His weight shifts to his right leg.

The creature begins to turn and becomes more visible as its

lines and colors don't match in position in the room.

Merrill's left leg goes out.  His torso and shoulders turn

with staggering speed and strength.  The bat slices through

the air of the family room... Contact.

The creature gets HAMMERED across the back with the baseball

bat.

Morgan is dropped.  He falls to the carpet of the family room

in an unnatural crumpled pile.  His arms and legs flop

lifelessly to the carpet.

The creature turns to face Merrill.  All the creature sees is

the BLUR OF WOOD as Merrill swings like a lumberjack.  SLAM.

The creature falls to the ground.

Graham takes Bo by the hand and moves to Morgan.  Graham

picks up his son's limp body in his arms.

The creature moves to its feet.

Merrill's hands choke up on the bat.  Merrill's eyes are on

fire.

Graham leans down and picks up the full syringe of medicine

on the ground.

Merrill SCREAMS as he swings again.  His powerful muscles

pull his shoulders whipping around.  The bat connects with

the creature across its chest.  The creature is thrown back

into the wall.  Two glass of water fall off a shelf and CRASH

ONTO THE CREATURE'S SHOULDER.  The water connects with it's

skin.  The creature makes a HIGH PITCHED INHALE SOUND.

Bo and Graham look up.

THE CREATURE'S SHOULDER STOPS CHANGING COLORS AND WITHERS

INTO A POWDERY WHITE.

Merrill looks back across the room at Bo and Graham.  They

stare at each other with sudden realization.

Merrill looks around at Bo's half-filled water glasses places

all over the family room.

INT.  KITCHEN - MORNING

Graham carries Morgan through the kitchen and out the back

door.  Morgan's arms and legs swing limp as Graham walks.

Morgan's head bobs back from its own weight as Graham steps

outside.

INT.  FAMILY ROOM - MORNING

Merrill steps in.  THE WOODEN BAT MAKES A SOUND AS IT CUTS

THROUGH THE AIR.  SLAM!  It connects with the creature.  The

creature falls back into the coffee table.  Bo's glasses of

water crack and SPLASH OVER the creature's TORSO.  ANOTHER

HIGH PITCHED INHALE SCREAM.  His torso turns a powdery white.

Parts of its body are still changing and matching its

environment.  Parts are white.

The creature stands again.

Merrill looks for the next target in the room.  Bo points to

the dinning table where the old chicken teriyaki, bacon

cheeseburger and spaghetti with meatballs sit untouched.

Merrill sees the three glasses of water at Bo's seat.  He

nods.

INT.  FAMILY ROOM - MORNING

MERRILL YELLS WITH EVERYTHING IN HIS LUNGS.  His wrists turn.

His shoulders torque.  THE WOODEN LOUISVILLE SLUGGER SLICES

THE AIR AND SHATTERS WHEN IT CONNECTS WITH THE UPPER CHEST OF

THE CREATURE.  PIECES OF WOOD SPLINTER OVER THE FAMILY ROOM.

THE CREATURE WAVERS AND THEN ALL SEVEN FEET OF IT TIPS OVER.

IT FALLS BACK.  IT CLIPS THE TV STAND AS IT FALLS.  IT LANDS

ON THE GROUND WITH A THUD.

THE CREATURE'S BLACK, EMPTY EYES LOOK UP IN TIME TO SEE BO'S

GLASSES OF WATER RESTING ON THE TELEVISION, FALL... AND SPILL

OVER THE EDGE -- RIGHT ONTO ITS FACE.

THE CREATURE'S SCREAMS FILL THE FAMILY ROOM -- AND THEN

SUDDENLY STOP.

IT BECOMES VERY STILL.  EVERY INCH OF ITS BODY TURNS A

WITHERED, POWDERY WHITE.  BEAT.

Bo watches quietly from the door.  Merrill drops the handle

of the bat in his hands.

EXT.  BACKYARD - MORNING

Merrill and Bo find Graham kneeling in the grass.  Morgan

lays limp in his arms.  They kneel down in the grass with

him.

Merrill sees the empty syringe in Graham's hand.  He looks to

Morgan.  The boy's head is tilted back.  His tiny mouth hangs

open unnaturally.

Merrill stares at Morgan.  His body is utterly still.

Merrill reaches for Morgan's still hand.

Beat.  Morgan lies lifeless.

Bo is crying.

Beat.

HIS SON'S VOICE MAKES HIM STOP.  Graham starts crying.  Every

bit of sadness trapped in his body is released.  He looks

down through tears and tears at Morgan.

INT.  WINDOW - MORNING

We look out through the broken glass of the second story

bedroom window.  We see the worn jungle gym.  We see the

single tree throwing shade on the picnic table.  We see the

golden brown corn lining the back of the yard.

And we see the Hess family.  Sitting together on the grass.

Huddled together in the sunlight.
