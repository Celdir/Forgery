INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. BEDROOM - DAY

We hear a MAN GASPING softly.     Rhythmically.

A LUMINOUS PALE SHAPE slowly forms out of the searing

whiteness. Gradually we realize we're moving across the

ALABASTER BODY of a WOMAN. Her skin translucent.

ON THE WOMAN'S FACE

Ethereal.   Her eyes closed.     Her face lifeless.   Then...

...her eyes open. She looks straight at us with unseeing

pale blue eyes. This is ANNA (late 20s).

We pull back. PAUL (30s) makes love to Anna. Their

movements perfunctory. Passionless. He turns to look at

her. Realizes she's not there. He suddenly stops.

Rolls off her. Sits on the edge of the bed.

Anna leans down and picks up her RED SLIP from the floor.

He shakes his head.    Frustrated.   Lights a cigarette.

Paul immediately realizes he's gone too far.      Turns to Anna.

Anna gets out of bed. Walks towards the bathroom.       Paul

puts his head in his hands.

INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Through the fogged shower partition we see the blurred

ghostly figure of Anna. Paul walks in.

Anna doesn't reply.

her head bowed as she lets the water wash over her.

Anna doesn't move.    We sense the emptiness inside her.

She closes her eyes.    Forces herself to reply.

A DROP OF BLOOD

falls into the water.   Then another drop.

her nose is bleeding. She touches her lips. Looks

impassively at the blood on her fingertips. The SOUND OF

WATER carries into the next scene...

A STREAM OF CRYSTAL BLUE WATER

A MAN'S HANDS penetrate the water. Thin and elegant.

Perfectly manicured. Turning slowly as he washes them

meticulously. He picks up a crisply folded white towel.

Dries his hands carefully. Snaps on white latex gloves.

EXT. CEMETERY - MORNING

A beautiful morning. We move through a tranquil cemetery.

Pastoral and idyllic. Dappled light falls through old

trees onto statues of grieving angels.

EXT. FUNERAL HOME - CONTINUOUS

A path leads to an old well-kept house. Amongst a blaze of

violet tulips we see a sign: Eliot Deane. Funeral Home.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. CASKET DISPLAY ROOM - MORNING

Sun streams into an elegant wood-panelled room. The

Funeral Director, ELIOT DEANE (40s) guides MRS. AYRES

(70s) past caskets tastefully arranged on faux-marble

pedestals. He's a serene man. Quiet and professional.

He gestures to a metal casket.

Mrs. Ayres caresses the soft velvet trimming.

Mrs. Ayres is miles away.

Eliot chooses his words carefully.

INT/EXT. ANNA'S CAR - MORNING

Anna drives past the strip malls of a small suburban town

in a GREEN TOYOTA. On the dashboard a KITSCHY BOBBLEHEAD

DOLL nods its head from side to side. Anna pulls up to a

red light. Glances across at the other cars. We see the

vacant faces of COMMUTERS staring blankly into space.

The light changes. Anna hasn't noticed. The car behind

her HONKS in frustration. She quickly pulls out...

... just as a SUV turns in front of her. She slams on

her brakes. Hard. Missing the SUV by inches. The

DRIVER screams at her. His face contorted in ugly rage.

EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. PARKING LOT - MORNING

Anna locks her car.   Heads towards the main building.

INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. CORRIDOR - MORNING

Classes have started. JACK (11), a serious looking boy,

walks through a silent corridor. Up ahead two OLDER

BOYS, a TALL KID and a KID with ACNE, push a GEEKY BOY

against a locker. Jack tries to pass by unnoticed.

Jack walks faster. The two Older Boys set off after him.

He darts into a corridor. Ducks into an empty classroom.

INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. BIOLOGY CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Jack waits anxiously by the door. It looks like he's

lost the bullies. Then a sudden rustling noise makes him

jump. He turns. TINY CHICKS huddle in a plastic

incubator on a table. Jack moves over to them.

Jack swivels round. The Tall Kid walks towards him as

the Acne Kid guards the door. Jack doesn't reply.

Jack ignores them.   Irritating the Tall Kid even more.

He pushes Jack against the table, toppling the incubator.

Panicked, the CHICKS scatter across the surface. Just

then the door opens. Anna walks in.

She glances at the Older Boys then at Jack.

The Older Boys stare at Jack.    Waiting for his reaction.

Anna looks at Jack carefully.    She knows he's lying.

Jack doesn't hear her. He's mesmerized by a SOLITARY

CHICK standing motionless in the corner of the incubator.

Anna reaches in.   Tenderly picks up the chick.

INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. TEACHERS' COMMON ROOM - DAY

School's over. Anna listlessly corrects a stack of

exercise books. She can't focus. Pulls out a BOTTLE OF

PILLS. Shakes a pill into her hand. Swallows it dry.

INT. LAW OFFICE. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

Paul works with half a dozen COLLEAGUES around a large

conference table covered with documents and thick files.

He reaches across to a pizza box. It's empty.

A PREPPY GUY slides across another pizza box.

NEAL, a thin pallid guy, looks up.

Paul glances at his watch. Suddenly realizes the time.

He quickly picks up his cell phone. Heads for the door.

Everyone laughs.

INT. LAW OFFICE. CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

Paul walks into the corridor dialling his cell phone.

INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. TEACHERS' COMMON ROOM - SAME TIME

Anna's cell phone rings as she closes her locker. She

fishes it out from her bag as she heads to the door.

Checks the ID. Hesitates. Then takes the call.

INT. LAW OFFICE. CORRIDOR - SAME TIME

Paul cups his cell.    Worried he'll be overheard.

INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. CORRIDOR - SAME TIME

Anna steps into an empty corridor.

INT. LAW OFFICE. CORRIDOR - SAME TIME

Paul's anxious.    We sense he's hiding something.

Paul tries hard to cover his nervousness.   Forces a smile.

INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. CORRIDOR - SAME TIME

Despite Paul's reassurances Anna is clearly worried now.

INT. LAW OFFICE. CORRIDOR - SAME TIME

Paul hesitates.    Lowers his voice.

INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

Anna slips her phone back into her bag as she walks

through the deserted corridor. Her high heels echo

loudly in the eerie quietness.

Suddenly one of the fluorescent ceiling lights behind her

blows out with a loud WHUMPH. Anna starts. Turns.

WHUMPH. The next light dies. Anna quickens her step.

The lights go off one by one. The darkness quickly

creeping up behind her. There's only one light still on

as she reaches the exit. She looks up. The light

flickers. But then strangely stays on. Bathing her in a

cold pool of light.

Anna's unsettled. She turns and frantically pushes the

door. It doesn't open. She pushes hard with both hands.

Nothing. It's locked. She turns back slowly. The

darkness around her impenetrable. Almost viscous. She

reaches out...

... her hand DISAPPEARS into the thick blackness.     Anna

snatches her hand back. Stares at it.

Then we hear the sound of SLOW FOOTSTEPS.    Moving

deliberately towards her.

Her voice echoes down the silent corridor.   She glimpses

something move in the blackness.

A BLACK SHAPE materializes inside the darkness. Silent.

Brooding. Anna can't move. Terrified. Suddenly the

corridor's flooded with a BLINDING WHITE LIGHT.

Anna's dazzled. Shades her eyes with her hand.     As she

tentatively pulls her hand away...

...it's only Jack.   His hand on the light switch.

Jack moves over to the door.

He gently pushes against the door.    The door slowly opens.

EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - MOMENTS LATER

Anna, still shaken, walks with Jack towards the parking lot.

She knows he's lying again.     Smiles sadly.

They reach Anna's car.    Stand in silence for a moment.

Jack hesitates.    Then slowly nods his head.

He nods.   Anna's clearly worried about him.

Jack shakes his head.    Anna glances at her watch.

Jack nods disappointed.   Anna watches him walk away then

gets in her car.

INT. ANNA'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

Anna slips her key into the ignition. Loud music suddenly

blares from the car radio. She switches it off. Squeezes

the bridge of her nose. She pulls out a bottle of pills

from her bag. It's empty. She rummages in the glove

compartment. Finds another bottle. Empty. She sighs.

EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - MOMENTS LATER

Jack sits on the bench. Watches Anna drive away. Then

unzips his backpack. Something moves inside. A strange

jerky movement. Jack closes the backpack. Glances up

and down the empty street. Then walks away on his own.

EXT. STRIP MALL. PHARMACY - DAY

Anna steps out of the Pharmacy. As she washes down a pill

with a bottle of water she notices a small Hair Salon.

Looks critically at herself in the Pharmacy window.

Anna moves over to the Salon. Reaches for the door

handle... then hesitates. She's about to walk away when

the Salon door suddenly opens. Anna smiles shyly as a

freshly COIFFURED WOMAN politely holds the door for her.

INT. HAIR SALON - DAY

Anna leans back against a washbasin.    Her neck tightly

cradled against the white porcelain.    The light's harsh

and not particularly flattering. She    closes her eyes.

Behind her the HANDS of a HAIRDRESSER   in latex gloves

begin to rinse dye from Anna's hair.

Startling white. A stream of water flows into the sink.

Then after a moment the spiralling clear water gradually

turns a deep crimson red.

INT. MOTHER'S HOUSE. HALLWAY - DAY

Anna closes the front door behind her. She smiles as

she catches her reflection in the hallway mirror. Her

hair a dark vibrant red. Just then, from another room,

we hear an OLD WOMAN'S hacking cough.

INT. MOTHER'S HOUSE. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Anna's mother, BEATRICE (50s), sits in bed, knitting with

swift, violent precision. The bedside table's stacked

with medication. She's clearly been bed-ridden for some

time. An electric wheelchair in the corner of the room.

Anna appears at the door. Beatrice scrutinizes her for a

second. Then returns to her knitting.

Anna moves to the beside table.   Picks up a dirty plate.

Anna sighs. Trying hard not to let her Mother provoke

her. Beatrice glances up. Anna avoids her look.

Anna goes to the window.   Draws back the curtains.

Anna bites her tongue.    Heads to the door.

Anna goes to the cupboard.    Takes out clean sheets.

Anna dumps the sheets on the bed. As she turns to leave

Beatrice's hand darts out and grabs Anna's wrist.

Anna pulls herself free.   Moves to the door.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. VIEWING ROOM - DAY

A warm intimate room. Peaceful. Rows of chairs filled

with ELDERLY MOURNERS. Eliot stands respectfully beside

a casket. FATHER GRAHAM (50s) reads at a lectern.

EXT. FUNERAL HOME. DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS

Anna, in a black dress, walks quickly along the gravel

driveway. She stops. Stares out over the cemetery.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. VIEWING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Anna slips into the back of the room. Eliot leads MRS.

HUTTON (60s) to the body of her husband, JAMES HUTTON

(70S), lying in the casket. Mrs. Hutton touches a

bouquet of white roses by the casket.

Anna approaches Mrs. Hutton.   She doesn't notice Eliot

watching her carefully.

Anna smiles awkwardly.     Uncomfortable.

But we can see in her eyes that everything's not fine.

Mrs. Hutton nods, then turns to greet another MOURNER.

Anna steps nervously up to the coffin.

James Hutton lies peacefully amongst the velvet trimming.

Suddenly his LIPS PART... as he GASPS SOFTLY.

Anna steps back terrified. Stares at Hutton. His face

serene again. It must have been her imagination. She

glances up quickly. Embarrassed.

Eliot's still observing her.     He nods to her cordially.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. ELIOT'S ROOM - DAY

A spartan room at the top of the house. Eliot carefully

pins a POLAROID of Hutton lying in a coffin to the wall.

Next to Hutton's photograph, we briefly glimpse the edge

of ANOTHER POLAROID.

Eliot stares intently at Hutton's image for a moment,

then takes off his jacket and moves to the window.

Anna's by her car rummaging in a bag for her keys.

Getting increasingly frustrated.

EXT. FUNERAL HOME. DRIVEWAY - DAY

Anna suddenly looses it. Angrily dumps the contents of

her bag onto the driveway. She kneels down. Grabs the

keys. Throws the rest of her things back into the bag.

She stands. Leans against the car. She looks weary.

She glances up at the sky desperately trying to hold back

her tears. Black storm clouds gather on the horizon.

Anna brusquely wipes away her eyes with the back of her

hand. Pulls herself together. Angry with herself.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. ELIOT'S ROOM - DAY

Eliot watches intently as Anna drives away.

INT. RESTAURANT - EVENING

Paul sits at a window table. It's raining hard outside.

He glances at his watch then nervously checks his

pockets. Pulls out a RING BOX. He looks at it for a

moment then slips it back into his pocket.

As he refills his glass, Anna appears outside holding her

raincoat above her head. She stares at Paul for a moment

through the window marbled with rain.

Paul suddenly notices Anna at the window.   He starts.

Spills some of his red wine on his shirt.

CLOSE on the red stain. It unfurls like a flower.

Spreading out over the white material.

Paul dabs the stain with a napkin.

Anna laughs as she sits down.   Paul looks up at her.

A WAITER appears at the table before Anna can reply.

Paul shrugs. Pours Anna some wine as she looks through

the menu. The Waiter taps his pen on his pad

impatiently. Anna sighs. Puts the menu aside.

Paul smiles as the Waiter leaves. Anna tries to ignore

him. But after a second she can't help smiling back.

Anna's smile broadens. The tension between them broken

for the moment. Paul reaches across. Touches her hand.

Anna takes a sip of wine.

She picks up the bottle.    Checks the label.

Paul's momentarily thrown. He tries to cover it by

rearranging his napkin. Anna notices.

Now Anna's nervous.

Anna looks down.   Stares at her hands on the table.

Paul pauses as he reaches inside his jacket.

Paul's stunned.   Speechless.   Before he can say anything--

Paul reaches for her hand.     Anna gets up to leave.

The other DINERS turn and stare at them. Paul glances at

them embarrassed. Anna doesn't notice. Upset.

Anna grabs her coat.   Pushes her way through the restaurant.

Paul's suddenly aware that everyone's looking at him. He

quickly sits down. Drains his glass of wine. Furious.

INT/EXT. ANNA'S CAR - NIGHT

Anna closes the car door.   It's still raining hard outside.

Her hair, perfect minutes ago, is now bedraggled. Her make-

up's running. She places her hands on the steering wheel.

Trying desperately to pull herself together.

Suddenly. THUMP. Anna jumps. Turns. Paul's at the car

window. He thumps the glass again. Anna hits the locks.

EXT. RESTAURANT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

Paul grabs the door handle.

INT/EXT. ANNA'S CAR - CONTINUOUS

Anna can't hear him above the sound of the RAIN HAMMERING

onto the car. She shakes her head. Puts the car in drive.

EXT. RESTAURANT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

Paul stumbles aside as Anna's car pulls away. She stops

at the parking lot exit a short distance away.

INT/EXT. ANNA'S CAR - CONTINUOUS

Anna looks up into the rearview mirror.

ON REARVIEW MIRROR

Paul stands forlornly in the rain.      Their eyes meet.

She hesitates.       For a moment we think she might go back

to him...

EXT. RESTAURANT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

... but then Anna pulls out and drives away. Leaving Paul

alone in the parking lot. The rain pounding the asphalt.

INT/EXT. ANNA'S CAR. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

Anna peers through the blurred windshield as the wipers

battle with the TORRENTIAL DOWNPOUR. A LARGE TRUCK plows

past menacingly on the rain-slicked highway.

Anna's still upset. She wipes away her tears. On the

dashboard the kitschy doll bobs its head from side to

side. Anna picks up her cell phone. Glances down as she

dials a number. She looks up...

a WHITE VAN with black tinted windows cuts in front of her.

Anna swerves into the next lane.      We hear the blaring

horn from the car behind her.

The cell phone connects.      We hear Paul's answering machine.

Anna drops the phone into her bag on the passenger seat.

Wipes away the mist on the inside of the glass.

A TRACTOR TRAILER shudders past loaded with metal pipes.

ON METAL PIPES

The badly loaded pipes BANG OMINOUSLY against each other.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. ELIOT'S ROOM - EARLY MORNING

Darkness.   A bright light comes on.

CLOSE ON a MAN'S HANDS. Turning slowly under a stream of

crystal blue water. We pull back. Eliot dries his hands.

Opens a cabinet. Takes out a pair of latex gloves.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - EARLY MORNING

A large room. Tall vaulted ceilings. White tiles. Soft

morning light seeps in from a small round window set high

on one wall. The room is silent. Still. Like a chapel.

In the semi-darkness we see a BODY on a porcelain slab

covered with a white sheet.

We hear a key turn in a lock. Then another lock.       The

room's suddenly flooded with a harsh white light.

Eliot steps inside the room. He takes off his jacket.

Carefully places it on a coat-hanger. Puts on a pale

blue smock then snaps on the latex gloves. His every

move meticulous. Measured. Like a ritual.

Eliot walks over to the slab, his surgery clogs softly

clacking against the tiled floor. He looks at the slab

for a moment then slowly pulls the sheet away

revealing...

ANNA'S BODY. Pale and lifeless. An ugly gash above her

eyebrow. Cracked violet lips. A rip in her black dress

soaked with a dark stain. She's only wearing one shoe.

Eliot gently takes off the watch from her stiff wrist.

Places it inside a brown paper bag. Eases off the shoe.

Picks up a scalpel from a tray of instruments on a steel

trolley. Delicately slices open her dress. Peels it off.

He's about to cut the straps of her RED SLIP when...

Anna OPENS HER EYES.

She looks straight at us with unseeing pale blue eyes.

Strangely Eliot's not surprised.   He calmly steps back.

Watches her carefully.

Anna's eyes slowly focus on Eliot.     She's groggy.   Confused.

She talks with difficulty.       Her breathe labored.

Anna's vacant eyes widen in shock. She struggles to sit

up but she can't even raise her head. Her body stiff.

Rigid. Eliot speaks to her calmly. Soothingly.

She looks fearfully at the bloodied dress in Eliot's hand.

Eliot looks at her sadly for a moment. He places the

bloodied dress on the trolley. Then picks up a document.

Holds it up for her.

It's Anna's death certificate.

Anna stares with horror at her death certificate, then at

Eliot. He looks away. It pains him to see her so

distressed.

Eliot picks up a sponge from the trolley.   Wets it.

Eliot delicately washes Anna's face. She doesn't flinch

as he dabs the wound above her eye brow.

Eliot sighs wearily.   As if he'd had this conversation

many times before.

Eliot peels off his latex gloves and heads for the door.

As he hangs his pale blue smock on the peg he turns and

looks at Anna for a moment.

The lights go off. O.S. the door clicks shut as it locks

automatically behind Eliot.

INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. BEDROOM - MORNING

Paul wakes up. Badly hung-over. Still in his clothes.

Sunlight streams into the room. Blinding him. He

reaches across. The bed's empty. He's surprised for a

moment then remembers the argument the night before.

He gets up. Sits on the edge of the bed. Lights a

cigarette. He notices his jacket on the floor. Leans

down. As he pulls out the BlackBerry from his jacket, the

RING BOX falls onto the floor. Paul doesn't notice.

INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. KITCHEN - LATER

Paul steps into the kitchen. Nervously checking his

BlackBerry. Nothing. Just then he sees the red light

blinking on his answer machine. He presses play.

Paul's relieved. He picks up the phone.   Dials.   We hear

the ringing on the other end.

INT. HOSPITAL MORGUE - SAME TIME

Two technicians, an OLD GUY and his YOUNG PALE ASSISTANT,

push a NAKED BODY wrapped in plastic through the morgue.

They jump as they hear the MUFFLED sound of a cell phone.

The ringing comes from a bag speckled with blood lying on

a table (we recognize it as Anna's bag). The Assistant

walks over. Takes out the cell phone.

The ringing stops abruptly.   It's suddenly very silent.

As the Assistant reaches for the bag, he notices a

solitary shoe on the table. He picks it up.

The Assistant looks round. He can't see the other shoe

anywhere. He turns to the Old Guy and shrugs.

INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME

We hear a BEEP.

EXT. MOTHER'S HOUSE - DAY

Paul pulls up to a suburban house. Walks quickly to the

door, a supermarket bouquet of flowers wrapped in

cellophane in his hand. He rings the bell. No-one

answers. He rings again. Knocks hard on the door.

Still no answer. Paul looks around. Notices the

driveway's empty. He heads back to his car.

INT/EXT. PAUL'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

Paul's on his cell phone as he drives.    He gets Anna's

voice mail again.

INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. CORRIDOR - DAY

Paul strides down an empty corridor. The flowers in his

hand. Searching for Anna's classroom.

INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. BIOLOGY CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER

A TEACHER stands in front of the class holding a shell.

The door opens. Paul steps into the classroom.    His

smile fades as he realizes it's not Anna.

The Teacher quickly moves over.    Hustles Paul to the door.

The Teacher glances suspiciously at the flowers in his hand.

Jack's in the front row.   Following the conversation.

Paul's worried now.   Something's wrong.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - DAY

Anna lies rigidly on the slab. Her head turned to one

side. Staring blankly at the wall. Her eyes glazed.

Suddenly classical music fills the room. Anna frowns.

Disoriented. She moves her head with difficulty.

Nervously looks around.

For a moment she doesn't know where she is. Then she

sees Eliot by a CD player. She watches with trepidation

as he approaches her.

Anna doesn't know what to say.   She turns her head away.

A tear falls down her cheek.

Eliot moves her head back.   Gently wipes away her tear.

Eliot slides a wooden head-rest under her neck and studies

her wounds, touching them delicately. Thinking about how

to conceal them. He turns to a tray of instruments.

Picks up a needle. Leans over Anna.

The needle pierces her brow. Sliding cleanly through her

skin. She doesn't feel any pain as Eliot carefully sews

the wound. He's meticulous. Clearly very good at his job.

Eliot glances at his watch. Picks up a SYRINGE and an

AMPOULE OF AMBER LIQUID. Draws up the amber liquid.

Anna's alarmed. She tries to pull back.

He INJECTS Anna in the neck. Just then we hear a car

pull up on the gravel driveway outside.

Anna's eyelids feel very heavy. Slowly her eyes close.

Eliot pulls the white sheet over her body.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

A Nurse, DIANE (30s) follows Beatrice in her wheelchair

as Eliot leads them through the hallway.

He glances at her curiously.    Then gestures to his office.

It takes him a second to respond.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - DAY

Beatrice leans against the slab staring at Anna's covered

body. Eliot stands respectfully to one side. In the b.g.

Diane shivers. The room's cold. Beatrice touches Anna's

hand through the white sheet. Then uncovers Anna's face.

The needle's still embedded in her eyebrow.

Eliot quickly steps forward. Pulls out the needle.    Cuts

the thread with a pair of large scissors.

Beatrice stares at Anna.

She nods to Diane.    Diane helps her into the wheelchair.

Beatrice whirs towards the door.      She suddenly stops.

Turns to Eliot.

EXT. FUNERAL HOME. DRIVEWAY - DAY

Eliot watches Beatrice's car drive away.

INT/EXT. PAUL'S CAR - DAY

Paul waits in his car outside the Mother's house.        The

wilting flowers on the passenger seat beside him.

Beatrice's car pulls up. Diane gets out.      Pulls the

wheelchair out of the car.

Paul grabs the flowers.

EXT. MOTHER'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Paul strides over as Diane helps Beatrice into her

wheelchair.

Beatrice doesn't acknowledge him.   Paul turns to Diane.

Diane can't look him in the eye.

INT. MOTHER'S HOUSE. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Beatrice sits in her wheelchair with her back to the

door. Paul stops a short distance away.

Paul stares at Beatrice's back in disbelief.

Beatrice turns her wheelchair round to face Paul.

Beatrice glares at him.    She clearly blames him for

Anna's death.

Paul looks down guiltily at the flowers in his hand.

Beatrice pushes a joystick on her wheelchair.   As she

whirs past Paul she notices the flowers.

Paul's not listening anymore.   Stunned.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. KITCHEN - DAY

Eliot turns on the taps.   Fills a copper kettle.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME

Silence. O.S. a shuddering pipe bangs ominously. Anna

opens her eyes abruptly as if waking from a deep sleep.

She stares at us. Numb.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

CLOSE ON an exploding BLUE FLAME from a gas ring.

We pull back. Eliot places a kettle on the ring. Then

measures out exactly two spoons of tea from an ornate tin

into a teapot. Meticulous in everything he does.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME

CLOSE ON Anna's hand. Her fingers FLEX slightly. She

pushes herself up awkwardly. Suddenly realizes

something. She touches her wrist. Desperately searching

for her pulse. Then frantically checks her neck.

Panicking. She can't find her heartbeat.

She stares at her hand. Then abruptly SLAMS it against

the slab. Hard. She feels no pain. She does it again.

Harder. Still nothing.

She struggles to her feet. Stumbles groggily to the door.

Tries the door handle. It's locked. She bangs on the

door feebly. Then she hears something. She cocks her

head. Follows the sound of Eliot's footsteps upstairs.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. ELIOT'S OFFICE - DAY

Eliot's by his desk. Checking his appointment book.

Whistling softly to himself. We can't hear Anna's cries.

He pours a cup of tea. Adds a drop of milk. As he stirs

his tea, he hears the sound of feet CRUNCHING on the

gravel outside. He glances out the window.

Paul stands in the middle of the driveway staring blankly

at the Funeral Home.

EXT. FUNERAL HOME. DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Eliot steps out of the Funeral Home.     Heads towards Paul.

Paul turns to him.   Pulled away from his thoughts.

Eliot smiles.    Holds out his hand.

As they shake, Eliot looks at Paul's hand strangely.    As

if he senses something.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME

Anna suddenly hears Paul's loud voice outside.

She frantically beats her fists against the door.

EXT. FUNERAL HOME. DRIVEWAY - SAME TIME

Paul quickly controls his anger.    His eyes smart with tears.

Paul's voice breaks with emotion. He can't go on. Eliot

gently takes him by the elbow. Leads him back to his car.

Paul looks defeated. He simply nods his head.     Eliot

watches him get into his car and drive away.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - LATER

Anna sits by the door in the darkness. Suddenly the

room's flooded with light. Eliot walks in. Looks at

Anna for a moment. She just stares back at him coldly.

He heads over to the sink.

A long beat.

Eliot smiles. Amused she caught him out.   He continues

washing his hands.

Anna looks up sharply.   Eliot's clearly hit a nerve.

Eliot shrugs.   Dries his hands on a white towel.

He shakes his head as he drops the towel into a small bin.

Eliot's taken aback.    Hurt.

He heads to the door. Pulls out his keys and unlocks it.

Just then he remembers something. Turns to her.

He looks her up and down.   Gauging her height.

Anna's stunned. Eliot looks at her for a moment.     Then

switches off the main lights.

He ignores her.   The door CLICKS shut behind him.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Eliot steps into the hallway. Stops by a vase of

flowers. He plucks a dead petal. Crushes it. Curiously

sniffs his fingers. Then heads to the casket room.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - DAY

CLOSE ON Anna's face. She looks empty. Dispirited.

Just then something catches her attention...

The light from the window glints off a pair of LARGE

SCISSORS on the steel trolley. Anna stumbles to the

trolley. Feeling her way through the semi-darkness.

Grabs the scissors.

Just then she notices a BODY, covered with a white sheet,

lying on a gurney in the corner. She turns away.

Scared. But then, almost against her will, she

approaches the gurney. As if drawn to the body. She

slowly pulls the sheet away...

The dead body of an OLD WOMAN. Staring blindly at Anna

with cloudy opaque eyes. Long greasy gray hair. Shaken,

Anna pushes herself against the wall.

INT. JACK'S HOUSE. KITCHEN - DAY

Jack carefully cuts something out of a local newspaper.

The loud sounds of a TV blare from another room.

Schoolteacher Dies in Tragic Car Crash.

INT. JACK'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

The curtains are drawn. JACK'S MOTHER sits in an

armchair with her back to us watching TV. Jack walks in.

His mother doesn't reply.   Jack moves in front of the TV.

His mother doesn't respond.

EXT. STREETS - DAY

Jack furiously cycles through empty streets. Past

identical suburban houses with identical prim lawns. He

stops suddenly. Considering something. Then turns and

cycles away purposely.

EXT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY

Eliot walks out of the funeral home. We pull back. Jack

stands by his bicycle in the bushes watching him. Eliot

looks up. As if sensing someone was spying on him. Jack

steps back quickly behind a tree.

INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

A POLICE OFFICER talks on the phone as Paul walks in.

Paul nods.    Clearly doesn't want to talk about it.

As Paul walks away, the Officer returns to the phone.

INT. POLICE STATION. CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

Paul slides a dollar bill into a coffee machine. Presses

his selection. Nothing.

He pushes the button repeatedly.   Then angrily slams the

side of the machine. Nothing.

As Paul turns away, he notices a door with a sign on it:

AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY. Paul glances around. Then

quickly walks over to the door.

INT. POLICE STATION. GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

A dozen wrecked cars. Twisted metal. Paul's footsteps

echo through the empty garage. It's dark. Out the

corner of his eye Paul glimpses a SHAPE move quickly

around a pillar. He stops. Unsettled.

Just then we hear a WOMAN'S FOOTSTEPS. Her high-heels

clicking on the concrete floor. There's something

strange about the sound. UNNATURAL. Paul listens

nervously. The footsteps grow fainter. Then fade away.

The garage is silent again. Too quiet.

Paul moves apprehensively over to Anna's GREEN TOYOTA.

The car's a mess. One side's completely caved in. He

touches the car.   Pulls open the door. Squeezes into

the driver's seat.

Glass everywhere. Paul glances at the KITSCHY BOBBLEHEAD

DOLL on the dashboard flecked with blood. He places his

hands on the steering wheel. Suddenly he hears a strange

noise. He looks up...

The KITSCHY DOLL. Its head NODDING SLOWLY. Its smiling

face now unnaturally sinister. Turning towards us until

it abruptly stops. Staring straight at us.

Paul looks at the doll transfixed. Just then a PALE

WOMAN'S HAND slowly reaches through the window... and

touches Paul's shoulder. He jumps. Turns.

ANNA stands by the car. Staring blankly at him.   The

color drains from Paul's face.

The Police Captain, Tom Peterson, stands by the car where

Anna was a second ago. He pulls his hand away from

Paul's shoulder. Looks at him with concern.

Paul gathers his composure. He must have just imagined

Anna was there. He shoves the door open. He's about to

step out when he turns back and grabs the Kitschy Doll.

Paul gets out awkwardly.    He can't look Tom in the eye.

Paul nods slowly.    Tom notices the Kitschy Doll.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY

Eliot stops by a thermostat. Studies it for a moment.

Turns it lower. He glances at his watch. Takes out his

keys from his jacket and moves over to the Prep Room door.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Anna sits on the slab. Her hands behind her back.    She

carefully watches Eliot as he pulls on his pale blue

smock then walks over to a cabinet.

BEHIND ANNA'S BACK

her hands clutch the large scissors.

Eliot opens a cabinet full of boxes of hair dye with

photographs of smiling women. As he prepares the dye he

looks across at Anna. She's staring at something behind

him. Eliot turns. Sees the uncovered body of the Old

Woman on the gurney. He quickly walks over. Carefully

pulls the white sheet over the Old Woman.

He mixes the dye in a bowl as he moves over to Anna.

Anna's hand suddenly FLIES UP...   she slashes at Eliot's

face with the SCISSORS.

The sharp edge misses his cheek by inches. Eliot drops

the bowl. Stumbles back against the steel trolley.

Instruments crash to the floor.

Anna staggers to the door. Her legs weak. Her long lank

hair falling over her eyes. She frantically wrenches at

the door handle but it's locked. Eliot gets up. Slowly

moves towards Anna. She turns. Raises the scissors.

Eliot walks right up to her.     His face now inches from hers.

Anna doesn't move. Eliot looks her steadily in the eye.

He reaches for her hand. Slowly. Deliberately. He brings

the scissors to his cheek. Then lets go of Anna's hand.

CLOSE ON ELIOT'S FACE

The sharp tip pushes into his skin.

For a moment we think she might do it.      But then she wavers.

Anna's confidence falters. She slowly lowers her hand.

The scissors fall onto the floor. Anna looks down

defeated. Her breath labored. Suddenly she realizes...

She's not listening. Eliot takes a roll of paper towels.

Kneels down, picks up the bowl of dye and mops up the mess.

He stands up.    Sighs wearily.

Anna's stunned. For the first time we sense a seed of

doubt in her mind.

Anna's silent. Trying to make sense of what she's just

heard. Eliot takes her arm. Leads her to the slab.

She lies down submissively. Suddenly very tired.       Eliot

leans over her to apply what's left of the dye.

She weakly pushes him away. Anger flashes across Eliot's

face, but just as quickly he controls it.

Anna doesn't know what to say.

Anna turns her head away.   Clearly he's struck a chord.

Eliot rips off his latex gloves.    Tosses them into a bin.

Eliot stands in the doorway. He switches off the light.

His body silhouetted by the light from the hallway.

The door clicks shut behind him. Anna doesn't move.

Clearly unsettled by Eliot's words. After a moment she

looks at the Old Woman. She moves over. Hesitantly

pulls away the white sheet. Stares at the Old Woman

curiously. Then tentatively touches her cheek.

She takes the Old Woman's hand.      Strokes her paper-thin skin.

Anna notices the Old Woman's plastic ankle tag.

ON PLASTIC ANKLE TAG

Name: Carol Whitehall.     Sex: F.   DOB: 11.02.30.

Anna turns back.   Studies the Old Woman's serene face.

Anna's eyes fill with tears.

INT. JACK'S HOUSE. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Jack lies in bed staring at the ceiling. On his bedside

table an alarm clock reads 2.38AM. He looks across at an

Anglepoise lamp in the corner of the room bent over an open

shoebox. He gets up. Walks towards the muted light.

The SMALL CHICK huddles in the shoebox. It looks dead even

though it's eyes are open. Jack's about to reach into the

box. Then changes his mind. He looks at the lamp. Switches

it off. After a moment he switches it back on again.

INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Paul stands motionless in the middle of the room. Staring

blankly into space. The room feels empty and depressing.

He suddenly looks around. Not quite sure why he came into

the room in the first place. He moves over to a CD player.

Mechanically switches it on. Music fills the room. He

turns the volume higher. Then all the way up. The music's

unbearably loud but Paul just stands there. Numb.

The music's strangely distorted now.        Almost silent.   As

if we were inside Paul's head.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - NIGHT

Anna lies on the slab. Curled in a fetal position. O.S.

we hear the UNNATURALLY LOUD metallic drip of a faulty

faucet. Slow. Rhythmical. Anna opens her eyes. Stares

at us. Terrified. Then she turns her head.

The Old Woman sits on the other slab. Slowly brushing

her tangled gray hair with a silver backed brush.

Anna looks around anxiously. The room is strangely

larger. The perspective not quite right. Certain

objects look absurdly small or abnormally large. She

notices a TINY DOOR. Half hidden by a steel trolley.

The door's slightly ajar. Anna's surprised.

The Old Woman shakes her head. Staring blindly at Anna

with opaque eyes. Anna ignores her. Moves quickly to

the tiny door. As she approaches, the door seems to grow

to normal size.

Then we realize it's Anna who has shrunk. The steel

trolley now towers high above her. The massive

instruments on the trolley look like menacing insects

cast in surgical steel. She opens the door. Revealing a

solid wall of DARKNESS.

FROM INSIDE THE DARKNESS

the small shape of Anna in the doorway. The huge dark

space engulfs her. The only light comes from the Prep

Room behind her.

Anna reaches forward. Her hand disappears into the thick

blackness. She snatches her hand back. Scared. Then...

...a CHILD'S HAND darts out of the darkness. Grabs Anna's

wrist. Pulling her in with surprising strength. Anna

struggles to free herself. But the hand drags her deeper

into the darkness. The door slams shut behind her.

INT. DARKNESS

Anna stands in the black empty space.

An innocent looking YOUNG GIRL (6) materializes out of

the blackness. She looks like a young Anna.

The Young Girl walks slowly towards Anna.

Anna shakes her head.

The Girl now looks strangely malevolent. Anna steps back

terrified. Turns. But there's no door anymore.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME

The Old Woman stands alone in the middle of the room.

Braiding her long hair.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. VIEWING ROOM - DAY

A small congregation of MOURNERS sit in the white chairs.

"AVE MARIA" plays quietly in the b.g. A MAN leans over

the casket paying his respects.

The Old Woman.   Her long hair braided.   She looks serene.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME

"AVE MARIA" filters into the room. Anna opens her eyes.

She's confused. She gets up awkwardly. Looks around the

room. The other slab's empty. The Old Woman's gone.

Anna stumbles over to the trolley. Pushes it aside.

Desperately searching for the tiny door. She touches the

wall. There's nothing there. Frustrated she turns to a

counter crowded with instruments. She sweeps her arm

across the counter top in rage. Sending everything

crashing to the floor.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. VIEWING ROOM - DAY

The funeral's over. Eliot takes out a wilted bouquet of

flowers from a vase.

In the b.g. Jack stands half-hidden in the doorway.

Glancing around in fascination. A flower in his hand.

Jack steps back timidly.   Eliot looks up.   Smiles.

Jack nods hesitantly.   Moves over and takes the flowers.

Eliot turns and arranges fresh flowers in the vase.

as he looks at the wilted flowers.    He crushes a petal

then sniffs his fingers.

Jack looks up.   Eliot's watching him carefully.

Jack turns to leave.

Jack's suddenly nervous.

Eliot considers the question for a moment.

Jack holds out his hand. A serious look on his face.

Eliot's amused. He shakes Jack's hand.

Eliot finished arranging the flowers.     He glances at his

watch. Smiles at Jack.

Jack's intrigued.   He watches Eliot walk out of the room.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. BASEMENT CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

As Eliot heads to the Prep Room, we hear a MUFFLED CRASH

from inside. Eliot quickly pulls out his keys. Moves to

the door. Just then Eliot hears a creaking sound behind

him. He turns. Jack's at the top of the stairs.

Staring down curiously at the Prep Room door.

Eliot observes him cautiously. Did Jack hear the sound

as well? Jack looks back at Eliot. Smiles. Then

without a word, turns and heads back up the stairs.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Anna sits on the floor in the middle of the room.

Hugging her legs to her chest. Rocking to and fro.

Surrounded by broken glass, torn papers and instruments.

Eliot enters the room. Coldly surveys the destruction.

Anna ignores him.   Eliot strides over to her.

Anna stares at him blankly.

Strangely Eliot's not surprised.   He nods his head.   His

anger gone now.

Eliot softly strokes her hair.    Comforting her.

For a moment we see a deep sadness in Eliot's eyes. He's

conflicted. But then abruptly he pulls himself together.

Moves away and starts clearing up. Anna closes her eyes.

Hugs her legs closer to her chest.

She lets out a DESPONDENT SIGH.   The SIGH carries into

the next scene...

EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

The tall trees stand motionless amongst the graves. A

sudden GUST OF WIND bends the dense foliage. Their

leaves ripple. Languid and fluid like a wave. RUSTLING

EERILY. The sound almost malevolent.

INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. BEDROOM - DAY

Paul's red-rimmed eyes snap open. He lies on his bed

fully clothed. An empty bottle of bourbon on the bedside

table. Behind him the curtains stir.

The KITSCHY DOLL'S head begins to slowly nod. Turning

towards us. We hear the eerie rustling sound again.

Like a MURMURING WHISPER...

Paul turns quickly. Sees the open window. It's only the

wind. He shivers. It suddenly got very cold. He gets

up and closes the window. The WHISPERING starts again.

This time from the bathroom.

Paul walks over to the bathroom door. As he touches the

door handle... the whispering STOPS. Paul hesitates.

The room's strangely silent. He slowly opens the door...

INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

Nothing. The bathroom's empty. Paul looks around

nervously. He catches the reflection of his pallid face

in the mirror. Leans wearily against the washbasin.

Water DRIPS from a leaky pipe. The fluorescent bulb over

the mirror CRACKLES softly. Paul turns on the taps.

Splashes cold water on his face. He's about to reach for

a towel when he senses something. He cocks his head

slightly. A feeling.

He turns and checks out the bathroom. Nothing. Paul

dries his face. As he replaces the towel... the sound of

dripping water ABRUPTLY STOPS. Silence.

Suddenly the SHOWER STARTS RUNNING.

Paul's paralyzed with fear. Steam wreathes the room in a

cloud of vapor. He turns slowly towards the shower.

Anna stands in front of the shower with her back to him.

She slips off her bathrobe and hangs it on a hook. Then

her hand moves to her chest. There's a STRANGE WET

SUCKING sound...

...as Anna rips out her heart and hangs it casually on

the hook next to her bathrobe.

ON THE STILL BEATING HEART

dripping crimson blood onto the bone white tiles.

Anna turns slowly. Her skin's like alabaster. Unnaturally

translucent. A bloody gash where her heart used to be.

The steam from the shower curls around her like a mist.

She looks hauntingly beautiful. Mesmerizing. A line of

thick black fluid trickles from her nose. Paul turns

away. Horrified. When he turns back a second later

Anna's not there. The bathroom's empty. The shower's

not even running.

INT. JACK'S HOUSE. KITCHEN - EVENING

Jack opens the fridge. It's almost empty. He takes out

a carton of milk. Sniffs it. Recoils from the smell.

From the living room we hear the LOUD sound of a TV.

There's no reply.      Jack grabs his jacket.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - EVENING

Anna's still sitting on the floor. The place is clean

and ordered again. She watches Eliot unzip a garment

bag. He lifts out a plain black dress.

As Eliot takes out a pair of shiny black shoes from a

plastic bag, Anna moves haltingly over to the dress. She

touches the material puzzled.

Eliot starts folding the plastic bag. He notices

something else inside. He opens the bag. Hesitates then

takes something out.

ON ELIOT'S HAND

An old-fashioned wooden rosary.

Eliot looks at it for a moment. Then glances over at

Anna. She's still staring at the dress. He opens a

drawer beneath the counter. It's full of rosaries and

printed Holy cards. He quickly drops the rosary into the

drawer. Closes it. Then turns back to Anna.

Eliot unlocks the door. Jams it open with a door stop.

Slips his keys back into his jacket pocket. Takes off

his jacket and hangs it up. He moves over to a

collapsible gurney folded on the floor. Bends down and

snaps open the side-rails. Anna looks at the open door.

Eliot looks up at Anna sadly.

She glances at the open door again.    Eliot follows her look.

As Eliot turns back to the gurney, Anna notices Eliot's

jacket hanging beside her. Realizes the KEYS are in the

pocket. She quickly glances back at Eliot. He's still

busy adjusting the gurney. She leans over to his jacket.

as he gets up and turns to Anna.

Anna looks at him calmly. We can't tell if she managed to

get his keys or not. Eliot pulls on his jacket and wheels

the gurney through the door. He steps back into the room.

Nudges the door stop away with his foot.

The door locks behind him with a CLICK.

EXT. FUNERAL HOME. DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Eliot pushes the gurney to a WHITE VAN with black tinted

windows (Note: The same kind of van that cut in front of

Anna just before the accident).

INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME

Anna listens anxiously to the CRUNCH of Eliot's feet on

the gravel outside. After a moment she hears the van

drive away. She unfurls her fist revealing Eliot's keys.

INT/EXT. ELIOT'S VAN. STREETS - MOMENTS LATER

As Eliot slides in a CD he notices the fuel gauge. He's

low on gas. He glances into his rear-view mirror and

makes a left turn.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME

Anna staggers to the door. There's at least a dozen keys.

She frantically chooses one and shoves it into the lock.

It doesn't fit. She's panicking. She fumbles for

another key. It almost fits. She forces it. The key

SNAPS OFF LOUDLY in the lock.

Anna looks around desperately. Sees a tray of instruments

on the steel trolley. She scrambles over. Finds a pair of

surgical pliers. She moves back to the door.

EXT. GAS STATION - LATER

Eliot replaces the pump nozzle.   Walks over to the cashier.

In the b.g. Jack, a carton of milk in his hand, steps out

of the gas station. Eliot doesn't notice him as he pulls

out a roll of notes. Hands over two twenties. Then he

frowns. Something's wrong. He checks his pockets again.

He can't find his keys. He walks quickly away.

Eliot ignores him. Scrambles into his van. Intrigued,

Jack watches Eliot drive away. Then unlocks his bicycle.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME

Anna's still trying to pry out the broken key.

INT/EXT. ELIOT'S VAN. STREETS - SAME TIME

Eliot's at a red light. Drumming his fingers in

frustration as he waits for the light to change.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Finally Anna pulls out the broken key. Quickly chooses

another. Turns it gently. Again it doesn't fit. Anna's

hysterical now. She tries the next key. It fits! She's

stunned for a second. Then pulls open the door.

INT/EXT. ELIOT'S VAN. STREETS - SAME TIME

Eliot turns sharply into a small road by the cemetery.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT

Anna staggers to the front door. She pulls at the door.

It won't open. Frantically she finds the key. Unlocks the

door, leaving the keys in the lock. As she opens the door,

HEADLIGHTS sweep across the hallway.

Eliot's van pulls up in front of the house.

Anna's trapped. We hear the CRUNCH of Eliot's footsteps

on the gravel outside. Anna looks round desperately.

EXT. FUNERAL HOME. DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

Eliot reaches the front door. It's slightly ajar.   He

pushes it open. Steps warily inside.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. ENTRANCE HALL - CONTINUOUS

Eliot looks around. The entrance hall's empty.   Then he

notices the keys in the lock.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

It's dark. Anna pulls at the back door. It won't budge.

She panics. Sees a kitchen knife on the counter.

Quickly grabs it. As she steps back, she knocks over a

metal bucket. The sound's DEAFENING in the silent house.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. ENTRANCE HALL - CONTINUOUS

Eliot hears the NOISE. Smiles. He calmly locks the door

and puts the keys into his pocket. Moves down the

hallway towards the kitchen.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Eliot switches on the light.   The kitchen's empty.    He

steps back into the hallway.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

He stands very still.    Watching.   Waiting.   We pull back.

JUST AROUND THE CORNER

Anna pushes herself against the wall clutching the knife.

Eliot turns towards her... then at the last moment

changes his mind. Heads in the opposite direction

towards the viewing room.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. VIEWING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Eliot steps carefully into the viewing room. Looks

around. Just then we hear the sound of bare feet

STAMPING along the hallway behind him.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. ENTRANCE HALL - SAME TIME

Anna runs to the front door. It's locked. She glances

around anxiously. Sees a staircase leading upstairs.

She weakly stumbles up the stairs.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

Anna walks along the corridor. She peers into a room.

Notices a TELEPHONE on a table. She moves over to the

telephone. The door CREAKS closed behind her.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. ENTRANCE HALL - SAME TIME

Eliot hears the CREAKING DOOR upstairs.    He cocks his

head upwards. Straining to listen.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. UPSTAIRS ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Anna frantically punches the buttons on the phone.

INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME

A telephone RINGS in the empty kitchen.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. UPSTAIRS ROOM - SAME TIME

Anna rocks back and forth as she anxiously listens to the

RINGING on the other end.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. STAIRS - SAME TIME

Eliot slowly climbs the stairs.

INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME

The phone continues to RING. We pull back. Paul stares

at the phone blankly. A drink in his hand. He looks

worse than before. Dark circles under his eyes.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. UPSTAIRS ROOM - SAME TIME

Anna glances back to the door in panic.

INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME

Finally Paul reaches across and picks up the phone.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. UPSTAIRS ROOM - SAME TIME

Anna cups her hand around the mouthpiece.

INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME

Anna's HOARSE DISTORTED VOICE sounds almost malevolent.

Paul's stunned. He stares at the phone as if it was

possessed. Then slowly puts it down.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. UPSTAIRS ROOM - SAME TIME

Anna looks at the phone in disbelief. The MONOTONOUS

TONE DRONES in the ear piece. She doesn't notice Eliot

appear in the doorway.

Suddenly the light comes on.

Anna drops the phone. Backs away towards a window.      Eliot

walks over and calmly replaces the phone.

Eliot places his hands on her shoulders.    Turns her

towards a tall mirror.

A PALE CADAVEROUS WOMAN. Sunken eyes.      A blood-stained

tear in the side of her RED SLIP.

Anna's stunned. She moves closer to the mirror.      Touches

her reflection through a thin layer of dust.

Anna stares blankly at her image in the mirror.

Eliot smiles. Like a father proud of his child's first

step. Just then he notices something outside. We see a

brief flicker of unease in Eliot's eyes.

Jack stands in the driveway holding his bicycle.    Looking

up at the Funeral Home. Transfixed.

EXT. FUNERAL HOME. DRIVEWAY

Anna in her RED SLIP by the mirror. She looks frightening

in the harsh light. Deathly pale. Like a ghost.

Strangely Jack isn't scared. He continues staring up at

the window. Calmly. Curiously.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. UPSTAIRS ROOM - SAME TIME

Eliot coolly turns back to Anna. She hasn't noticed

Jack. Still staring at her reflection in the mirror.

INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Paul stares at the telephone. After a moment he slowly

pulls the telephone plug out of the wall. Mechanically

grabs a plastic bin liner from underneath the sink.

INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Paul opens the wardrobe. Pulls out Anna's clothes. Stuffs

them into the bin liner. He notices the Kitschy Doll.

Shoves it in with Anna's clothes.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - DAY

Anna lies on the slab. She stares at us blankly. Her

face emotionless. Resigned. Eliot rinses her hair now

dyed back to brown. She slowly closes her eyes.

CLOSE ON RED DYE draining into the sink.

Eliot picks up the scissors. Carefully slices open

Anna's red slip. Delicately peels the slip off her body.

Anna doesn't react.

CLOSE ON Anna. She opens her eyes. Confused.     She turns

her head... she's in PAUL'S BEDROOM.

INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Paul lies in bed next to her watching her intently.     He

looks different. Clean shaven. Sober.

Paul doesn't reply.    She turns... the bed's empty.

Anna looks up. Paul's in the doorway.    She gets up.

Suddenly the light goes off.

The light comes back on.   Paul stands by the light switch.

Anna's getting nervous.    Something's not right.

Suddenly he looks at her reproachfully.

CLOSE ON Anna's face.    She looks away guiltily.

Anna closes her eyes.    Unable to answer.

Suddenly we hear the strident ringing of a phone.

Anna's eyes snap open in shock...

INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Eliot stands over her. We're back in the PREP ROOM.   We

hear the faint ringing of a phone from upstairs.

Upstairs the phone keeps on ringing.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. ELIOT'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Eliot takes notes as he talks on the phone. He looks at

a day calendar on his desk. Idly flips over the page

from Tuesday to Wednesday.

He glances at his watch.

INT. HOSPITAL MORGUE - DAY

GRAY BODIES lie on steel tables. Eliot moves over to one

of the CORPSES. Examines it with professional interest.

Just then the Old Guy walks in with the Pale Assistant

pushing a gurney with a BODY wrapped in plastic sheeting.

The Old Guy hands Eliot a clipboard. The Assistant

unties the rope. Pulls the plastic sheeting away.

FRANK (40s), the top half of his head has been flattened.

His head split open. Grotesquely distorting his face.

Eliot glances at the Assistant with disdain. Signs the

release form and hands the clipboard back to the Old Guy.

INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. TEACHERS' COMMON ROOM - DAY

Paul stands by a PRINCIPAL as they watch a JANITOR snap

off the padlock on Anna's locker.

The Principal and Janitor walk away. Paul reaches inside

the locker. Pulls out a stack of exercise books. An

empty pills bottle. Then he notices something in the

back of the locker. He pulls it out.

It's a PHOTOGRAPH of Paul and Anna together on vacation.

Smiling. Happy. Paul looks at it for a moment. Trying

hard to hold back his emotions.

INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. CORRIDOR - LATER

The DEAFENING NOISE of schoolchildren.    Paul weaves his

way through the crowded corridor.

Paul looks at Jack coldly for a second.    Then walks away.

Jack follows him.

Paul stops.   Turns to Jack angrily.

Paul's words ECHO loudly.   The bustling corridor goes silent.

Paul turns and walks away.    Jack grabs his arm.

Paul turns and hits Jack with the back of his hand.     Jack

falls to the ground. Paul stands over him enraged.

He's about to hit Jack again when a STOCKY TEACHER grabs

him. Paul tries to struggle loose.

The CHILDREN stare at Paul. A SECURITY GUARD runs across

talking into a walkie-talkie. Another TEACHER bends down.

Jack nods numbly. Looking up all the time at Paul.      The

Security Guard grabs Paul's arm.

Paul watches Jack stand shakily.   Realizes what he's

done. He reaches out to Jack.

INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. SECURITY ROOM - DAY

Paul sits at a table. Staring blankly at a row of CCTV

monitors. The door opens. Tom walks in.

Paul doesn't look up.     He's miles away.

Tom's relieved. Paul turns back to the monitors.     The

ghostly figure of a YOUNG FEMALE TEACHER drifts

hypnotically across the screen.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - DAY

Eliot leans over Frank's body on the slab. Rolling a

ball of wax in his hands to warm it up. He gently moves

Frank's head to one side. In the b.g. Anna lies on her

slab watching Eliot work.

Frank stares back at her with open dull eyes. His face

partially reconstructed with plaster of Paris.

Eliot smooths the wax over the plaster to give Frank's

face a more natural texture. Then picks up a piece of

wire with a fishhook-like barb at each end.

Eliot looks up surprised. Anna stands beside him.        He

leans down. Peels back Frank's upper lip.

Eliot imbeds one barb into the upper gum then pries back

Frank's lower lip. He attaches the other barb into the

lower gum, then twists the wires tightly together. He

picks up two plastic caps covered in small knobs.

He inserts the caps into Frank's eyes. Pulls his eyelids

over them. Glues the eyelids together.

Eliot looks at her for a moment.   Smiles reassuringly.

Anna touches the white sheet covering Frank's body.

We see a brief flicker of pain in Anna's eyes.

Anna suddenly looks very weary. She leans heavily

against the slab. As if she's about to fall.

He guides her back to the slab.    Helps her lie down.

Eliot strokes her hair tenderly.    She looks up at him.

A long beat.

Anna's fingers curl around his hand. Like a vulnerable

child. Totally trusting in him. Eliot looks down at Anna

sadly. We sense he's conflicted. Confused. Wavering.

But then reluctantly he reaches for a SYRINGE filled with

AMBER LIQUID on the steel trolley. He injects her gently

in the neck. Watches over her for a moment. Then moves

to the window. He picks up a window pole. Pulls the

shutter across the window plunging the room into darkness.

INT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY

Eliot moves through the Funeral Home pulling heavy drapes

over the windows and closing doors. It feels like a

ritual. The once airy sunlit rooms are darker now. More

ominous. Claustrophobic.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. ELIOT'S ROOM - DAY

CLOSE ON a stream of crystal blue water.    We pull back.

Eliot picks up a white towel. Dries his hands. Deep in

thought. He moves to his desk. Picks up a Polaroid.

The Old Woman, Mrs. Whitehall, lying in her casket.

Suddenly Eliot looks up sharply.   As if someone had spoken

to him.

Eliot moves over to the wall.

We pull back slowly. Eliot's talking to a POLAROID of an

OLD MAN. We pull back further... the wall's covered in

HUNDREDS OF POLAROIDS of BODIES in open coffins.

Most of them have closed eyes but we glimpse some with

their eyes wide open. Eerily staring at us. Eliot

touches the Polaroid of a YOUNG MAN. We see the fear in

the Young Man's eyes.

Just then we hear the doorbell ringing downstairs.    Eliot

moves to the window.

A POLICE OFFICER stands at the front door.    A SQUAD CAR

parked on the driveway.

Eliot steps back.    Calmly continues to dry his hands.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. HALLWAY - DAY

Eliot leads the Police Officer through the hallway.

Eliot stops.   We see a brief flicker of unease in his eyes.

Eliot glances at his watch.   Smiles at Vincent.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Eliot leads Vincent to Frank's covered body. Vincent

looks over at Anna. The white sheet only comes to her

shoulders, her head facing straight upwards.

Vincent turns back to Eliot. We're not sure if Eliot was

speaking to Frank or to Vincent. Eliot pulls the sheet

away. Frank's face is flawless. No sign of any damage.

Suddenly we hear a FAINT RUSTLING sound. Vincent glances

again at Anna's body. Her head is now turned to one side.

Wasn't she facing upwards a moment ago? Vincent's puzzled

for a second then shrugs. Must have been his imagination.

Eliot pulls the sheet over Anna's face.

Vincent frowns.   Turns back to Eliot.

Vincent nods towards Frank's body.

Vincent raises his fingers to his mouth, trying to find

the right word.

ON FRANK'S MOUTH

Eliot manipulates Frank's lips.

Eliot hesitates.      Then smiles.

As Eliot leaves, Vincent looks at Frank's body. After a

moment he glances at Anna again. Then at the door. He

quickly moves over to Anna. Looks at her curiously then

pulls down the sheet. He reaches over... and CARESSES

HER BREAST. Mesmerized by her naked body.

As Vincent's hand moves down her body, he bumps against

the trolley. Instruments CRASH to the floor. He pulls

back the sheet just as Eliot enters the room.

Eliot notices the sheet covering Anna's body is slightly

askew. He reaches over and straightens it. Then looks

coldly at Vincent. There's an uncomfortable silence.

Vincent glances one last time at Anna then leaves. The

door locking shut behind him. Eliot stares at the door.

Frank doesn't move.    His mouth still wired shut.

Eliot picks up a compact. Roughly layers Frank's cheeks

with thick rouge. With every word he gets more agitated.

Eliot's extremely irritated now.     He grabs a garish red

lipstick. Smears Frank's lips.

ON FRANK'S FACE

The crudely drawn bright red lips.     Clown-like circles of

rouge. Gaudy and macabre.

From Eliot's reaction it seems as if Frank has started to

talk again.

INT. JACK'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM - DAY

The curtains are drawn. Jack's Mother, still motionless,

in front of the blaring TV. Jack stops in the doorway.

His mother doesn't reply. Jack leaves. After a moment

she slowly turns her head. Stares at the empty doorway.

EXT. CEMETERY - LATER

Jack cycles through the cemetery. He pulls up by a bush.

Stares at the Funeral Home in the distance.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. VIEWING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

The service hasn't started yet. Jack walks nervously

through the empty room to an open casket. He glances

back, then leans over the coffin.

Frank Merano lies nestled in the velvet interior.    His

face placid. No sign of the gaudy make-up.

Jack stares in fascination at Frank's body. He reaches

into the casket. Touches Frank's cold hand.

In the b.g. Eliot walks into the viewing room.     He stops

surprised. Watches Jack intently.

Jack turns quickly.    Eliot stands over him.

Jack can't look Eliot in the eye.

Jack hesitates.   Then nods his head.

A long beat.

Jack looks up sharply.   Eliot's words have clearly struck a

chord.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - DAY

Anna stares vacantly at the ceiling. Eliot places a bunch

of tulips on the trolley. Turns on a CD. CLASSICAL MUSIC

fills the room as before. He moves over to Anna. Gently

Pulls away the sheet.

Eliot smiles.    Examines his nails.

He walks over to the sink.      Scrubs his nails.

Eliot fills a bowl with water.     Carries it to the slab.

Anna glances up at the shuttered window. Eliot snaps on

his latex gloves. Picks up a sponge and wets it in the

bowl of water. Anna turns to the tulips.

Eliot raises Anna's arm. Delicately washes her armpit.

Along the length of her arm. Her skin pale.

He moves to her breasts, following the contours of her

body. Pausing every now and then to rinse the sponge.

Eliot hesitates for a second before replying.

Eliot softly washes her legs.

Eliot puts down the sponge.      Dries her body with a towel.

He reaches over to the CD player to switch it off.

Eliot smiles.   Leaves the music on.

INT/EXT. PAUL'S CAR. STREETS - DAY

Paul drives aimlessly past strip malls. He stops at a

red light. Lights a cigarette. Just then he notices

something across the street. He looks puzzled.

EXT. STREET/STORE WINDOW - CONTINUOUS

Paul gets out of his car.    Quickly walks over to the

store window.

ON STORE WINDOW

A RED-SLIP on a mannequin.       Just like ANNA'S RED SLIP.

The light's turned green. The DRIVERS HONK angrily.

Paul doesn't hear them. He places his hand against the

plate glass. Stunned.

EXT. FUNERAL HOME. DRIVEWAY - DAY

Eliot prunes a low hedge by the front door.

Eliot turns.   Paul's clearly agitated.

Eliot stands stiffly.   Rubs his back.

Paul's momentarily taken aback.

Paul pushes past Eliot and strides into the Funeral Home.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Paul moves quickly through the hallway.

Eliot calmly heads towards Paul.

Paul notices the stairs leading down to the Prep Room.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. BASEMENT CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

Paul runs over to the Prep Room door. He grabs the handle.

It's locked. Eliot appears behind him. Paul turns.

Eliot stares at Paul with pity.

Paul turns back.   POUNDS the door in rage.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME

The POUNDING echoes through the room. Anna awkwardly

sits up. Struggling with her emotions. She wants to

call out but knows she has to let Paul go.

Anna gets up.   Hesitates.   Weakly stumbles to the door.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. BASEMENT CORRIDOR - SAME TIME

He places the palm of his hand against the door.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME

Anna places her palm against the door. As if touching

Paul's hand. A tear falls down her cheek.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. BASEMENT CORRIDOR - SAME TIME

Eliot looks up at Paul with sudden interest.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME

Anna shakes her head. Takes her hand away from the door.

Walks back to her slab.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. BASEMENT CORRIDOR - SAME TIME

Eliot gently puts his hand on Paul's shoulder.

Paul pushes him away.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME

Anna lies down on the slab. Closes her eyes.     ELIOT'S

VOICE seems far away now. Receding.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. BASEMENT CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

Eliot looks at him for a moment.

INT. POLICE STATION - DAY

An open plan office. Paul weaves quickly through the

rows of desks. He seems unbalanced. Manic. DETECTIVES

cautiously watch Paul approach Tom sitting at his desk,

his head bent over paperwork.

Tom looks up.       He's shocked by Paul's appearance.

JEFF (20s) a Young Detective at a nearby desk stands.

Tom nods to him. It's under control.

Paul hesitates for a second.

Paul sits.    Tom leans forward.    He's not amused.

Tom calmly gets up. Moves to a filing cabinet.   Takes

out a file. Hands it to Paul.

Paul manically rifles through the file.

Jeff looks up eagerly from his desk.

Tom shoots Jeff a look.

Paul turns hopefully. Finally someone believes him.

Vincent Merano stands by Jeff's desk.

Paul hesitates.    We sense his uncertainty.

Jeff snickers. Paul's beginning to realize how absurd

this all sounds.

Jeff snorts with laughter.

Merano and Jeff shake their heads, looking at Paul as if

he were crazy. Tom's voice softens.

Paul slumps in the chair.       Rubs his face.

Tom signals to Merano and Jeff. Merano walks back to his

desk. Jeff turns back to his work.

EXT. CEMETERY - LATE AFTERNOON

The sun's low on the horizon. Eliot whistles softly to

himself as he digs a grave. Working meticulously. Like

everything else he does. Suddenly a SHADOW falls over

Eliot. He calmly looks up. The sun's behind the figure.

For a moment Eliot can't tell who it is.

Eliot smiles. Gestures to Jack to come inside the grave.

Jack steps back. The grave terrifies him.

Jack carefully considers Eliot's words.

Eliot holds up the shovel. Jack looks at him for a

moment then reaches for the shovel.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - EVENING

Anna watches Eliot brush an invisible speck off her

mother's black dress.

She talks with difficulty now. Her voice SLURRED and

HOARSE. Her words muddled and rambling. Her eyes even

more sunken. Her skin even more pale.

Eliot looks away. Doesn't reply. He drapes the dress

over his arm, picks up a pair of shiny black shoes and

moves over to her.

Eliot lifts Anna's arms and puts them through the sleeves

of the dress. Her body's stiff and unyielding.

He delicately turns her onto her side.    Buttons up the dress.

Anna frowns. As if trying to remember something. Eliot

gently lifts her legs. Pulls on a pair of black tights.

She looks up at him.   Suddenly realizing.

Eliot picks up Anna's shoes.   Slips them onto her stiff feet.

Eliot picks up a nail-clipper. Gently holds Anna's hand

as he carefully cuts her long nails.

Eliot stops clipping her nails.   Irritated.

Anna turns away ashamed.   She knows he's right.

Anna's stunned.   She's finally admitted it.

Anna struggles to pull together her thoughts.

She looks down at the slab.     Touches the cold marble.

Eliot stares at her intently.    Comes to a decision.

Anna's puzzled. Eliot goes to the door and unlocks it.

Moonlight floods in from upstairs. Washing it with a cold

light. Anna doesn't move.

Eliot holds out his hand.   Anna takes it hesitantly and

rises from the slab.

EXT. FUNERAL HOME - NIGHT

Mist drifts through the cemetery. Anna stands in the

driveway. Pale and ghoulish in her black funeral dress

and shiny black shoes. She starts walking.

EXT. MOTHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Anna approaches her mother's house.    Paul opens the door.

He's not surprised to see her.

Beatrice stands just behind him.     A black shawl over her

head and arms.

INT. MOTHER'S HOUSE. HALLWAY - NIGHT

In the candlelight we can see the house is full of OLD

WOMEN. Their faces deeply lined. Wearing identical

black shawls. They stare at Anna, whispering in

different rhythms. Unintelligible words undulating like

an ANCIENT PRAYER.

INT. MOTHER'S HOUSE. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Paul and Beatrice lead Anna to the bed. As she lies down

we realize the bed is full of BLACK SOIL. Clouds of ugly

flies hang in the air. BUZZING noisily.

The Old Women surround Anna in a tight circle. Leaning

over her. Making her feel claustrophobic. She can smell

their rotting breath as their prayers grow LOUDER.

Through the chaos of words we begin to make out...

Anna doesn't understand. Then she feels something in her

mouth. Growing. Gagging her. The Women are SCREAMING.

Anna spits out... white maggots.     She gags again.   Closes

her eyes. Shakes her head.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - NIGHT

Anna's eyes snap open. She's still in the Prep Room.

She steps back from the doorway. Terrified.

Eliot switches off the lights.

EXT. ROAD BY FUNERAL HOME - NIGHT

Paul sits in his car. Staring out at the Funeral Home as

he nervously smokes a cigarette. The light in Eliot's

room goes off. Paul waits for a moment. Then gets out

of his car. Stubs out his cigarette.

EXT. FUNERAL HOME - MOMENTS LATER

Paul treads carefully along the side of the Funeral Home.

It's a full moon. The trees rustle ominously in the

wind. Casting eerie shadows against the dark house.

He finds a window. Tries to open it. It won't budge.

Just then he hears a noise in the bushes. He crouches

down quickly. Listens hard. Nothing.

FROM THE BUSHES

Someone watches Paul tentatively move to another window.

Paul strains to open the window when suddenly... he's

caught in a circle of bright light. Paul turns quickly.

A DARK FIGURE stands over him. Menacing.

The Figure lowers the flashlight.   It's Tom.

EXT. JACK'S HOUSE. GARDEN - NIGHT

CLOSE ON black earth.   A trowel digs into the soil.

We pull back. Jack's just finished digging a hole in the

flower bed. A shoebox beside him. He takes off the lid.

The Chick trembles in the corner of the box. Jack slowly

replaces the lid. Puts the box into the grave. He

pushes the earth over it. The box jerks. We hear the

faint RUSTLING of the Chick inside.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. ELIOT'S ROOM - DAWN

Eliot lies on his bed. Dressed in a dark suit. He hasn't

slept at all. His eyes rimmed red. He checks the clock on

the bedside table. It's 4.30am. He glances to the

window. Dawn light seeps into the room.

EXT. FUNERAL HOME - DAWN

Eliot walks through the garden. A pair of small secaters

in his hand. He stops by a bed of violets. Still

covered in morning dew. He kneels and starts cutting the

delicate flowers.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - DAWN

Anna lies on the slab in her burial dress.   Her eyes closed.

Eliot enters the room. He doesn't lock the door behind

him. Doesn't turn the lights on. Doesn't change into

his mortician smock.

He approaches the slab. The violets in his hand. Pulls

over a chair and sits next to Anna. Places the violets

on the steel trolley beside her.

He looks at her intently. For the first time he seems

uncertain. Vulnerable. As if questioning himself.

After a while he suddenly gets up and heads towards the

door. He's about to close the door behind him...

Her eyes still closed.

Eliot pauses.   Too confused to look back at her.

He closes the door.

INT. BEATRICE'S HOUSE. BEDROOM - DAY

CLOSE ON Beatrice's face.    Her eyes closed.

A HAND delicately powders her forehead. As if she's

being prepared for her own funeral. We pull back.

Beatrice, dressed in black, sits in front of a mirror.

Diane applies her make-up. Beatrice opens her eyes.

INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. BATHROOM - DAY

Paul, badly shaven, leans against the washbasin. Wearing

a crumpled black suit. Staring vacantly in the mirror.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - DAY

Anna lies in a casket as Eliot arranges her hair.

She looks up smiling. Eliot positions her hands,

entwining her fingers.

He picks up a SYRINGE and an ampoule of AMBER LIQUID.

Fills the syringe.

We glimpse the label: HYDRONIUM BROMIDE.

Eliot smiles.    Picks up a mirror.    Hands it to Anna.

Anna looks peaceful.    Beautiful.    Serene.

Anna nods.    SIGHS deeply... her BREATH FOGS the mirror.

She frowns. Touches the SMALL CIRCLE OF CONDENSATION on

the glass. Looks up at Eliot in shock.

Eliot glances anxiously at the fogged mirror, then at Anna.

Eliot injects her in the side of the neck. Anna tries to

raise her hand to push him away but she's too weak.

Anna's fading away.    Her hand drops limply to her side.

She stops struggling.    Stares blankly at us.

Eliot looks at her for   a moment. Sadly. Regretfully.

He picks up a Polaroid   camera. The flash explodes in a

blinding white light.    He pulls out the Polaroid. Peels

off the front and fans   it in the air. Then...

...delicately closes Anna's eyelids.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. VIEWING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

Anna's funeral is in progress.   Eliot stands by her

casket. Surrounded by wreathes of tulips and lilies.

Beatrice, in her wheelchair, in the front row. Diane

beside her. A SCHOOLTEACHER sits behind them with Jack

and other CHILDREN.

Tom and Paul appear at the door.   Tom guides Paul to a

seat near the back.

Anna lies in an open casket. Her eyes closed.     She can

hear the DISTORTED VOICE of the Priest.

ON ANNA'S FACE

We see an almost imperceptible frown.

Eliot gestures to Beatrice. Diane wheels her to the casket.

Beatrice looks at Anna for a moment, then touches the

violets in Anna's hands.

Next we see Mrs. Hutton at the casket. Then Jack. He

stares at Anna's body before being moved on by the

Schoolteacher. Finally Paul and Tom approach the coffin.

Anna looks serene.

Paul takes out the ring box from his pocket. Gently

slides the engagement ring onto Anna's stiff finger.

Suddenly he looks alarmed. Turns quickly to Tom.

Paul turns back to Anna.    Tears prick his eyes. He

touches her cheek again.    Finally accepting her death.

He kisses her lips. Eliot watches him carefully. It's

almost as if he's jealous. Jack notices Eliot's look

then turns and stares at Paul.

As Paul and Tom walk away Eliot closes the casket.

Begins to screw down the lid.

INT. INSIDE THE CASKET - SAME TIME

It's dark. We hear the screws TIGHTENING.      Anna's eyes

FLICKER OPEN then close again.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. VIEWING ROOM - SAME TIME

Just then Paul turns back sharply.      As if he sensed

Anna's reaction inside the casket.      Tom gently stops him.

Paul glances at the casket again, then reluctantly allows

Tom to lead him away.

Eliot tightens the last screw. His back to the room.

Suddenly the screwdriver slips. Gashes his finger.

A drop of blood falls onto the polished wood.

Eliot stares at the blood for a moment. Takes out a

pristine white handkerchief. Carefully wipes off the

blood. Then places his hand on the coffin.

Eliot turns.   Signals to the PALLBEARERS standing nearby.

EXT. CEMETERY. ANNA'S GRAVE - LATE AFTERNOON

The Pallbearers slowly lower Anna's casket into the open

grave. The casket lurches as it settles in the grave.

INT. INSIDE THE CASKET - SAME TIME

Anna's eyes SNAP OPEN in terror. She tries to scream out.

But only a SOFT RATTLING WHISPER escapes from her throat.

EXT. CEMETERY. ANNA'S GRAVE - SAME TIME

The TEACHER throws a handful of earth onto the coffin.

Jack steps up. Looks down curiously. As if he could

sense Anna. Then slowly pours the soil from his hand.

INT. INSIDE THE CASKET - SAME TIME

Blackness. Earth CLATTERS HEAVILY onto the wooden lid.

Anna GASPS softly. Hyperventilating. The earth keeps

falling. The sound becoming SOFTER with each shovelful.

She struggles. Bangs her fists against the wood.

EXT. CEMETERY. ANNA'S GRAVE - LATER

The grave's covered with a stone slab now. Votive candles

flicker on top. In the b.g. MOURNERS head to their cars.

Paul and Tom stand by the grave.

Tom squeezes Paul's shoulder then walks away.

INT. FUNERAL HOME. ELIOT'S ROOM - SAME TIME

Eliot carefully pins Anna's Polaroid to the wall.

We pan slowly across the other photographs we saw before.

But now we look at them differently. In some faces there

is the glimmer of life. In some a despairing pleading

look. In others passive resignation.

Eliot moves towards the window.

The dark cemetery. In the distance flickering candles

illuminate Anna's grave.

Eliot glances at his watch.

EXT. FUNERAL HOME. DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Paul unlocks his car. He's about to open the car door

when he feels someone watching him. He turns. Jack's

observing him carefully.

Paul simply nods his head.        Too drained of emotion to react.

Jack shakes his head.

Paul opens the car door.

Paul nods. Gets in his car.        Jack looks up at the

Funeral Home.

Eliot stands in the window smiling at him.

INT. MOTHER'S HOUSE. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

We're at Anna's wake.      PEOPLE talk quietly in small groups.

Paul fills a glass with whiskey. Knocks it back in one.

PEOPLE stare disapprovingly. WHISPERING to each other.

Paul turns. Eliot stands beside him.        Paul pours himself

another drink.

An ELDERLY COUPLE shake their heads and walk away.

Eliot's suddenly tired of Paul's allegations.

Paul's stunned.

Paul grabs Eliot by his lapels.   Shoves him against the wall.

The room's SILENT. Everyone turns towards Paul.   Eliot

whispers in Paul's ear.

Father Graham puts his hand on Paul's arm.

Paul pushes his hand away. Eliot shakes his head sadly.

Everyone looks at Paul with pity as he runs out.

EXT. MOTHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Paul sprints across the lawn to his car.

INT. PAUL'S CAR - NIGHT

Paul slips his key into the ignition.   His hand's shaking.

EXT. MOTHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Eliot watches Paul's car ROAR OFF.

INT. INSIDE THE CASKET - SAME TIME

We can't see a thing. But we can hear Anna's SHORT

SHALLOW GASPS. And the sound of her nails desperately

SCRATCHING at the coffin lid.

INT/EXT. PAUL'S CAR. ROAD - NIGHT

Paul drives fast. Accelerating then quickly braking as

he weaves through heavy traffic. He comes up behind a

slow Tractor-Trailer. Hits the HORN.

He swerves into the middle of the road. There's a blind

curve ahead... suddenly an SUV comes out of the corner.

A bright white light sweeps through his car.     Paul's

momentarily blinded.

Paul opens his eyes. The ROAD'S EMPTY. No sign of any

traffic. He's confused. The road was busy a moment ago.

Just then flashing red and orange lights illuminate the

car. Paul looks in his rear-view mirror.

ON REARVIEW MIRROR

An AMBULANCE moves quickly towards him.     Blasts past.

Paul looks through the front windshield.     Nothing.   He

frowns. Where did the ambulance go?

We see the Funeral Home.   Bone white in the moonlight.

The cemetery next to it.

EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

Eliot's White Van sits by the side of the road.

EXT. CEMETERY. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Paul's car slams to a halt. He jumps out. In the

distance the candles still burn on Anna's grave.

EXT. CEMETERY. ANNA'S GRAVE - MOMENTS LATER

Paul grabs a shovel by the grave. Starts digging. Then

the shovel clunks against wood. He kneels down. Scrapes

away the earth from the coffin. Then pulls open the lid.

Anna's eyes are WIDE OPEN.     Her fingernails torn and bloody.

Paul grabs her shoulders. Pulls her out of the grave.      Her

body slumps limply like a rag doll.

He desperately tries to revive her. But there's no life

left in her. He's about to give up when...

Anna's hand TWITCHES. Then after a moment she GASPS.

Her eyes slowly focus on Paul.

Paul gently helps Anna to her feet.    She looks round.

Dazed. Turns back to Paul.

Just then Paul hears a rustling sound behind him. He

turns. Nothing. He cocks his head slightly. There's

something unnerving about the silence.

Suddenly a CROW rises noisily into the air. Paul starts.

Then watches, relieved, as the crow disappears into the

dark sky. He turns back to Anna... she's not there.

Paul looks round desperately. Runs between the stone

crosses and statues of grieving angels searching for her.

Just then he glimpses SOMETHING MOVE among the trees.

Runs over. Nothing. The cemetery is empty. The trees

appear to SHIMMER for a moment. Paul shivers. Pulls his

jacket around him. He doesn't notice the candles on

Anna's grave behind him suddenly BLOW OUT.

INT/EXT. ELIOT'S VAN. ROAD - NIGHT

We hear the sound of a SIREN. The AMBULANCE blasts past.

Eliot slides a disc into the player. CLASSICAL MUSIC

fills the van. He strums the wheel. Enjoying the music.

EXT. CEMETERY. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Paul frantically runs into the parking lot.    Still

calling out for Anna.

Suddenly the interior light in his car comes on.    Paul

looks at the car nervously.

He heads over to it.   Apprehensive.   Then... the car door

slowly CLICKS open.

Paul stops.   Stares into the car.   There's no one there.

INT. PAUL'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

Through the windshield we see Paul approach the car.

He peers in nervously. Then cautiously gets in. As he

switches the interior light off, the camera moves slowly

around him revealing...

... ANNA sitting in the passenger seat.

Paul turns sharply.    Stunned.   Anna moves towards him.

Anna puts her fingers on Paul's lips. Clearly turned on.

We hear the sound of something being UNZIPPED.

A line of BLOOD trickles from his nose. He touches his

lips. Looks blankly at the blood on his fingertips. A

drop of blood falls on Paul's white shirt. It unfurls

like a flower. Spreading out over the material.

Anna hungrily kisses him. He responds passionately.

Suddenly we hear a SHARP METALLIC SOUND.

Anna responds as if it was nothing strange.

We see the growing anxiety in Paul's eyes.    Anna's just

interested in his lips.

Paul pulls back.   Terrified.

A strong bright light sweeps across Paul's face. Like

the headlights of the car on the blind curve earlier.

Paul blinks as he gradually gets used to the harsh light.

Slowly the room comes into focus...

INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - NIGHT

Eliot stands over Paul holding a pair of BLOODY SCISSORS.

Paul looks down. His white shirt soaked with blood, the

material sliced open.

He talks with difficulty.   His breath labored.

Jack appears at Eliot's side.

Paul's glazed eyes widen in shock.

Eliot speaks calmly.    Soothingly.

Eliot sighs wearily.    He's had this conversation many

times before.

Eliot's voice, with each word, fades further and further

away. Paul closes his eyes.
