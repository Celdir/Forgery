"The greatest miracle Christianity has achieved in America

is that the black man in white Christian hands has not grown

violent.  It is a miracle that 22 million black people have

not risen up against their oppressors--in which they would

have been justified by all moral criteria, and even by the

democratic tradition!  It is a miracle that a nation of

black people has so fervently continued to believe in a

turn-the-other-cheek and heaven-for-you-after-you-die

philosophy!  It is a miracle that the American Black people

have remained a peaceful people, while catching all the

centuries of hell that they have caught, here in white man's

heaven!  The miracle is that the white man's puppet Negro

'leaders,' his preachers and the educated Negroes laden with

degrees, and others who have been allowed to wax fat off

their black poor brothers, have been able to hold the black

masses quiet until now."

TITLES--WHITE ON BLACK

INT: WE LOVE RADIO STATION STOREFRONT--DAY

EXTREME CLOSE UP

WE SEE only big white teeth and very Negroidal (big) lips.

CAMERA MOVES BACK SLOWLY TO REVEAL MISTER SENOR LOVE DADDY,

a DJ, a radio personality, behind a microphone.

The CAMERA, which is STILL PULLING BACK, shows that Mister

Senor Love Daddy is actually sitting in a storefront window.

The control booth looks directly out onto the street.  This

is WE LOVE RADIO, a modest station with a loyal following,

right in the heart of the neighborhood.  The OPENING SHOT

will be a TRICK SHOT--the CAMERA PULLING BACK through the

storefront window.

He hits the cart machine and we hear a station jingle.

He laughs like a madman.

INT: DA MAYOR'S BEDROOM--DAY

An old, grizzled man stirs in the bed, his sheets are soaked

with sweat.  He flings them off his wet body.

INT: JADE'S APARTMENT--DAY

CAMERA MOVES IN ON a young man sitting at the edge of a sofa

bed.

CLOSE UP--HIS SMALL HANDS

WE SEE him counting his money.  This isn't any ordinary

counting of money, he's straightening out all the corners of

the bills, arranging them so the bills--actually the "dead

presidents"--are facing the same way.  This is MOOKIE.  Once

he's finished with that task, counting his money, he sneaks

into his sister's bedroom.

INT: JADE'S BEDROOM--DAY

CLOSE UP--JADE

JADE, Mookie's sister, is fast asleep.  Mookie's fingers

ENTER THE FRAME and start to play with her lips.  Jade

pushes his hands away.  Mookie waits several beats and he

continues.  Jade wakes up--mad.

He plants a big fat juicy on his sister's forehead.

EXT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--DAY

A 1975 El Dorado pulls up in front of the neighborhood

pizzeria--Sal's Famous Pizzeria.

From out of the car comes the owner, SAL, a slightly

overweight man in his early fifties, and his two sons, PINO,

22, and VITO, 20.  It's time for them to go to work at Sal's

Famous Pizzeria in the heart of Black Brooklyn.  Sal's sits

on the corner of The Block.  The Block being where this film

on the hottest day of the summer takes place.

Pino kicks a beer can in his path into the gutter.

Pino is now silent.  Sal walks over to him.

EXT: MOOKIE'S BROWNSTONE--DAY

Mookie comes down his stoop and walks to work.

EXT: STREET--DAY

The Block is beginning to come to life.  Those unlucky souls

who have to work this Saturday drag themselves to it, and

the kids are out on the street to play in the hot sun all

day long.

EXT: MOTHER SISTER'S STOOP--DAY

Mookie stops to say hello to MOTHER SISTER.  She leans out

her window on the parlor floor.  In the summertime, the only

time when she's not perched in her window is when she's

asleep.

INT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--DAY

Mookie enters the pizzeria and Pino is on him before the

door closes.

Pino looks at his father.  He wants to be backed up on this;

all he gets is an amused look, and a smirk from Vito.

There's a knock on the door and Da Mayor enters.

Sal looks at Pino, who reluctantly gives Da Mayor the broom.

Da Mayor almost runs out of the pizzeria in his hurry; soon

as he finishes he'll be able to get a bottle.

EXT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--DAY

Da Mayor sweeps the sidewalk, happy as can be.  As soon as

he finishes he can get that money and get that bottle.

EXT: STOOP--DAY

A group of youths sit on a stoop, waiting for someone.  They

are CEE, PUNCHY, and the lone female, ELLA.

Ella stands up and yells.

She looks up into his window, then sits down.

The door swings open at the top of the stoop and AHMAD

appears.

Ahmad sits down with them.

In the BG, we hear the dum-dum-dum of a giant box.  The

sound gets louder as the box gets closer.  The youths look

down the block and see a tall young man coming towards them.

He has a very distinct walk, it's more like a bop.  This is

RADIO RAHEEM.  The size of his box is tremendous and one has

to think, how does he carry something that big around with

him?  It must weigh a ton, and it seems like the sidewalk

shakes as the rap music blares out.  The song we hear is the

only one Radio Raheem plays.

MEDIUM SHOT--RADIO RAHEEM

Radio Raheem stops in front of the group, looks at them, and

turns down the volume.  It's quiet again.

Radio Raheem nods and turns up the volume.  Way up.

EXT: WE LOVE STOREFRONT--DAY

Radio Raheem waves to Mister Senor Love Daddy as he walks by.

INT: WE LOVE CONTROL BOOTH--DAY

Mister Senor Love Daddy gives Radio Raheem a clenched-fist

salute.

EXT: FRUIT-N-VEG DELIGHT--DAY

Da Mayor walks into a newly opened fruit and vegetable deli

stand that is owned by Koreans.

INT: FRUIT-N-VEG DELIGHT--DAY

Da Mayor is looking for his beer in the refrigerated cases,

his ice-cold beer.

EXT: MOTHER SISTER'S STOOP--DAY

Da Mayor has his can of beer (not Budweiser) and the brown

paper bag is twisted into a knot at the bottom.  He stops

and takes a long swig.

Da Mayor lowers the can from his mouth and looks up at his

heckler.  It's obvious from the look on his face he's heard

this before.  Da Mayor contorts his face and stares at her.

Da Mayor changes his face into a more grotesque look.

Da Mayor tips his beat-up hat to Mother Sister and takes a

final swig of beer just for her.

INT: TINA'S APARTMENT--DAY

An elderly Puerto Rican woman, CARMEN, is telling off her

daughter TINA in Spanish.  Tina, having heard enough, closes

the door on her mother's ranting and raving.

ANGLE--TINA

Tina bends down and scoops her baby son HECTOR up from the

bed and holds him for dear life to her breasts.  She talks

to her son while walking around the room.

Tina kisses her son.  Tina is seventeen years old, another

teenage parent.

EXT: STREET CORNER--DAY

Every day on this corner, summer or winter, spring or fall,

a small group of men meet.  They have no steady employment,

nothing they can speak of; they do, however, have the gift

of gab.  These man can talk, talk, and mo' talk, and when a

bottle is going round and they're feeling "nice," they get

philosophical.  These men become the great thinkers of the

world, with solutions to all its ills; like drugs, the

homeless, and AIDS.  They're called the Corner Men: SWEET

DICK WILLIE, COCONUT SID, and ML.  All three are sitting in

folding chairs up against a wall in the shade.

INT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--DAY

Customers are in Sal's; it's lunchtime and it's fairly busy.

Sal puts a hot slice down on the counter in front of BUGGIN'

OUT, a b-boy.

Buggin' Out looks at the slice.

Buggin' Out slams his money down on the counter, takes his

slice and sits down.

ANGLE--TABLE

All around Buggin' Out, peering down from the WALL OF FAME,

are signed, framed, eight by ten glossies of famous Italian

Americans.  WE SEE Joe DiMaggio, Rocky Marciano, Perry Como,

Frank Sinatra, Luciano Pavarotti, Liza Minnelli, Governor

Mario Cuomo, Al Pacino and, of course, how can we forget

Sylvester Stallone as Rocky Balboa: THE ITALIAN STALLION,

also RAMBO.

ANGLE--DOOR

A young Puerto Rican woman opens the door.

Mookie hands her the pizza.

Nilda hands him a handful of singles.  Mookie looks at the

crumpled mess.  Nilda attempts to close the door, but

Mookie's foot says, "Hell no."

First he straightens out the dollars, then counts the bills.

Nilda looks at him and sees right away he's not going

anywhere.

Nilda goes into the apartment and we hear her talking in

Spanish to a male.

ANGLE--MOOKIE

Mookie bends down to tie his sneakers.

ANGLE--DOOR

Nilda reappears and holds out a lonely lone dollar for him.

Mookie has her hold it out for awhile, then he takes it.

Nilda slams the door.

EXT: MOTHER SISTER'S STOOP--DAY

Jade sits down next to Mother Sister on the stoop.

Mother Sister hands her a bag that is at her side.

Jade unwraps a head scarf from around Mother Sister's head

and a full head of long black hair falls to her shoulders.

Jade begins to part, grease, and comb out Mother Sister's

hair.

Da Mayor stands in front of the stoop, he's smiling for days.

X CLOSE UP--THE WHITE-HOT SUN

HOT, HOTTER AND HOTTEST MONTAGE

Right now, folks, we're gonna suspend the narrative and show

how people are coping with the oppressive heat.

People are taking cold showers.

Sticking faces in ice-cold, water-filled sinks.

Heads stuck in refrigerators.

A wife tells her husband, "Hell no, I'm not cooking.  It's

too hot.  The kitchen is closed."

Men downing six-packs of ice-cold brew.

Faces stuck directly in front of fans.

A young kid cracks an egg on Sal's Cadillac.  The moment the

egg hits the car hood it starts to cook.  The kid looks

directly INTO THE CAMERA and smiles, then looks up to see

Sal, mad as a motherfucker, chasing after him.

And how can I forget the papers, the newspaper headlines.

EXT: STREET--DAY

CLOSE UP--JOHNNY PUMP

POW!  A powerful gush of water flies out RIGHT AT THE CAMERA.

Ahmad has just turned on the johnny pump and the white

stream of water flies across the street.

This attracts all the people of the block.  It's a chance to

cool off and momentarily beat the killer heat.

ANGLE--CEE AND PUNCHY

They both scrape beer cans on the sidewalk.

ANGLE--ELLA

She stands with caution away from the fire hydrant.  Ella

does not want to get wet.

ANGLE--CEE AND PUNCHY

They're still scraping away.

ANGLE--STREET

Folks, young and old, begin to get in the water and play.

ANGLE--CEE AND PUNCHY

Both now have cans with the ends scraped away, and go to the

johnny pump.  Punchy bends down behind the hydrant and

places the can over the water.  The can now directs the

water into giant streams.

ANGLE--ELLA

Ahmad sneaks up behind Ella and picks her up.  She's kicking

and screaming furiously.

Ahmad is not having it.  He carries a kicking Ella into the

middle of the street in direct line of fire.

They both are hit with a blast of water and are soaked to

the bone.  Ella starts to punch Ahmad, and chases after him.

ANGLE--STREET

We hear the familiar rap music of Radio Raheem's box.

CLOSE--RADIO RAHEEM

Radio Raheem is too cool.  By the way he's dressed, it could

be fall, not the hottest day of the year.  But you could

never tell it from him.  He's too cool.

CLOSE--RADIO RAHEEM

Raheem looks at Cee, he wants to get by and he doesn't want

to get wet either.  And if his box gets wet, somebody is

gonna die.  Cee knows this too.

ANGLE--JOHNNY PUMP

Cee stands in front of the hydrant, blocking the water so

Radio Raheem can pass.

ANGLE--RADIO RAHEEM

He slowly bops across the street as all eyes watch.  When

he's clear, Cee moves and the water gushes out again as

folks play.

ANGLE--STREET

We hear a car horn blowing.  People move out of the way as

the vehicle speeds through the spray.

An older man, CHARLIE, stops his white convertible and blows

his horn.

CLOSE--CHARLIE

CLOSE--CEE AND PUNCHY

ANGLE--STREET

The people all move to the car, for they know what is about

to happen.

ANGLE--HYDRANT

Cee and Punchy leap off the hydrant, unleashing a jet blast

that flies directly into Charlie's car.  The whole block is

dying.

ANGLE--STREET

Charlie pulls his flooded car over to the curb, jumps out,

and runs to get hold of Cee and Punchy.  Of course, he's

slow, as the kids turn into track stars and make like Carl

Lewis.

ANGLE--STREET

Charlie, a wet mess, tries to buy some sympathy from the

folks; none is to be bought.

The ranting continues, and people laugh at him.

A cop car screeches to a halt in front of the man.  Two

officers, LONG and PONTE, get out.

Officer Long goes into his car and gets a wrench.

ANGLE--JOHNNY PUMP

Officer Long turns off the hydrant, then puts the cap back on.

Officer Long sides up to Da Mayor who's been looking on.

Da Mayor is quiet.

Officer Ponte goes to Da Mayor's other side.

Mookie emerges from the crowd and leads Da Mayor away from

the interrogation.

The man looks at the crowd of Blacks and Puerto Ricans

around him and he considers what he just heard.

Both cops laugh.

ANGLE--STREET

Charlie drives away, fuming.

...then cues up the record.

EXT: STREET--DAY

On a stoop, a group of Puerto Ricans sits talking, drinking

cerveza frio, and playing dominoes.  One of their cars is

parked near the stoop, and blasts salsa music.

ANGLE--RADIO RAHEEM

As usual we hear the rap music of Radio Raheem, but

underneath the salsa music.  Radio Raheem does not like to

be bested; the salsa music from the parked car is giving him

competition, this is no good.  Radio Raheem stands in front

of the stoop and raises his decibel level.

ANGLE--STOOP

The Puerto Rican men look at him, then begin to yell at him

in Spanish.  There is a standoff, the rap and salsa clashing

in a deafening roar.  One of the men, STEVIE, gets off the

stoop and goes to the car.

ANGLE--CAR

Stevie turns the car radio off.

CLOSE--RADIO RAHEEM

Radio Raheem smiles, nods, turns his box to a reasonable

listening level, and bops down the block.  Radio Raheem

still the loudest.  Radio Raheem still the king.

ANGLE--STOOP

The men curse in Spanish and shake their heads in

bewilderment and Stevie turns the salsa back on.

Jordans.

ANGLE--BUGGIN' OUT

He runs down the block after Clifton.

This commotion has attracted a crowd, including Ahmad, Cee,

Punchy, and Ella.

HERE WE GO!

The crowd likes that one and they laugh and egg him on.

AWWW SHIT!  Why did he get Buggin' started?

Buggin' Out looks down at his marred Air Jordans.  The

crowd, smelling blood, wants to see some.

The crowd gives their approval.

INT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--DAY

Mookie and Vito enter the shop.

Vito stands frozen in front of his brother.

woman, the one he's been on the phone with earlier.  We've

heard the voice and now SEE the person.

Mookie pushes Tina back into her bedroom.

INT: TINA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

Mookie sits Tina down on her futon bed, turns off the

lights, and turns on WE LOVE RADIO as Mister Senor Love

Daddy serenades them with slow jams.

He laughs his sinister laugh.

ANGLE--MOOKIE AND TINA

Mookie unsnaps her bra, then pulls her panties off.  Tina is

naked as a jaybird.

He gets up.

INT: TINA'S KITCHEN

Mookie walks into the kitchen and sees CARMEN, Tina's

mother, fixing some food on the stove.

Carmen stares at him, it's a look that would definitely stop

traffic, she mutters some Spanish and goes into her bedroom,

slamming the door behind her.

ANGLE--MOOKIE

He opens the refrigerator and takes out all the trays of ice.

INT: TINA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT

Mookie sits down on the bed with a bowl filled with ice cubes.

CLOSE--TINA'S FOREHEAD

Mookie rubs an ice cube on her forehead.

CLOSE--TINA'S NECK

Mookie rubs an ice cube on her neck.

CLOSE--TINA'S LIPS

Mookie rubs an ice cube on her full moist lips, then puts it

in her mouth.

CLOSE--TINA'S THIGHS

He rubs an ice cube up and down her thighs.

CLOSE--TINA'S BUTTOCKS

He rubs an ice cube on her round, firm buttocks.

CLOSE--TINA'S BREAST

He rubs an ice cube on her breast.

Both Tina and Mookie are dying.  Mookie now has an ice cube

on the left and right nipples and WE SEE before our very own

eyes both get swollen, red, and erect.

CLOSE--TINA'S MOUTH

Mookie kisses her.

INT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--NIGHT

Officers Ponte and Long are awaiting their orders.

Sal goes over to the oven, takes out their food and wraps it

up.

The officers leave just as Mookie enters.

While Sal laughs at his corny joke, Pino pulls Vito into the

back.

INT: STOREROOM--NIGHT

HOT CITY NIGHT MONTAGE

THE BLOCK.  WE'VE SEEN it at daytime, but now WE SEE it at

night.  Even though the white-hot sun is gone, nonetheless

the heat is still stifling.  And in a peculiar, funny sort

of way, it's worse.  You expect it to be hot during the

light of day when the sun is beating down on the cement and

tar, but at night it should be considerably cooler; well,

not tonight, it's hot.  All the residents of The Block: the

Corner Men, Mother Sister, Da Mayor, Jade, etc., all the

people WE'VE SEEN throughout the day are now coping with the

night-time heat, plus it's humid as shit.  Everyone is

outside, sitting on stoops, on cars and you know the kids

are playing, running up and down the block.  Now it's the

hottest night of the year.

EXT: STREET--NIGHT

Buggin' Out sits down on a car next to Radio Raheem; as

usual, his box is blasting.

INT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--NIGHT

Vito, Pino and Mookie are cleaning up.

Sal is looking into the cash register.

ANGLE--VITO, PINO, AND MOOKIE

All three look at each other.  The horror is on their faces,

with the prospect of working, slaving in Sal's and Sons

Famous Pizzeria, trapped for the rest of their lives.  Is

this their future?  It's a frightening thought.

ANGLE--DOOR

Ahmad, Cee, Punchy, and Ella enter.

Mookie goes over to the table where Ahmad, Cee, Punchy, and

Ella sit.

OH NO!  We hear the dum-dum-dum of Radio Raheem's box.  As

everyone turns their heads to the door, Buggin' Out and

Radio Raheem are inside already.  We have never heard the

rap music as loud as it is now.  You have to scream to be

heard and that's what they do.

Ahmad, Cee, Punchy, and Ella start to dance while Mookie

takes a seat, the impartial observer that he is.

Sal grabs his Mickey Mantle bat from underneath the counter

and brings it down on Radio Raheem's box, again and again

and again.  The music stops.

CLOSE--RADIO RAHEEM'S BOX

Radio Raheem's pride and joy is smashed to smithereens.

It's going to the junkyard quick.

ANGLE--PIZZERIA

There is an eerie quiet as everyone is frozen, surprised by

the suddenness of Sal's action, the swings of his Mickey

Mantle bat.  All look at Radio Raheem and realize what is

about to happen.

ANGLE--RADIO RAHEEM

Radio Raheem screams, he goes crazy.

Radio Raheem picks Sal up from behind the counter and starts

to choke his ass.  Radio Raheem's prized possession--his

box, the only thing he owned of value--his box, the one

thing that gave him any sense of worth--has been smashed to

bits. (Radio Raheem, like many Black youth, is the victim of

materialism and a misplaced sense of values.) Now he doesn't

give a fuck anymore.  He's gonna make Sal pay with his life.

Vito and Pino jump on Radio Raheem, who only tightens his

grip around Sal's neck.  Buggin' Out tries to help his

friend.  Mookie just stands and watches as Ahmad, Cee,

Punchy, and Ella cheerlead.

EXT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--NIGHT

The tangled mass of choking, biting, kicking, screaming

confusion flies through the door of Sal's out onto the

sidewalk.

CLOSE--EDDIE

The kid yells:

CLOSE--DA MAYOR

He looks up.

CLOSE--MOTHER SISTER

She looks up.

CLOSE--SWEET DICK WILLIE

He also looks up.

ANGLE--STREET

The people on The Block run to Sal's Famous Pizzeria to see

the STATIC.

ANGLE--SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA

Radio Raheem, Buggin' Out, Sal, Vito, and Pino are still

entangled, rolling around on the sidewalk, but now before an

entertained crowd of onlookers:

ANGLE--DA MAYOR

The fight continues.  Da Mayor is smart enough not to get in

the middle of this war.  We hear sirens, somebody has called

DA COPS.

ANGLE--STREET

The cop cars come right through the crowd, almost running

over some people.  The cops get out with nightsticks and

guns drawn.  WE RECOGNIZE two of the faces, Officers Long

and Ponte.  Any time there is a skirmish between a Black man

and a white man, you can bet the house on who the copes are

gonna go for.  You know the deal!  Buggin' Out is pulled off

first, then Vito and Pino, but Radio Raheem is a crazed man.

It takes all six cops to pull him off Sal, who is red as a

beet from being choked.

ANGLE--COPS

Handcuffs are put on Buggin' Out as he watches the other

cops put a choke hold on Radio Raheem to restrain him.

ANGLE--RADIO RAHEEM

Radio Raheem is still struggling, then he just stops, his

body goes limp and he falls to the sidewalk like a fifty-

pound bag of Idaho potatoes.

ANGLE--STREET

Officers Long and Ponte kick him.

Radio Raheem just lies there like a bump on a log.

ANGLE--CROWD

The crowd stares at Radio Raheem's still body.  He's

unconscious or dead.

CLOSE--OFFICER LONG

ANGLE--STREET

The officers all look at each other.  They know, they know

exactly what they've done.  The infamous Michael Stewart

choke hold.

The officers pick up Radio Raheem's limp body and throw him

into the back seat.  Buggin' Out is pushed into another car.

The cop cars speed off; in their haste to beat it, they have

left the crowd.  It's at this point the crowd becomes an

angry mob.

ANGLE--MOB

The mob looks at...

ANGLE--MOB POV

Sal still on the sidewalk, being helped to his feet by Vito

and Pino, who are in bad shape themselves.

ANGLE--MOB

The mood/tone of the mob is getting ugly.  Once again they

have seen one of their own killed before their eyes at the

hands of the cops.  We hear the murmurs of the folks go

through the crowd.

The cops, in their haste to get Radio Raheem out of there,

have left an angry mob of Black folks with a defenseless

Sal, Vito, and Pino.

The mob looks at them.

HIGH ANGLE

Mookie looks at the crowd and notices he's on the wrong side.

He leaves Sal and his two sons.

ANGLE--STREET

Da Mayor walks in front of the crowd.

ANGLE--STREET

Mookie picks up a garbage can and dumps it out into the

street.  He walks through the crowd, up to Da Mayor, Sal,

Vito, and Pino.

CLOSE--MOOKIE

He screams.

SLOW MOTION

Mookie hurls the garbage can through the plate glass window

of Sal's Famous Pizzeria.  That's it.  All hell breaks loose.

The dam has been unplugged, broke.  The rage of a people has

been unleashed, a fury.  A lone garbage can thrown through

the air has released a tidal wave of frustration.

ANGLE--STREET

Da Mayor pushes Sal, Vito, and Pino out of the way as the

mob storms into Sal's Famous Pizzeria.

INT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--NIGHT

The people rush into Sal's Famous Pizzeria, tearing it up.

CLOSE--CASH REGISTER

The cash register is opened.  WE SEE only coins, Sal has the

paper.

EXT: DA MAYOR'S STOOP--NIGHT

Da Mayor leads Sal, Vito, and Pino back to his stoop where

they watch in horror.

INT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--NIGHT

Someone lights a match.  WHOOOSH!

EXT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--NIGHT

Sal's Famous Pizzeria is going up in flames and now it's a

carnival.

One might have thought that the elders--who through the

years have been broken down, whipped, their spirits crushed,

beaten into submission--would be docile, strictly onlookers.

That's not true except for Da Mayor.  The rest of the elders

are right up in it with the young people.

INT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--NIGHT

CLOSE--PHOTOS ON WALL OF FAME

The photos of famous Italian-Americans are burning.

EXT: FRUIT-N-VEG DELIGHT--NIGHT

The mob now moves across the street in front of the Korean

fruit and vegetable stand.  Sweet Dick Willie, Coconut Sid,

and ML stand at the head of the mob.

CLOSE--KOREAN CLERK

He's scared to death, as the mob is poised to tear his place

up too.  The clerk wildly swings a broom to hold them off.

CLOSE--ML

The mob starts to laugh; they feel for him.

ANGLE--MOB

EXT: DA MAYOR'S STOOP--NIGHT

Sal, Vito, and Pino look on as Sal's Famous Pizzeria goes up

in smoke.

CLOSE--VITO

CLOSE--PINO

CLOSE--SAL

EXT: STREET--NIGHT

ANGLE--STREET

Jade is running through the mob, looking for her brother.

ANGLE--MOOKIE

Mookie is running around with the rest of the mob.

ANGLE--STREET

The wail of fire trucks and police sirens is now added to

the night.

EXT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--NIGHT

The mob moves back to in front of Sal's as the fire trucks

and police, in full riot gear, pull up in the street behind

them.

The firemen rush to hook up their hoses, the police force

themselves between the crowd and the burning Sal's Famous

Pizzeria.

The mob doesn't listen, they will not be moved.  The mob

will not be moved until they see Sal's Famous Pizzeria burn

to the ground.

ANGLE--SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA

The firemen douse the pizzeria, trying desperately to stop

the fire from spreading into the adjoining buildings.

CLOSE--MOOKIE

CLOSE--MOTHER SISTER

ANGLE--MOB

It will take force to move this mass of people.

POW!

The hoses are turned on the mob.

WE SEE Mookie, Mother Sister, Sweet Dick Willie, ML, Coconut

Sid, Jade, Ahmad, Cee, Punchy, and Ella, etc., go down

before the powerful blast of the firehouse.

Now we've come full circle.  We're back to Montgomery or

Birmingham, Alabama.  The only thing missing is Sheriff Bull

Connor and the German shepherds.

It would take force to move them and that's exactly what the

mob got.  People are trying to hold on to each other, cars,

railings, anything to keep from being swept away.

EXT: DA MAYOR'S STOOP--NIGHT

Da Mayor, Sal, Vito, and Pino watch in disbelief.  It's

unbelievable what is happening before their eyes.

THE STREET--NIGHT

THEIR POV

People are screaming, kids and women are not being spared

from the brute force of the firehoses either.

EXT: WE LOVE STOREFRONT--NIGHT

WE SEE the reflection of the fire in the storefront window

as Mister Senor Love Daddy looks on.

EXT: STREET--NIGHT

ANGLE--JADE AND MOTHER SISTER

Jade and Mother Sister try to hold on to a streetlamp as a

gush of water hits them; their grips loosens, the water is

too powerful, and they slide away down the block and Da

Mayor runs after them.

INT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--NIGHT

CLOSE--PHOTOS

Some burnt photos on the floor.

CLOSE--MICKEY MANTLE BAT

The Mickey Mantle bat burns.

CLOSE--RADIO RAHEEM'S BOX

Radio Raheem's box has melted into a black mass of goo.

CLOSER--RADIO RAHEEM'S BOX

As WE MOVE IN TIGHTER ON the melted box, we begin to hear

the rap song that we've hear throughout.  All other sound

drops as the rap song gets louder and louder until it's

deafening.

ANGLE--SMILEY

Smiley sits up from where he hid during the burning and

looting of Sal's Famous Pizzeria.  Smiley looks around and

goes directly to the smoldering Wall of Fame.  He stands

there.  Smiley pins one of his Malcolm X/Martin Luther King,

Jr., cards to the Wall of Fame.

CLOSE--PHOTO

CLOSE--SMILEY

We're on Smiley's face and a smile slowly travels across.

It's the first time Smiley has smiled in years and nobody is

there to see this event.

FADE TO BLACK

THE MORNING AFTER

FADE IN:

EXT: THE STREET--TO INT: RADIO STATION STOREFRONT--DAY

The CAMERA, FROM HIGH ABOVE, CRANES DOWN ON The Block.  The

sidewalk is deserted, broken glass is everywhere, and it

looks exactly as how one expects it to look, the morning

after an uprising.

The CAMERA NOW MOVES IN ON the WE LOVE storefront where

Mister Senor Love Daddy is in his familiar place behind the

mike.

CLOSE--MISTER SENOR LOVE DADDY

CLOSER--MISTER SENOR LOVE DADDY

He screams:

INT: TINA'S BEDROOM--DAY

Mookie jumps out of her bed; Tina sleeps by his side and

their son Hector is between them.

Mookie is putting on his clothes.

Mookie leaves.

MOTHER SISTER'S BEDROOM--DAY

Da Mayor wakes up in Mother Sister's big brass bed (she was

born in it).  At first he has no idea where he's at, then

sees Mother Sister sitting down across the room smiling at

him.

Da Mayor gets up out of her big brass bed.

Da Mayor and Mother Sister both look out the parlor window

to see THE BLOCK and Mookie.

EXT: SAL'S FAMOUS PIZZERIA--DAY

Mookie walks up to Sal's Famous Pizzeria as it still

smoulders in the morning light.  Sal emerges from the

wreckage; he looks like he might have slept there.

Sal looks at Mookie in disbelief.

Sal has had it.

Sal pulls out a wad and quickly peels off hundred dollar

bills.

Sal throws the "C" notes at Mookie, they hit him in the

chest and fall to the sidewalk.

Mookie is stunned by Sal's outburst.  He picks up the bills.

Both look at the two hundred-dollar bills on the sidewalk

and refuse to pick them up.  It's a stalemate.

Mookie counts his money.

Mookie turns around and goes back.

Mookie thinks about it, looks at the two "C" notes still

smiling up at him.  He quickly scoops them up.

EXT: STREET--DAY

HIGH ANGLE

As Mookie turns and walks away, Sal goes back into Sal's

Famous Pizzeria to salvage what is salvageable, and The

Block begins to awake from its slumber, ready to deal once

again with the heat of the hottest day of the year.
