FADE IN:

INT./EXT. A CAR (MOVING). NIGHT

The shifting lights from the odd passing car play over the

faces of MR. and MRS. PRESCOTT, a pleasant-looking couple in

their late thirties, dressed up for a night out. Mr. Prescott

drives them along a dark hilly two-lane highway.

Pause.

UP AHEAD, near the top of the oncoming hill, a RED PICKUP

TRUCK is poking its nose out of the short exit lane.

The PICKUP LURCHES into the road, with not nearly enough

time to spare.

Mr. Prescott swerves OVER the DOUBLE SOLID WHITE LINE and

clears the truck as --

Another pair of HEADLIGHTS from an oncoming truck RISES UP

over the HILL directly in FRONT of them --

Mr. Prescott's FOOT STOMPS on the BRAKE. We BLACK OUT and

there is the SOUND of a terrible CRASH.

EXT. THE PRESCOTTS' FRONT DOOR. NIGHT

The SHADOW of a big man looms up onto the front door. A big

finger RINGS the BELL.

A moment.

AMY, a thirteen-year-old baby-sitter with braces, opens the

door and looks up. In the b.g. we see TWO CHILDREN, SAMMY

(Samantha) and TERRY PRESCOTT, in their pajamas, lying on

their stomachs in the living room, watching television. Sammy

is eleven. Terry is eight.

REVERSE: DARRYL, the SHERIFF, a portly fellow with glasses

and a mustache, looks down at AMY.

AMY closes the door and looks expectantly up at Darryl. Darryl

doesn't know how to start.

EXT. CHURCH. DAY

CREDITS BEGIN OVER a blustery April day. The steeple of the

little white church stands out against the sharp blue sky.

INT. TOWN CHURCH. DAY

It's a small church and a small congregation, but it's full.

There's a CHOIR of mostly SENIOR CITIZENS arrayed in the

back. TWO CLOSED CASKETS are laid out in front of the

MINISTER, a fiftyish woman with thick glasses and salt-and-

pepper hair, who is giving a eulogy MOS.

Among the mourners in the second row sit Terry and Sammy,

both redeyed, and uncomfortable in their dress-up clothes.

Their Aunt Ruth, a pinch-faced woman in her forties, sits

next to them.

Sammy and Terry are holding hands tightly. Terry wipes his

eyes with his free hand.

The Minister addresses her remarks to the children. Sammy is

hanging on the Minister's every word; Terry is shifting his

eyes and his seat as if it will kill him to sit still another

minute.

EXT. SCOTTSVILLE CEMETERY. SIXTEEN YEARS LATER. DAY

On the beautiful hill overlooking the beautiful windy green

country, SAMMY, twenty-seven years old now, puts flowers on

her parents' graves with quick, practiced movements.

She is a nice-looking young woman of a neat appearance, saved

from primness by an elusive, pleasantly flustered quality.

An unsuccessfully neat person. She is dressed in office

clothes -- white blouse, dark skirt, high heels, light

raincoat over everything. She picks out a couple of weeds

and then bows her head and closes her eyes.

CREDITS END.

EXT. SCOTTSVILLE -- MAIN STREET. DAY

Scottsville is a small town. Main Street. Run-down old stores

next to a new bank, a couple of chain stores, a few

restaurants of varying ambitions. Civil War statue. World

War I statue. World War II statue. Residential streets

wandering away from Main Street up and down hills. You know

there's a minimall somewhere nearby. A fair amount of activity

during the daytime.

SAMMY'S CAR pulls up across the street from where an eight-

year-old BOY in a secondhand baseball jacket and a school

knapsack is waiting at the curb. This is her son, RUDY. SAMMY

calls out the car window.

Rudy hurries across the street and gets in the car, slinging

his knapsack into the backseat.

INT. THE CAR (MOVING). DAY

INT./EXT. CAR/CAROL'S HOUSE. DAY

Sammy stops the car outside a heavily THICKETED DRIVEWAY

(CAROL'S HOUSE), and RUDY gets out.

Rudy returns to take his knapsack out of the back.

Rudy hoists his knapsack out of the back.

Rudy gives her a kiss and puts his arms around her and

squeezes her neck.

He withdraws, slams the door. As Sammy DRIVES AWAY, he slogs

up the long twisting driveway.

EXT. MERCHANTS NATIONAL TRUST -- PARKING LOT. DAY

Sammy gets out of her car, which is parked in one of the

half dozen spaces in the little parking lot allocated for

bank employees.

She hurries toward the employees' entrance, fixing her skirt

as she goes.

INT. MERCHANTS NATIONAL TRUST. DAY

Sammy hurries down the clean hallway in the back past MABEL,

a pleasant-faced fellow employee.

Mabel nods and passes by.

SAMMY KNOCKS on a big door that says "Manager" and has half

the letters of the previous branch manager's name taken off

it.

Sammy swings open the door. BRIAN EVERETT, the new branch

manager, is unpacking a box. Sammy is surprised to see he is

in his early thirties and very good-looking in a boyish sort

of way; he wears shirt-sleeves and tie, and a wedding ring.

Sammy comes into the office and sits.

Sammy gets up and closes the door.

INT. BRIAN'S OFFICE. LATER

Sammy sits in front of Brian's desk. Brian is behind the

desk listening.

Brian kicks back in his chair and puts his hands behind his

head.

INT. SAMMY'S CAR (MOVING). DUSK

Sammy and Rudy drive home in silence. The orange sunlight

flickers through the trees and onto their faces as they drive

along.

EXT. PRESCOTT (SAMMY'S) HOUSE. DUSK

The same house that Sammy grew up in, with sixteen years'

more wear on it.

Sammy's car swings expertly by the mailbox, and Rudy reaches

half his body out of the passenger window and gets the mail.

INT. SAMMY'S HOUSE. DUSK

Sammy comes into the house carrying two bags of groceries.

Rudy follows, looking through the mail. Sammy passes through

the house and goes into the kitchen.

Her whole face lights up and she grabs the letter. She tears

it open and reads it with growing excitement.

INT. SAMMY'S BEDROOM. LATER

Sammy opens her FILE DRAWER. Inside are tax files, household

files, miscellaneous files.

She puts Terry's letter away in a very full file marked "Terry --

Correspondence." The folder is stuffed with other letters,

on all different kinds of stationery from all over the

country, all from Terry.

INT. DINING ROOM. NIGHT

Sammy and Rudy are eating dinner. It's a biggish house for

just two people.

Rudy looks worried and doesn't answer.

INT. LIVING ROOM. LATER

Rudy is on the floor, writing in his school composition

notebook. Sammy comes downstairs.

She puts on a CD, sits down and picks up a book. She looks

at Rudy, who is writing away.

Pause.

Rudy keeps writing.

INT. LIVING ROOM. LATER

Sammy is smoking a cigarette and drinking a glass of wine

and reading Rudy's story. It upsets her.

INT. SAMMY'S BEDROOM. LATER

Sammy sits on the edge of her bed, not dialing the phone.

She catches a glimpse of herself in her parents' floor-length

mirror with the worn, heavy wooden frame. Against her better

judgment she picks up the phone and dials.

INT. DAWSON'S GRILL. NIGHT

Sammy and BOB STEEGERSON are eating dinner at Dawson's, the

only fancy restaurant in town. Bob is in his mid-thirties, a

Realtor, a decent, ordinary guy.

He is smiling at her.

Bob drains his wineglass. Sammy cuts at her steak.

INT. BOB'S BEDROOM. NIGHT

Sammy and Bob lie in Bob's bed, a few minutes after having

made love. They are very far away from each other, but trying

with difficulty not to let on.

She kisses him. She tries to make it sexy, but he's not into

it anymore and he politely restricts the kissing.

INT. SAMMY'S BATHROOM. NIGHT

Sammy stands in her slip brushing her teeth in front of the

mirror. She brushes vigorously, looking at herself while she

brushes.

EXT. STREET CORNER -- WORCESTER, MASS. DAWN

The corner window of a grim little apartment building on a

very grim street in a grim little city.

INT. TERRY'S APARTMENT -- WORCESTER, MASS. NIGHT

A tiny apartment with a bed, chair, table, fridge, and not

much else. One window has a broken pane and an old sheet

neatly thumbtacked over it to keep the wind out.

TERRY PRESCOTT comes in. He is twenty-five years old: a real

mess with a certain natural appeal. He wears old jeans, very

old hiking boots, and a lumberjack-style coat. He takes a

wool hat off his head. His hair is longish and dirty.

SHEILA SADLER is sitting at the table by the fridge. She is

barely eighteen, frail and damaged.

Terry looks at her and smiles encouragingly. She smiles back.

Sheila looks away. Silence.

As she opens her purse, Terry takes a few vague steps toward

her. She takes out a tiny hippie-ish woven wallet and gives

Terry all the money in it: a twenty and two ones.

Pause.

She puts her arms around him and holds on.

EXT. NEW YORK STATE -- MOUNTAINS -- HIGHWAY. DAY

Wide open shot of hilly country and a big sky overhead. A

GREYHOUND BUS drives into the shot along the curve of the

highway.

INT. BUS (MOVING) -- BATHROOM. DAY

Terry is seated on the toilet seat in the cramped bathroom

smoking a joint. He takes a huge hit and holds it in for as

long as humanly possible. He blows out what's left, takes

another equally huge hit and holds it in.

EXT. LOCAL HIGHWAY. DAY

The BUS WHOOSHES along a smaller, heavily wooded roller-

coaster road.

INT. BUS (MOVING). DAY

Terry looks out the window at the passing scenery. The

sunlight flickers on his face.

POV TERRY: The bus rolls past the hilltop cemetery.

Terry shifts uncomfortably in his seat.

POV TERRY: THE "WELCOME TO SCOTTSVILLE" SIGN whizzes by.

Houses start dotting the side of the road.

Terry starts getting very agitated.

EXT. MAIN STREET. DAY

Terry stands at one end of Main Street, backpack over his

shoulder, as the BUS DRIVES OFF. He looks around at the town

going about its Saturday afternoon business.

INT. KITCHEN. SIMULTANEOUS

Loud country-western music is blaring as Sammy, wearing an

apron, sets a big vase of flowers on the kitchen table and

hurries to the oven. There are also cookies, a pie, evidence

of massive fancy cooking. She puts on her oven mitts and

takes a lasagna out of the oven, as the phone rings. She

picks up.

EXT. SAMMY'S HOUSE. DAY

Sammy practically bursts out the front door. She has changed

into nice clothes.

EXT. ALLEY. DAY

Terry secrets himself in a small dark alley. He takes out

his carefully wrapped half joint and lights it. SMOKING, he

looks at the sunlit slant of street beyond the alley.

EXT. MAIN STREET. A FEW MOMENTS LATER

Terry, fairly well stoned, walks along Main Street. A skinny

man emerges from his hardware store to greet Terry and shake

hands. Terry says "Hi," but keeps on walking. He passes some

other people.

He almost runs right into SHERIFF DARRYL, sixteen years fatter

and grayer.

The Sheriff recognizes Terry and breaks into a big smile.

The Sheriff gives Terry a big bear hug. Terry is wasted and

selfconscious but smiling. He pats the Sheriff's back.

EXT. MAIN STREET. A FEW MOMENTS LATER

The Sheriff walks along with Terry. Terry, very self-conscious

about smelling like pot, fumbles to light a cigarette. The

Sheriff does not seem to notice.

They stop outside Dawson's.

Darryl walks away. Terry stands outside the restaurant looking

for Sammy.

Behind him in the restaurant Sammy is sitting at a table,

talking to the waitress.

She sees Terry and gets up immediately, smiling like crazy

as she threads her way through the tables toward the door.

Terry turns and sees her. He breaks into a big smile, tosses

his cigarette and goes into the restaurant. Through the window

we see them make their way toward each other.

Sammy throws her arms around him. He hugs her back with a

big involuntary smile as the GLASS DOOR slowly CLOSES.

INT. DAWSON'S -- AT THEIR TABLE. A FEW MOMENTS LATER

Terry is studying the menu, over-intently. Sammy is beaming

at him.

He gestures to his shitty clothes.

He looks around the restaurant.

He twists around and looks all over the restaurant. She

watches him.

He laughs. Looks down. Silence. He looks up at her.

A couple of people in the restaurant look at them. Terry

notices but Sammy does not.

The patrons are all either looking at them or trying not to

look. Silence.

Silence, except for the sounds of the restaurant.

The WAITRESS approaches with their salads.

She sets them down on the table.

SAMMY and TERRY Thank you.

The WAITRESS leaves. Silence. Terry picks at his salad. Sammy

doesn't touch hers. She watches him miserably.

EXT. BANK -- ATM. DAY

Terry watches while Sammy inserts her card in the ATM and

punches in her code. Terry waits. She punches in $300. The

machine grinds out her cash. She gives him the money.

She takes her card back and puts it back in her wallet.

INT. SAMMY'S CAR. DAY

Sammy and Terry get in the car. Sammy isn't saying anything.

She puts on her glasses and her seat belt. She won't look at

him.

She stops. Terry is now totally contrite.

INT. BATHROOM. NIGHT

Terry sits in the tub. Water drips from the faucet. He is

staring blankly up at the pristine blue-and-white tiled wall

and the neatly folded matching towels.

INT. LIVING ROOM. LATER

Sammy and Rudy are in the living room. Rudy is playing with

a Game Boy type game. In the b.g., TERRY is dialing the PHONE.

He looks clean and shaved, his hair is neatly combed.

He sits down.

CLICK. He is hung up on. He slowly HANGS UP.

Sammy notices that something's wrong. He looks at her from

across the room.

INT. TERRY'S ROOM. NIGHT

Terry is sitting on the bed, addressing an envelope to SHEILA.

He puts the $300 in the ENVELOPE and seals it. He sees Sammy

standing in the doorway. He starts to unlace his boots.

Sammy comes into the room and sits next to him. He is very

busy with his laces.

He starts crying. Sammy pats him.

EXT. SCOTTSVILLE CHURCH. DAY

A bright, clear, blue-skied Sunday morning in Scottsville.

Inside the little white church they're singing.

EXT. CHURCH. DAY

People are filing out of the church. We also see a couple of

the bank employees, including BRIAN and his very pretty six

months' PREGNANT wife, NANCY. We find SAMMY and RUDY. Sammy

is chatting to some neighbors. Rudy is bored out of his mind,

waiting for her.

INT. SAMMY'S HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM. DAY

Terry is lying on the sofa, smoking, with his feet up and

boots on, watching Sunday morning TV. On the coffee table

are his dirty ashtray, dirty bowl and spoon, Rice Krispies

box and a milk carton.

EXT. SAMMY'S HOUSE. NIGHT

Crickets buzz loudly outside the house.

INT. STAIRS. NIGHT

Sammy, in her bathrobe, comes down the stairs into the living

room. Terry is on the sofa playing with Rudy's Game Boy. He

barely looks up when she speaks to him.

Pause.

Terry tries to smile at her.

He goes back to his game. She hesitates, then heads back up

the stairs.

INT. SAMMY'S KITCHEN. DAY

Sammy, Terry and Rudy sit at the kitchen table. Sammy is

dressed for work. Rudy is dressed for school. Terry is also

fully dressed, drinking the last dregs of a mug of coffee.

He is tired, but listening to Sammy very carefully, as if

receiving difficult and critical instructions.

Terry glances at Rudy, then back at Sammy.

INT. BANK -- MABEL'S DESK. DAY

Sammy walks past MABEL'S DESK, carrying a big stack of files.

She drops three of them on the desk. MABEL is typing away at

her PC. The colors are a garish PURPLE background with GREEN

letters.

Sammy proceeds down the hall and into --

INT. BRIAN'S OFFICE. DAY

Brian is at his desk, busy working between stacks of papers.

She knocks on the open door.

Brian hesitates, shrugs and smiles.

Sammy looks at him with a blank smile.

INT. BANK -- SAMMY'S DESK. A MOMENT LATER

Sammy sits down at her desk and notices the time: 3:30. She

reaches for the phone, then decides not to call.

EXT. SCOTTSVILLE -- MAIN STREET. DAY

The CLOCK on the front of the TOWN HALL reads 3:31.

The SCHOOL BUS pulls up across from the town hall and

disgorges a handful of kids. Rudy comes out with his knapsack,

looking around...

POV RUDY: Terry, across the street, sits on the hood of

Sammy's car, smoking.

Rudy walks over to him.

INT. SAMMY'S CAR (MOVING). DAY

Terry and Rudy drive in silence. Terry glances at Rudy.

Rudy puts on his seat belt.

They drive in silence for a moment. Terry glances down at

Rudy.

INT. BANK -- SAMMY'S DESK. DAY

Sammy, laden with files, plops down at her desk as Mabel is

passing by. Mabel puts a phone message down in front of her.

A MOMENT LATER: Brian, talking to an employee, sees Sammy,

across the bank, hurrying out the employees' exit.

Sammy doesn't hear and exits.

EXT. ORRIN'S BACKYARD. DAY

Terry and Rudy are banging nails with RAY, a young guy Terry's

age. Terry, hammering with swift, accurate blows, glances up

and watches Rudy for a second. Rudy is hammering away with

no great skill.

He moves Rudy's hand down toward the end of the handle.

With two swift strokes he drives the nail flush into the

wood.

Terry looks at him unsympathetically for a moment.

He goes back to work. Rudy resumes hammering. After a moment

he switches his grip and starts hammering Terry's way. Terry

looks up and watches him.

EXT. IN FRONT OF ORRIN'S HOUSE. A MOMENT LATER

Sammy pulls up, fast, and gets out of the car. Hearing the

hammering from the backyard, she walks quickly around the

side of the house and stops short when she sees Rudy hammering

happily away with Terry and Ray.

She watches them working, unobserved, with mixed annoyance

and relief, and finally with quiet pleasure, because it's a

very cheerful sight.

INT. BANK. DAY

Half the staff has gone home. Sammy, in her coat, picks a

NOTE up off her CHAIR. It reads:

"SAMMY, PLEASE SEE ME A.S.A.P!!! -- BRIAN"

INT. BRIAN'S OFFICE. A MOMENT LATER

Sammy stands in front of Brian's desk.

Sammy closes the door.

INT. SAMMY'S BEDROOM. NIGHT

Sammy is asleep in bed.

INT. RUDY'S BEDROOM. NIGHT

Rudy is asleep in bed.

INT. BAR. NIGHT

Terry sits at the bar, drinking beer. There are a few locals

in the place, but it's pretty dead. He looks around; his

energy is too restless for the near-empty bar.

INT. RUDY'S BEDROOM. NIGHT

The DOOR OPENS, and TERRY COMES IN, smoking a cigarette.

He's plastered. He looks around the room. Looks at Rudy's

toys. Picks up some superhero comics and sits on Rudy's bed.

Then he spies Rudy's COMPOSITION BOOK, picks it up and starts

reading it.

Terry looks up. Rudy is half-sitting up in bed.

Rudy is very relieved. Terry keeps reading. Rudy watches

him.

Terry lies on his back and smokes.

INT. BANK -- SAMMY'S DESK. MORNING

There's a NOTE on Sammy's chair.

"SAMMY, PLEASE SEE ME -- BRIAN"

down at the note.

INT. BANK -- BRIAN'S OFFICE. DAY

Sammy listens to Brian.

Sammy looks at him blankly.

Mabel is typing angrily at a GRAY SCREEN with BLACK LETTERS.

Sammy walks by. Mabel is so mad she doesn't even look up.

INT. BANK -- SAMMY'S DESK. DAY

Sammy sits agitated for a moment. She makes a decision, picks

up the phone and dials.

INT. BOB'S OFFICE. SIMULTANEOUS

Bob is in his little realty office with two CLIENTS, a husband

and wife. He picks up his RINGING PHONE.

Sammy LAUGHS.

INT. SAMMY'S HOUSE -- DOWNSTAIRS HALL. NIGHT

Terry is holding a broom looking up at the ceiling. Sammy

passes by and stops.

Terry taps the broom handle against the ceiling.

He pokes again. A portion of the ceiling collapses on his

head in wet chunks of plaster and muck.

INT. SAMMY'S ROOM. NIGHT

Sammy, in front of the mirror, finishes dolling herself up

for her date. O.C. we hear loud banging. Sammy puts on her

earrings and goes into --

INT. HALL. CONTINUOUS

Sammy approaches RUDY and TERRY. They are bent over a big

nasty trench in the floorboard. There are wood shavings and

greasy pipe segments all over, and black smeary smudges on

the walls nearby.

Terry yanks the wrench and a SPRAY of FILTHY WATER comes out

of the pipe and splatters the wallpaper and pictures and

Sammy with gritty gray water. She looks at them.

INT. HALLWAY. NIGHT

Bob and Sammy -- cleaned up and wearing a different outfit --

are bustling out the front door. Terry stands by.

Sammy gets into her coat. Bob opens the front door.

Bob holds the door for Sammy and smiles at her. There is

some confusion about who should go out first. Finally she

goes and Bob follows. The atmosphere between them is fairly

awkward.

INT. SAMMY'S HOUSE. NIGHT

Terry and Rudy are watching TV from the sofa.

Terry looks at his watch.

He picks up the remote...

...and turns off the TV. They sit there in the sudden silence.

EXT. THE WILD MOOSE. NIGHT

The Wild Moose is a noisy roadside bar sitting under the

stars. Terry and Rudy get out of the car. Rudy looks

apprehensive.

Terry swings the door open.

INT. THE WILD MOOSE. NIGHT

POV RUDY: A lot of men and women at the bar or in booths,

eating and drinking. Smoky, crowded and very loud. As he

follows Terry through the crowd various patrons notice him --

some of the looks are friendly, some blank, some cold, i.e.,

what's a kid doing in here?

AT THE POOL TABLE: Terry and Rudy stand side by side facing

the players and waiting players gathered around the table.

Terry waves a few bills.

A MOMENT LATER: RUDY, very nervous, and the 1st Pool Player

are side by side shooting for break. Terry is behind Rudy

coaching him.

They hit the balls. Rudy just clips his ball and it doesn't

go anywhere. 1st Pool Player's ball hits the opposite bank

and comes almost all the way back.

Rudy doesn't answer. Terry winks at him.

A MOMENT LATER: 1ST POOL PLAYER BREAKS -- WHACK! -- The balls

scatter. Nothing drops. TERRY steps up to the table, chalking

up his cue.

QUICK CUTS: Of Terry running the table and everyone watching.

Three-ball in the side. One-ball in the corner. Nine-ball

off three cushions and into the corner, and the eleven-ball

into the side. Rudy watches him.

INT. BOB'S APARTMENT. NIGHT

Bob and Sammy sit at Bob's dining room table. The little

bachelor apartment looks pretty good. Tablecloth, candles,

wine, everything. Bob has just dropped a huge bombshell.

INT. WILD MOOSE. NIGHT

Terry has sunk everything but the eight ball. He leans over

to sink it. It's a fairly easy shot. He lines it up carefully,

and deliberately shoots it so it stops two inches from the

corner pocket.

A FEW MOMENTS LATER: Terry and Rudy sit side by side watching

as the 2nd Pool Player passes back and forth between them

and the camera, running the table. "Oohs" and "All rights"

emit from the spectators.

Sudden silence. Then the clack of the balls connecting. A

great common GROAN goes up. RUDY looks up at Terry.

Rudy looks at the TABLE: The eight-ball is two inches off

the corner. The cue ball is a few inches away from it. A

piece of cake, for an adult. Rudy looks deeply unconfident.

He gets up and tries to line up the eight-ball. Terry is

right next to him.

A long moment.

Everyone is relatively quiet. Rudy takes a few practice

strokes and then hits the cue ball, straight, but too softly.

It crawls toward the eight and taps it toward the corner,

slower and slower, hangs there, and DROPS.

A GENERAL "HEYYY!" GOES UP and everyone claps and cheers.

Terry grabs Rudy. Rudy smiles, ecstatic.

AT THE BAR: Darryl the SHERIFF, in his civvies, drinking a

pint of beer, notices Rudy and Terry.

AT THE POOL TABLE: Terry picks Rudy up and turns him upside

down. Rudy laughs.

EXT. SAMMY'S HOUSE. NIGHT

The house is dark. Terry and Rudy are walking from the car

to the house.

They listen. A CAR is COMING.

They break for the door, Terry fumbling for his key. He gets

the door open.

He and Rudy run inside the house. The lights go on. BOB'S

CAR pulls into the DRIVEWAY.

INT. THE HOUSE -- FRONT DOOR. SIMULTANEOUS

Rudy runs up the stairs.

Rudy tries to take his jacket off fast but gets his arm caught

in the sleeve. He tries to shake it off.

They HEAR Bob's CAR DOORS SLAM. Terry makes a comic panicked

face and leaps up the stairs two at a time.

OUTSIDE THE HOUSE: Sammy waves to Bob. Bob waves back as he

drives off. Sammy goes to the front door, opens it:

Terry and Rudy are in a giggly tangled panicked heap at the

top of the stairs, shaking Rudy's arm and sleeve, frantically

trying to get the jacket off.

Sammy comes in. They freeze.

INT. BATHROOM. LATER

Rudy is brushing his teeth. Terry pokes his head in.

Terry gives him a "You better not" look, then leaves. Rudy

continues brushing his teeth.

INT. RUDY'S ROOM. NIGHT

Sammy is tucking Rudy in, stroking his hair.

INT. HALL. NIGHT

Sammy comes out of Rudy's room, smiling. It's dark. She sees

a LIGHT on under TERRY'S DOOR. She walks toward it and steps

into the TRENCH, falling down violently.

INT. BATHROOM. NIGHT

Terry is putting a butterfly Band-Aid on Sammy's wound. It's

a nasty, bloody gash, just shy of needing stitches.

INT. SAMMY'S ROOM. NIGHT

RAIN patters on the ROOF as Sammy LIMPS back and forth across

the room changing into her nightgown.

EXT. TERRY'S WINDOW. NIGHT

Terry is smoking pot with his head and shoulders stuck outside

EXT. BANK. MORNING

Early morning. The RAIN is still falling. Only a few cars

are in the employee parking lot yet.

INT. BANK -- BRIAN'S OFFICE. DAY

The RAIN runs down Brian's office window. BRIAN, in a wet

raincoat, turns on his light.

A MOMENT LATER: Brian turns on his PC. The SCREEN lights up.

The COLORS are a garish GREEN and ORANGE.

LATER: SAMMY and BRIAN are both on their feet. The door is

closed.

Pause.

OUTSIDE BRIAN'S OFFICE: The whole staff is listening to the

muffled raised VOICES from inside the office.

MABEL especially is listening guiltily.

EXT. MAIN STREET. DAY

The rain falls on Main Street.

EXT. ORRIN'S BACKYARD. DAY

Tarps cover everything. No work today.

EXT. MAIN STREET -- LUNCH PLACE. DAY

The rain comes down on the SHERIFF, looking through the

restaurant WINDOW at SAMMY, eating lunch alone at the counter.

He goes inside, shakes the rain off himself and goes over to

her. They start talking. We HEAR:

INT. SAMMY'S HOUSE -- LIVING ROOM. DAY

The RAIN on the roof makes a sleepy, pleasant country sound.

TERRY is lying on the sofa, smoking a joint, watching TV, in

a funk. O.C. we LOUD BANGING ON THE PIPES.

LATER: A YOUNG PLUMBER, about Terry's age, comes thumping

down the stairs and goes into the living room, carrying his

toolbox. Terry looks up at him.

Terry glares at him. The plumber turns and goes out.

EXT. BUS STOP. DAY

RUDY is WAITING in a doorway for Terry. He is wet and cold.

The RAIN pours down.

INT. BANK. DAY

Brian is showing his wife, NANCY, the bank. He is very

solicitous of her, nervously introducing her to the employees,

who are not responding very warmly. Nancy is not in a warm

mood either; she's very testy with Brian.

SAMMY, at her desk, watches Brian and Nancy make their

progress through the bank. Nobody is being very friendly,

and Brian suddenly seems awkward and vulnerable. Brian and

Nancy reach Sammy's desk.

He glances nervously at Sammy as he leads Nancy away from

her desk and toward his office. He murmurs something to Nancy,

who responds in a low but very testy voice:

She roughly pulls her arm away from his. Sammy watches them

go into his office.

EXT. MAIN STREET. DAY

Rudy trudges resolutely through the pouring rain toward the

center of town. He is completely drenched.

INT. BRIAN'S OFFICE. DAY

Sammy knocks on Brian's open door.

Sammy sees to her left, down the hallway --

Rudy is at the end of the hall, drenched and shivering, but

cheerful.

EXT. EMPLOYEE PARKING LOT. DAY

Rudy is in the car, somewhat dried off, waiting. Sammy and

Terry stand in the employee entrance doorway.

Pause.

INT./EXT. SAMMY'S CAR/CAROL'S DRIVEWAY. DAY

Terry and Rudy pull up in front of the driveway. Terry is in

a silent rage. The rain has let up.

He leans over Rudy roughly and pushes open the door. Rudy

gets out of the car and marches down the long driveway. He

bursts into tears.

Terry watches him go, then drives off.

INT. BANK -- HALL. A FEW MOMENTS LATER

Sammy walks through the empty bank hall and into Brian's

office. Brian is at his desk.

Pause.

INT. PUB. NIGHT

Brian and Sammy sit at a table in the corner of the dimly

lit pub. It's a medium noisy place with various locals

drinking beers and eating hamburgers and chicken dinners.

The waitress brings them two boilermakers.

SAMMY and BRIAN Thanks.

She leaves. Sammy and Brian pick up their shots.

They click shot glasses and drink.

They sip their drinks, smiling. Sammy looks at him

appraisingly.

INT./EXT. BRIAN'S CAR/WOODED ROAD. NIGHT

Sammy and Brian are making out in the front seat of his car.

This goes on for a while, getting heavier and heavier.

They start kissing again in the cramped space. Brian bangs

his head. They laugh.

EXT. OUTSIDE THE CAR. CONTINUOUS

We pull back and away from the car. The sodden trees spout

faucets of water down on the car.

INT. KITCHEN. NIGHT

The kitchen is dark. Sammy comes in, her hair a little wet,

and turns on the light. She goes to the telephone.

There's a NOTE in Terry's handwriting:

"BOB CALLED."
