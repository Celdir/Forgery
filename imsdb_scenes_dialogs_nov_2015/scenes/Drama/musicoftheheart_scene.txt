INT. GUASPARI HOUSEHOLD, ROME, N. Y. - BEDROOM - DAY (1988)

We hear the sound of KNOCKING as the CAMERA PANS a small,

darkened guest room. A few streaks of daylight filter through

Venetian blinds.

The CAMERA finds a WOMAN lying face down on a twin bed, thick

wavy hair sprawled across her shoulders.

The KNOCKING continues, and she puts the pillow over the top

of her head.

END CREDITS

INT. GUASPARI BEDROOM - DAY

The WOMAN -- ROBERTA GUASPARI-DEMETRAS (38) -- retrieves the

photo album from the floor, looks at a photo and removes it.

She's a beautiful woman with large, expressive eyes, but

right now she looks like hell. She stares at the photo --

it's the two couples dancing. A quick glimpse of hurt on her

face, then her jaw tightens and she rips the picture in half.

There's muffled talking outside the door, and then two young

boys' voices.

She puts the half with her and her husband on the dresser,

then tears the woman off the other half and rips her into

pieces.

O.S. arguing "I DID NOT!" "YES YOU DID!" "LIAR!" etc. As if

that one action siphoned all her energy, Roberta returns to

bed, gets into fetal position, and stares at a point beyond

the wall, ignoring the O.S. voices.

EXT. GUASPARI HOUSE - DOORWAY - DAY

ASSUNTA GUASPARI (58), Roberta's slender, tired Italian-

American mother, stands in the doorway of a well-tended

working-class home, addressing a young NAVAL OFFICER who

holds a lengthy delivery inventory. It's a gray day with

ominous storm clouds. Late 70's CARS are parked on the street.

Assunta looks beyond the man, dismayed.

HER POV

Large wooden CRATES cover her front lawn, and TWO MOVERS

plant down another. They hurry back to the TRUCK, grabbing

the next crate too quickly this time. It slips from their

hands, CRASHES to the ground and splinters open. Several

VIOLIN CASES spill out. The crate looks like it holds a whole

lot more.

BACK TO SCENE

Instantly a second-story window is flung open, and Roberta

sticks her head out, a hundred times more energized than

we've seen her so far.

The men scramble to pick them up. Assunta looks at all the

violins, then up at Roberta.

Roberta disappears inside and slams the window shut.

INT. GUASPARI LIVING ROOM - DAY

The living room is filled with boxes shipped from Greece,

labelled by the U.S. NAVY. And on the floor, in the middle

of the boxes, are FIFTY VIOLIN CASES of various sizes, also

with Greek and U.S. NAVY labels. NICK (7) and LEXI (5) climb

over the boxes as if they were giant blocks.

INT. GUASPARI HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

ROBERTA'S on the phone, yelling at someone. She's still in

the same ratty nightgown.

ASSUNTA grabs the phone from her hand and hangs it up.

She exits, leaving Roberta to mull over her words.

INT. GUASPARI KITCHEN - DAY

Coffee is brewing and homemade cinnamon rolls are cooling on

a rack. We recognize the kitchen from the home movie footage.

As Assunta clears the boys' breakfast dishes from the table,

Roberta enters. She's dressed, but hasn't put on makeup or

done much with her hair. It's a start.

Roberta half-smiles, pours herself some coffee, then sits

down at the table.

Assunta's face shows she's doubtful about this.

INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - GIFT WRAP COUNTER - ROME, N.Y. - DAY

Roberta is behind the counter, meticulously wrapping a present

with ribbons, bows and stickers. At one point she even unties

a ribbon and redoes it because it's not perfect. She looks

pretty, but she's dressed conservatively, like a navy

housewife. There's only one other clerk wrapping gifts and a

long line of impatient customers. A male SUPERVISOR appears

behind Roberta.

He exits, and Roberta quickly tries to finish her task.

Roberta looks up to find BRIAN TURNER (40), a handsome, sexy

guy with longish hair and a beat-up leather jacket.

He holds out his hand. Roberta misunderstands the gesture

and tries to shake his hand.

Roberta hands him the gift she's been wrapping.

Roberta smiles.

HOLD ON ROBERTA as she takes this in.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - ROME, N.Y. - DAY

Roberta sits opposite Brian. Her lunch is untouched.

A beat.

A beat as she gets lost in the memory. She takes a bite of a

french fry.

Roberta smiles, blushing a bit. Brian looks at her, getting

an idea.

EXT. SPANISH HARLEM, NEW YORK CITY - TRAVELLING SHOT - DAY

A SALSA SONG PLAYS OVER as we see stores with Spanish names

and signs; Black and Latino elementary school children walking

home from school; some burned-out buildings; Black and Latino

teens playing basketball on a cement court; Spanish graffiti

on walls; elderly women buying fruit at a produce stand.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL this is the POV of Roberta from the back

seat of a cab. The SALSA SONG plays on the cab's radio.

Roberta looks scared shitless.

Suddenly, two YOUNG MEN flash down the middle of the street,

dart IN FRONT of the cab and the driver SLAMS on the brakes,

jerking Roberta forward.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK EAST ELEMENTARY SCHOOL (CPE 1) - EAST

HARLEM - ESTABLISHING - DAY

INT. JANET WILLIAMS' OFFICE - DAY

JANET WILLIAMS, a Black woman (40's) with a kind face, sits

behind her desk and looks at Roberta's resume. A sign on her

desk indicates that she's the DIRECTOR. Also on the desk is

a FRAMED PICTURE of Janet, her husband, daughter (14), and

son (12). Roberta sits nervously in the chair opposite her.

Janet looks for this on the resume.

Janet smiles politely.

Roberta nods, defeated.

INT. CPE 1 - HALLWAY - DAY

Roberta stands outside Janet's office, dejectedly watching

the children noisily running through the hall.

INT. AREA OUTSIDE JANET WILLIAMS' OFFICE - THE NEXT DAY

Roberta knocks on Janet's door.

As Roberta opens the door, we see that Nick and Lexi are

with her. All three have violins. INSIDE, Janet's in

conversation with DENNIS RAUSCH (38), an uptight man with a

tie that doesn't match his suit jacket. He's showing Janet a

large scheduling chart.

They enter.

INT. JANET'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Janet smiles at the boys, but clearly thinks Roberta's a

little off. Roberta holds her hand out to Dennis.

Dennis shakes her hand, regarding her warily.

Before Janet can answer, Roberta and the kids quickly take

out their violins and get into position. Janet and Dennis

exchange a look.

Roberta ignores the jab, then nods to the boys. The three of

them begin an incredibly impressive violin trio, playing an

ETUDE in three-part harmony. For the first measures, Janet's

still annoyed by the intrusion, but she's quickly won over.

Dennis watches impassively.

Roberta and the boys finish their piece; Janet applauds and

Dennis joins in to be polite. The three take bows. A beat.

Janet laughs, then gestures for them to sit.

Roberta gives Nick a look, but Janet smiles.

Dennis laughs. Roberta looks at him, a bit miffed.

A beat. Janet observes the tension, then turns to Roberta.

We see relief -- and fear -- in Roberta's face.

INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY

In a noisy music room with bad acoustics, Roberta tries to

take control of fifty kids, third through fifth-graders, who

are in a state of manic excitement over the FIFTY VIOLIN

CASES on the floor.

They ignore her.

ANGLE - Three girls open their cases.

ANGLE - Two boys open their cases.

ANGLE - Three kids are using the violin cases as pretend

machine guns -- and shooting each other.

ANGLE - A boy and a girl are having a "sword fight" with

their bows.

There's the SOUND of violin strings being plucked.

Roberta wheels around to find a girl plucking her violin

like a banjo, and doing a little dance. This is LUCY, a skinny

Puerto Rican girl in perpetual motion.

Roberta takes a breath. The kids settle down a bit.

ANGLE - A boy plays "bongos" on his violin case.

The bongo player stands.

The child looks stunned.

With a sheepish expression, he exits. The room is finally

quiet -- and Roberta's amazed that something worked. She

puffs up a little bit, enjoying the feeling of control.

The students stare at her, afraid of her now. DE SEAN, a

small but tough Black boy, raises his hand.

She looks around the room.

Silence.

INT. MUSIC ROOM - LATER

In front of the class, Roberta helps NAEEM, a graceful Black

boy, hold the violin. He has a serious expression and a scar

on his left cheek. Roberta controls the bow and fingerboard,

but it appears that the boy is playing music. He smiles.

Roberta laughs.

Roberta writes in a notebook and we see that she's measuring

for violin sizes.

ON THE KIDS, not used to a teacher speaking like that.

INT. BRIAN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

A funky apartment on the Upper West Side. Nick and Lexi are

both asleep in sleeping bags on top of a futon on the floor,

their suitcases nearby. Brian tiptoes past them, carrying

two glasses of champagne. He knocks on his office door.

INT. BRIAN'S APARTMENT - OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Roberta's in a bathrobe and nightgown, some rollers in her

hair. She's tidying up her suitcase, etc., next to an old

couch that's been made up as a bed. Leftist political books

line a shelf above Brian's desk, including copies of his

own, TO HELL AND BACK: INTERVIEWS WITH VIETNAM VETS by BRIAN

TURNER. His desk is covered with files and books pertaining

to MIGRANT WORKERS. Brian enters.

They clink glasses and drink.

Roberta laughs.

Brian comes up behind her and starts to kiss her neck.

Roberta's scared -- so she keeps talking, as if it's not

really happening.

Roberta's aroused, in spite of herself. She turns around and

faces him.

He gives her a flirtatious smile, then takes out one of her

rollers.

He moves to takes out another roller and Roberta stops him.

She laughs wistfully, then looks a little sad.

He pulls her towards him by the belt to her robe.

They kiss and it heats up quickly. Roberta pulls back.

A few beats, and she moves towards him.

INT. BRIAN'S BEDROOM - DAY

Sun streams into the room as Roberta awakens in Brian's bed,

a look of afterglow on her face. She suddenly remembers where

she is, and quickly looks at the clock.

She turns, relieved, until she sees that Brian's packing a

suitcase.

He dashes out. Roberta sits up, rattled by this news.

INT. BRIAN'S OFFICE - DAY

Brian excitedly gathers papers and files scattered around

his electric typewriter.

He turns to see Roberta in the doorway.

He places items into a carry-on bag, packing at a rapid clip.

In contrast, Roberta seems to be moving in slow motion.

INT. BRIAN'S BATHROOM - DAY

Brian throws toiletries into a plastic bag. Roberta enters.

He stops what he's doing and looks at her.

We see in her face that part of her did think that.

Brian softens as he sees how vulnerable she is. He takes her

in his arms.

She attempts a smile.

He kisses her forehead, then exits. HOLD ON ROBERTA, looking

hurt and frightened.

INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY

Roberta rosins her bow, standing in front of ten kids --

third through fifth-grade -- who sit on the floor next to

their violin cases. The kids are Black and Latino, with a

couple of white faces. They're all talking and ignoring

Roberta except for NAEEM and GUADALUPE, a petite Mexican

girl with a long dark braid. [NOTE: We'll see other violin

students from time to time, but this is the class we'll follow

for Roberta's first year]

The kids quiet down. Only Naeem raises his hand.

Again, only Naeem raises his hand. Roberta sees him but turns

to DE SEAN, who's talking to his neighbor.

This makes De Sean blush -- and it pisses him off.

Some kids giggle and joke about this. Roberta points to the

scroll of the violin.

LUCY, the fidgety girl, snaps her fingers.

The kids laugh. Roberta doesn't. She points to the scroll.

Roberta laughs, even though she's trying to be tough.

INT. DENNIS' MUSIC CLASSROOM - DAY

Dennis's twenty students play recorder in rows of attached

theatre-style seats. Dennis sits at his desk, a METRONOME

ticking, and apathetically leads them in scales, using a red

pen as a baton. He keeps one eye on a stack of quizzes that

he's marking, stopping to circle mistakes with the pen.

ANGLE - Roberta stands in the hallway at the open door,

dismayed by Dennis' uninspired teaching. She enters and

crosses to Dennis, speaking quietly to him.

The students immediately start to chatter.

He looks back at Roberta, annoyed by her intrusion.

She exits.

INT. BRIAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Lexi and Nick are in Brian's bed. Roberta's tucking in Lexi;

he holds a toy truck with Greek writing on it.

Roberta looks at Nick, then turns back to Lexi.

Roberta turns to Nick and tucks him in.

She turns back to Nick who looks worried. She kisses him.

She kisses Lexi, then reaches to turn off the lamp.

Roberta nods, smiles at her sons, and exits.

INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY

Nine children stand, violins under their right arms, bows

hanging down from their right hands, and try to position

their feet as Roberta addresses them.

She walks over to BENJAMIN, a white boy with glasses, and

corrects his feet. She sees Lucy dancing in place.

Lucy nods, giggling. Roberta walks down the row of students.

She crosses to TANISHA, a sweet-natured Black girl with her

hair in tiny braids, and gently pushes her belly.

Roberta turns to De Sean, who's talking to JAMES, a pudgy

Black/Puerto Rican boy.

She gently pushes Guadalupe's belly. The girl stumbles back.

Guadalupe tries to correct her feet. Roberta bends down to

help and sees that the little girl wears LEG BRACES under

her pants. Roberta stands and gestures to one of the boys.

The boy brings the chair. Guadalupe sits, embarrassed.

EXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY

Roberta walks through a school yard filled with kids and

parents picking them up. She sees Naeem and crosses to him.

NAEEM'S MOTHER, MRS. ADISA, steps INTO FRAME. She's an

attractive Black woman in a dress and head scarf made of

African fabric.

Mrs. Adisa puts a protective arm around her son, then

addresses Roberta.

She walks off with Naeem. He glances back at Roberta, then

turns away quickly. Roberta watches after them.

INT. BRIAN'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Roberta attempts to read Brian's book, To Hell and Back:

Interviews with Vietnam Vets, but she's distracted. She

glances at her purse, then back to the book. She puts the

book down and dials the phone.

While she waits, she looks at Brian's picture on the book

jacket. There's no answer and she hangs up. She starts to

straighten the already clean room, then gets her purse, takes

out her wallet, and opens it to the plastic covered pictures.

INSERT - PICTURES

Charles in uniform; a studio shot of the boys when they were

3 and 1; the whole family posed on the terrace of their home

in Greece, a view of the ocean behind them.

BACK TO ROBERTA

She's really depressed herself now.

INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

ALICE CROWLEY (50's), a no-nonsense Black teacher, shows her

fifth-graders a globe. She doesn't turn as Roberta enters

and crosses to her. In the b.g. we see ROBERTA'S STUDENTS

waiting in THE HALL.

Kids simultaneously yell out "ATLANTIC" and "PACIFIC."

Roberta's reluctant to argue in front of the kids; she exits.

EXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY

Lots of noise and chaos as kids run wild during lunch recess.

Janet rushes through the throngs while Roberta tries to keep

up.

Janet stops walking and pulls a box cutter out of her pocket.

Janet starts to walk away, then turns.

Roberta stands there as Janet walks on ahead.

INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY

The nine children hold their violins in position as Roberta

addresses them.

ON THE CHILDREN, attempting this. She walks around and helps.

Some kids crack up and start joking and chatting.

Some of the children think about what she's saying. A couple,

uncomfortable with the intensity, hold back giggles.

Roberta sees Guadalupe struggling.

Embarrassed, Guadalupe corrects her position.

INT. BRIAN'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

At the small kitchen table, Nick does homework and Lexi puts

stickers in a sticker book. Roberta's cooking dinner; she

grabs a potholder and checks on a bubbling lasagna in the

oven. The PHONE RINGS and she answers it.

Her face falls as she hears the voice. She holds onto the

counter to steady herself.

Roberta closes the oven and gathers her courage.

A beat.

We watch Roberta's body collapse into a sense of overwhelming

relief. FOLLOW HER as she steps into THE HALLWAY, then

stretches the phone into:

INT. BRIAN'S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

She half-closes the door, leans against the sink and starts

to cry.

Roberta looks as if she's been slapped. A beat.

Silence.

HOLD ON ROBERTA, devastated. ANGLE on NICK, watching her

through the door.

INT. BRIAN'S HOTEL ROOM, TEXAS - NIGHT

Brian's on the phone with Roberta. He's in a t-shirt and

sweats, and his papers are scattered on the bed.

INTERCUT

Roberta in Brian's living room. She's extremely agitated and

her eyes are puffy from crying.

This embarrasses her, then pisses her off.

INT. BRIAN'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Roberta lies awake on the futon, heartbroken.

INT. BRIAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Roberta stands and watches Nick and Lexi sleep. She lies

down beside them and closes her eyes.

INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

Roberta walks through crowds of kids towards Janet who's in

the middle of confronting a boy student. Janet holds a FIFTY-

DOLLAR BILL. Roberta hangs back and waits for a chance to

speak.

Janet gives him a stern look.

As Janet turns to walk off, Roberta crosses to her.

Roberta watches as Janet dashes off with the boy in tow.

INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY

Guadalupe sits on a chair in the empty room, struggling to

set up her violin. Roberta enters, surprised to see her.

Guadalupe sighs, then hands Roberta the violin.

Roberta looks at her sadly and puts the violin in its case.

Guadalupe takes this in.

Roberta laughs.

Guadalupe nods. Roberta holds out the violin case. Guadalupe

lunges forward and hugs her around the waist. Roberta

awkwardly accepts the hug, startled and touched by it, and

strokes the girl's hair. Guadalupe lets go, takes the violin

and exits. HOLD ON ROBERTA as she absorbs what just happened.

JANET pokes her head into the room.

Janet looks at her curiously, then exits.

INT. EMPTY APARTMENT - EAST HARLEM - DAY

Roberta walks around an empty, rundown apartment, her

expression somber. Crayon markings on the walls, cigarette

burns on the floors, a filthy bathroom and kitchen. An older

Puerto Rican woman stands back as Roberta inspects the place.

Roberta wipes grease off one of the windows.

A beat.

EXT. SCHOOL YARD - LUNCH RECESS - DAY

Roberta enters the yard from inside the school. It's filled

with kids playing, including Nick and Lexi. She waves to

them and Lexi runs up to her, carrying a piece of artwork.

He gives her a tempera PAINTING of a man's face, the

background decorated with glued-on macaroni. It says DADDY.

He runs off. Roberta exhales, sits down alone on a bench and

takes out her lunch. She smiles at ALICE CROWLEY and another

TEACHER but they cross to another bench. ISABEL VASQUEZ (25)

approaches, a lively Puerto Rican woman with a strong New

York accent.

She sits down beside Roberta, takes out her lunch.

Roberta laughs.

Roberta smiles.

INT. ROBERTA'S NEW APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

LEXI'S PAINTING is on the wall, along with a crayon drawing

of himself, Roberta, and Nick in front of a house.

ANGLE - ROBERTA looks out the window. She's gotten some used

furniture, cleaned the place, and it's less depressing.

ROBERTA'S POV OUT THE WINDOW

On the street below, three prostitutes stand at the corner.

Two men sit on a stoop, smoking a joint, and in a parked

car, three men seem to be making a drug deal. One of the

buildings on the street is burned out, missing a front door.

BACK TO SCENE

Nick, in his pajamas, enters and crosses to his mother. She

smiles at him and they both look out the window.

Roberta smiles and puts her arm around him.

Roberta tenses up.

A beat.

Roberta looks at him, concerned that he's not responding to

her news.

A beat as she contemplates whether to push or not, then:

She looks at him, taken aback by the question.

Roberta, overcome with emotion, can barely answer.

The CAMERA moves behind them as they continue to look out

the window, and we see Nick move away from his mother.

INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY

The kids play "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" and they sound

awful. Roberta looks disgusted as she leads them.

Roberta rolls her eyes, then turns to Lucy.

A beat.

Roberta stands there, sobered.

EXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY

A group of kids stand together with their violins and chat.

Roberta exits the building and they greet her. She waves

back, but she's clearly still upset by her interaction with

Lucy. She sees Naeem and his mother and approaches them.

Naeem nods and moves off.

Mrs. Adisa takes this in. Roberta exits. Mrs. Adisa looks

for Naeem and sees him watching the violin students, longing

to be among them. She watches her son with compassion.

EXT. OUTDOOR MARKET - DAY

Roberta and the boys shop in a colorful outdoor produce market

in their neighborhood.

The boys suddenly rush over to A MAN sitting on the ground

with mixed-breed PUPPIES in a cardboard box. The boys pet

them excitedly. Roberta watches her sons; they're happier

than she's seen them in ages.

INT. ROBERTA'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

A brown puppy is jumping all over Nick and Lexi who laugh

delightedly. Roberta is putting down newspapers.

The boys are oblivious to her -- they're in heaven.

INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY

Roberta's SCREAMING at the kids as they play "Twinkle Twinkle

Little Star."

They stop playing. Tanisha raises her hand.

Tanisha nods.

Some of the kids crack up.

The door opens and Naeem enters with Mrs. Adisa. Roberta

crosses to them.

A beat.

Naeem happily runs to the extra violins at the front of the

room; Mrs. Adisa nods to Roberta with a look of gratitude,

then exits. Roberta crosses back to the front of the room.

They begin again, and we see Naeem take out a violin and

join in. As they play, Roberta's ears perk up at something

she's hearing. She crosses to Lucy.

Lucy hesitates, thinking she's in trouble. She plays a jazz

variation of the song. Roberta smiles.

Lucy beams.

The class plays Lucy's jazz variation and Naeem happily joins

in.

INT. JANET WILLIAMS' OFFICE - DAY

Roberta sits opposite Janet and MRS. LAMB, a white woman in

her 30's.

Janet raises her eyebrows at this.

She gives Roberta a long hard look. Roberta nods.

INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY

Roberta listens to the students play "Go Tell Aunt Rhody" --

badly. They finish and stare at her, afraid of her response.

They look at her in disbelief, then look at each other.

The boy nervously shakes his head no.

James nods. The kids are baffled by her politeness.

A beat.

The kids laugh.

The kids laugh again.

INT. KENNEDY AIRPORT - DEPARTURE GATE - DAY

Christmas MUZAK plays in the b.g. as Roberta kisses and hugs

Lexi and Nick goodbye. A FLIGHT ATTENDANT stands nearby.

Lexi looks upset; Nick is stoic. Roberta hugs them one last

time. The FLIGHT ATTENDANT steps forward.

The FLIGHT ATTENDANT escorts them into the jet way. Roberta

holds back tears as they get further away from her. At the

last moment, Lexi turns and waves; Nick does not. Roberta

waves, tears starting to fall, and the boys disappear from

sight. She observes all the families travelling together,

and feels like the loneliest person in the airport.

INT. ROBERTA'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Roberta enters her apartment, back from the airport, and

double-locks the door behind her. You can see on her face

that she's dreading the emptiness. She crosses to a small

Christmas tree, obviously decorated by her and the boys, and

plugs in the tiny blinking lights. It's not exactly

Rockefeller Center. She turns on the T.V., playing IT'S A

WONDERFUL LIFE.

She crosses to the kitchen, then returns with a carton of

eggnog, a glass, and a bottle of rum. She sits down on the

couch, pours herself some eggnog, adds rum, adds more rum,

goes back into the kitchen, returns with nutmeg, sprinkles

some on top, then drinks. She sighs, glancing miserably at

the tree and the T.V. Pathetic. She couldn't look any less

festive if she tried. There's a KNOCK on the DOOR.

Roberta gets up and warily approaches the door.

She looks through the peephole, then quickly unlocks the

door and opens it, revealing BRIAN, giving her a big smile.

He looks sexy as hell (even with a silly lit-up Santa Claus

pin on his leather jacket), and he holds a long-stemmed red

rose in one hand, and a Christmas present in the other.

Roberta's thrilled and relieved to see him. She embraces

him, and they kiss passionately.

INT. BROWNSTONE - DAY (TIME CUT - TWO MONTHS LATER)

CLOSE ON plaster walls being knocked down with sledgehammers.

REVEAL Brian, Roberta, and a couple of workmen knocking down

the walls in an old brownstone.

EXT. BROWNSTONE - EAST HARLEM - THE SAME DAY

A mild winter day. Roberta, covered with plaster dust and

overheated from working, leans against a car and drinks a

beer. The three-story brick building has some graffiti on it

and is badly in need of a paint job; there are a few broken

windows, and the front stairs need repairing. WORKMEN file

in and out. We can see from the STREET SIGNS that we're on

118th STREET, a few houses off FIRST AVENUE.

Brian (also dust-covered), Nick and Lexi toss around a

football. LAWRENCE (6), a Black boy who lives next door,

joins them. Brian crosses to Roberta, sweaty and out of

breath. He takes a swig of her beer.

She laughs and they kiss.

ASSUNTA comes up the street with a bag of take-out food. She

casts a dubious glance at the lovers.

Roberta rolls her eyes. O.S. a car BACKFIRES.

The boys approach and Assunta hands them sandwiches. Lawrence

hangs back. Assunta calls to him.

Lawrence nods and she hands him a sandwich. Roberta smiles

at her mother's gesture. The kids move off to Lawrence's

front steps and Assunta gives Roberta and Brian sandwiches.

INT. ROBERTA'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - DAY

Robert washes dishes and Assunta dries. The leftovers from

an Italian dinner are on the counter.

Assunta backs off. Roberta feels guilty and moves to her.

A few beats.

Roberta locks her jaw, not wanting to believe that she's

right.

INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY

The kids play "Allegro," Roberta leading them.

They reach a certain note, then pause.

She starts for the door and the kids moan and groan: "Come

on, Roberta!" "Roberta, get back here!" She smiles.

She nods. They begin again -- all at different times.

All the kids raise their hands. De Sean looks around,

embarrassed, then raises his too. Roberta smiles.

INT. ROBERTA'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Brian and Roberta finish making love on the futon. They lie

in each other's arms, still breathing heavily.

Brian makes a sound that's either panting or laughing.

Roberta looks at him, offended.

She disentangles from him.

She angrily turns on her side with her back to him. Brian

regrets hurting her and moves to her, kissing her shoulder.

He laughs and coaxes her to kiss him -- a temporary truce.

INT. BROWNSTONE - DAY

ERNIE (70's), a rickety Black man in work boots, looks baffled

by a tangled mess of wires protruding from a wall. Roberta

approaches.

Brian overhears, rolls his eyes and pulls her aside.

Brian sighs and walks off into another room. Two MEN carry

in large panels of sheetrock with old WALLPAPER on it.

They lean the panels against a wall. Roberta turns to Ernie.

The guys quickly exit. Brian re-enters and sees the panels.

Roberta feels stupid but doesn't want to show it.

He stomps off. ANOTHER ANGLE - Nick watches them fight and

looks distressed.

EXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY

Lots of screaming and commotion as the kids crowd around a

fight in progress. As we move through the crowd we see that

NICK's in a fight with another boy; Nick's nose is bleeding

and he has the boy in a headlock. TWO TEACHERS run over to

break it up.

INT. AREA OUTSIDE JANET'S OFFICE - DAY

Nick sits outside, holding an ice pack to his bloody nose.

INT. JANET'S OFFICE - DAY

Roberta stands opposite Janet.

Roberta takes this in, upset.

INT. ROBERTA'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Roberta plays "Go Tell Aunt Rhody" with Guadalupe, De Sean,

Naeem, Benjamin, and two kids from the other classes. Lexi

plays along with them. Nick enters from the kitchen, eating

a cookie, ignoring the students. He turns on the T.V.

Roberta crosses to Nick and shuts off the T.V.

He reaches for the T.V. dial and she stops him.

She crosses back to her students; Nick turns on the T.V.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

Brian, Nick and Lexi laugh as they play frisbee alongside a

DUCK POND. Roberta watches, relieved to see Nick enjoying

himself.

Nick throws it back to Brian and it lands in the WATER.

He stalks towards Nick menacingly, picks him up and pretends

he's going to throw him into the water. Nick laughs

hysterically.

He pretends again to throw Nick in, then puts him down. Lexi

holds out his arms to Brian.

Brian swoops him up and Lexi starts laughing. Roberta laughs

along, happy to see the affection between Brian and her sons.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK - A LITTLE LATER

Brian and Roberta speak as they stroll; the boys run ahead

of them, dragging sticks along the pavement. In the b.g. we

see HARLEM STREETS bordering the park.

This is making her nervous. She looks at him, afraid of what

he might be saying.

He heaves a sigh of frustration, not wanting to answer the

question.

A beat.

Roberta looks very disheartened. Brian feels badly.

He pulls her to him, kissing her neck, but she pulls away

from him. ON NICK, observing with an anxious expression.

INT. ROBERTA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Roberta looks distressed by her talk with Brian as she and

the boys enter, back from the park.

Nick stomps off to get his violin. Lexi follows. Roberta

puts down her bag and takes off her coat. While Lexi sets up

his violin, Nick opens his violin case, takes out the violin

and angrily starts playing, loudly and roughly.

Nick THROWS the violin against the floor. Roberta's

speechless.

Nick picks up the violin and THROWS the violin down even

harder, then YELLS at Roberta before she can even respond.

Roberta is stunned. The anger drains out of her as she

suddenly sees what this is all about.

This hits her in the solar plexus. Her hurt and vulnerability

start to pour out.

Roberta hesitates, but knows she has to tell them the truth.

She addresses both boys.

Roberta swallows, shocked to hear him ask this. She can hardly

answer him.

Nick and Lexi look very upset, not only from hearing the

finality in her words, but from seeing their mother's pain.

Roberta moves closer to them.

Nick starts crying. Roberta takes him in her arms. Lexi starts

to cry and Roberta holds him too.

INT. BROWNSTONE - DAY

Ernie's radio plays a BLUES SONG. The BRICK WORKERS radio

plays SPANISH MUSIC, and the PAINTERS' radio plays a RAP

SONG. Roberta stands in the middle, about to lose her mind.

HER POV - Ernie sits on a stool facing his wiring. He's fast

asleep. ANOTHER ANGLE - The brick workers build a crooked

fireplace.

BACK TO SCENE

Roberta sighs heavily, then crosses to the painters.

Brian watches this interaction as he sands a door.

She crosses to Ernie and shakes him.

He looks at her groggily.

She crosses to the brick workers.

She crosses to the painters.

Brian smiles at her, impressed.

Brian laughs.

His tone and expression tell her the words are not

forthcoming.

He looks at her, shocked by her toughness, but knows he can't

give her what she wants. He exits. Roberta stands in the

middle of the room, a determined look on her face.

INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - NIGHT

ROBERTA

Stands in the aisle, leading the students and playing violin.

ON STAGE

The fifty fifth-grade students play the "Twinkle" variations.

Their playing is impeccable and they look terrific.

As the CAMERA PANS the audience, we recognize: MRS. ADISA,

tears in her eyes as she watches Naeem; MRS. LAMB and her

husband, watching Becky in amazement; ISABEL and her daughter

sitting with ASSUNTA, NICK and LEXI; JANET, impressed as

hell; and DENNIS, seething with jealousy. As the kids start

the jazz variation of "Twinkle," a WOMAN elbows her husband:

The CAMERA returns to the children and captures their own

pride in their playing, including LUCY, who smiles as she

hears her song played by fifty.

THE CONCERT - TIME DISSOLVE

The students are now playing "Allegro," and they reach the

fermata. They hold their positions in silence and the audience

watches in anticipation. Roberta cues them and they play the

next note in perfect unison. An involuntary smile lights on

DE SEAN's face. They finish the song, the audience applauds,

and Roberta turns to face them.

She lights up when she sees how thrilled Janet looks, and

Janet in turn raises her hands higher as she applauds Roberta.

EXT. CPE 1 - DAY - ESTABLISHING - TIME CUT (1998)

The side of the building now has an impressive mural: an

urban landscape with three super heroes -- Puerto Rican,

Black, and white -- rising up out of the street. It reads

ONLY THE STRONG SHALL SURVIVE.

INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

Roberta stands in front of a classroom of twenty cute first-

graders -- mostly Black and Latino, a few white -- sitting

on the floor, chatting excitedly. Even though Roberta's ten

years older, she seems more youthful; her wavy hair is loose

over her shoulders, her clothing's casual and artistic. Beside

her is Janet, her hair flecked with gray, and Dennis, who

looks pretty much the same. The classroom teacher is ISABEL,

a little older, a little tougher.

CUTAWAY to Roberta and Janet exchanging glances over Dennis

taking credit for the program.

JUSTIN, a Black boy with attitude, raises his hand. He always

wears a puffy red, yellow and green crocheted beret. Isabel

nods to him.

ANGLE - DOROTHEA (Doro-taya) VAN HAUFTEN (40's), an elegant,

beautiful woman, smartly dressed, takes photographs from the

back of the room.

Roberta steps forward. RAMON OLIVAS (7), a small, adorable

Puerto Rican boy with a crew cut, watches her with adoration.

VANESSA raises her hand, a white girl whose clothes and

accessories are always adorned with cats.

ANGLE - Ramon listens intently with his fingers crossed.

RAMON raises his hand.

Roberta looks at him, struck by his sweetness.

EXT. 118TH STREET - STREET SIGN - ESTABLISHING - DAY

EXT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - DAY

The brownstone looks a lot better than when we last saw it.

Graffiti's been removed, the stairs have been repaired, the

windows have security bars, and there are flowers blooming

in pots in front of the building. Roberta steps INTO FRAME,

walking Allegra, now a 10-year-old dog.

INT. BROWNSTONE - DAY

The house is transformed: the first floor is one long open

room with oak floors, a living room in front with a beautiful

fireplace and a grand piano, and a country kitchen in the

rear, complete with pots hanging over a large butcher block.

NICK (17) practices cello and LEXI (15) practices piano;

they play Haydn's "Trio #13." Now handsome young men, their

blonde hair has darkened to brown. Nick is huskier; Lexi has

a slighter build. Both are passionate, talented musicians.

On the couch, RACHEL (12), a mature, beautiful Black girl,

rosins her bow.

Rachel cracks up but stifles her laughter as Roberta enters

from outside with Allegra.

As Roberta removes Allegra's leash, Rachel and Lexi share a

conspiratorial look. In the b.g., Nick packs up his cello.

Nick jostles him and heads upstairs. Lexi gets up from the

piano.

He crosses to a sharp-looking bike parked behind the front

door and addresses Roberta.

Lexi mouths "be careful" along with her.

EXT. RIVER EAST PARK - DUSK

Lexi plays basketball with a group of Black and Latino guys.

Despite his small stature, he's a great athlete, and an

accepted part of the group. The game ends. He and his buddy

Lawrence (now 16), both all sweaty, cross to a water fountain.

As Lexi takes a drink --

Lexi wipes his mouth and looks up at HENRY (18), a tall,

intimidating Black teenager who towers over him. Lawrence

watches tensely.

Lexi looks at him, knowing there's only one right answer.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Roberta and Rachel play Bach's "Minuet One" together on the

violin. The girl has obvious talent.

Rachel stops, frustrated.

Rachel looks at her in wide-eyed gratitude.

ANGLE - Lexi enters the front door, a glum look on his face.

INT. HONDA/EXT. EAST HARLEM STREETS - NIGHT

Roberta drives with Nick in the front, Lexi and Lawrence in

the back. They're in a dangerous looking part of East Harlem.

Roberta slows the car down next to a HOUSING PROJECT.

EXT. HOUSING PROJECT - NIGHT

Not a place you'd want to go into, even in the day time.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL this is their POV from INSIDE THE CAR.

The boys look frightened, but Roberta's on a mission.

And she exits. The boys watch as she heads for the building,

then Lexi shakes his head and covers his face.

Nick jumps out of the car and heads after her.

Nick hesitates and heads back. Roberta presses on. Lawrence

opens the window and calls to her.

INT. TENEMENT BUILDING - LOBBY - NIGHT

CLOSE ON THE ELEVATOR DOOR with a handwritten SIGN that reads

OUT OF ORDER.

WIDER - Roberta stands in front of the elevator, staring

tensely at the sign. She takes a deep breath, then heads for

the staircase.

INT. TENEMENT BUILDING - STAIRWELL - NIGHT

Roberta climbs the dimly-lit stairs of a dilapidated, scary

building. O.S. a BABY CRIES, a couple of TV's BLARE.

INT. TENEMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

At the top of the stairs, Roberta turns down the hall, passing

a door riddled with bullet holes. She finds the apartment

and knocks. No response. She knocks again.

A beat, then the door cracks open, an OLD WOMAN visible

through the chain lock.

A couple of beats.

The door closes. Roberta exhales. Did she just do that?

EXT. CPE 1 - NIGHT

Roberta, Nick, Lexi and Lawrence sit on the front steps of

the school. The street is deserted.

Roberta sits confidently.

Nick and Lexi roll their eyes and exchange a look: she's

nuts. Suddenly, there's the SOUND of a bicycle. Nick, Lexi

and Lawrence look towards the sound, incredulous. Lexi stands.

Henry rides up on the bike and dismounts. Lexi looks directly

at him as he takes the bike from him.

He glances at Roberta, then walks off.

INT. CPE 1 - CLASSROOM - DAY

Roberta stands in front of Isabel's class and calls out names,

handing the selected children acceptance letters. The kids

are charged up; "My heart is pounding!" "Please pick me!"

A pretty Black girl with braids and tons of barrettes jumps

up and down, then runs up for her letter. The kids SQUEAL

and CHEER for each student called. Shandra hugs her best

friend MYESHA, a chubby Black girl who also holds a letter.

JUSTIN raises his fists in triumph. ANGLE - RAMON anxiously

waits to see if his name will be called. JUSTIN sits down

next to him, waves his letter in Ramon's face, taunting him.

Vanessa takes her letter and smiles. She puts it into her

cat-shaped backpack.

Ramon crosses his fingers and holds his breath.

RAMON looks crushed. JUSTIN taunts him some more. LEONARD, a

scrawny white boy takes his letter, scared by it. He starts

to cry.

Isabel looks at Roberta.

Ramon's face lights up.

EXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY

As Roberta walks through the yard, she sees kids excitedly

showing acceptance letters to their moms.

SHANDRA and MYESHA hold hands as they run to Shandra's mom,

BEVERLY WILSON, pushing a stroller. She looks at the letter

and hugs Shandra.

ANGLE - RAMON reads his letter to his mother, CONCEPCION

(45), whose eyes tell you that she's lived through a lot.

She speaks with a Puerto Rican accent.

Ramon spins round and round with the letter in his hand.

EXT. RIVER EAST ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY

Roberta illegally parks her old Honda, rushes out of the

car, grabs her book bags and three violins, pulls a parking

ticket from her pocket and puts it on the windshield.

Roberta turns. It's DOROTHEA, the PHOTOGRAPHER we saw in the

classroom.

She rushes towards the school and Dorothea follows her.

She hands Roberta a thin box. Roberta puts down her violins,

glances inside it and forgets about being late.

INSERT

-- Terrific black and white shots of Roberta's advanced

classes playing violin.

BACK TO SCENE

They smile at each other.

Dorothea nods, and hands Roberta a card.

RACHEL, heading for school, calls out to Roberta.

Roberta smiles, slips the card in her pocket, nods to Dorothea

and follows Rachel.

INT. RIVER EAST SCHOOL - MUSIC ROOM - DAY

Roberta's advanced class plays "Can-Can." Rachel's one of

the eight sixth-graders. Roberta plays along, crossing to

AMANDA, a white girl in a country-western outfit.

She crosses to a pudgy Black/Puerto Rican boy with glasses.

She glances at STEPHANIE, a white girl with red hair, next

to KENNY, a Black boy with an earnest expression.

CARLOS (13) hurries in, a handsome Black boy in a baseball

jacket that says "LOS LEONES." He looks 15.

He nervously looks down the hall.

A Black third-grade girl rushes into the room and hands Carlos

his violin, then runs off. Roberta crosses to Carlos as he

quickly readies the violin.

He nods sullenly.

Carlos takes this in as Roberta crosses to another student.

EXT. RAMON'S APARTMENT - EAST HARLEM - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

It's upstairs from a grocery store on a busy street.

INT. RAMON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Ramon sits on the floor, upset, half-heartedly building with

Legos, while his parents argue in the KITCHEN. His father

MANUELO is a stocky, muscular man. INTERCUT between the two

areas. This is a modest, well-kept apartment. Off the kitchen,

religious candles burn on a shelf above a washing machine.

ON RAMON, looking far from happy at the moment.

EXT. RIVER EAST SCHOOL - DAY

Rachel steps off a city bus, carrying her violin. She passes

two sixth-grade boys and a girl.

Rachel turns to them.

She proudly continues on, then sees Roberta walking towards

the school and catches up to her.

Roberta stops and looks at her.

Roberta gives her a big hug.

INT. CPE 1 - MUSIC ROOM - DAY

ON THE BEGINNER'S CLASS, including Ramon, as they play

"Lightly Row." Roberta walks around, making corrections as

she addresses the students. She doesn't see Justin poking

Ramon with his bow; Ramon swats the bow away and glares at

his nemesis. Roberta moves some of Shandra's braids away

from the violin.

INT. RAMON'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

SCREECHING comes from Ramon's room as he practices "Lightly

Row." His brothers, PEDRO (18) and ERNESTO (17), cringe as

they try to watch T.V. Ernesto gives up and puts on his

Walkman; Pedro's ready to break the violin. Concepcion listens

patiently as she folds laundry, but even she winces.

INTERCUT RAMON - He plays with pride, eyes on the music taped

to the wall.

INT. CPE 1 - MUSIC ROOM - DAY (A FEW MONTHS LATER)

ON RAMON, his improved playing showing that time has passed.

WIDER - the beginner's class plays "Lightly Row."

JUSTIN is struggling more than the other students. Roberta

plays along with the class, eyeing each student.

Vanessa enters the front door without her violin.

Vanessa pouts and exits. Roberta moves to ROSARIO, a Puerto

Rican girl.

She pulls a clipper from her pocket and swiftly clips them.

MYESHA nervously glances at her own nails.

She moves to Ramon and corrects his bowing position.

As Roberta walks on to the next student, Justin purposely

knocks over Ramon's music stand.

EXT. CPE 1 - DAY

As Roberta heads for her car, she sees Vanessa being helped

into a car by her FATHER, his suit wrinkled and tie loosened.

There's SNOW on the ground.

Roberta leans into the car window.

Mr. Klein's eyes tear up and he quickly wipes them.

She looks through her book bag, takes out a piece of music

and gives it to her.

Vanessa nods, clutching the piece of music. Roberta and Mr.

Klein exchange a look. She touches his arm, then walks off.

INT. RAMON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Ramon, holding his bow and violin, crosses to his father

who's watching a baseball game on T.V.

Ramon exits, hurt. Concepcion watches from the side, and

crosses to her husband.

He shows no response, and she exits. Manuelo ponders what

she said.

EXT. CPE 1 ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY (MORNING)

Roberta approaches the school on a winter morning. She smiles

as she sees Vanessa get out of her MOTHER'S car with her

violin. Roberta nears the front door and finds Isabel and

some teachers huddled in conversation. A few students are

crying.

INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY

The beginners sit on the floor and rosin their bows. A few

chat, but it's quieter than usual, except for RAMON who is

"blessing" kids with his violin bow.

Roberta enters slowly. She looks very shaken up. She takes

note of what Ramon is doing, and overhears Toussaint and

Shandra in mid-conversation.

Roberta gently tells Ramon to sit, and then she sits down on

a child-sized chair in front of them.

Myesha takes this in, looking sad.

Roberta watches him.

INT. RAMON'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN AREA - DAY

Concepcion cooks chicken and Pedro sets the table, whistling

along to Ramon's O.S. violin playing "We Shall Overcome."

There's a KNOCK on the door. Concepcion answers it, revealing

Roberta.

Roberta enters.

Concepcion shakes her head no.

INT. RAMON'S ROOM - DAY

Ramon is still playing violin as Concepcion and Roberta enter.

When he sees Roberta he straightens up even more.

He nods. Concepcion touches his head, then exits.

Ramon smiles, pleased with himself.

Ramon looks away from her, upset.

Ramon runs his fingers along his bow.

Roberta touches Ramon's back.

They laugh together, then Ramon looks sad again.

Ramon's eyes get teary. Roberta quietly leaves the room.

EXT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - ESTABLISHING - DAY (SPRING)

INT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Roberta brings in the mail, looking curiously at a manila

envelope with a return address from the NY REVIEW OF BOOKS.

She opens it, looks inside, then pours out a batch of other

letters onto the table. They're addressed to BOX HOLDER 127.

She opens one, reads it, then rushes to an INTERCOM.

INT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - MOMENTS LATER

Nick and Lexi stand by the table, opposite Roberta -- with

the incriminating pile of letters between them.

They thought she'd never ask.

They beam with pride. Roberta looks at them, mortified.

The boys nod, disappointed, and she exits. They look at each

other with glum expressions.

INT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Roberta lies on the couch, reading the personal ad letters.

She tosses one aside, then opens another.

INSERT

The letter is designed like a newspaper with a headline that

reads: JOURNALISM PROFESSOR DAN PAXTON ANSWERS PERSONAL AD;

HOPES RUN HIGH BEAUTIFUL MUSICIAN WILL CALL FOR A DATE!

BACK TO SCENE

Roberta can't help but be charmed.

INT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Roberta, Nick and Lexi play Haydn's "Trio #13" together on

their respective instruments. We sense that this is a special

family ritual. They play throughout their conversation:

They play for a few beats.

The DOORBELL rings and Roberta jumps up, bolting into the

bathroom down the hall.

Lexi and Nick exchange a smile, then Lexi crosses to the

door and opens it.

INT. DOORWAY - CONTINUOUS

Standing in the doorway is a man in casual college professor

attire. He's nice-looking, but no Prince Charming. He shakes

Lexi's hand and smiles warmly.

Lexi shows him in.

INT. ROBERTA'S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

IN THE MIRROR - Roberta takes a last look at herself,

wondering if he'll find her attractive. She touches her hair,

adjusts her dress, then takes a deep breath as she builds up

her courage.

INT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Roberta enters the living room where Dan is chatting with

Nick and Lexi. Dan sees her and is instantly smitten.

She smiles, blushing, and avoids eye contact with her sons

who are trying really hard not to laugh. As she and Dan start

to exit:

INT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

CLOSE ON CLOCK

It reads 12:30.

WIDER - Nick and Lexi play a video game on the TV screen.

O.S., there's the SOUND OF A CAR. They race to the window.

They stare out the window intently.

INT. DAN'S CAR - NIGHT

Dan pulls his car up in front of Roberta's house. Beside

him, Roberta holds a program from a Lincoln Center concert.

Roberta's tense, but Dan seems relaxed and centered in his

attraction to her.

They both laugh, then smile at each other. An awkward beat:

will he or won't he? Dan leans in to kiss her, and Roberta

turns away, uncertain.

A beat. Roberta feels badly about rejecting him.

Roberta cracks up. Dan smiles at her.

INT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

Roberta enters. The boys are back to their video game,

covering that they've been spying on her.

Nick looks disappointed.

She starts heading upstairs.

INT. CPE 1 - MUSIC ROOM - DAY

THE BLACKBOARD reads: SPRING CONCERT IN 10 DAYS! PRACTICE

PRACTICE PRACTICE!

Roberta rushes in, frazzled, not noticing at first that the

beginners are very quiet -- and that most don't have violins.

She puts her stuff down, then looks at the kids.

EXT. HALLWAY - DAY

Janet and Dennis talk outside Janet's office. Roberta storms

over to them. Janet looks at her, alarmed.

Roberta takes this in, momentarily speechless. In the b.g.,

the beginners slip into the hall to watch.

Roberta looks at him, then back to Janet.

They leave Dennis standing there, looking as if he's had his

face slapped.

INT. JANET WILLIAMS' OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Roberta's fury starts to give way to grief. She looks terribly

wounded. Janet looks at her helplessly.

A beat, and Roberta exits.

EXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY

Roberta's dazed and in pain as she walks through the crowds

of children, oblivious to kids calling her name and waving.

INT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - DAY (LATE AFTERNOON)

Nick and Lexi enter the darkened house, chatting as Nick

wheels in the bike and Lexi bounces a basketball. They turn

on a light to reveal

EXT. STREETS - DAY (LATE AFTERNOON)

Roberta, Nick and Lexi walk Allegra in their neighborhood.

Roberta looks worn out.

Lexi moves to comfort her.

Roberta and Lexi look at Nick, baffled as to the relevance

of the question.

A beat as she realizes what she's just said. The boys look

at her and the three of them stop walking.

INT. ROBERTA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Roberta frantically searches through her purse, then crosses

to a hall closet and quickly checks the pockets of her coats

and jackets.

She feels inside a jacket pocket, then finds it: DOROTHEA'S

BUSINESS CARD.

EXT. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - ESTABLISHING - DAY

INT. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY - DEPT. OF JOURNALISM - DAY

FOLLOW DAN PAXTON as he walks down the hall towards his office

and sees a strange silver object on the floor in front of

his office door. He picks it up.

AT THE NEW YORK TIMES?

BACK TO SCENE

Dan lifts up the foil to reveal a large piece of LASAGNA.

INT. CPE 1 AUDITORIUM - THE CONCERT - STAGE - NIGHT

SEVENTY-FIVE KIDS play "We Shall Overcome" and it's incredibly

moving. Nick's on cello, Lexi plays piano. ROBERTA proudly

leads the children. At the side of the stage, we see DOROTHEA

photographing the concert. THE CAMERA PANS THE AUDIENCE of

teary-eyed parents, many of them with CAM CORDERS. We FIND

Ramon's family. Manuelo is riverted by his son's playing,

and he starts to cry. Concepcion knows this without looking.

She takes his hand.

ANGLE - JANET stands along the side and her eyes start to

fill with tears. She tries to stay composed, then discreetly

exits the auditorium.

The song ends and the audience APPLAUDS, rising from their

seats, including ASSUNTA (now 65), next to ISABEL and DAN.

Someone remains seated: a REPORTER (40's), sitting beside

Dan and taking notes.

The STUDENTS bow, then point to Roberta who bows and takes

the stage. She gestures for people to sit. A beginner student

brings her flowers. Roberta kisses her, then approaches the

mike.

The parents stand and applaud. We see the REPORTER writing

quickly. Dorothea snaps more pictures. Roberta extends an

arm towards the kids, directing the applause at them. Ramon

gives her a thumbs up.

INT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

ROBERTA is vacuuming the living room while Assunta dusts.

Extra chairs are set up in the living room in preparation

for a meeting. The doorbell RINGS.

FOLLOW ASSUNTA to the DOOR. She opens it, revealing JANET,

who's carrying two bags of groceries. Assunta's demeanor

instantly cools when she sees her. In the b.g. Roberta sees

Janet and turns off the vacuum cleaner.

Janet briskly walks into THE LIVING ROOM, puts the grocery

bags down on a table, and begins to take things out of them.

Roberta watches her, mystified.

Roberta watches Janet for a beat, then addresses Assunta.

Assunta hesitates for a beat, then gets the dog and exits.

Janet continues unpacking the bags as if there's nothing

unusual about her being there. Cheeses, crackers, bread,

salads, fruit, paper plates, napkins, etc. She sees Roberta's

confused expression.

She holds up two wedges of cheese.

Roberta crosses into the kitchen and returns with a cutting

board and a knife.

She pulls out an Entenmann's blackout cake.

Roberta continues to stare in amazement at Janet.

Roberta smiles. Janet holds up a baguette.

Janet hands her the bread. A beat as the two women exchange

a private smile, then return to their respective tasks.

INT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

There's a crowd of PARENTS assembled in Roberta's front room,

talking at once, yelling out ideas, including CONCEPCION,

BEVERLY WILSON (Shandra's mom), MR. ADAMS (Black) and MRS.

ADAMS (Puerto Rican), the parents of James (from Roberta's

first year) and Simon. DOROTHEA, JANET, ISABEL are also there;

ASSUNTA is keeping tabs on the refreshments.

Disappointed grumblings.

A beat as people take this in.

Some people laugh but we see the anxiety on Roberta's face.

This gets people's attention.

The DOORBELL RINGS and Roberta crosses to get it. DAN enters,

holding copies of the NY POST, the DAILY NEWS, and a couple

of other papers. Each paper has been opened to a specific

page.

Roberta grabs the top one -- the POST -- opened to page 5.

INSERT

The page has a photo of Roberta at the Spring Concert, and a

large article headlined A VIOLIN TEACHER FIGHTS BACK.

INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY

Lots of chaos as a TELEVISION NEWS CREW sets up. Roberta

tries futilely to get the beginners to pay attention to her.

Dennis storms in.

The kids quiet down and watch them argue. A CAMERA GUY starts

shooting the argument and Dennis sees him.

She points to the kids. They're silent, waiting to see if

Roberta got through to him. A beat.

A beat and he exits. Roberta takes a deep breath, then turns

back to the kids who are watching her, impressed.

INT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

ON THE TV is the news segment: ROBERTA speaks to an unseen

interviewer.

It CUTS TO Roberta's beginners speaking to the interviewer.

WIDER - REVEAL Roberta, Lexi and Nick watching the TV.

INT. ARNOLD STEINHARDT AND DOROTHEA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

ON TV - THE SAME NEWS SEGMENT, ANOTHER SOUND BITE

WIDER - REVEAL a comfortable Upper East Side apartment and

DOROTHEA watching T.V. while ARNOLD practices violin. There's

FRAMED PHOTOGRAPHY on the walls, signed by Dorothea.

The look on her face tells him it's more than he bargained

for.

INT. SERIES OF SHOTS - DAY

1. Arnold Steinhardt speaks on the phone. His Roladex is

open to the name ITZHAK PERLMAN. In the b.g., Dorothea tensely

waits to hear if Itzhak Perlman will say yes.

2. Parents, Roberta, Nick and Lexi hang "FIDDLEFEST CONCERT"

posters around their neighborhood, announcing a concert at

THE 92ND STREET Y with ARNOLD STEINHARDT, ITZHAK PERLMAN and

STUDENTS FROM THE EAST HARLEM VIOLIN PROGRAM.

and Carlos' mom and dad -- stuff envelopes with INVITATIONS

to "FIDDLEFEST" and accompanying LETTERS and TICKET ORDER

FORMS. Roberta and Dorothea open envelopes with filled-out

TICKET ORDER FORMS and CHECKS. They stack the checks in a

pile, address return envelopes and place FIDDLEFEST TICKETS

inside them.

INT. MUSIC ROOM - DAY

Thirty-three excited kids from Roberta's different classes

chat, tune their violins, rosin their bows. The students

include Carlos, Stephanie, Amanda, Kenny, Rachel, Simon,

Ramon, Vanessa, and Shandra. Roberta enters the room, full

of energy, and addresses them as she heads to the front.

The students give her their attention.

She nods to Rachel who starts handing out sheets of music.

Ramon looks through his music sheets.

The kids read the contracts. Carlos' eyes widen.

The kids look sobered by this.

Lots of grumbling: "Say what?" "No way!" "Before school?"

I'ma be sleepwalking!"

ANOTHER ANGLE - Two young men and two young women walk in,

carrying violins. We realize from the scar that one is NAEEM

(20), now a strikingly handsome man, over six feet tall.

With him is DE SEAN (19), a short guy with dreadlocks, looking

more like a rapper than a violinist. GUADALUPE (19), walking

with a cane, is now a beautiful young woman, her long braid

pinned up. The fourth is a reserved Puerto Rican woman (20).

She hugs her, then looks closely at the other woman.

The woman snaps her fingers and smiles. Roberta laughs and

embraces her, then turns to the students.

INT. RAMON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Ramon's father carefully reads the violin contract while

Ramon and Concepcion anxiously watch. He stops to look up a

word in the English-Spanish dictionary beside him. Ramon and

his mom are squirming. Manuelo nods as he finishes reading,

then SIGNS the contract. Ramon breaks into a smile, throws

his little arms around his Papa and kisses him.

EXT. RIVER EAST - DAY

School's letting out; Carlos' sister exits, carrying Carlos'

violin. A few beats later, Carlos quickly exits, checking

his watch. He sees his LOS LEONES teammates standing in a

group, and tries to bypass them without being noticed, but

they spot him.

A beat.

He dashes off, a barrage of Spanish and English curses behind

him, and crosses to his sister, waiting for him DOWN THE

STREET. He takes the violin from her and carries it himself.

INT. CPE MUSIC ROOM - DAY

The Fiddlefest kids, including Carlos, Vanessa, Shandra,

Ramon, Stephanie, Amanda, Kenny, Simon, Thomas, De Sean and

Guadalupe practice Bach's "Minuet One," Roberta leading them

and giving direction. They're playing badly.

Rachel plays as well, but walks around the room making

corrections. It's early morning, and the kids look half-

asleep.

They play a few more bars and still sound pretty bad.

Some kids laugh, including Stephanie.

Vanessa yawns and Roberta sees her. Uh-oh.

INT. ARNOLD AND DOROTHEA'S APARTMENT - DAY

Dorothea opens the door for Roberta who just charges in,

agitated, without even saying hello. We sense that Dorothea

too, is troubled by something.

Roberta looks at her, aghast.

They both sink into the couch, completely undone by this.

INT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

The Fiddlefest kids are crammed into Roberta's house,

(including De Sean, Guadalupe, Ramon, Vanessa, Shandra,

Carlos, Thomas, Stephanie, Amanda, Kenny, and Simon),

rehearsing "Orange Blossom Special." They play badly. Rachel

helps Roberta correct students.

The kids look at each other, daunted.

Roberta looks at her, and then notices the despondent looks

on many of the kids' faces.

No one raises a hand. Roberta takes this in.

INT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - KITCHEN - DAY

It's early morning. Lexi cooks breakfast while Nick and

Roberta look at scribbled-on, marked-up lists.

They all look depressed. Lexi places an equally depressing-

looking stack of pancakes on the table. There's a BANGING on

the door, startling everyone.

Nick opens the door and Dorothea rushes in, out of breath,

talking a mile a minute.

Dorothea grins from ear to ear, Nick and Lexi whoop and

holler, and all wait for Roberta to jump up and down for joy --

but she looks stricken.

INT. CARNEGIE HALL - DAY

CLOSE ON THE CEILING OF CARNEGIE HALL, revolving slowly.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL THIS IS ROBERTA'S POV

She stands on the empty stage, gazing at the ceiling as she

slowly turns around. She's holding her violin case. She looks

at the UPPER BALCONIES -- THE LOWER BALCONIES -- THE ORCHESTRA

SEATS. Her footsteps echo as she walks towards the front of

the stage, then stops.

CLOSE ON ROBERTA

We can see her imagining the audience on the night of the

concert. She can't believe her eyes. A beat, and she looks

around to make sure she's alone. She takes out her violin,

takes a deep breath as she looks out towards her "audience,"

then starts to play the second violin part of the Bach Double

Concerto. Suddenly, there's the SOUND of a stage door opening.

Roberta stops.

Roberta turns to see ISAAC STERN approaching her. She's

completely flustered.

Roberta takes this in, relating it to her own struggle.

Isaac nods, then touches her shoulder.

EXT. SIDEWALK CAFE, UPPER WEST SIDE - DAY

Roberta pours nervous energy into her cappuccino, adding

cinnamon, chocolate, and sugar, stirring loudly. Dan sits

across from her, observing.

He offers her a forkful of some decadent-looking chocolate

cake, but she shakes her head.

She takes this in, looks at him gratefully and puts her hand

over his. He strokes her hand.

Roberta looks at him with trepidation. Dan takes another

forkful of his cake.

Roberta laughs. Dan smiles, glad he got her to lighten up.

EXT. CPE 1 - DAY (EARLY MORNING)

The Fiddlefest kids (including Ramon, Shandra, Vanessa, De

Sean, Naeem, Guadalupe, Lucy, Simon, Stephanie, Amanda and

Kenny -- but RACHEL is absent) stand outside the locked school

gate, waiting for Roberta. Some of the kids have their violins

out of the cases, tuning them.

Kids laugh.

A few kids start playing "CAN-CAN." It catches on, and more

of them join in. PASSERSBY stop to listen, and some drop

change into the open cases. RAMON and a couple of other kids

grin at this.

CARLOS steps in front of the kids as he plays, and begins an

uncanny imitation of Roberta:

The kids crack up, but a few spot ROBERTA heading quickly up

the street. Carlos is oblivious to this -- and no one signals

him that Roberta's watching.

Carlos senses a presence and turns to see Roberta. A tense

beat as he awaits her reaction.

Carlos freezes.

Roberta nods, and addresses the kids as she unlocks the gate.

The kids start filing in. Rachel comes up the street and

catches up to Roberta.

Roberta sees how distressed Rachel looks.

Rachel shakes her head no, then starts to cry a little.

She hands Roberta her violin.

Rachel looks anguished. Roberta moves closer and touches her

arm.

Roberta looks at her, pained, then hugs her. Rachel quickly

kisses Roberta goodbye and exits. Roberta watches her.

INT. CPE 1 - MUSIC ROOM - A LITTLE LATER

Roberta leads De Sean, Naeem, Guadalupe, Lucy, Stephanie,

Thomas, Carlos, Erica and Nicholas in the Bach Double

Concerto. The other kids watch. Roberta's on the edge of

hysteria. She signals the players to stop.

The kids say "the world's greatest violinists" along with

her -- they've obviously been hearing this a lot. Roberta

glares at them.

She stops, takes a breath.

All the kids nod. A few beats.

She crosses to take a look at her music, and the kids exchange

looks that say, "Oh shit. What did we just promise?"

REHEARSAL MONTAGE - SERIES OF SHOTS - DAY

1. Carlos practices violin against the fence around River

East School. In the b. g., his buddies make fun of him.

2. Shandra practices in a school stairwell, ignoring a boy

who pulls one of her braids as he passes by.

3. Stephanie practices at a bus stop, her eyes closed, then

looks up and realizes she's just missed her bus.

4. Ramon practices in his living room, his father watching

attentively, then helping him lift the violin higher.

5. Vanessa practices in a crowded school hallway, frustrated

as kids keep bumping into her.

6. Roberta, in her nightgown, practices in front of her

refrigerator in the middle of the night.

INT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - DAY (LATE AFTERNOON)

Pandemonium. Nick and Lexi, both in tuxes, are doing several

tasks at once while Roberta, in a simple black velvet dress

and stockinged feet, tries to put on her makeup but keeps

poking her head out of the bathroom, giving orders. Allegra

BARKS outside the back door.

ASSUNTA descends the staircase, dressed in a formal dress.

She holds a small jewelry box and heads for the bathroom.

Roberta sticks her head out and picks the earrings. Assunta

enters the small bathroom to work on her own makeup.

A beat.

Nick rolls his eyes and runs upstairs while Lexi organizes

things by the door: Nick's cello, Roberta's papers, extra

violins. Roberta rushes out of the bathroom, adjusting the

earrings. She starts compulsively straightening the house.

Nick comes running down the stairs with the violins and stares

in disbelief at Roberta fluffing a couch pillow.

He throws the pillow onto the couch. Roberta heads upstairs.

INT. CARLOS' ROOM - DAY

IN THE MIRROR - Carlos adjusts his tuxedo. We see the

reflection of his baseball bat, glove and trophies in the

room behind him.

INT. GUADALUPE'S ROOM - DAY

Guadalupe's mom pins up her braid, then steps back to look

at her daughter, radiant in a floral gown. Her mom starts to

cry.

INT. SHANDRA'S ROOM - DAY

Beverly puts rhinestone-studded barrettes in Shandra's hair.

INT. RAMON'S ROOM - DAY

ON RAMON - He's in a sharp black suit and looks very dapper.

WIDER - Manuelo and Concepcion stand back to admire him,

then Manuelo straightens Ramon's tie, brimming with pride

over his son.

INT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - FRONT ROOM - DAY

Nick and Assunta look towards the stairs. Roberta comes

running down.

She turns around, revealing a RIP on the back of the dress,

next to the zipper. The DOORBELL RINGS.

EXT. ROBERTA'S BROWNSTONE - DAY

Roberta, Assunta and the boys step outside, amazed to see a

STRETCH LIMOUSINE double-parked in front, a CHAUFFEUR waiting.

Roberta's open-mouthed. She leads her entourage towards the

limo. THE NEIGHBORS come out of their houses to watch. Some

lean out windows, gawking. Ad libs... "Who's that?" "It's

the Violin Lady!" LAWRENCE, dressed in a tux, gives Lexi a

high sign.

The chauffeur helps Roberta and Assunta into the limo while

Nick and Lexi start to load the instruments into the trunk.

INT. LIMOUSINE - CONTINUOUS

Roberta sits down beside Assunta and turns around so Assunta

can mend the tear in her dress. Assunta partially unzips the

dress and starts stitching it from the inside.

Assunta stitches, remembering, and smiles.

Roberta contemplates this. A beat.

Her last stitch finished, Assunta rips the needle from the

thread.

EXT. CARNEGIE HALL - ESTABLISHING - DUSK

INT. CARNEGIE HALL - BACK STAGE - NIGHT

The kids and their parents are practically boiling over with

excitement. Last minute kisses, violin tunings, and clothing

adjustments take place throughout the room.

The boys are in suits or tuxes, the girls in velvet or

flowered dresses, some with bows in their hair, some with

their hair up in buns. Roberta tries to take a head count,

Dorothea confers with a stage manager, Assunta fixes a boy's

tie, and Janet helps one girl with her hair, stopping in the

middle to button the back of another girl's dress.

Janet looks at her, concerned.

ANGLE - Roberta sees MRS. ADISA enter the room with Naeem.

The two women walk towards each other and embrace. As they

start to chat, Roberta suddenly sees someone and excuses

herself: BRIAN is walking towards her, wearing a tux. They

smile at each other, but Roberta's clearly a bit shaken to

see him. They're not quite sure how to greet each other --

he takes her hand, and then kisses her on the cheek.

A beat.

INT. CARNEGIE HALL - BACKSTAGE WINGS AREA - NIGHT

Guadalupe shyly approaches Itzhak Perlman, her mother behind

her, silently encouraging her.

He turns around.

He smiles at her and they shake hands.

As Guadalupe introduces him to her mother, CARLOS approaches.

Itzhak Perlman laughs.

INT. CARNEGIE HALL - BACK STAGE - NIGHT

Roberta talks to Janet with a worried expression.

A Carnegie Hall staff person in a suit enters.

The room electrifies with nerves.

VANESSA

rushes into the room with her father. She's out of breath,

her stocking has a big run in it, and she's in tears.

The boys rush over to the extra violins and look to find the

right size.

Roberta comforts her and Janet moves in.

ANGLE - DAN enters with a bouquet of long-stemmed red roses.

He's in a tux and looks very handsome. He crosses to Roberta,

hands her the flowers, and they hug.

INT. CARNEGIE HALL - NIGHT

The hall is filling to capacity as people take their seats,

the room buzzing with voices.

INT. CARNEGIE HALL - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

The CARNEGIE HALL staff person enters.

The tension in the room shoots sky high.

INT. CARNEGIE HALL - STAGE - PODIUM - NIGHT

Janet stands onstage and addresses the audience.

INT. CARNEGIE HALL - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

In the b.g. we hear the audience APPLAUDING Janet. Roberta

holds up her hands to quiet down the anxious students.

They become quiet.

The kids breathe.

She pats her heart.

INT. CARNEGIE HALL - BACKSTAGE CORRIDOR - NIGHT

The kids head out towards the stage, the APPLAUSE getting

louder as they get closer.

INT. CARNEGIE HALL - STAGE - NIGHT

CRANE SHOT of the children on stage, in their positions.

REVERSE SHOT - FOUR FILLED BALCONIES

BACK TO THE STAGE

Some of the kids look awestruck by the audience; one subtly

waves hi to her family. Roberta walks out to APPLAUSE. She

bows to the audience, turns to the kids, signals them with a

slight nod and the BACH MINUET ONE begins. We've heard it in

all phases, and now it is flawless.

PAN the STUDENTS watching her: VANESSA, wearing a corsage;

SIMON in his red bow tie; SHANDRA in black velvet with pearls;

NAEEM standing proud and tall, DE SEAN in dreadlocks and a

tux; RAMON playing from his heart...

INT. CARNEGIE HALL - BACK STAGE - CONTINUOUS

Isaac Stern, Itzhak Perlman, Michael Tree, Arnold Steinhardt,

Diane Monroe, Karen Briggs and Mark O'Connor wait back stage,

chatting and listening to the kids.

INT. CARNEGIE HALL - THE STAGE - MOMENTS LATER

The students finish MINUET ONE. There's an exquisite moment

of silence, then APPLAUSE.

INT. CARNEGIE HALL - THE STAGE - LATER

Country fiddler MARK O'CONNOR plays ORANGE BLOSSOM SPECIAL

with the kids. He improvises, surprising them as his violin

makes the sound of a TRAIN moving through a tunnel.

RAMON smiles, awed by this -- but he remains calm and

professional.

INT. CARNEGIE HALL - BACK STAGE CORRIDOR - LATER

As the guest violinists head for the stage, we hear their

names over a mike, mixed with APPLAUSE:

INT. CARNEGIE HALL - STAGE - MOMENTS LATER

CRANE SHOT of the six guest violinists on stage for the Grand

Finale, each one sharing a music stand with a student. Roberta

nods, and they begin THE BACH DOUBLE CONCERTO. She turns to

face the audience as she joins them.

MOVE IN AND PAN the performers and students: NAAEM shares a

stand with ARNOLD STEINHARDT; ISAAC STERN stands and plays

with GUADALUPE, sitting beside him; ITZHAK PERLMAN sits and

plays next to CARLOS, standing beside him; MICHAEL TREE plays

beside DE SEAN; DIANE MONROE plays beside LUCY; KAREN BRIGGS

plays beside THOMAS, and MARK O'CONNOR plays beside STEPHANIE.

NICK plays cello; LEXI plays the piano behind them; and,

playing with her own solo music stand, ROBERTA.

Their expressions are serious and passionate, broken by

occasional smiles lighting on faces: Isaac Stern... Lucy...

Carlos... Itzhak Perlman... Diane Monroe... De Sean.

The song finishes and the APPLAUSE begins. The OTHER

FIDDLEFEST PLAYERS come out from back stage, RAMON in front,

and join the rest. More applause. The CAMERA PULLS BACK TO

INCLUDE the audience facing the stage, then REVERSES to show

the audience standing in the orchestra and balconies.

We see the students' PARENTS; JANET, ISABEL and their

families; ASSUNTA, LAWRENCE and DOROTHEA; DAN; CONCEPCION,

MANUELO and their sons; BRIAN; and DENNIS -- even he can't

stop himself from applauding.

BACK AGAIN to the stage where the students and guest

violinists bow... and MOVE IN CLOSER on ROBERTA in her moment

of triumph.

INT. CARNEGIE HALL - STAGE - PODIUM - MOMENTS LATER

Roberta addresses the audience. Her voice is strong but softer

around the edges; she is a woman in a state of grace.

The APPLAUSE is DEAFENING, then slowly diminishes as we:

INT. CPE 1 - MUSIC CLASSROOM - DAY

Roberta addresses ten first-graders sitting in a circle on

the floor. She points to the horsehair on her bow.

Roberta and the kids laugh.

The boy smiles and shakes his head.

One girl raises her hand with urgency.

The boy points to the frog of the bow and Roberta smiles.

And as she continues her lesson, her voice recedes and we:

CRAWL:

Roberta Guaspari lives in East Harlem with her daughter Sofia,

whom she adopted from El Salvador. Nick is a professional

cellist in a graduate music program, and Alexi has been

accepted to medical school.

Roberta teaches violin to approximately 150 students a year

in three East Harlem elementary schools. The East Harlem

Violin Program, however, is still not funded by the New York

City Board of Education.

The money raised from Fiddlefest supported Roberta's violin

program for three years. Roberta and Opus 118 continue their

fundraising efforts to keep the program alive.
