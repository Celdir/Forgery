EXT. PITTSBURGH, PA - TWILIGHT

A beautiful blue-collar city approaching nightfall. Bridges.

Rivers. Churches. The working class poetry of the `Burgh.

EXT. ST. MARY'S CHURCH - SAME

PADDY CONLON (60) exits the doors of a run-down church

holding a 12-STEP BOOK. He is followed by a cluster of other

PEOPLE in the program and says his goodbyes.

EXT./INT. RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD/`75 OLDS - LATER

Paddy grips the steering wheel with labor-calloused hands and

drives over the P.J. McArdle Bridge and up a winding hill. He

listens to "MOBY DICK" on tape as the last piece of daylight

bleeds away. With rosary beads swaying from his rear view,

Paddy turns and eases the Olds past row houses in a blue-

collar neighborhood high above the city.

EXT. HOUSE - SAME

TOMMY CONLON (28), hard miles on a handsome face, sits on the

stoop of an old row house in a wool watch cap and winter

coat. A duffel bag is at his feet, a bottle of whiskey in a

brown bag in his hands. He reaches into his coat pocket, pops

a handful of prescription PILLS, and stares off into the

approaching night.

EXT. PADDY'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Paddy pulls up to the curb in front of the house, clicks off

the tape, kills the engine, and climbs out of the car. As he

approaches the stairs, Paddy sees Tommy. Can't believe his

eyes.

Tommy gives a drunken, crooked smile.

Father and son look at each other. It's obvious it's been a

long, long time. Tommy takes a bemused look down at the car.

Paddy grins uncomfortably. Lets the remark go and climbs the

stairs as Tommy reaches into his duffel bag and produces a

fresh BOTTLE of Jameson. He offers it to Paddy.

Paddy shakes his head. Tommy looks at him. Paddy Conlon not

drinking? What gives?

Paddy pats his son on the back and heads for the door as a

confused Tommy follows.

TITLE CARD: WARRIOR

INT. PADDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Paddy and Tommy walk through the front door. The house is

clean, yet all the furnishings are from the late 1970s. Tommy

stands in the den and looks around, breathing the old place

in, as Paddy makes his way into the kitchen.

The sound of glasses CLINKING in the kitchen as Tommy takes

off his watch cap and begins to look around his old home. He

glances down at a BIBLE on a table beside a weathered Barca

lounge chair.

Tommy takes another swig from his bottle and looks at a

series of old PHOTOGRAPHS lining the walls as Paddy walks

into the room carrying a coffee pot and saucers on an old

wicker tray. Tommy looks at him, incredulous.

Tommy shrugs. Takes another pull from his bottle and turns

back to the photos. He takes them in.

FRAMED PHOTO OF: 12-YEAR-OLD TOMMY, IN A WRESTLING UNIFORM

AND HOLDING A HUGE TROPHY, STANDING NEXT TO A YOUNGER PADDY,

WHO WEARS A TOWEL OVER HIS SHOULDER, CIRCA 1992.

FRAMED PHOTO OF: YOUNG PADDY AND A LOVELY, THIN WOMAN DANCING

AWKWARDLY AT A WEDDING RECEPTION, CIRCA 1974.

FRAMED PHOTO OF: THE SAME WOMAN, SHIELDING HER EYES FROM THE

SUN, STANDING NEXT TO TWO YOUNG BOYS, AGED 4 AND 6, AT THE

KENNYWOOD AMUSEMENT PARK, CIRCA 1984.

FRAMED PHOTO OF: 8-YEAR-OLD TOMMY, A YOUNGER PADDY, AND A 10-

YEAR-OLD BOY STANDING IN FRONT OF A BLAST FURNACE WEARING

HARD HATS CIRCA 1988.

Tommy's eyes are drawn to another picture, likely taken at a

mall photography studio, of a MAN AND WOMAN (late 20s) POSING

WITH A YOUNG GIRL (2). The man looks like the second boy in

the other photos. His brother BRENDAN.

Tommy's face registers surprise.

Tommy turns back to the photos and looks at another one of

the woman. Obviously his MOTHER. He puts it down, glances at

the bible, then stares hard at Paddy.

Paddy sips his coffee. Says nothing. Tommy keeps pressing.

Tommy plops himself into a recliner. Glances at the coffee

table, where a stack of classic books on tape sits. CRIME AND

PUNISHMENT. THE SUN ALSO RISES. THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO.

MOBY DICK.

Paddy chokes up. Tommy looks at him. Closes his eyes.

An overwhelmed Paddy sips his coffee and looks at Tommy, who

is fading. The pills are kicking in. He tries to open his

eyes, but it's no use, and after a few moments he's out.

Paddy glances down, where some pills have fallen out of

Tommy's pocket and scattered on the rug. He watches his son.

Relieved and heartbroken at the same time.

EXT. BRENDAN AND TESS' HOME, PHILADELPHIA - DAY

A chaotic birthday party in the back yard of a middle-class

home in the suburbs of Philly. A CLUSTER OF 5-YEAR OLDS run

about, some whacking at a pinata hanging from a tree, some

whizzing down a large blow-up slide, some getting their faces

painted by a make-up artist dressed like a GYPSY.

TESS CONLON (29) bounces around the yard, multi-tasking like

a champion and filming the proceedings with a VIDEO CAMERA.

She trains the camera on BRENDAN CONLON (30), who sits in a

lawn chair in a scarf, hat, and women's make-up.

THROUGH VIDEO CAMERA LENS: TWO GIRLS, EMILY (5), WHO WEARS A

BIRTHDAY GIRL CROWN, AND ROSIE (3), MIMIC THE MAKE-UP WOMAN

AND APPLY MASCARA AND BLUSH TO BRENDAN.

Tess laughs. Brendan looks at her with a "Help me out here"

expression.

The make-over ends abruptly at the mention of "presents."

Emily, little sister in tow, runs over to a table filled with

gifts as PARENTS and CHILDREN gather around.

Brendan gets out of the lawn chair and follows Tess over to

the gift table. Amidst all the presents is one BOX, covered

in pink wrapping paper, that is far larger than the rest.

Tess turns the video camera toward Brendan again. He couldn't

look more ridiculous. And he obviously didn't clear the gift

with his wife. He grins at her as she lowers the camera.

Brendan smiles in his make-up. Kisses his wife.

EXT. BRENDAN AND TESS' HOME - LATE AFTERNOON

The remnants of the birthday party lay strewn across the

lawn. Tess, in a cocktail waitress outfit, says goodbye to

her MOM and the kids, who play on the swing set.

She walks toward the garage and enters to find Brendan

pressing free weights on an old bench.

INT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

Brendan continues to lift as Tess rushes in and tosses a bag

of garbage in the bin. A deep CUT, hidden earlier by the make-

up, is visible on his cheek.

Brendan kisses Tess. Looks at her outfit.

Tess smiles flirtatiously and and heads for the car.

INT. COLT'S PITTSBURGH FIGHT CLUB - DAY

A big, old-school warehouse, where a handful of GUYS whale

away at MMA punching dummies and roll around on sweat-

saturated mats. Sun slants through a dirty, industrial

skylight. A no frills kind of gym.

Behind the front counter, FENROY (20s) rolls hand wraps and

watches ESPN's "MMA LIVE" on a laptop.

ON COMPUTER SCREEN: ESPN ANCHOR JON ANIK INTERVIEWS PROMOTER

J.J. RILEY, AND PUNKASS AND SKYSKRAPE FROM TAPOUT.

As Fenroy watches them talk about the upcoming Sparta

tournament, Tommy walks into the gym, surveys the room with

curiosity, and approaches the front desk.

Fenroy goes back to his computer. Tommy stands there. Notices

a Sparta POSTER on the wall reading: "THE WAR ON THE SHORE.

ATLANTIC CITY, JULY 2-3. BIGGEST WINNER TAKE ALL IN MMA

HISTORY!"

Fenroy grabs a pencil and an index card and puts them on the

counter in front of Tommy.

INT. CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM, PHILADELPHIA - DAY

Brendan stands in a classroom, surrounded by high school

STUDENTS wearing safety goggles and raising cain. A block of

wood sits wedged in a vice, and a student, TITO, stands over

it with a Louisville slugger in his hands as his classmates

CHEER him on.

Brendan, sleeves rolled up and a bemused look on his face,

watches as Tito brings the bat down on the wood. As it CRACKS

in half, the other students cheer wildly. Tito smiles and

leans the bat against a blackboard with "NEWTON'S 2nd LAW OF

MOTION" printed on it.

As Tito high-fives his way back through the group, things

settle down and the kids take their seats.

A room full of affirmatives, with the cocky voice of NASH, a

skinny white kid in a Flyers jersey, standing out.

A black student, STEPHON, looks up from his desk.

Brendan looks toward the classroom door, where two red-and-

white clad CHEERLEADERS are peering in, then walks over to

KC, a blonde cheerleader seated in his class. She is working

a Blackberry and doesn't notice him approaching.

Brendan stands directly in front of her desk. She quickly

shoves the Blackberry under a stack of books.

He turns and shoos away the two cheerleaders peering in the

window.

The class busts on KC as Brendan walks back to his desk and

sits on top of it. It's clear from the vibe in the room that

he's a very popular teacher. Then the BELL rings.

INT. COLT'S PITTSBURGH FIGHT CLUB - DAY

Fenroy sits at the front desk and looks at his computer.

Watches "MMA LIVE" and another feature on the big upcoming

Sparta tournament.

Tommy, wearing a wife beater and old gray sweats, works a bag

and eyeballs an ENTOURAGE that surrounds a ring. Inside, a

heavily-muscled FIGHTER with a mohawk, MAD DOG GRIMES (30s),

is putting a beating on his SPARRING PARTNER. The obsequious

nature of the entourage makes it clear that Mad Dog is

somebody important.

In the ring, the sparring partner takes a vicious spinning

back fist to the chin, goes down in a heap, and doesn't get

up. COLT BOYD (40s), clearly in charge, throws up his hands

as Mad Dog laughs.

Colt climbs into the ring and looks at the fallen fighter.

Glances at Mad Dog.

Colt turns around and looks at Tommy. As does Mad Dog, who

smiles down at him from inside the ring.

Tommy walks back to his bag. Mad Dog smiles. Looks at Tommy's

outfit.

Tommy stops. Walks back to the ring as Fenroy approaches.

Colt looks at Mad Dog. What do you think? The Mohawked

fighter looks at Tommy. Shrugs. It's his funeral.

Colt studies Tommy. Sees he's serious. Gives in.

Colt Boyd waves Tommy into the ring. Mad Dog's entourage

starts whispering amongst themselves. Snickering at what lays

in wait for Tommy as the fallen sparring partner is helped

out of the ring.

A TRAINER tapes Tommy's hands and gives him some MMA gloves.

He slips them on, then at the sound of a BUZZER he starts

moving toward Mad Dog, who smirks at Tommy's aggression and

then starts circling him. Tommy nails him with a front kick

to the chest. Grimes staggers back and shakes it off.

He crouches down, gets serious. He throws a right. Blocked. A

leg kick. Blocked. Tommy snaps his head with a jab. Then he

does it again. And again. Then he DECKS HIM with a hard

right, sending Mad Dog to the canvas to the shock of his

entourage and Colt Boyd.

Fenroy looks up from his post and walks over to the ring.

Within moments everyone in the gym stops what they're doing

and watches as Tommy grabs the back of Mad Dog's head, hauls

it down, and launches knee after knee into his face.

Tommy starts throwing Mad Dog around like a rag doll,

striking him with vicious punches and kicks, as Fenroy pulls

out his CELL PHONE and starts filming the action. As Colt

Boyd screams at Mad Dog to cover up, Tommy shoves him against

the ropes and blasts away.

Tommy continues to pound. It's a full-fledged beating going

on in there. Finally, he crushes Mad Dog with a vicious left

hook and sends him sprawling through the ropes, UNCONSCIOUS.

SILENCE in the gym. What the hell just happened here? The

entourage rushes to Mad Dog's aid, but he's out cold. Colt

Boyd looks on in disbelief as Tommy walks across the ring and

approaches him.

INT. FIRST UNION BANK - DAY

Brendan sits in a chair across from loan officer DAN TAYLOR

(40s). They're mid-meeting and going over documents.

Taylor looks at Brendan. Takes him a second to remember.

Brendan glares at him.

Brendan gets up and storms out of the office.

INT. PADDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Paddy sits in front of the TV and watches an old VIDEO TAPE

of a wrestling tournament. The bottom of the screen reads:

1994 PA STATE WRESTLING FINALS. CONLON VS. SPEERY.

ON TV SCREEN: 14-YEAR-OLD TOMMY DOMINATES AN OPPONENT.

ON TV SCREEN: A YOUNGER PADDY SHOUTS INSTRUCTIONS AS TOMMY

CRUSHES HIS OPPONENT.

ON TV SCREEN: TOMMY PINS HIS OPPONENT AND LEAPS OFF THE MAT

IN JUBILATION.

As Paddy watches, the DOORBELL RINGS. He makes his way to the

door as the tape continues to play.

Paddy opens the door to find Colt Boyd standing on the stoop.

Paddy registers the name "Riordan."

Colt looks at Paddy. Jams his hands in his pockets. He's

obviously waiting for an invite inside. It doesn't come.

Paddy closes the door on a frustrated Colt.

INT. BRENDAN'S CAR - NIGHT

Brendan drives down the road on the outskirts of town and

talks on his cell.

EXT. THE TENDER TRAP - NIGHT

Brendan pulls into the parking lot of the local strip club. A

white TENT is set up outside, and the parking lot is

overflowing with cars. Something big going on.

INT. TENDER TRAP TENT - SAME

Aluminum bleachers are set up around a ring, where TWO

AMATEUR FIGHTERS go at it under a bank of sodium lights.

Hundreds of rowdy LOCALS swill beer and BOO lustily when the

action slows.

INT. TENDER TRAP RING - LATER

MIKE MOORE (20s), a FIGHTER sporting sleeves of demonic ink,

paces in his corner as a cluster of BIKERS cheer him on from

ringside. An ANNOUNCER walks to the center of the ring with a

cordless microphone.

Some hollers from the crowd.

Lo and behold, there's a shirtless Brendan standing in the

corner of the ring wearing a pair of shorts. On his right

shoulder, an elaborate TATTOO of the CONLON FAMILY CREST.

The REFEREE enters the ring and stands between Brendan and

Mike Moore.

Brendan reaches out to touch gloves with Mike Moore, but his

opponent snubs him and storms back to his corner. He means

business. Brendan, looking less sure of himself, retreats to

his corner.

The bikers raise hell as the BELL sounds. Moore comes out

bombing. Brendan dodges a couple of wild haymakers, then gets

caught in the side of the head with a right hand. He stumbles

back into the ropes and Moore presses into him, swatting at

him with his huge hands.

Brendan absorbs the blows, ducks down, grabs Moore by the

legs, lifts him, and dumps him on the mat with a resounding

THUD. Obviously bull strong and with tremendous punching

skills, Brendan sits on his opponent's chest and starts

raining down shots, banging and banging, pulverizing his face

and body.

It's a full on ass-whooping going on in there until finally,

mercifully, the referee stops the butchery amidst a mixture

of CHEERS from the crowd and BOOS from the bikers.

A winded Brendan walks to his corner, touches the side of his

head, wipes a small amount of blood on his shorts, and climbs

out of the ring, where a PROMOTER approaches.

INT. BRENDAN AND TESS' HOME - BEDROOM - NIGHT

The bedroom door opens and Brendan creeps through the room

and into the bathroom.

INT. BRENDAN AND TESS' HOME - BATHROOM - SAME

It's dark, except for the moonlight glowing through the

window. An exhausted Brendan takes off his shirt and begins

washing his badly SWOLLEN FACE. Then the door opens, and Tess

shuffles in.

Brendan doesn't answer. Tess slowly wakes up. As she does,

she gets a look at his face.

Tess studies his face. Brendan looks at her. Reaches into his

pocket and hands her $500 in cash.

She looks at him. Looks at the money. Puts it together.

Tess can't believe what she's hearing.

Tess reaches up and touches his battered face. Calms herself

down. Embraces her husband.

EXT. TRACKSIDE DINER - MORNING

A steady rain tumbles down over an old-school diner in the

shadow of the railroad tracks.

INT. DINER - SAME

Paddy sits in a booth and takes a sip of coffee. Judging by

the spent sugar packets and the half-eaten club sandwich,

he's been there a while.

The front door swings open and Tommy enters wearing his watch

cap and sweats. He makes his way over to the booth and plops

himself down. It's clear something's on his mind but he

doesn't say anything. Finally, Paddy engages him.

Tommy grabs a fry off Paddy's plate.

Paddy tries to tether it down, but he's happy. Tommy looks at

him sternly.

Tommy looks at him. Grins for the first time.

Paddy calmly sips his coffee, then leans in on Tommy with a

stern look. The old lion's got a few teeth left.

Tommy gives him a hard look, but the old man doesn't shy

away.

Tommy considers, then reaches into his pocket and slides two

bottles across the table.

Tommy looks at him. Fishes another bottle out of his pocket

and flips it on the table.

The two men stare at each other. Tommy looks furious, but he

doesn't get up. A silent, tenuous agreement is reached.

INT. CENTRAL HIGH HALLWAY - MORNING

Brendan, his face BRUISED badly from the night before, walks

down the hallway toward his classroom. STUDENTS watch him as

he passes and whisper.

INT. CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - SAME

The class is filled with the kind of BUZZING that can only

rise off a major rumor. Tito, Nash, KC, and Stephon discuss.

Brendan enters the room. The kids look at him. Holy shit.

It's true.

Brendan puts his bag down on his desk and faces the class. He

is not amused by the murmuring in there.

The kids pipe down. Then Tito speaks up.

Before Brendan can answer, he sees PRINCIPAL JOE ZITO (50s)

gesturing to him through the window of the classroom. Zito

taps his watch and points. Come see me after class.

INT. PRINCIPAL ZITO'S OFFICE - LATER

Zito, puffy faced, hair getting thinner by the hour, hangs up

his phone as Brendan pokes his head in. Zito waves him in.

Eyeballs the marks on his face.

Zito stands up and runs his hands across his head.

Zito looks at Brendan. Puzzled.

Zito sits back down.

Zito sees the SUPERINTENDENT enter the foyer outside his

office. He's looking none too pleased.

Brendan and Joe stand up. Zito can't tether down a slight

grin.

Brendan nods. Joe shakes his head. Impressed.

INT. BRENDAN AND TESS' HOME - KID'S PLAYROOM - NIGHT

Brendan sits in a miniature playroom off the kid's bedroom,

putting glue on the leg of a TOY PIANO. Tess enters the

bedroom, where the girls sleep, and leans into the playroom.

They speak in whispers.

Tess crouches down and enters the tiny room. She sits on the

floor.

Tess sighs. They sit in silence. There are no easy solutions.

Finally, Brendan speaks up.

Brendan looks at his wife.

Tess sits quietly. Knows they have limited options.

They look at each other. No choice. This is the plan.

INT. TOMMY'S ROOM - PRE-DAWN

Paddy climbs the stairs with a POSTER BOARD tucked under his

arm and a cup of coffee in his hands. He enters Tommy's room,

which is also a monument to the past. Old wrestling TROPHIES,

Steelers' posters, and an EMPTY SECOND BED that obviously

once belonged to Brendan.

Paddy places the cup of coffee on the night stand as Tommy

stirs, then sits on the empty bed and unrolls the poster.

It's yellowed with age and covered with a boy's handwriting.

ON BOARD: THEOGENES 1415 WINS. NO LOSSES. TOMMY CONLON 315

WINS. NO LOSSES. ALSO, A 1994 NEWSPAPER CLIPPING READING

"PRODIGY WINS STATE CHAMPIONSHIP," AND ABOVE IT, GOALS: 1998,

COLLEGE, PENN STATE. 2000, SUMMER OLYMPICS, GOLD MEDAL.

Tommy says nothing. Not a nostalgic bone in his body. The

dreams on that poster are long gone.

Paddy's stung but covers it amiably.

EXT. AL ADAD AIR BASE, RAMADI, IRAQ - DAY

Marine base camp in the middle of the Iraqi desert. Blackhawk

HELICOPTERS floating in the sky. MARINES rushing about.

INT. MARINES COMMUNICATIONS TENT, RAMADI, IRAQ - SAME

MARINES of various rank huddle around a computer screen,

fired up about something they're watching.

LANCE CORPORAL MARK BRADFORD (20s) walks up to see what the

commotion is all about.

ON COMPUTER SCREEN: YOU TUBE VIDEO OF THE CELL PHONE FOOTAGE

FENROY TOOK OF TOMMY BEATING UP ON MAD DOG GRIMES. THE

MOHAWKED FIGHTER IS CRUSHED BY THE LEFT HOOK AND FALLS

BETWEEN THE ROPES.

Bradford stares at the screen, his eyes widening as the

Marines raise hell about the footage.

One of the Marines rewinds the video. Bradford looks at the

image in disbelief, then races out of the tent.

EXT. BRAVO COMPANY COMPOUND - CONTINUOUS

Bradford hustles outside into the searing sunlight.

INT. TENT - CONTINUOUS

Bradford enters a barracks, where Private "AV" SIMERS (20s)

plays cards with other MARINES.

AV drops his cards, rushes to his bunk, pulls out a steel

container loaded with VIDEOTAPES and sifts through it. They

are labeled by day and month. AV finds what he's looking for,

loads it into the camera, and hits PLAY.

ON VIDEO SCREEN: A CHAOTIC FIRE FIGHT IN THE DEAD OF NIGHT.

MUZZLE FLASHES. TRACER LIGHTS. MAYHEM. THE CAMERA FOCUSES ON

A FLIPPED TANK, HALF OF IT SUBMERGED IN WATER. A MARINE, HEAD

SHAVED BUT ALMOST CERTAINLY TOMMY, SUDDENLY APPEARS AND

CLIMBS ON TOP OF THE TANK, REACHING FOR THE HATCH.

AV holds the "Pause" button down as Bradford looks at the

screen in disbelief. It's definitely Tommy.

INT. CAMPANA FIGHTING SYSTEM - DAY

In a top MMA gym, FRANK CAMPANA (40s) works in a ring with

Brazilian superstar MARCO SANTOS (20s) and other FIGHTERS.

The sound of CLASSICAL MUSIC fills the air.

As Frank teaches, Brendan walks in the door. The great

trainer notices him and walks over.

They embrace warmly.

The two head for the offices at the back of the gym.

INT. FRANK'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

They walk into an office filled with PHOTOS of Frank in his

fighting days. He was obviously somebody. The walls are also

adorned with SPARTA posters. Frank reaches into a mini-

fridge, pulling out a couple bottles of Vitamin water. He

hands one to Brendan and motions for him to sit down.

Frank looks at his old friend. Smiles warmly.

Frank considers what he's hearing.

Frank starts smiling. Leans back in his seat. Then he sees

Brendan is not smiling with him.

Brendan smiles.

The two friends share a laugh.

Brendan stands up. Shakes Frank's hand.

Brendan puts his dukes up and smiles as Frank shakes his

head.

EXT. BRENDAN AND TESS'S HOME - NIGHT

Brendan pulls into the driveway of his modest home, gets out

of his Camry, and looks to the street, where Paddy stands

outside his Olds, leaning on the passenger door.

Brendan carries a gym bag and wears work out clothes. He's

clearly not happy to see Paddy, who stands there,

uncomfortable and heavy hearted in the light of the street

lamp.

Paddy shakes his head, unsure what he means.

Paddy holds his hands out, palms down.

Paddy's words set Brendan off. A side of him we haven't seen

before emerges. He approaches his father fiercely.

Paddy nods. Casts his eyes down in shame.

Brendan looks at the reformed Paddy, a measure of sympathy on

his face. Then he heads for the house.

As he's halfway through the yard, Paddy calls out.

Brendan stops in his tracks. He turns and looks at his Dad.

Brendan walks closer. Incredulous.

Paddy nods.

Brendan looks at him. Considers.

Paddy frowns.

Brendan starts to walk away, then turns around again.

Paddy looks toward the house, where Emily, Rosie, and Tess

stand at the door. Paddy waves.

Brendan keeps walking. Opens his door to step inside.

Brendan closes the door, leaving the heartbroken Paddy alone

in the yard.

EXT. COLT'S PITTSBURGH FIGHT CLUB - DAY

Tommy, his hoodie drenched, jogs up the sidewalk and enters

the gym.

INT. COLT'S PITTSBURGH FIGHT CLUB - CONTINUOUS

ON COMPUTER SCREEN: JON ANIK AT THE MMA LIVE DESK. A PHOTO OF

KOBA, A BAD, BALD RUSSIAN FIGHTER, IS ALSO ON THE SCREEN.

Mad Dog Grimes trains furiously under the watchful eye of

Colt Boyd. When Colt sees Tommy approaching, he turns his

attention away from Mad Dog.

Tommy heads up the stairs toward the locker room without

acknowledging Colt, though he does allow a small smile to

crease his lips.

INT. LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Tommy pulls a crumpled PIECE OF PAPER out of a beat-up wallet

and begins dumping change into an old pay phone on the wall.

INT. PILAR FERNANDEZ'S HOUSE, EL PASO, TEXAS - SAME

More of a shack than a house. PILAR FERNANDEZ (20s), a pretty

but tired Mexican girl, watches a grainy TV with a six-year-

old BOY and a four-year-old GIRL as the phone RINGS. The

table it sits on has a FRAMED PICTURE of Tommy and another

MARINE on it, their arms around each other in the Iraqi

desert.

him out. His skills are improving.

EXT. 33RD STREET TIRE YARD - MORNING

In an expansive and grim scrap yard along the river bank,

Tommy somehow manages to lift and flip old long-haul rig

EXT. P.J. MCARDLE BRIDGE, PITTSBURGH - MORNING

INT. CAMPANA FIGHTING SYSTEM - DAY

Brendan and Marco grapple. They're evenly matched. Frank

An AMBULANCE pulls in front of the ER.

INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE - LATER

A sorely dejected Frank walks through an underground parking

garage with Brendan.

Frank heads off through the lot. Brendan reaches his car,

stops, considers. Calls out to Frank while jogging toward

him.

Brendan looks hopefully at Frank, who shakes his head as he

begins to open the door of his `70 Ford Bronco.

Frank looks at him. Sees how serious Brendan is.

Frank breaks. Smiles. How can he say no?

Brendan grins and walks back toward his car.

EXT. BRENDAN AND TESS'S HOME - MORNING

Brendan pulls a garbage bin down to the curb as Tess walks

out of the house talking on a cordless PHONE.

Brendan hangs up the phone. Looks at Tess.

A look of serious concern crosses Tess's face. She puts her

hands on her hips.

Brendan doesn't say anything. Knows she's right. And that

he's about to get laid into.

No response from Tess, who has tears in her eyes.

Tess looks at her husband. Wants to support him, but can't.

Tess starts walking back toward the house. She marches up the

lawn without turning back, leaving Brendan, alone, in front

of his house. He looks at the toys strewn across the yard.

Surveys the neighborhood. He's going to Sparta.

EXT. ATLANTIC CITY - DAY

Sunlight pours down on the crowded beaches, hotels, and

boardwalks of AC. Thousands of PEOPLE jam the outside of the

majestic Boardwalk Hall. It seems as if everyone on earth is

in town.

BILLBOARDS heralding the arrival of the SPARTA tournament are

everywhere. Ceremonial Fourth of July banners hang, cars jam

Ocean Avenue, early FIREWORKS pop. The buzz is electric. The

greatest show on earth has hit the shore.

EXT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA - SAME

LIMOUSINES pull up in front of the Boardwalk Hall rotunda as

"Mad Dog" Grimes, Orlando "Midnight" Le, Karl "The Dane"

Kruller, and other fighters make their way down a long red

carpet swarming with FANS.

In the middle of it all is J.J. Riley, greeting press and

guests and running the show as the Tapout crew, Colt Boyd,

and others mill about and talk shop. Announcers BRYAN CALLEN

(40s) and SAM SHERIDAN (30s) corral J.J. for an interview.

The great and mighty KOBA emerges from a white stretch limo,

trailed by his ENTOURAGE of tough-looking RUSSIANS.

FLASHBULBS pop. REPORTERS swarm. It looks like a movie

premiere out there and Koba's the star.

INT. BOARDWALK HALL LOBBY - SAME

As WORKERS set up for the press conference and camera crews

stake out their territory, Tommy and Paddy hug the corner of

the room and wait. Not in their element at all. Moments

later, Brendan comes walking through the doors.

As he moves through the crowded room, Brendan and Tommy make

eye contact.

They haven't seen each other in 14 years, and judging by the

looks on their faces they certainly didn't expect to see each

other today. Paddy is just as shocked.

Brendan begins to inch toward Tommy, but is intercepted by

Frank, who was caught up in the media storm outside.

Brendan looks past Frank. Tommy has risen and headed toward

the exit, trailed by Paddy, who calls after him.

EXT. RESORTS HOTEL AND CASINO - TWILIGHT

The sun descends over the boardwalks and hotels of Atlantic

City, and sinks into the sea.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - SAME

Paddy sits on a couch thumbing through a Sparta program and

looks proudly at a PICTURE of Brendan. He listen to "Moby

Dick" on his headphones as a TV plays in the foreground.

ON TV SCREEN: LOCAL NEW JERSEY NEWS ANCHOR MICHELLE MOONEY

SPEAKS OVER IMAGES OF THE RED CARPET EVENT AND PRESS

CONFERENCE.

ON TV SCREEN: A PICTURE OF TOMMY APPEARS ON THE SCREEN NEXT

TO A PICTURE OF LANCE CORPORAL MARK BRADFORD.

Paddy notices the picture of Tommy. Puts down the program and

takes his headphones off.

Paddy stares at the screen intently.

ON TV SCREEN: MARK BRADFORD PEERS INTO A HAND-HELD CAMERA IN

IRAQ AND SPEAKS. HE FIGHT BACK TEARS.

ON TV SCREEN: BRADFORD HAS TO COMPOSE HIMSELF.

Tommy walks into the room from the door of an adjoining suite

and stares at the TV.

Paddy is dumbfounded and looks at Tommy, who glances at him

and back at the TV before heading toward the door.

ON TV SCREEN: THE CAMERA PUSHES IN ON BRADFORD'S FACE. HE

SPEAKS DIRECTLY TO TOMMY.

ON SCREEN: BACK TO THE NEWS STUDIO, AND THE PHOTO OF TOMMY.

ON SCREEN: THE GRAINY FOOTAGE SEEN EARLIER IN THE MARINE

BARRACKS OF TOMMY AND THE SUBMERGED TANK.

Then the phone RINGS. Paddy grabs it.

EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

Brendan walks on the beach as the waves of the Atlantic Ocean

lap at the shoreline. Boats bob on the water. Stray bottle

rockets trace through the night sky.

In the distance, the NEON LIGHTS of an amusement park flash

and zip. Behind Brendan, the big casinos loom, advertisements

for Sparta filling their BILLBOARDS.

Brendan continues walking, then spots Tommy coming toward

him. The brothers make eye contact. Stop. Then approach each

other warily.

Brendan looks at Tommy. Sees how rigid he is. A long silence.

Finally Brendan cuts right to it.

Brendan reaches into his pocket and removes a recent

Christmas PHOTO of Tess, Emily, and Rosie from his wallet.

Tommy glances at the photo impasssively and hands it back.

With that, Tommy walks briskly away from Brendan and up the

beach. His brother runs after him.

No response from Tommy. He's a wall.

Tommy smirks. Walks away again.

The words hit Brendan hard.

Tommy and Brendan are right in each other's faces. Standing

on the knife's edge of violence. They hold the stare down for

a few long seconds, like two fighters about to go to war.

Tommy and Brendan look at each other with burning intensity.

Too much baggage and both too much and nothing left to say.

Finally, Tommy turns and walks on down the beach.

EXT. CENTRAL HIGH, PHILADELPHIA - DAY

Sunny day. And a nearly abandoned school parking lot.

INT. OUTER OFFICE - DAY

Nash, Tito, and KC wait outside the Principal's office. It's

quiet and aside from one SECRETARY, there's no one around.

After a moment, Stephon comes walking in, and they all stand

up and head into the Principal's office.

INT. PRINCIPAL ZITO'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

The kids walk in. Zito looks up and shakes his head.

All four of them laugh nervously. Working their way up to

something.

Zito turns and heads back to his desk. The kids, dejected,

leave the office and walk off down the hallway.

EXT. BOARDWALK HALL - NIGHT

The Goodyear BLIMP, "SPARTA IS HERE" blinking on it, floats

over Atlantic City. FIREWORKS explode majestically above

Boardwalk Hall and fall into the sea, where hundreds of boats

bob, televisions tuned to Sparta visible from many of them.

THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE cram the beach and boardwalk, crane their

necks toward the sky, and watch the stunning pyrotechnics. In

the streets, limos line up on Ocean Avenue. Even from a

distance, the excitement and energy are palpable.

Enormous electronic BILLBOARDS flash outside of the giant

seaside casinos. On one, Koba hangs off the side of a ferris

wheel and swats at smaller fighters buzzing around him in a

replication of the iconic "King Kong" movie scene.

INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA - SAME

Play by play announcer Sam Sheridan and color analyst Bryan

Callen stand cageside. The arena is packed to capacity and

buzzing with anticipation.

INT. TOMMY'S LOCKER ROOM - SAME

Tommy lays on the ground near the showers, collecting his

thoughts. As Paddy watches a TV monitor showing Callen and

Sheridan, an OFFICIAL pokes his head into the locker room.

INT. COLT'S PITTSBURGH FIGHT CLUB - LATER

Fenroy and a group of FIGHTERS gather around a TV in the gym.

A very fired up group.

ON TV SCREEN: A FURIOUS TOMMY MAKES HIS WAY THROUGH THE CRUSH

OF INSANE SPECTATORS, PADDY DUCKING ALONG AT HIS SIDE. LIGHTS

RICOCHET CHAOTICALLY AROUND THE ARENA.

INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA - SAME

As Tommy makes his way toward the cage and the strobe lights

sweep over nearly 15,000 SCREAMING FANS, not one of them

sitting.

Tommy continues to storm toward the cage with a furious and

focused look on his face. He seems to want nothing to do with

Paddy. Training is over. It's time to fight.

Tommy stands outside the cage and has Vaseline applied to his

face. He looks like he's ready to murder someone.

INT. LOCKER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Frank holds mitts for Brendan as a TV plays.

ON TV SCREEN: REFEREE JOSH ROSENTHAL (30s) GIVES INSTRUCTIONS

TO TOMMY AND HIS OPPONENT, FRANCISCO BARBOSA (20s). THE

MUSCULAR BRAZILIAN DOESN'T HAVE A TRACE OF FEAR ON HIS FACE.

INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - SAME

Tommy and Barbosa face to face as JOSH ROSENTHAL instructs.

In the crowd, two sections of MARINES in full dress uniforms

wave flags and raise about as much hell as humanly possible

for Tommy, who returns to his corner. Paddy attempts to give

him some advice, but Tommy is not listening.

The bell rings. DING! And Tommy comes out fast and hard.

There will not be a take down. Tommy ducks a blow, then

levels Barbosa with a massive and brutal LEFT HOOK. The

Brazilian's head snaps sideways, his MOUTHPIECE goes flying,

and he does a face plant on to the canvas. It's over.

As the crowd erupts and Josh Rosenthal waves to Barbosa's

corner to get a medic in there, Tommy marches out of the cage

without waiting for an official announcement.

INT. COLT'S PITTSBURGH FIGHT CLUB - SAME

Fenroy and the boys fired up. They can't believe the

ferocious knockout they've just witnessed.

INT. BRENDAN'S LOCKER ROOM - SAME

The official pokes his head into the locker room where Frank

and a nervous Brendan sit alone.

On the TV monitor, Tommy's annihilating knockout of Francisco

Barbosa plays. Then, in the distance, the strains of

CLASSICAL MUSIC can be heard. Brendan looks at Frank, who

smiles and puts his hands on Brendan's shoulders.

He grabs the nervous Brendan's head between his hands.

INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

BUZZING in the crowd. Another fight close at hand.

Brendan and Frank walk down the tunnel toward the arena,

where Paddy is waiting, his All Access pass around his neck.

Brendan notices the old man as he approaches.

Brendan barely acknowledges Paddy and keeps walking. Frank

looks at Brendan with a "Who the hell is that?" expression.

As they approach the dark lights of the arena, Beethoven

continues to BOOM out over the loud speakers.

Brendan and Frank make their way through the crowd and toward

cageside, where Bryan Callen reaches beneath his seat.

Callen holds up a plastic bag with water and a GOLDFISH

inside.

Brendan gets greased up, then climbs into the cage.

INT. BRENDAN AND TESS'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - SAME

A nervous Tess sits at the table, failing to concentrate on

folding laundry. The TV in front of her is off, but she

glances at it anyway. In front of her sits a CELL PHONE. She

glances at it repeatedly.

INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - MOMENTS LATER

Brendan stands in the corner as his opponent, ORLANDO

"MIDNIGHT" LE climbs in, shoulders bulging and abs shredded.

Brendan stands in the corner and looks at the massive

Midnight Le. Frank smiles at him.

Brendan grins and looks out at the rabid crowd.

Josh Rosenthal waves the two fighters into the center of the

cage for instructions.

The fighters head to their corners and wait for the bell.

At the sound of the bell, "Midnight" Le comes out hard and

strong. He repeatedly KICKS Brendan in the leg and batters

him with STRIKES. His power is overwhelming Brendan.

INT. TOMMY'S LOCKER ROOM - SAME

Paddy stares at the TV monitor.

ON TV SCREEN: MIDNIGHT PICKS UP BRENDAN AND BODY SLAMS HIM.

Tommy lays on the rubdown table, his eyes closed. No interest

in Brendan's fight.

INT. PRINCIPAL ZITO'S LIVING ROOM - SAME

Joe Zito sits on a couch in his suburban home and watches

Brendan on TV. He's a nervous wreck.

INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - LATER

Frank exhorts Brendan from cageside, telling him to relax,

but it's no use. It's an unholy beating going in the cage.

INT. PRINCIPAL ZITO'S LIVING ROOM - SAME

Zito drinks a glass of Scotch.

ON TV SCREEN: MIDNIGHT POUNDING ON BRENDAN.

Zito leans forward. He looks as if he's going to have a heart

attack.

INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - SAME

Midnight Le takes Brendan to the ground. Brendan tries to

escape, but turns his back, allowing Midnight to sink in a

rear naked CHOKE. He puts the strangle hold on Brendan and

squeezes his neck with his enormous biceps.

Brendan tries to pry Midnight's hands off him. No use.

Midnight squeezes for all it's worth as Frank screams at

Brendan, imploring him not to tap.

Brendan is on the verge of going unconscious, but he refuses

to tap out. Then the HORN blows ending the round. The crowd

can't believe Brendan hung in there, and neither can Midnight

Le, who slams the canvas in frustration.

As Midnight walks back toward his angry TRAINER, who expected

him to finish Brendan early, the teacher heads toward a

smiling Frank.

Brendan grins at Frank's positive spin on things, then looks

across the cage at Midnight Le, who glares at Brendan.

INT. PRINCIPAL ZITO'S LIVING ROOM - LATER

The frazzled Zito continues to root for Brendan.

ON TV SCREEN: MORE OF THE SAME. MIDNIGHT ALL OVER BRENDAN.

INT. TOMMY'S LOCKER ROOM - SAME

An excited Paddy watches Brendan on the monitor.

INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - SAME

Midnight continues pounding on Brendan, but Brendan starts

giving back, working a few leg kicks of his own. He seems to

be gaining confidence. From cageside, Frank HOLLERS words of

encouragement as the battle continues.

Back and forth they go. Midnight rocks Brendan with a right

hand. Brendan recovers and fires back. Then Midnight shoots

in for a take down, but Brendan dodges him, reverses

position, and suddenly takes a shocked Midnight down to the

ground. The crowd is on its collective feet.

Brendan locks up Midnight's shoulder. Applies pressure. The

bigger fighter struggles to get free, but he seems to be

trapped. From cageside, Frank screams, instructing Brendan on

how to finish the move.

Midnight TAPS and the crowd EXPLODES. Shock and mayhem

throughout the arena.

INT. PRINCIPAL ZITO'S LIVING ROOM - SAME

Principal Zito leaps off his couch, SCREAMING in celebration.

ZITO'S WIFE (40s), drying dishes, pokes her head in the room

as the Principal pumps his fist over and over.

ON TV SCREEN: BRENDAN AND FRANK EMBRACING. CHAOS IN THE RING

AND MIDNIGHT ON THE GROUND IN UTTER DISBELIEF.

INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - SAME

Frank and Brendan embrace. The arena is BUZZING. Midnight

gets off the canvas, and Brendan approaches him and bows. The

dejected Midnight bows in return.

A jubilant Brendan raises his arms in victory. The crowd

responds to the gutsy underdog.

As the celebration continues, Callen looks at Sheridan and

shakes his head. Was he ever wrong.

INT. BRENDAN AND TESS'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - LATER

Tess sits on the couch, TV still off. Her phone BEEPS. She

grabs it quickly. A text reads: "I WON!!!!!!!!"

She starts dancing around the room, kissing her phone.

Tommy and Paddy sit and watch the monitor.

ON TV SCREEN: THE CROWD IN A FRENZY AS KOBA CLIMBS INTO THE

CAGE.

INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - MOMENTS LATER

At the sound of the BELL, Koba sprints across the ring and

delivers a flying kick to the chest of his already retreating

OPPONENT. He picks him up with incredible strength, then

SLAMS him into the ground and pounds his brains in. The whole

thing is over in under 10 seconds.

INT. BRENDAN'S LOCKER ROOM - SAME

Brendan and Frank stare at a monitor. They look worried.

ON TV SCREEN: KOBA's OPPONENT GETTING ATTENDED TO AFTER THE

BEATING BY THE MIGHTY RUSSIAN.

Brendan and Frank stand in the tunnel as the house lights go

down in the arena.

Paddy stands amidst the crowd in the tunnel and gives Brendan

a thumbs-up.

Brendan glares at him and marches toward the cage.

INT. BRENDAN AND TESS'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - LATER

Tess, now watching the fights on TV, stands in front of the

throw up.

KRULLER (30s), WHO POUNDS ON HIM WITHOUT MERCY.

INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - SAME

INT. BRENDAN AND TESS' HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME

Tess can barely watch the beating.

INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - MOMENTS LATER

Frank shouts instructions as Brendan and The Dane tangle

against the fence.

Brendan grabs Kruller and FLIPS him to the canvas. Then he

spins for an ARM BAR, a move similar to one seen earlier in

the smoker fights.

INT. PRINCIPAL ZITO'S LIVING ROOM - SAME

Zito, now joined by his wife. Both on the edge of the couch

and sucked into the action.

INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - SAME

Brendan twists Kruller's arm. He's got him in a terrible

position, much like Midnight. The Dane SQUIRMs. Looks for an

escape. It's not there. With Brendan applying tremendous

pressure to his arm, he TAPS.

INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA TUNNEL - SAME

Paddy watches from the tunnel as the crowd goes insane.

INT. BRENDAN AND TESS'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - SAME

Tess does a wild JIG in front of the TV.

INT. COLT'S PITTSBURGH FIGHT CLUB - LATER

Fenroy and the gang around the big screen again.

ON TV SCREEN: TOMMY WADING FURIOUSLY THROUGH THE CROWD, WHERE

A "TOMMY" CHANT HAS BEGUN.

INT. BOARDWALK HALL CAGE - MOMENTS LATER

Tommy climbs into the cage. A Mexican fighter, DIEGO SANTANA

(20s), is waiting for him. Josh Rosenthal points at both men.

The bell RINGS and Tommy goes right after Santana and starts

administering a beating. He bullies him into the cage and

starts raining BLOWS all over him.

INT. COLT'S PITTSBURGH FIGHT CLUB - SAME

The crowd raising cain for Tommy.

ON SCREEN: HURRICANE TOMMY POUNDS AWAY, THEN SLAMS SANTANA TO

THE GROUND AND BEATS HIM TO A PULP.

INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - SAME

Josh Rosenthal pulls Tommy off the brutalized Diego Santana

before he kills him. Once again, Tommy marches straight out

of the cage.

Tommy marches past Paddy again, then off through the crowd.

The arena is on its collective feet CHANTING "Tommy! Tommy!

Tommy!" As Paddy looks on and Tommy disappears into the

darkness of the tunnel, the sound of cheering fades.

EXT. BOARDWALK - DAWN

Dawn breaks over Atlantic City.

INT. CASINO FLOOR - SAME

A CLEANING WOMAN vacuums as an elevator door DINGS and opens.

Out comes Paddy. The casino is nearly empty, the only sounds

coming from the tinny RINGING of a handful of slot machines.

From a distance, Paddy spots Tommy sitting at the far end of

a bank of Triple 7 American Glory slot machines, mechanically

feeding the slot from a tray full of silver and pulling the

lever with a thousand-yard stare. Paddy approaches Tommy, who

doesn't acknowledge him.

Tommy feeds the machine and pulls. Says nothing. Paddy sits

down in front of a slot machine next to Tommy.

Paddy starts putting things together.

Tommy doesn't respond.

Paddy's shaken. He can't fathom the anger in Tommy, yet he

knows he's responsible. It's written all over him. Tears well

up in his eyes. They seem to make Tommy madder.

Tommy reaches down and picks up a plastic CUP made for

holding coins and dips it into his tray, filling it with

QUARTERS.

Tommy whips the bucket toward his father, splashing COINS

into his face. A stunned Paddy, tears streaming down his

face, walks off. A handful of late-night GAMBLERS look at

Tommy, who stares angrily ahead and bounces a quarter off his

slot machine as his destroyed father limps away.

EXT. ATLANTIC CITY - DAY

Fourth of July weekend in full swing down the Shore.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - SAME

Paddy staggers about in pajama bottoms and a stained V-neck,

clutching his Walkman and a bottle of WHISKEY. "Moby Dick"

plays from ear phones that are half on his head and half off.

LIQUOR BOTTLES are strewn everywhere. He has obviously fallen

off the wagon. Hard.

He staggers around the room, giving a fragmented soliloquy to

no audience.

Suddenly the adjoining door swings open. Tommy, hair

disheveled, looks in and sees Paddy's state. The old man

thrusts his hand up in the air and screams at Tommy.

Paddy staggers over and gets in Tommy's face, his own face

blotched and contorted. The old Paddy Conlon revealed. The

monster from the past.

There's no anger in Tommy. He simply walks toward the old man

and tries to pry the bottle out of his hand. As he struggles

to take it, the Walkman falls to the ground. Faint dialogue

is heard coming from the earphones.

The old man is running out of steam. He begins WEEPING.

Paddy wobbles, tears streaming down his face. Tommy looks at

him. The first time we've seen anything resembling compassion

on that relentless face of his. He HUGS his father and pries

the whiskey bottle from his hand

Tommy pulls his father back on to the bed. Puts his arms

around his chest and tries to quiet the old man. It's a

tender moment, and it seems as if Tommy is only able to

relate to the brutal, former version of the father he knew.

Tommy continues to hold his father as sunlight streams into

the room. The end of a very long night.

EXT. BOARDWALK HALL - NIGHT

A bigger, even more bombastic FIREWORKS display than before

explodes over Atlantic City. If it's possible, the CROWDS on

the beach and boardwalk have swelled. It seems as if the

entire east coast has descended on AC.

Outside Boardwalk Hall, the giant electronic BILLBOARD has a

new motif. Koba still swings mightily from the side of a

ferris wheel, but now Tommy, in a camouflage superhero

outfit, flies right toward him. On a collision course.

Mad Dog Grimes holds on to Tommy's cape, trying to slow him

down, and below the three of them, in miniature, is Brendan

holding a sling shot.

INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA - SAME

The crowd at a fever pitch. Two sections full of MARINES in

dress uniforms cheer insanely. So does an entire section of

GIRLS wearing camouflage tank tops and holding up signs

reading "TOMMY GIRLS." Everyone in the arena chants "Tommy!

Tommy! Tommy!" A cult hero has been born.

INT. COLT'S PITTSBURGH FIGHT CLUB - SAME

Colt's is packed. FIGHTERS. PEOPLE off the street. VETS in

fatigues. A bigger crowd than before.

ON TV SCREEN: TOMMY MARCHING TOWARD THE CAGE AND BEING

SERENADED BY THE MARINES.

INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA - SAME

The Marines are on their feet, singing "HALLS OF MONTEZUMA"

at the top of their lungs.

At cageside, Sheridan leans over to Callen, raising his voice

to be heard above the Marines.

Tommy climbs up the stairs and into the cage. He turns and

nods at the Marines.

INT. COLT'S PITTSBURGH FIGHT CLUB - LATER

The crowd at the gym both CHEERS and JEERS at the TV.

ON TV SCREEN: MAD DOG GRIMES, SUPREMELY CONFIDENT, CLIMBS

INTO THE CAGE AND GETS IN TOMMY'S FACE. HE HAS DYED HIS

MOHAWK CAMOUFLAGE COLORS TO MOCK TOMMY.

INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - SAME

Mad Dog and Tommy in a STARE DOWN as Josh Rosenthal attempts

to give them instructions. Unless Mad Dog's mother is in the

building, every single person in the Boardwalk Hall is

rooting for Tommy.

The Marines hoot and holler at Mad Dog as Josh Rosenthal goes

over his instructions with the two fighters.

In the center of the cage, Mad Dog is practically spitting in

Tommy's face. Tommy's eyelids droop. He could not be less

intimidated.

Callen and Sheridan look on as the two fighters retreat to

their corners. The anticipation in the arena is incredible.

Josh Rosenthal looks at Tommy and Mad Dog.

Tommy goes after Mad Dog like it's the last night on earth.

What Tommy did to him at Colt's Gym was an exercise in

restraint compared to what's happening in that cage.

Mad Dog is on his back and being pounded on. Tommy's rage is

shocking, even by his own brutal standards. From cageside,

Colt Boyd SCREAMS at Josh Rosenthal.

It's such a savage beating, so malicious, that Rosenthal has

to climb on Tommy's back to get him off of Mad Dog. If his

mother is indeed in the crowd, she couldn't recognize him

now. Beaten to an absolute pulp.

Tommy marches out of the cage and past Colt Boyd, Punkass,

and SkySkrape, who can't believe what they just witnessed.

Neither can anyone else at Boardwalk Hall. In the cage, a

MEDIC tends to Mad Dog.

EXT. STARLIGHT DRIVE-IN, PHILADELPHIA - LATER

"ODE TO JOY" is heard coming from distant speakers as ROWS OF

CARS line up at the entrance and pull into the lot.

Pull back to reveal an enormous, old drive-in movie theater

packed with a RAUCOUS CROWD. On the gigantic MOVIE SCREEN,

Brendan makes his way through the arena and into the cage. As

he does, CHEERS erupt in the parking lot. Stephon, Nash, KC,

Tito, and some of the other students from Brendan's class

root him on. They came up with a pretty good Plan B.

As the kids get fired up for the fight, they're joined by a

familiar face that emerges from the crowd. Joe Zito. Tito

shakes his hand. Smacks Stephon. Look who's here.

INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA - SAME

Brendan climbs into the cage to a major OVATION from the

crowd. They're completely on his side now.

Brendan stands in the corner. Frank leans over the railing of

the cage and smiles at him.

Buzzing in the arena. The lights about to go down for the

entrance of Koba. Before they do, Brendan looks up to see a

familiar face at cageside. Tess. He can't believe his eyes.

Brendan looks at his wife. She smiles broadly. Mouths the

words "I love you." Brendan grins. Kisses his glove and

presses it against the cage. As he does, the lights go out

inside the arena and ominous RUSSIAN MUSIC BLARES.

The crowd strains to get a look at the legend as he makes his

way toward the cage. Brendan watches. So does Frank. Tess

takes a quick glance at Koba, then looks away. She can't bear

it.

Brendan nods, then looks at Tess. Drawing strength. Frank

leans over the railing and taps fists with his fighter.

Finally, the creepy music subsides, and the great Russian

climbs into the cage. He's massive, and the crowd stares at

him like an exotic animal.

Josh Rosenthal calls Brendan and Koba to the center of the

cage. The Russian looks at Brendan with the cold,

dispassionate eyes of a killer. Brendan does his best to hold

his gaze.

Brendan retreats to his corner. Takes a deep breath.

Koba comes straight at Brendan. His speed and strength are

astonishing.

Franks screams at Brendan to keep his distance. Tess watches

through her fingers. And Koba keeps coming, snapping

Brendan's head back with a jab and bludgeoning him with an

uppercut to the chin. The Russian is doing whatever he wants

to Brendan. He slices him up with strikes. Bruises his legs

with kicks. Works him against the fence. Power slams him.

EXT. STARLIGHT DRIVE-IN - SAME

Thousands of people staring at the drive-in screen and you

can hear a pin drop. They're aghast. Zito can hardly look. KC

buries her head in Nash's chest.

ON MOVIE SCREEN: THE SLAUGHTER CONTINUES. HOW BRENDAN IS

TAKING IT IS ANYONE'S GUESS.

INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA - SAME

Koba gets Brendan in a BEAR HUG, lifts him off the ground,

carries him into the center of the ring like a sack of

laundry, and body SLAMS him on his back.

As Frank screams for Brendan to remain calm, a mortified Tess

watches. Mercifully, the HORN sounds, and Brendan survives

the round. He barely makes it back to his corner.

The minutes passes in no time. It's time to go again.

Koba comes right after Brendan, and it's soon more of the

same. Power slams. Brutal strikes. Brendan's face is carved

up and battered. He tries to go for a take down, but Koba

snuffs it, then lifts Brendan off the mat again and carries

him through the air. Frank screams, but there's nothing he

can do. Brendan is brutally SLAMMED into the ground.

As Brendan writhes on the ground, Koba grabs him and slings

him against the fence like it's nothing. Brendan flies

through the air and RATTLES against the cage. Then Koba

climbs on top of him and starts whaling away. Tess can't even

watch it. Once again, just as Rosenthal is about to stop the

fight, the HORN sounds.

Brendan drags himself off the ground and limps to his stool.

Frank enters the cage. His usual positive attitude is gone.

He comes at Brendan with aggression instead.

Josh Rosenthal claps his hands. Frank takes his cue to leave,

but not before giving Brendan one last look. It's now or

never. Brendan looks across the cage at Koba. Steels himself.

Brendan comes out and meets Koba in the center of the cage,

but the Russian resumes his supremacy.

Koba roughs the battered Brendan up some more, but then

Brendan starts responding. Throws a couple effective leg

kicks. A decent punch or two.

EXT. STARLIGHT DRIVE-IN - MOMENTS LATER

The parking lot is quiet and tense. Zito and the kids stare

at the movie screen.

ON MOVIE SCREEN: KOBA PRESSES BRENDAN UP AGAINST THE CAGE AND

TRIES TO CHOKE HIM OUT.

INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - SAME

The Russian SQUEEZES away.

Frank screams at Brendan to stay calm. To wait for his

moment. Koba continues to squeeze. Brendan's face turns more

and more red. Finally, he grabs Koba's shorts, musters up all

the strength he has left, and TOSSES the Russian on his back,

freeing himself from the choke in the process.

Brendan jumps on Koba and attempts his own choke.

Koba shakes off Brendan's submission attempt and stands.

Brendan stands with him and they exchange a vicious round of

blows. Brendan's giving as good as he's getting.

Brendan snaps Koba's head back with a left, but the Russian

responds with a combination. Brendan stumbles backwards, and

Koba grabs him and tries to take him down. Brendan throws a

left ELBOW that connects with Koba's temple. The Russian is

momentarily STUNNED, long enough for Brendan to take him to

the ground and wrap his arms around Koba's KNEE.

Brendan wrenches his body for all it's worth. Frank pounds on

the apron of the cage.

The Russian tries to squirm away, but he can't. His face is

contorted in PAIN. The cageside OFFICIAL indicates there's

only 10 seconds left in the fight.

Four. Three. Koba struggles. Grimaces in agony. Brendan keeps

wrenching his knee. Two. He can't take it. One. He TAPS!

EXT. STARLIGHT DRIVE-IN - SAME

The drive-in crowd goes absolutely BERSERK. Tito leaps into

INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA - SAME

Tess stands on her seat, shrieking. Brendan climbs on top of

the railing and lifts his arms in the air, a look off shock

on his face. The arena goes bananas.

Pure bedlam in Boardwalk Hall. Frank going wild. Tess. The

TapouT crew. J.J. Riley. Just an extraordinary scene.

Finally, the noise fades away.

INT. BOARDWALK HALL PRESS AREA - LATER

J.J. Riley, the TapouT crew, and a few OFFICIALS stand over a

computer screen on press row. They wear headphones and

shocked expressions.

Riley and the others look at one another. They can't believe

what they're hearing.

EXT. STARLIGHT DRIVE-IN - SAME

Tito and the kids sit on the hoods of cars eating hot dogs

and waiting for the final fight. Joe Zito looks up at the

movie screen, where Bryan Callen makes an announcement.

ON MOVIE SCREEN: A SURPRISED CALLEN.

Stunned expressions from Zito, KC, Nash, Stephon, Tito, and

everyone at the Drive-In. The wild night has taken an

unexpected turn.

INT. BRENDAN'S LOCKER ROOM - SAME

Brendan, Frank, and Tess sit in the locker room. On the

monitor, Callen and Sheridan continue to discuss the

situation. Brendan has ice packs on his shoulders and knees

and his face is a mess after three brutal wars in 24 hours.

INT. TOMMY'S LOCKER ROOM - SAME

Tommy sits by himself in his locker room, the weight of the

world pulling his shoulders down. His black hoodie is over

his head. He couldn't be more alone.

EXT. RESORTS HOTEL AND CASINO - SAME

A sobered up Paddy runs out of the hotel and climbs into a

waiting taxi.

INT. BOARDWALK HALL - MOMENTS LATER

Brendan and Frank make the long walk down the tunnel and into

the arena. Unlike previous trips, there is no joy on their

faces. It's a grim march to the cage.

EXT. STARLIGHT DRIVE-IN - SAME

People stand on cars. Chairs. Each other's shoulders.

ON MOVIE SCREEN: THE BATTERED BRENDAN CONTINUES HIS WALK,

WADING THROUGH A CROWD THAT IS AS PUMPED AS HE IS SOMBER.

Tito, KC, Nash, Stephon, and the other students start

chanting "Mis-ter C! Mis-ter C! Mis-ter C!"

INT. TOMMY'S LOCKER ROOM - SAME

Tommy rises and walks toward the door.

INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA - CONTINUOUS

He marches out the door and into the bowels of the arena,

moving past MPS as he goes. His march is as grim as

Brendan's.

INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - SAME

Brendan and Frank embrace.

Brendan climbs into the cage as the house LIGHTS DIM. The

crowd is going bonkers. And they EXPLODE when Tommy appears

at the end of the tunnel with his hoodie up and begins his

march toward the cage.

The Marines shower him with cheers and "Hoo-ahs." The girls

scream. The rest of the audience stamps their feet and chants

his name. But he acknowledges no one, and the hard look on

his face never wavers.

INT. COLT'S PITTSBURGH FIGHT CLUB - MOMENTS LATER

Fenroy and the crew on the edge of their seats, all staring

at the big screen.

ON TV SCREEN: TOMMY GETTING GREASED UP AND CLIMBING INTO THE

CAGE.

INT. TAXI - SAME

A nervous Paddy sits in the back of the cab as the DRIVER

navigates through holiday traffic.

INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - SAME

And here it is. The two brothers face to face in the middle

of the ring, staring each other down. Tommy with his usual

controlled fire, Brendan intense, searching his brother's

eyes for some flicker of recognition.

As Rosenthal finishes his instructions, Brendan peers into

Tommy's empty corner.

Tommy turns without answering. All business. Brendan returns

to his corner. Looks at Tess. So much emotion on her face.

Tommy comes right after his brother. Just like with his

previous three opponents. A natural wrecking machine. Frank

screams at Brendan to stay calm, but Tommy is all over him,

POUNDING on him with savage intensity. As bad as the other

fights were for Brendan, this one is worse.

EXT. STARLIGHT DRIVE-IN - SAME

The crowd is tense and subdued. It's not going well.

ON MOVIE SCREEN: TOMMY KEEPS TATTOOING BRENDAN WITH HEAD

SHOTS. BEATS HIS BROTHER WITH MALICE. IT'S HARD TO WATCH.

INT. COLT'S PITTSBURGH FIGHT CLUB - SAME

Fenroy and company thoroughly enjoying themselves.

INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA - SAME

Tommy continues to batter Brendan, then he swoops in, picks

him up, and SLAMS his big brother into the ground. Then he

does it again. And again. And again.

Brendan, the wind knocked out of him, is on his back, trying

to protect himself from Tommy, who mounts him and starts

blasting away with a BLUR of lefts and rights. The only thing

that saves Brendan is the HORN. Which Tommy ignores, blasting

his brother with a brutal CHEAP SHOT to the jaw well after

the round had ended.

Brendan lays on the ground as Josh Rosenthal pulls Tommy off

him and admonishes him for the cheap shot. Tommy stares at

Brendan. You want more?

Frank runs into the cage with the stool and Brendan limps

over to him and sits down. Brendan stares at Tommy, who paces

in his corner like a caged animal.

Josh Rosenthal claps his hands. It's time. Frank glares at

him as he picks up the stool.

Tess sits uncomfortably in her chair. Her husband's face is a

mess. In front of her, Callen and Sheridan commiserate. J.J.,

the TapouT crew, and Colt Boyd look on. The electricity in

the crowd is greater than ever. They want a champion.

EXT. STARLIGHT DRIVE-IN - MOMENTS LATER

Very quiet at the Drive-In. It's tough for everyone to watch

what's happening to Brendan.

ON MOVIE SCREEN: ROUND TWO. A REPEAT OF ROUND ONE. TOMMY JUST

WHALING ON BRENDAN AND BRENDAN TRYING TO HANG ON FOR DEAR

LIFE.

INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA - SAME

The Marines in the crowd are all on their feet, screaming for

Tommy to end it. The chant starts up again. 15,000 strong.

"Tommy! Tommy! Tommy!" Frank tries to instruct Brendan, but

he can't hear him, and he's too overwhelmed.

Tommy presses Brendan against the cage and does the same

thing Koba did. He lifts him off the ground, carries him on a

dead run, and body SLAMS him so hard the cage shakes. Then

Tommy mounts him and starts pounding away again.

The HORN sounds ending the round, but this time it's Brendan

who pops up and pushes Tommy. Tommy shoves him back.

Rosenthal has to separate them as the crowd roars its

approval.

INT. COLT'S PITTSBURGH FIGHT CLUB - LATER

Fenroy and company watching the big screen.

ON TV SCREEN: ROUND THREE. MORE TOMMY DOMINATION, BUT BRENDAN

IS SOMEHOW TAKING IT.

INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - SAME

Again, Tommy is on top of Brendan, trying to ground and pound

him into submission. Frank, leaning on the apron nearby,

screams at Brendan.

Tommy tries to pound Brendan out, but Brendan latches on to

Tommy's arm, wraps his legs around him, and REVERSES

position, just as he did with Midnight, the Dane, and Koba.

Tommy is in deep trouble. Brendan pushes him face down on the

canvas and cranks his shoulder. There's no escape.

Brendan applies intense pressure. Tommy's shoulder is

contorted, WRENCHED backwards, and his face is a mask of

pain. Tommy's in agony, but he won't give in.

Tommy SHRIEKS like an animal, but still won't quit. In fact,

he elbows Brendan in the face in defiance. Brendan in turn

cranks the shoulder even more. It's at the breaking point.

The shoulder twists. Twists. And then, audible only to Tommy

and Brendan, CRACK. Dislocated. Then the HORN ending the

round.

Brendan, worried he hurt his brother, leans over to see if

Tommy's alright, but Tommy, like a wounded animal, leaps up

and grabs Brendan around the throat with his one good arm. He

shoves him all the way across the cage and into the fence,

and it takes Rosenthal and Frank to separate them.

EXT. STARLIGHT DRIVE-IN - SAME

The crowd fired up by Brendan's comeback, and mesmerized by

what's taking place in the cage between the brothers. It's

complete and utter chaos in there.

ON MOVIE SCREEN: TOMMY PACES IN HIS CORNER, HIS SHOULDER

WRECKED. JOSH ROSENTHAL TRIES TO SEE IF HE'S ALRIGHT BUT

TOMMY TURNS AWAY. HE'S NOT QUITTING AND NO ONE'S GOING TO

TELL HIM HE HAS TO.

INT. COLT'S PITTSBURGH FIGHT CLUB - SAME

Sheer amazement that Tommy didn't submit.

INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - SAME

Tommy, flap down, tears of pain pouring down his face, stands

defiantly in his corner. In the other corner, Frank attends

Brendan. In the crowd, Tess covers her mouth. She can't

believe what Tommy allowed to happen to him.

Frank puts the stool down and gives Brendan some water.

Brendan's face is wracked with guilt and concern over his

brother.

This is not what Brendan wants to hear. He looks over to Josh

Rosenthal.

Frank snaps. Grabs Brendan by the face.

Rosenthal claps his hands. Frank exits the cage. The wounded

Tommy stands in his corner, his ruined left arm hanging low.

Brendan makes eye contact with him.

The BELL sounds. Round Four begins. Tommy throws useless

right jabs. He's one handed and has no chance. Brendan stays

away from him, not wanting to hurt his brother.

Frank screams at Brendan from cageside to take the wounded

Tommy out, but Brendan is reluctant.

Tommy and Brendan circle each other. Tommy throwing rights

and wincing in agony at any movement. Brendan stares at him.

Everything about him says "Quit, Tommy." But Tommy won't.

INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA TUNNEL - SAME

Paddy runs up the tunnel, his All Access pass around his

neck, and enters the arena. Sees Brendan and Tommy in the

cage. Quickly figures out what the situation is.

EXT. STARLIGHT DRIVE-IN - SAME

Zito and the kids staring at the screen, imploring Brendan to

take the helpless Tommy out and win the championship.

INT. BOARDWALK HALL CAGE - SAME

Brendan continues to circle and not engage. Frank is livid.

He knows he'll lose the fight on the judges' scorecards if he

doesn't do something.

Tommy keeps throwing defiant right jabs at Brendan. Finally,

with no choice, Brendan fires back. He batters the

defenseless Tommy up against the cage and POUNDS away at him,

blasting his left shoulder with punches that make Tommy wince

in pain. It's anyone's guess how he can take it.

Brendan presses his brother up against the cage. Begging him

to quit. But Tommy merely responds by elbowing Brendan in the

face again. This sets the older brother off, and he resumes

pounding on Tommy until the HORN sounds and Rosenthal pulls

Brendan away.

Brendan heads back to his stool as Tommy leans against the

cage in agony. The Marines scream for him, but his eyes are

glazed over. It's unthinkable that he hasn't broken yet.

From near cageside, Paddy looks to the corner and makes eye

contact with Brendan. They exchange a small look of

understanding. A NOD. They both know what needs to be done.

EXT. STARLIGHT DRIVE-IN - SAME

The crowd wants a victory. Tito and the boys start the "Mis-

ter C!" chant again.

ON MOVIE SCREEN: FRANK ADMONISHES BRENDAN IN HIS CORNER. IT'S

OBVIOUS WHAT HE'S TELLING HIM, BUT BRENDAN'S EYES ARE FAR

AWAY. HE'S NOT LISTENING TO A WORD.

INT. BOARDWALK HALL CAGE - MOMENTS LATER

Tommy and Brendan stand for Round Five. Tommy's face is

battered after Round Four and Brendan's face is ruined.

In the crowd, the "Tommy" CHANT begins in earnest. In fact,

it may be louder than ever. Having done the impossible and

carried on with one arm, Tommy is more superhuman and heroic

than ever before. But his face tells another story. Soaked in

pain and anguish. All his stoic walls crumbling down.

INT. COLT'S PITTSBURGH FIGHT CLUB - MOMENTS LATER

All eyes riveted to the screen, where the brothers circle

each other as in the fourth round.

ON SCREEN: MORE PAINFUL STABBING JABS FROM TOMMY. BRENDAN

GIVES HIM ONE LAST, LONG LOOK, BUT TOMMY RESPONDS BY KICKING

HIM IN THE LEG. FINALLY, LEFT NO CHOICE, BRENDAN SWOOPS.

INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - SAME

Brendan SLAMS Tommy to the ground. His face is contorted in

merciless pain. Brendan slips his forearm under Tommy's neck

and squeezes. Tommy struggles, but he's got one arm and

there's NO ESCAPE. His face getting red from lack of oxygen.

As an anguished Tess and a shaken Paddy look on, Brendan

CHOKES his brother. As he does, he pleads with him.

Tommy continues to struggle.

Tears pour down Tommy's face. Brendan is crushing his wind

pipe. Tommy's eyes bulge.

Tommy, about to pass out, no more air to breathe, slowly

opens his left hand, looks at Brendan, and TAPS his shoulder

on the Conlon family crest. Finally submitting.

EXT. STARLIGHT DRIVE-IN - SAME

While most of the crowd erupts in celebration and the kids

leap into each other's arms, Joe Zito stares at the screen.

ON MOVIE SCREEN: AS PEOPLE ENTER THE RING, BRENDAN AND TOMMY

STAY ON THE GROUND, BRENDAN CRADLING HIS BROTHER IN HIS ARMS.

INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - SAME

Frank makes eye contact with the jubilant Tess. Indicates she

should meet them in the locker room. Meanwhile, people pour

into the cage. Frank pushes them aside, keeping them away

from Brendan and Tommy, who remain on the ground, exhausted.

Tommy to begins to WEEP.

INT. COLT'S PITTSBURGH FIGHT CLUB - SAME

Silence at Colt's. Everyone spent from what they've seen.

ON TV SCREEN: CHAOS IN THE RING. BRENDAN HOLDS TOMMY IN HIS

ARMS AND PUSHES AWAY A DOCTOR.

INT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA CAGE - SAME

Tommy buries his head in Brendan's chest. A torrent of

sobbing gushes from him, years of pain pouring out in heavy

bursts. From the crowd, Paddy stares into the cage and

watches as Brendan comforts his little brother, then helps

him to his feet.

Callen, Sheridan, and J.J. Riley make their way inside for

the post-fight interview, cameras trailing behind them. With

Frank continuing to run interference, Brendan pushes through

the crush of people, arm around Tommy, and exits the cage.

The crowd parts for Tommy and Brendan. Paddy watches them, a

tear in his eye. He's overwhelmed by the sight of his two

boys together again.

As the noise from the arena fades, the brothers walk through

the wild crowd and continue on through the tunnel, arm in

arm...
