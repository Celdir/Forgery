1   EXT. THE STAMPEDE TRAIL - DAY                                    1

The driver reaches behind the seat of the truck, pulls

out an old pair of rubber work boots.

There is a pause as Backpack considers accepting the

boots.

We can feel over Backpack's shoulder that he has taken

the boots and is putting them on but we STAY on the

driver.

Backpack hands him an Instamatic camera and starts

walking backwards. We PULL BACK with him. And he

maintains his back to us. When he stops, we CONTINUE

until he is FULL-FRAME, head-to-toe from behind, posing.

CU: driver

CLICK.   He snaps the shot.

Backpack re-enters frame in an OVER-SHOULDER.          Driver

hands him the camera.

As Backpack exits the frame, we SLOWLY ZOOM past the

concerned face of the driver onto the loose change, the

comb, and the watch on the dash.

2   EXT. COMMENCEMENT GROUNDS, EMORY UNIVERSITY, ATLANTA -         2

Disregarding the steps that lead up to the podium

platform, the small-framed but athletic CHRIS MCCANDLESS

leaps jubilantly onto the stage in a single bound,

frightening Billie, a little wince from Walt, and Carine

"That's our Chris." And just as quickly as Chris has

been handed his diploma, he civilly descends the platform

steps.

SLO-MO: A ballet of graduation caps float upward into a

frame of blue sky. We HEAR Chris' voice OVER this image

as we intermittently cut away from the caps against the

sky to focus on his parents.

(HIGH ANGLE: floating caps in FOREGROUND, Walt and Billie

delight upon the caps.) An outer glee in sharp contrast

to voice over:

Chris McCandless speaking to camera holds a microphone in

a shadowy room, doing his Geraldo Rivera. It's tongue-in-

cheek at best.

He indicates a hatchway in the floor leading to a

brightly lit corridor below.

We HEAR a GROWLING SOUND from behind Chris.

CAMERA quickly PANS to a blanket-wrapped, crawling FELLOW

STUDENT in a grotesque Halloween mask.

We MOVE INTO CU on the monster growling.

QUICK PAN back to Chris.

CAMERA SHAKES all over like a bad horror film trying to

stay with Chris as he makes a quick escape down the

hatchway into the University dorm corridor.

CLUMSY VIDEO TIME CUT: Chris nailing the last nail in

the hatchway from below. He climbs down the steps where

he exchanges his hammer for his microphone from an off-

camera source.

We HEAR the monster's GROWL from above.

15   INT. WOULD-BE TED TURNER OFFICE                             15

Behind Chris in the corridor outside Ted's office, a

PANICKED STUDENT arrives at the door.

Microphone in hand, Chris makes haste. The CAMERA RUNS

WITH HIM out the door, through the corridor, up a set of

steps to the hatchway. As he arrives, the monster

appears above him in the hatchway crawl space having

pulled off the board Chris had nailed.

A piano is PUSHED INTO FRAME beside Chris. A YOUNG BLACK

STUDENT pulls a stool in front of the piano and begins to

play. Chris begins to serenade the monster,

intermittently sharing the serenade directly into camera

as well. He bursts into an uninhibited solo of Tender Is

The Night.

CAMERA TILTS UP to the monster looking out the hatchway,

slowly dying from the song being sung.

As the song continues to be sung and the monster

continues to die, the AUDIO RECEDES and VIDEO IMAGES GO

TO SLO MO.

The Forest Ranger bends over. Pops his flashlight

through the tent door and peers around a bit before re-

addressing Chris.

They shake hands and the Forest Ranger disappears into

the thicket.

REVERSE: Chris, moving to the mysterious object. As he

lifts it, we see that it is a goofy looking straw hat.

He dusts it off, and snugs it onto his head, when a

police car comes into frame and stops beside Chris.

With a quick blast of the siren, Chris turns to regard

the police car. The POLICEMAN gets out of the car and

moves to Chris.

Chris does not oblige.

Rainey makes a move to put his arm around Jan. She goes

a little stiff and fends it off. Chris notices.

But Rainey's humor does not hide an inner turmoil.

Chris pulls out his pocketknife, cuts the twine that

binds the firewood to his body, and takes a seat beside

Rainey.

Chris is looking off at Jan walking in the distance.

Rainey gives him a sideways glance.

She and my dad had decided to bend the

truth about this other child saying that

dad wasn't the father and they maintained

that their fraudulent marriage was real.

Chris was quiet when he told me this. He

said it made his "entire childhood seem

like a fiction"; that "the truth had been

dying everyday." If something bothered

Chris, he'd usually keep it to himself.

And he made me promise to do the same.

Chris is dazzled by this renaissance man of the plains.

Wayne stands to dish out a couple of plates of heated

food. As Chris starts digging in, a major gust of wind

rocks the trailer.

Chris doesn't respond, digs into the food. Points to the

unconscious tribe splayed out. SIX GERMANIC-LOOKING

UNCONSCIOUS BODIES.

Wayne gets a little giggle.

INTERCUT the crew at work with a SERIES OF MYSTERY

ANGLES: Tires kicking up dust on dirt roads, through

town, and into the field behind the grain elevator. Back

to the work, back to the tires. Back to the work, back

to these several cars hauling ass through the field.

Back to Wayne, up high in the grain elevator -

Chris' POV: from high in the grain elevator. He watches

Wayne below, as Wayne saunters out to the field to take a

piss. With his back to us, Wayne whips it out and starts

pissing about 25 yards from the grain elevator.

CU Wayne. He looks up from his urination, the grain

elevator behind him. We see a slight mischievous smile

come to his face. He puts his hands up into the air when

suddenly -

Six unmarked FBI vehicles surround him.

(Director's note: Triangulate three long lenses on Wayne

as the mysterious cars enter each frame, as they skid to

a dusty stop on all sides of him.)

Chris and the men of his crew look on.

As Wayne is handcuffed and led away, he nods up to his

boys.

With that, the FBI agents have hustled the good-natured

Wayne into the back of one of the cars.

Chris - can't turn that down!   He paddles to within feet

of the water's edge.

Chris gives Sonja a little wave. She bypasses it, wading

up to the Kayak, giving him a big hug.

This couple is extremely energetic. Can't wait to

please. And a bona fide American adventurer in their

midst. It's everything they could've wanted.

Mads grabs a hotdog from the Hibachi.

Sonja has moved to the tent to put on a dry T-shirt. But

as she moves back to the water's edge, those nipples keep

saying Hello.

Chris, meanwhile, simply cannot wipe the smile off his

face in the presence of these warm, open people.

Mads plops two more hotdogs onto the grill.

And then, we come here.   Maybe you go to

Mexico.

Chris likes the idea.

Sonja grabs a map from the tent, opens and scrutinizes

it. We follow her finger tracing the river.

Sonja walks the map over to Chris at water's edge and

hands it to him. He studies it.

Chris traces his finger along the impossibly long route

leading to El Golfo de Santa Clara.

Mads with a burst of re-exhilaration, grabs Chris' hand,

shaking it violently.

Sonja heads back for her hotdog taking her T-shirt off on

the move. Chris is about to bust a gut. Sonja returns

to her sunbathing. These two are a hoot.

Just then, something catches Chris' attention upriver.

We can just barely make out the SOUNDS of a jet boat

motor. His eyes narrow a bit, then -

Chris looks up from his book to the wide open 16-year old

smile of Tracy. Rainey laughs aloud. Chris smiles back,      *

and against his better instincts, gives her a little wave-

over with the paperback. Tracy jumps off her step,           *

putting her guitar inside the rig, and trots like a

little wood nymph to Chris.

They share a laugh. Chris comes to the end of his sit-

ups. Wipes his brow with a towel. Rainey squats down

next to him.

The connection is not lost on Chris.

Chris doesn't answer. A kid rides by on a bright new Big

Wheel. Must be from the rich side of the commune.

Hmmm. You strike me as a bright young

man. Am I wrong about that?

I think I got my head on my shoulders

pretty good.

That's what I mean.    How long have you

been out here?

Couple of weeks.

And before that?

A lot of places. I've been moving

around.

How old are you?

Twenty-three.

Twenty-three years old! Son, don't you

think you should be getting an education?

And a job? And making something of this

life?

Look Mr. Franz. I think careers are a

twentieth century invention and I don't

want one. You don't need to worry about

me. I have a college education. I'm not

destitute. I'm living like this by

choice.

In the dirt?

Yeah, in the dirt.

I just don't know.    Where's your family?

Chris can see some deep sadness in this man.

Ron follows Chris to the rockface we'd seen Chris running

earlier. They begin to walk up it. It's tough on the

old-timer, walking this steep hill. But he's a tough old-

timer, at least for the moment...

ANGLE: The two men nearly half way to the summit.     It's

getting steeper and higher. Ron stops.

Their POV: Enormous beautiful vista all the way across

the Bajada.

Ron looks up the precarious rock wall.   He ain't gonna be

seeing the Salton Sea today.

Above the kitchen sink, Chris sees a row of approximately

ten photographs, each in vertical 4x6 frames, some black

and white, some color: all of Japanese boys and girls in

formal American and Japanese attire.

Ron pops the steaks on the kitchen table.

Ron grabs some silverware from a drawer, plops it down on

the kitchen table with some paper napkins.

As Ron gets the drinks -

Ron pops the drinks down on the table, then sits with

Chris. They lift their glasses toward one another, then -

Ron, spinning his body around, points to the photographs

over the sink.

For the last picture frame, Ron stands and takes it off

the shelf -

Chris takes the picture and studies Akira's face.   Ron

sits back down.

Chris is laughing and clapping.

Chris is jumping up and down, thrilled for Ron's efforts.

Now the old man's shuffle has turned into an old man's

walk. But he ain't stopping. And bit by bit he shows

he's got it in him after all.

As Ron is just about to mount the summit, Chris extends a

hand. Ron swats it away.

Ron drops down onto his back to catch his breath and let

his thumping heart slow down.

Ron, after taking one more deep breath, sits up and Chris

sits next to him. He's actually pretty happy with

himself. He looks out and sees the distant Salton Sea.

206   INT. LAUNDRY ROOM, RON'S HOUSE - NIGHT (MARCH 11, 1992) 206

Ron appears in the doorway dressed for travel.

Chris says nothing.

From just out of Chris' eye-line, Ron leans out of frame,

picking up a zippered duffel bag. He opens it,

displaying the contents to Chris.

Chris does, nodding his thanks.

He does, but with a low, gurgled animal sound. He shakes

it off and looks to his copy of Doctor Zhivago for

distraction. Thumbing through the pages he focuses his

eyes on the page -

ANGLE: The page: what he reads:

Chris steals his pencil from within the pages of the

book, scribbling across the page:

He flips backwards a couple of pages to where he had

written the quote:

He tears the back cover off the book and scratching the

pencil across its blank side, writing these words

quickly, as if in panic:

I HAVE HAD A HAPPY LIFE AND THANK THE LORD.    GOODBYE AND

MAY GOD BLESS ALL!

And now, these words arrive slowly as we HEAR Chris

repeating:

The drumbeat increases as he signs the note:

CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON MCCANDLESS.

We move from the page back up to Chris. We see that he

has put on his eyeglasses to strengthen the vision of his

weakening sight. He removes them, folds them, and lays

them by his side. His body begins to tremble. His eyes

dance wildly.

The drumming intensifies.

Chris takes one last look out the window. The sun is

covered by a well-defined and puffy cloud.

Chris: The LAST, AIRY EXPULSION OF HIS BREATH.

His open face as the clearing light of the sun shines in

his eyes. It is a face of peace, love, a face of true,

deep serenity.

The eyes joyously open and the corners of his mouth ease

into the subtle smile of euphoric wisdom.

That's the way he settles to stillness, looking directly

into our camera.

He made it.   He lived.   He loved.

Cat Stevens' Miles from Nowhere plays OVER:

As we PULL AWAY from Chris' face through the bus window

and up into the sky -

We drift further and further away, above the stunted

trees and the shimmering roof of the bus like a tiny

white gleam in a wild green sea grows smaller and

smaller.

REPRISE IMAGE of truck driver taking picture of Chris in

scene #1.

Then it's him:

The smiling STILL IMAGE we saw taken in the first scene

from behind, but now we are seeing it from the front and

it is the image of the real Christopher McCandless on the

edge of the Stampede Trail. As it takes over the screen,

we ZOOM SLOWLY into his smiling face. And then, these

words appear superimposed over it:

Dedicated to the memory of Christopher Johnson McCandless

February 12, 1968 - August 18th, 1992

As those words dissolve, these words appear:

On September 19, 1992, Carine McCandless flew with her

brother's ashes from Alaska home to the eastern seaboard.

She carried them with her on the plane...in her backpack.
