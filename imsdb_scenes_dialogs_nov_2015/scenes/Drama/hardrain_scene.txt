FADE IN

RAIN

Falls from low grey clouds. Down below we see...

THE RIVER

Muddy, slow and powerful, overflowing its banks. In the near

distance is...

THE RESERVOIR

Filled to the maximum, water thundering out of two open gates.

We close in on...

THE DAM

There's a Dam Control Office in the middle of the dam. We

MOVE OFF the reservoir and head out over...

THE TOWN OF HUNTINGBURG

We see "NO FEAR" spelled out in stones on one man's roof. We

go down and into...

EXT. STREETS OF HUNTINGBURG - DUSK

Storefronts are sandbagged and closed. A sign on one store

reads: GONE FISHING. A sign on another: HEY LOOTER. NOTHING

OF VALUE HERE. TRY NEXT DOOR. And on the next store: HE'S

LYING.

A CHURCH

Beautiful, old, ringed with a five-foot-high wall of sandbags.

The floodwater is up to the first level of sandbags.

CARS AND PICKUP TRUCKS

Loaded down, are heading out of town on streets covered in

the first water of the flood.

A STATUE

On an island in the middle of the street. It's Civil War-

era, of a general on a horse, sword held high. The floodwater

is over the curb, lapping at the base of statue's pedestal.

Near the statue stands...

THE SHERIFF

50s, with soft edges and friendly eyes. He's talking into

his radio mike.

EXT. RESERVOIR DAM

HANK, the dam control officer, is on the radio with the

Sheriff.

EXT. MAIN STREET

WAYNE and PHIL, two deputies, 30s, are near the Sheriff,

shoring up a sandbag wall that has partially collapsed.

Wayne shrugs a "whatever" and pulls a sandbag up out of the

water. There's unpleasant-looking muck all over his arms. He

drops the sandbag back into the water and shakes off the

crud with disgust.

The Sheriff walks over.

They turn at the sound of honking. The MAYOR drives up.

Wayne nods. Phil stiffens. They do not like this guy.

Phil grumbles to himself.

The Mayor rolls up his window and heads off.

INT. BANK VAULT

Nervous assistant bank manager WELLMAN is hurriedly tossing

stacks of money into two canvas bags.

A MAN'S SHADOW

Washes up on Wellman.

SECOND SHADOW COMES UP

Wellman is about to speak, then sees something, gulps.

A SHOTGUN

Is held by one of the men, pointed at the floor.

WELLMAN

Sweeps the money off the shelves and into the bags.

THE TWO MEN

Ignore Wellman, grab the canvas bags and stride off.

EXT. BANK - DAY

CLOSE ON the lower half of the front doors as they fly open.

Out come TWO MEN in long dark raincoats.

WELLMAN

Runs up, stopping in the open door.

VERY CLOSE ON THE TWO MEN

As they slowly turn to face Wellman. We just see their faces,

shielded from the rain by hat brims. Meet...

TOM AND CHARLIE

Tom, 30, handsome, with an easy smile. Charlie, 50, with a

tough, red face.

WELLMAN

Looks nervous for a second, then holds up a clipboard.

TOM AND CHARLIE

We see, for the first time, by their hats and uniforms, that

they are armored car drivers. There's an armored car parked

at the curb, on the other side of a low wall of sandbags.

Charlie sighs, goes back to Wellman and perfunctorily signs

the form. Then he and Tom go to the sandbag wall. Tom holds

both bags in one hand and the shotgun in the other. Charlie

doesn't want to get wet.

He steps from the sandbag wall onto the rear bumper of the

truck, then keys open the doors.

Charlie reaches out for the money bags. Tom jumps off the

sandbag wall and lands in the water, splashing Charlie.

Charlie takes the bags, tosses them in then shuts the back.

He moves toward the front, still trying to keep out of the

water. Tom splashes him some more.

Tom kicks some more water at Charlie. Charlie gives Tom a

withering look and climbs in the truck.

INT. ARMORED TRUCK

Charlie gets into the driver's seat; Tom climbs into the

shotgun seat. They shut and bolt the doors. Charlie gets on

the radio.

Charlie hangs up the radio. He starts writing on a clipboard.

Silence for a few moments, and then Charlie notices Tom

staring at him.

Charlie grabs a donut bag off the seat and tosses it to Tom.

Charlie starts the truck. Tom thinks about it, then tosses

the bag back.

Charlie slams the clipboard down on the seat.

Tom doesn't reply. Charlie puts the truck in gear; starts

off. Tom looks at Charlie, shakes his head -- what was that

about?

EXT. ROADSIDE BAR - ESTABLISHING - DUSK

INT. ROADSIDE BAR - DUSK ECU PEN ON PAPER

Writing letters in a crossword puzzle. Holding the pen is...

JIM

Late 50s, with a creased face and piercing eyes. He's sitting

at the bar, drinking coffee. Rain sheets down outside. The

BARTENDER watches TV, sound off. Next to Jim at the bar are...

RAY, KENNY AND MR. MEHLOR

Ray, 40s, has lank hair, rheumy eyes and a glass of Irish

whisky in front of him. Kenny, 20s, long hair, has the energy

of a puppy -- unfortunately he has about as much smarts as a

puppy. Mr. Mehlor. 40s, looks like -- and was -- a high school

teacher.

ON TV

Sound off, a MAN is crying about what he has lost in the

flood.

Ray takes a drink. Kenny leans over to Ray, sotto.

A thought comes to Jim -- an answer to a clue in the crossword --

and he starts filling in words as Ray and Kenny talk.

Jim leans over to Kenny.

Jim slides the newspaper in front of Kenny.

Jim points at the newspaper.

Kenny shrugs and looks down at the newspaper.

His eyes go wide.

ECU CROSSWORD PUZZLE

In an uncompleted part of the puzzle, Jim has written a

message in the boxes. It reads: MENTION MONEY AND I'LL KILL

YOU.

JIM AND KENNY

Kenny looks up at Jim. Jim glances over at the bartender

then back at Kenny. Understand?

INT. ARMORED TRUCK - DUSK

Charlie and Tom continue to drive in silence. They both sneak

looks at each other. Their eyes meet for a second, then they

look away. A moment's pause then...

A hint of a smile on both of them. Tom reaches for Charlie.

Charlie goes red in the face, pushes Tom away.

EXT. ROAD OUT OF TOWN - DUSK

Looking away from town, the HIGH SCHOOL is on the left. On

the right is the CEMETERY. Farther on, on the left, is a CAR

AND BOAT DEALERSHIP. The road is covered in water.

THE ARMORED TRUCK

Goes by the entrance to the high school, water shooting up

from the wheels, pushing out in a wide wake.

INT. TRUCK

Tom glances ahead and sees that the road is covered in water.

THEIR POV

Stretching out ahead of them are reflector bars on the

telephone poles, a few feet above the rippling surface of

the floodwater.

Tom sees something ahead. He doesn't understand at first.

HIS POV

The reflector bar on the pole two poles ahead is lower than

the others. No reflector bars for a hundred yards, then they

resume.

Tom figures out what's going on with the reflector bars.

OUTSIDE THE TRUCK

The water rises fast up the grille as the truck angles down.

INSIDE THE TRUCK

Charlie stands on the brakes.

THEIR POV

A wave of water rushes forward from the truck, then comes

back and washes over the hood, splashing up on the windshield.

Charlie throws the truck into reverse but gives it too much

power. They hear the rear wheels spinning underwater. Charlie

eases off, the tires start to catch, they start moving

backwards.

Charlie and Tom exchange a quick look of relief... and then

the engine dies. Charlie tries to restart it, but there's

nothing.

OUTSIDE THE TRUCK

It's stopped on a downgrade -- it's a dip in the road.

The water is up to the top of the front tires: up to the

hubcaps on the rear wheels. The headlights are underwater,

spots of yellow glowing. They've stopped next to a lighted

sign.

CLOSE ON SIGN

IN THE TRUCK

Tom opens the door. Charlie adjusts the radio frequency

selection button; clicks on.

Tom climbs out and up on top of the truck.

OUTSIDE THE TRUCK

Tom stands on top of the truck. In one direction, nothing

but blackness. The other way he can see the lights of the

town. But there are no cars coming.

IN THE TRUCK

Charlie looks over as Tom appears, upside-down, in the

doorway.

There's a sudden sparking sound and the radio cuts out and

interior lights and the headlights go out.

INT. HOUSE - DUSK POV THROUGH WINDOW

Looking out as the Sheriff's car rolls past on the water-

covered street. A HAND lets go of a curtain and it swings

across the window.

EXT. STREET - DUSK IN THE SHERIFF'S CAR

The Sheriff motions Wayne to stop the car, then he grabs the

radio mike and clicks it on as a megaphone.

No one comes out of the house.

A few moments pass and then...

HENRY AND DOREEN SWERZKY

Late 70s, step out onto their porch.

THE SHERIFF

Gets out of the car.

The Sheriff wants to say something more, but he's not about

to argue with Doreen. He just nods and gets back into the

car.

IN THE CAR

The Sheriff climbs back in. He and Wayne watch Henry and

Doreen go back into the house, Doreen still nagging at Henry.

The Sheriff sighs, nods to Wayne. Wayne puts the car in gear.

EXT. ARMORED TRUCK - NIGHT

The water is creeping up the sloping hood of the truck.

Tom shrugs -- Charlie's right. They're about to get out when

light washes up on them. They look out to see...

THE HEADLIGHTS OF A GMC SUBURBAN

Approaching on the other side of the dip, a quarter-mile

away.

CHARLIE AND TOM

Look at each other then get out of the truck.

THE SUBURBAN

Stops on the far side of the dip -- a hundred yards away.

The headlights shine across the water. Doors open and MEN

get out.

TOM AND CHARLIE

Come around the front of the truck. They can't see through

the glare of the Suburban's bright headlights.

Charlie looks at Tom, relieved.

THE SUBURBAN

Headlights go on high beam.

CHARLIE AND TOM

Squint, blinded by the high beams.

Charlie looks at him -- what does he mean? Tom puts his hand

on his pistol.

IN THE WATER

Assembled by the Suburban are...

JIM AND HIS MEN

All holding guns. He speaks to them quietly.

They start wading down into the dip in the road. Kenny carries

a rifle.

TOM AND CHARLIE

Tom squints through the bright light.

Tom starts to pull his gun.

KENNY

is fired up on adrenalin. He has his rifle up and is aiming

it.

HIS POV

Tom with his hand on his pistol, starting to pull it out.

TOM AND CHARLIE

Charlie sees Tom going for his gun. He moves close to Tom,

half in front of him, putting his hand on Tom's.

KENNY

Stiffens.

KENNY'S FINGER

Squeezes the trigger of his rifle.

TOM

Jumps at the sound of the rifle crack.

CHARLIE

Is knocked back.

TOM

Yanks out his gun and starts shooting back.

JIM AND HIS MEN

Duck down in the water.

TOM

Shooting blindly, looks over and sees...

CHARLIE

A horrible look on his face, blood coming out of his neck.

He sinks into the water.

KENNY

Shoots off another few quick rounds.

TOM

Drops into the water, bullets plugging in around him. Just

his hand and pistol are visible, shooting blindly back toward

Jim and his men. THE SUBURBAN

Is hit by Tom's fire.

TOM

Runs out of bullets. A beat later we see Charlie start moving

through the water -- Tom is pulling him.

KENNY

Doesn't hear Jim and keeps firing.

JIM

Aims his pistol at Kenny's head.

Kenny stops.

BEHIND THE ARMORED TRUCK

Tom comes up in the water behind the truck, gasping, holding

Charlie. Tom rests his gun on the truck bumper.

Charlie's gone.

JIM AND HIS MEN

Jim glares at Kenny, his eyes on fire.

TOM

Shuts his eyes, thinking, scared.

Tom opens his eyes. He looks down at...

CHARLIE

Floating in the water.

TOM

What the hell is he going to do?

JIM AND HIS MEN

Jim's men look at him. Jim motions them to wait some more.

Jim and the others wait, but there's no answer from Tom.

Still no response from Tom.

THEIR POV

All they can see is the front of the truck, in the light of

the "Welcome" sign. They can't see the back.

JIM AND HIS MEN

Jim nods to his men. They head for the truck, down into the

deeper water at the bottom of the dip in the road. All have

guns up and ready.

Jim sends Mr. Mehlor and Ray out to circle around. They all

move quietly. The only sound is the rain.

JIM

Gets to the truck and moves along its side, Kenny right behind

him. Jim gets to the back of the truck, nods for Kenny to

cover him, then steps out behind the truck, gun up.

JIM'S POV

Tom is gone.

CHARLIE

Is floating in the water, eyes of glass.

KENNY, MR. MEHLOR AND RAY

Step into the circle of light thrown by the "Welcome" sign.

Mr. Mehlor nods and digs into his pack. Ray looks down at

Charlie in the water.

Ray laughs.

Mr. Mehlor laughs as he pulls something out of his pack.

It's...

SMALL EXPLOSIVE DEVICE

A half-stick of dynamite with a timer, mounted on a magnet.

Mr. Mehlor puts the device on the back door.

Something's wrong. Jim touches the handle on the door. It

moves. Uh-oh. He raises his pistol, grabs the door handle

and pulls. The door swings open. We don't need to see what

he sees -- we can tell from the expression on his face.

EXT. ON THE ROAD

Tom is running hard through the knee-deep water, pulling a

string of canvas money bags buckled together. The truck and

"Welcome" sign are two hundred yards behind him. Tom hears

an angry yell.

EXT. BY THE ARMORED TRUCK

Kenny is the one yelling.

They quiet. The patter of the rain is too loud -- they can't

hear anything. Jim scans the horizon, but sees nothing.

Jim is looking at something in the distance.

INT. CAR AND BOAT DEALERSHIP - SHOWROOM

A glass window is smashed and water floods into the boat

showroom. Jim and his men stride in. Kenny ogles a

particularly nice cruiser. Jim stops at a smallish ski-boat.

Mr. Mehlor heads off.

KENNY

Sees something else he likes. We don't see what it is.

EXT. CEMETERY

The name WILLIAM PORTMAN is chiseled into a crypt. Tom appears

from underwater, gasping for breath. He gets to his feet and

trudges off through the water.

EXT. ROAD OUTSIDE CEMETERY

Tom comes out through the gates of the cemetery, splashing

through the knee-deep water. He's running when he hears,

from behind him, boat engines firing up. He turns to see...

LIGHTS

Racing toward him over the water, a hundred and fifty yards

back.

TOM

Sprints off.

THE SKI-BOAT

Jim is steering the ski-boat. Mr. Mellor hunkers down beside

him. We PULL BACK to see...

TWO JET-SKIS

Flanking the ski-boat, piloted by Kenny and Ray.

ON THE ROAD

Tom is running as fast as he can. He looks back, sees the

ski-boat and jet-skis closing. They'll get him before he

gets to town. He suddenly veers off the road toward...

THE HIGH SCHOOL

The sign out front reads: GO WARRIORS!

EXT. HIGH SCHOOL

Tom runs around the side of the high school.

JIM AND HIS MEN

Ride up on the ski-boat and jet-skis and round the corner.

THEIR POV

No sign of Tom.

The engines are shut down. They all drift. Jim shines a

flashlight over onto...

WINDOWS

There's a hole in a window large enough to climb through.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL - CLASSROOM

Tom wades through the classroom, pushing floating desks aside.

Flashlight beams stab into the room. Tom hurries to the hall.

EXT. HIGH SCHOOL

Jim turns to his men.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY

Tom makes his way past banks of lockers, trying to get as

far as he can from the probing flashlight beams.

EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - FRONT DOORS

Kenny drifts up to the front doors. He pulls on them. Locked.

MR. MEHLOR

Reaches into his pack.

INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY

Tom tries lockers, looking for a place to hide.

EXT. FRONT DOORS

Kenny rides his jet-ski fast away from the front doors and

the doors explode.

INT. SCHOOL FRONT LOBBY

Tom ducks down as...

A FIREBALL

Shoots over him.

KENNY AND RAY

Ride the jet-skis into the flooded school.

UNDERWATER

Tom is swimming as hard as he can, out of breath. KENNY AND

RAY

Ray goes off down a hall while Kenny idles in the lobby.

TOM

Surfaces, gasping.

KENNY

Hears the gasp, turns, grinning.

TOM

Gets to his feet runs as fast as he can down the hall. He

rounds a corner and keeps going.

KENNY

Guns his engine and takes off after Tom.

TOM

Runs another thirty feet, then trips on something and goes

down.

KENNY

Comes around the corner, grinning when he sees...

TOM

Halfway down the hall, standing frozen, caught in Kenny's

light.

KENNY

Guns it, racing forward down the hall toward Tom.

THE JET-SKI

Hits something underwater and stops.

KENNY

Keeps going. He flies through the air, slams headfirst into

a trophy case and drops into the water.

TOM

Stands up -- he was kneeling.

A HANDRAIL

On the wall, angles down into the water. Underwater there

are a couple of steps leading up to a change in level in the

hall -- that's what the jet-ski grounded on.

HALLWAY

Ray motors down the hallway toward the corner.

HIS POV

Around the corner comes a jet-ski. Ray assumes it's Kenny.

Then the jet-ski speeds up and shoots by him. Ray sees it's...

TOM

Wearing Kenny's hat and jacket.

RAY

Gives chase.

SCHOOL HALLWAYS

Ray races after Tom along the flooded hallways, taking the

turns fast. Ray pulls a gun, starts shooting.

TOM'S POV

Tearing through the halls, flashlight lighting the way.

Bullets hit the walls, ceiling, water around him.

TOM

Comes around a corner, sees the open front doors ahead of

him.

JIM AND MR. MEHLOR

Come into view in the ski-boat, blocking the exit.

TOM

Turns hard and speeds down a side hall.

TOM'S POV

A wall of windows at the end. No way out. Trapped. Then...

KENNY

Rises out of the water, blood running down his face, pistol

up.

TOM

Looks back.

RAY

Is on his tail.

TOM

Makes his choice and guns the jet-ski straight at Kenny.

KENNY

Fires, misses and is knocked to the side as...

TOM

Hunches down on the jet-ski and crashes through the windows.

EXT. HIGH SCHOOL

Jim and Mr. Mehlor are moving right outside the windows just

as Tom blasts out of the school and races off into the dark.

EXT. OPEN WATER

Tom moves fast over the water. He yanks off his clip-on tie.

JIM AND THE OTHERS

Chase Tom's light, behind by fifty yards, heading out into

farm fields. They get closer and closer and then watch as...

TOM'S JET-SKI

Runs straight into a tree and explodes.

JIM AND THE OTHERS

Race up to find the burning, flaming wreckage of the jet-

ski. Ray circles on the other jet-ski. Kenny, still bleeding

from the head, is in the boat with Jim and Mr. Mehlor.

Kenny reacts -- oh, right.

We see what Jim sees.

ECU THROTTLE OF JET-SKI

Tom used his tie to wrap the throttle open.

HUNDRED YARDS AWAY

Tom is hiding in the branches of a floating tree, watching

the distant lights of Jim and his men. The current carries

Tom away.

WITH JIM AND HIS MEN

Jim scans the horizon; sees nothing.

Jim lashes out with a fist, hard and fast, hitting Kenny in

the chest, knocking him out of the ski-boat, into the water.

Kenny comes up in the thigh-deep water, sputtering.

Jim pushes the throttle forward and the ski-boat takes off,

leaving Ray on the jet-ski, with Kenny in the water.

Ray pulls Kenny up onto the jet-ski and takes off after Jim.

EXT. BACK OF CHURCH - SANDBAG WALL

The water level is creeping up a five-foot-high wall of

sandbags.

REVERSE ANGLE

Looking out over the top of the sandbag wall. A tree floats

by on the water.

HANDS

Suddenly appear on the top of the wall and...

TOM

Pulls himself into view. He climbs over the wall, exhausted.

BEHIND THE SANDBAG WALL

Gasoline-powered pumps are sucking up any rainwater. The

sandbags have kept the floodwater at bay.

TOM

He hurries up the back steps and goes into the church.

INT. CHURCH - BACK ROOM

Tom walks through a small room lined with closed cupboards.

He goes through a door.

INT. CHURCH - MAIN HALL

Tom comes out into the altar. He looks around, impressed.

It's a beautiful church. Scaffolding goes up one wall -- the

church is being restored. Tom is startled by a sound from

above. He grabs a heavy silver candlestick as a weapon and

looks up to see...

BIRDS

Fluttering up in the rafters.

TOM

Takes a breath. Just as he relaxes, he hears a whooshing

sound from behind him and turns to see...

A LARGE CRUCIFIX

Being swung at his head. Thunk and...

THE SCREEN GOES BLACK

FADE IN:

INT. SHERIFF'S STATION

Tom slowly regains consciousness, blinking his eyes. He

hears...

But the Sheriff isn't asking Tom, he's asking...

KAREN

30, pretty, even in head-to-toe rain gear.

TOM

Sits up on a cot, behind bars in the holding cell, woozy.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL

Jim and his men are searching the school for the money.

EXT. MAIN STREET

The rain sheets down hard. A lightning flash reveals...

THE STATUE

The water is up to the horse's knees. The lightning passes

and a second later thunder rolls.

INT. SHERIFF'S STATION

The Sheriff, Phil, Wayne and Karen stand outside the cell.

Tom is inside, on the cot. He touches the cut on his forehead.

That stops the room.

They all exchange a look -- that's a lot of money.

They all look at the Sheriff. He looks at Tom.

The Sheriff looks at Tom -- is that it? Tom nods.

The Sheriff thinks for a beat, then tosses some keys to Phil.

Phil nods and goes to it. The Sheriff opens a desk drawer,

pulls out an ankle holster.

The Sheriff starts strapping on the ankle holster.

The Sheriff thwacks Wayne in the ear.

Phil comes over with the guns.

The Sheriff jams a small pistol into his ankle holster.

The Sheriff straightens up, grabs a rifle from Phil and pulls

Karen to the door. Wayne goes to Tom's cell door and pulls

it shut with a click.

The Sheriff rolls his eyes and gestures for Wayne to come

along. He opens the door for Karen, Wayne and Phil to go

through.

EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION

Water is halfway up the four-foot high wall of sandbags around

the station. There are three outboard motorboats moored to

the sandbags.

The Sheriff and Wayne climb toward their boats.

Wayne laughs as he and the Sheriff fire up their boat engines.

INT. SHERIFF'S STATION

Tom hears boat engines start up and move away. He lays back

down on the cot, listening to the rain.

INT. DAM CONTROL OFFICE

Empty. Light comes out from under the door to the bathroom.

INT. BATHROOM

Hank is on the can reading a copy of "American Survivalist"

magazine. An odd reaction comes over his face. He feels

something weird. He looks down.

ON THE FLOOR

Water is seeping in under the door.

INT. DAM CONTROL OFFICE

The bathroom door flies open and Hank waddles out, pants

around his feet. He shuffles fast to the control wheels and

starts spinning them.

EXT. RESERVOIR DAM

Two gates open fast, all the way, and water thunders out.

INT. DAM CONTROL OFFICE

Hank pulls up his pants as he gets on the radio.

EXT. PARK AREA

The Sheriff and Wayne are motoring in their boats, zooming

through the trees, engine noise obliterating anything coming

in over the radio.

INT. DAM CONTROL OFFICE

EXT. MAIN STREET - MOVING BOAT

Phil steers Karen's small boat down Main Street, past the

statue. The water is up to the rider's stirrups.

Karen stands up.

Karen moves to get out of the boat.

Phil lets go of the throttle and stands, moving toward Karen.

Karen suddenly turns on Phil and pushes him out of the boat.

Karen guns the engine and shoots off down a side street.

Phil stands in the waist-deep water and watches her go,

flabbergasted.

EXT. CHURCH

Karen comes around a corner and drives her boat up to the

church. The water is swirling quietly, still a good three

feet below the top of the wall.

EXT. ROAD OUT OF TOWN - WELCOME SIGN

Close on the lighted "Welcome to Huntingburg" sign. There's

a rushing sound and a two-foot-high wall of water hits the

sign. The lights explode in geysers of sparks and the water

rushes on.

EXT. PARK AREA

The Sheriff and Wayne are racing through a grove of half-

submerged trees. There's a rushing sound above the sound of

the engines. WHAM! and they're hit by the wall of water.

Wayne falls out of his boat and is lost in the swirling water.

EXT. ALLEYWAY

Jim and his men are motoring down an alleyway when...

THE WALL OF WATER

Rushes down the alley.

RAY

The water hits him hard, knocking him off the jet-ski. He's

swept away by the water.

CLOSE ON A FENCE LACED WITH CONCERTINA WIRE

The surge water shoots through it. And suddenly there's...

RAY

Slammed up against the fence, pinned to it, water rushing

over and around and by him. He yells as the wire cuts into

him.

EXT. CHURCH

Karen is pouring gasoline into the pumps.

She hears the rushing and looks up as the surge hits. Water

shoots over the top.

INT. SHERIFF'S STATION

Tom hears the sound and opens his eyes -- what the hell is

that?

EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION

The wall of water slams in hard, cascading over the sandbag

wall.

INT. SHERIFF'S STATION

TOM SITS UP, SWINGING HIS LEGS OVER THE SIDE OF THE COT. HE

REACTS, LOOKS DOWN. HIS POV

There's two feet of water in the station.

EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION

The building is like a rock in a stream, with the water

rushing up high against one wall, roiling and swirling around

the sides.

INT. SHERIFF'S STATION

Tom looks over, stunned, to see... THE DOOR

As a fine stream spits in through the keyhole.

THE WINDOWS

Are heaving as the water rises up against them.

TOM

Gets to his feet, woozy and goes to get out of the cell. He

remembers -- uh-oh: the cell door is locked.

EXT. ALLEYWAY

Jim pulls Ray, coughing, choking, bleeding, into the ski-

boat.

INT. SHERIFF'S STATION

The water level inside is rising fast. It hits the wall

sockets and there's a spit of sparks, then all the desk lamps

go dark. Light still comes from overhead fluorescent panels.

Tom sees...

TWO KEYS ON A KEY RING

Laying on the Sheriff's wooden desk. They're four feet away --

too far to reach.

EXT. CHURCH

Karen suddenly has a horrible thought and stops. She shakes

it off -- doesn't want to think about it -- and mutters to

herself.

EXT. MAIN STREET

Phil is clinging to the statue as the water surges by below

him.

EXT. PARK AREA

Wayne gets back into his boat. The Sheriff realizes something.

INT. SHERIFF'S STATION

Tom looks through the cell bars at wooden chairs bobbing in

the water. The Sheriff's desk lifts up, starts floating. Tom

gets an idea. He takes his belt off.

EXT. NEAR SHERIFF'S STATION

A telephone pole is half-submerged, being pulled along fast

by the current.

INT. SHERIFF'S STATION

Tom holds one end of the belt and tosses the rest of it at...

THE DESK

Bobbing in the rising water. He misses the keys.

TOM AND THE DESK

Tom tries again. The belt lands on the desk top.

Tom very gently starts pulling. Too hard; the belt starts

slipping off the desk. He gets it just right and the desk

starts moving toward Tom. He reaches out with his hand,

stretching.

HIS FINGERS

Touch the top of the desk, start pulling it toward him, and

he just gets a firm grip on the desk when...

THE TELEPHONE POLE

Smashes into a window, bending in the bars on the window,

shattering the glass, letting a torrent of water into the

room.

THE DESK

Is moved by the rush of water, but not before Tom grabs...

THE KEYS

And grips them tight.

TOM

Tries the keys in the lock. They don't fit. He looks at them.

CU KEYS

The tag is emblazoned with the Ford logo.

Tom tosses the keys into the water and looks around at...

THE WATER LEVEL

Rising very fast. A foot in ten seconds.

TOM

Climbs up the cell bars, the water rising with him. He's

running out of room between himself and the ceiling. Three

feet. Two feet. He's being pushed up by the water toward...

FLUORESCENT LIGHT FIXTURE

On the ceiling, caged in a wire cover.

TOM

Is terrified, about to die. The water rises up past his face.

TOM'S HANDS

Pull his Maglite flashlight from his belt. He takes off the

lens and the battery cap, then shakes the batteries out.

TOM

Sticks the flashlight tube up through the wire grate over

the light fixture.

He blows out the water -- like clearing a snorkel -- then

breathes. Reprieve for a few moments and then...

THE WATER

Reaches the top of the flashlight tube and starts to trickle

in when...

THE FLUORESCENT LIGHT FIXTURE

Goes dark. In the darkness, there's the sound of tubes

breaking and metal being wrenched.

TOM

Looks up, astonished, to see...

THE FLUORESCENT FIXTURE

Being lifted up and away from above. Streetlight comes in,

silhouetting...

A FIGURE

Standing on the roof. The figure leans down and starts tugging

at the wire cage over the inside of the fixture. In the light,

Tom sees that it's...

KAREN

And she's pulling as hard as she can, but the wire cage isn't

budging. She pulls out a Swiss Army knife, unfolds a small

knife and starts taking out the screws holding the cage in

place. She gets two screws out.

TOM

Pulls on the cage and it swings down. He climbs up it.

EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION ROOF

Tom surfaces in a hole in the roof. There's a vent duct laying

on the roof -- Karen must've kicked that over to get to the

light fixture. Karen helps Tom up. She sits and he lays down

on the roof, catching his breath.

They get up.

Just then...

A PROPANE TANK

Explodes. The fireball rips across the dark sky, illuminating

everything, showing...

JIM AND HIS MEN

Fifty feet away -- Jim, Mr. Mehlor and Ray in the ski-boat

and Kenny on the jet-ski -- guns aimed at Tom and Karen.

DARKNESS

As the lightning passes, and in the darkness, the thunder

rolls.

JIM AND HIS MEN

Switch on their lights and move forward. They pass...

CARS

Floating down the street with other debris. The cars have

been damaged by the flood -- one is missing a door.

JIM AND HIS MEN

When they get closer to the Sheriff's station, what they see --

or don't see -- makes them stop.

THEIR POV

Tom and Karen have disappeared. Karen's boat is still moored

to the Sheriff's station roof, empty.

Kenny shuts off the engine of the one remaining jet-ski. Jim

shuts down the boat engine. They float in silence, scanning

the water with their flashlights. There's no sign of Tom and

Karen.

UNDERWATER

Tom motions Karen to follow him. She's freaked and hesitates.

Tom grabs her hand and pulls her.

THEIR POV

The ski-boat and jet-ski are right above them, flashlights

playing over the water.

JIM AND HIS MEN

Reach the roof of the Sheriff's station. Jim looks around.

LONG SHOT POV THROUGH CAR WINDSHIELD

Of Kenny and Jim heading off in different directions.

TOM AND KAREN

Rise into view in a car. They gasp for air and keep low.

She's about to call out. Tom grabs her hard.

Before Karen can say anything, a flashlight beam comes

swinging toward them and they have to duck underwater.

JIM

Watches as his flashlight beam washes over the car. Nothing

there. He guns his engine and heads off down the street.

THE CAR

Floats off around a corner.

IN THE CAR

Tom and Karen surface, catch their breath. Quiet for a few

moments as they both look around to see that Jim and his men

are gone.

Karen nods. Tom looks at her. She's shivering.

Tom looks at her, gives a little grin. Their eyes meet for a

second, then they look away.

EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION

Phil climbs up onto the roof, exhausted. He sees the hole in

the roof and goes to look at it. As he's looking down...

Phil turns to see...

THE SHERIFF AND WAYNE

Coasting up in their boats.

EXT. ALLEYWAY

Tom and Karen float down the alley in the car.

Silence for a few moments.

Tom nods -- so is he.

EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION

Phil climbs into the Sheriff's boat.

The Sheriff fires up his engine and heads off, Wayne

following.

EXT. ALLEYWAY

Karen and Tom are still in the car. They freeze at the sound

of engines in the distance. The sounds fade. Tom looks around.

Karen plucks some cassette tapes out of the water.

Karen laughs. Just then...

THE CAR

Gets caught on something and stops.

Karen grins. Just then...

A TRANSFORMER

down the street explodes.

TOM AND KAREN

Hear a sparking sound and look over to see...

A TRANSFORMER

On a telephone/power pole close to them. Rain hits it, causing

the sparking sound. The floodwater is inching up the pole

toward it.

The water will reach the transformer in a matter of seconds.

And while they're staring at that...

ANOTHER TRANSFORMER

At the end of the street explodes as water hits it.

TOM AND KAREN

Look around -- what to do? Tom points.

They climb out of the car and start swimming toward a house.

THE TRANSFORMER

Water is three inches from the transformer; two inches...

TOM AND KAREN

Swimming as hard as they can.

THE TRANSFORMER

One inch from the water...

TOM AND KAREN

Reach the house. They pull themselves up onto a television

antenna/ladder running up the side of the house. Karen's

feet are still in the water.

THE TRANSFORMER

The water is about to touch. There's a sizzling sound.

TOM AND KAREN

They heave a huge sigh of relief -- but then Tom realizes...

Tom pushes Karen over onto a window ledge. Then, just as

Tom's about to step over...

KENNY

Comes screaming in on the jet-ski. He dives off the jetski,

gets a hold of Tom and pulls him under.

KENNY AND TOM

Surface. Kenny is stronger and he has Tom in a tight grip.

One problem -- Kenny doesn't know the danger they're in.

Kenny shoves Tom underwater.

Tom comes up, looks over at...

THE TRANSFORMER

The sizzling is getting louder.

Kenny dunks Tom again.

UNDERWATER

Tom grabs Kenny's arms and pulls himself up fast.

KENNY AND TOM

Tom's head comes out of the water and slams into Kenny's

chin. Kenny is stunned. Tom gets free of his grasp.

Tom does the backstroke, pulling hard toward Karen.

KENNY

Still stunned, finally hears the sizzling and looks over

at...

THE TRANSFORMER

The water touches the outer casing of the transformer.

KENNY

Starts swimming fast toward...

TOM AND KAREN

Karen grabs Tom's arm and Tom gets a hold of the windowsill

and pulls himself up.

KENNY

Grabs onto...

THE TV ANTENNA

And starts pulling himself out of the water.

THE TRANSFORMER

Explodes.

KENNY

Feels pretty pleased with himself until...

THE TV ANTENNA

Starts dancing with electricity and...

KENNY

Is hit by the voltage and his teeth clamp shut and his body

goes rigid and his clothes explode in flames.

TOM AND KAREN

Look away.

THE WATER

Dead fish start floating to the surface.

KENNY

Is fried, smoking. He falls off the TV antenna and hits the

water with a loud and ugly hiss. He floats away, his body

shaking spasmodically.

TOM AND KAREN

Tom hears an engine approaching. He looks around, then smashes

the window with his elbow.

INT. HOUSE

The window glass tumbles in. Tom reaches in, undoes the latch

and slides up the window. He climbs in, straddling the window

sill. The camera moves down Tom's leg to show...

A WOLF TRAP

Laying on the floor, just below the window.

TOM

Is oblivious. He starts to put his foot down into the trap.

Just then he knocks...

A POTTED CACTUS

Off the windowsill. It falls straight down into...

THE WOLF TRAP

Hitting the trigger. The jaws snap, obliterating the cactus.

A SHOTGUN BARREL

Snaps into view, pointing right at Tom's head.

EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET

Jim drives the boat down the street. Mr. Mehlor is scanning

the water with a flashlight.

Jim looks over to see...

THE JET-SKI

Floating in the water. And not far from it is...

KENNY

Still twitching.

OMITTED

Sequence omitted from original script.

INT. HOUSE - BEDROOM

Doreen holds the shotgun on Tom and Karen as they move away

from the window, hands raised.

They hear footsteps coming down old wood stairs.

Henry enters.

EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET

Jim and Mr. Mehlor pull Kenny into the ski-boat. Kenny is

shivering. Part of his hair has been burned away.

Mr. Mehlor looks at Jim. Mr. Mehlor knows these things and

he thinks Kenny is going to die.

Mr. Mehlor moves aside. Jim puts his arms around Kenny.

He looks up at Jim and grins.

Kenny's shivering stops. It stops because he's dead. Jim

slowly lets go.

INT. HENRY AND DOREEN'S ATTIC

Henry and Doreen have brought everything into their attic --

a TV, some silver and china, bowling trophies. A Coleman

lantern lights the room.

They look at him, surprised.

Henry ignores Doreen. He pushes the attic stairs down, heads

down them.

Doreen heads off down the stairs. Tom starts down the stairs,

stops.

They shake hands.

Tom nods and goes down the stairs.

EXT. HENRY'S HOUSE

Henry stands on the roof of the back porch, steadying a small

rowboat as Tom gets in. Doreen nags from the window.

Henry looks at Tom, entertaining the notion...

Henry sighs and lets go of the boat. Tom rows off.

LONG SHOT OF TOM

We see him in silhouette, crossing the gap between two houses.

JIM AND HIS MEN

Are watching, from the shadows on the dark side of the street.

EXT. CHURCH

The Sheriff sits in his boat, moored to the wall of sandbags

around the church. Wayne's boat is tied up next to it. The

floodwater is trickling over the top of the wall. The gas-

powered pumps inside the wall are keeping the waters at bay.

WAYNE AND PHIL

Come out of the front doors of the church.

EXT. ROAD OUT OF TOWN - WELCOME SIGN

Tom rows up to the truck and "Welcome" sign. His flashlight

shows just the top of the truck and sign. Tom looks at his

watch, ties the rowboat to the sign, jumps into the water.

A few moments pass, then Tom surfaces, holding a shotgun.

Then he senses something behind him and turns to see...

A COW

Floating in the water, tongue out, eyes glassy.

TOM

Kicks away, horrified. And then he hears an engine. He looks.

TOM'S POV

Jim's ski-boat is coming over the water. The engine cuts out

and the ski-boat drifts, a hundred feet from Tom.

A flashlight comes on, the beam swivels, illuminating...

HENRY AND DOREEN

Standing in the ski-boat, blinking in the light.

TOM

Slumps.

Jim puts a pistol to Doreen's head.

TOM

Thinks for a second, then throws the shotgun away and pulls

himself into the rowboat.

TOM, JIM, HENRY AND DOREEN

As Tom and Jim call to each other across the water, Doreen

goes at Henry.

EXT. MAIN STREET

The Sheriff, Wayne and Phil motor past the statue. Wayne is

driving his boat; Phil is with the Sheriff. The water is up

to the General's neck.

EXT. ROAD OUT OF TOWN

Tom helps Henry and Doreen over into the rowboat. As he does,

his face comes close to Henry's for a second.

EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET

Karen swims down the center of the street.

EXT. ROAD OUT OF TOWN

Tom is in the ski-boat with Jim. He looks out at...

HENRY AND DOREEN

As Henry rows them off into the darkness.

Henry starts to turn the boat around.

Henry turns the boat around and rows off. Doreen is silent.

JIM'S SKI-BOAT

Jim shakes his head. Tom looks at Ray, coughing and at Kenny,

dead. Tom doesn't know what to say.

EXT. STREET

The Sheriff and Wayne are motoring fast down a street, the

Sheriff leading. The Sheriff sees something in the water in

front of him. He curses and throttles down fast.

KAREN

Is in the water, exhausted and cold.

EXT. CEMETERY

Jim pilots the ski-boat into the cemetery. All are aghast.

A DOZEN CASKETS

Are floating in the water. Half of them have drifted up

against the fence; the others are headed that way.

Jim cocks the hammer on his pistol. Tom gets the hint.

Jim nods, gives the engine some juice and they move on.

TOM

Takes a quick look at his watch.

JIM

Sees Tom looking at his watch.

EXT. STREET

Karen is in the Sheriff's boat, wearing Phil's jacket, trying

to warm up.

EXT. CEMETERY

Jim throttles down the ski-boat engine.

Tom looks over at Jim, pretending to be confused.

And on Tom's look of disbelief...

INT. DAM CONTROL OFFICE

Hank is on the radio.

EXT. PARK AREA

The Sheriff is in his boat; Wayne is back in his own. The

Sheriff is on the radio.

CROSSCUT WITH HANK

EXT. CEMETERY

Tom looks down, not wanting to believe.

Tom suddenly lunges for Jim. Ray yanks Tom back.

Jim casually aims his gun at Tom.

Jim arches an eyebrow.

EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN THE SHERIFF

At the controls of his boat, moving fast, sprayed by rain.

Karen and Phil are in the back of the boat. Wayne is close

behind in his boat.

EXT. CEMETERY

Tom pauses, looks over to...

THE CRYPT

Just the top of it is visible. Two more COFFINS float nearby.

Jim steers the ski-boat over, hands Tom a flashlight.

Tom climbs over the edge of the ski-boat and into the water.

He turns on the flashlight and drops below the surface.

UNDERWATER

Tom shines his light on...

THE CRYPT

One end of a rope is tied to the crypt. The other end, cut

and frayed, is suspended in the water, waving in the current.

ON THE WATER

Jim watches Tom's light rise. Tom comes up fast, takes a

breath.

Ray grabs pistol in his belt. Before he can pull it out,

holes puff out of his chest, followed by blood and then the

sound of the rifle-shots. Ray tumbles into the water. A half-

second later there's...

HAIL OF BULLETS

Ripping into the ski-boat, water, trees, crypt.

THE SHERIFF'S BOAT, WAYNE'S BOAT

Are outside the fence, a hundred feet from the crypt. PUSH

IN FAST on...

THE SHERIFF

To the rescue. He and Wayne and Phil fire their guns.

TOM

Ducks underwater.

JIM

Pulls his pistol, returns fire.

MR. MEHLOR

Opens fire with a shotgun, shooting wild, yelling. Then he's

hit and knocked out of the boat, dead.

IN THE SHERIFF'S BOAT

The Sheriff stops shooting, yells at the others.

Wayne and Phil stop shooting.

BY THE CRYPT

Tom is holding onto a coffin, out of view of the Sheriff. He

hears a rush of bubbles and turns as...

JIM

Comes to the surface, breathing deep.

JIM'S GUN

Comes out of the water fast and the barrel goes to Tom's

forehead.

THE SHERIFF'S BOAT

There's an adrenal fire in the Sheriff's eyes. He starts his

boat forward, Wayne following. Their lights find...

JIM'S BOAT

No sign of life. Then there's a sound and the lights sweep

over to find...

JIM AND TOM

Climbing up on top of the mostly-submerged crypt. Jim is

behind Tom with his gun to Tom's head.

THE SHERIFF

Stops his boat. Wayne stops, too. They are thirty yards from

Jim and Tom.

KAREN AND TOM

A look passes between them.

THE SHERIFF

Thinks for a second, then shrugs.

He raises his rifle.

KAREN

Realizes what is about to happen.

TOM AND JIM

Also clue in, but before they can move...

THE SHERIFF

Squeezes the trigger as...

KAREN

Hits the gun with her arm.

THE RIFLE

Fires.

TOM

is grazed in the arm by the bullet.

THE SHERIFF

Smacks Karen hard with his rifle and she tumbles out of the

boat, unconscious.

TOM AND JIM

Throw themselves back off the crypt as...

THE SHERIFF AND WAYNE

Empty their guns in their direction.

JIM

Returns fire, shooting blindly over the top of the crypt.

PHIL

Reaches for Karen, floating limp in the water, but...

WAYNE

Is closer. He grabs Karen and pulls her into his boat, then

grins at Phil.

TOM AND JIM

Are behind the crypt. Tom holds his bleeding arm. Jim reloads.

No answer from Tom, but the answer is clear.

WITH THE SHERIFF AND HIS MEN

The Sheriff and Wayne reload.

The Sheriff, Wayne and Phil turn to see...

HANK

In his boat, right behind them, all dressed up in hunting

gear, rifle at the ready.

Hank is stunned. He doesn't answer.

Hank nods. He motions for Wayne to go one way; he'll go the

other. They start off. A blind shot comes from Jim behind

the crypt. The Sheriff shoots back. Phil finally musters up

the courage to say something.

The Sheriff fires off a flurry of bullets.

TOM AND JIM

Behind the crypt, bullets winging by. Jim looks over, sees...

HANK

Motor into view.

JIM

Opens fire.

HANK

Shoots back.

TOM

Flattens against the crypt, then turns to see...

WAYNE

Coming into view on the other side.

TOM

Looks at Jim, sees he's occupied in the fight with Hank.

Then he sees...

RAY

Floating in the water, dead, pistol still jammed in his pants.

TOM

Thinks, decides, and reaches out for Ray.

CLOSE ON JIM

Shooting at Hank. He hears gunfire from Wayne and is about

to swivel to shoot in that direction when he hears a gun

firing from right next to him. He turns to see...

TOM

Shooting back at Wayne with Ray's gun.

WAYNE

Pulls back out of the line of fire.

HANK

Curses and pulls back, too.

TOM AND JIM

Exchange a look.

THE SHERIFF'S BOAT

The Sheriff reaches down into a forward storage area of the

boat and pulls back a tarp revealing the bags of money.

The Sheriff rips his badge off and throws it away.

TOM AND JIM

Jim looks at Tom, then hands Tom his pistol. Tom doesn't

know what Jim's doing. Jim slips beneath the water.

HANK

Whistles and gets Wayne's attention. He motions Wayne to try

it again.

THE SHERIFF'S BOAT

BEHIND THE CRYPT

Tom is looking for Jim, to see what he's doing. And then...

WAYNE AND HANK

Come around on both sides.

TOM

Starts shooting at them with the two pistols.

WAYNE AND HANK

Pull back. As they go...

TOM

Sees...

KAREN'S ARM

Draped over the side of Wayne's boat.

TOM

Takes another shot at Hank but stops firing at Wayne.

CLOSE ON JIM'S SKI-BOAT

Jim's hand appears over the gunwale. He reaches in and

grabs...

MR. MEHLOR'S PACK

And pulls it out of the boat.

THE SHERIFF'S BOAT

Phil pulls out his revolver and points it at the Sheriff.

Phil is incredulous. The Sheriff weighs his hands like scales.

The Sheriff weighs the hands a couple more times. Phil slumps,

lowers the gun.

SOMETHING

Flies through the air; lands in the water by the Sheriff.

It's...

MR. MEHLOR'S PACK

And it starts sinking in the water.

BEHIND THE CRYPT

Tom sees...

JIM

Haul himself into the ski-boat.

THE SHERIFF, WAYNE AND HANK

Start shooting at Jim in the ski-boat.

JIM

Sticks the shotgun over the gunwale and returns fire.

TOM

Starts swimming for the boat.

THE SHERIFF, WAYNE AND HANK

See Tom and start shooting at both he and Jim when...

MR. MEHLOR'S PACK

Explodes and...

THE WATER

Erupts in a huge geyser.

THE SHERIFF, WAYNE, PHIL AND HANK

Are knocked off their feet. The Sheriff, Phil and Hank are

thrown into the water. Their boats are rocked up and back

and swamped with falling water.

JIM

Fires up his engine.

TOM

Is almost to the boat.

WAYNE

Gets to his knees in his boat and starts shooting.

TOM

Gets to Jim's boat and grabs onto it.

JIM

Cranks the throttle, and, dragging Tom, tears off under the

hail of Wayne's bullets.

TOM'S POV

As Jim races through the tombstones, barely missing

halfsubmerged stone crosses and crypt roofs.

TOM

Rams into one cross.

HIS HANDS

Start to slip from the boat.

JIM

Grabs Tom's hand and holds on as they shoot off across the

water.

THE SHERIFF, PHIL AND HANK

Get back in the boats.

EXT. ON THE WATER - MOVING

Jim hauls Tom into the boat. Tom lays on the bottom, catching

his breath. Blood is dripping down from his arm.

Jim gives Tom a look -- of course he wants that money.

Before Jim can answer, gunshots ring out behind them. They

look back to see...

THE SHERIFF AND HIS MEN

Coming after them in the three boats, shooting, closing.

Jim moves away from the wheel, giving it to Tom. Tom gets up

and takes over. Jim bends and picks up...

KENNY

Lifeless and limp.

JIM

Looks at Kenny for a moment, then pushes his body overboard.

WITH THE SHERIFF AND HIS MEN

Flying over the water.

THEIR POV

They see a body tumble out of the ski-boat.

WITH JIM AND TOM

Jim looks back, following Kenny with his eyes.

EXT. MAIN STREET

Jim and Tom make the turn onto Main Street. They look back

as...

THE SHERIFF AND HIS MEN

Come around the corner, two hundred yards back.

LOW ANGLE

Of the ski-boat, racing toward camera. As it gets closer,

the camera BOOMS DOWN underwater to reveal...

THE STATUE

The sword tip just below the surface. THE SKI-BOAT

There's a jarring metal on metal clank as the sword tip slams

into the propeller.

JIM AND TOM

Are thrown forward.

JIM

Slams head-first into the dash.

UNDERWATER

The propeller has stopped.

TOM

Looks back to see that...

THE OUTBOARD MOTOR

Has almost been ripped from its moorings.

No answer from Jim. Tom looks down.

JIM

Is laying on the deck, unconscious. Just then... BAM! BAM!

BAM!

HANK

Has his rifle resting on his boat's windshield and is firing

off a clip on automatic as he, Wayne and the Sheriff close

in.

TOM

Ducks down and tries to start the engine. No go. Again. It

catches on the third try. Tom guns it and the boat tears

off.

THE OUTBOARD ENGINE

Is wobbling, vibrating.

HANK

Keeps up his stream of gunfire.

TOM

Stays down, driving blind, as the bullets fly in, blowing

holes in the windshield. He looks at Jim, at the engine and

curses. He steers the boat toward...

THE CHURCH

All lit-up, brilliant white in the darkness, a quarter-mile

away.

EXT. THE CHURCH

The water is now over the sandbag wall. The first several

feet of the church are flooded.

THE SKI-BOAT

Comes up fast. Tom grounds it on top of the sandbag wall.

Tom hesitates for a half second before grabbing Jim and

pushing him out of the boat and into the water.

JIM

Hits the cold water and comes to, sputtering.

TOM

Grabs guns and ammo and jumps out of the boat and into the

water. He lays a rifle on the top of the sandbag wall and

fires off a clip.

THE SHERIFF, HANK AND WAYNE

Jim's bullets plug into their boats. They circle back.

AT THE CHURCH

Tom pushes Jim, still groggy, into the flooded church.

INT. CHURCH

Tom shuts the door. He piles the weapons on a shelf. He sees

Jim touch his head.

EXT. MAIN STREET

Wayne and Hank are alongside the Sheriff, engines idling as

they look at the church.

Hank nods, guns his engine.

Hank nods in agreement and takes off.

INT. CHURCH

Jim and Tom are by one of the stained glass windows, looking

out through a pale-colored pane at the Sheriff and his men

across the street. They watch Hank race off.

Tom touches the wound on his head.

Tom gives Jim a look then starts for the back of the church.

EXT. DAM

Water is starting to go over the top again. It pours down in

sheets over the face of the dam.

INT. CHURCH

Jim is by the window, looking out at the Sheriff and Wayne

across the street in the shadows. He turns as...

TOM

Enters from the back. He's got a bottle of rubbing alcohol

and a towel. He splashes some of the alcohol on the towel,

then touches it to his wound. It hurts like a sonofabitch.

After a beat...

Jim turns on Tom.

Jim looks away. After another silence...

Silence for a few moments, then...

Jim looks at him.

Tom thinks, nods and presses the towel to his wound again.

EXT. MAIN STREET

Wayne is thinking about something. He makes a decision and

flicks on his engine.

Wayne ignores the Sheriff and motors off.

But Wayne keeps going.

INT. CHURCH

Tom watches Wayne drive off with Karen.

Tom grabs a rifle, frustrated and angry.

EXT. MAIN STREET

Hank motors up to the Sheriff and Phil.

Phil looks scared shitless.

EXT. RESERVOIR DAM

Water continues to pour over the top. CLOSE ON CONCRETE

Chunks of cement are starting to wash away.

INT. CHURCH

Tom finishes reloading a gun.

Tom doesn't answer. He moves toward the front door. Jim cuts

him off.

Jim sees something out the window.

Tom sees what Jim sees.

THEIR POV

The Sheriff, Phil and Hank are heading toward the church,

flaming Molotov cocktails in their hands.

EXT. SIDE OF CHURCH

The Sheriff, Phil and Hank heave the flaming Molotov

cocktails.

THE ROOF

The bottles hit, explode. Sheets of fire rain down the roof.

ONE BOTTLE

Smashes through a window.

INT. CHURCH

Tom and Jim duck down as...

THE BOTTLE

Flies across the inside of the church and smashes against a

wall, sending sheets of fire down the wall.

EXT. CHURCH

The roof is on fire.

EXT. KAREN'S HOUSE

Modest, two-story, on a side street. The front door is open;

the boat tied up outside. There's a light on in the front

hall.

INT. KAREN'S HOUSE

Karen is unconscious. Wayne has her laying on the stairs

leading up from the entry area to the second floor. There's

three feet of water in the house. Karen's legs are in the

water. Her hands are handcuffed to a railing attached to the

wall, running up the stairs. Wayne stands over Karen, pats

her face.

Karen stirs, then starts slipping back into unconsciousness,

so Wayne splashes her face with water. Karen comes to,

sputtering. Her eyes focus. She looks up at Wayne. Wayne

grins.

Karen says nothing. Wayne leans in close.

Wayne pulls his gun, puts it to Karen's head.

Wayne straightens up, looks at her, then launches back into

it.

THE OVERHEAD LIGHT

Sparks and goes out.

Wayne heads off for the kitchen. The second he's gone...

KAREN

Raises her hips and digs a hand into her pocket and pulls

out her Swiss Army knife. She pries open the big blade. She

hears Wayne sloshing back toward her. She gets back into the

position Wayne left her in as...

WAYNE

Re-enters carrying two burning candles in candle-holders.

He sets the candles down on a dry step above Karen's head.

He leans in close.

Wayne reaches into the water, undoes Karen's rain pants,

yanks off her shoes, then pulls off her pants. He throws

them over the banister. Karen remains passive, blank. Wayne

takes off his holster; hangs it on the banister. Then he

pushes his pants down to his ankles. His shirttail is long

enough so that we don't have to see his wretched little

pecker. He climbs on top of Karen in the water, brings his

face close to hers.

KAREN'S HAND

Moves fast with the knife and...

WAYNE'S EYES

Pop open wide.

WAYNE

His head jerks back. He tries to shout, but all that comes

out is an awful gurgle. He tries to push off Karen, but...

KAREN

Wraps her legs around him, holds him close, pinning him.

WAYNE

Finally breaks free. He tries to stop the bleeding with a

hand, but the blood spurts through his fingers. He reaches

for his gun in his holster on the banister, but just as he

grabs it...

KAREN

Lashes out of the water with her legs, kicking Wayne in the

groin, pushing him back.

WAYNE

Tries to get his balance, but his feet can't move -- his

pants are around his ankles. He falls back into the water,

firing his pistol.

BULLETS

Blow chunks out of the wall next to Karen, hit the ceiling

and...

WAYNE

Is floating on his back, trying to lift the pistol, but his

strength is fading fast. He gets off one last shot and...

THE CANDLE

Nearest Karen is blown to pieces.

WAYNE

The gun drops into the water. No more shots. No more life.

He floats, pants around his ankles, covered in blood, dead.

EXT. STREET AND CHURCH

The church roof is on fire.

THE SHERIFF, PHIL AND HANK

Are across the street.

INT. CHURCH

Jim and Tom hear a creaking and look up.

THE CEILING

The fire has eaten holes in the roof. Embers come down.

EXT. CHURCH AND STREET

The Sheriff is getting very agitated.

INT. CHURCH

A small chunk of burning ceiling drops down. Jim and Tom

look up. Just then...

BRIGHT LIGHT

Floods into the church through...

THE STAINED GLASS WINDOWS

Filling the church with a kaleidoscope of colors.

TOM AND JIM

Look out the windows.

THE STAINED GLASS WINDOWS

Remain beautiful for a few more seconds until they shatter

and blow inwards as...

THE SHERIFF'S BOAT AND HANK'S BOAT

Come crashing through.

THE BOATS

Land, stop fast. The Sheriff's boat lands closer to the

pulpit; Hank's boat closer to the balcony.

THE SHERIFF, HANK AND PHIL

Look around. It's quiet for a moment. There's no sign of Tom

and Jim.

INT. KAREN'S HOUSE

Karen has her pants back on. She reaches out with one foot

and hooks Wayne's holster off the banister. She flips it

through the air and catches it with her hands. She opens

little leather pockets -- mace, more bullets. No keys. Karen

starts to panic.

She sees...

WAYNE

Still floating on his back, still dead. She looks closer

at...

WAYNE'S PANTS

Bunched around his ankles. And there, hanging from a belt-

loop is a ring of keys.

KAREN

Reaches out with her foot for Wayne's pants. She can't reach.

WAYNE

Is slowly drifting out the open door. Beyond the door, in

the light of the streetlamp, the water is riffling, moving,

and Wayne is heading toward it.

KAREN

Slides down further on the stairs, into the water, then stops.

CLOSE ON HANDCUFFS AND RAILING

There are metal supports going from the railing to the wall,

every three feet. Karen is prevented from going any further

down the stairs by one of these supports.

KAREN

Reaches out with a foot, straining, stretching her body,

almost dislocating her shoulder and...

HER FOOT

Just barely touches one of Wayne's feet, but then Wayne's

foot slips away and...

KAREN

Can only watch as...

WAYNE

Drifts out the door and is pulled away by the current.

EXT. RESERVOIR DAM

Water is cascading over the top of the dam. Chunks of concrete

are washing away.

INT. CHURCH

The Sheriff, Phil and Wayne scan the water, looking for

movement.

UNDERWATER POV

Looking up through a tangle of floating pews at the wavering

silhouettes of the boats and the men in them against the

burning timbers above.

TWO PISTOLS

Come into view, pointed up through the water.

ON THE WATER

The Sheriff, Phil and Hank have let down their guard for a

second when there's a series of dull, muted clacks from

underwater as...

BULLETS

Come streaking out of the water, winging by them, plugging

into the boats.

UNDERWATER

Jim fires the pistols, the bullets' bubble streaks knifing

up through the water.

THE SHERIFF, PHIL AND HANK

hit the deck in their boats, returning fire over the gunwales.

TOM

Surfaces over by the stairs up to the balcony, gasping for

air. He runs for the stairs.

BLAZING TIMBERS

Start to fall from the burning roof frame, hitting the water

with loud sizzling hisses.

THE SHERIFF, PHIL AND HANK

Turn to shoot at tom through the dropping flaming debris.

TOM

Disappears up the stairs, the bullets just missing him.

UNDERWATER

Jim runs out of bullets. He's long since run out of air. He

drops his guns and swims under the pews.

HANK

Looks up, realizing that Tom will be able to shoot down on

him. He reverses his boat fast under the balcony as...

TOM

Shoots down from the balcony, blowing a chunk out of the

prow of Hank's boat.

INT. KAREN'S HOUSE

The water is up to Karen's chin. Her hands are working

frantically beneath the water.

UNDERWATER

She's using the tip of the knife blade to unscrew the screws

holding the support to the railing. She's on the last one.

The blade slips, misses, gets a quarter turn, another quarter

turn...

KAREN

Spits out the water that spills into her mouth.

UNDERWATER

Another quarter-turn and the screw is loose enough to turn

by hand.

KAREN

Holds her breath with the water touching her nose. She gets

the screw loose, pulls up on the railing and pulls the

handcuff through the gap between the support and the railing.

INT. CHURCH

The Sheriff turns to Phil and nods re: Jim.

The Sheriff aims at the balcony as Phil scans the water,

looking for Jim.

UNDERWATER

Jim pulls an electrical cord out of a wall socket.

ON THE BALCONY

Tom ducks down as the Sheriff's bullets start plugging through

the wood front of the balcony. Tom moves away from the bullet

strikes, splashing through the water in the balcony.

CLOSE ON BALCONY FLOOR

As BANG BANG BANG -- bullets start shooting up from below.

HANK

Is firing up at Tom through the floor of the balcony.

TOM

Jumps back, startled, looking down at...

THE BALCONY FLOOR

Holes explode in the floor, sending up small geysers of water.

The water then starts whirlpooling down through the holes.

TOM

Moves back from hank's advancing bullet holes.

THE SHERIFF

Keeps firing.

TOM

Is caught between Hank's bullets and the Sheriff's bullets.

So he racks a load in the shotgun and dives backwards off

the balcony.

HANK

Is still shooting up as...

TOM

Arcs off the balcony, firing the shotgun under the balcony

at Hank.

HANK

Dives to the floor of his boat as Tom's shotgun blasts blow

plate-sized holes in the church doors.

TOM

Lands in the water and goes under.

THE SHERIFF AND PHIL

Look for Tom in the water.

HANK

Starts to get up from the bottom of his boat, searching for

a clip for his gun.

THE SHERIFF

Sees Tom's shape in the water and is about to shoot when...

JIM

Jumps up out of the water with the electrical cord. He tosses

a loop of the cord around the Sheriff's neck and pulls,

yanking the Sheriff out of the boat.

TOM

Comes out of the water, aiming his shotgun at...

PHIL

Who is aiming his pistol at Tom. Phil freezes.

THE SHERIFF AND JIM

Struggle in the water. Jim pulls the cord tightly around the

Sheriff's neck as the Sheriff tries to get a shot off at Jim --

he can't get the barrel pointed at Jim.

HANK

Fumbles with the bullet clip.

TOM

Turns his shotgun on Hank and pulls the trigger -- click. Uh-

oh.

TOM AND PHIL

Exchange a look.

HANK

Slams the clip into his gun and levels it at Tom.

PHIL

Points his gun at Hank.

BANG! and hank shoots Phil. Phil pitches back out of the

Sheriff's boat.

PHIL

Lands between Jim and the Sheriff, knocking them apart.

THE SHERIFF

Is free of Jim's grasp. He shakes off the electrical cord

and turns to shoot...

JIM

Who moves a little faster. He grabs Phil's pistol and puts

it to the Sheriff's head before the Sheriff can bring his

gun around.

HANK

Draws a bead on Jim and is about to shoot when...

TOM

Comes out of the water on the other side of Hank's boat. Tom

pushes down hard on the side of the boat.

HANK

Is rocked back, thrown off balance. He starts to spin and

bring his gun around when...

TOM

Swings with the shotgun, catching...

HANK

In the side of the head. Hank crumples and falls into the

water, taking his rifle with him.

JIM AND THE SHERIFF

Jim nods at the Sheriff's rifle.

THE SHERIFF

Hesitates, then tosses his rifle into the boat.

TOM

Grabs Hank's rifle and aims it at the Sheriff.

INT. KAREN'S HOUSE

Karen undoes a last screw in a metal support.

She pulls the handcuff through the gap between the support

and railing. She's at the top of the stairs.

THE END OF THE RAILING

Curves and goes into the wall.

KAREN

Tugs at the railing, tries rocking it up and down. It doesn't

budge. She starts chipping at the plaster with the knife.

THE WATER

It's up to her chest.

INT. CHURCH

The Sheriff hesitates.

And just then they all hear something truly ominous -- a

siren pierces the night.

INT. KAREN'S HOUSE

She reacts to the siren -- uh-oh.

INT. CHURCH

The siren wails.

Jim turns to look at Tom.

Tom doesn't know what to do. The Sheriff looks pretty pleased

with himself. He might just get out of this. And then...

They all look over at...

PHIL

Alive, but barely.

TOM

Looks at Jim, disappointed, angry, then hurries to Hank's

boat.

JIM

Climbs into the Sheriff's boat.

TOM

Climbs into Hank's boat. He starts the engine, looks down

at...

PHIL

Floating in the water, dying. A brief look between them,

then...

TOM

Drives the boat out through a shattered window.

JIM

Pushes the Sheriff out of the boat.

EXT. RESERVOIR DAM

A large V is being cut in the top of the dam by the raging

water.

A QUARTER-MILE AWAY

Looking back at the dam. The line of lights on top of the

dam start to fall over, then go dark, snuffed out by an unseen

force.

INT. CHURCH

Jim keeps his gun leveled at the Sheriff and Hank, standing

in the water, as he pulls the money bags up from the forward

hold.

Jim opens a money bag and smiles at what he sees.

INT. KAREN'S HOUSE

Karen tilts her head back to keep her lips and nose above

water. And then she hears a window smash. She turns as...

TOM

Wades in along the upper hall.

Tom reaches into the water for the railing.

He looks at her.

And then they hear a sound more ominous than the siren --

they hear the siren stop.

INT. CHURCH

Jim, the Sheriff and Hank react to the silence. Jim looks

off.

THE SHERIFF

Drops underwater.

JIM

Turns back at the sound of the Sheriff going under.

UNDERWATER

The Sheriff pulls up his pant leg.

JIM

Is aiming his gun at the water and is about to fire as...

THE SHERIFF'S HAND

Comes out of the water shooting a pistol.

JIM

Is shot in the gut and the thigh and high on the chest and

he stumbles back, bellowing, and falls out of the Sheriff's

boat and into the water.

INT. KAREN'S HOUSE

Tom starts hyperventilating.

Tom breathes deep then ducks underwater.

UNDERWATER

Tom flicks on his flashlight and starts swimming down the

stairs.

KAREN

Watches Tom and his light get swallowed up in the murky water.

INT. CHURCH

Phil is grabbing for the Sheriff's boat as the Sheriff and

Hank zoom out of the church, leaving him behind.

EXT. MAIN STREET

The Sheriff's boat comes onto Main Street, moving fast.

IN THE BOAT

Hank is looking back, in the direction the flood will come.

The Sheriff pushes Hank out of the boat.

HANK

Goes skipping over the water and slams into a streetlight

post.

INT. KAREN'S HOUSE

Tom swims down into the living room. His light shows a couch,

chairs, TV set. Books and newspapers are suspended in the

water.

EXT. THE CHURCH

The damaged ski-boat that Jim and Tom took to the church has

slipped off the sandbag wall and is drifting. A peaceful

scene. But then, from the distance, comes a rushing roar.

INT. CHURCH

Phil hears the roar. He looks around, lost.

EXT. STREET

Hank, groggy in the water, also hears the distant roar.

INT. CHURCH

The roar is building, getting louder. Phil sees something in

the water and reaches for it, frantically. He gets it. It's...

A BIBLE

And he clutches it to his chest as...

THE FLOOD

Hits the church.

INT. KAREN'S HOUSE - KITCHEN

Tom swims into the kitchen. He looks for the tall cupboard

by the fridge. He opens it.

INSIDE THE CUPBOARD

Hanging on a hook on the back wall is a saw. Tom grabs it.

EXT. MAIN STREET

Hank unwraps himself from around the lamp post. He looks

back.

HIS POV

Streetlights in the distance, winking out one by one, marking

the advance of the wall of water.

Hank looks around for safety. He sees it.

HIS POV

There's an alleyway.

HANK

Swims for the alley.

EXT. THE ADVANCING FLOOD

Roars through the town, pushing a rolling wave of debris,

obliterating anything in its path.

EXT. ALLEY

Hank swims into the alley. Hank looks for something to climb

up on, to hold onto. There's...

FIRE ESCAPE LADDER

At the end of the alley.

HANK

Swims for it. He hears the rushing roar of the advancing

flood. He expects the flood to blow by the end of the alley.

Wrong.

WALL OF WATER

Comes into the alley, banking high on the far wall before

coming down and barreling toward Hank. And what makes it

worse for Hank is that there's...

A CAR

At the front of the wave, being pushed by the water.

HANK

Dives clear just as...

THE CAR

Smashes into the wall, right where Hank had just been.

HANK

Relief in his eyes. He gets to the fire escape and is climbing

to safety when...

PROPANE TANK

Comes into the alley, rolling in the flood, spraying propane

from a torn hose. It explodes.

HANK

Barely has time to scream.

INT. KAREN'S KITCHEN - BREAK OF DAWN

Tom is threading his belt through the handle of the saw to

secure it. He gets it done and starts to swim out of the

kitchen.

BACK TO KAREN

Just Karen's lips and nose are above water.

IN THE KITCHEN

Tom is about to leave when everything starts to move --

rocking, from side to side, as if in a slow motion earthquake.

Cupboards and the fridge open and bottles and food and plates

tumble out.

EXT. KAREN'S HOUSE

The house has been hit by the flood. It's being pulled by

the massive current, stretching overhead phone and power

lines.

INT. KAREN'S HOUSE

Karen hears the groaning, ripping as the house tears free

from water and sewer lines. She's looking down for Tom when

there's a snap and the light above her goes out.

EXT. KAREN'S HOUSE

The house is carried on the current, turning in the water.

IN THE KITCHEN

Tom watches, astounded, as the room starts to turn around

him. He kicks fast for the door to...

THE LIVING ROOM

Tom swims in, fast, toward the stairs when...

A WINDOW

Caves in and...

HUGE TREE BRANCH

Smashes in, filling the room, blocking Tom's route to the

stairs.

TOM

Tries to get through the tangle of branches and leaves, but

can't. He swims over to another window and slides it up.

KAREN

Keeps looking down for Tom.

EXT. KAREN'S HOUSE

The house is impaled on a tree, the current sluicing around

it.

TOM

Surfaces near the side of the house, gasping. The current

starts ripping him past the house. He swims as hard as he

can back to the house, reaches out and grabs onto a gutter.

INT. KAREN'S HOUSE

Karen doesn't have much time left. The water is washing over

her mouth and nose. And just as she's about to go under...

TOM

Swims in with the saw. He starts sawing on the handrail.

Everything's going fine. And then...

THE SAWBLADE

Snaps.

TOM AND KAREN

Look at each other. Oh no. Karen's going under.

TOM

Sees something. He dives into the water.

KAREN

Can only watch and wait. What's he doing? Oh, Jesus. And

then...

TOM

Surfaces, holding Wayne's pistol. He puts the mouth of the

barrel to the handcuff chain, shields Karen's face, looks

away and pulls the trigger.

EXT. A TREE IN WATER

The water swirls through the branches of a half-submerged

tree.

HENRY AND DOREEN

Are in the tree. Henry is either unconscious or dead. Doreen

cradles him.

And Henry starts to come to.

Henry opens his eyes.

She hugs him tight and after a beat he hugs her back.

EXT. KAREN'S HOUSE

Tom and Karen swim out of a second floor window, grab the

rain gutter. Tom pulls himself onto the roof then grabs Karen

and helps her up. They crawl until they're clear of the edge.

Only the sloped roof of the house is visible in the swirling

water. They are just catching their breath when they are hit

by...

BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT

And they look to see...

THE SHERIFF

In his boat, shining a searchlight on them with one hand, a

gun in the other. He starts shooting.

TOM AND KAREN

Tom pushes Karen toward the peak of the roof as the bullets

plug in around them. Tom pushes Karen over the top then turns

and dives off the roof and into the water.

KAREN

Hears an engine behind her and turns.

A BOAT

Racing toward the house. It's...

THE SKI-BOAT

And at the controls is...

JIM

Barely alive.

THE OUTBOARD MOTOR

Is wobbling, vibrating at the back of the boat, almost loose

from its moorings.

JIM'S POV

He sees Karen, crouched below the peak of the house, a bright

light coming from the other side along with gunshots.

JIM

Pushes the throttle all the way forward.

THE SKI-BOAT

Shoots forward.

UNDERWATER

Tom swims hard toward the Sheriff's boat.

THE SHERIFF

Is shooting down into the water at Tom's moving shape.

THE SKI-BOAT

With Jim at the wheel, comes racing straight toward the house.

KAREN

Thinks he's going to turn.

THE SKI-BOAT

Doesn't turn.

KAREN

Rolls to the side, just getting clear as...

THE SKI-BOAT

Hits the sloping roof of Karen's house and ramps up it.

THE OUTBOARD MOTOR

Digs into the shingles of the roof and tears free from the

back of the boat.

THE SHERIFF

Hears the sound and looks up as...

THE SKI-BOAT

Comes over the peak of the roof.

TOM

Surfaces to see...

THE SKI-BOAT

Fly right over him, heading straight for...

THE SHERIFF

Who ducks down, just in time as...

THE SKI-BOAT

Misses him, landing just past him in the water.

THE SHERIFF

Straightens up, grinning with glee that the boat missed him.

And then he hears a piercing whine coming from behind him.

He turns, just in time to see...

THE OUTBOARD MOTOR

Flipping end over end, propeller whirring, heading straight

for him.

THE SHERIFF

Starts to scream.

CLOSE ON KAREN

Looking over the peak of the roof in horror. She hears the

Sheriff's scream and the scream of the propeller and then a

horrible ugly ripping and both screams stop.

THE SHERIFF'S BOAT

The Sheriff is gone. The side has been smashed out of the

boat and the boat is flooding with water.

THE SHERIFF

Is just some misshapen thing trailing red, floating in the

water.

JIM

Tries to restart the ski-boat but it's dead. He slumps

forward.

TOM

Sees Jim slump against the side of the boat.

Tom can tell Jim's anything but. Tom swims for the boat.

THE BOAT

Tom swims up, pulls himself in. He pulls Jim back off the

controls, sees the blood.

Jim looks at Tom. Tom understands -- Jim's not going anywhere.

Tom looks at Jim -- he knows Jim's lying.

Jim lets go of Tom.

Jim grimaces as he's hit by a wave of pain. He looks away.

Tom hesitates for a second.

Tom turns and slides into the water and swims away.

There's a last look between Jim and Tom, then Tom swims away.

Jim slowly topples forward and is still.

TOM

Swims through the swirling current toward Karen's roof.

JIM'S BOAT

Sinks below the surface and is gone.

TOM AND KAREN

Karen is down at the water's edge with her arm extended to

Tom. Tom grabs it, and as Karen pulls...

EXT. CHURCH - SUNSET

Karen pulls Tom up onto scaffolding running along the edge

of the new roof under construction. Tom holds a paper bag.

He's wearing work gear -- tool belt, work boots, etc. Tom

looks at the work being done on the roof.

And as they sit down and start to eat, the camera begins to

PULL BACK.
