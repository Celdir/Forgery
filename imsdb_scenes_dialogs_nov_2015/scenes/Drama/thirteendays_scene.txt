13 Days

David Self

DARKNESS.  As the MAIN TITLES BEGIN, the theater thrums with

a subsonic HISS which mounts in all the rattling power of

THX, and we...

BURN IN, BRIGHT LIVING COLOR:

EXT. STRATOSPHERE - DAY

The glory of stratospheric dawn.  The engines of a silver

Lockheed U-2F rasp upon the trace oxygen here at 72,500 feet.

Scattered cloud formations hang over the blue brilliance of

sea far, far below.  In the haze, the looming edge of land.

SUPER: FLIGHT G-3101. OCTOBER 14TH, 1962. OVER CUBA.

The spy plane's CAMERA DOORS whine open.  The glassy eye of

the 36-inch camera focuses.  And then with a

BANGBANGBANGBANG, its high-speed motor kicks in, shutter

flying.

INT. O'DONNELL BEDROOM - DAY

A simple CAMERA, snapping away furiously in the hands of a

giggling MARK O'DONNELL, 4.  He's straddling and in the face

of his dad, KENNY O'DONNELL, 30's, tough, Boston-Irish, with

a prodigious case of morning hair.  Kenny awakens, red-eyed.

Kenny sits up to the morning bedlam of the O'Donnell house.

KIDS screech, doors bang all over.  Kenny pushes Mark over,

rolls out of bed, snatches up the corners of the blanket and

hoists Mark over his shoulder in a screaming, kicking bundle.

INT. O'DONNELL HALLWAY - DAY

Kenny, with Mark in the bundle on his shoulder, meets his

wife HELEN going the other way in the hall with LITTLE HELEN,

1, in her arms.

They kiss in passing.  Daughter KATHY, 12, races by in angry

pursuit of her twin, KEVIN, 12.

Kenny dumps the bundle with Mark in a big pile of dirty

laundry.

EXT. MCCOY AIR FORCE BASE - FLORIDA - DAY

A pair of massive FILM CANISTERS unlock and drop from the

belly of the U-2.  TECHNICIANS secure them in orange carrying

cases, lock them under key, fast and proficient.  They whisk

them out from under the spy plane.

The Technicians run for an idling Jeep.  They sling the cases

into the rear of the vehicle which in turn accelerates away

hard, curving across the runway for another waiting plane.

INT. O'DONNELL KITCHEN - DAY

A kitchen out of the late 1950's.  Kenny drinks coffee, ties

a tie, rifles through a briefcase at the kitchen table.  The

horde of kids, ages 2-14, breakfast on an array of period

food.  Kenny grills the kids while he goes over papers.

KENNY JR. smirk at Kevin.

A PHONE RINGS as the kids cry out en masse.

Kenny glances up at the wall.  There are two phones, side by

side.  One RED, one BLACK.  It's the black one ringing.

Helen answers.  Kenny goes back to his papers.

EXT. STEUART BUILDING - DAY

A U.S. Navy truck lurches to a stop in front of the run-down,

brick-faced seven-story Steuart Building on 5th and K.  Rear

doors BANG open, and out hop two MARINE GUARDS, side arms

drawn, film canisters in a carrying case between them.

SUPER:  NATIONAL PHOTOGRAPHIC INTERPRETATION CENTER

(NPIC), WASHINGTON D.C.

As the Marines approach the building, front doors SLAM open.

INT. OPERATIONS OFFICE, NPIC - DAY

A bespectacled OPERATIONS MANAGER hands a clipboard to one of

the big Marine Guards who in turn hands him a set of keys.

The Manager unlocks the film cases.  PHOTO INTERPRETERS swoop

in, whisk away the contents: SPOOLS OF FILM.

EXT. O'DONNELL RESIDENCE - DAY

A black Lincoln pulls away from the modest white house on a

tidy Washington D.C. residential street.

EXT. WASHINGTON D.C., AERIAL - DAY

The car threads its way through the Washington traffic, past

the big administrative buildings, down tree-lined avenues,

takes a turn into a gate.  As the car stops at the gate, the

CAMERA flies past, revealing it's the gate to the WHITE

HOUSE.

INT. NPIC - DAY

CLOSE ON the five-thousand rolls of film spewing through

processing equipment, its streaking passage leading us

straight through the development machinery to:

A SERIES OF VARIOUS SHOTS:

Photo Interpreters power up light tables, stereoscopic

viewers, zip across the floor in wheeled chairs.

Flying switches, flickering lights, humming motors.  It's an

eerie dance of technological black magic.

Another pair of Interpreters loom out of the darkness, side

by side, ghostly looking, their glasses reflecting the glare

of the light table, like magicians staring into a crystal

ball.

IMAGES FILL THE SCREEN

Aerial shots, flashing by.  Cuban countryside from 72,500

feet.  A MAGNIFYING GLASS swings down on its arm in front of

us, magnifying the carpet of trees... and a row of six canvas

covered OBJECTS among them.

EXT. WHITE HOUSE - WEST WING - DAY

Kenny, in business suit and tie, trots up the steps, and a

MARINE GUARD snaps the door open for him.

INT. WEST WING - CONTINUOUS

Kenny, briefcase in hand, weaves his way through the empty,

ornate hallways of the West Wing.  Past magnificent doorways,

early American furniture, paintings.  He finally reaches a

doorway, goes through into:

INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

A long, narrow affair, window at the back looking out into

the Rose Garden.  Kenny dumps his briefcase on the desk,

shucks off his coat, removes a folder from his briefcase,

turns and heads back out...

INT. WEST WING HALLS - CONTINUOUS

And into the warren of offices and halls that is the working

White House.  He takes a right, passes the doors to the Oval

Office right next to his office, goes down a long, straight

hall, into...

INT. MANSION - CONTINUOUS

The formal main building, the executive mansion.  He passes

the busts of Presidents past, turns left into an elevator.

The doors close.

INT. 3RD FLOOR - FAMILY QUARTERS - DAY

The doors open.  Kenny strides out onto a DIFFERENT FLOOR,

the third.  He heads down the long, posh hall of the family

quarters.  Fine furnishings, art.  The living White House.

He approaches the double doors at the end of the hall guarded

by a cluster of SECRET SERVICE AGENTS.  An agent opens one of

the doors.

INT. PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Kenny enters the elegant bedroom.  The figure alone at a side

table by the window, drinks coffee, breakfast still spread

out before him, Washington Post obscuring his face.

The figure lowers the paper.

It is PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY.  He's wearing boxers and a

tank top.  Unshaven.  Bed-head.

Kenny O'Donnell, former ward-pol and long-time Kennedy man,

is his Chief of Staff...

The President rattles the paper.  Kenny collapses in the

chair opposite the President, sprawls, comfortable.

Kenny steals a piece of buttered toast off the President's

plate.  The President spares him a glance.

Kenny takes a defiant bite.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

SUPERIMPOSE: BUFFALO, NEW YORK

A luxury hotel crowded with LOCAL POLS: the Democratic

machine of Buffalo.  Beyond the open floor-to-ceiling

windows, a CROWD.  The Pulaski Day Parade, a glimpse of '69s

Americana.  High School bands blare Sousa.  The scene is

deafening, boisterous.  Pols trail Kenny as he crosses the

room: fast, tough, on-the-go.

And like that, a congressional candidate is made...  Kenny

accelerates, leaving the Pols behind.  Suddenly, outside the

windows, the crowd swells forward with a collective ROAR.

EXT. HOTEL - DAY

Kenny heads down the steps with New York Times Washington

Bureau Chief, SCOTTY RESTON. Anonymous, they weave their way

through the crowd for a police car on a side street.

Kenny just sighs as they make their way up to the police car.

A Secret Service Agent opens the door for him, another is

behind the wheel.

Scotty stares at Kenny, determined.  Kenny looks away.  And

his eye catches a tall, willowy BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.  She is

talking, excited, embarrassed, to two more SECRET SERVICE

AGENTS.  What they're saying is lost in the noise.

Scotty follows Kenny's gaze.  Then the two men share a look,

a silent understanding.  Kenny glances at the Secret Service

guy holding the car door, tilts his head at the woman.

The Agent nods, heads for the other Agents and the Beautiful

Woman.  Scotty acts like nothing has happened.

The formula's exactly what Kenny wants to hear.  He pretends

to consider, pretends to cave as he gets in the car.

Reston's won.  But so has Kenny, and he's made Scotty feel

tough in the bargain.  People like Kenny.

INT. POLICE CAR - DAY

In the back seat, Kenny stares out the window at the parade

goers.  The Secret Service Agents leave the Woman.

Disappointed, the Woman turns and vanishes into the crowd.

It's an eerie moment.  Something troubles Kenny, and he

glances up at the sky.  A premonition.  But it's a clear,

clear blue.  A day like this, all is right with the world...

INT. NPIC - NIGHT

Six Interpreters huddle around IMAGES on a light table.  One

of them shoulders his way into the group and THUMPS a black

BINDER on the table.  There are grim nods of agreement.

The book is open to a PICTURE of an SS-4 BALLISTIC MISSILE.

A photo from Moscow Mayday parade.  An icon of the nuclear

age escorted like some devil-god to a holocaust...

END MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE

EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - DAY

The White House casts long shadows this gorgeous October

morning.  Blue sky; the first flash of color in the trees.

SUPER: TUESDAY, OCTOBER 16TH, 1962.  DAY 1.

INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Briefcase and coat in hand, Kenny enters his office - and

finds THREE MEN.  Standing there.  Thin-haired, bespectacled,

academic-looking MCGEORGE BUNDY, 43, the National Security

Advisor.  The two men in the background: PHOTO INTERPRETERS.

Kenny hangs up his coat, sees the Interpreters' large black

display cases.  And suddenly the world is slightly off

kilter.

INT. WHITE HOUSE - RESIDENTIAL FLOOR - DAY

Kenny emerges from the elevator with Bundy.  They head down

the long, posh 3rd floor hall, the Presidential Detail

guarding the doors at the end.  But the familiar route feels

strange, and lasting an eternity.  Kenny eyes the package

under Bundy's arm, its TOP SECRET stamp visible.

The Agent opens the door.  Bundy pauses, Kenny with him.

Bundy is tense.  But Kenny relaxes.

INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Kenny's office is a raging beehive of activity.  Kenny works

the phone as ASSISTANTS come and go with files.

As Kenny THROWS the phone down at the receiver, and the

PRIVATE DOOR to the Oval Office suddenly opens.  Kenny

glances up.  President Kennedy stands there in the doorway.

Kenny thinks he's reacting to the tirade.

Kenny stops.

The Assistants leave, shutting the door after them.  Kenny

rises.

Kenny starts for the door.

The President lets Kenny by into...

INT. OVAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

WE ENTER from a different angle than we usually enter in

movies: through the side door.  The President's ornate desk

sits on the right, windows looking out on the Rose Garden

behind it.  Kenny's gaze swivels to:

THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM where the Interpreters, their

crewcut chief, ARTHUR LUNDAHL, 50's, and Bundy stare at him.

They're surrounded by PRESENTATION BOARDS propped up around

the fireplace.  The President's rocking chair and sofas.

In eerie silence, as all eyes follow him, Kenny makes his way

among the presentation boards with the U-2 imagery, stops in

front of the picture of the six canvas-covered objects.  It

unleashes a wave of memories.

He puts his hand out to touch the image, then turns and looks

to the President, knowing what they must be.

Shock.  Silence.  Kenny glances to the other men.

INT. WHITE HOUSE OPERATOR'S CENTER - DAY

A bank of WHITE HOUSE OPERATORS work the switchboard, fingers

flying, voices overlapping in a babble of:

INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - DAY

Kenny carries the phone with him as he paces hard from his

desk to his window.

Kenny hangs up.  The President enters.  A beat.  And in that

beat, there's a void.  The two men are off their emotional

stride, trying to grope their way out of shock.

Kenny nods, acknowledging the feeling

And we glimpse the chemistry of these guys by Bobby's

absence.  It's like they're missing their third wheel.

The President and Kenny hear him out in the hall.  And the

tension goes out of them instantly.

They turn to the door as BOBBY KENNEDY, 37, the President's

younger brother/Attorney General, enters.  Bobby shuts the

door behind him, falls into Kenny's chair, and clearly

grappling with his own disbelief, is hushed.

The President paces away, grim.

INT. WEST WING HALLWAY - DAY

The President strides down the plush hallway, Bobby and Kenny

flanking him.  Unconsciously, all three men assume the same

gait: confident, powerful, no longer disoriented.

And before our eyes, the three men's game faces appear, and

they become the hard-ass leaders of the United States.

Secret Service Agents throw open the massive double doors to

the Cabinet Room.

INT. CABINET ROOM - CONTINUOUS

And they enter.  The group of men at the long, ornate

Roosevelt-era table, rise as one.

And the doors close on the eighteen men of EXCOM: The

Executive Committee of the National Security Council.  They

are the legendary "Best and Brightest."

The President makes his way down the line: shakes hands with

Secretary of State DEAN RUSK, 53, distinguished, with a soft,

Georgian accent, a distant reserve.

The President leans past him, grasps the hand of the

Secretary of Defense ROBERT MCNAMARA, 46, a gifted managerial

genius... the price of which is a cold, hard personality.

OFF TO THE SIDE, Kenny greets Vice President LYNDON JOHNSON,

54, and ADLAI STEVENSON, 62, Representative to the U.N.,

intellectual, well-spoken.

The silver-haired war hero and politically savvy Chairman of

The Joint Chiefs of Staff, GENERAL MAXWELL TAYLOR, 50s,

shakes the President's hand.

He gestures to GENERAL MARSHALL CARTER, Deputy Chief of

Operations for the CIA.  Carter nods to the President.

THE CAMERA PANS OVER THE OTHERS.

DOUGLAS DILLON, ex-banker, Secretary of the Treasury.

ROSWELL GILPATRIC, studious Deputy Secretary of Defense.

PAUL NITZE, 55, the detail-driven facts man, Assistant

Secretary of Defense.

GEORGE BALL, 50s, Undersecretary of State.  Eloquent, a man

of conscience.

U. ALEXIS JOHNSON, Deputy Under Secretary of State.

EDWARD MARTIN, Assistant Secretary of State for Latin

America.

LLEWELLYN THOMPSON, laid back, rumpled Soviet Affairs

Advisor.

DON WILSON, Deputy Director of the USIA.

The President sits down at the center of the table, Rusk and

McNamara to either side, and the others resume their seats.

Bobby takes one of the over-stuffed chairs at the table.

Kenny finds one along the wall behind the President, under

the windows to the Rose Garden to TED SORENSEN, 30s, the

President's legal counsel and speech writer.  They greet each

other coolly.

The room falls silent.  The President looks across the table

to GENERAL CARTER.

Lundahl, standing at the end of the room with briefing

boards, steps forward with a pointer.

SWINGING THE POINTER AT A BOARD SMASH CUTS US TO:

EXT. MISSILE SITE - LOS PALACIOS, CUBA - DAY

The sweltering Cuban countryside.  Shouting SOVIET ROCKET

TROOPS, stripped to the waist, glistening with sweat, machete

a clearing under scattered, limp palm trees.

A bulldozer TEARS through the undergrowth.  FILLING THE

SCREEN.  A 70-foot long MISSILE TRANSPORTER creeps along in

the bulldozer's wake like a vast hearse with its shrouded

cargo.

INT. CABINET ROOM - DAY

Lundahl raps his second board: a map of the United States,

Cuba visible in the lower corner.  An ARC is drawn clearly

across the U.S., encompassing the entire Southeast.

The President stares at Lundahl, and beating out each word.

Lundahl looks around the room.  Everyone is hanging.

The men come to grips with their own fears, own anger.

General Taylor drops a memo on the table WHICH BECOMES:

EXT. FIELD TABLE - MISSILE SITE, CUBA - DAY

SCHEMATICS slapped down on a camp table.  A group of Soviet

site ENGINEERS point and gesture as they study their ground

from a shaded hillock.  CLEARING CREWS and SURVEYORS work and

sweat in the distance.

INT. CABINET ROOM - DAY

Taylor sees the grim looks all around.

Kenny lets out his breath.  He catches Bobby's eye.  This is

unbelievable.

There's angry agreement.  The President cuts it off.

Rusk glances to his team at the end of the table.  Ball,

Johnson, Martin, Thompson and Stevenson.

There's silence at the table.  Some nods.  Understanding.

And there it is.  The clock is running.

The room falls silent.  The President leans back in his

chair, studying the circle of men around the table, weighing

them.

Kenny and the others watch him in silence.  A long, dramatic

pause.  A course that will change history is about to be

chosen.  The President leans forward, folds his hands on the

table.  Fated.  Grave.

EXT. THE ROSE GARDEN - DAY

Kenny and Bobby follow the President down a path through the

Rose Garden.  The shock of the morning has worn off.  The

President stops, looks at them.

A long moment of silence as they move along again.

The guys stop again.  The autumn day is bright, warm, alive.

The air, the distant city sounds derail the relentless train

of logic for a beat.  And in their faces we see that all

three men, for the first time, feel the enormity of war, its

shadow over everything.  It's only a couple of steps away.

Steps that they're seriously contemplating.

Pained, the President turns away.

Kenny and the President look at him.  Bobby nods.

Kenny snorts a laugh.  Bobby shoots him a cross look.

The President stops.  Bobby and Kenny stop, too.

Bobby nods.

The President nods his approval.  Looks at Kenny.

INT. WEST WING - HALL OUTSIDE PRESS OFFICE - DAY

Kenny moves hard and fast through the twisting warren of

hallways and tiny offices which is the West Wing.  Suddenly,

Scotty Reston pops out of a doorway behind Kenny.

Kenny glances over his shoulder at Scotty who points to a

window.  A beat, then Kenny returns to look out the window.

Outside, the West Wing Drive is FILLED WITH LIMOUSINES.

A flash of dismay, but Kenny covers fast.

Scotty chuckles.  Kenny moves off, leading him away.  Kenny's

assistant runs up behind him, holding out a slip of paper.

Kenny tries to look him away.

Kenny turns, harsh

The Assistant eyes Scotty, holds his tongue.  Kenny takes the

slips.

That shuts Kenny up.  Reston eyes the slip, then looks to

Kenny's face.  And he knows something isn't right here.

INT. TREASURY BUILDING GARAGE - NIGHT

A car jolts to a stop.  The CAMERA PANS up over the sagging

suspension, the government plates, the hood ornament

revealing half of EXCOM inside.  Kenny stands nearby waiting

for them.

The doors open, and out they pile like a bunch of clowns:

Bobby, McNamara, Rusk, Ball, Martin, Dioptric, Sorensen,

Stevenson, and Nitze.  They're sitting in each others' laps,

banging their heads on the roof, joking, but tense.

The gang falls in behind Kenny, trails him out of the garage.

INT. TUNNEL TO WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

A steel door unlocks, swings open, and Kenny marches at the

head of the wedge of men into a long tunnel.  It's the

infamous old passage from the Treasury to the White House.

Kenny and Bobby get a little ahead of the others.

Kenny looks at him.  Then there's only one alternative.  The

CAMERA wipes through the ceiling to:

EXT. WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

GROUND LEVEL.  Where the brilliantly-lit flag flutters over

the spotlit White House: their destination.

INT. CABINET ROOM - NIGHT

GENERAL WALTER 'CAM' SWEENEY, head of Tactical Air Command,

stands at the head of the table with a presentation board.

The men of EXCOM gather around Sweeney in their rumpled

shirts, nursing coffee and cigarettes.

EXT. HOMESTEAD AFB - FLORIDA - NIGHT

An F-100 Super Sabre stands under lights on a taxiway.  The

CAMERA DESCENDS FROM ITS OVERHEAD SHOT, discovering the

aircraft's sleek cockpit, menacing tiger-jaw paint job, the

four 20mm cannons on its nose.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

The FLIGHT LINE where a full strike wing stands beyond this

plane, pylons laden with weapons, GROUND CREW servicing them.

INT. CABINET ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Other EXCOM members draw near the board, its order of battle,

strike maps.  They're grim, but fascinated.  Empowering.

Intoxicating.  Sexy.  Kenny sees it in the faces, even the

President's.  Adlai does too, is upset.

Kenny looks at Adlai.  The others around the room,

embarrassed, don't respond.  The group has moved on and

Stevenson hasn't.

Kenny looks around the room at the men, the murmurs of

general agreement, senses the consensus building and is

agitated.

The President leans back in his chair, turns to the man at

the far end of the table: DEAN ACHESON, 60s, former Secretary

of State.  He sits silent, like some revered oracle, the

architect of the American Cold War strategy of containment.

Acheson arches an eyebrow, and when he speaks, his voice

resonates throughout the room, powerful, smooth, hypnotic.

Everyone in the room listens to him with rapt attention, his

presence overshadowing the room, oracular:

Kenny stares at the old man.  Acheson's gaze finds his

through the cigarette smoke.  Acheson's eyes travel to the

President.

Taylor nods, vindicated.  The others murmur their approval.

Bobby, at the table in front of Kenny and to his left, trades

a dire look with Kenny.  This is happening too fast.  Bobby

holds his head, looks about at the others, deeply distressed.

The President sinks back in his chair, staring at Acheson.

Kenny eyes Bobby.  Bobby is writing something.

Bobby looks over his shoulder at Kenny, and REACHES BACK to

him with a folded NOTE.  Kenny takes it, opens it.

It reads NOW I KNOW WHO TOJO FELT PLANNING PEARL HARBOR.

Kenny gives Bobby a curt nod.  Bobby tilts his head at the

President: pass the note on to him.  Kenny rises, slips the

note in front of the President.

The President unfolds the note, and we HOLD ON IT and his

reaction as in the b.g., out of focus, Taylor speaks:

Bundy clears his throat.  Speaks from somewhere down the

table.

The President folds the note away, glances at Bobby.  A beat,

the President looks from Bobby to Acheson.

Acheson sits back in his chair, smooths his moustache.  A

dramatic beat, and then his ominous pronouncement rings out:

A chill runs down Kenny's spine.  He looks in shock to the

President.  The President remains calm.  But in place of the

fated look the President has had, there's a hesitation.

INT. WEST WING HALLS - NIGHT

Acheson strides down the hall, Taylor, Sweeney, Carter and

Bundy swept along behind him.  Bundy is on the defensive, the

others grim.

Bundy just nods.  Taylor grabs a door ahead for Acheson.

And the men head into a stairwell going down.

INT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT

Grimacing in pain.  He opens a pill bottle, takes two pills

out.  He takes a whiskey in a shot glass from Kenny.

RESUME

Kenny finishes pouring him and Bobby a couple of more shots,

discreetly turning a blind eye to the President's pain.

The President returns from his desk, shirt untucked,

disheveled, back stiff.  He eases into his rocking chair.

Bobby lies sprawled on the couch.  Kenny sits down.  They all

look at each other.  A beat, something like shock.

They burst out laughing.  An absurd, tension draining moment.

They shoot their drinks, Kenny refills.

The President stares Kenny in the face, understanding.

Kenny considers the President, his face straight as he says:

The President sees what Kenny's saying: it'd be an emotional

response, not necessarily the intelligent one.

Bobby picks up some reconnaissance photos on the coffee

table.

The President is rendered mute by a wave of pain.  Kenny and

Bobby aver their eyes.  When it passes, the President is

hushed, grave.

Kenny nods, moved.  The President reaches out for the

reconnaissance photos Bobby's flipping through.  Bobby hands

them to him.  The President looks them over.  And when he

speaks, there's humility.  And resolve.

EXT. AIRPORT - BRIDGEPOINT, CONNECTICUT - DAY

SUPER: WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 17TH.  DAY 2

A LONG SHOT of an ENORMOUS CROWD thronging a bunting-trimmed

platform.  The President, barely recognizable at the

distance, and a cluster of political VIPS wave from it,

smiling.

Kenny steps INTO FRAME, back here at the fringes of the

crowd.

The crowd goes nuts.  Kenny paces, checks his watch,

impatient to be done with the necessary diversion.  Kenny

gazes off to his right and spots Scotty Reston, along with

half the White House press corps suckered along.  Scotty

catches Kenny's look.

Kenny turns away, but Scotty comes weaving over.  The

President continues on, but all we hear is Scotty and Kenny.

But Kenny stands there, mute.  Reston just shakes his head,

knowing for sure something's up.  He turns and heads back for

the press corps.

Kenny and the President climb the stairs to the Presidential

plane, the crowd cheering him.  He gives a final wave.

INT. GEORGE BALL'S CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

EXCOM meets in George Ball's small conference room at the

State Department.  Bobby, in shirtsleeves, paces at the head

of the table, very, very alone.  All eyes are on him.

McNamara squirms.  The others react in frustration.  CIA

chief JOHN MCCONE, sharp, tough, conservative, is harsh.

And there's nothing Bobby can say to that.  He props himself

up on the table, stares at it as if there's an answer in its

shiny surface somewhere.  There is only the reflection of his

own face.

McCone, Acheson, and Taylor share a look.  The last

resistance to airstrikes is crumbling.  Finally, Bobby looks

up at McNamara.

McNamara suffers under the gaze of everyone at the table,

weighing the situation out.  And finally he ventures.

SUPER: THURSDAY, OCTOBER 18TH.  DAY 3

INT. OVAL OFFICE - DAY

Kenny enters the office from his side door in the middle of a

debate.  Military uniforms dominate the room: General Taylor,

General Sweeney, and a host of briefing officers.

The President stares out the window at the Rose Garden, his

back to Air Force Chief of Staff GENERAL CURTIS LEMAY, 60.

Beetle-browed, arrogant, the archetypal Cold War general.

Yet there is something about him, his intelligence perhaps,

that suggests he's playing a role he knows and believes in.

The only other civilians in the room are Bobby, Bundy and

McNamara.  The pressure from the military is almost physical.

The President continues staring out the window.  Kenny eases

over to the desk, leans on it, arms folded, interposing

himself between the President and the soldiers.  Bobby joins

him, side-by-side.

That makes the President turn around, stare at LeMay.

Taylor steps in softly, smoothly: good cop to LeMay's bad.

He spares a look at McNamara, who watches the fireworks, arms

folded, serious.

The President, partially defused, looks from Taylor to

McNamara.  LeMay steps forward, softer now, sincere.

Bundy is uncomfortable.  Everyone turns to him.  He nods.

Kenny realizes he's been co-opted by the military.  McNamara

does too, lets out a deep breath.  The President eyes Bundy,

then paces out from behind his desk, walks up to LeMay.

Kenny, Bobby and the President look at each other, unable to

believe what they just heard.

His pronouncement hangs there in the air: ominous, dangerous.

INT. WEST WING HALLWAY - DAY

LeMay walk out of the Oval Office with Taylor, Carter and

their staffers.

There are dark looks on the faces of the other officers.

They agree.

INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - DAY

As the meeting next door disperses, the President rummages

through Kenny's jacket which hangs on Kenny's chair.  Kenny,

bemused, holds out the package of cigarettes the President is

looking for.

The President glances up, takes the proffered smokes.

Bobby, Rusk and Sorensen enter from the hall.

INT. WEST WING HALL - DAY

Kenny comes out of the bathroom, and is buttonholed by the

crewcut, bullet-headed Press Secretary, PIERRE SALINGER, in

the crowded, busy hallway.

Kenny wheels back into his office.  It's filled with people.

But he bends confidentially to Pierre's ear.

INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - DAY

The Press Corps throngs Kenny's tiny office, pushing and

shoving for a vantage at the side door to the Oval Office,

waiting for the Gromyko photo-op.  Kenny stands shoulder-to

shoulder with Reston and Sorensen near the door.

Kenny doesn't even blink, but Sorensen does a poorer job at

hiding his reaction.

Fortunately, the conversation is cut short as a dozen

FLASHBULBS suddenly go off on a dozen cameras as the

reporters crush in on the Oval Office, and Reston is swept

forward.

KENNY'S POV:

over the reporters.  The President, unsmiling, enters the

room beside Soviet Foreign Minister, ANDREI GROMYKO.  Gromyko

pauses for the photos: grim, dark haired, saturnine.

RESUME

Kenny reacts.  At last, the face of the enemy.

INT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT

The CAMERA picks up the darkened windows: the meeting has

gone long.  The CAMERA MOVES PAST Kenny and Sorensen standing

in the doorway to Kenny's office, FINDS the President in his

chair across from Gromyko on the sofa.  Rusk, Ambassador

ANATOLY DOBRINYN, and two INTERPRETERS around them.

The President stares at Gromyko as the translator finishes

translating.  Gromyko sits there, enigmatic, cold,

unreadable.  The translator finishes, and Gromyko stops him

with a gesture so he can answer in his own accented English.

The President hides his fury masterfully, and gazing over his

glasses, asks:

A beat.  And Gromyko's response is flat, sure, steady:

Kenny's blazing eyes could drill holes in the back of

Gromyko's head.  His gaze swings to the PRESIDENT'S DESK.

BENEATH THE DESK sit the BRIEFING BOARDS with the evidence.

INT. WEST WING HALLWAY - NIGHT

Kenny emerges from his office.  The Soviet delegation

disappears down the hallway with Rusk.  Kenny turns as Bobby,

haggard, comes up from the other direction.

Bobby gestures to the vanishing delegation, now being

HARANGUED OC by the press.

The President comes out of the next door down the hall, the

Oval Office.  He turns and sees Kenny and Bobby.  He's livid.

The prospect disturbs the three men.

The President spins on him, unsure he heard correctly.

The President pauses, looks at Bobby.  Bobby shakes his head:

don't look at me.

INT. HALLWAY - SHERATON-BLACKSTONE HOTEL - NIGHT

SUPER: FRIDAY, OCTOBER 19TH.  DAY 4

THEN SUPER: CHICAGO

Kenny threads his way through the host of SECRET SERVICE

AGENTS and ADVANCE MAN cramming the hallway on the floor of

the hotel they've taken over.  From one of the rooms emerges

Salinger.

Kenny stares at him, and the light dawns on Pierre.

Something big is going on and he's been cut out of it.  He

stalks off.

INT. RECEPTION HALL - SHERATON-BLACKSTONE - NIGHT

A big 100-dollar-a-plate dinner is in full swing to a dinner

band's tunes.  The President and Chicago MAYOR RICHARD DALY

make the rounds among the fund raising CROWD.  Kenny follows

them at a respectful distance, greeting old cronies.

Suddenly a MESSENGER hustles over to Kenny, hands him a note.

Kenny makes eye contact with the President, nods and leaves.

INT. HOTEL ELEVATORS - NIGHT

Kenny waits at the elevator.  Scotty saunters up behind him.

He sizes Kenny up, clears his throat.  Kenny turns around.

Kenny freezes, then explodes.

Reston is taken aback.  Stung silence for a beat.  Kenny's

response is far louder than any "yes."  Now Kenny realizes

it.

And Kenny looks away, upset, but when he turns back to

Reston, all that's there is his poker face.  The elevator

arrives.

Kenny boards the elevator.  The doors shut on Scotty.

INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

Kenny closes his eyes, sags against the wall, hating himself.

INT. KENNY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Kenny enters his hotel room.  An Assistant waits with the

phone, hands it straight to Kenny.

INT. OUTER ROOM - GEORGE BALL'S OFFICE - NIGHT

EXCOM files past Bobby out of George Ball's conference room.

EXT. STREET OUTSIDE SHERATON-BLACKSTONE HOTEL - DAY

SUPER: SATURDAY, OCTOBER 20TH.  DAY 5

The President emerges from the hotel, a HAT on his head.  The

Press and a CROWD surge forward, crying out for the

President's attention.  Kenny slides into the limo first as

the President waves to the crowd.

Salinger waits on the sidewalk, and after the limo pulls

away, the Press pushes in on him.  Pierre's face is pale -

he's just been told everything.

INT. WHITE HOUSE MANSION - OVAL ROOM - DAY

The White House Oval ROOM: opulent, filled with priceless art

and furniture, but cramped.  EXCOM members crowd around the

center coffee table and the President.  Kenny stands behind

him with Bobby.  Rusk rises from his seat, formal.

At long last... Kenny looks at Bobby, relieved.  They've

bought time to find a settlement.  Bobby smiles a small

smile: what were you so worried about?

McNamara folder in hand, opens it, SMASH CUTTING US TO:

EXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN - DAY

A SOVIET FREIGHTER churning its way south.

The CAMERA races along its side, discovering TARPULINED

OBJECTS on deck, and on its stack, the RED HAMMER AND SICKLE.

The Destroyer U.S.S. JOHN R. PIERCE putting out to sea,

SAILORS racing over its deck, through hatches to its 5-inch

gun turrets.  The ship races by, AMERICAN FLAG streaming from

its stern distaff, FILLING THE SCREEN, WIPING TO:

INT. WHITE HOUSE MANSION - OVAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The President.  He listens, looks over the briefing papers as

McNamara continues.  Everyone watches the President.

The President gazes from one expectant face to another.  But

he himself remains unreadable.

Adlai clears his throat.  Everyone looks over at him.  He

stares down at his clasped hands for a beat.  He's anguished

about what he's going to say.

He smiles weakly, but gets no response from anyone.

Adlai looks for support around the room, but meets only stony

gazes.  From McCone and General Taylor, contempt.  Dead

silence for a long, long beat.

Kenny's heart goes out to Stevenson as he watches the man

commit political suicide.  Even Sorensen, standing behind

him, unconsciously moves away.  At last the President speaks.

EXT. TRUMAN BALCONY - DAY

Kenny, Bobby, and the President lean on the railing of the

Truman Balcony, stare out at the city.

He stares out at the Ellipse where a little-league football

game sweeps across the grass, the shouts and screams of the

CHILDREN, so alive, floating to them on the wind.

EXT. PATIO - JIM ROWE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A crowded D.C. party spills out of Jim Rowe's house onto his

patio.  Kenny steps INTO FRAME.  He looks at the PARTYGOERS,

the Washington social set.  He stands out, oppressed by the

knowledge he's unable to share.  He takes a stiff drink.

Suddenly out of the house totters Adlai, highball in hand.

Glassy-eyed, he grins at Kenny and joins him.

Kenny shrugs.  Adlai takes a long drink, closes his eyes.

Kenny has no answer to that.  He looks down, pained for

Adlai.

INT. BEDROOM - JIM ROWE'S HOUSE - LATER

Kenny, shut in the bedroom, paces on the phone.

New York Times publisher ORVILLE DRYFOOS sits at his kitchen

table in his underwear, still half-asleep, phone to his ear.

INT. PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

The President, on the phone, stops pacing by his bedside

table and exhales.

INT. ORVILLE DRYFOOS' KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

INT. PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

INT. ORVILLE DRYFOOS' KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

At that, Dryfoos sits up.  Serious.  All resistance gone.

INT. ST. STEPHEN'S CHURCH - DAY

SUPER: SUNDAY, OCTOBER 21ST.  DAY 6

AVE MARIA soars over the communion meditation at a crowded

Sunday mass.  Kenny, in a pew, glances off to his left.

The President sits nearby, head bowed.  But Kenny knows he's

not thinking about the mass.  And when the President at last

lifts his head, Kenny sees the calm poise.

The President has made up his mind...

INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - DAY

Bobby barges into Kenny's office.  Kenny, knowing his unique

entry, doesn't bother to look up.

Kenny finally looks up.  Bobby's grim.  And an icicle forms

in Kenny's gut as Bobby relays.

INT. OVAL OFFICE - DAY

Kenny, Bobby, McNamara, Rusk, Bundy and half of EXCOM stand

to the side of the room.  General Sweeney and LeMay stand in

front of the President's desk.

The President, bowed in the window, is care-worn, a thousand

years old.  The shadow, the composition of the SHOT tells us

all.  It's down to what's in the heart of one man.  Kenny is

deeply moved at his friend's Gethsemane.

Sweeney glances at LeMay.  LeMay's stern, frozen look wills

him to say, very simply, "yes."

But then the President turns around, looks Sweeney in the

eye.  It would make Machiavelli himself tell the truth.

The President holds Sweeney in his gaze.  Thank you.

The President doesn't respond to LeMay's last-ditch appeal.

Ninety-percent isn't good enough with nuclear weapons.  He

moves to his desk, signs a paper, hands it to General

Sweeney.

EXT. BARKSDALE AFB - SUNSET

SUPER: MONDAY, OCTOBER 22ND.  DAY 7

A DEAFENING WHINE.  And INTO FRAME yawns the enormous

spinning mouth of a B-52 bomber jet engine.  It closes on us,

sucking us in like a maelstrom, but at the last second the

CAMERA SLIPSTREAMS OVER IT --

-- carrying us over the aircraft's wing.  The CAMERA pivots

and the vast war machine crawls away underneath joining --

-- a long LINE of identical behemoths, in single file inching

down a taxi way which vanishes into the distance.  As the

plane's immense vertical tail WIPES OUR VIEW:

EXT. MISSILE SILO - NIGHT

The CAMERA races toward a spotlighted concrete emplacement,

over the immense BLAST DOOR which is sliding open, and DOWN --

INT. MISSILE SILO - CONTINUOUS

-- into the depths of a missile silo.  The CAMERA speeds down

the side of the Titan missile, through CLOUDS of steaming

liquid hydrogen, past FUELING HOSES which clamp one by one to

the rocket's side, past GANTRY ARMS pulling away.  The CAMERA

hurtles all the way to the bottom, SMASHING THROUGH THE FLOOR

TO:

EXT. CARRIBEAN SEA - NIGHT

The dark ocean, whitecaps whipping luminous around the

aircraft carrier, U.S.S. ESSEX and her escorts.  Running

lights flash red and green.

The carrier's SIREN begins a lonely, eerie WOOP WOOP WOOP

WOOP like some immense creature which has lost its mind.  The

ship FILLS THE SCREEN, CUTTING US INTO:

INT. WEST WING - CONTINUOUS

The doors to the Cabinet room.  A beat.  Then they SWING

WIDE.  The President emerges, livid fury on his face, leaving

chaos behind: the Congressional briefing.  Kenny comes out a

beat later, catches up with him.

The President exhales, getting control.

INT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT

Kenny stands there in the doorway, arms folded.  As we PULL

AWAY FROM HIM, we REVEAL the three NETWORK T.V. CAMERAS

staring straight at us.  Their red lights go on as one, and

we swing around REVERSING TO:

The President at his desk: telegenic, powerful.

EXT. BARKSDALE AFB - NIGHT

The first B-52 trundles to a stop at the end of the runway.

It begins to throttle-up, the ROAR of its engine mounting...

-- AND DROWNING OUT the President's speech as the plane

lurches forward, down the runway into the night.

EXT. MISSILE SILO - NIGHT

The Titan solo door GRINDS OPEN.  And the missile inside

begins to rise into the white bath of the crossed spotlights.

EXT. CARRIBEAN SEA - NIGHT

The President's words conjure the ESSEX battlegroup, its

destroyers plunging through heavy seas, lit up in the night.

EXT. OVER THE FLORIDA STRAITS - NIGHT

A flight of F-4 PHANTOMS drops INTO FRAME, lights flashing.

INT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT

A beat.  And the President looks up from his notes.

The chilling words hang there in the air.  BLEEDING IN: the

rising and falling WOOP WOOP WOOP WOOP which becomes --

EXT. CARRIBEAN SEA - NIGHT

-- the voice of the Essex battlegroup: sparkling, alive, a

constellation of lights scattered across the sea.  One by one

the escort ships answer the carrier's SIREN with their own

wailing cries, an alien chorus among the ships, disappearing

and reappearing in the swells.  The communication crescendos

to its fever pitch --

-- and then the battlegroup goes to blackout.  Like a dying

universe, the answering sirens cut off, the life-lights wink

out, and an appalling darkness falls across the sea...

FADE OUT

BLACKNESS, LIKE BEFORE A CURTAIN RISES.  And then a

flickering: a FLUORESCENT LIGHT COMES ON.

INT. BATHROOM - WEST WING - DAY

SUPER: TUESDAY, OCTOBER 23RD.  DAY 8

Kenny, stripped to the waist, Sorensen and Bundy shave in

nearby sinks.  Bobby barges in.

INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

Specks of shaving cream still on his face, Kenny paces, reads

the inky carbon as Bobby, Bundy and Sorensen read copies.

Kenny looks up.  The President enters from the Oval Office.

INT. CABINET ROOM - DAY

Kenny, arms folded, stands behind the President, the rest of

EXCOM is looking at him.

ADMIRAL GEORGE ANDERSON, 50s, dapper, the Chief of Naval

Operations, nods from the far end of the table.

Anderson signals A BRIEFING OFFICER who hits the lights and

an overhead projector which SMASH CUTS TO:

INT. BRIDGE - U.S.S. JOHN R. PIERCE - DAY

The bridge of the U.S.S. John Pierce, a Gearing class

destroyer.  A RADIO OPERATOR addresses a mike in Russian.

INT. WEAPONS' LOCKER - U.S.S. PIERCE - DAY

MARINES in flak jackets grab M-16s off a rack, race by.

EXT. U.S.S. PIERCE - AFT DECK - DAY

A ship's boat full of Marines lowers away, hits the water,

engine spraying as it launches forward - in dress rehearsal.

INT. CABINET ROOM - DAY

All eyes are on Admiral Anderson's overhead projections.

Bobby, restless, gets up, begins pacing.

Bobby stops, stares directly at the Admiral.

Kenny looks at the President who remains unmoved, unreadable.

The President glances at McNamara.

He pushes Ecker's personnel file across the table, and as the

President opens it, on ECKER'S PHOTO, we SMASH CUT TO:

INT. READY ROOM - KEY WEST NAVAL AIR STATION - DAY

The man himself, COMMANDER BILL ECKER, 30s, playing cards,

smoking cigars with his wingman, LIEUTENANT BRUCE WILHEMY and

the PILOTS of VFP-62, the 'Fightin' Photo.'  They lounge,

tinker with equipment.  Their ready room is filled with pin

ups, movie posters, and all things photographic.

The other pilots heckle him, but are muted by Taylor.

INT. CABINET ROOM - DAY

EXCOM listens in sober silence.

Kenny catches the President's eye.  Kenny glances at the

door.  Step outside, I need to talk to you.

INT. OVAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

The President and Kenny stand in front of the President's

desk.  All the doors are shut.  Weak sunlight filters into

the hushed room as if to a confessional.

Kenny's right, and the President looks away in frustration.

Thep President stares intently at Kenny.  Kenny glances at

the door, his voice hushed.  He hesitates.

The President understands.  He shakes his head, paces away.

The President turns away, considers.  Then turns back.

Jesus Christ...Kenny is daunted.  For a beat he just stares.

INT. WEST WING HALLS - DAY

Kenny and the President head for the Cabinet Room.  Rusk

comes out before they get there.

The President moves for the Cabinet Room.

Kenny slaps the dismayed Rusk on the back, heads off down a

hall away from the Cabinet Room.

INT. WHITE HOUSE SWITCHBOARD - DAY

Kenny opens the door to the White House switchboard room.  A

half-dozen OPERATORS work their lines, making connections on

the old-fashioned switchboard.  Unnoticed, he sizes them up,

their skill.  They're all courteous, pretty, professional.

The CAMERA PANS down the line... and stops on a middle-aged

matron at the end - the sternest, most scary of them all.

Her name is MARGARET.

Her voice is so severe, so smoker-gravelled, it makes the

blood run cold.  This is the woman Kenny's looking for.

INT. READY ROOM - KEY WEST NAS - DAY

Ecker, Wilhemy and their Pilots are in angry debate.

Nearby, a YOUNG PILOT tinkers with a $300,000 spy camera.

Suddenly, the door opens and a pale DUTY SERGEANT enters.

INT. DUTY OFFICE - DAY

Ecker enters, marches over to the phone.  All the SOLDIERS in

the room stare at him.  Ecker wiggles his cigar to a corner

of his mouth, picks up, styling.

INT. WHITE HOUSE SWITCHBOARD - CONTINUOUS

Margaret works her magic.

INT. DUTY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Ecker blinks, becomes a mild lamb.

INT. WHITE HOUSE SWITCHBOARD - CONTINUOUS

BEGIN INTERCUT

INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Kenny, sitting on his desk, taps his fingers, looks at the

phone.  He's kept Ecker on hold long enough - and picks up.

INT. DUTY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Ecker exhales.  It's not the President, but Ecker is so

shaken up it might as well be.

Did he hear right?

INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

INT. DUTY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Ecker sits down in a chair, sobered.

INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Kenny stands, drops the hard nose bullshit.

INT. DUTY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Ecker lets out a long breath.

INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Kenny nods to himself, feeling.  He's done it himself.

INT. DUTY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Ecker doesn't want to be avenged with atomic weapons.  No

sane person would.

Ecker down, deeply affected.  Suddenly, A BELL RINGS.  A

TELETYPE goes off.  Ecker knows it's for him.  His orders.

END INTERCUT.

As Ecker hangs up, the Duty Officer rips off the ORDERS,

hands them to Ecker, who takes one look, then gazes out the

window at the runway --

EXT. RUNWAY - KEY WEST NAVAL AIR STATION - DAY

A CART speeds down the flight line past the waiting F8U-1P

Corsairs.  One by one, the four pilots accompanying Ecker and

Wilhemy jump off to mount their planes.  The cart still

moving.

Wilhemy jumps off, then they're at Ecker's plane, and he

jumps off.  Too late to worry about bad fuel now.  He hoists

himself up and into the cockpit of the sleek navy jet.

As the canopy closes, Ecker powers up the engines, talks to

his flight over the Guard channel.

EXT. RUNWAY - DAY

The Crusaders swing around in pairs at one end of the runway,

and then the first two throttle-up, flaps down, and drop

their brakes.  The machines LUNGE forward like duelling drag

racers.  The FILL THE SCREEN, blow past.

EXT. AERIAL - OVER KEY WEST - DAY

The six Crusaders, in pairs, streak over the buildings and

streets of Key West.  And in a heartbeat, cross the beach and

are out to sea.

And already on the horizon, the low clouds and dark line of

land.  Cuba.  Ninety miles away.

INT. ECKER'S CRUSADER - DAY

The ocean shrieks past so close you can see the white foam.

Ecker checks the altimeter: 150 FEET.

A small fishing boat looms ahead, its net booms reaching up

like tree limbs.  The Crusader rockets over it.

Ecker checks his instruments.  OUT THE WINDOW, the other

Crusaders thunder over the water, past sailboats, cabin

cruisers, the small-craft traffic outside Key West.  The

speed sucks the breath away.

His airspeed indicator spins up to 400 knots.  And then his

radio suddenly crackles:

Two of the Crusaders pull up, away from the water.

EXT. AERIAL - CRUSADERS - DAY

The two planes with bad fuel pull wingovers to their left,

head for the airfield in the distance.  The four remaining

planes streak over the ocean.  There are no more small craft

this far out in the strait.

INT. ECKER'S CRUSADER - DAY

Cuba, green and hazy, looms in the window.  Ecker throws a

series of switches.

A mechanical WHINE accompanies the switch-throwing.  Ecker

pulls the trigger on his joystick and a THUMP THUMP THUMP

hammers away.  There are green lights across his boards.

One of the other pilots cuts in on the radio:

Ecker grimaces, but his voice stays cool.

The two Crusaders who've failed their camera checks break

off.  And now Cuba's hills, the Havana sky line are right in

front of them.

EXT. CUBAN BEACH - CONTINUOUS

The last two Crusaders streak over the surf, a white wake of

spray in their jetwash, and cross the beach with a boom.

EXT. AERIAL - CRUSADERS - CONTINUOUS

The planes dip and rise with the green tropical contours,

taking us on a sickening roller-coaster ride over Cuban

countryside at treetop level.

Palm forest, roads, can fields, more palm forest race by.

And then, ahead, a large clearing.

EXT. ANTI-AIRCRAFT BATTERY - CONTINUOUS

Cuban ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUNNERS shout as they traverse their 40mm

guns in their sandbagged emplacement.  The low rippling

thunder of the incoming jets becomes an earsplitting ROAR...

and the Crusaders blast out over the clearing.  The anti

aircraft guns open up.

INT. WILHEMY'S CRUSADER - CONTINUOUS

Wilhemy jinks left to avoid a streaking of TRACER FIRE.

INT. ECKER'S CRUSADER - CONTINUOUS

Tracers and flack pepper the air in front of Ecker's

Crusader.  METAL PINGS, TINKS, RATTLES off the fuselage.

Anti-aircraft and small arms fire comes up from all over,

hitting the planes multiple times.  He surveys the shapes in

the target zone dead ahead.

And sees the long, canvas-covered objects on the ground.  The

missiles.  They draw closer.

A steel fragment CRACKS his window, obscuring our view.

And he thumbs the CAMERA SWITCH.  All twelve B-system cameras

begin banging away like cannons.

EXT. AERIAL - CRUSADERS - DAY

TRACERS lace the air between the two planes as they blast

over the missile site.  Over trailers.  Over tents.  Over

trucks.  Over trenches.  Over bulldozers.

And then they're out over forest again.  It's all over in

seconds.  The triple-A stops.  In unison, the two planes bank

right, heading for the distant blue, blue sea.

INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - DAY

Kenny paces by the phone.  It rings.  He picks up, listens,

reacts.  Relief.  And we know the planes have made it back.

EXT. RUNWAY - CECIL FIELD, FLA. - DAY

Ecker jumps down from the cockpit ladder and turns an eye to

his battered, pock-marked plane.  Wilhemy and the GROUND CREW

CHIEF come running up, the Chief letting out a whistle.

Wilhemy stands there, looking at Ecker, not sure what to make

of him.  The Crew Chief just starts laughing as more

impressed GROUND CREW come up.

Ecker, sweat-plastered and foul, steps into the Chief's face.

The Chief stands there, glances at the plane one more time,

and shakes his head, 'No.'  Ecker takes the Chief's

maintenance clipboard from him, writes in big bold marker:

BIRD STRIKES.  He thrusts it back into the Chief's hands and

walks off; the astonished Wilhemy remains behind.

INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - DAY

In Kenny's credenza, a small black and white T.V. plays.

WALTER CRONKITE narrates on the television as a train laden

with TANKS on flatbeds pulls out of a station.

A PHONE RINGS.  Kenny turns from the T.V., turns down Walter

Cronkite, as he answers.

INT. OAS MEETING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

George Ball stands at the back of a crowded room filled with

applauding OAS DELEGATES.  It's for Rusk, at a podium up

front.

INT. OVAL OFFICE - DAY

Kenny opens his door, lets Rusk in.  The President, Bobby and

half of EXCOM look up.  Rusk stands there somber.

And then he breaks into a huge grin.  Everyone cheers him.

An Assistant enters behind Kenny.  Kenny senses him, turns as

the others move to shake hands with Rusk.

INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - DAY

Kenny, grinning, ducks back into his office, closes the door

after the Assistant leaves.  He picks up the phone.

INT. READY ROOM - CECIL FIELD - DAY

Ecker stands at a phone, stares out a window at a replacement

plane being fueled.  A Crusader, not his shot-up one.

INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Kenny thinks fast.  Oh shit.

END INTERCUT

INT. PENTAGON - DAY

SUPER: E-RING.  Then SUPER: THE PENTAGON

Ecker, still in his sweat-drenched flight suit approaches a

security checkpoint.  GUARDS secure his sidearm and user him

through a doorway.  A sign over it reads JCS.

INT. THE TANK - DAY

The door swings open into the Joint Chiefs' SOUND-PROOFED

briefing room known as THE TANK.  LeMay, Taylor and Anderson

sit there around the table.  Ecker salutes.

LeMay rises, prowls over to Ecker.

A long beat.  Sweat runs off Ecker's head.  He can smell

LeMay's breath.

INT. WEST WING HALL - NIGHT

Kenny joins the President and General Taylor in the hallway

as they head for the Oval Office.

Slightly behind them, Kenny looks sidelong at Taylor.

INT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT

FLASHBULBS go off all around the room as the President walks

in, goes over to his desk.  Reporters observe silently, T.V.

cameras track him; Kenny, Bobby and Sorensen watch as the

President sits, takes a pen form his pocket.

Kenny observes in silence as the President SIGNS the

Proclamation of Interdiction.

INT. OVAL OFFICE - LATER

The Oval Office has emptied out.  Only Kenny, Bobby, Sorensen

and the President remain.  The President looks out the

window, Sorensen sits in a chair in front of the desk.  Bobby

and Kenny sit on the edge of the desk.

The President moves over to the GLOBE by his desk, spins it,

stopping in on Europe.

Can we?  The President's fingers turn the globe.  It stops on

North America.  Kenny and Bobby listen.

The President sets the globe gently spinning and walks away.

INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Kenny rubs his eyes, listens to his phone and the WOMAN'S

VOICE at the other end.  It's his wife.

A long silence on the other end of the line.

And to that, there is no answer.  A beat, and it's all Kenny

can promise:

INT. WHITE HOUSE CAFETERIA - NIGHT

Kenny hands Bobby and Bundy cups of coffee.  The three men

nurse them in the silence of the abandoned cafeteria.

Bobby looks at his coffee, then up at Kenny.  He gently

shakes his head.  It's all a sham.

INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - NIGHT

SUPER: WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 24TH.  DAY 9.

Kenny bolts upright from his couch.  He rubs his face, sits

on the edge in the dark for a beat.  He's not going back to

sleep.  He grabs his trousers.

INT. WEST WING HALLS - CONTINUOUS

Kenny makes his way through the dim, deserted halls.

Somewhere in the distance a phone rings.  He reaches a door.

EXT. WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT

Kenny, bundled in an overcoat, steps outside the North

Entrance.  The cool air invigorates him.  He eyes the fence,

Pennsylvania Avenue beyond it, seeming to isolate this world

from the living city beyond.  He starts for the main gate.

EXT. MAIN GATE - CONTINUOUS

A WHITE HOUSE POLICE OFFICER jumps up as Kenny approaches.

Kenny checks his watch.

Kenny considers, shakes his head.  He wants to go home,

but...

Kenny says it with a certain finality.  The Police Officer

nods, and Kenny wanders out through the gates, shouldering

the weight of the world.

EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT

Kenny makes his way down a sidewalk not far from the White

House.  A 24-hour drug store's doors are open.  He pauses.

Inside, a knot of PEOPLE - late-night deliverymen, a cop, the

store employees - talk in undertones at the counter.  Behind

it, a T.V. is signing off with the national anthem.  Sober

voices, sober looks.  Kenny moves on.

EXT. NEWS STAND - NIGHT

A cluster of COLLEGE STUDENTS talk at a news stand.  They're

waiting for the NEWSIE to cut the bands of the next day's

Washington Post, the bundles just being thrown to the

sidewalk from the delivery truck.  Kenny approaches.

In their thing beards, counter-culture clothes, the kids seem

so young, Kenny so old.  Kenny buys a newspaper, its dire

headlines, every story about the crisis.

EXT. CATHOLIC CHURCH - NIGHT

Kenny, newspaper under his arm, continues down the street.

Up ahead, the lights are on in a Catholic Church.  Lines of

CHURCHGOERS are at the door.  Kenny stops, surprised at the

sight this late.  And then he sees the hand-painted banner:

CONFESSIONS 24 HOURS.  PRAY FOR PEACE.

Kenny is moved.  He glances over his shoulder, and then...

joins the line himself.

INT. WHITE HOUSE - SITUATION ROOM - DAY

Kenny's WATCH reads one minute til ten o'clock.  PULL BACK TO

REVEAL:

Kenny, standing just inside the open doors to the White House

Situation Room, a state-of-the-art conference room.  A long,

central table surrounded by leather chairs with phones and

screens built in.  T.V. monitors hang from the ceilings in

the corners.  There are no windows, just oppressive bunker

like walls.  It's far underground.

Across the room the President paces, phone in hand.  Half of

EXCOM is in their seats.  The other half, along with a steady

stream of DUTY OFFICERS, are coming and going.  Kenny steps

aside for a Duty Officer, listens to the President.

Suddenly, McNamara's VOICE fills the room.

INT. FLAG PLOT - THE PENTAGON - DAY

McNamara stands, phone in hand.

THE CAMERA TRACKS AROUND HIM, REVEALING:

A large, elaborate war room, like Mission Control.  Big

screens, plexiglass tracking boards, tiered banks of

communications equipment.  A massive LIGHT TABLE on the floor

at the center of the room projects a map of the Caribbean and

Atlantic.  Arcing across it is a RED LINE: the blockade.

The map is covered with cryptic military notations; WATCH

OFFICERS on a platform which swings out over it update the

latest ship positions.

McNamara's in a booth overlooking the room.  It's open to the

next tier below where Admiral Anderson is giving orders.

INT. SITUATION ROOM - DAY

Kenny and Bobby move to the President's end of the table, sit

down across from each other in mirror-image fashion.  EXCOM

looks to the President.  The second hand of the clock on the

wall wheels past 12.  A hush falls over the room.

INT. FLAG PLOT - DAY

McNamara is mute for a beat.  He turns to view the big room.

He nods to Admiral Anderson, who calls an order down to a

Watch Officer on the floor, and on screens all around the

room, a sector of the map MAGNIFIES the unfolding encounter --

EXT. BRIDGE WING - U.S.S. PIERCE - DAY

-- between the destroyer, U.S.S. Pierce and the SOVIET

FREIGHTERS Gagarin and Kimovsk.  The Pierce's bridge wings

are crammed with helmeted OFFICERS and LOOKOUTS.  They peer

through binoculars at the distant ships, plowing ahead,

straight for them.  The CAPTAIN lowers his binoculars,

determined.

Everyone whirls to the bridge.  The Captain steps forward.

INT. COMBAT INFORMATION CENTER - U.S.S. PIERCE - DAY

The Captain ducks into the CIC.  The CHIEF SONARAN reports.

INT. SITUATION ROOM - DAY

The President reacts.  Kenny and Bobby react.

Consternation.  The President picks up the phone.

All around the room frustration.  Bobby shakes his head.

Kenny sinks back in his chair.  The President hesitates.

INT. FLAG PLOT - DAY

Admiral Anderson nods to a COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER.  The man

makes the connection on a switchboard.

McNamara casts an eye to the map.  The two red MARKERS

labeled Gagarin and Kimovsk are joined by a third: the SUB.

They are ALMOST TOUCHING the blockade line.  On the other

side, the single blue marker for the Pierce.

INT. BRIDGE - U.S.S. PIERCE - DAY

The Captain enters the bridge, takes the phone from the arm

of his chair.

INT. SITUATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The President holds the phone, agonized.

INT. BRIDGE, U.S.S. PIERCE - DAY

INT. SITUATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The President lowers the phone, looks to Bobby and Kenny.

All eyes are on the President.  His eyes are closed tight,

face gray, hand over his mouth.  The time of decision is at

hand.  He lifts the phone once again.

McCone jumps up, leaves the room.  The President looks at

Kenny, tense.  Everyone holds their breath.

The HISS of static on the open line fills the room.  Silence.

EXT. BRIDGE - U.S.S. JOHN R. PIERCE - CONTINUOUS

Lookouts peer across the water at the oncoming Soviet

Freighter.

BINOCULAR POV:

Of the Soviet Bridge, where their LOOKOUTS are staring right

back through their binoculars.

INT. SITUATION ROOM - DAY

The HISS of static.  And then.

INT. FLAG PLOT - THE PENTAGON - CONTINUOUS

McNamara is grinning wildly at the chaos unfolding in the

flag plot below.  Phones are ringing everywhere.

ON THE LIGHT TABLE

The Watch Officers' hands fly from one notation to the other,

circling the Soviet ships, marking them DEAD IN THE WATER.

INT. SITUATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The room EXPLODES, victorious.  Kenny and Bobby break into

big grins, grab each other.  Kenny pumps the President's

hand.  Rusk and Bundy slap each other on the back.

The ruckus goes on for a minute.  McCone comes back in.

His voice is lost in the celebration.  McCone calls out:

The hubub dies away.

The elation goes out of the room.  Kenny looks at the

President.  The President picks up the phone again.

Bobby grips the edge of the table, immediately believing.

The President looks to Bobby.  He has no answer.  Kenny's

mind races over the variables, and he leans forward, intense,

suddenly understanding in a flash of insight:

He glances around the room.  All of EXCOM is looking at him.

Bobby stares at Kenny, too shocked to feel betrayed.

Bobby relaxes.  Around the table there are nods.

The President looks at Kenny.

Bobby's nodding, following the argument.  Kenny looks around

the room for support.

McNamara, pacing on the phone, jumps in.

INT. SITUATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The President holds Kenny's gaze, then lifts the phone.

He hangs up, turns to Kenny.

EXT. SOUTH LAWN - DAY

Kenny, Bobby and the President make their way across the

lawn, out of earshot of the building.

Bobby likes getting under Kenny's skin.  Bobby aims a punch

at his head which Kenny knocks away.  The President changes

gear, serious.

It's a simple suggestion.  The President considers him a

beat, and then McNamara emerges from the White House, heads

for them.  The three friends assume their more reserved,

political faces as he comes up.

Bobby and the President look at Kenny like he's some kind of

Svengali.  Kenny just stands there, poker faced.

INT. WEST WING - DAY

Kenny and McNamara enter the White House from the South Lawn.

They stride down the hall, side by side.

They turn a corner, silence for a beat.

McNamara spares Kenny a short, nasty look.

That gets an amused snort from McNamara, breaking the

tension.

Kenny stares him in the eye, serious, hushed.  A friend.

McNamara enters the elevator.  He turns, stands there facing

Kenny for a dramatic beat.  Then the doors close.

INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - DAY

WALTER CRONKITE, on the B&W T.V. screen, sits in front of a

map showing Cuba and the blockade line.

PULL BACK, REVEALING:

Kenny watching the T.V., is yelling at the phone.

He hangs up, hears SHOUTING from the Oval Office.  He goes to

the door, enters --

INT. OVAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

-- and sees the President leaning over his desk, jabbing his

finger at General Taylor.

Kenny realizes he's not joking as he spots Bobby sitting on

the couch behind Taylor, pale as a ghost.  Taylor, embattled,

wants to die, but stands there like a man.

INT. MISSILE SILO - DAY

CLOSE ON

The nose cone of a TITAN MISSILE, its 20 megaton nuclear

warhead wrapped in the steel re-entry shell.  Cold, silent,

fearsome.

INT. OVAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Taylor continues on.

The President punches his desk.

But Taylor knows this very well.  And the way he's suffering,

it's clear he's taking the heat for his underlings.  From

over on the couch Bobby chimes in:

The President glances at Kenny who stands there, speechless.

The General leaves.  Kenny closes the door, wanders deeper

into the office.  He looks from the President to Bobby.

There's a long, long beat of shocked silence.

Bobby is disgusted, but knows they're right.

The President collapses in his rocking chair.  Kenny leans

over the back of the sofa next to Bobby.

Bobby looks at the President, meaningful.  The President

turns to Kenny.

EXT. WEST WING DRIVEWAY - DAY

SUPER: THURSDAY, OCTOBER 25TH.  DAY 10.

The West Wing looms behind Kenny and Bundy.  Kenny, poker

faced, takes a drag on his cigarette.  Bundy nervously flicks

his, looks away from Kenny a beat.

Bundy turns back to him.

Kenny grinds his jaw, but doesn't say anything.  He agrees.

Bundy steps up to him, confiding.

Kenny prickles, intense, but Bundy presses on, too wrapped up

in his own thinking to notice.

Kenny gets in his face, intimidating.

INT. PRESIDENT'S BEDROOM - DAY

Kenny throws himself on a chair in the bedroom's sitting

area, newspaper in hand.  The President, buttoning his shirt

in a full-length mirror, sees him.  There's a TV on.  The

President selects a tie from a nearby rack, eyes the paper.

The President's eyes flick over to him in the mirror.

The President turns around, heads over to the T.V.  Kenny

folds his arms, disgusted.

ON THE T.V.

Live coverage of the United Nations Security Council

meetings.  Holding forth in Russian is VALERIAN ZORIN, 50s,

tough, likeable, the Soviet Ambassador to the U.N. and

chairman of the Security Council.  A translator relays the

meaning.

RESUME

The President's jaw tightens.  He turns to Kenny.

INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - DAY

Kenny, phone to his ear, suffers as Bobby harangues him.

Kenny throws the Lippman article at him.

Silence.  Terrible silence.  That paralyzes Bobby.  Kenny

stares at him.  He means it, but regrets it, too.

But Bobby gets it.  Kenny shifts gears, lets it go.

INT. U.S. OFFICES - U.N. - DAY

The U.S. suite is in frantic preparation, STAFFERS coming and

going.  Stevenson takes his phone from a SECRETARY.

INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Kenny turns to gaze at his little T.V. in the credenza, U.N.

coverage continuing, as if he could see Adlai there.

INT. U.S. OFFICES - U.N. - CONTINUOUS

Adlai is packing up his briefcase.

INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Kenny rises from his chair, paces toward the T.V.  He pauses.

INT. U.S. OFFICES - U.N. - CONTINUOUS

Adlai looks around to his own T.V., showing the session going

on downstairs.  Zorin, ON CAMERA, dominates the council:

alternately bold, aggressive, and then reasonable.  Even in

Russian, with the lagging translation, he's formidable.

INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Kenny is watching exactly the same performance.  Zorin is

masterful.  Kenny knows it.  And when he talks to Adlai, it's

with the fatalism of a coach knowing he's putting his third

string quarterback in against the all-Pro linebacker.

INT. U.S. OFFICES - U.N. - CONTINUOUS

Adlai watches his Staffers leave his inner office.  He hears

Kenny, and everything Kenny is saying.

Adlai lowers the phone to its cradle.  An ANXIOUS STAFFER

sticks his head in the door, a concerned, questioning look on

his face.

Adlai adjusts his tie.  HIS HAND IS SHAKING.  He notices it,

and manages a brave smile.

INT. HALL, U.N. - CONTINUOUS

Adlai, briefcase in hand, marches down the hall at the hand

of his team: Staffers and Photo Interpreters with large

leather portfolio bags.  The big double doors to the council

chamber loom, and he gestures to the Photo Interpreters.

And then a DOORMAN throws open the door for him.

INT. U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS

Adlai enters.  He is instantly dwarfed by the enormous room.

Lights, T.V. cameras, the imposing circular arrangement of

delegation tables.  And the entire world is watching.

Adlai pauses.  Then as the first SECURITY COUNCIL MEMBERS

begin to notice him, he heads for the vacant seats for the

American delegation.  The ROMANIAN DELEGATE saws the air.

But as the Romanian wheezes on, all eyes are on Adlai.  Adlai

takes his seat, his Staffers behind him.  They pass him up

papers, and he spreads them before him, taking no notice that

the entire room is staring at him.

Adlai finally glances up.  Across the circle sits Zorin, in

the flesh, at the head of his own tough-looking DELEGATION.

He acknowledges Adlai with a superior smile.

The Romanian Delegate leans back from his microphone.  Zorin

leans forward, begins in Russian, and the Translator's voice

catches up with him.  His tone, body language, composure are

all that of complete confidence.

Adlai nods, returns to his notes, as Zorin continues.

The audience laughs.  Zorin basks in it.  And then grows

stern.

INT. SITUATION ROOM - WHITE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

EXCOM watches the coverage on the situation room's T.V.'s.

The President and Bobby sit side by side, Kenny just behind

them.  Bobby checks his watch, looks at the President.

Bobby looks back at Kenny.

INT. U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS

Zorin stares at Adlai.  Adlai studiously ignores him, works

on his own papers.

Zorin leans back in his chair.  Adlai finally looks up.  He

meets Zorin's icy bravura.  He notes the cameras around the

room.  This is the grandest stage of all.

And in that moment, Adlai becomes the spokesman for America.

Adlai's tone is definitive.  A tremor of interest passes

through the various delegations.

INT. SITUATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

EXCOM is transfixed by the continuing debate.

They all crowd the T.V. as if it were a title fight.  Except

for Bobby.  Kenny glances over at him.  He has the phone

pinned between his ear and shoulder.  Kenny looks back to the

T.V.

INT. U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS

Adlai fixes Zorin in his seat, his voice rising.

Zorin, headphones on, listens to his own translation, but

doesn't respond, acts bored.  It gets Adlai's goat, and he

begins to lose his cool.  A rumble from the U.N.  The CAMERA

FINDS Adlai's hand SHAKING, gripping his pen.

INT. SITUATION ROOM - WHITE HOUSE - DAY

EXCOM is worried.

INT. U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS

But Adlai's tremors are not tremors of fear.  They are

tremors of anger.  His voice goes hard and cold.

The diplomatic world GASPS as Adlai drops all pretense of

civility, all statesman-like grace.

INT. SITUATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

EXCOM's excitement mounts.  In the chorus urging Adlai on, we

find Kenny edge toward the screen.

INT. U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS

Zorin shoots Adlai a testy look.

There's laughter at Zorin's refusal to be bullied: but it's

nervous laughter, not the polite stuff of diplomatic tete-a

tete.  The RUMBLE in the room grows louder.

EXCOM ROARS!  Fists in the air!  Bobby lets the phone dangle

a beat, covers it.  And then he lifts it again.

He lowers the phone to the receiver.  Kenny shoots him a

triumphant smile.  The President looks at Kenny, shakes his

head, a big smile on his face.

INT. U.N. SECURITY COUNCIL CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS

Adlai presses on.

And Zorin cracks.  He looks uneasily to his delegation.  They

bend forward to consult.  Adlai sits back in his chair,

draping his arms over its wings with the confidence of

someone who knows he's kicked ass.

Adlai looks around the room while he's waiting for his

answer, managing not to smile.  The diplomatic world is

scandalized.  At last Zorin regroups, lifts his head from his

huddle.

The CHILEAN DELEGATE stands.

The room explodes in laughter.  Not just nervous any more,

not just polite.  They're laughing at Zorin's parliamentary

ploy blowing up in his face.

Zorin's smile is gone, his smooth facade destroyed.  And he

looks like the biggest fool in the world.

Adlai stares at the beet-faced man with disdain.  At last,

Adlai stands, gestures to the door to the hall behind him.

The PHOTO INTERPRETERS come racing in with their briefing

boards.

The Delegates RUMBLE in interest, rise from their seats to

approach Adlai.

INT. SITUATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

EXCOM celebrates.  Phones ring at several of the chairs at

the conference table. The President and Kenny meet as Bundy

picks up a phone in the b.g.

Bundy steps forward, holding the phone.

Kenny and the President turn to see what they already have

heard in those two words: concern.  The room falls quiet.

INT. FLAG PLOT - THE PENTAGON - CONTINUOUS

Phone in hand, McNamara paces at his post over the flag plot.

EXT. OCEAN, PUERTO RICO TRENCH - CONTINUOUS

The Soviet Tanker, Groznyy, breasts the heavy seas.  Armed

CREWMEN race along the deck to makeshift sandbagged

emplacements in the bow.

The CAMERA PANS to the left, revealing a U.S. DESTROYER

racing up alongside a few hundred yards away, pounding up and

over the swells, punching up a huge fan of spray from its

bow.

INT. FLAG PLOT - THE PENTAGON - CONTINUOUS

Admiral Anderson, on the phone on the level below, is tense.

McNamara leans against the wall, closes his eyes in

exhaustion and stress.  And when he opens the, we PAN AROUND

TO REVEAL:

A G-d-like view of the flag plot, covered with HUNDREDS OF

SHIPS, PLANES AND MARKINGS.

McNamara stares out at the bewildering tangle of symbols,

living men behind each one.  Each tangle of red and blue

symbols a powderkeg.  A G-dlike view indeed.  And it is far

more than any one mere man could keep control of. And he

begins to realize it.

And not only that, in his bleary, sleep-deprived fog, he

begins to understand something happening down there.

The CAMERA MOVES over the enormous map, over the scrolling

cryptic numerology.  THE BUZZ of radio communications bleeds

in from the background.  The overhead platform swivels on its

motor, like the vast arm of some fate-writing god as the

Watch Officer on it updates the movements of the ships.

McNamara stares, at the verge of grasping something.  Through

the door-crack of genius, he has the glimpse of some grander

thing, some grander design.

That starts McNamara from his fatigued reverie.  He goes to

the railing, looks down on Anderson.

Anderson turns, gazes up from his tier below, distracted.

Anderson holds the phone aside, turns around again, looks up

at him, impatient.  His answer is hard, cold, dangerous.

Anderson listens again to the phone.

EXT. OCEAN, PUERTO RICO TRENCH - CONTINUOUS

The Destroyer's forward 5-inch twin guns swivel, train on the

Groznyy.  A beat.  They OPEN FIRE with an ear-splitting

BAMBAM, ripping the air in front of the muzzles, the Groznyy

so close a miss isn't possible.

INT. FLAG PLOT - THE PENTAGON - CONTINUOUS

McNamara SHOUTS at Anderson, dropping down the steps to

Anderson's level.

Watch Officers scramble to comply, chaos and shouting in the

war room as a chorus if "Cease fire cease fire cease fire,"

goes up.  McNamara turns on Anderson, is in his face.

Anderson smashes the phone down, wheels on McNamara, furious.

EXT. OCEAN, PUERTO RICO TRENCH - CONTINUOUS

The Destroyer's guns hammer away at the Groznyy, at point

blank range... but the Groznyy IS UNHARMED.

Suddenly, in the air above it appear BRILLIANT FLARES.  They

light up the ship, brighter than the sun.  The destroyer

isn't firing deadly rounds... it's firing harmless

starshells.

INT. FLAG PLOT - THE PENTAGON - CONTINUOUS

Anderson gets in McNamara's face.

Everyone's eyes are on the two men.  Only the chatter of

teletype breaks the paralyzing silence.  McNamara blinks,

looks down at the plot on the floor.  Anderson's voice drops

to a deadly sotto.

McNamara looks away at the faces of the men in the room.

McNamara turns back.  And all trepidation, embarrassment,

hesitation are gone.  He coldly appraises Anderson.

He passes his hand over the enormous plot below.

McNamara, trembling with anger, awe, whirls to Anderson.  And

his burgeoning insight is born - clear, hard and cold.

McNamara JABS HIS FINGER OUT AT the plot, and --

-- the CAMERA RACES DOWN, TRACKING OVER IT, across the vast

ebb and flow of information, the delicate ballet of symbols

and numerology, this language of steel and human life.

INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - DAY

SUPER: FRIDAY, OCTOBER 26TH.  DAY 11.

On Kenny's T.V. Walter Cronkite reads the news to footage of

a BOARDING PARTY going up a ladder to the freighter MARCULA.

The Boarding Party wears dress whites and is UNARMED.

Kenny, who turns from the T.V. as the door to his office

opens.  Rusk walks in.

Kenny reacts to Rusk's enigmatic expression.  And out from

behind Rusk steps JOHN SCALI, the ABC News Correspondent.

INT. OVAL OFFICE - DAY

OFF THEIR REACTIONS, the CAMERA FINDS an under-strength, ad

hoc EXCOM - Kenny, Bobby, Taylor, Bundy, Sorensen, McCone,

Ball and the President.  Guarded hope all around.  The short,

balding, pugnacious Scali looks discomfited.

Kenny paces behind the gathered men around the President's

desk, listening, mind going a million miles an hour.

Kenny eyes Bundy, makes him uncomfortable.  The President

sizes Scali up.

Nobody dares speak.  It's as if the possibility of a

settlement will vanish into thin air if anyone moves.

The gathered men chuckle, only Scali a bit dour but being a

good sport about it.  Scali checks his watch.

He moves away from his desk.  The men watch him.

Scali nods.  Rusk escorts him out.  They wait until the door

closes.  Taylor looks over at McCone who nods.

Kenny gives Bobby a hard look.  The President appears

unfazed.

The President considers Taylor, then looks over to Kenny.

INT. FBI, COUNTER-INTELLIGENCE DEPARTMENT FILES - NIGHT

BANG!  A STACK OF FILES slams down beside Kenny on a large

paper-covered conference table.  WALTER SHERIDAN, Kenny's

investigator-buddy, wears a visitor's pass just like Kenny.

Kenny and Walter RIFLE through the folders, super fast, super

proficient.  A half-dozen FBI AGENTS work around the table.

Kenny stands, runs his hands through his hair, aggravated.

Kenny whirls on Sheridan.  A frozen beat.

Walter pushes a typed dateline of Khruschev's major career

moves, and one of the Agents hands Kenny a list of Fomin's

postings.  He lays them side by side.  And for every step of

Khruschev's, there's a step for Fomin.  Not only that, but

the DATES ARE IDENTICAL or nearly so.

Kenny's face falls.  But a YOUNG FBI AGENT cuts in.

The Young FBI Agent proffers him a file.  Kenny snatches it.

Kenny looks up at Walter.  Walter nods sagely, lights a pipe.

A PHONE on the table SHRILLS, shattering the silent triumph.

INT. STATLER HOTEL COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT

A few lonely BUSINESS TRAVELERS hang out in the dim coffee

shop.  Faint music plays.  Scali and ALEXANDER FOMIN sit with

steaming cups of coffee.  Scali, nervous, unfolds a note.

Fomin, an expressionless gray spectre of a man, eyes him.  He

is, in his boredom, a spy's spy.

Scali demurs.  He has no instructions on this count.

Scali takes a sip of coffee.  Fomin stares at him, intense.

INT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT

Scali finishes debriefing the President, Bobby, Kenny,

McCone, Taylor and Bundy.

Kenny and Bobby share a hopeful glance.  Rusk enters from

Kenny's office.  And he's unable to contain his excitement.

INT. COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE - STATE DEPARTMENT - NIGHT

From a cluster of folding metal chairs, Kenny, Bobby, Rusk

and Sorensen watch a TELETYPE hammer out the message as it

comes off the wire.  It's painfully slow, like watching a bad

typist type a manuscript.  Ten pages of this is an eternity.

To top it off, it's in Russian.  A TRANSLATOR reads it off,

word by word to a TRANSCRIBER.

INT. CABINET ROOM - NIGHT

Kenny slams a page of Khruschev's letter on the table.  He

jabs his finger at it.  EXCOM listens, intent.

The President turns to McCone.

EXCOM chuckles.

The President eyes the EXCOM members one by one, an incipient

smile on his face.

There are mostly nods of assent, big smiles around the table.

Except from  McCone and Taylor.  The President takes his copy

of the letter, flips through it.  He shakes his head, almost

unable to believe that Khruschev has given in.  A long beat.

EXT. O'DONNELL DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

A long, black car stops at the end of Kenny's driveway.  The

door opens, and Kenny steps out.  He says an inaudible

goodnight to the driver, and the car pulls off.  He turns,

facing the white two-story house with the neat front yard,

the lights out.  And he smiles.  Home at last.

EXT. O'DONNELL PATIO - NIGHT

A screen door squeaks open.  Kenny steps out into the

darkness of the back yard.  And there, in her robe, sitting

startled on a lawn chair, lit only by the dim glow of the

kitchen window, is Helen.  Kenny stands there tired, his coat

slung over his shoulder.

Helen rises, her own care-worn face turned to his.  For a

silent moment they gaze at each other, searching in the lines

of each others' face for the changes of a long separation.

They see them.  But they've been married a long time, and the

awkwardness passes.

Kenny drops his coat on a table as Helen comes up and folds

herself into his arms.

They kiss, comfortable.  But not too long, and he lets her

go.  She looks at him again, sees he's suppressing a smile.

INT. HALL OUTSIDE KENNY'S OFFICE - DAY

SUPER: SATURDAY, OCTOBER 27TH.  DAY 12.

Kenny, in his overcoat, steps aside as a pair of Duty

Officers race past him, almost bowling him over.

He slows as he nears the doors to his office and the Oval

Office, DISCOVERING:

TOTAL CHAOS.  EXCOM guys, Assistants, dart to and from the

offices and halls.  On all their faces grim expressions.

Kenny stands there a beat in confusion.  And then Bobby

swings out of Kenny's office.  There's a desperate edge to

Bobby's voice.

Kenny and Bobby walk fast for the cabinet room, Kenny still

in his coat.

Kenny is stunned.

Kenny gives Bobby a sharp look as they enter --

INT. CABINET ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The President, in shirtsleeves, no tie, glances up at Kenny

as he and Bobby enter.  Kenny can only bear his look for a

second: he blew the call on Fomin.  But the President is

clearly relieved to see him, gives him a faint smile.

Half of EXCOM, including McNamara, McCone, Rusk, and Taylor

barely notice them as they're already there arguing.

Kenny sits down hurriedly, shucks off his coat as he joins

the conversation in mid-stream.

Bobby gives him a look: told you things got worse.

Bitter silence.  They all look to the President.  Imminent

victory has turned to ashes.  The President studies his own

folded hands.  Ball and Thompson enter, take seats.  One by

one, throughout the scene, other EXCOM members join the

group.

Kenny shakes his head in mute anger.  McNamara and Rusk seem

to sense the President's feelings, too.

Kenny looks the President in the eye.

The President sighs in the face of the stern advice.  He

nods, expecting as much.  Bobby still can't look at anyone.

Everyone of Kenny's instincts jumps.  His head snaps up to

listen to Taylor.  Taylor pauses.

Kenny hears the fatalism in McNamara's voice.  A long beat.

Everyone stares at McNamara.

They were so close last night... and suddenly Lundahl and

LeMay enter the room with the day's briefing boards.

Lundahl stands there at the end of the table, gray.  He

almost can't say it, can't look the President in the face.

EXT. MISSILE SITE - CUBA - CONTINUOUS

The missiles site is now more than just dirt and clearing

equipment.  It's an armed camp, with missiles, fuel trailers,

erectors spaced every few hundred yards.  MISSILE TECHNICIANS

service the towering SS-4s.

With a barrage of shouted orders in Russian, and a whine of

the ERECTOR's engines, THE MISSILE BEGINS TO RISE.

It stops, vertical.

INT. CABINET ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The news hits the room like a thunderbolt.  Kenny looks to

Bobby and the President.  The blood is gone from their faces.

A pall falls over the room as LeMay explains.

They all look to the President.  Kenny stares, in a private

hell, blacker and more complete than anyone should ever know.

In that shocked silence each man grapples with failure.  The

Best and the Brightest could not prevent what must come next.

The President gives Kenny a meaningful look.

Taylor exits.  Kenny rises, gives the President an almost

imperceptible nod, as he prepares to leave in Taylor's wake.

INT. READY ROOM - MACDILL AFB - DAY

MAJOR RUDOLPH ANDERSON, 30, wearing the bulky high-altitude

pressure suit of a U-2 pilot, takes the phone from one of the

Air Force NCOs who are helping him suit up.

INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Kenny, at the other end of the line, stares out the window at

the fall day.  It seems so mild, so unlike war.  And it takes

him a beat before he realizes Anderson's on the line.

Kenny takes a breath, ready to start the shuck-and-jive...

but for some reason doesn't.

INT. READY ROOM - MACDILL AFB - CONTINUOUS

Now mostly suited up, Major Anderson takes the phone out of

the NCO's hand.  He nods, serious.

INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

INT. READY ROOM - MACDILL AFB - CONTINUOUS

Major Anderson waves his NCOs away.  They leave the room.

The Major sits on a bench in front of his locker, thinks.

The young Major smiles to himself, to the phone.

INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Kenny nods to himself, deeply touched by the man's faith.

INT. READY ROOM - MACDILL AFB - CONTINUOUS

With a click, the line goes dead and Anderson walks the phone

over to the receiver on the wall.

END INTERCUT

EXT. RUNWAY - MACDILL AFB - MOMENTS LATER

A cart speeds down the tarmac, an NCO behind the wheel.

Beside him sits Major Anderson, his helmet on, visor up.  He

adjusts the mix on the oxygen bottle he's carrying at his

feet, breathing in preparation for the high-altitude flight.

Up ahead, among a host of service vehicles, sits the U-2.

INT. U-2 - DAY

Anderson switches over to the U-2's oxygen supply as his NCOs

belt him in.  They slap him on the helmet for good luck and

lower the canopy as he brings his engines up to power.

And he throws the throttle forward,

EXT. STRATOSPHERE - MOMENTS LATER

The twilight, in-between, world of the stratosphere.  Far

below -- clouds, shining blue day.  Above, stars and the

indigo depths of space.  We hang in utter silence.

A silver glint appears in the center of the horizon.  It

grows larger.  Then larger still.  It is the U-2.  We barely

have time to register the rising hiss of its engines, when it

FILLS THE SCREEN and BOOMS PAST, leaving us standing still.

The CAMERA PANS to follow it, but it's already dwindled to a

speck, and we feel how fast 600 miles an hour really is.

INT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS

Anderson's gloved hand reaches for the CAMERA HEATER

switches.

EXT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS

The belly door whines open like a silver eyelid, exposing the

camera's lense.

INT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS

Anderson double checks his position, switches to the

autopilot for the stability only the machine can provide,

then hits the CAMERA ACTIVATE button on his joystick.

BAMABMABMABMA... The camera begins its photography.

Anderson watches the number on the film-remaining counter

spool down.  He stares out the window.  The towering clouds

below rise up magnificent, glorious... a glimpse of heaven.

Rapt,  Anderson stares.  And then suddenly a BLARING ALARM

GOES OFF IN THE COCKPIT.  It shocks Anderson around to the

controls.  It's his MISSILE WARNING LIGHT.

Anderson' hands flash out to the joystick, turning off the

cameras, disabling autopilot.  He banks the U-2 hard.

EXT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS

As the U-2 turns, far, far below, emerging from the clouds,

barely visible, rises a CONTRAIL.  It arcs lazily toward us.

A beat, and then another CONTRAIL.

Then ANOTHER.  The anti-aircraft missiles creating them are

too small to be seen with the naked eye.

INT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS

The cockpit is a cacophony of alarms and lights, the horizon

outside tilted.  Anderson's breath comes fast, rasping as he

does his strains going into the high-g turn.

He looks out the cockpit window, finds the first SA-2 missile

in pursuit only several thousand feet below him now.  He

waits. Waits.  Waits, still in the turn.  The black head of

the missile now visible.

He puts the plane over, rolling out into an opposite bank.

EXT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS

The spy plane's long flimsy wings weren't made for

dogfighting.  They BEND terribly in the rollout.  And then

the first missile STREAKS past, tries to correct its miss,

but can't and vanishes into the distance at a 90-degree

angle.

INT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS

Anderson's breath comes faster and faster as the second

missile rises up, now visible.  He puts the throttle as far

as it goes, trying to outrun death.  Every second is a tenth

of a mile, and every mile shortens the missile's life span.

The rising missile drafts aft, closing on the U-2 from

behind.

EXT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS

The second missile's contrail rises up behind the plane,

levels off, and closes on it at a tremendous rate.

The third missile rises up in the far distance behind the

second.

The second missile races up on the U-2, closer, right behind

it, can't miss.  Then at a hundred yards, the contrail

suddenly peters out, and the missile, out of fuel, drops

away.

But the third missile closes.

INT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS

Anderson glances out the window, sees the spent missiles fall

away, and spots the third missile still seeking him aft.

Hand pinning the throttle forward, he prays under his breath.

EXT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS

The third SA-2 rides its billowing column of exhaust straight

for the tail of the U-2.  This one is not out of fuel.

INT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS

Major Anderson opens his eyes.  He stares out the window at

the glorious wonder of cloud and sea and earth below.

EXT. U-2 - CONTINUOUS

And the missile looms.  We have time to realize it's almost

as big as the plane itself before it SHEARS right into the U

2's tail and EXPLODES in a BLINDING FLASH.

INT. HALL OUTSIDE BUNDY'S OFFICE - DAY

Kenny, jogging down the hall, hears form an open door.

Kenny goes over to the threshold.  Inside the office Bundy

stands up from behind his desk, grave.  And Kenny knows.

INT. CABINET ROOM - DAY

All of EXCOM is there except for Bundy.  Kenny sits behind

the President, deeply distraught over Major Anderson.

In the silence, Kenny reads the faces around the room.

They're convinced by McCone's pronouncement.  Kenny's not.

McCone gives him a get-serious look.  But Kenny presses on.

Bundy enters the room.  Everyone looks up.  He stands there

in the doorway, his face tight.

Kenny sags in his chair.  Bundy, of course, has more bad

news, and they all know it.  A hopeless beat.  The President

just stares at Bundy, unable to ask.  Bundy nods, affirming

what everyone is thinking.

The humor falls on a cold audience.

And finally the moment Kenny has dreaded all this time has

come to pass.  He looks at Bobby, then at the President.  The

President stares at the cup of coffee in his hands, as if

trying to read the Fates' design in it.  A long beat, and

everyone holds their breath.

LeMay clears his throat.  Everyone looks at him, expecting

him to scream or jump up and down.

But he says it without any belief in the words, realizing

they're being tied fast to the train tracks of war.

INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - DAY

Alone in his office, shattered, Kenny stares out the window,

viewing the distant Ellipse through a gap in the trees.  Kids

are out there playing football.  He glances at his watch, and

grabs his jacket.

EXT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY

Kenny puts on his jacket as he goes down the steps into the

bright autumn day, walking away from the White House.  It

drops behind him -- his step is faster, more urgent.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Kenny walks down the sidewalk, drawn toward the Ellipse.  The

sixth grade FOOTBALL PLAYERS sweep forward with a running

play.  Kenny scans them, searching, his breath coming hard.

EXT. ELLIPSE - DAY

He reaches the edge of the open field.  And then he spots the

name on the jersey: O'Donnell.  It's Kevin. The players

relinquish the ball and the offense comes off the field.

Kevin sees his dad.

Kenny manages a smile as Kevin trots over.  Kevin pulls his

helmet off.  They stand there a long beat, Kenny desperate to

take him up, abandon his post... but he doesn't.

But Kevin sees the turmoil in his father's face.

Kenny's forced smile is answer enough.

But Kevin knows.  Together they know.  The end of the world

is at hand.

Suddenly a car HONKS.  Kenny turns around.  Bobby is leaning

out the rear passenger window of his limo.  And he sees what

Kenny is doing.  He doesn't want to cut in, but has to.

Kenny looks back at his son.

Kevin puts his helmet back on his head.  Kenny watches as

Kevin jogs off to rejoin his team.  Kenny turns his back on

his son, and strides for Bobby's limo, dying inside.

EXT. SANS SOUCI PARKING LOT - DAY

Kenny and Bobby stand by their car off to one side of the

restaurant's parking lot.  Bobby's Secret Service Agents

maintain a discreet distance.

Bobby jams the last bit of sandwich in his mouth.  A beat.

Kenny looks him in the eye.

Bobby is speechless with rage.

Bobby's beyond furious.  They catch their rising voices.

Bobby simmers for a long beat, thinking.  And boy, does this

guy hate admitting he's wrong.

Kenny stares off at the city, agonized.

INT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT

Kenny enters from his office, finding Bobby, Rusk and

Sorensen talking with the President.  The President gives him

a brief, meaningful look.

As Rusk talks, Kenny passes close by Bobby.  Bobby whispers:

That strikes a cord with Kenny.

And Kenny looks at Bobby.  The world stops.

It hits Bobby like a lightning bolt.

The President, Rusk and Sorensen stare at him, mute.

HOLD ON the exact same mute reaction from the entire

assembled EXCOM.  Finally McCone breaks the spell.

Bobby, Kenny and Sorensen start to object, but McCone raises

his voice over theirs.

McNamara shakes his head, intrigued but skeptical.

Kenny, Bobby and Sorensen look at McNamara, grateful.

The President leans forward.  Sensing he's about to speak,

all eyes turn to him.

Most EXCOM is nodding, agreeing.  McCone shakes his head in

disgust.  Taylor sits in silence.

It's a terrible responsibility to bear.  The room is silent.

At last Bobby looks up from his folded hands to his brother.

The President stares back.  There is nobody else who can do

this.  Only Bobby. His brother.

Bobby nods, taking up the gauntlet.

Sorensen and Bobby rise as one, head for the doors.

Bobby and Kenny exchange a look.

EXT. WEST WING DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

A LONG SHOT: Bobby emerges from the West Wing in his

overcoat, briefcase in hand.  He pauses, tiny, alone.  The

West Wing - and all its imposing spotlit power behind him -

reduced to this insignificant man on his eleventh-hour

mission.

And then, out of the shadows, in the f.g., steps Kenny in his

own coat, his breath frosting in the late-night air.  Bobby

sees him, and knows he is not so alone anymore.

ON THE DRIVEWAY

They meet in front of the limo.  Bobby stops, shuffles his

things, awkward.

Kenny opens the driver's side door.  The Secret Service LIMO

DRIVER peers out.

Kenny's nod and look -- there's no arguing.  The Limo Driver

hops out, and Kenny gets in.  Bobby stands there outside for

a beat.  He tries to hide how touched he is, but can't

completely.

INT. BOBBY'S LIMO - NIGHT

Bobby recovers, opens his own door, gets in the front seat

next to Kenny.

Kenny starts up the engine.  Bobby smiles a twisted smile.

As the car pulls away, the two men sit in silence, neither

willing to admit how glad the other is there.

EXT. PENNSYLVANIA AVE. - NIGHT

The limo wheels out into the street, carrying the two friends

into the darkness.

INT. BOBBY'S LIMO - NIGHT

Bobby stares out the window at the passing city, the lights

the lives behind those windows.  As the car drives on and on,

the tension returns.  Bobby feels the weight of all those

lives.  On him.  A long beat.  He gazes at Kenny, the only

man he could ever admit this to:

Kenny glances over at him.  Bobby stares back.

Bobby looks at him.

Kenny means it.  He looks away.  Bobby shifts, awkward.

Kenny looks him.  This isn't the way to the Justice

Department.  But he complies.

And Bobby, in the silence and closeness of the car, turns on

Kenny - anguished, knowing his life is at its climax.

Kenny looks to him, moved, not knowing what to say.

He looks to Kenny, searching his face, then away,

embarrassed.

That breaks the tension as they arrive at the scene:

THROUGH THE WINDOW

Appears the grim, square lines of the SOVIET EMBASSY.  Police

cars line the streets outside it.  All the windows are dark.

A cordon of KGB GUARDS in plainclothes stand by the gated

entrance.  On the opposite side of the street lounge two

dozen WASHINGTON D.C. POLICE.

RESUME

Kenny gives Bobby a look.  Bobby rolls down his window.

The final duty of an embassy before war...

EXT. SOVIET EMBASSY - NIGHT

THE CAMERA lifts away from the limo, turning toward the

Embassy, past the Guards, past the brass plate which reads

EMBASSY OF THE UNITED SOVIET SOCIALIST REPUBLICS, up and up

to the roof where black, reeking SMOKE billows from all of

the Embassy's several chimneys.

The CAMERA races into it.  It engulfs us all.

EXT. JUSTICE DEPARTMENT - NIGHT

Kenny squeals the limo up to the curb in front of the Justice

Department.  The doors fly open, and Kenny and Bobby jump

out, head up the steps to the building.

INT. HALL OUTSIDE BOBBY'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Bobby's STAFFERS greet them as they stride down the hall,

Staffer #1 taking Bobby's coat.

They reach the double oak doors to Bobby's suite and stop.

Bobby faces Kenny.

And before Kenny's eyes, all of Bobby's doubt vanishes.  In

its place, a severe confidence.  A grandeur Kenny has never

seen.

It makes Kenny pause.  He beholds his best friend become a

man of the ages.  And then Bobby SMOOTHLY opens the door.

INT. BOBBY'S WAITING ROOM - NIGHT

And a DOOR SHUTS OC like a threshold of history.  HOLD ON

Bobby's waiting room.  Silent.  Cavernous.  Dim.  Plush

carpet.  Heavy drapes framing dark windows.  And abandoned

secretary's desk.  A row of sofas and chairs on either side

of the room.  Two doorways, one at either end of the room.

A WOMAN sits in one of the chairs for visitors.  Dressed in

gray.  Prim.  But beautiful.  A secretary of some sort.

One of the double doors to the hall swings silently open.

Kenny glides in.  He sees the other door shut at the far end

of the room.  Kenny crashes in one of the chairs to wait.

HOLD ON THE SCENE, motionless, silent.

Kenny WHISTLES two notes.  Stops.  And then he begins to

WHISTLE the Irish tune, O'Donnell Aboo.  He gets a bar into

it -- and there's a polite, soft COUGH.

Kenny stops.  Then notices the Woman in gray across the room.

He didn't see her.  It's dim over there.  She looks at him,

expressionless.

The CAMERA FINDS: a pin on her lapel.  A RED HAMMER AND

SICKLE.

Kenny reacts.  Dobrynin's assistant?  His opposite number?  A

friend?  Or more than a friend?

Here is the face of the enemy.  Not a smile between them.

Kenny resumes his ease.  And begins to WHISTLE again.

The haunting Irish song echoes in the vaulted ceiling,

filling the dim room.  Strange, sad, beautiful.  The woman

listens.  And her face begins to soften.

Kenny stares at the dark, lonely windows, his SONG striving

to fill the empty room.

Kenny sinks deeper in the chair, his tune all-consuming...

and the Woman's voice breaks in.  Kenny stops, looks over.

Her voice is tremulous and beautiful.  Just a snatch of some

song in Russian.  She stops, awkward.

Kenny stares.  The Woman stares back.  No smiles.  But in

their eyes, they each see the other's fear, the other's

beauty, the other's humanity.

So this is the enemy.

Kenny glances to the door.  He considers for a long moment.

Kenny breaks the gaze.  He begins to whistle again.  The

CAMERA drifts away, finding the far DOOR to the inner office,

Kenny's tune stronger, carrying with it hope...

INT. BOBBY'S OFFICE - NIGHT

... to the other side of that DOOR.  Dobrynin sits in a chair

opposite Bobby behind his desk.  The room is equally dim.

And far more tense.

Silence.  And then the FAINTEST STRAIN of O'Donnell Aboo.

Dobrynin glances briefly over his shoulder at the door.

But Bobby, unseen by Dobrynin, can't help the flicker of a

private smile.  It's Kenny's presence, and Bobby is the

stronger for it.  And then the tune is gone.

Bobby leans forward, cool, controlled, masterful.

EXT. MISSILE SITE - CUBA - CONTINUOUS

Floodlights illuminate MISSILES, vertical on their erectors,

support VEHICLES, clustered across the man-made clearing.

Mask-wearing Technicians wave a FUEL TRUCK back to the

nearest missile.  Clouds of toxic VAPOR rise from the others.

They've already been fueled.

INT. BOBBY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Dobrynin listens impassively, as is his professional duty.

Dobrynin looks out the window.  And then, pained, looks back

at Bobby.

Bobby acknowledges him with a nod.

Dobrynin stares at Bobby.  Stares hard.

The two men move their argument forward with the deliberation

and formality of chess masters.

Dobrynin reels internally.  The only sign on his face is a

slight tremor.  Bobby looks up, registers the calculated

effect.  And to Dobrynin's horror, the Russian believes:

But not so fast.  Bobby folds his hands.  And he smoothly

goes from hard-ass brinksman to sensitive deal-maker.

Dobrynin holds his breath.

Dobrynin lets out his breath.

Dobrynin grasps the move immediately, understanding the

ramifications.  Still he hesitates a moment.

Meaning this is the bone he can show the hard line.  Dobrynin

struggles internally, knowing what Bobby has done, wanting to

hug him.  It comes across as agitation.

Dobrynin rises from his chair.  Bobby rises with him.

Dobrynin heads for the door.  Half way there he turns back to

Bobby, deeply moved.  Deeply grateful.

INT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT

Kenny enters the Oval Office through his side door.  The

office is dark, only the desk lamp on.  Kenny's gaze moves

over the trappings of power: the carpet with the Presidential

Seal, the rocking chair by the fireplace, the desk.

And on the desk, tucked almost out of sight, sits a small,

humble wooden plaque.  It's turned to face the occupant of

the chair behind the desk.  Kenny reaches out, turns it

around.  It is the Breton's Fisherman's Prayer.

It reads: OH LORD, THY SEA IS GREAT, MY BOAT SO SMALL.

Kenny holds on the plaque a beat, and looks up at the open

French door to the Rose Garden.  The curtains swirl around

him in the wind as he goes through the door and out --

EXT. PORTICO - CONTINUOUS

-- onto the portico.  Standing there in the dark, by the

white neoclassical pillars of the cloister, are Bobby and the

President.  They're holding drinks.  Kenny joins them.

The President gestures out across the South Lawn to the

gleaming Washington Monument.

The President and Bobby nod at the justice of that remark.

Kenny looks at the President.  The President feels it, and

gazes back to him.

The three of them stare out at the glittering city.  The

grandness of the world lies before them, and they are

deciding its fate, and are humbled by the awfulness of it.

The silence is beyond power.

And for a long moment, they know not to disturb it.  There is

nothing left to say.  The President, at last, finishes his

drink.

He looks at Kenny.  Kenny nods.  He knows that now too.

EXT. O'DONNELL DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

Kenny's limo pulls away, leaving Kenny, coat in hand, at the

bottom of his driveway.  He watches it go, silently urging it

to return for him with some call from the President telling

him he's desperately needed.  But it doesn't.

He turns to his house.  The lights are all out.

He notices he's CLUTCHING the handle of his briefcase.  His

knuckles are white.  With conscious effort, he unfolds his

hand, letting the briefcase drop on the driveway.

He stands alone, stripped of his friends, his family, his

job... and in that moment, mute, impotent in the shadow of

Armageddon, Kenny is our Everyman of the Nuclear Age.

INT. O'DONNELL KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Helen stands in the kitchen, a ghostly white figure in her

robe, the windows open and curtain flapping as she breathes

the air.  Kenny enters.  He stands in the doorway.

And she knows the worst.

Kenny's voice breaks.

They take each other in their arms, the wisdom of the atomic

age so simple, so tenuous, every human life hanging by such a

thread... yet a thread so powerful.  The CAMERA RISES FROM

THEM, finding the OPEN WINDOW and the DARKNESS.

INT. O'DONNELL BEDROOM - DAWN

The RED DOME OF NUCLEAR FIRE rising over Washington.  It

roils the air in its expanding, blood-red glory.

It is the sun.  The dawn in the East.

PULL BACK THROUGH THE OPEN WINDOW.

SUPER: SUNDAY, OCTOBER 28TH.  DAY 13

into Kenny and Helen's bedroom.  And silence.  Kenny and

Helen lie together on the bed.  The light burns into Kenny's

half-shut eye.  Kenny is only dimly conscious of the light's

meaning.  Until the PHONE SHRILLS downstairs.

Kenny is instantly up, launched out of the room.

INT. O'DONNELL KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Kenny snatches the RED PHONE from its hook.

EXT. ST. STEPHEN'S CHURCH - DAY

THE CHURCH BELLS TOLL in raucous celebration.  Kenny, Helen

and the five O'DONNELL KIDS join the throng packing through

the doors to the church.  They're all smiling except Kenny

who searches fro faces in the CROWD.

And then he spots Bobby with his FAMILY.  Bobby grins at him.

That makes Kenny grin back.

But Kenny keeps looking.

Kenny spots him emerging from the Presidential limo,

surrounded by Secret Service Agents - John Kennedy.  His

FAMILY also is with him.

Kennedy, greeting well-wishers, a brilliant smile on his

face, is carried through the crowd toward Kenny and the doors

of the church.

EXT. MISSILE SITE - CUBA - DAY

the base has been half-dismantled over night.  Fuel trucks

pull away, lumping down the makeshift dirt road.  Across the

site missiles are lowered, their nose cones being removed.

A MISSILE on its transporter, Technicians crawling all over

it, COVERING IT with a tarp.

A massive Soviet Helicopter's rotors thunder as it lifts off,

cargo crates swaying under it, a CLOUD OF DUST FROM ITS WASH

FILLING THE SCREEN, WIPING US TO:

INT. CABINET ROOM - DAY

EXCOM laughing, celebrating, half-drunk already this Sunday

morning.  The President shushes the group.

The group quiets down.  The Presidents stares at them, calm,

firm.  They sober up quickly.  Kenny listens, expectant.

INT. WEST WING HALLWAY - DAY

Kenny rounds a corner.  McNamara, Bundy and McCone are

talking, excited, hushed, standing to one side, down the

hall.  Kenny eyes them as he draws closer, and then they

notice he's approaching.  Bundy nods him over, confidential.

Kenny sickens.  He tries to listen, but it all begins to

blur.

Bundy slaps Kenny on the back.  Kenny is pale.  Is what

they're saying possible?  But Bundy and McCone are too

wrapped up in their schemes to notice Kenny's distress.

And Kenny, sad, moved beyond all pity and loathing, realizes

it is possible.  They haven't gotten it.  He is speechless,

helplessly shaking his head.  Bundy finally sees something

isn't right with him.

Kenny can't speak.  Can't find the words.  But tongue-tied

finally manages:

McNamara and Bundy look at him funny.

Kenny just looks at them, eyes filled with sorrow.  They

begin to feel uncomfortable.

Kenny looks away, unable to bear it.

Kenny looks back at them.

They just stare at him.  And with secret smiles, superior

smiles, they nod.

But they don't understand, and together turn away.

Kenny watches them, heads bowed in discussion, disappear into

the labyrinth of the West Wing.  Kenny turns his back on

them.

The President stands at his mirror, tying a bow tie to a tux

for some Sunday special event.  Kenny gathers up his folder

from nearby breakfast table.

Kenny meets the President's gaze in the mirror, and the two

men know they have been to the same mountaintop.

A beat.  Kenny stands straight, ready for action, ready for

some necessary thing.  Ready to go back into the game.

Kenny starts to leave, but at the door, turns back.

The President looks at him in the mirror.

The President smiles an ever-so-faint smile.  Kenny turns and

leaves the room, vanishing, and as we HOLD on the empty

doorway, the simple, whistled melody of O'DONNELL ABOO drifts

from the hallway beyond, becoming our END MUSIC.

FADE OUT

SUPER:

Shortly after the crisis President Kennedy ordered a

reassessment of U.S.-Soviet relations, ushering a brief thaw

in the Cold War.  During this time, the Washington-Moscow

hotline was installed to ensure that in a future crisis,

miscommunication would not lead to nuclear war.

The President was assassinated on November 22nd, a year after

the crisis ended.

THE SUPER:

Bobby Kennedy ran for president in 1968.  After winning the

California primary, he called Kenny from the Ambassador Hotel

in Los Angeles and told him, "I finally feel like I'm out

from under my brother's shadow."

Bobby was assassinated minutes later.

THEN SUPER:

The members of EXCOM continued  to serve with distinction in

government in various capacities over the next three decades.

As Lyndon Johnson's Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara

urged containment of the Soviet threat in every theatre of

conflict around the world.  He ultimately advised President

Johnson to increase the U.S. military commitment to one of

these minor backwater conflicts: Vietnam.

AND FINALLY SUPER:

Kenny O'Donnell witnessed the President's assassination from

the car behind.  He went on to head the Peace Platform at the

1968 Democratic National  Convention, fighting to end the

Vietnam War.  He died in 1977.
