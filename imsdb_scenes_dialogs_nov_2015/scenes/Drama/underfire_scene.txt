SOMEWHERE IN AFRICA

EXT. GRASSY PLAINS - DUSK

BIRDS ARE FLUSHED FROM HIDING. A soldier carrying an automatic

weapon rises up out of the grass and looks around. A mortar

shell explodes nearby. There are no sound effects. He seems

unperturbed.

Several more explosions in the field. The soldier motions

with his arm and:

FIFTY MORE SOLDIERS RISE UP OUT OF THE GRASS More small

explosions.

FREEZE FRAME

With a click-click of a camera -- still no fx.

THE SOLDIERS RUN THROUGH THE GRASS FOLLOWING THEIR LEADER As

they do, the platoon leader waves his arms again.

FIVE ELEPHANTS CHARGE OUT OF THE SHRUBBERY Through a field

of small mortar explosions.

FREEZE FRAME

With the click-click of a camera.

THE ELEPHANTS CHARGE OUT ACROSS THE PLAINS Each carries an

enormous load of supplies, and each is ridden by a soldier

with a rifle.

A HELICOPTER GUNSHIP DIVES OUT OF THE SKY firing rockets at

the soldiers and elephants. A tribal mask is painted on the

nose of the chopper.

THE ELEPHANTS REAR UP IN TERROR

The soldiers on the elephants stand up and aim rifles at the

chopper and begin firing.

THE CHOPPER ATTACKS THE ELEPHANTS against an African sunset.

FREEZE FRAME

INT./EXT. LOBBY OF THE 'NEW PEOPLE'S HOTEL' - DAWN

A door slams o.s. and the figure of RUSSELL PRICE, 30, appears

at the top of some stairs. Sleepy-eyed, he pulls on a multi-

pocketed fishing vest over a baggy shirt. He carries a beat

up canvas bag over his shoulder.

A BLACK WOMAN, 40, sleeps at the lobby switchboard desk.

Another OLD BLACK MAN sweeps the floor. Price mumbles a 'good

morning' and goes to two vintage WW II vending machines --

one for candy, one for Coca-Cola. He buys two candy bars and

a coke, and begins eating his "breakfast" as he crosses the

lobby.

EXT. THE HOTEL - DAWN

JIMMY, a cab driver, has been sleeping in a chair against

the wall. Several street vendors have their wares laid out

on the sidewalk against the hotel. Some are shaded by

makeshift awnings, some are not. Jimmy rises as Price arrives;

there is familiar ritual in their greeting.

They cross the street together toward Jimmy's waiting taxi,

a hand-painted purple old American car with the words on the

door, "New People's Taxi Company" and Jimmy's name in script

above it. Price hands a candy bar to Jimmy.

Price hands him a wad of bills.

Jimmy smiles broadly, nodding, then points to the sky.

The two men get into the strange cab parked in front of an

open marketplace just starting to come alive; the cab drives

off.

EXT. A REMOTE AFRICAN VILLAGE - DAY

The taxi arrives, and Price gets out.

Price ambles over to stand in the early morning shade against

an old building. A hand-painted image of Che Guevarra --

with an X painted over it -- is on one wall. Price pulls a

joint from his pocket and lights up, taking a hit.

The sounds of war machinery soon interrupt the stillness.

Price hurries to the corner.

P.O.V. A JEEP LEADING AN ARMY CONVOY

Price pulls a handful of colored rags from his pocket and

picks out a yellow kerchief, tying it to his arm. Price then

steps boldly into the street in front of the approaching

convoy. He exchanges shouts with an officer in a jeep, and

with a motion is given permission to join.

PRICE CLIMBS INTO THE LAST OF THREE TROOP TRUCKS

Each truck is filled with perhaps 25 African soldiers in

khaki, each holding an automatic rifle. Another jeep follows,

towing a World War II cannon.

INSIDE THE TROOP TRUCK - DAY

The soldiers look over disinterestedly. Two dozen cases of

Coca-Cola are tied to a stretcher among stacks of guns.

As Price settles in for the ride, he begins pulling cameras

from his bag. Quickly and automatically, rarely looking, he

switches lenses, loads film, and prepares his cameras. He

has done this a thousand times.

A SINGLE WHITE SOLDIER -- OATES, rises from among the blacks,

and shakily makes his way toward Price. A mercenary dressed

in a ragged uniform of his own design, carries two machine

guns and a .45. He smiles broadly, recognizing Price. HODGE

slaps Price's hands as if they were teammates.

They nod. He laughs obscenely and deeply.

Pause.

Pause. Finally Oates starts laughing uncontrollably.

EXT. THE REBEL'S AIRFIELD - DAY

The convoy rumbles past a check-point into a small airfield

containing a motley collection of DC-3's and old planes. TWO

RUSSIAN ADVISORS and THREE CUBAN ADVISORS watch.

As he speaks, the cab of the truck is rocked with a mortar

shell and explodes. Soldiers scramble to safety. Some grab

the guns being transported.

TWO SOLDIERS GRAB THE STRETCHER OF COKE and start running

for safety. Smoke and explosions are everywhere -- they

abandon their cargo and run for cover.

OATES SCRAMBLES TO SAFE GROUND quickly and instinctively,

looking around wildly to "read" the situation. Price dives

next to him.

A SOLDIER IS HIT AND GOES DOWN NEARBY, staggering towards

Price and Oates.

A DC-3 GOES UP IN FLAMES IN THE BACKGROUND

THE WOUNDED SOLDIER REACHES FOR OATES who darts out quickly

and drags the injured Rebel to safety.

PRICE HAS HIS CAMERAS OUT AT ONCE and is firing away.

TWO REBEL SOLDIERS POINT TO THE STRETCHER OF COCA-COLA and

start moving toward it through the smoke. They want to rescue

the soft drinks.

PRICE LEAPS FROM HIS BUNKER AND RACES TOWARD THEM dangerously,

waving and shouting as he does.

They don't speak English but stop at his craziness.

PRICE STOPS AND AIMS HIS CAMERA, and as he does he motions

for the soldiers to continue.

P.O.V. THE FRAMED IMAGE -- SOLDIERS, SMOKE AND COKE IN B.G.

As the soldiers move toward the Coke, Price snaps picture

after picture.

A MORTAR EXPLOSION BLOWS THE COCA-COLA TO A MILLION BITS The

two soldiers stop short -- several more steps and they would

have been killed. Price's intrusion has accidentally saved

them. The two soldiers run toward safety, bewildered and

scared.

ON THE AIRFIELD - THE SMOKE CLEARS AND ALL IS CALM

Gradually the airfield comes back to life. Several teams of

medics run with stretchers from the hut and begin gathering

bodies. Rebel soldiers appear from every conceivable shelter

and move across the field.

Oates emerges and meets Price on the torn up runway amidst

the rubble. They look around at the devastation.

Oates starts to walk away, then stops and speaks earnestly,

as if trying to connect to a real world that doesn't exist.

Suddenly, the distant roar of a jet. All the soldiers on the

field scan the horizon; Price looks up. The air raid siren

goes off.

A JET DIVES OUT OF THE SKY TOWARD THE AIRFIELD OATES AND THE

SOLDIERS DIVE TO COVER

JET STREAKS OVERHEAD and, instead of rockets and bombs, it

drops something else:

THE SKY IS FILLED WITH A MILLION PIECES OF PAPER The jet

pulls out and disappears. All is quiet again as the million

papers flutter in the sky above the airfield.

Out of frustration a single soldier fires a couple of shots

at the paper.

Price grabs a piece of paper out of the air. It is:

A PICTURE OF A SWIMMING POOL IN FRONT OF A CALIFORNIA HOUSE

HE STARES AT THE IMAGE and turns it over. There is writing

on the backside in Spanish and Russian. He looks around.

OATES WANDERS OVER with a handful of the leaflets.

Price tries to read the writing on the back as Oates looks

at a leaflet familiarly.

OATES shakes hands with Price who looks at the picture.

Oates heads off across the runway as papers continue blowing

down out of the sky; Price looks up and speaks to himself.

INT. HOTEL ROOMS AT THE NEW PEOPLE'S HOTEL - NIGHT

CLAIRE STRYDER, 40, reads a report over the telephone as she

times the call with a stopwatch. A photograph of Claire's

high-school-aged daughter sits on her dresser.

ALEX GRAZIER, 50, struggles with his tie and a drink at a

dresser in the adjoining room. Their connected rooms are

littered with hand washed laundry and the paraphernalia of

their trade -- typewriters, tape decks, books, notes,

pictures.

Their love affairs of three years is ending.

Alex picks up a Melodica, a novelty wind instrument, and

tries to court her with "Caravan" as she files her story.

Though mildly put off, she maintains her cool throughout the

call. He thinks he's Paul Desmond.

She hangs up and rises more irritated than angered.

Quickly expressed, her anger passes.

Alex loves to be melo-dramatic and is quite conscious of his

ability to charm. He's also aware that it's worn off with

her.

Alex raises a drink.

She leaves -- he quickly puts on his coat and follows her.

INT. THE ELEVATOR GOING DOWN - NIGHT

She straightens his half-tied tie in an act of familiar

affection rather than motherliness. Nervousness. She speaks

calmly -- this is ground they have already covered.

They both smile slightly as the elevator comes to a stop.

The door doesn't open, and the light flickers.

He bangs the door with his fist. It opens, and they enter a

dismal hallway. The sounds of a party come from beyond.

As they approach the door to the party, he speaks with new

toughness.

INT. THE ROOM WITH THE PARTY - NIGHT

A cheer goes up for Alex as he and Claire enter. Party hats,

booze, hand-made signs reading "Bon Voyage," etc. Fifteen

journalists of varying nationalities cover this backwater

war.

Though both upset, they act as if everything is normal.

PRICE STANDS ON A CHAIR AT THE CENTER summoning Alex who

moves through the group with ease, instantly at home. Price

holds up a bottle of champagne in toast.

Alex climbs on a chair next to Price who puts his arm around

him.

However miserable, Alex shines in these situations. He raises

his hand -- silence.

Claire slips to the side bar and pours herself a drink,

watching Alex and shaking her head with some affection.

JIMMY, THE CAB DRIVER, ENTERS WITH A CAKE covered with

candles. The crowd parts for the cake shaped like the country

of Chad. The crowd begins singing "Caravan" in a half-drunken

tribute to a man they like and respect.

PRICE MOVES AROUND THE ROOM TAKING PICTURES of the party; it

is all casual, silly, fun.

THROUGH CAMERA P.O.V.'S OF ALEX IN A PARTY HAT, whip pan to

CABBY WITH THE CAKE, whip pan to DRUNKEN JOURNALISTS.

THROUGH CAMERA P.O.V. OF CLAIRE -- FREEZE FRAME, pan follows

her as she moves through the room -- FREEZE FRAME, she picks

up another drink and leaves through a side door -- FREEZE

FRAME.

ALEX GIVES IN AND JOINS THE SINGING, enjoying his own tribute

once he has managed to give in to it.

INT. THE DARKROOM - RED LIGHTS

Claire's face is also covered with tears as she smokes,

wandering idly among clothespinned photos. A part of her

life is ending -- life with Alex -- but it's not ending

neatly.

A ROW OF HANGING PHOTOGRAPHS catches her eye. She stops and

looks closely -- then laughs in spite of herself at a series

of pictures: PHOTO OF A TALL AFRICAN NATIVE WITH A COCK SO

LONG IT IS TIED IN A KNOT; PHOTO OF A BEAUTIFULLY BREASTED

AFRICAN WOMAN; PHOTO OF SEVERAL POSING SOLDIERS; PHOTO OF A

PHOTO -- THE RANCH HOUSE WITH POOL; PHOTO SELF-PORTRAIT OF

PRICE BLOWING SMOKE RINGS; PHOTO OF CLAIRE AND ALEX IN HAPPIER

DAYS.

CLAIRE PULLS THE PHOTO OF ALEX AND HER from the clip and

looks at it.

THE DOOR OPENS, AND PRICE ENTERS

He notices the picture she's looking at.

Silence. Price moves behind her and gently kisses her on the

ear. She smiles quickly and nervously.

He kisses her on the neck.

The sounds of the party can be heard. He ignores them and

moves around her, trying to kiss her on the lips. She puts

her hand over his mouth.

Price reacts strongly, flaring slightly and withdrawing.

She heads to the door; Price stays. She stops before getting

there, hesitates, then pulls the PHOTO OF THE ELEPHANT from

the string and returns to Price, handing him the photo.

He doesn't respond. They stand for several moments -- the

sounds of the party get louder. She turns and heads to Alex's

celebration, leaving Price alone in the darkroom.

PRICE LOOKS AT CLAIRE AS SHE LEAVES, stares aimlessly for

several moments, then focuses back on his PHOTO OF THE

ELEPHANTS.

EXT. THE STREETS OF MANAGUA - THE CAPITOL - AFTERNOON

CLOSE ON: TIME MAGAZINE WITH COVER PHOTO OF THE ELEPHANTS,

gradually PULL BACK to reveal other magazines, candy, cigars,

Nicaraguan toys, all in a corner shop, and finally:

A FIRE TRUCK LEADS A PROCESSION through the streets -- a

group of middle class Nicaraguan women carry a banner that

reads "Our Revolution is in Christ" (in Spanish), followed

by three Catholic PRIESTS in bright robes, followed by a

sound truck with P.A. system, followed by hundreds of

townspeople carrying banana leaves and religious signs. All

are singing a Catholic hymn in a swaying, hypnotic rhythm.

Small red and black flags are scattered throughout.

A CAB DRIVING THROUGH THE STREETS runs into the parade and

stops. Price sits in the front seat -- his luggage is tied

precariously to the roof. The trunk of the cab has been

smashed in beyond repair. Price hops out of the cab with his

camera bag -- he doesn't know what the parade is about but

it looks great. He hands the cabbie some money to stay nearby.

He runs to join the procession.

PRICE HOPS ONTO THE RUNNING BOARD OF THE FIRE TRUCK and almost

simultaneously his light meter is out. HE is surrounded by

images: SMALL GIRLS DRESSED AS ANGELS LINE THE STREET,

TOWNSPEOPLE HANG FROM DOORWAYS AND WINDOWS, ICE CREAM CARTS

AMONG RELIGIOUS ICONS, SOLDIERS WITH GUNS STAND IN SMALL

GROUPS ALONG THE PARADE ROUTE.

PRICE IS QUICKLY TAKING PICTURES OF EVERYTHING, changing

cameras, occasionally taking a quick light reading; his

actions are instinctive and automatic. Suddenly:

TEN YOUNG TEENAGERS BURST INTO THE PARADE They wear red and

black handkerchiefs, baseball caps, and strange masks. They

are chanting:

A LARGE PAINTING OF THE FACE OF RAFAEL is carried aloft on a

stick, draped with red and black scarves.

PRICE PHOTOGRAPHS the boys and the painting.

NATIONAL GUARD SOLDIERS SHOVE INTO THE PARADE Up and down

the street they spring into action, running for position

with their guns.

An ice cream vendor is knocked down, a mother clutches her

"angel" daughter, another child is whisked inside a door as

the Soldiers break into the procession.

THE "MUCHACHOS" WITH RAFAEL TURN TO RUN but realize that the

soldiers have cut off their escape.

THREE SOLDIERS BREAK into the parade and are separated from

the boys only by a group of Priests. Trapped, the boys panic,

but as the SOLDIERS push towards them:

THE PRIESTS BLOCK THE SOLDIERS and intentionally scuffle

with them, allowing the boys just enough time to dart into a

house. One of the boys drops the picture of Rafael as he

heads in the door.

THE CROWD PUSHES FORWARD, the route to the door is blocked

off, and the boys escape.

SOLDIERS FIND THE PORTRAIT OF RAFAEL and shoot it full of

holes with their automatic weapons.

PRICE PHOTOGRAPHS "RAFAEL" as his image is ripped to shreds

with bullets.

The singing and the parade march on.

EXT. THE INTERCONTINENTAL HOTEL IN MANAGUA - LATER - DAY

Overlooking Managua is a sub-tropical paradise that seems

far removed from a brutal civil war, this one time tourist

watering hole serves as home base to the international press.

The cab pulls up, and Price gets out. The driver unties his

luggage from the roof as TWO PRESS CORPS MEMBERS recognize

Price and greet him as an old friend.

EXT. THE HOTEL POOL AND OUTDOOR BAR - DAY (DUSK)

ALEX SITS WITH A BEAUTIFUL NICARAGUAN WOMAN, 35, at a table

as PRESS CORPS MEMBERS mingle. A man we will come to know as

HUB KITTLE, 40, dressed New York casual, table hops in the

b.g.

PRICE SEES ALEX and sneaks over to drop the Time magazine

over his shoulder onto the table in front of him. Without

looking up, Alex knows Price has arrived. He smiles.

They shake hands warmly, and Price sits down. Price points

to the cover as a beer is served.

Russell acknowledges ISELA CRUZ sitting with Alex.

IN THE BACKGROUND CLAIRE WALKS INTO THE POOL-BAR AREA She

carries her handbag and some papers -- she stops short seeing

Price sitting with Alex. She hesitates, starts toward them,

stops, and sits down at the bar at the opposite end of the

pool.

Price sees her, and she sees Price. They pretend they don't.

Price turns to Isela and launches into a stream of broken,

chauvinistic Spanish with his usual elegance.

Price looks at each of them and decides not to push.

Alex stands to help Isela from her chair. Price presses on,

instinctively and effortlessly.

Alex turns to Isela, who stops as she rises.

A beat, then Price asks his question almost sexually, as if

he thinks he could seduce Isela, Rafael, the whole war.

She starts to leave again, and again he stops her.

Isela seems to welcome the question. Her tone is less flip,

and she focuses hard on Price.

She touches his Time magazine, kisses Alex on the cheek, and

floats magically through the pool area.

Price frames her with his fingers as if composing a shot.

P.O.V. OF ISELA THROUGH PRICE'S FINGERS Isela kisses another

journalist, grabs someone's hand, and lands gracefully at

another table.

ALEX PLACES HIS HAND OVER PRICE'S "FRAME" blocking out his

view of the sexy Isela. Though Alex's tone is gentle, the

threat is obvious.

Price takes the hint.

Alex chooses his words carefully and speaks slowly.

Silence and an uneasiness that Alex intended. Price manages

a smile.

Alex smiles disarmingly.

CLAIRE RISES AT THE OPPOSITE BAR, picks up her papers, and

heads straight for the two men with a bounce in her step.

BOTH MEN ARE A BIT SURPRISED AT HER ENTRANCE and she hands a

stack of mail to Alex.

She shakes Price's hand in a friendly manner that comes out

awkwardly, then races past the moment to address and entertain

both men.

They turn to Price as if everyone knows who Tacho is.

A bit of tension and awkwardness -- Claire quickly takes

control and changes the tone.

INT. THE VIKING CLUB OF MANAGUA - NIGHT

Corrugated metal roofs, thatched hut booths, a strange

combination of decorative and architectural devices. DAISY

WILLIAMS, a large black woman from Nicaragua, sings "I Left

My Heart in San Francisco" with a mediocre jazz group.

HUB KITTLE is present, and other journalists drop by the

table to say hello.

A BOY PHOTOGRAPHER, 13, aims an ancient bellows type polaroid

at a booth in which Claire sits between Alex and Price. They

are holding a pose indefinitely while the boy struggles with

the camera. They hold up the TIME COVER and a couple of beers

in celebration, and when he finally snaps the picture -- no

flash.

The boy puts the camera down disappointedly.

The three journalists relax their pose.

ON THE BANDSTAND Daisy has just finished "San Francisco" and

spots Alex, motioning to him.

Daisy applauds lightly for Alex to join them. Alex is equally

pleased and embarrassed.

Alex excuses himself and joins Daisy on the bandstand. Price

and Claire are left alone in the booth as Price hands the

repaired camera back to the boy.

ALEX AT THE PIANO begins a slow, easy cocktail version of

"Stardust," the song of his generation perhaps, and he seems

happy, seduced by his own chords.

PRICE AND CLAIRE RESUME THEIR POSE, and this time the camera

FLASHES. Price pays for the picture from the boy.

At first there is a moment of awkwardness between them.

She smiles and relaxes a bit at the typical Price remark.

ALEX BEGINS SINGING as he plays. He sings like a trumpet

player -- no voice but great phrasing. He half smiles as he

sings, enjoying the song and enjoying making them

uncomfortable.

ALEX AT THE PIANO

BACK AT THE BOOTH

They don't really want to talk about Alex though his presence

is unavoidable. Price changes gears, gets slightly goofy,

and steers the conversation to more comfortable turf.

She knows what he means, but she wants to tease him a bit

first.

Price is impressed, and yet another new face drops by the

booth -- they both recognize and see him coming, a

contemporary of Price, REGIS FLYNN, a scraggly British

journalist who heads over to their table holding three beers.

Regis slides into their booth, happy to see them.

He nods; they all sip beers and watch Alex sing.

INT. THE NIGHT CLUB KITCHEN

A teenage DISHWASHER looks around nervously, then pulls a

paper sack from off the shelf, removing a strange mask from

it. He pulls the mask over his head. Then from the bag he

removes a hand-made zip gun, puts a bullet in it, and darts

into the shadows of a nook, waiting.

BACK TO THE BOOTH where Regis softly croons a few bars of

"Stardust" into Claire's mike. The three of them are having

a good time, mildly drunk at best, and uninhibited.

EXT. THE CLUB

As we hear Alex's gentle rendition of the standard, a NECKING

COUPLE moves back into the shadows of the club. Each pulls

on a mask, as in the b.g.:

ISELA AND AN ELEGANT MAN ARRIVE AT THE CLUB

The man, somehow out of place, dresses with casual continental

style, not overdone but expensive and tasteful -- clearly

from another world. He wears a neat hat and moves gracefully.

Isela looks stunning, dressed for the evening. The DOORMAN

greets them familiarly.

Isela casually checks her watch as they enter the club.

The masked couple in the shadows check their watches.

INT. THE VIKING CLUB

As Isela and the man enter, commanding attention without

trying. Isela stops at the piano long enough to kiss Alex

gently before sitting in the booth with the man.

IN PRICE'S BOOTH the new arrivals have caught their attention --

Price and Alex still clown slightly, and Claire teases them.

P.O.V. OF JAZY LIGHTING ISELA'S CIGARETTE

THE WAITER ARRIVES AT PRICE'S BOOTH and sets down three shrimp

cocktails and more champagne, as:

INT. THE BACK DOOR OF THE CLUB

It opens quickly, and three more MEN IN MASKS enter quickly.

BACK TO THE BOOTH as the waiter speaks with a firm coolness.

A FACE IN A MASK MOVES QUICKLY PAST PRICE'S TABLE

ANOTHER MASKED FACE COMES OUT OF THE KITCHEN The dishwasher

waves a gun.

TWO MASKED FACES -- THE COUPLE -- ENTER THROUGH THE FRONT

DOOR The woman carries an automatic rifle and guards the

entrance.

THREE MASKED FACES APPEAR Almost materialize from thin air,

moving silently and without commotion. The music winds down

slowly. (Six Guerrillas total)

A GUERRILLA QUICKLY SPRAYS AN IMAGE ON THE WALL With a few

deftly drawn strokes, the FACE OF RAFAEL magically appears.

The name "RAFAEL" is written under the face, then other names

and revolutionary slogans. As this takes place:

A WOMAN GUERRILLA HAS A GUN AT THE HEAD OF A NICARAGUAN

BUSINESSMAN The middle-aged, well-dressed local sits with

his wife and two other men. They freeze in fear, the nightclub

freezes, as the GUERRILLAS take control of the room swiftly

and smoothly.

ONE GUERRILLA FACES THE NICARAGUAN BUSINESSMAN at the table

and speaks loudly but without panic. The masked Guerrillas

around the room are serious but nervous.

The BUSINESSMAN refuses. The GUERRILLA LEADER takes a hand

grenade from his pocket and pulls the pin without hesitation,

then holds the grenade in front of him fearlessly, inches

away from the Businessman's face.

The Businessman rises slowly. The LEADER motions toward the

back door of the club.

The woman with the gun shoves it into the man's head forcing

him to move toward the kitchen door.

PRICE TAKES PICTURES QUICKLY WITH A TINY CAMERA that fits

into the palm of his hand. Neatly, surreptitiously, and calmly --

Price is coolest in any crisis.

CLAIRE PUNCHES ON HER TINY TAPE RECORDER instinctively, and

a tiny red light comes on.

THE BUSINESSMAN IS SHOVED TO THE DOOR He hesitates, afraid

to leave the room. The Guerrilla shoves the grenade in his

face; the woman sticks the gun into his neck even deeper.

MASKED GUERRILLA AT THE FRONT DOOR SHOUTS FOR THEM TO HURRY

THE BANDMEMBERS -- INCLUDING ALEX -- BACK AWAY FROM THE

BANDSTAND Alex trips over the drum set slightly -- a clanging

clash of cymbals startles everyone, and as the drama freezes:

THE KITCHEN DOOR SWINGS OPEN, AND THE BOY PHOTOGRAPHER EMERGES

Innocently, the young boy struts out of the kitchen to see

what's going on, and as he does the DOOR STRIKES THE ARM OF

THE GUERRILLA WITH THE GRENADE, and:

THE GRENADE IS KNOCKED FREE For an instant, everything

freezes, and:

THE GRENADE ROLLS ACROSS THE FLOOR Daisy Williams, the singer,

runs away screaming as the grenade comes to rest near a

crowded section of the club.

A Guerrilla guarding the side door rushes for it, picks it

up, and as he does:

THE GRENADE EXPLODES IN THE GUERRILLA'S HAND A brutal

explosion -- the ceiling caves in partially, the musical

instruments explode, and:

THE SANDINISTA GUERRILLAS DART FROM THE ROOM through various

doors. The boy photographer lies bloodied. The Guerrilla who

picked up the grenade is a barely recognizable corpse. The

Businessman is soiled but unhurt.

ONE HALF OF THE CLUB BREAKS OUT IN FLAME As a broken gas

pipe feeds a sudden outburst of fire, the club's patrons

panic -- screaming and shoving towards the door as the ROOM

LIGHTS UP, and:

PRICE'S LIGHT METER IS OUT AT ONCE followed quickly by a

35mm camera, quickly clicking off picture after picture of

the club amid the flames and panic. The new light makes his

job easier.

PRICE TAKES A LIGHT READING near the body of the boy

photographer. He sees the boy's camera lying nearby. Price

puts away his light meter and feels the boy's pulse, then

puts his ear to the boy's heart -- making sure he is not

still alive.

LA GUARDIA SOLDIERS AND FIREMEN FILL THE ROOM

INT. THE PRESS ROOM AT THE INTERCONTINENTAL HOTEL - LATER

The chaos of a busy, cramped Telex room. A switchboard --

several journalists trying to place phone calls. Press come

and go -- coffee, cigarettes, and half-eaten sandwiches.

CLAIRE TEARS A STORY OFF THE TELEX while Price stands to the

side of the action eating a sandwich and watching.

ALEX STANDS AT THE CENTER OF IT ALL Established as the senior

figure (or one of them) to whom other, younger journalists

come for information.

A YOUNG JOURNALIST, a Time stringer, is slightly distraught

on the phone, and interrupts Alex's dealing with others,

cupping the phone, to announce:

Alex grabs the phone in disgust and launches in.

While Charlie argues on the other end of the phone, Alex

initials papers and performs several jobs at once.

HUB KITTLE has been floating through the room and, upon

hearing the word "fascist," takes offense and approaches

Alex.

Alex ignores Hub though he is slightly pestered by him, and

continues on the phone as he initials papers brought to him.

Alex spots Price who is standing nearby, still eating a

sandwich, still enjoying the high energy buzz of the room.

Alex directs his next line so that Price cannot fail to get

the message. Alex plays the moment coolly.

Hub nods seriously, in agreement. Price turns. Alex smiles.

Price smiles. Alex hangs up, grumbling, then turns his

attention to the persistent Hub Kittle.

Alex is irritated but fascinated.

Alex is incredulous that Somoza employs a New York P.R. firm.

Hub is professionally used to this reaction -- no panic.

Alex turns to leave; Hub corners him.

Alex turns to other business though Hub persists.

ELSEWHERE IN THE ROOM a young NICARAGUAN WOMAN, 18, is talking

to Claire. She seems to be part of the local press.

A TELEPHONE OPERATOR CALLS TO CLAIRE through the chaos.

Claire sighs at the bad timing but seems delighted to be

interrupted by her daughter, and brushes aside a Stringer

forcing paperwork upon her. Claire takes the phone into a

bare, adjacent hallway for some privacy.

IN A BARE HALLWAY Claire talks to her daughter.

P.O.V. FROM THE TELEX ROOM TO CLAIRE Price knows this is not

his world, and he wanders outside.

EXT. MANAGUAN STREET NEAR THE HOTEL - LATER THAT NIGHT

Price bounces along, whistling, "San Francisco." An occasional

Guardia jeep or taxi rumbles past. He strolls up the walkway

of a house from which comes a strange, blue glow.

INT. THE MONEYCHANGERS HOUSE - NIGHT

Blue walls, bare bulbs, several pictures on the wall, and an

old woman lying in a hammock. Music in the b.g. Price

approaches her and hands her a $100 bill -- there is a brief

negotiation of the black market value.

She shrugs, declaring the negotiation ended, and leaves the

room to change the dollar into cordobas. Price idly studies

the pictures on the wall:

PICTURE OF ANASTAZIO SOMOZA IN WHITE, PICTURE OF THE VIRGIN

OF GUADALUPE, PICTURE OF SANTA CLAUS, FADED NEWSPHOTO OF

HANK AARON HITTING HIS 715TH HOME RUN.

PRICE SMILES AND TURNS RIGHT INTO A SHARP BAYONET mounted to

a rifle held threateningly by a Guardia soldier.

THE SMALL ROOM IS FILLED WITH NATIONAL GUARDS We haven't

heard them enter over the sounds of music and our

preoccupation with the pictures.

No answer. Price pulls a thick passport and press credentials

from a pocket, handing them to the Officer in charge.

The officer looks at Price's passport photo, studies it

briefly and takes the passport. He nods.

A rifle butt is jammed violently into Price's belly -- he

doubles over. The Officer nods, and Price is led away.

As the Guard hauls him outside, the OLD WOMAN appears in the

doorway with a stack of local currency.

INT. MILITARY HOLDING CELL - NIGHT

Price is led into a dark cell where another PRISONER, 50,

lies in street clothes on the floor. The Prisoner is spat

upon by the Guards and kicked awake. Price cringes.

The Guards laugh and leave. The Prisoner rises to his feet.

Price keeps his distance. The Prisoner looks in bad shape.

Price hands him a cigarette and lights it. A long, deep drag.

The Prisoner Priest looks at Price with disdain.

The Prisoner sits down in the corner ignoring Price who is

surprised to be treated so despicably.

INT. A BRIGHTLY LIT ROOM

Price is led into a lineup of 10 people, all Nicaraguans.

The room is narrow and so brightly lit that at first he covers

his eyes.

FIGURES MOVE IN THE SHADOWS A Guardia soldier moves up and

down the lineup, stopping to point at a prisoner. In the

line we recognize the WAITER from the Viking Club. Price

speaks to the soldier in a calm, reasoned tone.

The soldier whirls at Price in a rage out of all proportion

to Price's tone, shouting:

Price holds up his hands -- he may be fearless, but he's not

stupid. The soldier pulls a knife, then pulls his own tongue

from his mouth, and makes motions with the knife as if cutting

out his tongue. The message is clear -- Price doesn't speak.

The soldier walks up to the Waiter and points. The Waiter is

frightened.

Through the shadows we see an officer talking with a civilian

in a hat. The civilian points to a door.

THE WAITER IS LED AWAY THROUGH A DOOR protesting desperately

as he goes. The soldier moves to the next prisoner -- he too

is led away. This repeats itself until the soldier arrives

at price.

THE SOLDIER POINTS TO PRICE

PRICE'S P.O.V. THROUGH THE SHADOWS The civilian is in a

discussion with the officer -- it is clear that his opinion

affects the decisions. For a moment Price doesn't know where

he's going to be led. The civilian points to a different

door -- it opens -- and Price steps down off the display

rack into a room.

THROUGH THE DOOR as Price steps through, the action continues

with the other Nicaraguan prisoners. Price looks around

quickly, but the Civilian and Officer are gone. He is quickly

shown into a bare office.

INT. THE BARE ROOM

Pictures on the wall of Somoza and the FLAG RAISING AT IWO

JIMA. Price's cameras and bag sit on a desk.

P.O.V. THE CIVILIAN THROUGH A DOOR -- IT IS MARCEL JAZY His

rumpled elegance is at odds with the brutal surroundings.

The door closes.

A SENIOR OFFICER ENTERS THE BARE ROOM, and Price addresses

him at once.

The Officer reaches for one of Price's cameras and hands it

to him, but as he does:

THE CAMERA DROPS TO THE GROUND AND BREAKS -- SILENCE The

Officer would love for Price to get angry.

Price smiles barely, and refuses to pop off.

Price puts his cameras in his bag, and as he is shown from

the room he notices a copy of the TIME MAGAZINE WITH ELEPHANT

sitting on the desk.

Price is shown to a door, handed over to a soldier, and led

outside into the night.

EXT. MILITARY PRISON - DAWN

Claire stands at the main doorway surrounded by GUARDS, an

OFFICER, and an unidentified CIVILIAN -- she is arguing with

them in rapid Spanish, not allowing them to get in a word.

PRICE IS SHOWN OUT A DOOR IN THE BACKGROUND and sees her.

They hurry toward each other and embrace briefly. The Guards

watch it all curiously.

They walk away together.

EXT. GARDEN COURTYARD OF MARCEL JAZY - DAY LATER

Marcel Jazy stands, drink in hand, looking slightly rumpled

in the daylight, slightly older, but more charming and self-

effacing than his first impression indicated. His two story

Mediterranean style house is in slight disrepair; the gardens

are scraggly and overgrown. The pool is empty. Jazy addresses

Price and Claire.

As he speaks, the questioning comes to a sudden halt as a

SPECTACULAR LOOKING WOMAN emerges from the shadows of the

house into the light of the courtyard. She is tall, Latin,

and besides high heels wears only a shiny, high fashion

swimsuit, cut high on the legs.

Price, Claire, and Jazy stop to watch as the woman stops to

look into the empty pool.

Jazy leans in very coolly to Price and Claire as he pours an

extra glass of wine and speaks softly in English again.

He carries the glass of wine to the woman, smiling warmly.

Jazy pushes a lounge chair over to her and hands her a glass

of wine. The woman unfolds gracefully into a lounge chair in

the sun. Very sexy. She reaches for and kisses Jazy's hand

affectionately -- he kisses her forehead. She feels better

now.

Jazy motions for Claire and Price to follow him inside.

INT. JAZY'S HOUSE - DAY

The pool is visible in b.g. His house, like the pool, is

rumpled and slightly sloppy though it betrays the taste of

its occupant -- books everywhere, pictures on the wall,

nothing cheap or tacky but everything is well worn.

He looks at them directly.

He refills their glasses.

The red light of her recorder is on. She smiles slightly,

undisturbed, and turns it off.

Price and Claire are almost afraid to speak, afraid to

interrupt this strange performance.

Claire interrupts with a smile.

Jazy smiles slightly before confirming.

They all smile at this complication. Price is impressed.

Jazy changes the subject with fluent and disturbing ease.

Silence. They don't know how to respond.

THEIR P.O.V. AS MISS PANAMA STRETCHES LIKE AN ENORMOUS CAT

They all are slightly entertained and glad for the relief.

Unsure what to say next, Price notices a picture on the wall:

CLOSEUP - A BLOWN-UP FRAMED PHOTO OF THE RANCH HOUSE WITH

POOL

The same picture we saw on the leaflets in Africa.

The voice of Miss Panama.

He doesn't wait for an answer, but excuses himself and goes

out to tend to Miss Panama.

P.O.V. OF JAZY AND MISS PANAMA BY THE EMPTY POOL as Jazy

touches her, whispers, and she waves to Claire and Price.

INT. PRICE'S HOTEL BATHROOM - DAY

Early morning. Price lathers up with shaving cream for the

first time, cleaning up. As he applies the lather he stops,

and slowly draws a face on the mirror with shaving cream

until he is staring at:

THE IMAGE OF RAFAEL IN SHAVING CREAM ON THE MIRROR

EXT. NICARAGUAN COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

A RENTED CAR WITH WHITE FLAGS turns onto the road to Leon.

Price drives, eats, and reads a map. Claire takes the map

from him and reads it herself. They seem to enjoy their first

moment alone without Alex looking over their shoulder. A

small band-aid is on Price's clean shaven cheek.

She reaches out and touches his band-aid.

PASSING SHOT OF A CLUSTER OF ROADSIDE CROSSES marking a series

of graves. Immediately the tone in Claire's voice changes,

sobered by the reminder of war.

Again their glibness is interrupted by what they came to

see. Even as they joke, they watch the landscape with concern.

REFUGEES ARE STREAMING OUT OF LEON, mostly women and children,

some old men, carrying their possessions. Soldiers stand

around.

A GUARDIA ROADBLOCK ON A HILL OVERLOOKING THE CITY

The press car pulls up to a stop. Price and Claire get out

quickly, hand their credentials to a soldier, and open the

trunk and the hood. As the car is searched they look down at

the city.

P.O.V. LEON AS A PLANE CIRCLES FIRING ROCKETS AND SMOKE RISES

from several places in the town. The sound of gunfire.

The soldier laughs at the journalists and hands back the

credentials.

Price speaks in English knowing he can't be understood.

Price and Claire remove their things from the car, and Price

takes the distributor cap as well as the keys. They walk

over and look down the road leading into the city under seige.

MORE REFUGEES EVACUATE THE TOWN -- it is a most uninviting

sight. The plane passes over the town in the distance firing

rockets.

Price responds by flashing his light meter in the air, taking

a quick, nervous reading.

EXT. STREET INTO LEON - DAY

PRICE AND CLAIRE WALK SLOWLY INTO LEON

Looking around warily as they go, they are the only people

entering the town. Claire speaks softly into her tape recorder

as they walk in, recording the event without editorializing.

THE BODY OF A YOUNG MAN lies ignored on the sidewalk. They

continue walking and soon come to:

AN INTERSECTION HELD BY LA GUARDIA TROOPS WITH A TANQUETTA

Price and Claire duck into a doorway, protected in effect by

the Government soldiers who wait silently, guns ready, around

the corner of a building. We see what they're waiting for.

A YOUNG SANDINISTA COMES OUT OF A BUILDING a block away,

holding a handgun. Momentarily confused, he begins running

toward us, toward the soldiers waiting in ambush. The

Guerrilla races quickly to his waiting death, and as he turns

the corner right into a dozen Guardia troops:

THE GUARDIA GUNS OPEN UP ON THE YOUNG GUERRILLA, killing him

instantly.

CLAIRE TURNS HER HEAD AWAY unable to watch.

PRICE RECORDS THE EVENT WITH HIS CAMERA

THE GUARDIA FOLLOW THE TANQUETTA SLOWLY down the street toward

the Rebel youth's house. Suddenly the intersection is empty.

PRICE AND CLAIRE MOVE DOWN A SIDESTREET SLOWLY as:

SEVERAL GUERRILLA MUCHACHOS DART OUT OF AN ALLEY with

sharpened sticks, a spear gun, and one home-made gun. The

Muchachos hesitate briefly, lost, and see Price.

THE MUCHACHOS QUICKLY POSE FOR A PICTURE motioning for Price

to record them. They pose instantly in "tough-guy" posture.

PRICE TAKES THEIR PICTURE and just as quickly they dart away

through a bombed out building.

THREE SANDINISTAS LEAP OFF A ROOFTOP and race toward Claire

and Price who freeze:

For a moment they aren't sure what this means -- are they in

trouble? The Sandinistas shove past the two journalists,

pushing open a doorway and disappearing inside. For a moment

Price and Claire are alone on the street.

THE DOOR OPENS AGAIN SLOWLY and a middle-aged WOMAN appears,

motioning for them to come inside.

INT. PEDRO'S HOUSE - DAY

The Three Sandinistas, dressed half in khaki, half recycled

disco, are pleading with a young man, PEDRO, 15.

One of the Sandinistas brings Pedro his rumpled baseball

jersey from another room.

Pedro sees Price and Claire and is more interested in them.

He speaks in broken but understandable English.

Pedro lights up, and runs to a shelf where he returns with a

baseball he is signing.

Pedro is more interested in the two Americans.

Pedro hands Claire the baseball as the Sandinistas plead

with Pedro for his help. He is more interested in getting

the baseball delivered to Tippy Martinez. Claire accepts the

ball graciously, exchanges awkward glances with Price, and

puts it in her shoulder bag.

They go to the door and open it a crack to look out.

P.O.V. THE TANQUETTA PASSES as Soldiers kick open doors across

the street.

The Sandinistas go to a corner of the room and push a book

shelf out of the way. A large hole has been broken in the

wall. They climb through the hole into the living room of

the next house; the woman pushes the shelf back over the

hole with great effort.

INT. THE NEXT HOUSE - DAY

A family huddles in the corner as the MAN OF THE HOUSE pulls

back a couch and a hanging blanket, revealing another hole

knocked in the wall. The Sandinistas, Pedro, Claire and Price

scramble through.

P.O.V. THROUGH A SERIES OF DOOR-SIZED HOLES IN THE WALLS of

all the houses on the block, connecting the homes with a

secret passageway. The six of them race through the houses,

each hole opening and then closing magically.

INT. THE KITCHEN OF A TINY SIDEWALK RESTAURANT - DAY

The Three Sandinistas, Pedro, Claire, and Price emerge. A

WOMAN, 50, runs the cafe and welcomes them. The SIX crawl so

as not to be seen from the street; they stop long enough to

survey the plaza.

P.O.V. THE CENTRAL PLAZA OF LEON DOMINATED BY A HUGE CATHEDRAL

Half a dozen bodies are scattered across the plaza. Otherwise,

it is empty.

P.O.V. SIX GUARDIA SNIPERS IN THE CHURCH TOWER control the

plaza. As we watch, they fire off occasional shots in

different directions--there is no way to cross the plaza.

THE WOMAN PULLS A TRAY OF "CONTACT BOMBS" from the oven,

home-made grenades that look like muffins on a tray. Pedro

grabs one and pretends to bite into it. The Sandinistas start

to laugh and catch themselves as Pedro clowns. Claire and

Price aren't sure what the "muffins" are and don't respond;

mostly they are on edge. The contact bombs are put in a sack.

The woman opens a trap door in the floor, and the six of

them climb down a ladder into a tunnel.

INT. TUNNEL UNDERNEATH THE FLOOR - DAY

Pedro leads them with a candle through a dark passage under

the street. Overhead we hear gunfire. Rats scurry, and water

runs through an open sewer.

INT. THE CATHEDRAL - DAY

A tapestry rug is pulled away, and Pedro's head appears. He

climbs out and soon all the party is in the church. A PRIEST

leads them quickly through an immense, nearly. European

interior of ornate altars and burning candles. The small

party is led to a small corner of the sanctuary where a long,

rickety ladder leads up to the roof.

THE SANDINISTAS SCRAMBLE UP THE LADDER as it sways. Pedro

follows with his sack of contact bombs. Then Price goes up

as the Priest holds the ladder. The American is much larger

than the Nicaraguans -- the ladder squeaks and sways, and

when he is nearly at the top:

THE LADDER CRACKS as Price reaches the top and is helped to

safety. The Priest steadies the ladder now made unsafe and

clearly Claire wants to go onto the roof.

Claire looks at Price -- she wants to go on the roof but the

sound of close gunfire settles the dilemma. Claire hurries

off to safety with the Priest.

EXT. THE ROOFTOP OF THE CATHEDRAL OF LEON - LATE IN DAY

THREE SANDINISTAS, PEDRO, AND PRICE EMERGE FROM A TUNNEL

onto a lower level of the cathedral rooftop where a body

lies. They are exposed immediately and automatic weapons

fire opens up on them -- the Sandinistas flatten against a

wall, quickly becoming separated from Price and Pedro.

TWO SANDINISTAS RACE FOR COVER BEHIND A CUPOLA in a move

that is equally daring and foolish. The diversion draws fire

from the two soldiers.

PRICE'S LIGHT METER IS INSTANTLY OUT TAKING READINGS as Pedro

huddles with him, curious at this strange act.

TWO GUARDIA MOVE INTO POSITION TO FLUSH OUT THE SANDINISTAS

as they hide behind the cupolas. The hidden Third Guerrilla

opens fire killing a Guardia soldier, and the other soldier

races for the belltower. As he does:

THE SANDINISTAS SEIZE THE MOMENT TO RUSH CLOSER, waving to

Pedro who slips along a wall with his bag of bombs.

PRICE STARTS TO FOLLOW BUT IS PINNED DOWN BY FIRE and chooses

to take refuge halfway in an alcove. As fire from both sides

ricochets all over the rooftop, Price switches camera lenses

seemingly oblivious to the action.

PEDRO MEETS ONE OF THE SANDINISTAS in a protected niche and

quickly they are unfolding his bag, setting the "muffin bombs"

out on the rooftop.

THE OTHER TWO SANDINISTAS OPEN HEAVY FIRE and briefly draw

heavier fire from the belltower, as:

PEDRO PICKS UP A MUFFIN weighing it briefly in his hand,

like a pitcher. He studies the surroundings -- runners on

first and third, no outs -- he spits in his left (his pitching

hand) and rubs it in casually.

Pedro crosses himself, goes into an abbreviated pitching

motion, then rears and fires the 'muffin' toward the belltower

window, exposing himself as he does.

AN EXPLOSION IN THE TOWER

PEDRO THROWS ANOTHER INTO THE TOWER -- another explosion.

A GUARDIA SOLDIER STAGGERS INTO THE WINDOW and a Sandinista

drops him with a shot.

All is quiet.

THE THREE SANDINISTAS CAREFULLY RUSH THE TOWER, looking in

and motion to Pedro and Price that all is okay, and as they

do:

ANOTHER SHOT RINGS OUT -- they whirl around -- Pedro and

Price drop again. A lone Guardia soldier fires at them from

the other tower.

A THIRD SANDINISTA DROPS HIM WITH A VOLLEY OF FIRE Again all

is quiet.

PRICE FOLLOWS THE SANDINISTAS TO THE FIRST BELLTOWER and

looks in.

FIVE BODIES LIE SCATTERED AND BLOODIED One of the Guerrillas

kicks a couple of them to make sure they are dead. In the

corner, one body lies on top of another. Satisfied, the

Sandinistas head for the other tower.

PRICE STAYS BEHIND TO TAKE A FEW PICTURES and the ever-present

light meter appears, followed by several quick shots of the

bodies. Then Price goes to one of the arched, stone windows.

He looks out over the city.

P.O.V. OF LEON -- DUSK Late in the afternoon now, the fighting

is over for the day. An occasional gunshot. Smoke rises from

scattered places throughout the city. There is new rubble.

The town is littered with bodies.

P.O.V. THE RED CROSS WAGON MOVING THROUGH THE STREET

A man walks in front of it, chanting slowly, rhythmically:

We see a woman drag a body out into the street. The Red Cross

man makes small stacks of bodies. He douses the bodies with

gasoline and sets the pile aflame. Then continues.

Price watches. He thinks he hears something, then dismisses

it. Something else. A voice, almost a whisper.

He turns. One of the bodies speaks.

Price looks out -- the Sandinistas are on the other side of

the roof. This war gets stranger.

A body rolls out from under another body. Blood-splattered,

smiling, wiping the blood from his face. It is Oates, the

mercenary from Africa. He peeks out the window -- the

Sandinistas are on the other side of the roof. He whispers.

For a moment they understand that they are there for the

same reason -- they make their livings off war. Oates peeks

out the window nervously and repeatedly.

OATES readies his automatic weapon in case it's needed --

routine. Price doesn't know how to answer.

Oates laughs quickly and softly -- he is tuned into the

strangeness of Price's answer.

P.O.V. THE SANDINISTAS HEADING BACK TOWARD US

OATES AND PRICE SEE THEM, and Oates crawls back under the

pile of bodies.

THE SANDINISTAS LOOK INTO THE BELLTOWER, all looks quiet,

and they motion to Price.

EXT. THE FRONT OF THE CATHEDRAL - DUSK

The Three Sandinistas, Pedro, and Price are hiding in the

shadows of the main church entrance. The Sandinistas are

carefully peeking around the corner, checking out the plaza.

It seems safe. The door opens; the Priest lets Claire out.

For a moment she looks around to see who's still alive -- in

the shadows Price looks like one of the Guerrillas. They see

each other and embrace briefly.

The Sandinistas seem to relax. The Sandinistas take pride in

Pedro and pat his left arm for Price and Claire.

They seem to want approval from the Americans.

The Sandinistas slap hands, familiar with the American

gesture. The Six start walking across the plaza away from

the church. In the b.g. we see piles of bodies burning; the

Red Cross tends to the wounded locals. Spirits are high as

they walk. The tiny red light glows on Claire's recorder.

All five of them agree that Pedro is the best; they slap his

valued arm and relax for the first time all day.

EXT. ROOFTOP OF THE CATHEDRAL - DUSK

OATES CHECKS THE CLIP ON HIS RIFLE and looks down into the

plaza.

OATES P.O.V. TO THE SIX WALKING AWAY He doesn't smile or

joke -- it's all business.

He aims the rifle.

EXT. THE PLAZA - DUSK

A SHOT RINGS OUT, AND PEDRO'S CHEST EXPLODES in front of us.

Sudden panic, rage, confusion -- the Sandinistas whirl and

scan the building.

P.O.V. OATES RACING ACROSS THE CATHEDRAL ROOFTOP into the

night.

PRICE GRABS PEDRO'S GUN AND WHIRLS to face the church; his

action is instinctive, angry, and electric with energy.

CLAIRE GRABS PEDRO'S ARM AND DRAGS THE BODY to safety, though

there is no safety and the body is lifeless. Her actions are

protective and automatic.

THE SANDINISTAS TAKE CONTROL OF THE SITUATION and move

quickly. Two of them fan out to cover the escape. Price

screams in the direction of Oates,

Claire drags the body near a bench under a tree.

The Sandinistas survey the cathedral and streets carefully,

warily, upset at their nonchalance. They know the sniper is

disappearing into the night, but they continue to look.

The Three Sandinistas fan out toward the church as it gets

dark.

PRICE AND CLAIRE STAND NEXT TO PEDRO, feeling helpless and

ineffective. They both look at the body. Price realizes he's

holding Pedro's gun and places it down next to the body.

Price notices the tiny red light is still glowing on her

tape recorder. He points it out to Claire. She turns it off.

INT. THE HOUSE OF HAMMOCKS - NIGHT

IN A NEARLY DARK ROOM full of hanging hammocks, Claire sits

on the floor lit by a low wattage bulb hanging from a cord.

In another room through a door Price can be seen with a family

in the hammock workshop. Claire talks softly into her

recorder.

As she speaks Price bids the family farewell and comes into

the room with Claire where he lies down in a hammock.

Claire lies down on a mat, exhausted, after turning out the

light. Several moments pass before Price speaks.

Silence.

Silence. They lie for a long time in the dark. A light in

the house is turned off. Finally:

Price gets out of the hammock and lies down next to her.

They don't speak. They kiss. She unbuttons his shirt. He

unbuttons her blouse. They undress just enough to begin making

love softly, quietly.

INT. PRICE AND CLAIRE'S ROOM - DAWN

The first light of dawn strikes Claire's bare torso.

PRICE'S LIGHT METER APPEARS AT HER BACK Price takes a reading,

then moves the meter to her neck, another reading. He moves

it down her nude body lit beautifully in the vague light,

partially covered with a blanket.

He scurries across the room, stark naked, with a camera.

Price begins photographing her.

He moves back to her and gently removes the blanket from the

rest of her body. His actions are quiet and easy. He stops

frequently to admire her.

Claire lies sleeping nude, except for her socks. Price moves

around the room -- picture, picture, picture.

CLAIRE WAKES UP SLOWLY and pulls the blanket back over her.

She opens her eyes and sees Price sitting in a chair several

feet away with his camera.

She realizes what he's been doing.

Her sense of violation is balanced by this notion. For a

moment we sense her attitude can go either way -- outrage or

some sense of being flattered, however ill conceived. She

chooses the latter.

Price hands her the film and climbs back under the blanket

with her.

They curl up together, holding onto each other. A small child

crosses the courtyard, peeking at them. A rooster crows.

The peacefulness is shaken by the roar of an engine close

by.

A HELICOPTER GUNSHIP PASSES OVER THE COURTYARD They look up,

jolted out of the moment. The war is back.

EXT. THE OUTSKIRTS OF LEON - MORNING

Price's rental car is a smoking wreck. He and Claire arrive

and she removes a single, feeble white flag that remains.

They study the car briefly and then turn as:

A GUARDIA TROOP CARRIER LUMBERS past with a truckload of

refugees behind. They wave the flag and catch a ride with

the refugees.

INT. FIFTH FLOOR OF INTERCONTINENTAL HOTEL - DAY

Alex comes out a door chatting with somebody, and passes a

mini-cam crew, old friends.

A small laugh. They continue on. Alex enters Claire's room.

INT. CLAIRE'S ROOM

Alex enters. Nobody there. As he turns to leave he sees some

pictures in a stack of papers on her desk. He picks one up.

CLOSE UP: A PICTURE OF CLAIRE SLEEPING IN LEON It's all over

and he knows it. He stares at, even admires, the image. He

puts it down and turns to leave as:

CLAIRE ENTERS

Alex finally acknowledges that it is over with Claire, but

refuses to say it directly.

Alex nods, then seems to hit the end of his own resilience

and gets vitriolic.

In a simple monologue Alex goes from outrage to acknowledgment

of what he already knew.

EXT. THE MANAGUA AIRPORT - NEXT DAY

A cab pulls up. Soldiers stand around everywhere. Price,

Claire, Alex, and the Cabbie get out. The cabbie takes his

bag.

Price pulls a bottle of wine from his camera bag and sets

three styrofoam cups on the cab roof. He hands the cork to

Alex and shows him the label.

Alex does, and looks at the label.

They toast and drink.

Awkward smile from Price.

Price makes the motion of taking a picture. They look at him

with affection, yet astounded again by his inappropriateness.

He wanders away from the car to give them a moment alone,

and as he does he pulls the light meter from his pocket,

flipping it on and off nervously without looking at it. He

wanders idly toward a Guardia soldier. The soldier gets

nervous.

Alex considers this -- he understands (whether he wants to

or not).

THE SOLDIER COMES FACE-TO-FACE with PRICE, WHO BACKS OFF

The soldier stops at Tacho's name. Price turns.

P.O.V. ALEX AND CLAIRE KISSING GOODBYE

PRICE TURNS AGAIN, embarrassed, faces the soldier.

The soldier, confused, turns away, and as he does:

ALEX SLAPS PRICE ON THE SHOULDER, AND THEY TOO EMBRACE

Alex is amused, Price is serious. The cabbie comes out and

Alex heads into the airport.

EXT. SOMOZA'S COMPOUND - A PRESS LUNCHEON - DAY

Daisy and her combo from the Viking Club perform "The Girl

From Ipanema" as ONE HUNDRED PRESS MEMBERS and V.I.P.'s sit

at long tables in the garden. The pleasantness of the

surroundings is countered by the presence of dozens of

SOLDIERS in the background, guarding the house, etc. Visible

at the head table are: TWO GENERALS AND THEIR WIVES, MRS.

SOMOZA, TWO WEALTHY BUSINESSMEN, MISS PANAMA IN A FLOPPY

HAT. Elsewhere mingling are: JAZY, ISELA, PRICE, REGIS. An

elaborate array of food sits on the table.

INT. SOMOZA'S HOUSE - DAY

Overlooking the gathering from his private living room, Somoza

grants Claire her interview. He close the window to muffle

the singing.

He takes her hand and leads her to two large portraits hanging

on a wall -- his parents.

Somoza just smiles unaffected by her questions; she knows

the game is undaunted.

EXT. THE LUNCHEON TABLES - DAY

Hub Kittle is bending Price's ear in the crowd. Price seems

ammused and watches the anthem contest as he munches food.

Price gives him a cigaret.

It's simple, and Hub is pleased with his presentation. A

SOLDIER moves through the crowd looking quite out of place,

finds Hub and hands him a note. Hub reads it, seems delighted,

and excuses himself from the table.

Price and Regis look at each other strangely -- what's he

talking about? They shrug, Regis bites into a papaya, and

Hub hurries inside. Price and Regis watch the singer.

INT. SECOND FLOOR OF SOMOZA'S HOUSE - DAY

Somoza ignores the question and reopens the window, flooding

the room with the Tony Bennett classic.

HUB KITTLE AND AN OFFICER BURST INTO THE ROOM interrupting

the interview. Something has happened. Somoza initially lashes

out at them -- the first time we've seen him lose his cool --

then recovers.

The OFFICER seems familiar with these tirades and grabs Somoza

by the arm, whispering into his ear. Somoza seems delighted

with the news and turns to Hub for confirmation. Hub nods.

As Somoza leaves the room with the Officer and Hub, Hub turns

to Claire to squeeze in one final P.R. stroke.

Claire is left alone momentarily in Somoza's room. A soldier

enters and accompanies her outside to the luncheon.

EXT. THE LUNCHEON - DAY

As Claire comes outside, there is a flurry of activity at

the head table. TWO OFFICERS hastily set up an easel with a

large military-topographical map of Nicaragua. A SOLDIER

takes the microphone from the Singers -- the music grinds to

an inglorious halt -- and carries it to the head table.

Price spots Claire and makes a "What's all this about?"

motion. Claire holds out her palms and shrugs -- she doesn't

know. All attention is quickly focused on the head table,

as:

PRESIDENT SOMOZA MAKES A GRAND ENTRANCE FLANKED by Hub Kittle

and an Officer. He seems suddenly in unusually good spirits.

Hub taps the mike -- it works -- he motions for Somoza to

come forward.

Somoza plays the moment with theatrical elan.

Somoza points to a spot on the map as do his Officer.

THE PRESS TABLE IS SHAKEN FROM ITS NONCHALANCE and several

journalists immediately leap to their feet to question him.

Somoza hands the mike to an aide who returns it to the music

stand. Almost immediately the music begins again.

AT THE PRESS TABLE there is some confusion over the

announcement. Some journalists hurry off to file the story,

others just sit. Price seems alarmed by the announcement,

confused. Slightly wired, he listens to Regis and OTHER

JOURNALIST discuss it.

CLAIRE TRIES TO CORNER HUB KITTLE who is heading back inside.

Hub disappears inside, Claire pressing after him.

JAZY APPROACHES PRICE and leans in as if sharing a confidence.

IN the b.g. the luncheon is breaking up.

Price throws his camera bag over his shoulder, pulls out a

camera, and follows Jazy. They walk toward the head table.

Mrs. Somoza and Miss Panama are waiting as Price and Jazy

arrive. Price is automatically switching camera lenses, but

he continues to grill Jazy.

Price and Jazy exchange glances as Somoza reluctantly joins

the portrait.

SOMOZA POSES WITH HIS WIFE AND HIS MISTRESS ON EACH ARM as

Price flashes a light meter under their noses, then backs

off to take the picture.

Price takes a picture, Somoza wants to leave and Jazy would

just as soon have this awkward moment over with, but:

Reluctantly they pose again, and Price grills Jazy who is

trapped.

Jazy moves Miss Panama slightly, returning to Price.

As Somoza holds an interminable pose, Jazy launches into a

speech, keeping his voice low enough so Tacho cannot hear.

Jazy and Price motion for the posers to move a step over.

Price smiles to Somoza, Mrs. Somoza, and Miss Panama. Somoza

hurries off from his uncomfortable position at last.

The two men share a smile.

EXT. THE ROAD TO MATAGLAPA - EARLY MORNING

A rental station wagon covered with press flags races along.

Inside the car are the British crew -- Regis drives -- and

Price and Claire.

EXT. MATAGALPA - DAY

A city of about 50,000 located on the side of a hill. The

car pulls slowly into the base of the town into a clearing

with assorted vehicles -- Red Cross, La Guardia, Press. The

car moves slowly as its occupants survey the town, until it

pulls alongside a Red Cross truck that has broken down. Price

sticks his head out the window to ask instructions of a R.C.

WORKER.

Regis and his crew don't like this at all. Price points.

P.O.V. A TOWER FULL OF GUARDIA SNIPERS

MAIN ROAD INTO MATAGALPA

A gradual uphill grade -- the press car moves slowly. Guardia

are on both sides of the street, as the car stops at the

corner, directly beneath the sniper tower. They all look up.

P.O.V. THE SNIPERS LOOKING BACK DOWN AT THEM

THE CAR SLOWLY TURNS LEFT

The car stops, the door opens, and:

A WALL NEARBY IS RIDDLED WITH BULLET HOLES AS THEY CLIMB

OUT, so they climb back in quickly.

P.O.V. A SOLDIER HOLDS OUT HIS ARMS AS IF TO SAY, "accident."

The soldier seems sincere, but they don't want to take a

chance.

THE CAR MOVES DEEPER INTO MATAGALPA, gradually moving among

tanquettas patrolling the streets, coming to a barricade

which they manuever past as Guardia soldiers look at them

strangely. The car turns around -- it has come too far.

A GUARDIA OFFICER SIGNALS FOR THEM TO GET OUT but the idea

doesn't appeal to Regis and he whirls around, panicking

slightly, and heads off in the other direction.

THE BARRICADE OFFICER SPEAKS IN A WALKIE TALKIE to a squadron

leader a couple of blocks away as the car approaches.

THE SECOND OFFICER WHISTLES FOR THE CAR TO STOP but it speeds

up.

THE OFFICER FIRES A PISTOL SHOT AT THE CAR SHATTERING THE

WINDSHIELD

INSIDE THE CAR -- VISION IS BADLY IMPAIRED BY THE SHATTERED

GLASS and Regis panics, hitting the floorboard and the car

suddenly screeches around a corner, racing through Matagalpa.

The car squeals around corner after corner blindly, into:

A GUARDIA BARRICADE AS A FUSILADE OF SMALL ARMS FIRE RINGS

OUT The windshield is totally destroyed now, and:

THE OCCUPANTS OF THE CAR CROUCH LOW as the car races. Price

and Claire scream at Regis to stop, but it's too late.

THE CAR SCREECHES INTO REVERSE as Regis tries to see out the

back window and Price, out of necessity operates the foot

pedal with his hand. The car smokes into an intersection and

sees:

AN OPEN BLOCK AHEAD -- no Guardia are visible, so the car

races down the open block and as it comes to an intersection:

A SHERMAN TANK COMES AROUND THE CORNER FACING US

Several times larger than a tanquetta -- it dwarfs us and

everything around it. Its giant gun faces us head on.

THE PRESS CAR SCREECHES TO A HALT, and everyone scrambles

out.

The mini-cam equipment is dropped as the British crew

scrambles to safety against a building. Price and Claire end

up on opposite sides of the street.

Silence -- the huge and silent tank is deciding what to do.

THE TURRET SWINGS SEVERAL DEGREES TO ONE SIDE and lowers as

the scattered journalists freeze.

A THUNDEROUS ROAR -- THE TANK DESTROYS THE CAMERA EQUIPMENT

leaving a huge crater and not a trace of the expensive qear.

CLAIRE STARTS LAUGHING, FRIGHTENED, nervous and amused.

PRICE TAKES PICTURES

A WOMAN THROWS A CONTACT BOMB FROM A WINDOW AT THE TANK The

tiny bomb makes a pitiful explosion, hopelessly ineffective.

THE TANK SWINGS ITS TURRET TOWARD THE HOUSE AND OPENS FIRE

and the wall of the house crumbles quickly as a family

scrambles to the rooftop of a neighboring house. Their house

is destroyed in a second.

LA GUARDIA TROOPS APPEAR AND BEGIN FIRING TOWARDS Claire and

Price, who turn to see:

SANDINISTA ARMY REGULARS RUNNING DOWN THE HILL alongside the

homemade local guerillas. This is the first time we've seen

the F.S.L.N. regular army in their camouflaged khaki dress.

THE GUARD TAKES A POSITION TO FIGHT IT OUT and Claire and

Price are caught in a cross-fire, pinned to walls on each

street side.

PRICE PUSHES THROUGH A DOOR TO SAFETY and looks back:

CLAIRE IS TRAPPED OUTSIDE pounding on a door that doesn't

open. She tries another -- no luck. She curls up in a doorway

making herself as small as possible as bullets rip the wall

around her.

AT THE TOP OF THE HILL, AN OLD BUS MOVES SLOWLY INTO THE

STREET

Several youthful guerillas are pushing it.

THE BUS COMES FLYING DOWN THE HILL TOWARD THE TANK Several

hundred feet away, it gathers speed toward us.

INT. THE SPEEDING BUS

A YOUTH at the wheel props a board under the steering wheel

and races to the back as ANOTHER YOUTH opens the door as the

bus races past Claire toward the tank.

THE TWO YOUTHS LEAP OUT THE BACK DOOR where they tumble into

the dirt just before:

THE BUS SMASHES INTO THE TANK AND EXPLODES

GUARDIA SOLDIERS SHOOT THE TWO YOUTHS before they get away,

as:

GUERILLAS APPEAR ON EVERY ROOFTOP opening heavy fire on La

Guardia.

GUARDIA TROOPS RETREAT QUICKLY ON FOOT AND IN TANQUETTAS

THE SHERMAN TANK TRIES TO DISLODGE ITSELF FROM THE BUS but

cannot, and drags the bus with it as it backs down the hill.

PRICE RUNS OUT TO CLAIRE and huddles with her. She is shaken

but unhurt.

SANDINISTAS ARE EVERYWHERE, moving into Matagalpa as Price

and Claire move past several bodies to higher ground.

SANDINISTA BARRICADES ARE ON EVERY CORNER where women serve

food to their men. Claire and Price wander through,

momentarily disoriented. A small boy runs through the street

kicking a soccer ball, occasionally avoiding a body. He runs

right up to them and speaks.

They follow him up a hill.

EXT. MIDDLE-CLASS HOUSE OVERLOOKING THE CITY - DAY

THE NEIGHBORHOOD IS TOTALLY SANDINISTA and several guerillas

are at the door. The boy speaks to one of the guards, and

they are admitted.

INT. THE HOUSE - DAY

THEY ARE SEARCHED IMMEDIATELY, asked to put down their gear,

asked for credentials, and led down the hallway of a house

that is very American middle class.

ANOTHER SOLDIER WITH RIFLE detains them momentarily before

showing them into a room used as a Revolutionary Command

office.

ISELA STANDS IN MILITARY FATIGUES talking to her Sandinista

colleagues. Clearly she commands respect and makes decisions.

She finishes and turns to Claire and Price in a very

businesslike way, never acknowledging directly that they

have met before.

They are somewhat taken aback at her directness and

information.

EXT. A MOUNTAIN ROAD - LATER - DAY

An old truck chugs up a series of cutbacks through rough

terrain. The truck has no hood, and a BOY sits on the fender

pouring oil from a series of Folgers cans into a funnel stuck

permanently into the engine. Underneath, dangling cans catch

the oil as it flows through. Price, Claire and FOUR ARMED

SANDINISTAS sit in the back. ISELA rides in front.

THE TRUCK PASSES THROUGH A FRIENDLY GUERILLA ROADBLOCK

EXT. TOBACCO FIELDS IN REMOTE TERRAIN - DAY

ISELA, CLAIRE, PRICE AND THE FOUR HIKE into increasingly

inaccessible terrain.

EXT. RAFAEL'S CAMP - DUSK

Heavily guarded but very mobile, the camp consists of perhaps

100 Soldiers, women preparing food, several tents. Price and

Claire attract attention as they enter.

PRICE STOPS AND LOOKS AROUND THE CAMP CLOSELY seeming to

take it all in. He's been in many similar camps, countries,

wars.

P.O.V. TWO SOLDIERS GUARDING THE ENTRANCE TO ONE TENT

Price doesn't answer but continues taking it all in, and

ISELA shouts to them to continue.

THEY CONTINUE INTO THE CAMP, BUT PRICE STOPS AGAIN Something

has caught him, his sixth sense, a feeling -- he refuses to

walk further for the moment. No glibness, just coolness.

Price looks around, speaks quietly.

Claire looks around quickly. There is no evidence to her.

They continue into the camp -- now Claire looks around

nervously. Price mutters a half laugh, softly and strangely,

as they are led to a makeshift table and offered food. In

the b.g. Isela enters one of the tents.

PRICE AND CLAIRE SIT DOWN TO EAT and Price continues scanning

the camp as they talk.

He doesn't know.

P.O.V. FOUR FIGURES/CONFERRING IN FRONT OF A TENT Isela

emerges and joins them. The others are: THE PRIEST FROM LEON,

A BUSINESSMAN WHOM WE SHOULD RECOGNIZE FROM EARLIER SCENES,

AND COMMANDANTE CINCO, dressed in camouflaged khaki.

ISELA WALKS OVER TO CLAIRE AND PRICE after talking with the

others. She brings COMMANDANTE CINCO with her. They sit down.

They all shake hands.

Isela begins at once.

THEY ALL RISE AND HEAD TOWARDS RAFAEL'S TENT

INT. RAFAEL'S TENT

The tent is filled with Sandinista officers and soldiers

standing and sitting around.

RAFAEL'S BODY LIES ON A TABLE The shirtless upper torso

propped slightly upright, still wearing glasses, the figure

of Rafael is distinctly non-heroic. He is slightly overweight,

slightly balding, but as he lies there surrounded by his

men, the the glow of lanterns, he looks almost alive.

Price and Claire look at each other.

Price laughs -- the request is ridiculous.

Cinco steps forward -- his presence commands attention. His

delivery is forceful but not emotional. As he begins to speak,

Price stops laughing.

He pauses briefly.

CINCO attacks that defense with new vigor.

PRICE hesitates, his manner devoid of its usual cockiness.

COMMANDANTE CINCO PLACES AN ARM ON PRICE'S SHOULDER and speaks

in broken English.

INT. PRICE AND CLAIRE'S TENT - LATER THAT NIGHT

Price lies on his back on a table. Claire sits in a chair, a

lantern is on the table. His reclining body is not unlike

Rafael's. He plays with a camera without looking at it,

turning it slowly, removing and replacing a lens. He's never

been this calm, this unmoving.

Claire, however, moves around the tent like a caged animal --

like Price normally is. She smokes. She's nervous and wired.

He nods slightly.

He fiddles with the cameras.

Silence.

Silence.

Silence. Claire lies down on the cot. Exhausted but high.

Price gets off the table and goes to her.

He gets on the cot with her. They kiss deeply, passionately,

and begin making love.

EXT. THE CAMP - FIRST LIGHT OF DAWN

THE CAMP IS COMING TO LIFE as the flap opens on Price's tent

and he looks out. He raises his camera and starts taking

pictures of:

A WOMAN COOKING OVER A FIRE AS A BUSINESSMAN LOOKS ON, a

face we recognize from earlier in Managua -- FREEZE FRAME

THREE YOUNG GUERRILLAS PLAYING WITH A DOG -- FREEZE FRAME

THE PRIEST FROM LEON DRINKING FROM A GOURD -- FREEZE FRAME

TWO CHILDREN PLAYING WITH HANDMADE TOYS -- FREEZE FRAME

ISELA COMING OUT OF ANOTHER TENT -- FREEZE FRAME

PRICE RISES AND LOOKS AROUND THE CAMP, wandering over to a

large can where he drinks some water.

CLAIRE EMERGES FROM THE TENT and watches Price head over to

a shaded area with his cameras.

CLAIRE'S P.O.V. OF PRICE AS HE MOVES THROUGH A GROUP OF

SANDINISTAS GATHERED AROUND A TABLE

Their backs are toward us as he adjusts seating positions

and rearranges items that have been provided for the table.

He takes a light reading and moves quickly into position.

Price raises his camera.

PRICE'S P.O.V. OF A TABLEAU OF RAFAEL, CINCO, AND SOLDIERS

They sit at a table studying a map, a copy of La Prensa is

displayed -- the headlines declare that RAFAEL IS DEAD and

featuring a photo of Somoza at the luncheon as he points to

a map of the country. For an instant Rafael looks alive --

FREEZE FRAME.

EXT. THE ROAD BLOCK TO MANAGUA - LATER

Price and Claire are sitting on top of a Red Cross truck as

it heads through Sebaco. Soldiers from La Guardia are

everywhere. As the truck moves through the village, something

catches Price's eyes:

OATES STANDS AGAINST A WALL IN COMMAND OF A SQUADRON Two

whores and several troops sit against a wall. As the truck

passes, Oates waves casually, with emotion.

INT. PRICE'S HOTEL BATHROOM IN MANAGUA - DAY

Red light in the bathroom as Price pulls several photo prints

from the bath and plasters them wet against the mirror.

PHOTO OF RAFAEL IN THE CAMP, and he looks very much alive.

He pulls more shots from the bath: THE PRIEST FROM LEON, THE

BUSINESSMAN, COMMANDANTE CINCO AND ISELA. He dries them off

and hides them with their negatives under a pile of equipment.

He picks up the shot of Rafael and leaves.

EXT. SOMEWHERE IN MANAGUA

A group of muchachos in masks, baseball caps, and bandanas

race through the streets carrying a photo blow-up of Rafael.

INT. JAZY'S HOUSE

The newspaper headline sits on Jazy's desk as Jazy studies

it unemotionally. We hear Miss Panama's voice:

He spins on his chair as she glides in modeling a new dress.

She spins magically for him -- he blows her a kiss.

EXT. LUSH RIVER VALLEY OF NICARAGUA - DAY

A small private plane flies through a canyon, dwarfed by the

spectacular landscape. Hub Kittle works the room.

INT. THE PLANE - DAY

Two MASKED GUERILLAS hold a gun to the head of a pilot. A

large sack is crammed into the tiny compartment with them.

EXT. A SMALL MOUNTAIN TOWN IN NICARAGUA - DAY

The plane flies in low over the town and suddenly:

THE SKY IS FILLED WITH LEAFLETS that flutter to the ground.

Townspeople, bewildered at first, pick up the papers to see:

CLOSE UP -- PRICE'S PHOTOGRAPH OF RAFAEL ALIVE

LOCAL RESIDENTS RAISE THEIR FISTS IN SALUTE to the plane as

it disappears into the mountains.

EXT. THE ROOFTOP GARDEN OF THE INTERCONTINENTAL - DAY

Journalists are gathered to watch the fighting which is now

on the outskirts of Managua. Price stands to the side casually

taking pictures of Journalists taking pictures of the war.

Hub Kittle floats around providing drinks and P.R.

P.O.V. A PUSH-PULL AIRPLANE MAKES BOMBING PASSES on the

capitol. Columns of smoke rise throughout the city.

REGIS MOVES HIS MINI-CAM CREW INTO POSITION AT THE RAIL

CLAIRE STANDS TO THE OTHER SIDE with binoculars watching.

She accepts a drink from Hub and speaks into her tape deck.

She fires down the drink and puts down the mike. She picks

up the binoculars again and, glancing below, is shocked:

P.O.V. BELOW -- ALEX GETS OUT OF A CAB WITH HIS SUITCASES

He starts into the hotel, glances up, and they see each other.

Price sees Alex at the same time. Alex waves to both of as

he heads into the hotel. Price and Claire look at each other.

Claire sits down at a table, stunned to see Alex. Price

commandeers a waiter and joins her with a fresh tray of

drinks.

Price joins her as other journalists jockey for position at

the railing. He is equally upset and confused.

ALEX COMES THROUGH THE DOOR with a couple journalists, sees

Price and Claire and comes over to join them. A polite kiss

on Claire's cheek, a handshake for Price. A moment of

awkwardness.

Unsure silence.

Alex enjoys the lunatic mixture of politics and popular

culture.

Claire and Price struggle to enjoy this supremely

uncomfortable moment. It's not easy to enter the game. Claire

attempts to change the subject.

No more games. Alex addresses Price with conviction.

Price's and Claire's hearts sink. They look at each other.

Alex, despite his reluctance to return to Nicaragua, seems

genuinely enthused about the possible story. Before Price or

Claire respond, Hub Kittle notices Alex and comes over with

a tray of drinks, extending genuine greetings to the Senior

Correspondent.

The fresh round of drinks are put on the table. The sound of

bombs ripping the capitol are the only thing we hear.

INT. CLAIRE'S ROOM - NIGHT

Claire and Price now have adjoining rooms. She is staring

out the window as he comes in. The mood is strained.

Silence. She's hitting home but he doesn't want to acknowledge

it.

There is something calculating in Price's tone, this is not

the fearless, boyish innocent anymore.

Claire is disturbed at this compounding of the lie.

Silence. They are co-conspirators and they know it.

EXT. ROAD TO MATAGALPA - NEXT DAY

Price's white flagged newly rented press car streaks along,

overtaking an ox cart. A guardia convoy is going the opposite

direction, back toward Managua. Alex looks out of the car

with interest--he hasn't been to the front line for several

wars.

A car is on fire by the side of the road. Price flies past;

Alex watches curiously. Several people stand around the car.

Alex isn't sure how to respond to this curious reply.

Price is nervous, wired, on edge.

Alex takes this calmly -- it's not exactly new information.

Alex looks at the passing scenery -- he's in no hurry.

There is something desperate in his voice.

EXT. A ROADBLOCK ON THE EDGE OF SEBACO - DAY

Price and Alex are ordered out of their car by a very

unfriendly Guardia soldier. He is ordered to put down his

camera bag. The hood and trunk are opened.

They are led to a shed by the roadside, A TIRE REPAIR SHOP,

where they sit down in an oily, dusty shack. They watch the

soldiers:

P.O.V. THE SOLDIERS TEARING UP THE RENTAL CAR, pulling off

door panels, looking for weapons.

PRICE AND ALEX JERK TO LIFE at the sound of screaming in the

distance. A volley of gunfire follows. Price moves quickly

into an adjoining shed and looks through a crack in the wall:

P.O.V. AN EXECUTION SQUAD IN A FIELD as several bodies are

being hauled away. Two soldiers reload their guns. PAN to a

figure moving behind a wall -- OATES.

PRICE HURRIES THROUGH THE SHACKS TOWARD THE EXECUTION WALL

as Alex calls to him and hurries after -- Price is single-

minded. As he moves through the shacks we hear another volley

of fire, and Price bursts into a clearing to see:

TWO TRUCKS BEING LOADED WITH BODIES AS OATES SUPERVISES.

PRICE STEPS INTO THE CLEARING -- FACE-TO-FACE WITH OATES.

They look at each other for several beats before anyone

speaks. Oates is slightly embarrassed.

Oates smiles half-way; Price looks around at the bodies.

Alex arrives and tries to pull Price back -- at the same

time he sees the bodies and is sickened at the sight.

A body is carried through and loaded on a truck. Oates's

tone is one of explanation rather than defense, very matter-

of-fact.

Price mumbles and wanders to the next truck a few feet away,

and as he sees it he stops short, speechless. He points:

THE BODIES OF THE PRIEST FROM LEON AND THE BUSINESSMAN,

figures we saw at Rafael's camp, sit in the back of the truck.

They are splattered with blood and lifeless. Price is shaken.

Oates has to look to see who he's talking about, and Price

loses his cool.

PRICE GRABS OATES AND PUSHES HIM BACKWARDS but Oates responds

like an animal. The two men go down in a heap and lash out

at each other in the dust. Their fighting is largely

ineffective, though very physical, until Oates asserts himself

and knocks Price against a wall, breaking free to pick up

his automatic rifle that he handles with one hand and shoves

it into Price's face.

He leads them under an awning nearby where a couple soldiers

sit. A small table, some weapons, two shallow boxes, food,

beer. Oates rummages around to find what he wants, and pulls

out:

A HANDFUL OF PHOTOGRAPHS, mostly snapshots, odd sizes, with

names written on them. He sifts through them quickly and we

see an assortment of photographs of Nicaraguans. He finds

what he's looking for and holds up:

PRICE'S PHOTOGRAPH OF THE PRIEST AND THE BUSINESSMAN, the

picture taken in Rafael's camp, blown up, cropped, and

identified. The faces are circled.

This information hits Price in the gut, and he is seized

with fear.

Price turns, he doesn't want to face it.

Oates pulls another picture from a different box and holds

it up:

PHOTOGRAPH OF ISELA

Alex grabs Price and heads back toward the roadblock.

INT. THE CAR - DAY

Price hangs a U-turn at the roadblock and heads back to

Managua. He drives crazily.

Silence.

Silence. The car races.

Alex doesn't force the issue, nor does he understand it

entirely.

No answer -- the car races back to Managua. Alex stares at

Price trying to figure out what is wrong.

INT. PRICE'S ROOM AT THE INTERCONTINENTAL HOTEL - LATER

A MAID IS CLEANING HIS ROOM which is the usual disaster.

Price enters, just returned, and quickly looks for his

negatives under the equipment where he had hidden them.

The maid shrugs -- Price is crazy anyway, and:

CLAIRE WALKS INTO THE ROOM She too looks shaken. He looks

up.

The maid starts crying. They look at her helplessly as she

sobs, 'Cinco, Cinco...'

EXT. STREETS OF MANAGUA - DAY

A cab takes them through the increasingly nervous city. La

Guardia troop trucks are everywhere -- things seem more

hurried. A hunting rifle sits in the cabbie's lap. They get

out and knock on Jazy's door.

GUARDIA SOLDIERS WATCH THEM FROM A DISTANCE, a development

that Price and Claire are aware of.

Still no answer.

Price is impatient. He looks around nervously -- the Guards

are out of view -- and he slides a knife into the latch,

jimmying the lock. The door opens slowly -- an alarm goes

off.

Price and Claire duck inside quickly.

Price, momentarily comfortable with the danger, responds

quickly and finds the alarm wire running along the door jamb.

LA GUARDIA TROOPS NEARBY HEAR THE ALARM and head toward

Jazy's.

INSIDE THE HOUSE PRICE FINDS THE ALARM BOX which he pries

open and expertly pulls two wires. The alarm stops.

Immediately they begin going through drawers and cupboards.

She pulls out some harmless snapshots of Miss Panama, replaces

them.

They find nothing downstairs. The look up at the sound of

distant gunfire.

Suddenly: Loud banging at the front door -- La Guardia.

EXT. TWO GUARDIA SOLDIERS AND A THIRD ARRIVING - DAY

They look around warily, hungrily -- they know something is

wrong.

BACK INSIDE THE HOUSE we hear the shouting soldiers, banging.

Price and Claire look at each other, and the camera bag.

Claire points upstairs to Price, to the door for herself.

Russell grabs the bag and bounds quickly upstairs. Claire

goes to the front door, shaking nervously.

CLAIRE OPENS THE DOOR AND FACES THE SOLDIERS

The soldiers look at each other curiously and push open the

door to look in the house without entering -- respectful of

Jazy.

The soldiers laugh and peer into the room. Claire forces the

door closed on them, teasing slightly.

Afraid to make a mistake with one of Jazy's sweethearts,

they don't press the issue. The door closes shut.

INT. THE HOUSE

CLAIRE sighs with frightened relief and hurries upstairs to

join Price.

JAZY'S BEDROOM as she enters. A rumpled bed, a spilled wine

glass -- a pleasant mess.

A door off the bedroom is open -- light spills out. Claire

stops cold at what she sees:

PRICE STANDS IN A ROOM FULL OF PHOTOGRAPHS Hundreds of

pictures of all sizes, photographic equipment, an enlarger,

cameras and lenses, etc. Pictures of Sandino, newspaper

photos, snapshots.

P.O.V. OF RUSSELL'S PHOTOGRAPHS FROM RAFAEL'S CAMP cropped

and blown up -- Commandante Cinco, the Priest of Leon, the

Businessman, Isela. Photographs of other slain rebel leaders.

The pictures include faces that have been circled with names

written in -- exactly as in the pictures Oates possessed.

They are both stunned.

THEY HURRY DOWNSTAIRS and as they get to the front door --

the sound of somebody opening it. They freeze.

THE DOOR OPENS AND MISS PANAMA ENTERS She smiles and greets

them in a friendly, aloof manner, and continues toward the

waterless pool.

Price and Claire return the greeting and continue out the

door.

EXT. JAZY'S HOUSE - THE SOUND OF MORTAR IN THE DISTANCE

As they emerge, Claire tears a white cloth in half and ties

it to a stick, handing half to Price who does likewise.

An earth mover goes past, a Guardia soldier at the wheel.

More soldiers cling to the machine, their guns at the ready.

They start walking.

Flags held high, they move nervously down the street into

the ominous silence of the city.

EXT. STREETS OF MANAGUA - NIGHT

Alex, Price, and Claire get out of a cab and approach a large

statue of Somoza on horseback, surreally lit by floodlights

in the center of a traffic circle. Four Guardia Soldiers are

visible on the sidewalk in the b.g. drinking with two women.

Silence. Alex knows Price too well -- it's a great story but

that's not why they're here.

Silence. Claire addresses Alex calmly.

Silence. Alex isn't quite sure he understood.

Silence. A bit of gallows laughter from Alex as he circles

the statue. Price calms and tries to explain.

Alex lets it all sink in. These two people about whom he has

such passionate feelings have totally exposed themselves to

him.

They don't respond -- he's right.

Small, tired gallows laughter from Alex. There is a long

silence before Alex speaks, aware of the irony.

Alex is surprised slightly, but takes pleasure in revealing

it.

Price and Claire exchange glances. Alex is dead serious.

INT. CLAIRE'S ROOM - NIGHT

PRICE AND CLAIRE LIE IN BED sweating. A siren and distant

mortar can be heard outside. Price goes to the window and

shuts it -- the room is quieter and hotter. He pounds a broken

air conditioning duct.

He looks out the window -- it never used to be this

complicated.

Silence.

She goes to him, lies down, and they embrace.

A loud, long burst of automatic weapons fire is heard

somewhere outside. Their eyes are open as they hold onto

each other.

EXT. THE STREETS OF MANAGUA - NEXT MORNING

A sense of foreboding. Heavy road equipment prowls the street

looking for Rebel barricades to destroy. Tanquettas and

Guardia everywhere.

The flag draped press car of Price and Alex drives slowly.

P.O.V. OUT OF THE CAR AS THEY LOOK CAREFULLY Things feel

wrong. Guardia barricades are everywhere, forcing them to

follow a route they might not choose. The Guardia soldiers

at the barricades seem on edge. When Jazy's house is visible

in the distance, barricades force them another direction.

GUARDIA SOLDIERS RACE DOWN A STREET TOWARD GUNFIRE and the

car stops. When the road is clear it creeps into an

intersection. They check their position.

THE CAR CREEPS TO A STOP and they look around further.

A PIG CROSSES THE STREET 100 YARDS AWAY AND IS SHOT BY A

SOLDIER.

Everything is wrong. Price looks around restlessly.

A WOMAN PEEKS OUT OF A DOORWAY WATCHING

But Alex is out of the car at once, approaching the woman.

Alex motions that "it's not necessary" and talks to the woman.

We can't hear, but she points down the block.

INSIDE THE CAR Price cranks film into place, his actions are

automatic and nervous. When he looks up:

P.O.V. ALEX FIFTY YARDS AWAY

Walking in the direction she pointed, he motions to Price as

if to say, "Just checking this out."

PRICE LOOKS AROUND NERVOUSLY FOR A SENSE OF DIRECTION And as

he does, looks through the camera.

THROUGH CAMERA P.O.V. OF THE DEAD PIG followed by quick

blurred pans to other images -- TANK, HOUSE, WOMAN, SOLDIER --

until it settles on ALEX IN THE INTERSECTION. Two Guardia

soldiers come up to him and he holds out his hands as if to

say, "I'm lost."

ALEX TALKS TO THE SOLDIERS -- FREEZE FRAME click, click --

and the whirring sound of a motor drive, another FREEZE FRAME

click, click, more whirring -- Price is on automatic pilot.

Another soldier orders Alex up against a wall.

Nobody sees Price taking pictures -- it happens too quickly.

THROUGH CAMERA P.O.V. ALEX IS SHOT IN THE CHEST FROM POINT

BLANK RANGE -- FREEZE FRAMES click, click, whirring as the

images blur and the camera is dropped.

PRICE STARES WITHOUT THE CAMERA

P.O.V. ALEX LIES DEAD AS THE SOLDIERS LOOK AROUND The act

was random, almost nonchalant.

PRICE STARTS TO RUN TOWARD ALEX shouting madly.

He stops quickly as they see him, realizing how exposed he

is.

THE GUARDIA START FIRING AT HIM, realizing the murder was

recorded.

PRICE LEAPS IN HIS CAR and starts it up, racing around the

corner as bullets rip into the car.

THE WINDOW SHATTERS, AND PRICE IS HIT IN THE SHOULDER He

clutches his bleeding arm as he races on.

EXT. SHANTYTOWN BARRIO - DAY

THE CAR GRINDS TO A HALT and Price leaps from it, racing

into a maze of ramshackle huts.

INT. SOMOZA'S BUNKER

A hastily called press conference. Tacho takes a quick drag

on a cigarette and makes the announcement.

A shock wave goes through the room -- hands raised, questions.

Somoza turns and leaves as Kittle passes out press statements.

INT. CLAIRE'S HOTEL ROOM

TV is on. She's at the typewriter working on a story.

A PHOTOGRAPH OF ALEX COMES ON THE TELEVISION NEWS, with

Spanish language commentary over the image.

CLAIRE KEEPS WORKING AND GRADUALLY TYPES LESS AS SHE HEARS

the story, finally rising and moving in front of the

television as a local newsman reads of Alex's death and we

see the Somoza press announcement.

The phone rings: Claire picks up the phone and listens

silently before hanging up. She sits down shakily on the bed

and starts crying.

EXT. THE SHANTYTOWN BARRIO - DAY

PRICE HURRIES THROUGH the passageways between tin shacks,

through tiny yards of goats and chickens, through houses as

poor that the war has nearly passed them by. Price is hurting,

and looks around with fear to see:

THE GUARDIA SOLDIERS MOVE DOWN INTO THE SHANTYTOWN, fanning

out to quickly engulf the barrio. They move quickly.

A HELICOPTER GUNSHIP MOVES IN LOW over the barrio and opens

up sporadic outbursts of fire to insure nobody will try to

flee.

PRICE RUNS DOWN AN ALLEY and nearly runs right into the

Guardia. He hides behind a paper thin wall of flattened beer

cans -- the Guardia move past him only inches away. Price

starts off in another direction, but Guardia appear -- he is

trapped in the barrio.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY

Journalists are everywhere -- suitcases packed -- trying to

get out of the country. The registration desk is chaos. Regis

tries to get the attention of the clerk -- so does everyone

else.

The clerk is under attack.

CLAIRE GETS OFF THE ELEVATOR AND MOVES THROUGH THIS CHAOS

Regis sees her and tries to give her comfort -- she's beyond

that. She wears a jacket and carries her bag -- she's going

somewhere.

She pushes him away politely; she is single-minded now.

Regis looks at her like she's crazy.

Hub Kittle enters the lobby, sees Claire and volunteers:

Claire is nearly in tears, but resists.

CLAIRE EXITS THE HOTEL AND GETS INTO HER PRESS CAR

EXT. STREETS OF MANAGUA - LONG SHOT OF JAZY'S HOUSE - DAY

Claire stays in her car and watches the house -- no way to

get close -- and she continues driving, her route dictated

by the same barricades that directed Alex and Price.

She passes the dead pig in the street, and TWO RED CROSS

WORKERS make their way slowly around a corner, frightened.

Claire gets out of her car and approaches them.

They all point down a street. She shows them the polaroid of

Price and her.

They haven't and continue on their way. Claire walks in the

direction they pointed -- no street fighting but many Guardia.

P.O.V. PRICE'S CAR FAR DOWN THE STREET SURROUNDED BY GUARDIA

EXT. SHANTYTOWN - DAY

PRICE HUNCHES DOWN AND CRAWLS BEHIND THE STALLS as soldiers

move through the yards looking for him.

A WOMAN IN A DOORWAY WATCHES PRICE HIDE

THE WOMAN APPEARS IN A DOORWAY AND MOTIONS WITH HER HEAD for

Price to dart inside.

INT. THE HOUSE - DAY

Nothing is said. Price is led into a room, one of many --

but this room is boarded over. There is no escape. Price is

in pain, his arm bleeds, he's tiring.

PRICE STANDS IN THE TINY ROOM WAITING

He leans against the wall behind the door. He shuts his eyes --

a noise at the door. When he opens them:

THE WOMAN IS STANDING THERE WITH A GUN

She hands it to him and leaves, bolting the door.

PRICE LEANS AGAINST THE WALL HOLDING A REVOLVER and he waits --

cameras around his neck, gun in hand, bloody, slightly

ridiculous, and scared.

EXT. THE STREETS OF MANAGUA - DAY

Price's shot up car is not far away, but she's afraid to

approach it. She shows the picture of Price to a small boy

who doesn't recognize it.

GUARDIA SOLDIER SPOTS CLAIRE and walks toward her. She cannot

tell if the act is routine or threatening. He calls out to

her.

She hesitates -- Alex is dead, everything is crazy. She starts

toward him, then changes her mind, turns, and walks quickly

away from him.

THE SOLDIER RUNS TOWARD HER

CLAIRE RUNS FASTER and darts into a narrow passageway behind

a house, where she looks back. He calls for support -- several

join him and hurry after her. Panicky, she runs between

houses.

OVERHEAD PLANES BUZZ THE NEIGHBORHOOD as Claire emerges from

the 'maze' to see:

P.O.V. PRICE'S CAR ABANDONED and full of holes near the shanty

town. Guardia are everywhere. The helicopter gunship is

overhead.

INT. THE HOUSE WHERE PRICE HIDES - DAY

He hears the Guard breaking in, and he cocks his gun.

INT. SAME HOUSE

as the Squadron Leader and three soldiers burst in -- the

woman stands in the middle of the room and lies.

The Sqaudron Leader points to different rooms for each

soldier, and they proceed to kick in each door, automatic

rifles ready.

PRICE'S ROOM AS HE HEARS A SOLDIER AT THIS DOOR.

THE DOOR IS KICKED OPEN, AND A SOLDIER STEPS INTO THE ROOM

For a moment he doesn't see Price -- then he whirls and faces

the photographer who's so scared he's forgotten to raise his

gun.

PRICE AND THE SOLDIER ARE FACE-TO-FACE The soldier is a

fourteen-year-old boy fighting back tears. He, too, is scared

to death. Neither is quite sure why he is there -- they just

want it to end.

PRICE AND THE BOY AIM THEIR GUNS AT EACH OTHER as they hear

the voice of the Squadron Leader in the other room.

No answer.

SQUADRON LEADER HEADS TOWARD THE ROOM but as he does, the

boy soldier appears in the doorway.

The Leader grunts an order, and the squadron quickly heads

to the next house.

PRICE'S BODY SLUMPS AGAINST THE WALL EXHAUSTED, and the woman

enters as soon as the last soldier has gone.

Price's brief moment of peace is shattered by the screaming

of Guardia troops and the explosions of rocket fire from the

gunship. He looks outside.

THE GUNSHIP FIRES INTO THE SHANTYTOWN killing several of its

own Guardia troops. A GUARDIA OFFICER screams at the gunship

and fires a hand gun at the giant chopper.

GUARDIA TROOPS EVACUATE THE SHANTYTOWN in a panicky scramble

to escape their own gunship.

PRICE RACES THROUGH THE BACK OF THE SHANTYTOWN, taking

advantage of the chaos, and without slowing down, breaks

free of the maze of the barrio.

CLAIRE'S P.O.V. OF PRICE RACING ACROSS THE STREET, past a

body and an overturned, smoking car, back into the rubble

strewn blocks of the edge of the city. A tanquetta comes

around a corner and sees Price a block away.

PRICE SEES HER, and races along a wall until they meet,

grabbing her on the run -- each is panicky and frightened --

and they duck into very shallow cover, barely safe.

They embrace quickly and tightly, but look around nervously

as they do. Price isn't sure if anybody knows about Alex.

P.O.V. A TANQUETTA PASSES ON THE NEXT STREET, visible through

shattered holes in the buildings. A Guardia squadron passes.

PRICE AND CLAIRE RUN DOWN THE STREET in the opposite

direction, their path guided somewhat by an overturned bus

in an intersection, abandoned barricades and roadblocks, and

the rubble of street fighting.

EXT. THE STREET OF JAZY'S HOUSE - DAY

PRICE AND CLAIRE hesitate at the corner and move slowly along,

seeing two Sandinistas, dressed half in camouflaged gear,

half disco. The TWO GUERRILLAS seem to control the street.

Price and Claire approach warily.

The Sandinista looks at his comrade, then looks around

nervously, frightened, then shrugs.

Price and Claire continue on down the street and

simultaneously noticed something strange:

THE DOOR TO JAZY'S HOUSE IS WIDE OPEN They approach carefully

and look in a view to the court-yard. Claire sticks her head

in the door slowly, and as she does:

A GIANT HAND GUN IS STUCK IN HER TEMPLE as TWO MUCHACHOS

quickly seize her and Price, dragging them inside.

INT. JAZY'S COURTYARD - LATE IN DAY

JAZY STANDS WITH A THIRD GUN AT HIS HEAD, being held by the

most forceful and crazed of three young Muchachos. With guns

on Jazy, Price, and Claire, there is much confusion as to

who's in charge and what exactly they're doing.

The guns are aimed back and forth in confusion -- Price and

Claire don't have a chance to respond, and they're not sure

what to say.

The Muchachos begin arguing rapidly among themselves; and as

they do, Jazy addresses Price and Claire coolly.

He is not begging for his life as much as for them to calm

down.

The Muchachos don't understand what he's saying, but they

stop to listen to his style. The guns remained trained on

all three.

Jazy turns to the boy who jams the gun into his head and

speaks with tired authority.

The Muchachos are immediately surprised and delighted, and

one of them speaks in excited, broken English.

The Muchachos quickly withdraw their guns from Price and

Claire and aim them all at Jazy's head.

CLAIRE TURNS AND WALKS AWAY, her back to the scene.

PRICE REMAINS AND STARES AT JAZY as the Muchachos grow

increasingly impatient. Some part of him wants to take the

picture.

PRICE TURNS AND WALKS AWAY toward Claire. Still -- Jazy talks.

A GUNSHOT RINGS OUT.

Price grimaces. Claire shuts her eyes. They turn to look at

the fallen Jazy as the Three Muchachos, frightened by their

own act, race back into the street. For several moments Price

and Claire stand, frozen, until the rumbling sound of a

helicopter gunship nearby forces them to hurry outside.

PRICE AND CLAIRE GO TO THE DOORWAY and look out as a jeep

full of Guardia screams past

P.O.V. SEVERAL GUERRILLAS RETREATING FROM AN ADVANCING

TANQUETTA a block away. The neighborhood seems to be changing

hands again.

Price and Claire slump in the darkness near the doorway; she

touches near his wounded arm.

She shakes her head and leans it against Price's shoulder

but the distant popping of guns does not even allow her a

moment of mourning. Their heads pop up nervously.

Silence.

Price doesn't want her to go alone, but he's not that excited

about hiding out in the middle of the city either.

He knows she's right. He loves her, and he's made enough

disastrous decisions lately. He hesitates, then pops open

his camera and removes the film. Price ties the film into

the white flag that hangs from a stick stuck into her belt.

PRICE AND CLAIRE EMBRACE AND KISS BRIEFLY

They kiss, and Claire runs out after a Red Cross truck. Price

watches nervously until they turn a corner, out of sight,

then goes back inside Jazy's courtyard. PRICE NEARLY STUMBLES

OVER JAZY'S BODY, stops, stares -- he'd forgotten already.

The body makes him uneasy, and after several moments he finds

a sheet and covers Jazy. Price then sits down and waits

nervously, sharing the courtyard with Jazy.

EXT. STREETS OF MANAGUA - DUSK

CLAIRE WALKS ALONGSIDE THE RED CROSS TRUCK as it comes around

a corner. The truck turns one direction, she wants to go the

other way toward the hotel.

P.O.V. -- THE INTERCONTINENTAL HOTEL ON THE HILL IN DISTANCE -

DUSK

Guardia troops heavily patrol the ground between Claire and

the hotel -- a jeep, a troop carrier, a tanquetta, and fifty

foot soldiers.

CLAIRE TAKES TEMPORARY COVER offered by a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN

who sees that she is afraid of La Guardia. Claire steps behind

a walled yard. Moments later:

A BOY ON A BIKE RIDES SLOWLY OUT OF THE YARD and turns up

the hill toward the Guardia and the hotel. Claire's white

flag is tied to his handlebars.

CLAIRE WATCHES FEARFULLY as the boy pedals into the military

zone. The woman offers Claire some food; she declines.

EXT. THE ROAD TO THE INTERCONTINENTAL HOTEL - DUSK

THE BOY PEDALS slowly, in no hurry, past La Guardia troops.

Some of them watch him curiously, some ignore him. The white

flag flutters as he rides.

EXT. STREETS OF MANAGUA - DUSK

CLAIRE RETRACES HER STEPS to the block where Price is hiding

in Jazy's house.

THE TWO DISCO SANDINISTAS LIE DEAD IN THE STREET, a dog sniffs

at the bodies. Claire looks around -- there is little sign

of life. She enters Jazy's house.

INT. JAZY'S HOUSE - DUSK

CLAIRE ENTERS and stops. She calls out his name, no answer.

Price is gone. She hurries back outside.

EXT. JAZY'S HOUSE - DUSK

TWO GUARDIA TROOP CARRIERS RACE PAST, sirens screaming, loaded

with Guardia soldiers. Claire steps into the street unsurely,

looking every direction.

PEOPLE BEGIN COMING OUT OF THEIR HOMES and what remains of

their small homes. They come one at a time at first, then in

small groups, carrying belongings, pets, chickens, etc.

CLAIRE SHOWS A PICTURE OF PRICE AND HER to a woman who comes

out of the house next to Jazy's, but the woman shakes her

head, not recognizing Price.

A PUSH-PULL PLANE DIVES IN LOW FIRING ROCKETS at the homes.

THE CROWD GROWS and chaotically flees the destruction,

gradually finding a direction out of the city. Claire is

swept along in the crowds, at first without choice, then

finally fleeing for her life with the rest of Managua. As

she moves with the crowd, she looks for Price everywhere,

without success.

EXT. A TEMPORARY REFUGEE CAMP - NIGHT

SEVERAL CAMPFIRES burn near the edge of the city where dozens

have taken temporary refuge. Claire arrives to see: A BODY

ON A STRETCHER BEING CARRIED up outside stairs to a rooftop

from which glow several bare bulbs. She goes up the stairs

to the rooftop.

EXT. A ROOFTOP HOSPITAL - NIGHT

A MAKESHIFT MOBILE HOSPITAL under awnings and palm fronds,

capable of moving location in minutes. A WOMAN DOCTOR and

two temporary orderlies tend to wounded. A small black and

white television sits on a table and those who are able watch

the seige of Managua on television while it goes on around

them. Claire looks for Price among the dead or wounded.

P.O.V. -- THE CITY UNDER ATTACK

Claire watches for several moments -- smoke, flame, the

buzzing sound of planes swooping low, fleeing crowds. She

then notices the television.

PRICE'S FOOTAGE OF ALEX'S DEATH comes on the TV screen, and

she pushes closer to see the grim sequence. The NEWS

COMMENTATOR explains in Spanish what we see CLAIRE IS SO

DISTURBED AT THE IMAGES that she turns away, sickened, hurt,

guilty, outraged, but unable to break down. She closes her

eyes -- her face is covered with tears. The Doctor notices

this and speaks softly to her.

It takes a while for Claire to respond.

Noise in the distance from mortars. The Doctor speaks calmly,

without bitterness in the voice, but with total conviction.

Claire acknowledges the grim truth of the observation with a

slight nod, and walks to the railing as:

ALEX'S DEATH IS REPEATED IN FREEZE FRAME SEQUENCE over and

over again as the Orderlies, Doctor, and patients gather to

watch with fascination.

CLAIRE STARES OUT AT THE CITY ON FIRE, when her eye catches

something -- a light in the sky. She watches:

P.O.V. -- A HELICOPTER WITH SEARCHLIGHT PASSES OVERHEAD,

momentarily illuminating the hospital, but it continues on,

curiously uninterested in the Guerrilla activity. The chopper

sweeps above a nearby hill and hovers, then slowly lowers to

earth.

CLAIRE WATCHES with interest then descends the stairs.

EXT. THE CEMETERY - NIGHT

SOMOZA WATCHES AS A BACK HOE DIGS UP THE COFFINS of his

parents. An Army helicopter lands, lighting the scene, and

Miss Panama rushes from the chopper into his arms as the

turbulence from the blades raises her dress and musses his

hair. Soldiers place the dirt-covered caskets on the roofs

of Somoza's two Mercedes, hastily tie them down, and the

strange motorcade, flanked by two heavily armed jeeps, drives

off into the dark.

CLAIRE WATCHES IT ALL from a safe distance, not far from the

refugee camp. She turns and walks slowly back to the camp.

EXT. THE REFUGEE CAMP - LATE AT NIGHT

Claire sits down against the remains of a wall. The war has

overtaken her -- she doesn't know if Price is alive -- and

though totally involved, she is at last an observer once

again. Claire notices the tiny red light of her recorder is

still on. She turns it off, and as the sounds of battle

gradually die down, Claire falls asleep -- exhausted.

EXT. THE REFUGEE CAMP - DAWN

CLAIRE SLEEPS AGAINST THE WALL as a dog sniffs and licks her

face. She awakens with a start -- the dog scurries away.

Claire rises and looks around.

A LOCAL WOMAN PUSHES A CART carrying the wrapped body of her

husband through the otherwise quiet streets of Managua.

CLAIRE MOVES THROUGH THE CAMP just coming to life, and looks

around trying to interpret the eerie silence. A WOMAN tends

to her TWO SMALL CHILDREN.

A DISTANT, DRONING NOISE GETS STEADILY LOUDER. Claire looks

around nervously.

A CHILD RUNS DOWN THE STREET SHOUTING

P.O.V. -- SEVERAL TANQUETTAS AND EARTH MOVERS coming over

the hill in the distance. The Refugees look up fearfully and

some hide. As the war machinery gets closer, we see that:

SANDINISTAS ARE DRIVING THE MACHINES draped with red and

black (F.S.L.N.), blue and white (Nicaraguan), and yellow

and white (the Vatican) flags. Graffiti of victory covers

the tanquettas.

PEOPLE COME INTO THE STREET CHEERING, embracing, only

gradually realizing what has happened.

The woman continues with her children, her comment

unemotional, and Claire smiles slightly and walks away,

through a city awakening slowly to its victory.

CLAIRE STOPS A RED CROSS TRUCK and shows the driver her

picture of Price. The picture means nothing to the driver.

Claire continues through the city, looking for Price.

EXT. THE INTERCONTINENTAL HOTEL - MORNING

CLAIRE WALKS INTO THE POOL AREA where chairs and tables float

in the pool, the bar is overturned, and the once sumptuous

press oasis is a disaster.

INT. THE INTERCONTINENTAL HOTEL - MORNING

CLAIRE ENTERS A DESERTED LOBBY, also a mess, and hesitates

before climbing the circular stairs.

CLAIRE LOOKS INTO PRICE'S ROOM, and finds it empty, and

typically messy.

CLAIRE WALKS INTO HER OWN ROOM -- PRICE STANDS AT THE BALCONY

looking out at the jubilant city from which smoke still rises.

CLAIRE AND PRICE EMBRACE DEEPLY, holding onto each other

without the slightest intention of letting go.

INT. THE INTERCONTINENTAL LOBBY - LATER - DAY

PRICE AND CLAIRE COME DOWNSTAIRS to the lobby. They are

cleaned up in fresh clothes; they have survived and the war

is over.

THE LOBBY IS COMING TO LIFE AGAIN with Regis' camera crew,

who look like they've had a long night, a BUS BOY, A MAID,

AN OLD COUPLE, and A WHITE WOMAN, 38, with TWO SMALL DAUGHTERS --

all either sit or mill in the b.g.

PRICE AND CLAIRE STOP SHORT at what they see.

P.O.V. -- A HANDMADE CASKET SITTING IN THE LOBBY with the

name, "A. Grazier" scrawled in felt pen.

Price and Claire stand next to the box silently -- there is

nothing to say -- but the silence is interrupted by a familiar

voice that is polite, unforced, and sincere.

Awkward silence until they realize that he's sincere.

We see the woman and little girls as Hub's family.

A shared silence at the lunacy of the moment, interrupted by

the tired voice of one of Hub's daughters.

Hub goes over to take care of his family.

EXT. PLAZA OF MANAGUA'S LARGEST CATHEDRAL - LATER - DAY

Thousands of people have gathered to celebrate in loud and

joyous singing, led by a group on the highest cathedral steps,

surrounded by Revolutionary leaders waving to the crowds. A

SINGING GROUP sings a song to Nicaragua, and a song to Rafael.

RAFAEL'S BODY IN A FANCY CASKET is carried in through the

crowd to wild cheering and singing. High over the pallbearers'

heads it moves through the crowds.

PRICE AND CLAIRE STAND TO THE SIDE watching it all. The

celebration is joyously infectious, and for the moment we

can forget the bloodshed, forget the problems that lay ahead,

forget even the death of Alex.

PRICE PULLS OUT A CAMERA and begins taking pictures of the

celebration.

ISELA IS AT THE MICROPHONE with other Guerrilla leaders.

CLAIRE WORKS THROUGH THE CROWD with her mike held high,

recording the singing of the crowd.

PRICE BACKS UNDER THE AWNING of a stand selling refreshments,

and especially Rum and Coke mixtures known suddenly and

triumphantly as "Nicalibres." As Price snaps off pictures --

a voice from an American in casual street clothes drinking

at the temporary bar.

Price looks over to see the smiling Oates.

Oates holds up his Kodak Instamatic camera.

PRICE TURNS AND WALKS AWAY

Price keeps walking, into the crowd, where he finds Claire.

Oates orders another Nicalibre, and beats his foot to the

music.

PRICE AND CLAIRE IN THE CROWD

No answer -- a final complicated question from Claire --

they smile. Price waves for a cab which pulls over. They get

in the cab and drive away.

HOLD ON THE VICTORY CELEBRATION
