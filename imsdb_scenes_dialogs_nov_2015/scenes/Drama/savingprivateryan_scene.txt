--------------------------------------------------------------

FADE IN:

CREDITS:  White lettering over a back background.  The

THUNDEROUS SOUNDS OF A MASSIVE NAVAL BARRAGE are heard.  The

power is astonishing.  It roars through the body, blows back

the hair and rattles the ears.

FADE IN:

EXT. OMAHA BEACH - NORMANDY - DAWN

The ROAR OF NAVAL GUNS continues but now WE SEE THEM FIRING.

Huge fifteen inch guns.

SWARM OF LANDING CRAFT

Heads directly into a nightmare.  MASSIVE EXPLOSIONS from

German artillery shells and mined obstacles tear apart the

beach.  Hundreds of German machine guns, loaded with tracers,

pour out a red snowstorm of bullets.

THE CAMERA MOVES PAST THE FACES OF THE MEN

Boys.  Most are eighteen or nineteen years old.  Tough.

Well-trained.  Trying to block out the fury around them.

A DIRECT HIT ON A NEARBY LANDING CRAFT

A huge EXPLOSION of fuel, fire, metal and flesh.

THE LEAD LANDING CRAFT

The Motorman holds his course.  Shells EXPLODE around them.

FLAMING OIL BURNS on the water.  CANNON FIRE SMASHES into

the bow.

THE MOTORAMAN IS RIPPED TO BITS

BLOOD AND FLESH shower the men behind him.  The mate takes

the controls.

THE BOYS AROUND HIM

Do their best to stare straight ahead.  But the fear infects

them.  It starts to spread.

The figure is CAPTAIN JOHN MILLER.  Early thirties.  By far

the oldest man on the craft.  Relaxed, battle-hardened,

powerful, ignoring the hell around them.  He smiles, puts a

cigar in his mouth, strikes a match on the front of DeLancey's

helmet and lights the cigar.

DeLancey tries to look away but Miller grips him by the jaw

and forces him to lock eyes.  Miller smiles.  DeLancey is

terrified.

Delancey Captain, are we all gonna die?

Miller Hell no, two-thirds, tops.

Delancey Oh, Jesus...

Miller I want every one of you to look at the man on your

left.  Now look at the man on your right.  Feel sorry for

those to sons-of-bitches, they're going to get it, you're

not going to get a scratch.  A few, including DeLancey, manage

thin smiles.  Miller releases his grip on DeLancey who moves

his jaw as if to see if it's broken.  Miller pats him on the

cheek and moves on to the bow.

PAN DOWN TO MILLER'S HAND

It quivers in fear.  Miller glances around, sees that none

of the men have noticed.  He stares at his hand as if it

belongs to someone else.  It stops shaking.  He turns his

eyes back to the objective.

THE LEAD LANDING CRAFT HITS THE BEACH

The six surviving boats alongside.

EXPLOSIVE PROPELLED GRAPPLING HOOKS FIRE

From the landing crafts.  Arc toward the top of the cliffs.

THE LEAD CRAFT RAMP GOES DOWN

A river of MACHINE GUN FIRE pours into the craft.  A dozen

men are INSTANTLY KILLED.  Among them, DeLancey.

INCENDIARY GRENADES, HURLED FROM ABOVE,

EXPLODE, SPREADING FIRE

THE SOUNDS OF BATTLE

Drown out most voices.  Except the SCREAMS OF THE WOUNDED

AND DYING.

MILLER SEES A STALLED CLIMBER

A soft-faced boy.  Grabs him by the back of his collar.

Roughly yanks him up.  Nearly choking him.  They boy climbs

on.

Sees an open gap.  Deadly.  Beyond is a protective overhang.

With a clear line to the top.

Miller motions to six men huddled near him.

MILLER AND THE OTHERS

Do their best to cover them.  POUR FIRE up at the Germans.

Bad angle.  No Germans are hit.

SARGE, mid-twenties, experienced, Miller's right arm and

best friend, dives into the rocks next to Miller.

Sarge That's a goddamned shooting gallery, Captain.

Miller signals others where to direct their cover fire.

Turns to the second six.

MILLER AND OTHERS BLAST SURPRISING FIRE

JACKSON, NAILS a pair of Germans.  MILLER CUTS DOWN two more.

SARGE gets one.  Not enough.

MILLER AND THE OTHERS

OPEN UP on the Germans.

Three are HIT.  Then another.  POTATO MASHER GRENADES bounce

down.  EXPLODE below.

THE GERMAN MACHINE GUN swings toward Sarge and Reiben.  Miller

sees them about to get it...  MILLER STEPS OUT INTO THE OPEN.

A perfect target.  Captain's bars glinting.  FIRING.  TRYING

TO DRAW THE GERMAN FIRE.

THE GERMAN MACHINE GUNNER

SEES MILLER STANDING IN THE OPEN.  Too much to pass up.  He

swings the machine gun away from Sarge and Reiben, toward

Miller.

A ROW OF GERMAN BULLETS approaches Miller...he's an instant

from death.

SARGE AND REIBEN DIVE

Under the overhang to safety.

MILLER DIVES BACK TO COVER, BARELY MAKES IT, HIS BOOT HEAL

IS BLOWN OFF.

UNDER THE OVERHANG Sarge and Reiben untangle themselves.

Sarge hollers back to Miller.

Quick smiles.  MILLER AND HIS RANGERS lean out and FIRE.

HIT more Germans.

SARGE AND REIBEN run up the path, under the overhang.  Stop

near the top.  Pull pins on grenades.  Count.  Both throw

long, arcing over the crest, perfectly aimed.

THE TWO GRENADES EXPLODE.

Putt out the two worst machine gun nests.

TWO DOZEN GERMANS FIRE BACK as they retreat.

Abandoning the perimeter defense of the bunkers.  The Germans

are CUT DOWN.

MILLER motions to WADE, a small, wide-eyed, demolition man

who's struggling under the weight of half-a dozen satchel

charges.

Wade Captain, I love it when you say that.

Miller, Sarge, Reiben and Jackson cover Wade as he races to

the first of three bunkers.  Dodging bullets from inside.

Wade tosses a SATCHEL CHARGE into a gun port.  A HUGE, MUFFLED

EXPLOSION, rocks the bunker.

Sarge shakes his head at Miller, then he looks over the cliff

at the scores of men, their shattered, burning bodies covering

the rocks and the beach below.  He's clearly affected.

Miller coldly glances at the dead and wounded.  Then he moves

on, leading his surviving men toward the two remaining German

bunkers.  The SOUNDS OF BIG GUNS and MACHINE GUNS FIRE

surround him.  DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. WAR DEPARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

The SOUND OF CLATTERING MACHINE GUN FIRE SEGUES TO that of

CLATTERING TYPEWRITERS.  A huge government building stands

in the heart of Washington, D.C.

JUNE 8, 1944

INT. COMMUNICATIONS OFFICE - WAR DEPT. - DAY

Very busy.  A dozen, somber military clerks work behind desks,

quickly and efficiently.  No small talk.

INT. LIEUTENANT'S OFFICE - WAR DEPT. - DAY

Seen through the glass wall.  The clerk speaks to a YOUNG

LIEUTENANT who is visibly shaken by what he is being told.

He motions to the clerk to follow and he strides out of the

office with the clerk on his heels.

INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - WAR DEPT. - DAY

Again, seen through a glass wall.  The Young Lieutenant speaks

to a YOUNG CAPTAIN who, like the Lieutenant is clearly

bothered by what he's being told.  The Captain takes the

papers from the Young Lieutenant and strides out.

INT. COLONEL'S OFFICE - WAR DEPT. - DAY

A busy office.  Aides and secretaries scurry about.  The

walls and tables are covered with maps of Normandy and complex

deployment charts.  A ONE-ARMED COLONEL with a chest full of

ribbons pours himself another cup of coffee.  He clearly

hasn't slept in a long time.  The Young Captain, his staff

officer, walks in.

Young captain Colonel, I've got something you should know

about.

One-armed colonel Yes?

Young captain Two brothers died in Normandy.  One at Omaha

Beach, the other at Utah.  Last week in Guam a third brother

was killed in action.  All three telegrams went out this

morning.  Their mother in Iowa is getting all three telegrams

this afternoon.

The life drains from the Colonel.  Others in the room hear

and freeze.

One-armed colonel Oh, Jesus.

Young captain There's more.  There's a fourth brother.  The

youngest.  He parachuted in with the Hundred-and-First

Airborne the night before the invasion.  He's on the front.

One-armed colonel Is he alive?

Young captain We don't know.

The Colonel regains his bearings.  Stands and motions curtly

to the Captain.  One-armed colonel Come with me.

The Colonel regains his bearings.  Stands and motions curtly

to the Captain.

One-armed colonel Come with me.

The Colonel strides from the room with the Captain on his

heels.  The aides and secretaries watch them go.

EXT. FARM ROAD - IOWA - DAY

A black car drives along a dirt road, a cloud of dust rising

behind.  Passing through an endless expanse of ripening corn.

EXT. RYAN FARM - IOWA - DAY

A whit farmhouse.  A barn.  A stand of trees.  Cornfields as

far as the eye can see.

ON THE GLASS OF THE FRONT DOOR

Four American flag decals.  Each one, a man in service.

She wipes her hands on her apron and looks out across the

fields.  Far in the distance she sees the dust rising behind

the black car.

She watches the car get closer, then sees it turn toward her

house.  She starts to grow uneasy.

As the black car approaches, her breath comes hard.  She

reaches out and steadies herself on the porch post.

The car pulls up to the house.  She sees three men get out,

one wearing a clerical collar.  The first of her tears come.

INT. GENERAL MARSHALL'S OFFICE - WAR DEPARTMENT - DAY

Another busy office filled with aides and secretaries.

GENERAL GEORGE MARSHALL, Army Chief of Staff, stands next to

his conference table, reading the Ryan brother' files.  Half-

a-dozen subordinates, among them the one-armed Colonel and

the Young Captain, wait.  General Marshall puts down the

file.

One-armed colonel All four of them were in the same company

in the 29th Infantry but we split them up after the Sullivan

brothers died on the Juneau.

One-armed colonel No, sir.  He was dropped about thirty miles

inland, near Ramelle.  That's still deep behind German lines.

General Marshall hardens.

EXT. NORMANDY - CRATER FIELD - DAY

NEAR CONSTANT MORTAR EXPLOSIONS.  HEAVY MACHINE GUN FIRE.

Miller's Ranger company is pinned down by a superior force

of German troops.  The Americans hug the bottoms of the

craters, FIRING BACK as best they can.  BIG GUNS THUNDER in

the distance.

Miller barks to his RADIOMAN.

Radioman Trying, sir.

MORE EXPLOSIONS.  They all duck.  Reiben's worried.

THE GERMAN FIRE diminishes for an instant.  Miller, Sarge

and Reiben immediately rise and POUR FIRE at the German

positions.  GERMAN MACHINE GUN FIRE RESPONDS and they duck

down again.

MORE MORTAR EXPLOSIONS.

Another pause in the German shelling.  Reiben rises and BLASTS

HIS B.A.R, then ducks as the GERMANS RETURN FIRE.

Radioman Captain, I've got Command, they want you back at

H.Q., right away.

A MORTAR SHELL EXPLODES VERY CLOSE.  After the debris stops

falling, Sarge and Reiben rise, spitting out sludge.  Reiben

looks dubiously at Miller.

Miller waits for a pause in the MORTAR BARRAGE, then scrambles

out of the crater and takes off in a crouch-run.

EXT. NORMANDY - FIELD H.Q. - 19TH INFANTRY - DAY

Chaos.  Under fire.  INTERMITTENT MORTARS, SOME BIG GERMAN

SHELLS and fairly close SMALL ARMS FIRE.

INT. H.Q. SANDBAGGED BUNKER - DAY

Sand and dirt falls with the closest of the EXPLOSIONS which

continue through the scene.  Miller salutes a Major.

Major Go on in.

Miller goes deeper into the H.Q. bunker where he finds a

dozen officers with as many aides, runners and radiomen.

Very busy.  A field map dominates the center of the small

space.

The men in the room note Miller, a few nod to him

respectfully.  He's clearly someone special.

COLONEL SAM ANDERSON is in command, talking on a field-phone.

He's about fifty, firm and steady, the calm at the eye of

the storm.  He sees Miller and motions for him to wait.

A LIEUTENANT steps up to Miller and hands him a sheet of

paper.

Lieutenant Captain, here's your company address list.

Lieutenant For letters to the families of your killed-in-

action.

Miller hands the list back to the Lieutenant.

Anderson hangs up, speaks to an AIDE.

Colonel Anderson turns to Miller.

An instant of SILENCE, all hear, none look.

MILLER HESITATES, THEN:

The other officers freeze, listening without turning.  Colonel

Anderson glares at Miller.

Miller considers the question, then smiles.

Colonel Anderson looks as if he's about to bit Miller's head

off, then he smiles, too.

Miller Shrugs.

Colonel Anderson listens with amused tolerance, but it's

time to get back to business.

Miller knows when to back off.  He salutes.

Miller and Colonel Anderson exchange a private look.

Miller joins Major Thomas at one of the smaller map tables.

Colonel Anderson watches Miller for an instant, then notices

the other officers in the tent watching.  A glare and they

go back to work.

EXT. BATTLESHIP - DAY

A MASSIVE BARRAGE of fifteen-inch shells BLASTS from the

deck of the enormous ship.

EXT. CRATER FIELD - CRANBERRY BOG - DAY

HUGE EXPLOSIONS.  The big naval shells SLAM into the German

position on the far side of the cranberry bog crater field.

They wait for a lull in the firing, then scramble out of the

crater and crouch-run in opposite directions.

EXT. TRANSPORT H.Q. - NINETEENTH INFANTRY - DAY

Just in from the beaches.  DISTANT ARTILLERY AND EXPLOSIONS.

Nothing close.  Dust.  Confusion.  Vehicles of every sort

moving out.  Tanks, half-tracks, troop trucks.  In the middle

of the mess, a cigar-chewing SUPPLY SERGEANT works at a make-

shift desk made out of crate.  He yells at a PRIVATE.

Private They're blocked in!

SARGE

Wait nearby.  Reiben is beside himself, pacing, muttering.

The others are relaxed.

Miller jerks his head for his men to follow and he strides

off toward the Supply Sergeant's table.  Sarge falls in next

to Miller.

Miller ignores the question.  He spies a jeep.

The Supply Sergeant grunts as if punched in the belly.

Miller looks at him, noting his reaction coldly.  The Supply

Sergeant shifts his eyes toward General Gavin's jeep.

EXT. ROAD LEADING FROM TRANSPORT - DAY

Miller and his men drive off, fast, in General Gavin's jeep.

Sarge is at the wheel, weaving and bouncing through the bedlam

of men and vehicles.  Miller rides shotgun.  Reiben, Jackson

and Wade are crammed in the back.

The SUPPLY SERGEANT Watches them go.  Behind him, GENERAL

GAVIN, pure piss and vinegar, strides up, trailed by his

huge staff.  He looks around for his jeep, comes up empty.

The Supply Sergeant puffs his cigar with a smile and turns

to take his lumps.

EXT. ROAD - DAY

Miller and his men weave through the chaos of the American

staging area.

Miller points the way for Sarge.

EXT. INTELLIGENCE TENT - DAY

Miller and his men skid to a stop in front of a perfectly

white, taut-lined tent.  A steady stream of ROARING vehicles

and CHATTERING men move out around them.  DISTANT GUNS RUMBLE.

SPORADIC MEDIUM-DISTANCE EXPLOSIONS BOOM.  Miller hops out.

He strides into the tent.

INT. INTELLIGENCE TENT - DAY

Three bookish corporals hover over map tables like studious

nerds the day before finals.  They're breaking down and

gridding field maps and covering them in plasticine.  Tedious,

detailed work.

One of them is TIM UPHAM, a thin, twenty-four year old,

patrician with gentle, thoughtful eyes behind his thick

glasses.  He nervously jumps at the sound of a VERY DISTANT

EXPLOSION, then he forces himself to concentrate on his work.

Miller strides in.  Miller I'm looking for Corporal Upham.

Upham raises his eyes from his map and re-focuses.

Upham Sir, I'm Upham.

Upham Yes, sir.

Upham A slight one in French.  My German is clean.  It has a

touch of the Bavarian.

Upham knows enough geography to know what that means.

Upham Uh, sir, there are Germans up at Ramelle.

Upham Lots of them.

Upham Sir, I've never been in combat.  I make maps.  I

translate.

Upham But, sir, I haven't held a gun since basic training.

Upham hesitates.

Upham Sir, may I bring my typewriter?

Miller looks at him closely, not sure if he's joking.

Upham I'm writing a book and I...

Miller's expression gives him his answer.

Upham Uh, how about a pencil?

Miller shoos him off.

Upham scurries away.  Miller sighs.

EXT. ROAD LEADING FROM INTELLIGENCE TENT - DAY

Miller and his men peel out, now with Upham crammed with the

others in the back of the jeep.  As they drive off, the CAMERA

CRANES UP to reveal the vast tableau of the biggest invasion

in military history.

The scope of the operation is stunning.  The beach is covered

with mountains of supplies.  A steady stream of vehicles

winds up the dunes.  Hundreds of barrage balloons, anchored

by heavy steel cables, hover over the entire scene.  Off-

shore, a massive Mulberry port is under construction, workers

swarming over it like ants.  Beyond that, thousands of ships

and boats of every type and description.  The smoke of

hundreds of fires rises on the horizon.  EXPLOSIONS, some

distant, some close, BOOM and RUMBLE.

It's an awesome, breathtaking sight.  Miller and his tiny

band of men, weave their way through the middle of it,

speeding away from the beach, heading inland, leaving the

bulk of the American Army behind.  Ext. french road - day

Miller and his men drive fast passing American vehicles and

infantrymen moving forward.  The sides of the road are

littered with the debris of burning German vehicles, abandoned

equipment, bodies.

Sarge drives.  Miller reads a map.  Upham, cradling a pristine

M-1 rifle, is all eyes and ears.  Jackson and Wade calmly

take in the view.  Reiben checks out the close quarters in

the back of the jeep.

Miller doesn't raise his eyes from the map.

Miller points out a turn to Sarge.

Sarge makes the turn.  Miller folds up the map and pockets

it.

IN THE BACK OF THE JEEP

Upham avidly takes in everything.  He notices Reiben staring

at him, grows nervous under his look and offers a hopeful

smile.

Upham Hi.  So, uh, you're all Rangers?

Reiben, Jackson and Wade look at Upham as if he were an

insect.

Upham I'm Upham.

(pointing at his corporal's stripes)

Ignore these, please, I know all that breaks down in combat.

Their jaws drop.

Wade It's not my turn.

Upham reacts to the metion of Miller's name.

Upham Miller?

Upham Sir, are you Captain John Miller?

Miller sighs, he knows what's coming.

Upham's words are frozen in his throat by the warning glances

of Miller's men.  Miller himself remains relaxed but stone-

faced.

No one speaks for a few seconds, then the moment passes as

if it had never happened.

Wade pipes up cheerfully.

Wade Hell, I don't mind going to Ramelle, as long as there's

something up there for me to blow up.

THEY ROUND A TURN

SKID TO A STOP AT A:

BOTTLENECK OF AMERICAN VEHICLES

A LIEUTENANT is roadmaster.  Miller calls to him.

Lieutenant Bad, sir.  There're some eighty-eights hiding

somewhere, knocking the hell out of our traffic.

Lieutenant The lucky ones.

Miller nods to Sarge who floors it.  They take off, spraying

gravel behind them.  Ext. St. Mere Road - day The jeep barrels

down the road, fast.  The road is pock-marked with craters.

They pass the wreckage of a pair of American jeeps.  Direct

hits.  Sarge swerves around them without slowing.

AN AMERICAN TROOP TRUCK SMOLDERS

On the side of the road, surrounded by the charred bodies of

a dozen American troops.  It's a nightmare vision.  Upham

grows weak at the sight.  Miller takes note of Upham's

reaction.

Reiben shoots Miller a smile and shifts his belt, moving his

shovel from under his bruised ass.

THEY ROUND A BEND

See a long, straight stretch of road.  Half-a-dozen burning,

obliterated American vehicles.  A gauntlet to run.

AN EIGHTY-EIGHT SHELL SCREAMS IN

Lands right behind them.  BLOWS A NEW CRATER

SARGE FLOORS IT.  Everyone hangs on.

MILLER SCANS THE TERRAIN

Sees a cluster of buildings about half-a-mile ahead.

SUDDENLY SEES A CRATER

Tries to avoid it.  Too late.  Brakes.  PLOWS into overturned

earth.  STOPS SHORT.

REIBEN, UPHAM, WADE AND JACKSON

THROWN from the jeep.  TUMBLE into the dirt.  Not hurt.

AN EIGHTY-EIGHT SHELL SCREAMS IN EXPLODES THIRTY YARDS LEFT

Sarge puts his head back on and throws the jeep into gear.

The wheels spin.  Miller throws his shoulder into the jeep.

Yells to the others.

ANOTHER EIGHTY-EIGHT SHELL LANDS EXPLODES THIRTY YARDS RIGHT

Upham is very nervous.

They all ignore him.

Sarge SLAMS THE JEEP INTO REVERSE.  Rocks it.  SLAMS IT BACK

INTO FORWARD.  Makes progress.

ALL THE MEN PUSH, ALL EYES UP.  WAITING FOR THE NEXT SHELL.

THEY ALL PUSH LIKE MANIACS

Knowing the shell is coming any second.  Upham is beside

himself.

THEY HEAR THE SCREAM OF THE SHELL MILLER BARKS TO HIS MEN

THE SHELL SCREAMS IN

The men hit the dirt.

THEY ALL TAKE OFF

Running as fast as they can.

THE FIRST OF THE MORTAR SHELLS COME IN

The eighty-eight is big, with pauses spaces between.  But

there must be a dozen mortars firing.  The shells are almost

constant.

UPHAM IS THROWN TO THE GROUND

Miller yanks him up.  Half-drags him to the edge of the field.

THEY MAKE IT TO THE TREES

Keep running.  Through the bushes and brambles.  Thirty yards

in.

Reiben looks back through the trees at THE JEEP, which is

nothing more than a burning carcass.  He shakes his head.

Miller, far away, quickly shifts his eyes and ears from

position to position.

Sarge quickly opens up the map case.  The men are dead silent,

frozen in place.

Sarge quickly starts vectoring on the map.  Miller snaps out

of it.

Wade instantly starts cranking it up.  Upham is amazed.

Sarge finished vectoring.

Miller takes the handset from Wade and the map from Sarge.

A VOICE ON THE RADIO SIGNS OFF through the static.  Wade

packs up the radio.  Miller folds up the map.  Jackson Sir,

wouldn't take us but a minute to put out them eighty-eights.

Miller heads off without pausing or looking back.  The rest

of the men don't like it, but they follow.  Upham trails,

amazed at Miller.

EXT. WOODS - DAY

Miller walks point.  His men follow warily.  Upham falls in

alongside Reiben.

Upham smiles lamely and moves on to Jackson.

Wade overhears and smiles at Upham.

Upham shakes his head.

Jackson shrugs.

They all shake their heads.  Miller's out of earshot.

Reiben shakes his head.

They all nod in assent, no argument there.

Miller walks on ahead, unaware of their conversation.  Upham

watches Miller, with even more curiosity.

EXT. HEDGEROW FIELD - DAY

Miller and his men walk along a hedgerow that parallels a

country cow path.  They're staying close to the cover of the

brush.  Miller walks tall now.

Upham, feeling bold and a bit naughty, decides to give it a

shot.

The men roll their eyes, expecting the worst.

The men are stunned.

Upham wiggles with pride.  Upham Positive, sir, I'm certain

I'd remember.

Miller eyes Upham respectfully and nods to the men.

They walk on.

Miller smiles, situation normal.

EXT. ST. MERE - LATE AFTERNOON

A small town has been reduced to rubble and is still an active

battlefield.  HEAVY SMALL ARMS FIRE.  GRENADE AND MORTAR

EXPLOSIONS.  MEDIUM ARTILLERY BEYOND.  American soldiers

crouch in doorways, FIRING at well-placed Germans.

Some French civilians dash across a street.  A man and a

couple of women, one carrying a child.  They make it across

and disappear into the remains of a building.

Miller runs up and flattens himself against a wall at a

corner.  Sarge and the other men follow in leap-frog, spread

out down the block behind him.

Miller glances around the corner, taking a quick mental

picture of a GATHERING OF G.I.'s crouching in the cover of

an alley across the street and down the block.  They are

CAPTAIN HAMILL, about Miller's age, and HIS MEN.

As Miller ducks back behind the corner, A GERMAN BULLET

SMASHES into the bricks where his head was an instant before.

Miller motions Jackson across first.

Jackson gathers himself, takes off.  GERMAN BULLETS BLAST,

kicking up the cobblestone behind him.  Jackson zig-zags and

makes it to the cover of the far side.

Miller nods to Upham.

Upham, scared shitless, doesn't move.  Miller speaks to him

very gently.

Upham's frozen.  He can barely breathe.  Miller sighs.

Upham nods.  Miller gathers himself, takes a deep breath.

CLOSE SHOT:  MILLER'S HAND quivers.

Upham nods, still terrified.

MILLER STEPS INTO THE OPEN

Stands motionless, presenting himself to the German snipers.

Upham runs.

A GERMAN BULLET HITS THE BRICKS NEAR MILLER.

He doesn't budge.

UPHAM TEARS ACROSS THE STREET very, very fast.

REIBEN watches Upham run.

A GERMAN BULLET WHIZZES PAST Miller's ear.  UPHAM gets to

the far side.

MILLER DUCKS BACK around the corner.  Reiben and Wade don't

even react to what Miller has just done.  Sarge is pissed.

He shakes his head at Miller, like an irritated parent.

GERMAN BULLETS TRAIL HIM, shattering the cobblestones, inches

behind him.

HE MAKES IT across.  Calls back to Sarge.

UPHAM, tries to thank Miller.

Miller ignores him, motions to Sarge, Reiben and Wade.

Some badly wounded G.I.'s are being treated next to the dead.

Blood puddles have spread out onto the sidewalk.

Captain hamill Fundamentals, short runs, double up at the

corners, one man close, one man wide.  Be careful.  Go.

The squad takes off.  Captain Hamill sees Miller.  The two

captains glance at the bars on their shoulders, then speak

familiarly.

Captain hamill How was the road in?

Captain hamill Oh, what a shame.

One by one, Miller's men join them in the alley.

Captain Hamill points across a wide field toward a distant

chateau that has a private chapel with a fifty-foot steeple.

Captain hamill That's where your boy is.  We've been trying

to get him since this morning.  He killed two of my men trying

to get close enough for a shot.  Miller eyes the distant

steeple.

Jackson steps up.  Miller points to the steeple.  Jackson

knows what he's supposed to do.  He puts down his M-1 and

takes off the long, zippered, leather sheath, strapped to

his back.

He spits a massive bullet of tobacco juice, then calmly and

methodically unzips his leather case and pulls out a very

unusual, long-barrel, rifle.

Miller and his men give him some room.  Hamill and his men,

along with Upham, watch curiously.

Jackson opens a two-foot tripod with a flick of his wrist,

sits down and carefully attaches the rifle to it.  Then he

takes a scope from a narrow wooden box and mounts it.  He

adjusts the eye-piece and clicks in the bolt-action.  Upham

is fascinated.

Jackson pulls back the bolt and loads a single, over-sized

shell.

Jackson sights on a tree about a thousand yards away and

FIRES.  Evaluates.  Calibrates the scope.  He re-loads.

Jackson FIRES AGAIN.  Evaluates.  Perfect.  He wipes the

dirt and sweat from his forehead, puts his eye to the sight

and waits, absolutely motionless.

Jackson doesn't dignify that with an answer but he looks

back with an expression that clearly says, "What are you,

some kind of fucking idiot?" Reiben puts himself between

Upham and Jackson.

Jackson keeps his eye to the scope and his finger on the

trigger.

Jackson FIRES.  Waits.  A tiny smile.  He starts taking apart

the rifle.  A very impressed Captain Hamill barks to his

radioman.  Captain Hamill Get a hold of Command, tell them

the St. Mere road is open.

The Radioman cranks up his radio.  Captain Hamill turns to

Miller.

Captain Hamill How far back is the rest of division?

Captain Hamill Goddamn it, I was afraid of that.  We're in a

lot of trouble up here, and it's gonna get worse before it

gets better.  How many men did you bring?

Captain hamill Shit, are you the guys going up to find Private

Ryan?

Captain hamill Command radioed, wanted to know if he came in

with the early wounded or dead.

Several of CAPTAIN HAMILL'S MEN, among them a GENTLE-FACED

PRIVATE, prick up their ears at the mention of Private Ryan.

Captain hamill We're supposed to tell you, they intercepted

a German transmission after you left.  The Krauts have two

companies on their way to Ramelle to take back that bridge,

they'll be there sometime late tomorrow.

Captain Hamill If Ryan's alive, you'd better get him the

hell out of there before those Krauts show up.

Captain hamill You don't, until tonight, we're hemmed in

real tight.  After dark you try to slip out to the east.  If

you tip-toe, stay off the main roads and roll a few sevens,

you've got a fair chance of making it up to Ramelle by

tomorrow night.

Miller processes the information.  Captain Hamill shakes his

head.

Captain hamill Tough, huh?  Three brothers?

Miller shrugs.

Captain hamill We sure as hell could use your help here, but

I understand what you're doing?

Captain hamill Good luck.

Captain hamill I mean it.  Find him.  Get him home.

Miller is a bit taken aback by Captain Hamill's forceful

sincerity.  Then he shakes it off and motions to his men.

Miller nods to Captain Hamill, then, as he moves to the head

of the alley, Miller passes Upham.

He takes off, crouch-running back down the block.  Upham

watches him go.

The men are equal parts joking and admiring.  Sarge is

neither.

Sarge takes off after Miller.

EXT. ST. MERE CATHEDRAL - DUSK

Miller and his men are bivouaced in the middle of the ruins

of a medieval church.  Miller, settled into a comfortable

spot in the debris, eating his K-rations, looks very relaxed.

Reiben paces.

Miller smiles.  Reiben eyes him and reconsiders.

Miller nods.

Reiben eyes Miller.

Miller looks at Reiben, shocked.

Miller considers his response.

Reiben rolls his eyes.  Miller plays it straight, with no

obvious sarcasm.

The men all  learn forward expectantly, believing they're

about to find out Miller's home town.  Miller smiles.

The men ease back, disappointed.

The men wince and laugh.  Miller checks his watch and gets

serious.

The men know when to can it.  Without another word, they all

settle down into the debris, close their eyes and try to

follow Miller's order.  Upham looks around at these strange

men, then, a simple, hard glare from Miller makes him follow

suit.

Miller looks at his men, then pulls out his map case and his

flashlight.  He turns it on, in the dim glow of the light,

he studies his maps while his men rest.

EXT. ST. MERE CATHEDRAL - NIGHT (LATER)

Dark.  ARTILLERY RUMBLES IN THE DISTANCE.  Reiben, Jackson,

Wade and Upham sleep.  Miller still sits in the glow of his

flashlight, studying his maps.  Sarge lies near him, awake,

watching him.  Sarge notices some unopened envelopes in

Miller's map case and speaks quietly to him.

Miller looks at Sarge.  A moment passes between the two of

them, then miller takes refuge in the maps.  Sarge looks at

the men.

Miller considers the question, doesn't answer.

They sit in silence for a moment.

Miller looks at his watch, rises and barks at the men.

Grumbling, the men get up and start shouldering up their

gear.

EXT. ST. MERE STREET - NIGHT

SMALL ARMS FIRE ECHOES through the village.  DISTANT ARTILLERY

BOOMS.  Miller leads his men from the ruins of the cathedral

toward the outskirts of town.  They're just a small squad,

but these six, heavily-armed men, in full battle gear, are

very formidable-looking.

EXT. ST. MERE - OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT

Miller's men are getting ready to move out.  Captain Hamill

and a few of his men are there to see them off.  Suddenly:

A FLASH OF LIGHT APPEARS ON THE HORIZON

Then REPEATED FLASHES OF LIGHT.  The sky is on fire.  The

AIR TREMBLES.  A FAR OFF RUMBLING THUNDER ROLLS over the

countryside like a tidal wave.

Then, THE OPPOSITE HORIZON LIGHTS UP AS WELL.

IT'S A MASSIVE ARTILLERY BATTLE.  The MAGNITUDE OF THE FURY

is incredible, strange, other-worldly.

EVERY MAN THERE IS TRANSFIXED.

Frozen in place.  The lights play on their faces.

MILLER looks down and sees his hand quivering.

SARGE notices, says nothing.

MILLER stares at his hand, forcing it to stop.  Their eyes

go back to the BLAZING SKY.

Upham's face shows more fear than awe.

Upham recoils.  Miller instantly regrets his words.  He turns

to Upham and sees that he's really scared.  Miller get a

hold of himself and speaks gently.

Upham manages a slight smile.  Miller watches the lights for

a moment more, then he pretends to shrug it off.

Captain Hamill is next to snap himself out of it.  He points

the way.

Captain hamill Along the wall, about thirty yards, there's a

gate, on the other side, a drainage ditch, stay low until

you clear the second field, then you'll hit the woods.

As Miller and his men shoulder their gear and prepare to

move out, on of Captain Hamill's men, the Gentle-Faced Private

who was so interested in the talk of Private Ryan, steps up

with a couple bandoleers of B.A.R. ammo.  He offers them to

Reiben.

Gentle-faced private Here.

Reiben looks at the bandoleers and is about to give a smart-

ass response, when a look at the Gentle-Faced Private's

vulnerable expression stops the comment dead.

Gentle-faced private My older brother was killed at

Guadalcanal...these might come in handy.

Reiben takes the ammo.

Miller steps over, takes the bandoleers from Reiben and hands

them back to the Gentle-Faced Private.

Captain Hamill nods to the Gentle-Faced Private who takes

the ammo back.

Miller and his men head off along the wall into the darkness,

lit intermittently by the distant flashes.  Captain Hamill

and his beleaguered men, watch them go with dread and a

strange bit of hope.

EXT. FRENCH COUNTRY SIDE - NIGHT

The FINAL RUMBLES of the DISTANT ARTILLERY fade away.  The

night is dark.  The band of six Americans makes their way

warily along a French cart path.  Sarge eases up alongside

Miller and speaks quietly to him.  The others don't overhear.

Sarge How long's your hand been shaking?

Sarge looks at Miller, closely, evaluating him, they walk

on.

EXT. FRENCH CART PATH - NIGHT (LATER)

Farther along.  The men are tired but alert.  Jackson is at

point.  Miller behind him.  The others at intervals.  Sarge

brings up the rear.

A SOUND.  Jackson stops.  No one speaks, they communicate

only with hand signals.

JACKSON SIGNALS to Miller, ten, twenty, thirty men coming.

MILLER SIGNALS for the men to get off the path.  They ease

into the brush.  An instant later, a PAIR WARY GERMAN INFANTRY

MEN appear.

REIBEN grips his B.A.R. and looks to Miller for permission

to open up.  Miller shakes his head and signals, "let them

go." A moment later AN ENTIRE PLATOON OF GERMANS rounds the

bend.  Fifty men.  Heavily armed.  REIBEN breathes a sigh of

relief and lowers hi B.A.R.

THE GERMAN PLATOON passes, their boots no more than two feet

from the faces of the hidden Americans.  Upham is wide-eyed

with fear.  The others are stone-faced.

THE GERMANS PASS.

MILLER MOTIONS for his men to hold their positions.

UPHAM doesn't see the signal.  He stands, breathing a sigh

of relief, just as a GERMAN WHIP-TAIL SQUAD appears, trailing

the platoon by thirty meters, protecting their rear.

UPHAM FREEZES.  He's standing, barely in the shadows, nearly

exposed.  Shitting bricks.

Pissed, MILLER prepares to fire.  The Whip-tail squad

approaches.

Then, the GERMANS PASS, miraculously, not seeing Upham in

the shadows.  They walk on and disappear.  Upham is weak-

kneed, amazed that he's still alive.

MILLER shoots a devastating glare at him, then signals the

rest of the men to follow him into the woods.  Upham scurries

after Miller, staying close on his heels.

EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

The little band of Americans walks along the edge of a field,

parallel to a cart path.  Wary.

Miller notices Jackson and Wade drifting too close to each

other.  He SNAPS HIS FINGERS, getting their attention, and

motions curtly for them to open it up a bit.  They do so.

EXT. CROSSROADS - NIGHT

Dark.  FAINT DISTANT ARTILLERY.  Miller checks the map as

Sarge shines a red flashlight on an array of directional

signs.  One of them reads:  "Ramelle 16 Km." Miller puts

away the map.  Checks the horizon.  The first glow of dawn

is visible.

EXT. FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE - DAWN

First light.  The SOUND OF DISTANT GUNS has been replaced by

the CHIRPING OF BIRDS.  The Americans are taking five.

Miller stands, a bit apart from the others, looking out at

the view.  It's lovely.  Dew shimmers on the long grass.

The war is far away.

Upham walks next to him.  They look out at the view together

without speaking for a moment.

Miller smiles.

Upham smiles, caught.

Upham looks closely at Miller and sees that he means it.

Miller takes a last look at the view and allows himself to

feel an overwhelming wave of sadness.  Then he turns himself

back into a commander and barks at Upham.

Miller strides away.  Upham watches him, trying to figure

him out, then he simply follows him.

EXT. HEDGEROW LANE - DAWN

The seven Americans walk along a hedgerow lane, untouched by

war.  Spreading trees arch gently over the lane which is

lined with hedgerows, thick, rooted masses, impenetrable,

hundred of years old.

Miller sees SMOKE AHEAD.  He motions to the men.  They

advance.  Ext. french farm - day A burning house and barn.

An old FRENCH FARMER kneels on the ground, weeping, next to

this SLAUGHTERED FAMILY, two adult women, an adult male and

a boy, no more than ten.  His animals, a pair of cows and a

draft horse and some pigs are dead as well, shot to pieces.

A DEAD AMERICAN PARATROOPER lies sprawled in the dirt with

empty shell casings around his body.

Miller and his men approach carefully.  Miller motions to

Upham who squats down next to the French Farmer and speaks

gently to him in French.

The FARMER SPEAKS SOFTLY as if in a trance.  Upham stands

and translates.

Upham gently asks.  The FARMER ANSWERS.

Miller heads off without glancing back.  The men hesitate.

Sarge jerks his head for them to move out.  They do so.

Upham squats down and speaks softly to the Farmer, puts his

hand on the man's shoulder, then rises and follows the others.

EXT. HEDGEROW FIELD - DAY

A beautiful, hedgerow-lined field of tall grass.  The last

of the dew and morning mist is just burning off.

The six Americans walk carefully through the woods to the

edge of the field.

Miller notices something.  He silently signals stop, crouches

and scans the field and the hedgerow on the far side.

Sarge and Jackson ease up next to him.  Jackson points to

some trees nearby, freshly shattered and pock-marked with

bullets.

Wade calls quietly from a tangle of roots and brush.

Staying low, they join Wade who has found:

TWO DEAD AMERICAN PARATROOPERS

A trail of blood and flattened grass leads from the field.

MILLER, SARGE AND JACKSON

Crawl to the edge of the field, scan the far hedgerow.  The

others crawl up behind them.

Miller eases back from the edge of the field into the cover

of the brush.  He stands and takes off his pack.

Upham steels himself and steps forward.

Miller takes Upham's measure.  Wade laughs with a sneer.

Wade joins Miller in peeling off his extra gear.  Upham is

impressed.

Wade takes a grenade from Upham's chest strap.

Miller points the others to their firing positions.

As they take their positions, Miller and Sarge speak quietly,

out of earshot of the men.

Miller looks at the two dead paratroopers.

Sarge hesitates.

Sarge nods.

Sarge finds a spot.  Miller joins Wade.  Miller waits near

Upham as the other men settle into their firing positions.

Miller sees that the men are in position.  He nods to Wade.

Miller and Wade take deep breaths.  Miller Now.

MILLER AND WADE TAKE OFF AT FULL RUNS.

Onto opposite sides of the field.  Nothing happens for a

moment.  Then:

A HEAVY GERMAN MACHINE GUN OPENS UP.  MURDEROUSLY LOUD.

SHATTERING THE QUIET.

THE MACHINE GUN SWINGS TOWARD WADE MILLER JUMPS UP AND SPRINTS

WADE HITS THE DIRT

The BULLETS GRAZE the back of his helmet.

SARGE, REIBEN, JACKSON, UPHAM

Zero the machine gun.  FIRE fast as they can.  Their BULLETS

THUD INEFFECTUALLY into the hedgerow.

THE MACHINE GUN SWINGS BACK TOWARD MILLER WADE JUMPS UP AND

SPRINTS MILLER HITS THE DIRT

Bullets SMASH into the ground all around Miller.

THE MACHINE GUN SWINGS FROM MILLER

He rises and runs.  Fast.  Almost to the far hedgerow.

WADE IS HIT.  HEAVY BULLETS RIP APART HIS BELLY.  He spins.

Goes down.

SARGE, UPHAM AND THE OTHERS are horrified.  FIRE at the nest.

SARGE AND THE OTHERS POUR FIRE at the nest.

SARGE STEPS INTO THE OPEN, INTENTIONALLY DRAWING THE GERMAN

FIRE from Miller.

The GERMANS ZERO SARGE.  BULLETS THUD all around him.  Somehow

he's not hit.

THE GRENADE EXPLODES.  The four Germans in the nest are

KILLED.

SARGE hollers to the others.

SARGE AND THE OTHERS

See Miller running toward Wade.  They instantly RACE onto

the field.

ALL THE AMERICANS RUN

Converging on Wade.  Miller points, and yells, without slowing

down.

MILLER AND SARGE GET TO WADE

Throw themselves onto the ground next to him.  They both

tear out sulfa-packs.  Sarge frantically fumbles.  Ripping

one open.  Powder spills.

REIBEN AND UPHAM repeatedly glance back at Wade.

Throws the sulfa aside.  Quickly pulls out a morphine pack.

WADE LOCKS EYES WITH MILLER.  Looking at him without blame,

without forgiveness.  Drifts with the morphine.  Then: WADE

DIES

ALL ARE FROZEN IN PLACE

UPHAM begins to weep.

REIBEN FURIOUSLY MUTTERS:

Miller stares at his hand and steadies it before the men

see.  He picks up the dogtag and pockets it.

Then Miller carefully re-packs the un-used morphine and sulfa,

rises and picks up his Thompson.

Upham shakes his head.

Miller SLAMS A FRESH CLIP into his Thompson.

Miller turns and walks away without looking back.  The men

hesitate, then slowly follow him.

EXT. FRENCH COUNTRY COW PATH - DAY

A narrow footpath, arched over by trees, almost a tunnel.

The five G.I.'s walk, spread out.

Miller motions to them curtly.

They shut up.  Miller falls in step to Sarge.  Speaks quietly,

the men don't hear.

Sarge looks at Miller closely.

EXT. NARROW GULLY - DAY

Miller leads the men into a heavily overgrown gully.  A good

hiding place.

Miller speaks authoritatively and says the right things, but

there's something missing.  It's subtle.  Only Sarge notices.

He watches Miller head off into the brush alone.

EXT. SMALL CLEARING - DAY

Miller walks into a small clearing, slows then stops.  The

life drains from him.  He stands there, looking at the dirt,

tilting his head, this way and that, as if listening for

faint, distant voices.  His face shows a battle raging within,

as he fights to keep from losing it entirely.  Behind him,

Sarge steps to the edge of the clearing and watches.  Miller

senses his presence, turns and looks at him if he were a

thousand miles away.  Sarge sits down on a log and waits.

The question helps Miller pull himself back together.  He

looks at his hand and forces it to stop shaking again.

They share a smile.

They shake their heads at the madness of it all.  Miller

Hell of a...

Miller picks up his Thompson and looks around, re-orienting

himself.  He's about ninety-five percent there.

Sarge allows himself a slight smile.

Miller jerks his head for Sarge to follow.  They head back

to the men.

EXT. CLEARING - DAY

The men are all in their private worlds, thinking of Wade.

No talk.  Miller and Sarge walk back into the clearing.

Miller barks at the men.

The men get up.  Jackson is a bit slow.

No one responds.

The men exchange looks.  Jackson speaks for them.

The men pick up their equipment and prepare to move out.

Sarge and Miller exchange a silent look.  Miller shakes his

head to himself, amazed that the men still allow this shit

to work.  He knows they have no choice.

EXT. FRENCH ROAD - DAY

Miller and his men walk along the road.  The men are silent,

grim.

EXT. FRENCH PATH - DAY

Miller checks his map.  figures out where they are.  Folds

up the map, points the way and they move out.

EXT. FRENCH FIELD - DAY

More progress.  The men are still grim.

Miller laughs.  Miller I'll bite, Reiben.

No one smiles, but they trudge a bit less.

EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY

The SOUND OF HEAVY FIRING.  Miller checks a map in the brush

near the crossroads.  A sign reads:  "Ramelle 3 Km."  Miller

folds up the map.

Suddenly Miller stops dead.  He listens, hearing something

the others don't hear.  He motions for them to freeze, they

do.  The SOUND grows louder.  It's an OMINOUS RUMBLE.

EXT. FRENCH ROAD - DAY

THE RUMBLE turns into the ROAR OF A BIG GERMAN CONVOY.  Troop

trucks, armored personnel carriers, a regiment of crack

Wehrmacht troops.  Heavily armed.  Imposing.  Crossing a

bridge.

CAMERA PANS DOWN TO REVEAL

Miller and his men crowded into a culvert under the bridge.

Brush and debris partially shield the ends of the culvert.

PAIR OF GERMAN PRIVATES

See the culvert obscured by brush.  Move to check it out.

Jackson, at the mouth of the culvert, motions that the coast

is clear.  They head out.

EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF RAMELLE - DAY

A gently-sloped valley with scattered farm cottages and small,

cultivated fields, bordered by ancient, moss-covered stone

walls.  The twos is visible beyond.

Miller and his men crouch-run to the cover of one of the

stone walls.  Miller pulls out his binoculars.

ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE FIELD

There's a large gathering of German troops and vehicles.

Just then they hear an OMINOUS RUMBLE, deeper and more

threatening that that of the convoy.  The sound gets LOUDER

and LOUDER.  Miller and his men exchange looks.  They know

that sound, they don't like it.

FOUR MASSIVE GERMAN TANKS

Appear down the road, heading for the German soldiers who

greet them enthusiastically.  The tanks are tigers, huge,

far bigger than an American Sherman.  Each one, sixty-two

tons, with a big 88-mm gun, four heavy machine guns and

impregnable armor.  Each one, an infantryman's nightmare.

There are four of them.

EXT. TOWN SQUARE - RAMELLE - DAY

The SOUNDS OF SPORADIC SMALL ARMS FIRE.  The town square is

a deserted battlefield, littered with burning debris, shell

casings and bodies, German and American and a few French

civilians.  Miller and his men enter the square, weapons

ready, leap-frogging from doorway to doorway.

Miller and Sarge crouch-run to the cover of some overhanging

debris.  They listen, trying to pinpoint the exact source of

the firing.

Sarge motions his guess.  Miller nods in agreement.  He

signals for the men to follow him around, not toward, the

firing.

They move on, dashing from cover to cover.

EXT. BRIDGE - RAMELLE - DAY

A dozen AMERICAN PARATROOPERS on the bridge exchange SPORADIC

FIRE with a few German snipers hidden in the buildings near

the bridgehead.  The bridge has clearly been the scene of

heavy fighting.  Craters, burning debris and shell casings

are everywhere.  The bridge is intact, only slightly damaged.

There are dozens of German bodies along the riverbank on

both sides of the bridge.

MILLER AND HIS MEN

Crouch-run and take cover as they get within sight of the

bridge.

A YOUNG BUT GRIZZLED VOICE calls back.

Miller turns to his men.  They all come up empty.

Miller takes a breath, then DASHES out into the open, toward

the bridge.

THE GERMAN SNIPERS OPEN UP

Bullets SMASH INTO THE GROUND around Miller.

Miller makes it to the bridge and DIVES over a defensive

jumble of crates, sandbags and bodies.

He finds himself next to SERGEANT BILL FORREST who was the

young but grizzled voice that called out.  With Forrest are

some very worn-out, young AMERICAN PARATROOPERS.  Miller

catches his breath.  Forrest Navy, sir, twenty-one to

nineteen.  They won on a field goal in overtime.

Miller and the paratroopers FIRE COVER for Miller's men as

they come in.  Miller and Forrest alternately take and FIRE.

Forrest Are we glad to see you, sir, we were supposed to

hold this bridge for twenty-four hours, it's been six days.

Forrest Ryan?

Forrest motions to one of the paratroopers.

Forrest Go get Ryan.

Miller doesn't answer.  Jackson leaps over the barricade and

scrambles to them.

Jackson cranks up the five-thirty-five.  Miller turns to

Forrest.

They pause to FIRE, covering Sarge, the last of Miller's men

to leap over the barricade.

Forrest Eleven, sir.  We started with thirty-six.  The bridge

was easy to take but the Krauts have been coming back at us

ever since.  They must want it intact or we'd be long gone.

Jackson speaks into the radio handset, repeating Miller's

hailing I.D.   No response.

Forrest Sir, what do you want with Ryan?

Miller doesn't answer, he looks past Forrest and sees:

Their eyes remain glued to Ryan as he makes it to the

barricade.  He salutes Miller.

Miller looks at Ryan for a moment, amazed that he's finally

face-to-face with him.  Ryan waits.  Miller hesitates,

searching for words.  Then he speaks gently but clearly.

Miller Private, I've got some bad news for you.  Your brothers

have been killed in action.

The life instantly drains from Ryan.  His breath comes hard.

Somehow he remains upright.

Ryan All three?

Ryan sways.  Miller grabs him and eases him back, leaning

him against some sandbags.

Ryan weakly waves Miller off.  Miller motions to his men and

the paratroopers to move away.  They do so, giving Ryan a

little room.

Forrest Three brothers, the poor son-of-a-bitch.

Forrest But, sir, our orders are clear, we're to hold this

bridge until we're relieved by forward elements of the Twenty-

ninth Division.

Forrest Sir, you can't do that, these orders are from command.

A VOICE from behind them speaks simply, clearly, firmly.

They all turn and see Ryan standing there.  Miller is about

to automatically rip Ryan a new asshole for contradicting

him, but he quickly calms himself, gently touches Ryan on

the arm and speaks softly to him.

Ryan jerks away from Miller.

All eyes are on Miller and Ryan.  Miller remains patient.

That news clearly affects Ryan and the other paratroopers,

but Ryan holds his ground.  Ryan Sir, I'm still not going.

Miller speaks with restrained, but growing, anger.

Ryan stands eye-to-eye with Miller.

Miller starts to boil over.

Miller grabs Ryan by the lapels and shakes him.  Ryan doesn't

resist.

Ryan speaks softly.

Miller considers it.  Then REIBEN SPEAKS UP from behind

Miller.

Miller slowly turns and glares.

Miller's more amazed than pissed off.  Reiben smiles.

JACKSON STEPS FORWARD.

Miller turns his glare on Jackson.

Miller does a slow burn.

UPHAM STEPS FORWARD

SARGE STEPS UP

Miller looks at FORREST AND THE PARATROOPERS.

Forrest We weren't planning on going anywhere, sir.

Reiben smiles.

Miller's eyes almost pop out of his head.  Miller The vote?

What the hell are you talking about?  We don't vote.  This

isn't a democracy.  This is the army, I give orders, you

follow them.  We don't vote!

They all quickly nod.

All the others Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.

Miller looks from face to face.

That's what they wanted to hear.  Miller doesn't give them

time to enjoy it, he immediately starts barking orders.

They all hurry off, except for Ryan who locks eyes with Miller

for a moment.

Ryan salutes.

Miller shakes his head at himself and strides off to check

the defensive perimeter with Ryan at his side.

EXT. BRIDGE - DAY

Miller and Reiben watch as Forrest, Ryan and a couple other

paratroopers lay out their weapons and ammo inventory.

Forrest Two machine guns, twenty-two grenades, two Gammon

grenades, six satchel charges, twenty-six M-1's, eight Tommy

guns and about sixty rounds per man.

Reiben looks at the sparse array of weaponry.

Miller sighs, worried.

EXT. BRIDGEKEEPER'S HUT - DAY

Jackson, perched on the bridgekeepers hut, protected by a

crescent of sandbags.  His eye is at his scope.  He FIRES.

Reiben, Jackson and Upham, stone-faced, watch Ryan.

Miller eyes the buildings near the bridge head.  He speaks

to Sarge who holds several satchel charges.

Just then they hear the sound of A BIG GUN FIRING IN THE

DISTANCE.  They all turn at the sound.

Miller nods.

Forrest Just south of town.  The Krauts have a two gun

emplacement, we saw it on the way in.  That's how we knew

they wanted the bridge intact, they didn't blow the crap out

of us.

Upham listens to the eighty-eights with particular interest.

INT. BUILDING - DAY

Within sight of the bridge.  Sarge carefully plants a wire-

triggered satchel charge at the door of the building.  He

sets the wire, then carefully backs away.

EXT. BRIDGE - EVENING

Reiben and Ryan pile sandbags, finishing a forward machine

gun nest.  Miller looks around, evaluating, Sarge and Upham

at his side.

Miller is stone-faced, then he smiles.

Upham runs off.  Sarge shakes his head.

EXT. BRIDGEHEAD - NIGHT

Dark.  Miller, Jackson and Forrest darken their faces with

blackening soot.  The rest of Miller's men and several

paratroopers, including Ryan, look on.  Upham is distressed.

Upham It was my idea, sir, you've got to let me go.

RYAN Steps up to Miller.

Miller smiles.

Miller checks Jackson and Forrest.

Forrest Yes, sir.

Miller, Forrest and Jackson prepare to move out.

Jackson shoots him a glare, then he follows Miller and Forrest

into the darkness.  Sarge, Ryan and the other watch them go.

EXT. GERMAN EIGHTY-EIGHT EMPLACEMENT - NIGHT

A German eighty-eight FIRES, sending its big shell into the

night.  It's eight-man crew re-loads.

A moment later he's joined by Forrest.  A moment after that,

Jackson silently crawls up to them.

EXT. MACHINE GUN NEST - BRIDGE - NIGHT

Sarge, Upham and Reiben sit with Ryan in the darkness.  Ryan

is lost in thought, far away.  One after another, Miller's

men eye him.

Ryan nods.  Then, with some difficulty, he makes the trip

from Iowa back to France.  He turns to Sarge.  Ryan What was

the name of the guy who got killed coming up here?

The others nod in agreement.  They look closely at Ryan.

EXT. GERMAN EIGHTY-EIGHT EMPLACEMENT - NIGHT

Dark.  No firing.  Two German soldiers on watch.

Miller sees Jackson easing up behind another sentry.  Miller

nods to Jackson.  They move at the same moment.  Behind the

sentries.  SLIT THEIR THROATS.

Together they attach the eighty-eight's carriage to the

German's truck.

Forrest DIVES, FIRES BACK.

MILLER frantically attaches the eighty-eight to the truck.

FORREST CUTS DOWN, several more Germans.

JACKSON TAKES A GRAZING SHOT IN THE SHOULDER.

Spins.

Still FIRING.

Giving Miller cover.

MILLER LEAPS into the cab of the truck.

JACKSON AND FORREST LEAP into the back.

JACKSON FIRES into the approaching Germans.

Glass flies everywhere, cutting Miller on the face and hands.

Spraying the Germans with his Thompson.

MILLER FLOORS IT.

The truck DRIVES through the Germans.

The Germans FIRE at the truck and trailing eighty-eight.

MILLER, JACKSON AND FORREST Drive into the night.

The Germans FIRING after them.

EXT. ROAD LEADING TO THE BRIDGE - NIGHT

Miller, Jackson and Forrest barrel down the road through a

gauntlet of Germans.  As they approach the bridge, the other

American's FIRE COVER for them.

Miller drives the truck onto the bridge.

SMASHES INTO THE SANDBAGS

THE OTHER AMERICANS, with Ryan in the lead, leap over the

barricade and drag the captured eighty-eight onto the bridge.

Ryan ignores him.  They get the eighty-eight safely behind

the barricade.  Miller grabs Ryan.

Miller fumes.  he sees Reiben, Sarge and Upham, shrugging,

clearly not pissed at Ryan.

Miller GROWLS.

Miller glares at Ryan, then strides off.

EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

Miller and Upham carefully dig up a German mine.  Very

gingerly they place it on a growing pile of other mines.

EXT. ROAD LEADING TO BRIDGE - NIGHT

Miller and Ryan lay a mine into the dirt.  They cover it and

step back carefully.

Then they proceed with the next.  Upham is covering their

tracks while Jackson is digging the holes in which they'll

place the rest of the mines.

EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

Quiet.  Dark.  Everything is ready.  There's nothing to do

now but wait.

ON THE BRIDGEKEEPERS HUT

Reiben and Jackson sit behind the sandbags.  They can see

Ryan sitting in the moonlight about twenty yards away, manning

the rear machine gun nest with Sarge.

Jackson shrugs.

They're quiet for a moment.

Their eyes keep coming back to Ryan.

Miller points, directing Reiben to the forward machine gun

nest.

REIBEN jumps down and moves forward.

MILLER runs across the bridge and joins Sarge and Ryan in

the rear machine gun nest.

Miller and Sarge exchange a look.  Then Miller slips off to

check the others.

EXT. BRIDGE - DAWN

First light.  The Americans are ready for battle.  WE SEE

them in their positions:

FORREST AND THE PARATROOPERS

Behind the second of two barricades set up between the forward

and the rear machine gun nests.

SOUND FROM DOWN THE ROAD

All eyes turn.

SINGLE GERMAN SOLDIER

Dashes across the street.  Exposed only for an instant.

Then another.  And another.

A RUSH OF GERMANS ADVANCE, BLASTING AT THE BRIDGE.

THE AMERICANS RETURN FIRE

REIBEN FIRES IN ARCS.

Reiben rolls out of the nest, carrying the fifty caliber.

Upham follows, carrying the ammo boxes.  They run as fast as

they can.

THE OTHER AMERICANS FIRE COVER

REIBEN takes a glancing slug.  Falls.  Rolls and gets up.

Bleeding from the side, but not mortal.  Upham helps him.

They MAKE IT TO THE SANDBAGS of the first barricade.

DIVE OVER.  The Germans are almost on them.

HAND-TO-HAND.

FORREST AND THE OTHER PARATROOPERS

FIRING COVER for Miller, Reiben and Upham, don't see a

flanking Germans squad easing along the riverbanks.  Two of

the Germans LOB POTATO MASHERS among the paratroopers.  THE

PARATROOPERS see the grenades.  Too late.

THE POTATO MASHERS EXPLODE KILLING FORREST AND THE OTHER

PARATROOPERS RYAN SEES FORREST AND THE OTHERS DIE

No time to react.

Miller KILLS TWO MORE WITH A BURST.

UPHAM AND REIBEN AND JACKSON

All see it.  SIMULTANEOUSLY SHOOT the German.

MILLER SLAMS in a fresh clip.  FIRES an arc.  DROPS four

Germans.  Sees an oncoming RUSH OF GERMANS.  BARKS to Reiben

and Upham:

They retreat, firing back as best they can, trying to make

it to the barricade.

THE OTHER AMERICANS FIRE for all they're worth.  Trying to

cover Sarge.  Too many Germans.

SARGE TAKES A SHOT IN THE BACK.  FALLS.  MILLER AND THE OTHERS

continue to fire, horrified.

SARGE STRUGGLES TO HIS FEET

Cradling the B.A.R.  Stumbling toward cover.  Slowing.

Bleeding.

ALL THE AMERICANS STAND AND FIRE

As best they can.  Right past Sarge.  It's not enough.

He looks to Miller.  Takes two more stumbling steps.  Falls

onto the sandbags.  Dropping the B.A.R. over the edge.  Dies.

THE AMERICANS FIRE MADLY, CONTINUOUSLY

REIBEN, UPHAM, JACKSON, RYAN fire at the retreating Germans.

THE GERMANS RETREAT.

Around the corner.

They hesitate.

They follow the order.  All except Ryan, who doesn't move.

He can't take his eyes off Sarge.

Miller looks up at Ryan, then back at Sarge's body.  Miller

grows cold, making the same startling transformation he made

as he kneeled over Wade's body.

But this time it doesn't work.  He can't make it stick.  The

hard expression, disappears.  He drifts, utterly lost.  He's

called his own bluff.

EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT

Dark.  Quiet.  The distant guns are silent for once.

Waiting.  Reiben, Upham, Jackson, Ryan and Miller have

tightened their perimeter.

Miller is in a trance.  The others glance at him nervously.

They eat in silence.  K-rations.  Some bread.  A last supper.

Then, from out of nowhere, Miller speaks:

Slowly, Miller's men turn to him.

They all sit in silence.

They all nod, except Ryan who doesn't know what Miller's

talking about.

They all share Reiben's dream for a moment.  Then Jackson

smiles.

Upham smiles.

Miller smiles.  He knows exactly where he is.

They're all silent for a moment.  Then Miller turns to Ryan.

Ryan sighs.

They all nod.  Miller tears off a piece of bread and passes

it to Ryan who tears off a bit and passes it on.  They all

eat in silence.

EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF RAMELLE - DAWN

First light.  Lovely.  Dew shimmers.  A ground fog drifts.

A SOUND.  Louder.  And louder.  A GERMAN TIGER TANK RUMBLES

toward the village.

EXT. BRIDGE - RAMELLE - DAWN

All are awake.  At their positions.  Waiting.

THE GERMANS ADVANCING AGAIN

THE GERMANS KEEP COMING

Lots of them.  Moving from cover to cover.  FIRING.

HE DIVES over the sandbags.  barely makes it.  TRAILED BY

BULLETS.

RYAN SHOOTS one.  GRAPPLES with the other two.

RYAN FALLS BACK.  Stunned, unhurt.

REIBEN only gives him a quick look.  Gets to the MACHINE

GUN.

OPENS UP against the Germans who are still coming.  FIRES A

LONG BURST.  Germans drop.

They start working their way to the tops of the nearby

buildings.

Making their way along the riverbanks.

SEVERAL GERMANS ZERO UPHAM

OPEN UP on him.

BULLETS TRAIL UPHAM.  He's outrunning them.  Almost there.

RYAN STUNNED.

For just a micro-second.  No time.  Grabs the ammo.  REIBEN

FIRING.  Ryan clips the new ammo belt onto the tail of the

one almost out.

THE GERMANS START TO FALL BACK

Then RYAN AND MILLER converge at the eighty-eight.  THE FIRST

TANK APPEARS Huge.  Terrifying.  Clanking.  Trailed by two

German infantry platoons.

A GERMAN INFANTRYMAN SPOTS JACKSON.  Hollers into the tanks

voice-tube.

TANK AGAINST EIGHTY-EIGHT.

Which can fire first.

DESTROY THE SECOND TANK.

RUNS down the bridge.  Right toward the two advancing tanks.

DESTROYING THE THIRD TANK.

RYAN jumps behind the second machine gun.  Opens up.  Helping

to cover Miller.

THE LAST GERMAN TANK

Turret spins.  Turning toward the fast approaching Miller.

Ready to blow him to bits.

THE TIGER'S MACHINE GUNS OPENS UP ON HIM.

BLASTS A TRAIL OF BULLETS

THE LAST TIGER TANK EXPLODES

MILLER, RYAN, REIBEN continue FIRING.

Almost out of ammo.

MILLER SCRAMBLING UP THE EMBANKMENT, back onto the bridge,

hears something over the SOUNDS OF FIRING.

Ryan and Reiben cease firing.  Now they hear it, too.

A RUMBLE, DEEPER AND MORE OMINOUS than any they've heard

yet.

They wait.  The RUMBLE GETS LOUDER AND LOUDER.

THEN MILLER'S FACE STARTS TO CHANGE...a hint...of a

smile...then a real smile...

AN AMERICAN SHERMAN TANK APPEARS from over the rise.  Then

ANOTHER...AND ANOTHER...AND ANOTHER...

MILLER, REIBEN AND RYAN

Stand there, stunned, watching tank after tank appear, along

with scores of heavily-armed American soldiers.

They keep coming and coming.  American tanks, with wave after

wave of U.S. infantrymen, looking for targets.  They find a

few among the departing Germans.

A MAJOR strides up.

Major Report, Captain.

The Sergeant and several other soldiers overhear.

One of the soldiers speaks quietly to another.

Soldier That's him, that's Ryan.

The Major puts his hand on Ryan's shoulder.

Major Command is looking for you, son.  You're going home.

Ryan looks up, tired.  He nods.

EXT. RAMELLE BRIDGE HEAD - DAY

American tanks and hundreds of fresh troops stream down the

road and over the bridge.

MILLER, RYAN AND REIBEN

Watch.  In a small area, cleared of the debris, the bodies

of Jackson, Upham, Sarge, Forrest and the other paratroopers

are laid out, neatly, respectfully, covered.

Miller and Reiben stay protectively close to Ryan, as if

they don't want to risk him being bumped into or run over by

any of the advancing troops or vehicles.

REIBEN AND RYAN watch silently.

Miller takes a last look at the bridge and the bodies, then

he shoulders his gear.  Miller Let's move out.

Reiben and Ryan gather up their gear.  They walk with Miller

down the road, away from the bridge.

They walk on, disappearing in the distance among the hundreds

and hundreds of American soldiers who are marching down the

road and over the bridge.

Fade out.

THE END -
