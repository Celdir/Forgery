OFF STAGE

In the rafters a stagehand opens valves.   It starts to

RAIN.

The actor who will play "Ben JONSON" (mid 30's) appears

in the wings, bearded, ready to go on stage, holding a

prop leather manuscript. Behind him a group of

Elizabethan "soldiers" strap on their swords.

ON STAGE

"Prologue" continues, as do TITLES.

The rain has intensified. "Prologue" turns and the

camera starts to leave him and the TITLES END....

A FLASH OF LIGHTNING, and for a moment only sheets of

RAIN are visible. No stage, no "Prologue". Then,

trough the rain, we see a form of a man... Ben

Jonson... running. Then we make out the shapes of

houses... a street. We're not on a stage anymore. We

are:

THROUGH THE CRACKS OF THE STAGE'S FLOORBOARDS

--the soldiers jump onto the stage and spread out, Pole

amongst them.

Nothing.    A beat, then--

The soldier hesitates.

The soldiers obey, lighting fire to the walls, the

galleries, the columns as--

JONSON

GASPS in horror. Desperate-- he spies an open metal

box nearby filled with un-used fireworks.

He tosses the fireworks out of the box-- and then

places the bound manuscripts in their place, then

closes the box. Then-- he grabs a nearby rapier as--

FLAMES

--begin to take hold everywhere: the columns at the

front of the stage... the trompe-l'oeil walls... the

seating galleries... the columns...

A TRAP DOOR

opens center-stage, and Jonson JUMPS out, the rapier in

his right hand, ready for a fight. But-- three

soldiers jump onto the stage, pikes ready.

Jonson-- no fool- turns and runs for the other end of

the stage-- but then runs smack into four other

soldiers!

Ballocks!

Jonson turns this way and that-- nowhere to run-- grins

wryly, drops his sword. Raises his hands in surrender.

13   INT. TOWER OF LONDON - AN INTERROGATION ROOM - DAWN      13

And a guard BACKHANDS Jonson on the face full force--

hard enough to send Jonson and the chair to the ground.

His nose starts to bleed.

As the Guards pull him up, the Interrogator looks

across the room-- there is someone else there, a

FIGURE, watching, but cloaked in the darkness.

Jonson notices the figure as well.      We hear a voice

from the darkness.

And SMACK!    He's hit by the guards again.   He SPITS out

a tooth.

Jonson stares at him a beat, and then looks into the

darkness.

And SMACK--

FACES

laughing. Not in this room, somewhere else. Somewhere

outside. Before we really understand what we are

seeing we are:

BACK IN THE CELL

Jonson blinks, trying to stay conscious.      His mouth is

ripped, bleeding. So is his nose.

15   EXT. ROSE THEATER/BANKSIDE LONDON - CONTINUOUS               15

Oxford pauses at the entrance.

Southampton grins and gives a few coins to an USHER,

who escorts the two of them (the retainers stay

outside) inside.

INT. THE ENTRY OF THE ROSE THEATER - CONTINUOUS

The usher takes them up a flight of stairs.    Oxford

observes everything as they walk.

They come to the second floor, where a SELLING-MAID has

a box of food and drink in front of her bosom-- much

like a match-stick girl.

Southampton waves her off as they follow the usher up

another flight of stairs.

And as they ascend up more stairs, Oxford catches

glimpses of the stage and performance through the

rafters and over the heads of the attending audience.

Oxford is becoming intrigued by the theater, almost

despite himself.

Oxford continues up, two steps behind Southampton.

They come to the third floor and enter the box seating

area reserved for nobles, giving Oxford his first real

look at the theater itself. Oxford looks around and

sees-

FROM OXFORD'S POV

Audience members LAUGHING-- others DRINKING-- maids

SELLING food-- the actors ACTING...

It's alive.   Magical.

BACK TO OXFORD

Oxford takes it all in, almost stunned by it.

ON-STAGE

The actor William SHAKESPEARE (30) plays a commoner.

He is handsome, sexy, charismatic; and holds a tankard

of ale, and SWIGS from it constantly.

Another actor SPENCER (30) plays "FASTIDIOUS"; a

pompous, over-dressed, caricature of a nobleman.

He wears an enormous feather on his hat. Also on stage

is an actor called John HEMINGE (late 40's), who plays

"Sogliardo"

The audience ROARS in laughter as Shakespeare looks

below at a buxom young lady among the "groundlings".

He smiles seductively. She smiles back.

BACKSTAGE

Jonson (now 25 and clean-shaven) is watching the

performance from behind a curtain, silently speaking

the lines with the actors.

IN THE RAISED SEATING

A group of playwrights and poets watch the play with an

air of judgement. They are: Christopher "Kit" MARLOWE

(32), young, brilliant, a bit foppish (he likes the

boys), Thomas NASHE (late 30's)-- a heavy-set, a hard

drinking satirist-- and Thomas DEKKER (29), considered

a bit of a hack by his colleagues.

They are called the "Mermaid's Wits" because they

frequent a pub named The Mermaid's Tavern.

The others smile as a WOMAN passes.

Marlowe gives the woman a few pennies as--

Marlowe glances across the theater and spots

Southampton siting next to Oxford.

Nashe squints.

ON STAGE

Shakespeare points to "Fastidious".

Shakespeare struts around as though he owned the place.

The more he talks, the more the audience ROARS in

laughter.

More groundlings laugh.     Interestingly--

NOBLEMEN

in the box seats do not.

ON STAGE

Shakespeare continues his rant, speaking directly to

the groundlings.

As the audience HOWLS in laughter, we see:

A NOBLEMAN

with a feathered hat gets up in fury, and exits the

theater, his lady with him. The Audience LAUGHS at him

as he goes.

ON STAGE

Shakespeare smiles triumphantly.

OXFORD

Watches the nobleman with the big feathered hat pass

by.

BACKSTAGE

Later in the play...

Shakespeare returns backstage and takes a deep swig

from his tankard. He's actually drunk, though his

performance didn't show it at all. He spots Jonson,

and grabs him.

Shakespeare turns to see a furious Philip HENSLOWE

(50'S) heading his way.

Shakespeare hides the goblet behind his back.

He is interrupted by SCREAMS.    Not from actors on

stage, but by the audience.

IN THE THEATER

Complete panic erupts as dozens of The Queen's Guard

STORM into the theater. Everyone tries to get out as

quickly as possible, including the other actors, Henry

CONDELL (20's), Thomas POPE (30's), William SLY (13).

SIR RICHARD POLE, THE CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD

--jumps on stage.

The audience begins to BOO at the mention of Cecil.

IN OXFORD'S BOX

He gets up. Oxford does not, seemingly interested in

the real drama below as everyone hurries from the

theater.

Oxford turns to him, distracted, and nods.

ON STAGE

Jonson pushes his way on stage.

Jonson is grabbed by guards.

17   INT. A JAIL CELL - DAY                                        17

19   INT. CHANGING ROOMS/ESSEX HOUSE - DAY                      19

Southampton pauses in clothing himself.   This is

serious.

BEHIND THEM

Oxford enters. They don't notice, though. He

instantly realizes he shouldn't say anything. He

listens as:

WIDER

Southampton stiffens at that last phrase.

20   EXT. ESSEX HOUSE - DAY                                         20

They stop. Southampton makes sure that his men are out

of earshot.

And then he feels instantly ashamed of having said

that.

Oxford nods, still worried, and Southampton heads for

his horse.

21   EXT. CECIL HOUSE - SUNSET                                  21

22   INT. CECIL HOUSE - GREAT HALL - DUSK                       22

Robert Cecil looks annoyed, but holds his tongue as the

SOUND of pikes HITTING the floor silences the hall.

A FOOTMAN clears his throat and--

DOUBLE DOORS

open, and Elizabeth (in her 60's) enters. She is

wearing a large sparkling pearl-encrusted dress with a

wide collar.

She walks slowly and carefully, and has a slight tremor

in her head and hands. She seems un-certain; like

she's not sure she recognizes all the faces around her

(Alzheimer's?). And she compensates for it by being

all the more regal, all the more un-human.

Essex is on her arm, dressed in a splendid jewel-

encrusted doublet.

Robert Cecil FROWNS at the sight of Essex on her arm.

Essex ignores Cecil's glare, notices Southampton--

Southampton CLAPS his hands and a door across the room

OPENS.

A DWARF enters, followed by dancing faires, actors

swirling sparklers, and musicians playing music.

Elizabeth's rheumy eyes widen in complete delight, a

smile of total jubilation crosses her face.

Robert Cecil, on the other hand, looks horrified.

The dwarf bows his assent.

Robert Cecil turns to Essex, shocked.

Robert frowns as Elizabeth looks around, unsure of the

political tides around her. Then--

23   EXT. THE GROUNDS AT CECIL HOUSE - NIGHT                          23

ON STAGE

Several actors are mid-scene in "A Midsummer Night's

Dream" (Act 3, Scene 1), their make-up quite elaborate

and fantastical: "Bottom", who is costumed as a man--

except that he has a DONKEY'S HEAD, "Quince", a

commoner, "Puck", played by the dwarf who is now

dressed like a cupid, and "Titania", Queen of the

fairies, who is presently asleep in a bed of fur. Puck

hides behind a tree watching.

BACKSTAGE

Oxford watches from behind a curtain, carefully

observing the Queen's reaction. Somehow we feel that

seeing her again after so many years stirs up some deep

emotion in him.

ON STAGE

Titania awakens in her nest-like bed of fur.

ELIZABETH

strongly reacts to Titania awakening.   It stirs some

memory in her. A pleasant memory.

OXFORD

watches, delighted by her reaction.

FROM HIS POV

We see Elizabeth watching. But it is an Elizabeth only

26 years old (referred to as YOUNG ELIZABETH in this

script). We HEAR the sound of other dialogue, but from

the same play. We are:

24   INT. HEDINGHAM CASTLE - GREAT HALL - NIGHT                    24

25   INT. HEDINGHAM CASTLE - KITCHEN - LATER                        25

She thinks.   Then--

She smiles, claps.

26   INT. A JAIL CELL - DAY                                        26

27    EXT. OXFORD STONE - GARDEN - DAY                                 27

Jonson doesn't know who he is talking about.

Oxford looks over to his wife who watches them

suspiciously. He begins to walk away forcing Jonson and

Francesco to follow.

Jonson suddenly looks worried and turns and looks back

to Anne.

They have come to an entrance to a GARDEN MAZE and Anne

watches them as they disappear into the maze.

28   EXT. MAZE - DAY                                           28

Jonson tries not to be offended.

Jonson pales.   This is a disaster for him.

Jonson looks down at the manuscript, reads a few lines.

29   EXT. CECIL HOUSE - DAY                                      29

32   INT. CECIL HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY                              32

Finally Boy Robert Cecil turns and sees Young Oxford

(now 17) entering the hallway with William Cecil and

his wife and daughter, Young ANNE (15). In front of

them, lined up, are several men whom we will learn are

TUTORS.

Boy Robert Cecil doesn't move.

Boy Robert Cecil watches as his father turns to his

mother and sister.

Young Anne curtsies.

Everybody turns and sees the odd hunchback child has

finally come over.

Master Crane bows his head.

Boy Robert frowns at the correction.

Mister Golding bows his head in appreciation.

William Cecil seems to have finished.

39   INT. WHITEHALL PALACE - OLD ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM - DAY           39

Elizabeth's wig is being glued into place.

THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SCREEN (THEN INTERCUT EACH SIDE

OF SCREEN AS NEEDED)

William Cecil hasn't realized that his son Robert has

sneaked in the room behind him to listen in.

William Cecil hesitates slightly, then--

Not what William Cecil wanted to hear.

Three ladies-in-waiting approach with three different

gown. Elizabeth studies them as:

Elizabeth points to one of the dresses, and waves the

handmaidens away.

But William's flash of victory is dampened by--

40   INT. CECIL HOUSE - GREAT HALL - DAY                           40

41   INT. WESTMINSTER ABBEY - DAY                                41

42   INT. THE ROSE THEATER - DAY                                 42

Marlowe takes a swig of ale, and spots Jonson coming to

join them.

Jonson sits next to Marlowe.

Before Jonson can answer--

ON STAGE

An actor, CONDELL (40's), dressed all in white (even

his face is painted white) enters stage. He is

"Prologue". He addresses the audience directly.

IN THE GALLERIES

Jonson seems surprised.   This is not what he expected.

This is good.

HORSE HOOVES

THE GROUNDLINGS

become literally spellbound.

The entire audience stands and CHEERS madly.

OXFORD

watches, with a pride he has never felt.

IN THE GALLERIES

The "wits" look at each other amazed.

OXFORD'S BOX

He sees Oxford, who is applauding.    All the actors of

the play are taking their bows.

Oxford processes this.

IN THE GALLERIES

Marlowe and others join in.   And--

BACKSTAGE

Shakespeare, standing next to a small table of props,

quickly dips his fingers in an inkwell to make them

stained. He grabs a large feathered quill and tucks a

piece of parchment under his arm, then hurries--

ON STAGE

--where he bows deeply, loving the adulation.

IN OXFORD'S BOX

52   INT. OXFORD STONE - STUDY - DAY                             52

And then he goes back to writing.

She stares at him.

Oxford turns to her, full of emotion

Anne storms over and grabs the parchment from under

him, and begins RIPPING it up.

He stares at her, almost uncomprehendingly.   Then--

53   EXT. LONDON BRIDGE - DAY                                    53

The Buxom Blonde smiles at Shakespeare seductively.

Jonson leaves the stall, and continues down the street.

Shakespeare hesitates, then gives the girl a dazzling

smile. She smiles back, then Shakespeare runs after

Jonson.

54   INT. THE ROSE THEATER - DAY                                  54

55   INT. RICHMOND PALACE - GREAT HALL - NIGHT                    55

Young Elizabeth, who is dancing with the Spanish

AMBASSADOR.

YOUNG ELIZABETH

seems less than interested in her dancing partner.    She

STARES intently back at Young Oxford.

WIDER

There is a natural change in the music, and all the

dancers switch partners-- it's part of the dance.

Young Oxford goes to Young Elizabeth, the Spanish

Ambassador goes to Anne.

YOUNG ELIZABETH AND YOUNG OXFORD

stare into each others eyes as they dance the intricate

moves.

Elizabeth smiles.

WIDER

Much of the Court is watching this.   They can tell

there are sparks between them.

All the dancers change partners, including Elizabeth

and Oxford. A few dance moves, and Oxford once again

finds himself with Elizabeth.

Young Oxford dips his head slightly in acknowledgment.

Was that a come-on?    Young Elizabeth decides to find

out.

Young Oxford glances over at--

YOUNG ANNE

who is now dancing with the Spanish Ambassador. But

she watches Young Elizabeth and Young Oxford with a

great deal of jealousy.

WILLIAM CECIL

Follows his daughter's look. He doesn't like what he

sees any more than Young Anne does.

BACK TO YOUNG ELIZABETH AND YOUNG OXFORD

Still dancing.

A beat as this sinks in.

He stares intensely into her eyes.    And she stares

right back.

60   INT. RICHMOND PALACE - RECEIVING CHAMBER - NIGHT                60

She's only teasing.

But then she realizes he's serious, and the smile

vanishes.

Her eyes narrow as she studies his face.

She stands, wrapped in her sheets, furious at the

thought of once more being used.

A beat.

And she steps back, waiting for him to exit.

Young Oxford stands... and starts to approach her...

He's nude, his back to us.

She steps back, a bit stunned by his impertinence.   He

steps towards her as--

A bit stunned by his approach, she stumbles backwards

on her sheets.

But he's sexy... and naked. And spouting poetry.     She

stops retreating and allows his approach.

A small smile escapes her lips.

He starts to kiss her neck.   Cautiously at first.   But

she likes it.

She responds to him, melting from both his words and

touch. They start to kiss deeply, passionately... And-

Young Elizabeth turns to Bessie.

William Cecil thinks.

William Cecil looks startled.

She gives him a sharp look.

Young Elizabeth hears him, thinks on it, then begins

pacing again.

He knows the answer to that.

Jonson gets up and walks towards the door.

Jonson turns around.

Jonson is stunned.

Jonson suddenly turns to him.

Shakespeare gives him a look to kill.

Shakespeare shows no reaction.

IN THE PIT

The bear baiting begins.

WIDER

Shakespeare stares at Jonson.

Some of the spectators BOO while others CHEER, and--

And he gets up and leaves as the--

DOGS

start to go for the bear's throat.     Thge cheering goes to

Shakespeare is uncomfortable. He wasn't expecting

Oxford himself. Then he just goes for it.

Oxford is silent. Francesco goes to physically eject

Shakespeare from the room.

Shakespeare looks at Francesco, then Oxford.

A beat as Young Oxford thinks on all this.

Oxford reluctantly NODS.    William Cecil goes to leave.

William Cecil turns.

Cecil's face goes to stone.

Jonson looks over at Shakespeare. Shakespeare locks

eyes with him, but looks away, ashamed of something.

Shakespeare doesn't want to discuss this with the

others present.

He grabs Jonson's shoulder, but Jonson pushes him away.

Shakespeare looks at the confused Nashe and Dekker

nervously.

She doesn't have to say which one. Robert Cecil sees a

copy of "Venus and Adonis" on a table. He NODS.

Robert Cecil knows to be silent.   She looks out the

window.

She smiles seductively, transported in time.

A beat.

Elizabeth's eyes flare in anger for an instant, then

she regains composure.

Robert Cecil nods.

Robert Cecil hesitates.

She seems surprised. Perhaps she was expecting Essex.

But then she smiles, and NODS in approval.

Elizabeth goes into a rage.

Robert Cecil is surprised by her fury. He bows his

head as Elizabeth tries to collect herself.

She says no more, the audience over. Robert Cecil

hesitates, and then she glares at him... He bows and

exits, the fury on his face plain.

Elizabeth looks at her own reflection in the window...

Jonson thinks a beat-- that's odd-- but then holds up

his manuscript.

Jonson looks confused.

IN THE GALLERIES

Jonson is putting the pieces together.   He stands.

Jonson heads for the stairs.

Nashe and Dekker are baffled as Jonson rushes down the

stairs.

BACKSTAGE

Shakespeare turns to Burbage.

We can start to HEAR the audience chanting "Ess-ex,Ess-

ex"...

ON STAGE

It's getting unruly.

Oxford kneels.

Elizabeth turns away from him, angered.   She walks to a

window, turns her back on him.

A long beat before--

She has a coughing fit. Oxford patiently waits until

she has recovered. Finally...

Oxford shakes his head.

She pauses for a long moment...    And then she decides.

Oxford dares to smile, relieved.

He points to a chair by the bed. When Jonson sits down

he notices a big pile of manuscripts by the side of the

bed.

Jonson looks on sadly.

Jonson stares at him.

To answer is not an easy task for Jonson's ego.    He

hesitates.

The two men now looking each other in the eye.

Oxford smiles at the thought of it.   Then--

Then he nods to the manuscripts by his side.

Jonson looks stricken.

He puts the last manuscript on the pile.

Jonson looks at the--

Jonson takes a long time before answering. Will he

betray Oxford?

Cecil doesn't know whether to believe him or not.

Jonson stares directly at Cecil, knowing he is speaking

about Cecil as well as himself.

Cecil stares into his eyes for a long moment, searching

for the truth. Then he smiles.

Robert Cecil turns to leave, but then turns a last

time.

Robert Cecil smiles at Jonson, who can only stare at

him. Finally:

Robert Cecil's smile freezes and he leaves.
