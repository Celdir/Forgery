FADE IN:

EXT. PARIS FRANCE - PONT DE BIR-HAKEIM - DAY

PAUL (50's) stands on the street under a RAISED TRAIN BRIDGE.

He covers his ears in UTTER DISGUST at the UNBEARABLE NOISE a

train makes as it ROARS OVERHEAD.

He BELLOWS TO THE HEAVENS.

As the train moves on he walks, slowly, DESPONDENT. Lost in a

private WORLD OF PAIN.

Behind him we see a woman in a fur collard coat and flowered

hat walking, gaining on him. This is JEANNE (20's).

As she PASSES Paul, she turns to GLANCE at him. We read a

HINT of EMPATHY on her face.

He is OBLIVIOUS to her or anything else for that matter.

She walks on, dodging STREET SWEEPERS as she covers the long

walkway, trying to forget the SAD MAN she saw.

We see her walk toward a 6 story APARTMENT BUILDING.

Paul, with TEARS STREAMING DOWN HIS FACE, comes to reality as

he also notices the building. He REGARDS it.

EXT. APT. BUILDING - PASSEY - DAY

Jeanne stands looking at the grandeur of the building at 1

RUE JULES VERNE. She reads a FOR RENT sign on the door frame.

She HESITATES but then RINGS THE BELL. She checks her watch.

She SMILES to herself then descends the nearby stairs.

She goes into a BAR.

INT. KENNEDY EIFFEL BAR - DAY

Jeanne comes in and speaks to the BARTENDER.

DIALOGUE IS IN FRENCH

Jeanne goes to the TELEPHONE/WASHROOM.

The telephone booth is OCCUPIED.

As she waits, she watches in disgust as an OLD LADY cleans

her DENTURES with a toothbrush and then puts them back in her

mouth.

Jeanne STUDIES her own face in the MIRROR, puffing her cheeks

up in judgement. As she does, Paul exits the phone booth,

still LOST IN ANGUISH.

After watching him leave, Jeanne USES THE PAY PHONE. She

speaks to her MOM.

She puts her foot up on the seat. We see her LONG BOOTS as

her SHORT SKIRT hikes up.

INT. APT. BUILDING - FRONT DESK

Jeanne talks to THE CRAZY CONCIERGE through a SMALL WINDOW

who is SMOKING and has ROLLERS in her hair.

The Concierge joins Jeanne AT THE WINDOW.

She sits at her desk and PUTS OUT HER CIGARETTE.

She looks through her KEYS...

One of the APT. GUESTS puts an empty WINE BOTTLE outside

their door. They both TAKE NOTICE.

Jeanne thinks the place is like a FUNNY FARM. As the

concierge TRILLS OUT FIGARO, she gives up and walks away.

She looks for it.

Jeanne, against her better judgement, goes back to the desk.

She holds out her hand. The Concierge puts the KEY IN HER

HAND.

She GRABS AND HOLDS ON to Jeanne's hand way too long,

LAUGHING CRAZY, HYSTERICAL. Jeanne has to forcefully break

away from her grasp.

She gets free of her and heads to the ELEVATOR, rubbing her

hand.

The ELEVATOR arrives and she gets on. We watch her ascend and

DISAPPEAR.

INT. APT. BUILDING - BEDROOM

Jeanne comes in the DARK ROOM and heads straight for the

window. She opens it and the STORM SHUTTER.

Light STREAMS IN, revealing Paul, sitting on the RADIATOR.

Jeanne is STARTLED when she sees him.

DIALOGUE IS IN FRENCH

No response.

No response.

He replies WITHOUT LOOKING AT HER.

She walks up to the FIREPLACE.

He gets off the radiator and WANDERS into the next room for

SOLITUDE.

LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

But she has followed him. She OPENS THOSE WINDOWS also. He is

forced into ANOTHER ROOM.

DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

As he studies a WICKER CHAISE LOUNGE, she calls from the

other room.

She continues to LOOK AROUND. Her CURIOSITY of Paul gets the

best of her. She peeks around the corner and watches him SIT

IN THE CORNER.

She thinks he is VERY ODD as he PLAYS WITH a lamp shade.

Nature calls. She heads to the --

BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

As the PHONE RINGS, she pulls up her skirt and sits on the

toilet for a PEE. She looks around.

She finishes and FLUSHES THE TOILET as the PHONE RINGS ON

incessantly.

LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The PHONE RINGS on...

They pick up the phone at the SAME TIME. Paul EAVES DROPS

He puts the SMALL LAMP SHADE back. He hangs the receiver on

the back of the chaise. Jeanne continues to listen on her

end, UNAWARE.

Paul SNEAKS AROUND THE CORNER.

LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Jeanne is STARTLED. She hangs up the phone.

She's SPEECHLESS.

He WALKS OFF.

Jeanne picks her hat off the floor, lost in CONFUSION.

The front door SLAMS.

She walks toward the door...

But Paul didn't really leave. He walks slowly TOWARD HER.

He STUDIES HER for a moment. He takes her hat and DROPS IT on

the ground. He PICKS HER UP in his arms and CARRIES to the

window. He puts her down on the window sill. They start

MAKING OUT ferociously.

He RIPS her panty hose, UNDOES HIS ZIPPER and PENETRATES HER.

They are lost in ANIMALISTIC SEX as she WRAPS HER legs around

him.

They KISS SAVAGELY and HIT the floor as THEY CLIMAX TOGETHER.

Totally spent, they ROLL AWAY from each other. Her skirt,

hiked up is showing her ripped panty hose. We can see her

AMPLE BUSH through the SHEER FABRIC.

They WRITHE on the floor trying to CATCH THEIR BREATH.

EXT. APT. BUILDING - ENTRANCE - MOMENTS LATER

Paul comes out the FRONT DOOR. He puts on his TRENCH COAT.

Jeanne LAGS behind, trying to fix herself also.

Paul takes the FOR RENT sign off the DOOR FRAME as Jeanne

heads off, still STUPEFIED.

He watches her descend the stairs and throws the CRUMPLED UP

sign on the sidewalk.

PONT DE BIR-HAKEIM - CONTINUOUS

They go their SEPARATE WAYS. Jeanne crosses the street while

Paul takes the RAISED WALKWAY.

EXT. SUBWAY STATION - PLATFORM

Jeanne RUNS through the crowd IN A PANIC dodging people. She

finds who she is LOOKING FOR, her boyfriend TOM (30's). She

runs into his arms like LONG LOST LOVERS.

All of the sudden, a FILM CREW appears, filming their every

moment.

They KISS PASSIONATELY.

Tom tries to UNTANGLE HER from the cords.

He walks her and EXPLAINS.

He KISSES HER...

They walk on as the SOUND ENGINEER pokes a MICROPHONE in

their faces.

Jeanne SMACKS THE MICROPHONE out of their faces.

He is THRILLED. He tries to kiss her but she won't let him.

She is still MIFFED. But she finally GIVES IN. They have a

PASSIONATE EMBRACE.

INT. HOTEL - ROSA'S BATHROOM - DAY

CATHERINE cleans the bathroom of EXCESSIVE BLOOD.

Paul sits on the other side of the PRIVACY SCREEN --

REFLECTING, in a GLUM FOG, listening.

She WRINGS OUT a washcloth frequently as she speaks. The

EXCESSIVE BLOOD AND WATER falling into a BUCKET.

She WIPES A MIRROR.

She wipes another GLASS SURFACE.

She opens the curtain to the SHOWER/TUB. It's INUNDATED with

BLOOD.

She STARES at the blood... It's so much. She uses the SHOWER

HEAD to rinse the blood off the tub.

She rinses the blood FROM HER HANDS AND ARMS.

Disgusted and exhausted, she sits on the edge of the tub. We

switch to PAUL'S SIDE of the PRIVACY SCREEN. We see he is

DEEPLY DISTURBED by this situation.

She begins to clean blood from THE STRAIGHT RAZOR Paul's wife

used to KILL HERSELF WITH.

Paul pulls the curtains aside from the window. He looks out.

He SPIES a BLACK COUPLE, one a SAX PLAYER, in an adjacent

building. She is attempting ORAL SEX on him.

When the couple are spotted, they stop. He starts PLAYING HIS

SAX.

Paul has had enough of the running water and her cleaning.

Paul walks to her side.

She hands him the STRAIGHT RAZOR. He STUDIES IT.

He grabs her hands VIOLENTLY and studies them.

He tilts her head back FORCEFULLY.

He PULLS HER OUT OF THE WAY and turns off the water. He pulls

the SHOWER CURTAIN closed.

He storms out of the bathroom, leaving Catherine there.

When he is gone, she opens the curtain and turns the water

back on OUT OF SPITE.

EXT. PONT DE BIR-HAKEIM - DAY

Formerly known as the Passy Viaduct. We see a great shot of

the DOUBLE-DECKER ROAD-AND-RAIL BRIDGE and PAUL'S NEW

APARTMENT BUILDING.

INT. APT. BUILDING - DAY

The front door opens and Jeanne's hand comes in, holding the

KEY.

The rest of her peeks in. She SPIES A CAT. She decides to

make CRAZY NOISES at the animal, CRAWLING ON THE FLOOR,

making it RUN FOR THE HILLS.

Just then, MOVERS pop in carrying furniture catching Jeanne

off guard.

He puts the chair down in the middle of the room. She moves

it to in front of the fireplace instead.

She heads to the front door but is stopped by...

With and armfull of chairs.

She tries to leave again but then runs into...

With a table.

BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Jeanne REGARDS the room.

She leans against a wall and looks around, FLABBERGASTED.

We see Paul in the DOORWAY paying the movers.

He comes in.

LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Jeanne is sitting in the chair in front of the fire place.

He DRAGS THE CHAIR AND HER to the window instead.

He takes his COAT OFF and hangs it on a DOOR HANDLE.

He grabs the TABLE and brings it to the DINING ROOM.

DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

He places the table. She FOLLOWS with the CHAIRS.

But he has WANDERED OFF to another room.

DIALOGUE TO ENGLISH

BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

She walks across the mattresses with her BOOTS ON. Paul leans

against the wall STUDYING THE ROOM.

He COVERS HER MOUTH and backs her up agianst a WALL.

She THROWS HIS HAND off and puts some space between them.

She leans against the adjacent wall.

Back to the OTHER WALL.

He indicates OUTSIDE THE WINDOW.

She walks to the bed, inviting him with her eyes.

INT. HOTEL - PAUL AND ROSA'S ROOM - DAY

ROSA'S MOTHER roots through Paul and Rosa's belongings.

Searching for answers... and maybe some tokens of her

DECEASED DAUGHTER.

Paul WAITS, listening in the HALLWAY. He loathes the upcoming

reunion.

ANNOYED by all the RATTLING while she searches, he bites the

bullet and GOES IN.

He CATCHES her in the ARMOIRE...

She stops her ROOTING.

We notice the IRONY of the SIGN ON THE DOOR, it reads "PRIVY"

(PRIVATE).

She walks TIMIDLY up to Paul. After a moment, they EMBRACE

each other in a GRIEF STRICKEN HUG.

Paul grows BORED of the reunion, he TAPS HIS FINGERS on the

closet he LEANS AGAINST, studying the accessories of the

DECOR and her silly hat.

She sits, SPILLING HER GRIEF on Paul as if it is a THERAPY

SESSION.

She starts RUMMAGING AGAIN, this time through Rosa's empty

PURSES, spilling them out one at a time on the bed BEHIND

PAUL.

He takes the purses and PUTS THEM BACK. She sits on the bed

in DESPAIR.

He closes the ARMOIRE.

He GATHERS HER BELONGINGS and leads her UP THE STAIRS.

STAIRS - CONTINUOUS

They pass some GUESTS coming down.

Rosa's Mother stops on the stairway, REFLECTING PAINFULLY.

Paul goes on, IGNORING HER.

ROOM 12 - CONTINUOUS

Paul comes in and puts her belongings on the BED.

Paul goes out to the HALLWAY to gather himself.

Rosa's mother thinks he LEFT. She YELLS.

Paul is BROKEN OUT OF HIS TRANCE... the sudden yelling has

INCENSED HIM.

He PEERS ANGRILY at her in room 12.

He goes into the ...

BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

He turns off the ANNOYING RUNNING WATER. He looks at himself

in the mirror.

She UNPACKS her suitcases on her bed. He rejoins her.

ROOM 12 - CONTINUOUS

She takes out some CARDS.

Paul EXPLODES -- She jumps a foot back.

He DARES HER with his eyes, ENRAGED.

He throws her suitcase AGAINST THE WALL.

He SNATCHES THE PAPER from her hands.

He RAISES HIS HAND threatening to HIT HER.

Scared, she pushes on.

She starts WEEPING.

He PUMMELS THE DOOR with his fists ... ENRAGED...

He closes her DOOR.

HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Some of the OTHER GUESTS pop their heads out to see what the

COMMOTION IS. He gently CLOSES THEIR DOORS in a "mind your

own business" sort of way.

There is always the "Miss know it all, busybody type" though.

She sheepishly REOPENS HER DOOR.

Paul walks calmly back to it and SLAMS IT in her face ---

IRATE.

INT. APT. BUILDING - DAY

Jeanne enters the ALREADY OPEN DOOR. She looks around the

still sparsely furnished living room.

LIVING ROOM -

Paul has decided his BED FITS BETTER in here. The BOTTOM

MATTRESS is on the floor in the MIDDLE OF THE ROOM. He LEANS

AGAINST THE WALL and top mattress, WAITING FOR JEANNE. He

knew she'd be there.

She TAKES A SEAT on the bottom mattress and takes off her

boots.

He watches her and does the same with his shoes. KICKING THEM

OFF and CATCHING THEM in the air PLAYFULLY.

Paul and Jeanne sit NUDE, entwined, WRAPPED AROUND EACH

OTHERS BODY'S.

DIALOGUE IS ENGLISH

They REGARD each other for seconds.

He leans his head back and CLOSES his eyes... SCREWING UP HIS

FACE. She COPIES HIM.

They STOP THE SILLINESS. They laugh. She wraps her arms

around his neck.

Paul does some PLAYFUL ANIMAL SOUNDS. APE SOUNDING GRUNTS and

such. He contorts his face and LOOKS SILLY.

She mimics his idea and makes her own PLAYFUL ANIMAL SOUNDS.

He laughs.

She redoes the SOUNDS for him. He JOINS her. Their ANIMAL

SOUNDS BLEED INTO...

EXT. JEANNE'S FAMILY COUNTRY MANOR - YARD - DAY

... A DOVER OF LIVE DUCKS QUACKING --

Tom and his FILM CREW record the ducks for b.g. SOUND CLIPS

while they WAIT FOR JEANNE.

This includes ROOSTERS, PIGEONS and annoyed NAIL FILING by

one of the CREW.

FINALLY, Jeanne opens the gate door, sheepishly. She is LATE

and has a DIFFERENT HAIR STYLE.

Tom is MIFFED, for continuity sake...

DIALOGUE IS FRENCH

She is much more EXCITED about the NEW PERM.

She CLOSES THE GATE.

He twirls around, setting up the shot between his hands and

his MINDS EYE...

She MOSEYS OFF.

He does.

FAMILY PET GRAVE-YARD - CONTINUOUS

Jeanne kneels in front of a HEAD STONE that reads "Mustapha".

A VOICE from behind Jeanne pipes in.

Jeanne smiles, FAMILIAR.

Jeanne stands and KISSES HER on the cheek through the gate.

We watch Olympia walk to the MANOR HOUSE as Jeanne WAXES

NOSTALGIC. Slowly, the rest of the property is revealed to

us.

A GROUP OF KIDS runs into the yard.

INT. JEANNE'S FAMILY COUNTRY MANOR

Jeanne holds up a PICTURE. She points to people as she

describes them.

Olympia CHIMES IN AGAIN from behind the CAMERA CREW.

The Camera Crew turns the camera on her. Jeanne has a

DIFFERENT PICTURE, pointing again.

They turn back to Jeanne.

Olympia chimes in again from behind, in an open door.

The camera turns on her, then back to Jeanne.

He walks to her.

He turns on his camera crew who is UNDER HIS HEELS, shewing

them out.

He starts opening all the doors in the MANOR.

Olympia is loitering in one of the rooms he comes in. Imagine

her nerve, in her own house!

Tom is the typical RUDE FRENCH DIVA DIRECTOR.

He turns his attention back to Jeanne, the subject of his

OBSESSION.

She closes her eyes. He guides her BACKWARDS by the shoulders

through the MANOR.

Jeanne BACKS TO a ROW OF PICTURES. She touches each and

recalls the subject.

Next picture.

Next.

He starts a COUNTDOWN of ages, as if he is HYPNOTIZING HER.

Jeanne backs into a DESK.

Jeanne kneels down in front of the desk.

She crawls under A TABLE. She finds a NOTEBOOK in a SECRET

HIDING SPOT.

She reads from it.

STUDY - CONTINUOUS

She reads on.

She shows him a PICTURE she has found that she DREW AS A

CHILD.

AS WE --

EXT. BACK YARD

Jeanne and Tom walk BUNDLED TOGETHER as Jeanne REMINISCES...

The FILM CREW follow them, filming.

Olympia stumbles behind, watching.

All WANDER THE GARDEN.

They come upon the CROWD OF KIDS again. One KID is squatting

behind some thatch, doing his business.

The boy pooping stops and PULLS UP HIS PANTS.

Jeanne SCOLDS THEM.

They SCATTER towards the STONE WALL with Olympia and Crew

CHASING AFTER THEM.

The kids CLIMB THE WALL for escape from the CRAZY ADULTS.

Tom wanders back over to Jeanne while Olympia and the Crew

continue to SCARE OFF THE KIDS in the b.g..

But Jeanne is OFF.

AND WE CUT TO--

INT. APT. BUILDING - LIVING ROOM - DAY

We are back at Paul's new place. Jeanne WANDERS THE ROOM

TOPLESS but covering her breasts with a PILLOW.

She continues to WAX NOSTALGIC about her father.

Pissed, she THROWS THE PILLOW she was covering her AMPLE

BREAST with at Paul.

We now see Paul is LOUNGING ON HIS MATTRESS, pant legs rolled

up past his knees, TOYING WITH A HARMONICA and drinking from

a WOODEN CUP.

DIALOGUE SWITCHES TO ENGLISH

She huffs over to the other SIDE OF THE ROOM, crossing her

arms, POUTING.

He turns on to his back to evince his CROTCH.

He PLAYS A TUNE on his harmonica. She sneaks onto the bed IN

THE SHADOWS.

He stops PLAYING THE TUNE.

An IRISH COUNTRY JIG plays over the MONOLOGUE.

Jeanne looks up from the bed, MISCHIEVOUSLY.

Jeanne flaps her arms. Paul TWILLS his eyebrows in response.

Jeanne climbs on the bed with the top sheet like a LIONESS

STALKING her prey.

She COVERS HIM UP with the sheet. Then she uncovers his arm.

She SNIFFS HIS ARM. Paul PLAYS ALONG.

She plays with his hands.

She REACHES UNDER the sleeve of his shirt to his chest.

She lifts the sheet from his face, moves his harmonica and

looks in his mouth.

He TALKS FUNNY as Jeanne holds on to his tounge.

She makes her way down to his CROTCH, uncovering the sheet as

she goes. She REGARDS HIS PRIVATE AREA.

Jeanne SMILES ON as Paul reels off a list of FOREIGN NAMES

for the MALE GENITALIA.

Jeanne gets a kick out of this... Sort of.

Paul MOCKS HER.

He gives her a LOVE SMACK on the head.

Paul explodes.

She SMILES.

Paul is suddenly LOST IN HIS THOUGHTS. He wanders to the

wall, leans on it and studies his harmonica.

Paul climbs a TRIPOD that is leaning against the wall.

He takes the PIN OUT and it comes apart. He FALLS BACK.

He finally looks at her.

DRUM MUSIC STARTS AS...

He smiles, twirls a drum stick, puts his harmonica on her

head and goes into the NEXT ROOM.

She THROWS THE HARMONICA on the floor in disgust.

As he FIDDLE FARTS around the apartment, Jeanne MASTURBATES.

Paul is REUNITED with his SMALL LAMP SHADE. He puts it over

his face and CRIES into it.

Jeanne has CUM. She ROLLS OFF THE MATTRESSES onto the floor,

SPENT.

She ROCKS BACK AND FORTH on her haunches.

A SIREN screams outside. She hugs the wall.

Paul is LOST IN GRIEF, crying harder.

INT. HOTEL - LOBBY

SAX MUSIC PLAYS - from a room in the HOTEL.

It's soothing and nice. Nevertheless, Rosa's mother roams the

room, sleepless, a CROCHET BLANKET wrapped around her. Paul

sleeps on the couch. She covers him with a the blanket,

MATERNAL.

He THROWS IT on the floor.

Rosa's mother reaches out and strokes Paul's arm.

She continues stroking.

He sits up calmly, taking her hand in his own, then... BITES

HER!!!

She PULLS HER HAND BACK in obvious pain.

Paul gets up and TURNS OFF THE MASTER LIGHT SWITCH. Rosa's

mother STANDS, SCARED.

Paul STALKS TOWARD her in the DARK.

He leads her by the ARM to the stairs.

They look up the stairs to all the GUESTS that are out of

their rooms.

Paul turns the lights back on. The GUESTS who are gathered on

the stairs, scurry back to their rooms.

Rosa's Mother stares on as the COMMOTION CLEARS. A GUEST

comes in the front door carrying NEWSPAPERS. This is MARCEL,

(60's) Rosa's LOVER.

He takes off his hat for her.

Paul saunters into the room. He surveys the IRONIC SCENE.

Marcel picks up on the awkward energy. He heads up the stairs

to his room. Paul hands him a key on the way up.

INT. APT. BUILDING - BATHROOM - MORNING

Jeanne, NAKED, roots through Paul's coat pockets. She finds

his RAZOR, but scoots to the sink when she HEARS HIM COMING.

She starts applying makeup and SINGING.

Paul enters the bathroom. He takes his SHAVING ACCOUTREMENTS

(razor, strop, brush, etc.) out of his coat pockets. Jeanne

watches him intently in the MIRROR.

He joins her at the LARGE BASIN SINK. She pretends to have

been putting on her make-up all along. She RESUMES HER SONG.

Paul starts putting his SHAVING CREAM on with a shaving

brush.

He MOCKS her obvious mispronunciation of "whore".

She applies more makeup.

He MOCKS her mispronunciation of "who" this time.

She LAUGHS.

He SHARPENS his razor on the STROP.

He CORRECTS her again.

He starts SHAVING his neck with the STRAIGHT RAZOR.

Paul EXPLODES.

She stands, POUTING.

She hits the sink and TURNS to us, we see her AMPLE BUSH. She

crosses her arms and continues to POUT like a child.

He has finished SHAVING.

He FINALLY NOTICES her pouting.

He throws her over his shoulder. He SPINS HER AROUND. She

screams but goes with it.

She LOVES IT. He puts her down on the sink. She is LAUGHING.

He leaves the bathroom. She slaps the sink top, CHILDLIKE.

INT. APT. BUILDING - FRONT DOOR - A LITTLE LATER

Paul is all dressed. He is ready to leave. We hear Jeanne

from the BATHROOM.

DIALOGUE IS FRENCH

She comes around the corner...

... Just in time for Paul to SLAM THE DOOR IN HER FACE.

She THROWS HER PURSE at the door.

INT. SUBWAY STATION - PLATFORM - DAY

A train enters the station. Tom gets off. He searches for

Jeanne.

When the Train leaves, we see her sitting on a bench on the

adjacent track.

She notices him first.

He starts RUNNING TO THE EXIT.

He FRAMES HER with his fingers.

A train ROARS into the station between them. Jeanne is

ANNOYED.

The train is gone, but there is no one there... Tom is GONE.

Jeanne walks toward the EXIT. Tom appears on HER SIDE of the

platform.

They STALK EACH other like ANIMALS. He SLAPS HER HARD in the

head. She SLAPS him back.

They FIGHT until she collapses from exhaustion in his arms.

INT. HOTEL - MARCELS ROOM - EVENING

Marcel is in his RED PLAID BATHROBE. He sits at his desk,

clipping coupons from a NEWSPAPER.

[OC] KNOCK ON DOOR

DIALOGUE IS FRENCH

Paul comes in. He is in a MATCHING RED PLAID BATHROBE.

He does while Paul ROOTS AROUND.

He takes notice of PAUL'S ROBE.

Paul takes a look at one of the newspapers from Marcel's

desk.

Paul finds this VERY AMUSING.

He sits on MARCELS BED.

He flicks the light on and off as he talks.

He heads to the door.

Marcel stops him.

He takes a BOTTLE OF BOURBON from a hiding place. Paul joins

him. He pours a glass for Paul.

He POURS A GLASS for himself.

He SITS back down.

He points to a spot on the wall above them.

Marcel takes some LIPS SALVE from his bathrobe pocket.

Paul takes notice of the LIP SALVE operation.

Paul regards him for a second.

He massages his own temples.

He paws at Marcel's stomach.

He gazes across the room.

He gets up and heads across the room.

He takes a bar from the floor and slides it into a spot on

the top of a DOOR FRAME.

While Paul has a moment of REFLECTION, Marcel shows him his

PULL-UP LEG KICK combo on his PULL-UP bar.

Paul leaves, DISGUSTED.

INT. APT. BUILDING - DAY

Jeanne comes in carrying her FUR COLLARED COAT, purse and a

BAG.

She looks around the place.

She kicks the door shut with her foot. She wanders to the...

She throws her coat and purse on the table. She puts a

PORTABLE RECORD PLAYER in the BASSINET.

From the other room we hear Paul...

We see that Paul is laying on the floor eating bread.

She STORMS into the kitchen. Paul continues eating.

She comes out and THROWS THE BUTTER on the floor in front of

him.

She sits on the floor and opens a MIRRORED door on a cabinet.

We see PAUL'S REFECTION IN IT.

He laughs at her. She sits on her HAUNCHES, then her ass.

He NODS YES. She knocks on the FLOOR near her.

He crawls toward her. We see Jeanne's reflection in a MIRROR

behind him. He reaches toward the hollow spot. She SLAPS HIS

HAND.

He points to her CROTCH.

He reaches for it but she MOVES AWAY.

He starts to UNDO HER PANTS.

He PULLS THE BUTTER OVER WITH HIS FOOT.

He YANKS HER by the legs CLOSER TO HIM.

He FLIPS HER ON HER stomach, violently. She is not in the

SAME GAME.

He RIPS HER PANTS DOWN TO HER ANKLES.

He gets a HAND FULL OF BUTTER.

He YANKS her pants down enough to put his HAND FULL OF BUTTER

in her ASS.

He SPREADS the butter in her ASS as she STRUGGLES.

He MOUNTS HER, opening his ZIPPER. She STRUGGLES more.

He grabs her arms, stopping her from STRUGGLING as he

SODOMIZES HER.

She is WEEPING.

She CRIES OUT in pain as he enters her.

He smacks her savagely on the back of her head.

Her MUFFLED CRIES.

TEARS STREAM DOWN her face.

He DRIVES IT HOME TILL HE COMES...

He COLLAPSES on her, SPENT as she continues to WEEP.

EXT. PONT DE BIR-HAKEIM - THAT MOMENT

A TRAIN ROARS by on the TRAIN BRIDGE.

INT. APT. BUILDING - LIVING ROOM

Paul is SLEEPING on the floor amidst the BREAD AND BUTTER.

EXT. PONT DE BIR-HAKEIM - MOMENTS LATER

Another couple of TRAINS go by.

INT. APT. BUILDING - LIVING ROOM - LATER

Paul SLEEPS more. On his STOMACH now, with his foot on a

piece of FURNITURE.

Jeanne puts a record on the RECORD PLAYER she brought with

her. She goes to plug it into the FLOOR PLUG but gets an

ELECTRICAL SHOCK.

She looks at him sleeping.

He looks at her UPSIDE DOWN.

He looks at himself in a SMALL MIRROR.

He FLIPS HIMSELF over backwards onto his feet. He walks over

to her and the RECORD PLAYER. He stares down at her.

He sits on the FLOOR next to her. He plugs in the RECORD

PLAYER. He JUMPS as he gets an ELECTRICAL SHOCK. Jeanne is

secretly amused.

He gets the RECORD PLAYING. It's some 70's HIPPY MUSIC.

Jeanne sways to it while Paul reads the JACKET COVER.

EXT. PASSY VIADUCT PARK - DAY

HIPPIE MUSIC CONTINUES

Tom and Jeanne sit, ROMANTICALLY ENTWINED on a SEA WALL while

his FILM CREW films in the b.g.

They sit FACE TO FACE, he holds her shoulders and stares into

her eyes.

He plays with her hair.

As his FILM CREW dolly around them in the b.g., his SOUND

PERSON yells at them.

He puts a LIFE PRESERVER over her.

I'm marrying you.

What?!

I'm marrying you!

You're marrying me?

Yes!

We're getting married?

Yes we're getting married.

No.

Yes.

No!

Yes.

Yes?

Yes.

No.

Yes.

Yes?

No. Are we getting married or not?

I don't know.

She take the life preserver off and THROWS IT IN THE WATER.

Together, they WATCH IT SINK.

EXT. JEANNE'S MOTHERS APT. - PORCH - DAY

JEANNE'S MOTHER beats the dirt off her LATE HUSBANDS MILITARY

JACKET.

INT. LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

Jeanne tries on another of her FATHERS MILITARY UNIFORMS

complete with HAT.

Her mother joins her inside. She carries the FATHERS BOOTS.

Jeanne goes into an ADJOINING ROOM while her mom continues

reflecting, IRONING the JACKET.

She looks up just in time to see that Jeanne has found her

fathers gun and is pointing it in her direction.

She shows her mom a picture she has scrounged up from her

FATHERS WALLET of a TOPLESS NEGRO FEMALE.

She takes off the HAT and JACKET and throws them on the sofa.

She heads to the FRONT DOOR with MOM FOLLOWING, on pins and

needles.

Mom RUNS IN.

She goes out the door...

She RUNS AFTER her daughter.

HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Jeanne is on the ELEVATOR. She sticks her head out.

She shuts the door and HEADS DOWN.

Mom follows her down STEP FOR STEP.

EXT. OUTDOOR SHOP BAZAAR - DAY

Tom and his FILM CREW film Jeanne trying on wedding dresses.

He COUNTS DOWN to the shot.

He does the CLAPPER with his hands.

Jeanne and her HOST OF DRESSERS is lost in her fittings.

They move into the center of the shop.

We get another look at Jeanne's LEFT BREAST as it slips out

of the dress being fitted.

Tom fires off QUESTIONS for film purposes.

Jeanne gives her upbeat EXTISTENTIAL RESPONSES as her fitting

continues.

Tom comes out from under a DRESS.

The fussing on the dress is finished. Jeanne slowly, PUTS ON

HER GLOVES, relishing them.

She STRUTS slowly for all to stare and LAVISH her in her

dress.

Tom is CAPTIVATED.

He wanders out into the street. It is RAINING HEAVILY.

Hes FILM CREW scatters for cover.

They huddle underneath the DOOR of the FILM TRUCK.

Tom has lost Jeanne in all the HUBUB. He is disgusted with

his CREW.

He goes back to the SHOP.

He runs down the street in the rain looking for her.

INT. APT. BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY

Paul comes POINDING in from the rain. He STOMPS the water off

his shoes. He breaks into an IMPROMPTU SOFT SHOE.

He opens the gate to the ELEVATOR and gets on. He pushes the

button. The elevator STARTS UP.

Paul stops the elevator. He SENDS IT BACK DOWN.

We see Jeanne has been waiting on the ADJACENT STAIRS for

Paul. She is still in her WEDDING DRESS.

She implores Paul from outside the elevator.

She stands, PLEADING at the ELEVATOR.

Paul does the EYEBROW TRILL. He opens the elevator so she can

get on.

As it ascends, Jeanne slowly RAISES HER DRESS, revealing NO

UNDERWEAR and her AMPLE BUSH to Paul.

INT. APT. BUILDING - ENTRANCE - MOMENTS LATER

The door flies open. Paul comes in CARRYING Jeanne in his

arms.

He starts doing a JIG AND SONG... all the way to the

MATTRESSES.

He puts her on the bed. She is GIGGLING.

Paul pats her stomach and leaves the room.

DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Paul opens the curtains.

Jeanne's SCREAMS come from the other room. He goes to

investigate.

BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Jeanne screams BLOODY MURDER and points to a DEAD RAT on the

STILL UNMADE MATTRESS.

He PICKS IT UP by the tail. She stumbles over herself to get

away.

He holds it out, OFFERING IT to her. She freaks. She runs to

the other side of the room.

He brings it to her... she continues to BACK PEDDLE.

He points to the ASS of the RAT.

Then points to the HEAD.

He DANGLES IT over his mouth, flitting his tounge, pretending

to eat it. She is gonna HURL.

He holds up the RAT again.

He heads out, then stops and LOOKS BACK AT HER.

He really leaves this time.

He LAUGHS at himself.

Jeanne is a BASKET CASE. She sits on her HAUNCHES, muttering.

She gets up, gets her purse and goes to the door. We see her

ASS through the SHEER FABRIC of her wedding dress.

She gets to the...

Paul is there, WAITING, NONCHALANT.

He PATS HER ASS.

She opens the door but he closes it. She STOMPS into the

HALL.

He walks toward her.

She STOMPS a few more steps toward the BATHROOM.

He THROWS HER OVER his shoulder and carries her KICKING AND

SCREAMING into the...

INT. BATHROOM

Jeanne is in the BATHTUB. Paul sits on the BIDET behind her

with a WASHCLOTH.

She does.

He shoves her head UNDER THE WATER.

She comes up ANGRY.

He SMACKS her with the washcloth on the head.

He SHOVES HER under again.

He HITS HER on the head with her own shoe. She just gets more

ANGRY.

He smacks her in the mouth with the wash cloth, she smiles.

He starts WASHING HER back.

She holds up A FOOT.

He sits on the edge of the TUB and grabs her foot. He takes a

sniff... She pulls it away.

He WASHES her foot.

He puts up the OTHER FOOT to was, he obliges again.

She does. He washes her ASS.

He washes her STOMACH.

She gets out. He COVERS her with a BIG RED TOWEL.

They lean against SEPERATE WALLS.

Paul doesn't like that comment. He needs to TEACH HER another

LESSON. He bites a HANGNAIL.

She STOMPS past him to get them, hands them to him.

She DOES.

He stands FACING the wall and PULLS HIS pants down.

INT. HOTEL - TEMPORARY VIEWING ROOM - DAY

ROSA'S WAKE. Rosa's mother has set up a room in the Hotel as

a VIEWING ROOM for her daughter. She is, as promised,

surrounded by TONS OF FLOWERS.

Paul comes in and pulls up a chair next to ROSA. He turns on

the LIGHT.

He pulls the chair closer to her.

The cardboard box, I found all

your... I found all your little

goodies.

Pens, keychains, foreign money,

French ticklers, the whole shot.

Even a clergyman's collar. I didn't

know you collected all those little

knick-knacks left behind. Even if

the husband lives fucking years,

he's never going to be able to

discover his wife's real nature.

I mean, I... I might be able to

comprehend the universe, but... 'll

never discover the truth bout you.

Never. I mean, who the hell were

you? Remember that day, the first

day I was there? I knew that I

couldn't get into your pants unless

I said... What did I say? Oh, yeah.

"May I have my bill, please? I have

to leave." Remember? Last night...

I ripped off the lights on your

mother. And the whole joint went

bananas. All your... guests... as

you used to call them... Well, I

guess that includes me, doesn't it?

It does include me, doesn't it? For

five years, I was more a guest in

this fucking flophouse than a

husband. With privileges, of

course. And then, to help me

understand you, you let me inherit

Marcel. The husband's double, whose

room was the double of ours. And

you know what? I didn't even have

the guts to ask him. Didn't have

the guts to ask him if the same

numbers you and I did were the same

numbers you did with him. Our

marriage was nothing more than a

foxhole for you. And all it took

for you to get out was a -cent

razor and a tub full of water. You

cheap, goddamn, fucking,

godforsaken whore. I hope you rot

in hell. You're worse than the

dirtiest street pig anybody could

find, and you know why? You know

why? Because you lied. You lied to

me and I trusted you. You lied. You

knew you were lying! Go on, tell me

you didn't lie. Haven't you got

anything to say about that? You can

think up something, can't you?

He STARTS to WEEP.

He COLLAPSES on her, SOBBING.

[OC] We hear a voice.

He starts to the door.

INT. HOTEL - ENTRANCE - DAY

Outside the FRONT DOOR, the source of the voice, a WORN OUT

and OLD PROSTITUTE. She is with her JOHN.

She knocks on the door, INCESANTLY.

Paul opens up.

But the man has LEFT.

She PUSHES him out to the street.

She SHOVES HIM out the door and DOWN THE STREET.

Paul CHASES the man on foot for BLOCKS and BLOCKS.

He finally CATCHES UP to him in a ---

EXT. PARIS STREET - ALLEY - MORNING

The JOHN figures he has gotten away. He reverses his TRENCH

COAT to the appropriate side.

Paul comes around the corner. The John doesn't see any

HOSTILITY coming. But it DOES.

Paul grabs him by the tie and drags him.

The man FIGHTS BACK.

Paul doesn't like that. He ROUGHS HIM UP, throwing him from

WALL TO WALL.

He ends up on the ground MINUS HIS COAT. Paul KICKS HIM IN

THE ASS like a dog.

The man RUNS OFF.

Paul heads back up the ALLEY as the man CONTINUES OFF in the

f.g.

INT. HOTEL - PAUL AND ROSA'S ROOM - DAY

Paul lays down on his TWIN BED with his ROBE on over his

clothes.

We see that his BAGS ARE PACKED.

INT. APT. BUILDING - BEDROOM - DAY

We see that the mattress is gone. Only a pile of sheets and

pillows remain in the room.

Jeanne is on the floor, on her knees, doubled over in SICK

GRIEF. PAUL HAS MOVED OUT.

She WANDERS through the apt., GRIEF STRICKEN, from room to

room. We see only a FEW BELONGINGS left around. Shoes, the

CAT (where was it for the "rat problem"?) and phone.

DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Jeanne RIPS THE SHEET OFF the piece of furniture that has

been COVERED UP all along. We all wondered what was

underneath that was so precious.

It's nothing special. She COLLAPSES in grief again, the

furniture falling on her, she KICKS IT OFF.

INT. APT. BUILDING - FRONT DESK - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

Jeanne talks to the CRAZY Concierge from BEFORE. Her head

STUCK through the LITTLE WINDOW while the crazy woman PUFFS a

cig.

She gives a CRAZY CACKLE.

Jeanne STORMS OUT.

INT. PAYPHONE BOOTH - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

Jeanne is on the payphone in the bar from before. She speaks

to Tom. Still DESPONDENT, tears stream down her face.

She struggles to HANG UP THE PHONE through her grief. She

BREAKS DOWN, closing the door for privacy.

We can SEE HER through the door as she leans on it.

INT. APT. BUILDING - LIVING ROOM - DAY

The front DOORBELL RINGS.

Tom comes in. Jeanne stares out the window. She is BATHED in

sunlight.

Tom LOOKS AROUND in b.g.

He hands her FLOWERS. She REGARDS them.

He circles to her front.

They EMBRACE and KISS.

THAT ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Tom looks around the place.

Jeanne has made her way to the DINING ROOM.

They continue shouting across the apt.

Jeanne holds her ARMS OUT like a bird.

MUSIC RISES as Jeanne pretends to FLY AROUND the apt. from

ROOM TO ROOM making AIRPLANE NOISES as Tom DIRECTS HER.

Tom gets SUDDENLY SERIOUS.

This stops Jeanne in her TRACKS.

They face each other.

He walks slowly toward her. They EMBRACE PASSIONATELY. They

kiss.

He breaks away again, SERIOUS.

He walks backward as Jeanne STALKS HIM.

He STOPS ABRUPTLY.

He walks out to a SHOCKED Jeanne.

But he COMES BACK.

They meet in the middle of the room again. They share a

LOVING HANDSHAKE.

Tom leaves Jeanne to it.

She opens the LARGE WINDOW. We can hear the TRAIN below. She

says goodbye to the apt. emotionally, CLOSING THE SHUTTER,

then finally, the window.

EXT. PONT DE BIR-HAKEIM - DAY

We watch Jeanne come out of the APARTMENT BUILDING. She

climbs the stairs to the RAISED WALKWAY. She is back where it

all started. We watch her a bit.

RAISED WALKWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Jeanne walks, in her own world. A somewhat MORE CONTENT world

now. Back to HERSELF.

We suddenly see Paul. He watches her for a moment before

TRAILING HER. He is more DRESSED UP then we have seen him

previously.

As she walks, he RUNS UP BEHIND her and playfully taps her on

her SHOULDER.

She turns, SURPRISED.

DIALOGUE IS ENGLISH

She stops and stares at him, DISGUSTED by his GALL and over

him.

He doesn't get the hint. He doesn't care what she says. He

presses on PLAYFULLY.

He puts his arm around her as THEY STROLL.

AND WE...

INT. SALLE WAGRAM SALON - DAY

As Paul WAXES ON, we watch a TANGO CONTEST in progress. He

wanders RUDELY between the DANCERS on the DANCE FLOOR,

invading their space and lighting a cigarette.

He reaches the other side of the dance floor where Jeanne

waits for him. She is able to SMILE now at his SHENANIGANS.

He has a real JOIE DE VIVRE about him now that he LACKED

PREVIOUSLY.

She sits down at a GUEST TABLE on the outskirts of the DANCE

FLOOR.

He approaches her table and FEIGNS a GENTLEMAN PERSONA.

He sits down with her. He CLAPS his hands.

A WAITER comes over.

The waiter comes over, he turns to chat with him.

We watch one of the DANCE COUPLES DANCE THE TANGO. We focus

on their LEGS and FEET.

We make it back to Paul and Jeanne and Champagne.

We watch a DIFFERENT COUPLE DANCE.

Paul tries to BUTTER UP (pardon the pun) Jeanne.

She takes a sip from the glass he offers her.

She SLAMS IT BACK.

He kisses her on the cheek.

She PEEKS OUT A SMILE. He may just be WINNING HER BACK OVER.

We watch a COUPLE as the MUSIC STOPS. All the PATRONS CLAP as

the DANCE floor clears.

The PRESIDENT OF THE TANGO CONTEST speaks at a microphone.

More CLAPPING PATRONS.

We get back to Paul and Jeanne. She sits 2 tables over,

POUTING, while he struggles to light his CIG. She holds up

her glass to him.

He starts to bring the bottle to her then stops, gets his

drink and brings it too.

He POURS HER SOME. She holds her glass up.

She holds her glass up again.

She lays her head on the table.

He crouches down. She CLIMBS ON HIS BACK for a ride. He pulls

her on her back onto the DANCE FLOOR, through the TANGO

contest.

The JURY IS in an UPROAR.

The tango President FREAKS OUT.

They LIE ON THE FLOOR... They get back up and FEIGN some

TANGO.

The President comes out on the floor now to them. She GRABS

Paul who had DIPPED Jeanne over the JURY TABLE.

She starts scurrying them off the dance floor.

She continues to SHEW THEM AWAY. And she can hold her own

against Paul's SMART ASS MOUTH.

Paul now GRABS HER and starts spinning and DANCING WITH HER.

He SWEEPS HER UP into his arms.

She struggles and Paul puts her down. She continues to SHEW

THEM AWAY. PAUL CONTINUES TO MOCK HER.

He pulls his pants down and MOONS HER.

door, Jeanne FOLLOWING.

As they get to the door he spins one last time.

He LOSES HIS BALANCE and slips. Jeanne has to catch him.

They sit in some tables in a closed, darkened section. Jeanne

puts her head down on the table in EXHAUSTION.

He CLAPS LOUDLY till she wakes up. He puts on his ENGLISH

ACCENT AGAIN.

Jeanne looks OVER IT ALL.

She COLLAPSES on the table again. He kisses her head.

He's OBLIVIOUS to her seriousness, AGAIN.

She shakes her head NO.

She starts undoing his pants. She starts to PLEASURE HIM.

She continues...

She MASTURBATES him to CLIMAX. She gets up, wiping her hands,

then forehead and LEAVES.

When he RECOVERS and sees her leaving...

She doesn't stop.

She LEAVES THE SALON. He FOLLOWS her out.

He SLIDES DOWN THE BANISTER.

She turns to see him coming. She starts RUNNING NOW.

He still THINKS SHE'S JOKING...

He SLIDES ACCROSS THE FLOOR.

She continues RUNNING. She is FREAKED OUT NOW.

EXT. PARIS STREET - DAY

She is RUNNING on the sidewalk past crowds of people, the

OFFICE OF TOURISM and stores. He is in HOT PURSUIT.

She stops and turns to have a EMPHATIC SILENT CHAT with him.

He still finds this to be VERY HUMOROUS. She grows more and

more SERIOUS and SCARED.

She starts RUNNING again. But she TIRES OUT in a ...

She tries to GET THROUGH TO HIM.

He still DOESN'T GET IT.

He tries to EMBRACE HER.

She THROWS HIM OFF.

He still tries to GRAB HER PURSE. She is ADAMANT.

He keeps trying to grab her purse.

He FEIGNS GIVING UP as she walks on.

She JETS OFF AGAIN and we round a corner...

He keeps his distance on the OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE STREET but

still doesn't get that SHE IS SERIOUS. She tries to explain

it to him.

He BLOWS IT OFF.

She needs to GO WHERE HE IS. She starts toward him TIMIDLY.

He feigns a GRAND GESTURE ushering her free travel.

She TENTATIVELY walks on as he PRETENDS TO ALSO.

She MAKES A BEE - LINE to her MOTHERS APARTMENT BUILDING.

He TAKES OFF after her.

INT. JEANNE'S MOTHERS APT. - LOBBY

He gets himself BUZZED IN somehow.

She is SHOCKED, she backs up to the ELEVATOR.

She is becoming HYSTERICAL now.

She makes her way to the

She gets on the OLD FASHIONED LIFT and SLAMS the door in his

face.

She begins to ASCEND.

He FOLLOWS every floor UP THE STAIRS.

She is calling to anyone that can hear as he STALKS HER.

One FLOOR AFTER ANOTHER...

He trips and STUMBLES up the STAIRS after her.

Finally at the top, he has to REST against the wall.

She MAKES A DASH FOR her moms apartment.

But HE FOLLOWS. He grabs her as she tries to UNLOCK THE DOOR.

She runs across to the NEIGHBORS DOOR and BANGS ON IT.

He tries to REASON with her.

She sees her chance to get back in her moms. She dashes over

and UNLOCKS THE DOOR and flies inside trying to slam the door

shut. It's no use, he FORCES HIS WAY IN.

She HUSTLES to the DRAWER with her FATHERS GUN... Paul is

still at the FRONT DOOR.

He shuts the door and WANDERS IN...

Jeanne stands with her back turned staring down into the GUN

DRAWER.

He LOOKS AROUND THE PLACE, assessing it...

She stares down still, HITTING HER HEAD on the cabinets to

help her make a decision...

Paul finds her FATHERS MILITARY HAT. He puts it on.

He SALUTES HER and CLICKS HIS HEELS together, playing a role.

She is incensed that he has dared touch her FATHERS PRECIOUS

BELONGINGS.

He PLAYS ON.

He REMOVES THE HAT and puts it down.

He walks LOVINGLY toward her.

He ROMANCES HER, runs his fingers through her hair...

She STARES into his eyes... as she TELLS HIM HER NAME...

...THE GUN FIRES...

HE IS SHOCKED BY THE FORCE OF THE BULLET INTO HIS GUT.

The color DRAINS FROM HIS FACE, his eyes get WOOZY...

He can only MUTTER.

He STAGGERS away from her...

He STAGGERS toward the PORCH DOOR as Jeanne watches...

He opens the FRENCH DOORS and STAGGERS onto the PORCH.

PORCH - CONTINUOUS

He LOOKS OUT upon the city, and UP TO THE SKY. He takes his

gum out of his mouth and STICKS IT UNDER THE RAILING.

His eyes register his BEWILDERMENT as he STARES out into the

ROOF TOPS.

We see that he is DEAD -- curled in a FETAL POSITION.

SAD MUSIC RISES

LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Jeanne stands in SHOCK with PAUL'S CORPSE in the b.g.

She mutters to herself the ALIBI FOR THE POLICE.

DIALOGUE IS FRENCH

MUSIC RISES AND SWELLS

THE END.
