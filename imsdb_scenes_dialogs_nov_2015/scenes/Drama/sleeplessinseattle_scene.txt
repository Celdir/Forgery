FADE IN:

CLOSE ON SAM BALDWIN

A card: Chicago.

He's in his thirties.  His neck is pinched into a crisp

dress shirt and tie.  His expression is vacant, faraway.

A breeze blows but he doesn't react to it.  In the

distance the architecture of the Chicago skyline.

And pull back to reveal:

EXT. CHICAGO - A GRAVESITE - DAY

Next to Sam is his son Jonah, age 9.  Sam's hand is on

his shoulder.  As the mourners go past and each takes a

turn shoveling a clod of dirt into an open grave --

CLOSE ON ANNIE REED

Pretty, blonde, animated.  Jeans, a T-shirt, a Baltimore

Orioles hat.

And pull back to reveal:

EXT. CHICAGO ALLEY - DAY

Annie is talking to her boyfriend, a good-looking guy

named SETH.  They're carrying packing boxes into the

house they share in the Old Town section of Chicago.

The same stunning architecture in the b.g.  They go up

the back wooden staircase to the house.

Follow them into:

INT. KITCHEN - DUSK

As they set down the packing boxes and Seth starts to

assemble them.

INT. SAM'S CHICAGO TOWN HOUSE - DAY

An attractive, thirtyish couple, SUZY and GREG are

stocking Sam's freezer with enough Ziploc meals for a

months.  A number of friends and relatives talk quietly

in the living room beyond.  Sam stands alone by a window

that looks into the backyard.  We can see a garden of

flowers -- clearly planted by Sam's wife.

ANNIE'S KITCHEN - SEVERAL DAYS LATER

Packing boxes.  Seth is moving out.

SAM'S OFFICE - DAY

A large modern architectural firm in a Chicago high-

rise.  Lake Michigan out the window.  A large space with

several architects consulting, drafting, etc.  Sam is at

his desk, working.  An older colleague, ROB, comes over

to him.  Rob has a mustache, smokes a pipe; he's kind

but a little stuffy.

On Sam's face.  It's hard to imagine Rob being any more

uptight than he is.  Sam takes some business cards out

of his shirt pocket and reads them off.

He stops, realizing that everyone in the room is staring

at him.  Quickly they pretend they weren't paying

attention.  Someone whispers something to a client.

And hold on Sam for a moment and--

EXT. WRIGLEY FIELD - DAY

Sam, Jonah and Maggie walking toward the field.  It's a

gorgeous day for a game.  They high-five each other.

And cut back to:

INT. SAM'S OFFICE - DAY

As Sam snaps out of it.

INT. CHICAGO TRIBUNE - DAY

The Living Section of the paper.  Annie is blowing her

nose as she finishes telling her tale of woe to her

boss, LAURIE JOHNSON.

She pours Annie a cup of hot water.  Annie pulls a

teabag out of her pocket, puts it into the water.

She smacks herself in the head.

O'HARE AIRPORT - DAY

The X where walkway K crosses with walkway L.  Coming

down walkway K are Sam, Jonah, Suzy, Greg, their son

MACK, and several other friends.

And coming down walkway L is Annie with Laurie and a

couple of FRIENDS from the paper, JUDITH and DIANE.

They pass each other going in diagonal directions and

continue on.

We stay with Sam's group:

overlap:

Sam is shaking his head no as they reach the gate for

the Seattle plane.

Annie's group, as they approach the gate for the

Baltimore plane.

Kissing everyone.  Annie starts toward the plane, loaded

with stuff.

INT. PLANE - NIGHT

Sam and Jonah sitting together as the plane waits on the

runway.  He notices his father's distractedness, reaches

over and takes his hand.  Sam comes back into focus.

INT. PLANE - NIGHT

Annie sitting by herself as the plane waits on the

runway.

She gulps.

EXT. O'HARA AIRPORT - NIGHT

The two planes face in opposite directions, waiting for

instructions.

And now they both start to take off.  In opposite

directions.

And we pull back back back back as the planes take off,

one flying east, the other flying west.

And further and further back as they soar into the air

and leave the frame.

The night sky.

Stars twinkle.

And now tilt down to see the United States.  It looks

like a cross between a satellite photo and a drawing by

Saul Steinberg.

A light goes on in Baltimore.

A light goes on in Seattle.

They are the only lights on the map.

EXT. BALTIMORE SUN BUILDING - LATE AFTERNOON - CHRISTMAS EVE

As Annie comes out of the newspaper building with WALTER

JACKSON, a tall, handsome man who wears a hat.  They're

carrying an armful of Christmas presents.  They're

walking toward the parking lot.

They put the presents in the backs of their two cars and

pull out together.

EXT. A HOUSE IN BALTIMORE SUBURBS - NIGHT

Christmas lights twinkling as the two cars pull up in

front of a comfortable upper middle-class house and park

their cars.  They get out assembling presents.

As they start toward the house.

CLANGING ON THE WINE GLASSES.

AND PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

INT. ANNIE'S PARENTS' DINING ROOM - NIGHT

And the family's at the diner table.  Annie's family is

a completely normally-looking WASP family -- only

everyone is a little eccentric.  Annie's mother BARBARA,

a beautiful gray-haired, fantastically cheerful woman,

claps her hands together.  Her father CLIFF, who's at

the head of the table next to her, gives Annie a kiss.

Annie's brother TOM and his wife BETSY are at the table,

along with cousin IRENE and her husband HAROLD.  UNCLE

MILTON, who's Irene's father and Barbara's brother.

There are about FIVE CHILDREN there, too.

He claps Walter on the back.

Walter sneezes.  And sneezes again.

Annie smiles at Walter.

INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

Walter is sitting on the couch as Cliff shows him slides

of cloud formations in Guatemala.  In the next room

Tom's at the piano and the kids are singing Christmas

carols.

INT. BACK STAIRWAY - SIMULTANEOUS

MAX, one of the children, is teaching Uncle Milton to

burp.

INT. ATTIC - NIGHT

The sound of Christmas carols from below.

The attic is full of boxes and Annie walks through with

her mother.  They come to a dressmakers dummy with a

sheet over it.  Barbara removes the sheet.  A beautiful

antique dress.  A veil sitting on top of the dummy.

Barbara starts to unbutton the tiny buttons on the back

of the dress and remove it from the dummy.

Barbara shrugs, slips the dress off the dummy and Annie

steps into it.

Barbra starts to button the dress on Annie.

She turns to look in the mirror.  The dress doesn't fit

at all.  It's completely lopsided.  One shoulder is

higher than the other.  The waist is in the wrong spot.

The effect is quite comical.

EXT. STREET - LATE

The house Christmas lights sparkle outside, twinkling on

the tree inside, and the warm light spilling out.

It's starting to rain.

EXT. BELTWAY - NIGHT

As Annie drives back toward Washington, D.C.

Raining.

INT. CAR - NIGHT

Annie driving.  Presents on the front seat.  She's

singing "Sleigh Ride" and doing all the sound effects

and clipclops and giddyups.  After a moment, she

realizes she doesn't know all the words and turns on the

radio.

Annie changes the station.

She flips the dial back the other way.

Annie changes the station.

Annie twists the dial back the other way.  We hear a

YOUNG BOY's voice.

Annie's hand lingers on the dial.

Annie shakes her head.

Annie closes her eyes for a moment.

EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

As the car drives along.

INT. CAR - NIGHT

INT. SAM'S HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT

Jonah is on the telephone on the first floor of the

houseboat he lives in with Sam.  He's got the phone cord

coming out of the small first-floor study, and he's

standing near the kitchen end of a large living area

looking out at the back deck, where his dad is sitting

in a deck chair looking out at the sea.

ON ANNIE AGAIN.

INT. BALDWIN HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT

Sam pokes his head in the back door.  He looks much as

he did eighteen months earlier, except that his hair is

a little longer.  He picks up the phone extension.

Sam looks across the room to Jonah.

Sam can see Jonah.  He's frightened.  Sam immediately

feels how upset Jonah is.

Sam is looking at Jonah, who's rooted to the spot he's

standing on.

Sam hesitates.

INT. ANNIE'S CAR - NIGHT

INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT

Sam is very uncomfortable about this --

INT. CAR - NIGHT

Annie smiles.

Annie laughs.  So does Mr.  Fieldstone

INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT

Jonah is smiling too.

Sam and Jonah both talk into their extensions, literally

talking to each other on the phone within their own

house, but also ON THE AIR.

Sam starts across the room towards Jonah, who starts

toward him, both of them holding their phone receivers.

On the wall in the dining area is a pine bench.

He puts an arm around Jonah.

INT. CAR - NIGHT

As Annie listens.  She's softened considerably.

Annie catches herself, covers her mouth in embarrassment.

EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

As Annie makes a turn off the beltway into a rest stop.

INT. BALDWIN HOUSE

We hear the beginning of a commercial.

INT. TRUCK STOP RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Annie walks in, anxious to break the spell of her radio

reverie.  She goes to the counter to order some coffee.

There's a commercial on the radio.  The counter WAITRESS

LORETTA is talking to the customers -- who include a

TRUCK DRIVER at a booth.  HARRIET, a short-order-cook,

is visible through an open window to the kitchen.

EXT. DINER - NIGHT

As Annie gets into her car.

EXT. WASHINGTON, D.C.  STREET - NIGHT

Annie driving toward the house where Walter's parents

live.

And cut back and forth between the car and the

houseboat.  Sam and Jonah are still on the bench, but

Jonah has fallen asleep in Sam's lap.  Sam is stroking

the boy's hair.

Annie is listening now.

Annie coasts to a stop outside a handsome mansion in

Washington, D.C., the motor running.  She's hooked now,

she's not getting out of the car until she's heard it

all.

CLOSER ON ANNIE

realizing she has just said this.  Realizing that it

must mean something but not knowing what.

SHE'S CRYING.

A FIGURE appears at the passenger side window, which

Annie doesn't notice.  She's wiping the tears away with

her hand.

The figure TAPS on the window --

-- and taps again.

She turns.  He's pointing at the locked door.  She

searches for the button.  Finally finds it so that

Walter can open the door.

They start toward the front door, Walter and Annie

carrying presents, an overnight bag of Annie's.

As they enter the house, we hear Silent Night and we see

a Christmas tree, glittering with lights.

A CHRISTMAS TREE GLITTERING WITH LIGHTS

as we pull back to reveal:

INT. HOUSEBOAT - EARLY MORNING

As Jonah opens his presents under the tree and we cut

from gift to gift:

A BROOKS ROBINSON BASEBALL GLOVE which Jonah loves and

which he puts on his hand and keeps on while continuing

to open:

A TIE which mystifies him, but he hangs it around his

neck.

A PLAID SHIRT

A MAP OF THE UNITED STATES -- the kind that's used in

schoolrooms that pulls down from a roller.

And now Sam brings out a long narrow present from behind

the door and Jonah opens --

A NEW FISHING ROD

EXT. HOUSEBOAT - DAY

As Jonah poses with all his Christmas presents -- his

tie hanging around his neck over his bathrobe and new

plaid shirt, his baseball glove, fishing rod -- as Sam

takes his picture.

INT. HOUSEBOAT - DAY (OR POSSIBLY EXT. DECK HOUSEBOAT)

Sam opens his present from Jonah, which is something he

made in woodworking class.

INT. KITCHEN OF HOUSEBOAT - DAY

Where Sam is putting the spices they have -- pepper,

salt, paprika and oregano -- into the spice rack, which

has room for at least twenty more.  Jonah is

methodically making pancakes.

There's a knock on the door.

Sam goes to answer the door.

TWO YOUNG WOMEN are standing there.  Both are wearing

quite a lot of Spandex.  One of them is named LULU.  It

says so on her jacket.  The other is JOBETH.

Jonah nods.

JoBeth nods, and continues to nod as Lulu talks.

She winks.  JoBeth nods.

Sam nods.

Lulu waves goodbye, and she and JoBeth sashay off down

the dock.

Jonah closes the door and turns to Sam.

EXT. LAKE UNION MARINA - EARLY MORNING

Jonah and Sam are fishing off a dingy.

EXT. BALTIMORE SUN - MORNING

INT. LIFESTYLE SECTION - DAY

A large open newsroom-type space with REPORTERS at

computers.  Around the perimeter are glass-partitioned

offices and meeting rooms.  Inside one of the offices is

BECKY, the Lifestyle editor of the Sun.  She's at a

table with Annie, now a reporter for the section, and

two other colleagues -- KEITH and WYATT.  Wyatt is

playing Gameboy.

Becky looks at Wyatt, notices the Gameboy.

Becky is riffling through some papers on the table,

among which are some tearsheets from the Associated

Press wire.

Everyone looks at her.  Apparently she's finished.

Annie is looking at them.  This isn't what she was

talking about at all, although she isn't quite sure what

she was talking about.

A beat, everyone pauses.  Things are a little out of

hand.

Everyone looks at her strangely.

EXT. BALTIMORE STREET - DAY

Annie walking purposefully, followed by Becky, hurrying

to catch up.

INT. BALTIMORE RESTAURANT - DAY

Becky and Annie are having lunch.

She reaches down for her purse.

INT/EXT. REMODEL HOUSE - DAY

A hand reaching down to pick something up -- the Seattle

newspaper, and

PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

Sam carrying the paper down/up the stairs to an old

house that's being renovated.  Jonah, who is playing

Cameboy, is walking along with him.  WORKMEN are active

everywhere.  Dry wall going up, cabinets being

installed, tile being set.

One of Sam's partners, BOB LANGMAN, is walking with him,

and JAY MATHEWS, the on-site supervisor, is waiting for

them in an unfinished doorframe.  Bob is hefty, older,

always eating something dietetic.  Jay is younger and

always wears as little as possible, even in cold weather.

They all nod at each other.  The woman has been a

nightmare.

Sam looks at Jonah --

Sam cuffs him good-naturedly.

He walks away past some workmen, ladders, etc.  and

starts checking the cross-beams in the ceiling over in

another area of the site.  Bob follows after him.  Jay

tosses Jonah a hammer and they start knocking nails into

the wall.

SHOT OF  HOUSEBOAT BEING TOWED BY A TUG DOWN THE RIVER (OR A

SEAPLANE LANDING) - TWILIGHT

EXT. HOUSEBOAT - TWILIGHT

Jonah watching it.  Sam visible in the distance in the

kitchen.

INT. KITCHEN - TWILIGHT

As Sam is busy installing the spice rack.  He marks the

wall, hammers in the nails, etc.

A beat.

He puts in the last spice.

They stand back to admire it.  A beat.  The rack falls

off the wall.

The rack itself doesn't break, but about six of the

glass jars of spices break.

There's paprika and thyme and currying powder, etc.  all

over the floor along with shards of glass.

Jonah bursts into tears.

He picks up Jonah and holds him.

And he holds Jonah as Jonah calms down.  Sam closes his

eyes tight.

INT. A TELEVISION SET OF NEW YEAR'S EVE ON TIMES SQUARE

And pull back to reveal:

INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT

Sam, alone, watching the ball drop.  He's got a bag of

Doritos and a beer.

It's Maggie.

She takes his bottle of beer and pours half of it into a

glass.

He reaches out for her.  She's gone.

And we hear the television set now counting down to

midnight in New York.

INT. NEW YEAR'S EVE PARTY IN BALTIMORE - NIGHT

The same television show counting down to midnight.

Champagne corks popping, etc.

And we see Walter and Annie.

They start to dance.

A beat.

They go on dancing.  It's one of those parties where

everyone looks so happy and so in love.  Annie, however,

looks thoughtful.

ET.  MARINA PARKING AREA - DAY

Sam gets out of his car and starts down the dock toward

his houseboat.  He's carrying a bag of groceries.

In the parking lot is a U.S.  MAIL TRUCK.

EXT. HOUSEBOAT - DAY

Sam approaches his boat and a puzzled look comes over

his face.

A MAILMAN with a sack of mail is standing outside the

front door of the houseboat.  Jonah is signing a receipt

for the mail.

Sam picks up an envelop and looks at it.  It's

addressed to Sleepless in Seattle c/o Dr.  Marcia

Fieldstone, Radio Station KWRS in Chicago.  He's

stunned.  As he signs the receipt:

The mailman starts back toward the mail truck.

Sam and Jonah start toward the door.

INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT

Sam is in the kitchen making dinner.  Jonah is sitting

at the table, reading the letters from the stack they

found by the door.

Jonah rolls his eyes, tosses the letter into a pile of

rejects, opens another.

Sam nods as if this makes perfect sense.

As Jonah hands Sam the picture.

INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Annie and Walter are making love.

JONAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

As Sam puts Jonah to sleep.  Jonah is holding his teddy

bear while this conversation concludes.

He kisses him good-night.

INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Annie and Walter have just finished making love.

Walter falling asleep.

Annie lying in bed, with her eyes open.

She starts to get out of bed.  Puts on a robe.

INT. STAIRWAY - HOUSE

As Annie comes downstairs in a bathrobe.

She opens the door to the street.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

As Annie starts to run down the street.

CLOSEUP OF: ANNIE, RUNNING

And now we widen out to see a misty highway she's running

down.

Past a sign saying: Seattle Approximately 3,000 miles.

Past another sign: Your nerves are shot.

And another: Your feet are cold.

And another: Will you find love.

And another: Before you're cold?

And another: Burma Shave.

And Annie continues to run, and now we see she's running

across a map of the United States -- it's a little like

the one we saw in the beginning of the movie -- it's

like the famous map of the United States by Saul

Steinberg, but instead of being about New York, this one

is about Seattle.

In the distance, at the very edge of the map, we see two

indistinct figures -- a map and a young boy.  They start

to wave at her, very slowly.

Annie's eyes widen.

INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Annie in bed, eyes open.  Walter fast asleep.

She gets out of bed, puts on her robe (just as she did

in the dream sequence).

INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT

As Annie comes down the stairs.

INT. KITCHEN - HOUSE

She turns the light on.

Opens the refrigerator.

Closes it.

Opens it again.  Takes out some milk.

Sits down at the kitchen table with a bowl, corn flakes,

banana.  She's about to assemble it when:

She sees:

THE RADIO

She stands up, turns it on to the station Dr. Marcia

Fieldstone is on.  She sits back down with her corn

flakes.

Annie starts at hearing Sam's voice.

Annie closes her eyes.

EXT. BALTIMORE - PEABODY LIBRARY - DAY

We see Annie's car pull into a parking space outside the

Peabody Library.  Annie gets out of the car.

INT. LIBRARY - DAY

As Annie strides purposefully across the library and

enters:

INT. ANNIE'S BROTHER TOM'S OFFICE - DAY

Annie bursts into Tom's office and walks over to his

desk.  We barely has time to look up.

INT. PEABODY LIBRARY - DAY

As Annie walks through it and pushes the door to exit.

EXT. A DOOR OPENING TO SEATTLE STREET - DAY

Sam and Jay walk out of the Arctic Building onto the

street.

INT. SEATTLE RESTAURANT - DAY

Sam and Jay at the counter.  Out the window, we can see

water.

EXT. HOUSEBOAT - EARLY EVENING

Sam coming home.

INT. HOUSEBOAT - EARLY EVENING

As he enters.  It's very quiet.  Too quiet.

No answers.

He starts to look concerned.

He goes down the hall to Jonah's room.  The door is

shut.  He opens it.

Jonah is sitting on his bed listening to a tape.

Earphones on.  Next to him is a young girl named

JESSICA.

Jonah takes off the earphones.

Sam shrugs, turns to go back down the hall.

Sam closes the door to Jonah's room.

Hold on Sam.

INT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS

As Sam comes downstairs, goes into his office.  Closes

the door.

INT. SAM'S OFFICE AT HOME - CONTINUOUS

He goes to the phone.  Looks up a number in the phone

book.  Picks up the phone and dials a number.

INT. AN UNFINISHED DINNER ON A PLATE IN ANNIE'S LIVING ROOM

- NIGHT

Annie is watching "An Affair to Remember" on television,

tears pouring down her face.  Cary Grant is saying: "Are

you in love with him?" Deborah Kerr replies: "I'm not

now."

She's sitting at the dining room table.  A dozen pieces

of paper litter the table.  Annie's been unsuccessfully

typing a letter on an old Underwood typewriter.

She takes a blast from the wine glass to her right.

Becky leans in, refilling the glass.  Annie begins to

type and sob and look at the TV.

Becky flops on the couch.

Cary Grant says: "How about the top of the Empire State

Building?"

She types in Becky's idea.

Then she takes the piece of paper out of the typewriter,

smashes it into a ball and tosses it up in the air and

into Becky's lap.

Deborah Kerr says: "It's now or never." And Cary Grant

says: "We'd be fools to let happiness pass us by."

Deborah Kerr: "Winter must be cold for those with no

warm memories."

Becky and Annie with tears rolling down their faces.

As Becky reaches for a Kleenex.

INT. JONAH'S BEDROOM

A Kleenex being pulled from a box.  Sam is giving it to

Jonah, who's up.  His hair is mated with perspiration.

A beat while Jonah calms down.

Hold on the two of them as music begins.  Bye Bye

Blackbird.

A beat.

As Jonah cuddles closer MUSIC COMES UP AS WE PULL BACK

FROM THE BED AND...

EXT. ANNIE'S TOWNHOUSE - LATE NIGHT

AS MUSIC CONTINUES.  Annie waves as Becky gets into her

car and rides away.  Annie turns to her doorway and

stops.  She can't go back in.  She needs to walk and

think.  She crosses the street into a little

neighborhood park.  We can see the moon.

EXT. SAM'S HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT

Sam comes out onto the porch.  Flops down in his deck

chair.  The city lights in the background.  Same moon.

The MUSIC CONTINUES.

EXT. PARK - NIGHT

Annie flops down on a child's swing set in the park.

MUSIC CONTINUES.

CLOSE ON SAM

CLOSE ON ANNIE

AND A LONG SHOT OF ANNIE IN THE SWING

As Walter pulls up into the parking space Becky pulled

out of.  Annie starts toward him.

A LONG SHOT OF SAM ON THE BACK OF THE BOAT

Make my bed and light the lights I'll arrive late

tonight, blackbird, bye bye.

FADE IN:

INT. BALTIMORE SUN - DAY

Annie on the phone at her desk.

Annie on the phone.

Annie dialing Sam's telephone number.

Annie hangs up.

Annie at her computer modem.  She's dialing a number.

We hear some beeps.

And now on the computer screen, we see a funeral notice

from the Chicago Tribune that reads: Baldwin, Margaret

Abbott, beloved wife of Samuel, mother of Jonah, June

10, Funeral 10 a.m.  Thursday, Church of the Heavenly

Rest, 110 N.  State, in lieu of flowers contributions

should be sent to Chicago Horticultural Society.  And

then there's a citation: Chicago Tribune, June 12, 1989.

Annie types another entry.

A PRINTOUT OF AN ARTICLE

that Annie's reading.  There's a newspaper picture of

Sam at the dedication of a building site.  It's got that

kind of grainy quality that things have when they've

been transmitted, but you can make out Sam's basic good

looks.

EXT. BO'S SECURITIES/WORLDWIDE - DAY

Annie coming from the street toward a storefront in

downtown Baltimore across the street from the courthouse.

Next door there's a bailbondsman, there are ambulance-

chasing lawyers hanging out on the corner.

The sign on the door reads: "No job too small." "All

major credit cards accepted." And then everything on

the sign is translated into Spanish.

INT. BO'S SECURITIES - DAY

Detective Bo Wheedle, a former cop, sits at his desk

listening to Annie.  He has some papers.

INT. SAM'S HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT

Jonah is watching Geraldo with his babysitter, CLARISE,

17.

Geraldo is talking to a heavily made-up, sexily-dressed

WOMAN.

Sam is coming down the stairs.

Jonah hits the remote control and the channel changes to

the Disney channel as Sam comes into the room, dressed

for his date.

Sam tosses Jonah a letter.

He starts to open the letter.

He starts toward the door.

Sam goes out the door with Jonah behind him, waving the

letter.

EXT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT

Sam stops, takes Jonah by the hand and takes him back

into the house.

INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

As Sam pulls down the map of the United States, which is

hanging over one of the kitchen windows and stands Jonah

in front of it.

Sam goes out the door.  Jonah just looks down at his

letter, his hopes on hold.  Clarise switches the TV back

to Geraldo.

INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Sam sits at a table.  Nursing a beer.  A little nervous.

He looks up and spots:

VICTORIA

walking into the place.  She's attractive.  She waves

and smiles and sits down, orders a white wine spritzer

from the maitre d'.

After a beat.

An awkward pause.

Another pause.

Victoria laughs far too enthusiastically.

We hear a CLICK as the image FREEZES.

SEATTLE DETECTIVE

sitting at a table across the room, having just taken

the picture of Sam we saw frozen, with a miniature

camera.  In QUICK CUTS we see a progression of later

photographs:

SAM AND VICTORIA SIMPLY TALKING.

SAM HOLDING HIS FORK ACROSS THE TABLE TO GIVE VICTORIA

A BITE OF HIS SALMON.

SAM AND VICTORIA SHARING A LAUGH.

INT. BALTIMORE MARKET - DAY

Lots and lots of fish stalls with crabs, etc.  Annie is

walking with Det. Wheedle toward a table you stand at

near the clam bar.

He shows her a good picture of him.

She goes to the next shot.  Sees a picture of Sam and

Victoria in the restaurant, although all we see of

Victoria is her back and mane of blond hair.

Hold on Annie's face.

INT. SEATTLE MARKETPLACE

With its stalls of king crab, but otherwise almost

identical in design to the Baltimore marketplace.

Sam and Jonah walk past the fish stand, Sam looking

around, slightly distracted.

As Victoria comes toward them, with a bag full of

groceries.

INT. HOUSEBOAT - LATER

Sam, Jonah and Victoria are at the dining room table,

finishing the dinner that Victoria cooked.

Victoria laughs a little too hard.

Sam smiles.  Jonah is appalled.

Victoria almost dies laughing.  Jonah's eyes narrow to

slits.

They watch as Jonah pads down the hallway.

EXT. SAM'S HOUSEBOAT - REAR DECK - ON SAM & VICTORIA

They're standing at the rail, talking.

INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT

Jonah has snuck downstairs and is peeking out the window

at them.

Victoria runs her finger down Sam's arm.

Jonah is horrified.

He dashes over to the phone and begins to dial.

INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

A sleeping Annie and Walter are startled awake by the

ringing of her phone.

She puts the phone on hold and gets out of bed.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

As Annie comes in and turns on the radio and picks up

the phone.

Annie takes the portable radio and the telephone

receiver, opens the broom closet and closes herself

inside.

ON JONAH

sneaking glances out at Sam and Victoria as he talks.

Victoria puts her arms around Sam's waist and clasps

them behind him.

ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE BROOM CLOSET, WITH THE TELEPHONE

CORD LEADING INTO IT.

Suddenly Sam happens to look over to the window.  Jonah

ducks down behind the desk before Sam sees him.

EXT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT

Victoria notices Sam glancing back at the house, aware

that he's concerned about Jonah seeing them.

And she moves in to kiss him.

ON JONAH

Jonah peeks up over the top of the desk to check if the

coast is clear and is sickened to see them locked in a

kiss.

ON BROOM CLOSET

ON JONAH

He hangs up the phone and SCREAMS.

ANNIE AS THE BROOM CLOSET DOOR OPENS.

SHE SCREAMS.

It's Walter.

Jonah lying on his pillow, staring up at the ceiling,

wide awake.  Thinking.

INT. JESSICA'S PARENTS' TRAVEL AGENCY - DAY

Jessica is reading the letter from Annie.  She's sitting

entrance level to a charming Seattle townhouse.  Jonah

sitting there.

INT. NEWSROOM - DAY

Annie, at her computer, talking to Becky.

EXT. STREET OUTSIDE JESSICA'S HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER

Jonah and Jessica at the mailbox.  As Jonah opens the

Annie is looking out the window, preoccupied.

Annie turns back to the window, leaving the seatmate,

who in any case doesn't speak English, completely

mystified.

INT. SEATTLE/TACOMA AIRPORT - DAY

Jonah is standing out of the way at a departure gate,

watching Sam as Victoria checks in for a flight bound

for Minneapolis.

Sam looks at Jonah, threateningly.  Be nice or else.

Sure enough, passengers are starting to board.

Victoria waves goodbye and starts toward the jetway.

As Sam watches her go, Jonah looks at him, sticks his

finger in his mouth and pretends to gag.

At that moment, Annie emerges from the jetway right next

to the one Victoria went into and comes toward us.

Sam sees Annie immediately, and is instantly struck by

her looks, her fluidity, her poise.

Annie walks right toward Sam, right past him, inches

from him, not noticing him as she looks for the exit.

Sam continues to stare at her.

Sam and Jonah start toward the exit, Sam trying not to

lose sight of Annie.

Sam is preoccupied with Annie.  She takes a turn that he

doesn't expect.  He's having trouble keeping up, because

he has to wait for Jonah.

He's lost Annie in the crowd.  She's nowhere in sight.

A beat, then Sam heads off to the exit.  Jonah follows.

As they walk into the distance --

Annie drives slowly down the street, looking for the

Baldwins' marina.  She stops, blocking the driveway to

Suddenly she hears a HORN HONKING behind her.  She looks

the street to enter the dock.

EXT. DOCK - CONTINUOUS

Annie walks toward Sam's houseboat.  Nervously.  Goes up

to the door.  Adjusts herself quickly and knocks.  No

EXT. ALKI BEACH - ON SAM AND JONAH

They're down at the water's edge, skipping broken

clamshells, like stones, across the surface of the water.

They're laughing, pointing, counting out the number of

skips, arguing over the merits of each throw.

ON ANNIE

checking them out from a phone booth next to the Snak Shak.

ANNIE'S POV - ON SAM AND JONAH - LATER

They're throwing a football.  Jonah catches it and

starts to pretend to score a touchdown, dodging and

feinting.  Sam tackles him and they tumble together on

the beach.

CLOSE ON ANNIE

watching.  The purity and innocence of this little scene

-- a father and son at play -- is affecting her more

than she ever could have imagined.  Their LAUGHTER

Annie parks across from the marina, starts to get out.

Sam's van pulls into a parking space.  Jonah in the

street.

ON SAM AND JONAH

As they start to get groceries out of the car.

Annie watching.  This is it.  No chickening out this time.

She's come three thousand miles, told lies, the whole

thing.  It's now or never.

Sam and Jonah start toward the gate to the dock.

Annie starts to cross the street, gathering courage and

rightness with every step.

But she STOPS DEAD WHEN SHE SEES:

SUZY

who we remember from eighteen months ago, appearing at

the gate to the marina -- waving, smiling a mile wide --

beckoning Sam and Jonah home like a military wife whose

boys have just come back from the front.  Sam and Jonah

are overjoyed to see her.  Jonah breaks into a run,

nearly leaping into Suzy's waiting arms -- as Sam brings

up the rear, picking up Jonah's sodas which he dropped

when he started running.

ON ANNIE

She comes to a standstill, in the middle of the street.

In shock.  The scene in front of her is too horrible to

bear.

ANNIE'S POV - GATE TO MARINA

Sam catches up.  Suzy -- no less beautiful and vivacious

than she was before -- tousles Jonah's hair, kisses Sam

and hugs them both.

ON SAM, JONAH AND SUZY.

ANNIE

There is such apparent warmth, and joy, and love about

this homecoming that she forget where she is -- in the

middle of the street.  A car HORN blares at her... all

she can do is stare at the nightmare that has unfolded.

She starts to back away -- and that's when she sees --

A TAXICAB

coming right at her, horn BLARING, tires SQUEALING.

Annie starts to jump to the other lane but there's a van

bearing down from the opposite direction.  She steps

back to the middle line.

The cab goes into a skid.  Annie freezes.

Sam heard the noise and turns to see what's going on.

The cab comes SCREECHING right at the CAMERA.

Annie screams.

The cab stops inches from her body.  The van in the

other oncoming lane fishtails to a stop as well.

ON SAM

responding.  He runs from the gate toward the near-

accident.

ON THE CAB DRIVER

getting out of the cab, as other people gawk from the

sidewalk.

Annie, still in shock from her brush with disaster,

hears the Cabbie but doesn't respond.  Stunned, she

turns to see Sam on the other side of the street.  Their

eyes meet.  Sam stops, realizing it's the woman he saw

in the airport.

Annie, totally mortified and humiliated by everything

that's happened, bolts for her car.

Sam wants to run after her -- but there's traffic is

coming past and he can't cross the street.  Annie gets

into her car, starts and pulls away.  Sam stands there,

deflated.

on the heart motif.  They move to a window -- "Broken

Heart" -- burnished metal, with tow cherubs flying out

of the wound in the middle.

They're both in their own worlds.  Then they both start

The two of them hold each other tight.  After a beat:

INT. RAINBOW ROOM - NIGHT

Annie and Walter.  There's champagne in their glasses,

but neither of them has drunk a drop.

Annie is nodding.  She wipes a tear from her face.

Slowly, gingerly, Annie slips the engagement ring off

her finger and hands it to Walter.

No bitterness here.  Both of them trying to be gentle

with each other.

This breaks the tension.  Both of them smiles.

Walter turns to look over his shoulder at what Annie

sees:

INT. TOP OF THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING

After a few beat the elevator door opens on a very

empty platform.

Annie slowly walks out.

She sighs.  Heads for the telescopes.  Looks out at the

twinkling lights below.

She casually turns the telescope and suddenly sees

something on the floor.

Jonah's Seattle Mariners backpack.

She picks it up.  She realizes that it might be...

could be... and opens it.  Inside is a toothbrush and

Jonah's teddy bear.  As she takes out the bear the other

elevator DINGS.

Annie looks up as Jonah and Sam exit the elevator.

And they stop.  There she is.  There they are.  Sam

can't believe it.  It's the mystery woman.

She smiles awkwardly.

Jonah walks over to her.  He puts his hand out.  She

shakes it solemnly.

Sam nods.  Smiling.  Starting to put it all together.

Annie smiles.  Still nervous.  No one knows what to do

next.  Just then, one of the elevator operators CLEARS

HIS THROAT.

Annie nods.

Sam holds out his hand.

Annie slips her hand into his.  It feels comfortable,

natural, right.

He looks at her.

On Annie.

On Sam.

On Jonah.  He makes a triumphant little double-fist

gesture to himself as the elevator doors close.

EXT. THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - NIGHT
