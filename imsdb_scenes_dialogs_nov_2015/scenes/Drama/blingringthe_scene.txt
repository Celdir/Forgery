I am a firm believer in Karma, and

I think this situation was

attracted into my life as a huge

learning lesson for me to grow and

expand as a spiritual human being.

I see myself being like an Angelina

Jolie, but even stronger, pushing

even harder for the universe and

peace and for the health of the

planet. I want to lead a huge                             *

charity organization. I want to                           *

lead a country for all I know.                            *

Have a great day.

Thanks.

I hope you like it here. It always

takes a little time to get settled

in.

Yeah. Ok, thanks, Mom.

It's Fifty.

Oh c'mon.

You want it or not?

Sucker.

Fuck off.

I can't wait to get out of here.

Is your mom away a lot?

Yeah, she goes on trips a lot for

work...

For what?

She has a chain of student tutoring

centers...

And you're at Indian Hills?

Yeah, I know, exemplary student...

That's so cute, I love that dress.

I love Chanel.

Yeah, and the shoes are nice...but

she needs to get some better

extensions...

I know, right? Are those Prada?

No, Dior.

Really?   Hey, what do your parents

do?

My mom doesn't work, my dad works

for a film distribution company,

they do a lot of stuff overseas..

Oh cool, he's in the `biz'..

Yeah...it's cool. I get to go to

screenings and stuff.

Nice...oh she's so cute.

But enough with the patent leather

accessories, they look cheap.

Yeah, totes...

Hey, wanna check some cars?

What's that?

C'mon...

Sweet. C'mon.

No way!

Let's go.

That's crazy.

Yeah, people leave them open with

cash and credit cards...

Look, we got like 400 bucks...

Want a ride?

I love that mix you sent me.

Oh, cool, anytime...

Where are we going?

Wherever we want...

Okay.

Do you know anyone that's out of

town?

Uh, this kid Evan I met online,

their family went to Jamaica, why?

I went into an unlocked house a few

weeks ago and found a bunch of

cash....where does `Evan' live?

Woodland hills.

How well do you know `Evan'?

We met up a few times...he was

pretty hot.

This it?

Uh huh.

Fuck...I think we should get outta

here.

It's fine, it's fine...don't freak

out.

What do you think? It's Balenciaga

Uh, Sure.

Oh, yeah.

What is it.

No way!

What the fuck?

Get in.

Where'd you get the keys?

I grabbed them on the way out.

Hey, call my sister for a bag, will

you, she won't sell to me.

Get in line.

Beccaaaaaa! Yo, slut we're going to

Les Deux, wanna go? Nicki and Sam

are there.

Sure.

Yo, Rob, what's up?

Hey, Chloe - Come on in.

Is Ricky here?

Yeah, he should be around.

Yo, sluts.

Chlooeeee!

`sup...this is my homie, Marc.

Hi, I'm Nicki and this is Sam.

Hey, Marc.

We used to go to school together.

Are they sisters?

They've known each other since they

were like three, they took Sam in,

I don't know what happened to her

mom.

Oh my god, Jude Law totally keeps

texting me...I think I'm probably

going to go meet him later.

Yeah, I'm sure you're really going

to hesitate on that one.

Bitch, you're just jealous.

Suck my dick.

You did text him like fifty times.

I did not.

C'mon Chloe, where's that bottle

service? Let's get that going.

Girls.

Ricky!

Hey, baby, you good? You guys have

everything you need?

Uh huh.

Nicki, there are some photographers

out here for fashion week you might

want to meet.

Fo' sho!

And this dope music manager, and

some of the entourage producers-

we've got a real party salad

tonight.

Ok, let me know if you need

anything...

I'll check with you later, Boo.

Oh my god, that's Paris Hilton.

Yeah, totally, she DJs sometimes...

I literally thought I was going to

die.

Homie...

Yo, bitches.

Dawg, wassup?

I thought you might want one.

Oh, you're the best.

I love your shirt.

Thanks.

I loved her, I really did. She was

the first person I felt like was my

best friend...I loved her almost as

a sister, that's what made this

situation so hard.

Oh my fucking god.

They're her pet monkeys. Hi guys.

Let's get the fuck out of here.

It's fine, it's fine...let's keep

going.

She's so messy.

C'mon, let's get out of here.

You're tripping out. This is fine,

it's ok, why are you tripping out?

C'mon.

Oh my fucking god.

No way, I totally want to go to

Paris'!

Yeah, it was sweet, we hung out in

her night club room...I got this.

Oh my god, no way.

You are so sick! O.G. Motherfucker!

No way, how'd you get in?

Her key was under the mat, it was

so chill, we just walked in.

We can all go back, we just have to

check when she's going out to

something...

Lindsay got another D.U.I... Here

try this vest with that...

What do you think?

Try your hair back.

Yeah, that looks classy.

I don't know if I'd go that far.

Leopard and Zebra - seriously?

What?

Yeah, def, you can't wear zebra and

leopard. You have to choose one.

Ok, fine....at least I don't look

like I'm thirty-five.

Let's go to Paris', c'mon,

I want to rob...

I didn't know what they were doing.

I thought they were my friends...it

all comes back to bad choices, who

you have as your friends, and I

know the truth will come out.

No way!

No fucking way.

That's so chill.

Look at all her Louboutins.

Her feet are big.

"Ciao Paris, Keep the glamour

alive! Un Bacio, Donatella."

Sweet.

Look at these!

We could sell these.

Let me see!

Oh shit!

What's all over her?

Some bad tanner...

What do you think?

It's Herve Leger.

What?!

There's actually an old dog turd in

here.

Ew, put that back.

C'mon let's get the fuck out of

here.

Alright, alright...in a sec.

Oh wait, you have to see her night

club room.

Ciao!

Keep the glamour alive!

Man, I was off the charts, it was

craaazzay - they didn't know how I

was driving let alone still alive.

That's fucked up.

Yeah, I have to pick up trash for

fucking forever...

That sucks...

What are you guys doing later?

I don't know, there's a party at

Madison's...I'll let you know,

lates.

C'mon Teacup.

You can't take her dog.

She likes me...and I could probably

get like five hundred for her.

Come on Rebecca, leave her dog, it

would be too noticeable anyway.

Yeah, I guess... bye Teacup.

Shut the fuck up.

Oh shit.

We were acting insane, but it all

felt so glamorous and wonderful.

What are your favorite hot spots in

L.A.?

Hot spots? Well, we love Lola's, we

go there all the time, it's a

Martini bar, and I like the Dime,

and we always go to Les Deux, cause

all our friends are always

there...it's like the spot to go

to.

So have you toned down the partying

since you have a boyfriend?...

Uh, well, sure, a little...

Oh my god, I literally love

Audrina's style...can you see where

she lives?

She's going to Demi & Ashton's

Oscar party Sunday.

Perfect.

Wait. Who are you?

This is my little sister, Emily.

Oh. How old are you?

Thirteen.

C'mon.

Can you fit through there?

I'm staying on look-out.

I like this Rick Owens jacket.

Did you hear that?

It's fine, it's fine.

I think I heard someone.

There's no one outside, calm the

fuck down.

I hear helicopters.

We're in L.A., there are always

helicopters...don't be such a

little bitch.

Ew, what are these oils for?

Gross.

What's Alprazolam?

Xanax.

Oh good...

Jesus Christ, let's hurry the fuck

up.

Her husband.

Ok. What else?

Her hot bod.

Ok, the bod is not a

characteristic.

How long do we have to do this for?

Until we're finished with this and

then we're going to do some flower

essence work.

Who is it?

Water delivery.

Ok, back to work.

Orlando Bloom's shooting a movie in

New York, he's there with Miranda

Kerr.

I want to get some Victoria Secret

model clothes.

Let's do it.

You guys.

What the fuck are you doing?

I've got a new room at my Dad's in

Vegas, I need some stuff to

decorate it, I might stay with him

a while...here, hold this.

Are you fucking serious?

If I ever became not your friend

anymore, would you rob me?

I would never do that to you.

Who are you wearing?

I'm wearing Armani Privee.

And the jewelry?

My jewelry is by Chopard.

And what about your shoes?

Louboutins.

Well, you look beautiful, are you

excited for tonight?

Thank you, yes, I'm so excited to

be here.

Marc?

Oh one second, Mom.

It's time for dinner.

Ok, I'll be right there.

Hey, Chloe.

Yo Home Skillet, what's going on?

Did you talk to Ricky about the

Rolexes.

Yeah, yeah, he's got connects,

bring them by later.

We look to the universe and Divine

Spirit to show us the way. I am so

grateful for this opportunity to

have dinner together as a family.

And so it is.

And so it is.

So, how did your audition go?

It was alright.

I think it went really well, they

said they want to do a test shoot.

That's good, that's good.

What's it for?

Axe body spray.

Uh huh.

And we have a go-see for the BCBG

runway show!

Great! That's a cute top, is that

new?

Oh, yeah, our friend Marc, he's a

stylist, he let us borrow some

stuff for the auditions.

Oh, that's nice.

Yeah, his dad has a production

company he helps style for.

Oh, what's it called?

I don't remember.

Something -international?

Mom, can I be excused?

Are you done?

Yeah, and I want to finish my

flower essences.

Ok, sweetie. I'm thinking about

doing a silent retreat.

Good luck.

I think that's great, honey.

Uh, Mom, we have to get going,

we're meeting this manager tonight

who could be really helpful.

Yeah, He knows a lot of

photographers...and producers.

OK, OK, that sounds good. Just be

back by eleven.

Uh huh.

Yeah, right.

Eleven. It's a week night.

(Under her breath with a chuckle)

Eleven my ass.

I know, I'd totally do him....but

did you see how small his hands

are?

Ew, no.

Yeah, that could be gross.

Yeah.

Dude, we have to get in that

video...Does this look good?

Yeah, I mean, do you feel good in

that?

I just want to look hot, but not

desperate.

Totally. I think you look hot. Let

me see a different top...

Does my butt look good in these

jeans?

Your butt looks awesome.

Ricky, you remember Marc.

Sure, sure I do. Come on in, Marc.

What can I do for you.

Can you sell these?

Where'd you get them?

Uh...I found them.

I see.

What do you think, can you take

them?

I don't know...I can see...tell you

what, I'll give you five grand for

them.

Aren't they worth more?

Not stolen ones.

Ok, yeah. Thanks.

Sure, kid.

When we went out, we got in

everywhere and everyone loved

us...and we had so many beautiful,

gorgeous things.

How many times have you guys been

up here?

I think this is like the 5th time.

And she never noticed?

We never take enough for it to be

obvious...and c'mon, it's Paris

Hilton.

She's so messy.

I know, right?

Here we go.

Oh, shit.

C'mon, let's get the fuck out of

here.

Or you could wear the Chloe sandals

with this.

Oh, yeah.

Turn on KTLA.

What?

Now.

No fucking way, no fucking way.

Calm the fuck down, they can't tell

who it is.

Oh my god.

Oh, shit.

It's fine, it's fine, you can't see

who it is.

Audrina Patridge posted this on her

web site, asking for anyone who has

any information about the break-in

to contact police at the number

below.

Oh my god.

Oh shit.

Is everything alright in there?

Yes, Mr. Hall, sorry if we're

making too much noise.

Everything's fine.

OK.

I'll probably go over to Sagebrush

later...

Cool, who's playing?

I don't know, I think some local

bands...

I want to go to Rachel Bilson's,

she's in Paris for fashion week.

Don't you think you should chill

out a little bit?

Yeah, that news thing totally

freaked me out.

Nothing happened, there's no way

you can tell who that is...C'mon,

will you find her house for me,

please?

I want some Chanel...

I don't know.

C'mon, you're my best friend,

please. Let's go get some stuff.

She has so many Chanel bags.

I love this one!

That's so cute.

What are you doing in there?

When you have to go, you have to

go.

Are you fucking crazy? How are you

so relaxed?

Oh fuck, someone's here.

Don't freak out, let's go you guys.

Hello? Hello?

Oh my fucking god.

That was so close!

Everything's cool, c'mon.

Hi.

Hello.

You guys wait here, I'll get the

car.

That was fucked up.

I know!

Look a Mademoiselle bag! How cute

is this?!

That's so cute. Did you get me one?

I think the biggest problem was

after the Audrina thing-nothing

happened-it gave Rebecca that self-

boost that, oh, this is okay. I can

get away with this. And I think

her projecting that onto me made me

think that it was going to be okay.

Yo, Becca.

Yo.

I heard you went to Paris Hilton's.

Yeah.

And you took some stuff.

That's so dope. Paris Hilton...

Lates.

Whores!

Chloooee.

Where've you been tonight?

We went to Rachel Bilson's house.

No fucking way!

Yeah. It was chill...

Sick!

You went to Rachel Bilson's?!

Yeah, she's in Paris at fashion

week. We just went in...

Shut the fuck up.

When are you coming back from

Vegas?

I don't know, I'm just going to

stay with my dad until things calm

down with my mom...I need a change

for awhile, I'll call you from

there. Will you hold on to some of

my stuff for me?

Yeah, sure.

Why do you think Rebecca was so

obsessed with these women and their

clothes - enough to steal?

We knew he was out of town through

the internet, you'd google his name

and see "Orlando Bloom is shooting

a movie, he's with Miranda Kerr in

New York." We walked in, it was

unlocked, there was no alarm.

The door was unlocked?

Yeah, I've never even broken a

window.

How did you find the Rolexes?

We found a safe at the bottom of a

closet with the Rolexes and like

five thousand dollars...I'll give

everything back that I still have,

and I'll find a way to repay them,

I'm really sorry about what I did.

Did you know Rebecca was leaving

the state?

I just thought she was going to

stay at her dad's cause she wasn't

getting along with her mom and step

dad.

You didn't know she was crossing

state lines with stolen property,

and leaving you holding the bag?

I thought she was just visiting her

dad.

Do you know why we're at your home

serving a search warrant?

Yes.

Why do you think we're here?

My friend Marc was arrested and he                  *

called me from jail and told me the

police had done a search warrant at

his home.

Do you know why?

I've been watching TMZ and they've

been saying I'm a `person of

interest' in these burglaries.

Were you involved in any of the

burglaries to these celebrities?

No, I wasn't.

Is there going to be any property

from any of those burglaries in

this residence?

No.

Have you been in any of the

celebrity's homes that have been

burglarized?

No.

Could any of your fingerprints of

DNA be found in any of the victim's

homes?

My mom does a lot of things, she's

a minister, she's been a masseuse,

she's an energy healer...My dad is

a director of photography on T.V.

shows, he's been in the industry

forever....

And how is Sam related?

We've adopted her, we met in ballet

class when we were little.

I was friends with her mother--

Mom, this is my interview. I met

her when my parents divorced. Now

she lives with us, my mom's home

schooled us all for a while.

The philosophy of `The Secret',

it's based on the law of

attraction, but my great-

grandmother and grandmother both

studied this philosophy. It's man's

relationship to the Divine, that's

what energy science means.

Since I was young I learned about

every religion.

So, Sam was in your ballet class,

did she have parents?

She had a dysfunctional background,

we both did...

And I met her mom--

Can I talk please?! The reason we

related so well is my dad is a

recovering alcoholic and Sam's mom

is..

A practicing...

A practicing drug addict and

alcoholic and our moms became best

friends and...

And then she went off the deep end,

she was on the verge--

Please! I told you that if you're

going to be here you had to be

quiet! That's why I didn't want you

here because you talk!

So, basically you took her in.

Yes, we took her in about 6 years

ago.

But let's get back to Nicki.

So Adam here told me you do charity

work.

Yes, we do a lot of stuff through

our church, it's Agape Church.

It's the religious science

philosophy being taught at Agape

Church.

My other sister, Gabby is on a trip

with them now helping build homes.

And they do a yearly trip to Africa

where they build wells and schools

for kids.

Which country?

Members of the Bling Ring were                     *

sentenced today for their roles in                 *

the rash of break-ins that netted                  *

more than three million in high-end                *

goods. Rebecca Ahn and Marc Hall                   *

were both sentenced with four years                *

in state prison, Chloe Taynor and                  *

Robert Hernandez will face one year                *

each, and Nicolette Moore was                      *

sentenced to six months in county                  *

jail.                                              *

Were you nervous you were next to

her because you were accused of

being a part of that group that

allegedly robbed her house.

Yeah, it was hard for me there were

tabloids and on T.V.s in there

people were watching the story and

they were showing the surveillance

video and stuff... and little do

people know that when that video

came out I was actually in contact

with her manager to tell her who I

believed the people were who robbed

her house... and eventually when

I'm able to tell my story people

will know the truth.

So that's nerve wracking she could

think you robbed her house.

She could've, but you

know...yeah...Anyway, you can

follow everything about me and my

journey at Nickimooreforever dot

com.
