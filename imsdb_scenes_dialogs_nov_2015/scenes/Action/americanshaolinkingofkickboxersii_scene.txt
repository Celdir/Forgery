EXT. NEW YORK CITY SKYLINE  NIGHT

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF THE NEW YORK CITY SKYLINE AT NIGHT, THE LIGHTS

OF THE CITY SHINING BRIGHTLY.

EXT. WORKOUT AREA  SAME NIGHT

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF MASTER KWAN'S SCHOOL, A RAMSHACKLE BUILDING IN A

BURNED OUT ROW OF STORES.

His is the only one still    occupied, and it doesn't look that

permanent. In the window    is a cardboard, handwritten sign that reads

"Kwan's Shaolin Kung Fu".    What remains visible behind the poster and

the security grate is an    IMPRESSION of people moving and milling

around.

INT. WORKOUT AREA  SAME NIGHT

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF KWAN'S SHAOLIN KUNG FU SCHOOL.

The students are doing their own thing, and they are a mixture of old

and young, men and women. They are not dressed alike, as they would

be in a Karate school: they are dressed in old T-shirts and tattered

sweat pants. This is not a wealthy school, by any means, and that is

typified by the appearance of SIFU KWAN, who is walking through the

students as they train. He is wizened old man, 70 years old if he is

a day, and he is dressed in a fraying Chinese jacket, scruffy cloth

shoes and a discolored Chinese T-shirt.

ANGLE ON A YOUNG ADULT

Struggling through a horse stance, his face in real pain. He is

trying his best to hold the stance, but his legs are quivering. He

drops out of the stance onto his knees. Master Kwan is right beside

him.

Sifu Kwan shakes his head and puts his hands behind his back as he

walks past the student.

He walks on, leaving a puzzled student behind.

ANGLE ON KWAN

As he walks around the different people training. As one woman is

moving through an intricate series of movements, he sighs and

rearranges her hands.

He    moves on, studying the room with his eyes, often glancing toward

the    door, and then toward the small clock on a table near the door.

It    is late, and Kwan is obviously waiting for someone to arrive. As

he    is waiting, a young STUDENT comes up to Kwan.

The boy shrugs    and then    starts throwing side kicks. Kwan   is half

looking at the    boy and    half looking towards the door and   the clock.

The boy throws    three or    four kicks and then stops. He is   watching

Kwan watching    the door.    Kwan sees him, and turns back to   him.

He continues to kick, and Kwan continues to look at the door.

Finally, the student stops kicking, half-heartedly bows to the

master, and then moves to the side of the workout room. Kwan doesn't

know he's gone. Kwan turns around, forgetting for a moment what he is

doing, and comes face to face with the mother of a student, MRS.

RODRIGUEZ, and she is holding a uniform of some sort. She smiles

widely at him and holds up the uniform. It is beautiful, obviously

hand made, and on the back is embroidered: "Kwan's Shaolin" and

underneath that is "Drew Carson". Kwan takes in the entire outfit,

while the rest of the class is gathering around to have a look. They

are all very impressed.

This last he says looking at the empty door.

He looks again at the door, then claps his hands together, gathering

his students around him.

During my time training at the Shaolin Temple, the birthplace of the

martial arts, I was lucky (glance at Mrs. Rodriguez)... er...

fortunate to have the best instructors in the world train me. But,

there was also time for individual training  where skills were honed

like the blade of a sword. Now, it is that time for you.

He turns to go.

One of the students, before he can leave, clears his throat.

The others mutter "No" and shake their heads, confused.

He exits, leaving his students staring vacantly after him.

They look at each other, honestly not knowing what to do.

EXT. DREW GARAGE  SAME NIGHT

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF OLD GARAGE.

It is kind of spooky, and there are no lights on outside. There is

candlelight inside, and it is moving around  an effect not unlike a

ghost carrying a candelabra.

INT. DREW GARAGE  SAME NIGHT

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF INTERIOR.

The area is dilapidated, but very clean, with all kinds of kung fu

and Chinese paraphenalia lying around. Around the corner comes the

spooky light, and (with music building to a crescendo), we see DREW

CARSON, a    muscular 16/17 year old, bowls of flaming wax on his bare

shoulders,    moving through the garage, practicing his kung fu

maneuvers.    He is kicking, punching, etc., occasionally spilling hot

wax on his    skin (INSERT).

In the background is a TV, and on it is showing a martial arts movie.

ANGLE ON KWAN

Who is quietly settling into a shadowy corner of the garage, watching

Drew.

ANGLE ON DREW

As he continues to move around the workout area, his arms and body

moving as he tries to match the movements on the TV.

Suddenly, Kwan jumps out of the shadows, attacking. Drew reacts

instantly, evading the attack, the wax sloshing around in the bowls

but not spilling (INSERT SHOT HERE). Kwan continues the attack, and

Drew evades, their movements matching the movements on the TV almost

move for move. It is a beautiful ballet, and Drew ends it by sweeping

Kwan down to the ground. When Kwan hits the ground, hard, his face is

lit by the TV screen.

ANGLE ON DREW

Who, for the first time, sees that it is Kwan.

He hurries over to his master, a concerned look on his face.

He leans down to help Kwan up, forgetting about the bowls of hot wax.

It pours down on Kwan, scalding him, as well as running down Drew's

chest. Kwan struggles to get up, while at the same time trying to

wipe the hot wax off.

DREW

Is taking the glued-on cups of wax off his shoulders, while peeling

the already hard wax off his chest.

Kwan shakes his head and walks over to Drew, standing in front of

him.

Drew starts to protest, but Kwan doesn't even let him start.

Drew holds out his hand for the tape, and Kwan slaps it into his

hand. Drew smiles a defeated smile and turns toward the VCR, when

Drew's stepfather, BOB, walks in. He is a big, overweight man, and he

is very angry.

It is a threat, one that Bob almost takes up. Kwan feels the tension

in the room, and starts to say something.

REACTION SHOT OF KWAN

Closing his already opened mouth.

He spins and kicks one of the hanging bags, then walks out of the

workout room, leaving Bob and Kwan standing alone.

Kwan looks at Bob, who towers over him, and smiles sheepishly.

He starts to walk out, but Bob follows him.

Kwan exits, and we...

EXT. TREVOR ESTATE  DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF TREVOR GOTTITALL ESTATE, A HUGE PALATIAL SPREAD.

The grounds are immaculate and huge, exquisitely kept and beautifully

laid out. A gathering is around the pool and lawn area, where TREVOR

and his team are having an exhibition for their guests. Polite

applause is

COMING FROM THE CROWD, ALL WELL-DRESSED AND OBVIOUSLY WELL-HEELED.

ANGLE ON TREVOR

As he knocks out an opponent.

ANGLE ON CROWD

Applauding.

ANGLE ON TREVOR

Taunting a different opponent. Trevor executes a beautiful technique

and puts the guy down and out.

ANGLE ON TEAM

(Psychologist, therapist, masseur, etc.) who are cheering Trevor on.

ANGLE ON TREVOR

As he plays with the next fighter.

He knocks the guy out with a picture perfect kick. There is no

denying that he's a superior fighter.

The next guy comes up, but before they can start, the psychologist,

DR. PFEELGUT, calls for "Time" and motions Trevor over.

Trevor listens to this, nods his head once, and when Pfeelgut goes to

leave, Trevor pushes him into the pool.

Pfeelgut comes to the surface, smiling.

Trevor goes back to the ring. He really takes it      to this guy,

alternately playing with him and hurting him. As      the guy tries to

hold his own, the string to his pants comes loose      and they start to

fall down. He grabs for them with both hands, and      Trevor starts to

back up, laughing with the rest of the group.

ANGLE ON PFEELGUT

Toweling off, who is yelling to Trevor.

Trevor looks at him for a moment, not really understanding, then sees

what the psychologist is saying. He lunges immediately forward and

(in SLOW MOTION) knocks the guy out while he is still trying to pull

his pants up.

ANGLE ON CROWD AS THEY ENJOY THE SHOW IMMENSELY

Trevor has learned the lesson of the day, and he walks off.

INT. TREVOR HOUSE  SAME DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF TREVOR BEING PAMPERED BY HIS ENTOURAGE

The masseur is massaging his shoulders, a woman is doing a pedicure

and another is doing a manicure. An exercise physiologist is going

over a computer print out with Trevor, when an old Korean master,

MASTER KIM, comes into the room.

Trevor indicates a seat near him, much lower than the one he is

sitting in. The Korean master prefers to remain standing.

The butler, CHAUNCY, comes forward and walks up to Master Kim.

The masseur nods and adjusts his technique accordingly.

EXT. COLISEUM  DAY

People are streaming into the large building. The marquee out front

reads "Diamond Nationals".

INT. COLISEUM  SAME DAY

ESTABLISHING MONTAGE OF TOURNAMENT: CROWDS AND COMPETITORS.

(SOME IDEAS, NOT IN ORDER)

Competitors warming up (wall front stretch, very high; one guy

ANGLE ON DREW AND KWAN

Walk into the area  Drew is dressed in the ill-fitting handmade suit

by Mrs. Rodriguez. People recognize him as he walks past.

ANGLE ON TREVOR

Making his entrance. He is in a perfectly laundered and pressed suit,

and his assistant is carrying another suit pressed and ready to go.

ANGLE ON TREVOR

As he wins a fight.

ANGLE ON DREW

As he wins.

ANGLE ON TREVOR

Drew watching, as he wins again.

DREW AGAIN

Winning. The stage is set for the finals.

ANGLE ON THE RING

Drew and Trevor are already inside, waiting. Drew fights in a mish

mosh of gear (different colors, different makes), while Trevor is

decked out in designer, personalized gear.

The referee gives them a signal and the fight begins. Drew is holding

his own, but Trevor is scoring. After several flashy moves, the round

is over.

Score: 6 - 1. We see Trevor's cheerleaders cheering.

ANGLE ON TREVOR'S CORNER

Where he is given mineral water to drink, his shoulders are massaged,

etc.

ANGLE ON DREW'S CORNER

Kwan sheepishly offers him a sip of water from a battered paper cup.

2nd round: Drew's getting beaten worse than the first round. Nothing

he tries works. The score at the end of the round is 15 - 4, in favor

of Trevor.

ROUNDBREAK

Drew is exhausted, frustrated and worried. Trevor is pumped and ready

to go on forever.

ANGLE ON TREVOR'S CORNER

The psychologist is exhorting him to destroy Drew. Trevor leans back

on his padded stool, smiling.

The 3rd round starts. In this round, Trevor is destroying Drew,

making him look ridiculous. A clinch comes, and

(INSERT HERE) before they can break, Trevor grabs the drawstring

around Drew's waist and pulls.

They face off ("20 seconds" comes the call), and Trevor charges. As

Drew blocks, his pants begin to sag. Trevor, not trying to score,

just trying to keep Drew's hands busy, keeps coming.

Drew's pants drop lower and lower.

When they get around his knees, he finally notices them, and reaches

down to get them. Trevor drives and picks him up in a throw,

effectively showing Drew's bare ass to the world.

CUT AWAY to crowd laughing, girls shocked, cameras poised and

recording, one mom puts her hands over her daughter's eyes, etc.

Trevor dumps Drew and scores the final point, just as time runs out.

A buzzer goes off, signaling the end of the round.

Trevor thrusts his fists into the air in celebration. Drew tries to

crawl out of the ring, and everyone is watching him.

ANGLE ON TREVOR

As he is being interviewed by tv reporters.

Crowd laughs, Trevor's entourage laughs the hardest.

ANGLE ON DREW

As he packs up his stuff.

EXT. NEW YORK BRIDGE  NIGHT

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW AND KWAN WALKING ALONG A BRIDGE, THE ENTIRE

NEW YORK NIGHT SKYLINE IN THE B.G.

They are not talking, they are just walking, Drew kicking a can and

contemplating the future, and the past.

INT. KWAN HOUSE  SAME NIGHT

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF SMOKING ACUPUNCTURE NEEDLE, ITS TIP EMBEDDED IN

DREW'S FOREARM.

Kwan's hand COMES INTO FRAME and flicks the needle, sending it

vibrating back and forth.

CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL Drew sitting at the table in Kwan's

house, the acupuncture needle in his arm and his face pensive and

sad. Kwan busies himself around the needle, trying to alleviate the

pain of Drew's bruises.

He pauses, and decides not to tell another Shaolin Temple story. Drew

looks at him funny  this is very against his character.

He pauses, and takes a sip of tea, checking the needle, adjusting it

and turning it slightly this way and that.

Kwan smiles with the memory  it is a sweet and heroic one.

He pauses again, looking at Drew. Drew meets his gaze, wondering why

he is telling him this story.

Kwan takes the needle out of Drew's arm, and then rubs the spot where

it was with a cotton ball.

He watches Drew, who is pondering what Kwan has said.

Drew nods, an idea forming in his head. A slight smile forms on his

face. Kwan was expecting him to be angry, he never expected this.

Kwan feels Drew's forehead. A long beat here as Kwan studies Drew's

eyes.

He starts to get up, but Drew grabs his arm and forces him back down.

Kwan looks at him, realizes he's serious. He nods his head, giving

the idea serious consideration. He smiles along with Drew.

Kwan touches Drew's bruised cheek, fatherly love in his eyes. Drew

nods his head, then bows in the traditional Chinese manner.

EXT. CHANG AN LU  DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW RUNNING ALONG BEIJING'S CHANG AN LU, A SEA

OF BICYCLES AROUND HIM.

Bicycle bells ring loudly as figures dressed in the same drab clothes

ride around him, their faces covered with scarves and surgical masks

against the northern China dirt.

CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL TIAN AN MEN SQUARE and the huge photo of

CHAIRMAN MAO on the front of the Meridian Gate of the Forbidden City.

Drew continues his run, past a group of western-dressed lyou mang,

who watch him run by through dark glasses.

Drew runs through a large city park, stopping to watch a group of

older citizens going through Tai Zhi routines under the weeping

willow trees there.

Drew runs through an open air food market, picking his way through

flipping fish, dead frogs and all kinds of fruits and vegetables.

People yell at each other, trying to get the best price. Young man

brushing his teeth in the street. A group of toddlers, strung

together with rope, walks down the street, their split pants showing

glimpses of bare bottoms as they walk.

EXT. TRAIN STATION  SAME DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF SERIOUSLY OVERCROWDED TRAIN, PEOPLE PUSHING AND

SHOVING TO GET ON.

Drew walks up to it, a huge backpack on his back. He hesitates a

moment, then starts forcing his way onto the train like everyone

else. He manages to get in through a window.

INT. CROWDED TRAIN  SAME DAY

There are no seats. Drew takes his pack off and sits on it.

Next to him is an old man, his teeth red and rotted from betel nut

juice. The man smiles at Drew.

EXT. CHINA COUNTRYSIDE  DAY

INT. LUOYANG TRAIN STATION  DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW GETTING OFF THE TRAIN.

him into motion. Drew walks on, passing a sign that reads "Luoyang".

EXT. CHINESE STREETS  DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW MAKING HIS WAY TOWARD THE SHAOLIN TEMPLE.

He stops at    a drink stand and orders one. As soon as he stops, he is

ringed with    people watching his every move  he feels almost like a

movie star.    The woman in the stand hands him a drink, and takes the

money out of    his hand.

The woman just smiles and shakes her head, not comprehending.

ANGLE ON DREW

Walking aimlessly. He comes to an intersection and sees a sign that

says "Shaolin Temple" with an arrow. He goes in the direction that

the arrow points.

EXT. GIRL'S SCHOOL  SAME DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF GROUP OF GIRLS STANDING OUTSIDE THEIR SCHOOL.

Drew walks up and says hello.

They titter with laughter, covering their mouths with their hands.

Drew is not really amused, however, he is frustrated and tired.

ANGLE ON ASHEMA

As she pushes her way to the front of the group. She is a strikingly

beautiful young woman.

Ashema translates this for her friends, and they titter anew. They

gesture to Drew's longish hair and laugh, and then make some attempts

at martial arts movements.

She pulls out her standard-issue black bicycle  she has customized

it, however, with some colorful additions.

Drew does, and they take off, the girls from the school tittering as

they drive off.

EXT. CHINESE STREETS  SAME DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF ASHEMA PEDALING DREW.

It is not the most stable ride  Ashema is struggling to keep moving,

while Drew is doing his best to stay on the bike.

EXT. CHINESE STREETS  SAME DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW PEDALING ASHEMA.

He is riding strongly, and she is comfortable in the back. They are

getting stares from the people they pass, but Ashema seems to be

enjoying the attention. Drew hits a bump, and Ashema holds his waist

a little tighter. Neither of them mind  in fact, Drew starts looking

for more bumps.

He pulls around the corner into a wide area lined with drink and food

stands.

DREW STOPS THE BIKE AND LOOKS BACK AT HER. ASHEMA GESTURES TO THE

TEMPLE FRONT, AND DREW TURNS IN AWE.

EXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE  SAME DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF THE TEMPLE.

This is it  the temple he came halfway around the world to see. The

Shaolin Temple, the birthplace of the martial arts.

Ashema climbs off the back and takes the bike from Drew, marveling at

his awe-struck face.

They wave at each other, and Ashema pushes her bike off.

Drew turns back to stare at the front of the temple. He is letting it

all sink in.

After a moment, he picks up his backpack and heads for the front

door. He pulls it open and disappears inside.

INT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE  SAME DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF TEMPLE INTERIOR AS DREW OPENS THE HEAVY DOOR.

The muted half light inside is in direct contrast to the sunlight of

the day outside. Drew quietly closes the front door, and the half

light takes over.

He walks through the temple proper, and what follows is a MONTAGE of

temple shots, establishing the feeling of the

temple:    the famous Shaolin monk painting, the depressions in the

floor of    the training hall, the incense blackened walls of the

temple,    the temple figurines, the red lanterns hanging from the

ceiling,    a huge wooden carving of

Bodhidharma, etc.

No one is around.

Drew continues to explore, looking for someone to talk to. He wanders

into another hall, following the O.S. sounds of CHANTING.

Once inside this hall, he sees a group of monks, amid hanging incense

burners and paper lanterns, sitting down on the floor chanting in

rhythm. No one notices that Drew is standing there. The monks eyes

are open, but they don't seem to see him.

He stands there for a moment, then shrugs and walks out of that hall.

He goes into a corridor, then passes the "Wooden Man Chamber".

HE STICKS HIS HEAD IN, AND SEES ALL KINDS OF WOODEN STATUES LINED UP.

HE ALMOST STARTS IN, BUT IS DISTRACTED BY THE SOUNDS OF TRAINING

OUTSIDE (O.S.). HE WALKS OUT IN SEARCH OF THE SOUNDS.

EXT. TRAINING AREA  SAME DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF TRAINING AREA.

All manner of training equipment is standing outside (wooden men,

posts, hanging targets, heavy bags, iron palm jugs, balance beams,

etc.).

A monk, the DRILL SERGEANT (hereafter D.S.), is standing in front of

a wooden post, driving his hand into the wood.

The post TREMBLES with every strike.

Drew stands next to the monk, watching him intently. Again, the monk

takes no notice of him.

No answer.

Still no answer. The man is just slamming his hand into the post,

over and over.

Drew sighs and walks on. He goes down a path, and flowering bushes

are on either side of him. He can see the "pagoda forest" in the

distance. At the end of the path, a monk, SAN DE, is sweeping up the

path.

Drew walks up to the monk and bows.

No answer nor response. Drew's kind of tired of this treatment.

He walks off frustrated, wondering what he has to do to get noticed.

He walks back into the chanting chamber.

INT. TEMPLE  SAME DAY

The monks are still chanting. Drew stands there, listening some more,

moving with the beat, until they stop chanting.

Drew, thinking it was some kind of performance, claps his hands.

The monks finally take notice of him, and they are shocked.

Several monks rush up and start herding Drew towards the exit.

Drew stops their progress and makes sure he has the monk's attention.

The monk stops, his face a mask of shock. He calls to another monk,

and they have a short conversation in Chinese.

Drew starts to sit down, intent on staying, almost like a kid who is

going to hold his breath until he turns blue.

He continues in a stream of Chinese, and the other monks grab Drew

and physically force him to stand up and start moving him towards the

door.

Drew is forced through the courtyard to the front door.

They pass the monk who was sweeping up in the back of the temple. He

watches with interest as they open the door and force Drew through

it, out of the temple.

He smiles.

EXT. SHAOLIN COURTYARD  SAME DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW LANDING ON THE FLAGSTONES OF THE COURTYARD

WITH A THUMP!

A group of people stop and watch the foreigner. The temple door

closes with a solid boom.

The temple door opens again, and out comes Drew's backpack.

It lands next to him, but spews out a couple of pairs of underwear,

and some socks.

The people standing around laugh.

Drew gathers up the clothing and stuffs it back into his pack. He

sits there for a moment, then gets up and heads for the small shops

and stands ringing the courtyard.

He walks past a couple of the stalls, looking at the people running

them. He doesn't see Ashema. He passes a tea stall, where one old man

is sitting down sipping his tea.

The old man looks at Drew and smiles, and Drew is about to walk on,

when Ashema stands up from where she was squatting behind her stall.

Drew sits down heavily, putting his pack down next to him.

Ashema places a cup of tea down in front of him, the steam rising

from it.

EXT. TEMPLE STAND  EVENING

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW, ASHEMA AND OLD MAN, STILL SITTING AT THE

TABLE, NOW LIT BY CANDLES AND A LANTERN.

A bunch of tea bowls are scattered in front of Drew, as if he's been

drinking heavily. He points to his teacup, and Ashema shakes her

head.

Drew's shoulders slump even more.

The old man talks to Ashema for the first time. He chatters in

Chinese, motioning towards Drew.

The grandfather keeps talking, even though Ashema and Drew really

don't want to listen.

Ashema says something to him, and he continues in Chinese.

Drew sits there, thinking, letting it all soak in. He then gets up

and smiles.

The grandfather smiles at him, nodding his head.

Drew shakes his head.

He starts away from the stand.

He walks off into the Chinese night.

EXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE  EARLY MORN

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF MIST-LADEN COURTYARD.

The sun is barely coming up, and only a few shafts of light are

illuminating the darkness. A figure can be seen sitting cross-legged

in front of the door.

It is Drew, backpack at his side.

The front door opens and a monk pokes his head out to look around,

and he sees Drew sitting there. His eyes widen in shock, then he

quickly disappears inside.

Almost immediately, the door opens again, and the Admissions Monk is

standing there, surprised and angry to see Drew sitting there.

No response from Drew. He just sits there, staring straight ahead.

Drew doesn't move.

San De, the sweeping monk, walks out of the open door, a monk behind

him carrying a suitcase. He walks past Drew, noticing him sitting

there. He walks on.

The Admissions Monk slams the door, angry.

EXT. TEMPLE  MONTAGE SECTION

ANGLE ON DREW SWEATING IN THE HOT SUNSHINE

Sweat is running into Drew's eyes, and he is trying to keep them from

stinging.

with his hair and his clothes, touching the things in his backpack

(frisbee, football, walkman), etc.

ANGLE ON DRILL SERGEANT

When they are gone, he turns to Drew.

It lingers for a moment, then goes away.

ANGLE ON DREW BEING FED BY ASHEMA

She is giving him food, and all he is moving is his mouth. They do

not speak.

ANGLE ON DREW SITTING IN THE RAIN

He is miserable, and he is looking at the relative comfort of the

stands around the temple, where there is food, warmth and light. His

spirit is wavering.

ANGLE ON DREW BEING FED BY ASHEMA AGAIN

No response from Drew. Just a small smile.

ANGLE ON SPIDER, WHO IS BACK

This time it stays even longer. Drew looks down at it and smiles.

ANGLE ON MONKS FROM TEMPLE

Looking out the windows at the crazy foreigner in their courtyard.

ANGLE ON DREW IN COURTYARD

As a school group comes through the temple.

The children are tied together with a rope, and the teacher motions

to the crazy American. Drew has become an attraction!

ANGLE ON DREW, SURROUNDED BY OLD MEN

They are marveling at his perserverance.

ANGLE ON DREW, WIND AND RAIN

This time it doesn't seem to bother him so much.

ANGLE ON DREW WITH ASHEMA AND HER BAU BAU THERE

Bau Bau speaks quickly in Chinese.

Drew nods.

ANGLE ON DREW SURROUNDED BY KIDS

They are no longer tormenting him, they are playing around and with

him. Drew is not moving, but he is part of their group.

ANGLE ON DREW, THE SPIDER NOW SITTING ON HIS HAND

Drew stares at the spider, his companion in the vigil.

ANGLE ON DREW, BIRDS ALL AROUND HIM

The birds are keeping him company, and they are singing for him.

ANGLE ON DREW, THE FULL MOON IN THE B.G.

Drew's form is firm and solid, the determination in his eyes easily

seen as he stares at the moon. He will see this through.

EXT. TEMPLE  DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW STILL SITTING IN THE COURTYARD.

The    old monk, San De, comes back, the same monk following behind him

with    the suitcase. He looks at Drew, a little surprise showing in his

face    at seeing the American still there. He doesn't stop, though. He

goes    into the temple, shaking his head.

ANGLE ON DREW

Same as the first shot, all alone in the temple.

EXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE  SAME DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF COURTYARD, DREW ALL ALONE.

The door to the temple opens and out comes San De, alone this time.

He walks over to where Drew is, stares at him for a moment, then sits

down across from him.

Drew tries not to look at him.

San De runs his hand across his bald pate and smiles.

Drew, in shock at his ability to speak English, sputters

San De shrugs it off. Apology accepted.

San De nods.

Drew opens up his hand to reveal a spider sitting in his palm.

San De, watching Drew intently, smiles at this last. He stands up and

bows to Drew. Drew bows back, from his seated position.

San De turns and goes into the temple, leaving Drew still sitting in

the courtyard, the setting sun in the b.g.

EXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE  DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF COURTYARD, DREW ALL ALONE.

O.S. comes the sounds of gongs and drums.

A crowd has gathered in the courtyard. Ashema and her grandfather are

in the crowd, and they work themselves up to where Drew is.

Drew turns his head, and a procession of kids about his age (some

older and some younger) come walking into the courtyard.

The front door to the temple opens wide, and a column of monks, all

in their best saffron robes, are lined up waiting to receive them.

The young men who are walking in all still have hair, and they are

carrying some baggage. They begin to enter the temple.

Drew, very concerned, watches as the monks-to-be file through the

temple doors.

The mothers and fathers of the boys watch proudly as the last ones go

through.

The temple doors close.

ANGLE ON DREW

Who is crushed. His chance is gone.

Drew is sitting there, trying to understand what is happening when

the door to the temple opens again. The Drill Sergeant appears in the

doorway and impatiently motions for Drew to come in.

The crowd has stopped and is watching the drama unfold.

Drew gets up warily, expecting some trick.

The Drill Sergeant motions again, wanting Drew to hurry up.

Drew looks at Ashema and her Bau Bau and smiles. He picks up his

backpack and starts towards the temple, limping from sitting for so

long.

The crowd goes crazy, clapping and yelling.

Drew runs into the temple. The door closes behind him.

INT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE  SAME DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF INTERIOR OF TEMPLE.

The line of disciples has stopped, waiting for Drew. Drew, back pack

in hand, takes his place at the end of the line.

They parade past a line of monks assembled in the courtyard inside

the temple.

As they walk by, some of the monks look nonplused, while a few are

put out by the fact that Drew is among them.

Several of the disciples turn around to look at Drew, and a couple

are openly hostile to him.

They file up to a raised platform, on which stand 20 monks, each

holding a scroll in their hands, one monk for every new disciple.

A gong sounds, and the questions begin.

ANGLE ON FIRST DISCIPLE

Who is asked...

ANGLE ON DREW

The monk pauses, for that is not the ritual answer to the question.

The Drill Sergeant comes up to him and whispers in his ear, and the

monk then continues.

The Drill Sergeant comes up behind Drew and WHACKS him in the side

with his elbow.

ANGLE ON ANOTHER DISCIPLE

ANGLE ON DREW

The Drill Sergeant nods his head.

Drew pauses, looking at the Drill Sergeant. The D.S. nods, urging him

on.

The D.S. puts his hands over his eyes.

Then, another gong sounds, and the quizzing is concluded.

A figure moves down a corridor in beautiful robes. Everyone bows

down, their eyes on the floor, to the figure, who is moving towards

the raised platform in the center.

Drew, also bowed down, sneaks a peak at the figure.

It is San De!

San De catches his eye and smiles slightly. He winks at Drew, then

clears his throat.

Everyone stands up again.

ANGLE ON DREW

Who now knows that the monk he called a "Janitor" is the headmaster!

The DISCIPLE next to him, GAO, pokes him sharply in the ribs.

Gongs go off, firecrackers are set off, and a special flag is raised

on the flag pole. A roar comes from the crowd outside.

ANGLE ON THE DISCIPLES

All of whom are happy. All, that is, except for Gao, who is staring

at Drew.

Drew, notices the stare.

ANGLE ON SAN DE

When the noise subsides.

San De walks away, and the disciples are split into several

"platoons". Drew is matched up with the Drill Sergeant, and Gao is

also in his group.

They are motioned to follow Gao out of the courtyard and into the

temple proper.

INT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE  SAME DAY

Drew walks behind the other disciples, who are lining up to get their

robes. As he takes his place in line, a monk comes up to take Drew's

backpack. Drew resists, and a tug of war ensues.

The Drill Sergeant sees the scuffle and walks over.

He walks away, and Drew reluctantly gives up his backpack.

Drew lines back up, and is about to get his robes, when Gao slides

over and takes them from him. Drew immediately shoves him and tries

to grab the robes back. Gao smiles and moves away, holding the robes

up and away from Drew.

Drew is pissed and ready to go after Gao. Before he can, however, LI,

another disciple, grabs another set of robes from the table and gives

it to Drew, pulling him away from the confrontation.

They both smile and walk off.

INT. TEMPLE  SAME DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF MONKS HAVING THEIR HEADS SHAVED.

THE CAMERA MOVES DOWN the line of monks, as their hair is shaved off

in clumps. Drew is standing next to his chair, arguing with the D.S.

about the haircut.

The D.S. shakes his head, and Drew sits down, unhappy.

The barber starts on Drew's head, big clumps of hair falling down to

the floor.

EXT. SHAOLIN COURTYARD  EVENING

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF MONKS, THEIR HEADS NEWLY SHAVED, STANDING OUT IN

THE COURTYARD.

They are running their hands over their heads. Drew comes out of the

building, his head shaved completely clean.

He rubs his hand over his head, and then sees the others.

Li is smiling.

INT. DORM  NIGHT

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF THEIR SLEEPING QUARTERS, AS THE MONKS FILE IN,

LED BY THE D.S.

A number of cots are lined up side by side. The D.S. has assigned a

bed to each monk. Drew finds his bed, which is right next to Gao's.

Drew unconsciously smells himself. He shakes his head.

Li goes up to the D.S. and points to the bed he was assigned.

D.S. nods, and then starts for the door.

Gao collects his stuff and starts off to the new bed, hitting Drew

with his shoulder. Drew trips him as he walks away, all done very

secretively since the D.S. is watching.

Li comes over to the new bed, and in silence they get climb into

their respective beds. D.S. switches off the lights, then leaves, and

Drew stares up at the ceiling.

Drew waits for a moment, fearful that the D.S. will be coming back

in. He doesn't.

ANGLE ON DREW, SLEEPING

All is quiet.

Suddenly, a huge stick ENTERS FRAME, and it pauses for a moment above

Drew, before THUMPING down on top of him.

Drew cries out when he is hit, and jumps out of bed, looking all

around him. No one is there. A few of the disciples are moving around

because he yelled, but there is nothing else there.

Drew, belatedly, gets into a fighting stance, but no other attack is

coming.

ANGLE ON GAO

Who seems to be sleeping peacefully.

ANGLE ON DREW

As he climbs back into bed, bone-weary. He lies back down to sleep.

INT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE  MORNING

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF LATRINE.

Drew stumbles in, bleary-eyed,    to relieve himself. He stands at the

urinal, relaxing as he starts.    Suddenly, a huge stick WHACKS Drew

across the rear end, the SOUND    reverberating through the latrine.

Drew yelps and jumps, looking    around for the attacker.

No one is there, and his underwear is now all wet.

INT. DINING ROOM  SAME DAY

ESTABLISHING TIGHT SHOT OF RICE GRUEL ("WATER RICE"), A SPOON

STIRRING THE MEAGER MIXTURE.

CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL Drew sitting with Li and some other

disciples.

Drew makes a face.

The D.S. comes up behind and grabs the bowl from him.

He takes the bowl away.

He turns to the rest of the disciples.

A chorus of Yeahs.

INT. DORM ROOM  SAME DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DORM ROOM, ALL THE DISCIPLES CHANGING INTO THEIR

WORKOUT CLOTHES.

They are the standard fighting monk issue  suitable for martial arts

training.

When they are all dressed, they run out of the room.

EXT. TRAINING AREA  SAME DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF ALL THE DISCIPLES LINED UP, READY FOR THE

TRAINING.

In the b.g. are the fighting monks, going through their routines.

ANGLE ON FIGHTING MONKS

As they go through forms or free sparring. There are SHOTS of monks

throwing stars, working with weapons, etc. It is all very exciting.

ANGLE ON DREW

Who is more excited than all the others.

ANGLE ON THE D.S.

As he walks to the front of the group. In his hand he is carrying a

shovel.

D.S. Bodhidharma, the patriarch of the Shaolin Temple taught us that

to train the mind, we first have to train the body.

ANGLE ON WU, WHO SHIELDS HIS MOUTH AND WHISPERS

ANGLE ON D.S.

Who motions to one of the monks behind him, who has a wheelbarrow

filled with shovels.

D.S. motions with his hand, and in the distance is the latrine

building.

The D.S. leads the way to the latrine building, and the disciples

follow, each of them carrying a shovel. Drew is trudging along, not

believing what they are doing.

LATRINE WORK AREA  MONTAGE

MONTAGE SEQUENCE OF WORK DETAIL.

ANGLE ON DREW AND THE OTHER DISCIPLES

Digging with their shovels. Their training clothes are already

sweated through and dirty. Their shirts are off, and their arm

muscles are bulging and shining in the hot sunshine.

ANGLE ON DREW

As he lifts up two heavy buckets of dirt on a pole, then places the

pole on his shoulders, the muscles in his arms, shoulders and back

straining. He walks off to the side of the area to dump it.

As he dumps the dirt, a pole appears and CRACKS across his back. He

drops the buckets and falls to the ground. He gets up as quickly as

he can, but there is no one to be seen.

ANGLE ON DREW AND DISCIPLES

As they are working hard on the latrines. Drew is teaching them an

American song as they work.

The monks are singing along with him. All except for Gao.

ANGLE ON DREW AND DISCIPLES AS THEY EAT THEIR LUNCH

It is again very meager: a bowl of rice, a bowl of soup and a piece

of scrawny meat. Drew looks at it for a moment. The

D.S. is standing over his shoulder.

Drew shakes his head and starts to eat, quickly.

ANGLE ON DREW

As he loads up a two baskets of dirt onto his pole. He gets it up

onto his shoulders, in pain, and starts to walk. Immediately, the

D.S. is there in front of him.

He examines the baskets. They are not full.

He moves quickly and dumps both baskets of dirt.

ANGLE ON GAO AND THE DISCIPLES

As they are in line for water. They each drink a large glass full,

then move back to their work area. Drew is the last in line. When

Drew gets to the front, the D.S. smiles and shakes his head.

Drew stares at all the water spilled onto the ground, then looks up

at the D.S., then forces a smile. He takes the proferred buckets of

water (made of wood, with pointed bottoms and large handles). The

D.S. indicates that they are to be held straight out to the sides, to

work on the shoulder muscles. Drew turns and walks away, muttering to

himself.

Gao is laughing as he watches Drew go.

EXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE  SAME DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW FILLING THE BUCKETS IN THE STREAM.

Once they are filled, he starts back for the temple. His shoulders

are straining from the weight of the buckets.

He goes over the path to the temple, having to negotiate logs over

chasms, etc. After various trials and tribulations, Drew arrives at

the temple, his arms incredibly tired. The D.S. is there waiting for

him.

Drew, determined not to show any weakness, raises the buckets a

little bit higher. He comes to the D.S., proud and defiant. The D.S.

motions for him to put the buckets down.

Without thinking, Drew, puts the buckets down, and they both fall

over, spilling their contents onto the ground. Drew tries to stop

them, but he's too late. The water has all spilled out onto the

ground.

INT. DORM ROOM  NIGHT

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DISCIPLES ALL IN BED.

They are exhausted from their work. Drew is lying in bed, his eyes

wide open, ready to get attacked.

ANGLE ON DREW

As his eyes go closed, finally.

EXT. WORK AREA  DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW WALKING ON A RIDGE BETWEEN TWO LARGE HOLES,

CARRYING HUGE BASKETS OF DIRT ON HIS POLE.

He is balancing as he walks.

ANGLE ON GAO

Who is working at the other end. He starts across the same ridge.

They come to the middle: a stand off.

Gao smiles and shakes   his head. Gao starts forward, and WHACKS Drew

in the leg with a leg   sweep. Drew tries to keep his balance, and

fights a valient, but   losing battle. He falls over the side, the dirt

in his buckets flying   everywhere. Gao wipes his hands off and

continues walking.

CLOSEUP ON DREW'S BLOODY HAND

A huge splinter sticking out of it. He is in real pain. The D.S.

walks over and looks at the splinter, and in one move pulls it out.

He walks away.

ANGLE ON DREW AND THE DISCIPLES

On a work break. They are watching the monks training in the

distance. It is all the more desirable because it is unattainable.

In the distance, a monk can be seen walking between two other monks.

They are leading him out.

The monk continues walking until he walks right in front of the

disciples. His face and body are covered with bruises and welts. The

two other monks don't say a word, their faces grim.

Li turns to the D.S.

The D.S. walks off.

The D.S. appears and motions for them to work.

INT. MEDITATION HALL  DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DISCIPLES, DREW IN THE MIDDLE, SITTING IN ROWS

IN THE INCENSE-FILLED MEDITATION CHAMBER.

The monk in charge of the chamber is talking to them.

Drew sits, trying to think of nothing. He is not succeeding.

INT. DINING AREA  NIGHT

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW WASHING DISHES, ALONE IN THE KITCHEN AREA.

He bends over to get a dish, when a pole comes and SMACKS him on the

rear end. He turns immediately in one direction, but gets hit again

from the OTHER direction.

Drew is furious, and he can't even see the attacker.

No answer, as we HOLD on Drew looking around.

EXT. WORK AREA  DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DARK BROWN LIQUID BEING POURED INTO A LARGE PIT.

Drew is walking with Li, having just dumped their buckets into a

large hole.

They turn to go back, and there is Gao, balancing a huge basket of

night soil over his head, peasant-style. He is on the same ridge that

they are going to walk on.

He reaches down and plucks a stick out of the earth at his feet, and

then closes on Gao a little bit.

Drew pokes at the basket for a moment, right over Gao's head. Then,

he JAMS the stick in, and holds it there.

Drew pulls the stick out and watches as the night soil cascades down

onto Gao's head. They back away as Gao goes running towards the pit

where the night soil is deposited.

EXT. WORK AREA  DAY

THE DISCIPLES ARE WORKING EXTREMELY HARD.

As they work, a group of fighting monks walk by after a workout. Drew

stops working and watches them pass.

Suddenly, a bamboo pole CRACKS Drew on the shoulder. He turns around,

ready for a fight, only to see the D.S. standing there, the pole

raised for another strike.

Drew is about to say something, but doesn't. He returns to work.

DORM AREA  NIGHT

ANGLE ON DREW MASSAGING HIS MUSCLES

He is sitting with Li and a couple of the other disciples, Wu, Shu

and Low.

They all huddle a little closer.

EXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE  DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF D.S. AS HE WALKS ALONG THE PATH.

In the b.g. can be seen Drew, Li, Wu and a couple other of the

disciples. They are waiting for something.

The D.S. hits the trip wire and suddenly two bamboo poles HURTLE

towards him, ready to slam him in the shoulders.

With one beautiful move, the D.S. breaks both poles, shattering when

they hit his arms.

The D.S. hardly breaks stride and continues walking. He looks back

once, and sees the outline of the group of disciples.

ANGLE ON DREW AND THE GUYS

Who are up and running as soon as they are spotted. They run by Gao,

who was watching from another area.

EXT. D.S. QUARTERS  SAME DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF GAO WAITING OUTSIDE D.S. ROOM.

He looks around, knocks, and then goes in.

EXT. COURTYARD  SAME DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF ENTIRE CLASS GATHERED TOGETHER.

The D.S. walks into the front of the courtyard and addresses the

group.

Gao is standing off to the side, a smug smile on his face.

ANGLE ON GAO

The smug smile gone now.

INT. MEDITATION ROOM  DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF GROUP OF DISCIPLES SEATED ON ROUND PILLOWS

PRACTISING ZAZEN, SITTING MEDITATION.

Drew is in the center of the room, and the sound of light snoring is

heard.

ANGLE ON DREW

It is him, he is asleep!

Suddenly, a bamboo shinai is SLAMMED across Drew's back, waking him

up.

EXT. WORK AREA  DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF THE ENTIRE GROUP LABORING IN THE FIELDS.

They are all singing "Chain Gang".

TIGHT ON SEVERAL OF THE DISCIPLES

They are good workers, and they don't mind the hard work nor the hot

weather quite so much.

ANGLE ON DREW

Working hard.

INT. DORM AREA  NIGHT

ANGLE ON DREW

Who is holding court.

The others are with him too, except for Gao. They are ready to

explode, and Drew has the match.

They are all ready. They head for the door, but Gao doesn't move.

Drew stops at the door and turns to Gao.

No answer from Gao. They exit the room.

INT. HALLWAY  SAME NIGHT

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW AND THE BOYS RUSHING DOWN THE CORRIDOR,

HEADING FOR SAN DE'S QUARTERS.

ANGLE ON D.S.

Heading for the same place but from a different direction.

INT. SHAOLIN HALLWAY  SAME NIGHT

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF GROUP ASSEMBLED OUTSIDE SAN DE'S CHAMBERS.

Drew goes to knock on the door, when it opens and San De is standing

there. The D.S. has just arrived. He looks at San De for

instructions, but San De indicates that he will deal with them.

San De holds up his hand. He is the final authority.

ANGLE ON THE DISCIPLES

Who tonight have been anything but humble.

The disciples can hardly believe their luck.

ANGLE ON DREW

Who is sputtering now.

They all say "Thank you" as one, and then bow to the headmaster with

their hands clasped in front of them. They turn away and head down

the hallway.

ANGLE ON THE DISCIPLES

As they increase their pace, almost running through the halls with

their excitement.

INT. DORM AREA  SAME NIGHT

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DOOR TO THE SLEEPING QUARTERS.

Suddenly, it BURSTS open and in come the disciples, led by Drew. They

fan out into the room, Drew in the center.

He runs to his backpack and pulls out a boom box with speakers, and

puts on some good old American Rock 'N' Roll.

Everyone, but Gao, is moving in time with the music. Drew is the most

accomplished dancer, but the others are pretty bad.

The entire effect of the bald-headed monks rocking out is very comic.

Drew starts showing Li and Wu a couple of dance routines (old stuff

the swim, the twist, etc.). Everyone is having a great time.

ANGLE ON GAO

Glowering, as he moves toward the boom box.

He reaches for the "Stop" button.

Drew blocks the arm, and a pushing and shoving match starts.

They push and shove into the middle of the room, a couple of kicks

and punches thrown, then they face off, ready to duke it out.

The party is raging, while Gao and Drew are the only ones static, set

to do battle.

Just then, the door starts to open. Everyone freezes and looks toward

the door, including Gao. Drew, meanwhile, has the presence of mind to

jump onto the boom box, shutting it off and hiding it with his body.

ANGLE ON DOOR

As the D.S. opens it and sticks his head in.

He surveys the room, seeing the tableau of frozen monks, with Drew

lying on his bed.

ANGLE ON DREW

Who waves to the D.S.

ANGLE ON THE D.S.

Who knows that something is going on.

He hits the lights and then closes the door. In the semi-darkness the

room relaxes in a collective sigh. Drew stands up and packs up the

stereo.

Gao walks over past Drew.

INT. MAIN CHAMBER  MORNING

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF CHAMBER FULL OF FIGHTING MONKS, ALL GOING

THROUGH THE SAME SET OF MOVEMENTS.

Kick. Punch.

Kick. Punch.

INTERCUT of feet striking the stone floor, depressions in the floor

testifying to the centuries of training this chamber has seen.

Through the door come the D.S., Drew and the others. They line up

along one wall, watching the fighting monks go through their form.

It is beautiful: powerful, graceful and intimidating.

Their form done, they file out of the chamber, leaving the D.S. with

his group, along with one fighting monk. The D.S. motions for them to

line up as the monks had.

D.S. lets that sink in, then motions for the monk to take over.

He goes through a couple of martial movements.

ANGLE ON DREW

Confused.

ANGLE ON MONK

Who doesn't explain any further.

ANGLE ON FLOOR

Where there are depressions and worn spots, the result of thousands

of hours of training.

He starts moving through a series of techniques, and the rest of the

disciples try to mimic his actions. He is moving around the room, and

they are trying to do what he is doing.

Some are getting it, some aren't.

Drew, used to a more individualized type of training, isn't getting

it.

EXT. TRAINING AREA  DAY

ESTABLISHING TIGHT SHOT OF WEDGE THWOCKING INTO THE GROUND.

A hand COMES INTO FRAME, grabs the wedge and pulls it back out of the

ground.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL Drew, along with the other disciples, lined up

and throwing these sharp wedges into the ground and pulling it back

out. Their muscles are bulging with the effort.

ANGLE ON HUGE SMOKING BRASS URNS

Filled to the brim with small stones. Drew is forcing his arms into

the urn in "Iron Palm" training.

ANGLE ON MONK ON A SET OF POLES

He is going through a complex form, kicking and punching, never

missing or faltering a step. Some of the poles are as high as 6 feet

off the ground.

ANGLE ON GAO ON THE POLES

He is less sure, but at least he doesn't fall.

ANGLE ON DREW

Trying the poles. He starts out well, but he soon misses and falls,

almost impaling himself on a pole.

EXT. TRAINING AREA  DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DISCIPLES PAIRED OFF.

Drew is working with his friend Li. They are moving through a series

of techniques, ending with a flashy kicking technique which is to

blocked by a special Shaolin technique.

Each time Li throws the final kick, Drew gets hit, HARD.

His block isn't working. A monk comes up to him.

Drew bows and turns to continue working with Li. By this time,

however, the ranks have shifted, and Gao is opposite Drew.

Drew attacks first in the series, and Gao uses the block to easily

deflect Drew's kick.

He attacks, and Drew gets to the final technique. He blocks the way

he did before, and he gets slammed brutally by Gao.

Gao stands over him, smiling.

EXT. TRAINING AREA  DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF MONKS FLIPPING THROUGH THE AIR, DOING FLYING

KICKS, AERIALS, ETC.

A monk is alternately falling down and kipping up, falling down and

kipping up.

Drew's group is working on several very athletic maneuvers, none of

which Drew is especially good at. Gao, of course, is having no

trouble.

Drew tries a flying move and falls into a heap on the ground. He is

very angry, and he hits the ground with his fist.

Drew sits in the dirt, watching everyone around him sail through the

air and flip over the ground. He is not a happy camper.

EXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE  DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF TRAINING AREA.

The entire group is gathered in a sort of pit, on a hard concrete

floor. D.S. stands in the middle.

He scans the group, and then points to Drew. Drew smiles ruefully,

walks to the front and bows to D.S.

The group laughs a little at that, and Drew's manhood is now

challenged.

ANGLE ON GAO

Who is already getting up, ready and willing.

This changes Drew's mind right away.

ANGLE ON DREW AND D.S.

Drew attacks, and is taken down brutally, smashed into the hard

concrete floor. No attempt is made to cushion or soften the blow.

Drew gets up right away, and attacks again. Again he is driven to the

ground. This continues from all angles and all methods of attack.

ANGLE ON THE GROUP

Who can barely watch the destruction.

ANGLE ON THE FIGHT

The D.S. does not let up at all, taking

Drew down hard each time. Every time, regardless of the impact, Drew

gets right back up. His eyes are dazed, there is a little blood

coming out of his nose, but he keeps coming back for more.

Finally, after a high arcing back throw, a real thumper, the worst of

all of them, the D.S. calls it a day.

Before anyone can move, however, Drew raises his hand as high as he

can, obviously in pain.

The group gasps, knowing how much Drew must be hurting, admiring him

for his guts. Even Gao is impressed.

Drew attacks, and the D.S. executes the manuever perfectly, crashing

Drew down almost on his head. Luckily, Drew is able to twist at the

last moment and take the impact on his already bruised shoulder. He

moans and groans and lies there.

The group disburses, shaking their heads in wonder. Li comes up to

Drew, who is still lying on the ground.

He tries to get up, but moans in pain and falls back down.

Li helps him up and takes him to the showers.

ANGLE ON D.S.

Watching them go. There is a slight smile on his face.

EXT. DORMITORY  SAME DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF LI RUBBING THE BRUISE ON DREW'S SHOULDER WITH

TIGER BALM.

It is huge, and looks really painful.

Drew pulls away and stands up. He backs up to the wall of the

dormitory, right underneath a window.

Just as he is talking, Gao comes to the window with a pan of dirty

water (from washing the floor of the dorm).

GAO LOOKS DOWN (GAO POV) AND SEES DREW

Hhe smiles, then pours the huge bucket over the edge, dousing Drew.

ANGLE ON DREW

As the dirty water hits him, drenching him.

EXT. WATERFALL  DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF WATERFALL.

It is huge, and the water is crashing down from high above.

ANGLE ON A MONK, INSIDE THE WATERFALL

He is going through martial arts techniques as the water thunders

onto him.

ANGLE ON D.S. AND GROUP

As they stand on the bank.

Li smiles and walks into the waterfall, using a walkway that goes

behind the thundering water.

He moves into the water a little, and gets into a deep horse stance.

He stand there, immovable. After a moment, he turns to look at D.S.

ANGLE ON D.S.

Who motions him farther into the water.

ANGLE ON LI

Who nods his head and walks into the thundering water. As soon as he

gets into the main stream of water, he is forced off the ledge and he

falls about 20 feet into the pool below.

Each of them try it in turn. Everyone fails.

Gao goes in, and he manages to stand under the impact of the water

for a moment, before he too succumbs and goes down into the pool.

ANGLE ON DREW

It's his turn. He walks to the waterfall and goes in. He picks up an

umbrella he stashed behind the waterfall (imprinted with a "NEW YORK

GIANTS NFL" logo on it  unmistakably American).

He walks into the waterfall, and the umbrella works for a moment.

Drew is holding it with both hands, and he gets into a deep horse

stance.

He turns to smile at the D.S., and then waves at the others. As soon

as he takes a hand off the handle of the umbrella, the water slams

him and off he goes into the pool.

He lands with a huge splash, doing a painful bellow flop. Drew comes

to the surface, still clutching the now- destroyed umbrella. He

smiles at the other disciples, who are still swimming, sheepishly.

INT. TEMPLE TRAINING HALL  DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF GROUPS WORKING OUT.

Drew is in with the group. Gao and Drew are chosen to do a training

exercise together.

The group gets started doing the drill, and Gao is almost caving

Drew's chest in with his blows. He is so close to Drew that Drew

doesn't have a chance to block it. On the last strike, Drew falls

back to the ground.

The D.S. is there immediately.

Drew shakes his head and gets back up.

Now it's Drew's turn to strike, and he tries to hit Gao with the same

amount of force as he did, but Gao avoids his attack, throwing him

off balance. He throws another punch out, and Gao grabs it and pulls.

Drew falls to the floor again. A monk who was watching walks over.

The Monk walks away, shaking his head.

EXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE  EVENING

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF TEMPLE COURTYARD, EMPTY EXCEPT FOR DREW AND LI

PLAYING CATCH WITH A FRISBEE.

Drew is flipping it in a bunch of different ways, and Li is enjoying

watching him.

To the side of the courtyard are two brooms leaning against the wall.

ANGLE ON FRISBEE

Floating past temple statues and ancient Chinese decorations, barely

missing them.

Drew makes an acrobatic catch and then flicks it back to Li, harder

than he should have. It heads for an ancient statue and smacks it

dead center, right in the face.

The statue starts to tip!

Drew and Li rush for the statue and catch it, just before it tips

over and smashes on the ground.

They look at each other, thanking their lucky stars the statue didn't

fall. They start to throw the frisbee again, when Drew spots the D.S.

coming towards them.

Drew stashes the frisbee in his shirt and grabs the brooms.

He tosses one to Li and they just begin sweeping again when the D.S.

rounds the corner.

The D.S. knows something is going on, but they look so innocent.

He bows and smiles goodbye to Li. He walks into the main training

chamber.

INT. CHAMBER  SAME EVENING

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW WALKING INTO THE CHAMBER.

This is the chamber where they had their first workout, and Drew just

stands there for a moment, soaking up the tradition of it.

He walks to an area of the chamber under the famous painting and

stands staring at it.

QUICK CUTS to different ANGLES of the painting.

ANGLE ON DREW

Who begins to sweep.

His broom is going over the depressions where the monks train, and

soon he loses his desire to sweep. He takes the broom in his hand as

a weapon and starts to spin it, going through a martial arts form,

his feet moving naturally into the depressions in the floor.

He finishes with a flourish, having moved into a shadowy area in a

corner, and then bows to an imaginary crowd, using the broom as a

microphone.

Drew holds his broom over his head, nodding his head to the imaginary

crowd.

Just then, out of the shadows comes an attacking staff, SLAMMING into

Drew's unprotected stomach!

Drew, ready to double over in pain, hears the staff hit the frisbee,

and stands up straight, adjusting the frisbee that saved his stomach.

Before he can react, the staff SMACKS him in the back of the head and

sends him pitching to the floor.

ANGLE ON DREW

As he lands face down in the pile of dust and dirt he already swept

up.

EXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE  EVENING

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF TEMPLE COURTYARD, THE SUN SETTING IN THE

DISTANCE.

Drew is standing in front of a painting-statue of Bodhidharma, one in

which he is made to look extremely fierce.

San De walks up behind Drew and stands there for a moment.

San De walks away, and Drew follows him.

INT. SAN DE'S CHAMBERS  SAME NIGHT

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF SAN DE BREWING TEA.

The room is filled with paintings and scrolls. A Golden Sash hangs in

a place of honor.

San De    puts the tea    leaves into the pot, then soaks them with boiling

water.    He pours the    water out, then repeats the process several

times.    His movements    are all very precise and careful  it almost

looks    like a martial    art kata.

San De looks pointedly at Drew, who doesn't meet his eyes.

and impulsively he gives her a hug, genuinely very happy to see her.

Li arrives and pulls them apart.

He turns to Ashema, who has now backed off a little bit and is

looking at Drew, a smile on her face, but is pretending that she is

embarrassed. The other girls are gathered around, giggling.

Li tugs at Drew's shirt.

One of the giggle girls behind Ashema whispers something in her ear.

relatively controlled. After one particularly powerful shot, Drew

stops.

Drew stares at Gao, then looks around for the D.S. He is over at the

other side of the training area.

Before he can move, however, Gao attacks, slamming him full power in

the face. Drew almost falls to the ground, then attacks him and the

battle is joined.

Drew pauses, and Gao is even more surprised at the revelation.

ANGLE ON SAN DE

Who nods his head and looks at Drew.

Gao looks at Drew, wondering what he should say. Drew looks at him,

nodding for him to say yes.

Gao looks at Drew, knowing that the anger is already long gone, swept

away in the shock of Drew taking the blame.

They shake hands.

Both Drew and Gao notice the Golden Sash hanging on the wall. It is

occupying a place of honor.

San De nods.

Drew and Gao get up, bow to San De and head for the door.

They get to the door at the same time, however, and for a moment they

jockey for position, trying to be the first one through the door.

Drew shoots Li and Gao a questioning look. Drunk? In the temple?

They take refuge behind a couple of the columns and watch as the monk

observing everything that's going on.

Ashema smiles a sheepish smile. Drew decides that if they are going

to have a good time, he's going to have a hand in it. He pulls out a

cassette tape, gives it to Ashema

She nods and walks off. Drew motions for Gao and the guys to come

over. They do, and when they do, Drew turns to the giggle girls

He drags Gao over to one of the prettier girls.

Drew does the same for Li, Wu, Su, Sou and all the others, forcing

He turns back to Ashema, but she is pulled back by the giggle girls,

away from danger.

has already gotten behind him, on his knees, and Drew goes flipping

over the tough, landing hard on the ground, the wind knocked out of

him.

Drew gets up, wincing, not really ready to fight.

The tough pulls his fist back to strike Drew, who has been grabbed by

two other toughs, his arms pinned behind his back.

Suddenly, a figure FLIES in and SLAMS the tough to the ground.

It is Gao, and he immediately sets on the other toughs. The room

ERUPTS in a melee as the disciples go at it with the village toughs.

Also in the room are two high-ranking police officials. The

Headmistress is yelling at the top of her lungs, and San De is just

sitting there, letting her vent. She has obviously been going at it

for some time, because her face is sweaty and flushed. She stops when

Drew and the D.S. enter and points an accusing finger at Drew.

Drew can only nod.

Drew's head snaps up at the words "morals charge"

They all agree that Drew should leave, and for a moment the sound of

the three of them agreeing fills the room (ad libs).

San De pauses, letting this sink in. The D.S. steps forward.

The police don't have an easy answer to that.

This sinks in, and the police have nothing to say. The Headmistress

will not keep quiet, however.

Drew catches a hard look from the D.S.

She is about to speak, but thinks better of it.

San De stands up, signalling that the meeting is over.

The Headmistress starts to say something, but San De holds up his

hand, stopping her. He leads them out, then closes the door and comes

for a moment. She then turns to him, and starts to say something.

Drew stops her with a finger on her lips, then strokes her cheek.

Ashema closes her eyes against the tears there, and buries her head

against Drew's shoulder.

She wants to hear that they are, even if it's not true. She NEEDS to

hear it.

Drew pulls her head away from his shoulder, looking into her eyes. It

would be so easy not to take the blame for hurting her like this.

D.S. smiles and motions for an old monk standing near him to take his

place. the old man puts his arm up on Gao's shoulder, and takes a

deep breath. He does not tense up his arm and shoulder.

Gao looks questioning at the D.S.

Gao starts to pull down, gently at first, but when he sees that the

old monk's arm is not bending, stronger, until finally he is putting

all his strength into it. The old monk's arm has not moved, and his

expression of relaxation and piece has not changed.

Gao quits, not able to bend the arm. D.S. motions for Drew to get on

the other side of the monk.

A gong sounds, O.S., and Gao and Drew stop, bow to each other, and

then embrace, smiling.

Drew moves off to the side to get a drink of water, and to towel off.

As he rubs his neck, D.S. comes up to him.

Drew raises his eyebrows, then looks over at Gao and Li. He rolls up

his towel and snaps Gao with it as he walks by.

EXT. SMALL TOWN  SAME DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW STOPPING IN A SMALL TOWN, IN THE MIDDLE OF

AN OPEN AIR MARKET.

He goes over to a drink stand, and buys a cool drink. Just as he is

about to drink it down, it is KNOCKED from his hand.

Drew turns around and see four dirty thugs and their leader  the one

who hit the glass. They are yelling at Drew in Chinese, which he

doesn't understand.

Drew, not looking for trouble, bends down to pick up the glass, and

the leader kicks him in the rear end, sending him pitching to the

ground. Drew rolls to a standing position, and the five men close on

him.

A crowd is now starting to form, eager to watch how the monk handles

this situation.

The thugs come after Drew, and the leader throws a roundhouse punch,

hitting Drew square in the jaw. They continue to attack, while Drew

tries to avoid getting hit. Drew catches a haymaker, and he spins and

drops, and the thugs laugh, kick him a couple of times, and then kick

dust and dirt onto him. Drew doesn't get up.

They soon tire of the sport and move on, the crowd staring at Drew in

pity.

ANGLE ON THE THUGS

Who have now spotted a man and his young son. They are both loaded

down with goods from the store, and the thugs stop them. They take

the things from them, and start to walk off.

The father tries to fight back, but they easily beat him up, sending

him into the dirt. The young boy runs forward. The leader of the

thugs raises his hand, ready to slap the boy's face.

Before he can bring his arm forward, Drew's fingers come around his

wrist, stopping it.

ANGLE ON THE CROWD

It's getting good now.

The fight    starts, and this    time Drew is unencumbered by    vows of non-

violence.    He has a cause,    and he's enjoying every minute    of the

fight. It    is over quickly,    as Drew is a superb fighter,    using

incredible    techniques. The    thugs limp away, leaving Drew    with the

little boy    and his father.

Drew bends down and picks up the goods, handing them back to the boy

and the father. Drew stops and kneels down in front of the boy,

looking deep into his eyes.

A whisper is going through the crowd: "Shaolin".

Drew touches the boy's cheek, smiles, then stands up and bows. He

moves on, the crowd watching him walk away.

surroundings.

EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE  NEXT DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW WORKING OUT NEXT TO A MOUNTAIN LAKE.

He is throwing kicks and going through his routines, concentrating on

his breathing. As he finishes a particularly strenuous series, he

strips off his clothes and dives into the lake.

As Drew's head breaks the surface of the lake, he is surprised to see

a beautiful woman standing next to where he left his clothes.

Drew starts to get out of the lake, then remembers that he is naked

he stops, not quite knowing what to do. He goes as close to the shore

as he can without coming out of the water.

The woman just smiles, and starts to strip off what clothing she has

on. She is very sexy.

Pouting, the woman takes Drew's pants and tosses them to him, but

they land (purposely) about 5 feet away from the lake edge.

ANGLE ON DREW

Who realizes he is going to have to get out of the water without a

cover. He gets up and hurries to where his pants are. He starts to

put them on, and the woman is all over him, trying to seduce him.

He takes her hands in his and forces her to look him in the eye.

He lowers her hands, and her head drops, pouting.

He kisses her on the forehead, and then grabs the rest of his

clothes, running up the path away from the lake.

EXT. TEMPLE  SAME DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF VERY ORNATE TEMPLE.

Drew walks up to the front of the temple, looks around for a moment,

then takes a drink of water from the well out front.

Just as he starts to drink, a huge TOUR BUS pulls up in front, air

brakes HISSING. Before he can react, the doors open and a bunch of

AMERICAN TOURISTS pile out of the bus and rush into the temple,

jostling Drew from side to side.

The wave of tourists passes Drew, and he stands there looking after

them. Then, as a group, they realize that they just passes a monk,

and turn back to Drew.

The tourist runs up to where Drew is and stands next to him. The

cameras click and whirr, and Drew is thoroughly embarrassed. When the

first pictures are over, and someone else wants to stand next to him,

he raises his hands up to his face and bows.

He then turns and walks away.

EXT. WATERFALL  EARLY MORNING

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF THUNDERING WATERFALL.

Drew stands at the side of the waterfall, studying his map. From his

expression, we know that he has to go through the waterfall to get

where he is going.

Drew pockets the map, checks that the box is safely in place, then

starts toward the waterfall. The drop off the side of the waterfall

is incedible  steep and deadly.

ANGLE ON DREW

As he enters the waterfall. The water hits his back, almost pitching

him into the abyss. Drew concentrates and moves forward, slowly but

surely.

He emerges on the other side, only to be confronted by a swamp.

Jutting out of the swamp are rocks and tree stumps.

Drew examines the distance between the objects, realizing that he can

jump from place to place and make it across.

He starts out, jumping onto the first stone, then moving on to the

others. He almost falls a couple of times, but regains his balance.

He gets a rythm going, and is soon almost halfway across.

He gets to one particular rock, only to find out that it's the head

of an alligator! Its mouth opens to bite him!

Drew jumps off it quickly, onto a tree stump. When he lands on the

stump, he examines it carefully to make sure it isn't something else.

He continues across, more careful this time.

EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE  SAME DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW CLIMBING UP THE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN.

It is much steeper now, and the going is much tougher.

ANGLE ON DREW

As he comes up onto a rope bridge over a deep gorge, the way to the

arhat. Drew smiles, stashes the map and starts across the rope

bridge, hand over hand. He looks down once, at the DROP, then forces

himself to look straight ahead.

He just starts across when the rope bends and jumps. Drew turns

around to see a man RIGHT BEHIND HIM.

No answer from the man, who is now pushing Drew to go faster. He is

inching up closer to him, and occassionally kicking him to go

quicker.

ANGLE ON THE ROPE BEHIND THEM

Which is starting to fray from the weight.

ANGLE ON DREW

Who sees that and is hurrying.

The rope is fraying more, and when Drew is almost there, the rope

snaps and they both go swinging into the side of the mountain.

ANGLE ON DREW

Who slams into the wall hard. when he hits, the scroll POPS out of

his pocket and goes up in the air.

Drew, groggy from the impact, manages to lash out and PIN the scroll

to the cliff wall with the BACK of his hand.

ANGLE ON MAN

Who is barely hanging on, just below Drew.

He has his hand out to Drew for help.

ANGLE ON DREW

Who doesn't know what to do. If he tries to save the scroll, the man

might fall. If he goes for the man, the box will certainly fall.

ANGLE ON THE MAN

Screaming for help.

Drew hears the headmaster's voice.

He looks down at the man, who is about to lose it.

Drew reaches down for the man's hand, letting the box fall.

Their hands meet, and Drew pulls him up.

EXT. ARHAT HUT  SAME EVENING

DREW COMES OUT OF THE HUT AND WALKS AROUND TO THE AREA BEHIND THE

HUT, HIGH UP ON THE MOUNTAIN.

The view is incredible. Drew stands looking at the view, and slowly

becomes aware of a figure sitting on the ground near him.

He looks down, and it is the ARHAT!

The Arhat says nothing, but just puts out his hand for the scroll.

Drew bows again, and gets down on his knees.

The Arhat holds up his hand, and Drew stops talking.

Drew bows once more and is ready to leave. The Arhat reaches into his

robes and pulls out the embroidered box that Drew was given at the

temple.

The Arhat holds up the box in front of Drew for a moment, then tears

it in two with his hands, scattering the pieces to the winds.

The Arhat sits without moving or speaking. Drew takes that as a yes.

The Arhat ponders that for a moment, then smiles and puts his sandles

on his head and stands up.

He walks off, leaving Drew sitting there, dumbstruck by the answer.

He shakes his head and gets up, following the Arhat. The Arhat is

standing on the other side of his hut, the sandles still on his head.

Drew and the monk bow to each other, the sunset over the mountain in

the b.g.

EXT. ARHAT HUT  NEXT MORNING

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW COMING OUT OF THE HUT, HAVING JUST GOTTEN

brought him to the hut. The Arhat runs after him, grabs his sleeve

and pulls him over to a place behind his hut.

DREW'S POV OF A ROAD BEHIND THE ARHAT'S HUT

A road! After all he went through to get there?

stop.

grabs the staff and PULLS.

Out comes the D.S. into the night on the other end of the staff. He

looks proudly at Drew.

ANGLE ON D.S.

As he smiles and bows in respect to Drew.

Drew returns his bow.

EXT. SHAOLIN TEMPLE  DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF SAN DE WRITING BOLD, BLACK CALLIGRAPHY ON A BARE

WHITE PAPER.

The CAMERA follows the sweeping brush, as it ends with a FLOURISH.

The CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL the temple courtyard, where San De

and the D.S. are standing in front of the group of disciples.

They are remembering the stories they have heard about the chamber.

San De pauses, letting this remark sink in.

ANGLE ON DREW

Who rises to the challenge.

San De nods.

ANGLE ON DREW

In front of the entrance to the Wooden Man Chamber. San De and D.S.

are flanking Drew as he pauses in front of the door. Drew turns to

look at San De, and the D.S. smacks Drew in the back of the head.

Drew smiles at the D.S.'s attempt to lighten him up. He turns to look

at the others from his disciple class, then opens the door and goes

through.

INT. WOODEN MAN CHAMBER  SAME DAY

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF WOODEN MAN CHAMBER.

Drew pauses for a moment,      examining the room. It is filled with

wooden statues of monks,      all in different fighting positions. The

carvings are precise and      incredibly beautiful. Their arms, open

hands, fists and legs are      fashioned out of hard wood, and they look

very dangerous indeed.

Drew gathers himself for a moment, then starts into the chamber.

ANGLE ON DREW'S FOOT

As it presses down on one of the stones of the floor.

The attacks start  from all sides, as the wooden statues COME TO

LIFE, spinning, lunging and striking.

Drew is caught off guard, and is hit several times, driven back to

the door of the chamber. The statues stop moving.

Drew, a little scared, tries to remember the sequence of the statues,

letting his arms practice for the attacks.

There is fear in his eyes.

He starts in again, and the attacks come again, but they are

different this time.

Drew is clobbered.

Driven back to the door, Drew slumps against the wall. His face is

already bruised and bleeding.

FLASHBACK TO D.S.

FLASHBACK TO SEVERAL D.S. ATTACKS

Including the one where Drew succeeded in evading them.

ANGLE ON DREW

Who gathers himself, straightens up and takes a deep breath, forcing

it out in a breathing exercise.

He enters the chamber again, and the attacks start again.

Drew, however, is prepared (both mentally and physically).

He blocks, avoids, rolls, jumps and redirects the attacks on him,

making his way across.

He is about halfway across when an especially fierce and large statue

comes crashing towards him. Drew, caught a little off guard, quickly

adjusts and manages to jump and spin out of the way.

Suddenly, as he turns and tries to get his breath, two huge, deadly

spears are streaking towards him. Drew blocks the SPEARS with his

arms, misdirecting them into the wall behind him.

They THWOCK into the wall, sticking there.

As he rounds a particularly difficult series of statues, a volley of

ARROWS comes HURTLING towards him. Drew blocks some, avoids others,

and catches one in each hand. He throws them down and continues on.

He goes past the few remaining statues, and is out of the Wooden Man

Chamber. All that is left is to walk down a little hallway and out

the door.

Drew looks behind him, then starts to walk. He goes cautiously,

expecting a trap or a trick.

Nothing happens.

He gets to the door and looks for a handle on the door. He spots a

handhold near the top of the door, and pulls it with his hand.

Immediately, his hands is locked in and a panel in the ceiling DROPS

right onto his arm, forcing it down. Drew fights back with his

muscles, the veins popping out in his arms and neck.

Behind him, a statue has started coming towards him, spinning like a

dervish. Its fists and legs are extended, and they are deadly.

The panel drops lower and lower.

FLASHBACK TO UNBENDABLE ARM SEQUENCE

ANGLE ON DREW

As he relaxes his face, and forcibly relaxes his arm and entire body,

letting his inner energy take over.

ANGLE ON PANEL

As it slows with a GRINDING NOISE, then stops.

ANGLE ON DREW

Holding up the heavy stone panel with his arm, his face and body

completely relaxed.

The panel goes back up into the ceiling, and the door opens.

The whirling statue slows, and then stops altogether. Drew reaches up

with a hook kick and taps it in the face.

Drew quickly walks through the door.

temple is gathered to watch the ceremony.

San De and D.S. are dressed in elaborate ceremonial robes.

After he goes through some complicated ceremonial movements,

including the waving of smoking incense over them, San De spreads his

hands

A roar rises from the assembled monks, and fireworks go off all

around.

up to him and they bow.

ANGLE ON DREW

Who digests this. He smiles a little.

From out of the bamboo grove comes Ashema, her hands in front of her

and her head down. She is not sure Drew wants to see her.

Drew looks at her, then back to San De, but he is already gone. They

are alone.

Drew walks to her, takes her chin in his hand and tilts it up to look

at her face. Her eyes are full of love and tenderness, and a little

fear.

Drew kisses that fear away.

people, comes clear... it is Trevor!

ANGLE ON DREW

Who is stunned.

ANGLE ON SAN DE

Could he have known?

ANGLE ON TREVOR

Who spots drew standing near the ring. He walks past him, trying to

place his face. Then, he comes back and walks right up to Drew and

slaps him on the back.

Drew is dumbstruck, and Trevor takes advantage of it.

He puts his arm around Ashema and lets his hand slide down onto her

rear end.

He walks off, and Drew, who still hasn't said a word, stares after

him. All of the monks are looking at Drew with questioning looks,

everyone that is except for San De.

ANGLE ON THE RING

As Trevor and the Shaolin entry bow to each other. The fight begins.

It isn't even close. Trevor is better than he ever was. He is

incredible, and he destroys the Shaolin fighter.

Oblivious to the boos and whistles from the crowd, he plays with the

Shaolin fighter, making him look like a real fool.

INTERCUT REACTION SHOTS OF DREW

Who is watching the destruction. Behind his eyes, he is reliving his

humiliation.

ANGLE ON TREVOR

Who finishes the shaolin fighter off with a devestating technique,

and then immediately plays to the crowd, RIGHT IN FRONT OF DREW AND

THE OTHERS.

The referee comes over to Trevor, and raises his fist up in victory.

Trevor tears his arm away and SCREAMS TO THE CROWD:

The crowd, which before was wild and booing, now grows quiet.

He points right at Drew.

The crowd, who has seen Drew and heard about him for quite a while,

warms to the prospect. They start cheering for the American Shaolin

to face Trevor.

ANGLE ON DREW

Who doesn't know what to do. San De appears and puts a comforting

hand on his shoulder.

ANGLE ON TREVOR

Pointing and yelling for Drew.

ANGLE ON DREW

Who climbs the ropes and goes into the ring. The crowd is going

crazy, eager to see the match. Drew, oblivious to the crowd, walks

over to Trevor.

He bows to Trevor and starts out of the ring.

ANGLE ON CROWD

They don't know what's going on.

ANGLE ON LI, GAO AND OTHERS

They don't know either. They want Drew to fight him.

ANGLE ON SAN DE AND D.S.

Who know what is happening and are proud of Drew, prouder than they

have ever been.

Drew steps out of the ring and walks over to where San De is

standing. They bow, and the pride is shining in San De's eyes.

ANGLE ON TREVOR

Who is seething.

ANGLE ON DREW

His face calm.

ANGLE ON TREVOR

ANGLE ON SAN DE

Who indicates trevor with a inclination of his head.

ANGLE ON TREVOR

He is pointing at Li and Gao and the others, who are itching to climb

into the ring. Gao goes over to San De, and shoots a questioning look

at Drew.

San De looks at Drew long and hard.

ANGLE ON DREW

Who understands the implication of what he is saying. He starts to

smile slowly.

Drew nods, then turns to face the ring, where Trevor is still

standing, trying to get someone to fight him.

Drew walks with Gao back to the side of the ring. He turns to Gao and

Li and together they high-five.

Drew climbs into the ring.

The crowd is going crazy. Trevor has a predator's grin on his face as

he sits down in his corner to get ready to start the match.

Immediately, his contingent of people start to work on him  massage,

drinks, etc.

ANGLE ON DREW

Who sits alone in the other corner.

ANGLE ON LI AND GAO

Who see the difference. Immediately, they mobilize the other monks.

ANGLE ON GAO

Who pulls a drink from one of the men in the crowd, and rushes up to

give it to Drew.

ANGLE ON DREW'S CORNER

As it is flooded with monks. Some of them are massaging Drew

(painfully), others are stretching his legs out, others waving towels

to bring air to him, etc.

The referee signals for the fighters to come to the center. They do,

and he motions for them to bow to each other.

They back up, and the fight begins.

Trevor attacks hard, but Drew avoids easily, using all soft gong fu.

He continues to attack, throwing flashy technique after flashy

technique, but he can't touch Drew.

And he dances out of the way. Trevor is getting more and more angry.

Soon, Drew tires of this game and decides to end this    quickly. He

goes after Trevor, and it is immediately obvious that    Trevor is

completely outclassed. Drew scores on Trevor at will,    and soon has

Trevor totally confused and helpless with a mixture of    high kicks,

takedowns, flips and punches.

Trevor drops to one knee, his hands down at his side, note even

bothering to defend himself.

Drew grabs Trevor by the front of his uniform and pulls back his

right hand in a fist. He is going to put him out with a good old-

fashioned roundhouse punch.

ANGLE ON LI AND GAO

Yelling for the knock out blow.

ANGLE ON D.S. AND SAN DE

Worried about this latest development.

Instead, however, Drew smiles and lifts Trevor up and shakes his

hand, putting an arm around him to steady him in front of the crowd.

Trevor looks into Drew's face, wondering why Drew would do such a

thing. When he sees Drew's friendly face, he knows.

To teach him a lesson.

Trevor smiles and holds up Drew's hand as the champion.

The crowd goes crazy.

ANGLE ON LI AND GAO

Who also get the message.

ANGLE ON SAN DE AND D.S.

Who knew the message all along.

Drew and Trevor standing together in the center. The monks on the

side climb into the ring to celebrate with Drew.

EXT. GREAT WALL  MORNING

ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DREW STANDING ON THE GREAT WALL, THE SUNSET OVER

HIS SHOULDER.

He is doing the beginning of a Shaolin form. When he finishes the

salute, a figure comes toward him.

It is San De, and he has something in his hands.

Drew bows to San De, and San De holds THE GOLDEN SASH out to him.

Drew takes it and San De bows to him. Drew can't stand it anymore,

and rushes up to San De. He gives him a hug.

ANGLE ON SAN DE

Who is not used to shows of affection. He is lost for a moment, then

his face softens and he returns Drew's embrace.

They break and bow again, and San De moves off. Drew stands there

holding the Golden Sash, the rising sun of the first day of the rest

of his life shining in the b.g.

ANGLE ON ASHEMA

Who comes up to Drew, taking his arm and walks with him along the

Great Wall.
