FADE IN:

EXT. THE PORT OF GENOA, ITALY - NIGHT

Forklifts RUMBLE. Workers WIPE FRAME. All the bustle and

cacophony of a major seaport.

We FIND ourselves focusing on ONE LARGE CRATE. With the

GRINDING of gears, a crane lifts it off the dock and carries

it onto a ship.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME

Through night-vision binoculars, CHARLIE CROKER, 28, watches

the mysterious crate. Charlie is young to run his own crew

but he's a born leader.

SWISH PAN TO: LYLE, 21, brilliant and punctilious, fingering

the keyboard of his strap-on supercharged laptop.

SWISH PAN TO: STEVE, 30, bearded. Steve has an arrogant

confidence mixed with the hint of a smile.

INT. HUMVEE (MOVING) - SAME TIME

The driver is HANDSOME ROB, 30. Riding shotgun is HALF-EAR,

35, immersed in a book: Albert Einstein Creator & Rebel.

Half-Ear is a large black man with a Southern accent and a

hearing aid.

Handsome Rob holds up three fingers.

INT. HOTEL JEWELRY SHOP - SAME TIME

The final member of the crew, JOHN BRIDGER, 50s, is a tasteful

man buying a very tasteful, and very expensive, diamond

necklace. The saleswoman wraps it up as he dials a number on

his cell phone.

INT. STELLA'S CONDO - PHILADELPHIA - INTERCUT

STELLA BRIDGER, 27, crushingly attractive, has just stepped

out of the shower, hair still wet, body wrapped in a towel.

He leaves the store and heads for the HOTEL ELEVATOR.

She doesn't like the sound of that.

He steps into the elevator. Rides up.

The elevator door opens, Bridger steps out and starts down

the hall.

He clicks off then uses his card key to step into the --

INT. HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

He eyes Charlie, who looks pretty tense.

INT. HOTEL BATHROOM - NIGHT

They step inside, Charlie closing the door.

Bridger seems amused by that answer.

Bridger pulls out a fine cigar, still in its wrapper, hands

it to Charlie.

From the other side of the door, they HEAR --

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Charlie takes the binoculars from Steve. He SEES TWO ITALIAN

CUSTOMS INSPECTORS climbing onboard the ship.

EXT. SHIP - NIGHT

In ITALIAN, the Inspectors quiz the NERVOUS CAPTAIN about

the mysterious crate.

One Inspector takes a crowbar and yanks out several strips

of plywood, REVEALING unmarked cardboard boxes inside. The

other Inspector pulls out one of the boxes and tears it open.

It is filled with tomatoes. He takes a bite out of one.

Nods. Everything seems to be order. The Captain looks

relieved. The inspector closes the cardboard box but...

Watch carefully now, because as he does this, he hits a power

button on a small HOMING DEVICE and stuffs it in with the

tomatoes...

INT. HOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME

On Lyle's computer screen, a pulsating dot appears, BEEPING,

sending out precise longitude and latitude.

Charlie dials his cell phone.

INT. HUMVEE (MOVING) - INTERCUT

Handsome Rob answers.

Handsome Rob pulls over. They're at the port. They can see

the mysterious crate being lowered into the ship's hold.

Half-Ear climbs out, taking a large duffel bag with him.

EXT. SHIP (DOCKED) - LATER, NIGHT

The Captain is doing his final checks before launch. OUR

CAMERA DROPS to --

BENEATH THE WATER

where we FIND Half-Ear, in scuba gear, applying Nitramon

explosive primer to the hull of the ship.

INT. HUMVEE (MOVING) - NIGHT

Plowing through thick brush that breaks out onto a secluded

beach. Handsome Rob is still behind the wheel but now Steve

is in the passenger seat. Lyle, in the back, is still on the

laptop, legs fidgeting like a drummer on meth. POP goes his

bubble gum.

EXT. UNDERNEATH THE SHIP - NIGHT

Half-Ear finishes up. Speaks into the headset inside his

gear.

Half-Ear grabs onto the bottom rung of a ladder that is bolted

to the side of the ship as it launches off the dock and into

deeper water.

TWO BRIGHT CIRCLES IN A SEA OF DARKNESS

Coming closer... becoming clearer... It's Charlie and John

Bridger, in scuba gear, riding torpedo-shaped Dive Propulsion

Vehicles (DPVs) that pull them through the deep blue sea at

a good 5 m.p.h. Both DPVs drag equipment bags.

A Global Satellite Positioning Device is mounted on the

handlebar of Charlie's DPV, being fed information via Lyle's

laptop. A circle pulsates on the monitor, a beacon to the

crate in the ship.

EXT. UNDER THE BOAT - NIGHT

Half-Ear still clings to the ladder. It's a wild ride.

Through the headset inside his gear, he HEARS:

Half-Ear lets go of the ladder. The ship's propellers speed

by just above his head. WHOOSH.

He removes a radio-controlled detonator. Hits the button.

EXT. SHIP - ON THE CUT

The hull of the boat EXPLODES.

INT. SHIP'S HOLD

A very neat hole on the bottom of the boat beneath the crate

is opened. Water RUSHES IN and the crate falls right through

the cavity, vanishing.

UNDERWATER

The huge, heavy crate drops down... down... hits the bottom.

ON THE SHIP

Chaos rules. She's taking on water fast. No way to save her.

The captain orders the dinghy lowered into the water.

INT. HUMVEE - NIGHT

Parked in the sand at the top of the bay. Steve looks out to

the bay through infrared binoculars.

The ship is going down. The crew on the dingy head back to

the port, which is in the opposite direction of this beach.

EXT. THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA - NIGHT

The DPVs are now attached by a tether to an underwater lifting

bag that is used to move heavy loads through water.

The crate is surrounded by our three diver-bandits.

Using crowbars they pull apart the plywood. The cardboard

boxes of tomatoes dump out, tomatoes spilling everywhere.

And now we see what was hidden between the boxes...

A large safe.

They move like clock-work. Half-Ear aims an underwater light

at the dial. Charlie drills a small hole near the dial.

John peers inside a horoscope and lines up the three wheels

of the combination lock... until the door pops open.

As they stare at what's inside, they speak into their

headsets, heard by all.

And now we see the contents of the safe: 160 glistening GOLD

BRICKS. Made in Singapore, they weigh 25 pounds and each one

is decorated with the face of an exotic Balinese girl. We're

talking thirty million dollars worth of gold.

INT. HUMVEE (PARKED) - NIGHT

They holler and high-five and it's just a great moment to be

alive. Steve takes another peek through his infrared

binoculars and sees --

The last vestiges of the ship hang above the waterline, then

disappear.

EXT. UNDERWATER - A LITTLE LATER

The gold is now stacked and secured on the lifting bag.

They attach an underwater parachute to the bag and hook a

hose from an air tank into press of a pressure release valves

which cause the parachute to INFLATE.

Looking like a hot-air balloon underwater, the whole thing

floats up about fifteen feet. Half-Ear holds onto its side,

going along for the ride.

Then Charlie and John Bridger speed off on the DPVs which

are tethered to the inflatable bag. As they glide through

the water towards the secluded beach, we...

EXT. MOUNTAINOUS ROAD - FIRST LIGHT OF DAWN

The Humvee climbs into the mountain ranges of the Alps.

INT. HUMVEE (MOVING)

The gold is in three crates in the cargo bay.

Handsome Rob and Steve are still up front. The others are in

the back seats, the divers out of their scuba gear. They are

pouring champagne into paper cups; except for Bridger who

abstains. He holds up his empty cup.

They laugh and pound their fists against the roof of the

Humvee. Charlie pulls out the cigar Bridger gave him. As

Bridger lights it for him --

Hearing this, Steve looks a little jealous.

Bridger shows him a photograph of Stella that he keeps in

his wallet.

As the advice escapes Bridger's mouth --

EXT. MOUNTAINOUS ROAD

A Jeep thunders out of a hiding place in the trees and blocks

the road. The Humvee brakes to avoid running into it.

Click. That's the sound of a gun cocking as it's pressed

against Handsome Rob's temple.

They see the two Italian Inspectors jump out of the Jeep, AK-

47s leveled at the crew. Steve has double-crossed them.

ON THE CREW: shocked would be a good place to start.

The Italians pull the crates of gold out of the back of the

Humvee.

Steve climbs out of the Humvee, gun still on Handsome Rob,

the AK-47s aimed at the others.

EXT. HUMVEE

Safely outside, Steve turns his gun on Bridger.

BOOM. He shoots Bridger in the head. Just like that.

The Italians follow suit, AK-47s SCREAMING out bursts of

full automatic fire at the crew.

INT. HUMVEE

They duck for cover as the vehicle is riddled with gunfire.

Glass shatters. Bullets ricochet. They're in the epicenter

of hell.

Handsome Rob jerks the steering wheel and stomps the gas.

Driving blind.

EXT. MOUNTAINOUS ROAD

The Humvee hits the side of the Jeep, grinds alongside it,

metal tearing against metal.

The Humvee's right side tires precariously hover by the cliff

and the raging water below.

The gunners keep FIRING. Bullets rip into the Humvee's tires.

EXT. HUMVEE

It almost escapes, but it can't make it on shredded rubber.

It careens off the road and --

SERIES OF SHOTS

The Humvee plummets through the air and plunges into the

raging river.

INT. HUMVEE

Water cascades in through the open windows. They're thrown

around as the Humvee rides the rapids. WHAM. The passenger

door caves in as the Humvee rams into a large rock then is

swept further downstream. Through the foam and spray, Charlie

looks over to Bridger. He's dead. The torrent ROARS.

Only their chests and heads are above water. And that's not

all. There's a WATERFALL AHEAD.

EXT. WATERFALL

The Humvee is palmed in its deadly embrace and hurled over.

It cartwheels into the pool below, sending up a huge geyser

of water.

It sinks out of sight.

EXT. MOUNTAINOUS ROAD - SAME TIME

The crates of gold are now inside the Italians' Jeep. Steve

climbs in, leaving the crew for dead.

UNDERWATER - SAME TIME

The Humvee strikes the surface bottom with an ominous thud.

EXT. MOUNTAINOUS ROAD - DAWN

The Jeep jerks to a stop. A door opens and the bodies of the

two Italians, shot dead, are dumped out into the mud.

Steve is alone now. Just him and the millions in gold.

INT. HUMVEE - SAME TIME

The water entombs them. Blood from Bridger's fatal gunshot

mists the water red.

They manage to get the door open. They start to swim out but

Charlie won't go without Bridger. He grabs his friend's body

and pulls it up with him.

EXT. RIVER - SUNRISE

They drag themselves ashore, Handsome Rob helping Charlie

pull Bridger's corpse. Charlie is shocked, tormented, grieved,

and angry beyond description. Against the rocky embankment,

he holds Bridger. Not wanting to ever let go.

INT. OFFICE - DAY

SOMEONE'S POV. A top of the line safe. The only light in the

office is the beam of a penlight on the dial.

GLOVED HANDS spin the dial, feeling for "contact points",

areas on the dial where a slight resistance can be felt --

if you have the touch.

NEW ANGLE. A woman holds the penlight in her teeth while

trying to crack the safe. It's Stella Bridger, now 30.

SUPERIMPOSE:

She manipulates the dial. Click. She grabs the safe's lever

and swings the heavy steel door open, her face a mixture of

pride and relief. But before we see what's inside -- LIGHTS

TURN ON.

TWO COPS lurk at the doorway.

The cops come closer and only now do we realize that they're

on the same team.

And as she walks off, they do look -- at her.

EXT. STREET - DAY

A car RISES INTO FRAME on a bustling street: a 1960 Mini

Cooper S., a worldwide motoring icon. Its shape crouches low

to the ground and its tiny 10-inch wheel-at-each-corner gives

it the legendary Mini look.

If when you see its headlights and classic grille it doesn't

bring a smile to your face, then you've got no automobile

soul.

INT. MINI (CRUISING) - DAY

Stella takes on the road like someone who loves to be behind

the wheel of a car that claimed victory in the Monte Carlo

Rally three times. She passes a minivan, a breeze with the

Mini's quick, go-kart-like handling.

She searches for a parking space on a street lined with SUVs.

Sees a spot, it's not really a space, just a gap between two

gas guzzlers, there's no way any car could squeeze in.

Brake. Shift. Hard turn. She parallel parks the Mini with

ease. She's right in front of --

HER SHOP

Antique keys and locks dominate the storefront window with

the name of the shop stenciled across the glass: BRIDGER

LOCK AND SAFE COMPANY. Stella hops out of the Mini. With a

poised walk she heads inside.

INT. SHOP - DAY

It is filled with old cast-iron safes she has rebuilt along

with some new models. Stella's RECEPTIONIST greets her.

High-five.

Without a response, Stella heads over to --

HER OPEN OFFICE DOOR

and sees him fiddling with her collection of safe doors that

line the shelves.

He turns around. Smiles. Charming.

She steps inside.

At first it seems that Charlie's words have no effect on

her, but then he notices that her hands are trembling.

She doesn't answer.

She doesn't respond. Doesn't ask him to go on, doesn't ask

him not to. So he goes on...

Stella remembers him.

That sets her off.

EXT. STREET  DAY

Charlie comes out of her shop and starts down the sidewalk.

Suddenly, Handsome Rob appears out of the crowd and is walking

next to him.

Handsome Rob stops Charlie.

INT. EXPENSIVE RESTAURANT/BAR - NIGHT

RICHARD WORTH has his back to the bar. He's a blue blood

trial lawyer with an ego that has more horsepower than a

Ferrari.

He gives a sideways glance to Stella; it's their first date.

What a nightmare. Someone bumps into Stella, a mumbled,

"Excuse me." Nightmare continues...

A waitress is indeed looking below Richard's belt. But Stella

notices that she was only looking because Richard's zipper

is all the way down. She smiles.

Suddenly a BUSBOY stumbles and a tray of drinks fall, soaking

Richard's suit in red wine.

He starts off to the bathroom and as soon as the space he

was occupying empties, Charlie fills it.

She shoots him a look that could reverse global warming.

Charlie returns her wallet.

She means it, too.

Charlie looks away, lets her have her point. This whole thing

is getting pretty heated so when he turns back to her, he

uses a whole new approach. His emotions are genuine.

She feels the honesty in his words but before she can reply,

they're interrupted by --

He's back, red wine splotched on his suit.

But for now, Charlie is just staring at Richard, boring into

to him...

And with that, Charlie goes. Stella can't help but smile.

EXT. STELLA'S CONDO - NIGHT

She comes home, having shed her date.

INT. STELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

She goes through a drawer and pulls out a package she hasn't

looked at for years. She opens it.

Inside is the beautiful necklace that her father bought her

in Italy. It brings tears to her eyes.

INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

He lies in bed, can't sleep. His phone rings. He picks up.

INT. STELLA'S BEDROOM - INTERCUT

She's on the other end of the line.

EXT. STREETS - DAY

Stella's Mini passes, weaves, tucks in between cars. She

drives like a madman.

INT. MINI (SPEEDING)

Charlie feels like he's inside a video game.

She slaps the dashboard of her car.

She whips down the avenue.

She hangs a left.

EXT. STADIUM PARKING LOT - DAY

The Mini parks in the middle of the huge, empty lot that

surrounds Veterans Field, home of the Philadelphia Phillies.

INT. MINI

She looks around...

A Vespa pulls into the lot, headed their way. It's Lyle.

Charlie starts the introductions.

INT. DORM ROOM - NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY - 1999 - NIGHT

Below a Metallica poster, Lyle has fallen asleep on his desk.

His roommate, Napster creator SHAWN FANNING, recognizable in

his trademark baseball cap, sneaks a peek at Lyle's computer.

INT. MINI - DAY

And now they see a monster pick-up truck bouncing into the

lot, MUSIC THUMPING from its Alpine at ear-bleeding levels.

INT. GRAMMAR SCHOOL BATHROOM - 1990 - DAY

A 10 year old boy stands in front of a toilet in the stall.

BOOM! Water geysers out of the bowl and soaks him.

Some kids in the bathroom saw the whole thing.

INT. MINI - DAY

And now a RUMBLING in the distance. Stella looks. Sees a car

streaking their way, almost like a mirage in the heat waves

coming off the pavement. Closer. Faster. A classic Mustang.

Its engine rumbles like a jackhammer. It's had some serious

custom work done to it.

EXT. L.A. FREEWAY - 1999 - DAY

Handsome Rob's behind the wheel, flicks a cigarette butt out

his open window --

We watch it hit the pavement, ashes spark, and then behind

the fallen butt we see that every lane of the 405 is filled

with cop cars in pursuit.

We now see Handsome Rob through the lens of a TV news

helicopter camera.

INT. MINI - DAY

As the cars converge in the parking lot...

INT. GRAMMAR SCHOOL PLAYGROUND - DAY

SEVEN YEAR OLD CHARLIE is shoved against a chain link fence

by a SIXTH GRADE BULLY.

Charlie hands the bully a dollar bill. The bully puts it in

a wallet that is over-stuffed with cash and saunters off,

laughing it up with his bully pals. Charlie turns to his 2nd

grade classmate who sports a fresh black eye.

Charlie holds up the over-stuffed wallet that he pickpocketed

from the bully.

EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

Doors open simultaneously. Everyone out. The crew eyes Stella.

Charlie gets right down to business.

Handsome Rob hands out fake driver's licenses.

Half-Ear hands out new cell phone to everyone and takes their

old phones.

As Charlie hands out airline tickets --

Lyle and Half-Ear have been kept in the dark until now.

They're a little stunned at first.

MONTAGE - LAX - NIGHT

The crew deplane from five different airplanes, different

air carriers.

They disperse in separate vehicles. See Charlie at Avis,

renting a car.

See Handsome Rob renting a U-Haul panel truck.

See Stella on a hotel shuttle bus.

See Half-Ear on the underground Metro Rail, taking the Red

Line.

See Lyle in a taxi, headed south on Figueroa Street. He

notices a YOUNG WOMAN HITCHHIKING. For a moment, their eyes

connect. She is a beautiful waif and the feeling sweeps

through Lyle: if only... But the taxi passes by.

Charlie checks into Shutters, with its Victorian beach house

feel and oceanfront view.

Stella's at the Peninsula in Beverly Hills with its opulent

lobby.

Handsome Rob's at the Standard, with its kitschy decor and

ironic style. He stares at a huge empty aquarium behind the

front desk where a performance artist writhes and a DJ spins

out rhythmic throbs. Very L.A.

Half-Ear's at the new Renaissance Hollywood Hotel adjacent

to the dramatic Babylon Gate and the Kodak Theatre.

And Lyle's at the Downtown Bonaventure, riding up the glass

elevator. Perfect gearhead hotel.

EXT. SHUTTERS HOTEL - BALCONY - SUNSET

The five of them sit in chairs on the balcony of his hotel

room. There's a sweeping view of the Pacific.

Out over the ocean, the sun is in its death throes, bruising

the sky a coiling purple and orange.

EXT. STEVE'S HOUSE - MORNING

Nestled at the end of a cul-de-sac on Oporto Drive in the

Hollywood Hills. Chrome. Glass. Carved wood.

EXT. MARAVILLA DRIVE - MORNING

The U-Haul panel truck is parked on the side of the road

that overlooks Oporto Drive and Steve's house.

INT. U-HAUL - MORNING

It's been converted into their surveillance vehicle, the

back outfitted with monitors and surveillance equipment.

Half-Ear peers through binoculars and says his notes into a

micro-cassette recorder. His binoculars focus in on the fence

that surrounds the perimeter of the property.

The binoculars SWISH PAN TO a guard booth where a guard keeps

an eye on the gate.

The binoculars SWISH PAN TO four Rottweilers prowling the

grounds.

EXT. 101 FREEWAY - DAY

A sea of cars, gridlock in L.A. Crammed in the middle of the

traffic meltdown is Handsome Rob's rental car.

INT. RENTAL CAR (CRAWLING)

Timing out the getaway route. He's got a Thomas Guide on the

passenger seat and a stopwatch ticking away but he's going

nowhere fast. He futilely leans on the car horn.

INT. U-HAUL - DAY

Lyle's surveillance shift. He takes digital photos with a

telephoto camera. ZOOMS IN on a security pad on the front

door.

INT. STEVE'S HOUSE - OFFICE - DAY

A HAND turns the dial to a Worthington 1000 vault. The vault

opens and voila: stacks and stacks of gold bricks.

EXT. STEVE'S HOUSE -DAY

The same hand clutches a very heavy duffle bag. OUR VIEW

BOOMS UP to see Steve, three years older than when we last

saw him, his beard shaved away.

INT. U-HAUL - SAME TIME

Through his digital camera lens, Lyle watches Steve walk

towards his car: a Ferrari 550 Barchetta Pininfarina. It's

the first time he's seen Steve in three years.

Lyle watches the security guard hit a switch in the guard

booth. The gate rises like the blade of a guillotine in

reverse. The Ferrari zooms away.

EXT. FIGUEROA STREET - DAY

Another route. Handsome Rob's rental car is in the left turn

lane waiting for the light to change.

INT. RENTAL CAR

The light finally is a green arrow but the lady in front of

Handsome Rob is so preoccupied with applying her make-up

that she doesn't go until he honks but by then it's too late

as she makes it through the light but he doesn't.

He checks his stopwatch. Simmers.

EXT. PENINSULA HOTEL - POOLS SIDE - DAY

In a bikini, Stella lies on a lounge chair under a cabana,

reading a copy of Vogue magazine.

But as we take a closer look, we see that she's really reading

the owner's manual for the Worthington 1000 safe which she's

inserted in the fold of Vogue.

INT. U-HAUL - DAY

Charlie's shift. He sees a Latina housekeeper get into her

car.

EXT. COIN & BULLION STORE - EVENING

Steve bangs a fist against the steel security door that covers

the closed store. The steel door rises up and a Ukrainian

named YEVHEN unlocks another door. He is the gold dealer

that Philly Steak told Charlie about.

INT. COIN & BULLION STORE - EVENING

Yevhen is 50 and like many in the gold trade, there isn't a

conspiracy theory that he doesn't embrace. As they make their

way to a back room, he keeps his mouth in overdrive --

Steve motions to a security camera that looms down on them.

Steve sees the red light is off. He lays the duffel bag on a

table, unzips it, pulls out three 25 pound gold bricks with

the face of a Balinese Girl stamped on each one. As Yevhen

inspects them --

Yevhen retrieves a briefcase, opens it, presenting Steve

with stacks of Ben Franklins: $100,000 worth. As Steve

inspects the cash --

Steve closes the briefcase.

EXT. 7TH STREET - NIGHT

A fender bender in the middle of an intersection has traffic

backed up for miles.

INT. RENTAL CAR

Handsome Rob checks the latest time on the stopwatch.

INT. U-HAUL - NIGHT

Through night-vision binoculars Charlie sees a (different)

security guard open the gate as Steve returns.

He watches Steve go inside his house. Through the windows,

he sees him use a remote to turn on a TV.

EXT. 101 FREEWAY - THE NEXT DAY

A freeway sign says: UNION STATION 1/2 MILE

INT. RENTAL CAR

HANDSOME ROB can see the exit up ahead, but traffic is so

backed up and going nowhere that it feels like it's a hundred

miles away. And it's not even rush hour. Just life in L.A.

Idling on the freeway, he looks at the drivers in the cars

beside him. He sees a businesswoman reading the Wall Street

Journal. Sees a man with his finger deep, deep up his nose.

EXT. YAMASHIRO RESTAURANT - DAY

Our crew walks along the pathways of Japanese gardens that

wind along outside the restaurant. It's a breathtaking view

from high in the Hollywood Hills. Some tourists take in the

vista.

They don't know where Charlie is going with this, but they've

been around him long enough to know it's going somewhere.

But Stella knows that's not exactly true. He doesn't think

Stella is dead; he doesn't know her at all.

EXT. ADELPHIA CABLE - PARKING LOT - EVENING

Service trucks pull into the lot. Technicians are getting

out, finishing their shifts.

INT. RENTAL CAR (PARKED NEARBY)

Handsome Rob behind the wheel. Lyle shotgun, aiming his

digital camera at the exiting workers.

They see a female service tech getting out of her work truck.

Lyle zooms his camera lens in on her Adelphia Cable work

shirt. It has BECKY sewn in above her right breast.

Lyle takes a few more pictures of Becky.

Lyle watches him stroll over to Becky and strike up a

conversation in the parking lot. Lyle can't hear what's being

said, but Becky smiles, and lest we forget, his name is

Handsome Rob for a reason.

INT. BECKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

OUR CAMERA FOLLOWS a trail of clothes, hastily littered,

that lead to the cable chick's bed. Lit candles are on the

bedside table. The couple is asleep under a tangle of sheets.

Handsome Rob has clearly mixed business with pleasure. His

eyes flash open.

He slips out of bed. Pulls on his pants. Reaches into her

pants and removes her key chain.

He selects the key to her service truck and does an old trick:

he blows out one of the candles and presses the key against

the warm wax, making a clear impression of the key's ridges.

He returns the key chain. Takes a couple more steps, past

her panties, past her bra and.

He snags her work shirt. Then he's gone.

INT. HANDSOME ROB'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

Using locksmith equipment, he cuts a key that matches the

impression on the candle wax.

EXT. ADELPHIA CABLE PARKING LOT - DAWN

Stella, wearing Becky's work shirt, arrives before any other

workers. Using the key Handsome Rob made, she unlocks the

door to the cable truck and gets in.

EXT. NEARBY STREET - MORNING

The cable truck pulls over. Charlie and Lyle climb into the

back where they can't be seen.

EXT. OPORTO DRIVE -MORNING

The cable repair truck pulls over, parking down the street

from Steve's house.

Charlie gets out. He quickly uses a crowbar to lift up a

sidewalk cement grate that says CABLE on it. Inside are cable

wires that feed the street. He crouches over and uses pliers

to disconnect one of the cables.

INT. STEVE'S HOUSE - MORNING

He drifts into the kitchen for a cup of coffee. He hits the

remote control for a TV. It turns on but there's nothing but

snow.

He goes into the living room and checks out the plasma TV.

The cable's not working in here, either. He hits an intercom

button on his telephone.

INT. GUARD HOUSE - INTERCUT

A SECURITY GUARD answers the intercom.

He finds the number and dials.

INT. CABLE TRUCK (PARKED) - MORNING

Lyle monitors a digital copy of the security guard's call

that's being routed to his laptop. Then he takes off his

headphones and tells Charlie and Stella:

Charlie dials a number on his cell phone.

INT. GUARD HOUSE - INTERCUT

The security guard answers the phone.

Charlie hangs up.

Lyle puts an American flag pin on her work shirt. Then he

hits keys on his laptop and an image pops up on his monitor

via an RF antenna: the POV of the pin.

Lyle hands her some papers.

Stella looks very tense.

Charlie seems amused by that answer.

Stella joins in with him...

They look at each other a moment... and smile.

INT. RENTAL CAR (MOVING) - DAY

While the others deal with the cable, Handsome Rob and Half-

Ear drive down Sunset.

They pull up in front of a strip joint.

Half-Ear pulls a switchblade out of his boot and puts it in

the glove compartment. Handsome Rob gives him a questioning

look.

INT. STRIP CLUB - DAY

Outside the doorway of a back room they're frisked by a BURLY

MAN. He's very thorough, digging hard into their crotches.

He opens the door to the --

INT. BACK ROOM

Where we meet SKINNY PETE, who is the FATTEST MAN YOU'VE

EVER SEEN. He takes up an entire couch in the rear of the

room.

His catcher's-mitt-sized hands motion them to come closer.

His voice is raspy, it's like a climbing-ten-floors-effort

just for this guy to get out the words.

The fattest man you've ever seen attempts a nod, triple-chins

colliding like a train wreck.

With his distended belly and bursting shirt, his eyes glazing

with repletion, Skinny Pete writes down an address.

INT. SECURITY GUARD BOOTH -DAY

Looking at a monitor, one of Steve's security guards sees

the Adelphia repair truck pull up to the gate. He hits a

button and the gate rises, beckoning it inside.

INT. CABLE TRUCK (MOVING)

Stella heads up the driveway, apprehension painted on her

features. Lyle is hidden in the back.

She parks next to the Ferrari and finds herself surrounded

by the four Rottweilers. They snarl and flash their teeth

outside her door until a shrill WHISTLE yanks their attention

to --

EXT. STEVE'S HOUSE

where Steve has just stepped out the front door. The dogs

immediately back off.

Stella gets out of the truck as Steve walks over, smiling at

her.

She comes face to face with the man who killed her father.

She's not sure she's going to be able to speak or pull this

off.

He holds out a hand.

She shakes his hand. She hates this, feeling his skin touch

hers, but she can't betray her feelings. He stands there a

moment.

INT. STEVE'S HOUSE - SAME TIME

She enters, moving her body to give the pinhole camera a

full sweep of the entryway.

INT. BACK OF THE CABLE REPAIR TRUCK - SAME TIME

Lyle watches Stella and Steve on his laptop via the pinhole

camera and hears them talking through his headphones.

INT. HALLWAY - INTERCUT

Steve leads Stella down the marbled hall...

They step into the --

He stares at her as she bends down...

She tries her best to ignore his flirtatious stare and his

words.

INT. BACK OF THE CABLE TRUCK - DAY

Lyle sees a perfect view of the main hallway as Stella walks

down it.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

He escorts her inside. She works on the cable connection to

the plasma TV. Finishes.

EXT. OPORTO DRIVE - SAME TIME

Back at the spot where Charlie disconnected the cable.

Wearing a headset with a mic, he gets the word from Lyle --

Charlie reconnects the cable just as --

INT. LIVING ROOM

Steve turns on the TV and the picture is --

Steve stares at her a moment.

She's hoping to get out as quickly as she can.

She hands him the paperwork and a pen. He signs it.

He's being charming, and she has to act like he is being

charming, but she really wants to throw-up.

INT. CABLE TRUCK (MOVING) - DAY

Stella drives in heavy traffic down Sunset. Charlie and Lyle

are in the back.

Stella keeps her eyes forward, on the road, so Charlie and

Lyle can't see her face. But Charlie catches her reflection

in the rearview mirror and watches a tear glide down her

cheek. She wipes it away.

EXT. HOUSING PROJECTS - NIGHT

A different world. A different vibe. That feeling in the

gut: you don't belong here.

INT. RENTAL CAR (MOVING)

Handsome Rob drives, Half-Ear in the passenger seat.

They pull over in front of the apartment building that Pete

sent them to.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Half-Ear hits the buzzer for the apartment number on the

paper from the fat man. The door to the building buzzes in

response and they go inside.

INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Climbing stairs. From behind closed doors: TVs, crying babies,

violent yelling. They start down a hallway. Ahead of them a

door opens and a suitcase is put in front of the doorway.

The door closes. They don't even get a glance at whomever is

inside.

They go to the suitcase. Half-Ear clicks open the lock for

just a peek. He sees the goods.

Handsome Rob starts to slide an envelope of cash under the

door frame. Its sucked out of his hand by someone on the

other side of the door and disappears.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Half-Ear carefully deposits the suitcase into the trunk of

the rental car. Handsome Rob closes the trunk.

They get into the car.

INT. RENTAL CAR

Handsome Rob keys the ignition.

The beam of his headlights illuminate TWO HOMEBOYS. TWO MORE

step out of the shadows, one right up to the passenger's

door window. That one taps a 9 MM against the glass.

Half-Ear lowers the window. The homeboy pats one hand against

the faux-leather inside of the door, his other hand clutches

the weapon.

The homeboy, bugging on crank, is not one to be fucked with.

Handsome Rob takes the trunk key off the chain and passes it

over to Half-Ear... who nervously drops it onto the carpeted

floor.

Half-Ear reaches down for the key... but in the flash of an

eye... moving so fast it almost doesn't register... we see

him yank his switchblade from his boot, unleash its blade,

and stab it down into the homeboy's hand. The knife goes

through his hand and lodges into the faux-leather interior

of the door.

The homeboy suffers as Half-Ear whacks the gun out of his

other hand -- while Handsome Rob keys the ignition and guns

it.

The other homeboys are already POPPING OFF SHOTS at the car

with semi-automatic handguns. Half-Ear hits the deck. Glass

shatters.

INT. TRUNK OF THE CAR

Bullets slam into the trunk, illuminating the darkness with

streaks of light from the bullet holes. They barely miss the

suitcase filled with explosives.

EXT. RENTAL CAR (MOVING)

The homeboy is still attached to the car door by the knife.

His legs scurry to keep up with the moving vehicle but it's

going too fast so pretty soon he's being dragged. Bullets

whiz by him. He cries out in agony until Half-Ear has the

time to yank out the knife and the homeboy rolls away on the

pavement.

The car makes a sharp right at the next block and pulls over.

The U-Haul is waiting for them.

They get out of the rental car and open its trunk. Half-Ear

sees the bullet holes that surround the suitcase. An inch

closer and they would've been a crater.

INT. U-HAUL - NIGHT

They get in with the suitcase. Charlie is behind the wheel,

he's been waiting for them. He hits the gas. They take off,

leaving the shot-up rental car behind.

INT. CHARLIE'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

An edited loop of the exterior and interior of Steve's house

plays on Lyle's laptop. The crew is huddled around.

Lyle doesn't answer.

Handsome Rob leans over to Charlie.

The video that Stella got of the hallway plays on the laptop.

Lyle calculates:

OUR VIEW PUSHES IN FAST on Stella.

MINI COOPER (MOVING) - DAY

She's driving. Pure concentration. Then:

Tires spinning over a marble floor. Then:

The sideview mirrors scraping wallpaper. Then:

The thin car is like a missile firing RIGHT DOWN STEVE'S

HALLWAY, a hair-raising fit.

INT. CHARLIE'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

Her idea brings a smile to her face.

Handsome Rob likes it.

EXT. CAR RENTAL COMPANY - DAY

Parked in the lot are shimmering Supercharged Mini Coopers,

a new model that still captures the legendary Mini look and

feel.

Half-Ear climbs in one Mini. Lyle into another.

INT. CAR RENTAL COMPANY - SAME TIME

In the background, a large window overlooks the lot.

Handsome Rob fills out the paperwork on the Mini he's renting

while flirting with a petite COUNTER BABE.

At the same time, in the background, we see Lyle and Half-

Ear's Mini pull out of their parking spaces and BACK RIGHT

INTO EACH OTHER. Just a little bumper hit.

They get out of their cars and start yelling at each other.

EXT. YEVHEN'S COIN & BULLION STORE - NIGHT

Steve bangs a fist against the steel security door that covers

the closed store. The steel door rises up and once again

Yevhen unlocks another door.

INT. YEVHEN'S COINS & BULLION STORE - NIGHT

It doesn't seem to matter if Steve's in a hurry or not, Yevhen

still runs at the mouth while heading into the back room.

Steve puts his duffel bag down on the table. It THUDS. Once

again, he pulls out three gold bricks that each weigh 25

pounds.

Steve cocks his head, as if he could not have heard right.

Steve looks up to the security camera.

Yevhen sweats a bit.

Yevhen smiles quizzically, not sure if he's being complimented

or insulted.

Before the words are out of Yevhen's mouth, Steve grabs one

of the 25 pound gold bricks and slaps it across Yevhen's

face, shattering his jaw.

Yevhen's falls to the floor and Steve lifts the brick again

and rams it down onto his head with an ugly THUD.

And again.

And again.

He then takes the gold brick -- slathered in blood -- and

places it back in his duffle bag.

INT. YEVHEN'S COINS & BULLION STORE - TEN MINUTES LATER

Yevhen's Ukrainian cousin, MASHKOV, stares down at the corpse.

Steve is long gone.

Mashkov kneels down by the body and starts sobbing.

INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

Mashkov walks through a living room, past some lighting

equipment and a video camera and we get just enough of a

look to realize that a porno is being shot here but he

couldn't care less as he makes his way into the kitchen where --

His boss, DANYA, 60, the owner of this house, is eating a

bowl of Frosted Flakes at the kitchen table. They speak in a

colloquial Ukrainian tongue that we SUBTITLE.

They stop talking for a moment as one of the "ACTRESSES"

comes in, plops herself down next to Danya and pours herself

a bowl of cereal. She puts her hand on Danya's leg. She's

young and it's a disturbing image and we RECOGNIZE HER: she's

the HITCHHIKER who Lyle passed in the taxi ride down Figueroa

Street when he first arrived in L.A.

Danya goes back to speaking SUBTITLED UKRAINIAN.

Danya laughs pleasantly.

But as she eats her cereal, we see a troubled, sad look on

her face.

INT. RENTED WAREHOUSE - DAY

The three Minis are parked inside: one red, one white, one

blue. Handsome Rob and Stella are doing custom work under

the hoods. Lyle is wearing the strap-on laptop and typing

away. Half-Ear squeezes silver Haliburton suitcases into the

Minis' trunks as Charlie enters --

He pulls a blanket off a Vespa. Lyle points at Half-Ear.

EXT. TRAFFIC CONTROL CENTER - NIGHT

Housed in a towering building on the corner of Olympic and

Grand in the heart of downtown L.A. OUR VIEW RISES UP to the

rooftop, where WE FIND Charlie and Lyle.

OUR VIEW MOVES IN CLOSER on Charlie, who adroitly picks the

lock to an access door and they climb down a short set of

steps into the

INT. MAINTENANCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS SHOT

From an equipment bag, Charlie pulls out a silent power drill

and uses it to remove an access panel from the AC vent.

INT. AIR-CONDITIONING VENT - NIGHT

Charlie leads, crawling through this tight space, his path

illuminated by the thin beam of a penlight.

INT. TRAFFIC CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

A high-tech setting with a half-dozen workers overseeing the

large traffic information monitors that display multiple

images.

OUR CAMERA PUSHES IN on the wall of monitors and then

BLACKNESS as OUR VIEW CROSSES to the --

OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL

Where the 70" tall mainframe computers are housed and running.

We see that the AC vent to this room is now open since Charlie

and Lyle have already snuck inside.

They move fast. Charlie removes the rear panels of the

mainframes while Lyle adeptly hard-wires his laptop into the

computers. The laptop's screen lights up.

Charlie fits two false panels where the rear panels of the

mainframes used to be. Lyle pulls an innocent looking filing

box out of his equipment bag. He places the box on a nearby

shelf where it enjoys line-of-sight to the false panels.

He punches a key on his laptop and the false panels and the

filing box quietly clicks into action, communicating with

his laptop via infrared. His laptop now shows a guiltwork of

thumbnail views from the traffic information monitors.

Typing commands, Lyle is clearly operating on a higher

bandwidth than the rest us.

There.

He hits the ENTER button.

INT. THE PANTRY RESTAURANT - DOWNTOWN L.A. - DAY

Their motto: "Never closed. Never without a customer!" The

place has the same decor as it did 75 years ago. It's also a

spot where everyone minds their own business. One of the OLD

TIME WAITERS leads OUR CAMERA to a table in the back where

Mashkov sits across from a LAPD HOMICIDE DETECTIVE. He slides

over an envelope of cash and a photograph of Karen.

The detective checks out the photo.

INT. RENTED WAREHOUSE - DAY

Handsome Rob does some final tune-ups on the Minis.

Half-Ear loads a triple charger chemical grenade into a

launcher.

Charlie steps into the U-Haul which is parked in here...

INT. U-HAUL

Lyle is fixing glitches on his computer program. Stella is

doing her nails. Charlie looks at her.

Square tips have a more even surface area. Better grip, no

slipping.

INT. STEVE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

He's getting dressed for his date. We can tell by the way he

preens in front of the three sided full length mirror,

adorning himself in the most expensive fashion, that he is a

vain and arrogant man.

EXT. RENTED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

The three Minis pull out of the warehouse and head off down

the road. The U-Haul follows.

INT. CHARLIE'S MINI (MOVING) - NIGHT

Leading the pack. He wears a headset and mic.

INT. HANDSOME ROB'S MINI (MOVING) - NIGHT

He drives, Half-Ear in the passenger seat.

INT. STELLA'S MINI (MOVING) - NIGHT

She follows behind Handsome Rob's Mini.

INT. U-HAUL (MOVING) - NIGHT

Lyle drives. His Vespa is parked in the cargo bay with his

equipment.

EXT. STEVE'S DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

Looking sharp, Steve gets into his Ferrari.

EXT. OPORTO DRIVE - NIGHT

The U-Haul is idling on the side of the street about a mile

down from Steve's house. The Vespa is parked behind it.

From up ahead, we see the Ferrari cruising down the winding

road. As it passes by.

INT. U-HAUL

Lyle speaks into his headset:

EXT. OPORTO DRIVE - NIGHT

From side streets, the Minis converge on the road and head

up towards Steve's house.

INT. CHARLIE'S MINI (MOVING) - NIGHT

He can feel the adrenaline already starting to course through

is body.

He takes a sharp curve... and the moment that Steve's house

should come into view... he hits the brakes, his expression

turning to complete surprise.

HIS POV

The neighbor across the street from Steve is having the

biggest party in town. The road is filled with parked cars

and arriving guests. Ain't no way they're blowing the gate,

launching chemical grenades or in any way robbing Steve's

house in the midst of this.

CHARLIE'S FACE

As he takes this in, there's a KNOCK on the window. He turns.

Sees a uniformed VALET. Rolls down the window.

EXT. OPORTO DRIVE - NIGHT

We see the three Minis pull tight U-turns and head back the

way they came.

INT. CHARLIE'S MINI (MOVING) - NIGHT

He slaps his hand against the steering wheel, fuming.

INT. STELLA'S MINI (MOVING) - INTERCUT

She already knows what he's going to say.

INT. AGO RESTAURANT - NIGHT

A posh restaurant. As OUR CAMERA FINDS Stella and Steve, she

is laughing at something he said, faking her way through the

date. They're sitting at an intimate table.

He takes the lie like the compliment she wants him to think

it is.

That saying strikes Steve.

He looks at her closely, really closely.

This worries her. Because of course, she used to hear it

from her father.

Under the table, he grabs her by the wrist, squeezes it like

a vise.

Steve's voice is calm, so at ease that watching them you'd

think this was pleasant dinner conversation.

Stella intentionally knocks over a glass of wine. It shatters

on the floor. An emergency signal...

Charlie, Half-Ear, Handsome Rob and Lyle appear around the

table.

Steve is shocked to see the men he left for dead three years

ago standing before him, very much alive.

They pull up chairs from another table, encircling him for a

tense and pointed talk.

Half-Ear furtively slides the switchblade out of his boot.

Charlie grabs a bread stick off the table and goes. The others

follow.

INT. STRIP CLUB - BACK ROOM - NIGHT

The door bursts open as the burly man we met earlier is

dragged inside at gunpoint. Five Ukrainians armed with MAC-

11 machine pistols storm the room where Skinny Pete works.

Mashkov walks behind the posse. He carries a duffel bag. He

takes in the sight of the fattest man he's ever seen.

Mashkov nonchalantly opens the duffel bag and pulls out a

short-handled ax. Skinny Pete sees dried blood on the blade.

EXT. SHUTTER'S ON THE BEACH - MORNING

The sun shines over the ocean and the hotel.

INT. CHARLIE'S HOTEL ROOM

The crew is gathered. Lyle, monitoring digital surveillance

on his laptop, takes off his headphones.

He might as well have said they'll steal the Holy Grail before

sunrise.

Charlie hums with focused energy. There's a term for it in

horse racing. When a thoroughbred is at peak condition, and

twitching with eagerness to run, he is "on the muscle." That

describes Charlie right now.

They're interrupted by Charlie's cell phone RINGING. This

throws them all off.

It's still RINGING. Charlie decides to answer it.

INT. OFFICE - PHILADELPHIA - INTERCUT

Meet PHILLY STEAK. Or at least meet the back of his neck.

Because that's where he has a tatoo that says PHILLY STEAK.

OUR CAMERA TRACKS AROUND to Philly Steak's face which is

weathered and as leathery as a football. An old school crook.

INT. SAFE HOUSE - MORNING

Speaking of -- Five Ukrainians lock 'n load their MAC-11

machine pistols plus an M4 carbine with a 40mm grenade

launcher mounted beneath the barrel. Mashkov enters the room

and tells the others in SUBTITLED UKRAINIAN.

INT. DANYA'S HOUSE - MORNING

The home where the porno was made. Karen, wearing a backpack

stuffed with her only belongings, creeps into the kitchen

with two 3/4" videotapes in hand.

She sets them down on the counter. They say MASTER TAPE on

the labels. She opens the microwave oven. Puts the tapes

inside. Sets the timer for 60 minutes at the highest level

and presses the start button.

As the videotapes start to cook, we watch Karen flee out the

door.

EXT. HOLLYWOOD AT HIGHLAND - DAY

The U-Haul is parked on the side of the noisy, congested

boulevard. A large metal sheet is now mounted on the side of

the panel truck.

HIGH ANGLE. Parked behind the U-Haul are two of the Minis

and Lyle's Vespa. We see traffic flowing through the busy

intersection next to the vehicles. Then WE BOOM DOWN, really

fast, right into the black pavement and --

THROUGH THE DARKNESS and out the other side, so we are now

underground in the middle of the --

METRO RAIL TUNNEL

where Half-Ear is at work, mounting Nitramon primer to the

tunnel walls, Charlie assisting. They both wear orange

jumpsuits, plus headsets and mics.

There's a RUMBLING SOUND in the distance.

The RUMBLING grows unbearable as a Metro roars closer,

headlights gobbling up the dark tunnel. They press themselves

into a crevice in the wall.

With a ROAR and a gust of wind, the Metro howls by. It makes

their jaws clatter.

INT. U-HAUL (PARKED) - DAY

Stella's in the cargo area with Lyle who's working his laptop.

It's monitor displays a string of computer code. He HEARS

over his headset:

EXT. MARAVILLA DRIVE - SAME TIME

Handsome Rob's Mini is parked on the side of the winding

road. Using binoculars, he looks down onto Oporto Drive at

Steve's house. Into his headset:

INT. METRO RAIL TUNNEL - DAY

The Nitramon is applied. Half-Ear closes his eyes. Charlie

observes him a moment.

Another moment, then Half-Ear sets to work. Charlie holds a

mini-flashlight, illuminating the intricate detonator. Very

carefully, he inserts a wire into a tube. Remember, the wire

must not touch the sides.

The wire is half-way in when a LARGE SPIDER drops onto his

hand. Frozen, he ponders this.

Charlie sees the spider, doesn't know what to do.

Half-Ear studies the spider... then he closes his eyes just

a moment... relaxes... breathes in, breathes out... and then --

He leans forward, opens his mouth and clamps his lips over

the spider, comes back up. Finishes inserting the wire.

Job done, he calmly opens his mouth. The spider puts a hairy

leg out and delicately explores his cheek. Half-Ear plucks

it off just as delicately, depositing the spider on the wall.

Charlie just shakes his head in disbelief.

EXT. OPORTO DRIVE -DAY

A Brink's truck climbs the road towards Steve's house, flanked

by two BMW K1200LTA motorcycles.

EXT. MARAVILLA DRIVE - SAME TIME

Through binoculars, Handsome Rob is still keeping an eye on

Steve's house from the higher vantage point.

HIS POV

The front gate rises. The Brink's truck and motorcycles are

let inside and head up the driveway.

But then he sees a SECOND ARMORED truck drive up, also guarded

by two motorcycles. And a third Brink's followed by

motorcycles turns into the driveway.

EXT. STEVE'S HOUSE

It's a convoy of matching armored trucks...

EXT. MARAVILLA DRIVE - DAY

Witnessing the twist of events through his binoculars. He

speaks into his headset mic --

INT. U-HAUL - INTERCUT

The rest of the crew is now all in the U-Haul. Lyle's manning

the laptop.

EXT. STEVE'S HOUSE - (TIME CUT) - DAY

The caravan of armored trucks and motorcycles now head down

the driveway. The Ferrari follows behind.

EXT. MARAVILLA DRIVE - DAY

Handsome Rob sees the vehicles head east on Oporto. He reports

into his mike:

INT. U-HAUL

Maddening frustration.

Charlie is just as frustrated... but in a tight spot he always

comes up with an idea.

Lyle hits a command key and we now see the intersection of

Woodrow Wilson Drive and Cahuenga where vehicles are driving

under the traffic signal that a traffic video camera is

mounted to.

EXT. CAHUENGA BOULEVARD - DAY

The first armored truck makes its way through the green light.

INT. U-HAUL

Lyle hits the keyboard and lines of measurements appear across

the image of the Brink's truck. He strikes another key,

momentarily FREEZING the image. He makes a visual check of

the top of the armored truck against the Cahuenga Boulevard

street sign.

He unfreezes the first image just in time to check out the

next armored truck in line. FREEZE. The top of this truck

also lines up perfectly with the top of the street sign.

EXT. CAHUENGA BOULEVARD - SAME TIME

The third Brink's truck makes its way through the

intersection, the Ferrari behind it.

INT. U-HAUL - SAME TIME

The third Brink's comes into the monitor's view. FREEZE.

The top of the truck is below the top of the street sign.

EXT. CAHUENGA - SAME TIME

We see the truck with the California plate AWP82092. OUR

VIEW RISES UP until we're looking at an AERIAL VIEW as the

three armored trucks and their motorcycles fan out in three

different directions, with the Ferrari going in a fourth

direction.

EXT. HOLLYWOOD AT HIGHLAND - DAY

Handsome Rob pulls up in his Mini and parks behind the other

Minis.

INT. U-HAUL - SAME TIME

Charlie gives the command.

Lyle executes, hitting a series of keys and --

INT. MAINFRAME COMPUTER ROOM - SAME TIME

inconspicuous on a shelf, the dummy file box CLICKS into

action. In response, the false panels on the mainframes HUM

to life and in the adjacent --

TRAFFIC CONTROL CENTER

The mosaic of traffic screens SPIRAL INTO DARKNESS.

The workers can't believe it. They start hitting their

keyboards trying to get the system up and running again. But

it's useless since --

INT. U-HAUL

Lyle controls the system now. A single mouse click loads his

new algorithm into the computer and --

SERIES OF RAPID-FIRE SHOTS

All the traffic signals in Hollywood turn green

simultaneously.

EXT. INTERSECTIONS

See cars collide into each other. See a domino line of rear-

end crashes. A motorcycle tumbling over.

INT. TRAFFIC CONTROL CENTER

The stymied workers watch helplessly.

INT. U-HAUL

Lyle quickly types out some words and

INT. TRAFFIC CONTROL CENTER

The workers see the words form on the giant screens:

EXT. MORE INTERSECTIONS

The traffic lights turn RED simultaneously. Then all turn

GREEN. Then RED again.

It's demolition derby time. Daisy-chains of wrecks. Cars

spinning like hockey pucks. Total traffic meltdown.

INT. KNX-AM 1070 TRAFFIC HELICOPTER - DAY

Sweeping over a panoramic view of the greatest traffic jam

in L.A.'s history is traffic anchor CHRISTINA GRIEGO. She

reports what she sees:

INT. FERRARI

They're blocked in solid ahead and behind.

He turns on the radio as --

INT. U-HAUL

Lyle's fingers dance across the keyboard.

INT. GOLD TRUCK

Stuck in the middle of it. The driver and guard, both armed,

are as confused as everyone else.

He sees a way out, a sudden opening on North. Highland.

INT. U-HAUL

Via a traffic video camera, Lyle sees on his laptop the gold

truck, followed by two motorcycles, making the turn onto

North Highland.

Lyle hits more keys.

EXT. GOLD TRUCK

It comes to the next intersection. Every light is stuck on

red -- except the left turn only signal which is green. No

choice. The truck takes it.

INT. U-HAUL

He's striking keys, an orchestral conductor, the crew his

audience.

EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD

Signals turn green, but only for three seconds, long enough

for one car to gun through it at a time.

At the same time, we see Charlie get out of the U-Haul and

climb into the first Mini. Stella gets into the second Mini.

Half-Ear joins Handsome Rob in the third.

INT. FERRARI - DAY

Steve gets the scoop over the radio. He can't believe it.

Steve knows who did that.

INT. CHARLIE'S MINI -DAY

Through his rearview mirror, Charlie eyes the gold truck

creeping closer.

THREE SHOTS

Starting their engines-with souped-up, throaty roars: Charlie;

Handsome Rob; Stella.

INT. U-HAUL

Lyle has hacked into the Metro Rail's Control System. Starts

his magic.

INT. METRO RAIL TUNNELS - SEVERAL SHOTS

A Metro is speeding through the Blue Line tunnel. Suddenly

it loses power and comes to an inglorious stop.

Another Metro stops on the Red Line.

Inside a Metro on the Westside Corridor as it stops; confused

passengers stare out the glass.

INT. U-HAUL

His laptop shows a group of still circles that represent the

stalled Metros.

EXT. WALK OF FAME

The three Minis jump the curb and drive right over the star-

lined sidewalk... Pedestrians throw themselves out of their

path... The cars run over Marilyn Monroe's star and the

flowers and candles left by fans... They make a sharp turn

down the cement stairs that lead to the Metro Rail platform.

At the same time --

EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD

The creeping gold truck is just about alongside the parked U-

Haul.

INT. U-HAUL

Through his sideview mirror, Lyle eyes the progress of the

gold truck. He gives the word:

INT. METRO RAIL STATION

The Minis roughly bounce down the second flight of stairs.

The sides of the cars scrape against the metal handrails.

Tourists, workers, all scamper away.

INT. U-HAUL

The gold truck getting closer.

INT. METRO RAIL STATION

The Minis land on the platform where everyone is waiting for

the next Metro.

Heads turn at the sight of these half-cars streaking by.

INT. U-HAUL

The gold truck is almost alongside the U-Haul.

INT. METRO RAIL STATION

Charlie's Mini flies off the platform and lands on the rail

line. The car's shocks take the hit.

The other Minis follow suit, off the platform, onto the rails.

THE MINIS

Drive past the spot where they put the Nitramon explosives.

INT. STELLA'S MINI

She brakes to a stop and braces herself as --

INT. HANDSOME ROB'S MINI

Half-Ear pulls out his hearing aid, hits the remote to a

detonator and --

EXT. HOLLYWOOD & HIGHLAND

The section of pavement that the gold truck sits on splits

apart. The road surface drops away. Smoke billowing up as

The BRINK'S TRUCK FALLS...

INT. METRO RAIL TUNNEL

Suddenly the street, the armored truck and daylight come

crashing down at us in a cloud of smoke and debris.

The truck's windshield implodes.

The Minis come to a stop. Half-Ear jumps out. Aims the grenade

launcher. FIRES.

INT. GOLD TRUCK

The triple charger chemical grenade sails in through the

windshield and explodes, knocking out the guards. The driver

slumps against the steering wheel, the horn BLARING under

his weight. At the same time:

INT. U-HAUL - ON THE CUT

Lyle hits a button on a remote control and --

EXT. U-HAUL

Clamps unlock, releasing the heavy steel sheet from the side

of the U-Haul. It SLAMS DOWN, neatly covering the gaping

hole in the road like a huge manhole cover.

EXT. HOLLYWOOD & HIGHLAND

The motorcycles following the Brink's come to a sudden stop.

The motorcycle guards watch the smoke clear. The armored

truck has vanished! Vaporized in the gridlock! Gone!

Pandemonium. People scatter. A man jumps out of his BMW and

sprints away from the explosion.

Lyle gets out of the U-Haul and runs to his getaway vehicle:

the Vespa. He's about to hop on, but something stops him...

The sight of the vacant, shimmering, 2002 BMW 750iL parked

just ahead, keys dangling from the ignition.

At the same time, the motorcycle guards climb off their bikes.

Draw semi-automatic handguns. Result: more madness Bystanders

flee.

The BMW tears out of there, Lyle behind the wheel.

INT. METRO RAIL TUNNEL - DAY

The rear door to the Brink's is open. Our crew sees the

Worthington 1000 inside.

Stella goes up to the imposing safe. Gives it a look of

momentary respect, then sets to work...

INT. KNX-AM 1070 TRAFFIC HELICOPTER - DAY

Christina Griego telling her radio audience:

INT. FERRARI

Hearing the news over the radio.

Steve slams the car into gear and jumps the sidewalk, passing

the gridlock. He hollers into a walkie-talkie --

EXT. STREETS - SERIES OF SHOTS

The motorcycle guards who were escorting the decoy trucks

hear Steve over their walkie-talkies. With squeals of rubber,

they turn around as one of the guards answers --

At the same time --

INT. METRO RAIL TUNNEL - DAY

Stella works the dial, feeling for contact points. And --

EXT. HOLLYWOOD & HIGHLAND - DAY

The two motorcycle guards fervently try to lift off the steel

sheet that dropped down from the U-Haul.

INT. METRO RAIL TUNNEL - DAY

They see daylight start to stream in from above as the steel

sheet slides a little.

We HEAR Stella's heart pounding in her ears. See the

perspiration on her fingertips.

EXT. HOLLYWOOD & HIGHLAND - DAY

The motorcycle guards strain, managing to shift the steel

sheet enough so they can see the armored truck below.

INT. METRO RAIL TUNNEL - DAY

CLOSE SHOTS on Stella's eyes, pure concentration. CLOSE SHOTS

on each number on the dial. Finally: CLICK.

She grabs the safe's lever and swings the sturdy steel door

open. She instinctively looks away.

So she does. Inside is a mountain of gold bricks...

EXT. HOLLYWOOD & HIGHLAND - MOMENTS LATER

The motorcycle guards heave, strain, finally getting the

steel plate off. But it's too late as --

INT. MINIS - SERIES OF SHOTS

Engines REV. Exhaust jets. Hands slam stick-shifts.

INT. METRO RAIL TUNNEL

The cars streak off deeper into the Metro Rail tunnel,

headlights bouncing off the walls.

INT. CHARLIE'S MINI (MOVING) - DAY

It's a rush cruising down the tunnel. Taking the Blue Line.

Leading the pack. But they're not home free yet.

EXT. 101 FREEWAY - DAY

Rush hour gridlock -- no problem. The Ferrari's 12 cylinder

massive 210 hp engine bellows as it hits 120 m.p.h. in the

breakdown lane.

A Highway Patrol car starts chasing after it, siren wailing.

INT. FERRARI (HAULING ASS) - DAY

Merging onto the 110 South, Steve sees the patrol car in hot

pursuit.

He shifts into sixth and suddenly this car is a rocket

blasting off, doing a 1/4 mile in 1.3 seconds, leaving the

patrol car far behind. At the same time --

INT. SAFE HOUSE - GARAGE

Mashkov and the other heavily armed Ukrainians climb into a

SUV. The garage door opens and the vehicle charges out of

there. And at the same time --

INT. METRO RAIL TUNNEL

The three Minis speed by UNDERNEATH OUR CAMERA in streaks of

red, white, and blue.

INT. CHARLIE'S MINI (MOVING)

He spots the proverbial daylight at the end of the tunnel.

EXT. FLOWER & PICO - DAY

Where the Blue Line rises up to ground level. The Minis

thunder into the daylight, past the above ground platform,

just as two motorcycles come flying around the corner after

them.

Picture this: two guards on each motorcycle with each man

seated behind the driver holding AK-47s in each hand, giving

them the appearance of having submachine guns growing out of

their shoulders.

Fingers go flat against the AK-47s triggers. Blowing SHOT

after SHOT at the Minis. BAM-BAM-BAM.

INT. CHARLIE'S MINI

In the teeth of gunfire. Bullets explode through the back

window in a cacophony of CRASHING GLASS. A shot wings his

door. POP! Into headset:

EXT. FLOWER & PICO

They head off in different directions through congested

downtown rush hour traffic.

One motorcycle takes off after Charlie's Mini. The other

goes after Handsome Rob's Mini. So Stella's free and clear

except that Steve's Ferrari is barreling down Pico and coming

after her.

INT. LAPD HELICOPTER (FLYING)

An LAPD PILOT swoops in, barking out instructions to police

cars converging on the scene.

EXT. CHARLIE'S MINI

Turning onto Exposition, the motorcycle in pursuit, the

chopper overhead.

His red Mini jumps a curve, now on a wide sidewalk,

accelerating full throttle for the horizon while pedestrians

flatten themselves against a high-rise in fear.

INT. CHARLIE'S MINI

He sees someone give him the finger. Mutters:

Meanwhile:

INT. HANDSOME ROB'S MINI

He's got the other motorcycle on his tail, RELENTLESS GUNFIRE

dogging his every move.

He shifts smooth as silk, squeezing between a car he's passing

and an oncoming car in the other lane. Half-Ear is trying

his best to remain calm but Jesus, that was close.

Suddenly, Handsome Rob veers off the road and WHAM. He takes

down a chain link fence and is now in the parking lot of

the:

EXT. CONVENTION CENTER

His white Mini catapults across the asphalt, the motorcycle

still right behind.

INT. HANDSOME ROB'S MINI

Up ahead, he eyes the open door entrance to the Convention

Center. Stomps the gas.

The turbine howls.

EXT. CONVENTION CENTER

The Mini squeezes through the doorway and into the --

INT. CONVENTION CENTER

It's the STAR TREK GRAND SLAM 2002 convention in full swing.

Display tables are lined up in the cavernous hall and the

Mini snakes through the maze and the Trekkies as --

The motorcycle follows right behind and the chase is really

on now.

THUDA THUD THUDA, the Mini's wheels climb a flight of steps.

Waves of people flee the path of the little car and --

THUD, THUDA, THUD, the motorcycle follows right behind.

The Mini zips down the wide Concourse Hall -- travels

underneath banners of Star Trek characters that hang from

the ceiling -- the motorcycle keeps up, tires tearing into

the carpeting.

INT. HANDSOME ROB'S MINI

He shifts, swerves, avoiding people, obstacles.

Handsome Rob turns, taking them down the --

WEST HALL

that stretches out toward the Staples Center.

WHIZ. The Mini goes by. WHIZ. The motorcycle goes by.

Then --

The Mini steamrolls through the exit doors and --

EXT. CONVENTION CENTER/STAPLES CENTER

It bounds down outdoor steps and ramps onto the outside

entrance to the Staples Center, fitting snugly between cement

pillars that are designed to keep regular-sized cars out.

INT. STAPLES CENTER - DAY

The Mini bulldozes through glass doors. Across the lobby.

Down an aisle that leads right to --

CENTER COURT

where OUR L.A. LAKERS are in the midst of practice. The Minis

do look like matchbox cars next to these towering players.

The car's tires leave a streak of rubber on the parquet floor.

The team clears a path. The car is off the court before they

know it.

But now the players see the motorcycle coming down the aisle.

See the guns. See security guards running after it.

KOBE BRYANT picks up a basketball.

The motorcycle charges across center court.

Kobe aims... hurls the ball. It RAMS into the motorcycle's

handlebars. The bike spins out of control and into a nasty

fall, spitting off the riders while --

EXT. STAPLES CENTER

The Mini crashes out the opposite side of the arena and glides

right through the L.A. Sports Arch of Fame before escaping

onto Figueroa. Meanwhile:

EXT. SOUTH ALAMEDA - DAY

The Ferrari is eating up the pavement as it hounds after

Stella. Two police cars are roaring after them both.

INT. STELLA'S MINI

She slaps the gears into action, maneuvers tight turns around

the cars in her path, just like she does at home with Jack

Daniels.

EXT. SOUTH ALAMEDA

A cop car tries to pass the same car as the Ferrari but

smashes into an oncoming vehicle. As it spins like a corkscrew --

EXT. FERRARI

The rear tires spin smoke and it launches like a missile

after the Mini.

INT. STELLA'S MINI

She keeps flooring it... the gauge rising... the customized

engine screaming...

But the Ferrari, like an unstoppable force, hangs menacingly

in her rearview mirror.

I/E FERRARI

Steve RAMS into the rear bumper of the blue Mini. The bumper

tears off, rolls across the pavement. The Ferrari is about

to make another charge.

INT. STELLA'S MINI

She yanks the wheel left to avoid the hit. Suddenly finds

herself in the path of an ARROWHEAD WATER TRUCK. She yanks

the wheel right to avoid a collision.

INT. ARROWHEAD WATER TRUCK

The truck driver hits the brakes, over compensating as he

turns away from the Mini and --

EXT. SOUTH ALAMEDA

The truck falls over onto its side, sending those big jugs

all over the road, water exploding into the air and --

The Ferrari crashes through the jugs, one rolling up the

hood and over the windshield, dousing it like a car wash.

The lane is blocked by the wreck. Steve makes a right turn.

The police cruiser hits the brakes but not fast enough. It

slams into the water truck.

EXT. 5TH STREET

Steve turned onto a one-way street and he's going the wrong

way. A Jeep Wrangler almost runs into him head-on but both

cars stop just in time.

The DRIVER of Wrangler, a muscular fire plug of a guy, jumps

out, furious.

As more invectives are hurled, Steve gets out of the Ferrari

and walks towards the furious driver.

BANG. Steve shoots the guy's foot.

While the furious driver hops on one leg, Steve gets into

the Wrangler and takes off, abandoning the Ferrari. At the

same time --

INT. BMW 750IL (MOVING) - SUNSET

Lyle's coasting down Exposition Boulevard towards Union

Station. Clear sailing for him.

He sees a young woman thumbing for a ride. It's Karen. And

he recognizes her: she was hitchhiking when he first arrived

in L.A. He pulls over. To Lyle, she might be an angel in the

empyrean if she wasn't, so completely, a woman.

EXT. FIGUEROA & OLYMPIC - DAY

Charlie's still having a helluva time getting rid of the

motorcycle. It screams like a Banshee as it streaks up

alongside the Mini. Charlie suddenly sees an AK-47 pointed

right at him.

INT. CHARLIE'S MINI

He jerks the steering wheel and swerves off the street,

driving through the parking lot of the historic Hotel

Figueroa.

With the motorcycle dogging his heels, he looks up at the

building. It has three towers that rise up 12 stories, with

a giant mural of Albert Einstein covering one of the towers

(it's an ad for Apple Computers: Think different.)

Suddenly the LAPD helicopter swoops down towards the parking

lot, shattering the air, blowing up dirt and discarded

newspapers in a rush of turbo-wash, trying to box in the

Mini.

INT. CHARLIE'S MINI

He's got no place else to go...

INT. HOTEL FIGUEROA

The Mini squeezes through the entrance and into the lobby

with its exotic Moroccan decor. Horrified guests catapult

out of the way. The Mini drives past wooden statues, potted

palm trees.

The motorcycle follows the car as it streaks towards the

elevator. Charlie looks back, sees the motorcycle. The

elevator door opens. Some tourists step off.

INT. ELEVATOR

The Mini darts right in, not an inch to spare. Charlie reaches

out the window, presses the button for ROOF.

He sees the motorcycle charging after him, burning rubber

across the beautiful tiled floor. Closer, closer.

The door closes just in time.

A second elevator opens, the motorcycle zooms inside, people

screaming at the sight of the guns.

EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY

The doors open, PING, and the Mini reverses out, spins.

LOOKING DOWN onto the building's rooftop, we see that it is

shaped like a capitol E, three towers connected by a narrow

strip. Each tower has its own elevator.

INT. CHARLIE'S MINI

He wants to drive across the rooftop strip but there's a big

problem: the giant sign that exclaims HOTEL FIGUEROA in red

and white neon lights blocks so much of the strip that even

the Mini couldn't squeeze through.

In his rearview, he sees the second elevator door open and

out comes the motorcycle. He's trapped up here. But he's not

about to abandon ship.

EXT. ROOFTOP

So he floors it, slaps the gears, hurtles to the edge of the

first tower and in --

EYE-POPPING CGI SLOW MOTION SHOTS

His car hurls into the wide blue empty space... The ground

deliriously distant... Spiraling through the air like a

football...

NEXT TOWER - ROOFTOP

The Mini lands right-side-up with a THUD. Charlie, rattled,

looks over his shoulder and sees the LAPD helicopter rising

over the rooftop, turbines SCREAMING.

And here comes the motorcycle. Flying from one section of

the rooftop to the next. It lands and the driver REVS it

forward --

I/E CHARLIE'S MINI

He speeds toward the edge of the roof and launches off towards

the third tower some twenty feet away. Lands. Keeps going to

the last elevator, skids to a stop.

He reaches out, punches the call button. Then looks over his

shoulder to witness --

THE MOTORCYCLE

going full throttle to make the final rooftop to rooftop

jump.

But its front wheel hits the edge slightly off-kilter...

It soars but with a slight downward trajectory...

Towards a large window on the top floor...

Then lower...

And the look on the driver's face says it all as...

The front wheel of the motorcycle SMACKS into the side of

the building, just below the window.

The guards are flung off the bike and their bodies CRASH

through the window as --

A hunk of exploding metal imbeds itself in the side of the

LAPD chopper and --

INT. HOTEL FIGUEROA

The guards land in the Tangier Suite in a hailstorm of glass

shards.

I/E. LAPD HELICOPTER

Smoke billows out where the hunk of metal hit. The pilot

keeps it under control but it's time to go. With a WHINING

THROB, the injured chopper banks away.

INT. HOTEL FIGUEROA LOBBY - DAY

PING. The elevator door opens. Charlie's Mini shoots out

then skids out the lobby's exit. He made it.

INT. STELLA'S MINI (SPEEDING) - DAY

She checks the rearview mirror. No sign of the Ferrari.

Just a Jeep Wrangler back there.

Stella looks relieved. Feels like she's home free.

EXT. UNION STATION - SUNSET

Stella's Mini pulls up to the ramp of the enclosed car carrier

at the end of Amtrak Train 59, bound for New Orleans.

She can see the other two Minis are already inside. She gets

out and hands the cargo loader a ticket.

EXT. UNION STATION - NIGHT

The "All Aboard" announcement goes out over the PA system.

Then the Superliner train pulls out of the station, quickly

picking up speed.

INT. FIRST CLASS CAR - NIGHT

The outside streaks by through the window. It's a happy crew.

Champagne is poured. Charlie holds up his glass and gets

their attention.

They all raise their glasses.

We PAN ACROSS their faces. It's been a three year odyssey

for them. They got the gold, but they lost someone they loved.

Clink.

INT. CAR CARRIER - NIGHT

OUR CAMERA MOVES past the three Minis parked inside...

And STOPS at the last car in the carrier -- the Jeep Wrangler.

Its rear hatch rises and Steve creeps out. Looks around.

It's safe.

He walks over to Stella's Mini. Pops open the trunk REVEALING

a silver Haliburton suitcase. He unzips the case.

It's filled with stacks and stacks of gold bricks, the exotic

face of a Balinese girl on each one.

Steve pulls out a brick, embraces it. He knows his gold.

These bricks are real.

But as he has a moment with his gold, BEHIND HIM, the trunks

of the other two Minis RISE in unison.

Then Mashkov RISES out of the trunk of the white Mini.

Another Ukrainian RISES out of the trunk of the blue Mini.

Four more Ukrainians slide out from underneath the Minis.

They cock their M-lls.

CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK.

Steve hears the sound from behind him. He turns around to

see the weapons pointed at him.

Steve has no choice.

The Ukrainians force Steve into the trunk of the white Mini.

And for the first time, he's scared. Looking up at Mashkov,

he begs.

The Ukrainians laugh. Steve tries to laugh.

And with that, he closes the trunk. THUD. Like the lid of a

coffin. And for Steve, the world falls into BLACKNESS.

INT. FIRST CLASS CAR - SAME TIME

Underneath the crew's seats, we see the other two silver

Haliburton suitcases filled with the rest of the gold. We

BOOM UP to our five thieves...

Handsome Rob passes out new fake driver's licenses for when

they arrive in New Orleans.

They're interrupted by the RING of Charlie's phone. He

answers.

INT. CAR CARRIER - INTERCUT

Mashkov is on the other end of the line.

During this, Lyle types commands into his laptop that is

connected to a phone jack in the car.

Lyle hits a final command and --

INT. ENGINEER ROOM - SAME TIME

signal box receives the command and --

EXT. CAR CARRIER - SAME TIME

The coupler between the car carrier and the rest of the train

is electronically disengaged.

This causes the train to separate from the car carrier. The

train speeds on without it at 100 miles per hour.

The car carrier slowly comes to a stop in the middle of

nowhere.

INT. DINING CAR - NIGHT

The Dining Car features crisp white linens and extended

windows for scenic dining. Lyle walks over to a table where

Karen is waiting for him. She looks resplendent.

He sits. And as OUR CAMERA HOLDS ON Lyle, ready to embark on

a new life, we --

CLOSER on the line of sunbathers... PANNING ACROSS their

faces -- and you'd never notice unless you were really,

really, looking for them... is it them?... CLOSER on the

pixels... and yes, it sure is... Charlie & Stella in lounge

chairs, living the good life.
