SCROLL OVER BLACK:

Antarctica. Six million square miles of ice.    The

coldest place on earth.

Forty-six countries have competing claims and maintain

outposts. The Antarctic Treaty holds these claims in

check.

There is no regular law enforcement. A single U.S.

Marshal is assigned to the territory.

END SCROLL

EXT.   ANTARCTICA - DAY

Snow-covered hills thrust up out of a barren, white

wasteland. No buildings, no animals... nothing.

CLOSER: The hills are more defined. Rows of jagged

peaks and a crazed pattern of crevasses. A fine `mist'

of wind-blown snow whips about this jumble of glinting

ice.

STILL CLOSER: We track down through valleys, skirt

crevasses, climb peaks and finally pause on a flat

stretch of ice. HOLD on this scene of timeless, savage

beauty, then...

THUD!!!

A FACE, hooded and goggled in ECW (extreme cold weather

gear) drops into frame, smashing down on the icy surface

with such brutal impact, the shattered goggle shield pops

out --

-- EYES STARE BLANKLY into camera -- locked in death.

It's a man.

Camera slowly starts to PULL BACK to see his limbs have

snapped at unnatural angles, the head grotesquely twisted

-- bright red arterial blood seeps from the corpse and

spreads out down tiny cracks in the ice until, with

startling speed, it turns dark and freezes.

We PULL BACK further and look down on the body, a bizarre

shape in a spider's web of frozen blood. And SLOWLY WE

PULL BACK... further and further...until all is dazzling

white.

TITLE: WHITEOUT

CONTINUED:

The sounds of lapping surf and distant seagulls serenades

us like a rhythmic lullaby.

-- CU on WOMAN'S TOES digging up soft, white sand.    The

shadow of a palm tree cascading over top.

Widen slightly -- a pair of feminine hands, donning an

ANTIQUE SILVER ring on the left middle finger, are slowly

applying coconut tanning lotion onto firm, athletic

calves. Deep. Soothing. Then --

O.C. KNOCK KNOCK on a door.

The hands stop.

Another KNOCK KNOCK.

The lapping surf and seagull sounds come to an abrupt

halt.

Widen to meet CARRIE STETKO, late 20's. Cargo pants --

rolled up, and an exercise top. She's kicking back, but

she's not at the beach.

In fact, she's in an office, sitting on a chair. A NEWLY

OPEN BAG OF KITTY LITTER sits next to a plastic tub she's

got her feet in. Two FLOOR LAMPS stand like sentinels

above her, blasting her with warm wattage. A fake palm

tree casts the shadow across her body. She's pulled the

earplugs out of her iPod -- back to the real world.

The door opens. Leaning into the room is JAMIE CLARK

(20's), African-American. She's dressed in a flannel

shirt, jeans. Carrie doesn't look entirely happy at the

intrusion.

Jamie leaves.

As Carrie gets to her feet, camera moves away from her,

panning around the small office. Half-packed up boxes

lay strewn about the floor.

CONTINUED: (2)

A CALENDER hangs crookedly before a desk. Each day has

been marked off with a large X. THREE DAYS REMAIN

unmarked. Last space reads: WINTER-OVER, and in the

space next to it, there's a cut out picture of a tropical

beach.

A dart board is next to it with A PHOTOGRAPH pulverized

with dart holes over the Bullseye. It's of a candy-

striped pole topped with a silver ball, surrounded by

international flags - the South Pole. Carrie is standing

next to the pole, smiling at the camera, arm-in-arm with

SAM MURPHY (30's). Looks like he's handsome, but his

face is a little more obliterated than the rest of him.

EXT.   MCMURDO STATION - ANTARCTICA - DAY

An ugly sprawl of prefab buildings, power-lines and above

ground sewage pipes. It looks more like a Siberian work

camp than Antarctica's largest research base and

logistics hub. In the background, smoke rises from Mt.

Erebus.

SUPER:    MCMURDO STATION (USA)

An icy wind HOWLS, but the base swarms with PARKA-CLAD

FIGURES shuttling supplies and packing up equipment for

winter.

We PICK UP CARRIE AND FOLLOW her as she strides down the

icy, unmade street. Her hood is pulled up and she's not

enjoying the cold. She reaches a row of buildings and

checks the names - GEOLOGY LAB #2...ASTROPHYSICS -

BERKLEY...until she reaches BIOLOGY BUILDING #7 and

pushes through the double doors into...

INT.   BIOLOGY BUILDING #7 - DAY

LONG BENCHES are covered with ANTARCTIC FLORA - MOSSES,

LICHENS and LIVERWORTS. They are being nurtured and

studied by SCIENTISTS who look like homeless people -

unkempt beards, bloodshot eyes and sun-damaged skin.

Carrie throws back her hood and unzips her jacket.

Approaches one of the scientists with familiarity, who is

in the process of EXTRACTING an ICE-CORE SAMPLE from a

stainless steel cylinder.

CONTINUED:

He indicates with a nod to a bench covered with tall

grass samples across the room. PROFESSOR SAPPERSTEIN,

young, thin and bearded, is studying them.

She crosses to him --

He looks at her --

His face tenses -- this is serious.

He leads her to a bench in the corner on which stands a

GLASS HERBARIUM containing only STALKS and a few HEAT

LAMPS. One of the GLASS PANELS has been smashed.

She looks at him --

CONTINUED: (2)

He sends an evil glare across the room to four glassy-

eyed scientists sitting around a desk, munching on potato

chips, candy bars, and drinking beer. Stifling laughter.

Carrie looks back to him -- can barely stifle a laugh.

She pulls out a small LEATHER FOLD chained around her

neck. Opens it up. Puts it in front of his face.

He's not sure what she's getting at --

She closes the fold, lets it drop around her neck.

He actually ponders the question for a moment. Carrie

puts an arm around his bony shoulder and steers him away

from the others.

CONTINUED: (3)

She pats him on the back.

INT.   MARSHAL'S OFFICE - MCMURDO - DAY

Carrie enters. Walks by a mirror. Takes a glance. Is

about to fix her hair, then stares at the reflection --

what's the point? We notice a slight scar on her right

temple.

She steps around the moving boxes to her desk, which is

bare except for a thick BINDER labelled,`DAILY REPORTS'.

She takes a seat, opens a binder and flips past dozens of

empty pages reading "INCIDENT: None. ACTION TAKEN:

None." On today's page she fills in the blanks with

"Theft of botany sample." And "None."

A pencil falls down onto the desk before her. Bounces.

Then rolls off. She doesn't even flinch, or look up.

Just stares unhappily at the binder.

Camera tilts up -- several pencils are stuck into the

cardboard tiles.

She closes the binder and puts it on the shelf beside a

row of framed photos: Carrie in a Marshal's uniform

graduation day; crisp, clean uniform. She and two other

girlfriends, all smiles, at a bar -- she's got a birthday

cake in front of her. Carrie on a beach somewhere,

sitting in a chair, feet in the sand -- shaded by a palm.

CONTINUED:

As she lifts the frames and moves to pack them in a

nearby box --

She turns to see SAM MURPHY, base commander, the guy on

the DART BOARD. There's an awkward beat.

He sees the photo on the dart board -- saunters over to

it.

This throws her.

He takes a closer look at the photo -- almost seems

amused.

He looks at her with a smile --

CONTINUED: (2)

EXT. AMUNDSEN-SCOTT STATION (ASB) - DAY - ESTABLISHING

The red and white striped ceremonial south "pole" stands

surrounded by international flags.

SUPER TITLE: South Pole / Amundsen-Scott Station (USA)

P

Ice as far as the eye can see. In the background is the

base. It's much smaller than McMurdo - a few dozen

specialist buildings surrounding four circular buildings

raised on hydraulic stands, interconnected by tubular

shaped walkways.

Off in the distance -- A SNOWCAT mounted with a plow,

pushes small drifts of snow off the runway onto a LARGE

BERM. It's been busy -- SEVERAL OTHER BERMS flank both

sides of the runway.

Camera pans to Carrie with a gear bag in tow, as she

deplanes a LC-130. A HALF-DOMED HANGAR rises up on the

other side of the plane.

The main ASB complex is before her.

Across the top of the entrance is a huge poster: 3 DAYS

TO WINTER-OVER EVAC. Piles of packed equipment are

everywhere.

Half a dozen NAKED MEN wearing only boots and face masks

blow out the front door screaming and yelling, run around

the South Pole, right past her, and back into ASB.

Carrie heads in --

INT.   ASB - CORRIDOR - DAY

Music cranks. Carrie knows her way. People come and go

as she strides along a corridor decorated with PARTY

BALLOONS and signs that read: `DON'T FORGET THE EVE OF

EVAC PARTY' -- comes to an office door with a small

plaque on it that reads: MARSHAL. Pushes it open.

INT. MARSHAL'S OFFICE - ASB - CONTINUOUS

Carrie enters. It's smaller than her McMurdo office with

a HOLDING ROOM that has a viewing window in the door. A

fine layer of dust blankets a little desk with a computer

and lamp on top.

A map of Antarctica is spread across a wall with sub-

station positions marked in block letters. A window

gives view to the South Pole.

INT. SMALL ROOM - RIGHT AFTER

Carrie opens the door. Single bed. Tiny dresser. No

frills. She tosses her gear bag onto the bed. Closes

the door.

INT. MEDICAL CLINIC - ASB - DAY

Carrie pokes her head in. An examination table, cabinets

with drugs and first aid equipment. A couple of hospital

beds. Moving boxes are packed up.

Another door in the back of the room is open, but the

light is off. Carrie turns to leave and --

INT.   MAIN CORRIDOR - ASB - CONTINUOUS

-- almost bumps right into one of the runners from

outside, Aussie RUSSELL KELLER (late 20's) coming down

the corridor. He's naked, except for a towel wrapped

around his waste. Sports a goatee. Couple tats.

Flashes a cocky smile.

CONTINUED:

She leaves.    He falls into stride with her.

Keller half smiles.

CONTINUED: (2)

They come to the end of the hall.   Keller stops.   Carrie

goes right.

INT. OPERATIONS CENTER - ASB

A large room by base standards. Several windows. A

giant map of ANTARCTICA dominates one wall with the

International stations and research outposts flagged with

pins that have their countries flags on them.   A grid of

EVAC TIMES of each STATION and OUTPOST is next to it. A

Tech is changing a few.

Another TECH sits as a console, lined with comm equipment

and computers. Others hustle about.

Talking into a headset is the Station Manager, RHONDA

STEWART (30's). Silky white skin. Irish. Long red hair

tied back. Perfunctory.

The Tech at the console turns to her --

Rhonda sees Carrie coming in the doorway. There's a

flash of awkward tension that both mask with professional

demeanor.

CONTINUED:

A moment of silence lingers as neither have anything else

to say.

Carrie leaves.

EXT. BACK OF ASB - DAY

Selecting a putter from a bag of golf clubs is DOC FURY,

60. Looks seasoned. Bearded. Wears the only non-red

parka we've seen: it's royal blue, trimmed with black fur

and emblazoned with dozens of emblems and patches from

years of Antarctic service.

Camera pulls back to REVEAL five NEWBIES (first-timers);

an Asian, French, Brazilian, Danish and an American. All

are standing on their jackets, shivering uncontrollably

in the wind.

Doc lines up on a hot pink golf ball and putts.

The ball rolls across the glacier in an impossible, wind-

driven arc, approaches a flag, and sinks.

The Asian holds a stopwatch.    He stares at it stupidly.

CONTINUED:

The class struggles into their jackets. Doc assists

those who, in their diminished capacity, are having

trouble figuring out how to put them on.

Carrie walks up.    Doc's eyes brighten.

Through a disjointed, chattering chorus --

CONTINUED: (2)

Carrie pulls a Driver from Doc's golf bag.    Lines up

another pink ball.

Carrie swings -- WHACK!   The ball shatters and pink bits

rain down around them.

INT. ASB - HANGAR - DAY

Carrie and Doc cross the interior, which houses Three

double prop Twin Otters, two Snowcats, and six

snowmobiles. Keller and two other employees are busy

working on one of the Otters.

They continue, after a beat --

He takes a beat --

Beat.

CONTINUED:

They arrive at one of the Otters.

BYRON DELFY, a baby-faced, African American pilot leans

out the plane's door.

Delfy smiles graciously.

Delfy disappears back into the plane.    Doc looks to

Carrie.

CONTINUED: (2)

She ushers him in.

INT. TWIN OTTER - AIRBORNE - SAME

The plane soars through a cloudless sky, the sun

sparkling brilliantly on the endless ice sheet below.

Carrie's in the copilot's seat, wrapped up tight in her

ECW, just trying to stay warm. Delfy's at the controls.

Doc's in the back.

Carrie notices a picture of a young boy, around seven,

wearing a Yankees cap dangling from the instrument panel.

It's framed in popsicle sticks with I LOVE YOU DADDY

written around the perimeter.

He lights up.

He looks at Carrie, all bundled up.

CONTINUED:

Carrie's eyes drift out the window --

Delfy tips the nose of the plane down. The ice below is

broken by jagged hills and yawning crevasses.

He spirals down among the icy hills, visibility is poor.

Heavy turbulence suddenly jars the plane sideways --

Delfy laughs at Doc's nervous reaction.

He banks the plane and slips down into a valley.

Down below is the body sprawled on the icy ground next to

the crevice.

EXT. ICE FIELD - LATER

The Twin Otter is in the distant background. Carrie, Doc

and Delfy, who has a gear bag slung over his shoulder,

weave their way around huge ice boulders -- skirt small

crevasses. Mid-conversation...

CONTINUED:

Delfy stops.    Grimaces.    Drops the gear bag.

The CORPSE is just ahead -- a frozen display of death.

They all stare at it - the body in unnatural angles, the

spiderweb of frozen blood. Delfy looks nauseous.

Delfy slowly shakes his head, no.

Carrie moves up to it. Takes a look down the deep

crevice four feet away. Can't see the bottom. She walks

around to get a look at the face. Blanches slightly.

Doc takes a look.

CONTINUED: (2)

Carrie pulls out a DIGITAL CAMERA from a pocket.     Shoots

a couple of pics.

Doc takes a look up behind them. The ice steepens

sharply to a vast plateau, scattered with jagged boulders

of ice.

Carrie pauses with her camera, looks up -- doesn't seem

as convinced.

Doc looks around -- she's right.

Carrie glances to Delfy.

Doc reaches down and tries to move the body -- doesn't

budge -- frozen solid into the ice.

Carrie unzips the gear bag.      Digs out ice two axes.

LATER

A pile of chopped ice is off to the side of corpse.

Delfy, who looks very uneasy about all this, grabs the

feet as Carrie and Doc each grab an arm.

They all strain to lift the body from the frozen ground.

They keep pulling and -- SNAP! The arm Doc is holding

BREAKS OFF at the elbow. Lands on his ass.

Delfy turns away and pukes.

A SUBJECTIVE POV - THROUGH HIGH POWERED BINOCULARS

is peering down at them from the top of an ice cliff.

Widen to see A MAN wearing a white camouflage parka.

Lowers the binoculars. Goggles shield his eyes. He

moves on.

INT. MAIN CORRIDOR - ASB - DAY

LOUD MUSIC. A party is in progress. People are

mingling, some have drinks, others dance.

The VOLUME of the music dies, replaced by a repetitive

SQUEAKING NOISE emanating through the silence.

People stop what they're doing, and focus on where the

noise is coming from, which is --

CONTINUED:

-- Doc and Carrie ushering a pushcart with Weiss'

contorted, frozen body through the middle of the party.

His dismembered arm rests across his chest.

The festive mood evaporates quickly as all eyes stay

glued to the horrific state of Weiss' body.

Just as they pass OPERATIONS, Rhonda steps out with the

Brazilian and French Newbies at her side to see what's

going on. Her eyes immediately go to Weiss, then shift

to meet Carrie's. Before she can say anything --

Doc and Carrie keep moving. Everyone else just keeps

silent and watching. Squeaky wheel fades.

INT. MEDICAL CLINIC - ASB - DAY

THUMP! Carrie and Doc set Weiss' body onto the

examination table.

She moves over to a sink and gets a cup of steaming hot

water from a tap.

CONTINUED:

Carrie returns with the water.   Goes to pour it on the

zipper, but Doc gently puts his hand on hers, stopping

her.

They share a moment, Carrie understanding, but --

She slides her hand away from his -- starts pouring the

water on the zipper.

CU ON CARRIE'S HAND TUGGING ON THE ZIPPER

Little by little, it starts to move -- then finally,

ZIIIIIIIIIIP. The jacket opens up, barely -- like sliced

skin.

Doc watches as she tries to pry it open further, but

can't.

She takes one half, he the other, and begin to pull. The

jacket opens up, like bending metal -- slowly revealing a

frozen, but extremely bloodsoaked chest area surrounding

A DEEP PUNCTURE WOUND through the shirt.

Doc's face sags.    Carrie stares at the wound.

CARRIE'S MEMORY HIT: The well defined chest of a man

wearing a tight T-shirt. A BULLET HOLE dead center.

BACK TO SCENE

Doc looks at Carrie with deep concern -- he's tuned in.

CONTINUED:

Both take a moment looking at the body.

Doc looks to Carrie, gentle, like a dad would his

daughter.

He eyes her pleadingly.

INT. CORRIDOR - SOON AFTER

Carrie steps out into the hallway. Takes a moment,

leaning against the wall, this whole thing wearing on her

more than she's revealed. She tilts her head back. The

second it hits the wall --

THE SOUND OF A GUNSHOT RINGS OUT!

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT (CARRIE'S MEMORY HIT)

Carrie's beat to shit, soul weary. She's on her knees,

full of blood. A man is on the floor between two beds

before her. She holds her gun at her side. He's dead.

BACK TO SCENE

Carrie refocuses.   Pulls away from the wall.    Leaves the

memory behind.

INT.   CORRIDOR - ASB - LATER

Carrie has a NEXTEL phone/walkie to her ear, making her

way up the corridor. Moves past a couple of guys loading

a dolly with boxes from an adjacent room.

She hangs up. Approaches a closed door.      Name plate on

it reads Dinkle -- SUB-STATIONS MANAGER.

O.C. MOANING and GROANING -- great sex. Carrie rolls her

eyes. Knocks on the door. No one answers. Moaning

continues. She doesn't have time for this. Opens the

door to see --

-- a large TV playing a locker-room porno where a

quarterback with no pants is giving it to a cheerleader

with no top. Half a dozen guys, oblivious to Carrie

standing there, CHEER the action.

CONTINUED:

The CHEERING dies as everyone turns to see Carrie

standing behind them. Only fake PORNO MOANING remains.

Everyone gets up, thrilled for an excuse to leave.       One

of them nods to Carrie on the way out.

Carrie flips a nearby wall switch. Lights kick on.

Small room. English flag. There's a Beckham poster and

an 8x10 framed photo, turned backwards, hanging on one

wall. A large map of Antarctica on another.

A proud assortment of tea bags are uniformly lined up

along a shelf.

One guy remains. HOWARD DINKLE.        Thirties.   English.

Bearded. On the heavy side.

As he crosses to her, he flips the 8x10 framed photo back

around -- it's of THE QUEEN MOTHER.

INT. DINKLE'S OFFICE - SOON AFTER

A FILE FOLDER drops into frame onto a desktop, which is a

map of Antarctica, under glass. File reads: DELTA ONE

ONE.

Widen.   Carrie opens it.

Three photos are stapled inside. One is of Weiss, the

other two have names written under them -- RUBIN and

MOONEY. Mooney is a runty looking guy with a mop of

blond hair. Rubin is a skinny, thin faced young guy with

a beard that hasn't filled in yet.

CONTINUED:

Dinkle points to a location on the map.       Delta One One is

labeled. Boasts an American Flag.

She looks at Dinkle.

He refers to a RADIO LOG SHEET hanging off the corner of

his desk. Gets uneasy -- can't find what he's looking

for.

Finally --

He hates to say it, but --

CONTINUED: (2)

She moves over to a LONG RANGE RADIO CONSOLE tucked up

against a wall.

Carrie spins a dial to 17.    Keys the microphone, drawing

it to her face.

Static crackles.

The dull constant static never wavers.

She puts down the mic.   Thinks for a moment.

Suddenly, Carrie's NEXTEL RINGS -- takes it off her belt.

CONTINUED: (3)

She's thrown.

Carrie's eyes shift to his picture on the desk.

CLICK.

INT. CORRIDOR - RIGHT AFTER

Carrie is moving at a quick pace. Passes the open door

to the clinic. Sees Doc looking through some boxes, a

glass of Scotch in hand. She stops. Backs up.

He looks over to her.    Raises his glass in a somber

toast.

CONTINUED:

He raises a curious brow --

INT. OPERATIONS CENTER - DAY

Carrie walks in. Rhonda has a phone to one ear, another

in her hand. Looks stressed. She's hovering over one of

the Techs who is sitting before a computer screen

displaying Satellite Weather Imagery -- think Doppler.

His focus is on a VAST STORM SYSTEM that is heading

toward ASB, which is marked in RED NEON. Other stations

are marked as well.

Rhonda raises her finger -- putting her on hold.      Carrie

doesn't like it.

She looks to Carrie --

CONTINUED:

Carrie spins.    Leaves.

EXT. VOSTOK - DAY - ESTABLISHING

Squat Soviet-ugly buildings, some collapsing, others with

boarded up windows, are barely visible through the

driving ice.

STORM LINES of different colors interconnect all the

buildings.

Carrie and Delfy, wearing full ECW gear, lean hard into

the wind, making their way towards the compound. She's

carrying a duffle bag. Can barely see the Twin Otter

behind them.

SUPER: Vostok Station (Russian Federation)

Population: 46                Temperature: -73

INT. VOSTOK - HALLWAY - DAY

Carrie leads the way up a decrepit, dimly-lit hall strung

with exposed pipes and wiring.

Gaunt, malnourished faces look up from the rooms they

pass. All stare. Silently. Looks more like death row.

INT. VOSTOK - OPERATIONS ROOM - DAY

Carrie enters a grungy operations room that never made it

out of the 70's: ancient computers and steel-cased radios

fill one wall.

One man welds equipment off to the side. Four more

Russians sit at a table playing cards and drinking Vodka.

They all take their time looking her over.

YURI, a big bear of a man in his forties, gets up from

the table. Huge arms. Scruffy face. Bloodshot eyes.

Yuri smiles.

Carrie hoists her duffel bag on the table and unzips it.

Yuri pulls it open. It's packed with steaks. The

Russians react with smiles and the mood lightens. Yuri's

grin widens further. Takes out a porno -- there's a

Cheerleader on the cover.

The Russians laugh.

CONTINUED:

INT. VOSTOK - COAT ROOM - DAY

Carrie is suiting up in her ECW gear, rope harness and

crampons. Her jacket's open. Delfy has a steaming cup

of coffee in his hand. He looks to her gear belt; cuffs,

pepper spray, baton...

She zips up her jacket.    He glances to a temp readout by

the door.

He takes a sip from his hot coffee.

He sees that one of her leg straps on her harness needs

to be fastened.

Sets down his coffee on a nearby shelf. As he fastens

it, Carrie pulls on her goggles and a face mask. They

finish at the same time.

CONTINUED:

Delfy leaves as Carrie cranks the submarine-type wheel-

lock in the center of the door.

WHAM! The door is suddenly yanked from her grasp,

slamming open against the building. Wind knocks her

back.

The storm sings in an even DULL ROAR. A solid white wall

of wind-driven ice blows past. The light is oddly dim.

CRACK! The coffee mug Delfy left on the shelf, breaks in

half, exposing a cylinder of frozen coffee. It rolls

across the shelf, falls, and shatters on the floor.

Carrie struggles back to the door and clips a three-foot

tether from her harnesses to a RED STORM LINE attached to

the side of the building.

She steps into the storm.

EXT. WHITEOUT - THE LINE - CONTINUOUS

Carrie leans into the door, pushing it closed and locking

the wheel.

Two steps into the storm, the building behind her is

gone. Step after step, there's nothing but the guide

line and the ROAR of the storm.

A gust of wind lifts her off the ground.     She's caught by

her tether and smacked down on the ice.

Slowly regaining her stance, she pushes onward. Finally

Carrie runs into something. It takes her a moment to

realize she's at a building.

She grabs the wheel-lock and turns, breaking ice, opening

the door.

INT. OUTLYING BUILDING - READY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Unclipping from the line, she closes the door on the

HOWLING behind her. Pulls off her mask. Teeth are

chattering.

She spins the wheel-lock of the door going out of the

ready room into the building.

INT. OUTLYING BUILDING - HALLWAY - RIGHT AFTER

Carrie hits the lights: nothing. No power. Just a

sliver of light stabbing in through a window.

Only silence responds.

The hallway is long and dark, leading away from her in

both directions. She draws a flashlight from her pocket.

Thumbs the switch, sending a beam out through the dark.

Something doesn't feel right. Slides her baton out from

her belt. She decides to go left.

Walking the hall, she tries door after door.   Finally one

gives.

She cautiously pushes it open: four stripped bunks in an

empty room.

Moves on down the corridor -- hears COUGHING, like

someone trying to clear their throat.

Looks ahead, and determines it's coming from behind a

closed door at the end of the hall.

It's confirmed when she hears it again.

Stops at the door.

She slowly opens it --

Now she can hear HEAVY, LABORED BREATHING --

CONTINUED:

-- Sweeps the inside with her light. It's a large lounge

type room: scattered chairs, tables, and an overturned

sofa on the other side -- where the heavy breathing's

coming from. Another cough.

She enters the room.

INSIDE THE LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS

Inching forward, she gets to the sofa. Looks over it to

see A BODY -- it's Mooney, lying in a pool of blood.

Struggling to breathe through a puncture wound to his

esophagus.

She goes to him. As she kneels, he grabs her, GASPING

for air, trying to tell her something.

Carrie catches a REFLECTION OF MOMENT behind her in his

eyes -- someone's coming at her.

-- She instinctively rolls back over Mooney just as --

WHAM! An ICE AXE swings down at her. Just misses her

head by an inch, but the shaft nails her arm holding the

baton that goes clattering across the floor.

The killer, wearing ECW gear with hood and goggles, takes

another swing. She lunges to the side. Axe misses her,

but sinks into Mooney. Game over for him.

Carrie slices the floor with her light, looking for the

baton, but can't see it.

The killer yanks his axe free of Mooney as Carrie bolts

around the sofa, heading back out the door.

INT. OUTLYING BUILDING - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Carrie blows back into the hallway at a full tilt run,

retracing her steps. Her light zigzags. The killer

emerges a few beats later on a run. It's going to be

close.

Halfway down the hall, she hangs a hard right toward the

Ready Room. Throws a glance over her shoulder -- he's

right behind.

She targets the ready room door -- the orb of her light

getting smaller and smaller as she nears.

CONTINUED:

Gets there.   Doesn't even want to look back -- it's all

or nothing.   She pulls open the door --

INT. OUTLYING BUILDING - READY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

-- Leaping in, she spins the wheel-lock closed.

SMACK!   The killer HITS THE DOOR from the other side.

She SPINS OPEN the outside door wheel-lock, as the lock

on the INNER DOOR behind her starts SPINNING OPEN at the

same time. It's a race.

CARRIE'S door slams open first and the wind hits her

hard.

She pulls on her mask and goggles just as the door behind

her bursts open.

EXT. WHITEOUT - CONTINUOUS

Carrie jumps into the whiteout, catching the red storm

line and clipping in as she staggers forward. Glancing

back, she sees the killer in the doorway, then loses

sight of him as she's swallowed in the whiteout.

She struggles down the line, buffeted by the storm, but

HER HAND ON THE LINE moves erratically -- He's on.

She swivels a nervous whirl to see -- the Killer

materializing out of the whiteout right behind her.    He's

clipped into Carrie's line. He raises the axe.

He swings. She jumps back, losing her footing. Hits the

ice hard -- face first. The killer towers over her,

raising the axe again. Carrie drives her heel into his

knee, knocking him off balance. He drops next to her.

He reaches for Carrie, grabbing her mask, pulling it off.

She cries out as the FREEZING WIND catches her face.

The killer gets to his feet and delivers a rib-cracking

kick, flipping Carrie onto her back.

SOUND FADES from Carrie's world.

There is nothing but her strained BREATHING.   The killer

draws back the axe, shiny with frozen blood.   He swings.

Carrie UNCLIPS her harness from the tether. THE WIND

grabs her, and Carrie SLIDES AWAY -- the killer

disappearing from view behind the swirling wall of white.

CONTINUED:

Sliding across the ice, Carrie SLAMS into a pole.   Grabs

on.

EXT. WHITEOUT - POLE - CONTINUOUS

Cinching her hood down, she searches the storm with no

idea which way to go.

Carrie glances up the post. Barely visible through the

blowing ice are signs pointing different directions:

"Moscow 17,030 Tokyo 13,329 Fiji 7,877 Los Angeles

15,641"

She pulls herself up and heads out, leaning into the

wind. Carrie staggers blindly, trying to protect her

face. Falling, she gets up, and struggles on.

Her drunken gait increases as she continues to lose heat.

A rope catches her in the neck. It's another storm line.

EXT. WHITEOUT - SECOND LINE - CONTINUOUS

Carrie lurches forward, holding the line with one arm.

Finally, she bumps into something. It moves. It turns

to face her. IT'S THE KILLER AGAIN. He swings. She

deflects the blow with her free arm, and manages to grab

the axe head. The killer tears the axe free, taking

Carrie's glove with it.

He swings again, but Carrie pulls hard on the rope,

throwing him off balance.

The axe cuts through the line. The killer hits the

ground, and is immediately ushered away in the wind, as

Carrie, clinging to the rope, slides over the ice like a

pendulum.

The line goes tight; she's jerked to a stop. It takes

everything she's got to get to her feet. She slowly

struggles up the line.

EXT/INT. STORAGE SHED - CONTINUOUS

More dead than alive, Carrie stumbles against the door

and grabs the wheel-lock with both hands.

Unable to bend the frozen fingers of her left hand around

the wheel, she struggles to turn it. Finally it gives.

CONTINUED:

The door swings wide and she stumbles in. But she's

caught; her bare hand frozen to the metal.

Ripping it free, her SCREAM is lost to the wind.

Carrie falls, collapsing against the door.       Blackout

INT. MOTEL 6 - BATHROOM - NIGHT (CARRIE'S MEMORY HIT)

A single bulb above casts a cone of light down onto

Carrie, who's leaning against a sink, staring at herself

in a mirror. She looks stressed. Her Marshal's badge

dangles around her neck.   Wears a shoulder harness. The

bathroom door behind her is open.

She catches a REFLECTION of a shadow moving across the

room behind her. Body tenses.

As she turns --

No answer.

She withdraws a 9mm from her harness -- eases toward the

door.

Gun ready, she rolls her back around the jam -- WHAM!

Carrie's blindsided by a fist that drives her into the

other door jam.

Before she can recover -- a guy, dark eyes, unshaven,

grabs her by the hair and runs her head first into the

bathroom mirror. SMASH. It's brutal. Shards fall into

the sink, as Carrie's RIGHT TEMPLE goes bloody. She

drops to the floor --

CARRIE'S POV - A BLURRY FIGURE stands over top of her.

She's still got some fight in her -- hands lash out in a

frenzy, like a cat in water.

The figure materializes around her.     It's Delfy, holding

her down.

CONTINUED:

Carrie slowly settles, then she's out again.

INT. OPERATIONS ROOM - VOSTOK - LATER

She's lying on a table, wrapped in blankets. An old,

WRINKLED FACED RUSSIAN MAN slowly lowers her wounded hand

-- pale white and missing some skin, back into a tray of

water next to her. Her silver ring glistens under the

florescent lights. A HUGE BRUISE runs across her arm.

Carrie's eyes drift to the old man next to her.

He flashes a smile of crooked, yellow teeth.

As she starts to sit up, he protests, saying something in

Russian. She ignores him. He walks away, mumbling

something else.

She sits up. Lifts her hand out of the water -- fingers

are slow moving.

INT. OUTLYING BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY

Delfy and Carrie, with her hand bandaged, both slice the

dark with flashlights. She's starting to get her

bearings back.

They walk a few silent beats, then --

It's a moment before she responds --

He lets it go.

THEY ENTER THE LOUNGE

Same as before. Carrie goes to the over-turned sofa.

Moves her light around -- searching. Passes over the

blood on the floor.

Carrie gets on her knees -- looks under the sofa.

Low angles her light. Something reflects.    Reaches in.

Retrieves her baton --

INT. OUTLYING BUILDING - HALLWAY - RIGHT AFTER

Just as Carrie and Delfy leave the lounge, her perifocal

vision picks up a wisp of light from a flashlight, which

bled out from a door's threshold halfway down the hall.

Delfy's eyes go wide -- Carrie's finger goes to her mouth

- Shhhhh.

She instinctively pulls her baton with her left hand, but

it hurts. She shifts it to the other.

She turns off her light.    Delphy does the same.   Motions

for him to stay put.

CONTINUED:

She heads to the source, keeping her baton ready and her

back tight to the wall.

Gets to the edge of the door.      It's open just slightly --

looks in.

Sees a man in an ECW jacket with his back to her, holding

a flashlight in one hand and digging through a duffle bag

with his other. Items are strewn. Another bag has been

completely turned inside out.

She enters.    Baton cocked.

His body tenses.

He slowly raises them.

He does. He's a guy in his 30's. Although he's clean

shaven, there's a rugged edge about him.

Delfy comes up behind her.

As he reaches into his liner --

This throws her.

CONTINUED: (2)

He holds out his ID for her.       As she reads --

Carrie lowers her baton.    He stands.

She starts to walk away -- he follows, he's not done at

all. Delfy brings up the rear.

She stops.

CONTINUED: (3)

This stops her -- digging?

She knows and her patience is running thin.

She continues with Pryce next to her.

INT. VOSTOK - CORRIDOR - DAY

Carrie and Delfy are heading toward the Ready Room. She

has her phone to her ear. Two Russians trail behind with

Mooney in a bodybag.

CONTINUED:

She thinks about it --

She clicks off.

Carrie opens the door to the ready room to find Pryce

standing there with a gear bag -- typing into a PDA (Treo

type).

He finishes entering his text into the PDA.       Sends.   Puts

it away.

EXT. OTTER - DAY

Delphy flies the plane over a labyrinth of deep, blue

crevices.

EXT.   CAMP DELTA ONE ONE - DAY

Delfy's Twin Otter has landed beside the camp. There are

TWO BIG TENTS and some scattered equipment - a SNOWCAT, a

CHEST of TOOLS, DRUMS of GASOLINE.

The sky is dark with clouds and the wind MOANS.      A haze

of wind-driven snow whips by.

CONTINUED:

Carrie, Pryce and Delfy climb out from the plane and make

their way toward the tents. Place looks deserted.

Pryce glances to a watch strapped to the outside of his

jacket.

She moves toward tent one, Pryce the other.

EXT. FIRST TENT - DELTA ONE ONE - CONTINUOUS

Carrie peers in. It's too dark to see anything. She

goes to pull out her flashlight with her left hand --

stops herself. Reaches in with her right, extracts it

from her pocket. Turns it on.

INT.   FIRST WORK TENT - DELTA ONE ONE - CONTINUOUS

Her FLASHLIGHT BEAM plays over a litter of personal

effects, then picks up a TRAIL OF BLOOD leading to a cot

between two others. Someone is huddled in a yellow

sleeping bag on it. Her body tightens.

She steps into the tent. Moves to the cot. There's a

pool of blood underneath. Her heart pounds. She uses

her flashlight, touches the sleeping bag. It doesn't

move. She pulls at it...

...and discovers A PAIR OF ECW PANTS -- the LEFT LEG is

soaked in blood.   No corpse.

She steadies her breathing.      She pulls out a small baggie

from her pocket.

CONTINUED:

Uses the end of the flashlight to chip away a frozen

blood sample from the pant leg. Puts it in the baggie.

Takes out her camera next.       Starts snapping.   Flash goes

off.

INT.   SECOND WORK TENT - DELTA ONE ONE - RIGHT AFTER

Carrie enters with Delfy. Place is lit by a single dim

bulb. This is a work space; two tables, instruments on

top. Sample containers piled everywhere. Numerous

photos of meteorites are stuck to a board.

She finds Pryce reading the crew's DAILY LOG.

Delfy's drawn to a BIZARRE LOOKING PIECE OF EQUIPMENT;

it's a red box on wheels with a handle like a lawn mower.

A circular antennae sprouts from the front of the box.

Carrie moves over to a table with a MAP SPREAD OUT ON

TOP. The ice field is marked off into sections.

He's flipping back and forth through the pages --

CONTINUED:

Carrie finds them on the map.

Carrie finds it.

They look at each other. Carrie finds it on the map as

Pryce moves up next to her.

INT. TWIN OTTER - SIDE CARGO DOOR - DAY

Carrie has Mooney's bodybag unzipped and is examining his

left leg. No cuts. No blood. She thinks on this non-

discovery for a moment, then zips it back up.

INT.   SNOWCAT - DAY - RIGHT AFTER

The CAT'S tracks CLANK and CRUNCH as it powers across the

featureless ice - the loneliest place on earth.

CONTINUED:

Pryce is in the backseat, Delfy is driving. Carrie is

next to him with the map and her GPS in hand. She stares

at a tiny blinking red light on the GPS --

EXT. HOTEL 6 - LOBBY - NIGHT (CARRIE'S MEMORY HIT)

FLASHING POLICE REDS reflect off the glass of the front

doors of a hotel. Several squad cars are nosed up to the

entrance.

Patrons and bystanders are perched in various locations,

watching as A HANDCUFFED Carrie is escorted outside by

two uniformed officers. Her eyes are full of tears.

She's put into the backseat of one of the cars. As the

door closes, she stares out the window where Coroners are

loading a body under a sheet into the back of their

truck.

BACK TO SCENE

INT. SNOWCAT - DAY

Delfy's looking at Carrie like he's waiting for an

answer.

She glances to the GPS.

Pryce sees Carrie pause for a moment, massaging her

gloved left hand.

He can see it aches more than she's letting on.

CONTINUED:

She pauses, humored.

She takes a moment, gazing out the window to the endless

landscape of white.

CONTINUED: (2)

A faint beeping noise emanates from her GPS.

All eyes go ahead as they drive on.   Looking.   Nothing

but an icy plateau.

After a couple of beats --

Delfy pulls to a stop.   They exit the cat.

EXT. ICE FIELD - DAY

All three get cold-cocked by an invisible wind.      Carrie

steps away from the Cat. Pryce does too.

Her eyes scan the ice with cool appraisal.    It's

completely flat. Desert like.

Carrie ignores him. Walks further away from the cat.

Ice CRUNCHES UNDER HER FEET as she keeps looking -- then,

she stops. Something's not right. Looks DOWN.

Kneels to the ice. Scoops some up. Checks it out.

Perplexed. Pryce approaches from behind.

CONTINUED:

She gets to her feet. Walks further -- her eyes now

paying close attention to the texture of the ice. After

a dozen steps, texture changes. Ice is now smooth --

like it's supposed to be.

She turns around.   Tries to get the bigger picture.

Looks at the ground all around her. Realizes a large

area has been blanketed with shaved pieces of ice a few

inches thick --

She heads back across the area.       Scans the horizon.

Takes another step forward.

WHOOSH! In an instant, Carrie's gone! DISAPPEARS below

the ice. Only a four foot wide hole remains, that was

covered up with a white, iced-over tarp.

Pryce and Delfy move toward her -- each hesitating

slightly, unsure of their own footing.

Pryce gets to the hole. Looks down. Carrie is

precariously dangling in an ICE SHAFT that slopes at a

slight angle. She's managed to grasp a protruding piece

of ice, but she's fighting the pain in her left hand to

hold on. It slips off. Below her -- nothing but

darkness.

Pryce lays flat. Reaches his hand down -- six inches too

short. Delfy appears from behind.

Delfy does.    Pryce inches closer.

CONTINUED: (2)

He gets closer.   Closer.    Moves to within an inch from

hers --

-- She SLIPS.    Falls away.   Things become silent.

Delfy peers over Pryce's shoulder into the abyss.

Delfy springs to his feet.

INT. ICE SHAFT - SAME

Darkness. A flashlight clicks on. Reflects off a wall

of ice with a frozen blood trail leading up. Carrie gets

to her feet. Sees that she's in a small dug out area.

As she slowly turns to get her bearings, her light falls

on an ESCAPE HATCH of some kind, maybe three feet high.

Carrie shines the light to her feet.        The ground beneath

her is metal.

INT. ICE SHAFT - RIGHT AFTER

Pryce, with a flashlight in hand, lowers himself down a

rope to the bottom of the shaft where Carrie waits.

Delfy follows. Both take in the discovery.

Carrie moves over to the hatch. Pulls on it. Opens

easily. She and Pryce hit the interior with their

lights. Find themselves staring into...AN AIRPLANE!

INT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS

Off their lights -- every surface scintillates with ice

crystals from the frozen atmosphere, undisturbed except

for recent tracks of footprints filing in and out -- they

go forward and aft, disappearing into darkness. Place is

tomb silent.

CONTINUED:

Twisted, and strewn with large containers scattered at

odd angles -- victims of an intense IMPACT. The plane is

pitched up at the nose, making their footing precarious.

Carrie shuffles her way forward into the darkness,

heading for the cockpit.

Something BRUSHES her leg. She spins. Shines her light -

- which illuminates a HAND, fingers in a clawed position -

- as if in excruciating pain. She whips her light past

the hand, up the arm -- captures the FACE of a man

staring at her! It takes a moment to realize -- he's

dead, pinned between two large metal crates.

Delfy stands still. Staring.           Carrie throws a look back

over her shoulder --

She continues on with Delfy staying close.         Her light

targets the cockpit door. It's closed.

INT. COCKPIT - RIGHT AFTER

Carrie pushes the door open.

The beam of her light reveals frozen blood SPLATTERED

across a SHATTERED WINDSHIELD -- chunks of ice protruding

through it.

Continues over three dead men in flight suits still

strapped into seats, their broken bodies and ghastly

expressions perfectly preserved. Each have a sidearm

holstered around their waist.

She looks back to Delfy -- gets confused.

INT. CARGO BAY - RIGHT AFTER

Trailing her beam of light, Carrie and Delfy climb

through a thick wall of nylon webbing. Enter a cluttered

cargo area.

Ransacked Antarctic gear is strewn everywhere in a tangle

of ropes and crampons, old ECW gear, and boxes of

supplies.

Dipping into a case of bottles, Delfy pulls one free,

sniffs, and drinks.

Delfy grins.

Carrie continues through the hold. Her FLASHLIGHT BEAM

flickers over more chaos of the crash. HUGE STEEL TANKS

TAKE UP MOST OF THE MID-SECTION.

Spots Pryce's flashlight holding on something just ahead.

Moves to it.

Her light hits Pryce, who is focused on a HEAVY STEEL

CAGE WELDED INTO THE AIRFRAME. Incredibly strong. And

inside it is a STEEL SAFE. Door is open.

Pryce takes a beat -- turns to she and Delfy.

Carrie moves in closer.   Sees that the cage has been

breached.

CONTINUED:

Part of it has been damaged by the crash and this

weakness has been ruthlessly attacked by the previous

intruders until they forced an opening. Discarded tools

litter the floor.

There's a pool of frozen blood near the opening -- where

one of the torn, jagged bars of the steel cage is covered

in blood --

She uses her light to examine the interior of the safe

more closely -- the frost on the shelves exposes SIX

ROUND RUST RINGS where containers have been removed.

Each one roughly measuring a foot tall, four inches wide.

The PLANE SUDDENLY TREMBLES.

The muffled ROAR of a diesel.

CRASH! -- the unmistakable sound of FALLING ICE.

CRASHCRASHCRASH!    More ICE.

They scramble back through the darkness, the flashlight

beams swinging wildly about the hold.

MORE ICE FALLS. It's getting louder as they're getting

closer to the source.

Carrie targets ahead with her light -- illuminates the

hatch as A LOAD OF ICE DROPS IN covering it completely.

Light fades.

The continual sound of falling ice grows MUFFLED and

DISTANT.

CONTINUED: (2)

Carrie and Pryce both pull out their phones.

Shakes his head no.

INT. PLANE - AT THE HATCH - LATER

CHIPCHIPCHIP!    Ice is flying.

Things are desperate as a single flashlight beam propped

up on a crate, illuminates Carrie, Delfy and Pryce hard

at it -- frantically chopping away at the ice filled

hatch with pieces of scrap metal from the plane. Efforts

are big-- but the progress minimal.

Delfy looks at him with the intensity of a trapped

animal.

The light from the flashlight slowly begins to fade.

Carrie goes over to the crate, slaps it against her leg,

trying to get more juice going. Still fading. Light

goes out --

-- Screen goes black. Can't see a thing. A second

later, ANOTHER LIGHT KICKS ON -- Pryce is holding it.

Hands it over to Carrie --

CONTINUED:

Carries mind whirls with her lack of options, then --

Pryce knows she's right.

Delfy looks to them both.    Desperate.

Pryce heads to the back, his body becoming barely visible

in the dissipating range of light.

Carrie takes a six-inch, pearl handled Buck knife from a

pocket, unfolds it-- starts cutting the liner of her

coat.

Delfy moves to a nearby wooden crate. Goes to lift it,

but it's frozen to the floor. Stomps on it. It breaks.

Pulls pieces from the siding for torch sticks.

Pryce comes back with a couple bottles.       Stops dead in

his tracks.

Carrie looks over to see him staring at two LIFE JACKETS

attached to the wall near the hatch. He's thinking.

He moves to Carrie --

He exchanges the bottles for her flashlight.

He shines the light to the ceiling as he heads toward the

back, leaving Carrie and Delfy getting swallowed in the

dark.

CONTINUED: (2)

Pryce goes back into the cargo area.

Carrie watches Pryce's flashlight moving about in the

cargo area of the aircraft.

Carrie and Delfy get to Pryce. They follow his beam

straight up to expose an ESCAPE HATCH in the roof of the

fuselage.

Pryce moves to a large crate -- starts to push it over.

They join, sliding it over below the hatch.

He jumps up onto it -- examines the hatch area.

Pryce hands Carrie the flashlight. She targets the hatch

area as he opens an electrical panel beside it; a

crisscrossing maze of wires.

CONTINUED: (3)

As he reaches up to examine the wiring, Carrie catches a

GLIMPSE of a SHOULDER HARNESS under his liner.

As he looks down, Carrie masks her discovery.   Hands over

her phone. He extracts the BATTERY.

Pryce is nervous himself as he places one selected wire

onto the battery, and prepares for another.

He looks to Carrie and Pryce who have backed up against

the fuselage.

Delfy nods.

Carrie is still running that shoulder holster through her

head.

Pryce touches the last wire to the battery.   Nothing

happens. Hope freezes.

Pryce tries again --

-- KA-BOOM! The hatch EXPLODES INWARD, ricocheting

around the inside of the cargo hold like a giant bullet

coming in and out of their light.

SLAM, SLAM, SLAM, until...WHAM, it buries itself edge-on,

halfway into the fuselage, missing Carrie by a hair's

width.

They stand there, deafened and stunned, then a shower of

ice rains into the plane where the hatch used to be and a

THIN SHAFT OF LIGHT DROPS into the cargo bay like a gift

from God.

Pryce drops down.   Moves to another crate.

CONTINUED: (4)

Delfy moves forward to help. The two of them push it

over. It's a strenuous lift to get it on top of the

other.

Just as they finish, Pryce turns to find himself facing

Carrie holding one of the RUSSIAN'S GUNS TO HIS FACE.

Pryce stares at her in disbelief.

She reaches into Pryce's liner, pulls out his sidearm

from the shoulder holster.

Switches it with the one in her hand.    Puts the Russian

gun in her coat pocket.

She takes out her handcuffs.

She holds out the cuffs.

CONTINUED: (5)

Delfy takes the cuffs from her.  Cuffs Pryce to some

exposed piping. Carrie lowers her gun.

She sees a moment of contemplation on Pryce's face --

Beat.

CONTINUED: (6)

Carrie wrestles with her emotions. She looks back

towards the open safe, the blood staining the airplane

floor. Makes a decision.

EXT. SURFACE - DAY

Delfy wriggles out from the hole. He reaches back.

Helps Carrie to the surface. Pryce follows.

They look around. The weather has deteriorated - the sky

is dark with fast moving clouds. The wind is HOWLING.

The Snowcat is parked over the hole, blade lowered.

Delfy runs over, jumps onto the CAT.   Looks inside the

cab.

Carrie notices a single set of an airplane's ski tracks

in the distance.

CONTINUED:

Delfy starts up the Cat.

Carrie pulls out her Nextel as Pryce takes out his PDA.

She depresses the walkie button -- makes her way to the

Cat.

Walkie crackles.

Carrie clicks off.

She massages her gloved hand. Looks to Pryce who's

talking on his PDA as he heads toward the Cat.

CONTINUED: (2)

He looks to Carrie --

As Pryce climbs into the cat --

INT. SNOWCAT - CONTINUOUS

And slides into the back --

He hangs up. Carrie climbs in -- looks back at the

plane's ski tracks.

Pryce and Delfy wait for the answer.

CONTINUED:

She closes the door to the Cat.

INT.   CORRIDOR - ASB - DAY

Carrie strides along the corridor with Pryce. They pass

a window where we see that an LC-13O EVAC PLANE is parked

out front -- it's tail section open like the mouth of a

massive beast. Move past several people, balloons and

`Eve of Evac' signs.

Pryce sees Carrie really cradling her left hand, now.

Dinkle's pulling a DUFFLE BAG toward them.      Sees Carrie

and Pryce about to head up some stairs.

Carrie stops.

She pulls Dinkle's two-way off his hip.       Hands it to

Pryce.

Carrie ignores him.

Dinkle shoots Pryce the stink eye as he walks away --

CONTINUED:

Pryce heads up as Carrie continues on down the main

corridor.

INT. OPERATION CENTER - ASB - DAY

Murphy and Rhonda are standing next to the COMMS TECH,

who is sitting in front of his COMPUTER. The screen

revealing the SATELLITE IMAGERY of the storm It's grown

and moving closer to ASB.

Murphy looks stressed.

Rhonda is thrown off by his tone --

Murphy looks over.       Sees Carrie coming in through the

door.

She doesn't like his tone --

CONTINUED:

THE SOUND OF A LARGE BOOK dropping onto the floor, sends

a harsh reverb across the room.

Everyone's attention goes to Doc standing at the door.

He's really pissed. Glares at Murphy.

CONTINUED: (2)

Murphy looks at Doc.   Not giving in.

Carrie calms down -- she's had enough.

Carrie looks to Rhonda --

Rhonda pulls it from her clipboard.     Hands it to her.

Carrie walks out with Doc.

INT. MAIN CORRIDOR - ASB - CONTINUOUS

A SUBJECTIVE POV - watching Carrie and Doc from behind

the crack of a door as they walk down the main corridor

and right by.

INT. MEDICAL CLINIC - ASB - LATER

Carrie's sitting on the edge of an examination table as

Doc slowly unwraps her bandaged hand. She winces from

the pain.

She looks at him warmly --

Doc smiles, continues to unravel the gauze-

CONTINUED:

The gauze finally comes off, revealing her middle TWO

FINGERS have turned COMPLETELY BLACK along with part of

the flesh of her palm. Her ring looks strangely out of

place.

Doc reaches over to a nearby drawer -- takes out a

sterilized syringe packet.

He opens up the packet.

Doc puts the tip of the needle onto her blackened flesh.

He pushes hard -- penetrates the skin. We see the worry

begin to elevate further on Carrie's face.

Doc tries the needle in another location.

CONTINUED: (2)

Slowly shakes her head.   He holds her gaze evenly.

Carrie is sickened.

INT. MEDICAL CLINIC - LATER

Carrie sits in sullen silence, the room dark around her.

The only light bounces in from a sterile, draped area

where Doc works on her hand. She can't watch as his

CURVED SUTURE and thread, rises and falls with every

stitch he makes. Carrie has her attention on BLOODY

GAUZE piled up in a tray --

CARRIE'S MEMORY HIT: AN IMAGE SHE SAW EARLIER: The well

defined chest of a man wearing a T-shirt. A BULLET HOLE

oozes dead center. This time we stay there a little

longer, watching the T-shirt absorb the blood around the

wound. As the stain widens, so does the camera...

slowly... bringing into picture THE MAN Carrie shot.

He's wearing a MARSHAL'S BADGE around his neck.

BACK TO SCENE

Carrie looks at him, sullen, afraid to look down.     Then

slowly lets her eyes drift to her hand.

CONTINUED:

He rises. Goes to a medicine cabinet. Selects a pill

bottle. Shakes it. Only a couple inside. He returns

with the pill bottle.

She stares at the vacant spot where her fingers used to

be.

INT. CARRIE'S BEDROOM - ASB - DAY

Carrie's bag is open on the bed with the Russian's gun

next to it.

She's trying to put on a clean flannel over a T-shirt,

but can't button it up with only one hand. Her

frustration mounts as she fights back every bit of

emotion that's trying to get out.

She finally gives up -- kicks over a nearby chair that

sweeps the stuff off her bed. Bag and gun go flying.

Carrie slumps to the floor.    Silent tears.

After a beat -- she notices Pryce standing in the doorway

with some PAPERS in his hand. He's looking at her

compassionately.

Carrie nods, pulling herself together, swallowing her

emotion.

He enters.    Holds out her ring for her.

He joins her.    Hands over her ring.     Takes a seat next to

her.

CONTINUED:

They sit in silence together for a moment. Carrie sees

the Russian pistol that's ended up on the floor close by.

Picks it up. Examines it like a relic.

Beat.

She looks at him --

CONTINUED: (2)

Beat.

Pryce takes it all in.   Not the story he expected.

Carrie shifts in her chair.   Leans forward.

She stands.   Pryce joins her.

CONTINUED: (3)

She notices the papers he's holding; faxed photos of

THREE DIFFERENT TYPES OF CANNISTERS WITH RUSSIAN WRITING

ON THEM.

He shows them to her.   One-by-one.

As Carrie studies them --

The RADIO on Pryce's hip -- crackles...

Pryce smirks.

He moves closer.   Starts to button her up.

INT. MARSHAL'S OFFICE - ASB - RIGHT AFTER

Carrie enters. Light streaming in through the window

hits her tired face. She reaches for the light switch on

the nearby wall --

-- A HAND GRABS HERS --

-- AGGRESSIVELY YANKS her away from the open door. It's

kicked closed as she's drawn backwards into a man's

embrace. A knife's brought to her neck.

Carrie nods -- slides her hand toward her pocket...

She stops.

He slowly turns her around to face him.

-- it's Rubin, but he looks beat to shit. Deep cracks

slice across his bloody, chapped lips. Peeling skin

flakes on his face. Desperate, despondent eyes. Shaky,

frostbitten fingers. He's having a hard time holding it

together as he can barely get the words out...

Carrie's confused.

His eyes well.

CONTINUED:

He nods - he knew.

His shaking hands slowly lowers it -- she breathes a

little easier. He sets it down on an empty book shelf

next to him.

He stares off blankly --

He tries. Looks at her through tired, pinched eyes --

he's trying.

O.C. KNOCK. KNOCK on her door.

Rubin is spooked.    Glares at her -- scared.   Like a caged

animal.

It falls on deaf ears -- he goes for the knife.    She

tries to stop him.

Rubin shoves her aside, throwing her against a chair.

She topples backwards.

He whips open the door, driving an unexpected shoulder

into Doc, who gets nailed so hard, he goes stumbling back

up against the wall behind him. Takes the wind right out

of him. Pills all over the floor.

CONTINUED: (2)

Rubin dashes off down the hallway -- it's an effort.

Carrie appears at the door. Catches a glimpse of Rubin

disappearing down a set of side stairs.

Doc nods.

She takes off after him, pulling her phone off her hip.

AT THE STAIRS

She takes two at a time -- keys the two-way...

BOTTOM OF STAIRS - LEVEL ONE

As Carrie comes off the stairs -- looks left -- there's

three guys carrying boxes out of a room. Snaps a look to

the right --

-- Rubin's at the far end, slipping through a doorway

that leads into an INTERCONNECTING TUNNEL to another part

of ASB.

Carrie kicks it into high --

EXT. ASB - OUTSIDE CONNECTING TUNNEL - SAME

A SUBJECTIVE POV - catches interval glimpses of Rubin

through the small windows that run along the side of the

tunnel as he dashes through.

INT. CONNECTING TUNNEL   - SAME

Rubin is moving through to a door at the far end as

Carrie enters. It's lined with several free standing,

empty bookcases.

INT. SCIENCE BUILDING - RIGHT AFTER

Carrie enters through the connecting tunnel's doorway.

Not a lot of light. Slows her pace. It's quiet.

Dormant. Vacant lab stations. Room's been shut down for

the winter. Eyes scan. Fall upon --

-- A DOOR ACROSS THE ROOM.   A sign above reads: READY

ROOM.

She takes off again, slaloming her way around the lab

stations to get to the door.

OTHER SIDE OF ROOM

Carrie gets to the door. Pulls on the handle. Won't

open. Rattles. Looks in through a viewing window --

sees --

-- a panicked Rubin inside, grabbing ECW gear off a rack

mounted to the wall.

A DIGITAL READOUT ABOVE THE EXIT DOOR READS: -60.

He and Carrie exchange glances.

He shakes his head.

She tugs harder on the doors. Stuck. Looks through the

window to see he's tied them together with some climbing

rope.

In that same instant a shaft of brilliant daylight floods

half the room as the outside door is whipped open.

A MAN in full ECW - stands in the doorway. He's wearing

a FACE MASK and GOGGLES. Holds an ICE AXE poised, ready

to strike -- it's the same guy who attacked her.

CONTINUED:

Rubin bolts back toward the door separating he and

Carrie, but --

-- SWOOOSH! THE ICE AXE is buried into his shoulder,

gaffing him like a fish. The pain's excruciating for

Rubin, who spins on his attacker like a wild man.

BULLDOZES into him, driving him back out the door.

Both TUMBLE down a steep set of stairs -- the exposed end

of the ice axe gets stuck in a step's steel meshing on

the way down -- rips out of Rubin's shoulder.

EXT. READY ROOM - BASE OF STAIRS - CONTINUOUS

Rubin eats the pain as he gets to his feet. Takes off.

Runs blindly with panting intensity verging on hysteria.

Disappears around the contour of ASB before the other guy

can get to his feet.

His assailant rises. Goes back up a couple steps to

retrieve his embedded ice axe, but finds it wedged so

tight, it won't budge. Abandons it.

INT. SCIENCE BUILDING - SAME

Carrie shoulders the door, but still doesn't budge.

Hears FOOTSTEPS BEHIND HER. Turns to see it's Pryce.

Pryce latches on to a heavy SUPPLY CART filled with

beakers, micro-scopes and other gear, that's tucked

against one of the lab stations.

Off his confused look --

Pryce picks up speed as he targets the door. Hits it

like a freight train, busting it open! Cart goes

crashing. Contents scatter like buckshot.

INT. READY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The two of them are hit with icy cold coming in through

the open exit door.

CONTINUED:

Carrie throws a look outside -- bottom of stairs are

vacant. Ice axe is still there.

Carrie immediately closes the outside door. Pryce goes

for the ECW wear. Scrambles to get a coat on. Carrie

joins. Same thing.

EXT. ASB - RIGHT AFTER

Rubin staggers as he follows a line of storage bins

tucked against the base of the main building. The blood

from his wound already frozen on his shirt.

The cold -- it's killing him. Body's shaking.    The sun's

reflection off the ice is blinding.

RUBIN'S POV -

-- His vision begins to cloud as the corneas are

literally being burned by the intense light. He tries to

shield them -- has little effect.

He looks over his shoulder -- gets a BLURRED IMAGE of his

attacker not far behind.

Rubin trips. Hands go to the icy ground to protect his

fall. Still hits hard. Starts to get up, but his palms

are frozen to the surface. Doesn't have time to care --

pulls hard, tearing the skin right off. Stands. Spins

around in a panicked whirl -- he's lost ground.

Continues to the end of the storage bins. Moves under

ASB, using the enormous HYDRAULIC LIFT COLUMNS to conceal

his movement.

EXT. UNDERNEATH ASB - CONTINUOUS

Up ahead -- forty yards away -- hope. He continues

toward some storage containers and the SNOW MELTER on the

other side, where TWO PEOPLE, CLAD IN ECW are finishing

filling an insulated container with water from an

insulated hose mounted to the Melter.   A snowmobile is

parked next to them.

He tries to scream, but only a dull, raspy, muffled voice

escapes...

The guys -- oblivious.

EXT. READY ROOM - STAIRS - DAY

Carrie and Pryce, now bundled up in ECW, exit the room

and head down the stairs. Split up -- go opposite

directions around the complex.

EXT. UNDERNEATH ASB - SAME

Rubin's pace is slowing -- he's exerting himself to get

to the people as they climb into snowmobile with the

container.   Frostbite is chewing up his lungs. He's too

slow, they take off. He coughs up blood.

He turns around to check on his pursuer.   Twenty feet

away and closing.

Rubin's eyes desperately search for some kind of weapon --

anything. Sees the insulated hose on the SNOW MELTER.

Heads for it.

EXT. ASB - OTHER SIDE - SAME

Carrie passes a gap between storage containers where

several snow shovels are stuck into a mound of snow --

through their vertical slats, SHE CATCHES A GLIMPSE OF

RUBIN at the Snow Melter across on the other side of the

main building. Sees the ECW guy closing in.

EXT. ASB - UNDERNEATH - SAME

Pryce is moving under ASB. Passes a hydraulic support

leg. Spots Carrie on the other side moving toward Rubin.

Also sees the ECW guy in pursuit. Heads toward them.

EXT. ASB - SNOW MELTER - SAME

Rubin's frostbitten hand reaches for the hose. Grabs it,

but he doesn't have the strength to turn it on. Throws a

defeated glance over his shoulder to see --

-- THE VILLAIN in ECW gear right on him! Shoves Rubin

against the tank. Grabs the hose from him. Turns it on -

- SPRAYING him head to toe.

Rubin's clothes turn to ice. One eye freezes shut. Lips

go cobalt blue. He tries to escape, but several stiff

steps away, he slows and finally stops: a prisoner in his

ice-locked clothing.

The man moves to Rubin.   Grabs his head, and - SNAP -

breaks his neck.

Rubin's body topples stiffly to the ground.

INT. OPERATIONS ROOM - ASB - SAME

Rhonda crosses the busy room. Reaches for a clipboard

hanging next to the window. Something outside catches

her attention.

She looks to Murphy, who is on the phone.

Murphy and the others join her at the window. They see

Rubin on the ground, but the Snow Melter blocks any view

of the killer.

EXT. ASB - SNOW MELTER - SAME

The Killer turns to leave the crime scene and --

-- WHACK! He's blindsided by a SHOVEL to his head.

Goggles shatter.

CONTINUED:

He drops.

Carrie pulls his parka hood away from his head -- snaps

the goggle from his face.

It's KELLER!

Blood trickles from the fresh wound to his head.

The shovel's courtesy of Carrie, who stands over top of

him. Holds the shovel to his neck like a guillotine

blade.

Pryce approaches. Glances to Rubin's frozen body -- neck

askew. Carrie is wound up. Keller's still recovering

from the impact --

They each take his jacket by the shoulder -- pull him

back over to the Snow Melter.

She hands the shovel to Pryce, who puts it to Keller's

neck.

Carrie pulls her Buck knife from her back pocket, then

whips off Keller's gloves. Tosses them aside. The cold

makes him more coherent. Sees Pryce at this throat.

Keller shifts his attention to Carrie, who's using her

knife to SLICE open his ECW jacket and pants, exposing

bare arms and legs.

CONTINUED: (2)

Keller instantly starts to shake.

Carrie grabs the hose from the Snow Melter.

She brutally stomps on Keller's exposed arm, douses him

with water from the hose, welding his arm to the ground

as it freezes instantly.

Keller begins to shiver violently.

Carrie releases more water, freezing more of the arm.        He

screams. Pain is too much. He caves.

Carrie's suddenly grabbed from behind.     It's Murphy.

Furious. Two other guys at his side.

She twists free of his grasp.      Gets in Keller's face.

CONTINUED: (3)

She glares at him.

She looks to the guys that came out with Murphy.

The two guys go to Keller, but his arm is stuck to the

ground. Carrie kicks it free. It's painful. Keller

screams.

The guys lift him to his feet.     Haul him away.

Murphy looks to Pryce --

Carrie looks at Pryce.

Pryce looks at Carrie.

Murphy looks to Carrie with an intense glare --

Pryce steps in --

CONTINUED: (4)

Murphy looks to Carrie, softens slightly --

He leaves.

INT. LC-130 - DAY

Carrie is near the cockpit, searching under a row of

seats. Pryce approaches. A handful of ASB employees

tear through every inch of the fuselage and cargo.

Carrie gets to her feet.    Pissed off.

Carrie's suddenly chilled with the ominous reality that --

Carrie races off the plane.    Pryce tries to keep pace.

INT. CORRIDOR - RIGHT AFTER

Carrie is slaloming her way through the corridor, which

is packed with ASB employees carrying their bags for the

evac. Pryce is close behind.

INT. ASB - MARSHAL'S OFFICE - RIGHT AFTER

Carrie enters. Pryce at her side. Her face goes white.

The door to the holding room is wide open. Keller's

GONE.

Then it hits her --

As the two of them take off for the door --

INT. ASB - HANGAR - DAY

Delfy walks across the floor. Hangar is minimally lit.

Still. Silent. Void of personnel. The Otters are lined

up. The Snowcats and snowmobiles on the other side. He

heads toward an Otter.

INT. TWIN OTTER - HANGAR - DAY

Delfy reaches in and gets his son's picture, which is

still hanging on the console. Then, something catches

his attention through the windshield of his plane. He

sees a FUEL HOSE running to another plane -- and it's

pumping.

Curious, he gets out of the Otter. Eyes dart about the

hangar. Doesn't see anyone. Heads to the other plane.

Discovers that a door is open on the other side. Takes a

another look around. Doesn't see anyone. Moves closer.

CONTINUED:

Gets to the plane.   Takes a look inside, and --

THUD!   He's nailed with a giant Crescent wrench to the

head.   Stumbles back.

Keller leaps out, grabbing hold of a staggering Delfy.

Ruthlessly runs him head first into a standing tool

chest. Delfy collapses to the ground in a heap.

Unconscious.

EXT. ASB - HEADING TOWARD THE HANGAR - RIGHT AFTER

Carrie and Pryce, dressed in ECW are making their way

toward the hangar.

INT. LC-130 - SAME

Employees are trudging up through the back entrance into

the plane. Get checked off a list by the LOAD MASTER.

Toss their gear into a netted cargo area. Find a seat.

Plane is nearly full.

INT. TWIN OTTER - HANGER

Keller has the engine going. It's loud. Preps the

console for flight, flipping switches -- suddenly sees

Carrie and Pryce enter the hangar. Guns drawn.

CARRIE AND PRYCE

Shift their attention to the plane.    Blades turning. They

stalk forward. Slowly. Carefully.      Eyeing for any

betrayal of movement.

Then, with a nod from Carrie, they move in. Fast.

Ready. Look into the plane. It's empty, except for a

duffle bag in the back. Carrie nods to Pryce. Motions

for him to go one way, she'll go another.

INTERCUT CARRIE AND PRYCE

Carrie eyeballs a Snowcat. It's door is slightly open.

She heads for it. Gun poised.

Pryce moves to check the next plane.    Eyes dart to every

dark corner.

Carrie gets to the Cat.    Springs toward the door.

Inside's empty.

CONTINUED:

Pryce walks under THE WING of the next plane. Spots

Delfy just ahead on the ground by the tool chest. Looks

like he's stirring into consciousness. Then --

SWOOSH!! An ICE AXE swings down from above, embedding in

his Pryce's chest. Deep. It sticks. Gun goes flying.

Keller drops down from the wing above. Pryce staggers.

Keller kicks him hard.

Pryce goes down.   Keller grabs the gun.

Points it right at Pryce -- before he can shoot --

BANG!BANG! Bullets zip by Keller, who rolls for cover

behind SOME EQUIPMENT. Another rips into his shoulder.

Keller spots Carrie over by the Cat. She fires

continually, forcing him to stay behind cover. The shots

go wide -- she's not yet used to firing with the right

hand.

Keller blindly reaches his gun around the chest -- shoots

back, which --

-- Gives Pryce enough time to painfully crawl for cover

beneath the plane. He's losing blood quick.

Carrie keeps shooting. Bullets PING OFF THE TOOL CHEST.

They stop. Carrie has to reload.

Keller makes his move. Fires at Carrie and sprints for

his plane. Runs right by pole with a large red button

attached to it. Slams it.

HANGAR DOORS BEGIN TO RUMBLE OPEN

The TEMPERATURE immediately begins to PLUMMET as winter

is let inside.

Keller keeps shooting.   Runs out of bullets.   Leaps into

the idling Otter.

Carrie makes her move.   Dashes toward him, firing away.

Bullets PLANT in the WINDSHIELD, but can't penetrate --

glass is too thick -- protection from the cold.

Keller throttles. Begins to move the Otter forward

toward the opening doors.

Carrie dashes to Pryce. Sees Delfy get to his feet.

Face bloody. He moves to Pryce.

CONTINUED: (2)

She gets over to the guys quickly, giving Delfy a visual

once over. He'll be fine, but things look bad for Pryce.

He's bleeding profusely.

She kneels beside him -- pulls the tip of the axe out of

his chest.

Delfy looks to the hangar doors, which are nearly open.

His eyes flutter shut.   Carrie slaps his face --

Puts her hand directly on the wound.   Applies pressure.

Blood continues to ooze.

She looks over to Keller just as his plane exits the

hangar.

Looks back to Pryce's wound -- won't stop bleeding.

They lift him to his feet. Haul ass to the front of the

hangar the best they can. Go outside.

EXT. HANGAR - CONTINUOUS

The two of them place the now unconscious Pryce to the

ground.

Carrie grabs Delfy's hands. Puts them directly on the

bloody wound. Surprisingly, he stays focused.

Looks Delfy right in the eye.

CONTINUED:

Pryce moans.

Carrie rips open Pryce's jacket and liner.

Scoops up an armful of wind-blown ice. Starts packing it

around him. Keeps repeating the motion.

She keeps shooting looks to Keller's departing plane

moving toward the runway.

The cold hits Pryce, shocking him awake.

She holds him down.

Carrie snags the two-way off her hip like it's a quick

draw. Keys it.

Beat.

Carrie doesn't wait for an answer.     Gives Delfy the two-

way.

CONTINUED: (2)

Carrie stands.   Determined.   Sprints back into the

hangar.

INT. HANGAR - CONTINUOUS

On a full sprint, Carrie dashes over to the Snowmobiles.

Coughs. Spits blood. Doesn't stop her. She jumps on

one. Fires it up. Uses her left palm to steer -- blood

starts to seep through the gauze. She quickly bundles

up, then guns it.

Rubber treads grip. Smoke rises. She races it across

the cement floor and out the hangar.

EXT. HANGAR - CONTINUOUS

Off in the distance, Keller's heading for the front of

the runway -- has to turn around to take off into the

wind.

Carrie veers off, targeting the tunnel to ASB.    Hits her

light as she races in.

INT. TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

Carrie's light silhouettes Murphy and a couple of his

guys as they head toward her. She doesn't even slow down

as she blows right by them.

INT. KELLER'S PLANE - SAME

Desperation clings to his face as he turns the plane onto

the runway. His wound oozes blood -- eats the pain as he

gives it full throttle. Starts to pick up speed. Heads

down his strip of freedom.

EXT. SIDE OF RUNWAY - OPPOSITE END - SAME

A funnel of bumpy light spreads across the ice before

Carrie on the snowmobile.

CONTINUED:

She holds tight as she burns a big U-TURN around one of

the berms and onto the runway.   Heads straight for the

lights of Keller's plane.

INSIDE KELLER'S PLANE

He sees Carrie.

INTERCUT:

She targets him like a Japanese zero.       Hundred yards and

closing.

He's pushing to get airborne.        Seventy-five yards between

them.

Gap narrows fast.    Fifty yards.

Stay on Carrie. Looks like suicide. She suddenly

swerves a hard left, disappearing behind a berm --

INSIDE WITH KELLER

He bears a momentary sense of triumph, starts to get

airborne -- until -- LAUNCHING UP OFF THE BERM is

Carrie's snowmobile! She bails, letting it continue

right toward him like a heat seeking missile as she

tumbles down the berm.

Keller's pov - a THOUSAND POUNDS of snowmobile comes at

him fast -- obliterates the cockpit.

CARRIE'S POV - AS THE IMPACT

Cripples the plane, pitching it sideways. A wing catches

the runway, CATAPULTING the entire plane into a cartwheel

of disaster as it veers off the runway and --

-- EXPLODES INTO A FIERY ERUPTION OF FLAME AND DEBRIS!

Resume -

Carrie slowly gets to her feet. The flames reflecting

off her goggles. She heads to the wreckage. The cold

and blowing snow extinguishing the flames quickly.

AT THE WRECKAGE

CONTINUED:

Carrie approaches. Only a sputtering of flame remains on

the front of the twisted remnants of the Otter's cockpit.

The aft seems relatively intact. Carrie looks in.

Sees the charred and already frozen remains of Keller.

In the back -- the charred duffle bag. She moves closer.

Reaches in through a broken window.       Pulls it out to the

runway.

Unzips it.    Is confused.    No cannisters.   Only survival

gear.

INT. MEDICAL CLINIC - SOON AFTER

Delfy, along with Murphy and his two guys, carry Pryce

in. Doc's in the back room with two others, loading the

BODYBAGS onto a cart.

Doc quickly moves into the front room.      The other two

follow. Curious.

Doc springs into action, pulling on gloves.       Pryce's

face, ashen.

They usher him onto one. He looks to Delfy who still has

his hand on Pryce's wound.

Doc shifts his attention to one of Murphy's guys --

The guy heads for it.

Carrie enters. She's still in her ECW gear.        Heart sinks

when she sees Pryce.

CONTINUED:

Doc leans over Pryce's pale form.        Examines.

As Doc gets an IV going, he looks to Carrie --

Murphy's walkie on his hip CRACKLES to life.

INT. LC-130 - SAME

Rhonda's standing up front with the pilot and Copilot,

watching the horizon where dark storm clouds are coming

at them like a tidal wave. Brings a walkie to her

lips...

INT. MEDICAL       CLINIC - ASB - SAME

Murphy looks to Doc.

Doc, who's wrestling with deep contemplation, looks to

Carrie -- she sees the answer's no.

CONTINUED:

The guys head for the back --

As Doc looks at Pryce -- knowing he needs him...

Doc looks to Carrie, who's thankful --

The guys after the bodies look to Murphy for a decision.

Murphy and Carrie exchange a quick look -- closure.

He takes off with the others.

EXT. LC - 130 - RIGHT AFTER

The wind   is hurricane fierce as Murphy and his two men

are just   about to board the plane. Murphy looks to the

storm --   a forboding darkness getting closer by the

second.    He realizes they might not make it.

EXT. RUNWAY - ASB - RIGHT AFTER

The LC-130's jet engines roars as he gains speed down the

runway -- faster and faster, then it suddenly gets

swallowed in the storm -- like an avalanche covering a

skier.

Camera stays on the fast moving storm, the plane, nowhere

in sight, until --

The LC-130 finally pushes out the front of it --

AIRBORNE. Takes off into the horizon, where we see that

the sun is just about to set.

INT. MEDICAL CLINIC - ASB - LATER

Carrie is standing next to Pryce on the examination

table. He's been bandaged up. Eyes closed. Looks

thrashed. An IV drip hangs from a stand on wheels.

She's looking at him with soft, caring eyes -- been

through a lot. He slowly opens his. Tries to smile, not

easy.

She shakes her head --

They both think on it for a moment.

CONTINUED:

Pryce thinks hard -- he's got nothing.

A SQUEAKY NOISE in the back of the room draws their

attention. It's Doc coming through with the cart -- a

bodybag on top.

He continues pushing the gurney toward them --

Doc rolls the gurney behind her --

Carrie turns, looks at Doc as he wheels the gurney by.

She sees it's Weiss' name on the tag, but something

disturbing catches Carrie's eye -- it's Weiss' LEFT LEG

pressing against the bag. Although the plastic is

clouded, she'd swear his LEFT CALF has a LONG LINE OF

STITCHES running down the side.

His voice pulls her focus.          She masks her startle...

CONTINUED: (2)

Doc continues on out the door.

Pryce sees that she's bothered --

She heads out the door.

INT. CONNECTING TUNNEL TO SCIENCE BUILDING - LATER

Carrie slips in. We've been here before -- this is where

she chased Rubin.

Darkness creeps in, phantom like, as the remaining

daylight FADES OUT through the row of windows that run

along the side. Carrie's plunged into inky black.

WINTER HAS SET IN.

She HEARS the Science Lab door open before her -- peers

through the dark blanket to see Doc walking toward her.

Carrie slips in between two bookcases, trying to stay

tight against the wall. Doc walks right by and out the

door.

She rises to her feet. Hurries down to the end.

Disappears into the science building.

INT. SCIENCE LAB - CONTINUOUS

Carrie enters. Turns on the light. Illuminates the lab

stations, and the busted open doors of the Ready Room.

Heads for the freezer.

INT. WALK-IN FREEZER - SCIENCE LAB - CONTINUOUS

Carrie opens the door.    Illuminates the interior with her

light.

CONTINUED:

Storage racks of frozen science samples line the three

walls. Lying on the floor are the bodies of Mooney,

Rubin, Weiss and Keller.

Carry goes to Weiss' body. Kneels next to him. Goes to

unzip the bodybag, but sees that it's been locked with a

plastic cinch.

Pulls out her knife. Holds the light steady in her mouth

as she cuts the cinch. Unzips the bag.

Her light travels down his body to his left leg. She

rolls it slightly for a better look. The truth hits her

like a sledge hammer. There it is, like standing center

stage in her light, the ROW OF STITCHES holding a deep

gash tight together.

She's about to stand and walk out, but she stops herself.

Thinks about that leg, those stitches. The fact that Doc

lied to her. Pans her light over at the other bodies on

the floor. Her light pans back, explores the rest of

Weiss' upper body -- sees a dried river of blood that's

run out from under his armpit.

She raises Weiss' arm.    More stitches.

She cuts through them. Skin splits to reveal the BOTTOM

OF A CANNISTER that's been stuffed inside his chest. She

reaches in and pulls it out. Even has rust on the

bottom. Carrie's confused -- IT'S NOT LIKE ANY OF THE

CANNISTERS PRYCE SHOWED HER PHOTOS OF. It look more like

THE ICE CORE CONTAINER SHE SAW AT MCMURDO.

She contemplates opening it for a moment, then places her

hand on the top. Begins to twist. It loosens easily.

Pulls the lid off. Looks at it. Whatever it is, it's

frozen. Tilts the can slightly, and out slides a FOOT

LONG ICE CORE SAMPLE. Can't quite figure it out, until

she shines her light on it --

The freezer DANCES WITH GLISTENING LIGHT. The core

sample is PACKED FULL OF DIAMONDS. She looks to the

other two bodies.

She opens Mooney's bag. Sees his chest is uneven -- more

cylinders inside. Repeats the action with Rubin. Same

thing.

Carrie slowly stands -- the betrayal almost too much.

CONTINUED: (2)

She turns -- Doc is standing right BEHIND HER.

He turns and walks out of the freezer.

INT. SCIENCE LAB - CONTINUOUS

Carrie carefully follows. Sees he's heading for KELLER'S

ICE AXE in the ready room, that someone's removed from

being wedged outside, onto the now uprighted LAB CART

Pryce used to bust open the door.

He does. Turns back to her. But there has been a subtle

shift inside him -- something illogical.

She has a realization.

His callus disregard for human life rocks her.

Doc looks at her.   She's not sure if it's registering.

CONTINUED:

He turns back to the ice axe and starts walking towards

it.

She pulls the gun out from inside her liner, her mind a

whirl of limited options and grim solutions.

He nears the ice axe on the cart --

Carrie cocks back the trigger --

Her knuckle on her trigger finger goes white as she

wrestles with her emotions.

With that...he walks right past the ICE AXE and into the

READY ROOM. She's confused.

But he's not listening.

The TEMPERATURE GAUGE on the wall reads: -82.

He looks at her.

Carrie crosses the room as he grabs onto the outside

door's latch.

He musters a smile --

CONTINUED: (2)

Using both hands on the latch, he pulls. THE DOOR BLASTS

OPEN, filling the space between Carrie and Doc with

violent winds and blowing snow.

Doc's throws one last look to Carrie, then takes two

steps out the door.

Disappears into the blanket of white.

Wind and cold storm into the room against Carrie, who

remains standing still like a statue. Emotionally

drained. Numb. Freezing to death -- tears frozen to her

cheeks.

A shadow passes by her -- it's Pryce. He's hunkered over

in pain, but forcing himself against the driving force of

the wind into the Ready Room.

Latches onto the door. It takes everything he's got, but

he manages to get it closed. Instant silence.

Cold to the bone, he grabs a jacket off the racket.

Approaches Carrie, who remains staring at the closed

door. The effects of the chill and Doc's decision

apparent.

Pryce wraps the coat around her shoulders.   Gently leads

her away.

Super: THREE MONTHS LATER

INT. CARRIE'S OFFICE - ASB

The sounds of lapping surf and distant seagulls serenades

us like a rhythmic lullaby as we --

CU on sand with a shadow of a palm tree casting over top

of two pairs of feet -- intertwined.

Slowly widen -- to see Carrie and Pryce, kicking back on

lawn chairs, side-by-side. Two heat lamps pouring out

bright, warm light. A cut out piece of paper in the

shape of a palm leaf is taped to one of the lamps --

throwing the shadow.

Pryce has a small bandage over his shoulder.

CONTINUED:

Carrie lies back, rests, eyes closed.

They lie there quietly, relishing the moment.

Carrie turns over on her stomach -- lets the heat warm

her back.

There's a new calender on the wall, where the days of

Winter-over have been marked off -- long way to go.

EXT. ASB BASE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

Pull away from the building, which fades into the icy

darkness and howling wind of the Antarctic winter.

THE END
