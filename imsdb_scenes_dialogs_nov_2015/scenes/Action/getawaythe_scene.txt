A LONG TABLE HAS BEEN SET UP AT THE HEAD OF THE ROOM, several

Prison Officials and Parol Board Members are seated facing

the length of the room.

Seated at one end of the table is an Irish looking Man;

floridly handsome and a bit overweight, his red hair is

beginning to grey. The Nameplate in front of him reads J.

BEYNON.

Doc enters the room and seats himself near two other

PRISONERS, the GUARD stands back against the wall.

CONTINUED:

Another table has been set up; this one near the seated

Prisoners, for their LEGAL COUNSELS -- SEVERAL LAWYERS

He works carefully at a toothpick suspension bridge. Doc

glues the final pieces into place...

Around the cubicle his personal effects can be seen, a

picture of an attractive woman, several battered paperbacks.

Doc continues looking at the bridge... then suddenly begins

smashing it to pieces with his right fist.

INT. PRISON - VISITING BUNGALOW - DAY

DOC IS SEATED... WAITING. CAROL enters the darkened room and

seats herself opposite Doc. They are separated by a wide

table and net of wire meshing that springs upward from mid-

point between them.

He simply stares back at her. Carol's finely honed features

compliment a face that at first glance is pretty,at a second

glance shows willful strength. Doc continues looking at

Carol.

Doc is silent.

Doc is silent.

Get to Beynon, tell him I'm for sale. His price.

She looks at him.

She hesitates, tries to touch him through the mesh. Gets up

and leaves. Doc remains unmoving.

EXT. COUNTRY COURTHOUSE - SAN MARCOS, TEXAS - DAY

CAROL MOVES TO THE BACK OF THE LARGE BTJILDING AND UP A REAR

STAIRWAY TOWARD THE OVERHEAD OFFICE.

INT. COURTHOUSE

CAROL ENTERS A LEGAL OFFICE, WEARING A SOFT BILLOWY dress.

She looks very good.

A middle aged SECRETARY looks up at Carol. A short balding

man (THE ACCOUNTANT) in his forties works at a large desk

across the room from the Secretary. He seems totally occupied

with his bookwork.

NEAR THE ACCOUNTANT THREE MEN ARE SEATED ON A DAVENPORT

They are dressed casually; by the look of them they might be

anything at all but all three have commonality; they are

professionals.

HAYHOE - Thirty years old, buck teeth and blue eyes, a bitter

ender.

CULLY - Well padded strength, large hands and wrists that pop

out of his buttoned shirtsleeves...

SWAIN - a little older and a little smarter than the other

two, his narrow features allow no warmth.

SECRETARY Yes?

The Accountant nods to the Secretary, she points Carol

towards a door leading to an inner office.

DOC AND CAROL - PACES, PARTS OP BODIES, EMPHASIS ON HANDS, in

bed... his hand touching the soft white skin beneath her

stomach.

BACK WITHIN THE OFFICE THE THREE MEN LOOK AFTER CAROL

CONTINUED:

Cully looks startled.

portion of skin.

CAROL APPROACHES BEYNON'S DESK WITH A NERVOUSLY

DETERMINED STRIDE

Beynon looks at her... then lets their eyes meet.

CONTINUED:

A MAN'S FINGERS STARING AT THE ANKLET ON THE WOMAN'S LEG then

drawing an imaginary line upward... a woman's hand wearing a

wedding ring comes up to meet it.

INT. SANDERSON PRISON OFFICE CORRIDOR - DAY

A UNIFORMED GUARD LEADS DOC DOWN THE HALLWAY, they turn a

corner and go into a small private room, Doc is now dressed

in civilian clothes.

Doc catches sight of himself in a small mirror. He stops

looking uncertainly at the image... and then moves on with

the guard.

EXT. PRISON - DAY

DOC EXITS THE PRISON AND STANDS WAITING NEAR THE AUTO GATE.

He looks down the two-lane blacktop road that runs along the

edge of the penitentiary... Doc turns, looks again at the

prison... four years is a long time.

A dark Caddy is parked down the road.

INT. CADDY - DAY

THE ACCOUNTANT OR SWAIN SITS BEHIND THE WHEEL. He stares at

Doc. Doc crosses to him.

He gestures and drives away.

DOC IS STILL WAITING

He leans against a low stone wall that lines the entrance

way... The duffel bag rests beside him.

A late model Ford approaches, stops near Doc... the passenger

side door opens from the inside... Carol is driving... Doc

and Carol look at one another, their eyes holding several

moments.

INT. FORD - DAY

BOTH CAROL AND DOC ARE VERY TENSE.

They look at each other for a moment. Carol leans forward...

Doc, inhibited by the closeness of the prison walls, kisses

her lightly, but with affection...

She starts the car, slips it into gear.

EXT. HIGHWAY

THE FORD MOVES ALONG THE DESERTED ROADSIDE, crossing the

border and passing into the State of Texas.

INT. THE FORD

DOC ALTERNATELY STARES AT THE PASSING SCENERY, THEN BACK to

Carol.

A pause.

CONTINUED:

He smiles, then reaches over and gently touches a strand of

Carol's hair.

EXT. RIVER - GRASSY BANK - SERIES OP ANGLES - DAY

THEY PARK THE CAR AND EXIT. DOC MOVES A LITTLE AHEAD OF

Carol. He sits on the bank watching the kids play.

YOUNG BOYS SWING ON A ROPE THAT HANGS OVER THE PALLS

COLLEGE KIDS, SOME ARE SWIMMING, SOME STUDYING, SOME just

grooving.

AN OLDER COUPLE SIT ON THE BANK, THEIR FEET IN THE WATER

CAROL SITS DOWN NOT TOO CLOSE. DOC IS SILENT FOR LONG

moments. Carol starts to speak but doesn't. He is

preoccupied, lost in his own thoughts.

Finally he stands, looking down at her. He slowly takes off

his coat, folds it, lays it on the grass, then turns and

starts walking towards a tree.

Suddenly he takes off his shoes, breaks into a run and dives

for the rope.

CAROL IS ALREADY ON HER FEET, HER SWEATER OFF, SHOES kicked

aside, she runs after him and hits the water with an awkward

splash. She is a brief second behind him.

THEY COME UP TOGETHER, AND HE LAUGHS WITH THE PURE JOY of

being free and alive. She joins him, in his laughter and with

their arms around each other, they turn as they are swept

down stream.

INT. EL OSO CONDOMINIUM - NIGHT

THROUGH AN OPEN WINDOW A PORTION OF THE EXTERIOR BUILDING CAN

BE SEEN... The interior is cozy and Carol. Carol has lived

here almost two years. On the wall there is a poster (which

will be on the wall of every room that they stay in from now

on).

CONTINUED:

Around the room are drying clothes. Carol is ironing with a

steam iron.

Doc is sitting at a table with a Colt .45 in front of him and

a .32 automatic. He is field stripping. There is a bowl of

peaches on the table.

She crosses to him and gives him a hug, then returns to her

ironing.

She holds up some 11 by 14 photographs in front of him.

CONTINUED: (2)

RAFTER A MOMENT)

How much is the score?

She laughs softly, and goes to a cupboard and takes out four

bottles of whisky, four glasses and a bowl of ice. Doc smiles

at her and begins sampling.

Doc reaches across the table and touches her hand gently.

CONTINUED:

A pause. He continues stroking her arm.

He stands, kisses her gently. She stands and they move toward

the stairs.

INT. BEDROOM

THEY ENTER THE BEDROOM AND SIT SIDE BY SIDE ON THE DOUBLE

bed. They both sit rigidly. Doc's eyes are on Carol, she

stares vacantly expectant.

Doc begins to unbutton her blouse, it comes undone with

agonizing slowness... Carol pulls her shoulders back helping

Doc drop the garment down to her waist.

Doc hesitates, then carefully touches her shoulder... her

hair... he kisses her... Doc gently eases himself away from

Carol.

He again moves close... Doc reaches around to unsnap her bra

as Carol places both of her arms around him, holding him

tightly...

CONTINUED:

Doc unsnaps the top fastener, the second one catches, remains

unyielding... He closes his eyes for a second... The pressure

of the moment is again too intense for Doc. Once more he

pulls gently away from her. Carol looks at him, her eyes very

reassuring.

She stands, begins to remove her skirt.

She sits beside him again, takes his hand in hers...

They look at one another. A pause. He kisses her; their

embrace pulls them back across the bed.

But she has little chance as he begins to make love to her.

A DIFFERENT ANGLE

DOC AND CAROL ARE LYING IN BED.

INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

DOC WEARING A ROBE IS COOKING EGGS AND DRINKING WHISKY. Carol

enters.

She exits and returns with some clothes. He looks at them.

They start eating.

A pause. Carol looks directly at Doc.

He picks up a fork and looks through it, as if it is prison

bars. She takes his hand and gently takes the fork from him.

CONTINUED:

Carol begins to laugh softly.

Doc smiling, still holding her hand, leads her from the

table.

THEY CAN'T KEEP THEIR HANDS OFF EACH OTHER AND LAUGHING with

complete release they half carry each other into the bedroom.

EXT. RIVER WALK CANAL - SAN ANTONIO - DAY

BEYNON IS IN THE BOAT. LUNCH HAS BEEN SET. DOC COMES ABOARD.

Doc sits.

Pedal boats cut through the water in the background.

The Accountant and Swain are with Beynon in the boat. Apart

from them two pedal boats come up behind Beynon's boat. Cully

and Hayhoe are in one, and two other men are pedalling along

in a boat numbered 13.

Beynon nods toward the Accountant. He then turns and gestures

toward the other two men.

CONTINUED:

It's not a big bank but it handles cash deposits for an oil

company... half a million... it's a family thing, the brother

of the bank director is on the board of directors at Con-Sol

Oil... Beacon City.

Beynon nods to the two men and they immediately begin to

approach in their paddle boat.

RUDY BUTLER -- hard eyes and an easy smile; obviously a heavy

gun...

PRANK JACKSON -- young, mid-twenties, ruddy face and blond

hair; a small man with blank, insensitive features.

As the two men arrive...

CONTINUED: (2)

INT. HOTEL ROOM BEACON CITY - DAY

THREE TRIPODS HAVE BEEN SET UP NEAR THE HEAVILY CURTAINED

window. On two of them huge sets of binoculars have been

racked into place, beside them on a tripod is a lectern with

notepad and pencil... Doc and Carol peer through the

binoculars then write several notations on the paper.

Both Doc and Carol drink coffee from paper cups... the

residue of dinners served on hotel trays lie about the room.

Doc and Carol share a sandwich as they work.

unobtrusively eyes the bank.

INT. BEACON CITY BANK - DAY 5^

DOC, WEARING HIS SUIT AND GLASSES, STANDING AT A TELLER'S

of wanted bank robbers.

His eyes alert and probing.

EXT. MAIN STREET BEACON CITY - ANGLES - DAY

DOC DROPS A LETTER INTO A CORNER MAIL BOX, THEN BUYS A PAPER

from a coin dispenser. His eyes find a Beacon City Policeman

idly talking to a citizen... a police car is near the

Officer, the driver's side door open... mounted on the dash

is a shotgun. Doc tucks the paper under his arm and moves off

down the street.

colored raincoats, a huge pair of wirecutters, road maps,

chemical containers and four sticks of dynamite, four visas

and two passports and several padded U.S. Army, super bullet

proof vests which are not vests at all, more a shield.

Rudy and Jackson stand near the table. Carol is seated. She

nervously runs her hand along the edge of one of the road

maps. Doc is holding one of the vests.

The wall behind the table is dominated by diagrams and maps,

and photos which show the interior of the Beacon City Bank,

the Bank vault, and several diagrams of the main street of

Beacon City, a Beacon City Police car, and a detailed

reproduction of the Beacon City main sewage system, including

electrical wiring, a detailed road map of the town and

EXT. MAIN STREET - BEACON CITY, TEXAS - DAY

A sleepy, traditional municipality...

A DAPPER GENTLEMAN IN HIS EARLY FIFTIES WALKS ALONG THE

SIDEWALK. He is the PRESIDENT of the First Bank of Beacon

City -- nodding to a few passersby, he stops at the front

door of the bank, knocks twice. A BANK GUARD opens the door

and the Bank President moves inside.

VISIBLE ON THE GLASS DOOR

sign that reads:

FIRST BANK OF BEACON CITY

Founded 1911 Hours: 9:00 AM to 2:00 PM Weekdays Only

INT. THE BANK

THE PRESIDENT SNAPS ON A BANK OF IRRIDESCENT LIGHTS. Several

TELLERS have begun setting up for the day's commerce...

INT. PANEL TRUCK

DOC SHIFTS HIS POSITION SLIGHTLY, THEN   PULLS HIS .45 OUT from

beneath his jacket. Doc breaks out the   clip, examines it,

snaps it back to position. He replaces   the gun under his

jacket -- the gesture seemingly more a   mannerism than a

precaution.

A huge pair of tongs and the massive wire cutters rest on the

floor of the truck near Doc, along with a black leather

suitcase.

CAROL IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT, Beacon City appears on the

horizon through the windshield...

INT. BANK

THE PRESIDENT BEGINS TURNING THE COMBINATION on the massive

door as the vault begins to open...

RUDY - IN THE BUICK - DRIVING DOWN THE ROADWAY near the

outskirts of town. A Texas Highway Patrol car passes, moving

in the opposite direction...

JACKSON - IN THE HAY TRUCK - PULLS ON A PAIR OF BLACK GLOVES,

then checks his watch.

A WATCH FACE SHOWS THE TIME AT 8:56.

THE WATCH BELONGS TO DOC. He looks expectantly towards Carol.

THE PANEL TRUCK is now within the commercial district of

Beacon City. Rudy's Buick is visible a hundred yards behind.

THE HAY TRUCK drives off Main Street and into an open field

near a corner of the town.

Jackson jumps down out of the cab of the truck and crosses to

the sidewalk.

Rudy's Buick pulls over and Jackson gets into the passenger

seat. The Buick then cruises back out onto Main Street...

CAROL - IN THE VAN - APPROACHES AN INTERSECTION. Through the

truck's window a traffic signal appears.

RUDY PULLS THE BUICK OFF THE MAIN DRAG and onto a side

street. Another turn and he again moves parallel to the Main

Street...

INT. BANK

THE BANK PRESIDENT LEAVES THE VAULT, allowing the heavy door

to stand open.

A LATTICE-WORK BARRIER made of wrought-iron is pulled across

the vault opening... the Bank President snaps the latch-lock

closed.

CAROL - IN THE PANEL TRUCK. She pulls the van carefully to a

stop at the intersection as the stoplight blinks red... She

turns her eyes back to Doc...

DOC, CATCHES HER LOOK, then instantly springs into action. He

reaches down, pulls a hatch-like cover up from the floor of

the truck, revealing the road below... a portion of a manhole

cover is visible.

CAROL ROLLS THE TRUCK SLIGHTLY FORWARD

ON THE STREET - SEVERAL CARS can be seen moving up behind the

panel truck.

DOC GRABS THE TONGS, inserts the ends into the manhole cover

notches. He lifts the tongs and slides the manhole cover

forward. Doc drops down through the truck hatchway and into

open manhole, carrying the huge cutters with him. As he

disappears from sight...

98 RUDY DRIVING ON THE SIDE AVENUE, still moving parallel 98

to Main Street. The Buick is now geographically well forward

of the panel truck. Jackson stares at his watch.

Rudy makes a sharp left. The car accelerates, its wheels

begin to quietly whine.

Main Street comes back into view...

CAROL WATCHING THE SIGNAL... still red...

A MAN IN A PONTIAC eases to a stop behind the panel truck. He

watches the signal.

DOC STANDING IN THE SEWER PIPE. He turns on a flashlight,

moves ahead. His feet slosh through the six-inch-high murky

water.

CONTINUED:

Doc shines the light on several ankle-thick conduit lines

that run along the sewer wall... He moves down the dark oval

corridor...

EXT. THE BANK

THE GUARD OPENS THE FRONT DOOR, allowing the morning PATRONS

to enter.

INT. THE BANK

THE PRESIDENT SMILES UPON SEEING THE CUSTOMERS. He looks over

to the wood-frame clock on the far wall.

THE CLOCK READS 9:00 EXACTLY

RUDY - IN THE BUICK - MAKES ANOTHER LEFT TURN, now back onto

Main Street.

THE BANK APPEARS A HALF-BLOCK AWAY through the car window.

Rudy and Jackson pull their watch caps down over their faces;

the holes cut into the caps are wide enough to recognize a

disparity between their features...

MAIN STREET - THE TRAFFIC SIGNAL has now blinked to green.

CAROL IS GRINDING AWAY AT THE DEAD ENGINE of the panel

truck...

THE MAN IN THE PONTIAC leans on his HORN... other cars behind

him begin to HONK.

CAROL LEANS OUT OF THE CAB OF THE PANEL TRUCK and gestures

for the cars to pass her. She again GRINDS away at the

engine.

DOC'S WATCH - SHOWING 9:01.

DOC STANDS AT A MASSIVE CONNECTING BOX where four 112 strands

of the conduit intersect. He puts the wire cutters to the

first conduit, grasps the insulated handles and with a

crunching POP, he cuts through the conduit with one bite. Doc

immediately starts on the next strand.

CAROL - ON MAIN STREET - trying to start the engine.

THE BUICK SLAMS TO A STOP IN FRONT OF THE BANK. Rudy Il4 and

Jackson pull open the car doors.

DOC CUTTING THE LAST AND LARGEST CONDUIT.

INT. THE BANK

THE BANK GUARD is placing a local high school basketball

schedule and display into position.

SEVERAL PATRONS have formed small lines and are transacting

business with the Tellers.

The wall clock shows the time at 9:02.

RUDY AND JACKSON BURST THROUGH THE GLASS DOOR. They stand

shoulder to shoulder, guns extended the full length of their

arms. Beneath the mask Rudy's smile is visible.

THE BANK GUARD LOOKS UP PROM THE BASKETBALL DISPLAY. His eyes

widen... both guns are leveled directly at him...

simultaneously the lights go out...

THE BANK PRESIDENT DESPERATELY PUSHES THE ALARM BUTTON near

his desk. (INSERT: Button and bell.) Nothing happens.

CAROL - ON MAIN STREET - trying to start the engine.

INT. A DENTIST'S OFFICE

THE D.D.S. TORTURES A BALDING PATIENT with a drill. The

PATIENT groans, lifts one leg in the air from the pain.

When the power goes, the Dentist quizzically raises the drill

and examines it. The Patient pants in relief.

AN ELECTRIC WEATHER/TIME INDICATOR - above the town square...

as the bulbs dim...

DOC RUNNING DOWN THE SEWER; stopping at the manhole he

scrambles up the permanent ladderway, tossing his wire

cutters up into the truck parked over him.

CAROL - IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT - again she tries to start the

engine.

DOC PULLING HIMSELF BACK UP INTO THE VAN with a gymnastic

thrust he quickly slides the manhole cover with the tongs.

CAROL - the engine still won't start.

DOC DROPS THE HATCH DOOR back down into place on the floor of

the truck...

CONTINUED:

CAROL TURNS THE IGNITION SWITCH BACK ON...

CAROL - AS THE ENGINE ROARS TO LIFE she engages the

gearshift. The truck begins to move forward. Suddenly, the

motor does STALL.

DOC'S PACE TIGHTENS. The cars behind the van continue

HONKING.

CAROL - AGAIN GRINDING AWAY AT THE ENGINE. Her lips are

compressed into a thin line... After a moment... the motor

catches, the truck again moves forward.

DOC PICKS UP THE LARGE BLACK SUITCASE from the floor of the

panel truck, then begins to move toward the cab and Carol.

THE PANEL TRUCK WHIPS OFF MAIN STREET and onto a side avenue.

Carol pulls the van up to the curbway, jerking to a stop.

DOC IS NOW IN THE FRONT SEAT BESIDE CAROL. He pulls the truck

door open, then hesitates. He touches her arm, their eyes

meet briefly, both their faces warming for a moment. Doc

gives her a casual wink then quietly exits the truck.

ON THE SIDEWALK

DOC TURNS AND BEGINS WALKING toward an open alleyway. Behind

him the panel truck pulls smoothly away.

WALKING UP THE ALLEY - DOC PULLS ON A PAIR OF BLACK GLOVES.

He turns again, now moving down a totallydeserted side alley.

The alley opens at one end onto a back street; the opposite

end is bounded by a large brick building. Doc removes his

pistol from his coat pocket, then approaches a doorway along

the side of the brick building. At the last moment he pulls

down the watch cap mask.

INT. BANK

RUDY DISENGAGES THE LATCH on the side door.

EXT. ALLEY

DOC KICKS THE DOOR OPEN with a violent jerk of his leg.

INT. THE BANK

RUDY'S GUN IS TRAINED PROM THE BACK OF THE BUILDING over the

Tellers and Patrons, spread-eagled across the floor. Their

heads are down; several of them are trembling.

DOC STANDS HOLDING THE .45 IN ONE HAND, suitcase in the

other. He moves into the building, shutting the door behind

him.

RUDY IS NOW STATIONED NEAR THE FRONT DOOR, ready to intercept

any incoming bank patrons -- he covers the room from the end

opposite Jackson.

Rudy stands near the Bank Guard's outstretched right hand --

The Guard's head is bloodied from Rudy's pistol whipping. His

gun has been kicked against the wall. A short distance away

Rudy is watching.

THE BANK PRESIDENT lies face down on the floor, directly

under the arc of Jackson's gun... who is continually turning

to watch the Guard.

DOC QUICKLY CROSSES THE DISTANCE between the side door and

the vault, passing the Bank President. He slips the .45 into

his jacket side pocket, sets down the suitcase, then either

cuts the lock or picks it.

CAROL - IN THE VAN - She has stopped the panel truck near the

deserted lot where the hay truck is parked.

She drops the bomb-laden grocery bag inside the truckbed. She

moves back towards the van...

IN THE BANK

DOC FINISHES,, RIPS THE DOOR OPEN, lifts the suitcase and

moves into the vault.

RUDY LOOKS AT THE BLOODIED GUARD, notes the distance

separating the man from his gun. Though unconscious, the

Guard's head begins to move.

JACKSON HOLDS HIS GUN HAND FULLY EXTENDED. Again he takes a

brief moment to glance nervously over to the open vault and

at the Guard.

ANGLES AND INSERTS - THE VAULT is lined with safety deposit

boxes and large cabinet drawers.

CONTINUED:

A metal table stands off-center, the black suitcase resting

on its surface. Doc opens the satchel. He then pulls open one

of the cabinet drawers nearby and begins tossing banded money

pads into the open suitcase.

THE BANK PRESIDENT LIES NEAR THE OPEN VAULT. He listens to

the SOUNDS of Doc at work. He slightly cranes his neck,

trying to get a look at the thief inside the vault.

RUDY WATCHING THE FRONT DOOR. A PATRON enters; Rudy gestures

with the gun... she hits the deck.

JACKSON IS GETTING MORE NERVOUS by the minute...

DOC continues working within the vault.

THE WOMAN, now on the floor, quietly crying.

JACKSON watching the Guard.

RUDY watching Jackson. Calling out time.

THE BANK GUARD, glassy-eyed, but conscious; he has the look

of a prizefighter who has just suffered a knockout, but is

ready for one more round.

THE BANK PRESIDENT in his prone position. He looks at

Jackson, then to the vault.

THE PANEL TRUCK - now at the other end of Main Street.

CAROL EXITS THE VAN, carries the second sack to a large

rubbish bin in front of an empty store. She deposits the

grocery bag...

DOC WORKING. The suitcase is now filled. He snaps the

fasteners shut .

DOC EXITS THE VAULT after withdrawing his .45 from his coat

pocket .

JACKSON SEES DOC LEAVE THE VAULT. He edges around the side of

the tellers' cages toward the front of the bank.

DOC MOVES TOWARDS JACKSON'S OLD VANTAGE POINT NEAR THE SIDE

DOOR. He passes the bank president.

RUDY NOW WATCHES DOC

DOC CARRIES THE HEAVY SUITCASE IN HIS LEFT HAND. He gestures

to Rudy and Jackson with his pistol while moving towards the

side door.

CONTINUED:

JACKSON HALF RUNS PASSING RUDY ON HIS WAY TO THE FRONT

ENTRANCE still watching the Bank Guard.

THE BANK GUARD STILL PUNCH DRUNK PULLS HIMSELF UP TO HIS

HANDS and knees... the Guard looks at his pistol.

DOC STOPS AT THE KICKED IN SIDE DOOR. HE COVERS THE ENTIRE

bank with his gun.

THE BANK GUARD BEGINS TO CRAWL WITH AGONIZING SLOWNESS

towards his pistol.

RUDY EYES STILL ON DOC

JACKSON NOW AT THE FRONT DOOR IS PARALYZED WATCHING THE

GUARD.

DOC GESTURES TO RUDY AND JACKSON TO GET MOVING.

EXT. STREET - DAY

CAROL PARKS THE VAN, CROSSES TO A FORD, GETS IN, DRIVES AWAY.

INT. BANK

THE GUARD HAS MORE THAN HALF CLOSED THE DISTANCE TO THE .38.

JACKSON LEVELS HIS .44.

DOC AND RUDY. BOTH SEE WHAT IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN.

JACKSON PULLS THE TRIGGER THREE TIMES.

THE BANK GUARD'S BODY turns end-over-end from Jackson's

bullets. Some of the bank Patrons SCREAM, others SOB with

fright.

DOC - His eyes are furious.

RUDY AND JACKSON - Rudy shoves Jackson out the front door.

DOC COVERS THEIR EXIT, then slips out the side door and into

the alley.

EXT. MAIN STREET

RUDY GUNS THE BUICK FORWARD, the wheels tearing at the

asphalt. Jackson's shoulders rock back as the big car

accelerates.

CAROL - IN A FORD - suddenly pulls up, filling the roadway

opening.

DOC TOSSES THE SUITCASE into the back of the car... then

slides the pistol under his coat and slips behind the wheel

as Carol slides over to the passenger seat.

INT. THE FORD

DOC PULLS OFF THE WATCH CAP MASK; his face taut.

THE FORD SMOKES OFF as Doc kicks it into gear...

MAIN STREET BEACON CITY A SERIES OF ANGLES

THE BUICK STREAKS DOWN THE CENTER OF THE ROADWAY... Two bombs

detonate into fireballs... The Hay truck blazes upward, bales

instantly igniting.

The grange at the opposite end of town becomes an orange-

flame inferno...

Traffic stalls on the boulevard; Drivers and Pedestrians gawk

at the twin blazes.

RUDY ZIG ZAGS THE BUICK ALONG. Maneuvering through the

stopped traffic.

DOC SLIDES THE FORD THROUGH A RIGHT AND LEFT TURN, emerging

onto smoke-covered Main Street.

The speeding Ford avoids a halting car, then suddenly spins

out of control, jumps across the sidewalk, splinters a wood

bench, and finally slides in a complete circle across the

grass of a small park.

INT. FORD '

DOC LOOKS MORE THAN A LITTLE EMBARRASSED AS CAROL STARES

AT him.

POLICE CARS ROAR BY THEM.

EXT. SMALL PARK

DOC ZIPS THE CAR OFF THE GRASS AND BACK ONTO THE TRAFFIC

CLOGGED ROADWAY.

RUDY DRIVING THROUGH THE BEDLAM. Suddenly a gun appears in

his right hand, aimed at Jackson. The pistol roars bucks,

roars, bucks again. Jackson is shot through the head twice.

THE FORD IS SEVERAL BLOCKS BEHIND RUDY. DOC DOWNSHIFTS

avoiding stalled cars. Carol grasps at both the seat and the

dashboard handholds to maintain her balance.

THE BUICK EMERGES THROUGH DENSE PLUMES OF SMOKE. Fire licks

along the one edge of the sidewalk.

RUDY IN THE BUICK HAS NOW ALMOST CLEARED THE TOWN. He tears

along the highway... sweating a little but becoming cool. He

is a pro. His watch cap is now removed.

ON THE CURVE - Jackson's body is kicked out of the automobile

and bounces across the pavement.

DOC IN THE FORD POWERS ALONG. He approaches the flaming

building, then hits the brakes as ...

A BIG DIESEL TRUCK AND TRAILER is coming in the opposite

direct ion,, jack-knifes across the road, desperately trying

to avoid the cars stopped in the middle of the street .

DOC, AS THE TRUCK AND TRAILER SUDDENLY APPEAR THROUGH the

smoke in front of him, throws the car broadside into a four

wheel drift. Now sideways, then straight, he bumps across the

sidewalk, over a patio of a house, knocking down two pillars,

through a parking lot, taking with it a large cleaners sign,

then bores back onto the road.

RUDY IN THE BUICK STROKING ALONG THE OPEN HIGHWAY. Looks in

the rear view mirror.

RUDY'S POV - THROUGH THE BUICK'S REAR WINDOW, BLACK smoke is

visible billowing skyward.

DOC AND CAROL IN THE FORD NOW DRIVING CALMLY THROUGH the

countryside. A police car with light turning and siren

wailing passes them, heading for the conflagration in Beacon

City. Doc's eyes follow the Patrol Car until it disappears

from sight.

THE BUICK - SERIES OF ANGLES - IT pulls off the highway and

bumps down a dirt road. Rudy strains to hold the big car on

the rutted pathway.

CONTINUED:

The dirt road becomes a lane.

A farm house and barn appear at a clearing. Rudy powers the

car up a fairly steep hill, the crest of which is occupied by

a seemingly abandoned and dilapidated house barn.

RUDY JUMPS OUT OF THE BUICK, trots to the front of the barn

and pulls the double-doors open. A station wagon with wooden-

panel or the usual painted panel sides can be seen within...

THE FORD SWEEPS OFF THE HIGHWAY and onto the dirt road.

WITHIN THE FORD - DOC IS DRIVING. Carol peels off her

sweater. She has worn a faded blouse underneath... She pulls

a ribbon; her hair falls changing her appearance.

RUDY - IN THE BARN - The Buick is now parked near the Station

Wagon. Standing in the shadows, he intently reloads his gun,

then moves towards the large doors of the barn.

CAROL - IN THE PASSENGER SEAT OF THE FORD - she watches as

Doc drives up the lane...

RUDY stands outside the barn as the car approaches.

DOC STUDIES RUDY THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD, watching him wipe

his face with a soiled rag as the car pulls closer...

INT. BARN

DOC PULLS THE FORD TO A STOP just within the double doors. He

passes Rudy, leaving a clear exit pathway for the getaway

station wagon.

DOC JUMPS OUT OF THE FORD AS SOON AS the ignition switch is

cut; Carol a beat behind him on the opposite side.

Rudy moves into the archway created by the barn's open doors.

He stands almost in silhouette as the bright sunlight breaks

around him.

Doc snaps open the door of the car, his back turned to Rudy.

He reaches into the back seat and grasps the black suitcase,

not by the middle handle but by each end, as if it contained

a great weight.

Rudy withdraws the pistol from under his raincoat.

CONTINUED:

Doc straightens, still holding the suitcase. He starts to

turn to Rudy, eyes wide, helpless. Carol fumbles for the gun

in her purse.

Rudy extends his arm, ready to begin the execution. Doc

swings the suitcase around slowly, seemingly ready to face

Rudy's bullets... then he shoots Rudy in the middle of the

chest, Doc's .45 slug driving him backward.

Doc has concealed the pistol in his hand with the satchel. He

drops the suitcase with his first shot, FIRES again, blasting

Rudy in the middle. Two large holes now show at the chest of

Rudy's raincoat.

Rudy is knocked back over the hillock, tumbling down the

precipice and into a grassy meadow below. Doc stands at the

crest of the hill. He looks down as Rudy's body stops

turning. Doc shifts the .45 to his right hand.

Rudy's body lies still.

DOC TURNS QUICKLY AWAY PROM THE HILLTOP, not giving Rudy's

body a second glance. Carol, gun in hand, stands outside the

barn, transfixed.

Doc doesn't answer, motioning her into the car... the getaway

car... as she starts to change clothes... he reloads. Doc

takes a long look at Carol.

THEY GET IN THE CAR AND LEAVE.

EXT. BOTTOM OP HILL - DAY

CAROL IS DRIVING., tooling comfortably along a country road.

Doc is beside her, the suitcase resting in the back seat.

After several moments of silence:

CONTINUED:

Carol takes a deep breath,, then turns her look at the side

window.

Doc leans forward., snaps on the radio.

EXT. ABANDONED FARM - DAY

RUDY BUTLER STUMBLES BACK OVER THE CREST OP THE HILLOCK and

onto the pathway in front of the barn. His figure is slightly

grotesque; the raincoat shows two holes from Doc's .45 slugs,

along with considerable dirt and grass stains picked up on

his ass-over-tea kettle trip to the bottom of the hill. He is

obviously in some pain, his walk is a half-lurch.

EXT. SIDE OF THE BARN - DAY

RUDY TURNS ON A RUSTED TAP which sends all-pocketed water

gurgling down into a mold-covered trough. Rudy pulls off the

yellow raincoat, revealing the fact he has worn one of the

padded bullet-proof vests. Rudy undoes the vest, lets it fall

to his feet. A huge crimson stain shows at his collarbone.

RUDY TOUCHES THE BLOOD WITH HIS RIGHT HAND, then looks at his

hand. Breathing heavily he kneels down and begins to splash

the purling water across his face and then he laughs.

INT. STATION WAGON - DAY

DIALOGUE COMES ON THE RADIO DESCRIBING THE ROBBERY. $750,000

stolen.

Carol starts to open the bag and count.

Doc flicks off the radio then cracks open the windwing. Doc

reflectively studies the roadside ahead. They are heading

along a comfortable tree and meadowlined thoroughfare that

carries only a sparse amount of traffic.

Doc's eyes suddenly narrow on the road ahead.

CONTINUED:

ON THE ROAD AHEAD HIGHWAY PATROLMEN HAVE FORMED a traffic

barricade. Several cars and trucks are being waved through

the check-point. Wearing sunglasses and Stetson hats, the

Uniformed officers make a cursory glance into each passing

vehicle.

DOC ANALYZES THE SITUATION WITHOUT CHANGING EXPRESSION He

slips the station wagon up behind a pickup truck in the line

of slowly-passing vehicles.

She turns, starts to reach into the back. Doc gently catches

her arm, preventing her from moving further.

A YOUNG OFFICER looks into the cab of the pickup, then

glances at the empty flatbed. Another PATROLMAN flanks the

other side of the truck, repeating the procedure. Several

Patrol Cars, fully loaded with additional OFFICERS, are

parked nearby. The pickup truck is waved through. The station

wagon rolls up to the check-point.

DOC ROLLS DOWN HIS WINDOW. He smiles and nods to the Young

Patrolman.

CAROL STUDIES THE OFFICER on her side of the car through the

closed window... the Officer peers back at her then into the

rear seat.

THE STATION WAGON is waved ahead without a second glance by

the Patrolman; Doc accelerates away from the roadblock...

After a moment, Doc leans forward, snapping on the radio.

EXT. THE FARM - RUDY - DAY

Inside the barn, behind the wheel of the panel truck, Rudy's

matted black hair is in contrast to his blanched face. He

starts the engine, painfully bringing it to a ROAR. The panel

truck leaps crazily forward, careening across the barn floor,

SMASHING through the edge of the wooden doors as it bursts

out into the sunlight.

EXT. SMALL TOWN - DAY

The station wagon rolls down the main street and stops near

an outdoor phone booth at a filling station.

INT. STATION WAGON

DOC SHUTS OFF THE ENGINE, PULLS OPEN HIS DOOR.

DOC MOVES INSIDE THE PHONE BOOTH CARRYING A FIST-FULL

of loose change. He begins to dial...

INT. BEYNON'S OFFICE - DAY

THE PHONE RINGS. THE ACCOUNTANT LIFTS THE RECEIVER.

He presses a button on the intercom.

ANOTHER PHONE IN THE OFFICE 234

He presses a button on the intercom.

ANOTHER PHONE IN THE OFFICE.

HAYHOE PICKS UP THE PHONE.

He presses a button on the intercom.

ANOTHER PHONE IN THE OFFICE

SWAIN TURNS AND REACHES FOR THE RECEIVER.

EXT. SMALL TOWN

DOC MOVES TOWARDS THE WAGON, CLIMBS INSIDE.

INT. STATION WAGON.

DOC SLAMS THE DOOR SHUT. CAROL LOOKS ACROSS AT HIM.

CONTINUED:

He starts the engine. The station wagon pulls away.

INT. STATION WAGON

AS IT PULLS OUT OF THE SMALL TOWN.

Doc looks at her for a moment.

CONTINUED:

The wagon continues moving down the road.

EXT. A NARROW DIRT ROAD - LATE AFTERNOON

TWO HOURS BEFORE SUNSET. A CHILL SOUTHWEST WIND is blowing.

The station wagon appears, moving slowly down the roadway,

bouncing along its rutted surface.

AT A SMALL INTERSECTION TWO MAIL BOXES STAND CLOSE to one

another. The name Beynon is printed in black paint on one of

the letter bins. Doc stops the wagon momentarily, looks at

the box, then turns down the indicated road.

EXT. THE STATION WAGON - LATE AFTERNOON

THE STATION WAGON clears the crest of a sage brush hill and

passes camera.

INT. STATION WAGON - LATE AFTERNOON

DOC PARKS THE WAGON UNDER A GNARLED COTTONWOOD TREE in front

of the house. As he shuts off the engine, he pulls the .45

out of his coat pocket and shoves it into his waistband.

Carol watches the gesture. Doc starts to open the car door,

then hesitates.

DOC STEPS OUT OF THE WAGON, then pulls the leather suitcase

out of the back. He quietly shuts the car door and moves

around the side of the house, toward the barn/garage at the

rear.

HE LOOKS CAREFULLY around the area, his eyes searching for

signs of Beynon's men. Nothing seemingly amiss, he moves

toward the front door, tries it, moves away.

Doc crosses to the back screen door of the house. After

another moment, Doc quietly opens the screen door and enters

the house.

INT. HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

DOC MOVES THROUGH THE SERVICE PORCH/PANTRY and into the

kitchen.

INT. KITCHEN - BEYNON - LATE AFTERNOON/NIGHT

BEYNON SITS AT THE LONG KITCHEN TABLE] head on hand, eyes

slightly glared... on the checkered oilcloth in front of him

is a quart bottle of Jim Beam, now half full. He's drinking

the sour mash straight with a water chaser.

DOC LOOKS STEADILY AT BEYNON for a moment,, sets the suitcase

down on the floor, then crosses to the sink, picks up a glass

and sits down at the table. Doc pours himself a drink, takes

a sip.

Except for a faint thickness of speech, Beynon seems quite

sober. Beynon wears a .38 Detective Special C.T.G. in a worn

leather belly holster.

Doc looks at Beynon, notes his gun, then continues stacking

the money.

INT. STATION WAGON

PARKED UNDER THE COTTONWOOD AT THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE. CAROL

SITS CHEWING GUM... LINES OF STRAIN HAVE FORMED ACROSS HER

FACE.

INT. KITCHEN

DOC LISTENS CAREFULLY TO BEYNON.

Beynon smiles and slops three fingers of whiskey into Doc's

glass.

Beynon drinks from his glass. Doc continues counting the

money.

Beynon pauses a moment. Doc looks steadily across the table

into BeynonTs eyes. Prom beyond there might be the quiet

sound of a screen door opening. Beynon gets out of the chair,

stands beside the table.

CONTINUED:

Beynon sips his glass slowly. Doc's hand edges down toward

his waist band.

CONTINUED: (2)

Doc senses a movement from the shadows behind Beynon. Turning

his head slightly, Doc can see Carol standing at the entrance

to the kitchen. She holds a .32 automatic... the pistol seems

to be pointed directly at Doc.

As the gun continues to be pointed directly at Doc.

CAROL FIRES the automatic. The big gun belches the full slip

in a stuttering EXPLOSION... the slide remains back and in an

ejected position.

BEYNON is driven back to the kitchen wall. He SHRIEKS aloud,

the noise strangely like laughter... his body flattens

against the surface, slips downward^ riddled by the big bore

slugs... Doc stands momentarily frozen against the overturned

table. He looks up from Beynon's crumpled body. Carol takes

two steps forward, then drops the automatic, sending it

clattering and spinning away across the floor.

DOC looks at Carol, their eyes find each other. He turns,

moves to the sink, splashes water across his face, then fills

a glass of water from the tap ... drinks it; he looks back at

her.

CAROL stands watching Doc, tears scream down her cheeks.

DOC crosses to Carol, takes her arm, picks up the gun, spent

shells and the suitcase, then leads her out of the kitchen

toward the back door. Beynon's body has slipped from sight,

only a few traces of blood show along the white wall.

INT. PANEL TRUCK - DUSK

Rudy is driving along an open highway. Rudy mouths inane

lyrics to the radio, one arm on the wheel, the other

clutching his wound. A small sign near a mailbox catches

Rudy's eye. He swings the panel truck around in a U-turn,

then pulls into the long dirt driveway of an isolated farm

house.

THE SIGN READS

HAROLD CLINTON, D.V.M.

Practice of Veterinary Medicine.

EXT. DESERTED HIGHWAY - DUSK

THE STATION WAGON IS PARKED ALONG THE CEMENT ROAD, standing

in isolation against the vast Texas b.g.

Doc stands away from the car, his back turned to it ...

gazing at the horizon.

Carol is in the wagon but the passenger side door is open,

her legs dangle outside the car as she looks steadily at the

ground. Doc suddenly turns, walks to her and gives her a

stinging slap across the face.

Tears begin to roll down Carol's face.

CONTINUED:

INT. BEYNON'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Swain sleeps on the davenport. Cully and Hayhoe sit at two

sides of Beynon's large desk, playing a game of checkers...

Hayhoe seems to have Cully badly beaten ... The Accountant

enters the room. The block on the wall shows eight o'clock

straight up.

The two men abandon their game. Cully kicks the sofa,

awakening Swain. He groggily gets to his feet.

INT. MULTI-STORIED AUTO PARK - SAN ANTONIO - DAY

The station wagon enters the building. Doc takes a bright

orange ticket from an ATTENDANT behind a glass window, then

accelerates the wagon up a rampway leading to the upper

levels of the building.

THE STATION WAGON'S TIRES

WHINE through a sweeping turn within the auto park's

uppermost level -- through the building's portals the bright

morning sun can be seen reflecting off the city's rooftops.

CONTINUED:

DOC PULLS THE WAGON to an abrupt halt within a parking stall -

- at an isolated area. He steps out onto the concrete

flooring, slams the door shut.

Doc turns away from the car. As he approaches the elevator,

Doc tears the orange auto park stub into fragments and drops

them into a trash bin without missing a stride.

INT. TRAIN STATION - MORNING

CAROL IS STANDING IN A TICKET LINE THAT MOVES slowly foward.

She struggles, clutching the heavy, money laden suitcase and

her oversize purse between both arms. The line of ticket

buyers moves forward .just fast enough to make it impractical

to set the suitcase down. The station is ancient, vaultlike.

Baggage lockers line the perimeter of the lobby and extend

off into clumped rows within the wings of the station.

CAROL APPROACHES THE TICKET WINDOW. She places the suitcase

flush against the base of the counter and holds it tightly in

place with one leg. Carol pops open her purse... a clumsy

item in itself... as she lifts her wallet and the elderly

ticket-seller looks across to her.

Carol pays the tariff, places the tickets into her purse

along with the change. Wearily, she labors the satchel back

into her hand, then turns and begins to slowly walk down the

seemingly acres-wide station promenade.

NEAR A PORTICO WITHIN THE MAIN LOBBY, Carol sits

uncomfortably on a shiny wooden bench -- the suitcase rests

on the floor pressed tightly between her ankles. She glances

across the promenade walls, her eyes finding:

A CLOCK READING: 9:40

ON A LOBBY BENCH - LATER

CAROL STARES ACROSS THE ROOM at the scattering of passengers

waiting on the wooden seats opposite from her.

Carol's nervous boredom increases; she looks down at her lap,

pretends to find something wrong with her nails and begins

rubbing the cuticles. Carol finally rises impulsively from

the bench, immediately reaching for the brown leather

satchel.

CONTINUED:

CAROL WALKS BACK DOWN THE PROMENADE while carrying   the

suitcase. As other baggage-laden passengers scurry   around

her, she looks across the arcade, her eyes finding   a glass-

walled Cocktail Lounge. She hesitates, then begins   to trudge

in that direction.

A BANK OF LOCKERS STANDS NEAR THE COCKTAIL LOUNGE. As Carol

approaches, an elderly WOMAN deposits a coin in one of the

numbered lockers, opens the metal door and places a small

suitcase inside. Closing and re-locking the door, the Woman

quickly moves away. Having noted the woman and more than

tired of hauling her burden around the station, Carol steps

to the end locker, takes a quarter out of her purse, then

studies the time scarred operating instructions on the face

of the locker. She slips the quarter into the slot and opens

the locker door. As Carol bends to pick up the suitcase, the

locker door swings closed... She tries to open it but the

door has re-locked itself... Carol quite disgusted with her

predicament, again sets the suitcase down and pulls a quarter

out of her change purse. As she again reads the numbered

directions, a YOUNG MAN appears at her shoulder.

THE MAN IS A PROTOTYPE OF URBAN SLEAZINESS, Doberman Pinscher

features are broken by a weedybrown moustache, a cheap

corduroy suit is set off by an oddly matched bow tie. The

Man's appearance suggests a kind of drug store dapperness.

She turns, startled by his sudden proximity. In one smooth

movement the Dapper Man plucks the quarter from Carol's hand,

deposits it in the slot and swings the locker door open.

Setting the heavy suitcase inside, he closes the door, tests

it to show that it

has been re-locked, then removes the key from the lock and

puts it into Carol's hand. She is intimidated momentarily by

the Man's sudden appearance and forcefulness, as well as his

intentions.

Stepping backward, his canine features disappear into a

welter of station activity. Carol watches his receding figure

for a moment, then simultaneously placing the key into her

purse, she turns and begins moving towards the Cocktail

Lounge.

INT. BARN - DAY

EMPTY CAGES STACKED ALONG A WOODEN WALL

A YOUNG KITTEN IN A CARDBOARD BOX wrestling with the barrel

of a .44. A thick veined hand gently rubs the gun over the

fur along the cat's neck and backbone.

RUDY BUTLER IS PREOCCUPIED WITH THE CAT, giving little

attention to the thirtyish Man standing nearby.

HAROLD CLINTON puts away a large syringe then snaps shut the

medical bag. Rudy lies across a cot in one corner of the barn-

like Animal Hospital. The large room is lined with stalls,

cages and pens, many of them vacant.

The wonded criminal is bare-chested. A plaster cast has been

attached to his left arm and shoulder.

FRAN CLINTON SITS ON A HIGH WOODEN STOOL opposite   Rudy. Five

years younger than her husband, tight sweater and   skirt,

bright scarlet fingernail polish, well-built, her   face

suggests sensuality. Fran's bare, milk-white legs   are crossed

under her rumpled skirt.

CONTINUED:

Rudy smiles at Mrs. Clinton. He's never met Fran before, but

he's known her for years.

Rudy looks back down at the gun and cat. The following

silence is like a scream. Finally:

He points the gun at Mrs. Clinton.

A long pause.

CONTINUED: (2)

INT. TRAINS STATION BAR - DAY

Carol sits in the bar. A young SOLDIER approaches and sits

down at the counter next to her. She is finishing a vodka

gimlet.

Carol glances at her watch.

The soldier's beer arrives.

CONTINUED:

Carol pushes aside her glass.

Carol smiles at the soldier. Her features suddenly freeze as

she glances toward the entrance to the bar.

AT THE DOORWAY

DOC STANDS LOOKING AT CAROL and the soldier.

Carol moves towards the exit.

The soldier quietly sips his beer, his face a bit grim.

AT THE DOORWAY

CAROL STOPS NEAR DOC.

They look at each other...

Carol continues looking at Doc for a moment.

Then, suddenly moves past him, leading him out into the main

lobby.

SERIES OF ANGLES

CAROL EMERGES FROM THE COCKTAIL LOUNGE followed by Doc.

They cross to the lockers.

She retrieves the key from her purse and thrusts it into the

proper slot. It doesn't turn. Puzzled she tries again, then

forcing the key, shakes the lock violently.

Her eyes widening into a quiet panic, she next looks at the

locker number and then the number on the key. Her features

are now totally ashen.

She walks up the bank of lockers... puts the key in another

locker, the door opens, the compartment is empty.

Carol turns away from the locker, eyes glazed with fear...

Doc at her shoulder.

Carol winces, containing her anger.

CONTINUED:

Carol nods.

As Doc pushes Carol forward.

Walking at a rapid pace, they start through the station, Doc

forcing their speed, clutching Carol under her elbow. They

reach the main concourse after moving down the length of the

promenade... eyes straining.

CAROL STOPS SUDDENLY. SHE STARES DOWN THE LONG CORRIDOR her

eyes finding the thief. He stands near another bank of

lockers, the black suitcase at his feet.

THE THIEF LOOKS UP AT CAROL - virtually within the same

moment that she spots him. His expression never changes. He

takes a step towards her, smiling... Then, with a movement

that is both abrupt and casual, he snatches up the money bag

and disappears behind the constant traffic of train patrons.

DOC HAS SEEN THE THIEF. Recognizing the suitcase he moves

immediately after him. Carol follows Doc but is unable to

keep up. She watches as Doc vanishes behind the row of

lockers.

CAROL ROUNDS THE LAST LOCKER IN THE ROW but both men have now

disappeared from view. She sags back against the edge of the

metal compartments, exhausted, fearful.

CONTINUED: (2)

Carol again raises her eyes. Still breathless, her face glows

with moisture.

INT. THE CLINTON'S BARN - (MORNING)

FRAN IS STILL SEATED ON THE STOOL. Rudy stares at her from

the cot. Harold is now absent.

Rudy continues looking at her.

He gestures with his gun. Fran crosses the distance slowly,

moving with apprehension.

Rudy gestures her closer...

CONTINUED:

Fran smiles. She is now standing over the cot, looking

directly down at Rudy. He jerks her down.

Rudy smiles.

INT. TRAIN STATION - A SERIES OF ANGLES - DAY

DOC MOVING LIKE A GUN DOG ON THE HUNT between the rows of

lockers; catching sight of the thief momentarily, he closes

in.

After a series of criss-crossed movements among the banked

locker corriders, Doc again loses sight of the thief as the

slender criminal dodges off onto a main passenger concourse.

Doc is faster and more agile than the thief, but the station

is unfamiliar territory to him. Both Doc and the Thief move

carefully, they must not arouse enough attention to make

themselves conspicuous, thus risking police interference.

THE THIEF HURRIES ALONG THE MAIN CONCOURSE weaving between

the incoming and departing passengers that dot the long

corridor.

DOC IN PURSUIT DOWN THE CONCOURSE, he passes several sealed

off departure/arrival gates.

THE THIEF STEPS OFF THE CONCOURSE INTO GATE THREE, an open

stairway winding downward.

DOC FOLLOWS HIS QUARRY DOWN THE STAIRWAY to the train area

where he immediately skips over the winding ramp and onto the

loading platform. Emerging from the short tunnel, Doc isn't

surprised that the Thief is again nowhere in sight. Doc steps

behind a pillar -- he waits watchfully... After a moment or

two, the Thief edges out from behind another column and

starts back up the platform towards the concourse.

CONTINUED:

Doc moves quickly to intercept his opponent but, as the Thief

spots his approach, he turns and Joins several passengers

scurrying toward the awaiting train...

THE FLYER STANDS GLEAMING AT TRACKSIDE, perpendicular to the

boarding gate. Two doors to the train stand open, one in the

pullman section, the other entrance admitting day coach

passengers.

CAROL - ON THE MAIN CONCOURSE - MOVING ALONG WITH THE FLOW of

about-to-depart passengers... the Flyer comes into sight,

visible on the next level below.

THE CONDUCTOR - AT TRACKSIDE - STANDS SMILING BROADLY by the

coach entrance. He grins at the boarding PASSENGERS as he

speaks to a nearby BRAKEMAN. The Thief skirts around a

baggage-laden elderly COUPLE and moves up the two-step and

into the rail car passageway.

DOC MOVING QUICKLY AGAIN. He sees the Thief slip past the

conductor and into the train.

THE THIEF IS NOW INSIDE THE DAY COACH. He heads toward the

forward compartments.

DOC EXPERTLY SQUIRMS THROUGH THE BOARDING THRONG and

disappears past the conductor up into the passenger car

vestibule.

ON THE CONCOURSE

CAROL WATCHES AS A BLONDISH MAN in a grey suit skips aboard

the Flyer standing below. She is unable to get a clear look

at the man, and is unsure as to whether or not it was Doc.

She hesitates, then moves forward to Gate Three which will

take her down to trackside...

Carol stands at the edge of the gate -- the last of the crowd

having already passed through. She hesitates again, staring

down at the shining train.

INT. FLYER - DAY COACH

THE AISLE IS CLOGGED WITH PASSENGERS. People hesitate over

their selection of seats, put baggage into overhead racks,

clumsily remove their overcoats... The Thief continues to

move forward, squirming around the passengers at a hurried

but controlled pace.

AT THE END OF A PULLMAN

DOC ENTERS, THREADING HIS WAY FORWARD, scanning faces. He is

one car behind the Thief and losing ground, due to the fact

that Doc must carefully note the occupants of each seat as he

passes. Doc is further delayed by a WOMAN blocking the aisle.

She struggles painfully, trying to fit a suitcase into an

overhead carriage.

Doc, with the most forced of smiles, reaches up to help her.

30? THE THIEF MOVES THROUGH ANOTHER VESTIBULE and into an 30?

empty car -- now unobserved, he immediately breaks into a

run.

DOC LOOKING, MOVING NIMBLY INTO ANOTHER VESTIBULE AND CAR.

The passengers have become fewer and fewer as he nears the

front of the train.

THE THIEF RUNS THROUGH ANOTHER VESTIBULE AND INTO A SMOKER.

This car also deserted, he maintains his trotting pace,

swinging the heavy suitcase as he goes... reaching the end of

the smoker, he enters the next vestibule and attempts to move

into the following car, but the Thief is brought to a halt by

the sudden dead end of the passageway. The next car holds

only baggage. He has reached furthest forward passenger car.

The Thief desperately tries to open the vestibule door,

hoping to escape by jumping off the train, but the doors are

tightly locked. He begins to retrace his steps.

DOC MOVES CAREFULLY INTO THE NEXT CAR FORWARD, still

unknowingly two cars behind the Thief.

THE THIEF PASSES BACK TO THE VESTIBULE AT THE REAR OF THE

SMOKER, his eye suddenly catching the Men's Lounge. He tries

the door -- locked. The Thief snaps out a pen knife, picks

the lock with a deft movement. Passengers are visible behind

him as he works, filtering into the pullman car following the

smoker. None of them notes his activity. The restroom door

swings open.

INT. MEN'S LOUNGE

The Thief immediately snaps the bolt-lock shut behind him,

crosses the small, murky room and tries to lift the window.

He strains mightily but the glass remains hopelessly

jammed...

DOC ENTERS THE FINAL PASSENGER CAR, notes the half 313 dozen

travelers and continues moving forward, going next into the

smoker.

CONTINUED:

THE SMOKING CAR IS EMPTY, although several Passengers and a

PORTER enter it moments after Doc leads the way. Doc passes

through the length of the car, moves into the vestibule and,

like the Thief a few moments before, finds his passage

blocked by the baggage car. Doc hesitates, then turns and

begins going back in the opposite direction.

DOC STOPS AT THE MEN'S LOUNGE -- staring hard at the door for

a moment. He tries the handle. The door remains firmly shut.

Doc nods and moves away, continuing to retrace his steps

toward his point of entrance onto the train.

THE THIEF, HAVING ABANDONED THE JAMMED WINDOW, is now undoing

the snaps and straps holding the suitcase closed. The lid

pulls upward and stacks of money appear under his hands. The

Thief grabs a money pad, runs his thumb over it, then shoves

the stack of greenbacks into his coat's inside breast pocket.

DOC MOVES WITH DETERMINATION back through the passenger cars.

INT. MEN'S LOUNGE

THE THIEF HAS AGAIN CLOSED THE SUITCASE. He nervously looks

about his tight-walled sanctuary, then crosses back to the

window and stares out through a corner of the pane. He pulls

the shade lower.

EXT. TRACK

METAL WHEELS GRIND AGAINST THE RAILS, the train SHUDDERS,

then begins to move forward.

THE THIEF IS WATCHING THROUGH THE MEN'S ROOM WINDOW as the

train edges forward. His body suddenly tightens. He sees Doc

outside the train, walking slowly between a narrow passage of

moving passenger cars and several parked tinders.

THE THIEF ALLOWS HIMSELF A QUICK SMILE. Turning away from the

window he picks up the suitcase, unbolts the lock and steps

back out into the vestibule.

CONTINUED:

AT THE BACK OF THE SMOKER, the Thief seats himself next to a

window and places the suitcase on the cushioned chair

opposite from him. In the forward position of the car, well

behind the Thief's back, a dozen Passengers are scattered

about the lounge chairs. A Conductor appears at the end of

the smoker opposite the Thief and begins to collect and punch

tickets.

As the train begins to pick up speed, the Thief lifts an

abandoned copy of the newpaper off the cushion next to him.

He glances at the front page, then unfolds the width of the

paper. As a precaution against regaining poverty, the Thief

rests one foot against the suitcase. All seems secure. Then,

Doc sits down next to the Thief.

DOC COMPANIONABLY SLIDES AN ARM BEHIND THE BACK OP THE

THIEF'S NECK, pulling him close.

The Thief's knife instantly flashes into his hand, but before

he can bring it into play, Doc catches his arms.

THE KNIFE IS TIGHTLY WEDGED INTO THE THIEF'S HAND. Doc's

fingers are vise-like at his wrist.

THE OTHER PASSENGERS REMAIN PRE-OCCUPIED AT THE OTHER end of

the car, taking no note of the quiet encounter.

THE CONDUCTOR IS STILL AT THE OPPOSITE END OF THE CAR from

Doc and the Thief. He continues collecting and punching

fares.

INT. STATION GATE - DAY

CAROL IS EXITING. THERE IS AN ANNOUNCEMENT OVER THE

LOUDSPEAKER -- the train has left.

INT. TRAIN - DAY

THE CONDUCTOR AS SEEN BY THE THIEF'S WIDENING EYES. He

methodically punches the tickets, never looking more than two

seats ahead.

THE THIEF'S EYES BULGE AS DOC CHOPS HIM ON THE WINDPIPE. The

Thief goes out. Is he dead?

DOC CHOPS HIM AGAIN. IF HE ISN'T DEAD HE LOOKS IT.

Doc pulls the Thief's hat down over his head.

INT. STATION - DAY

CAROL CROSSES INTO THE STATION, TAKES A DEEP BREATH.

Sits... waiting. The soldier comes by, stops. She doesn't

recognize anything.

INT. TRAIN - DAY

THE CONDUCTOR ARRIVES AT THE LOUNGE CHAIRS WHERE DOC AND THE

thief are seated. He stops in the aisleway, expectantly

leaning in Doc's direction.

As Doc takes out his wallet, peels a fifty out and gives it

to him.

The conductor cuts the fare receipt and begins to make

change.

THE THIEF SITS FACING THE WINDOW LOOKING VERY DEAD

INT. CLINTON'S FORD - DAY

RUDY SITS IN THE BACK SEAT AS HAROLD CAUTIOUSLY MOTORS

DOWN the highway. With his one good arm, Rudy cares for the

kitten resting in the cardboard box on the back seat.

Harold works his jaw, his grip tightens on the wheel.

INT. KITCHEN - BEYNON'S RANCH - DAY

BEYNON'S BODY REMAINS OUT OF SIGHT behind the overturned

kitchen table... a small trickle of blood oozes out from

under one of the table legs.

The Accountant stands with Cully, Hayhoe and Swain staring

down at Beynon's body.

INT. PULLMAN CAR - DAY

AS DOC THUMBS IDLY THROUGH THE NEWSPAPER. He is suddenly

showered with spurting water. He lowers the paper and looks

to the aisle, seeing:

A SEVEN YEAR OLD BLACK PANTHER, dressed appropriately and

holding a water pistol.

Doc looks at the brat.

CONTINUED:

He squeezes the pistol's trigger, two bursts of water land on

Doc's shirt front. Doc continues staring at the boy. The kid

looks hard at Doc, not giving an inch.

Doc takes the boy's arm, gently pulls him closer.

Now you better get back to her real quick or I'm going to

break your little arm... okay?

Doc releases the boy. The kid looks at Doc for a moment then

bursts into tears and retreats at a dead run back down the

passenger car aisleway. Doc again lifts the paper, turning to

the sports page.

INT. STATION - DAY

CAROL WAITS IN THE STATION. (A SERIES OP ANGLES AND

DISSOLVES)

INT. PULLMAN - DAY

DOC LIFTS THE SUITCASE AS THE CONDUCTOR APPEARS at the

vestibule at the opposite end of the car and announces the

next stop. Doc prepares to get off. The passenger car remains

sparsely populated. No one occupies the seats near the

corpse.

EXT. FIRST TRAIN CONCOURSE - SERIES OF ANGLES AND DISSOLVES -

EARLY MORNING

CAROL SITS WATCHING THE PEOPLE -- she gets up, doesn't know

where to go... sits down again... fear and anticipation on

her face... stands up... ready to go where? Ready to sit down

again, she looks up.

DOC CROSSES SLOWLY TO HER CARRYING THE SUITCASE. Carol

reacts... pleased to see him... pleased that he's back...

until.

CONTINUED:

Doc is silent. After a long pause.

A long pause. Maybe she wonders; what if he is lying but what

if he isn't? Temptation? She makes up her mind.

INT. PASSENGER TRAIN - EARLY EVENING

DOC AND CAROL WATCH THROUGH THE DOUBLE WINDOWS AS THE train

yard lights of a town go strobing by.

EXT. SECOND TRAIN CONCOURSE.

DOC AND CAROL COME DOWN OUT OF THE GANGWAY OF ANOTHER train

and turn up the pavement toward the main part of the depot.

Doc continues holding the suitcase as they walk.

To the cops a description's only good if there's a channel

for it, and there's no connection between that stiff and the

robbery.

But Doc doesn't answer.

INT. TRANSIT HOTEL - NIGHT

DOC LIES NEXT TO CAROL. Carol is eating a hamburger wrapped

in wax paper. She passes one over to Doc along with some

greasy french fries and a couple of napkins .

The Suitcase has been placed on the small writing desk across

the room. Doc silently munches his hamburger.

CONTINUED:

Doc glances at the poster rolled up. Carol hasn't put it up

on the wall yet.

INT. FIRST TRAIN - NIGHT

THE TRAIN GOES CLICKETY CLICK THROUGH THE NIGHT, the young

panther is stalking and prowling among the sleeping

passengers. His Mother catches him, takes him back to his

seat.

INT. TRANSIT HOTEL - NIGHT

CAROL IS BUSY UNBANDING THE MONEY PADS. A LARGE STACK OF

discarded wrappers have been placed in a metal trash can near

her leg. Behind her, Doc, now in his undershirt, reads a

Texas newspaper.

CAROL CONTINUES TO LOOSEN THE GREENBACKS. She is surrounded

on the double bed by stacks of money. She lights a match,

drops it into the wastebasket. The money bands quickly burst

into flames, consume themselves, then die back into crinkly

ashes.

He continues thinking. Carol watches him for a moment.

Doc looks across at her.

Doc looks at her.

CONTINUED:

Rudy knew about Laughlins.

I think he got to you.

INT. FIRST TRAIN - NIGHT

A WATER PISTOL APPEARS AROUND THE CORNER   OF AN EMPTY

PASSENGER CHAIR. The seven year old brat   squeezes off several

plumes of water. The Thief is hit by the   gun's spray, water

runs slowly down his ear and the back of   his neck.

THE BOY WATCHES THE IMMOBILE MAN. He fires again, once again

there is no reaction. The brat steps forward... smiling, he

pushes the thief's arm, pushes harder.

THE THIEF'S BODY SUDDENLY FALLS BACK ACROSS THE CHAIR. His

eyes roll upward... staring at the panther. His neck is

bruised, he pushes his hat back slowly.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

CAROL SLEEPS ON HER STOMACH, her head resting across one arm.

Doc lies beside her, eyes open. He looks over at Carol a

moment, noting the long strands of hair that move

rhythmically back and forth from her gentle breathing. After

a moment Doc quietly stands, moves to the writing table and

stares at the black suitcase.

CONTINUED:

He opens the valise and lifts the large stack of greenbacks

into a shaft of light coming through a crack in the drawn

shade. Still holding the money, Doc looks back at Carol.

ONE LAST TIGHTLY BOUND MONEY PAD - NIGHT

Printed clearly on the brown wrapper.

FIRST BANK OF BEACON CITY

BEACON CITY

COMMONWEALTH OF TEXAS

INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

A PLAINCLOTHES OFFICER HOLDS A SIMILAR MONEY PAD with his

handkerchief. The Panther is sitting with his mother on a

nearby seat. Still dressed in his panther suit, but no longer

a brat. His face reflects both fear and shock.

THE THIEF IS WITH THEM, BANDAGED AROUND THE THROAT

INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

CAROL COMES IN. SHE IS WEARING A NEW SUIT, SANDALS It looks

great... She tosses a package on the bed.

Doc looks at her outfit and opens his. They are too flashy.

They could pick you up for soliciting in ten minutes.

CONTINUED:

Doc throws his clothes away.

Carol suddenly angered slaps him.

Doc immediately delivers her a stinging blow.

Carol hits the wall then stands stunned as he quietly ties

his laces and pulls on his jacket. Doc stuffs the Colt .45

into the flapped outside pocket along with 2 clips. He turns

to the bed and picks up the suitcase.

Carol continues looking at Doc.

Carol starts to speak.

Doc doesn't answer. He turns and exits. She follows.

INT. POLICE STATION - MORNING

THE CONDUCTOR, THE THIEF AND THE PANTHER STUDY THREE TELEX

PICTURES OF MEN LOOKING SOMETHING LIKE DOC.

Printed at one side of the photographs are their criminal

records.

THE SENIOR DETECTIVE AND THE TWO PLAINCLOTHES

RUDY REACHES OVER TO THE NIGHTSTAND AND SHUTS OFF the radio.

His eyes stare vacantly ahead for a moment.

HAROLD CLINTON IS TIED SECURELY INTO A CHAIR, his mouth

tightly gagged.

RUDY BEGINS TO SMILE. FRAN IS NEXT TO RUDY WITHIN THE bed,

wearing only a bra, sleeping, one arm wrapped around Rudy's

middle.

CONTINUED:

Rudy continues smiling. He pulls the sheet away from Frank,

then allows his hand to reach down, cupping her breast from

inside the bra. Fran half awakens, pulls herself closer to

Rudy.

INT. LAUGHLIN HOTEL - EL PASO - MORNING

CANNON (one of the Accountant's boys, whom we have not seen

before) ENTERS THE DARK NEARLY DESERTED LOBBY and approaches

the reception desk. The large room is populated by

overstuffed and threadbare furniture.

LAUGHLIN looks very much like Dub Taylor and speaks Spanish

just about as badly. He flashes a quick grin from behind the

counter as Cannon draws near. At the switchboard behind

Laughlin, CARMEN, maybe 35, sits next to the telephone jacks

(all of them idle) readinc a movie magazine.

Laughlin indicates a seventeen year old BELLBOY sleeping in

one of the overstuffed chairs.

INT. DOC AND CAROL'S CAR - DAY

AS IT MOTORS DOWN THE TEXAS HIGHWAY. The black suitcase is

propped up between Doc and Carol in the front seat. Doc,

seated on the passenger side, bangs the car radio with his

hand. The radio is obviously not working as he turns the

dials and pushes the buttons.

We hear garbled words for a moment, pleasing Doc... and then

the radio conks out again. This time Doc hits the radio hard.

When it is clear that the radio won't work:

DOC SLAMS THE BRAKE, GRABS THE WHEEL as the car veers over to

the side of the road.

She starts the car up again, and continues driving, her

knuckles tightening around the steering wheel.

INT. CLINTON'S FORD - ANGLES - DAY

AS IT LEISURELY MOVES ALONG THE ROADWAY BORDERED BY MILES OF

SAGEBRUSH. Harold drives, Fran is again in the front seat

beside her husband... a scrunched up sack of food beside her.

She wipes her mouth with a napkin, shoves it inside the paper

bag, then turns to watch the passing scenery. Rudy sits in

the back, eating spareribs. He suddenly throws a just

finished bone at Fran, hitting her on the shoulder.

He throws another sparerib at Fran.

God damn it, Rudy, what did you do that for? Jesus.

He laughs and again throws another bone at Fran. She suddenly

catches his mood and begins laughing herself ... tossing a

bone back at Rudy.

HAROLD CONTINUES DRIVING. His knuckles whiten around the

steering wheel as a sparerib bounces off the window in front

of him.

THE KITTEN IS SLEEPING WITHIN the cardboard box, oblivious to

Rudy and Fran's laughter. (That will be the day.)

EXT. SMALL TEXAS TOWN - DAY

THE CHEVY MOVES ALONG with the light mid-day traffic, passing

various roadside business establishments, then pulls up

before a radio/TV repair and sales shop.

INT. RADIO/TV STORE - DAY

ALL THE LATEST MODEL RADIOS are stacked on shelves around the

small room... a television display featuring several models

is in one corner of the shop. Another TV is playing near the

counter and the PROPRIETOR'S desk.

CONTINUED:

The Proprietor moves to a shelf.

THE SCREEN. As Doc's picture suddenly flashes onto the tube,

with appropriate dialogue.

DOC STARING AT THE TELEVISION, then he quickly reaches over

and snaps the set off.

THE PROPRIETOR BRINGS OUT SOME RADIOS, seemingly oblivious to

Doc's action.

DOC TURNS, then looks at the corner of the small shop.

ALL THE TELEVISION SETS have Doc's picture on them.

DOC TURNS BACK TO THE PROPRIETOR -- the man is looking at him

not at the sets.

Taking a set, he exits.

But he doesn't answer.

INT. CAR - DAY

CAROL TURNS AS DOC STICKS HIS HEAD through the open door,

hands her the set.

DOC AND CAROL WALKING UP THE SIDEWALK OP THE SMALL TOWN. They

turn into a Sporting Goods Store. The Chevy is behind them, a

block away.

INT. RADIO/TV STORE

THE PROPRIETOR LOOKS CAREFULLY OUT THE WINDOW AT THE empty

car, then turns and grabs his telephone.

INT. SPORTING GOODS STORE

CAROL REMAINS BY THE FRONT WINDOW, PRETENDING TO

EXAMINE some fishing equipment as she keeps her eye on the

street.

Doc moves to the counter at the rear of the store. An

ATTENDANT moves up to help Doc.

The Salesman puts a form in front of Doc then goes to the gun

rack behind him, lifts off a short-barreled shotgun and

begins to wrap it.

CAROL, AT THE FRONT OP THE STORE, WATCHES THE STREET INTENTLY

EXT. THE STREET

THE RADIO-REPAIRMAN EXITS THE SHOP AS A POLICE CAR comes down

the street and makes a U-turn... stopping near the Chevy.

After a brief conversation the Radio-Repairman goes back

inside his store and the police car pulls forward, down the

street from the Chevy.

INT. POLICE CAR

THE TWO COPS LOOK LIKE HOMER AND JETHRO. Both men stare hard

at the now staked-out Chevy.

CAROL -- WATCHING PROM THE WINDOW OP THE SPORTING GOODS STORE

AT THE COUNTER THE SALESMAN LAYS OUT THE GUN AND THE BOXES OF

SHELLS. As Doc empties the loose shells into his coat pocket:

CAROL TURNS, LOOKS AT DOC, THEIR EYES MEET. Doc reads her; he

knows that the police are in the street.

AT THE COUNTER THE SALESMAN PUTS A STRING AROUND THE BROWN

PAPER

Doc quickly pays the man.

Doc turns as the Salesman drifts over to another Customer --

he approaches Carol at the store window.

Carol moves ahead of Doc,, exits the Sporting Goods Store and

starts up the sidewalk.

DOC WATCHES HER FOR A MOMENT, THEN HEADS FOR THE DOOR HIMSELF

EXT. SIDEWALK

CAROL WALKS ALONE BACK TOWARDS THE CAR.

INT. POLICE CAR

HOMER AND JETHRO CONTINUE STARING AT THE CHEW. Their car is

pointed towards the Radio Store, its back to the Sporting

Goods house.

DOC LEAVES THE SPORTING GOODS STORE, CROSSES THE STREET and

begins walking up the opposite sidewalk, back towards the

Chevy.

CAROL PASSES THE POLICE CAR AND NEARS THE CHEVY

INT. POLICE CAR

THE TWO RURAL COPS MOVE INTO ACTION; their car pulls forward

and parks diagonally across the street, partially blocking

the roadway as xvell as nearly obstructing the Chevy.

CAROL STANDS FROZEN AS HOMER AND JETHRO HOP OUT OF THE POLICE

car, guns drawn.

DOC CROSSES THE STREET BEHIND THE COP CAR

HE LEVELS HIS big gun...

Doc FIRES the shotgun through the "brown wrapping paper point

blank into the squad car, caving in one side of the machine

and blasting the radiator into a steaming wreck.

Homer and Jethro hit the ground, paralyzed with fright as

their car EXPLODES behind them.

With three more BLASTS Doc blows most of the top off the

police car then calmly reloads.

The two cops send their guns clattering across the pavement.

CAROL HAS INSTANTLY MOVED BACK INTO THE CHEVY, started the

engine and begun maneuvering it out onto the street. She

makes a U-turn, then pulls up near Doc.

DOC STEPS FORWARD, KICKS THE TWO PISTOLS BACK UNDER the

police car near the gas tank.

He walks to the back of the car.

Carol throws open the passenger door of the Chevy.

Doc SHOOTS the gas tank of the squad car, it instantly

ignites.

Walking calmly around the burning police car Doc then starts

to climb into the Chevy.

Carol REVS the engine.

Doc pauses a moment, looking back at the prone police

officers and the blazing automobile.

CONTINUED:

Carol guns the car forward -- Doc, unprepared for the Chevy's

sudden movement, falls flat on his face across the pavement.

CAROL THROWS THE CHEVY INTO REVERSE, AND ROARS back to pick

up Doc.

DOC, A LITTLE CHAGRINED, PICKS HIMSELF UP, GRABS his gun and

jumps into the Chevy. He slams the door closed, Carol again

tears forward -- tires peeling down the pavement.

HOMER AND JETHRO RAISE THEMSELVES. With very long faces they

study the burning remains of their once proud squad car.

EXT. HIGHWAY

THE CHEVY SPEEDS OUT OF TOWN,, onto an open stretch of road.

INT. CHEVY

DOC JAMS ONE MORE SHELL INTO HIS PAPER-WRAPPED gun -- Carol

grips the wheel tightly concentrating on the road... the

Chevy continues to accelerate.

EXT. HIGHWAY

THE CHEVY CROSSES THE ROAD'S BROKEN WHITE LINE and passes a

lumbering Greyhound bus.

DOC, STARING AT THE HIGHWAY BEHIND THEM; the bus fades off

into the horizon...

THE CHEVY PULLS OFF THE HIGHWAY, MOVES UP A DIRT road for

twenty yards then pulls into a cornfield of a well laid out

farm, smashing through the six foot high stalks. Well out of

sight, the Chevy slams to an abrupt halt.

DOC AND CAROL, RUNNING THROUGH THE CORNFIELD AND BACK UP THE

DIRT road toward the highway. Doc still carries his gun in

the brown wrapping paper. Carol labors with the suitcase as

she runs.

ON THE HIGHWAY DOC STANDS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD, waving

both arms overhead. The Greyhound bus comes to a lurching

halt, Doc and Carol scramble aboard.

INT. BUS

DOC BUYS TWO FARES FROM THE SCOWLING GREYHOUND DRIVER. The

bus again moves forward.

CONTINUED:

DOC AND CAROL SITTING TOGETHER ON THE BUS, Doc hold- 4l4 ing

his camouflaged gun. They lean back on their padded seats as

the bus jostles along the road.

Suddenly... Two Police Cars pass the bus, SIRENS screaming,

lights turning...

Doc and Carol's eyes meet...

One more Black and White passes the bus and races on down the

road.

EXT. TEXAS TOWN - AFTERNOON 4L

DOC WEARS A SUNBEATEN LEATHER JACKET, READING A NEWSPAPER,

while leaning against a hot dog stand. One foot rests on the

of Doc.

A GREY MERCURY PULLS UP NEAR THE DOGGIE DINER. Carol is

driving. Doc walks up to the window of the car.

drive-in restaurant.

THE MERCURY COMES TO A STOP WITHIN A ROW OF CARS FACING the

indoor portion of the restaurant.

DOC AND CAROL - INSIDE THEIR AUTOMOBILE AS THE CAR HOP - a

skinny girl, wearing a brown jacket and slacks, approaches

the car carrying two menus. She arrives with a smile. Doc

leans forward, looking past Carol at the waitress, he lifts

his hand, not accepting the bill of fare.

The Car Hop walks back across the raised cement sidewalk

towards the kitchen area...

INT. MOTEL - NIGHT

HAROLD IS TIED TO A CHAIR, RUDY IS LYING ON THE BED, half-

clothed, eating chicken, drinking a beer, while Fran slowly

strips down to bra and panties.

INT. MERCURY AT THE DRIVE-IN RESTAURANT

serving tray onto the car-door window.

CONTINUED:

The girl clamps the tray to the window. The Car Hop narrows

her features, looking at Doc and Carol then smiles and turns

and heads back toward the kitchen.

DOC REACHES UP AND CASUALLY ADJUSTS THE REAR VIEW MIRROR

THE MIRROR HAS BEEN TURNED TO REVEAL THE HIGHWAY AND THE

ENTRANCE TO THE DRIVE-IN'S PARKING LOT

CAROL BEGINS TO EAT, she looks casually at the mirror.

DOC SLOWLY EATS HIS CHEESEBURGER, TAKES A SIP OF MILKSHAKE

CAROL REACHES FOR HER COFFEE, spills it and then reaches for

the light switch knob on the dashboard.

THE MERCURY'S HEADLIGHTS BLINK ON

THE CAR HOP AT THE PICK-UP STAND, notes the lights 429 then

turns her head the opposite direction, pretending not to see.

DOC WATCHES THE WAITRESS TURN AWAY

THE CAR HOP STARES AT THE CEMENT PAVEMENT. Within the kitchen

behind her the cooks all look toward the parking lot... their

faces expectant.

DOC WATCHING THE WAITRESS

Carol looks into the rear view mirror. Across the wide lot a

police car appears, cutting in off the highway.

Doc goes into the back seat, Carol kicks the engine over,

jams the stick into gear. All this is accomplished while

staring into the rear view mirror.

DOC LIFTS THE LAUNDRY BAG-COVERED SHOTGUN onto his lap.

THE POLICE CAR cruises slowly along the line of autos...

INT. POLICE CAR

TWO OFFICERS SCAN THE PARKING LOT. THE PASSENGER COP CRADLES

a riot gun.

CONTINUED:

THE SQUAD CAR PULLS TO A STOP FIFTEEN FEET behind the

Mercury, seemingly blocking the way.

CAROL STANDS ON THE ACCELERATOR. THE MERCURY GOES screaming

forward, as Doc shoots out the back window. Then, as the

terrified cops duck to the side, he shoots out their front

windshield. The Mercury bounces up across the sidewalk as the

empty plates and glasses topple off the serving tray and roll

across the concrete. The car slams back down through a vacant

space on the opposite side, and moves around in a semicircle

across the asphalt, heading for the highway exit.

DOC SMASHES OUT THE REAR WINDOW with the butt of his shotgun.

THE BLACK AND WHITE NOW IN REVERSE, ZOOMING BACK, trying to

get between the Mercury and the highway.

CAROL BRINGING THE CAR AROUND, SHE CAN SEE THE SQUAD CAR

streaking backward. She pulls the wheel to the right and

brings her car across the front of the still stopping Police

Car.

THE OFFICERS TRY TO BRING THEIR GUNS INTO PLAY AS THE Mercury

streaks in front of them.

DOC FIRES THE SHOTGUN TWICE

THE POLICE CAR EXPLODES. THE HOOD IS LIFTED OFF THE CAR. Both

Officers jump out of the vehicle, pouring shots after the

retreating Mercury.

CAROL - SCREAMING AS THE FRONT AND BACK WINDSHIELDS SHATTER

around her.

THE MERCURY, BADLY RIDDLED, PULLS OUT ONTO THE HIGHWAY

ANOTHER SQUAD CAR COMES SPEEDING UP in the opposite

direction. The Driver hits the brakes, the tires smoke along

the street as the Black and White SCREAMS to a stop.

CAROL PULLS THE MERCURY BY THE SQUAD CAR

DOC FIRES ANOTHER TWO BURSTS...

THE POLICE CAR - THE FRONT AND BACK FENDERS ARE HIT; the

wheels disintegrate - the impact of the shells rocks the

Black and White upward.

CONTINUED:

THE SECOND PASSENGER COP, FIRING A .38 OUT HIS BACK WINDOW at

the Mercury as it streaks down the road. Three holes open up

on the trunk of the auto.

DOC CAN SEE BOTH OFFICERS JUMP OUT OF THE SECOND Black and

White through the rear window. Carol makes a quick turn off

the highway.

THE MERCURY ROARS DOWN THE DARK STREET INTO THE CITY'S

COMMERCIAL SECTION, suddenly slow, makes another sharp turn -

this time through a red light.

DOWN A SMALLER STREET FILLED WITH SHOPS - CAROL ROUNDS THE

CORNER, whips up to the curb - Doc and Carol jump out of the

car. She carries the suitcase, he hangs onto his big gun.

DOC AND CAROL, MOVING DOWN A DESERTED SIDEWALK; the SOUND of

sirens. They round a corner, then quickly move into an alley.

THE ALLEY IS NARROW, DESERTED. DOC AND CAROL pull back into

an alcove as a prowl car goes SCREAMING down the street and

off into the night. They continue down the alley.

THE OPPOSITE ENTRANCE TO THE ALLEY IS BLOCKED BY a large

metal garbage container, and the DRIVER empties two cans of

garbage into it. Then he starts across the narrow street

beyond in order to grab several others.

DOC LOOKS BEHIND HIM, THEN GRABS CAROL'S ARM. They run for

the container. Doc tosses the suitcase into the container,

jumps in, reaches back, pulls Carol in beside him. SIRENS

again sound close by.

AFTER A MOMENT, A LARGE GARBAGE TRUCK PULLS UP, lifts the

container with hooks and dumps the garbage and Doc and Carol

into the truck.

A SERIES OP ANGLES AS A CRUSHER BEGINS TO MOVE TOWARDS THEM

INSIDE THE TRUCK. Doc and Carol start to panic, but they have

room enough.

WITHIN THE TRUCK DOC WIGGLES HIS .45 out of his jacket and

into his hand. He, Carol and the suitcase are crushed tightly

amongst the garbage. A moment after Doc frees his gun, a load

of garbage descends on their shelter, partially obscuring

them.

THE TRUCK PULLS OUT

DOC AND CAROL SWEATING... BREATHING HARD. Again the SOUND of

sirens... the truck lurches forward.

CONTINUED:

THE TRUCK MOVES ALONG THE EMPTY STREETS, passing several

prowling squad cars.

EXT. STREETS - SERIES OF ANGLES - SUNRISE

THE GARBAGE MAN DRIVING THE TRUCK, MAKING STOPS, throwing in

more refuse. The truck continues along.

DOC AND CAROL - THEIR FACES COVERED WITH PERSPIRATION and

flies... buried within their enclosure under the moist

garbage.

A GARBAGE DUMP - MORNING

THE TRUCK GROWLS ALONG THE RUTTED PATHWAY surrounded by acres

of open trash. Areas within the dump reveal the slow,

smouldering fires...

THE TRUCK BACKS UP TO A HUGE CRATER HALF-FILLED WITH REFUSE

THE DRIVER REVS THE ENGINE, PULLS THE BED LIFT GEAR

THE TRUCK BED RISES AND TILTS FORWARD, as the load of trash

tumbles down the face of the crater.

DOC AND CAROL SLIDE DOWN THE MOUNTAIN OF FILTH, and stumbling

forward they climb into a large cardboard box.

THE DRIVER GETS OUT OF THE CAB, checks to see that the

garbage is gone from the truck bed. On his way back to the

cab he finds a magazine to his liking near a shredded auto

tire. With his newly-found prize, the Driver re-enters the

truck and drives away.

THE BOX LIES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CRATER AMONGST the broken

bottles, melon rinds, flashlight batteries, tin cans, used

tires.

DOC SAWS AT A CORNER OF THE CARDBOARD BOX with his penknife.

The matted paper gives away, allowing them more room within

the box.

Doc puts his hand to her face, wiping away a thin trace of

blood from a scratch.

CONTINUED:

Carol tries to smile for the first time in quite a while.

Doc looks across the garbage through the open end of the

crate.

THE HEAT AND THE FLIES HAVE BECOME UNBEARABLE. Carol begins

to scratch her leg.

Carol ignores him, she is in bad shape.

Doc stares at the garbage around them.

Doc smiles, trying to get her to smile again.

Carol rubs one hand along her now terribly soiled, tweed

suit.

She looks away from Doc. Doc stares at her mussed hair and

tear-stained cheeks.

CONTINUED: (2)

Carol turns back, faces Doc. Their eyes find one another.

A pause.

A pause.

CONTINUED: (3)

A long moment.

As she pulls herself against him:

They pull each other closer, tightly holding one another.

RUDY IS LYING IN BED READING A NEWSPAPER PILLED WITH DOC AND

ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE BENCH IS LAUGHLIN'S. FOUR stories

of red brick.

A DOC GETS UP AND CROSSES TO THE HOTEL WITHOUT THE BAG

INT. LAUGHLIN'S HOTEL - DAY

DOC ENTERS AND CROSSES TO LAUGHLIN WHO IS BEHIND THE DESK.

The switchboard is now vacant.

Doc pays him, looks closely into his eyes. Jimmy hasn't

changed and it's set.

CONTINUED:

He picks up the room key. Doc starts for the elevator.

Doc gives Laughlin a half-pissed look, then crosses to the

elevator and pulls the cage door open.

LAUGHLIN WATCHES THE RICKETY, self-service elevator move

upward. He reaches for the desk phone.

INT. ROOM 4L8 - DAY

FRAN, WEARING ONLY A BATHROBE, is doing her nails while

watching an old movie on the black and white tube, seated on

the bed. The phone begins to RING.

Fran looks over to Rudy from her overstuffed armchair.

ELEVATOR DOORS - THIRD FLOOR

CAROL EMERGES THROUGH THE SLIDING DOOR AND TURNS DOWN THE

CORRIDOR. She walks slowly, carrying the heavy suitcase.

Reaching the door to room 31oj Carol knocks rapidly three

times, waits, then raps out two sets of two knocks. The door

swings open and Doc stands within the archway. She enters.

Doc shuts the door and slips his arms around Carol, revealing

his .45 automatic in one hand.

INT. RUDY'S HOTEL ROOM

RUDY IS SPINNING THE CHAMBER on his .44 then shoves it into

his coat pocket. Fran is getting dressed in the middle of the

room, her breasts and thighs ripple outward from the confines

of the bra and girdle.

THE CALICO KITTEN SLEEPS PEACEFULLY IN ITS cardboard box.

INT. BATHROOM 3L8

CAROL IS IN THE SHOWER, STEAM HANGS IN THE AIR as she

vigorously soaps her body, cleansing herself of the residue

left from their cross-country flight.

DOC IN THE MAIN ROOM IS STANDING AT THE LARGE windows facing

across to the building next to Laughlins. The fire escape is

one story beneath him. Doc crosses, throws the suitcase on

the bed, undoes the straps and snaps, lifts the lid open. He

stares at the huge amount of money for a moment, then digs

into the suitcase, reaching down to the bottom. He withdraws

his hand, holding four visas.. He puts two of them on the

bureau drawer top... the other two he begins to tear into

sections and places them into a large ashtray. He touches a

match to the scraps.

THE FLAMES CURL AROUND RUDY'S PHOTOGRAPH in the ashtray.

EXT. AIR TERMINAL - EL PASO ENTRANCE - DAY

THE ACCOUNTANT., SWAIN, CULLY AND HAYHOE APPROACH A PARKED

OLDSMOBILE... A HOOD IS DRIVING.

INT. ROOM

ON THE BED IN DOC AND CAROL'S ROOM, THE SUITCASE IS NOW

CLOSED; the .45 automatic sits beside it... Doc's overcoat

also lies across the bedpsread, near it the wrapped shotgun.

The poster is again on the wall.

CAROL still in the bathroom of room 318. She wears only a

slip. Carol is washing out her bra and panties in the

washbasin, using a coarse bar of soap. Doc enters; he begins

taking off his shirt.

CONTINUED:

INT. FOURTH FLOOR HALLWAY

AS RUDY AND FRAN EMERGE FROM THEIR ROOM. The door shuts

behind them, Rudy guides Fran to the stairs.

INT. BATHROOM 318

DOC STANDS IN THE SHOWER, THE HARD SPRAY BREAKING OVER THE

BACK OF HIS SKULL. Tired, he closes his eyes, rests the side

of his head against the tile.

INT. BEDROOM 318

CAROL STILL WEARING THE SLIP, she lies back across the bed.

Her eyelids slowly fall shut. Carol has pushed the suitcase,

overcoat and .45 off to one side.

RUDY AND FRAN COME DOWN THE STAIRS. Rudy puts one hand inside

his overcoat.

INSIDE THE OLDSMOBILE - EL PASO CITY STREETS

AS THE HOOD DRIVES, SWAIN IS BESIDE HIM IN THE FRONT, CULLY,

THE ACCOUNTANT AND HAYHOE ride in the back seat.

INT. ROOM 318

CAROL IS NAPPING LIGHTLY ON THE BED AS DOC BURSTS out of the

bathroom... again dressed in his shorts, holding his pants in

one hand.

He quickly pulls his pants on...

INT. CORRIDOR THIRD FLOOR

RUDY AND FRAN STEP INTO THE HALLWAY TOWARD ROOM 3l8a passing

several rooms. Fran's face is taut. Rudy starts his nervous

grin.

INT. ROOM

DOC SNAPS HIS ZIPPER CLOSED, REACHES FOR HIS SHIRT.

She looks at him, doesn't move.

CONTINUED:

She is interrupted by a hard knock on the door. Doc drops his

shirt to the floor. He quickly reaches down, lifts his .45.

Doc gestures to Carol... she moves towards the door.

INT. HALLWAY

Fran stands at the door to 318. Rudy is at her shoulder; he

has taken out his revolver.

Doc whips his pen knife out of his pocket, crosses the room

to the locked door of an adjoining hotel room. He begins

forcing the lock.

After a moment:

DOC working on the door; his .45 shoved into the waistband of

his pants.

CAROL thinking hard...

DOC breaks the lock and opens the door -- he quickly crosses

the dark apartment, moves to the front door, slips out his

automatic, then gingerly cracks the door. His eyes tighten in

amazement as he sees:

CONTINUED:

RUDY STANDING SLIGHTLY BEHIND FRAN, his .44 held tightly up

to the door jamb, ready for instantaneous use. Rudy and Fran

are 15 feet down the hallway from Doc's slightly opened door.

They both have their backs turned to him in three-quarter

fashion.

DOC BAREFOOTED., BARE-CHESTED; he decides on a course of

action. The door swings quietly open.

WITHIN THE HALLWAY, DOC CLOSES THE DISTANCE between himself

and Rudy in two swift strides, Rudy turns,, swinging his gun,

too late, as Doc's .45 crashes against his head. Rudy drops.

Fran screams. Rudy looks at Doc, still smiling, eyes glazed.

He falls abruptly. Doc stands over the fallen body. Fran

continues to scream. Doc finally turns away from Rudy,

looking now at the screaming woman. He flattens her with a

left hook to the jaw. Fran drops to the floor as if she had

been shot. Suddenly everything in the corridor is silent.

RUDY'S HEAD IS BLOODIED. He lies without movement.

DOC NOW SLAMS AT THE DOOR OF 318

Carol swings the door open. Doc bursts back into the room,

grabs his shirt, begins to button it.

THE FOURTH FLOOR CORRIDOR

AS DOC AND CAROL COME BACK OUT OF 318 they step over the

fallen bodies and start toward the waiting elevator.

Carol stops as she recognizes Rudy. Doc pulls her along,

forcing her to keep moving. Carol again carries the brown

suitcase, Doc holds the shotgun. They go down the back (or

front) stairs.

INT. LOBBY

THE ACCOUNTANT STANDS AT ONE CORNER OP THE RECEPTION COUNTER

IN THE LOBBY OF LAUGHLINS. Within an alcove behind and to one

side of the desk (the area serving as an office) Cully, Swain

and Hayhoe have stretched Laughlin across the pine desk. The

Accountant eyes both the empty lobby and the entrance to the

hotel3 acting as lookout.

CULLY INSIDE THE ALCOVE LIFTS A SNAPPED OFF LEG of the heavy

chair to use as a club. The thug turns back to the desk where

Swain and Hayhoe have Laughlin pinioned.

LAUGHLIN LOOKS BACK AT CULLY. He is very frightened but says

nothing.

CULLY SLAMS THE WOODEN CLUB DOWN ON LAUGHLIN KNEECAP

He again whacks Laughlin's knee.

INT. LOBBY STAIRS

DOC AND CAROL EMERGE,, MOVING QUICKLY FOR THE. main entrance.

They get five steps before simultaneously seeing the

Accountant.

Doc and Carol freeze for an instant.

The Accountant snaps his fingers twice.

Cully lowers his club, looks to the Accountant, as do Swain

and Hayhoe. The Accountant smiles, staring at Doc and Carol.

CONTINUED:

CULLY, SWAIN AND HAYHOE APPEAR FROM THE ALCOVE BEHIND the

Accountant. They look over his shoulder toward the rear of

the hotel, their eyes finding Doc and Carol.

INT. WITHIN THE MAIN LOBBY

DOC HAS ONE HAND IN HIS OUTSIDE COAT POCKET, WRAPPED

around the .45. Carol continues to hold the suitcase up in

front of herself, almost like a shield. The distance between

Doc and Carol and the hotel entrance has been effectively cut

off by the four opponents standing near the reception desk.

Carol edges backward a few steps, toward the massive wooden

staircase.

Doc's hand comes out of his coat pocket, a slow gesture

revealing that his palm is empty.

THE ACCOUNTANT NOW PLANKED BY THE THREE MEN

As the three men reach for their guns.

DOC MOVES MUCH PASTER. HE DUCKS TO   THE RIGHT, levels the

disguised shotgun and fires in the   same movement. The

reception desk near the Accountant   splinters from the blast

and he is hit painfully. The other   three men duck away from

the sudden burst of fire power.

DOC AND CAROL JUMP FOR THE STAIRS

HAYHOE LEVELS HIS PISTOL AT THE RETREATING COUPLE Another

shot from Doc's riot gun... this one breaking open the floor

at Hayhoe's feet and cutting him down at the knees. Cannon,

Cully, Swain and Max open fire as they dive for cover. They

miss their shots, digging up walls, stairs and flooring.

ON THE WINDING STAIRWAY DOC AND CAROL FLEE UPWARD She

struggles with the heavy suitcase, Doc transfers the riot gun

to his left hand, pulls out the more accurate .45 to use with

his right.

WITHIN THE LOBBY THE SIX MEN SPLIT FORCES

Cully and the Accountant run to the elevator, enter it, pull

the door shut. Swain and Hayhoe, limping, and Cannon and Max

start for the stairwell in direct pursuit of Doc and Carol.

All the men, save the Accountant, now have guns in their

hands.

SWAIN AND HAYHOE CAUTIOUSLY GOING UPWARD. Still below the

first level landing, their eyes search overhead. The SOUND of

Doc and Carol's pounding feet can be heard.

HAYHOE LEANS OUT OVER THE BANISTER, points his gun directly

up and fires.

DOC AND CAROL BETWEEN THE FIRST AND SECOND FLOOR landings as

Hayhoe's bullet tears by, ripping through the wooden banister

supports.

INSIDE THE ELEVATOR THE ACCOUNTANT AND CULLY WATCH the arrow

indicator pass "Two."

DOC AIMING HIS .45 RESTING IT ON THE BANISTER He fires two

shots back down the stairwell.

SWAIN AND HAYHOE MOVING UP THE STEPS TWO AT A TIME Suddenly

Hayhoe's leg buckles as a .45 slug tears through his hip, the

other bullet ripping the plaster wall near his shoulder.

SWAIN IS NOW BESIDE THE BANISTER, he points his 54l revolver

straight up... empties it.

DOC AND CAROL AS SWAIN'S BULLETS BREAK AROUND THEM. Doc pulls

Carol down, lifts the riot gun and fires down the stairwell

with a huge roar.

THE STAIRCASE TEN FEET IN FRONT OF SWAIN IS SMASHED by Doc's

blast. Swain has to climb over the uprooted planking to

continue moving upward. Cannon following.

THE ELEVATOR INDICATOR STOPPING AT "THREE"

CULLY PULLS OPEN THE DOOR, MOVES OUT INTO THE corridor. The

Accountant remains within the elevator.

SWAIN ON THE STAIRWAY FIRES HIS PISTOL UPWARD

CAROL, ON THE STAIRWAY ABOVE, AS THE SHOTS SMASH PAST, runs

ahead of Doc by three steps. They pass the second landing,

keep moving upwards towards the third.

CONTINUED:

Doc's focus of attention is downward. He knows that he and

Carol are being pursued up the stairwell, but he isn't aware

of the fact that the gunsels have split their forces.

RUDY ON THE THIRD FLOOR AGAIN RISES LIKE LAZARUS FROM THE

DEAD. His head bloodied from Doc's heavy pistol, he slowly

wobbles to his feet. Rudy looks down at Fran... she sobs

violently, her back leaning against the wall. Rudy picks up

his .44 then stumbles into the open door of Doc and Carol's

room. He unsteadily crosses to the bathroom, closes the door.

CAROL FRANTICALLY MOVING UPWARD, DOC HAS NOW FALLEN five

steps behind.

DOC FIRES THE .45 DOWN THE STAIRWELL AT

SWAIN ON THE THIRD FLOOR

Cully walks cautiously down the corridor, pistol raised. He

moves toward the landing, having covered one quarter of the

distance from the elevator. The Accountant is still within

the elevator.

Carol comes up the stairwell and looks back for Doc. The

SOUND of Swain's pistol and Doc's answering .45. Carol senses

a movement; she turns and sees Cully's gun leveled at her. As

Carol screams:

Doc dives onto the landing facing the corridor... his plane

of movement knee high.,, the riot gun in his left hand, .45

in his right.

CULLY IS HIT IN THE CHEST BY BUCKSHOT. The killing wounds

fling him upward as he fires his own gun... his aim destroyed

by the death blows,, the bullets stray above Carol, high of

their mark.

DOC FIRES THREE TIMES MORE AT THE ELEVATOR CABLE

THE CORRIDOR WALL NEAR THE ELEVATOR IS SMASHED BY ONE OF the

riot gun's jumbo shots, as is the top of the elevator. The

plaster flies away revealing further damage. The cables are

smashed, the elevator breaks loose and plummets downward.

THE EMERGENCY CABLE, INSIDE THE SHAFT

THE MECHANISM TRANSFERS OVER, line catching within the pulley

housing. The line snaps taut - halting the speeding car.

WITHIN THE LOBBY

AS THE ELEVATOR SLAMS TO A WRENCHING STOP FIVE FEET

ABOVE the floor level. The Accountant bounces from the floor

of the car to the ceiling, then back to the floor.

Laughlin leans across the reception desk in great pain. He

sees the suspended car through the iron grill door.

The Accountant lies completely still on the floor of the

elevator. His head and neck twisted at an oblique angle.

DOC ON THE THIRD FLOOR LANDING

HE JAMS SEVERAL SHELLS INTO HIS RIOT GUN WHILE HOLDING his

.45 ready for an appearance by Swain. Reloading completed, he

stands, with Carol. He again begins to move upward.

SWAIN FIRES FROM THE STAIRWELL

DOC STOPS, SETS BOTH THE RIOT GUN AND THE .45 on 562 the

banister... He waits... on the winding staircase below him

there is a dark movement.

DOC FIRES BOTH GUNS

THE STAIRWELL AROUND SWAIN DISINTEGRATES. The thug is

obliterated by the firepower.

DOC CANNOT SEE THE EFFECT OF HIS SHOTS. He again resumes his

flight upward.

INT. DOC'S BATHROOM

RUDY HOLDS HIS BLOODY HEAD IN THE SINK BOWL, DUMBLY splashing

water over himself. Carol's underwear is still present.

Rudy's pistol lies on the soap tray.

THE LANDING AS DOC AND CAROL COME POUNDING INTO VIEW. No

further avenues open, they turn down the corridor. Doc grabs

Carol and pushes her into the room, past Fran; he kicks the

door shut.

INT. THE ROOM

DOC GRABS THE SUITCASE, RUNS TO THE WINDOW, TEARS off the

shade, lifts the frame, looks. The drop is too far. He grabs

Carol and runs into the hallway.

INT. CORRIDOR

THEY RUN DOWN TWO DOORS AND BREAK IN. Over the door is the

sign "Fire Escape."

INT. FIRE ESCAPE ROOM

DOC HELPS CAROL OUT ONTO THE FIRE ESCAPE. He aids her with

his left hand, the riot gun now clutched tightly in his

right. He motions, she hands him the suitcase and follows.

EXT. FIRE ESCAPE

THEY DESCEND THE FIRE ESCAPE. They reach the end. The fire

escape stays rigid.

Doc cautiously steps on to the tilted steps. He turns and

with the suitcase crosses to the end. Throws the bag and the

shotgun across the 6 foot gap to the retaining wall,

preparing to jump.

RUDY COMES OUT OF THE ROOM ONTO THE FIRE ESCAPE holding his

.44. He looks down at Doc, then slowly raises his gun. Carol

screams.

DOC JUMPS. RUDY FIRES. DOC IS HIT IN THE SIDE (flesh wound).

In the air he spins and lands. Rudy fires again and again as

he runs down the fire escape. Doc rolls, picks up the shotgun

and fires.

RUDY'S TIME HAS COME. THE JUMBO CHARGES MASH HIM BACK against

the wall and off the fire escape.

CAROL RUNS ALMOST STAGGERING AND GETS READY TO JUMP the six

feet.

THE FIRE ESCAPE. BEGINS TO SINK. CAROL LOOKS AT DOC mutely,

as she sinks beneath the retaining wall.

And she does. He catches her and pulls her up.

They look at one another for a long moment, then he stands

and helps her to her feet, and leaving the shotgun behind

they walk into the alley.

RUDY LIES DEAD BEHIND THEM

IN A PARKING LOT AT THE END OF THE ALLEY, SLIM, a tough,

grizzly Western is about to pull out. Doc opens the back door

and Carol gets in. Doc opens the front door as Slim turns and

looks at him.

CONTINUED:

He lets out a yell and guns across the lot over the four foot

drop to the sidewalk and into and off a car and into the

street.

The car pulls forward as the light blinks to green.

EXT. STREET

AS THE CAR PASSES AN INTERSECTION, SEVERAL POLICE cars can be

seen arriving at the front of Laughlins.

The car continues moving up the street, then makes a right

onto a larger boulevard.

Doc half turns to Carol.

CONTINUED:

Slim is obviously pleased that some excitement has come into

his life.

Doc and Carol look at the man.

EXT. CASETA BRIDGE CROSSING - DAY

THE AMERICAN OFFICIALS SIMPLY WAVE THE CAR BY.

At the white line a Mexican CUSTOMS OFFICER emerges from the

station house. As he looks inside the car:

CONTINUED:

The Official smiles and motions them past.

INT. CAR

AS IT HEADS INTO CHIHUAHUA ON THE MEXICAN SIDE.

Slim stops the car near the soft shoulder of the dirt road.

Doc looks at Slim.

CONTINUED:

Doc turns to Carol.

As she begins to open the suitcase...

A WAD OF MONEY DISAPPEARING INTO SLIM'S POCKET

DOC LOOKS AT SLIM

CONTINUED:

Slim steps out of the car, Carol moves into the front seat as

Doc slides behind the wheel.

DOC SLIPS THE CAR into gear.

The car pulls forward. Slim waves goodbye, then turns and

begins walking back down the highway.

BACK INSIDE THE CAR, DOC ACCELERATES AWAY

CONTINUED:

After a moment:

Carol snaps on the radioj the voice of a Mexican announcer is

heard.

She spins the dial. Mariachi music comes on.

EXT. MAIN HIGHWAY

AS THEY HIT THE MAIN HIGHWAY, DOC PULLS OFF AND STOPS.

THEY ARE WALKING ALONG THE HIGHWAY, THE EDSEL IS now a dot in

the background. Another dot appears, grows bigger, as it gets

closer it is a bus. Very Mexican but very Greyhound in

appearance.

Doc and Carol turn, Doc flags it down.

It pulls to a stop, they board. The bus pulls out.

INT. BUS

DOC PAYS AND THEN FOLLOWS CAROL TO A SEAT.

They sit. Mexico rolls by outside the window.

They look at each other and smile.

CONTINUED:

Doc and Carol look back.

THE BLACK PANTHER IS LEANING OVER THE SEAT, his empty fist

cocked up like a pistol. He grins.

Doc and Carol look at him.

FREEZE FRAME.

THE END
