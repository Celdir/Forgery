EXT. CEDARS-SINAI - WIDE - DAY

A monolith with alienating foregrounds. A bus pulls in on

Beverly. NEIL McCAULEY and a nurse get off. Neil carries

a paper bag and wears white pants like a hospital attendant.

Neil is an ice-cold professional: very big, very tough.

At 42 his short black hair is graying. He spent eight

years in McNeil and three in San Quentin. He got out and

hit the street in 1987. Four of the McNeil years were

spent in the hole. Neil's voice is street, but his language

is precise like an engineer's. He's very careful and very

good. Neil runs a professional crew that pulls down high

line, high number scores and does it anyway the score has

to be taken down: if on the prowl (a burglary), that's

fine; if they have to go in strong (armed), that's fine

too. And if you get in their way, that's got to be your

problem. His lifestyle is obsessively functional. There's

no steady woman or any encumbrance. Neil McCauley keeps

it so there's nothing he couldn't walk from in 30 seconds

flat.

ANGLE

Right now, he enters the big double doors and pulls a white

intern's coat from his paper bag.

INT. CEDARS-SINAI CORRIDOR - TRAVELING TWO SHOT - DAY

We DOLLY on Neil as he crosses through the long crowded

corridor. Patients, nurses, interns and doctors pass by.

A P.A. broadcasts occasional messages.

PROFILE

Nail crosses under an "EMERGENCY" sign and keeps going

towards the exit doors.

TRAVELING - FRONTAL

Neil APPROACHES THE CAMERA. From the other direction two

ambulance attendants wheel an old man under oxygen and

pass by Neil.

WIDE REAR SHOT

Without breaking his stride from the moment he got off the

bus, Neil exits through the doors, examines four ambulances

parked in the slots, climbs into one and drives off. Maybe

he's stolen it. We don't know.

EXT. R & C CONSTRUCTION SUPPLIES - ON CHRIS - DAY

CHRIS SHIHERLIS crosses past stacks of gravel and cement

with a white-coated BLACK CLERK. Chris wears a hard hat

over a mongol cut, Levi's, black boots and a sleeveless

sweat shirt and carries on one shoulder a 150 lb., red,

Milwaukee Tool Company case. He looks like a construction

worker by day who by night hits L.A's slams, jams and raves.

He's 29, from Austin, Texas. Chris is also a highline

pro: a boxman who knows five ways to open any safe made.

Right now he's buying a hollow core drill. He and McCauley

were cellmates in San Quentin Penitentiary from 1984 to

1987. Chris hit the streets in 1988. He's a hot dog and

spends money as fast as he makes it. Right now, he and

the Clerk exit to the sales counter.

EXT. SALES COUNTER - TWO SHOT

As they approach, the Clerk goes behind it.

Chris pays; Clerk writes receipt.

He leaves with the heavy red case.

INT. "TOYS 'R' US STORE" - ON CERRITO - DAY

MICHAEL CERRITO - at 40 - is looking at a doll house.

He's a wide, thick, coarse-featured big man. Sicilian

from Sunnyside, he's spent 15 years in Attica, Joliet and

Marion penitentiaries. He's strictly a "cowboy": his

natural inclination towards a score is "...get the guns

and let's go." He's been off smack and everything else

for five years. He's clean and sober. He's the nicest

guy on the block and a loving father. If you get in his

way, he'll kill you as soon as look at you. If you asked

him about the contradictions, he wouldn't know what you

were talking about.

CLOSE OR DOLL HOUSE DETAILS

It's 3 x 6 and two feet high. Miniature room sets are

inside. Cerrito's thick fingers close the door. He picks

it up. WIDEN. He crosses to a counter and MIDDLE-AGED

CLERK.

Clerk takes down Clark Gable, Three-eyed Monster, and

Beautiful Lady, full-head rubber masks.

INT. CONDOMINIUM - A HAND - MORNING

Slides across the back of JUSTINE'S thigh.

JUSTINE'S AND HANNA'S FACES

She is 29, auburn,  languorous, her eyes are closed and she

makes love with her  husband, VINCENT HANNA. Pressing her

face to his, their  hair intertwined... It's morning. We

are in an expensive  condominium.

WIDE

The two bodies locked into the rhythms of their love-making,

twisted in white sheets. OFF SCREEN a shower runs.

INT. SHOWER - HANNA

Is in it. The water streams off his body. The glass is

misted. He turns off only the hot and breathes fast in

the cold spray. OFF SCREEN a cigarette lighter CLICKS.

BEDROOM - JUSTINE

smoking, still under the white sheets, watches Hanna dress.

LAUREN, Justine's daughter, is 15 and tall and anxious.

Hanna clips a 2" .38 in his waistband.       Justine shrugs and

shakes her head.

He leaves.

INT. MACARTHUR PARK, MEN'S ROOM - ON WAINGRO - DAY

Bare-chested washing at a sink. WAINGRO'S 27. He sports

prison tattoos including an Aryan Brotherhood swastika

covering his abdomen. He's a graduate of the "gladiator

academies," Chino and Tracy.

He's dressed in Army and Navy Store gray workman's clothes.

He combs his long hair straight back off his round forehead.

Now he tucks his shirt in and puts on wrap around shades.

EXT. MACARTHUR PARK - WAINGRO

Waits. His shell jacket is in a tight roll under his arm.

Then a garbage truck - a Dempsey Dumpster (the kind with a

power forklift on the front) - pulls up.

INT. TRUCK - WIDE - DAY

Michael Cerrito is the driver.

He climbs in. Cerrito pulls out. Waingro - delayed -

offers his hand. Cerrito has to wait until he finishes

his gear change to shake it. The timing's a little weird.

Just do like he says.    Exactly... like ... he ... says.

They have to talk loudly over the clapped-out ENGINE'S

NOISE.

EXT. ALLEY - ON GARBAGE TRUCK - DAY

It's ABRUPTLY QUIET. The truck's parked. The two men sit

idly. Waingro finishes take-out coffee and tosses the

empty.

INT. TRUCK - CERRITO

Lights a cigarette. Belatedly, he offers one to Waingro.

Waingro lights up. The two men relax under the swirls of

blue smoke.

Awkward pause.

Cerrito looks at Waingro.   He wants to protect his

concentration.

It ends the conversation. Waingro drums his fingernails

on the dash. He's anxious.

CHEVY TOWTRUCK - ON TOWNER - DAY

TOWNER'S a sloppy, nondescript man in his 40's. He slouches

behind the wheel. A Bearcat 210 Scanner is under the dash

and a walkie-talkie on the seat. As in the garbage truck,

it's quiet and he waits. Then:

At a low level we HEAR POLICE CALLS.

INT. AMBULANCE - TWO SHOT - DAY

Chris and Neil are sitting in the front seat of the

ambulance Neil drove away from the hospital.

Chris turns it OFF.   A little anxiety develops.

INT. GARBAGE TRUCK - TWO SHOT - DAY

Waingro stubs out his cigarette in nervous jabs. Cerrito

pulls from a paper bag two of the rubber masks he bought

and surgical gloves. He and Waingro put them on quickly.

Cerrito has the monster mask three eyes and a twisted mouth.

Waingro is a beautiful woman. Their movements now are

very fast. Cerrito pulls the truck out of the alley.

CERRITO'S POV:

As we approach the street an armored truck passes by. We

fall in behind. At this point we realize these men are

going to pull down an armed robbery of this armored truck.

But, we turn LEFT. The armored truck went straight. Then

we turn RIGHT. However we SEE the armored truck again.

It turned left. Our paths will intersect at 90 degrees.

Meanwhile:

INT. AMBULANCE - ON NEIL - DAY

He checks the chamber and then inserts into the    grip of

his 9mm. Browning a 14-shot clip. Chris works      the slide

of a Remington 810, 12-gauge shotgun and puts on    a welder's

helmet. Neil pulls on the rubber mask of Donald     Duck and

slings a stopwatch on a string around his neck.

EXT. STREET - WIDE ON AMBULANCE + STREET BEHIND IT

The lumbering armored truck approaches...

INT. ARMORED TRUCK - DRIVER'S POV: APPROACHING AMBULANCE -

DAY

With FLASHERS going. Suddenly it pulls diagonally across

the narrow street, as if trying a three point turn: Driver

of the armored truck slams on his brakes.

INT. GARBAGE TRUCK - CERRITO'S POV: ARMORED TRUCK IN

PROFILE - DAY

We're accelerating at it.

CERRITO'S FOOT

punches the accelerator.

FRONTAL: GARBAGE TRUCK

a prehistoric beast charging at us.

CERRITO'S POV: JAMMING

at the armored truck.

COLLISION

We SLAM into it,

WIDE: ARMORED TRUCK

knocked onto its side, crushes against a wall.

INT. ARMORED CAR - DRIVER - DAY

Stunned, pinned inside. Their world is sideways.     It rains

desposit slips. GUARD ONE grabs the radio mike:

EXT. ALLEY - ON REAR OF ARMORED TRUCK

Neil, Chris, Cerrito and Waingro are on the move...

INT. CHEVY APACHE PICKUP - TOWNER - DAY

Listens to his BEARCAT POLICE SCANNER,

EXT. STREET - VEIL

With his radio earpiece starts a CHRONOMETER with a LOUD

CLICK.

ARMORED TRUCK - CHRIS

in a welder's mask with the hollow core drill drives the

10" diameter bit into the truck's armored plating. Neil

looks at his stopwatch.

CLOSE - DRILL BIT

SCREAMING of metal as the hollow-core bit tears through

steel.

SHOTS

Neil with his Browning. Cerrito has an AR15 with its stock

collapsed. Waingro has a 9mm. Beretta.

CHRIS

The bit has cut a 10" circle into the side through the

armored plating. Now Chris heaves the drill aside, steps

away, swings up his shotgun as...

CERRITO

swings a sledgehammer at the 10" disc.        It falls inside

as.

NEIL

pulls the pin and tosses a grenade into the hole.        It

EXPLODES and pours smoke.

INT. ARMORED CAR - GUARD ONE

Coughing.     His mask doesn't work.   He lurches for the

door...

EXT. STREET - ARMORED CAR

Door crashes down, opens, Guard One falls out. Then GUARD

TWO. The DRIVER comes out his door. Cerrito grabs him.

Neil handles the two Guards.

He yanks their guns away - his 9mm.      At the back of each

man's head in turn.

THE DRIVER

tries to twist away as a reflex. Cerrito cracks him in

the face with the AR15, driving him to the wall.

WIDE: CERRITO + WAINGRO

cover the three. Neil moves into the Armored Truck to

join Chris who's already inside, ripping it apart,

searching. We see him disregard cash.

NEIL'S STOPWATCH

1:12.

WAINGRO

behind the Beautiful Lady mask: trying hard to do good.

His gun jumps from Guard to Guard to Guard.

NEIL

looks at Waingro.   WIDEN.   Waingro's aware of Neil's

scrutiny.

He slaps the back of Guard Two's head with the gun barrel.

WIDE

Neil and Chris emerge from the van with one manila envelope.

WIDE: WAINGRO

It's like Waingro can't hear. He's fixated with Guard

Two. Guard Two turns and looks at him arrogantly - more

concerned with his masculine pride than his safety. He's

a stupid man.

WAINGRO'S POV: VERY WIDE

Things happen slowly.

Waingro's arm points out at the man - with the gun at the

end - and FIRES.

ANGLE

Guard Two is blown up against the wall.    Driver moves...

NEIL

leaving, spins.

DRIVER

reaching for a two-inch hammerless .38 back-up tucked in

his boot. As he brings it up...

NEIL'S 9MM. BROWNING

FIRES TWO HAMMERED-ON SHOTS.

CERRITO'S AR15

covers Guard One. Guard One stares at the men in the masks.

Once killing begins, he knows what will happen. Cerrito

looks at Neil...

NEIL

angry; nods.

CERRITO

kills Guard One with THREE SHOTS.

ON AMBULANCE

Neil literally throws Waingro into the back.

INT. AMBULANCE - ON CERRITO - DAY driving, lays rubber

down the alley. ON NEIL at watch.

INT. WHITE CHEVY APACHE TOWTRUCK - ON TOWNER - DAY

We HEAR police dispatcher on the Bearcat scanner.

Towner drops the walkie-talkie out the window.    He's

fastened a professional racing harness.

EXT. STREET - REAR SHOT ON AMBULANCE - DAY

Skidding right into another side street.

REVERSE: BLACK + WHITE

in Code 3 scraping between the garbage truck and wall -

roars TO CAMERA. One cop already has his shotgun up.

EXT. SIDE STREET - WIDE: AMBULANCE - DAY

Left down the street with FLASHERS going.

WIDE PROFILE: AMBULANCE

Streaks THROUGH THE FRAME.     HOLD and SEE the Chevy towtruck

with Towner.

TOWNER

guns the engine.

BLACK + WHITE

bounces around the corner, the rear end comes out, skidding

left. Towner floors the towtruck. We SEE it's heavy front

bumper RAM the police car sideways.

EXT. GAS STATION - BLACK + WHITE

Is SMASHED SIDEWAYS into the station, careens off two cars

filling up...

ANGLE

... plows through a rack of pumps, takes out the air and

water reservoirs and wraps itself around a lamppost.

Towner's towtruck's gone.

EXT. RESIDENTIAL SIDE STREET - AMBULANCE - DAY

Pulls in and parks. Everyone abandons it, leaving masks,

rubber gloves, equipment, outer clothing inside. They

cross to a Chevrolet Caprice. They climb in. They pull

out.

EXT. GAS STATION - WIDE - DAY

One   cop has a cut forehead, tries to stand. Two more black

and   whites pull in - flashers going. The driver staggers

out   from behind the wheel and tries to shake clarity into

his   head. He sits on the pavement.

EXT. LAX PARKING LOT - WIDE BETWEEN THE CARS - DAY

Planes ROAR overhead in landings or takeoffs. Yellow vapor

lamps glare. It's gaudy with lights. Neil and a man named

NATE are parked next to each other facing opposite

directions. Nate's 50 - an ex-prize fighter with his nose

all over his face in a silver Mercedes. His big muscles

have gone to flab. He wears a yellow rayon shirt. He's

deeply tanned and pock-narked.

Nate functions as a middleman and fence for Neil. All

calls from people who want to contact Neil come to Nate.

Right now he examines the manila envelope from the armored

truck. Neil's in a Lincoln Town car, gray suit, white

shirt, no tie.

CLOSE: ENVELOPE

contains 80 x $20,000 negotiable Treasury Certificates.

Nate's counting.

WIDE - FROM THE FRONT

Nate gives a large envelope to Neil.

Nate pulls T.C.'s.

He's got insurance.

Neil starts the car.   Nate pulls away in his Mercedes.

WIDE

an L1011 ROARS overhead.   Neil pulls out.

EXT. ALLEY - WIDE ON PAVEMENT - DAY

We're looking at chalk outlines of the bodies of Guard one

and Driver from the armored truck. The pavement is

bloodstained. Bright lights illuminate the crime scene.

WIDEN TO REVEAL Hanna who we now identify as a police

lieutenant of detectives. He's just arrived. The alley's

been roped off with sawhorses labeled "crime area." The

armored truck with the holed side is still there. One of

Hanna's crew, DRUCKER, a black intelligence analyst and

technician at 45, was already there. A uniformed SGT.

HEINZ was there first and by procedure took command. It's

his crime scene.

Two more of Hanna's crew arrive in an unmarked car and

join him: CASALS - bald at 30 and wiry; BOSKO - a huge,

oversized man.

Guy's nearly blind.

They move toward the Forensic Unit, scraping tire rubber

and measuring distances as we

INT. EARLY 60'S COFFEE SHOP - WIDE - NIGHT

It's 1963 futuristic: flagstone and rubber plants. Most

of the patrons are night people: pimps, hookers, customers,

disintegrating couples, etc. We PAN AROUND the interior

and settle on a booth by a window. In the booth are Chris

and Cerrito on one side and Waingro alone.

CERRITO

looks at Waingro, sips his coffee, and looks away again

Waingro is nervous.

CHRIS

sees something in the parking lot.

DOOR - NEIL

enters, crosses to the booth, slides in across from Waingro.

CLOSE

The four men huddle together and talk in a whisper. Neil

pulls out three yellow envelopes, presumably full of money.

Neil will talk about Waingro in the third person as if he

inanimate.

Cerrito and Chris looks at Waingro.

Chris nods.    Waingro's speechless.   Neil flips him an

envelope.

Waingro doesn't move.

Neil grabs the back of Waingro's neck, slams the side of

his face onto the table top and flicks the middle finger

of his left against waingro's temple. Neil could kill

him.

Flick.    Cerrito looks around the coffee shop: it's quiet.

Waingro does nothing. Neil shoves him into the corner of

the booth. Plates fall. All three get up and walk out.

EXT. COFFEE SHOP, REAR PARKING LOT - WIDE - NIGHT

Neil, Cerrito and Chris cross past cars.

ANGLE - WAINGRO

whines, cries and charges into Neil's shoulder from behind

and spins him around, wanting to explain to him. This

time:

NEIL

knees Waingro in the stomach. Waingro folds over. Neil

slams both open palms on Waingro's ears and knees him in

the face. Waingro sprawls over a car hood and falls off.

CLOSER - NEIL

kicks Waingro in the side driving him between cars where

it is more secluded while Cerrito and Chris casually look

a-round and back away to cover him because they know Neil

is going to kill him now. As Neil draws his .45 ...

Neil looks. Across the street cruises a black and white.

He watches it pass. His attention goes back to Waingro.

As his .45 comes up.

CLOSER: NEIL

turning, mildly surprised.

NEIL'S POV: NOTHING

Waingro's disappeared.

WIDER: NEIL

searches under cars, carefully.    Nothing.

HIGH + WIDE

Waingro's gone. Neil with Cerrito and Chris following

scan the spaces and shadows as they back out of the large

parking lot.

INT. SHIHERLIS APARTMENT - ON CHARLENE - NIGHT

CHARLENE - twenty-six, in skin-tight black pants and black

hair. They're on their way out. The apartment is heavy

on computer games, video gear, appliances and children's

furniture. Re: envelope:

Chris enters from the bedroom. While buttoning a shirt,

he's mostly oblivious. It frustrates the hell out of

Charlene.

Slips on a boot.

Pulls on boot two.

Chris shoves her up against the wall.

He means it. She knows it. He takes the car keys and

goes. She's frozen to the spot.

EXT. CERRITO'S BUNGALOW - WIDE - NIGHT

A modest West L.A. bungalow that's been remodeled beyond

neighborhood values. A 1990 Coupe de Ville's in the drive.

Cerrito pulls his black '93 Eldorado up behind it. A

NEIGHBOR shuts off his sprinkler. Cerrito gets out and

pulls the wrapped up doll house out of the trunk.

WIDEN TO INCLUDE ANITA CERRITO (7) running up with LINDA

CERRITO (9) not far behind. She jumps into her dad's arms.

INT. CERRITO HOUSE - ON CERRITO - DAY

Entering: home theater system, Hawaiian art prints in

lacquer frames.

ELAINE CERRITO - a dark, heavy-set woman who was dynamite

at 25 and still sensual at 40 - enters from kitchen and

kisses cerrito.

She exits to kitchen.   Cerrito sits down and pulls Anita

onto his lap.

They start shouting: c'mon c'mon.    Elaine enters with her

class of red wine.

They run out. He whispers to Elaine who sits on the side

of his chair and drapes an arm across his shoulder. Michael

Cerrito is a family man and the nicest guy on the block.

INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE, ENTRANCE - A RECTANGLE OF NIGHT

SKY - NIGHT

Then Neil's Town Car enters down the ramp and passes

through. It's deserted and quiet.

EXT. GARAGE - ON NEIL - NIGHT

Driving away in his personal car, an Eldorado in black.

EXT. SANTA MONICA 3RD STREET - ON NEIL - NIGHT

It's almost deserted. Neil enters from Arizona Avenue.

He's alone. It's windy. The collar of his gray suit is

up, the lapels are closed over his white shirt.

INT. HENESSEY AND INGALLS BOOKSTORE - NEIL - NIGHT

Looks at a large book in the Engineering section. He

specifically flips back and forth between full-color plates

of electronic micrographs of different kinds of steel.

WIDEN TO INCLUDE EADY TSE - 28, 5'8". Chinese, long black

hair to her waist. Her face is high cheek-boned and

intelligent. She wears a gray corduroy smock over a

turtleneck shirt and jeans. She speaks English in American

vernacular with only the slightest trace of an accent.

Eady leans back against the book case.

Crossing store.

Holds out hand.

He holds onto her hand and stares down into her face.

They both smile. She laughs and looks away first. They

continue to a rear locked case.

INT. HANNA'S CAR TRAVELLING - HANNA - NIGHT

Floating through the green xenon nightgown, hits a stored

number in his cellular phone's memory.

INT. HANNA CONDOMINIUM - HANNA - NIGHT

Lets himself in the door.   He's beat.   He throws his coat

at the chair.

INT. KITCHEN - STOVE

The dried-out remains of dinner. Hanna roots around, grabs

a lamb chop, forgets the rest and goes into the living

room. INT. HANNA LIVING ROOM - JUSTINE sees Hanna, goes

back to book.

Justine looks at him, elegantly rises, exits into the

bedroom and closes the door.

INT. DINER - GRILLMAN - NIGHT

Flips eggs, bastes, and covers them. The grill is all

quilted steel and immaculate. At the other end of the

counter a waiter reads a paper.

NEIL AND EADY

on stools.

A little hesitant, Eady drinks her coffee.

EXT. EADY'S HOUSE, BALCONY - NEIL + EADY - NIGHT

The house is high in the hill's over sunset. They stare

down at the City - like an ocean of small lights. From

the previous scene we HEAR:

Pause.    They drink scotch in highball glasses.

There's a long pause.    Then:

He pulls her closer.    A pre-dawn red band cracks the

horizon.

His hands hold her face as he looks into her eyes and she

moves to him.

INT. BEDROOM - WHITE - NIGHT

Fills the screen as we PAN ALONG the drapery of sheets to

Neil's wide-awake eyes. Next to him Eady's asleep.

SAME - HIGH ANGLE OVER NEIL ONTO EADY - LATER

Neil is dressed now.    He stands at the foot of the bed

looking at Eady.

NEIL'S HAND

enters with a glass of water wrapped in a paper napkin and

sets it on the bedside table.

It's odd: a convict's meticulousness. He moves the covers

up to her chin. There is to his touch, tenderness, as if

they were longtime lovers.

We realize what we are seeing is the emotionality Neil

McCauley keeps in the closet.

HIGH + WIDE

Neil is gone. He paused for that moment before he left,

as if to engrave her image in his memory.

INT. ALBERT TORENA'S APARTMENT - ALBERT TORENA - DAY

Answers the door. Daylight floods in past the silhouette

of Hanna who shoves Torena in the chest, knocking him into

the apartment. Hanna, following him in...

ALBERT TORENA'S an anorexic Latino fence. Hanna scans the

apartment. Religious objects crowd the mantle. Fourteen

stolen tv's in packing cases in the dining room.

Hanna leaves.

INT - TRAILER - CEZAR KELSO - DAY

WIDEN TO INCLUDE NEIL - who doesn't say anything.   CEZAR

KELSO'S a large crippled man in a wheelchair.

Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org   34.

That gives Neil pause. Kelso gets satisfaction from Neil's

reaction to the amount. Then:

They shake hands.

EXT. TRAILER COURT, PAY PHONE - NATE - DAY

INT. MALIBU SECURITIES, VAN ZANT OFFICE - VAN ZANT - DAY

On the phone to Nate. There's green forest and blue water

dioramas inset into wood-panelled walls.

EXT. KELSO TRAILER COURT - NEIL - DAY

Entering from Kelso's trailer, meets Nate halfway to the

car. Walking and talking:

They walk to their cars and leave.

INT. LILLIAN'S CAR - LILLIAN AND BREEDAN - DAY

Pull into Robert's Coffee Shop in Culver City. BREEDAN at

29 he's an ex-Eight Trey Hoover Street Crip with lots of

scars who just did five years in San Quentin and is

straightening up. He's gangster clean and pressed and

it's there in his body movements and eyes.

She laughs and drives away.

INT. ROBERT'S COFFEE SHOP, KITCHEN - BREEDAN - DAY

Enters the kitchen. The manager is SOLENKO - large with

gray features, smallpox scars and thinning hair. He's

forty-five. NOISE OF DISHWASHER, P.A., POTS CLATTERING.

Solenko throws orders together and plates onto the metal

counter for waitress to pick up. They shout over the

RACKET.

At this point we don't know what David Breedan's doing in

this picture.

INT. XYZ DISCOUNT APPLIANCES BACK OFFICE - JOE CUZOMANO -

DAY

Hears a buzzer and looks up.     His eyes go to a video

monitor.

VIDEO MONITOR: HANNA

among the racks and tv sets playing the sane soap.

Joe pushes a button. The electric lock is released.

CUZOMANO is a 300-pound fat man.

Cuzomano starts punching numbers into his phone.

Cuzomano gets an answer. He shakes his head "no" to Hanna.

Hanna's out the door. Cuzomano breathes easier.

EXT. NEIL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - WIDE - DAY

The Camaro slides soundlessly down Wilshire and into the

underground garage of a high-rise, green glass steel.

INT. NEIL'S - APARTMENT - NEIL - DAY

Enters. It's white and barren. A TV SET     in one corner on

the floor PLAYS a MUTE GAME SHOW. Chris    is rolled up in a

blanket in front of it. The apartment is    lived in by one

man. It tells us Neil's personal life is    a blank.

NEIL

comes out of the bedroom with a pillow. He yanks Christ

shoes off. Neil punches a number. RINGING. Then:

INT. SHIHERLIS BEDROOM - CLOSE ON CHARLENE IN BED - DAY

Charlene rubs sleep from her eyes.    Switches hands on the

phone.

She hangs up and closes her eyes.    She hates his guts.

INT. NEIL'S APARTMENT, KITCHEN - CHRIS - DAY

Is hung over. Neil brings coffee to a Formica table.

Chris's shirt from last night is ripped and his lip's cut.

He looks like hell. Neil puts his Browning on the table.

Chris crosses to the sink and turns the dish sprayer onto

his face and the back of his neck.

Big pause.

Their feelings and understanding run deep.    Chris is

committed to making it work.

Neil slips his Browning back into his waistband.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - MARCIANO - DAY

MARCIANO is Las Vegas sharp at 48: a tall, tanned,

ponytailed, middle-aged hustler and sucker for a young

chick. His phone is ringing. He answers it.

INT. SHIHERLIS BEDROOM - CHARLENE - DAY

Drinking coffee, speeding.

EXT. HAMBURGER STAND - CLOSE NEIL - DAY

On phone.

INT. EADY'S HOUSE - EADY - DAY

In an ink-stained smock.

She hangs up.    He wonders about doing this, puts it aside.

EXT. HAMBURGER STAND, PHONE BOOTH - NEIL

Takes a deep breath. Maybe he's not sure of what he's

into. It passes. He crosses the counter.

Across the street is the Hiawatha Motel in 40's stucco and

desert pastels and Charlene's yellow El Dorado parked next

to a Lexus in front of Room 18.

NEIL DIALS

Suddenly Neil turns because he sees.

NEIL'S POV: ALAN MARCIANO

leaves Room 18, waves goodbye to Charlene and crosses to

Lexus.

In the b.g. Marciano pulls away.

He hangs up. He waits.     The PHONE RINGS. He answers. He

says nothing. He nods.     He hangs up. He crosses the street

lot to the Motel.

EXT. ROOM 18 - WIDE

Neil knocks.

She does. She closes her eyes, resigned to doom.    He walks

past her into the room.

INT. ROOM 18 - WIDE - DAY

One unmade bed. Neil looks.At the tacky interior. He

crosses to the bathroom and turns on the water. He advances

on Charlene who's backing up.- She falls over a waste can.

Neil kicks the waste can out of the way.    It clatters across

the room.

Neil closes in.

Charlene gets attentive.   She's backed into the corner and

can't get any smaller.

Neil grabs the whole lower part of her face in one hand.

His face is inches from hers.

Charlene hesitates; then acquiesces.

Neil leaves.

EXT. CRENSHAW BLVD. - HANNA'S CAR - NIGHT,

Weaves through traffic.    Horns BLARE.

EXT. ZEBRA CLUB - DOORMAN - NIGHT

A muscular black man named ALPHONSE has his back to us at

the rear delivery entrance to a mall awash with Korean

neon.

Hanna's jammed two fingers in his back.   Alphonse spins;

sees it's Hanna.

Alphonse flips Hanna a small vial of coke.

Filtering up from downstairs comes 80dB of Jane's

Addiction's cover of "Sympathy for the Devil".

INT. FREIGHT ELEVATOR - HANNA - NIGHT

Descending alone uses a small, black, carbon steel sheath

knife to take two hits from the vial. He shakes off the

initial blast, pockets the vial, the doors open, Jane's

Addiction's LOUDER. We're ...

INT. ZEBRA - HANNA

Crosses through the mostly black, affluent crowd of players,

gangsters, dopesters, models and security in business suits

openly carrying and wearing headset radios. Hanna crosses

through like he owns the place, gestures to the bartender

and slides into...

INT. BOOTH - RAOUL TORENA

RAOUL TORENA, Albert's brother, is a thirty-five-year-old

with crew-cut black hair and a Varri Uomo sport jacket.

WIDEN To INCLUDE Hanna.

Hanna's gaze drifts up into Raoul's eyes: it's deadly.

Hanna jerks Raoul by the front of his Verri Uomo which is

being destroyed in Hanna's fists.

Hanna throws him back against the bench.

Low, flat and deadly:

Raoul leans back in the booth, nods his head, proud of

this pearl of information. Hanna looks at Albert like

he's crazy.

Hanna gets up to leave.

Hanna plays it low key.   Hanna sits back down.

INT. CAR - HANNA - NIGHT

On the phone. The back side of downtown is a wall of light

moving past as ...

INT. LAPD, MCU OFFICE - BOSKO - NIGHT

Hanna's on the speaker phone.   Casals enters.

INTERCUT WITH:

Bosko answers another phone, puts that line on "hold" as...

"Sympathy for the Devil" gets LOUDER and washes across

onto...

EXT. SUNSET. BOULEVARD MOTEL AND ALLEY - NIGHT

Neon under the vapor lamps. O.S. the cacophony of horns

and sirens. Pimps and hookers crowd the background. A

crime scene area near the garbage cans is roped off. An

ambulance, black-and-whites, a Medical Examiner's van clog

the alley.

CRANE DOWN as Hanna's car pulls in and he approaches the

Medical Examiner, RICHIE, 25-35, black, diamond earring,

gray lab coat.

POLAROID - BLACK PROSTITUTE

in a nightgown, folded over the lip of a garbage can at

the waist. She's a pitiful rag doll. Someone killed her

and then threw her away.

HANNA

is too controlled.    Anger's underneath.

THEIR POV: HEAVYSET BLACK WOMAN

and two stunned young boys. She's crying and arguing with

two uniformed LAPD trying to hold her back. One LAPD is a

black woman. The heavyset woman doesn't really know what

happened yet except it's bad.

RICHIE + HANNA

Now Richie bends over the body bag on the ground and unzips

it. We don't see the dead girl. We only see Hanna. A

third uniformed officer in the background spins away.

Hanna rises. The mother's arguing with the man cop because

she wants to see. Horror and hysteria blossoming through

shock. She pushes the uniformed cop of the way. Hanna

goes to try to help. They grapple.

Anguish. It's a mess. The woman collapsing into Hanna's

arms. For one moment Hanna's eyes lock onto hers. He

freezes. One doesn't forget the look he sees in her eyes.

EXT. DRIVE-IN THEATER - CAPRICE WORK CAR - DAY

driven by Neil to camera appears and disappears up and

down the earthwork ramps. We don't know what he's doing

in one the last drive-in theaters in California at high

noon.

WIDE FROM THE REAR

The white screen reveals its cracks and patches.

CLOSE ON ENTRANCE

A yellow full size Dodge pickup with darkened windows

enters. It hesitates and then slowly drives toward Neil -

up and the ramps between the speaker poles.

ON DODGE PICK UP

circling wide and coming up almost parallel to the Caprice.

As the driver pulls to a stop we see an envelope on the

da...

MAN

crawls under the pick-up and   Neil's car and emerges on the

passenger side behind Neil's   rear wheel in Neil's blind

spot. He inches towards the    window. He  carries a 15-shot

Colt .22 Woodsman with a huge   silencer.  He is totally

relaxed and professional.

NEIL

concentrates on the driver, who's calm.

DRIVER

Starts to reach for the envelope and tosses it into Neil's

car.

NEIL

sees his eyes dart.    Neil glances at his right rear view

mirror.

NEIL'S POV: MAN

with the silenced .22.

WIDE FROM THE FRONT

Neil floors the Caprice and it catapults and bucks over

rows of ramps.

REAR SHOT - MAN

pumps SHOTS into the rear of the Caprice.

INT. CAPRICE - NEIL

Jerks out his 9mm Browning as .22 SLUGS DRILL precise HOLES

THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD.

EXT. DRIVE-IN - VERY WIDE

Neil throws the Caprice through a skidding 180 degree turn

and accelerates toward the man who moves back towards the

Dodge pickup for cover.

INT. PICKUP - DRIVER

Panics now.   The Dodge takes off, abandoning the man with

the .22.

INT. CAPRICE - NEIL'S POV: SKY-GROUND

PITCH BACK AND FORTH, UP AND DOWN.   The Man runs, turns,

stands, and FIRES.

EXT. DRIVE-IN - PROFILE: CAPRICE AND ABANDONED GUNMAN

Who FIRES until the Caprice smashes into him.

INT. CAPRICE - NEIL

Skids around to a stop and bails out.

EXT. DRIVE-IN - DODGE PICKUP

Accelerating to the exit lane, kicking up billows of dust.

INT. PICK-UP - DRIVER'S POV - CLEAR EXIT

Until Cerrito and Chris fold out from either side of the

exit gate with shotguns. They FIRE:

EXT. DRIVE-IN - WIDE

The windshield is blown out and the Driver's half into the

back seat. The car rolls over onto its side. Cerrito

FIRES into the exposed gas tank. It BLOWS UP.

NEIL

approaches the fallen Gunman and with the 9mm.   Browning

at his temple, kicks away the .22.

Neil looks at his smashed, twisted body and bleeding mouth

He's choking to death. Neil shakes his head "no."

He closes his eyes.

NEIL

aims.   FIRES ONCE.

VERY WIDE FROM THE TOP OF THE DRIVE-IN SCREEN - SUNSET

The whole landscape. Neil with      the gun heavy at the end

of his arm walks from the Gunman     to the Caprice. Chris

and Cerrito - like duck hunters     - cradle their shotguns

and cross to a Lincoln away from     the burning pickup.

INT. MALIBU SECURITIES, VAN ZANT OFFICE - VAN ZANT - NIGHT

Phone rings.   Occupied, he casually answers.

Van Zant reacts, racing, trying to cover.

Neil hangs up. Hugh Benny has entered.       Van Zant looks at

the phone, then Hugh:

INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT, PHONE BOOTH - NEIL - NIGHT

Is re-dialing.

INT. KELSO TRAILER - CEZAR KELSO - NIGHT

In his wheelchair.   He checks a meter attached to his

telephone wire.

Starts to hang up.

Kelso does.

INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - NEIL

CLICK.

WIDE ON ROUND TABLE

Michael and Elaine Cerrito, Chris and Charlene, Towner and

his wife ANNA - a striking black woman we'll see later -

sit around the table and sing "Happy Anniversary" to the

tune of "Happy Birthday" as a Chinese waiter brings Elaine

and Michael Cerrito a cake; Neil returns.

Everyone applauds and laughs and raises glasses of plum

wine except Cerrito who drinks club soda. Elaine and

Michael blow out the candles.

The skeleton of a steamed sea bass is in the center of the

table.

INT. MEN'S ROOM OF CHINESE RESTAURANT - CLOSE ON FAUCET -

NIGHT

It's a LOUD TORRENT - TILT UP TO THREE SHOT: Neil, Cerrito

and Chris are clustered around the sink. The water runs

seemingly aimlessly. It also would drown out a bug.

Neil turns off the water and they leave.

INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - PLUM WINE AT TABLE - LATER

Elaine drinks. WIDEN. Michael whispers in her ear. She

smiles. Then she laughs and drapes an arm around his neck

and plants a kiss that almost knocks him over. The party,

winding down. Everyone luxuriates in the afterglow.

CHARLENE AND CHRIS

sedate, comfortable, each in separate thoughts.

They're close for this moment: the afterglow of the dinner.

NEIL

looks at Charlene.

CHARLENE

sees and holds his look and then her attention shifts to

Elaine.

NEIL

checks his watch.     Waiter approaches Neil with the bill.

EXT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - NEIL - NIGHT

And everyone else exits from the restaurant, say their

goodbyes and go to their cars: Neil's Lincoln, Chris's

Seville, Cerrito's Sedan de Ville, Towner to a restored El

Camino. WE HEAR:   BEEP-BEEP-BEEP.

We HEAR a soft FILM ADVANCE and SHUTTER.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL REAR SHOTS of Hanna, Drucker, Casals

and a surveillance team on the roof across the street behind

some neon.

Hanna rolls away from his line of sight and says to his

men:

EXT. EADY'S HOUSE, DECK - TWO SHOT - NIGHT

Neil's shirt's open. Eady's in a terry robe. They've

made love. It's late. They're awake. After a moment:

There's a pause, then:

Neil looks right into Eady's face.

She believes him.   So do we.

INT. SOUTH LA BREA MOTEL - CLOSE ON HOOKER - NIGHT

She's a BLACK PROSTITUTE - all of 18. She looks bored and

chews gum as she puts on a rayon Japanese Kimono and exits.

ANGLE ON BED - WAINGRO

sits on the edge of the rumpled bed in his Jeans. He wears

a neck brace. His face is still swollen and bruised from

Neil's beating. His belt isn't buckled. He's in a daze.

O.S. we HEAR a TOILET FLUSH. Prostitute returns. Waingro

looks over at her:

Waingro winds up and cracks the girl.     She knocks over a

cheap lamp and bounces off a wall.

PROSTITUTE

on her stomach on the floor, dazed. Waingro kicks her and

throws a small table at her. It smashes apart.

INT. MIRACLE MILE BAR - ON WAINGRO - NIGHT

At the bar drinking alone. The logs of an Asian girl dance

Most patrons are Korean. BARTENDER approaches.

BARTENDER

pours and Waingro knocks it back, watches the Asian dancer

and pops a five and a ten to him across the bar.

Bartender writes on a cocktail napkin.

Waingro flips the Bartender a $20.

Another woman takes Waingro's eyes. He spins around on

his bar stool and grabs her arm as she passes. Big smile.

Its...

LILLIAN

Breedan's woman. She, too, is a dancer and her shift's

over. She's wearing a raincoat over tights and a sweatshirt

She jerks her arm away.

Waingro backs way off and shrugs.    Lillian leaves.

INT. LILLIAN'S CAR - LILLIAN - NIGHT

Down the Strip.   The RADIO is on.

Lillian turns right up into the driveway and pulls into

Robert's Coffee Shop.

She asks Solenko who's behind the cash register something,

then leaves, heading across the street to...

INT. NARROW POLYNESIAN BAR - BREEDAN - NIGHT

A back corner, loaded, looks up.

Big drunk smile.   She helps him up and supports his weight.

EXT. POLYNESIAN BAR, TWO SHOT - NIGHT

It's later. Breedan's been sick. Now he's sober. They

sit near trash barrels under a huge plaster half shell,

fishing nets and blue lights.

Lillian stares right at him.

Breedan puts one arm around her waist and they strenuously

rise.

EXT. EMA PRECIOUS METALS, REAR - WIDE ON ALLEY - NIGHT

Nothing. Hold. Then the Pontiac work car cruises     the

alley. It's dark, but we recognize Cerrito driving    with

Neil in the passenger seat. Pontiac does not slow    down at

ERA, keeps going to the end of the block and turns   left.

INT. EMA PRECIOUS METALS, INC. - HANNA - NIGHT

Staked out inside. With him are Schwartz, Casals, Bosko

and two uniformed policemen: BRUCE and BERRYMAN.

Bruce rearranges himself. Hanna shoots him a lock. He

stops fidgeting. Hanna looks at wall clock: 10:30p.M.

EXT. EMA PRECIOUS METALS, REAR ALLEY - PONTIAC

Cruises the alley a second time.    Again, it doesn't stop.

EXT. ADJACENT ROOFTOP - CAPT. JACKSON - NIGHT

And a ten man   SWAT Team are spread out across roofs. The

men wear flack   vests and carry an array of shotguns and

assault rifles   and shotguns. Everybody Is still. CAPT.

JACKSON uses a   periscope to see over the edge:

JACKSON'S POV: ALLEY

Abandoned.

INT. EMA - HANNA'S STAKE-OUT

He clicks off makes a drinking motion to...

HANNA

...who shakes his head "no." He puts a finger over his

lips meaning silence. Hanna looks at the clock. It's

12:03 a.m. Hanna takes a deep breath. He closes and opens

his eyes. They wait.

EXT. ALLEY - WIDE ON ALLEY - LATER

Nothing. Then the Pontiac with its lights off rolls

forward. Chris gets out with a salesman's sample case and

pads down the five steps to the rear entry of the jewelry

store. Chris is in a black suit and sneakers. There are

surgical gloves on his hands. The others stay in the car.

TIGHTER: CHRIS

assembles a heavy lock punch from the black case.      It's

formidable. He nods.

CERRITO

in lineman's gear  is out of the car and he quickly climbs

the telephone pole  like an experienced lineman. The

telephone pole is  next to the roof upon which Jackson and

the SWAT Team are  staked-out.

TOP OF POLE - CERRITO

arrives. He's 18 inches away from 11 cops.       Team nor

Cerrito are aware of each other.

INT. EMA, INC. - HANNA

Neither the SWAT moves his head to ease the strain: A

hearing aid receiver's in hit ear. He looks at his men.

The clock says 1:10 a.m.

Casals, leg convulses. Bruce is the worst. He writhes

with cramped muscles. Bosko's bulk doesn't move.

HANNA

gestures for Bruce to quiet down.

EXT. ALLEY - CERRITO

Maneuvers past P.G.E. gear and opens the GTE junction box.

He hangs a small suitcase over the door with three black

boxes and six alligator clips and starts searching for

pairs of colored wires and bridging the jewelry store's

alarm circuits.

EXT. ROOF - JACKSON

Doesn't know Cerrito is there. He hears BREATHING. He's

curious. He raises his head over the edge and his eyes go

wide. WIDEN. He's inches from the back of Cerrito's head.

Cerrito twists and turns and jerks back in effort - almost

touching Jackson. Cerrito's too absorbed to sense Jackson's

presence. Jackson carefully closes his eyes and sinks

down.

EXT. EMA, INC., REAR ENTRANCE - CHRIS

He gets a nod from Cerrito.   He slams the lock punch with

a cut down sledge hammer.

ECU: DOOR

A I" circle is punched into the steel lock mechanism next

to the cylinder, exposing electrical wiring and magnetic

tumblers and "gates."

ECU: CHRIS' FINGERS

like a cardiac surgeon's, have  a balletic grace as they

manipulate the tumblers so the  groove cut in each one lines

up. As they do, a bar of metal   called the "fence" falls

into the channel created by the  lined-up gates, unlocking

the mechanism.

WIDE: CHRIS

touches the door. It swings - soundlessly - open on its

hinges.  Surprisingly, they now pack up. Neil, Chris and

Cerrito climb into the Pontiac and drive away. The door

was left wide open.

EXT. ROOF - JACKSON

INT. EMA, INC. - ON HANNA

INT. EMA, BASEMENT - WIDE ON VAULT DOOR

Nothing. It's black. Then there's light. Neil's entered.

He illuminates the vault with his penlight.

CHRIS

sets up a heavy drill and tapes a template with drill points

marked to the door.

INT. EMA, INC. - BRUCE

Is in agony. His muscles are cramped - he rolls on the

floor trying to control himself. His head inches up, drops

back.

HANNA

calms Bruce with hand gestures.

WIDE

The clock says 2:00 a.m.

Bruce starts shaking, violently. He twists. His belt

buckle hits the floor. There is the smallest TAP. Hanna

closes his eyes.

INT. BASEMENT - NEIL

Looks up at the ceiling. Down at the floor. He thinks.

Pause. This is the first tire we've heard them speak in

this sequence.

No argument.   Chris puts down his equipment.

They strip off and drop their surgical gloves. Chris  tosses

his shop coat on the floor. Both unpin the lapels of  what

is revealed to be dark suits with shirts underneath.  They

abandon everything. They walk out the back door and  keep

going.

EXT. ROOFTOP - ON JACKSON

ROOFTOP POV: WIDE ON ALLEY BELOW

Neil and Chris enter, approach the Pontiac with Cerrito

behind the wheel.

INT. EMA, INC. - HANNA

For the first time in the last seven minutes we hear a

normal voice. Its LOUD.

EXT. ROOFTOP POV: ON ALLEY BELOW

Neil and Chris are in the Pontiac.   Jackson's men are

poised.

Cerrito pulls away. At the end he turns on his headlights,

signals like a good driver, and turns right.

INT. EMA, INC., FIRST FLOOR - WIDE

Manna snaps off the radio.

Then he pitches the radio in a line drive at Bruce, barely

missing his head.

RADIO

SMASHES into pieces.

EXT. GENERAL LIQUORS, LAS VEGAS - WIDE - DAY

A "Las Vegas Police Department" car pulls to the curb.

Hanna and Schwartz get out and cross the crabgrass, dirt,

and debris-filled forecourt to a cheaply constructed wood

and glass one-story building.

MARCIAN0'S OFFICE - MARCIANO - DAY

Hangs up the phone.    We HEAR the DOOR OPEN.

CLOSER

Hanna rips open Marciano's desk drawer finds a gun, unloads

it, throws it on the floor, finds a small tape recorder,

pops the tape out and tosses it to Schwartz. Then he

flashes a badge at Marciano.

INT. ROBERT'S COFFEE SHOP - NEIL + CHRIS - DAY

in a booth next to the window. Out the window is morning

traffic on Beverly Boulevard. Empty coffee cups say they've

been there a while. They lean close and talk low. Neil's

explosive behind it.

Neil looks over at the cook behind the high counter and

recognizes him.

NEIL'S POV: DAVID BREEDAN

INT. KITCHEN - BREEDAN

Grim, cold, working his ass off on five breakfast orders

simultaneously.

Breedan turns, recognizes Neil and warms as if the sun

rose.

Neil looks out and sees Cerrito.

INT. RESTAURANT - ON BOOTH

Neil slides in.

He doesn't have to say anymore.

No answer.    Chris and Cerrito are thinking.

Chris is surprised.

CERRITO

thinks.   The he shrugs, laughs:

EXT. WILIMINGTON OIL FIELDS - OIL PUMP - DAY

WIDEN. It's a desolate area - empty space. Off in the

distance is a manufacturing plant and a billboard. PAN

LEFT and HOLD on Cerrito's Coupe de Ville. It pulls down

the dirt access road, lurching up and down on its soft

shocks, and raising billows of tan dust. It stops. Neil -

in a gray chamois jacket over a black T-shirt - gets out.

He hasn't shaved in a couple of days. Chris and Michael

Cerrito get out the left side. They walk TO CAMERA and:

VERY LONG SHOT: NEIL, CERRITO AND CHRIS

the three men point. Chris draws a map. Then they climb

back into the sky-blue Cadillac and drive away.

PULL BACK and REVEAL Schwartz with binoculars and Casals

with earphones. They had been surveilling Neil and Cerrito.

There's a tape recorder with a directional microphone in a

parabolic dish.

WIDER

The two men run back from their observation position to an

unmarked car parked a hundred yards behind.

SAME SCENE - WIDE - LATER - SUNSET

It's later. The CAMERA PANS the empty, desolate landscape

of oil pumps, dirt roads and a solitary billboard.

PULL BACK to REVEAL Hanna, Schwartz, Casals and Bosko.

Hanna looks through binoculars.

O.S. we HEAR a CLICK.

ANGLE ON HANNA

Recognition dawns.

Hanna turns his back on the rest of the detectives and a

big smile dawns upon his face. He raises his arms out

wide. Hanna turns in one direction, then another. Schwartz

doesn't understand.

VERY TIGHT ON HANNA IN 3/4 REAR SHOT

The image vibrates. Hanna says more. We don't hear it.

We HEAR a CAMERA SHUTTER CLICK. The IMAGE FOCUSES and

DEFOCUSES. Another CLICK.

Hanna laughs.

EXT. KNOLL - L.S. HANNA - TWILIGHT

Pull back to reveal he's being surveilled by Neil. He's

been photographing Hanna with a black Nikon on a tripod

with a 1300Mm Questar Reflector lens. Neil's made his

tail. The recce in the blue Cadillac was bait. Neil half

returns Hanna's smile. He climbs into the Caprice. Cerrito

roars off, leaving a cloud of dust which billows into mauve

against the deep sky.

EXT. KELSO'S TRAILER - WIDE - NIGHT

Neil comes out with Nate.   Kelso moves in his Wheelchair

and closes the door.

They cross to Nate's Buick and get in.   Neil carries a

large, black sample case.

INT. NATE'S MERCEDES - TWO SHOT - TRAVELING - DAY

Vapor lights glide past. Neil examines circuit diagrams

and architectural blueprints of the bank. Next he unfolds

a pasted-together 180 degree view of the street.

Neil puts the materials back in the case and snaps it shut.

Next, Nate hands Neil a thick envelope. Inside are the

pictures Neil took of Hanna and xeroxes of Hanna's

employment records.

Neil laughs.

INT. VAN ZANT OFFICE - ON VAN ZANT - DAY

He's checking a computer print-out against a ledger sheet.

He looks like he's been sleeping in his clothes. His door

opens. He's startled.

HUGH BENNY

in an iridescent gold suit no tie - sticks his head in.

He breaks the ankles of people who - for the most part -

work for a living and have fallen behind on a juice loan.

He looks the part.

Hugh gestures down the corridor.

WAINGRO

enters.

INT. HANNA CONDO - HANNA - 6:OO P.M.

enters.   he's beat.    He enters kitchen.

INT. KITCHEN - WIDE

It's a mess with dirty dishes stacked in the sink.

No answer.

INT. JUSTINE'S BATHROOM - JUSTINE

Putting on makeup. She's dressed up: short black dress,

fish net stockings.

No answer.    Hanna gets it.

Hanna leaves. Then Justine looks at where he stood. Her

cold demeanor cracks, then reassembles and she lights a

roach, takes a hit, dumps it in the toilet and finishes

her makeup.

INT. KITCHEN - HANNA

starts cleaning dishes in the sink.    A DOOR CLOSES (O.S.).

He pumps Liquid Vel. It suds. Hanna    picks up a plate to

wash it. He looks at it. Pauses.      Then he SMASHES the

plate into the piles of dirty dishes   and rests on his

forearms.

EXT. 405 - TRAFFIC - NIGHT

under the flight path near LAX.    We CRANE DOWN and pick up

Neil's Town Car.

INT. TOWN CAR - NEIL - NIGHT

driving, looks into the rear mirror. FLASHERS hit his car

and a spotlight waves him over. He checks for helicopters.

There are none.

NEIL'S POV: ONE UNMARKED POLICE CAR

This is a routine stop.    It's early evening, rush hour.

NEIL

slips his 9mm.   Browning under his thigh and pulls over.

EXT. 405 SHOULDER - WIDE

Both cars pull onto the shoulder. Out of the unmarked

police car walks Vincent Hanna in jeans and a sweatshirt.

He approaches Neil's car.

NEIL

watches Hanna approach, wary.    He didn't expect this to

happen.

Hanna crosses back to his car.

EXT. FOOD STAND - HANNA + NEIL - NIGHT

at a table. Headlights stream by to and from the airport:

business people, families going on vacations, people living

normal lives who have never used guns to kill people, never

experienced physical violence, some who have never been

stolen from and never steal. Surrounded on all sides by

this flow of normalcy:

The adversarial intensity is eye-to-eye.

Both of these guys look at each other and recognize the

mutuality of their condition. Hanna's light laughter:

They look at each other for a moment.      Neil's wry smile.

INT. HANNA'S OFFICE - HANNA - NIGHT

entering.

Hanna picks up phone to call someone.

All at the same time.   About nine p.m.

Hanna's got no one to call.      He throws the phone at the

wall.

No one does.

EXT. ALLEY - WIDE - NIGHT 1:00A.M.

We see nothing. The alley is black. We HEAR a BUZZ.

ZOOM IN to a figure in black - almost invisible. The BUZZ

becomes an intense TEARING SOUND. At the end of the ZOOM

we realize it's Neil.

CHRIS

opens his satchel and takes out a voltmeter.

INT. BANK - UPPER STORAGE ROOM - WIDE - NIGHT

It's deserted and unlit. We HEAR the SCRAPING NOISE of

Neil and Chris working. SLOWLY ZOOM INTO the upper corner

near the ceiling: A row of large fuse boxes. We ZOOM INTO

the center one. A sign: "Lighting and Alarm Systems"

INT. ROBERT'S COFFEE SHOP - ON NEIL - DAY

He, Cerrito and Chris sit in a back booth. No one says

anything and they wait. There's the monotonous drone of

MUSAK. Neil watches the cook behind the high counter.

ANGLE ON KITCHEN - BREEDAN

Sees Neil and nods.   Neil waves.

Chris looks at the wall clock: 12:30.

SOLENKO

crosses to CASHIER - an old lady with red lipstick.

SOLENKO'S POV: OF NEIL, CHRIS AND CERRITO

in the booth. They're tense. Solenko doesn't know he

ought not to want to mess with them.

INT. KITCHEN - BREEDAN - DAY

flips six eggs on the grill, throws frozen French fries in

the oil, turns bacon, flips pancakes and dumps eight pieces

of bread in the toaster. Solenko enters.

Breedan takes it out on the toaster handles - banging down

each one.

BOOTH - CERRITO

on his fifth coffee, looks up.

TOWNER

crosses through and joins them.     He's tense.

He leaves.

In answer, Neil rises and goes back into the restaurant

kitchen.

INT. KITCHEN - TWO SHOT - DAY

Neil enters.    Breedan turns.

Neil leaves. Breedan rips off his apron. Eggs are burning

on the grill. The toast is smoking - clouds billow.

Sprinklers come on. Breedan couldn't care less.

SOLENKO

races in.

BREEDAN

rolls his apron into a ball and throws it away.

Breedan throws Solenko out of the way.      Solenko slips and

falls into the wet mess on the floor.

INT. TOWNER'S HOUSE KITCHEN - TOWNER'S PICKUP - DAY

approaches, parks. He cuts the engine.       FOOTSTEPS.   Then

Towner enters his living room.

WAINGRO

is revealed leaning against the door jam to the rear

bedroom. He straightens his clothes. A baseball bat rests

against the wall.

He winks. Hugh Benny (from Van Zant's office) rests against

a bamboo bar with a 9mm. Beretta in his waistband.

Hugh crosses to the phone.

Towner looks at Hugh.

HUGH

dialing the phone - stares at Towner with a blank look.

TOWNER

Fear blossoms. He races to the bathroom off the kitchen

from which Waingro entered.

We see Anna's arm on the floor. Waingro's picked up the

baseball bat he rested against the door jamb.

EXT. FIRST COMMERCIAL BANK OF WILMINGTON - TRAVELING PAST

ENTRANCE - DAY

We PAN to HOLD IT. The entrance is on the street.    The

parking lot is on the side.

PULL BACK to REVEAL we're SHOOTING from inside a Mercury

station wagon. Breedan drives. By now   we're WIDE all the

way from behind the rear seat. Cerrito  and Chris sit in

the rear. Ahead, cones block parking in  one slot.

Cerrito hands out women's stockings.     The men rip open the

packages and start to roll them up.

INT. DIVISION HEADQUARTERS, HANNA'S OFFICE - BURGLARY

his tine - stopping for water and the candy bar machines -

enroute to Hanna's office.

INT. MERCURY WAGON - CERRITO - DAY

Breedan at the curb on a residential street off Hawthorne

in view of the bank. Cerrito from a paper bag hands out

three H & K model 53 small machine-guns and gives Breedan

a .45 and two extra clips.

CLOSE SHOTS

Neil, Chris   and Cerrito wear their stubby weapons concealed

under nylon   shell jackets on shoulder straps. They shove

into place   the curved clips, and release the top bolts,

jacking the   first rounds into chambers.

NEIL

checks his watch.

The Mercury wagon pulls from the curb.

CERRITO

checks and he re-checks his gun.

BREEDAN

drives. Cool. Unharrassed. His own ran, performing the

simple and critical task of driving a station wagon and

obeying perfectly every single rule of the California

Vehicle Code.

EXT. - HAWTHORNE AVENUE - MERCURY

APPROACHES CAMERA. Breedan puts on the left turn signal

and for the sign. Hawthorne is crowded with housewives,

women and kids and commercial traffic.

There's a Safeway down from them with afternoon shoppers

and newspaper racks.

INT. HANNA OFFICE - DIETER - DAY

enters.

Casals, bored, looks at the paper and explodes out of his

They look up at clock.

THEIR POV: IT'S 2:43.

Hanna spills his coffee and runs out without his coat.

Casals, Bosko and Schwartz follow.

finger and Dominick grips it like a monkey and she pulls

him up.

ANGLE

She crosses and turns an the TV without volume. A

newscaster appears. Charlene turns her back on the TV.

On all fours, she advances on Dominick. He shrieks and

laughs and crawls away.

INT. BANK - ON STREET DOOR - DAY

Neil and Chris enter the street door. Chris lingers by

the guard. He reads a Rosicrucian handout. They smile at

each other. Neil approaches the window of teller JOHN

FISKE.

ON SIDE DOOR

Cerrito enters and hesitates to tie his shoe near Guard

FRANK MAGID.

NEIL

in line, waits: an old lady finishes and leaves.

Can I borrow your pen, John?

John reaches into the side jacket pocket.

NEIL

pulls his stocking mask down over his face. He reaches

over the counter and grabs smiling John Fiske's lapels and

yanks him over the counter top and throws him across the

floor. Meanwhile:

Magid turns. Cerrito saps him expertly on the right

shoulder, paralyzing his gun arm, spins him and swipes the

sap across his neck. Meanwhile:

CHRIS

has smashed Guard One in the stomach with the H & X -

doubling him up. Now he braces him against the wall,

disarms and handcuffs him. He jerks on his stocking mask.

WIDE - THE BANK

There are two FEMALE TELLERS and four CUSTOMERS. Neil

moves toward the bank Officers at their desks, specifically,

while bringing up his H & K.

TIMMONS

with Neil approaching, frantically stomps the alarm button

under his desk.

FACES

of Tellers and customers. Scared, but Neil's monologue

holds their attention. Throughout he's approaching Timmons.

He smiles.

NEIL

reaches Timmons.

Neil slams a punch into Timmons' face in calculated contrast

to his friendliness. It's an object lesson to customers

of the result of disobeying. Timmons flips backwards over

his chair.

NEIL

hauls him up, rips open his white shirt and pulls the key

an a lariat off his neck.

The white shirt is already splattered with blood.        Customers

watch. They do not want this to happen to them.

CERRITO

pulls a straight razor and leans over Guard Magid. He

slits his pants leg and pocket open and extracts the other

key and it.

PAN 0N KEY

through the air and is caught by Chris.        throws Timmons'

key. PAN it to Chris.

CHRIS

spins the ring handle for five seconds. The massive round

vault door opens. It reveals a second, rectangular door.

CERRITO

handcuffs Magid.    handcuffs Timmons to his chair.

INT. VAULT

Chris inserts both keys, turns them simultaneously and the

second massive door opens inward.

LOW ANGLE: STEEL INNER SANCTUM

Inside is the four-wheel cart and the two large canvas

bags of money. WIDEN TO REVEAL Neil is there as well and

opens the Hefty Garbage bag while Chris whips out an Exacto

blade and slices the canvas bags open to check the contents.

THE CANVAS BAG

disemboweled, spills money. Lots of it.    Chris loads both

into two Hefty bags Neil holds open.

NEIL

tosses one on his shoulder like a sailor's duffle bag, his

machine-gun in front...

EXT. BANK - WIDE FROM FRONT - DAY

Cerrito exited the bank via the side door and now moves

quickly TO CAMERA up the side - his stocking mask off -

his H & K low, concealed.

NEIL

exits the bank through the front door TO CAMERA. The

sidewalk is crowded with school kids now and housewives.

No one pays attention as Neil tosses the first bag to

Cerrito...

INT. HANNA'S CAR - HANNA, SCHWARTZ + BOSKO - DAY

covering the interior. Neil avoids a lady pushing a

supermarket shopping cart, looks up and SEES:

NEIL'S POV: HANNA + SCHWARTZ

entering rapidly but surreptitiously 50 yards down the

sidewalk. Bosko's moving 90 degrees to the right, crossing

the street. There would be no, there was no, and there

never is any, warning. Neil Hanna and Schwartz with 12-

gauges OPEN FIRE. World War III ERUPTS. Now we hear

distant POLICE SIRENS.

CHRIS

is hit in the neck.

NEIL'S

FIRING 3-SHOT BURSTS that blow up Schwartz and a lamppost

and hit a woman who falls over her shopping cart, shrieking.

Hanna's behind the lamppost.

BOSKO

across the   street with his AR-180, opens up on the station

wagon which   takes HITS. A  BLACK AND WHITE slides sideways

and COP #1   with a shotgun runs across the street hollering

at kids who   stop and stare and drop school books.

CERRITO

over the station wagon roof FIRES a BURST at Bosko, then

swings onto Cop #1 and fires, killing him. Cerrito jumps

into the wagon.

THE STREET - WIDE: A BUS

The driver panics and slams on his brakes and his bus full

of people stalls in the combat zone between Bosko and the

wagon.

NEIL

shielded by the green bag of money which has taken hits,

FIRES at Hanna and backs to Chris.

HANNA

pulls Schwartz to cover.

CHRIS

dazed - holding his bleeding neck while Neil FIRES into

the parking lot...

down as if stunned.

MAN

pulling his car out of the lot ducks behind the wheel and

crashes it into a parked car.

EXT. BANK - CERRITO

Neil can't rake it through the incoming FIRE from Hanna

and Cop #2 to the station wagon and Cerrito and knows it.

ON STATION WAGON

Breedan floors it.

HANNA

re-emerges, kneels and PUMPS SHOTS into the station wagon.

BOSKO

rounds the bus with the AR-180 and OPENS UP

STATION WAGON

draws everyone's FIRE.    Breedan ducks and pilots it through

the gauntlet.

NEIL

has taken off down the sidewalk, supporting Chris. TIGHTEN.

He runs in among crowds of civilians. He knocks over a

man, breaks through. People are screaming, staring,

shocked.

INT. STATION WAGON - BREEDAN

getting BLOWN APART by Hanna, Bosko, and Cop #2 falls over

the wheel and then is thrown back.

It spins across the street on steel rims and crashes

sideways into a parked car on the east side of Hawthorne.

INT. STATION WAGON - CERRITO

shot three times, holds his abdomen and bails, returning

FIRE. Breedan, like a rag doll is half over into the rear

Breedan. He's dead.

EXT. SIDE STREET - CERRITO

east up a side street past people who stand on their lawns

and stare - traumatized.

WIDER

Bosko and Cop #3 chase Cerrito. Cerrito FIRES a long BURST.

They can't fire back because of the people.

EXT. SAFEWAY - TRACKING NEIL + CHRIS - DAY

manner of pedestrians, newspaper coin boxes, fruit vendors

and parking meters. People dodge, scream and fall down.

It's chaos.

TRACKING HANNA

a half block behind, chasing Neil - pushing through the

same people.

EXT. SAFEWAY PARKING LOT - NEIL + CHRIS

Neil - supporting Chris - throws a lady, who was getting

out, back into her Olds Cutlass. He dumps Chris and the

money in the back seat and turns on Hanna.

NEIL

extends the collapsible stock braces on the roof for

accuracy and FIRES over the roof of other cars and through

people at Hanna closing in 5o yards away.

EXT. SAFEWAY - HANNA + CIVILIANS

who panic. SHOOTING. Windows EXPLODE. A lady holds her

ears and shrieks. A newspaper coin box SHATTERS. A man's

bag of groceries explode milk and eggs everywhere. He

goes down.

HANNA

doesn't have a clear shot and drops, dragging people down

with him.

NEIL

behind the wheel - burns rubber pulling out of the lot

over curbstones and through a fence into the alley.

EXT. ALLEY - WIDE

Suddenly Neil drives very normally and jerks the lady

upright next to him like a wife. He drives away.

HANNA

runs to the alley - pulling his radio:

No response. Dead batteries. He throws the radio at the

Safeway wall: SMASH. And runs up the alley. Meanwhile:

EXT. SIDE STREET - WIDE - DAY

Cerrito runs TO CAMERA through kids playing in a front

yard, looking over his shoulder at Drucker and Bosko who

can't fire because of the kids.

CERRITO

up a girl out of the yard.

She's the   same age as his own daughters. He holds her to

his chest   with one arm as a shield against Drucker and

Bosko. He    FIRES a wild THREE SHOT BURST running up the

sidewalk.    Meanwhile:

EXT. ALLEY - HANNA

emerges,   cuts right. He brings up his 9mm. Smith and

Wesson.    He slows. He stops. Hear his BREATHING. WIDEN

and PAN   AROUND. Cerrito is running right at Hanna and

doesn't   see him.

OVER HANNA'S SHOULDER: CERRITO'S

attention on Drucker and Bosko. Cerrito FIRES. The little

girl sees Hanna because he's aiming the 9mm. directly at

her with both hands. She stares into his eyes.

CERRITO

turns, sees Hanna. He starts swinging around the H & K on

its shoulder strap..

HANNA

FIRES ONCE.

WIDE - CERRITO

is hit dead center in the forehead and topples backwards

like a felled oak. The little girl falls half on and off

his dead chest, screaming.

WIDE - HANNA, DRUCKER + BOSKO

get to Cerrito simultaneously.      Bosko pulls the girl up

and turns her away.

BOSKO

takes the girl and folds her into his bear-like chest. He

carries her off. He holds onto her and wraps his jacket

around her. Tears stream down his face.

HANNA

standing there in the center of the mess: bodies, disabled

vehicles, people, shouting, SIRENS arriving, etc.

INT. DR. BOB'S DOG AND CAT HOSPITAL SURGERY - CHRIS - DAY

a white coat and bald head, works on him. DOGS BARK O.S.

from the kennels.

A CLAMP CLATTERS into the bowl. Chris moans in a dry rasp

and convulses. Bob motions to Neil to hold Chris'

shoulders.

NEIL

holds Chris down.

With one hand Neil gives Bob a tray of syringes.

WIDE - THE SURGERY

Bob's back obscures a series of injections into Chris'

neck and shoulder.

It's a veterinarian surgery and the metal table Chris is

Spent syringes CLATTER into pans.

ELAINE CERRITO

knocks over a Uniformed Cop and runs down the sidewalk to

the chalked outline of Cerrito's body on the cement and

lawn.

CLOSER

Another cop moves to stop her. She dodges him. Disheveled,

screaming, hysterical - she throws herself on the bloodied

ground Michael Cerrito died upon and clutches at the outline

drawing of his body and blood stains as if it were him.

NEWS CAMERAMAN

rings up a sale, changing a $20.

Lillian waits. Behind and above her the Newscaster cuts

from Last coast storms to coverage of the bank robbery

aftermath: bullet holes in windows, Cerrito's body,

Breedan's body, etc.

LILLIAN

sees none of it.   Then: impatient:

More robbery aftermath plays across the screen.

BARTENDER

at end of bar. Finishes with the customer.       On his way to

Lillian he turns up the TV volume.

As the bartender reaches her - WIDEN TO INCLUDE Lillian.

She stares at the television - stunned - at seeing David's

She stares at the TV and holds onto the deep polished grain

of the bar.

WIDE

Neil FLASHES his penlight around the room.      Nothing.

INT. TOWNER BEDROOM - DOOR

It opens silently. Neil's cautious, sweeping his .45 into

wallet with money and scattered clothes. It means they

haven't split.

INT. TOWNER KITCHEN - LOW

Neil - cautiously - enters. Nothing.      O.S. we HEAR WATER

RUNNING from another room. TIGHTEN.

Neil works his way to the SOUND.     He crosses to the bathroom

off the kitchen.

through the crack in the door. He starts to push it open.

Something blocks it. The water SOUNDS are LOUDER. Neil

shines his light INTO CAMERA.

NEIL'S POV: WIDE - ON THE FLOOR

Towner is near death, beaten to a pulp. Something or

someone is in the shower stall. Blood's all over.

ANOTHER ANGLE

Neil uses his penlight. He puts a towel under Towner's

head. Towner's face - against the white octagonal tile

floor - is a mess. He opens his eyes. TILT UP to Neil.

Neil crosses to the shower stall and looks in.    He comes

back to Towner.

Coughs and shakes his head.    He doesn't remember the name.

Neil thinks. Then:

Towner nods his head.

Neil can't get a straight answer.

Towner nods.

PAN RIGHT with Neil.    He turns off the water in the sink

and leaves.

four cops - including Cop $4 and Cop #5   - carrying flack

vests and M-16's. As they confer about    positioning...

INT. SECOND FLOOR APARTMENT - CHARLENE - FIGHT

enters and sees Marciano already there.    Surprised:

Marciano does. Charlene seems to soften and relax and

take satisfaction at Marciano's put-down.

Charlene rises and crosses to a bedroom and looks in the

door - presumably at Dominick.

Charlene sits - shell-shocked - dressed in black with white

face and red lipstick. Marciano re-enters with a drink

Dominick, then nods her head "yes." Farina dials a number.

Charlene dials a number into the regular phone.   Then:

Ralph sees Hanna's 2" .38 in his waistband.

Hanna's reaction to Ralph is vacant of emotion.

In the background Eady turns on the radio and watches Neil

Neil hangs up and turns to Eady.    He stands there.    He

nods.

Eady looks away.

NEIL

her loose.

barely restrain Lauren who has the strength of someone in

a psychotic episode.

EXT. CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL - BLACK AND WHITE - DAY

Code 3, pulls up and Justine runs out and sees:

JUSTINE'S POV: HANNA CARRYING LAUREN

out of a police ambulance wrapped in a towel like a baby.

His face is scratched and bleeding.

She struggles, but bent double in his arms, she's

immobilized. Attendants rush at them with a stretcher

with restraining belts. Hanna shoulders them aside and

races into emergency.

INT. EMERGENCY CORRIDOR - TRACKING HANNA WITH LAUREN AS

JUSTINE - DAY

catches up.

Lauren relaxes in his arms, carried like a baby; and tears

stream down her face.

JUSTINE

one arm locked around Hanna - trying to see her daughter.

Then Lauren goes wild again and Hanna tightens.

HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - HANNA + JUSTINE - LATER

his arm around her.    She leans back against him.

She shrugs. Then she moves closer to him and be pulls her

into his shoulder.

INT - MERCEDES - NEIL + EADY - NIGHT

Neil drives.   He's pensive.   He sees the "Hyatt" sign.

Neil KILLS THE RADIO.

He turns the RADIO BACK ON.

The Mercedes is in the left. Suddenly Neil pulls across

three lanes and shoots up an offramp - fast. Neil checks

his watch.

EXT. HYATT HOUSE HOTEL - WIDE ON FRONT - NIGHT

A lot of traffic and lights. Neil drives the Mercedes

past the front and turns left at the corner into a dark

side street on the side of the hotel. He parks.

NEIL

crossing the street in his dark suit towards the hotel's

side entrance.

He waves without looking.

Some employees exit.

INT. OFFICE - ON PAINTERS - NIGHT

Two house PAINTERS and all their gear are in an empty office

in front of a big picture window. Out the picture window

across the street is the Hyatt House. They're not painting.

They're playing gin on a cardboard box. Maybe they're on

their break.

CLOSE ON ONE PAINTER

He has a Nite vision light accumulater scope and looks

across at the hotel.

PAINTER ONE'S POV: STREET + MERCEDES

with Eady, exiting employees and Neil slips in the side

door.

PAINTER ONE

pans his scope up the hotel.

PAINTER ONE'S POV: ROOM 1403 + WAINGRO

across the way.   He watches TV with his feet up.

PAINTERS

are police - Waingro's surveillance team.

INT. LOCKER ROOM - NEIL - NIGHT

crosses to a desk and red wall phone near some lockers.

The place is abandoned.

Neil starts ransacking the lockers.

EXT. HOTEL - EADY - NIGHT

in the Mercedes. Waiting. She stares at something strange.

WIDEN: it's her hand. It spasms. She grabs onto the

steering wheel to make it stop.

HOTEL LOCKER ROOM - NEIL'S

found a Hyatt security uniform.   He puts on the short jacket

and San Brown belt and hat.

INT. HYATT HOUSE, LOBBY - SERVICE DOOR: NEIL - NIGHT

enters and crosses to the elevators.   He glances to his

left.

NEIL'S POV: DESK CLERK

talks on his police radio.   TILT DOWN.   A 9mm.   Beretta is

under the counter top.

NEIL

continues to the elevators. It says he KNOWS Waingro is a

trap. He knows the LAPD are here. He's come for him

anyway.

INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - NEIL'S HAND - NIGHT

punches 14. PAN AROUND to Neil. The elevator rises. He

pulls his .45 and checks that there's a round in the

chamber. He slips it back into his waistband, cocked and

locked.

INT. HOTEL, 14TH FLOOR ELEVATOR LOBBY - DOORS - NIGHT

slide open. Neil emerges. He does two things. He wedges

the ash tray to hold open the elevator door. Then, he

smashes the glass and sets off the fire alarm. Immediately

a SIREN SOUNDS. The building's elevators - except Neil's

descend. We HEAR:

INT. APARTMENT - ON PAINTERS - NIGHT

Painter One looks through the scope. He looks down at the

ninth floor and laughs. Then he looks away and sees

something else:

PAINTER TWO'S POV: ROOM

Waingro goes to a drawer, pulls out a gun and starts towards

the door.

INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - HANNA WITH JUSTINE

Hanna crosses to the nurse's station.    TIGHTEN.   He answers:

JUSTINE

watching Hanna, heard the conversation.

HANNA

rejoins her and takes her hand. He looks at her and then

at the floor. He puts an around her.

As he's rising.

HANNA

walking backwards, facing her, nods "yes." The last thing

in the world he wants to do is leave. Then he turns and

starts running down the white marble corridor...

INT. 14TH FLOOR CORRIDOR - NEIL - NIGHT

in the hotel security uniform approaches against the flow

of people leaving the floor. The emergency LIGHTING is on

and the PA fire alarm message still SOUNDS. Neil taps his

flashlight on the doors of 1404, 1405 and 1406 as well as

1403.

INT. ROOM 1403 - WAINGRO - NIGHT

looks through the peep hole.

WAINGRO'S POV: NEIL'S BACK AND CORRIDOR

A few patrons exit past the uniformed Neil.     It looks

legitimate.

INT. 14TH FLOOR HALLWAY - DOOR TO 1403

opens silently, half-way.

NEIL

looks inside.   Waingro's obviously hidden behind the door

WIDE

Neil kicks the door and...

INT. 1403 - DOOR

smashes into Waingro. Neil hits the door again and it

smashes into waingro a second time.

NEIL

reaches around, grabs Waingro by the arm, dislocates his

shoulder, breaks his collarbone and throws him across the

room. Waingro's gun goes flying.

WAINGRO

on the sofa, seeing Neil McCauley. He feels his internal

organs drop through the floor. He looks away.

LOW + WIDE

Waingro won't look at Neil.

Waingro, pathetically, obeys and looks up.      Neil's .45

EXPLODES TWICE.

CLOSER: NEIL

now looks out the window, searching.

NEIL'S POV: HIGH RISE ACROSS THE STREET + "PAINTER" TWO

staring at Neil through the Nite vision scope, disbelieving.

Neil sees "Painter" One is shouting into his police radio...

INT. 1403 - NEIL'S

surprised not at all. He expected the police. He turns

away from the window, looks once at Waingro and leaves the

room.

INT. MERCEDES - EADY - NIGHT

twisted in her seat, trying to see, frightened by the noise

and sirens. WIDEN. An L.A.P.D. fire engine ROARS in.

Now an unmarked car skids into the driveway. Drucker,

Bosko and others spill out carrying shotguns. A black and

white parks perpendicular to the traffic flow and halts

cars. She's worried, confused.

INT. ROOM 1403 - WAINGRO - NIGHT

dead iN sitting position on the sofa with his head back as

if he fell asleep watching the football game.

INT. HANNA'S UNMARKED CAR - HANNA - NIGHT

cruising scanning the streets.    He's aggressively searching

for something.

On their way.   You want a command center in the...

For some reason Hanna's disinterested. He's moving down a

different track. He's cruising the streets looking for

something else.

HANNA'S POV: SIDE STREETS

adjoining the hotel are cluttered with emergency vehicles,

cars, pedestrians, on-lookers, service people from adjoining

buildings.

HANNA

trying to see through, past, around everything.    We don't

know what it is he's looking

HANNA'S POV: FIRE ENGINE, AMBULANCE, MERCEDES, BLACK AND

WHITE...

Then Hanna's P.O.V. PANS LEFT back to the Mercedes. The

woman waiting in the passenger seat. It is Eady. She's a

block down. A woman waiting...in a car...alone.

CLOSER: HANNA

It's what he was looking for.

EXT. STREET - WIDE

Hanna is out of the car in the jammed street, running

towards Eady and the Mercedes a block away.

EXT. HOTEL, SIDE DOOR - NEIL

emerges and APPROACHES CAMERA.    In the foreground is Eady

in the Mercedes.

CLOSER: NEIL

calm, assured, approaches the car for the short drive to

the airport. Then, Neil senses and...

SIDE ANGLE: NEIL

turns and looks over his left shoulder.

NEIL'S POV: VINCENT HANNA

a half block away, running through vehicles and incoming

on-lookers right at him.

NEIL MCCAULEY

stops.    He turns to Eady.

EADY

looks at him, quizzically.

HANNA

running towards Neil and Eady.

EADY

climbing out of the Mercedes, now, confused...

NEIL

starting to leave, moving at an oblique angle.     Looking at

her ... leaving her ...

EADY

next to the Mercedes. Shouting at Neil. We can't hear

what she says. SIRENS and NOISE of an ambulance.

HANNA

AMBULANCE pulls in front of him, blocks him. He's around

it, pushing a news crew out of the way, stops.

MERCEDES WITH EADY

in the street.    Alone.   No Neil.

HANNA

spins around, searching.

HIGH + WIDE: HANNA

in the sea of people and vehicles, crossing drivewaYs and

landscaping. Hanna - against the tide - moving away from

the crime scene and police barricades to neighboring

buildings.

FRONTAL: HANNA

through the crowd, searching.     People pushed aside so he

can see. Then...

HANNA POV: THROUGH OFFICE BUILDING LOBBY TO REAR PARKING

LOT

A figure is running between cars. Beyond are the lights

of an L1011 ten feet off the ground about to touch down.

EXT. RUNWAY APRON - L1011 - NIGHT

ROARING through the frame. Reveal Neil jumping a     fence

and running across the grass between power units    and the

racks of lights strobing their arrow sequence at    the head

of the runway. Beyond is Sepulveda Boulevard and     normal

traffic.

NEIL

running towards us.

EXT. RUNWAY - L1011

it's landing gear down, its lights blasting into the lens

fills the frame as it descends to the runway. It wipes

out the strobe racks in a chaotic blast of xenon.

EXT. RUNWAY APRON - LONG SHOT:

HANNA

runs across the grass between the fence to the strobe

lights.

CLOSER: HANNA

among the   structures housing the ballasts for the lights.

The ROAR   of a 757's 95,000 lbs. of thrust beats an him.

He spins   to protect his face. His clothes and hair are

whipped.    As he runs to us ...

CLOSER: HANNA

looks up..

HANNA POV: UP INTO LIGHTS SEARCHING FOR NEIL. SUDDENLY:

NEIL (SLO MO)

is there. His .45 is up, centered into Hanna's face.

He's eight feet away, framed against the glaring racks of

strobes.

NEIL'S HAND (SLO MO)

squeezing the trigger, both eyes over the front sight,

moving laterally on target through the liquid air and

lights...

NEIL'S .45 (SLO MO)

as the trigger's squeezed and the sear's released and...

MACRO: THE .45's HAMMER (SLO MO) falling.

HANNA (SLO MO)

coming up with his 9mn.    He's too late...

NEIL

The hammer drops.    Nothing.   His .45 misfires.

HANNA (SLO MO)

His 9mm.    coming up...

NEIL'S HAND (SLO MO)

swipes across the .45's slide.

MACRO: THE BREECH OF NEIL'S .45 (SLO MO)

The misfired round, ejected and spinning away. The new

round, moving forward, the slide returning to battery...

HANNA

FIRES THREE perfectly controlled, hammered-on SHOTS.     His

front sight barely moved.

NEIL

HIT THREE TIMES in the chest - is blown back into the racks

of lights. He lies still.

HANNA

approaches, slowly.    His gun hand drops to his side.

WIDE: NEIL + HANNA

Neil's   on the ground, his back against the rack. One arm

is in   his lap. The other is flung over the top bar of the

strobe   rack. Neil looks at Hanna and gestures with his

hand.    Hanna takes it. Neil holds on tight.

NEIL

last breath.

Then Neil's eyes dim.    And he dies.

LONG REAR SHOT: HANNA + NEIL

Neil's head has fallen onto his shoulder. Hanna still

grips his hand and looks down the runway into the west at

the lines of blue runway lights like rivers. The two of

them stay there like that.
