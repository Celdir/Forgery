Patriot - 1998 Draft

FADE IN:

CREDITS OVER:

EXT.  SOUTH CAROLINA COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

Woodlands.  Beautiful.  Untamed.  Soaring old-growth elms

arch over riverside maples along the shores of the gently

curving, deep-water Santee River.

SUPERIMPOSITION:

Upstream, the swamps.  Beautiful.  Hundreds of BIRDS SING.

Shafts of sunlight pierce the canopy, cutting through the

hanging moss and kudzu, falling onto soft, swaying ferns

covering the high ground.

The water is clear, with fields of floating lily pads,

each with a stark white flower rising from it.

SUPERIMPOSITION:

EXT.  POND BLUFF - DAY

A farm built between the banks of the river and the deep

green of the swamps.  Good, fertile land, hacked out of

the wilderness.

The perfectly tended fields are ripe with barley, hops,

alfalfa and tobacco.  Two sturdy brothers, NATHAN, 13 and

SAMUEL, 12, work one of the fields, rhythmically swinging

scythes through the barley.

The house, built of native brick, is well-constructed and

well-maintained.  There's a barn, a workshop and a forge.

It is a home of substance rather than wealth.  On the

front porch, MARGARET, 11, pumps a butter churn while her

brother, WILLIAM, 6, watches.

GABRIEL, 18, strong and handsome, walks out of the woods

with a musket in his hand and a dozen game-birds over his

shoulder.  At his side walks THOMAS, 14, also carrying a

musket.

INT.  WORKSHOP - DAY

A perfect colonial workshop, fastidiously arranged with

every conceivable tool of the period.  A foot-powered

lathe.  A drop-forge.  A lifting saw.  Racks of tools,

planes, hammers, augers, drills, blocks, all hanging in

their places.  All very well-worn.

FRANCIS MARION methodically works his lathe, turning a

piece of hardwood, shaving off tiny curls of wood with a

razor-sharp chisel.  He's in his late-forties, strong and

weathered.  His hands, though big and callused, handle the

chisel with a surgeon's precision.  Self-educated and

self-sufficient, he has built himself, as he built his

farm, brick by brick, from the coarse clay of the earth.

A finely-made rocking chair, missing only the dowel on

which Marion is working, sits on the work table.  The

chair is a work of art, thin and light, a spider-web of

perfectly turned wood, no nails, no glue.

Sitting on the woodpile, SUSAN, 4, a silent, stone-face

wisp of a child, watches her father.

Marion takes the piece of wood out of the lathe, carefully

fits it into the chair, inserts a peg and taps it into

place.  Then he steps back and appraises his handiwork.

He picks up the chair and hooks the top rail to a scale,

countering with a three-pound weight.  The chair floats.

Marion blows softly on the weight which sinks.  Susan

nods, so far, so good.  Marion puts the chair on the floor

and walks slowly around it, checking every angle.

Then, the acid test.  He takes a deep breath and lowers

himself onto the seat, gingerly adding an ounce at a time.

Not a creak.  He smiles and sits back with a sigh.

CRACK!  THE CHAIR SPLINTERS under Marion's weight, DUMPING

HIM on his ass on a pile of broken wood.

He picks up some of the wood, about to fling it across the

room but stops as Susan shoots him a disapproving look.

He calms himself.

Susan gets down from the woodpile and puts the remains of

the chair in the fireplace.  As she climbs back up to her

perch, Marion steps over to his wood rack, extracts a

fresh dowel, fits it into the lathe and starts all over

again.

END CREDITS.

EXT.  WORKSHOP - DUSK

Marion leaves the workshop with Susan at his side.  Nathan

and Samuel walk past, exhausted from their day in the

field.

Marion walks on without waiting for a reply from his

contrite sons who jostle one another, trying to pass off

the blame.  Gabriel and Thomas walk out of the barn.

Marion nods and motions for Susan to go with Gabriel and

Thomas to the house.  She does so and Marion walks on

alone toward:

EXT.  HILLTOP - POND BLUFF - SUNSET

The loveliest spot on the farm.  A beautiful view of the

house, barns, river, fields and hills beyond.  A

gravestone stands in the shade of a single apple tree.  It

reads:

Above her name is a carving of the night sky, at the

center of which is the NORTH STAR, steady and guiding.

Marion approaches.  He gives himself a moment to look at

the grave, then he starts picking apples, speaking to the

gravestone in a quiet voice that is more matter-of-fact

than sorrowful.

A soft wind blows some dry leaves along the ground.

Marion pauses as if listening to a spoken reply.

Marion pauses, remembering.  The CRASH OF A PLATE

BREAKING, followed by the SOUND OF AN ARGUMENT rises from

the house below.  Marion shakes his head with an

exasperated sigh.

He heads down the hill toward the house, now glowing from

the lights of candles and oil lamps.

INT.  MARION'S HOUSE - EVENING

Pre-dinner chaos.  Everyone talking at once.  Marion's

seven children and his two family servants, ABIGAIL and

AARON, a middle-aged black couple, prepare dinner.  Susan

silently watches from the stairs.  Marion walks in.

Marion hands the apples to Abigail and steps over to open

his mail and dispatches.

Marion hands a packet of pamphlets to Gabriel and opens a

letter.

Marion's children go wild.

The children ERUPT INTO CHEERS and THUNDER into the dining

room.

Marion and Gabriel exchange a stone-faced look.  Then

Marion puts on a smile and inhales deeply.

Marion follows his children into the dining room.

EXT.  MARION'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Quiet.  The only sounds are the soft calls of a few

NIGHTBIRDS and the DRONE OF CICADAS.  A faint light moves

through the downstairs, passing windows in the otherwise

dark house.

INT.  MARION'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Marion, holding a candle, does a father's bedtime check.

The CAMERA FOLLOWS him as he makes his rounds into:

THE KITCHEN.  Everything is clean and put away in its

proper place.

THE MAIN HALLWAY.  Marion checks that the doors are closed

and bolted.  He heads up the stairs.

INT.  BOYS' BEDROOM - NIGHT

Marion enters, finding William asleep on the floor and

Nathan and Samuel in bed.  He lifts William into bed,

takes a slingshot from Nathan's hand, tucks in Samuel and

walks out.

INT.  GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT

Marion steps to the doorway, finding Margaret and Susan at

the window, looking up at the night sky.

Susan gazes up at the North Star.  The girls notice Marion

and climb into bed.  He puts a chair against Susan's bed

and kisses her.  He pulls a blanket up around Margaret,

who whispers:

Marion nods with a thin smile, kisses Margaret and walks

out.

INT.  MARION'S STUDY - NIGHT

Squadrons of lead soldiers stand ready for battle as

Thomas, lying on the floor, deploys his men.  Gabriel

reads the new pamphlets and broadsides.  Marion walks in

and pours a drink.  Gabriel hands several of the pamphlets

to his father.

Marion shakes his head and sits down, carefully extracting

a delicate pair of reading glasses from a wooden box.  He

begins reading.

Marion hears but doesn't respond.  Thomas looks up from

his lead soldiers.

Gabriel and Thomas wait for a reaction.  There is none.

Gabriel goes back to reading and Thomas resumes playing

with his toy soldiers.  Marion's eyes drift from the page

to Gabriel.

EXT.  SWAMP ROAD - DAY

The Marion family, in two tightly-packed carriages, drives

on a beautiful road, cut through the swamps.  The canopy

of swamp maples and weeping willows forms a tunnel of

green, mottled by sunlight.

EXT.  BENNINGTON OVERLOOK - DAY

The two carriages pass a view of their entire valley.

Scattered farms with a patchwork of cultivated fields

surrounding the town of Bennington.

EXT.  SANTEE ROAD - DAY

Passing through rolling farmland, the Marions head toward

the coast.  They pass a large contingent of South Carolina

Militia, drilling in a field.  The children, particularly

Gabriel, watch avidly.

EXT.  CHARLESTON - DAY

A big, bustling city.  Marion and Gabriel negotiate the

carriages through the busy streets.  The children watch,

wide-eyed, seeing taverns, a public gallows, drunkards,

street entertainers, well-dressed ladies attended by their

maids, food venders, a man with a trained bear.

EXT.  CHARLOTTE'S HOUSE - CHARLESTON - DAY

Grand.  Four stories.  Marion and his children pull up.

CHARLOTTE MOTTE hurries out.  She's in her mid-thirties,

beautiful, with a deep sadness that she keeps hidden as

best she can.

The children leap from the carriages and swarm around her,

embracing her, smothering her with kisses.

Charlotte hustles the children toward the door.

Charlotte sweeps past Marion who smiles and follows her

into the house.

INT.  PARLOR - CHARLOTTE'S HOUSE - DAY

Marion watches as Charlotte finishes handing out presents.

Susan plays with a new doll.  William has half-a-dozen new

spinning tops, skimming around the floor.  Margaret holds

a new dress up to herself.  Samuel, Nathan and Thomas tear

into packages holding platoons of lead soldiers.  Gabriel

looks through a new book.

Charlotte sees Marion watching her, rises and joins him at

the doorway.

Suddenly Thomas and Samuel race through the doorway,

forcing Marion and Charlotte together, their bodies close.

They step back and exchange warm but uneasy smiles.

The moment is broken by the SOUND OF CHILDREN.  Marion and

Charlotte gratefully turn their attention back to them.

EXT.  CHARLESTON SQUARE - NIGHT

Down the block from the Motte house.  A yelling crowd of

Sons of Liberty is massed around a Liberty Tree from which

hang dozens of glowing lanterns.  Most of the men in the

crowd are drunk.  Vendors sell rum, ale, food and banners

emblazoned with a coiled snake and the legend, "Don't

Tread On Me."  Scores of on-lookers, including respectable

people, as well as street urchins, whores and drunkards,

watch the proceedings.

Several Sons of Liberty string up effigies of King George

III and Governor Wilmington.  They light the effigies on

fire.  As they begin to blaze, the crowd cheers.

EXT.  CHARLOTTE'S BALCONY - NIGHT

Marion's children, except Gabriel, stand on the balcony

watching the mob.  Marion steps out onto the balcony.

The children turn to Marion with stricken expressions.

Marion relents.

The children turn back to the mob.  Marion joins them.

They see Gabriel making his way through the crowd.  He

sees them and waves, then enters the house.

A moment later Charlotte steps out onto the balcony and

sees:

IN THE SQUARE, a pair of drunk Sons of Liberty, pull down

one of the smoldering effigies, cut off its head, then

start hacking at it's groin with a sword.

Appalled, Charlotte shoots a glare at Marion and snaps at

the children.

The children start to protest, but a glance at Charlotte's

resolute expression makes them think better of it.  They

file into the house.  Charlotte shoots a glare at Marion

and shoos the children inside.  Gabriel steps out and

joins them.

Marion nods thoughtfully without revealing what he thinks

of Lee's expectations.  Marion turns back to watch the

mob.

EXT.  ASSEMBLY HALL - CHARLESTON - DAY

The capital building of South Carolina.  A large crowd of

lower-class men and women is massed in front of the

Assembly Hall.  As well-dressed Assemblymen walk into the

building, the CROWD YELLS words of encouragement to some

and berates others.

In the square in front of the Assembly Hall a squadron of

blue-uniformed AMERICAN CONTINENTAL SOLDIERS drills.  A

recruiting table is being set up by a Continental Captain

and several military clerks.

Marion and Gabriel walk across the square toward the

Assembly Hall.  As they push their way through the crowd,

Gabriel eyes the Continentals.

INT.  ASSEMBLY HALL - DAY

Two dozen ANGRY, YELLING, MEN OF PROPERTY.  Among them are

ROBINSON, HAMILL and JOHNSON, who are Patriots.  Opposed

to them are SIMMS, WITHINGTON and BALDRIDGE who are

Loyalists (loyal the the King).  As Marion makes his way

to his seat, the SPEAKER OF THE ASSEMBLY POUNDS HIS GAVEL.

Slowly, the room quiets down.

The ROOM ERUPTS.

The ROOM SETTLES DOWN.

An imposing figure rises and makes his way to the front of

the assembly.  He's COLONEL HARRY LEE, about Marion's age

and cut from the same cloth -- strong, weathered, with a

powerful bearing.  The room quiets down.

Lee sees Marion and offers a familiar nod, which Marion

returns, stone-faced.  Then Lee speaks, simply and

clearly.

Robinson, one of the Patriots, stands up.

Laughter.  Marion rises.

Laughter from the Loyalists.  Surprise from Lee and the

Patriots.  In the gallery, Gabriel winces.

More laughter.

Laughter.

Marion grows more serious.

The room is quiet, the Assemblymen having been thrown off-

balance.  Gabriel is stunned and disappointed by his

father's speech.

Marion glares at Robinson, then smiles.

Robinson looks derisively at Marion.

Marion bristles but before he can answer, Lee steps in.

Lee's oratorical skills peter out.

Marion and Lee drop all formality and become nothing more

than two old friends, pissed off.

The Speaker POUNDS HIS GAVEL.

The Speaker POUNDS HIS GAVEL again.

Marion and Lee ignore the speaker.

The astonished Assemblymen and now even the Speaker watch

the argument avidly, turning their heads in simultaneous

anticipation of each rejoinder.

Marion speaks slowly and firmly.

Lee says nothing for a moment, then he speaks more

seriously, quietly, grimly.

Marion is silent for a long moment.  He softens, finds

himself unsteady and speaks far more honestly than he ever

wanted to.

Lee is stunned by Marion's honesty and his show of

weakness.  At first Lee has no answer, then:

The other Assemblymen, both Patriots and Loyalists, stare

at him, appalled.  Marion, feeling weak, sits down.  Lee

looks at his friend with more sympathy than

disappointment.  Then Lee turns to Robinson who addresses

the chair.

The vote is taken on a roll call.  Gabriel watches from

the gallery.

No response.

In the gallery Gabriel turns and walks out.  The roll call

continues.  Marion sits, eyes straight ahead.

EXT.  ASSEMBLY HALL - DAY

The crowd waits.  The doors open and a PAGE BOY dashes out

and runs to the Continental Captain at the recruiting

table.

The Continental Captain motions to an assembled squadron.

They raise their muskets and FIRE A VOLLEY into the air.

Other soldiers, STRIKE UP A MARTIAL AIR ON FIFES AND

DRUMS.  Volunteers crowd around the recruiting table,

YELLING and jostling for position.

The delegates walk out.  Both Patriots and Loyalists give

Marion a wide berth.

Marion sees Gabriel, standing near the crowd at the

recruiting table.  Marion walks up to him.

Marion looks closely at Gabriel.

They lock eyes for a moment, then Gabriel turns from his

father and walks away, joining the crush around the

recruiting table.

Marion stands alone in the middle of the chaos.  The FIFES

AND DRUMS continue to play.  Marion doesn't hear them.

Harry Lee walks out of the Assembly hall with a triumphant

group of Patriots who look at Marion coldly.

Lee excuses himself, and steps over next to Marion.  Lee

sees that Marion is watching Gabriel at the enlistment

table.

They shake hands.  Then Lee walks over to the soldiers.

Marion takes a last look at Gabriel, then heads off

through the crowded square, moving against the tide of men

headed toward the recruiting table.

EXT.  POND BLUFF - DAY

Springtime.  The apple tree at the top of the hill is

covered with blossoms.

SUPERIMPOSITION:

EXT.  FIELD - POND BLUFF - DAY

Marion plows a field.  Nathan leads the plowhorse.  Samuel

follows, breaking up the clods of dirt.  Hard work.  They

stop to catch their breath.  A SOFT WIND blows.

Marion turns his head as if listening for a faint voice.

He hears nothing.  He snaps the reins and continues

plowing.

INT.  MARION'S ATTIC - LATE AFTERNOON

Dark.  Thomas steps up into the attic.  He finds a trunk

and opens it.  Lifting out some blankets, he uncovers a

trove of Marion's old military gear -- a worn battle coat,

a box of medals, a military sword, rusted into its

scabbard.

Thomas puts on the coat, which hangs off his narrow

shoulders.  He stands in front of a dusty mirror,

appraising himself, then stops as he hears FOOTSTEPS

coming up the stairs.

It's Marion, tired and dirty from his plowing.  Thomas

grimaces, expecting him to be angry, but sees him shake

his head gently.

Marion looks closely at his son, giving him the courtesy

of really thinking about the answer.

Thomas considers it, then nods.

Marion offers his hand.  They shake firmly, like adults.

Marion takes the coat off Thomas and puts it back in the

trunk.  They walk down the stairs together.

INT.  POND BLUFF - DAWN

All is quiet.  A dawn mist hovers close over the ground.

Some sparrows feed at the base of the apple tree near the

gravesite.  DISTANT THUNDER.  Low and rolling.  The birds

stop feeding, uneasy, then fly away.

INT.  MARION'S BEDROOM - DAWN

At another roll of the DISTANT THUNDER Marion awakes.  He

gets out of bed and pulls on his clothes.

EXT.  FRONT PORCH - MARION'S HOUSE - DAWN

Marion steps out to his front porch and listens.  He knows

the sound, the DISTANT STACCATO BOOMS OF CANNON and the

PATTERING WAVE OF THOUSANDS OF MUSKETS FIRING.

One by one the children join him.  Thomas, Nathan and

Samuel listen analytically.  Margaret and Susan press

close against their father.  William looks curiously at

the cloudless sky.

The SOUND BECOMES DEEPER, MORE OMINOUS.  They all notice

the change.

Marion puts on a smile.

Thomas appears at the doorway with a pair of muskets.  He

gives one to Nathan and offers the other to his father.

Reluctantly, Thomas takes the muskets back into the house.

They all nod.  Marion walks off toward the workshop,

followed by Susan.  The others hesitate.

They head off to do as they were told.

INT.  WORKSHOP - DAY

Marion works the lathe.  Susan watches from her perch on

the woodpile.

EXT.  BARN - DAY

The SOUND OF A CRASH from inside the barn.  An angry cow

runs out of the barn, dragging a tenacious Samuel who is

holding onto the cow's neck.

Samuel's grip fails and he lands in the dirt.  The cow

runs about thirty yards down the hill, stopping on the

bank of the river.  Samuel grabs a rope and heads down the

hill to get the cow.

ON THE RIVERBANK

As Samuel approaches the cow, he see it skittishly

approaching then retreating from the water.  Then he sees

the cause -- the water in the river has a pale, pink hue.

Samuel stares at it, trying to figure out what it is.

Behind him, Margaret sees her brother beyond the yard

wall.

He doesn't respond.  Margaret, trailed by William, walks

down toward Samuel.

Then she sees it, too.  The pale pink is turning redder

and redder.  And then the BODIES.  First one, then more,

many more.  Torn apart.  Missing limbs.  Those with wide-

open wounds, are already drained of blood.  Others are

still seeping, leaving trails of deep red in the paler red

of the surrounding water.

Samuel, Margaret and William stand frozen, appalled and

fascinated.

MARION steps out of the workshop and sees the children at

the river.  He can't see what they're looking at.

Irritated, he walks toward them.  Then, as he nears the

river, he sees the color of the water and the bodies that

have hypnotized his children.  He quickens his stride,

speaking calmly but firmly, careful not to frighten them.

EXT.  MARION'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Quiet.  Dark.  Marion stands on the front porch, looking

out into the night, listening, hearing nothing.  He

glances up at the star-filled sky, tracking his eyes from

the Big Dipper to the NORTH STAR.

BEHIND THE HOUSE, A FIGURE IN THE DARKNESS, carrying a

musket, moves from shadow to shadow.

INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT

Margaret and Samuel and William talk, their voices low.

A SOUND.  They all stop.  Something moved behind the

kitchen.  Margaret silently eases the others out of the

room, through the darkened hall toward their father.

SUDDENLY IN FRONT OF THEM, A BLOODY FIGURE

Big.  Hulking.  In uniform.  Margaret SCREAMS.  William

and Samuel CRY OUT.  The figure moves toward them...

Marion, on the porch, hears the scream, races into the

house.  He sees the figure, moves toward it...

THE FIGURE MOVES INTO THE LIGHT... Marion sees the

bloodied face...

Gabriel is wounded, battered and dirty.  He carries a

musket and a dispatch case.  He sways.  Marion catches him

and eases him to a seat.

Marion checks Gabriel's wounds which are nasty but not

life-threatening.

Margaret brings water and linen to Marion who expertly

cleans Gabriel's wounds and applies field-dressings.

Marion's appalled.

Gabriel nods.  Marion's stunned.  Gabriel tries to rise.

Gabriel passes out.  Marion catches him and carries him to

a day-bed in the parlor.  As Marion lays him down, they

hear HEAVY MUSKET FIRE, VERY CLOSE.

Marion hurries to the door and looks out into the night,

the children cluster around him, seeing a strange sight.

A SKIRMISH IN THE FIELD BELOW THE HOUSE

Pitch black.  Then a MUSKET FIRES, creating a FLASH OF

LIGHT that illuminates a tableau of soldiers, about three

dozen Redcoats and as many Patriots.

The strobe of the musket shot provides targets for an

ensuing VOLLEY OF SHOTS in every direction.  Then

darkness, punctuated by SCREAMS OF PAIN, CONFUSED

HOLLERING and the RUSTLING OF ARMED MEN IN MOVEMENT.

Then the pattern repeats itself:  A MUSKET FIRES,

illuminating a tableau of targets for another MURDEROUS

VOLLEY OF SHOTS.

They hurry off.  Marion steps into the house and opens his

gun cabinet.  He extracts two pistols and a pair of

muskets.  Then he steps back to the front door.  He waits

and watches.

EXT.  LOWER FIELD - POND BLUFF - DAWN

First light.  The morning mist lies low over the field.

Marion warily approaches the scene of the battle.  He

carries a Pennsylvania rifle, has another slung over his

shoulder, and has a pair of pistols in his belt.

As Marion nears the field he sees, appearing out of the

low mist, a nightmarish vision.  Young Redcoats and

Continentals are scattered on the ground, dead and

wounded.  Many have been hideously torn apart by the

massive musket balls.  Blood is everywhere.  Marion

hurries back toward the house.

EXT.  LOWER FIELD - POND BLUFF - MORNING

Marion loads the wounded men onto a wagon, helped by

Thomas, Nathan and Samuel.

EXT.  MARION'S HOUSE - POND BLUFF - DAY

The porch and yard have been turned into a field hospital.

There are about two dozen wounded, a few more Patriots

than Redcoats.  Thomas, Nathan, Samuel and Margaret help

Marion tend the soldiers.  William and Susan watch from

inside.

Marion treats an arm wound, retying a tourniquet,

stanching an ugly flow of blood.

Marion moves to the next of the wounded.  Thomas starts to

help but Marion shakes his head.

Marion moves on to another.

They turn over a young Continental and see a horrible

wound on his back.  Thomas, swoons.

A hard glare from Marion strengthens his son.  Together

they bandage the wounded man.

EXT.  MARION'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON

Triage completed.  Margaret and Samuel give water and

food.  Marion kneels next to a CONTINENTAL SERGEANT and a

COUPLE OF PRIVATES who are less severely wounded than the

others.

Marion nods, uncomfortable with the thanks.

The Continental Sergeant knows what's coming.  The

Privates and Marion's children don't.

The Privates are stunned at the request.  The Sergeant

looks at Marion's children and nods.

He struggles to his feet and jerks his head for the two

Privates to do the same.

Nathan, Samuel and Margaret are confused.

Marion motions to a large, old scar on his arm.

Marion's children are not convinced.  The Sergeant and the

two Privates gather themselves to leave.

The wounded men nod grimly and start off down the road.

Marion and his children watch them go.

EXT.  POND BLUFF ROAD - DAY

A dirt road runs along the edge of the Santee Swamps,

stretching toward green, rolling hills beyond.  Beautiful

country.  Peaceful.  Then, the GROUND BEGINS TO SHAKE.  A

THUNDEROUS SOUND rises, louder and louder.  HORSES HOOVES.

From around a bend, a detachment of cavalry gallops:

British GREEN DRAGOONS.  The finest light calvary in the

world.  Hard, strong men.  Excellent horsemen.  Their

mounts are powerful, muscled and perfectly cared for.  The

Dragoons themselves are all hardened veterans, marked with

the blood and dirt of a recent battle.  Tired and

vigorous.

They're armed to the teeth.  Each carries a flintlock

carbine, a brace of pistols and a sword.  Some carry

lances as well.  Regimental flags flutter.  They are forty

of the most imposing, frightening horsemen imaginable.

And at their head, the most imposing man of all, LT.

COLONEL BANASTRE TARLETON.  "The Butcher."  Aristocratic.

Strong.  Dark.  A powerful horseman on the best mount of

the entire troop.  Decorated.  Imperious.  No temper, just

hard, cold authority.  His men struggle to keep up with

him.

Behind them, two dozen LOYALIST MILITIA CALVARY (American

civilians loyal to the crown).  Nasty, local men.

Civilian clothes.  Riding at their head is AMOS GASKINS,

grizzled, lower-class, wearing ill-fitting patrician's

clothing.

AROUND A BEND

The three wounded Patriots who just left Marion's farm

hear the horses coming, stand on the side of the road,

raise their arms and a white cloth of surrender.

The Green Dragoons rein in.  Tarleton stops in front of

the three men.  He motions for one of his men to lower his

weapon.  Then he speaks calmly, quietly, to the wounded

men.

They hesitate.

Tarleton turns to his second-in-command, MAJOR WILKINS.

Tarleton rides off.  Wilkins and several other Dragoons

calmly FIRE THEIR PISTOLS, killing the three Patriots.

The troops ride off, thundering past the bodies of the

three men.

EXT.  POND BLUFF - DAY

Marion and his children tend the wounded.  Gabriel, weak

but walking, helps.  REDCOAT INFANTRY appears out of the

woods, heading toward the house.  Three dozen men.  Scouts

and flank units covering the main body.  Marion gathers

his family around him, stands and waits.

The Redcoats get to the house, warily eye the wounded and

Marion's family.  A young REDCOAT LIEUTENANT motions his

men to check out the house and barn, then looks at the

wounded, doing a silent count.  He turns to Marion.

Marion nods.  ONE OF THE REDCOATS emerges from the house

carrying Gabriel's dispatch case.

Gabriel steps up.

The SOUND OF HORSES HOOVES.  All turn and see:

TARLETON AND THE GREEN DRAGOONS

Thundering down the road toward the house.  It's an

impressive, frightening sight.

They rein in their horses, stopping in the yard, enveloped

by their trailing cloud of dust.

Tarleton surveys the scene, then speaks to the young

Redcoat Lieutenant.

He hands the dispatch case to Tarleton.

Tarleton opens it and quickly scans the contents.

Marion quickly steps between Tarleton and Gabriel.

Tarleton ignores Marion and continues speaking to the

Lieutenant.

The Redcoat Lieutenant and several of his men are shocked

by the order.  Marion is, also, but he's more concerned

with Gabriel.  He pushes past some Redcoats and stands at

Tarleton's mount, looking up.

Tarleton finally pays attention to Marion.  He looks down

at his anguished face and offers the barest of smiles.

Tarleton draws his pistol and points it at Marion.

Gabriel tries to intercede but is held back by a burly

Redcoat Corporal.

Tarleton controls his shifting mount, keeping his pistol

trained on Marion's face.

Marion doesn't answer.  He looks up at Tarleton coldly,

taking his measure, waiting to see if he's going to pull

the trigger.

Tarleton walks his horse a couple of steps and shifts his

aim, pointing the pistol among Marion's children.

The children are terrified.  Thomas is more angry than

frightened.  Marion quickly steps between the pistol and

his children and speaks quietly to Tarleton.

Tarleton sees the terrified expressions on the faces of

Marion's children.  He smiles at the effect.  Then he

holsters his pistol.

Marion and his children watch as one of the Redcoats ties

Gabriel's hands.  Thomas is beside himself.

Thomas grows increasingly agitated.  He sees that his

father is going to do nothing.  He gauges the distance

between Gabriel and the cover of the nearby woods.

Then suddenly, Thomas SPRINGS.  He RUNS, THROWING HIMSELF,

into the two Redcoats holding Gabriel, KNOCKING THEM DOWN.

Gabriel is too shocked to take flight.  A few of the

Redcoats, including one of the ones knocked down, shake

their heads with sad laughter at Thomas' ineffectual

gesture.  One of them grabs Thomas by the scruff of the

neck and yanks him to his feet.

TARLETON sees the commotion.  Without pausing he DRAWS HIS

PISTOL AND FIRES, HITTING THOMAS IN THE BACK.

THOMAS is thrown to his knees by the shot.  Stunned,

confused, he looks down and sees the massive exit wound in

his chest.

MARION, horrified, catches Thomas as he falls, easing him

to the ground.

MARGARET CRIES OUT.  THE OTHER CHILDREN are stunned to

silence.

The REDCOATS are frozen in place.  Tarleton's GREEN

DRAGOONS are impassive, having seen worse.

MARION holds his son, looking at the huge,

incomprehensible wound.  He knows that Thomas is already

dead, though his body still moves.

MARION'S stunned agony turns to fury.  He rises, his eyes

trained on Tarleton, then stops as...

TARLETON raises a second loaded pistol and a DOZEN GREEN

DRAGOONS raise pistols and carbines, aiming them at Marion

and his children.

MARION FREEZES, torn between his fury and fear for his

other children.  He locks his eyes on Tarleton.

TARLETON calmly baths in Marion's anger.  Then, with a

hard yank of the reins, he jerks his horse's head around

and utters a sharp command to Wilkins.

Tarleton spurs his horse and rides off without looking

back.  His GREEN DRAGOONS THUNDER after him.

MARION'S CHILDREN begin to cry.  Margaret tries to revive

Thomas' lifeless body, gently caressing his cheek.

The Redcoats watch in silence.  MARION LOOKS AT GABRIEL

and turns to the Redcoat Lieutenant.

The Lieutenant wavers, but he looks after the departing

Tarleton and his resolve stiffens.  He turns coldly to

Marion.

The Redcoat infantrymen scatter, some to get horses and

wagons from the barn, others to torch the buildings.

MARION stands among the children, all of whom look to

Marion with pleading eyes, waiting for him to do

something.

With stone-faced fury, Marion watches the Redcoats do

their work.

From the barns, they hear the sounds of MUSKETS FIRING and

the SQUEALS OF THE LIVESTOCK being killed.

Other REDCOATS TORCH THE HOUSE, BARN AND OUTBUILDINGS.

THE FLAMES RISE.

The Redcoats bring out Marion's wagons and carriages and

begin loading the Redcoat wounded.

The Redcoat Lieutenant and several of his men walk among

the Patriot wounded who start to struggle to their feet,

begging for mercy.  The Redcoats quickly OPEN FIRE, as if

to get it over with.

The WOUNDED PATRIOTS CRY OUT.  More SHOTS.  Then SILENCE.

GABRIEL, his hands bound behind him, looks to his father

with a combination of resoluteness and fear.  Marion locks

eyes with him.

MARION AND THE CHILDREN

Watch as the Redcoats form up and move out, leading

Gabriel on a tether.  Gabriel looks back helplessly but a

hard jerk on the rope by one of the Redcoats turns him

around.  They disappear around a bend in the road.

THE INSTANT THE REDCOATS ARE OUT OF SIGHT, MARION speaks

firmly to his weeping children.

MARION STRIDES to his front door and ENTERS THE BURNING

HOUSE.

INSIDE, FIRE EVERYWHERE.  Picking a route between the

flames, Marion walks to his gun cabinet.  He opens it and

pulls out weapons -- two Pennsylvania rifles, two muskets,

two pistols, a long-bladed knife and a worn tomahawk.  He

carries them, with powder horns and ammunition pouches

back toward the door.

Marion walks OUT OF THE BURNING HOUSE.

Without breaking stride, Marion throws muskets to Nathan

and Samuel who catch them.

Marion runs off toward the woods, Nathan and Samuel

follow.  Margaret hesitates, then herds William and Susan

toward the river.  The house is enveloped in flames.

EXT.  WOODED PATH - AFTERNOON

Marion runs, breathing hard, keeping a punishing, steady

pace.  Nathan and Samuel run behind, less winded than

their father.  Marion makes up with cold fury what he

lacks in youth.

EXT.  WOODED HILLSIDE - AFTERNOON

Marion runs up to the crest of a wooded hill.  Slows.

Crawls the last few feet.  Nathan and Samuel just behind

him.  Looks over the hillside.

A path runs through a glen, about fifty feet below.

Marion's eyes dart, absorbing the terrain, looking for

advantage.  He points.

The boys go where they're told.

They stagger under the weight of the orders.  Marion

notices but continues.

The boys hesitate.  Marion looks at them firmly.

Marion disappears into the underbrush.

DOWN THE PATH

The dozen Redcoats approach.  Leading Gabriel on the rope.

AHEAD OF THEM

Marion waits in the thick undergrowth.

On the hillside, Nathan and Samuel grip their muskets and

exchange a frightened, troubled look.

The REDCOATS enter the glen.

MARION waits, then picks his moment and FIRES, killing the

Redcoat Lieutenant with a shot to the chest.

NATHAN AND SAMUEL INSTANTLY FIRE, dropping the last

Redcoat in the line and the one holding Gabriel's rope.

THE REDCOATS STOP in confusion...

GABRIEL kneels, out of the line of fire.

The REDCOAT SERGEANT takes command...

MARION KILLS the Sergeant with a shot to the throat...

Samuel finishes reloading, swaps muskets with Nathan who

FIRES, DROPPING ANOTHER REDCOAT.

Marion FIRES, killing the Corporal, the last man of

rank...

Marion ducks to the side as a VOLLEY OF REDCOAT MUSKET

FIRE tears into the spot marked by Marion's rifle smoke...

FROM THIS MOMENT ON, MARION NEVER STOPS MOVING.  He

strides rather than runs, staying just inside the brush,

offering only glimpses of himself.  He changes his pace

and direction repeatedly, ducking and weaving, firing and

loading while moving.  He never gives the Redcoats a

stationary target, especially one marked by billowing

smoke from his flintlock.  It's an Indian tactic and it

works.

The Redcoats TRACK HIM WITH THEIR BARRELS, about to

fire... Marion suddenly STOPS DEAD, REVERSES DIRECTION,

several REDCOATS FIRE AND MISS.

Six Redcoats left.  Some primed, some reloading.  A

REDCOAT draws a bead on Marion who drops to the ground and

FIRES, killing him.

Samuel, WEEPING as he loads, hands a primed musket to

Nathan who FIRES...

The Redcoats turn their attention to THE SPOT MARKED BY

NATHAN'S SMOKE...

Marion SEES THE REDCOATS AIMING TOWARD THE BOYS.  He

instantly STRIDES OUT INTO THE OPEN, drawing the Redcoats'

attention from his sons...

Marion FIRES BOTH HIS PISTOLS, killing two Redcoats...

One Redcoat finishes reloading... Marion rushes him,

shoves aside the barrel and SLAMS him in the face with the

butt of the musket...

This is a DIFFERENT MARION, a vicious, savage Marion,

killing with stunning brutality...

Marion drops his own expended rifle and CATCHES THE

REDCOAT'S LOADED MUSKET before it hits the ground shoves

that musket into another Redcoat's belly and FIRES...

Two Redcoats left, neither finished loading...

MARION CHARGES, drawing his TOMAHAWK, ignores a GLANCING

BAYONET WOUND to the neck, HACKS a Redcoat open...

Splattering himself with BLOOD...

The final Redcoat, a cherubic-face young man, ducks into

the woods... Marion tears after him...

A FOOTRACE... the young Redcoat BLASTING THROUGH THE

BRUSH... the older Marion, panting, losing ground...

A CLEARING... the Redcoat is almost to the cover of the

trees on the far side...

MARION THROWS HIS TOMAHAWK which FLIES through the air and

SINKS IN THE REDCOAT'S BACK...

Marion runs to the wounded Redcoat, grabs his hair, yanks

back his head and SLITS HIS THROAT...

Then, without pausing, Marion wrenches the tomahawk from

the Redcoat's body, and races back toward his sons...

AT THE GLEN

Nathan and a weeping Samuel, stunned at the carnage,

stumble down the hillside toward Gabriel.  Marion runs up

and motions for them to stop.

Marion, checks the Redcoats, making sure they're all dead.

They quickly do so as Marion picks up a loaded musket and

scans the road and the underbrush.  In a moment they're

ready.  Marion finds his own Pennsylvania rifle, then he

and his sons disappear into the underbrush.

EXT.  POND BLUFF - DAY

The house and barns smolder.  Thomas' body lies in the

yard.  Nearby, the bodies of the Patriot wounded, now

dead.

EXT.  RIVER SHED - POND BLUFF - DAY

Margaret waits in the shed with William and Susan.  They

hear a SOUND.  APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS.  Margaret pulls her

sister and brother to her and waits.

The door opens.  It's Marion and Gabriel, Nathan and

Samuel.  Margaret and the little ones throw themselves

into Marion's arms.

Margaret notices the blood on Marion.  She hesitates but

her relief tightens her embrace.

EXT.  POND BLUFF - DAY

Marion, trailed by his children, walks past the soldiers'

bodies and the remains of their house.

He kneels down next to Thomas' body.  On the ground Marion

sees several of THOMAS' LEAD SOLDIERS.  He stares at them

for a moment, picks them up and puts them in his pocket.

Marion picks up Thomas and carries him up the hill toward

the apple tree and Elizabeth's grave.  The children

follow.

EXT.  HILLTOP - POND BLUFF - DAY

Marion digs a grave.  The children watch.  The only sounds

are Marion's labored BREATHING, the RASP OF THE SHOVEL and

the RUSTLE OF DEAD LEAVES blown along the ground by a soft

wind.

Some dry leaves catch on Thomas' still wet blood, as if

trying to bandage his wound.

EXT.  HILLTOP - POND BLUFF - DAY (LATER)

Marion puts the last shovelfuls of dirt on the grave.

Near tears and unsure of what to do next, he turns to

Elizabeth's gravestone.  The soft wind blows.  Marion

listens.

He turns and sees his children looking up at him.  Holding

in his own tears, he gathers the children around him and

let's them cry.

He stiffens, speaking formally:

Marion looks at Elizabeth's grave, then he gently eases

his children away.

EXT.  BENNINGTON OVERLOOK - DAY

Marion and his children stop at the overlook, seeing the

Santee River valley spread out before them.  The SMOKE

from two dozen farms rises.

The smoke from the separate fires joins together high in

the sky, forming what looks like stormclouds.  They walk

on.

EXT.  CHARLOTTE'S FARM - NIGHT

Marion and his children wait in the cover of the woods.

They see a pair of shadowed figures coming toward them

from the house, Gabriel and Charlotte.

Marion hustles the children out of the woods.

INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT

Charlotte sits, holding a sleeping Susan.  The other

children lie awake on pallets.  Marion, still streaked

with dried blood and sweat, tucks William and Margaret

into bed.

Marion moves on to Nathan.

Marion isn't.  He turns to Samuel who's cried-out.  Marion

reaches out to touch him but Samuel recoils from Marion's

blood-streaked hand.  Marion sighs and tucks him in.

Marion moves to take Susan from Charlotte who shakes her

head.

Marion nods and leaves Charlotte with the children.

INT.  CHARLOTTE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Marion enters.  He starts to pace but grows unsteady.  He

rears back as if screaming but no sound comes from his

mouth, as he looks upstairs, knowing his children are

searching for the solace of sleep.

He opens a cabinet, pulls out a bottle of liquor, pours

and drinks.  Then another.

THE SOUND OF HORSEMEN.  Gabriel walks in.  Tired.  Grim.

Marion just shakes his head.

Marion nods.  Marion and Gabriel stand in silence for a

long moment, neither one finding words.  Then Gabriel

speaks softly.

He leaves Marion alone.

INT.  CHARLOTTE'S FARMHOUSE - NIGHT (LATER)

Marion stares at the fireplace.  Charlotte walks in

carrying a pitcher and fresh clothing.

Marion is silent.  Charlotte pours water into a washbowl

and motions to Marion.  He takes off his shirt.  She

begins cleaning away the blood and tending the wound on

his neck.

She looks at him closely.

He stares past her, looking at the flames in the

fireplace.  She tends his wounds.

EXT.  PORCH - CHARLOTTE'S FARMHOUSE - MORNING

Marion and Gabriel finish saddling their horses.  Marion

embraces Nathan and Samuel.  Then he turns to Margaret,

William and Susan.

Marion winces.  Margaret puts her arm around William.

Marion kisses them both, then moves on to Susan, trying to

coax a word out of the silent four-year-old:

She just looks at him.

Susan shakes her head.  He sighs, rises and turns to

Charlotte.  They hesitate, then embrace, hugging deeply

but a bit awkwardly, holding each other just a moment

longer than one would expect.  She looks up at him... he

kisses her on the cheek.

Marion mounts up.  And he and Gabriel head off, Susan,

unnoticed and unheard, whispers:

Marion and Gabriel ride away.

EXT.  CAMDEN ROAD - DAY

Marion and Gabriel ride past the signs of a small

skirmish.  Bodies.  Abandoned wagons.  Dead horses.  A

burning farm.

EXT.  CAMDEN HILLSIDE - DAY

Marion and Gabriel ride to the crest of a hill.  A vista

spreads out before them.  They see an awesome sight -- A

MASSIVE SLASH OF RED approaches a MASSIVE SLASH OF BLUE.

A battle is taking place about five miles away.

Gabriel starts to spur his horse but Marion restrains him.

Gabriel stops.  Marion points out brightly colored

clusters of men behind each army.

The distant slash of red stops.  Marion and Gabriel hear

only a GENTLE WIND and some nearby SONGBIRDS.

Then, from a black mass of the side of the red slash, a

sudden, silent eruption of white smoke.

An instant later, the blue slash quivers.  A moment later

the SOUND OF THE CANNONS, RUMBLES UP THE HILL and rolls

over Marion and Gabriel.

The RED SLASH STOPS moving.  It darkens as thousands of

Redcoats raise their muskets and the front ranks kneel

into firing position.

Marion's eyes dart.  He knows what's coming.

A MASSIVE ERUPTION OF WHITE SMOKE billows from the red

slash.  An instant later, the blue line starts to break up

as hundreds of distant Patriots fall.

The SOUND OF THE BRITISH MUSKETS reaches Marion and

Gabriel like the pattering of rain.

Then the SMOKE OF INEFFECTIVE, SCATTERED VOLLEYS erupts

from the Patriot lines.  The red line holds firm.

But the blue line of the Patriots stays in the open field.

From behind the Redcoats, FAST-MOVING GREEN AND RED MASSES

move quickly onto the battlefield.  CAVALRY.

The British cavalry slams into the blue line, shattering

it.  Tiny bits of blue move in every direction.

Marion watches, appalled.  At this distance the moving

slashes of color and billowing smoke are strangely

beautiful.  Marion turns his horse and heads down the

hill, toward the rear of the Patriot lines.

EXT.  AMERICAN ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT

A nightmare.  SCREAMS OF AGONY.  A few hundred battered,

Patriot survivors treat their wounded and prepare to move

out.  The battle, so bloodless and beautiful at a

distance, has, in its aftermath, become horrifically

painful and ugly.

Marion and Gabriel ride into camp, passing nervous

sentries and a field surgery which is surrounded by pools

of blood and amputated legs and arms.  Marion sees HARRY

LEE at a make-shift command post, barking orders, trying

to pull things together.

The Lieutenant rushes off.  Lee notices Marion and

Gabriel, surprised to see them.  He jerks his head for

them to follow him into:

LEE'S COMMAND TENT

Once out of sight of the men, Lee loses his command

bearing.  Exhausted, he leans on his campaign table and

looks closely at Marion, asking with his eyes why Marion

is here.

Lee gives Marion a tired smile.

Lee ROLLS OUT A MAP for Marion and Gabriel.

At the mention of Tarleton, Marion nods.

Lee quickly writes something.

He hands it to Marion.  Gabriel steps forward.

Lee scribbles another order and hands it to Gabriel.  Then

he turns to Marion.

Marion nods.  They duck out of the tent.

EXT.  AMERICAN ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT (LATER)

Marion and Gabriel stand watching Lee and his Continental

regulars move out.  Gabriel turns to Marion.

Gabriel steps in front of Marion.

Marion looks at Gabriel closely.

Marion looks Gabriel up and down.

They mount up.

They ride off in different directions.

EXT.  BRADFORD VILLAGE - NIGHT

Marion rides into a small village, passing several bodies

in blue Continental uniforms, hanging from lampposts.

Marion stops in front of a tavern, dismounts and enters.

INT.  TAVERN - BRADFORD - NIGHT

As Marion walks in he's greeted by cold stares from half-

a-dozen men, huddles over their drinks.

Marion looks closely at the grim, suspicious men.

As Marion turns to leave he notices an open bottle of

Madeira on one of the tables.  He stops.

A stand-off.  Then, a hulking FIGURE appears in the

shadows at the back doorway.  He's JOHN BILLINGS, big,

coarse, about Marion's age.  Billings jerks his head for

Marion to join him in the back room.

INT.  BACK ROOM - TAVERN - NIGHT

Dark.  Marion and billings talk over a bottle.

Marion drains his glass and stands up.

Billings drains his glass.  They walk out together.

EXT.  TAVERN - BRADFORD - NIGHT

Marion and Billings ride away from the tavern, passing the

hanging Patriot bodies.

EXT.  SNOW'S ISLAND - SANTEE SWAMPS - NIGHT

A CACOPHONY OF BIRDS AND INSECTS.  Swamp maples and

willows form a canopy over moss-covered mounds and pools

of plant-choked water.

Gabriel leads several men, riding along a dry path that

snakes through the swamp.  They cross a narrow land bridge

onto a wooded island, joining a dozen-and-a-half men,

including Marion who kneels at a campfire.

CLOSE SHOT:  Several of Thomas' brightly painted LEAD

SOLDIERS MELT in a cast-iron pan.  The little men fall to

their knees then lose form, turning into bubbling, molten

metal.

The new arrivals dismount and greet the others.

Gabriel steps up behind Marion and watches as he pours the

lead into a bullet mold, closes the lid and dips the mold

into a bucket of water which HISSES and STEAMS.

Marion doesn't look up.

Marion puts some more lead soldiers into the pan.  Gabriel

shakes his head, turns away and goes to tend his horse.

EXT.  SNOW'S ISLAND ENCAMPMENT - MORNING

Day breaks.  A low, thick swamp mist covers the

encampment.  Marion, sits alone by the embers of last

night's campfire.  The men are awake.  Some eat, others

talk.

Marion pulls himself out of his dark reverie.  He takes

the bullets from the mold and puts them in a pouch

attached to his weapons' belt.  Then he rises and heads

over to the men.

He surveys his brigade.  Twenty-six men:  framers,

artisans, mountain men, none in uniform.  Marion walks

among them, nodding familiarly to several.  He notices an

imposing looking Cherokee Indian, BROTHER JOSEPH, standing

a bit apart from the others.  They exchange nods.

He notices a stern-looking man in partial clerical garb,

REV. CHARLES OLIVER.

Marion accepts his condolences.  He notes GEORGE DALTON, a

tough-looking, rustic man with an ice-cold, distant stare.

Dalton doesn't respond.  Marion recognizes another face,

ABNER BROWN, African-American, around thirty, rugged.

Marion addresses the men who do not gather around so much

as just give him their attention.

Marion pauses and looks over at Gabriel.

Gabriel nods, approvingly.

Marion looks from face to face.

Marion heads back to his campsite, passing Gabriel without

looking at him, but very aware of his son's eyes on him.

EXT.  BRITISH FIELD HEADQUARTERS - CAMDEN - DAY

A massive British army field encampment.  Thousands of

well-armed, veteran troops.  Large detachments of Redcoats

march through endless rows of tents.  Some are battle-

worn, others are fresh troops moving out.

TARLETON and his GREEN DRAGOONS, covered with dirt and

sweat, ride into the encampment.  Tarleton and Wilkins

peel off, riding to the front of a farmhouse that has been

commandeered for British headquarters.  They dismount and

stride in.

INT.  CORNWALLIS' HEADQUARTERS - CAMDEN FARMHOUSE - DAY

British officers, clerks and aides work.  They're in good

spirits.  LORD CORNWALLIS, a proud man, comfortable with

command, coldly notes one of his officers slapping another

on the back.  MAJOR HUNTINGTON rolls out a map for

Cornwallis.

The officers gather around the map.

Tarleton enters, followed by Wilkins.

Tarleton and Wilkins join them around the map.

Cornwallis turns to his field officers, paying particular

attention to Tarleton.

Tarleton proudly holds Cornwallis' look.

Wilkins shifts uneasily.  Tarleton isn't cowed.

Cornwallis looks at his other officers.

Cornwallis shifts his eyes back to Tarleton who was not

among those who spoke.  Tarleton pointedly pauses a

moment, then says:

Cornwallis turns his attention back to the map.  His men

gather around.

EXT.  CORNWALLIS' FIELD HEADQUARTERS - CAMDEN - DAY

Tarleton and Wilkins walk out and mount up.

Tarleton jerks his reins and rides off.  Wilkins laughs

and follows.

EXT.  WOODED ROAD - DAY

A British supply train of several dozen wagons, a herd of

horses and accompanying Redcoats makes its way.

ON A WOODED HILLSIDE, Gabriel lies on the ground,

observing the convoy.  He eases back, mounts up, and rides

off.

EXT.  BRIDGE - SANTEE RIVER - DAY

Marion and his men wait, well-hidden in the brush on a

rise, just above the bridge.  Gabriel rides up.

Marion nods and motions to his men who check their weapons

and pass the word.  Gabriel ties up his horse and takes a

position near his father.

EXT.  SANTEE ROAD - NIGHT

The British convoy rounds the curve.  When two-thirds of

the wagons have crossed the bridge, Marion FIRES, killing

the Redcoat of highest rank, a CAPTAIN.

BILLINGS AND DALTON heave CORKED BOTTLES which break,

spreading their OILY CONTENTS on the wooden bridge.

BROTHER JOSEPH fires a FLAMING ARROW, igniting the oil.

The BRIDGE BURSTS INTO FLAMES, cutting off the tail of the

convoy, stranding a dozen wagons and the herd of horses on

Marion's side of the river.

A REDCOAT LIEUTENANT takes command.

Marion calls to his men.

Marion and his men FIRE A WITHERING VOLLEY, KILLING ALL

REDCOATS OF RANK -- two lieutenants, a sergeant and

several corporals.

The LEADERLESS REDCOAT PRIVATES take cover as Marion's men

OPEN UP on the Redcoats on their side of the river.

With half of his men FIRING COVER, Marion and the other

half run to the wagons, passing Redcoat dead and

wounded...

DALTON, notices a WOUNDED REDCOAT and pauses...

The Redcoat looks up imploringly at Dalton who finishes

reloading, then coldly FIRES, KILLING THE helpless

Redcoat...

Marion, Gabriel and Rev. Oliver see Dalton kill the

wounded Redcoat as they race toward the wagons, British

musketballs SPLINTERING TREES all around them...

The horses nearest the burning bridge are terrified,

BUCKING AND REARING, STRUGGLING in their traces...

MARION LEAPS INTO THE SEAT of one wagon.  Gabriel and

Billings grab the reins of two more wagons.

The Redcoats keep up a STEADY FIRE.  TWO OF MARION'S MEN

FALL, one dead another wounded.

Marion, Gabriel and Billings STRUGGLE TO CONTROL THE

FRIGHTENED HORSES, backing them up around the curve to the

cover of the woods.

MARION'S REARGUARD, Brother Joseph, Abner, Dan Scott and

others, withdraws in leapfrog, FIRING BACK ACROSS THE

RIVER.

BRITISH MUSKET BALLS SLAM into the trees and SPLINTER THE

WAGONS...

Another of Marion's men is WOUNDED.  Two of his comrades

HEAVE HIM onto one of the wagons...

As Marion's men get the wagons turned and unblocked from

each other, they DRIVE THEM OFF, one after another...

Brother Joseph, Abner and the rest of the rearguard make

it to Marion and LEAP INTO HIS WAGON...

MARION snaps the reins and they THUNDER OFF, away from the

BURNING BRIDGE and the FIRING Redcoats.

EXT.  SNOW'S ISLAND - DAY

Marion's men tend their wounded and look through the

British wagons, taking inventory.

Marion checks out a wagon full of tools with DAN SCOTT and

ROB FIELDING, a couple of sharp-eyed craftsmen.  They

overlap dialogue, rapidly speaking the private language of

colonial artisans.

Scott and Fielding exchange an impressed look.

Scott and Fielding roll up their sleeves and get to work.

Marion hears a COMMOTION OF BARKING DOGS AND YELLING MEN

and strides over to find Billings cowering before TWO HUGE

GREAT DANES who stand guard at one of the wagons.

Dalton prepares to do so.

Marion steps forward, speaking softly but firmly to the

dogs.

The dogs waver between obeying Marion and ripping out his

throat.

The dogs decide to obey.  Marion lets them sniff his hand,

then firmly pats them.

Rev. Oliver and Abner join him.  Billings eases past the

dogs.  Abner opens a large case and finds it filled with

bottles.

Gabriel opens a trunk and finds it filled with powdered

wigs, all perfectly coifed and stored on head-shaped wig-

stands.  Rev. Oliver opens one of several identical cases

and finds it filled with papers.

Marion grabs some papers, scans them, then finds matching

cases on nearby wagons.

Abner calls from another wagon.

Ignoring Abner, Marion, sits down on a stump with a pile

of Cornwallis' papers and starts to read.

EXT.  SNOW'S ISLAND - NIGHT

Marion sits at Cornwallis' ornate, folding campaign desk,

reading Cornwallis' journal, surrounded by Cornwallis'

field gear which includes furniture, music boxes, oil

paintings and an elaborate folding commode.  The TWO GREAT

DANES sit nearby, eyeing Marion warily.

The men have divided themselves into two groups, one

coarse, the other civilized, each clustered around a

separate fire.

The coarse men, including Dalton, Brother Joseph and

RANDOLPH, a grizzled, black-toothed mountain man, drink

and laugh loudly, wearing Cornwallis' wigs askew.

The civilized men, including Rev. Oliver, Gabriel, Scott,

Fielding and Abner, talk quietly.

Marion puts down the journal and walks over to the

campfire where the rougher men are gathered.  He stands

just inside the firelight and speaks loudly, so that all

can hear:

Marion looks at Dalton, then turns to the other men as

well.

That hits home but Marion remains calm.

Marion looks from face to face.  Most begrudgingly nod.

That's enough for Marion.

As he heads back to his own campfire he's intercepted by

Rev. Oliver who speaks to him out of earshot of the other

men, except for Gabriel and Billings who overhear.

Marion walks on.  Rev. Oliver exchanges a look with

Gabriel, then heads off.  As Marion joins Gabriel and

Billings at his campfire, Billings grips his bottle.

Billings considers that, then shrugs and takes a long

drink.  He hands the bottle to Marion who takes an equally

long drink.  Marion picks up his Pennsylvania rifle.

He disappears into the darkness leaving Gabriel and

Billings at the campfire.

Gabriel shoots Billings a dubious look.

Billings looks closely at Gabriel.

Gabriel looks at Billings, then turns back to the fire.

EXT.  SNOW'S ISLAND - DAWN

The men are beginning to stir, gathering around the

campfires, cooking, using pots, pans and other gear from

the stolen British wagons.

Marion reads Cornwallis' journal.  He looks up, stretches

and walks over to a campfire where Gabriel, Billings and

Rev. Oliver cook.  The dogs follow at a distance.

They all turn to Marion.

The men consider that.

BEGIN MONTAGE:  Series of shots as follows:

-- A VOLLEY OF MUSKET FIRE erupts from some thick

-- Marion rides with about fifty men.

-- A British supply convoy makes its way through the

-- Marion rides with about seventy-five men.

-- Cornwallis finishes reading a dispatch and furiously

-- Marion rides with about one hundred men.

-- Snow's Island.  Marion and his men do an inventory of a

-- Marion rides with about one-hundred-fifty men.

-- Marion, Gabriel, and some of the other men watch as the

-- A seething Cornwallis stands at the same spot, looking

-- Snow's Island.  Marion sits with his muddy feet on

EXT.  CAMDEN - NIGHT

Glittering lights shine from the Camden Inn, a grand

structure in the center of town.

A line of OPULENT CARRIAGES discharges well-dressed

passengers, arriving for a ball.  Ladies in their finery.

Patrician husbands.  Redcoat and Green Dragoon officers in

magnificent dress uniforms.

INT.  CORNWALLIS' PERSONAL QUARTERS - EVENING

Cornwallis, standing in front of a full-length mirror, is

dressed by his VALET while Major Halbert, Colonel

Huntington and Tarleton look on.

Cornwallis holds his temper.

The valet puts a dress coat on Cornwallis who looks at the

garment with deepest disdain.

Cornwallis looks at his reflection with dismay, sighs and

strides out.  Tarleton, amused, follows.

EXT.  CAMDEN STREET - NIGHT

At the far end of town Marion, Gabriel, Billings, Dalton,

Scott and several other men slip through the shadows into

an alley.  The lights from the ball shine from down the

street and the MUSICAL STRAINS of a MINUET drift to them

through the night.

EXT.  ARMORY - NIGHT

A block-like building on the far edge of town.  A pair of

REDCOATS stand guard.  A PAIR OF DRUNKEN REDCOATS stagger

out of a side-street, SINGING A MUMBLING SONG.  The

Redcoat guards look at the drunk Redcoats enviously.

The drunken Redcoats look up, bringing their faces into

the light -- THE DRUNKEN REDCOATS ARE BILLINGS AND DALTON.

Billings and Dalton walk over to the Redcoats guards.  As

the guards reach for the bottles, Billings SLAMS one of

the guards back against the building...

Dalton DRAWS A KNIFE and PLUNGES IT into the second

guard's belly and HACKS HIM OPEN...

Dalton shoves Billings out of the way, SLITS THE OTHER

GUARD'S THROAT.  Billings is taken aback by the speed and

ferocity of Dalton's attack...

Marion and Scott duck into the shadows of the doorway,

pull out hammer-less carving chisels and quickly and

silently start gouging out the wood around the hinges of

the heavy door.

Billings and Dalton take the posts of the guards while the

other men drag the bodies of the real guards out of sight.

Everything appears as it should.

INT.  BALLROOM - NIGHT

Grand.  Opulent.  Cornwallis speaks with a small gathering

of loyalist civilians, among whom is the spectacular MRS.

TALBOT, who wears a daring dress that reveals an enormous

expanse of bosom.  At her side stands her toady of a

husband, MR. TALBOT.

INT./ EXT.  CAMDEN ARMORY - NIGHT

Marion and Scott shove their chisels through the door

which falls away from the hinges.  They all duck inside

finding barrels and casks of gunpowder, boxes of weapons

and hundreds of muskets.

Gabriel and the others load themselves up with the best of

the weapons as Marion opens a cask and pours a trail of

gunpowder across the floor.

EXT.  BALCONY - CAMDEN INN - NIGHT

Cornwallis, taking the night air with Mrs. Talbot, gazes

at the moon, achieving the calculated effect.

Mrs. Talbot sympathetically sighs and touches her

fingertips to her heart which is conveniently located

inches above her stunning cleavage.

A MASSIVE EXPLOSION LIGHTS UP THE NIGHT as a FIREBALL

erupts from the armory.  British officers, including Major

Halbert and Tarleton, RUSH OUT along with Mr. Talbot and

other Loyalist civilians.

Mr. Talbot tears his eyes from the flames and looks at

his wife, clinging to Cornwallis' arm.

Cornwallis registers the insult, glances at the hapless

Major Halbert, then turns to Tarleton.

Tarleton smiles grimly and strides off the balcony.

EXT.  VIEW OF PEMBROKE VILLAGE - DAY

The village of Pembroke lies nestled in a valley,

surrounded by tilled fields and small farms.

EXT.  PEMBROKE VILLAGE - DAY

Forty of Marion's men water their horses.  Marion, with

the two Great Danes at his side, speaks with PETER GREEN,

a middle-aged storekeeper with a marked limp.

Green's daughter, ANNE, very attractive, around sixteen,

joins them.  Gabriel sees her and sidles over.

Gabriel clears his throat.  Anne looks at him coolly.

Green heads across the square where some townspeople are

giving Marion's men provisions.  Anne and Gabriel follow.

Marion turns to some waiting men, new recruits.

Billings, nearby, reads A POSTED BROADSHEET that

announces:  "Reward Offered:  For the capture or death of

the rebel known as 'The Swamp Fox'".

He tears it down and walks over to Marion.

REED, the sturdiest of the lot offers his hand to Marion.

The others nod in agreement.

The recruits head off.  Billings hands Marion the wanted

poster which Marion glances at and crumbles up.

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SQUARE

Gabriel and several of Marion's men take supplies from

Green, Anne, and some other townspeople.  Gabriel looks at

Anne.

She gives him a bit of a smile.  He checks out her teeth.

She tries to glare but she can't help but laugh.

MARION AND BILLINGS watch as Anne gives Gabriel some

apples which he tosses into the air, one-by-one, catching

them behind his back, a cocky move, executed with a

disarming smile that makes Anne laugh again.  Marion

smiles at his son's flirtation.  Billings smiles as well.

Billings is taken aback by the gentleness of Marion's

words.

Billings nods.

Marion hears himself and pulls his eyes from Gabriel,

adopting a coarse, joking tone.

They mount up, grateful to leave the sincerity behind.

Gabriel sees Marion and his men starting to ride off.  He

says goodbye to Anne, then RUNS TO HIS HORSE, MOUNTING

WITH A DRAMATIC LEAP.  He GALLOPS up, taking his place at

his father's side.  Marion doesn't turn to look at him,

but he knows he's there.

EXT.  CAROLINA ROAD - DAY

A patchwork of fields with a village visible in the

distance.  The ROLLINS BOYS, 10 and 12, work a field,

harvesting grain.  Hearing the SOUND OF HORSES' HOOVES,

they stop and listen.

Then they see a CLOUD OF DUST rising over the ridge line.

Growing excited, they throw down their scythes and race

down the hillside, madly stumbling and falling, trying to

intersect the approaching sound.

At the bottom of the hill they pass their father, BEN

ROLLINS, who watches his sons plant themselves on the side

of the road, gazing in awe at:

MARION AND HIS MEN, THUNDERING BY.  They're an impressive

sight, a hundred-and-fifty heavily armed men, on powerful

mounts, raising a cloud of dust as they gallop down the

road.

EXT.  CHARLESTON ROAD - DAY

Marion and forty of his men, including Gabriel, sit on

their motionless horses in the middle of the road.  There

are a number of new faces among Marion's men, among them

Ben Rollins.  Gabriel is lost in thought.

Gabriel sighs.  They hear a SOUND APPROACHING, then see

two British wagons round a curve with a guard of only SIX

REDCOATS, commanded by a REDCOAT SERGEANT.  The Redcoat

Sergeant signals stop.

The young Redcoat privates nervously UNSHOULDER THEIR

MUSKETS.

Marion's surprised by the Sergeant's order.

Marion sighs and lets loose with a PIERCING WHISTLE.  The

underbrush parts and more of Marion's men show themselves,

MUSKETS LEVELED at the outnumbered Redcoats.

Marion exchanges a look with Rev. Oliver who, like Marion,

doesn't want to kill these men.  Seeing no other option,

Marion turns to give the order, then stops, hearing a

FAINT BARELY DETECTABLE, RUMBLING SOUND...

A moment later Brother Joseph hears it as well... HORSES

HOOVES, LOTS OF THEM, growing louder by the second,

THUNDERING toward them from the road behind the British

wagons...

Then, the SOUND OF MORE HORSES, coming in fast on both

flanks.

The canvas sides of the British wagons are THROWN UP and

DOZENS OF REDCOATS, armed with muskets, spill out...

Marion's unmounted men run to their horses, LEAPING into

their saddles...

Then GREEN DRAGOONS appear, galloping down the wooded

slopes on both flanks, astonishing horsemen, weaving

through the trees without slacking their pace, SWORDS

DRAWN, PISTOLS PRIMED...

A THUNDEROUS VOLLEY ERUPTS from the Redcoat infantry,

KILLING several of Marion's men...

Marion's men FIRE BACK from their BUCKING MOUNTS, most of

their shots going awry...

Behind the British wagons, a huge detachment of GREEN

DRAGOONS appears, TARLETON among them...

MARION SEES THE DRAGOONS BUT NOT TARLETON HIMSELF...

MARION AND HIS MEN spur their mounts, taking off down the

road in the opposite direction...

The FLANKING BODIES OF DRAGOONS gallop out of the woods,

JOINING THE MAIN BODY, riding in hard pursuit...

EXT.  WOODED ROAD - DAY

Marion and his men GALLOP down the road.  The much larger

body of Green Dragoons THUNDER after them.

EXT.  BLACK SWAMP ROAD - DAY

Marion and his men ride along a raised road that drops off

into Black Swamp on either side...

They ROUND A CURVE AND STOP, reining back their horses in

confusion as they see:

FIFTY GREEN DRAGOONS heading straight toward them...

THE DRAGOONS OPEN FIRE from both directions, KILLING

several more of Marion's men, WOUNDING others...

Marion's men FIRE BACK as best they can, caught in the

CHAOS OF BUCKING AND FALLING HORSES and WOUNDED AND

DISMOUNTED MEN...

They remount, doubling-up with the wounded...

MARION sees an unaided wounded man.  LEAPS FROM HIS

HORSE, heaves him onto his horse, slaps it...

Marion's men head off both sides of the road into the

swamp, struggling with their mounts as they hit the knee-

deep water...

Marion on foot with four men, only three horses... A

DRAGOON, aiming his pistol, THUNDERS down on Marion...

MARION FIRES, killing the Dragoon...

Marion's men mount, one motions to Marion...

Marion's men ride off, leaving him ALONE... a Dragoon is

almost on him, SWORD RAISED.  Marion, his weapon spent,

sees a thick branch on the ground, two feet long... grabs

it...

The sword flashes and SINKS DEEPLY INTO THE WOOD... Marion

YANKS, brings the rider off his horse, grabs the reins and

SWINGS HIMSELF UP INTO THE EMPTY SADDLE.  Marion rides

down the embankment...

The Dragoons rein back, slowed by the dead horses and men.

They spur their reluctant mounts over the bodies and

follow Marion and his men into the swamp...

EXT.  BLACK SWAMP - DAY

MARION RIDES HARD, galloping along a circuitous, barely

visible dry trail... A MOMENT LATER, Tarleton and Green

Dragoons follow...

EXT.  DEEP IN THE SWAMPS - EVENING

MARION CATCHES UP to a dozen of his men, including Gabriel

and Billings.  Several of the men are badly wounded,

barely clinging to their saddles...

They ride through the shallow water, get to a fork, SPLIT

UP.  As they disappear into the swamp, the sounds of their

horses are swallowed up in the LOUD BUZZING OF SWAMP

INSECTS and the CRIES OF THE SWAMP BIRDS...

A moment later, Tarleton and the vanguard of Dragoons ride

up.  Tarleton signals stop at the fork...

Looks... nothing.  Listens... nothing.  Chooses a path,

the one Marion took.  Rides off, the Dragoons following...

EXT.  DEEPER IN THE SWAMPS - NIGHT

Darker still.  Tarleton and his men come to a dead end,

blocked by a heavy tangle of huge swamp ferns and thorn

bushes.

They rein back their horses, stopping in a confused mess.

Tarleton calls to Gaskins and the Loyalist scouts.

Tarleton makes his own choice... rides off... the Green

Dragoons follow, the Loyalists bring up the rear.

EXT.  SWAMP MORASS - NIGHT

Tarleton and his mounted Dragoons struggle through a

nearly impassable morass of swamp-grass, reeds and

swarming mosquitoes...

The exhausted Dragoons are wet, covered with mud, and

bleeding from swamp briars.  The horses are spent and

foaming...

Tarleton struggles harder than any, but finally even he

has had enough.  He reins back his horse.

Tarleton glares into the impenetrable darkness of plant-

choked water and swamp...

Tarleton yanks on his reins, turns his horse and starts

back the way they came.  His grateful men turn their

horses and follow.

IN THE UNDERGROWTH, Marion, Gabriel, Billings and three

badly wounded men, with only four horses between them,

calm their mounts...

They can hear, but not see the Dragoons.  Then, through

the thick undergrowth, MARION CATCHES A GLIMPSE OF

TARLETON...

Gabriel, tending the wounded men, sees his father lock his

eyes on Tarleton...

Marion quickly opens his weapons pouch and pulls out one

of the bullets he made from Thomas' lead soldiers.

Walking to his horse, Marion loads...

Marion mounts, scanning the terrain, planning a route...

As Marion spurs his horse to ride after Tarleton, Gabriel

grabs the bridle.  He YANKS HARD, stopping Marion's horse

dead.  THE HORSE BUCKS, nearly throwing Marion...

MARION SPURS THE HORSE which tries to respond but is

JERKED BACK AGAIN by Gabriel.  Marion angrily turns on his

son...

Gabriel looks up at his father, never loosening his iron

grip on the bridles but speaking softly, almost

pleadingly:

Marion looks down at Gabriel.  Then Marion looks over at

Billings and the three wounded men...

One bleeds from an ugly neck wound... their shared mounts

are nearly spent...

Marion takes a last look in the direction of the departing

Tarleton.  Then he dismounts and hurries over to help the

wounded.  Gabriel watches his father for a moment, then

joins him with the wounded.

EXT.  WOODED GLEN - NIGHT

Dark.  Marion and his battered men gather, taking stock.

Men drift in, mounted and on foot in ones and twos, past

wary sentries.  GABRIEL RIDES UP, dismounts and reports to

Marion, out of earshot of the other men.

Marion is silent.

The parental-sounding formality of Gabriel's words brings

a thin smile to Marion's face.

Marion smiles, nods a silent thanks to his son and heads

over to help with the wounded.

EXT.  MARION'S ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT

A cold, winter rain falls.  Most of Marion's grim men are

huddled in lean-to's and around campfires.  Green and

several other Pembroke townspeople unload a wagon of

supplies while Marion, Scott and Fielding stow the

provisions.

Gabriel and Anne sit at a fire, under the cover of a lean-

to, taking quietly.  He's troubled.  She tries to be

hopeful.

She takes a pot off the campfire and pours him a cup of

tea.

He nods and takes a drink of the tea.  She smiles.

Gabriel smiles back to her, revealing a mouthful of ink-

stained, black teeth.  Before she has time to laugh...

ROLLINS RIDES HARD INTO CAMP.  Marion hurries over,

accompanied by the Great Danes.  The other men gather

around.

Marion isn't as surprised as Gabriel.  He is, however,

taken aback by Gabriel's black teeth.  Gabriel notices

everyone looking at his mouth.

Anne is embarrassed and regretful, seeing her joke fly in

the face of the troubling news.

EXT.  FORT CAROLINA - DAY

A REDCOAT SENTRY sees a lone figure on horseback ride out

of distant woods.  It's Rev. Oliver, carrying a white flag

with one hand, holding a dispatch case in the other.  The

sentry calls to the Commander of the Watch.

INT.  CORNWALLIS' HEADQUARTERS - FORT CAROLINA - DAY

A temporary HQ has been set up in a commandeered

farmhouse.  Cornwallis stands uncomfortably while a tailor

measures him and marks alterations on a partially

completed uniform.  Tarleton enters.

Cornwallis reads the message.

EXT.  CAROLINA ROAD - DAY

Marion rides, trailed by Cornwallis' Great Danes.  Behind

him, two dozen heavily armed Patriots, including Rev.

Oliver who carries a white flag.

A detachment of Redcoat Cavalry, lead by Major Halbert,

waits.  The Redcoats fall in on either side.  They ride

on.

EXT.  FORT CAROLINA - DAY

Redcoat sentries see the approaching Patriots and Redcoats

and open the gates.  Billings and the other Patriots stop,

a hundred yards outside the barricades.

MARION alone rides through the gates, flanked by the

British cavalry, the Great Danes following closely behind.

INT.  CORNWALLIS' HEADQUARTERS - DAY

Major Halbert ushers Marion in.  The Great Danes follow

sniffing curiously, sensing something or someone.

Major Halbert turns and starts to stride out.

Major Halbert stops.

Major Halbert sneers and strides from the room.  MARION

ALONE, EXCEPT FOR THE DOGS, allows himself a fleeting

smile.  Then he looks around the room.  He notes a rocking

chair.  Curious, he hefts it.  Too heavy.  He puts it

down, sits and rocks.  The dogs walk over and lay at his

feet.

INT.  CORNWALLIS' HEADQUARTERS - DAY (LATER)

Marion patiently sits rocking.  One of the dogs has its

head in his lap and Marion scratches it behind the ears.

INT.  CORNWALLIS' HEADQUARTERS - DAY

A stone-faced Marion stands in the center of the room,

playing with the dogs.  One of the dogs jumps up, putting

its front legs on Marion's shoulders, and licks his face.

Just then, Cornwallis walks in, overjoyed to see his dogs.

The dogs just look at Cornwallis.  He holds out his arms,

waiting for them to rush to him.  They look up at Marion

who nods to them.

The dogs run to Cornwallis and nuzzle him in a friendly

but not enthusiastic manner.  Cornwallis pats them

vigorously, too vigorously for the moderate level of joy

the dogs are showing at their reunion.

TARLETON ENTERS with four Dragoons, all armed...

Marion freezes...

Marion and Tarleton lock eyes.  Marion searches for some

sign that Tarleton recognizes him.  There's none.

Tarleton nods.

Marion, like ice, looks Tarleton up and down.  Then he

slowly turns and looks at the four Dragoons, two on either

side of Tarleton.  Marion measures the odds and finds them

wanting.

With a supreme effort of will, Marion forces himself to

turn from Tarleton to Cornwallis and the matter at hand.

Cornwallis is surprised.  He exchanges a look with

Tarleton.

Cornwallis is surprised.

Cornwallis sighs.

Marion steps to the window, checks the view.  A wooded

hillside is visible in the distance.  Marion reaches into

his jacket...

The Dragoons move on him...

Marion extracts not a weapon, but a spyglass, which he

hands to Cornwallis.

Cornwallis looks through the spyglass.

VIEW THROUGH THE SPYGLASS

Though difficult to see clearly through the shimmering

haze, Cornwallis can just make out a row of bound Redcoat

officers, with Patriot soldiers holding muskets at their

heads.

CORNWALLIS turns coldly to Marion.

Cornwallis glares at Marion.

Marion can't help but laugh at the insult.

Cornwallis turns to Colonel Huntington.

Colonel Huntington leaves to do so.

Marion salutes Cornwallis who doesn't return the salute.

THEN MARION TURNS TO TARLETON.  He walks up to him and

looks him in the eye.

Tarleton examines Marion's face, finding him familiar, but

unable to place him... then Tarleton remembers...

Tarleton calmly holds Marion's glare.

Marion takes a step closer to Tarleton, then speaks very

softly, very slowly, very clearly.

Marion locks his eyes on Tarleton to make it perfectly

clear that he means what he says.  Tarleton tries to cover

his reaction but it's apparent that he's taken aback by

Marion's icy words.

Marion turns and walks out.  The two Great Danes start to

follow, but Cornwallis SNAPS A COMMAND:

THE DOGS FREEZE, looking after Marion, who doesn't turn

back.  The dogs reluctantly sidle over to Cornwallis'

side.

EXT.  ASSEMBLY YARD - FORT CAROLINA - DAY

Redcoats glare at Marion who sits, mounted, waiting.  His

eighteen men are led out of the prison blockhouse and

directed to waiting horses.  Surprised to be freed, they

mount up.

CORNWALLIS AND TARLETON step out onto the front porch of

Cornwallis' headquarters and watch as Marion and his men

ride toward the gate.

THE TWO GREAT DANES, watch Marion from Cornwallis' side.

Cornwallis motions to the Redcoat Sentries to OPEN THE

GATES.  They do so and Marion and his men, without

hurrying, ride out.

Then, just as the gates are closing behind him, Marion,

without turning around, lets loose with a PIERCING

WHISTLE...

THE TWO GREAT DANES INSTANTLY RACE AFTER MARION, making it

through the gates just as they're closing.

CORNWALLIS, seeing his dogs run after Marion, SPUTTERS,

then turns and storms back into his quarters.

TARLETON, still off-balance from Marion's parting

statement, watches Marion ride away.  Then he turns to

Major Wilkins who stands nearby.

Wilkins hurries off.

EXT.  HILLSIDE CLEARING - ABOVE FORT CAROLINA - DAY

Major Wilkins and a detachment of Green Dragoons ride up

the wooded slope toward the bound Redcoat officers that

Cornwallis saw through the spyglass.  As the Dragoons ride

out of the trees into the clearing they stop dead, seeing

that:

THE "REDCOAT OFFICERS" are not real -- they're nothing

more than SCARECROWS IN REDCOAT UNIFORMS.  There's no sign

of Marion or his men.

INT.  CORNWALLIS' HEADQUARTERS - FORT CAROLINA - DAY

CLOSE SHOT:  One of the "Redcoat Officers," stuffed with

straw is thrown onto Cornwallis' desk by Tarleton.

Cornwallis looks at the scarecrow, then turns to Tarleton.

EXT.  POND BLUFF - DAY

Tarleton and Wilkins wait while Green Dragoons and

Loyalists search the remains of Marion's house and barn.

Gaskins, filthy from the ashes, walks up to Tarleton.

EXT.  CHARLOTTE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A thick ground fog surrounds Charlotte's house.  The soft

lights of candles glow in the windows.  All appears

peaceful.

Then, the SHADOWED FIGURES of THREE DOZEN GREEN DRAGOONS

appear out of the mist, silently approaching the house on

foot.

INT.  CHARLOTTE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A fire crackles in the fireplace.  A curtain blows in the

open window.  THE DOOR BURSTS OPEN.  WINDOWS BREAK.  Green

Dragoons pour into the house, muskets brandished.  No sign

of occupants.  CAPTAIN MORROW barks a command:

The Dragoons THUNDER UP THE STAIRS... Tarleton and Wilkins

stride in, watching the search... the parlor... nothing...

The kitchen... food is cooking...

The dining room... the table is set, half-eaten food is on

the plates, abandoned in mid-meal.  TARLETON WALKS INTO

THE DINING ROOM, touches some of the food, gauging its

warmth.

The Dragoons race outside.

EXT.  CHARLOTTE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

A TORCH BURNS.  A dozen Dragoons light torches off of it

and fan out to search.  The thick fog turns the torches

into diffused, floating balls of light, turning the

Dragoons into ghost-like apparitions.

CAMERA FOLLOWS ONE OF THE TORCHES, carried by a

particularly rough-looking Dragoon who skirts the edge of

the underbrush closest to the house.  As the torch moves,

its flame sends long shadows and shafts of light into the

underbrush...

The CAMERA STOPS to reveal, in the brush, TWO FACES,

GABRIEL AND CHARLOTTE, dark, motionless, watching the

search.  Behind them, MARION'S OTHER CHILDREN, Nathan,

Samuel, Margaret, William and Susan...

Around them, SEVERAL MORE OF MARION'S MEN, including ABNER

BROWN, weapons ready.  The moving lights play on their

faces.

AT THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE, the torches converge,

illuminating Tarleton who gives the unheard order.  The

torches fan out and begin SETTING FIRE TO THE HOUSE, BARNS

AND OUTBUILDINGS.

MARGARET grips Charlotte's arm.  Gabriel motions and they

all ease back, disappearing into the brush.

EXT.  SHANTY TOWN - NIGHT

A compound of rude shacks, built of scraps of lumber and

rough-hewn logs, stands on the side of the Magpie River.

Marion's men wait with the children while Abner, Charlotte

and Gabriel, flanked by Aaron and Abigail, Marion's

middle-aged, black servants, seen in the opening sequence,

talk with several stern-looking, middle-aged, black

FREEDMEN.

The conversation, which is out of the children's earshot,

is testy, with one of the middle-aged freedmen

particularly troubled.

Marion's stone-faced children look around, appraising

their surroundings, registering the poverty of the shanty

town.

THE DISCUSSION BETWEEN THE GROWN-UPS ends with a guarded

exchange of handshakes.  Gabriel, Charlotte, Abner, Aaron

and Abigail rejoin the children and Marion's men.

They follow Aaron, down an alley to A SHACK.  Small.

Barely standing.  The children stop in their tracks,

knowing this is to be their new home.

Charlotte sees their hesitation.  She walks up to the

little structure, examining it with a critical eye.  She

looks on the doorway, seeing a single room, a dirt floor,

wax-paper instead of glass in the windows, a rude,

chimney-less fire-pit against the back wall.  She smiles.

She turns to Aaron and Abigail.

Charlotte walks inside without looking back.  The children

hesitate, then follow her inside.

INT.  SHACK - SHANTY TOWN - NIGHT

The children help Aaron and Abigail make beds out of

armloads of hay.  OUTSIDE, Charlotte and Gabriel talk

quietly.

Gabriel searches for an honest answer.

Gabriel steps over to his saddlebags, opens his pack and

pulls out a stack of letters which he hands to Charlotte.

They sense someone behind them.

Gabriel is astonished to hear words coming from his

heretofore silent sister.  Charlotte nods, smiling.

Susan says nothing.  Gabriel continues, hopefully.

Gabriel kneels down and embraces her.  She stands coldly

with her arms at her sides.

EXT.  MARION'S ENCAMPMENT - DAY

An astonished Marion talks to Gabriel.

The cloud passes quickly.

Gabriel hesitates.

Gabriel nods.

Marion shakes his head at the thought, smiling to himself.

Gabriel, uncomfortable with the lie, changes the subject.

Marion nods and curiously follows Gabriel.

EXT.  PEMBROKE VILLAGE - NIGHT

Dark.  The village square is deserted.  Marion follows

Gabriel into the shadow of the village church.  They

dismount, tie up their horses and enter the back door of

the church.

INT.  CHURCH - PEMBROKE VILLAGE - NIGHT

Marion walks in and stops dead.  At the altar of the small

sanctuary, HALF-A-DOZEN PEOPLE stand with Rev. Oliver.  At

the center of the tiny gathering is Anne Green, flanked by

her parents.

Marion is stunned but recovers quickly.

They share a moment, then head down the aisle.  Marion

greets Anne's parents, shaking hands with her father and

bowing to her mother.  Abner, at the door, nods that the

coast is clear.

MARION feels every word, looking straight ahead but

knowing that he's standing next to his son.

EXT.  CHURCH - NIGHT

In the shadows behind the church, the bride and groom say

goodbye to the wedding party.  Anne talks quietly with her

parents.  Marion and Gabriel talk nearby.

They're silent for a moment.

Gabriel nods, then turns to his horse, unnecessarily

checking his pack ropes.  Anne joins them.  Marion

embraces her and gives her a fatherly kiss.

He helps her mount up.  Abner, on guard near the road,

motions them on.  They all watch as Gabriel and Anne ride

off.

EXT.  WOODED ROAD - NIGHT

Marion, Rev. Oliver and Abner ride slowly down the road.

It's a beautiful, moonlit night.  Marion breaks the

silence, speaking as much for himself as the others.

Marion nods.  They ride on.

EXT.  SOUTH CAROLINA SHORE - DAY

A British packet, a small, fast warship, lies anchored

just offshore.  A rowboat, manned by half-a-dozen sailors,

carrying a Redcoat Lieutenant, beaches.  Several Redcoats

wait.

The Lieutenant, carrying a dispatch case, jumps out off

the boat, mounts a waiting horse and rides off.

EXT.  SMALL BRITISH FORT - DAY

Cornwallis, with his command staff clustered around him,

sits on horseback reading the dispatch as the dispatch

rider waits.  They're on a hillside, looking over the

burned-out remains of a small British fort as some

Redcoats pull the Union Jack out of a trench latrine.

Cornwallis motions Tarleton and they ride a few yards from

the other officers and speak, out of earshot.

Tarleton smiles slightly, enjoying the show.

Cornwallis grows eerily calm and turns to Tarleton.

Cornwallis takes a moment, then speaks simply.

Tarleton salutes, yanks his reins, turning his horse, and

rides off.

EXT.  SMALL FARMHOUSE - SUNSET

Tarleton lounges in the grass on a slope in front of a

farmhouse, looking out at a lovely sunset, absentmindedly

picking at the petals of some wildflowers.  A HIDEOUS

SCREAM pierces the calm.

Tarleton analytically evaluates the tenor of the scream,

then rises, passing several Green Dragoons who wait with

their horses in front of the farmhouse.

IN THE FARMHOUSE

Blood is smeared on one wall, where half-a-dozen corpses

lie in a jumbles mass on the floor.

In the parlor, Tarleton walks past more bodies, including

a dead woman who lies protectively but ineffectually over

the bloody bodies of her two young children, both under

eight-years-old.

In the kitchen, Tarleton finds Wilkins, some Green

Dragoons, and Gaskins, the Loyalist Militia commander and

some of his low-life men.

Rob Fielding, one of the craftsmen in Marion's force, is

tied, spread-eagle to the table, showing the terrible

effects of PROTRACTED TORTURE.  Wilkins and Gaskins are

nervous and apologetic as Tarleton walks into the room.

Tarleton sighs, irritated.

Gaskins and a couple of his men step into an attached

woodshed where Billings sits, bound.  They roughly grab

him and drag him into the kitchen.

They tie Billings to the table.

INT.  SMALL FARMHOUSE - DAY

Silence.  A tiny rivulet of blood runs along a plank in

the floor, disappearing into a gap between two

floorboards.

Marion, Dalton, Rev. Oliver, and several other men walk

slowly through the farmhouse, in stunned silence.

Marion sees the body of the mother, draped over her two

young children.  Marion turns to Rev. Oliver who can only

stare, offering no solace.

They pass Fielding's body, then enter the kitchen and see

BILLINGS, DEAD, still tied to the table.  Marion reels.

EXT.  SMALL FARMHOUSE - DAY

Marion's men dig graves.  Marion watches.  Dalton steps up

next to him.

Marion doesn't answer.  Gabriel GALLOPS up.  He reins back

his lathered horse and speaks to them without dismounting.

Rollins doesn't pause.  He rushes to his horse, mounts up

and rides off.  Marion and the other men mount up and ride

off fast after him.

EXT.  BLACK RIVER ROAD - DAY

Marion his brigade catch up to Rollins and ride on with

him.

EXT.  ROLLINS' FARM - DAY

The small farm seen earlier, surrounded by hills, where

the two boys, Rollins' sons ran down the hillside to catch

a glimpse of the passing Marion and his brigade.

The house smolders.  No sign of life.  Gabriel, Abner and

a few other men warily ride the perimeter of the cleared

area around the house.

Marion, at the head of the rest of the brigade, waits next

to an increasingly frantic, Rollins.  They see Gabriel

wave, signaling all clear.

MARION, ROLLINS AND THE OTHER MEN RIDE to the house.

Rollins is the first to see THE BODIES.  Horrified, he

reins back and dismounts, almost falling.

His TWO SONS, WIFE, an OLDER MAN and WOMAN, lie dead in

the dirt.  Marion's men silently watch Rollins' agony.

Weeping and confused, he moves in a mad, staccato manner,

as if he were a marionette, whose strings were being

jerked by a drunken puppeteer.

Marion and Rev. Oliver dismount and move toward him.

Rollins sees them coming.  He hardens and strides to his

horse, pulling his FLINTLOCK PISTOL from his saddle

holster.

Rev. Oliver reaches out to embrace Rollins.

ROLLINS PUTS THE PISTOL TO HIS HEAD AND PULLS THE TRIGGER,

BLOWING HIS BRAINS OUT.

Every man freezes in place.  For a long moment no one

moves, no one speaks.  Then Marion pulls himself together

and addresses the men:

The men mount up.  Marion and Gabriel ride off together.

EXT.  PEMBROKE - NIGHT

Marion scans the night as Gabriel and Anne mount up.  The

three of them ride off, pulling a line of horses, some

heavily loaded packhorses and some saddled but empty

mounts.

EXT.  SHACK - SHANTY TOWN - NIGHT

Dark.  Quiet.  Gabriel and Anne wait in the shadows while

Marion cocks his musket, checks his pistols and walks

slowly toward the shack.

He warily checks every shadow.  No one anywhere.  Then a

SOUND -- A SQUEAL OF LAUGHTER, immediately followed by:

MARION'S CHILDREN RACE OUT OF THE SHADOWS to Marion.  He's

practically bowled over as Margaret, Nathan, Samuel and

William fling themselves into his arms.

CHARLOTTE STEPS OUT OF THE SHADOWS, watching the reunion

as Marion covers the children with kisses, trying to hug

all of them at once as they cling to him as if they'll

never let go.  MARION AND CHARLOTTE LOCK EYES over the

heads of the children.

Charlotte smiles.  Then Marion notices SUSAN peeking out

from behind Charlotte's patched and mended skirt.  He

kneels down and opens his arms to her but she doesn't

move.

He smiles to her and speaks softly:

She looks coldly at Marion, tightens her grip on

Charlotte's skirt and retreats further behind her.  Marion

looks to Charlotte who nods with guarded reassurance.

Then his attention is drawn away by the demanding embraces

of his other children.

EXT.  CHERAW FALLS PATH - NIGHT

Marion rides, leading his children, Charlotte and Anne up

a steep, narrow path that cuts through a heavily wooded

hillside.

EXT.  CHERAW FALLS - NIGHT

The remains of a tiny abandoned backcountry farm.  The

house is gone, leaving only an overgrown cellar hole.

Nearby is a barely-standing tobacco shed, one end of which

has fallen to the ground.  A SOFT WIND WHISTLES AND

WHISPERS through the gaps in the rough-hewn boards of the

structure.

Marion rides up to the edge of the clearing.  A

MOCKINGBIRD SCREECHES nearby, startling him.  He looks

back at the children, worried, anticipating a negative

reaction.  Margaret smiles and turns to the other

children, speaking for Marion's benefit.

The children smile and dismount.

INT.  TOBACCO SHED - NIGHT

POURING RAIN.  The ceiling drips.  Marion lies, awake,

with his children huddled against him, sleeping in one of

the few dry spots.  They're covered with tattered quilts.

On the other side of the children, Charlotte is also

awake.  She and Marion exchange a long, silent look in the

darkness, over the heads of the sleeping children.

EXT.  WATERFALL OVERLOOK - DAY

Marion walks the perimeter of their encampment with Nathan

and Samuel.  They listen carefully.

They follow Marion like soldiers.

EXT.  CHERAW FALLS - DAY

Marion sits on a rock while Margaret cuts his hair.  She

takes her time, touching him on the head and shoulders,

extending the process.  Marion, sits back, enjoying it.

He notices Susan, nearby, watching silently.  He smiles.

She turns away.

EXT.  TOBACCO SHED - CHERAW FALLS - DAY

Dark.  Shafts of light shine in through the holes in the

roof.  Marion, standing in the shadows, senses someone

coming.  He freezes.

A figure rounds the corner.  It's... William.  MARION

YELLS William SQUEALS IN DELIGHT, then chases his father

around the corner, tagging him.  They laugh.  Marion

covers his eyes and William dashes off to hide.

EXT.  CHERAW FALLS - RIVERSIDE - DAY

Marion sits on the side of the river with Susan who avoids

looking at him.  Using the knife we've seen him use in

battle he cuts slices off an apple and eats them.

No response.

He cuts a slice and offers it to her.  She doesn't take

it.  He puts the slice between them.  After a long moment

she picks it up but as she's about to eat it, she stops,

seeing something on it.  She puts it back.

Marion looks at the apple slice and sees a dark red

splotch on it.  He looks at his knife and realizes that

it's dried blood.

Off-balance, he turns to Susan who stares straight ahead,

a thousand miles from Marion.

EXT.  CHERAW FALLS RIVER - DAY

Marion washes the knife carefully, almost obsessively.

Anne steps up behind him.

Marion finishes with the knife and puts it away without

explanation.

She speaks with a sly, withheld smile.

Anne smiles and walks away.  Marion figures out what she

just told him.

Marion laughs at the thought.

EXT.  CHERAW FALLS - DAY

Marion's children swim and play with the two Great Danes

in the pond at the base of the falls, along with Gabriel

and Anne.  Marion and Charlotte sit on the bank, watching

them.

Charlotte turns and looks at Marion for a long moment.

He's unaware.  As Charlotte looks at him, her smile

disappears, replaced by anger.  She snaps at Marion.

Startled, Marion turns to Charlotte.

She turns from him.  Marion, tries to figure out what just

happened.  After a long moment he gets it.  Stunned at

first, his gears turn.  After a very thoughtful moment he

turns to Charlotte and offers a tentative smile.  She

rolls her eyes.

EXT.  CHERAW FALLS - NIGHT

Dark.  A full moon shines.

INT.  TOBACCO SHED - NIGHT

Marion wakes.  He looks across his sleeping children and

sees that Charlotte isn't in her place on the other side

of them.  He rises and walks out into the night.

EXT.  GLEN - CHERAW FALLS - NIGHT

Marion walks into the glen.  He tenses, sensing someone in

front of him.  Then he sees CHARLOTTE AT THE EDGE OF THE

WOODS.  Neither one speaks...

They walk silently to each other.  They stop, looking at

each other closely, as if seeing one another for the first

time...

Only then do they kiss.  The kiss grows more passionate...

then much more passionate...

EXT.  CHERAW FALLS - DAY

Marion finishes tying his gear onto his horse.  The

children are silent.  He stands beside his horse.  One

after another, the children walk to him and embrace him --

Nathan, Samuel, Margaret, William.

He sees Susan, standing next to Charlotte.  He motions to

her but she doesn't move.  Then he kneels down and gently

hugs her.

Susan remains silent, standing with her arms at her sides,

not responding to the embrace.

Finally, Marion lets go of her.  She just stares at him.

Marion stands and turns to Charlotte.

They embrace.  Though the hug is chaste, their eyes tell a

different story.  Only Anne and Margaret notice, but to

them it's as clear as a bell.  They exchange a knowing

look.

Marion and Charlotte break apart, self-consciously.

Marion and Gabriel mount up and start to ride away.  As

they're about to round a curve and disappear, SUSAN CRIES

OUT:

With halting steps, then faster and faster, she runs down

the path toward Marion.

Marion stops, turning in his saddle to see Susan running

after him, her eyes filled with tears.

Marion yanks his reins, turning his horse.

Marion spurs his horse straight toward her, GALLOPING

toward the running, crying child.

MARION RIDES TOWARD HER...

Charlotte, Anne and Marion's children watch as:

MARION LEANS OVER IN THE SADDLE without slowing down...

SWOOPING HER INTO HIS LAP...

She sits astride the saddle, facing him, her arms wrapped

around him, pleading, the words tumbling from her, as fast

as she can get them out...

Marion envelopes the sobbing wisp of a girl, holding her,

letting her cry, fighting his own tears...

He reins back the horse, stopping in front of the

others...

He pleadingly looks to Charlotte who steps up to the

horse... to take Susan...

Marion gives Susan a final embrace, and covers her face

with kisses...

Marion hands the still crying Susan down to Charlotte...

Marion, in agony, averts his eyes, yanks his reins, and

spurs his horse...

As he rides away the children take off after him, running.

Susan seeing the others running after Marion, struggles

out of Charlotte's arms, and runs after them as well...

Marion rides, now joined by Gabriel, faster and faster,

leaving a trail of dust...

The children slow, then stop, one after another, watching

as they ride away.

EXT.  PATRIOT ENCAMPMENT - ACWORTH - EVENING

Grim.  The most rudimentary of the encampments we've seen.

Rain pours.  Some of Marion's men huddle under lean-to's

and quickly rigged tents that offer only partial

protection from the cold rain.

Abner and Scott do their best to keep a wet-wood fire

going.  Rev. Oliver tries to cook.

Marion and Gabriel ride up and dismount.  Marion joins

Rev. Oliver.

Marion nods.  He and Gabriel join some of the men under

one of the lean-to's.

EXT.  RIVERSIDE - DAY

The rain has stopped.  The ground is still wet.  It's

spring.  The first buds are on the maple trees.  A fox

tentatively comes out of its winter den, followed by a

pair of pups.

Marion stands on the side of a river, looking up at a

chevron of Canadian geese flying north.

EXT.  PEMBROKE - DAY

The Canadian Geese fly over Anne who is behind her

father's store, tying food and provisions to a couple of

packhorses.  A mare and a foal cavort in a nearby paddock.

Suddenly Anne senses someone behind her and turns to see

HALF-A DOZEN REDCOATS.  She's initially frightened but the

REDCOAT SERGEANT, speaks politely.

The Redcoat Sergeant deferentially motions for Anne to

follow him and his men.  She sees several other

townspeople, with Redcoat escorts, already heading down

the street.  She follows along.

EXT.  PEMBROKE VILLAGE SQUARE - DAY

Tarleton and Wilkins, on horseback, watch as a large,

mixed detachment of Green Dragoons and Redcoat Infantry

directs the villagers into the church.

One of the Redcoats walks out of the general store with a

bowl of gumdrops.  As he starts giving them to a few of

the children their parents waver, unsure of the gesture,

but they reluctantly allow the children to take the candy.

The townspeople are uneasy but they follow the orders of

the Redcoats who, though carry muskets, are polite and

unthreatening.

Tarleton sees the last of the townspeople enter the

church.  He nods to the Redcoats near the door.

The Redcoats CLOSE THE DOORS, chaining them shut.  The

DOOR IS POUNDED ON from the inside.

TARLETON NODS TO GASKINS who, along with several rough-

looking LOYALIST MILITIAMEN, disappear into the blacksmith

shop.  They reappear a moment later with FLAMING TORCHES

and approach the church.

Several Redcoats see what's about to happen and are

appalled.  Even some of the Green Dragoons, including

Wilkins, are troubled.  Wilkins rides over to Tarleton.

Gaskins and the Loyalist Militia stop around the church,

torches ready, waiting for the final go-ahead from

Tarleton.  The POUNDING AND CALLING from inside the church

grows louder.

The Redcoats turn to the Redcoat Officers.  The Redcoat

officers turn to Wilkins, who struggles with himself.

Tarleton calmly watches Wilkins' distress.

Finally, Wilkins accepts it.  Weakly steadying his horse,

he takes his place next to Tarleton.

The Redcoats and Dragoons follow his lead and watch as

Gaskins and the Loyalist Militiamen light the church on

fire, heaving their torches onto the roof, through the

windows and under the raised foundation.

SCREAMS are heard from inside.  The DOOR THUDS with the

shoulders of men trying to escape.  The CHAINS HOLD.

As the FLAMES RISE, another group of Loyalist Militiamen

and some Redcoats drag half-a-dozen young women out of a

side-street...

Among the women, desperately pleading, kicking and

screaming, is ANNE...

The men drag her and the other women into the livery

stable...

Tarleton watches them carried off, stone-faced...

Then he turns and watches the church go up in FLAMES...

A WINDOW SHATTERS, with a chair heaved from inside...

SOME MEN TRY TO CLIMB OUT, but waiting Redcoats FIRE THEIR

MUSKETS POINT BLANK...

KILLING THREE MEN, driving the others back...

The SCREAMS FROM INSIDE THE CHURCH grow louder...

The FLAMES AND SMOKE RISE...

EXT.  WOODS - PEMBROKE OUTSKIRTS - DAY

SILENCE.  A dark forest of old growth trees.  No

underbrush.  Marion and a couple dozen of his men,

including Gabriel, Rev. Oliver, and Dalton ride warily on

a carpet of pine needles toward a thin column of smoke,

visible over the treetops in the distance.

With hand signals, Marion directs his men to fan out.

They do so, weaving through the dark forest, weapons

ready.

EXT.  PEMBROKE - DAY

Marion and his men slowly ride into Pembroke.  The remains

of the church smolder only slightly.  The town is

deserted, no one, dead or alive, is visible.

Unsure what they have found, Marion and his men spread out

and dismount, warily checking out the buildings, looking

for some sign of life.

Rev. Oliver and a few other men head for the charred

remains of the church.

Side-stepping some still-hot, charred beams, Rev. Oliver

looks through the rubble...

Then he sees the bodies...

THE CAMERA CATCHES ONLY A FLEETING GLIMPSE of...

Dozens of charred, blackened bodies, intertwined with the

remains of the church...

Rev. Oliver staggers from the rubble...

The other men see what he has seen...

One-by-one Marion and his men walk over and look into the

remains of the church...

Marion see several charred hands extended through a

shattered window, as if grasping for escape... one of the

hands is tiny, A CHILD'S HAND...

Marion is stunned...

No one says a word...

Dalton and a few of the other men continue the search,

weapons ready...

They step into the livery stable, then walk out a moment

later, ashen faced...

Dalton speaks quietly to Marion, motioning toward an

increasingly frantic Gabriel who has just found Anne's

packhorses...

Gabriel notices the gesture, he watches Marion walk into

the livery stable... Growing more nervous by the second,

Gabriel hurries after his father...

As Gabriel gets to the entrance of the livery stable,

Marion walks out and intercepts him.

Gabriel understands... he reels... growing faint... Marion

grabs him... keeping him from falling...

Marion holds Gabriel who begins to weep...

EXT.  PEMBROKE - DAY

Marion's men, led by Rev. Oliver, tend to the dead.  Some

dig in the small graveyard adjacent to the remains of the

church.  Others carry out the grim task of pulling the

charred bodies out of the rubble.

ON THE EDGE OF TOWN

Marion sits alone.  Gabriel walks up behind him.

Marion shakes his head to himself.

Marion's quiet for a moment.  Then he speaks:

Marion grows quieter with the memory of how bad.

Marion's silent for a moment.

Gabriel is silent.  Marion looks at him closely.

They hear HORSES HOOVES.  Abner rides in from the opposite

side of the village from the church, not having seen the

results of the massacre.  Excited, he dismounts.

Marion and Gabriel just look at him.  Abner is confused by

their reaction.  Then he sees the remains of the church

and the laid out, charred bodies.

EXT.  PATRIOT ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT

Mixed gatherings of Marion's militia and Continentals are

clustered around the campfires, with more Continentals

arriving all the time.

Some of the militiamen and regulars regale each other with

tales of their exploits but most are grim and tired,

talking quietly.

A couple of Patriots play a MELANCHOLY TUNE ON FIFE AND

VIOLIN.

Marion's tent is set up but he's nowhere to be seen.

Gabriel walks to Marion's gear.  Finding Marion's weapon's

belt he opens one of the bullet pouches and finds the

paint-flecked MUSKET BALLS MADE FROM THOMAS' LEAD

SOLDIERS.  As Gabriel takes one, Marion steps up behind

him.

Before Marion can answer they see HARRY LEE RIDE UP TO

THEM.  He dismounts, excited, voluble.  He strides over,

pleased to see Marion, oblivious to his and Gabriel's

mood.

Lee laughs, picks up a bottle and takes a big pull.

Gabriel rises and walks away.  Lee finally tunes into the

pall hanging over Marion and the just departed Gabriel.

He turns to Marion.

Marion nods.  They stand in silence.  Lee hands Marion the

bottle.  He takes a drink.

EXT.  ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT

Dark.  Quiet.  Sentries are on duty.  Marion's tent glows

from a single candle.  He blows the candle out, then steps

out of the tent into the night.

He begins his nightly walk of the perimeter.

Almost immediately, Marion notices something amiss.

Dalton has discovered it at the same time and hurries over

to Marion.

AT ONE OF THE CAMPSITES

Marion and Dalton and several of the other men look down

at some empty bedrolls.

Marion strides to his horse.  The other men follow him.

EXT.  WOODED ROAD - NIGHT

Marion, Dalton and Rev. Oliver and two dozen other men

ride.

EXT.  WOODED ROAD - NIGHT

Dark.  Very quiet.  A moonless night.  Marion and his men,

on foot, make their way along the side of the river.

Brother Joseph hurries out of the darkness and speaks to

Marion.

Suddenly they hear the SOUNDS OF MUSKETS FIRE ahead of

them in the darkness.  Marion takes off at a full run with

his men right behind.

EXT.  OUTSKIRTS OF GREEN DRAGOON ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT

Marion and his men BLAST THROUGH THE BRUSH.  Running

toward the SOUNDS OF THE BATTLE, which grows louder with

every step...

Marion cocks his pistol and extracts his tomahawk on the

run...

The LIGHTS OF THE BATTLE:  The STROBES OF THE MUSKET SHOTS

illuminate the woods ahead of them...

Moving fast, they PASS TWO DEAD BRITISH SENTRIES, without

slowing down...

THEY BLAST OUT OF THE WOODS into...

THE CLEARING, seeing a tableau of TOTAL CHAOS:

Half-dressed GREEN DRAGOONS in formation FIRE IN

VOLLEYS...

Running men.  Scattered MUSKET FIRE.

The strobes of the muskets illuminate RUNNING MEN and

other men in HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT.

WILKINS IS IN COMMAND.  Tarleton is nowhere to be seen.

Gabriel and Abner, both slightly wounded, fight a

desperate holding action...

On the other side of the clearing, a square of Dragoons

forms near Wilkins.

The DRAGOONS FIRE A MASSED VOLLEY, hitting Gabriel, Abner

and several other Patriots.

GABRIEL, BADLY WOUNDED, falls to his knees...

The Dragoons pull their pistols about to fire again.

Marion and his men OPEN FIRE...

Staggering them...

Marion sees Wilkins about to fire at Gabriel...

Marion runs...

Sees another Redcoat about to fire at Gabriel...

MARION KILLS HIM with a pistol shot.

Wilkins cocks his flintlock pistol, aims at Gabriel...

MARION'S ABOUT TO THROW HIS TOMAHAWK... TOO LATE...

WILKINS FIRES... HITTING GABRIEL WHO FLIES BACKWARD...

Marion THROWS THE TOMAHAWK, sinking it into Wilkins'

chest...

The rest of Marion's men thunder into the Dragoons...

Overpowering them...

Marion races to Gabriel...

Throws himself onto the ground next to him...

Cradling him...

Gabriel is stunned, confused by the wounds.

He tries to stand...

Gabriel weakens in Marion's arms... falters... Marion

watches the life drain from Gabriel... He tries to hold

the blood in, to no avail...

Dalton plants himself next to Marion, defending him and

Gabriel...

Marion caresses Gabriel and watches as...

GABRIEL DIES.

The life drains from Marion.  No anger.  Only pain.  He

looks at Gabriel, lost in a dream, an incomprehensible

nightmare of loss and overwhelming emptiness.

EXT.  CLEARING - DAWN

Marion's men finish laying out the bodies of their dead.

The Dragoons are still where they fell.  The Patriots are

laid out in a row, their faces covered by their coats.

Marion sits on the battlefield, next to Gabriel's body.

Dalton gingerly approaches him.

Marion slowly stands and picks up Gabriel's body, cradling

him like a child.  They head off into the brush.

EXT.  PATRIOT ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT

More Continentals have arrived, now outnumbering Marion's

men three-to-one.  The encampment is active.  A few of the

men drink and TALK LOUDLY.  The two men playing the fife

and violin PLAY A MORE VIBRANT TUNE.

INT.  MARION'S TENT - NIGHT

Dark.  Shadowed.  The sounds of celebration can be heard

outside the tent.

Marion sits on his camp chair.  Gabriel lies on the ground

carefully covered up to his chin with a blanket.  A single

candle burns.

Rev. Oliver enters the tent.

No response.

Rev. Oliver pulls up a camp stool.  He and Marion sit in

silence.

EXT.  MARION'S ENCAMPMENT - MORNING

The Patriots, Continentals and Militia, are moving out.

Most of the tents have been taken down.  Wagons are

rolling out.  Companies of Continentals march off in good

order.

MARION'S TENT still stands.  His men finish packing up,

storing their heavy gear in wagons, tying their field gear

onto their horses.

IN THE TENT

Marion still sits.  A FLY BUZZES.  Gabriel's face has

taken on a deathly, ashen look.

Lee enters the tent.  He's silent for a moment, then

speaks softly to Marion.

No response.

Lee moves toward Gabriel's body.

Marion doesn't respond.  Lee waits for a long moment, then

he hears the SOUND OF THE DEPARTING TROOPS OUTSIDE THE

TENT.

He looks at Marion, touches him on the shoulder and walks

out.

EXT.  PATRIOT ENCAMPMENT - DAY

The last of the soldiers move out, leaving their

smoldering campfires and refuse.  The only tent that

remains is Marion's.

EXT.  MARION'S TENT - DAY

Marion sits in his tent, gazing obliquely at Gabriel's

body which has grown even more ashen.  A SOLITARY BIRD

CRIES in the distance.

EXT.  WOODED ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT

A dark, moonless night.  The sky is filled with stars.  A

SOFT WIND BLOWS dead leaves along the ground.  A few of

the leaves are blown through the opening of Marion's tent.

INSIDE THE TENT

Marion looks down, noticing the leaves, HEARING THE WIND.

He listens for a moment.  Then he stands and walks out of

the tent.

OUTSIDE THE TENT

Marion watches the leaves skittering along the ground.  He

listens to the wind.

The HE LOOKS UP AT THE NIGHT SKY.  The stars are bright.

His eyes are drawn to the Big Dipper and from there to the

Little Dipper and the...

NORTH STAR.

Holding his eyes on the faint, but steady star, he

gradually reorients himself.  He looks around at the

abandoned encampment.  Then he looks into the tent and

sees Gabriel's body.  The SOFT WIND BLOWS AROUND HIM.

Marion nods in response.

EXT.  BURIAL GROUND - WOODED ENCAMPMENT - MORNING

Marion finishes burying Gabriel, putting the last

shovelfuls of dirt on the freshly turned earth.  He stands

next to the grave, looking down, and says a silent prayer.

EXT.  YORKTOWN ROAD - DAY

The AMERICAN FORCES are on the move, all heading in the

same direction.  Continentals and militiamen fill the

road.  Some on horseback, others in wagons, most on foot.

Among them, a mixed unit of Continentals and Marion's

brigade, at the head of which ride Lee, Dalton, Abner and

Rev. Oliver.

Behind them, a single horseman rides up.  It's MARION.

Without speaking, Marion rides up alongside Lee.  They

exchange nods.

Marion rides between Dalton on one side and Rev. Oliver on

the other.  They pass a sign that reads, "Yorktown.  20

miles."

EXT.  YORKTOWN OVERLOOK - DAY

The road to Yorktown skirts an OVERLOOK with a view of the

town and the harbor.  A few dozen arriving Patriots have

stopped to look out at the view.  Marion, Lee, Rev. Oliver

and Dalton join them.

The French Fleet is visible in the harbor.  The British

encampments are on a pair of peninsulas, one jutting out

from land, the other jutting toward the land from a large

island.  In a semi-circle around the landward peninsula,

the beginnings of the Patriot encirclement are visible.

It's a grand and impressive sight.

Marion and the others turn their horses and head down the

road toward the American lines.

EXT.  YORKTOWN ENCAMPMENT - DAY

AN INTERMITTENT EXCHANGE OF CANNON FIRE.  Not a battle,

but pre-battle pot shots.  Behind the American

embattlements, hundreds of American and French soldiers

drill, make camp and build secondary fortifications.

MARION, stands behind a barricade, trying to get a view of

the British defenses.  A RUNNER, a boy about fifteen,

dashes up to Marion.

Marion reaches into his pocket and pulls out a single

WALNUT which he hands to the boy.

The boy looks at the walnut and then looks at Marion as if

he's joking or crazy.  He's neither.  The boy shrugs and

runs off with the walnut.

EXT.  WASHINGTON'S HEADQUARTERS - YORKTOWN

Staff officers.  Flags.  Tents.  French and American

officers look over maps and sort out dispatches.

Messengers, runners and dispatch riders come and go

hurriedly.

The flap of the central HQ tent opens and GEORGE

WASHINGTON steps out, followed by a pair of AIDES.

Washington is tall and powerfully-built, an imposing man,

worthy of respect.

He looks around and sees the awe-struck, slightly confused

messenger boy, waiting nearby.

Washington, holding the walnut in his hand, motions him

over.

Washington scribbles something on a piece of paper and

hands it to the boy.

The boy runs off.  Washington smiles.

EXT.  PATRIOT ENCAMPMENT - DAY

CAMERA FOLLOWS Marion walking through the chaos of the

encampment.  He walks to the cluster of tents around

Washington's HQ.  He nods to the officer in charge.

Washington, leaning over the maps on his campaign table,

hears the voice and turns around.  The officers nearby

stop and watch, curious.

MARION AND WASHINGTON

Step up to one another, looking each other in the eye.

To the astonishment of Washington's officers, Marion

reaches up and lifts off Washington's wig, looking at his

hair underneath.  Marion shakes his head.

Washington holds out a small bag to Marion who reaches in

and pulls out a walnut.

Washington turns to his staff officers.

Washington and Marion walk off with Washington's officers

and aides.As Washington and Marion walk, they both CRUSH

THE WALNUTS SHELLS BETWEEN THEIR THUMBS AND FOREFINGERS, a

prodigious display of strength that both men take for

granted.  They eat walnuts as they walk.

EXT.  YORKTOWN HILLTOP - DAY

Washington's officers who include HARRY LEE, COLONEL

ALEXANDER HAMILTON, LAFAYETTE, GENERAL PINKNEY, and

various other aides and junior officers reach the crest of

the hill and wait for Washington and Marion who trail a

bit behind them, talking privately, eating walnuts as they

go.

While they wait, the officers look out at the view, seeing

the PUFFS OF SMOKE OF INTERMITTENT CANNON FIRE.

WASHINGTON AND MARION

Finish the walnuts.  They stop for a moment to catch their

breath.

They look out at the vista, knowing that they're looking

at the sons of thousands and thousands of other men.

They walk on, joining the others on the crest of the hill.

The officers are looking out, some with spyglasses, at

the British emplacements.

Washington nods and turns to Marion.

Washington sighs.

That hits Washington's officers hard.

Marion speaks up.

They all turn to Marion, most of them looking at him as if

he's insane.

Marion pulls Cornwallis' journal out of his haversack and

leafs through it.

Marion closes the journal.

Washington nods, considering it.

EXT.  CORNWALLIS' HEADQUARTERS - YORKTOWN - EVENING

Under fire.  Cornwallis and his staff.  Major Halbert

strides in and gives Cornwallis a dispatch.

Cornwallis takes the dispatch and reads it.  It staggers

him.  He sits down.

Cornwallis fumes.  His jaw sets with anger.  He slowly

crumples the dispatch and speaks with quiet fury.

EXT.  YORKTOWN - PRE-DAWN

Marion stands at the American battlements, looking out at

the British defensive works.  Above him, stars are

visible, but they're fading in the light of the pre-dawn

glow from the horizon.

Marion scans the disappearing stars, searching out the

NORTH STAR, but in the increasingly harsh light of this

day, he can't find it.  He turns his eyes back to the

battlefield.

EXT.  YORKTOWN BATTLEFIELD - DAY

The sun has risen but a heavy ground fog limits visibility

to a few dozen yards.  Men move like ghosts.

THE CAMERA finds waiting squadrons of men but in the mist.

There is no overview, just separate detachments:

An orderly regiment of CONTINENTAL CAVALRY, mounted,

waiting, steadying their horses.

Two long lines of CONTINENTAL INFANTRY RESERVES...

An American Command, including Washington, LaFayette and

two dozen staff officers, attended by riders and

runners...

And, finally, MARION AND HIS MEN, who stand in the middle

of a long line of Patriot militia in the center of a long,

valley-line depression.

They stand silently, unable to see anything other than

each other and the gently slope of the dew-covered grass

in front of them.

They're all grim.  They know what's coming.

Then, the SOUND OF A SINGLE DRUM, heard but unseen, coming

from over the slope...

Then, MORE DRUMS, more and more, A COMPETITION OF DRUM

BEATS...

Marion's men listen, turning their heads, trying to

imagine what is happening on the other side of the rise in

front of them.

MARION MOTIONS FOR HIS OFFICERS, Dalton, Scott, Rev.

Oliver and several other Patriot militia officers from

other units.  They quickly gather around.

They listen closely.

They gather around closer.

EXT.  BRITISH LINES - DAY

Cornwallis, surrounded by his staff officers, including

Tarleton, stands on a low hill, trying, with the aid of a

spyglass to catch the first view of the battlefield as the

morning mist begins to burn off.

Through the fog, he just makes out the American lines.  He

turns to Tarleton who also peers through a spyglass.

Cornwallis and Tarleton exchange a pleased look.

EXT.  LOW MEADOW - YORKTOWN - MORNING

Marion and his men wait.

A STRANGE SOUND.  Soft, muted.  The men turn their heads,

listening, their eyes shifting.

They hear the SOUND OF THOUSANDS OF BOOTS ON WET GRASS,

advancing...

THE CAMERA WATCHES THE FACES OF MARION AND HIS MEN as they

listen to an unseen army approaching.

ON MARION'S FACE we see him hearing every sound and we see

FLASH CUTS of what he knows he's hearing:

The BOOTS OF THE UNSEEN SOLDIERS...

Shouldered muskets CLICKING against pack buckles...

SILENCE at a stop...

MORE DRUMS...

The men around Marion wait.

THEN, THEY SEE IT...

A MASSIVE WALL OF RED appears over the rise in front of

them...

Thousands of Redcoats, in perfect formation, marching in

lockstep, straight for them.

Marion sees the fear on his men's faces, but none of them

move...

The BRITISH DRUMS GROW LOUDER AND LOUDER... it's almost

enough to drive a man to flight... almost.

The CAMERA explores the faces of Marion's men, faces that

we know, Rev. Oliver, Scott, Abner, Marion.  All are

frightened but all are motionless.

Closer and closer, the British line approaches...

The American's don't move...

Then, the BRITISH LINE STOPS...

At a flurry of commands, the Redcoats ready their muskets,

then aim...

Still, Marion and the Americans don't move...

DEAD SILENCE...

Then, a single, thin voice calls out from the British

lines...

IN A THUNDEROUS, MASSIVE VOLLEY, three thousand British

muskets fire simultaneously... just as the entire line of

AMERICAN MILITIAMEN DIVE TO THE GROUND...

Many Americans are saved by the move but many, many others

are torn apart by the British musketballs...

THE AMOUNT OF SMOKE IS INCREDIBLE... it obscures

everything.  Each musket spits out a billow of think white

smoke a dozen feet in front of it and three thousand of

them just fired.  The massive, opaque white cloud quickly

spreads over the entire battlefield.

The astonished Redcoats instantly reload...

And watch as the Americans rise in DISORDERLY PANIC and

FLEE...

Some Redcoats laugh...

ON A RISE BEHIND THE BATTLEFIELD, CORNWALLIS, watches

through his spyglass, trying to get a sense of what's

happening before the spreading cloud of musket smoke

obscures everything.

He barks to his SIGNALMAN...

The Signalman raises his semaphore flags and snaps the

message.

MARION AND HIS MEN are caught in the middle of the chaotic

retreat...

THE BRITISH LINE advances at a quickstep, bayonets

fixed...

From behind them, THE GREEN DRAGOONS appear, at a full

gallop, Tarleton at their head...

THE BATTLEFIELD

It's an astonishing sight... total madness... hell... a

painting by Hieronymous Bosch...

The mass of the British infantry charges after the fleeing

Patriot militiamen...

The Redcoat infantry grows disorderly as it runs...

TARLETON AND THE BRITISH CAVALRY THUNDERS to the head of

the Redcoats, closing in on the fleeing Patriots.  The

cavalry swords are drawn and raised for a slaughter...

THEN SUDDENLY

Stepping into view from behind a low, grass covered rise,

a SOLID LINE OF BLUE APPEARS, rock solid...

It open up, allowing the fleeing Patriots to pass through

it like water...

then it closes again, becoming a solid blue wall...

MARION, HIS MEN AND THE ENTIRE MASS OF FLEEING MILITIA

STOPS DEAD, turns and joins the blue American line...

A flurry of orders, then the BLUE WALL ERUPTS WITH A

VOLLEY of musket fire that stops the disorderly British

advance in its tracks...

Hundreds of Redcoats fall instantly...

Hundreds of Green Dragoons and their horses fall with

them...

The effect of the volley is devastating...'

The American timing is perfect...

Again, the amount of SMOKE is astonishing... visibility

drops to less than twenty feet in most places...

Drifting smoke opens up glimpses of the battle here and

there but it is primarily a battle of sound...

Men simply follow the men in front of them...

The Blue Continentals advance in an orderly manner from

both flanks onto the Redcoats, trapping them...

The Redcoats try to flee...

Fighting small, gathered holding actions...

MARION FIRES one of his pistols...

Draws his sword...

Slashes downward... killing one Redcoat after another...

No remorse, no hesitation, no pity...

A relentless, simple battle...

Slashing through the Redcoat infantry...

His sword sinks into the stock of an upraised British

musket and is pulled from his hands...

Marion quickly kills the Redcoat with his pistol...

THEN, THROUGH THE SMOKE, MARION CATCHES A GLIMPSE OF

TARLETON...

Marion freezes... his eyes locked on Tarleton who is

fighting a pitched battle, making his way toward the

perimeter of the field, trying to escape back to the

British lines...

Seeing nothing but Tarleton, Marion hurriedly tears open

his weapons pouch and pulls out one of the bullets made

from Thomas' lead soldiers...

As he loads the pistol, his eyes still trained on

Tarleton, Dalton runs up in the chaos...

Marion finishes reloading... distracted he turns to Dalton

for an instant...

Marion takes a quick glance at the Continental line,

seeing...

Scott, Rev. Oliver, Abner and a dozen more of his men, in

the middle of a confused battle, with a larger mass of

Redcoats who are advancing through the broken Continental

line...

MARION IS TORN...

He looks to Tarleton, seeing him distracted, vulnerable

but too distant a target for the pistol...

Then Marion looks to Rev. Oliver and the others... Dalton

can't wait... he runs off...

Marion wavers...

Then he takes a last look at Tarleton and heads off to

help the faltering Patriots...

TARLETON sees the movement of Marion and his men and sees

Marion himself, his back exposed...

AT THE PATRIOT LINE...

Marion, Dalton and two dozen other militia cavalrymen

arrive at the same time, beating back the Redcoats...

As blue-uniformed Continentals reform the line, FIRING AT

THE FALTERING REDCOATS...

TARLETON sees Marion and fights his way toward him...

Marion is oblivious, concentrating on holding the American

line...

Tarleton mounts a terrified, riderless horses, draws his

sword and gallops back toward the British lines, on a path

that takes him directly past Marion...

Tarleton gets closer... raises his sword... slashes...

Marion catches the flash of the blade out of the corner of

his eye...

Diverts the blow, knocking Tarleton from the mount...

Tarleton hits the ground... Marion draws his pistol, about

to fire at Tarleton...

Tarleton KICKS OUT, knocking the pistol from Marion's

hand...

Tarleton GRABS HIS SWORD, SLASHES AT MARION who dodges the

blow...

Tarleton advances... Marion scrambles back, then rises...

Marion grabs a BROKEN CAVALRY LANCE and FENDS OFF REPEATED

BLOWS from Tarleton's SWORD...

Then Marion sees his pistol, loaded with a bullet from

Thomas' lead soldiers, lying on the ground...

Marion makes his way toward the weapon... still BLOCKING

BLOWS from Tarleton's sword...

Marion focuses on the pistol... leaving himself exposed...

Tarleton sees the OPENING... MOVES ON MARION... TARLETON

RAISES HIS SWORD, about to deliver the killing blow...

Marion dives... GRABS HIS PISTOL... FIRES... KILLING

TARLETON WITH A SHOT TO THE CHEST...

Marion, stunned, exhausted and surprised to be alive,

watches Tarleton fall...

Marion stands over Tarleton's body and gives himself a

moment of bitter triumph, then he turns back to the battle

at hand...

Marion picks up Tarleton's sword and runs to the AMERICAN

LINE which stiffens as Dalton and Rev. Oliver are joined

by Marion and a dozen other Patriots...

The blue-uniformed Continentals reform their line...

Marion looks back toward Tarleton but finds that his body,

along with the place and the moment of his death, has

disappeared into the smoke of the battle...

Marion and his men fight on... then, Redcoats start

fleeing the field...

First one Redcoat at a time... then more and more...

EXT.  YORKTOWN - DAWN

The next day.  Silence.  The battlefield, as far as the

eye can see, is covered with the debris of war, dead men

and scattered weapons.

The British have retreated back behind their defenses but

have left many of their men on the field.

The Patriots, regulars and militia, wait behind their

barricades.

Then, a single figure appears on one of the British

parapets.  A DRUMMER BOY, no more than ten-years-old.

Behind him, a single British officer.

They boy begins to beat the drum.  The officer raises a

white flag.

In the American lines, the men see the flag.  Some call

out, some cheer, some laugh, most, among them MARION,

simply take a deep breath.  It's finally over.

EXT.  YORKTOWN FIELD - DAY

A massive ceremony, carefully orchestrated, laid out on

the cleaned up battlefield.

Thousands of men, everyone in his place, as if well-

directed actors in a grand theatrical performance.

The French and American armies, fifteen thousand men

between them, stand in perfect formation on either side of

the field, forming an avenue for the British army which

marches out of it's fortification.

At the head of the avenue, WASHINGTON AND HIS STAFF stand

waiting.

A musical band of Continentals, thirty men strong, loudly

plays a tune, "The World Turned Upside Down," a jaunty

British air with a melancholy undercurrent.

CORNWALLIS marches with his officers, eyes straight ahead,

covering his agony as best he can.

As he walks along the avenue he passes the remnants of the

South Carolina militia.

MARION, standing with Dalton, Rev. Oliver, Abner, Scott

and the rest of his surviving men sees Cornwallis pass...

CORNWALLIS glances over, noting what unit they are by a

tattered battle standard that flies over them.  It's only

a glance and he DOESN'T PICK OUT MARION, who is just one

man among the many...

AT THE HEAD OF THE AVENUE

Cornwallis reaches Washington.  They exchange unheard

formal greetings.

Cornwallis, DRAWS HIS SWORD AND HANDS IT TO WASHINGTON...

FIFTEEN THOUSAND MEN, American and French, RAISE THEIR

VOICES in a CHEER OF ASTONISHING VOLUME...

With every other pair of eyes directed toward the ceremony

between Washington and Cornwallis, MARION quietly and

unnoticed, slips out the back of the formation and walks

away.

EXT.  YORKTOWN - DAY

The surrender ceremony continues.  Marion, on the fringe

of the field, finishes saddling his horses and prepares to

leave.  LEE walks out of the crowd and joins him.  They

lock eyes for a moment, then Marion mounts up.

Marion reaches down.  They shake hands.

As Marion starts to ride off, he reins back and stops,

speaking back to Lee over his shoulder.

Marion smiles.

Lee nods.  Marion rides off.

EXT.  CHERAW FALLS - DAY

Marion's children and Charlotte sit by the river.  Samuel

sits on the lookout ledge with his musket.  Suddenly he

stands, looking out, seeing something.

Charlotte and the others notice.  They're worried.  Then

they see Samuel throw down his musket and tear down the

path, running as fast as he can, tumbling, then regaining

his feet...

Charlotte and the others know who's coming...

The children take off running after Samuel...

Racing toward the road...

Charlotte hurries after them...

AND THEN THEY SEE HIM...

MARION, riding at a full gallop...

The children cry out with tears of joy...

MARION see Susan...

He gallops toward her...

LEANS OVER...

Without slowing, he SWOOPS HER UP into the saddle...

She wraps herself around him...

He reins back, stops and dismounts, just as the other

children reach him...

They throw themselves into his arms... embracing him...

Charlotte hurries up behind them...

She and Marion lock eyes and he is enveloped by the hugs

of his children.

EXT.  POND BLUFF - EVENING

Summer.  The apple tree at the top of the hill is covered

with apples.

Marion's house is partially rebuilt and habitable.  The

workshop is already completed.

MARION'S CHILDREN, Nathan, Samuel, Margaret and William,

play in the tall grass in front of the house with the two

GREAT DANES.

CHARLOTTE sits on the front porch, NURSING AN INFANT.

MARION walks out of his workshop, trailed by Susan.  He

carries a just-completed rocking chair.

The chair is a work of art, thin and light, a spider-web

of perfectly turned wood, no nails, no glue.

He steps onto the porch next to Charlotte and places the

rocking chair next to her.

He smiles and make a minute adjustment in the chair's

position.  Then he sits down, settles back and begins

rocking.  Not a creak.

Marion and Charlotte watch Susan run out of the yard,

calling as she joins the other children.

As the CAMERA CRANES UP, Marion and Charlotte disappear

beneath the overhang of the porch roof.  Suddenly, the

SOUND OF A CRASH.

The CAMERA CONTINUES TO CRANE UP as Marion walks off the

porch, crosses the yard and enters his workshop.  A moment

later, the SOUND OF MARION'S LATHE RISES.
