fire. A bland CIA Operative, flanked by Special Forces Men,

vehicle.

The Driver shoves the bespectacled man in front of the CIA

Man.

Dr. Pavel nods, nervous. CIA Man hands the Driver a

briefcase.

Pavel.

The Driver nods. CIA Man turns to his Special Forces Men.

CIA Man grabs Hooded Man 1.

Hooded Man 1 says nothing. CIA Man pulls out a handgun.

CIA Man opens the cargo door. Special Forces hang Hooded Man

1 out into the howling wind - CIA Man shouts above the wind.

Nothing. CIA Man fires out the open door and the Special

Forces yank Hooded Man 1 back in, clubbing him quiet.

The Soldiers grab Hooded Man 2, hang him out the door.

The prisoner says nothing. CIA Man presses the gun to the

man's hood - he cocks the gun...nothing.

CIA Man turns to the Third Prisoner. Shuts the cargo door.

CIA Man, wary, approaches the Third Prisoner - pulls off his

hood, revealing a dark mask with a breathing apparatus. The

eyes behind it are cold. Still. This is Bane.

CIA Man laughs for the Special Forces' benefit. A heavy bass

tone is rising. The Sergeant looks out the window.

Dr. Pavel, strapped in, pushes against the seat in front of

him - the plane vibrates, trying to tear itself apart.

by Dr. Pavel.

The men attach explosives to the tail, then jump away,

swinging out as the tail explodes.

INT. MAIN CABIN, COMMUTER PLANE - CONTINUOUS

An explosion takes off the rear door of the cabin - the

Armed Men drop through the smoke on cables.

A body bag is lowered into the cabin. Bane lies it on the

seat backs next to Dr. Pavel and unzips it to reveal a body

the same age and build as Dr. Pavel.

Bane rips Dr. Pavel's sleeve - pulls out a length of

surgical tubing - pushes a needle into Dr. Pavel's arm -

runs the tube to the body's arm... Dr. Pavel watches,

horrified, as Bane starts compressions on the body's chest,

drawing Dr. Pavel's blood across the tube and into the

body...

An Armed Man pulls Hooded Man 1 up through the cabin and

out. Bane stops Hooded Man 2.

The man nods, unhooks himself, takes Bane's arm.

Hooded Man 2 hands Bane his line. Bane clips it around Dr.

Pavel, takes out a knife and cuts Dr. Pavel's seat belt. Dr.

Pavel panics, flails. Bane takes his arms. Gentle.

Bane slides Dr. Pavel out of his seat. They hang in the

vertical, windblown cabin. Bane takes out a detonator.

Bane presses the detonator - the cabin drops from around

them, revealing the terrifying drop to the peaks below. Dr.

Pavel screams as they are hoisted up towards the transport,

and we -

addresses the wealthy and powerful of Gotham.

Enthusiastic applause as the Mayor wraps up.

High above, on a darkened balcony, a lone figure. Watching.

Down below at the bar, Commissioner Gordon examines some

sheets of densely written paper. A Congressman muscles in.

Gordon shakes his head. Gordon's Deputy Commissioner, Foley,

cuts in.

The Congressman watches a tray of canapes breeze past, then

grabs the ass of the maid carrying them. She freezes.

The Congressman grabs two. The Maid moves off. The

Congressman glances down at Gordon's papers.

Applause. Gordon approaches the mike. Looks down at his long

speech. Thinks.

Gordon's son with a handgun.

INT. KITCHENS, WAYNE MANOR - MOMENTS LATER

Our Maid dives into the bustle of Wayne Manor below stairs -

Caterers and Maids, Wait Staff. She overhears another Maid.

The other Maids signal her to be quiet. All the chatter has

died. Alfred has entered the kitchen.

Alfred places a glass of water on a tray next to a covered

plate. Picks up the tray, looks around the chaotic kitchen.

Alfred looks at the Maid. Hands her a key and the tray.

The Maid nods. Takes the tray.

INT. DRAWING ROOM, EAST WING, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS

Close on the dinner tray. We hear a labored step approach.

Bruce Wayne appears, leaning on a cane. Gaunt. Grey temples.

He lifts the lid of his dinner, then freezes, hearing

something. He slowly limps into the next room...

INT. SITTING ROOM, EAST WING, WAYNE MANOR, CONTINUOUS

The Maid looks at framed photographs of Rachel, Thomas and

Martha Wayne. Some are half-burned. She notices an archery

target, arrows stuck in it. She reaches out. WHAM! An arrow

sticks into the target - the Maid spins around, flustered.

Wayne, at the other end of the long room, lowers a composite

bow. Picks up his cane.

Wayne nods, gently. Limps towards her.

She trails off, embarrassed. Coy. She seems very young.

Wayne approaches slowly. He nods at her pearl necklace.

He reaches out with his cane to press open a panel on the

bureau, revealing a safe door...

...which swings open with an awkward creak.

The Maid suddenly seems more confident. Older.

She smiles at him. Moves towards him.

She kicks his cane from under him, smashes him down.

The Maid vaults onto the bureau and up to a high window.

She flips backwards through the window. Wayne smiles, then

rocks forward on his good leg and rises with athletic grace.

He looks at the safe, notices something. Powder...

EXT. DRIVE, WAYNE MANOR - CONTINUOUS

Moving toward the line of town cars, the Maid pulls off her

white apron, cuffs and collar, leaving a black dress and

pearls. A Valet hurries to open a car door for her - she

slips into a town car...beside the Congressman.

The Congressman, a little tipsy, looks at her hungrily.

INT. EAST WING, WAYNE MANOR - LATER

Alfred enters, to find Wayne kneeling at the safe.

EXT. ROOFTOP, MAJOR CRIMES UNIT - CONTINUOUS

A young Cop is standing there. This is Blake.

Gordon smiles at this. Blake looks at his stack of files.

Blake shifts uneasily. Then looks at Gordon.

Gordon turns to look at the broken searchlight. He brushes

his fingers across its rusted shell.

Gordon walks past Blake, heading for the stairs.

INT. EAST WING, WAYNE MANOR - MORNING

Alfred takes his tray into the bedroom. The bed is empty.

Alfred's voice echoes through the vast mansion. No reply.

INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - CONTINUOUS

Alfred descends into the caverns beneath Wayne Manor.

INT. BATCAVE - CONTINUOUS

Alfred walks through the arches as the stone floor starts to

lower, becoming a ramp. At the bottom, Alfred is level with

a series of dark slate obelisks - a bridge over the water to

where Wayne sits at a computer atop a massive slate cube.

Wayne pulls up a mug shot - a fat, male armed-robbery

suspect.

Wayne hits a key. A photograph of the Maid appears.

Newspaper headlines appear -

THE CAT STRIKES AGAIN, POLICE SUSPECT 'CAT' BURGLAR IN JEWEL

HEIST.

Wayne says nothing.

Wayne looks at Alfred. Not understanding.

INT. DIVE BAR - NIGHT

Selina Kyle, in a little black dress, walks in with a drunk

in a Hawaiian shirt. She sits him on a bar stool - walks

over to a table where a neatly dressed man, Stryver, sits.

Selina glances around. Things scattered throughout the bar.

Jumpy. Selina hands an envelope to Stryver.

Stryver slides a transparency out of the envelope. Holds it

up to the light. Four perfect fingerprint transfers.

He pockets the envelope.

Stryver signals a Thug who locks the door. Another Thug

joins them at the table. Selina smiles.

As Stryver checks the envelope again -

The Second Thug puts a gun to Selina's head.

Selina looks in his eyes. The Thug cocks his gun. She

blinks.

She reaches for her purse. The Thug stops her, reaches in

himself - pulls out a cellphone. Slides it across the table.

Stryver looks at the phone. Hits 'send'. Selina sizes up her

options. A knock on the door. Second Thug hides his gun. The

door opens - a young woman, Jen. She enters, cheerful, spots

Selina. Pulls out an envelope, looks around.

Jen leaves. Stryver checks the envelope. Satisfied.

Stryver looks at Selina's 'date' drooling into a bowl of

nuts at the bar - he looks familiar...

Across the bar, the TV on mute -

MANHUNT FOR MISSING CONGRESSMAN.

Stryver looks at Selina.

Stryver glances down at the cell phone as - SCREECH - the

Thugs look out the window at cop cars and SWAT units

descending on the bar. Stryver glances at the window and -

SMASH - Selina CRACKS his head against the table, grabs

Second Thug's gun hand, flips over the table, firing at the

other Thugs, who drop. The SWATs batter down the door.

Selina crouches, cowering, screaming.

The SWATs barrel past, chasing the remaining Thugs back

through the bar and out into the back alley. Selina smiles.

truck and into the night.

INT. DIVE BAR - CONTINUOUS

Blake enters, gun drawn. Spots the Congressman.

EXT. ALLEY BEHIND BAR - CONTINUOUS

The SWATs return fire. The Thugs lay down cover fire, then

race around a corner into a smaller passage.

A cop car pulls up, blocking the mouth of the alley - Gordon

jumps out, gun drawn.

The SWATs approach the passage, massing on both corners

tactically. The two corner SWATs exchange hand signals,

counting down... They round the corner, aiming low and high.

The passage is empty.

The SWATs cover a fire escape, but Gordon spots at once -

He races to the manhole cover - SWATs wrench off the cover,

Gordon grabs a flashlight from the nearest SWAT.

Gordon starts climbing down the ladder...

tearing through the tunnels.

EXT. ALLEY BEHIND BAR - CONTINUOUS

Blake pushes forward.

Blake backs off. Gets an idea - goes for his patrol car.

INT. SEWERS - CONTINUOUS

Thug 1 flips Gordon onto his back.

The two Thugs drag Gordon down through the maze of tunnels.

As they descend deeper they encounter work crews of muscular

men wielding large drills and jackhammers, working the walls

and ceiling of the larger tunnels. Some of the men are armed

Mercenaries, overseeing gangs of homeless street kids. They

stare as Gordon is dragged past. The Thugs drag Gordon

between two waterfalls, into -

INT. BANE'S LAIR, SEWERS - CONTINUOUS (NIGHT)

They approach a figure, turned away, crouched in the

firelight. Bare-chested, muscular, masked. Bane. A crooked

line of scar tissue runs the length of his spine...

The Thugs drop Gordon at Bane's feet.

Bane slowly turns to the Thugs.

Bane flips the Thug's chin up and to the side with a crack.

Thug 1 drops. Bane turns to Thug 2.

The Thug, terrified, pulls out Gordon's badge, wallet,

gun...and the folded papers of the speech he did not read.

Bane takes these one by one with quick glances. He stops at

the papers. Unfolds them...

As he reads, Gordon rolls off the steps, dropping into the

rushing flow of water - gunshots ring out...

Thug 2 trails off as Bane looks up from the papers...

Bane turns to the Lead Mercenary.

Lead Mercenary hands him a GPS - Bane tucks it into Thug 2's

jacket, zips it up like a mother sending her kid to school.

Bane shoots Thug 2, kicks him into the water. Turns to Lead

Mercenary.

EXT. WATER TREATMENT FACILITY - NIGHT

Blake comes out to the catchment basin. He spots something

elevator.

INT. APPLIED SCIENCES - MOMENTS LATER

Fox leads Wayne into the vast, gadget-filled space. They

pass Tumblers with different weapons configurations...

Wayne shakes his head.

light up.

Wayne touches its sleek side. Marveling.

Wayne looks wistfully at the machine. Turns away.

INT. EXAMINATION ROOM, GOTHAM GENERAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT

Wayne listens, distracted, while a Doctor examines an X-ray.

Wayne smiles. The Doctor leaves. Wayne pulls on a ski mask,

steps to the window, hops up, pulls a wire from his cane,

which he clips to his belt. He props his cane behind the

frame - jumps out. The wire unspools from the cane as -

EXT. TENTH FLOOR, GOTHAM GENERAL HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS

Wayne drops three floors...

INT. PRIVATE ROOM, GOTHAM GENERAL - CONTINUOUS

to speak with a weak, hoarse voice...

INT./EXT. LAMBORGHINI ON GOTHAM STREETS - NIGHT

Wayne pulls up in front of a row of shabby subdivided town

houses. Checks a tracking device. Jon, provocatively

dressed, leads a Yuppie Banker-type in through a front door.

INT. SELINA'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Selina sits in a small room getting ready to go out. She

picks up the pearls - hears a disturbance in the hall.

INT. STAIRWELL OUTSIDE SELINA'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

The Yuppie has Jen against the wall - he reaches back to hit

her with an expensive wristwatch-clad arm. But Selina has

grabbed his wrist with a powerful grip.

Selina twists his arm behind him in a blinding move.

She releases the Yuppie, who moves off down the stairs.

Selina turns to Jen. Who is examining a wallet.

Selina opens her hand and gives Jen the Yuppie's Rolex.

EXT. SELINA'S BUILDING, OLD TOWN, GOTHAM - LATER

Town cars dispense Gotham society in tasteful masquerade.

Wayne pulls up to the Valet. Paparazzi line the entrance.

Wayne uses his cane to get out of his Lamborghini...

Lenses swing onto Wayne, who pushes a button on his key fob

- a pulse. The cameras die. Wayne heads to the door.

INT. MUSEUM - CONTINUOUS

A lavish ball - the expressively attired dance under falling

confetti... Even Bruce Wayne is struck by the ostentation.

He spots Selina dancing with a deeply smitten Rich Twit. She

wears a small, velvet pair of cat ears. And the pearls.

Wayne turns to find Miranda Tate, amazed, a small mask her

only concession to fancy dress.

Wayne looks at Miranda. Intrigued.

Wayne watches Miranda glide away. Then turns to Selina.

Rich Twit turns, annoyed - Wayne hands him his cane. Takes

Selina by the waist. She glares at him.

It's pronounced 'Ibeetha'. You

wouldn't want these folks realizing

you're a crook not a social

climber.

You think I care what anyone in

this room thinks about me?

I doubt you care what anyone in

this room thinks about you.

Don't condescend, Mr. Wayne. You

don't know a thing about me.

Well, Selina Kyle, I know you came

here from your walk-up in Old Town

- modest place for a master jewel

thief. Which means either you're

saving for your retirement - or

you're in deep with the wrong

people.

You don't get to judge me because

you were born in the master bedroom

of Wayne Manor.

Actually, I was born in the Regency

Room.

I started off doing what I had to.

Once you've done what you had to

they'll never let you do what you

want to.

Start fresh.

There's no fresh start in today's

world. Any twelve-year-old with a

cell phone could find out what you

did. Everything we do is collated

and quantified. Everything sticks.

We are the sum of our mistakes.

Wayne glances around at the sumptuous party.

Wayne rolls her into his shoulder - reaches up to the back

of her neck, unclasps the necklace.

The pearls slide off her neck into his other hand. Selina

looks at him. Angry. Then kisses him, hard, and disappears

into the crowd. Wayne's cane reappears.

Wayne gives him a withering glare.

Wayne dials his phone.

Up front, Alfred listens. Concerned.

INT. BATCAVE - DAY

Wayne pushes a button on a hi-tech carbon fiber brace

strapped to his good knee - the brace tones. As Wayne starts

moving his knee, bending, stretching, Alfred puts down a

Thermos.

Wayne swaps the brace to his bad knee. Puts his weight on it

- the knee bends, kicks. He sits again. Cautious.

Wayne gingerly pushes a button - the brace starts to shrink

tight to his leg, digging in. Wayne grits his teeth.

Wayne shouts as the brace clicks home. He gets to his feet.

Wayne executes a perfect roundhouse, knocking out a brick.

Alfred picks up the brick. Considers it. Uneasy. He follows

Wayne across the bridge to the cube.

Wayne takes this in. Shocked.

The Batsuit emerges from the cube.

Wayne looks at Alfred. Then turns to examine the Batsuit.

INT. STOCK EXCHANGE - EVENING

A frenzy of trading on the packed floor...

Two Traders sit on a shoeshine stand in the lobby.

there negotiating with a Trader.

Trader 3 spots bad news on a screen.

He thrusts Food Guy a tip and grabs the bag, distracted...

At the rear secure entrance: a Motorcycle Courier enters,

wearing his helmet - a Female Security Guard gets in his

face.

In the rest room: a Janitor mops the floor, shifting out of

the way of two Traders who rush in to pee.

At the shoeshine stand, Trader 1 waves a bill down at the

man shining his shoes without a glance. Shoeshine Man takes

the bill, then, as the Traders step off, he reaches into a

gym bag and checks an automatic weapon. He clicks the slide

home, then hoists the gym bag and heads for the trading

floor.

At the secure entrance: the Courier pulls off his helmet.

The Female Security Guard's eyes go wide.

In the rest room: the Janitor reaches into his bucket and

pulls out a machine pistol in a Ziploc bag.

Near the front entrance: Food Guy pulls an automatic pistol

- clubs Trader 3 with it, pastrami flying. Shoeshine Man

moves onto the floor, pulls out his weapon.

Under the Courier's helmet - a mask. Bane. He grabs the

Female Security Guard and throws her into her colleagues,

lashing out in four directions with rapidfire lethality.

Shoeshine Man fires into the large trading screens. The

floor erupts into a different frenzy - traders hit the deck,

screaming. Bane moves onto the floor...

He dries up as Bane stops. Turns to him...

Bane grabs Trader 1 by the throat and drags him across the

floor to an online automated trades terminal... He puts the

man's thumb onto the print reader - the screen lights up.

Trader 1, terrified, types in his password. Outside, sirens.

Shoeshine man pulls out a USB drive with an antenna - plugs

it into the computer - figures race across the screen...

EXT. STOCK EXCHANGE - CONTINUOUS

Police vehicles screech into the narrow street -

And, out of the silence, a dark shape roars past -

EXT. HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

Food Guy drives the rear bike. He looks back - sees

streetlights explode behind him - darkness catching him up.

INT. INNER OFFICE, DAGGETT'S PENTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Moving in on a shadow, crouched in front of Daggett's safe,

working the dial... The shadow slides up a pair of goggles

onto the top of its head creating the silhouette of cat

ears. It is Catwoman. She turns to the TV, watching the

pursuit.

Catwoman opens the safe. Nothing inside. She frowns.

EXT. GOTHAM STREETS - CONTINUOUS

Bane slips between two cruisers who tear after the Batman.

He jumps up onto a concrete barrier, then down to the mouth

of an outflow pipe. He glances at the entire Gotham Police

Department descending on one man. Disappears into the pipe.

EXT. GOTHAM STREETS - CONTINUOUS

Shoeshine Man glances into his pack - the program beeps,

finished. He looks back to see the Bat-Pod racing at him,

ducks as it comes alongside...riderless. Shoeshine Man looks

up, confused. WHUMP! His hostage is ripped off the bike by a

low-flying dark shape.

Shoeshine Man lays down the bike in a shower of sparks,

rolls off dazed. Batman grabs him.

Shoeshine Man stares. Unafraid. Batman rips the computer

from his pack. The screen reads:

Blinding light and noise as police choppers descend - sirens

everywhere. Batman grabs the USB drive from the laptop. He

jumps on the Bat-Pod - pauses, taking in the sight of

thousands of police, cars, choppers, dogs, closing in.

Batman looks at the line of stopped traffic. An empty car

transporter is below the on-ramp... Batman fires the cannons

at the transporter, the near ramp crashes down, and Batman

The Bat-Pod executes a ninety-degree turn, flipping over as

it goes, then guns into the darkness of a large blind alley.

Cruisers and choppers block the mouth of the alley. Blake

arrives last, his cruiser sealing the bottleneck. Foley

swaggers out.

Foley reaches for a loudhailer. VARRROOOOM!! A noise from

the alley that none of the cops have heard before...

Spotlights smash on and a massive dark cyclone roars out of

the alley, spinning the choppers sideways, dual rotor

downdraft forcing all the cops to the ground.

The Bat, now black, thunders up and over the entire Gotham

PD. Blake slides up to Foley. Dry.

Foley looks at Blake. Thrusts the loudhailer at him.

office.

INT. INNER OFFICE, DAGGETT'S PENTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Daggett comes through the door, calling back.

Catwoman grabs him, throws him across the room. His back

slams against the wall - he draws a gun, but - WHACK! -

Catwoman pins his wrist to the wall at shoulder height using

the high heel of her boot. He whimpers as she leans in.

She plucks the gun from his trembling hand.

Click - Stryver has a gun to her head.

Stryver looks appreciatively at Catwoman as she lowers her

leg...

Catwoman digs her stiletto into his calf, hard. He screams.

Catwoman spins, disarms Stryver, grabs Daggett.

The Bodyguard bursts in, gun drawn. Catwoman, holding

heel. The glass shatters. She pulls Daggett through the

Catwoman leans back from Daggett, taking this in... Shapes

drop onto the rooftop. Emerge from fire exits. They're not

Daggett's bodyguards, these are Bane's men... Catwoman holds

Daggett by the throat, threatening him.

They continue to approach. One of them screws a silencer

onto his gun.

All eyes search for the source of the voice. Catwoman spots

it - a dark shape, crouched on the roof above: Batman.

As the Mercenary with the silencer looks up, Catwoman leaps

forward, grabs his gun. Batman drops into the middle of the

fray, fighting back Mercenaries at Catwoman's back - she

fires at one, clipping him, he drops. She spins aiming at

another's head - Batman yanks her arm down, forcing her to

miss the Mercenary. Batman takes him out with a kick.

As more mercenaries come out onto the roof, Batman runs for

the far edge.

Catwoman follows, confused, as Batman leaps off the roof.

She gets to the edge, pauses to look down into the alley -

sees the black angular roof of the Bat, cockpit open.

Shots impact around her - she leaps, landing hard, but

gracefully on the back of the vehicle, slides into the

cockpit. As the engines thunder into life, and the canopy

hisses shut, taking bullets from above.

Catwoman flinches as the Bat thunders into the sky,

downdraft forcing the Mercenaries down onto the roof, all

but one, who walks slowly across the roof, strong against

the wind...Bane. He watches the Bat roar off into the night.

EXT. ROOFTOP, SKYSCRAPER, GOTHAM - MOMENTS LATER

The Bat lands - the canopy opens. Catwoman jumps out.

Alfred takes the cowl from him, then the cape, as they walk.

Batman lashes out at Bane - Bane counters - they separate.

Batman hurls himself at Bane, throwing him into the

painful...the skull drifts into his sight. Bane. Squatting

at Wayne's bedside, muscled shoulders curving into his mask.

Wayne exhales. Eyes losing focus from sheer pain.

Wayne's eyes dart about: filthy stone walls, distant

sunlight from above, iron bars: an underground prison.

Wayne lies, weak, feverish. A Prisoner drips water onto his

parched lips. An elderly Blind Prisoner squatting by the

wall in the next cell rasps something in an ancient tongue.

The Prisoner puts bread to Wayne's lips.

A chant gets Wayne's attention. He rolls his head painfully

to watch a Tattooed Prisoner hand a thick rope to a Strong

Man, who ties it around his chest, watched by other

Prisoners.

Strong Man starts scaling the wall. The Prisoners' chant

grows stronger as he climbs towards the light.

Above: Strong Man stops, perched on a ledge, a twelve-foot

leap from the rest of the climb... The chanting peaks as

Strong Man leaps...misses...falls. The rope catches - he

swings into the rock face. Prisoners fall silent as Strong

Man is lowered, broken, bloody, to the prison floor.

catches the Driver in the back and he goes down... Blake,

gasping, kneels beside the Driver.

The man dies. Blake looks down at his gun. Disgusted. Tosses

gather, the Prisoner at their head. Wayne looks up at the

light, hundreds of feet above. Starts to climb. Prisoners

get excited as Wayne RISES - money starts exchanging hands.

Reaching the precipice, he checks his rope, looks up at the

next handhold, far away. He takes a breath, then LEAPS.

His fingers brush the ledge. Wayne DROPS a hundred feet -

the rope catches, SLAMMING him into the rock face. The

Prisoners disperse, losing interest as the Tattooed Prisoner

lowers Wayne on the rope. The Blind Prisoner turns away.

INSERT CUT: the Protector fights off prisoners as the Child,

older now, moves to the climbing wall

INSERT CUT: the Child makes the climb...pauses, looking down

- making eye-contact with the Protector, who fights off

Prisoners... They swarm over the Protector, knives drawn.

INSERT CUT: the Child leaps across the abyss, grabbing a

handhold on the ledge and swinging up...

Wayne's eyes close in despair.

Captain Jones reels at this news.

Captain Jones throws Blake a look. Addresses Fox.

Bane places his hand over Jones's nose and mouth.

Bane looks up, disinterested. Jones is dead.

INT. STONE CELL, UNDERGROUND PRISON - DAY

Wayne stares at the TV: the Special Forces bodies hang in

the cables of Gotham Bridge. Wayne throws a stone into the

Prisoner listens. He speaks in an ancient tongue.

Wayne throws punches...focused.

INT. UNDERGROUND PRISON - DAY

Wayne takes the rope at the foot of the climb. Prisoners

look up, but none bother to gather round. Wayne starts

climbing, determined.

He FIGHTS the rock face...breathing hard. Grabs at a rock -

it comes away in his hand. He DROPS - SMASHES into the rock

face. The Blind Prisoner shakes his head.

A Skinny Prisoner playing cards with the Prisoner looks up

at Wayne, hanging upside down.

The Prisoner glances up at Wayne, disdainful.

As Wayne drifts into unconsciousness we -

INSERT CUT: Young Bruce lies at the bottom of the well,

looking up at his father, lowering down to rescue him.

Wayne gets up onto his elbow. Looks at the Blind Prisoner.

Wayne considers this.

INT. CAVE PRISON - MORNING

Wayne puts some scraps of bread into a rough coat which he

folds into a makeshift shoulder pack.

Prisoners nearby laugh. Wayne moves to the cliff face. The

Prisoner follows, intrigued by Wayne's new demeanor. The

Tattooed Prisoner offers him the rope. Wayne refuses. Starts

to climb. Prisoners gather around as word spreads. Wayne

makes his way cautiously up the treacherous rock face. Down

below the Prisoners start a low chant.

As Wayne hoists himself up onto the precipice something

EXPLODES from the cliff face. Wayne flinches - BATS... They

circle up to the opening above...

Wayne closes his eyes. The chant RISES. Wayne takes a

breath...opens his eyes...looks down at the drop...up

again...then he jumps.

Time skips a beat as the Prisoners stop breathing.

And Wayne GRABS the ledge above.

The Prisoners go WILD as Wayne hoists himself up onto the

ledge. The Blind Prisoner nods. Wayne climbs to FREEDOM.

EXT. CAVE PRISON, NEAR A FORTRESS - CONTINUOUS

Wayne climbs out of the hole and into formidable desolation.

He shoulders his pack - spots a large coil of rope attached

to the wall. He pushes it into the hole then walks away...

INT. BASEMENT, ABANDONED STOCK EXCHANGE - DAY

A mass of huddled Gothamites. Professionals (traders,

industrialists). In a corner, Fox. Mercenaries come down

Fox watches him dragged upstairs...

INT. ABANDONED STOCK EXCHANGE - MOMENTS LATER

A kangaroo court. Stryver is dragged before a jeering crowd.

'Death'.

Mercenaries pull Stryver from the dock...

EXT. GOTHAM RIVER - DAY

Stryver, with other wealthy Gothamites, is led down to the

INT. EMPTY OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

Gordon stands over a map of the city. A handful of Cops sit

Gordon heads for the door.

EXT. FOLEY'S BROWNSTONE - DAY

Gordon hurries up the steps to a brownstone. Stabs the bell.

Gordon, furious, addresses the hallway behind her.

Foley appears at the end of the corridor. Ashamed.

Gordon turns to see Miranda, Blake behind her. Blake shrugs.

Gordon looks at Blake. Then Miranda. Nods.

EXT. GOTHAM STREET - DAY

A Kid sprints down the deserted street, chased by two

Gangbangers. The Kid slips in the snow - the men are on him.

They grab the Kid's backpack, the Gangbanger pulls out an

apple, moves to hit the Kid when - SMACK! - his hand is

grabbed, and the apple flies into the air as his arm cracks.

Selina catches the apple.

Gangbanger 2 lunges with a knife - she spins him, making him

stab himself in the backside. The Gangbangers run off,

howling. The Kid eyes her, wary.

Selina looks at the red apple. Takes one perfect bite.

She tosses him the apple. He takes it and runs.

Selina recognizes the voice. Turns to find Wayne - strong,

but weathered. Beard, work clothes.

Wayne pulls a USB drive out of his pocket.

She looks at him. Takes the drive, staring at it.

EXT. GOTHAM STREETS - DAY

Gordon and his Men are in two-man teams. Gordon is walking

down the street with Miranda. He hands her a Geiger counter.

Blake is up on a rooftop. Gordon moves down to the other end

of the block. As the truck rumbles into view, Gordon's Men

walk out into the street in front of it as if crossing the

road. The convoy barely slows. Miranda gives Gordon the

signal. As the truck comes past, he tosses a magnetic GPS

locator at the lower part of the truck...

Gordon regroups with his Men on the corner. Checks his GPS.

They keep moving, turning down the next street...into an

ambush. Dozens of Mercenaries, weapons trained.

Blake, from his vantage point, watches Gordon, Miranda and

the other Cops being rounded up and led away...

INT. BASEMENT, ABANDONED STOCK EXCHANGE - DAY

Miranda comforts a crying Woman in the corner. Thugs come

down the stairs, laughing, leading a Hooded Prisoner. They

kick him down the last step and he stumbles. Fox moves to

his aid.

They dump the Hooded Man with Fox.

Fox hears this. Pulls the bag from Wayne's head. Wayne nods

at him, silent. Fox nods back. The Thugs leave. Miranda

comes over.

Catwoman comes down the stairs with the Thugs.

The thugs pull Wayne and Fox to their feet - Miranda looks

up.

EXT. COLONNADE, HOLDING AREA - CONTINUOUS

The Thugs lead Wayne and Fox along the colonnade. Catwoman

spins, takes out one Thug with a heel, one with a punch to

the throat. Fox smiles as she unlocks his wrists.

And she's gone. Fox turns to Wayne. Who shrugs.

INT. DARK SPACE - NIGHT

Lights flicker on... Wayne and Fox are in the Bat-Bunker.

sets, Fox starts pulling apart the gun mount.

EXT. GOTHAM RIVER - NIGHT

Gordon and the rest of the men stand at the edge of the ice.

A Mercenary fires his gun in the air. Gordon takes a breath,

then leads his men onto the ice...which creaks and groans...

Further out, Gordon stops - sniffs - looks down: a pool of

liquid, beside it: a flare. Gordon picks it up, puzzled.

Gordon, energized by the familiar voice, lights the flare -

jams it into the liquid, sending a trail of FIRE across the

ice - up into a building where it forms the shape of a

BAT...

INT. FOLEY'S BROWNSTONE - CONTINUOUS

Blake...

EXT. GOTHAM RIVER - CONTINUOUS

Batman hands Gordon a metal box.

EXT. OUTFLOW PIPE, ACKERMAN PARK - CONTINUOUS

Blake takes out a second Mercenary - moves over to the open

manhole. Ross emerges - nots at Blake, who helps him climb

out. BANG - Ross goes down as Blake dives for cover. Blake

is grabbed by Mercenaries. They detonate the manhole,

sealing it, prepare to execute Blake. A dark shape drops

onto the Mercenaries... Blake watches, in awe, as Batman

takes them out in a fury of punches and kicks - then it is

finished. Quiet. One of the Mercenaries moves slightly.

Batman boots him in the head as he moves towards Blake.

Blake laughs. Then feels the back of his neck. Batman tosses

Blake a mini-mine.

They throw the mini-mines at the rubble of the entrance -

the blasts barely move any rubble.

Batman disappears into the shadows.

KAABOOOM! The Bat's cannons light up the night.

Cops climb out into the cold night - skinny, ragged, but

glad to be alive and carrying guns...

Blake nods. Turns to leave. Stops.

Batman nods. Blake disappears into the night.

EXT. GOTHAM STREET - CONTINUOUS

Gordon checks the metal box. Puts it under his coat. Nods at

his men, hiding in the doorways. Checks his GPS...

EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

Batman leads Catwoman to a rusty old container. He opens it,

revealing the Bat-Pod. Catwoman's eyes light up.

She hops on, feeling the controls.

Catwoman marvels at the controls...

VARROOOM!

She shakes her head.

He looks at her.

She stares back at him. Facade slipping a touch.

He says nothing. She looks at him, imploring.

Batman turns. Catwoman watches him go. Then fires up the

bike and takes off.

EXT. STREETS LEADING TO SOUTH TUNNEL - NIGHT

Catwoman tears along on the Bat-Pod. She pulls up at the

tunnel entrance blocked by stacked vehicles.

EXT. DOWNTOWN STREETS - DAWN

The army of Cops stands at the low end of the street. At the

op is Bane's stronghold - City Hall. Men pour out of the

building, forming up into an opposing line.

A Cop wearing full dress blues steps forward. It is Foley.

The silence is eerie... The numbers look evenly matched -

until two Tumblers arrive.

The Cops look shaky, pale, but determined.

He steps forward. The line follows.

EXT. CITY HALL - CONTINUOUS

Bane stands in the colonnade. Watching.

EXT. STREET, DOWNTOWN GOTHAM - CONTINUOUS

The Tumblers FIRE into the line of Cops, THROWING men into

the air, SCREAMING. The line of Cops is about to scatter -

WHOOOSHHH. The Bat DROPS down in front of the Cops and

BLASTS both Tumblers, FLIPPING them sideways. The Bat RISES

and the cops run towards the Mercenaries, firing - until

they are close enough to fight hand-to-hand. The street is

filled with thousands of men in pitched battle.

EXT. STREETS LEADING TO SOUTH TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

blockage...the dust settles. Her path is clear.

Batman ducks, weaves and smashes his fists into Bane's side.

Someone is watching from the window of City Hall - Miranda.

EXT. GOTHAM STREET - CONTINUOUS

The black truck rounds the corner. Gordon signals his man in

a Greyhound bus - who pulls across the street. The truck

bomb. Wrong truck.

They sprint for the next parallel avenue...

roars between them, separating them. Batman chases after.

INT. LOBBY, CITY HALL - CONTINUOUS

Bane SMASHES backwards through the door, Batman on him.

Batman POUNDS Bane against the marble floor. Mercenaries

guarding Miranda move towards them -

Bane SMASHES Batman's head - moves in for the kill, but

Batman SMASHES Bane to the ground, RIPS sideways across the

tubes of Bane's mask with the blades of his forearm. Bane

bellows, thrashing in AGONY. Batman holds him down with a

hand on his throat - searches him with his free hand.

Bane's thrashing calms as he stares at Batman through

pain-soaked eyes...gasping through his broken mask for

relief.

Bane looks at Batman, curiosity behind his pain.

Batman flinches, frozen as Miranda leans into his ear...

Miranda has a knife through Batman's suit, into his ribs...

She pulls out the trigger...

EXT. FIFTH STREET - CONTINUOUS

Gordon spots the second black truck moving down the street.

His men pull in front, slowing it. Gordon jumps into the

back. The truck accelerates - Gordon drops, hanging on to

the bumper, struggling with the box, trying to turn it on...

INT. LOBBY, CITY HALL - CONTINUOUS

Batman cannot move to defend himself. He has Bane by the

throat, but Miranda has her knife in his side -

INSERT CUT: the child, Talia, makes eye-contact with the

Protector, then leaps. Down below, Prisoners swarm over the

protector, ripping the muslin from his face. Bane looks up

at Talia, says one quiet word -

Then is overrun.

INSERT CUT: Young Talia stands by the hole looking out at

the landscape...

Talia reaches up to touch Bane's mask.

Talia reaches up to Bane's mask, reconnects his tubes,

tenderly.

Bane nods at her, slowly. Talia moves out with the

Mercenaries.

EXT. CITY HALL - CONTINUOUS

Talia gets into a Tumbler with a Mercenary. Three Tumblers

minutes...

EXT. GOTHAM BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

Blake turns back to the Uniform.

Blake walks. Shots ring out at his feet. He keeps walking...

EXT. GOTHAM STREETS - CONTINUOUS

The Bat descends on the convoy, Catwoman approaches on the

ground. A rolling battle ensues. Catwoman targets the rear

of the Tumblers, Batman swings the Bat in low at the

junctions, trying to force the convoy east...

The Tumbler's gun turrets swing around onto Catwoman. She

swerves to avoid heavy fire.

EXT. GOTHAM BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

Blake continues to walk, ignoring the warning shots.

His partner arms the detonator. Uniform shouts at Blake -

As Blake looks, disbelieving, the bridge in front of him

blasts upwards in a massive fireball. Blake dives backwards.

EXT. GOTHAM STREETS - CONTINUOUS

The Bat blasts away in front of the convoy, making a huge

crater in front of a Tumbler and trapping it, rear in the

air. Catwoman dodges around it, uses the Bat-Pod cannons to

take out another Tumbler... The countdown ticks away...seven

minutes.

INT. REACTOR PLANT - CONTINUOUS

As Fox fires up the reactor something catches his eye -

something is wrong...

EXT. GOTHAM BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

The smoke clears, Blake sees the impossible gap.

INT. BLACK TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

Gordon climbs out the back of the truck but is immediately

strafed by gunfire from the Tumblers. He dives back inside,

moves to the front of the trailer - looks at the bulkhead,

gauging the driver's position. Starts firing blind through

the bulkhead -

INT. CAB, BLACK TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

Bullets fly through the cab. The driver takes one, falls

into a hard right turn...

INT. TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

Talia smiles.

INT. REACTOR PLANT - CONTINUOUS

Fox runs to a ladder. Alarms sound. As he hits the ladder he

turns. A massive rumble builds - water SMASHES into the

reactor, flooding in from both directions.

EXT. GOTHAM STREETS - CONTINUOUS

Catwoman comes up behind the lead Tumbler. She blasts it

again and again - it flips diagonally into the path of the

black truck, causing the truck to lurch onto its side. Both

vehicles careen into the mouth of the tunnel.

INT. REACTOR PLANT - CONTINUOUS

Fox loops his arm around a rung of the ladder and braces as

a wave smashes into him, painfully...

EXT. TUNNEL ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

Gordon jumps out of the truck, opening the rear doors to

expose the glowing core. Catwoman pulls up on the Bat-Pod.

The Bat lands at the tunnel mouth. Gordon moves in to try

and grab the core but it is too hot.

Laughter. Gordon turns. Talia, lying half out the truck.

Dying.

INT. REACTOR PLANT - CONTINUOUS

Fox pulls himself above the rising whitewater -

EXT. TUNNEL ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

Gordon looks down at Talia. Batman is at his side.

Talia smiles as her eyes flutter closed. Gordon turns -

Batman is at the core, plunging his hands into the heat to

attach a hoist from the Bat.

Catwoman is at his side as he works.

She takes this in. He stands to face her.

She puts her arms around his neck. Kisses him. Batman moves

to the Bat, Gordon alongside.

Batman sits into the cockpit, then looks again at Gordon.

The canopy closes - and as the Bat fires up Gordon remembers

INSERT CUT: Gordon, in his uniform, wraps the overcoat

around the Young Bruce's shoulders, his eyes reassuring,

loving.

Gordon looks up to the cockpit -

- but is dusted by downdraft as the Bat RISES. Gordon LEAPS

out of the way as the core is dragged along and out of the

tunnel mouth.

The Bat struggles with the weight of the smoking core... A

building is in the way - Batman fights the controls but

there's no power to get over it.

EXT. GOTHAM BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

Blake shouts into the bus -

Blake turns to him, furious.

An EXPLOSION from downtown Gotham. Blake looks across,

startled, turns to the children on the bus.

The smallest of the boys stares through the window past

Blake.

Blake turns to see the Bat thundering out of the heart of

Gotham, trailing smoke, the core hanging from it. It curves

dangerously close to the bridge before heading for the mouth

of the river...the bay...the ocean...

Until a point of light fires into an enormous nuclear BLAST

- wind and light and dust blowing VIOLENTLY but harmlessly

over the bridge, the tunnel mouth, all of Gotham...

As the nuclear dawn fades over Gotham, and we see its

inhabitants start to raise their heads, and helicopters and

boats converge on the island, we hear a voice. Jim Gordon.

Blake pulls out his badge. Throws it into the river.

EXT. GARDENS, WAYNE MANOR - DAY

Gordon is reading from A Tale of Two Cities. Opposite is

Fox, arm in a sling, and Blake, grim. Another figure is

there, whose face we do not yet see...

Gordon closes the book, looking down at Bruce Wayne's grave.

Gordon looks up at the figure standing across from him...

Alfred. Tears streaming.

Fox places a gentle hand on Alfred's shoulder, then leaves.

family, turns to the grave beside Bruce's - the grave of

People file out as the Lawyer stands.

Blake approaches the Clerk. She smiles.

Blake realizes, offers her his driving license.

Blake smiles, embarrassed. Leaves.

Techs are examining the controls in the cockpit.

the trees.

EXT. CAFE, FLORENCE - DAY

reports...

Moving in on the waterfall from inside... Blake bursts

through, landing painfully on the shale inside. he gets to

his feet, moving cautiously into the cave...

EXT. MCU - NIGHT

Gordon bangs his files against the air duct, straightening

them. He stops. Sees something. The searchlight...fixed.

Gordon runs his fingers across a brand new, steel Bat

symbol... He looks up into the night...

INT. CAVE - DAY

Blake lights his torch...then ducks, crouching, as THOUSANDS

of SCREECHING creatures descend. BATS...

EXT. CAFE, FLORENCE - DAY

Alfred folds his paper. Pulls out his money, then stops,

seeing...across the tables, a familiar couple... Bruce

smiles at Alfred, who nods. Bruce turns back to the pretty

brunette in pearls. Selina. Alfred pays his bill, content.

INT. CAVE - DAY

Blake lifts his head, FEELING the bats all around him...

Blake RISES, and is SWALLOWED by the darkness of their wings

and we -

FADE OUT.

CREDITS.

THE END.
