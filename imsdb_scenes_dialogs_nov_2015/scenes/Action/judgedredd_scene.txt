ON THE ABC ROBOT 84

A huge, armored combat veteran. We HEAR the metal cage rattle

open. Rico approaches, crouches down and pulls a panel off the

robot's body.

Inside, the circuit cards have all been pulled from their

sockets.

Rico begins whistling... reveille. He pushes the boards back

in, hits the RESET button.

The ROBOT starts to WHIR. A GUSH of steam rises from its

powerful torso. The eyes glow RED. It stands to its eight foot

height, slowly turning like an arthritic old man.

Status. Commander. Mission.

Rico strikes a match on the robot, lights a cigar.

And, the moment he does, he knows without. looking that there are

two identical ones behind him.

They're garbed for combat, yet without even the trace of

humanity that seeps through a Street Judge's armor. These are

COMPUTER GRAPHICS illustrating these words APPEARS on screen.

Nine years ago, the Lawgiver Model

Two replaced the Lawgiver Model One.

The difference lies in two areas:

The computer chip and the ammunition

coding. Like the Model one, the

computer chip recognizes the

thumbcode of all Judges. Judges

may use each other's firearms; but

a suspect dare not use a Judge's

.weapon against "a Judge.

ANIMATION reminds us of this in non-gory fashion.

However, the ammunition coding in

the Model Two is not cued to the (X)

thumbcode recognition chip.

Instead, it is coded to the personal

DNA of the Judge using the weapon.

Listening carefully, wondering where this is going.

This is obtained in a download from

my medical files and upgraded

is reloaded. Each time a round is

chambered and fired, it is tagged

with the relevant DNA.

I hereby file formal charges of

make the arrest!

Certainly, Judge Hershey. However,

as per Mega-City Code Section 84,

Paragraph "A", I need authorization

from the Chief Justice to arrest

a Council Judge. Similarly, as

stated in Paragraph "B", same

Section, I need authorization from

any Council Judges to arrest a Chief

Justice. In this case, that would

be Chief Judge Griffin and Council

Judge Rico.

We need permission from them to

arrest.. .them?

Basically... yes. And without their

authorization you cannot file

charges, and without charges I

cannot violate Security and tell

you the location of the Lab.

I hope this is finally clear.. If

there aren't any other requests,

A mutation that made you a genetic

criminal!

Really? What's your excuse?

Rico, for God's sake, listen!

You're a defective copy yourself!

And now you're making more copies

You're lying! All you care about

is control! Well, the next batch

of Janus Judges won't be the puppets

you want... they'll be my brothers

and sisters, mine to control!

.sisters?

Why not? I'm going to breed some

more of me... the old fashioned way.

I'd like to be a fly on that wall.

You will be.

clearly for the first time.

My God. I never should have

started this. Never. But now I'll

finish it - i12.

He draws his Lawgiver! But it has barely cleared the holster

when the ABC robot grabs Griffin's wrist! It plucks the weapon

from his han as if he's a child, hangs on to him!

Griffy. You shouldn't have done

that. Fido is very loyal.

The robot grabs Griffin with its other hand. He's completely

off the ground now.

Let me go! Central! Help me!

I'm sorry, Chief Justice. The ABC

robot is not tied into my main

processor. Judge Rico has sole

voice control.

That's right, Griff. You gotta get

with this hi-tech stuff. Robot:

Tear off Judge Griffin's arms and

legs. Save his head for last.

CAMERA ADJUSTS as Griffin SCREAMS with fear - and then, as we

t:ne wall, the screams become far, far worse.

Well, in the uh, absence of any

How may I sex e you?

Send in the Clones.

LIGHTS, ACTION. The Lab is completely on line.

The clone incubators are on-line.

The first batch of clones from your

personal DNA can be hatched in eight

hours. Chief Justice Rico, how many

copies of you would you like?

Let's start with... a thousand.

CAMERA ADJUSTS to show the INCUBATORS as they begin to fill with

Lawmaster has just landed, DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF CAMERA.

i12ers:i12ev checks her Lawgiver. Dredd swing-cocks the Remington

ixe a Western Hero.

This looks like a really bad

neighborhood. I'll stay here and

watch the bike -

We might need you to shut down the

Janus system.

I. knew you were gonna say that.

Down there?

She checks a SCANNER.

263 INT. STATUE OF LIBERTY - TORSO - NIGHT 263

Dredd, Hershey and Fergie move down through the long-neglected

monument. BATS flutter past. Only Fergie ducks.

This is fraggy. No one's been up

here in a hundred years.

Someone's sure down below. Power

Surge... this way.

They come down to a CURVED LANDING. They walk along the

curve... to a dead end. More BEEPS. Everyone tenses.

No wait, it moved... over to...

As she turns to look around, the ABC Robot LUNGES OUT OF THE

SHADOWS, grabs her off her feet! She drops her Lawgiver and

scanner!

The robot holds Hershey with one hand - opens FIRE with the

other! Fergie is hit! Dredd throws the wounded hacker to

relative safety - swings up. the ancient Remington - FIRES at

the robot!

266 HERSHEY - IN THE ROBOT'S GRASP 266

She flinches even though she knows Dredd is aiming around her.

But Dredd's 30-30 bullets barely, dent the robot!

Man and robot advance on each other like Hong Kong gunmen,

BLASTING AWAY. Dredd's shots BOUNCE off the Robot's armor!

A0_1 - S7 CONTINUED: 267

a bullet hits a tendon-like CONTROL WIRE! It SNAPS!

269 BACK TO SCENE 269

With an electronic SCREAM the robot GOES DOWN! But it hangs

onto Hershey! Suddenly a PNEUMATIC DOOR slides OPEN. Rico and

_isa are there, backlit. Both armed.

Enough. Dredd. Drop your gun.

No.

Edsel, here still has another

Suddenly Ilsa grins. Laughs... and kicks it away.

She's such a tease.

Inside.

Dredd is taken away. CHUNG. The Pneumatic door closes, leaving

Hershey and Fergie in darkness with'the robot.

INT. JANUS LAB - WITH DREDD 2-

He's marched between Rico and Ilsa.

He looks a lot like you.

He is a lot like me.

I'm nothing like you.

The only difference between us,

Joseph, is that you destroyed your

life when you embraced the Law. I

destroyed the Law and embraced...-

life !

273 DREDD - CLOSE 273

Dredd reacts, startled to hear this twisted version of his own

earlier words.

RICO'S VOICE(cont'd)

And speaking of life... behold.

2-74 A : u` STS LAB - VERY WIDE - NIGHT 274

This is where we were born, brother!

Can you feel the magic? Come...

come, see where we began.

W:-.H DREDD 275

Drawn despite himself, he stands beside Rico, head turned up

like his clone brother's. They never looked more alike. Dredd

looks into the glass of the Incubator Chambers just above him.

Inside, still forming HUMAN SHAPES, male and female, suspended

in milky fluid.

Look at them. Full of promise.

The dawn of the new day.

(pause, turning)

The dawn of a new species.

276 INT. JANUS LAB - LANDING - NIGHT 276

The ABC stands guard, Hershey still in its metal grip. She

struggles but can't free herself.

Fergie groans, opens his eyes. He presses one hand against his

wound... then sees Hershey's predicament. Then he looks at the

robot from head to toe...

Dredd. I can't train them alone...

You have to help me: It's your (X)

birthright.

You get nothing from me, Rico.

You've betrayed the Law.

You... you dare mention betrayal

to me? I was your friend. More

then a friend! I was oyal to

you... and you Judged me! You sent

me up for nine years o frozen hell

in Aspen! And you dare say

"betrayal" to me?

He raises his Lawgiver, aims it between Dredd's eyes.

(dead serious) (X)

Dredd. Give me your word you'll

help me raise the kids.

When Aspen thaws, Rico. Go to hell.

Tense seconds. Rico grins boyishly, lowers the gun.

Aw. You knew I couldn't pull the

trigger. we're family.

He steps back. His face hardens. He SHOUTS.

Fido!

He's trying to keep Rico at bay, but he's clearly outgunned.

Reloading behind cover, he SEES Fergie in the doorway. Crawls

over to him. Fergie's ashen, his shirt soaked with blood.

Fergie.

Say it, Dredd.

Pause.Then Dredd remembers.

I. I made a mistake. I... I'm

sorry I misjudged you.

And you'll never arrest me again.

And I'll never arrest you again.

Damn straight.
