FADE IN:

INT. C-130 HERCULES TURBO-PROP - NIGHT

Eighteen combat-ready special forces, wearing assault black,

jump packs and combat gear, stare down the deep end of a

greasy ramp into the night sky.  Village lights flicker 19,000

feet below.

The STRIKE FORCE LEADER signals to his team.

Without a moment's hesitation, they dive into the darkness

and plummet toward earth.

EXT. MANSION - NIGHT

A military GUARD, old Soviet-style uniform, rounds the corner

of the large estate toting an AK-47.

A red laser dot appears briefly on his forehead and, after a

beat, the red dot seems to bleed.  The Guard collapses dead.

Two other GUARDS are dispatched with single, silenced shots.

A Strike Team member at a junction box awaits a signal.

Through infra-red binoculars the strike Force Leader watches

his assault troops as they take positions.

On the estate - as the power goes out.  The team on the

mansion's front porch pops the door and pours in.

INT. MANSION - NIGHT

FOLLOWING - the FIVE TEAM MEMBERS as they rush a stairway in

phalanx formation.  They nearly knock over an old lady, who

in turn lets out a blood curdling scream.

UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR -

The team kicks open a door.  Rushes into the room.

INT. BEDROOM -

Assault weapons pointed at the bed.  The soldiers yank back

bedsheets to reveal IVAN STRAVANAVITCH, a middle-aged man

and his half-naked 18-year-old concubine.

The soldiers pull Stravanavitch to his feet and haul him out

of the room.

FOLLOWING -  As they push down the hallway.

MANSION SECURITY GUARDS rally with haphazard gunfire.

Out come the strike force's flash-bang grenades.  Exploding

everywhere, disorienting Stravanavitch's men.

EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

Signal flares burn as a helicopter descends on the position.

The Strike Team evacuates across the field and forces a

struggling Stravanavitch into the low-hovering copter.

The commandos swiftly board the craft as a handful of

Stravanavitch's guards break into the clearing.  They open

fire.

And the mounted machine guns on the helicopter return.

One of the Strike Team members takes a bullet to the neck.

He's' pulled by his comrades into the chopper as it lifts

into the sky, its guns spitting lead...

STRIKE FORCE LEADER (V.0.)

Archangel, this is Restitution.

Archangel, this is Restitution.  The package is wrapped.

Over.

The DING, DING, DING of a SPOON tapping against a wine glass.

SUPER TITLE:   "MOSCOW - THREE WEEKS LATER

FADE IN:

INT. BANQUET ROOM - NIGHT

Hundreds of men and women in formal evening wear sit at round

banquet tables.  A HUSH falls over the guests as the DINGING

continues.  All attention turns to the front table.

A rotund, silver haired-man in his late sixties rises and

sidles past U.S. and Russian flags up to the podium

microphone.  He is STOLI PETROV, President of Russia.

Petrov's harsh Russian issues through the room.  But over it

we hear a young woman's voice translating.

AT THE FRONT TABLE -

A translator's words ring in the earpiece of a handsome man

in his mid-forties.  Worry lines crease his forehead and the

touch of gray at his temples attest to three very difficult

years in office.

This man is JAMES MARSHALL, and he is the PRESIDENT of the

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.  He busily makes last minute changes

to his speech.

Mr. President.

Thunderous applause as Marshall rises and approaches the

podium.

At the back of the room, DOHERTY, a senior policy adviser

whispers to the President's Chief of Staff ED SHEPHERD...

The applause dies as Marshall begins to speak.

The room remains silent a few beats.  Most guests respectfully

bow their heads.

Marshall begins again, but this time in English.  The young

woman translates simultaneously for the Russian audience.

Applause from the audience.  Marshall turns the page on his

speech.

During the applause, Marshall pulls a page from the speech,

folds it and slides it into his pocket.  He removes his

glasses and looks out into the crowd.  His tone becomes more

personal.

He's not reciting the speech anymore.

Terror is not a legitimate system of government.  And to

those who commit the atrocities I say, we will no longer

tolerate, we will no longer negotiate, and we will no longer

be afraid.  It's your turn to be afraid.

Applause rolls through the crowd.

EXT. MOSCOW INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - NIGHT

Sprawling terminals spread out to runways like tentacles.

ON THE TARMAC -

Bathed in floodlights, perched majestically on the runway,

dwarfing nearby commuter and military jets, stands...

A RUSSIAN NEWS VAN emerges from the darkness and pulls to a

stop by a Secret Service barricade.

SPECIAL AGENT GIBBS greets the Russian news team that emerges.

Please present your equipment to Special Agent Walters for

inspection.

The news team's segment producer, a crusty old Russian named

KORSHUNOV raises his big bushy eyebrows.

Though we wish to extend your press service every courtesy,

you will comply with our security measures to the letter.

Korshunov and the FIVE MEMBERS of his news crew present their

video cameras, sound equipment and supplies to Special Agent

WALTERS for inspection.  Secret Service DOGS sniff through

the baggage.

Korshunov puts his thumb on the ID pad of a portable computer.

The computer matches up his thumbprint with his dossier and

photograph.  "CLEARED" flashes on the computer screen.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

The President, walking with his entourage.

The President exits the building and enters his limousine.

EXT. TARMAC - AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT

Walters hands the bags back to the Russians.

They ascend into the belly of Air Force One.

EXT. STREETS OF MOSCOW, PRESIDENT'S MOTORCADE - NIGHT

Winding its way down narrow cobblestone streets onto a major

thoroughfare.

INT. PRESIDENTIAL LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

The limousine is packed with advisers, aides, military staff,

including LT. COL. PERKINS, the keeper of the NUCLEAR FOOTBALL

handcuffed to his wrist.  In the b.g. on the limo's television

set, the LARRY KING SHOW indulges in its normal banter.

Marshall wearily rubs his temples as he stifles a yawn.

Marshall's watch alarm beeps and he automatically reaches

into his breast pocket, pulls out a medicine vial and downs

two pills with a coffee chaser.

On the T.V.

Shepherd turns up the volume.

Marshall mutes the television.  A quiet moment.

Marshall considers.  Then decides.

INT. AIR FORCE ONE, CORRIDOR, TRAVELING - NIGHT

Maria Mitchell escorts the Russians down the plane's length.

As they pass the galley, Maria motions up a set of stairs.

They walk by several conference rooms, running down the

starboard side of the plane.

Past the conference rooms, they walk by a small side room

where SECRETARIES work on computers, generating documents.

The REAR PRESS CABIN, just ahead of the rear galley and bank

of bathrooms.  A handful of disgruntled reporters feign sleep.

Mitchell exits forward.  One of the reporters stirs and looks

up at the news team.  He groans.  Space is a premium back

here.

Korshunov trades looks with his news team.

EXT. MOSCOW INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - NIGHT

The President's motorcade pulls up in front of Air Force

One.

INT. AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT

The President and his entourage ascend from the lower deck

platform onto the main deck.  COL. DANIEL AXELROD, Air Force

One's pilot, snaps off a salute as he passes.

Marshall nods as he pulls off his bow tie and enters his

stateroom.  Shepherd follows two steps behind.

Marshall halts Shepherd with a gesture.

Shepherd nods and waits by the door.  Lt. Col. Perkins takes

a seat outside the Presidents stateroom and opens the latest

Tom Clancy thriller, using the nuclear football as a lap

desk.

INT. PRESIDENT'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

Marshall collapses on the couch, rubs his eyes, then closes

them.  A moment of peace in a breakneck day.

The knock at the door jars him.

Shepherd enters.

President Marshall picks up one of the many phones in his

office.

*                               MARSHALL

Forget it, Shep.  The kid gave his life for his country and

the

Speaker's a bastard for turning him into a sound bite.  I'll

take the heat.  Understood?

A STEWARD enters the room.

The steward nods and disappears from the room.

Marshall picks up a stack of policy reports.  Thumbs through

them.

The steward arrives with the Russian beer.  Marshall takes a

swig.  He swallows hard.  Piss-water.  Marshall crosses to

his sink and pours the beer out.  He hands the bottle to the

steward.

The steward nods...

AND SLINKS AWAY WITH THE BOTTLE. MARSHALL CATCHES HIMSELF --

Marshall picks up the phone again.

INT. AFO'S MISSION COMMUNICATION CENTER - NIGHT

THREE Air Force SPECIALISTS man the elaborate communication

system occupying much of the upper deck.  Top-of-the-line

computers, communication systems, video decks, and satellite

receivers.

He slides in a videotape and channels the feed to the *

president's stateroom.

INT. PRESIDENT'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

A monitor comes to life with a basketball game.

Shepherd exits as Marshall settles into his leather chair

and dives into work.  He punches a button on the speakerphone.

EXT. AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT

The Marine Guards snap to attention once again as the First

Lady's motorcade arrives.

ROSE MARSHALL, a self-assured woman with an aristocratic

gleam, alights from her limo.  She takes a few steps, then

turns, tapping her foot impatiently.

Your father's gonna have a fit.

ALICE, the President's 13-year-old daughter, straggles out

of the car, rolling her eyes.

INT. MAIN DECK, AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT

As the First Lady's entourage enters.

Again, Alice rolls her eyes.

Rose pulls Alice aside.

Alice toes her foot into the carpet as she releases an

exasperated sigh.  She is, in this moment, the patron saint

of know-it-all 13-year-old girls.  Alice waves toward the

Presidential Suite.

With the weight of the entire world on her shoulders, Alice

Collapses into one of the many leather chairs.  It seems to

swallow her.  JORY, a steward passes.

Alice eyes the swirl of Aides who are pretending to work

nearby.

But it's obvious that they're eavesdropping.  Alice smiles

and waves at them dramatically.

Rose nods, smiling a half-smile.  After a thoughtful beat,

Alice gets up and crosses to the Presidential suite.  She

exchanges words with the Aide standing outside the door and

comes back, covering her disappointment.

Joey the steward hands her her cocoa with a wink and a smile.

Her eyes light up at the mound of whip cream on top.

A quiet pause, then...

The plane jolts forward as it begins to taxi.

Alice points.  And as if on cue, Marshall exits from his

office and checks his watch.

Alice nods.

Alice rises and hugs her father.  A White House PHOTOGRAPHER

snaps off a few shots for the papers.  Alice makes a face at

them.  A second later, Shepherd comes up the corridor,

breaking up the pair.

As Marshall moves toward the conference room, he bends and

gives Rose a quick peck on the cheek.  It all reeks of

formality.

INT.  PRESIDENT'S OFFICE.

Rose shuts the door behind them.  As she starts to speak,

Marshall pulls her into a long passionate kiss.  Rose pulls

away.

I've gotta go stop a war.

He takes her in his arms.

Long beat. He smiles at her, it's the same sweet smile that

won her heart, the same smile that got him elected. She

softens.

She smiles. The tension breaks.

They kiss again, this time for real. But... a knock on the

door.

Shepherd opens the door.

Rose rolls her eyes.

Marshall heads for his meeting.

EXT. COCKPIT - NIGHT

Col. Axelrod and his co-pilot LT. COL. ARTHUR INGRAHAMS are

at the wheel.

EXT. RUNWAY - NIGHT

A picture perfect take-off as Air Force One slides through

the moonlight and skates upward on a sheet of air.

EXT. AIR FORCE ONE, FLYING - AN HOUR LATER

Airborne in the midnight sky.

INT. AIR FORCE ONE, GALLEY - NIGHT

Aircraft engines drone.

CLOSE ON - A coffee pot pouring piping joe into a mug

emblazoned with ubiguitou Presidential Seal. The mug is placed

on a tray with a half-dozen other mugs and passed to a STEW.

He carries the tray down the corridor past passenger cabins.

Drowsiness has overtaken the plane. Many of the passengers

and aides are asleep. CNN plays On T.V. sets, entertaining

the few night owls and news junkies.

Toward the front of the plane, the steward enters the

conference room.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

As the steward closes the door behind him, all background

noise disappears. We are in a sound shielded room. Even the

engines' drone cannot be heard.

The lights in the room are dim as MAJOR CALDWELL, a military

advisor, projects satellite photos of Iraqi military bases

onto a screen.

The steward serves coffee as unobtrusively as he can while

the meeting continues.

We follow the steward as he slips out of the conference room

and back into the...

INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

with a few coffees left on his tray. One of them is scooped

up by Gibbs as he passes, his nose is buried in a fax.

INT. SECRET SERVICE CABIN - NIGHT

Gibbs leans in the cabin.

Special Agents Walters and JOHNSON rise and follow Gibbs

into an adjoining office.

INT. OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Gibbs closes the door behind the two agents. As Walters and

Johnson take their seats, Gibbs WITHDRAWS HIS WEAPON and...

SHOOTS each of the agents in THE BACK OF THE HEAD.

Silenced pistol. Blood all over the desk. Gibbs removes each

of the agent's weapons and slips them into his waistband. He

waits a few beats, takes a long sip of coffee, then exits

the office.

INT. SECRET SERVICE CABIN - NIGHT

As he passes through the cabin he takes a silent inventory.

Five other agents working, sleeping, on the phone.

INT. PRESS CABIN - NIGHT

Gibbs nods to Korshunov. Korshunov nods one of his men.

NEVSKY removes one of his videotapes, pops the front cover

exposing the tape. Across the face of the tape is a thin

strip of a rubbery substance. Nevsky pulls the strip up and

out, making a kind of fuse. He reaches for a pack of

matches... courtesy matches, sporting the Seal of the

President.

Nevsky nods and lights the fuse.

IN A RAPID SUCCESSION -

GIBBS tosses his two extra weapons to Korshunov's men, pivots

the corner and begins firing at his colleagues. The SECRET

SERVICE AGENTS try to get at their weapons, but Gibbs has

caught them completely off-guard.

Several silenced central nervous system shots (head and neck)

and the five agents slump back, their red blood cascading

down the creases of the fine Corinthian leather chairs.

Nevsky tosses the cassette up the corridor... smoke pours

out of it. Smoke screen.

BAZYLEV and ZEDECK catch the guns Gibbs tossed and hold them

on the reporters.

Bazylev grabs the stunned reporters, yanking them into the

aisle.

Human shields. A half dozen of them.

Behind the terrorists, one of the bathroom doors swings open.

A SECRET SERVICE AGENT emerges. Sees what's happening. Reaches

for his gun. ZEDECK fells him with a well placed unsilenced

GUN SHOT. SCREAMS ensue...

INT. FORWARD CABIN - NIGHT

A sleeping SECRET SERVICE AGENT bolts upright. HEARS MORE

SHOTS.

He springs up and moves toward the gunshots, his weapon drawn.

INT. SECRET SERVICE CABIN - NIGHT

Bazylev and Zedeck lay down a suppressing fire outside the

door.

Korshunov, Nevsky and VLAD follow Gibbs into the Secret

Service office. Gibbs opens a locker and pulls out a stash

of MP5 automatic assault rifles and bullet-proof vests.

Korshunov raises his bushy eyebrows in delight.

INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

The Secret Service agent fights his way through the smoke to

a wall panel. Punches a red buttoned intercom.

INT. AIR FORCE ONE'S FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT

A red light on the security panel lights up...

Cot. AXELROD Cabin/Flight Deck: Code Red Acknowledged...

Shit.

Axelrod toggles his headset to secure line.

INT. RAMSTEIN AIR BASE, AIR TRAFFIC CONTHOL TOWER - NIGHT

SUPER - "RAMSTEIN AIR BASE, GERMANY"

Hunched over a control terminal, the AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER

tracks Air Force One's radar image.

The WATCH OFFICER springs into action, picking up a phone.

The controller hits a red button on his console. Sirens flare

up and klaxons wail across the base.

The controller looks down to his runways. In the light of

the moon he sees a half-dozen men rushing toward F-15 Eagles.

The once sleepy midnight control room cranks into full crisis

mode.

INT. AIR FORCE ONE, MISSION COMMUNICATIONS CENTER - NIGHT

Pandemonium. GUNFIRE pops in the b.g. Air Force Specialists

try to get the word out.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

The conference room door bursts open and TWO SECRET SERVICE

AGENTS, weapons drawn, enter the room and run to Marshall.

The once quiet room floods with light. The sounds of a

gunfight and a blanket of smoke sweeps into the cabin.

The agents lift Marshall to his feet, and practically carry

him from the room, leaving the other high ranking officials

to scramble for themselves in a cacophony of shouts.

FORWARD CORRIDOR -

Perkins, carrying the nuclear football, ducks and weaves his

way down the corridor into the fray. He takes a bullet to

the shoulder, which fells him.

NEAR THE FORWARD GALLEY -

Alice is nearly trampled by agents responding to the gunfire.

One agent grabs her and shoves her into a bathroom.

GUNFIRE pops all around her.

INT. CORRIDOR, REAR CABINS - NIGHT

Smoke, automatic weapons fire. Secret service agents battling

the terrorists. Aides, diplomats, crew and personnel caught

in the crossfire.

A spray of weapons fire overhead and everyone hits the floor.

INT. AIR FORCE ONE, FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT

RAMSTEIN A.B. CONTROLLER (RADIO)

Air Force One Heavy, you are cleared for priority divert,

Ingrahams locks the cockpit door.

EXT. SKY - NIGHT

Air Force One banks into a curve and descends through broken

clouds.

INT. PRESIDENTIAL STATEROOM - NIGHT

The sounds of gunfire have reached the the nose of the plane.

Rose peers out to see what's the matter. An armed Secret

Service agent runs toward her.

A spray of bullets mows him down. He collapses in the door

frame. Terrified, Rose tries to close the door, but the dead

agent is in the way.

INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Filled with smoke and gunfire. The agents rush the President

behind a forward bulkhead.

Marshall looks up the hallway toward his stateroom.

DOWN THE CORRIDOR -

Gibbs fires.

HITS - One of the Secret Service agents in the shoulder.

Blood blossoms through his clothes but he winces it off.

The Secret Service agents whisk the President to the front

stairwell. They pull up a floor panel, revealing stairs

descending toward the baggage deck.

INT. BATHROOM -

Alice, huddled atop the commode.

Alice opens the door and rushes...

INTO THE CORRIDOR...

Tripping and falling over Joey, the steward. His dead eyes

swim in a pool of blood that was his face. Alice screams,

scrambling to her feet.

MID-PLANE CORRIDOR -

Perkins manages to push himself to his feet and stumbles

down the hall into the computer room. Terrorist SERGE spots

the nuclear football dangling from his wrist. He pursues.

INT. COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT

Hysterical SECRETARIES feverishly dump classified documents

into a shredder, while Perkins struggles to open the black

leather briefcase handcuffed to his wrist.

Bullets tear up the doorknob lock arid SERGE kicks in the

door.

The Fawn Halls hit the floor as gunfire sprays overhead. But

Perkins swings around brandishing his sidearm. He opens fire

on Serge, but the bullets smack harmlessly against the SWAT

vest.

Serge returns fire, ripping up Perkins who collapses over

the shredder, and with his last bit of strength, he dumps

out the briefcase.

Papers containing NUCLE WAR STRATEGIES and MISSILE LAUNCH

CODES slide into the hungry Shredding machine. Perkins manages

a slight smile before he keels over dead, his duty fulfilled.

The shredded remains of the nuclear football rain over his

head like tickertape at a hero's parade.

EXT. SKY - NIGHT

The pale moon catches shiny streaks of metal that descend

through the broken clouds. The Squadron of F-15 Eagles drops

into formation around Air Force One.

INT. FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT

Gun shots right Outside the cockpit door.

INT. LOWER DECK OF AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT

Beneath the main cabin, the Secret Service agents run the

President through the forward baggage compartment and the

lower galley: a large room with compartments, storage freezers

and food preperation tables.

On the far side of the galley, the agents fling open a

hatchway and enter...

A NARROW GANGWAY - running between the lower galley and the

rear baggage hold, flanked on either side by the landing

gear bays.

They duck under wing supports until they come to a mesh

grating.

The uninjured agent lifts the grating revealing an ESCAPE

POD.

Marshall freezes.

A second later gunfire rips Up the agent's face. The new

volley sends Marshall under the cover of a wing strut. The

second agent takes Position and returns fire. He quells the

incoming volley for a moment.

The firing begins again. Marshall struggles with the decision.

The agent shoves in a fresh clip...

The agent combat-rolls into the open and fires. He advances

down the gangway acting as a shield for the president,

shooting blindly.  Marshall watches as he's hit repeatedly,

but it gives him the time he needs to dive for the pod.

REVERSE ANGLE - VLAD AND NEVSKY

behind the bulkhead. When the agent drops, Nevsky and Viad

rush down the gangway. They arrive at the closed pod just as

it begins to slide on its rails. They let loose dozens of

rounds from their MP55, but the bullets just plink off.

The pod-lock doors slide shut. The President is on his way

to safety.

EXT. SKY - NIGHT

Small bay doors open in the belly of Air Force One, and a

human sized cannister drops from the bottom, its parachute

Opening instantly.

A light flashes On the panel.

INT. PRESIDENTIAL STATEROOM - NIGHT

Korshunov kicks open the door.

Gunfire from ROSE, who holds the dead secret service agent's

weapon. She empties the clip at the doorway. Click, click.

No more bullets. Korshunov steps into the room, brandishing

his automatic, smiling. Rose backs against the wall and raises

her hands.

slump over their controls.

The plane bounces. Is airborne for a second. Touches down

INT. CORRIDOR - AIR FORCE ONE - NIGHT

Terrorists lead hostages to the conference room. Everyone is

bounced around, slamming against walls, spilling over chairs.

A MASTER SERGEANT seizes the opportunity and grabs for

Chaos. Gibbs tries to pull Axelrod off the controls.

Zedek slams the throttle all the wa up. Spotlights and sirens

swirl outside the cockpit window.

EXT. RMMSTEIN FIELD - NIGHT

Air Force One closes in on the Starlifter. She's struggling

off

Gibbs senses that he's too close. He pulls way back on the

stick, risks stalling her out... but the bird responds.

EXT. RAMSTEIN FIELD - NIGHT

Air Force One barely clears the Starlifter, the edge of her

The sharpshooters, the emergency crews, the commandos from

Rose allows herself a half-sob of relief.

Eyes filled with hatred... Rose SLAPS Gibbs face.

Gibbs doesn't react.

INT. BAGGAGE DECK GANGWAY - NIGHT

Bruised and battered, some blood smeared across his tuxedo

shirt... PRESIDENT JAMES MARSHALL lowers himself from one of

the overhead wing struts.

He emerges into the bowels of Air Force one.

He stands quietly a moment, listening... for footsteps, for

gunfire. All quiet except for the whine of the jet engines.

He tak9s a moment to think. Considers his situation. His

eyes find the dead agent who risked his life so he could

make it to the pod. He trots down the gangway toward the

lower galley.

EXT. SKY - NIGHT

Air Force One hovers atop billowy peaks. The smaller F-15s

cluster around her in a loose formation.

Nevsky and Bazylev guard the conference room door as Korshunov

and Vlad enter. Nevsky hands Korshunov a copy of the plane's

manifest.

Korshunov nods and enters the room.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

Korshunov surveys the hostages. Viad covers them at gunpoint.

Rose holds Alice, comforting her.  shepherd, Doherty, Aides,

Advisors, Crew... Fifty of them huddle like sardines.

The plane's doctor administers to the wounded.

Korshunov stares down his captives.

Korshunov exits, with Viad backing out behind him. Leaving

the hostages alone. The sound of the door locking.

A mournful beat. Everyone looks at each other and the dead

and wounded victims of this heinous act...

Hushed conversation breaks out all over the room.

Caldwell paces, looks around the room.

INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT

The terrorists move toward the nose of the plane leaving

Nevsky to guard the conference room.

INT. BAGGAGE HOLD - NIGHT

President Marshall reaches the front stairway. Cautiously

climbs to the main cabin. As he reaches the top stairs, he

hears Russian conversation approaching. He ducks back into

the stairwell.

He can't see them, but he can hear them.

The terrorists pass within a few feet as they ascend to the

Mission Communications Center on the upper deck.

Marshall waits a few beats, listens to the silence. Then re-

mounts the stairs and almost runs into the back of...

Marshall FREEZES... looks past Viad down the corridor where

Nevsky guards the main conference room floor.

Unaware of Marshall, Viad reaches into his pocket and pulls

out a cigarette. Lights it. On the first puff he feels a

presence behind him.

VLAD slowly turns around...

Nothing there.

He smiles at his jittery nerves, turns back round.

REVERSE ANGLE -

Over Vlad's shoulder...

MARSHALL, flattened behind the edge of the galley divider.

He creeps away from Vlad toward the Presidential Suite...

stepping gingerly over dead secret service agents.

INT. MISSION COMMUNICATIONS CENTER -

*       Korshunov pulls a handkerchef from his breast pocket

and wipes the blood from a telephone headset.

Gibbs works the communications board, dialing in a series of

numbers. Telephone ringing...

INT. WHITE HOUSE SITUATION ROOM - DAY

A map of Air Force One's flight trajectory is displayed on

the rear screen. Moscow to Berlin and back toward the Black

Sea.

The assembled brass listens as Korshunov's voice slithers

off the speaker phone.

The phone clicks off. A silent beat in the room.

GENERAL CHARLES GREELY, head of the 87th Mechanized Air Wing,

the unit responsible for Air Force One, enters the room.

The Tech Officer indexes back on his computer.

A silent beat.

All eyes turn to Dean.

BLEW AND A WEEK AFTER THAT, THIS 19-

year-old kid, the pilot... he walks out of the jungle in

pretty bad shape. He survived the crash and finished the

mission... alone.

Most of the President's service record makes for dull reading

because most of what he did iarLZ ULirn.   History remembers

him for what he did aflar he got back to the states -- the

protests, the rallies -- But he was a soldier once, a damn

fine one.

INT. PRESIDENT'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

Marshall cautiously enters the room. Ready for action.

The room is empty, but it's been trashed by the firefight.

The sound of voices... coming from the Duke game which still

plays. Marshall hustles over to one of the secure phones.

It's dead. He tries the regular phone. Dead. Hangs it up in

disgust.

He steps on some glass. It's a broken frame holding a

PHOTOGRAPH of Alice and Rose. He picks up the photo and lays

it on a table.

He thinks for a beat... glances around the room, searching...

Then he crosses to the closet, opens it and begins rifling

through his wardrobe.

INT. MAIN CONFERENCE ROOM.

Caldwell stands on the conference table. The hostages have

removed one of the ceiling panels. Air supply ducts and

bundles of wiring run through the ten-inch space between the

ceiling and the shielding plates.

Rose looks around the room. Hopeless. Her eyes land on the

carpet...

INT. CORRIDOR.

Marshall opens the stateroom door and slowly slides into the

corridor.

Vlad still faces the opposite direction.

Marshall creeps down the hallway, when...

Beep... Beep... Beep...

Marshall's watch alarm goes off.

Marshall dives for the nearest doorway. Vlad swings round to

see a figure slip into the senior staff cabin.

Vlad, unsure of what he saw., cautiously heads toward the

staff cabin. As he nears, he bends over a dead Secret Service

agent and pulls up the lifeless wrist revealing abeening

watch. It wasn't Marshall's after all. No matter. Vlad

continues to the staff Cabin.

INT. STAFF CABIN - NIGHT

Marshall frantically searches for something he can use as a

weapon. In the room: some video monitors, leather chairs and

phones. stainless steel cabinets run the length of one of

the walls.

Marshall throws the cabinet doors open, revealing...

A fully stocked MEDICAL CENTER... fold-down operating

table... high-intensity lights. Equipped to deal with any

medical emergency the president might encounter.

But too late. Vlad kicks the door open.

Marshall yanks down the operating table, and it smashes into

Vlad, knocking him down. Marshall lunges with his knife, but

Vlad OPENS FIRE. A HALF DOZEN ROUNDS pump into Marshall's

belly. He's thrown back against the wall, then slumps to the

floor.

Vlad approaches the crumpled body. Leans down to examine his

victim. He cups his hand under the man's chin and lifts his

head. Recognizes him.

But Marshall's eyes flash open.

He springs, shoving the butcher knife under the flack jacket

and into Vlad's spleen. Vlad freezes, unsure of what just

happened.

Marshall is on his feet. Never letting go of the twisting

knife, he grabs Vlad by the back of the head and slams his

face against the mirror above the surgical scrub sink. The

mirror shatters and streams of blood erupt cn the terrorist's

face. The blood drips down into the white porcelain sink,

swirling into the drain.

Vlad elbows Marshall in the neck, stunning him momentarily.

He wipes the blood from his face, spins and hits Marshall

with a devastating right cross. Marshall reels back against

the wall, and Vlad follows, shoving the MP5 into Marshall's

throat. Marshall grabs the gun near the trigger...

*                               VLAD

Don't move or I'll blow your head off.

Marshall presses the saftey button on the gun with his

forefinger, then knees Vlad in the balls. Viad pulls the

trigger repeatedly as he goes down, but nothing happens.

Instead he comes up swinging his gun butt against Marshall's

face. Like a bat hitting a baseball, it knocks Marshall into

the medical closet. The gun goes flying, skittering

UNDERNEATH A CABINET.

Marshall pulls himself up the shelves trying to keep his

legs from buckling. Vlad grabs some I.V. tubing and wraps it

around Marshall's neck. Marshall struggles for breath, clawing

at the tube.

HE SPOTS A DEFIBRILLATOR, REACHES AND SWITCHES IT ON. LOW-

pitched hum and beeping.

Marshall pulls his head forward, straining against the plastic

tubing. Then slams back into Vlad's head. Viad releases his

grip just for a moment...

The beeping becomes a steady whine.

... but a moment is all Marshall needs as he grabs the def

ib's CARDIAC PADDLES, turns, and SLAMS them on either side

of Vlad's head.

Vlad convulses from the shock for a full five seconds... his

eyeballs roll, his hair stands on end.  then he collapses to

the floor.

Marshall catches his breath for a moment. Pulls open his

shirt. Beneath it he wears a bulletproof Kevlar vest. He

lifts the vest and a half-dozen angry welts have blossomed

across his skin. The stuff may be bulletproof, but each of

Vlad's shots sting like a motherfucker.

EXT. CORRIDOR.

Nevsky walks down the corridor. Sees that Vlad is away from

his post.

*       INT. STAFF CABIN.

Marshall opens the medical cabinets, rifling through them.

Pulls out hypodermics, adrenalin, rubbing alcohol... arming

himself.

EXT. CORRIDOR.

Nevsky works his way up the corridor, peeking in rooms.

As he enters the...

INT. STAFF CABIN.

he's blinded by the high intensity surgical lights.

Marshall cracks a tank of anesthesia across Nevsky's heu

Nevsky goes down.

Marshall rips Nevsky's MP5 off of him. Holds it to Nevsky's

throat.

Nevsky says nothing.

The conference room, right? Right?

Marshall jerks him to his feet.

INT. CORRIDOR -

Marshall walks flevsky toward the mj vonteronve room3 As

they pass the stairs to the upper deck, Nevsky breaks away.

Marshall fires. Killing him.

No time for remorse. Marshall tries the Main conference Room

door. Locked. He knows the others will be coming so he

flattens himself against the corridor wall. Trains his gun

on the stairs.

Just as the terrorists descend, Marshall squeezes off a few

rounds. The terrorists edge back up the steps, returning

fire.

Marshall checks his clip, not many bullets left. He fires

off a few more shots to buy some time then ducks round the

corner and pulls out the bottle of rubbing alcohol and some

gauze.

The terrorists seize the moment of quiet, descending the

stairs to take position.

Marshall lights the gauze fuse of his new made Molatov

cocktail and throws it down the corridor. The bottle crashes

into a BALL OF FLAME. Catching Bazylev on fire. He yells,

drops and rolls. FIRE SUPPRESSING FOAM immediately sprays

down from overhead.

Serge hops Bazylev's burning body and heads down the corridor,

looking for this new wildcard. Korshunov grabs a fire

extinguisher from the galley and attends to Bazylev.

INT. CORRIDOR, TOWARD THE REAR OF AIR FORCE ONE.

Marshall retreats behind a divider. Sees Serge coming. Fires

a few rounds, then retreats to the next divider. Working

toward the rear of the plane.

Serge picks his way through the rear cabins, advancing

cautiously.

INT. REAR GALLEY/BATHROOMS.

Marshall's out of plane. Nowhere to hide in the galley.

Marshall eyes the bathrooms, doors flapping.

FOLLOWING SERGE...

as he reaches the rear galley and bathrooms. Marshall is

nowhere to be seen. But the bathroom doors are all closed.

Time for a deadly version of the shell game. serge fires

several rounds into the first closed bathroom door. The

bullets slice easily through the thin doors. He kicks the

riddled door open. The stall is empty.

Serge moves to the next one. Same procedure. It's empty.

Moves to the last bathroom, confident he's got him. He wails

with his MP5, turning the hatch into swiss cheese. Waits a

beat, then...

Kicks it in. It's empty too.

Serge looks around. Where the hell is this guy?

Serge reluctantly returns to his group.

INT. LOWER GALLEY, BAGGAGE LEVEL -

Marshall tumbles out of the cramped galley dumbwaiter,

breathing heavy. He slumps against the bulkhead and slides

down to the ground.

He takes a moment to pull himself together, to clear his

head. He hefts the MP5, refamiliarizing himself with the

weight and texture of a gun. He checks the clip. Only a

handfull of rounds left. He slaps it back in and switches

from automatic fire to single-shot then pantomimes firing.

Looking down the barrel of the gun, he notices bins loaded

with luggage.

Chandler hangs up the phone.

Northwood pops out of his huddle.

GENERAL NORTHWOOD

EXT. SKY - NIGHT

Air Force One, lit up by moonlight.

INT. CORRIDOR.

The fire is extinguished. Zedeck squats over Nevsky's body.

Gibbs and Serge maintain a defensive position, guns ready.

Bazylev emerges from the Senior staff Conference room. He

shakes his head "no". Korshunov nods and furrows his brow.

Wounded but alive. Serge, Bazylev...

Find him.

Serge and Bazylev lock and load, head off in separate

directions.

INT. MAIN CONFERENCE ROOM -

The hostages have torn up a section of carpeting. Caidwell

and Shepherd examine the floor. Smooth sheets of steel riveted

together. Pointless.

The door swings open and Gibbs and Korshunov enter. They

spots the ripped up carpeting.

They don't move. Korshunov raises his gun, points it a

Shepherd's head.

Doherty steps forward. Shepherd tries to pull him back, to

no

Korshunov SHOOTS Doherty through the head. Screams from some

of the hostages. Korshunov squeezes off a few shots to quiet

everyone.

Rose turns to the other hostages.

She locks eyes with Caldwell. HKeep working.N He nods.

INT. REAR BAGGAGE HOLD -

The President hunts through luggage. Overturned garment bags

and suitcases around him, belongings littered all over the

bulkhead. He sifts through heaps of clothing and finally

recovers what he's been looking for...

A CELLULAR PHONE...

He flips it open, starts to dial... but freezes.

He can't remember the number. He dials...

CLOSE.ON PHONE -555-1212... Information.

Bazylev, moving like a commando, slowly and methodically

works his way into the lower galley.

INT. REAR BAGGAGE HOLD -

Marshall. Finally, the phone picks up.

INT. PILOT'S REST AREA - NIGHT

The rest area consists of a couple of bunks behind the

cockpit area, still soiled black from the earlier C-4

explosion. Korshunov pours a cup of coffee and offers it to

Alice.

Gibbs wraps Rose's hands behind her back with duct tape.

Alice sits up, attentive.

Rose doesn't know whether to be pissed at Alice or proud of

her. Korshunov smiles, nods his head and lifts his gun.

He aims his gun at Alice.

A long beat, the Korshunov lovers the gun.

Once he hears our simple demand, I'm sure he will acquiesce.

For your sake.

Korshunov smiles. Gibbs grabs Alice's hands and pulls them

behind her back. Begins wrapping them with the tape.

INT. MAIN CABING, REAR GALLEY.

Serge searches through the galley cabinets, spots the galley

dumbwaiter. Now he knows where his quarry went.

He angrily grabs a service cart and shoves it into the

dumbwaiter, disabling it.

Bazylev hears the beeps of a phone dialing. He moves toward

the aft portal of the gangway.

Gunfire in the background.

Her face says N. The Switchboard operator pulls out a call

sheet and finds a number.

INT. REAR BAGGAGE HOLD -

On the phone, lying open on a heap of clothing.

Bazylev points the machine gun at Marshall's head.

Marshall doesn't move, his np5 hanging at his waist... his

hand inches from it.

Marshall... with no options... slowly moves his hands away

from the gun.

Bazylev motions Marshall to get on his knees. Marshall

complies.

Marshall pulls his shirt aside revealing his Kevlar vest.

INT. WHITE HOUSE SITUATION ROOM - DAY

Chandler on the phone. An aide waves, trying to get her

attention.

Caller's gone, but the line's still active.

The call comes in on speaker phone, distorted muffled voices

and the whine of an aircraft in the background.

Can we hear what's going on?

Dean picks up a phone.

INT. NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY,  LISTENING POST - DAY

WILLIS, a grossly overweight man in his late forties

surrounded by a monolith of high-tech, starts working his

Audio waveforms appear over Willis' console. He implements

digital filtering routines, cleaning up the sounds.

INT. WHITE HOUSE SITUATION ROOM - DAY

The group listens intently. The call modulates, distorts,

dissolves... then clarifies.

Understand?

Northwood stares up at the tactical board. Air Force One...

surrounded by the F-l5s.

General Northwood picks up a secure phone and dials.

INT. AFT STORAGE COMPARTMENT -

Marshall on his knees, hands behind his head. Bazylev, his

automatic pressed against Marshall's forehead, disarms

Marshall before stepping away. He slings Marshall's MP5 over

his own neck. Studies Marshall a beat.

Marshall stares straight ahead tn silent defiance. Bazylev

kicks him in the gut. Marshall doubles over, wheezing.

Bazylev grabs Marshall's hair and tugs his head back. He

holds Marshall with his eyes.

Bazylev slams Marshall's face against his knee. Marshall

slumps forward.

Marshall slowly rises to his feet. Bazylev swings wide around

him.

That is what they've always done.

The shock wave hits the aircraft.

Lights flicker and the plane rocks side to side.

HOSTAGES are bounced around the conference room.

INT. GANGWAY -

Marshall and Bazylev are slammed against the ceiling and

then the floor.

Marshall seizes the moment. Grabs Bazylev's gun. The two

struggle and Bazylez instinctively pulls the trigger. A burst

of richocheting gunfire sparks across the bulkhead.

The turbulence worsens. Bazylev manages to wrest away the

rifle, but the plane pulls into a climb, sending Bazylev

tumbling down the gangway into the rear baggage hold.

Marshall manages to pull himself up the grating and into the

galley. He's free, for the moment.

INT. AFO, COCKPIT.

Gibbs steadies the plane as the shock wave from the explosion

Bazylev pulls to his feet, heads back down the gangway.

INT. FRONT GALLEY.

Marshall greets Bazylev with a spray of hot coffee from the

Simmering pot as he enters. Bazylev covers up, but the spray

sears him pretty bad. He yells in pain, turning.

Marshall springs, imbedding the hypodermic needle into

Bazylev's neck. A full dose of adrenalin. Bazylev pulls the

empty needle from his neck. Marshall steps back, waiting for

a reaction.

A pregnant pause as they both wait to see what happens.

Then Bazylev smiles and slowly turns toward Marshall.

Marshall backs away as Bazylev levels his gun.

He fires once, hitting Marshall in the arm. Marshall winces

off the pain.

He backs Marshall against a wall and holds him in his sights.

But he doesn't shoot. His breathing becomes faster and faster

as the adrenalin takes hold. Building... building... He

screams and clutches at his throat.

His eyes spin back and then his heart explodes.

Bazylev is caught frozen, suspended in a moment of disbelief.

Death reflex. He fires off several rounds from the gun as he

collapses.

Marshall waits a beat, half-expecting Bazylev to rise. He

slowly approaches the body and retrieves the KP5.

He opens up a pack and puts the cigarette in his mouth. He

INT. FORWARD BAGGAGE COMPARTMENT - NIGHT

Zedeck, Spooked by the dark shadows, senses he's being

watched.

Zedeck hastens toward the Avionics compartment, gun at the

ready. Serge sweeps the area behind.

They hear a metallic clank echo and reverberate around him.

They both check left... right... behind them...

Nothing.

It's creepy being a walking target.

From behind a water storage tank, Marshall watches down the

barrel of his Mp5. With all the equipment in the way, it's

almost impossible to line up a clear shot.

And they're both well armed. He looks toward the stairway

instead.

Zedeck enters the Avionics compartment. Serge takes a

defensive position outside the door.

Serge hears a noise and opens tire.

Serge freezes.

Serge raises his hands. Marshall reaches over and pulls out

the clip to his MP5.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

Caldwell, Shepherd and a few other aides hear the key turn

in the lock. They quickly take position around the door. As

Marshall marches Serge in, they're both tackled and smothered

by the group. They wrest the guns away and shut the door

quickly behind them.

Marshall struggles against his people.

Surprised to hear their boss' voice, the aides and advisors

release Marshall.

MAJOR CALDWELL                   84.

Sir, maybe we can use this. Turn it to our advantage.

What do they have to lose?

INT. CORRIDOR.

Caidwell, holding Serge's gun, takes position by the front

Marshall and the Secretary step over Perkins' body on the

way to the fax machine.

Marshall grabs a piece of paper and a pen. Scribbles a note.

He signs the paper and hands it toher. She slides it into

the machine, checks the listed numbers and dials.

They wait... will it work? A few beats, a few beats more.

The machine pulls the paper in and begins scanning.

INT. WHITE HOUSE SITUATION ROOM.

Marshall's note spits out of one of the fax machines. But in

the bevy of activity, will it be noticed?

Marshall and the secretary arrive.

Caidwell crosses to prep the Launch Ramp controls.

Through the cockpit Window, the long metallic appendage

dangles ahead of the plane.

None of them changes his mind.

A silent beat. A few forced smiles in this very tense room.

The President crosses to one of his aides.

Marshall smiles.

EXT. SKY - NIGHT

The KC-135 flies above Air Force One, connected by a gasoline

umbilical cord.

INT. EMERGENCY RAMP PLATFORM.

Caldwell breaks safety glass. Reaches into a compartment and

pulls a lever.

A mechanical him and clank gives way to a rush of wind as

the tail section of Air Force One hinges open on hydraulic

struts, extending like a plank behind the plane. We can see

the sky with its angry clouds.

Rushing by at two hundred knots.

INT. FLIGHT DECK.

A LOUD BUZZ

A warning light flashes on the control panel. Tactical Video

Display shows the emergency parachute ramp activating.

INT. ITEAR BAGGAGE HOLD -

Zedeck reaches the emergency pressure door. Through the

porthole he sees the hostages getting away. He tries the

door hatch. Locked.

Zedeck looks around. Crosses to the lower rear galley.

He kicks open the panel on the stove. Rips out the propane

tank. He runs back and wedges the tank into the door lock.

He backs off 50 feet, turns and opens fire on the tank.

The tank explodes, blowing the door out.

EMERGENCY PARACHUTE LAUNCH PLATFORM

The pressure door blows open and an explosion of pressurized

air blasts through the platform.

The remaining parachutists are blown out the rear. Chutes

deploying.

Marshall and Serge are knocked down the ramp, tumbling toward

oblivion. Just as Marshall's about to slide off the corner

of the ramp he grabs its hydraulic strut.

Plummeting death.

His grip is all that separates his dangling body from a long

Serge tumbles by Marshall, limbs flailing, and with a scream

Woven from a thousand nightma5, he loses his grip and slides

off the ramp into the jetblack sky, falling endlessly.

Shepherd and Caldwell manage to hang to safety webbing as

the

wind whips around them. The two other air force crew members

Without chutes also manage to hang on.

As the plane depressurizes, it BUCKS like a wild bronco.

Marshall looks down into the sky. Below his dangling legs,

parachutes blossoij. He's straining... he can't hold on

forever.

INT. COCKPIT -

Gibbs fights the wheel.

Oxygen masks spring out from an overhead compartment as air

is sucked out of the cockpit...

The plane shudders and jumps badly....

KC-135 PILOT (V.0. RADIO)

Air Force One, back off. I repeat, back off.

Gibbs wrestles with the yoke, to no avail.

KC-135 PILOT (V.0. RADIO)

What are you doing? Back off! Back off!

EXT. SKY -

Air Force One jerks upward, snapping off the fueling arm of

the KC-135.

The broken edge of the fueling arm scrapes along the top of

Air Force One... metal against metal... tearing a gash in

the plane... Sparks fly.

ONE OF THE SPARKS

ignites the river of gasoline being pumped from the refueling

craft's belly.

INT. AIR FORCE ONE, COCKPIT -

Gibbs Sees the fueling arm catch fire. It doesn't take a

rocket scientist to figure what's coming. The flames creep

up toward the gas tanks.

EXT. SKY -

Air Force One descends.

Whipping fire trails the KC-135.

Slowly rolls it way into the plane's main tank.

A burning fuse.

BARRROOOOOOOM! A FIRECLOUD ERUPTS ACROSS THE SKY.

Sky like daylight.

From this incredible firecloud, the burned out skeleton of

an airplane emerges, falling toward earth.

The F-15 escort zoom toward the unexpected fireball.

Carlton's planes go into emergency climb, standing on their

afterburners to escape the inferno.

INT. EMERGENCY PARACHUTE LAUNCH RAMP -

Marshall hangs on to the strut for dear life as the

pressurized air swooshes by him, taking with it everything

that isn't nailed down including some of the spare parachutes.

Fire rains down from the heavens, the sky like one giant

napalm nightmare.

The shock wave hits the plane, slamming it violently.

Almost yanking the hyraulic arm from Marshall's grasp.

The military aides without parachutes lose their footing and

tumble off the platform. SCREAMING as they fall into fire.

EXT. SKY -

The burning KC-135 shell, an apocalyptic Flying Dutchman in

a vengeful Kamikazee dive at Air Force One.

It's gonna be close.

The flaming shell passes only a few hundred yards to the

rear of the 747.

EXT. PARACHUTE LAUNCH RAMP -

Marshall's got a great view. Flames dance in his eyes as he

watches the refueling plane descend.

The brightness subsides, and the sky grows dark again.

The wave of pressurized air subsides leaving Zedeck, Marshall,

Shepherd and Caldwell on the ramp. Caldwell begins edging

toward Marshall.

Marshall barely hangs on.

Zedeck motions to Caidwell with his gun. "Go get him."

Caldwell crawls down the ramp and extends his hand to

Marshall.

THE PRESSURE DOOR SLAMMING SHUT -

zedeck leads Marshall, shepherd and Caldwell away.

IPRR. AFO'S FLIGHT DECK -

Chandler crosses to General Northwood, who has just hung up

the phone.

INT. AFO, MISSION COMMUNICATION CENTER - NIGHT

Zedeck leads the three hostage into the M.C.C.

Rose and Marshall - their eyes meet. Enormous relief for the

both of them. Marshall smiles at his wife, as she fights

back her tears.

President.

Zedeck grabs Caldwell's hands and tapes them behind his back

with duct tape. Rose and Alice already have their hands taped.

Gibbs!

INT. FLIGHT DECK -

Gibbs puts the plane on automatic pilot. Rises to join the

group.

INT. MISSION COMMUNICATIONS CENTER -

Korshunov separates Marshall from his family. Waves him into

the Com Officer's chair. His hands are now wrapped too.

Gibbs enters looking down.

I serve my commanding officers.

Korshunov holds up a telephone.

Gibbs grabs Alice and shoves her into a chair. She fights

him off, and he smacks her across the face and shoves his

gun into her neck.

Marshall and Rose struggle against their bonds.

Korshunov runs his finger down Alice's cheek.

Marshall looks to Alice, then Rose, then back to Alice.

Gibbs withdraws his pistol. Places it against Alice's temple.

Tears of fears are streaming down Alice's face. She looks

into her father's eyes.

Marshall struggles with his duty. His honor.

Marshall tries to look away, but Zedeck forces him to watch.

Alice's face, trying to be brave.

Rose looks away.

Alice looks at her father for the very last time. Then shuts

her eyes tight.

Gibbs begins to squeeze the trigger.

Korshunov smiles.

Gibbs withdraws the gun from Alice's temple. Alice opens her

eyes and gasps for breath.

You are true to your nature, Mr.

President.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

A sleepless Petrov paces back and forth, smoking a cigarette.

The phone RINGS. He looks up expectantly as his aide answers.

Petrov stops in mid-pace. Considers his cigarette for a moment

and then walks over to the phone.

INT. PRISON CELL - NIGHT

A guard walks down the cold steel hallway. He rattles the

bar of a darkened cage, he pulls out a set of keys and unlocks

the door.

Stravanavitch awakes, and leans forward into the light. He

and the guard trade looks. After a beat, the guard turns and

retreats down the the hallway.

Stravanavitch rises from his bunk and approaches the cell

door. He leans against it and it swings open.

INT. M.C.C. - NIGHT

Rose stares at Marshall. Her look is hard to read. Distant...

cold, perhaps.

Korshunov considers the pair. Hands taped behind their back.

They're harmless. Korshunov nods.

Marshall rises and joins her on the pilot's rest bunk.

Rose moves closer to him, and speaks in a low voice.

From behind, we see her push his taped hands away.

He looks at her quizically.

He feels the wall behind him. A dull edge of metal twisted

slightly from the earlier cockpit door explosion.

He understands.

She smiles back at him.

Behind Marshall's back, he begins to cut away at the duct

tape.

INT. MOSCOW CENTRAL PRISON, HALLWAY - NIGHT

Ivan Stravanavitch walks down the long prison hallway. Other

PRISONERS see him and begin banging on their bars in rhythm.

As he parades down the corridor, the banging grows until it

becomes deafening. Stravanavitch smiles a cocky smile.

One by one, guard doors swing open in front of him. In fact,

a few of the HACKS salute Stravanavitch as he passes.

INT. MISSION COMMUNICATION CENTER - AIR FORCE ONE

The communication board beeps and Zedeck picks up the line.

He exchanges some words with the caller in Russian, then

hangs up the phone.

Korshunov smiles and puts his hand on Zedeck's shoulder.

Marshall leans his head against the wall. Just as he expected.

Korshunov nods, motions Zedeck to take care of it. Zedeck

reluctanty descends to the main cabin.

President... all defeats are temporary and all victories are

temporary. Today' 5 conquerers are tomorrow's vanquished.

Zedeck arrives with a glass of water.

Zedeck brings the cup of water to Marshall's lips. Marshall

tips his head back to receive it.

Water spills over Marshall's face. He shakes it off.

With blinding speed, Marshall leaps to his feet and swings

his arm around Zedeck's throat. He snaps Zedeck's neck with

quiet efficency.

Gibbs fires at Marshall, but Marshall, using Zedeck as a

shield, grabs hold of the terrorist'sMP5 and lets loose...

mowing down the former Secret Service agent.

The rest of Gibb's shots pelt against the cockpit controls

sending showers of sparks flying.

Korshunov whips out his gun and lines up a clean shot at

Marshall's head.

Korshunov fires at Marshall, but...

Major Caidwell dives in front of the bullet spray taking the

rounds in his chest.

Marshall turns his aim to Korshunov... but Korshunov grabs

Alice and presses his pistol to her head.

Stand-off.

Marshall holds Korshunov in his sights. Slowly advancing.

President. And I love my country.

It's a fair trade.

Korshunov backs away to the steps. Marshall does not lower

his gun. Korshunov disappears down the staircase.

Shepherd stands. Marshall unwraps Shepherd's hands.

Marshall slowly descends the steps to the main cabin. As

soon as Shepherd gets her hands loose, Rose rushes to

Caidwell's aid. Shepherd crosses to the communications panel

and picks up a headset. Begins dialing numbers

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

In his nightdress, Stoli Petrov nurses a vodka on ice. His

PHONE RINGS.

Petrov's eyes widen.

EXT. MOSCOW PRISON EXERCISE YARD - NIGHT

A wall of bars part and Stravanavitch walks through. Into

the main exercise yard.

The main gate separates him from...

A group of men wait in the street by a limousine.

The main gate opens slowly.

When the men sees Stravanavitch they come to attention and

salute him. Stravanavitch returns the salute. And then starts

his march toward his limousine...

A SIREN WAILS. LIGHTS FLOOD THE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF THE

PRISON.

The front gate begins to close. Worry crosses Stravanavitch's

face. His men rush toward him, take position by the gate.

Stravanavitch breaks into a run toward his limousine.

Stravanvitch looks behind him. Guards rushing toward him

from the yard... the limousine fifty yards ahead of him...

closing fast...

On the limo... the back door open and waiting.

A shot rings out from the guard tower, followed by another,

and another. Like popcorn starting to pop. Stravanavitch's

men return fire. A minor war breaks out. Loyal guards battling

Stravanavitch sympathizers.

Stravanavitch caught in the middle, hit by one bullet, then

another, then another. He makesit to the open rear door of

the limousine, but collapses dead.

Everyone stops firing. Stravanavitch's men rush to his side..

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Petrov slips under the covers as an aide knocks on his door.

A beat.

Petrov turns out his bedside light.

Marshall makes his way through the dimness. Stepping

cautiously.

A shot rings out and richochets off a piece of piping right

over Marshall's head.

Undaunted Marshall advances.

He listens, footsteps ahead of him.

ON Korshunov - holding Alice by her hair, practically dragging

her over the mid-section wing cross-braces.

As Marshall appears in the gangway he fires off another shot,

hitting a cooling vent. Steam fills the' gangway area, bathed

in red auxiliary lighting.

Korshunov retreats toward the rear of the plane.

Korshunov fires and Marshall dives out of the way. He cones

up in defensive crouch ready to shoot, but all he can see is

INT. AIR FORCE ONE, LOWER AFT GALLEY - NIGHT

Marshall swings into the cubicle... empty.

He crosses to the cargo bay/parachute launch ramp hatchway.

Looks through the porthole.

Korshunov straps on one of the few remaining parachutes. He

tosses the rest of the spares out onto the platform.

Marshall steps onto the platform. Korshunov fires off a round

forcing him behind the door for cover.

Korshunov pulls Alice in front of him and yanks down the

ramp activation lever.

The ramp lowers, and Alice gets her first look at the drop.

Marshall watches the remaining parachutes slide off the ramp

and into the stormy sky.

Korshunov backs toward the edge of the ramp, pulling a

struggling and fighting Alice.

Korshunov is a foot away from the edge of the ramp... two

steps back, he and Alice will take the plunge.

Marshall lines up his shot. Korshunov laughs as he presses

his pistol to Alice's ear.

Marshall fires, his bullet ripping apart a good deal of

Korshunov's face and snapping his body back.

Korshunov tumbles off the platform, but his limbs are caught.

in Alice's. She's knocked to her belly and his dead weight

drags her off the edge of the platform.

Marshall dives down the sloping platform, reaching out for

her...

Alice tries to grip the platform with her hands, but she

can't hold on. Her hand slip off the metallic lip.

But as she falls, she's caught by the wrist. Strong arms

pull her up. Her father's arms. He carries her back to the

safety of the plane. She's sobs uncontrollably.

Shepherd and Rose appear. Marshall locks eyes with Rose...

smiles. Shepherd crosses to the parachute bins.

The plane shakes with the thunder of a supersonic boom.
