INT. HOTEL ROOM

Austin comes in and shuts the balcony door.

A VANESSA DOUBLE crosses carrying a bouquet of flowers, which

obscure her face.

Vanessa sits at the vanity with her back turned.

As Vanessa turns around she puts her hands up and PULLS OFF

HER FACE revealing wires, transistors, and a speaker where

her mouth should be.

They fight. Midway through the fight, machine guns pop out

of Vanessa's breasts.

Her machine gun breasts FIRE, spraying the room in SLO-MO.

Then they run out of ammo and CLICK, CLICK.

Austin empties his gun into the robot, but to no avail. She

rushes at him, he gives her a judo chop, also to no avail.

Then Austin' notices a SELF-DESTRUCT switch and hits it.

She starts to twitch, her head spins, and she EXPLODES.

Fembot parts fly around the room. Austin sits on the bed,

saddened. He holds Vanessa's hand, which has wires hanging

out of it. On one of the fingers is her wedding ring.

MUSIC: VERY SAD PIANO

INT. LOBBY - HOTEL

Rich European guests mill about the luxurious lobby. Suddenly,

Austin dances through naked. Just as we are about to see his

bits and pieces, a man lifts up his suitcase.

SEQUENCE CREDIT

MUSIC: Soul Bassanova by QUINCY JONES PAN UP Austin's NAKED

body as he walks down a boardwalk. Just as the camera reaches

that most sensitive of areas, a credit appears STARRING MIKE

MYERS. Austin gives a big 'who me?' and we

FREEZE FRAME.

EXT. BOARDWALK - FRENCH RIVERA

European types stare and point. We see Austin from behind.

His bottom half is blocked by a bicycle. The bicycle moves

away. Just as Austin's bum is about to be revealed-

A CREDIT APPEARS blocking it. Austin turns his head around

to the camera and puts his hand to his mouth in an 'oh my!'

take and we FREEZE FRAME.

A MAN IN A RAINCOAT flashes Austin, his thingy blocked by a

credit. Austin just laughs...crazy, man!

Austin goes around a corner. A moment later he returns,

followed by a NUDE MARCHING BAND.

A SIGN on the left side of the screen reads "Warning! Nude

Beach". Austin enters from the left.

We see his naked, hairy torso from the waist up. Just as he

is about to appear from behind the sign, a...

CREDIT APPEARS MOVING LEFT TO RIGHT Blocking his penis

lengthwise as he walks.

NUDE BEACH - CREDIT SEQUENCE

A girl sits on a blanket; a HORIZONTAL CREDIT blocks her

bare chest. Austin lays on his back beside her, trying to be

suave; A VERTICAL CREDIT appears.

The wind blows away a kite, revealing a stark-naked girl.

The credit "PRODUCTION DESIGN" blocks her chest; the credit

"BY" blocks her you-know-what. Austin walks into frame; the

"PRODUCTION DESIGNER'S NAME" disguises his growing interest.

Austin joins a nude volleyball game in progress. CREDITS

appear everywhere to block all possible combinations of

nudity. People leap in all directions to make saves, causing

CREDITS TO APPEAR at crazy angles.

A pretty girl watches Austin lift weights. Her boobs are

blocked by the "WRITTEN BY" credit.

Austin lifts a dumbbell. The credit "MIKE MYERS" sticks out

from his waist. Austin looks proud.

A BUFF NAKED BODYBUILDER joins them. He lifts a much heavier

weight. A much longer credit sticks out from his waist: "AND

MICHAEL MCCULLERS". Austin pouts.

Austin runs down the beach, his bum blocked by the credit

"DIRECTED BY". He jumps on a trampoline and does the splits

in mid-air:

FREEZE FRAME AND PAN AROUND LIKE IN THE GAP "KHAKI SWING"

AD.  Austin smiles crazily, his penis blocked by "JAY ROACH."

Austin does a super-duper double flip into his JAGUAR.

CU on the chrome script on the grill: it reads "Shaguar"

where it would normally read "Jaguar".

The car speeds off.

FULL SCREEN TV JERRY SPRINGER SHOW

On the stage we see a Klansman father and his Klansman son,

a Nazi father and his Nazi son, and SCOTT EVIL all seated on

a panel.

Lower Third Chyron: "MY FATHER IS EVIL AND WANTS TO TAKE

OVER THE WORLD"  JERRY SPRINGER

If you just joined us, today's topic is "my father is evil

and wants to take over the world". Now, Bobby, you had

something you wanted to share with your father before the

break.

The crowd WHOOPS.

The crowd goes crazy.

The Klansman holds his hooded head in his hands.

A handsome Blair Underwood look-alike enters and hugs the

Klansman's son. The crowd screams.

JERRY MOVES TO SCOTT EVIL.

Dr Evil enters.

Lower Third Chyron: "WANTS TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD"

Everyone is a little grossed out.

The Springer audience is stunned, slack-jawed and for once

quiet.

Studio audience whoops at this.

Crowd goes crazy.

Dr. Evil charges at Klansman and starts to bitch slap him.

Security men, with headsets on, rush in to separate them.

There is a BEAT, then Dr. Evil CHARGES the guy again, knocking

him down.

EXT. WORLD HEADQUARTERS BUILDING - DAY

We pan up a modern office building. The camera reaches the

top of the building and we see a giant STARBUCKS LOGO and

the words: Starbucks World Headquarters.

INT. STARBUCKS BOARD ROOM

The penthouse boardroom is adorned with Starbucks

paraphernalia: large logo, clear canisters full of beans,

and a large world map with a little logo everywhere there is

a Starbucks.

Around a large table are Dr. Evil, Number Two (bandaged and

lightly spotted with soot), Frau, Scott and a couple of NEW

HENCHMEN. A Starbucks employee serves everyone steaming hot

coffee products.

Dr. Evil takes a sip of cappuccino, leaving a WHITE FROTHY

MILK MUSTACHE on his upper lip.

FLASHBACK (FOOTAGE FROM FIRST MOVIE)

Number Two disappears backwards into the fiery pit.

INT. STARBUCKS WORLD HEADQUARTERS

Number Two smiles weakly, breaking into a sweat on his brow.

We see Frau. She looks a little more 'masculine' than before.

We see a severe-looking German woman with one continuous

eyebrow.

Dr. Evil takes another sip of cappuccino, making the frothy

milk mustache even larger.

We see a swarthy Greek army guy.

Dr Evil begins to press a button labelled "Oedipus" on his

control panel, but Number Two interrupts.

MUSIC: dramatic sting We see the shadow of an approaching

figure. The shadow looks like Dr. Evil, only much larger and

scarier.

We see that the source of the shadow is a MINIATURE DR. EVIL,

just like the creepy mini-Marlon Brando in The Island of Dr.

Moreau. He mimics Dr. Evil's mannerisms including holding

his tiny pinky to his tiny mouth.

Mini-Me sits down in a miniature version of Dr. Evil's command

chair.

The bald Mr. Bigglesworth runs and jumps into Dr. Evil's

lap. A bald MR. BIGGLESWORTH KITTEN jumps into Mini-Me's

lap.

DRAMATIC STING, SNAP ZOOM TO DR. EVIL.

Dr. Evil gloats. So does Mini-Me.

Number Two nods.

Mini-Me hops upon the table and tries to push the "Scott

Evil" button on Dr. Evil's control panel.

Frau SQUIRTS him with a water bottle. Mini-Me glares at Scott

and GIVES HIM THE FINGER.

A wall panel opens to reveal a Stargate-like wall of

shimmering energy.

First, I take Austin Powers' mojo. Then I begin my domination

of the world.

Dr. Evil walks to the portal. Mini-Me follows, imitating him

perfectly. They enter the portal.

There is a FREEZE FRAME effect and they FADE AWAY, like in

Star Trek.

INT. DR. EVIL'S VOLCANO LAIR -

Dr. Evil and Mini-Me emerge on the other side of the portal

into a NEW LAIR. It is a large hollowed-out volcano room

dominated by chrome conduits and tasteful art pieces. A

younger Frau sits with NUMBER TWO, now played by ROB LOWE in

an eye-patch.

As Dr. Evil walks to the center of the room, chairs rise

from the floor. Everyone takes a seat, but Dr. Evil gets

caught in the middle as chairs rise around him. He is

frightened. One of the rising chairs hits him in the crotch.

Mini-me says nothing.

Mini-me still says nothing.

Dr. Evil goes over and looks out the large window.

EXT. DR. EVIL'S TROPICAL ISLAND -

We cut outside to see that window is in fact the left eye of

a Mt. Rushmore-type depiction of Dr. Evil carved into the

side of a volcano on a tropical island.

INT. MOD - CRYOGENIC FREEZING ROOM -

We see Austin's FROZEN BODY in cryogenic storage. Above it,

we see two digital clocks. One reads:

CURRENT DATE: MAY 25, 1969, the other reads: DATE FROZEN:

NOVEMBER 11, 1967. One of the SCOTS GUARDS, is an IMMENSELY

FAT SCOTTISH SOLDIER (played by Mike Myers).

They exchange salutes and the Colonel exits.

The Fat Soldier begins to play the BAGPIPES, a white vapor

comes out of them, filling the room.

The other soldiers COLLAPSE, unconscious.

He bores through the ice and pulls out a Sixties high-tech

syringe type device with an LED graph on the side. He places

it in Austin's navel. The LED meter goes from red to green,

indicating FULL MOJO.

EXT./INT. AUSTIN'S SHAGUAR - DRIVING - DAY

Austin drives in MODERN TRAFFIC. He is drinking a STARBUCKS

COFFEE and listening to the Jag's in-dash CD PLAYER. Suddenly

Austin DROOPS. The car starts to sputter. The fuel gauge

reads empty.

Austin hits a button on the dashboard.

BASIL EXPOSITION appears on the picture phone in the dash.

INT. SKI LODGE

Austin sets up his photo equipment. The room is decorated in

classic Heffner- bear skin rugs, leather chairs, roaring

fire.

REG, the photo assistant, enters.

The models make their entrance. They are REAL SUPERMODELS,

say CINDY CRAWFORD, REBECCA ROMAJIN and also one MODEL we

don't know.

Austin shoots a look to Reg like 'still got it, baby.'

Austin comes to the unknown model. She is tall and angular.

Austin looks over the girls, trying to decide who is the

spy.

Austin begins snapping pictures. The sequence is shot like a

photo shoot, with freeze frames, etc.

Cindy gets on all fours.

FULL FRAME, cover of Vogue. Cindy with her head framed out.

Rebecca looks confused.

FULL FRAME, Rebecca on the cover of National--Geographic.

Austin throws his camera to Reg, who catches it.

Reg shows the girls out as they PROTEST. Austin and Ivana

are left alone. Austin CLAPS TWICE and the lights dim. He

CLAPS again and the fire goes up.

MUSIC: I'm Never Going To Fall in Love Again by BURT BACHARACH

Ivana moves over to a chessboard set up nearby.

Ivana starts playing with the chess pieces sexily (like in

The Thomas Crowne Affair).

She runs the bishop across her lips sexily.

Austin tries to match her sexy moves and CHOKES on a piece.

Austin rolls around on the polar bear rug.

She pulls his shirt off, revealing his prodigious chest hair.

Austin takes the head of the bear skin rug.

We pan around the room, seeing all the stuffed and mounted

wildlife who seem to be watching. Suddenly the camera stops.

So does the music.

MONTAGE - VARIOUS STOCK FOOTAGE

A tall flower wilts and beds over. A souffle falls. A flag

is lowered to half mast. A giant redwood falls in a forest.

Austin is being loaded into one of those big scary MRI

machines: the MOJONATOR 9000. The mojo meter reads VERY LOW.

INT. MOD LAB

MONTAGE (TIME-LAPSE): Technicians in white suits and masks

transform the room into a love lair: A pair of Latex-gloved

hands carefully puts a BURT BACHARACH record on a turntable.

Examination lights are replaced with LAVA LAMPS. A tray is

brought in with a videotape marked "SWEDISH EDUCATIONAL FILM."

Finally, the transformation is complete. Austin lies in bed

reading a vintage PLAYBOY. A CANDY STRIPE NURSE enters, very

pretty, in a tight outfit.

An ALARM goes off. Bright LIGHTS come on. Basil enters.

Basil shows Austin the mojometer, which reads EMPTY.

INT. MOD - TIME-TRAVEL ROOM

Austin and Basil ride on the back of a golf cart through the

largest room you've ever seen in your life.

Basil shows Austin altered photos of Dr. Evil with famous

villains, such as Sadam, Nixon, and Donald Trump.

Austin tries to read them and gets queasy.

Austin burps and swallows it.

A bright overhead light comes on spotlighting a brand new

VOLKSWAGEN BEETLE CONVERTIBLE, painted up psychedelic by

Peter Max.

Austin gets into the car and turns it on.

Austin steps on the gas. The car lurches in reverse and

smashes some equipment.

The car takes off, heading for the wall. It DISAPPEARS,

leaving flaming tread marks.

FLASH CUT TO:

EXT. STREET - LONDON -

The Beetle time machine appears out of nowhere and screeches

to a stop. A London HIPPIE smoking a hukka watches. He throws

the hukka down. Austin hops out.

Austin smiles and we see that his teeth are back to being

TERRIBLE. He walks off as a crowd gathers around the car.

EXT. PARK - LONDON

Austin enters the park in high spirits. We PULL BACK to see

that Austin is being watched through binoculars by a big

ARYAN ASSASSIN.

PULL BACK FURTHER to reveal a beautiful MYSTERIOUS WOMAN

watching both of them. From this distance we can't tell who

she is.

A sign reads "BE-IN FOR PEACE". HIPPIES, MODS, and FREAKS of

all descriptions dance to the music of a PSYCHEDELIC BAND.

The band's name is on the drum kit: "MING TEA."

Austin gets into the dancing, quickly becoming the center of

the scene. The lead singer of the band invites him on stage

and hands him the microphone as the band starts a new song:

"SEXUAL REVOLUTION."

Austin begins singing and a choreographed musical number

begins involving the outdoor crowd a la Bob Fosse's Sweet

Charity or Hair.

Hip-thrusting young MOD FREAKS Fosse-hump rhythmically.

Austin does various groovy dance moves like THE ROCK 'EM

SOCK 'EM ROBOT and THE HEAVYWEIGHT.

Forty Austins appear in a KALEIDOSCOPE EFFECT.

Three GROOVY CHICKS behind Austin suddenly have tambourines

for the big finale. The assassin and the mysterious woman

are both in the audience, keeping an eye on Austin. All we

see of the woman are shots of her BOOTS, CLOTHES, and a FEMALE

SYMBOL MEDALLION.

Austin holds the note an improbably long time, arms

outstretched.

The dancers crouch-walk towards the camera.

The SONG ENDS and all the dancers end up on one knee with

their arms outstretched, panting. Austin breathes heavily

and smiles smugly like Michael Flatley, Lord of the Dance.

We are TIGHT ON Austin's ass. PULL BACK to see that it is

the MYSTERIOUS WOMAN who is watching Austin's ass. She SMILES

behind the binoculars hiding her face.

37 EXT. CARNABY ST.

Austin walks down the street looking at his new BEATLES ALBUM.

Sitting in a parked Citroen watching him is the ASSASSIN.

The Aryan assassin nods to a SHOE-SHINE on the street.

The shoe-shine boy nods to a BUSINESS MAN in a Homburg.

The business man nods to a BOBBY.

The bobby nods to a WOMAN WITH A BABY CARRIAGE.

The woman with a baby carriage nods to a MIME.

The mime nods to a BLIND BEGGAR with a tin cup.

The blind beggar nods to a CARPENTER on a roof.

The carpenter FLASHES A LIGHT to an INDIAN CHIEF.

The Indian Chief gives a SMOKE SIGNAL to a TELEGRAPH OPERATOR.

The telegraph operator sends a signal to the BEEFEATER GUARD.

The Beefeater salutes with his pike to a SEXY TICKET COLLECTOR

on a double-decker bus.

The sexy ticket collector signals a TAXI DRIVER.

The taxi driver nods back to the assassin as he drives by.

INT. CITROEN

The assassin gets the signal and starts the car. The whole

nodding sequence was a circular waste of time.

EXT. STREET - VARIOUS ANGLES

Austin walks along. Suddenly, he sees the Citroen coming at

him.  He dives out of the way and takes off running. He rounds

a corner and pretends to be a COUPLE MAKING OUT against a

wall by hugging himself.

The assassin sees him and slams on the brakes. He raises his

gun.

Austin turns as he hears a car HONK.

It's Austin's BEETLE CONVERTIBLE. The mysterious woman steps

out.

We see her in her entirety for the first time, and what a

sight it is. She has long auburn hair and wears a tight racing

suit, unzipped just enough to show the female symbol

medallion.

She is FELICITY SHAGWELL.

MUSIC: FELICITY'S THEME

Austin dives in as the assassin FIRES. The car speeds off.

INT. BEETLE (REAR PROJECTION)

Felicity drives expertly.

EXT. ROAD

The Beetle zips along, and then-- the Citroen appears behind

it.

The assassin FIRES.

INT. BEETLE

Felicity turns around to look.

Austin grabs the wheel and Felicity pulls a gun. She turns

and FIRES out the window.

EXT. ROAD

The assassin's tire BLOWS. The car skids towards a Cliff and

he jumps out as it goes over.

EXT. CLIFF SEEN FROM THE OCEAN

The car goes over and tumbles down the cliff, bouncing three

times before it EXPLODES.

The assassin hangs on to a branch with one hand. He falls.

EXT. CLIFF SEEN FROM THE OCEAN

Same shot as the car: The assassin's body goes over and

tumbles down the cliff, bouncing three times before it, too,

EXPLODES.

She smiles, turns, and walks away.

INT. AUSTIN'S PAD

The room is dark, with only a single spotlight providing

illumination. Suddenly, Austin and Felicity rise on an

elevator into the middle of the spotlight.

Light floods the pad, revealing hanging basket chairs, Hi-

fi, and Warhol silk screens of Austin.

Austin blows DUST off a table.

Austin hits a button and a bookcase revolves to reveal a

wetbar.

Austin walks seductively over to the real wetbar and hits a

button. It revolves to reveal a bookcase.

Austin hits a button and an automatic coffee-pourer pours a

cup.

MUSIC: Girl from Impenema by JOBIM

Austin hits a button and a series of actions take place: the

floor opens up to reveal a sunken bed; red gels slide into

place over the lamps; a painting slides back to reveal a

reel-to-reel; an end table revolves to reveal a selection of

massage oils.

Felicity lies on her stomach. Austin begins to massage her.

They laugh. Austin continues to massage her.

She reaches behind her and unties the strap of her evening

dress, revealing her naked back.

Austin GULPS and accidentally spurts way too much oil on

her.

Austin continues the back rub and Felicity stretches out on

the bed.

Austin takes a peak-- nothing. He is panicked.

She moves close to Austin. He slides to the other side of

the bed.

She moves over to him. He avoids her.

Austin holds up toothpaste and toothbrush. Felicity finally

grabs him and pins him to the bed.

Austin sits up.

Austin and Felicity drive against obvious rear screen

projection of India.

It looks like a mosque, with incense, tapestries, and

DISCIPLES.  Austin and Felicity enter.

MUSIC: SITAR

We see the GURU PITKA (played by Mike), an Indian man in a

bright red sari.

The Guru walks to the front of the room and the disciples

sink to their knees.

The guru holds up a card which says "NOWHERE = NOW HERE!"

Guru holds up a card which says "ASSUME = ASS - U - ME."

Guru holds up a card that says "NOT TINKER, NOT TAUGHTS, BUT

THE GAP" with the familiar Gap font.

The Guru takes a swig of Yoo-Hoo.

The disciples file out. Austin and Felicity approach.

INT. DR.EVIL'S VOLCANO LAIR

Dr. Evil and Frau are interrupted by the man we now know as

FAT BASTARD. He is foul-mouthed, and when he swears he is

bleeped.

Dr. Evil PRIVATE ARMY SOLDIERS drive in a forklift loaded

with gold bars.

Fat Bastard slowly draws out the high-tech syringe full of

MOJO.

Dr. Evil is mesmerized.

Mini-Me runs and snatches the mojo from Fat Bastard and gives

it to Dr. Evil, who caresses it and places it on a SPECIALLY

PREPARED PEDESTAL.

NUMBER TWO enters.

Suddenly, Scott Evil enters through TIME PORTAL.

Scott, very hurt, sits back in his chair and sulks. Dr. Evil

hits a button and a model moon and a model earth descend.

Dr. Evil looks around and sees Mini-Me gnawing on the model

laser. Dr. Evil takes it from his mouth

Scott SNICKERS.

Scott SNICKERS again.

INSERT SHOT:

A giant laser beam smashes down through the roof of the White

House, causing it to explode.

Everyone is shocked by the laser's power.

Take care of it.

INT. AUSTIN'S PAD - NIGHT

A party, packed with dancing freaks of every stripe, is in

full swing. A girl dances in an oversized birdcage.

The party sequence is shot like Laugh-In. Very fast cuts to

the music.

Austin sees a VERY PREGNANT WOMAN drinking a martini and

smoking.  He gently lifts her drink and cigarette away from

her.

Another angle. Austin and Felicity dancing.

We see RICARDO MONTEBLAN -smoking a hukka on a round chair.

Felicity slaps Austin on the butt as he walks off.

Austin at the bar with an exotic-looking mod chick.

An Alan Zeus-type very gay guy.

A LONDON COP and Felicity are on hanging chairs.

A GUY IN A RAINCOAT on a tricycle, shot undercranked, rides

through the party and falls over.

The camera pans up Felicity's cool hip-huggers, which are

very tight.

Austin does a spit take.

Felicity with a VIKING.

Austin is wearing a silly spiked German helmet like in Hogan's

Heroes.

Film running backwards of Austin doing a spit take.

ARTIE JOHNSON in German helmet behind a plant.

Austin takes his glasses off to clean them. We see his POV,

which is totally fuzzy. He looks over and sees what appears

to be a NUDE GIRL- two round globes and dark triangle.

Austin puts his glasses on and looks again. It is actually a

girl in a flesh-colored dress. In between her and Austin

were two COMPLETELY BALD MEN and a triangular martini glass

filled with a Cosmopolitan.

Cut to Austin and Felicity together again.

She points to where Fat Bastard and his companion are

standing.

Fat Bastard exits.

Felicity follows Fat Bastard out the door. Austin makes his

way over to the girl.

She extends her hand. Austin takes it and shakes. As he

shakes, her cleavage undulates like jello. Austin is

transfixed and keeps shaking far too long.

Austin. is shaking her hand so vigorously that she is in

danger of popping out of her dress.

Austin is grossed out.

Austin does another smug take. Robin grabs Austin and pulls

him close.

ALAN ZEUS-TYPE GUY IN LIMBO

EXT. FISH AND CHIPS STAND - NIGHT

Literally a window in a wall. Fat Bastard is placing his

order.

We pan to see Felicity beside him.

Felicity swallows hard and forces a smile.

INT. AUSTIN'S PAD - NIGHT

Beat.

Robin moves Austin into place as they dance.

Just then, Austin looks into her eyes and sees the REFLECTION

OF AN ASSASSIN (Oedipus) about to throw a knife.

Just as he throws it, Austin spins Robin Swallows around and

USES HER AS A SHIELD. She takes the knife squarely in the

back.

Oedipus pulls out a pistol and begins FIRING. Austin continues

to use Robin AS A SHIELD. She takes six hits. Oedipus runs

out of bullets.

Oedipus pulls out a machine gun and FIRES. In a Robert

Rodriquez- like flurry of events, Austin dodges while still

USING HER AS A SHIELD.

Oedipus throws down his gun and charges Austin. Austin uses

Robin's body to block Oedipus's head butt, but his momentum

pushes all three of them through a PLATE GLASS WINDOW of his

second story loft.

IN MID-AIR

As they fall, Austin turns Robin around so that she is between

him and the ground.

EXT. OUTSIDE AUSTINIS FLAT

They land with a THUD. Robin cushions Austin's fall. Oedipus

is dead on the pavement.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Felicity is in bed, naked under the sheets, smoking a

cigarette.  We hear strange sounds offstage.

We pan over to reveal she's IN BED WITH A NAKED FAT BASTARD!

He is eating a huge turkey leg, his face covered in food.

He rolls over to reveal his HUGE NAKED ASS.

Felicity takes a homing device out of her purse, looks around

for a place to plant it. She sees his enormous butt cleavage

and realizes that there's only one place for the thing to

go.

ANGLE on FAT BASTARD'S face. He is delighted.

She is horrified.

INT. DR. EVIL'S VOLCANO LAIR - MAIN ROOM

Dr. Evil at his table with Frau, Scott, and Number Two.

The PRESIDENT appears on Dr. Evil's video screen with his

SNAP ZOOM:

Dr. Evil looks around smugly. No one laughs.

SNAP ZOOM:

He looks around again, expectantly.

The President and his advisors MURMUR.

Dr. Evil signs off.

Scott looks at him with disgust.

Everyone leaves and he walks over to a panel bearing his

logo. He presses a button, the panel opens up to reveal... A

SECRET SHRINE TO AUSTIN POWERS!

In it we see a huge full-length photo of Austin Powers, and

various magazine covers.

He presses a button and an Austin wig descends from the

ceiling landing perfectly on his bald head. A backless mockup

of Austin's suit rises from the floor. He puts on a pair of

glasses. He has become Austin Powers.

Dr. Evil cautiously tastes the mojo.

We PUSH IN towards Dr. Evil's head.

FLASH CUT TO:

DR. EVIL ANIMATED SEQUENCE

A Yellow Submarine-like depiction of Dr. Evil. Zoom in on

his head which explodes into 30 other small Dr. Evil heads

which rain on a Peter Max-ian valley of flowers. The flowers

sprout the word "EVIL'.

A psychedelic flying Austin head with spirals in the glasses

smashes the flowers, changing the words from "EVIL" to "VILE"

and to "LIVE" and then to "LOVE".

Turn-of-the-century fat cat capitalists on stilts with teeth

coming out of their stomachs drop penis rockets that have

the word "GREED" written on the shaft, smashing the "LOVE"

flowers into "IRELO" which sprouts into "YELLOW" which turns

into submarines, which becomes yellow penises of huge, goose-

stepping Dr. Evils, each of them peeing, creating a rain of

urine that falls on the Peter Max-ian valley of a hundred

Austin Powers citizens. They each open an umbrella that says

"LOVE TRIUMPHS OVER LUST". The urine turns into a stream

that flows into the mouth of a huge head of Dr. Evil.

FLASH CUT BACK TO:

INT. DR. EVIL'S VOLCANO LAIR - AUSTIN SHRINE

Pull back from Dr. Evil's head. He looks dazed and confused.

Just then, Number Two re-enters the room, catching Dr. Evil

with all his Austin paraphernalia.

EXT./INT. CARNABY STREET - DAY

Austin and Felicity walk along the street.

Suddenly Austin notices something outside and puts his hand

to his mouth in fear.

Felicity is immediately on her guard. She pulls her gun.

Austin turns his hand around to show her. He has written 'oh

my God' on his hand with the pen.

They laugh.

Austin and Felicity duck into a CAMERA SHOP and come out an

instant later with SUPER-8 CAMERAS.

They run down the street filming each other.

AUSTIN AND FELICITY - SUPER-8 MONTAGE

This is a Richard Lester-like sequence shot on grainy film

from Austin and Felicity's POVs.

There's lots of SPEEDED UP stuff and POPPING IN AND OUT of

frame like the MONKEES TV show.

BACK ON THE STREET

Austin is impressed.

Austin starts to say something, then bites his tongue.

Austin and Felicity stop at an ICE CREAM MAN with his

pushcart.

We cut back to the ICE CREAM MAN to see him pulling off a

very fake beard. It is BASIL (though it was clearly another

actor before).

Basil hands Felicity a tracking device that BEEPS.

Austin and Basil are confused and grossed out at the same

time.

INT. BEETLE

We hear the BEEP-BEEP of the tracking screen built into the

dash.

Just then a-car pulls beside them. Two Dr. Evil Private Army

guys pull machine guns and start SHOOTING.

Felicity ducks. Austin reaches back and pulls ROBIN SWALLOWS

from the back seat and USES HER AS A SHIELD.

EXT. DR. EVIL'S ISLANDNIGHT

We hear the BEEP-BEEP of the tracking screen.

EXT. BEACH - DR. EVIL'S ISLAND - NIGHT

The Beetle comes from under the water and lands on the beach.

We still hear the BEEP-BEEP.

EXT. TENT - WOODS - NIGHT

Austin and Felicity have set up a tent with a view of the

Dr.  Evil Mt. Rushmore face. Austin is looking at the mountain

through a pair of binoculars which hang around his neck.

Austin hands her the binoculars. Unfortunately the strap is

still around his neck, pulling his face into her cleavage.

He and Felicity enter the tent. A LIGHT is on inside casting

shadows of Austin and Felicity on the side of the tent. From

the outside it appears the shadow Austin is leaning over

with his back to-the shadow Felicity, who appears to have

her hands up his butt.

The shadow Felicity appears to be tugging a string of sausage

links from his ass.

The shadow Felicity appears to pull a tennis racket out of

Austin's ass.

INT. TENT

We see that Austin is leaned over holding part of the tent.

Felicity is rummaging through a duffel bag across the tent.

INT. DR. EVIL'S VOLCANO LAIR

We see Dr. Evil playing a piano. We pan to see Mini-Me on

top of the piano, himself playing a miniature baby grand.

We see that Number Two and Frau are the audience. They

applaud.

MUSIC: It's Rainina Men by THE WEATHERGIRLS Three HE-BOTS

enter in unison. They are robotic studs in Logan's Run type

outfits.

ANGLE ON THE FIRST HE-BOT.

A nozzle flips up from his codpiece and white smoke pours

out.

ANGLE ON THE SECOND HE-BOT.

A gun barrel flips out form his crotch and FIRES machine-gun

style.

ANGLE ON THE THIRD HE-BOT.

A nozzle flips up from his crotch and yellow liquid drizzles

out onto the floor, where it smokes.

Dr. Evil is disgusted by the last one.

EXT. TENT

We see the shadows again. It now looks like Felicity is

putting things into Austin's ass.

The shadow Felicity tries to cram the tennis racket into

what appears to be Austin's ass.

Pull back to reveal that THE HE-BOTS are watching. Felicity

shoves the tennis racket extra hard.

Austin stands up rapidly.

The He-Bots shrug their shoulders and march towards the tent.

INT. DR. EVIL'S VOLCANO LAIR - 60'S

Dr. Evil, Fat Bastard, Scott, Number Two and Frau are seated.

Austin and Felicity are brought in at gunpoint by Private

Army Men.

Austin trails off as he spots his MOJO in the beaker behind

Dr.  Evil.

Felicity kicks Dr. Evil in the balls.

The guards lead Austin and Felicity away.

The area around Dr. Evil's command chair, including the time

portal behind it, is enclosed by a circular door, becoming

part of the rocket. Steam begins billowing, etc.

Austin and Felicity are in a bare cell with cement walls.

The huge metal door has a window with bars in it.

Felicity is touched.

They kiss.

Felicity charges towards the window in the door, ripping

open her blouse as she goes, showing her breasts to the guard.

We, however, can't see them.

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE CELL

The guard is mesmerized by Felicity.

He unlocks the door and enters.

INT. JAIL CELL

The guard enters an apparently empty cell. We see that Austin

is wedged spread-eagle above the door, ready to pounce.

The guard follows her into the cell.

The guard advances on her.

She PUNCHES the guard right in the face and he collapses.

Austin falls flat on his face with a THUMP and pops back up.

INT. DR. EVIL'S MOON BASE

It is a stark, steel girder and glass structure. Dr. Evil is

trying to look dignified but he is FLOATING AWAY. He grabs

at the railing of his chair as his feet float up.

ANGLE ON THE TOP OF THE ROOM.

Mini-Me is stuck to the top of the ceiling along with a lot

of DEBRIS.

A couple of henchmen place BOOTS on Dr. Evil. He drops to

the floor.

He's interrupted by terrible FEEDBACK. Dr. Evil taps and

blows on the mic.

Worse FEEDBACK. He holds it farther away.

The laser's coils begin to glow RED.

FULL FRAME - LUNAR TRACKING MODEL

A NORAD-type screen showing the current position of the moon

and where it needs to be before the laser can fire.

INT. DR. EVIL'S VOLCANO LAIR - MAIN ROOM

Austin and Felicity run into the Main Room. It is strangely

dark and quiet.

MUSIC: It's Raining Men by THE WEATHERGIRLS Suddenly, the

lights dim. The three He-Bots descend from the ceiling on

trapezes and acrobatic rings, their muscles rippling.

The He-Bots flip off their trapezes and land in unison, like

a perfect Olympic dismount. Their crotch nozzles flip up one

by one.

MUSIC: seductive music Felicity does a very seductive dance,

with hip thrusts and bumps and grinds. The He-Bots EXPLODE,

succumbing to her mojo.

Austin and Felicity turn to see Fat Bastard lurking in the

background.

Fat Bastard, holds the beaker and is flanked by a dozen

private army men.

Guards approach.

Austin is grossed out.

Fat Bastard hands over the mojo.

surrounded by hundreds of gauges, buttons and meters.

A technician closes the hatch and the countdown begins.

EXT. CAPE CANAVERAL (STOCK FOOTAGE)

The rocket lifts off.

INT. APOLLO CAPSULE

The G-forces during lift-off are incredible. Austin's face

is pulled into a contorted mask which bares his teeth. His

hair sticks straight up and his glasses are twisted.

Austin is terrified. He clutches Felicity's hand, then grabs

on to the astronaut beside him.

Felicity, however, loves it.

EXT. SPACE - APOLLO ROCKET (STOCK FOOTAGE)

The stages separate.

INT. DR. EVIL'S MOON BASE

Dr. Evil walks all the way around a TUBULAR HALLWAY-- up the

walls, across the ceiling upside down, and back again,

settling into his chair. It is like that shot in 2001 SPACE

ODYSSEY.

The laser shifts into place. An ALARM goes off and LIGHTS

FLASH.

THE SCREEN FLICKERS ON:

The ALARM continues to blare.

INT. OVAL OFFICE (SPLIT SCREEN)

The President at his desk.

The ALARM BLARES.

The ALARM BLARES.

The ALARM SHUTS OFF but Dr. Evil is still shouting.

His yelling startles even himself.

INT. NASA CONTROL ROOM

A white room with a bank of old-fashioned computers and a

tracking screen. Basil, several GENERALS, and other VIPs

look anxiously over the shoulder of the MISSION CONTROL

SPECIALISTS.

INT. DR. EVIL'S MOON BASE - HALLWAY

Austin and Felicity enter through a hatch and step out of

their spacesuits.

Suddenly, Austin notices something.

He points. We see a profile through a sheet of frosted glass.

It is Dr. Evil's distinctive profile, with a machine gun.

Austin takes careful aim and FIRES.  We see the SHADOW take

the hit, and fall.

Felicity runs ahead. Austin runs over to where the shadow

came from. He sees that it was not Dr. Evil, but MINI-ME,

carrying a little gun. Austin is ashamed.

Austin chokes back a tear.

Austin runs after her.

INT. DR. EVIL'S MOON BASE - MAIN ROOM

Austin rounds the corner and comes upon Dr. Evil.

A wall panel in the main chamber revolves, revealing FELICITY,

enclosed in a glass tube.

Brightly colored GAS starts to fill the glass chamber.

Austin is torn. He looks back and forth between Felicity and

the laser which is on the other side of the room.

The woman manning the laser's joystick begins to MOVE IT.

Austin leaps across the room and reaches her just in time.

He wrestles with her a moment and then KNOCKS IT ASKEW.

EXT. SPACE

The laser beam hits the Big Boy Rocket in the crotch and Big

Boy's eyes cross in pain.

INT. DR. EVIL'S MOON BASE - MAIN ROOM

Dr. Evil hits a SELF-DESTRUCT button. An ALARM blares.

The base is rocked by EXPLOSIONS.

Austin looks over. Felicity has slumped over in the tube.

Austin BANGS on the glass with his fists.

It is too late. Dr. Evil runs through the TIME PORTAL and

gets away.

Austin looks up to the heavens. We see a quick--

FLASHBACK - MONTAGE

of moments they shared, Austin making her laugh, their first

kiss, of Felicity being her beautiful and free-spirited self.

A tear runs down his cheek. Austin presses his face against

the glass as if trying to reach her.

Austin starts to chase him, but THREE PRIVATE ARMY MEN block

his path. Austin is like an animal.

He charges toward the first soldier, RIPS HIS HEART OUT, and

takes a bite out of it.

Then Austin turns to the second soldier and RIPS HIS SPINE

OUT like in Mortal Kombat. The soldier slumps to the ground.

The last soldier is terrified. Austin swings both fists

simultaneously, crushing the guy's head which EXPLODES LIKE

A PUMPKIN.

Austin runs over to the TIME PORTAL set for "75 BC". He runs

through.

INT. ROMAN VILLA - 75 BC

An orgy is taking place. Dr. Evil is in a toga with a laurel

with two YOUNG ROMAN MEN feeding him grapes.

He runs away as Austin appears through the TIME PORTAL. Austin

follows Dr. Evil into another TIME PORTAL marked "1975".

EXT. VENTURA BOULEVARD -

Austin emerges from the TIME PORTAL to see Dr. Evil getting

into a car. Austin waves his hands and a 1974 RED FORD TORINO

with a white stripe pulls over.

We see PAUL MICHAEL GLASER (STARSKY).

Austin jumps in and the Torino speeds off. Dr. Evil's car

disappears into a car wash which is a TIME PORTAL. The Torino

follows.

A sign at the car wash reads: "1911"

EXT. DECK OF THE TITANIC -

Passengers in period garb walk past a lifesaver with "Titanic"

stenciled above it. Dr. Evil enters through a portal with

Austin hot on his heels.

Suddenly the ship tilts at a radical angle. LEONARDO DICAPRIO,

KATE WINSLET, and JAMES CAMERON slide by.

Dr. Evil and Austin slide backwards into the TIME PORTAL

they just came from.

EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY -

Dr. Evil runs into the street with Austin chasing him. In

SLO-MO Austin dives for a ridiculously long time, and TACKLES

Dr.  Evil, pinning him.

MUSIC: DRAMATIC STING

Austin looks over and sees a TIME PORTAL. Through it he can

glimpse the lair, and Felicity.

Austin runs through.

INT. DR. EVIL'S MOON BASE - 60'S

We see the scene from a moment ago. Felicity is in the glass

tube and the BRIGHTLY COLORED GAS is starting to fill it.

Austin runs over to the glass tube and SMASHES HIS FIST

through it. The glass SHATTERS and Austin pulls Felicity

out. She gasps for air.

Austin kisses her for a long time. She starts to twitch.

She struggles. She hits him in the head and he finally stops

kissing her.

Austin turns and gives a 'who me?' look over his bottom. The

woman arming the laser stumbles backwards into the directional

control just as it FIRES.

EXT. SPACE

The Big Boy Rocket spins to avoid the laser as it passes

harmlessly by.

INT. NASA CONTROL ROOM

Jubilation.

Austin stumbles. Felicity looks at him.

The TIME PORTAL is fifty feet away. Austin and Felicity run

towards it. In the foreground, are a stack of conveniently

placed barrels. As they run behind the barrels, an obvious

AUSTIN STUNT DOUBLE and an obvious FELICITY STUNT DOUBLE

emerge in their place.

The stunt doubles grab a winch hanging above them and cross

over to the TIME PORTAL in a dramatic series of acrobatic

flips and stunts.

The stunt doubles run behind another conveniently placed

pile of barrels. Austin and Felicity emerge in their place

and run through the TIME PORTAL. The TIME PORTAL reads "1999".

FADE TO BLACK:

INT. AUSTIN'S PAD - 1999 - DAY

It is the most up-to-date modern apartment you've ever seen

in your life. There is a large screen TV, a DVD player etc.

Movers move in tasteful modern furniture and various other

accouterments of moving. Felicity puts a CD on an old style

turntable.

SFX: SCREEEECH!!

Felicity smiles broadly, revealing that she now has TERRIBLE

TEETH like Austin's.

They kiss.

FADE TO BLACK.
