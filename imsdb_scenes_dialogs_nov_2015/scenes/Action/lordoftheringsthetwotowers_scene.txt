Elvish dialogue from The Elvish Linguistic

Fellowship.

[Camera pans over the Misty Mountains

as voices drift in from the background.]

You cannot pass!

Gandalf!

I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder

of the Flame of Anor!

[Camera pans closer to the mountain

side.]

Argh! Go back to the shadow. The Dark

Fire will not avail you, Flame of Udun!

[Camera zooms in through the mountain

and focuses on Gandalf and the Balrog

on the bridge of Khazad-dum. The Balrog

strikes down on Gandalf with its flaming

sword. Gandalf parries the blow with

Glamdring, shattering the Balrogs sword.]

YOU... SHALL NOT... PASS!!!

[Gandalf strikes his staff onto the

bridge. As the Balrog steps forward,

the bridge collapses from under it and

the demon plunges backward into the

chasm. Gandalf, exhausted, leans on

his staff and watches the Balrog fall

then turns to follow the others. At

the last minute, the flaming whip lashes

up from the depths of the abyss and

winds around Gandalfs ankle, dragging

him over the edge. He clings onto the

bridge but is straining to keep his

grip.]

Argh!

[Frodo rushes forward but Boromir restrains

him.]

No! No!

Gandalf!

Fly, you fools!

[Gandalf loses his grip and falls into

the chasm]

Noooooooooooooooo!!!!

[Gandalf loses his grip and falls into

the chasm]

[Calls after Gandalf as he falls into

the abyss] Gaaandaaaaalf!!

[Gandalf falls after the Balrog and

grabs hold of his sword Glamdring on

his way down. As they continue to plunge

into the depths, Gandalf hacks away

at the Balrog even as it thrashes and

bounces off the walls. They continue

to plunge at great speed, sometimes

with Gandalf clinging to the horn of

the demon. The battling pair then falls

into an enormous cavern and plunges

into the water. Just then Frodo awakens

as if from a nightmare.]

Gandalf!

What is it, Mr. Frodo?

Nothing. Just a dream. [Lies back down.]

[Frodo and Sam climbs over the rocky

terrain Emyn Muil. They look into the

distance at the Mountain of Fire.]

Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth

we dont want to see any closer, and

the one place were trying to get to.

Its just where we cant get. Lets

face it, Mr. Frodo, were lost. I dont

think Gandalf meant for us to come this

way.

He didnt mean for a lot of things to

happen, Sam... but they did.

[Suddenly Frodo feels and sees the Eye

zooming in on him. He gasps and pants

as he backs away.]

Mr. Frodo? Its the Ring, isnt it?

Its getting heavier. [Clutches the

Ring by his chest and sits down, still

panting. He then fumbles for his water

bottle and takes a sip.]

What food have we got left?

Well, let me see. [He takes out a package

of lembas bread from his pack] Oh yes,

lovely  Lembas bread. And look! [He

digs deeper into his pack] More lembas

bread.

[Sam shows another package. He then

breaks off a piece and tosses it to

Frodo, and munches on a piece himself.]

I don't usually hold with foreign food,

but this Elvish stuff, its not bad.

[smiles] Nothing ever dampens your spirits,

does it Sam?

[Sam smiles back, and then looks ominously

towards Mordor.]

Those rain clouds might.

[They continue trekking through difficult

terrain, often huddling underneath their

cloaks.]

[Looks around] This looks strangely

familiar.

[Exasperated] Its because weve been

here before! Were going in circles.

Ah! What's that 'orrid stink? I'll warrant

there's a nasty bog nearby. Can you

smell it?

Yes. I can smell it. [Drops to a whisper]

Were not alone.

Frodo and Sam are sleeping. A dark shape

appears on top of the cliff. The creature

Gollum has appeared and is making his

way down to the hobbits.]

The thieves! The thieves! The filthy

little thieves! Where is it? Where isss

it? They stole it from us. My preciousss.

[Gollum creeps closer and closer.] Curse

them! We hates them! Its ours, it is...

and we wantssss it!

[Gollum reaches out his hand towards

the hobbits. Suddenly the hobbits spring

up, grab hold of Gollums arms and pull

him down. Amidst the struggle, Gollum

wriggles loose and leaps onto Frodo.

As Frodo falls back, the chain and Ring

around his neck is revealed and Gollum

jumps straight for the Ring. Sam tries

to grab at him but is knocked away.

Gollum now jumps on top of Frodo and

tries to reach for the Ring even as

Frodo grabs his hands and tries to push

him away. Gollums cheeks puff with

exertion as he struggles with Frodo,

his enormous eyes fixed on the Ring.

Sam grabs hold of Gollum again and tears

him away from Frodo. Gollum then turns

around and bites Sam on the shoulder,

wriggles around and clasps his arms

around Sams neck and legs around his

waist in a death grip. Frodo unsheathes

Sting and holds it to Gollum's throat.]

[menacingly] This is Sting. Youve seen

it before, havent you... Gollum! Release

him or Ill cut your throat!

[Slowly, Gollum loosens his grip on

Sam and as the latter disentangles himself,

Gollum wails. In the next scene, Gollum

is being dragged with Sam's Elvish rope

around his neck, wailing and writhing

in pain.]

It burns! It burns us! It freezes! Nasty

Elves twisted it. Take it off us!

Quiet you!

[Sam tugs fiercely at the rope. Gollum

cries some more and collapses onto his

back. Sam turns to Frodo in dismay.]

Its hopeless! Every Orc in Mordors

going to hear this racket! Lets just

tie him up and leave him.

No! That would kill us! Kill us!

Its no more than you deserve!

Maybe he does deserve to die, but now

that I see him, I do pity him.

[Begging] We be nice to them if they

be nice to us. Take it off us. We swears

to do what you wants. We swears.

Theres no promise you can make that

I can trust.

We swears to serve the master of the

preciousss. We swears on... on the precious.

*Gollum. Gollum.*

The Ring is treacherous. It will hold

you to your word.

Yes... on the preciousss. On the preciousss.

I dont believe you! [Gollum backs away,

frightened, and climbs onto a boulder]

Get down! I said, down!

[Sam jerks strongly at the rope as Gollum

tries to get away from him. He crashes

onto the ground, choking.]

Sam!

Hes trying to trick us! We let him

go hell throttle us in our sleep!

[Gollum lies panting and holding his

throat. He backs away, frightened, as

Frodo approaches him.]

You know the way to Mordor?

[nods warily] Yes...

Youve been there before?

[nods again] Yes...

[Frodo reaches out and takes the rope

noose off Gollums neck. Gollum seems

surprised and relieved.]

You will lead us to the Black Gate.

[Gollum scrambles off in the direction

of Morannon and the hobbits follow in

his wake.]

[A band of Uruk-hai marches across the

plain, with two hobbits bound to the

backs of two Uruk-hai. Pippin tries

to call to Merry, who is unconscious

with a gash on his right brow.]

Merry. Merry! [He receives no response.]

[Suddenly, an Uruk-hai puts up his hand

and signals a stop.]

What is it? What do you smell?

[sniffs the air] Man-flesh.

[quietly to himself] Aragorn!

They've picked up our trail! Let's move!

[The Uruk-hai quicken their pace. Pippin

struggles to reach his Elven brooch

with his teeth. He then tears it off

his cloak and drops it onto the ground.

A foot stomps onto the brooch but it

remains unbroken and visible on the

grass.]

[Aragorn is lying with his eyes closed

and ear pressed to the ground, listening

for the sound of footsteps.]

Their pace has quickened. [He looks

up.] They must have caught our scent.

Hurry! [He runs off.]

Come on, Gimli! [Looks back at Gimli

and then runs after Aragorn]

[pauses in his steps and huffs] Three

days and nights pursuit. No food.

No rest. And no sign of our quarry but

what bare rock can tell. [Runs after

his companions.]

[The Three Hunters run across rocks

and plains, with Aragorn in the lead,

followed by Legolas and Gimli. From

time to time, Legolas looks back to

make sure that Gimli is keeping up.

Aragorn suddenly bends down to pick

up an Elven brooch from the ground.]

Not idly do the leaves of Lorien fall.

[stops and turns to Aragorn.] They may

yet be alive.

Less than a day ahead of us. Come! [Runs

off again]

[Gimli stumbles from behind some rocks

and rolls to the ground]

Come, Gimli! We are gaining on them!

[Panting] I am wasted on cross-country!

We dwarves are natural sprinters! Very

dangerous over short distances!

[The trackers come over a hill and pause

as they gaze across the plains below.]

Rohan. Home of the horse-lords. There

is something strange at work here. Some

evil gives speed to these creatures,

sets its will against us.

[Legolas runs ahead and looks out to

the horizon.]

Legolas, what do your Elf eyes see?

The Uruks turn northeast. Theyre taking

the hobbits to Isengard!

Saruman.

[The tower of Orthanc stands amidst

the smoking caverns of Isengard. Saruman

stands in his chamber, communicating

with the Dark Lord through the Palantir.]

The world is changing. [View changes

to the tower of Barad-dur, with its

huge Orc armies on a bridge.] Who now

has the strength to stand against the

armies of Isengard and Mordor? To stand

against the might of Sauron and Saruman

and the union of the two towers?

[Camera pans upwards along the height

of the tower of Barad-dur until the

flaming Eye is in view.]

Together, my lord Sauron, we shall rule

this Middle-earth.

[The trees around Isengard are being

ripped down, chopped up and used to

feed huge furnaces. The caverns of Isengard

glow with the fires of industry, sounds

of hammering fill the air and molten

iron is poured into casts to forge weapons.]

The old world will burn in the fires

of industry. The forests will fall.

A new order will rise. We will drive

the machine of war with the sword and

the spear and the iron fists of the

Orc. We have only to remove those who

oppose us.

[Saruman stands in the midst of a gathering

of Dunlanders.]

The horsemen took your land. They drove

your people into the hills to scratch

a living off rocks.

Murderers!

Take back the lands they stole from

you! Burn every village!

[Roars with approval] Argh!!

[They stomp off to destroy the villages

of Rohan as Saruman stands coldly still

among the stampede. A Rohan village

is in pandemonium as people try to escape

the on-coming pillage.]

It will begin in Rohan. Too long have

these peasants stood against you. But

no more.

[A woman with her hand on a horse calls

out to her children.]

Eothain! Eothain! You take your sister.

Youll go faster with just two.

[As Morwen puts her onto the horse in

front of her brother] Papa says Eothain

must not ride Garulf, he is too big

for him!

Listen to me. You must ride to Edoras

and raise the alarm. Do you understand

me?

Yes, Ma!

[starts to cry] I dont wanna leave!

I don't wanna go, Mama!

Freda, I will find you there.

[A woman screams]

Quickly!

[The children ride off.]

[Looks after them] Go child!

[Dunlanders and Uruk-hai enter the village,

burning everything in sights as the

Rohirrim scream and run in all directions.

Eothain and Freda weep as they look

back from a distance.]

Rohan, my lord, is ready to fall.

[A group of horsemen ride to Edoras.

Eomer is in the lead, carrying a gravely

wounded Theodred.]

[Eowyn runs hastily up the stairs to

the Golden Hall and enters a bedchamber.

She runs to the bed.]

Theodred!

[Theodred seems to hear her call but

is unable to respond. He has a bloody

gash on the side of his head. Eomer

nods to Eowyn in the direction of Theodreds

torso. Eowyn draws back the covers and

upon seeing Theodreds fatal wound,

her lips tighten and eyes close. She

looks up to catch Eomers eye.]

[Eomer and Eowyn are speaking to Theoden-king

who sits motionless on his throne, wizened,

and aged beyond his years.]

Your son is badly wounded, my lord.

He was ambushed by Orcs. If we dont

defend our country, Saruman will take

it by force.

That is a lie! [Appears from the shadows.]

Saruman the White has ever been our

friend and ally.

[mumbles feebly] Grima... Grima... [Grima

leans down close to the King.]My son...?

Grima...?

Orcs are roaming freely across our lands.

Unchecked. Unchallenged. Killing at

will. Orcs bearing the white hand of

Saruman. [He drops a helmet onto the

ground, which topples over to reveal

the white hand of Saruman.]

Why do you lay these troubles on an

already troubled mind. Can you not see?

Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent,

your war-mongering.

War-mongering?

[Eomer grabs Grima and pins him against

a pillar.]

How long is it since Saruman bought

you? What was the promised price, Grima?

When all the men are dead you will take

your share of the treasure?

[Grimas eyes flicks to right, watching

Eowyn as she walks by. Eowyn stops to

stare back for a moment before departing

form the hall. Eomer jerks Grima again

and clutches his hand around Grimas

jaw.]

Too long have you watched my sister,

too long have you haunted her steps.

[Grima's eyes look to the left and relax

as Eomer is suddenly pulled off Grima

by his thugs.]

You see much Eomer, Son of Eomund. Too

much. [The thugs punch Eomer n the stomach]

You are banished forthwith from the

kingdom of Rohan. Under pain of death!

[Being dragged away] Argh!!

[Uruk-hai and Orcs continue to march

across the plains with their hobbit

captives, with Aragorn, Legolas, and

Gimli hot on their pursuits.]

Keep breathing! Thats the key! Breathe!

Ho!

Theyve run as if the very whips of

their masters were behind them.

[They continue running over vast distances.

The Uruk-hai and Orcs halt at nightfall,

many panting with exertion.]

Were not going no further till weve

had a breather!

Get a fire going!

[As the Orcs and Uruk-hai take their

rest, Pippin crawls over towards Merry.]

Merry! Merry!

[opens his eyes] I think... we might

have made a mistake leaving the Shire,

Pippin.

[A group of Orcs chops down the trees

nearby for firewood. Low groans and

rumbles start to emerge from the forest.]

Whats making that noise?

[looks towards the forest] Its the

trees.

What?

Do you remember the Old Forest? On the

borders of Buckland? Folk used to say

that there was something in the water

that made the trees grow tall... and

come alive.

Alive?

Trees that could whisper. Talk to each

other. Even move.

I'm starving. We ain't 'ad nothin' but

maggoty bread for three stinkin' days!

Yeah. Why cant we have some meat? [His

eyes rest on the hobbits.] What about

them? Theyre fresh.

They are not for eating!

What about their legs? They don't need

those. Ooh... They look tasty!

[Shoves at the Orcs] Get back, scum!

[The other Orcs are getting restless.]

Carve them up!

[Moves towards the hobbits with his

blade drawn] Just a mouth full.

No!

[Pippin and Merry recoil in fright.

Ugluk jumps on the Orc and cuts off

his head, which bounces off the hobbit's

shoulders.]

Looks like meats back on the menu,

boys!!

[The Uruk-hai and Orcs cheer and started

tearing into the fresh meat, intestines

flying, taking their eyes off the hobbits

for a while.]

Pippin, lets go.

[Their hands still bound, the hobbits

try to crawl away. Suddenly a foot comes

down on Merry and Pippin is turned onto

his back.]

[Brandishing a blade in front of Pippins

face] Go on, call for help. Squeal!

No ones gonna save you now!

[Suddenly, a spear pierces the Orc's

back. Mayhem ensues as Riders of Rohan

burst out from their hiding places and

ambush the Orcs.]

Pippin! [Gestures for them to make their

escape.]

[The hobbits try to escape from the

pandemonium to the forest, dodging bodies

and stomping feet. Suddenly Pippin turns

onto his face and looks up to a pair

of thrashing hooves bearing down on

him.]

ARGH!!!

[The Three Hunters are still chasing

after the Uruk-hai. It is dawn.]

[Pauses and looks up] A red sun rises.

Blood has been spilled this night.

[Camera pans over the rock and plains,

alternating between the band of Uruk-hai

and the Three Hunters giving chase.

The trackers hear the sound of horses.

Aragorn and company hide behind some

boulders. A large group of horse-men

appears, galloping quickly with their

banners flying. Aragorn comes out of

hiding as they pass, followed by Legolas

and Gimli.]

Riders of Rohan, what news from the

Mark?

[At a signal from Eomer at the lead,

the riders make a quick turn and head

towards them, surrounding them in ever-tightening

circles. As they stop, they point their

long spears menacingly at them.]

What business does an Elf, a man and

a Dwarf have in the Riddermark? Speak

quickly!

Give me your name, Horsemaster, and

I shall give you mine.

[Eomer hands his staff to another rider,

and gets off his horse. Aragorn puts

a hand on Gimlis shoulder.]

I would cut off your head, Dwarf, if

it stood but a little higher from the

ground.

[Legolas, in a lightning fast move,

points an arrow at Eomer.]

You would die before your stroke fell!

[The riders all point their spears closer

at the travellers. After a tense moment,

Aragorn pushes down Legolas arm.]

I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn. This

is Gimli, son of Gloin and Legolas of

the Woodland realm. We are friends of

Rohan and of Theoden, your king.

Theoden no longer recognizes friend

from foe. [Takes off helmet] Not even

his own kin.

[The spears are withdrawn.]

Saruman has poisoned the mind of the

king and claimed lordship over these

lands. My company are those loyal to

Rohan. And for that, we are banished.

The White Wizard is cunning. He walks

here and there, they say, as an old

man, hooded and cloaked. And everywhere

his spies slip past our nets.

We are not spies. We track a party of

Uruk-hai westward across the plain.

Theyve taken two of our friends captive.

The Uruks are destroyed. We slaughtered

them during the night.

But there were two hobbits. Did you

see two hobbits with them?

They would be small  only children

to your eyes.

We left none alive. We piled the carcasses

and burned them. [Points to a smoking

pile in the distance.]

Dead?

[nods] I am sorry.

[Legolas puts a hand on Gimlis shoulder

in grief. Eomer turns and whistles.]

Hasufel! Arod! [Two horses move up.]

May these horses bear you to better

fortune than their former masters. Farewell.

[Eomer puts on his helmet and gets back

on his horse]

Look for your friends. But do not trust

to hope, it has forsaken these lands.

[To the riders] We ride north!

[Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli look on

as the Riders go off. They then ride

towards the burning carcasses. Gimli

starts to shift through the smoldering

pile, and pulls out a charred belt and

dagger sheath.]

Its one of their wee belts.

[with his head bowed and eyes closed]

Hiro ith... ab 'wanath... (May they find

peace in death)

[Kicks a helmet and yells] AAARRGGHH!!!

[He falls to his knees.]

We failed them.

[Aragorn looks to the side as some tracks

catch his attention.]

A hobbit lay here, and the other. [Flashback:

Pippin yells as he looks up at a pair

of thrashing hooves bearing down on

him. He rolls over, avoiding the hooves.]

They crawled.

Merry and Pippin crawl frantically away

from the battle.]

Their hands were bound. [Flashback:

Merry rubs his bonds furiously against

the sharp edge of a weapon.] Their bonds

were cut. [Aragorn holds up a broken

length of thick rope.]

They ran over here. They were followed.

Their hands freed, the hobbits run away

from the battle scene, dodging under

a horse and trying to stay out of harms

way. As they flee, Grishnakh grabs Pippin

by his belt and clings on.]

The belt!

[Pippin undoes his belt and Grishnakh

is left holding it.]

Run!

The tracks lead away from the battle...

[They break into a run and then stop]

into Fangorn Forest.

[The Three looks up into a dense and

dark forest]

Fangorn. What madness drove them in

there?

[Scene moves from the trackers into

the nighttime chase of Merry and Pippin.

The hobbits run into the Fangorn, seeking

to lose the pursuing Orc. They collapse

onto the ground, out of breath.]

Did we lose him? [Looks around] I think

we lost him.

[Suddenly, Grishnakh appears from behind

the trees, brandishing a blade.]

Im gonna rip out your filthy little

innards! Come here!

[Merry and Pippin run and hide behind

a tree.]

Trees! Climb a tree!

[Pippin and Merry quickly scramble up

a tree each.]

[Looks around and then sighs in relief.]

He's gone.

[Suddenly, Merry is pulled by his legs

and falls to the ground. Grishnakh leans

over him with his menacing blade. Merry

tries to kick him off but to no avail.]

Merry!

[Pippin looks down in horror but as

he turns his head, he spots a pair of

gleaming yellow eyes blinking in the

tree hes clinging to. The tree starts

to move and groan.]

Hooooo...

Argh!!

[Pippin loses his grip in fright and

grabs at the air futilely as he falls.

The tree catches him before he hits

the ground.]

Lets put a maggot-hole in your belly.

[Suddenly he senses something behind

him and as he looks up, the tree stomps

and squashes him onto the forest floor.]

Run, Merry!

[Merry tries to run away but is scooped

by the tree.]

[Looks at the creatures in his hands]

Little Orcs! Burarum...

Its talking, Merry. The tree is talking!

Tree?! I am no tree. I am an Ent. [Stomps

slowly through the forest.]

A treeherder! A shepherd of the forest.

Dont talk to it, Merry. Dont encourage

it.

Treebeard, some call me.

And whose side are you on?

Side? I am on nobodys side because

nobodys on my side, little Orc. Nobody

cares for the woods anymore.

Were not Orcs. Were Hobbits!

Hobbits? Never heard of a hobbit before.

Sounds like Orc mischief to me! [Tightens

his hold on the hobbits and squeezes

them. Merry and Pippin whimpers in pain]

They come with fire, they come with

axes. Gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking,

burning! Destroyers and usurpers, curse

them!

No, you dont understand. Were Hobbits...

Halflings! Shirefolk!

Maybe you are and maybe you arent.

The White Wizard will know.

The White Wizard?

Saruman.

[Treebeard drops them on the ground

and the hobbits look up at the White

Wizard.]

[Following Gollum, Frodo and Sam reach

the end of Emyn Muil and see that Mordor

is now closer.]

See, see, we have led you out! Hurry

hobbitses hurry. Very lucky we find

you.

[Gollum jumps on a rock. Frodo walks

past, Gollum shrinks as Sam draws near.]

Nice hobbit. [Leaps after Frodo, putting

a wide berth between him and Sam.]

[Sams foot slipped into muck.]

Whoa, its a bog! Hes led us into a

swamp!

A swamp, yes, yes. Come, master. We

will take you on safe paths through

the mist. Come, hobbits, come. We go

quickly.

[Gollum looks back and gestures for

the hobbits to follow.]

I found it, I did. The way through the

marshes. Orcs don't use it. Orcs don't

know it. They go round for miles and

miles. Come quickly. Swift and quick

as shadows we must be.

[The marsh lands stretch for miles and

miles as far as the eye can see. The

hobbits and Gollum appear as little

specks. As the three pick their way

gingerly though the marshes, they see

faces floating in the water, still,

rotting and pale, and flickering flames

on the swamps.]

There are dead things! Dead faces in

the water!

All dead. All rotten. Elves and men

and orcses. A great battle long ago.

[Turns to face the hobbits.] The Dead

Marshes. Yes, yes that is their name.

This way. Dont follow the lights.

[Sams foot slips again into the water.]

Ohh!

Careful now, or hobbits go down to join

the dead ones and light little candles

of their own.

[Frodo is drawn to one of the faces

in Elven armour. He stares at it intently,

until suddenly its eyes open and Frodo

falls face-down into the water.]

Frodo!

[Frodo is in the water and sees many

faces of the dead, no longer still but

screaming and grasping, their rotten

robes and hair flowing about their gruesome

faces. Their hands are reaching for

him. Suddenly he is grabbed from behind.

Frodo sputters and gasps for air as

Gollum pulls him out of the water.]

[Looks at Gollum in perplexed gratitude

and disbelief.] Gollum...

Dont follow the lights! [Crawls away]

[Runs to Frodos side.] Mr. Frodo! Are

you alright?

[Frodo lies panting, staring after Gollum]

Sam is asleep but Frodo is still awake.

He is holding the Ring in the palm of

his hand and stroking it, mesmerized.

Suddenly he hears Gollum.]

Sooo bright. Sooo beautiful. [Frodo

quickly puts the Ring back inside his

shirt. He looks up to see Gollum crouching

away from him, stroking the centre of

his palm] our preciousss...

What did you say?

Master should be resting. Master needs

to keep up his strength.

[Moves over and crouches in front of

Gollum] Who are you?

Mustnt ask us. Not its business. *Gollum,

Gollum*

Gandalf told me you were one of the

River Folk.

Cold be heart and hand and bone. Cold

be travellers far from home.

He said your life was a sad story.

They do not see what lies ahead, when

sun has failed and moon is dead.

You were not so very different from

a hobbit once, were you... Smeagol?

[Looks up slowly.] What did you call

me?

That was your name once, wasnt it?

A long time ago.

My name... My name... S... S...Smeagol...

[Suddenly, the piercing cries of the

Nazgul are heard overhead]

Argh!!

Black Riders!

Hide! Hide!

Argh!

[Suddenly Frodo feels the pain of the

Nazgul's sword piercing him and the

call of the Ring. Images of the Ringwraiths

come to him in flashes.]

Argh!!

Cmon Frodo! C'mon!

[Frodo continues to clutch at the Ring

on his chest, immobilized. Sam drags

Frodo across to hide beneath some bramble

bushes. The Nazgul appears, tightening

his hold on the reins. Camera then shows

him riding a Fell Beast, swooping down

across the marsh lands. Chilling screams

of the Nazgul fill the air.]

Quick! They will see us! They will see

us!

I thought they were dead!

Dead? No, you cannot kill them. No.

[A loud screech from the Nazgul flying

high above the marshes.]

[cowering] Wraiths! Wraiths on wings!

They are calling for it. They are calling

for the preciousss.

[Frodo feels the call of the Ring and

gropes for his necklace. Sam sees this

and grabs hold of Frodos hand.]

Mr. Frodo! Its alright. Im here.

[The Nazgul continues to circle overhead

and then flies off towards Mordor.]

Hurry, hobbits. The Black Gate is very

close.

[Scene returns to Fangorn forest. Gimli

fingers a dark stain on a leaf and brings

it to his mouth.]

[Spits] Ptui! Orc blood.

These are strange tracks.

The air is so close in here.

This forest is old. Very old. Full of

memory... and anger.

[Groans reverberate through the forest

and Gimli raises his axe.]

The trees are speaking to each other.

[Whispers] Gimli!

Huh?

[Gestures] Lower your axe.

[Lowering his axe slowly] Oh.

Aragorn, nad na ennas! (Something is

out there.)

Man cenich? (What do you see?)

[Close-up of Legolas eyes]

The White Wizard approaches.

Do not let him speak. He will put a

spell on us.

[Aragorn wraps his hand around the hilt

of his sword, Gimli tightens his hold

on his axes, and Legolas notches an

arrow to his bow.]

We must be quick.

[With a yell, the three swing round

to attack. Gimlis axe and Legolas

arrow are deflected. Aragorn drops his

sword as it becomes red hot in his grasp.

They shield their eyes with their hands

from the bright light emanating from

the White Wizard.]

You are tracking the footsteps of two

young hobbits.

Where are they?

They passed this way the day before

yesterday. They met someone they did

not expect. Does that comfort you?

Who are you? Show yourself!

[The bright light dims, revealing Gandalf,

all dressed in white. The three are

astounded. Legolas and Gimli bow.]

It cannot be. You fell.

Through fire and water. [Flashback:

Gandalf is battling the Balrog atop

Durins Tower.] From the lowest dungeon

to the highest peak, I fought with the

Balrog of Morgoth.

[Gandalf holds up Glamdring and a flash

of lightning strikes it before he plunges

the sword into the Balrog. With a final

cry, the Balrog falls from the peak

and lands, smoking, onto the icy mountainside.]

Until at last, I threw down my enemy

and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.

[On top of the mountain, Gandalf crawls

a bit and then collapses.]

Darkness took me. And I strayed out

of thought and time. [Camera zooms in

Gandalfs eye and enters an amorphous

realm of stars and galaxies, ending

in a blinding white light] Stars wheeled

overhead and everyday was as long as

a life-age of the earth. But it was

not the end. I felt life in me again.

[Camera zooms out from Gandalfs eye,

lying naked and very still. His hair

has turned white and wounds are completely

healed. He suddenly shudders with a

deep gasp and pants as life returns

to him]

I've been sent back until my task is

done.

Gandalf!

Gandalf? Yes... That's what they used

to call me. Gandalf the Grey. That was

my name. [He smiles]

Gandalf!

[With a twinkle in his eye] I am Gandalf

the White. [Aragorn grins] And I come

back to you now at the turn of the tide.

[They walk through the forest, with

Gandalf leading the way, now wearing

a grey cloak over his white robes.]

One stage of your journey is over, another

begins. War has come to Rohan. We must

ride to Edoras with all speed.

[Outside the forest, Gandalf whistles

piercingly. Soon an answering neigh

is heard and a white horse appears from

the plain, answering the call.]

That is one of the Mearas, unless my

eyes are cheated by some spell.

[The horse comes round to stop in front

of Gandalf.]

Shadowfax. [Gimli bows in the background.]

He's the lord of all horses and he's

been my friend through many dangers.

[The Three Hunters and Gandalf ride

across the plains to Edoras.]

[Back at Fangorn, Treebeard is walking

through the forest with Merry and Pippin

sitting on his shoulders.]

My home lies deep in the forest near

the roots of the mountain. I told Gandalf

I would keep you safe and safe is where

Ill keep you. The trees have grown

wild and dangerous. Anger festers in

their hearts. They will harm you if

they can. There are too few of us now.

Too few of us Ents left to manage them.

[Frodo and Sam are climbing a high rock

overlooking Morannon.]

The Black Gate of Mordor.

[The enormous Black Gate comes into

view with Orcs patrolling and standing

guard on the towers and atop the walls.

From the right, an army of Easterling

soldiers is marching to the Black Gate.]

Oh save us. My ol' Gaffer'd have a thing

or two to say if he could see us now.

Master says to show him the way into

Mordor, so good Smeagol does. Master

says so.

I did.

[Orcs are patrolling the Black Gate.]

Thats it then. We cannot get past that.

[A command is heard and an Orc sounds

a horn, signalling for the Gate to be

opened. Two enormous cave trolls stretch

and growl and then pull the mighty Gate

open.]

Look! The gate, it's opening! I can

see a way down.

[He moves closer to the edge. Suddenly,

the rock underneath him gives way and

he falls.]

Sam, no!

Argh!!

[Frodo goes after Sam.]

Master!

[Two Easterling soldiers see streams

of dust coming down the cliff made by

Sam and Frodo. They move away from the

troop to investigate. Frodo reaches

Sam who is stuck in the scree. As the

Easterlings move closer and closer,

Frodo throws his Elvish cloak over himself

and Sam. The soldiers are now directly

in front of Sam, but their eyes see

nothing but rock. Frodo and Sam peer

from underneath the cloak. The soldiers

soon leave and after a moment, Frodo

throws back the cloak and pulls Sam

out.]

I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.

I know, Mr Frodo. I doubt even these

Elvish cloaks will hide us in there.

[They prepare to make a run for the

Gate.]

Now!

[Gollum pulls them back.]

No! No, no master! They catch you! They

catch you! Dont take it to him! He

wants the preciousss. Always hes looking

for it! And the preciousss is wanting

to go back to him. But we mustnt let

him have it.

[Frodo tries to make a run for it.]

No! [Pulls Frodo back again.] Theres

another way. More secret. A dark way.

Why havent you spoken of this before?!

Because Master did not ask!

Hes up to something.

Are you saying theres another way into

Mordor?

Yes. There is a path, and some stairs,

and then... a tunnel.

closes. Gollum is stroking Frodos arm

and burying his face in his cloak.]

Hes led us this far, Sam.

Mr. Frodo, no.

Hes been true to his word.

[Whispers] No!

Lead the way, Smeagol.

Good Smeagol always helps.

[Frodo follows Gollum as Sam stares

after him in disbelief.]

[On the plains of Rohan. Gandalf, Aragorn,

Legolas and Gimli stop as Edoras comes

into view.]

Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld.

There dwells Theoden, King of Rohan,

whose mind is overthrown. Sarumans

hold over King Theoden is now very strong.

[In the Hall, Eowyn is kneeling before

Theoden, holding his hand in hers.]

My lord, your son, he is dead. My lord?

Uncle?

[Theoden just sits and stares ahead,

his eyes clouded and unseeing.]

Will you not go to him? [She weeps.]

Will you do nothing?

[Scene returns to Gandalf and company.]

Be careful what you say. Do not look

for welcome here.

[They ride on towards Edoras.]

[At Edoras, Eowyn is weeping at the

dead Theodred's bed. She kisses his

hand. Grima appears at the door.]

Oh, he... he must have died sometime in

the night. What a tragedy for the king

to lose his only son and heir.

[He sits on the bed and puts a hand

on Eowyns shoulder.]

I understand his passing is hard to

accept, especially now that your brother

has deserted you.

[jumps back and throws off Grimas hand]

Leave me alone, snake!

[Rises from the bed and moves ever closer

to Eowyn] Oh, but you are alone! Who

knows what you have spoken to the darkness.

In bitter watches of the night, when

all your life seems to shrink, the walls

of your bower closing in about you,

like a hutch to trammel some wild thing

in.

[He puts a hand on her cheek and moves

down to her throat.]

So fair, so cold, like a morning of

pale spring still clinging to winter's

chill.

[Eowyn and Grima stare at each other

intently.]

Your words are poison!

[Eowyn runs out of the hall. Weeping,

she looks away into the distance. A

flag comes off its pole and is carried

by the breeze. Eowyn sees riders coming

towards Edoras. As Aragorn passes the

entrance to Edoras, the flag floats

down to land near him. Edoras is silent

and somber. Everyone is dressed in black

and staring at the newcomers in wary

silence. Aragorn looks up at the hall

and sees a lady in white standing on

the steps. He looks around at more somber

people.]

Youll find more cheer in a graveyard.

[Aragorn looks up to the hall again

but the lady has disappeared. The company

climbs up the stairs to the hall and

is met by guards.]

[sees Hama] Ah.

I cannot allow you before Theoden-King

so armed, Gandalf Greyhame. By order

of Grima Wormtongue.

[Gandalf nods in understanding and signals

for the others to surrender their weapons.

Aragon hands over his sword and knives.

Legolas gives a little twirl to his

knives before handing them over to the

guards. Gimli hands over his axes reluctantly.]

[gestures to Gandalf] Your staff.

Hmm? [Glances at his staff.] Oh. You

would not part an old man from his walking

stick? [Looks at Hama innocently.]

[Hama hesitates for a second and then

gestures that they follow him into the

hall. Gandalf gives Aragorn a tiny wink

and enters the hall, leaning on Legolas

arm.]

[Leaning down and whispering to Theoden.]

My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.

Hes a herald of woe.

The courtesy of your hall is somewhat

lessened of late, Theoden King.

[As Gandalf approaches Theoden, Aragorn,

Legolas and Gimli pull back and survey

the hall and its hostile occupants.

A group of men starts to follow their

steps with hostility.]

[Whispering to Theoden.] Hes not welcome.

Why should I... welcome you, Gandalf...

Stormcrow? [Looks to Grima for affirmation.]

A just question, my liege. [He walks

towards Gandalf.] Late is the hour in

which this conjurer chooses to appear.

Lathspell spell I name him. Ill news

is an ill guest.

Be silent! Keep your forked tongue behind

you teeth. I have not passed through

fire and death to bandy crooked words

with a witless worm! [Raises his staff

against Grima.]

His staff! [Backing away from Gandalf

while addressing the guards] I told

you to take the wizards staff!

[The hostile guards attack. Aragorn,

Legolas and Gimli engage them in a fist-fight

as Gandalf continues to approach Theoden.

Gamling tries to go forward but Hama

holds him back.]

Theoden, son of Thengel, too long have

you sat in the shadows.

[Grima tries to crawl away unnoticed,

but Gimli catches him and pins him to

the floor.]

[Growls] I would stay still, if I were

you.

Hearken to me! I release you from the

spell. [Gestures with his hand]

[Menacingly] Hahahhhahahahah! [Gandalf

opens his eyes in surprise.] You have

no power here, Gandalf the Grey!

[Gandalf throws back his grey cloak,

exuding blinding white light. Theoden

is thrown back against his seat.]

Argh!

[Points his staff towards Theoden.]

I will draw you, Saruman, as poison

is drawn from a wound.

[Eowyn rushes in. Seeing her uncle threatened,

she tries to go to him but is held back

by Aragorn.]

Wait.

[In Sarumans voice.] If I go. . . Theoden

dies.

[Gandalf moves his staff sharply and

Theoden flies back against the chair

again.]

You did not kill me, you will not kill

him!

[in Saruman's voice] Rohan is mine!

Be gone!!

[Gandalf smites Theoden as he lunges

at him. Theoden is thrown back into

the chair and the shot changes to Saruman

flying backwards from the Palantir which

he used to manipulate Theoden. He lands

landing hard on the floor of Orthanc,

bleeding from a gash in his forehead.

In the hall, Theoden lets out a moan

and slumps forward in the chair. Eowyn

runs to her uncles side as he falls.

Theodens head rises again and his face

begins to change gradually into that

of a much younger-looking man. Clarity

and recognition returns to his eyes.]

[Looks closely at Eowyn] I know your

face. Eowyn... Eowyn.

[Eowyn weeps with joy]

Gandalf?

Breathe the free air again, my friend.

[The hall is shown to be filled with

light again, as everyone marvels at

the rejuvenation of the king.]

[Standing up and looking around him.]

Dark have been my dreams of late. [He

looks down at his trembling hands.]

Your fingers would remember their old

strength better... if they grasped your

sword.

[Hama runs up with his sword. Theoden

reaches for it with trembling hands.

He wraps his fingers around it slowly

and then draws it, gazing upon the shiny

steel. In a corner, Grima trembles and

tries to escape but is pulled back by

Gimli. Suddenly, Theodens gaze turns

to Grima. Grima is thrown out of the

hall and down the stairs.]

Argh! [Beseechingly to Theoden] I've

only ever served you, my lord!

[Advancing towards Grima, holding the

sword firmly in his hand] Your leechcraft

would have had me crawling on all fours

like a beast!

[Grovelling] Send me not from your side.

[Theoden raises his sword to kill Grima.

Aragorn holds him back.]

No, my lord! No, my lord. Let him go.

Enough blood has been spilled on his

account.

[Grima scrambles to his feet and pushes

through the crowd]

Get out of my way!

Hail, Theoden king!

[The crowd kneels in homage before Theoden.

Aragorn kneels also. Grima rides out

of Edoras. As Theoden turns to go back

into the hall, he looks up.]

Where is Theodred? Where is my son?

[A white flower comes into view, held

up by a hand. It is released and spirals

down to land among similar flowers,

in front of a tomb.]

Simbelmyne. Ever has it grown on the

tombs of my forebearers. [Looks at Gandalf]

Now it shall cover the grave of my son.

Alas, that these evil days should be

mine. The young perish and the old linger.

That I should live to see the last days

of my house.

Theodreds death was not of your making.

No parent should have to bury their

child.

[Theoden starts to weep]

He was strong in life. His spirit will

find its way to the halls of your fathers.

Westu hal. Feru, Theodred, Feru. (Be-thou

well. Go-thou, Theodred, go-thou.)

[Gandalf turns to go back to the hall

and leaves Theoden to grieve in private.

He spots two children on horseback.

The boy collapses and falls off the

horse. Later, inside the Golden Hall,

the two children are eating at a table,

and Eowyn is with them.]

They had no warning. They were unarmed.

Now the wildmen are moving through the

Westfold, burning as they go. Rick,

cot and tree.

Wheres mama?

Shh...

This is but a taste of the terror that

Saruman will unleash. All the more potent

for he is driven now by fear of Sauron.

Ride out and meet him head on. Draw

him away from your women and children.

[Leans forward and puts a hand on Theodens

chair. Theoden looks at his hand warily.]

You must fight.

You have two thousand good men riding

north as we speak. Eomer is loyal to

you. His men will return and fight for

their king.

They will be three hundred leagues from

here by now. Eomer cannot help us. I

know what it is that you want of me.

But I will not bring further death to

my people. I will not risk open war.

[Gimli takes a bite of his bread as

he watches the exchange between Aragorn

and Theoden.]

Open war is upon you. Whether you would

risk it or not.

When last I looked, Theoden, not Aragorn,

was king of Rohan.

[Gimli takes a drink and burps.]

Then what is the kings decision?

[Scene shifts to outside Meduseld]

By order of the king, the city must

empty. We make for the refuge of Helms

Deep. Do not burden yourselves with

treasures. Take only what provisions

you need.

[People are moving about, gathering

their belongings and preparing to move.

Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli

walk towards the stables.]

Helms Deep! They flee to the mountains

when they should stand and fight. Who

will defend them if not their king.

Hes only doing what he thinks is best

for his people. Helms Deep has saved

them in the past.

[They enter the stables]

There is no way out of that ravine.

Theoden is walking into a trap. He thinks

hes leading them to safety. What they

will get is a massacre. Theoden has

a strong will but I fear for him. I

fear for the survival of Rohan. He will

need you before the end, Aragorn. The

people of Rohan will need you. The defences

HAVE to hold.

They will hold.

[Turns to Shadowfax and strokes him]

The Grey Pilgrim... thats what they

used to call me. Three hundred lives

of men Ive walked this earth and now

I have no time. With luck, my search

will not be in vain. Look to my coming

at first light on the fifth day. At

dawn, look to the East.

[Opens the stall gates] Go.

[Legolas jumps back as Gandalf rides

out of the stable and over the plains

of Rohan.]

[Eowyn opens a chest in which lies a

sword. She unsheathes it and begins

to practice. She swings around and is

met by Aragorn, who blocks her parry.]

You have some skill with a blade.

[With a swift move, Eowyn swings her

sword and renders Aragorn vulnerable,

gaining the upper hand.]

[Stepping back and sheathing her sword.]

Women of this country learned long ago:

Those without swords may still die upon

them. I fear neither death nor pain.

What do you fear, my lady?

A cage. To stay behind bars until use

and old age accept them and all chance

of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.

You are a daughter of kings, a shieldmaiden

of Rohan. [He sheaths his knife.] I

do not think that would be your fate.

[He bows and Eowyn gazes after him as

he walks away.]

[The people of Rohan are moving out

of Edoras towards Helms Deep, with

Theoden leading the way. At Isengard,

Grima confers with Saruman, holding

a cloth to his mouth.]

Theoden will not stay at Edoras. Its

vulnerable, he knows this. He will expect

an attack on the city. They will flee

to Helms Deep, the great fortress of

Rohan. It is a dangerous road to take

through the mountains. They will be

slow. They will have women and children

with them.

[Sarumans eyebrows rise in response.

He walks through the depths of Isengard

and gives orders to an Orc.]

Send out your warg riders.

[The Orc smiles. In a pit behind him,

ferocious growls are heard and shadows

dances.]

[Gollum is trying to catch a fish in

the river. He slips and falls, grasping

at a slippery fish as he goes. Frodo

and Sam follow behind.]

Hey Stinker! Dont go getting too far

ahead!

Why do you do that?

What?

Call him names; run him down all the

time.

Because... because that's what he is,

Mr. Frodo. There's naught left in 'im

but lies and deceit. It's the Ring he

wants. It's all he cares about.

[Glaring at Sam] You have no idea what

it did to him. What its still doing

to him. [He walks past Sam and stops.]

I want to help him, Sam...

Why?

Because I have to believe he can come

back.

You cant save him, Mr. Frodo.

[Snapping at Sam]What do you know about

it? Nothing!

[Sam walks away slowly.]

[With remorse] I'm sorry, Sam. I don't

know why I said that.

[Looks back at Frodo with tears in his

eyes.] I do. It's the Ring. You can't

take your eyes off it. I've seen you.

You're not eating. You barely sleep.

It's taken a hold of you, Mr Frodo.

You have to fight it!

[Grows angry again] I know what I have

to do Sam. The Ring was entrusted to

me! It's my task! Mine! My own! [He

walks away]

Cant you hear yourself? Dont you know

who you sound like?

[Frodo continues to walk away without

looking back.]

[Nighttime, Frodo and Sam are asleep.

Gollum is crouching in a corner by himself.]

We wants it. We needs it. Must have

the precioussss. They stole it from

us. Sneaky little hobbitsesss. Wicked,

trickssssy, falssse!

No! Not Master.

Yes, precious. False. They will cheat

you, hurt you, lie.

Masters my friend.

[Tauntingly] You dont have any friends.

Nobody likes YOU...

[Covers his ears] Not listening. Im

not listening.

Youre a liar and a thief.

[Shaking his head] Nope.

Mur...derer...!

[Starts to weep and whimper] Go away.

Go away! [Cackles] HAHAHAHA!!

[Weeping and in a small voice] I hate

you. I hate you!

[Fiercely] Where would you be without

me? *Gollum, gollum*. I saved us. It

was me. We survived because of me!

[Resolute] Not anymore.

[Startled] What did you say?

Master looks after us now. We dont

need you.

What?

Leave now and never come back.

No!!

[Louder] Leave now and never come back!

[Growls and bares his teeth] Arrrgh!!!

LEAVE. NOW. AND. NEVER. COME. BACK!

[Smeagol pants and then looks around.]

We... we told him to go away! And away

he goes, preciousss. [He hops around

in joy and does a little dance.] Gone,

gone, gone! Smeagol is free!

[The next day, while the hobbits were

resting, Smeagol comes back with two

rabbits and drops them onto Frodos

lap.]

Look! Look! See what Smeagol finds!

Hehehe! Hahaha!

[Frodo looks at up him with bloodshot

eyes. He smiles at Smeagol and looks

at Sam. Smeagol raises a fist in self-congratulation

and dances around. He then picks up

one of the rabbits and snaps the rabbit's

back in front of Frodo.]

They are young. They are tender. They

are nice. Yes they are! Eat them! Eat

them!

[He bites and tears into the raw meat.

Sam rushes over and snatches the rabbit

out of Gollums hands]

Youll make him sick, you will, behaving

like that! [Holding up the two rabbits]

Theres only one way to eat a brace

of coneys.

[A pot of stew is simmering over a fire.]

[Looking into the pot] Argh!! Whats

it doing! Stupid fat hobbit! It ruins

it!

Whats to ruin? Theres hardly any meat

on em.

[A faint calling sound catches the attention

of Frodo.]

What we need is a few good taters.

Whats taters, preciousss? Whats taters

uh?

PO-TAY-TOES! Boil em. Mash em. Stick

em in a stew. Lovely big golden chips

with a nice piece of fried fish....

[Sticks out his tongue in disgust] Pbbbttt!!

Even you couldnt say no to that. [He

takes a sip of the stew]

Oh yes we could! Spoil nice fish...

[scrambles up close to Sam] Give it

to usss rrraw... and wrrriggling! [Makes

sickeningly happy face.] You keep nasty

chips. [Hops away]

Youre hopeless.

[Frodo follows the source of the sound.

Sam suddenly notices that Frodo is no

longer in his sight.]

Mr. Frodo?

[He goes in search of Frodo and finds

him lying down near some bushes looking

at a Haradrim army marching across the

land. He moves to lie low beside Frodo.

Smeagol also moves in beside Frodo.]

Who are they?

Wicked men. Servants of Sauron. They

are called to Mordor. The Dark One is

gathering all armies to him. It wont

be long now. He will soon be ready.

Ready to do what?

To make his war. The last war that will

cover all the world in shadow.

Weve got to get moving. Come on, Sam.

[Suddenly grabs Frodos arm] Mr Frodo!

Look! Its an Oliphaunt!

[Gigantic Oliphaunts appear, carrying

soldiers and supplies on their backs.]

No one at home will believe this...

[Smeagol slips away unnoticed.]

[Looking around] Smeagol?

[Suddenly, pandemonium breaks out from

below; the soldiers are being ambushed.

Cloaked rangers are firing deadly arrows

at the soldiers and Oliphaunts from

behind bushes. One of the Oliphaunts

starts trumpeting and stomping towards

Frodo and Sam, swinging his huge trunk

and tusks. Faramir takes aim and shoots

a soldier. He falls from the Oliphaunt

and lands right behind Frodo and Sam,

dead.]

Weve lingered here too long. Come on,

Sam!

[Frodo runs right into a Gondorian Ranger,

who grabs hold of him and throws him

onto his back. Sam sees Frodo in danger

and grapples for his sword]

Ah!

[He charges at Faramir but is grabbed

by another ranger and thrown down. A

sword appears at his throat. Faramir

appears.]

Bind their hands.

[Meanwhile, the Rohirrim refugees are

heading towards Helms Deep. Gimli is

on a horse, chatting with Eowyn who

is leading it by the reins.]

Its true you dont see many Dwarf women.

And in fact, they are so alike in voice

and appearance, haha that theyre often

mistaken for Dwarf men.

[Eowyn smiles and looks back at Aragorn.]

[Gestures and whispers] Its the beards....

And this, in turn, has given rise to

the belief that there are no Dwarf women.

And that dwarves just spring out of

holes in the ground!

[Laughs gaily] Hahahaha!!

Hehehe! Which is of course ridiculous...

Whoa!!

[The horse suddenly rears up and gallops

away as Eowyn loses her hold on the

reins. Gimli falls off after a short

distance and lands with a loud thump.]

Ooh! [She rushes forward to Gimli]

[Struggling to get up] Its alright,

its alright. Nobody panic. That was

deliberate. It was deliberate.

[Eowyn helps Gimli up. She laughs as

she brushes him off and looks back at

Aragorn with the sun behind her and

the wind in her hair. At that particular

moment, Aragorn seems enchanted by Eowyns

light-hearted image. That night. Aragorn

could not sleep and smokes his pipe

as he thinks of Arwen.]

The light of the Evenstar does not wax

and wane... It is mine to give to whom

I will... Like my heart... Go to sleep...

Aragorn is lying on a chaise in Rivendell.

He opens his eyes and sees Arwen before

him, smiling down at him.]

I am asleep. This is a dream.

[Bends down to kiss him] Then it is

a good dream. Sleep...

[She kisses him lightly on the lips

and then steps away to look out upon

Rivendell. Aragorn closes his eyes but

for a while. He looks over at Arwen.]

Min lu pennich nin i aur hen telitha.

(You told me once that this day would

come.)

[Turns to look at Aragorn] U i vethed...

na i onnad. Boe bedich go Frodo. Han

bad lin. (This is not the end... it

is the beginning. You must go with Frodo.

That is your path.)

[Walks over to Arwen] Dolen i vad o

nin. (My path is hidden from me.)

Si peliannen i vad na dail lin. Si boe

u-dhannathach. (It is already laid before

your feet. You cannot falter now.)

Arwen...

[Arwen hushes him, resting her fingers

on his lips. As her hands moves down

to rest on the Evenstar pendant around

Aragorns neck, he clasps her hand in

his and they gaze into each others

eyes.]

Ae u-esteliach nad... estelio han. Estelio

ammen. (If you trust nothing else...

trust this. Trust us.)

[They kiss.]

[The next day, on the journey to Helms

Deep. Eowyn is walking alongside Aragorn.]

Where is she? The woman who gave you

that jewel.

Elrond is speaking to Aragorn in Rivendell,

before he sets out with the Fellowship.]

Our time here is ending. Arwens time

is ending. Let her go. Let her take

the ship into the west. Let her bear

away her love for you to the Undying

Lands. There it will be evergreen.

But never more than a memory.

I will not leave my daughter here to

die.

She stays because she still has hope.

She stays for YOU! She belongs with

her people!

[Aragorn and Arwen are together before

the Fellowship departs.]

Idhren emmen menna gui ethwel. Hae o

auth a nir a naeth. (You have a chance

for another life. Away from war... grief...

despair.)

Why are you saying this?

I am mortal; you are Elfkind. It was

a dream, Arwen, nothing more.

[He takes Arwens hand to return the

Evenstar necklace to her.]

This belongs to you.

[Closes Aragorns hand over the Evenstar]

It was a gift. Keep it.

[Scene shifts back to Aragorn and Eowyn]

My lord?

She is sailing to the Undying Lands,

with all that is left of her kin.

[Gamling and Hama ride to the front.

Legolas watches them as they pass.]

What is it? Hama?

[Their horses become restless.]

[Looking around] Im not sure.

[A warg scout appears on a slope above

and charges at them. The warg attacks

Hama and kills him.]

Wargs!

[Just as it starts to turn on Gamling,

Legolas runs over and kills the warg

with an arrow. He then draws his knife

and kills the Orc.]

Argh! [Shouts to Aragorn] A scout!

What is it? What do you see?

[Running back to Theoden] Wargs! We

are under attack!

[Hearing the alarm, the villagers begin

to cry and panic.]

Get them out of here!

All riders to the head of the column!

[Trying to mount Arod] Come on, get

me up here, Im a rider! Argh!

[Gimli gets onto the horse with some

help. Legolas gazes into the distance

and sees many warg-riders coming fast

towards them, kicking up dust trails

as they go.]

[To Eowyn] You must lead the people

to Helms Deep. And make haste!

I can fight!

No! You must do this... for me.

[Eowyn holds Theodens gaze for a moment

and then turn to attend to the villagers.]

[To his men] Follow me! Yah!

[Tries to get Arod to move] Forward.

I mean, charge forward! March forward!

[Arod moves off with Gimli seated rather

unsteadily.] Thats it! Go on!

[To the villagers] Make for the lower

ground! Stick together!

[She looks back at the Rohirrim and

sees Aragorn on Hasufel. They hold each

others gaze for a moment before Aragorn

turns to join Theoden. Eowyn departs

with the villagers in the opposite direction.]

[Legolas takes aim at the distant target

and fells a warg rider. He draws another

arrow and kills another. Just as he

reaches for a third arrow, he sees Theoden

and company approaching. He quickly

runs and mounts Arod with a smooth leap

and joins in the fray with Gimli behind

him on horseback.]

Argh!!

CHARGE!!

[The Rohirrim and warg riders crash

head on and the battle begins. Theoden

and company hack away at the warg riders.

In the midst of fighting, Gimli falls

off Arod. He turns to find a warg growling

at him.]

Bring your pretty face to my axe!

[Just as the warg leaps at Gimli, Legolas

kills it with one shot.]

[Jumping back as the warg falls, outraged]

Argh! That one counts as mine!

[As Gimli swings his axe at another

warg, it dies and falls onto Gimli,

pinning him under.]

Argh! Stinking creature. Argh!

[As he tries to lift the warg off him,

an Orc leans over them both. Gimli kills

him quickly, twisting his neck, and

it lands on him also. Gimli sniffs at

the Orc and makes a face. He tries to

lift both the warg and Orc off him.

Just then, another warg comes upon him

and bares its teeth, ready to strike.

]

[Eyes widening] Ooh..!

[Aragorn plucks a spear as he passes

on horseback and throws it at the warg.

It dies, landing on Gimli and adding

to the pile on top of him.]

[As the warg lands on him] Oooh!!

[Theoden stabs at a warg rider. Aragorn

is knocked off Hasufel and attacked

by Sharku. Aragorn tries to kill the

warg rider but Sharku blocks his attempt

and grabs Aragorn by the neck, while

the latter is half-dragged by the warg.

In the struggle, Sharku is thrown off

and he rips the Evenstar pendant from

Aragorns neck as he falls. Aragorn

tries to let go of the warg but finds

his wrist tangled with the saddle straps.

He tries unsuccessfully to disentangle

himself and is dragged closer and closer

to the edge of a cliff at great speed.

The warg runs right off the cliff and

they both disappear over the edge. The

battle is winding down as the Rohirrim

finish off the last few wargs and Orcs.]

[Looking around] Aragorn!

Aragorn?

[They come near to the cliff and hear

Sharku wheezing and laughing]

[Standing over the dying Orc] Tell me

what happened and I will ease your passing.

Hes [cough] dead. [Laughs evilly] Took

a little tumble off the cliff.

[Looks towards the edge of the cliff,

and grabs Sharku] You lie!

[Sharku chortles and dies. Legolas looks

down at Sharkus fist and finds the

Evenstar pendant. He takes it, runs

to the edge of the cliff and looks down

to see the great drop and rushing waters

below, with no sign of Aragorn. Gimli

comes to stand beside him.]

[To his men] Get the wounded on horses.

The wolves of Isengard will return.

Leave the dead.

[Legolas turns to Theoden, an expression

of perplexed anger on his face.]

[Puts a hand on Legolas' shoulder] Come.

[He leaves Legolas and Gimli to stare

down at the river.]

[The Rohan villagers are drawing close

to Helms Deep. Cries of relief are

heard as the refuge is within sight.]

Helms Deep! At last! There it is!

[To Eowyn] Were safe, my lady! Thank

you!

[Eowyn embraces the woman and they walk

on towards Helms Deep. The gate is

opened for the villagers. Many have

already taken refuge within and are

resting along the passage. Eothain and

Freda run towards their mother.]

Mama!

Eothain! Freda!

[The three hug and cry with joy. Theoden

and company returns from the battle

with warg riders]

Make way for Theoden!

Sire!

Make way for the king!

[Eowyn rushes down to meet them]

[Looking about] So few. So few of you

have returned.

[Dismounting] Our people are safe. We

have paid for it with many lives.

[Going up to Eowyn] My lady...

Lord Aragorn, where is he?

He fell...

[Eowyn is shaken and raises teary eyes

to Theoden. The latter looks down and

then walks away, confirming her unasked

question.]

[At the battlements]

Draw all our forces behind the wall.

Bar the gate, and set a watch on the

surround.

What of those who cannot fight, my lord?

The women and children?

Get them into the caves. [Walks down

the steps and past a sewer gate] Saruman's

arm would have grown long indeed if

he thinks he can reach us here.

[Camera zooms in on the gate]

Helms Deep has one weakness. Its outer

wall is solid rock but for a small culvert

at its base which is little more than

a drain.

[Camera turns to Grima and Saruman at

Orthanc. Saruman is pouring some dark

dry substances into a vessel. Grima

is holding a lit candle in his hand.]

How? How can fire undo stone? What kind

of device could bring down the wall?

[As he steps closer to the vessel, Saruman

takes hold of Grimas hand and pushes

the candle away from the vessel firmly.]

If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep

will fall.

[He walks away towards the balcony.]

[Following Saruman] Even if it is breached,

it would take a number beyond reckoning,

thousands to storm the keep.

Tens of thousands.

But, my lord, there is no such force.

[Both of them came onto the balcony

of the tower. Grima suddenly sees and

hears the enormous armies laid out below

in neat rows and is astounded and awed.

He continues to hold the extinguished

candle aloft as he gapes at the vast

army below. A horn is sounded, announcing

the appearance of Saruman. A loud cheer

is heard from the army. Saruman raises

a hand.]

A new power is rising. Its victory is

at hand!

[The army cheers and roars.]

This night, the land will be stained

with the blood of Rohan! March to Helms

Deep! Leave none alive!

[The camera keeps zooming out from the

balcony over the incredible size of

Sarumans army, past Uruk-hai, spears,

and banners and yet more Uruk-hai. The

camera focuses back on Saruman who then

raises his hands in the air]

To war!!

[The army cheers and roars even louder.]

[Sneers] There will be no dawn for Men.

[A tear flows down Grimas cheek. The

Uruk-hai army began their march to Helms

Deep.]

[Merry and Pippin are travelling through

the forest, carried by Treebeard.]

Look! Theres smoke to the south!

There is always smoke rising from Isengard

these days.

Isengard?

[The two hobbits climb higher up onto

Treebeard for a better view.]

There was a time when Saruman would

walk in my woods. But now he has a mind

of metal and wheels. He no longer cares

for growing things.

[Pippin and Merry are now on top of

Treebeard and they see a massive army

moving across the land]

What is it?

Its Sarumans army! The war has started.

[Aragorn is floating in the river, unconscious.

He is washed ashore and dreams of Arwen.]

[Kissing him on the lips] May the grace

of the Valar protect you.

[A horse arrives and nudges Aragorn,

turning him over and nuzzling him.]

[Mumbles] Brego... [He grabs hold of Bregos

mane, pulls himself onto the horse and

rides slowly to Helms Deep.]

[Arwen is lying on her bed, deep in

thought.]

[Coming into her room] Arwen.

[Arwen hears him and sits up.]

Tollen i lu. I chair gwannar na Valannor.

Si bado, no cirar. (Arwen, it is time.

The ships are leaving for Valinor. Go

now... before it is too late.)

I have made my choice.

He is not coming back. Why do you linger

here when there is no hope?

There is still hope.

[Walks towards window and looks out]

If Aragorn survives this war, you will

still be parted. If Sauron is defeated,

and Aragorn made king and all that you

hope for comes true, you will still

have to taste the bitterness of mortality.

Whether by the sword or the slow decay

of time, Aragorn will die.

[Arwen sees a vision of her future as

Elrond speaks. She is dressed as a queen

in mourning garb and looking down upon

Aragorn, a crown on his brow, Anduril

in his hand, and dead. Mourners are

walking around the altar, paying their

final respects. Arwen is weeping.]

And there will be no comfort for you.

No comfort to ease the pain of his passing.

He will come to death, an image of the

splendor of the kings of men in glory

undimmed before the breaking of the

world.

[The body of Aragorn is now cast as

a monument in stone. Arwen stands before

the monument, veiled and in black.]

But you, my daughter, you will linger

on in darkness and in doubt. As nightfall

in winter that comes without a star.

Here you will dwell, bound to your grief,

under the fading trees, until all the

world is changed and the long years

of your life are utterly spent.

[Still veiled in black, Arwen is walking

alone through the deserted woods of

Lothlorien.]

[Tuning to Arwen] Arwen... there is

nothing for you here, only death.

[The vision ends and Arwen weeps with

sadness and fear. Elrond comes to sit

beside his daughter and raises a hand

to her cheek.]

A im, u-'erin veleth lin? (Do I not

also have your love?)

[Crying and moving into her fathers

embrace] Gerich meleth nin, ada. (You

have my love, father)

[Elves, cloaked and carrying a lantern

each, are setting off from Rivendell

on their journey to the West. Elrond

looks on as Arwen leaves with them.

Arwen turns back to look at her father

one last time before she departs. Elrond

continues to stare after her with an

expression of resigned sadness.]

[Elrond is standing by a window. He

hears Galadriel speaking.]

I amar prestar aen... han mathon ne

nen, han mathon ne chae a han nostan

ned gwilith. (The world has changed...

I feel it in the water, I feel it in

the earth, I smell it in the air.) The

power of the enemy is growing. [Saruman

is communicating with Sauron via the

Palantir.] Sauron will use his puppet

Saruman to destroy the people of Rohan.

Isengard has been unleashed. [View of

Saruman's marching army] The eye of

Sauron now turns to Gondor, the last

free kingdom of men. [View of Osgiliath]

His war on this country will come swiftly.

He senses the Ring is close. The strength

of the Ringbearer is failing. In his

heart, Frodo begins to understand. [Close-up

of Galadriel] The quest will claim his

life. You know this. You have foreseen

it. It is the risk we all took.

[Close-up of the Ring spinning in slow

motion]

In the gathering dark, the will of the

Ring grows strong. It works hard now

to find its way back into the hands

of men.

[We see Faramir and Gondorian rangers

with the captured Frodo and Sam.]

Men, who are so easily seduced by its

power. The young captain of Gondor has

but to extend his hands, take the Ring

for his own and the world will fall.

It is close now, so close to achieving

its goal.

[Faramir and company have reached Henneth

Annun. Frodo and Sam and being carries,

blinded-folded into the cave.]

For Sauron will have dominion of all

life on this Earth, even unto the ending

of the world. The time of the Elves

is over.

[Close-up of Galadriel's luminous eyes

with their deep pools of wisdom. We

then see Elrond in his library, looking

at the painting of Isildur facing down

Sauron with the broken blade of Narsil.]

Do we leave Middle-earth to its fate?

Do we let them stand alone?

[Scene returns to Henneth Annun. Faramir

is conferring with his man. They unroll

a map.]

What news?

Our scouts report Saruman has attacked

Rohan. Theodens people have fled to

Helms Deep. [Points at the map] But

we must look to our own borders. Faramir,

Orcs are on the move. Sauron is marshalling

an army. Easterlings and Southrons are

passing through the Black Gate.

How many?

Some thousands. More come every day.

Whos covering the river to the north?

We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath, but

if the city is attacked, we wont hold

it.

[Tracing on the map] Saruman attacks

from Isengard. Sauron from Mordor. The

fight will come to men on both fronts.

Gondor is weak. Sauron will strike us

soon. And he will strike hard. He knows

now we do not have the strength to repel

him.

[The hobbits are unbound and blindfolds

taken off them by Damrod and another

ranger. Sam and Frodo find themselves

in a cave behind a waterfall, with Damrod

sitting behind them on a rock constantly

watching them. Faramir comes up to them

and sits.].

My men tell me that you are Orc spies.

Spies?! Now wait just a minute!

Well if youre not spies, then who are

you?

[Frodo and Sam remain silent.]

Speak.

We are hobbits of the Shire. Frodo Baggins

is my name and this is Samwise Gamgee.

Your bodyguard?

His gardener.

And where is your skulking friend? That

gangrel creature. He had an ill-favoured

look.

[The merest hesitation.] There was no

other.

[Sam looks shifty-eyed and uncomfortable.]

We set out from Rivendell with seven

companions. One we lost in Moria. Two

were my kin. A Dwarf there was also,

and an Elf. And two men, Aragorn, son

of Arathorn, and Boromir of Gondor.

[Intently] Youre a friend of Boromir?

Yes... for my part.

It will grieve you then to learn that

he is dead.

[Shocked] Dead? How? When?

As one of his companions, Id hoped

you would tell me. [Pause] He was my

brother.

[Faramir is sitting alone, deep in thought.

Suddenly someone comes up to him.]

Captain Faramir. [whispers] We found

the third one.

[Frodo and Sam are sleeping. Frodo awakens

as Faramir stands before him.]

You must come with me. Now.

[Frodo gets up and follow. They come

to the edge of the waterfall, overlooking

the Forbidden Pool.]

[Pointing down] Down there.

[Frodo looks down and sees Gollum diving

into the water.]

To enter the forbidden pool bears the

penalty of death. [He gestures to archers

hidden in the bushes.] They wait for

my command.

[The Rangers notch their arrows]

Shall I shoot?

[Frodo looks stricken. Gollum emerges

from the pool onto a rock. He holds

a fish in his hand and starts singing,

slapping the fish on the rock as he

goes.]

[singing] The rock and pool is nice

and cool, so juicy sweet! I only wish

[Whacks the fish on the rock] to catch

a fish [whacks], so juicy sweet! [The

fish almost wriggles out of his grasp

and he whacks it some more.]

[Faramir has his hand raised to order

his men to shoot. At the last moment,

Frodo calls out.]

Wait! [Faramir stops] This creature

is bound to me. And I to him. He is

our guide. Please, let me go down to

him.

[Faramir nods. Frodo descends to the

Forbidden Pool and approaches Gollum

who is gorging on the raw fish.]

Smeagol. [Gollum turns round at Frodos

voice.] Master is here. Come, Smeagol.

Trust master. Come!

[Frodo gestures for Gollum to follow

him.]

We must go now?

Smeagol, you must trust master. Follow

me, come on. Come. Come, Smeagol. Nice

Smeagol. Thats it. Come on.

[With the fish between his teeth, Gollum

follows Frodo warily. Suddenly he looks

up in alarm and is caught by Rangers.]

Dont hurt him! Smeagol dont struggle!

Smeagol listen to me!

[wails] Master!!

[A black cloth is brought over Gollum's

head. Frodo stares after them with a

stricken expression as Faramir leads

Gollum and his men away. Back in the

cave, Gollum is thrown down to the ground.

Crying, he crawls into a corner and

curls up into ball.]

No! No!

Where are you leading them? Answer me!

[Cooing, his hand stroking his shoulder]

Smea...gol... Why does it cry, Smeagol?

[Sobbing] Cruel men hurts us. Master

trickst us.

Of course he did. I told you he was

tricksy. I told you he was false.

[Sobbing] Master is our friend... our

friend.

Master betrayed us.

No, not its business. Leave us alone!

[Hits his fist against the wall] Filthy

little hobbitses. They stole it from

us.

[Whimpers] No... No!

What did they steal?

[Turns to Faramir with a ferocious expression]

Myyy... PRECIOUSSS!! [He bares his teeth

and growls] Aaaarrrggghhh!!!

[Back in their holding area, Sam and

Frodo are alone.]

We have to get out of here. You go.

Go, now! You can do it. Use the Ring,

Mr. Frodo. Just this once. Put it on.

Disappear.

I cant. You were right, Sam. You tried

to tell me, but... Im sorry. The Rings

taking me Sam. If I put it on, hell

find me. Hell see.

Mr. Frodo...

[They both stand as Faramir enters.]

[Unsheathes his sword] So... this is

the answer to all the riddles. Here

in the wild I have you. Two halflings

and a host of men at my call. The Ring

of power within my grasp.

[Faramir lifts the Ring from Frodo's

neck with the tip of his sword.]

A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor,

to show his quality.

[Frodo is backed up fearfully against

the wall. The Ring whispers and Frodo

falls into a trance. Suddenly, he grabs

the Ring in his hand and jerks himself

away.]

No!! [He runs away from Faramir]

Stop it! Leave him alone! Dont you

understand? Hes got to destroy it.

Thats where were going. Into Mordor.

To the mountain of fire.

[Faramir stares at Frodo. Just then

Damrod enters.]

Osgiliath is under attack. They call

for reinforcements.

Please. Its such a burden. Will you

not help him?

Captain?

Prepare to leave. The Ring will go to

Gondor. [He turns to leave.]

[Sam looks after Faramir sadly.]

[Aragorn is riding towards Helms Deep.

On the way, he sees an enormous Uruk-hai

army marching with great speed. He quickly

makes haste towards Helms Deep and

soon sees the refuge.]

[Patting Brego on the neck] Mae carnen,

Brego, mellon nin. (Well done, Brego,

my friend)

[He rides into Helms Deep to the amazement

of all.]

Hes alive!

[Pushing his way through the crowd.]

Where is he? Where is he? Get out of

the way. Im gonna kill him! [He sees

Aragorn.] You are the luckiest, the

canniest and the most reckless man I

ever knew! [He hugs Aragorn.] Bless

you, laddie!

Gimli, where is the king?

[Gimli gestures to the hall. As Aragorn

makes his way in, he runs into Legolas

who stands waiting.]

Le ab-dollen. (Youre late.) [They smile.

Legolas pauses and looks at Aragorns

wounds.] You look terrible.

[To the side, Eowyn sees Aragorn and

smiles joyously and with relief. Legolas

takes Aragorns hand and gives the Evenstar

pendant. Aragorn looks at the Evenstar

and claps Legolas on the shoulder.]

Hannon le. (Thank you.)

[Eowyn looks on and smiles even as tears

fill her eyes.]

[Aragorn is in the keep, conferring

with Theoden]

A great host, you say?

All Isengard is emptied

How many?

Ten thousand strong at least.

Ten thousand?!

It is an army bred for a single purpose:

to destroy the world of men. They will

be here by nightfall.

Let them come! [Walks away resolutely]

[Along the passage behind the Deeping

Wall.]

[to Gamling] I want every man and strong

lad able to bear arms to be ready for

battle by nightfall.

[Gamling nods and goes off. Theoden

stands at the gate of Helms Deep, speaking

to Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli.]

We will cover the causeway and the gate

from above. No army has ever breached

the Deeping Wall or set foot inside

the Hornburg.

This is no rabble of mindless Orcs.

These are Uruk-hai. Their armor is thick

and their shields broad.

I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.

I know how to defend my own keep.

[Gimli seems miffed. Legolas claps a

hand on Gimlis shoulder as he follows

Aragorn and Theoden back in.]

They will break upon this fortress like

water on rock. Sarumans hordes will

pillage and burn, weve seen it before.

Crops can be resown; homes rebuilt.

Within these walls, we will outlast

them.

They do not come to destroy Rohans

crops or villages. They come to destroy

its people. Down to the last child.

[Draws close to Aragorn] What would

you have me do? Look at my men. Their

courage hangs by a thread. If this is

to be our end, then I would have them

make such an end as to be worthy of

remembrance.

Send out riders, my lord. You must call

for aid.

And who will come? Elves? Dwarves? We

are not so lucky in our friends as you.

The old alliances are dead.

Gondor will answer.

Gondor? Where was Gondor when the Westfold

fell? Where was Gondor when our enemies

closed in around us? Where was Gon...

[He walks away, calling out orders]

Get the women and children into the

caves.

We need more time to lay provisions

for a siege, lord

[Cutting him off] There is no time.

War is upon us!

[to the soldiers] Secure the gate!

[Men rush to prepare for battle as flocks

of carrion crows circle overhead.]

[Treebeard walks through the forest

carrying Merry and Pippin. He comes

to a clearing and stops.]

We Ents have not troubled about the

wars of men and wizards for a very long

time. But now something is about to

happen that has not happened for an

age... Ent Moot.

Whats that?

'Tis a gathering.

A gathering of what?

[Merry and Pippin turns round as they

hear movement from the forest around

them. They see many more Ents like Treebeard

gathering.]

Beech, oak, chestnut, ash... Good, good,

good. Many have come. Now we must decide

if the Ents will go to war.

[Merry licks his lips in anticipation.]

[Back at Helms Deep, the women and

children are being led into the caves.]

Move back! Move to the caves!

Keep moving!

Quickly now!

[Old men and young lads are being drafted

for war. The women and children say

their tearful and reluctant farewells

as their fathers, husbands and sons

are led away by soldiers. In the armoury,

weapons are being distributed. Aragorn

picks up a battered sword, looks at

it and tosses it back.]

Farmer, farriers, stable boys. These

are no soldiers.

Most have seen too many winters.

Or too few. Look at them. Theyre frightened.

I can see it in their eyes. [The men

around them fell silent. Legolas speaks

to Aragorn.] Boe a hun: neled herain

dan caer menig! (And they should be...

Three hundred against ten thousand!)

Si beriathar hyn. Amar na ned Edoras.

(They have more hope of defending themselves

here than at Edoras.)

Aragorn, men i ndagor. Hyn u-... ortheri.

Natha daged aen! (Aragorn, we are warriors.

They cannot win this fight. They are

all going to die!)

Then I shall die as one them! [He pauses

and then walks away. Legolas makes as

if to go after him.]

[Puts a hand on Legolas] Let him go,

lad. Let him be.

[In the hall]

Every villager able to wield a sword

has been sent to the armory. My lord?

Who am I, Gamling?

You are our king, sire.

And do you trust your king?

[Puts armour onto Theoden] Your men,

my lord, will follow you to whatever

end.

[The villagers are handed their weapons.

An oversized helmet is placed on a wide-eyed

boy. Another stares at the axe that

he is handed with frightened eyes. Another

child wearing oversized chain mail takes

up a huge shield. Theoden stands inside

the main hall of the keep, his back

to the entrance where a bright white

light is streaming through.]

To whatever end... Where is the horse

and the rider? Where is the horn that

was blowing? They have passed like rain

on the mountains. Like wind in the meadow.

The days have gone down in the west.

Behind the hills, into shadow. How did

it come to this?

[Everyone is getting ready for war at

the battlements. Aragorn is sitting

on the steps. He sees a young lad in

armour holding a sword looking around

nervously.]

Give me your sword. What is your name?

Haleth, son of Hama, my lord. The men

are saying that we will not live out

the night. They say that it is hopeless..

[Aragorn gives the battered sword a

few swings.]

This is a good sword, Haleth, son of

Hama.

[He hands the sword back to Haleth and

leans close to him, putting a hand on

his shoulder.]

There is always hope.

[Back at the armoury, Aragorn dons his

battle gear. His sword is handed to

him as he reaches for it. He nods and

accepts the sword from Legolas.]

We have trusted you this far. You have

not led us astray. Forgive me. I was

wrong to despair.

U-moe edhored, Legolas. (There is nothing

to forgive, Legolas.)

[They smile and clap one another on

the shoulders. They look at Gimli as

he walks up to them, struggling with

his chain mail.]

If we had more time Id get this adjusted.

[He drops the bundle and the chain mail

lands with its length right to the floor.]

Its a little tight across the chest.

[Aragorn and Legolas bite back smiles.

Just then, a horn sounds in the background]

That is no Orc horn. [They run out to

the battlements.]

[The guards look down in wonderment.]

[to another guard] Send for the king.

Open the gate!

Open the gate!

[An army of Lothlorien Elves march up

the Causeway into the Hornburg. They

are led by Haldir. The Rohirrim soldiers

look upon them in wonderment and delight

as they pass.]

How is this possible?

I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.

An alliance once existed between Elves

and men. Long ago we fought and died

together. [He looks up to see Aragorn,

Legolas and Gimli running down the steps,

and smiles] We come to honor that allegiance.

[He bows] Mae govannen, Haldir. (Welcome,

Haldir) [He grabs Haldir in a huge embrace.

Initially stunned, Haldir hugs him back

lightly.]

You are most welcome!

[Legolas and Haldir clasp each other

on the shoulder.]

[Turning to Theoden] We are proud to

fight alongside men, once more.

[Men and Elves are in their positions

on the battlements of Helms Deep. The

sounds of a marching army move closer

and closer. The women and children in

the caves hear the sounds overhead and

are frightened. Mothers draw their children

close and try to sooth crying babies.

The men and Elves look out into the

darkness, lit by the thousands of torches

carried by the huge advancing Uruk-hai

army and the light bouncing off their

armour. With a row of Elf archers, Gimli

is standing beside Legolas behind a

wall, only the top of his helmet visible.]

[Grumbling and straining to look above

the wall.] You could have picked a better

spot.

[Legolas smirks. Aragorn approaches

and stands beside them]

Well lad, whatever luck you live by,

lets hope it lasts the night.

[Thunder sounds and lightning flashes,

revealing the sea of approaching Uruk-hai.]

Your friends are with you, Aragorn.

Lets hope they last the night.

[The marching and thumping grows louder

and louder. Lightning flashes and it

begins to rain. While the Uruk-hai army

continues to march at the fortress,

an Uruk-hai leader steps on a rock outcrop.]

[Aragorn is giving commands to the Elf

warriors.]

A Eruchin, u-dano i faelas a hyn an

uben tanatha le faelas! (Show them no

mercy! For you shall receive none!)

[The Uruk-hai leader raises his swords

and commands his army to stop with a

terrifying animalic cry. The Uruks stop

and growl in anticipation of the upcoming

battle and slaughter]

[Jumping and straining to see] Whats

happening out there?

Shall I describe it to you? [Looks at

Gimli with a grin] Or would you like

me to find you a box?

[Laughs good-naturedly] Hehehehe!!

[The Uruk Leader cries out once, encouraging

the Uruk-hai to start roaring and thumping

their spears furiously.The women and

children in the caves huddle together

in fear. Suddenly, Aldor, the old man

next to Haleth, loses his grip and releases

his arrow prematurely, shooting an Uruk-hai

in the neck.]

Dartho! (Hold!)

[The Uruk-hai army stop their roaring

and thumping. With a hollow groan, the

Uruk that was shot collapsed to the

ground. The other Uruk-hai bare their

teeth and roar with anger. With a cry,

the Uruk-hai leader thrusts his weapon

in the air and the Uruk-hai army starts

charging.]

So it begins.

Tangado halad! (Prepare to fire!)

[The Elves notch their arrow and aim.]

Faeg i-varv din na lanc a nu ranc. (Their

armor is weak at the neck and beneath

the arms.)

Leithio i philinn! (Release the arrows!)

[Arrows rain down on the Uruk-hai below,

killing many.]

Did they hit anything?

Give them a volley.

[to the men] Fire!

Fire!

[More arrows are released. But the Uruk-hai

army keep advancing, with more replacing

those fallen.]

Fire!

[Impatiently] Send them to me! Cmon!

[The Uruk-hai start to load ladders

onto the walls, pushing them up with

their long spears.]

Pendraid! (Ladders!)

[The Elves draw their blades in preparation

for combat. The first ladders are almost

reaching the walls with big nasty Uruk

Berserkers on top of them.]

Swords! Swords!

Good!

[Close combat begins as the Uruk-hai

climb over the wall.]

Legolas, two already! [Holding up two

fingers]

Im on seventeen!

[Outraged] Argh! Ill have no pointy-ear

outscoring me! [He turns to a Uruk just

climbing over the wall, whacking it

in the groin with his axe and killing

it as it falls.]

[Fires two arrows] Nineteen!

[The Ent Moot is still in progress.

The Ents sway a little as they continue

to deliberate. Merry and Pippin are

sitting a distance away. Suddenly, Treebeard

nods and turns to the hobbits.]

[Gesturing] Merry!

We have just agreed. [Long pause with

his eyes closed.]

[Angles his head in query] Yes?

I have told your names to the Ent moot

and we have agreed  you are not Orcs.

Well, thats good news.

[impatiently] And what about Saruman?

Have you come to a decision about HIM?

[Waving a hand] Now dont be hasty,

Master Meriadoc.

Hasty? Our friends are out there! They

need our help! They cannot fight this

war on their own.

War, yes... It affects us all. But you

must understand, young hobbit. It takes

a loong time to say anything in ooold...

Entish. [Merry and Pippin roll their

eyes in disgruntlement.] And we never

say anything... unless it is worth taking

a looong... time to say.

[Gimli is standing on the wall between

two ladders, hacking away at Uruk-hai

as they come up]

Seventeen! Eighteen! Nineteen! Twenty!

Twenty-one! Twenty-two!

[Camera pans over the Uruk-hai below

and turns to the Causeway. A group of

Uruk-hai is advancing on the Causeway

towards the gate in tortoise formation,

using their broad shields to block off

attacks.]

Na fennas! (Causeway!) [Directs the

Elf archers to aim at the Uruk-hai column.]

[The Elf archers release their arrows.

The Uruk-hai at the sides are shot and

fall down the Causeway. But the column

keeps advancing.]

Is this it? Is this all you can conjure,

Saruman?

[At the bottom of the Deeping Wall,

two spiky bombs are lodge in the sluice

gate. The rest opens a path and an Uruk-hai

carrying a torch starts to run towards

the sluice gate. Aragorn spots the Uruk-hai.]

Togo hon dad, Legolas! (Bring him down,

Legolas!) [Legolas shoots the Uruk-hai

in the shoulder but the latter keeps

going] Dago hon! Dago hon! (Kill him!

Kill him!)

[Legolas shoots the Uruk again. It stumbles

and then throws it self and the torch

at the bombs. An enormous explosion

is set off, blowing away a large part

of the wall. Rock, debris and bodies

are thrown up. Aragorn is also thrown

back by the force of the explosion and

on the ground, knocked out. Theoden

looks on in shock as the Uruk-hai streams

in past the Deeping Walls.]

Brace the Gate! Hold them! Stand firm!

[Gimli sees the Uruk-hai charging in

with Aragorn in their path. With a cry,

he jumps down from the wall and lands

on the Uruk-hai army, taking them out

as he stands.]

Aragorn!! Argh!

[He is soon overpowered. Aragorn gets

up and sees Gimli falling.]

Gimli! [He yells to the Elves behind

him] Hado i philinn! (Hurl the arrows!)

[The arrows take out the first group

of Uruk-hai coming through the hole

in the wall.]

Herio! (Charge!)

[Aragorn leads the Elves in a charge

towards the Uruk-hai streaming in. He

rushes to Gimlis side and picks him

up. At the top of the battlements, Legolas

grabs a shield and sends it sliding

across the ground. He then hops onto

it and surfs down the steps, releasing

three arrows as he goes, and kicking

the shield to stab an Uruk-hai as he

lands at the bottom.]

[At the Ent Moot]

The Ents cannot hold back this storm.

We must weather such things as we have

always done.

How can that be your decision?!

This is not our war.

But you're part of this world! Arent

you?! [The Ents look at one another,

taken back] You must help, please! You

must do something!

You are young and brave, Master Merry.

But your part in this tale is over.

Go back to your home.

[Merry is putting on his jacket. Pippin

approaches him slowly]

Maybe Treebeards right. We dont belong

here, Merry. It's too big for us. What

can we do in the end? We've got the

Shire. Maybe we should go home.

[Looking into the distance.] The fires

of Isengard will spread. And the woods

of Tuckborough and Buckland will burn.

And all that was once green and good

in this world will be gone. [Turns to

Pippin and puts a hand on his shoulder]

There won't be a Shire, Pippin.

[Pippin looks after Merry as he walks

away.]

Aragorn! Fall back to the Keep! Get

your men out of there!

Na Barad! Na Baraad! Haldir, na Barad!

(To the Keep! Pull back to the Keep!

Haldir, to the Keep!)

[Haldir nods and turns back. Gimli is

being carried away, kicking and struggling

as he goes]

[Protesting] What are you doing? Argh!

What are you stopping for!

[HALDIR HACKS AT A FEW URUK AS HE TURNS TOWARDS

With a grimace, he kills the Uruk-hai

and looks down as his wound in seeming

disbelief. An Uruk-hai comes up from

behind him unnoticed and slices him

on the neck. As Haldir goes down, he

looks around him and sees his kin fallen

among dead Uruk-hai.]

[Sees Haldir falling] HALDIR!! [He runs

up the steps to Haldirs side and catches

him and he collapses. Haldir's head

rolls back, his eyes empty and unseeing.

Aragorn bows his head in grief. Then

with a cry, he jumps onto a ladder and

swings down to the ground, killing as

he goes.]

Brace the gate!

Hold them!

[Drawing his sword] To the gate! Draw

your swords!

[Theoden and his commanders come to

the gate, which is under heavy attack.

The Uruk-hai are knocking down the gate

and hacking through the broken wood.

Theoden stabs at an Uruk-hai and receives

a lance in his shoulder, blocked by

his armour. Grimacing in pain, Theoden

continues to stab at the Uruk until

led away by Gamling.]

Make way! We cannot hold much longer.

Hold them!

[Runs up and stabs away at the Uruk-hai

through the broken gate] How long do

you need?

Brace the gate!

As long as you can give me!

Gimli!

Timbers! Brace the Gate!

[Aragorn and Gimli slip out a side exit

and stand on a ledge just to the side

of the main gate. Aragorn peeks over,

seeing the large band of Uruk-hai storming

the gate.]

Come on! We can take em!

Its a long way.

[Gimli takes a peek and then steps back.]

[Mumbles] Toss me.

What?

I cannot jump the distance! Youll have

to toss me!

[Aragorn nods slowly and then turns

to grab the Dwarf.]

Oh! [Gimli stays Aragorns hand] Dont

tell the Elf.

Not a word.

[He tosses Gimli to the head of the

Causeway and then leaps over.]

[Making quick work of killing the Uruk-hai]

ARGH!!

[On the other side of the gate]

Shore up the door!

Make way!

Follow me to the barricade.

Watch our backs!

Throw another one over here!

Higher!

[Men are bracing the gate with wood

and nails. Aragorn and Gimli continue

to fight off the Uruk-hai just outside.

Meanwhile the Uruk-hai load and fires

enormous hooks over the battlements.

Hundred of Uruk-hai climb onto super-ladders

as they are pulled up towards the walls,

the super-ladders locking onto the edge

of the battlements with their steel

grips. Legolas takes aim as another

super-ladder is being pulled up and

shoots away one of the ropes. The ladder

falls back onto the Uruk-hai army.]

Hold fast the gate!]

[Through a crack in the gate] Gimli!

Aragorn! Get out of there!

[Legolas calls to them from the top

of the battlements]

Aragorn! [He throws them a rope]

[Aragorn grabs Gimli in one hand and

the rope with the other as they are

pulled up the wall. Just then the Uruk-hai

load and fires enormous hooks over the

battlements. Hundred of Uruk-hai climb

onto super-ladders as they are pulled

up towards the walls, the super-ladders

locking onto the edge of the battlements

with their steel grips. Legolas takes

aim as another super-ladder is being

pulled up and shoots away one of the

ropes. The ladder falls back onto the

Uruk-hai army.]

Pull everybody back! Pull them back!

Fall back! Fall back!

Theyve broken through! The castle is

breached. Retreat!

Fall back!

Retreat!

Hurry! Inside! Get them inside!

Into the Keep!

[They all run towards the keep, Legolas

firing two arrows into the Uruk-hai

army as he goes.]

[Treebeard is walking through the forest,

carrying Merry and Pippin. The hobbits

look dejected.]

I will leave you at the western borders

of the forest. You can make your way

north to your homeland from there.

[Pippin suddenly looks up with a gleam

in his eyes.]

Wait! Stop! Stop! [Treebeard comes to

a stop.] Turn around. Turn around. Take

us south!

South? But that will lead you past Isengard.

Yes. Exactly. If we go south we can

slip past Saruman unnoticed. The closer

we are to danger, the farther we are

from harm. Its the last thing hell

expect.

Mmmm. That doesnt make sense to me.

But then, you are very small. Perhaps

youre right. South it is then. Hold

on, little Shirelings. I always like

going south. Somehow it feels like going

down hill.

Are you mad? Well be caught!

No we wont. Not this time.

[Faramir and company draws close to

Osgiliath.]

Look! Osgiliath burns!

Mordor has come.

[With tears in his eyes] The Ring will

not save Gondor. It has only the power

to destroy. Please, let me go.

[Faramir hesitates for a moment.]

Hurry. [He presses them on]

Faramir, you must let me go!

[Frodo and Sam are pushed on towards

Osgiliath]

[Treebeard, Merry and Pippin come to

the southern edge of the forest.]

And a little family of field mice that

climb up sometimes and they tickle me

awfully. Theyre always trying to get

somewhere where they  Oh!! [He sees

the desolated landscape of tree stumps

that used to be forested grounds] Many

of these trees were my friends. Creatures

I had known from nut and acorn.

Im sorry, Treebeard.

[With tears in his eyes] They had voices

of their own. [His gaze turns to the

treeless Isengard and its smoking caverns]

Saruman! A wizard should know better!

[He lets out a ferocious roar that echoes

through the forest]

There is no curse in Elvish, Entish

or the tongues of men for this treachery.

My business is with Isengard tonight.

With rock and stone!

[Merry and Pippin turn around as they

hear rumbles from the forest. They see

many Ents emerging and marching towards

them]

Yes!

Hoorarooom... Come my friends. The Ents

are going to war. It is likely that

we go to our doom. Last march of the

Ents!

[Osgiliath is still under siege as Faramir

and company arrives, dodging arrows

and falling rocks.]

Faramir, Orcs have taken the eastern

shore. Their numbers are too great.

By nightfall well be overrun.

[Frodo suddenly seems stricken]

Mr Frodo!

Its calling to him, Sam. His eye is

almost on me.

Hold on, Mr. Frodo... You'll be alright...

[Frodo sees that Sam is speaking to

him but he hears nothing. His senses

are overcome.]

Take them to my father. Tell him Faramir

sends a mighty gift. A weapon that will

change our fortunes in this war.

[Sam breaks away as they are being led

away.]

Do you want to know what happened to

Boromir? You want to know why your brother

died? He tried to take the Ring from

Frodo! After swearing an oath to protect

him, he tried to kill him! The Ring

drove your brother mad!

Watch out!

[A boulder crashes into a tower overhead

and shatters it. Suddenly, Frodos eyes

roll up and he stares at Faramir strangely.]

Mr Frodo?

[In a faraway voice] Theyre here. Theyve

come.

[Looking up] NAZGUL!! [He grabs the

hobbits and thrusts them into a corner.]

Stay here. Keep out of sight. [To his

men] Take cover!

[Banners of the White Hand are flying

from the battlements of Helms Deep.

The Hornburg is overrun with Uruk-hai.

Theoden and company are in the hall

of the keep.]

The fortress is taken. It is over.

[Carrying a table with Legolas to shore

up the door of the hall] You said this

fortress would never fall while your

men defend it! They still defend it!

They have died defending it!

[In the Glittering Caves, the women

and children cry in fear as they hear

the battering ram banging on the door.]

They are breaking in!

Is there no other way for the women

and children to get out of the caves?

[There is no answer.] Is there no other

way?

There is one passage. It leads into

the mountains. But they will not get

far. The Uruk-hai are too many.

Send word for the women and children

to make for the mountain pass. And barricade

the entrance.

So much death. What can men do against

such reckless hate?

[Pause] Ride out with me. Ride out and

meet them.

[A light of determination shines in

his eyes] For death and glory.

For Rohan. For your people.

The sun is rising.

[Aragorn looks up at a window to see

faint light streaming through. He recalls

Gandalf's words.]

Look to my coming at first light on

the fifth day. At dawn, look to the

east.

Yes. Yes! The horn of Helm Hammerhand

shall sound in the deep one last time!

Yes! [Gimli runs up the steps to the

horn of Helm Hammerhand]

Let this be the hour when we draw swords

together. Fell deeds awake. Now for

wrath! Now for ruin! And a red dawn!

[He mounts his horse and puts on his

helmet. The sound of the horn rumbles

through Helm's Deep as Gimli blows with

gusto.]

FORTH EORLINGAS!!

[Theoden leads the charge out of the

keep into the Hornburg, slashing away

at the Uruk-hai as they go. Without

pause, they storm out of the gate and

down the Causeway, right into the column

of waiting Uruk-hai. In the midst of

battle, Aragorn looks east and sees

a white rider against the rising sun]

Gandalf.

Theoden king stands alone.

[Coming up from behind] Not alone. [He

raises a hand] Rohirrim!!

[Riders move up behind Eomer.]

[Looking to the east] Eomer!

To the king!

[The Rohirrim and the White Rider charge

down the slope. Half the Uruk-hai army

turns to face the challenge, bearing

their spears down towards the riders.

As the riders draw closer, the sun rises

behind them, momentarily blinding the

Uruk-hai who raise the hands (and spears)

to shield their eyes. The riders crash

right into the Uruk-hai and engage them

in battle.]

[The Ents are stomping over Isengard,

swinging their huge limbs, throwing

and stamping on Orcs and rolling huge

boulders over the ground. An Ent is

pulled down with chains by some Orcs,

who immediately jump on and hacks away

at his wooden limbs. Saruman rushes

out onto the balcony of Orthanc and

stares at the pandemonium in incredulity.

Merry and Pippin also throws stones

at Orcs, their aims true.]

Yes!

A hit. A fine hit!

[Two Ents rock a wooden structure and

push it over into the caverns below,

smashing against the rock. Some Orcs

fire flamed-tipped arrows at an Ent,

setting him on fire. Saruman continues

to look about from his balcony, helpless.

Some Ents are now breaking away at a

dam.]

Break the dam! Release the river!

[The dam is broken and Saruman looks

up to see the river rushing down the

slope towards Isengard, washing away

Orcs and wooden structures in its path.

]

Pippin, hold on! [The hobbits tighten

their hold on top of Treebeard]

Hold on, little hobbits!

[Treebeard braces himself against the

flood. As the water rushes over Isengard,

an Ent rushes in and thrusts his burning

body into the water. The water rushes

into the caverns, washing away the bridges,

mechanisms and structures within.]

[Frodo walks slowly away from the safe

corner. Gondorian Rangers are still

running about, defending their stations.]

What are you doing? Where are you going?!

Frodo walks up some stairs and stands

on a bridge. A Nazgul on a Fell beast

emerges in front of him. Frodo stares

at the Nazgul, fixated. Feeling the

call of the Ring, he holds it up. Faramir

watches the unfolding tableau from below.

As Frodo moves to put the Ring on his

finger and the Nazgul flies closer and

closer, Sam runs up and knocks Frodo

over. Faramir releases an arrow and

shoots the Fell Beast. Frodo and Sam

roll down the stairs. As they come to

a stop at the bottom, Frodo holds Sam

in a death grip, yells and points Sting

at his throat, his eyes livid with madness

and anger that someone would try to

take the Ring away.]

Aaarrgghh!!!

[With tears running down his face] Its

me. Its your Sam. Dont you know your

Sam?

[The madness fades and recognition returns

to Frodos eyes. He realises what he

nearly did and is overcome. Stumbling

backwards, he collapses against a wall

and Sting falls to the ground with a

clang. Sam gets up slowly.]

[Slowly and with despair] I cant do

this, Sam.

[Getting up slowly] I know. Its all

wrong. By rights we shouldnt even be

here. But we are. [He stands and leans

against a wall, looking out into the

distance.] Its like in the great stories,

Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered.

Full of darkness and danger they were.

And sometimes you didnt want to know

the end. Because how could the end be

happy? [Images of the riders winning

the battle against the Uruk-hai at Helms

Deep] How could the world go back to

the way it was when so much bad had

happened?

Victory! We have victory! [He raises

his sword with a victorious cry]

But in the end, its only a passing

thing, this shadow. [The women and children

welcome the men as they return. Eowyn

runs up to Aragorn and embraces him,

crying tears of relief.] Even darkness

must pass. A new day will come. [Isengard

is flooded. Merry and Pippin looks on

from their perch on Treebeard. On the

balcony, Saruman stumbles back into

his chamber] And when the sun shines

it will shine out the clearer. Those

were the stories that stayed with you.

That meant something, even if you were

too small to understand why. But I think,

Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now.

Folk in those stories had lots of chances

of turning back only they didnt. They

kept going because they were holding

on to something.

What are we holding on to, Sam?

Theres some good in this world, Mr.

Frodo. And its worth fighting for.

[Standing in a corner, even Gollum seems

moved. Faramir walks over and comes

to kneel in front of Frodo]

I think at last we understand one another,

Frodo Baggins.

You know the laws of our country, the

laws of your father. If you let them

go, your life will be forfeit.

Then it is forfeit. Release them.

[Sam shakes the rangers hand from his

shoulder. Frodo looks up at Faramir

with gladness. Over in the realm of

Rohan, Gandalf, Theoden and company

ride to the top of a slope, looking

towards the Mountain of Fire in the

distance.]

Saurons wrath will be terrible, his

retribution swift. The battle for Helms

Deep is over. The battle for Middle-earth

is about to begin. All our hopes now

lie with two little hobbits. Somewhere

in the wilderness.

[Frodo and Sam are walking through the

woods, away from Osgiliath.]

I wonder if well ever be put into songs

or tales.

What?

I wonder if people will ever say, lets

hear about Frodo and the Ring. And

theyll say yes, thats one of my favorite

stories. Frodo was really courageous,

wasnt he, dad. Yes, my boy, the most

famousest of hobbits. And thats saying

alot.

Huh, you left out one of the chief characters

more about Sam.

[Frodo turns to look at Sam.]

Frodo wouldnt have got far without

Sam.

Now Mr. Frodo, you shouldnt make fun.

I was being serious.

[smiling] So was I. [He turns to walk

on]

[Dreamily] Samwise the Brave. [He gives

his backpack a heave and follows Frodo]

[Gollum is crouching a short distance

away]

Smeagol!

Were not gonna wait for you. Come on!

Master... Master looks after us. Master

wouldnt hurt us.

Master broke his promise.

Dont ask Smeagol. Poor, poor Smeagol.

Master betrayed us! Wicked, tricksy,

false. We ought to wring his filthy

little neck. [Twists the branch of a

tree] Kill him! Kill him! Kill them

both. And then we take the precious

and we be the master.

[Scuttles and hides behind a tree] The

fat hobbit, he knows. Eyes always watching.

Then we stabs them out. Put out his

eyeses. And make HIM crawl.

[Bites on his finger and nods eagerly]

Yes! Yes! Yes!

Kill them both.

Yes! No no! [Backs away against a tree]

Its too risky, its too risky.

[He looks in the direction of the hobbits]

Wheres he gone? Hey Gollum, where are

you?

Smeagol?

[Softly and sinisterly] We could let

HER do it.

Yes. She could do it.

Yes, precious she could. And then we

takes it once theyre dead.

Once theyre dead...

Shh... [He pops out from hiding in front

of the hobbits.]

Come on, hobbits. Long ways to go yet.

Smeagol will show you the way.

[He turns to walk on, with Frodo and

Sam following behind.]

Follow me.

[ Camera pans up over the forest and

Ephel Duath to reveal the desolation

of Mordor. To the left of the frame

is the glowing Eye of Sauron atop Barad-dur,

and to the right of the frame is the

fiery Mount Doom. Three Fell Beasts

circle the dark skies. Lightning flashes

as the scene fades to black.]
