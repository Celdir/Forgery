Revised 10/10/95

BEGIN MAIN 'TITLE SEQUENCE:

An impressionistic montage:

A SILHOUETTED MAN in front of mirror dons his Marine dress blues.  Spit

polish shoes laced.  Medals clipped to jacket.  All in CLOSE-UP.  We

never see him fully.

The Man puts HIS HAT squarely on his head.  EYES glint.

On the man's dresser: MARINE MEMORABILIA.  Three Purple Hearts, photos

of a WOMAN (his wife), PHOTOS OF MARINES in combat locales.  TIGHTER

into the photos, we HEAR PANICKED VOICES, EXPLOSIONS, NOISES OF BRUTAL

COMBAT.

IMAGES: Through smoke, a desperate MARINE PRIVATE who knows he will

never be rescued... TWO MARINES walk up to a farmhouse door; through the

screen we see a MOTHER AND DAUGHTER who know what the news will be...

IMAGES: A MARINE COLOUR GUARD carries a COFFIN...  Now we are the coffin

as a FLAG drapes down on us. placed into a YOUNG WOMAN'S HAND.

Now we're in ARLINGTON CEMETERY.  Images of the cemetery are reflected

in wet puddles, as the SPIT-SHINED SHOES walk past images of the TOMB OF

THE UNKNOWN SOLDIER a ROW OF GRAVES comes into focus

A1G CLOSE-UP on the MARINE'S HAT, and his EYES.  Suddenly AN EXPLOSION

and we see --

A MARINE in a jungle, radioing for help: ,You gotta get us outta here

sir, Jesus, they're all over us... ! And an' EXPLOSION ends the

communication ...

AII  CLOSE-UP on the MARINE'S EYES and FADE IN:

EXT.  ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY - MORNING

Two groundskeepers on "ride 'em" lawn mowers, BENNIE and MARLIN, smoke

Camels and watch the MARINE OFFICER from the opening montage.  He's

alone, across the cemetery.

ACROSS THE CEMETERY

Brig.  Gen.  FRANCIS XAVIER HUMMEL stands before a headstone: BARBARA

MCLEAN HUMMEL 1946-1996.

Hummel puts new flowers on the grave.  Walks off.

EXT.  ACCESS ROAD TO ARMY WEAPONS COMPOUND - NIGHT

Heavy rain.  A road next to a heavily guarded bunker facility.  A canvas

FOUR MARINES in black suits dive through a hole in the truckbed floor

into a MANHOLE IN THE ROAD.

EXT.  ARMY WEAPONS COMPOUND - FRONT GATE - NIGHT

Three ARMY M.P.s at the front GUARDHOUSE.  GENERAL HUMMEL pulls up in a

SUBURBAN.  The M.P.s immediately recognise him and stand more rigidly.

The M.P. waves Hummel in, saluting crisply.

INT.  GRATED STORM DRAIN IN BUNKER COMPOUND - NIGHT

The four marines from the truck are waiting, readying arms.  The leader

is looking at his watch.  Gives a hand signal to the others, and up they

go --

EXT.  BUNKER COMPOUND - NIGHT

The four marines emerge from the storm drain and move toward covered

positions in the compound.

200 YARDS AWAY - TWO ARMY "MAGAZINE CHECKERS" emerge from a building

with clipboards, on routine check.

INT.  BUNKER SECURITY BUILDING - NIGHT

The Army M.P.s escort General Hummel inside.  THREE ARMY GUARDS spring

up from their SURVEILLANCE MONITORS.  Everyone's nervous, in awe, rigid

at attention.  COLONEL CALLAHAN emerges from an adjacent room,

sleepy-eyed.

EXT.  BUNKER COMPOUND - WATCH TOWER - NIGHT

Two marines position themselves outside the door to the bunker

compound's elevated watch tower.

...EXT.  BUNKER COMPOUND - NIGHT

Below the watch tower, the ARMY MAGAZINE CHECKERS approach.  Marines 1

Marines 1 and 2, now in MAGAZINE CHECYERIS UNIFORMS, move to the BUNKER

DOOR.  They open the door with the Magazine checker's CODED CARDS.

INT.  CHEMICAL WEAPONS BUNKER - NIGHT

Two ARMY GUARDS, playing poker, look up at the entering marines.

Marines 1 and 2 walk straight up to the Army Guards, holding them at bay

with M-16s.  Before any words are spoken, one of the marines injects

each of the guards with a VACCINE PISTOL.

INT.  BUNKER SECURITY BUILDING - NIGHT

Four more marines led by SGT.  CRISP enter, holding Col. Callahan,

General Hummel and the Army Guards at bay.

the room.

EXT.  ARMY WEAPONS COMPOUND - FRONT GATE - NIGHT

The gate swings open.  TWO HUMVEES enter the compound.

EXT.  CHEMICAL WEAPONS BUNKER - NIGHT

The marines use a 'rabbit tool, (hydraulic, compact and powerful) to pry

CHEMICAL WEAPONS BUNKER - INTERIOR HALLWAY - The marines rush up to

another steel door and quickly pry it open.

INT.  C.B.W. BUNKER - NIGHT

A refrigerated storage room for chemical weapons.  Storage tubes are

labelled: V.X. POISON GAS.  Across the room are rockets labelled: 55 115

MM BOLT ROCKETS.

Using the TRACK HOOK SYSTEM in the bunker's ceiling, the marines move

the V.X. CHEM ROUNDS and BOLT ROCKETS to the waiting humvees.  It's very

fast, like clockwork.

EXT.  ARMY WEAPONS COMPOLIND - FRONT GATE - NIGHT

The Humvees, followed by Hummel in his Suburban, roar out of the

Establish headquarters for chemical/biological weapons.

INT.  F.B.I. OFFICE - CHEMICAL/BIOLOGIAL DIVISION - DAY

A WINDOWED DOOR stencilled "Chemical/Biological Weapons Division." A

RUBBER DART hits the glass and drops into A TRASH CAN next to the door.

ACROSS THE ROOM - BILL GOODSPEED, 30, and partner/trainee MARVIN

ISHERWOOD, 25, feet up on desks, with toy guns.  This is Man's Boredom.

A ceiling fan circles.  Isherwood yawns; scratches neck with his gun

barrel.

GOODSPEED reloads.  Aims.  Fires.

THE DART hits A CARDBOARD TARGET across the room which activates a Rube

Goldberg series of events ending in a PLASTIC GIRL being ignited in a

PAN OF CHEMICALS.

GOODSPEED, without even getting up, casually sprays the pan with flame

retardant foam.

A KLAXON sounds.  Isherwood smiles excitedly.

INT.  F.B.I. CHEMICAL WEAPONS - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY

Isherwood follows Goodspeed down a grimy, off-white corridor illuminated

by antiseptic light.  This is an older building.  Hasn't been

refurbished and shows it.

INT.  F.B.I. CHEMICAL WEAPONS - LABORATORY - DAY

A medium-sized laboratory, where 5 F.B.I. TECHNICIANS are bent over

tables of beakers, test-tubes, Bunsen burners, etc.  The room and

equipment are old and used; could be 1976 rather than 1996.

Along one side of the lab is a plexi-glass wall. Inside the plexi-glass

is an airlocked GAS CHAMBER. F.B.I chemists LONNER and LING motion to

Goodspeed.

INSIDE THE GAS CHAMBER - is a LARGE WOODEN CRATE next to a TABLE OF

POISON DETECTION INSTRUMENTS.

Isherwood does so.  It's shaky.

Hold on Goodspeed's uncertain look, and CUT TO:

INT.  GAS C ER - DAY - MINUTES LATER The door HISSES open.  Goodspeed

and Isherwood, in vulcanized rubber suits and visored helmets, enter.

They go to the INSTRUMENT TABLE before the crate.

A GLASS VESSEL with tiny air holes (like a salt shaker) descends from

the ceiling.  Inside are COCKROACHES. .

Goodspeed grabs a pry-bar from the instrument table-and slowly pries

open the cratels wooden lid.  He motions to Isherwood.  Together they

gingerly lift the lid.

INSIDE THE CRATE - it's filled with "UNICEF" type stuff. Goodspeed lifts

out a HOT-PLATE.  Isherwood lifts out an EGG BEATER.  Gocidspeed runs a

POISON SENSOR past each.

Isherwood lifts out a DOLL.  Goodspeed's POISON SENSOR'S NEEDLE goes

crazy... !

The doll's eyes open.  Its mouth blast a PINKISH SPRAY, hitting

Goodspeed's forearm and Isherwood's palm.

OUTSIDE THE GAS CHAMBER - DR.  LING stabs a button marked "exhaust" and

another marked "emergency."

A KLAXON sounds.  F.B.I. TECHNICIANS race for the exit.

IN THE GAS CHAMBER - The pinkish gas hovers in the air. CEILING EXHAUST

FANS begin to suck it up.

IN THE GLASS VESSEL - The cockroaches convulse, flip in the air and

explode, guts splattering the vessel walls.

DR. LING looks at a DIGITAL CLOCK on the control panel.

Goodspeed grabs the doll from Isherwood, slams it on the table, and

grabs A SCALPEL.  Cuts open the doll's chest.

ISHERWOOD looks at his RUBBER GLOVES.  The rubber is beginning to bubble

and corrode.

GOODSPEED peels back the doll's plastic chest, revealing: a C-4

EXPLOSIVE DEVICE and TEN POISON AMPULES.

Isherwood's and Goodspeed's rubber gloves are melting.

Dr. Lonner flips on the sprinklers.  The pipes KNOCK.  A FEW PATHETIC

DROPS trickle from the SPRINKLER HEADS.

Isherwood, terrified, jerks open an OVERHEAD CABINET, revealing several

6 inch needled SYRINGES.

Isherwood fumbles with a huge syringe.

The pipes are KNOCKING, now they're COUGHING.

ISHERWOOD sinks to his knees, holding the huge syringe in front of his

heart, hari-kari style, hands trembling ...

GOODSPEED concentrates on the device; his calm is unsettling.  His hands

flash, grabbing instruments and performing precise, deft, functions.  He

snips a wire and splices it.  Another.  Another.

Isherwood moves the syringe closer to his chest.

ISHERWOOD drops the syringe.  Fumbles for another... GOODSPEED,

ice-cold, continues on the device ...

GOODSPEEDIS RUBBER GLOVE is stretched to transparency. we see

GOODSPEED'S FLESH through the acid-eaten rubber.  He makes one final

cut-and-clamp.  THE DETONATOR on the poison gas turns off.

OUTSIDE THE GAS CHAMBER - GREEN LIGRTS FLASR on the control panel and A

TORRENTIAL SPRAY soaks GOODSPEED AND ISRERWOOD.  Isherwood is wide-eyed

and trembling.  Goodspeed glares at him.

EXT.  GEORGETOWN - STREETS/ALLEYWAY - DAY

The bohemian part around Georgetown U. Goodspeed heads down an alley

between two townhouses.  LOUD COUNTRY MUSIC emanates from an apt. above.

Goodspeed ascends.

INT.  GEORGETOWN - GOODSPEED'S APARTMENT - DAY

A young woman stands in the middle of the living room, belting out a

Carlene Carter tune in cowboy boots, rhinestone blouse and skirt.  CARLA

PESTALOZZI, 20's, is playing guitar, accompanied by a boom box.

Goodspeed walks past her into the kitchen.  Carla turns down the music.

Goodspeed re-enters with a Budweiser.

Goodspeed sits heavily on the couch.  Rubs his temples.

Carla changes the c.d.: A PUCCINI OPERA plays.

She holds Up a positive home pregnancy test and CUT TO:

Baxter draws a .45 and places it to Ranger ioe's head.

Startled, Park Ranger Joe backs into a cell.  Baxter grabs the cell door

open/shut lever and yanks it.  The cell doors CLANG shut.  Hummel,

Baxter and the others walk off.

Force General PETERSON, and C.I.A. Director MILTON AMWAY.

ON THE SCREEN - A YOUNGER HUMMEL in Vietnam.

MORE SLIDES OF HUMMEL in various international theaters.

The door opens.  A NAVAL ATTACHE pokes his head in.

INTERCUT - PENTAGON and ALCATRAZ as necessary.

There is a pause.

Everyone stares at sinclair.

Sinclair's irritation is relieved by the Naval Attache, entering again,

who hands him a phone and whispers:

Sinclair walks to the far corner of the room with the phone, speaking

sotto voice.

General Kramer, embarrassed, nods yes.

Hayden Sinclair returns to the table.

EXT.  GOODSPEED'S HOUSE - ROOFTOP - NIGHT Tarpaper and gravel roof.

athletically fucking.  Standing up.  They both have robes on.  A

CORDLESS PHONE RINGS.  Again.

look before ...

She turns away from him.  He pulls her back...

GOODSPEED walks off in COWBOY BOOTS, robe and boxers,..

INT.  PENTAGON - SITUATION ROOM - NIGHT U.S.N. commander CHARLES

ANDERSON, 35, just the hardest looking man you've ever seen, stands

before the group.  Anderson is a Navy S.E.A.L., an Incursion Team

Leader.  Before Anderson are AERIAL RECON PHOTOS of Alcatraz.

CAMERA FOCUSES ON F.B.I. Director Womack, who gives a very significant

look to C.I.A. Director AMWAY.

F.B.I. Director trades a very significant look with C.I.A. Director

AMWAY.  Amway clears his throat.  He is older, very old school.

Everyone turns to him.

Womack and Amway rise and exit together.  Everyone else sits there,

confused.

INT.  PENTAGON - CORRIDOR - NIGHT Womack and Amway exit into the

corridor.  They huddle tightly against the wall.  Sotto voice:      -

INT.  WOLFBURG PENITENTIARY - CELL BLOCK - NIGHT A long row of cells.

CAMERA slowly DOLLIES past cell after cell.  Sullen INMATES stare

blankly at us ...

CAMERA moves through a door marked "ISOLATION." At the end of a gloomy

corridor is a CAST-IRON DOOR.

BACK TO THE PENTAGON CORRIDOR

BACK TO WOLFBURG - IN THE ISOLATION CELL

TWO FEDERAL MARSHALS open the cell.'s steel locking bar.  They push open

the door.  Dark inside.  A MAN sits on the bed.

A SHAFT OF LIGHT cuts across the cell floor.

THE SHAFT OF LIGHT slices the face of JOHN PAUL MASON.  He is British,

at least once was, imprisoned without trial for 33 years on U.S. soil.

For now, we have no idea why.

get out, go inside.

INT.  F.B.I. - OBSERVATION ROOM - MORNING

We watch MASON being led into an INTERROGATION ROOM, his legs in irons,

his hands cuffed behind him.

'We are watching through a TWO-WAY MIRROR, and WIDEN TO: Womack,

Goodspeed, Reynolds and ERNEST SANCHEZ, S.F. Bureau Agent in Charge, are

watching Mason.  Sanchez is a gruff guy with the subtlety of a heart

attack.

Sanchez exits.

IN THE INTERROGATION ROOM - MASON looks around.  He focuses on the

mirror.  He stares right through at GoodsDeed. GOODSPEED is fascinated,

unnerved.

INT.  F.B.I. - INTERROGATION ROOM - MORNING Sanchez walks in, sipping

coffee.  Mason sits there, eyes forward.

Sanches sits.  Mason stares at the table.

A pause.  Sanchez glares at Mason.

The word "Alcatraz" registers with Mason.

SANCHEZ draws a blank on Solzhenitsyn.

MASON  turns away.  As if SANCHEZ

no longer exists. Suddenly, over a

wall-mounted INTERCOM:

SANCHEZ tosses a quarter on the desk and exits.

IN THE OBSERVATION ROOM

GOODSPEED takes the pardon, goes for the door.

THE INTERROGATION ROOM

GOODSPEED enters.  He's completely out of his element, has no idea what

he's doing, and is-suddenly face-to-face with this.... MASON creature.

The two men regard each other.

The Marshal uncuffs Mason's wrists.  MASON rubs his wrists, staring now

at Goodspeed.

So much for Goodspeed's confidence.

He slides a ballpoint pen across to Mason.  MASON looks at the pen, then

Goodspeed.

IN THE OBSERVATION ROOM

IN THE INTERROGATION ROOM

MASON registers this information.... 73 IN THE OBSERVATION ROOM F.B.I.

DIRECTOR WOMACK Stupid, stupid, stupid ....

IN THE INTERROGATION ROOM MASON

stares at the pardon contract, thinking.

IN THE OBSERVATION ROOM

IN THE INTERROGATION ROOM

MASON thinks.  He picks up the pen.

With that MASON picks up the pen and signs the pardon contract.  He

hands it to Goodspeed, who exits.

MASON turns toward the mirror, staring right through.

INT.  F.B.I. ~ OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY SANCHEZ

and GOODSPEED enter.

GOODSPEED hands U.S. ATTORNEY REYNOLDS the signed pardon contract.

Reynolds reluctantly hands the pardon to Womack.

SANCHEZ leads the perturbed Reynolds out. GOODSPEED

and Womack are alone now.  And WOMACK tears up the pardon

Over WOMACK'S SHOULDER, GOODSPEED

WATCHES AS --

IN THE INTERROGATION ROOM - MASON

places THE QUARTER on the floor.  He raises his metal chair; SLAMS it

down on the quarter.

Sir, those references to Alchimadus, Beckett, Solzhenitsyn:

all had something in common.

IN THE INTERROGATION ROOM - MASON

picks up the coin.  It has a DEEP BURR

in it.  He moves to the mirror; begins carving into the glass.

GOODSPEED watches MASON over Womack's shoulder.

MASON has etched a circle in the mirror.  He slams his elbow against it.

The glass caves in, CRASHES to the floor.

GOODSPEED and Womack whirl around, startled.  MASON

leans into the observation room.

MASON and Womack stare at each other and CUT TO:

EXT.  MOJAVE - DESERT FLATS - MORNING A hot desert-vista.  Miles of

nowhere.  A DODGE sits under a tripod.  Suspended from the tripod, a

BLINKING DEVICE.

The device DETONATES, showering the car with WHITE HOT BURNING LIQUID

and amazingly, the car melts into a pool of molten steel, disintegrating

to ash, which blows across the desert.

50 YARDS AWAY - U.S.A.F. LT.  JIMMY FISK and CPT.  LARRY GILER (both

late 20's) emerge from the heat waves in heat-refletive suits, walking

toward A HEAT PROTECTIVE BUNKER (a wall coated with heat reflective

metal.)

BEHIND THE BUNKER U.S.A.F. General Peterson watches with other Air Force

OFFICERS and TECHNICIANS.

Fisk and Giler enter, pulling off their suit hoods.  Their faces are

beet red from the heat.

General Peterson walks off.

The van STOPS: the rear doors open to the FAIRMONT HOTEL SERVICE

ENTRANCE.

INT.  FAIRMONT HOTEL - PENTHOUSE SUITE - DAY Top floor suite with a

private elevator.  Grand, with French doors leading to a balcony.

Director Womack, GOODSPEED

and F.B.I.Agents Star and Hunt are in the

room.  Jackets off, shoulder holsters on.

IN THE SUITE'S BATHROOM

Steamy, from the shower.  F.B.I. Agent Cord sits on the sink.  MASON'S

VOICE emanates from the shower.  He's singing some ditty off-key.  But

MASON isn't washing.

INSIDE THE SHOWER STALL -- Mason's tampering with the BELL HOUSING of

THE RETRACTABLE CLOTHESLINE on the shower wall.

MASON pops off the bell-housing. he pulls out the nylon clothesline cord

(it's thick, about 10 ft.) and rips it from the bell housing.  Tests its

strength.

Satisfied, he knots A NOOSE on one end of the clothesline cord, then

coils.

IN THE BATHROOM - MASON

emerges from the shower wearing a huge hotel

bathrobe.

Cord hands him a SUIT OF CLOTHES.  MASON

inspects them.

IN THE SUITE'S LIVING ROOM Womack is dumping the contents of a BARBER'S

BAG on the sideboard.

Hands THE HOTEL BARBER, a swishy guy, a COMB, ELECTRIC TRIMMER and BIB.

The BARBER frowns.

MASON, dressed, emerges from the bathroom.  Motions the barber toward

the balcony.

The barber gulps.  Follows MASON onto the balcony.

ON THE SUITE'S BALCONY MASON

sits in the sun on a balcony chair.  Bib

on.

The barber begins trimming Mason's hair...

THE BALCONY - SOME MINUTES LATER Mason's hair and beard are neatly

trimmed.  The barber holds a mirror up; MASON

examines himself.

The barber stands.  Clears his throat.  Rubs his thumb and forefinger

together.

Agent Star, glaring at Mason, leads the Barber out.

MASON extends his hand.  Womack looks at it.  As Womack reluctantly

takes Mason's hand, MASON slides the noose over Womack's wrist.  He

yanks it tight and shoulders director womack bodily over the balustrade.

Womack plunges, HOWLING, 9 stories to his death.  No, he only falls 10

feet.  SPROOOOOING he stops, hanging by his wrist off the side of the

building, held there by --

-- MASON

on the balcony, clutching the other end of the nylon

clothesline, staring at Goodspeed.

GOODSPEED fumbles for his gun.  Finally unholsters it. DIRECTOR WOMACK,

hanging below, is SCREAMING.

EXT.  FAIRMONT HOTEL - ACROSS THE STREET - DAY Two F.B.I. AGENTS,

loitering by their vehicle, look up at WOMACK, dangling off the side of

the building.

BUSBOYS.  MASON moves toward the side exit.  Two F.B.I. AGENTS enter.

MASON ducks into the dishwashing room.  Waits for the Agents to run

past.

MASON emerges, running right into..... GOODSPEED.

WHAMM.  MASON'S FIST slams into Goodspeed's jaw. GOODSPEED

goes down on the huge dishwasher.  MASON moves off quickly toward the side exit.

EXT.  FAIRMONT HOTEL - SIDE EXIT - DAY

fast expensive European cars are waiting to be parked.  First in line,

however, is a HUMVEE.

EXT.  FAIRMONT HOTEL - SIDE EXIT - DAY

exits, looking at MASON getting into the HUMVEE. The Humvee

explodes out of the hotel driveway.

GOODSPEED shouts to the F.B.I. AGENTS across the street:

The F.B.I. SEDANS ROAR off after Mason.

GOODSPEED looks around.  A Ferrari sitting there. GOODSPEED

gets behind the wheel.

THE FERRARI blasts out of the driveway after the Humvee.

EXT.  SAN FRANCISCO - STREETS - DAY The HUMVEE lumbers up to a traffic

light.  Stops behind several vehicles ahead.

INT.  TUNNELS UNDER ALCATRAZ - NIGHT

MASON  and GOODSPEED as before.

MASON  advances.

GOODSPEED fiddles with the safety catch.  With a swipe, MASON

snatches the gun.  They glare at each other.

MASON walks off.  Suddenly stops.  THE SATCHEL EXPLOSIVE has fallen at

his feet.  MASON turns, looks at Goodspeed.  And they sprint back, the

way they came.

IN THE TUNNEL BEHIND THEM - A MONSTROUS EXPLOSION blows in the tunnel

and knocks MASON  and GOODSPEED to their feet.

INT.  ALCATRAZ - SHOWER ROOM - NIGHT

PVTS.  COX AND MCCOY attach a bundle of C-4 to A TANK OF GASOLINE and

INT.  TUNNELS UNDER ALCATRAZ

The gas bomb detonates, blowin'g a wall of flame through the tunnel.

The fire is looking for an escape, hunting and burning everything in its

path.

DOWN THE TUNNEL - MASON  AND GOODSPEED

see the wall of flame ROARING

toward them.  MASON

grabs Goodspeed.

They dive into a pool of stagnant water, submersing as the WALL OF FLAME

blows through the tunnel over their heads.

Mason, then Goodspeed, drags himself out of the water.

MASON  hurries off, GOODSPEED on his tail.

EXT.  ALCATRAZ - SUBTERRANEAN CIVIL WAR RUINS - NIGHT

The tunnel leads here, to the Civil war era dungeon.  The tunnel's

bricked up; brick and mortar circa 1855.

CIVIL WAR RUINS - NIGHT

Removes a brick. another.  Another.  A WHOLE CLUMP of bricks falls,

revealing A HOLE.

GOODSPEED follows MASON through the hole.

INT.  CIVIL WAR DUNGEON - OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL - NIGHT

MASON  and GOODSPEED emerge to a ledge which faces A POOL OF DANK STAGNANT WATER.

It's about 3 ft. deep.

MASON what did I do to deserve this?  What God did I offend .....

GOODSPEED begins to wade into the pool.

MASON

Stop.

(GOODSPEED stops)

There.  And there.

GOODSPEED squints.  The water slithers with COTTONMOUTHS. MASON

unpack the QUART OF MOTOR OIL in spray bottle.

The COTTONMOUTHS, repulsed by the oil, stay away. GOODSPEED

tries not to look at the snakes.  They make it across.

MASON slaps the .9 MM pistol into Goodspeed's hand walks off.

GOODSPEED follows.

INT.  ALCATRAZ - TUNNEL UNDER PRISON MORGUE - NIGHT

MASON  and GOODSPEED

arrive at a fork in the tunnel. _

DOWN THE FORK IN THE TUNNEL - is the PRISON MONO-RAIL SYSTEM: a single

rail suspended from the tunnel ceiling, upon which SMALL CARTS are

suspended.

MASON  nods.  Moves to a STEEL-RUNGED LADDER leading to a GARBAGE CHUTE

against the wall.  			GOODSPEED

follows.

INT.  ROOM ADJACENT TO MORGUE - NIGHT

MASON and GOODSPEED emerge from the garbage chute.  They hear VOICES in

the next room.

INT.  MORGUE - NIGHT

PVTS.  GAMBLE and STARLING are guarding the poison. Starling's walking

around.  Gamble's seated on a MORTICIANIS TABLE, smoking.

The door bursts open.  MASON stands in the doorway.  GAMBLE dives away.

STARLING whirls, raising his M-16.

MASON'S HAND flashes.  THE SAW-TOOTHED KNIFE flies the length of the

room and buries in Starling's neck.

Gamble fires from his position around the corner.  MASON and Goodspeed

dive for cover behind a cabinet. GOODSPEED fires from cover without

looking, his gun raised over the cabinet.  Mason, underneath the

cabinet, fires at GAMBLE'S FOOT.  Gamble, shot, hits the deck.

GAMBLE unclips a GRENADE.  Before he can pull the pin....

MASON FIRES HIS CLIP EMPTY at the AIR CONDITIONER MOUNT on the ceiling

above Gamble.  The mount gives; the ENORMOUS AIR CONDITIONER falls,

crushing Gamble.  Gamble's GRENADE, still secured with the pin, rolls

away.

GOODSPEED rises.  Looks at Gamble under the air conditioner.  Just HIS

LEGS stick out. (Note: the rest of the scene's action plays out around

Gamble's legs.

GOODSPEED opens the CORPSE DRAWERS revealing the V.X-. CHEM ROUNDS

(shaped like big tennis ball cans).

GOODSPEED carefully lifts out a chem round.  MASON

grabs one, accidentally knocking it against the drawer.

GOODSPEED and MASON set the V.X. chem rounds on the mortician's table. GOODSPEED

pulls out his EQUIPMENT KIT.  Begins detaching the tops of the

chem rounds.

GOODSPEED reaches inside a chem round and carefully pulls out..... a

STRAND OF V.X. POISON PEARLS: ping-pong ball sized glass bubbles filled

with poison.

GOODSPEED

hands the poison pearl strand to Mason.  MASON  holds it like a string

of wind chimes.

MASON stares uneasily at the pearl strands.

GOODSPEED  has the chem round's GUIDANCE SYSTEMS exposed.  Inside are

tiny GUIDANCE SYSTEM MICRO-CHIPS. GOODSPEED

plucks the chip from each chem round and pockets it.

GOODSPEED

moves on to the third and fourth chem rounds. Suddenly there's

a BEEP. GOODSPEED and MASON whirl.  Pvt. Gamble's WALKIE TALKIE is

talking to them:

MASON and GOODSPEED exchange a nervous look.

EXT.  ALCATRAZ - INFIRMARY COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT

Hummel clicks off his walkie-talkie.  Stands there a second, thinking.

INT.  ALCATRAZ - MORGUE - NIGHT

GOODSPEED goes faster; his hands are

sweating, trembling.  It's like he's lost his spine.

(And thinking about Carla, perhaps he has.)

GOODSPEED nearly drops a chem round.  MASON

recoils.

EXT.  ALCATRAZ - BETWEEN CELL HOUSE AND MORGUE - NIGHT

Hummel and his men race toward the morgue.

INT.  ALCATRAZ - MORGUE - NIGHT

GOODSPEED  has dealt with eight chem

rounds.  There should be seven more, but there's not. GOODSPEED

counts them ....

MASON raises the poison pearl strands from each of the remaining four

chem rounds. GOODSPEED quickly plucks the chips from the guidance

systems.

EXT.  ALCATRAZ - MORGUE - NIGHT

Hummel and the marines converge on the morgue.  Surround the door.  They

burst inside, guns trained.

INT.  ALCATRAZ - MORGUE - NIGHT

leaving the tac radio behind ....

INT.  TUNNEL UNDER MORGUE - NIGHT

GOODSPEED and MASON tumble out of the chute.  Two MONO-RAIL CARTS are

hanging there.  They exchange a look and climb into the first cart.

MASON throws the cart's RELEASE LEVER.  The cart glides down the

mono-rail.

INT.  ALCATRAZ - MORGUE - NIGHT

HUMMEL goes to the mortician's table.  Sees the theft of the guidance chips.

Hendrix gets in THE SECOND MONO-RAIL CART.  Scarpetti gets in THE THIRD

MONO-RAIL CART.  Hendrix and Scarpetti pull the release levers.  The

Mono-rail carts rumble after GOODSPEED

INT.  ALCATRAZ - MONO-RAIL TUNNEL - NIGHT The three carts fly down the

mono-rail: GOODSPEED and MASON

(in CART 1) 50 feet ahead of Scarpetti

(in CART 2), who is 50 feet ahead of Hendrix (in CART 3)

THE GRENADE PROJECTILE shoots down the monorail tunnel.

IN CART 1 - MASON  AND GOODSPEED

duck as the GRENADE PROJECTILE wings

over their heads, continues down the tunnel

and DETONATES against the tunnel wall.

CART 1 roars through smoke and debris left by grenade explosion.  As it

rounds a corner, MASON

grabs A SPLINTERED TIMBER and releases from the

cart.  CART 1, with GOODSPEED

alone continues down the mono-rail.

MASON  yanks down a 5 ft. long BROKEN SECTION OF SEWAGE PIPE and presses

himself against the tunnel wall.

AS CART 2 rounds the corner...

WHAM!!  MASON  swings, hitting Scarpetti flush in the forehead, killing

him and blowing him off the cart.  Cart 2, without Scarpetti, continues

down the mono-rail.

MASON  waits.  As CART 3 rounds the corner

MASON  swings again But Hendrix is waiting for it. Hendrix grabs the

swinging pipe and pulls MASON

into Cart 3!

IN CART 3 - HENDRIX AND MASON

FIGHT SCENE

Mason's sprawled on the floor of the cart.  Hendrix levels his M-16.

MASON whipsaws the legs under Hendrix, bowling him over, the M-16

falling away from the cart.

MASON and Hendrix get to their feet.. They trade blow after blow as the

Cart ROARS through the tunnel.

IN CART 1 ~ GOODSPEED

looks over his shoulder at MASON

and Hendrix locked in mortal combat.  He pulls the CART BRAKE.  Cart 1 begins

slowing down.  CART 2 (Scarpettils) rams into it. Now Carts 1 and 2 are

together.  And on comes --

CART 3 - Hendrix knocks MASON

to the floor of the cart.  Hendrix dives

atop Mason, strangling him. mason's head is bent over the front lip of

the cart.  MASON looks down the mono-rail track.  To his horror he sees

CARTS 1 and 2 slowing down ...

IN CART 1 - 			GOODSPEED

realizes that his cart is going to ram Mason's

outstretched head.  He releases the brake, and Cart 1 picks up speed ...

IN CART 3 - Hendrix draws the knife.  Hendrix raises the knife.  With

his last strength, MASON rolls away.  Hendrix plunges the knife down,

missing Mason, him momentum carrying his head and shoulders over the

front lip of the cart.  MASON SCREAMS at Goodspeed.

IN CART 1 - GOODSPEED

pulls the cart brake and --

-- CART 3 SLAMS into CARTS 1 and 2 at 20 m.p.h., crushing Hendrixls head

and torso between Carts 2 and 3.

The collision knocks MASON

off Cart 3, SLAMMING his head against the

tunnel wall.  MASON  falls unconscious.to the tunnel floor, while --

-- CART 1 is shoved by the collision across.a DITCH OF WATER in the

tunnel floor. GOODSPEED

groggily gets to his feet. Jumps down from the cart.

In the midst of this PVT.  ROYCE

runs up.  Sees MASON concussed,

helpless.  Royce draws his GLINTING KNIFE.  Kneels over Mason.  He's

going to cut his throat.

Royce lowers the knife.  Looks across the ditch at Goodspeed.  The ditch

is 20 ft. wide and filled with dank, stagnant water and we've seen dank,

stagnant water before.

And ROYCE begins to wade into the ditch.  And GOODSPEED

is looking at the water, waiting... ROYCE is waist deep now.

Royce feels something. He winces.  Looks down at --

FIVE COTTONMOUTH SNAKES, fangs wide and white, plunging into him.  Royce

screams.  His knees buckle.  He falls to his knees in the water.  A

COTTONMOUTH stuck to his neck... Royce SHRIEKS again ...

And slides gently under the water.

Goodspeed, hand over hand on the monorail, eases the cart across the

stagnant ditch.  Hops out.  MASON gets to his feet.  The two exchange a look.

It's all I could think of.

They stumble off down the mono-rail tunnel.

GOODSPEED stares blankly into space.  INTERCUT between the two cells

again.

MASON  rises.  Lifts the bed.  Pulls off the bed's heavy ROLLING CASTER.

Knots the caster onto one end of the braided rope.

MASON leans out his cell and tosses the rolling caster down the cell

block.  The braided rope, tied to it, plays out to it's full length.

The result: the braided rope lies across the cell block floor, the

rolling caster tied to it.  MASON  holds the other end of the rope

through the bars of his cell.

MASON

fiercely yanks the rope toward him.  The heavy rolling caster

jerks from the floor.  The CASTER, pulling the rope, flies past Mason's

cell --

-- shooting in an arc around the corner of the cell block, still pulling

the rope, where --

-- the caster-pulled ROPE catches the CELL RELEASE LEVER against the

wall.  The rope coils, WRAP WRAP WHAP, around the release lever handle.

MASON

tugs the rope taut like he's just snagged a fish. Then he pulls

slowly and delicately.

bead on GOODSPEED

awaiting death.

in Fryels mouth.  Fryels eyes widen.  GREY SMOKE SPEWS FROM HIS MOUTH

AND NOSTRILS.  His eyes bulge.

close.  Frye open his mouth, spewing forth a CLOUD OF POISON in

Goodspeed's face.

GOODSPEED shoves Frye away.  Frye drops, his body quivering.  Blood

pours form his ears and nose.  Frye spasms in a sickening dance of

death.

GOODSPEED reels away,.  COUGHING.  Dizzy, he falls to his knees.  He's

gassed and knows it.  Desperately, he rips at his PANDLEG.  A SYRINGE

taped to his calf.  ATROPINE.

needle into his chest.  Into his heart.  Depresses the plunger.
