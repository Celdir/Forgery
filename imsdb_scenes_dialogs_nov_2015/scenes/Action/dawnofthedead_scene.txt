quiet at first, as credits appear. The woman's face begins to

twitch, as though she is having a bad dream. She moans slightly

and her expression grows more desperate.

A mix of subtle sounds begin to fade in. As they get louder, we

can discern what sounds like a busy office area. It is actually

a frantic television studio with the hum of panic in a national

emergency.

The woman's moans get louder and more desperate as the

background sounds reach full volume and the credits stop. The

woman sits up, snapping awake.

Francine, twenty three years old and very attractive, although

she is gritty with dirt. Her hair is hanging, dishevelled and

sweaty. Her jeans and blouse have been worn for several days.

She is sitting on the floor, where she has slept the last

several hours, covered by an old overcoat.

Tony:	YOU OK?

Fran stares at the young man. She is shaking. She doesn't speak.

Tony:	THE SHIT'S REALLY HITTING THE FAN.

The girl tries to clear her head as the young man moves on to

where others sleep on the floor. He wakes them up one at a time.

We begin to hear voices over the busy hum of the studio. They

have an electronic tinniness, as broadcast over a monitor. Fran

looks about. She is still shaken from her dream.

Everybody looks dishevelled and exhausted. Technicians man

monitors, and we see people on the little screens, arguing

emotionally.

Voice:	YES, BUT THAT'S...

Voice:	THAT'S A WHOLE OTHER STUDY. THEY'RE TRYING...

Voice:	BUT IF WE KNEW THAT, WE COULD...

Voice:	WE DON'T KNOW THAT! WE DON'T KNOW THAT!

organise the stacks of bulletins as they arrive. Others trip

over cables and generally get in each other's way.

Man's voice: I'M STILL DREAMING.

Fran turns her head. Another young man sits next to her on the

floor. He is one of the ones Tony awakened.

Fran:	NO YOU'RE NOT.

Woman:	MY TURN WITH THE COAT.

Fran looks up. A young woman is offering her coffee in a paper

cup. She is next in line for the overcoat and a few hours sleep.

Fran takes the coffee and struggles to her feet.

Woman:	THE GUYS ON THE CREW ARE GETTING CRAZY.

at the end of their ropes.

Technicians: (all at once)

Technicians: WE GOT A REPORT THAT HALF THOSE RESCUE

Fran focuses on the monitors. She is incredulous... stunned by

the madness which surrounds her. She realises the hopelessness

of the situation as she zeroes in on the televised conversation.

on screen.

Fran:	RESCUE STATIONS?

Fran leafs through sheets of paper on Charlie's desk. He writes

notes as he listens on the receiver, and he speaks to the woman.

Charlie:	HALF THOSE ARE INOPERATIVE ANY MORE.

Fran:	THESE ARE RESCUE STATIONS. WE CAN'T SEND

Charlie:	(into receiver)

Charlie makes more notes and hands them to Fran. Still listening

on the receiver, he speaks to the woman again.

Charlie:	I'M DOIN' WHAT I CAN. THESE ARE DEFINITE

Fran snatches up the sheets and moves across the room.

Fran:	I'M GONNA KNOCK OFF THE OLD RESCUE STATIONS.

Fran reaches instinctively for the lapel of her blouse. Her

badge is missing.

Fran:	JESUS!

Man:	 SHE'S ALRIGHT.

She makes a move toward the corner where she was asleep.

She gives the rest of her coffee to the two men.

Fran:	NOT MUCH LEFT, BUT HAVE A BALL.

The two men each slug eagerly from the paper cup. Fran rushes

off toward a large teleprompter typing machine.

Givens:	 NOBODY HAS THE AUTHORITY TO DO THAT, I WANT...

Givens spots Fran as she moves into the room.

Givens:	 GARRET, WHO TOLD YOU TO KILL THE SUPERS?

Fran:	NOBODY. I KILLED 'EM. THEY'RE OUT OF DATE.

newsmen still earnestly try to perform their various functions,

but most of the crew are reduced to emotional polarisation over

studio in disgust.

Foster wipes his sweat with a dirty hanker chief. He pulls his

tie away from his tight collar, and pops the shirt button open.

He is desperate now, shivering with anger and frustration.

TV Man 2:    THERE IS A MARTIAL LAW STATE IN EFFECT IN

A murmur in the studio begins to build to an emotional

crescendo. Foster tries to talk over the noise...

TV Man 2:    CITIZENS WILL BE MOVED INTO CENTRAL AREAS OF

their places, but pandemonium reigns. A cameraman whips off his

headset and breaks for the door. His camera spins on its liquid

head, and on the monitors, we see a whirling blur as Foster

continues to speak.

Fran moves quickly for the spinning camera. She aims it back at

the sweating Foster, and she stares through the viewfinder not

believing what she is seeing.

quickly behind Fran.

Steve:	FRANNIE...AT NINE O'CLOCK MEET ME ON THE ROOF.

Fran:	(letting the camera slip slightly)

Steve:	WE'RE GETTING OUT. IN THE CHOPPER.

Another technician steps over to take the camera from Fran.

Stephen talks more quietly in the other man's presence.

Steve:	NINE P.M. ALRIGHT?

Fran:	STEVE...WE CAN'T...WE'VE GOT TO...

Steve:	WE'VE GOT TO NOTHING, FRAN. WE'VE GOT TO

Stephen is gone in a flash. Fran nervously looks back at the

cameraman. The argument still rages between Foster and Berman.

The cameraman, without taking his eye from the viewfinder,

speaks to Francine quietly and slowly.

Cameraman:   GO AHEAD. WE'LL BE OFF THE AIR BY MIDNIGHT

We see several large buildings. They are part of a low-income

housing project, and their lack of grace is evident. They stand

like tombstones as the first stars appear in the navy blue sky.

Unit go unnoticed. Grappling hooks grab against the lip around

the roof and silent figures climb to the top of the building.

Men in armour vests, clutching the latest in special weapons,

take position here and there about the development.

Other men strategically place their cars and trucks in the court

below.

behind a large truck, shouts through an electric bullhorn.

Commander:   MARTINEZ...YOU'VE BEEN WATCHING...YOU KNOW WE

The electronically amplified voice echoes through the concrete

caverns between the buildings of the project. There are only a

few windows which glow with lights from inside. At the sound of

the bullhorn, the lights all blink out one at a time.

Commander:   (not over the bullhorn)

Sergeant:    LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE GONNA TRY TO FIGHT US.

Commander:   (on the bullhorn again)

Roger:	YET.

Commander:   THREE MINUTES, MARTINEZ.

Roger:	AND COUNTING.

There is a long silence.

Roger:	COME ON, MARTINEZ!

One of the other S.W.A.T. team members is a big man, with a

rough and vicious looking face. He is WOOLEY, a hardened

veteran, and a red neck of the first order.

Wooley:	 YEAH, COME ON, MARTINEZ...SHOW YOUR GREASY

Roger looks over at the big man. He is distressed at the pent up

violence in Wooley.

Wooley:	 I'LL BLOW ALL THEIR ASSES OFF...LOW LIFE BASTARDS..

Roger is greatly concerned. He looks at one of the other men, a

young, smoothed faced rookie. The boy doesn't know now to react.

He is obviously nervous.

Roger:	KEEP COOL. JUST DON'T POP OFF IN THERE WHEN WE

The boy nods, grateful for a more human contact.

Wooley:	 HOW THE HELL COME WE STICK THESE LOW LIFES

Roger:	(to the boy)

The boy nods in the affirmative.

Wooley:	 LET'S GET ON WITH IT. THIS IS A WASTE OF

open and several figures rush out of the darkness. Shots are

fired from hand guns. A bullet smashes through the skull of the

young boy next to Roger. He falls against Roger with a pleading

expression on his face.

Figures charge this way and that. More gunfire. The other

S.W.A.T. men dodge and dive for cover. Wooley opens fire with

his automatic weapon.

man. He tries to free himself and his weapons. Shots ring out.

A handful of Black and Puerto Rican youngsters charge about the

rooftop. Another S.W.A.T. patrol appears from behind a large

elevator housing. The young civilians retreat. Several are mowed

down.

Another bullet smashes against the dead S.W.A.T. man's back.

Just as Roger frees himself, a bullet catches him squarely in

the chest, but his armour takes the impact. He is thrown back

off balance, and he struggles to catch his wind as he scrambles

over to recover his weapon which skitters away across the roof

top.

Before he reaches the gun, he is cut off by the looming figure

of one of the Black youths, pistol in hand. Roger freezes. The

young man aims his hand gun, but hesitates. A sudden barrage of

bullets rips through the young Black and he falls in a pool of

blood. It was Wooley's gun that killed him.

Wooley:	 COME ON YOU DUMB BASTARDS...

He fires again and again, even though the skirmish is winding

down.

Roger charges for his weapon, snatches it up, and runs for the

cover of an incinerator housing. He startles a young civilian

who was hiding there, trying to load his gun. The boy makes a

break...

Roger:	HOLD IT...

The boy freezes for a moment, then, thinking, breaks into a run

across the roof.

Roger:	HOLD IT, KID...DON'T RUN OUT THERE!

The boy is mowed down in a crossfire.

the National Guard are crashing through hallways and breaking

into apartment units. People are herded into the halls where

they are held at gun point.

Some men, although armed, surrender willingly. Others retaliate

against the invading force, and little skirmishes develop on

every floor of the complex structure.

Commander:   MASKS...

Sergeant:    (into walkie talkie)

S.W.A.T. 1:  WORK YOUR WAY DOWN. A FLOOR AT A TIME.

Roger and Wooley and the men in their unit, snap on their

bizarre looking gas masks.

kneels in prayer at a small alter, while their children and

their children's children huddle in a corner. The young husband

surrenders his gun to a trooper, and Roger watches as the group

is led into the hallway.

Suddenly, a young Black man charges out of one of the

apartments. A woman appears at the door, screaming for him to

stop. He breaks through a cloud of gas and Wooley fires his

automatic. The black man crashes to the floor. Wooley is crazed.

He kicks in the door of another apartment and fires randomly

into the room.

The flurry of action causes panic among the civilians in the

hall. The younger ones try to escape while the older people

kneel or fall against the walls praying.

S.W.A.T. 2:  WOOLEY'S GONE APE SHIT, MAN...

Roger:	WOOLEY! (shouting)

Wooley kicks in the door of another apartment. Roger charges at

him and grabs him around the shoulders. The big man resists. His

gun fires and bullets fly wildly. He struggles against Roger,

but Roger manages to hold on.

Roger:	GIMME A HAND...SOMEBODY...

Another S.W.A.T. Trooper steps up out of the cloud of gas. He is

very tall and he looks mysterious in the fog as he speaks in a

deep voice.

Trooper:	STEP AWAY FROM HIM.

Roger:	GIMME A HAND.

Wooley throws his body around and slams Roger against the wall,

but Roger grabs him again just as the crazed man is levelling

off his gun at the open apartment door.

Roger:	GODDAMMIT...HELP ME...HE'S CRAZY!

Trooper:	STEP AWAY FROM HIM!

Just then, Wooley wrenches free and pushes Roger across the

hallway. The Trooper carefully aims his weapon and fires one

shot through Wooley's head. The big man falls back violently.

The mysterious Trooper turns and hurries away down the hall.

Other S.W.A.T. Officers face him threateningly. He stares at

them through his mask. They let him pass. He disappears through

the smoke as other officers begin to restore order among the

civilians.

Women scream and cry over their dead-loved ones. Roger is helped

to his feet by another Officer. Roger's eyes are wide and

staring through the insect-like lenses of his mask. They are

locked on the sight he sees through the door of the apartment

which Wooley kicked open. The other Trooper looks and his eyes

widen as well.

remains of what was a human body. It has been ripped to shreds.

Roger staggers against the door frame. The other trooper moves

inside. Another corpse, also mutilated, one leg missing, one arm

badly mangled. It is trying to move. To reach the Troopers.

in the hall has seen the grisly sight, and she runs screaming

down the corridor. More confusion, as civilians push through the

Troopers who try to hold them back.

Trooper:	JESUS...HOLY JESUS...

A third officer enters the apartment. He speaks to the Trooper

which is closest to the writhing corpse on the floor.

Trooper 2:   SHOOT IT...SHOOT IT THROUGH THE HEAD.

The young officer is too dumb struck to respond so the third

Officer pulls out his pistol. Then suddenly, from out of the

shadows, a spectre-like figure lunges at the third Officer,

flailing and biting at his arms. It is a wild-haired woman.

There are several bleeding wounds over her body. She is one of

the walking dead.

The Trooper struggles to free himself, and Roger darts into the

room. Although the Zombie is weak, she manages to hold on to the

Trooper.

Another creature suddenly appears in the bedroom doorway. A

male, it staggers out into the room. The young Trooper struggles

with his holster trying to free his hand gun. Suddenly, he feels

something on his leg. The dismembered corpse is clutching his

ankle, pulling itself closer, it's mouth open. The boy tries to

pull away, but falls onto the floor, crashing over a table and

lamp. He tries to crawl away, but the frail corpse keeps its

hold and drags along behind the young Trooper, who still cannot

free his pistol.

Roger and the third Officer fling all their weight against the

woman Zombie. She flies against a wall, but bounces back

immediately, and attacks again. The third Trooper's rifle fires.

A slug tears through the woman's chest but it doesn't stop her

onslaught. Another shot rips through her neck. Still she comes.

The boy on the floor manages to level off his pistol. He fires

at the ghoulish head which draws closer to his leg. The thing's

skull blows open and its grasp relaxes. The boy is shaking

violently. His arm and gun stay in the air, still poised. He

fires again...and again...and again.

Troopers try to keep things calm.

S.W.A.T. 3:  IT'S ONE OF THEM...MY GOD...IT'S ONE OF THEM.

S.W.A.T. 4:  SHOOT FOR THE HEAD.

Woman:	NO! NO! MIGUEL...DIOS MIO...MIGUELITO...

The woman pushes through the crowd. The Zombies advances. Before

the Trooper can stop her, the woman throws her arms around the

creature.

Woman:	MIGUEL...MI VIDA...MIGUELITO...

S.W.A.T. 3:  GRAB HER...GET HER OUT OF THERE...

The Zombie clutches at the woman. It bites at her neck...her

arm. She screams with terror. She tries to pull away, but the

creature holds her. It bites again. A Trooper comes up from

behind and tries to wrestle the creature away. Another Trooper

grabs the woman and tries to free her. She is screaming

insanely. The Zombie pulls another piece of flesh off her arm.

S.W.A.T. 3:  STAND CLEAR...FOR CHRISSAKE...STAND CLEAR!

and the two tumble to the floor. Roger wrestles her free and,

with all his might, throws her against the wall. She advances

again. Roger raises his gun, She is just about to reach him. He

fires. The bullet drops her.

male ghoul's head. The creature loses his grip on the screaming

woman. The Trooper who is holding her, pulls her free across the

floor. S.W.A.T. 3 fires. The bullet tears through the Zombie's

shoulder...another shot...through his neck...another...through

the skull. It falls.

Troopers and befuddled old people seem to drift through the

clouds of gas in a totally dazed state.

stands against the open door jamb for a moment.

A sudden, loud gunshot makes Roger duck and spin around. He

looks into the apartment. The young Trooper has shot himself

through the head.

metal door from one of the halls and falls against the stair

railing. He is retching. He breathes heavily to contain himself.

He removes his mask and coughs slightly from the gas mist which

still clings in the air.

Voice:	YOU'RE NOT ALONE BROTHER.

Roger tightens, grabbing for his gun. The voice is present; very

nearby. Roger looks up. Sitting on the stairs above is the

Trooper who shot Wooley. His rifle is aimed at Roger.

Voice:	YOU WAS IN WOOLEY'S UNIT.

Roger:	I DIDN'T SEE NOTHIN.

Roger slings his rifle, so the Trooper relaxes and lowers his

gun. He removes his gas mask. He is Black.

Roger:	YOU RUNNIN?

The Black man shrugs. He hasn't decided.

Roger:	I DON'T JUST MEAN 'CAUSE OF WOOLEY.

Voice:	YEAH. I KNOW.

Roger:	THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE RUNNIN'.

Roger stares up at the grim faced Black.

Roger:	I COULD RUN RIGHT TONIGHT.

The black man just stares levelly into Roger's eyes.

Roger:	FRIEND OF MINE GOT A HELICOPTER. HE DOES

The Black man smiles.

Roger:	YOU THINK IT'S RIGHT TO RUN?

The Black man shrugs again, then he stands and walks down the

stairs. HE turns past Roger on the landing and continues down

into the lingering gas mist. Roger follows.

stairwell is dark. The noise grows louder. The Troopers ready

their weapons.

The sounds are little scraping thumps, like the weary foot falls

of someone...something...trying to negotiate the stairs...There

is the low, wheezing sound of laboured breath.

The men stare at the landing below. The Black man steps forward

slightly, trying not to make a sound.

Suddenly, a figure pops out of the darkness. It falls against

the wall below. Both Troopers raise their guns. The figure pulls

away from the wall. In the mist, it's shape is ghostly...

robed...in black...is sees the Troopers...

Figure:	 SENORES...

The voice weakens into a low wheezing cough. The figure slumps

and sits on the steps, clinging to the railing. It is an old

Priest, obviously from a local Puerto Rican Parish.

Roger stoops next to the old man, who is struggling to keep his

breath. He is weary. He seems to be near death. He clutches at

his chest.

Roger tries to support him.

Roger:	LET'S GET HIM TO THE MEDICS...

Priest:	 NO...NO...NO...PLEASE. JUST...LET

Roger:	THEY'RE TAKIN' EVERYONE DOWN...THEY PROBABLY

Priest:	 MY SISTER...SHE IS DEAD...THEY TELL ME...

Roger and the Black Trooper shoot glances at one another.

Priest:	 JUST LET ME PASS. MARTINEZ IS DEAD.

The Priest goes into a coughing fit. The Troopers look on. Roger

wants to help in some way.

Priest:	 MANY HAVE DIED ON THESE STREETS IN THE LAST

The Troopers are shocked. The Priest struggles to his feet.

Priest:	 I HAVE GIVEN THEM THE LAST RITES.

The old man starts up the stairs. Roger moves to help him, but

the big Black man stops him. The Priest weaves up through the

gas mist, coughing.

Priest:	 YOU ARE STRONGER THAN US...BUT SOON, I

The old man's voice trails off up the stairwell as he disappears

in the cloud...

Priest:	 WHEN THE DEAD WALK, SENORES...WE MUST

the boards which are nailed over the entrance to the storage

area.

The rest of the riot troops stand at the ready, weapons

raised...high powered rifles...flame throwers...

The nails creak loudly as they are pulled free. The men are

silent, not knowing what to expect.

There are three boards left...then two...

With a great, tearing sound, the door flies open before the men

remove the last boards. The boards fly and the door almost rips

off its hinges. Like flood waters, a small army of Zombies

pushes into the hall.

They are wide eyed and terrifying. In life, they were mostly

Blacks and Puerto Ricans from the neighbouring buildings. They

are all ages, from the very old to the very young.

The riot troops are stunned. They cannot react quickly enough,

and the squeeze is so tight in the little hall that it is

impossible to shoot accurately, or without the bullets injuring

other troopers.

The men fight back, wrestling and trying to back away. In the

front line, Zombies bite at the flesh of the humans. Teeth tear

into arms and hands. Some men are trampled in the crush.

Commander:   BACK OFF...BACK OFF...SPREAD OUT...

The rear lines retreat into the wider vestibule, and as the mass

of struggling bodies spreads out, shots begin to fire. Some

Troopers, at close quarters, are able to fire off accurate

rounds with their hand guns. Others fall and are lunged at by

clutching ghouls.

Roger and the Black Trooper are in the middle of the battle.

They fight off several of the creatures. The battle spreads into

little skirmishes through the dark hallways. The highly

organised Troopers are scattered and confused by the mindless

onslaught.

area, several Troopers move into the room.

The walls are dank and grey. There is a dripping sound. All

around lie remnants of human civilisation. Baby buggies and

bicycles chained to pipes which ring the area. Large trunks and

cartons of every size and shape; old beds and other furniture.

And here and there throughout the large area lie the remains of

corpses. They have been eaten away. Most of them are still

moving, their heads uninjured.

Two of the Troopers retreat, revulsed. The sound of the gunfire

and screaming can be heard from the hall.

The big Black man walks calmly into the room. Roger watches him.

He walks up to the writhing creatures one at a time, and fires

carefully aimed shots into their heads with his hand gun. Tears

roll down his cheeks.

Some of the creatures are without arms and legs. Some have been

eaten away about the neck and shoulder. They moan with a

gurgling, gutteral sound as they try to move.

A young Black Zombie, pulling itself along the floor with one

arm, draws close to the Black Trooper. The big man aims his

pistol. It clicks...empty. He quickly and efficiently reaches

for more ammunition and begins to reload. The Zombie pulls

closer, its mouth wide.

Roger steps up behind the other Trooper and fires into the

creatures head with his automatic rifle.

The Black man brushes tears from his eyes and continues to load

the pistol.

Roger disposes of several other creatures. he comes to a place

where several are piled together. Some lie still, others writhe

about. Two on the heap, although they cannot move about, are

eating at parts of other bodies. Roger shoots them. They never

look up. They don't seem to notice him at all.

A loud creaking sound breaks the mood suddenly. Roger looks up.

Several other Troopers look down into the storage area.

Trooper:	JESUS CHRIST.

He shines a light beam down towards Roger.

Trooper:	YOU OK DOWN THERE?

The trooper leaves the opening. He is replaced by two others who

just stare down into the storage room through the weird, round

lenses of their masks.

big Black man snaps his loaded clip into his pistol and takes a

few steps forwards. He sees a corpse wrapped in a bed sheet and

tied securely with clothes line. It looks like a mummy. It is

writhing, trying to free itself. he shoots it through the head.

Nearby, a small corpse, that of a very young child, is also

writhing, but the end of the shroud, where the child's feet

should be, has been torn open and is bloody. A stump kicks

around the blood where a foot has been eaten off. The Black man

fires into the thing's head.

Roger:	THEY...ATTACK...EACH OTHER...

Black:	JUST THE FRESH CORPSES...BEFORE THEY REVIVE...

Roger:	WHY DID THESE PEOPLE KEEP THEM HERE? WHY

Black:	'CAUSE THEY STILL BELIEVE THERE'S

The big man fires into the head of another squirming Zombie.

by ghouls. Other Troopers fire their automatics through the

heads of attacking Zombies. The riot troops try to stay

organised, but the onslaught is so mindless and random that it

is turning into a riot.

occasional wooden creak as the floating docks strain against one

another.

There are a few big Police launches still docked in the marina.

They bob about silently. The chain, which normally restricted

the area, is broken and dangling. The sign, which reads: CITY OF

PHILADELPHIA - POLICE - NO ADMITTANCE clangs against the broken

chain in the wind.

Halfway down the long dock is a little guard house. Inside,

sitting at a radio transmitter, is the corpse of a uniformed

guard.

Nearby is a separate floating dock on which is painted a large

square pattern. It is a landing bay for Police helicopters.

Alongside, afloat separately but securely chained fast, is a

small fuel barge, with pumps and hoses for refueling the chopper

and launches.

The other bodies lie bleeding on the bobbing docks, another

officer and a civilian. A bell buoy rings in the distance and we

begin to hear the sound of an approaching helicopter.

The blades of the J.A.S. Traffic Copter whine as they gear down

for a landing. The whirlybird settles like a hummingbird on the

Steve:	COME ON...I NEED YOU.

Francine unbuckles her safety belt and jumps out of her side of

the machine. Steve runs, ducking under the blades, around to the

woman's side of the cockpit, grabs her hand, and they make for

the fuel pumps.

Steve:	I DON'T SEE ROGER. WE'LL GIVE HIM TEN MINUTES.

Fran:	OH MY GOD!

lie near the fuel pumps.

Steve:	YOU HAVEN'T BEEN OUT IN IT AT ALL.

He pulls her quickly along. They have to actually step over the

civilian corpse. Fran freezes again. She can't bring herself to

walk over the body. Steve lets go of her hand and checking the

tank gauge, he pulls the hose with him as he moves quickly back

to Fran. The long hose is heavy, and it bobbles the civilian

corpse, almost rolling it over. The back of the bodies head has

been blown out by the exit wound of a powerful bullet. Blood

still runs. The wound is fresh. Steve does not see this as he

tugs the hose over the corpse and moves to the helicopter with

Fran following.

Steve jams the hose nozzle into the fuel tank receptacle. He

pulls one of Fran's hands into the nozzle mechanism.

Steve:	JUST LIKE THIS...LIKE A CAR...

Fran responds, getting the feel of the nozzle trigger.

Steve:	THAT'S IT...JUST HOLD HER THERE 'TIL SHE

The woman takes over and Stephen trots away toward the guard

shed. The propeller blades still spin. They make an eerie,

whispering sound as they pass over Fran's head. She can hear the

lapping water now, and the creaking moans of the shifting docks.

She looks this way and that, fear in her eyes.

operator. A signal is coming over the receiver in Morse Code.

The corpse is slumped over the desk and it is covering the send

key. A small entry wound is barely visible in the back of the

dead man's head. As Stephen pulls the body up to an erect

posture in its chair, he sees that the exit of the bullet all

but obliterated the corpse's face. Again the wound is still

running and bits of flesh and blood are splattered about the

desk and the radio unit.

Stephen clicks on the send switch and he quickly begins to send

a message in Morse:

finds a toolbox.

As he stands up, he backs into a tall figure which stands in the

shadows. Feeling something sharp and hard against his back.

Steve recoils and spins to face the figure. It is a uniformed

officer. His rifle is levelled off at Steve's chest. From out of

the shadows, a second Policeman appears with a hand gun cocked

and aimed.

suddenly she catches a movement in the corner of her vision.

Through the open sides of the helicopter bubble, she notices a

Police van. It has been there all along, it's doors flung wide

open, as though abandoned hurriedly. Now one of the rear doors

move. A figure appears carrying a large packing carton. The

figure is uniformed, with two rifles strapped to its back. It

rushes toward the launch docks.

Voice:	JUST STAY COOL.

Fran, already startled by the running figure, is now doubly

shocked by the calm voice behind her. She spins and the fuel

nozzle clatters out of it's receptacle to the wooden dock

boards. She is facing another "Policeman", to aims a rifle

directly at her head.

Officer 1:   IF YOU DIE...IT'LL BE YOUR OWN FAULT.

The Officer who is running with the carton shouts toward the

Guard House.

Officer 2:   COME ON SKIPPER...THEY GOT FRIENDS COMIN'.

while the other uniformed man moves to the door to check the

progress of the approaching vehicles.

Officer 3:   WHO ARE YOU?

Steve:	WE'RE WITH J.A.S...WE...

Officer 4:   (at the door)

Officer 3, the Skipper, pushes Steve with his gun barrel. Steve

spins out through the open doorway. He looks up the dock and

sees the vehicle which is just turning onto the pier which is

almost a mile long.

Roger is trying to play dumb, assuming that the other Policemen

He slings his rifle and tosses the other gun back to Fran. She

bobbles it and it falls, skittering across the dock.

Fran:	HOW MANY REAL ONES?

himself. Soon, he nods again...falling asleep. Peter kicks him

in the shoulder.

Steve looks back, surprised that the big man is awake. Peter

just stares at him.

Steve rubs his face violently with his free hand. He pulls at

his lower eyelids.

Steve:	ANY MORE WATER?

Peter reaches into the supplies and produces a plastic container

with water. Steve slugs some of it and pours a little onto his

face. Then he passes it back to Peter, who also drinks.

Suddenly, Fran stiffens and wakes up with a start. Peter looks

over at her with a gentle expression. She takes a moment to

orient herself.

Peter:	(to Stephen)

Steve:	I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE.

Peter:	HARRISBURG?

By now, Steve has drained the dregs from the first pump into the

He trots off after Fran.

machine at one end of the room.  The machine clicks loudly and

spits out a cup. To Peter's surprise, the cup starts to fill

with hot brown liquid.

While he waits. Peter notices a series of notes taped to the

machine and the surrounding walls. They are all written

hurriedly in various hands and with all sorts of inks and

colours.

There are dozens of such messages. Peter takes the full coffee

cup from the machine. As he sips it, his eyes fall on a closet

door just across the room. It is moving slightly. It is locked,

but it bangs against the lock...once...twice...more regularly

than if caused by the wind drafts.

Peter steps closer. Now the door bangs violently with a loud

crash, but it holds. Peter sets his coffee on the chart table

and takes his rifle in both hands.

Again the door bangs hard, and a skeleton key is knocked out of

the keyhole. It falls to the floor with a metallic clang, and

Peter notices a caked blood stain where blood recently ran out

of the closet, under the door and onto the linoleum.

Another bang and a gurgling moan. One of the living dead is

trying to break out of the closet.

Quite calmly. Peter raises his rifle and aims it at the door

about head high. The rifle roars in the little room, and a

splintery hole appears in the old wooden door.

hangars. Stephen is checking out the cockpit of an old Cessna

inside. Immediately, Stephen runs out and grabs Fran's hand. As

they turn the corner to run up the grade to the helicopter, they

are confronted with two Zombies, staggering slowly towards them

through the dust cloud from the chopper.

Fran screams. They have no weapons with them.

A third Zombie lumbers toward the helicopter. Roger's back is

still for a moment...then another moan and the door bangs again.

Peter fires two shots, lower right and lower left of the first

forming a triangle.

Steve:	JUST RUN.

Fran is petrified. She turns and looks behind them. They are

boxed in by the hangars.

Steve:	RUN RIGHT PAST 'EM...RIGHT AROUND 'EM.

She hesitates. The Zombies draw closer.

Steve:	RUN, FRANNIE. GODDAMMIT, I'M RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

Fran charges up the little grade. She runs to the right of the

creatures and they move in her direction, arms outstretched. As

she draws near to the dead things, she hesitates again in

fright. The creatures claw at the air. The one in front is

within a few feet of the woman.

Steve:	RUN, FRANNIE. MOVE!

Fran stares into the dead, staring eyes of the lead Zombie. She

is almost hypnotised. At the last instant, she runs and just

gets past the creatures. A little up the grade, she turns and

looks back, stopping again.

One Zombie turns slowly and starts up the grade after Fran. The

other continues to advance on Stephen.

thin beams of sunlight which cut through between the wooden

boards of the structure. Stephen roots around among the greasy

tools which clutter the area. He finds an enormous sledge

hammer. He runs out of the shed.

Steve sees that Fran is still facing the second creature. The

man takes a firm grip on the giant hammer as he charges up the

grade toward the Zombie's back. As he reaches the creature, he

brings the twenty pound steel head of the sledge slamming

against the ghoul's skull with all his might.

The creature staggers on for a few more steps, its head a bloody

pulp, then it falls to its knees and finally flops face down in

the dust.

Without breaking stride, Stephen grabs Fran's hand and the two

run toward the helicopter. The other Zombie at the hangar has

turned around and is walking up the grade.

Roger from behind.  Steve shouts and Roger spins around. The

stumbling creature is very close. It raises its arms and its

hands clutch at the air. Roger lets the fuel nozzle drop to the

ground. He is trapped at the side of the machine. He doesn't

have his rifle. He fumbles with the snap on his hand-gun

holster.

Suddenly, the blank face of the Zombie turns red as the top of

its head seems to disintegrate into a bloody pulp. The creature

has walked into the spinning chopper blade. Its body staggers

forward another step or two, then the thing collapses in a heap.

Roger calmly aims and fires one shot cleanly through the

should be. There seems to be no way that the volley could have

missed.

Silence for a moment. Peter still holds his gun high.

Then, with a great crash, the closet door flies open into the

room. Two small children burst out. One has no left arm; the

other has been bleeding from a great wound in his side. They are

dead. They move directly toward Peter. Their heads are at least

a foot shorter than the bullet holes in the closet door.

Peter stares down at the creatures, revulsed.  He is so startled

that he cannot react quickly enough, and they are on him. The

moment he feels their clammy grasp, he regains his survival

instincts. He cannot effectively aim his rifle. He kicks and

thrashes around. One creature flies against a wall. The other is

about to bite the man's arm. The big Black grabs the small

Zombie and flings it physically back. The other creature pounces

on his back. He throws it over his shoulders and it crashes

against its brother.

Now Peter raises his gun. As the children try to scramble to

their feet the man fires several shots in rapid succession.

First one creature falls; then the other.

Peter continues to fire, his eyes wide with desperation and

disgust. Finally his weapon clicks. It is out of ammunition.

Peter breathes heavily. He stares at the small corpses.

Instinctively, he begins loading his weapon, without even

looking at the action, as he backs wearily out toward the door

of the chart house.

Peter turns and startles. He reaches for more shells and backs

away a few steps as he tries to load the bullets into his gun.

The creature reaches out and takes another step into the room.

Peter stares into the creatures eyes. Then suddenly, out in the

sunlight, a few hundred feet behind the Zombie, Stephen appears

with his rifle. Peter sees the man over the creature's shoulder.

of Stephen's bullets tears through the Zombie's shoulder, but

Immediately, he sees the anger in Peter's eyes. The big Trooper

then raises his rifle and aims it a Stephen. Steve tries to

stand, but trips and falls on his back in the dust. In an

instant, Peter is looming over him with the barrel of his rifle

aimed at point blank range for the shivering man's forehead.

Fran screams through her choking...

Fran:	NO...MY GOD...DON'T... WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

Peter speaks calmly to Stephen, in low tones.

Peter:	YOU NEVER AIM A GUN AT ANYONE, MISTER.

Stephen looks up at the tall man, shivering. Then Peter lowers

his weapon and extends his hand, helping Stephen up onto his

feet.

Roger helps Fran climb aboard. Steve wanders around the front of

the cockpit bubble and climbs into the Pilot's seat. Roger

Roger:	WE'RE GETTIN' OUTA HERE FINE.

Roger trots up and peers through another of the bubbles.

Peter:	MOST OF THE GATES ARE DOWN. I DON'T THINK			THEY CAN GET INTO THE STORES.164	The vantage point only reveals a small aspect of the interior,

a square plaza with a garden beneath the sunroof of transparent

bubbles. The space is open all the way down to the garden, which

is two storeys below. Around the garden on the bottom floor can

be seen the entrances to several shops. All but one have heavy

metal cage gates down and locked into position.

One or two Zombies are seen wandering about. They cannot enter

the stores, except for the one which is un-gated.

Halfway up the walls can be seen a balcony railing which rings

the entire plaza, it is a second storey of shops. The same cage-

gates seal off the visible store entrances, but none of the dead

creatures are evident on the balcony.

Peter:	GUESS THE POWER'S NOT OFF IN THIS AREA.

Roger is peering down through a wire-hatched skylight. There are

several laid out over this particular area of the roof. He moves

to another while Peter looks down into the first. Fran and

Stephen jog up.

Roger:	THESE DON'T GO DOWN INTO THE MALL.

Roger:	STORAGE?

of a triangle within a circle, and the letters C.D.

Roger:	AND BOXES OF CANNED FOOD!

Steve:	HOW DO WE GET DOWN THERE?

Peter looks at Stephen as a street-wise-tough would look at a

hopeless city-slick-sissy. Then the big man brings his rifle

gives Roger a familiar nod. Roger stands several feet back, his

ducks away flat against the wall. Roger stiffens, his finger all

The Troopers cautiously move into the area through the door. The

Roger:	DOUBLE DAMN! LOOKS LIKE A FREE LUNCH, BUDDY.183	In the first room Stephen has started to rip open one of the

cartons.

Fran:	SPAM!

Roger walks back into the room.

Fran:	OH.

Roger:	THEN DON'T KNOCK SPAM. IT'S GOT IT'S OWN KEY.

Roger swills water from an empty Spam can which he has filled

from one of the C.D. drums.

Peter:	THERE'S AN AWFUL LOT OF STUFF DOWN THERE THAT

woman.	Peter:	YOU'LL PROB'LY HEAR SOME SHOOTING.			JUST DON'T PANIC, OK.

Fran sighs exhaustedly.

Peter:	YOU'LL BE ALRIGHT. IT'S OUR ASSES THAT'S IN

his flashlight and shines the beam around. He is in a very small

concrete space. The stairs go down no further. There is only one

door. Peter eases down the steps behind.	Roger:	THIS IS THE ONLY WAY UP THERE.192	We see the other side of the metal door. It stands in another

cement walled space, which also seems small from our angle, but

it is fully lit.	The door opens slowly, and the Troopers cautiously step out. As

the camera swings around, we see that the men are at the end of

a long narrow hallway. Directly across from them are two open

supply rooms, one containing a stationery sink and a toilet.

Both rooms are filled with cleaning supplies.193	Down along the hall can be seen a dozen or so doorways. Some

doors are open, some are closed. Along the opposite wall there

is nothing.	The far end of the hall, about a hundred yards away, opens out

onto the second story of the mall proper.194	The men look at one another and slowly move down the corridor.

They try the first two doors, which are locked. The third is

wide open.

a large administrative office, with rows of desks which are

fully equipped for a staff of secretaries and accountants.196	The next room has a closed door, but it is unlocked. Peter	swings the door open and silently jumps into the room. This is

a much more spartan area, with two metal desks and a few chairs.

There are several phones. It is a maintenance office. On one

wall is a large map of the mall, with pin flags and scribbling

over an acetate which covers the drawing. At the other end of

the space is a huge electrical panel with circuit breakers and

an entire series of master controls all keyed by a number code

to another map of the mall showing electrical installations.	On the wall behind Peter is a large blackboard and two metal

cabinets. One is open. It contains all sorts of tools, manual

and electric. There are circuit testers, walkie talkie units and

there are several enormous rings containing hundreds of keys,

also colour and number coded. Peter grabs up one of the rings

and Roger steps up behind him.	Roger:	THE KEYS TO THE KINGDOM.197	Back in the hallway, Roger's hand tries another doorknob and	throws the door open. This opens onto beautifully plush offices,

obviously the executive headquarters.	The rooms interconnect, and while Peter walks from door to door

in the corridor, Roger moves through the inner doors, meeting

Peter at each room. One office is more elegant than the next,

with the latest in designer furniture and expensive decorations.198	The Troopers finally reach a room on which both the interior and

corridor doors are closed and locked. The brass nameplate on the

interior door reads C.J. Porter - President.199	Roger moves out to the corridor where he joins Peter. They move

into the exterior corridor. They are very near the end of the

hall, and the brightly lit shopping area is close at hand. They

can only see a small section.200	The balcony on their side is railed off against the open drop

down to the first floor, and across the great cavity they see

the opposite balcony. On the far side only two store fronts can

be seen. They are both gated and shut.

They look at each other and move forward, each clinging to

opposite walls in the corridor.202	As they reach the mall proper they slowly and carefully peer

around their respective corners.

building, and at several points bridges across from one side to

the other. Little shops of all types run along the entire length

of the balcony, and at each far end, stands the entrance arches

for a large department store.	Most of the stores are gated, but several seem open. The big

department stores are gated and locked. Here and there tall

trees grow up from the ground floor and reach up into view of

the second storey. There are none of the living dead evident on

the balcony.204	The two troopers move slowly and quietly to the railing. The

crouch and peer down through the bars of the rail. Below, the

sight is even more spectacular.205	Stores of every type offer gaudy displays of consumer items.	Everything from clothing to appliances. Photo equipment; audio

and video outlets; sporting goods and weaponry; gourmet foods

and natural organic foods. There is a Book Store, a Record

Store, a Real Estate Agency and a Bank; A Novelty Shop, a Gift

Shop; all with the absolute latest in American consumer items.

And at either end of the concourse like the main Altars at each

end of a Cathedral, stand the mammoth two storey Department

Stores; great symbols of a consumer society.

Down the centre of the ground floor, along with the gardens and

park benches, are little stalls. One is a Tobacco Specialist

another Jewellery; another is a small Photo Portrait stall where

mothers had their children photographed. There are restaurants

and Snack Bars and numerous coin operated machines selling

everything from children's toys to Blood Pressure readings.

There is a large turntable, designed to spin but which is now

still, holding a late model car on exhibit. Another turntable

displays futuristic household appliances.	The images are all too familiar, but in their present state they

appear as an archaeological discovery revealing the Gods and

Customs of a civilisation now gone.

The ghosts of a civilisation, however, are not figments in the

mind. They are quite real. And they walk below in the aisles of

the great Cathedral. At least twenty Zombies can be seen from

the Troopers' perspective.

Peter:	FAT CITY, BROTHER. HOW WE GONNA WORK IT.	Roger:	WE GET INTO THE DEPARTMENT STORES UP HERE.			THEY PROB'LY HAVE THEIR OWN ESCALATORS INSIDE.

Peter:	LET'S CHECK THOSE KEYS.

hall toward the Maintenance Office.

against the coded map on the wall.

Roger:	SEVENTY TWO...U. AND D. ...HERE IT IS...

The men check the keys. Peter finds corresponding numbers.

Peter:	HERE.

Roger:	LET'S JUST HOPE IT'S RIGHT.	Peter:	LOOK HERE (on the map) THESE NUMBERS MUST ALL

The man points to several numbered spots which seem to be within

the big Department Store they are studying.	Roger:	WASHROOMS...EQUIPMENT...I DUNNO.	Roger moves off toward the electrical control panel. Peter still

stares at the map.	Peter:	I GUESS THESE GOTTA BE THE GATES.

Roger:	HOW ABOUT A LITTLE MUSIC?

Peter:	WHAT?210	The big Black moves up behind his partner. One of the controls

on the panel is marked: MUSIC TAPE. It indicates a master switch

which is in the off position. Another is marked FLOOR EXHIBITS

and a series of others are marked ESCALATORS. There are dozens

of master switches which are in the off mode.

Peter:	POWER SWITCHES.

Roger:	THE MUSIC MIGHT COVER THE NOISE WE MAKE.	Peter:	HIT 'EM ALL. MIGHT AS WELL HAVE POWER IN			EVERYTHING. WE MIGHT NEED IT.

Roger hits the switches one at a time.

the rifle into her hands, ready to fire. She has been standing

just inside the storage area. She steps into the firestair and

looks down into the darkness. The sounds of the insipid music

drift up to her. She leans into the storage area again.

Fran:	STEPHEN...

The automobile turntable starts spinning; the great escalators

move up and sown. Two of the living dead, caught just starting

up two stalled escalator, fall and roll down as the mechanical

steps begin moving.

Lights blink on the exhibits, and mechanical window displays

begin their robot-like motions. It is like a Carnival coming

alive. The Zombies which wander the floor look about in

confusion. Some of them swat ineffectively at the moving

exhibits.215	In a very tall cage, which reaches from the first floor all the

way to the ceiling, the Tropical Birds which are housed within

begin to flutter and squawk.216	In a pet shop, there are puppies and kittens in a window

display. They whine and scramble over one another in fright at

the noise and the motion and the coloured lights.217	On one of the floor exhibits, a rear-projection movie starts. It

is a dryly produced film about the merits of a Real Estate

confronted by the Zombies from the balcony. He startles and

ducks back into the room. The closest Zombie is reaching out

with clutching hands. Peter raises his gun and fires two shots

cleanly through the creature's head.220	As the shots ring through the area, Fran, standing at the top of

the firestair, startles. Steve grabs the rifle from the woman.

Steve:	JESUS CHRIST...

his weapon. The creature falls in a heap.	Roger:	WHATD'YA THINK? BAG IT OR TRY FOR IT?

Peter:	YOU GAME?	Roger nods and the two men run down the hall toward the mall.	Their rifles poised, they are like commandos on an important

mission.

The men at the mall mouth see the department store and start for

it. They run from the corridor onto the balcony.222	The battle to win the mall has begun. The creatures which wander

the first floor look about, attracted by the sound, but they are

confused. They walk this way and that, in mis-guided staggering

strides.223	Several of the Zombies try to move up the down-escalator. They

fall over themselves and cannot negotiate the moving stairway.224	A few creatures who move onto the up-escalator also fall against

each other from the movement, but one falls onto the moving

steps and is carried upward. Then another manages to keep its

balance holding on to the hand rail.

are being carried up to the balcony. The one supporting himself

on the hand rail is still standing. The head of the standing

Zombie suddenly becomes visible from Roger's perspective.

Peter tries to life the roll gate. It won't move. It is still

locked.	Peter:	YOU BASTARD!

Roger:	WHAT?

Peter:	STILL LOCKED...(he sees another assembly)

The big man moves to the far side of the gate. The same key

fits. Roger re-focuses on the creature which is riding the

escalator. It is quite near the top now. Roger is about to

shoot when something catches his eye.

escalator, but before it reaches the bottom, it stops rolling.

The steps carry it back up toward the second floor again. It is

still very much alive. The two creatures on the balcony struggle

to stand.235	Roger looks back over his shoulder.236	The Zombies from the side concourse are now about a hundred and

fifty feet away.

the far right are free, but there is a third lock on the far

left. Peter moves to it quickly.238	On the first floor concourse, other creatures are beginning to	take note of the action upstairs. They start to move.239	The Zombies on the stationary stairway are beginning to reach

the second floor, but they are far down the main balcony. They

will have to pass the administrative corridor in order to reach

the Department Store.

Fran:	STEPHEN...FOR GOD'S SAKE...LET'S GET UP ON THE

below. More gunfire can be heard from the mall.

Steve:	IT'S ALRIGHT, I'M TELLIN 'YA. THOSE THINGS			DON'T MOVE FAST ENOUGH TO CATCH US.	More gunfire can be heard.244	Now the giant gate rolls up with a loud rumble. Peter ducks into

the store even as the gate is still rising, but the inertia of

the great metal cage carries the lip up out of Peter's grasp. He

jumps to try to catch it, but he misses. It jerks up into its

fully open position and rolls back down slightly, but still

Peter cannot reach the lip. It slides back to rest about three

feet above Peter's fingertips.245	The Zombies advance.246	Roger drops another with a clean shot through the head, then he

backs into the archway of the Department Store entrance. Peter

is desperately looking around for something to stand on to reach

the gate.247	The Zombies are very close to the arch now, advancing steadily.

heavy for him to move himself.

Peter:	HERE...COME ON...

Roger has to abandon his post at the arch long enough to help

drag the little counter. The men drag it to a point just at the

side of the open arch, and Peter instantly jumps up on the top

of it. At that instant, a Zombie rounds the corner and grabs at

Peter's legs. The big man kicks, startled, and the motion causes

him to fall off the little counter. He lands on his feet, but

out on the balcony beyond the arch. Roger brings his rifle butt

around against the creature's head and the Zombie falls back,

but is not dead.

Other creatures are only a few feet from Peter, whose gun sits

on the little counter inside the store. Roger levels off his

rifle but cannot fire as Peter is in the line. Peter makes a

move and, like a football player, jukes to the left, then to the

right. He dives right at one of the creatures carrying it into

the store.	Now Roger fires, dropping one, then another. Peter jumps back up	on the counter.	Peter:	BEHIND YOU...BEHIND YOU...

The creature in the store has crashed against a cosmetics

display and is regaining its footing. Roger turns and fires. The	creature falls. Peter grabs the lip of the roll gate and starts

to bring it down.

There are several creatures right in the archway, now they

clutch with their hands. One blocks the downward progress of the	gate. Roger fires point blank and the Zombie flies back. The

gate lowers but is stopped by the clutching hands of other

creatures. Roger grabs the cage now and helps to pull it down.

Peter, still gripping the lip, jumps off the counter to get more

leverage.	The bottom of the gate is now four feet from the floor. The two

men are able to move it steadily downward. The Zombies are very

weak, but more creatures appear making it more difficult. Then

one Zombie tries to crawl under the gate. Its torso just gets

through as the gate slams down against its chest. Its arms grab

for Peter's legs and its mouth is gasping. Its body is

preventing the gate from engaging in the floor mechanisms.	Roger lets go the cage as Peter tries to hold it against the

creatures outside. Grabbing his rifle, Roger brings the butt

straight down on the clutching Zombie's skull. The Zombie goes

limp. Then Roger tries to push the creature clear of the gate,

but the pressure is too great.

Roger:	LET UP A LITTLE...LET UP A LITTLE...

The gate rises a few inches. More Zombies appear outside. Their

hands clutch at the roll gate. The openings in the grid are only

big enough for their fingers, their hands can't reach through,

but they are pushing the gate higher and higher...more than

Peter intended to clear the obstructing corpse.	With his rifle butt, Roger manages to push the dead Zombie clear

except for one of its arms. From outside, a creature's hand

suddenly grabs Roger's weapon. For a moment its like a Tug-O-War.

Peter is having a harder time holding the gate. It is inching

upward.	Peter:	COME ON...COME ON...	Roger lets go his gun barrel and the weapon is snatched away by

the creature in the crowd. Roger grabs for the gate.	Peter:	THE ARM...THAT ARM'S IN THE WAY.	Roger squats again and manages to throw the dead Zombie's arm	clear. Then he grabs the gate again. Now it starts to move down

more steadily.	At the last moment, another clutching arm juts into the store,

but when the gate hits it, it withdraws, and the big cage clicks

solidly into place.

The two Troopers step back from the gate. The creatures still

moan and gurgle, slamming against the gate, their fingers

clutching at the grid, but they are unable to budge it.

There are ten or twelve Zombies trying to get into the

Department Store and several others are making their way along

the balcony. At least six lie dead along the floor.	Roger:	WELL...WE'RE IN...NOW, HOW THE HELL WE GONNA			GET BACK?	Peter:	LET'S GO SHOPPIN' FIRST.

The two men back into the aisles of the store. The creatures

outside still push and claw at the gate. The one with Roger's

rifle uses it as a bludgeon, but it has no effect.

it blinks out with a click as the door closes.	Fran:	STEPHEN...JESUS GOD...

She is very frightened.  She backs into the storage area.253	She moves quickly to the pyramid of cartons which lead to the	roof. She sits on the bottom carton biting her fingers.254	In the Department Store, Roger is riding down an escalator. He

has found a back pack, and it is obviously already filled with

goods. As he steps off the moving stairs on the ground floor,

the surroundings are eerily quiet.255	He moves through a clothing department. We see the dead looking

faces of store mannequins. Roger runs into one and is greatly

startled. He snatches up a lined windbreaker and ties it around

his waist by its arms, then he trots off down another aisle,

where he finds Peter.

Roger:	HEY MAN, WE CAN'T CARRY ALL THIS SHIT...

which we cannot yet see. As Roger trots up, he sees that Peter

has a big gardening cart already heaped with goods.

Roger:	OH...WE'RE GONNA JUST WHEEL RIGHT BY 'EM, RIGHT?	Peter:	WE GONNA TRY, BROTHER. WE AIN'T DOIN' THIS

Roger:	THERE'S NO WAY THIS IS GONNA HAPPEN...

Even though he doesn't understand the plan, Roger helps Peter

things up like contestants on a game-show who have five minutes

in a store to grab whatever they can.259	Stephen is in the Maintenance office. He examines the maps and	electrical equipment, then rummages through a desk.260	At the open end of the corridor leading to the second storey

many others. It is a complete maintenance manual revealing all

the workings and layout of the huge structure.264	Elevator doors slide open with a loud whoosh. The two Troopers

appear in the car, wheeling their barrow out onto the second

storey aisles of the big store.265	Now, they can see the roll gate and the creatures pushing at it

ineffectively. They roll their barrow very close to the gate.

When the Zombies catch sight of the humans, their efforts are

renewed. They moan and push harder at the gate.266	They Troopers leave the barrow, disappearing back to the aisles.	They run onto the interior escalator, bounding down faster than

the moving steps, then they run across the first floor until

they see the lower level-roll gate.267	There are creatures wandering the concourse, but none of them	are at the gate.	Peter:	LET'S GO BROTHER...THE OLD OKEY DOKE!

The men move up to the roll gate. A Zombie lumbers past. Roger

speaks to the creature.

Roger:	HEY, UGLY!

The creature turns instantly. Registers. Then dives for the

gate with a moaning roar. Its mouth opens and its hands clutch.

The gate pops forward from the creature's thrust, but it holds

tightly. The action causes Roger to jump even though there is no

immediate danger.	Peter:	LET'S RAISE SOME HELL...HEY...HEY...

cabinets containing the walkie talkies and the keys.272	In the corridor, the stray Zombies move in and out of the

executive offices as they draw nearer to the Maintenance room.273	Several creatures fall over one another as they try to move down

the up escalator. The down escalator push others onto the first

floor. They scramble to their feet and move toward the

Department Store.

Already there are a dozen or so clutching and pushing at the

metal grid. Through the crowd. Peter can see several other

creatures lumbering down the stationary steps.

The big man readies his walkie talkie, pulling the antenna out.	Peter:	GO ON UP...STAY OUTTA SIGHT BUT LEMME KNOW			WHEN ITS CLEAR ENOUGH.	Roger, clutching his walkie talkie, disappears among the aisles

into the Maintenance Office.

The third staggers into the room. Stephen stands fast now. He

holds his rifle out in front of him. The creature walks toward

the gun. Steve holds his hands on the trigger. The Zombie lunges

suddenly, and grabs the gun barrel. Steve fires, but the blast

tears through the creature's chest. Steve struggles to raise the

barrel but the motion of the Zombie makes it impossible to aim

accurately. The gun fires again, this time grazing the Zombie's

neck. With a sudden burst of energy the creature wrenches the

gun free. Steve backs against the wall. The creature tosses the

rifle across the room where it slams the floor near a desk. The

Zombie advances on Steve. Steve is next to the key cabinet and

grabs at it, trying to find some weapon. He feels the tools in

the cabinet and comes up with a hammer. The Zombie is about to

reach him when Steve pulls the hammer out and upsets the

cabinet. The Zombie fumbles with the cabinet at its feet, but

doesn't fall. Steve tries to hit the creature's head with the

tool, he misses and the Zombie grabs at his arm, trying to bite

it. Steve wrenches free and the two bodies fall to the floor.

The creature clutches at the man's legs, it's teeth bared like

an animal. Steve kicks desperately and manages to land a blow

squarely in the creatures face. The Zombie comes after him again

and from his crawling position, Steve brings the hammer as an

uppercut to the creature's jaw. The creature falls back enough

for Steve to crawl across the floor. It follows, but Steve

reaches the desk and grabs his rifle. Rolling on the floor, he

fires several shots into the creature, finally destroying it.

wall at the mouth of the corridor. Before the Zombie can get its

balance, the big Trooper reaches down and grabs the creature's

jacket lapels. With all his might he flings the creature out

against the balcony railing. The creature flips over the rail,

The three move off down the aisles, then duck out of sight

around a corner. The Zombies clutch at the metal gate, moaning

and rattling the grid loudly.332	In the Maintenance hallway, we see the thick manual lying on the	floor. A lumbering foot kicks it as the Zombie in the corridor

wanders into another office. The creature ignores the book, as

it does the corpses strewn in the hall.333	In the fire stair, Fran is on the middle landing. She is

suddenly overcome with a wave of nausea. She clutches at her	stomach, retching. She sits on the landing, letting her head

along the balcony outside.

The men move stealthily along the aisles. They look up at the

ceiling and see a series of large grillwork panels. Peter shines

his flashlight beam into one.

Roger:	DAMN. THAT'S THOSE OTHER LOCK NUMBERS WE

Steve:	WHY THE HELL WOULD THEY BE LOCKED?

Peter:	JACKPOT, FLYBOY. YOU'RE RIGHT.

Roger:	WHAT?	Peter:	THEY'RE LOCKED BECAUSE YOU CAN GET THROUGH			'EM EASY FROM OTHER PARTS OF THE BUILDING.	Steve:	OVER HERE.339	Steve notices that one of the ceiling grids is very close to the

elevators. Peter looks at the grids, then down at the double

doors.	Peter:	THE ELEVATOR SHAFT!

He moves over and hits the button. The doors open.

Peter:	HOLD 'EM.	Roger stands against the rubber safety bumper, holding the car

doors open wide. Peter steps onto the hand railing and reaches

up for the escape hatch, which is held in place by four knub-

headed bolts. He removes the bolts quickly and dislodges the

hatch cover and passes it down to Stephen.	Then the big man sticks his head up through the opening.340	He looks around the elevator shaft, shining his flash this way	and that. He sees another grid in the shaft wall.

Peter:	IT'S HERE...AND IT AIN'T LOCKED. GET A SCREW-

Roger ducks off down an aisle and Steve moves to the nearby

furniture department and grabs a lightweight lamp table. The

elevator doors close. When Steve returns with the table he has

to hit the button again. The doors open. Peter is already

climbing out of the car into the shaft. Steve uses the table to

hold the doors open and goes to get another.

This time he gets a larger coffee table and sets it under the

opening in the car and puts the smaller table on top. He climbs

up and sticks his head out into the shaft. The doors close

again.342	In the greasy black shaft, amid the cables and elevator	mechanisms. Peter examines the wall grid with his flashlight.	Peter:	IT'S ALRIGHT...WE CAN GET IT OFF.

bag.	Roger:	ONE-STOP SHOPPING ...ANYTHING YOU NEED RIGHT			AT YOUR FINGERTIPS.344	Steve relays the tools up to Peter, who immediately begins to

work on the screws which mount the grid. He passes the

flashlight to Steve who holds the beam on the work area.345	Fran sits in the stairwell, her hand over her mouth. It is very

quiet for a moment, then she hears a slight clicking. Her head

snaps to attention. She stares down at the bottom landing. There

is a thump at the door.	Slowly the woman stands to her feet, her eyes transfixed on the

door below.	Fran:	STEPHEN!

The door starts to open. Light creeps in. The slow, lumbering

figure of the Zombie moves into the firestair. Choking back a

scream, Fran turns and runs up the stairs. The creature below

follows, unsure of itself in the dim light.

gathers her wits and moves to drag the food cartons over as a

barricade. She struggles with one of the cartons. It is very

glimpses Roger's knap-sack in the shadows. She runs for it as

immediate route. It is very near. Fran backs away a few steps as

she tries to strike the flare head on the small striker on the

cylinder cap. It doesn't fire...she tries again...and again.

Now, the Zombie has reached the knap-sack. It kicks through the

items and knocks and rolls the other flares.

Fran's flare finally catches with a great whoosh, the bright

flame startling the woman as well as the Zombie. The creature's

eyes go wide and it brings its arms up to avoid the brightness.

The intense white flame casts an eerie light over the creature

and throws the Zombie's enormous shadow against the cartons and

wall. The creature backs away a few steps almost tripping over

the articles on the floor.

Fran manages to advance close enough to snatch two extra

cylinders and skirt around the Zombie in a wide arc. The

creature swats the air, keeping distance, but threatening.

Fran considers the firestair door, but decides on the pyramid.

She circles around to a point where she can climb up from

behind the moaning Zombie. She rushes for the cartons and

climbs, but loses her footing while trying to hold the flares

and crashes into the topmost carton. It starts to slide off

the pyramid and tumbles to the floor almost crashing into the

Zombie. The creature starts to clutch at the pyramid.

The stack of cartons is now too short and Fran can reach the

skylight but can't pull herself up. She accidentally drops

two flares, including the lit one. It tumbles to the floor

behind the pyramid where it no longer offends the Zombie's

eye's. Now the creature tries to climb to the woman.

Fran grabs the last flare in her mouth and reaches with both

hands for the skylight. She lifts with all her might and her

feet come off the cartons but she cannot pull herself up. As she

tries to lower her feet back to the cartons, the pyramid shakes

and wobbles from the Zombie. The creature is making progress;

its hands can almost touch Fran's foot.

legs appear through the grid and he too swings down, holding on

with his hands to soften his landing.

Suddenly, we are aware of a third person on the room in the

large chair at the desk. Roger startles and grabs his gun.

Peter just stares. They are in the President's office. Some

days earlier, the President, shot himself in the head.

Peter:	COME ON...

Steve struggles overhead.

Peter:	JUST DROP, I GOT YOU...

Steve:	I CAN'T...I...

Peter:	(to Roger)

The two Troopers grab the desk and slide it away from the

President's corpse. The action causes the chair to spin slightly

and his wide terrified eyes seem to watch the action.

The desk in place. Steve's toes can reach its surface. He loses

his balance slightly and pulls back up. He kicks a picture frame

off the desk onto the floor, shattering the glass over photos of

the President's wife and children.

Peter:	COME ON!

Steve finally gets footing on the desktop and lowers himself

down. He stares at the corpse as Roger helps him off the desk.

backs slowly up the hall. The wheels squeak and the big man

bites his lip. Roger kicks the last corpse to the wall. Steve

notices that the fire stairs door is open wide.

Steve:	JESUS CHRIST!

He bounds towards the door. Roger spins to see what happened.

Peter turns and quickens his pace. Steve trots up the steps.

Roger:	(to Peter)

Peter runs with the cart the last few yards. As he gets to the

doorway, Roger breaks up the steps.

Steve:	FRANNIE!

though they will topple. She steadies herself with both hands.

The creature is grabbing at her legs. She kicks.

Roger:	DON'T SHOOT...THEY'LL HEAR YA...

Roger arrives and the two men charge the pyramid.

Roger pulls the back of the Zombie's clothing. The Zombie falls

and hits the floor. As it kneels up, Steve swings the butt of

his rifle and smashes it into the thing's head. Then Roger

delivers a blow with his gun, straight down.

hurriedly carry the corpse into the hall and roll it onto the

floor and retreat back into the fire stairs. Peter holds open

the door slightly and watches the corridor for a moment.

Convinced they've not been seen, he closes the door.

They grab more supplies from the barrow and start upstairs.

Steve:	WE'RE OK...WE'RE ALL OK...WE GOT A LOT

In the background the two Troopers bring their load of supplies

into the big room and deposit them near the TV. Then they go

downstairs for another load.

Steve:	THIS IS A TERRIFIC PLACE...FRANNIE. THIS PLACE

The woman still cannot stop sobbing and retching.

the door again. It is quiet except for the little noises of

eating and occasional rustle of paper. We also head a faint

electronic whistle, but we do not recognise it.

As we see more of the room, we find our refugees sitting near

the reconstructed pyramid on the floor. Peter seems to be asleep

up against the pyramid. Roger is nibbling at delicacies from the

Department Store's Gourmet department.

Their "loot" is laid around them on the floor. Roger, as he

eats, is leafing through the maintenance manual. There is a

stack of tools, some still in wrapping; electric razors, still

boxed; some clothing articles; the radio, which also plays small

cassettes. There are soaps, toiletries, pens, pencils, and

notebooks, flashlights, cigarettes and several decks of cards

with a canister of chips. The items are clearly not all

functional. Some are representative of the luxuries considered

necessary by a consumer society.

They are all bathed in the blue glow from the television which

Stephen tries to tune in. Its power cable is spliced into the

leads of a bare light fixture overhead. Fran cannot be seen at

first.

Roger:	WHAT THE HELL TIME IS IT, ANYWAY?

Steve:	ONLY ABOUT NINE.

Roger:	AND NOTHING? (referring to the TV)

On the screen we see the Civil Defence logo, and realise that

the high pitched electronic signal is coming from the TV set.

Steve:	AS LONG AS WE'RE GETTING THE PATTERN,

Roger snaps on the large, battery powered radio. He rolls the

dial getting nothing but static. Finally, he hears a signal

and tunes it in. A badly modulated voice is droning through

the interference. It sounds like a war correspondent sending

a signal from very far away.

Radio:	...REPORTS THAT COMMUNICATIONS WITH DETROIT

Roger:	PHILLY...

Steve:	I KNOW J.A.S IS OUT BY NOW...IT WAS A MADHOUSE

at Stephen, who is getting emotionally excited about their

exploits as a team.

audible. A tear rolls down the woman's cheek. The radio drones.

After a time, Steve appears. He is surprised to find the woman

awake. She sits on a new blanket from the store. Another is

rolled up as a pillow. She wipes away her tears with her

cigarette still in her hand.

Steve:	HEY...YOU OK?

The man kneels next to her, not knowing what to say. Stephen

sits down next to her and puts his hands on her shoulders.

Fran:	SO I GUESS WE FORGET ABOUT CANADA, RIGHT?

Steve:	(taking her in his arms)

Fran:	I GUESS NOBODY CARES ABOUT MY VOTE, HUH?

Steve:	COME ON, FRANNIE, YOU WERE SLEEPING.

Fran:	WHAT HAPPENED TO GROWING VEGETABLES AND FISHING?

She leans in to him, making a final plea.

Fran:	STEPHEN, LET'S JUST TAKE WHAT WE NEED AND KEEP

Steve:	WE CAN'T HARDLY CARRY ANYTHING IN THAT LITTLE BIRD.

Fran:	(angry)

Peter:	SHUT THAT THING OFF!

Roger clicks off the radio. They listen. They hear slight sounds

coming from the fire stairs. The end of the room with the

barricade of cartons looks surreal in the blue glow of the TV

screen which still shines.

Roger crawls over and clicks the TV off as well. The electronic

whistle slowly dies. Silence.

Steve steps out from behind the wall of cartons. Fran peers

around the corner to look, but she still sits on the floor.

Another noise. The faint squeaking of the door to the bottom of

the steps. Then footsteps on the metal stairs. Slow...

lumbering.

The faces of the humans all tighten. Peter and Roger pull their

rifles. Roger makes his ready.

Some thumping in the hall. Steve squats down and holds Fran.

The sounds are closer now. The door behind the cartons clicks

but does not move. More pounding...then silence.

After a time, the footsteps recede down the stairs.

Peter:	SOMEBODY BETTER SIT WATCH ALL THE TIME.

Roger:	THEY'LL NEVER GET THROUGH THERE.

Peter:	ENOUGH OF 'EM WILL. AND IT AIN'T JUST THEM THINGS

Roger:	WHAT ARE THEY GONNA DO? LAND ANOTHER PILOT TO FLY

Peter:	SOMEBODY FINALLY GOT IT, THOUGH. IT COMES DOWN TO

cigarette. Steve sits next to her again.

Steve:	FRANNIE...

She doesn't respond.

Steve:	DAMMIT, FRAN, YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES WE'D

Stephen curls up with his head on the rolled blanket.

Steve:	COME ON...GET SOME SLEEP.

The woman doesn't move.

Steve:	FRANNIE. COME ON.

She grinds her cigarette out on the concrete floor and stretches

out next to the man. He puts his arm around her. His hands rub

up and down her body as he curls next to her. He opens her

blouse and reaches inside. He closes his eyes and he seems

perfectly comfortable to rest in her softness. His hand moves

under her clothing. She doesn't respond, at first, then her body

relaxes somewhat and she brings one of her arms up around his

head.

Steve:	I'M NOT JUST BEING STUBBORN. I REALLY THINK THIS

She stares off across the barren room. His hands continues to

move under her blouse.

the corpses on the floor. One large and severely wounded

creature pounds on the door to the interior corridor. It had

been the one which was pounding at the door upstairs.

A female Zombie squats near one of the corpses in the hall. She

lifts its arm and moves it to her mouth, but she drops it

quickly, repelled by its coldness. She leans over and picks at

another corpse, then she stands and drifts towards the mall.

Slowly the creatures leaves the corridor and move out onto the

second floor balcony. We begin to hear a voice fading in over

the scene.

Voice:	...NOT ACTUALLY CANNIBALISM...CANNIBALISM IN THE

Some move down the stationary stairs onto the main concourse.

Voice:	THEY ATTACK AND...AND FEED...ONLY ON WARM HUMAN

Others still enter the enormous building. There are not as many

as there were in the afternoon, but there are certainly enough

to be threatening.

Voice:	INTELLIGENCE? SEEMINGLY LITTLE OR NO REASONING

eyes of the mannequins within the store seem to watch the

Zombies. The gate rattles but does not budge.

Voice:	THERE ARE REPORTS OF THE CREATURES USING TOOLS,

asleep on the blanket.

Voice:	THESE CREATURES ARE NOTHING BUT PURE, MOTORISED

The woman looks around. Morning sunlight is spilling in through

the skylights above. She sits up and peers into the next area of

the room. The men are gone. The television is playing. On the

tube we see a dishevelled man sitting in an emergency news room

reading the report.

pyramid is open. She realises that the men are on the roof.

garages of the building, he sees a fleet on enormous trailer-

trucks parked.

down into the room.

Roger:	HEY, FRAN...

Fran:	I WOULD HAVE MADE COFFEE AND BREAKFAST, BUT I

There is a bitterness in her voice. Roger laughs. Steve senses

the tension. Peter just straps on his equipment.

Fran:	CAN I SAY SOMETHING?

Steve:	SURE. WHAT DP YOU MEAN?

Fran:	I'M SORRY YOU FOUND OUT I'M PREGNANT, BECAUSE I

Steve:	HEY, FRANNIE, COME ON...

Fran:	AND,...I'M NOT GONNA BE DEN MOTHER FOR YOU GUYS.

They all look at her, attentive now.

Fran:	AND I WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON. AND I

Steve:	JESUS, FRAN...

Peter:	FAIR ENOUGH!

Fran:	NOW. WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

Peter:	WE'RE GOIN' OUT.

Fran starts to say something, but this time Peter cuts her off.

Peter:	...AND YOU ARE NOT COMING WITH US!

Again the woman starts to protest, but Peter continues.

Peter:	AND YOU WILL NOT COME WITH US UNTIL YOU CAN

The big man starts back up the pyramid. Roger moves to

follow him.

Fran:	SOMETHING ELSE.

The men look at her. She faces Roger and Peter directly without

looking at Stephen.

Fran:	I DON'T KNOW ANOUT YOU TWO, BUT I WANNA LEARN

Stephen is shocked. Fran looks at him and lowers her eyes.

Fran:	IF ANYTHING HAPPENS...WE'VE GOTTA BE ABLE TO GET

Stephen doesn't know what to say. He looks at the woman,

then up at the other men.

Peter:	SHE'S RIGHT, FLYBOY. COME ON, LET'S GO.

Fran:	AND YOU'RE NOT LEAVING ME WITHOUT A GUN AGAIN.

Stephen thinks about protesting but he complies by slowly

setting his rifle down on the cartons. Then he fishes in his

pocket for a fistful of shells and dumps them next to the gun.

He stares at the woman angry and hurt.

Fran picks up the weapon and shoots a glance up at Peter.

Fran:	I JUST MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO USE

Peter and Roger disappear through the skylight. Stephen stands

still. He looks down at the floor. Fran moves close to his side.

Fran:	I'M SORRY, STEPHEN. (it is not an apology)

Steve:	I KNOW...I KNOW...IT'S ALRIGHT!

He starts up to the skylight.

Fran:	STEPHEN

Steve:	YEAH.

He stops and turns to look at her. Her eyes are pleading for

understanding, but he is incapable of it at the moment. Fran

just shrugs off whatever she was going to say, and she sighs

with exasperation.

Fran:	BE CAREFUL.

Steve:	YEAH, WE'LL BE ALRIGHT.

He disappears through the skylight. Fran stares down at the

weapon in her hands, then she steps over and clicks off the

television.

Only Stephen is on board at the controls.

As Peter pulls his vehicle in a wide arc, Roger drives his right

up to the side of the building and roars toward the entrance

The gummy stuff flies into Roger's face. The Zombie falls limp,

but Roger is still desperate. The dead weight of the creature is

now on top of him, and the bloody wound runs. Roger is frantic.

He frees himself with great heaves of his body and he pushes the

creature out of the cab. The man's eyes are wide with revulsion.

He instantly brings up his sleeve to wipe the stains from his

face. He is quivering in extremes of emotions.

smashed through the cab window with a brick. Roger, still

shaking, dives down to the floor for his weapon.

Roger:	THE WINDOWS...OPEN YOUR WINDOW...YOUR WINDOW...

Peter dives across the cab and rolls down the passenger window.

Roger leans out his open window, trying to get his weapon into

Peter:	FOR CHRISSAKE COME ON!

Roger is still emotionally crazed. He leans out of his window in

a very vulnerable position. He is whooping like a child again as

he tries to level off another shot.

Suddenly, he's grabbed from behind by a Zombie and almost falls

out the window. He struggles to hold himself and keep a grip on

his gun. Peter leans over, trying to get a shot at the creature,

but can't get a clean sight. Roger grabs the window frames on

Peter's door and tries to pull himself up. Another creature

grabs him from behind.

Fran:	MONSTERS! MONSTERS!

She fires her gun.

It narrowly misses a creature. Fran fires again. Her shot tears

into the shoulder of the Zombie, but it doesn't stop him.

him back against the door of the cab.

Peter:	I MEAN IT! NOW YOU'RE NOT JUST PLAYIN' WITH

The two men stare at each other for a moment. Roger is startled

man's arm. Roger tears away, but blood appears at the wound.

Then Roger squares off a solid punch right to the Zombie's jaw.

The creature flies back and almost knocks over the Zombies

behind it. Roger jumps, making a grab for the window of Peter's

cab. The Zombies between the trucks, which Roger originally

kicked away, have regrouped. They advance and grab at the

struggling trooper. Roger's feet try to get hold on the side of

the door, but they slip.

hand gun.

Zombies are clutching at him. Again he swings up his legs and

kicks the creatures off balance. This time he manages to get his

feet locked against the door and Peter grabs the Troopers arm

with his free hand, but another Zombie is pulling at the man's

shirt and still another makes a grab for his legs.

Peter reaches out with his pistol and fires a point blank shot

at one of the clutching ghouls. It flies back and Roger is able

to pull himself higher. His torso is just about through the

window when another creature grabs him.

of the clutching Zombies is able to get a solid hold on Roger's

left leg. The creature opens its mouth and bites at the calf.

Blood appears. The creature bites again and this time it comes

Then it sits on the ground, looking like a gorilla. It still

has a bloody mass of flesh and material in its mouth. With its

hands it tries to separate the cloth from the more important

morsels.

Peter:	THAT'S IT.

Roger:	BULL SHIT.

Peter:	WE GOTTA DEAL WITH THAT LEG!

Roger:	I'M DEALIN' WITH IT...I'M DEALIN' WITH IT FINE!

Peter:	CAN YOU WALK ON IT NOW?

Roger:	YOUR DAMN RIGHT, I CAN...DAMN RIGHT, I CAN!

The wounded trooper struggles to wrap the bloody part of his leg

with a torn off piece of trouser. He can hardly keep from

screaming, and his words come out sharply and with great breaths

between them.

Roger:	I STOP MOVIN' THIS LEG...MAY NOT EVER GET IT GOIN'

and claw at the enormous vehicles but to no avail. Some try to

climb up onto the cabs. Others try to claw at the doors on the

trailers.

mall doors they cannot stand, so they have no leverage. The

creatures inside are pushing the doors out, so the Zombies under

the trucks cannot push them in. The doors swing both in and out,

so it is very clear that some access could be had by the

creatures if they were more organised.

One creature, having crawled under a trailer, does manage to

push open a mall door. The thing crawls into the building

through the legs of other ghouls which are trying to exit. They

behave as a swarm of insects.

The revolving door offers the best access for the creatures,

although its inherent complexity is baffling to their empty

brains. Two creatures do manage to crawl under the truck which

blocks the revolving door, and one of them negotiates the

rotating action and enters the concourse.

They are back in the crawl space. The cartons are still piled

against the firestair entrance.

the commotion, starts through the open entrance arch.

Peter is trying to unsling his rifle. Stephen conquers his fear

of the height, and lets himself fall to the floor. He crumples

up when he hits, and rolls into a store exhibit, knocking things

flying.

Peter manages to level off his gun and shoots the rushing

creature. Stephen regains his footing. The second creature is

moving up the aisle. Stephen grabs a powerful crossbow from a

nearby exhibit. It is loaded. It fires with a strumming sound

and the small shaft rips cleanly through the creature's skull

and imbeds itself in a wall beyond. The Zombie walks forward a

few steps before it falls.

he swings it down fast. Stephen catches the cage below and slams

it into place just as another ghoul falls against it moaning and

clawing.

Stephen unslings his gun and is about to level it off on the

creature outside. Peter jumps down from the counter.

Peter:	DON'T TRY TO SHOOT THROUGH THOSE GATES.

The Zombie crashes all its might against the metal cage.

Stephen startles.

Peter:	HE CAN'T GET THROUGH...COME ON...

Department Store. They all wear new double holsters containing

hand guns. Each has a rifle strapped over his shoulder and

another in hand. They wear ammo belts and carry packs with

other supplies. The wounded Roger is sitting in the big

gardening cart which Peter earlier used to carry the first

supply load out of the store. Peter runs, pushing the cart

before him.

There are only a few creatures on the balcony. The dead things

turn in confusion at the sound of the attacking commandos.

Roger, his hands free to shoot, fires his weapon several times

at some of the creatures who are closest.

Peter pulls up to a screeching halt at the gate. He turns the

cart in a full 180 so that Roger is facing out toward the mall.

Steve fumbles with the second lock. Peter faces the few Zombies

which are converging along the balcony. He lift his new

Super-gun and stares through the scope. The gun roars

eloquently. Even its sound pronounces its power. The single

shot rips cleanly through the centre-forehead of one of the

creatures.

The man aims at another head. Blam. Another perfect kill. Then a

third. Roger fires several times.

Fran stands ready at the roll gate. As Stephen finishes with the

final lock, the woman pushes against the cage and it starts up.

Steve stands, and the two roll the cage into the ceiling, but

Stephen is careful not to let it get out of his grasp.

Fran moves into the store and Peter pulls the cart behind him.

Then Steve, Peter and Fran pull the gate shut long before any of

the advancing creatures reach the area.

Peter:	HOW'S THE RIDE?

Roger:	KIND BUMPY. WATCH IT.

The stern Black face stares down at the back of the wounded

man's head. Despite his attempt at humour, the stiffness in

Roger's body evidences his pain. Peter puts his hand squarely

on the Trooper's shoulder.

Peter:	LOOK HERE...I...

Roger:	I KNOW, I KNOW...SHUT UP.

Something very serious is shared between the two men, some

knowledge which we do not fully understand. We do see the

Again the Zombies follow and again Fran is ready with the torch.

Fran waves the torches closer and the creatures back away.

Steve un-locks the middle lock.

but Fran's torches make them hold back slightly. Steve grabs

one of the propane canisters with one hand and draws a pistol

with the other. Fran draws a hand gun also. The two fire into

the pack of Zombies. One or two fall. The others try to move

in but are afraid of the bright flames. One gets close to Steve

but the man blasts his torch directly into its face. Its hair

catches on fire and the creature throws itself wildly about,

knocking other Zombies back.

Roger holds on to the sides. They crash through the scattered

pack of ghouls successfully and Peter makes for the car exhibit.

There are a few creatures on the concourse on the cart's path.

Peter:	(shouting)

The Zombies at Stephen's back are very close. Steve lunges at

them with his torch. They back off slightly.

The creatures on the concourse are approaching the cart. A

the gate which he can lift just high enough with the single

lock undone.

Another ghoul grabs Steve from behind. This time Steve's torch

is knocked flying and rolls away. Fran is desperate. She tries

to aim her pistol but cannot shoot through the grill. She holds

her torch high.

Steve kicks and scrambles, rolling on the floor. The Zombies

are on him. He manages to knock one or two of them to the

floor. Then he fires with his pistol, killing another, He

crawls to the torch and grabs it, the creatures clutching and

tugging at his pants and shirt.

The Trooper's face contorts in agony as he moves himself into

the rear of the corridor, more lumber is wedged against walls

framework for reinforcement. On the frame's face a masonite

panel is nailed into place on one side. Peter works in the

corridor. He is carefully nailing in a moulding which makes the

new partition look like a finished wall.

In the corridor, there are power tools lying about and a vast

array of other hardware in the gardening cart. Fran appears from

out of the washrooms. She is carrying an old can of paint which

has obviously been used.

Fran:	THIS MUST HAVE BEEN FOR TOUCH UP...IT LOOKS

Peter grabs the can and pries it open quickly with a screw

driver. He dips his finger into the liquid and smears some onto

the new wall where it butts against the corridor. It is a

perfect match.

Steve:	(to Fran) ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT BEFORE WE CLOSE

Fran:	NO...

The woman is staring down the corridor toward the mall proper.

They are piled together at the corridor mouth on the balcony.

It is a grisly sight. Fran turns away.

She steps back through the unfinished partition, leans against

the framework. Her hand goes to her mouth as she tries to choke

back a gag. Steve moves up behind her, but she feels another

wave of nausea and she darts for the washroom. Steve sets down

his hammer and follows.

hand falls on her back.

Fran:	LEAVE ME ALONE...IT'S ALRIGHT...IT'S MY PROBLEM.

Steve:	FRANNIE...

Fran:	JUST GET OUTA HERE, STEPHEN...I DON'T WANT YOU

The man doesn't move. Fran reaches up, taking his hand. She

clutches it tightly, indicating that she is not angry.

Fran:	I DON'T WANT YOU TO SEE ME THIS WAY...

Another wave hits her and she wretches again. She pulls her

hand back leaning over the toilet bowl.

Fran:	PLEASE GO...I'M ALRIGHT...PLEASE...

Stephen stands up reluctantly and drift out of the room. The

woman wretches but she is dry. She tries to swallow. Then sits

on the floor next to the toilet holding her stomach. She

fumbles with the flush handle, depressing it. The rushing water

makes an ugly sound. Fran looks down at her stomach thinking of

her pregnancy.

The camera pulls off Peter's face. We see that his rifle is

stretched across his lap. The TV drones on from the other room.

Scientist:   IN CO-OPERATION WITH THE MOBILE UNITS OF THE O.B.P.

We see now what Peter is staring at. On the floor, twenty feet

away lies the corpse of Roger. It's face is covered with a

blanket. It lies very still.

The man's voice is heard almost shouting over the voices from

the studio. The angry staff protests vigorously, with

emotional language...

Scientist:   THIS COLLECTION COULD BE...STORED...RATIONED...

The shouts of anger continue.

Suddenly the dead Roger's foot seems to move under the blanket.

and legs of the other bodies make the room look like a

Renaissance Painting of hell itself. There is the familiar

gunshot wound in Roger's forehead.

The heavy door of the vault closes with a metallic slam which

echoes through out the mall.

Fran:	ADAM! NO NO!

The woman's hands reach into frame and grab the little animal.

She carries it through the room and drops it on some papers laid

out in an unused part of the storage area.

Fran's stomach is big now, her pregnancy evident. She wipes her

brow like an exhausted housewife, and shuffles back into the

Fran:	THERE HASN'T BEEN A BROADCAST FOR THREE DAYS.

Steve:	THEY MIGHT COME BACK ON.

Fran angrily throws down her silverware and stomps over to the

TV. She clicks it off. The woman returns to the table.

Steve stands up and moves to the set. He clicks it back on.

Peter watches the two sheepishly. It is a domestic scene. The

Peter:	RAIDERS.

The little puppy scrambles up to Fran's feet, seeking attention.

She picks the little dog up in her arms.

Fran:	WELL, IF THERE'S ONLY THREE OF THEM...

Peter:	WHO SAYS?

There's a long silence. The radio sputters static. Voices are

Peter cuts him off.

Peter:	SHHHH! QUIET!

He is trying to hear the muffled conversation.

Fran:	I THINK WE SHOULD...

Peter:	JESUS CHRIST, SHUT UP AND LISTEN!

More static. Slight laughter is heard. Steve looks into Peter's

Finally, the voice again.

Peter:	COME ON, MAN...GET IT UP.

Fran:	STEPHEN!

Steve:	WE'RE JUST GONNA SHUT THE GATES.
