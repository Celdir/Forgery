INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

A coffee shop somewhere in New Mexico. MICKEY KNOX, his back

turned to us, is sitting at the counter finishing his meal. We

hear the PING...BANG...of a pinball machine being played OFF

SCREEN.

MABEL, a waitress, comes over and fills Mickey's coffee cup.

Mabel turns to her right.

CAMERA PULLS BACK and we see for the first time MALLORY KNOX,

Mickey's wife, sitting on a counter stool next to him. Her back

is to the camera as well.

Mabel exits FRAME.

Mallory hops from the stool, walks over and grabs the JAR next

to the cash register, then dumping out the coins on the counter,

she selects a quarter.

Mallory saunters past the COWBOY playing pinball. As his eyes

follow Mallory, he loses his ball.

She walks to the jukebox in the back, inserts the quarter,

selects a song, punches the buttons, a needle lands on a record,

and a good God almighty rockabilly tune cuts through the coffee

shop.

Mabel brings Mickey his pie and milk.

CAMERA moves around to a CU of Mickey. This is the first time

we see him. As he takes a bite of green pie:

Mallory starts doing a slow seductive fandango around the coffee

shop. She's really cooking and smoking.

Pinball Cowboy and Mabel are starting to wonder just who the

hell these people are.

Mickey isn't paying much attention. He's too busy enjoying his

pie and milk.

EXT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

A dirty pickup truck, sporting a Confederate flag decal, pulls

up to the coffee shop. SONNY, OTIS, and EARL, three

tough-looking rednecks, pile out. Steam rises from beneath the

pickup's hood.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

The LOUDNESS of the Rockabilly song slaps Sonny and Otis in

their faces as they walk inside the door. The sexy sight of

Mallory doing the ubang stomp stops them in their tracks.

Otis and Sonny exchange looks.

Otis heads toward Mallory. Sonny moves over to the counter next

to Mickey.

Otis stands in front of Mallory, trying to copy what she's

doing. Her eyes are closed at the moment, so she doesn't see

him.

Mabel sets the Miller down in front of Sonny. Sonny takes a

swig, enjoying the floor show.

Mickey turns from his pie and looks at Sonny. His expression

betrays nothing.

The needle lifts off the record. The song ends.

Mallory opens her eyes and sees Otis.

Otis gives her his best shit-eating grin before turning to

Sonny.

Sonny gurgles out a laugh.

Otis turns to Mallory as she PUNCHES him hard in the face

spinning him around.

Sonny spews his mouthful of Highlife.

Mallory grabs the back of Otis' head and SMASHES it down on the

table, cracking the linoleum.

Otis buckles, dropping to his knees.

Sonny jumps off the counter stool, but Mickey's hand clutches

hold of his shoulder.

Sonny spins around toward Mickey, loaded for bear, and points

his finger at him, threateningly.

Before any threat can be made, Mickey whips a large buck knife

out from its sheath, and in a flash, SLICES off Sonny's finger.

Sonny's finger drops on his boot. He grabs his aching hand.

Blood flows from the wound.

Mickey makes five lightning quick SLASHING SWINGS. The buck

knife slips back into its sheath. At first, there seems to be

no difference with Sonny. Finally, blood flows from the slices

made in his face and chest. Sonny collapses.

The SHORT-ORDER COOK charges out of the kitchen at Mickey,

wielding a meat cleaver and screaming.

Mickey whips out a .45 automatic from a shoulder holster inside

his jacket and FIRES.

BULLET'S POV: Heading fast toward Short-Order Cook's face. It

HITS. Short-Order Cook puts his hands to his face and falls to

the ground, screaming.

Mickey spots Earl, who's standing outside the plate glass

window. Earl's watched the whole shebang.

Earl mouths 'Fuck!' He turns and runs for it.

Mickey hurls the knife through the plate glass window, which

SHATTERS. The knife PLUNGES deep into Earls back. He hits the

ground dead.

Mickey turns to Mallory. She's sitting on op of Otis, SLAMMING

his head repeatedly on the floor.

Mallory looks up at Mickey. She gets off Otis and moves to

Mickey's side.

Mickey trains his .45 on Pinball Cowboy, who's shaking in his

cowboy boots. Mickey aims at Mabel, who's clutching the coffee

pot, crying.

Mallory does eanie, meanie, minie, moe, pointing back and forth

from Mabel to Pinball Cowboy.

She ends, pointing at Mabel. Mabel's crying. She screams.

Mickey FIRES the .45. The bullet CHINKS through the coffee pot

Mabel's holding and explodes, THUNKING her in the chest. She

hits the floor dead.

Mickey and Mallory join hands and walk over to the Pinball

Cowboy who stands in a pool of his own urine.

Pinball Cowboy nods yes.

The two killers plant a big wet kiss on each other's mouths.

Then, holding hands, Mickey and Mallory walk out of the cafe.

As we read the remarks, we hear a DOCTOR'S VOICE read aloud.

INSERT: INT. A PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - DAY

Wurlitzer shakes hands with Scagnetti.

They all laugh.

INT. JAIL - VISITING AREA - DAY

WAYNE GAYLE, a young, energetic, commando journalist a'la

Geraldo Rivera is sitting on the visitor side of the county jail

visiting area. Wayne is alone and the visiting area is empty.

Apparently some arrangement was made for the visit. Wayne has a

miniature tape recorder in his hand and is testing it.

Wayne shuts off the recorder, rewinds and plays it back. It

works beautifully. He hits the record button and conceals the

recorder in his sport coat jacket.

The door opens on the prisoner side and Mickey Knox is lead into

the room by two SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES. Mickey's wearing the country

jail blue jump-suit. He has a thick and wide leather belt around

his waist with a metal ring built into each side. Long sturdy

chains with handcuffs on each end are wrapped across his body

and through the rings, binding his arms to his sides. His hands

and feet are double cuffed.

The Deputies both have their guns drawn, ready to blow Mickey in

half at the slightest provocation. For a man wrapped and bound

in chains, Mickey seems strangely in control of his environment.

Even restrained as he is by the symbols of society (the chains,

jail, guards, guns, jump-suit), he remains a dangerous,

intimidating, and fascinating figure.

Wayne takes in the image of Mickey.

Mickey's roughly shoved into his seat on the prisoner's side of

the glass. The Deputies move to their place, off to the side by

the wall.

Wayne pauses and retorts.

Mickey is silent.

Mickey shakes his head no.

No response from Mickey.

Mickey cracks a smile.

The guards come over to take him away.

They grab Mickey, and jerk him from the chair. Wayne stands.

Mickey doesn't respond. He just leaves with the guards.

INT. MICKEY'S CELL - DAY

The sound of the Coupe de Ville swells until we...

INT. A BEDROOM - NIGHT

The screen erupts with fire. Mickey and Mallory's faces appear

INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

MEDIUM CU of Wayne holding a piece of paper in front of his face

and reading from it out loud. We hear Wayne's VOICE over

Mallory's singing before the last scene DISSOLVES.

Wayne drops the letter down from in front of his face.

We now see the restaurant adorned with the standard Denny's

decorum. Wayne's team is gathered in a booth that surrounds the

remains of a greasy meal. In response to his last remark, they

all pretend they are praying to him.

The team consists of SCOTT, the cameraman, who wears wild

t-shirts (presently a t-shirt with the movie 'She Devils On

Wheels' splashed on the front); ROGER, the soundman, who wears

wild Hawaiian shirts and Bermuda shorts; and UNRULY JULIE,

Wayne's assistant, a young lady who wears Bermuda shorts, a

baseball jersey, and a dark sports coat no matter how hot the

weather is at any time. Roger's never seen without his

recorder, Scott's never without his camera, and Unruly Julie

always has her giant notebook. These dishevelled film types are

all in their twenties and are a marked contrast to Wayne's

stylish yuppie demeanour.

Unruly Julie pops the cork on a champagne bottle. The guys hold

out coffee mugs, while Julie fills. Julie, however drinks

straight from the bottle.

NOTE: This scene is to be played at a rapid fire 'His Girl

Friday' pace.

Everybody laughs.

As Wayne talks, Unruly Julie writes furiously in her notebook.

She never speaks, just writes.

Wayne's team all spit out mouthfuls of champagne.

Unruly Julie scribbles in her notebook. Wayne snaps at Scott.

Scott closes his eyes in concentration, and repeats Wayne.

except Wayne, who's in another sweater and looks alert and snappy.

Wayne and Unruly Julie grab chairs and sit.

CU of video monitor screen. We see a show rewinding.

her left hand is trained on Wurlitzer.

Mickey's left hand masters the shotgun leash on Wayne, while he

monitors the Deputies with the CAMERA on his right shoulder.

NOTE: The following scene will intercut between VIDEO FOOTAGE

and COLOR 35mm.

Wayne starts belting out his speech as Mickey focus the CAMERA

on Wurlitzer. Duncan simply cries and begs for his life to be

spared.

Mickey knew what he was doing. This has an effect on the

deputies.

The wall of deputies starts moving backward.

The Knoxs and their hostages start moving forward with Wayne

yelling all the way.

The deputies keep their guns trained on the caravan, but they

keep giving ground, until they reach the doors of the front

lobby and they begin to part like the Red Sea.

Wurlitzer stands his ground.

The caravan marches forth. Wayne and Duncan keep shouting their

speeches. Nobody dares to move on them, but the deputies keep

their weapons ready.

Wayne stops his speech to take a breath.

Wayne starts up again.

The deputies are completely frustrated. Mickey and Wurlitzer

are nose to nose.

Mickey leaves FRAME.

EXT. COUNTY JAIL - DAY

The doors swing wide in SLOW MOTION as the caravan of Mickey,

Mallory, Wayne and Duncan take their first step into the open

air.

A crescent of deputies frame the group in the B.G. while

Wurlitzer stands, defeated, just behind Mickey.

FREEZE FRAME on WIDE ANGLE.

LEADER.

EXT. WOODS - DAY

The WHITE LEADER is disrupted by a fogged image in BLACK &

WHITE. The image settles into a ECU of Wayne. He's being

filmed by a 16mm CAMERA that he is presently balancing on a

fence post.

This entire SCENE is played out cinema verite. The SOUND is not

in sync as Wayne steps back into a MED SHOT. He looks directly

into the CAMERA.

Mickey screams O.S.

Wayne steps forward and picks up the CAMERA and while conducting

his interview, the CAMERA remains hand held.

CAMERA focuses on Mallory sitting on a stump, while Mickey paces

in and out of FRAME in the B.G.

Mickey can be heard faintly in the B.G.

Mickey's snapping his fingers in the B.G.

Mickey approaches Wayne. CAMERA goes a little haywire as Wayne

lowers it from his eye.

Mickey takes the CAMERA from Wayne, and while he speaks, he

balances it on a fence post.

Wayne forces a chuckle. Mickey steps away from the CAMERA and into

a THREE SHOT. The NEWS VAN is parked in the B.G.

Mickey pumps the slide of his shotgun. Mallory grabs her

shotgun from off the ground.

Wayne is shaking.

Wayne is grasping for anything.

Mickey turns to Mallory.

The two interview subjects start PUMPING rounds into Wayne,

who's body dances like a puppet before collapsing to the ground.

Mickey and Mallory kiss each other passionately, then climbing

into the news van, they drive away.

Wayne's body lay peacefully in FRAME until the CAMERA

eventually runs out of film.
