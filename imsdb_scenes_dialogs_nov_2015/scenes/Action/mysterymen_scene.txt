THEME AND CREDITS...

FADE IN:

EXT.  ERIE HOSPITAL FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE - DAY

CAMERA MOVES THROUGH a tangled jungle of razor wire, finally COMING

INTO VIEW of a foreboding, fortress-like old institution, surrounded by

towers and gun turrets.  Screaming and horrible laughter is heard from

within...

CLOSE ON a sign that reads "Erie Hospital for the Criminally Insane"

... This is where the worst killers and psychos go.

INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

THE CAMERA PANS THE EXPRESSIONLESS FACES of the REVIEW BOARD as

CASANOVA FRANKENSTEIN sits across from them.  Dressed in an

immaculately tailored prison smock (with "Casanova" exquisitely

embroidered above the pocket), he sits contritely as DOCTOR EMMET

BIERCE, the hospital's fatherly Chief of Psychiatry, presents his case.

CASANOVA, the picture of remorse and repentance.

ON SEVERAL OF THE BOARD getting misty eyed at the memory of that

brilliant performance...

ON DOCTOR ANABEL LEEK, the hospital's icily beautiful, ultra cool, top

shrink.

A moment later Casanova addresses them... His manner is charming,

sincere, his voice soft, filled with emotion.  He is a master of

seduction.

Doctor Bierce wipes the tears from his eyes.  Reactions from the board,

moved, as Casanova weeps convulsively.  Doctor Leek shows no reaction.

Tears plop dawn the cheeks of the review board as the FULLY

ORCHESTRATED STRAINS OF "WHEN YOU WALK THROUGH A STORM" SWELL...

SERIES OF SHOTS - AS THE MUSIC CONTINUES

A hand stamps Casanova's file "CURED"... Casanova shakes hands and

embraces the tearful members of the review board, finishing with a

paternal hug from Doctor Bierce.

In his cell a guard delivers Casanova his favorite old disco suit

(that's been waiting far him for twenty years).

Casanova, dressed in the suit, walks down the central aisle of the

lock-up... A moment later he steps out of the massive gates of the

hospital, and takes his first deep breath of freedom... while in an

office window high above Bierce and the members of the review board

stand watching, very proud...

But suddenly THE MUSIC CHANGES TO SEVENTIES DISCO as a black Ferrari

drives up, and Doctor Leek, now dressed very sexily, gets out... As the

review board watches in stunned silence, Casanova and Anabel perform a

nifty little disco twirl, finishing with a very lewd kiss...

Bierce, watching, realizes he's been duped... as Casanova, grinning up

at him, puts a long gold chain (his favorite weapon) around his neck...

Bierce, horrified, picks up the telephone... as Casanova and Anabel get

in the car.

INT.   THE CAR - A MOMENT LATER

Casanova and Anabel drive off.  The massive old hospital is seen

through the rear window behind them, as Casanova calmly looks at his

watch...

CLOSE ON HIS WATCH -

as the second hand just swings toward the twelve.  It is exactly twelve

noon...

BACK ON CASANOVA -

And the hospital EXPLODES in a HUGE FIREBALL that completely consumes

it.

EXT.  THE ROAD - DAY

The Ferrari drives past and the CAMERA HOLDS ON a sign that reads

"We1come to Champion City, home of Captain Amazing". The city itself, a

crumbling rust belt metropolis (ala Detroit) can be seen stretched out

along the shore of Lake Champion off in the distance...

INSIDE THE CAR - CONTINUOUS - ON CASANOVA

BACK ON THE ROAD  - CONTINUOUS

The Ferrari drives under a much larger billboard that looms over the

road, showing a picture of Captain Amazing himself, a square jawed

classic superhero, staring fiercely into the camera.  The caption reads

"Crime.  Don't even think about it."

EXT.  TRAIN YARDS OF CHAMPION CITY - NIGHT

Letters read "Six months later"...

as the CAMERA EXPLORES the desolate muddy terrain of the train yards,

CRUISING past piles of tires and abandoned train cars...

CAMERA PICKS UP a battered van as it drives through the yard, then

pulls up beside an old boxcar.  The back of the van is thrown open, a

ramp is thrown down, and THE RED EYES, a gang of vicious small time

thieves (all of whom wear sunglasses with red lenses) start unloading

their night's haul... RED EYE 1 drives a golf cart, with clubs, down

the ramp.

Several more Red Eyes emerge carrying a sawn off bike rack with bikes

still attached, a barber pole, a Virgin Mary lawn statue, and a top of

the line baby stroller... while their leader, BIG RED, stands in the

door to the boxcar, watching approvingly.

The Red Eyes laugh... as Red Eye 3 takes the cover off the baby

stroller and sees... that there's a BABY still in it.

The crooks gather around the baby, a jolly little kid who just laughs

at them.

The others think that's a great idea, but Big Red doesn't.

The others hadn't thought of that.

The others think that's a good idea and look around for a brick.

But suddenly there is another presence... A man in a blue turban and

cape with the initials "BR" on his chest has appeared... He is THE BLUE

RAJA.

Another man steps into the light.  He wears a construction helmet and

mask.  There is an "S" on his chest, and he carries an old shovel.  He

is THE SHOVELER.

He brandishes his shovel for effect.  The Red Eyes look at these two,

highly amused.

A third man steps out.  His costume is less dramatic than the others.

He wears only an old leather jacket and a faded, torn shirt with flames

on it, but the fierce look on his face and the atrociousness of his

haircut make it very clear that he is the craziest and most dangerous

of the three.  He is MISTER FURIOUS.

The crooks howl with laughter.

Big Red turns to the others and shakes with pretended fear.

The Red Eyes laugh, but suddenly, a small silver projectile whizzes

through the air and implants itself in Big Red's backside.  He howls

with pain, pulls it out and examines it... It's a silver dessert fork.

The Raja holds up his hands, each of which hold a spread of silver

forks.

Big Red gives a shrill whistle, and a dozen more Red Eyes step out of

an old caboose... including MIKEY, a four hundred pound behemoth.  He

is eating a container of Ben and Jerry's like it was an ice cream cone,

taking huge bites out of it, container and all.

RAJA AND SHOVELER, reacting... Gulp.  This was more than they'd

bargained for.  But Furious just growls; he's game.

The Red Eyes attack... Mister Furious goes into a furious face; his

hair stands out straight and he rushes right into the oncoming

crooks...

A Red Eye takes a swing at the Shoveler--but he simply puts up his

shovel and lets the crook slug the shovel's pan.  The crook yelps with

pain and shakes his battered hand... as the Raja fends off crooks,

poking them with salad forks... and the baby sits in his stroller,

watching and laughing, really enjoying the show.  (There's no real

martial artistry or teamwork here; this is a classic back alley

brouhaha.)

But there's too many of then... The Raja goes down under swinging

fists... and so does the Shoveler...

Furious holds his own, taking out crooks with powerful lefts and

rights--until Mikey runs him down like a truck, falling right on top of

him and crushing him under his massive weight.

Mikey, sweating, bears down... but suddenly, a calm, very authoritative

voice is heard.

Everything suddenly stops, as the Red Eyes look up and see... CAPTAIN

AMAZING standing on tap of the boxcar, hands on hips, framed in the

light at the moon, his biceps bulging, his state of the art physique

sculpted body armor gleaming in the moonlight, his cape wafting

heroically in the wind.  He is superhero perfection incarnate.

ON THE RED EYES as their viciousness turns instantly to panic...

Big Red and a couple others try to run for it, but Amazing leaps ca-

like off the boxcar and is on them in a flash.  As the baby claps his

hands in delight, and our three heroes watch in beat-up awe, Amazing

deftly takes out the crooks with expert punches and effortlessly

delivered elbows and kicks. He is the consumate superhero, and he

doesn't even break a sweat.

The remaining Red Eyes drop to their knees and throw up their hands in

surrender.

Police cars and a TV truck come screeching into the train yard... and

the scene is suddenly flooded vith light and swarming with cops and

reporters...

Our three heroes try to approach Captain Amazing (who still looks fresh

as a daisy).

But Amazing just walks past them, ignoring them completely, as if they

didn't even exist.  He goes to greet DAWN WONG (Champion City's answer

to Connie Chung).

Our heroes just watch, feeling ignored, humiliated.  Furious growls.

Suddenly, TWO COPS are accosting them.

The cops crack up.  Furious growls at them.  The cops yank out their

nightsticks.

Shoveler and Raja pull Furious away before he gets into real trouble...

The cops watch as our three heroes disappear into the night.

EXT.  THE LAKESIDE DINER - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING

An inner city greasy spoon.

INT.  THE DINER - CONTINUOUS - CLOSE ON A TV SCREEN

on which Captain Amazing, the laughing baby in his arms, is being

interviewed by Dawn Wong.  He's playing the cutsy photo op for all its

worth, gootchy-gooing the kid, etc.  Dawn is creaming.

Our three heroes sit at a booth in the back of the diner, watching the

tube...

Furious picks up the newspaper on which there is a photo of a good

looking guy in a tux at a benefit... The headline reads "Lance Hunt

Hosts Benefit."  He holds the picture up next to the television, so the

faces of Lance Hunt and Captain Amazing are side by side.  It is

obviously the same guy.

A depressed silence.  Furious turns his attention to the napkin

dispenser.

A WAITRESS is standing at the table.

They look at her, taken aback.  She's very pretty.

CLOSE ON FURIOUS, smitten by her, but almost afraid to look at her.

Under all that rage, he's in fact shy.

Furious growls.

A moment later as Monica walks away, Furious can't help but

watch her.  The Raja replaces the diner's dinnerware with the good

stuff from his coat.

Monica stands at the counter placing her order.  Furious approaches

her, leans against the counter.  For a moment he just stands there,

fuming, unable to think of anything to say. She isn't sure what to make

of this.

She shrugs.

She's visibly turned off by that.

EXT.  OUTSIDE THE DINER - LATER

Furious, the Raja, and the Shoveler step out.

Furious kicks his engine started and speeds off into the night as the

Shoveler opens the door of his battered Ford Esquire station wagon, and

the Raja gets into his ancient Datsun.

EXT.  RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

The Shoveler pulls into the driveway of his very modest house. The

front yard looks like a battle zone.  Bikes and kids' junk are

everywhere.

LIVING ROOM - A MOMENT LATER

as big a disaster area as the front yard. His kids, EDDIE JR. (15),

LENORE (12), BUTCH (10), TRACY (7), and ROLAND (5) are all sprawled in

front of the television. The Shoveler enters, and his kids don't even

bother to look up from the tube.

ON THE SHOVELER, silent, hurt.

The kids all laugh (in that derisive way that kids do so well) as the

Shoveler dejectedly walks into the kitchen.

INT.  KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER

The Shoveler enters, dejected.  His wife, Lucille, is doing the dishes.

She looks up, sees him.

He nods.

EXT.  THE RAJA'S HOUSE - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING

The Raja's Datsun is parked in front of a neat as a pin little

Victorian house.

INT.  THE DINING ROOM - NIGHT

The room is dark.  Someone is sneaking around.  A drawer is quietly

opened, and we hear the gentle clink of silver. Suddenly, the light

goes on and we see the Blue Raja, now dressed in a sport shirt and

slacks, with his hand in the drawer.  His MOTHER, in her nightclothes,

stands by the door where she has just switched on the light.

She just looks at him, very suspicious.

He kisses her and goes into the next room.  CAMERA HOLDS ON MOM; she

doesn't trust him.

EXT.  HILLTOP - NIGHT - ANGLE ON

A billboard overlooking the city.  Captain Amazing is posed wearing a

pair of bright blue Nikes.  The caption reads. "It's a nice world.

Sonebody's got to save it... The Nike Supershoe.  It's Amazing."

Furious sits on his Harley, taking long hauls from a pint bottle of

cheap bourbon and gazing up at the sign.

A moment of despondency, and then he hears a strange sound overhead and

looks up...

HIS POV -

as something suddenly flies across the star filled night sky above

him...

It is Captain Amazing, wearing a high tech rocket pack on his back...

SERIES OF SHOTS - WITH MUSIC

as Furious, following Captain Amazing, rides roughshod down the steep

hill, skidding onto a road and then speeding through a residential

area...

He cuts onto some railroad tracks, hops his bike up on a rail, and

rides smoothly along it, following Amazing... He turns off the tracks,

rides roughly through some woods, then emerges from the trees and

sees..

A foreboding looking old mansion... Captain Amazing lands on the

highest part of its roof... Furious pulls up, gazes at the front gates

of the mansion...

HIS POV -

Letters across the iron gates read... "Frankenstein".

EXT.  ON THE ROOF - CONTINUOUS

Captain Amazing abandons his jet pack and moves across the old slate

roof like Spiderman, leaping nimbly from gable to gable and walking

along a high ridge like a tight rope walker. Finally he approaches a

skylight, looks down and sees...

A huge old library with an iron catwalk running around it. Casanova

Frankenstein sits in a club chair by a roaring tire. Anabel perches on

the arm of his chair.  In the other chair sits a once good looking, now

paunchy guy, with a meticulously coiffed haircut.  He is TONY

POMPADOUR, head of the infamous Disco Boys.

0N CAPTAIN AMAZING

He sees that the skylight is open, and quietly lets himself in...

INT.  THE LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

Casanova and Tony P savor glasses of brandy and puff on big cigars.

Casanova accepts this graciously.

Casanova and Tony P look up and see Captain Amazing, posed noncalantly

on the iron catwalk, gazing down at them.  Tony P jumps out of his

chair, scared.  But Casanova just smiles at his ancient rival, cool as

a cucumber.

Tony P makes a move for his pistol, but Captain Amazing instantly whips

out his pistol, getting the drop on him.

Tony freezes.

Nervous reaction from Tony P.

Icy reaction from Anabel.

Casanova suddenly throws a secret breaker switch, and the ugly hum of a

million volts instantly fills the room...

EXT.  OUTSIDE THE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS - ON FURIOUS

still watching... as all the lights in the house go out, except for a

frightening orange glow in an upper room...

Off in the distance Furious sees... the lights of the entire city

flicker and then black out... A moment later the mansion, and the

city's lights return to normal... as Furious watches, not sure what to

make of this.

EXT. STREET CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

Traffic is snarled.  Horns are blasting.  Tempers are frayed.

CLOSE ON A HAMMERING JACKHAMMER... CAMERA WIDENS TO REVEAL that it is

being operated by the Shoveler, dressed in work clothes.  Wiped out

from the night before, the vibrations of the hamer are lulling him off

to sleep... He nods out... as his BOSS whacks him on the arm.

EXT.  THE RAJA'S HOUSE - DAY - ESTABLISHING

INT.  THE RAJA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The Raja lies sprawled on his bed, depressed, still in his pee jays, as

he watches... an ANTHONY ROBBINS infomercial ON THE TV.

EXT.  SALLY'S AUTO DEMOLITION - DAY - ESTABLISHING

An auto junkyard and demotion yard.

EXT.  THE YARD - DAY

A giant press mashes an old car... while nearby Mister Furious does the

job by hand, demolishing an old Grand Prix with an iron bar.  He does

it as easily as a normal guy would tear apart a corrugated box, ripping

off the doors, then tearing off the bumpers and the hood and tossing

the pieces onto a big pile... His big boned, red faced boss SALLY is

calling out to him.

EXT.  THE BACK OF THE YARD - A MINUTE LATER

In a weedy overgrown far corner of the junkyard Sally and Furious stand

looking a big old hunk of a military vehicle. It is a Herkimer Battle

Jitney, a heavily armored, windowless, soundproof, personnel carrier

(designed by the Pentagon in the fifties to take congressmen on

battlefield fact finding tours).  Overgrown with weeds, home to an

extended family of pigeons, its fighting days (if it ever had any) are

over.

She walks away.  Furious growls.  He picks up his iron bar and is about

to wedge it under the front bumper of the Herkimer...

HIS POV -

But the big old headlights and the sad old grill seem to be looking at

hint, imploring him for one last chance...

And he just can't do it.  He throws away his iron bar and climbs inside

the cab of the Herkimer...

IN THE CAB - CONTINUOUS

Furious sits behind the wheel and tenderly touches its beat-up old

dashboard, then turns on the radio, which, miraculously still works.

He tunes in a local station, puts his feet up on the dash.

ON FURIOUS, taking immediate notice.

INT.  THE DINER - NIGHT

Furious, the Shoveler, and the Raja all sit at their booth.

Furious groans.

ON THE TV -

Casanova is being interviewed by DON STOUFFER, the local Mike Wallace.

CLOSE ON A MODEL of a huge concrete bunker-like institutional structure

(i.e.  the Getty)

BACK ON FURIOUS, RAJA, and SHOVELER -

EXT.  FRANKENSTEIN MANSION - NIGHT - ANGLE ON

the wall of the estate... as our heroes' three heads rise up over

it... and survey the grounds.

THEIR POV -

A group of men are hanging around the door to the house, smoking,

chatting, and laughing.  A CLOSER ANGLE REVEALS that they are all

dressed in the height (or depths) of seventies disco fashion.  One of

them is showing off some steps.

Our heroes fall back behind the safety of the wall and confer.

They share an exasperated look, then scramble over the wall after him.

INT.  CASANOVA'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Casanova and Dr. Anabel Leek are preparing for bed.  Anabel sits in

front of a huge mirror, brushing her long hair as Casanova moves up

behind her and puts his hands around her throat, massaging, squeezing,

just barely resisting the temptation to strangle her.  (She loves it).

CUT RIGHT TO:

EXT.  THE LAWN - CONTINUOUS - ON OUR THREE HEROES

as they crunch their way non too stealthily across the backyard.

They all listen; there is a low rushing sound... It is the sound of

water rushing through pipes.  Suddenly, the lawn sprinklers all pop

up... and our heroes get drenched.  They duck off the lawn, behind the

cover of a large tree.

Furious sees a pair of French doors, off a small patio.  One of the

doors is slightiy open.

They start sneaking toward it, but as they cross the patio... they trip

the automatic security lighting, and suddenly find themselves bathed in

light.

As our heroes look around as a dozen Disco Boys, armed with pipes,

chains, brass knuckles, step into the light and encircle them... The

French doors open and Tony P steps out.

The Disco Boys attack.  The Raja is instantly clubbed down. The

Shoveler deflects only a blow or two with his shovel before he goes

down, too... These guys are not the Red Eyes.

Only Furious holds his own.  He grabs a pipe away from one of them and

swings fiercely, keeping the others off.  Suddenly, the Disco Boys pull

back.  Furious doesn't know why, until he turns and sees...

Casanova, standing right behind him, smiling.

With a cat-like move Casanova slashes his gold chain viciously--and

repeatedly--across Furious' face.  Furious, stunned with pain, lunges

at Casanova, who neatly steps aside, then catches him with a fast

combination of spinning disco kicks.  Finally he lassos the chain

around Furious' neck, and pulls it tight, strangling him.

ON THE DISCO BOYS, watching, snapping their fingers with admiration...

Casanova releases Furious, who slumps to the ground.  Casanova steps

away, and the Disco Boys gather around Furious and kick him

viciously... as Casanova and Tony P watch, amused, chuckling.

EXT.  JUST OUTSIDE THE MANSION - A MOMENT LATER

The Disco Boys drag our heroes through the gate and throw them like

bags of garbage into the street... where thay lie in a moaning,

agonized, semi-conscious heap.

INT.  THE DINER - LATER - CLOSE ON

Furious, rubbing his neck; a thin red mark runs around it. The three of

them are sitting at their usual table, in very bad shape, moaning and

groaning... Monica approaches.  She's made them ice packs and cold

compresses.

A FUSSY CUSTOMER is calling out from another table.

She moves off.

They take a long moment to ponder this.

Shoveler and Raja make disgusted noises.

EXT.  TACKY TACO - DAY - ESTABLISHING

A funky Mexican restaurant by the bus station.

INT.  THE RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

Our heroes, in normal clothing, have just finished a taco lunch.

Furious is writing a mssage on a napkin with a ballpoint pen.

CLOSE ON THE NOTE -

which reads "Spinks, we need you."

They crumple up the napkin and leave the restaurant... A moment later a

shy looking MEXICAN MAN busses their tray... but in A CLOSE ANGLE we

see him secretly pocket the napkin.

EXT. HOUSE - DAY - ESTABLISHING

A little brick house.

INT.  INVISIBLE BOY'S ROOM - DAY

A teenage boy's room, decorated to the max with models and posters of

the great superheroes: Batman, Spiderman, Captain Amazing, etc.

INVISIBLE BOY, about fifteen, is being interviewed by the Raja, Mister

Furious, and the Shoveler.

Our heroes are less than impressed.

ON OUR HEROES, looking around the room... and softening up.

INT.  THE DINER - NIGHT

Our heroes sit at their usual table along with Invisible Boy and a

weird looking guy in a greasy, stained yellow superhero outfit.  Across

his chest in falling off stick on letters it reads "THE SPLEEN", and

that's exactly who he is.  Furious, the Raja, and Shoveler sit as far

away from him as possible. He is a totally noxious, hyperactive

person... and he is thrilled to be there.

He puts the mustard dispenser to his lips and squeezes it straight into

his mouth.

Furious, Raja, and the Shoveler react; they can't believe they've

actually invited this guy to join their group.

He leans over the table and lets just a little tiny drop of spittle

dribble onto the table...

CLOSE ON THE TABLE -

as the spittle burns a hole in the Formica.

The Spleen inadvertently gives the tiniest little burp, and our three

heroes duck out of the way or under the table.

The people in the next booth give a cry of revulsion, put their hands

to their mouths, and immediately leave.

THE SAME - AFTER DINNER

Our heroes mull their situation over coffee.  Monica freshens their

cups.  The Spleen squirts mustard in his coffee.

They ignore that suggestion.

ON OUR HEROES, realizing that's it.

INT.  INVISIBLE BOY'S ROOM - NIGHT - WITH MUSIC

Invisible Boy sits at the desk in his room, writing immaculate little

notes on small file cards.  (He's made a whole pile of them.)

CLOSE ON THE NOTE -

which reads "Got superpowers?  Want to fight evil?  Then JOIN US and

let's PARTY HEARTY!  Beer!  Burgers!  Babes!"

SERIES OF SHOTS - MUSIC CONTINUES

as our heroes post these notes all over the city, in places where

lonely superheroes night find them...

The Raja posts a note on the door of a comic book store...

The Shoveler posts a note on the bulletin board at a bowling alley...

Mr. Furious tapes the note to the cracked glass of a vandalized phone

booth...

At an abandoned drive-in movie theater... Invisible Boy walks through

the empty lot, taping a note to each of the old speaker posts...

A White Castle hamburger joint... Inside the pay toilet Spleen is

scratching something on the wall with a nail. He stops and admires his

handiwork, and we see that he has engraved the entire message on the

wall...

END MUSIC.

EXT.  SHOVELER'S BACKYARD - DAY

A small, typical working class backyard.  A round, aluminum above

ground pool.  A Weber grill with burgers on it. Unopened packages of

hamburger rolls.  An old Vic Damon record plays on a boom box.  The

Spleen floats around on a rubber raft in the pool.

In fact, the water is turning a yellowish green... The rest of our

heroes sit around on cheap folding chairs.  No superheroes have shown

up.  The Shoveler, at the grill, serves burgers to his kids, who stand

in line waiting for them.

The kids scoff...  A moment later they head back to the house with

their burgers.

They go into the house.  No one says anything.  The Shoveler just

stares at the burgers on the grill.  Vic Damon sings. Furious chugs his

beer; he's working himself into a really morose mood.

ON THE SPLEEN, munching on a chlorine tablet.

Raja looks at his watch.

Suddenly, there is a knock at the gate.  Everyone immediately perks up.

A moment later they open the gate and see... HALF A DOZEN BURLY GUYS

wearing various superhero outfits.

At first glance these guys seem promising... but their outfits are

decidedly improvised: weird goggles and sunglasses, shower curtain

capes, baseball caps with beer cans on them.  Their leader holds a

squeegee with a long handle... Furious is suspicious.

The Invincible Dudes spot the keg.

They go immediately to the keg and start filling beer cups and guzzling

them down.  The Raja tries to hand out some forms.

ON FURIOUS, watching, starting to get pissed off.

Furious, fed up, confronts Squeegee Man.

The Invincible Dudes are cracking up.

EXT.  JUST OUTSIDE THE YARD - CONTINUOUS

as Squeegee Man comes flying--and screaming--over the fence, landing

none too gracefully in the front yard.

A beat and his squeegee come flying out after him.  Another beat and

the Invincible Dudes come running out the gate in a panic.

They take off down the street, running right past a woman, carrying a

bowling ball bag and dressed in a faded, threadbare old rayon superhero

costume with a decidedly fifties flavor. She is THE BOWLER.

EXT.  SHOVELER'S BACKYARD - A MOMENT LATER

Our heroes sit around the patio, dejected, miserable.

They look up, see her standing there, and aren't quite sure what to

make of her.

Our heroes share a look.

She takes her bowling ball and spins it on the tip of her finger (like

a Harlem Globetrotter).  For a long moment she just looks at them,

smiling.

ON THE OTHERS watching, almost mesmerized by the spinning ball...

Suddenly, she gives an ear splitting battle cry and starts swinging the

ball around her in wide ferocious arcs, like a cannibal with a war

club--or a twirler on meth, going so fast she almost becomes a blur...

Then, just as suddenly, she stops, aims and rolls her ball... It shoots

straight through Invisible Boy's legs...

ON A NEATLY PLACED COLLECTION OF PLASTER LAWN DWARVES -

as the ball smashes into then, pulverizing them... It goes into a

reverse spin, passes through Invisible Boy's legs again, and returns to

the Bowler who is holding its bag open for it... The ball rolls in.

ON OUR HEROES, left absolutely speechless.

She turns and walks out.  Our heroes share an amazed look, then run

after her...

JUST OUTSIDE THE GATE - ON THE BOWLER

walking away... as Furious catches up with her.

She takes his arm and they all start to walk back into the Shoveler's

backyard... but the CAMERA PANS ACROSS THE STREET to the dark place

between two houses, where a MAN WEARING A STRANGE STEEL MASK with a

frightening, impassively powerful expression stands in the deep

shadows, watching them in motionless, predatory silence.  We do not

know who he is, and we cannot tell if he is good or evil.

BACK AT THE BARBECUE - A LITTLE LATER - CLOSE ON

A FADED OLD SNAPSHOT of the original "The Bowler" holding a little girl

in his arms.

The others, touched by this, have gathered around the Bowler, who is

holding the old snapshot in her hand.

They all think about it for a moment.  You can almost smell their

brains overheating.

He gets beaned by a couple of empty soda cans.

MUSIC UP as Furious stands and starts out.  The others stand and follow

him... as our heroes form up for their first HEROIC GROUP SHOT.

EXT.  CITY STREET - NIGHT

MUSIC CONTINUES as A LITTLE OLD LADY crosses the street, when suddenly

she looks up and sees a pair of headlights coming on fast.  An

immaculately maintained seventies limo is heading straight for her.

INSIDE THE LIMO - CONTINUOUS

Disco Boys sit in the front.  Casanova, Anabel, and Tony P sit in the

back, dressed for a night on the town...

There is a thud as the limo hits the old lady, and everyone in the car

explodes into laughter.

INSIDE/OUTSIDE THE LIMO - A FEW MINUTES LATER

as the limo drives past a billboard with an ad for "MILK" with a milk

mustached Captain Amazing looking at the camera...

Tony P imitates a massive electrical convulsion, and the villains crack

up.

But as they pass the billboard, a pair of headlights illuminate in its

shadows, and the Shoveler's Ford Esquire pulls out and follows.

INSIDE THE ESQUIRE - CONTINUOUS

The Shoveler is driving.  Mister Furious sits in the front seat next to

him, and our other heroes are packed into the back.

INSIDE/OUTSIDE THE TWO CARS - CONTINUOUS

As the limo stops at a traffic light... and the Esquire pulls up

alongside it.  For a moment good and evil stare each other down.

The Disco Boys howl with laughter.

The D Boys laugh.  Furious stares at Casanova, and Casanova stares

right back at him, as cool as a snake.

The villains laugh, and Mister Furious EXPLODES INTO RAGE.  He swings

open his car door, mashing it into the limo and leaving a big dent.

He starts punching the limo like it's a punching bag--putting big dents

in it.

Tony and the boys all reach into their coats for their pistols--but as

they yank them out, the Spleen sticks his head out of the station

wagon, puts his face right up to the open window of the limo and lets

loose with a TREMENDOUS BELCH...

As the villains choke and gag in the noxious fumes, Mister Furious goes

on a DEMOLITION RAMPAGE, working his way around the limo, punching big

dents with his fists, breaking the windows with his head, flattening

the tires by kicking them, knocking off the rear view mirror with the

back of his hand...

Then he leaps up on top of the limo...

While inside the villains gasp for air as big dents are stomped into

the roof above them...

ANGLE THROUGH THE WINDSHEILD as Furious leaps down onto the hood, and

gazes in at them.

He plunges his hand through the metal of the hood, pulls out the car's

dip stick, and checks it.

He tosses the dip stick away, then leaps off JUST AS Tony P gets off a

shot, EXPLODING the windshield of the limo.

Furious lands safely on the hood of the station wagon.  As the Shoveler

throws the Esquire into gear, Furious shouts...

And our heroes streak off into the night... Casanova and the others

stagger out of the demolished limo, sucking in the clean air.

ANGLE ON A DARKENED ALLEY -

where the man in the strange steel mask can be seen... watching.

EXT.  A BAR - LATER THAT NIGHT - ESTABLISHING

A very typical, nondescript neighborhood place...

INSIDE THE BAR - CONTINUOUS

Our heroes stand at the bar, celebrating their first victory.

They toast and drink.

THE SAME - LATER

The Spleen is passed out at a table, snoring. Shoveler and Invisible

Boy sit next to him.

Raja and Bowler sit at the bar, deep in it.

ON SHOVELER AND INVISIBLE BOY

BACK ON RAJA AND BOWLER -

They clink their glasses and drink.

BACK ON SHOVELER AND INVISIBLE BOY -

The Spleen makes weird noises in his sleep.

Mr. Furious sits alone in the corner, brooding, lost in his own angry

thoughts..

OUTSIDE THE BAR - CONTINUOUS

A black van drives slowly past the bar.

INSIDE THE VAN - CONTINUOUS

The van is packed with Disco Boys.  Tony P sits in the front seat.

HIS POV -

He has spotted the Ford Esquire parked in the lot.

BACK IN THE BAR - A LITTLE LATER

ON THE BOWLER AND RAJA -

JUST OUTSIDE - A MONENT LATER

As our heroes, carrying the Spleen, leave.

But suddenly the world is a whirling sass of chains and clubs as they

are bushwhacked by the Disco Boys...

EXT.  AN ALLEY - A LITTLE LATER - CLOSE ON FURIOUS

as he comes to with a qroan and sees... the Bowler and Invisible Boy

tied up and gagged, with the Raja, Shoveler, and the Spleen trussed up

right next to them.  Furious looks up, sees Tony P standing over him.

Furious struggles, but he has been secured with some very heavy tire

chains.  Tony P takes out a large caliber revolver, flips it open to

make sure it's loaded.

He turns and points the pistol right at Invisible Boy's head. Furious

struggles against his chains--to no avail.

Invisible Boy closes his eyes... Tony P cocks the pistol... But

suddenly, there is the ring of steel--a broad blade sweeps through the

air, and Tony P's pistol is sliced neatly in half.

The man is the strange steel mask is standing there, the drawn machete

still in his hand.

The Disco Boys rush the newcomer, but he slices through their baseball

bats with his machete, and sends them reeling and crashing into each

other with expert forearm blows, whacks with the flat of his blade, and

head butts with his mask.

Furious struggles to break free and join the fight, but the chains are

too strong... and the stranger doesn't need any help.

Tony P flicks open a big switchblade and lunges at the stranger, who

sidesteps him like a matador and swings his machete at him.  Tony P

turns, about to charge again.

Tony P feels the top of his head, and realizes that the blow from the

machete has neatly sliced off the top his disco-do, leaving only

stubble on the top of his head.

Tony and the Disco Boys run for it...

Furious and the others study their masked savior, who stands before

them, machete in hand.

He raises his machete above Furious' head... and then slices clean

through the chains.

EXT.	AUTO DEMOLITION YARD - LATER THAT NIGHT

Our heroes have gathered around a scrap wood fire in a steel drum. They

sit on the ground and on old car seats, feeling like schmucks as the

Sphinx chews theu out, his mask looking very friqhtening and magical in

the flickering light.

Furious sulks, but the others get the point.

Furious grunts.

They are silent.

Furious sulks again, feeling that the others are turning against him.

A silence.

EXT.  DOC HELLER'S FARMHOUSE - DAY

Our heroes stand looking at an old farubouse.  The place is an absolute

wreck.  It hasn't been painted in twenty-five years. Windows are

boarded up.  Half the shingles are gone.  There's visible fire damage

around the kitchen window.

She is about to knock, but the door is suddenly yanked open, and an

eighty year old guy is standing there.  He's got a wild head of white

hair (that looks like a living explosion), and he wears a stained old

lab coat with stickum mtssages to himself stuck to it, non-matching

slippers, and a pair of thick glasses with frames that have been

composited of half a dozen different old pairs all taped and welded

together into a fantastic concoction.  He is DOC HELLER.

Furious throws a look at the Shoveler and Raja.  This guy's out of it.

They're wasting their time.

EXT.  BEHIND THE HOUSE - A MINUTE LATER - MOVING ANGLE

as Doctor Heller leads them all briskly across his overgrown yard

toward... the barn.

INT.  THE BARN - CONTINUOUS

As our heroes step into Heller's laboratory/arsenal.  A stack of small

aluminum cans lines one wall.  There are weird lookinq sprayers, tubes,

and strange homemade toy-like devices... but there isn't a firearm in

sight.

Furious groans, and the others share a look.  This guy's really a nut.

Furious turns and goes out, and the others start to follow. But the

Bowler picks up a canned tornado.

OUTSIDE THE BARN - CONTINUOUS

as Furious walks away, the Bowler steps out of the barn.

Furious stops, turns back.

She tosses the can to him.  He catches it--just as a small angry

tornado FUNNELS out of the can.  It catches Furious and lifts him high

in the air... then dissipates to nothing...

A beat later Furious lands on the ground with a painful thump.

ON THE OTHERS, amazed.

Furious gets to his feet, unhurt, but really pissed off.  He starts

back toward the barn, violently kicking the empty can. The others get

out of his way, as, muttering angrily to himself, he goes back into the

barn...

And emerges a moment later, toting the air cannon.

The others think he's going to use it on them and scatter for cover.

but Furious steps out into the yard, looking for a suitable target...

He sees an old abandoned outhouse, puts the air cannon to his shoulder,

aims, and fires...

There is a loud WHOOOOMPH of compressed air, and the huge recoil of the

cannon instantly flings Furious back against the wall of the barn.  But

the big rush of air hits the shed dead center... and BLOWS IT TO

PIECES, leaving only the old seat.

Furious gets up, dusts himself off, and moves to Doc Heller.

The others ignore Furious and listen to the Sphinx.

The others nod in agreemnt... while Furious fumes.

MONTAGE WITH MUSIC - TRAINING AT THE FARM

CLOSE ON DOC HELLER aiming his air cannon... CAMERA PULLS BACK TO

REVEAL our heroes (minus Furious) standing in a pack right behind him,

holding him down. HE fires, and the recoil jolts them all violently,

but it doesn't knock them over...

as half a dozen scarecrows are blown to pieces... Our heroes chieer and

shake their fists... while Mr. Furious sits alone on the sidelines,

drinking bourbon, and feeling very alienated.

VARIOUS SHOTS as our heroes learn to fight as a team... crawling across

the grass together....charginq in a line... hurling canned tornadoes...

while Furious sits it out, brooding, drinking, and getting very jealous

of the Sphinx.

Shoveler, Bowler, and the Sphinx stand shoulder to shoulder, as

Invisible Boy, Spleen, Raja, and the Doc throw small stones at them...

They deflect the pebbles with shovel, bowling ball, and machete...

Theyre having fun.  They're becoming a team...

EXT.  OUTSIDE THE BARN - EVENING

Furious drinks alone, while the rest of our heroes sit around an old

picnic table, feasting on sodas and pizza (like a football team after a

great practice.)  Raja explains the history of the situation to the

Sphinx.

Furious and the Sphinx square off, their faces only inches apart.

ON THE RAJA, hurt.

ON THE OTHERS, watching him...

EXT.  COUNTRY ROAD - CONTINUOUS - CLOSE ON FURIOUS

the wind whipping against his face, as he rides his Harley at about a

hundred miles an hour... The languorous sound of an OLD DEAN MARTIN

SONG is heard as we...

FADE INTO:

MENORY SEQUENCE - DAY - CLOSE ON FURIOUS

as a little boy, sitting in the backseat of the family car. It is

thirty years ago, and Mister Furious is a sweet, very shy, well

behaved, perfectly normal three year old.  His MOTHER and FATHER sit in

the front.  Dean Martin is playing on the car radio.  Little Furious

looks out the window and sees the Mohave Desert going by.  A sign reads

"Las Vegas, 120 miles".

An old sign reads "BAR" as the family car pulls into the parking lot of

a single adobe building out in the middle of nowhere.  They park.

They get out, lock the car and head for the bar, leaving the windows

up.  Little Furious watches them go, never suspecting that his entire

life is about to change.  He sits quietly in the backseat and plays

with the little superhero figurines that he's brought with him.

INSIDE THE BAR - CONTINUOUS

as the parents enter.  A very Western motif.  An old Gene Autrey song

is playing on the juke.  The air conditioning is on.	They're the only

customers in the place.

CUT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN CAR AND BAR -

ANGLE ON THE MIDDAY SON - blazing down on the car...

as Little Furious still plays with his superheroes, but the interior is

starting to bake, and the sweat begins to pour ofr him.  He looks out

at the bar. gettinq worried.  He tries the windows, but they're

automatic and won't open...

Back in the bar his parents down shots of bourbon with their beers, as

the BARTENDER finishes telling them a joke.

Mom and Dad have a good laugh.

ANGLE FROM OUTSIDE TUE CAR as Little Furious, sweat and tears pouring

out of him, his hair wet and sticking out (and starting to take on that

familiar look), pounds on the window.

as back in the bar his parents, now very drunk, down more beers and

chasers as they play a spirited game of pinball.

ANGLE ON THE MOHAVE SUN - beating down mercilessly

barely able to breath, Little Furious flops back onto the seat, his

face a mask of heat and terror... But suddenly, a change begins to take

place in him, as some primordial defense mechanism kicks in... and his

fear begins to give way to rage... His teeth bare.

CLOSE ON HIS HANDS -

as they CRUSH the superhero figurines in their grasp...

While back in the bar his drunken parents dance a slow two step to Hank

Williams "Your Cheatin' Heart"...

EXT.  TBE PARKING LOT - NIGHT - HANK WILLIAMS CONTINUES

as the big desert moon shines down on the family car, still parked

there.

INSIDE THE BAR - CONTINUOUS

The parents are asleep in a booth.  Furious' mother wakes up, looks

around groggily, and in a moment of horror suddenly remembers...

THE PARKING LOT - A BEAT LATER

as she runs toward the car, hysterical.

She unlocks the door, throws it open, and sees something that makes her

pull back in horror... Little Furious sits in the backseat.  His hair

sticks out wildly, his face has become that now familiar mask of

prisordial rage.  Another OLD DEAN MARTIN SONG is heard as we...

FADE INTO:

INT.  THE DINER - NIGHT - CLOSE ON FURIOUS

sitting alone in the booth, a look of profound pain and lonliness on

his face; he is still that little boy.  The Dean Martin song is playing

on the juke.

He looks up and sees Monica.

She smiles.

EXT.  THE FRANKENSTEIN MANSION - CONTINUOUS

Armed Disco Boys guard the front entrance...

While on the hillside above Invisible Boy (looking through binoculars)

and the Spleen lie together on their bellies in the weeds, keeping the

mansion under surveillance.

Suddenly, the gates of the mansion open and several sedans... followed

by a truck, drive out...

POV THROUGH BINOCULARS -

Casanova and Anabel sit in the front of the truck.

Invisible Boy hesitates for just a momnt, then gets up and runs down

the hill.

As the small convoy drives past, Invisible Boy slips out from behind

some trees, runs after the truck, jumps up and sits on its rear bumper.

The Spleen comes running after him, and Invisible Boy reaches out,

grabs his hand and pulls him up alongside him.  Invisible Boy tries the

rear gate.  It's open. The two of them pull it up just a foot, squirm

inside, then pull it closed behind them.

INSIDE THE TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

Invisible Boy flashes the light of his key chain flashlight around the

inside of the truck.  There is nothing in it, except for a large pile

of packing blankets.

EXT.  WATERFRONT AREA - NIGHT

as the convoy drives through Champion City's seedy waterfront area and

out onto a long pier.

INT.  THE DINER - NIGHT - CLOSE ON THE TV

Dawn Wong and Don Stouffer report the night's news.

Mr. Furious sits in the booth drinking coffee as Monica serves him his

burger and fries.

ON FURIOUS, feeling a whole lot better.

JUST OUTSIDE THE DINER - CONTINUOUS - UNKNOWN POV

from across the street.  Furious' head is clearly visible in the

brightly illuminated window of the diner.

A Disco Boy stands in the shadows, gazing at the diner; he recognizes

Furious.

EXT.  WATERFRONT - NIGHT

The convoy has pulled up alongside a rusty old freighter, docked at the

pier.

Casanova's men throw the gate of the truck open, and the CAMERA MOVES

IN.  No one is there, but we notice... two large lumps under the

packing blankets.

Casanova holds Anabel in his arms as they watch a large wooden crate

being lowered from the deck of the freighter.

Casanova's cellular phone rings.

OUTSIDE THE DINER - CONTINUOUS

The Disco Boy is on his phone.  His pistol is drawn, and he's got it

aimed right at Furious' head.

BACK TO THE PIER - CONTINUOUS - ON CASANOVA

A minute later Casanova and two or three Disco Boys drive off in one of

the sedans... as the crate is loaded onto the truck, and the gate is

pulled closed... and locked.

INSIDE THE TRUCK - A MOMENT LATER

The engine starts up, and the truck starts to move, as Invisible Soy

and the Spleen poke their heads out from under the packing blankets...

They approach the crate and Invisible Boy shines his flashlight on it.

The crate is secured with rivets and thick metal bands; there's no way

they're going to be able to get inside it, but in the light of the

flashlight they see...

Faded red lettering, in Russian, and the distinctive old hammer and

sickle of the former Soviet Union.

EXT.  DIMLY LIT STREET - NIGHT

Furious walks Monica home.

In the shadows behind them... Casanova follows, stalking them, as

silent as a vampire.

He nods.

CASANOVA'S POV

Monica, smiling, looking lovely.

CLOSE 0N CASANOVA; he wants her...

BACK ON FURIOUS AND MONICA -

He shrugs.  And they kiss, very tenderly.

She turns and climbs the stairs of an old apartmnt building and goes

inside, as Furious watches, feeling emotions hees not used to. He

really likes her.  He starts walking back down the street, past a man

sitting on the stoop.  The man looks up.  It's Casanova Frankenstein.

Furious is caught completely by surprise--he takes a stand, ready to

fight.

Furious, silent.

Furious reacts to the fact that Casanova knows his real name.

CLOSE ON FURIOUS as, out of the corner of his eye, he catches movement

in the alley across the street... he knows what it is.

Gunfire rings out from the alley as the Disco Bays step out, their

pistols blazing.  But Furious has anticipated them.  He leaps right at

Casanova, pins his arms in a bear hug and holds him in the line of

fire.

The Disco BQys stop firing... Furious drags Casanova back into an empty

lot, using him as a shield.

Furious releases Casanova, then runs for it and leaps over the wooden

wall at the end of the lot... as the Disco Boys open fire again, and

their bullets punch holes through the wall...

Furious runs down a back street and escapes into the night.

EXT.  THE FRANKENSTEIN CENTER - CONTINUOUS

The convoy drives up the hill toward an ominous looking structure (that

we recognize from the model on the TV interview with Casanova earlier.)

A high central tower rises up out of the half completed bulwarks of

featureless concrete. It looks both totally modern and completely

ancient, but a profound sense of evil connects both themes beautifully.

ANGLE ON a plaque that reads...  "Frankenstein Center for the

Performing and Non-performing Arts".

The gates of the center open, and the convoy passes through.

INSIDE THE TRUCK - A NONENT LATER

Invisible Boy and the Spleen stand listening, waiting, as they feel the

truck pull to a stop...

A moment later the gate is pulled opened... Anabel is there with

several thuggy looking SECURITY GUARDS.

There are two lumps under the packing blankets again.

EXT.  LOADING DOCK - A FEW MINUTES LATER

The crate is being carried away by a forklift... A beat, and then

Invisible Boy and the Spleen slip out of the empty truck...

And run down the road back toward the gates... which are still open.

They're just about to pass safely through them, when a PAIR OF ARMED

SECURITY GUARDS, step in their path, their guns pointed at thern.

They freeze, their hands held high.

Our heroes are mute.

Invisible Boy and the Spleen turn, hands in the air, and start up the

hill, the guards right behind them.

Invisible Boy pinches his nostrils--and the Spleen lets out with a

horrendous fart.  The guards gag and choke violently in the fumes as

our heroes turn and run for it... escaping out the gates.

INT.  DOC KELLER'S LABORATORY/BARN - A LITTLE LATER

Invisible Boy and Spleen report to the others.

The others consider this, then hear a familiar voice.

They look up and see that Furious has just returned... The Sphinx moves

to him.  For a moment they stand face to face...

Sphinx takes off his mask, revealing that he is the busboy from the

Tacky Taco.

They embrace.

A few mimutes later.  The others are gathered around Furious, listening

to his story.

Through the window the moon is seen rising over the hillside, the

Frankenstein Center silhouetted ominously against it. Raja, Shoveler,

and Furious gaze at it.

MONTAGE WITH MUSIC - THE NEXT DAY

CLASSIC DISCO ("Stayin' Alive" if we can get the rights)

Furious, Raja, and Shoveler (in street clothes) walk down the street

together and step into the doorway of... the Salvation Army Thrift

Shop...

Later.  CLOSE ON three pairs of legs, wearing polyester pants and

vintage shoes (ala the classic shot from "Saturday Night Fever")...

CAMERA WIDENS TO REVEAL our three heroes, dressed in full blown

seventies attire (with vintage sunglasses), doing their best Travolta

strut down the street...

MUSIC CONTINUES as our heroes strut their way through the gates of the

art center, right past the security guards...

OUTSIDE THE CENTER - DAY

They climb the long stairs toward the center, which looms above them...

then pass through the big wooden doors and into...

INT.  MAIN HALL - A MOMENT LATER

END MUSIC as our heroes move through a vast, but empty main hall... A

small army of heavily armed security guards marches about.

They hear a WILD BURST OF DRUNKEN LAUGHTER echoing through the hall.

They approach a doorway.  The noise is coming from within.

INT.  BANQUET IIALL - A MOMENT LATER

as our heroes step inside and see... A big luncheon is in progress.

Casanova, Anabel, and Tony P sit at the head table. The room is lined

with banquet tables, which are filled with VICIOUS LOOKING CHARACTERS,

drunk, eating, laughing, and giving the waitresses a very rough tim..

ON A GROUP OF VICIOUS LOOKING BALD BIKER TYPES...

ON THREE INSIPIDLY EVIL LOOKING GUYS in hip suits...

ON A DARK HAIRED WHITE GUY dressed as a rapper...

ON A GUY with a frightening assortment of metal things piercing his

face...

ON TWO THUGS DRESSED AS ELVIS...

A more degenerate group of criminals never sat down to lunch. Furious

recognizes one of the waitresses...   It's Monica.

Casanova's got his eye on her, too, and he remembers her from the night

before on the street with Furious.

ON ANABEL, noticing his interest.

Our heroes see Monica walking straight toward them. They turn away,

lean against a wail, trying to be totally inconspicuous...

But as she passes them, not noticing them... Casanova approaches her.

She stops, turns to him, while our heroes listen in, only a few feet

away...

CLOSE ON FURIOUS, getting jealous.

Furious growls.  Raja gives him an elbow.

Mister Furious is fuming.  The strands of his perfectly coiffed disco-

do start to stand straight up.

She turns and walks into the kitchen.

CLOSE ON CASANOVA, watching her; his intentions are sinister...  He

turns and sees... our heroes, hanging by the wall.

Our heroes skulk out.

JUST OUTSIDE THE BANQUET HALL - CONTINUOUS

as our heroes step out and breathe a sigh of relief.

Furious has spotted... a large covered dessert table, waiting to be

wheeled into the hall.

BACK IN THE BANQUET HALL - A FEW MINUTES LATER

as the dessert table is wheeled in... and in a CLOSER ANGLE, under the

table cloth, we see three pairs of disco shoes creeping along...

A few minutes later, Monica steps up to the dessert table... Suddenly,

she is yanked under.

UNDER THE TABLE - CONTINUOUS

Monica struggles, tries to cry out, but a hand is clamped firmly over

her mouth.

She calms down, and he takes his hand off her mouth.

The waitresses leave; the big doors to the dining room are swung

closed, and the cigars are lit.  The meeting has begun. Casanova takes

the podium.

Tony P chuckles loudly, but the joke goes over like a lead balloon with

the rest of the crowd.

ON THE HOODS, listening, bored, puffing on their cigars; this is a sad

old story.

ON OUR HEROES under the table, listening.  Monica begins to realize

what's going on.

BACK TO CASANOVA -

The guests think Casanova's completely lost it.  Italian Ice speaks up.

Now the hoods' interest has been perked.

Anabel puts on a pair of heavy duty sound deadening ear protectors,

then presses a button on a small remote control device.

ANGLE ON A SPEAKER, placed above the podium... as the air is suddenly

filled with a weird, stridulating, HORRIFIC NOISE (somewhere between

the sound of a fire siren and a hornet trapped in your ear) and

everyone in the room (except Anabel) goes COMPLETELY BERSERK...

CAMERA PANS the tables as the guests laugh dementedly, punching,

gouging, strangling, and stabbing each other...

Under the serving table our heroes go crazy...

Casanova, in a state of psychotic ecstasy, whips out his pistol and

empties it into Italian Ice... who drops to the floor, dead.

Anabel presses the button again; the sound winds down and stops, and

everything returns to normal.  The entire event lasted only a few

seconds, but the guests are dazzled.

Casanova throws Anabel a kiss.

Suddenly, a familiar voice is heard.

A pair of curtains suddenly part... and Captain Amazing (looking a bit

singed) is standing there in classic superhero pose.

CAMERA PANS the crooks, as their criminal ecstasy turns instantly to

terror.  They yank out their pistols, dive for cover under the table,

throw up their hands in surrender, etc... But Casanova just grins.

Casaova reaches behind Captain Amazing's back and pulls a string (like

the ones they used to have on those old talking dolls).

The crooks are beside themselves with laughter.

ON OUR HEROES, under the table, stunned.

ON THE ELVIS BROTHERS -

The crooks fire their pistols exuberantly into the air, as disco music

fills the air and Casanova dances, basking in their adoration...

And our heroes slip out from under the table and make good their

escape...

INT.  DOC HELLER'S BARN/LAB - LATER

Our heroes and Monica pow-wow, sobered by what they have seen.

They react to that piece of news, and then the Bowler opens up the

newspaper.

CLOSE ON A PHOTO of Anabel and Casanova, announcing their wedding

engagement.

Silence; this is bad.

Another grim silence, as they realize how desperate the situation is.

For the first time, they're really scared.

CAMERA CUTS BETWEEN THEM as they look at each other--their frightened

faces, their sad, faded costuznes.  Even the Sphinx looks scared.

They look at him.

ON THE SPLEEN...

They're all with him.  Monica steps forward.

A few minutes later, Monica serves sandwiches and coffee as our heroes

plan...

ON MONICA as she gets an idea.  A moment later she slips a canned

tornado into her purse... as the others put their arms around each

other in a group huddle\embrace.

HEROIC MUSIC as...

EXT.  AUTO DEMOLITION YARD - DAY - CLOSE ANGLE ON

THE FRONT GRILL of the Herkimer Battle Jitney... as Mister Furious

hooks it up to the "Sally's Auto Demolition" tow truck... A moment

later he drives the tow truck, towing the off the lot, as Sally steps

out of her office, pissed off...

EXT.  HELLER'S FARM - DAY

ON THE SPHINX, standing as immobile and silent as a statue... as a

falling leaf slowly flutters down in front of him... In a flash, his

machete slices through the air, and the leaf continues fluttering down,

but in two pieces...

INT.  LABORATORY/BARN - DAY

Doc Heller fine tunes his Shrinker spray... as the Bowler sits quietly

in the hayloft, studying the old dog eared photo of her father and

herself as a little girl...

INT.  INVISIBLE BOY'S ROOM - DAY

Invisible Boy stands in front of his mirror, eyes closed, concentrating

for all he's worth, trying to become invisible...  He suddenly pops

opens his eyes and looks at himuself in the mirror... but he's still

completely visible. He flops onto his bed in frustration.

INT.  THE DINER - DAY

CLOSE ON A TABLE full of food... Eggplant Parmesan, broccoli, chili...

CAKERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL the Spleen sitting alone in the booth,

stuffing his face, gassing up for battle.

INT.  THE SHOVELER'S HOUSE - DAY

The Shoveler, standing in his bedroom, has just put on his freshly

laundered suit.  CAMERA OPENS WIDE TO REVEAL Lucille, his wife,

standing there, holding his just polished shovel. He takes it from her,

then takes her in his arms.

And they kiss.

A few minutes later... In the living room the Shoveler's kids lie

sprawled in front of the television.  The Shoveler, in battle array,

steps into the room.  Be wants to say something to them, but the kids

don't even take their eyes off the TV look at him... He turns and walks

out in silence.

END MUSIC...

INT.  THE RAJA'S DINING ROOM - DAY

The shades are drawn.  The Raja, in full costume, quietly loads

silverware into the secret pockets of his cape. Suddenly, the light

switches on... It's his mother.  She's caught him red handed.

ON HIS MOTHER, shocked.

INT.  UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER

She pulls down the stairway to the attic...

INT.  THE ATTIC - A MOMENT LATER

She switches on the light and leads the Raja to a far corner...  where

she moves a couple of old hat boxes, REVEALING an ancient leather bound

box with the word "Excalibur" engraved in gold on the top.

The Raja opens the box and registers astonisha~nt as he sees...

A FABULOUS VICTORIAN SILVER SET packed with formidable looking servers,

cake knives, ice cream forks.

The Raja lifts up and handles a large heavily engraved pie server.

EXT.  OUTSIDE HELLER'S BARN/LAB - EVENING - CLOSE ON

Mister Furious, wrench in hand, covered with grease and oil, cussing to

himself as he works under the hood of the Herkimer.

Invisible Boy, sitting behind the wheel, tries the ignition of the

Herkimer, and the old engine grinds as it turns over, but doesn't

catch.

Mister Furious SLUGS the engine with his fist, and it sputters and

backfires into life... shaking, rattling, leaking, exploding, but

running... Furious kisses the Herkimer... as the Bowler calls out to

him from the barn.

EXT.  UNKNOWN LOCATION - EVENING - CLOSE ON MONICA

BACK TO FURIOUS - CONTINUOUS

BACK TO MONICA - WIDER ANGLE

REVEALING that she is on a pay phone just outside the art center.

She's wearing make-up and a sexy little dress; she looks she's dressed

for a date.  Disco Boys and security guards go about their business all

around her.

CUT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THEM -

Furious silent, taken aback by her courage.

INT.  LOBBY OF THE FRANKENSTEIN CENTER - CONTINUOUS

as Monica approaches a GUARD standing by the main door.

BACK TO THE BARN - CONTINUOUS

Furious stands by the Herkimer, phone still in hand.  He seems

speechless, dazed.  Something inside him has changed.

BACK TO THE FRANKENSTEIN CENTER - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Casanova steps out and sees... Monica, looking very sexy.

His eyes roam all over her; he knows she's up to something, but she

looks yummy, and this is just the sort of cat and mouse game he loves.

EXT.  COURTYARD - A FEW MINUTES LATER

as Casanova leads Monica across an open courtyard toward... the sheer

walls of the imposing central tower.

He leads her to a massive archway, the only apparent entrance to the

tower.  But just as she is about to pass through, Monica looks up and

sees something that makes her pull back with fear...

HER POV -

A very sinister looking SECURITY EYE gazes down at her from the top of

the archway.

They pass through and into...

INT.  ROOM IN THE BASE OF TOWER - CONTINUOUS

which is filled with IMMENSE BRONZE SCULPTURES of voluptuous, scantily

clad females in various poses of bondage.  Monica reacts; these things

are scary.

EXT.  THE BARN/LAB - NIGHT

The Bowler, Spleen, Invisible Boy, and Doc Heller load up the Herkimer

with Heller's weaponry...

as Mister Furious lies sprawled on the hillside... breathing in the

night air, contemplating a dandelion gone to seed, and listening to the

sounds of the night.  The Raja, Shoveler, and Sphinx, stand nearby,

watching, trying to figure out what's wrong with him.  A whippoorwill

is heard singing.

Raja and Shoveler share a bewildered look.  The bird sings again.

INT.  TOP OF THE FRANKENSTEIN TOWER - CONTINUOUS

Casanova leads Monica into... a palatial room, filled with priceless

objects d'art, all of which reflect Casanova's dark psyche.  A Munch

painting.  Mayan idols.  Weird German furniture.  A huge glass

chandelier hovers over the room.  A massive bronze sculpture of a wolf

(done in the same style as the other sculptures) is perched in the

balcony.  It seems to be howling out over the city which is seen in a

spectacular view, spread out alonq the lakeshore below.

He turns down the lights and quietly closes and locks the big door to

the room.

CLOSE ON MONICA, sensing her danger.

She moves out onto the balcony... as Casanova slips the gold chain from

around his neck and follows her.

INT.  BARN/LAB - CONTINUOUS

Our heroes have gathered around Furious, who sits in a chair, getting

the third degree.

The Shoveler slugs him, sending him sprawling.

EXT.  BALCONY ON FRANKENSTEIN TOWER - ON MONICA

gazing out onto the city, as she senses Casanova slinking up behind

her.

She turns, elegantly avoiding him, and moving back inside.

BACK TO THE BARN/LAB - CONTINUOUS

Spleen holds up Furious' favorite sunglasses.

The others groan with frustration.

BACK AT THE FRANKENSTEIN TOWER - CONTINUOUS

Monica moves nervously around the room as Casanova sprawls languorously

on the bed, toying with his gold chain.

Suddenly, he hears high heels in the hall.  A key is put in the lock--

Casanova leaps off the bed, grabs Monica and roughly shoves her into

the closet.  He leaps back onto the bed, just as the door opens, and

Anabel, dressed in a lab coat (and wearing high heels) enters.

Casanova is completely relaxed, nonchalant.

She crosses the room to the wolf sculpture.

She opens a secret panel on its back, REVEALNG a FLASHING HIGH TECH

INTERIOR... and Monica, watching from the closet, realizes that she has

found the Psychostridulator.

BACK TO THE BARN/LAB - CONTINUOUS - CLOSE ON

a boom box... A CD jacket tells us that "Kenny G." is playing...

ON FURIOUS, a pair of headphones on his head.  The music is so loud

that we can hear it even though it's being played only through the

headphones.

ON THE OTHERS, gathered around him, waiting to see if this will work.

And then Furious begins to respond... as his face turns into a

contorted grimace.

Furious groans and writhes... The others are thrilled; they've done it!

He starts to weep.  The others give a collective groan of defeat.

BACK AT THE FRANKENSTEIN TOWER - COHTINUOUS

as Anabel works on the Psychostridulator, Monica looks at a clock...

which reads almost eleven.  Time is running out.

BACK TO THE BARN/LAB - CLOSE ON SHOVELER'S WRISTWATCH

which also reads eleven.

0N SHOVELER AND RAJA -

BACK TO THE FRANKENSTEIN TOWER -

as Anabel closes up the wolf... and starts to leave.

She goes out.  Casanova listens as the sound of high heels fades away,

then he goes to the closet and lets Monica out.

She makes a sudden try for the door, but he blocks her way, a cold look

in his eye that makes her step back in fear.

He lets the gold chain drop loose in his hand, then starts coming for

her, a sadistic grin on his face.  This is the real Casanova.

Monica pulls back, then reaches into her purse and takes out A CANNED

TORNADO, which she holds out threateningly.

He laughs dementedly as Monica pops open the can and A SWIRLING FUNNEL

OF AIR SHOOTS OUT OF IT and ENGULFS Casanova, throwing him across the

room... Monica grabs the handset of a cordless phone and runs out the

door.

ON CASANOVA, pulling himself together.

INT.  CORRIDOR JUST OUTSIDE - CONTINUOUS

as Monica runs for it, dialing the phone on the fly...

INT.  TEE BARN/LAB - CONTINUOUS - ON THE PUONE

ringing... but no one is there...

EXT.  THE BARN/LAB - CONTINUOUS

Our heroes are climbing into the Herkimar, whose noisy idling engine

obliterates the ringing of the phone.

He shoves him in the back, closing the heavy steel door behind him.

BACK TO THE FRANKENSTEIN TOWER - CONTINUOUS - ON MONICA

hiding behind a large planter... listening to the phone ringing on the

other end.

Suddenly, we hear Casanova's voice on the line.

BACK IN THE TOWER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Casanova is listening in on another phone.

BACK TO M0NICA - CONTINUOUS

as she moves quickly down the hall.

INSIDE THE HERKIMER - CONTINUOUS

The Shoveler is at the wheel.  The Raja sits in the passenger seat.

The others are in the back.

He forces the stick into gear and the Herkimer lurches forward.

EXT.  DOC HELLER'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

as the Herkimer--backfiring, smoking, clanging--rumbles down the

driveway into action.

BACK IN THE HERKINER - CONTINUOUS

Shoveler tries to put the car in second gear, but it won't go. He yanks

and pulls and struggles, until the stick comes off in his hand.

INT.  CORRIDOR IN FRANKENSTEIN TOWER - CONTINUOUS

Casanova instructs three security guards.

CAMERA PANS UP the top of a staircase... where Monica is crouched,

listening.

EXT.  STREETS OF CHAMPION CITY - NIGHT

VARIOUS SHOTS as the Herkimer rumbles and smokes down Champion's main

street (in first gear) and the citizens step out of houses and bars to

watch this bizarre sight.

ON A LITTLE BOY AND HIS FATHER -

A couple of GRIZZLED CHARACTERS stand in front of a bar.

INSIDE THE HERKIMER - CONTINUOUS

ON FURIOUS AND THE OTHERS in the back.

Furious closes his eyes and tries, but it's hopeless.

INT.  V.I.P. LOUNGE IN FRANKENSTEIN TOWER - CONTINUOUS

A sumptuous, hotel-like lounge.  Anabel is holding court with all of

top crooks from the luncheon, charrning the pants off them... Casanova

slithers up behind her.

EXT.  FRONT GATE OF THE FRANKENSTEIN CENTER - CONTINUOUS

A pair of security guards (the same two who got gassed by the Spleen)

are on duty, when they see... a strange looking vehicle chugging up the

hill straight for them.

They have a good laugh at it, then hold up their hands for it to

stop...  But the Herkimer just rolls past them, hitting the iron gates

and snapping them open as if they were made of match sticks.

They open fire.

INSIDE THE HERKIMER - CONTINUOUS

Bullets are heard pinging off the Herk as THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD just

ahead we see the long stairway heading up to the front door of the art

center.

EXT.  ON THE STAIRS - CONTINUOUS

Several more guards open fire, as the Herkimer hits the stairs and

starts bouncing up them...

BACK AT THE LOUNGE - ON CASANOVA

checking his watch.

But then they all hear... the sound of gunfire.

BACK ON THE STAIRS - CONTINUOUS

as the Herkimer chugs and bounces... toward the entrance of the center.

INSIDE THE HERKIMER - CONTINUOUS

Our heroes get bounced all over the place.

INT.  JUST INSIDE THE CENTER - CONTINUOUS

as guards close and bolt the big wooden doors to the art center.

ON A GUARD wearing a headset.

INT.  SECURITY DESK - CONTINUOUS

Casanova sits at a security console.  Anabel, Tony P, and the top

crooks stand behind him, listening.

BACK ON THE STAIRS - CONTINUOUS

as the Herkimer climbs to the top, then rams into the doors with a

thud.  But the doors hold.

BACK ON THE VILLAINS -

BACK AT THE FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS

But the plucky little Herkimer digs in its rear wheels and pushes

against the doors like the Little Engine That Could...

INSIDE THE HERKIMER - CONTINUOUS

as our heroes encourage the Herk.

ON ITS WHEELS, grinding, chewing up the concrete...

JUST INSIDE THE CENTER - CONTINUOUS

as the Herkimer comes crunching through the big wooden doors of the

center, scattering the guards.

BACK INSIDE THE HERKIMER - CONTINUOUS

our heroes cheer, pat the Herk.

BACK TO CASANOVA -

watching on a security monitor

BACK IN THE HALL - CONTINUOUS

The Herkimer drives into the main hall of the center as a small army of

security guards swarms in, guns blazing.

BACK AT THE SECURITY DESK - CONTINUOUS

Casanova and the crooks watch the security monitor...

INSIDE THE HERKIMER - CONTINUOUS

The bullets sound like hailstones bouncing off the armor of the Herk as

our heroes grimly prepare themselves for battle...The Sphinxs puts on

his mask... the Bowler unzips her bag...Doc Heller cocks his air

cannon... Spleen and Invisible Boy load a bag with canned tornadoes...

While Mister Furious watches anxiously.

The Shoveler drives intently, bullets splattering like bugs on the

windshield.

But suddenly something under the hood blows up; the engine gives a long

groan, and the Herkimer rolls to a dead stop...

INSIDE/OUTSIDE THE HERIKINER - CONTINUOUS

Right in the middle, in the most exposed position of the main hall.

More guards arrive and open fire... An armored golf cart with a fifty

caliber machine gun mounted on it comes speeding into the hall,

blasting the Herk...

Inside, the sound of the big bullets is deafening as Shoveler tries to

restart the engine.

ON CASANOVA AND THE CROOKS, watching the monitor and laughing as

bullets pulverize the Herk.

The crooks laugh.

Butsuddenly, the Herkimer's door is thrown open, revealing our heroes--

holding down Doc Heller, his air cannon at the ready. He fires--there

is a WHOOMPH of air--and the mounted gun and a dozen guards are sent

tumbling...

SECURITY DESK - CONTINUOUS - ON CASANOVA AND THE OTHERS

watching, sobered.

BACK IN THE MAIN HALL - CONTINUOUS

as our heroes come charging out of the Herkimer, using their various

skills to blow through the surprised guards.  Mr. Furious comes out

last, not quite sure what to do with himself.

But suddenly, a withering barrage of machine gun fire is being laid

down on them by three guards firing tommy guns from a balcony

overlooking the floor.  Bullets splatter all around them--and several

unlucky guards are hit--but our heroes dive for cover. The Raja tries

to get off a fork, but the firing is too intense.  Our heroes are

pinned down.

ON MR. FURIOUS as he sees... the bag of canned tornadoes. He's got no

superpowers, and he's scared to death, but he grabs a canned tornado.

Bullets dancing all around him, Furious runs a desperate (but

impressive) zig-zag pattern across the floor... He performs a wild

somersault, comes up on his feet, pops open the can, and executes a

perfect jump shot, lobbing it right into the balcony.  The tornado

funnels out, and the guards are sent flying.

ON CASANOVA AND THE TOP CROOKS watching...

CLOSE ON CASANOVA, who knows who they are.

WHILE BACK IN THE HALL our heroes rally around a shaken Mr. Furious.

EXT.  COURTYARD - A MOMENT LATER - ANGLE ON

the security eye watching...

as the panicking security guards retreat under it into the main tower.

BACK TO CASANOVA -

as he types something into the security computer...

ON THE SCREEN a computerized image of the eye appears. Casanova

highlights the word "Activate" and then presses "Enter".

BACK TO THE COURTYARD - ON THE EYE

as it comes to glowing, sinister life...

A hapless guard retreats under the arch--the Eye instantly focuses on

him, and he is hit by a dozen nasty looking laser beams... that SIZZLE

HIM...

A moment later our heroes arrive at the arch.  Furious is about to run

through, but Doc Heller holds him back.

He points to... a man shaped pile of charcoal, all that remains of the

unfortunate guard.

The Raja takes out a butter knife, aims, and hurls it straight at the

eye, but laser beams intercept the knife and instantly melt it into...

a formless blob of silver.

BACK TO CASANOVA AND THE TOP CROOKS -

CORRIDOR - A MOMENT LATER

as Tony P, the top crooks, and the Disco Boys march en masse TOWARD THE

CAMAERA... They are an ugly, formidable looking bunch.

EXT.  COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS

Our heroes are blocked by the eye.

But the Doc is stymied... Suddenly they hear a woman's voice calling

down to them.

EXT.  TOP OF THE FRANKENSTEIN TOWER - CONTINUOUS

Monica leans over the edge of the balcony, the wolf sculpture looming

over her, shouting down at them.

But strong hands suddenly grab her.  It's Casanova.

BACK TO FURIOUS - CONTINUOUS

as high above he hears Monica scream.

BACK TO THE BALCONY - CONTINUOUS

Casanova, hand held tightly across Monica's mouth, shouts down

tauntingly to Furious.

BACK T0 FURIOUS - CONTINUOUS

as he hears Casanova's evil laugh and Monica's scream.  He is desperate

to find a way up, but the wall is completely sheer. He feels helpless-

frantic, near tears...

FLASH TO the terrified little boy trapped in the back of his p8arents'

car, crying, pounding on the windows...

And then... Mr. Furious' hands clench into fists--his hair stands up--

and his face turns into a mask of primordial rage. His button has

finally been pressed.  Be's MAD!  He reaches up as high as he can...

CLOSE ON HIS HAND -

as his fingers literally dig into the concrete of the wall... and he

pulls himself up.

BACK AT THE TOP 0F THE TOWER - CONTINUOUS

Casanova throws Monica onto the bed, puts his hands on her throat and

strangles her as she thrashes helplessly against his immense strength.

BACK TO FURIOUS -

Fifty feet up and climbing.  He pulls himself up, one hand, then

another, digging in his fingernails, catchng his toes on whatever tiny

cracks he can find... as the others gaze up at him.

Meanwhile, Invisible Boy stands staring at the security eye, a look of

fierce determination on his face.  This is his moment.

He takes a deep breath, closes his eyes, and concentrates...

ON FURIOUS as the fingers of one hand lose their grip and a toehold

gives way... For a desperate moment, Furious is dangling off the wall

by the tips of the fingers of one hand. Only his incredible rage keeps

his fingertips taut.

Suddenly, there is a flash of silver, and a large cake fork embeds in

the concrete not far from his head.  Furious grabs hold of it, and

throws a grateful look down to the Raja...

Who salaams up at him...

As Invisible Boy, eyes closed in concentration, walks very slowly,

hands at his sides, in an almost Egyptian pose... toward the eye...

which stares down mercilessly, waiting for its next victim...

we notice that Invisible Boy has become... just slightly transparent.

AT THE TOP OF THE TOWER - CONTINUOUS - ON CASANOVA

a look of pleasure on his face as he strangles Monica.  Her resistance

fades.  Her hands fall away.  She is pale, beautiful, almost gone, a

picture of exquisite death.

Suddenly, we hear someone cursing Casanova in Russian. He turns and

sees... Anabel standing there, pistol in hand.

She succumbs to his charms, and he gently takes the pistol out of her

hand.

A look of terror comes across her face as she sees the murder in his

eyes.

EXT.  ON THE WALL - A MOMENT LATER - ON FURIOUS

still climbing as he hears a scream, looks up... and sees Anabel go

plummeting past him.

ON OUR HEROES down below.

CAMERA HOLDS ON OUR HEROES, wincing as Anabel hits with an ugly thud.

Suddenly they hear Invisible Boy calling to them.

They all turn and see... Invisible Boy, totally visible, but standing

on the other side of the arch.

Invisible Boy turns and sees... a computer screen built into the wall

(with the same image of the eye on it that was on Casanova's computer),

but he doesn't have a clue how to turn it off.  Suddenly, he hears

running feet, turns and sees...

The top crooks and the Disco Boys rushing towards him through the giant

sculptures.  He gets an idea... and stands right in front of the

computer screen.

He makes a face at them--and a dozen guns are instantly fired at him.

He jumps clear behind a pillar--as the bullets smash into the wall...

one of them demolishing the computer screen.

CLOSE ON THE EYE -

as it goes dead.

ON INVISIBLE BOY, hiding behind the pillar... realizing he's been shot

in the shoulder.

BACK ON OUR HEROES -

The villains form a line, bristling with pistols... as our heroes, led

by Sphinx, Shoveler, and Bowler come running through the arch.  The

threesome go shoulder to shoulder (with our other heroes right behind

them) as the villains open fire, laying down a deadly fusillade...

ON SHOVELER, BOWLER, AND SPHINX, standing together, deflecting their

bullets with shovel, bowling ball, and machete... (as they practiced

with pebbles at the farm)... with the Raja right behind them, hurling

silverware...

ON THE VILLAINS, rapid firing... but their own bullets ricochet back

into them, dropping them... They start to fall back.

BACK TO THE TOP OF THE TOWER - CONTINUOUS

Casanova is about to finish Monica.

Casanova turns and sees... Furious, standing on the balcony.

Furious starts at Casanova, who aims Anabel's pistol at him. Furious

hesitates.

Furious lunges at Casanova--who gets off a shot before Furious grabs

the gun out of his hand.  Casanova ducks clear.  Furious tosses the

pistol away... then realizes he's bleeding from a shoulder wound.

He turns on his stereo and the sound of DISCO MUSIC fills the air...

INTERCUT BETWEEN THE TWO FIGHTS - CONTINUOUS

Downstairs, the villains have regrouped.

They charge en mass at our heroes... who are waiting for them...

pinching their noses closed, the Spleen bent over at their forefront...

While Casanova dances around Furious like a cat... Furious, fighting

the pain of his bullet wound, lunges at him, and Casanova neatly

sidesteps him...

The crooks and Disco Boys fall back, gasping, choking in the noxious

fumes...

As Casanova attacks...

Advancing shoulder to shoulder, fighting as a team, our heroes wield

machete, fork, shovel, bowling ball, and canned tornado... forcing the

villains back...

Casanova comes at Furious relentlessly, kicking and spinning...  and

Furious gets the worst of it.

Suddenly, a squad of Disco Boys comes charging at our heroes from the

flank... but Doc Heller turns to face them, shrinker spray held Rambo-

style on his hip.  He lets them have it, blasting them with a DENSE

BLUE SPRAY...

When the spray clears, the D Boys lie squirming on the floor, prisoners

in their now child sized disco suits...

Upstairs, Casanova pummels Furious...

While, downstairs, the Shoveler dispatches the Elvis Brothers with some

nifty shovel work... But suddenly, the Bland Boys, pistols blazing, are

advancing on him, forcing him back against the base of a sculpture.

But the Raja suddenly leaps up onto the sculpture.

The Bland Boys look up and see... the Raja, both hands filled with

silverware... which he HURLS...

A beat later the Bland Boys, bristling with forks and grapefruit

spoons, run screaming through the sculptures... as Tony P, pistol in

hand, skulks out from behind a sculpture and spots... the Bowler.

Upstairs, Furious goes flying against a wall...

As Tony P takes a careful bead on the Bowler.

He opens fire, but she goes instantly into her ball svinging frenzy...

He fires, missing--she's too fast to keep a bead on... Finally, his gun

clicks empty.  She turns and faces him.

She HURLS the ball at him--like a fiery softball pitch.

BALL'S POV -

going straight for Tony P's SCREAMING head...

ON THE BOWLER, watching--as Tony's scream is cut short by a gruesose

thud.

Back upstairs Casanova cornmes at Furious again... but Furious ducks

the kick, pops back up and smashes Casanova with his good arm...

sending him flying across the room... Casanova recovers.

He reaches into his pocket and takes out the remote device (that Anabel

used at the luncheon).  He presses a button...

ON THE WOLF SCULPTURE as the jaws open, its eyes glow red... and the

dreadful sound of the Psychostridulator grinds up and FILLS THE NIGHT

AIR LIKE A SIREN.

Downstairs, the foul noise fills the room and our heroes and the

villains all go into a full blown psychotic episode... The villains

start shooting and stabbing each other.

SERIES OF SHOTS - AROUND THE CITY - CONTINUOUS

On Main Street cars slam into each other.  Pedestrians start screaming

and fightinq... A man and his dog snarl and snap at each other...

The Customers at the Lakeside Diner go insane, hurling plates and

food...

At the Shoveler's house the kids turn psycho in front of the

television...

ANGLE ON A TYPICAL SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD -

as the sounds of screaming and smashing dishes and furniture can be

heard coming from all the houses...

LONG ANGLE OF CHAMPION CITY -

as a din of collective insanity rises up from the city...

BACK TO THE TOP OF THE TOWER - CONTINUOUS - ON CASANOVA

in full psychotic ecstasy...

ON MONICA, still motionless on the bed...

Casanova and Furious collide in the center of the room and grapple in a

contest of psychotically enhanced superhuman strength... Casanova gets

his hands around Furious's throat and crushes it... Furious drops to

his knees, and Casanova thinks he's got him.  But Furious, grimacing

with rage, looks him right in the eye.

Furious grabs Casanova's wrists... and crushes them.  Casanova howls

with pain, loses his grip.  Furious slugs him, again and again... then

he grabs Casanova by the belt, swings him around, and HURLS him into

the air...

Casanova CRASHES into the huge crystal chandelier--there is an

explosion of crystal and glass.  Furious averts his eyes as cut glass

rains down all around him... then he looks up and sees...

Casanova's gold chain has hooked onto a fixture of the chandelier.

Casanova kicks and flails... as he is hanged by the neck on his own

gold chain...

Furious moves to the wolf sculpture.  Be PLUNGES HIS HAND through its

bronze casing, and RIPS OUT the heart of the Psychostridulator, a

flashing football sized device that gives off an unamplifjed, but

higher pitched and more irritating sound...

Furious HURLS the device hard against the floor, and it smashes into a

thousand pieces...

CLOSE ON ONE OF THE PIECES -

In insect sized device that gives off an even higher pitched, even more

disorienting sound.  This is the very nerve center of the

Psychostridulator...

Furious lifts his foot and crushes it hard under his heel...

SILENCE...

Furious drops to his knees, wounded, exhausted... He looks up... at

Casanova, who dangles lifelessly off the chandelier...

SERIES OF SHOTS - VARIOUS LOCATIONS - CONTINUOUS

as our other heroes return to their senses amidst the vanquished

crooks... the traumatized reunants of whom run for it. Things also

return to normal...

On the street...

At the Lakeside Diner...

And at the Shoveler's house...

BACK TO THE TOP OF THE TOWER - CONTINUOUS

Furious moves to the bed, where Monica lies motionless and pale...

He touches her face, her eyes open, and she looks at him.

He takes her tenderly in his arm... as the Raja, the Shoveler and the

others rush into the room and see... Furious and Monica embracing.

EXT.  OUTSIDE THE FRANKENSTEIN CENTER - A LITTLE LATER

Police cars and news vans arrive... as our heroes, battered, wounded,

but victorious walk proudly down the long stairs...

Furious and Monica hold each other up.  Wounded Invisible Boy has his

arm around the Spleen... while policemen and news people run up the

stairs past them into the center, ignoring them as always...

But this time our heroes could care less.  They are superheroes, and

they don't give a damn who knows it.

INT.  THE RAJA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

as the Raja opens the door and enters...

She is there, waiting up for him.

They embrace.

INT. SHOVELER'S DOUSE - NIGHT - CLOSE ON A TV SCREEN

Don Stouffer is reporting.

ON THE SHOVELER'S KIDS, on the couch, still rattled by their psychotic

episode, glued to the TV -

ON THE TV -

Dawn Wong interviews the battered, handcuffed Elvis Brothers as they

are led away...

ON THE KIDS' COLLECTIVE REACTION as they realize who it was... and then

they hear the front door open...

In the front hall the Shoveler enters wearily; his shoulder hurts, his

back is killing him... as his kids come running to him.

They lead him back into the living room, and give him the prime spot on

the couch.

He runs to get it as Eddie Jr. slides a footstool under his feet and

Tracy puts a pillow behind his back.  Roland, the little one, cuddles

up next to him, puts his arm around him.

The Shoveler nods.  A few minutes later... The Shoveler sits on the

couch, feet up, soda in hand. The television is off. His kids all

huddled around him, hanging on his every word.

ON LUCILLE as she comes in and sees... her husband surrounded by his

kids, a happy man at last.

EXT.  LAKESIDE DINER - THE NEXT NIGHT - ESTABLISHING

INT. THE DINER - CONTINUOUS - ON THE SPLEEN

sitting between the Bowler and a bandaged Invisible Boy. The Bowler has

her arm chummily around the Spleen's shoulder. The Spleen finally has

real friends. Doc Heller discusses the art of fork throwing with the

Raja as the Shoveler listens in. The Sphinx sits at the end of the

table, silent.

Monica (in her waitress outfit) sits close to a bandaged Mister

Furious.

ON THE TV -

Dawn Wong reports.

ON OUR HEROES -

They laugh.

They all like it, except for the Bowler.

The others see... that the Sphinx's chair is empty.  Raja spots a

crumpled napkin on the table, opens it up, and reads.

A silence... Reactions from our heroes as they realize that the Sphinx

is gone...

Suddenly, somewhere in the night, a burst of gunfire and screams are

heard.  THE FINAL MUSIC BEGINS...

The Mystery Men wolf their burgers, then stand and start for the

street...

As Monica watches them leave, a PATRON asks her:

JUST OUTSIDE THE DINER - A MOMENT LATER

HEROIC GROUP SHOT as the Mystery Men merch down the middle of street,

toward the sound of the gunfire... and into the night.
