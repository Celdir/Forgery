2   EXT.   SIDESTREET - NIGHT                                     2

They share a grin, pass a BAG LADY who wears a pie-tin crown,

holding her hand out to a PIMP getting into a Cadillac.

The Pimp ignores her, screeches off. The Bag Lady pulls out

a pad, adds his license number to a list, glances up at Rice

and Reilly.

Rice fishes some change out of his pocket.

She pushes her shopping cart away. Rice and Reilly look at

each other, crack up, surprised she knew he was a cop.

4   INT.   BUILDING - NIGHT                                         4

He punches her full force in the face - she collapses,

knocked out cold. Rice rushes over.

Then, over Reilly's shoulder, Rice sees a dark SILHOUETTE

emerging from behind a machine. Rice draws his pistol.

As Reilly whirls, the Silhouette raises a Mac-11.

Rice shoves Reilly aside as the Silhouette OPENS FIRE...

Diving for cover, Reilly flings back his trenchcoat, whips

out his 9mm and RETURNS FIRE at the Silhouette, blowing the

shit out of windows behind, sparks showering off machines.

Silence for an instant, Reilly looks for Rice and finds him

bleeding to death on the floor nearby - he is completely

exposed to the line of fire.

The Silhouette and another FIGURE OPEN FIRE on Reilly.

SWAN, 40s, crazy-brilliant, manic eyes... and one of his men,

pale, sweaty, wearing an EARRING, 30s, continue the barrage.

Swan fires ONE SHOT at a time at Rice, deliberately aiming

not to kill him, trying to flush Reilly out.

Rice screams as BULLETS RIP into his legs. Reilly tries to

reach him but can't, shots forcing him back.

A dark-eyed man with a BEARD appears in the b.g. and stealths

towards Reilly from behind.

Reilly' face is in agony as Rice moans in pain. He glances

urgently from the gunmen to the exit behind them, to The Girl

lying next to him -- what's keeping them there? Obviously

The Girl.

She stirs. Desperate, Reilly grabs her by the hair, shoves

his 9mm to her head. Using her as a shield, he drags her in

front of Rice to protect him.

Swan's eyes flare. He steps out into the open, gun aimed at

Rice, eyes locked murderously on Reilly.

Reilly cocks his hammer, fingers trembling.   The Girl

stiffens, terrified.

Beard emerges behind Reilly. Deadly silent, he raises an

automatic, trying to get a clear shot between machines...

Reilly whirls, sees Beard, shrinks back to stay covered.

A deadly stalemate.   Faraway SIRENS WAIL.

Beard smolders, Earring sweats. Keeping their guns up, the

three men grab tool bags, work their way to the alley door

and slip out.

The moment they're gone, Reilly quickly handcuffs The Girl to

a machine, kneels, cradles Rice.

Rice takes Reilly's hand and pats it on his wristwatch.

Rice's eyes go blank, he exhales his last breath.

Reilly winces, eyes welling up. His gaze moves at the Girl.

The Girl stares uncomfortably, a blink of sympathy stealing

past her hard exterior ...

6   INT.   CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - DAY                                   6

Reilly looks at his watch (we notice he's now wearing Rice's

watch). He taps it, listens to see if it's ticking.

Harry barges in, dumps a bag of personal effects on the desk.

Reilly picks up a twisted plastic-wire bracelet.

10   EXT.   LAKEFRONT STREET - DAY                                  10

The Officer nods and moves the barricade out of the way,

Reilly hits the gas, rumbles through.

The Studebaker swings past a fire truck, an ambulance, and

two squads cars.

Two OFFICERS stand near a building with a worried BUSINESSMAN

and his CHAUFFEUR.

Reilly parks 50 yards from a limo stopped in the middle of

the street. A Bomb Squad van and sleek black Harley Davidson

parked beyond it.

Reilly hops out, heads cautiously for the limo

POOCH, 50s, a barrel-chested ex-football player is on his

hands and knees looking under the limo. Red rubber ball in

hand, Hawaiian shirt half-tucked in, he leads around an

equally scruffy Labrador Retriever, SCHNOZ.

T.J., 20s, a country boy inspects the open trunk.

GLASS, 40s, clean-cut, straight-laced, easy-going smile,

brilliant leader of the team, steps lightly around the open

driver's door.

Reilly stands off 25 feet.    Glass notices him.

Glass and Pooch step lightly to the rear of the limo where

T.J. has discovered a shoebox wedged next to the spare tire.

T.J. leans down, puts his ear to it, nods.

Pooch lifts up Schnoz and holds him over the trunk.    Schnoz

sniffs the shoebox, whines.

Pooch lowers Schnoz back to the ground throws him the red

ball, and trots back to the van, climbs up inside and sits,

watching.

Glass, Pooch and T.J. take a beat just to look at the

shoebox. Then, Glass nods for Reilly to move away.

11   MOMENTS LATER - AT THE BOMB SQUAD VAN                             11

T.J. and Pooch share a laugh as Reilly approaches...

Pooch points to Schnoz.

Reilly holds up the bracelet.    Glass takes it, frowns.

Glass whips out a blasting cap from his utility belt, cuts

off a piece of the bracelet, plugs it in.

Glass tosses it into a sewer drain. A beat, then a small

EXPLOSION, smoke billows out of the gutter drain. The nearby

Officers jump, alarmed. The Bomb Squad guys laugh. Glass

waves to the Officers.

He grabs back the bracelet, turns to leave.

Reilly jogs back to his Studebaker, climbs in and roars off

in a cloud of dirty smoke.

Pooch and T.J. share a laugh as Glass shakes his head, climbs

on his Harley. The others pile into the van.

Glass kicks-starts his hog and rumbles away, van following.

12   INT.   BAR - DAY                                                  12

13   INT.   POLICE STATION - SQUAD ROOM - DAY                         13

He listens, facial expression changing, getting tight.

He punches an intercom button - the whole room stops, looks

up, as Swan's voice comes over the squawk box.

Winters signals frantically for the call to be traced -- cops

spring into action.

Click, the line goes dead.    Winters slams down the phone - no

chance of a trace.

14   INT.   THE CAVE - DAY                                           14

T.J. winks as Bev turns away, hard to get.

Reilly bursts in.

This gets everyone's attention.

The Squad just stands there.

Reilly walks out.   The guys look at each other.   Glass frowns

at the bracelet.

Bev smirks at T.J.'s language, he lowers his eyes.

Pluchinsky starts to laugh as Reilly pops him once hard in

the face. Pluchinsky staggers backwards, grasping his

bleeding nose. Reilly is ready for more as Pluchinsky starts

at him. They exchange a few body shots before several cops

swarm in and pull them apart.

Winters hustles over.

They all turn.

Glass and T.J. stand there, soot-smeared, wearing utility

belts.

Reilly looks at the Captain awkwardly.

Reilly marches after Glass and T.J., leaving Pluchinsky

fuming, holding closed his bloody nose.

ANGLE - ON THE BOMB SQUAD

Reilly follows Glass and T.J., bewildered.

24   INT.   PUB - DAY                                               24

Schnoz ignores them, sniffing a charred beam in a corner.

T.J. points out burn patterns to Glass.

Pooch sniffs dirt, tastes it.

Schnoz whines and paws at something under the beam.   They

scramble over.

Pooch positions himself like a weight-lifter preparing to

dead-lift. He growls as he strains to lift the beam out of

the way. Glass and T.J. jump in and go to work with

toothbrushes and tweezers.

As Reilly watches, fascinated, they uncover a scorched

fragment of a briefcase handle.

Pooch throws Schnoz the red ball.

Reilly looks to Glass for an explanation.

Reilly again looks for an explanation.

25   INT.   POLICE HEADQUARTERS - DAY                              25

Reilly discreetly crosses the room but is intercepted by

Pluchinsky.

Pluchinsky's face turns red with rage as...

An OFFICER holds up a phone urgently.

The room scrambles into action as Winters grabs the phone.

Swan's voice crackles over the squawk box.

Click, dial tone.

Winters slams down the receiver. Cops pull off their tracing

headphones, glance at each other uneasily.

They all look over.   Glass stares back darkly.

They all explode into a SHOUTING MATCH (except Glass who is

in his own world inspecting the microchip an inch from his

eyes). A moments mayhem until-

They all go silent, stare at Reilly (except Glass).

34   INT.   MACHINE SHOP - AFTERNOON                                34

Reilly looks at Glass strangely until he realizes they've

stopped where Rice died.

Reilly fights the memory... eyes well up, his hand trembles

ever so slightly as he points out...

Glass gets down on his hands and knees, scans the floor.

Reilly talks to distract himself.

Glass lays out flat on his stomach and searches deep under a

machine, picks up a half-smoked cigarette butt with tweezers,

pulls it out, kneels.

Glass straightens it out, reads the brand name, "Gallois".

35   EXT.   MACHINE SHIP - GARAGE - AFTERNOON                         35

36   INT.   THE CAVE - AFTERNOON                                      36

Two computer screens - one displays the magnified match from

different angles, the other spills out a stream of formulae

and chemical breakdowns.

At an adjacent computer, Bev runs a scan program on the

match, comparing it against an endless stream of match types

on file. Schnoz howls awake from a nap as T.J. stabs the

screen as a match is made, specifications filling the screen.

37   EXT.   BOWLING ALLEY - LATE AFTERNOON                           37

38   INT.   BOWLING ALLEY - LATE AFTERNOON                          38

39   INT. BOWLING ALLEY - POOL ROOM/BAR - LATER                     39

Glass and T.J. are in the midst of game of pool, nursing

bottles of Root Beer. They continue to play while eyeing

those coming and going.

Reilly enters from the alley, catches Glass' eye and shakes

his head. He goes to the bar and orders a coke.

He takes the drink and moves over next to Glass as T.J. lines

up a shot.

Reilly's attention is drawn to a crowded booth in the corner

where a few bowling alley girls block the view of the entire

booth.

Glass nudges Reilly, they look over to see Pooch entering the

bar. He sees them and moves to the bar. T.J. sinks his shot

and lines up another as Reilly and Glass move to meet Pooch.

Pooch produces a printout from his jacket, opens it up.

T.J. comes over.

They look over to the pool table to see only the cue ball

left.

T.J. sets his empty Root Beer bottle on the bar.

Pooch and T.J. head back to the pool table where two comely

Gals have begun putting the balls back onto the table. T.J.

turns on his smile and chats them up.

T.J. returns, shrugs.

Pooch is still with the girls, showing one of them how to

line up a shot.

T.J. waves over the Bartender. He and Glass orders fresh

drinks as Reilly eyes pretty Blonde across the bar. She

picks up two beers and grabs a pack of matches off the bar.

She turns and moves to the booth in the corner.   The bodies

part and Reilly catches a glimpse of Earring.

Reilly nearly chokes on his coke as Earring takes the matches

from the Blonde. Earring checks his watches, rises. He

looks up and catches Reilly's eye - he smiles--then bolts.

Reilly coughs up his drink and tries to get a word out,

pointing as Earring slips out the exit door next to the

booth.

Glass pats Reilly's back as he gags, eyes blazing.

Finally...

41   INT.   BAR                                                     41

Glass makes a determination, whips out a knife, slashes the

bag open, revealing a computerized nightmare of a bomb

inside.   T.J. rubs his temples with dread.

Glass puts on his magnifying spectacles, starts to probe.

Reilly returns.

Pooch tests hinges with his tweezers. T.J. hands Glass a

crimp. Pooch pries off a back panel, fingers shaking, lifts

it every so slightly, sees complex circuitry inside, the red

glow of a digital readout counting down.

Synchronizing his chronometer to the counter, Glass begins

disengaging sensor switches.

He clips off circuits and booby traps with bloodcurdling

care, peeling away layer after layer of death... shakes his

head with awe, respect, fear.

Finally he comes to the heart of the bomb, a pair of tiny

wires leading to the blasting cap, one yellow, one red.

Precious seconds tick away.

Reilly gulps. The device teeters, slightly, alarming T.J.

and Pooch. Glass nods. T.J. and Pooch each grab a corner of

the device to steady it. Reilly follows their lead and

kneels, goes to reach for a corner as well, one hand starts

to tremble.

Reilly focuses and wills his hands to steady.    He grabs a

corner and closes his eyes, mind over matter.    Sweat streams

as he concentrates like never before.

Pooch and T.J. stare at the wires with intensity.

15 seconds, 14, 13,... Glass pulls out a clipper.

12, 11, 10... He eases the clipper into position.

9, 8, 7... He draws in a breath.

Closing his eyes, he clips the yellow wire.    Reilly's eyes

snap open.

Janie surprises Reilly with a shy kiss, scurries upstairs

with after Pooch, T.J. and Tommy.

Meg clears the dishes, Schnoz is asleep on the floor. Glass

and Reilly are left alone.   Reilly takes a sip of coffee,

hand trembles ever so slightly.

Reilly stares, then opens up slowly.

Reilly holds up his wristwatch.

Winters hangs up.

Winters lets this sink in, then holds up Reilly's report.

Reilly, nods, shifts uncomfortably.

Reilly is shocked.

SHOUTING, mayhem as the team floods into the room.

Pluchinsky brings up the rear. After a beat, Pluchinsky re-

emerges, shaking his head.

AT THE FAR END OF THE MOTEL

Swan and Beard watch from behind a car. Beard gives Swan a

dirty look and they quietly move off around the corner.

AT THE BOMB SQUAD VAN

Reilly and Glass are visibly disappointed.

As the others grumble about it, Reilly notices someone across

the street - the Bag Lady with the pie-tin crown, holding her

hand out to a MAN getting into his car. The Man ignores her,

screeches off. The Bag Lady scribbles down his license

number in her pad. Glass follows Reilly's stare.

Reilly crosses the street, intercepts the Bag Lady as she's

pushing her cart away.

He fishes some change out of his pocket, hands it over,

starts away.

Pooch and T.J. jump out of the Van (leaving a BARKING Schnoz

inside) and sprint towards the Grenada, guns drawn. Pooch is

quickly huffing and puffing. T.J. continues after Beard as

Pooch moves towards the Grenada. The uniforms follow T.J.

Glass on his Harley appears from behind the Van. At the far

end of the street the Studebaker rumbles into view, followed

by a Squad Car, lights flashing. Everyone closing in on

Beard.

T.J. aims and yells at Beard.

Beard whirls around, SPRAYING automatic weapon FIRE at T.J.

and the Uniforms - they hit the pavement.

A few nearby Pedestrians SCREAM and drop to the ground.

Reilly jumps out of his Studebaker as Beard turns his FIRE on

him, BLOWING OUT his windshield.

Back at the Grenada, Pooch ducks for cover by the open

driver's door.

Glass runs his Harley behind a parked car.

The Squad Car behind Reilly SKIDS to a stop and as Beard

shifts his aim, T.J. and Reilly each PUMP TWO SHOTS into

Beard's torso.

Beard spins around, drops - dead silence on the street.

Relief all around. Everyone stands back up. T.J.'s jaw

drops at the sight of actually having hit the suspect with

his bullets.

AT THE GRENADA

Pooch exhales in relief, then hears BEEPING coming from the

front seat of the car. He looks in to see the briefcase

open, countdown ticking away.

89   EXT. SELF-STORAGE WAREHOUSE - DAY                              89

He gets out, disappears into the building.

Mary glances around desperately, sees a phone booth at the

corner. She looks back at the warehouse, the phone again,

terrified.

LOADING DOCK

Yanking her door open, Mary dashes to the booth, searches her

pockets. Empty. She dials zero... it rings and rings, then

finally...

Mary's back is to the warehouse as she waits forever.

Suddenly Mary sees the reflection of a face in the phone

booth glass. She whirls - Swan is standing behind her!

She tries to hang up.   Swan grabs the receiver.

Swan's eyes turn cold, SLAMS down the phone.

Swan grabs Mary, dragging her with him.   A pair of TEENAGE

BOYS on skateboards notice, veer over.

Swan whips out his Mac-11. The Boys skate for cover as Swan

drags Mary back to the U-Haul.

The open back door reveals a number of 55 gallon drums, some

boxes and two milk crates of C4. He SLAMS down the sliding

door, moves around front and shoves Mary inside.

Reilly throws done the mic, takes aim again.

THE U-HAUL

idles.   Swan's rage erupts.       He climbs out with Mary in tow.

ALLEY

Reilly aims carefully...

Swan keeps his Mac-11 to Mary's head. Reilly is frozen by the

move. Swan backs to the rear of the van. He slides up the

door, revealing the drums and explosives to the Bomb Squad.

He reaches in and grabs a remote control.

SIRENS are coming closer, only a block or two away...

AT THE BOMB SQUAD VAN

Glass and T.J. drop their jaws.       They see Swan depress the

remote, arming the explosives.

ALLEY

Reilly leaves the cover of his car and scurries along the

side of the alley, escaping Swan's view.

Swan rages.   He moves around the van, pulling Mary along.

Swan SPRAYS a FLURRY of bullets over Reilly's head... Reilly

dives for cover as bullets rip the alley wall inches from his

face.

Swan whirls and SPRAYS the Bomb Squad Van, dropping T.J. with

a shot to the leg. Bev drops to his aid. Glass grimaces,

having been hit in the shoulder.

Reilly moves forward about to take the shot.

Swan turns back to Reilly, rams his Mac-11 to her throat.

Mary jerks away from Swan.

Reilly fast FIRES.

Swan takes Reilly's SHOTS in the chest. He smiles as he

starts to fall, his hand starts to open up to release the

detonator...

Mary dives onto Swan and grabs at the remote, clasping it in

her hands. Swan collapses, Mary on top of him.

Reilly and Glass sprint at the U-Haul, reaching a trembling,

bleeding Mary.

She clinches her jaw, fighting the grief, holding on to the

remote.

Reilly reaches Mary first and puts his hands over her's - she

looks up into his eyes--distraught.

Glass goes to the explosives and looks over the set-up.

Reilly has never heard Glass swear before...

Glass turns to Mary.

She nods.   Reilly releases her gently, joining Glass at the

van.

Glass stares at the digital read-out on the device anchored

in one of the C4 crates. It reads: "1:30, 1:29..."

Reilly does it the way he saw Glass do it before.

1:18, 1:17, 1:16 ....

Reilly feels around, finally finds an access hole.

Reilly works the hole bigger.

Reilly' hand disappears into the hole.

CLOSE-UP - INSIDE THE BOMB

His fingers snake through complex circuitry as he describes

each layer.

BACK TO SCENE

The red digital numbers keep counting down: 0:38, 0:37, 0:36

Deeper, deeper.

AT THE BOMB SQUAD VAN

The SWAT Van and a unit arrive, Winters and Benson jump out,

the SWAT Team is about to follow-

Winters looks to the action at the U-Haul, sees Reilly and

Glass busy at work. He nods at Benson.

0:30, 0:29, 0:28...

Finally Reilly' fingers touch a button object. We hear the

SWAT Van and the unit retreat at the end of the alley.

0:19, 0:18, 0:17...

Reilly eyes shift as his hidden fingers feel around...

10... Reilly glares at Glass.

9... His face is dripping with sweat.

8... His fingers shift back to the first cap.

7... They close over it, ready to pull.

6... But then they stop.

5... Reilly frowns.

4... Glass stabs him with a look.

3... 2... Lightning-quick, Reilly' fingers fly back and yank

the second cap out of its base.

The counter stops.    0:01.

Reilly and Glass and stare at it, holding their breath,

hardly daring to believe it's true. They whoop and explode

with relief.

It's over... it's finally over.

Reilly and Glass turn to Mary who has lost consciousness but

is still holding the remote tightly.

T.J., Glass and Bev start laughing.   After a beat, Reilly

joins in heartily.
