AN AMERICAN FLAG

Oddly still, posted in gray dusty sand.

WIDEN TO REVEAL:

EXT. LUNAR SURFACE - THE MOON

One small step for man, one large pile of garbage for moon-

kind.  Untouched for years, the flag stands next to the

castoff remains of the Apollo mission.  Slowly the discarded

equipment begins to RATTLE and SHAKE.

AN ENORMOUS SHADOW creeps towards us blotting out the horizon,

a loud RUMBLE is heard.

Suddenly we are covered in DARKNESS as the SHADOW engulfs us.

Only the lonely image of our EARTH hangs in the air, until a

huge silhouetted OBJECT suddenly blocks our view.

something.

Tech Three slides over to another computer.

Tech Three just stares at his screen in disbelief.

The Supervisor reaches over and turns up the volume on the

The General walks over to a phone, picks it up.

Whitmore hands her the phone and gets out of bed.  Habitably

he turns on the television.

T.V. - NEWS PROGRAM

Several "Pundits" sit around a MaLaughlin-type news discussion

program.  The picture quality is snowy, static ridden.

Whitmore ties on his robe as he adjusts the picture quality.

Suddenly the channel changes.  A cartoon comes on.  Whitmore

turns to his daughter who holds he remote.

Whitmore exits the room.

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

As Whitmore steps out of his bedroom, a Security guard snaps

An AIDE appears at the doorway.

Whitmore goes to the phone, picks it up.

AN OLD RUSSIAN SATELLITE

Drifting away from us the old Russian satellite becomes

smaller and smaller.  We PAN with it as we SEE it's on a

collision course with something huge.

Suddenly the satellite EXPLODES on IMPACT with the much larger

object that dwarfs the puny piece of hardware.  As huge as it

is, we get the feeling we've only seen a portion of the total.

Eleven-year-old TROY BRENNON tries to fix the television.

His older brother MIGUEL, seventeen, cooks breakfast.

Miguel sits a small bottle of medicine and a spoon down in

front of Troy.  Troy pushes the bottle away.

His sister, ALICIA, fourteen, hormones kicking in, testing

boundaries, listens to her walkman while putting on too much

makeup.  Miguel throws a dish towel to get her as Troy hits

the television again.

EXT. TRAILER PARK - SAME - MORNING

A beat up pick-up truck comes down a dirt road and skids to a

Alicia opens the front door and smiles flirtatiously at the

angry farmers, LUCAS, who marches over.  Miguel edges her out

Lucas holds a bowl full of rotted vegetables.

Unceremoniously, he dumps them at Miguel's feet.

Troy SMACKS the television again.

Lucas storms away.  Again, Troy whacks at the television.

Determined, Troy HITS the television again.  This time the

picture goes out completely.

Rolling over us, the immense under-belly of this enormous

Dozens of large sections begins to DISENGAGE, extracting

The separated SEGMENTS themselves are enormous.  Slowly they

insecticide wildly, the plane zigzags over the field.

Looking down from the cockpit, RUSSELL BRENNON waves stupidly.

Shaggy blonde hair and two days' growth, Russell is the image

of a fifty-one-year-old little boy.

Miguel follows him below, screaming at him.  Russell, flying

recklessly, looks down at Miguel not understanding.  By the

time he looks back he SEES...

A LINE OF TREES

at the edge of the field, nearly on top of him.  In a trick

move, Russell turns the plane on ITS SIDE, and SLICES through

the narrow gap between the trees.

Miguel screams with delight at his prowess.  Miguel looks

pissed.

ANGLE - OTHER SIDE OF TREES - MOMENTS LATER

Miguel races over, skidding to a halt next to the landed Bi-

Pissed, Miguel peels away, kicking gravel back at Russell.

Pathetically, he reaches into his jacket and pulls out a

The Bedouin watches them with confusion.  Overcome with

As the Bedouin reaches the top of the hillside, his mouth

falls open, aghast as he SEES...

Constance Halbrook comes rushing into the room and whispers to

the President.

Constance moves over to a cabinet and turns on the T.V. (the

DOZENS OF CARS HEADING STRAIGHT FOR THEM

In the attempt to get out, hundreds of cars have been re-

directed by the military to use the opposite side of the

highway.

Moishe SWERVES violently to avoid collision, barely missing

the oncoming traffic.  Dodging right to left, Moishe hangs on

for dear life.

A Military Office, assisting in diverting the cars turns just

in time to see the Olds whiz by.

David and Moishe are bounded around the inside of the car as

Moishe tries to veer through traffic.

Suddenly A TRUCK  blocks off their only escape route.

Moishe turns HARD and drives up onto the right shoulder.

The Olds is the only car in headed that direction.  Using the

As Steve sits he SEES some envelops stuck into the side of his

locker.

He flips through the envelops and FREEZES when he sees one

with the NASA insignia on it.  Jimmy snatches it away from

him.

Steve quickly snatches it back, right it open and reads.  From

the disappointment on his face we can tell it's bad news.

Realizing, Jimmy puts a hand on Steve's shoulder.

Steve crumples at the letter and tosses it.  Angrily he opens his

locker.  Pasted on the locker door we see photos of Jasmine

next to the photos of the space shuttle, Apollo Missions, and a

NASA insignia bumper sticker.

As Steve stuffs his jacket into the locker, something falls

out.  Before Steve can grab it, Jimmy snatches it up first.

Steve snatches it back, embarrassed.

Steve knows he's right.  He's torn.

EXT. WHITE HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

The Olds stops near the White House.  From here we can SEE

tanks and armed patrols.  A small group of protesters have

gathered, upset about the military hardware.  Signs: "Don't

provoke" "Violence begets Violence."

INT. ODS - CONTINUOUS

David adjusts a small portable satellite, connecting it to his

phon and laptop computer.

David flips open the phone, dials the number on the screen.

Shooting his father a look.

INT. WHITE HOUSE - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Constance is just finishing a call on her cellular phone.

The moment she hangs up, it RINGS.  Surprised, she answers.

Constance looks up to the large glass windows.  She walks over

to it, looking out.

CONSTANCE'S POV - STREET - OLDS - DAVID

Between two of the tanks outside, Constance can SEE David

standing on top of the Olds across the street.  Moishe steps

out, waves.  Constance is stunned.

INT. BRENNON TRAILER - NIGHT

Sulking, Alicia sits in back with he walkman on.  Troy sleeps

while Miguel drives.  Suddenly Miguel his the brakes, as

something comes SAILING DOWN FROM THE SKY.

We realize it's the B-WING PLANE landing on the stretch of

roadway directly in front of them.

EXT. ROADWAY - CONTINUOUS

The plane lands, skids into a turn.  Russell jumps out, walks

over to the trailer.  We can tell he's drunk again.

Miguel moves to meet Russell away from the trailer, not

wanting the others to hear.

Miguel explodes, this has been building up for some time.

Russell is momentarily silent, stunned.  Recovering...

Suddenly we hear glass CRASHING.  Both men spin to find Troy

standing behind them.

Miguel leans down to see the broken MEDICINE BOTTLE on the

floor.  Miguel rushes over to him, furious.

Frustrated, Miguel shoves Troy aside and heads back into the

trailer.  Wobbly from the drinking, Russell stands there

pathetically, watching.

EXT. ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE - NIGHT

A large group of press rush over toward FOUR APACHE

HELICOPTERS, each refitted with a large LIGHT BOARDS, as they

slowly lift off the ground.  Cameras flash, reporters yell

questions to the Officers assigned to keep them at bay.

Several news organizations do stand up remotes.  We TRACK past

them to the CNN crew.

INT. BRIEFING ROOM - WHITE HOUSE - SAME

On the television plays the CNN broadcast.  The reception is

intermittently disrupted.

We WIDEN to reveal a large contingent of military personnel

along with the President's chief advisors gathered around

several monitors, (the center monitors are momentarily blank).

Suddenly everyone snaps to attention as the President enters.

INT. OFFICE OF THE COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR - SAME

Moishe inspects a photo of Constance with the President,

impressed he nods with approval.

Constance is looking at David's laptop displaying the

breakdown of the alien signal.

Constance runs her fingers through her hair, exasperated.

Moishe turns, listens.

Surprised at his son, Moishe steps forward.

APACHE HELICOPTERS

ZOOM by overhead.  In the distance we see they are headed for

the enormous alien craft.

INT. HELICOPTER - PILOT - CONTINUOUS

The PILOT adjusts his radio.

EXT. SKIES - CONTINUOUS

The choppers alter their formation, aligning themselves

alongside one another.  As the helicopters near the craft, we

see how tiny they appear against the gargantuan space ship.

INT. HALLWAY - ELEVATORS - WHITE HOUSE - MINUTES LATER

The elevator doors open and Moishe steps out, overwhelmed and

impressed.  Constance leads them down the hall.  Moishe turns

to David, whispers.

INT. OVAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

The Office is empty as the trio walks in.  Moishe can't

believe he's in there.  He straightens himself up, combs his

hair.

David sets up his laptop.

INT. BRIEFING ROOM - NIGHT

The middle monitors are now on.  They show the night vision

P.O.V. of the helicopters as they approach.  On the side

monitors we SEE the various news broadcast of this event.

On the middle monitor, through the night vision camera on the

lead helicopter we SEE the side of the craft as the

helicopters near. Everyone in the room watches, tense.

Constance enters and kneels down next to the President,

whispering in his ear.  The President gets up and follows

Constance.  Chief of Staff Nimziki objects.

The President silences him with a look.  As they exit.

INT. OVAL OFFICE - SAME

The door flies open and Constance and the President enter.

The moment President Whitmore sees David, he freezes.

Moishe, bursting, steps forward.

With a BANG, David suddenly KNOCKS everything off the

President's desk and starts to draw on the ink blotter.

David draws a circle representing Earth and a smaller circle

just away from it.  The President reluctantly nears.

Drawing a line from the ship of either side of the Earth, we

SEE that you could not send a signal to the other side.

David draws small satellites surrounding Earth.

Suddenly an aide, ALEX, appears in the doorway.

The President turns to the monitor in his office.  We SEE the

helicopters turning on the light boards affixed to the front

of their cockpits.  He turns back to David.

EXT. HELICOPTERS - SAME - NIGHT

The large light panels TURN ON, multi-colored lights slowly

begins to flash in a repeating sequential patterns.

REVERE ANGLE - HELICOPTERS AND SPACE CRAFT

The helicopters are puny little specs next to this Goliath.

The light boards continues to FLASH but there is no reaction

from the ship.

INT. BRIEFING ROOM - SECONDS LATER

Everyone is glued to the monitors as the President storms in.

General Grey obeys, turning to an assistant who quickly grabs

a phone.  Nimziki steps up to the President.

An AIDE motions to the monitors.

The room goes silent, everyone turns to the monitors.

MONITOR - NEWS PROGRAM & NIGHT VISION VIDEO

On all screens we SEE the space ship as a long thin line of

WHITE LIGHT suddenly emits from the side of the craft,

illuminating the four Apache Helicopters.

EXT. APACHE HELICOPTERS - SAME

The light boards are overpowered by the bright light coming

from the space craft.  Suddenly with a loud SCREECHING NOISE,

the white light spills out as the huge OPENING unfolds at the

side of the craft.

The four helicopters have to flight to hold their positions, as

something powerful emits from the schism in the ship.

Then like a gigantic bug-zapper, the four pesky little Apache

Helicopters are BLOWN OUT OF THE SKY, one by one.  They leave

no time to retreat.

INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

Mrs. Whitmore packs her bag, as the horrifying image of the

destruction of the helicopter replays on the T.V.

She slams her valise SHUT and quickly exits.

POLICE HELICOPTER

SOARS over us, headed directly for downtown Los Angeles.

EXT. ROOFTOP - SAME

The UFO true believers are still there, holding up their

signs.  Making her way through several of them we see

She looks up to the spacecraft above.

She digs her drawing of an alien out of her purse as she

excitedly rushes up to the others.  She holds it up to the

sky, proudly.

POLICE HELICOPTER

From out of nowhere the helicopter LIFTS up over the side of

the building, shining its spotlight down the believers

below.

The sign holders begin to "boo" the police, ignoring them.

EXT. CITY STREET - PASADENA THROUGHWAY - SAME

The freeway is packed on both sides, every car headed out of

town.  There is no opposing traffic.

INT. JASMINE'S CAR - SAME

Dylan holds Boomers as Jasmine drives.  The news plays over her

car radio.

EXT. WHITE HOUSE - SAME

The Presidential helicopter lifts off as several other

helicopters wait behind, people filing into them.

EXT. ROOFTOPS - LOS ANGELES - SAME

The Police helicopter is still flashing their lights at the

UFO believers who refuse to budge.  Suddenly the entire

rooftop is BATHED IN WHITE LIGHT.  They all grow silent

staring up at the craft.

Above them another SCHISM has opened at the bottom of the

craft, the white light spilling out.

As though the heavens had opened, the UFO believers lift their

arms, waiting to be taken.

Slowly, this beam of light from the base of the ship

INTENSIFIES directly on the top of this building.

EXT. HELIPORT - SAME

Standing on this rooftop heliport directly across from the UFO

believers, the First Lady watches them, concerned.

Reluctantly, the First Lady turns and runs for the helicopter.

The door is shut and the helicopter takes off.

EXT. THE CAPITOL BUILDING - SAME

With a ROAR, the Presidential helicopter ZOOMS past, behind it

we see an enormous SCHISM opening

the space craft.

EXT. WHITE HOUSE - SAME

Alex is helping people get onto the remaining helicopters.

Suddenly he is bathed in WHITE LIGHT.  He looks up and sees

the SCHISM, its WHITE BEAM coming directly down upon the White

House.

EXT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING - SAME

The pinnacle of this landmark is abruptly illuminated in WHITE

LIGHT.  We PAN UP to the space craft above, the beam

intensifying from the SCHISM below the ship.

EXT. ANDREWS AIR FORCE BASE - SAME

The Presidential helicopter lands.  The President and his

group are ushered over to AIR FORCE ONE which stands only

hundred yard away.

INT. AIR FORCE ONE - SAME

The door OPENS and the President and his advisors rush in.

David flops down into a seat, quickly flips open his laptop

which reads: 00:05, 00:04...

EXT. ROOFTOP - LOS ANGELES - SAME

As the light amplifies, the believers chant, louder and

louder.  Suddenly the white light DISAPPEARS.  The believers

are stunned.  In a brief moment it is replaced with a BLAST.

A DESTRUCTION BEAM BLASTS down onto the rooftop, splintering

everything there, Police helicopter included, into a billion

tiny particles.

Tiffany is he epicenter, from here the WALL OF DESTRUCTION GROWS

outwardly, destroying everything in its path.

EXT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING -  SAME

Just as the BLAST HITS, the historic building is DECIMATED.

EXT. WHITE HOUSE LAWN -  SAME

Alex shuts the door on a helicopter.  As he steps back the

white light VANISHES.  He looks up as the BLAST replaces the

beam.

ANGLE - WHITE HOUSE

Just as one of the helicopters pass us, the White House

SPLINTERS BEFORE OUR EYES.

EXT. ANDREWS - RUNWAY - AIR FORCE ONE - SAME

Air Force One quickly taxis down the runway toward us.

Behind them in the distance we can SEE the DESTRUCTIVE beam

GROWING OUTWARDLY from the epicenter.

THE CAPITOL BUILDING

The WALL OF DESTRUCTION reaches the Capitol Building,

fragmenting into a trillion particles.

THE PENTAGON

Washed under the WALL OF DESTRUCTION, the Pentagon, too, is

blown to smithereens.

INT. AIR FORCE ONE - SAME

Thick with tension.  Everyone is white-knuckled, anxious for

take off as they taxi quicky down the runway.

EXT. ANDREWS - RUNWAY - AIR FORCE ONE

Air Force one, full throttle.  It LIFTS OFF just in time to

miss the WALL OF DESTRUCTION as it rips apart the airport

behind them, dangerously close.

WIDE ANGLES - WASHINGTON, D.C.

We SEE the WAVE OF DESTRUCTION growing outwardly from the

epicenter, ENGULFING ALL OF WASHINGTON.

Air Force One is just barely making it out in time.

EXT. PASADENA FREEWAY - SAME

Jasmine's car is caught in traffic just outside the tunneled

underpass at the Griffith Park Mountains.

Suddenly the radio CUTS OUT.  Jasmine turns around and SEES...

JASMINE'S POV - FREEWAY & DOWNTOWN

Far off the devastation of downtown can be seen.  The WALL OF

DESTRUCTION growing towards us.

Reacting, Jasmine grabs Dylan and dashes out of the car.

Boomer follows.  Every drivers who can, jumps out of their

cars, running in all directions.

Jasmine heads for the tunnel.

ANGLE - FREEWAY

The grid-locked cars have nowhere to run as the WALL OF

DESTRUCTION grows out from downtown.  All the cars are WIPED

OUT in a row, sitting ducks.

ANGLE - OVERPASS - BRIDGES

Packed with cars.  They're quickly demolished as the WALL OF

DESTRUCTION blasts by.

INT. TUNNEL - SAME

Jasmine turns back from the tunnel entrance.

JASMINE'S POV - WALL OF DESTRUCTION

Ever nearing, only moments away.

Jasmine spots an open MAINTENANCE ALCOVE deep within the

tunnel.  She runs to it, puts Dylan inside and climbs in after

him.

Leaning back out, Jasmine looks for Boomer who stares at her,

wagging his tail.

Boomer LEAPS inside and Jasmine ducks to the side of the WALL

OF DESTRUCTION hits the tunnel entrance, cars are JAMMED

TOGETHER, SMASHING into one another.

Suddenly the car ARE BLOWN CLEAR THROUGH THE TUNNEL like so

many toy Hot Wheel cars.

Inside the Maintenance alcove, Jasmine shields Dylan and

Boomer with her body.

EXT. MANHATTAN - WIDE ANGLE - SAME

From a distance we WATCH as all of Manhattan is consumed from

its center outwardly by the growing WALL OF DESTRUCTION.

Within seconds all of Manhattan is gone.

The WALL OF DESTRUCTION reaches its outer most edges and fades

away.

The SCHISM under the craft slowly CLOSES.  The ship now hovers

over a completely wiped out Manhattan.

INT. BRENNON TRAILER - PRE-DAWN

A hand adjusts the trailer radio.

Russell shoots a worried look over to Miguel.  Suddenly Troy

moves up to the front on wobbly legs.

Troy looks really sick.  Miguel is shocked.

EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - SAME

The trailer, with Russell's Bi-wing in tow, pulls over.  Troy

rushes out, vomiting on the side of the road.  Miguel comes to

his aide.  Russell steps out and walks to the curve in the

highway.

Reluctantly Miguel leaves his brother's side.

POV - RUSSELL AND MIGUEL

Below an entire valley filled with campers, trailers and

busses.  An instant refugee city, if you will, for as far as

the eye can see.  Spectacular.

INT. EL TORO - BRIEFING ROOM - MORNING

Thirty-five pilots are being briefed by their Commanding

Office, CAPTAIN WATSON who points to a fuzzy photograph of

the craft over Los Angeles.

Steve and Jimmy sit next to each other near the back of the

Jimmy chuckles.  Watson is annoyed.

Steve smiles confidently.

Everyone chuckles, including Captain Watson.

EXT. EL TORO MARINE CORPS AIR STATION - MOMENTS LATER

Huge hangar doors open revealing an F/A-18 HORNET, one of the

U.S.A.F.'s elite.

TARMAC - OVERHEAD SHOT

Thirty F/A-18s await take off on the tarmac as Technicians and

Flight Crews race for position.

ENGINE BLAST

The heat waves momentarily obscure our view as the F/A-18s

take to the air.

INT. AIR FORCE ONE - SAME

The President is deeply contemplative.  Constance sits down

next to him.  She knows what he's thinking.

Constance realizes there's no comforting him.  She supports

him silently by being there.  General Grey comes over.

The news rocks the President.  They both know what that means.

Whitmore nods and follows the General to the back of the

plane.

COMMAND CENTER - AIR FORCE ONE

Military Command has been set up on Air Force One, a kind of

flying NORAD.  Military and technical crew are seated at the

controls.  Nimziki is already there.

Maintaining his composure, the President looks up at the many

tracking screens.

EXT. BLUE SKIES - TACTICAL FIGHTERS - SAME

Five F/A-18 fighters move into frame.  As we WIDEN we REVEAL a

total of 30 F/A-18s in attack formation, destination Los

Angeles.

Steve pulls a long cigar out of his breast pocket.

INT. JIMMY'S FIGHTER - SAME

Jimmy pulls his cigar out.  Examines it.

INT. AIR FORCE ONE - PASSENGER SECTION - SAME

Air sick, David holds a "barf bag" as Moishe talks.

Moishe pats his belly.

David can't take any more of this story and takes off running

for the bathroom.

Constance comes over, sits next to Moishe.

Constance smiles, corrects him.

EXT. SKIES - SAME

In the distance we can see the devastated Los Angeles, the

space craft still hovering above it.  The Fighters zoom into

frame.

INT. STEVE'S FIGHTER - SAME

Steve looks down, becomes worried.

Steve nods absently.

INT. AIR FORCE ONE - SAME

The center F/A-18 on the radar map begins to FLASH yellow,

just under its image.  We SEE a video display of its FLIR

(forward-looking infrared) targeting system, locked on.

EXT. STEVE'S FIGHTER - SAME

An Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) DROPS

down from the underbelly of the fighter, DARTING OFF.

Radar targeted, the missile BANKS hard, adjusting.  We SEE it

is joined by FOURTEEN other missiles, all rocketing towards

their target.

EXT. ALIEN SHIP - SECONDS LATER

The missiles are headed straight for the alien ship.

Suddenly about a quarter mile before they reach it, they

EXPLODE, as though blown out of the sky.

When the smoke clears we see there has been zero damage.

INT. STEVE'S FIGHTER - SAME

EXT. SKIES - SAME

In unison these amazing birds DIVE together, realigning

themselves into six groups of five, spreading out to attack

different areas of the ship.

STEVE'S GROUP

The first attack group, Steve's, are the first to near the

colossal alien craft. Simultaneously they drop their AIM-9

sidewinder missiles.

PACK OF AIM-9 SIDEWINDER MISSILES

They reach the same quarter-mile proximity and EXPLODE.

INT. STEVE'S FIGHTER - SAME

Most of the fighters do, but one is too late and SMASHES into

the ship's protective shield.

EXT. SKIES - SAME

Steve's squadron BANKS hard, skirting the edge of the ship's

protective shield.

As the fighters approach, the alien ship's enormous ATTACK BAY

doors OPEN.  Suddenly DOZENS OF ALIEN ATTACKERS dart out

towards our fighters.

Just moving away in time, our Fighters barely dodge the

oncoming enemy Attackers as they FIRE a HAILSTORM of FIREPOWER

(tracker bullet-like lasers) showering the sky.

As Steve's plane DIVES, an Attacker follows.  Jimmy's plane

pulls up behind the attacker.

HEADS UP DISPLAY - HUD

Jimmy's HUD has the alien attacker in his sights.

Jimmy FIRES, another AIM-9 Sidewinder TAKES OFF.

ALIEN ATTACKER

The Sidewinder overtakes the attacker as Steve ROLLS AWAY out

of position.  Five yards before the sidewinder can get to the

Attacker, it EXPLODES.

STEVE'S FIGHTER

Banks back around to get a shot.  Just as he turns, three

American Fighters are BLOWN TO RIBBONS from Attacker tracer

fire.

The Attackers are in hot pursuit of Jimmy's fighter.  The

Fighter flying next to Jimmy is DEMOLISHED.

Jimmy's fighter narrowly rolls away from the tracer fire as

Steve fires another Sidewinder, momentarily distracting the

Attacker.

Jimmy falls in line with Steve as the attackers turn on them.

Both fighters jerk downwards at a ninety degree angle at MACH

ONE.  Narrowly missing the ground, they bank away.  The

Attackers can't follow.

INT. AIR FORCE ONE - SAME

Fighter after fighter begin to disappear from the display

screens.

Suddenly one of the large radar display maps FIZZLES OUT.

Before he can adjust, another monitor FIZZLES AWAY.

EXT. LOS ANGELES - SAME

One by one we SEE the fighters getting TAKEN OUT.  Fireballs

litter the laser-tracer fire covered skies.

Jimmy and Steve bank away from the craft, hit the supercruise,

BOLTING AWAY at Mach 2.

Both  Jimmy and Steve are held tight against their seats,

straining against the G-Force.

Two Attackers spot them and follow in hot pursuit.

Steve and Jimmy are flying at breakneck speeds, the attackers

slowly gaining on them.

Readouts show the  planes flying beyond measurement.

INT. JIMMY'S FIGHTER - SAME

As the  planes accelerate, Jimmy fights to remain conscious.

Jimmy slowly loses consciousness.  His fighter slows, drifting

off to the right.

ALIEN ATTACKERS

gain on them.  One catches up with Jimmy's fighter and FIRES.

JIMMY'S FIGHTER

Laser-tracers SHOWER the Fighter.  It EXPLODES.  Job done, his

Attacker banks away, returning to Los Angeles.

Steve's Attacker stays right with him, slowly gaining.  Steve

kicks his harder, keeping the distance.

INT. EL TORO - AIR TOWER - SAME

A radar OPERATOR spots something on his screens.  He turns to

Captain Watson.

Watson hits an alarm which ROARS.

EXT. EL TORO - TARMAC - SECOND LATER

A dozen PILOTS race out onto the field, running for their

planes.  Before anyone can reach them, the sky darkens with

ALIEN ATTACKERS who STRAFE the runway.

INT. TOWER - SAME

Through the front glass of the tower we SEE the Attackers

firing.  One fires directly at the tower.  Watson DIVES for

cover as everything around him erupts into a gigantic

FIREBALL.

WIDE ANGLE - EL TORO

The entire base goes up in flames.

EXT. SKIES - FIGHTER & ATTACKER - SAME

Steve looks down over the side of his fighter.

STEVE'S POV -

- SAME

Steve HITS THE BRAKES.  Surprised, the Attacker SAILS PAST.

Taking the moment, Steve DIVES down INTO THE GRAND CANYON.

The Attacker recovers, dives after Steve who flies dangerously

close to the canyon walls.  The Attacker has trouble keeping

up with him but does.

Steve puts on a clinic in advanced aerobatics, banking,

diving, swerving.

The Attacker seems to be improving, following closer and

closer.

Steve ducks into smaller canyons, twisting sideways.  Still

the Attacker follows close.

FUEL GAUGE - RUNNING LOW

Near empty.  Frustrated, Steve gets pissed.

Steve turns down a dead and side canyon.  The Attacker is

right on his tail.

The Fighter is on a collision course with the end of the

canyon wall.  Suddenly Steve yanks his ACES II - EJECTION

SEAT.

Stave SAILS UPWARDS into the air.

The Fighter CRASHES into the canyon wall.

The Attacker can't turn in time.  He tries to pull up, over

it, just misses the top of the canyon wall.

As the nose of the Attacker hits the tip of the canyon wall

the Attacker is FLIPPED OVER, ROLLING END OVER END over the

top of the canyon.

The parachute on Steve's ejection seat pops OPEN.

EXT. TOP OF CANYON - CONTINUOUS

Rolling end over end, the Attacker is banged up BADLY as it

finally comes to a stop.

Not far away, Steve has a quick, hard, landing.  Rolling over,

Steve quickly pops the buckles on the chute and frees himself.

He stands and looks around.  Spotting the beat up and

incapacitated alien Attacker, Steve gets an angry resolved

look.  He marches over to the fallen alien Attacker.  He scans

it quickly, spots a type of door that has been knocked ajar.

With all his might, Steve YANKS the door OPEN.

AN ALIEN

For the first time we get a quick glance at these aliens, an

odd hybrid creature with fluctuating skeletal structure.

The reason we only get a quick glance is because the moment it

turns woozily towards us, Steve rears back and SLUGS HIM IN

THE FACE, knocking the alien totally unconscious.

His anger finally subsiding, exhaustion taking over, Steve

stands over the craft, slowly withdrawing the prized Victory

Dance cigar.  He lights it and takes a long angry puff.

INT. TUNNEL - PASADENA FREEWAY - ALCOVE - SAME

It's dark.  The hole Jasmine had entered is now blocked.  She

pushes but it won't budge.  Exhausted, she ignites her lighter

to get a better look around.

As it lights we SEE that we are inside a maintenance garage.

Jasmine rushes over to a phone but the line is dead.  Taking

Dylan by the hand she moves to the large garage doors but she

can't open them.

She turns around and see a large maintenance truck, a huge

land-mover shovel attached to the front.  She smiles.

EXT. GARAGE DOORS - SECONDS LATER

With a ROAR the large door BLAST APART as the maintenance

truck SMASHES through.  Once out, Jasmine hits the brakes.

REVERSE ANGLE - JASMINE'S POV - DEVASTATED L.A.

Total devastation.  Remnants of cars and buildings smoldering.

Three scattered survivors crawl from the wreckage.  A

nightmare of destruction.  The space craft above, slowly

leaving.

EXT. DESERT - REFUGEE TRAILER CAMP - DAY

We see dozens of trailers packing up their gear, some already

on the road.  Miguel talks with one of the drivers, then

hurries away, running.

INT. BRENNON TRAILER - SAME

Russell wipes down Troy's forehead, he's burning up.  Alicia

brings over a cold compress.

Miguel comes rushing in, pulls Russell aside.

Russell nods in agreement.  A knock on the door.  Alicia turns

to find a handsome young boy, PHILIP in the doorway holding a

bottle of pills.

Alicia nods, smitten.  Philip smiles charmingly and leaves.

INT. AIR FORCE ONE - SAME

Back in the passenger section, the President sits with General

Grey and Chief of Staff Nimziki.  The Technician from the

command module is briefing them.

The Technician nods and exits.  Defeated, the President slumps

sullenly.

The President nods his approval absently.  Coming out of the

bathroom, David overhears.

The Technician returns, his face is white with fear.

That stings the President.  He considers the option.  David is

shocked.

David pushes past her.

The General gets up running interference.  Constance tries to

pull David back.

Suddenly Moishe is on his feet, interrupting.

As everyone is about to besiege Moishe, the President tries to

calm him down.

For the first time in along time, President Whitmore smiles.

Chief of Staff Nimziki suddenly clears his throat.

The President and General Grey turn to Nimziki, shocked.

SMASHED AND BURNED OUT CARS

laying across the roadway.  Suddenly SMASH, Jasmine's

maintenance truck BLASTS through.

EXT. HIGHWAY - CITY LIMITS - SAME

With the massive devastation in the b.g., Jasmine drives the

maintenance truck down the highway.  In the back, the few

survivors she's found.

In the back, four INJURED PASSENGERS lay across the flatbed as

a thin, older man, TEDDY tends to them.

INT. MAINTENANCE TRUCK - SAME

Jasmine spots a TALL MAN, his closes in tatters RUNNING down

the highway, his arms in the air.

Jasmine pulls up along side him.

The tall man moves off, screaming to the heavens.  As Jasmine

watches him drift away she SEES...

OVERTURNED MILITARY HELICOPTER

Still smoldering from the crash.  A woman can be seen inside,

still alive.  Jasmine jumps out.

Teddy joins Jasmine as they pry open the door.  Inside, the

pilots have been killed, but Mrs. Whitmore,

lays there in great pain, blood across her blouse.

They erase her from the wreckage, laying her on the

ground.  Dylan comes over, standing next to his mother.

Suddenly we

the CLICKING of a rifle COCKING.

Jasmine turns and see a REDNECK leveling his rifle at her.

Behind him a small damaged sports car pulls up, packed to the

gills with stolen, looted appliances.

Two GUYS rush from their vehicle over to the maintenance

truck, pulling the injured off the tailback.

Running up from behind, the Tall Man comes over screaming.

The Redneck turns his gun on him.

As the Redneck is distracted, Jasmine spots the bag of

fireworks protruding out of Dylan's back pocket.

The Redneck SHOOTS the Tall Man.  His buddies laugh.

As he turns back to Jasmine, Boomer starts BARKING wildly.

Just as he turns to shoot the dog, Jasmine lights a key ROCKET

from the fireworks bag.  The rocket BLASTS into the Redneck,

his shirt IGNITING ON FIRE.

The Redneck drops the rifle, attempting to put out the flames,

his cronies rush to his aid.  Jasmine picks up the gun, moves

in on them.

She FIRES the rifle.  Quickly the rednecks scamper away.

EXT. DRY LAKE - DESERT - LATER

Dragging a heavy bundle wrapped in his parachute, Steve

marches across the desert floor.  The alien ARM/TENTACLE

dangles out of the parachute.

Exhausted, Steve stops to wipe his brow.  He hears something,

turns around.

STEVE'S POV - THE TRAILER ARMADA

Several hundred of the trailers from the refugee camp are

headed en mass towards him.  Smiling, Steve signals them.

The trailers pull up on either side, surrounding him.  Miguel

leans out of his trailer.

Confused, Miguel checks his map.

EXT. AIR FORCE ONE - LATER

Flying over the desert, Air Force One sails over an immense

valley, Area 51 below - hangars, a few buildings, a small air

strip, not much.

Super:

EXT. RUNWAY - LATER

Air Force One lands.  Wheels touch down, skid.

INT. HANGAR - LATER

The large hangar doors open and Air Force One is rolled

inside.  The President and his entourage are met by a

contingent of base personnel led by field operative, LT.

MITCHELL.  He escorts them to a side hallway.

INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Lt. Mitchell walks over to an odd wall switch as the President

and his entourage wait in the center of the hall.  With a loud

hydraulic HUM, the entire hallway begins to SINK DOWN, an

enormous ELEVATOR.

General Grey shoots Nimziki a pissed off look.  When the

elevator stops, a door SLIDES open.

INT. RESEARCH FACILITIES - CONTINUOUS

Stepping out of the elevator, they walk into a large state of

the art, sterile clean research facility.  It is amazingly

well staffed and organized.

The President shoots him a look.  They are greeted by a group

of SCIENTISTS in whit coats led by, DR. OKUN.

Dr. Okun is an odd, hyper-energetic man who's spent too much

time in isolation.

They walk up a ramp at the end of the room.  Large heavily

enforced doors SLIDE open.

INT. STORAGE LAB - CONTINUOUS

The group steps inside and nearly gasps at...

THE ALIEN ATTACKER

Just like the one that chased Steve.  The entourage stares in

horror and wonder.  We can SEE the patch-work repairs they've

made on the ship over the years.

Moishe leans close to David and Constance.

The President slowly walks around the ship as Okun talks.

David, mouth agape, just stares at it.

The room goes silent, letting the President blow off steam.

INT. MEDICAL RESEARCH VAULT - MOMENTS LATER

The lights slowly TURN ON, illuminated the vault.  Okun leads

the group to a sealed partition.

Okun hits a switch and the sealed partition lifts revealing...

FORMALDEHYDE TANKS - ALIENS

Three dead aliens float in the milky formaldehyde tanks.  The

murky fluid and condensation obstructs our view.  What we do

see is not pretty.

David cannot contain his fascination.  He steps forward.

The President turns to David.

EXT. SECURITY GATE - SAME

Four armed GUARDS watch the gate.  An armada of trucks and

trailers heads right for them.  They move into position to

block their entrance as a blue pick-up skids to a halt before

them.  Steve stands up from the back of the pick up.

Impatiently Steve grabs the Guard by the collar, pulling him

over the side of the truck putting him face to face with the

bundled parachute in the flatbed.  Steve rips the fabric aside

revealing...

THE ALIEN CREATURE

Still unconscious, the alien stirs.  The Guard JUMPS BACK,

shitting in his pants.  Quickly he signals for the other to

open the gate.

The armada quickly drives past.

BLACKNESS

Total darkness.  Suddenly light pours in as a  door is open.

We see the faces of Okun, David and three technicians all

peering at us with inquisitive expressions.

REVERSE - INSIDE ALIEN CRAFT

Sure enough, tons of gizmos with lights flashing.  High tech

meets organic organisms.  This alien ship looks familiar to

our own technology and completely different at the same time.

David climbs in, fascinated.  He touches everything.  Okun

points to everything as he describes it.

David is transfixed by it.  He stares at the small screens

with flashing light patterns on them.

But David still stares at the small screens.

One of the technicians rushes off as Okun leans close.

The technician hands David his retrieved laptop which he

quickly flips open and turns on.

David turns his laptop around for Okun to see.  The pattern on

David's laptop flashes identically as the alien screen.

The two men exchange a smile.  Another TECHY pops his head

inside.

INT. HALLWAY OFF MAIN HANGAR - AREA 51 - SAME

The bundled alien lays on a stretcher that's wheeled quickly

into the hall.  Okun and his staff surround it.  Trailing

behind them is Steve, Russell and Miguel.

Okun ignores Russell, hitting the elevator switch on the wall,

the room begins its hydraulic HUM.

Russell SLAMS his fist against the switch, the room stops.  He

GRABS a doctor nearby, gets in his face.

Miguel is surprised and proud of Russell as he holds DOCTOR

ISAACS, meaning business.

EXT. ROAD - MAINTENANCE TRUCK - NIGHT

Headlights pierce the darkness as the maintenance truck rolls

to a stop.  Jasmine climbs down out of the truck, her face

ashen.

She walks past a sign reading: El Toro Marine Corps Air

Station.  Tears begin to roll from her eyes.  We follow her

gaze to see...

EXT. EL TORO MARINE CORPS AIR STATION - CONTINUOUS

The entire facility is smoldering, the last remnants of the

fire burning itself to extinction.  Jasmine is devastated.

INT. AREA 51 COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT

General Grey and Nimziki are in a heated argument.

Just then the President enters along with Constance and some

other ADVISORS.  He examines a paper map of the United States,

tacked to the wall, each major city circled in black.

The President and his team take seats at the large conference

table.

Grey sneaks an accusatory glare at Nimziki.

The room is quiet.  Constance runs her fingers through her

hair.  The door to the room opens and Lt. Mitchell enters with

Steve.

The President quickly gets to his feet, anxiously shaking

Steve's hand.

The General is concerned but the President is determined.

They head for the door.

Steve is shattered, he had no idea.

EXT. EL TORO BASE - NIGHT

The injured are gathered around a small camp fire.  Jasmine

walks up, dumping a box full of charred can goods.

As Margaret tries to move, she winces in pain.  Jasmine rushes

to her aid.  The color from her face drained, Margaret looks

like she's taking a turn for the worse.

Jasmine adjusts the bandages as Margaret turns and see Dylan

curled up next to Boomer, too adorable.  Slowly he starts to

wake up.

Jasmine becomes sad, remembering.  Margaret changes the

subject.

The bandages changed, Jasmine sits down next to Margaret.

Dylan comes walking over.

INT. CONTAINMENT LAB - NIGHT

Okun and two Medical assistants examine the alien creature.

His arms and chest have been strapped down to the examining

table.

For the first time we get a good look at the head of this

creature, long tentacled-type cords interlocked, covering the

face.  The doctors attach clamps to each of the cords.

The doctors exchange nervous glances, nod to each other.  At

the same moment all they pull on the clamps, unraveling the

interlocked cords.  As the cords unravel, we SEE that this is

in fact a bio-mechanical SUIT as we REVEAL...

THE ALIEN

Beneath the cords lay the unconscious face of the alien, his

skin translucent, his body fluids, capillaries, muscle tissue,

alien's skin.

As Okun begins to put on a pair of surgical gloves he suddenly

grabs his forehead.

Instantly everyone's attention is riveted to the arm of the

alien as it moves beneath the sheet.  Unseen by the others the

alien creature's

Another SHARP PAIN hits Okun who SCREAMS, stumbling backwards

grabbing his head.  The others turn in surprise.

THE ALIEN

Suddenly SPRINGS up, the restraining straps SNAPPING.  Before

Med #2 can react, one of the alien's tentacles SMASHES her

across the face.  She is sent sprawling backwards.

LOW ANGLE - THE ALIEN

Standing before her.  In a wink of an eye, he ATTACKS, leaping

on her.

Together they TUMBLE back into a formaldehyde tank.  Hoses

are ripped from their sides and STEAM pours out.  We get quick

glimpse of their struggle as the steam engulfs them.

INT. HALLWAY - SAME

Mitchell leads the Presidential party down the hall.  They

turn and enter the Medical lab.

INT. CONTAINMENT LAB - CONTINUOUS

The group slows as they enter the room.  They see the

containment room through the glass is covered with white

steam.  Nothing can be seen.  It's eerily quiet.

Cautiously they approach.  Suddenly Okun is SLAMMED AGAINST

the glass partition, the creature's tentacles wrapped around

him.  Pressed firmly to the glass, his eyes are shut, his

expression pained, but when he speaks the voice is angry.

Suspicious, General Grey stops him.

They follow the tentacles with their eyes, up to the ceiling

of the containment tank.  Suddenly the alien LEAPS DOWN,

startling them, landing before them behind the glass.

We see he's holding Okun against the glass, speaking THROUGH

HIM.  This is the first real good look we get at the this bizarre

creature.  Everyone in the room is repulsed and compelled by

it at the same time.

EXT. AREA 51 - NIGHT

Through the hundreds of campers and trailers parked outside,

Steve runs past until he reaches the open tarmac.

A transport helicopter sits on the edge of the landing area.

Steve runs up to it and climbs inside.

INT. TRANSPORT HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS

Steve quickly starts it engines, preparing to take off.  A

SOLDIER rushes over to the cockpit.

The Soldier pulls out his pistol, taking aim.

Steve stares the Soldier down.  Reluctantly he lowers his gun.

Steve smiles and gives him a quick salute then TAKES OFF.

Quickly the bird RISES UP and darts off into the night.

INT. MEDICAL LAB - SAME

The President has moved closer to the glass and is talking

with the alien.  The alien uses Okun like a ventriloquist's

dummy.

The Alien moves closer to the glass staring at the President.

Suddenly the President clutches his head in pain.

The pain becomes more severe and the President SCREAM OUT.

There is general panic as people rush to the President's side.

The General draws his pistol.  Mitchell and the other military

officers follow his lead.  Simultaneously they all begin to

FIRE!

The glass SHATTERS into a billion pieces.  The Alien is cut to

ribbons, falling backwards.

The President collapses.  So does Okun.  A STAFFER rushes over

to Okun, checks his pulse.

General Grey moves to the President who slowly recovers.

Woozily the President sits up, a strange look in his eye.

The President stands with a new resolve.  He stares at the

dead alien on the floor.

INT. STORAGE LAB - MINUTES LATER

The research staff are working near the recovered alien

attacker.  Constance comes rushing in.  She looks around for

David.  Through the glass of one of the offices she sees him.

INT. OFFICES - CONTINUOUS

Holding a bottle of Jack Daniels, David fishes through a small

refrigerator as Constance enters.

David toasts her with the bottle, takes a swig.

David nods, he doesn't want to argue.  He smiles cynically.

David stares daggers at her.

part of something special.

Constance realizes he means their marriage.  She's hurt him

and can see it.  She turns and leaves.

EXT. DARK SKIES - NIGHT

A black shadow is vaguely seen in the dark night.  As we pass

some moonlit clouds we recognize the shadow is, in fact, a B-2

STEALTH BOMBER.

As we WIDEN, we see that the bomber is part of a squadron of

eight.  These mighty winged giants fly together in attack

formation.

INT. COMMAND CENTER - ARE 51 - SAME

A tracking screen comes to life, eight blips flashing.

The President's group takes their position behind the

technicians.

Still there is no answer.

EXT. B-2 STEALTH BOMBER - WEAPONS BAY - SAME

The bay doors open and a large Tactical Nuclear Cruise Missile

drops down, flies parallel with the bomber as it adjusts its

radar and laser tracking.  Suddenly it SHOOTS OFF.

The bomber BANKS AWAY.

INT. B-2 STEALTH BOMBER - SAME

We see the horizon twisting away as we bank off from target.

INT. COMMAND CENTER - SAME

On the big map we see one FLASHING target line tracking the

INT. ARMORED TANK - OUTSIDE HOUSTON - NIGHT

The Tank Commander readjusts the periscope.

TANK COMMANDER POV - SPACE SHIP & B-2 STEALTH BOMBER

We follow the Cruise Missile as it guides itself on a direct

collision course with the space craft.

INT. COMMAND CENTER - SAME

The targeting map shows how close the missile is, nearly on

top of the target.  Everyone in the room holds their breath.

EXT. SPACE CRAFT - SAME

The nuke speeds closer.  It HITS the protective shield and

DETONATES.  A FLASH OF LIGHT.

WIDE ANGLE - HOUSTON

With the B-2 Stealth Bomber in the foreground, the city behind

it vanishes in a FLASH OF LIGHT, blinding us.

INT. COMMAND CENTER - SAME

We can see the extent of the explosion on the targeting map,

tracking it -- an expanding ring around Houston.

The others are still waiting.  The monitor shows the night

vision picture of the growing MUSHROOM CLOUD rising above the

city.

EXT. HOUSTON - WIDE - SAME

The MUSHROOM CLOUD engulfs the horizon.

As the cloud begins to dissipate we see THE SPACE CRAFT IS

STILL THERE, completely unharmed.

INT. ARMORED TANK - SAME

INT. COMMAND CENTER - SAME

On the monitors as well, we can see the target remain.  The

air is let out of the room, everyone deflated.

As the technicians call the bombers away, the President sinks

into a depression.  His last hope of survival gone.

EXT. EL TORO MARINE CORPS AIR STATION - NIGHT

Jasmine keeps Margaret company as the rest sleep around the

last flames of their campfire.  From the worried expression on

Jasmine's face we can tell that Margaret has gotten worse, her

wounds bleeding badly.

A WIND kicks up, the sound of an ENGINE approaching.  Jasmine

squints her eyes looking up into the wind when a BRIGHT LIGHT

engulfs her.

JASMINE'S POV - LIGHTS - NIGHT

Bright lights in the sky growing nearer.  Slowly the others

begin to wake up, frightened as the lights INTENSIFY.

The others slowly begin to retreat but Jasmine stands, staring

defiantly.  A smile creeps across her face as she sees that

the lights belong to...

TRANSPORT HELICOPTER

The Transport Helicopter touches down and Steve leaps out,

racing towards Jasmine.  Overwhelmed, Jasmine jumps into his

arms.

They kiss.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

The double doors burst open as the President carrying his

young daughter marches through.  Doctor ISAACS comes over to

them.

The President puts his daughter down as he sees...

PRESIDENT'S POV - MARGARET

Margaret lays in bed, doctors and nurses surrounding her.

Patricia rushes over.

Stunned, the President watches as Patricia hugs her mother.

Recovering, the President nods for the doctors to leave the

room.  As they begin to march out, he makes his way over to

his wife and daughter.

Patricia kisses her mother, says goodbye and leaves.  Out of

sight, Margaret winces, fading away.  The President grabs her

hand for support.  She squeezes tightly.

Margaret smiles at the man she knows all too well.

The look between them says more than any words.

INT. HALLWAY - OUTSIDE MARGARET'S ROOM - LATER

The President exits the room, overcome with emotion.

Constance, the doctors and some medical crew move to comfort

him.  He holds them off with a gesture.

He looks up and sees Jasmine, Steve and Dylan down the hall.

He pushes through the crowd and makes his way over to them.

Across the hall, Patricia sits in a chair, waiting.  Whitmore

walks over to her and kneels down next to his small child.

A GARBAGE CAN

Topples over with a BANG!  A foot steps in and starts kicking

trash all over.

EXT. AREA 51 - NIGHT

David is drunkenly knocking everything over, making a gigantic

mess.  Moishe comes up behind, restraining him.

David slips, falls on his ass, hard.  Moishe helps him back up

on his feet.

Slowly David looks up towards Moishe, an idea.

Sobered, David jumps kisses his father and bolts inside.

INT. STORAGE LAB - DAY

A large crowd has been gathered here at the lab.  General Grey

and Nimziki walk up to Constance.

Steve shows Dylan the alien space craft.

Steve loos up at the craft admiringly.

When the President enters a technician rushes over and knocks

on the hatch door on the alien attacker.  The door swings open

and David climbs down.

Grabbing a coke can from the "recycle" trash bin, David places

the empty can on top of the alien attacker.  David turns and

faces the gathering.

They do and David nods to a Technician inside the craft.  The

Technician disappears inside, closing the door behind him.  A

loud HUM emits from the craft.  David has to yell over it.

Mitchell shrugs affirmatively.  David gestures for him to try.

Taking aim, Mitchell SHOOTS.

The bullet RICOCHETS off the attacker's protective shield.

Several people in the crowd dock, afraid of being hit by the

errant bullet.

David walks over to his laptop, now connected directly to the

craft by cables and starts typing furiously.

David stops typing and stares at his wrist watch, silently

counting down.

Reluctantly Mitchell obliges.  This time the can is BLOWN OFF

THE CRAFT.  Everyone in the room is shocked.  The Technician

re-opens the craft's door and the loud HUM disappears.

The President is fascinated, he steps closer.  Moishe beams

proudly at his smart son.  Constance is amazed.

David turns his laptop around for the President to see.

David walks over to a diagram he's made showing the

relationship between the Mother Ship, the Space Crafts and the

smaller alien attackers.

David gestures to the alien attacker behind him.

Intrigued Steve turns and looks back at the alien attacker,

sizing it up.  David points to a satellite photo of the

underbelly of the Mother Ship.

Constance reacts, realizing David's participation in the plan.

Everyone turns to Steve who steps through the crowd.

of

David turns to the Technicians.

Technicians move to the large holding clamps on either side of

the craft.  With a loud CLANK, the clamps are pulled away.

For a moment the hulking craft TEETERS unevenly, but quickly

stabilizes, FLOATING ABOVE THEM.

Everyone stares at the floating ship with wonder.

INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Constance, General Grey and the President are walking down the

hall.  Nimziki rushes to catch up.

The President whirls, grabs Nimziki and SLAMS him against the

wall.  Holding him tight, the President gets in his face.

Constance is about to intervene when General Grey stops her.

The President releases him and turns to General Grey.

He storms off leaving everyone stunned.

INT. MILITARY TENT - CONTINUOUS

Four BRITISH AIR PILOTS are gathered around a table going over

a map.  One pilot, REGINALD, is in charge.

Suddenly the flap to the tent opens.  All the pilots draw

their pistols frightening the ARAB PILOT who stands in the

doorway.  The Arab Pilot speaks quickly in Arabic.

EXT. DRY LAKE - SECONDS LATER

As they step out of the tent we SEE more than a HUNDRED

FIGHTERS PLANES from different nations parked around them.

They've all gone into hiding out here in the desert, divided

into many smaller camps.

Reginald and Thomson follow their Arab cohort, walking through

the many other campsites.  Thomson gets some stares from the

IRAQI PILOTS.

Sure enough a campsite of ISRAELI PILOTS sits very near by.

ANGLE - ARABIAN AIR FORCE CAMP

Dozens of Arab pilots are gathered around a large radio as the

Morse code comes through.  Thomson quickly kneels down, taking

notes.

Striding in, the President surveys the war room.  General Grey

rushes over to meet him.

General Grey leads the President over to the wall map.

INT. BRENNON TRAILER - NIGHT

Troy is sleeping peacefully in his bed.  Russell sits at the

kitchen table as Miguel enters.

Russell holds up his bottle of Jack Daniels.  Clearly he's

been drinking again.  Miguel is crestfallen.  Pissed he turns

and storms out.

Drunkenly, Russell chases after him.

INT. AREA 51 - REFUGEE CAMP - CONTINUOUS

Making his way through the campers, Russell SEES a group of

refugees around some MILITARY OFFICERS who addresses them.

Russell wanders over towards them.

Russell pushes his way through the crowd.

The officer just stares at the bottle of Jack Daniels still in

his hand.

Russell gets into his face, desperate.

The Officers move on, taking a few volunteers with them.

Russell watches them go, dejected.  Angrily, he throws the

bottle of Jack, SMASHING it.

INT. STORAGE LAB - NIGHT

A large MISSILE slides back into a LAUNCHER that has been

attached to the top of the alien attacker.  Some workers PAINT

over the patch-work repairs.  Below, Mitchell briefs Steve and

David.

Mitchell takes a small black box from a table near by.

Steve dashes off as David moves toward the attacker.

Constance has been eavesdropping.  She walks to David.

David leans under the attacker where a TECHNICIAN is attaching

another device.

David turns and walks away, Constance following.

David stops, picking up a small trash can labelled "recycle."

David rushes off.  Constance watches him leave.

INT. SMALL GATHERING HALL - SAME

Jasmine is kneeling as Dylan tries to zip up the back of her

dress.

Jasmine stands, turns to Dylan.

She looks great.  But Dylan only gives her the "so-so" hand

gesture.

The door behind her flies open and Steve marches in.

Steve moves next to Jasmine, takes her hand.

As we REVERSE ANGLE we see that we are in a military CHAPEL, a

large crucifix on the wall.  A CHAPLAIN stands by the altar.

Steve pulls out the famous "dolphin" ring.

Just then the doors open and David and Constance enter taking

seats on opposing sides of the aisle.

Steve and Jasmine take their places at the altar.  Jasmine is

radiant.  Dylan rushes up and joins them.

As the ceremony begins, David and Constance share a pregnant

glance.  Slowly they reach across the aisle and hold hands as

Steve and Jasmine exchange their vows.

HANGAR DOORS - PRE-DAWN

Slowly spread apart revealing the myriad of different planes

that have been gathered.  Pilots, flights crews and refugees

prepare for the battle.

EXT. AREA 51 - TARMAC - PRE-DAWN

Walking out the President scans the motley collection of

planes; old, new, high-tech, low-tech.

Nodding in agreement, the President walks among the rank and

file.  Slowly they turn their attention to the President.

Constance, David and Moishe join the group, listening.  Even

David is moved.

The crowd erupts into applause and cheers.  The President

turns and walks over to an Officer holding a bundle of

clothes.  General Grey confronts the President as he begins to

disrobe.

General Grey wants to argue but can't.

INT. STORAGE LAB - SAME

Constance and David embrace as Steve turns to Dylan.

Jasmine hugs them both as Moishe walks over to David.

David looks down at the "barf bags" in Moishe's hand.

That means more to David than Moishe could have known.

Constance hugs David as Steve suddenly freaks out.

Steve is about to bolt when Moishe grabs him, retrieving two

cigars from his coat pocket.

Steve grabs them and climbs inside.  David smiles awkwardly,

then follows Steve.

INT. ALIEN ATTACKER - CONTINUOUS

The hatch shuts and David takes a seat next to Steve who hands

him one of the cigars.

Reluctantly David takes it.  As he does Steve notices the

"barf bag" on David's lap.  Off Steve's look...

Steve pulls back on the throttle but the attacker swings

BACKWARDS.

INT. STORAGE LAB - SAME

The Alien Attacker SMASHES BACKWARD into the rear of the lab.

Moishe winces as the others react fearfully.

INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ALIEN ATTACKER - SAME

Embarrassed, Steve adjusts the throttle.

Like a stick shift diagram of a car, a small hand written

"post it" card is pasted onto the dash.  Steve reaches over

and turns it upside down, righting the problem.

This time he pushes the throttle forward and the Attacker

JERKS ahead.

Shooting up into the ceiling shaft above, the Attacker ZOOMS

out of the underground laboratory.

INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - SAME

Slowly getting sick, David holds onto his "barf bag."

David nods sheepishly.  Steve's eyes go wide with wonder as

the ship climbs to the edge of our atmosphere.

The ship begins to SHAKE, rattling harshly as it climbs.

Through the window we SEE the blue sky EVAPORATE.  Slowly a

field of STARS take its place.

This is the moment Steve had wished for all his life.  He's

not disappointed.  David, however, is not so thrilled.

Hundreds of attackers are docked at each one.

In the center of the Landing are large BAY WINDOWS, inside is

Constance is KNOCKED back against the wall.  She activates the

elevator and the room begins to SINK.

As the hallway submerges, the entire hangar comes CRASHING

DOWN behind them.

INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

Over monitors the General observes the aerial battle.  This

room, too, ROCKS from the explosions.  The monitors FLICKER.

TIGHT.

David moves over to the computer to see if he can help.

Suddenly the large window slowly begins to DROP DOWN.

The blast shield continues to peel away.  David and Steve drop

down below the dash, hiding from view.  As the view becomes

unobstructed we SEE...

POV - THROUGH WINDOW - THE LANDING

Several Alien's looking across at us from the large bay

window of the Landing's control tower.

David leans from his hiding position and SEES several other

alien attackers are moving in on them.  They are

INT. AREA 51 - RESEARCH FACILITY - SAME

Like images from England during the blitzkrieg, the refugees

are huddled on the floor, the lights FLICKERING and the muted

sounds of distant EXPLOSIONS.  Miguel moves through the

refugees, searching for Russell.

A Yarmulke is unfolded.  As it is lifted we realize Moishe is

putting it on.  He holds the hands with the people around him

and begins to pray.  Nimziki moves next to Moishe.  Moishe

takes his hand.

ANGLE - PHILIP AND ALICIA

As another bomb rocks the room, Alicia moves closer to Philip.

Alicia smiles, a nice guy at last.

EXT. AREA 51 - SPACE SHIP - SAME

The City Destroyer space ship is settling just above the

compound as the American fighters circle it, chased by the

attackers.  Below the SCHISM begins to open!

INT. WAR ROOM - SAME

In all the commotion, no one notices as Miguel sneaks inside.

EXT. PRESIDENT'S PLANE - SAME

Taking the advice, the President DIVES.  He's met by two

flanking Fighters (EAGLES 9 & 2) as they cruise the underbelly

of the City Destroyer.  Sure enough, the SCHISM is opening,

preparing to fire the WALL OF DESTRUCTION.

The President locks the SCHISM hatchway into the center of his

HUD (heads up display).  Just as he FIRES, Eagle 9 is BLOWN

OUT OF THE SKY.  It rocks the President, sending his missile

off target.

Off balance, the missile hits just wide of the hatchway and

EXPLODES, rocking the entire ship.

But before he can target, his fighter EXPLODES.

The lights continue to flicker.  Jasmine grabs onto Dylan and

Patricia, holding them tight.

him.  A light on it flashes ARMED.

Hearing his voice, Miguel is shocked.  He moves closer towards

the monitors.

The remaining fighters lay down COVER FIRE for Russell's old

bi-wing.  Russell heads directly TOWARDS THE SCHISM.

Everyone is gripped to the screen as we see it get closer and

closer to the closing bay doors.  Miguel is aghast.

Miguel races over to the microphone, attempts to grab it.

EXT. CITY DESTROYER - SCHISM - SAME

Russell nears the SCHISM, a hail of alien firepower erupting

around him.

Russell smiles at b being called "Dad."

Russell turns off his radio as he banks UPWARD towards the

open SCHISM.  The climb is steep, and the bi-wing nearly

stalls out.

Suddenly the bright lights VANISH and the beam begins to form.

Russell's bi-wing just makes it INSIDE THE OPEN SCHISM and

disappears from view.

The President and remaining fighters BANK AWAY, clearing.

Suddenly, A GIGANTIC EXPLOSION, RIPS THROUGH THE CENTER OF THE

SPACE CRAFT.  It's causing a CHAIN REACTION of explosion.

Teetering, the entire space ship, turns away out of control.

The room erupts in CHEERS.  Everyone, that is, except Miguel.

They share a quick sober laugh.

Steve lights his cigar, then lights David's.

EXT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ALIEN ATTACKER - SAME

Popping up from behind the dash, cigars in their mouths, Steve

and David start waving "good-bye" like idiots.

The Aliens in the tower don't know how to react.  The

attackers move in for the kill.

INT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - SAME

He reaches down to the black box we saw before and enters the

launch code.

EXT. STEVE AND DAVID'S ATTACKER - SAME

Suddenly the missile ERUPTS from behind the manifold and

BLASTS into the control tower, SHATTERING THE GLASS WINDOW.

INT. CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The missile SMASHES through the glass.  The atmosphere

impeached, the aliens quickly succumb to the elements, chocking

and dying.

The missile BLASTS by WRECKING equipment until it LODGES into

the back wall of the Landing tower.

A small counter on the missile begins to count down 30:00,

29:00, 28:00...

We get the feeling the Alien knows what's coming.

Steve and David's attacker just reaches the doorway as the

center of the landing EXPLODES behind them.

The enormous impact, rocks some of the lagging attackers off

track.

Just as the last of them exit the docking bay, a HUGE FIREBALL

erupts behind them ripping through the Mother Ship.

ANGLE - FARTHER AWAY

ZOOMING towards us, Steve guides his ship away.  The Alien

attackers in hot pursuit.  Behind them we SEE the ENTIRE

MOTHER SHIP EXPLODE.

The immense EXPLOSION GROWS OUTWARDS coming right at us.  The

ATTACKERS are GOBBLED UP as the EXPLOSION WIDENS.  Quickly the

explosion gains ground on Steve and David.

ANGLE - STEVE AND DAVID'S SHIP

Like a loose board caught in the surf, Steve and David's ship

rides the edge of the explosion, getting knocked END OVER END.

Tumbling ass over tea kettle, David and Steve are ROCKED in

The President is climbing out as General Grey rushes to his

aid.  Behind him, Jasmine leads Dylan and Patricia, who breaks

free and RUSHES to her father.  The President sweeps her up in

his arms as Jasmine approaches.

Behind her, Constance rushes over, the same thing on her mind.

Before he can answer they HEAR a ROAR above.  They all become

silent as they turn and look to the skies.

ANGLE - BLUE SKIES - FIREBALL

The FIREBALL COMET is rapidly shooting down towards us.

Suddenly BURSTING OUT OF THE FLAMES, Steve and David's ship

DARTS DOWN.

Just over the heads of the cheering crowds, Steve and David's

ship ZOOMS overhead, disappearing out of sight.

Several army JEEPS race across the arid desert floor.  As they

WHIP past we see they are headed towards a gigantic BLACK

PLUME OF SMOKE in the distance.

The Jeeps SKID to a halt.  Jasmine and Constance are the first

She hugs him.  They kiss.

atmosphere like thousands of SHOOTING STARS.  It's an

incredible sight.

Everyone stares in wonder at the beautiful lights.
