In the SHADOWS the agitated WOMEN of the VILLAGE start rocking and

wailing in unison.

pulls ANN close to him, trying to protect her. ANN is wrenched

from him ...

She struggles against her captors ...

her gaze fixed on ANN, muttering curses, eyes burning with a dark

fury ...

CLOSING IN on the BRONTOSAURUS HERD! A CARNOTAUR leaps onto the

back of a FLEEING BRONTOSAUR, causing it to falter and slide

against the cliff. TWO MORE CARNOTAURS leap onto the ailing

BRONTOSAUR as the rest of the pack stream past.

DENHAM, JACK and the OTHERS are running as fast as they can ...

JACK glances over his shoulder - the WALL of THUNDERING BRONTOSAUR

LEGS are about to ENGULF THEM!

A

HUGE LEGS - like wildly pounding Redwood tree trunks! The

CARNOTAURS are snapping and snarling at the LEGS ... they see the

MEN! Their only hope of survival is to stay WITHIN THE STAMPEDE,

out of reach of the MEATEATERS!

QUICK IMAGES: THE GROUP in the SEA of LEGS ... a SAILOR trips and

is CRUSHED UNDERFOOT. A COUPLE OF SAILORS jump clear of the

BRONTOSAURS - only to be set on by the CARNOTAURS. JACK ... DENHAM

... SAILORS ... everyone is running madly, dodging BRONTOSAURS,

CARNOTAURS and trying not to fall!

A CARNOTAUR focuses on JACK ... it skillfully weaves IN BETWEEN

and UNDER the BRONTOSAURS and emerges right behind JACK, it's

SNAPPING JAWS inches away from his head!

SIDEWAYS - under a BRONTOSAUR'S LEGS. The CARNOTAUR is instantly

trampled!

BRUCE is managing to stay ahead of the stampede - possibly RUNNING

FASTER than any human before him! A CARNOTAUR races out in front

of the stampede and bears down on BRUCE with incredible speed!

BRUCE desperately waves a TOMMY GUN at the CARNOTAUR ... TOWARDS

THE STAMPEDE!

JACK sees it coming ...

BRUCE FIRES, missing the CARNOTAUR ...

... but he hits the LEAD BRONTOSAUR, following behind, in the

chest. The BRONTOSAUR COLLAPSES AT TOP SPEED! It CARTWHEELS OVER,

it's huge NECK and TAIL thrashing out. The OTHER BRONTOSAURS

PLOUGH INTO IT, tripping and rolling!

JACK and the SAILORS suddenly find themselves in the middle of an

amazing FLESHY FREIGHT TRAIN PILE-UP! SAILORS are crushed as

BRONTOSAURS come down on top of them! A CARNOTAUR is squashed when

TWO BRONTOSAURS slam together.

JACK rolls against a rock as MOUNTAINS of BRONTOSAUR TUMBLE all

around him.

DENHAM throws himself onto the ground, shielding the CAMERA.

to a VAST PILE of DEAD or WOUNDED ANIMALS ... The CARNOTAURS

immediately go to work, leaping onto BRONTOSAURS, ripping into

fleshy stomachs.

J

staggers out of the DINOSAUR PILE-UP ... he turns back at the

SOUND OF LOUD HISSING - a CARNOTAURUS is climbing over a DEAD

BRONTOSAUR, it's gleaming eyes intent on JACK. The CARNOTAURUS

leaps ...

BAM! BAM! BAM! The CARNOTAURUS is riddled with BULLETS and falls

DEAD at JACK'S FEET!

HAYES hurries towards JACK, clutching his TOMMY GUN!

HAYES sends the rest of the MEN up a steep ROCKY SLOPE ... they

SLIP and SLIDE on the SLIMY MOSS-COVERED ROCKS.

JACK doesn't move. He looks around in mounting panic.

DENHAM limps out of the PILE-UP, bloodied and covered in DUST -

the CAMERA in his arms.

HAYES blasts at another CARNOTAURUS - it TOPPLES BACKWARDS.

EXT. SLIMY SLOPE - DAY

The GROUP are desperately scrambling up the STEEP ROCKY SLOPE -

slipping and sliding on the WET MOSS ... FOUR SURVIVING CARNOTAURS

follow in pursuit ... the MEN start sliding backwards in their

panic. The CARNOTAURS are sliding too, but their powerful legs are

working furiously, propelling them closer and closer to the

flailing SAILORS!

A SAILOR loses his footing completely ... he rolls past TWO

CARNOTAURS before being grabbed by the JAWS of the THIRD.

The MEN grab hold of WEEDS, ROCKS ... ANYTHING, to get away from

the DINOSAURS. They are crawling towards a network of NARROW

FISSURES between HUGE ROCKS ... which the CARNOTAURS cannot

squeeze through.

ANGLE ON: HERB is scrabbling up as best as he can with his bad leg

... DENHAM moves towards him, reaching desperately ...

HERB is straining to hold the TRIPOD when his GAMMY LEG gives way

... he SLIPS and ROLLS into the path of an oncoming CARNOTAUR!

CLOSE ON: DENHAM reacting in SHOCK as HERB is KILLED by the

frenzying CARNOTAURS.

EXT. EDGE OF SWAMP - DAY

down a JAGGED ROCK face into lush sub-tropical VEGETATION. They

are followed by a few surviving SAILORS - a bedraggled GROUP ...

CUT, BRUISED, COVERED in DUST, SOAKED in SWEAT. Most of the GUNS

are lost.

They are on a NARROW CLEARING at the edge of a MISTY SWAMP. SHEER

CLIFFS rise out of the SWAMP on both sides of the SHORE.

CLOSE ON: DENHAM reaches with a trembling hand for his HIP FLASK.

He takes a big SWIG ... and stands staring out over the SWAMP.

PRESTON sits on A TREE STUMP nearby.

CLOSE ON: DENHAM reaching for that moment of self justification.

CLOSE ON: PRESTON, he has heard this all before.

WIDE ON: BRUCE stands amongst the SEATED SAILORS.

BRUCE becomes aware of JACK staring at him COLDLY. BRUCE self

consciously clears his THROAT.

BRUCE walks off. HAYES turns to the rest of the GROUP.

A couple of SAILORS shuffle forward towards BRUCE.

EXT. JUNGLE RUINS - DAY

WIDE ON: KONG SITS on the EDGE of a RUIN, surveying the JUNGLE.

He SITS with his BACK to ANN, in the crumbling remains of an

enclosed ENTRY AREA ... which also provides the only way out.

ANGLE ON: ANN, having feigned unconsciousness, she now cautiously

searches for a way to escape.

C

WALLS are TOO STEEP to attempt an escape ...

... but there is a NARROW STAIRWAY across the COURTYARD, leading

down into the JUNGLE.

INCH by INCH ANN starts to EDGE FORWARD, CRAWLING on her STOMACH

towards the STAIRS. KONG is CHEWING NOISILY ... he SHIFTS HIS

WEIGHT, half turning ... ANN FREEZES.

doesn't appear to notice she's moved several feet. He continues

EATING ...

ANN again starts to EDGE FORWARD ... she is STARTLED when some

CREEPY INSECTS swarm out of a CRACK in the FLAGSTONES, inches from

her FACE!

With only a few feet left to go, ANN quietly rises and scurries

towards the STAIRWAY. She clambers into the NARROW PASSAGE -

finally out of KONG'S SIGHT! Glancing back over her shoulder, ANN

hurries down the STAIRWAY towards FREEDOM!

EXT. BOTTOM OF STAIRWAY/JUNGLE - DAY

ANN pauses at the BOTTOM of the STAIRS, listening for sounds of

KONG. All is QUIET ... she glances back up the stairs ... no sign

of him there ...

... gathering all her strength ANN emerges from the PASSAGE and

makes a bold run across the CLEARING towards the cover of the

JUNGLE!

THUD! KONG'S FIST SLAMS DOWN in FRONT of ANN!

She GASPS and tries to change direction ... THUD! Another FIST

blocks her way. KONG GROWLS ANGRILY!

ANN swings around and FACES KONG ... he SNARLS at HER, FURIOUS and

DEADLY.

she TRIPS and FALLS!

CLOSE ON: ANN, flat on the ground, eyes shut, lying still.

ANGLE ON: KONG .. circling around ANN, SUSPICIOUS. He PRODS her a

couple of times ...no response. KONG moves on ... ANN'S EYES flick

OPEN! At that moment KONG doubles back - CATCHING her out!

... ANN SPRINGS UP, looks at KONG for a desperate moment, wonders

if she should run, decides she'll never make it ... and takes

another PRATFALL!!

KONG cocks his HEAD! He GRIMACES, baring his teeth and CIRCLES

her.

ANN repeats the COMIC FALL! KONG SLAPS his HANDS on the GROUND,

SHAKES his HEAD and GROWLS.

ANN starts to draw upon her VAUDEVILLE ROUTINE, swaying drunkenly

and falling, then bouncing back up ... working her timing around

KONG'S reactions - he grows increasingly ENGAGED.

down her face. Her EYES dart between the JUNGLE and KONG, she's

looking for her chance ...

... but KONG is a DEMANDING audience. He wants more ... he wants

ANN to fall down again.

KONG PRODS ANN ROUGHLY, knocking her OFF HER FEET. She FALLS to

the GROUND ... WINDED.

KONG slaps his hands on the GROUND, and lets out another EXCITED

GROWL. He thumps the GROUND with his FISTS, and SHAKES his HEAD,

delighted with the GAME.

ANN tries to get up - KONG pushes her over again! This time she

stays on the GROUND, breathing HEAVILY.

KONG cocks his HEAD ... he THUMPS his FISTS on the GROUND.

KONG RISES TO HIS FEET, and BEATS his CHEST, towering over ANN.

His HUGE FIST rises into the air and comes SLAMMING DOWN straight

TOWARDS ANN!

CLOSE ON: ANN shuts her eyes ... KONG'S FIST THUDS into the ground

inches away from her.

THUD! Another FIST SLAMS into the GROUND!

ANGLE ON: KONG ROARS and beats his chest in a dramatic display of

ANGER and FRUSTRATION. He rips a TREE from the ground as his ANGER

spirals into violent MADNESS.

In this moment an UNFAMILIAR feeling wells inside him ... a half

formed emotion he hasn't experienced much in his long life: he

feels a connection to this tiny creature.

The SPARK of RAGE goes out in KONG'S EYES ...

KONG stares at ANN as a confusion of feelings wash over him.

knows only that she has somehow disarmed him ... and this has in

turn, DIMINISHED his power.

KONG starts to BACK AWAY from ANN - slowly at first, until DOUBT

and FEAR compel him to move faster. Suddenly he turns away.

ANN watches as KONG lopes off. He pulls himself up and over a

RUINED WALL and DISAPPEARS from SIGHT.

ANGLE ON: ANN, rising to her feet, finally free of her captor.

EXT. LOG CHASM - DAY

WEAK SUNLIGHT filters through the DARK CANOPY above casting a

SICKLY GREEN HUE over the place.

SLIMY, MOSS covered LOG ... the going is treacherous.

ANGLE ON: DENHAM struggling with the CAMERA ... JACK follows HAYES

... LUMPY helps CHOY. They put one foot in front of the other,

trying not to let the DROP unnerve them.

ANGLE ON: HAYES suddenly stops ... tensely scanning the DARK RUINS

on the other side of the CHASM ...

CREEPY POV: ... something is watching the MEN on the LOG.

HAYES motions for JIMMY to be quiet. He stares intently into    the

DARKNESS of the FOREBODING RUINS.

HAYES turns and looks at JIMMY.

CLOSE ON: JIMMY looking at HAYES uneasily, as he continues across

the LOG.

towards HAYES.

The GROUP on the LOG FREEZE, start to BACK AWAY, slipping and

sliding on the WET MOSS.

ANGLE ON: HAYES... SHOOTS into the DARKNESS of the TUNNEL.

KONG rampages out of the TUNNEL MOUTH! He SNATCHES HAYES with one

SWEEP of his HAND.

CLOSE ON: HAYES in KONG's HAND ...

SLOWLY HAYES begins to lift his PISTOL up ... KONG's GAZE locks

back on HAYES ...

KONG stares at HAYES a BEAT ... HAYES suddenly raises his PISTOL

at KONG to shoot!

ANGLE ON: KONG HURLS HAYES at the SAILORS ... he flies over their

heads like RAG-DOLL and smashes against the FAR WALL of the RAVINE

with a sickening CRUNCH.

JIMMY runs at KONG, blinded by tears of GRIEF and RAGE ... JACK

KNOCKS him down and SHOOTS at KONG.

WILD SHOOTING from the SAILORS, as they try to maintain BALANCE on

the LOG.

KONG ROARS ... DESPERATE SAILORS try to back across the RAVINE.

KONG runs towards the LOG ... KONG'S FIST smashes at the LOG,

KONG ROARS with FRUSTRATION, and TOSSES the ENTIRE LOG into the

CHASM!

LOG as it FALLS!

QUICK IMAGE: PRESTON thrown off the LOG halfway down ... he

manages to GRAB onto a ROCKY SHELF.

ANGLE ON: PRESTON is nearest to the FAR BANK ... he LEAPS, and

MANAGES to catch hold of some hanging VINES, hauling himself up to

safety.

ANGLE ON: The LOG plummets into a web of VINES, which arrest its

FALL and sends it FLIPPING end on end, throwing the MEN CLEAR into

mid-air... DENHAM, JACK and LUMPY land in SOFT MUD which cushions

the impact of the LANDING.

EXT. VALLEY EDGE - DAY

ANN suddenly spins around ... the DISTANT SOUND of approaching

FOOTSTEPS through the dense JUNGLE. A flicker of hope in ANN'S

eyes! She starts hurrying towards the FOOTSTEPS!

CLOSE ON: ANN sees a distant PLUME of SMOKE - over FOUR MILES AWAY

... she hesitates.

She SLOWLY turns towards the SOUND of the FOOTSTEPS, which are now

VERY CLOSE. Suddenly a LARGE 8 foot tall CARNIVOROUS DINOSAUR is

in the GLADE before her!

WIDE TREE.

SUDDENLY ... ANN sees the LEGS of one of her pursuers LIFT off the

GROUND - it's taloned feet thrashing in mid-air.

forced to watch the twitching legs SHUDDER and FLAIL.

The SOUND of BONE CRUNCHING ... CRACK! The CARNIVORE'S LEGS SPASM

ANN is completely still, she dare not breathe ... whatever killed

the CARNIVORE is now inches from her hiding PLACE.

CLOSE ON: ANN'S FACE ... as she sees something CRAWLING above her.

CLOSE ON: A DARK HOLE, beneath the tree ... Long FEELERS probe

along the ROOF of the hole as a HUGE CENTIPEDE CRAWLS towards her.

ANN doesn't move as it inches towards her face. Suddenly she feels

another crawling up over her shoulder.

ANN FREAKS! She desperately scrambles away from the CENTIPEDES ...

rolls out on the OTHER SIDE of the TREE and stands to RUN...

... TOWERING above her, with the DEAD CARNIVORE hanging limply

from it's HUGE JAWS, is a TYRANNOSAURUS REX!

ANN starts RUNNING! The TYRANNOSAUR crashes after her with the

DEAD CARNIVORE still in it's MOUTH... as SHE races through the

JUNGLE, dodging TREES, leaping over FALLEN LOGS, smashing through

BUSHES, the TYRANNOSAUR POUNDING ever closer in pursuit. ANN can

feel its hot sour BREATH blowing on the back of her neck! The HUGE

JAWS of the HUGE BEAST open INCHES from ANN'S HEAD!

CRASHES NOISILY through a THICKET of PALMS ...

EXT. FALLEN TREE GLADE - DAY

ANGLE ON: ANN'S LUNGS are bursting, but the TYRANNOSAUR is   GAINING

on her ... she manages to scramble onto a FALLEN TREE that   juts

out over a small CLIFF. ANN clings onto the MOSSY LOG, and   crawls

towards the END ... the TYRANNOSAUR cannot possibly follow   her.

She falls amongst the roots, lying as flat as possible, praying

the TYRANNOSAUR doesn't see her. It seems to work and IT walks

off. ANN HESITANTLY SITS up, thinking that she is at last free,

only to turn and discover another is behind her!

With an almost delicate movement, the TYRANNOSAUR nudges the LOG

with it's head ... causing it to lurch dramatically! The

TYRANNOSAUR pushes HARDER, sending ANN over the SIDE ...

she just manages to grab hold of a BRANCH as she FALLS. ANN hangs

on desperately ...

SHE SCREAMS!

ANN is HELPLESS ... The TYRANNOSAUR positions it's HEAD for the

FINAL LUNGE - gaping JAWS OPEN impossibly WIDE ...

AT THAT MOMENT: KONG CHARGES!

KONG meets the TYRANNOSAUR HEAD-ON at FULL SPEED! He swings, with

his FOOT smashing the TYRANNOSAUR against the FALLEN LOG ... ANN

loses her GRASP and FALLS ... as the DINOSAUR SPRAWLS onto the

ground beside her ... in a flash, KONG CATCHES HER mid-fall ...

ROLLING AWAY as the TYRANNOSAUR LEAPS UP and tries to take another

swipe.

TYRANNOSAURS SPRAWLING TO THE GROUND. The FIRST TYRANNOSAUR

scrambles back to it's feet! KONG holds ANN protectively as he

braces himself for the FIGHT OF HIS LIFE. The TWO TYRANNOSAURS

CIRCLE him ... when SUDDENLY! A THIRD TYRANNOSAUR comes from

behind.

T

KONG fights like a madman on three separate fronts ... Not only

does he have to do battle with the TYRANNOSAURS, he is also

PROTECTING ANN - constantly transferring her from ONE HAND to THE

OTHER as the TYRANNOSAURS SNAP AT HER HEELS.

KONG punches and smashes with his fists, but he also uses

wrestling-style headlocks and flips ... for a brief moment, ANN

rolls free on the ground and has to dodge 25-foot DINOSAURS and

the GORILLA, as the frenzied fight THUNDERS all around her.

The FIRST TYRANNOSAUR is taken out when KONG LIFTS up a HUGE

BOULDER and SMASHES it against the TYRANNOSAUR'S HEAD.

KONG and the TWO TYRANNOSAURS slide down on to a ROCKY OUTCROP.

KONG outs the SECOND TYRANNOSAUR in a HEADLOCK, FLIPPING it over

his shoulder, and throwing it down into the CHASM. CLINGING ONTO

THE LEDGE KONG PULLS THE FIRST TYRANNOSAUR OFF THE LEDGE ... BUT

AS IT FALLS it SNAPS AT KONG'S FOOT.

E

KONG ROARS IN PAIN AND TOGETHER THEY FALL DOWN INTO THE CHASM ...

DOWN INTO THE VINES. KONG CONTINUES TO FIGHT THE TYRANNOSAUR, AS

ANN IS LEFT SWINGING, CAUGHT UP IN THE VINES ... TOWARDS THE

SECOND TYRANNOSAUR. HE SNAPS AT HER AS SHE COMES WITHIN INCHES OF

HIS JAW.

WIDE ON: KONG SEES AND CLIMBS UP TOWARDS IT, PULLING IT DOWN.

THEY ALL TUMBLE DEEPER INTO THE CHASM, AND SUDDENLY ANN FINDS

HERSELF DANGLING FROM THE JAWS OF THE TYRANNOSAUR ABOVE THE JAWS

OF ANOTHER! KONG SWINGS AND KICKS THE TYRANNOSAUR IN THE HEAD ...

ANN LOSES HER GRIP AND PLUMMETS DOWN ... VINES BREAKING AS SHE

FALLS. AND more SMASHING AGAINST THE CHASM WALLS ... SHE FALLS AND

LANDS ON THE HEAD OF ANOTHER. FALLS AGAIN. SHE LANDS IN THE SWAMP.

RUNS. IT CHASES.

EXT. CLEARING - DAY

WIDE ON: ANN faces the TYRANNOSAUR! SUDDENLY KONG THUDS DOWN

BEHIND HER ... GLARING AT THE DINOSAUR ... ANN FINDS HERSELF

CAUGHT BETWEEN THE TWO BEASTS. ANN WEIGHS UP HER OPTIONS BETWEEN

BOTH ... and for a moment ANN & KONG LOCK EYES. SHE THEN BACKS

BENEATH THE LOOMING FIGURE OF KONG.

T

ANN GENTLY to the side as HE and the TYRANNOSAUR LUNGE at each

other.

KONG GRABS HIS JAWS in BOTH HANDS forcing it OPEN and BITING the

TYRANNOSAUR'S TONGUE. HE ROLLS the TYRANNOSAUR over and over,

using all his strength to force the TYRANNOSAUR'S JAWS OPEN

before RIPPING them clean APART at the HINGE! The TYRANNOSAUR

sprawls back, DEAD.

KONG is PANTING HEAVILY ... he has been BITTEN, RAKED and CUT.    He

puts his foot on the LAST TYRANNOSAUR and BEATS HIS CHEST,

TRIUMPHANTLY with a DEAFENING ROAR.

WIDE ON: KONG KICKS THE DINOSAUR OUT THE WAY. KONG ROARS ANGRILY -

his blood is up, he is ready to take on the world. HE STANDS NEXT

TO ANN, BUT HE WON'T LOOK AT HER DIRECTLY. SHE TRIES TO HIS

ATTENTION BUT HE LOOKS AWAY. HE LUMBERS AWAY. KONG has DEADLY

INTENT in his EYES. ANN watches as he DISAPPEARS into the JUNGLE.

ANGLE ON: ANN, CONFUSED for a minute ... THEN RUNS AFTER HIM.

ANGLE ON: ANN is roughly SWUNG into the air, as KONG bounds off

into the DEEP JUNGLE INTERIOR.

ANN as she is suddenly SNATCHED UP by KONG and SWUNG ROUGHLY on to

his SHOULDER.

CLOSE ON: ANN HANGS ON for dear life as KONG GALLOPS into the

JUNGLE.

KONG moves SWIFTLY and POWERFULLY through the JUNGLE with ANN on

his SHOULDER ...

ANGLE ON: ANN as she looks up at the GIANT GORILLA ... the

tension seems to go out of her body, she relaxes into his HAND

... for the first time since coming to SKULL ISLAND she feels

SAFE.

EXT. BOTTOM OF CHASM - DAY

CLOSE ON: JACK STIRRING, immediately hearing the SCUTTLE OF

INSECTS. HE ROLLS OVER and see's HUGE SPIDERS CRAWLING INTO THE

PIT. HE staggers to his FEET ... REACHING INTO HIS PACK and PULLS

DENHAM is lying nearby.

DENHAM STIRS, MUMBLING IN PAIN BUT ALIVE.

JACK SEES JIMMY.

ANGLE ON: DENHAM PEERING over a ROCK. The wreckage of the CAMERA

lies smashed and broken on the CHASM floor ... a thin, shiny,

thread of black FILM trailing from the smashed CAMERA body like

spilt innards.

DENHAM reaches out and touches the EXPOSED FILM ... his dreams

DESTROYED.

WIDE ON: THE FLARE SLOWLY DIES.

CLOSE ON: JACK cradling JIMMY in his ARMS. HE LOOKS UP as he SEES

the INSECTS CRAWL BACK.

ANGLE ON: a HUGE six-foot CARNIVOROUS MAGGOT-THING squirms out!

It crawls blindly towards LUMPY and CHOY!

ANGLE ON: LUMPY pulling CHOY'S BODY to safety, but both are

ATTACKED by LARGE INSECTS, the size of dogs!

JACK tries to PULL THE GIANT CRAB-SPIDER OFF LUMPY, but instead it

TURNS on him! More GIANT CRAB-SPIDERS JUMP at JACK.

LUMPY and CHOY are CONSUMED by the nightmarish BUGS.

ANGLE ON: DENHAM is WIELDING a short stick like a CLUB ... he

smashes the HUGE BUGS in a psychotic explosion of RAGE,

pulverizing their bodies into the DIRT!

All around, MONSTROSITIES OF NATURE emerge from DANK BURROWS and

crawl towards the JACK, DENHAM and JIMMY ... these are HUGE

INSECTILE MUTANTS - combinations of SPIDERS, CRABS, MANTISES and

CENTIPEDES!

SUDDENLY JIMMY notices the TOMMY GUN sticking out of JACK'S PACK.

GRABBING IT he aims at the INSECTS on JACK.

BAM! BAM! BAM! The GIANT INSECTS are blown apart!

JACK looks wildly around for DENHAM. THEY SEE that they're

SURROUNDED BY SPIDERS. ANGLE ON: JACK desperately swings at the

INSECTS with a STICK, whacking and stabbing them.

BAM! BAM! BAM! GUNSHOTS RING OUT. SPIDERS SWARM out of HOLES in

EXT. JUNGLE - DAY

Moving purposefully along a well-known route to his LAIR, KONG

launches himself across a LOW CHASM ... one hand reaching out

to clutch at THICK VINES on the other side ...

SUDDENLY! The THICK VINES TEAR AWAY from the side of the CHASM

WALL ... KONG falls backwards. ANN still clutched protectively

to his CHEST he lands with a THUD!

ANN looks up alarmed!

KONG scrambles to his feet, GROWLING ... he places ANN on the

GROUND pushing her protectively behind him.

KONG POV: LOOMING out of the CHASM WALL is a HUGE FACE!

CLOSE ON: ANN as her expression suddenly changes from FEAR to

DAWNING COMPREHENSION.

ANN walks past KONG ... who emits another LOW, WARNING GROWL.

ANN reaches the WALL and begins to pull away more of the VINES

and CREEPERS to reveal ...

A life-size and very life-like eroded STATUE of a SITTING

GIANT GORILLA ... the IMAGE of KONG ...

ANN turns back excitedly to KONG, trying to make him understand.

KONG looks from ANN to the HUGE STATUE ...

KONG POV: ANN is dwarfed by the STONE MONOLITH.

PUSH IN on KONG ... a growing sense of REALISATION as he comes to

understand the STATUE is in fact a reflection of himself.

CLOSE ON: KONG looking down at his hands ... it's as if he is

seeing his GNARLED, LEATHERY FINGERS for the first time.

ANN moves towards KONG ... he looks at her ... there is a

VULNERABLE EXPRESSION on his FACE ... FEAR and SADNESS well in his

EYES.

EXT. SKULL MOUNTAIN - DUSK

In VERTIGO-INDUCING shots, KONG climbs HIGHER and HIGHER - up into

the HIGHEST PEAK of SKULL ISLAND ... carefully cradling ANN in his

hand.

A sudden FLAP OF WINGS and FLICKERING SHADOW causes KONG to pull

ANN close to his chest as a sinister BAT-TYPE CREATURE lunges at

her ... these SCAVENGERS hover in the SKIES around SKULL MOUNTAIN

are more reptile than bat.

juts out high over SKULL ISLAND ...

This is KONG'S LAIR ... Over the ledge is a DIZZYING DROP of at

least 1000-feet down to the JUNGLE.

The "VENTURE" can be seen - moored off the TIP of the ISLAND, some

three miles away.

he moves away and sits to one side of the LEDGE.

The SKY is a FIERY ORANGE as the SUN goes down ...   SILHOUETTING

the FIGURE of KONG ...

CLOSE ON: ANN looks around the CAVE taking in her STRANGE

SURROUNDINGS ... her eyes fall upon a HUGE GORILLA SKULL and

SKELETON which lie within the recesses of the CAVE ...

ANN turns and looks back at KONG ... realizing these are the BONES

of his FOREBEARS ... that KONG was not always alone.

SOUND, sends ANN scurrying towards KONG ...

ANN breaks into a few tap steps ... NO RESPONSE. She leans   down

and picks up some STONES ... JUGGLING them, attempting to amuse

him as she did before. KONG's gaze remains averted ...

He looks out over the JUNGLE CANOPY. ANN follows his GAZE, taking

in the RUGGED LANDSCAPE which is bathed in the last EVENING RAYS

of the SUN. She stares out to sea, a RAIN CLOUD casts shadows over

the OCEAN.

KONG sits QUIETLY staring out over the JUNGLE ... she looks up at

him.

ANN places her HAND against her heart.

KONG'S BIG PAW unfurls beside ANN ... she hesitates for a moment,

then CLIMBS into it.

BUILDING rises from the MIDTOWN area like a giant solitary finger,

reaching for the heavens.

WIDE SHOT ... KONG climbing the EMPIRE STATE BUILDING, silhouetted

against the LIGHTENING SKY.

LOOKING DOWN ... ANN clings to KONG'S SHOULDER, a DIZZYING 1000

foot drop to the street below.

KONG climbs onto the OBSERVATION DECK of the EMPIRE STATE

BUILDING. He gently places ANN down ... a CHILL WIND catches at

her DRESS. ANN looks up at KONG ... BLOOD slowly seeps from his

numerous WOUNDS ...

KONG sits still, staring out across the CITY ...

To the EAST the sun is rising, casting an soft glow over

buildings ... glinting off the WATERS of the EAST...

...

CLOSE ON: ANN, she understands ...

Here, high above the squalor and the noise and confusion, the city

lies quiet, almost peaceful ...

WIDER ... KONG cradles ANN in his HAND as they SHARE the moment.

WIDE ON: KONG and ANN sit on the LEDGE, watching the SUN RISE.

SIX NAVAL BIPLANES suddenly ROAR INTO SHOT, sweeping low over the

DOWNTOWN BUSINESS DISTRICT ... and closing in on KONG. These are

TWO-SEATERS, armed with TWIN MACHINE-GUNS for the PILOT, and a

flexible MACHINE-GUN for the OBSERVER.

CLOSE ON: PILOT'S FINGER on trigger.

A COLD WIND blows ANN'S hair as she watches the PLANES approach.

KONG is UNEASY about these BUZZING PREDATORS as they CIRCLE above

him.

The NAVAL PLANES peel off into an ATTACKING DIVE at KONG.

DOWN GUN-SIGHTS ... drifting left and right as KONG grows in size

... LOCKED ON!

KONG is suddenly FEARFUL ... he INSTINCTIVELY pushes ANN towards

the BUILDING'S WALL!

The PLANES split to either side of KONG, ZOOMING straight at him!

KONG ROARS at the PLANES, as if issuing a CHALLENGE.

ANN is screaming ...

THE SIX NAVAL PLANES fly at KONG from different directions!

MACHINE-GUNS START FIRING!

KONG ROARS ... and SNATCHES at the NAVAL PLANES as they ZOOM by

... he FLINCHES as he is HIT BY BULLETS!

KONG clambers onto the SIDE of the BUILDING and begins climbing

to the UPPER MOST LEVEL...attempting to DRAW the PLANES away from

ANN ...

bullets attack KONG.

ANGLE ON: ANN continues to climb the ladder, SHE is nearing the

SUDDENLY a PLANE FLIES straight at KONG. He LEAPS out the way and

FALLS...

KONG smashes into the SIDE of the BUILDING ... one hand still

grasping onto the UPPER LEVEL ... the TOP of ANN'S LADDER gives

way ...

HIGH ANGLE ON: ANN dangling precariously in mid-air as she

desperately tries to hold on to the STEEL RUNGS ... her fingers

slip ... ANN FALLS!

KONG stretches out and catches ANN in his HUGE PAW ... behind him

the planes are circling preparing to dive once again ...

KONG reaches through the BROKEN WINDOWS and puts ANN in the GLASS-

IN UPPER-OBSERVATION DECK ... ANN tumbles to the GROUND.

Before she can stand another BURST of GUNFIRE rakes the BUILDING!

WINDOWS SHATTER! GLASS FLIES all around ANN. BULLETS SLAM into the

BACK of KONG!

KONG circles the building trying to get away from the PLANE but it

continues to follow him.

frantically waves at the PLANES, screaming as loud as she can!

CLOSE ON: THE PILOT ... seeing ANN, he decides not to fire.

ANGLE ON: KONG, now barely clinging to the top of the building,

gently picks up ANN and STARES AT HER ONE LAST TIME. HE places her

GENTLY down on the ground ...

GUNFIRE SMASHES into KONG. ANN looks up ... KONG grasps the side

of the BUILDING ... She crawls over to him, clutches his FINGERS,

hugging them, trying to COMFORT HIM. TEARS STREAM DOWN HER FACE

by a sense of utter despair ...

CLOSE ON: ANN ... for a brief moment she wants to do nothing

more than follow KONG ...

ANGLE ON: JACK as he climbs on to the ROOF ... he looks at ANN.

SLOWLY ANN turns and faces him ... her grief still trapped

inside her ... JACK can see in her eyes how close he is to

losing her.

ANN stares at him a beat ... tears begin to spill from her

eyes. Slowly she rises to her feet and walks hesitantly towards

Jack.

WIDE SHOT: JACK and ANN holding each other as dawn light washes

over them.
