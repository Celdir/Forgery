1  PRIMEVAL SWAMP - EARLY DAWN

It is very early in the dawn - blue light filters through

the jungle and across a foul swamp. A mist clings to the

trees. This could be the jungle of a million years ago.

Our VIEW MOVES CLOSER, through the mist, TILTING DOWN to

the tepid water. A small bubble rises to the surface;

then another. Suddenly, but quietly, a form begins to

emerge; a helmet. Water and mud pour off revealing a set

of beady eyes just above the mud. Printed on a helmet,

in a psychedelic  hand, are the words: "Gook Killer."

The head emerges revealing that the tough-looking soldier

beneath has  exceptionally long hair and beard; he has no

shirt on, only bandoliers of ammunition - his body is

painted in an odd camouflage pattern. He looks to the

right; he looks to the left; he looks INTO CAMERA, and

slowly sinks back into the swamp, disapperaring completely.

Our VIEW HOLDS, We begin to HEAR natural, though

unrecognizable JUNGLE SOUNDS, far off in the distance.

We PAN TO REVEAL a clump of logs half submerged in the

swamp; and part of what seems to be a Falstaff beer can

in the mud. A hand reaches out, and the beer can disappears.

As we TILT UP, we NOTICE that the log is hollow

and houses the rear of a M-60 machine gun, hand painted

in a paisley design.

Now the VIEW MOVES AWAY, ACROSS the ancient growth, PAST

the glimmer of what seems to be another soldier hiding in

ambush, wearing an exotic hat made from birds and bushes.

ACROSS to a dark trail where the legs of those in black

pajamas move silently across our ever TIGHTENING VIEW.

Their feet, boots and sandals leave no impression; make

no sound. A slight flicker of light reveals a pair of

eyes in the foliage across the path, waiting and watching.

The VIEW PUSHES ALONG WITH the Vietnamese, MOVING FASTER

AND FASTER WITH them, until suddenly, directly in front

about ten feet away, an enormous AMERICAN clad in rags

and bushes and holding a 12 gauge automatic shotgun

casually at his side, steps in front of them. He smiles

laconically, and BLASTS OUT FIVE SHOTS that rip THROUGH

US. By the second shot, the whole jungle blazes out

with AUTOMATIC FIRE.

Out VIEW TURNS as the men around us are thrown and torn,

screaming and scattering into the jungle. More AMERICANS

appear; unexplainably, out of the growth. It is now that

we fully SEE the bizarre manner in which they are dressed.

Some wear helmets, others wear strange hats made from

feathers and parts of animals. Some of them have long

savage-looking hair; other crew-cut or completely shaved;

they wear bandoliers, flak jackets, shorts and little else.

They wear Montagnard sandals or no shoes at all, and their

bodies and faces are painted in bizarre camouflage patterns.

They appear one with the jungle and mist, FIRING INTO US

as they move.

The soldier we saw earlier emerges from the swamp, dripping

mud, his MACHINE GUN BLASTING FIRE.

We begin to move quickly with one Vietnamese, breathlessly

running for his life; we MOVE INTO the jungle with him,

only to be impaled on a large spear of a smiling AMERICAN

painted and wearing feathers like an Indian. OUR VIEW

FALLS WITH him to the ground, STARING UPWARDS, as FLAME

and EXPLODING MUD scatter above us. Men scream and die

around us. The screams amid the GUNFIRE and EXPLOSIONS

are piercing and terrible, as though the jungle itself is

frightened.

An AMERICAN wearing a jungle hat with a large Peace Sign

on it, wearing war paint, bends TOWARD US, reaching down

TOWARD US with a large knife, preparing to scalp the

dead.

OUR VIEW MOVES AWAY, along with the running sandals of a

Vietnamese soldier, MOVING FASTER AND FASTER, only to be

stopped by still another of the savage-looking AMERICANS

with primitive ornamentation, wearing only a loin-cloth

and green beret. He opens his flame-thrower directly ON US

and the NVA soldier and we are incinerated in flame,

bright psychedelic orange-red flame. Outrageous, loud,

electric ROCK MUSIC OVERWHELMS the SOUNDTRACK :

2  TITLE SEQUENCE

The CREDIT TITLES proceed as the FLANE CONSUME US,

growing more intense, brighter, more vivid, purifying;

transforming into an intense white heat that we can barely

look at, like the sun itself.

Then it EXPLODES, breking apart, and shattering once

again. It begins to cool, as the TITLES CONTINUE. It

is as though WE ARE MOVING through the white center of

cooling flame, forming a spinning web, and becoming more

distant. The TITLES CONTINUE.

We are MOVING TOWARD planetary nebulae; MOVING through the

stars; MOVING closer to the Earth. We can BARELY HEAR the

MUSIC  now.

We MOVE CLOSER to the earth; beautiful, covered in clouds,

as though SEEN from a satellite. The TITLES CONTINUE.

We are MOVING CLOSER to the earth; through the soft clouds,

close enough that we can MAKE OUT the Western Hemisphere;

CLOSER to North America; CLOSER, to America, then California;

Los Angeles, STILL CLOSER to the odd, finger-like

shapes of :

3  EXT. MARINA DEL REY

The VIEW finally SETTLES ON a partically luxury cabin

cruiser harbored at a particular dock late in the day.

It is large, pleasure boat: The people are relaxing in

bathing suits and towels and robes. They are drinking

cocktails, and snapping pictures. The boat belongs to the

head of a large American Corporation, and this is his

party. This man, CHARLIE, is sitting, his shirt off to

catch some of the late sun. Others have their faces

smeared with white suntan oil that reminds us of war

paint. Charlie is going on and on :

He takes a newspaper, draws a circle.

He leans to his associates, in a half-whisper.

The VIEW BEGINS TO PULL AWAY from this group.

Gradually, Charlie's voice softens as we MOVE AWAY, and a

NEW VOICE, the voice of someone thinking, COMES IN OVER it :

I don't tahe chances, and			Bullshit. You can kill

The VIEW MOVE ALONG the guests of this small party :

Pictures being taken, some people are swimming. It is the

good life. Now WILLARD'S VOICE TRACK DOMINATES.

Our VIEW IS MOVING through the people on the boat; some

reading, flirting, drinking.

We can now SEE A MAN with his BACK TO US, looking the

opposite way. An attache case resting near to him. We

MOVE CLOSER.

We are now RESTING on his back. Occasionally, he sips

from a beer, but we cannot see his face.

4  EXT. A STREET IN SAIGON - DAY

A Saigon boom street in late 1968. There are bars and

shops for servicemen; the rickshaws, the motorbikes.

Our VIEW MOVES TOWARD one particular officer; B.L.

WILLARD , in uniform, a Captain of the Airborne, followed

by four or five Vietnamese kids trying to shine his

shoes and sell him things.

Willard looks back.

5  HIS VIEW

an American CIVILIAN.

6  MED. VIEW

Willard ducks into a bar.

7  INT. THE SAIGON BAR - DAY

Not much in this place -- a bar, linoleum flooring, a few

tables and chairs, and a juke box. The lounge is fairly

crowded. Willard takes off his cap and walks quietly

past the soldiers at the bar. Some of them, catching

sight of his ribbons, stop talking as he moves by.

An INFANTRY CAPTAIN enters the bar, buys a couple of

drinks and approaches Willard's table.

He sits down at the table with the drinks.

The JUKE BOX starts BLARING. Annoyed , Willard looks over

his shoulder.

He reaches into his shirt pocket for a cigarette, and the

Captain leans over the table to light it for him. Willard

notices the CIVILIAN on the street has glanced in the bar,

then enters and sits down at a table by the doorway.

Willard glances over his shoulder and indicates the

Civilian. The Civilian is given a sign by the Captain.

He rises and comes over to the bar.

Willard looks at the Civilian a moment, and then walks

roght out toward the jeep without saying another word.

The Civilian follows.

8  EXT. HELICOPTER - DUSK

A darkly painted "HUEY" ROARS over low paddies and jungle

before emerging onto an open plain. It crosses a barbed

wire and sand-bagged perimeter and lands in a heavily

fortified, concealed compound.

Armed men jump from the Huey -- among them Willard. A

large camouflaged cover is moved, revealing an underground

corridor -- they enter.

9  FULL SHOT - UNDERGROUND PLOTTING ROOM

A door swings wide -- Willard steps through and comes to

attention, blocking the view of the room. A strange

reddish light pervades. The room is covered with plastic

maps and filled with smoke.

The whole place has been hewn out of the ground itself

and there is a sense of the cut-back jungle growth slowly

reclaiming it.

Willard sits in a chair that is set in a center of a

bare concrete floor. Across from him, around steel desks

and tables sit several men. The nearest one, a COLONEL

puts his cigar out on the bottom of his shoe -- behind

him sits a MAJOR and a seedy-looking CIVILIAN.

He points to the Major.

He turns to the Colonel and nods his approval. The

Colonel gets up and goes to a large plastic map.

The officer smiles at this.

10  CLOSE VIEW - ON THE MAP

11  MED VIEW

The Major looks at some papers in front of him.

He puts Kurtz' dossier in Willard's hand.

The Colonel gets up and walks over to a tape recorder,

flicks it on. The recording is first STATIC -- the

AIR CONTROLLER then asks for more information on target

coordinates -- it all sounds very routine, military.

Then a frantic VOICE comes on, talking slurred, like

someone dumb, except very fast.

GUNFIRE is HEARD and a lower, slower VOICE in background.

A heavy BURST of AUTOMATIC WEAPONS FIRE -- INSANE LAUGHTER

-- STATIC, and faintly, very faintly we HEAR HARD ROCK

MUSIC -- more STATIC -- suddenly a low, clear VOICE

peaceful and serene, almost tasting the words.

STATIC interrupts -- the Major turns the machine off.

Willard shrugs.

The Major offers him one; they wait as he lights up, thinks.

12  FULL VIEW - ON THE DELTA

A waterway leading out to the ocean -- it is broken and

divided into hundreds of channels, islands, water farms.

A Navy patrol boat (P.B.R.) is waiting by a dock area.

This is small, light craft, very fast, and heavily

armed. Its men stand at attention in a small and simple

military ceremony. Willard approaches them in battle-

dress: Tiger suit, full field pack, forty-five, helmet,

M-16. The boat commander salutes Willard.

13  MED. VIEW

We hear the introductions faintly, UNDER Willard's VOICE.

The Chief nods.  They all break formation and jump aboard

and otherwise go about their work.

The twin diesels kick up -- and t he boat moves away from

the dock. The Chef jumps aboard; Lance mans the forward

twin fifty-caliber machine guns -- they wave to the guards

on the dock and move away into the complexity that leads

to the ocean.

14  FULL VIEW - STORMY SEA

The boat slams through the heavy sea ; hurtling off the

top of a wave and crashing full into the trough of another.

15  MED. SHOT - BOAT COCKPIT - WILLARD AND CHIEF

Willard holds on to whatever he can -- he looks very pale.

Water crashes over the bow and drenches everyone. The

Chief mans the wheel and the ENGINES WHINE. Lance climbs

back from his position. He looks at Willard, who just

stares ahead into space, swallowing.

16  LONG SHOT - BOAT DUSK

The dusk is spectacular through the broken storm clouds --

the sea is calm again.

17  VIEW ON THE BOAT - PROCEEDING UP THE COAST

The Chief is at the helm -- Willard approaches him.

Pause, looking at Willard.

18  CLOSE SHOT - ON WILLARD

Suddenly, his attention is diverted -- there is a slow

buffeting, as if the air around them is being sucked out

and replaced quickly. The boat shakes slightly. There

is a distant ROLLING NOISE like interrupted thunder. All

the men have stopped whatever they're doing -- stand up

and look out toward the shore and the green jungle hills

beyond. The buffeting and NOISE CONTINUES -- they all

stand silently -- suddenly it stops.

He points up to the sky.

19 FULL SHOT - ON THE SKY

Way up -- past any clouds and barely discernible, we SEE

the black silhouttes of four B-52 bombers, their vapor

trails streaming white against the dark blue sky.

20  FULL SHOT - BOAT - CREW

They are looking up. Willard sits down, unconcerned.

He takes out the dossier given him by ComSec. He

flips through the letters and other documents.

Occasionally, in the b.g., we FEEL the terrifying buffeting

of the distant B-52 BOMBING.

21  CLOSE - ON WILLARD

studying, examining a report.

22  MONTAGE - PICTURES OF KURTZ

Kurtz' face evolves through the various stages of his

career as represented in the pictures in the dossier,

as Willard reads :

Another picture of Kurtz in Germany, standing next to the

161st Petroleum Supply Group sign.

A SHOT of Kurtz at jump school.

A CLOSE SHOT of Kurtz with Green Beret on in the Vietnam

jungle. His face is blank and vacant.

MOVE IN TO Kurtz' empty eyes until the photograph is just

a BLURRED MASS OF DOTS.

23  EXT. HAU FAT - AN ADVANCE STAGING AREA

The VIEW OF THE COASTLINE leading up along the long load-

ing docks at Hau Fat, an advance staging area for opera-

tions "Brute Force" and "Mailed Fist."

Everywhere are tents -- oil drums -- sandbagged bunkers --

helicopters -- tanks -- guns -- men. Nobody builds

advanced staging areas like the Americans.

As the P.B.R. approaches the docking area, Lance notices

something.

They look as a Chris-craft speeds by pulling a fancy water-

skier who waves as he slaloms by. The men just look at

one another.

24  VIEW ON THE DOCK

The P.B.R. pulls in -- the men scan the busy surroundings.

25  FULL SHOT - PARADE GROUNDS - TROOPS

A platoon drills in the hot, lazy sun; they are clean and

pale, in contrast to Lance and the others, just off the

airplane.

The troops turn and march TOWARD US with six weeks of

Advanced Infantry Training to back them up.

26  FULL SHOT - DOCK - P.B.R. - CREW

They are tying up at the dock -- a young SERGEANT is fill-

ing cut papers concerning them and talking with Willard.

He signs it quickly, leaving the Sergeant totally confused.

He points --

27  FULL SHOT - PARADE GROUNDS - PEDESTAL

A large, well-built pedestal has been erected -- this is

surrounded by a deep moat filled with punji stakes and

garnished with concertina wire. It is empty --

28  FULL SHOT - PARADE GROUNDS - TROOPS

The entire area around the pedestal and right up to the

wire is mobbed with seething American fighting men. Some

of these boys have just gotten here -- others have been in

the jungle for months. All have one thing in common, to

see and if possible grab an American girl. Their need far

surpasses that of the run-of-the-mill rapist, pervert,

or child-molester. To counter their need of course are

the moat, punji stakes and barbed wire -- but implementing

this are seven "riot control positions" equipped with the

lastest in teargas launchers, attack-trained German shep-

herds and assorted psychological warfare aides. Even so

armed, the great mass of wild men are right up to the wire.

29 FORWARD AREA

jammed in the crowd

In the b.g., we begin to HEAR a SWELL of TWO THOUSAND

MALE VOICES; the ENGINES of four helicopters approaching.

All heads turn skywards while one descends onto the

pedestal kicking up a lot of dust and general resentment.

On the nose amd doors of the black Huey are painted large

Playboy rabbits. Finally the blades are trimmed and a

strange silence descends over the men. The door of the

copter slides partially open -- two young Green Berets

step out with M-16's to varied catcalls. When this

abates a young, extremelly well-dressed man emerges. He

is the epitome of a Hollywood AGENT. Hair is combed

impeccably and free of dandruff -- clothes are formal

but hip -- shoes are shined -- Quite some dude -- his

presence causes some stirring but seems to strangely

quiet the man.

He walks over to the microphone.

He pulls open the door and three unbelieveably beautiful

sex playmates in fringed go-go outfits leap out and start

dancing to the Creedence Clearwater Revival singing

"Suzy Q."

30  MONTAGE ON THE GIRLS AND MEN

VARIOUS SHOTS as the girls dance in an incredibly erotic

manner -- smiling.

The faces of the G.I.'s pass -- their jaws drop -- some

look almost horrified. Chef is hypnotized -- Mr. Clean

cries. Chief mouths unspoken obscenities with sentimental

tenderness.

Others grab the air in front of them. With each movement

their need increases by the square.

31  FULL SHOT - PEDESTAL - GIRLS - MEN

They crush forward starting to scream -- men fall on the

wire -- the guards in the "riot control positions" forget

-- the attack dogs are trampled. The mob as one surges

forward onto the wire. Men scream and fall into the moat,

which is filling up fast. The Agent sees this all as he

has seen it before. He casually pulls the pin of a smoke

grenade; the girls retreat into the copter -- he follows,

then the two Green Berets. The ROTARS WHINE -- the black

Playboy Huey lifts off just as the first crazed men reach

it. They grab frantically for the wheels, but miss. The

Huey wheels up into the blue sky, leaving them all below.

Such are the ways of war.

32  EXT. FULL VIEW - DAY

The P.B.R. moving further up the primitive coastline.

There are few signs of civilization; no villages, no

boats -- just the overwhelming presence of the jungle.

Suddenly, Chief looks out, ahead.

They all turn. Chief points up the coast.

33 FULL SHOT - THE COASTLINE

A thick train of black smoke rises from the green jungle.

The Chief grabs field glasses.

34 FULL SHOT - THE BEACH AND VILLAGE

A vast field of devastation -- smashed and smoking palm

trees -- deep, ragged craters -- gutted and burning huts

-- shattered sampans and bodies washing around in the

surf.

35  MED. SHOT - BEACH - WILLARD AND CREW

They wade through the water to the beach where they are

met by a heavily armed group of men.

Overhead jets swoop by FIRING ROCKETS, the NOISE drowning

out Willard's attempt at conversation with some of the men.

We can't hear any of the talk, but we notice that the

Sergeant turns up to a particular Huey, and points to it.

36  FULL SHOT - HELICOPTERS

Three Hueys swoop in low -- they are heavily laden with

machine guns -- rockets and loudspeakers. The two out-

side copters hover, while the center copter lands, raising

a lot of dust. It cuts its rotors and the other copters

pull up and off to the side. Two armed soldiers jump

from the doors and stand with guns ready. Then a tall,

strong looking man emerges. He wears a well-cut and

neatly-stretched tiger suit. It is COLONEL WILLIAM KILGORE

-- tough looking, well-tanned, with a black mustache.

He crouches over, holding his hat in the rotor wash. It

is no ordinary hat but a L.A. Dodgers baseball hat. He

walks out, and then stards to his full immense height and

with his hands on his hips he surveys the field of battle.

His eyes are obscured by mirror-fronted sunglasses.

A Lieutenant and radio man nod and rush off.

37  CLOSE VIEW ON WILLARD

He was not quite prepared for this.

38  VIEW ON KILGORE

turning to his GUARDS

The soldier rushes over and hands him two brand new

packages of playing cards wrapped in plastic. Two other

soldiers get out of the copter and walk over. They are

well-tanned and carry no weapons. They seem more casual

about the Colonel than anyone else. The Sergeant walks

up, leading Willard, the Chief and Lance.

He cracks the plastic wrapping sharply -- takes out the

deck of new cards and fans them. The Colonel strides

right past Willard with no further acknowledgement. The

others follow,

39  TRACKING VIEW

The Colonel walks through the shell-pocked field of

devastation. Soldiers gather around smiling; as Kilgore

comes to each V.C. corpse he drops a playing card on

it -- carefully picking out which card he uses.

The Colonel goes on about this business.

40  TRACKING ON KILGORE

moving through the corpses, dropping the cards.

On of the two tanned soldiers rushes up and whispers

something to him. He stops.

The soldier points to Lance, who immediately puts down

the card he was holding. Kilgore strides over to the

young man, who almost instinctively moves closer t

Willard.

Kilgore smiles -- sticks out his hand.

41 VIEW ON WILLARD

His entire, top priority  mission has been put in the

background.

Lance blushes, sort of mumbling thanks.

Willard eats it, for now. Kilgore puts his hand on

Lance's shoulder, and continues flipping the cards in-

discriminately on the bodies as they talk.

He passes a twisted gun emplacement with about five

bodies -- sprinkles cards all over them.

He stops at a particularly wild-looking Viet Cong who

has died with his mouth agape -- staring wild-eyed in

horror at the sky. Kilgore pauses.

He puts the card in the gaping mouth.

42  CLOSE VIEW OVER THE VIET CONG

We SEE the Colonel and the others walk off -- the dead

Viet Cong and card are in the immediate f.g. The card

has the shield of the CAV printed bautifully, and above

it the motto: DEATH FROM ABOVE.

43  EXT. THE HELICOPTER - MED. SHOT

Willard is sitting with Kilgore on acouple of chairs by

a table set up in front of the command copter.

Everywhere we SEE armed men, sandbags, barbed wire, oil

drums etc. Hueys are constantly ROARING over. ARTILLERY

BOOMS in the far distance. Kilgore looks at the map.

He puts his finger on the map.

He motions to one of his surfers.

Willard looks at Lance -- then at Kilgore.

Kilgore gazes out across the parked helicopters.

Willard nudges Lance -- who gets the idea.

Kilgore turns and looks to Willard, exasperated.

44  FULL SHOT - HELICOPTERS - DAWN

What seems like hundreds of Hueys standing, their rotors

churning a great wind -- Inside, the men of the 1st

Cavalry Airmobile -- toughest unit in Vietnam.

Kilgore's helicopter is being loaded with ammunition and

has surfboards strapped underneath.

45  MED. VIEW

Kilgore strides up to the side door, dressed for battle.

He looks out, around. He turns to his door GUNNER.

He turns to his R.T. man.

46  FULL VIEW

Helicopter rotors build up speed -- gas turbines

belching fire from their jet pipes -- dust flying

as fifty helicopters rise; ROAR OVER CAMERA and

deploy into attack formation.

47  NEW VIEW

Helicopters moving THROUGH the FRAME: almost a dance of

dragonflies.

48  INT. COMMAND COPTER - MED. SHOT - KILGORE, WILLARD,

Willard looks ahead -- Kilgore sits near the door.

Below they see the jungle whisk by and they are

suddenly over the ocean, low and fast.

49  MONTAGE

CLOSE SHOTS of rocket pods -- mini-guns in bizarre

looking mounts.

CLOSE SHOTS of the three surfboards strapped below the

command helicopter, next to the fearsome weaponry.

And finally, CLOSE SHOTS of the men -- nervous, excited

very few of them really scared -- they fondle their

rifles, grenade launchers, anti-personnel grenades,

claymore mines; plastic explosives cord; flame-throwers;

M-60 machine guns; expandable rocket launchers; mortars

and bayonets.

50  INT. COMMAND COPTER

Kilgore cranes his neck and almost leans out to watch

the waves -- then he sits back relaxed.

51  MED. SHOT

POV behind the PILOT and CO-PILOT -- the ocean rushes

below.

The helicopter banks into a tight turn and bears

toward the coast.

52  CLOSE SHOT - LOUDSPEAKERS

The ocean rushes below as suddenly the LOUDSPEAKERS

BLARE out Wagner's "Ride of the Valkyries."

53  FULL SHOT - HELICOPTERS

From the water we SEE the massive grouping of Hueys -- gun-

ships -- troop carriers -- medevac and recon -- ROAR over

low in battle formation BLARING out "Ride of the Valkyries."

54  INT. HELICOPTER - MED. SHOT -CREW

POV behind pilot --

The whole copter shakes.

55  EXT. VIET CONG FISHING VILLAGE - FULL SHOT

A Vietnamese coastal fishing village built along the

beach and palm trees -- with rice paddies behind. This

village commands a delta where ocean and river merge.

Sampans are pulled into a cover where they are being

unloaded. We SEE bunkers with N.V.A. regulars ambling

about.

Suddenly we HEAR the distant MUSIC -- Everyone stops;

they stare out to see. Men scream orders -- women run

from huts bearing ammunition and rifles -- Everywhere

there is activity to prepare for the defense of the

village.

Camouflage is removed from anti-aircraft emplacements.

People feverishly unlimber weapons of all types and run

to tunnels and trenches.

The MUSIC GROWS LOUDER with the FAINT SOUND of ROTORS

56  EXT. THE HELICOPTER FORMATION - AERIAL VIEW

The whole copter shakes.

59  EXT. HELICOPTERS - MONTAGE

We SEE rockets ROAR from pods -- MACHINE GUNS RATTLE --

grenade launchers POUND away -- and MINI-GUNS pour

streams of lead and tracers with the SOUND of a DIESEL

HORN.

60  FULL SHOT - HELICOPTERS

POV behind lead gunship. They ROAR in over the beach

streaming FIRE from doors, pods and nose -- The ground

is alive with smoke and fire -- a hut EXPLODES. The

leads ship banks sharply up over the trees -- men run

below SHOOTING back.

61  MED. SHOT - ANTI-AIRCRAFT EMPLACEMENT

EXPLOSIONS crash around -- the MUSIC and SOUND of the

COPTERS almost drown them out. The gunner FIRES

frantically -- COPTERS are ROARING over -- GUNFIRE

rips around. The gunner is blown away.

62  MED. CLOSE ON WILLARD

as the ship he is in swoops down, its MACHINE GUNS

FIRING into the village.

63  MED. SHOT - SWOOPING COPTER

The Pilot leans out and SHOOTS a charging V.C. in the

head with his .38, then ducks back in.

BULLETS RIP through the plexiglass. The Pilot FIRES

back.

64  INT. COMMAND COPTER - MED. SHOT - WILLARD, KILGORE,

Kilgore has R.T. equipment -- he leans out near the

door gunner.

65  FULL SHOT - JET SQUADRON

Four F-4H Phantoms peel off and streak toward the

coast.

66  INT. COMMAND COPTER - VIEW ON WILLARD AND KILGORE

67  HELICOPTER'S POV - THE JETS

The jets streak by below laying in huge gobs of orange

napalm along the trees.

68  INT. COMMAND COPTER - MED. SHOT

They circle the battle.

He turns to door gunner.

The gunner FIRES leaning out --

He leans back in.

Suddenly, BULLETS SMASH through the copter -- Plexiglass

SHATTERS; the copter vibrates and turns sharply. Kilgore

is thrown down where he hangs on.

He grabs the R.T.

69  FULL SHOT - THE TREES, HELICOPTERS

The two helicopters swoop up out of the smoke and blast

the trees with ROCKETS, MACHINE GUNS and GRENADE LAUNCHERS.

Other copters join -- The V.C. break and run through

the rice paddies in the f.g. -- BULLETS EXPLODING around

them -- they scream and fall FIRING back.

70 INT. COMMAND COPTER - MED. SHOT - KILGORE, WILLARD

Kilgore looks out as three V.C. break and run through

the rice paddies -- the helicopter turns and follows

them -- the door gunner swings out and BLASTS two of

them into the mud. He takes a bead on the third.

He puts his arms across the sights -- the gunner swings

back inside.

They rise above the paddy -- the man below runs for

all he's worth. Kilgore motions to the door gunner who

steps aside. Kilgore buckles himself into the gunner's

harness.

A hand passes him a M-16.

There is some fumbling and then a hand passes him a 300

Weatherby Magnum with a zebra wood stock -- mother of pearl

inlays and a variable power scope. Kilgore takes it and

opens the bolt.

71  VIEW ON WILLARD

Amazed at these proceedings.

72  VIEW ON KILGORE

as he loads the rifle with huge cartridges. He gets

into the sling and slams the bolt shut.

73  MOVING POV. ON THE V.C.

He is running hard, but starting to sink into the mud.

The Huey DRONES overhead, its huge shadow behind him

on the mud. He turns and FIRES with a pistol.

74  INT. COPTER - MED. SHOT - KILGORE, WILLARD

Kilgore leans out; pulls the gun in tight -- takes

careful aim and the Cong is BLASTED flat into the paddy.

Kilgore leans back, opens the bolt, ejecting the spent

cartridge out the door. He hands Weatherby back

into the copter.

75  VIEW ON WILLARD

The gaudy rifle passed by him.

Somebody hands Willard the deck. He takes a card and

flips it out of the copter, never lifting his gaze from

Kilgore.

76  FULL SHOT - BATTLEFIELD - THE CAV, V.C.

Americans run through the hooches FIRING and throwing

GRENADES. Helicopters swoop overhead -- JETS ROAR by

-- Uniformed N.V.A. regulars burst from a tunnel en-

trance and charge the Americans. The SHOOTING is at

point blank range -- automatic, as the V.C. are cut

down.

77  INT. COMMAND COPTER - KILGORE, WILLARD, LANCE, ETC.

Kilgore leans out carefully, looking over the battle-

field. He has the R.T.

He leans back, deliberately avoiding Willard to speak

to Lance.

He looks out toward the ocean.

Lance looks at Willard and then agrees.

78  FULL SHOT - COPTER, SURF

The pilots are used to this -- they bank sharply

and swoop in on the lineup of waves, coming in  low

over the point and streaking down a long, lined-up

green wall as if surfing it. They tip up over and up

at the last minute as the wave breaks.

79  FULL SHOT - BEACH HUTS, SOLDIERS

Americans line up blindfolded Viet Cong and N.V.A.

regular troops outside a burning hut. GUNFIRE is

DISTANT and sporadic -- an occasional MORTAR round

SCREAMS in. A soldier yells in Vietnamese in a

southern accent and the prisoners are marched away.

Other soldiers are already setting up heavy weapons

emplacements -- 50 cal machine guns etc. Three

Hueys ROAR in, fanning the smoke with their wind.

The center one, the command ship, lands. JETS SCREAM

over and the two gunships pull up at 200 feet. Another

Huey zooms in low and lands behind the Colonel's. The

doors open, guards jump out, check the situation, and

out steps Kilgore and Lance. From the other copter

are more guards, Kilgore's surfers and others of the

P.B.R. crew. Willard follows.

80  FULL SHOT - THE POINT

They stride out across the debris-strewn beach. Kilgore

stands majestically on the point watching the waves. A

SHELL SCREAMS overhead.

They all dive, except Kilgore. He is watching a big set

-- the SHELL EXPLODES in the water about a hundred yards

away, sending up a huge geyser of spray. Kilgore is

unmoved.

They look.

Kilgore pays him no mention.

He turns to Mike and Johnny who have their faces in the

sand.

He nods yes meakly.

They turn and hurry off -- Kilgore grabs an M-1 from

one of the guards. They all think he's going to

shoot the surfers or someone. They move back uneasy.

He cocks thye weapon. Lance looks around uneasily. The

Colonel walks over.

A SHELL SCREAMS OVER -- they all hit the dirt except

for Kilgore. It EXPLODES throwing sand through the

air. Kilgore leans down yelling over the NOISE.

Lance looks up at him terrified, holding onto

his helmet.

81  FULL SHOT - SURF - MIKE AND JOHNNY

They walk through shallows carrying brightly

colored boards. They look very scared. JETS SCREAM

overhead, FIRING CANNONS. Helicopters wheel by

carrying out wounded.

They wear olive drab surfing trunks with the Cav's

shield on the left leg. The same shield is emblazoned

on the boards along the word "Airmobile". They edge

into the water and paddle through the mild shorebreak.

82  FULL SHOT - THE POINT - SURFERS

They paddle up the point in the calm channel -- the

beautiful waves breaking beyond them.

83  CLOSE SHOT ON JOHNNY, MIKE

They paddle on their stomachs, keeping low -- breathing

hard and constantly looking around scared out of their

minds.

84  MED. SHOT - KILGORE AND LANCE

Kilgore looks at them with his field glasses. Lance

kind of sits below taking cover in a shell hole.

Kilgore turns and takes a giant electric megaphone from

a waiting lackey.

85  FULL SHOT - THE POINT, SURFERS

They line themselves up on the point. A good set is

building. Mike turns strokes into it -- takes off

-- drops to the bottom and turns -- trims up into a

tight section -- everything right except he keeps looking

around frantically.

86  CLOSE SHOT ON LANCE AND KILGORE

Another SHELL SCREAMS over and EXPLODES down the beach.

Lance looks over at Willard.

A SERIES of SHELLS ROAR in.

Lance ducks -- puts his hands over his head. The SHELLS

SCREAM over Kilgore and out towards the point. Kilgore

looks through his glasses -- two EXPLOSIONS in the water

are HEARD.

Lance looks up and out toward the point in horror.

87  FULL SHOT - THE POINT

Two surfboards float in the channel bobbing up and down

on the waves.

88  MED. SHOT - LANCE AND KILGORE

Willard looks over, beginning to think Lance is crazy,

too.

Lance looks up.

89 FULL SHOT - THE POINT , SURFERS

They come up near their boards and climb on -- smoke

hangs over the water.

90  BACK TO SCENE

He turns to Willard.

91  CLOSE SHOT ON KILGORE

He turns, glowering to his lackeys.

He grabs it.

He throws the R.T. back to a soldier -- another SALVO

WHISTLES over -- everyone drops.

As the SHELLS EXPLODES on the beach behind him, KIlgore

raises his M-16 and EMPTIES it full automatic in the

general direction of the trees. He mumbles a few un-

intelligible swear words and jams a new clip into his

rifle turning to Lance --

He FIRES another clip as the JETS SCREAM overhead.

92  FULL SHOT - RIVER - COPTERS

A sky-crane without pod descends slowly toward us --

The P.B.R. hangs below it.

The Chief, mr. Clean and Chef stand watching this sight

alomg with other soldiers. A man guides the descending

copter till the boat settles carefully in the shallows.

The Chief and others leap aboard; unshackle the hoists

-- load on ammunition and fuel. The battle is still

going on around them. They all look up as a wadge

of PHANTOMS streak over low and peel off one by one to

begin their bombing run.

93  FULL SHOT - PHANTOMS - MONTAGE

Phantoms RAKE the trees with 20 mm CANNONS -- FIRE five

inch ROCKETS in salvo -- "Bull Pup" MISSILES -- drop

H.E. (high explosives) and C.B.U's (Cluster Bomb Units)

and finally an immense amount of NAPALM.

94  FULL SHOT ON THE P.B.R.

The Chief is at the helm --the engine starts; Clean

and Chef work feverishly, ducking for cover every-so-

often when an EXPLOSION hits nearby. The boat begins

to back out of the shallows. The EXPLOSIONS of NAPALM

are reflected on their faces; the ROAR of the FIRE drowns

out almost everything.

Two HELICOPTERS SCREAM over FIRING ROCKETS.

95  FULL SHOT - THE POINT - KILGORE, WILLARD , LANCE,

Kilgore watches the waves with his field glasses --

smoke drifts over.

Lance crouches below. Willard is up looking off in another

direction. SHELLS SCREAM over, but even their noise is

drowned out by the fierce SHRIEK of the PHANTOMS and the

deafening BLAST of HIGH EXPLOSIVES. Willard stares at the

tree line where it comes down to the river. The JETS are

making a hell of the tree line; a hell of fire and bust-

ling steam thet nothing could live in. Willard's glance

goes further downriver through the black smoke and there

merging in the river -- small and vulnerable, is his boat.

Lance looks over --  a tremendous relief on his face. But

still there remains the threat of Kilgore, standing stark

against the sky. Willard silently motions Lance toward

the boat.

Kilgore FIRES another clip at the tree line, and then

strides back without looking at them.

They reflect the glow from the burning trees.

He looks off nostalgically.

Suddenly he senses something -- he stops -- lifts his

hand -- then frantically licks his fingers and puts

them up in the air.

Sure enough there is a rushing breeze that increases.

He leans down and practically grabs Lance.

They turn and stare out to sea.

96  FULL SHOT - THE POINT - SURFERS

The wind has changed. Instead of blowing spray back

over the waves and hollowing them out, this strange

wind is causing white caps and cross chop.. reducing

the swell to slop. Mike and Johnny lay low on their

boards, overjoyed.

97  MED. SHOT - THE BEACH - LANCE, KILGORE, WILLARD

Slapping Lance on the shoulder.

He turns toward the trees.

He staggers off toward the trees followed by his

guards and other lackeys.

Lance motions with his eyes to Willard.

98  FULL SHOT ON THE P.B.R.

The P.B.R. along the river shallows -- The Chief and

crew waiting and yelling.

99  MED. VIEW ON WILLARD AND LANCE

They break and run like hell toward the boat in the

distance. OUR VIEW TRACKS with them. They are

cheered by the crew -- suddenly, Willard sees some-

thing and stops... Lance continuing. In a pile of

equipment that the Hueys have left are two surfboards

-- Willard looks at them.

Willard glances over to it with determination. There

is still MORTAR FIRE coming in between him and the

board. Suddenly, Willard makes a run for it.

The ROUNDS bracket the P.B.R. and line up the beach

toward Willard. He stands there and doesn't move, the

surfboard under his arm. The shells kick up sand.

Lance has dropped. Fragments whistle by, one rips

a chunk of foam and fibreglass from the rain of the

board.

Once again, Willard takes off fast as hell with the

board under his arm. Lance follows toward the boat,

through the water. Willard hands the board up to Mr.

Clean, and they both scamper abroad, exhausted and

relieved.

Mr. Clean stuffs the board in the stern 50 Cal. mount.

The boat turns -- ENGINES RUNNING HARD and ROARS OFF

toward the deeper water of the river -- the board

clearly visible on the stern.

100  FULL SHOT ON THE RIVER - P.B.R

The P.B.R. ROARS BY going down the river at full speed.

It is swerving and zig-zagging to avoid potential enemy

fire.

101  MED. SHOT ON THE CREW

They all are in full battle positions -- their twin

fifty Cal. guns turning; warily covering the jungled

banks. The Chief is at helm -- Willard crouches

against some armor plate, huddled with his M-16 ready.

Chef is behind him at the radio. Lance leans back

from his forward turret.

They all look up into the sky -- expecting the worst.

The Chief nods.

They all look at Willard uneasily. After a suspensful

pause, Willard smiles:

He fishes into his breast pocket -- pulls out a huge

cigar-sized joint. They all smile -- Willard lights

up.

102  FULL SHOT - THE P.B.R.

It zig-zags away from us down the river at high speed.

103  FULL SHOT - THE TREES, BOAT, CREW - NIGHT

The boat is hidden under some trees along the river

bank. The men wait tensely listening --

Lance looks over at Willard.

Willard smiles.

A pause, and then suddenly his attention is diverted --

They all are silent -- It is pitch dark -- we HEAR the

distant SOUND of ROTOR-BLADES and indistinguishable

language on a loudspeaker -- The talk stops -- the

ROTORS grow LOUDER until almost overhead.

The HELICOPTER DRONES on into the night -- the same

speech starts again further off -- Finally the noise

ceases.

Chef steps forward with a plastic basket.

They all look at him.

He grabs an M-16 and follows Chef over the side.

104  MED. SHOT - THE JUNGLE - CHEF, WILLARD - NIGHT

They cautiously walk through the underbrush.

They move into a slight clearing.

Chef crouches close -- redies his M-16. Willard ges-

tures that he heard something; he points.

105  MED. SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE

PAN SLOWLY over jungle -- END REVEALING Willard and Chef.

He points -- motions Chef to move away -- they cover

the spot. A few yards from them they hear something

move. It is obviously no small jungle creature. They

walk toward a patch of black elephant grass; their guns

at the ready. They look at each other. Willard is

cold, methodical, doing something he knows well. There

is a noise again -- some of the growth rustles.  He

and Chef move a distance apart, and join in stalking

the probable V.C. Willard directs the Chef with hand

gestures, and bird and cricket sounds. They move

stealthily, closing the apex of their triangle on the

hunted. The two men drop low into the elephant grass,

and remain motionless. Then Willard makes the cricket

noise, and they move closer. Willard's left hand edges

out along the M-16's far end, so that he only has to

point the finger of that hand and he will hit what he

wants. He makes another command and they rush the

trapped enemy.

106  MED. SHOT - THE ELEPHANT GRASS - WILLARD AND CHEF

Suddenly there is a RUSHING SOUND -- The grass folds

down quickly toward them -- willard plants his feet and

from the hip lets go FULL AUTOMATIC. The Chef retreats

FIRING short BURSTS into the grass -- the grass folds

almost to Willard -- then a huge tiger leaps out at

them; snarling magnificently. They FIRE wildly,

emptying their clips.

He turns and bolts through the jungle, as scared as a

man can be.

Willard jams another clip in his gun and backs out of

the clearing, covering the bushes and runs, scared

out of his head as well.

107  FULL SHOT - THE BOAT - THE CREW

They all are armed -- Lance has the twin 50's pointed into

the jungle. Chef comes screaming out of the brush, throws

his rifle into the boat and dives headfirst after it.

The Chief tries to grab him; takes his gun away, but is

unable to take a hold of the Chef, as he slithers around

the boat, trying to find safety. willard follows from the

jungle -- The Chef is moaning and stares off into the night.

The ENGINE ROARS to life -- the P.B.R. pulls away with great

speed.

They move off; swallowed by the darkness. The JUNGLE

NOISES remain, as OUR VIEW BEGINS a MOVE INTO the jungle.

108  EXT. THE BOAT IN MARINA DEL RAY - NIGHT

Willard, thinking, his BACK TO US. Suddenly, he turns

around, and we SEE his face.

He lights the cigarette; the light of his match illuminating

his face momentarily. There is something different about

him; a maturity, a cool inner peace.

Willard looks toward the group of people on the boat --

there is still some MUSIC. They talk and drink and laugh.

109  WATERWAY - MOVING FORWARD - DAY

We HEAR:

110  VIEW ON CHEF

by himself on the P.B.R.; he has wiped mud under his

eyes to kill the glare; it is incredibly hot. He is

barechested, wearing a hat made of a banana palm.

111  VIEW ON THE GROUP

The SONG BLARES ON -- they all dig it.

PAN TO Willard, sitting alone in the rear, reading from

his file on Kurtz. We REVEAL Lance in the b.g., water-

skiing behind the P.B.R., slaloming back and forth on

his single ski to the MUSIC -- jumping the wake occasion-

ally.

112  NEW VIEW - ON THE P.B.R.

Lance waterskiing to "Satisfaction."

113  VIEW ON CLEAN

alert, at the rear of the boat -- his M-16 ready, just

in case.

114  VIEW ON WILLARD

We can SEE it is a private correspondence -- feminine

writing on the envelope.

115  CLOSE SHOT - ON THE LETTER

It is addressed to Colonel Walter Kurtz -- in the corner

is the return addess of Mrs. Colonel Walter Kurtz --

Willard's hand fushes through the packet and comes up

with apicture of a very attractive, thirty-five year

old American Beauty... She is classically American.

116  CLOSE SHOT - ON WILLARD

looking at the picture -- puts it back, then opens the

letter, straightens it.

Willard looks out at the jungle.

Deep imppenetrable jungle -- dark and primeval forests

pass by. The Rolling Stones CHANT on in the b.g.

117  CLOSE ON WILLARD

He folds the letter up, files through some others quickly

and gets to a peculiar envelope stamped Top Secret with

a stenciled date on it. It is also noted that this was

the last correspondence to leave Nu Mung Ba. It is

addressed to Kurtz' wife. He opens the letter -- it is

written in a scrawled savage hand to no one in partic-

ular. It reads:

He folds up the letter.

118  CLOSE SHOT - WILLARD

He looks out at the ominous jungled mountains.

119  FULL SHOT - P.B.R. - RIVER OUTPOST - RAIN

The P.B.R. pulls in towards an American outpost that is

being used as a forward medical evacuation center.

Various helicopters pads are SEEN, but only one heli-

copter -- the H-34 painted with Playboy rabbits that

brought the girls to Hau Fat. Several soldiers in rain-

coats come out the dock as the P.B.R. pulls up.

120  MED. SHOT - WILLARD, SOLDIERS

Willard looks into some empty tents -- looks around the

dreary muddy camp. Two soldiers pass.

He turns and walks off babbling incoherently --

The soldier he was talking to turns around smiling

idiotically and making animal noises. He stumbles off

after his friend.

121  MED. SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE - WILLARD

He looks around disgustedly

Willard turns around looking for where the voice came

from.

He turns to see the Hollywood Agent under the flap of a

large tent so that he won't get wet. He wears the same

clothes as before, but is much dirtier. He motions

Willard into the tent.

122  INT. TENT - MED. SHOT - WILLARD, AGENT

They duck inside -- it is dark and damp.

On cots around astove sit the three playmates and the

pilot. The nearest one, CATHY, a blonde, picks leeches

out of her feet. The other two, TERRI and LYNDA, play

cards with the helicopter pilot. Willard looks over

the situation.

They all look over.

He turns and starts to leave.

Willard is almost out of the tent.

He turns around.

The Pilot laughs.

Willard just stares at her -- even though she's in jeans

and field jacket she is something to see -- The Agent

takes Willard aside -- Terri goes back to the others.

Willard turns to leave again.

Willard sits down on a metal chair -- motions the Agent

to do likewise.

The girls are trying to pretend they're not listening --

the helicopter Pilot is cackling to himself.

Willard gets up.

He gets up and starts out.

Willard turns around slowly.

He turns to go under the tent flap.

He leaves.

123  FULL SHOT - P.B.R. - CREW

They are all working on patching the boat and cleaning

it up in general. Mr. Clean sits in f.g., cleaning an M-16.

Behins them on the beach stand several water buffaloes

eating mud or whatever they do. They are painted jungle

brown and green camouflage with grey bottoms -- on their

sides the words have been stenciled in black:

Willard walks through them down to the boat.

They all look up.

124  INT. TENT - MED. SHOT - LYNDA, CHEF

He has followed her into the tent awe-struck -- she

casuallu starts unbuttoning her fatigue jacket and taking

off her pants. he just stands there, his arms at his

sides.

She lies down on the cot in only her panties.

125  INT. TENT - CLOSE SHOT - LANCE, CATHY

They have just finished making love. cathy looks very

pleased. Lance finishes tying his boots -- she draws on

his back. He gets up -- starts to leave.

He leaves -- she pulls herself up and starts combing her

hair -- Mr. Clean walks in.

She shrugs.

126  INT. TENT - MED. SHOT - WILLARD, TERRI

He finishes tying on his boots -- pulls on his jacket --

his gun belt and picks up his M-16. She looks up at him --

She picks up a shoe to throw at him. he turns, exits f.g.

The SHOE CLANGS off his helmet.

127  EXT. THE P.B.R. APPROACHING DO LUNG BRIDGE - FULL SHOT -

The boat edges in toward the wrecked bridge in the

distance. Along the banks are sandbagged fortificvations

with U.S. soldiers in them. There is a bright fire

burning uncontrolled in the distance; the sparks and white

light from welding on the bridge momentarily lights up the

night.

128  VIEW ON THE FACES OF THE P.B.R. CREW

watching. Everywhere are wrecked boats -- parts of trunks

sticking out of the water -- smashed helicopters on the

banks. The bridge is in a state of siege. Mortars and

rockets arc through the night indiscriminately and rip

through the nearby jungle. Soldiers are everywhere --

scurrying from trenches, carrying materials for the bridge

or tending to the wounded, the maimed and the dead. Light

automatic WEAPON FIRE is HEARD occasionally. The P.B.R.

edges in under the span of the old bridge. Soldiers run

up through the water. They are obscured in the darkness.

The Soldier ducks back and runs away.

Other men approach the boat. A young LIEUTENANT steps

forward.

He hands up a plastic bag, maximum security markings,

Willard takes it.

He points to the men getting ready to work.

He turns and splashes off into the darkness.

SHELLS WHISTLE OVER and CRASH into the bridge -- MEN SCREAM

in the distance -- the EXPLOSIONS are thunderous.

Willard climbs out with Lance.

Willard nods and they scurry off the bank under the

bridge.

129  MED. SHOT - WILLARD, LANCE

They dash up the embankment and along the barbed wire

on the edge of the road. SHELLS SCREAM overhead, they

don't know where to run.

They dive towards the voice.

130  CLOSE SHOT - TRENCH

They dive in, a SOLDIER is crounched in f.g. holding his

buddy who is crying uncontrollably.

The Soldier doesn't respond.

There is an apparent lull and they dash out along the

road. Suddenly to their right an M-60 STARTS OPENING UP

from a sandbagged emplacement.

They drop and crawl to the slit trench and run up to the

emplacement. Several SOLDIERS man a M-60. One has a

sniper rifle -- another tries to spot for the Gunner.

Willard and Lance edge up along the trench. Willard

trips.

Willard looks down.

They move ahead more carefully. The Gunner BLASTS away

into the night, there is a pile of brass cases about three

feet high next to him. Finally he stops swearing to

himself.

He turns and sees it's an officer.

There is a low moaning SCREAM from out in the wire -- it

stops for aminute then continues hideously.

The Spotter does, it arcs up, then bathes them in eerie

light. The Gunner FIRES a long BURST.

They think about this as the flare goes out. The SCREAMING

gets more intense.

The Spotter moves down to where a tall lanky SOLDIER is

leaned up against the trench. He kicks him hard several

times. Roach wakes and just looks up. On his helmet are

the words: "GOD BLESS DOW."

He listens, he does, he nods.

Roach gets up somewhat annoyed but very cool. He saunters

up the machine gun dragging his M-79 which has paisley

designs all over it.

He opens the breech of his shotgun-like weapon and plunks

the big slug into it. He snaps it closed then rests it

across his forearm over the trench -- he listens to the

SCREAM, calculating.

He adjusts his sights so that the gun is aimed high into

the air. He listens again then FIRES. The GRENADE

WHISTLES off into the night. There is a sharp EXPLOSION

that cuts off the scream. Then the THUD of bodies or

pieces of bodies coming down around them.

He staggers back down the trench to go to sleep.

131  FULL SHOT - P.B.R. - BRIDGE - CLEAN, CHEF

They stand in the shallows waiting for Willard and Lance.

Clean is nervous, he constantly checks his M-16. SHELLS

WHISTLE by and CRASH in the distance.

A SOLDIER comes up on his way with some others to start

building the bridge.

He takes out a handful of crumpled envelopes.

He puts them in Clean's hand.

He points up at the mountain ridges.

He grabs Clean and looks at him with a maniacal urgency.

Clean takes the letters.

The Soldier looks at him as if he is joking.

The Soldier doesn't answer, just stares dumbfounded.

He takes the letters and leaves, somewhat disappointed and

disgusted. Willard and Lance come back down the beach

carrying some belts of ammunition and a couple of extra

M-16's.

132  FULL SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE - P.B.R.

They edge through the shallows as the men light up their

welding torches to start work on the pontoon bridge --

then pull away and accelerate fast.

133  MED. SHOT - THE P.B.R. CREW

The Chief is at the helm --  they all look back in the

distance where the bridge was -- the hills flash with

artillery discharges -- there is a fiery glow from the

bridge area and the CONCUSSION of heavy EXPLOSIONS.

134  EXT. FULL SHOT - P.B.R. - CREW - RAIN

The boat moves uneasily upriver, through this tropical

downpour. Mr. Clean is in thef.g., oiling and cleaning

his 50-cal, his M-11 and M-79 -- the rest of the crew are

forward, taking shelter from the rain under the canvas

canopy. Clean works methodically under an umbrella he was

set up by leaning the surfboard against gun mount.

135  EXT. THE RUSHING RIVER - NEW VIEW - RAIN

The river is moving fast against them. all manner of de-

bris; tree trunks, sweeping by the P.B.R.

There is a loud CRACKING SOUND, as one of the pieces of

tree- trunk whacks the hull, and bounces off. Willard

climbs forward, and looks down.

Willard practically hangs off forward with a long pole,

warding off the big debris moving toward the P.B.R. Clean

joins him, helping.

Willard points his pole in the direction of the mouth

of a tributary.

There is a really loud WHACK against the hull. willard

really mad, throws the pole at the Chief, who ducks.

It's clear that Willard will kill the Chief if he doesn't

do as he says.

The P.B.R. navigates through the rush and into the mouth

of the tributary.

136  EXT. THE TRIBUTARY - P.B.R. - RAIN

Rain is pouring down, but the P.B.R. is slowed down to a

snail's pace by Hyacinths, literally across the

waterway.

Willard, Chef and Clean in the water, cutting through

them with machetes.

ting, and is staring into the jungle.

He looks out -- the jungle at this point is very dark

and high -- totally impenetrable.

They work feverishly, knowing something is wrong.

139  VIEW ON CHEF

cutting with all he's got.

Chef stops again, looks hard, trying to penetrate the

darkness and from the very depth of it -- the darkness of

it, comes a stream of tracers, lazily arching out at them.

It whips between them -- the SOUND FOLLOWING much later.

Other BULLETS SMASH through and ricochet off the deck

fittings. GLASS SHATTERS, and a huge hunk of paint is

removed from the armor shield by a 20 mm cannon.

Lance leaps down to his position. Willard, Clean and Chef

cut feverishly, as the trapped boat struggles to get free.

Everything is confusion -- yelling -- GUNFIRE -- the THUD

of heavy BULLETS ripping inti the P.B.R.'s fibreglass hull.

140  VIEW ON LANCE

Lance's twin guns return the FIRE. The Chief moves to one

of the heavy guns and joins Lance in returning the FIRE.

142  MED. VIEW

Nobody really knows where the erratic fire is coming from.

Lance grits his teeth, FIRING --

143  CLOSE SHOT ON CLEAN

144  POV BEHIND CLEAN

He BLASTS short bursts of tracers into the jungle, cutting

it to salad. Suddenly more tracers from another direction

-- Clean swings around -- BULLETS smash against his shield

and rip chunks from the surfboard. He BLASTS a long heavy

burst at the jungle -- trees crumble.

Clean is riddled by MACHINE GUN FIRE.

Chief runs to Mr. Clean -- it is obvious that he is dead.

He looks angrily to Willard.

Willard and Chef are practically through. Willard leaps

up, as Chef finishes the last strokes. He moves toward

the cockpit.

Chef throws him an M-79 and several shells -- Willard

opens it, jams a huge projectile and pulls himself over

the edge of the cockpit.

BULLETS rip by.

He climbs aboard and collapses.

He jams his gun up as he sees a flash and FIRES -- there

is a low POP and a WHISTLE as the GRENADE arches into the

jungle.

145  POV. - BEHIND THEM

He FIRES another burst as the GRENADE EXPLODES brightly.

There is another POP and WHISTLE , another BLAST. A large

tree falls, just as the craft speeds up through the thin-

ning growth. We HEAR strange SCREAMING from the trees and

jungle, hideous MOANS and terror-filled CRIES.

146  CLOSE SHOT ON THE CHIEF

He jams the throttle forward -- the boat surges ahead.

Willard FIRES another GRENADE from his M-79.

147  FULL SHOT ON THE P.B.R.

The boat slams through the hyacinth growth, moving through

the river, FIRING BACK at unseen enemy in the jungle.

148  FULL VIEW ON THE P.B.R. - TWILIGHT

The boat moves ahead at half speed through a wide, flat

area in the river.

149  MED. VIEW

The men sit around, exhausted, brutalized, wounded.

They look like animals, but they are relaxed, be-

cause they know they're too far from the banks to

be shot at.

They smoke pot and eat silently. Lance smokes a

joint and looks at his gun. Splotches of paint

have been blown away from the armor shield -- pieces

of deck are ripped and ragged around the mount.

The boat is a floating wreck.

Clean's body is being prepared in a plastic sack

by Chief. All of the men are silent.

Chef comes up from below; he has been wounded in the

shoulder.

Chief has been silent by the body of Clean in a plastic

to be on the dock of an overgrown plantation building.

154  VIEW ON WILLARD, CHIEF

Seems to be some figures standing on the dock. The

figures pull back behind some drums.

156  BACK TO SCENE

They duck as SHOTS RING OUT from the dock, stitching the

water across the P.B.R.'s bow. The crew crouches, guns

trained on the dock as the boat still approaches.

Another BURST, closer.

Willard stares at the dock and building, trying to figure

it out.

Chief hands the loud-hailer to Chef, who shrugs and shouts:

Silence.

We drift closer to the dock. The Chef starts enjoying

speaking French.

There is silence as the boat drifts closer. Then:

They do.

160  FULL SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE - DOCK

The men on the dock move forward, cautiously. They are

a young man, PHILIPPE, about 25, strong and handsome, save

for a scar down on the side of his face and through his left

eye, which is covered by a patch. He is dressed in a

tiger suit and the red beret of the French colonial para-

troops. Also of the red beret are HENRY LeFEVRE, a bear-

ded, dark-looking man of 35, and TRAN VAN KAC, a middle-

aged half-breed slave. They all bear automatic weapons

and suspicious in their eyes. As the boat pulls up to the

dock, another Frenchman joins the group, obviously the

head man, GASTON De MARAIS, about fifty, small and deli-

cate, with a strength about him.

Philippe moves to another position -- Kac grabs the rope

from the deck and ties it to the dock.

Gaston looks at the skyward pointed twin fifties admiringly.

He puts down his gun -- the others do likewise --

Then he motions to the trees. A young man in a tiger suit

and three women come forward from different positions --

all wear bush clothing and bear weapons.

161  CLOSE SHOT - CHRISTIAN

He carries an M-60 machine gun in his hand -- a belt of

ammunition trailing off behind him.

A tall girl, goodlooking, but severe -- she carries an

M-16.

an attractive girl about eighteen. She wears a red

paratrooper beret and a well-fitted bush suit. She carries

an M-79 grenade launcher and plenty of ammunition.

163  FULL VIEW - P.B.R. - CREW, GASTON, OTHERS

They stand there, exhausted and amazed. Philippe yells

in Vietnamese -- about a dozen native men in tiger suits,

heavily armed, walk out of the trees from all around them.

They look the Americans over warily and assemble at

Philippe's command.

Willard's men look at one another, dazed.

Willard steps off -- then stops, reaches back and picks

up his M-16 by the stock.

The men are relieved. They pick up their weapons and

follow.

They look at each other a moment. The Chief shrugs

and follows.

164  FULL SHOT - PLANTATION - WILLARD, GASTON, OTHERS

Gaston stops, points to a guest house off the main struc-

ture which is a typical jungle plantation house, save the

many sandbagged gun emplacements and barbed wire.

He indicates that the men should follow Philippe. The

Chief is hesitant.

Philippe leads them on, muttering.

Willard follows -- they walk over past the house and toward

the jungle, approaching a huge crater, 100 feet across and

about thirty feet deep. The bottom is filled with water and

young French and Vietnamese children swim in it. On the

opposite rim, sit two men and a woman with machine guns.

Gaston strides up and looks down at the crater with pride.

Willard looks.

Gaston stands in serious admiration for this feat; Willard

looks between him and this big hole in the ground in

amezement.

165  INT. WORKMEN'S SHOWER - EVENING

A foreman's shower from the old plantation days. The

Chief steps out of it, refreshed, though still exhausted.

Lance stands there, about to step in, absolutely filthy,

caked with blood. His reaction is odd; rather than just

stepping into the shower, he seems almost frightened,

reluctant to step in. Chef is waiting behind him.

He pushes him forward into the water. The dirt and

caked mud go swirling off his face and shoulders, and

he relaxes as though he suddenly remenbers what a

shower is.

166  EXT. THE DOCK - P.B.R. - EVENING

battered and torn -- a few of Philippe's Vietnamese

guard at the boat.

167  INT. WILLARD'S QUARTERS - EVENING

A beautiful European room with tall ceilings. Still

elegantly furnished, although old and decaying.

Willard sits in a comfortable chair in the corner of

the room, looking out over the carpet,  the bed with

its elegant spread; the wash basin; the bidet. His

battle dress is black with muck, with bloodstaines and

burns.

He rises from the chair and steps to a dresser above

which is a large mirror. There is an album on the

marble top of the dresser. He turns to a page at random.

mirror. He barely recognizes himself.

173  MED. VIEW

Willard looks at himself in the mirror, in this odd, out-

of-time room.

174  INT. DINING ROOM GROUP - TRACKING SHOT

TRACK DOWN the long table, covered with delicious food.

The P.B.R. crew sits with others of the De Marais group.

The table is headed by St. LeFevre. Chef's face lights

up as he regards the wonderful European-style food.

Opposite the table, sitting next to the Chief, Lance

reaches hungrily for bread and other food with his hands.

And then he looks to his friends for approval.

Our VIEW REVEALS that behind a transparent silk curtain

there is another, more elaborate table, where the

De Marais family is dining with Willard. Our VIEW MOVES

through the curtain and settles in a MEDIUM VIEW of the

group.

The men rise as a very attractive woman enters the room.

Willard finally does as well, and she moves to the chair

next to him.

She sits -- there's an uneasy silence.

Willard is caught with this exotic woman on one side of

him, and the ongoing conversation on the other. He is

forced to face toward Gaston, and drawn to look at Roxanne.

Philippe turns around, points to an elaborately scripted

wooden plaque with various tallies on it.

He gets up, and leaves abruptely -- followed by his wife.

There is a pause.

Gaston rises, and takes Roxanne's hand.

Willard turns.

Gaston leaves. Willard and Roxanne are left alone. The

servants clear the table.

She walks out of the room.

He follows.

175  INT. SITTING ROOM - FULL SHOT - WILLARD AND ROXANNE

Roxanne sits, pouring a brandy, while Willard stands.

She reaches out to him; indicating that he sit.

A long pause. Then she looks at the cognac she poured for

him.

She takes a sip.

Willard moves to the French doors, which have been left

partly open to let a breeze in. He steps onto a terrace

overlooking the river.

176  EXT. THE TERRACE - MED. VIEW - WILLARD - NIGHT

A machine gun emplacement is situated on the terrace cover-

ing the front of house, from the river.

In fact, we REALIZE that he is checking the boat.

177  WILLARD'S POV.

The P.B.R. is under guard by a couple of Gaston's

Vietnamese.

176  MED. VIEW ON WILLARD, ROXANNE

She, thinking it romantic to talk about the river, comes

up behind him.

She moves her body close to his; and, in a moment, he is

kissing her.

179  CLOSE ON WILLARD, ROXANNE

One eye steals another look at the P.B.R.

Two of the guards leave -- two remain, getting ready

for the long night.

181  VIEW ON WILLARD, ROXANNE - ON THE TERRACE

His hands wander over her body as she clings to him. Then

she takes his hand, and leads him back into the sitting

room, and up the stairs.

182  INT. ROXANNE'S ROOM - FULL VIEW

It is dark. She leads him into her room and closes the

door. He stands there. In the center of the room is a

large canopied bed with mosquito netting hanging down over

it. The windows also have netting and barbed wire --

there is a .30 calibre machine gun mount in the far one.

He look around. she goes over to the bed, and turns

down the sheets. Then she slips out of her dress and

stands there facing him.

He puts down his gun and strips off his shirt. She lays

down on the bed and watches him.

He moves to her, slipping into the bed. M-16 is

leaning against the wall in his reach.

183  EXT. ROXANNE'S TERRACE - NIGHT

We can VIEW into the room, as Willard has silently

slipped out of her bed, and is a dark sinister figure

kneeling in final preparations for going out in the

night.

Without a sound, he comes out to the terrace, and

scales down the wall of the old building, disappearing

into the darkness.

184  EXT. THE DOCK - P.B.R. - NIGHT

Two Vietnamese guard the P.B.R. -- suddenly, feet first,

the first disappears into the thicket.

185  CLOSE VIEW ON WILLARD

in the thicket; we realize he has just killed the man with

a knife. Willard stalks the second guard and makes quick

work of him with his knife. He even enjoys it. Silently,

he drags the body out of sight.

186  MED. VIEW ON THE P.B.R.

The dark figure boards the boat silently. He disappears

into the hold.

187  NEW VIEW

He lifts out several cases of supplies, working quickly,

with a grace that indicates he is a man who has done his

best work alone, and at night.

188  INT. ROXANNE'S ROOM - CLOSE SHOT - WILLARD - MORNING

He sleeps soundly alone in the bed - we HEAR SOMEONE

moving around in the room. He wakes suddenly -- PULL

BACK TO REVEAL Roxanne combing her hair and buttoning up

her blouse. She notices he is awake and smiles.

He starts to get up.

He stops -- seemingly stunned.

She turns to go.

She leaves.

189  EXT. DOCK - FULL SHOT - WILLARD, OTHERS

He walks down onto the dock. Gaston's men are transferring

ammunition boxes.

Gaston is standing with Philippe, who are covering the

Chief and crew with M-16's.

He pauses for a second.

The Chief spits in the water disgustedly and starts the

engines. Willard looks hard at Gaston.

190  LONG SHOT - DOCK - P.B.R.

Willard climbs on board and it pulls away.

191  EXT. P.B.R. - MED. SHOT - WILLARD, CHIEF

The BOAT ROARS out across the river. The Chief looks over

at Willard. They stare at each other for a moment.

Willard just smiles at the Chief. he leans over and pulls

up a floorboard -- the men stare in amezement; it contains

the contents of all those ammo boxes.  .50 calibre; clips;

grenades.

He lets the board drop.

Willard moves to the back of the boat.

192  FULL SHOT - P.B.R. - RIVER , CREW

The river has narrowed and runs swifter -- the water dark

and deep. The trees are higher in this area and much of

the river is shaded on one side. There is no undergrowth,

just the tall trees and ferms. They move ahead at half

speed, alert, ready for anything.

Willard looks out ahead and points.

They all turn their guns in that direction. We PAN TO

REVEAL a small village of huts along the bank.

193  FULL SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE - VILLAGE

194  POV. OF THE P.B.R.

They pass in front of the village which is rundown and

completely deserted. The huts are on stilts to avoid the

flooding of the river -- they are just skeletons of what

they once were.

195  POV BOAT - FULL SHOT - JUNGLE

The canopy of trees grows taller and stretches out across

the river filtering the sun. The forest itself has grown

darker and more twisted with ferns and creepers. Strange

birds fly out of the trees as the boat passes -- a huge

snake slips along an overheading limb. The depth of the

jungle is dark, ominous -- yet cool and strangely inviting.

196  FULL SHOT - BOAT - JUNGLE

Suddenly the river widens, the trees give way to marsh

and as they emerge into the light a strange shadow falls

upon the boat. It is the shadow cast by an enormous

vertical tail section of a B-52 bomber thrusting out from

the mud. Pieces of aluminum hang loosely from it, oxi-

dizing in the sun. Creepers have already started to grow

up around its heights -- the jungle is claiming it. But

once under its shadow, they have passed a gateway. A

gateway to paradise.

The river widens and the trees at its edge are soft and

seductive. The hills beyond are purple and lush. Strange

orange colored water-fowl swim lazily out of their way.

The water itself is glass smooth and black as if there

were no bottom. The sun is warm and the breeze gentle

and laced with wild gardenians. It is indeed the most

peaceful valley in all the world and each man looks upon

it and has never known such a sense of peace and well-

being.

Each man in his heart feels a need to stay -- his soul

cries to stop -- stop their madness -- this spiral into

hell.

Here is all that can be had of earth. But no hand moves.

The boat drifts on its own toward a hole at the end of

the clearing. A hole into the jungle from which a

darkness permeats. The boat follows the river into this

hole.

197  FULL SHOT - P.B.R. - RIVER - DAWN

The skull looms in the f.g. -- the P.B.R. is pulled back

about seventy yards -- Early morning mist still hangs on

the water -- as it clears, we SEE another post and skulls

on the opposite bank, It is strangely quiet.

Lance's TWIN FIFTIES split the silence as they POUR into

the skulls on the opposite bank -- Suddenly there is a

tremendous EXPLOSION and SECONDARY ONES from the jungle

as shrapnel rips into the jungle and water from CLAYMORE

MINES obviously set to cover the mound of skulls. The

smoke clears.

There is silence.

Willard motions -- the Chief accelerates -- they move ahead

past the smoking mound.

198  EXT. THE RIVER - FOG - DAY

The P.B.R. pushed deeper into this mysterious area. Mist

swells in and around the river, as the boat moves into

an obscure fog. The Chief cuts the engine, and they coast.

The boat disappears in the thick fog.

199  MED. CLOSE ON WILLARD

We catch glimpses of him, even though we are close.

They are silent. We can HEAR the most ominous SOUND

A glimpse of him, almost in tears. We then SEE glimpses,

fog moving, of all the men on the P.B.R.

MOVING THROUGH the thinning mist. The Navy craft proceeds

cautiously.

The P.B.R. moves toard the right-most channel. Chef

takes a long pole and begins sounding depth.

205  VIEW ON WILLARD

The men are really tense now -- Lances swivels his gun from

bank to bank. Chief keeps his fingers on an M-16. Willard

takes out the TOP SECRET packet he received at Do Lung.

Tears it open. We MOVE IN ON him.

Suddenly Chef lays out flat on the bow. Hundreds

and hundreds of slender sticks fly onto the P.B.R.

rattling against the boat.

206  CLOSE ON WILLARD

they've got. Lance is FIRING the two fifties wildly.

But Chief seems out of control -- he lets the clip of his

M-16 go. Then slowly lets the rifle fall out of his hands,

and falls to Willard's feet, a primitive spear having

caught him right through the ribs. Willard looks down in

horror.

210  VIEW ON CHIEF

He dies.

long after those who attacked beat their retreat.

Slowly he pulls his boots from under Chief. They are

absolutely soaked in blood. He is stunned -- sits down

and begins to unlace the bloody boots, and take them off.

Willard unlaces the other boot, and holds the bloody boot

in his hand.

He starts to wipe the blood off the boot.

212  EXT. THE BOAT AT MARINA DEL REY - NIGHT

The people at Charlie's cocktail party on the boat.

Some flashbulbs are going off. Some people are dancing

to the MUSIC. OUR VIEW MOVES SLOWLY TOWARD Willard, on

the edge of the party.

213  EXT. THE RIVER - P.B.R. DAY

The P.B.R. moving up the river. The men are practically

in a trance now, looking at the banks of the river. They

don t even make an effort to touch their weapons.

214  WHAT THEY SEE

Hundreds and hundreds of Montagnard natives -- dressed

in the most ornate and primitive manner: feathers, parts

of birds and animals; cod-pieces -- all in body and face

paint of the most savage nature. But there is a purity

about them, men and boys, standing passively watching

the small Navy craft flying the strange flag of red,

white and blue.

215  VIEW ON THE P.B.R.

The men of the crew are not the same men who began this

voyage. Their manner is lifeless as though in a trance.

The various decorations and paraphenelia that they have

picked up along the way seem oddly relevant to the

savages that stand before them. The Chef has made a

hat of birdfeathers; Lance's face has been painted with

mud under the eyes to block the glare of the sun. He

wears certain animal skins; trinkets; some animal teeth.

Their uniforms have been torn and patched throughout the

difficult journey. They start to move to their gun

positions.

216  VIEW FROM BEHIND THE P.B.R.

MOVING SLOWLY TOWARD the fantastic human wall of feathers

and war paint, standing on canoes across the river. The

men on the crew stand in a group, their hands visibly

without weapons. The natives standing across the river

make no hostile gestures as they approach. They accept

the small boat moving toward them with a sort of inevi-

tability. The boat moves closer, approaches the wall of

feathers -- which slowly and automatically gives away, in

almost a ritual of birth, undulating, allowing the little

boat to penetrate.

217  VIEW ON WILLARD

Mus on his face (to protect it from the sun), the palms

of some jungle vegetation protecting his head, he looks

something like atribal chieftan himself. His intuition

was right. He senses that they would be allowed to pass.

218  FULL VIEW ON THE RIVER

Hundreds of Montagnards who had been lining the river

now run, absolutely silently, along the banks, keeping

pace with the P.B.R. There is no hostility in these

faces, only curiosity and a sort of grief.

water's edge where there is a dock covered with concertina

wire. The odd Australian stands waving his hat, guiding

them safely in.

A thick greasy smoke hangs from fires that burn near the

fort; fresh shell craters indicate a recent battle. Near

the dock there is a tangled clump of corpses -- half sub-

merged in the water. Other piles of bodies lie about, some

of them on fire. Fire literally burns from out of the

Moonby nods and shrugs, and hops off the P.B.R. willard

and the men follow.

228  MOVING VIEW - WILLARD, MOONBY AND THE CREW

As they proceed closer to the fortress-temple, men appear

where a moment before there was only jungle.

They are mostly Montagnards, but far more savage looking

than any we've seen before. They wear only loinclothes

and bandoliers of ammunition. their bodies are painted

in strange patterns. They carry Army M-16's, Russian

AK-47's and a wide variety of knives and clubs. Women

emerge from the brush as well. they are armed and

equally primitive looking. Interspersed among them

are a few taller men with paler skins, with the remnants

of Army insignia on them. The paint on their bodies is,

if anything more bizarre. We CONTINUE TO MOVE ACROSS

the entire group up to the stone gates of the fort,

where thirty or so more are seen silhouetted against

the sky. Willard and his men look up at people more

primitive and more savage than any since the time

of Captain Cook.

They encounter, in the center of the group, what once

appears to have been an American. he is tall, gaunt,

wears a flak jacket, but is otherwise naked, save a

loincloth. His face is darkened from dirt, battle smoke,

strange camouflage patterns. His hair and beard are

long, matted with mud and grease. He carries an AK-47

decorated with scalps and human ears. Willard approaches

this beast, who seems shy and retiring.

Moonby shuts up. The MAN tries to speak, but nothing

comes out. He is dumbstrucked at seeing them, as they

are to see him.

Willard is the man in the middle -- he doesn't know what

to say to this man, but he understands the forces that

pounded him. He takes his arm.

229  REVERSE ON COLBY

looks at Willard, not understanding.

230  REVERSE ON WILLARD

Six months later, and he and Colby would be identical.

Moonby slaps himself in the head with his hand.

Colby starts, and then, seeing the shrunken heads on

poles, he turns, agitated, to Willard:

Suddenly, frightened, he stops. Without looking Willard

knows that Kurtz is standing behind him. He turns.

Kurtz has stepped out from his headquarters: He is

a powerful man, though obviously very ill. He slowly

attempts to pull the remnants of his uniform together,

though it is ripped and bloodied, and now combined with

primitive ornaments designating him a tribal chief, as

well as his U.S.A. Colonel's insignia. He is feverish,

with long blonde hair and beautiful features. His eyes

almost hypnotize. His midsection is bandaged from what

seems to be a serious wound.

232  VIEW ON WILLARD

This is not what he expected. He is quiet, and then,

automatically, he comes to an attention.

There is, of course, no chair or anything like a chair.

But behind and around him, Kurtz's men begin to sit on

the ground, cross-legged. Finally, Willard sits as well.

Then Kurtz does.

Moonby lights a joint, and passes it respectfully to

Kurtz -- throughout the scene, the joint is passed from

man to man, ritualistically.

There is a clear, incredible intelligence about this man.

235  CLOSE ON WILLARD

He remains silent.

236  CLOSE ON KURTZ

He smiles.

There is a long pause,  as the two men regard each other.

Then Willard reaches to his holstered .45 -- withdraws

it, and places it on the dirt before Kurtz, as an act

assuring Kurtz that he is not an assasin.

Kurtz reaches down; takes the .45 -- and without another

word or gesture, shoots and kills a man.

?

He throws the .45 back on the dirt. Rises, and walks

back into the cavernous headquarters behind the shrunken

heads. Moonby scampers off after him, a respectful

distance behind. Even Willard is stunned.

237  EXT. KURTZ'S OUTPOST - FULL VIEW - TWILIGHT

Dotted with campfires; Montagnard families -- it is like

a primitive civilization.

238  VIEW BY THE TEMPLE WALL

Willard is alone by a campfire -- his M-16 leans by a wall

next to him. He is exhausted.

Lance sleeps by the fire, a little distance away. Chef

approaches, crouches down.

Lance stirs; starts to wake up.

Willard rises. Chef looks at him, confused and frightened.

239  FULL SHOT - WALL - WILLARD, CHEF , LANCE

Willard walks along the top of a thick wall -- sandbagged

and dug out every so often for an M-60 or a mortar

emplacement.

Wild looking savages man these guns, and seem to bow

to Willard as he passes.

A woman tentatively moves to Willard, bowing, and then

runs off to her bunker.

WE ARE TRACKING with them as they move past the groups

of people, huddled by their fires... men, women and

children. Skulls, shrunken and otherwise hang from

every hut -- adorn every sandbagged bunker -- dried

scalps hang from barbed wire. A child is chewing on

a big piece of almost raw meat.

They continue past amount where the shattered wreck of

half a helicopter is laying. It has been altered and

fortified with sandbags and concertina wire. The wreck

lays on its side so that a 7.62 mini-gun that was mounted

there sticks up above the sandbags. The emplacement is

built on amound so the gun commands a clear field of

fire into the jungle beyond.

Some Americans, barely recognizible because of their

beards and savage manner, sit near the gun. Several

Montagnard children giggle at their feet and play with

bayonets.

Lance just stands there; his eyes vacant.. He sort of

nods, sucking a joint.

He thinks.

240  INT. KURTZ HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

VIEW FROM INSIDE -- Willard approaches the stakes with

the shrunken heads. Chef and Lance with him. Willard

steps in -- Lance and the Chef crouch outside, waiting.

241  WILLARD'S VIEW

An austere stone savern in the temple: Kurtz's head-

quarters. Electric lights hanging in odd contrast to the

ancient stone. We SEE what is left of the maps and other

military charts -- they had been tacked up on big boards,

but have now fallen into decayed disuse.

There are other indications of the modern headquarters

this had been. Now all those things are no longer impor-

tant.  Kurtz sits alone, slumped back in a wicker chair.

There is a large wooden planning table next to him, with

maps, lamps and apile of debris that is practically

garbage. There are native decorations to ward off evil

spirits; and graffiti on the stone walls, things ranging

fromm "Viet Nam, love it or leave it" to quotes of Nietzsche

"Nothing is true -- everything is permitted."

Moonby, who had been crouching in a corner, moves to

Willard.

Willard steps in closer. Kurtz looks to Moonby.

Moonby hesitates -- not wanting to leave him alone with

Willard.

That's rich. We fight

Willard shrugs.

He rests back, grinning.

Suddenly Kurtz is seized with a terrible pain from his

stomach wound. He groans horribly, clutching at it. He

literally falls from his chair onto the dirt floor.

Willard leans over him; checking the seriousness of the

wound.

Lance is crouching by the stone entrance -- Chef leans in,

witnessing the proceedings inside.

Willard quickly prepares another shot. Kurtz, truly

frightened, holds up his hand.

FIRE. Chef is being riddled by bullets.

246  VIEW ON LANCE

He has let loose with his M-16 at Chef, like some sort

of mindless, programmed killer.

Then hes tops -- Chef falls to the dirt -- there is an

instant of silence, then:

247 EXT. OF THE TEMPLE AT NU MUNG BA - NIGHT

The DOORS begin LIGHT MY FIRE , loud and overwhelming,

as illuminating flares light up the blackness.

248  MED. CLOSE VIEW

of enormous loudspeakers protected behind spirals of

razor-sharp concertina wire. LIGHT MY FIRE is blasted

out to the enemy, poised to attack.

249  ANOTHER LOUDSPEAKER

Cannibal-painted men in savage decorations wait. Bay-

onets are fixed. Men are stoned to acid, injecting

speed, sniffing cocaine, eating grass, smoking hashish

in water pipes. One looks up to the sky.

250  EIS VIEW

A rocket illuminates the sky, strobing, as in a psyche-

delic hallucination.

251  VIEW ON THE SOLDIER

Another behind him is chanting the word NAPALM softly t

himself.

252  MED. VIEW ON THE GATE

Willard strides out of the darkness, into the positions

around the gate. He looks like a magnificent warrior --

Genghis. All the men: Montagnards, fierce Americans,

even the savage men of the P.B.R. crew either bow,

salute or kneel before Willard. The color pulsates

around the edge of the image, red and green, mauve and

purple.

We SEE Lance; waiting, with his weapons -- garlands of

teeth around his neck, his face painted.

253  FULL VIEW - MONTAGE

Enemy ARTILLERY BLASTING away at the fortress.

254  CLOSE SHOT - A MORTAR

A hand drops a shell and it FIRES.

255  CLOSE SHOT - ROCKET LAUNCHER

It FIRES. EXPLOSIONS around the fort, red and orange

and blue and green. They hit and grow, outward like some

sort of cosmic flower.

256  CLOSE SHOT - A FLAME-THROWER (ON TANK)

Shoots out a stream of burning napalm that looks like a

death ray gun, radiating outward with ice-blue energy.

257  SHOT ON LOUDSPEAKERS

blasting out music.

258  MED. CLOSE VIEW ON YOUNG SOLDIERS

With the MUSIC, like those people you see listening to

radios in their cars.

259  SHOT ON THE COMMAND BUNKER - WILLARD , KURTZ , OTHERS

(In SLOW MOTION) Shells WHISTLE in and EXPLODE on the

walls in the compound. The men behind them are setting

up rocket launcher (missile) . Everywhere metal and rock

and flame fly and it is beautiful to see.

Willard looks through the infra-red sniper scope.

260  WILLARD - INFRA-RED POV

Strange, luminescent images of North Vietnamese approach-

ing the outer perimeters. Thousands of them.

261  FULL SHOT ON KURTZ

262  MED. SHOT - MINI-GUN

A SERGEANT in feathered head-piece and wildly painted

operates the mini-gun with several native helpers. SHELLS

BURST  around them. When they FIRE the SOUND is incredibly

loud and steady like a high-pitched foghorn. A solid

stream of molten lead seems to pour into the darkness as

7000 rounds a minute rip into the enemy. The pass of

the lead reaches out in beautiful patterns as the Ser-

geant sweeps the area. The sergeant laughs maniacally

as the GUN resumes FIRING, right up to the moment he is

blown to eternity by an all-engulfing 105mm shell.

263  VIEW ON WILLARD

Exhilarated, and moving with the MUSIC.

Colby pushes a row of plungers: Advancing NVAs il-

luminated by napalm drums, phosphorescent napalm EXPLODES

beautiful, like a magnificent firework.

264  VIEW ON KURTZ

The SOUND DISTORTED of tremendous HOWLING EXPLOSIONS

penetrate the track of LIGHT MY FIRE one after another.

Kurtz's face is illuminated by each of these. His face

seems to change from one grotesgue primitive face to

another, as though the whole history mankind is evolv-

ing in front of us.

The SCREAMS of maimed and dismembered men almost pene-

trates the INCREDIBLY LOUD MUSIC and we HEAR Kurtz's men

LAUGHING and SCREAMING in delight.

Kurtz looks out over the field of slaughter.

265  FULL SHOT - NVA CHARGE

through wires and claymore glass, each wilder and more

extreme. They burn in the pools of luminescent napalm

but press relentlessly on. SHELL BURSTS overhead. They

chant to themselves as they advance. NVA have reached

the walls and throw down scaling ladders and start up.

Suddenly the sky is bright with flares which produce

weird psychedelic light. Blared out at tremendous vol-

ume over and above the DIN OF BATTLE is LIGHT MY FIRE.

266  FULL SHOT - WALL - EVERYBODY

The Americans and Montagnards stand up screaming.

Spurred by MUSIC, they charge up. M-16's in both hands,

blasting, kicking, bayoneting, gouging, splittin throats,

biting necks, both sides collide in the utter and most

horrible savagery.

267  MED. SHOT - WILLARD

standing on the wall BLASTING as bodies fall around him;

he thrusts his bayonet into one attacker, removes it with

a foot and stabs another. From him he takes his AK47 and

BLASTS more as they come.

268  MED. SHOT - LANCE

The VC rush his position. Willard trips a claymore that

BLASTS most of them to shreads. More fill in. Lance

opens up FULL AUTOMATIC . Willard and Lance move down to

the nest wall, FIRING , bodies tumbling over.

Lance is caught in a CROSSFIRE and hit several times.

He pulls himself up -- FIRES a final BURST and then falls

under the enemy's feet.

269  VIEW ON MOONBY

sees this and scampers off into the jungle, muttering

madly to himself.

270  MED. VIEW - WILLARD AT THE R.T.

shouting into the radio

He turns and runs back through the compound with the

receding Montagnards. SHELLS are EXPLODING everywhere.

The light patterns are fantastic. Men fall, Viets break

over the walls and charge. They crouch and rip into

them FULL AUTOMATIC. They break the charge and continue

cutting their way through the NVA masses like torches

through metal.

271  FULL SHOT - COMMAND POST - KURTZ

Kurtz watches as invaders swarm through his domain. Women

and children rush upon him now. Kurtz flicks some switch-

es and the whole north wall EXPLODES in overwhelming FIRE.

The gates are uprooted. The stone lions tumble, crushing

men below. Kurtz cocks an M-16 and walks off the bunker.

272  VIEW ON WILLARD

watching this spectacle.

273  MED. SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE - KURTZ

He rounds  the shadow wall.

Kurtz sees a group of Viets and rushes up and prepares a

machine gun mount. They don't see him. He braces the gun

at his side and steps out.

They stagger and fall, shattered and bleeding, save one

who's merely lost his weapon. Kurtz looks at him, his

gun empty. He drops it and flips open the flap of his

holster. The Viet soldier goes for his pistol. Kurtz

beats him to the draw and bloes him into the night. He

moves over to pick up the NVA light machine gun. Holding

it at his hip, he stands atop one of the ruined walls

and FIRES into the masses. His native men see him and

rush for the chance to die beside him. They are quickly

encircled by onrushing Viets and are being overrun. The

machine gun jams and Kurtz grabs a rifle. When it's empty

and the bayonet is off he wields it as a club.

274  MED. SHOT - LOW ANGLE - KURTZ

taking swings with his rifle, standing atop the

wall and battering the oncoming enemy like Davy Crockett

at the Alamo.

275  FULL VIEW - THE FORTRESS

The air strike hits with all its force. Balls and rain

of fire sweeps down on the temple, the enemy, everything.

It is the biggest firework show in history.

The wall Kurtz was standing on, and he falls with it.

Willard sees this and makes his way toward him as the

air strike continues. All around us is a spectacle of

MUSIC and light and fire and overwhelming color.

276  TRACKING SHOT ON WILLARD

following Kurtz's trail in the mud. He has crawled on

all fours back into the jungle to die. He stalks Kurtz

into the jungle ; moving around and cutting off the

crawling Kurtz

Willard slings Kurtz's bleeding body around his neck,

holding his hand, dragging hom through the jungle. The

spectacle continues in the b.g.

277  EXT. THE P.B.R. - THE RIVER

This wreck of a boat is still afloat. Willard crawls

out of the jungle, carrying the dying Kurtz and manages

to get him onto the boat.

278  EXTREME FULL SHOT

The spectacle of total psychedelic war: the fortress of

Nu Mung Ba.

FADE IN.

279  EXT. THE TEMPLE - MORNING

The entire temple is devastation. Vultures by the hundreds

circle overhead. There are a few survivors. Everywhere

is smoke and heaps of bodies. Colby, a Sergeant, and

some Montagnards sit near them.

Their eyes are red and glazed, their jaws hang slack and

they tumble occasionally. They stagger away from the

field of slaughter. Willard looks down and sees something.

Moves over to it, kicks several bodies away and in the

f.g. below is Lance, dead.

Colby stumbles over. Willard holds Lance up by his hair.

280  THE P.B.R.

battered, moving slowly down the river.

281  TIGHTER VIEW

Colby is at helm. Kurtz lies feverish, delirious.

Willard sits by him. As the boat moves, Montagnards, those

left alive, come and pay their respects by the riverbanks.

Colby takes an automatic weapon and FIRES it into the air.

Some of the natives move in terror, frightened of him.

The battle is not over.

Willard looks down at him.

Kurtz looks up at him, past him with fury, longing in his

eyes. There is a slight smile.

282  EXT. RIVER - MED. VIEW

The boat moves as though naturally carried by the river.

Kurtz looks up to him, then an expression of overwhelming

intense and hopeless terror, hopeless despair. A whisper

at some image, at some vision, he cries out twice, a cry

that is no more than a breath.

We HEAR the distant SOUND of HELICOPTERS approaching.

The SOUND of ROTORS in the distance. They look up,

craning their eyes at the sky. Colby points.

Over the jungle mountains the small formation of MEDEVAC

helicopters hooping toward them.

The helicopters are closer now but high up. Two of

them breaking off, spiraling in TOWARD US.

283  CLOSE SHOT ON WILLARD

He stares up at the sky.

Copters directly overhead.

He raises his M-16 and FIRES the entire clip at the ap-

proaching rescue helicopter.

284  FULL SHOT - THE COPTER

It frantically pours on the power and wheels up to the

sky.

285  FULL SHOT - WILLARD, COLBY

Colby takes his rifle and joins Willard in FIRING at

the retreating American helicopters.

286  HELICOPTER'S POV - ON THE BOAT

The men in the boat FIRING AT US as we fly further into

the air, the boat getting smaller and smaller.

287  EXT. MARINA DEL RAY - EXTREME HIGH ANGLE - NIGHT

MOVING DOWN back to the pleasure boat at the Marina.

Pause. Willard is very silent.

289  EXT. CALIFORNIA NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

A bright clear day in a scrubbed-clean California neigh-

borhood. Some kids are playing in the street.

Willard, years later, dressed as a civilian, proceeds past

the lawn to the attractive home, carrying a packet under

his arm. He passes a lanky, young teen-aged boy working

on a motor-scooter. Willard looks at him. The boy

looks back.

Then the door opens, and KURTZ'S WIFE is standing at the

door. She is still beautiful, blonde, and dressed in

mourning even though she doesn't wear black. There is a

sense of purity about her, though she is not young.

He enters.

289  INT. KURTZ'S HOME - DAY

Everything good and secure and desirable about America.

She stands in the center of the room, a little nervous.

There are pictures of Kurtz, not too many... but he is

there in the various stages of his career.

Then she sits suddenly, and Willard sits by her.

Pause.

290  MED. CLOSE SHOT ON WILLARD

A little of the madness is still with him. He knows what

she will ask.

291  MED. CLOSE SHOT ON KURTZ'S WIFE

292  MED. CLOSE ON WILLARD

remembering that incredible day moving down the river.

Our VIEW LOOSENS

He sits there looking at her.

293  EXT. TIGHT HIGH ANGLE ON THE MARINA DEL REY BOAT

The cocktail party is breaking up. Willard is one of

the few guests left.

We MOVE FROM Willard standing alone on the deck of the

boat. Moving back through the departing guests. Charlie

is getting ready to leave himself. We MOVE CLOSER to

Willard.

294  EXT. THE RIVER - P.B.R. - DAY

the boat floating down the river. Kurtz's body; an exhaust-

ed, half-dead Colby. And HOLDING Kurtz, Willard. We HEAR

THE DOORS' "THE END" as we present the END TITLES.
