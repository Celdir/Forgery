GONE IN 60 SECONDS

if this sort of car starts easily?"

found that he had hold of the handle and was turning

it. As the familiar sound broke forth, the old

passion seized on Toad and completely mastered him,

body and soul ... He increased his pace, and as the

car devoured the street, he was only conscious

that he was Toad once more, Toad at his best and

highest. And he sped he knew not whither, fulfilling

his instincts, living his hour, reckless of what

might come to him... "

FADE IN:

EXT. LONG BEACH STREET - LOWER GRAND - NIGHT

The streets are empty. Low fog skims the sidewalks below a gray stew

of a sky. It's slightly fuzzy, slightly surreal.  The vast Port of Los

Angeles is visible in the b.g... No cars parked here ... No cars

except -

A '67 SHELBY MUSTANG GT-500

Silver with deep grill, its sculptured side panels ending in air

scoops ... All cock and balls, it stands alone in the lonely cool

before dawn ... An old-school totem to speed and style... And then

SOMEONE approaches...

Through the mists of morning ... In leather coat and jack boots ...

He's early 30s, with the vaguely whimsical confidence of a shimmer

that refuses to fade ...

This is RANDALL RAINES, whom they call MEMPHIS - though know one's

quite sure why ... But they do know he's the auto-boost in Southern

California ...

Memphis approaches the Mustang with a gathering awe ... Like a desert

crash survivor coming upon an oasis ... He walks around it ...

Admiring it ... Adoring it ...

But then a FIREBIRD pulls up alongside him. Its driver -

ATLEY JACKSON, early 30s, handsome, jocular leans out for:

Memphis looks at him, still enthralled...

And Atley drives off slowly, Memphis looks this way and that ...

No one about ... He removes a SLIM JIM from a deep pocket in his

coat... He slims the door panel ... Pops the button ... opens the

door ...

Watch him work. Quick as shit. A SCREWDRIVER appears another

pocket ... He pops the BUTTERFLY to the IGNITION

A RATCHET appears... He strips the mechanism... Now a GIZMO - a,small

socket-like device - is pressed into the

ignition ... A twist of the wrist ... And the 320-bhp 289 V8 rumbles

like a jackhammer. The whole thing took 20 seconds.

He takes a cassette TAPE from another pocket ... Slaps it into the

deck. Bruce Springsteen's "Ramrod" wails from the coaxials.

And Memphis floors it... And off they tear...

The look on his face suggests a supreme satisfaction ... A grand

re-awakening of long-dormant pleasure centers ... A speed Jones,

fixed and fumy ...

He slots in behind Atley Jackson's Firebird ... And slotting in

behind Memphis, in a Z-28, is DONNY ASTRICKY, mid-30s ...

On they go ... The fore and aft car providing escort...

Except that, from seemingly out of nowhere --

A POLICE CAR

appears behind them...

And Donny instantly goes into diversionary tactic ... He races

through a STOP SIGN ... And the cruiser's bubbles flash on ... And

Donny is pulled-over ... Atley and Memphis drive on in their

respective vehicles...

The UNIFORM COP gets out of his car, goes to Donny.

And off of Donny's look --

We go to Memphis in the Shelby... As FOUR CRUISERS comes speeding

toward him, sirens wailing...

QUICK SHOTS of Memphis racing the Shelby through the early morning

harbor town streets ... Sirens peel ... Memphis turns up the music

... Pins the gas ... The chase is on ...

Memphis maneuvers the Mustang with a dazzling aplomb... Memphis

gutterballing the car, skating the shoulder, the cops in heavy

pursuit ...

And now he's picked up another CRUISER... He passes Atley Jackson,

heading in the opposite direction... Atley has picked-up a pair of

cruisers himself ...

Memphis on a straightaway now, speeds up, feels the boost. But up

ahead, a ROADBLOCK has formed... How'd they get that deployed so

fast? And behind him, the unmarks blaze ...

Guns his bitch... Straight at the roadblock .. Three CRUISERS and

a PORTABLE WOODEN BARRICADE... Memphis pins her ... ZOOOOOM! Dead-on

to the roadblock ...

And, at the last moment, as the COPS dive out of the way, Memphis

bangs the gear shift into neutral -- yanks the parking brake --

And the Mustang spins on the straight -- Screeching spin ... And

Memphis takes the HARD LEFT ...

And he's managed to outrun them... Finding himself above Lower

Grand... Looking down ...

He can see the secondary pursuit down below ... Atley being

chased... IN THE DISTANCE - Atley is LAUNCHED FROM THE SHOULDER,

the Firebird rolling down a drainage culvert ...

Landing with a sickening thud on its back. Memphis is horrified.

EXT. LOWER GRAND - LATER

Rescue team presence. Atley being hauled out of the wreck... His

leg is a torn mess ... He's barely conscious... A cuffed Donny

Astricky is dragged to a waiting cruiser ...

A POLICE CAR pulls up ... And out steps

DETECTIVE ROLAND CASTLEBECK

of G.R.A.B. The Governor's Regional Auto-theft Bureau. Castlebeck

is mid-50s, black, saturnine. - But don't let the tacit nobility

fool you - the man's a street viper ...

Castlebeck goes to another cop - HAWKINGS..

Castlebeck looks out over the mess ... And then looks up...

Because, further down Lower Grand, a car is parked. It is the

Shelby. With Memphis leaning against its hood...

Castlebeck looks around him, but no one's noticed. So he walks

toward it, hand on hip...

And they stare at each other, as Castlebeck considers.

And Memphis makes to get into the Shelby...

Memphis nods ... Takes one last look at the Shelby... Sorry to

leave it behind ... And he runs off into the mists of Lower

Grand ...

Castlebeck walks back toward the crime-scene tumult ...

And off of Donny's surprised look, as Springsteen wails to

crescendo and we

EXT. INDEPENDENCE, CALIFORNIA - DAY - 6 YEARS LATER

Some 400 miles North of Los Angeles, Independence is a one

horse town, and the horse has died... Single stop light,

single-engine firehouse, single everything. Norman Rockwell

would find this burg a snooze.. - We settle on a small,

GARAGE ... The peeling sign reads:

"L.N. ORR AUTOMOTIVE"

owned and operated by Memphis Raines ... In blue coveralls,

Memphis has a Plymouth Duster up on the lift ... With him is a kid

- TOM, 19... Lightnin' Hopkins' "Automobile Blues" plays through --

Tom starts to say "not really". Instead, he nods. Memphis takes a

root beer from an old-style machine. He goes out ... front ... To

where an old Denver Pyle-coot - BUDGY - sits on a bench, smoking

an unfiltered Lucky ... Memphis sits beside him, pets the

200-year-old DOG that lounges nearby...

Budgy cackles ... Memphis looks out at the dusty little hamlet ...

Budgy points at a passing car ...

Budgy points at another car ... And we get the sense they play

this game every day...

And Budgy looks impressed... As always ...

Memphis nods ... Sips his root beer ...

Memphis looks at him ... Can't believe it himself ...

And, from inside the garage, there's the most horrific GRIND of

metal on metal, as Tom has started the Plymouth -

Memphis goes back into the garage, Budgy cackles.

EXT. RANCHO PALOS VERDES - BUSINESS DISTRICT

A FORD ESCORT - driving through the upscale streets of Palos

Verdes. Three KIDS, 20, inside ... The driver is FREB, a little

dim; in the back is MIRROR MAN, black, always wears those mirrored

shades ... In the passenger seat is

KIP - Memphis' younger brother ... The car pulls to a stop.

Fancy stores - all of them closed - line this affluent business

district ... Freb consults a piece of paper ...

And he points ... To a CORNER BUILDING - EXOTIC MOTORS LTD. Twenty

foot high glass - windows surround a SHOWROOM of EXOTIC DREAM

CARS: Porsches and Ferraris, Lamborghinis and Bertones ... And-

there it is, a 1996 LOTUS ESPRIT V8, gleaming in the all-night

showroom lights...

Freb and Mirror Man are startled

He grins at them... He ain't shittin'...

Freb scowls ... Pops the trunk ... Kip gets out ... Goes to the

back ... Freb and Mirror Man share a spook --

Kip reaches into the trunk.... Comes around to them... He's

carrying A BRICK --

And Kip walks toward "Exotic Motors"... Calm and cool ...

Ten feet from it ... He winds up ... And HURLS THE BRICK AT

THE WINDOW Which EXPLODES ON IMPACT, a SHOWER OF GLASS

raining down ...

ALARMS SQUEAL

As Kip walks into the showroom, glass crunching underfoot. Freb

and Mirror Man can't believe it --

INT. EXOTIC MOTORS

Kip goes to the Lotus... With nary a glance around, he's got her

open ... The Lotus' ALARM adds its song to the choir ... Kip,

unmindful, gets behind the wheel ... Screwdriver to the

mechanism... The alarm raging in here...

In moments, the V8's massive 349bhp is bellowing... And Mirror Man

climbs in beside him... And off they go ... Laying several inches

of English rubber. Over the broken glass and out of the

showroom...

EXT. CITY STREETS - PALOS VERDES - NIGHT

The Lotus races through these streets ... At high speeds ...

Kip smiles over the ascending speedometer --

And he pins her ... VROOOOOM -- !

A TENNIS BALL

being bounced against the wall ... Caught ... Bounced again ...

Thunk! Thunk! Thunk!

INT. WAREHOUSE - LONG BEACH HARBOR - NIGHT

A dozen purloined AUTOS are parked here ... And a number of

SHIPPING CONTAINERS ... A thuggish MAN reads the paper ... The

tennis ball bouncer is TUMBLER, 20 ... And he's sitting on a

tilted back chair, and wall-bouncing the ball and annoying the

piss out of

ATLEY JACKSON

whom we remember from the drop-car at our opening ... Atley walks

with a LIMP now... Thunk! Thunk! Thunk!

Thunk! Thunk!

And Atley intercepts the tennis ball ... And hurls it over to the

far side of the warehouse ... Tumbler merely grins ...

EXT. SAN PEDRO STREETS - THE LOTUS

Heading for Long Beach... Stopped at a light ... A CAMARO pulls up

next to them... A KID behind the wheel, a BLONDE beside him...

Kip eyeballs them... Engines are revved... Challenges are

implied... Mirror Man panics ...

And the light turns green ... And he pops the clutch ... And

they are off ... It's a good old fashioned drag race ... Kip

smiles at the blonde ... Mirror Man is freaking out ... Kip's

eyes are on fire ... He clocks the speedometer ...

Yes, way. Kip floors it. They bury the Camaro in its wake... The

gauge rising ... 90, 100, 110 ... Mirror Man is having an

embolism...

They warp-speed by a POLICE CRUISER... Both kids totally unaware

of the POLICE CHOPPER up on high... With them in its sights ...

And they drive ... At last, ending up at --

THE WATERFRONT - A dark latticework of docks and wharves,

warehouses and shipping crates... The freighters are somehow

graceful against the moonlit water ...

INT. WAREHOUSE

Tumbler studies his watch... Now he's a little concerned ... He

looks up ... Atley is glaring at him...

And then the Lotus pulls into the warehouse... Tumbler flashes

Atley a "told-you-so" smile... Kip and Mirror Man get out of the

car...

Kip walks over to a CLIPBOARD with a magic marker tethered to it

... It is a list of cars ... He draws a black line through "13)

1996 Lotus Esprit V8"... The others are clocking the car...

Tumbler passes out 40 oz.s ... The vibe is celebratory...

Bottles are clinked... Beer is sipped ... Only, a HOT WHITE

SPOTLIGHT bores through the skylight ... And the whup-whup of the

chopper's ROTORS... And now the sounds of SIRENS ... And the

thuggish man gets to his feet ...

And they do... Heading out the back ... It's tough for Atley with

his limp ... On the way out:

INT. WAREHOUSE - LATER - NIGHT

A HALF-DOZEN POLICE CARS. The CHOPPER does the usual

spotlight-trailing... It's turned into a total pig

circus ... A car pulls to a stop ... And out steps Detective

Roland Castlebeck, whom we remember from our opening...

INT. WAREHOUSE

Castlebeck surmises the take ... The cars ... His partner

DETECTIVE DRYCOFF - a sneering Irish boy with zero patience -

comes out from the back ...

Castlebeck nods ... Looks at the cars ...

INT. "L.N. ORR AUTOMOTIVE" - INDEPENDENCE - DUSK

Memphis goes through invoices in the cluttered back office. When a

brand new purple MERCEDES SLK, windows tinted, pulls in out front.

It looks oddly anachronistic here in Independence. Memphis senses

danger. He goes out. Budgy and his dog are here... Budgy looks

spooked... Tom, too ...

And standing there, by the Mercedes, like a wraith, is ATLEY

JACKSON, in long leather coat, smoking a cigarette ... As out of

place here as a maggot on a muffin...

And he begins to sing...

Memphis studies him...

He laughs some more ... Chain-lights his cig ...

Memphis looks at him...

INT. TEDDY'S TAVERN - NIGHT

A BARMAID sets down a pitcher of beer and two mugs...

She leaves... Atley is staring at him... Memphis shrugs...

Atley takes a sip of his beer,...

Atley frowns ... Looks at him...

Clearly Memphis is not ...

Memphis takes a beat ... Sips at his brew ... Then:

Memphis waits ... In no mood for guessing games ...

Which means nothing to us ... Though the look on Memphis, face

speaks volumes ...

Memphis nods ... His face clenched in despair. We FADE TO BLACK,

As a SUPER on-screen reads: PART 1: STOLEN MOMENTS

We PRE-LAP J. Geils Band's "Hard-Drivin' Man" and CUT TO:

THREE PLATES OF BACON, EGGS AND HASH BROWNS

placed on the service deck by a short-order COOK...

INT. RUBY'S ALL-NITE - LONG BEACH - NIGHT

A 24-hour diner in the heart of Long Beach... The three plates are

picked-up with an impressive dexterity by

HELEN RAINES

early 60s, clear-eyed... In pink Ruby's uniform and chunky

shoes... Black currant hair striated with wisps of gray... Helen

delivers the plates to a booth of college kids ...

And she goes to the coffee station... When

And she turns around to see Memphis standing there. Her expression

displays many things ... Most of them joy ...

And she goes to Memphis ... Wraps her arms around him ... Squeezes

tight ...

She takes his head in her hands ... Kisses his cheek ... Then the

other... Hugs on ... Unmindful of the customers ... The cook

smiles from behind the order wheel ...

And she leads him over to a booth ... Barking to the cook - RUBY -

on the way...

And they settle in ... Across the booth from each other ... She

takes his hands...

And Helen flushes, a bit ashamed maybe ...

He looks at her ... Beat ...

ANGLE - RUBY. He's on the PHONE in the kitchen...One eye

on Memphis and Helen --

BACK TO - MEMPHIS AND HELEN RAINES ...

And, on her sad smile, we PRE-LAP Sammy Hagar's "I Can't Drive 55"

and SLAM CUT TO:

INT. "THE SIDE POCKET" - POOL HALL - NIGHT

A dozen tables... Smells of blue chalk and whiskey... The juke box

cranked... We take it to the back of the joint ... Where Kip, and

Tumbler and Mirror Man are knocking a rack... Freb sits nearby,

with a few badly made-up GIRLS...

He sinks another ball. A kid, 15, TOBY - comes up to them.

He groks their fear...

Kip looks at him...

ANGLE THE FRONT DOOR. For Memphis has entered. He

clocks the room. Sees them at the rear ... Walks back

And Kip looks up ... To see Memphis there ...

And he pumps his hand... Memphis continues to stare at Kip

Hold the stare... The others are excited...

He smiles ... Memphis eyeballs him... Toby is there ...

And Memphis turns back to Kip, who's picked up a pool cue.

And he makes to rack 'em up ... Then:

Kip shoots him a look... As if he's spoken out of turn ...

The others look glum... Kip laughs ... Long and hard...

And Kip sinks a ball ... Memphis looks at the others ... They

nod... It's true ... The money's gone ...

Memphis nods ... Looks at all of them... Smiles ... And then

REACHES OUT, GRABBING Kip by the collar, yanking him to his feet

and in close, nose to nose ...

And with that, he shoves Kip back down into his seat, toppling the

table, bottles and glasses crashing... And barrels away from them,

the crowd parting like a wound...

Kip's crew left stunned, flustered, and maybe a bit impressed...

And, off of Kip's furious look, we CUT TO:

EXT. LONG BEACH HARBOR - NIGHT

A chill in the air. Memphis walks toward a range of lowslung

buildings ...

EXT. WOODBURN SCRAP AND METAL - NIGHT

A virtual cityscape of dismantled automobile carcasses, piled up

high for as far as the eye can see ... A huge FORK LIFT scoops up

a wreck and hauls it over to the CRUSHER... Watch as the car is

FLATTENED, for easy shelving ...

Midnight auto nonpareil ... To one side of the yard is a GARAGE:

Watch as a HONDA ACCORD, with a BLOODY WINDSHIELD, enters the

garage. A young Mexican KID driving.

A SIGN: "LOCK YOUR CAR OR IT MAY BE GONE IN 60 SECONDS!"

INT. GARAGE - CHOP SHOP

A CAR is CHOPPED ... Pulled apart ... Fenders, doors, panels,

interiors, air bags ...

EXT. WOODBURN SCRAP AND METAL - FRONT ENTRANCE

Memphis knocks on the door ... A dog-faced MAN opens it ...

INT. WOODBURN SCRAP AND METAL

Memphis follows Dog-face to the back of this building. Follows him

into another room. Which is

A WORKSHOP

An enormous WOODWORKING SHOP, fully tricked-out with state-of-the-

art table saws and drill presses, jointers and power planes.

An antique treadle lathe stands in one corner. A stock layout of

expensive woods - oak, birch, maple, cherry, mahogany - is stacked

against the rear wall ...

Jars and bottles and cakes of glues, resins, stains and bleaches

cram a shelf unit ... There's a MAN here, at a band saw. This is

RAYMOND CALITRI, 59 ...

He wears an apron, protective glasses and a lopsided sneer. A

Richard Widmark motherfucker - with the diamond hard look of a

cobra. The liegelord of downtown...

And now he works the a hand saw, making critical cross-cuts on a

wide panel of maple ... Atley Jackson is here as well ... As noisy

as it is out in the yard, in here, once the door is closed, it's

as SILENT-as a tomb...

A BANK OF MONITORS on one wall show the cars being crushed and

disassembled in the yard. Memphis is led into the room.

Calitri nods and Dog-face leaves the room... Calitri smiles ...

Examines his fresh cut...

He says the name like other men say "cancer." The phone on

his desk BLINKS. Calitri picks it up. Listens. Looks at

one of the monitors. Where the Mexican man is talking to

several Calitri EMPLOYEES. Calitri hangs up...

And he picks up a MORTISE CHISEL on his way out. Palming it ...

INT. GARAGE - THE MEXICAN MAN

is sobbing. As Raymond Calitri marches toward him, glancing at the

bloodied windshield.

And Calitri, rapid-fire, PUNCTURES the man's belly and chest and

legs with the chisel, old-school prison-shiv style ... Until the

man is on the floor, howling ...

INT. CALITRI'S WORKSHOP

Memphis can-see this from one of the monitors. He looks at

Atley...

Calitri is back, wiping the sweat from his brow with a rag.

Calitri looks at him, then waves a hand around the shop...

He gestures to each item - exquisitely-rendered woodwork. Then

gestures to the yard...

Memphis glances to Atley... Atley shrugs ...

Calitri blinks. Smiles. Nods...

Memphis nods, notes a PISTOL, resting on a shelf nearby.

Memphis eyes him...

Calitri takes a manila ENVELOPE from his desk... Hands it to

Memphis, who takes out the SINGLE SHEET OF PAPER inside.

Memphis scans the list ... Looks up at Calitri ...

Memphis scans the list ...

Now Memphis looks up...

Calitri smiles ... Memphis 'looks at him... At Atley Realizing

the trap ...

Calitri goes to one corner of the shop... Takes a tarp off

of a full couch MAHOGANY CASKET...

Memphis waits, knowing where this is going --

Calitri WALL SWITCH and the a corrugated steel SLIDING DOOR is

RAISED, revealing a LOADING DOCK facing the back of the yard... Two

MEN are working out there... DIGGER AND BUTZ scuzzy dudes, mid-30s

and dressed in dirty coveralls ...

And they come over --

Memphis says nothing. Calitri grins ... Nods to Digger an Butz,

who go back to work...

Memphis' look is cold and furious ... Plaintive:

Atley hits the wall-switch and the steel door slides shut. Calitri

turns to Memphis...

With that, he puts his protective glasses back on - and fires up

an abrasive-disc-finishing machine, adjusting the miter gage and

beginning to sand the Outside curve of an angled chamfer.

EXT. HELEN RAINES' HOUSE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

A small New England-style shingle and clapboard, up on a hill

overlooking the port. A small GUEST-HOUSE behind it ...

INT. HELEN RAINES' HOUSE

Helen clears away the dinner dishes ... The TV is on. The news. We

see a CRIME SCENE ...

Memphis glances to the TV... Grimaces ... He looks out the window

... At the SEDAN parked below...

EXT. RAINES' HOUSE - NIGHT

Memphis comes out ... Moves to the sedan parked across the street

... it is Detectives Castlebeck and Drycoff...

They get out of the car... The view of San Pedro from up here is a

spectacular bedspread of lights ...

He and Castlebeck lock eyes ... Castlebeck takes a pear from his

coat pocket ... Sets to polishing it ...

Castlebeck gives him a long look... As they walk back to the car...

He laughs... And they drive off ... Memphis watching them go ...

once they're gone... He walks ...

EXT. "THE SIDE POCKET" - BACK ALLEY EXIT - NIGHT

Kip comes out of the club... Toby follows ...

They smile...And go to Kip's TRANS AM...

And this seems funny to Kip... He smiles..

And they are fronted by TWO GOONS ... Who toss them up against the

wall...

One of the goons SOCKS Toby in the gut. Toby doubles over. Kip

strains to intervene, but his goon holds him back --

And the goon punches him in the face. And Kip goes down. And out.

EXT. WOODBURN SCRAP AND METAL - NIGHT

Kip comes to. In his car. Hot white lights blind him. The Trans

Am is in the crusher. FIGURES above him. Calitri. The goons ...

Kip tries to get out. The doors are pinned by the forklift.

Calitri nods ... And the crusher presses ... The roof caves a bit

... Kip is close to scrunch ...

INT. CALITRI'S WOODSHOP

Atley is here, watching Calitri and Kip. one of the monitors. He's

miserable. But there is nothing he can do.

EXT. SCRAPYARD - NIGHT

Kip continues to struggle free...

Calitri does have to admire the stones on the kid. But. Another

nod. Another crusher-press. Another scrunch...

Nothing. Silence. Kip peers through the slit that the

side window has become ... Only they are gone ... And there

is another awful NOISE ... Kip strains to discern its

origin ... Only he can't get the angle ...

We can. It's a huge CRANE, tipped with a GRIPPING CLAW... It is

maneuvered over the Trans Am... Grasps it. . . And LIFTS IT

INTO THE AIR ... Kip, terrified, inside ...

And, as the crane dangles the Trans Am toward the black waters of

the harbor, we CUT TO:

INT. HELEN RAINES' HOUSE - KITCHEN

Memphis is at the kitchen table. The list of cars before him. He's

making notations. He gets to his feet ... He goes to check on his

mother ... She's asleep in her room... He closes the door ...

And goes back to the kitchen. He goes to a framed PHOTOGRAPH - of

he and Kip. Earlier times. Happier times.

When there is an enormous THUD! From outside. Memphis goes to a

window. Sees a RAMP TRUCK unloading a gnarled blob of metal.

Memphis runs outside. Just as the ramp truck drives off ...

Memphis goes to the mangled Trans Am... Leans down ... And there's

Kip ... Seriously smooshed in the flattened car.

Memphis goes to the garage ... Finds a crowbar, an acetylene

TORCH, tin-snips ... He goes back to the wrecked car... And sets

to work... He looks at Kip ... Shakes his head...

Indeed... Memphis has freed him ... Kip crawls from the wreckage

... His clothes in tatters... Blood seeps from a variety of

contusions ... He limps ... Memphis helps him to the guest house

...

INT. KIP'S GUEST HOUSE - LATER - NIGHT

Small, cluttered... Posters of Kurt Cobain, a skying Kobe Bryant,

Pamela Anderson, two nude girls draped over a glittering

Lamborghini Espada, etc. There's a fish tank... And a big-screen

TV, on which the Lakers are currently defending a high-speed

Boston Celtic fast-break...

Memphis sits on a ratty couch before the TV... Kip comes out of

the bedroom... He's changed clothes ... He wears clunky fur-lined

MOON BOOTS, leopard-skin Speedos and a tshirt ... He looks

slightly ridiculous...

Throughout the scene, Memphis should be studying Kip, as if he's

seeing him for the very first time ... And waiting for the

inevitable crack...

And Kip limps toward the refrigerator ... He comes back with two

beers ... Hands one to Memphis ... Glances at the TV --

And a cut on Kip's forehead starts to bleed ... Kip grabs a towel

... Presses it to his head --

Memphis holds it up ... Kip nods ... There are a pile of IGNITIONS

on the table ... Kip picks one up, absently begins trying to strip

it...

Beat ... They watch the game ... Kip replaces the soaked towel

with another ...

Beat ...

And Kip hoists himself painfully to his feet ... Limps over to the

'fridge ... Memphis watches him, a slight grin at Kip's attempt at

cool ... Kip peers into the 'fridge ...

And he brings over a bowl of olives.

And they nibble on them. Kip bites into one ... And the juice

stings his cracked lip ... But he disguises his grimace as an

appreciative nod...

And for a moment, they nibble olives and drop pits into an

ashtray... Then:

And Memphis glances out the window. To the crushed car. Kip

catches the glance, glances himself, chooses to ignore it.

Kip shrugs ... Picks up another olive... Remembers the pain' of

the last one... Drops it back in the bowl ... Memphis is staring

at him, disgusted... Kip feels it ...

And now Memphis gets to his feet ... Paces the place...

Beat ... Hold the look ... Kip shifts in his chair ... Even this

hurts... He tries to hide the wince ... Memphis goes to the

window, looks out at the harbor below... Beat ... Then:

And he turns back to Kip ...

And the brothers look at each other ... In the pale glow of the

TV... For a long beat ... And then we'll CUT TO:

EXT. LONG BEACH HARBOR - CANNERY / FISH AUCTION - DAY

A rack of eel and OCTOPUS hung out to dry in the salty sun ...

Memphis walks with Atley Jackson past the bustling commercial

fishing hubbub: Portuguese FISHERMEN unloading albacore and

bluefin from their ship's hold; Greek FISHERMEN emptying mackerel

and halibut from their nylon trawl nets; their WOMEN gut, clean

and fillet ...

As they walk, Atley is selecting FISH from the various MARINERS

... Who wrap it up for him... He places it in a leather satchel

... Everyone seems to know him...

An old FISHERMAN, who speaks broken English, wraps up several

steaks...

They walk...

Nothing from Atley... They walk ... Memphis looks at him.

Memphis nods. Atley shrugs, and selects some halibut

filets.

Atley looks at him...

Atley nods...

Memphis looks at him... Shakes his head... FADE TO BLACK.

As a SUPER on-screen reads: PART II - BACK TO WRONG

EXT. OTTO'S AUTO - NIGHT

The hustle and bustle of a full-service auto restoration

operation ...

Dig the 157 Chevy, as an orange diamond tuck and roll with

orange fur interior is installed... Dig the 153 Corvette

as its front and rear suspension is replaced with coils

and airshocks ... Dig the 150 Merc, as its chrome is

stripped off and the old paint sandblasted and holes

brazed...

All under the watchful eye of...

OTTO HALLIWELL

Late 60s. A feisty grease-soaked curmudgeon who begs the

question: how the hell did they manage to rock together

Yoda and the ghost of Walter Huston... ?

But he remains the Zen master of cars and all that cars are, were

and can be ...

His mixed-breed MUTT - Hemi - licks his balls in one corner

Otto is currently AIRBRUSHING a candy-colored, variegated DESIGN

on the deck lid of a Camaro ... It is painstaking work ... But he

is an artist ...

His woman - JUNIE - a tall blonde, early 40s, body of a thousand

dances, wipes his brow, like a scrub nurse ...

Memphis wanders in...

Otto sees Memphis ... Drops his brush... He walks over to Memphis

... Takes him in his arms ... Hugs him close... Actually waltzes

him a few steps ...

Memphis is stunned at the transformation this place has gone

through ...

He calls over to the MEXICAN MAN working on the pick-up ...

And Otto goes back to the Camaro ... To finish his work...

Otto looks up frustrated... To Junie

And Junie hits PLAY on a cassette deck ... And, instantly, ENGINE

SOUNDS rip from the shop's stereo speakers ... Otto listens, as

if it were a Mahler symphony...

Memphis smiles ... These eccentricities are old hat...

Otto has finished the Camaro ... He looks at Memphis --

And he closes his eyes ... To listen to the Ferrari tape ...

We PRE-LAP Simon And Garfunkel's "Baby Driver" and CUT TO:

CLOSE ON: A SIGN READING: "PLEASURE CRUISE DRIVING SCHOOL"

atop a moving DODGE ARIES K. Which is nearly SIDE-SWIPED by an

oncoming PICK-UP. A MAN HOWLS IN TERROR...

INT. DODGE - MOVING - CITY STREETS - DAY

A timid CHINESE GIRL - JENNY, 23 - negotiates the vehicle at

10 & 2. Riding shotgun, her howling instructor is DONNY ASTRICKY - 41,

whom we remember from six years ago. Now he's paunchy, with Ernie

Borgnine tough-guy-warmth. At one time, he kicked out the

jams. Now he teaches driver's ed...

Jenny pulls the car over in a lopsided lurch...

She parks it. He stabs at the side-view mirror ...

She starts to cry... Donny softens ...

EXT. PLEASURE CRUISE DRIVING SCHOOL - DAY

Memphis waits outside ... The Aries K comes crawling toward him.

Donny gets out of the car ... Sees Memphis ...

Donny frowns... Looks close at Memphis ... Then:

His pause is meaningful ...

INT. OTTO'S AUTO - NIGHT

In a wood-panelled back room, around a conference table: Memphis

and Donny sit... With the list before them...

Otto enters. Giggles...

Beat ... Donny examines the list ...

The door opens ... One of Otto's WORKERS is there...

But they walk past: Kip, Tumbler, Mirror Man, Toby, Freb

Memphis looks to Otto ... Otto shrugs ...

Memphis considers ... He has little choice ...

Memphis looks at him... Shakes his head...

Memphis shakes his head... Sighs ...

Freb starts to Protest ... Shrugs ...

Memphis looks at all of them ... Sighs...

Tumbler looks to Kip...

Kip and the others nod... Makes sense ...

Memphis looks at him. Because that's what he was afraid of.

So we'll PRE-LAP The Beach Boys' "409" and CUT TO:

INT. "THE NAUTICAL MILE" SALOON - NIGHT

A SHOT GLASS, slammed down on a bar by a surly DRUNK... In a

mariner saloon. Drunken SAILORS and FISHERMAN and NAVY TYPES.

Sawdust on the floor. Broken beer mirrors. A rough joint...

The BARTENDER comes over.. . She is a dark-haired, heavily

tattooed GIRL, 26, with the faded blue world-weariness of Roy Orbison

song... Her name is Sara Wayland... And she goes by SWAY. She

collects the Drunk's empty glass...

And the Drunk reaches out across the bar, to grab a bottle And

Sway grabs his hand, twists it ... The Drunk groans in agony ...

And Sway, still clutching his hand, hops over the bar ... And

drags the drunk by his twisted hand to the front ... Cries of

"Attagirl, Sway!" pepper the air ...

EXT. "THE NAUTICAL MILE" - NIGHT

Sway tosses him... The Drunk hitting the pavement ...

And she freezes ... Because standing there, is Memphis ... She

looks at him ... Shocked is a good place to start ...

And she heads back inside ... And he follows her...

INT. "THE NAUTICAL MILE"

They head toward the bar...

And she hops back behind the bar ...

She waves to a 30-year-old CAT drinking with his buddies. He waves

back. Memphis frowns.

She smiles sourly at him...

She stares at him... Shakes her head... Busies herself with her

glassware ... Beat ...

ANGLE - MITCH. Watching them talk ...

He studies her... Then:

And now she looks concerned

And the cat - MITCH - comes over with two empty pitchers

And she goes to the tap ... Leaving Memphis and Mitch ...

Memphis nods ... Beat. They sit there. Regard Sway...

And Mitch leans over to him, conspiratorially ...

And Memphis turns to him...

And Memphis reaches out, and GRABS Mitch's nipple, PINCHING.

Mitch's face curls ...

And Memphis releases him... And Mitch goes down hard ... And Sway

comes over ...

And he's out of there, before Mitch's PALS can get to him.

She looks at the door ... Shrugs ...

INT. OTTO'S AUTO - LATER - NIGHT

Memphis, Kip, Donny, Mirror Man and Otto sit around the garage ...

Going through the list ... Tumbler calls from the next room:

Freb pulls in an '89 Cadillac Coupe De Ville ...

Freb pulls in. Pops the trunk. The gate is closed.

He pulls out a set of golf clubs ... Freb brings over a duffel ...

Mirror Man plucks something from the trunk ...

It's a plasticine BAG - full of a WHITE POWDER...

He pierces the skin.. Tastes ...

And they pull back the trunk tarp ... And there are perhaps TWO

DOZEN similar smack-filled BAGS ...

Donny makes to grab the bag from Mirror Man ... But Mirror Man

holds on ... They tug back and forth ... The bag DROPS ...

Splitting on the ground, behind the car. Spilling heroin.

But a BANG! BANG! on the front gate, gives them all pause.

And the others scatter into the back office, with their tools and

devices and lists. Leaving only Memphis and Otto.

Memphis picks up the broken bag ... Sticks it in the trunk ...

Puts the golf clubs in on top of it ... Slams the trunk. Only

there's still a neat MOUNTAIN OF SMACK ON THE FLOOR by the rear of

the Caddy ... But there's no time...

For the gate is opened. Detective Castlebeck ambles in.

Castlebeck looks at Otto... Otto grins... Castlebeck walks around

the garage... Taking it all in...

Castlebeck notes the Caddy ...

ANGLE - the mound of heroin on the floor ...

Castlebeck takes out a WALKIE ... Barks into it ...

He clicks off ... Otto and Memphis share one ... A glance to the

smack ... Castlebeck is a mere inches from it ...

Before they can respond, the radio crackles ...

Castlebeck looks disappointed... Otto grins ... Castlebeck stares

at the Caddy, still unconvinced...

Memphis opens the driver's side door ... Gestures Castlebeck in

... Castlebeck gets behind the wheel ...

And Castlebeck starts the car...

ANGLE - TAILPIPE ... WHOOSH! All of the heroin on the flo is blown

away by the exhaust ... Memphis winks to Otto ... Castlebeck seems

satisfied ... Gets out.

Castlebeck stops at the gate... Turns back to them...

And Castlebeck is gone. Memphis and Otto exhale big time.. The

others come out from the back... To find Memphis and Otto dumping

the heroin into the sink, running the tap ...

INT. RAINES APARTMENT - NIGHT

Kip is in front of the TV, playing a video game. Helen Raines is

at the kitchen table, going through a PHOTO ALBUM... Memphis comes

home ... Hangs up his coat ...

He kisses her head ...

Kip nods ... Plays on ...

He smiles ... Sits down next to her ... They go through the

PHOTOS: - childhood shots of Memphis and Kip, a younger Helen;

Memphis at 17, in his "Ike's Garage" coveralls; 14year-old

Memphis, an infant Kip, and their father (ROBERT RAINES) a MAN

with bright eyes and a quiet smile, standing before an old Cutlass

442; Robert Raines ... Outside a car dealership. We can almost

feel his strong, sure presence ...

Memphis looks at his mother ... As she looks at the picture.

Nothing from Kip ... Eyes glued to the TV... Memphis glances to

his Mother ...

They laugh ... Look at the album ... At Robert Raines ...

Memphis and Helen look at him... Then:

Tears stand in Helen's eyes ... Kip gets to his feet ...

And he walks out of the house, door slamming behind him. Memphis

turns to his mother ...

And she nods ...

ANGLE - A PHOTO. Robert Raines. Smiling beside an Olds 98.

EXT. INTERNATIONAL TOWERS HIGH RISE CONDOS - DAY

The garage door opens as a resident drives out ... And Memphis and

Donny and Kip and Toby enter the garage ... They walk along the

rows of parked cars ... Searching ...

To prevent Donny from biting the kid's head off, Memphis chimes in

with:

Indeed, slotted nearby is a '67 SHELBY MUSTANG GT-500 Silver with

black top ...

And he looks at her. An old friend he hasn't seen in years.

Toby looks blank ...

They head off ... Memphis turns back to the Shelby

INT. OTTO'S AUTO - BACK ROOM - DAY

puts together BRIEFCASES, containing the requisite TOOLS: slim-

jim, gizmo, screwdriver, ratchet, dent-puller, a mini-battery with

pointy leads ...

- Mirror Man is showing off one of his GADGETS - beepersized

DEVICE - to Otto... They stand before a locked MAZDA.

He does ... The door UNLOCKS ... The car's ALARM gives a weak

chirp and dies... Otto looks at Donny ...

Kip and Memphis are with Toby, who has his laptop out ...

Memphis nods ... Fairly impressed...

Donny and Freb are inside the Caddy ... Freb's attempts to start

it fail...

Donny smiles ...

Donny smiles ... Freb frowns ...

And then Sway enters ... Donny gets out of the Caddy ...

Otto is before her ... Bowing from the waist ...

They embrace. Memphis and Kip enter from the other room...

She looks at Memphis ... Small nod... Small smile ...

But the kids look high near thunderstruck ... The others laugh ...

Go back to their work ... Memphis and Sway

She studies him... Nods ...

And then she sees something at the entrance ...

He follows her gaze ... To where -- A MAN, early 40s, has walked

in. Tall, gaunt, ice-eyed. This man never speaks. And his nose is

a gnarled blob of scar tissue ... Which is why they call him

THE SPHINX

And the others really don't dig his scene ...

The Sphinx nods to all. Smiles warmly, but it comes out creepy.

Freb whispers to Otto ...

And Otto embraces the taller man ... And the others stand

around, offering uneasy glances to The Sphinx ...

We PRE-LAP Gary Numan's new-wave rave classic "Cars".

drives the 3rd van: Otto and Toby with him.

They carry pens and NOTEBOOKS ... And, as they drive around,

they're searching out cars ... When they see an auto that

corresponds to the list, they take down its license plate.

Memphis dials the cell ... Mirror Man answers on the speaker in

his van ... Tumbler in his ... We'll CROSS-CUT the scene as

necessary from van to van ...

They drive on ... Till --

As the scenes in the vans play out - we should be INTERCUTTING

with SHOTS of CARS ON THE STREET. LICENSE PLATES. Their NOTEBOOKS.

locks pop open ... Otto grins...

Sway slides out from beneath a Testarosa ... In her greasy

coveralls, hair tied back, a motorhead's dream girl ...

She gestures to where the LIST of 50 is on the counter.

As she speaks we CUT TO:

EXT. 1443 LOCKLIN - RANCHO PALOS VERDES - DAY

A massive house of glass and steel in a fancy

neighborhood. We MOVE FOR THE HOUSE. Over the fine-trimmed

lawn.

INTO THE SPARTAN LIVING ROOM...

Massive framed Lichtenstein and Haring pieces on the wall

... Surround the yellow ROADSTER, which sits up on a

platform ... Check out JUDGE CROFT, a nasty fat man in his

late 50s ... He sits in the nearly empty room... A complex

system of directional lighting illuminates the Roadster

...

The judge gazes at the car, admiring its jet-pod

taillamps... A MAID comes in with a tray of tea service

... The maid crosses the Judge's line of sight... Watch

as he curses her out, his face going beet red with fury...

INT. BACCHIOCHI'S FOREIGN MOTORS

Sway looks at Memphis ...

She nods ... Long look ...

She hits the Lava soap and starts washing the grease from her

towel into it ...

EXT. BACCHIOCHI'S FOREIGN MOTORS - DAY

coming to:

EXT. TEN-TON TRANSFER COMPANY - FRONT GATES

A huge trucking company warehouse. Kip gets out. Bolt-cuts the

chain-fence out front.

And Memphis drives on in, passing the long rows of gargantuan

CAR CARRIERS here. He picks one ...

He slim-jims the door ... But the ALARM goes off ... A wild

whooping alarm ... Deafening... Try as he might, he can't get it

off. He pops the trunk. Looks for wires ... Nothing.

Then, at once, it goes off. Memphis turns. Kip is there. He holds

a little DEVICE.

He gets behind the wheel. Pops the ignition. The truck's flipping

stack belches. Memphis climbs in next to him.

And he grins and puts the truck into gear. And off they go

INT. OTTO'S AUTO - GARAGE - NIGHT

The Replacements chime in with "Someone Take The Wheel." Memphis

and the crew ... All but Sway are present.

Tumbler and Mirror Man follow Memphis to one side of the shop ...

To a window ... He gestures outside to where we see and UNMARKED

CAR and the orange glow of two cigarettes ... Staking them out ...

Mirror Man and Tumbler regard the cops ...

And they follow him back into the garage ...

Mirror Man looks horrified ...

The Sphinx grins at him...

And Otto and Junie come out with two bottles of champagne and some

paper cups ...

Everyone toasts ... Drinks ... Donny goes to the tape deck... Hits

PLAY ... And "Little Deuce Coupe" by The Beach Boys BLASTS.

("Little Deuce Coupe/You don't know what I got...")

And all of our guys dance to it ... Singing along ... Otto dances

with Junie; Tumbler with Toby; even The Sphinx lipsyncs the falsetto

parts ...

Yes, it's the requisite rock-to-an-oldie bit ... But God, it's

fun. As they exorcise some pre-boost jitters.  Only Kip stands

aside from the frolic ... We watch them dance and laugh and sing

for a bit ...

And then Atley Jackson is there. And behind him, another Calitri

GOON... And, finally, Calitri himself stands there.

Someone kills the music. They all look at him... Donny and The

Sphinx nod to Atley ...

Calitri ignores him... Looks at Kip ...

He smiles ... And Kip actually makes a run for him... Only to be

held back by Tumbler and Donny ...

And with that, he leaves, his goons following. Leaving our

crew to stare after him ... And then we FADE TO BLACK...

As a SUPER on-screen reads PART III: SWITCHIN'-TO-GLIDE

INT. HELEN RAINES' HOUSE - GARAGE - DAY

the curb outside, using parked cars as cover... She really cooks...

ANGLE - THE 'CUDA. As it cruises along. Is stopped by a discarded

40 oz. empty... But Mirror Man maneuvers and its back on track ...

At last, parking jammed up to the front, right tire of DRYCOFF AND

HAWKINGS' UNMARKED.

And he hits a button on his radio control ... ANGLE - the model

'Cuda. Wedged in front of the tire. As a quartet of thin steel,

razor-tipped SPIKES thrust out from the Shaker hood ... A fraction

away from the tire's skin ... Mirror Man and Tumbler appear

satisfied ...

And they make him wait ... And wait ... Just like the real D.W.P.

does ... They high-five...

At last, Toby answers ...

Kip can hear his anger ... Whispers:

And Kip pantomimes eating. Toby, at first puzzled, gets it.

Pause ... They've got him... Thumbs-up ...

And the Judge hangs up ...

Giggling wildly as the 'Cuda zooms after him.

An expansive warehouse surrounded by chain-link fence ... Enormous

SHIPPING CONTAINERS are here, in which the stolen cars will be

2) Donny Astricky and Freb ... Donny's playing Miles Davis.

3) Memphis and Sway ... And Bruce ...

4) Mirror Man and The Sphinx... The Sphinx puts on GLASSES with

attached FAKE NOSE, to cover his gnarled one ...

He uses his screwdriver to REMOVE four rivets on the Mazda's

Clubbed steering column ... In seconds, the CLUBBED STEERING WHEEL

IS REMOVED, Club still on it. Memphis pops in the steering wheel

he brought, jerry-bangs the rivets ...

And they do ... Sway rolls down her window ... Tosses something as

they drive off -

ANGLE - THE OLD STEERING WHEEL. "Club" firmly affixed to it. On

the ground, in the Mazda's old parking place...

looking through the consul. Comes up with a tube of LIPSTICK. Uses

the visor mirror to apply it.

And she looks at him... She's really laid the lipstick on

thick ... But it's oddly effective ...

Beat. She looks out the window, throws the following away.

She looks at him... But he's stopped the car... For Kip and

Tumbler are waiting at the side of the street. They get in.

EXT. LONG BEACH STREET - NIGHT

Freb dead-shorts the alarm system, grounding it out on the car's

own metal surface, just like they taught him... He's in the

Mirror Man stares at the opened door ...

And Memphis and the others drive up ...

And in they go --

INT. WAREHOUSE

Dark as pitch. Flashlights come on. To reveal

ROW UPON ROW OF GLEAMING FERRARIS

Old and new models. Daytonas and Boxers and Dinos and

Testarossas. There must be at least fifty of them here.

Flashlight beams dance over car after car. It's a treasure chest

of automotive jewels ... All of our heroes are in awe. And then a

soft whimpering. They turn. To see Sway, overcome with emotion.

And it is Kip that puts an arm around her ... She sobs into his

chest ... Never taking her eyes from the array of Italian grace

... Indeed, they are all in something of trance. Memphis is the

first one out --

The others are still gazing ...

And they set to work...

Finds the right one ... Installs it ... Tightens the 3 screws ...

Starts the car with his own key ...

And off they go ...

him... The seats are sooo low ...

He gestures to the speedometer ... Calibrated to 200 MPH..

The Sphinx shrugs ... And they head out ...

climb into the limo... Drive off ...

INT. LAMBORGHINI COUNTACH - MOVING - NIGHT

The Sphinx drives ... Mirror Man pops in his tape ... Albert

King's "Drivin' Wheel."

He boogies down. The Sphinx is bewitched, awed by the car's

magnificent power. But then Mirror Man SCREAMS -- ! With pure

terror. For, at his feet, wrapped around his legs, is

A BOA CONSTRICTOR - some 8-feet long... A mass of heavilykeeled

scales shimmering on coiled muscle ... Mirror Man screams on and

on...

The Sphinx swerves wildly... Racing through a red light. Barely

missing an on-coming BUS ... Passing a pair of COPS coming out of

a 7-11. They hop into their unit. Give chase.

EXT. NEWPORT BEACH - THE MASERATI

The Persian man and his date ... Mackin' hard... Behind them

Memphis and Sway wait in the Mazda. Memphis is on the cell

He hangs up ...

Sway nods ... The Maserati's windows are fully-steamed...

Long beat ... He looks at her ...

She looks at him... Shrugs...

She looks at him ...

She looks at him... He leans into her ... Kisses her... Tentative

at first ... Then... With urgency...

INT. G.R.A.B. FORCE OFFICE - NIGHT

Phones ringing like mad... Drycoff walks into Castlebeck's

office...

INT. THE MAZDA - BACK BAY - NIGHT

As "Little Red Corvette" by Prince warbles on the track... Memphis

and Sway still kissing... She breaks it for:

Whispers ...

And yes, this is patently absurd. But it's also oddly sexy.

Back arched... A small moan escapes her ... Prince wails ... And

Sway has achieved whatever kind of silly climax they aspired to

here... She flops back down... Looks at him...

Indeed, the girl has gotten out of the Maserati... And the car has

rocketed off... Memphis punches the gas,'sending Sway to the floor...

PRE-LAP Alice Cooper's "Under My Wheels" and SLAM CUT TO:

EXT. LONG BEACH STREETS - NIGHT

CLOSE UP OF THE "SNAKE" LICENSE PLATE as its ass-end fishtails

like a bastard... The Sphinx is outrunning what is now a

half-dozen CRUISERS ...

INT. COUNTACH - MIRROR MAN

is freaking out ... The snake wrapped all around him...

But The Sphinx shakes his head. No.

Nope. The Sphinx drives on... Into yet another

DIRECTOR'S CHASE SCENE

This one even cooler than the last ... And once they've eluded all

of the police, The Sphinx pulls over to the side of a DARKENED

STREET...

The Sphinx leans over... And PINCHES THE SNAKE BEHIND THE BACK OF

THE HEAD...

But, miraculously, the snake RELAXES ITS GRIP on Mirror Man... And

slithers off... To the back of the car ... Where it immediately

goes back to sleep ... Mirror Man stares at Sphinx, who smiles

genially. Then:

EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

Freb and Donny Astricky have gotten "Laura", a '99 Bentley

started...

And Donny puts her in gear, When a GUN is jammed agains't Donny's

temple ...

Donny looks at the jacker... Surprised... It is a KID ... No more

than 16 ...

And he SLAMS OPEN THE DOOR... catching the kid in the balls ...

And the kid doubles over... Dropping the gun ... Donny gets out of

the car...

And he starts to kick at the kid ... Beat at him...

But then - BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! Bullets rip into Donny Astricky in

terrifying SLOW-MOTION. He turns ... To see another KID ...

Scared... At the edge of the road... Gat held high ... And Donny

drops to the pavement ... And the first Jacker gets to his feet...

Freb goes to Donny... To his splayed-out body ... SIRENS split the

night. The jackers run off down the street.

Freb doesn't know what to do... Donny croaks ...

And Freb-makes to run off down the street... But --

Freb turns back

Freb blinks. Nods. Oh, yeah. He climbs into the Bentley Drives off...

As the CRUISERS pull up around him... And the UNIFORMS getout, guns

drawn, approaching warily -

To find Donny Astricky ... Splayed-out on the pavement ...

Laughing at the moon ... And, as Jimi Hendrix' "Crosstown Traffic"

BLASTS ON TRACK, we CUT TO:

of the final series of boosts ...

1) The Maserati parked and empty. Sway breaches it.

Expert. They drive off ...

2) Kip and Tumbler. Clocking a VIPER. They circle it..

It's loaded with bells and whistles and Clubs and a

metallic voice that warns: "WARNING: YOU ARE TOO CLOSE THE

VEHICLE!" over and over ... Kip shakes his head ...

Ushers Tumbler back ...

3) Mirror Man and The Sphinx deliver an Aston Martin to the docks

... Watch as it is driven into a container. The container loaded

by gantry crane, onto the ship, lashed to the deck by overworked

LONGSHOREMEN...

4) Helen Raines. Looking out the window. Listening to

the scanner for word of her boys...

5) The Big Board. Female names disappearing like dust..

6) Castlebeck and Drycoff. Cruising the streets.

Searching ...

7) Kip and Tumbler return to The Viper. This time, in a RAMP

TRUCK. They raise the ramp. Tie down the Viper. A drive off with

it, to be disarmed at a later, safer venue as it continues its

robotic exhortation of "WARNING. YOU ARE TOO CLOSE TO THE

VEHICLE."  Over and over again ...

8) All our teams... Speeding toward us ... In different

cars ... As the MUSIC FADES and we END MONTAGE

EXT. 1443 LOCKLIN - JUDGE CROFT'S GLASS HOUSE - NIGHT

Where "Annie" the 137 Roadster lives as an objet d'art.

FIGURES in the thicket surrounding the property. Memphis,

Sway, Kip, Tumbler, Mirror Man, The Sphinx...

Mirror Man has the mansion's ELECTRICAL BOX opened... He' going

through the wires ... Cutting alarm, phone, etc.

Memphis is on the cell phone... Face grim... He hangs up.

Beat ... As they all reflect on this...

This cheers them slightly. Until, from the electrical box:

And the few remaining lights of 1443 flicker and fade ... They

regard the house for a beat ...

No one's quite sure ... They look at the house ... At all that

glass ... Then Kip walks to their car ...

And Tumbler and Mirror Man look at each other ...

Too late. The trunk is popped. Kip reaches in. Comes up with, yes,

another BRICK ... And Kip walks toward the house. Toward the vast

windows ...

But Kip forges on, indomitable ... Only he passes the huge glass

windows ... Walking, instead, up to the front door ... And he

SMASHES the brick down onto the DOORKNOB. Knocking it clean off...

Looks back at the others with a wink. And enters the house...

Tumbler runs after him...

INT. 1443 LOCKLIN

Kip walks through the dark house ... At last, coming to the living

room... To "Annie'. He gets behind the wheel ... Her ignition is

quick work. He's got her started, loud, in the quiet house. She

coughs a bit; it's been a long time. Tumbler is there...

And he drives her off the platform. Tumbler directs him...

Her nose bumps a zillion-dollar VASE, which topples and shatters...

And Tumbler climbs in beside him... Kip drives her around the huge

living room... And Kip punches the gas ...

And they drive the Roadster down the hall ... And right through

the OPEN DOOR... Driving down onto the lawn ... Up to their

cohorts ...

And off they go ... Vanishing down the street ... The others watch

after him ... Mirror Man to Memphis:

INT. G.R.A.B. TASK FORCE OFFICE - NIGHT

Drycoff comes into Castlebeck's office ...

He hands Castlebeck the list. Calitri's 50. Castlebeck notes the

last entry...

INT. WAREHOUSE - LONG BEACH HARBOR - NIGHT

Kip and Tumbler deliver the Roadster. Toby checks it in.

And Kip gets on the two-way...

And they climb in behind a waiting Jeep Cherokee ...

But Toby's not around...

No answer... Kip shrugs... And off they go ...

EXT. RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD - CHESTNUT HILL - NIGHT

A nice neighborhood... Upper middle class ... So damn suburban you

can practically smell the gas grills ... A NEIGHBORHOOD SECURITY

PATROL CAR glides by them...

When, from the back of the Jeep:

Toby is there ... Having stowed-away...

He smiles at Kip ... Kip looks at Tumbler ... Drives ... At last,

pulling up to one HOUSE where the '98 Benz - "'Carol" lives. Kip

parks, a half block down ... They get out ... Head for the

house...

And there she is. "Carol." Obsidian black. In the

garage. The garage is open. And THREE KIDS, two boys and a

girl. Late teens. They are standing around "Carol"...

Drinking beer... Listening to the new Beck album on the

car's CD player ... The folks clearly out of town ...

Well-scrubbed, white suburban children of plenty ... The only crew

they've ever run in is J. Crew... From the hedge, Kip, Tumbler and

Toby watch the kids ... With equal parts fascination, loathing,

envy... And then, the kids go inside... Leaving "Carol" exposed...

And before the others can respond, he moves for her. And she's

open... Toby's in ... Butterfly popped - Gizmo in. The others start

to get in when ONE OF THE KIDS comes out from the house. He stares

at Toby, who freezes mid-boost ...

And Toby does... And slams her in reverse.  And they're off

INT. WAREHOUSE -LONG BEACH HARBOR - NIGHT

The group - - Memphis, Sway, Freb, Mirror Man, and The Sphinx

- has returned... The final cars loaded onto the ship ...

Memphis looks out into the night --

EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREETS - "CAROL" - MOVING - NIGHT

Toby drives them out, Kip shotgun, Tumbler in the back. But the

suburbs are confusing. They can't find their way out.

They drive. Only up ahead, blocking the street, LIGHTS blinding...

Are TWO SECURITY PATROL CARS - SECURITY COPS on the strong ...

Guns drawn...

Toby looks to Kip...

Toby pins the gas. Straight at the block... The security cops dive

out of the way. Except for one standing tall and FIRING into the

windshield... Into Toby... The car swerves. Going off the road.

Into a bank of mailboxes.

The security guards run for her... Kip, forehead bloodied,

switches places with Toby, getting behind the wheel ... Punches

the gas ... Getting them out of there ...

INT. "CAROL" - MOVING - NIGHT

Kip drives like a wild man ... Toby is bleeding something fierce...

Shot in the chest...

Kip looks at Tumbler ... They both look at Toby...

EXT. WAREHOUSE -LONG BEACH HARBOR - NIGHT

As the 'Vette comes screaming into the warehouse ... Kip exploding

out of it ... Getting into the back. Memphis goes to the car, sees

Toby ... Front of his shirt covered in blood ... The others gather

around...

Memphis climbs into the car ... Kip is holding Toby...

Toby is clearly dying in Kip's arms...

But Kip is lost ... Doesn't know what to say --

The brothers stare at the boy... Kip wipes his sweatstreaked face...

Kip looks to his brother for help ...

And Mirror Man scurries for the phone... Toby's breathing comes

out in short staccato bursts ...

He looks up at Kip. All of the light goes out of his eyes. And

Toby is dead... Kip holds him for a beat ... Then passes him to a

surprisingly emotional Tumbler ... Kip gets out of the car, runs

for the opposite end of the warehouse ...

The others are stunned... Mirror Man hangs up the phone ...

Memphis gets out of the car ... He goes after Kip ... Finds him in

one of the containers ... Grabs him by the collars ...

And Kip looks at him... Tears fall from the younger boy's eyes ...

And Kip looks so lost ... So like a little kid...

And Kip does ... He walks to Memphis ... And Memphis puts his arms

around him... And that's it. The floodgates open. Kip begins to

sob. Deep, painful, racking sobs. And then:

And they hold each other ...

And they stay in the embrace... And then Memphis unwraps Kip's

arms from around him...

Kip nods, sniffles ... Memphis walks out of the container ... He

strides up to the others ... Glances at Toby's clipboard, with all

the cars crossed-out ... He goes to Sway...

And she nods ... And climbs into one of the Escorts... And off

they go ... The others standing around the 'Vette and Toby's

body...

ANGLE - THE CLIPBOARD. One car left. Eleanor.

As a SUPER on-screen reads: PART IV: DREAMS OF YOU

EXT. INTERNATIONAL TOWERS - DAWN

The sun just starting to take all the purple from the night ...

Detectives Castlebeck and Drycoff are parked across from the

towers in their unmarked...

Sway pulls up a few blocks away ... Memphis has put on a fake

moustache, wig, necktie ...

She nods ... He looks at her ...

And she smiles sadly ...

She takes his hand ... Squeezes it ...

Memphis, now in gray flannel suit, wig and moustache, steps out.

As he heads for the Tower garage...

IN THE UNMARKED

Drycoff is on the radio ... Binoculars up, on the Escort's license

plate - 635 CKG ...

They wait ... Sway drives off ...

INT. INTERNATIONAL TOWERS GARAGE

Memphis walks along the cars ... At last, he finds her --

Eleanor.

EXT. INTERNATIONAL TOWERS - DAY

Castlebeck and Drycoff ...

He points ... The '67 Mustang appears at the top of the garage

ramp ... Brakes ... Waiting for the light ... Castlebeck squints...

Raises the binocs ... Tough to tell.. Memphis drifts into the stream

of traffic ...

Drycoff hits the lights and sirens ... Memphis sees the car behind

him...

And kicks it into gear...

He pins it ... And THE RACE IS ON... In the biggest way possible.

This is the grand-daddy of chase scenes here, so we won't take the

easy way out. We'll actually script it ... Memphis races out onto

the busy street, Drycoff on his ass.

Drycoff pulls up alongside him... So they can see him. But the wig

and moustache prevent them from recognizing Memphis ... Other cars

suffer from the pursuit ... They go careening into parked cars,

storefronts, Harvard Square ...

Memphis side-swipes Drycoff's car ... Memphis drives down the

Memorial Drive OFF-RAMP, against traffic

Memphis races her down an alleyway... And we HEAR, as we will

throughout, the VOICE of the

Eleanor races past The Queen Mary ... crossing the bridge into

Long Beach ... She flies down the street ... Memphis, removing his

wig and moustache as he goes... Another POLICE CAR has joined

Drycoff and Castlebeck...

INT. KISS-108 RADIO STATION - DAY

The jocular drive-time jock MATTY IN THE MORNING - is broadcasting

in his studio ...

EXT. ELEANOR - MOVING - MEMPHIS

Has the radio on ... Hears Matty ... He serpentines his way

through the tangle of alleys...

Drycoff does his best to follow. Another CRUISER has joined up.

Memphis is driving like Richard Petty...

INT. LONG BEACH POLICE STATION - DAY

Two dozen COPS sit in the muster room listening to the dispatch.

The cops look at each other. Holy shit! And race for the exit.

Because Mt. Vernon and Cambridge is the address of

THE LONG BEACH POLICE STATION

where there are literally 15 POLICE CARS parked out front... And

Memphis has just arrived...

Watch the mad scramble as COPS dive into their units... And try to

get out of each other's way... Fenders crunch ... Cops curse.

Memphis bootlegs - going reverse down the wrong way. Left on

Cambridge ... Left onto City Hall Plaza --

CITY HALL PLAZA

is 10 ACRES OF BRICK in the heart of downtown ... And now it's

like a demolition derby... As Drycoff/Castlebeck and some 4 SQUAD CARS

are chasing Memphis around the Plaza ...

A POLICE CHOPPER has arrived on the scene... Camera out. Memphis

takes one more spin around the plaza, then sees a

SHALLOW FLIGHT OF STAIRS by the back entrance to City.Hall. And he

takes them... CLUMP-KUMP-KA-DUMP-DUMP-DUMP

And now he's on some of the narrowest streets in Long Beach. He

flies through them... A mad mouse in a maze ... INT. KISS-108 -

MATTY IN THE MORNING

watches the chase on TV, via Copter-cam. Still broadcasting.

EXT. FREEWAY

Memphis races along He's got 4 SQUAD CARS ON HIM

He takes the Kneeland Street exit... And he's run out of road at

A SHOPPING DISTRICT

where vehicle traffic ends. Foot traffic only ... Here com the

cops... Memphis spins the wheel ... And he drives onto PUBLIC PARK...

Across the grounds ... Past the dew-drenched flora and the paddle

boats lolling on the lagoon ...

Only there are SQUAD CARS coming from this side too... And he's

pinned. Police on the perimeters, He slows to a stop.

Cops jump out of their cars, guns drawn. Memphis in the center.

And Castlebeck is on the BULLHORN:

Memphis considers his options ... He sees the FOOT BRIDGE over the

lagoon ... Hears the radio ...

Memphis takes out his cell phone ... Dials...

INT. KISS-108

The COORDINATING PRODUCER comes into the booth ...

Matty scrambles for the phone --

INT. ELEANOR - PARK

Memphis in the middle of the gauntlet ... On the phone ...

Memphis hangs up ... Hears:

And he plays Chuck Berry's "No Particular Place To Go" And

Memphis smiles ...

And punches the gas ... Going right at Castlebeck and the others

... Smashing through the squad cars ... And ACROSS THE FOOT

BRIDGE, over the swan boats ...

Is it ever. Memphis drives out of the park.. And gets onto

ANOTHER FREEWAY

Ten lanes of gnarly superhighway ... He opens her up... Full

throttle ... The chopper above him ...

INT. OTTO'S SALVAGE - DAY

The gang is watching on the TV... Freaking out ... ANGLE - KIP. He

slips out of the place. No one's noticed him go...

EXT. FREEWAY - TOLL BOOTH

ahead. Eleanor crashes the gate going 98, to borrow a

phrase. But he' s driving too close to the shoulder, and he

SMASHES INTO A LIGHT POLE -- ! The car does a 180 ...

Landing with a horrible THUD ... And here come the cops ...

Memphis is wobbly... Looks like he's almost through. Thirty cop

cars idle behind him...

Spins her around... And goes

CASTLEBECK AND DRYCOFF

climb back into their car ...

CLOSE ON - CASTLEBECK. Because he's got a sick feeling who.

ELEANOR

takes an exit ... And speeds on through the with everyone in

pursuit ...

EXT. HARBOR TUNNEL EASTERN TERMINUS

It's quite a road block. A DOZEN SQUAD CARS. A WOODEN BARRICADE

... The whole shebang...

EXT. TUNNEL - ELEANOR

eating asphalt ... Coming to the tunnel's mouth ... To the road

block ... Memphis pins her ... ZOOOOOM! Dead-on to the roadblock

... And, at the last moment, as the COPS dive out of the way --

Memphis bangs the gear shift into neutral -- And yanks the parking

brake -- And the mustang spins on the straight --(and yes, this is

exactly like our opening) Screeching spin ... It stops inches from

the road block ...

Beat ... Thirty squad cars stop behind him ...

Sure it has. Memphis' foot SLAMS ON Eleanor's pedal ... SMASHING

THROUGH THE ROADBLOCK... Cars and cops flying ... And the Dispatch

guy is getting pissed.

EXT. LONG BEACH BRIDGE

A huge suspension bridge spanning the harbor ... Except that on

the Long Beach side, therehas been a terrible ACCIDENT ... An

eleven-car PILE UP ...

Paramedics ... RAMP TRUCKS hauling away wrecked cars ... Fire

engines ... Bloodied VICTIMS ...

EXT. CITY STREETS - ELEANOR

takes it on through the vast construction underway here ... And

here's our money shot: Eleanor. On Route 33. COMING AT US ...

Followed by, literally, 20 POLICE-CARS ... Could be just about the

coolest fucking thing we've ever seen... But before we have time

to gloat:

THE LONG BEACH BRIDGE

Southbound traffic on the bridge (into Long Beach) is at a

stand-still because of the accident... The Northbound side of the bridge

is EMPTY... Northbound traffic stopped at the accident ...

Memphis comes to a stop 100 feet before the accident ... There is

no way past it, onto the bridge ... All the cops behind him come

to a screeching halt. He is truly trapped.

DETECTIVE DRYCOFF

is thrilled ...

But Castlebeck's not so sure ... He sees a possible play... So

does

MEMPHIS

Heavy sigh... He shuts off the radio ... And there's a strange

SILENCE... As everyone waits ... Watches ...

QUICK CUTS TO --

-- Matty In The Morning -- The gang at Otto's -- The Carpenter in

his wood shop -- Helen Raines, in front of her TV -- The chopper

cops -- Paramedics, cops, injured motorists, fire men --

Castlebeck and Drycoff... BACK TO

MEMPHIS RAINES AND ELEANOR...

Another few beats of silence ... Everyone watching ... He punches

the gas... Ripping down to the accident site... Heading straight

for it ... And we fear he aims to smash the site, maybe further

injure the accident victims -

Not our Memphis ... He's heading straight for

THE RAMP TRUCK

parked ass-end toward Long Beach ... Ramp down ... Memphis rockets

Eleanor at the ramp truck's ramp... Straight on ... And the ramp

LAUNCHES ELEANOR in glorious super-sexy-bloodpumping SLO-MO OVER

THE ACCIDENT SITE some thirty feet in the air ... Evel-style ...

Where she lands in a crippling thud... Onto the EMPTY side of the

Long Beach Bridge... Cheers from the gang at Otto's ... The gang

at KISS-108 ... Memphis pulls her to a stop... Looks back at the

scene ...

Castlebeck squints ... Trying to see if it's his boy... Memphis

switches the radio back on ... Matty has obliged... Wilson

Pickett's "Mustang Sallyo ... And Memphis drives over the bridge,

the only car going northbound... Memphis rides, daddy, rides ...

INT. WOODBURN CONSTRUCTION - FRONT OFFICES - DAY

A half-dozen Calitri SOLDIERS are here, answering phones, playing

cards.

INT. WOODBURN CONSTRUCTION - WORKSHOP

The sliding door is open. The CASKET for Kip rests to the side ...

Calitri uses a router to make a rabbet along the bottom frame of a

plywood gossip bench. He senses something and turns to

THE LOADING DOCK - MEMPHIS

has driven up in the smashed-to-shit Eleanor ... He climbs up,

entering the workshop... Calitri glances to the wallclock: 7:55

AM...

He gestures to a Haliburton case ... Memphis opens it ... There's

a lot of cash inside...

Memphis looks at him... Calitri smiles ...

Calitri goes to the FAX machine... Tears off the sheet..

Calitri grins. But then his smile goes south, as he sees, for the

first time -- ELEANOR -- parked out on the loading dock. And she

is smashed-to-shit.

Memphis is by a TABLE SAW... He flicks it on. The electric MOTOR

rumbles, so as to obfuscate, any noise in here ...

And Memphis is on him... They go rolling about in grunts and

groans - eddies of sawdust swirling - the NOISE of the table saw

drowning out the sounds of combat ...

Calitri is on top, grabbing an AWL from the floor, bringing the

lethal point down to Memphis' face... Memphis holds Calitri's

wrist, straining, the point inches from his eye

ANGLE - FLOOR SOCKET - right above Memphis' head. With a last

gasp, Memphis misdirects the awl so it STABS THE FLOOR SOCKET - a

small CLAP OF VOLTAGE shaking through their bodies, as they sprawl

akimbo ...

Both men are momentarily paralyzed as the electricity sorts itself

out inside of them... Calitri is up; and he's found the gun ...

He crawls over to Memphis, climbing on him, sitting down hard on

the younger man's chest ... But then Memphis grabs him by the hair

and tosses Calitri off him ... Memphis POUNDS Calitri's head into

the floor ...

Once, twice. Three times. Calitri is out ... Memphis gets to his

feet, nose bloody. He catches his breath. Only the door opens ...

And Atley is there ...

But before Memphis can respond, there are APPROACHING ENGINE

SOUNDS from up the alleyway -- as A PANEL VAN arrives. Memphis and

Atley look at the wall-clock. 8:05. A glance to the unconscious

Calitri ...

And the two men hold the look... And the van doors slam, as Digger

and Butz, Calitri's grave-diggers, get out ... Atley goes to the

unconscious Calitri ... And he picks him up, straining under the

dead weight ... Dragging the don over to

THE OPEN CASKET - One final burst of strength and Atley drops

Calitri into the casket... Slamming the swell top lid of the

coffin. He turns to look at the shocked Memphis -- As Digger and

Butz are there -

Atley gestures to the coffin. And they pick it up, move it to the

van...

And they are gone ... And Atley turns to Memphis

And he holds out his hand ... And they shake ...

And Memphis does ... Nods to Atley...

Atley nods ... Memphis walks out to the loading dock... Atley

watches him go ...

EXT. CALITRI'S WORKSHOP - LOADING DOCK

Memphis walks to the battered Eleanor ... As Pearl Jam's

"Rearviewmirror' crunches and a CAR comes motoring up to him. It's

ANOTHER 167 SHELBY. ANOTHER ELEANOR, a "For Sale" sign pasted on

the back window. It's being driven by Kip...

Kip does. Memphis gets behind the wheel. Drives...

EXT. LONG BEACH BOULEVARD - DAY

Memphis drives... Kip beside him...

Memphis nods. But then FLASHING LIGHTS behind them ... An UNMARKED

with Code 3 capabilities - lights & sirens ... Memphis considers

... He could make another run ... But the looks at Kip... Enough

is enough ... He pulls over ...

The unmarked pulls up behind him... The cop comes over ... It is,

of course, Detective Castlebeck.

Castlebeck opens his coat... Showing stuffed holster ...

Memphis starts to get out. When Castleback's RADIO crackles.

Castlebeck frowns, goes to his radio. Memphis looks at Kip.

Memphis is impressed...

ANGLE - CASTLEBECK at his car, on the radio ...

And Castlebeck looks at the license on this Eleanor... A vanity

plate that says - MY 67 ...

And he goes back over to Memphis ...

Memphis can barely believe it. Castlebeck leans down, to Kip:

Castlebeck sighs...

Castlebeck nods ...

And Memphis races off ...

EXT. OTTO'S SALVAGE - DAY

Otto, The Sphinx, Tumbler, Freb and Mirror Man are sipping coffee

and eating donuts ... They are exhausted... Memphis and Kip pull

up in Eleanor... He hands Otto the briefcase. Otto opens it... All

that cash...

He nods ... The boys are huddled together...

A few beats of silence as they remember; then shockingly:

They all stare at him, stunned...

The Sphinx shrugs...

But The Sphinx lapses back into his silence ... Nibbles a donut

... Sips coffee ... Memphis smiles ... He takes a stack of bills

from the briefcase... To Kip:

And he hands Kip the cash ...

Kip nods ... Memphis looks at a grinning Otto ...

He smiles. The others do, too. Memphis heads for Eleanor.

Memphis turns back...

Memphis nods ...

And we PRE-LAP Sammy John's "Chevy Van" and CUT TO:

INT. BACCHIOCHI'S FOREIGN MOTORS - DAY

Sway, underneath a Daytona... We only see her from the waist down

... Hands on her waist ... Pulls her gently out. Memphis. He

brings her to her feet ...

And he uses a rag to tenderly wipe a small black smear of oil from

her cheek...

She looks at him... Long and hard...

EXT. BACCHIOCHI'S - DAY

And Memphis opens the passenger door for her ... And she gets

in... And she smiles ... And Memphis climbs behind the wheel. He

neutral-drops Eleanor, chirping off ...

EXT. CONTAINER SHIP - LONG BEACH HARBOR - DAY

As two TUGS guide the giant freighter away from the docks ... All

those containers ... Filled with cars ... But here comes a COAST

GUARD CUTTER ... Churning for the ship ...

Detectives Castlebeck and Drycoff on the deck ... Stopping this

one cold...

EXT. LANDFILL - RHODE ISLAND - DAY

A vast expanse of trash and garbage and layers of earth. Deserted,

except for THE PANEL VAN parked dead center. Digger and Butz slide

the casket from the van, parked before an ALREADY DUG GRAVE.

As they move the casket, a KNOCKING from inside. A POUNDING. And

muffled CRIES. Digger and Butz exchange a horrified glance... They

stare at the casket, spooked.

And just as we think they're sure to open it -- they DROP THE

CASKET INTO THE HOLE -- !

And begin to dump shovelfuls of earth upon it; its unseen occupant

thumping and pounding and yelling -- And soon the casket is

covered in dirt. Gone.

And we PRE-LAP The Turtles' pop gem "Eleanor" ("You got a thing

about you/I just can't live without you/I really want

you/ Eleanor near me...")  CUT TO:

EXT. THE 405 FREEWAY NORTH - ELEANOR - MOVING - DAY

Memphis driving. Sway riding shotgun. Long Beach at their backs

... Memphis looks quite enthralled behind the wheel... He loves

driving this car. Sway watches him. He feels it --

And he grins ... Pats the seat beside him... And Sway slides

close... He throws his arm around her ...

And off they go ... As The Turtles' ("Eleanor/Gee, I think you're

swell/And you really do me well/You're my pride and joy, etc.")

SING ON... And we hear:

And Eleanor drives away from us ... Into the searing horizon line

... Becoming just another single, yellow dot in the pointillist

pattern that is the American road.

THE END
