WHILE WE'RE IN BLACK we HEAR a PNEUMATIC "KA-CHUNK" and then

Holy shit, whoa, whoa -

1 EXT. DULLES TERMINAL - DAY 1

JOHN MCCLANE, long topcoat FLAPPING, comes running out of the

terminal towards an AIRPORT COP in plastic covered uniform who is

supervising a TOW TRUCK DRIVER who in turn is manhandling a

sedate sedan with Virginia plates and a "GRANDMOTHER ON BOARD"

sign on the rear window.

I'm here, I'm here, false alarm, let's

just let her down nice and easy -

Sure. At the impound lot.

Next time, read the sign.

You don't understand, I'm just meeting

my wife's-plane - you gotta give me

this car back.

Sure. Tomorrow 8 to four, you pay

40 bucks, we give it back.

This is my mother in law's car. She

BEEP drowns out his last word. McClave sweeps aside his coat,

finds the beeper on his belt. He looks at the obviously

unfamilar number on the read out in puzzlement, then runs into

the terminal.

2 INT. DULLES TERMINAL - DAY 2

CHRISTMAS MUSIC wafting through the building from a SCHOOL CHOIR

perched in front of a massive, three-story window. Blase

travelers PAUSE in their hectic rush to applaud the angelic

voices.

McClane shoves his way through some people - when they GLARE at

him he quickly APPLAUDS the kids, pulls up at an INFORMATION

BOOTH - the girl there is watching a LITTLE TV on the shelf out

of sight from the public.

EXT. AIRPORT - THROUGH WINDOW - SAME TIME

A plane TAKES OFF. We PULL BACK and realize we're in a MOTEL

ROOM. The TV is on and we SEE the TV PICTURE CHANGE to a

TROPICAL AIRFIELD. Khaki-clad heavily armed SOLDIERS form a

cordon as a stiff-backed handsome MAN of 60 in handcuffs and leg

chains is hustled aboard a plane.

Security was tight today at Escalon

airport in the Republic of Val Verde,

where government authorities escorted

General Ramon Esperanza to the

military transport that will bring

him to the United States to stand

trial for narcotics trafficking.

A HAND thrusts in front of the CAMERA - FINGERS clenching and

curling oddly.

A half naked MAN is doing Tai Ch'i EXERCISES. This is COLONEL

WILLIAM STUART, U.S.A. (Ret.) His body is hard, with SCARS from

knives and bullets.

On the TV, the words "FILE TAPE" blink under Esperanza's IMAGE,.

here resplendent in a Latin American uniform, reviewing troops in

the field and then moving to a table under a tarp to sign

documents with American military officers. He hands a COLONEL the

pen just used on the document - a souvenir.

Only two years ago the controversial

General lead his country's Army in

its campaign against Communists

insurgents - a campaign fought with

American money and advisors.

Esperanza's fall from power caused

ripples not only in his country'.s

recent election, but closer to home

his hand is the remote control, snatched from the nightstand.

It clicks OFF -

HOLLY MCCLANE is here, AirPhone at her ear and a beautiful

SUNSET over the plane's wing visible through the nearby window.

With the Compaq portable computer, filofax and calculator piled

on it, Holly'.s seat back table looks like a traveling office.

Hello. This is Lieutenant McClane

- Somebody there beep me?

I'd like to think I'm somebody.

Holly! Did you land?

John, wake up. It's the nineties.

Microchips, microwaves, faxes and

airphones.

As far as I'm concerned, progress

peaked with the frozen pizza.

We're going to land about thirty

minutes late, I wanted you to know.

Kids okay?

Just speeding on sugar, thanks to

your parents. I really appreciate

you coming a day late, honey. Nothing

I like better than a weekend with

No... not yet. Uh...how 'bout if

the river and through the woods to

Grandma's house, but check into the

Airport motel?

You're on, Lieutenant.

They both hang up. The OLDER WOMAN beside Holly smiles at her.

Isn't technology wonderful?

My husband doesn't think so.

Well, I do. I used to carry around

those awful mace things -

She opens her purse and displays a Taser stun gun.

Now it's Stuart's turn to look at McClane oddly; then he moves

off. McClane looks after him, trying to place him... shrugs...

heads for the bar.

17 A LITTLE SEMI-RURAL CHURCH - NEAR THE AIRPORT 17

Charming until the SUB WOOFER ROAR of a big jet SCREAMS by,

practically in the little church's backyard.

Now we notice that the church is a little run down - trim needing

paint, sidewalk cracked - and a neat SIGN confirms our

"FUTURE SITE OF PARISH DAY CARE CENTER.

WORSHIP WITH US AT OUR NEW CHURCH,

52 KENSINGTON ROAD, ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA."

A DWP VAN pulls up, snow tires CRUNCHING on the driveway here.

Two MEN (BAKER and THOMPSON) get out in official DWP wardrobe.

But we remember the trim bodies, trimmer hair... and we remember

those gift wrapped packages, - which one of these guys carries.

18 INSIDE THE CHURCH 18

On a TV here, the newscast CONTINUES, now back to the tropical

airport. Esperanza is at the top of the steps, waving to the

press like a triumphant hero - not a felon en route to prison.

The plane doors close and it taxis down the runway.

WIDEN from the set, which an elderly CUSTODIAN is watching while

he eats some instant soup. The DOORBELL RINGS. The custodian

answers it.

Yes? (on TV)

Baker and Thompson glance at each other.

Would you mind if we take a look?

Help yourself.

18A WIDER 18A

The three men walk down the main aisle of the church. Dust motes

dance in the colored light.

Don't seem right, somehow, closing

a church down. Oh, I know the parish

is gonna keep using it, but it won't

be the same. Been here a lot of

years; and I been right here with

it.

They've arrived at a rear window. FOCUS CHANGE to a green

CONDUIT BOX on the the church's rear lawn, half covered in snow.

FOCUS back through the glass. Thompson looks questioningly at

Baker, who nods.

Yep. I kinda feel a part of me is

dying along with this church.

Well, you're right about that.

BLAM BLAM GLAM. BULLETS RIP through the end of the Christmas

package, SLAM the custodian up and into a row of pews, which

OVERTURN.

{ Baker rips the rest of the smoking package away from his weapon,

s 1i s it over his shoulder and begins to SHOVE the pews aside to

make a larger open area.

Thompson, meanwhile, takes out a very futuristic transceiver.

He turns it ON; getting a RED light; enters a NUMBER CODE on the

keypad and gets a GREEN LIGHT. There's an EERIE QUALITY to the

transmission.

This is team one. We're here.

This is Leonard Adkins, in Val Verde

- where the war on drugs has finally

taken its first prisoner.

With an annoyed expression, Thompson CLICKS OFF the newscast.

Two PAINTERS pull up in a van. Move around the back and start to

Need something?

Yeah.

BAM! BAM! Both painters are SHOT.

Quickly, the two men toss their bodies into the rear, get into

the van... and BACK IT INTO the airport garage.

O'Reilly enters a NUMBER CODE into a transceiver-

WIDEN from McClane at the bar, his coat on a stool beside him.

He's on his second scotch. On the BAR TV, we SEE SAMANTHA

("SAM") COPELAND, a reporter with "live" super'd over her body.

She is clearly somewhere inside this airport

JACKETS come into the bar. Seeing, them, the bartender is

Excuse me, officers. This may be

a total wild goose chase, but I think

I just saw -

Quickly, he FOLLOWS Cochrane downwards - into

where a TOURIST JUNKET gets between McClane and his quarry-

38 C9CC $ANE 38

a GLIMPSE of him at a door marked "NO ADMITTANCE" - then he's

gone. McClane runs up, too late; the door is shut again.

He looks around, sees a LUGGAGE WORKER, flashes his badge.

Open this.

(as the guy obeys)

Got a cop on duty around here?

Airport police -

Get 'em.

39 INT. LUGGAGE CONVEYOR AREA - DAY 39

Dark. Clatters and bumps, machine sounds... more bumps. McClane

moves cautiously along. He JUMPS as a large SHADOW moves

nearby, but it's a big CASE on a conveyor belt.

Now, he stoops to go under another conveyor belt - the different

tracks intersect and pass each other like freeway off-ramps

discharging luggage from one to another - and then he SEES -

39A COCHRANE AND MILLER 39A

One has his jacket off, and just now dusts off his hands like

a man finishing a job.

The other one has one of those transceivers.

Excuse me.

They turn, see McClane with his badge in his left hand - his

right hidden under the long coat which is draped over his

shoulder like Clint Eastwood's serape in a Spaghetti Western.

This is a restricted area. You boys

too impatient to wait for the skycaps?

We... work for th amine.

MCCLAN.E

Yeah? Let's see some ID -

Instantly both men DIVE to the outside, drawing guns.

Falls, skids... somewhere.

43 BACK TO SCENE 43

Dropping his'wallet, McClane JUMPS aside as SHOTS WHIZZ PAST

-McClane's COAT takes the BULLET HITS in MID AIR as he LANDS

on a conveyor belt, which CARRIES him UP and OVER the gunmen.

They FIRE UP at him - He aims.back - and then a SUITCASE falling

from another belt and knocks his gun away!

The gun CLATTERS on the floor. Seeing it, the two men exchange a

glance - split up.

Drops from the belt, crouches near big gears. Desperate, he

looks around for a weapon, anything. Then he notices all the

luggage going past: Suitcases, camera cases, a bicycle... Skis.

Moving forward expertly, gun ready. WHAP! A SKI POLE smacks

down on his wrist! The gun DROPS onto a conveyor belt, FIRES -

then moves away, obscured by moving luggage.

J McClane steps in, punches Miller - gets HIT hard himself -both

ROLL OVER onto the new belt.

Hearing the SHOT, he tries to pinpoint the location - but with

all the echoes - it's hard.

Fighting hand to hand. Miller starts pressing the ski pole

against McClane's throat:-Pt=lane tries to do the same thine

rIT into view with fucking HAIRSPRAY right in the guy's eyes!

Miller HOWLS, blinded - but then - BLAM! A BULLET EXPLODES

tcan in McClane's hand!

Cochrane is there! McClane LEAPS like Tarzan to the BOTTOM of

the i , empty "return" belt - the momentum swings him right

towards Cochrane, who FIRES once more before McClane's KICK

nearly toc e stf'his head - he loses the gun, but Jesus, these

guys are tough and now Cochrane LEAPS UP and grabs McClane's

belt and clothes and they're both hanging -suddenly they're both

too damn high to get off!

Half on the belt, half off, he fends off the other man and SEES-

The belt goes through a hatchway - a hatchway with virtually no

clearance.

52 BACK TO SCENE 52

McClane PUNCHES Cochrane - again, again - but the guy's gonna

kill them both one way or the other - McClane KICKS him, again,

airplanes, so we store them and their

luggage in some other "somewhere"?

Hell, why don't we shut down the whole

fucking airport? Whaddya think they'll

say upstairs when I tell them that?

Why don't you try it and find out?

Because I don't need a forensics

investigation to file away some punk

stealing luggage -

Luggage? That "punk" pulled a Glock

McClane comes out of Lorenzo's office, steaming. He walks down

and casually examines the military chronometer on his handcuffed (X)

wrist. We PUSH IN on it. (X)

73 INT. VIRGINIA CHURCH 73

WIDEN from Stuart's Huer, showing the exact same time. Now we

SEE that the church is full of ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT: In fact,

it looks very much like a mini-version of an airport control

tower, complete with radar screens and a big glass board to mark

positions on.

CAMERA follows a MAN with a Pizza sized RADAR DISH as he crosses

the room, a CRONY unrolling WIRE behind him.

CRANE UP as the man CLIMBS into the STEEPLE... UP, UP, UP, until

he's in the BELFRY where a PRERIGGED TRIPOD WAITS for the dish.

As he CLAMPS it in place we SEE the yard behind the church and

the SPARKLE of WELDING TOOLS; someone is making CONNECTIONS

to the now open conduit box and underground CABLES.

74 INT. TERMINAL - RENT A CAR COUNTER 74

Excuse me, honey - can I borrow your

office for a minute?

Before she can answer, he's over the counter and reaching for her

phone.

75 INT. LAPD OFFICE - NIGHT 75

The office he's in shows us that AL POWELL has moved up in the

world - and Twinkies have move up along with him.

(swallowing, answering

76 MCCLANE - AT RENT A CAR COUNTER - INTERCUT 76

Hey, partner. Get that twinky out

of your mouth and grab a pencil.

John, how you doing? How's the

vacaction treating you?

Vacation? Holly stood me up for a

last minute meeting. I'm alone in

DC with the in-laws.

Ah, the in-laws. They love their

policemen son-in-laws, don't they?

550-3212. This is a first.

Yeah, well my wife's company makes

'em, I figure it's time to get one

of them pregnant.

(aside to girl)

This way?

This way.

The FAX starts to leave McClane - voila, it's already arriving at

Powell's office.

(as it arrives)

Fingerprints?

From a stiff down here at Dulles.

I marked the whorls with a pen in

case the transmission's fuzzy. Can

you run that through State and Federal

for me - throw in Interpol if you

got it.

Will do. What's this about?

I don't know. Just a feeling.

Ouch. You get those feelings

insurance companies start to go

bankrupt.

The FAX number is uh -

-on the top edge of the transmission

he just got -

-on the top edge of your transmission.

Airport, huh? You're not pissing

in somebody's little pool, are you?

Break out the chlorine.

77 INT. HOLLY'S PLANE 77

I don't think so.

I only have to look at his face for

fifteen more minutes.

Ladies and Gentlemen, I've just been

informed by Dulles traffic control

that a new weather front is moving

in ahead of us. We may be up here

for a little while longer...

GROANS. COMPLAINTS. Holly holds out her glass.

78 INT. RENT ACAR BOOTH 78

McClane paces, smoking. RRING. Both the FAX machine and the

telephone light up. McClane beats her to it.

Al?

79 POWELL - IN HIS OFFICE - INTERCUT 79

Right here, partner. Your stiff's

dossier is coming through right now.

What can you tell me?

He's dead.

You needed a computer for that?

No, you don't follow me. According

to the Department of Defense, he's

been dead for 2 years.

What?

Yup. S/Sgt. Oswald Cochrane.

American advisor in Honduras, killed

in helicopter accident 5/11/88.

(reading the page)

Read between the lines of his military

record and it looks like a lot of

black bag stuff.

Yeah, I see it. Thanks a lot, Al.

I owe you.

He hangs up. The girl gives him the eye.

Say, I close in an hour... maybe we

could...

(showing his wedding ring)

Just the FAX,, ma'am. Just the FAX.

80 EXT. RENT A CAR AREA 80

McClane comes out, deep in thought - gets on an walkway.

Suddenly the CLICK of HEELS makes him turn.

Sam Coleman is trotting down the linoleum next to the walkway,

trying to keep up with him.

The Ghost of Christmas Past.

Nakatomi? LA? You're John McClane,

right?

Depends who you are.

Sam Coleman, WADC news -

(as McClane REACTS)

Hey, I know how you feel about the

media, but we're not all like that

putz Thornberg - he crossed the line.

That's why they canned him out in

LA.

Yeah. Now he's on the Network

interviewing Transsexual Gum Surgeons

and laughing all the way to the bank.

Okay. The guy makes Geraldo look

like Walter Chronkite. Doesn't mean

you can't cut me some slack. I saw

the stiff. Word is that was your

handiwork.

Nah. I do needlepoint.

And he's at the end of the walkway and he quickly disappears

into the crowd, leaving Sam pissed, puzzled... and out of

breath.

81 INT. "THE CAB" - NIGHT 81

Lorenzo has joined the regulars here to cover his ass

-well, the press was here, crawling

all over the Esperanza story... so

they got it right on the fucking news,

bloodstains and all...

Couldn't be helped, I guess. What

was it, gangs?

Yeah... if your gangs get their

training at Fort Bragg.

(pushing past Lorenzo)

I'm a police officer, Mr. Trudeau-

L.A., Mr. Lorenzo-don't mean shit-

That's what I said about my last

cholesterol test. What's your problem-

Lieutenant McClane?

I think something serious is going

to happen here tonight -

Hey. Something serious happens every

night, only it doesn't make the

newspapers. Ever see those guys

on TV, juggling knives and cha n

i saws? That's what we're doing with

those planes up there, only we do

it one handed 'cause the other hand's

playing 3 card monte with the planes

on the ground.

Anybody try and fix the deck tonight?

(on his look)

Anything weird going on besides the

shooting?

We did. lose FAA approach control-

What's that?

One way we manage the planes. But

we've got backup -

Long look from McClane.

83 EXT. VIRGINIA CHURCH - BACK YARD 83

Burke turns off his acetyline torch, flips up his face shield.

We're hot!

84 INT. VIRGINIA CHURCH 84

Light it up.

Signal is given. Switches are thrown. CAMERA PANS OVER-and

UP to the CHOIR LOFT, which is electronic heaven. EVERYTHING

COMES ON LINE.

5 minutes to zero hour. Stand by.

85 INT. CAB - NIGHT 85

Okay. You clot back-up - back-up

for everything you think can go wrong.

What about something nobody

anticipated? Not accidents, not

(a bit dryly)

The human element..?

Damned straight the human element.

You've got the world's biggest drug

dealer on the way, one body and a'-

lot of questionsl Doesn't anyone

want to look for answers?

(after a moment)

Lorenzo. Have all your shift

Commanders report in... now.

What? You're buying into this -

I want them to report anything out

of the ordinary --no matter how

trivial. You got that?

(annoyed, but obeying)

I got it.

Oh, my God...

Everyone turns at the chill in Barne's voice.

What is it?

86 REVERSE ANGLE - OVER THEIR SHOULDERS 86

Slowly, without any fuss, and with a pattern of sorts that would

be pretty if the impact wasn't so frightening... slowly, ALL THE

RUNWAY LIGHTS ARE GOING OUT.

Jesus...

87 INT. VIRGINIA CHURCH - SAME TIME 87

As Stuart's TECH throws more and more SWITCHES -

- and more and more runways go DARK.

Go to emegency lighting... now! (X)

Emergencies! Controllers, Code (X)

Yellow!

People leap into action... meanwhile, Trudeau and the others MOVE

around the tower, the CAMERA FOLLOWING in a 180 TURN, watch as

the LIGHTS KEEP GOING OUT.

Back up systems won't come up-!

Shunt to another terminal!

This ain't software, boss -

Maybe we should call the power

company...?

We're on the same Goddamn grid and

we're hot!

Already the SPEAKER BOXES are beginning to CHATTER -

(panicked) Dulles Tower, this is TWA

Dulles, what's going on? 23 -what the hell happened

I'm in approach - - to you -?

Checked all systems. It ain't

happening.

And now, God help us, all REACT to ANOTHER ALARM.

89 IN THE VIRGINIA CHURCH 89

A CABLE yanked from the ground gets CUT, SPARKING -

WHIP PAN to an ENGINEER -

Approach control backup! It's gone!

91 IN THE CHURCH'S BACKYARD - SAME TIME 91

GLOWING FIBER OPTIC CABLE stretched like a sacrifice on a BLOCK

-AXE BLADE swoops down - SPARKS. The LIGHT DIES -

92 IN THE CAB - SAME TIME 92

Confirmed! ILS is dead - every

Goddamn system is dead!

(quick, commanding)

Jacoby, Strauss. Get your controllers

on the horn - every plane approaching

our Vortacs that's not in our pattern

yet gets turned away'now. Everyone

already inside our patrn holds at

the outer marker. Stack 'em, pack

'em, and rack 'em. Move.

(to another man)

I want every off duty controller and

technician here in five minutes.

Page the terminal - no, better, beep

them.

McClane. This what you were

expecting?

This? This ain't it, pal. This is

just the beginning.

A PHONE RINGS. CAMERA ADJUSTS. It's a prominent RED PHONE.

FAA hotline -!

How could they know already -?

Maybe they don't.

Maybe... it's them.

(a look at McClane, then;)

Put it on speaker.

Attention, Dulles Tower. Attention,

Dulles Tower -

93 INT. VIRGINIA CHURCH NIGHT 93

Stuart is using a phone that's PATCHED IN to the cables ripped

from the earth -

I think by now I've got your

attention. I know your recorders

go 24 hours around the clock, so I'll

be quick -you can play me back later

all you want.

94 INT. CAB - INTERCUT 94

How. did you get on this line? Who

is this?

Who I am is unimportant. What I

want... well, if you don't want those

planes overhead to start dropping

like flies when they run out of

fuel... what I want is very

important.

All REACT - McClane as much as anyone.

A plane is going to be landing at

this Airport in 58 minutes. It is

FM 1 - Foreign Military 1.

Esperanza?

Trudeau nods -

This plane is scheduled to be met

by a continigent from the U.S.

Justice-department. But now there

will be a change of plans. This plane

will not be met by anyone. It will

land on a runway of my designation

where it will not be molested. That

will conclude my interest in that

plane and your responsibility for

it. At the same time, I want a 747

cargo conversion fully fueled.

As Trudeau tries to make headway with Stuart, McClave leans over

to Barnes.

What's all that about?

A 747 has the furthest flight

capacity of anything we've got here.

Take out the seats and save some

weight, add the wing tanks and it

could go to Australia, Africa, Asia

- hell the whole Goddamn world.'

Meaning they pull Esperanza off his

plane and take him anywhere there's

no extradition treaties.

They're talking to us on our own

Goddamn system! They gotta be close

- I'll have my men tear this airport

About time, Carmine. Guess you have

to light a fire under your ass to

light a fire under your ass.

McClane, I got a first class unit

here, SWAT team and all, and we don't

need any Monday morning quarterbacks.

(pissed, moving in)

Monday morning? My wife's on one

of those planes these aasstards are

fucking with! That makes me a player

on the fucking field, you putz! And

if you got off your fat ass when I

told you to, maybe we wouldn't be

knee deep in shit right now!

(turning, shouting)

Security!

(back to McClane)

You're out of here!

And already two big Airport cops are trotting over. As Trudeau

REACTS, unsure -

Mr. Trudeau. Do I have to remind you

about FAA regulations regarding

unauthorized personnel in the control

tower?

See Mr. McClane out.

96 AT THE ELEVATOR 96

It opens. Someone's inside., but we don't feature them yet.

(as he's muscled in)

Trudeau, can't you see you're dealing

with pros? You can't fuck with these

Sam comes out of the elevator, holding up her ID.

Sam Coleman, WNTW news. Mr. Trudeau,

there's a lot of rumors flying around

Oh, no, no way -

-96 CONTINUED - 96

This is off limits, Coleman, you know

that!

Together with McClane she's shoved into the elevator.

Anything you can think-of, they'll

think of, too!

But the elevator DOORS CLOSE on him and now Lorenzo turns a KEY

on the control panel, then SPEAKS into his walkie talkie.

Lobby Security, come in.

96A AIRPORT - LOBBY - INTERCUT 96A

(into RADIO),

Tomlinson here -

And Lorenzo here, with two

unauthorized personnel in the fucking

tower! Get your thumb out of your

ass and get over to the elevator.

Get them out and post a guard or

you're gonna have a pink slip in your

Christmas stocking!

Rattled, the guard signals a comrade, hustles to obey.

97 IN THE ELEVATOR 97

Anything who can think of? Can't

fuck with.what guys?

McClane punches buttons. But it's on override.

Shit!

Big drug dealer on the way to prison.

Gunfight in airport. Every controller

in the coffee shop getting beeped

and hauling ass, and you rocking the

boat. A connection? Come on, McClane

-Just a few words -?

(opening the control

How about "fuck" and "you"?

I already got that from Colonel

Stuart, thanks -!

McClane STOPS as if zapped by a Taser.

Stuart! The guy who got canned by

Congress - that's who he was-

Huh? Who he who?

But McClane has already jumped up and grabbed the light fixture,

and now in a gymnast's move KICKS out the ceiling hatch and

99 INT. CAB - NIGHT 99

TILT UP from a big map of the airport. Lots of AD-LIB

BRAINSTORMING, some of it breaking through - some how one reedy

hesitant voice cuts through with nothing but confidence

--guys, guys, all we have to do is

find a way to transmit - (X)

Yeah, right. Somebody run down to

Radio Shack and get a transmitter-

We have one.

The new terminal wing they're

building? Twenty airlines when it's

done?

All with their reservation computers,

all tied into a nice big antenna

array so they can talk to their home

offices- it's just sitting there

waiting to go on line -

I 2ND ENGINEER

That's VHF - it'll scatter -

Doesn't matter; The planes we want

to reach are right overhead. I could

rig our frequency in - 30 minutes...

wire in a crossover and we're hot.

The planes wouldn't even know the

difference.

Get what you need. Borrow, steal,

kill.

(heading for the elevator)

I want my Swat team to go with him

as cover.

(firm, tough)

Whatever we can think of - they can

think of, too.

He says it like he thought of it himself. Then -

Attention, Tower. You have two more

minutes to stack the planes in your

inbound pattern over your outside

radio marker. After that you will

be able.to receive only. Any attempt

to restore your systems will be met

by severe penalties.

At the elevator, Lorenzo pauses - stage WHISPERS -

He's bluffing -

Lorenzo leaves. Trudeau ain't so sure.

Damn it, you can't do this -!

I am doing this.

(pause; to Barnes)

Put me on all bands...

Trudeau waits as switches are thrown, and then takes the jack

from the ear/phone he wears and jacks it into a panel.

This is Dulles approach to all

aircraft holding.at Potomic Vortac.

We are experiencing...

Severe technical problems here.

100 INT. VARIOUS CIRCLING AIRCRAFT - COCKPITS - INTERCUT 100

As CONCERNED CREWS in each listen to:

continue holding at the outer marker

as directed and wait for further

instructions. As - as soon as we're

back on line we'll expedite your

landings on a.fuel emergency basis.

Good luck...

God bless.

He turns to a tech, face ashen.

101 INT. DULLES - MAIN TERMINAL - NIGHT 101

ANGLE ON a bank of ARRIVAL MONITORS. Already a quarter of the

planes are DELAYED by weather; but now, in a domino like

PATTERN, all the remaining FLIGHT DATA changes to DELAYED.

CAMERA ADJUSTS to show PEOPLE REACTING with frustration and

concern.

102 INT. DULLES BASEMENT 102

Pretty dark and creepy for a place only 25 years old. A

FLASHLIGHT BEAM PANS THE LENS. We SEE the two lobby guards as

they search the basement. They move AWAY from the CAMERA.

Pause.

McClane APPEARS in the gloom close to CAMERA, clothes now a

little greasy and dirty from his little escape.

(sotto, to himself)

I don't believe this... another

fucking elevator... another fucking

basement... why does this always

happen to me?

He moves through the cavernous maze, and then REACTS to MUSIC.

Moves towards it. And arrives in -

103 AN ... APARTMENT 103

Or something like it: Here, in an area reached only my somebody

with a groundhog in his ancestry, is a space with some battered

chairs, a 3-legged card table, a cot made up with faded but neat

covers, some 50's vintage.(but lovingly scotch taped) PIN UPS,

and a tiny kitchen precariously propped up on a big purple

plumbling valve on the wall.

104 ON A PHONOGRAPH 104

The SOURCE of.the music, a 78 SPINNING on the old machine.

McClane's HAND picks it up and we WIDEN as he looks at it

curiously.

A HAND reaches for McClane's shoulder.

McClane's instincts take over; in a flash, he WHIRLS and his

would be attacker is pinned against a wall. It's a wizened MAN

in his 60's who now raises his hands to show he ain't looking

for trouble.

Who the fuck are you?

In response, the man points to the NAMETAG on his coveralls.

Marvin, I'm Marvin. Thought you was

tryin' to steal my records, that's

all.

He moves to them, possessively.

They're valuble, you know. Me, I

like those old 78's. Won't find me

switching like everybody else to these

new fangled 45's.

McClane reacts to that, peers at him.

You're what, the janitor?

Damn straight. Janitor, and proud

of it. Don't need any of this new

fangled custodial engineer crap.

Just do my job and screw the fancy

talk. You know, you're not supposed

to be down here.

Yeah. Just like you're not supposed

to be living here.

W-who said I was living here?

McClane shows his badge.

Come on, Marvin. I wasn't born

yesterday. Carmine Lorenzo know you

don't go home after you punch out?

L-Lorenzo? C-come on, officer, I

can barely get by, even with my

pension. You know, I'm a vet, WW

2? If it wasn't for guys like me,

you kids' be eatin' sushi today.

I'm just trying to. save a few. bucks

-I could. get fired if you tell.

McClane moves over to a big panel with telephone lines and jacks.

Examines it as he speaks.

I'm a veteran myself, Marvin. And

a married one. You married?

Six times.

My wife may be in some trouble

upstairs. I gotta find out. This

set up of yours? I won't tell a

soul... provided you patch me into

this panel, 'let me eavesdrop on the

tower. What do you say?

CONTINUED.

You a cop or a lawyer?

106 INT. AIRPORT POLICE OFFICE - NIGHT 106

There hasn't been this much activity here since Gorbachov dropped

in. FIVE SWAT OFFICERS check gear, leave the office at

Lorenzo's signal -

I'm sending the SWAT team over for

Barnes now - we don't need the Goddamn

Christmas tourists seeing guns and

flipping out so they'll take him the

long way around...

107 IN BASEMENT - TIGHT ON ALLIGATOR CLIPS 107

We WIDEN as Marvin connects them to one set of bolts, then

another. 'McClave shakes his head. No... no...yes!

Through the annex skywalk to the new

terminal... that way nobody sees them,

we don't have any panic.

And we don't want any disasters.

Barnes has five minutes to check out

that antenna array.

(aside to Marvin)

Christ. They're gonna try something

cute... where's this annex skywalk?

Annex skywalk...? Sounds like the

pissant World's Fair...

He rummages around, finds a big wrinkled MAP, smoothes it out.

Lemme see... yeah, must be this...

connects to the new terminal -

Marvin points to an ELEVATED WALKWAY connecting the two

complexes.

(looking at map)

Shit, it's a fucking bottleneck.

Anybody smart enough to shut down

the airport is smart enough to figure

this... it's a perfect place for an

ambush...

108 INT. TERMINAL ENGINEERING OFFICE - NIGHT 108

Barnes, nervous, throws things into a metal case.

His fellow engineers watch, curious, as he EXITS with the FIVE

SWAT COPS. CAMERA FOLLOWS the four men past -

A) BANKS OF COMPUTERS -

B) COMPUTERIZED WEATHER MAPS -

C) AN L.E.D. DULLES MAP -

all of it useless, all of the operators watching their only hope

Barnes.

A MOUND of CRINKLED PAPERS is FLATTENED against the card table.

We WIDEN, see it is an architect's PLANS of the entire Dulles

netherworld, cribbed by Marvin and now festooned with his various

multi-color jotes and notes.

Now, see? Here's you. And here's

the skywalk.

Now, check this out...

Tunnels.

Like the Japs had all over Iwo Jima.

That's where I got wounded. But we

put those little twerps in their place

once and for all.

(pointing to the map)

These are air ducts for all the

terminals. Heating, cooling. Whole

shebang.

So I put you in the boiler room

where they start, and you come out

there.

Looks like... maybe a mile. Easy

jog.

Uh-uh. It's a pisser of a crawl.

And that's the easy part; firs

you gotta be an acrobat.

110 INT. BASEMENT -- DUCT ACCESS 110

With a cordless drill, Marvin unhinges the access door. Last

bolt, it falls with a sheet-metal SLAM.

McClane WINCES as a BLAST of AIR hits him - and, as. perspiration

breaks out on his forehead, we realize it's hot air.

Whoa.

Winter up there... Summer down here.

He aims Marvin's flashlight down there, isn't enchanted with what

he sees. He turns, takes Marvin's map.

I owe you one, Marvin. How about

a sixpack of malt liquor?

How 'bout a case of Johnny Walker?

(on McClane's look)

Hey, I may be homeless, but I ain't

tasteless.

111 INT. LONG TERMINAL GALLERY - NIGHT 111

A big "history of flight" MURAL high on the wall here HALF

FINISHED, ceilings PARTIALLY OPEN; A WORKER on the scaffold

We're in the annex skywalk. I can

as it's hot for a protocol test.

114 MCCLANE - IN BOILER ROOM - NIGHT 114

McClane moves forward - stops immediately. Looks up at Marvin,

who GRINS.

114A MCCLANE'SPOV DOWNWARD 114A

He's HIGH ABOVE the huge boiler room. The only way across is on

a narrow beam.

114B BACK TO SCENE 114B

McClane takes a breath, starts across the beam. There's a scary

moment at first but he gets quickly confident - a bit too

; 7-7 confident midway - he starts to lose his balance and all-but runs

to the far end, JUMPS to safety.

As he pulls himself up he HEARS Marvin CLAPPING behind him.

With a scowl, McClane checks his map, pushes on.

115 INT. ANNEX CORRIDOR - NIGHT 115

Barnes and the SWAT cops run forward, get on the SLIDEWALK;

impatient, they run even while on it.

116 A WORKER - AT FAR END OF SLIDEWALK 116

reaches into the open slidewalk CONTROL PANEL-hits a SWITCH.

JERKS to a halt -the( six men n it almost TUMBLING. Oblivious,

the worker turns his-bwCk on them again.

Hey! Put that back on!

No reaction. The cop runs forward.

As bullets RAKE the slidewalk and PING off its walls, they JUMP

over the railing & take cover-another COP KILLED on the move.

is CUT badly on the arm by flying GLASS - he CRINGES behind a

dumpster while the three remaining cops EXCHANGE FIRE with the

four soldiers. BULLETS hit near his metal case. He takes a

77 deep breath - rescues it!

in the TUNNELS, he tosses off his sweater into the darkness.

Underneath, his shirt is already sweat-stained.

And then he HEARS the gunfire - it's close! He gets his bearings

-LUNGES through a wall of STEAM -

122 THE ANNEX GALLERY 122

a third airport.cop DIES. His partner KILLS the gunman

(SJ1oi k1E.y) who took out his friend, and then he's KILLED

himself. The last SWAT cop breaks cover and gets CUT DOWN.

Sudden SILENCE.

Suddenly a VENTILATION GRATE by Mulke ' head KICKS OUT, sending

the guy sprawling. McClane JUMP own, FIRING!

Mu ey has caught the damn thing on reflex, and now he TWITCHES

bacTcwards, the bullets SPARKING off the grate before they drill

through him.

McClane ROLLS, FIRES a 'Reilly across the gallery, who takes (X)

COVER. Then BULLETS hit all around McClane; he SEES

124 S ELDON-- ABOVE HIM ON SCAFFOLD 124

125 BACK TO SCENE 125

deliberately SMASHES into the cross bars he passes, one after

another, the SMACK of his body into them sounding like

linebackers in combat -

AIMS - but then the half of the SCAFFOLDING beneath him GIVES

WAY. He FALLS, SCREAMING - LANDS with a CRUNCH beside Barnes-

has a moment of satisfaction - then

Oh, fuck

130 WIDER - SLO MO 130

He RUNS and DIVES SIDEWAYS as the rest of the scaffolding falls

towards him, paint and glue and ha f the mural's tile grid coming

down witWi t !

lands, HARD, the plywood boards from the top of the scaffold

SWEEPING him off his feet - his gun SKITTERS across the linoleum

towards the far end of the slidewalk - he rolls over and SEES

SIX FEET AWAY 132

he, too, has ducked the falling scaffold, but he's already on his

feet, already bending to grab his dropped MAC 10 rom the

He SLAMS into the wall at the end of the walkway HEADFIRST.

There's a sickening CRACK as his neck goes and then he TWITCHES

and slides to the floor, a SMEAR of blood on the slick wall.

136 BACK TO SCENE 136

4 pistol, checks the'bodies to make sure there's no surprises,

You okay?.

The antenna array -

'Both look ,at it - and then

The antenna array outside BLOWS UP, pieces SHATTERING the glass

window. McClane and Barnes DUCK, but they're too far away to be

damanged.

Bait. Something to jerk you off,

make Lorenzo sacrifice his best men,

and make you waste time.

Thornberg, on an inside aisle seat, glances out the window. Sees

something. Releases his seat belt. And goes over to the glass,

pressing' .his nose against it like a kid in a candy store.

LIGHTS in the sky: Other airplanes.

Holly looks at him. She can't help not looking at him; he's

practically in her lap.

I think you're closer than fifty

yards.

So is that plane... practically.

Despite herself, she looks out.

Yeah. There's quite a few out there;

we're in a regular traffic jam.

There's nothing regular about it.

I see you're intrigued. That's my

gift, Mrs. McClane. I make people

curious.

Don't you mean nauseous?

The people have a right to know, Mrs.

McClane. You got in the way of that.

You endangered my children... my

husband.. and me.

And you didn't do it for anything

as noble as "the people". The only

time you see the people is when you're

climbing over their backs.

141 INT. ANNEX - NIGHT 141

McClane is doing a damn decent FIELD DRESSING on Barnes.

(into his cellular phone)

--me? I'll live. But Lorenzo's (X)

SWAT team is dead... and the antenna

array is toast. Start looking for (X)

a new miracle.

AN EERIE ALIEN TYPE VOICE makes them both jump; McClane raises

his GUN.

It's coming from a TRANSCEIVER beside one of the dead men.

Curious, Barnes slides over, picks it up. LISTENS with McClane

to the GARBLED, spine-chilling NOISE.

143 INT. VIRGINIA CHURCH 143

I say again, Annex team... report

in. Annex team, report in.

He looks at Stuart, concerned.

144 INT. ANNEX 144

Some kind of scrambler so even if

we scan their frequency we can't

listen in. Descramble mode must

activate on this code panel.

These guys are pros.

So are you. Break the code -

Next time you kill one of these guys

- get them to enter the code first.

145 IN THE VIRGINIA CHURCH - NIGHT 145

Kahn descends from the choir loft and joins Stuart and Grant.

Sir, we just monitored a call from

their chief engineer. Our people

took out their Swat team...

completely.

You were right... they went for the

antenna array. We're right on

schedule.

Except losing our own team wasn't

part of the plan.

He comes to a decision. Picks up the phone. Speaks. Voice

flat, firm, stern. Around and above him, his men hover over the

improvised screens and terminals.

Attention, Dulles. You were warned

not to try and restore your systems.

146 INT. CAB 146

You've wasted lives and time on a

futile and obvious target. Now you

have to pay the penalty.

147 MCCLANE - IN ANNEX - SAME TIME 147

They HEAR this too, over Barne's cellular tie in to the tower.

McClane grabs it.

There's five dead officers here,

Colonel Stuart - Isn't that penalty

enough?

This interchange is BROADCAST here - Lorenzo SHOUTS into the

McClane! Keep out of this! You-

He stops, seeing the chilling look Trudeau is giving him.

has reacted to both the mention of his name and of McClane's.

His brow furrows. Ah, yes.

McClave? John McClane? The...

policeman hero who saved the Nakatomi

hostages? I read about you in People

magazine. You seemed out of your

league on Nightline, though...

Yeah, Colonel. We were both famous

for five minutes. Saw you get shit

canned by Congress on TV. How much

drug money is Esperanza paying you

to turn traitor?

I think Cardinal Richlieu said it

best: Treason is merely a matter

of dates. And this country has to

learn it can't keep cutting the legs

off men. like General Esperanza -men

with the guts to stand up to Soviet

agression.

And lesson one starts with killing

policemen? What's lesson two - the

Neutron bomb?

I think we can find something in

between.

(aside, off mike)

Give me a flight number - one low

on fuel.

Another man hands him a slip of paper. He reads it, switches to

another mike (or frequency).

Windsor flight one-four-teen, this

is Dulles Approach... do you copy?

150 IN THE REAL TOWER - THE CAB - NIGHT 150

Everyone here REACTS to Stuart's voice - and the chilling lie

he's just told in an affable, good of boy tone that's totally

different than anything we've heard.

Approach, this is one-fourteen.

Where the devil have you been?

We been right here, old man. But

our systems didn't come back on line

until just this second.

What? you over to Tower...now.

That's the runway between here and

the new terminal... he wants to make

all of.us watch it.

CAMERA PUSHES IN on him as he turns and looks out the window.

Don't do it... you bastards, don't

do it..!

Desperate, McClane runs to the spilled paint, grabs turpentine,

rags, pieces of scaffolding.

What are you doing?

Whatever the fuck I can, Barnes...

whatever the fuck I can.

154 IN THE BRITISH COCKPIT 154

Ladies and Gentlemen, as you've

probably noticed, we've started our

descent.

155 INT. CABIN 155

We're sorry about the inconvenience,

but we'll all be on the ground in

a few minutes.

The spent and exhausted people REACT. Some break into APPLAUSE

and CHEERS of "HIP HIP." But one NICE ENGLISH GRANNY -clearly

not an experienced air traveler - still looks TENSE. A

STEWARDESS pauses to pat her shoulder reassuringly.

Just like British rail, luv. May

be.late but we get you there.

156 MCCLANE-FROM OUTSIDE ANNEX 156

Barnes holds one end of.a painter's dropcloth; McClane - now

wearing Barne's coat - DROPS out the broken window to the snow

below.

There he's a tiny SHADOW on the white field. He turns, RUNS

across the. unlit airport... wind whipped SNOW quickly hiding

him from Barnes.

157 THE VIRGINIA CHURCH - NIGHT 157

The crew REACTS as their ILS lights up. High fives all around.

The SOUND of ENGINES.

Oh, God...no...

Can't we cut in, jam them -

Everything's dead.

There's somebody out there -

LIGHT SIZZLES in the distance, dances. Trudeau fumbles up a pair

of binoculars. Looks -

Christ. It's McClane. He'll get

himself killed -

160 MCCLANE - ON THE FIELD 160

He's made two TORCHES from wads of fabric wound on the scaffold

pieces - now he uses his LIGHTER to ignite them. He WAVES the

he SEES its LIGHTS between gusts of snow-

Helpless, listening, watching - the lane's lights intermittently

visible here, too, growing closer - dropping -dropping -

As the plane breaks up and flaming debris SCATTERS.

Behind the plane, watching the fireball roll away from him.

He gives the scream of an. animal in a trap and falls to his

knees.

169 IN THE TOWER 169

Everyone RECOILS at the explosion, which turns this room BLOOD

RED with reflected light. CHUNKS OF METAL and PLASTIC boil

through the sky. Something HITS the GLASS here, starring it and

smearing it with what we hope is only grease.

Somewhere SIRENS wail.

Silence here, too. His men look at him. Except for ThampSm,

who clearly enjoyed his part in the above, their faces are

blank. Maybe they're admiring Stuart's incredible coolness.

Maybe.

That concludes our object lesson for

this evening. If the 747 we

requested is ready on time and General

Esperanza lands unmolested, further

lessons can be avoided.

He DISCONNECTS.

171 THE RUNWAY - LONG DOLLY SHOT - NIGHT 171

Firemen and medics scramble over a chaos of metal and fabric that

used to be an airplane. WATER everywhere;- snow melted for a

hundred yards around from the EXPLOSION.

Pieces of luggage, fragments of people's lives: Toys, purses,

books, a woman's bloody shoe.

McClane weaves through the workers, glazed eyes looking at the

plane.

Tower, this is Rescue Three. No (X)

survivors. Repeat, no surviv-

He stops, looking puzzled at McClane, who is torn, bloody.

McClane.sees the look. Laughs bizzarely.

Relax, pal, I'm not a survivor. I'm

just another victim.

He grabs the rescue worker by the collar.

.the last fucking victim he'll

ever have.

Esperanza's eyes flash for a moment - and then he smiles

paternally, fumbles a cigar out of his breast pocket.

Bueno, joven, bueno! Tu eres un

soldado excelente! Ahora, en vez

del libertad - dame un fosforo?

Flattered, the kid lights him up.

174 INT. VIRGINIA CHURCH - NIGHT 174

In the silence since the crash, no SOUNDS here, except the faint

MONITORING of the Tower and aircraft chatter and the muted AUDIO

of a TV. Garber breaks the silence.

Sir. They've done everything we've

anticpated... so far-

Stuart smiles tightly at the unvoiced question.

Don't worry, Captain. If this goes

into extra innings...

Well, we'll just call an our man in

the other team's locker room.

And - almost in afterthought - he wipes the flight number from

the clear glass board. CAMERA PUSHES to the TELEVISION.

175 ON THE SCREEN 175

SAM COLEMAN is on CAMERA, "live" supered over her face. She's

OUTSIDE on the airfield, her NEWS HELICOPTER beside her. In

the distance behind barricades we see the CRASH SITE.

--hundreds of people in the terminal

heard or saw the crash, but still

there has been no official word from

authorities. Meanwhile - despite

the fact that only one runway has

been closed due to the tragedy,

several dozen airliners are visible

from where I stand, endlessly circling

the field. Rumors abound that somehow

the accident has interfered with

normal landing procedures here.

(i12 ) 175 CONTINUED - 175

Other reports say there were

difficulties in the tower before the

crash, and that they may have even

contributed to it. One thing is

certain: With weather conditions

worsening, the problem here and in

the sky above us will continue to

grow. This is Samantha Coleman at (X)

Dulles International Airport.

176 INT. AIRPORT POLICE OFFICE - NIGHT 176

PHONES ringing off the. wall; pitiful attempts at damage control.

A DOCTOR gives Barnes a proper bandage on his cut.

McClane sits dazed on a bench, eyes looking at nothing - the

coffee someone gave him ignored. Trudeau.appears.

Barnes. We have to warn those planes

we got a lunatic down here who likes

to pretend he's the tower. Get up

to the cab and get us on the air.

On the air? With what?

With your Goddamn brain!

Barnes leaves. McClane blinks, coming around to reality. Sees

Trudeau.

Trudeau... I... I...

You don't have to say anything,

McClane. We all know how you feel.

Do you? Do you? I've been a cop

13 years... Everything from... lost

kids to hostages... but... all of

it was... taking care of business...

taking care of peoplle... until

tonight. Tonight, everything I did,

everything I tried...

I never felt so useless.

(feeling his pain)

Our own SWAT team's gone. We called

the Government for help. They're

sending in a special Army unit.

Tactical Terrorist Team...

McClane sees something else there in his eyes.

And...?

Your wife's plane...?

They keep broadcasting, even though

we can't answer. They... they'll

run out of fuel in 90 minutes.

on?

Are you crazy? I wouldn't let those

Puzzled, the man pulls his bag from under the seat, gets one out.

Can you tune in the cockpit frequency?

I want to hear what's going on.

He TUNES the mike's receiver, monitoring. with an earplug.

FROWNS.

Nothing.

You just said it would work -

It is working. But all I get is...

The weather recording. It's like...

like the tower isn't there.

changes.

earlier; Lorenzo, worried about his status - and McClane, plain

worried.

As the ROTORS keep TURNING, SOLDIERS and the CHOPPER CREWS

hustle out of the choppers, the wind blowing over them and their

Hey, officer. Thought you'd be

I know that feeling. Interested in

a nice coat?

The lining's ripped and it needs

some invisible mending. Keep it.

Think you can get me on line upstairs

Marvin chuckles, moves over to a table and pulls aside a cloth.

All electronic stuff there.

I was just a kid, working those

up. Still read Popular Mechanics.

out the rear door.

206 INT. CAB 206

REACTIONS as the PREVIOUS lit runway GOES DARK and a DIFFERENT

ONE LIGHTS UP.

206 INT. ESPERANZA'S PLANE - NIGHT 206

Wincing against the blowing snow and wind, the General expertly

trims his descent. He reaches for a co-pilot's control and

sweeps the dead man to the floor, bites down on his cigar. The

plane begins to VIBRATE, but he humms to himself.

He's the scum of the earth. But one hell of a pilot.

207 INT. ACCESS TUNNEL 207

McClane, breathless, reaches the ladder. The grid above him is

5 seconds ETA.

McClane checks his pistol clip with a snap.

Come to poppa, you son-of-a-bitch-

He flies up the ladder - and BRUISES his shoulder against the

locked grid.

Shit!

209 STUART AND SOLDIERS - IN JEEP ON AIRFIELD 209

Their BREATH clouding inside the still cold JEEP as it BOUNCES

along. Garber shines a FLASHLIGHT into the falling snow,

illuminates a snow-covered runway number sign: "EIGHT WEST."

The miltary plane ROARS overhead!

BLAM! BLAM! McClane shoots off the lock apparatus of the grid!

A RICOCHET PINGS off one of the grids hydraulic hinges and

McClane winces as metal splinters sail by. Then he begins to

muscle the heavy grid upwards.

A FIELD of SNOW and ICE. But now a BLACK RECTANGLE EMERGES from

it - it's the TUNNEL GRID, SNOW falling through it - the damn

thing must weight over 300 pounds - McClane gets his head and

shoulders up and out. Looks at -

212 THE PLANE - HALF A MILE AWAY 212

about to hit the runway -

213 BACK TO SCENE 213

McClane pushes upwards - grunts - when he shifts his grip his

SKIN RIPS on the cold metal - with a grimace, he pushes his

rifle out, starts to follow -

the damaged hydraulic hinge suddenly SNAPS with a squish of thick

fluid.

the 300 pound grid THUDS down on McClane's back. He GROANS,

stunned.

SCREECHES down on the runway!

217 THE SCENE - BLAZING FAST INTERCUTS 217

A) MCCLANE - dazed, trapped, he looks up and SEES -

B) THE PLANE - 1/4 mile away, coming right towards him-

C) MCCLANE - struggling - still PINNED to the

runway like a bug in the Natural History Museum.

Now we HEAR the ROAR of the. jet's ENGINES -

D) THE PLANE - 1/8 mile away -

E) MCCLANE'S FEET - still in the tunnel, they GROPE

for leverage on the steps -and SLIP! Now they kick

away at AIR -

218 MCCLANE AND PLANE - IN ONE SHOT 218

It's.coming, coming, COMING. Desperate, McClane sees that part

of the rifle is half under the grid. Now, he puts all his energy

into levering the rifle against the steel.

Slowly, slowly, sweat breaking out on his forehead, he levers the

rifle higher and higher, the rifle in turn levering the grid

upward, an inch at a time finally, it's high enough for him to

JAM the rifle's bayonet ring into the grid while the cheek notch

of the stock perches precariously on the lip of the hole.

AND THE PLANE IS RIGHT FUCKING THERE.

McClane DIVES OUT OF THE HOLE.

McClane rolls away from the wheels, which miss him by inches.

The PLANE SMACKS into the half-open grid, which goes FLYING, the

plane hardly dented, the rifle SNAPPING like a toothpick, the

scrambler CRUNCHING like a bug

McClave kisses asphalt, WINCES at the SCORCH of jet exhaust five

feet over his head.

Skids roughly to a stop a hundred yards away.

McCl:ane:gets to his feet, sucks in air - and heads for the plane.

221 STUART AND SOLDIERS - SAME TIME 221

Close enough to SEE the plane as it STOPS -

There -!

Freedom.

Not yet.

McClane's FIST smacks in, knocking Esperanza back from the door.

McClane comes up the steps, gun leveled at the startled fugitive.

Thought you'd pull this off, didn't

you? I guess you didn't count on

me being here. Actually, I didn't

count on me being here.

W-who are you?

Just a cop who's spent half his career

busting scumbag lowlife dope dealers.

Looks like it's business as usual.

Think this will look good on my

record?

Suddenly BULLETS PING on the hatch inches from McClane's head.

No.

NcClane 'DIVES and rolls into the cabin - FIRES TWICE out the door

and then almost on instinct whirls -

Esperanza's snatched up the rifle from the dead corporal but (X)

McClane's SHOT hits him in the SHOULDER. With a HOWL, Esperanza

falls backwards but hangs on to the gun.

GARBER and another man are there, rifles UP -

BACK TO SCENE

McClane FIRES, blowing a hole in h m so ' THROAT, and as (X)

Garber's slugs come closer, McClane IVES into the cockpit,

BULLETS smacking all around him from Garber and Esperanza -

THE COCKPIT 225 -

McClane SLAMS the door behind him, LOCKS IT. BULLETS PING into

the door, which INDENTS from the hits which don't penetrate it.

226 OUTSIDE THE PLANE 226

GARBER helps Esperanza down the steps. Stuart runs to him.

General!

(indicating the wound)

I'm all right - he said he was a

,policeman...

A policeman -

PUSH to Stuart. He knows which policeman...

He went in the cockpit -

He's going to hell.

Silence. McClane REACTS to the.two dead men sharing the tiny

space with him... the SNOW and GLASS everywhere... and then he

crawls to the door, gingerly tries it.

IT WON'T MOVE. He tries harder.

228 OTHER SIDE OF DOOR 228

230 EXT. FRONT OF PLANE - NIGHT 230

Stuart, Esperanza and two of the others ring the nose of the

plane, weapons out.

Garber - the last man - comes up, delayed by locking McClane in

the cabin.

231 INSIDE THE COCKPIT 231

McClane DUCKS as FIVE MACHINE GUNS BEGIN TO RIP THE PLACE APART.

What's left of the glass IMPLODES, and ricochets begin SLAMMING

around the room - McClane eats floor, but the snaking lines of

bullets criss cross the cockpit, searching him out -

HOLY MOTHER OF GOD -

Glass rakes his forehead, blood misting his vision - He crawls

N to the door - throws his weight against it - nothing -

Having decimated the front of the plane, Stuart signals and now

they flank the sides. What's left of the window glass reflects

their FIRE like a Fourth of July show - Esperanza alone SMILES as

he shoots -

he's HIT in the left hand.

235 IN THE COCKPIT 235

Clunk-clunk-clunkCLUNK. TEN GRENADES land and BOUNCE here like

hailstones from hell. They SIZZLE. McClane rolls over and

suddenly SEES -

CAMERA PUSHES to it: "EJECT."

in one move vaults into the seat, snaps on the belt, grabs the

steel vanguard above McClane's head PUNCHING THROUGH what's left

of the canopy.

the cockpit EXPLODES! It's all so FAST and EYE SEARING we're not

sure if McClane is clear - but then we SEE

240 MCCLANE - IN MID AIR 240

No sound, now, just the WHOOSH of the air going past - the

ejection seat is TUMBLING -

WHOMP! The 'chute OPENS with violent YANK.

Christ!

He DROPS from frame.

241 THE BURNING PLANE 241

At the jeep, Stuart and his men REACT as WATER from MELTING SNOW (X)

runs past their feet. Garber POINTS to the ghostly image of

the 'chute, half a mile away -

But Stuart turns at the SOUND of SIRENS.

The calvary is coming... and it's not his.

243 BACK TO SCENE 243

Fall back to the Church! Now! (X)

Helping the wounded Esperanza, they vanish into the darkness.

THE PARACHUTE - ON THE GROUND 244

He staggers out from under the yards of silk, COVERED IN SNOW

But now that stewardess reaches up and turns on the TV PROJECTOR.

As the lights DARKEN, Thornberg decides this is perfect cover.

pretending he's getting a blanket overhead, he slips his credit

card in one of airphones. Then he moves down the aisle, phone

I inside his jacket.

Sir, please - we may be landing at

any moment -the seat belt light is-

I- I'm going to be sick -

He makes a croaking noise to sell it, stumbles into the lavatory.

This is Richard Thornberg. Put me

through to the News Director.

I know he's getting ready for the

Now get him or start typing your

249 INT. AIR POLICE OFFICE 249

The DOCTOR patches McClane's right hand; one of the soldiers

gives McClane a cigarette.

Esperanza's down... but he's hurt.

I killed one more man... that's six (X)

they've lost all together.

Maybe if we knew how many they had

to start with, we could get excited.

But if they got fifty guys, it's a

little early to break out the (X)

champagne.

McClane, we don't need a loose cannon

on this deck. What if they decide

to crash another plane in retaliation

for your little stunt?

r,1

Last I heard, they can't do that

again. And if I grabbed Esperanza,

the situation would be over.

Maybe they're more creative than you

think! McClane, we're here to jerk

off that cocksucker until he tries

to take off - period! This time

you're the wrong guy in the wrong

place at the wrong time!

McClane stands, glares at the two officers. He flips away the

cigarette, walks away, pissed.

.The story of my life.

But the enlisted men seem sympathetic. And so does

Who now pulls McClane aside.

McClane. You said they showed up

there right away?

Stuart's guys? Yeah. That means

they're on the field or close -

I think I know where.

Interested, McClane'follows Barnes around the corner.

251 WHEN THEY'RE ALONE 251

Barnes unfolds some.plot plans.

These are the old plans when the

longer runways went in... that's

twelve years ago. And it looks like

they did some modifications on site...

moved Tracon, phone, ILS - all the

underground stuff -so they could

handle drainage. If I'm right, all

of it would run along the edge of

the airport property - and go right

past this neighborhood.

i12. - 251 CONTINUED - 251

So - if they know this too - they

could be sitting around the fireplace

and hanging their fucking stockings

in one of these houses?

Maybe. Yeah. Well, seventy eighty

per cent, five percent either way-

Are you sure or not?

I was sure about tying into the

antenna array. And... and I got

five officers killed.

You didn't do that - you did your

I had a choice and I made it. But

those cops didn't have a choice, and

neither do those soldiers now. I'm

an engineer, McClane. It's supposed

to a wires and circuits... iron

and steel. Not flesh and blood.

Not lives. If...if I'm wrong again...

I don't want anyone else to get

orders that could get them killed.

(after a moment)

Then how would you feel about a

volunteer?

252 INT. HOLLY'S PLANE - NIGHT 252

The passengers' patience has begun to frazzle. The Older Woman

for this mess, that's for sure.

It's hard to blame anyone for the

Yeah? What about that porker Willard

Scott?

I shoulda taken the bus. At least

they can pull over for food and gas.

I REACTS to what the woman's said. As the Stewardess PASSES, Holly

signals her - RISES halfway to meet her.

STEWARDESS.

Yes?

I... was just wondering. Our flight

was only supposed to.be 5 1/2 hours- (X)

Do we have enough fuel for all this

endless circling?

Pause. The Stewardess" face eases into an official smile.

Oh, of course we do. They anticipate

little proems like this.

She moves away. We TIGHTEN on Holly. She's chilled by the lie.

Worried, she TURNS... looks at the AirPhone. X)

254 TIGHT ON MCCLANE'S WAIST 254

HIS BEEPER SHOWS as he CLIMBS something - we WIDEN.

He and Barnes are outside a HOUSE that backs up to the Airport.

Both peer over the fence. It's a modest DC suburban tract job.

People TRIM a TREE. It could be Norman Rockwell.

Hell. These people are hanging their

Goddamn stockings.

They DROP down into the snow, CRUNCH to the next fence. Look

No tree: People having dinner, a MENORAH burning on the

windowsill.

r.i12 55A NEW ANGLE 255A

They've come to a corner; now they go back to the street, spread

Barne's map out on the hood of Barne's still humming CAR. Far

behind them, we SEE the illuminated airport TOWER, centered in

the dark blot that should be brightly active runways.

Barnes reaches inside his jacket, fumbles in his jammed plastic

pocket thingie for a little flashlight. He checks the map.

Four more possibles. Three houses...

and a church.

They cross the intersection on foot, walk over a lawn. It's

further to the next place; more prosperous yard. Suddenly

McClane puts up his hand -Barnes stops - both look at -

257 NEXT PROPERTY - THE CHURCH 257

Baker is walking, almost casually, around the rear of the house.

258 BACK TO SCENE 258

McClane and Barnes huddle, whisper.

Could be a sentry -

And he could just be out for a walk-

Then why is he going over his own

footprints?

259 THEIR POV - CLOSER 259

Indeed, gar's steady progress has made a trench around the

church property, and the distinctive PRINT of his galoshes now

makes double images.

260 BACK TO SCENE 260

Stay here. Get ready to call the

marines.

I thought they were Army.

Who the fuck cares, just be ready.

Saying this, McClane takes his own gun from his holster and puts

it in the back of his trousers... then moves off.

Barnes takes out a cellular phone, lurks under a tree.

This is Chief Lorenzo. I want every

officer recalled now and assembled

There, all the PORTABLE TV's ON DISPLAY are BROADCASTING the SAME

THING. A CUSTOMER hearing this DROPS a CRYSTAL VASE.

(as tape ENDS)

Since then this reporter has learned

that the terrorists have virtual

control of the entire airport - a

fact the authorities have suppressed.

The terrorists promise more bloodshed

unless their demands are met; and

now that special Army Commandoes have

arrived at the airport, the liklihood

of a full scale and deadly battle

is dangerously close -

McClane is in Lorenzo's police car; a DOZEN other police cars

full of officers behind, lights SPINNING. Lorenzo leans out the

window like Ward Bond on Wagon Train.

Converge on Hanger 11 on all four

sides! When the city blues get here

with their backup, they can pick up

the pieces! MOVE OUT!

My God...

Then something else sinks in; she looks at the empty airphone

she STOPS - takes her seatmate's PURSE. Then, she sidesteps

some panicked people, goes to the kitchen area.

And finds one of the special keys for the lavatories.

332 THORNBERG - IN LAVATORY 332

And so it continues: A standoff

between terrorists and authorities

with the lives of thousands at stake.

But at least this time, in this place,

the truth, at least, is not among

the hostages because Richard (X)

Thornberc put his life and his talent (X)

on the line for humanity and country. (X)
