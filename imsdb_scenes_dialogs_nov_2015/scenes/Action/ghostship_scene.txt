INT. BARGE - DAY

Crewman EPPS (29), wearing a life vest and tool belt, jumps

down into the darkness. She stands in a great hollow cavern,

oily, wet, resonant with the sound of creaking, rusty steel

and WATER MOVING OVER ITS HULL on the other side.

INT. BARGE - LATER - DAY

Epps comes to a low point in the darkness, shining her light

on a lake of salt water sloshing against the bulkhead. She

kneels. As the water sloshes back she sees that it is leaking

in through the seams in the steel plate of the hull.

EXT. BARGE - LATER - DAY

Epps pulls herself onto the deck from below. She stands on a

rusting 5000 ton tank barge being pulled in the open ocean

by a brawny marine tug at the end of a 150 foot tow cable.

It is a typical summer day in the southern Bering Sea, which

means a healthy chop and a stiff cold breeze out of the north-

west.  She closes the hatch behind her and makes her way

forward.

EXT. BARGE - BOW - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

Up ahead, the tug pulls steadily, grey-black clouds of diesel

smoke rising from its massive turbine vents.

Epps cinches and checks her body harness, focused and

professional. The product of a rocky childhood in the Pacific

Northwest and a few years of hard living, she's found her

true calling now. And under some grime, several polypro shirts

and a pair of orange men's Insulite pants she might even be

considered pretty.

She clips her harness into the tow cable where it attaches

to a heavy pair of eye cleats at the bow. She climbs onto

the cable, hanging out over the water as it breaks on the

bow beneath her. She pulls herself forward on a roller bearing

that fits over the width of the cable and starts off toward

the tug at the other end.

EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - LATER - DAY

DODGE and GREER look on from the stern, where the boat's

name "Arctic Warrior" is emblazoned on the transom. Dodge

(37), scruffy chief engineer, wearing de rigueur greasy

coveralls and nicotine stained fingers, is an expatriate

Texan and former merchant marine. GREER (42), is the boat's

first mate, African American, originally from some sweltering

red-neck hellhole, now a tug pilot intentionally well to the

north.

They watch as Epps pulls herself toward them, the cable

occasionally dipping a few feet with a spray of water as a

passing swell slackens it. Epps pulls herself to the stern

where the cable winds into a tow anchor.

She unclips and drops to the deck.

INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

The view from the pilothouse commands 360 degrees as radar

and GPS navigation displays glow. MURPHY, the ship's master,

pilots the boat. He is 48, at sea all his adult life, and

most of the rest, a fact written on his face and one that

every crewman who's ever worked for him has been willing to

bet his life on. A walkie-talkie CRACKLES AWAKE.

Murphy turns back to see Greer, Epps, and Dodge looking up

at him from the stern.

EXT. OPEN OCEAN - DAY

HIGH AND WIDE as the Arctic Warrior pulls the barge against

the swell of a grey ocean and a darkening sky.

EXT. PORT GERMAINE - ST. LAWRENCE ISLAND - DAY

The shores of St. Lawrence Island open into a small port

town of mainly pre-fab buildings as the Arctic Warrior

approaches with the barge, now pathetically listing to one

side as it moves into the harbor.

EXT. PORT GERMAINE - DOCKS - LATER - DAY

A smaller harbor tug helps the Arctic Warrior jockey the

listing barge to the dock as Epps and Dodge jump off to tie

her up.

INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

Greer feathers the tug into position and shuts down the

turbines.

EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - DAY

Murphy jumps down from the pilothouse to the deck as a fat

Russian man, Vasili (60) and a MECHANIC in grease-covered

orange coveralls approach from the dock.

INT. VASILI'S OFFICE - DAY

In a prefab office with a view of the shipyard, Vasili cuts

a check as Murphy and Greer look on. He tears it out of the

book, handing it across the desk to Murphy, who inspects it.

Vasili pushes a transfer register toward him. Murphy signs.

EXT. SHIPYARD - DAY

Greer and Murphy walk back toward the dock.

INT. BAR - NIGHT

A typical port town bar. Except this one is on an island in

the middle of the Bering Sea. Epps lines up a shot at the

pool table as a couple of SEAMEN check out her ass and a

tattoo of Wiley Coyote poking out of her pants. Greer reads

a paper near-by.

Murphy enters, crossing to the bar where Dodge nurses a beer

and a cigarette. Murphy throws down an envelope with Dodge's

name on it. Dodge picks it up, thumbs through a thick stack

of hundreds.

INT. BAR - LATER - NIGHT

The place is a little more crowded now as Epps pushes her

way through to the bar, a cigarette dangling from her mouth.

She buys two beers and pays the BARTENDER from her envelope

of cash. She takes the beers back to the far wall where a

young off-duty COASTGUARDSMAN stands. He takes one, they

laugh.

AT A TABLE

Beers, cigarettes and pay envelopes on the table before them,

Dodge, Greer and Murphy look on at Epps across the room, who

is showing the coastguardsman a birthmark on her neck.

Greer and Murphy trade looks as Dodge raises his beer.

A MINOR COMMOTION can be heard as they sit there.

They look over to see the coastguardsman's GIRLFRIEND, late

20s, hefty in a red miniskirt and big hair.

WITH EPPS

Epps coolly puts out her cigarette as a circle has gathered

around her and the girlfriend, anxious to see a girl fight.

Murphy turns to see a shipyard RIVETER, a big man holding a

beer, still wearing his welding leathers. Murphy turns back

to Epps and the Girlfriend.

Epps starts forward but the Riveter stands in her way, taking

Murphy by the collar.

Or WHACK! Murphy can't help but wince as a pool cue breaks

in two over the Riveter's head.

Dodge, cigarette in his mouth, takes a look at the cue half

he still holds, shaking his head.

The Riveter's hands fall from Murphy's collar and his legs

buckle. Some of his BUDDIES hold him up as Greer reminds

some of the others he's holding a pool cue of his own.

He looks to Epps like let's get the hell out of here. She

grabs her coat.

Epps holds there as the Coastguardsman steps up to his

girlfriend.

He gives her the ring from his finger. Murphy rolls his eyes

as the others look on.

Darlene breaks into tears as they all look on, some pat her

on the back.

The Coastguardsman takes her by the hand. Epps looks to Murphy

and the others as he leads her out.

EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY

Murphy, Greer, and Dodge ready the tug to leave as Epps

approaches on the dock. She jumps down onto the deck, a spring

in her step and a song in her heart.

INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - DAY

Murphy throttles up the turbines and backs the tug away from

the dock as Greer studies the dawn sky.

EXT. PORT GERMAINE - DOCKS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

As the tug turns into the harbor channel, the sun rising

under a cloud bank of brilliant red and orange.

INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

Dodge and Epps play cards at the galley table.

He puts down his hand. Epps takes another drag from her

cigarette, collecting her winnings.

She gathers the cards, shuffles.

She deals the cards in silence.

She looks on at him as he holds there, takes his cards.

Dodge takes a drag from his cigarette, thinking about it.

She wants to laugh, but only studies her cards.

She takes a hit from her cigarette as she plays her hand.

EXT. OPEN OCEAN - BERING SEA - NIGHT

THE SONG "SOS" BY ABBA BLASTS as the tug plows westward

through a steady chop and a mild swell.

INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - NIGHT

The MUSIC COMES FROM HERE. Greer has the CD player cranked

as he mans the helm in the glow of the pilothouse. He checks

the radar, holds there a beat. He turns the MUSIC DOWN and

picks up a walkie-talkie.

Greer studies the radar display as he waits.

INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - MASTER'S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

Murphy sits at his desk over the ship's log, holding his

radio.

INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - LATER - NIGHT

CLOSE ON RADAR DISPLAY as the sweep-refresh reveals a bright

point of light in the middle of nowhere.

Murphy holds the radio mic as Greer looks on, Epps and Dodge

standing back.

Only the quiet hiss of white noise comes back from the radio

speaker as the bright point flashes on the radar screen.

Again, only white noise comes back as the point flashes on

the screen.

A beat as Murphy holds there. He raises the radio mic.

Again, only the quiet hiss of static comes back.

EXT. OPEN OCEAN - NIGHT

The Arctic Warrior cuts a foamy break in the ink black water.

INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - NIGHT

CLOSE ON RADAR DISPLAY as the phantom point flashes closer.

Murphy looks on as Greer pilots, Dodge and Epps watching.

Greer throttles back and the boat slows.

EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

The halogen flood lights flare to life, brilliantly

illuminating the water in front of the boat.

INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

The four of them look intently into the darkness beyond the

light. Murphy reaches for the spot control, sweeping a broad

beam of light with a joy stick.

EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

As the tug moves along, servo motors sweep the searchlight

over the bow of the boat and into the darkness.

INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

They peer into the night beyond the boat as it slowly moves,

when a shadow looms into view.

Greer throttles down all the way and they drift, as the shadow

looms bigger before them in the light from the boat.

As they approach, the shadow appears to be a giant rusting

bow, rising up from the water, disappearing in the darkness

above them. Murphy sweeps the searchlight to reveal more of

what appears to be a large, darkened ship. As they come

around, the name "CHIMERA" can be seen above the anchor

alleys.

Murphy reaches for the mic, hits the LOUD HAILER.

EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

The tug is dwarfed by the massive rusting hulk of the Chimera

rising above it.

The quiet rumble of the tug's turbines is the only sound.

INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

Murphy raises the mic again.

They wait, looking on at the silent, darkened ship under the

glare of their lights.

EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - LATER - NIGHT

Epps and Murphy, in heavy parkas, climb a hydraulic deck

crane up to the Chimera as Dodge man's the controls against

the movement of the water.

INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

Greer holds the tug steady as Epps and Murphy can be seen

making their way up under the floodlights.

EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

Murphy pulls himself up and jumps down onto the deck. Epps

jumps down behind him. Murphy throws his light up on the

superstructure. All remnants of paint have been rusted over,

lending a still darker ominousness to it.

EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

Murphy and Epps move cautiously along, shining their lights

as they go. Despite the omnipresent corrosion, everything

seems to be in order. The decks are clear and there is no

apparent damage. They come to a hatchway. Epps shines her

light down the darkened passage. Murphy moves in.

INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

Murphy and Epps move down the passageway. Even the walls in

here are rusted. They come to a flight of stairs.

INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

Greer and Dodge wait. Greer reaches for his radio.

After a moment, Murphy comes back on the radio.

INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

Murphy and Epps climb the darkened stairway.

They top the stairs and walk into a wider passageway which

takes them into an open area. Their lights shine around them,

revealing sinks and counters and racks of old kitchen

equipment, a few pots still hanging.

They move through the galley and into another, narrower,

passageway.

INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

Greer and Dodge look on.

Greer and Dodge look at each other.

Dodge and Greer hold there, waiting. Only silence from the

other end.

No answer.

No answer.

Another beat in silence.

INT. CHIMERA - BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

Murphy and Epps stand at the top of a stairway, looking over

an immense ballroom. Murphy raises his radio.

Though it is dark, there is enough light to see its ornate

opulence, tables and chairs in place near a large dance floor

and orchestra well, and a magnificent crystal chandelier

hanging over it all.

EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - FOREDECK - NIGHT

Epps and Murphy climb down the deck crane as Greer and Dodge

meet them at the bottom.

INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

Dodge, Epps, Greer and Murphy sit around the galley table.

A long beat as they hold there.

They hold there looking on at him, waiting.

A beat. Dodge looks to Epps and Greer.

EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY

The tug is tied up alongside the Chimera, whose dark hull

stretches off for seven hundred more feet in the light of

day.

INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - DAY

Murphy brings up the radio mic as Greer and the others look

on.

After a moment, a distance-warped, coolly professional, female

voice comes back.

Murphy looks to the others, almost smiling.

EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - STERN WINCH - DAY

Dodge, Epps, Murphy and Greer are standing on the stern of

the boat under the power winch.

He indicates the bow of the Chimera.

EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY

Murphy has backed the tug up to the bow of the Chimera. Greer

operates the deck crane, one of Dodge's mammoth cables

dangling from it down to the winch on the stern.

WITH EPPS

Epps hangs on to the top of the crane as it comes to the

starboard anchor alley in the bow of the Chimera. Dodge pokes

his face out from the other side.

Dodge disappears from the hole and his hand comes back with

a smaller pilot cable, which Epps takes and threads through

the loop at the end of the tow cable. She places the end of

the pilot cable in a vice collar and uses a wrench to tighten

it down, with the effect of joining the two cables.

Dodge disappears, pulling up the slack from the pilot cable

through the anchor alleys.

Epps reaches over and unhinges the crane hook and the tow

cable explosively drops, banging loudly against the Chimera's

hull with a shower of black rust.

EXT. CHIMERA - WITH DODGE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

Dodge cranks a portable pulley winch on the deck, the pilot

cable slowly pulling the tow cable up through the anchor

alley.

It is heavy and the winch shows the strain as Dodge cranks

it. He continues, when something gives in the winch mechanism

and the whole thing slides forward on the pilot cable,

entangling Dodge's leg and dragging him on his ass along the

deck.

EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

The tow cable creates a spray of rust and smoke as it spills

out of the anchor alley before Epps.

EXT. CHIMERA - WITH DODGE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

Dodge slides toward the anchor alley like a piece of meat

toward a sausage grinder, when the winch slams into it and

stops dead, the cable continuing on with a loud shriek

dangerously close to his face, until...

EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

The last of the cable explosively whips out of the anchor

alley in front of Epps and splashes in the water below. A

beat as she holds there.

EXT. CHIMERA - WITH DODGE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

Dodge lies tangled in the winch.

EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY

Two tow cables extend from the Chimera's anchor alleys down

into the water and come up again from the water to the tow

anchor on the tug's stern.

Dodge looks on as Greer and Epps stand by. He raises his

walkie.

INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

Murphy slowly throttles up, moving the boat forward. He turns

to see as the Chimera drops back behind them.

EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - DAY

The tug moves slowly away from the Chimera as Epps, Greer

and Dodge look on.

WIDE ON TUG AND CHIMERA

As the tug widens the distance, leaving the Chimera in place.

INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

Murphy holds the helm steady as the Chimera recedes.

EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - DAY

Dodge, Epps and Greer look on as the tow cables begin to

rise in their wake.

The tug slows as the cables rise slowly from the water.

The tug slows still more.

It slows still more, until the tug just creeps along, and

the massive tow cables rise entirely out of the water,

straightening as the slack is pulled out.

EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

Some fifty yards behind the tug, the tow cables come taught

in the anchor alleys of the Chimera.

INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

Murphy holds the throttle.

Murphy eases forward on the throttle and the turbines rise

in pitch.

EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

As the tow cables stretch and the bow of the Chimera inches

forward.

EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - DAY

The turbines grow louder as Greer, Epps, and Dodge look on

at the Chimera behind them, the massive tow cables bowing

under their own weight.

INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

Murphy eases forward on the throttle, picking up speed.

EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

The giant ship CREAKS AND MOANS as it starts forward, a small

bow break forming on its hull.

EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - DAY

The tug is kicking up a foaming wake as it pulls the Chimera

along behind it. Dodge lets out a hoot, exchanging high fives

with Epps and Greer.

INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

Murphy smiles as he looks back at the Chimera following

behind.

INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - DAY

CLOSE ON A CHART. The south Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska.

A pencil traces a route.

Greer looks on from the helm as Murphy, Dodge and Epps stand

over the map table.

An EXPLOSIVE THUD shudders the boat. They look to each other.

EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

Dodge jumps down from the pilothouse as another LOUD THUMP

BLOWS OUT OF THE TURBINE VENTS, SHOWERING OIL OVER THE DECK.

INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

Greer shoves the throttle back.

EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - DAY

The boat goes dead in the water, thick black smoke billowing

from the turbine vents.

EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

as the bow slows in the water, the tow cables coming slack.

INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY

Dodge pulls open the door. The place is thick with smoke as

he makes his way to the turbine gauges, Epps and Murphy

behind. Dodge opens the number one turbine cover, looks

inside.

Dodge looks over the smoking turbine, pulls back an aluminum

intake blade, hot to the touch.

EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - DAY

Greer, Dodge, Epps, and Murphy confer on the deck.

EXT. CHIMERA - DAY

The Arctic Warrior floats tied to the side of the Chimera.

INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - DAY

Dodge has both turbines opened up as he works.

INT. CHIMERA - MEZZANINE DECK - DAY

Lights shine on what was once an elegant interior promenade.

Murphy and Greer stand looking on at it.

AT THE PURSERS DESK

Epps looks through a file cabinet behind a heavy wood counter

as Greer and Murphy approach.

Greer picks one up.

Murphy takes it, looking it over.

INT. CHIMERA - "B" DECK - DAY

Murphy, Epps, and Greer top a staircase out onto a long,

darkened corridor. They move down. Some of the doors are

open, faint light from port holes showing small cabins with

beds, desks, a few chairs.

INT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - FORWARD PASSAGE - DAY

Murphy, Epps, and Greer come to a hatchway marked "BRIDGE."

INT. CHIMERA - BRIDGE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

The forward windows show the expanse of the ocean before

them and the rusting foredeck about 150 feet below. Light

from the windows illuminates the bridge as Murphy, Greer and

Epps look around. Despite a little corrosion and a layer of

dirt, everything seems in its place.

Epps steps up to the wall, where several framed photos hang.

The uniformed man in the photo is a gaunt, stern-looking man

from another century, with dark, hollow eyes.

EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - NIGHT

A dimming purple horizon is giving way to night as the tug

floats under the bow of the Chimera.

EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - NIGHT

Dodge works up to his elbows in turbine 1 as Greer monitors

a pressure gauge.

INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - NIGHT

Through the pilothouse windows, the hull of the Chimera

disappears into the darkness beyond the tug's work lights.

Murphy sits at the chart table as Epps steps in.

She brings him his cup, seeing the documents he brought back

from the Chimera.

Murphy nods, considering it.

Epps takes a sip of her coffee as she thinks about it.

Murphy looks out at the Chimera off the bow.

Epps nods, takes another sip of coffee, looking on at the

rusting hull of the Chimera stretching off in the light.

EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - DAY

Greer operates the crane arm as Dodge directs him. The crane

hoists out one of the massive turbine fans onto the deck.

Dodge gives him the thumbs up as it comes down easily.

A beat as Murphy stands there, knowing he's right.

A beat.

INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

Murphy enters the pilothouse as the distance-warped VOICE

comes back on the radio.

Murphy raises the radio mic as Epps, Dodge, and Greer step

in.

After a moment, the same professional, distance-warped voice

comes back.

A beat as Murphy holds there.

Another beat as Murphy holds there, as the others look on.

A long beat as the static of the open channel comes back.

A beat as they hold there, thinking about it.

A beat as Dodge looks back, then out at the Chimera.

INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - MASTER'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

A pencil point on a map follows across Saudi Arabia, coming

to the Persian Gulf and tracing the coast of the Arab Emirates

to Dubayy.

Murphy sits at his desk over the map. His pencil point follows

the Persian Gulf from Dubayy, through the straight of Hormuz

into the Gulf of Oman. Murphy marks an "X" there. A beat as

he looks on at it.

He opens a large envelope he found aboard the Chimera. He

empties it on the desk. He looks through it, docking receipts

from various ports of call, bills of lading, etc. He looks

over the passenger manifest.

INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - MASTERS QUARTERS - DAY

Murphy wakes. He lies on his bunk, having fallen asleep last

night in his clothes, still holding the envelope and some of

the papers inside.

INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

Dodge disassembles the turbine fans on deck as Greer reads

in the shade of the deck house. Dodge's hand slips and he

skins his knuckles.

Murphy has stepped out into the sunlight.

Murphy nods. A beat.

INT. CHIMERA - PUBLIC ROOM - DAY

Epps steps from a passageway into a large public room. Tables

and chairs are scattered haphazardly, light falling in from

windows along the wall where tattered curtains hang. She

walks on.

A pair of empty glasses sit on a table, an empty sherry

decanter beside them. An ashtray sits beside that. Epps stops,

reaching down. She pulls back a half-smoked cigarette,

lipstick smudging the end, yellowing and fragile from time.

And, as she stands there, we see a FIGURE, IN MURKY

SILHOUETTE, MOVE PAST THE DOORWAY IN THE BACKGROUND. In an

instant it is there and gone.

She puts down the cigarette, having sensed a presence. She

turns to the doorway across the room, but there is nothing

to be seen now.

INT. CHIMERA - PUBLIC ROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

A doll's white face, eyes haunting and coldly blue, stares

into the middle distance. It lies on a love seat as Epps

steps up. She lifts it. Several other toys lie scattered

about as she studies it, when the sound of a TICKING CLOCK

CAN BE HEARD.

A beat as Epps holds there. She turns, trying to locate the

sound. From across the room, Epps stands, listening. As the

TICKING CLOCK sounds from here. She turns, putting down the

doll, holding a beat. She approaches, crossing the room,

coming finally to a stop before us and what we come to see

is an ancient grandfather clock.

All but it's minute hand has fallen off its corroded face,

but from inside it emits a weak though steady TICKING.

Epps stands there as the clock ticks, looking on, when the

TICKING CEASES. A beat as she holds there, as the clock faces

her, now silent.

INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - LATER - DAY

Epps shines her light in the darkness as she comes to a door

where daylight falls from a small port. She looks through

it.

INT. CHIMERA - SWIMMING POOL - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

Epps stands in a white tiled room. Light falls from port

holes high in the wall. Running its length is a small swimming

pool, it's rusted fixtures and stained surface creating

bizarre patterns.

INT. CHIMERA - SWIMMING POOL - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

Epps comes to a row of changing stalls. Old clothing hangs

there, unused for fifty years. A pair of woman's shoes lie

on the floor.

INT. CHIMERA - SWIMMING POOL - LATER - DAY

Epps moves along, passing through a doorway into

INT. CHIMERA - GYMNASIUM - CONTINUOUS - DAY

Epps enters another room scattered with old exercise equipment

circa 1950, a wooden rowing machine, barbells and a medicine

ball.

She steps up to the wall, where pictures hang. The Chimera

can be seen in better days, sailing full speed on a calm

sea.

INT. CHIMERA - SUB-DECK - LATER - DAY

Epps jumps down to a lower deck. She shines her light up to

see that she is in an engine compartment, showing a massive

diesel burner. She passes through into another compartment

where the giant pistons of the ship's power plant rise up to

the ceiling.

INT. CHIMERA - SUB-DECK - PASSAGE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

Epps moves, passing still more diesel burners, towering over

her in the cavernous space. She moves into a narrowing

passage, piping and machinery ducts winding their way into

the depths of the ship.

Finally the passage opens into yet another compartment,

apparently a cargo hold. Crates and boxes are stacked on

loading palettes.

In the corner, a rotting canvas drape covers something. Epps

comes to it. She lifts the canvas, which crumbles away to

reveal a 1951 Ferrari sportster. For the exception of a coat

of dust and a small amount of corrosion, it is perfectly

preserved.

Mail bags lie in piles along the wall, stacked between more

wooden crates and palettes, when something catches Epps'

eye.

A heavy, metal door in the wall is twisted on it's hinges,

as though blown back from some terrific explosive force.

Epps approaches, coming to the twisted door. She shines her

light inside.

A clutter of debris, shelving and wood, are visible in the

shadows, when her light catches a glint of something. She

swings her light back, revealing a yellowish bright object

between broken wood slats.

Epps steps in. She kneels, shining the light closer. The

yellow glint is metal. Epps pulls back a slat, sliding away

some of the debris to reveal that it is cast from a kilogram

ingot of gold.

She reaches out. She raises it, completely untouched by the

years. She pulls back still more debris, revealing a stack

of gold ingots, some having tumbled to the side. She slides

away a large trunk that has fallen, pushing off more junk to

see that the stack is much larger, perhaps four feet high

and five feet across.

A beat as Epps stands there, looking on at $50,000,000 in

gold.

INT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - DAY

The debris has been cleared away to reveal a clean 5'x 5' x

4' stack of gold ingots.

Greer, Murphy, Epps, and Dodge all look on.

Murphy has stepped forward, taking an ingot, inspecting it.

Murphy looks up at her from the gold.

A beat as they all hold there.

Greer cackles as he high fives Dodge.

The steel hatch is twisted, as from a great hand ripping it

back from the wall.

A beat, as they all look on at the gold.

INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

After dinner, Murphy, Greer, Dodge and Epps sit around the

galley table.

A beat as they consider it.

A beat as they let this sink in.

INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - DAY

Dodge, wearing a welding mask and gloves, braises an aluminum

fitting over one of the open turbines.

INT. CHIMERA - SUB-DECK CARGO COMPARTMENT - DAY

Epps finishes stacking the gold ingots in a cleared space

beyond the twisted hatch.

Greer makes a note.

They slap hands.

INT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - PASSAGEWAY - DAY

Murphy moves down the darkened passage, coming to a door

marked "CAPTAIN." The door is ajar. He pushes it open.

INT. CHIMERA - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

Murphy stands in the doorway of a spacious cabin panelled in

dark wood. A large desk occupies a corner of the room by the

windows. Though dirty and worn with time, everything is

ordered and in its place.

Murphy comes to the desk. He sits down in the chair behind

it. The surface is clear and uncluttered. He pulls out the

drawer to reveal pens, writing paper, a ruler, compass and

protractor amidst other sundry items.

INT. CHIMERA - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER -

DAY

Murphy steps in. The room is undisturbed, light falling in

on the taught green bedspread through dirty, tattered

curtains.  A robe hangs on the back of a chair. A pair of

slippers lie beneath it.

INT. CHIMERA - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER -

DAY

Murphy stands in the bathroom. The tile has yellowed with

time, but everything is exactly as it was left. Even the

shaving kit is neatly arrayed on the sink as Murphy looks on

at it. He looks up, seeing himself in the mirror, when an

EXPLOSION SOUNDS.

EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

Murphy comes to the railing, looking out over the bow of the

ship to see black smoke rising from where the Arctic Warrior

is tied.

EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

Greer and Epps run to the side to see billowing smoke rising

from the Arctic Warrior as Murphy climbs down the crane to

the deck.

EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - DAY

Murphy jumps down to the deck. Flames belch from an open

hatch as Murphy grabs a fire extinguisher from a deck locker,

coming to the engine room door.

INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY

Murphy enters to find the engine room engulfed in flames and

black smoke. He finds Dodge spraying at it with an

extinguisher of his own.

The flames belch up from an oil fire in the turbine well,

the heat searing paint on the metal covers. Murphy sprays a

cloud of halon and the fire dims, but only for a moment.

Dodge grabs another extinguisher, his leg burned, face and

hands singed.

An EXPLOSION ROCKS THE BOAT and molten flames hurl through

the air, catching Murphy's pant leg. He's so engrossed in

fighting the flames, he doesn't realize he's on fire.

Murphy looks down to see his pant leg is on fire, as Dodge

turns a cloud of halon on him, putting it out.

Murphy crosses in the smoke, coming as close as he dares to

the most intense part of the flames. He turns the extinguisher

into them, holding it there.

The flames dim, as Dodge joins him on the other side, turning

his extinguisher on it too. The fire seems to dim yet again

as clouds of halon rise up.

Fire belches from a duct, crawling across the ceiling. Dodge

fires his extinguisher at it, pushing it back across to the

wall again.

Murphy extinguishes the last of the flames in the turbine

well as Dodge brings a snaking tendril of fire down to the

deck, and finally out.

They stand there in the sudden silence, the air heavy with

smoke. A fine layer of halon powder lies over everything,

but the fire is out.

EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - DAY

Dodge smokes a cigarette, now starting to feel his burned

leg, which is oozing as Murphy and Greer look on.

Epps arrives with a first aid kit.

Epps cuts back the burned pant leg to see the burn.

Epps cleans the burn with hydrogen peroxide.

Epps keeps cleaning as Dodge bears it.

INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT

A gas lantern sits on the map table illuminating Murphy as

he holds the radio mic.

A moment, then:

INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

Dodge pours out a few cans of cold chili into a bowl and

takes it to the table where Epps, Greer, and Murphy sit under

the stark light of a gas lantern.

A STRANGE SOUND BEGINS. IT IS LIKE A DISTANT SHRIEKING, AS

OF METAL AGAINST METAL, BUT ALMOST HUMAN, DISTANTLY ECHOING.

The SHRIEKING CONTINUES, ECHOING EERILY AS IF FROM THE SEA.

EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

Dodge, Epps, Murphy and Greer emerge on deck.

The DISTANT SHRIEKING IS LOUDER HERE, BUT SEEMS TO BE

EMANATING FROM DEEP IN THE SHIP as they stand facing it on

the bow.

They hold there listening as the SHRIEKING CONTINUES.

The DISTANT SHRIEKING ECHO continues as they hold there.

EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - DAY

The engine room is black with soot, the turbines covered in

halon powder. Dodge stands there looking at it. He sighs.

INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY - DAY

Greer goes through shelves of supplies, finding a stack of

sterno cans and warming candles. He throws them into a wooden

crate of other supplies he's gathered.

INT. CHIMERA - FIRST CLASS STATEROOM - DAY

Epps slowly pushes open the door. She holds a sack with a

few items she's managed to scavenge. Light falls from

curtained windows onto the room. A divan sits against the

wall. A table stands in the middle of the room, a moth-eaten

velvet table cloth sitting under a brass lamp on top. Two

twin beds stand on either side. They are covered in dust and

are moth-eaten, unmade, as if the occupants had just gotten

up, fifty years ago.

In one corner is an armoire. Epps steps up to it, pulling

back the door to reveal a rack of woman's clothing hanging

there undisturbed.

INT. CHIMERA - STATEROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

A pair of slippers lie on the floor beside a chair, over

which is draped a woman's robe. Epps lifts it, the material

crumbling in her hands.

INT. CHIMERA - STATEROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

A drawer comes back to reveal a number of personal affects,

a man's billfold, cuff links, tarnished silver cigarette

holder and case, coins, black horn-rimmed glasses, pocket

watch and fob, and a room key.

Epps pulls back the billfold. She opens it. Inside she finds

a Canadian passport a picture of a dark-haired man with a

mustache and black horn-rimmed glasses, circa 1950. In the

folds she finds three hundred Canadian dollars. An insert

holds pictures, of a suburban home, children, and a woman,

presumably his wife.

INT. CHIMERA - "A" DECK PASSAGE - LATER - DAY

Epps steps from the room. She turns to close the door, but

stops, holding there, strongly sensing something.

THE CAMERA SLOWLY COMES AROUND TO HER OTHER SIDE, revealing

the long passageway behind her, each bulkhead hatchway

creating the impression of a tunnel of mirrors that frame

one another and, standing at the very end of this tunnel in

the foggy light from a porthole, a MAN in dark clothing.

Epps slowly turns her head to see what she already senses,

the man standing at the end of the passageway facing her. A

beat as they hold there. The man only stares back at her,

then turns to walk away.

Epps moves off as the man walks around the corner.

MOVING WITH Epps as she breaks into a run, going down the

passageway. She comes to the corner, rounding it out onto

another passageway. The man is nowhere to be seen.

Epps moves quickly down the passageway, coming to the next

corner, rounding it out to see only another long passageway.

She turns back, running right into Murphy.

A beat as Murphy looks back at her.

INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT

Greer, Dodge, Murphy, and Epps stand around by lantern light.

A beat as they sit in silence.

A beat as Murphy, Greer and Epps exchange looks.

They consider this a moment.

A beat as they consider this.

INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - WARD LOCKER - NIGHT

Epps is dressed in her cold weather gear as she opens a

locker, revealing a flare gun and a shotgun. Epps pulls back

the shotgun and a box of shells.

EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - NIGHT

Murphy and Dodge look on as Epps loads the last of several

shotgun shells into the pump action short barrel 12-gauge.

She expertly shuttles a round into the chamber with one hand.

Dodge takes a hit from his cigarette as Greer crosses from

the deck house.

Greer extends a thermos to Epps.

She checks the squelch on her radio, pockets it too.

Her bravado does little to hide her apprehension as she slings

the shotgun on her back.

She looks up, climbs onto the crane and up toward the darkened

ship above them.

INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

A flashlight beam cuts through the darkness as Epps

approaches. If this place is creepy in the daylight, it is

terrifying now. She comes to a ladder and climbs down.

INT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT

Epps shines her light as she passes through, coming to the

cargo hold. She crosses in the darkness, her light catching

the tarnished glint of the gold. She comes up to it, stopping

there, looking on at it, a perfectly symmetrical fortune.

She looks around for a place to sit. She drags a palette to

the bulkhead, settling in to face the rest of the compartment.

She puts her shotgun down beside her and takes out her thermos

to pour herself a cup of coffee.

INT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT

Epps has dozed off when a CLATTERING ECHOES DISTANTLY

somewhere in the ship. Epps wakes. It is silent, as she holds

there, not sure she heard anything, when a DISTANT BOOMING

SOUNDS. She reaches out for the shotgun, intently listening.

As Epps holds there, another deep BOOMING sounds distantly

somewhere. Epps turns, her blood running cold.

INT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

Epps moves along in the darkness when the DISTANT BOOMING

CAN BE HEARD BRIEFLY AGAIN. She stops, holding there, in the

silence.

INT. CHIMERA - SHAFT ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

Epps jumps down into the shaft alley where the ship's massive

propeller shaft hangs suspended above her. Epps moves along.

Finally she comes out into...

INT. CHIMERA - ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

Where the propeller shaft extends into a large turbine. She

continues on, past huge rusting diesel burners, disappearing

into the darkness above her, when ANOTHER BOOM SOUNDS.

She turns, shinning her light back from where she came.

Nothing moves. Not a sound, but for her breathing and maybe

her heart pounding in her chest. ANOTHER BOOM SOUNDS, again

echoing distantly in the silence. She shines her light through

the line of burners. Nothing moves.

Epps moves quietly between the burners. She comes to a massive

watertight door at the bulkhead. She steps through, finding

herself standing between a row of huge oil storage tanks.

THE BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN, closer, as suddenly stopping.

She moves on, cautiously walking between the tanks, holding

her light out before her. She comes to the end of the

compartment and another bulkhead. The BOOMING SOUNDS, still

closer. She turns the light into the recesses, showing rusting

machinery and a stack of oil drums.

She approaches, holding the shotgun up. As she nears, the

BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN. She stops. It is coming from here.

She tenses, raising the shotgun, holding the light as steady

as she can manage. The BOOMING SOUNDS YET AGAIN. It is

metallic and staccato.

She stops in the corner beside an oil drum. Several drums

have toppled and lie scattered in a pile when a draft stirs

her hair. She shines her light up to see that she stands at

the bottom of a giant hatchway shaft rising all the way

through the ship to the top deck and an echoey breeze that

betrays a throughway to the outside.

The BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN, this time coming from the pile of

oil drums. She steps closer, raising the shotgun, ready to

fire. A beat as she summons her courage, then reaches out to

push a drum with her foot, when A BLUR EXPLODES OUT AT HER.

She fires the shotgun and a spray of buckshot glances off

the steel bulkhead in a shower of sparks, a flurry of frenetic

flapping whizzing by her head as she looks up to see a large

albatross flying back up the hatchway shaft toward the top

of the ship and freedom.

She settles back, exhausted.

She wipes her brow on her sleeve, holding there a moment,

when she smells something really awful.

She steps forward, following the smell, pushing aside the

toppled oil drums to see an unidentifiable form in the beam

of her flashlight. She steps still closer, training her light

on the form to see that it is a human torso.  A large gash

runs up its middle and the clothing has been torn by

scavenging birds.

She hesitates, then steps still closer when she steps on

something. She starts, then shines the light on the deck in

front of her where the body's decaying head looks back with

wide, unseeing eyes.

It takes everything she has just to hold there. She shines

her light back to the headless torso.

She shines her light beyond that, and up, to reveal a bent

steam pipe hanging out over the deck, stained with dried

blood, a pair of legs dangling from the pipe when, just behind

her, a booted foot comes into frame, lightly touching her.

She spins around to see another body above her. Except this

one hangs in one piece, suspended from another bent steam

pipe. It has been impaled length-wise on the pipe from rectum

to mouth.

One of its arms has rotted off and lies on the deck below

it.  A few feet away, a third body hangs impaled from another

bent pipe.

INT. CHIMERA - ENGINE ROOM - LATER - NIGHT

A lantern illuminates the impaled bodies and their various

rotting parts.

Greer, Dodge, and Epps look on as Murphy kneels over the

remains of the headless torso.

Murphy checks the pockets, finding a wallet. He looks through

it.

A beat as they consider the implications of this.

Another beat as they hold there.

A beat as nobody's too sure about this.

INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - DAY

Dodge fires up a compressor, which feebly comes to life,

turning over the turbine, then sputtering out in a cloud of

smoke.

Murphy stands at the doorway, looking on.

INT. CHIMERA - CREW QUARTERS - DAY

Epps sleeps in her bunk.

INT. CHIMERA - BETWEEN DECKS - DAY

Dodge and Greer climb down in the darkness.

INT. CHIMERA - RADIO ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY

Murphy stands in the cramped room, full of radios and

communications equipment. He looks through the shelves and

cabinets, when he opens a drawer to find a dusty bound book.

He pulls it back, opening it to see that it is a radio call

log. He takes a seat, paging through it.

INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY - WITH GREER - LATER - DAY

Greer works to disassemble a compressor mechanism. He has

difficulty getting the right purchase with his wrench, when

he slips.

A beat as he inspects his hand. In the silence A DISTANT

SHRIEK SOUNDS, maybe metal against metal or maybe human,

somewhere in the ship. He holds there, listening.

He moves on, shinning his light as he goes.

INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

Greer moves along in the darkness when he hears THE SHRIEKING

AGAIN coming from somewhere in the ship.

INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

Greer walks up a stairway, stepping into a darkened

passageway. The SHRIEKING SOUNDS, THIS TIME CLOSER, as it

echoes through the ship. He stops, holding there to listen.

INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

Greer comes out onto another deck, stopping there. He looks

down the passageway a beat, then moves on. He passes through

a hatchway in a bulkhead when A MUSIC BOX CAN BE DISTANTLY

HEARD. He stops. The song is "DAISY" ("Daisy, Daisy, give me

your answer do. I'm half crazy, oh for the love of you.").

He holds there, listening intently. A door stands open at

the other end of the passage. The MUSIC COMES FROM HERE. He

moves forward, walking toward the end of the passage, and

the light falling from the open door.

INT. CHIMERA - RADIO ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY

Murphy pages forward to the last page of the radio call log

book.

On the page his finger runs down the columns of entries,

coming to "TRANSMISSION 1 Feb 53 21:34 hrs GMT. Engine trouble

notification made to passing vessel 'St. Charles.'"

His finger moves down to the next entry, coming to:

"TRANSMISSION 2 Feb 53 09:52 hrs GMT. Dead in Water.

Notification made to passing vessel 'Normandy.'"

His finger continues: "TRANSMISSION 2 Feb 53 14:07 hrs GMT.

Captain relieved of command. Notification made to passing

vessel 'China Sea.'"

He holds there a moment, moving his finger down to the final

entry, reading: "TRANSMISSION 2 Feb 53 21:24 hrs GMT. General

SOS."

He turns the page to see only the words "GOD SAVE US" scrawled

in faded red ink. A beat as he holds there, when a CHANNEL

OPENS WITH A SHORT BURST ON MURPHY'S RADIO. He looks to it,

but there is no response from the other end. Another SHORT

BURST AND THE CHANNEL OPENS AGAIN. This time it remains open,

but no one says anything on the other end, UNTIL THE CHANNEL

CLOSES AGAIN.

Murphy takes the radio.

He waits as no response comes, then THE CHANNEL OPENS AGAIN.

Only silence from the other end as someone seems to be there,

but is not saying anything. Murphy presses the talk button.

Again, there is no response, until the CHANNEL OPENS. Murphy

holds there as he is answered by silence, WHEN A GRAVELLY,

STRANGELY DISTORTED MALE VOICE COMES BACK ON THE RADIO:

Murphy is momentarily stunned. He hits the talk button.

The RADIO CHANNEL OPENS. Only silence comes back, as if

someone were there but not speaking.

The CAMERA PUSHES IN AS MURPHY LISTENS.

The CHANNEL CLOSES as the CAMERA STOPS CLOSE ON MURPHY.

Murphy squeezes the talk button.

Only silence comes back from the radio when A MAN'S BLOOD

CURDLING SCREAM sounds from somewhere in the ship.

INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

Murphy moves quickly down the passageway when his radio

sounds.

INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY/PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

Murphy comes down the stairs and into the passageway we saw

Greer in earlier. At the end, the light from the cabin falls

from the open door as he approaches.

AT CABIN 400

As Murphy comes to the door to see Dodge standing in the

middle of the cabin.

Greer is lying supine on the floor. His legs are rigid and

his trunk is extended. His arms are flexed and twisted so

that the palms are facing away, fingers splayed, wrists

quaking over his chest as they fight to touch each other.

Murphy kneels beside him. Greer's eyelids are half closed,

his eyes rolled up into his head. His jaw is clenched, face

contorted in a bizarre grimace. And he speaks, uttering

nonsense words in harsh expulsions, as though speaking in

tongues.

INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - DAY

AN EYE - EXTREMELY CLOSE

As a light shines in it, the pupil is fixed and dilated.

BACK TO SCENE

Greer lies unconscious on a bunk, now quiet, no longer seizing

as Epps shines a flashlight into his eye, Dodge and Murphy

looking on. She turns it off, standing upright.

A beat as they consider this.

Another beat as they hold there.

Another long beat as they think about this.

Another beat as this sinks in.

INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT

A gas lantern sits on the map table illuminating Murphy as

he holds the radio mic.

No response.

Again, no response. He holds there, then finally:

Only the desolate WHITE NOISE OF EMPTY AIR COMES BACK.

INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

Greer lies unconscious as Epps looks on at him. The door

comes open and Murphy steps in.

A beat as they look on at Greer.

INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT

Murphy and Epps sit at the galley table. Epps reads the log

book Murphy found in the radio room.

A beat as they consider it.

A beat as Murphy holds there.

A beat as Murphy looks on.

Dodge holds there. He looks to Epps a beat, takes a drink of

coffee.

EXT. CHIMERA - DAY

The sun comes up over a spectacular cloud bank as the Arctic

Warrior drifts alongside the Chimera.

EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY

Murphy crosses to the deck house, climbs the stairs.

INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

Murphy opens the door, stopping dead in his tracks. A beat.

He steps forward, crossing to the corner.

The radio set lies before him, dented in and completely

demolished, as if someone had taken a bat to it.

INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

Dodge works on one of the turbines when he is grabbed from

behind and shoved into the wall. Murphy holds him fast.

Murphy shoves him hard into the wall.

Murphy tightens his grip.

Murphy tightens his grip still more.

Murphy holds there a beat longer. He shoves Dodge back letting

him go.

Dodge checks his throat as Murphy looks on.

They turn to see Epps in the hatchway.

INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

Greer stands at the galley sink finishing off the last of a

jug of water as Murphy and the others step in. He turns to

see them.

Greer smiles, raising the jug to drink as the others take a

seat, looking on at him.

A beat as they all hold there. Greer takes a seat.

Greer only holds there.

Another beat as they hold there, as Greer takes another drink

of water.

A beat as they all hold there.

A beat as they hold there, as Murphy looks back.

Another beat as they hold there.

INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - DAY

Epps and Murphy, carrying the shotgun, make their way in the

ship.

INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - FIRST MATE'S QUARTERS - DAY

Greer stops before a mirror to see himself. He finds an

aspirin bottle, goes to open it. And as he does so, he sees

that his hand is shaking uncontrollably.

INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - DAY

Dodge works over the turbine. He stops, holding there. He

looks on at the plugs and wires and hoses. A beat.

He begins pulling out the hoses and wires, grabbing at them,

yanking them loose, breaking them off.

INT. CHIMERA - RADIO ROOM - DAY

The chassis comes off an old radio to reveal a dusty

assortment of tubes and condensers. Murphy looks on at it.

WITH EPPS

A tattered, bound book lies in the refuse of a forgotten

corner. Epps picks it up. The cover has been ripped off and

the pages are torn. But, as she looks through it, she sees

that it is the ship's log.

Murphy steps over as she pages through the log book to the

very end. The last pages have been ripped out.

Epps points to a page that has been incompletely ripped out.

Epps continues to read.

A beat as they hold there, when his radio CRACKLES TO LIFE.

Murphy reaches down for his radio.

EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY

Murphy and Epps jump from the deck crane as the tug is

starting to list to one side. He crosses to the deck house

and the open engine room hatch to see that it is rapidly

filling with seawater as Greer and Dodge scramble to set a

pump hose over the DIN OF THE PUMPS.

EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

The tug is listing radically to the side, its deck awash

with seawater, as Epps, Greer, and Murphy scramble with their

gear to the crane.

Water is starting to pour out of the deckhouse hatch as the

towering framework rising over the pilothouse stabs

precariously at the bow of the Chimera.

Murphy stops to shout back at the deckhouse.

INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

Water is starting to pour in as the entire cabin lurches to

one side. Dodge wades through toward the door.

EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

Epps pulls herself up onto the deck, Greer following behind,

then Murphy.

Dodge can be seen stepping from the deckhouse on the tug,

which now lists at a near 45 degree angle.

WITH DODGE

Dodge stumbles toward the bow, slipping on the wet deck. He

goes down, sliding into the water that washes over the

starboard rail.

He pulls himself up, using a cleat to push off. A deck locker

opens and the contents tumble around him. He struggles to

pull himself up to the base of the pilothouse. He climbs up

and edges his way toward the bow.

WITH THE OTHERS

Epps, Greer and Murphy look on as Dodge climbs up on the

skewed deck crane.

WITH DODGE

The tug is slowly lurching over as Dodge climbs the crane,

the top of which is sweeping away from the Chimera.

Below, the decks of the tug are swept with seawater as it

sinks lower and lower.

WITH THE OTHERS

They look on as Dodge climbs toward them, the sinking tug

pulling Dodge and the crane away from the ship.

Greer pulls back a line, tying it into the deck railing.

WITH DODGE

As Dodge makes his way up, he's forced to climb onto the

other side of the crane to keep from dangling over the water.

Above, Greer casts a line. It falls near, but out of reach

as the swell of the water starts to swing the crane to and

fro.  Dodge reaches out for the line again, his hand coming

close but not close enough.

The swell brings the crane toward the boat one last time and

Dodge reaches out, his fingers just coming to the line,

coaxing it into his grasp. He pulls it back and hangs on, as

the crane sways back with the foundering boat.

The crane falls away from Dodge, leaving him hanging in space

by the line from the bow of the Chimera.

WITH THE OTHERS

Murphy, Greer and Epps look on as Dodge hangs over the water

and the tug as its stern slowly sinks beneath the waves.

Dodge climbs the line toward the bow railing as the tug rolls

still further to port, the pilothouse dipping into the sea,

slipping lower and lower.

WITH DODGE

As he pulls himself upward, coming to the bottom of the rail

well on the Chimera where Murphy reaches out, just short of

Dodge's hand.

A SCREECHING SOUNDS and they turn to see the twin tow cables

coming taught against the hull in the anchor alley's of the

Chimera as the sinking tug pulls them tight.

With a CONCUSSIVE STRIKE, one cable is freed, snapping against

the Chimera's hull like a giant steel guitar string.  It

starts sliding along the hull as the tug drifts, pulling the

cable with it, toward Dodge as he dangles in mid air.

Dodge pulls himself up, reaching for Murphy, but still short.

A LOUD HISSING SOUNDS and Dodge turns to see misty air

escaping from ports and deck vents as the encroaching water

forces it out of the tug below decks.

The tow cable LOUDLY SCRAPES THE HULL in a shower of rust,

as Dodge struggles to pull himself up.

Murphy reaches out as Dodge extends as far as he can, their

hands barely reaching.

The tow cable is a mere few feet away and closing, ready to

scrape Dodge into the water or smear him across the hull

like a bug on a windshield, when Dodge pulls himself up with

everything he's got and Murphy grabs his hand.

Murphy pulls, lifting Dodge, as Greer grabs Dodge's other

hand and they pull him up, the tow cable sweeping by with a

SICKENING GRINDING SOUND OF HEAVY STEEL AGAINST STEEL.

Dodge turns to see the bow of the tug dip below the surface,

slowly going under until disappearing with a last exhalation

of misty air. The pilothouse is next to go, the last of it

slipping into the frothing water, then the crane, finally

disappearing altogether into the depths.

A long beat as they hold there in the sudden silence, phantom

bubbles rising to the surface where the tug once stood.

EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - DAY

A boot punches through a rotten wood hull.

Greer stands at the bow of a lifeboat suspended from halyards

above the deck.

Greer jumps down as Murphy, Dodge, and Epps look on.

Dodge turns to see Greer. A beat.

A beat. Dodge takes a swing at Greer.

Murphy holds on to Dodge as he will have none of it.

Dodge jumps forward again, but Murphy hangs on.

Murphy shoves Dodge back.

A beat as Greer and Murphy hold there.

EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - NIGHT

A fire burns in an oil drum as Epps, Murphy, Dodge and Greer

sit around it in silence.

INT. CHIMERA - 4TH OFFICER'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

Epps steps in. She shines her light on the room. It is exactly

as it was left. She crosses to the bed, shining her light

under it. She sits down, trying it.

INT. CHIMERA - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT

Dodge moves in the darkness, coming to the corner where the

stacked gold ingots rest. He looks on at them.

Dodge turns to see Murphy standing there.

A beat as they look on at the gold.

Murphy tosses the shotgun to Dodge, who catches it.

Murphy holds there a beat longer, then turns to go, as Dodge

looks after him.

EXT. CHIMERA - DAY

A grey chop gently rocks the Chimera, smoke rising from the

top deck.

EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - DAY

Greer and Dodge tend the flames of three fire barrels, adding

broken up furniture to create heavy signal smoke.

INT. CHIMERA - PANTRY - DAY

Murphy moves through the pantry area with a pillow case,

scavenging for food.

INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY - DAY

Epps scavenges for food in the semi-darkness of the large,

open galley, when a MOVEMENT CAN BE HEARD SOMEWHERE BEYOND

THE ENTRY separating the galley from the outer passageway.

No one answers. She looks off across the stillness of the

galley. Nothing.

INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

Epps steps into the passageway. Directly across is the entry

to the swimming pool. She walks on.

INT. CHIMERA - SWIMMING POOL - DAY

Epps steps in. Light falls in from the dirty port holes at

the ceiling, every movement echoing off the hard tile walls.

She holds there a beat, then turns to go when she sees a

GIRL of about 16 facing her on the other side of the pool.

Epps holds there, as the girl only looks back. She is

porcelain white, flaxen hair drawn behind her head, her

clothing hanging loosely from a frail body.

A beat as Epps stands there.

From this distance and in the light it is hard to fully

discern the girl's features.

A HATCH CLOSES SOMEWHERE IN THE SHIP. Epps turns to look.

When she turns back the girl is gone. A quiet "TICK" SOUND

ECHOES in the pool. She looks down to see that the pool is

now very, very deep, like a mine shaft falling away into the

depths. And, as she stands there, dark water is quickly rising

up from the bottom.

She steps back as the water gradually fills the pool to the

top. It is very dark and the bottom is indiscernible, when

the water begins to churn, as from bubbles of air reaching

the surface. Epps steps closer, looking on as a faint red

glow can be seen deep in the water below the churning bubbles.

As she watches, the red glow grows in intensity. The glow

spreads, illuminating a broad area until it becomes clear

that the water is not water at all but blood.

And, as the light grows still brighter, a figure is

illuminated, well below the surface as it seems to rise up.

Epps looks on as the figure rises higher into the light. It

is a MAN, fighting desperately to reach the surface. The

bubbles that rise up are produced from his silent screams.

Epps starts forward, but another figure rises to the same

point, a WOMAN, also struggling. Another MAN floats up, then

another, and another, people floating up, fighting desperately

to reach the surface, unable to do so, drowning in blood.

Epps reaches out over the edge, plunging her hand into the

blood, reaching for the man's hand, but they are too far

apart.

She struggles desperately as the man fights to get to the

surface.

The others are fighting for the surface too, as Epps reaches

out, near tears, helpless to do anything.

Everything suddenly stops. A beat as Epps only holds there.

The blood is gone, as are the people. The pool is back to

its normal state as though nothing had happened, Epps looking

on in disbelief.

Epps looks up to see Murphy standing at the door.

A beat as she holds there, looking on at the pool.

EXT. CHIMERA - FOREWARD DECK - NIGHT

Greer, Murphy, Dodge, and Epps sit on deck around the fire.

Epps coaxes a hit out of her last cigarette.

INT. CHIMERA - 1ST OFFICER'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

The SOUND OF SOMEONE BREATHING HARD CAN BE HEARD in the dark

room. As the CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES INTO THE ROOM, we see that

it is Greer, lying on the bed. His body is tense and his

arms arch rigidly toward his chest. His jaw is clenched and

he expels harsh, guttural utterances, experiencing something

between a night terror and a seizure.

INT. CHIMERA - WHEELHOUSE - DAY

Sheets of rain come down on the deck in the grey light of

morning. Murphy stands on the bridge, looking off at it coming

down when Greer steps in.

Greer crosses to the window, stepping up.

Murphy nods as he looks out.

INT. CHIMERA - PURSERS OFFICE - DAY

A file drawer comes open, revealing ticket receipts.

Epps looks on at it. The receipts are labeled "FULL FARE

PASSAGES" and are divided by first, second, and third class.

She goes through them, coming to a section that says

"ACCOMPANIED CHILDREN."

She pulls out the folder, laying it on the counter, opening

it. The first page is a receipt for a single passage to

Halifax for a Tatterly, Stephen age: 14. She pulls it back

to reveal another, Wilson, Harold age: 4. Another, Vitti,

Angela age: 17.

She pages through the stack, looking at the ages: 3, 15, 6,

11, 1, until coming across a 9. She looks to the name, Klein,

David, a boy. She continues paging through the receipts coming

to another 9. She stops, looking to the name, Nichols,

Katherine age: 16. A girl. She looks to the cabin assignment:

"400." She notes that it is the same cabin where Greer was

found, when a REVERBERANT CONCUSSION SOUNDS THROUGH THE SHIP.

EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

Dodge runs to the side to see a 15 feet wide by 40 feet tall

steel and concrete mid-ocean buoy bounce off the transom as

the ship drifts into it.

WITH GREER AND MURPHY

They come to the side at the wheelhouse, seeing the bright

orange letters "NOAA" emblazoned on the buoy's float pod as

the ship drifts by.

EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

Dodge quickly ties a loop in a coil of docking line as Greer,

Epps, and Murphy look on at the approaching buoy.

Dodge finishes as Epps ties the other end off to a cleat.

ON THE BUOY

As it drifts along the side of the Chimera. Murphy drops the

line down, the buoy bouncing on the swell.

BACK TO SCENE

Murphy pulls the loop up as the buoy nears, aiming to hook

it on its wind gauge.

ON THE BUOY

The buoy approaches, rising and falling with the swell.

BACK TO SCENE

Murphy corrects.

Murphy holds the loop steady.

ON THE BUOY

The loop is too low. It's going to miss the mark as the buoy

drifts toward it, when the swell drops and the buoy goes

down.

BACK TO SCENE

Murphy yanks on the line.

ON THE BUOY

And the loop catches on the wind gauge.

BACK TO SCENE

As the line goes taught he pulls his hands away just in time,

the line snapping hard against the rail. Below, the buoy

heels over as it's pulled.

ON THE BUOY

It drops with the swell, the line stretching, then swinging

the giant concrete buoy float into the side of the hull with

a huge BOOMING CLANG.

BACK TO SCENE

The line is smoking with the friction, the steel railing

bowing a little with the weight as they look on.

ON THE BUOY

As the buoy falls again with a swell and slams into the side

of the ship. The water returns, lifting it high.

The ship is dragging it back and it begins to rise up as its

mooring comes taught. The line rises with it and soon the

buoy is at a steep angle as it comes out of the water.

BACK TO SCENE

The buoy is held fast between the docking line and its own

mooring.

ON THE BUOY

The buoy rises fully from the water, all three tons of it,

and as it does, the wind gauge's steel mount begins to bend.

BACK TO SCENE

As they watch the buoy suspended over the water between the

creaking docking line and its own underwater mooring cable.

ON THE BUOY

The gauge mount snaps and the docking line flails free,

sending the buoy hurtling back into the water in a curtain

of spray, whipping wildly from side to side.

BACK TO SCENE

The buoy swings back and forth as it rights itself, rising

on a swell, passing beyond the bow of the Chimera.

They look on in silence, the buoy slowly receding as the

ship drifts away.

EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - NIGHT

Murphy stands watch by the fire as Epps joins him.

They watch the fire in silence for a moment.

A beat as she looks back at him. She looks back to the fire,

watching it.

She looks up to Murphy.

A beat as she only looks back.

Another beat as he looks on at her.

A beat as Murphy looks back, as she sees him.

A beat as he holds there.

A beat as she looks back.

Another beat as he holds on her.

She only looks back at him, then into the fire.

She starts to get up.

She stands, looking back at him.

She holds there a beat longer, then turns, walking off.

INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - LATER - DAY

Epps comes to the 2nd officer's door, knocks.

INT. CHIMERA - 4TH OFFICERS ROOM - NIGHT

Epps sits down on the bed. She lies back, not sleepy. A beat

as she holds there in the darkness.

EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - NIGHT

Murphy still sits by the fire as Dodge groggily approaches

from the officers quarters, carrying a blanket and a jug of

water.

INT. CHIMERA - 1ST OFFICER'S STATEROOM - NIGHT

Greer lies asleep on the bed. But his sleep is fitful,

increasingly agitated, tormented. It is as if he tries to

speak, but cannot. As THE CAMERA PUSHES SLOWLY IN, his words

are forced and garbled, speaking in the same nonsensical

language he spoke earlier, when he wakes with a start.

EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - NIGHT

Dodge dozes, cradling the shotgun in his arms, when MUSIC

CAN BE HEARD VERY DISTANTLY. Dodge wakes. It is "Daisy"

playing on a music box somewhere in the ship.

INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

Dodge moves along as the MUSIC BOX DISTANTLY CONTINUES.

INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY/PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

Dodge moves cautiously down the stairway into another

passageway.

He approaches from the other end. He passes the open doors

of stateroom after stateroom. The MUSIC BOX IS CLOSER HERE.

It stops.

He holds there in the darkness. He turns, shining his light

back down the passageway. A beat. It is silent, when the

CHANNEL OF HIS RADIO OPENS WITH A SHORT BURST.

He raises his radio. But no one says anything, the CHANNEL

REMAINING OPEN, a discernible presence on the other end.

SOMEONE'S POV - FROM THE FAR END

SLOWLY MOVING TOWARD DODGE as he can be seen from the other

end of the passageway.

BACK TO SCENE

He gets no response, then presses the talk button.

He is answered by silence, the CHANNEL REMAINING OPEN, WHEN

THE GRAVELLY DISTORTED VOICE THAT MURPHY HEARD COMES BACK ON

THE RADIO:

Dodge hits the talk button.

The RADIO CHANNEL OPENS, but only silence comes back.

SOMEONE'S POV - FROM THE FAR END

SLOWLY MOVING TOWARD DODGE as he can be seen from the far

end of the passageway.

BACK TO SCENE

Only silence returns on the radio as Dodge holds there, then:

THE CAMERA PUSHES SLOWLY IN ON DODGE as he listens.

Dodge senses something behind him. He turns, and before he

can draw a breath to shout, SOMETHING HEAVY SLAMS INTO HIM

IN THE DARKNESS, his flashlight tumbling away in a squiggle

of light.

ON SHOTGUN

As the shotgun clatters to the deck, the muzzle resting in

frame as the radio falls a few feet away. A beat. The shotgun

muzzle slides out of frame as some unseen person or thing

pulls it away.

EXT. CHIMERA - DAY

A grey overcast stretches to the horizon.

EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - DAY

Murphy comes out onto the deck. Dodge is nowhere to be seen.

INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY STORAGE COMPARTMENT - DAY

Epps shines her light on something.

Greer raises his light to reveal rows of canned goods. They

are industrial sized cans, from the 1950s. Greer takes one.

Epps' radio CRACKLES AWAKE.

She looks to Greer who shakes his head.

EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - LATER - DAY

Dodge's stuff is laid out under the shelter of a vent duct

as Greer, Epps, and Murphy stand over it. A blanket, a pillow

and a plastic jug of water are all that remain.

A beat as they hold there.

INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - DAY

Greer and Epps move along as Murphy raises his radio.

INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

Dodge's radio lies in the detritus of the ship as Murphy's

voice can be heard on it.

INT. CHIMERA - ENGINEERING - LATER - DAY

Epps moves cautiously along in the darkness.

WITH MURPHY

As he moves along as well, eyes open.

WITH GREER

As Greer moves along too.

INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - LATER - DAY

Epps jumps down, shining her light over machinery and across

bulkheads when a WHISPERING CAN BE HEARD somewhere. She holds

there, listening. It is echoey, distant.

No response as Epps holds there. The WHISPERING SOUNDS AGAIN,

far off, unintelligible. It stops.

She moves on, shinning her light.

INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

Epps moves along in the darkness, holding the flashlight

before her, when the WHISPERING SOUNDS AGAIN.

Epps stops, holding there in the silence. She reaches for

her radio. The WHISPERING SOUNDS AGAIN. Epps turns to pinpoint

it, coming from somewhere in the cavernous space.

INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

Epps passes under a catwalk. She moves on, passing a row of

standpipes. Epps stops, listening. Somewhere, the WHISPERING

CAN BE HEARD, then stops.

It is absolutely silent. In the darkness behind her, the

GIRL (KATIE) PULLS BACK INTO THE SHADOWS.

Epps holds there a beat, then turns, running into Greer with

a start.

She holds there a beat, looking around.

They start to leave, when Epps notices something. She stops.

Beyond the standpipes, a faint glow can be seen in the

darkness. Epps steps forward, crossing to it. Greer follows.

MOVING WITH EPPS

As Epps approaches, Greer behind her. The light is dim and

low to the deck. She stops.

WITH THE LIGHT

As Epps starts toward it again. She and Greer come up to it,

stopping there. She kneels, the dim glow shining on her. She

reaches out toward it, pulling back Dodge's flashlight, still

on.

She turns it off, standing. She shines her light into the

darkness and starts off, Greer following.

INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

Epps and Greer move along, shining their lights as they go,

when something catches in the beam of Epps' flashlight.

It is Dodge's radio. They stop over it. Epps picks it up,

inspecting it. She looks to Greer, when a single dark spot

appears on Epps' cheek. It begins to run, a crimson tear.

She raises her hand to touch it, inspecting her finger to

see that it is blood.

She looks to Greer. They both look up to see, hanging

suspended above them, Dodge's face staring back down at them

from the darkness.

He has been imperfectly impaled, the sharp point of a high

pressure steam pipe protruding from his neck, head hanging

limp beside it.

INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - LATER - DAY

Greer and Murphy lower Dodge's body on a rope as Epps guides

it to the deck. They stand looking on at it a moment.

INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - DAY

Epps enters the dim passageway from the bright daylight. She

moves down the passage, coming finally to the stateroom where

Greer was found, room 400.

She holds there a beat, then reaches for the door, hesitating.

She opens it.

INT. CHIMERA - STATEROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY

The door comes open and Epps steps in. It is dark, though

spacious. It is divided into two rooms. Beyond the sitting

room in the front, is a bedroom.

Epps steps in. A dressing table sits against the far wall.

A large bed is unmade. Suitcases lie open on stands at the

foot of the bed, still half full as if they were in the

process of being unpacked.

From one, she pulls back a woman's gown, a blouse. The other

contains shirts, trousers, socks, and underwear.

Across the room a smaller suitcase can be seen lying open on

an Ottoman in the corner. Epps crosses to it. She finds a

few shirts, and a red print dress, some books. She takes one

of the books, opening it.

Inscribed on the inside of the cover is: "This book belongs

to:" and then written in by hand: "Katie Nichols."

A page is marked with a purple ribbon. She opens it to see a

children's poem "The Rooster and the Crow" and a drawing of

a rooster and a crow and a stanza of a poem: "'Cock-a-doodle

doo,' said the rooster to the crow. 'Where are you now? I

know, but won't say so.'" She puts it down. A tin penny

whistle sits on the table. She picks it up, examining it.

She opens a small picture book, thumbing through to see photos

of a family, a young mother and father at the beach, the

mother and a girl of about 9 years, the girl and an older

girl of about 16, the girl she saw at the swimming pool,

KATIE. Epps holds on this picture, when A MUSIC BOX SOUNDS.

She looks up to the dressing table. On it a music box slowly

plays "Daisy."

AT THE TABLE

Epps crosses to it, looking on at the music box as it slowly

winds down, then finally stops. A beat. She picks it up,

looking at it, when she looks up to see Greer standing there.

A beat.

The dirty white light falling into the room through the

windows falls on him as he looks off at something we cannot

see. His expression is empty, hollow.

He does not hear her as he stands there. She approaches,

stepping up.

Another beat, as he looks off, into the light, when he slowly

turns to see her.

A long beat as she looks back. He holds there, the same empty

look about him, when he grabs her by the throat and squeezes

hard.

She is stunned, breathless, but raises her hands to grip his

wrists, fighting him.

His grip tightens. He is much stronger and her efforts make

little difference.

She hangs on, starting to choke. She drops one hand, searching

with it.

He speaks nonsense, his face distorted in an ugly grimace,

eyes bulging as Epps fumbles over the table, a tray of glass

and silver crashing to the floor as he pushes her back, still

choking her.

He backs her to the wall, pushing in, closing her windpipe

the rest of the way.

Her hand searches behind her, knocking over a small vase, a

basket, some books. It comes to a brass desk lamp. It falls,

a little out of reach.

She is going to black out any second, as Greer strangles

her.

Her hand comes to the desk lamp, grabbing it.

She raises the lamp, swinging with all her might, connecting

with Greer's head.

He stumbles back, a gash laid into his face, as Epps sucks

in air, gagging and coughing, her neck purple with finger

marks.  She fumbles her radio up.

Blood is running down his face as Greer comes for her again.

She throws down the radio.

A bed stands between them. She feints right, then left. He's

dazed and has blood in his eyes. She manages to slip by, but

he dives, taking her down.

He drags her back along the floor, spinning her around. He

raises a fist to ram into her face when WHAM!

Epps has shoved the butt of her flashlight into his crotch

and he comes up SCREAMING. He grabs her face, striking her

with his other hand.

She swings the flashlight again and cracks him across the

head. He swings yet again and connects, knocking her across

the floor.

She lies in a heap as Greer climbs to his feet, enraged and

bleeding.

He unbuckles his belt as he approaches, pulling it from his

waist to do God knows what.

Epps looks around to see him approaching. And we see that

she has unhinged her gill knife.

As his foot steps near, she lets go and drives the knife

with all her might into his boot, plunging the blade through

his foot and into the floor. He SCREAMS.

After a moment he stops, looks to her. He is a bloody,

wretched, enraged mess. He starts toward her as Murphy appears

in the doorway.

Just as Greer is upon her, Murphy blind sides Greer from

behind at full speed, knocking him down.

Greer and Murphy struggle as Epps climbs unsteadily to her

feet. She staggers to them and raises the flashlight over

Greer, bringing it down on his head.

CUT TO BLACK

INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - LATER - DAY

Epps and Murphy carry Greer's unconscious body.

INT. CHIMERA - AQUARIUM TANK - LATER - DAY

Greer tumbles down a sand bank in an empty aquarium. He stops

at the bottom, now starting to come to.

OUTSIDE

Murphy slams the door shut as Epps looks on. She puts a steel

pipe across the hatch lever so that it cannot be opened.

INT. CHIMERA - AQUARIUM TANK - LATER - DAY

Greer sits in the tank, visible through a large piece of

armored aquarium glass, amidst the fake coral. He sits in

the sand hugging his legs to his chest, bobbing slightly as

he speaks in his nonsensical language.

Murphy and Epps look on from the outside in the promenade.

They watch him in silence a moment as Greer mutters and bobs.

Greer gets up, comes to the window, looking out at them. He

presses his face to the glass.

A beat as Epps looks off. In the window Greer drags his

hideously distorted face over the glass, the blood from his

wounds smearing in broad red streaks.

EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - DAY

A partial hull of a rotting life boat falls into frame. Epps

and Murphy stand over it.

A beat as they look on at the rotting hull.

EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - DAY

Epps and Murphy work to lash parts of the rotting boats into

a single usable raft.

INT. CHIMERA - AQUARIUM TANK - DAY

Greer lies asleep on the sand bottom of the tank, the white

light from the skylight falling on him from above.

INT. CHIMERA - STORAGE AREA - DAY

Epps has found a reel of wire and some metal braces, making

her way into the darkness, when her radio CRACKLES TO LIFE.

The channel remains silent a moment, then closes. She stops,

raises the radio.

She waits, holding there as only silence comes back.

Again, only silence comes back until, after a moment, the

channel opens again. No one speaks, though there is a palpable

presence on the other end.

The channel opens again, only silence returning. The sound

of the MUSIC BOX CAN BE HEARD, "DAISY" COMING BACK OVER THE

RADIO.

INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

Epps walks along in the darkness AS THE MUSIC BOX CONTINUES

TO PLAY OVER THE RADIO. She comes to the end of the corridor,

stopping there.

At the other end the light falls from the door at room 400.

The MUSIC FROM THE RADIO STOPS, leaving in its absence the

MUSIC AS IT CAN BE HEARD COMING FROM THE ROOM AT THE END OF

THE CORRIDOR.

INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

Epps approaches the other end, from where the MUSIC EMANATES,

coming to a stop at room 400. A beat as she holds there.

INT. CHIMERA - ROOM 400 - CONTINUOUS - DAY

Epps steps in as THE MUSIC BOX PLAYS IN THE OTHER ROOM.

The sitting room is dark as she holds there. After a moment,

she continues on, coming to the bedroom.

Epps steps in. Across the room the MUSIC BOX IS PLAYING.

She crosses, coming to it as it continues, when her radio

CRACKLES TO LIFE. The channel remains silent a moment, then:

She holds there a beat, then crosses to the table to find

the book of nursery rhymes. She opens it to the nursery rhyme

"The Rooster and the Crow," seeing the same words on the

page, when the radio CRACKLES AGAIN.

On the table is the penny whistle she saw earlier. She takes

it, holding on it a moment. She raises it and THE CAMERA

SLOWLY PUSHES IN as she puts it to her lips and lightly blows

a C-SHARP WHICH BECOMES A C-SHARP FROM A PENNY WHISTLE across

the room.

On the other side of the room, the younger girl from the

photo plays the penny whistle. She is sitting on the floor

with the MOTHER who reads from the book we saw earlier.

The room is warm with light, restored to its original

condition some fifty years ago as Epps stands there, unseen,

no longer holding the whistle.

A man, the FATHER from the photos, steps from the bathroom

wearing a new coat.

Katie joins them from the outer room.

INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

Epps steps from room 400 into the passageway. It is lit with

sconces running its length and the elegant furnishings and

objets d'art stretching to the far end are all in their

original condition. DISTANT MUSIC FROM THE BALLROOM CAN BE

HEARD as Epps stands there. She moves along.

INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

Epps walks in the passageway. Doors are open and she looks

in to see people doing various things, some packing and

putting their things in order.

INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

Epps walks down the passage, rounding the corner to see three

STEWARDS fighting with a fourth MAN in a tuxedo. They lift

him up and carry him off down the stairs as he shouts and

protests. She moves on, through a pair of double doors, into

INT. CHIMERA - STORAGE COMPARTMENT - CONTINUOUS - DAY

Epps moves through the now lighted storage area off the

galley. A group of CREWMEN stand around at the other end

and, as Epps nears, she sees that four figures can be seen

among them. They are four men, OFFICERS, swaying gently from

the ship's movement as they hang from ropes around their

neck, dead. Epps keeps moving, through doors at the other

end.

INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

A commotion can be heard at the other end of the passageway

as Epps keeps moving. A WOMAN SCREAMS, and is cut off when a

door slams shut.

The DISTANT MUSIC HAS BEEN REPLACED WITH INDISCERNIBLE

SHOUTING, as of someone commandeering the microphone somewhere

As she walks, she passes an open door where several CREWMEN

fight over a steamer trunk, which breaks open, scattering

the contents.

INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT

Epps walks along, coming to another door where a dead man

and woman are laying in the middle of the room as a STEWARD

takes money from a wallet. The steward looks up, reaches

over and slams the door shut. She continues on.

Another door stands open as she comes to it, back at room

400. She stops. A REPETITIVE SOUND CAN BE HEARD, coming from

inside.

INT. CHIMERA - ROOM 400 - CONTINUOUS - DAY

Epps steps in as the SOUND CONTINUES. She crosses the sitting

room, coming to the doorway of the bedroom to find several

MUTINEERS, some in stewards attire, others wearing ships

officers caps, obviously taken from their rightful owners.

The repetitive sound comes from here, bed springs. And, from

between the men, a woman's bare legs hang over the end of

the bed as a pair of man's legs in boots lie between them,

the bed rocking, the others looking on.

Epps turns to see the father. He is on his knees, hands tied

behind his back as he is forced to watch from the foot of

the bed.

EPPS LOOKS DOWN TO SEE

EPPS' POV

a geometric pattern of a lotus on the Persian carpet at her

feet. When she looks up again she sees what the father sees.

The mutineer finishes, climbing off the woman. Another of

the men pulls her up to reveal that she is no woman at all,

but Katie.

The mother and sister lie in a bloody heap near-by as one of

the other mutineers steps up to Epps.

The mutineer steps back to the bed. He sits Katie down so

that she faces us on the end of the bed. He raises an axe

over her, bringing it down as the world becomes a whirling

blur --

BACK TO SCENE

The CAMERA STOPS ON KATIE standing on the other side of the

room, now empty of people, returned to its shabby, abandoned

state.

Epps looks back at her from the other side of the room where

she stands.

A LOUD GUNSHOT SOUNDS SOMEWHERE IN THE SHIP. When Epps turns

back Katie is gone.

INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

Epps moves quickly along, raising her radio.

Only WHITE NOISE COMES BACK.

Only WHITE NOISE COMES BACK as she rounds the corner out

onto the promenade. At the other end, the aquarium can be

seen.

As she approaches she sees that the tank is empty. Greer is

nowhere to be seen and the skylight at the top is broken

out.

A GREAT BOOMING SHUDDER rocks the ship. A LOUD SCREECHING OF

METAL follows it.

EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

The ship's hull being scraped at the waterline by a jagged

mid-ocean island no bigger than fifty or sixty feet across.

The ship has entered a small archipelago of such islands, a

mine field for a drifting ship.

INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

Epps moves quickly along, coming to the stairway, moving up,

almost running into Murphy on his way down, carrying a canvas

duffle.

INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

Epps and Murphy move quickly along, when another HUGE BOOMING

shudders the ship and the SHRIEKING OF METAL follows.

EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

The ship bounces off another of the small, jagged islands as

it drifts past, buckling the steel plate of the hull

precariously.

INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

Murphy and Epps run toward the other end of the ship. As

they do, something can be seen lying in the middle of the

passage some distance down.

AT THE OTHER END

Epps and Murphy slow to see that it is a body, lying face

down in the passage.

They step up. Epps kneels as Murphy looks on. She rolls the

body over. It is Greer, dead.

Murphy kneels too, looking on at Greer's lifeless eyes.

INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY/PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

Murphy and Epps come up the stairway, crossing to the doors.

EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

As Epps and Murphy come out, moving toward the make-do raft.

She joins him and they lift it off its stand, taking it to

the rail.

Epps crosses back to the stands.

AT THE STANDS

Epps kneels. No hammer. She pulls back Murphy's canvas duffle,

folding back the flap to reveal a shotgun, the shotgun Dodge

had when he died.

A beat as she holds there, when Murphy's hand grabs it.

A beat as she looks to Murphy.

He only looks back at her as she stands there.

He raises the shotgun.

He prepares to fire, when a CONCUSSION ROCKS THE SHIP. Epps

ducks and Murphy fires, a spatter of buckshot shredding the

vent behind her. A SCREECHING OF METAL DEEP IN THE SHIP SOUNDS

as she gets up, diving for cover as Murphy shuttles the gun

again.

WITH EPPS

Epps scrambles behind a deck vent.

EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

The ship has bounced off yet another small island, the jagged

rocks loudly scrapping the hull with a deafening shriek.

EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

Murphy crosses toward the deck vent.

WITH EPPS

As Epps holds there she sees the vent opening. She pulls

herself up and climbs inside.

INT. CHIMERA - AIR SHAFT - CONTINUOUS - DAY

Epps climbs down the air shaft where a giant fan spans its

width. She squeezes through the fan blades and drops down

where several vent ducts lead in different directions below

it.

EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

Murphy comes to the vent duct where Epps went down.

INT. CHIMERA - AIR DUCT - CONTINUOUS - DAY

Epps crawls through. She comes to a vent that leads out to a

passageway.

INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

Murphy runs quickly down the stairway, shotgun at the ready.

INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

The vent is shoved out and falls to the metal catwalk.

INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

The CLANG FROM THE VENT SOUNDS HERE and Murphy stops.

INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

Epps extends her feet and climbs down into the passage.

INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

Murphy rounds the corner, moving on the same deck.

INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

Epps moves along on a metal catwalk in the darkness when

something can be heard ahead of her. She stops.

FOOTSTEPS SOUND at the end of the passage. Epps pulls back

into the shadows, holding there.

The footsteps sound as if they are coming down stairs at the

other end, when the FOOTSTEPS STOP.

Epps holds there, listening intently in the silence when, at

the other end, THE SOUND OF CREAKING METAL, as from a hatch

slowly opening, can be heard. It stops. All is silent, WHEN

THE HATCH CREAKS AGAIN at the other end. She begins moving

toward it.

As she approaches, she can see that the hatch is half open,

swaying slightly with the movement of the ship.

A CREAKING SOUNDS behind her. She turns, just as Murphy steps

into view. She ducks as he fires and a spray of buckshot

ricochets off the metal around her.

She scrambles on her belly as Murphy fires again. She swings

down from the catwalk, letting herself fall to the next deck.

AT THE BOTTOM

Epps gets up, runs.

WITH MURPHY

Murphy climbs down a ladder to the lower decks.

INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

Epps moves quickly along.

INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

Murphy follows, when A RUMBLING SOUND CAN BE HEARD.

INT. CHIMERA  - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

Epps stops where she is in the cavernous engine room, looking

on at the massive hull rising above her as the RUMBLING GROWS

IN INTENSITY. Though it seems to resonate throughout the

ship, it seems to originate from here, from directly below,

as though the hull were being dragged over a rocky bottom.

She steps back as the sound grows still louder, until it

becomes absolutely deafening.

The ship begins to shudder. The steel bulkheads visibly move

and the steel plates in the hull can be seen to bend back

and forth.

INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

Murphy slows and finally stops.

INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

A few rivets pop in the hull. Then a few more, as the RUMBLING

GROWS STILL LOUDER.

Epps puts her hands to her ears and begins to back away,

when the RUMBLING REACHES A PINNACLE. The rivets are springing

out of the hull like machine gun fire when the steel plate

of the hull gives way, A MASSIVE CRAG OF ROCK SMASHING THROUGH

WITH A TREMENDOUS BOOM AND A TORRENT OF SEAWATER.

Epps ducks for cover as the crag tears a diagonal line through

the Chimera's hull like a jagged claw through paper in a

HORRENDOUS TUMULT OF NOISE AND STEAM AND SPARKS.

EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

The Chimera is impaled broadside by a particularly devious

rock promontory of a small island.

INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

The giant claw begins to pull back, as the ship drifts off,

water pouring in behind it.

EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

The ship is drifting free of the island with the current, a

huge gash rising on its port side.

INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

A massive torrent sweeps over Epps as seawater pours in

through the breach.

INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

Murphy stops where he is to see water rushing in at the end

of the passage. He begins backing away.

INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

Epps is forced under as the water in the hull is already

half way up the side, the ship listing WITH A GREAT GROANING

EXERTION.

INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

Murphy moves down the passageway, coming to the cargo

compartment.

INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS WITH EPPS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

Epps comes up for air. A clatter of all manner of debris,

tools and general detritus hammers against the far bulkhead

as the ship eases over. A boiler breaks loose of its stays.

Epps looks up to see it coming right for her. She ducks under

the water as the boiler slams into the bulkhead where she

was.

WITH EPPS

Epps is forced down by the boiler, trapped between it and

the bulkhead.

INT. CHIMERA - CARGO HOLD - CONTINUOUS - DAY

The gold slides off the palette, crashing into the far wall.

Murphy hurries to it, collecting ingots and putting them in

his pockets.

INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

Epps struggles under the water to free herself, but she is

trapped, the heavy boiler and its broken stays caging her.

ABOVE THE WATER

The level of the water has now almost completely reached the

deck above, filling the ship almost entirely below decks.

INT. CHIMERA - CARGO HOLD - CONTINUOUS - DAY

The water is threateningly high as Murphy pockets one last

ingot and makes his way for the exit.

INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - CONTINUOUS - DAY

Epps is trying to pull back the boiler stays, without luck.

She swims down lower, finding a pipe fitting she pries at

the stays, without luck, when a form drifts into view in the

murky water.

Several more forms appear. They are human, suspended in the

water. As Epps looks, the several forms have become many.

They are the bodies of the dead she saw in the pool before.

As they look on at her from where they are, one form emerges.

It is Katie.

She reaches toward Epps, as if beckoning her to take her

hand from the other side. Epps raises her hand, taking it.

The girl leads Epps down into the murky darkness where she

finds a way out. She takes her back further, coming to the

breech, leading her out and into a cool green void of water.

Katie stops at the breach. Epps turns to her. She only looks

back at Epps. Epps turns away, swimming upward toward the

light of the surface.

EXT. OCEAN SURFACE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

Epps breaks through, gasping for air. She looks to see the

Chimera, listing heavily to one side, its bow decks fully

awash.

INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

Murphy staggers through the flooded passage.

EXT. OCEAN SURFACE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

The Chimera is getting lower in the water, the bow submerged

and the stern beginning to rise.

Epps sees another small island some distance off. She begins

swimming toward it.

INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

Water runs down the stairway as Murphy struggles toward the

top.

EXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS - DAY

Epps swims as the ship sinks in the distance.

INT. CHIMERA - PROMENADE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

A river of water rushes through as Murphy crosses with

difficulty.

EXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS - DAY

Epps reaches the jagged rock of the island. She pulls herself

up.

EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

Water rushes in as Murphy wades out onto the Chimera's top

deck. He is heavily weighted down and periodically goes under

as he half wades half swims, the length of the ship's aft

portion rising above him as the bow sinks.

EXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS -  DAY

Epps collapses on the rocks.

EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY

As the ship moves lower, Murphy pushes off. He bobs under

momentarily, then comes back up with difficulty. The forward

smoke stack has dipped under and is now taking on water, the

current from the rushing water pulling him toward it.

EXT. ISLAND - CONTINUOUS -  DAY

Epps looks on as the giant ship angles higher and higher.

EXT. CHIMERA - WITH MURPHY - CONTINUOUS - DAY

As the ship dips lower, the rushing water forms an eddy that

pulls at Murphy. Murphy struggles, too heavy to resist as he

is pulled closer and closer to the sucking maw that is the

smokestack's opening.

The ship sinks further and Murphy is pulled to the edge of

the stack. He frantically grabs for something to hold on to,

without success, until he is finally pulled into the smoke

stack and sucked into the bowels of the ship by the rushing

water.

EXT. ISLAND - LATER - DAY

Epps sits perched under a rock out of the wind, looking on

at the Chimera, her stern rising high above water as she

goes down, when the RUMBLE OF ENGINES CAN BE HEARD.

She turns to see a Coastguard plane sweeping low over the

Chimera, then banking back and flying right over as she shouts

and waves her arms.

EXT. ISLAND - LATER - DAY

The Coastguard plane flies by one more time, this time

dropping a survival pack.

The Chimera's stern rises up out of the water, almost vertical

now, slipping further and further under.

Epps looks on one last time, as the ship goes down.

EXT. OCEAN - WITH CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY

The afterdeck of the Chimera sinks slowly, slowly down, the

CAMERA PUSHING IN TO "CHIMERA" as the name comes to the water,

then slips slowly beneath the surface. And THE CAMERA FOLLOWS,

MOVING INTO THE WATER to reveal that, beneath the surface,

there is no ship at all, only the vast empty depths of the

ocean.

FADE TO BLACK
