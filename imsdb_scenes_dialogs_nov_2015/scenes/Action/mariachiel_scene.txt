EXT. A JAIL IN MEXICO - DAY

It's an early Friday morning and a patrol car drives up an

unpaved road and parks next to a gutted police car on cinder

blocks. The camera pans with the OFFICER as he exits his car

and walks up to a ramp leading to the babay blue JAIL HOUSE.

He is carrying a greasy bag of fast food.

INT. JAIL LOBBY - DAY

The Officer enters the lobby, tosses the bag of food to his

PARTNER who is sitting at a desk. He grabs a tin cup and

walks over to barred entrance to Block A. Twenty or so

CRIMINALS, from drunks to drug dealers are sleeping

peacefully in their cell on Block A. The Officer rattles the

tin cup between the entrance bar.

INT. JAIL CELLS - DAY

The inmates stir, rubbing their dirty faces and trying to sit

up. The camera dollies slowly down the narrow hallway of the

block which has three cells: Two small ones side by side, and

one bigger cell that faces the block entrance. The sound of

scribbling and business dealing can be heard from inside the

cell. It is AZUL jottin ginto a business ledger while

chatting on his cellular phone. His cell is equipped with a

small desk and a refridgerator. He hangs up the phone and

continues writing.

INT. JAIL LOBBY - DAY

The Officer with the tin cup sits in a couch across from his

partner, who is now eating, and reads a magazine.

INT. JAIL CELLS - DAY

Azul picks up his phone and makes another call. He talks

business. In the other cell, prisoners are getting up and

looking around. Azul hangs up the phone and writes.

EXT. EL MOCO'S RANCH - DAY

A gorgeous, bikini-clad BABE struts slowly into a tighly

framed glamour shot. She pauses, takes a deep breath, then

dives a 'perfect ten' dive into a house-side moat. She swims

long, slow motion strokes around the moat as the camera

tracks alonside her, lovingly admiring her tan lines and

hydrodynamic build. She slides out of the water and walks up

a cobble stone walk, dripping as she passes a seated

GENTLEMAN in a white suit. His face is unrevealed. As she

enters the house, he sets his drink down by a phone. He lifts

up the receiver and dials.

INT. JAIL CELLS - DAY

Azul's phone rings. He looks up at it, startled, as if no one

has ever called him before. He glances at his watch, and then

back at the phone, hesitating to answer it. He looks around

the cell block as if someone might be playing a trick on him.

Finally he answers it, pausing before saying hello. It is El

Moco.

EXT. EL MOCO'S RANCH - DAY

MOCO is sitting on his porch drinking tequila.

CONTINUED:

Azul is walking towards his window at the sound of a truck

racing in.

EXT. JAIL - DAY

A large truck drives up to the jail, parking beside the

police car. Two tall, well-dressed MEN step out. They reach

into the cab and pull out machine guns. They walk briskly

towards the jail.

INT. AZUL IN JAIL CELL - DAY

Azul walks to his toilet and stands on it to see out his

barred window.

There is no response from Moco.

INT. JAIL - DAY

The Guard reading the magazine stands when he sees someone

approaching the door.

EXT. JAIL - DAY

Close tracking shot of guns as Tall Men open the door and

enter the jail.

INT. AZUL IN JAIL CELL - DAY

Azul looks out of the jail cell suspiciously. Peering down

the hall, he sees the guys with the guns. He hides behind the

wall, peering out to see what happens next.

INT. JAIL LOBBY - DAY

The Tall Men walk right up to the guard, and hand him a huge

wad of money. The Guard tosses the money to his partner

(still eating), then turns to unlock the block entrance bars.

INT. AZUL IN JAIL CELL - DAY

Azul puts the receiver back up to his mouth.

EXT. EL MOCO'S RANCH - DAY

Moco, glancing at his watch, hangs up.

INT. AZUL IN JAIL CELL - DAY

Azul hangs up the phone and kicks his Bodyguard awake. The

Bodyguard gets up and peers out the bars as Azul hides in a

corner.

INT. TALL MEN IN HALL - DAY

The Tall Men walk steady and alert, ready to kill. They enter

Azul's block and scope out the cells.

The Bodyguard, seeing the tall men, retrieves his shotgun

from under his mattress and grabs his machete from under the

sink. He stands ready to fight.

The Tall Men move slowly towards the big cell, somewhat

cautious. They see the Bodyguard a second too late, for he

sticks the shotgun between the bars, and shoots one of them

before they can react. The shot one stumbles back into his

buddy's arms. Azul's Bodyguard, amused by all this, opens his

cell door effortlessly, and walks out as if to greet them.

The Tall Men hear the sound of the other cells opening, so

they turn around. The other prisoners on the block begin

exiting their cells, carrying guns and Molotov cocktails. The

Tall Man drops his gun. Finally, Azul exits his cell carrying

his phone. The Bodyguard forces the Tall Men into an empty

cell, closing and locking the door.

Azul presses the #-button on his phone. Moco's phone number

is automatically redialed.

Moco answers.

CONTINUED:

INT. TALL MEN IN CELL - DAY

The cellmates throw their Molotov cocktails into the cell.

Moco hears the men screaming as they burn to death. Azul is

holding the phone at arm's length into the cell.

INT. JAIL LOBBY - DAY

The Guards exchange glances when they hear the screaming,

they smile and shrug, then go back to what they were doing.

As Azul and his Bodyguards exit the block, the Guard with the

magazine stands up as if to stop them, but Azul tosses him a

wad of money and the guard sits back down to count it.

EXT. JAIL - DAY

A blue truck races towards the jail.

Azul exits the jail carrying a shotgun. His Bodyguards get

inside the Tall Men's truck and start it. Azul waits

patiently for his blue truck.

As the blue truck pulls up, two little rat-like VATOS exit

the blue truck, one handing Azul a guitar case. Azul tosses

it onto the hood. The Bodyguards wave as they drive away.

Azul waves back. He opens the case, revealing an arsenal of

weaponry. Azul notices one piece is missing. One Rat quickly

pulls the missing weapon from his jacket and replaces it in

the case. Azul is unamused. He grabs his MAC-10 machine gun

from the guitar case and aims it at the thieving Rat's head.

Suddenly, the Guard bolts out the jail waving the wad of

money, as if complaining.

Azul turns his MAC-10 onto the Guard instead. A few blasts

later Azul and his rats pack up and go as the Guard twitches

helplessly on the ground, still clutching the money in his

bloody hand.

CREDIT SEQUENCE EXT. AZUL / MARIACHI ON HIGHWAY - DAY

The blue truck barels down the highway and the camera pans

with the truck as it passes a hitchhiker, MARIACHI, standing

in the sun with a thumb in the air.

CONTINUED:

The truck    passes him up so he continues walking. Mariachi is

carrying    a guitar case in one hand and a black jacket in the

other. He    is wearing a white T-shirt, black pants. The camera

pans to a    sign that reads "ACUNA 18 miles".

EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

Mariachi is walking around downtown Acuna. He notices a bar

across the street and, liking the way it looks, he puts on

his jacket and crosses over to it. He stops to read a sign on

the building that says "MEMBERS AND NON-MEMBERS ONLY". He

prays silently to himself before confidently walking inside.

INT. CORONA CLUB - DAY

Mariachi enters the club, greeting the PATRONS    as ge makes

his way to the bar. No one seems to greet him    back. He sits

on a barstool near some OTHER DRINKERS, laying    his guitar

case down lovingly beneath his stool. He looks    around the

place, as if sizing it up.

The other drinkers stare at him.

Glancing around the room, Mariachi notices a small, table-

shaped object draped with a cloth in one corner of the room.

Sitting directly behind him are four mean-looking dudes.

Mariachi is served his drink.

CONTINUED:

Mariachi gives him a silent "what" look.

The BARTENDER motions to a YOUNG MAN sitting near the small

draped table.

The Young Man removes the drape revealing a keyboard. Puts on

his mariachi hat, dips his fingers into his shot glass and

rubs his fingers together (as if warming up for the big

show). He hits a few switches in EXTREME CLOSEUP as...

... Mariachi adjusts himself to the seat.

The Young Men gently taps one switch and the keyboard sounds

like an accordion, pulsing out a beat. He then presses

another switch and a horn section swells to a crescendo and

waltzes the familiar riffs. He adds the string and horns

accents by banging on the keys. He sounds awful.

Mariachi grimaces slightly then turns back to the Bartender

who seems to enjoy it.

The Keyboard Mariachi finishes his song, sits back down.

Mariachi picks up his guitar and lays some money next to his

full drink. He looks disappointed.

CONTINUED: (2)

The Bartender picks up the bottle of soda pop Mariachis left

behind and offers it to the other men on the table. They say

no, pay, and leave. The Bartender offers it to the MEAN DUDES

at the table.

They all shake their heads no.

The Bartender shrugs and dumps it.

EXT. CORONA CLUB - DAY

Mariachi walks out and looks up and down the street. He

decides to walk south.

As he walks down the sidewalk, the camera pans into a CLOSEUP

of another guitar case that is moving towards the Corona

Club. The camera falls back a little revealing the backside

of Azul, dressed also in black. Azul walks into the bar.

INT. CORONA CLUB - DAY

Azul enters the bar, notices to his left the table with the

four mean-looking Dudes, drinking and eating chips and salsa.

The oldest one, with his back to Azul, takes a sip from his

mixed drink, then stands and excuses himself to the restroom.

INT. BATHROOM - OLD MEAN DUDE - DAY

The Old Mean Dude walks into the first stall and sits down.

INT. CORONA CLUB - AZUL - DAY

The three remaining Dudes notice Azul's guitar case. So does

the Bartender. They all look at each other and laugh.

Azul walks the mean Dude's table. Their laughing quiets down

a bit as Azul stands before them. The Bartender stops

smiling.

CONTINUED:

The Bartender nods and grabs a frosty glass. He begins to

fill up at the tap.

Bartender stops filling the beer, stares at the half-full

glass for a moment, then drinks the beer.

Azul is staring at the three Mean Dudes. They stare back.

The Bartender slaps the unopened bottle down at the counter.

Azul doesn't pay attention to him.

MAIN MEAN DUDE

You can sometimes find him here. He owns this place.

MAIN MEAN DUDE

We work for him.

Azul turns to the mean Dude sitting to his left, and places

the guitar in his hands. The Mean Dude is confused.

Azul opens the case and pulls out the MAC-10. The other two

Mean Dudes are already reaching for their pistols.

The Bartender ducks beneath the counter.

Azul fires a million bullets into two of the Mean Dudes, (the

other is holding the case in shock). Their chests explode,

causing neat little dollops of flesh and blood fly

everywhere.

CONTINUED:

The Mean Dude holding the guitar case is frozen with fear. He

manages to look up at Azul, who is watching the Mean Dudes

die a slow, bloody death. The barrel of the MAC-10 is

smoking. Azul turns slowly to the Mean Dude holding the case.

Azul aims his MAC-10 in the Dude's face. Still frozen holding

the case, he spends his last moments looking down the gun's

barrel.

INT. BATHROOM - DAY

The shots caused Old Mean Dude to peer out from his stall as

the toilet paper fell to the ground and started to roll

across the floor. He now watches it roll as more shots ring

out. He pulls up his pants and and walks toward the door

slowly. He is sweating profusely. He slowly picks up the

toilet paper, plotting his next move. It grows silent... He

takes a deep breath and rushes out the door.

INT. CORONA CLUB MAIN ROOM - DAY

The Old Dude bursts into the room with a roll of toilet paper

in his hand, and a sheet of sweat sliding down his face.

The Bartender rises up from behind the counter.

The camera dollies slowly by the dead Dudes. Their blood-

bathed faces twisted into odd shapes and expressions. The

camera continues to dolly to the one dead Dude still holding

the guitar case. His face is a bloody pulp. The camera stops

dollying to the old Dude's mixed drink. A hand is stirring it

with a straw. The camera pans up the arm to reveal Azul,

standing expressionless with his gun sling over his shoulder.

Shot at 16fps the Old Dude quickly drops the toilet paper and

runs back inside the bathroom.

Azul turns to his guitar case and carefully chooses another

weapon. He grabs the drink and tosses a napkin over his arm

like a waiter, then casually follows the Old Dude into the

bathroom.

The Bartenders glance at each other. One pours a shot glass

full of tequila and raises it to his lips to drink it. Shots

ring out and the Bartender spills the drink over himself.

Without warning Azul bursts from the bathroom and walks

calmly to his case. He replaces the weapon, picks up the case

and leaves.

A few seconds pass before the bartender grabs the phone and

furiously dials.

CONTINUED:

The door bursts open as Azul reenters, storming to the bar.

The Bartender is so petrified he doesn't think to drop the

phone.

Azul walks right up to the Bartender.

The Bartender shuts his eyes. The sound of the beer bottle

popping open canbe heard, along with the sound of thirsty

guzzling. The Bartender opens his eyes to Azul.

CLOSEUP of the empty bottle slamming to the counter.

The Bartender glances down at the bottle.

Moco is on the porch trying to get the Bartender to answer

him.

WHAT'S GOING ON OVER THERE, ANSWER ME!!!

Mean Dude #5 grabs the phone and dials Moco's number. He

glances down at the PIT BULL lying on the floor.

MEAN DUDE #5

Pit bull?

The line is picked up and Mean Dude talks into the phone. He

pulls out a piece of paper from his coat pocket and places it

on the counter. He begins jotting down four names. He then

slowly crosses their names out.

The Viejo Clerk glances up from his paper. The Pit Bull also

glances up.

Clerk goes back to reading his paper. Pit Bull is still

paying attention, though.

view, but no one is looking at him.

Mean Dude writes down a phone number and the description of

away. The old man reads the card, then glances out the

window. Mariachi is gone.

asks for a refresco, He gets looks again. Domino serves him

and he asks to see the owner. She says he's looking at the

owner. He then asks her for work as a mariachi. She says she

has no money to pay him. He looks arund the classy joint and

knows she's lying (it turns out to be true, she has no

money). When he asks how a girl can take care of herself in a

town like this she stuffs a gun barrel in his mouth. He

nurses his jaw, pays and leaves, as the others laugh.

As Mariachi walks away, the Clerk notices the guitar case and

black clothes and he rereads the card Mean Dude left him.

Mariachi stops in his tracks. He turns back to the Clerk

slowly... thinking.

The dog is watching the event.

The Clerk deposits the money, slams the register shut, and

continues reading his yellow paper. Confused, Mariachi

pockets his empty wallet and turns to find his room.

CONTINUED: (2)

Mariachi goes. He hears the sound of Mariachi's footsteps

trailing off. The old man drops the paper and bolts silently

to the phone as he dials El Moco's phone number...

Mariachi opens his room, tosses his guitar onto the bed and

hangs his jacket in the closet. He has only his white T-shirt

underneath. He glances above the bed to a plaque bearing a

seconds later he drops back and lays there a minute before

kicking the door shut. He tries to sleep.

laugh as they ready to shoot him. Mariachi, though, already

having built momentum, runs right up the front of the trucks

granting him permission to take it. She cleans his glass, and

when he is gone she slams the glass down and runs for the

stairs. A few seconds later she comes back into the bar,

grabs the gun from under the counter and calls her assistant

to watch the bar. He sees the gun and wonders what she's up

to. She storms upstairs.

INT. DOMINO'S LOFT - DAY

Domino opens the door abruptly and finds Mariachi taking a

bath. He bolts upright, pulls a towel up from the floor and

sits frozen waiting for Domino's next move. She laughs and

walks to the counter.

Domino turns to a counter and her smile fades. She looks like

she wants to rip Mariachi's throat out with her teeth. She

puts the gun down on the counter. She finds an omnious-

looking knife and then grabs a bottle of shampoo. She walks

over to him, then pulls the knife up to his throat with one

hand while grabbing his hair with the other. He opens his

eyes wide. The shampoo hits the floor and begins to roll.

CONTINUED:

The shampoo bottle rolls into the guitar case and stops.

Domino sees this, and with her foot reaches out and pulls the

case toward her.

Mariachi tries to catch his breath, pausing before answering

her as if wondering if all this is really happening.

Domino slides her foot out of her shoe, and unsnaps one of

the latches with her toe.

She unsnaps another. The latches snap loud and echo in the

quiet room. Mariachi gasps as she tightens her grip.

She squeezes his hair and unsnaps another latch.

Another latch snaps.

SNAP!

SNAP!

She lifts the lid with her foot. It seems an eternity before

the case is fully open. Domino is looking into the case, but

Mariachi is not. He knows what's in there.

CONTINUED:

Slow dolly into the case, which contains a white, well-kept

classical guitar. Domino is seeing it, and for a moment she

almost believes he is telling the truth.

She rushes to it, grabs the guitar and tosses it to Mariachi.

He catches it, choking after she releases the blade. She is

on the other side of the tub, now. She jams the knife down

between Mariachi's legs. Mariachi's eyes bug.

Domino shoves the knife in deeper and Mariachi grimaces

horribly.

Mariachi is sweating and his face is extremely red. He pauses

for a long time before plucking an odd note. She squints as

if she's caught him. But he eventually starts picking out a

sweet little melody.

SING!

Mariachi starts to sing but chokes on the words. He starts

over, playing a "Rancho Grande" sounding song with his own

made up words.

He finishes his song, bowing and thanking his imaginary

audience. Domino is smiling. She pulls the knife slowly out

of the water and wipes it off on her apron.

CONTINUED:

Mariachi bows a solemn thank you.

CLOSEUP of the knife.

She laughs.

Domino looks at him with a silent "what?".

CONTINUED: (2)

She gets up slowly, and turns to leave. Mariachi settles

back, smiling triumphantly. Suddenly she darts around and

slams the knife between his legs again with a furious look on

her face. He bolts up out of this triumphant daze with a look

of complete shock. She loosens up and laughs.

She flings her knife aside. It sticks into a wall. She

shrugs, smiles a beautiful smile, turns, and goes downstairs.

Mariachi settles back down, closing his eyes. The knife slips

out of the wall and clangs to the ground. Mariachi jumps

again, rolls his eyes, and sinks underwater as the picture

fades.

INT. AMADEUS - EVENING

Mariachi plays in Amadeus.

INT. AZUL'S HIDEOUT - DAY

Camera tracks past a pool table where TWO RATS are playing

nine ball. They make a few shots, then the phone rings. The

camera continues to track past a small table where Azul's

guitar case lies open. Weapons adorn it, with each knife,

each gun in its pocket, in its own place. The camera

continues tracking to a dresser on which sits Azul's cellular

phone. A delicate female hand lifts the receiver. The camera

is now positioned above the bed as the GIRL answers the

phone.

He rolls over and wakes a GIRL sleeping beside her. Girl #2

takes the phone and passes it to a third GIRL as Girl #2

tries to wake Azul (he is sleeping between Girls #2 and #3.).

Girl #3 has the phone to her ear as if listening for

background conversation.

The two Rats playing pool are staring longingly at the three

Girls in Azul's bed. They look hungry and deprived. One hits

the other, signaling it's his shot. While one shoots, the

other watches.

Azul awakens and grabs the phone.

jumps in his seat, then after a few frozen seconds he sets

down his paper and reaches for Mariachi's old room key.

Mariachi shakes his head "no", points to the register, and

makes the money sign with his hand. The Clerk slowly moves

over to the register. He depresses a few keys to open it. It

won't open. He makes a gesture like it's stuck or something

(he is not very convincing). He tries again and again; each

time pretending to get more impatient.Mariachi glances down

at the Pit Bull. The Pit Bull is eyeing Mariachi.

CONTINUED:

Mariachi points to the Clerk as if he has an inside joke with

the dog ("this guy..."). Mariachi climbs over the counter and

stands next to the Clerk. The Clerk things Mariachi is a

lunatic. Mariachi holds up a finger as if cueing the Clerk

for a demonstration. Mariachi then leaps over the counter

landing firmly back on the other side of the counter.

CLOSEUP of his feet landing hard, just as before.

The register opens. Mariachi shrugs, smiles, and reaches into

the register, taking his money out himself. He counts it.

After a brief consideration, he decides to leave the old man

a tip. Mariachi waves a "good-bye" wave and dances out. The

old man, still standing there with his arms outstretched as

if he was robbed, dashes to the phone and calls Moco's men.
