The CAMERA SWOOSHES down to CHEV'S FOOT as he STEPS ON THE

UP... the BEATING SPEEDS UP -

SOUND: ... LUBDUB, LUBDUB, LUBDUB..!

... and the CAMERA SNAPS back out to CHEV'S FACE as he seems

to come to his senses.

CHEV takes the cell. One-clicks, and sticks the phone in the

CHEV begins to fade again. He slumps back, looking as though

he might pass out. One of the BROTHERS catches him, holds

him up and shoves him away.

He takes pity on him - CHEV really looks like shit. A few of

the BROTHERS lose interest, begin to filter out of the room.

ORLANDO gives him the look.

CHEV shoves his gun into his belt, pulls out a wad of tens,

tosses it into the sink. He's visibly fading.

ORLANDO takes a quick look over the wad, pulls a little

plastic bag out of his vest pocket, tosses it to CHEV. The

bag hits CHEV square in the forehead, hits sweat and STICKS.

CHEV reaches for it lamely - it slides off and lands on the

floor. His reflexes are not the best at this point.

CHEV collapses to his knees, breaks it open and snorts it

right out of the bag like a pig on his elbows and knees. The

BROTHERS find this hilarious.

ORLANDO shakes his head in disgust.

We hear CHEV'S heart rate start to build, increase in volume.

Suddenly he pops up to his feet, almost slips and falls,

steadies himself. A new man.

CHEV pounds rhythmically on chest, keeping time with his

beating heart.

Abruptly, CHEV'S HEART STOPS... his eyes go wide - he waits

for it...

... and then it STARTS UP AGAIN, slow, erratic. CHEV is GHOST

CHEV swoons, close to BLACKING OUT.

CHEV SNAPS to his senses.

The DOCS, in all the confusion, haven't noticed CHEV yet.

backs up past the DOCS toward the elevator just as the chime

GANGSTER   on each side, one of them holding out a smoking,

silenced   GLOCK .9mm.

More ASIAN GANGSTERS appear all around, moving in, taking

position. The GANGSTERS all look about 16 years old, dressed

for a hot night at the FLORENTINE GARDENS... but their eyes

are dead-blank COLD AS HELL.

One of CARLITO'S GOONS points an UZI at DON KIM... and is

FILLED FULL OF LEAD in the blink of an eye by a pair of

INT SMOKING LOUNGE, STANDARD HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

CARLITO'S and DON KIM'S MEN have backed into opposite corners

of the room, and are firing back and forth.

VERONA crawls along the floor, gathering up what's left of

his fingers... comes across a SYRINGE and grabs it in his

teeth like a PIRATE'S KNIFE.

DON KIM stands amidst the chaos, completely unperturbed.

CHEV swoons, almost passes out... catches sight of a GUN and

pries it from the hand of a dead GOON... he spots VERONA'S

FEET disappearing behind a wall, takes a bead and fires -

blowing off a set of toes to go with the fingers.

An ASIAN GANGSTER runs up and lobs a GRENADE behind the

BAR... it bounces along and comes to rest next to CARLITO.

CARLITO thinks quick, grabbing one of his GOONS - a 265

pounder - from behind...

He BODY-TACKLES the BIG MAN onto the floor, right on top of

the live grenade, and brings his weight down on top of him.

BOOM!

The BIG GOON'S body absorbs the blast, which picks them both

up five feet in the air... CARLITO, momentarily airborne,

pops up from behind the bar like a JACK IN THE BOX, then

drops back down with a THUD...

The LOUNGE opens into a daylight drenched POOL AREA...

CARLITO'S HELICOPTER drops down into view, roiling up the
