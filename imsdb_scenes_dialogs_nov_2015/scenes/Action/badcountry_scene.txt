FADE IN:

LANDSCAPES

A rusted Chevy El Camino drives against dissolving Louisiana

landscapes - broad, barren, pounded by the rain.

I/E. EL CAMINO, TRAVELING - DUSK

Occasional oncoming headlights illuminate the driver's face:

Tense, course features, thick beard... He's BUD CARTER, 31.

AN INTERSTATE SIGN PASSES ON THE RIGHT: "WHISKEY BAY"

Bud pulls onto a dirt road, into a TRAILER PARK and stops.

INT. DOUBLE-WIDE TRAILER - DUSK

TITLE IN: Denham Springs, Louisiana. 1983.

We're staring at three sacks of sample unmounted EMERALDS,

set on a filthy counter.

WIDEN to reveal NADY GRACE, 35. A tattooed man with thinning

hair, leading Bud through the sale...

ACROSS THE ROOM are two other men -- JAKE and DOUG. Ex-cons

at a table, riffing through Bud's cash.

A CURTAIN YANKS BACK and RAY WHEELER, 29, enters. Dope-thin,

bloodshot eyes. He looks at Bud. Bud looks at him... Ray

clicks on the TV and opens a beer.

TV IN: Evening news. The storm outside alters the reception.

Bud watches Ray empty a gram of coke onto the bar. Using a

credit card, Ray starts chopping lines. The SOUND continues

throughout the scene...

Grace hefts a lock box to the counter, removes a drawer of

emeralds. Bud SEES packed carelessly underneath, uncut

DIAMONDS.

And the volume of the TV now becomes more apparent...

Bud has been tuning out the TV distraction... until that last

statement. He sneaks a look.

A wave of static scrambles the picture. When it clears...

Bud is stunned. HIS OWN FACE APPEARS ON THE SCREEN. A younger

photo of Bud, clean shaven - DRESSED IN POLICE UNIFORM.

EXT. TRAILER PARK - SAME

Rain pours. A beat-up PLUMBER'S VAN is parked in the distance.

INT. GRACE'S TRAILER - SAME

TV IN: Signal wavers. It's archive footage of Baton Rouge

Airport. A prisoner, JEFFREY DOUCETT, escorted by police.

Ray does a line of coke, keeps chopping. Watches the TV.

Grace is bagging emeralds.

Jake and Doug count cash.

Bud keeps the TV in sight. Quick glances. Mind racing.

TV IN: The procession moves past a row of pay phones. At one

phone, a discreet figure, GARY PLAUCHE, turns...

Bud's vision is suddenly obscured when Grace steps forward

with the emeralds in a satchel.

Sudden GUNSHOTS and SCREAMS on the TV. Everyone turns...

TV IN: Jeffrey Doucett lies dead as POLICE wrestle Gary

Plauche to the ground amid chaos.

TIGHT ON RAY'S EYES, intense, watching the footage.

As Bud stuffs the satchel in his coat, WE SEE what Ray

sees...

TV IN: Bud, POLICE BADGE AROUND HIS NECK, arresting Plauche.

ON RAY, slow burn realization as he looks from the tv to Bud.

And again. EYES LOCK, THEY BOTH KNOW.

Bud yanks a .45.

And everything happens at once.

A SUDDEN GUNSHOT and Jake FIRES again.

Wood splinters as Bud FIRES back.

Jake is HIT in the throat. A SECOND SHOT in the forehead - he

SLAMS against the window, cracking it...

INT. PLUMBER'S VAN - SAME

Among surveillance equipment, sits Bud's crew: TODD SHEPARD,

DAVID MARANDINO and DALE COBB.

Gunshots ECHO.

Marandino, behind the wheel, SLAMS his foot on the gas.

INT. GRACE'S TRAILER - SAME

A SHOT ZIPS across Bud's back; he SPINS off the table.

On his knees, Doug is firing a .32. BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM.

Bud FIRES a burst through Doug's chest, dropping him.

A HOLE EXPLODES beside Bud's head -- Grace FIRING a .45 -- as

Ray SCREAMS and runs out the door.

EXT. TRAILER PARK, VAN - SAME

Marandino winds through gears, as Ray hits the yard

running...

POV THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD: Marandino swings the wheel hard,

SLAMS INTO RAY -- launching him through trash bins, into the

mud.

Cobb jumps from the van and pounds Ray into handcuffs.

Simultaneously, Shepard sprints for the trailer door...

EXT. GRACE'S TRAILER PARK - SAME

Grace explodes from the back door, bolting across the yard.

I/E. GRACE'S TRAILER - SAME

Bud scrambles on the floor of the demolished trailer. .45

held tight, he runs out after Grace.

ACROSS THE YARD

the chase rages.

MOVING WITH GRACE

as he jumps a link fence, lands and trips into a roll of

chicken wire. His sleeve catches, rips as he pulls free...

MOVING WITH BUD

at a searing pace. He slips in the mud. Staggers up. SEES

Grace disappear in the shadows.

Grace throws himself against the side of a power unit. Eyes

darting. Wheezing hard... Tries to slow his breath. Then

turns the corner...

GRACE'S POV: A SHOVEL swings from around the corner, WHAM!!!

The blow sends Grace sailing back. He SLAMS on the ground,

with a blood-covered broken face. As he tries to get up...

Bud's gun is there. And like that, it stops.

INT. SOUTHDOWN'S BAR - AFTER HOURS

At a table, the METRO SQUAD: Bud, Shepard, Marandino, Cobb

are drinking. A bartender (SHERRY) is wiping down glasses...

Bud blows smoke, distant from the others.

Sherry arrives with shots of whiskey, moves on.

Bud takes his shot.

EXT. EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH JAIL - ESTABLISH - NEXT DAY

A dark, stone monolith off the 110 highway.

INT. OBSERVATION ROOM, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH JAIL - DAY

Bud smokes, standing with Shepard in semi-darkness. They're

looking through a two-way mirror into an INTERROGATION ROOM,

where Cobb interviews Ray Wheeler.

Bud paces to a neighboring INTERROGATION ROOM where Marandino

is questioning Grace (bruised face, swollen, broken nose).

Bud, sipping coffee, paces back to Ray's interview...

Bud sets down his coffee, calm.

INT. GRACE'S INTERROGATION ROOM

Marandino sits across from Grace, clearly frustrated.

The door blasts open. Bud charges in, throws Grace against

the wall, then slams his face onto the table, pushing down.

Bud twists his broken nose. Grace SCREAMS.

Marandino puts a hand on Bud's shoulder; Bud shoves him off.

Marandino locks it. Bud turns Grace's nose even harder,

nearly rips it off his face.

Grace, spitting blood now. Choking. Bud twists. Bone cracks.

EXT. CLAYTON STREET - NIGHT

Raining.

An unmarked chevy is staked down the block from a tract home.

INT. CHEVY - NIGHT

Bud's in the front seat, looking through a file. Shepard at

the wheel. Coffee cups and junk food litter the dash.

Through the windshield, across the street, a tract home

they're watching.

Bud likes it.

Night passes and the dawn arrives...

EXT. WHEELER'S HOUSE - DAWN

Front door opens and the shadowy figure of JESSE WHEELER,

whose face we cannot see, emerges.

Jesse fires up his '74 battered green PICK-UP TRUCK. He backs

from the driveway and proceeds down the street.

Bud's car starts and we move off with them...

EXT. STREETS - MINUTES LATER

In the rain, Bud and Shepard tail Jesse from a distance.

They pass an alley where a waiting BUICK falls in behind the

Chevy; Marandino and Cobb are inside.

INT. CHEVY - CONTINUOUS - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD:

We see the truck slowing, angling into a TEXACO STATION.

INT. JESSE'S PICK UP - MOMENTS LATER

Jesse stops at a pump. Suddenly, Bud appears at the window

and jams a SHOTGUN against Jesse's head.

Reflecting in the side-view: Bud's BADGE swings from his

neck. Jesse's eyes resign to relief. Bud SEES this...

With several law enforcement shotguns now leveled at him from

all directions, Jesse turns off his engine.

EXT. JESSE WHEELER'S HOUSE - MORNING

Bud, Shepard, Cobb and Marandino, vests and shotguns, move in

unison around the house.

Bud and Cobb stay to the shadows, down a side yard...

Shepard, Marandino reach the front door. Locked. A tv plays

quietly inside. No one in the windows.

Shepard signals to Marandino...

INT. JESSE WHEELER'S HOUSE

THE FRONT DOOR IS KICKED DOWN. Shepard and Marandino spill

in, guns ready...

A pregnant woman in the kitchen... LYNN WHEELER, 30s. She

SCREAMS, curses. Hurling dirty dishes fly like frisbees.

Lynn suddenly gasps agitatedly, sinks to the floor. A GUSH OF

FLUID soaks through her dress.

Bud and Cobb enter from a back door, hurry towards Lynn. Bud

lowers Lynn to the floor.

BEDROOM - TIME CUT

A door slams open to reveal...

A NAZI IRON EAGLE BATTLE FLAG. Draped across the far wall.

Windows taped over. Walls painted black.

Military surplus on every shelf and surface. Helmets.

Uniforms. Body armor. Bayonets.

Bud in the doorway. Shepard joins him.

Several COPS(now on scene) ransack the house. Ripping open

cabinets, drawers, tossing everything to the floor...

GARAGE

Cobb flips a switch. A lamp illuminates a workbench.

Cabinets, lockers and tool boxes slam open. Cops stop cold,

blown away by what they see: GUNS. Everywhere.

LIVING ROOM

COP #1 feels behind a couch. He finds a .38, then a COLT .25

below a chair cushion.

BATHROOM

COP #2 removes the toilet's basin cover. With a pen, he

removes a dripping .357.

KITCHEN

Several STATE TROOPERS lead Jesse in, cuff him to a table.

ATTIC

Floor peels back. Flashlights illuminate: AMMUNITION BOXES.

ASSAULT RIFLES. GRENADES. BONDS and COUNTERFEIT PLATES.

LIVING ROOM

Cops talk excitedly over one another. Shepard leans over a

mounted A.C. He finds a string and very slowly pulls up a

ziploc bag filled with DIAMONDS.

KITCHEN

Bud takes a seat at the table...

For the first time, we get a good look at Jesse Wheeler: Cold

eyes. Handlebar mustache. Covered in tats. With a

boilermaker's build, he looks what he is... DANGEROUS.

Jesse's stare drifts to Bud. It's deadly.

Cabinets slam open and closed. Dishes hit the floor.

COP #3 is searching the refrigerator. Jesse watches as if

he's seen something we haven't... Cop #3 moves on...

Jesse sees Bud's eyes. They connect with his own...

Bud opens the fridge. He scans condiments then stops. From

inside a bag of HOT DOG BUNS, several sealed VIALS.

Bud examines a vial's label: "CYANIDE."

Bud, right with him, grins.

Jesse, calm. Deadpan.

Bud looks in Jesse's eyes and believes it.

BEDROOM

Shepard, searching the room. Drawers, cabinets. Then leans

down to peer under the bed...

...stops, stunned when he SEES: a row of live Goex charges in

packing, boldly marked: EXPLOSIVES

INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRECINCT - DAY

MIKE BRADDOCK (40s), Captain of Detectives, enters his

office. Bud tows, carrying files.

INT. PROCESSING ROOM, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - DAY

ON A CAMERA FLASH. Mug shots of Jesse's front and profile.

Jesse's inked fingers are rolled onto an exemplar sheet.

INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRECINCT - DAY

Bud slaps a file on Braddock's desk, to a crime scene photo:

An Asian JUDGE sits dead in the front seat of his car.

The crime photo: A black MINISTER and wife shot in bed.

INT. ANTE ROOM, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - DAY

A nude Jesse steps before a DOCTOR and gets a cursory exam.

INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRECINCT - DAY

Meanwhile...

Braddock listens. Bud keeps it on track...

Braddock smiles slightly.

Braddock, thinks; Then--

Bud grins, SLAMS his hand on the desk.

INT. HOLDING AREA, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - DUSK

Two GUARDS escort Jesse. He's bound in chains, orange scrubs.

INT. HOLDING CELL

End of the hall. A BLACK PRISONER waits, arms slung over the

crossbars with a cigarette. Jesse is brought forth.

A Guard unlocks the cell. The Black Prisoner steps back,

joining TWO OTHERS: All black, looming in the darkness.

Jesse steps in. Guards unlock his shackles. Chains hit the

floor. Behind him, the bars slam home.

SILENCE...LONG, DRAWN SILENCE. THEN:

A MOMENT. Cued by Jesse's challenge, each of the prisoners

slowly rise, vehemently approaching...

INT. BUD'S HOUSE - NIGHT

And the phone RINGS...

WIDEN. Bud's house is sparsely furnished. Books on firearms

and police work in stacks. As he reaches for a file...

INT. OFFICE, MARION PENITENTIARY, ILLINOIS - NIGHT

CHARLIE BOWERS, on an official phone. At Jesse's name, he's

DEAD QUIET...

INT. BEDROOM, BUD'S HOUSE - PRE DAWN

Bud lies in bed, wide awake. The PHONE CONVERSATION carries

over...

KITCHEN - DAWN

Coffee pours into a mug. Then a shot of Irish Whiskey.

Bud, dressed now. The table is covered with various reports

and photos from Jesse's file. BUD'S EYES guide us through...

Bud picks up a photo: Jesse's Angola mug shot, age 23.

Photos of Jesse's tattoos: SUN-WHEEL on the shoulder; HELL

HOUNDS around the biceps, THOR'S ELAPID covering his back.

INT. BUD'S CAR, TRAVELING - MORNING

Bud's face goes in and out of light and shadow.

INT. LOWER FLOOR, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - MORNING

Bud is walking with MURPHY, captain of the guards...

Bud and Murphy descend steps to a grim CORRIDOR.

The PHONE CONVERSATION fades out... Presently:

Murphy stops outside a solid steel door.

INT. ISOLATION CELL - CONTINUOUS

Bud enters. Murphy shuts the door and a series of locks BOLT.

We're in a stone closet. No bed or sink. No light.

Jesse's bruised face moves through shadow.

Jesse's eyes emerge from the dark. Bud, looking right at him.

Bud smiles and walks to the door.

HOLD on Jesse.

Bud BANGS on the door. Locks UNLATCH. The door opens and Bud

steps calmly out to the hall...

The door shuts with a BOOM, locking Jesse in. And the nail in

the coffin resonates.

EXT. GREYHOUND STATION - LATE NIGHT

Dim and desolate.

INT. LOBBY, GREYHOUND STATION - LATE NIGHT

Grace buys a ticket, crosses the lobby to the men's room.

INT. MEN'S ROOM

Grace at the sink. He pats running water on his damaged face

and straightens the bandage.

A TOILET FLUSHES

the stall door opens and a man emerges. Lean and fierce, like

an electric charge... CATFISH STANTON, 30.

Grace FREEZES at the sight of Catfish, tightening his belt.

Lets the water run...

Catfish steps close, reaches a hand to Grace's face.

Grace flinches. Catfish pauses, then SNIFFS his hand.

Catfish steps to the sink. Begins washing his hands.

Another MAN suddenly enters. Large and imposing, neck tattoos

...BUZZ MCKINNON, 32.

Catfish turns off the water. THE BATHROOM IS SUFFOCATED WITH

SILENCE.

Catfish GRINS. It's harsh. Blood curdling.

Buzz moves. Grace turns to look...

...In a blink, Catfish's gun comes up: ONE QUICK POP. A .45

with a thick, barrel silencer. The mirror shatters. Grace's

knees hit the floor. His head hits the sink, HOLDS. As blood

runs from one small hole.

Catfish straightens up in the next mirror. Tucks his shirt.

Grace's body sags to the floor. Catfish and Buzz walk out.

INT. EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - DAY

LOUD BUZZER. Two GUARDS #1 and #2 march Jesse down the tier.

On his left, PRISONERS in cells, TURN, STARE and WHISPER.

Jesse arrives at a cell.

BARS slide back. Jesse walks in. His CELL-MATE steps

cautiously from the shadows...

IT'S RAY. Pale and nervous. Jesse stands over him. The

brothers' eyes connect. And there's a moment...

EXT. EXERCISE YARD, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - DAY

High stone walls topped with concertina wire. Looming guard

towers. Thick FOG blankets the yard filled with CONVICTS.

Jesse takes hold of a metal bar, lifts it from a bench press.

He does two reps. The weights BANG down and Jesse sits up.

Ray adds weight to the already excessive amount. He sweats as

he talks nervously over Jesse's shoulder...

Jesse scans numerous WHITE CONS watching the Wheeler brothers.

Ray fastens the safety collars and Jesse leans back.

Jesse does another set. Weights BANG down. He slowly sits up.

Ray shoots a look at a group of ARYAN BROTHERS across the

yard. CZAPP, their "leader," and ROACH. Jesse turns. Czapp

looks at him. Eyes meet. Jesse leans back.

The press shakes as Jesse does a last set. His red strained

face as the bar lands with a CRASH.

INT. YARD CORRIDOR, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - DAY,

LATER

A long line of prisoners are filing back through the gate.

Ray, behind Jesse. Says low:

Ray swallows hard. Nothing he can say.

INT. METRO OFFICE, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRECINCT - DAY

CLOSE ON numerous files of ARYAN GANG MEMBERS. Arrest sheets,

paperwork and photos.

REVEAL NOW Bud and Shepard with Cobb and Marandino around a

table, used as a converted eating area.

Shepard is flipping through a worn, thick file.

He opens the file, revealing mugshots of LUCIAN ADAMS, 51.

Dark eyes. Sharp, gun metal features.

Shepard pulls an old, faded surveillance photo: (Long shot)

Lucian talking to a young Jesse outside a compound.

Bud's been quiet; says now:

Marandino does.

Everyone looks to Bud.

INT. CAFETERIA, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - EVENING

A sea of tables divided by race as far as the eye can see.

Jesse and Ray, trays in hand, find an island of ARYAN

PRISONERS. They quickly part to make room for Jesse to sit.

Suddenly Czapp and Roach arrive with their trays and abruptly

sit across from the Wheeler brothers.

Czapp locks on Jesse, who calmly eats, not looking up.

Ray nervously glances down at several Aryans watching...

Czapp looks away from Jesse and shouts down the table:

Suddenly Jesse SPRINGS. A headbutt EXPLODES Czapp's nose and

throws him back.

Czapp's head hits linoleum, echoing with a CRACK!! He lies

still. Bloodied and unconscious.

A DEAFENING SILENCE SPREADS OVER THE CAFETERIA.

Jesse calmly resumes eating. Czapp's blood covers his face.

SUDDENLY AN ALARM BLARES. GUARDS pour in, led by Murphy.

INMATES HIT THE DECK, arms behind their heads. All except

Jesse, who continues to eat.

Jesse rises.

Jesse puts his hands behind his head, but does not kneel.

Restraints are slammed on Jesse's wrists. And we...

INT. ISOLATION, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - LATE NIGHT

The door unlocks and drags open. Jesse turns, blinking

painfully into the light ...Sees an imposing DUTY GUARD.

INT. GUARD STATION

Jesse is led in. Duty Guard hits an extension button on a

desk phone and offers the receiver...

Jesse doesn't move.

Duty Guard walks out. Alone now, Jesse picks up the line...

A low, whiskey voice is HEARD over the line: LUCIAN ADAMS.

Jesse shuts his eyes. There's a moment before he opens them.

Jesse turns SLOW to find the Duty Guard watching him from the

hall. Lights a cigarette, stares.

And Jesse's quiet... Dead quiet...

Jesse hesitates, then Lucian hangs up. DIAL TONE.

INT. BRADDOCK'S OFFICE - LATE NIGHT

Room strewn with piles of casework. Bud, agitated, paces.

Braddock, behind a desk.

Bud pours himself a cup of coffee.

INT. VISITOR'S GATE, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - DAY

Lynn, dark pouches under her eyes, goes through security

check. INFANT SON in her arms.

VISITING AREA

Wives, girlfriends and lawyers talk to prisoners.

TABLE

Lynn, dark pouches under her eyes, holding their son, across

from Jesse...

Lynn's hands are shaking.

Jesse is silent.

The baby begins to CRY.

The baby WAILING now.

TIGHT ON JESSE, for the first time, appearing powerless.

As Lynn wipes tears, trembling in her seat, Jesse looks away

from his son, and glances up...

Behind a glass partition outlying the room, a MAN is watching

them...

BUD. Stark still. Fixing Jesse with a hard stare.

INT. PROPERTY ROOM, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - LATER

A CLERK passes Lynn her belongings through chain link. She

wipes her eyes, holding the baby.

The back bay doors open. Bud enters. Sleepless, wrinkled

clothes.

Bud peels a few bills from a fold, puts it on the counter.

Bud lays his card atop the bills, looks at Lynn.

They look at each other. She pulls her baby close. There's an

unspoken moment. And Bud walks away...

Lynn waits till Bud is out of view. Then takes the money. And

the card.

INT. CELLBLOCK, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - DAY

A Guard buzzes Jesse through.

PRISONERS line the tier. Smoking cigarettes. Looking out.

Jesse walks past, enters...

HIS CELL

...where Ray sleeps in shadow on the bottom bunk.

Jesse pulls a Polaroid from his pocket: His infant son. He

gazes at the photo for a beat, then brings it to Ray...

No response. Jesse nudges his brother's shoulder.

Jesse rolls him over. Ray is limp. A filthy SYRINGE imbedded

his arm. Jaw slack. Eyes wide and vacant.

THE PHOTO FLUTTERS FROM JESSE'S HAND TO THE FLOOR...

Jesse lowers, pulling Ray to his arms. He shuts his eyes.

Teeth clench. And as Jesse feels the bile rising, his massive

frame begins to shake... Then we realize, he's crying...

EXT. LOADING DOCK, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON - DUSK

Pouring rain. Ray's corpse is loaded onto an ambulance.

INT. JESSE'S CELL - DUSK

Jesse sits in shadow. Alone. And it's still...

AFTER HOURS

Jesse sleeps. Hand under the pillow. When there's a sound...

His eyes SNAP OPEN to discover the silhouettes of SIX MEN,

rushing into his cell...

A LOADED SOCK swings out from Jesse's pillow, slams MAN #1 in

the jaw with a CRACK!!

On his feet, Jesse whips the sock around and whacks MAN #2's

head against the concrete wall. He slumps down unconscious.

A BLUNT OBJECT is rammed into Jesse's sternum. Another shot

bangs his neck. The sock drops and a PADLOCK clatters out.

With a final burst of energy, Jesse turns, SCREAMS and rushes

MAN #3. Man #3 slams into the cell bars. CLANG!! Lights out.

The remaining three Men attack. A series of blows rain down

and Jesse sinks into their grip.

HALL LIGHTS BUMP ON: NOW WE SEE, THESE "MEN" ARE GUARDS.

More GUARDS pour in, led by Murphy. They yank Jesse from his

cell and take him down the tier.

Guards toss the cell in a thorough search. Mattress

overturns. Shelves crash.

INT. TIER

PRISONERS move to their bars, SHOUTING and JEERING as Jesse

is wrestled down the STAIRS to...

THE LOWER TIER

Jesse thrashes violently as the Guards slam him through a

door into...

A TUNNEL

between cell blocks. The ROAR of prisoners recedes as Jesse's

dragged into darkness getting darker.

A DOOR SLAMS OPEN...

INT. READY ROOM, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRISON

...THERE'S A FLASH OF LIGHT. We're in a windowless room.

And Bud pouring coffee for two...

Jesse is handcuffed to the table. Guards are breathing hard.

Jesse pauses, caught by Bud's tactics. The Guards file out

and shut the door.

Jesse's eyes are fierce and watching Bud's every movement as

he hands him a coffee, then takes a seat...

Jesse's face is tense. Unyielding.

Jesse silent, a dark internal pause. He meets Bud's eyes

across the table; then...

Jesse's sudden directness has caught Bud off-guard.

And Jesse begins to consciously or unconsciously "preach."

Beat. Jesse, taken back.

Bud flips open a file and shoves a series of grainy B&W

SURVEILLANCE PHOTOS in front of Jesse.

Photo #1: Outside Jesse's House. A distressed Lynn and the

baby being led into a car by Catfish.

Photo #2: Tight-shot of Catfish.

Photo #3: An anonymous duplex. Catfish escorting Lynn and the

baby inside, past several surly Aryans looking on.

Jesse finally averts his eyes...

ON JESSE. The wheels turning. Burning. THE CAMERA MOVES IN...

And that's where it hangs...

FADE IN:

INT. COURTROOM, BATON ROUGE - DAY

Jesse rises, wearing a suit. JUDGE PONDER, at the bench,

presides over this arraignment hearing:

CUT TO DANIEL KIERSEY, 40s, sharp, confident, expensively

dressed. Jesse's attorney, rising:

The DISTRICT ATTORNEY rises from his seat:

CUT TO Judge Ponder:

THE GAVEL BANGS DOWN. Kiersey shakes Jesse's hand. Smiles:

REVEAL BUD -- seated in back, watching the proceedings.

INT. BEDROOM, JESSE'S HOUSE - PRE DAWN

Lynn, asleep in bed...

INT. HALLWAY

Jesse stands, holding his son, quietly comforting him. When

Jesse turns, WE SEE a .45 tucked in his back.

AND THE PHONE RINGS...

STATIC; he listens, then:

EXT. BACKYARD, JESSE'S HOUSE - PRE DAWN

Jesse steps through his fence into deep WOODS, to find a CAR

waiting idyll on a dirt road.

INT. CAR - PRE DAWN

A HEAVY-SET MAN at the wheel. Jesse gets in as the headlights

spin on and the car pulls away...

EXT. SHIPYARD - PRE DAWN

Dark. Eerie and desolate. The car arrives. Jesse steps out

and disappears into the shadows of a towering crane.

On the jetty, a nondescript MAN stands alone against the calm

Mississippi. His back is to us.

Jesse approaches, stands quietly beside him.

We realize now...It's Bud.

They stand together, facing the liquid horizon...

Bud finally looks at Jesse.

EXT. BORROW PITS - DAWN

A swamp area used as a mud retrieval source for the levy.

Amite River. FOG OBSCURES NEARLY EVERYTHING.

Jesse slowly emerges... Then Bud and Metro, on all sides, MAG-

LIGHTS, FLAK JACKETS and SHOTGUNS. A DUFFEL BAG of SHOVELS.

The sounds of the swamp are terrifying. Herons and bobcats.

Boots hitting water. The buzz of a million mosquitos.

SUDDENLY A RUSHING SOUND -- An ALLIGATOR shoves off the mire.

Cobb's light catches the tail whipping into the swamp.

Jesse suddenly STOPS. LISTENS. BREATHES. Bud and Metro stare.

Metro exchanges looks, ANXIOUS. Bud nods "okay".

EXT. JESSE'S BORROW PIT

Metro engulfed in fog. Picks and shovels rise and fall.

Bud excitedly descends the pit to scrape gravel from metal.

Jesse watches as a pair of STEEL DRUMS emerge.

INT. STATE POLICE AUTOPSY ROOM - MID MORNING

The "cold room". Bud and Braddock watch as two PATHOLOGISTS

hose down the drums. The stench is horrible.

BLOW TORCHES ROAR as Pathologists burn through the drums.

Sparks fly. The lids CRASH. Swamp water floods out... And

immersed within: two sore-covered, DECOMPOSING BODIES.

The room recoils from the fumes.

INT. KITCHEN, JESSE'S HOUSE - DAY

Lynn is putting dishes away. The baby nearby, sleeps quietly

in a swing. Lynn gazes out the window...

EXT. DRIVEWAY, JESSE'S HOUSE

Jesse is under the hood of his truck, fixing the engine...

When a '71 Mustang, white-on-white, roars up the street.

Jesse glances over as the car pulls alongside the driveway.

It's CATFISH, at the wheel. A wolfish grin.

Jesse tightens a nut with a torque wrench, says nothing.

Jesse EYES his .45 atop the engine block, within reach.

Jesse stays on the engine, never turns around.

As Catfish drives away... We HEAR a series of photos being

taken at high-speed. FREEZE FRAME to BLACK & WHITE.

PULL BACK to a distant CONSTRUCTION TRAILER. Bud with a long

lens camera, triggers snapshots.

INT. DINER - DAY

Greasy spoon, soul food joint. Trucker and labor patrons.

Bud walks in, perplexed to find Braddock sitting with

MARTIN FITCH (30), Deputy Chief of Staff for US Attorney

General. Pressed suit. Young face. Out of his element.

Fitch offers his hand, smiles. Bud shakes.

Bud looks at Braddock.

Fitch's smile drops as Bud stares him down.

Bud blinks.

Bud stares at Fitch.

A WAITRESS in her 50s approaches.

Bud's chair SCRAPES back as he stands, stares hard at Fitch:

And walks out.

EXT. PARKING LOT OUTSIDE DINER - DAY

Bud stalks out to his car. Braddock follows, agitated. They

say nothing till they reach the car.

Bud unlocks the car. They stand, talking across the roof.

Braddock walks away. Bud simmers a moment, gets in his car.

INT. A ROOM - FOLLOWING MORNING

A bare room; nothing to tell us where we are. Jesse's on a

stool. He runs his fingers down his mustache, grits his teeth.

REVERSE: We're in a HOTEL SUITE.

Shades down. Full of AGENTS: FBI, ATF, DEA, SECRET SERVICE.

Law enforcement everywhere. On the furniture, against the

wall, sitting on the floor. Staring at Jesse in silence.

Bud stands by the door with Braddock. And Fitch steps

forward, laughs nervously...

An ATF AGENT #1 imposes:

ARGUING ENSUES, Agents' voices step over one another. Fitch

tries to take control. Jesse's been silent, until...

Fitch hears this. He turns, loudly to the room...

And EVERYTHING stops. Fitch moves to Jesse:

FBI #2 approaches Jesse...

Everyone is suddenly interested. Bud sees this.

Agents part, revealing JOHN NOKES(50s), black, an emminent

figurehead in a plush suit. Surprised to be pointed out...

It's quiet. Nokes thinks. Then LAUGHS and approaches Jesse.

Jesse is explosive under the low projection delivery and a

CHILL falls over the room.

Bud simply nods.

Jesse stares at Nokes. As the meeting settles back to a

comfortable level...

The room erupts with LAUGHTER. Everyone except Bud and Jesse.

EXT. GRAND COUTEAU - DAY

Jesse's truck moves over an old wooden bridge through

sweeping fields that stretch to a vast, wooded area.

EXT. FRONT GATES, PRIVATE PROPERTY - DAY

Jesse stops at a long drive protected by locked iron gates.

A surveillance camera zooms in. Jesse looks up. A second

camera pans on Jesse, staring...

MOVE IN as crackling, electronic pixels FILL THE FRAME and...

INT. GUARD STATION - SAME

A BANK OF MONITORS showing Jesse at the gates. A GUARD sits

in shadow, hits a button: We see the gates unlock and open.

INT. JESSE'S TRUCK

pulls down the private road.

Shafts of light mottle then burst, REVEALING an elegant

VICTORIAN HOME.

Jesse parks -- walks up the porch, where Catfish is relaxing,

shoulder holster, revolver. And Buzz, cleaning a pistol.

Jesse nods, eyes Catfish.

Catfish grinds out his cigarette, gets to his feet.

INT. LUCIAN ADAMS' OFFICE - DAY

CLOSE ON: A SNIFTER

as Louis XIII pours to the rim. From elsewhere in the room:

THE VOICE belongs to RICHARD MORRIS, 40s. He sits in a

leather chair, facing Lucian Adams, who's face we cannot see.

Seated next to Morris, is Daniel Kiersey.

LUCIAN'S HAND lifts the cognac out of frame, drinks.

Morris goes suddenly silent, looks across at Lucian.

Morris stares across the desk, several tense moments. Then:

INT. LIVING ROOM, LUCIAN ADAMS' HOUSE - DAY

Morris emerges from the office. He glances at Jesse, then

shrugs on his coat and leaves...

Jesse looks back at the office doorway. FOLLOW Jesse in...

INT. LUCIAN ADAM'S OFFICE

...past Kiersey, behind a massive desk in this impeccable

room, we finally SEE LUCIAN ADAMS.

Jesse is not invited to sit.

Kiersey walks out and shuts the door...

ON LUCIAN

he crosses slowly to a credenza, selects a clean shirt.

As he removes the shirt he's wearing, REVEAL tattoos: BLACK

SUN on his back. GERMAN RUNES, SS BOLTS, HRUNGNIR'S HEART.

And around his stomach, a belt of NORSE GODS with the words,

"INVISIBLE EMPIRE." Prison tats, dark and aged.

Lucian, no emotion, puts on a pressed dress shirt, fastens

cuff-links.

Lucian checks his hair.

And Lucian finally turns; looks at Jesse, eyes measuring...

Jesse smiles slightly. They know each other well...

...When Lucian's smile suddenly drops. There's a flash of

controlled anger across his face; and WE FEEL a curtain of

tension fall heavily on the room.

Jesse he pulls from his pocket, a tiny pouch. Sets it on the

desk...

He pours the contents into Lucian's palm: DIAMONDS and

EMERALDS.

Lucian approaches the desk, opens the pouch: DIAMONDS and

EMERALDS... A slow smile spreads across his face.

Lucian embraces Jesse. Tight. Then, softly in his ear:

As they part, their eyes meet. Something passes between

them...

I/E. JESSE'S TRUCK, TRAVELING - BACK ROAD - NIGHT

Jesse at the wheel, glances nervously in the rearview. Lynn

in the passenger seat, baby in her lap. They're driving under

the cover of darkness...

EXT. PRIVATE AIRSTRIP - NIGHT

Marandino looks through BINOCULARS: As an electric fence

slides back. Jesse's truck approaches, drives through.

EXT. RUNWAY - NIGHT

A twin-engine PLANE idylls. Lines of blue lights, strobe like

rivers, air traffic above... And Bud, leaning against a

nearby car with Shepard and Cobb.

Jesse helps Lynn and the baby from his truck. Together, they

walk toward the plane...

Bud, watching from a distance, nods to Lynn.

OUTSIDE THE PLANE

Jesse and Lynn stare at each other. She's crying as he pulls

her close, one arm around the baby. He says something to them

we cannot hear...

Then with the baby, Lynn boards her plane. An AGENT shuts the

door. The engine SCREAMS to life, taking off...

Jesse turns to shield his face. Lights STROBE and BLAST...

Then, ABRUPT DARKNESS AND SILENCE...

ON JESSE

now alone on the tarmac. Bud approaches; then...

INT. JEWELRY STORE BASEMENT - NIGHT

Several AB SOLDIERS stand watch as Jesse pushes a heavy, 10"

drill through a jeweler's vault door... Jesse throws tumbler

and relock mechanisms aside, reaches in... jewels, gems.

EXT. PARKING LOT - BETWEEN CARS - NIGHT

Bud and Jesse parked next to each other, trading info.

E/I. VARIOUS HIDEOUTS - NIGHT

AB counterfeiting bills... Printing press and metal plates...

Hands stain bills with coffee grounds and cigarettes, then

industrial dryers... Jesse at a table behind tall stacks of

cash, inspecting, approving...

INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE - NIGHT

Bud with Jesse. Info, names and written amounts.

INSERTS: HANDS file serial numbers off guns... HANDS building

silencers... loading guns in suitcases below false bottoms...

EXT. PAY PHONES - NIGHT

Jesse on the line... Bud on the other end, taking notes...

INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

AB Soldiers unload crates from trucks, "Chrysler Corp."...

"Remington Firearms"... Antique furniture... Machinery...

INSERT: A MONEY MACHINE counts large denominations of cash.

EXT. BELOW AN OVERPASS - NIGHT

Parked under the interstate. Bud looks over Jesse's info.

EXT. NEW ORLEANS PORT - NIGHT

A large fishing boat arrives. Numerous Fisherman load marlin

onto refrigerated trucks... Catfish, Buzz, numerous AB start

up the trucks... Jesse hands the Head Fisherman a canvas bag

of cash...

PULL BACK to reveal Shepard, Cobb and Marandino on the roof

of a neighboring port, snapping photos. Taking notes.

E/I. ISOLATED BARN - NIGHT

Trucks arrive. AB bring the marlin inside... Atop a crate,

Jesse slices a marlin open, revealing kilos of cocaine. More

marlins are cut. More cocaine.

INT. METRO OFFICE - DAY

Bud on the typewriter, hammering out Jesse's contacts and

movements. Files piling on his desk.

INT. METRO OFFICE - NIGHT

An organizational chart, as Bud pins AB mug shots, arrest

sheets and surveillance photos wall to wall.

Bud steps back, observes. His case building. Getting huge.

EXT. BACK PATIO, LUCIAN'S HOUSE - DAY

Wood secluded. Lucian, Jesse and Kiersey sit around a table.

Lucian lights a cigar, smoke curls from his lips.

EXT. LUCIAN'S BACK YARD - LATER

Jesse and Lucian walk together through green, expansive

countryside. A pair of Arabian mares graze nearby.

Lucian looks at Jesse, who feels Lucian's scrutiny.

EXT. HENDERSON INDUSTRIAL ZONE - ESTABLISH - NIGHT

Dark, factory skyline. Burnt out cars sit before a WAREHOUSE.

INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

HEADQUARTERS for the Baton Rouge operation. A beehive of

government activity. TECHNICIANS listen to tapes... PHONES

ring off the hook... Bud and Fitch going over the case:

Fitch, annoyed, but staying on track.

Bud, cooling his heels. As the phones RING and RING...

A violent rainfall.

AERIAL SHOT swooping along the HIGHWAY, then rising above the

deep woods to reveal a TRUCK STOP ahead.

EXT. TRUCK STOP - NIGHT

Closed for construction. A VAN arrives. A blinking barricade

is pulled back, allowing entrance...

Generators light the scene: A group of SHIITE MUSLIMS wait by

a pair of idle FREIGHT TRUCKS. A crew of five AB SOLDIERS

exit the van: Jesse, Catfish and Buzz among them.

EXT. LUMBER STORAGE, TRUCK STOP - NIGHT

The door to one Freight truck rolls to the top, revealing a

converted ASSAULT WEAPONRY SHOWCASE.

Below covered scaffolding, both crews stand. Guns bulge

through their coats. No talking. No sudden movement.

Shiites watch Jesse and Catfish examine the merchandise: SEMI

AUTOMATICS, SHOTGUNS, CARBINES, SUB-MACHINE GUNS...

Everyone looks at each other. Jesse acknowledges worth.

Catfish pulls a large CANVAS BAG from the van, filled with

cash. As he carries it toward a bench, a large Shiite (OMAR)

reaches for the bag before Catfish can set it down...

...Both men hold tight. Neither letting go. And there's a

moment.

Catfish and Omar are eye-to-eye. Then, Catfish lets go with a

smile:

The Shiite leader, NASEEM, sees the strife.

Omar hands the bag to Naseem. The count starts. Both crews

watch closely...

...All except Catfish, fixated on Omar, who stares back.

The count stops. Naseem looks to Omar. Questions in Arabic go

back and forth. The pressure getting to the group...

Everyone reaches for their guns. Threats SHOUTED in Arabic

and English.

SUDDENLY ARC LIGHTS BEHIND A DISTANT BARRIER IGNITE, flooding

the scene. Everyone turns.

Omar reaches for the bag of cash...

BLAM! Catfish FIRES, point blank, shooting Omar in the face.

And World War III erupts.

AB's FIRE. Shiites RETURN FIRE. From several stakeout

locations, ATF AGENTS deploy and OPEN FIRE.

Jesse is grazed in the shoulder, slips, staggers-runs.

SHIITE #1 FIRES THREE SHOT BURSTS at AB #1, who's blown

apart. A generator and ATF #1 collapse.

ATF #2 and #3 with pump shotguns OPEN UP on the AB's van.

Naseem, over a Mercedes roof, FIRES A BURST at ATF, then

swings onto AB #2 and FIRES, killing him. Naseem jumps into

the Mercedes, yells at the DRIVER to go.

Buzz RAPID FIRES, hits Shiite #1 in the back. Shiite #1 is

spun around and Buzz shoots him in the head.

Catfish FIRES into the lot... Hitting SHIITE #2.

IN THE MERCEDES, Driver floors it. ATF re-emerges, kneels and

PUMPS SHOTS into the Mercedes.

Jesse has taken off, past the lumber storage. Catfish and

Buzz follow, breaking for the Freight truck.

IN THE MERCEDES, Driver is blown apart by ATF. The car

CRASHES into a dumpster, knocking Naseem out.

Jesse, Catfish and Buzz jump into the Freight. ATF FIRES.

WINDOWS EXPLODE. SHIITE #3, trying to climb in is shot down.

Jesse, behind the wheel... BURNS rubber pulling out of the

stop, over and through a scaffold, collapsing it.

The Freight truck draws everyone's FIRE. Jesse pilots it

through the CHAOS. Scaffold DRAGGING behind. Sparks fly.

JESSE'S POV: Where he's going. An opening in the

construction, leads back to the HIGHWAY and ONCOMING TRAFFIC.

ATF CARS speeds in, the opposite way...

AS THE VEHICLES PASS: JESSE AND ATF

lock eyes. And the Freight makes the highway, scattering

traffic, to the sound of ongoing GUNFIRE...

EXT. DESOLATE FIELD - LATE NIGHT

The moon hangs low as Jesse parks the Freight truck among

tall grass, where a vacant BREAD TRUCK is waiting.

As Catfish exits the truck...

...Jesse takes Catfish's gun, grabs him by the neck and SLAMS

him against the cab. FACE TO FACE.

Buzz grabs at Jesse; Jesse HURLS him to the ground.

Jesse slams him back again. HOLDS his throat.

PAUSE. Catfish glares, then concedes.

Jesse starts moving crates from the Freight onto the bread

truck. Catfish and Buzz watch for a moment, then join.

INT. FBI WAREHOUSE - LATE NIGHT

Televisions broadcast news coverage of the shoot-out. AGENTS

work, uncomfortable, as Bud and Fitch argue. Explosive...

Braddock suddenly arrives, steps into the room...

And Bud's taken off stride. Braddock looks Bud right in the

eyes, so there's no doubt...

Bud, red with anger, walks out.

Braddock watches him go. Fitch comes over, relieved...

Braddock pours a cup of coffee.

A big mistake. Now Braddock turns on Fitch, zeroing in...

INT. STEEL MILL - PRE DAWN

STEELWORKERS warped in heat waves swing ingots into troughs.

The seven story furnace is deafening.

ENTRY AREA

Lucian is met by Kiersey. They walk together through glassed

in hallways to a closed office door.

Lucian keys in, REVEALING a disheveled Morris seated in a

chair with two large AB Soldiers on either side.

INT. STEEL MILL OFFICE - PRE DAWN

Lucian shuts the door and sits before an ill at ease Morris.

Morris swallows hard as Lucian stares intensely.

Morris gets stone quiet. Lucian hands him a phone.

And like that, this conversation is over.

EXT. LIQUOR STORE + PHONE BOOTH - DAWN

Off a deserted street. A DENSE FOG resides, far as the eye

can see. And Jesse, in a PHONE BOOTH, drops a dime and

dials...

SILENCE for a moment...then a quiet baby's voice.

Emotion rises to Jesse's face. He holds it in, barely.

ANGLE: DOWN THE STREET

a lone CAR is parked in the shadows, fog rolling past...

...Jesse sees it, can't see who's inside it.

He hangs up.

A LONG MOMENT... Jesse stands there, watching the car... He

slowly makes his way toward the back of the store, where his

truck is parked. Pulse pounding, he tries the door...it's

locked. Eyeing the car, he unlocks his truck.

THERE'S SUDDEN MOVEMENT. Jesse spins. And out of the darkness

-- steps Bud -- ready to pounce...

Jesse STARES -- a malevolence in his eyes that freezes Bud to

the spot. Then, Jesse climbs in his truck and drives off.

INT. BRADDOCK'S OFFICE, EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRECINCT -

DAWN

Bud pacing; Braddock sits at his desk.

INT. OFFICE, STEEL MILL - DAY

Morris (a nervous wreck, unshaven) sits across from Lucian.

Kiersey at an adjacent table.

Morris opens his briefcase and hands over a pair of dossiers.

Lucian puts on his reading glasses, opens a dossier.

Lucian peruses surveillance photos: Images of AB activity

goes by in a blur. Lucian's eyes absorbing, rigid, unerring.

Kiersey, foraging through reports. Page after page. Each

minutely detailed.

ON LUCIAN. Thinking...Thinking...

INT. JESSE'S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT

Jesse, alone in the dark, seated on the couch... There's a

SOUND outside...

Jesse moves soundlessly through the house, gun ready, toward

the back door.

JESSE'S POV: as the door opens slow, HE/WE SEE ON THE PORCH:

LUCIAN

seated comfortably in a chair...

Jesse looks to the darkness. Dogwood trees. Thick growth.

EERIE SILENCE...

Jesse's silent. YOU CAN CUT THE TENSION WITH A KNIFE...

Lucian sets a photo on the table, face down with an address

written on back.

Jesse flips over the photo: It's Bud, in uniform.

ON JESSE, a frozen moment. He forces out the words:

With that, Lucian gets up and leaves, disappearing into

darkness.

EXT. JESSE'S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT

Jesse climbs into his truck and pulls out to the street...

JESSE'S TRUCK heading up the INTERSTATE, crossing into EAST

BATON ROUGE, then driving through dark RESIDENTIAL STREETS of

Bud's neighborhood...

I/E. JESSE'S TRUCK - LATE NIGHT

He pulls to the curb, parks. Jesse racks a MOSSBERG SG, loads

it with solid shot, then lays the gun on his lap.

THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD: Bud's house in the distance.

And Jesse sits there, several moments...WAITS...BREATHES...

Then he exits the truck...

EXT. BUD'S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT

Jesse moves -- fast, soundless -- toward the house. With his

shotgun, scales the fence, as we--

EXT. DOWN THE STREET, BY JESSE'S TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER

A VAN arrives, stops. No headlights, two hundred yards from

the house. INSIDE THE VAN: Catfish and Buzz. Several AB

SOLDIERS in back, armed to the teeth.

The motor ticks and ticks and...

EXT. SIDE YARD, BUD'S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT

It's dark, quiet; but the muted glow of a tv in the living

room. JESSE MOVES IN SHADOW, shotgun leading... He stops.

LISTENS...

WE HEAR THE SOUND OF HARD WATER FROM A SINK OFF-SCREEN

...Jesse moves toward it...

INT. CATFISH'S VAN - LATE NIGHT

Catfish, Buzz, the soldiers watching Bud's house intently.

Catfish, loading his gun, as--

EXT. YARD, BUD'S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT

Through a window, WE SEE Bud washing dishes. Then, slipping

INTO FRAME...

JESSE

watching him. Pulse pounding, his mind on overdrive, trying

to untangle identity and consequence... Then...

He taps the window, and Bud looks up...

THE BACK DOOR

Bud opens it:

INT. CATFISH'S VAN - LATE NIGHT

Catfish, anxious now, racking his gun again and again.

Catfish, breathing hard, bent on bloodshed...

INT. BUD'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - LATE NIGHT

Bud quickly dials the phone --

QUICK CUTS as Bud hangs up, shoves a .38 in his waistband.

Slams a clip and holsters a 9MM.

Bud and Jesse start for the door...

INT. CATFISH'S VAN - LATE NIGHT

AB Soldiers loading their guns.

CATFISH

starts the engine; POV THRU THE WINDSHIELD: Jesse and Bud,

leaving the house.

EXT. BUD'S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT

Jesse hurries down the lawn. Bud to his Chevy.

SUDDENLY THE SOUND OF TIRES BURN... CATFISH'S VAN SEARS DOWN

THE STREET...

...THE DOOR SLIDES OPEN AS AB SOLDIERS OPEN FIRE FROM SUB

MACHINE GUNS.

Jesse drops behind a neighbor's sedan.

Bud dives behind the Chevy. ROUNDS SLAM through sheet metal,

interior, and out the other end.

AB Soldiers exit the van, spread and keep FIRING. Jesse's

sedan takes hits. WINDOWS AND TIRES EXPLODE.

Bud and Jesse aim over their roofs. Take and RETURN FIRE.

Catfish emerges, kneels and pumps SHOTS into Bud's Chevy.

The WINDSHIELD is BLOWN APART -- Shattered glass covers Bud.

INT. SHEPARD'S CAR, TRAVELING - LATE NIGHT

Shepard at the wheel. We hear dispatch on the police scanner:

Shepard hits the BRAKES, peels a hard U-turn and SLAMS the

gas toward Bud's house...

EXT. BUD'S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT

Buzz rounds the van and OPENS FIRE.

Jesse and Bud cover. Their eyes connect. Bud signals towards

the house. Jesse nods...

...then lays cover fire with the Mossberg. AB #3 is spun and

thrown.

Bud, under fire and firing back, races back into the house.

Jesse keeps FIRING.

I/E. BUD'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Bud YANKS an M-16 from the closet and slams the door.

OUTSIDE

Jesse, on his knees, pulls a secondary .45 from his waistband

and fires over the hood of the sedan.

CATFISH FIRES HIS SHOTGUN AND JESSE'S HAND EXPLODES IN HALF.

Jesse hits the dirt, WRIST PUMPING BLOOD.

AB #4 and #5 move in for the kill, when out of nowhere --

SHEPARD'S CAR SPEEDS ON SCENE -- His door kicks out; SHEPARD

PUMPS SHOTS, EXCHANGING.

Buzz comes up from behind, aims -- BULLETS FLASH AND PUNCH

THROUGH SHEPARD.

INSIDE THE HOUSE

Bud swings the M-16 through the glass and BLASTS AWAY,

killing AB #4, as Jesse staggers toward the house, holding

his wrist...

...and DIVES inside, then kicks the door shut.

EXT. BUD'S HOUSE - SAME

Catfish, Buzz and AB Soldiers flank the house.

INT. BUD'S HOUSE - SAME

On the floor, Jesse rips out his belt, a tourniquet around

the armpit. He holds it with his teeth and ties his arm.

Bud reloads and slides Jesse a .357 Python. Jesse takes it up

with his good hand.

Suddenly in the darkness beyond, MUZZLE FLASHES DISCHARGE.

THREE TRIPLE-AUGHT ROUNDS EXPLODE. Bud ducks, scrambles, as

rounds splinter the wall.

A BACK KITCHEN DOOR is bashed open and AB #5 steps in,

BLAZING SHOTS.

Bud lets fly -- FIRING. Big bore rounds punch through AB #5.

His insides hit the wall.

WE NOW HEAR DISTANT POLICE SIRENS APPROACHING...

EXT. BUD'S HOUSE + STREET - SAME

A LONG-HAIRED AB on the lawn fires dozens of shots from an

M-1.

Catfish and Bud exchange CROSSFIRE as...

...Buzz starts up the van and Catfish jumps in, followed by

Long-Hair...

I/E. BUD'S HOUSE + STREET

Bud runs out to the street, M-16 FIRING at the fleeing van.

Bullets shatter the back window as the van speeds around the

corner through garbage cans and a residential fence...

ON BUD

standing there. He turns, and STOPS when he SEES...

SHEPARD

inert, bullet-ridden.

Bud holds his partner, horrified. Around them, bodies on the

lawn. Disabled vehicles. Doom overlays the property.

EXT. BUD'S HOUSE - MINUTES LATER

Pandemonium as the street is clogged with POLICE VEHICLES and

MEDIC UNITS. Braddock arrives with Cobb and Marandino.

Bud moves alongside a PARAMEDIC wheeling a gurneyed Jesse,

with a pressure bandage and splint, onto an ambulance.

E/I. LUCIAN'S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - PRE DAWN

A huge BATTERING RAM knocks it right off the hinges. SWAT,

Bud rush in with rifles...

...Room by room. Everyone clears. The house is empty.

E/I. STEEL MILL - PRE DAWN

SWAT TEAMS have secured the premises. Two HELICOPTERS sweep

the grounds via SPOTLIGHT. A manhunt for Lucian Adams.

INSIDE, Cobb on his radio:

INT. LUCIAN'S HOUSE - PRE DAWN

Bud listens on his radios as SWAT OFFICERS file out of the

vacant house.

Bud stands there, infuriated...

INT. TRAUMA CENTER, OUR LADY OF THE LAKE HOSPITAL - DAWN

Jesse, unconscious in bed, with IV lines re-infusing plasma.

Bud is with a DOCTOR, who washes his hands in a sink...

Doctor walks away. Bud turns as a NURSE dims the lights and

pulls the curtains, obscuring Jesse...

I/E. OUR LADY OF THE LAKE HOSPITAL - DAWN

Bud, absorbed, walks past crowded emergency room activity...

OUTSIDE

Braddock is waiting.

Bud says nothing.

Bud, hearing it. Feeling every bit of it.

Braddock walks off. Bud watches him go.

INT. SQUAD CAR, TRAVELING - DAWN

Bud drives in dark silence. As the hospital recedes, Bud

pulls a flask from his coat, takes a drink...

FADE IN:

Sunlight rises through a gap in the dark sky.

EXT. CEMETARY - MORNING - DAYS LATER

SHEPARD'S FUNERAL. UNIFORMED POLICEMEN saluting as a PRIEST

gives the eulogy.

BUD

at the gravesite, with Braddock, Cobb and Marandino. A salute

is FIRED with rifles.

LATER

Bud stands alone. Dry-eyed, vacant stare.

EXT. EAST BATON ROUGE STREETS - DAY

Flashbulbs burst rapid-fire as coroner crews and police

secure a crime scene: Richard Morris sits dead at the wheel

of his car, a plastic bag over his head filled with blood.

IN THE FOREGROUND, lit by police lights, is Bud and Cobb.

Cobb proffers Morris' wallet. Bud sifts through cards --

Several businesses, out of state -- Then stops cold at one:

"Daniel J. Kiersey, Attorney at Law"

Braddock arrives on scene. Disturbed expression:

INT. SUBACUTE CARE, REHABILITATION WARD - AFTERNOON

A PARTITIONER bandages Jesse's swollen and stitched hand. Two

fingers and thumb remain.

There's a KNOCK O.S.

Jesse looks up to see Bud enter from the hallway.

Partitioner exits. Jesse, raw nerves raked. Looks to Bud.

EXT. GROCERY STORE - AUSTIN, TEXAS - DAY - FLASHBACK

Lynn emerges from the grocery, looking sad and prematurely

aged. Her baby in the cart, tucked between bags of food.

FBI #3 (TOM) helps Lynn and the baby into an Unmarked Car.

INT. FBI UNMARKED CAR, TRAVELING

Lynn sits in back with the baby. Tom, at the wheel.

THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD: FLASHING CONSTRUCTION LIGHTS come

into view. A DETOUR. And a team of LABORERS at work.

INT. SUBACUTE CARE, REHABILITATION WARD - AFTERNOON

Bud stares intently, waits for his cue, can't find it...

INT. FBI UNMARKED CAR - FLASHBACK

LABORER #1 steps INTO FRAME with a STOP SIGN.

A crane moves past, hoisting steel. Tom IDLES the engine.

Then:

Tom drives onward, glancing in the REARVIEW: at Laborer #1

watching them pull away, receding in the distance...

INT. SUBACUTE CARE, REHABILITATION WARD - AFTERNOON

Bud, the pit in his stomach widening, struggles to say:

INT. FBI UNMARKED CAR - FLASHBACK

Tom - calm and alert - looks to his right - SEES a child's

BICYCLE parked on the sidewalk. A BACKPACK affixed to the

handlebars...

EXPLODES

A MASSIVE GOEX BLAST IN TWO DIRECTIONS. HITS THE CAR'S REAR

DOOR, CUTTING STEEL.

WINDSHIELDS OF PARKED CARS SHATTER. NEIGHBORHOOD HOMES. THE

CAR IS BLOWN SIDEWAYS AND WRAPS AROUND A LIGHT POST.

THE CAR'S FRONT DOOR DROPS OPEN AND TOM CRAWLS OUT. CHARRED.

BURNING. LAST GASP OF LIFE.

EXT. ANOTHER RESIDENTIAL STREET - MOMENTS LATER

A CARGO VAN pulls up and parks. The Labor Team abandons it,

dumping gloves and outer clothing into plastic bags,

REVEALING: A CREW OF AB SOLDIERS LEAD BY CATFISH.

The bags go in the back of a waiting SUBURBAN. Catfish takes

the wheel. The crew climbs in, drives away.

INT. SUBACUTE CARE, REHABILITATION WARD - AFTERNOON

ON JESSE. Absorbing this. His face begins to tremble. Eyes

press shut. They fill with moisture as he looks away.

HOLD ON BUD. Quiet. Struggling to hide his own emotion.

And he walks out.

INT. HALLWAY, REHABILITATION WARD

MOVING WITH BUD, as he heads for the exit. Under harsh

fluorescents...

EXT. SOUTHDOWN'S BAR - NIGHT

Pouring rain.

It's a madhouse outside. A crowd is gathered around a police

action in progress. MEDICS are tending to the broken nose of

a bartender (PETE) in his 30s. METRO COP #1 stands by.

A car pulls up and Cobb gets out with Marandino. They

approach the bartender.

Cobb and Marandino approach.

Cobb and Marandino start toward the bar.

INT. SOUTHDOWN'S BAR - NIGHT

The place is A MESS. Chairs broken, tables overturned. Music

BLARES on the jukebox. And empty except Bud... three sheets

to the wind, drunk. Pacing the ruins with his 9MM in hand...

Cobb and Marandino peer in the doorway to see Bud, shouting

and threatening a vacant chair.

Bud flips another table. Continues talking to the chair as if

someone were in it.

Bud holsters his gun and beats the shit out of the chair.

Bud spins, glass-eyed and red-faced. His wavering vision can

barely make out Cobb and Marandino approaching...

Bud stands his ground, tries to keep his balance...

There's a long moment. Bud stares at his crew, gone. Then

he's suddenly overwhelmed with emotion...

INT. REHABILITATION WARD - MORNING

Two FBI AGENTS #4 and #5 walk together down this sterile

corridor. They stop outside Jesse's closed door. A uniformed

POLICE OFFICER is posted there, reading a newspaper.

FBI #4 signs the chart. The two agents enter...

INT. JESSE'S ROOM

Jesse's bed is empty. The window open. Curtains billowing.

FBI #5 opens the bathroom door. Empty. Both Agents hurry to

the window, SEE OUTSIDE: A large TREE six feet out from the

ledge and a broken branch at street level. A seemingly

impossible escape route.

INT. FBI WAREHOUSE - MORNING

A badly hung-over Bud sits with Braddock, Fitch and numerous

agents around a conference table.

NOKES

walks the room, says to all:

Nokes circles behind Bud...

Fitch wipes sweat, swallows hard.

INT. HALLWAY, FEDERAL BUILDING

As everyone files out. Braddock says low to Bud:

ON BUD. Tired eyes. Everything else, and now this...

INT. STORAGE GARAGE - DAY

A metal door rises up. Jesse, in silhouette, steps in.

A BARE BULB comes to light. Mottled with fly excrement.

Jesse unlocks and opens several SAMSONITE SUITCASES. Stacked

in grey packing foam are rows and rows of GUNS.

Jesse hefts his choices. Checking line and breach: A 12 Gauge

Shotgun. A Colt .357 Magnum. A Remington sawed-off with

pistol grip. Les Baer Tactical .45. Glock Semi-auto 9MM. Buck

Knife. Duct tape. 5-Gallon gas cans. He loads up a gym bag.

Jesse pulls scissors from a grooming kit and stands before a

grimy mirror. He cuts off his hair. Then using clippers,

shaves his scalp and mustache.

Jesse yanks a tarp off a '75 beat-up Chrysler. Pops the

trunk. Throws in the gym bag. Then drives away.

EXT. BAYOU GHOULA - NIGHT

A lone, dilapidated HOUSE BOAT sits heavily in the bayou.

Lights on inside. Dense FOG overlays.

INT. HOUSE BOAT - NIGHT

Long-Hair on the couch, watching tv, drinking liquor. SPEED

METAL MUSIC blasts from a stereo somewhere.

There's a METALLIC BANG O.S.

Long-Hair looks up.

The screen door rattles. Long-Hair grabs an aluminum bat,

slowly approaching...

Sudden surprise as the screen SNAPS OFF and a SILHOUETTE

breaks the glass, opens it.

Long-Hair RUSHES for the door as THE BUTT OF A 12-GAUGE SLAMS

DOWN LIKE A TOMAHAWK.

Long-Hair collapses with a shattered knee and muted scream.

Jesse steps in, racking the gauge with one hand, takes aim on

the helpless Long-Hair writhing on the floor.

EXT. HOUSE BOAT - NIGHT

The front lights go out. A terrible darkness.

INT. HALLWAY, HOUSE BOAT - NIGHT

A door flies open. Jesse, eyes darting, pushes Long-Hair in.

Bandaged hand clamped to the collar. Shotgun at the neck.

They move down a dark hallway. SPEED METAL throbs, growing

LOUDER... Long-Hair, gash gushing, leg crunches with each

step... They turn another hallway... Light spills from under

a door, shadows behind it... Jesse edges Long-Hair forward,

reaches the doorway, creeps through...

INT. BEDROOM

The door swings wide on the room, REVEALING: Buzz, on the

bed, furiously fucking a dark-haired HOOKER, over a bureau.

As Long-Hair rounds the corner... Buzz looks up, SEES Jesse.

Dives for a gun. CHROME FLASHES. Everything EXPLODES at once.

The WALL DETONATES and Buzz goes down. Shocked. Choking.

Blood juts from his side. He tries to get up. Can't.

The HOOKER SCREAMS and cowers terrified in the corner.

Jesse pumps, aims through the haze and fires again. Stereo

explodes. MUSIC CUTS OUT, plunging us into silence.

Jesse tosses clothes to the Hooker.

The Hooker does.

INT. BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER

Two chairs. Buzz and Long-Hair back to back. Hands and feet

tied. Blood spigoting. Jesse circles them with the shotgun.

The boat rocks gently.

Buzz, to Jesse, unintimidated:

In one motion, Jesse racks the shotgun, thrusts the barrel to

Long-Hair's chin AND BLOWS HIS HEAD OFF.

Buzz screams, REARS UP, chair collapses beneath him, DRAGGING

a dead Long-Hair along the floor, still tied together.

Jesse YANKS Buzz up. His chair rocks upright, into place.

Jesse punctuates, shotgun butt against Buzz's head. Neck

snaps. Teeth rattle.

Jesse strikes again, connects. Buzz goes down in a heap, eyes

swollen purple slits. His skull gushing red.

Jesse steps over Buzz, pins the shotgun to his jaw.

Jesse shifts his aim an inch, pulls the trigger. SHOT REVERBS

HARD. Buzz SCREAMS, hysteria.

Jesse puts down the shotgun. Pulls from his gym bag, two CANS

OF GASOLINE, one of which, he splashes over Buzz's face.

Jesse pours the rest over Buzz and the lifeless Long-Hair.

As Buzz pleads for his life, Jesse unloads the shotgun, dead

aim...FIRES.

THE MUZZLE FLASH. GASOLINE IGNITES. BUZZ GOES UP IN FLAMES.

Instantly, a FIRE ERUPTS. Buzz and Long-Hair's corpses BURN.

Jesse empties the other can of gas, FEEDING THE FLAMES. THE

FIRE SPREADS. BURNING THE WALLS. THE FLOOR AND CEILING.

Jesse stands there, the heat reflects the intensity in his

face. For a moment, it's a vision in hell.

EXT. HOUSE BOAT, BAYOU GHOULA - PRE DAWN

Engulfed in flames. SIRENS and LIGHTS as FIRE TRUCKS and FIRE

BOATS douse the burning boat with hard water.

Among a crowd of SPECTATORS, the shaken Hooker is being

questioned by Marandino.

Bud and Cobb stand apart.

Bud starts leaving the scene. Suddenly FITCH and two AGENTS

barge forward.

Bud shakes his head in disgust, keeps walking...

Bud storms off.

FADE IN:

EXT. WHISKEY BAY (BLEACH BYPASS) - DAWN - IMAGINATION

Lynn stumbles through the woods, holding her baby. Scared.

Lost. Their skin bleached-out. Eyes hollow. Like apparitions.

We're in a dream. A sadistic enhancement.

JESSE'S EYES

His family's image dissolves inside them.

WIDEN to reveal Jesse before a cracked mirror in a SERVICE

STATION BATHROOM. Perspiring, he re-bandages his hand as

blood swirls down the drain.

INT. CORRIDOR, COURTHOUSE - MORNING

An expensively dressed Kiersey emerges from a courtroom,

flanked by a pair of well dressed AIDES.

The Aides scurry down another corridor, as Kiersey exits the

building through the glass front doors...

INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE - MORNING

Kiersey moves to a parked Cadillac pops the trunk and sets

his briefcase inside, when...

A RUSHING POV FROM BEHIND: Slams the trunk on Kiersey's hands.

Kiersey SCREAMS, drops to his knees. His wrists wedged in the

trunk. And standing over him...is Bud.

Bud kicks him in the stomach, doubles him over.

No answer. Bud pounds on the trunk. Kiersey CRIES OUT.

Bud slams both fists on the trunk. All his weight.

Bud, enraged, kicks Kiersey's ribs in. Again.

Bud opens the trunk. Kiersey crumbles to the ground, shaking.

Bud jams a foot in Kiersey's neck. Grabs his hands and bends.

We HEAR bones snap.

Bud roughly searches Kiersey.

Bud finds a PAGER on Kiersey's slacks, yanks it off. Then

leans down with a smile, venomous:

Bud storms off. Kiersey on the ground, a trembling mess.

INT. CATFISH'S HIDEOUT - DAY

Catfish does a rail of meth off the counter.

He lights a cigarette and sits down in a re-upholstered lazy

boy where a TATTOO ARTIST is setting up...

Catfish proffers his forearm, displaying a row of notches

(kills). And Tattoo Artist begins to outline two more...

Catfish smugs. Drags on his cigarette...

WHEN A SUDDEN GUNSHOT SPRAYS CATFISH WITH BLOOD. Tattoo

Artist drops dead on the floor.

Jesse, standing over Catfish. A .45 comes down twice fast

with a CRACK! Catfish is knocked cold.

INT. BUD'S CAR - DAY

Bud, on police radio, driving high-speed.

INT. METRO OFFICE - SAME

Bud's VOICE over speaker phone. Marandino on the line with a

sheaf of paperwork. Cobb enters.

Bud punches the gas, traveling 90 mph.

INT. CATFISH'S HIDEOUT - DAY

CATFISH'S EYES blink awake - pinpoint dilated. WIDEN TO

REVEAL he's stripped to his boxers, tied to the lazy-boy.

And Jesse is seated beside him.

Jesse rolls a tattoo tray of various HARDWARE towards him:

Needles. Rusted pliers. An electric tattoo drill.

Catfish grins. A wide, Amphetamine smile.

Without warning, Jesse grabs the PLIERS. A flash of movement,

and there's a TERRIBLE SCREAM AS CATFISH'S FRONT TOOTH IS

RIPPED OUT. He bucks violently in his chair.

Jesse jams the DRILL into Catfish's gums, high speed. BLOOD

SPRAYS. Loud, electric pain and Catfish CRIES OUT IN TERROR.

Jesse sets down the drill, deadpan.

Catfish smiles. Lips quivering with hate.

Jesse grabs the pliers, YANKS another tooth. Catfish HOWLS.

BLOOD SPEWS as the drill digs in. Catfish SCREAMS. Jesse

tosses teeth on the tray.

Jesse grabs Catfish's rapidly swelling jaw and yanks hard.

Jesse TIGHTENS his grip. Vice-like. Blood fills Catfish's

mouth. He gurgles, then SPITS in Jesse's face...

...FLASHES OF STEEL and two more teeth rip out at the root.

Catfish SCREAMS then passes out. Jesse slaps him awake.

Catfish, last ounce of spite, cracks a blackened grin:

THE DRILL STRIKES. Bone deep. Gum line splays open. Teeth

crack and split. Catfish SCREAMS UNCONTROLLABLY. Blacks out.

Jesse stops. A brief reprieve. He gets up and looks around

the apartment. SEES: Magazines. A few revolvers. Empty liquor

bottles. Meth on the counter. And on the stove:

A HYPODERMIC NEEDLE. Beside a pie tin, speed base boiling.

Jesse stares. He lowers the syringe into the tin, plunger up,

drawing fluid...

...then very deliberately sticks Catfish's arm with the tip

of the needle, pops a cc.

Catfish bolts awake, EYES WIDE. A long, wet WHEEZE.

Catfish's head lulls. Jesse grabs him by the hair. Leans in.

Jesse looks Catfish dead in the eyes. And death is there...

Begging.

With that, Jesse pushes the plunger down...ever...so...slowly.

Blood burps and bubbles from Catfish's throat. Lungs convulse

and spasm. Eye go wide then roll back. A suicide dose.

JESSE'S CAR racing up I-10, along the roaring Mississippi,

toward a blood red horizon of a Louisiana sundown.

EXT. FRENCH QUARTER, NEW ORLEANS - ESTABLISH - DUSK

Cars line crowded streets in the heart of New Orleans.

I/E. BUD'S CAR - LOWER FRENCH QUARTER - DUSK

TIGHT ON A DASHBOARD CLOCK: 5:04 p.m.

Bud, waiting, parked outside a POLICE PRECINCT in the Lower

French Quarter. Kiersey's pager on the dash. Waiting. Then:

THE PAGER BUZZES.

Bud grabs it, hurries out to a nearby pay-phone. Dials...

Cobb on a database, phone cradled...

Bud slams down the phone. Jumps in his car. Hits the gas.

EXT. GOVERNOR NICHOLLS WHARF - DUSK

A busy promenade near the down river end of the Mississippi.

Bud waits low in his car, parked in a distant lot. Through

the windshield, WE SEE the subject of his surveillance...

A PAY-PHONE

on a crowded sidewalk. Faces pass. A Man in a JACKET arrives

at the phone. He waits. Checks his watch...

...Bud checks his clock: 6:10

The "Jacket" picks up the phone and dials...

KIERSEY'S PAGER GOES OFF.

Jacket waits. No call. Walks away. Bud FOLLOWS on foot...

EXT. FRENCH MARKET - DUSK

A sprawling swirl of humanity, live jazz and bars. The Jacket

passes through. Twenty feet back, Bud keeps pace...

ANOTHER PHONE BOOTH

Jacket enters. Pumps coins into the PAY-PHONE. Dials...

Jacket hangs up. More coins. Another number...

Jacket hangs up. Exits east onto BARRACKS STREET. Glances

over his shoulder, then ahead, as Bud rounds the corner...

EXT. DECATUR AVENUE

Jacket crosses into a LIQUOR STORE.

Bud stalls at the corner, casing the street. Takes everything

in. He reaches for his cigarettes, finds a crumpled back.

Then crosses the street to...

A NEWSSTAND

outside the liquor store. Bud buys cigarettes and a newspaper.

He opens the paper, glances at the headlines. At the same

time, peers into the LIQUOR STORE WINDOW...

...The Jacket walks toward the back of the store and out a

door to an ALLEY.

Bud heads south on Decatur. Lights a cigarette, as he passes

various stores on the block. A private two-story building

with blacked out windows at the far end: "TIBEDAUX'S TAVERN".

Bud turns into...

EXT. A COBBLESTONE ALLEY

Lined with boutiques on one side. Back of Tibedaux's on the

other. A cargo gate is up and MEN are hoisting crates into a

truck...

The Jacket is there, talking to them:

Bud pauses at a DRESS SHOP. Stares into the storefront glass,

reflecting the Jacket and Men...

Jacket walks off. Bud flicks his cigarette, enters...

INT. THE DRESS SHOP

...and peers out the window, watching the Jacket leave the

alley and enter a FRENCH COLONIAL.

INT. FRENCH COLONIAL, LOBBY - DUSK

A SECURITY GUARD behind a desk. As Jacket walks in...

Jacket moves through a warren of CORRIDORS. Hardened MEN

shuttle in and out of private offices. Plates on the doors:

"Material Management." "Plating & Metal". "Demolition"...

Jacket knocks on a door. Opens it to...

A bulked-out man at his desk... MILLS. Looks up as Jacket

enters:

Mills picks up the desk-phone. Dials...

INT. EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRECINCT - DUSK

Braddock, walking down the hall with two POLICEMEN, unlocks a

SUDDENLY HEADLIGHTS FLOOD MARANDINO'S REAR WINDSHIELD.

Ready.

INT. VAN - LATE NIGHT

Marandino, fastens on a vest, loads a 12-Gauge, locks.

Suddenly, through the side window... A LONE FIGURE, IN A

QUARTER TRENCH, MOVES PAST. It happens in a flash.

Marandino LOOKS, SEES only a quick profile as the Figure cuts

between parked cars and walks across the street...

EXT. CAFE - LATE NIGHT

Cobb looks over his shoulder, SEES the Figure 75 yards away,

moving briskly across Esplanade...

We still can't see his face.

Comes to a door. Kicks it in...

INT. PAYROLL OFFICE

...And Mills FIRES a gun, burning Jesse's ear -- Blood pours

down his neck -- and Jesse's Tactical FIRES.

eyes - at the fierce face of death - are filled with Jesse,

who FIRES TWO ROUNDS. One to the head. That fast.

INT. BACK ROOM

Two AB SOLDIERS #7 and #8 hurry in. Lucian, Kay and Bingham

Lucian FIRES.

Bud kneels and PUMPS SHOTS - hits AB #7 and #8 - killing them.

Lucian, Kay, Bingham flee back inside.

INT. TIBEDAUX'S, MAINTENANCE ROOM

Jesse yanks off the cover of the main electric panel. He rips

Bud pursues Lucian...

INT. TIBEDAUX'S

INT. DOWNSTAIRS, BACK ROOMS

Jesse is coming...

...and the SLAUGHTER BUILDS.

He throws open a door to a BAR AREA.

AB #10 and #11 FIRE SMGs WILDLY, running from the room. Jesse

UNLOADS the sawed-off. MISSING. Plaster throws and crumbles.

A GUNSHOT rips through Jesse's left arm. The sawed-off drops

to his side. Jesse turns - EDGAR BINGHAM is FIRING a SERVICE

REVOLVER - SHOTS MISS as Jesse dives behind the bar.

HAROLD KAY is moving down the stairwell. FIRING an Automatic

wildly. Bottles and glasses explode.

Bingham keeps firing. Mirrors SHATTER.

BEHIND THE BAR

bullets splinter wood, Jesse slams another magazine into the

.45. Above him, strays catch lights, glass filaments EXPLODE.

INT. UPSTAIRS, HALLWAYS + ROOMS

Bud KICKS down a door. AB #12 charges out. Grabs for Bud...

who breaks the grab, pulls AB #12's neck down, slams his knee

into his forehead twice, knocked cold. Grabs his gun.

A HALLWAY DOOR SWINGS OPEN

AB #13 emerges, HAMMERING GUNSHOTS. Bud covers. SHOTS BLOW

HOLES in the wall.

A SECOND DOOR OPENS

...and AB #14 steps out, draws. Bud throws him in the way of

CROSS-FIRE. AB #13 takes AB #14's SHOTS.

Both men dead. That fast, and Bud is on the move...

EXT. ALLEY, TIBEDAUX'S - CONTINUOUS

AB #10 and #11 run out and swing their SMGs, FIRING onto the

alley and KILLING MARANDINO... Then charging to the front--

hitting Cobb in the vest. His ribs broken, he sits down

stunned.

AB #11 running past as several BLACK AND WHITES now arrive.

TAKE AND RETURN FIRE -- AB #11 is shot dead.

Police shouting. Civilians running, as...

INT. BACK BAR AREA, DOWNSTAIRS

GUNFIGHT ENSUES.

Jesse rises over the bar, FIRING BURSTS into Kay, who tumbles

down the stairwell like a rag doll.

Bingham shoots Jesse in the hip. He staggers, then falls and

rolls to his back...

Bingham rounds the bar just as Jesse, somehow, lifts the .45

and FIRES two slugs into Bingham's chest.

Bingham collapses on top of Jesse. The .45 hits the floor.

Both men, bleeding profusely, thrash along the floor...

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

Bud, racing toward a stairwell, LEAPS down a flight, turns,

and RUNS down another.

INT. BACK BAR AREA

Jesse, trapped under the heavy Bingham, pulls the buck knife

from his holster and sinks it into Bingham's kidney. TWISTS.

Blood POOLS. Bingham MOANS...

...Jesse rolls the big man over, hoists himself high and

impales Bingham through the throat. Dead.

Jesse exhales, struggles up...rising to his feet...

BLAM! - A SUDDEN GUNSHOT

out of nowhere. JESSE COLLAPSES, A BUNDLE OF TWITCHING

NERVES, BLOOD POOLING FAST OUT THE BACK OF HIS HEAD...

...AND LUCIAN STANDS OVER HIM, HIS .357 SMOKING.

Lucian turns slow. Toward a cracked MIRROR. Suddenly...

IN THE REFLECTION: BUD EXPLODES DOWN THE STAIRS, AND SLAMS

INTO LUCIAN WITH THE IMPACT OF A TRUCK. BOTH HIT THE FLOOR.

Lucian points his gun at Bud's head, who reaches for the

trigger guard, shifts the barrel an inch -- A ROUND GOES OFF,

BLOWING THROUGH BUD'S SHOULDER -- HE YELLS OUT, HOOKS HIS

FINGER IN THE TRIGGER, STOPPING THE NEXT SHOT.

Bud flips Lucian over, rips the gun away. Lucian tries to

break free. Bud grabs him - smashes the gun over and over

against Lucian's face.

Lucian's head BOUNCES. Eyes roll, then right.

Lucian quarter rolls, then CRACKS a forearm into Bud's head.

Again, and Bud is knocked back with a gash over his eye.

Lucian REARS BACK and KICKS HARD into Bud's sternum.

Lucian scrambles. Bud tackles him into a table, which goes

down. A chair breaks. Bud lands a thunderous hook and

Lucian's nose shatters. Another and his cheekbone caves.

Lucian drops like a rock. Tries to crawl under another table.

IN A MANIACAL RAGE, Bud flips the table and stomps down on

Lucian with furious blows that come one after another.

Lucian tries to cover up. BUD IS ALL OVER HIM. Grabs Lucian

by the throat and presses down.

Lucian, fighting to breathe, digs his nails into Bud's face,

tearing skin.

Bud's face twists with hate as he chokes the life out of him.

Lucian's eyes BULGE...His mouth stretches WIDE...clutching at

Bud's fingers, trying to pull away...

Bud SNORTS, tightens his grip... bearing down... And at the

last moment, the cop in him reemerges...

Bud lets go.

Lucian rolls to his side and coughs up a thick ribbon of

blood and vomit. Bud slams on restraints.

Bud staggers to his feet...breathing hard...Spots Jesse on

the floor...And he slows...

Jesse lies in shadow. Perfectly still. We cannot see his face.

Only the dark pool of blood around him.

Lucian passes out.

SLOWLY PULL AWAY AND TRACK OVER THE MASSACRE...

...as POLICE come in...over bodies and blood and guns, and up

the stairs and out a broken window, to the CROWDS in the

street held back by POLICE, past flashing lights and

emergency vehicles...

...to where life goes on in New Orleans.

FADE IN:

EXT. EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRECINCT - DAYS LATER

The sun is out. The sky above is clear.

INT. EAST BATON ROUGE PARISH PRECINCT - DAY

ON BUD, as he leads Lucian through the bowels of city lock-up.

Lucian - in prison garbs, haggard, dark bruises - looks up as

they pass a two-way mirror of an INTERROGATION ROOM, SEES...

KIERSEY

...seated, making statements to Shepard, who is taking notes.

Stacks of Jesse's reports surround them.

Bud walks Lucian past, into...

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM #2

...and Lucian sits at a table. Bud across from him. Silence

hangs, several moments.

ON BUD

starting again, knowing... There's something bigger. A slow

smile spreads...
