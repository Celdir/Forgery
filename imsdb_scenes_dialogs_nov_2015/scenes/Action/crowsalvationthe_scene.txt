The Crow : SALVATION

By

Chip Johannessen

OVER BLACKNESS.

Silence. Broken by the faint clink of precision tools.

Accurately, patiently wielded.

INT. MYSTERY ROOM - DIMNESS

X-CLOSE. A SCALPEL returned to its place in a neat array

of TAXIDERMY TOOLS. Long surgical TWEEZERS taken. A steady

HAND grasps a CLAY BIRD FORM. Then sets the second eye.

Unhurried. Meticulous.

A MYSTERY MAN, features obscured, sets the tweezers aside,

reaches for a black lump on the table, revealed to be shiny

feathers as he wraps it around the form. Adjusts it so the

glass eyes peer out through holes in the skin of this large

CROW. A taxidermy specimen.

WIDE, the man works across the room under the pooled light

of a draftsman's lamp, the Crow on the table in front of

him. His identity yet to discover.

EXT. GARRISON PRISON - WITNESS ENTRANCE - NIGHT

X-WIDE. "THE WALLS" like a medieval castle above a throng

of PROTESTERS and GAWKERS. A POSTCARD at first, then signs

of movement--handheld placards and flickering candles

telegraph an imminent execution.

The group shifts amoeba like as... A LARGE MERCEDES

approaches, slowly works its way into the edge of the crowd.

INSIDE THE BENZ NATHAN RANDALL, father of the victim

comforts ERIN RANDALL, seventeen year old sister, as she

looks up in terror at the bodies pressed against the car,

the throng between the car and the prison entrance. The

car stops.

THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD--a Protestor's poster visible.

"Remember the Victim." With a picture of LAUREN RANDALL,

the deceased, who bears a striking resemblance to surviving

sister Erin. And another sign--"Happy Birthday Alex."

She takes a deep breath, they get out of the car and...

WITH THE RANDALLS as they make their way through the throng

toward a special entrance marked "WITNESSES," nearly within

reach when WHOMP.

Erin shields her face as a BRIGHT LIGHT comes on. OVER TV

REPORTER BARBARA GONZALEZ Action Newsteam addressing the

Nathans. Speaking into a mic.

Nathan pushes past Gonzalez, taking Erin's hand.

The Reporter TURNS to the camera, not missing a beat.

INT. GARRISON PRISON - DEATHROW - NIGHT

CLOSE on a BIRTHDAY CAKE, twenty one candles flickering as

it makes its way past deathrow cells, held waiter style on

one hand by MERCER, a MUSTACHED prison GUARD.

INT. GARRISON PRISON - ALEX'S CELL - NIGHT

CLANG. The barred door opens and the cake swoops in, landing

on a small table next to a CHESS GAME in progress and an

untouched last meal. ADJUST to find...

ALEX CORVIS. Twenty-One today. Disarmingly appealing.

Peaceful. Simple clothes. He looks up from the game, at...

PETER WALSH, Alex's pro-bono attorney and only friend,

trying not to explode at this shit-eating stunt.

Despite himself, Alex looks up. Mercer gestures at... THE

CAKE in the middle of the candles, an arm made of frosting

with a large ZIGZAG marking on the forearm, also frosting.

FAVORING ALEX looking from the cake up to Mercer, who nods

at the candles.

Alex focusses on the chess board. Tries to anyway.

EXT. GARRISON PRISON - NIGHT

FLASH. The harsh Newsteam video light WHUMPS on,

illuminating a WRINKLED OLD WOMAN.

EXT. GARRISON PRISON - WITNESS ENTRANCE - NIGHT

FLASH. A nervous, not to say shifty looking THOMAS "TOMMY"

LEONARD, thirty five year old key witness in the trial,

talks to Gonzalez under the hot video light.

Tommy shifts uncomfortably, silent as we HOLD a long beat.

INT. GARRISON PRISON - ALEX'S CELL - NIGHT

CLOSE. A Chess piece, a CASTLE, shoved at CAMERA. ADJUST

to INCLUDE ALEX.

He breathes deliberately, trying to hold it together. His

hand shakes as he removes it from the piece.

Alex gets up, crosses to a small ledge on the other side

of the cell that holds a few books and pictures. He finds...

A PICTURE OF LAUREN AND ALEX In a grove of tall trees. A

self-portrait by autotimer. Arms around each other. Her

head on his shoulder. Happy.

RESUME Alex staring at the photo, taped to the wall.

EXT GARRISON PRISON - WITNESS ENTRANCE - NIGHT

FLASH. Four UNIFORMED COPS--DUTTON, ERLICH, LARKIN and

TOOMEY--in the harsh news light.

Erlich holds a CANE in one hand. Larkin and Toomey are

twosie monkeys, smoking cigarettes with eerie simultaneity.

Erlich gives a long-suffering look. Like it's preposterous.

But he's too gentlemanly to say it.

Look around. He's right.

INT. GARRISON PRISON - ALEX'S CELL - NIGHT

Alex still gazing at the picture of Lauren. At the board,

Walsh moves a piece.

They look up as Mercer appears outside the barred door to

the cell, starts to unlock it.

It really is. Other prison personnel arrive outside the

cell in various uniforms:

A MINISTER with clerical collar, the WARDEN, two GUARDS.

Waiting. Walsh crosses, very emotional how. Gives Alex a

huge hug.

The two friends exchange a long last look.

As Alex exits past Mercer, Walsh sits down on the cot.

He's hard to read a second until he lashes out, flips...

THE CAKE against the wall where it hits, slides down, still

semi-intact as it hits the floor.

INT. GARRISON PRISON - DEATHROW

Dead Man Walking. A mini parade past the cells of the

condemned. One guard flanks Alex, another follows. The

Warden and Minister out in front.

HANDS extend from the other cells as Alex passes. Unable

to touch, but he reaches for them, a gesture of solidarity.

Mercer catches up with the group, flanking Alex cell-side.

Alex drops his hand, cut off even from that.

INT. GARRISON PRISON - DEATHROW #2 - NIGHT

The parade continues down another hallway.

INT. GARRISON PRISON - DEATH CHAMBER - NIGHT

The CHAIR, an atavism, sits alone a moment before the

entourage enters and begins a surprisingly well

choreographed last dance.

The Warden gestures, and Alex is escorted to his place in

the chair. The Guards move in, death attendants now.

THE MINISTER CONTINUES as...

CLOSE. Handstraps tightened. WHOP. WHOP. Alex squirms

despite his resolve. Through an act of will, calms himself.

Looks up at...

THE PHONE. On the wall. A last possibility of reprise.

CLOSE. Trouser legs slit. Footstraps tightened around bare

ankles. Electrodes checked.

CLOSE. Chest strap tightened. Yanked again for good measure.

ALEX gasps. It's hard to breathe now with the strap tight

across his chest.

CLOSE. Copper mesh. Pieces of sponge jerry-sewn onto it,

the irregular stitching giving it an unsettling natural

appearance.

ADJUST to REVEAL this is the electrode in the odd leather

HELMET tightened now on Alex's head.

THE EXECUTIONER. Pulls a hood over his own obscured face.

Moves behind a half curtain at the side of the room.

SLAP. The Minister shuts his bible. WIDER. Some weird sin.

Alex strapped into the chair, unable to move.

The guards exit, jobs done. The Warden nots and...

ALEX'S POV - THROUGH PLEXI - THE OBSERVATION ROOM REVEALED

as the CURTAINS OPEN.

Two dozen observers crammed into a space the width of a

singlewide trailer. Erin. Her father. The Cops. Tommy

Leonard. Gonzalez and other media types. Prison personnel.

Every seat occupied. Sweaty and surreal. All looking at

him. IN THE DEATH CHAMBER The Warden steps forward.

A thick silence. Alex looks unprepared, uneasy as he scans

a sea of hostile faces, settling on Erin and her dad.

Erin shakes her head, disgusted. Looks away.

ALEX'S POV - THE LAST SECONDS OF HIS LIFE SLOWING in his

inner perception, movement ramping down as Alex scans the

disbelieving faces.

The Phone. Silent. No reprise. The Observation Room witness

door opens. A Guard in the back row deferentially offers

his seat to the NEW ARRIVAL, a man in dark clothes, his

face obscured by REFLECTIONS in the plexiglass. As he

UNBUTTONS his shirt cuff...

The warden steps to the side of the room, nods to the

executioner who lifts a COVER off a large switch.

The New Arrival pulls his shirtsleeve back over his forearm,

exposing a scar for Alex, THE SCAR, an odd zigzag pattern

of raised welts, a pattern deliberately formed of skin.

The Executioner throws the switch. ON ALEX SHAKING violently

as he fights to stay alive, time extremely subjective now

as he chokes out...

The word bubbles up as if from underwater, audible only to

Alex. Alex wrenches his head, a superhuman act of will

trying to ID the Scar Man through the reflections.

THE HELMET starts to smoke. Then a burst of FLAME at Alex's

head.

A BOTCHED EXECUTION made worse by Alex's struggle to see,

to stay alive.

IN THE OBSERVATION ROOM The observers panic, horrified.

Only the Scar Man calm as he covers his arm, rebuttons his

shirt. Face always obscured.

IN THE DEATH CHAMBER Alex in electro-spasm, smoke filling

the room, the warden in real time now as he runs to pull

the curtain closed.

It JAMS partway across. ALEX expires in the char,

grotesquely burned, EYES OPEN as the Warden finally yanks

the curtain closed.

IN THE OBSERVATION ROOM The Scar Man slips out, but the

rest remain, transfixed, horrified. Erin and others in

tears. HOLD a long beat, their GASPS faintly audible.

Then...

INT. GARRISON PRISON - MORGUE HALLWAY - NIGHT

Two guards push a gurney down a reverberant hallway far

from the in-your-face security of deathrow.

They WIPE past, Alex's charred remains visible a moment,

parts of the helmet fused on his face and head, his body

convulsed in a pugilistic attitude.

INT. GARRISON PRISON - MORGUE - NIGHT

The guards swing the gurney to a stop by a steel locker,

one of several. Mercer opens the locker door. The

unceremoniously slide the body into the locker and...

BANG. The body hits the open door. Convulsed as it is, the

body won't really fit through the door.

CRUNCH. The sound of something breaking as the SHOVE Alex

into the cubby hole.

FROM INSIDE THE LOCKER. The door slams shut.

INT. GARRISON PRISON - ALEX'S CELL - NIGHT

CLOSE on the PICTURE of Alex and Lauren.

ADJUST to include Walsh, looking at it. Pained. Still trying

to understand. He secures it to the lid of the case already

containing the neatly packed chess set. Closes it. Bows

his head.

EXT. GARRISON PRISON - NIGHT

The protestors are gone, as is the Newsteam, but the four

Cops are still there, Larkin and Toomey synchro-smoking.

They look up as the Randalls emerge shaken from the Witness

entrance.

FAVORING NATHAN RANDALL He speaks softly to Erin, who's

leaning against him.

She continues on and Randall crosses to the cops, who wait

patiently to see what he'll say. Finally...

Randall nods. Like that's all anyone could say. As he walks

off the Cops fall into easy chatter. CUT TO:

INT. MYSTERY ROOM - DIMNESS

CLOSE. A face slides into frame in PROFILE, too tight to

be recognizable.

Just an eye, peering...

EYE'S POV - THROUGH A MAGNIFYING GLASS A coarse ZIGZAG

stitch shaped like the Scar runs the length of the Crow's

underbelly. The end stitch now tied with a tiny knot.

Tightened just so. THE MYSTERY MAN features obscured still,

grabs a bent surgical SCISSORS, snips the excess thread.

Smoothes black feathers into place, hiding the stitching

on...

THE CROW Finished. The Man gets up, leaves.

CAMERA PUSHING on the Bird's head as we HEAR a door shut,

still PUSHING on the glass eye that BLINKS now.

INT. GARRISON PRISON - MORGUE - NIGHT

INSIDE THE LOCKER. A human EYE BLINKS. Barely visible in

the darkness. Alex KICKS with a YELL and...

IN THE MORGUE.  The locker door flies open and Alex spills

onto the floor. Gropes a few seconds on hands and knees

before a SHADOW passes over him evoking a primitive

response. He cowers, looks up at...

A LARGE CROW flutters through the bars of a high window,

lands near him on the floor. It looks at him, then flaps

its way up to the autopsy countertop, cocks its head. Follow

me.

ALEX strains to pull himself up on the gurney that brought

him here.

HIS POV as he slowly rises above the gurney--the Crow in

front of a mirror over the splash sink. It flies off,

revealing Alex's reflection. Charred. Hideous.

ALEX drops back to the floor with a SCREAM. Turns, sees

himself in a stainless door and SMASHES it with his fist...

THE BASHED STAINLESS DOOR the word "MORGUE," painted on

the wall behind Alex, brought into focus at the center of

the concavity. ALEX thrashes, trying to avoid his

reflection, but the dim mirrors have him surrounded.

THE CROW flaps down, crazed too, as if in empathy. CAWING

loudly, finally getting Alex's attention. ALEX settles,

hazards another look at his reflection in stainless steel.

His body looks less misshapen now. He looks at his arms,

hands, no longer burned. Pulls himself up on the gurney

again, cautiously.

OVER ALEX as he slowly rises above the gurney a second

time, looks in the mirror. His body miraculously HEALED,

covered by shredded clothing.

His face obscured by the meltdown helmet. He slowly

approaches the mirror on unsteady feet.

Alex starts to tear away the helmet and gets a first

frightening FLASH as his fingers touch it...

ALEX'S INTERNAL POV - FLASHBACK A blitz return to his own

execution. The copper screen, the helmet lowered into place.

Electro-spasm. The faintest glimpse of a jagged scar seen

darkly.

RESUME -ALEX clutching the helmet on his head, ripping it

off in one painful OVERCRANKED movement and...

OVER ALEX, IN THE MIRROR It's Alex, and yet not. His face

marked with the Crow MASK, jagged WARPAINT where the melted

helmet ran down his face. An indelible reminder of the

botched execution. he stares at himself for a couple of

deep breaths. Then WHAM! Shatters the mirror with a martial

punch.

THE FRACTURED MIRROR Alex's mask reflected in shards as

his busy hands remove certain pieces of broken glass. His

purpose unclear.

INT. GARRISON PRISON - MORGUE HALLWAY - NIGHT

The Crow hops out into the hallway, flies toward us, lands

with a CAW as Alex enters the hallway, framed against hight

walls. His tentative movements growing more assured.

The Crow flies off and Alex follows, to... A DOOR marked

"No Unauthorized Entry." As they pass through...

INT. GARRISON PRISON - SECURITY BOOTH - NIGHT

CLOSE on a MONITOR, a SCHEMATIC MAP of the prison. A small

red light FLASHES. The GUARD keys a communications radio.

INT. GARRISON PRISON - MORGUE HALLWAY - NIGHT

WITH the LEGS of a Guard walking quickly. REVEAL Mercer.

His RADIO crackling.

He passes through the "No Unauthorized Entry" door into...

INT. GARRISON PRISON - "B-5" HALLWAY - NIGHT

Empty. Bars at the far end spell seriously secure territory.

Mercer moves cautiously up the empty hallway, stops as...

The Crow hops out from a side hallway. Drawing him on.

Mercer pulls out his NIGHTSTICK, loses the bird as it hops

back THROUGH BARS into...

INT. GARRISON PRISON - ALEX'S CELL - NIGHT

Alex looks around his now empty cell. On the wall is a

rectangle, clearer than the wall around it, where the

photograph of Alex and Lauren had been before Walsh removed

it. Alex goes up to thewall and touches the spot.

FLASH! ALEX'S INTERNAL POV FLASH of LAUREN, laughing as

she beckons to someone, Alex, who joins her in frame as we

hear the whir of the camera auto-timer. A click, as the

picture is taken. Alex and Lauren are frozen in the pose

of Alex's photograph.

RESUME The picture is gone. Alex, perplexed, stands looking

at the blank spot on the wall for a moment. He turns and

exits the cell...

INT. GARRISON PRISON - DEATHROW - NIGHT

Mercer is peering through the double-barred gate at the

end of the row as Alex emerges from his former cell.

Alex looks up, sees Mercer and FLASH...

ALEX'S INTERNAL POV A pop of Mercer bringing the birthday

cake. A wash of flame, twenty one candles. A blip of Walsh.

Of a White King.

RESUME Alex perplexed, looking at the cake still littering

the floor of his ex-cell, candles melted down. Mercer works

his way through the double-barred doors onto the row.

The INMATE occupying the cell next to Alex's peers out

through the bars, vanishes again as Mercer WHOPS the bars

once with his nightstick.

WHOOSH. Mercer swings his NIGHTSTICK at Alex's head. Alex

catches it, instinctively in one hand. Mercer reaches for...

A RED PANIC BUTTON hanging off his guard belt. Mercer slams

it. FAVORING ALEX lets go of the stick, looks at his own

hand, surprised.

WHAM!  Mercer broadsides Alex's head with the stick. Alex

goes down shocked, not from pain, from the fact that someone

would attack him.

WHAM WHAM WHAM. Mercer brutalizes Alex, collapsed at his

feet as... TWO GUARDS enter the far end of the Row, race

toward Alex's cell, one holding a TASER. Its LASER SIGHT

finds Alex, crumpled in front of Mercer.

Looks like it's over. The guards relax. ALEX suddenly looks

up at Mercer. Zero damage from the blows.

Alex wheels around as Guard One squeezes the trigger.

CROWVISION The Taser Darts speed toward Camera.

RESUME Alex shunts himself to the side and the TASER DARTS

impale themselves in Mercer's thighs. He drops fibrillating.

A CHEER goes up from the men in their cells, who become

progressively rowdier as the guards BOLT and Alex follows,

strength in his stride, nightstick in hand.

Pieces of FLAMING TOILETPAPER flung now from the cells of

Deathrow.

AT THE FAR ENTRANCE the two Guards scramble to get the

door closed behind them before Alex catches up. They'd

make it except Alex hurls...

THE NIGHTSTICK flying end over end like a throwing knife,

catching the trailing guard in the back of the head,

dropping him in the door, propping it open.

ALEX enters the cage entrance to Deathrow, sharing the

space with the Guard still standing.

The frightened Guard opens the door into the next hallway

and bolts. Leaving the keys. The Crow hopping, screaming...

INT. GARRISON PRISON - SECURITY BOOTH - NIGHT

CLOSE on a SCHEMATIC MAP of the prison. Lit up like a

Christmas tree now with flashing red lights. The Guard

keys a communications radio.

Another LIGHT goes on. They're starting to make a line.

Buzzers going off now. A general ALARM sounded.

INT. GARRISON PRISON - STAIRWELL - NIGHT

The Crow flaps up the stairwell. Alex on its heels, taking

steps three at a time.

AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRWELL The Crow waits on a LANDING

with a door marked "Emergency Use Only." Plus a dozen lines

of assorted instructions. Guards' feet THUNDER below,

approaching.

He opens the door. The ALARM is LOUD.

EXT. GARRISON PRISON - ROOFTOP - NIGHT

Dark a moment. Then a HUGE SPOTLIGHT hits Alex, casting

long shadows. He looks up at a GUARD TOWER, the source of

the light. And of a BULLHORN VOICE.

As if in defiance, the Crow hops toward the fence, old

chain link topped with razorwire along the perimeter of

the roof.

BULLHORN VOICE CONTINUES as Alex follows... ALEX'S POV

through the fence, down fifty feet to the pavement.

Alex turns, sees... A HALF DOZEN GUARDS emerge from the

stairwell to the top of the roof, level weapons at Alex.

ON THE FENCE - ALEX climbs quickly to the top, where he

grabs two painful handfuls of razorwire that cut deeply

into this hand. He extricates himself, balancing atop the

fence. And looks...

ALEX'S HANDS The jagged bloodlines disappear, miraculously

heal.

FAVORING ALEX as he holds up his hands to show the guards,

a kid-like smile on his face.

They respond by raising their weapons and BAM BAM BAM.

Alex hurls himself off the edge in a hail of Gunfire that

Dopplers down to silence as he falls, falls...

EXT. GARRISON PRISON - BASE OF THE WALLS - NIGHT

AT THE BASE OF "THE WALLS" Alex hits, flushing PIGEONS,

that fill frame with manic wings.

As the SPOTLIGHT sweeps toward Alex he rolls off, over the

sidewalk, between two parked cars.

EXT. GARRISON PRISON - ROOFTOP - NIGHT

ON THE ROOFTOP Mercer and the others stand there dumbstruck,

looking down as the SPOTLIGHT finds nothing.

A RADIO CRACKLES. Mercer keys it a beat later.

Mercer moves the radio away from his head.

EXT. GARRISON PRISON - BASE OF THE WALLS - NIGHT

AT THE BASE OF "THE WALLS" Illuminated by spill from the

Spotlight, Alex crouches between two cars. He leans forward,

checking his reflection in a CHROME HUBCAP. A huge smile

spreads over his face.

He laughs. Life--or whatever this is--is good. So far.

EXT. CITY - AIRBORNE - NIGHT

The CROW flies past tall buildings downtown.

EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

The crow flies past letters P-O-L-I-C-E on the side of an

older building taking us to...

INT. POLICE STATION - EVIDENCE ROOM - NIGHT

SMASH. A hand punches through a sash window, right through

the imbedded security wires, roughly rips off the latch

inside. Retracts, bleeding. The window opens.

It's Alex, on the fire escape, checking out his arm as the

BLEEDING STOPS.

Alex follows the Crow into the dark room packed with file

cabinets and evidence bins, wire lockers. And a desk, strewn

with POLICE FORMS. Plus a vertical SPIKE with processed

evidence request FORMS impaled on it.

The Crow makes its way to a file cabinet, the top drawer

marked "Cl-Cr."  Alex lingers a moment at the desk, eye on

the spike.

WHOP. Alex drives his hand onto the SPIKE. Looks up,

delighted. CAW.

The Crow gives Alex an admonishing look. Alex pulls the

spike from his hand. Instant healing.

Alex opens the top drawer. Looking for... he's not sure

what. Glibly goes through folders.

He stops. Pulls out the first FILE out in a thick section

marked "CORVIS, ALEXANDER F." Having caught a glimpse of...

IN THE FILE - ALEX'S MUG SHOT And rap sheet. X-CLOSE. We

see "Murder 1st degree," "Penalty Phase: Find for

Execution."

But even this has little interest for him as the finds the

words "Lauren Randall" on the page.

ALEX rips the drawer out of the file cabinet, dumps it

CRASHING on the ground. He drops to the floor with a growing

sense of dread, feeling with both hands, finding...

A SPLAY OF PHTOGRAPHS encased in plastic -- the

prosecutions' background presentation on Alex and Lauren.

The first photo shows LAUREN Posing jauntily, her arm around

a Snowman. She and the Snowman wear matching Boston Red

Sox caps.

ALEX'S INTERNAL POV On Alex, anticipating...WHAP!  A

snowball nails him square in the face.

WIDE to reveal LAUREN running for cover as Young Alex scoops

up snow for ammo. He lobs a snowball at Lauren, just as

she slips to the ground. she doesn't get up right away.

Alex is just a shade concernec as he runs over to her. He

reaches the spot to find LAUREN in the snow, waving her

arms and legs to make a snow angel. She looks up at him

and beckons him to lie on top of her.

RESUME Alex's pained smile at the memory, until he finds:

THE MURDER WEAPON A rough looking hunting knife bagged and

tagged as "AC-005: Murder Weapon."

ALEX frantic now, spreading out the file contents,

finding...

CRIME SCENE PHOTOS In a Grove of tall trees, Lauren

Randall's stabbed and mutilated body, her neck slashed,

head lolling sideways, melds with...

EXT. THE OLD GROWTH GROVE

ALEX'S INTERNAL POV Brief glimpses of Lauren with Alex in

the Grove, happy, like the still photo Alex kept in his

cell.

INT. POLICE STATION - EVIDENCE ROOM - NIGHT

RESUME Alex full-blown tortured now, throwing things.

Alex SMASHES his own head against the metal file cabinets,

wounding himself on the handles, droplets of blood flying

now, spattering the evidence on the floor.

He reaches for the KNIFE, the murder weapon, to end the

pain and FLASH...

INT. COURTROOM - DAY

ALEX'S INTERNAL POV A tunnelvision pop of Tommy Leonard on

the witness stand. The knife held up for him by an unseen

lawyer.

INT. POLICE STATION - EVIDENCE ROOM - NIGHT

RESUME Alex shakes his head "no." Incredulous, horrified.

The fury abating with a growing sense of mission.

Alex fishing through the detritus around him, finding...

"THE LIST" A list of witnesses by category with contact

numbers, addresses. Alex's finger finds Eyewitness Thomas

Leonard.

THE DOOR TO THE EVIDENCE ROOM opens.

A YOUNG COP enters, walks slowly past rows of file cabinets,

looking down empty aisles until finding the file drawerful

Alex dumped. But Alex is gone.

The Young Cop looks up as the Crow departs through the

window and two other cops arrive. One of them Dutton.

Dutton walks to the mess on the floor, curious. He squats.

Picks up a tag marked "Murder Weapon AC-005" staples ripped

out, nothing attached to it. Takes in the crime scene photos

of Lauren. Off the PIX...

EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT

CAMERA DRIFTS down through dark trees FINDING Alex at a

grave beneath a sheltering tree.

He's kneeling in front of a HEADSTONE. "Lauren Randall

1982-2000. Always With Us."

The Crow perched nearby. Camera circles Alex who looks up

as the headstone WIPES through frame and...

ALEX'S INTERNAL POV LAUREN NATHAN, a compelling sixteen

year old, circles making an oddly sexy version of the "Oooo"

Bruce Lee sound. A goof, a game she's playing with Alex,

who circles opposite.

As Alex wipes by...

RESUME Camera continues to circle Alex at the grave.

ALEX'S INTERNAL POV More goof kung fu, the circle closing.

Lauren laughing more, searching for words.

RESUME Resolve strengthening.

ALEX'S INTERNAL POV Lauren's starting to crack up, trying

to think of what comes next.

They look at each other a long moment. As they kiss...

RESUME

ALEX'S INTERNAL POV Lauren in his arms as the kiss ends,

and she answers a question we never heard.

RESUME OVER THE CROW. Camera stops circling. Alex looks up

at the headstone, silent tears in his eyes as...

A SINGLE BLOOD RED TEAR rolls down the cheek of the angel

atop the headstone. Alex stops it with his finter.

WIDER, the supplicant at the grave. And the Crow nearby.

INT. MERCEDES - TRAVELLING - NIGHT - RAIN

A GIRL'S HAND clutches a HEART SHAPED LOCKET.

TILT UP, it's Erin, wearing an identical LOCKET around her

neck. School uniform, pleated skirt and school books. The

splish splash of the wipers the only sound until...

Nathan looks over. Sees she's holding the Locket.

Off her dad...

EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT - RAIN

The Benz stops on the roadway beneath Lauren's grave. The

door opens...

ERIN gets out in the pouring rain pulling her jacket HOOD

up over her head. Locket in hand she runs to...

LAUREN'S GRAVE The tree a shelter from the downpour.  Erin's

approaching the headstone when Alex emerges from behind

the trunk. Drenched. She YELPS.

He holds his hands up, compliant. She doesn't bolt. But

she's ultra-cautious. Like with a snarling dog.

She lifts the Locket around her neck. Visible to anyone.

OS, the car door opens. Then SLAMS shut. Nathan approaches.

She whips around, points at... Alex is gone.

She shakes her head, confused, then, looking around spots...

THE HEADSTONE. The track from the RED TEAR indelible even

in the downpour.

Off Erin, as she touches the angel's stained cheek. And

her dad, soggy in the rain...

EXT. TENEMENT BUILDING - RAIN - NIGHT

A street LIGHT flickers on. Maybe because night has fallen

or maybe its just a rainy day.

Thomas Leonard hikes up his collar, trying to stay dry, as

he pauses a clutch of hookers huddled in a doorway...

He shakes his head--don't need that grief--continues on to

the next building and CAMERA FINDS...

ALEX watching, holding "The List." He crosses off the name

for Eyewitness "Thomas Leonard."

INT. TENEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT

Tommy clears the stairs, heads for his door. Unlocking the

second lock, he looks around, alert, like he heard

something. Then opens the door.

INT. TENEMENT - TOMMY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Alex waits for Tommy, crouched by an OPEN WINDOW that looks

out onto an alley, a four story drop.

Tommy starts toward Alex, who pulls the KNIFE from the

Evidence Room.

WHAM. Alex pins what looks like Tommy's arm. It's just his

jacket, but it immobilizes Tommy.

Alex HEAVES Tommy crashing into the window, smashing the

glass and cheap aluminum frame.

Tommy hanging halfway in, halfway out. Four floors above

the alley. Alex rips Tommy's shirt where the knife already

cut it. JACKS the sleeve down. No scar there.

TOMMY'S WIFE enters from the bedroom, SCREAMING.

Heavy eye makeup, looking like she just woke up. OS, a

TODDLER CRIES as she throws herself on Alex and they spill

back inside.

But she doesn't leave. She pleads in wrenching SOBS that

seem to affect Alex. The Crow lands in the window.

Her MASCARA runs down her cheeks, a facsimile of Alex's

mask. They share a long look, connected by pain.

The Crow cawing a warning, hopping in the window as...

Tommy nods at his wife, who heads off to the bedroom. The

Crow gives Alex an admonishing CAW, then takes flight.

Tommy's wife returns, holding a fifteen month old BOY.

Alex unfolds "The List," passes it to Tommy, blank side

up.

But Tommy takes a look at "The List" and flips it over...

"THE LIST" Tommy points to the Police Witness list. Dutton,

Erlich, Larkin, Toomey.

ALEX drops his head. All clear now. He laughes gently at

the sound of SIRENS approaching, still blocks away.

INT. MYSTERY ROOM - DIMNESS

CAMERA CREEPS toward the by now familiar Mystery Man, bent

over his work at the table across the room.

CLOSE. A lineup of short (2") rods. One selected with a

pair of surgical forceps,

INSERTED through a hole in human flesh, raising a

considerable welt. Some bleeding.

As the man reaches for a cotton ball, he notices an empty

STAND among the taxidermy specimens. Marked "Corvus

brachyrhynchos."

He scans the table, searching, then throws up his hands,

shielding his face as a Crow flies out of the darkness,

right at him.

The man turns toward Camera but we never see his face as

the Crow wheels mid-air, flying past him a second time. As

the Crow flies up and out a SMALL WINDOW, the man stands,

hands on the desk. SLOW PUSH on the man, on...

A ZIGZAG PATTERN of raised welts on the underside of his

forearm, in high relief under the Draftsman's lamp.

The "Scar." A drop of blood zigzags, running downward.

SLOW FADE OUT. OVER BLACK, the CRACKLE of a Police Radio.

We're...

EXT. CITY STREET #1 - NIGHT

HIGH ANGLE. A police CRUISER has stopped a late model

CADILLAC SEVILLE on a deserted street.

IN THE POLICE CAR CLOSE. COP I.D. "Dutton, Philip" with a

picture of the same face CAMERA FINDS working a bad comb-

over in the rearview mirror.

IN THE SEVILLE TRACY, almost sixteen, dressed for nightlife,

sees Dutton primping in her rearview mirror. He's getting

out now.

She jostles her friend JANNIE, passed out in the front

passenger seat, trying to rouse her. No luck. DUTTON motions

and Tracy buzzes down the window.

Tracy tries hard to keep her smile going as she looks

through her purse. Not finding anything.

Tracy paws through her purse some more. Vamping.

Dutton leaves that dangling. Circles around to the passenger

side...

Dutton opens Jannie's door, leans in, slides a hand between

her slightly parted legs. Dutton smiles at Tracy.

CROWVISION High overhead. Tracy steps out of the car. Dutton

shuts the passenger door, points. Tracy moves behind the

Seville.

RESUME Dutton closes in. She's getting very nervous.

Tracy bends over the car trunk. Dutton eases her feet apart

with the tip of his boot then pulls out his NIGHTSTICK,

uses it to lift her tiny skirt slowly up over her butt. As

he does, she stands back up, shakes her head "no."

Tracy's frantic, about to call out as Dutton moves to the

passenger door, opens it and...

OVER DUTTON - ALEX sits in the passenger seat now. Jannie

shunted inward.

Dutton pulls his 9MM BARETTA on Alex.

With insolent slowness, Alex finishes writing...

"THE LIST" a red line drawn through Dutton's name.

ALEX gets out of the car. Dutton SLAMS the door and Janie

stirs, coming to. At least a bit.

Alex advances on Dutton.

CLOSE. Dutton's finger squeezes the trigger.

BAM! The shot blows Alex back at the Seville passenger

window. Slumped face against the car.

Jannie's head pops up inside the car. She SCREAMS at...

JANNIE'S POV Alex right in her face, nice and dead. Dutton

lowers his gun BG. Tracy in a panic. Suddenly, Alex opens

his eyes, smiles.

Face distorted against the glass. She screams again.

ALEX wheels around, wrenches Dutton's wrist, vise gripped.

Dutton's gun falls to the ground.

Tracy rushes to the driver side.

Tracy SCREECHES off leaving Dutton in shock.

Alex draws the KNIFE--the murder weapon--from his costume.

FLASH. The knife moves and RIP! Alex yanks the sleeve off

Dutton's uniform, revealing a SCARLESS FOREARM.

Alex glitches, hearing this a second time, then RAMS Dutton

into a wall with a great CLATTER of trash cans.

Alex all over him, holding Dutton's head firmly in his two

hands, like he could crush it in an instant.

Alex's thumbs inch toward Dutton's eyes, grazing Dutton's

eyelids now and a wild thing happens.

FLASH!  ALEX'S INTERNAL POV Dutton's Nightstick lifts

Lauren's skirt.

Then flashs of a bloodsoaked struggle, Lauren's death. And

the surprise BAM! of a shot fired.

RESUME Alex thrown by this. Relaxes his grip on Dutton.

Dutton kicks him off, smashes a garbage can over Alex's

back then pulls a SMALL SEMI-AUTO from an ankle holster.

BAM! Alex barely slowed by the shot, advancing, Dutton

starting to panic. BAM!

Alex keeps coming, right up to the gun. Pointed right at

his face, then...

WHOOSH. Alex flips it around, RAMS the gun in Dutton's

mouth. He couldn't talk if he wanted to.

BAM! We HEAR the blast as we... CUT TO:

INT. "THE HOLE" - NIGHT

BAM BAM continues, but these are TOY GUNS, fired in synch

with POUNDING MUSIC.

In the hands of TWO STRIPPERS. Topless, leather G's and

chokers, black stockings, POLICE HATS on their heads, law

enforcement stars for earrings.

The CAPACITY CROWD responds as they pout, wield their

weapons.

AT THE ENTRANCE - MADDEN a straightfaced plainclothes

detective, more upscale than the clientele, flashes a BADGE

at a BOUNCER who scowls, lets him pass.

WITH MADDEN circumnavigating the mainstage, where the cop-

strippers are waving handcuffs now. At the edge of the

room, LAP-DANCERS pull one-on-one's for twenties. Madden

exits...

INT. "THE HOLE" - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

BACKSTAGE Madden moves past girls in various stages of

undress. Smoking, yapping, waiting to go onstage. One looks

up, interested, but he doesn't look back, exits into...

INT. "THE HOLE" - INTERNET PORN FACILITY

AN INTERNET PORN FACILITY Where "live" sex workers man

tiny fantasy sets--a Dungeon, a Shower, a desk and

blackboard meant to suggest a Schoolroom. Crudely built,

but good enough for 500x800 pixel resolution. Madden stops

a second, looking...

OVER A MONITOR - THE DUNGEON SET UPDATES every six seconds,

the slowly changing low-rez version of the action on the

set--a woman tied to a chair with bright surgical tubing.

The picture refreshes and BG, the woman sneaks an expertly

timed sip of Diet Coke, puts the can away before the picture

updates again.

A COUNTER shows 132,768 hits and climbing. Madden gives a

look, like people are really fucked up, continues past a

curtain with a "No Admittance" sign into...

INT. "THE HOLE" - BACK HALL - NIGHT

A BACK HALL dark, the furthest recesses of the building.

Madden continues cautiously toward... A DOOR

INT. THE HOLE - BACK ROOM - NIGHT

The door is cracked open. Madden moving very quietly now,

scowling as he peers through the slight opening.

Three guys and whirring machines counting stacks of money.

Guns on the tabletops, in holsters, out of reach.

The door flies open.

A moment of panic as the guys bent over the machines freeze.

Raise their hands, slowly turn. Then lower their hands.

It's Erlich, Larkin and Toomey. Three cops we met at the

execution. Erlich's cane nearby.

Erlich, Larkin and Toomey exchange a look. Madden goes to

one of the money counters and grabs...

A STACK OF TWENTIES tossed violently at the ceiling.

Larkin and Toomey scramble as the bills flutter down like

leaves, picking them up.

The Three exchange looks.

Erlich and Madden share a look. On the same wavelength.

Erlich picks up his weapon off the table.

EXT. CITY STREET #1 - NIGHT

A large CRIME SCENE marked off by tape, Dutton's cruiser

where he left it. Several other cruisers nearby, lights

flashing. An ambulance, stretcher being unloaded now.

AN ACTION NEWSTEAM the one we've seen before, Barbara

Gonzalez frontman, speaking into a mic, too far away for

us to hear.

INT. RANDALL HOUSE - ERIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

CLOSE on a TV. Gonzalez audible now.

Gonzalez CONTINUES UNDER as...

The SOUND of footsteps racing down the hall.

Randall riveted by the TV now.

ON THE TV the Newsteam and Gonzalez SHOVED back by COPS

running defense for the stretcher. Gonzalez grabs for the

sheet covering the body and...

NEWSCAM TIGHT on Dutton, as the sheet pulls down, partially

uncovering...

DUTTON'S HEAD: Comb-over hanging to the side. Blood dripping

from crude letters carved in his bald pate--the word

"DAISY."  Quickly covered by a COP who yells at Gonzalez...

... but through a digital miracle the "Daisy" frame has

been grabbed, and appears as a still now behind Gonzalez.

RESUME - FAVORING ERIN struck dumb by this.

Gonzalez FADES UNDER as Erin backs away from the TV.

Off Randall, as he sits on the bed, thoughtful...

EXT. CITY STREET #1 - NIGHT

WIDE. The ambulance drives off, lights flashing, and we

BOOM UP over the crime scene, over the Newsteam, revealing

the top of Dutton's cruiser, marked with a BLOODRED CROW.

Continuing upward, FINDING... The Crow, perched high on a

building. It takes flight.

EXT. CITY - AIRBORNE - NIGHT

The Crow soaring through this lousy part of town.

EXT. LOW-RENT OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT

The Crow swoops in, lands on the roof of a low end brick

building, peers down over the edge.

Camera DRIFTS DOWN the side of he building finding a light,

someone burning the midnight oil.

FINDING a CHESS SET mid-game near the open window as...

INT. WALSH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

WAM! Erlich's CANE knocks a pile of papers to the floor

off a desk piled high with briefs.

Erlich flips through a Rolodex, knocks it to the floor,

then picks up a PHONE LOG off the desk.

He tosses the phone log out the window.

EXT. LOW-RENT OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT

HIGH ANGLE. Watching the phone log fluttering down.

INCLUDE ALEX, sitting where the Crow was perched, wearing

Dutton's badge on his evolving costume.

Alex winces at the voices faint but audible from below.

"THE LIST" The name "Erlich, Vincent" crossed off now by

Alex.

INT. WALSH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Erlich limps through frame toward Walsh, grabs him roughly

by the collar.

Erlich violently tosses Walsh crashing back toward the

window, falling by the chess board.

Erlich exits, slamming the door behind him. Walsh starts

to get up, stops. Looking at his own eye level...

ALEX'S CHESS BOARD set up identically to the game in Alex's

cell, a piece of FOLDED PAPER protruding from under the

board. Walsh pulls it out.

It says "Q-->B5" WALSH makes the move, Queen to Bishop

Five. Smiles. Looks at...

THE PAPER UNFOLDED says "Check." Walsh sets it down in the

Chess Box next to...

THE PICTURE OF ALEX AND LAUREN arms around each other in

the woods, smiling.

WALSH sensing something, a presence.

Walsh moves cautiously to the curtains, draws them back.

Nothing. He leans out the window.

EXT. LOW-RENT OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT

CROWVISION: Starting on Walsh, popping his head out the

window two stories down, INCLUDING Erlich as he exits the

building, gets in a SILVER PORSCHE.

Picture bending wildly as the Porsche takes off and the

Crow takes flight.

EXT. CITY STREET #2 - INTERSECTION - NIGHT

A RED TRAFFIC LIGHT. The Porsche pulling to a stop.

IN THE PORSCHE Erlich looks down, presses a button on the

stereo. Elvis from his baroque period "If I can Dream."

Erlich looks up, waves his arms.

ERLICH'S POV - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD A BUM starts to

"clean" the windshield with an OILY rag, leaving opaque

smears on the once clean glass.

THUD. A handful of gravelly MUD lands on the windshield,

starts to get smeared around. ERLICH pounding the window

from inside.

The bum is giving the driver side window the same treatment.

Hard to see anything now. Erlich throws up his hands in

disgust, reaches for the door handle just as...

SMASH!  The driver side window SHATTERS as something enters

at high speed KICKING Erlich across the car...

Erlich's head bounces off the passenger window, leaving a

BLOODY SMEAR. Alex in the driver seat now.

LOW ANGLE ON THE PORSCHE wheels spinning as it peels out.

INT. CORVETTE - TRAVELLING - NIGHT

WINDSHIELD WASHERS and WIPERS clear away the grime Alex

smeared on the windshield, revealing that we're rocketing

through a bad part of town.

MUSIC CONTINUES as Alex pulls the KNIFE out of his costume

with his LEFT HAND. It looks huge in the cramped sports

car.

Erlich pulls a .380 SEMI-AUTO stashed between the two seats.

Points it at Alex.

Alex FLOORS it and... BAM.

Erlich blows a hole through Alex's LEFT ARM, a yawning

aperture through which Erlich watches the passing scenery

a few improbably seconds.

The WOUND closes. Knife still in Alex's hand.

WHOP. In one swift move Alex impales the knife THROUGH

ERLICH'S WRIST, into his thigh. Erlich SCREAMS, tries to

remove the knife, but Alex keeps a firm grip on the handle.

Erlich tries to stay steely, yells louder as...

EXT. CITY STREET #2 - NIGHT

The Corvette bumps over a sidewalk, runs a red light.

A POLICE CRUISER going the other way pulls a stunt U, flips

on its lights. In hot pursuit.

INT. CORVETTE - TRAVELLING - NIGHT

Bumpier now as Alex's driving gets more and more erratic.

FLASH. Alex yanks the Knife out and FLASH, slices through

the left arm of Erlich's jacket, sawing into the FLESH.

Erlich's arm bleeding.

Alex grimaces, then RIP, he yanks the sleeves off Erlich's

arm. Erlich looks down, surprised to see his arm intact.

Alex poises the knife for another descent.

This gives Alex pause. He shakes his head, clearing the

reality glitch, looks up...

IN THE REARVIEW MIRROR Cop cars, lights flashing.

EXT. CITY STREET #4 - NIGHT

The Corvette slides around a corner, screams into a final

straightaway that dead ends into the sloping concrete side

of an overpass.

The cops not far behind. The Porsche bottoming out on a

bump now ant...

INT. CORVETTE - TRAVELLING - NIGHT

Alex's sun visor falls partway down from the jolt. He

reaches to push it back into position and notices...

ON THE BACK OF THE VISOR The CAR REGISTRATION. Alex takes

it out of the holder. RESUME Alex suddenly calm. He reaches

down for...

THE CIGARETTE LIGHTER pushed in. The volume on the Elvis

song pumped up. ALEX relaxes back in his seat as they scream

toward the abutment.

Alex smiles as the CIGARETTE LIGHTER pops out. He grabs it

and the GLOW vanishes as he closes his fist around it.

Erlich turns front in horror. The microsecond of terror

realized as Elvis climaxes, the retaining wall zoomes in...

EXT. OVERPASS / ABUTMENT - NIGHT

WHAM! The Corvette hits at a million mph. Crumpling,

disintegrating, and hurling two bodies bouncing off the

abutment.

THE CAVALRY - CRUISERS AND PLAINWRAPS Too late. A half

dozen cars bearing down all lights and sirens. Screeching

to a halt by what used to be a silver Porsche.  The ruptured

gas tank spurting GASOLINE.

A CRUISER screeches to a halt. Both doors fly open. Toomey

and Larkin step out. Toomey on his radio as Larkin looks

up the embankment, catches a glimpse of...

ALEX battered but alive, jerkily unclenches his fist, still

holding the Lighter, glow fading.  He tosses...

THE CIGARETTE LIGHTER arcs down onto the ex-Corvette. WIDER -

BOOM!  Cops shield themselves as the Crash scene explodes

in a huge FIREBALL that engulfs a cruiser stopped too close

by.

IN THE TOO-CLOSE COP CAR the DRIVER rams the car into

REVERSE. Tires squeal as the fireball hits and...

THE TOO-CLOSE CRUISER Engine compartment ignites, a second

fireball racing backward into another Cruiser. BOOM!

Total chaos now. LARKIN focussed on Alex, seen vaguely

through the flames. Moving toward him.

WITH LARKIN as he arrives at the top of the enbankment,

draws his weapon. Hyperalert. Alex is gone, but he finds...

ERLICH'S BODY two hundred broken boned bagged by bruises.

Larkin pulls something out of Erlich's shattered fist.

It's...

"THE LIST" Dutton and Erlich crossed off. Larkin and Toomey

yet to go, but the first letters of their names are all

contained in a VERTICAL OVAL, "DELT" circled in red.

LARKIN, AS TOOMEY JOINS HIM They give each other an oh-

shit look. Then Larkin checkes his fingertips, smeared red

from...

"THE LIST" - FLIP SIDE the CROW CIPHER, rendered thick in

coagulating blood. Illuminated by the flickering light of

the fire below.

INT. RANDALL HOUSE - ERIN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

CLOSE. A heart shaped Locket swung gently back and forth,

then closed in Erin's hand as CAW!

Erin turns, sees the Crow perched on the window ledge. As

she moves to the open window, the Crow flies off.

ERIN'S POV - OUT THE WINDOW - THE CRASH SCENE far away,

the flashing lights and sirens of fire trucks arriving to

bring the fire under control.

ERIN looks, wondering, then spots something closer to hom.

She moves off, WIPING through frame REVEALING...

ON THE FRONT LAWY Alex. He looks down now, at the front

door where...

EXT. RANDALL HOUSE - FRONT YARD - NIGHT

Erin exits the front door and we see her framed against

the huge house, a rich-man's castle built in the twenties

of quarried stone, quarter sawn oak and leaded glass.

Erin, like her sister, a child of privilege. She approaches

Alex.

Alex points at the distant crash site, the vague flashing

lights.

Erin shakes her head, trying to absorb what's going on,

then RUSHES ALEX, screaming, beating on him, fists of fury.

Alex tries to handle her flailing arms but she's too manic.

He's getting hit in the face, the chest, and it's hurting.

He grabs her roughly, gets her to stop.

He holds up a Card, the Registration from the Corvette.

He tries to give it to her one more time, then flips the

card through the air. She turns, watching its flight all

the way to the landing by the front door...

She turns back and...

He's gone. Erin walks to the door. Despite herself reaches

for the Card on the landing. It's...

THE CORVETTE REGISTRATION which we see clearly for the

first time. Owned by a company called DELT. The address is

4201 Forestview Drive.

ERIN spins around horrified, holds up the Registration.

THE ADDRESS ON THE REGISTRATION - 4201 FORESTVIEW matches

the numbers two feet away from her--the address plaque on

her own house.

INT. POLICE STATION - ROLL CALL BULLPEN - DAY

The buzz of nervous COP WALLA settles out as a stocky

SERGEANT #2, clueless but honest, raises his voice, trying

to command attention.

Walla responds "no shit"--and CAMERA BOOMS UP, moving to

the back of the room over a nervous sea of blue uniforms.

Sergeant #2 CONTINUES UNDER as CAMERA FINDS...

FAVORING LARKIN, TOOMEY AND MADDEN huddling together at

the back. Urgent whispers. Larkin and Toomey try to contain

their panic.

Larkin takes out "The List" from the crash site.

He pockets "The List." Then looks up as...

The entire room looking back at the three renegades.

Madden shakes his head like this is bad news, rises and

leaves.

INT. POLICE STATION - HALLWAY - DAY

A SECRETARY mans a LOW COUNTER guarding a large door at

the end of the huge empty hall. She's got a heavy mascara

trailer park vibe, looks up from her eyelash curler at the

sound of approaching FOOTSTEPS.

HER POV - THROUGH THE EYELASH CURLER Madden approaches.

Stops. THE SECRETARY smiles, hits a BUTTON under the

counter. The door to the Captain's office swings open.

She checks out Madden as he moves past her, then puts the

eyelash curler away in a NAILIT containing a couple of

razor sharp SCALPELS.

INT. POLICE STATION - CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - DAY

No sunlight in this cavernous, wood-panelled office. The

Captain obscure in skifts of shadow at the edge of the

room.

Madden sits.

Madden does. The Captain begins and intense slow burn.

Madden produces "The List," flips it over to show the Crow

doodle in blood.

The Captain slaps down a crime scene photo--the Crow

emblazoned huge on the top of Dutton's cruiser.

The Captain SLAMS a file down in front of Madden, who lets

things cool out a moment before looking at it.

They look up as the Secretary enters, holding the door

open, like it's time to leave. Madden starts to speak and...

The Secretary gives Madden a look as he exits, then joins

the captain who's standing...

BY AN AWARDS CASE holding glass bowls and trophies presented

to the Captain over the years for Civic Service.

The Secretary wraps her arms around him from behind as he

looks at his loot.

As he turns toward her embrace, CAMERA ADJUSTS to point up

something we may have noticed...

IN THE CASE - A STUFFED BIRD, on one of the glass shelves.

CUT TO:

EXT. RANDALL HOUSE - NIGHT

CAMERA CREEPS toward the large stone house. A light comes

on at one end of the lower floor, shining through the

window.

INT. RANDALL HOUSE - NATHAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Erin works at her father's desk under the light of an

antique floor lamp. Using a LETTER OPENER to PRY open...

A DESK DRAWER full of files. She flips through, finds a

manila file marked--DELT. Takes it out. ERIN lays the file

open on the desktop.

EMPTY. She checks...

A SMALL PAPER SHREDDER under the desk. Judging from the

paper spaghetti in the basket underneath, recently used.

ERIN scoops up the shreds of paper. No way to reassemble

this.

Erin's a terrible liar, spooked as he approaches.

She jumps up as her father reaches the desk, keeps her

distance. He spots the empty DELT folder, closes it.

No response.

Erin SCREAMS, runs out the door with her hands over her

ears. He misses a beat, then RUNS after her.

INT. RANDALL HOUSE - FRONT FOYER - NIGHT

Nathan catches up with her as she frantically grabs CAR

KEYS out of a dish by the front door.

He grabs hold of her arm, she struggles, CLAWS at his face

to get loose. Squeaks out the door onto...

EXT. RANDALL HOUSE - FRONT YARD - NIGHT

Erin runs to the far side of the big Benz, parked in the

driveway. Tries the door. The ALARM goes off.

ACROSS THE STREET, A PORCH LIGHT comes on. Erin hits a

button on the key ring, CHIRP CHIRP. It stops.

A NEIGHBOR opens the door, peers at them from across the

street. Inquisitive.

He edges away from the car, reluctantly. She starts to get

in, anger giving way to extreme sadness.

She gets in the car. Starts it. ERRRKKKK! She peels out

backward down the driveway.

SLAMS the car into Drive and tears off down the street.

The Neighbor shakes her head at Nathan, goes back inside.

INT. TENEMENT - THOMAS LEONARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

WHAM! Thomas Leonard bounces off the wall, drops to the

floor.

A FEMALE FIGURE wipes through frame, throws herself on

Larkin, who's roughing up Tommy.

Larkin backhands her sprawling to the floor, where she

crawls to the WAILING BABY, takes him in sheltering arms.

Tommy nods.

The baby's gets quieter as the mom rocks it.

Larkin helps Tommy to his feet. Places "The List" on the

table. Then RAMS Tommy's face down on top of it.

Larkin hauls Tommy back upright. Dazed.

KA-CHUNK. Toomey cycles his 9mm. Everything dead silent.

Larkin grimaces. The only question is how to end this.

EXT. TENEMENT - ALLEY - NIGHT

Madden stands by a plainwrap ,calmly SMOKING.

A SCREAM above. He looks up to see CRASH!

Tommy's BODY breaks through a window four floors up and

falls with broken glass, landing by Madden who rubs his

temple a second, then calmly grinds out the butt.

INT. TENEMENT - THOMAS LEONARD'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Tommy's wife horrified, pleading, as Toomey raises his

weapon.

Her voice stops mid-sentence as BAM.

The baby still crying as Toomey takes aim again, then lowers

his weapon, starts to leave the room with Larkin. At the

door, Toomey turns and BAM!

The crying stops.

INT. WALSH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

CLOSE. A diminished field of Chess Pieces. ADJUST to include

Walsh, scrutinizing the board.

He looks out the window a second. Then scans the room again.

Walsh goes back to the board, makes a move.

Walsh looks up. Nothing. Then Alex steps from the shadows.

Walsh looks at him a long moment, sees through the makeup.

The two guys look at each other a long moment, cross the

few steps to hug. Walsh blown away.

Walsh leans in, examines Dutton's BADGE on Alex's costume.

Walsh sits down. Disturbed.

They both turn as the Crow lands in the window, CAWS.

The Crow flies off. Walsh goes to the window and looks

out.

He turns toward Alex, who's gone. A double take as Walsh

gets it, whips around, looks out the window again. CUT TO:

EXT. REMOTE ROAD - FOREST - NIGHT

Far above a solitary car winding through an old-growth

forest, its headlights stabbing the darkness.

The Crow soars into frame, watching.

EXT. OLD GROWTH GROVE - NIGHT

A simple WOODEN CROSS illuminated by the headlights of the

Big Benz as it pulls off the road into the grove of huge

trees dripping with moss.

IN THE BENZ Erin blank as she turns off the car, leaving

the headlights on. Silence.

WITH ERIN as she steps from the car, walks toward the cross.

Partway there...

CAW! Erin looks up, finds the Crow fluttering in to perch

high overhead. Alex emerges from behind a tree, near the

cross.

She stays where she is. Alex quiet, affected by the place.

Erin's about to lose it.

She's crying softly. He draws nearer.

Seeming to lose patience, Alex lunges at her, like an

attack.

He's holding his hands over her eyes, transferring IMAGES

that shake them both.

ALEX/ERIN'S INTERNAL POV Jolting FLASHES.

A Plainwrap stops where the Mercedes is now.

A hand slams the car into Park. Doors open. Four men get

out, seen dimly, but they're Dutton, Erlich, Larkin, Toomey.

Erlich reaches back in to drag Lauren out of the back seat,

her hands cuffed in front of her.

Dutton flips up her skirt with his nightstick.

Lauren stumbles into Erlich, grabs and BAM! FLASH!

He takes a shot in the leg from his own, still holstered

weapon.

RESUME - PRESENT Erin's covering her face, like trying to

avoid seeing some horrible thing.

Alex grabs Erin, forces her to run with him, awkwardly,

like a three legged race. Tracing the path Lauren covered.

Erin stumbling as Alex pushes, cajoles her, the two of

them running toward a large tree, MATCHING to...

ALEX/ERIN'S INTERNAL POV Lauren stumbling, her cuffed hands

hindering, tree limbs hitting her face.

Her own panting subsumed in the panting of the cops on her

heels.

RESUME - PRESENT Erin still trying not to see. Alex forcing

her.

Alex spins her up against the tree and we MATCH to...

ALEX/ERIN'S INTERNAL POV Lauren an adrenaline crazed fighter

destined to lose. Her movements UNDERCRANKED, strobed.

Discontinuous and jarring.

The brutal cops overwhelm Lauren. She drops to the ground

as...

RESUME Erin drops to the forest floor, convulsed in sobs.

Alex panting. Fierce.

Off Erin, sobbing, heartbroken. Alex's fury waning as he

looks at her, wonders if he did the right thing.

EXT. GARRISON PRISON - ROOFTOP - NIGHT

Armed men and barbed wire. The Spotlight FLARES and we're...

INT. GARRISON PRISON - MORGUE HALLWAY - NIGHT

An odd foursome approaches from the far end of the hall.

Mercer escorts Madden, the Captain, and the Secretary who

hangs on her bosses arm, gawking like a tourist.

They all enter...

INT. GARRISON PRISON - MORGUE - NIGHT

Mercer goes to the locker where he left Alex.

The all look inside. The locker is empty. Mercer's the

only one shocked. He noisily opens and shuts the other

lockers looking for Alex.

Mercer stops, backs off, gives the power trio some space.

They watch now as the Secretary moves, drawn to the mirror.

She's looking at... T

HE FRACTURED MIRROR. Shards of glass selectively removed

forming, we see now, a CROW.

Madden turns, not comfortable with the concept.

The Secretary nestles into the Captain, who whispers in

her ear. He nods.

EXT. OLD GROWTH GROVE - NIGHT

WIDE. Erin sits cross-legged in the HEADLIGHTS of the Benz.

Alex perches Crow-like on the hood.

He closes his eyes. Pained at a memory.

She fights back tears. Gains strength.

Erin nods, takes the Locket off her neck.

She winds up to toss the Locket away and Alex hops down

off the hood. Stops her. Takes the Locket. ALEX

He fastens the Locket back around her neck. A covenant.

CLOSE. Erin pulls some makeup out of her jacket pocket.

Dumps it on the ground. Finds a pot of dark eyeshadow among

the containers.

Erin's face blasted WHITE by HEADLIGHTS.

She closes her eyes as Alex begins the first bold lines

around her eyes and for a moment in the gauzy white light,

she could be...

LAUREN opens her eyes a second, smiles, shuts them again.

WIDER. Alex paints Erin's face in the Benz headlights, the

two of them kneeling in the forest-cathedral.

Camera creeps BACKWARD, leaving the two of them connected

by ritual. And touch. And a promise to each other.

INT. RANDALL'S HOUSE - NATHAN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

CLOSE. A mess of documents. Nathan nervously writing,

assembling a tell-all at his desk.

Nathan gets up. Tries to subtly herd the Captain off.

The Captain circles to the desk now, past Nathan.

The Captain flips through some of the papers on the desk.

Frowns. He closes a file folder.

Nathan furious. The Captain keeps a preternatural calm.

This catches Nathan off guard. He starts to say something.

The Captain flips through the papers on the desk again.

EXT. RANDALL HOUSE - FRONT YARD - NIGHT

HEADLIGHTS approach from down the street. The Big Benz

pulls into the empty driveway.

Erin alone in the car, her mood tough to judge in the Crow

mask.

INT. RANDALL HOUSE - FRONT FOYER - NIGHT

Erin enters, steels herself. Then she calls out...

INT. RANDALL HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

UNDERWATER. Erin plunges her masked face into the wash

basin in this white-tiled bathroom.

ANGLE - ERIN A few SLO-MO DROPLETS cascade off her face

into basin as she scrutinizes herself in the mirror, wipes

off the mask.

CAMERA INCHING forward...

She listens up. Grabs a Towel to blot the water on her

face. We begin to hear with her...

DRIP. DRIP. DRIP...

She tightens the sink faucets. The sound continues DRIP

DRIP as she moves to...

THE CLAWFOOT BATHTUB Faucet not dripping, but the sound is

louder. DRIP DRIP. Erin grabs the shower curtain, whips it

back REVEALING...

NATHAN RANDALL behind the tub, face a mask of gore, blown

off point blank by the BLOODY HANDGUN on the tile next to

him. ERIN screams.

INT. WALSH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

CLOSE. The Chess set. A few pieces moved off the board

now. Alex not looking at it. He's looking at the picture

of himself and Lauren taped in the lid of the Chess box.

Alex picks up the BLACK KING.

Alex places the picture of himself with Lauren back in the

box of chess pieces, against the open lid.

BAM BAM BAM.

They look up. A shadow banging on the door. Leaving BLOODY

SMEARS on the outside of the frosted glass.

Walsh opens the door and Erin enters, wild and blood

smeared, remnants of the Crow mask around her eyes.

It all catches up with her now, the flight, the exhaustion.

She throws herself into his arms.

Alex immobilized by this. He turns to Walsh.

Alex waiting for an address. Finally...

Alex turns to her, comforting. Holds her face in his hands.

He heads off and we PRE-LAP sexbomb death metal POUNDING...

CUT TO:

INT. "THE HOLE" - NIGHT

More debauched than our previous visit. Darker, more

crowded.

Patrons propositioned in front of our eyes by girls barely

eighteen. The room writhing.

ON THE MAINSTAGE the "Cop" strippers we saw before, but

dangerous seeming, as they pantomime an interrogation, a

handcuffed "perp" manhandled between them.

AT THE ENTRANCE Alex blows past people waiting to get in,

creating enough disturbance that TWO BOUNCERS greet him.

The Two Bouncers give each other a look. One points to a

SIGN on the wall: "You must be 21..."

The Other Bouncer grabs Alex as he pushes past. Alex heaves

him into the line of WAITING PATRONS.

As they go down like dominoes... the First Bouncer pulls a

GUN.

As Alex starts off... BAM! He's blown back by a shot half

lost in the noisy club. No panic yet.

ONSTAGE the strippers break character, looking. The audience

turns as...

NEAR THE ENTRANCE The First Bouncer goes flying above the

heads of the crowd, getting off a dramatic SHOT while

airborne, inducing...

PANDEMONIUM Patrons stampeding as BAM BAM!  Alex taking

bullets, the miracle lost in the chaotic exit. The Bouncers

out of sight underfoot.

ON ALEX visible again, back on his feet. Buffeted,

stationary as everyone flees. With the exodus still at

flood stage...

INT. WALSH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

ON WALSH, in motion as he puts on a jacket, throws some

papers into a briefcase. He's nervous, ill-suited for this

cloak and dagger stuff, chattering...

She's looking elsewhere, at the door that has quietly

opened. The Captain stands there. Somber reptile. Holding

a sheaf of papers in one hand.

She stares at him expressionless.

She talks with great difficulty.

She nods.

He takes a step toward her. She pulls out the Blood Pistol.

Seems crazy enough to use it.

The Captain stops, gently tosses the sheaf of papers toward

her, onto Walsh's desk.

The papers Nathan was preparing. Walsh looks at them

while...

Erin has one eye on the papers now, recognizes her dad's

hand. The Captain inches forward.

The Captain steps forward, right to the desk. Erin backed

into a corner now.

She holds a hand out for the note, taking her eye off the

situation for one second as she reads...

THE NOTE A bunch of numbers added together in her father's

hand. Not a suicide note.

THE CAPTAIN grabs Erin's wrist and BAM!

A chunk of the ceiling falls as the weapon discharges. The

Captain throws her in a chokehold, her finger still on the

trigger.

She fights as the Captain wraps his own hand over hers,

wrestles her arm toward Walsh, in the sights now. BAM!

WALSH blown backward, collapsing by the Chess Board. Trying

to pull himself up. Erin struggling. As...

MADDEN enters from the hall, in a hurry, gun drawn.

He nods toward Walsh, who is moving, barely.

BAM. A shot from Madden drops Walsh for god. As Madden

drags Walsh toward the door, the Captain grabs...

THE PICTURE OF ALEX AND LAUREN pulled off the lid of the

Chess box, one of the pieces of tape left behind. The

Captain exits.

INT. "THE HOLE" - NIGHT

MUSIC STILL POUNDS, lights swirl. But the club has cleared

out, leaving human detritus, a handful of casualties from

the stampede.

WITH ALEX as he steps over the Two Bouncers, expired on

the floor.

A soft WHIMPERING marks the silence.  The girl cuffed

onstage. Alex goes up to the terrified girl.

Close up, she looks way underage. He gathers her clothes,

spots a key on the floor.

She listens as he unlocks the cuffs.

He watches as she hightails it out the front door, still

half naked. As she leaves...

THE CROW appears in the doorway near the broken bodies.

Alex takes a deep breath, as if it hurts.

The casualties. CAW. The Crow flies on, disappearing into

the back rooms. Alex turns, follows...

INT. "THE HOLE" - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

Alex moves past the empty makeup table. A lipstick cigarette

smolders in an ashtray. People left in a hurry. MUSIC LOUD,

as if inside our heads now. Alex continues...

INT. "THE HOLE" - INTERNET PORN FACILITY

Nobody home. Empty images refreshed every six seconds.

Number of hits static now. Alex drawn now by the "No

Admittance" Curtain which he approaches slowly, touching

it and FLASH!

ALEX'S INTERNAL POV - LAUREN looking over her shoulder,

pulling back the "No Admittance" Curtain, going where she

shouldn't go.

Lauren makes her stealthy way into....

INT. "THE HOLE" - BACK HALL - NIGHT

revealed as Alex slips past the Curtain, retracing Lauren's

footsteps. CAMERA FOLLOWS Alex CREEPING down the hall to...

ALEX'S INTERNAL POV - LAUREN down the hall, peering inside

the partially open Back Room door, then turning back

startled TOWARD CAMERA as if suddenly overtaken.

AT THE DOOR Alex turns back, like Lauren, looks behind

him. The hallway is empty. He enters...

INT. "THE HOLE" - BACK ROOM - NIGHT

Darkness. As Alex gropes for a lightswitch, a LIGHTER

FLARES. Toomey and Larkin lean in, light up in synch.

Alex takes in the dark fringes, dim reflections off lots

of eyes. Not taxidermy specimens.

BAM BAM BAM BAM.

A dozen police officers lining the walls empty cartridges

into Alex in an angry, STROBING fusillade. In the silence

that follows...

The gang LAUGHS. Larkin makes his way to a light switch by

the door.

Larkin flips on the low-watt BARE BULBS hanging down past

industrial pipes and conduit, casting a dim light on the

cinderblock space.

NO ALEX.

They look up and... BAM! Alex DROPS LARKIN with a shot to

the forehead. BAM!

He MISSES TOOMEY as bullets from below EXPLODE all around

him. Alex scampers across framing as...

The BARE BULBS burst, all but one, plunging us back in to

near darkness as Alex drops to the ground near Larkin's

fallen body. Jacks up the sleeve. No scar. Alex spots

Toomey, rolls out as...

THREE COPS pump rounds into Alex. BAM!

Alex takes the middle Cop out, a TOONEY-LIKE GUY who falls

onto Toomey, behind him. ALEX turns, forced to defend

himself as FULL AUTO FIRE breaks open, the other flank,

more advancing cops. While...

TOOMEY crawls out from under the fallen copy, then backs

out the door on hands and knees while...

A FINAL EXPLOSIVE FUSILLADE leaves only Alex standing. As

the echoes dissolve...

Alex Alex moves to where Toomey was, bends down to check

the body...

THE NAMEPLATE - "TOOMEY" But the pin isn't fastened

properly.

The badge askew. RESUME - ALEX rolls the body over, finds

another nameplate underneath. "Hauser."  Heads off in search

of...

INT - "THE HOLE" - INTERNET PORN FACILITY - NIGHT

Toomey is clearing the "No Admittance" curtain when...

Toomey panics as he approaches...

INTERNET FANTASY SETS Monitors still updating every six

seconds. Toomey hears Alex coming, slips through the

"Dungeon."

BEHIND THE SHOWER FANTASY SET Toomey takes refuge out of

sight, next to a GAS HOT WATER HEATER, quiet as a mouse.

ALEX tears the "No Admittance" curtain completely off its

rod, arriving at the fantasy sets just in time to see...

THE DUNGEON MONITOR Toomey (frozen) scurrying through.

Gone now as the monitor updates. Then Alex appears,

following him through the set...

WITH ALEX moving to the rear of the "dungeon," on Toomey's

heels. WAM. Toomey hits him full force with A PIPE, sending

Alex sprawling backward, COLLAPSING the flimsy Shower set.

WAM. Toomey swings again, misses Alex, but connects with...

THE GAS LINE to the water heater ripped out by the blow.

HISS. The sound of gas, loud, as the line breaks.

RESUME Alex straddles Toomey, just as Toomey manages to

get his gun pointed in Alex's face. Hissing gas nearby.

CLICK. Toomey cocks the gun.

WAM! Alex swings Toomey's pipe HARD at a much bigger GAS

LINE right behind the gas heater, leaving it badly cracked.

The hiss magnified 100% nos.

Alex jacks Toomey's sleeve down. No Scar. Alex pissed as

Toomey locks eyes with him. Really seeing him now.

We pick up...

INT. "THE HOLE" - BACK ROOM - NIGHT

Some light filters in as a door opens to the outside. A

FIGURE enters, squats among the bodies. He leans in, closes

larkin's eyes, and we see...

It's Madden. Blood on his hands. He hears Alex's VOICE

faintly, then Toomey cries out in pain. Madden moves

toward...

INT. "THE HOLE" - INTERNET PORN FACILITY - NIGHT

Madden creeps down the hallway to the back room. VOICES

growing louder.

As Madden moves toward the conversation, his face registers

the slightest of smiles.

MADDEN'S CREEPING POV MONITORS obliquely visible as he

reaches the end of the hall by the Fantasy sets. The

"Shower" monitor shows Alex and Toomey, visible through

the trashed set, updated every six seconds.

MADDEN SNIFFS gas. The HISS now audible along with Alex's

voice. Madden smiles. Pulls out his 9mm.

And BACKS UP, away from the Fantasy Sets toward the back

room. Madden takes aim at...

THE FIRST MONITOR The images is Alex threatening Toomey.

Updating now--LOSING ALEX on the Monitor as he steps into

frame in person, looks up and BAM!

CROWVISION a speeding bullet passes narrowly by and...

ANGLE - GROUND ZERO as the bullet hits the monitor in a

shower of sparks, followed by...

BOOM! A ROILING FIREBALL Seems to vaporize Alex before

flying down the hallway right at CAMERA.

Madden manages a couple steps in retreat before it blows

him into the back room with a deafening roar.

EXT. "THE HOLE" - INFERNO - NIGHT

BOOM! Windows blow out in a gas fired inferno. A body flung

out the rear door. BOOM!

EXT. "THE HOLE" - NIGHT

Interior/exterior being less meaningful than seconds ago.

Walls crumbled, roof blown off.

BRIGHT FIRE consumes the frame, consumes the bodies of

downed cops, consumes every last bit of oxygen and life.

Distant SIRENS draw closer.

A SLOW SCAN, someone's OBSTRUCTED POV of Hell.

INCLUDE ALEX watching from under a collapsed cinderblock

wall that offers some protection from the flames, if not

the heat. He looks, intent now, spotting...

THE ARM WITH THE ZIGZAG SCARIFICATION sticking out of the

rubble, murky through the flames, growing clearer as camera

PUSHES, flames licking at it...

ALEX tries to move toward the arm. Forced back by too-

intense flame as another beam falls, the rubble shifts

and...

THE ARM WITH THE ZIGZAG SCARIFICATION skeletal now, baked

down to bones. A dozen short metal rods on the ground under

it. He picks a few up. THE CAPTAIN drawn now to...

UNDER THE RUBBLE - WHERE ALEX WAS water dripping off the

concrete, collecting in the place where Alex hid. But he's

long gone. The Captain drops the rods. Satisfied it's over.

EXT. CITY STREET #5 - NIGHT

Alex staggers along in bad shape. Up ahead...

A GIRL in her twenties exits a building down a flight of

stairs, waits at the bottom for her BOYFRIEND, who's locking

the door. She sees Alex, gives him an empathetic look.

Alex walks slowly closer.

ALEX'S INTERNAL POV Lauren appearing to him, playing their

game. But the words are wrong, distorted.

Her Bruce Lee "Oooo" a siren call. RESUME Alex moving slowly

forward on the street, drawn toward the girl who watches

with horrified fascination.

ALEX'S INTERNAL POV

Lauren and Alex drawing very close now when... RESUME WAM.

A FIST clocks Alex in the face, dropping him hard onto the

pavement.

ALEX'S POV

The Guy wraps his arm protectively around the girl, walks

her off. Running into a COP at the next intersection. They

POINT at...

ALEX takes off, ducking into an alley. Confused.

CAMERA CREEPS BACKWARD as he gathers his thoughts.

INT. WALSH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

RATTLE RATTLE. Alex's shadow visible through the frosted

glass, jostling the locked door.

SMASH. His arm PUNCHES through the glass, turn the knob.

Alex enters, arm bleeding badly. He yanks a large piece of

glass from his flesh. Painful.

Alex registers that the rules have changed. He finds a

necktie of Walsh's, uses it to bind the wound, staunch the

flow. He scans the room again looking for...

Something. But everything seems ok. He passes...

The Chess Box, the picture of Lauren and Alex gone. Just a

piece of TAPE left, sticking to the top of the open lid.

OVER THE CHESS BOARD - ALEX the missing pic lost on him,

drawn to the chess board where Walsh collapsed. Something

wrong with the game. He finds...

THE BLACK KING Off the board. On top of a stack of news

clippings lying on the floor.

Alex picks it up, LEAVING a RING OF BLOOD under.

CAMERA PUSHES on the clipping underneath, the headline

"City Leaders Vow Crackdown in Wake of Randall Murder."

PUSHING, finding among the City Leaders...

THE CAPTAIN'S FACE circled in blood. Camera continues to

PUSH on the grainy newsprint, through it, until all we see

are halftone pixels and the picture loses meaning.

EXT. CITY - AIRBORNE - NIGHT

The Police Station in sinister CROWVISION as we approach,

swoop in and...

INT. POLICE STATION - HALLWAY

Alex walks the long approach to the Captain's office, past

the empty Secretary's desk. KICKING the door open CRASH!

into...

INT. POLICE STATION - CAPTAIN'S OFFICE

The Captain works alone at his desk under a standing lamp.

Looks up unconcerned as Alex enters, walks to the desk,

and SLAPS down the ring-of-blood clipping.

The Captain rises.

Alex tenses as the Captain starts toward him.

Alex draws the knife from his clothes.

Enraged, Alex SWIPES the knife. The Captain grabs his arm

right at the blood soaked necktie, squeezes hard. Alex

writhes in pain. In each other's faces now.

THE KNIFE starting to fall from Alex's hand as the Captain

continues to clamp down on his wound.

The Captain snatches the knife, RAMS it into Alex's midriff.

FLASH

EXT. OLD GROWTH GROVE - DAY

ALEX'S INTERNAL POV Lauren in tears in Alex's car.

RESUME

INT. POLICE STATION - CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

WHOOMP. Another stab into Alex. There will be fifty three.

FLASH ALEX'S INTERNAL POV Alex back at the inferno, cowering

from flames.

RESUME The Captain full of righteous conviction.

The Captain bent over Alex, stabbing him.

ALEX'S INTERNAL POV (INTERCUT WITH PREVIOUS)

FLASHES move us backward along the path we've taken so

far, a tour of hell on earth, the blast of infernal winds

and the ever-present voice of the Captain, condemning.

Strippers writhe at "The Hole."

The Porsche explodes.

Alex blasts Dutton. BAM!

Alex escapes the taser. Mercer drops.

Time SCREECHING to a halt, all the movement converging on

a single, quiet image. One we've seen before...

Alex in the chair. But his last words are different.

ZAP. Electro-spasm as the switch is thrown. No scar, no

meltdown, just violent fibrillations that moderate, finally

as we MATCH TO...

RESUME - THE CAPTAIN'S OFFICE The Captain shaking Alex,

holding something in front of Alex's face.

Alex's eye's gone dead, no longer seeing...

THE PHOTO - LAUREN AND ALEX IN THE WOODS arms around each

other. Familiar, but on second take, it's like the crime

scene photos...

Lauren's NECK is SLASHED, her body riddled with stab wounds.

Alex has a big smile on his face, his arm around her, her

head on his shoulder. 100% sociopath. RESUME

The Captain drops Alex lifeless and bloody to the floor.

Only the sound of the Captain panting now, then...

The sound of slow clapping. Madden walks into the room

from behind perimeter curtains.

CLAP CLAP CLAP.

Madden kicks Alex lightly, nudging him. No life signes.

The Captain rips the picture in two. Tosses it in the trash.

INT. MYSTERY ROOM - NIGHT

NEW ANGLE - THROUGH A WINDOW DARKLY Madden and the Captain

grab Alex, one at each end.

REVEAL, this is the Secretary's POV through the window.

She's bent over someone's toes, painting them BLUE.

WIDE. The Mystery Room revealed. Taxidermy specimens line

the wall and the table.

Erin stands in PROFILE in the middle of the room, strangely

silent, hands tied overhead by a rope that runs to the

ceiling.

The Secretary brushing polish on Erin's toes.

The Secretary applies a last flourish of polish, then

stands, kisses Erin gently.

The Secretary moves off REVEALING...

ERIN'S FACE MOUTH SEWN shut in a rough zigzag stitch, like

the scar. Her eyes dart as...

THE DOOR opens. The Captain and Madden carry Alex in. Madden

sweeps the TAXIDERMY SPECIMENS back with his hand, clearing

a space for Alex on the table. Among them...

THE CROW on its Corvus Brachyrhynchos stand takes a small

hop backward, this sign of life unnoticed as...

RESUME WHUMP. Alex heaved onto the table.

The Secretary puts her ear to Alex's lifeless lips.

This reminds him... he looks at the Crow on the stand.

Lifeless, stuffed. As it should be.

The Secretary steps off to grab thekit, leaving Alex's

lifeless open eyes pointing toward Erin, reflected in his

eyeballs first before...

ANGLE - ERIN looking up at her own hands, bound above her

as she eases them apart and...

The HEART SHAPED LOCKET slips from between her palms and

she closes them again in time to catch the chain, the locket

swinging.

ON THE TABLE X-CLOSE. The locket reflected in Alex's

lifeless open eyes a second before...

The Secretary returns, blocking the sightline. Lays out

the Kit, nasty looking tools left over from the Inquisition.

Then unbuttons Alex's tattered shirt, undressing him for

the procedure.

Stab wounds everywhere.

A large KNIFE, the Lauren murder weapon, angles in at the

base of Alex'sneck where the Secretary's head was.

THE CROW - OVERCRANKED moves on the table. Takes flight.

THE TRIO turn toward the commotion.

THE LOCKET - OVERCRANKED Snatched in midair by the Crow

from Erin's praying hands.

FLASH!  ALEX/CROW'S INTERNAL POV HIGH ANGLE CROWVISION.

Dim memories from the woods. Anamorphic and dark.

Two figures--Alex and Erin--kneeling. RESUME - THE LOCKET

released from the Crow's beak, passing through the TRIO'S

HANDS uncaught, bouncing off Alex onto the table, in front

of his open eyes.

ALEX/CROW'S INTERNAL POV FLASH. AT GROUND LEVEL. Alex

fastens the LOCKET around her neck. The distortion

lessening, becoming Alex's POV.

FLASH.

FLASH. Alex painting her face.

RESUME Alex BLINKS. The Captain reacts--oh shit--starts to

bring the knife down, a hurried strike at Alex's chest.

WAM! Alex grabs the Captain's arm in his hand, stopping

the movement on a dime.

MADDEN pulls a gun, points it at Erin. ALEX jumps up, flying

INTO the gun as it goes off.

CRASH! They tumble THROUGH THE WINDOW into the Captain's

office while...

THE CAPTAIN cuts down the rope holding Erin. She

collapses...

ON THE TABLE strewn with blades, secreting one between her

hands, in the second before...

THE CAPTAIN drags Erin off. The Secretary flails at the

Crow with a metal ROD, while...

IN THE CAPTAIN'S OFFICE Madden has the gun on Alex now.

BAM! No effect. BAM!

Madden sweating it now, continuing to shoot with no effect

as...

THE MYSTERY ROOM The Secretary finally connects with the

Crow, batting it against the wall, noticing this coincides

with...

Alex goes flying against the desk, winged himself. Madden

c Onfused, not understanding.

Madden wheels, points the gun through the busted-out picture

window into...

The SECRETARY dives for cover as bullets explode around

her. The Crow dancing, sprayed with debris.

INT. POLICE STATION - ELEVATOR - NIGHT

CLOSE. Floor lights sequence above the door, heading for

underground parking.

"5 - 4 - 3..." The Captain watches the lights. Erin is

slumped face first against the side of the elevator opposite

him.

ON ERIN face pressed against the elevator wall, intent.

Erin winces, looks down...

THE BLADE emerging from her sleeve as she tries to hold it

with her two bound hands. DING. The elevator jerks to a

stop.

THE CAPTAIN grabs her off the floor and she RAMS the blade

into his abdomen with the force of the entire body. Twists

it. The elevator doors open.

ERIN pulls out the blade, claws her way out the door, the

Captain hanging on to her, finally getting free as she

swipes at him again, drawing fresh blood. Running now,

into...

INT. POLICE STATION - PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT

Erin stumbles between cars in the dark underground garage,

cutting the cord off her hands, leaving it behind as...

Behind her, the Captain unsteady on his feet, a wounded

animal. He pulls out a GLOCK 9MM and KA-CHUNK. Cycles it.

Erin dives between cars, scrambling on hands and knees.

Looks around.

HER POV - SCANNING a small garage with a few police cruisers

by a SERVICE AREA and no people. A barred GATE over the

exit. No way out.

ERIN winces. Then stifles a cry as she cuts the stitches

off her mouth with the knife. Drops the threads on the

floor and moves off...

INT. POLICE STATION - CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Alex runs past the glass AWARDS CASE, takes a flying leap

behind the desk, seeking cover as Madden empties a clip at

him.

The slide ratchets back. Madden SLAMS another clip in,

advances on Alex, hidden behind the shredded desk as...

THE SECRETARY clears stuffed birds off the table trying to

expose the wounded crow cowering back against the wall.

WHOP! She grabs it, the Crow flapping desperately as...

IN THE CAPTAIN'S OFFICE Madden creeps up on the desk, peers

over it. Nothing. Out of nowhere...

WAM!  Alex rushes Madden, bulldozing him across the room

with a pained cry of brute force toward...

THE AWARDS CASE CRASH! Glass shatters as Alex hurls Madden,

who swivels around in time to get off a last shot BAM!

That collapses Alex to the floor.

IN THE MYSTERY ROOM The Crow squeezes out of the Secretary's

grasp, leaving her holding a couple feathers.

AT THE AWARD'S CASE Alex hauls himself off the floor as

the Crow joins him. Seeing...

MADDEN'S HEAD has taken its place among glass bowls and

trophies, half decapitated by the glass shelf it now rests

on. Down the shelf from the stuffed bird. ALEX rushes

through the blown out window into...

Seeing for the first time that Erin is gone, the rope

hanging from the ceiling, finding...

THE SECRETARY

Alex eases the Secretary to her feet with a hand around

her neck, her back to the wall. She looks UP, smiling at...

WALSH - RIGHT ARM MISSING hangs high overhead from some

kind of hook. His arm has been crudely removed.

Underneath him, on the table, a BOX of 2" surgical stainless

steel rods sits by a pool of blood. ALEX yells, reeling,

as...

The door flies open. A half dozen cops in, all targeting

Alex as...

THE SECRETARY plunges the Lauren KNIFE in Alex's back. He

spins violently THROWING her HARD against the wall. WAM!

Surprise!-she sticks. REVEAL, she's impaled on ANTELOPE

ANTLERS, hanging off the wall. Her head drops, looking

down as a stream of blood flows down her legs, drips off

her toes...

BAM BAM BAM. The new arrivals open fire. Alex reaches over

his shoulder, yanks out the knife with an odd slurping

sound as...

INT. POLICE STATION - PARKING GARAGE

The sound of GUNFIRE filters down from above as the Captain

hunts his hidden prey. He stops, studies...

ERIN'S POV - LOW ANGLE LOOKING UNDER A CAR The Captain's

feet, joined by his hand as he picks up the thread she

left on the ground.

INCLUDE ERIN

The Captain's feet have moved off. Where? She listens,

hears nothing. Slips off...

NEW ANGLE - ERIN takes refuge in the service area, crouching

behind stacks of TIRES. Knife at the ready.

The Captain's FOOTSTEPS audible.

HER OBSTRUCTED POV between stacks of tires, the Captain,

Glock at ready, PASSES BY, moving out of sight. Footsteps

RECEDING. Then silent.

ERIN Listening, neurons firing.  Cranes her neck to see.

Nothing. WIDER the Captain appears BEHIND ERIN, over the

stacks of tires. She's oblivious, then...

Erin wheels, slashes across his wrist. The Glock falls,

Erin grabs it, levels it at the Captain. Her finger tense

on the trigger.

BAM! She pulls the trigger, simultaneously wrenching the

gun, aiming just enough off that...

THE CAPTAIN yells in pain, rushes his hand to his ear, a

bloody mess. He starts advancing again toward her and Erin

pulls...

THE TRIGGER again, again, again. No click, no blast.

NOTHING.

RESUME the Captain takes the gun from her. Shows her the

CLIP he's carrying in his hand. Slams it into the gun.

Erin SCREAMS as he drags her off now and...

INT. MYSTERY ROOM - NIGHT

THE CROW flies UP toward the small entry window. Alex

follows, bullets exploding around him as he hauls himself

up toward the windowledge.

EXT. POLICE STATION - ROOFTOP

ERRRKKK. The SOUND of a car in a hurry audible as Alex

hauls himself out the small window. Runs to the edge,

spotting...

FAR BELOW a dark sedan leaving in a rush, wrapping around

the corner of the police station now.

INT. DARK SEDAN - TRAVELLING FAST - NIGHT

The Captain nervous at the wheel. He looks over his

shoulder...

Erin's in the back seat, cuffed to the door handle.

INT. POLICE STATION - MYSTERY ROOM

The Sergeant and crew utterly speechless taking in the

carnage.

He looks up, where Alex vanished. Starts to climb.

EXT. POLICE STATION - ROOFTOP - NIGHT

Alex dashes over the articulated roof, trying to keep in

sight...

HIS MOVING POV partially obstructed, of the sedan below.

Speeding around another corner now...

ALEX alters course to cut the sedan off, jumping up onto a

PARAPET where he totters over the vertical face as the

sedan turning onto the street below.

THE SERGEANT AND CREW emerge on the roof. Acquire target

Alex Corvis.

WITH ALEX as he takes a flying dive off the building,

intercepting...

EXT. POLICE STATION - STREET #

The Dark Sedan careening up the street leaving the city.

WAM!

INT. DARK SEDAN - TRAVELLING - NIGHT

WAM! ERRRK! The Captain nearly jumps out of his skin, barely

keeping control.

Erin perks up in the back seat. Battered. Ever hopeful.

EXT. CITY STREETS #6 - DARK SEDAN

WIDE. As the speeding car passes under a streetlight, we

see a HUMAN FIGURE standing on top of it, legs spread,

arms upstretched.

PUNCH IN... CLOSE. The Figure, Alex, strikes downward,

right THROUGH the glass moonroof.

CRASH!  IN THE SEDAN the Captain horrified as Alex's hand

yanks his own right off the wheel and up, through the

moonroof...

ON THE ROOF OF THE SEDAN Alex kneels now, holding the

Captain's arm up as he jacks the sleeve down exposing...

THE ZIGZAG PATTERN, THE MORTIFIED FLESH held in Alex's

hand like the trophy it is.

INT. GARRISON'S PRISON - EXECUTION CHAMBER - NIGHT

Alex's voice appears. Calm. Unhurried.

FIND ALEX'S FACE in the darkness. Moving as he performs

some unseen task. Intent, focussed.

FIND ERIN, in the darkness, listening to Alex's voice.

She touches her mouth, little drops of dried blood where

the wounds are already healing.

SLOW FADE IN as our eyes adjust to the dim light.

We're in the death chamber. Dark. Claustrophobic.

The only light a few panel indicators and spill from the

door open from the adjacent observation room to the outside.

Alex looks at the phone on the wall. Silent.

REVEAL the Captain in the chair. A private execution. Erin

slumped along a side wall. Totally inscrutable. Intense.

A long beat of silence.

A Figure wipes through frame moving toward the switch. The

Captain's voice rising as he senses time running out.

CLOSE. The switch thrown. ZZZZZTTT. PAN UP off the switch

to...

She glances at the Captain, fibrillating in the chair,

starts to move off. Then stops, near Alex, looking with

him at...

THEIR POV - THE ZIGZAG SCAR fibrillating, as we PUSH into

seething detail.

Writhing bodies, human suffering, a hellish miasma that

draws us in until we turn our heads away, released.

EXT. GARRISON PRISON - WITNESS ENTRANCE - DAWN

Alex and Erin exit the visitor's entrance, met by the Crow

and the first rays of morning light.

He puts his arm around her and she places her hand over

his.

He stops, face to face now.

For a split second, she's...

LAUREN Smiling. Sublime. She kisses him. As the break off,

it's...

ERIN AGAIN She hangs on a long moment before letting go.

Then she spots something...

ON THE GROUND - A SIGN carried by one of the protestors.

"Remember the Victim." With a picture of Lauren. Someone

has written a bold "s" after it. "Remember the Victims."

ERIN picks up the sign.

She turns to Alex. But he's gone. She tries to keep it

together as...

CAMERA BOOMS up leaving her alone outside the prison walls,

with her memories, and her conscience, and her hopes, which

is alot.

As a DUSTDEVIL whips up in the parking lot, she drops the

sign, and starts to CRY.

INT. MYSTERY ROOM - DAWN

CAMERA FINDS Walsh, laid out on the table now, missing arm

mercifully away from us. The CROW alights nearby, something

in its beak.

The Crow flaps off, REVEALING the WHITE KING, laid by

Walsh's head. CAMERA keeps MOVING, FINDING..

The Crow, on the stand marked Corvis Brachyrhynchos, stuffed

and mute.

Its eyes blink a last time, then are motionless.

EXT. CEMETARY - LAUREN AND ALEX'S GRAVES

X-CLOSE. JOURNAL. A not-too-loopy feminine hand, writing

the words we are hearing.

REVEAL... Erin is writing the journal, but she's a radically

transformed wild child.

A shock of vividly colored dreadlocks, some of the holes

that stitched her mouth shut kept permanently open by studs.

She's leaning up against a new headstone.

"Alex Corvis 1981-1999 Always With Us."

Erin stops writing, closes the journal, stands. She takes

the Locket off her neck, drapes it over Alex's headstone,

like the one already over Lauren's.

She stares at the two a moment, then puts her index finger

to her lips, transfers kisses to the two stones. And leaves.

THE END
