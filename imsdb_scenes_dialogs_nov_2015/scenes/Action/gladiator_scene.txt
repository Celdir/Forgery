FADE IN:

EXT.  FOREST - DAY

Germania.  The far reaches of the Roman Empire.

Winter 180 A.D.

Incongruously enough, the first sound we hear is a

beautiful tenor voice.  Singing.  A boy's voice.

CREDITS as we hear the haunting song float through dense

forests.  We finally come to a rough, muddy road slashing

through the forest.  On the road a GERMAN PEASANT FATHER

is herding along three sickly looking cows.  His two SONS

are with him.  His youngest son sits on one of the cows

and sings a soft, plaintive song.

They become aware of another sound behind them on the road

-- the creak of wood, the slap of metal on leather.  The

Father immediately leads his cattle and his sons off the

road.  They stand-still, eyes down:  the familiar posture

of subjugated peoples throughout history.

A wagon train rumbles past them.  Three ornate wagons

followed by a mounted cohort of fifty heavily-armed

PRAETORIAN GUARDS.

The young boy dares to glance up at the passing Romans.

His eyes burn with hatred.

INT.  WAGON - DAY

Mist momentarily obscures a man's face.  Frozen breath.

The man is in his 20's, imperious and handsome.  He is

swathed in fur, only his face exposed.  He is COMMODUS.

He glances up.

The woman across from him returns his gaze evenly.  She is

slightly older, beautiful and patrician.  A formidable

woman.

She is LUCILLA.

A beat.  Their breath turns instantly to mist.

She arches an eyebrow.

A beat.

The wagon rumbles to a halt.  Voices are heard outside.

Commodus leaps out...

EXT.  WAGON - OUTPOST - DAY

Three Roman SOLDIERS guard an outpost, a watchtower, on

the roadside.

Commodus tosses off his furs -- beneath them he wears a

beautiful set of Lorica Segmentata -- the traditional

formed armor of Rome.  He moves to a horse as:

He leaps onto the horse and canters back to the Praetorian

Guard unit.

Soldier #2 climbs on his horse and leads them.  Commodus

rides off with most of the Praetorian Guard unit.

Lucilla peeks her head from the wagon.  She glances at the

remaining soldiers.  Distinctly unpromising.

EXT.  HILL - TWILIGHT

The mighty catapults dwarf the humans.  Soldiers from the

elite Felix Regiment -- a legion of the Roman Army -- haul

the monstrous machines up a hill.

The commanding General of the Felix Regiment, MAXIMUS,

walks between two of the catapults.  He is a striking and

intense man in his 30's.  Like all the soldiers who

surround him, he is caked with mud and exhausted.

He trudges up the hill with his two lieutenants, TITUS and

QUINTUS.

They have reached the top of the hill.  Stunning martial

preparations are underway.  The catapults join ten others.

Archers are taking up position.  Brutal "Scorpions" --

devices for firing multiple crossbow bolts -- are being

loaded.  Soldiers are also loading the catapults with

enormous "Greek fire pots" -- large, round terra cotta

pots.

Maximus and his lieutenants gaze down from the hilltop.

Below them they can see a German encampment.

A beat as Maximus gazes down at the German position.

A beat.

A beat as he gazes down at the enemy.

EXT.  TREES - TWILIGHT

Maximus and Titus are on their horses, the cavalry of two

hundred Felix Regiment warriors surrounds them.  Steam

flares from their horses' nostrils.  They wait in a thick

stand of trees -- the German position can be seen across a

muddy plain.

A large wolf -- "The Wolf of Rome" -- waits at Maximus'

side.

Maximus nods to an archer.  The archer lights the tip of

an arrow and sends it flaming into the night sky.

EXT.  HILLTOP - TWILIGHT

Quintus waits.  The catapults are loaded and waiting.  So

too the Scorpions.  So too the 200 archers of the Felix

Regiment.

He sees the flaming arrow flying up from below.

The mighty catapults are released.  The Greek fire pots

arc dramatically through the air.  A moment later soldiers

release the Scorpions and hundreds of bolts streak through

the sky.  The archers fire a murderous barrage of flaming

arrows.

EXT.  TREES - TWILIGHT

The screaming is almost immediate.

Maximus and his cavalry watch as the fire pots crash down

into the German encampment.

EXT.  GERMAN CAMP - TWILIGHT

The fire pots shatter -- pitch splashes everywhere --

seconds later the bolts and flaming arrows slice down and

ignite the pitch -- FLAME EXPLODES -- it is a hellish,

napalm-like vision -- the conflagration illuminating the

twilight.

The deadly rain of flaming arrows spreads terror through

the German camp --

EXT.  TREES - TWILIGHT

Maximus watches the German camp.

He can see the nightmare destruction of the encampment

continuing -- fire pots and Scorpion bolts and flaming

arrows -- panic in the German encampment.

He sees the Germans begin fleeing across the plain.  He

quickly raises his sword and whispers a prayer, then turns

to his men:

He spurs his horse and races out of the trees to the

plain...

EXT.  PLAIN - BATTLEGROUND - TWILIGHT

Maximus leads the terrifying and relentless cavalry charge

-- Titus at his side -- the Felix Regiment screams out

fearsome war cries as they gallop across the muddy plain

toward the Germans --

Fire pots and flaming arrows are crashing down everywhere

around them --

The cavalry SLAMS into the Germans at full gallop --

It is carnage.

The Felix Regiment warriors slash ruthlessly with short

swords -- slicing a path of sheer destruction through the

Germans -- but the Germans fight with equal brutality --

and the Germans also fight with the desperation of a

hopeless last chance -- they pull and spear Roman soldiers

off horses whenever they can --

Maximus spins his horse and swings his sword with expert

efficiency -- a spear stabs through the neck of his horse

and it immediately collapses forward --

Maximus sails over the horse's head and crashes to the

muddy ground -- he jumps up and is in the midst of the

battle --

The flaming arrows and exploding fire pots create a

ferocious inferno everywhere around the battle -- the

flames silhouetting the fighting --

On the ground, Maximus proves his absolute worth as a

warrior -- he hacks and dodges -- ghastly images of true

ancient warfare -- Maximus' eyes burn with a zealous fire

as he fights for his life --

He finds he is momentarily at a terrible disadvantage --

Germans are surrounding him from all sides -- as he fights

he looks for an advantage -- for his soldiers -- for

anything -- he is doomed --

Then -- an almost mystical image -- Maximus' wolf leaps

through a wall of flame --

"The Wolf of Rome" savages several Germans around Maximus

-- giving him the help he needed.

The wolf and his master fight, side-by-side.

EXT.  HILLTOP - TWILIGHT

We see an old man's face, staring down at the battle.  The

face is weather-beaten, ailing.  The roaring flames from

the battlefield below flicker in his sad eyes.

MARCUS AURELIUS, the Emperor of Rome, is on a horse.  A

metal brace extends from the back of his saddle.  He is

strapped to the brace with thick, leather straps.

He watches as the Felix Regiment below concludes the

battle.  The cheering of the Regiment can be heard as the

final, isolated pockets of Germans are cut down.

Behind Marcus the sun is setting, painting the world blood

red.

EXT.  BATTLEFIELD - SUNSET

Maximus, bloody and spent, walks through the aftermath of

the carnage.  The Wolf of Rome is at his side.  Dead and

dying by the hundreds are scattered everywhere.  Roman

surgeons are attending to the wounded.

Marcus walks to him, embraces him warmly.

Marcus takes Maximus' arm and they walk through the masses

of bodies.  Maximus holds Marcus' arm firmly, quietly

supporting him as they walk.

Suddenly, a tethered GERMAN PRISONER they are passing

calls out to them:

Maximus and Marcus stop.  A soldier moves quickly to

silence the German Prisoner.

The soldier moves to kill the insolent Prisoner.

The soldier leads the German Prisoner away.

Maximus and Marcus continue walking in silence for a beat.

Then:

They continue walking through the mountains of bodies...

EXT.  ROAD - SUNSET

Maximus and Marcus are now walking along a road through

the dense forest.  Slaves follow behind them, leading

their horses.

Both sides of the road are filled with the men of the

Felix Regiment.  As Maximus and Marcus pass, the battered

and bloody soldiers drag themselves to their feet, raising

their swords, paying silent homage.

Just then Commodus canters into view with his Praetorian

Guard escort.  He watches the army honor Maximus with rank

envy as he nears.

He rides up to Maximus and Marcus.

He leaps from his horse.

Commodus embraces him, awkward.

Commodus embraces Maximus, even more awkward.

They walk, Maximus still supporting Marcus, as:

Maximus laughs.

Maximus waves for Marcus' horse.  It is brought up.

Several soldiers carefully help the old man into the

saddle.  He is then tethered to the brace on his saddle.

It is a slow, graceful and embarrassing ordeal for the

Emperor of Rome.

When at last he is strapped in, he looks to Maximus.

Without a word to his son, Marcus nods and the horse is

slowly lead away.

Commodus and Maximus watch him go.

A beat.

He turns and stalks away.

EXT.  TENT CITY - NIGHT

We see the Roman encampment, a sea of tents.  Hundreds of

campfires burn before the tents.

INT.  HOSPITAL TENT - NIGHT

Maximus enters a large tent and is met by a spectacle of

the dead and dying.  Roman surgeons are working feverishly

to save lives.  Limbs are amputated, the bloody stumps

quickly cauterized with hot irons.  Leeches and bronze

cups are employed for blood-letting to balance "humours."

Anesthesia as we know it is nonexistent.  Wine amphoras

are passed around and orderlies fan narcotic smoke toward

the patients.  Mostly, though, they just hold down the

writhing patients.

Maximus moves through the tent, offering a word of comfort

here and there.  All the wounded are delighted to see him.

He goes to an older soldier, GALLUS, who has one wooden

hand.  His other hand is bandaged.

Maximus smiles and moves on.

He stops at a young soldier, VALERIUS, whose head has been

shaved.  A hole has been bored into his skull to relieve

the pressure on his brain.  The young soldier is dying.

A beat.  Maximus sits by his cot.  He takes Valerius'

hand.

A beat.

He smiles.  And he is dead.

Maximus sits for a moment.  He gently closes Valerius'

eyes.  And Maximus finds that he is weeping.

He is not ashamed of the tears.

INT.  MESS TENT - NIGHT

An immediate swirl of noise.  The grand mess tent is

crowded with soldiers.  They are still filthy with caked-

on mud and blood.  Wounds are bandaged and tankards are

raised in celebration of the victory.

Marcus sits in a central position and receives visitors.

Currently two Senators, FALCO and GAIUS, are bowing before

him.

Meanwhile, Maximus stands with his lieutenants, Titus and

Quintus.  A wound on Maximus' arm has been bound.

Commodus perambulates up to them.

An awkward glance between the soldiers.  This sort of talk

is offensively premature.

Senators Gaius and Falco join them.

Laughter.

Meanwhile, a dark eye is studying the men through a hidden

slit in the tent wall.  The eye is particularly drawn to

Maximus.

A beat.  Commodus' eyes flash fire at this public rebuke.

He very quickly gets control.

He notes his father being helped out of the tent by

several body slaves.

INT.  TENT CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Marcus is helped out of the mess tent into a tent corridor

attached.

He sees his daughter Lucilla in the corridor, spying in

through the slit in the tent wall.  He watches her,

smiles.

She turns to him.  He leaves his body slaves and goes to

her.

A beat.  They stare at each other.  He finally smiles.

She smiles and takes his arm.  They slowly walk down the

tent corridor as:

They disappear into darkness.

EXT.  TENT CITY - DAWN

Maximus is slogging through the mud and snow that blankets

the Rome camp.  He stops to observe an unusual sight.

Commodus is stripped almost naked, his chiseled body

covered in a fine sheen of sweat.  He and his six

CENTURION BODY GUARDS are going through their daily

ritual.  They defy the sub-zero temperatures and hack at

small trees with swords.

It is an eerie, zen-like workout.  Commodus' intense

concentration is unnerving.

Maximus watches for a moment then moves on.  He approaches

a large network of tents.  He enters.

INT.  MARCUS' TENT - DAY

Maximus enters Marcus' darkened tent.  Flickering braziers

provide the only light in the enormous Imperial tent.

Heavy beams support the canopy and they creak like the

timbers of a ship as the tent sways slightly in the wind.

Marcus stands before a map of the Roman Empire.

Marcus holds out a scroll.

A stunned pause.  Maximus stares at him.

A long beat.

A beat.

Marcus sits.  He doesn't look at Maximus.

A pause.

A beat.

He holds out a hand to Maximus.  Maximus takes his hand,

deeply moved, kneeling.

A beat.

A beat.

Maximus looks at him.

A beat.

Maximus nods and rises.  He begins to go.  Stops.

He goes.

INT.  TENT CORRIDOR - DAY

Maximus emerges from Marcus' tent into a long tent

corridor, deep in thought.

He turns.  Lucilla is waiting.  She glides to him.

He turns to her.

He turns and walks.  She walks with him.

A beat.

A beat.

A beat.

She smiles sadly.

A moment between them.  We sense there is much to be said,

much that could be said.

Finally:

He goes.  She watches him walk away.

INT.  MAXIMUS' TENT - NIGHT

Maximus kneels before a small altar in his tent.  He faces

six small figures that represent his dead ancestors.

He looks at his "ancestors" for a moment and then blows

out the candles around them.

INT.  MARCUS' TENT - NIGHT

Commodus' eyes are red with weeping.  He sits, head down,

at the foot of Marcus' bed and speaks to his father.

He stands.  We see that he is holding the scroll denoting

Marcus' intention to nominate Maximus as Emperor to the

Senate.  Commodus cannot control his tears.

Commodus weeps.

INT.  MAXIMUS' TENT - NIGHT

Quintus is waking Maximus --

Maximus leaps up and throws on a cloak, strides out with

Quintus...

EXT.  TENT CITY - NIGHT

Dead of night.  Maximus and Quintus stride quickly through

the sleeping camp toward Marcus' tent.

They continue on toward Marcus' tent.

INT.  MARCUS' TENT - NIGHT

Maximus and Quintus stride into the tent -- Maximus slams

to a halt.  Stunned.

Commodus stands before him.  Lucilla stands in a corner of

the tent, head down.

And Marcus Aurelius dead, lying on his bed.

Maximus stares at Marcus.

Maximus, not even hearing, steps past him to Marcus.

He stands for a moment and then slowly kneels before

Marcus and gently kisses the old man's forehead.  A ritual

farewell.

A moment of silent mourning and then Maximus stands.  He

turns very, very slowly to Commodus.

Maximus glares at him:

Commodus does not respond.

Maximus glances to Lucilla, she avoids his eyes.

A beat.

Maximus turns back to Marcus.

Without a glance to Commodus, he stalks out.

A silent beat.  Then Commodus nods to Quintus.  Quintus

goes.

Lucilla looks at Commodus for a long moment, her face an

enigmatic tornado of complex emotions.

Then:

INT.  MAXIMUS' TENT - NIGHT

Maximus is kneeling before his ancestors, head down, his

fists clenched, praying.

Quintus and four Praetorian ASSASSINS suddenly burst in --

the assassins move immediately to bind Maximus -- swords

at his throat --

Quintus goes to Maximus' armor, which hangs nearby, and

slowly removes his seal of office.

They pull Maximus out --

EXT.  MAXIMUS' TENT - TENT CITY - NIGHT

Five horses are waiting.

They are almost run over by a stern cohort of twenty

Praetorians who gallop past.  Maximus knows immediately

what this means.

A beat.

Maximus lunges at him -- the Praetorians subdue him --

slamming him with a sword hilt -- knocking him

unconscious.

EXT.  FOREST ROAD - DAWN

The four Praetorian assassins lead Maximus along a road.

He sits slumped in his saddle, drained.

The three other assassins climb from their horses.

Assassin #2 pushes Maximus from his horse.  He falls to

the ground hard.

Assassin #3 and Assassin #4 drag Maximus down a densely

forested hill along the road.  Maximus' hands are still

bound in front of him.  He seems totally lacking in any

resistance.

EXT.  FOREST - BELOW THE ROAD - DAWN

Maximus eyes the two assassins as they troop down the

hill away from the road, he notes their sparkling armor.

The armor of men who have never seen real battle.

They stop.  They are far down the hill, out of sight of

the road.

Maximus kneels, his whole body secretly coiling.  Assassin

#3 stands over him as:

Maximus points his bound hands at a spot on the back of

his neck.

Assassin #3 dutifully puts the point of his sword on the

spot on Maximus' neck.

A grave mistake.

Maximus instantly grabs the blade of the sword with his

hands and yanks it from Assassin #3 -- EXPLODING up -- his

hands are bleeding but he tosses the sword into the air

and catches it -- swings the sword with brutal efficiency

-- decapitating both assassins --

EXT.  FOREST ROAD - DAWN

On the road above, the other two Assassins are on their

horses, waiting.

They hear a quick yelp from below.  And then nothing.

Assassin #1 nods for Assassin #2 to check on the

execution.  Assassin #2 canters off the road and down the

hill...

EXT.  FOREST - BELOW THE ROAD - DAWN

Assassin #2 canters down the hillside.

He senses movement behind him -- spins around, drawing his

sword -- too late --

Maximus throws a sword -- it flashes through the air --

and into Assassin #2.

EXT.  FOREST ROAD - DAWN

Assassin #1 waits on his horse.  He hears the commotion

below -- spins his horse around just as Maximus bursts to

the road.  He stands with a sword.

Assassin #1 spurs his horse and gallops toward Maximus at

full speed -- Maximus crouches and prepares --

Assassin #1 and Maximus swirl together for an instant --

both slashing brutally --

Assassin #1 continues to gallop past Maximus.  He stops.

He looks down.  A wound in his stomach.  He falls off his

horse.  Dead.

Maximus has also been wounded -- a deep gash on his side.

He fights the pain as he moves toward the horses...

EXT.  FOREST ROAD - DAY

Maximus is galloping through the forest at lightning

speed, leading four horses behind him.  The gash in his

side bleeding.

EXT.  TENT CITY - DAY

A gloomy day.  Emperor Commodus stands before the

assembled Felix Regiment.

The soldiers are already uneasy.  They note Quintus

standing by Commodus, wearing Maximus' seal of office.

Where is Maximus?

Titus glances quickly to Gallus, whose hand is bandaged

from surgery.  They know this cannot be true.

The Felix Regiment responds, many unsure.

Commodus strides off and the Felix Regiment slowly

disbands, muttering to one another in confusion.

Titus and Gallus go to Quintus.

He stalks off.  Titus and Gallus, concerned, watch him

follow after Commodus.

INT.  MAXIMUS' TENT - DAY

Lucilla stands in Maximus' tent.  She looks around.  She

gently touches his Lorica Segmentata.  Her fingertips move

along the contours of his armor.  She tries to retain her

neutral demeanor.

She notes his "ancestors" on the small alter.

EXT.  HILLSIDE - NIGHT

Maximus continues to gallop, he is on a different horse.

He leads only two horses now.

EXT.  VINEYARD - DAY

Maximus' home in Spain is beautiful beyond measure.

We see verdant farmlands and vineyards and a spacious

house nestled amid gently rolling hills.

Maximus' eight-year-old SON is in a paddock playing with

his pony.  He stops, sees something.  Over a hill, he can

just glimpse a battle flag, approaching.

He screams with joy and runs toward the flag as he calls:

Maximus' WIFE emerges from the house, drying her hands on

a cloth and smiles.

Maximus' Son races toward the flag.  He can just see the

soldiers beginning to appear over the hill.  Not a Roman

Legion at all.  Twenty Praetorians canter over the hill.

Maximus' Son stops, confused.

EXT.  OLIVE GROVE - DAY

Maximus is galloping up a hill, leading only one horse

now.  The horse he is on is exhausted, spent, foam coats

its neck.  It can't make it.

The horse collapses and Maximus falls.  He immediately

leaps onto the remaining horse and continues riding up the

hill.

EXT.  HILLS AROUND VINEYARD - SUNSET

Maximus is racing over the countryside, galloping in a

frenzy.  His wound is bleeding profusely, coating the side

of his horse.

He rears the horse to a stop for a moment.  Over a hill he

can see thick black smoke rising.  He spurs the horse and

gallops over the hill...

EXT.  VINEYARD - SUNSET

And his worst nightmares are realized.

His home and his vineyards have been destroyed.  The earth

has been scorched and his house is still smoldering.  He

rides up to the house and practically falls off the horse.

He pulls himself up and walks past the smoldering debris

of his house, fearing what he knows he will find.

He sees the bodies of servants scattered about in the

ruins.  He sees a Praetorian battle flag.

He continues on, his wound bleeding more with every

tortured step.  He finally stops.  He stares up.

His wife and his son have been crucified and burnt.  They

are nothing more than grotesquely twisted, charred shapes.

Maximus instantly collapses to his knees -- he howls out

his torment in a heartrending keen of despair as he coats

his face in the ashes of his dead world.  He sinks into

unconsciousness, praying for death.

EXT.  VINEYARD - DAY

An unusual jingling sound is heard.  Maximus appears to be

dead, his gaping wound beginning to fester.

The source of the jingling becomes clear when we see the

feet of Bedouin brigands, with delicate anklets, shuffling

around him.  A hand touches his sandals.  Rich sandals.

Another touches his tunic.  Good cloth.

Suddenly Maximus groans.  The hands stop.  He's alive.  A

bit of quick language in an unknown tongue.

Then the hands grab Maximus and drag him away.

EXT.  SLAVE WAGON TRAIN - DAY

Maximus' eyes slowly open --

Inches away from his face -- a lion roars --

Maximus lurches back.

He looks around to realize he is in a filthy slave wagon.

Three other wagons slowly move over the desert landscape.

Exotic animals are caged in pens or led alongside the

wagons:  lions, panthers, zebras, a giraffe.  A dozen

slaves are chained together alongside sacks of spices and

other cargo.  Bedouin slave traders jabber in a surreal

babel of foreign tongues.

And someone is looking at him.  JUBA, a striking African,

is gazing at him impassively as he chews something.  Juba

is also chained.

Juba spits what he has been chewing into his hands and

moves to Maximus.

Maximus stares at him.

Maximus looks down -- the bloody wound at his side.

Juba carefully places his poultice over the wound --

Maximus hisses in pain -- Juba massages the poultice into

the wound gently as:

Maximus stares at him.  Juba looks down at him with the

barest hint of a smile.

EXT.  SLAVE MARKET - DAY

The heat of Morocco is unlike anything Maximus has ever

known.  Shimmering heat waves undulate over the sand.

The provincial market is bustling like the proverbial

anthill.  Slave traders and dealers and merchants move

around, all talking very quickly and very emphatically.

Maximus, Juba and a number of other slaves are on display,

poked and prodded and fondled.  Their BEDOUIN SLAVE TRADER

sings out their praises to any passers.

The crowd parts almost magically for the dramatic arrival

of PROXIMO.  Proximo is a large man of immense appetites.

He has the ferocious appearance of a true pirate.  Two

slaves follow behind him and impotently swat at flies with

switches.

Proximo SLAMS a fist into the Slave Trader's face.  The

Slave Trader sails back.

The Slave Trader pulls himself up, hugely obsequious.

Proximo examines the animals.

Proximo moves to Maximus.  The Slave Trader forces open

Maximus' mouth.

Proximo notes the many old battle scars on Maximus' body.

Maximus doesn't respond.

Maximus doesn't respond.

Proximo looks at Maximus, notes the many battle scars

again.  The scars, and something he senses in Maximus'

eyes, is enough for Proximo to consider it.

The Slave Trader and his colleagues grab Maximus and

bustle him across the market, unlocking his chains.

Maximus has no idea what's going on.

In the center of the market place, a veritable GIANT of a

man sits on a small stool, a wooden sword in his hand.  He

is hunched over and chained to the ground by a ten foot

chain shackled to his ankle.  A think metal helmet is

riveted around his entire head, only long turfs of hair

emerging.  His dim eyes stare listlessly through a slot in

the helmet.

The Slave Trader puts a wooden sword in Maximus' hand and

shoves him toward the Giant.  The Giant stands.  He towers

over Maximus.

The Giant suddenly swings his sword -- he moves with

remarkable quickness -- Maximus makes no attempt to block

the blow -- it sends him flying to the ground.

Maximus pulls himself up.

The Giant moves in and hits him again -- Maximus recoils

-- the Giant hits him again -- Maximus falls.

Maximus pulls himself up.

The Giant moves in again -- he slams him a few more times

-- Maximus makes no attempt to protect himself -- he

falls.

Maximus pulls himself up.

The Giant is about to attack again --

His colleagues race into the ring and haul the Giant away

from Maximus.  The Giant quietly sits back on his stool.

Proximo studies Maximus for a moment and then glances to

the Slave Trader.

EXT.  PROXIMO'S SCHOOL - DAY

Maximus and Juba are crammed into a wagon with about ten

other slaves, including a very scared and reedy SCRIBE.

Other wagons are filled with exotic animals, including

several lions.

The wagons move through a crowded casbah and are taken

through an imposing set of gates to...

EXT.  PROXIMO'S SCHOOL - COMPOUND - DAY

An open compound in Proximo's school.  On one side of the

compound is a series of cages filled with wild animals of

every description -- including Proximo's two hapless

giraffes.

Proximo's house slaves begin unloading the newly purchased

exotic animals into cages as Maximus and the new slaves

are unloaded.  Heavily armed guards supervise everything.

But Proximo's slaves are having a bit of a problem with

one of the new lions -- it growls and resists them.

Without the slightest hesitation, Proximo thunders to the

lion and grabs it by the mane -- manhandling it into a

cage.

He kicks the lion in the rear as he shoves it into the

cage.

Proximo's provincial school resembles nothing so much as a

seedy prison.  The fading grandeur of the decaying

battlements and the sweeping North African architecture

only slightly mitigate the brutal feel of the place.

And if Maximus had any doubts as to Proximo's profession

-- all doubts are washed away when he sees the compound.

Twenty GLADIATORS are working out in the compound --

hacking at practice dummies and sparring.  The many

heavily armed guards oversee everything.  The gladiators

stop working out as they see the new slaves enter.  They

eye their potential new opponents warily.

One huge, glowering gladiator -- VIBIUS -- watches with

particular interest.  His eye is quickly drawn to the most

obvious athlete:  Juba.

The new slaves are herded to the middle of the compound

and house slaves immediately begin throwing buckets of

water on them, cleaning them.

Meanwhile, Proximo shrugs off his cloak.  A slave brings

him wine as he give his "welcoming speech" to the new

slaves:

Slaves now toss thick handfuls of powdered lime on the new

slaves -- they cough and clench their eyes shut, the lime

coats and stings their wet bodies.

Slaves throw more water on the new slaves -- washing off

the lime.

He gazes evenly at his new acquisitions.

He strides off and the guards shove the new gladiators

toward their cells.

INT.  PROXIMO'S SCHOOL - MAXIMUS' CELL - NIGHT

Maximus and Juba share a small, filthy cell.  The cell

door faces the open compound.  Across the compound they

can see the much more comfortable cells of the "star"

gladiators such as Vibius.

They both sit on the floor, leaning against the wall.

Juba is eating a bowl of food with a wooden spoon.

Maximus' bowl and spoon are at his side, he has not

touched them.

Maximus does not respond.

Maximus does not respond.

Maximus does not respond.

A long beat.

Maximus does not respond.

A beat.

Maximus finally looks at him.

Maximus does not respond.

EXT.  PROXIMO'S SCHOOL - COMPOUND - NIGHT

Maximus and Juba are being observed.  Proximo stands in

the shadows of the compound and watches intently.

EXT.  SLAVE WAGON - PROVINCIAL STREETS - DAY

Blood appears to be flowing across an oxen's back.  But

the blood is too rich, too red.

The oxen are pulling an open slave wagon through the

crowded streets of the town.  Hanging above the street is

dyed wool drying in the sun.  Vermilion and crimson dyes

drip down and splash across the oxen -- and splash across

the gladiators.

Maximus, Juba, the formidable Vibius are chained in the

back of the wagon.  Also the frightened Scribe.

Proximo and a few of his guards drive the wagon.  Proximo

has an umbrella over him, colored with years of dripping

dyes.

They pass a banner honoring Vibius, the star of Proximo's

stable.

Meanwhile, the terrified Scribe is almost weeping,

chattering nervously to Vibius, chained next to him:

He suddenly vomits.

The Scribe begins to weep.

The crowds in the street jeer at the passing gladiators.

Occasionally throwing trash at them.  A pack of children

run alongside the wagon, chanting:

Maximus watches the children for a moment and then another

sight draws his attention.  Over some buildings he can see

vultures circling in the distance.

EXT.  PROVINCIAL ARENA - DUGOUT - DAY

In the cramped holding area of the arena, a dugout beneath

the stands, Maximus and the other gladiators are waiting.

Proximo walks before them, giving a final "pep talk."  He

gazes at them evenly, his eyes going from face to face.

He stops at Maximus.

Drums are heard from the arena.  Proximo nods to a waiting

blacksmith.

The blacksmith begins slamming shackles on the gladiator's

wrists -- chaining them together in teams of two by a

chain about four feet long.

The blacksmith is about to chain Maximus to the Scribe.

Proximo nods to Vibius, who, for reasons we shall soon

see, makes no protest to being chained to the whimpering

Scribe.

Proximo watches the blacksmith shackle Maximus and Juba

together and then strides off.

EXT.  PROVINCIAL ARENA - DAY

Proximo sits in a box with several other GLADIATOR

TRAINERS.  They drink wine and eat constantly.  A

perpetual chatter of wagers and odds and side bets.

The arena is only sparsely attended this day.

In the arena:

Proximo's chained teams enter the arena, five teams.

Maximus and Juba are chained together.  Some of the small

crowd cheers for Vibius.  He acknowledges the cheers.  He

is chained to the weeping Scribe.

In the box:

Trainer #1 laughs.

In the arena:

From the opposite end of the arena a dozen armored, very

scary Andabatae thunder into the arena.  Some of the crowd

cheers.

The Andabatae immediately race for the chained teams and

the battle is on.

Vibius spins into action -- dragging the weeping Scribe

after him as he circles opponents and fights -- the Scribe

is almost instantly killed -- Vibius immediately hacks

through the Scribe's wrist and frees himself, as Proximo

surely intended.  Vibius is now free to fight alone,

swinging the chain as an additional weapon.

Juba's eyes dart everywhere as he tries to move with

Maximus -- Maximus neither helps nor hinders -- allowing

Juba to pull him along --

Proximo, now that his star Vibius is safe, watched Maximus

and Juba closely.

Juba fights well, with a strange elegance, his body

flowing like liquid -- but he is inexperienced.  He

strikes a few blows and then tries to move away -- finally

he is in trouble -- cornered -- a huge Andabata is slicing

at him -- it is a desperate battle -- Juba is losing --

his sword is slammed away -- the Andabata raises his sword

for the kill --

And Maximus strikes.

With a sudden roar he EXPLODES into action -- he swings

past Juba and blocks the blow meant for Juba -- then he

slashes the Andabata -- killing him -- he pulls Juba after

him as he fights --

It is a dazzling display of Maximus' skill -- he moves

through the Andabatae at amazing speed -- spinning around

Juba and protecting him -- slashing ruthlessly -- pulling

Juba after him and commanding the battle -- Juba recovers

a sword and they fight together.

In the box:

Proximo watches, smiles.  A gladiator is born.

EXT.  ROME - WAGON - DAY

SENATOR GRACCHUS, an imposing, moral and corpulent man in

his 60's, is riding in a luxurious wagon with Senator

Gaius.

And CAPTAIN MARCELLUS, the handsome Head of the Roman City

Guard.

Their wagon slowly maneuvers through the crowded streets

of Rome.  The cosmopolitan bustle of the great urban

center is everywhere around them.

Their wagon stops -- hopelessly stuck in a massive traffic

jam of chariots, wagons and sedan chairs.

INT.  PALACE - THRONE ROOM - DAY

Emperor Commodus is standing before a group of male

children and their tutors in his throne room.

The throne room is still very much the province of his

father.  Manuscripts and astronomical charts and papyrus

scrolls and wax tablets litter the heavy desk.  A large

bust of Marcus Aurelius is in one corner.

Lucilla and Senator Falco are present.  So too Senators

Gracchus and Gaius and Captain Marcellus.

A well-rehearsed child presents Commodus with a laurel

wreath.

The child smiles and moves back to his fellows.

Commodus actually bows before them, an unimaginable honor.

The tutors bow in response and herd the children out.

Commodus moves to the desk, standing over it and gazing at

Marcus' scrolls as:

Commodus slowly begins pushing Marcus' papyrus scrolls off

the desk to the floor, one by one, as:

As Commodus speaks he moves to the chair behind the desk,

tries it, doesn't like it, nods to a slave.  The chair is

whisked away.

As Commodus speaks he moves to the bust of Marcus, studies

it, doesn't like it, nods to a slave and the bust is

whisked away.  Lucilla watches this closely.

Commodus stops.  Looks at him.  A lethal moment.

Startled looks between Gracchus, Gaius and Marcellus.

A beat.

Gracchus ignores a warning look from Gaius.

Commodus spins on him so quickly and with such feral

violence that everyone is shocked --

He snarls like a great jungle cat and he stalks away.

Senator Falco quickly follows.

A dreadful silence.

Then:

She sweeps out.

A beat.

A beat.

INT.  PROVINCIAL ARENA - DUGOUT - TUNNELS - DAY

Maximus is marching relentlessly through the dugout and

cramped, serpentine trench-like tunnels that lead to the

arena.

We don't really see Maximus well in the dark tunnels.

Proximo scurries to keep up with him -- they brush past

gladiators who line the walls.  Some are wounded, some are

being attended to by surgeons, some are shell-shocked,

some are nervously waiting to go on, whispering prayers.

We twist and turn in the tunnels with Proximo and Maximus

as:

The roar of the crowd is growing, they are nearing the

arena...

Without a word to Proximo, or a moment's hesitation,

Maximus strides into the arena.

EXT.  PROVINCIAL ARENA - DAY

We continue with Maximus as he strides into the roaring

arena.

We finally see him in the blazing sunlight -- he wears

traditional gladiator armor and now has longer hair and a

beard --

A battle is already in progress, fighting and dead and

dying gladiators crowd the arena --

We stay with Maximus as he wades through his opponents,

fighting them heroically, slashing through them without

stopping --

The large crowd cheers mightily -- chants of "Spaniard!

Spaniard!  Spaniard!"

We stay with Maximus as he cuts through the four Celts

like a scythe through wheat and then we dramatically pull

up and away --

Taking in the roaring arena and the hero.

EXT.  PROXIMO'S SCHOOL - COMPOUND - NIGHT

A large mess area has been set up.  The tables around the

compound are crowded with gladiators.  Guards everywhere.

Maximus and Juba enter.  Move to get food.  All

conversation gradually drains away as the other gladiators

watch them.  Silence.

Maximus and Juba note the strange silence as they move to

a large table.

Vibius is at the table with a number of other gladiators.

There are no places for Maximus and Juba.

Vibius stands and kicks two other gladiators off their

bench.

Maximus and Juba sit.

Vibius remains standing.  He begins to pound on the table

with his fist.  Soon all the gladiators are pounding on

their tables.  It is a cacophonous din honoring Maximus.

INT.  PROXIMO'S SCHOOL - PROXIMO'S CHAMBER - NIGHT

Proximo sits on a terrace overlooking his compound,

sipping wine.  Various gladiators can be seen working out

below.

A guard brings Maximus.  Proximo nods for the guard to

leave.

The plate is filled with honeyed butterflies, their wings

still moving slightly.

Maximus shakes his head.  Proximo pops one into his mouth.

He chews as he looks at Maximus.

Maximus shakes his head.

Maximus shakes his head.

A beat.

Maximus shakes his head.

Maximus shakes his head.

A beat.  Proximo studies him.

A beat.

A beat.

Proximo watches Maximus very closely for the following:

Maximus' eyes suddenly flash to Proximo.  He is

transfixed, his eyes burning.

A beat.

Maximus shakes his head.

A beat.  Proximo sees that Maximus' mind is racing.

A beat.

INT./ EXT.  SLAVE WAGON - OUTSIDE ROME - EVENING

Maximus is crouched in the back of an enclosed slave wagon

with Vibius, Juba and a few other gladiators.

In the distance, Rome.

INT.  PALACE - COMMODUS' BEDROOM - NIGHT

Commodus sits on his bed, rubbing his aching head.

Lucilla is preparing a drink for him, a medicinal tonic.

Unseen by him, she adds a little special powder to the

drink from a vial secreted in her robe.

She goes to him.

She takes a sip and then hands it to him.

She sits on the edge of the bed.  He drinks as:

A beat.  He is sleepy, he lies back on his bed.

A beat.

A beat.

He is asleep.

She watches him for a moment and then rises.

She goes.

INT.  PALACE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Lucilla moves down a long corridor in the palace and blows

out candles as she goes.

She finally arrives at her own chamber and enters...

INT.  PALACE - LUCILLA'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT

Senators Gracchus and Gaius and Captain Marcellus are

waiting.

A beat.  She looks at them.

A long beat.

A beat as her words sink in.

A door opens, a voice...

An eight-year-old boy stands in a doorway, sleepy.  He is

LUCIUS, Lucilla's son.

Lucius suddenly notices Senator Gracchus:

He leaps onto Gracchus -- Gracchus laughs and pulls

something from his robe.

Gracchus gives Lucius a beautifully painted toy of a sea

serpent.

Lucius runs to a map and stabs his finger at Achaea.  We

sense this is an old game between them.

Lucius goes.  Lucilla shuts the door after him.  A moment.

She turns to the others, a deep anguish in her eyes.

Gracchus goes to her, holds her.

INT./ EXT.  ROMAN STREETS - SLAVE WAGON - NIGHT

Maximus cranes for a sight of the Eternal City through a

hole in the wooden slats that cover the slave cart.

He can see only glimpses of Rome as they pass.  But the

images are not what he expected.  Alongside the undeniable

glory of the city, the madness and disease Marcus Aurelius

spoke of are readily apparent.

Maximus sees flashes of plague victims being tossed on

carts heaped with bodies -- he sees getting and spending

and commerce everywhere -- he sees fascist Praetorian

Guard units trooping past -- he sees the magnificent

architecture of the city -- he sees starving children

begging from filthy gutters -- he sees rich citizens out

for a stroll -- he sees a swirling combination of

sophistication and depravity, of civilization and

corruption.

He sits back in the cart, deep in thought.  Vibius looks

at him.

EXT.  PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - NIGHT

The slave wagon pulls up to Proximo's rather grand Roman

compound.  Guards unlock imposing gates and the wagon

drives in...

EXT.  PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - COURTYARD - NIGHT

Inside the gates is a large courtyard, much like Proximo's

Moroccan school but much more impressive.  A fountain with

an enormous statue of the war god Mars is central in the

courtyard.

The gladiators climb from the wagon, stretching after the

long journey.  Vibius leads Maximus and Juba to the

statue.  He wades through the fountain and kisses the toe

of Mars.

Juba steps up and kisses the toe.

Maximus kisses the toe as well.

Guards come and lead them to their cells, which line one

side of the courtyard.

INT.  PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - CELL - NIGHT

Later.  Maximus and Juba again share a cell.  It is more

comfortable than their cell in Morocco, befitting Maximus'

new status as one of the "stars."  A high, barred window

on one wall opens to the city.  Another barred window is

directly over them, twenty feet above.

Maximus pulls himself up to the side window, he looks out.

And sees at last... The Colosseum.

It is a breathtaking sight.  Monolithic Albert Speer-like

columns of light shine up from the Colosseum.  It seems to

illuminate the whole city and the heavens above.

Maximus drops back to the floor.

A beat.

A beat.

A beat.

A beat.

A beat.

A beat.

Juba looks at him.

A long beat.

Juba leans his head back and quietly begins to sing.  A

haunting lament in his native tongue.

EXT.  COLOSSEUM - DAY

A flurry of images from around the Colosseum, the energy

mounting.  At this point we see practically nothing of the

inside of the Colosseum:

Slaves are balancing high above the empty arena.  They are

on ropes unrolling huge rolls of muslin; sun tarps that

provide shade below...

Merchants open stalls in the curved arcade around outside

of the Colosseum.  They sell everything from food to magic

elixirs, from toys to aphrodisiacs.  They immediately

start declaiming and demonstrating the virtues of their

products...

Gangs of whores of both sexes trawl the streets.  They

have bizarrely-colored hair and elaborate makeup...

Citizens begin arriving, pushing past the vendors and the

pickpockets.  We see whole families with picnic lunches...

Ferocious animals are brought into the Colosseum in barred

cages...

In the busy arcade, barbers and blood-letters practice

their craft alongside exotic alchemists, fire eaters and

contortionists...

Richer citizens arrive in sedan chairs and chariots, they

feign indifference to the hooting mob...

Mounted City Guard police units try to retain some

order...

Gamblers crowd betting booths and haggle mercilessly...

Finally, we see Maximus and the other gladiators in a

slave cart.  Maximus watches everything as the slave cart

disappears into the Colosseum...

INT.  COLOSSEUM - ROUTE TO HOLDING CELLS - DAY

The interior of the Colosseum is a busy world unto itself.

Maximus and the others are lead by Proximo's guards down a

long ramp and past countless animal cages.  Gamblers

circulate everywhere and observe the warriors, angling for

the best odds and the best matches.

Maximus and the others are led even deeper into the bowels

of the Colosseum to a new whole subterranean realm.

Numerous cells line the walls.  Racks and racks of

weaponry and armor.

And, most striking, everywhere around them is the heavy

machinery of the spectacles above.  Huge "elevator"

platforms and ramps and pulleys and counterweights are

manned by teams of sweating slaves.

INT.  COLOSSEUM - HOLDING CELLS - DAY

Finally, Proximo's guards lead the gladiators to their

holding cells.  These cells are right at the edge of the

arena.  Barred windows offer a sand-level view of the

action.

Maximus immediately goes to a window and looks out.

He cannot see much of the entire arena, but what he does

see transfixes him.

A band of Christians are huddled together.  An eerie

silence from the Colosseum but for the prayers of the

Christians.

Maximus watches them.  One little girl peels past her

mother's arm.  She sees Maximus.  She smiles.

Suddenly a dozen ferocious lions race up a ramp by Maximus

-- they roar into the arena --

We do not see the carnage.  We watch Maximus' face as we

hear the sounds of the slaughter.

And the sound of the roaring crowd.

Maximus finally cannot watch.  He drops his head.

INT.  COLOSSEUM - TRAINER'S LAIR - DAY

Proximo is with a dozen other gladiator trainers and the

Colosseum's orator and majordomo, CASSIUS.  They are

haggling in an secluded area not far from the arena

itself.  Huge chalkboards chart the day's matches and

wagers and odds.

Colosseum touts continually erase and mark new figures on

the chalkboards to keep up with the swiftly changing

bouts.

The roar of the lions and the unnerving screams of the

Christians can clearly be heard.

Upset roars from some of the trainers.

The four trainers explode in a flurry of resistance --

He strides back to the arena.  The touts instantly begin

making new marks on the boards to represent the mysterious

"Carthage Spectacle" as some of the trainers hurry out.

Proximo walks with Trainer #4:

They disappear down a dark corridor, negotiating all the

while.

INT.  COLOSSEUM - HOLDING CELLS - DAY

Maximus, Juba, Vibius and another of Proximo's gladiators

are being armed.  They all wear mask-like helmets.

Proximo hurries to them.

Trumpets begin sounding from the arena.

The guards quickly bustle the four toward a gate leading

to a dark tunnel to the arena.

Short swords are shoved into their hands and the gate

rises.  They are pushed into the dark tunnel leading to

the arena.  The gate closes behind them.

The four gladiators stand for a moment and then slowly

walk down the tunnel to...

EXT.  COLOSSEUM - ARENA - DAY

At last we see it.

The mighty Colosseum Arena.

Nothing we could have possibly imagined could have

prepared us for the sight of the thousands and thousands

of screaming spectators, the row after row of cheering

faces.

It is staggering.

But for Maximus none of this exists.  His full attention

is focused on one spot alone.  The Imperial Box.

He can see Commodus and Lucilla sitting in the box.  The

box is elevated fifteen feet above the arena floor at the

top of a sheer black marble wall.  A cohort of fifty

imposing Praetorian Guard Archers surround the box.

Commodus' personal Body Guard of six Centurions actually

stand in the box itself, eyes constantly watching like

modern Secret Service agents.

Commodus is untouchable.

Meanwhile, three teams move from different entrances to

the arena.

As Cassius orates to the crowd:

He gestures to the gladiators in the arena.  The crowd

laughs, jeering the "barbarians."

The drummers begin pounding out a more insistent, heroic

beat.

The crowd EXPLODES in cheers as the huge doors at one end

of the arena suddenly burst open and ten chariots thunder

in --

Each chariot has a driver and an archer, both dressed in

theatrical versions of the familiar Roman Lorica

Segmentata.

A chaos of dust -- and the battle is on --

The chariots zoom around the arena -- the archers keeping

up a deadly hail of arrows.

Maximus immediately dives onto a passing chariot and kills

the charioteer and archer -- he dramatically leaps from

the front of the chariot to a lead horse and cuts it free.

And Maximus takes control, we see the General of the Felix

Regiment gloriously alive again as he barks out orders and

leads his gladiators in battle.  They follow him

faithfully, his stern commands unquestioned.

His strategies are quick and smart, he makes the

gladiators work together.

This kind of slaughter could last for hours...

We see flashes of the endless battle... Maximus races on

his horse past another chariot, kills the driver, the

chariot smashes into a wall... the sun sinks lower, the

shadows on the sand lengthen... areas of the sand are

swamps of blood, Juba slips, pulls himself up fighting...

Maximus uses Vibius to create a diversion, two chariots

collide... the crowd roars... a gladiator is dragged

between a chariot and the side wall of the arena... the

drummers pound out their relentless tattoo...

Finally...

Maximus is on his horse across from the final chariot.

We can see that Juba and Vibius and a few other gladiators

are still alive.  The rest of the arena is polluted with

the dead and injured.

Maximus spurs his horse and gallops toward the final

chariot -- the charioteer whips his horses and zooms

toward Maximus --

The crowd is breathless -- watching the final battle --

Maximus and the chariot speed toward each other -- like

Medieval jousters --

And collide in a flashing explosion of steel --

Maximus sails from his horse -- as the charioteer sails

from his chariot --

Maximus lands hard but quickly pulls himself up, he races

to the final charioteer.  The charioteer is defeated but

not dead.

Maximus glances around, all his opponents are defeated.

He stands over the final charioteer.  Then he simply

tosses down his sword.

The crowd is stunned by this strange act of mercy.  But

then an enormous roar grows from the crowd -- wave after

wave of adulation for the hero of the day.

Maximus looks around, taking it all in.

Then he turns to the Imperial Box.

Maximus slowly walks to before the the Imperial Box.  The

Praetorian Archers immediately raise their bows, pointing

down at him.

Maximus glares up at Commodus through his helmet mask.

Commodus returns his gaze, curious.

The crowd is intrigued, growing quiet.  What is going on?

Then Maximus simply turns and begins walking away.

The Colosseum is suddenly silent.  The Emperor is speaking

to a gladiator.

Maximus keeps walking.

Maximus keeps walking, his fists clenched now.

Commodus suddenly grabs a spear from a nearby Praetorian

and hurls it with perfect aim -- the crowd gasps -- the

spear sails past Maximus -- actually nicking his shoulder

-- it slices into the sand ahead of Maximus.

Maximus stops.

Maximus can hold it no longer.  He spins to Commodus --

ripping off his helmet mask -- and THUNDERING:

Commodus eyes shoot wide -- Lucilla bolts up -- Gracchus

leans forward -- Proximo is stunned -- the crowd is

mystified --

The Praetorian Archers tense their bows -- ready to kill

the defiant slave --

But something extraordinary stops them.  Almost as one

being the crowd roars -- they leaps to their feet and

thrust their thumbs up!  They cheer and stomp their

approval of Maximus.

Commodus looks around at the people of Rome, amazed.

He finally plasters on a benevolent smile and thrusts his

thumb up!  The Praetorians lower their bows.

And the crowd cheers.  Never in the long, long history of

the Colosseum have they ever seen such a thing.

Maximus leads his gladiators out of the arena.

INT.  PALACE - THRONE ROOM - NIGHT

To our great surprise, Commodus is not raging.  He sits

quietly on the polished marble floor in front of a model

of the Colosseum.  He moves model pieces around in the

Colosseum, planning his festival.

Lucilla stands, tense.

Lucilla watches her brother cautiously, expecting the

explosion.  He carefully moves some model pieces in the

arena.

Lucilla is growing more and more unnerved at Commodus'

unusual serenity.

A beat.  Commodus laughs.  A beat.

A beat as he looks at her.

She does not answer.

He picks up a model tiger and puts it in the arena.  He

looks at the model tiger and smiles.

INT.  PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - CELL - NIGHT

Maximus silently awaits Commodus' assassins with Juba.

They hear footsteps outside the cell.  Maximus stands,

preparing for death.

The door swings open and they are surprised to see Proximo

sweeping in with a cloaked woman.  The woman gives Proximo

a bag of money.

He beckons to Juba, they go, shutting the door behind

them.  The woman pulls off her cloak, it is Lucilla.

Maximus glares at her, his muscles tensing.

Maximus backs up, fighting the urge to strangle her on the

spot.  He finally bumps into a wall of the cell.

A long, tense moment.

She does not look at him.

She finally looks up at Maximus.

A beat.  Despite himself, Maximus is moved.

A beat.

A beat.  Maximus is surprised at her direct answer.

A beat.

She rivets him intensely with her eyes.

A beat.

A long beat.  Maximus' cold eyes give away nothing.

Lucilla turns and starts to go.  She stops, not looking

back.

She then pulls something from her robes and sets it down,

a little bundle wrapped in cloth.  She sweeps out.  The

sound of the door being bolted shut on the other side.

Maximus stands for a moment and then goes to what she has

left.  He opens the cloth.  Inside are his six "ancestor"

figures.

He picks up one of the figures.  He looks at it deeply,

gently feeling along the contours with a finger.

EXT.  COLOSSEUM - ARENA - DAY

The Colosseum is again packed.  Commodus, Lucilla and her

son Lucius are in the Imperial Box.

It is late in the day and teams of slaves are cleaning the

arena after a bout.  They haul off carcasses and toss down

fresh sand.

Meanwhile, Cassius is orating to the crowd:

The crowd erupts in paroxysms of joy as TIGER explodes

into the arena in an ornate chariot.  Tiger is a fierce

man in his 40's, his brutal, scarred face and hugely

muscled body a testament to his many years in the arena.

Tiger speeds around the rim of the arena in his chariot,

raising an arm in triumph.  The crowd roars.

INT.  COLOSSEUM - HOLDING CELLS - DAY

Proximo stands with Maximus, who is busy strapping on

armor.

INT.  COLOSSEUM - ARENA - DAY

Tiger waits.  He stands in the center of the arena.  He

has only a traditional short sword.  The crowd is

breathless with anticipation.  As:

The crowd cheers.  Maximus appears from his gate.  His

fans have increased in number considerably.  They eagerly

crane forward and celebrate him.

Meanwhile, Maximus looks at Tiger.  Only one man with a

sword?  Maximus approaches, cautious but confident.

He stops a few feet from Tiger.  They lock eyes, salute

each other and then turn to the Imperial Box, raising

their swords.

The crowd waits eagerly for the immortal words...

The crowd cheers and Maximus immediately turns and starts

slashing -- Tiger easily blocks and strikes back --

The sword play is very fast -- they block and parry and

hack like lightning -- constantly attacking -- they are

perfectly matched --

As he fights Maximus becomes aware of a strange sound over

the roar of the crowd -- a low rumbling -- then he feels

something -- a vibration in the ground --

Suddenly traps doors swing open and four enormous

platforms rise into view.  On each platform is a snarling

Bengal tiger restrained by a chain.  Tiger's teams of

"cornermen" hold the chains through a pulley system.  The

cornermen are safely inside cages.  The platforms stop at

ground level.

The four ferocious tigers now mark the four corners of the

battleground.

Tiger takes advantage of Maximus' momentary confusion and

assaults brutally -- forcing him back toward one of the

tigers -- the tiger claws for Maximus -- Maximus just

evades it claws -- rolls for a new position -- another

tiger snaps at him --

Tiger attacks -- Maximus is on the defensive -- fighting

off Tiger and evading the four snarling beasts --

And then all four tigers are suddenly closer.  The teams

of cornermen are letting the chains play out, bit by bit,

gradually reducing the size of the battle ground.  The

crowd roars.

But the fight is hardly fair.

Whenever Tiger is near one of the tigers the cornermen

pull back the tiger slightly -- when Maximus is near a

tiger they let it out a bit.

Maximus and Tiger fight -- swirling action -- finally,

Maximus has the edge -- he circles so that the sun stabs

into Tiger's eyes -- then Maximus lunges forward under

Tiger's swinging sword and SLAMS into him -- they fall --

a tiger swats at Maximus' face -- he jerks his head back

-- he shoots out a leg and kicks Tiger's sword toward one

of the tigers -- it is out of reach -- Maximus leaps up

and stands over the winded Tiger, sword to his throat.

Tiger is gasping for breath, crushed.

Then one of Tiger's corners suddenly cheats -- they

completely release a tiger -- it leaps for Maximus --

Maximus barely has time to turn -- the tiger crashes into

him -- its claws slashing into his back, cutting through

his leather armor -- Maximus shoves an armored forearm

into the tiger's jaws and stabs with his sword --

Tiger takes this chance to pull himself up -- one of his

corners throws him another sword -- the crowd boos --

Maximus wrestles with the tiger -- spinning it around with

superhuman effort so it is always between himself and

Tiger -- so that Tiger can't get at him --

Maximus finally kills the tiger and leaps for Tiger -- he

quickly disarms him and tosses him to the ground --

Maximus stands over him -- ready to administer the coup de

grace.

All eyes turn to the Emperor.

Commodus slowly stands and steps to the edge of the

Imperial Box.  He raises his arm and gives the fatal

thumbs down.

Maximus looks up at him.

And then defiantly tosses the sword to the ground,

refusing to kill Tiger.

Commodus is stunned.

The crowd gasps -- a collective intake of breath -- and

then an enormous roar building.  It cascades around the

Colosseum.  It is a roaring celebration of the unexpected

act of mercy.  And the delicious act of defiance of the

Emperor.

Commodus slowly sits.

Maximus walks across the arena -- the people stand and

cheer for him.  Cries of "Maximus the Merciful" can be

heard.

It is the birth of a hero.

INT.  COLOSSEUM - HOLDING CELLS - DAY

Maximus is resting in his cell after the battle, head

down, deep in thought.

Maximus looks up, Lucius is standing at his cell.  Maximus

has no idea who the boy is -- just another young fan --

but Maximus is immediately struck by Lucius' resemblance

to his own son.

A beat.

These simple words strike something deep in Maximus.

Lucilla appears from the shadows and puts her hands on

Lucius' shoulders.

Lucius runs off to his Male ATTENDANT, who leads him away.

A long beat as Maximus and Lucilla look at each other.

Finally:

A drum beat is heard.  It increases throughout the

following scenes, building momentum like a Roman gallery

accelerating to ramming speed.

The conspiracy scenes are enclosed in a montage of scenes

in and around the arena showing Maximus' growing

popularity with the People of Rome...

EXT.  COLOSSEUM - ARENA - DAY

Maximus is fighting an opponent.

The drums continue...

INT.  THE SENATE - DAY

Lucilla conspires with Senators Gracchus and Gaius and

Captain Marcellus in a dark corner of the Senate.

Whispers.

A beat.

A beat.

A beat.

A beat.  She glances at him.

The drums continue...

EXT.  COLOSSEUM - ARENA - DAY

Maximus defeats his opponent.  He stands over him.  He

does not kill him.

He tosses his sword down and walks away.  The crowd goes

crazy, roaring their approval of Maximus.

Senator Falco, sits in the stands and watches with some

alarm.  He glances around as the crowd exalts Maximus.  He

is becoming a hero to the people.

The drums continue...

INT.  COLOSSEUM - HOLDING CELLS - DAY

Maximus returns to the holding cells.  Vibius and Juba are

waiting.

Maximus goes.  Vibius thinks about it, listening to the

adulation of the crowd.

The drums continue...

INT./ EXT.  SLAVE WAGON - ROMAN STREETS - DAY

Maximus and the other gladiators are in a slave cart on

the way from the arena.  A gang of children run alongside

the cart, cheering and chanting:

The drums continue...

INT.  PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - CELL - NIGHT

Maximus and Juba are with Lucilla and Gracchus.  Lucilla

is writing on a piece of parchment.

A beat.

A beat.

A beat.

A long beat.

A beat.

The drums continue...

EXT.  COLOSSEUM - ARENA - DAY

Vibius defeats an opponent -- he stands over him.  He

looks around at the crowd.  Then he tosses down his sword

and walks off.

The crowd goes mad with pleasure.  Vibius eats it up,

raising his arms and soaking up the applause.

Maximus watches from the holding cells.  He smiles.

The drums continue...

EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

Proximo supervises as a huge banner is unfurled.  It

covers the side of a tall building.

It shows a dramatic painting of Maximus.

Proximo supervises happily as torches and braziers are lit

to illuminate the mammoth banner.

The drums continue...

EXT.  COLOSSEUM - ARENA - DAY

The ending of a group fight -- Proximo's gladiators

triumphant.

The crowd waits for the delicious act of defiance.  We

note many placard and banners honoring "MAXIMUS THE

MERCIFUL."

Maximus, Vibius, Juba and a few other gladiators toss down

their weapons and walk off, leaving their opponents alive.

The crowd roars.  They have completely embraced Maximus

and his fellow gladiators.

Gracchus, in the stands, laughs.

The drums finally conclude.

INT.  PALACE - LUCILLA'S CHAMBER - DAY

Lucilla is with her HANDMAIDEN.  They sit before a large

mirror, the Handmaiden perfecting Lucilla's makeup for the

day.

One of Commodus' Centurion Body Guards enters, bows.

Lucilla quickly glances to her Handmaiden in the mirror

and then braces herself, stands, and quickly leaves with

the Centurion.

INT.  PALACE - HALLWAY - DAY

Lucilla strides quickly, nervously, down the long corridor

to Commodus' chambers.  She enters...

INT.  PALACE - COMMODUS' BEDROOM - DAY

Commodus is wrapped in a sheet, gazing out a window.

He turns.  She stops.

He looks as if he has not slept for days.  If a word could

now sum up his clouded face it is this:  tormented.

She goes to him, embraces him.  He holds her tightly.

He moves away from her, slowly moving around the room.

A beat.  Commodus' strange philosophical bent is unnerving

Lucilla.

A beat.  He stands before a bust of Marcus Aurelius.  He

touches it.

A beat.

A beat.

Commodus continues to slowly move around the room.

This odd statement hangs in the air for a moment.  Then:

He stops.  Looks at her.

Something in her words has struck a chord in him.

He looks at her.

EXT.  COLOSSEUM - ARENA - DAY

Maximus is fighting a thick GIANT of a man.  A few quick

blows and the Giant falls -- like a mighty tree he crashes

to the sand.

The arena cheers their hero.

Maximus stands over the beaten Giant.  The crowd waits for

the famous act.

Maximus salutes the Giant and tosses down his sword,

refusing to kill.  He walks away.

The arena explodes in cheers -- a chant of "Maximus the

Merciful" grows to deafening proportions.

Suddenly the arena is filled with Praetorians -- they

block Maximus' exit from the arena -- the crowd boos --

horrified --

The Praetorians surround Maximus.  He is unarmed, but

coils for the inevitable battle.

Then the Praetorians part...

And Commodus walks through them.  He carries something

wrapped in a rich cloth.  Maximus glares at him.

The Praetorians move back and the crowd watches eagerly.

The Emperor and the Gladiator, at last.

Maximus and Commodus stare at each other.  The crowd

cannot hear what is said, but strain to observe this

incredible confrontation.

Maximus doesn't answer.

Commodus unwraps the cloth bundle.  Inside is a small

wooden sword.  He holds it up so the crowd can see.

A collective gasp.  The wooden sword, prized by all

gladiators above all else.  Freedom.

He holds out the wooden sword.  A beat.

A beat.

Commodus visibly flinches at that, but still holds the

wooden sword out.  The crowd is breathless.

With that, Maximus does the unimaginable.  He simply turns

his back on the Emperor and walks away.

And the crowd goes mad.  They cheer the defiant gladiator,

their champion.

And, equally, they deride the Emperor.  They mock him by

holding out food and trash like Commodus is holding out

the wooden sword.  They laugh and jeer.

Commodus glances around at his children, lost.

Then he turns to the Imperial Box.  He sees Lucilla

slipping out the back of the box.  He watches her go.

And the crowd continues to jeer.

EXT.  STREET THEATER - NIGHT

The crowd laughs riotously as Roman Actors perform a

typically ribald comedy in a secluded street:

An outrageously dressed version of Maximus is parading

around on an outrageously dressed version of Commodus,

riding him like a donkey and slapping his rear with a

wooden sword.  The "Commodus" actor mews and brays and

wails like an infant.

Captain Marcellus of the City Guard gallops past them, on

his way out of Rome.

EXT.  PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - COURTYARD - DAY

Maximus stands with Juba and Vibius.  He draws a circle in

the sand with a stick.  He draws a line to the circle.

Maximus draws a line to the Imperial Box.

A beat.

Maximus points to the huge statue of Mars.

A beat.  Vibius thinks about it.

INT.  PALACE - LUCILLA'S CHAMBERS - EVENING

Commodus sweeps in.  Thinks Lucilla is standing there.

The woman turns, it is Lucilla's Handmaiden.

Commodus looks at her for a moment.

And then he slowly walks right to her.  His face an inch

away from hers.

INT.  PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - PROXIMO'S CHAMBER - NIGHT

Proximo sits, considering Maximus.

A beat.

A beat.

Something flashes across Proximo's eyes, something like

tragedy.

A pause.

A beat.

Proximo suddenly begins to weep rather histrionically --

Maximus is a bit taken aback -- Proximo dramatically

flicks tears from his eyes -- and then can't keep the show

up -- he bursts into laughter.

Maximus stares at him.

Maximus can only laugh as well.

Maximus shakes his head, smiling, and goes.

Proximo sits for a moment.

Then he rises and goes to a heavy chest.  He looks at the

chest for a moment and then opens it.

Inside is his old Lorica Segmentata.  He gazes at his

armor, considering what he once was.  And what he now is.

INT.  PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - CELL - NIGHT

Maximus enters.  Lucilla is waiting, extremely tense.

A pause.

A beat.

She leans against a wall.

A pause.

A long beat.

He steps to her.

A beat.

A long, difficult beat.  She fights back tears.

He puts a gentle finger to her lips.

He holds her closely, tenderly.

INT.  PALACE - LUCILLA'S CHAMBERS - NIGHT

Lucilla enters, deep in thought, still drained from her

meeting with Maximus.

She suddenly stops.  Frozen.

Commodus is sitting across the chamber, Lucius at his

knee.  An open scroll on Commodus' lap.

Lucilla has not moved.

Lucilla goes to them, sits.

Lucilla looks as if she is going to be ill.

Lucius is busy scanning the scroll.  Commodus gently

strokes his hair, his cold eyes never leaving Lucilla's.

Lucilla's face is tortured.

INT.  PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - PROXIMO'S CHAMBER - NIGHT

Proximo is asleep -- a sound outside wakes him -- the

steady clip-clop of horses on stone.  A lot of horses.

He rises and goes to a window overlooking the street

outside.

A stern Praetorian Guard cavalry unit is cantering into

position at his gates.  Proximo grabs his clothes --

EXT.  PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - NIGHT

With cool military precision the Praetorians take up

position at the gates before Proximo's compound, an

unassailable line.  They quickly prepare their bows.

Meanwhile, another Praetorian unit has taken up position

at the other end of Proximo's compound -- sealing that

entrance as well.

EXT.  PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - COURTYARD - NIGHT

Proximo is hurrying across his open courtyard when the

first flaming arrow arches into the compound -- it is

followed by hundreds more --

The Praetorians on either end of his compound keep up a

ceaseless hail of flaming arrows -- everything begins to

burn -- the caged gladiators are stirring now --

shouting --

Proximo races to his panicked guards --

The guards sprint to the cells -- unlocking the gladiators

as quickly as they can --

Not quick enough for many -- Praetorians are now pouring

pitch through the gutter that runs along the bottom of the

cells -- igniting it and incinerating all those trapped

inside --

The compound is soon a raging inferno --

Proximo releases Maximus and Juba --

Proximo hauls Maximus and Juba off as Vibius and the other

gladiators arm themselves --

INT.  TUNNELS - NIGHT

Proximo is leading Maximus and Juba quickly through a

decaying cramped tunnel.

Maximus stops as well.

Maximus nods.

He leads Maximus down the disintegrating catacomb of

tunnels --

EXT.  PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - NIGHT

Vibius hoped to die fighting -- he never got the chance.

It is not a battle, it is a slaughter.

The Praetorians ruthlessly shoot anyone even approaching

the gates -- all the walls are covered -- most of the

gladiators die in the hellish inferno -- the relentless

rain of flaming arrows continues --

Vibius coughs in the thick smoke and rages for someone to

fight -- Praetorian snipers cut him down -- he dies

reaching for the statue of Mars.

INT.  COLOSSEUM - SUBTERRANEAN - NIGHT

Proximo and Maximus emerge deep in the bowels of the

Colosseum.

He races back into the tunnel.

Maximus moves quickly down the corridor.  He can finally

see...

INT.  COLOSSEUM - BUTCHERY - NIGHT

Grisly carcasses of every description hang from hooks.

Two bored butchers hack them up.  The good bits are tossed

into a wagon to fed to the Colosseum animals.  The waste

and offal are shoveled into a large sewer opening.  A

butcher occasionally lifts a sluice-gate and a gush of

water flows into the sewer from above, washing down the

blood and carcasses.

Maximus crouches and creeps through the nightmare of

hanging carcasses and flies.

When the butchers are looking elsewhere, Maximus creeps to

the sewer opening and climbs in -- he immediately slides

down for a few yards in the slanting, slippery blood

sluice -- out of sight --

Then he thuds to a stop.  He can go no further because the

remains of an animal carcass blocks his way.  He tries to

slither past the carcass --

Finally, one of the butchers above lifts the sluice-gate

and a torrent of water flows down.

Maximus is washed down the hideous sewer.

INT.  TUNNELS - NIGHT

Proximo and Juba are quickly marching back down the tunnel

toward the compound -- they are very close now -- the roar

of flame is heard -- the creak of falling timber -- and

the screams of burning men.  They run.

They round a corner and see there is no way past the world

of flame ahead of them.  The tunnel to the compound has

collapsed.

Proximo leads them up a cramped stairway to...

EXT.  STREET OUTSIDE PROXIMO'S COMPOUND - NIGHT

They emerge through a sewer entrance -- right into the

arms of the Praetorian Guard.  Proximo and Juba are bound.

Proximo sees his compound burning.  Sees the Praetorian

archers taking out any last survivors.  Hears the screams.

INT./ EXT.  VARIOUS LOCATIONS - ARREST MONTAGE - NIGHT

A quick sequence of brutal arrests as Praetorian Guard

units round up many associated with the plot.  And many

that are not.

GAIUS' BEDROOM:  Gaius and his wife are yanked awake and

hauled out.

CHRISTIAN HOME:  A congregation of Christians is chained

together, their secret altar smashed.

CAFE:  Greek Scholars are hauled away from their scrolls.

STREET THEATER:  Actors are dragged off in the midst of a

performance.

GRACCHUS' STEAM ROOM:  Gracchus is enjoying grapes with

his handsome catamite.  A unit of Praetorian bursts in.

Gracchus looks at them.  Sighs.

INT.  PALACE - THRONE ROOM - NIGHT

Commodus stands with Lucius on a balcony overlooking the

city.

The roaring flames of the fire at Proximo's compound can

easily be seen.

He puts his hand on the boy's shoulder.

Behind them, Lucilla sits slumped in a chair.  Her face is

a mask of anguish at what she has been forced to do.

Two Praetorians enter with a bucket.

Commodus goes to them.  He talks quietly with them for a

moment and glances at what they are carrying.

They bring the bucket to Lucilla and set it before her.

Commodus ignores her and goes back to Lucius on the

balcony.

Lucilla glances inside the bucket...

Captain Marcellus' head is floating in brine.  Lucilla

moans.  All is lost.

EXT.  TIBER RIVER - NIGHT

Maximus splashes to the surface of the filthy Tiber,

gasping for air.

Animal carcasses float up next to him.  He grabs onto one

and floats down the gently flowing river.

EXT.  ITALIAN FRONT - CAMP - DAWN

The Wolf of Rome sleeps.  Then its ears rise.  Then its

head.  It sniffs the air.  The wolf slowly rises and

begins loping through the camp.

It passes slumbering soldiers and tents, smoke lazily

drifting up from campfires.

The wolf finally stops and looks up.

Maximus is on a horse.  He climbs down.  The wolf goes to

him and licks his hand.

Maximus begins marching through the camp, the wolf at his

side.  Soldiers stir, amazed to see their General is

alive.

Gallus leaps up, stunned, and goes to Maximus.  They

continue to march through the camp, more and more

astonished soldiers joining them.

They march toward the large tents at the center of the

encampment.

Titus emerges from his tent.  Slams to a stop --

He goes to Maximus and embraces him.

Just then Quintus emerges from the largest tent.  He

stares at Maximus, unbelieving.

A long beat as they look at each other.

Quintus knows his destiny.  With quiet dignity he begins

whispering a prayer.  Maximus moves to him, embracing him:

He stabs Quintus with a dagger as he embraces him.

Quintus falls.

A beat.

Titus goes to the dead Quintus and pulls the seal of

office from his uniform.  He hands it to Maximus.

An enormous roar of celebration from the Felix Regiment.

INT.  PALACE - COMMODUS' BEDROOM - MORNING

A castrati choir sings a gentle hymn of celebration.

Their eerie voices and otherworldly harmonies undulate

around Commodus' bedroom.

The Emperor himself is in a chair, wrapped in a robe.  His

body slaves work over him closely.

He is staring into a mirror, lost in another world as the

slaves carefully apply golden eye makeup to him.

The castrati hymn continues...

EXT.  OUTSIDE THE COLOSSEUM - DAY

The hymn is all we hear as we see crowds moving into the

Colosseum...

It seems that all of Rome is here for this great day.

Huge throngs of citizens move like a massive wave toward

the Colosseum entrances.  Vendors are doing brisk

business.  Praetorian units in full dress uniform canter

past.

We elegantly float up along the outer tiers of the

Colosseum and then glide over the edge to see the arena

stands...

EXT.  COLOSSEUM - DAY

The hymn is all we hear as we see...

The stands are filling.  We see the rich and poor alike.

We see the orator Cassius.  We see Senator Falco and most

of the Senate.  We see the cohort of fifty Praetorian

taking up position around the Imperial Box.

A golden platform, with stairs down to the arena sand, now

extends about twenty feet from the Imperial Box to a spot

over the arena.

We float down the stairs and then we see the arena

itself...

It is stunning in its simplicity.

The days victims are tied to posts in the center of the

arena.  Suspended above them is an enormous cloud.  A

thick, tumescent bladder painted to look like a

threatening rain cloud.

We see Proximo and Juba.  We see Senators Gracchus and

Gaius.  We see Gaius' wife and Gracchus catamite and

Christian families and scholars and actors.

Seven stylized hills surround them.

The hymn comes to its soaring conclusion as we see the

damned.

TIME CUT:

Later.  By now, the Colosseum is packed.  All fifty-five

thousand seats are taken.  Another ten thousand stand

wherever they can.  A feral anticipation buzzes through

the crowd.

Outside the Colosseum, the streets are crowded with

thousands more who couldn't get in.

Trumpets blare.

Commodus' six Centurion Body Guards stride into the

Imperial Box.

Then Commodus enters.  He is shrouded in a full lion's

skin, the head of the lion concealing his own.  His head

is down, he does not look up.

Lucilla and Lucius enter after him and sit.  Lucilla's

face is drained, her eyes defeated.  Lucius is wearing a

miniature set of Lorica Segmentata, complete with

ceremonial dagger.

EXT.  ROMAN STREET - DAY

A mangy dog is slowly crossing a dusty street on the

outskirts of Rome.  The street is deserted.  It seems that

almost everyone is at the Colosseum.

The dog stops.  Looks up.

Then a sound is heard.  The steady cadence of horses'

hooves.

The Felix Regiment rounds a corner.  Maximus leads the

cavalry.  He wears Lorica Segmentata.  His corps of

archers and soldiers follow.  They troop down the dusty

street.

Maximus and the cavalry canter past the mystified dog.

QUICK CUTS:

The Felix Regiment moves through the streets.  The few

pedestrians quickly disappear into shops and around

corners.  The roar of the Colosseum can be heard far in

the distance...

Arrows slice into isolated Praetorian sentries.  The Felix

Regiment continues its stealth invasion...

Finally, Maximus reins his horse and his troops stop.

The mounted City Guard are waiting.

Without a word, the City Guard joins Maximus and the two

combined forces continue their inexorable march to the

Colosseum.

EXT.  COLOSSEUM - DAY

Commodus, still swathed in the lion skin, his head down,

slowly walks out on the platform that now extends from the

Imperial Box.

The crowd grows hushed.

Commodus reaches the end of the platform and waits for a

moment.  Then he dramatically flings off the lion skin.

The crowd gasps.

He is almost naked, his entire chiseled body is painted in

gold.  His eyes are lost in an eerie reverie as he looks

around at his people.

He finally speaks:

The crowd is stunned.  A few scattered laughs.

Lucilla stares at him, disbelieving.

EXT.  ROMAN STREETS - DAY

Maximus continues to lead the combined Felix Regiment and

City Guard cavalry through the streets.  The roaring is

closer now.  They are nearing the Colosseum, they can just

glimpse the edge of the top tier over some building.

EXT.  COLOSSEUM - DAY

Commodus continues:

He raises his arms.  At his cue the Praetorian archers

raise their bows, ready, aiming at the victims.

The Praetorians suddenly point their bows higher and

fire --

They shoot the cloud -- the bladder EXPLODES and thick

blood rains down on the victims -- the blood splashes over

them, coating them.

EXT.  OUTSIDE COLOSSEUM - DAY

The roar from the Colosseum is now deafening as Maximus

and the City Guard round the final corner -- the Colosseum

is before them -- the massive Praetorian Guard force is

caught of guard -- with crisp military efficiency the

Felix Regiment and the City Guard quickly canter into

place, an unbroken line of seasoned warriors facing the

Praetorians.

The huge mob outside the Colosseum is confused, intrigued,

watching the face-off.  The mounted archers of the Felix

Regiment have drawn their bows.

Maximus looks down from his horse at a Praetorian Officer.

A beat.

The Praetorian Officer glances at the formidable force

against him.  He drops his sword.  His men follow suit.

He spurs his horse and the Felix Regiment roars, springing

into action -- they gallop through the crowd and to the

Colosseum -- meanwhile the City Guard disarm and guard the

Praetorian --

EXT.  COLOSSEUM - DAY

Commodus continues:

At his cue, two elevator platforms rumble into view,

rising from the bowels of the Colosseum to the arena sand.

On each platform is a cage full of ferocious wolves, they

snap and growl, straining to be released.

Suddenly -- the huge wooden doors of the arena burst open

and Maximus leads the Felix Regiment cavalry thundering

into the arena.

The crowd is stunned -- Commodus is stunned -- Lucilla

bolts up --

Commodus immediately spins to Lucilla, his eyes burning --

His Praetorian are momentarily confused --

At Gallus' command the Felix Regiment archers let fly --

multiple arrows and bolts cut through most of the

Praetorians -- some confusing skirmishes as the remaining

Praetorians fire back --

Maximus leaps from his horse and begins cutting the

prisoners free --

Meanwhile, Commodus strides back down the platform toward

Lucilla in the Imperial Box, murder in his eyes --

She suddenly hugs Lucius quickly and kisses him --

She pulls the ceremonial dagger from his little uniform

and pushes him to his attendant -- his attendant pulls him

away as --

Lucilla spins to Commodus -- he grabs her into an embrace

-- he turns the knife on her -- thrusting deeply as he

kisses her --

A long kiss as he holds her tightly to him.  Then he

gently sits her down on her throne.  Her eyes wide, dying.

One of Commodus' Body Guards grabs him:

Commodus' six Centurion Body Guards begin hustling him out

of the Imperial Box --

He grabs Lucius from his attendant and drags him off --

They try to escape out the back of the Imperial Box -- but

Felix Regiment troops are blocking their way -- racing up

toward them --

Below, through the confusion, Maximus sees Commodus

escaping with Lucius down through a side tunnel.

Maximus cuts Juba and Proximo free.  Juba immediately

snatches up a sword.  Maximus quickly offers a sword to

Proximo.

Proximo takes the sword.

They race across the arena and into a tunnel...

INT.  COLOSSEUM - BOWELS - DAY

Proximo leads them through a series of catacombs -- damp

tunnels shoot off in every direction -- everywhere around

them the heavy machinery of the games rise like mammoth

creatures to the arena above -- a baroque network of ropes

and pulleys and counterweights and elevator platforms and

air shafts and blood sewers -- And they suddenly run

directly into Commodus, dragging Lucius, and his six

Centurions coming the other direction.

The final battle begins with no preamble --

Maximus launches himself forward -- instantly separating

Commodus and Lucius -- he slams at Commodus with his sword

-- Commodus slams back --

Proximo and Juba race into the six Centurions -- a wild

free-for-all as they prove their worth as warriors -- Juba

fights with his usual elegant precision -- Proximo fights

as a man reborn, alive again --

Proximo takes cagey advantage of his knowledge of this

subterranean world -- spinning around machinery and

leaping over blood sewers and swinging heavy

counterweights --

Maximus and Commodus hack at each other with all the fiery

passion in them -- Commodus is a perfect match for Maximus

and equally ruthless -- their swords thrust and parry and

slice at amazing speed -- one false move, one mistake,

means death --

Meanwhile, the battle is turning into a victory for Juba

and Proximo -- they are defeating the Centurions --

Commodus sees this -- and sees Lucius crying in a

corner --

He screams to one of his remaining Centurions:

Maximus whirls to Lucius -- Commodus attacks -- slashing

Maximus' shoulders -- Maximus sees Proximo racing to try

and save Lucius as he spins back to battle Commodus --

A Centurion raises his sword to kill Lucius -- Juba kills

his final opponent, turns -- Proximo just manages to push

Lucius out of the way -- the Centurion's sword slices into

him --

Juba flings his sword across the room -- the final

Centurion falls --

Maximus sees Proximo collapse to a wall -- dying --

Proximo locks eyes with Maximus as he slides down the

wall.  The old pirate shrugs.  And is dead.

Juba races to Lucius and holds the boy, turning his face

away from the slaughter --

Maximus, his furious passion redoubled at Proximo's death,

attacks Commodus with every ounce of strength in him --

Commodus' eyes begin to flash with something we have never

seen before, fear.

Maximus strikes mercilessly -- forcing Commodus steadily

back until they are fighting atop one of the elevator

platforms to the arena above.

Maximus strike hard -- Commodus barely blocks the blow --

He strikes harder -- Commodus is losing --

He strikes with everything he's got -- slashing Commodus

-- Commodus sails back -- his sword falling --

Maximus stands over him.  Glaring.  Commodus is panting,

defeated, glaring up at him.

A beat.

Maximus raises his sword high -- Commodus raises an arm --

Maximus SMASHES the sword down -- and Commodus is dead.

A moment as Maximus stands over Commodus.  Then he looks

at the series of counterweight ropes around the elevator

platform.

He slices through one of the ropes and the platform begins

to rise...

EXT.  COLOSSEUM - ARENA - DAY

A trap door springs open and the elevator platform rises

to the sand of the arena.  Maximus stands above the dead

Emperor.

The crowd stares in amazement -- and then begins to cheer

in joy at the return of their hero.  A chant begins...

"Maximus the Merciful... Maximus the Merciful... Maximus

the Merciful..." which then grows to a refrain of

"Caesar... Caesar... Caesar..."

Maximus ignores them, his eyes drawn to one sight:

Lucilla.

He goes to the steps of the platform leading to the

Imperial Box.  He slowly climbs the steps.

In the Imperial Box, Senator Gracchus is standing.  So too

Juba and others.

Lucius is kneeling by his mother, holding her hand, his

head down.  Lucilla is dead.  Lucius mourns with quiet

dignity.

Maximus looks at Lucilla and kneels.  He takes her other

hand.  A long moment.  He looks at Lucius.

Then he slowly bends forward and kisses Lucilla deeply,

the ritual farewell.

He stands.

Senator Gracchus steps to him:

Maximus looks at him.  And then at the people.  The chant

of "Caesar... Caesar... Caesar..." is like a powerful

beating heart.

Maximus moves to the edge of the Imperial Box to address

the people.  The crowd grows silent.

Maximus looks around at the blood of the arena.

A beat.

With that he slowly turns and walks down the steps to the

arena sand.  The crowd is absolutely silent.

He goes to Titus:

Titus salutes.

Maximus return the salute and then leaps onto his horse.

As he canters toward the exit he turns for one final look

at Lucilla.

He sees that Lucius is now at the foot of the stairs, on

the arena sand, gazing at him.

Maximus stops his horse.

He canters back to Lucius.  The boy looks up at him.  A

moment between them.

Lucius thrusts up his hand.  Maximus grabs his hand and

swings him onto the horse behind him.

A look to Juba.  Juba bows his head with respect.

Farewell.

Maximus spins the horse around and begins cantering out of

the Colosseum.

Juba disappears into the crowd.

Maximus and Lucius canter across the arena and through the

huge doors...

EXT.  COLOSSEUM - DAY

From high above we see Maximus and Lucius riding out of

the Colosseum and disappearing into the streets of Rome.

EXT.  VINEYARD - DAWN

Maximus stands with Lucius at his old vineyard.

It is still scorched and dead, weeds overgrowing the

vineyards, the house ruined.

Maximus puts a hand on the boy's shoulder, this boy so

like his own son.

We leave them, dreaming of the future.
