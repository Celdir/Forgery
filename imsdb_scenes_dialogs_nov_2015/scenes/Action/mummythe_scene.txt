The UNIVERSAL PICTURES globe spins. Then comes to a stop on

the African continent. A golden papyrus MAP of ANCIENT EGYPT

rises up. WE PUSH IN on it, towards a CITY along the Nile,

it's name written in hierarchic. WE KEEP PUSHING IN until

the golden map turns to golden sand and we find ourselves

DESCENDING on this ancient Egyptian city. Only it's not

ancient.

SUPERIMPOSED across the SCREEN are the WORDS.

Accompanied by a NARRATOR with a very thick Egyptian accent:

The CAMERA sets-down in an open plaza. An Arabian horse-drawn

CHARIOT comes barreling right at us, driven by PHARAOH SETI;

an aristocratic, virile old man. The chariot WIPES FRAME.

INT. ANCK-SU-NAMUN'S BALCONY WINDOW - PALACE - DUSK

Glaring out over the city at the setting sun is a handsome,

muscular MAN with intense, evil eyes. This is IMHOTEP.

A gorgeous, olive-skinned goddess enters the outer foyer. It

takes us a moment to realize that the skin-tight dress she's

wearing isn't a dress at all, but rather her entire naked

body has been PAINTED in the ancient Egyptian manner She's a

stunning sight to behold. This is ANCK-SU-NAMUN.

She makes her way through the ornate statuary. The CAMERA

comes to a stop on a CRACKED STONE FACE. A BEAT. And then

it's eyes suddenly POP OPEN. It's really a strange looking

TATTOOED MAN. Several more of these hideous, bald MEN stand

nearby. They are the PRIESTS of Osiris. Imhotep's guys. Their

eyes watch Anck-su-namun vanish through the bedroom curtains.

Anck-su-namun embraces Imhotep, they kiss passionately,

feverishly. Imhotep's hands roam over her perfect body,

smearing the paint. The Narrator's VOICE fills with lust:

And we realize that the Narrator is actually Imhotep himself

on the other-side of the curtains, the bald Priests rush

over and close the doors. But just as they do, the doors

suddenly BURST OPEN. Pharaoh angrily strides in, looks at

the Priests. The following DIALOGUE is in ANCIENT EGYPTIAN, --

SUBTITLED.

The Priests back away, scared shitless, obviously his arrival

was unexpected. Pharaoh strides for the curtains. Throws

them back.

Anck-su-namun stands alone. Gives him a sexy smile. Pharaoh

sees the smeared body paint. Points his finger.

From behind him, his sword is ripped out of its scabbard.

Pharaoh spins around. It's Imhotep. Pharaoh is shocked.

Behind him, Anck-su-namun lifts a dagger and plunges it into

his back.

Pharaoh SCREAMS. Imhotep raises Pharaoh's sword. The hideous

bald Priests SLAM the doors and bolt them tight. Through the

curtains, they see the SHADOWS of Anck-su-namun and Imhotep

stab away at Pharaoh. Suddenly, the doors are RAMMED from

the other side, --WHAM! Imhotep and Anck-su-namun turn and

look. --WHAM! The doors are RAMMED again. The two lovers

share desperate looks. --WHAM! The bald Priests run up and

grab Imhotep and try and pull him towards the balcony.

Imhotep tries to break free, but Anck-su-namun rips Pharaoh's

sword out of his hand and pushes him towards the balcony.

Imhotep's face fills with despair. The DOORS EXPLODE OPEN.

MEN with BLUE-TINTED SKIN and strange PUZZLE-TATTOOS over

their bodies stride in, armed to the teeth. These are the

MUMIA. The Priests hustle Imhotep out onto the dark balcony

just as the Mumia rip through the curtains.

Anck-su-namun points at Pharaoh and hisses --

She PLUNGES the sword into her own heart. Out on the balcony,

Imhotep's mouth opens into a horrible silent scream...

EXT. SAND DUNES - NIGHT

Imhotep leads-a TORCH-LIT procession across the dunes. Anck-

su-namun's mummy is carried by NUBIAN SLAVES. They put her

down in the sand along with FIVE JEWEL ENCRUSTED JARS.

Imhotep, filled with dread, reads from a OBOOKO made out of

pure GOLD. THIS IS THE BOOK OF THE LIVING.

Strange LIGHT suddenly FLASHES across the faces of the slaves

and the EGYPTIAN SOLDIERS. Suddenly, everyone's fear-filled

eyes all rise, as if watching Anck-su-namun's body rising.

Then one last HUGE FLASH, accompanied by a BLAST OF WIND,

and it's over. Anck-su-namun's body now lies twisted on the

ground.

Imhotep's Priests place the body into a stone sarcophagus.

The Nubian slaves lower it into a hole and bury it with sand.

Imhotep then signals to the Soldiers, who throw their spears

at the Nubians. Killing them.

Imhotep's knife-wielding Priests attack the now unarmed

Soldiers, hacking at them in the flickering darkness as

Imhotep and the Mumia solemnly watches.

The Mumia walk off across the sand and then, one by one, the

Priests stop their frenzied stabbing and stare off at the

vanishing Mumia. As the last Mumia disappears over a distant

dune, Imhotep nods, and the Priests leap onto Anck-su-namun's

grave and begin digging it back up with their hands.

EXT. SAHARA DESERT - NIGHT

CHARIOTS race out into the moonlit desert. Imhotep leads the

way. A "hearse" carries Anck-su-namun's mummy. THE MAP OF

ANCIENT EGYPT FADES UP. The chariots race across the map.

The chariots arrive at a place marked on the map in hieratic.

They race up the stone ramp and in through the city gates.

SUPERIMPOSED across the SCREEN are the WORDS:

EXT. HAMUNAPTRA - ANUBIS SITE - NIGHT

Imhotep pulls an ORNATE CHEST out of a SECRET COMPARTMENT

inside the giant STATUE OF ANUBIS. He opens the chest and

lifts out THE BOOK OF THE DEAD, made of black stone.

INT. UNDERGROUND NECROPOLIS - NIGHT

Big hairy RATS scurry through the mausoleums and over the

headstones of this very large, scary, UNDERGROUND CEMETERY.

A DETRITUS MOAT surrounds the cemetery, -- muck made out of

filthy water and human remains. Skulls bob in the goop. The

Priests have gathered in a circle. Their hooded, lifeless

eyes seem dead to this world. Their bald heads rock back and

forth as they CHANT, a quiet eerie HUM. Heinous creatures.

In the middle of the circle is a strange, twisted ALTAR.

Imhotep has unwrapped Anck-su-namun's gorgeous, lifeless

body and placed her five sacred canopic jars around her.

As Imhotep begins to read from The Book of The Dead, a large

SWIRLING HOLE starts to open in the detritus bog. Several

Priests look over at it, frightened, then quickly look back

down and resume CHANTING. A strange MIST wafts up out of the

swirling hole and over to the jars, it passes through them

and into Anck-su-namun's body. One of the jars SHUDDERS, the

heart inside begins to BEAT. The CHANTING PRIESTS, SWIRLING

HOLE, WAFTING MIST, BEATING HEART and IMHOTEP'S READINGS are

reaching a crescendo. Anck-su-namun's EYES suddenly FLY OPEN.

Imhotep lifts a sacrificial knife above Anck-su-namun's

breast, about to plunge it down. The CHANTING, SWIRLING and

BEATING heart CLIMAX. And that's when the Mumia BURST IN and

storm through the startled Priests. The HEAD MUMIA SMASHES

the jar with the beating heart. The MIST instantly sucks

back out of Anck-su-namun's body and IMPLODES back into the

swirling hole.

Anck-su-namun's eyes close. Dying once again. Imhotep SCREAMS

in rage. The Mumia grab him and his Priests.

INT. EMBALMING CHAMBER (NECROPOLIS RE-VAMP) - NIGHT

Inside a TORCH-LIT CHAMBER, Imhotep is held by Anubis-headed

EMBALMERS. He cringes at the flickering, impressionistic

glimpses of his Priests being embalmed and mummified alive.

The horrid-looking Embalmers, using knives, needles and

thread, calmly perform their ghastly surgery on the SCREAMING

Priests, who are going insane from the procedure.

A red hot POKER is pulled out of a pit of burning coals.

A Priest's head is wedged between two strong boards. His

eyes widen in terror as an Embalmer moves to insert the red

hot poker up his nose.

But just before he does, WE QUICKLY CUT TO IMHOTEP'S FACE,

horrified, as OFF CAMERA, the Priest SCREAMS.

WE GO WIDE on the chamber. All twenty-one of Imhotep's Priests

squirm inside their wrappings. Imhotep is forced to his knees.

His arms are held back. His mouth is pried open.

Using a pair of tongs, an Embalmer slowly pulls Imhotep's

TONGUE out of his mouth, then places a very sharp knife on

top of it. WE GO TIGHT on IMHOTEP'S EYES as his tongue is

apparently cut out. The Embalmer flings Imhotep's tongue

onto the floor. The Mumia's dogs attack and quickly eat it.

Imhotep is WRAPPED ALIVE. Only his mouth, nostrils and

fearfilled eyes are left free of the slimy bandages. Detritus

muck boils inside a black cauldron. Embalmers scoop out the

fetid muck and apply it to Imhotep's wrappings as he squirms.

He's then laid in a wooden COFFIN inside a stone SARCOPHAGUS.

An Embalmer with a BUCKET steps up and looks into the coffin.

Imhotep's wild eyes stare back. The Embalmer empties the

bucket over Imhotep's chest: dozens of SCARABS, disgusting

dung beetles. They scurry across Imhotep's SCREAMING face.

Some vanish into his tongue-less mouth and up his nostrils.

The lid to the coffin is SLAMMED SHUT. Then, using a strange

four-sided KEY, the Head Mumia locks the coffin lid tight.

The heavy sarcophagus lid is shoved into place and with a

loud WHOOSH seals itself airtight. Once again, the Head Mumia

uses the strange key, locking the sarcophagus lid tight.

The blue-skinned, strangely tattooed man carefully collapses

the sides of the key, -- turning it into a little puzzle

BOX.

Imhotep's sarcophagus is dropped into a DETRITUS PIT. The

disgusting muck SPLASHES up, drools down it-s sides, and

then is mysteriously sucked into It's seams, vanishing clean.

Imhotep's horrifying tongue-less SCREAMS can be heard coming

from inside his sarcophagus as grave diggers shovel dirt

onto it. THE MAIN TITLE IS SUPERIMPOSED ON THE SCREAM:

The heavily armed Mumia stand guard around Imhotep's grave.

Looking down on the burial site is the huge statue of ANUBIS,

the jackal-headed god of death. It stares at us. Then begins

to DECAY before our very eyes, aging 4,159 years in only

seconds. And then we find ourselves and the decrepit, half-

buried statue of Anubis out in the middle of the desert.

EXT. SAHARA - HAMANAPTRA RUINS (1925) - DAY

Imhotep's horrifying SCREAMS become the SCREAMS of a TUAREG

HORSEMAN.

Racing across the desert with two thousand of his warrior

brethren. Armed to the teeth. SUPERIMPOSED across the SCREEN

are the WORDS:

A mile across the scorching desert TWO HUNDRED FRENCH FOREIGN

LEGIONNAIRES scurry through the ruins, preparing for the

onslaught. OUR HERO is up on the wall. His Kepi sits at a

jaunty angle. Dashing and handsome. This is RICK O'CONNELL.

He looks out at the massive SCREAMING horde galloping at

him.

A doughy little Frenchman joins him as he makes his way across

the top of the wall. This is BENI.

Beni pulls off his cartridge belt. Hands it to O'Connell.

O'Connell throws it on, crisscrossing his own bandolier.

Beni pulls out his pistol and chucks it to O'Connell.

O'Connell slides it into his belt, next to his own revolver

O'Connell turns and goes nose-to-nose with him.

The horde of warriors THUNDERS forward. Now a half mile out.

Scimitars RATTLING. O'Connell and Beni run through the ruins.

Beni trips and accidentally tackles O'Connell to the ground.

O'Connell gives him a nasty look.

They get up and run out the gate and down the stone ramp

They both skid to a stop at the front line as they see the

horde of warriors. The SOUND of CHARGING HORSES is deafening.

O'Connell gives Beni a big cheesy smile.

And that's when the cowardly Legionnaire Colonel suddenly

panics, cuts and runs. O'Connell instantly stiffens.

Gives the men around him courage. But onward comes the horde

Hoofs pounding the sand. Several more Legionnaires take off.

The Tuaregs let loose with those horrifying oooo-loo-loog

SCREAMS. More Legionnaires haul-ass. Beni is one of them.

The Tuaregs set their rifles and take aim. O'Connell steels

himself, cocks and locks. The cartridge in his mouth suddenly

snaps, he spits it into the sand. Another BEAT. And then --

The Legionnaires on the ground FIRE. The rifles report with

a CRASH. The BLAST blows dozens of Tuaregs clean off their

mounts. The prone Legionnaires quickly begin to reload.

The kneeling Legionnaires FIRE. More Tuaregs bite the sand.

The remaining warriors OPEN FIRE. THUNDER and SMOKE rip the

hot air. A third of the Legionnaires are killed instantly.

The remaining standing Legionnaires FIRE. Tuaregs spin off

their mounts. Crash to the sand. And then the entire Tuareg

force plows into the ruins and through the Legionnaires.

O'Connell grabs the barrel of his rifle and starts CLUBBING

riders off their steeds, fighting like a man possessed.

Beni on the other hand, is bellycrawling across the sand,

whimpering in full retreat as Legionnaires fall dead all

around him. He crawls through the front gate.

O'Connell throws his rifle down and goes for his guns. He

cross-draws, gun in each hand, starts blowing riders off

their mounts.

Beni crawls faster, and then he spots an open TEMPLE DOORWAY

amongst the rocks. He gets up and sprints for the door as

the last of the Legionnaires are shot off their feet behind

him. O'Connell's guns go empty.

He turns and runs like hell, right through the front gate.

Four Tuareg warriors on massive Arabians haul-ass after him.

O'Connell hurdles a stone column, hits the ground running.

He spots Beni inside the Temple doorway, trying to close the

heavy sandstone door.

Beni has no intention of waiting up, he pushes harder.

O'Connell runs faster. Beni pushes harder. The four Horsemen

LEAP the big column and CHARGE after him. HOOFS POUNDING.

Beni closes the door just as O'Connell reaches it. O'Connell

SLAMS his body into the door. It doesn't budge.

He turns and bolts off around the rocks. Running for his

life, weaving through the ruins. The Arabians getting closer

and closer. The POUNDING hoofs getting LOUDER and LOUDER.

O'Connell finally spins around and faces his attackers. The

four massive horses crash to a stop in front of him. The

vicious Tuaregs raise their rifles to finish him off.

O'Connell just stands there, exhausted and beaten, then he

slowly lifts his right hand and gives them the bird.

And that's when the horses go ape-shit. All four of them

REAR UP. Two of the Riders are THROWN to the ground. The

horses SCREECH and BELLOW and SNORT in fear, then buck like

fury and haul-ass away as if the devil himself had scared

them. The thrown Riders get up and race off after their

mounts.

O'Connell just stands there, stunned, then he lifts his right

hand and checks out his middle finger. And then he feels the

evil himself, and turns around. -- The shattered, decrepit

statue of Anubis stares back at him.

Suddenly, the sand begins to shift under O'Connell's feet.

He starts to back away, keeping his eyes on the transforming

sand, it looks like huge snakes are wiggling and writhing

beneath it, forming lines and shapes, -- drawing a picture.

O'Connell quickly turns and runs off through the ruins. The

sand stops moving, and we can now see that, drawn in the

sand, is a picture of IMHOTEP'S SCREAMING FACE.

EXT. RIDGE - DAY

Up on a ridge, A GROUP OF RIDERS watch O'Connell stumble

clear of the decrepit city. O'Connell feels their presence

and looks up. Very different from the Tuaregs, they have

BLUE TINTED SKIN and faces covered in strange PUZZLE-TATTOOS.

The Mumia. Still watching Imhotep's grave after all this

time.

The MUMIA LEADER is a huge, fierce Man in black robes, with

dual scimitars across his waist. His face is both handsome

and horrible, blue and tattooed. Meet ARDETH RAY. His dark

eyes watch O'Connell stagger off into the open desert...

EXT. CAIRO - DAY

Cairo, a city so old the stars have actually changed their

positions in the sky since it's birth. A city teeming with

every form of life. A strange, mysterious, wonderful city.

WE SUPERIMPOSE it's name across the SCREEN:

INT. CAIRO MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITIES - DAY

Deep in the bowels of the museum lie the STACKS. Rows upon

rows of towering bookshelves. Filled with literature on the

Antiquities. Standing at the top of a tall ladder between

two of these rows and leaning against one of the bookshelves,

is a rather uninteresting British GIRL: eye-glasses, hair-in-

a-bun, long boring dress, your typical prudish nightmare.

This is EVELYN CARNARVON. We're going to fall in love with

her.

Evelyn pulls a book out from a stack under her arm, blows

the dust off it, then places it on a shelf with other books

whose titles all begin with the letter "O". Then she grabs

another book out from under her arm and reads the title.

Carefully, so as not to lose her balance, she looks over her

shoulder to the bookshelf behind her, where all the titles

begin with the letter "T". Then she looks down. It's a long

way to the bottom. Evelyn gently sets the other books down

on the top shelf, then turns and gingerly starts to reach

across the aisle with the Tuthmosis book. It's a little too

far, so she stretches, reaching, holding the top of the ladder

with her fingertips, she's almost got it, closer now closer.

And that's when the ladder pulls away from the shelf. Evelyn

YELPS, flings the Tuthmosis book and grabs the top of the

ladder, which stands straight up. Evelyn holds her breath,

swaying precariously, a long BEAT, and then she loses her

balance, the ladder swings around and Evelyn starts

stiltwalking down the aisle.

The ladder crosses the aisle, does an about face and heads

back the way it came. Evelyn clings to the top, struggling

for balance. The ladder teeters out into the main aisle and

picks up speed. Evelyn SCREAMS as it does a 180, spins into

another aisle and finally crashes to a stop at the top of a

bookshelf. Evelyn holds her breath, then SIGHS HEAVILY.

And that's when the bookshelf falls away from her and CRASHES

into the next bookshelf.

Evelyn slides down the ladder and plops to the floor. She

looks up just as the domino effect kicks-in: each bookshelf

crashing into the next. And onward it goes. Bookshelf after

bookshelf. Thousands of volumes flinging off shelves and

scattering across the floor. It finally ends as the last

shelf CRASHES into a wall. Evelyn's eyes are closed. She

opens one eye. Looks left. Then right. Then opens the other

eye and stares at the huge mess.

The Egyptian CURATOR storms in.

Evelyn quickly gets up and starts gathering books.

Evelyn turns to him, trying to contain herself.

The Curator storms out. Evelyn just stands there, steaming.

And then she hears a NOISE and quickly turns around. A BEAT.

Quiet. Eerie. And then she hears it again, like feet, slowly

shuffling across the floor, coming from a nearby gallery.

Evelyn walks through the stacks and enters --

INT. THE RAMESSEUM

Filled with treasures and plunder from the Middle Kingdom.

It's very dark and quiet in here, the only LIGHT is from

FLICKERING TORCHES at either end of the spooky gallery.

The NOISE again! From the far side of the room. Feet, slowly

shuffling, plodding across the floor. Evelyn grabs a torch.

Looks around, at a statue of Anubis, another of Horus, they

stare down at Evelyn, who is starting to get scared now. She

walks down the aisle. Past a closed sarcophagus. Past cases

of ancient artifacts. Past another sarcophagus, -- only this

one is OPEN! Evelyn freezes, swallows hard, nervously looks

around to see who could have opened it. Then she slowly leans

forward with the torch, and peers inside.

-- A hideous rotted MUMMY sits up and SCREECHES at her!

Evelyn SCREAMS, drops the torch and backs away, scared out

of her wits. And then, coming from inside the sarcophagus,

she hears a Man LAUGHING. Her eyes narrow as a foppish cad

crawls out from behind the Mummy, laughing his ass off, half

drunk.

Meet JONATHAN CARNARVON. As he crawls out of the sarcophagus,

Evelyn pulls a cigarette out of the mummy's mouth.

He grins drunkenly. Evelyn punches him hard in the chest.

He BELCHES, then falls back and sits on the edge of a tomb.

Jonathan excitedly starts scrounging around in his jacket.

Jonathan pulls out a small, ancient BOX; the collapsed KEY

to Imhotep's sarcophagus and coffin. Evelyn is instantly

curious, she grabs the box out of his hand.

Jonathan knows her weaknesses, gives her a mischievous smile.

Evelyn rolls the box around in her hands, mumbling to herself

as she translates the hieratics and hieroglyphs covering it.

Jonathan licks his lips in anticipation.

Evelyn's fingers play with the various little slats on the

box, shifting them this way and that way, it's like a puzzle

box. Then suddenly, it UNFOLDS ITSELF, almost-mechanically,

turning itself into the KEY. Sitting inside the open key/box

is a folded piece of GOLDEN PAPYRUS. An ANCIENT MAP.

INT. CURATOR'S OFFICE - DAY

The Curator sits at his desk, staring through a jeweler's

eyepiece at the key/box. Evelyn hovers behind him, excited.

Jonathan leans in from across the desk.

The Curator picks up the MAP. It's actually the exact same

map that we established in the opening scenes of the movie.

The Curator freezes, suddenly very nervous, then he recovers.

The Curator holds the map closer to the burning CANDLE-LAMP.

The map 'accidentally,' CATCHES ON FIRE. The Curator throws

it to the floor. Jonathan drops to his knees and quickly

puts it out. Lifts it up. The left third of the map is now

missing.

The Curator reaches for the key/box. Evelyn quickly snatches

it off the desk and gives him a very angry, suspicious look.

EXT. CAIRO PRISON - GALLOWS COURTYARD - DAY

Cairo prison. One of the worst hell holes on earth. Every

low-life form of scumbag can be found here. The WARDEN, a

first rate scumbag himself, escorts Evelyn and Jonathan across

the gallows courtyard. Evelyn whispers to Jonathan.

EXT. VISITOR'S PEN - DAY

The Warden ushers Evelyn and Jonathan into the holding pen.

The interior cell door BURSTS OPEN. O'Connell is in chains,

dragged by FOUR GUARDS, they shove him up to the cell bars.

From the looks of it, he's been here awhile; his face is

half hidden by long hair, a scraggly beard and many new

bruises. Evelyn looks at him, disgusted by his appearance.

O'Connell gives Evelyn the once over, then looks at Jonathan.

Evelyn is stunned and furious. The Warden heads out the door.

A Guard CLUBS O'Connell across the head, O'Connell's face

bounces off the metal bars. He shows no pain, but just looks

back and gives the Guard a nasty look. Evelyn steps closer.

Evelyn and Jonathan quickly look around, hoping the guards

didn't hear him. They step closer. Evelyn plays coy.

Evelyn is dumbstruck. But Jonathan looks suspicious

O'Connell looks closer at Jonathan, a glint of recognition.

O'Connell's FIST comes flying through the bars, hits Jonathan

square in the jaw, DECKS HIM. He hits the floor. Out cold. A

Guard CLUBS O'Connell. His head bounces off the bars again.

He shows no pain, but gives the Guard another nasty look.

Evelyn looks down at her brother, then back at O'Connell.

O'Connell almost smiles. There's a bit of spark to this girl.

The warden enters. Evelyn quickly leans closer to O'Connell.

Evelyn leans in even closer.

She leans her face right up to the bars, nervous and excited

O'Connell steps forward and KISSES her full on the lips.

Evelyn is stunned. A Guard CLUBS him, his face bounces off

the bars again, but before he can react the Guards GRAB him,

YANKS him away from the bars and DRAG him out of the room.

Evelyn is shocked. The warden shows-off his green teeth.

EXT. GALLOWS COURTYARD - DAY

Hundreds of filthy PRISONERS stare down onto the gallows as

the hangman's noose is draped over O'Connell's head and

cinched tight around his neck. Evelyn follows the warden

onto a balcony above the gallows. The prisoners all go dead

quiet at the sight of her; like jackals staring at fresh

meat.

This seems to confuse the Warden, he shrugs and sits down.

O'Connell looks up as Evelyn plops down beside the Warden.

O'Connell can hear every word, he looks hopeful. Other than

Evelyn, you could hear a pin drop. The HANGMAN turns to him.

The Hangman grabs the lever to the trapdoor.

The Warden sets his greasy, lecherous hand on Evelyn's leg.

Evelyn is revolted, she quickly shoves his hand away.

Insulted, the Warden angrily turns and gestures to the

Hangman, who pulls the lever. The trapdoor DROPS AWAY.

O'Connell DROPS through the hole. The rope pays out. Then

JERKS TAUGHT. O'Connell's body SNAPS at the end of the rope.

But he's still alive, because --

The prisoners go ape-shit, SCREAMING and SHOUTING in anger.

The GUARDS look around, nervous. O'Connell struggles at the

end of the rope, gagging. Evelyn is horrified, she quickly

turns to the warden, leans forward and whispers in his ear.

The warden spins around and faces her.

At the end of the rope, O'Connell is choking and gagging and

turning several shades of red. The Warden stares at Evelyn.

Evelyn hesitates, bites her lip. O'Connell's eyes bulge as

he looks up at her, he can't believe this girl.

The warden flashes a big green smile, then YELLS in Arabic.

A scimitar SLASHES the air. The rope is CUT. O'Connell CRASHES

to the ground. Half dead. Rolls over. GAGGING.

All of the prisoners BURST INTO CHEERS. O'Connell looks up

at Evelyn. She smiles broadly and waves down at him.

CURATOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

CANDLE LIGHT FLICKERS across the Curator's face.

Standing in the shadows across from his desk are THREE MUMIA:

blue tinted skin, hideous facial tattoos, -- the works. One

of the Mumia has a rusty metal HOOK for a hand. He shrugs.

The Curator leans across his desk, fear in his eyes.

Spooks the hell out of the Mumia guys.

EXT. GIZA PORT - DAY

SMASH CUT TO: our old traitorous friend BENI.

WE CRANE BACK: to reveal Beni standing on the bow of a

PASSENGER BARGE. Surrounded by DANIELS, HENDERSON and BURNS.

WE KEEP CRANING BACK: as Henderson slaps Daniels on the back.

Now we see all of GIZA PORT: Team of explorers swarm the

docks. Across the Nile, the PYRAMIDS spike the sky. Evelyn

and Jonathan walk along the boardwalk besieged by HAWKERS

selling everything from toy tombs to King Tut action figures.

They both turn. O'Connell walks up; shaved, showered, spit

and polished, with a new haircut and clothes. He looks more

dashing and handsome than ever. Evelyn is suitably impressed.

Jonathan grabs O'Connell's arm and shakes his hand.

O'Connell quickly checks his pockets.

He finds his wallet and relaxes. DIRECTLY ABOVE HIM: on the

bow of the barge, Burns wipes his bifocals and turns to Beni.

And that's when Beni spots O'Connell. Beni shakes his head,

as if seeing a mirage, then starts backing away from the

men.

Beni quickly scurries off, vanishing down into the hold.

BACK DOWN WITH: Evelyn, recovering, she clears her throat.

O'Connell steps up close to Evelyn, invading her space looks

her straight in the eye. Evelyn doesn't back away.

O'Connell takes her bags and heads up the gangplank and onto

the same passenger barge that Beni and the Americans are on.

Evelyn's eyes follow him, a bit wistfully. Jonathan sees it.

Evelyn gives him a look. Jonathan just grins. And that's

when the warden suddenly brushes past, tipping his raggedy

hat.

And up the plank he goes. Evelyn and Jonathan share a look.

WE GO WIDE AGAIN: as the barge pulls out and heads down the

Nile. WE TILT UP: to the SUN, which then DISSOLVES into --

EXT. RIVER NILE - NIGHT

The MOON, shining down on the desert. The THREE VICIOUS MUMIA

quietly glide a narrow skiff out onto the river. The one

with the hook sits in the middle of the skiff, the other two

row, heading for the PASSENGER BARGE coming their way.

EXT. THE BAR AT THE BOW - NIGHT

Jonathan and the three Americans are playing poker. O'Connell

comes out a door carrying a GUNNY-SACK.

O'Connell returns Daniel's cocky look.

Burns slips on his dirty bifocals.

Henderson spits a wad of chew into a spittoon.

O'Connell's poker face drops, perplexed. Same with Jonathan.

O'Connell 'accidentally' hits him in the ribs with the

gunnysack, shutting him up. Jonathan quickly covers.

EXT. BARGE - NIGHT

Evelyn sits on a table, staring out over the passing river.

The gunny-sack DROPS onto the table, startling her.

O'Connell reaches into the gunny-sack and starts pulling out

revolvers, pistols, hunting knives, a massive elephant gun,

and a half dozen carefully wrapped sticks of dynamite.

This takes the smile off Evelyn's face. O'Connell starts

dismantling and cleaning the guns.

O'Connell looks into Evelyn's eyes.

She gives him a know-it-all grin.

Evelyn is surprised by his knowledge.

Evelyn gets up to go, then she hesitates, nervous, she turns

back to O'Connell, and as matter-of-fact as possible says:

O'Connell, cleaning his guns, just shrugs his shoulders.

Evelyn's eyes widen, furious, she turns and storms off.

O'Connell looks up, watching her leave, a bit perplexed.

Then he hears someone SNICKERING under the table. He quickly

reaches down, grabs that someone and lifts him up. It's Beni.

O'Connell sticks a knife under Beni's throat. Beni swallows

hard, then tries to weasel his way out with a big grin.

O'Connell pulls the knife away. Beni relaxes, rubs his neck.

They look as they hear Evelyn YELP. A single CAMEL in the

HORSE PADDOCK takes another bite at her. She YELPS again and

backs away. O'Connell grins as Evelyn flees down the deck.

O'Connell's eyes narrow at the insult, he looks back at Beni.

O'Connell grabs him and chucks him over the side of the barge.

Beni SPLASHES into the river. O'Connell takes his gunny-sack

and starts walking off down the deck.

And that's when he spots THREE SETS OF WET FOOTPRINTS, coming

up over the railing from the river and heading down the deck.

O'Connell quickly looks around, immediately on the alert.

INT. EVELYN'S CABIN - NIGHT

Evelyn, wearing a nightgown, stands in front of a mirror.

She gives her head a good shake, letting her hair fall loose

over her bare shoulders. Then she turns around, RIGHT THERE

IS ONE OF THE HIDEOUS MUMIA! It's Hook. He slams his hand

over her mouth and lifts up his hook, ready to strike.

Evelyn's terrified eyes glance down. Hook looks over, sees

the map lying next to a flickering candle on a nearby table.

Evelyn's eyes look confused. She shakes her head. Hook grins.

He cocks his hook, about to kill her. And that's when the

door is KICKED OPEN. O'Connell BURSTS IN, gun in each hand.

Hook spins Evelyn around and holds her out in front of him.

O'Connell looks at her.

Evelyn's eyes widen. And that's when the candle on the table

FLICKERS. Everything happens at once, READ FAST: O'Connell

spins around just as a window BURSTS OPEN. A Mumia leans in.

FIRES A GUN. Woodchips BLAST OFF the wall next to O'Connell's

head. He returns FIRE. Kills the Mumia. The Mumia falls back.

FIRING BLINDLY. A LANTERN in the room is BLASTED. Kerosene

SPLASHES across the wall. BURSTS INTO FLAMES. Evelyn grabs

the candle on the table and JAMS IT back over her shoulder,

right into Hook's EYE. He SCREECHES in pain and lets her go.

O'Connell grabs her and YANKS her out of the FLAMING ROOM.

HALLWAY - NIGHT

O'Connell pulls Evelyn down the hall, she tries to jerk free.

He shoves her up against a wall.

O'Connell gives her a look, then pulls her forward.

EVELYN'S FLAMING ROOM - NIGHT

Hot melted wax covers Hook's face as he holds his sore eye

and struggles to the door. Then he notices the key/box on

the floor. He bends over to pick it up. And that's when the

door is KICKED OPEN again, it hits him in the ass and knocks

him into the fire. Jonathan leans in. Sees nothing but flames.

Then he sees the key/box on the floor and picks it up. A

HAND suddenly snatches the key/box away from him.

It's Hook. His backside is now ON FIRE. He lifts his pistol.

Jonathan quickly backpedals out the door as Hook OPENS FIRE.

EXT. CAMEL PADDOCK - NIGHT

O'Connell and Evelyn race out onto the deck near the horse

paddock. People are SCREAMING and SHOUTING, lots of panic.

BLAM! A chunk of the wall is BLOWN OFF next to Evelyn's head.

O'Connell pivots and FIRES BACK. It's the last Mumia, on the

other side of the paddock. He and O'Connell exchange GUNFIRE.

Another LANTERN BURSTS INTO FLAMES. O'Connell SHOOTS OFF the

paddock lock. The horses go nuts. O'Connell FIRES over their

heads. They CHARGE FORWARD and CRASH through the door. The

Mumia SCREAMS as the horses STAMPEDE over him. FLAMES sweep

up the walls and race across the roof. Half the barge is now

ON FIRE. O'Connell throws the gunny-sack over his shoulder.

He picks her up and throws her over the side.

Evelyn SPLASHES into the water. O'Connell dives in after

her.

EXT. BARGE BOW - NIGHT

Jonathan runs out onto the bow, sees the three Americans,

guns in every hand, fanning their pistols, SHOOTING everything

in sight. Jonathan just shakes his head.

Hook suddenly stumbles up behind him, -- now a FLAMING TORCH.

Jonathan turns around, Hook grabs him by the throat with his

FLAMING ARM and pins him to the cabin wall. Jonathan's eyes

widen as he sees a hook rising up inside the FLAMES about to

strike him. The Americans pivot and OPEN FIRE. Blows Hook

over the railing. Jonathan turns to the Americans and smiles.

Then he points his thumb at himself

He lifts up his other hand, -- he has the key/box back.

And that's when the horses STAMPEDE onto the bow. Jonathan

dives over one side, the three Americans dive over the other.

NILE RIVERBANK - NIGHT

O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and the Warden wade out of the

water. Evelyn's nightgown clings tight to her body as she

wrings it out. She looks good. O'Connell notices.

Everybody else, including the horses, is getting out on the

far shore O'Connell spots Beni running up to the Americans.

Beni looks up at the stars, then angrily KICKS the sand

CURSING. The FLAMING barge drifts off, slowly sinking...

BEDOUIN TRADING POST - DAY

O'Connell barters in ARABIC with a CAMEL TRADER at a trading

post. Jonathan forks over some cash. The Trader hands them

the reins of four ugly old camels.

And that's when Evelyn steps out of a trading tent. She's

changed into a gorgeous, tightly fitted, Bedouin dress.

SAHARA DESERT SAND DUNES - DAY

O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and the warden are on camels in

the middle of the frying pan; the endless, sunbaked Sahara.

The warden savagely attacks a chicken wing with his vile

green teeth. Flies buzz around his head. He sucks at his

gums, then spits out some gristle. O'Connell watches him.

Evelyn is having the time of her life on top of her camel.

WE DO SEVERAL TIME DISSOLVES: showing the majesty of the

desert, and our heroes getting deeper and deeper into it.

FRYING PAN - NIGHT

The MOON shines down an four lone camel rider's trekking

across the vast wasteland.

Jonathan is sound asleep, his head bobbing comically to the

rhythm of his camel. On the camel next to him, the Warden

SNORES LOUDLY. Up in front of them, Evelyn slowly starts to

slide off her saddle. O'Connell reaches over and stops her,

then gently pushes her back up onto her saddle, never waking

her. For a long moment, his eyes watch Evelyn, and then he

looks up at a distant ridge --

-- where Ardeth Ray and a group of MUMIA RIDERS are pacing

them.

EXT. GIANT SAND DUNE - ENDLESS HORIZON - DAY

The dawning sun hasn't yet crested the distant horizon as

Jonathan and the Warden ride alongside a giant sand dune.

Up in front of them, O'Connell looks at Evelyn.

O'Connell looks down at the ground.

The others look down and see DOZENS OF SKELETONS sticking

out of the ground. Bleached and eaten away. Some of the

skeletons look like they're trying to crawl up out of the

desert floor.

The Warden shivers in fear.

The American Expedition rides out from behind the far end of

the dune. The Americans are accompanied by TWO DOZEN NATIVE

DIGGERS and an Arab EGYPTOLOGIST. Beni rides lead on a camel,

the rest ride horses.

O'Connell just nods. The two parties come to a stop a hundred

feet apart. O'Connell turns and stares out across the endless

horizon. Beni does likewise. The Americans look puzzled.

Henderson looks over at O'Connell.

O'Connell and Beni just stare out at the flat nothingness.

Evelyn and Jonathan share a look. And then, the SUN starts

to rise in the distance, breaking the flat horizon.

Evelyn can feel the suspense and the majesty of the moment.

Far off to the right, a HUGE SHAPE begins to rise with the

sun. A VOLCANO. O'Connell and Beni watch it, expressionless.

Daniels, Henderson and Burns share a look, and then --

The Americans take off. Racing towards the rising volcano.

Evelyn and Jonathan give O'Connell anxious, sarcastic looks.

O'Connell doesn't say a word, staring hard. Beni watches the

Americans and spits into the sand.

And then suddenly, the volcano SHIFTS ACROSS THE HORIZON.

Passing across the sun as it goes. It's a MIRAGE.

The Americans crash their horses to a stop and race the other

way, after the volcano. Evelyn and Jonathan smile, amazed.

The volcano SHIFTS AGAIN, floating across the watery horizon.

The Americans crash to a stop again and chase after the

volcano. All three of them confused and CURSING. O'Connell

and Beni just stare, waiting. The volcano SHIFTS AGAIN. And

the Americans crash to a stop again. Burns is THROWN from

his horse. Henderson angrily rips his hat off and chucks it

to the ground. Daniels just curses as they give up the chase.

The volcano comes to a stop on the far left of the horizon.

The Americans are on the far right. Nothing moves. A BEAT.

And then O'Connell grins. So does Beni. They share a look.

And then SWAT their camels and RACE AWAY. Everybody else

hauls-ass after them. O'Connell and Beni are neck-and-neck.

And then Evelyn comes galloping up, hair flying in the wind.

Beni takes out his camel whip and starts WHIPPING O'Connell.

Trying to knock him off his camel. once. CRACK! Twice. CRACK!

But on the third try O'Connell grabs the whip and JERKS Beni

off his camel. Beni SLAMS to the ground and TUMBLES.

Evelyn and O'Connell race across the desert. Evelyn has never

felt so alive. She LAUGHS. O'Connell grins; he likes this

girl. Beni stumbles to his feet, then quickly dances out of

the way as Jonathan and all the other riders stampede past

him. Evelyn beats O'Connell to the stone ramp, racing hard.

Evelyn ignores him as she races up the ramp towards the gate.

INT. HAMUNAPTRA - DAY

Evelyn goes ass-over-teacups through the air and crash lands

in a sand dune. She sits up, stunned, sandy hair in her eyes.

O'Connell stops at the edge of the ramp next to her camel.

The Americans ride up and look in wonder at the ruins inside

the volcano. O'Connell gives them a big, shit-eating grin.

EXT. HAMUNAPTRA - DAY

Under the guidance of the Egyptologist, the Diggers are busy

hauling rock and dirt out of the Temple doorway. The three

Americans are playing poker. Beni smokes a hookah and swats

flies. Dozens of stray CAMELS roam the decrepit city; dusty

backpacks and old saddlebags still slung over their humps.

EXT. OUR HEROES DIG - DAY

O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and the Warden are working next

to a narrow CREVICE, which weaves it's way through the ruins.

O'Connell ties a rope around a pillar and throws the rest of

the coils into the crevice, about to rappel down. Jonathan

bends over to have a look, his ass hits something, he YELPS

and backs away. It's the decrepit FACE OF ANUBIS.

Evelyn is positioning ancient MIRRORS along the crevice.

O'Connell shrugs, then rappels down into the crevice.

INT. EMBALMER'S CHAMBER - DAY

O'Connell waves a TORCH as Jonathan, Evelyn and the warden

drop down next to him. Evelyn peers into the spooky darkness.

Evelyn just rolls her eyes.

Jonathan sniffs the foul air, then he looks at the warden

and realizes where the smell is coming from. He stops

sniffing.

Evelyn brushes COBWEBS away from a METAL DISK on the wall,

then repositions it on it's pedestal, aiming it at a RAY OF

LIGHT shining in from the outer mirrors. -- THE RAY OF LIGHT

HITS THE DISK AND QUICKLY SHOOTS AROUND THE ROOM FROM ONE

DISK TO ANOTHER UNTIL THE WHOLE CHAMBER IS LIT UP. LIGHT

RAYS SHOOT OFF DOWN THE PASSAGEWAYS. It's the embalmer's

chamber.

O'Connell quickly draws his gun. Jonathan gently nudges him.

Evelyn heads down a narrow passageway. The others follow.

INT. LABYRINTH - DAY

O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan crouch as they make their way

through a narrow, COBWEB INFESTED LABYRINTH. The short, squat

warden can stand straight up. Then they hear something and

freeze. It sounds like somebody is clawing inside the walls.

They share looks. Then slowly move forward. Getting darker

and darker as they go. The strange sound getting louder and

louder. And then it stops. Evelyn holds her breath. Jonathan

licks his lips. O'Connell cocks his pistol. The warden FARTS.

O'Connell, Jonathan and Evelyn glare at him.

ANUBIS' CHAMBER - DAY

They slowly creep out of the labyrinth and up to the foot of

an enormous half-buried statue. The lower half of Anubis.

Then they hear the sound again, coming closer now, from the

other side of the statue. And closer. O'Connell pulls Evelyn

behind him. And closer. O'Connell raises his gun. And CLOSER!

O'Connell LEAPS OUT. -- THREE HORRIBLE SWEATY FACES LUNGE AT

HIM. O'Connell REACTS. But doesn't pull the trigger because

it's just the Americans, their guns are up, cocked and aimed.

But nobody lowers their guns. Daniels grins, the tough one.

And that's when Beni, five Diggers and the Egyptologist step

out of the shadows, -- all holding guns aimed at O'Connell.

Jonathan clenches a tiny derringer.

O'Connell gives him a sideways glance. Beni cocks his gun,

grinning, he wants it to happen. The tension thickens. Then

Evelyn gently takes O'Connell's gun hand and pulls it down.

Evelyn pulls O'Connell away. Jonathan and the Warden follow.

Beni and the Americans slowly lower their guns, laughing.

The Egyptologist excitedly begins translating the hieroglyphs.

INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY

O'Connell and Jonathan are using sledge-hammers against the

ceiling. Evelyn is gently chipping away with a tiny chisel.

Jonathan looks around.

INT. SCARAB CHAMBER - DAY

The Warden crawls into a DARK CHAMBER and LIGHTS A TORCH.

A mural wall comes alive. Embedded into it are dozens of

black amethyst SCARABS; glittering images of the sacred

beetles. Awestruck, the Warden pulls out a pocket knife and

starts prying away at one of the precious bugs.

INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER - DAY

Beni and the Americans hover around the Egyptologist, who's

found the SECRET COMPARTMENT inside Anubis. The Egyptologist

brushes sand away from the seam. Henderson steps forward and

grabs the seam, -- the Egyptologist quickly stops him.

Henderson sees the intense look in the Egyptologist's eyes

He looks back at the native Diggers.

The Egyptologist nods, then YELLS IN EGYPTIAN at the Diggers.

The Diggers hesitate, filled with fear. Daniels pulls out

his gun, aims it at three of the Diggers. The three Diggers

hesitantly step forward with crowbars and stick them into

the seams. The other Diggers back away, scared shitless.

Beni and the Americans exchange looks, and then they back

away as well.

INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY

Three Heroes are still digging into the ceiling

And that's when a huge chunk of the roof suddenly GIVES OUT.

O'Connell GRABS Evelyn and JERKS her clear. Jonathan DIVES

for the far wall. A MASSIVE STONE CASEMENT DROPS OUT OF THE

CEILING AND CRASHES to the floor. DUST FLIES. Fills the room.

INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER

Having heard the crash, Beni and the Americans have their

guns pointed at the floor. The Egyptologist could care less,

he looks at the Diggers, gripping their crowbars, and YELLS --

The three Diggers PULL HARD. The ancient seams start to give,

The Egyptologist YELLS again. The Diggers PULL HARDER. The

compartment starts to loosen. Again he YELLS. The Diggers

give one final pull and --

-- AN INTENSE BURST OF LIQUID SPRAYS OUT OF THE SEAM. HITS

THE THREE DIGGERS. MELTS THEIR SKIN CLEAN OFF. They SCREAM.

Dying horribly. HALF SKELETAL by the time they hit the

ground...

INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY

The dust is starting to clear. O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan

slowly get up and step over to the massive stone casement.

We immediately recognize it as IMHOTEP'S SARCOPHAGUS.

INT. SCARAB CHAMBER - DAY

The warden drops an amethyst-scarab into his pouch, then

greedily starts prying away at another. It rips off, he drops

it into his pouch, -- only he misses, and this scarab quietly

falls to the sandy floor without the Warden noticing.

CLOSE ON: the scarab on the floor. It begins to TRANSFORM.

The amethyst starts to glow. Something inside starts to

WIGGLE; as if the amethyst were some sort of strange cocoon.

Then it splits open and a real live hideous SCARAB BEETLE

scurries out. It races over to the warden's shoe, quickly

burrows into the leather and vanishes inside.

The Warden's eyes FLY OPEN. He starts to SCREAM, drops his

knife and frantically starts clawing away at his pant leg,

higher and higher until he rips open his shirt revealing a

large, hideous LUMP, BURROWING UNDER HIS SKIN. IT BURROWS

IT'S WAY UP HIS FAT BELLY AND ACROSS HIS HAIRY CHEST. The

Warden claws and scratches at it, trying to stop it. The

lump BURROWS UP HIS NECK. The Warden starts GAGGING and

COUGHING.

And then the scarab-lump VANISHES INTO HIS HEAD.

INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY

Our Heroes clear the dirt off the top of the sarcophagus,

revealing a single, ominous hieroglyph. Evelyn stares at it

Jonathan impatiently strums his fingers across the lid.

Evelyn stares at the hieroglyph, confused and concerned.

O'Connell dusts off the huge LOCK

Evelyn starts rummaging through the pack on Jonathan's back.

Evelyn pulls out the key/box. Jonathan tries to take it back.

Evelyn slaps his hand and quickly unfolds the box, -- it's

now shaped exactly like the LOCK'S KEYHOLE. Evelyn smiles.

And that's when they hear the Warden's SCREAMS echoing through

the labyrinth. All three of them turn and take-off running.

INT. LABYRINTH - DAY

The Warden is SCREAMING and dancing insanely around the

labyrinth, totally freaked from the extreme pain in his head.

O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan run up just as the Warden

starts RIPPING his own hair out of his head. O'Connell and

Jonathan grab at the Warden's hands, but he's far too crazed,

he shoves them aside, runs full bore down the length of the

labyrinth and SLAMS his head straight into a rock wall. The

Warden drops to the ground. Dead as lead. Eyes wide open.

O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan just stand there staring,

breathing hard, wide-eyed themselves...

EXT. BASE CAMP - NIGHT

Evelyn and Jonathan are nuzzled up to a campfire.

O'Connell comes up over some rocks.

A GUST OF WIND blows through the camp.

The campfire FLICKERS O'Connell and Jonathan share a nervous

look. Evelyn laughs.

O'Connell cocks his rifle, KA-CHANK! Gives her a big grin.

Jonathan opens the Warden's POUCH, the one that held the

scarabs. He reaches in, starts scrounging around. WE SLOWLY

PUSH IN. Waiting for the attack. THE MUSIC BUILDS. And then, --

Jonathan SCREAMS in pain and RIPS his hand back out of the

pouch. O'Connell and Evelyn both jump.

Jonathan sucks his finger, then reaches back into the pouch

and pulls out a LIQUOR BOTTLE, the top has been chipped off.

Jonathan smiles at the bottle, then turns the pouch inside

out and shakes it, nothing but SAND is inside it.

Jonathan takes a swig. O'Connell and Evelyn laugh, guiltily

And then O'Connell suddenly kneels down and sticks his ear

to the sand. Evelyn and Jonathan watch him. A BEAT. And then

a BARAGE OF GUNFIRE IS HEARD coming from the American camp.

O'Connell jumps up and throws the elephant gun to Evelyn.

He takes off running through the ruins. Evelyn immediately

gets up and runs after him. Jonathan grabs a gun, holds the

bottle of Seagrams; tight and dashes after her.

EXT. AMERICAN CAMP - NIGHT

The American camp is under siege. Two dozen MUMIA RIDERS

gallop through. FIRING RIFLES. Several Diggers are killed as

they run. The Americans leap out of their tents FIRING. Kill

multiple Riders. Daniels is shot, spins and falls, keeps

SHOOTING. Henderson and Burns run to his aid, BLASTING AWAY.

O'Connell races through the ruins and SLAMS right into Beni,

who is obviously trying to high-tail-it out of there.

O'Connell drags him back towards the American camp.

Ardeth Ray gallops through the camp, cutting Diggers down

with his scimitar. O'Connell runs up on top of some rocks,

LEAPS OUT and TACKLES him off his horse. The two men SLAM to

the ground. O'Connell spins up onto one knee and FIRES, point

blank. Blows the scimitar out of Ardeth Ray's hand. O'Connell

is about to shoot again when a horse rides up between them.

A scimitar swoops down, almost takes O'Connell's head off,

misses him by an inch. O'Connell leaps up and blows the Rider

off his mount. The horse BOLTS. -- But Ardeth Ray is gone.

Evelyn hides behind some rocks, watching the scene, suddenly,

she hears something coming up behind her and spins around.

A vicious tattooed Mumia Rider races at her. Evelyn quickly

backpedals over the rocks, terrified. The Mumia Rider raises

his scimitar, about to strike.

Evelyn SCREAMS, trips over a rock and FIRES the elephant

gun, -- BLAM! Blows the Rider off his mount and CATAPULTS

him twenty feet back into some ruins.

At the same time, the kick blows Evelyn off her feet and

over a ridge. She FLAILS through the air and lands in a sand

dune.

Jonathan and some Diggers are holding their own near the

temple door. Four Riders come CHARGING right at them.

Jonathan takes a swig off the Seagrams.

Jonathan and the Diggers OPEN FIRE. When the smoke clears,

the Riders are either dead or gone. Jonathan grins.

And then several more Mumia leap off the temple and land

behind them. Jonathan and the remaining Diggers spin around

and suddenly find themselves in hand-to-hand combat.

O'Connell is quickly loading his pistol. He hears something

THUNDERING UP behind him. He spins around just as Ardeth Ray

on a horse swings his scimitar. O'Connell instinctively raises

his hands to protect his face, the scimitar STRIKES!

Hits his gun, -- CHING! O'Connell's gun flips away. Disarmed,

O'Connell dives and rolls and suddenly comes up with a stick

of dynamite in his hand. He shoves the fuse into a fire. It

IGNITES. He faces Ardeth Ray, towering above him. The two

men lock eyes. The fuse continues to burn down. Ardeth Ray

points his scimitar at O'Connell's head.

Ardeth Ray GALLOPS OFF. The remaining Mumia Riders race after

him, vanishing into the night. O'Connell watches them leave,

then turns to the burning fuse,... and blows it out. Evelyn

staggers up, looking very shaken. O'Connell gently takes her

and holds her close.

Evelyn looks up into his strong eyes. It's the first time

he's shown genuine concern for her. And she likes it. He's

also holding her a little too close. And she likes that too.

Beni crawls out from under some pillars as Henderson and

Burns help Daniels to his feet.

O'Connell looks up into the surrounding ridges, unsatisfied.

Evelyn looks at O'Connell, suddenly very worried.

EXT. BASE CAMP - NIGHT

Jonathan falls into FRAME. Hits the ground. Eyes wide open.

Mouth agape. Clearly dead. A BEAT. And then his eyes close

and his mouth widens into a goofy smile. Shit-faced drunk.

O'Connell and Evelyn laugh, both half-in-the-bag themselves,

the bottle of Seagrams is almost gone. O'Connell offers the

bottle to Evelyn, she waves it away, slurring badly --

O'Connell polishes off the bottle and chucks it away.

Evelyn is insulted, she staggers to her feet.

Evelyn plops back down beside him, really drunk, she grins

and proudly lifts her head high.

She leans in, very close to his face, looks him in the eyes,

She gives him a goofy smile. He leans forward and KISSES

HER. Evelyn's eyes slowly close. And then she passes out,

slumping into his arms. O'Connell looks down at her, and

just smiles.

INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY

Evelyn's HAND slips the KEY into the sarcophagus, lock and

turns it. A series of STRANGE MECHANICAL-LIKE SOUNDS are

heard, and then the sarcophagus unlocks with a GIANT HISS.

O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan all look very, very hungover.

They start to slide the heavy lid off the sarcophagus.

PUSHING, SHOVING and GROANING, the lid budging, inch by inch.

O'Connell gives her a hurt look.

Evelyn gives O'Connell a nervous look.

O'Connell gives her a big cheesy smile. Evelyn's face drops,

appalled and embarrassed. And that's when the lid FALLS OFF

and LOUDLY CRASHES to the ground. All three of them instantly

grab their sore heads and MOAN.

INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER - DAY

Several fear-filled, sweaty-faced Diggers reach into the

secret compartment. Henderson and Burns hold guns on them.

Daniels has his arm in a sling. The Diggers slowly pull out

the ORNATE CHEST. They set the chest down on the sandy floor.

Beni watches as the Egyptologist translates the hieratics.

The Egyptologist gives them the evil-eye

The Egyptologist slowly and carefully reads the inscription:

A GUST OF WIND blows through the chamber. TORCHES FLICKER

All the Diggers suddenly turn tail and run off SCREAMING.

The Americans look at each other, suddenly very nervous.

The three Americans laugh.

The WIND WHISTLES. Torches FLICKER. VERY SPOOKY. Beni and

the Egyptologist share a fear-filled look. Henderson just

shrugs.

INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY

WHAM! Imhotep's wooden coffin is DROPPED to the ground next

to his stone sarcophagus. Evelyn is very excited.

Evelyn just gives him a look, then starts brushing dirt and

cobwebs off the top of the coffin. Then she freezes.

O'Connell and Jonathan are too excited to care.

Evelyn can't believe these guys. Jonathan inserts the key/box

into the coffin's lock. Turns it. The lid cracks open with a

HISS. They all react to the FOUL STENCH. Then O'Connell grabs

the lid. It's stuck. He pulls with all his might. Jonathan

helps him. It starts to give way. Slowly. Slowly. Slooooowly.

And then it suddenly POPS OPEN and THE MOST HIDEOUS, MAGGOT

INFESTED, ROTTEN CORPSE IMAGINABLE JUMPS UP!

They all jump back. Scared to death. Imhotep is now the

'Elephant Man' of corpses; twisted and deformed. The years

have not been kind. He slumps back into his coffin.

INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER - DAY

Henderson and Daniels start to pry at the lid of the wooden

chest. Beni and the Egyptologist watch. In the background,

Beni starts backing away, filled with fear, sweating buckets.

Beni turns and bolts from the chamber. Daniels spits.

And that's when the seal breaks, -- A BLACK VAPOR BLASTS OUT

OF THE CHEST. Everybody vanishes into the strange cloud.

INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - DAY

O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan slowly creep forward and

carefully look back inside Imhotep's coffin, creeped-out.

O'Connell points at the inside of the COFFIN LID, where there

are FINGERNAIL SCRATCHES and DRIED BLOOD all over the inside.

This sends a chill through everyone. Evelyn leans in closer.

WE PUSH IN on a grouping of hieratics WRITTEN IN BLOOD.

Jonathan shivers. O'Connell looks around.

INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER - DAY

The vapor is settling. The Americans have their guns aimed

at the chest. The Egyptologist slowly steps up, reaches

inside, and lifts out a heavy burlap bag. Everyone's eyes

widen in excitement as he sticks his hand into the bag and

slowly pulls out the black BOOK OF THE DEAD, the same book

Imhotep used in his attempt to bring Anck-su-namun back to

life.

Henderson kicks the sandy floor in anger.

Daniels kicks the chest. It breaks open, unfolding to reveal

a lower compartment. Inside, are Anck-su-namun's FIVE JEWEL

ENCRUSTED CANOPIC JARS (one is shattered and without jewels)

EXT. BASE CAMP - NIGHT

The two camps have now joined together. O'Connell and Beni

are roasting chunks of hairy meat over a fire. Jonathan

wrinkles his nose, disgusted by the smell.

O'Connell and Beni both grin. Jonathan looks horrified.

The gloating Americans sit down, fondling their jeweled jars.

The Americans laugh. Evelyn walks up, sits down and drops a

pile of big dusty BUG SKELETONS onto the ground.

She shrugs, then looks at the roasting meat

O'Connell and Jonathan stare at the bug skeletons, disgusted.

All the men share nervous looks, really spooked. Evelyn just

laughs at them, then pulls a meat stick out of the fire.

EXT. CAMP - LATER THAT NIGHT

Having just freshened up for bed, Evelyn exits the temple

and steps past the sleeping Diggers. She spots the

Egyptologist, his jeweled canopic jar snug under one arm,

the Book Of The Dead laying loose under the other. Evelyn

stares at the Book, nervously biting her lip, then she sneaks

over, carefully steals it, and quickly tip-toes away.

Lying on some blankets by the campfire, O'Connell rolls over

and sees Evelyn, sitting wide-eyed, staring at the Book.

Evelyn opens the cover. THE FIRE FLICKERS. She and O'Connell

share a nervous look, then Evelyn shrugs and starts reading.

Evelyn continues READING THE BOOK ALOUD IN ANCIENT EGYPTIAN.

INT. IMHOTEP'S CHAMBER - NIGHT

Evelyn's VOICE is OVERLAID as WE START WIDE on Imhotep's

chamber and SLOWLY PUSH IN on his sarcophagus. WE PUSH IN

over the lip of the coffin, then closer and closer towards

Imhotep's rotten, twisted head, until his putrid face fills

FRAME, -- and then suddenly his crusty eyelids Pop OPEN!

Revealing EMPTY SOCKETS. -- BIG SCARY MUSIC STING.

EXT. BASE CAMP - NIGHT

The Egyptologist sits bolt upright. Quickly looks around,

sees Evelyn reading the Book. He gets up and runs for her.

He skids to a stop as a strange, piercing WHINE is heard,

coming from out in the desert. O'Connell and the others all

leap to their feet. The Americans run out of their tents.

The SOUND gets LOUDER and CLOSER. And then from out of the

darkness a HUGE WALL OF LOCUSTS SWIRLS into camp and envelops

everyone. O'Connell grabs Evelyn, and with Jonathan at their

side they race for the crevice, trying to fend off the horrid

vermin as they go. Beni and the Americans run for the temple.

The Egyptologist is covered in locusts. He stares at The

Book Of The Dead, looking haunted.

The campfire is SUCKED UP INTO THE AIR

INT. LABYRINTH CORRIDOR - NIGHT

O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan race down the labyrinth,

slapping at themselves and picking locusts out of their hair

Evelyn steps forward, something SQUISHES. O'Connell lowers

his TORCH, -- the entire floor is FILLED WITH SLIMY FROGS.

INT. LABYRINTH PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

The Americans, Beni and the Diggers race into a passageway.

Burns is knocked down, his bifocals skitter across the ground,

they get CRUSHED in the stampede. Burns staggers to his feet,

squinting. BLURRY FIGURES vanish into the darkness,

INT. LABYRINTH CORRIDOR - NIGHT

The ground under O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan starts to

SHAKE. Then suddenly, right in front of them, -- HUNDREDS OF

CHITTERING SCARAB BEETLES BOIL UP OUT OF THE SAND. Start

scurrying towards them. Evelyn SCREAMS. Jonathan SCREAMS.

Even O'Connell almost screams. They turn around and haul

ass.

INT. PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT

Burns staggers down a passageway, squinting, his hands out

in front of him, groping, trying not to bump into anything.

Then ten feet in front of him, a dark, blurry FIGURE steps

out.

Burns half-blindly staggers forward. The Figure doesn't move.

Burns TRIPS, stumbles forward, towards the Figure, his hands

reach out and SINK INTO IMHOTEP'S PUTRID CHEST CAVITY. Burns

jumps like a scalded cat, pulls his hands out and looks at

them, -- HIS HANDS ARE COVERED IN MOLTEN FLESH ROT. He starts

to SCREAM. A SKELETAL HAND clamps over his mouth.

LABYRINTH STAIRCASE - NIGHT

O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan race up the staircase, just

ahead of the mass of SCURRYING, CHITTERING SCARABS.

O'Connell leaps out onto a pedestal. Jonathan jumps up next

to him. Evelyn jumps up into a grotto on the other side of

the narrow stairway. The horrible herd of vicious scarabs

scurries between them, their ear-piercing CHITTERS send

shivers up Evelyn's spine. She leans back. THE WALL MOVES.

Evelyn falls backwards through an opening. O'Connell and

Jonathan watch the scarabs vanish up the staircase. Then

they look across the way. Evelyn is gone.

SCARAB CHAMBER - NIGHT

Evelyn sits up, shakes the sand out of her hair, fearfully

looks around. It's almost PITCH BLACK. She gets up and feels

her way along the dark walls. She rounds a corner. A shaft

of MOONLIGHT filters in through a crack in the ceiling. A

MAN stands in the middle of the room. Evelyn walks towards

him.

Just as she reaches him he turns around. It's Burns. BOTH OF

HIS EYES ARE MISSING. He stares at her with vacant sockets.

Evelyn SCREAMS in horror and backs away, hyperventilating,

she bumps into something. She SCREAMS again and spins around

It's Imhotep. With two fresh EYEBALLS in his sockets.

Evelyn SCREAMS again and backs away into a wall. Her hair is

down, her face is dirty and sweaty, her blouse is ripped,

her dress is torn, she's never looked sexier. Imhotep SQUINTS.

LABYRINTH STAIRCASE - NIGHT

O'Connell is feeling his way around inside the grotto

And then they heat MEN SCREAMING, and suddenly, Henderson,

Daniels and one of the Diggers come running down the stairs.

O'Connell and Jonathan join them as they hear the herd of

CHITTERING scarabs coming their way. The Digger suddenly

trips and falls. O'Connell slows down, about to go back and

help him. But it's too late. The Digger SCREAMS in horror as

the herd of scarabs run over him, eating straight through

him, leaving behind the Digger's half eaten skeleton. Daniels

Henderson and Jonathan react in horror. O'Connell's already

running, races right past them. The others turn and haul

ass.

SCARAB CHAMBER - NIGHT

Imhotep steps forward, -- the sand around him seems to

MAGNETIZE, swirling and dancing around his flaking skeletal

legs. Evelyn starts backing away, horrified, looks at Burns

Burns opens his mouth, but can only GURGLE and MOAN because

HIS TONGUE IS MISSING. Imhotep grabs him, throws him to the

ground and sets his skeletal foot on Burns' chest, like a

big game hunter standing on his kill. Imhotep then parts his

fetid lips, -- A FRESH TONGUE FLAPS BETWEEN HIS ROTTED TEETH.

Evelyn shivers in fear. Suddenly, O'Connell comes flying

around the corner and runs right up to her.

O'Connell sees the look in her eyes and turns around, -- at

the sight of Imhotep, O'Connell jumps back in fright.

O'Connell and Evelyn start backing away down the wall.

Imhotep glides sideways with them, like a tiger cornering

his prey, the sand around him SWIRLS and DANCES. Burns starts

to crawl away, whimpering as he goes. Imhotep suddenly stops

and UNHINGES his skeletal jaw, his skinless mouth stretches

to an inhuman size, and he lets out a horrific, primordial

SHRIEK.

Evelyn SCREAMS. O'Connell shudders, then, embarrassed by his

fear, he opens his own mouth and ROARS right back at him --

Then BLASTS him with the elephant gun, --BLAM! Through the

SMOKE AND FLAMMAGE we see Imhotep blown off his feet, his

ribcage half torn away. O'Connell grabs Evelyn and runs.

EXT. CREVICE - NIGHT

SAND and WIND whip through the ruins as O'Connell and Evelyn

stumble up out of the crevice and COME FACE-TO-FACE WITH TEN

ARMED MUMIA. The Mumia quickly raise their guns. O'Connell

and Evelyn quickly raise their hands. Jonathan, Henderson,

Daniels and the Egyptologist are already on their knees,

hands over their heads. Ardeth Ray steps forward.

INT. ANUBIS' CHAMBER - NIGHT

Beni slowly backs up around Anubis, eyes wide, gun up. He

turns around, -- IMHOTEP IS RIGHT THERE! Beni SCREAMS, backs

away and OPENS FIRE. Six GUNSHOTS perforate Imhotep, but

have no effect except to SPLATTER molten flesh rot onto the

back wall. Beni retreats into a corner, scared shitless.

Imhotep moves forward, his one hand trying to stop the molten

mummy guts from oozing out of the large shotgun hole in his

side. Beni drops his gun and grabs at the CHAINS around his

neck, RELIGIOUS SYMBOLS AND ICONS dangle from each chain.

Beni holds the first one up: A CHRISTIAN CRUCIFIX. He quickly

makes the sign of-the cross and blesses himself in English:

It has no effect on Imhotep, who continues forward. Beni

quickly grabs at the other symbols and icons, holding them

out towards Imhotep, one after the other, trying to slow his

progress: an Islamic Sword and Crescent Moon necklace; a

Hindu Brahma medallion; a small Buddhist Bodhisattva statue.

All while blessing himself in Arabic, Hindi, Chinese and

Latin. Nothing works. Imhotep's skeletal hand reaches for

Beni's throat. Tears run down Beni's cheeks he's so freaked.

And that's when he holds up THE STAR OF DAVID and blesses

himself in HEBREW. Imhotep stops in his tracks. His hand

lowers. His grotesque new eyeballs stare at Beni.

Looks at him quizzically. Imhotep takes a step back.

Imhotep reaches into his tattered robe, and then holds out

his fetid hand, filled with squirming MAGGOTS. Beni cringes,

about to throw up, but then the maggots part, -- revealing a

tiny pile of little JEWELS. Beni's eyes widen. Imhotep raises

his other hand, it holds Anck-su-namun's BROKEN CANOPIC JAR.

EXT. CREVICE - NIGHT

Several Mumia drag Burns up, he stares out with vacant

sockets. Daniels and Henderson are especially horrified.

Evelyn ELBOWS Jonathan in the ribs.

Ardeth Ray and the Mumia start heading down into the crevice.

O'Connell yells at them, trying to convince himself.

Ardeth Ray stops and looks back, deadly serious.

Ardeth Ray turns and jumps down into the crevice,

EXT. RUINS - NIGHT

O'Connell and Jonathan boost Evelyn up onto a camel. Daniels

and Henderson throw Burns up onto another. The Egyptologist,

still clutching The Book Of The Dead, gets up on yet another.

They all head off into the dark, windblown desert...

And then in the extreme foreground, A SKELETAL HAND SUDDENLY

PUNCHES UP OUT OF THE SAND, ACCOMPANIED BY THE MOST HORRIFIC,

PRIMORDIAL SHRIEK IMAGINABLE --

EXT. BRITISH FORT - CAIRO - DAY

A British flag flies over BRITISH SOLDIERS manning the front

gate. Our tired, disheveled Heroes saunter up on their dusty

camels. The Soldiers check their papers, then let them enter.

INT. EVELYN'S QUARTERS - DAY

A steamer trunk is slammed to the floor and thrown open.

O'Connell chucks a load of DRESSES into the trunk.

O'Connell heads for the closet. Evelyn UNPACKS the dresses

O'Connell throws a handful of her underthings into the trunk.

O'Connell continues to PACK Evelyn's clothes as she continues

to UNPACK them:

O'Connell angrily stretches a bra between his hands.

Evelyn grabs the bra and throws it into a drawer.

O'Connell stuffs a pile of Evelyn's shoes into the trunk.

Evelyn KICKS the lid shut, slamming it on his fingers.

O'Connell YELPS and angrily storms around the room sucking

his fingers as Evelyn follows him.

O'Connell storms out and SLAMS the door. A BEAT. Then the

door opens and O'Connell's hand reaches back in and throws a

handful of frilly panties to the floor. SLAM goes the door.

EXT. BRITISH FORT COMPOUND - DAY

O'Connell angrily strides through the compound. He sees Beni

coming up the path with a MAN dressed in hooded robes, his

face covered by an ornate death mask. Imhotep disguised.

O'Connell sticks out his hand, -- Imhotep instantly recoils

O'Connell gives him the once-over. Beni quickly covers.

O'Connell fake-punches him. Beni flinches. O'Connell gives

Imhotep a look as he strides off.

Imhotep's grotesque new eyes glare out from behind the mask.

INT. CASBAH - DAY

The proverbial den-of-iniquity. Hard men, hard women and

hard liquor. Lots of deals going down. An OLDER GUY with a

walrus mustache is drunk and talking to some tough customers.

He wears British WWI fighter pilot gear. Meet WINSTON HAVLOCK.

The tough customers shove him away. Winston staggers over to

O'Connell and Jonathan at the bar, not missing a beat.

O'Connell shoves him away. Winston staggers back to Jonathan.

Jonathan shoves him towards another group of unlucky sods

Henderson and Daniels sidle up to the bar next to them.

Burns, now tongue-less, talks with a severe impediment.

Imhotep opens the drawer and pulls out some bifocals. He

puts the bifocals on over his death mask, -- and grins

broadly, his rotted teeth showing through the mouth hole.

The expression on Burns' face starts to change, very puzzled.

A look of pure fear registers on Burns, face. Beni quickly

backs away and runs out of the room. Imhotep picks up the

sacred canopic jar, then removes the death mask, revealing

his hideous, shattered CORPSE-SKULL.

INT. CASBAH - DAY

Three shot glasses clink together. O'Connell, Jonathan and

Henderson slug 'em down, -- all three of them instantly SPIT

OUT the liquid. Half the bar SPITS OUT their drinks as well.

They all look at each other, even more nervous.

A look passes over O'Connell's face, a realization.

He suddenly jumps away from the bar and runs for the door.

EXT. BRITISH FORT COMPOUND - DAY

LIGHTNING FLASHES as O'Connell races across the compound,

knocking several Soldiers out of his way, panic stricken.

EXT. BRITISH FORT COURTYARD - DAY

Evelyn calmly steps into a courtyard carrying a handful of

books. A BLAST OF THUNDER AND LIGHTNING scares her. She drops

half the books. Then a HAND GRABS HER! She jumps again and

drops the rest of the books. It's O'Connell, breathing hard.

And that's when a barrage of HAIL AND FIRE slams into the

courtyard. O'Connell and Evelyn jump back. A water fountain

bursts into STEAM. A wooden trellis catches FIRE. O'Connell

and Evelyn run under the eaves as SOLDIERS, SERVANTS and

CAMELS run in every direction, trying to avoid the maelstrom.

O'Connell gives her an incredulous look and gestures at the

HAIL and FIRE.

The HAIL and FIRE come to a stop. Everything goes dead quiet.

O'Connell and Evelyn freeze. And then a BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM

is heard coming from the living quarters directly above them.

O'Connell and Evelyn race up the stairs.

INT. BURNS' QUARTERS - DAY

O'Connell and Evelyn race into the room, past the Servant

who is running out SCREAMING. They skid to a stop as they

spot Burns, or what's left of him, lying dead on the floor, --

HIS BODY IS SHRIVELED TO HALF IT'S SIZE.

Drained of all organs and liquids. O'Connell and Evelyn are

shocked. Then they hear a LOUD MOAN and notice Imhotep

standing on the far side of the room. O'Connell draws his

gun.

Imhotep is REGENERATING: A thick skin FORMS over powerful

new musculature. His tendons RIPPLE. His bones BULGE and

REFORM. His mouth opens to an inhuman size as he MOANS and

CRIES OUT, in severe pain. And then it's over. And he looks

like an incredibly muscular, corpse-like vision from hell.

The 'Terminator' Mummy. O'Connell and Evelyn are stunned.

Imhotep starts to move towards them, staring at Evelyn.

Imhotep keeps coming. O'Connell OPENS FIRE. BLASTING Imhotep

Bullets RIP through his body. Imhotep doesn't seem to mind.

Jonathan, Henderson and Daniels run into the room. They're

all stunned at the sight of Imhotep.

O'Connell steps forward, throws a RIGHT HOOK, punches Imhotep

in the face, -- HIS FIST GOES THROUGH IMHOTEP'S SKULL AND

GETS STUCK DEEP INSIDE HIS HEAD. O'Connell stares at it,

shocked, then quickly YANKS his fist back out. The area of

Imhotep's face that came into contact with O'Connell's fist

quickly DEGENERATES and DECAYS, right down to the bone, as

if O'Connell's hand instantly infected it.

Imhotep angrily turns, grabs O'Connell, and with no effort,

THROWS him across the room and into Jonathan and the others

knocking them down. Imhotep looks at his hand, the one that

just grabbed O'Connell, -- IT STARTS TO SHRIVEL and DECAY.

He quickly turns to Evelyn. Evelyn backs away into a wall,

terrorized. Imhotep steps up to her.

He leans in, about to kiss her with his decayed face.

And that's when a WHITE CAT jumps onto the piano, HISSING.

Imhotep SHRIEKS. The balcony doors BLOW OPEN. Imhotep spins

into a BLAST OF WIND AND SAND and SWIRLS out the doors. Gone.

O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and Daniels stand transfixed.

Henderson kneels next to Burns, shriveled body, horrified.

INT. MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITIES - DAY

O'Connell, Jonathan, Henderson and Daniels follow Evelyn

across the Ramesseum.

They round a corner and come upon the Curator, -- who is

talking with Ardeth Ray. Everybody stops.

O'Connell and the American's quickly draw their guns. Ardeth

Ray just scowls. The Curator nods his head.

Everybody tenses, guns up. Then O'Connell uncocks his .38.

He slides his gun back into his shoulder-holster.

INT. RAMESSEUM - MOMENTS LATER

Everyone is assembled around the tomb display of Seti The

First.

We recognize his chariot and sword. The Curator sits on Seti's

throne.

Daniels is totally wigged-out, he looks at O'Connell.

The Curator and Ardeth Ray look at Evelyn, thunderstruck.

Jonathan scratches his ear with the barrel of his pistol.

Ardeth Ray has been staring out a wall of windows.

Everyone follows Ardeth Ray's eyes, through the windows we

can see the SUN, -- which is now going into a FULL ECLIPSE.

EXT. BRITISH FORT - WINDOW - DAY FOR NIGHT

O'Connell looks out a window at the British Soldiers manning

the walls. Above and beyond them, -- is the BLACK SUN.

EXT. EVELYN'S FOYER - DAY FOR NIGHT

Evelyn and Jonathan are pacing the foyer

She turns to Daniels and Henderson.

O'Connell turns from the window.

O'Connell looks at Evelyn, Daniels and Henderson.

All three of them pounce on him at once --

O'Connell just shakes his head and SIGHS. Totally put-upon.

Then he takes Evelyn, shoves her into the bedroom, slams the

door and locks it with a skeleton key. From inside her room

we can hear Evelyn POUNDING on the door and YELLING.

O'Connell throws the skeleton key to Daniels.

Jonathan swallows hard and points to himself.

CAIRO ALLEYWAYS - BAZAAR - DAY FOR NIGHT

The Egyptologist stumbles through the dark alleys, looking

haunted. He clutches the Book of The Dead in one hand and

his SACRED CANOPIC JAR in the other. Imhotep is stalking

him. A STREET VENDOR turns and sees Imhotep's horribly decayed

face.

He reacts and scurries away. Imhotep lifts his robe, covers

his face, and moves in on the Egyptologist, who is heading

into the bazaar. WE PAN UP TO --

THE EGYPTOLOGIST'S OFFICE - DAY FOR NIGHT

Beni is RANSACKING the joint, pulling out drawers and files

and throwing them on the floor. He finds a silver pocket

watch, shakes it, then throws it into his pocket, then he

starts tipping over bookcases and clearing shelves.

Beni spins around. O'Connell and Jonathan stand in the door.

Beni turns and runs for an open window. O'Connell grabs a

chair, FLINGS IT into his path. Beni TRIPS and CRASHES into

a wall. O'Connell strides over, grabs him and lifts him up

the wall. Beni's feet dangle off the floor.

O'Connell quickly slides his knife up under Beni's chin.

O'Connell shoves the knife deeper into Beni's skin.

O'Connell looks at Jonathan. Beni seizes the moment and KNEES

O'Connell in the balls. O'Connell doubles over and collapses.

Beni leaps out the window. Jonathan cringes.

And that's when they hear a BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM coming

from down in the bazaar. O'Connell and Jonathan scramble to

the window and look out --

EXT. BAZAAR - DAY FOR NIGHT

Down in the bazaar, people are SCREAMING and quickly backing

away from the SHRIVELED CORPSE OF THE EGYPTOLOGIST.

A partially decayed HAND reaches down and takes the sacred

canopic jar out of the Egyptologist's shriveled hand. It's

Imhotep, having regenerated even further. He looks up and

catches eyes with O'Connell. Imhotep grins, then UNHINGES;

his jaw, his mouth stretches to an inhuman size, and then a

huge SWARM OF FLIES comes out of his mouth and races straight

up at O'Connell and Jonathan. They both SLAM the shutters.

The flies SLAM into the closed window and immediately spread

throughout the bazaar. Sending people SCREAMING and running.

EGYPTOLOGIST'S OFFICE - DAY FOR NIGHT

O'Connell and Jonathan look at each other, panicked.

They turn and race out of the office.

BRITISH FORT - WINDOW --NIGHT

Daniels stares out a window, watching the British Guards at

the front gate. More Soldiers march the encircling parapet.

The lights and MUSIC from the Casbah come up from below

INT. EVELYN'S FOYER - NIGHT

Daniels turns from the window. Henderson sits in a chair

next to Evelyn's door, chain smoking. Both look wired with

fear.

Daniels nods and heads out. Henderson just sits there, alone,

smoking. He reaches into his jacket pocket, pulls out his

SACRED CANOPIC JAR and fondles it. A BREEZE suddenly comes

in through the open window. The curtains flutter. Henderson

gets up and goes over to shut it. He looks out the window.

The CAMERA races over the compound, into the window and HITS

Henderson square in the FACE just as he's about to scream.

Henderson is lifted into the air by a mass of SWIRLING SAND.

His body TWISTS and TURNS and slowly SHRIVELS as the life is

SUCKED out of him.

Then he COLLAPSES to the floor. On the wall above him, the

SHADOW of the SWIRLING SAND condenses, forming a SHADOW of a

human body. The SHADOW CONVULSES as the body REGENERATES.

And then it's over.

Imhotep steps into view. He's regenerated even further and

looks almost normal now, his face no longer decayed. He steps

over Henderson's shriveled body and up to Evelyn's door,

rattles the knob. It's locked. Imhotep grins.

EVELYN'S ROOM - NIGHT

Evelyn is asleep in her bed as SAND begins streaming in

through the keyhole, pouring onto the floor, forming a large

mound. Evelyn starts to toss and turn. WE PAN BACK OVER TO

THE DOOR: The mound of sand is gone and in it's place is

Imhotep.

INT. FOYER - NIGHT

O'Connell and Jonathan race into the foyer and skid to a

stop as they see Henderson's shriveled body on the floor.

O'Connell runs up to Evelyn's door and rattles the knob,

still locked. He bends down and looks in through the KEYHOLE.

EVELYN'S ROOM - NIGHT

Imhotep leans down towards Evelyn, about to kiss her as she

sleeps. The door starts to CRASH and BANG from O'Connell.

Imhotep ignores it. And KISSES Evelyn. His lips and mouth

instantly start to DEGENERATE and DECAY. Right down to the

bone. The door BURSTS OPEN. Evelyn wakes up. Sees Imhotep's

rotted mouth kissing her. She SCREAMS and shoves him away.

Imhotep's putrid mouth grimaces in sadness.

Imhotep's sadness turns to anger as he spins around and faces

O'Connell. Imhotep licks his fetid lips. O'Connell smirks.

Imhotep starts to move for O'Connell.

He throws the white cat at Imhotep. Imhotep instinctively

catches it.

He SHRIEKS, drops the cat and stumbles back towards the

window, -- which suddenly BLOWS OPEN. Imhotep spins like a

dervish and BURSTS INTO A WHIRLWIND OF SAND.

Everybody covers their eyes. The Imhotep/sand-devil EXPLODES

out the window and vanishes over the compound.

Jonathan aims his gun at the window, his hand shaking badly.

O'Connell hugs Evelyn as she wipes her mouth in disgust.

Daniels walks in, looks at Henderson's shriveled body on the

floor... and drops the martini glasses.

INT. 1923 CONVERTIBLE DUSSENBERG - NIGHT

Jonathan races his big convertible through the streets,

HONKING constantly. Evelyn sits between him and O'Connell,

looking scared and nervous, then she gives O'Connell a look.

Daniels leans forward from the back seat, filled with fear,

They race into the driveway of the museum of Antiquities.

EXT. CAIRO BAZAAR - NIGHT

A FULL MOON now shines down on the bazaar, still bustling

with activity. Suddenly, a BREEZE kicks-in. GREEN MIST begins

to SWIRL down the street and through the stalls. The people

begin to CHOKE and COUGH and RETCH, as if being hit by a

severe sickness -- it's already too late.

Imhotep strolls through the sickened mob, his face half rotted

off, his deformed mouth grinning happily. Beni is at his

side, looking very nervous.

And then, one-by-one, the people silently begin to follow

Imhotep, their skin now covered in disgustingly hideous BOILS

AND SORES.

INT. MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITIES - NIGHT

O'Connell., Jonathan, Daniels, the Curator and Ardeth Ray

follow Evelyn as she strides through the museum.

The Curator joins Evelyn at her side as she heads up the

stairs, everyone else in hot pursuit.

They reach the display cases. Evelyn quickly opens them.

LOUD CHANTING is heard coming from outside. They all rush

over to the upper windows and look down -- OUTSIDE: A large,

CRAZED MOB covered in hideous boils and sores comes CHANTING

up the driveway: 'Anck-su-namun! Anck-su-namun!'

Evelyn dashes back to the display cases. Everyone follows.

EXT. MUSEUM - NIGHT

The crazed mob CRASHES into the huge front doors, which are

locked. They pound furiously, throwing themselves at it while

CHANTING CONSTANTLY. Imhotep solemnly comes up the driveway.

INT. MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITIES - UPPER BALCONY - NIGHT

The BANGING on the doors can be heard as Evelyn and the

Curator quickly sort through broken pieces of stone tablets.

The others watch. Evelyn pulls out a large piece.

The BANGING gets LOUDER. Multiple windows SHATTER. Evelyn

talks while quickly translating the tablet:

Evelyn finds the translation in the tablet and smiles.

TWO HIDEOUS BOIL & SORE-COVERED MEN charge out of a doorway,

SCREAMING. O'Connell and Ardeth Ray grab them and chuck them

over the railing. The men fly through the air and CRASH into

the lower display cases. The front doors suddenly BURST OPEN,

The crazed mob pours into the museum. our heroes haul ass

across the balcony and down the staircase.

EXT. MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITY - NIGHT

Jonathan sneaks out of some bushes and quickly heads for his

convertible. Suddenly, a splinter group of the diseased mob

comes around the side of the museum. Jonathan instantly bugs

his eyes out, starts drooling, and begins CHANTING --

The crazed group runs past him and heads into the front doors

of the museum. Jonathan leaps into the convertible, fires it

up and 180's it back over to the bushes.

O'Connell, Evelyn, Daniels, Ardeth Ray and the Curator jump

inside the car. Beni steps out of the museum and sees them.

Imhotep looks out of the museum from the shattered upper

windows just as the convertible PEELS OUT. O'Connell points

a finger at Beni as they race past him.

Imhotep UNHINGES his jaw, his mouth stretches to an inhuman

size, he lets out one of his horrific, primordial SHRIEKS.

His disease-ridden disciples immediately begin pouring out

of the front doors of the museum and chasing after the car.

EXT. BAZAAR - NIGHT

The convertible hauls ass down the narrow bazaar street.

Crazies start jumping out of stalls and LEAPING onto the

car. O'Connell and the others fight them off, throwing them

overboard. More people JUMP on. Jonathan SWERVES the car,

CRASHES through some stalls, knocking them off, but not before

they manage to open the back door and YANK Daniels out. He

TUMBLES across the pavement. Gets up SHOOTING. Backs into a

corner, FIRING his pistol into the hideous rabble, killing

several, keeping them at bay. His gun goes empty, CLICK!

CLICK! CLICK! But the mob stays back, looking at him like

rabid vultures. Daniels eyes them, filled with fear.

The mob parts like the red sea as Imhotep walks through them

and up to Daniels. Daniels whimpers in fear, tears pour down

his cheeks. Then he gets an idea, reaches into his pocket,

and pulls out his jewel encrusted SACRED CANOPIC JAR. He

holds it out for Imhotep. Imhotep takes it and grins. Through

his tears, Daniels grins back, hopeful that he'll be spared.

WE CUT WIDE: Somewhere in the middle of the crazed, diseased

mob, we hear Daniels give out A BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM...

INT./EXT. CONVERTIBLE - STREETS - NIGHT

The convertible slowly motors down the narrow alleys. WE

DOLLY across the hood of the car from Jonathan to Evelyn to

O'Connell. Ardeth Ray and the Curator are still in the back.

All of them staring out the front windshield. Freaked-out.

Then suddenly one of the hideous ghouls CRASHES through the

windshield! Everybody SCREAMS. Jonathan hits the gas, loses

control, the car SLAMS into a wall. O'Connell grabs Evelyn.

They all leap out of the car. But the angry, festering mob

quickly surrounds them. O'Connell quickly reaches into his

gunny-sack, pulls out a stick of dynamite, then reaches into

his pocket and pulls out a match. He looks around for a way

to light it, then reaches over and strikes it across Ardeth

Ray's stubbly face. Ardeth Ray YELPS. O'Connell holds the

lit match near the fuse.

The crazed, CHANTING mob gives O'Connell a wide berth, staring

at him and the others with insane, bloodshot eyes.

And then Imhotep steps through, -- having fully regenerated,

he now looks as young and handsome and muscular as he did

the day he was buried alive. Evelyn stares at him.

O'Connell gives her a look, the match burns his fingers. He

YELPS and throws it down, grabs another match and strikes it

across Ardeth Ray's face again. Ardeth Ray YELPS and gives

O'Connell a look to kill. The Curator shakes his head.

Imhotep moves forward, heading right for them. O'Connell

LIGHTS THE FUSE. Imhotep steps up to O'Connell and stops,

watching the fuse burn down. it's a game of chicken. The

tension mounts. The LIT FUSE is about to vanish inside the

stick of dynamite, blowing it up, -- when Evelyn leans forward

and blows it out. O'Connell exhales, but keeps his eyes on

Imhotep, who extends his hand to Evelyn.

Beni steps through the swarming mass, translating.

Evelyn hesitates, looks around at the huge, bloodthirsty

crowd surrounding them, holding axes, picks and scimitars,

waiting to pounce, then she looks at Imhotep, confident,

powerful, invincible. Then she looks at O'Connell.

O'Connell talks through angry, grit teeth.

Evelyn looks back at Imhotep, then starts to reach out to

take his hand. Both O'Connell and Jonathan move to stop her, --

but Ardeth Ray grabs them both and holds them tight.

Evelyn's trembling hand touches Imhotep's: His hand closes

around hers. Nothing happens. Imhotep smiles.

Evelyn gives Beni a nasty look, correcting him --

Then she looks at O'Connell and puts on her best face.

O'Connell almost smiles.

Imhotep suddenly notices something. He reaches forward and --

RIPS THE KEY/BOX OUT OF JONATHAN'S UPPER JACKET POCKET.

Ardeth Ray holds Jonathan back. Imhotep pulls Evelyn away.

O'Connell can't take it anymore, he tries to break free of

Ardeth Ray's grip.

The huge, powerful man holds him tight.

The crowd parts for Imhotep and Evelyn. And then Imhotep

stops and looks back at O'Connell.

Evelyn SCREAMS.

Beni smiles.

Imhotep pulls her away. O'Connell breaks free of Ardeth Ray's

grip and stumbles forward.

But the rabid vultures are already moving in for the kill.

O'Connell quickly bends down, pulls open a CISTERN/MANHOLE

COVER and shoves Jonathan down inside it, then jumps in after

him. The Curator pushes Ardeth Ray towards the cistern hole.

The Curator turns and throws himself at the mob as Ardeth

Ray crawls down into the hole. The mob tears the Curator

apart.

INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT

O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray slosh their way down the

watery catacomb, crazies pouring in behind them. Up ahead, a

LIGHT suddenly shines in from another cistern hole, and then

more of the infected crowd drop down, SCREECHING like rats.

O'Connell jags right, pushing Jonathan and Ardeth Ray ahead

of him, he strikes a match off the wall, lights the nubby

fuse on a stick of dynamite, throws it, and runs like hell.

FIRE BLAST incinerates a bunch of crazies.

STREET - ALLEY - NIGHT

The EXPLOSION blows a cistern cover fifty feet into the air,

followed by a mass of FLAMMAGE...

EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

A sewer grate is kicked out of a wall. O'Connell, Jonathan

and Ardeth Ray climb out of the hole and into AN ALLEY.

O'Connell looks at Ardeth Ray.

Jonathan looks worried.

Ardeth Ray looks at O'Connell.

Jonathan taps him in the shoulder.

Ardeth Ray ignores him.

O'Connell smiles.

And on that WE SMASH CUT TO -- THE ERFOUD DUNES - DAWN

Jonathan's bashed-in convertible steams it's way up to a set

of semi-abandoned Quonset huts. A single WWI BIPLANE with

R.A.F. INSIGNIAS sits in the sand beside them. A SIGN READS:

EXT. QUONSET HUT - DUNES - MINUTES LATER

O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray stand before Winston

Havlock, the massive dunes of Erfoud as our background.

Winston looks intrigued.

This really interests him.

Winston nods his head, he's hooked.

A slow grin spreads across Winston's face, then he gives

them a snappy salute.

SAHARA - DAY

Way off across the desert, a large SAND-DEVIL races over the

dunes. The SANDY WHIRLWIND comes to a stop and starts to

dissipate. Evelyn and Beni are suddenly ejected out of it,

they land in a dune. The SWIRLING SAND CONDENSES AND FORMS

INTO IMHOTEP. He looks up into the sky, listening carefully.

Evelyn shakes the sand out of her hair and looks at Beni.

Then they hear a plane in the sky and look up.

INT. BIPLANE - DAY

The WIND whips at Winston in the cockpit. O'Connell sits in

the gunner's compartment. Jonathan is strapped spread-eagle

across the left wing, Ardeth Ray is tied tight to the right.

Both men are scared out of their wits and SCREAMING in fear.

EXT. SAHARA - DAY

Imhotep's jaw UNHINGES, his mouth opens to an inhuman size,

he lets fly with another one of his horrible SHRIEKS. -- And

a massive WALL OF SAND rises up out of the desert

BIPLANE - DAY

O'Connell watches the desert below him come alive and rise

up towards the plane. Winston looks over the side and sees

what's coming. He laughs, throws the throttle, and puts the

plane into a dive.

WE GO WIDE AS: The sandstorm chases the diving, twisting

biplane. Getting closer and closer, about to engulf it.

O'Connell looks back into the blinding sand and sees a GIANT

FACE forming inside the sandstorm. It's Imhotep. Grinning.

O'Connell grabs the Lewis machine-gun, cocks the bracket and

FIRES, blasting away at Imhotep's giant face inside the

sandstorm. Imhotep's face begins to laugh, then his jaw

unhinges, his mouth opens wide, and he ENGULFS the plane.

Winston blindly fights for control, elated.

The biplane SPINS inside the BLOWING SAND. Engines ROARING.

Wind HOWLING. Jonathan and Ardeth Ray SCREAMING. Winston

Havlock LAUGHING.

O'Connell braces himself for impact,

SAHARA - DAY

Evelyn leaps to her feet and runs over to Imhotep.

Imhotep grabs her, pulls her close, her beautiful eyes stare

into his shockingly intense ones. Then he kisses her, hard.

Evelyn's eyes widen, stunned and mesmerized, then she pushes

herself away and falls back into the sand. Imhotep laughs.

EXT. BIPLANE - DUNES - DAY

The biplane SMASHES over a dune, ROLLS OVER and CRASHES upside-

down into another dune. The SAND SWIRLS as O'Connell falls

out of the gunner's compartment. The left wing is jammed

into the dune, Jonathan hangs upside down.

O'Connell goes to help Jonathan. Ardeth Ray stumbles over to

the gunner's compartment and tears the Lewis gun off it's

mount. He throws the machine-gun over one shoulder, a

cartridge belt over the other and staggers away. O'Connell

and Jonathan look into the cockpit. Winston Havlock is dead.

A smile on his face. The plane suddenly starts to move, the

sand sinks under their feet, they quickly high-tail-it away.

O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray make it to some rocks and

look back. The biplane, with Winston Havlock inside, slides

away over a dune. O'Connell gives it a salute. The plane

vanishes over the dune and into the SWIRLING SAND...

HAMUNAPTRA - DAY

O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray come down a ravine in the

volcano and look out over the ruins of Hamunaptra.

HAMUNAPTRA STAIRWAY - DAY

Carrying TORCHES, O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray make

their way down a long, winding, narrow staircase. Heading

into the bowels of the necropolis. A passageway to hell.

NECROPOLIS - DAY

Evelyn follows Imhotep into the underground cemetery. She

stops at the sight of all the big hairy rats scurrying through

the mausoleums and over the gravestones. Beni shoves his

rifle into her back and pushes her forward.

Evelyn gives him a look.

Beni suddenly looks worried.

Beni looks even more worried, he nervously starts chewing on

his lip. All three of them walk over the bridge crossing the

disgusting DETRITUS MOAT. Evelyn looks down at it, horrified.

INT. PASSAGEWAY - DAY

O'Connell and Ardeth Ray are busy digging out a collapsed

doorway. Jonathan notices an AMETHYST SCARAB on the far wall.

He walks over and tries to jiggle it free. It comes loose in

his hand. He looks at the scarab in his palm. It starts to

glow. And then something inside it starts to WIGGLE.

The wiggling continues; a long, agonizing BEAT, and then the

scarab breaks out of it's cocoon and instantly BURROWS into

Jonathan's palm. Jonathan starts to freak out and SCREAM.

O'Connell runs up and rips the arm off Jonathan's shirt. The

scarab is now BURROWING UP JONATHAN'S ARM. O'Connell whips

out his butterfly-knife, snaps it open and grabs Jonathan's

arm. Jonathan's eyes widen in terror as the knife passes in

front of his face. Jonathan SCREAMS LOUDER, obviously being

cut open. O'Connell's hand flicks something away.

The scarab hits the floor and immediately starts scurrying

back towards Jonathan, wanting to finish the job.

O'Connell pulls out his gun and blows it away, -- BLAM!

INT. CEMETERY - DAY

The GUNSHOT echoes into the cemetery as Imhotep, Evelyn and

Beni step-up to the strange ALTAR, where four thousand years

ago Imhotep tried to bring Anck-su-namun back to life.

Imhotep scowls at the sound and angrily reaches into a CANOPIC

JAR. He pulls out the crusted remains of Anck-su-namun's

heart, crushes it to dust in his hand and starts reading

from The Book Of The Dead. Then he BLOWS the dust against a

mausoleum wall, -- THE WALL STARTS TO COME ALIVE.

Evelyn and Beni stare at the wall, both of them wide-eyed.

TWO FORMS emerge from the mausoleum's wall. Horrific-looking

mummified CORPSES. Two of Imhotep's long dead Priests.

They bow to Imhotep, then turn and move off down a passageway.

INT. PASSAGEWAY - DAY

O'Connell helps Ardeth Ray mend Jonathan's wound.

Jonathan swallows hard and nods vigorously.

INT. CEMETERY - DAY

Imhotep prepares the altar while speaking in HEBREW. Beni

holds his gun on her, translating:

Evelyn blushes, feeling complimented by the handsome prince.

Imhotep continues SPEAKING while laying the four jewel

encrusted canopic jars next to the shattered one.

Evelyn's eyes widen.

Evelyn can't believe it, she furiously turns to Imhotep.

Imhotep looks at her and grins, then BACKHANDS her -- WAP!

Evelyn goes down for the count. Imhotep stares at her, cold,

malevolent, then he turns and walks off into the mausoleums.

Beni nervously glances around, then quickly scurries away.

TREASURE CHAMBER - DAY

O'Connell squeezes through a small crevice in a wall and

drops to the floor of a dark chamber. He picks up his

gunnysack and scans the darkness. Something GLITTERS. Jonathan

and Ardeth Ray crawl in behind him.

O'Connell notices a SHAFT OF LIGHT, high above him, shooting

through a small hole in the ceiling and stopping against a

wall next to one of those mirror disks. O'Connell aims his

gun. FIRES. The bullet STRIKES the disk's pedestal, spinning

the mirror into the shaft of light, -- And WHAM! THE SHAFT

OF LIGHT HITS THE DISK AND QUICKLY BOUNCES AROUND THE ROOM

FROM ONE DISK TO ANOTHER UNTIL THE WHOLE CHAMBER IS LIT UP.

It's an enormous TREASURE CHAMBER. Filled to overflowing.

Everything sparkles and shines. The wealth of Egypt.

O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray are speechless. That's

when the two mummified Priest-mummies walk in.

O'Connell pulls the elephant gun out of his gunny-sack.

O'Connell FIRES the elephant gun. SMOKE and FLAME shoot out.

BLASTS one of the mummies. Blows it's upper torso clean off.

O'Connell pumps the gun, the huge spent cartridge flips

through the air. He FIRES again. BLASTS the other mummy,

blows this one's torso clean off as well. The smoke clears.

The two sets of LEGS keep walking forward, unaffected by the

loss of their upper torsos. O'Connell can't believe it.

And then the disemboweled upper torsos start to move, turning

over and crawling towards our heroes, who start to back away.

INT. CEMETERY - DAY

Imhotep turns from the altar as he hears more GUNSHOTS echoing

out of the passageways. He angrily reaches into another of

Anck-su-namun's canopic jars, pulls out her crusty liver and

crushes it to dust, then quickly starts reading a passage

from the Book and BLOWS the dust down a passageway.

INT. TREASURE CHAMBER - DAY

A dusty BREEZE blows into the chamber as O'Connell, Jonathan

and Ardeth Ray back away from the mummy pieces. The floor

where they were just standing suddenly STARTS TO MOVE. Two

more mummies slowly dig their way up out of the floor. More

mummies start coming out of the walls and crawling out of

the piles of gold. All the mummies head for our heroes.

O'Connell lifts the elephant gun. Ardeth Ray stops him.

Ardeth Ray OPENS UP with the Lewis gun. BLASTING the shit

out of the mummies. They keep on coming. Even more now.

O'Connell OPENS FIRE with the elephant gun, pumping and FIRING

as all three of the men back away and haul ass. The mummies

and mummy pieces follow them into the passageway.

Then Beni creeps into the chamber. He stares in wonder at

all the treasure. Then falls backwards into a pile of jewels

and rolls about.

INT. CEMETERY - DAY

Evelyn wakes up, lying chained to the top of the altar. She

blinks, then turns her head, -- and looks right into the

ROTTED FACE of Anck-su-namun's corpse. Evelyn SCREAMS.

INT. LABYRINTH PASSAGEWAYS - DAY

The elephant gun FIRES, blasting FLAME and SMOKE right into

the LENS. O'Connell, Jonathan and Ardeth Ray race down a

passageway, a dozen mummies striding after them.

The men race around a corner. More mummies. They race around

another corner. More mummies. Onward they come. Methodical.

Relentless. Boxing in our heroes. O'Connell and Ardeth Ray

FIRING as they go. Ardeth Ray goes empty.

He throws the machine-gun down and they all race into --

HORUS' CHAMBER - DAY

-- A small chamber. The lower half of the giant statue of

HORUS stands in the middle of the chamber.

They run up to the base of the statue,

O'Connell looks back at the mummies coming down the

passageway. He reaches into his gunny-sack and pulls out a

stick of dynamite. Ardeth Ray taps him on the shoulder.

O'Connell hands him the dynamite and a match, then turns to

look at the statue. Ardeth Ray reaches forward and strikes

the match off O'Connell's stubbly face. O'Connell YELPS.

Ardeth Ray lights the dynamite and throws it down the

passageway. They all hit the deck. The dynamite EXPLODES.

Ripping apart the creatures, causing a CAVE-IN and sealing

the passageway with rock and dirt. Now there's only one way

out, -- another dark, creepy passageway.

INT. CEMETERY

Chained tight to the top of the altar, Evelyn hopelessly

struggles to free herself. She stops as Priest mummies start

surrounding the altar. Evelyn is horrified as the hideous

mummies kneel down and begin to CHANT, -- which now sounds

even more horrific due to the lack of tongues, jaws and mouths

in the room.

Imhotep steps up carrying the black Book Of The Dead. His

hand reaches out and lovingly caresses Anck-su-namun's decayed

cheek.

INT. HORUS' CHAMBER - DAY

O'Connell and Jonathan are digging away at the seams of the

secret compartment, it starts to give. And that's when Ardeth

Ray spots another group of rotting mummies coming down the

dark passageway, heading right for them. O'Connell looks up.

Ardeth Ray grabs the elephant gun and a handful of shells

and runs off towards the mummies.

O'Connell and Jonathan redouble their efforts, pulling harder

on the seam. The compartment starts to loosen. About to give.

The last time this happened, salt acid sprayed out, remember?

Our heroes keep tugging. The tension mounts...

And that's when a SKELETAL HAND BURSTS UP OUT OF THE GROUND

and grabs O'Connell's ankle. Several more moldy hands BURST

up out of the ground. O'Connell and Jonathan struggle with

the mummies as they crawl up out of the dirt floor.

One of the mummies violently shoves O'Connell away. Another

grabs Jonathan by the throat and starts to strangle him. A

third mummy grabs at the secret compartment and pulls hard.

AN INTENSE BURST OF ACID SPRAYS OUT OF THE SEAM AND HITS ALL

THREE OF THE MUMMIES. The one strangling Jonathan gets it in

the back and drops him. All three mummies melt horribly.

INT. CEMETERY

Imhotep begins to read from The Book Of The Dead.

A large SWIRLING HOLE starts to open in the detritus bog.

Evelyn's eyes widen in amazement and horror.

INT. HORUS' CHAMBER - DAY

Ardeth Ray BLASTS AWAY at the oncoming mummies. over at the

base of the statue, O'Connell and Jonathan pull an ornate

chest out of the secret compartment. O'Connell rips off the

lid, reaches inside and pulls out a heavy burlap bag.

He and Jonathan exchange nervous, excited looks. Then he

reaches into the bag and slowly pulls out the SOLID GOLD

Book Of The Living -- GOLDEN LIGHT reflects off their faces

as they stare at it in wonder.

The elephant gun goes empty. Ardeth Ray takes it by the barrel

and wades into the remaining mummies swinging.

The mummies quickly overwhelm and start to tear him apart.

O'Connell lights the last stick of dynamite and throws it

against the far wall. He and Jonathan hit the deck.

The wall BLOWS. Debris COLLAPSES, -- but now here's a hole

for them to get out. O'Connell and Jonathan race out through

the hole just as the remaining mummies enter the chamber.

EXT. HAMUNAPTRA RUINS - DAY

Outside, Beni staggers across the sand with a saddlebag filled

with treasure. He throws it over the rear of a camel.

Starts to climb up. Hesitates. Looks back at the temple door.

Licks his lips. And then his greed gets the better of him

and he quickly climbs down and scurries back towards the

door.

INT. CEMETERY - DAY

Imhotep READS from the Book. The rotten Priest-mummies rock

back and forth, CHANTING. Evelyn struggles.

Then suddenly, the strange MIST wafts up out of the swirling

hole and over to the sacred jars, it passes through them and

into Evelyn. Evelyn JERKS as though she's been electrified.

The MIST passes through her and into Anck-su-namun's body.

The CHANTING PRIESTS, SWIRLING HOLE, WAFTING MIST and

IMHOTEP'S READINGS reach a crescendo. Anck-su-namun's crusty

EYELIDS suddenly POP OPEN. Evelyn stares at her in disbelief.

Anck-su-namun's rotted head turns and looks at Evelyn with

empty sockets. Evelyn freaks out and struggles wildly, then

she notices Imhotep holding the ancient sacrificial knife.

He raises it up over Evelyn's chest, about to plunge it down.

Evelyn's eyes widen in horror. And that's when O'Connell and

Jonathan BURST IN. Imhotep spins around and faces them.

Jonathan beams as he holds up the golden Book Of The Living.

O'Connell grabs an ancient sword out of a statue's hand,

jumps up onto a gravestone and leaps out over the Priests.

The Priest-mummies stop chanting. The MIST vanishes.

Imhotep steps forward. O'Connell STRIKES the sacrificial

knife out of his hand. Imhotep BELLOWS a command. The Priests

stand up, swords and knives in hand, they ATTACK O'Connell.

EVERYTHING HAPPENS AT ONCE, READ FASTER:

O'Connell RACKS and CHOPS at the attacking Priest-mummies,

fighting his way to Evelyn. The skeletal creatures wildly

SWING their swords, trying to STAB O'Connell. Jonathan fumbles

with the book, struggling to open it, -- he can't.

O'Connell CUTS two of the mummies in half, then swings his

sword down at Evelyn, -- CLANG! One chain breaks free.

Jonathan spots a series of SOLID GOLD, FOUR-SIDED LOCKS along

the binder. It hits him like lightning --

Imhotep grins, then grabs the KEY/BOX hanging from a chain

around his neck, rips it off and shoves it into his pocket

He picks up the sacrificial sword and heads for Jonathan.

O'Connell swings his sword down again, -- CLANG! Evelyn now

has one hand and one leg free. More mummies attack O'Connell

force him back.

Jonathan quickly starts translating the cover inscription,

but his ancient Egyptian is clearly awful.

Jonathan starts to backpedal through the cemetery, clutching

the golden book; wide-eyed, as Imhotep moves in on him.

Jonathan trips and falls on his ass. Imhotep CHARGES FORWARD.

O'Connell SLASHES another chain. Only one more left holding

Evelyn. Jonathan sits up and quickly looks back at the cover.

Imhotep raises the sacrificial sword, about to kill Jonathan.

And that's when the giant statue of Anubis suddenly CRASHES

through the wall -- shades of Ray Harryhausen. Only better.

The god of Deaths, horrible, decrepit STONE FACE stares

angrily down. Jonathan stares back.

O'Connell DECAPITATES a mummy and looks up at Anubis.

Imhotep leaves Jonathan and heads for the giant statue.

O'Connell leaps over and with one last swing of the sword,

frees Evelyn from her chains. More Priest-mummies attack,

forcing him away. Evelyn jumps off the altar and starts to

head for O'Connell, -- a SKELETAL HAND grabs her! Spins her

around. It's Anck-su-namun's rotted corpse. Evelyn reacts.

Imhotep looks up at Anubis, points to O'Connell, and in

ANCIENT EGYPTIAN commands him to attack. Anubis moves for

O'Connell, STOMPING over mausoleums and through the detritus

moat on his way. O'Connell quickly backs away.

Evelyn is backing away from Anck-su-namun.

Anck-su-namun ATTACKS Evelyn. Evelyn fends her off as best

she can. Jonathan quickly looks back at the hieroglyphs on

the book cover, fumbling badly under the pressure --

Anck-su-namun grabs Evelyn by the throat. The statue of Anubis

corners O'Connell, reaches down and GRABS him with it's

MASSIVE TALONS. O'Connell HACKS away at it. Jonathan stares

at the inscription, slightly oblivious.

Evelyn is being STRANGLED by Anck-su-namun.

The talons lift O'Connell up and start to CRUSH him.

The giant statue of Anubis instantly freezes in it's tracks

and PETRIFIES. It's off balance. Starts to fall. O'Connell

slides free of it's talons. Evelyn SHOVES Anck-su-namun away,

Anck-su-namun looks up and opens her fetid mouth to scream

just as Anubis CRASHES DOWN on top of her, SMASHING HER to

powder and DRIVING her into the ground.

Imhotep SHRIEKS in rage and horror, then turns and angrily

heads for Jonathan. Jonathan, sitting on his ass, quickly

backpedals on his hands and heels.

O'Connell leaps to his feet, sword in hand and runs for

Imhotep. Imhotep grabs Jonathan, lifts him up, rips the golden

Book Of The Living out of his hand and pins him to a wall.

O'Connell runs up and swings his sword at Imhotep, -- WAP!

SLICES Imhotep's right arm off. It drops to the ground, still

clutching The Book Of The Living. Imhotep drops Jonathan and

spins around, facing O'Connell. O'Connell grins.

Imhotep grabs O'Connell with his left arm and THROWS him

half way across the cemetery. O'Connell SLAMS into a

gravestone, bounces off and crashes to the ground. He shakes

it off.

Imhotep is already striding towards him. Jonathan lifts up

his hand, -- HE HAS THE KEY/BOX BACK! He smiles at Evelyn.

Evelyn runs for Jonathan.

O'Connell SWINGS his sword and CLEAVES a big chunk of molten

flesh rot out of Imhotep's stomach. On the outside, Imhotep

looks human, but on the inside he is still a rotten old mummy.

Imhotep BACKHANDS O'Connell. Knocks him twenty feet back.

O'Connell staggers to his feet. Imhotep is right there. CLUBS

him hard with his left arm. O'Connell spins through the air,

SLAMS into the side of a mausoleum. Imhotep approaches, rage

in his eyes. O'Connell gets up, quickly pivots and HACKS

into Imhotep's head. Imhotep grins and PUNCHES O'Connell in

the face. O'Connell is thrown back, pulling his sword with

him.

He bounces hard off the mausoleum. Lands on his feet.

Totally beat-to-shit. Knees buckling. He can barely stand.

Jonathan lifts up the heavy gold book, -- Imhotep's severed

hand still clings to it. Jonathan cringes in disgust. Evelyn

yanks it off, throws it away, then start furiously working

the key into the series of locks, unlocking each of them.

Imhotep strides forward. O'Connell backs into the mausoleum,

swings the sword, Imhotep tries to catch it, -- it CLEAVES

through his palm and deeply imbeds itself into his forearm.

No matter, Imhotep rips the sword away from O'Connell and

casually flings it away.

The golden Book Of The Living opens with a HISS. Jonathan

holds it tight as Evelyn quickly turns the heavy gold pages

looking for something.

O'Connell turns to run, but Imhotep grabs him by the throat

and lifts him off his feet. O'Connell hangs there, a dazed

mess. Imhotep grins, says something in ANCIENT EGYPTIAN,

then starts to strangle O'Connell. O'Connell chokes. About

to die.

Evelyn turns and faces Imhotep and reads an inscription:

Imhotep pivots and looks at Evelyn, a look of sheer terror

on his face. Then he looks over at the detritus bog. Which

starts to BUBBLE and SHIFT. The SWIRLING HOLE begins to open.

And then suddenly THE SPIRITS OF THE EGYPTIAN GODS waft out

of the black bog and SWIRL around the Priest-mummies. The

mummies all collapse and turn to dust. And then the spirits

attack Imhotep. Lifting him and O'Connell up into the air.

Imhotep lets go of O'Connell, who falls to the ground.

Evelyn and Jonathan fearfully stumble away from the spirits,

Jonathan trips and falls and accidentally throws The Book of

The Living into the detritus bog. Evelyn watches as the golden

book sinks into the black putrescence. Jonathan looks like

he's about to cry.

Ten feet off the ground, the spirits SWIRL around Imhotep's

body, TWISTING IT and TURNING IT and slowly SHRIVELING IT.

Accompanied by the same strange FLASHING LIGHT we saw at the

beginning of the movie when Anck-su-namun was cursed. One

last HUGE FLASH, accompanied by a BLAST OF WIND, and Imhotep

is spit out and thrown to the floor. He staggers to his feet,

he looks perfectly normal. His body is completely intact.

O'Connell swings his sword. Imhotep jerks back. The sword

scrapes Imhotep's chest, -- a swath of blood appears across

Imhotep's chest where the sword hit him. Imhotep touches the

blood on his chest, amazed and horrified. He's mortal.

O'Connell runs Imhotep through with the sword and shoves him

backwards. Imhotep stumbles back and falls into the detritus

bog. The sword still in his stomach.

Evelyn and Jonathan run up next to O'Connell. They watch as

Imhotep gently sinks into the fetid swamp, slowly dying. And

then, just before his head goes under, Imhotep looks up at

them, grins broadly, and says something in ANCIENT EGYPTIAN.

Evelyn translates:

Imhotep's grinning face vanishes under the black bile.

STAFF CHAMBER - DAY

Beni staggers across a chamber, straining under the weight

of another saddlebag filled with treasure. He spots a large,

ornate STAFF sticking out of a wall. He throws the saddlebag

over the staff and collapses against the wall. Exhausted.

A BEAT. And then the weight of the treasure PULLS THE STAFF

DOWN. Which starts a massive AURAL CHAIN-REACTION.

Beni-backs away from the wall, wide-eyed, filled with fear.

ALL THE WALLS START TO SINK INTO THE GROUND. Driven by tons

of pouring sand. Beni turns and hauls ass out of the chamber.

CEMETERY - DAY

O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan look around as all the walls

start to DESCEND. O'Connell grabs Evelyn's hand.

He pulls her forward and all three of them race past sinking

pillars. They duck as they run into a descending doorway.

INT. PASSAGEWAY - DAY

Beni scampers down a passageway, the ceiling getting lower

and lower until he has to crouch. And then he has to stick

the TORCH between his teeth and crawl on his hands and knees.

INT. TREASURE CHAMBER - DAY

O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan crouch-run into the treasure

chamber. Evelyn skids to a stop. Looks in wonder at all the

treasure. SAND rains down on them. O'Connell grabs her again

and quickly pulls her through the mounds of treasure towards

a SINKING DOORWAY on the far side of the room. The SOUND of

the sinking walls is deafening.

Beni crouch-runs into the treasure chamber. O'Connell, Evelyn

and Jonathan race past him. He joins them as they run up a

staircase. Heading for a DESCENDING DOORWAY, which is already

half gone, it's now only four feet high -- now three feet

high -- now two feet. Jonathan dives through the narrow gap.

Then O'Connell dives through, he spins around. Evelyn dives,

but gets stuck in the middle, about to get cut in half.

O'Connell grabs her arm and YANKS her through in the nick of

time. Beni reaches through the narrowing gap with his hand --

O'Connell grabs it, but it's too late. Beni yanks his hand

back just as the top of the door CRASHES to the floor.

Sealing him in. Beni quickly crawls back down the stairs as

the ceiling SLAMS down behind him. He stands up and looks

around with his diminishing torch.

All the doorways FINISH CLOSING. There's no way out. He's

trapped. And then he hears something, and turns around. Over

in the corner, a scarab-beetle stares at him, CHITTERING.

Beni waves his flickering torch at the scarab and backs away.

He stands in the middle of the treasure chamber as dozens

upon dozens of scarabs boil up out of the floor around him.

Beni is absolutely terrified. The scarabs start to move in.

And that's when Beni's torch goes out. PITCH BLACK. A BEAT.

And then we hear Beni start SCREAMING in horror and pain.

And the scarabs CHITTERING hungrily.

EXT. HAMUNAPTRA - DAY

The temple COLLAPSES as O'Connell, Evelyn, Jonathan and a

pack of stray camels race through the ruins. A SINKING CREVICE

DROPS OUT right behind them. Chasing them out through the

front gates. The whole place RUMBLES ominously.

They make it down the ramp as more ruins CRASH DOWN behind

them. A MASSIVE CLOUD OF SAND AND DUST billows out over the

wall and into the air. our heroes and all the stray camels

race out into the desert...

EXT. PLATEAU - DAY

O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan stand in the middle of the

plateau, surrounded by stray camels. They stare off at the

sandy, dusty, volcano as it continues to RUMBLE-ominously.

O'Connell looks at Evelyn.

Evelyn returns the look, A BEAT, and then she wraps-her arms

around his neck and kisses him. O'Connell returns it.

Jonathan just rolls his eyes, snorts in disgust and climbs

up onto a camel.

When the kiss is over, O'Connell and Evelyn share a smile,

then O'Connell leaps up into the saddle, reaches down, grabs

Evelyn's hand and pulls her up behind him. Evelyn wraps her

arms around his waist. O'Connell and Jonathan slap the reins.

The camels start to move out. WE PAN DOWN: to the saddlebag

behind Evelyn, hidden under the closed back flap, -- we can

see that it's filled with Beni's stolen TREASURE.

O'Connell, Evelyn and Jonathan ride off into the SUNSET.
