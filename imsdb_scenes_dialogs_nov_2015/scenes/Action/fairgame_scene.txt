SFX: SHALLOW, DESPERATE BREATHING.

Extreme close ANGLES ON

a figure kneels in a cell, in tight stress position. Bound.

Blindfold. Convulsed with intense pain. We move closer --

It's a woman.

CLANK! She is hauled to her feet by unseen hands.

She's carried head-first fast down a corridor by four men,

like a battering ram.

.. into another cell. A fifth masked man. On the table-- a

car battery.

Screams ring out down the empty corridor.

Blows rain down on her. The blindfold is torn off.

THEN---- SPLASH! She is thrust into a bath and held under

water. CLOSE ON her face, as the bubbles of her desperate

breath subside, her eyes glaze and a single smoke-swirl of

crimson blood rises up from her parted lips.

SUDDENLY -- She looks directly at us. Awake. Alert.

HAFIZ turns off onto a deserted road in the Lake Gardens.

He looks at her. Undoes his seatbelt.

He strokes her hair. She holds his eye. Composed.

The temperature in the car drops a hundred degrees.

HAFIZ's brain does 0-60 in 0.06 Seconds. He flips open the

glove box. Nothing there.

HAFIZ STOPS DEAD. LOOKS IN THE REARVIEW: A black car, 50

yards behind. He grabs her arm.

Who the fuck are you?           NOW!

He releases her arm. She holds his gaze. Breathing hard.

That's bullshit.                laundering and contraband

Bullshit. You can't help him.   We can help him. Hafiz.

lit maze of packing cases and pallets towards a concerned

looking superintendent.

packing case with a crowbar: white cardboard boxes. Valerie

draws a Buck knife and slices it open, rumaging in

polystyrene chips and comes out with a Coke sized white

plastic cylinder with two contacts at one end.

Valerie looks at the object.

A BLINDING FLASH OF PURE WHITE LIGHT becomes A GIANT BULBOUS

INT. LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL LABORATORY. EXHIBITION CENTER. DAY

year old twins, TREVOR and SAMANTHA are lost in play. Trevor

hauls in the flex of a globe lamp on a top shelf.

CRASH! -- Joe turns as the shelf GIVES WAY, and an avalanche

of books and keepsakes buries his kids. Hollers. Tears.

He lugs them out. The front door opens. It's Heather the

babysitter.

On TV, Live. The President crossing the White House Lawn,

towards Marine One.

As the kids play with Heather in the lounge, Joe makes a

coffee in the kitchen, watching the President on TV as he

mounts the ramp. The cabin door shuts tight. A wash of rotor

blades. The chopper lifts off.

Joe takes the coffee and walks out onto the deck. He looks up

into the sky. A THRUMMING BUILDS. The deck shakes, the sky

turns black as Marine One thunders over low. Deafening.

Valerie and Mike queue up in the mess with JIM PAVITT, 52 the

Deputy Director of the CIA.

Relax Mike. The Veep's just

dotting the i's.

Bullshit Jim. The only time a Vice

President comes to Langley is to

cut a fucking ribbon.

Look. Cheney doesn't trust us. This

shit with Dick goes back thirty

years. It'll blow over.

Where are we on Iraq?

Behind the curve Sir. Most of the

intel is outdated. We don't have a

single operative or asset in the

country.

What about geo-satellite imaging?

With respect sir, you can't look at

this problem from space and make a

call.

So talk to the defectors.

The defectors are unreliable. Most

are supplied through a former asset

the agency's had on a burn notice

since `95. It's a racket. They walk

in and get paid to say whatever the

Pentagon wants to hear.

So we're blind.

We need sources we can rely on. We

need to get in close.

How close?

Inside.

Pavitt looks at her.

He stands there. Thrown.

The old man looks perplexed. Even a little amused. He sits.

He stares at the floor.

He remains motionless. Valerie watches him closely.

He looks up at Valerie tears in his eyes

He walks over to the window. SLOWLY he takes off his jacket.

His shirt, pulls it off over his head and turns his back to

her. He's been mutilated and burned all up his back. Slowly

he turns. Deep scars. Burns.

A couple of colleagues are waiting outside.

ANALYST 1 drifts his way back to his desk. ANALYST 2

swallows, and disappears into the `interrogation' room.

INT. BATHROOM. DAY.

PAUL, the chief analyst, comes out of the stall. ANALYST 2 is

there, throwing up in the sink.

Scooter listens patiently to PAUL, the chief analyst.

notes off, then, deliberately, drops them in the bin.

sits on the edge of a bed wearing a long black traditional

Abaya. There are two other agents there, with Valerie. One of

them is holding a notebook..

He whips out a zippo. Sets fire to one. It's gone in a flash.

The other agent shows her a pen.

They look to Val for a decision. She can't help but smile.

Later. The agents have gone. Just Sawsan and Valerie.

She's trying to drink her tea, but she's shaking. Val takes

her hand and silently grips it.

She searches Valerie's face.

Valerie looks at her. Before she can answer we --

A taxi cab stops and SAWSAN is helped out by the driver.

From a car across the street -- Valerie watches:

Ali and Valerie get out the car looking every bit like

tourists, suitcases, sunglasses, guidebook etc.

INT. QUEEN ALIA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT. AMMAN. JORDAN.

Valerie and Ali enter the revolving doors and follow her at a

distance across the shiny beige and gold marble floors.

By the the check in desk for the Gulf Air flight to Baghdad

Valerie and Ali have stopped in a electronic goods store.

Valerie aims her zoom lens camera and as if appraising it as

a purchase, firing off some shots of the Iraqi agents.

Sawsan reaches the desk and is stopped by the two men.

They watch her talking to the men, handing over her passport.

The Iraqi agent stares at her. He asks a question in arabic

No subtitles. Sawsan responds. She remains cool, almost

disinterested. The men exchange sentences of arabic.

Valerie watches from a distance. Heart beating. At last they

Alone, Sawsan rolls her small suitcase across the polished

floor past a group of Iraqi soldiers. A Saddam-a-like in a

dark suit takes her passport. His eyes bore into her.

He takes her suitcase from her. HEART THUMPING. He leads her

out of the queue, down a strip lit corridor and into a

windowless room in bowels of the airport.

He shuts the door. Sawsan tries to control her breathing.

Hands search through her luggage. They unwrap a framed

photograph of SAWSAN and her daughter, smiling. The officer

Another missile lands nearby. The building shakes. The

picture of Sawsan shifts. Dust falls like fine rain over the

small kitchen. Sa'ad unpacks food on the rickety table. Under

it, his wife, children cower. He passes down bread. Cheese.

The baby is crying.

There is a KNOCK AT THE DOOR. On the other side are two men.
