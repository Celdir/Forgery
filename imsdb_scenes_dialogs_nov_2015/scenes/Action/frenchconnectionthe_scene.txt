EXT. A BAR IN BED-STUY - DAY

A large man in a Santa Claus suit and white beard is

entertaining a group of black children.  He leads them in

the singing of a Christmas Carol (Hark the Herald Angels

Sing).  The man is DETECTIVE FIRST GRADE JIMMY DOYLE.  His

attention is split between the children and the activity

inside the bar.

INT. THE BAR - DOYLE'S POV - DAY

The place is crowded with mid-day drinkers.  Dimly outlined

at the far end of the bar are TWO BLACK MEN involved in some

kind of transaction in which a package is exchanged for

money.  As the transaction seems to be completed, cut to

EXT. THE BAR - DAY

Santa Claus (DOYLE) starts to ring his big Christmas bell,

above the singing.  The bell is a signal to DETECTIVE SECOND

GRADE BUDDY RUSSO.  At this moment RUSSO is in the clothes

of a hot dog vendor and is in fact working behind a hot dog

wagon.  At the ringing of DOYLE's bell he takes off his

apron, leaves the wagon, and runs toward the bar.

INT. THE BAR - DAY

RUSSO enter the bar on the run.  He stops and looks over the

room.

RUSSO'S POV

There are TWENTY or THIRTY MEN at the bar, at least TEN are

wearing brown coats!  The TWO MEN involved in the deal see

RUSSO and start to run.  One (THE BUYER) takes off out of

the back door.  The other (THE PUSHER) jumps over the bar

and heads for the front entrance.

EXT. THE BAR - DAY

THE PUSHER dashes out past Santa Claus (DOYLE).  RUSSO

follows him and all three give chase.

EXT. BED-STUY TENEMENT ALLEY - DAY

THREE FIGURES running down a New York tenement alley, the

first in flight, the others in pursuit.  We pick up the

incredible clutter of such an alley, mounts of rusting beer

cans, paper bags of garbage bulging and ripping open, old

bed springs, burned out mattresses, etc.

EXT. BED-STUY TENEMENT ALLEY - DAY

Close shot of BLACK PUSHER tripping on the tangle of trash

going up against the wall in his stumble, face toward the

camera, and the figures of RUSSO and DOYLE leaping upon him

from off-camera.  There is a blur or fast struggle as DOYLE

and RUSSO try to get his arms and put him against the wall.

BLACK PUSHER writhes loose and we close in on a knife in his

hand, plunging rapidly into RUSSO'S left forearm.

The words are both warning and a grunt of pain.  As RUSSO

takes the blade and utters the words, we simultaneously go

to DOYLE crouching and snatching his .38 out of the right

ankle holster.

EXT. BED-STUY TENEMENT ALLEY - DAY

Close shot of DOYLE and the BLACK PUSHER, DOYLE pistol-

whipping him into submission with three lightening chops of

the gun to the PUSHER'S head.  DOYLE continues to beat the

man mercilessly into submission.

INT. DOYLE'S CAR - DAY

3-shot of BLACK PUSHER sitting between DOYLE and RUSSO.

DOYLE is at the wheel.  BLACK PUSHER is sitting on his

hands, wrists manacled behind him, his head down and dripping

blood onto the jacket and the canary-yellow turtleneck.  All

three are breathing hard.

DOYLE hits him across the face.

BLACK PUSHER doesn't look up.

No response.

BLACK PUSHER's brow furrows, looks up just a little.

The BLACK PUSHER'S eyes go to RUSSO in panic, looking for

relief from the pressure of the inquisition.

The BLACK PUSHER's eyes are on DOYLE, frozen in confusion

and fear.

EXT. HEADQUARTERS NARCOTICS BUREAU OF THE NYPD 12 OLD SLIP

AND SOUTH STREETS - NIGHT

DOYLE and RUSSO standing side by side on the front steps of

the old First Precinct on the Lower East Side of Manhattan.

RUSSO has his overcoat over his shoulders as a cape.  The

sleeve of his left arm is rolled up over a blood-stained

bandage on the left forearm.

RUSSO nods in acceptance of the remark.  The easy, synical

rapport between them is obvious: they are partners in a

business where somebody is always getting hurt and pain is

part of the inventory.

DOYLE reaches into the right side pocket of BUDDY's suitcoat

for a cigarette and matches.  He lights up two in the pause,

sticks one in RUSSO's mouth.

INT. THE CLUB - NIGHT

THE TITLES COMMENCE

Titles over a close shot of a chorus line, with lots of tits

and ass and lean, long legs in a brassy blare of music.  We

zoom back to the area where DOYLE and RUSSO are beginning to

occupy a table.  RUSSO takes the seat on the right, eyes

immediately on all that ginch, while DOYLE standing, gives

their order.  We do not hear the dialogue but DOYLE asks

RUSSO what he wants BUDDY looks up and says "Cinzano." DOYLE

turns and says "Two of these." DOYLE slips into the chair

opposite RUSSO and the titles roll on.  Unlike RUSSO who is

concentrating on the girls, DOYLE is digging the room and

the people who occupy the tables in it, as if he is the sort

of man who cannot relax until he knows who is around him,

why they are there.

INT. THE CLUB - NIGHT

A long view from DOYLE's position of the room, a quick

certain survey that stumbles twice; on laughter that seems

too raw and then over a flurry of activity by WAITERS and

CAPTAINS serving a table on the main floor.  DOYLE's

attention is apprehended by the noise and activity that

emanate from the same large table.

INT. THE CLUB - NIGHT

A long view of the table with DOYLE and RUSSO very close

foreground, left and right.  DOYLE is leaning on an elbow.

RUSSO's eyes come off the show.  It is a direct line from

DOYLE's gaze to the round, ruddy and arrogant face of SAL

BOCA, the apparent host of the table of EIGHT MEN AND WOMEN,

the Men in dinner jackets with ties tucked under the collars

of blue or white lace-trimmed shirts, the Women in a mixture

of pant suits and Catskills cocktail party dresses, their

hair coiffed towers.

Zoom in slowly on SAL as he deals tips and orders.  Through

DOYLE's eyes, we go from Guest to Guest at SAL's table,

taking apart their manners and styles as they talk and

laugh, lost in the show chatter.

INT. THE CLUB - NIGHT

DOYLE finishing his drink, still looking at the table.

INT. THE CLUB - NIGHT

The camera pans down the table to dig the "creep on the end."

INT. THE CLUB - NIGHT

DOYLE close in right profile, SAL's table in the far blurred

background.

INT/EXT. DOYLE'S CAR - NIGHT

The view from the back seat of DOYLE's car.  DOYLE is at the

wheel, RUSSO packed uncomfortably into the corner at DOYLE's

right.  Seventy-five yards away on the other side of the

street the canopied entrance of the Club.  A Continental is

parked in front of the club.  The DRIVER leaning on a fender

talking with the DOORMAN.  DOYLE frisks his own pockets for

a cigarette, coming up with a collection of laundry slips,

crumpled notes, toothpicks and matches.

One of the slips of paper catches his eye as he is going

through the ritual of the cigarette mooch, a slip bearing

the name of a girl.  His attention is really on the entrance

of the Club and both his conversation and the cigarette

business are detached and incidental to the art of waiting

through the stakeout.  He stuffs the cards back into his

pocket.

As soon as DOYLE has finished lighting the cigarette SAL and

his PARTY come bubbling out of the Club noisily, a little

drunkenly.  SAL waves to the attentive DOORMAN.

DOYLE close, leaning forward over the wheel to put his hand

on the ignition key.  He does not turn it.  He is waiting

for the cover of noise from the starting of SAL's car.

RUSSO is turning the opposite corner of the car into a bend,

his head back, arms across his chest.

DOYLE reaches under his seat for the straw surveillance

hat - throws it up to read ledge of car.

A long view of the Club entrance.  SAL and ANGIE, a well-

built "classy" blonde with good legs, get into their black

Mercury sedan.  The Mercury takes off towards First Avenue.

We hear DOYLE's car start and we move off after them on the

last blink of tail-lights at the corner.

EXT. BROADWAY - NIGHT

Cabs, Daily News and Times delivery trucks, bakery vans and

a few cruising cabs, one or two passenger cars and a coasting

green and black police cruiser -- this is the 4:30 a.m.

traffic through which DOYLE moves.

A rear-window view of SAL and ANGIE BOCA, in animated

conversation.  His head is turned toward her, his hand

raised in a gesture.  ANGIE is sitting in a corner with her

back to the door, in profile to the back window.

Her blonde head bobbles with laughter over some remark SAL

has made.

A long overhead view of the two cars wheeling in and out of

the sparse traffic.

Close shot of the license plate on BOCA's car.

Close shot DOYLE staring at license plate, memorizing it.

EXT. RATNER'S - DAY

BOCA and ANGIE exit restaurant, get into their car and drive

off.  Hold for DOYLE's car as it passes through after them.

EXT. MULBERRY STREET - DAY

Side close view of SAL turning south into Mott Street

panning to pick up the Italian names on the candy stores,

funeral parlors, bars, grocery stores, social clubs.

A long view of SAL's car from the DOYLE-RUSSO auto, over the

shoulders of the two cops.  DOYLE is leaning on the wheel of

his car.  He's against the curb about 100 yards behind SAL.

Medium close view of SAL in the middle of Mott Street,

walking quickly toward the opposite side of the street,

hands in the pocket of his white raincoat.  He glances over

his shoulder in the direction of DOYLE's car.

Close of RUSSO who has come awake.  The smart-ass demeanor

has dropped away.  DOYLE turns to him and smiles.  This

district is the heart of every illegal activity in New York.

Close rear view of DOYLE and RUSSO ducking down to the level

of the dashboard, a reflex action.  He couldn't see them at

that distance, although SAL, lighted by his own headlights,

can be seen in the background walking around the cars,

across the sidewalk and stopped at a recessed doorway.

Medium close shot of SAL and partially visible FIGURE at the

doorway.  With another glance up the street, SAL takes

something out of his raincoat pocket and steps up and into

the doorway.

INT. DOYLE'S CAR - DAY

Close from the front of DOYLE and RUSSO low against the

dashboard.

DOYLE's face, close, light smile.

Long view of SAL walking down the sidewalk quickly for about

a quarter of a block while the headlights of his car, with

ANGIE apparently driving, move up with him.  At another

doorway, he looks back and then steps inside.

EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY

Long view of SAL's Mercury moving over Brooklyn Bridge.

Close shot of the DOYLE-RUSSO car from RUSSO's side.  BUDDY

now interested, watching.

corner, then DOYLE's Ford.

cars (as seen from DOYLE-RUSSO car) stopping and parking.

Hold on Mercury as SAL and ANGIE get out of it.  SAL locking

it up, and starting to walk toward a line of parked cars.

Close shot from rear seat of DOYLE and RUSSO glancing at

each other.

SAL and ANGIE stop in the street beside beat-up white Dodge.

Without a word they get in.  Hold as they get in, SAL starts

and they begin to drive out of the spot.

Close on DOYLE.

A series of impressionist traveling shots of the white Dodge

and DOYLE's Ford moving through Brooklyn Streets, picking up

street signs of areas.

Medium close shot of the white Dodge pulling into the curb.

In near background, a candy-confectionery store.

INT. DOYLE'S CAR - DAY

Close shot of DOYLE and RUSSO in profile driving past the

candy store as SAL and ANGIE open door and go in.

Close shot of DOYLE and RUSSO parked.  DOYLE is looking in

the rear-view mirror while BUDDY is turned around on the

seat, looking out the rear window.

A long shot, from the DOYLE-RUSSO viewpoint of the candy

store.  The door is open, the street is deserted.  Lights

are going on in the little shop.

Hold on the storefront as SAL appears, this time in a candy

store operator's smock over a white undershirt, baggy slacks.

He's carrying a stack of newspapers.  Zoom in on SAL stacking

the Sunday Times and the Daily News on the rack in front of

the store as ANGIE appears in the doorway.  She's blackhaired

now, the blonde wig gone, also wearing a grey cotton smock

over a plain skirt and sweater, holding a cup of coffee.  We

hold on them for a beat, then

DOYLE and RUSSO close just looking at each other.  The look

says everything about the freak case they have stumbled into.

DOYLE-RUSSO car B.G.

EXT. BROOKLYN STREET - DAY

A Brooklyn slum street on a morning in November.  It is

about 11 o'clock and relatively quiet.  A scattering of

tenement URCHINS give the street some sound and life.  There

are a couple of dark shops on the street and a bar, all

appearing to be closed.  We look down the street and pick up

DOYLE and RUSSO coming down it, walking very quickly.  They

are heading toward the bar.  A young man is coming out -

they grab him and throw him back.

INT. BAR ROOM - DAY

The Young Man is thrown in, followed by DOYLE and RUSSO.

There are about 20 or 30 PUETRO RICAN and BLACK MEN in the

joint, a couple of BLACK WOMEN.  They are in all manner of

dress.  Half of them are wearing shades.  The bar is noisy

with conversation, laughter and music.

DOYLE and RUSSO standing in the doorway, DOYLE slightly to

the left, RUSSO a little behind him.  DOYLE's arms are at

his sides.  RUSSO's right hand is crossed over his belt,

under his jacket and on the butt of his .38, ready, waiting

to back his partner's play or respond to any move within the

bar.

DOYLE moving into the bar alone.  He pulls the plug out of

the Juke Box, plunging the room to silence.

Twenty men raise hands to their heads as one.  The raggle-

taggle swarm plays a kind of human chicken, refusing to move

until the last moment then stepping out of his way.  One of

the customers doesn't.

DOYLE raises his left arm and pushes the MAN aside.  The

MAN's eyes go to RUSSO, off-camera at the door, and back to

DOYLE.  He doesn't resist; he gets in line with the rest of

them, a line formed about four or five feet from the bar,

running the length of it.

Close of DOYLE at the bar, holding an ashcan and skimming

the metal underrailing with one finger, knocking off the

magnetized key boxes into the ashcan.  He isn't even looking

at them.  His eyes are across the bar, staring down the

customers.

Close shot of the ashcan and the little metal boxes clinking

into it.

Close shot of DOYLE, the ashcan now on the bar, opening one

of the boxes, taking out the ten dollar bill, putting it on

the bar.

Then, opening another, taking out the glassine deck of

heroin.  Then another, containing a glassine deck.  He

empties the glassine envelopes on the bar into a cocktail

mixer which he proceeds to shake.  The shaker is half-filled

with tomato juice.

DOYLE leaning over the bar toward the glaring crowd, pours

the mixture into the ashcan.

He wiggles his finger.  It is a command for THREE MEN to

step forward.  The MEN do not move at first.

They move, shuffling, hesitatingly.  But they move -- TWO

BLACKS and A PUETRO RICAN.

Hands of the THREE MEN going into pockets.

Close of a miscellany of keys, coins, cigarettes going onto

the bar -- with two hypodermics, six or eight marijuana

cigarettes, a small plastic vial of barbiturates.

The three men turn and enter the individual phone booths.

They stand, waiting, like contestants in the $64 Question.

RUSSO is with another man from whom he's just taken a set of

works.

The man climbs up on the bar.

The man goes into a fast tap dance.  But he only gets in a

few steps --

RUSSO pulls the man off the bar, sends him into one of the

phone booths.

DOYLE coming down the front of the bar.  He stops before

another man, who has just come out of the toilet.

DOYLE frisks the man.  Comes up with vial of pills and two

roaches.

He collars the man and shoves him towards the toilet.

RUSSO, eyes moving everywhere, hand on the gun.

Inside the toilet of the bar.  The MAN is up against the

wall.  DOYLE is only inches away.

The MAN is an AGENT and this is the only way DOYLE can get

immediate information from him without destroying the man's

cover.  Their conversation is in whispers.  And very fast.

Door of toilet.  There is a hell of a crash and slamming

behind it.  Door opens and DOYLE steps out over the crumpled

prostrate form of the INFORMER.  He has just decked the man

to continue the protection of the cover.  He pauses halfway

down the line as if he's speculating on beating up another

one because he didn't get any information.  But he decides

that would be futile too.

EXT. PASSENGER SHIP - DAY

Close shot of DEVEREAUX, New York harbor in the background,

being interviewed by television reporters on his arrival in

the U.S. abroad a passenger ship.  He is smiling, jovial,

charming.

Medium close shot of DEVEREAUX and THREE TV REPORTERS, as

they talk, a crane moves into action behind them and lifts

out of hold.  LA VALLE is with DEVEREAUX as Translator and

Interpreter.

Overhead the Lincoln comes down from the hold of the ship.

EXT. WEST SIDE DRIVE - DAY

A long view of the pier from the opposite (east) side of

West Street, beneath the steel trusses and girders of the

West Side Drive and through the forest of cars that are

parked there, the jam of traffic that develops around every

unloading vessel.  It is a view that takes in the front end

of the Lincoln inching off the pier.  HENRI DEVEREAUX at the

wheel, turns to his right.  We watch until the point of view

on the sidewalk.  ALAIN CHARNIER and PIERRE NICOLI are

standing there watching.  When the car (off-camera) turns

east on the way to the garage, NICOLI glances to CHARNIER.

CHARNIER does not look back.

INT. MUTCHIE'S BAR - NIGHT

In Lower Manhattan.  There are SIX or EIGHT MATRONS still

there, stevedores and truck drivers.  Most of them are

clustered at the far end of the bar, where MUTCHIE, a gray-

haired gone-to-paunch Irishman with spectacles as thick as

pop-bottle bottoms stands behind the mahogany bar.  The

cluster of customers is involved in a typical New York

saloon argument.

DOYLE is ignoring the debate and watching the television.

He is approached by a small MAN in a long coat and baggy

suit with suspenders.  This is JESUS THE BOOSTER.

JESUS reaches into his trousers and pulls out three suits

(jackets and pants).  They are of the latest style and

color, and still on hangers!

DOYLE examines one of the jackets.

JESUS blends into the crowd and we pick up the dialogue of

MUTCHIE and his cronies, BAD EDDIE, LEE and PUGGY.

MUTCHIE pours him a straight Scotch in a shotglass.

TIME LAPSE.  The DRINKERS are gone.  MUTCHIE is at the bar

cleaning up.  DOYLE is in the open adjoining kitchen area

cooking breakfast.

DOYLE is red-eyed and in need of a shave.  He fidgets

through his pockets looking for a cigarette but doesn't find

one.  As he drives along a GIRL CYCLIST comes into view

alongside.

Our view is DOYLE's view of her long, lean tapered legs.  If

he looks further, and DOYLE always looks further, he will

see there is a bra-band sweater covering her well-formed

breasts.  The pendulous swing is there as she bends over the

handlebars.

nothing.  He hears a shower working inside the apartment.

No answer.

RUSSO reaches into his jacket pocket and gets a celluloid

card, his PBA card, which he slides into the door at the

lock.  He gives it a juggle and the lock is free but the

door moves grudgingly.

INT. DOYLE'S APARTMENT - DAY

The door to DOYLE's apartment, a close view from inside.

There's a bike propped against it and BUDDY RUSSO is trying

the room puzzled, exasperated.

INT. APARTMENT - RUSSO'S POV - DAY

DOYLE is anklecuffed to the bedpost at the foot of the bed.

The shower goes off.  RUSSO puts the bike upright on its

stand and squeezes the horn, which makes a loud beep.

The BIKE GIRL appears in the bathroom door, wrapped in a

towel.

RUSSO sees key on dresser - tosses it to DOYLE.  There are

clothes all over the place, the GIRL's cycling outfit,

DOYLE's pants and shoes and socks.  The decor is completely

impersonal.  RUSSO looks up.

RUSSO goes to chair.

RUSSO, who is half sitting on them, pulls the pants loose

and hands them to DOYLE.

RUSSO turns his head in anger.

No answer.

No answer.

DOYLE cuts into the next lane to a lot of horn-blowing and

comes to a dead, screeching stop.  DOYLE sits up sharply

erect in the seat, craning to see where SAL is going.  He

throws open the door and hurls himself out.

EXT. MADISON AVENUE - LATE DAY

SAL moving north on Madison Avenue.  He is walking in a

triangular trap of foot surveillance.  We begin to learn

this when we fall back twenty feet behind SAL and pick up

the figure of JIMMY DOYLE, moving at exactly the same pace.

While he keeps looking forward after SAL, he also looks

regularly to the left, across to the West side of Madison

where we quickly zoom in on the figure of BILL MULDERIG, who

is on an even line opposite SAL and moving almost precisely

in step with the subject of their surveillance.  MULDERIG

keeps an eye on SAL but is also glancing north ahead of SAL

to BUDDY RUSSO, who is 20 or 30 feet ahead of SAL, thus

forming the triangle of the A-B-C tail.

SAL bobbing along.

RUSSO looking quizzically, puzzled, from a doorway.

CHARNIER and NICOLI are engaged in a running conversation

that we cannot hear.  But what CHARNIER is saying is simply

that he wants to get a pack of cigarettes before they turn

back and stop for dinner.

RUSSO looking to DOYLE for a signal.

EXT. A CIGAR STORE - DAY

DOYLE already beginning to feel the cold, rubbing his hands

together, at the front of the place CHARNIER and NICOLI have

entered, trying to figure it out as CHARNIER and NICOLI

emerge, CHARNIER ripping the cellophane off a pack of

cigarettes, and they turn back in DOYLE's direction.

DOYLE, face to face with CHARNIER and NICOLI.  Straining to

hear, he picks up a few words of French.  Without losing

stride he steps off the curb and cuts across the street,

moving south, away from them, as they come north.  But

halfway across the street, we pick up RUSSO coming in his

direction, sharp enough to pick up the tail where DOYLE had

to drop it.

Medium close shot of DOYLE standing in another doorway, this

one in Madison Avenue, opposite and a little up the street

from the Westbury.  It is about 2 o'clock in the morning and

there's not much traffic.  DOYLE looks like a man almost too

tired to stand.  We hear a car pull up (off camera).

INT. RUSSO'S CAR - NIGHT

View from the front seat of a sedan of DOYLE falling into

the corner of the back seat.  RUSSO reaches across the seat

from the camera to hand DOYLE a brown paper container of

with it.  RUSSO hands over another gift, a pint of Canadian

Club.  DOYLE takes a big swig.

INT. WEINSTOCK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Close shot of CHEMIST with a small lab layout spread in

front of him -- burner, test tubes, etc.  The MAN's wearing

an ordinary business suit and both the table and the

background indicate that this is not a lab, but somebody's

library or den -- and a fashionable one, with photos, a

signed picture of Lyndon Johnson, etc., on the panelled walls.

The CHEMIST is running a Thiele test on a small mound of

powder.  Heroin from CHARNIER's shipment.

Medium close shot of JOEL WEINSTOCK and SAL BOCA sitting

opposite the CHEMIST.

SAL has a glass of beer in front of him, WEINSTOCK a brandy

snifter containing a splash of amber cognac.  Both are

interested; SAL quite nervously.

The CHEMIST immerses a capillary tube, a tiny instrument the

size of a needle into an open kilo of heroin.

He pours a small quantity of mineral oil into a burnmeister

test tube and preheats the oil over the open flame of a tiny

alcohol lamp.

He removes a 15-in thermometer from its leather case,

fastens the capillary tuve (now totally immersed in the

heroin) to the bulb of the thermometer with a rubber band.

He places the bulb, with capillary attached, into an open

rubber stop and inserts the entire apparatus into the

burnmeister tube, about three inches in.

With a small metal clamp he holds the rig over the lamp.

We watch closely with the CHEMIST, WEINSTOCK and BOCA as the

white heroin powder slowly, agonizingly dissolves into the

mineral oil and

The mercury rises slowly up the thermometer to 220 - 230.

The faces of the three men are filled with wonder and

anxiety.  As the mercury continues to rise they become a

cheering section, rooting the hometeam home.

The longer it takes for the powder to dissolve, the purer

the heroin.  The mercury stops at 240!

Close on WEINSTOCK, relaxed, smoking a large cigar.

of the Hooker's tail.  He straightens it as much as possible

and throws it under the driver's seat.

EXT. MADISON AVENUE - DAY

Medium shot of DOYLE on foot popeyeing up Madison Avenue in

the vicinity of the Westbury.  As unobtrusively as possible,

he's looking for the tail that should be there covering

CHARNIER.  DOYLE is on the East side of the street, and the

Westbury is on the West.  He pokes his head into a couple of

doorways, checks the cars parked at the curb, looks up to a

couple of the mezzanine shops along the street.  He sees

PHIL KLEIN and ANOTHER AGENT talking together totally

oblivious to the front entrance.  MULDERIG in a cigar store

looks to his wristwatch, then goes inside the store.

Close shot of DOYLE frowning, puzzled.  There doesn't seem

to be anybody alert.  He looks over to the hotel.

being raised at the last moment by an off-camera hand

and a car with which it apparently collided.  The scene is

lighted with flares.  Police rescue WORKERS and FIREMEN are

scrambling up and down the face of the cliff.  They are

carrying BODIES out of the bus and the car, COPS pulling

them out through the windows, leading them on stretchers.

There are shouted orders and some moans and cries from the

wreckage.  In the foreground is LT. WALTER SIMONSON, involved

in the operation, but also involved in a hassle with DOYLE,

MULDERIG and RUSSO who are standing with him.  An officer

can see the Lincoln.  The lights of a car appear on the left

and come down the street past the Lincoln, slowly, like a

man looking for a place to park.  We can make out, but just

barely with the help of the street lights, four people in

the car.

DOYLE in close profile, the foreground, picking up a corner

of the Lincoln in the background.  While we are looking in

come.

including DOYLE's flash on and form a spotlight on the

Lincoln and the figures around it.  Frozen in the headlights,

confused, startled, and disbelieving are FIVE PUERTO RICANS

with a variety of auto-stripping tools in their hands: lug

wrenches, tire irons, pinch bars, monkey wrenches, etc.

car with him and runs toward the men.  We hear voices

shouting.
