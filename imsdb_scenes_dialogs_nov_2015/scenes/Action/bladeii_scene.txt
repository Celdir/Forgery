EXT. COMMUNITY BLOOD BANK - NIGHT

PULL BACK from a neon red cross ablaze in the cold December

night to REVEAL an inner-city, store-front clinic.  Trash and

leaves blow over wet, snowy pavement.

ANGLE ON a PALE FIGURE standing across the street.  He looks

feverish and strung-out, in serious need of a fix.  This is

JARED NOMAK, 20s.  He starts towards the clinic.

INT. COMMUNITY BLOOD BANK - ENTRANCE - NIGHT

Potential DONORS sit in a waiting area, filling out forms,

leafing through informational material.  A sign in the window

reads: "Se habla Espanol".  Others read: "YOU ARE MAKING A

DIFFERENCE", "GIVE LIFE", and "BECOME A PLATELET DONOR".  We

overhear a bored-looking EMPLOYEE behind the information desk

quizzing someone over the phone:

We MOVE PAST the employee to Nomak, waiting.

Nomak looks up.  We get a better look at his face now - he

has a thin scar running from his lower lip down his chin.  A

childhood accident, perhaps.  A NURSE smiles and motions for

him to join her.  She's carrying a clipboard.

INT. COMMUNITY BLOOD BANK - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Nomak follows the Nurse into a dimly-lit hallway.  We track

their progress in a convex safety mirror suspended from the

hallway ceiling as they pass all manner of medical supplies --

centrifuges, an apheresis device, etc.

Nomak follows the Nurse to a steel door were TWO SECURITY

GUARDS await them.  Both look bored, paying little attention

to the monitor which offers a view of the examining room

beyond.  There is also a small window with safety glass.

GUARD #1 opens the door, following Nomak and the Nurse

inside.  GUARD #2 remains behind, manning the hallway.

INT. COMMUNITY BLOOD BANK - EXAMINING ROOM - NIGHT

The Nurse ushers Nomak into the room, indicating he should

sit in a kind of reclining dental chair with arm and

headrests.  Nomak notices a security camera mounted above.

Beat.  The Nurse sets aside Nomak's file, looking

uncomfortable.

A kind-faced DOCTOR enters, nodding to Guard #1.

The Doctor and Nurse smile, BARING FANGS.  We realize now

that they are both vampires.  The Guard, too.  He grips Nomak

by the throat, forcing him back into the restraint chair.  As

the vampire Guard does so, his hand brushes against Nomak's

jaw.  The flesh on Nomak's chin briefly separates along the

scar - almost as if it were a seam.

The guard pauses - and Nomak LAUGHS.  Definitely NOT the

reaction the vampires were expecting from a potential victim.

Nomak starts to shake and twitch, like he's going into some

kind of seizure.  The whites of his eyes bleed red.  He

throws his head back, opening his mouth as a PAIR OF RAZOR

SHARP CANINES extrude from his gums.  These are longer, much

more lethal-looking than the fangs of the vampires and --

Nomak lashes out, knocking the Guard backwards.  The Nurse

SCREAMS.  Nomak clamps his mouth onto her throat, SLAMMING

her back against the wall.

The vampire Doctor rushes to the door, scrambling to unbolt

it.  Nomak reaches for him, HOWLING with blood-drunk laughter

as he lifts the Doctor up.  Nomak flings the Doctor about

like a toy, using his body to SMASH the lights, then the

security camera above.

INT. COMMUNITY BLOOD BANK - HALLWAY - NIGHT

We hear SCREAMS and HORRIBLE NOISES coming from the examining

room.  Guard #2 draws a gun and looks to the security monitor

with alarm.  The screen goes black.  He looks to the small

window, trying to peer into the now-darkened room beyond --

SPLASH!  A wave of blood smears across a window.  A HAND

wipes a patch of blood away, revealing Nomak's baleful,

distorted eyes.  Guard #2 starts to back away when --

BANG!  Nomak slams against the other side of the steel door.

BANG!BANG!BANG!  The door begins to bend, hand-shaped

impressions bulging outward as Nomak starts to peel the door

apart like it was an aluminum can.

Guard #2 has seen enough.  He turns and runs even as the door

CAVES INWARD off its hinges.  Forward momentum sends the door

sliding across the hallway floor where it trips up the Guard.

ON THE DOORWAY

as Nomak steps into the hallway.  Because of the lights

above, there are alternating pools of light and shadow in the

hall.  Nomak advances towards us, his face coming in and out

of darkness.

With each pool of light, his awful smile seems to distort

further and further, until his mouth seems to be widening all

the way back to his ears.

On the floor, the vampire Guard CRIES OUT in fear, helplessly

raising his hands to defend himself.  Nomak HOWLS and leaps

towards him/us, blacking out the screen with his hurtling

form as we --

EXT. INNER-CITY BACK-ALLEY - NIGHT

BOOM!  A second-story door flies open and FIVE VAMPIRE thug

wannabes come spilling out.  They race down a flight of

stairs, tripping and tumbling over themselves.  In descending

order, they are: RUSH, a pimped-out Vanilla Ice clone wearing

Karl Kani gear, followed by JIGSAW, ST. CLOUD, T-BAG and

SEGURA.

BLADE

exits just behind them, eschewing the stairs completely and

vaulting over the railing.  He unholsters his MACH pistol as

he drops, FIRING it as he lands in a cat-like stance on the

snowy ground below --

BA-BANG!  A silver-tipped bullet punches through T-Bag's

chest.  He turns to ash even as his fellow vamps dash through

the disintegrating cloud that used to be his body.  The

embers melt the snow where they land.

A super-charged foot chase ensues, with hunter and prey

moving at speeds in excess of anything a human would ever be

capable of.  We're talking thirty-five, even forty miles an

hour.

ON BLADE

Running like a bull, condensed vapor streaming from his mouth

and nostrils.  Splashing through puddles of icy water

storming through barriers of plywood and razor wire, leaping

over mountains of garbage bags.

ON THE VAMPIRES

as they flatten a length of cyclone fencing like it was crepe

paper.  They scramble up an obstacle of waste bins, leaping

into the air --

BACK TO BLADE

pulling out his twin-bladed boomerang as he runs.  He flings

the weapon.  It twirls around, catching --

ST. CLOUD IN MID-LEAP

and cutting the vampire completely in half.  As the

disintegrating halves of St. Cloud fall to the side, Blade

storms over the waste bin.

EXT. INNER-CITY - SECOND ALLEY - NIGHT

The remaining vampires stumble into a narrower alley where a

GROUP OF BUMS are warming themselves over a series of oil

drum fires.

Jigsaw slips, TRIPPING over one of the burning oil drums,

catching himself ablaze.  He doesn't give a shit.  He keeps

on running, barreling his way into --

INT. NOODLE FACTORY - NIGHT

-- the back entrance of a cramped, sweat-shop.  Some kind of

noodle factory filled with steam and equipment and YAMMERING

FOREIGNERS and --

-- here comes Blade, hot on the vampires' heels, shouldering

workers aside and --

EXT. NOODLE FACTORY - NIGHT

-- Rush and the remaining vamps spill out onto the street

where a number of motorcycles are waiting for them -- two BMW

R1200 motorbikes and a tricked-out Panhead Harley chopper

with ape-hanger handlebars.

Rush and Segura leap atop their BMWs.  Jigsaw rolls into a

puddle of water, dousing himself, then jumps onto his

chopper.  As the vamps peel out --

BLADE

Bursts from the factory.  Segura revs his BMW, trying to run

him down.  At the last second, Blade pivots aside like a

matador.  Segura circles around for another try.

Blade leaps, somersaulting through the air, then lands on the

back of the bike behind Segura.  SHINGGG!  Blade pulls a

retractable garrotte wire from the sleeve of his jacket and

wraps it around Segura's throat.

With a violent twist, Blade decapitates Segura.  As the

vampire's headless body turns to ash before him, Blade leans

forward and takes the controls of the speeding motorcycle.

WHOOSH!  Blade speeds after the other vamps.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Rush and Jigsaw gun their bikes for all they're worth.  Up

ahead, a line of construction barricades are blocking the

way.  The vampires power on through the barricades, then

abruptly brake --

THE OVERPASS

before them is under construction.  There's a twenty-foot gap

in the road where a portion is missing, pieces of re-bar

poking out from the ends of the prefabricated sections.

Rush and Jigsaw consider their options, but then they hear

the ROAR of Blade's engine as he comes SCREAMING over the

rise in the road!

Fuck it.  Rush powers his chopper forward, making the jump,

burning rubber as he lands on the far side.  Jigsaw torques

his handle and follows, rocketing towards the gap.

ON BLADE

as he snaps his hand up -- a trio of Japanese throwing stars

appearing between his fingers like a magician's cards.  He

flings the stars at Jigsaw's bike --

The throwing stars hit Jigsaw's back tire and the bike goes

down, vomiting SPARKS as it slides forward.  Jigsaw is flung

forward like a ragdoll, out over the gap in the overpass and

-- WHUNK!  Jigsaw is impaled on the protruding re-bar!  He

HOWLS, instantly disintegrating as Blade makes the jump!

UP AHEAD

Rush cuts onto an on-ramp, powering his way onto the freeway.

EXT. FREEWAY - NIGHT

Hyper-speed.  Rush slouches low, trying to cut wind

resistance and will his bike faster.  He hazards a look back.

BLADE

is gaining on him like demon of speed.

Rush pulls a TEC-9, FIRING back at Blade.  It's no good.

Blade is nearly upon him, unsheathing his sword from his back

scabbard --

Blade JABS his sword forward into Rush's rear-wheel.  The

bike locks up, flips over, BURSTS INTO FLAMES.  The whole

screaming wreck slews forward, SHOWERING SPARKS --

RUSH

goes flying onto the road, rolling over and over, one of his

legs SNAPPING at a bone-breaking angle.  As he lies there

MOANING, Blade circles around, sweeping past Rush's decimated

bike, retrieving his sward from the burning wreckage.

Blade kills the engine on his own bike and dismounts.  Rush

is pathetically trying to drag his broken body to safety.

Blade approaches, placing his boot heel on the back of Rush's

neck, forcing his face against the asphalt.  He unholsters

his MACH, pointing it at the vampire's bleeding head.

Blade's opening line:

EXT. MOO-COW CREAMERY - MILK FACTORY - NIGHT

CLOSE ON a peeling wall mural -- smiling 30s cartoon cow

winking at us, licking her chops.  The logo reads: "TASTY".

Blade's matte-black Charger RUMBLES into view and parks in

front of the abandoned milk factory.  Blade steps out,

heaving an equipment sack onto his shoulder.

INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT

THREE LACONIC VAMPIRE TOUGHS are playing poker at a card

table, dealing out novelty nudie cards.  We hear a NOISE.

One of the vampires approaches a reinforced door.  He slides

open a viewing slot and peers through.  Nobody outside.  The

vampire turns back to his poker buddies, shrugging --

Before the vampire can even finish his sentence, Blade's

SWORD punches straight through the door into his chest.  He

gasps and turns to ash as the sword disengages back out

through the door and --

CRASH!  The door explodes open, sending clouds of burning

vampire embers every which way.  In walks Blade, grinning

wickedly, MACH ready --

As the other two vampires rise - POW!  A silver hollow-point

hits the first one in the neck.  POW!  Another hollow-point

takes out the second.  The vampires drop, turning to ash.

Blade holsters his MACH, striding through vampire ash piles.

The place is eerily quiet here, in stark contrast to the

mayhem of the last few minutes.  Just the steady, low-pitched

HUM of machinery.

Blade starts forward.  Up ahead, a FAINT GLOW is emitting

from behind an area that's been sectioned off with canvas

tarps.  Blade sweeps one of the tarps aside --

THREE LARGE TANKS

are hidden inside.  The first two are empty.  A MAN is

suspended within the third, bobbing weightlessly in a sea of

red plasma.  His long, gray hair floats about his face,

shrouding his weathered features.  We're not sure if he's

sleeping or dead.

Whistler's ace drifts around into view.  Blade shakes his

head in sadness.  He looks about for a way to extract

Whistler, doesn't see any obvious means, then --

CRASH!  Blade kicks through the glass.  Blood and fluids

flood out around him as Whistler's limp body tumbles partly

down, but he's still suspended by the wires and medical

leads.  Blade unsheathes his sword, severing the wires --

Whistler falls into his arms.  Blade cradles him, then -- the

gunsmith's eyes abruptly snap open, flooding with rage.

Blade staggers back as the HOWLING horror that used to be his

mentor wraps his hands around Blade's throat, forcing him to

the ground.  Whistler ROARS, revealing a set of jagged fangs.

Whistler SLAMS the back of Blade's head against the concrete

floor again and again, punctuating his words with each SLAM --

Blade knees Whistler in the balls.  Whistler lets go, cupping

his groin as Blade heaves him aside.

Blade strips off his gauntlets.  Whistler springs at him

again.  Blade sinks his fist deep in Whistler's stomach.  As

Whistler doubles over, Blade twists Whistler's hands behind

his back, cuffing his wrists together with a pair of titanium

manacles.

Blade pulls a restraint hood from his equipment bag and

quickly slips it over Whistler's head, cinching it tight.

Another beat.  Whistler doesn't stir.  He's down for the

count.  Blade pauses a moment, catching his breath as he

leans on Whistler's still form.  He's exhausted.

He rises, heaving Whistler's body over his shoulder.

EXT. THE CITY - NIGHT

Blade's battered Charger knifes through the snow-dusted urban

blight like a shadow.  Boarded up businesses, tent cities,

doorways bombed with graffiti throwups -- wherever this

godforsaken Gomorrah is, it's definitely a notch down on the

misery scale from the city Blade used to call home.

Up ahead, the sprawl levels out, giving way to an ice-bound

harbor wreathed in fog.

INT. BLADE'S CHARGER - NIGHT

Blade drives on, inured to the sqaulor.  He made peace with

the darkness a long time ago.

EXT. SHIPYARD - NIGHT

The Charger weaves its way through a maze of scrap metal and

rusty shipping containers, homing in on a sprawling warehouse

that's been cordoned off by cyclone fencing and razor wire.

Utlra-violent floodlights illuminate the area, while security

cameras keep a watchful eye.

INT. WAREHOUSE - INDUSTRIAL ELEVATOR - NIGHT

More UV lights flicker on.  We're in a massive loading

elevator/platform which HUMS as it ascends, eventually

reaching its destination with a BOOMING CLANG.  The doors at

the rear glide open.  Blade guides the Charger out.

INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

Santa's workshop by way of Soldier of Fortune.  Industrial

equipment is strewn everywhere.  Mills, old furnaces, gutted

vehicles, an ad hoc surgical theater.  We also notice the big

rig which Scud had been piloting.  Because of various leaking

overhead pipes, the floor is slick with a sheen of water.

Blade kills his Charger, looking around as he climbs out.

Blade's voice ECHOES throughout the cavernous room.

ANGLE ON SCUD

A handlebar moustached, weed-sucking stoner.  Thrift-store

chic, wearing a Jimmy Walker "Dyn-O-Mite!" T-shirt.

Scud is lowering himself down from the ceiling on a rope and

pulley system where he'd been suspended in a safety harness,

doing some kind of electrical wiring job.  He reaches the

floor and unclips himself.  We notice he's wearing a surfer's

charm around his neck that's been strung with vampire fangs.

Scud pulls a half-smoked roach from behind his ear, using a

lighter in the shape of a woman's torso to fire up.  The

flame jets from a hole in one of her tits.  He takes a

Spicoli-sized hit and offers the roach to Blade.

Blade slaps it from his hand.

Blade opens the trunk.  Scud joins him.

WHISTLER

is inside.  Blade unfastens the hood, slipping it off.

Immediately, Whistler sits up, LUNGING at Blade!

Blade gets Whistler in a headlock, choking him as he drags

him out of the trunk.  It's like trying to wrestle a rabid

pit bull.  He looks to Scud, annoyed.

Scud steps forward, tentative.  Together, he and Blade drag

Whistler kicking and SCREAMING across the workshop, forcing

him into a small, cell-like room.

INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - CELL - NIGHT

WHAP!  Blade throws Whistler onto the concrete floor, pinning

him as Scud quickly slips a series of chains around him which

have been secured to the wall.  The opposite wall is covered

by a series of steel shutters.  As Whistler continues to

thrash, Blade affixes a muzzle to the older man's mouth.

Blade pulls out a pneumatic syringe, plunging an ampoule of

amber-colored fluid into the bottle mount.

Blade injects Whistler with the syringe.  Whistler HOWLS in

pain, nearly throwing Blade and Scud off him.

Scud scurries away.  Whistler's struggles have taken an even

more violent turn.  Blade beats him back down.

Finally, Blade steps on Whistler's neck, pinning his head as

he draws a shotgun from a holster beneath his armpit.  He

shoves it in Whistler's SNARLING FACE.

Blade raises his foot from Whistler's neck, quickly backing

out the door.  Whistler THROWS himself at Blade, nearly

tearing the chains from the wall as --

INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

BOOM!  Blade slams the cell door closed.  The door is heavy

steel.  Nevertheless, Whistler kicks against it, threatening

to tear it off its hinges.  Blade throws a heavy cross-bar

over the door.  Then he steps back, joining Scud.

WHUMP!WHUMP!WHUMP!  Whistler hammers the door again and again

and again.  But the crossbar holds.  Blade glances at Scud,

who's looking winded and shaken by the ordeal.

Scud nods and exits.  Blade drags a chair across the floor,

setting it in front of the door.  He sits down, shotgun

resting across his knees, holding vigil.  And off that grim,

stoic image we --

EXT. CITY DUMP - DAY (20 YEARS AGO)

Daylight bleaches the image, almost whiting it out.  A WINO

sifts through refuse, collecting bottles.  Three MUTTS are

tethered to his side with rope.  He reaches for a bottle,

cuts himself on a piece of glass.  As he inspects his wound,

his dogs GROWL.  The Wino looks up --

A BLACK KID (14) is standing atop a mountain of refuse --

wiry and intense, perched there like a predator.  The Wino

glances at his wrist again, the blood, then back up at the

black kid.  Unnerved, the Wino starts to back away, then

turns -- BUMPING right into the black kid, who has moved

beside him with uncanny speed.  (NOTE: this all happens

within a single, continuous shot.)

The boy SLAMS the Wino against the trestle wall and SNARLS,

baring FANGS.  And just as he's about to tear the man's

throat out --

A HAND reaches in from off-screen, pulling the boy back.

It's WHISTLER, twenty years younger and spryer, with a head

full of RAVEN BLACK hair.

Whistler throws the boy into the light, forcing him onto the

ground.  He shoves a .45 against the boy's face and is just

about to pull the trigger when he stops, NOTICING overhead

sun reflected in the boy's eyes.  Whistler looks up and SEES

the sun at high noon, then glances back at the boy in

understanding.  He smiles.

INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - DAWN

Blade wakes up, lifts his head.  A shaft of sunlight shines

directly down onto him, reflecting back at us from his now

adult eyes.  Blade hasn't moved.  He sits in the chair in

front of the cell door which is now silent.  He stands,

unlocking the cell door.  He heaves the cross-bar away.  The

door GROANS as he opens it.

INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - CELL - DAWN

Blade enters.  It's dark.  We can just make out Whistler's

figure huddled in the corner like some kind of caged animal,

his lanky, gray hair obscuring his face.

Whistler doesn't stir.  Blade crosses over to the steel

shutters.  For the briefest moments, he hesitates.  Then he

hits the switch, readying his shotgun.  With a HUM, the

shutters rise, throwing a SHAFT OF BLINDING SUNLIGHT over

Whistler.

Nothing happens.  Blade lowers his shotgun.  Whistler slowly

raises his head, fixing Blade with a bloodshot eye.

INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - BATHROOM AREA - LATER

Whistler stands bare-chested before a corroded mirror,

splashing water from a sink over his face, rinsing off

shaving cream residue.  He inspects his features -- he's

cleaned himself up a bit, trimmed his beard, etc.

He pulls on a fresh shirt, then turns to face Blade, who

stands behind him.

Blade smiles.  That was as close to a thank-you as this old

junkyard dog is ever going to give.

INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - BACKSTORAGE AREA - DAY

Whistler has fired up a Lucky Strike.  He's moving through

the storage area where much of his old equipment has been

shelved, pulling tarps off, checking things.  Blade follows.

Whistler takes a long drag, expelling the smoke slowly,

studying the cigarette in his hand.

Blade nods.  Then Whistler stops, obviously frustrated.

Just then we hear the SOUND of an industrial lathe firing up.

Curious, Whistler exits into --

INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - DAY

The workshop proper.  Scud is working at Whistler's old

lathe, bopping his head along to MUSIC which is playing on a

nearby TV.  The them song to SPEED RACER.  Now he's wearing a

Ron Jeremy T-shirt that says "Daddy".

Whistler cocks an incredulous eyebrow at Blade, who has

fallen in beside him.  Scud kills the lathe and approaches.

Scud offers his hand.  Whistler doesn't take it.  Scud shoots

an uneasy glance at Blade, raising an eyebrow in question.

Is Whistler okay, or not?  Blade nods.  Whistler moves over

to the Charger which has its hood up.

Whistler just looks to Blade and shakes his head.

Whistler gets in Scud's face.  Scud looks to Blade for help,

but he just watches, letting the two of them sort things out.

Scud attempts to show some balls, but stammers all the same.

Just then, however, an alarm starts BEEPING.  Scud checks a

display as Blade readies his MACH.

Scud checks a series of thermal signature displays.

Scud looks to a bank of security monitors -- the views break

into static as a FIGURE rushes past them.  He tries a few

keyboard commands.

Whistler makes a few adjustments on the nearest monitor.

Whistler moves to a rack of weaponry.  As he reaches for CAR

15, Scud moves to stop him.

Whistler SMACKS Scud in the face with the butt of the CAR-15

and pushes past him.  We hear a CRASH.

ANGLE ON

TWO BLACK, LATEX-CLAD, NINJA LIKE INTRUDERS

Running on all fours, racing upside down across the ceiling

at break-neck speed.  Then they drop, somersaulting down

fifty feet, landing in a cat-like stance.

Scud, with his nose now bleeding, activates a series of

stadium-style lights secured to the ceiling.  The entire

place goes white with UV light, the image nearly blowing out.

CLOSE ON FIGURES' FACES

They are wearing metal goggles with iris shut to mere pin

prick openings.

Whistler trains the CAR-15 on --

THE FIRST LATEX CLAD FIGURE

Who is now removing something from a satchel.  Whistler

FIRES.  The Intruder drops the object and cartwheels away.

In the blink of an eye, the Second Intruder has launched

himself at Whistler, hand-springing off the floor, then

kicking him in the mid-section.  As Whistler falls back, the

Second Intruder presses forward.

ON BLADE

Unsheathing his sword, rushing at the First Intruder.

WHAP!  The Intruder traps Blade's forearm, pivoting, planting

a boot in Blade's ribcage.  Obviously, the Intruder is a

serious martial arts student.

WHAP!WHAP!WHAP!  The two of them go at it, unleashing a

flurry of kicks, blocks, and punches.  The Intruder gets

Blade in a back-choke.  He twists out of it, throwing the

Intruder over his shoulder, who neatly cartwheels, springing

back off the wall at Blade again --

Blade ducks beneath one of the Intruder's kicks, then traps

the Intruder's foot, giving it a savage twist.  CRACK!  Blade

backhands the intruder with a blow so strong that it knocks

the Intruder to his knees.  Then the Intruder reaches for a

short sword.  In a heartbeat, the sword is out and against

Blade's throat.  Just as Blade's sword is not against the

Intruder's.  It's a stalemate.

Blade and the First Intruder freeze.  The Second Intruder

steps away from Whistler, whom he clearly had the drop on,

and tosses the CAR-15 to the ground.

Blade looks back to the First Intruder.  Then slowly

withdraws his sword.  The Intruder does the same.  Blade

turns off the God-lights.  The UVs fade and normal lighting

returns.  Scud and Whistler pick themselves up off the floor.

The Intruders remove their masks.  The first is ASAD, a

cautious Sufi Muslim possessing a restrained nobility.

The second is a woman, NYSSA.  20-something, with emerald

eyes and strong, darkly exotic features.  Both are Vampire.

Blade holds up his hand, silencing Scud's outburst.  He nods

for Nyssa and Asad to continue.

Nyssa slowly crouches and reaches for the object she dropped

- a CD.  She tosses it to Blade.  Still keeping an eye on

them, Blade slips the CD into a reader.  We SEE a slide-show

of video capture shots taken from a surveillance camera.

Nomak tearing into the blood bank staff, etc.

CLOSE ON

The final still.  A blurry, horrific shot of Nomak's half

turned face and back.  We get a sense of distorted, inhuman

physiognomy.

EXT. BLADE AND SCUD'S WAREHOUSE - ROOFTOP - NIGHT

Blade, Whistler, and Scud stand near the ledge, while Asad

stands a few yards off, talking on a phone.  Nyssa stands

even further away, watching them with distrust.

Asad finishes his call and approaches them.

As if on cue, we hear the THRUM of helicopters.  Seconds

later, two Bell Jet Rangers appear above them, illuminating

them in their searchlight.

EXT. SKY - NIGHT

We track the helicopters across the night sky.  We SEE

Whistler and Asad in one, Blade, Scud and Nyssa in another.

INT. JET RANGER - NIGHT

Blade and Nyssa sit in the rear of the first helicopter.

Nyssa is studying Blade.

Blade smiles and opens his coat, gesturing to a bandolier of

plastic explosives secured to his chest.

The helicopter abruptly banks right, dropping down low.

EXT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT

The Bell Jet Rangers touch down outside a terraced, Frank

Lloyd Wright structure overlooking the ocean.  As Nyssa and

Asad lead Blade, Whistler and Scud towards the facility we

SEE a circular crimson logo encircling a double-helix.

Scud notices a series of RED LIGHT DOTS on his arms and

chest.  He looks up to see DOZENS OF VAMPIRE MARKSMEN on the

roofs above, training their weapons on them.

INT. ELEVATOR CAB - NIGHT

The group rides down.  The elevator stops.  The doors open.

INT. DAMASKINO'S STRONGHOLD - 4-WAY INTERSECTION - NIGHT

Nyssa and Asad lead them into a hub out of which multiple

corridors project.  They take the central corridor.

INT. STEEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT

The corridor ends at a pair of steel security doors.  Nyssa

stands before a biometric scanner, allowing a beam of light

to play over her face.  The scanner acknowledges her identity

and the doors HISS open, revealing a series of security doors

beyond these which successively open into --

A FINAL DOOR

Oak, set into a stainless steel wall.  Incalculably ancient,

elaborately carved.  Brought over from the "Old World."

As they move towards the final door, Whistler shivers.  Scud

watches as his breath escapes from his mouth in a frosty

plume.  Asad takes notice.

He pushes the doors open into --

INT. DAMASKINO'S LAIR - NIGHT

A crescent-shaped room filled with antiquities: quarry

columns from Middle Kingdom Egypt, stacks of arcane volumes,

Medieval frontispieces.  A Borgia-esque Renaissance portrait

staring down at us with a severe gaze.  Towering over all of

these is a massive Greek Cross carved from stone.  MUSIC

echoes around them -- Boito's Faust.  Standing in the midst

of this is OVERLORD ELI DAMASKINOS, wearing a robe of black

silk.

Damaskinos holds up his hand.  He waits for the music to

crescendo, then turns, his face still hidden in shadow.

Damaskinos draws closer now, stepping into the light.  Bright

eyed with smile like moonlight gleaming off a knife blade.

His skin is impossibly pale, almost marble-like, with

traceries of blue blood pulsing underneath.

Whistler glares at Damaskinos.  The two men stare at each

other a moment, sizing one another up.

CARTER STEVENS, an officious-looking familiar who has been

quietly watching from the wings now steps forward.

As Blade and Stevens shake, Blade notices a vampire glyph

poking out from beneath the familiar's shirt cuff.

Blade and the others turn to Nyssa, who uses a complex

mechanical key to activate a holo-projector mounted above the

table.  As she focuses the image, a 3-D DIORAMA of vampire

viral nucleocapsids swirls into view.  The nucelocapsids

begin attacking human red blood cells.

As Nyssa talks, one of the viral nucleocapsids changes,

mutating from its original, elegant design into a harsher,

more menacing form.

The mutated nucleocapsid begins feeding on the original

vampire capsids, causing a chain-reaction of mutation.  In

seconds, the holo-image is filled with throbbing, microscopic

horrors which then mutate into  --

A rotating 3-D image of Jared Nomak's face.  Eyes red, his

skin in full "blood mode" blush.

Blade turns to Damaskinos.

INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - DAWN

Blade, Whistler and Scud enter through the loading elevator.

Blade turns to Whistler.

Whistler moves away.  Blade shrugs off his jacket, begins

putting away his weapons.  Scud lingers, apprehensive.

Scud follows Blade's gaze, watching Whistler, who has

collapsed into a chair at the far end of the workshop.  The

grizzled hunter pulls off his leg brace, then massages his

bum knee.  Scud nods in Whistler's direction.

BACK ON WHISTLER

Surrounded by the salvaged parts and massive gears of long

discarded machinery, half-hidden in shadow.  A shaft of

morning sunlight cuts in through one of the windows, slowly

moving across the floor towards his position.  He shifts in

his chair, moving slightly --

Away from the light.

EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

It's late.  An ice-encased streetlight HUMS and flickers.

The pumps are vacant.  A heavy blanket of sooty snow covers

the grounds of the station.  The fluorescents of the mini

mart are the only beacon of light in an otherwise fog-bound

night.

INT. MINI-MART - NIGHT

A KOREAN WOMAN (30s) mans the counter.  Her TODDLER sits in a

circular safety walker nearby.  The kind that rolls and is

affixed with toys to keep a baby occupied.  The woman glances

at two surveillance monitors.  On the first monitor we see --

A CAR

pull up to the pumps outside.  A MAN gets out, slides his

credit card through the reader, starts pumping gas.

ON THE SECOND MONITOR

We SEE a FIGURE standing at the back by the Slurpee machine.

The figure turns, approaching.  It's Nomak.  He sets a

package of gum on the counter, looks to the baby.  He smiles,

wriggles his finger.  The child COOS and smiles back.

Unnerved by Nomak, the Korean woman quickly rings the

transaction, gives him his change.  He removes a stick of gum

from the pack, carefully unwraps it, slides it into his

mouth, watching the child all the while.  Finally, he nods to

the woman and leaves.  The door CHIMES as he exits.

Beat.  The woman looks to the surveillance monitors again.

THE FIRST MONITOR

The car is still there, but the man pumping gas is gone.

Puzzled, the woman steps from behind the counter and moves to

the glass doors, looking out --

HER POV

The car's driver side door hangs open.  Even more disturbing,

the hose for the gas pump lies untended on the icy ground,

spilling fuel from its nozzle.

EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

The Korean woman cautiously exits the mini-mart.  No one is

in sight.  She hurries to the abandoned car, disengaging the

lock on the pump handle, then setting it back in its cradle.

She looks to the open driver's door.  A FEW DROPLETS OF BLOOD

have stained the snow just outside it.  Then she sees --

A GHOSTLY FIGURE

Standing off in the fog-bound shadows.  The woman looks back

to the mini-mart, then back again to where the figure was

standing.  But the figure is gone!  Growing increasingly

anxious, the woman hurries back.

INT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

The woman shuts the door, locks it.  But she's still just a

target standing inside a well-lit glass box.  She moves to

the safety walker, scoops up her child.

After another moment's indecision, she slides the accordion

style gate down over the doors and windows.  Then she turns

off the lights.  Feeling somewhat more secure, the woman

moves back around the counter and SEES --

An unwrapped stick of gum resting on the tray of the baby

walker.  It wasn't there before.  With a rising sense of

dread, the woman backs away, bumping right into --

NOMAK

He smiles cruelly, the scar/seam in his chin just beginning

to part.  The woman gasps, turns to run --

and bumps into THREE MORE REAPERS.  Gaunt and feral-looking.

All three with shaved heads.

No eyebrows, and hairline scar/seams running down their

chins.  As one, the reapers descend on her.  We hear the

child's TERRIFIED WAIL and we --

EXT. THE CITY - NIGHT

A sulfur-colored moon shines its baleful light down upon the

icy cityscape as NOMAK'S ROAR echoes through the canyon of

buildings.

INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - BLADE'S SLEEPING AREA - NIGHT

Blade is just finishing injecting himself with serum.  He

sighs, falling back into the chair he's sitting in, waiting

for the shakes to subside.  He unwraps a piece of rubbing

tubing which he'd been using as a tourniquet, flexes his

hand.

The door to his room opens.  Scud stands there in silhouette.

INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

Blade emerges into the workshop proper with Whistler and

Scud.

NYSSA AND BLOODPACK

Stand before us.  They represent an assortment of ages and

races, their one unifying characteristic being a callous,

almost fanatical disregard for human life.  In short, these

guys are the most stone-cold motherfuckers we've ever seen.

Their leader, DIETER REINHARDT (30s), is a square-jawed,

chiseled Austrian.  Next to Reinhardt is SNOWMAN, a wire

albino, LIGHTHAMMER, a massive Blackfoot Indian, and PRIEST,

a bald-headed modern primitive with copious piercings and

facial tattoos.  Rounding out the bunch is CHUPA, a blunt

featured Puerto Rican, and VERLAINE, a familiar-looking

curvaceous beauty with bee-stung lips that exudes a predatory

sexuality.

(NOTE: Verlaine looks familiar because she is the twin sister

of Raquel, the bodacious vamp played by Traci Lords that

Blade killed in the opening scene of the first film.)

The vampires LAUGH.  Asad quiets them with a look, then

gestures to them in turn.

Reinhardt advances until he and Blade are nose to nose.

A tense beat.  Then Blade flashes a broad smile.

Blade pulls out one of his silver stakes.  In response, the

vampires reach for their weapons.  But Blade merely twirls it

around his fingers.  Then tosses it to Reinhardt.

Reinhardt looks to Nyssa, uncomfortable.

Blade grabs Reinhardt's wrist, pulling the stake against his

chest, fixing the vampire with the deadliest of poker gazes.

Reinhardt tenses, thrusting the stake forward -- but Blade

has already whirled out of the way, trapping his hand, then

violently twisting it backwards.

Before Reinhardt even knows what's happening, Blade swings

him around into a headlock.  In his free hand he's got a

tiny, barbed flechette.  The barbs spring open like a tick's

gripping mandibles as Blade drives the flechette into the

base of Reinhardt's skull.  Reinhardt HOWLS in pain, but

Blade just tightens his grip, choking off Reinhardt's air.

Reinhardt lets loose a choked GRUNT.  Blade releases him,

dropping the GASPING AUSTRIAN to the floor.

No one says a word.

WHISTLER

Hefting a heavy ordnance case on the table.  Blade and

company sit on one side, the Bloodpack on the other.

Whistler flicks on the entry light.  Then notices that Chupa

isn't paying attention.  The vampire is looking at Snowman

who is saying something in sign-language.  Chupa snickers.

Whistler picks up a massive gun with a modified C-mag

(hundred round cylindrical mag).  It has a strange electromag

assembly barrel with shockwave ports running along it.

Whistler FIRES -- BA-BANG!  A SONIC BOOM rocks the workshop,

SHATTERING a number of windows and computer monitor screens

as a wad of needle rushes just millimeters past Chupa's face,

embedding in the wall behind him.

Blade clears his throat and stands.

MOMENTS LATER

Blade, Whistler, and the Bloodpack are silently suiting up

for war -- strapping on body armor, securing stakes and

knives, CLICKING ammo cartridges into their various weapons.

We SEE them lacing up combat boots, checking rifle sights,

entry lights.  Blade dons one of his EDTA pneumatic

gauntlets.  Whistler loads custom rounds into a shotgun.

Then he reaches to clip on an ammo vest.  But his hands are

shaking slightly and he can't seem to clip the locking

mechanism together.  After a beat, Blade reaches over and

does it for Whistler.  Like a son helping his father.  A beat

passes between them, Whistler and Blade looking at one

another.  Then Whistler nods, satisfied.

As Blade crosses towards Asad and Nyssa, he stops by

Verlaine, sizing her up.

Beat.  Blade smiles coldly.

Blade moves on, stopping before Nyssa.

EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

Blade, Whistler, and the Bloodpack are gathered on a rooftop

overlooking a derelict city block.

THE HOUSE OF PAIN

Rises before them, a Gothic Revival hotel marred by graffiti

scrawls and boarded up windows.  There's a large neon "HOTEL"

sign on the side of the building.

Whistler lifts up a pair of night-vision binoculars and scans

the building.

WHISTLER'S POV (THROUGH BINOCULARS)

He scans the graffiti scrawls, doesn't see anything.

WHISTLER'S POV (THROUGH BINOCULARS)

Whistler switches to infra-red.  A previously unseen Vampire

GLYPH is now revealed, hidden amongst the haphazard graffiti.

Just beneath the glyph are a pair of loading doors set flush

into the concrete sidewalk.

Reinhardt reaches for Whistler, stopping him.

Before things can escalate, Blade steps between them.

Whistler considers Blade's words, then reluctantly nods.

Blade rejoins the vampires.  Reinhardt grins.

Blade pulls out the remote for the flechette in Reinhardt's

head, holding it up for view.

INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - UNDERGROUND ENTRANCE - NIGHT

Nyssa leads the group into a loading area.  The only light is

coming from a series of burning trashcans.  VAMPIRE SENTRIES

crouch on the steps, watching, smelling Nyssa's group as they

move past.  Adjacent areas are walled off with sheets of

vinyl.  We hear the pulsing, bass-heavy beat of MUSIC coming

from beyond the sheeting, beckoning us onward.

INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - UNDERGROUND HALLWAY - NIGHT

The MUSIC is louder.  Neon-lit, corridor-long steel counters

line both walls, displaying various surgical instruments

offered as party favors.  As Blade's scans the area, we SEE

the deadly instruments reflected in his sunglasses.  Nyssa

looks to him.

They reach a steel loading door emblazoned with warning signs

-- the kind that is split horizontally, one-half retracting

into the ceiling, the other into the floor.

On that portentous note, Nyssa hits a button.  The hydraulic

doors open on into --

INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - BALLROOM - NIGHT

A high-ceilinged ballroom packed with SWAYING BODIES.

Retrofitted into a trance-dance hall.  Off to the sides,

people are being pierced, tattooed, ritually scarred.  Silver

trays piled high with razor blades are passed through the

writhing crowd.  Everyone looks suspicious.

AN ELABORATE S&M STAGE SHOW

is under way.  Joel Peter Witkin channeled by Julie Taymor.

A SHE-VAMPIRE hangs from the ceiling, her body supported by

steel pins which have been hooked through her flesh.  THREE

PVC-clad spindly FIGURES minister to her.

TWO VAMPIRES

French kiss, exchanging razor blades with their tongues.

The Bloodpack fans out through the trancing crowd.

ON BLADE

Drifting through the press of flesh.  Feral faces flash by

us, distorted by the stroboscopic lights.  A SHE-VAMPIRE

latches onto him.  He shoves her aside, keeps scanning faces.

It takes every ounce of his restraint not to cut loose.

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

A nondescript van with primer blotches is parked nearby.

INT. OPERATIONS VAN - NIGHT

The interior of the van has been outfitted into a mobile "op

center".  Scud sits in a cluttered nest of electronic

ephermera, munching on a bag of White Castle hamburgers.

He's watching a video feed from a camera mounted on Blade's

gear, listening to the Bloodpack's CHATTER coming in from

various audio channels.  In the background, he's also got

Barry White's "Love Machine" playing.

EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

Whistler is atop the roof of a nearby building, outfitted

with a sniper rifle on a tripod.

WHISTLER'S POV (NIGHT VISION BINOCULARS)

The view pans from the hotel entrance to Scud's van.

Whistler puts down the binoculars, lights a cigarette.  He

takes out a knife and slices open his palm.  He stares at the

blood, his hand slowly trembling.

INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - BALLROOM - NIGHT

Blade works his way through the crowd.  The beat is getting

heavier now, the crowd more energized.  He briefly makes eye

contact with Nyssa, but then she's gone again, disappearing

into the sea of flesh, ducking past one of the vinyl sheets

into a corridor beyond.  Chupa, Asad, Snowman and Priest

remain behind, searching the crowd.

As Blade walks, he notices a series of grates beneath their

feet.  We shift our POV --

INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - DRAINAGE AREA - NIGHT

-- and we are below Blade, looking up at him through the

grate.  We are in a blood-encrusted drainage area just

beneath the ballroom that slopes inward towards a large,

octagonal iron culvert.  As we watch, a section of the

culvert rises, a pair of RED EYES peering out from the

darkness within.

INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - STAIRCASE - NIGHT

Blade follows Nyssa up a narrow staircase into a corridor

lined with gangrenous, peeling wallpaper.  Some of the room

doors are shut, some open.  Clearly, many are occupied.

INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - KITCHEN - NIGHT

A 1930s industrial kitchen filled with corroded equipment.

Reinhardt, Verlaine, and Lighthammer work their way inward,

searching the area.  Lighthammer carries massive war hammer

like his namesake.

Reinhardt nods to Verlaine, who opens a walk-in, shining her

entry light over an assortment of rusting meat hooks.

INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - FIRST CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Blade checks more doorways, catching half-glimpses of FLESH,

LEATHER, and STEEL.  He hears SOBBING, MOANS, WHISPERS.

Then, a distinctly HUMAN WHIMPER catches his attention.

Nyssa opens a door onto an empty room.  A vacant stainless

steel examination table gleams in the center, waiting.

Blade pushes open another door.  We SEE a fearful YOUNG WOMAN

crouching in the corner of a soiled room.  A corpulent

VAMPIRE in a leather apron is hosing down the floor.

Blade makes eye-contact with the woman.  She's clearly human.

Blade tenses.  The corpulent vampire is getting irate when --

THUNK!  Blade throws a sliver stake into the vampire's

forehead.  Even as the vampire turns to ash, Blade motions

for the girl to leave and we're out the hallway again, Nyssa

turning around.

We SEE the woman duck out the room behind him.

INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Reinhardt, Verlaine, and Lighthammer.  A Styrofoam cup rolls

across the floor, blown by a breeze.  Reinhardt pauses,

notices another walk-in freezer door ajar, moves in that

direction.

Unseen behind them, a door BEHIND THEM slowly swings open.

INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - BALLROOM - NIGHT

Chupa, Asad, Snowman and Priest.  THREE SHADOWED FIGURES are

lurking near one of the exits -- skinhead types, each with a

hairline scar running down their chin.

Asad silently motions to snowman and the others, indicating

figures.  Snowman signs something back.  The vampire trio

starts towards them.

INT. OPERATIONS VAN - NIGHT

Bored to shit, Scud plucks a joint from behind his ear.  As

he fires up his woman torso lighter we HEAR SOMETHING just

outside the van.  Scud kills the Barry White, listening.

Silence.  Then, a FAINT SKITTERING.

No response.

Still no response.  Scud reaches for a handgun and creeps

into the front of the van.  He looks out the windshield --

nothing.  He looks left, then right - nothing.

Unnerved, Scud returns to the back of the van.  He reaches

for the handle of the rear door and abruptly jerks the door

open, aiming the gun out --

There's nothing outside the van.  But then Scud hears the

SKITTERING AGAIN.  His eyes shift apprehensively to the floor

of the van below him.

INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - FIRST CORRIDOR - NIGHT

As they near the end of the hall, Blade notices a drop-down

attic door in the ceiling above.  He unsheathes his sword and

uses the tip to unlatch the trapdoor.  The counter-weighted

door CREAKS and LOWERS, unfolding a sectioned ladder.  We see

darkness beyond.  As Blade cautiously mounts the stairs --

Nyssa's attention is drawn to a billowing piece of vinyl.  A

BLURRY FIGURE is visible behind it.  Then it moves away.

Nyssa ducks past the vinyl.

INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - BALLROOM - NIGHT

As the music reaches a crescendo, Asad notices MORE SHADOWY

FIGURES by another exit.  And even MORE by a third.  Snowman

signs to Asad again, more urgently this time, as the first

potential Reaper begins to turn and we are --

INT. OPERATIONS VAN - NIGHT

-- back with Scud.  He ducks his head outside, looking

beneath the van.  Nothing there.  Relieved, Scud shuts the

rear door, laughs to himself.

A PAIR OF CLAWED HANDS

Suddenly rip down through the ceiling of the van, peeling it

up and back like it was tinfoil!  A REAPER with a bloody

bandage covering his eye SNARLS down at us.

INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - BALLROOM - NIGHT

The first skinhead figure spins towards us.  It's a Reaper.

All three of them are, eyes wide with bloodlust as they leap

at Asad and the others.

Suddenly, the Reapers are everywhere, blocking the exits,

ripping into their vampire victims, tossing them aside like

toys.  Vampires scream and run, some taking to the walls as a

means of escape, some racing across the ceiling.

INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - FIRST CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Blade stops half-way up the ladder as he hears GUNFIRE.  He

drops back to the floor, then notices that Nyssa is gone.  HE

pushes through the vinyl curtain and finds -- Nyssa forced

back against the wall, wrestling with --

-- Nomak, who swings his head around towards Blade!  Blade

FIRES his MACH pistol point-blank into Nomak's face, blasting

the Reaper backwards --

But Nomak is back on his feet in a split-second, SMASHING

through a window onto the fire escape beyond.  Blade rushes

to the window, looks out --

BLADE'S POV

Nomak is scaling his way straight up the neon hotel sign,

jumping from one letter to the next with lightning speed.

INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - KITCHEN - NIGHT

A Reaper EXPLODES out from the walk-in, rather than the door

behind them.  He leaps atop Reinhardt, SLAMMING him to the

floor.  Lighthammer swings his hammer, missing the Reaper,

taking out a chunk of the wall instead.

Lighthammer swings and misses again, taking a chunk out of

the floor.  Verlaine empties her automatic rifle into the

Reaper even as --

The Reaper turns on Lighthammer, catching the war hammer,

Reaper's lower jaw disengages and splits open, revealing a

freakishly enlarged esophagus lined with serrated, sharklike

teeth.

All of this takes a split-second.  No time for Lighthammer to

react as the Reaper latches its grossly expanded mouth onto

his throat and begins draining him before our eyes.  The

Reaper SHUDDERS and the whites of his eyes bleed red as an

ecstatic wave washes over him.  His pale flesh, pulsing with

engorged veinwork, becomes flushed, turning crimson as --

Lighthammer's face becomes increasingly pallid!  His face

begins caving inward, shrinking as every millimeter of blood

is vacuumed out of him.

BLOOD VESSELS

Are popping up beneath the Reaper's briefly translucent skin,

becoming engorged and dilated.  The veins continue to swell,

racing up his neck, then branching out over his face, chest,

and arms -- like an instant network of varicose veins.

Verlaine retreats, horrified.  Reinhardt scurries backwards,

then scrambles to his feet, running for his life into --

INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - BALLROOM - NIGHT

Chaos.  Vampire patrons flee.  The Bloodpack FIRE, unleashing

a hailstorm of bullets, cutting into vampires and Reapers

alike as --

EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT

Blade steps out onto the icy fire escape.  CRASH!  Nomak has

dislodged the "H" from the hotel sign.  It comes HURTLING

towards Blade, who ducks back into the center of the "O" to

avoid being hit.  The "H" continues falling, SMASHING down

into the street near the Mystery Van where --

INT/EXT. OPERATIONS VAN - NIGHT

Scud unloads his handgun into the Reaper atop the van.  The

Reaper should turn to ash, but it doesn't!  Scud flees,

DIVING into the front of the van, ducking behind the wheel.

He keys the ignition --

WHAM!  Now the Reaper is atop the hood, SMASHING his feet

through the windshield.  Scud SCREAMS as he slams the van

into the drive and floors the pedal --

WK-KRUNCH!  Scud CRASHES the van against the side of a

building, pinning the Reaper between the van's front bumper

and the crumbling wall.  He keeps his foot on the gas pedal,

GRINDING the van's wheels.

This gambit should cut the Reaper in half, or at the very

least, fatally wound it -- but it only enrages it further.

The Reaper stretches forward across the van's crumpled hood

and resumes BATTERING away at the cracked windshield --

Scud fumbles for the headlights.  They won't go on!  Then he

notices a mess of wiring haphazardly duct-taped together.  He

reaches for the wiring, fiddling with it --

INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - BALLROOM - NIGHT

The Reaper nearest Priest turns in his direction.  We

recognize her as the Nurse from the bloodbank.  She LEAPS at

Priest --

Priest fires a Glaser round through the she-Reaper's head.

The Reaper twists in mid-leap, falls to the floor, then picks

herself up again.  Like Scud's Reaper, she seems unaffected

by the custom-made ammo.

ON THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE BLOODPACK

Having similarly disastrous results.  The Reapers are

shrugging off their firepower.  Asad leaps, snapping a

Reaper's neck with a spinning heel kick, but the Reaper keeps

coming!

BACK TO THE PRIEST

Alarmed, reaching for a specialized shotgun instead.  The

Reaper continues forward, moving so fast she almost seems a

blur as BA-BOOM! BA-BOOM!  Priest pumps his shotgun

repeatedly.  Two projectiles fire out, chained together by a

length of titanium cable.  The cable catches the Reaper in

the mid-section, cutting it clean in half!

The upper half of the Reaper falls, then rights itself,

landing on its clawed hands.

Impossibly, the she-Reaper keeps coming!  She skitters

towards Priest on his hands like the half-man from Todd

Browning's "FREAKS".

The half-Reaper launches itself at Priest, hitting him in the

chest, knocking him back to the floor.  Priest panics as he

struggles with the thing, trying to fend off its claws and

fangs as it locks its mouth into his arm.  He SCREAMS.

EXT. VAN - NIGHT

As Scud continues to fiddle with the faulty headlight wiring,

the windshield finally SHATTERS beneath the Reaper's pounding

fists.  It latches onto Scud's collar and pulls him forward

over the wheel even as the seam/scar in its chin splits apart

and the Reaper's enlarged maw flowers open.  Scud is just

centimeters away from having his face being bitten off when --

-- the wires SPARK and the headlights come on, illuminating

the Reaper in a wash of UV light!  The effect is

instantaneous.  The Reaper HOWLS and lets go, then promptly

BURSTS INTO FLAMES.

Scud cups his ear, shouting via the comm system.

INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - BASEMENT - NIGHT

Asad hears Scud's message as he continues fending off a

Reaper's attack.  Then he manages to get hold of his rifle.

He FLICKS on the UV entry light, aiming it at the Reaper's

face.  The Reaper's head catches fire.  Asad SHOUTS to the

others --

One by one, the members of the Bloodpack CLICK ON the entry

lights mounted atop their guns.  It's working -- the UV beams

are the only thing that seems to be driving the Reapers back.

EXT. HOUSE OF PAIN - ROOF - DAWN

BOOM!  Blade kicks open the roof access door.  He hurries

outside, followed by Nyssa, who hesitates when she SEES --

THE SUN

beginning to rise beyond the cityscape horizon.  Nomak is

already at the opposite side of the building, moving fast.

Nyssa falls back into the shadows as Blade continues onward,

unsheathing his sword.

EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

Whistler's sniper rifle and binoculars have been abandoned

and --

EXT. HOUSE OF PAIN - ROOFTOP - DAWN

We're back with Blade as he chases Nomak across the roof.

UP AHEAD

Nomak abruptly stops, having reached the end of the roof.

The nearest neighboring rooftop is too far away and the drop

from this last ledge looks unsurvivable, even for someone

like Nomak.

As Blade cautiously advances, Nomak turns around and smiles --

a wolfish grin, unnaturally wide.  The Reaper's face is

beginning to smoke beneath the rising sun's rays.  In

response, a polarized nictomembrane slides down over Nomak's

irises -- like something you'd see on a crocodile to protect

its eyes from harsh light.

Nomak LAUGHS, then LUNGES, scooping up a rusty iron bar that

lies nearby.  He swings it at Blade.  Blade parries and steps

backward, taking a blow to the head in the process, then

another to the side.

The two of them exchange a flurry of blows back and forth

until their weapons lock and they are face to face.  Nomak's

back is to the rising sun, now.  His whole body is beginning

to lightly smoke.

Both men are trembling, straining against their weapons,

using every ounce of strength to keep the other at bay.  And

just when it looks like Nomak is gaining the upper hand --

-- Blade pivots the flat edge of his sword upwards, catching

the light of the rising sun, reflecting it directly into

Nomak's eyes!

Nomak SCREAMS and rears back, his face catching fire.  Then

he stumbles backwards and falls -- right off the ledge of the

roof!  Blade hurries to the roof's ledge and looks down --

But the Reaper is nowhere in sight.  Dumbfounded, Blade

retreats, haunted by the conviction that Nomak is still

alive.

INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - BALLROOM - DAWN

Blade has returned to the scene of the melee.  The Reapers

have fled, leaving Nyssa and the others to lick their wounds

and survey the carnage.  Quite a few full-body ash outlines

marking the passing of various vampires.  Blade approaches

Nyssa.  She notices his wounds.

Beat.  Tense.  Does he trust this woman?  No way.

Just then, we hear an unearthly SCREAM.

ANGLE ON

Priest, being held down by Chupa and Snowman.  He's thrashing

about, clutching his wounded, infected arm.

Priest lets loose an agonized SCREAM as Blade and the others

gather around him.  He's undergoing a horrific change, taking

on the gaunt, vein-engorged features of a proper Reaper.  He

SNARLS and WAILS, GNASHING his teeth like a rabid animal.

Reinhardt and his team look uneasy.  Shaken by their

teammate's downward progression.

Blade draws closer.  Already, the flesh on Priest's chin is

splitting as a seam begins to form.

Reinhardt paces, annoyed by Priest's WAILING.

As if in response, Priest starts convulsing.  His flesh

tightens, drawing taut around his increasingly skeletal form.

His screams become unbearable, twisting into a high-pitched

ululation that's making the Bloodpack's skin crawl.

Asad pulls out his handgun and empties the clip into Priest's

body -- but Priest keeps SHRIEKING.

Unnerved, Reinhardt unsheathes a machete, decapitating Priest

even as the others protest.

The headless body continues thrashing, still making noise

from it's open throat!  If anything, it seems to be

redoubling its efforts.  It LURCHES forward, jerking itself

free from Chupa and Snowman's restraining arms.

The juddering horror that used to be Priest staggers to its

feet.  Reinhardt and his men panic, stumbling backwards.  The

headless monstrosity LUNGES STRAIGHT AT --

BLADE

Without batting an eye, he draws his MACH pistol, briefly

aiming at the on-rushing creature's chest, then adjusting his

aim to one of the blacked-out windows above and behind it.

BAM!BAM!BAM!  Blade shoots out the window and BLAZING SHAFT

OF SUNLIGHT slices down through the darkness, spotlighting

Priest like an ant beneath a magnifying glass.

FWASH!!!  The headless body is incinerated in mid-step.  It

collapses to the floor, just inches before Blade.  One of its

blackened claws feebly grabs Blade's boot, then grows still.

Beat.  You could hear the pin drop in the silence that

follows, every one of the Bloodpack thinking some variation

of "there but for the grace of God go I".  Asad lays a hand

on Nyssa's shoulder, steadying her.

Blade shifts his foot, causing the cinder-like hand gripping

his boot to crumble to dust.

Blade looks over to see Whistler, who is just entering.  He

moves over to him, angry.  Chupa follows, equally pissed.

Chupa flushes with anger and flicks his knife across

Whistler's shoulder, opening a gash.  Whistler goes ballistic

and PUNCHES Chupa in the face.  A brief tussle ensues before

Blade and the others can separate them.  As Chupa is pulled

away by Asad, he looks back at Whistler.

INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - DRAINAGE AREA - CONTINUOUS

Whistler, Blade and the surviving members of the Bloodpack

are now gathered around the octagonal iron culvert just

beneath the ballroom.  Whistler turns on a flashlight.  We

HEAR something moving in the darkness.  The group tenses,

then Whistler's flashlight beam reveals --

A REAPER

Cowering by the culvert.  One we recognize.  The other

vampire guard from the bloodbank, now transformed.  He's

shrunken and emaciated, pale.  And although he's obviously

dying, he still HISSES, his fanged mouth snapping

ineffectually at them.  His arm has been trapped -- pinned

under one of the sectional culvert coverings.  It looks like

he's been trying to gnaw it off in order to escape.

Blade looks to the culvert in question.  He pulls back one of

the sectioned covers.  The opening is about two feet wide,

just large enough for a man to gain access.

INT. SEWER/OUTFLOW AREA - CONTINUOUS

Blade drops into the sewer line.  The area is claustrophobic,

damp.  There are torn pieces of insulation hanging from the

ceiling, saturated and dripping with blood.

Blade crouch-walks further in.  We hear WIND.  He shines his

FLASHLIGHT.  A portion of the brick wall looks like it's been

clawed open.

Blade retreats back to the drain-pipe, pulling himself back

up.  We HOLD for a beat, then drift up to the blood-saturated

strips of insulation.  SOMEONE is crouched in the shadows

there, clinging to the ceiling upside down.

It's NOMAK, red-eyes shining in the darkness.

INT. DAMASKINO'S LAIR - BATHHOUSE - DAY

We are in a previously unseen portion of Damaskino's vast

bedroom.  An elegantly tiled pool area has been partitioned

off by a series of latticed screens.  In the counterpoint to

this are a series of muted monitors tuned to the pulse of the

world -- CNN, MSNBC, C-SPAN, etc.

Damaskinos sits in a robe, finishing a meal, his eyes

flicking over the monitors -- tracking current events, market

fluctuations.  We get the sense that the man is a true

polymath.  That he owes his five thousand-plus years of

existence to resourcefulness rather than luck.

Stevens enters, waiting to be acknowledged.

Unconcerned, Damaskinos slices into a piece of raw meat.

Damaskinos steps beyond the screens now, into the pool area --

and although we can't see the water from this angle, we can

see patterns of ruby light flickering off the tiled walls.

Stevens follows, uncomfortable.

Damaskinos steps into the steaming liquid, which we now see

is BLOOD.  His robe spreads out, floating on the surface.

Damaskinos sinks until he's waist-deep in the crimson fluid.

Stevens looks to a shelf where a gold and crystal Coptic jar

rests.  A HUMAN HEART floats within.

INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - CELL - NIGHT

The dying Reaper has now been chained inside the cell.  It

WHEEZES and MOANS, clearly in agony.  Blade and Nyssa stand

watch.  Blade grips the Reaper beneath its jaw, turning its

face towards us.

Blade nicks the Reaper's carotid artery with a knife.  CLEAR

SERUM oozes out, no red blood cells at all.

As they watch, the Reaper shakes through its final death

throes, then grows still, the nictomembranes over its eyes

slowly sliding down.

MOMENTS LATER - A SERIES OF ISOLATED CLOSE-UPS

A pair of GLOVED HANDS spreads apart the Reaper's eyelids.

In response, the protective nictomembrane slides mechanically

down over the pupil.

The hands now part the Reaper's mouth, probing the seam in

the chin, then splitting the mandible apart to reveal the

enlarged esophagus.  The fingers push back on the gums and

the pressure-sensitive fangs extend even further in response.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL

Blade, Nyssa, and Scud are gathered around the autopsy table.

The rest of the crew linger further back.

Nyssa begins the Y-incision along the chest.  Once again,

CLEAR SERUM oozes out.  She cracks open the thoracic cavity.

We SEE inside the abdominal cavity.  A complex, pinkish/gray

parasitic organism has taken over every organ visible.

She pulls back the lungs -- a calcified structure encasing a

fibrous mass rests where the heart would normally be.  She

taps the calcified structure with a scalpel.

She tries to cut into the bony shell and the scalpel snaps.

Scud WHISTLES, impressed.

Blade studies the Reaper corpse, then looks to the Bloodpack.

Blade spins and leaves.  Whistler follows.  Nyssa watches

them disappear into Blade's room.  Reinhardt and the other

vampires approach her.

Nyssa just stares him down, obviously conflicted.

Snowman signs something to Verlaine.

Asad looks to Nyssa once more -- perhaps he's even concerned

now.  She's still staring in the direction Blade left.

INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - BLADE'S SLEEPING AREA - NIGHT

Blade sits in the shadows, wrapping a piece of rubber tubing

around his arm, injecting himself with pneumatic syringe of

serum.  He shivers, convulses violently, then throws back his

head in relief.  When he does so, he SEES --

Whistler standing in the doorway.  They eye each other a

moment as Blade unwraps the tubing from his arm, puts away

his syringe and serum.  Whistler lights a cigarette, then

nods through a window towards Nyssa and the others.

Blade moves to walk away, but Whistler stops him.

Whistler steps closer, his voice dropping to a lethal,

whisper.

Blade stares back at Whistler, calm as a viper.

The two comrades in arms stare each other down.  Then,

finally, Whistler backs away.

Whistler turns and strides exits.  We HOLD ON Blade, torn,

conflicted, watching Whistler retreat.

EXT. BLADE'S WAREHOUSE/SHIPYARD - NIGHT

We SEE a FIGURE emerge from the shadows -- CHUPA.

EXT. CITY SLUM - NIGHT

Chupa walks the night, scanning shadows.

CHUPA'S POV (VAMPIRE VISION)

Like heat-vision, only tinged with crimson.  There are DRUG

DEALERS and bottom feeding WHORES trolling for tricks out

here, BEATING HEARTS and BRANCHING ARTERIES highlighted on

their ghostly silhouettes.

Chupa moves to the mouth of an alley, nodding to a DEALER.

As the dealer glances around to see if anyone's watching --

Chupa sniffs the air, glancing at a pulsating vein on the

dealer's neck, and smiles.

Chupa steps into the alley with the dealer.

Chupa is at the dealer's throat before he can finish,

flashing his fangs, shoving him backwards.  Then --

WHAP!  A HAND

Grabs a fistful of Chupa's hair, jerking his head back.  It's

Blade.  He yanks Chupa off the dealer.

The dealer takes off as Blade swings Chupa around.  They

exchange a couple of blows, then Blade knees him in the

balls, twisting him around by his arm, dislocating it.

Blade releases Chupa, shoving him forward.  Chupa's broken

arm dangles awkwardly.  Furious, Chupa reaches for his .45

with his good hand -- only to hear the CLICK of another gun

as it's placed against the back of his head.

ANGLE ON NYSSA

Standing behind him, looking grim and determined.

Chupa re-holsters his gun, then jams his dislocated arm up

against the wall and resets it.  He backs away.  Nyssa

watches him leave, looks to Blade.

Blade doesn't answer, just moves away.  She follows.

Off Blade's stony expression we --

INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

The back of the workshop.  Scud takes a hit of weed then

resumes working on one of the UV entry lights -- it's been

taken half-apart and tweaked-out with cables and a crystal

prism.  Whistler is there too, loading magazines.

Scud pulls up his T-shirt.  His abdomen is covered in a

network of horrific scars.  Like something you'd see on the

survivor of a shark attack.

Scud takes a Phillip and adjust some screws on the laser.

Scud jiggles the necklace of fangs around his neck.

Scud triggers the modified entry light.  The light PULSES

like a series of flash-bulbs going off, creating a

stroboscopic effect as a wafer-thin, super-concentrated BLUE

BEAM OF LIGHT slices through the shadows.  Scud looks to

Whistler and smiles.

EXT. CITYSCAPE - PRE-DAWN

Beyond the shadowed skyline of monolithic buildings, the

night is beginning to give way to dawn.

INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - PRE-DAWN

Scud stands before the others.  He looks bleary-eyed but

pleased with the night's work.  The fruit of their efforts

are laid on a work table before them -- a half-dozen UV laser

guns, along with a collection of UV flashbang grenades and a

much bigger explosive device secured into a backpack carrier.

Blade picks up one of the UV lasers.  He sights down the

length of it.  Scud takes a power pack and slaps into the

base of Blade's gun.

Nyssa gestures to the flashbang grenades.

Asad looks to Blade.

Blade looks to Nyssa, who tosses Reinhardt an aerosol

cannister.  He sprays a little, then wrinkles his nose in

disgust, gagging.

INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - DRAINAGE AREA - DAWN

Beneath the ballroom gratings.  A high-angle shot looking

down at the octagonal iron culvert around which Blade,

Whistler, and the remainder of the Bloodpack are gathered.

The mechanized, sectional portions of the culvert covering

are GRINDING UPWARD, flowering open and apart like some blood

and rust-encrusted gateway to Hell.

INT. SEWER/OUTFLOW AREA - DAWN

One by one, the group of hunters descend into the

claustrophobic chamber.  Verlaine is lugs the UV bomb on her

back.  Blade leads them to the clawed-open portion of the

brick wall, then on through.

INT. SEWER LINE - CONTINUOUS

Blade leads the group along a grime-encrusted line which

slopes gradually downward, sloshing through ankle-deep run

off water collected from the city above them.  Tendrils of

mist drift about, cutting their field of vision even further.

Here and there, thin SHAFTS of SUNLIGHT cut down through

cracks in the street above, requiring the vampires to

cautiously circumvent them.

They reach a four-way intersection of tunnels.  Blade pauses.

Blade opens a statchel.  Inside are a dozen distinctive

aluminum atomizers.  He hands them out to the others.

Whistler triggers a can, spraying a thin mist over his face,

wrinkling his noses in disgust.

Blade points to Chupa and Whistler, indicating the Eastern

tunnel.  They head off.  Next, Blade directs Nyssa, Asad,

Snowman, and Verlaine down the Western tunnel.  Blade nods to

Reinhardt and starts down the Northern branch.

INT. EASTERN TUNNEL - DAY

It's darker here, no shafts of sunlight slicing down from

above.  Whistler turns on his UV entry light.  Chupa reaches

out with his hand, partially blocking the beam.

As the shifting patterns of light and shadow play across

Chupa's face we SEE his pupils contract and dilate

unnaturally large in response.

Chupa tosses Whistler a pair of night-vision goggles.

Chupa heads into the darkness, moving with uncanny speed.

INT. TUNNELS - VARIOUS

We intercut between the three teams now, back and forth as

they progress deeper into the city's bowels.

INT. NORTHERN TUNNEL - DAY

Blade and Reinhardt trudge along.  The tunnel slopes inward,

forming a V-shaped channel where a trickle of water flows.

Blade notices SOMETHING bobbing in the water.  He nudges it

with his foot and knocks it free.  It's a broken HUMAN TIBIA

which twirls around, then flows past their legs.

A few steps later on, Reinhardt notices SOMETHING ELSE.  He

stoops into waist-deep water, picking up what he thinks is an

isolated HUMAN RIB -- but ends up snagging a tangled mass of

hair, mud, and bones.

INT. EASTERN TUNNEL - DAY

Whistler and Chupa move side by side.  Chupa is anxious, eyes

darting about.  Occasionally, they come upon a transection

with smaller conduits leading off to the right and the left.

Then they reach a stooped, narrower tunnel and have to move

single file.

Suddenly, a BLAST of LIGHT and THUNDEROUS SOUND explodes

above them.  They look up --

A subway TRAIN rockets by on a track just above them,

pummeling them with soot and dust.

Unseen by them, briefly illuminated by the flashing subway

lights we see three Reaper faces, pale and haunting, hanging

upside down.

INT. NORTHERN TUNNEL - DAY

Blade and Reinhardt reach a dead-end where the tunnel has

caved in.  A BERM OF HUMAN BONES slopes upward from the water

-- skulls and ribs, vertebrae, tibias, metatarsi.  Blade

kneels, inspecting them.  There are gnaw marks on them.

INT. WESTERN TUNNEL - DAY

As Nyssa, Snowman, Verlaine, and Asad cautiously move

forward, Nyssa GASPS, startled by --

HALF A DOZEN REAPERS laying on the tunnel floor before them

in a stagnant pool of sewage water.  Dead.

INT. EASTERN TUNNEL - DAY

Back with Whistler and Chupa, Whistler is in the lead.

As Whistler turns around, Chupa SLAMS Whistler in the side of

the head, swiping his night-vision goggles off.  As Whistler

vainly searches for his goggles.

Chupa moves stealthily in darkness, violently KICKING the

older man.  Whistler tries to crawl away, then reaches for

his pheromone atomizer and locks it in the "on-position".  As

Chupa continues to lay into Whistler we SEE the atomizer roll

away, dispensing its contents.

INT. NORTHERN TUNNEL - DAY

Blade and Reinhardt by the berm of human bones.

INT. WESTERN TUNNEL - DAY

Nyssa nods to Asad and Verlaine.  They train their UV lasers

on the area where the Reaper corpses were -- but the Reaper

bodies are gone.  And so is Snowman for that matter.

Just then, we hear a NOISE from above.  Nyssa and the others

whip their UV lasers in that direction.

THEIR POV

A HORDE OF REAPERS skitter away from the lights.

INT. EASTERN TUNNEL - DAY

CLOSE ON the pheromone atomizer, the spray petering out.

Whistler is beat to shit, bleeding from his mouth.  Chupa

reaches for his handgun, whipping it out just as --

Whistler's hands brush the damaged night vision goggles.  He

swings them upward.

WHISTLER'S POV (THROUGH GOGGLES)

Whistler has just enough time to register Chupa, the handgun

pointed directly at him/us before noticing SOMETHING ELSE

just beyond Chupa.

A DOZEN REAPERS

Clinging to the ceiling above.  They drop down on Chupa like

a pack of rabid dogs, literally tearing him in half.

INT. NORTHERN TUNNEL - DAY (20 YEARS AGO)

Hearing GUNFIRE and SCREAMS, Blade charges back in Whistler's

direction as --

THE BERM OF HUMAN BONES

EXPLODE apart.  Reapers CHARGE towards them, hitting Blade in

the chest, driving him backwards.  As Blade falls, his entry

light swings upward, illuminating.

ANOTHER REAPER

Drops down atop Reinhardt, knocking his UV gun into the

water.  We SEE even MORE REAPERS converging in on them from

the side tunnels in a cacophony of SHADOW and NOISE.

INT. WESTERN TUNNEL - DAY (20 YEARS AGO)

Verlaine, Nyssa and Asad are FIRING their UV lasers.  The

pumping flashes of their guns throw crazy shadows in every

direction.  Adding to the unbridled chaos of strobing light

and NOISE.  More and more Reapers are swarming towards them,

moving towards us at an unearthly clip!  Nyssa and her

compatriots retreat, running for their lives.

A REAPER

Leaps, landing on Verlaine's back.  It grabs her head and

deftly SNAPS her spine in half with a sickening CRUNCH!

INT. EASTERN TUNNEL - DAY (20 YEARS AGO)

Whistler panics, backing away from the SOUNDS of the reapers

slaughtering Chupa.  He finds his gun, flicks on the UV entry

light --

And just like that, the attacking reapers have vanished.

Whistler whirls about, sweeping the UV beam around, but all

he SEES is darkness.

Then, a bone-chilling WHISPER cuts through the shadows.

Whistler spins.  NOMAK RIGHT BEHIND HIM.  As Whistler whips

the UV gun up, Nomak stops it.  The beam is mere millimeters

from the Reaper's face -- close enough to illuminate his

nightmarish features, but not close enough to burn.

In an eyeblink, Nomak is gone.  Whistler spins, shining the

UV this way and that.  Alone in the dark.

INT. NORTHERN TUNNEL - DAY

Blade FIRES his UV into a Reaper's torso.  As the Reaper

incinerates, Blade spins, FIRING at a second Reaper --

ON REINHARDT

Firing his non-UV weapon.  Two Reapers are closing in on him.

Blade throws Reinhardt his UV laser and unsheathes his sword.

Reinhardt sweeps the lethal beam over the two reapers.

Blade retreats back into the water, calm, letting the

creatures comes to him.  As they close in on him, he slips

the tip of the sword beneath the surface of the water,

waiting --

As one, the Reapers converge on Blade.  He swings his sword

up from the water, hacking away at them, using their own

momentum against them.

Reinhardt considers his options.  He decides to run for it --

Reinhardt races away, abandoning Blade.  Blade reaches for

one of the UV flashbangs clipped to his harness.  He pulls

the pin with his teeth and shoves it into an on-rushing

Reaper's mouth as --

Reinhardt slips on the wet concrete and --

BANG!  Searing LIGHT fills the tunnel, instantly incinerating

the Reaper.

Reinhardt's unprotected face CATCHES FIRE.   He SCREAMS,

falling back into the water, trying to douse the flames.

ANOTHER REAPER lands atop him, dragging him down as --

INT. NORTHERN AND WESTERN TUNNELS - CONTINUOUS

We hear GUNFIRE and SCREAMS coming from all directions.

Blade retreats.  A reaper, fully ON FIRE from the UV

explosion, races towards him.  As Blade decapitates it:

Asad and Nyssa also retreat.  Nyssa pulls a pin on a UV

flashbang, throws it behind her.  BA-BANG!  UV light fills

the tunnels and --

INT. SEWER LINE - FOUR-WAY INTERSECTION - DAY

Blade, Nyssa, Whistler and Asad abruptly find themselves back

in the four-way juncture, knee-deep in water.  They quickly

regroup, out of breath, riding adrenaline highs.

The others turn to look in Blade's direction.

DOZENS OF RED EYES

are staring out at them from the darkness of the Eastern

Tunnel.  Then we hear a HISSING SOUND coming from the

opposite direction.  Blade and the others spin around --

MORE RED-EYED REAPERS

are closing in on them from the West.  AND THE NORTH.  AND

THE SOUTH!  There must be forty of them in all.

They retreat until they are back to back, each one of them

covering their respective tunnel opening.

A REAPER

Lunges at them from the North.  Asad triggers his UV laser,

scorching the creature.  It HOWLS and slinks backwards.

TWO MORE REAPERS

Attack from the East and the West.  Blade and Nyssa respond

in kind, burning their assailants in mid-air.  But even as

they fire, their UV beams weaken, the flashes of light coming

from their barrels pulsing less frequently.

The foursome are managing to keep the Reapers at bay, but

just barely.  Blade motions to Nyssa.

Nyssa reaches inside her harness, handing Blade the remaining

atomizers.  He crushes them in his fist, letting the fluid

within spill over his face and chest.

The Reapers become even more agitated, HISSING loudly,

pressing in on them closer and closer.  Blade nods his head

back down the Western tunnel.

Asad studies Blade with newfound respect.

The foursome spin, FIRING their UV lasers down the Western

tunnel.  The Reapers SHRIEK, falling to either side, their

bodies burning --

Blade CHARGES FORWARD, firing his dying UV laser.  As he

makes it past the line of Reapers, they start after him,

driven into a frenzy by the pheromones.  The Reapers in the

Northern and Eastern tunnels flood after Blade too, leaving --

Nyssa, Whistler and Asad to contend with the Reapers in the

Southern tunnel.  They discharge their weapons, shouldering

Reapers aside, making a mad dash for freedom.

INT. WESTERN TUNNEL - DAY

Blade runs, splashing and stumbling through the water, just a

hair's breadth ahead of the HOWLING Reaper horde.  Suddenly,

the tunnel widens out into a larger chamber.

INT. SOUTHERN TUNNEL - DAY

Whistler and the others FIRE BACK at the small group of

Reapers which have followed them, rather than Blade.

ON WHISTLER

cut off from Nyssa and Asad.  He spots a maintenance ladder

and runs for it, dragging himself up the rungs.  A Reaper

leaps up the ladder after him --

Whistler reaches the top of the ladder, but his exit is

blocked by a manhole cover!  It's STUCK!  Whistler swings up

his shotgun, FIRING into the cover.

The cover is BLOWN UPWARDS, sending a shaft of blinding

sunlight down on the Reaper below him.  As the Reaper

incinerates, Whistler scurries upwards to safety.

INT. WESTERN TUNNEL/CHAMBER - DAY

Blade reaches Verlaine's half-submerged body.  He tears the

backpack carrier off the dead vampire and hefts it onto his

shoulder, charging up an elevated concrete embankment as --

INT. SOUTHERN TUNNEL - DAY

Nyssa and Asad find themselves cornered.  Their UV lasers are

shot.  The Reapers are closing in and we're --

INT. WESTERN TUNNEL/CHAMBER - DAY

Back with Blade, the Reapers overrunning him.  They pile atop

one another in a frenzied effort to get to him.  Dozens and

dozens of them.  And still Blade struggles upward, lifting

the UV cluster bomb triumphantly above his head, triggering

the device.

The world goes white.

No explosions.  Just BLINDING, PURIFYING LIGHT leaving us

with a retina-burn image of Blade's silhouette surrounded by

Reapers.  In that brief instant, the Reapers are frozen,

revealed as WRAITH-LIKE X-RAY IMAGES of bone and muscle.

INT. SOUTHERN TUNNEL - DAY

A BLAST-WAVE of LIGHT fills the tunnel, chasing its way

towards Nyssa and Asad, overtaking the Reapers before them.

Asad throws himself at Nyssa, knocking her into the knee-deep

water, shielding her body with his own.

BENEATH THE WATER

Asad still burns, flaring up and disintegrating from the

surface on downward like a piece of liquid-drenched

magnesium, bubbles streaming from his writing body.

INT. WESTERN TUNNEL - DAY

Darkness, then patterns of subtle shadow and light as our

vision slowly returns.  FWASH!  Blade strikes a FLARE.  In

the sputtering aureole, the aftermath is slowly revealed.

Blade crouches, unscathed, as if he were standing ground zero

in the aftermath of Hiroshima.  Scores of Reaper ash-outlines

radiate out from him, some of them flash-seared into the

surrounding brickwork walls like permanent shadows.

INT. SOUTHERN TUNNEL - DAY

Blade slowly makes his way down the tunnel, using the

sputtering flare to guide him.  As before, he sees nothing

but Reaper ash outlines.  But then, Blade sees --

NYSSA

Bleeding and horribly burned despite Asad's sacrifice.  Blade

crouches, scooping her up into his arms.

INT. HOSPITAL - INNER-CITY TRAUMA WARD - DAY

BANG!  Blade kicks open a pair of doors, hurrying Nyssa

inside.  He's carrying her limp form in his arms, having

wrapped her in a blanket.  Blade himself looks like hell

warmed over -- covered in blood, ash, and grime.

He rushes her towards the ER, navigating through a maze of

PATIENTS and VISITORS.  An ER NURSE approaches.

WHAM!  Blade shoulders the ER NURSE aside, barreling into the

triage where bewildered DOCTORS and ORDERLIES wait.

Blade sets Nyssa down on an operating table, pulling off the

blanket.  She's badly burned and she's lost an enormous

amount of blood.  As we watch, she GROANS, revealing her

fangs.

Just then, a POLICEMAN enters, gun drawn.

WHAP!  Blade slaps the cop's gun away and KICKS him in the

chest.  The cop flies backwards, SLAMS into a bank of

equipment, falls.  A NURSE SCREAMS.  In a near blur, Blade

has his MACH out and pressed against the Doctor's forehead.

Blade unsheathes his sword, deftly drawing the edge across

his wrist, opening a vein.  He cradles Nyssa's head, pulling

her mouth to the wound on his wrist.  And as she starts to

feed we pull back and --

EXT. THE CITY - DUSK

The sun dips towards the horizon.  The shadows of the urban

landscape lengthen and darken in time-lapse.

INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - SHOWERS - DUSK

Blade stands beneath the showerhead, turning his face up into

the scalding spray, rinsing the blood from his chiseled

physique.  Crimson water circles the drain.

INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - BLADE'S SLEEPING AREA - DUSK

Nyssa now rests on a cot.  Peaceful, the color having

somewhat returned to her features.  After a moment, her eyes

flutter open and she takes in her surroundings.  She is in

Blade's austere bedroom -- there are tatami mats, a basin for

water, a well-thumbed volume of Zen koans.

A SHAFT OF SUNLIGHT

cuts through an icy window pane above, angling down near

Nyssa's cot.  Dust motes swirl about it.

Nyssa focuses on it.  Longingly.  Then she raises her arm and

reaches towards it.  Closer, closer -- just barely extending

her hand into the light.  Her fingertips blacken and smoke,

yet Nyssa endures the pain for another moment.  Finally, she

withdraws her hand, inspecting the damage -- then notices

Blade watching her from the doorway.

She looks back to the sunlight, wistful, sits herself up.

Blade enters, kneeling by the edge of the cot, inspecting her

wounds.  Studiously avoiding her gaze.

She reaches for his face.  Blade stops her hand.

Blade stands now, moving to the ice-covered window, troubled

by the question.  Damned if he knows the answer.  After a

beat, Nyssa rises too, keeping to the shadows.

Nyssa pursues Blade, circling around in front of him so he

has to face her again.

Blade moves away.  She reaches for his shoulder.  He whirls

on her, angry, traps her hand.  She tires to pull it free but

he grips her wrist tightly, pulling her closer --

And closer, their faces are just inches apart now --

And Blade kisses her, hungrily.  Nyssa responds in kind.  Her

head drops low, her mouth finding the cords of his neck --

sucking at his flesh, then sinking her teeth in deep and --

WHAM!  Blade clamps a hand around her throat, slamming her

head back.  A droplet of blood dribbles from her lips as she

lets loose a breathless shudder.  She's in the ecstatic

throes of the Thirst now, all reason gone.

Blade reaches his other hand to her shirt, ripping it open as

he runs his fingers across her breasts, then over her exposed

rib cage.  He turns her around, forcing her against the wall,

sinking his own fangs into the back of her neck.  She groans

as we --

THE TWO OF THEM

Naked on the tatami mats upon which Blade sleeps.  Skin

beaded with sweat.  Breath steaming in the chill air.  He's

atop her, moving inside her with measured thrusts.

Nyssa's limbs are wrapped around him.  She claws at the

expanse of his back with her fingernails.  Her mouth is

locked on Blade's throat, then his is locked on hers.

Together they drink, leeching blood from one another.

PULLING BACK AGAIN

Nyssa clutching greedily at Blade like she never wants to let

go.  Her soul is gone -- transported to that place we drift

to when the euphoria overtake us and we're somehow able to

transcend the horror of our fleeting lives.

Finally, Nyssa GASPS, climaxing as she retracts her fangs

from Blade.  Her head rolls to the side as her pupil --

focused on nothing short of eternity -- dilate unnaturally

large.

LATER

Blade and Nyssa lie in each other's arms, awash in moonlight,

blissfully dead to the world until --

SOMETHING MAKES BLADE STIR

He sits up, listening.  Nyssa stirs beside him.  She moves to

speak but Blade holds up a hand, silencing her.  Together,

they slowly creep towards a nearby window where --

JARED NOMAK'S NIGHTMARE FACE

is pressed up against the icy glass, staring back at them!

Nyssa GASPS.  Blade draws back with a start.  But in the time

it takes to blink, Nomak is gone.  Just then, we hear a

NOISE.  Scud appears in a doorway, groggy.

MOMENTS LATER

Blade is at the computer workstation.  He activates the

footage of Nomak he was viewing earlier.  He fast-forwards to

a specific moment, then plays it back at normal speed.

Blade points to the screen, saying the words as Nomak

silently mouths them.

Nyssa shakes her head.

Blade spins, his MACH pistol up and ready to fire.  Whistler

sits on the opposite side of the room, watching them as he

smokes.

Whistler rises from his chair.  He flicks his cigarette butt

into the shadows and fixes Blade with a heavy stares.

Blade is still guarded, not yet ready to lower his MACH.

Blade looks to Nyssa, but she seems equally perplexed.

Whistler gives Nyssa a rueful stare, then tosses Blade a

research folder.  On the cover is the same red, double-helix

logo we saw at Damaskinos' facility.

Nyssa look to Blade, imploring.

EXT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - NIGHT

A high-tech, heavily guarded industrial complex nestled

within an expanse of unassuming wooded acreage overlooking

the ocean.

INT. DAMASKINOS' LAIR - NIGHT

Carter Stevens shuts down his computer workstation, then

moves to the heavy oak door, glancing at a medical chart as

he opens it.  When he looks up --

A fist PUNCHES Stevens in the face.

BLADE

Stands in the entry way.  Whistler is behind him, holding a

gun to Nyssa.  Scud is there, too.

Blade spins Stevens around, shoving his face against a glass

case, crushing the man's nose, spiderwebbing the glass.

Blade clamps his fingers around Stevens' broken nose and

twists it with a sickening CRUNCH.  Stevens SCREAMS, caving.

Blade releases him.  Stevens sinks to the floor, cradling his

brutalized face.

But Blade's not concerned about that now.  He's got something

more pressing on his mind.

ANGLE ON DAMASKINOS

Standing behind them.

INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - ELEVATED CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Damaskinos leads them down a corridor.

Damaskinos reaches to a nearby control panel, pressing a

button.  A pair of massive doors slide apart, revealing:

THE EUGENICS CHAMBER

We are in a vast, multitiered, temperature-controlled chamber

-- equal parts 21st century medical facility and Hammer House

of Horror.

A network of catwalks look down upon the circular chamber,

the center of which is dominated by a massive, steel cask,

which is in turn ringed by a safety railing.  The operation

looks not unlike a small-scale water purification plant, or

perhaps a futuristic distillery.  Only in this instance, the

liquid churning within the cask is HUMAN BLOOD.

TINY EMBRYOS

Each no bigger than a thumbnail, line the walls of the

chamber, preserved in credit card sized cryo-cases.  There

are thousands of them, resting atop one another in racks with

stretch from the floor on upwards.

As Damaskinos removes an embryo from the rack, we see ANOTHER

EMBRYO behind it.  That cryo-case now slides forward with a

WHIR, taking the place of the one which Damaskinos removed.

Like some kind of perverse vending machine.  God knows how

deep they're stacked.  If thousands are visible, there could

be tens of thousands in total.

Damaskinos holds the translucent cryo-case up to the light.

The Embryo within shudders, its tiny heart beating.

BOOM!  We hear the tread of HEAVY FOOTSTEPS approaching.  All

eyes turn towards a side corridor.

REINHARDT

enters from the shadows, holding Scud's rail-gun.  Much of

his face has been burnt away, leaving him with a ghastly

death's head mask of blackened muscle and exposed bone.

As Reinhardt aims the rail gun at Blade, a DOZEN VAMPIRE

GUARDS appear on the catwalks above, also taking aim.

Blade does his level best, pulling his MACH, squeezing off a

SHOT even as Reinhardt FIRES.  BA-BANG!  Blade is hit in the

side, spun clear around.  His shot goes wild, hitting one of

the Guards in the head, turning him to ash as Blade himself

falls to the floor.

Blade GASPS in shock.  The rail-gun needles have ripped a

brutal hole through the side of his chest-plate.  He clutches

at his flank, trying to staunch the blood that's seeping

between his fingers.  As he sits forward, we see MORE

FLECHETTES have embedded in the wall behind him, having torn

completely through him.

Whistler steps forward.  One of the vampire sentries LASHES

OUT, striking him in the face with the butt of his rifle.

Whistler sinks to his knees, stunned.  The guard disarms him.

ON BLADE

Gritting his teeth against the pain.  He reaches inside his

combat harness, pulling out the remote detonator for the

explosive flechette in Reinhardt's skull.

Scud crosses over to Reinhardt's side.  Whistler stares at

him in disbelief.

Blade's eyes darken with hatred.  Reinhardt laughs.

Reinhardt digs his claws into his scalp and tugs the barbed

flechette from his skull.  As he does so, Blade's remote

detonator BEEPS to indicate it's being tempered with.

Reinhardt finishes removing it and sighs contentedly.

Reinhardt tosses the fletchette to Scud, who grins, flipping

down his lower lip to reveal a vampire glyph tattooed on it.

Blade looks to Nyssa who averts her gaze.

Scud punches Whistler in the face.

Scud shakes his hand, which is smarting from the blow.  He

looks to Blade now, angry.

He pinches Blade's cheek.  Then he stands up.

Scud has a split-second of terrified, wide-eyed realization

before Blade pushes the button and BOOM!  The flechette in

Scud's hand EXPLODES, blowing his body apart, spraying those

nearest him with blood.  Primarily Reinhardt.

As the others react with varying degrees of surprise and

horror, Reinhardt savagely KICKS Blade across the face.  He

HITS Blade again and again, driving him down to the floor.

Then he bends and tugs the sword from Blade's back-scabbard,

preparing to cut his throat.

Reinhardt hesitates.  Nyssa takes a step towards Blade, but

Damaskinos stops her.  Damaskinos gestures to his guards.

They haul Blade up and drag him from the lab.  Reinhardt

gestures to Whistler.

Damaskinos waves dismissively.  Reinhardt takes Whistler

away.

INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - AUTOPSY ROOM - NIGHT

Blade is dragged into a large autopsy room.  The vampire

guards lay him on a steel autopsy table.  He struggles

against them, but he's just too weak from loss of blood.

Eventually they get him secured, clamping his wrists and

ankles into steel manacles which are affixed to the table.

INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT

CLOSE ON

Blade's sword pommel as the booby-trap blades in the handle

spring out.

PULL BACK to reveal Reinhardt holding Blade's sword.  He

gives it a few practiced swings, then runs his thumb along

the blade.

ON WHISTLER

Sitting in the corner, his hands cuffed behind his back.  We

are in a security station filled with surveillance monitors

offering various views of the laboratory complex.

Reinhardt KICKS Whistler in the face.

Whistler spits blood and glares up at Reinhardt.

INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - EUGENICS CHAMBER - NIGHT

Nyssa stands before the banks of vampire embryos, clearly

troubled.  Damaskinos regards her.

Damaskinos moves in close to her, running a finger along her

throat.  She doesn't acknowledge it.

Damaskinos slowly tightens his hand around Nyssa's throat.

Damaskinos releases Nyssa.  She falls, GASPING for breath.

He stares down at her with disdain, then exits.

INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - AUTOPSY ROOM - NIGHT

Damaskinos enters, followed by Carter Stevens.  The guards

remain posted at the main entrance of the room.  Damaskinos

approaches, looking down at Blade.

Blade stares back at him, still defiant, but fighting a

losing battle.  He's dying and he knows it.  His breathing is

shallow.  It's an effort just to keep his eyes open.

TWO SURGEONS snap on surgical gloves.  Stevens is enjoying

seeing Blade helpless.

Damaskinos is amused by Blade's seeming lack of concern.

Blade smiles, laughing tiredly.

Blade lifts up his hand, unfurling his previously closed

fist.  There is a deep gash in his palms.

Damaskinos stares at Blade's hand, then looks to the floor.

A line of blood droplets lead back to the doors through which

he entered.

A SERIES OF QUICK SHOTS

Various hallways, the helipad outside Caliban industries,

etc.  In rapid succession, we SEE more TRAILS OF BLOOD

DROPLETS.  Then, just as quickly, we are back --

INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - AUTOPSY ROOM - NIGHT

With Damaskinos and company.  Suddenly, the lights above them

flicker then go out.  As emergency lights kick on --

BANG!  BANG!BANG!BANG!  All eyes turn towards a steel

security door which is shuddering -- bulging and bending

inwards as Nomak throws himself against it.

Damaskinos looks to a bank of security monitors which are

flickering back to life now.  We see Nomak's blurred

silhouette from various angles, pummeling the door.  Then --

RIPPPPPP!!!  A portion of the door is clawed open and we see

a glimpse of Nomak's SNARLING FACE.

Damaskinos' eyes widen in terror as he stumbles backwards,

activating an ALARM.  He looks to the guards, SCREAMING.

Damaskinos runs for his life, rushing out the opposite door,

quickly followed by Stevens as we --

INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Nyssa hears the ALARMS and moves into a corridor lit by red,

strobing emergency lights.  VAMPIRE GUARDS are rushing past.

INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT

Reinhardt also hears the ALARMS.  He looks to the

surveillance monitors where he SEES Nomak.

Behind him, we see Whistler taking advantage of the

distraction.  He folds his legs up under him, working his

cuffed hands over his feet.  When Reinhardt spins back away

from the security monitors --

Whistler is GONE.  A steel grating in the floor lies half

open.  The obvious means of exit.

INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - AUTOPSY ROOM - NIGHT

As Nomak continues tearing down the autopsy door, BULLETS

hammer into his back.  He turns, sees a DOZEN GUARDS FIRING

at him, their gunfire chewing the shit out of the concrete

walls around him.  Nomak staggers, but doesn't go down as

CLEAR BLOOD sprays from the body hits.

INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - MAINTENANCE CONDUIT - NIGHT

Whistler shuffles forward through the narrow conduit on his

elbows.  We hear footsteps.  Through the metal gratings

above, we glimpse TWO FIGURES rushing past --

INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - ANOTHER CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Damaskinos and Stevens round a corner, spilling into several

GUARDS.  He shoves his fellow vampires aside.

INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - AUTOPSY ROOM - NIGHT

CLOSE ON a grate moving up from the floor.  Whistler emerges,

rushing to Blade's side.  As he starts frantically releasing

Blade from his bonds, he looks to the ravaged door --

WHISTLER'S POV (THROUGH THE V-SHAPED GAP IN DOOR)

Nomak savages the guards, flinging them into the air.  A

guard's body hits the V-gap in the door and obscures our view

as --

Whistler redoubles his efforts, finally freeing Blade.  He

helps him from the autopsy table.  Blade is sinking, starting

to fade.  Whistler slaps his face, shaking him.

INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - AUTOPSY ROOM HALLWAY - NIGHT

Carnage.  A frazetta painting come to life.  Nomak atop dead

guards, draining the last of his victims' blood.  He whips

his face in our direction and ROARS, charging the door --

INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - AUTOPSY ROOM - NIGHT

WHAM!  The door gives way and Nomak enters.  To the right, he

SEES Whistler and Blade exiting.  To the left, he SEES the

security monitors.  Damaskinos and Stevens can be glimpsed in

one of these monitors.

Nomak moves to the left.

INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - THIRD CORRIDOR - NIGHT

Blade clutches his bleeding side, staggering down the

corridor towards a door marked "Eugenics" with Whistler's

help.  By all rights, Blade should be dead.  But he continues

on, moving towards the door with determination.

INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - 4-WAY INTERSECTION - NIGHT

CLOSE ON a hand twisting a safety lever on the floor.  PULL

BACK to reveal Stevens manually activating a series of

hydraulic lock-down latches.

CHINK!CHINK!CHINK!  The doors of the Eastern, Northern, and

Western corridors are sealing, lock-down latches clamping

down for extra security.  Even as the Western door seals, we

glimpse Nomak rushing towards it with inhuman speed.

ON STEVENS

panicked, turning towards the open elevator cab where --

DAMASKINOS

is waiting.  But even as Stevens starts towards the elevator,

Damaskinos dispassionately presses the "CLOSE DOOR" button.

Stevens rushes towards the closing elevator doors, but it's

too late.  He pounds his fist against them.  Behind him, we

hear a terrible RENDING OF METAL as the Western door gives.

Stevens looks in that direction --

In an eyeblink, Nomak is upon him, SLAMMING his hand over

Stevens' face, crushing it.

INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - ELEVATOR CAB - NIGHT

As Damaskinos slides a security card through a reader and

punches in a code, a thin SPRAY OF BLOOD jets across his pale

forearm.  He looks to the elevator doors.  The spray of blood

is coming through the vertical door seal.  The metal doors

SHUDDER violently and then the cab begins to ascend.

Damaskinos retreats to the far corner of the elevator,

breathing a sigh of relief.

INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - EUGENICS CHAMBER - NIGHT

WHOOSH!  A pneumatic door slides open.  Blade and Whistler

enter.  They are on the second level now, up amongst the

catwalks.  Below them is the churning cask of purified blood.

They have almost reached the end of the catwalk when --

REINHARDT AND HIS MEN

converge on the lab from two directions at once.  Some of the

vampires spill through the door on the second level with

Reinhardt, while others enter on the ground floor.

As Reinhardt takes aim at Blade with the shotgun, the other

vampires FIRE.  Whistler is HIT in the leg.  He goes down,

CRYING OUT, then grips Blade's arm, shoving him onward --

ON BLADE

gripping the guard rail for support, dragging himself along.

Reinhardt fires.  A SHOTGUN BLAST hits Blade, grazing him but

otherwise missing him.  As Reinhardt curses and prepares to

fire again --

Blade makes it to the end of the catwalk, pitching himself

out into open space.  Time slows to a crawl as Blade tumbles

downward, plummeting into --

THE BLOOD CASK BELOW

Blade sinks from view, disappearing beneath the churning

slurry of crimson.  A beat passes as Reinhardt and his men

draw closer, apprehensive.  Then, an explosion of BLOOD

gushes over Reinhardt and the others.  They fall backwards,

blinded, slipping --

BLADE

surfaces from the cask in morbidly glorious slow-motion.

Think of Sheen in the end-sequence of Apocalypse Now, only

instead of a river of mud, Blade is covered head-to-toe in

crimson.  Majestic and glistening.  A primordial god.  He

rears back his head, letting loose a triumphal ROAR.

Reinhardt's men hesitate.  One look at Blade's eyes and we

can see he's tapped into a well-spring of fury even he never

knew he had.  The man is super-charged and ready for war.

Blade tears into the vampires, unleashing a blizzard of

martial arts moves.  He powers a right hook into the first

vampire's face, then pivots, launching a devastating spinning

back-fist into the face of a second.  At the same time, he

rips the second guard's security belt from his waist,

twirling it around nanchadku-style to blind a third guard and

capture the wrist of a fourth.

Some vampires FIRE their guns, but Blade is a whirlwind,

shifting and dodging.  BULLETS go wild, hitting circuitry,

EXPLODING APART cannisters of combustible chemicals.  In

seconds, FLAMES are licking across the laboratory floor.

Blade drops, causing a pair of vampires to FIRE their guns at

one another.

Then Blade knocks two more vampires onto their asses with a

foot sweep.  Then he's up again.  Slamming the bridge of a

fifth vampire's nose into his brain with a palm heel strike.

A snap kick, an overhand elbow strike, a knee stamp that

shatter's the vampire's knee cap.  An upward block, a jab, a

cross, a shin kick aimed at a vamp's quadriceps.

Overhand punches, rising punches, parallel punches, spinning

rear elbows, deep kicks, on and on and on and on in an orgy

of super-hero violence until --

WHAM!  Blade cuts the last of the vampire soldiers down,

turning from the creature's disintegrating body to face --

REINHARDT

The vampire mercenary clutches Blade's sword in his hand, but

the weapon provides him with little sense of security given

that he's just seen a dozen of his men slaughtered.  The

automatic sprinkler system is on now, spraying water down

upon Blade and Reinhardt alike.  Blade advances.

Reinhardt's been cornered.  There's nowhere else for him to

run.  Refusing to be cowed, Reinhardt SCREAMS and brings the

sword down at Blade's head when WHOOSH --

But Blade swings his hands upward, slapping them on either

side of the blade, trapping the sword on its downward arc.

Reinhardt strains, trying to tear the sword away from Blade's

grip.  The vampire's eyes widen in fear.  And during that

split-second in which the two men are frozen, connected by

the weapon which vibrates between them, Blade says:

TWHISH!  The sword twists free from Reinhardt's grasp,

spinning upward into the air.  Reinhardt stumbles backwards

against the blood cask railing as --

Blade catches the sword on its way down, swinging it around

in one fluid motion, slicing Reinhardt's torso in half, along

with a diagonal axis!  Reinhardt sinks to his knees as the

TWO HALVES split apart, turning to ash before they hit floor.

Beat.  Blade stands beneath the spray of the overhead

sprinklers, rinsing the blood from his body.  He turns

towards the exit, sword in hand.

INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - LOBBY - NIGHT

A set of elevator doors open, disgorging Damaskinos.  Beyond

the lobby windows we can SEE a waiting helicopter, VAMPIRE

SOLDIERS readying it for take-off.  Damaskinos rushes across

the lobby and is almost at the exit when --

CHUNK!CHUNK!CHUNK! A series of steel shutters slam down over

the doors and windows.  Damaskinos tries to tug one of the

shutters upwards, then moves to a keypad nearby.  He starts

hurriedly tapping in a numeric sequence when we hear:

Damaskinos spins around.  Nyssa stands behind him.  She's got

Whistler's rail-gun in her hands.

AS if in response, a GRINDING SHUDDER comes from the elevator

doors.  Damaskinos spins in wide-eyed horror, then --

BLADE

enters the lobby from a mezzanine above, sword in hand.

Damaskinos turns back to his daughter, making a last appeal.

WHAM!WHAM!WHAM!  Nomak pounds away.  The elevator doors are

starting to buckle, then they tear apart completely --

NOMAK

bursts into the lobby, ROARING.  If anything, he is even more

animalistic now, his features having become grossly

distorted.

Damaskinos scurries backwards, but there's nowhere left to

run.  Nomak descends on him, lifting the vampire into a rib

crushing embrace, chomping his elongated canines into

Damaskinos' throat.

Damaskinos SQUEALS like a child as his life-blood is sucked

out of him.  His body begins to cave inward, shrinking and

twisting until there's nothing left but shriveled husk.

Nyssa hefts the rail-gun and FIRES at Nomak's back.  Nomak

HOWLS, releasing Damaskinos' body, then turns, focusing his

blood-drunk gaze on Nomak.

But Nyssa stands her ground, rachetting back the slide on the

rail-gun, readying to unleash another barrage of needles.

Nomak CHARGES, moving at unbelievable speed.  She FIRES

AGAIN, aiming at Nomak's chest --

but then Nomak is upon her.  He slaps the rail-gun from her

hands, SMASHING IT TO PIECES.

Then he wraps his hand around her throat, pulling her

forward, sinking his teeth into her neck.  Nyssa SCREAMS.

ON BLADE

as he leaps from the mezzanine level, sword extended, like

Beowulf diving to slay Grendel.  He PLUNGES the sword deep

into Nomak's upper torso.  Then DRIVES it in even further --

Nomak releases Nyssa and back-hands Blade across the face,

sending him sailing through the air.  He lands, skids across

the floor --

ON NOMAK

stumbling backwards into the wall.  The sword has sunk so

deep that the tip is actually protruding out his back,

SCRAPING a gash across the wall as Nomak slides towards the

floor.

Nomak GRUNTS, then reaches for the pomeel with his ruined

hand.  He grips the pommel and SNAPS the sword-blade in half.

Then he SLAMS against the wall, forcing the half of the

broken blade that's still embedded in him out back through

the front of his chest.  As Nomak rises to his feet --

Blade is on him again, snap-kicking the Reaper in the chest.

Nomak retaliates.  Blade somersaults out of the way, then

springs back again, KICKING Nomak in the face, BREAKING

Nomak's NECK.  Nomak's head lolls unnaturally sideways for a

heartbeat and then Nomak swings his head around, somehow

righting his neck vertebrae with a snap of his head.

They trade blows, a brutal death-match that seems to defy

gravity.  Blade moves in for a round-house punch, but Nomak

catches his fist, holding it for a split-second, then bending

Blade's hand at an unnatural angle, SNAPPING his wrist bones.

The pain is enormous.

Nomak starts beating the living shit out of Blade, pummeling

him with his fists, gripped by an uncontrollable rage.  He

SMASHES Blade against a marble column, cracking it.  Then he

flings Blade against one of the brushed steel walls - so hard

that Blade's body actually leaves an indentation.

Before Blade can recover, Nomak is in front of him, launching

another kick.  Blade rolls his head out of the way, barely

avoiding Nomak's boot heel which dents the wall.  Nomak kicks

a second time.  Blade avoids Nomak, but third time's the

charm and Nomak lands one squarely in Blade's gut.

Blade falls beneath a flurry of blows, unable to defend

himself any longer.  Blood stains his eyes, obscuring his

vision.  He strikes out blindly, but Nomak has forced him to

the ground, pinning him there.  As Blade struggles to free

himself --

NOMAK

lowers his head towards Blade's face.  The scar/seam in

Nomak's chin splits open and Nomak's lower jaw flares apart,

distending and widening to reveal the awful, glistening hell

maw -- the hollow inner fangs and striated cartilage which

are closing about Blade's face.  Blade twists his head

violently to the right, then glimpses the broken tip of his

sword resting a few feet away.  He reaches for it in

desperation, plunging it up into Nomak's chest.  Nomak HOWLS.

Because the hilt has been broken off, Blade is forced to grip

the cutting edge of the weapon with his bare hands.  It

slices into his fingers --

but Blade just grips the broken sword tighter, ignoring the

pain, driving it deeper and deeper -- until, suddenly, it

penetrates the cartilaginous shell around Nomak's heart and --

Nomak smiles, covering Blade's hands with his own.  He looks

blade in the eye, then drives the broken sword home.

Nomak's body stiffens, his eyes grow unseeing, an oddly

serene look spreading across his tortured face.  A patch of

BLACKNESS begins radiating outward from his chest, moving

over his body, carbonizing him from within.  As his blackened

flesh begins to crack, BLUE FLAMES flicker out from the

fissures.  In seconds, Nomak is gone.

Beat.  Blade stands, exhausted.  Then he looks to where Nyssa

rests.  He moves to her side, kneeling beside her.  She

smiles up at him, bravely, but frightened all the same.

Blade inspects the wound on her neck.  It's clearly fatal.

Nyssa nods.  Blade has only confirmed her existing fears.

She grips Blade's arm, her eyes welling with tears.

Blade sighs.  The burden is all to familiar to him.

ON BLADE

his face a mask of sad resignation.  He lifts Nyssa into his

arms.  She closes her eyes, resting her head on his chest.

EXT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - JUST BEFORE DAWN

The shutters over the doors and windows slowly rise.  Blade

shoulders open the front door, moving across the lawn towards

a bluff overlooking the ocean.  A moment later, Whistler

emerges into the light, watching as Blade sets Nysa down on

the grass.  Her eyes flutter open and she looks into --

THE HORIZON

where the faintest glimmer of pre-dawn light brightens the

cloud-swept sky.  It's peaceful.  We can hear the SURF

crashing on the shore below.

Together they wait.

A GLIMMER OF LIGHT emerges over the earth's curvature,

spreading its dazzling radiance out across the skyline.

Nyssa's eyes widen in expectation, her breath catching.  She

looks up at Blade, stroking his face, smiling.

Blade nods, he's strong for her.  Despite his best efforts, a

tear slides down his cheek.  They kiss then as the sun rises

in full glory, flooding the world with its brilliance.

Blade holds Nyssa tightly to his chest, refusing to

relinquish his grip as her body catches fire.  The end is

blessedly quick -- not a slow-burn of blazing agony, but a

nearly seamless transition from life --

To ash...  Nyssa collapses apart in Blade's arms, billowing

out around him in a cloud of glowing embers.  One moment

she's there, the next she's gone.  Blade remains where he is,

kneeling on the bluff, the wind carrying the last traces of

Nyssa aloft into the sky.  He shuts his eyes.  Turns his face

to the warmth of the sun, surrendering himself to acceptance.

WE RISE UP

isolating Blade alone on the windswept bluff.  After a

moment, Whistler moves to Blade's side.  He rests a hand on

Blade's shoulder, but doesn't say a word.  We keep moving up

and up until the two of them are just a pair of tiny figures

on the rolling coastline.  Then we --

A SERIES OF CLOSEUPS

Images of a weapon being forged, all filtered through

shimmering convection waves of intense heat.  We SEE a HAMMER

CLANGING DOWN.  The FIRES of a ROARING furnace.  SPARKS

showering up from titanium slowly being given shape.  Molten

silver.  Acid etching.  And then we PULL BACK to reveal --

INT. BLADE'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

Blade works before a forge by moonlight, his body dripping

with sweat.  He slips his hand in a protective glove and

grips the red-hot weapon, dousing it in a quench bucket.  As

a cloud of steam envelops Blade, he lifts it up for view.

A NEW SWORD

perfect.  Lethal.  Wrought from titanium, plated in sliver.

As Blade inspects the sword, we hear his earlier words again:

Satisfied with his work, Blade smiles --

EXT. FUCKINGHAM PALACE - NIGHT

A shit-hole porno emporium offering the latest in bagged-for

your-pleasure Euro-raunch.

INT. FUCKINGHAM PALACE - NIGHT

Rush, the vampire brother wanna-be from the opening of the

film, is up at the register, exchanging a twenty for a

handful of tokens.  He's humming along to that old E-Rotic

song "Voulez-vous couchez avec moi".

We FOLLOW HIM down a hall lined with video booths, serenaded

all the while by the cheesy SYNTH SOUNDTRACKS and faked

ORGASMOGROANS coming from beyond the doors.

Rush stops at "Buddy Booth No. 3 - HOT ONE-ON-ONE ACTION."

INT. BUDDY BOOTH - NIGHT

Rush steps inside.  There's a chair set in front of a

Plexiglas window, an intercom with a phone receiver, box of

Kleenex, and a slot for the tokens.

Rush gets himself situated, picks up the receiver, then

eagerly pops some tokens in the slot.

With a HUM, the screen in front of the window rises, offering

us a view of the booth on the other side of the Plexiglas.

Only instead of a skanked out booth girl, Rush finds himself

staring in open-mouthed astonishment at --

BLADE

Who flashes an evil smile at us.

In a near blur, Blade draws his new sword from his back

scabbard and stabs it RIGHT INTO CAMERA, SMASHING apart the

Plexiglas window as we --
