Edmund Get Away from there! What do

you think you're doing?! Peter!

(grabs Edmund) Come on! To the shelter,

now!

(grabs things from next to her bed with

a flashlight, notices Lucy in bed) Lucy,

come on! Lucy!

Wait, dad!

Come on idiot (Throws Edmund onto the

ground and starts shouting) Why do you

always have to be so selfish! You only

think about yourself. Why can't you

ever do as you're told!

Attention, would all parents ensure

that their parents have the appropriate

identification papers.

You warm enough? Now honey you have

to keep this on you. Be sure and keep

this on.

If Dad were here, the war would be over,

and we wouldn't have to go

If dad wasn't fighting and the war was

over we wouldn't have to go.

You will listen to your brother, won't

you Edmund?

Look after the others

I will mum

You be a big girl now Susan,

There now... off you go.

Come on, we've got to stay together

now. Everything's going to be okay

Peter! (Susan Snatches papers)

I know how to get on a train

Bye Mom, we'll miss you

Good-Bye my darlings

The Professor knew we were coming?

Perhaps we've been incorrectly labeled?

Mrs. Macready?

I'm afraid so. Is that it then? Haven't

you brought anything else?

No, ma'am. It's just us.

Small favours.

The professor is unaccustomed to having

children in his house, and as such,

there are a few rules we need to follow.

There will be no shouting' or running',

no improper use of the dumbwaiter, NO

touching of the historical artifacts

and above all, there shall be no disturbing'

of the Professor.

German aircraft carried out several

attacks on Great Britain last night

The sheets feel scratchy

Wars don't last forever, Lucy. We'll

be home soon.

If home's still there.

Isn't time you were in bed?

YES, Mom!

ED!

Gas-tro-vas-cu-lar.

Is it Latin?

Yes...

Is it Latin for worst game ever invented?

We could play hide-and-seek

but we're already having so much fun!

Please, please, please.

One...two...three...four...

(pushes Lucy) Get out! I was here first!

Eight four, eighty five...

(Gasp)

AAAUUUGGGGHHHHH!!!

(slowly walking out as Lucy picks up

packages) Uh, CH... gk, ch (random noises)

Were you hiding from me?

Huh, um, n..n.. no, I..I... I didn't

want to scare you,

if you don't mind my asking...what are

you?

Why, I'm a faun! And you must be some

beardless dwarf?

I'm not a dwarf, I'm a girl! And actually

I'm tallest in my class.

But you're saying, you're a daughter

of Eve?

Well, my mum's name is Helen...

Yes, but you are, in fact, human.

Of course.

What are you doing here?

Well, I came in through the wardrobe

in the spare room, and-

Spare Oom, is that in Narnia?

Narnia? What's that?

My dear girl, you're in it!  Everything

from the lamp post, all the way to castle

Cair Paravel on the Eastern Sea, every

stick and stone, every icicle, is Narnia,

This is an awfully big wardrobe

I'm sorry, please allow me to introduce

myself, my name is Tumnus

Glad to meet you, Mr. Tumnus! *extends

hand* I'm Lucy Pevensie. Oh, you shake

it!

Why?

I-I don't know! People do it when they

meet each other.

Lucy Pevensie, from the shining city

of War Drobe in the far land of Spare

Oom, how would it be if you came and

had tea with me?

Oh! Well, thank you very much! But I

probably should be getting back...

Oh, come on! It's not every day I get

to make a new friend! And there's a...

roaring fire! And toast and cakes! And

maybe... we'll even break into the sardines.

Well, maybe for just a little while...

if you have... sardines.

By the bucket load,

Come Along.

Can I help you with that?

Why thank you!

Oh... That is my father.

He had a nice face. You look just like

him.

No, were not alike at all really.

My father is fighting in the war.

My father went away to war too... but

that was a very long time ago... before

this dreadful winter.

Winter isn't all bad. There's ice skating

and snow ball fights. Oh! And Christmas!

We haven't had Christmas in a hundred

years here.

(shocked) No presents for a hundred

years?

But, oh, you would have loved Narnia

in spring! The Dryads and the Fauns

would dance all night... but we never

got tired. And oh, the music! Such music.

Would you... like to hear some now?

yes please

(gets flute out) Now, are you familiar

with the Narnia lullabies?

(shakes her head): No, I'm afraid I'm

not

Good, because this probably won't sound

anything like one.

Oh I must go

It's too late for that now I'm such

a bad faun

No. You're the nicest faun I've ever

met.

Then I'm afraid you've had a very poor

sampling.

I'm sure you're very sorry, and you'll

never do it again.

It's not something I have done, Lucy

Pevensie. It's something I'm doing.

What are you doing?

I'm kidnapping you. It's the White Witch,

the one that makes it always winter,

and never Christmas. She told me that

I If I ever was to come across a son

of Adam or a daughter of Eve, I am supposed

to turn it over to her!

But I thought you were my friend

We must move quietly the woods are full

of her spies, even some of the trees

are on her side

I think so. (Tumnus starts to return

her handkerchief, but she gives it back)

Keep it, you need it more than I do.

Go...   Come on, go!

98, 99, 100... Ready or not here I come.

I'm back, I'm back, it's alright,

Shhh, he's coming.

You know, I'm not sure if you two have

quite gotten the idea of this game!

but weren't you wondering where I was?

That's the point! That's why he was

seeking you!

Does this mean I win?

I don't think Lucy wants to play anymore.

The only wood in here is the back of

the wardrobe.

One game at a time Lu, we don't all

have your imagination.

But I wasn't imagining!

that's enough

Well I believe you.

You do?

Yah, didn't I tell you about the football

field I found in the bathroom closet?

Why don't you just stop it, you always

have to make everything worse. Grow

up!

Shut up! You think you're dad, but you're

not! (storms out)

well, that was nicely handled! (walks

away too..)

It was really there...

Susan's right. That's enough..

Lucy, Lucy. I hope you're not afraid

of the dark (shuts door)

Lucy? Lucy! I think I believe you now!

Lucy?

Yah! (whipping sound)

What is it Ginarrbrik?

He won't let go!

Is that how you address the Queen of

Narnia?

I didn't know?

Well, you shall know her better afterwards.

Wait! What is your name Son-of-Adam?

Edmund, your majesty.

And how was it, Edmund, that you came

to enter my dominion?

I walked through a wardrobe following

my sister.

Your sister? How many are you?

four

Edmund you look so cold! Come and sit

with me here on my sledge. (Edmund joins

her) Now, would like something warm

to drink.

Yes...your majesty.(Take vial and drops

a green drop on snow that become a hot

drink that the dwarf gives Edmund) How

did you do that?

I can make anything you like.

Could you make me taller?

I can make anything you like to eat

Turkish Delight

I'd love to see your family

They're nothing special

I have no children of my own and you

are such a good little boy (I never

could hear those words right) where

I could see, one day, you becoming prince

of Narnia - maybe even king.

(mouth full) Really?

(nods) Of course you'd have to bring

your family.

They're nothing special

Oh, Peter will be king too?

No! But a king needs servants.

I-I guess I could bring 'em.

Beyond these woods, do you see those

two little hills? My house is right

between them. You'd love it there Edmund,

it has whole rooms simply stuffed with

Turkish Delight!

Couldn't I have some more now?

NO! (smiles) Don't want to ruin you

appetite.

I'm going to miss you Edmund. But we

are going to see each other soon.

I hope so.

Until then...dear one. (WW drives of

and Ed is left alone)

Edmund? Oh Edmund!!!! (hugs her brother)

I saw Mr. Tumnus again and he's fine!!!

The White Witch hasn't found out about

him helping me!

The White Witch?

She calls herself the Queen of Narnia,

but she really isn't. Edmund? Are you

okay? You look awful.

Well what do you expect! It's freezing!

How do we get out of here?

Come on...this way.

(turns on the light and jumps on Peter)

Peter, Peter wake up! It's there, it's

really there!

(rolls over still half asleep) Lucy,

what are talking about?

Narnia! It's all in the wardrobe, like

I told you!

Oh Lucy, you've been dreaming.

No I wasn't, I saw Mr. Tumnus again!

Oh, and this time - Edmund went too.

You saw the faun?

Well, he didn't actually go there with

me. What were you doing Edmund?

I-I was just playing along. You know

what little children are like these

days, they just don't know when to stop

pretending (sits on his bed looking

smugly at Lucy)

Ow!

You children are one shenanigan shy

of sleeping' in the stable- oh, Professor!

I told them you were not to be disturbed.

Oh, it's alright Mrs. Macready - I'm

sure there's a logical explanation.

But I think this one needs some hot

chocolate.

Yes Professor. Come on, dear.

*Ahem* (the two turn and follow him

into his office and the Professor sits

at his desk and takes some tobacco out

of it's silver apple case and puts it

in his pipe)

You seem to have upset the internal

balance of my housekeeper.

We are very sorry sir, it won't happen

again.

It's our sister sir, Lucy.

The weeping girl?

Yes sir, she's upset.

Hence the weeping

We can handle it! (takes Susan's sleeve)

Oh, I can see that.

She thinks she's found a magical land

in the upstairs wardrobe.

What did you say!?

The wardrobe upstairs, Lucy thinks she's

found a forest inside.

What was it like?

Like talking to a lunatic!

No, not her - the forest!

You're-you're not saying you believe

her?

No, not her - the forest!

You....you actually believe her?

Well don't you?

Well, logically it couldn't possibly

be there!

What do they teach at these schools?

Edmund said they were only pretending

And he's the more truthful one is he?

No, this would be the first time.

Well then, id your sister isn't lying

and isn't mad then logically we must

assume that she is telling the truth.

She's your sister, isn't she? You're

a family! It's high time you start acting

like one!

Peter winds up, goes for the bowl!

Ow!

Whoops! Wake up, Dolly Daydream!

Can't we play hide and go seek again?

I thought you said that it was a kid's

game.

Besides, we can all use the fresh air.

Not like there's air inside

Are you ready then?

Are you? (smacks his bat on the ground

and gets ready to hit the ball)

Well done, Ed!

You bowled it!

Listen, Mrs. Macready is coming

Run!

(runs to the wardrobe and opens the

door) Come on!

You have got to be joking.

Go!

Get back!

Impossible!

Don't worry, it's probably just your

imagination

I don't suppose saying we're sorry would

quite cover it?

No, it wouldn't. But this might!

Ow! (rubs his arm) Stop it! (They all

realize that Ed lied)

You little liar!

You didn't believe her either!

Apologize to Lucy. (He just looks at

her)

Say you're sorry! (Peter steps up to

him)

Alright! I'm sorry.

That's alright, some little children

just don't know when to stop pretending.

(looks at him smugly)

(mutters): Very funny.

Maybe we should go back

Can't we at lease take a look around?

I think Lucy must decide!

I all want you to meet Mr. Tumnus!

Well Mr. Tumnus it is (walks into the

wardrobe again)

We can't just walk around in these clothes!

(comes out) We can use these coats.

Peter, they don't belong to us.

Well I don't think the professor will

mind. And if you think about it logically

we are not even taking them out of the

wardrobe. (Hands coat to Edmund)

But that's a girl's coat!

I know.

...and tea and... (Sees open door and

runs off)

LUCY!

Who would do something like this?

Peter what is that on the wall?

The Former occupant of these premises,

the Faun Tumnus, is under arrest and

awaiting his trial on a charge of High

Treason against her imperial Majesty

Jadis, Queen of Narnia, Chatelaine of

Cair Paravel, Empress of the Lone Islands,

also to comforting her said Majesty's

enemies, harbouring spies and fraternizing

with Humans. signed Maugrim, captain

of the Secret Police, Long live the

Queen.

Now we should really go.

But we have to help him!

It's out of our hands now Lu.

You don't get it do you? I'm the human!!!

He helped ME!

Maybe we should call the police

These are the police!

Besides, he's a criminal!

Don't worry Lucy, we'll think of something

Psst!

Did that bird just 'psst' us?

It's a beaver.

Here, boy *clicks* come here...*clicks*

Well, I ain't gonna smell it if that's

what you want!

It's a talking beaver!

Lucy Pevensie?

Yes?

This is the handkerchief I gave to Mr-

Tumnus. He gave it to me just before

they took him.

Is he alright?

Further in.(Mr. Beaver scurries off,

Susan grabs Peter by the arm)

Peter, we don't know what you are doing.

She's right. How do we know we can trust

this beaver?

He say's he knows the faun.

He's a beaver...he shouldn't be saying

anything!

Is everything alright?

Yes. We were just talking

That's better left for safer corners.

He means the trees.

There is home sweet home.

Oh, what a beautiful dam Mr. Beaver.

Merely a trifle.

Is that you Beaver? I find out you've

been out with Badger again I'll...Oh,

they're not Badgers. I never thought

I would see this day

I would have given you a week if I thought

it would help (hee hee)

Well you must be cold and hungry. Let's

get you inside for some food and civilized

conversation.

Enjoying the scenery, are we?

Fish and sticks, dear.

is there nothing we can do about Mr.

Tumnus?

well.. there's hope!

Yeah, there's a load full of hope...

Aslan is on the move.

Who's Aslan?

Aslan....you silly little blighter.....you

don't know do you?

Well we haven't actually been here very

long

He's only the king the whole wood, the

true king of Narnia.... and he's waiting

for you!

waiting for us?

You got to be joking! Look, Aslan's

return, Tumnus' arrest.....the secret

police! They're all happening because

of you!

You're blaming us?

Not blaming you dear, thanking you.

There's....a prophecy, When Adam's flesh

and Adam's bone sits in if Cair Paravel

in throne the evil is over and done.

You know that doesn't really rhyme.

I know, but you're missing the point!

It's long been told that two sons of

Adam and two daughters of Eve will appear

to defeat the White Witch, and restore

peace to Narnia.

And you think we're the ones???

Well you'd better be, Aslan's already

fitted out your army!!!

I think you've made a mistake; we're

not heroes!

We're from Finchley!

I think it's time we were going.

But what about Mr. Tumnus?

Sorry Lucy. It's out of our hands.

Thank you for your hospitality.

Ed, time to go- Ed? (looks around the

room) I'm going to kill him.

You may not have to...Has Edmund been

to Narnia before?

Hurry up!

(shouting) Edmund!

Shh! They'll hear ya!

Get off me!

We just can't let him go!

Don't you get it?! He's the bait! She

wants all of ya in there!!! To kill

ya!

This is all your fault! None of this

would have happened if you had just

listened to me in the first place!

So you knew this would happen?

I didn't know what would happen...

Stop, this fighting isn't going to help

Edmund

She's right. Only Aslan can save him

now.

Then take us to him.

Stand still stranger!

I'm a Son of Adam, I met the Queen in

the woods!

My apologies, fortunate favourite of

the queen - or perhaps not so fortunate.

Wait here (Edmund sees the glorious

throne, and sits on it longingly. Then,

the witch comes up behind him and says,

scaring him half to death.)

You like it!

(he jumps up startled) Ye... yes, your

majesty!

I thought you might

Tell me, you sisters, are they deaf?

No

and your brother, unintelligent?

Well I think so, but mom says...

Then how dare you come alone! Edmund,

I ask so little of you

They just don't listen to me!

Couldn't even do that!

I...I did bring them half way. There

at the dam at the house of the beaver's!

Well...I guess your not a total lost

then.

Is there any chance I may have some

more Turkish delight now?

Ginnabrick, our guest is hungry

This way...for your num nums...

Maugrim!!!! You know what to do....

Take them

Hurry Mum, they are after us!

right then...

What is she doing?

Don't worry, you'll thank you me later.

it's a long journey and a beaver gets

cranky when he's hungry.

I'M CRANKY NOW!

Do you think we should bring jam?

Only if the Witch has toast.

This should lead to Aslan's

I thought it lead to your mums!

They're in the tunnel!

You should have brought a map!

There was no room next to the jam!

He was my best mate! (cries)

What happened to them?

This is what happens to the enemies

of the White Witch.

Stand still there traitor.

Relax, I'm one of the good guys

Well you look mighty like one of the

bad guys.

An unfortunate family resemblance, but

we can discuss family breeding later

right now we need to move.

What do you suggest?

Evening gents, Did we lose something?

Don't patronized me, I know where your

allegiance lies. We are looking for

some humans

Humans in Narnia, now that's some valuable

information

Where are they?!!!

They , they , were heading North.

Quickly, smell them out.

are you all right?

Well, I wish I could say their bark

was worse than their bite.

Stop squirming! You're worse than beaver

on bath day

Worst day of the year

Well I am afraid that is all the healing

I have time for.

You're leaving?

It has been a pleasure my Queen. I have

been asked by Aslan HIMSELF to gather

more troops.

You've seen Aslan!

What is He like?

Like everything we have ever heard.

He'll be a good help fighting the White

Witch

We are not planning fighting any witch

Surely King Peter...

We just want to get our brother back.

Are you gonna eat that? (from the other

prison)

Mr... Tumnus.

Your Lucy Pevensies brother.

I'm Edmund!

You have the same nose.

Is your sister alright? (no answer)

Is she safe?

I... I don't know!

My wolves tore that dam apart, your

little family was nowhere to be found.

(Lifts Edmund off the ground) Where

are they?!

I don't know..

Then you are no longer any use to me...Guard

Wait they said something about Aslan

Aslan! Where?

Stranger has only been in Narnia a short...(Hit

in head)

I left before I could hear anymore...I

wanted to see you again.

Guard!

Yes, your majesty

Release the Faun (Guard hit chains and

Tumnus cries out in pain as they drop

him by the Witch) Do you know why you

are here?

Because I believe in a free Narnia

You're here because he (points at Edmund)

turned you in...for sweeties. (turns

to dwarf and guard) Take him (Tumnus)

upstairs and ready my sleigh, Edmund

misses his family.

Now Aslan's camp is just over there

by the stone table just across the frozen

river.

River?

It's been frozen for 100 years

It seems so far

It's the world dear, did you expect

it to be small?

Smaller...

Whenever you are ready Son-of-Adam.

Come on, before we're old

If he tells me to Hurry up one more

time I'm going to turn him into a big

fluffy hat

Hurry up Son-of-Adam! We don't have

all day.

He is getting kinda bossy

It's her! Run!

Maybe she's gone.

I'll go and have a look

No, you're no good to Narnia dead.

Neither are you Beaver.

Thanks dear.

AHHH!....

AHHH!

I hope you've been good, because there

is someone here to see you.

Merry Christmas, Sir!

It certainly is, Lucy. Thanks to you.

I thought there was no Christmas in

Narnia.

It hasn't been for a hundred years.

But now the Witch's power is crumbling.

(he goes to his bag and throws it to

the ground)

Presents!

Lucy, Eve's Daughter. These are for

you. The juice of the fire flower. If

you, or one of your friends are wounded,

one drop of this cordial will restore

them. And though I do not expect you

to use it, this.

Well, I think I could be brave enough.

I'm sure you could. But battles are

ugly affairs. Eve's Daughter, Susan.

Trust in this bow, for it does not easily

miss.

What happened to, 'battles are ugly

affairs?'

And, though you don't seem to have trouble

making yourself heard, this. When you

put this horn to your lips and blow

it, wherever you are, help will come.

Thanks.

And, Peter. These are tools, not toys.

The time to use them may be soon at

hand.

Bare them well! I best be off, winter

is almost over and things do pile up

when you've been gone a thousand years.

Long live Aslan! (he gets in his sleigh

and rides off)

Bye... Merry Christmas!

Told you he was real!

Did you hear what he said... winter

is almost over. You no what that means...

no more ice!

Wait, maybe we should think about this.

We don't have time.

I was just trying to be realistic

No, you're trying to be smart...as usual!

Wait, maybe I should go first.

Maybe you should.

You've been sneaking second helpings

haven't you?

Well you never know what meal is gonna

be your last, especially with your cooking.

if mum knew what we were doing...

Mum's not here!!!

(sees wolves) Oh no!

Run!!!!!

Put that down boy, someone might get

hurt.

(pinned down) Don't worry about me!

Slit his throat!

Leave now while you can, and you're

brother leaves with you.

Stop Peter, maybe we should listen to

him!

Smart girl.

Don't listen to him. Kill him. Kill

him now!

Look, just because some man in a red

suit hands you a sword doesn't make

you a hero! So just drop it!

No Peter! Narnia need ya!

What's it gonna be Son of Adam? We're

not going to wait for ever. And neither

is the river.

PETER!!!!

Hold onto me!

What have you done?!

Lucy!

Has anyone seen my coat?

Your brother has you well looked after.

I don't think you'll be needing those

coats any more!

It's so warm here! (Cold look from Witch)

I think I'll go check the sleigh.

We found the traitor (Carrying the Fox)

He was gathering troops near the sharwood

forest.

Nice of you to drop by. I understand

you were so helpful to my wolves last

night.

Forgive me your majesty

Don't waste my time with flattery.

Not to seem rude, but I wasn't actually

talking to you (Looks at Edmund)

(Looks first to Edmund and than at Fox)

Where is ASLAN! Answer me! (About to

hit him with wand)

Wait! The Beavers said something about

the Stone Table and an army.

Thank you Edmund. It is good for this

creature to see some honesty before

he dies..

NO!(Fox to stone and White Slaps Edmund

across face)

Think who's side you are on. MINE...(turns

his head) Or theirs? If it is a war

Aslan wants (turns butterfly to stone)

It's a war he shall get.

Why are they all staring at us?

Maybe they think you look funny.

Oh stop your fussing Mrs. Beaver. You

look lovely.

(To Oreius) We have come to see Aslan.

Welcome Peter Adam's son, Welcome Susan

and Lucy daughters-of-Eve. Welcome Beavers.

fourth.

That's why we are here.

We had a little trouble along the way.

He's been captured by the White Witch

Captured!

He betrayed them your Excellence!

Then he has betrayed us all

Peace Oreius.

It is my fault really. I was too hard

on him.

We all were.

Sir, he's our brother.

I know dear and that makes the betrayal

all the worse. It may be harder than

you think

That is Cair Paravel of the four thrones

one of which you must sit as High King.

(...)

You doubt the prophecy

No, that's just it...you're not who

I think I am

Peter Pevensie formerly of Finnchley.

Beaver also said you wanted to turn

him into a hat.

I don't think I will be able.

You were able to get your family here.

Not all of them.

I will do what I can for Edmund. I too

want my family safe.

Mother hasn't had a dress like this

since before the war

Maybe we had bring back a whole trunk

load when we go home.

If we go home...Sorry I guess I am like

that. Remember when we use to have fun?

Yes, before you go boring.

Oh really (Splashes water and this continues

as Susan goes to get towel and...)

Now, We're very tired. We'd prefer to

kill you quickly.

Peter and Aslan

Susan and Lucy

Peter... no!

Follow him! He'll lead you to Edmund.

Peter, clean your sword.

Rise, Sir Peter Wolfsbane--Knight of

Narnia.

The Minotaurs on the left, send in the

dwarfs first.

You're not going to kill him?

Not yet! We have work to do (turning

to Otmin)

EDMUND!

What's done is done. There is no reason

to bring up the past with your brother.

Hello...

Oh, Edmund (Hugs him and Susan does

too)

How are you feeling?

I'm feeling kinda tired

Get some rest...and Edmund try not to

wander off again.

Narnia isn't going to run out of toast

Edmund

then you better pack some for the journey

So were going home?

You are, I promised I'd keep you three

safe but there's no reason I can't stay

and help.

but they need us...All four of us

Lucy it's too dangerous. You almost

drowned, Edmund was almost killed!

Which is why we have to stay.

I've seen what the White Witch can do

and I've helped her do it, and we can't

leave these people behind to suffer for it.

Well I guess that's it then. *gets up*

Where are you going?

(picks up bow and quiver) To get in

some practice.

Come on Ed, sword hand up like Oreius

showed us.

Whoa horsey!

My name is Philip.

Oh, sorry

you better come quick the White Witch

has requested a meeting with Aslan...

Jadis.. Jadis!!!

You have a traitor in your midst, Aslan.

His offence was not against you.

Have you forgotten the Deep Magic?

Do not cite the Deep Magic to me, Witch.

I was there when it was made.

Then you will know that the boy belongs

to me. (turns to crowd) That boy (points

to Edmund) will die on the Stone Table.

Come and take it then.

You think that a simple threat will

deny me my right, little king? Aslan

knows that if I do not have blood as

the law demands, all of Narnia will

be overturned, and perish, in fire and

water.

Enough, I shall talk with you alone.

The Witch has denounced her claim on

Edmund

How will I know your promise will be

kept?

Susan!

Aren't you suppose to be in bed?

We couldn't sleep

Please, Aslan. Couldn't we come with

you?

I would be glad of the company tonight.

It is time. From now on, I must go on

alone. Thank you Susan. Thank you Lucy.

And farewell.

(later after lots of jeers towards Aslan

as he walks to the Stone Table) Why

doesn't he fight back?

Bind him. Wait. First let him be shaved.

Tonight, the Deep magic will be appeased,

but tomorrow, we will take Narnia, Forever!

You know, Aslan, I'm a little disappointed

in you. Did you really think that by

giving your life you would save the

Human boy? Ha. You are giving up your

life, and saving no one. So much for

love.

In that knowledge... Despair... and

DIE!!!!!!

The great cat is DEAD!!

General, gather your army and prepare

for battle. However short it may be.

It's too late. He's gone. I'm sure he

knew what he was doing.

We have to go.

We can't just leave him here.

Lucy there's not time. We have to tell

the others.

The Trees

Fear not my princes. I come with tidings

of grave news..

It is true, he's gone

Then you'll have to lead us. There's

a whole army out there waiting to follow

you.

I can't

Aslan believed you could. And so do

I.

what are your orders?

They come, you highness, in numbers

and weapons far greater then our own.

Numbers do not win a battle

No, but I bet they help

I take no interest in prisoners. Kill

them all

Look to the sky

Are you with me?

To the death!

FOR NARNIA, AND FOR ASLAN!!!!

We should go.

I'm so cold.

Susan!

What have they done?

ASLAN!

We saw the Witch, the knife.

If the Witch knew the true meaning of

sacrifice, she might have interpreted

the Deep Magic a little differently.

For she would know that if a willing

victim who had committed no treachery

died in a traitors stead, the Stone

Table would crack and death itself would

begin to unwind.

We sent the word that you were dead.

Peter and Edmund would have gone to

war.

(draws knife) We have to help them.

We will, but not alone. Now, climb on

my back. We have a long ways to go and

little time to get there. And you might

want to cover your ears. ROAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Fall back! Draw them to the rocks!

That's the signal! Get ready!

FIRE!

Stop!

Susan this is...

MR TUMNUS!!!!

Come, lets search the castle - others

may still be trapped inside and Peter

will need all the help he can get.

Ed! There are too many of them! Go!

Get out of here! Get the girls, and

get them home!

Come on, you heard him!

Peter said to go!

Peter's not King yet!

Edmund!!(silenced)

Impossible!

It is finished.

Where's Edmund?

Edmund! (shoots arrow, kills the dwarf)

When are you ever going to do are you're

told?

Bring forth the crowns!

(As they put on her crown) To the glistening

eastern sea, I give you Queen Lucy the

Valiant. To the great western woods,

(puts his crown on) King Edmund the

Just. To the radiant southern sun, (puts

crown on) Queen Susan the Gentle. (crown

put on) And to the clear northern skies,

King Peter the Magnificent. Once a king

or Queen of Narnia, always a king or

queen.

Long live King Peter! Long live Queen

Susan! Long live King Edmund! And long

live Queen Lucy!

We'll see him again.

When?

In time...you mustn't press him, He

isn't a tame lion...

No, but he's good...

Here (pulling a hankie from his person)

I think you need this more than I do.

You alright there Philip?

Not as young as I used to be?

Come on Ed.

Just catching my breath

What did he say, Susan?

You girls stay at the castle, I'll go

get the stag myself.

What is this? (they get off their horse)

It seems like a dream...

Or a dream of a dream...Spare Oom

Not again

Come on

She always running off

These aren't branches...

There coats (Voices start to change)

Stop pushing...ah.... (Wardrobe door

flies open and all four fall on floor,

the door to the room opens and the professor

walks in with the ball)

There you are. Now what were children

doing the wardrobe?

You wouldn't believe us if we told you

(Professor throws ball to Peter and

with a twinkle in his eye...)

Try me

I don't think you'll get back in that

way...you see I've already tried.

Will we ever go back?

I expect so, probably when you least

expect it. What's to say Keep your eyes

open (They walk out the room and the

wardrobe door opens a crack and a light

and smoke come out and we hear a roar)
