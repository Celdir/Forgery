The Old Man takes a sip. He doesn't move. There is no

movement except for a whisper of steam rising from the coffee

pot.

The Old Man smiles.

Spooner shifts his weight.   Agitated.

Robertson smiles.   Pretends to instruct his people.

LAUGHTER.

A prematurely graying MAN leaning against the wall.    Nods

hello.

Alfred Lanning, only one there in a tie.   Nods.

A palpable wave of tension shoots through the group.

Robertson waves him off.

Everyone looks down at the other end of the table. A BEAT.

Then an attractive young WOMAN gets to her feet. SUSAN

CALVIN. Hair tucked behind her ears. Looking at everyone

but Spooner.

Calvin turns. Finally meeting Spooner's eye.      As if the

answer's obvious.

Spooner throws a look around the room.   Then back at Calvin.

Robertson responds to Spooner's skepticism.

Spooner.   Cocking his head to look at Hogenmiller's face.

Spooner.   Stands.   Pointing down at Hogenmiller.

And steps over the body, leaving a confused Baldez.

Stepping deeper, into the lab. Calvin. Following.

They pass half a robot, hanging from a hook. Spooner curls

his lip. Swivels the robot's head so it's not looking at

him.

Calvin.   Gently swivels the robot's head back to where it had

been.

Spooner. Studies her for a beat. Then turns back to the

body. Two CORONERS entering with a high-tech body box.

The coroners.   Start loading the body into the box.

VICTOR appears on a wall-sized SCREEN broken up into beehive-

like components.

AS WE WATCH THE SCREENS. The elevator opens and DOCTOR

HOGENMILLER steps into the metal corridor. In countless

ANGLES. High, low, close-up, wide. Hogenmiller's face

composed but tight.

Spooner watches the lab doors open to admit him.   Hogenmiller

steps in. The doors slide closed behind him.

Nothing for a few moments. Then a muffled GUNSHOT. Calvin

jumps, startled. That's it. The cameras, still trained on

the corridor.

A hundred-plus screens all FAST-FORWARD. POLICE OFFICERS

appear and force open the doors. Now TECHNICIANS appear

and rush through in a blur...

On screen, we see Spooner and Calvin enter the lab.

24   INT. HOGENMILLER'S LAB - DAY                                 24

Spooner startles. As the metal bug scurries through the

corridors. Clamps his hand down on it.

Spooner approaches a MOUND of ROBOT PARTS. Arms and legs.

Half torsos. All tossed haphazardly onto the pile.

Spooner. Starts nudging the pile with his shoe.   Calvin,

growing impatient...

WHEN SUDDENLY

The PILE ERUPTS in front of Spooner...Parts flying...AS A

ROBOT LEAPS UP FROM BENEATH IT!...

Spooner...knocked back...his GUN...skittering across the

floor...right to...

CALVIN'S FEET.

Calvin. Stunned.    Speechless. The Robot. Fixing his

ILLUMINATED EYES.   Right on her. She steps forward...

Spooner. Scrambling towards his gun.     Calvin.    Reaching out

towards the Robot...

Spooner.   Grabbing up his gun and wheeling round just as...

And the Robot.   Suddenly FREEZES.

Spooner. Heart POUNDING. Gets to his feet.         Training the

gun on the Robot. Calvin turns to him.

Spooner. Steeping closer to the Robot. Cautiously.

Holstering his gun. As Calvin turns for the door.

...THE ROBOT'S HAND SUDDENLY SHOOTS OUT...grabbing Spooner's

gun...from his holster...LIGHTENING FAST...pointing it...

right back at him...

CLOSE ON Calvin.   Cannot believe this is happening...

Calvin's voice.   Cracking from desperation.    Confusion.

Spooner. Staring into the Robot's eyes. A thin bead of

SWEAT. Trickling down his temple. Calvin. Moving away from

the door...

The Robot. Starts backing towards the door. The gun.

Shaking in its hand. As if he's desperate. Conflicted. He

touches the WALL PANEL. The doors slide open. The Robot

steps out into the metal corridor. Turning to RUN as the

doors begin to shut...

Spooner. Reaching down to whip out a BACK-UP GUN.     From an

ankle holster. Slapping in a LARGE CARTRIDGE.

Starts running for the door.

SLAMS the wall panel and...

Spooner. Cocking his gun.   A soft DING!    Announcing the

elevator car's arrival.

SECURITY, all crouching down in unison.    Weapons brought

round to position.

Spooner. Weaving through them.   Gun pointed at the metal

doors as...

WHOOSH. They slide open. Revealing a ROBOT. Standing

under the LIGHT. Holding a GUN. It steps out as Security

takes aim and...

Spooner pushes past them to the Robot.    Looks down at its

leg. UNSCATHED.

Looking wildly around. Goddammit. Bounds towards an EXIT as

Calvin steps forward to question the robot.

SPOONER. Running towards the exit.    Hears the answer.

Echoing behind him...

Calvin.   Tucking her hair behind her ears.

Spooner, looks down at this small woman.      Narrows his eyes.

101 robots answer in unison.    Their mechanical VOICES

resounding:

They share a look. Clearly not an option.      Then.   Calvin.

Gets an idea. Turns to Spooner...

...and GRABS his GUN from his holster.   He jumps back.

Their eyes lock.   Spooner, getting what she's doing.

She raises the gun to Spooner's head.    Hand, unsteady.

Calvin.    Swallows.   Looks over at the robots.   Then COCKS the

gun...

AND THE ROBOTS COME THUNDERING TOWARDS THEM. Like a row of

linebackers. Arms straight out. Their footsteps DEAFENING.

Coming CLOSER and CLOSER...

When CALVIN. Lowers the gun. The Robots. All stop in

unison. Immediately returning to their resting positions.

Spooner and Calvin stare out. EVERY ONE OF THE ROBOTS MOVED.

Standing right in front of them, like metal statues.

Spooner.    Has had enough.   Takes the gun back from Calvin...

...And BAM! Blows the head off of the nearest Robot.       Its

body crumples to the ground.

Calvin. Cannot believe what he just did.     Rushes over to the

destroyed Robot.

Spooner walks down the row, holding his gun in plain view.

FROM THE CONTROL BOOTH the Night Foreman screams over the

Spooner wings a FILE onto the table. It comes to a stop near

the Robot. The Robot, lifts one of its hands. Gently

resting its metal fingers on top of the file. Then opens it.

A stack of PICTURES.     HOGENMILLER'S CORPSE.

The Robot's emotionless face studies the grim images.

Nothing.

The Robot.   Looks up at Spooner.

The Robot slowly closes the file and slides it back across

the table. Spooner. Crosses his arms.

Still nothing.

And for a moment, Spooner is shocked. You can see it in his

eyes. He sits back in his chair. Forcing a tight smile.

SUDDENLY the Robot SLAMS its metal hands down on the table.

Spooner flinches.   Slightly.

The Robot doesn't respond.

Sonny shakes his head.    Faster and faster.   Getting upset.

Spooner.    Throws up his arms...

No one expected this.    Least of all Spooner.    He turns to

Toller.

JUST THEN the door opens.    Everyone turns as Calvin enters.

Spooner looks surprised.

Calvin crosses to the podium. A SPEAKER asking:

A pause.   Then the muted WHIR as Sonny turns to him.

Spooner. Momentarily stumped. As a VAN from U.S. ROBOTICS

pulls up. The back door dropping open. An ENGINEER motions

to the Robot.

Spooner.   Watching him step into the van.

Sonny sits down. With an almost human melancholy.   The

Engineers, securing him in place.

The Engineers start to close the doors. But Spooner reaches

out to stop them. Sonny. Looks over at him.

As CLANG! The van door CLOSES. Spooner, stepping back.

Something. Just not right. Lieutenant Bergin comes up

beside him.

Spooner looks at him.   There's no way he's giving himself a

break.

Spooner moves deeper into the apartment.   Everything.

Automated. Computerised. Cold...

Calvin laughs.   Can't believe what she's hearing.

He pulls out the PHOTO of Calvin and Hogenmiller. Calvin.

Blanching at the sight of it. Spooner tosses it down.

Calvin.   Looking down at the photo.   Swallows.

Spooner.    Locking eyes with her.

Calvin. Blinks. Trying, to stick to her resolve. Heads

over to the door. Spooner. Looking around the condo.

Calvin.    Opening the door.

Spooner. Looks at her.     Then heads out the door.   Calvin

SLAMS it behind him...

The SOUND...of the SLAM...REVERBERATING...and we...

go, falling right onto him. Knocking the gun from his hand.

Spooner. Crashes to the ground. As another ROBOT. Suddenly

appears above him. Its FINGERS made up of NEEDLES...as it

closes in on him...

Spooner. Despite himself. Looks down at the DRAWING -- a

charcoal sketch of moody abstract FIGURES. Inhabiting a

stark landscape. A strangely-shaped STRUCTURE to one side.

Concentric circles, throughout.

Spooner shifts his weight.   Uncomfortable with what Sonny's

saying.

Spooner.   Exchanging a look with Calvin.

Sonny.   Suddenly pleased.

Spooner.    Drops the drawing on the table.

Spooner, reaching into his pocket...

...When Sonny's HAND. Suddenly reaches out.       To stop him.

Cocks his head, for a moment.

Spooner. Confused. Looks over at Calvin. Why did he stop

him? JUST THEN. They hear FOOTSTEPS. Approaching the door.

VICTOR.    Suddenly appearing over the table...

The CELL DOOR. Slides open. And a pissed LANNING steps

inside. Shoots a withering glare. At Calvin.

Sonny.    Folds up the drawing.

Sonny leans in to hand it to Spooner.    Lowering his voice...

Robertson.   Walks across the Spooner.   Looks him.   Right in

the eye.

He looks back at Spooner and smiles.     That charismatic

Robertson we saw before.

The Hologram just lifts its cup.

For the first time, the Hologram pushes back its chair and

STANDS UP. Surprised, Spooner watches as it starts walking

towards him...

The interior of the COFFEE CUP, visible. It's empty. No

coffee. Our POV as we travel INSIDE THE CUP through

electronic snow...

A RECORDING BEGINS.   The real Dr. HOGENMILLER standing inside

his LABORATORY:

Hogenmiller continues.    With great emotion.

His expression darkens.   His tone, ominous.

Spooner looks up as an overhead LIGHT shines down.

Spooner reacts.   Wants to hear about Calvin:

Under the light a small DRAWER slides open.     Spooner looks.

A thin DATA STICK is inside. He takes it.

Hogenmiller SIGHS, as if there is so much more to say.     He

holds up a metal NAMEPLATE. The one Spooner found.

Spooner. Quickly searching his pocket.    Taking out the

ACTUAL NAMEPLATE. S.O.N.N.Y.

The voice stops and Spooner looks up. The Hologram.      Sitting

back at the end of the table drinking coffee.

He reaches into his pocket.      Pulling out the METAL S.O.N.N.Y.

NAMEPLATE. Holds it up.

Sonny.   Cocking his head.     Reading the nameplate.

Calvin takes the nameplate.

They both.   Turn to Sonny.    And at the same time:

Calvin maneuvers a chair behind the Robot.       Sonny plops down.

Shifting nervously.

Calvin locates that SLIT. At the base of Sonny's neck.

Slides the nameplate into it and SNAPS it into place. Steps

back.

Nothing. Sonny. Looking back and forth. Between Calvin.

And Spooner. A few more seconds. Tick by. Until

suddenly...

He lets out a TERRIFYING MECHANICAL SCREAM. As his body.

Jolts back. Legs, kicking. Arms, flailing. As his chest.

Begins opening up. Metal. Peeling back...

Spooner and Calvin watch in surprise as its interior UNFOLDS

like a PUZZLE BOX. A LABYRINTHINE area that is the SECOND

BATTERY. Suddenly fanning out to REVEAL...

A central brain made out of living tissue.

Spooner, stunned.   Calvin, rushing forward, excited...

As we MOVE IN.    Tracing the pathways of the synthetic brain.

As the metal casings. Begin returning to their original

places. Closing up. The CLICKING. Of all the pieces...

Sonny. Closed back up.     Shaking slightly from the

experience.

Spooner.   Walks into the center of the room.   Looking around.

AS WE PAN THE LAB. There's nothing there. Just a forest of

inanimate limbs. Nothing that could have fired that weapon.

Calvin sees nothing...and neither do we.

He crouches down low.

Calvin.   Even more confused.

He reaches out and unhooks a metal ARM.   Hanging from the

wall. Holds it up.

A CLOSE-UP of a ROBOTIC ARM.    Slowly CRAWLING across the lab

floor...

Calvin.   Taking the arm from Spooner.

A ROBOTIC TORSO hanging from the ceiling.     Reaches out an ARM

to grab another...

Locks eyes with Calvin...

Hogenmiller. In his lab. Suddenly turning to face

SOMETHING. Blood, draining from his face...

And then we see it:

A HUGE SELF-ASSEMBLED ROBOT. Towering over him. Multiple

arms, legs, heads. Writhing...as it grabs him. Holding him

in place...

...Forcing Hogenmiller's head to tilt back. Opening his

HAND. Inserting the gun. Hogenmiller's eyes. No longer

fearful. But sad as...

BANG!   He falls to the ground...

The assemblage of robot parts.    Stepping away from the body.

Taking itself apart...

Returning the lab.    To what it was before...

Calvin, spooked.   Glances around the lab.     Was that something

moving?

And with that.   He feels. That prickle at the back of his

neck. Calvin.    Looking past his shoulder.

Spooner swivels around to find...

VICTOR

Hovering behind him. Smiling broadly.   Upside down.   Spooner

straightens, reaching for his gun.

Turning himself, rightside up.

In the BACKGROUND. The SOUNDS. Of metallic GRINDING. GEARS

and JOINTS. CRUNCHING together. Sonny turns to look...takes

a step back...

Calvin, slowing.   Shocked...

CRACK! Something SLAPS into the glass wall. Right behind

her. Calvin. Jumps a mile. An NS-2, trying to break

through the glass...

Spooner.   Trains his gun on it when SUDDENLY...

The rest of the KILLER ROBOT appears.    The NS-2, just an

appendage...

All around them. SLAM! SLAM! SLAM! As SECURITY DOORS.

Begin CRASHING DOWN. Blocking off the exits...

Spooner, Calvin and Sonny, stumbling back. As the Killer

Robot HURLS itself against the GLASS...the thick GLASS...

spidering with a sickening CRACKLE...

Spooner.   Suddenly turning Sonny...

CRASH! The Killer Robot. Breaking through.      Its mechanical

TENDRILS. Reaching out. Sonny. Confused.

A SECURITY DOOR. Coming down. On a nearby exit.     Just

feet...from slamming shut...as...

The Killer Robot...leaps into the hallway...Sonny...

hesitates...looks over at Calvin...as the Killer Robot comes

HURTLING towards them...

The nearest EXIT...almost closed up...

They stop at a CONSOLE. BAM! The Killer Robot. Battering at

the door. Calvin. Tucks her hair behind her ears. Starts

punching keys on the console...

They look at each other. For a moment. Spooner, registering

that she's willing to destroy everything she's worked for...

BAM! The door. Puckering. With a sickening CRUNCH.

Calvin. Typing in. Emergency procedures...

VICTOR.   Popping up in front of her.

A final BAM! Then. The SOUND of metal. Skittering along a

bare floor. Calvin's hand, starts shaking. Spooner. Grabs

it. Squeezing.

He turns and starts heading back down...

THE PANELED CORRIDOR

Turning a corner to spy...

THE DOOR.   Mangled.   Hanging open.   But no.   Killer Robot.

He starts to turn around when...

CRACK! He's sent flying across the room. SMASHING into one

of the panels. The Killer Robot. Now re-configured. LOOMS

over him. Reaches out. Grabs him by the collar and...

FLINGS him across the room again. Spooner. CRASHING into

the wall like a rag doll. Slumps to the floor. Blood.

Pouring down his forehead. Seeing. The Killer Robot

lumbering towards him again. Raising a javelin-like arm...

AT THE CONSOLE

Calvin. Typing.     As fast as she can.   Doesn't know what's

going on...

A GRAPHIC spread out on the screen in front of her.

Illustrating the shut-down as a series of BRIGHT SQUARES

going dark...

THE KILLER ROBOT

Bearing down on Spooner. WHEN SPOONER. Suddenly rolls out

of the way. Reaching out for the hanging door and SMASHING

it into the Killer Robot.

The Killer Robot.   Momentarily stunned.   As Spooner.   Gets to

his feet...

WHEN SUDDENLY the Killer Robot. Splits in two again. One

half springing towards Spooner and wrapping a METALLIC HAND

around his throat...

Spooner stumbles back...GASPING for air...the ARM...

tightening its grip...Spooner's eyes...darting

around...looking for something...to help him...

Stumbling over...a fallen panel...his face...growing

redder...veins...popping up along his temples...

everything...growing BLURRY...

Victor's VOICE. Floating next to his head. Calm. Soothing.

His FACE. Suddenly appearing above Spooner. Its outlines.

Starting to FLICKER...

Spooner...trying to breathe...to stay conscious...

AT THE CONSOLE

Calvin. Continuing to type. A SHADOW.      Falling behind her --

the other half of the KILLER ROBOT...

SPOONER'S EYES

Beginning to flutter...

Spooner.     Losing it...

Spooner.     Trying to reach out to Victor...

WHEN SUDDENLY

Another HAND APPEARS. Grabbing the Killer Robot's ARM and

wrenching it off Spooner...

IT'S SONNY

He SMASHES the Half Killer Robot against the wall. Again and

again. Destroying it. Spooner. GASPING for breath. Can't

believe. Sonny came back...

Sonny. Holds out a hand.     To help Spooner up. Victor's

face. Starting to waver.     Starting to fade. Smiles.

Realisation. Spreading across Spooner's face. Looking

around for the other half of the Killer Robot -- CALVIN!

THE CONSOLE

CALVIN. Still typing. The last of the commands.     The KILLER

ROBOT. REARING UP BEHIND HER. WHEN...

SPOONER

Makes a DIVE for it. SHOOTING OUT HIS ROBOTIC ARM AND

BLOCKING THE KILLER ROBOT...

Victor's eyes.    Widening in surprise...

Spooner smiles.

Sonny, suddenly breaking into a smile, too.

Sonny, holds out his hand. Spooner. Looks at it. Then

takes it. CLOSE ON their two METAL HANDS. Locked in a

HANDSHAKE.

Sonny nods.   Looks out at the city scape.

Sonny looks at him. Grateful. Looks at Calvin. Then

hesitates. Turns. And hurries off across the Plaza.

Calvin and Spooner.   Watching them go.
