BLACK CLAD #2, keys in hand, flies across the counter,

carrying a large duffel bag... Heading to the vaults!

Black Clad #2 arrives, drops his bag, unzipping...

Lorenz gets the message, finds THE BANK MANAGER cowering

behind his desk.

The Bank Manager nods nervously.

BLACK CLAD #4 holds open his bag. He strides by the

CUSTOMERS who deposit CELLPHONES, PAGERS, inside.

The Bank Manager taps on his computer keyboard.

Lorenz nods.

BLACK CLAD #1 flips the "BANK CLOSED" sign around.

Jenkins fastens his cufflinks.   In the bed behind him...

HEATHER "TEDDY" GALLOWAY, 30's, normally a force to reckon

with, appears vulnerable with only a sheet wrapped around

her.

Teddy gestures to the night stand. Jenkins retrieves the

watch. He also slides his WEDDING RING back on. This ain't

love, this is a relationship of convenience.

Jenkins slips on his jacket, secures his tie and, after one

last check in the mirror...

And with that, Jenkins exits. Teddy waits for the door to

close, then collapses back onto the bed.

PLASTIC EXPLOSIVES line the walls, connect all the safety

deposit boxes together! BLACK CLAD #2, takes cover, readies

the detonation device and...

He FLIPS A SWITCH and... KA-BOOM!    AN EXPLOSION RIPS THROUGH

THE VAULT!

A PILLOW OF SMOKE BLOWS into the lobby! Lorenz stands

UNFLINCHING. The explosion was expected.

BEHIND THE CUSTOMER SERVICE WINDOWS--

An EAGER TELLER, 30's, seizes the moment.    He reaches up and

PRESSES THE SILENT ALARM BUTTON!

BLACK CLAD #4 turns just in time to see it, quickly FIRES his

weapon! The Eager Teller slumps against the wall, BLEEDS

profusely from his neck, not dead yet.

Lorenz hustles over to Black Clad #4.

Lorenz GLARES DISGUSTEDLY at his accomplice.

Lorenz levels, very calmly, his weapon at the Eager Teller's

head and...

The Eager's Teller's body keels over, dead.    Lorenz checks

his watch... 9:26 a.m.

The Four Seasons it ain't.

There's not enough soap on the planet for Teddy to feel

clean. Doubt and fear present on her face. She turns off

the water, and steps out... when she does HER PAGER, off

screen, chimes!

Teddy, a towel wrapped around her, picks up the pager.   The

number: 911. She picks up the TELEPHONE, dials.

SIRENS BLARE... POLICE CARS brake hard, blocking traffic.

OFFICERS fly out, shotguns out!

HELICOPTERS circle. NEWS VANS speed onto the scene as the

CROWDS builds. Standing in the center of things...

DETECTIVE BERNIE CALLO, 40's, a stern, by-the-book cop. Not

a popular member of the force. TWO OFFICERS, 30's, follow

him.

A phone cord is YANKED from the wall!

Black Clad #1 and #4 push Customers and Employees inside!

They door SLAMS SHUT.

POV OF LORENZ - Callo approaches the Tech Van.

Lorenz peeks through the curtains.       A phone pressed between

his shoulder and ear.

He places a VOICE MODULATOR over the phone's mouthpiece (this

will leave his voice sounding LIFELESS and DISTORTED to those

on the receiving end).

Black Clad #1 and #4 remove from their bag - ropes, pulleys,

an iron spike and hammer. #1 also removes... a spear-gun.

#1 connects the rope to a spear. FIRES the spear into the

wall above the bank's front windows! He snags a 2nd spear,

repeats.

The Detectives huddle.   Impatience level high.

Dax, humbled, does as ordered.

Conners fumbles with the wrapper, but eventually sticks

another piece of gum in his mouth. Teddy notices.

SHOOTING SCRIPT                  MARCH 15, 2004          23.

Each Team makes their move, when...

Black Clad #1 PULLS A CORD, instantly...     ALL THE CURTAINS

DROP!

Conners freezes...

Black Clad #3 FLIPS A SWITCH. Suddenly, a canister attached

to the pulleys race up the ropes! The HOSTAGES have their

feet yanked out from under them, then shoot INTO THE AIR!

They SMASH THROUGH A GLASS HANDRAIL ON THE SECOND FLOOR,

then...

SHOOT to the TOP OF THE WALL-LENGTH WINDOWS! They hang,

dangle helplessly! On FULL DISPLAY for the outside to see!

DEKKER. CONNERS. SWAT. ONLOOKERS.       Everyone in the

vicinity react in HORROR!

THE NEWS CREWS, led by Karen Cross, race to grab the story.

The SWAT Commander:

Officers try to control the situation, but can't.

Pedestrians racing around. Conners, in the middle of the

anarchy...

The SWAT Commander makes his own call...

The SWAT TEAM bum rushes the bank, just as...

KABOOM!   A FIREBALL BLASTS through the door, BLOWS off its

hinges!   The SWAT guys are blown off their feet! Then...

THE FRONT WINDOWS BLOW OUT! AN EXPLOSION! FIRE SHOOTS IN

ALL DIRECTIONS! A POLICE BARRICADE BLOWS OVER!

Everyone outside is BLOWN OFF THEIR FEET! Conners, Dekker

HIT THE DECK! SHARDS OF GLASS FLY! SMOKE FLOODS INTO THE

STREETS!

Simultaneously, An EXPLOSIONS BLASTS OUT THE WEST SIDE DOORS!

THE DETECTIVES AND SWAT TEAM DUCK FROM THE BLAST!

THE BLACK CLAD'S TRUCK EXPLODES, FLIPS IN THE AIR!

It's a genuine WAR ZONE!    SMOKE, FIRE AND DEBRIS LITTER THE

AREA AROUND THE BANK!

Conners peers up as...    The HOSTAGES RUN OUT, SCREAM IN

TERROR!

SHOOTING SCRIPT                 MARCH 15, 2004              26.

ALL THE LIGHTS COME UP, as...   Conners KICKS IN THE DOOR,

but... It's empty.

Dekker leads his group. His heart POUNDING THROUGH HIS

CHEST. His Gun up and ready. Suddenly...

A NOISE up ahead... He bares down, takes a DEEP BREATH,

carefully proceeds until... Teddy and Vincent emerge. Teddy

EXHALES, lowers her weapon. So does Dekker.

Conners strides out from behind the counters...

The SWAT COMMANDER approaches holding a couple of the BLACK

MASKS, some BLACK BODY ARMOR.

Conners takes one of the masks in his hands.

Dekker, Teddy, the SWAT Commander, Officers, Vincent and the

SWAT Team stand in the middle of the lobby, STUNNED.

Conners, his anger SIMMERS TO A BOIL, until finally...

An OFFICER unfurls a FRESH ROLL of "POLICE: CAUTION" TAPE

around the scene. Still mayhem, but gradually coming under

control.

Police interview HOSTAGES, so do REPORTERS. PARAMEDICS

administer oxygen. Two CORONERS load the EAGER TELLER's body

into their truck.

Jenkins ignores Teddy.

Jenkins exits.

Conners approaches...

A grade "B" rating, tops.   CUSTOMERS dine, choke down coffee.

AT A BOOTH--

Empty plates and crumpled napkins litter the table. Conners

finishes a cup of coffee, enjoys a slice of pie. Dekker, all

about work, goes over his notes.

Conners, Dekker and Teddy approach a NEWS TRUCK. Vincent

stands with Karen Cross and her CAMERAMAN who sports TWO

BLACK EYES AND A BLOODY NOSE.

Conners ignores her, but Dekker doesn't.   He gives her the

ONCE OVER. She notices, smiles.

He points to a monitor in the van, presses PLAY.

HANDHELD IMAGES of the POST BANK MELEE. HOSTAGES scatter in

all directions. COPS race into the bank.

A SHAGGY BROWN HAIRED MAN, 40's, with a MOUSTACHE and an

ANGRY EXPRESSION, CHARGES TOWARDS THE CAMERA and BARRELS OVER

IT! KNOCKS the Camera and the Cameraman DOWN!

ON SCREEN...   the IMAGE FREEZES on the SHAGGY MAN'S FACE.

SHOOTING SCRIPT                   MARCH 15, 2004            37.

Conners reloads.     Everything's quiet.   Conners looks...

A THIN LAYER OF SMOKE hovers.     But that's all.    Nobody in

sight.

Conners steps inside, just as he reaches the living room...

BAM!   ANOTHER BLAST!    This one FROM THE BEDROOM!

Conners DROPS TO THE FLOOR, falls back into the kitchen!

Dekker enters the apartment.

Dekker passes the kitchen door, looks in on Conners.

OFF SCREEN: A Window BREAKS...      from the bedroom.   Dekker

heads that way.

DAMON RICHARDS crawls onto the FIRE ESCAPE!

But Richards doesn't.     He FIRES another shotgun BLAST!

Dekker DUCKS BACK into the living room. He aims his gun into

the bedroom without looking... RAPID FIRES!

A bullet HITS Richards IN THE SHOULDER!     HE YELPS IN PAIN,

but manages to...

Richards scrambles out.

Dekker looks inside the bedroom, doesn't see Richards.     He

takes one step inside when...

GINA, 20's, Latino, wearing only a pair of red panties with

NO BRA, runs up behind Dekker and JUMPS ON HIS BACK, FISTS

FLYING!

Dekker pushes her down, aims his gun at her.

Vincent enters, grabs Gina.

He does.    Dekker runs to the bedroom window, peeks out

over...

Richards... floors below. Clutches his shoulder in pain, yet

fearlessly charges downward.

But he's already gone.

DEKKER hops onto the fire escape, hoofs down the iron stairs.

Richards... drops to the pavement.      Heads for the street.

DEKKER, a flight from the bottom, realizes his disadvantage

and HURLS himself over the rail! Hits the ground HARD,

WIPES OUT!

Jumps up, shaking it off.    STAYS IN PURSUIT!

Dekker races around the corner...    A FORD F-350 SPINS the

corner. Targeting DEKKER!

Dekker jerks out his Glock.    FIRES!

BULLETS RICOCHET OFF THE GRILL, SPARKS FLY! Windshield

spiderwebs. But this train ain't slowing down.

The F-350 swerves, clips a Harley.

Dekker JUMPS before impact, bounces off the hood and rolls

away.

The truck hits the street, speeds away.

Dekker, grimacing through the pain, scrapes himself off the

pavement. Dekker's eyes dance... spot THE HARLEYS.

Dekker picks up the bike, hops on.      Fires up the engine.

Richards' Truck speeds around a SLOW MOVING VEHICLE and whips

into an alley.

The Slow Vehicle skids to a stop! Dekker's hog, cuts inside,

between the vehicle and the sidewalk, rips into the alley.

Richards fishtails down the alley. Barely maintaining

control. GARBAGE DUMPSTERS are littered about creating an

obstacle course. Dekker pursues.

Richards barrels out of the alley, through the intersection

and into another alley. Opposing traffic skids out. ANGRY

DRIVERS let him have it.

Dekker skids sideways, steers around the blockage.     Catches

sight of...

DOWN THE BLOCK...   A PATROL CAR speeds down Hastings Street.

Dekker revs the engine, maneuvers around the ANGRY DRIVERS

and follows Richards into the SECOND ALLEY!

Conners, behind the wheel, speeds towards the scene.

Richards races, checks the rearview mirror...      Dekker's Hog

closing in.

UP AHEAD...   The alley exits onto RICHARDS STREET.

Richards approaches the mouth of the alley, just as A STREET

CLEANER appears, starts to block the exit.

Richards STAMPS ON THE ACCELERATOR, speeds through the small

opening, just past the Street Cleaner!

Dekker's not so lucky. Sees the Street Cleaner too late...

Lays out the hog and rolls just as... The Hog slides into

the Street Cleaner!

Dekker gets up, looks down the street, SEES...

Richards getting away, speeds down the street, through

another intersection, when...

CRASH! Conners, in a patrol car, plows into the rear of the

truck, spinning it around.

Dekker races towards the crash site.

Conners climbs out of the car.

Richards shakes his head, clearing it. Blood squirts from

his mouth. He sees, through the windshield, Conners coming

for him. He scrambles for his handgun, looks up to see

Conners, but he's not there. Richards turns as...

Conners appears in the Driver's side window, grabs the back

of Richards' head and SLAMS it into the steering wheel!

Again!

Conners reaches inside, grabs the handgun.   As Dekker

arrives...

His last words before PASSING OUT.

A HALF A DOZEN CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATORS go through the

place.

Gina, a cop's jacket around her, is led away in handcuffs.

Dekker smirks.

A PARAMEDIC, 30's, checks Conners out.    Teddy concludes her

cellphone conversation.

The Paramedic gives up, exits.   Teddy leans down beside

Conners.

Finally, finding the right row, they turn in.

AN EMPTY SPACE, marked in tape, "ITEM #4958378."

Dekker and Conners surround Harry as he digs through his file

box. After a few moments, grabs a clipboard.

Off the main road, sits a DARK, TWO-STORY HOME on a HILLSIDE.

The design is MODERN, FLAWLESS and COLD. Every room is

equipped with VIDEO CAMERAS and MONITORS.

ON THE MONITOR... The screen is divided into 16 small boxes

showing the actions simultaneously throughout the house. Our

concentration settles on BOX #7...

CHRIS LEI, live and in the flesh, quickly stuffs belongings

into a suitcase. He's nervous, tense. From the top drawer

of his dresser, he grabs an armful of underwear, socks, dumps

them into the suitcase.

What Chris doesn't see...

IN THE REFLECTION OF THE MIRROR ON THE DRESSER...   LORENZ!

Conners pulls the car to the curb.    He and Dekker hop out.

From his second floor window, Chris sees Conners and Dekker.

Chris turns, FINDS HIMSELF STARING DOWN A BARREL!

Chris swallows, Lorenz pulls the trigger and...

BAM! THE GUNSHOT ECHOES OUTSIDE. Conners and Dekker draw

their weapons, quickly descend on the house!

THE FRONT DOOR KICKS IN! Dekker and Conners cautiously

enter. They move the way veteran partners would. No

indications that these two just met today.

The House is almost PITCH BLACK.

Conners motions that he's going up, signals for Dekker to

take the back of the house.

Dekker proceeds inside.   After a scan, the kitchen's clean.

Conners emerges from the stairway.

Dekker steps from the back hallway into the DARKENED living

room. Eyes straight ahead and sharp. What he doesn't see...

LORENZ STEPS FROM THE DARKNESS.

Conners moves from the hall, into the bedroom where he

finds... Chris's dead Body. He checks for a pulse when he

notices...

ON THE MONITOR... Conners sees A SHADOWY FIGURE BEHIND

Dekker!

Dekker, oblivious to Lorenz's presence, continues on.    Heads

for the front hallway.

Lorenz raises his gun, narrows his sites on Dekker.

Simultaneously... CONNERS DIVES, TACKLES DEKKER BEHIND the

living room wall -- LORENZ OPENS FIRE, UNLOADS A FULL CLIP!

A BULLET GRAZES DEKKER'S SHOULDER!    THE REST LITTER THE

WALLS, BLOW APART A MIRROR!

Conners and Dekker, behind the wall, regroup. Conners

RETALIATES. FIRES FOUR ROUNDS AT LORENZ, but...

An EMERGENCY MEDICAL TECHNICIAN, 30's, attends to Dekker's

injured shoulder. Dekker grimaces from the pain. Conners

approaches...

To establish.

HANDCUFFS lock Richards to his bed. Richards is hooked up to

an IV and a tube's up his nose. A HEART RATE MONITOR chimes

rhythmically.

Two UNIFORMED OFFICERS look on as Conners and Dekker enter.

The officers exit. Conners LOCKS the door, walks to the bed,

leans over Richards.

Conners concedes the floor.     Dekker addresses Richards.

Dekker turns his attention to Richards' IV, the tubes which

carry medication into his body.

Conners drives, Dekker shotgun.      Conners more intense than

normal.

Conners, RAIN POUNDING DOWN, aims his gun, MOUTHS THE

WORDS...

JOHN CURTIS, the kidnapper on the bridge, aims his gun,

FIRES!

CONNERS FIRES!    BAM!

His bullets keep Vincent and Teddy pinned down.

Knight hurries out of the car...

HARRINGTON sees this, FIRES!

The bullet STRIKES KNIGHT IN THE NECK!

GALT FIRES!

Simultaneously...    BRANCH FIRES!    HARRINGTON FIRES!

THE BULLET RIPS INTO HARRINGTON'S ARM! He's hit, but not

down. He and Galt duck back inside the house!

Branch takes a bullet in the leg.      He goes down.

Conners, Dekker, Vincent, Teddy converge on the house.

They all rush inside...

Conners and Dekker make their way up the stairs...

Teddy and Vincent head down the hall...

Conners and Dekker move carefully. Conners points for Dekker

to go in the other direction. Dekker obeys, slides down the

other side of the hall.

Teddy's on her toes.   She smells something, but keeps moving.

Teddy's EYES fall to...

ON THE FLOOR... next to the base of the door is a FUSE.         It

runs from the wall into the vent.

She follows it into THE KITCHEN.

Vincent and Dekker get up.        Dekker looks upstairs...

Conners and Galt struggle. Conners PUNCHES Galt, sends him

back! He then SLAMS Galt against the wall, Galt KNEES

Conners in the gut.

Galt goes for the gun, Conners KICKS out his legs from

underneath him! But before Conners can get the upper hand,

Galt fights back! The two continue...

The fuse comes out of the vent... IT'S LIT!       THE OVEN...

HEAR the gas emission...

Teddy rushes from the house...

The spark.    The Gas.    The EXPLOSION!

THE BLAST BLOWS DEKKER AND VINCENT THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR AND

OUT OF THE HOUSE!

Lorenz AKA SCOTT CURTIS watches through a pair of binoculars.

No emotion evident.

FIRE TRUCKS, POLICE CARS and EMERGENCY VEHICLES surround the

house. The LIGHTS FLASH AN EERIE RED across the scene.

FIREMEN try to extinguish the flames.

Several NEWS TRUCKS have arrived, always after the story.

A CORONER, 40's, zips shut a body bag. Inside the BADLY

BURNT BODY of Detective Conners. The BADGE ON HIS BELT still

visible. They load him into the truck.

TEDDY, her face drained of life, stares at the truck. A

Fireman walks behind them, back towards the fire truck.

JENKINS huddles with a group of Detectives.

Teddy and Dekker overhear this.

Teddy really wants to explode, but doesn't. She walks away.

Jenkins digests what she said, then his eyes find Dekker...

KAREN CROSS finds Teddy, has her Cameraman FOCUS in on her.

Teddy looks STRAIGHT INTO THE CAMERA, but can't say a thing.

That's when DEKKER grabs the camera, PUSHES it out of her

face.

Karen and her Cameraman leave Teddy and Dekker alone.

Quiet, mostly dark.     A few fluorescent lights and a desk

lamp...

Dekker sits at Conners' desk. A somber moment, reflecting on

the man, his career. He shuts off the lamp, heads for the

door.

Dekker turns to find...       Dax, cradling a 3,000 PAGE DOCUMENT.

Dekker shuffles to his car, his cellphone rings.

Answering...

Lorenz hangs up. Dekker surprisingly calm, hangs up the

phone, heads back inside the station.

Dekker at his desk, piles through mounds of paperwork.   Not

sure what to look for, he goes through everything.

His notes from the bank. The file on Galt, Harrington, Chris

Lei. He even digs through Conners and finally... Callo's

file.

Jenkins heads for the exit.

Jenkins exits.

Dekker falls back into his chair. Then... discovers...

Callo's file... The Property Room Sign-Out Sheet. The

signatures.

Harry Hume, the evidence room cop, out of uniform, walks

inside, sits across from... Dekker, already here, with two

DIFFERENT FILES available to him.

Images FLASH before our eyes...

The RAIN POURS DOWN!   An SUV CRASHES into a STALLED-OUT

VEHICLE.

JOHN CURTIS (THE KIDNAPPER) crawls out of the SUV! He sees

cop's lights approaching. He drags LISA REANN (THE VICTIM)

out of the truck. A BRIGHT LIGHT (from a helicopter) strikes

John in the eyes!

LIGHTS!   EVERYWHERE BRIGHT!   It's all very BLINDING!

COPS block both sides of the bridge!   TV REPORTERS AT EITHER

END OF THE BRIDGE!

John holds the gun up to Lisa's head as... OVER JOHN'S

SHOULDER... CONNERS APPROACHES, GUN DRAWN!

Lisa struggles, tears streaming down her face.

A FLASH OF LIGHT ENVELOPS CONNERS!

CLOSE ON... A GUN FIRES!

John DROPS lifeless to the pavement.

Harry pounds the table...

Harry goes silent.   Realizes he just let the cat out of the

bag.

IN REVERSE MOTION - JOHN CURTIS GETS UP... THE BULLET RE-

ENTERS CONNERS'S GUN... LISA REANN SCREAMS!

REVEAL THE ENTIRE SCENE: LORENZ/ CURTIS STANDS NEXT TO

CONNERS ON THE BRIDGE HOLDING A GUN.

LORENZ/CURTIS IS YORK!

NOW RESUME ACTION... Conners and York aim their guns at...

John holds Lisa tight.

John PUSHES the barrel of the gun TIGHTER into Lisa's temple.

York narrows his aim on John Curtis.

SIMULTANEOUSLY... YORK FIRES just as Lisa STRUGGLES, MOVES!

The Bullet intended for John Curtis, HITS Lisa, kills her

instantly.

Lisa's body crumples to the ground.

Conners and York look on in horror, knowing York's bullet

felled an innocent.

John turns to fire on the detectives...      Conners fires -

KILLS John Curtis!

John's body hits pavement.      RAIN POURS DOWN!

Dekker puts it together...

Dax and Teddy are speechless.

Dax and Dekker gather at Dax's desk.      Dax is on the phone.

A BEAUTIFUL, BRIGHT FULL MOON hangs in the dark sky. Dozens

of COMMERCIAL LINERS, CARGO SHIPS and SEAPLANES line the

piers.

Open twenty-four hours a day, 365 days a year. A handful of

cars occupy the spaces out front. Including the MERCEDES.

A scattering of PATRONS, some at the counter, some in booths.

A PRETTY WAITRESS, 20's, rings up a bill.

YORK AKA LORENZ/CURTIS hands the Cashier a twenty.

A BUS BOY, 19, carries some garbage out the back.

York heads for the exits, opens the door and... STEPS

OUTSIDE!

York hoofs two steps outside when...

A BRIGHT SPOTLIGHT STRIKES YORK'S FACE!   He shields his

eyes...

BEHIND THE LIGHTS... Dekker and Teddy aim their pistols.

York RAISES HIS HANDS HIGH, takes a small step backwards.

York takes another tiny back-step.

York bends down to ONE KNEE, DRAWS A 9 MM... FIRES!

DEKKER AND TEDDY DUCK FOR COVER!

YORK RUSHES BACK INTO THE RESTAURANT!

DEKKER AND TEDDY RETURN FIRE!

THE GLASS WINDOW DOORS EXPLODE!

CUSTOMERS SCREAM AS...

Dekker enters, surveys the restaurant.

A LOUD BANGING FROM THE KITCHEN!

Dekker approaches the kitchen door, pushes it open and...

BAM!   BAM!    BAM!   BULLETS RIP APART THE KITCHEN DOOR!

Dekker spins out of the way. As gunfire stops, Dekker KICKS

through the door! Leans in gun first...

In the center of the room... York neck-holds the Pretty

Waitress, gun to her head.

Dekker moves in...

Dekker looks her in the eyes, then darts away.

Dekker exits the back.     Finds the Pretty Waitress.    Shook up.

York sprints across the street.        Dekker follows.

HUNDREDS OF GIANT STEEL CARGO CONTAINERS litter the yard...

makes the place look and feel like a GIANT MAZE.

York disappears into the steel maze.

Dekker enters, slows to a walk. Carefully proceeds forward.

Gun drawn. Second guessing each turn.

Dekker rounds a corner...

At the far end of the container, York FIRES!

Dekker ducks back.

York takes a look out, doesn't see Dekker.

Dekker peers around the corner... York's gone.

Dekker speed-walks, continuing the search.

Dekker stops, eyes a full 360. The containers all look

alike. Dekker wonders if he's just going around in circles.

Until...

BAM! BAM! BAM! BULLETS RICOCHET ALL AROUND DEKKER!         He

dive-rolls for cover as...

ON TOP OF A CONTAINER... York UNLEASHES, until... CLICK!        Out

of ammo.

Dekker, hearing this, pops up, RETURNS FIRE!

York leaps off the backside of the container!

Dekker gives chase. As he circles the container... no York.

Instead, he finds a DOCK.

A narrow wooden dock. There's a few small boats, A TUG BOAT

and at the end... A SEAPLANE.

Dekker approaches the tug. Each step slow and deliberate.

EYES TRANSFIXED on the seaplane.

As he nears the Seaplane... A SHADOW RISES from BEHIND HIM.

From on top of the TUG BOAT!

Dekker turns just as...

York throws a fishing net on top of Dekker.    As Dekker

struggles in the net, HIS GUN DISCHARGES!

York with a PIKE POLE in hand, leaps down, CLUBBING Dekker

over the head with the weapon. Dekker goes down!

Dekker's gun SLIDES off the dock, into the water.

York charges Dekker with the PIKE POLE, ready to stab,

when...

At the last second... DEKKER ROLLS AWAY! THE PIKE POLE

BREAKS A WOODEN PLANK TO PIECES, sticks into the ground

beneath the water.

Dekker, still tangled in the net, KICKS OUT York's legs.        He

falls to the planks.

York quickly rebounds. He POUNCES on Dekker, from behind he

wraps his arm around Dekker's throat, CHOKING HIM.

Dekker struggles to breathe.    York SQUEEZES harder.

Dekker fights, arms flailing. He REACHES blindly behind

York, grabs a hold of the PIKE POLE. The pole SNAPS in two!

Dekker wildly SWINGS at York who dodges easily.

York SLAMS Dekker into the side of the TUG.       Still choking.

Dekker, on his last gasp, PUSHES OFF THE TUG!

York stumbles backwards, GETS HIS FOOT CAUGHT IN THE HOLE!

He twists, spinning around, falling down onto...

... THE REMAINING PIKE SPEAR!    The Pike punches through his

chest... POPS out his back!

York, blood and life escaping him, his eyes find Dekker.

Then go dead.

Dekker steps close.   Holds a cold, remorseless stare at

York's body.

Lights Flash from the AMBULANCES AND POLICE CARS. A

HELICOPTER HOVERS overhead. Karen Cross interviews Jenkins.

Teddy, arm in sling, and Dekker sip on some already cold

coffee.

Marnie explains to Dekker and Conners...

Off of Conners' LOOK.

Dekker realizes it's the same smell, but how did this ten get

in his wallet?

Conners and Dekker get to know one another...      The Waitress

lays down the check.

Conners drops a TEN DOLLAR BILL on the table.

Dekker SCOOPS UP Conners's TEN, PUTS IT IN HIS WALLET and

drops a twenty down on the table.

Dekker, a million thoughts spiral at once, runs from the

diner!

Teddy exits the ladies room, but Dekker is gone.

Dekker again scans the line -- he's not there.         He scans all

the faces AGAIN, but still nothing.

Dekker SPOTS A MAN ON A CELLPHONE, he runs up to him, SPINS

HIM AROUND, BUT... It's not Conners.

Conners on his phone, with attached Voice Modulater.

Dekker at his car... On the phone, listens.       But on this

ends it sounds like...

SHOOTING SCRIPT                   MARCH 15, 2004           100.

Conners PUSHES DEKKER OUT OF THE WAY, just in the nick of

time!

DEKKER TUMBLES DOWN THE STAIRS!      Vincent breaks his fall.

Conners FIRES TOWARDS THE DOOR!      After...

Conners takes out a small remote detonator.     Pushes the FIRST

BUTTON!

A VENT...   A FLASH GOES BY!

SHOOTING SCRIPT                    MARCH 15, 2004            101.

ON THE FLOOR... next to the base of the door is a FUSE. It

runs from the wall into the vent. Teddy follows it into THE

KITCHEN.

The fuse comes out of the vent... IT'S LIT! THE OVEN...

HEAR the gas emission... The spark. The Gas.

THE FIRST EXPLOSION!

Conners leans over Galt, a giant GASH across his head, feels

for a pulse. He's dead. Conners looks into the hallway,

SEES THE FIRE!

Conners gets up, and reaches INTO THE BATHTUB, drags out... a

CORPSE, HOOKS HIS BADGE ONTO THE CORPSE'S BELT and lays him

on the floor.

Conners QUICKLY opens a LAUNDRY SHOOT, SHIMMIES INSIDE AND

SLIDES DOWN...

Conners lands safely on a mattress he left on the floor.

Once settled, he pushes the SECOND BUTTON ON THE DETONATOR

and...

KA-BOOM!   A SECOND EXPLOSION!     THE ENTIRE HOUSE BLOWS!

Conners opens a trunk, inside is a FIREMAN'S RAIN COAT,

HELMET AND VISOR!

In the aftermath of the fire...      SEVERAL FIREMAN, POLICE,

REPORTERS, etc. are on scene.

SHOOTING SCRIPT                 MARCH 15, 2004              102.

Dekker and Teddy don't see... A FIREMAN PASSES BEHIND THEM,

turns his head slightly, REVEAL THROUGH THE VISOR IT'S

CONNERS!

Dekker continues his search for Conners all to no avail. He

TURNS HIS BACK, just as... A MAN WALKS RIGHT PAST DEKKER

CARRYING A CELLPHONE!

SHOOTING SCRIPT                  MARCH 15, 2004           104.

As Dekker continues his search, his cellphone CUTS OFF!

Dekker doesn't notice... THE MAN walks past security and out

of the Western Airlines terminal.

CONNERS walks through the small area, proceeds out to...

Conners walks down the aisle, finds his seat.

She hands him a glass of champagne.

The private plane TAKES OFF!
