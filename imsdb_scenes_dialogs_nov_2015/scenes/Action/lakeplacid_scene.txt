OVER BLACK we HEAR the distant but near melodic CRY of a LOON.

SLOWLY FADE IN TO:

EXT. BLACK LAKE - NIGHT

The loon continues its hypnotic call, as the steamy mist lifts

off the dark water, which doesn't even ripple.  The loon

continues her nocturnal cry, as we savor the beauty of the lake,

the elegance of the bird, and the haunting echo of her lonely

call... until suddenly the bird is crisply pulled under,

silenced forever.  A lone feather surfaces and floats as:

Credits roll over the black lake to Richie Havens singing "I CAN

SEE CLEARLY NOW." Then--

OVER BLACK

As we FADE IN a face COMES INTO FOCUS from underwater.  It is

the face of WALT LAWSON (Maine Fish And Game) looking down from

a boat.

EXT. LAKE - DAY

Next to him is SHERIFF HANK KEOUGH, paunch, disposition of an

untipped waiter.

Keough holds a stare.  Walt drops overboard.  Keough pulls a

Twinkie from his pocket.  Begins to unwrap.

EXT. NEW YORK - MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY

INT. MUSEUM - DAY

FIND  KELLY SCOTT, pretty, thirty, as KEVIN CAMPBELL, forties,

approaches.

She beams affection, he exudes a little discomfort.

INT. KEVIN'S OFFICE - DAY

They enter ON THE CUT, he closes the door.

Reading his look, she suddenly smells it.  Her face drops.

She's a little crushed.

A beat.

And she rushes out of the room.  OFF Kevin, we:

EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY

Walt dives down, visibility is lousy. Whether it's algae or

dense vegetation, the water is extremely murky.

EXT. LAKE - CONTINUOUS

Keough unwraps the second Twinkie.

EXT. UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS

Walt continues to swim.

HIS P.O.V.

Not much to look at.  Then suddenly... no, just a snapping

turtle swimming away.  Walt descends a little deeper.  He loves

it beneath the water, there's a tranquility he can find nowhere

else.  Next best thing to meditation.  Suddenly, he stops

kicking.

HIS EYES FOCUS

A black water snake, it must be almost three feet in length.

RESUME

Walt flippers himself closer, wants a closer look.  The snake

seems unimpressed.  Then suddenly, the snake lunges at him,

misses.  Shit.  Walt's look says "what the fuck?"  A beat.  Then

the snake swims off.  Walt relaxes.  A beat.  But then... he

looks around, uneasy.  He gets this feeling he's not alone down

there.  Looks about, nothing but murky water.  But he's not

alone, we can feel he's not alone.

He looks left, right... then... four snakes, swimming, hovering,

looking back at him.  What's with these snakes?  Walt decides

he'll go back to the boat.  Then... BOOM.  Something hits him...

and it's no snake.

EXT. BOAT - CONTINUOUS

Keough.  Oblivious.  Waiting.  Suddenly-- Walt comes thrusting

up with a scream!

And Walt is promptly yanked back under.

Upon which Walt surfaces.  He swims frantically for a beat

before he's suddenly yanked under again.  Then he surfaces,

thrashing as Keough speeds over with the boat.  He takes hold of

him and pulls him on board.  Actually... what's left of him.

There's nothing below the waist.  Walt is just a bleeding torso,

though still conscious.

ANGLE WALT'S REMAINING HAND

clenching around Keough's arm.

ANGLE WALT'S FACE

He knows he's done.  OFF Keough's continued horror, we:

BLACK AND WHITE

A DINOSAUR (T-Rex) is angry and out for blood.

REVEAL

INT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY

We're watching an old classic creature feature.  FIND Kelly

alone, slowly eating popcorn, rapt, tense... watching the movie.

As the suspense builds, her hand freezes halfway between the

popcorn bag and her mouth.

ANGLE THE SCREEN

The monster pursues its human victim.

ANGLE KELLY

fear on her face.

ANGLE THE SCREEN

The monster makes its final surge, capturing its prey.

ANGLE KELLY

as she screams with fear and delight.  Her scream is only

partially muted by the shrieks of the other moviegoers.

After a beat, she calms, daring to eat popcorn again.  Wearing

gullibility, vulnerability all over her face.  Then from behind

a hand appears, taps her shoulder, causing her to let loose with

the most blood-curdling scream of all.

All the moviegoers turn to SEE... as will WE:

MYRA OKUBO

Thirties, standing mortified; the woman who tapped her shoulder.

EXT. NEW YORK CITY - DAY

Kelly and Okubo emerge from the movie theater.

Kelly freezes.  Stares at her.  Then:

A beat.

And Kelly peels off to go on her way.  Bumps into a Pedestrian.

She then gives him an angry shove, under--

And off she goes.  The Pedestrian and Okubo exchange a look.

EXT. LAKE - DAY

Coroner's ambulance.  Walt's covered body is being loaded, as

JACK WELLS, Fish and Game, thirty, emerges from his truck.  He

approaches the body.  Lifts up the sheet.  Stares a beat in

disbelief.  Turns to Keough.

OFF Keough, we:

INT. MUSEUM - DAY

Kelly's in her office, working at her desk.  Kevin enters.

Now she looks up.

Kelly stares back.  The nickle drops.

EXT. MAINE SKIES - DAY

A sea helicopter is sailing up against the blue sky, nothing but

Evergreens and lakes below.

INT. HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS

Kelly with the Pilot.  She looks a little white.

INT. JACKSON HOSPITAL - DAY

Kelly is walking with Keough toward the morgue.

CLOSE ON THE TOOTH

Reveal--

INT. MORGUE - DAY

The Medical Examiner, STEVEN DANIELS, is there with Keough and

kelly.  Walt's torso is covered.  Kelly is examining the tooth.

And Daniels is about to pull the sheet back--

She takes a breath.

And Daniels peels back the sheet.  Kelly strains to disguise her

extreme horror.  Finally--

OFF this, we:

EXT. INDIGO MAINE - DAY

It's a small, almost tiny town; general store, post office, fire

station.  Kelly and Keough are in front of the general store

loading supplies into a van, across the street in front of the

Sheriff's Department.

That strikes a nerve.

He stares back.  Then picks up a huge cannon-like gun.  As he

loads it--

A beat.

Suddenly, like a shot, Kelly's arm jerks up as she jet sprays a

white fog from a can of Yard Guard.  Keough holds a look at her.

Upon which a sport utility vehicle pulls up, it's marked "Maine

Fish And Game".  Jack Wells emerges, Kelly's eyes scan him like

radar.

Kelly shoots Keough a look.  Then:

Jack holds a look, decides to let that pass.

Jack holds another look.

Keough also lets that pass.

As they start out, Kelly grabs Jack by the arm.

As JANINE POST, sixteen, flirtatious little vixen, steps up.

And Janine goes into the store.  The men just watch her go.

Sixteen going on twenty, nubile.  Kelly just looks at the men,

gaping at the girl.

EXT. LAKE - DAY

Keough, Jack, and Kelly are in a boat motoring towards a

farmhouse.  No other houses in sight.

INT. FARM HOUSE - DAY

Jack, Kelly and Keough are questioning DELORES BICKERMAN, mid-

sixties, eccentric if not slightly daffy.  She's brought out

refreshments.

Off Bickerman's silence--

Keough clenches his eyes shut.  The old woman's a loon.

Jack, Keough, and Kelly just stare back at this crazy woman.

Off their looks--

EXT. LAKE - DAY

Keough and Kelly are in the boat slowly traveling along the

thickly wooded shoreline.

Jack smiles, gets her sarcasm.

Keough's attention has been otherwise arrested.  He sees

something in the water.

He leans over to grab something floating in the water.  Looks

like a branch.  He lifts it up, revealing it to be an antler.

Connected to the severed head of a moose.  Keough, seeing it as

he lifts it, screams, throwing it.

It hits Kelly and she screams, a blood-curdling scream, as the

HEAD hits the floor of the boat with a HEAVY THUD.  Kelly rears

back, still screaming, and belts Keough in the shoulder.

She belts him again.

ANGLE THE HEAD

RESUME

A beat.  This head looks ripped off the body.

EXT. BEACHSIDE CAMPSITE - AN HOUR LATER

A small tent camp is being set up.  People unpacking.  Two

Deputies, BURKE and STEPHENS, present.  Kelly is with Jack.

Kelly takes in the scenic surroundings.

He measure her.  Then--

A beat.  Might as well tell.

There.  She said it.  He stares back.

We then HEAR the SOUND OF A DESCENDING HELICOPTER.  She looks

up.  Then:

As HECTOR CYR, this giant ball of life, deboards his chopper--

Kelly yanks him aside.

And it did a little.  Hector is a big Teddy Bear.

EXT. LAKE - SUNSET

Keough and Kelly are in one canoe, Hector and Jack are alongside

in another.  Hector is operating one of his sophisticated sonar

devices.  The calm.  The still.  The beauty.

Suddenly there are ripples, fish breaking surface about thirty

feet away.

Upon which something grabs the front of Kelly's canoe and with

one crisp yank, flips it over like a spoon on a dinner table,

sending them all flying.

In an instant, Keough and Kelly are swimming for their lives.

Screaming/yelling, they scramble for the canoe, climb onto it's

flipped-over back.  Breathless, they all exchange confused

looks.  "What the hell happened"?

EXT. CAMPSITE - SUNDOWN

Kelly, still in wet clothes, is talking on her portable phone.

Keough is there as Hector approaches.  Jack is approaching as

well.  Activity bustles in the b.g.

As DEPUTY SHARON GARE approaches--

Keough looks over.

They all walk over.

ANGLE THE GROUND

There's hundreds, maybe a thousand worms squirming,

surrounding... a human toe.

RESUME

Hector studies it, picks it up.  Then--

Keough deadpans back.  Then--

Hector gives the toe to Keough, then heads off.  Keough stands

there, holding the tow, as we:

EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

Kelly is testing a MACHINE that sends out little SQUEAKY SOUNDS,

as Jack approaches.  He stops.  Takes a second to... well,

admire her.  She's an attractive woman.  He then approaches.

A beat, as she tends to her work.

She looks.

Upon which, Jack tosses a rock over her shoulder.  As it makes

a splash, she screams and practically jumps into his arms.

Then:

And she heads off.  OFF Jack, we:

EXT. HECTOR'S TENT - NIGHT

Two deputies are digging deep pits about thirty feet in front of

his tent.  From within we HEAR MUSIC, the SOUNDS of a PARTY.

Keough approaches... looks at Deputy Burke, who's digging.

Keough continues on toward the tent.

INT. HECTOR'S TENT - CONTINUOUS

His tent is on the palatial side.  Stereo, generator, he's got a

margarita bar going.  There's a party.  Hector's dancing with

Deputy Gare, others are enjoying the drinks and MUSIC.

Upon which, Keough enters, doesn't like what he sees.

He goes, turns OFF the MUSIC.

They start to leave.

And they all go, including Gare, who shrugs to Keough "he's kind

of funny".

Keough stares back.

And Keough leaves, to:

EXT. CAMPSIGHT - CONTINUOUS

As Keough heads off--

A CAMPFIRE

REVEAL--

EXT. BEACH CAMPSITE - NIGHT

Kelly stands, alone, skipping stones.  After a beat, Jack

approaches.

A beat.

And her face falls.

A beat. He doesn't finish the sentence.

Jack reads her, he can see that she does.

There's a little chemistry here, though both would probably deny

it.  He heads off toward his tent, she sits with her book.  She

gives one last look, watches him go.  Then she goes back to her

book.

EXT. LAKE - MUCH LATER

The lake is still, the campfire is out, the tents are quiet.

The quiet SOUNDS of NIGHT.  CRICKETS.  A LOON.  An OWL.  A

courageous raccoon looks about, seeing what he can rummage.  By

the water... a black bear takes a drink.

ANGLE KEOUGH'S TENT

He emerges, compelled by a full bladder, wearing only his

trousers, carrying a revolver.  He walks into the nearby woods.

He removes from his shorts his bladder's connection to the

outside world.  Proceeds to URINATE.  Then... he hears

something.  The SOUND of RUSTLING LEAVES.  He STOPS URINATING,

we HEAR a HALF SECOND of MOVEMENT.  Then quiet.  Must be his

imagination.  He RESUMES his business.

More RUSTLING, it's not just the sound of dense urine against

leaves, he stops... something's out there in the darkness.

Quiet.  He starts up for a second, STOPS QUICKLY, and we HEAR it

for sure.  Something's RUSTLING TOWARDS him.  With his free

hand, Keough pulls out his revolver.  More RUSTLING... Keough

points the gun.  Something on the ground is coming toward him.

He moves slowly, gun drawn, into the darkness.  The RUSTLING is

getting LOUDER.  It's almost upon him.  A beat.  CLOSER.

CLOSER.  Then Keough peels away a bush revealing:

HECTOR

Looking into a gun barrel.  He screams.  Keough screams.  Then--

And now all the others, awakened, are charging.

And Hector storms off.  A beat.

A beat.

Keough shoots a look to Jack.

And Keough heads off, under--

Upon which, he disappears from Earth.  He's stepped into one of

Hector's pit traps.  A beat.

EXT. LAKE - SUNRISE

The steam is lifting off the lake.

EXT. LAKE - MORNING

Keough, Kelly, Hector, and Deputy Burke are cruising in the

whaler.  Hector and Jack are both in full diving gear.  Jack

also has a stick gun for protection.  Hector does not.

As if that's suppose to clear it up.  Keough stares back

blankly.  Then:

Burke lowers the anchor, as Keough just continues to stare at

Hector.  Kelly readies the hatchling recorder.  She lowers it

into the water.

There was a twinge of real concern in her voice.  He makes eye

contact with her.  Then drops over.  Goes under.

And Hector drops overboard.

Keough rolls his eyes.

EXT. UNDERWATER - ANGLE ON JACK - DAY

Jack, diving.  We HEAR the HIGH PITCH of CROCODILE HATCHLINGS.

Visibility is again pretty limited.

EXT. LAKE - ANGLE ON HECTOR - UNDERWATER - DAY

Hector dives through the dark black water.  Visibility is lousy.

EXT. UNDERWATER - THIRTY MINUTES LATER

Jack dives, searched.  Looks ahead, sees something... He moves

closer... it's the carcass of the moose, no head.

EXT. LAKE - AN HOUR LATER

Kelly and Keough onboard.

A beat.

EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY

Jack and Hector, diving together.

EXT. LAKE - TWO HOURS LATER

The boats sit still on the dead calm water.  Kelly works the

RADAR, Keough covertly eats a Twinkie.

They both scan the surface.  Dead calm.

EXT. UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS

Hector moves about.  We can hear the HATCHLING RECORDER, but

he's not seeing anything.

EXT. UNDERWATER - (ANOTHER AREA) - CONTINUOUS

Jack looks about.  He looks up.  Doesn't see much but he gets an

eerie feeling.  Something's out there.

EXT. LAKE - CONTINUOUS

Keough, Kelly, and Burke, standing idly, scanning the calm

surface.

A beat.  Another beat.  Then... something jerks the boat a

little.

Upon which something really yanks the boat.  So hard... Kelly

flips over the back, into the water.

The boat is moving, being dragged quickly.

But Kelly's alone in the water, the boat being pulled away.

RESUME

Burke goes to work on the anchor line as we ANGLE Kelly,

treading water, in the middle of nowhere.  She's completely

vulnerable.

EXT. UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS

Hector, swimming for the surface.

EXT. LAKE - CONTINUOUS

Kelly, treading water.  FIND Keough on the boat, he now has the

engine running, fighting against the drag but whatever has that

boat has a fucking strong hold.

And finally, as he severs the rope the boat almost goes airborne

with a jump, Burke nearly sails out.  Keough's boat then races

to Kelly.

ANGLE KELLY

Suddenly about thirty feet away... we SEE fish breaking water.

The boat is zooming toward her.  It arrives.  As Keough and

Burke go to pull her aboard, we see a dark shadow rising.

And Jack explodes out of the water, it was his shadow.  Keough

and Burke pull them both aboard.

EXT. UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS

Hector is swimming toward the surface.  Suddenly... a shadow

looms over him.  He looks up.

HIS P.O.V.

There is no boat.  We can't see it, just a big shadowy mass.

RESUME HECTOR

He's scared.

EXT. LAKE - CONTINUOUS

EXT. UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS

Hector is still charging toward the surface.  The lack of

visibility is frightening, something could be six feet away and

he wouldn't know it.

EXT. LAKE - CONTINUOUS

Keough quickly maneuvers the boat to where Kelly indicated,

under--

And Keough has the boat to him as Hector breaks surface.

And they quickly pull Hector on board, all attention is on

Hector as they lean over to rescue him.  On the far right... two

eyes... moving closer to the oblivious rescuers.

Slowly moving in, everybody is so preoccupied with Hector,

Deputy Burke, at the end of the boat, is leaning way over to see

Hector.  If only he knew what he's not seeing.  The eyes come

closer.  They're now in the water right below Burke's head.  How

can he not see it?  A beat.  Another beat.  Then... suddenly, a

mouth, a dragon, teeth, something, flashes from the water--

snap.  And Deputy Burke's head is simply gone as his limp body

hangs over the boat.  Kelly screams in horror.

In a microsecond, Burke's head and life are both gone.  OFF

their stunned faces, as Kelly continues to scream we:

EXT. CAMPSITE - SUNSET

Burke's body is being loaded into an ambulance.  People move in

silence, the wake of tragedy.  A few State Troopers are on the

scene.

PAN TO FIND Kelly, staring almost blankly, as Jack, finishing a

phone call, approaches.  He measures her expression, she's still

in shock.

ANGLE KELLY

She is visibly undone, she appears almost to be fighting off

shock.  Jack puts his hands on her shoulder to steady her.

Jack can see she's willing herself to be stoic.

She nods, appreciatively.  Part of her would love to collapse

into him but a bigger part demands that she remain stoic.

PAN TO FIND Keough, walking.  Still visibly shaken.  He

unwittingly approaches Hector.  They hold a look.

A beat.

A beat.  Then--

Keough turns to stare at him with incredulity.

Keough has had enough of this guy.

And Keough heads off.  He takes about four steps... then SNAP.

Up goes his upside-down body like a rocket.  He's stepped in

Hector's spring-bow trap.  A beat.  He swings upside-down like

a pendulum.  Another beat.

EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

Kelly and Jack.

She just stares out as if she didn't hear.  And he fixes his own

stare on her.  Feeling it, she turns, catches him looking at

her, he diverts the stare.  She feigns a non-reaction.  A beat.

EXT. CAMPSITE - SECONDS LATER

Hank hangs still, upside down, from the tree, as Hector, Kelly,

and Jack approach.

They arrive.  Hank says nothing, he hangs there perfectly still.

The three exchange looks.

Jack gives Kelly a knife.

Hector and Jack grab hold, Kelly cuts, they lower him to the

ground.  He rises.

And he charges after Hector, who runs toward the beach.  Keough

chases, Jack and Kelly pursue, trying to stop him.  And

suddenly, exploding out of the woods, a ferocious charging

GROWL.  An attack.  Screams all over, a half-second of confusion

before we SEE it's a large BLACK BEAR jumping out of the

darkness, right at Hector.  Hector dives out of its path.

Screams, panic, shouting, as the bear rears up on his hind legs.

Seemingly about to lunge when... exploding out of the water

the giant jaws of a crocodile.

In a flash instant, the beast engulfs the bear, twisting it,

slamming it on the ground and then pulling it into the water.

The bear fights back ferociously for a second but there can only

be one outcome here.  In a matter of seconds, both bear and

crocodile have vanished.  And the water is calm again.

ANGLE THE FACES

Utter catatonia.  Shock.  Whatever they expected to find in this

expedition, they weren't remote prepared for that.  There are

no words here.  Shock is pre-empting every other human sensory.

What they just saw... a crocodile head measuring five feet rise

up out of the water and gobbled a fucking bear.  A beat.  Then--

A beat as they gulp air.

There is a little blood over Jack's right eye.  He dabs it.

Another beat.

And Keough starts for him, but Jack intercedes.

Keough throws a haymaker, decking Hector.  Lays him out.

And he's gone.

She looks at his hand on her arm, which suddenly makes him self-

consious.

They hold a look.

EXT. LAKE (WESTSIDE) - NIGHT

We are at a small clearing on the other side of the lake.  A

four-wheel-drive of some sort is bumping down a fairly

unpassable dirt road into the clearing.

As the jeep comes more INTO VIEW, we REVEAL its occupants to be

six teenagers, including Janine, and TOM, STEVE, DANNY, CAROL,

ELLEN.  They've been drinking but they're not sloppy drunk.  As

they climb out, Tom points to a swing rope which extends from

the branch of a tree that overhangs the water.

Could be more like first one in.  The teenagers begin to strip

off their clothes.  As they giggle and laugh we:

INT. KELLY'S TENT - NIGHT

Kelly is butterflying Jack's wound, necessarily working very

close to him.

They hold a look.  Then --

Jack nods slightly.

Their eyes are locked now, making her self-conscious and

nervous.

Something is happening right now.  A beat.

The Freudian slip of her life.  They hold another look.  Then he

starts to exit.  He stops at the door, turns back.

He holds another look, then leaves.  OFF her punishing herself

for both the slip of the tongue and for cutting the moment

short.

EXT.  LAKE (WESTSIDE) - NIGHT

The teenagers are now skinny-dipping, having a grand ol'

flirtatious time.  As they splash and frolic and cop their

feels, we ANGLE... about fifty yards away.  Two eyes pop above

the surface... followed by the snout.  GO TO:

THE CROC'S P.O.V.

Six fresh delicious teenagers.  Midnight buffet.

RESUME

the croc as he slowly starts to move.  The teenagers start to

take turns, swinging on a rope from a branch which overhangs the

shoreline.  As they laugh and yell, Danny swings on a long

rope... landing with a splash.  About ten feet from the croc,

waiting stealth-like, his eyes barely above surface.  He could

easily go for Danny... but he somehow knows the service will get

better.  As Danny swims back to shore, Janine takes hold of the

rope.

And she swings away... a better swing than Danny's... and she

splashes down about five feet from the eyes.  Again, the eyes

don't move.  The teenagers cheer Janine's record-setting swing

as Tom takes hold of the rope.

And he flies away.  It's a leap to die for.  As he splashes

down... gulp.  Like a seal grabbing a fish... and Tommy has

vanished.  The kids, cheering at the leap, stop cheering when

Tommy fails to resurface.  A beat.  They first think he's

playing a joke.

Another beat.  Still no sign of Tommy.

And now they're concerned.  They all move down toward the shore.

And now they're starting to panic.

Suddenly-- thrusting up out of the water.  The crocodile, Tommy

in its jaws.  Bloodcurdling screams from all as we:

EXT. CAMPSITE - NIGHT

Hector and Keough both hear the screams of the teenagers.

EXT. LAKE - NIGHT

Keough, Jack, and Deputy Stevens are in the boat, zooming

towards the teenagers.

INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT

Hector and Kelly are flying toward the area, the search beams

are on.

CLOSE ON JANINE

REVEAL

EXT. LAKE (WESTSIDE) - NIGHT

The teenagers have some or most of their clothes back on.

Hector's chopper is hovering over the area, its beams lighting

the water.  Lying on the beach, covered... is Tommy.  Alive.

And basically unhurt!

Tommy nods.  Then--

Keough and Jack exchange a look of disbelief.

EXT. CAMPSITE - AN HOUR LATER

Hector, Keough, Jack, and Kelly, looking tired, trek toward

their tents.

They're growing on each other.  Jack and Kelly exchange a smile.

Hector and Keough are developing an odd kinship almost.  They

continue on as Jack and Kelly stop at her tent.

She smiles.  Then:

He holds another look.  She goes into her tent.  He stands

there.  A beat.  Waits to see if she calls him back.  She

doesn't.  He then heads off.  Her head pops out.  Watches him

go.  Almost calls after him.  Doesn't.

EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

We see the campsite, looking at it from the water.  All is

still.  After a beat.  An eye blink.  We are not looking at the

campsite.  We are CLOSE ON an EYE, REFLECTING the campsite.

Another blink.  Still another.  We HEAR a slight SNARL.  Then:

EXT. LAKE - SUNRISE

Hector and Deputy Gare, inside the chopper, lifting of, to

begin an early morning search.

EXT. SHORE - (DIFFERENT PART OF THE LAKE) - SUNRISE

Kelly, Jack, Keough, and Stevens searching for tracks along the

wooded shoreline, staying a good six feet from the actual shore.

Their senses are very heightened.  Keough has his cannon gun.

He's staring at a brush thicket.  After a beat, we HEAR a slight

RUSTLE.  The guns go up quickly.  A beat.  Nothing.  Jack bends

down, picks up a stone.  Tosses it into the thicket.  And out it

charges.  Kelly screams, they're all about to fire before they

realize it's only a beaver.  It scurries into the water.

ANGLE A GIANT PAW PRINT

embedded in the mud.  It must be two feet in diameter.

RESUME

Kelly and Jack go quickly to examine the print.

EXT. LAKE - CONTINUOUS

The chopper is descending.  Hector and Gare are inside.

EXT. SHORE - CONTINUOUS

Kelly and Jack are still working on the footprint.  Physical

proximity, which they're both a little distracted by.

Suddenly another beaver scurries out from underfoot, scaring all

of them, but particularly Kelly who jumps.  Her foot lands on a

long extended branch, and even more suddenly Burke's severed

head seesaws out of the shallow water, hitting her in the shin.

She screams as they all jump back.

ANGLE THE HEAD

RESUME

They just stare, as Kelly continues to scream.

She takes a couple of calming breaths.

Keough takes a stick.  Squeamish, he tentatively pokes the head,

trying to turn it over.

ANGLE THE HEAD

It is Burke.

RESUME

Keough leans in for a closer look.

Something appears to be in his mouth.  Keough takes a small

twig, pries back a cheek... the mouth is full of worms.

THEIR P.O.V.

About a hundred yards north, Mrs. Bickerman is leading a

blindfolded cow to the water.

RESUME

Kelly raises her binoculars.  So does Jack.

THEIR P.O.V.

There waiting... mouth fully open... is the fucking crocodile.

RESUME

Kelly, Jack, and Keough, as they lower their scopes.  They look

at each other, then back at the foregoing.

EXT. BICKERMAN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Mrs. Bickerman, singing "Itsy Bitsy Spider" is happily leading

the blinded cow to the shore.  The cow, tentative, just allows

itself to be led, not knowing what the plan is.  As Mrs.

Bickerman gets to the water, she looks out to the croc.

And with that, she whips the hind of the cow causing it to jump

forward.  Almost simultaneously, the croc makes its charge and

the cow is dead before it has a clue.

ANGLE JACK, KEOUGH, AND KELLY

utterly agape.  After a long beat:

INT. BICKERMAN HOUSE - DAY

Keough, Kelly, and Jack are questioning a slightly hostile Mrs.

Bickerman.

Keough, Kelly and Jack can't quite believe what they're hearing.

Then--

EXT. LAKE - CONTINUOUS

The chopper, free-floating, is drifting near a small cove.

Hector, in diving gear, is about to go into the water, as Gare

tries to dissuade.

As he drops in.

INT. BICKERMAN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Kelly, Jack and Keough with Bickerman.

EXT. LAKE - UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS

Hector is underwater, exploring.

ANGLE GARE ON THE CHOPPER

Her radar is up, she heard something.  But she doesn't see

anything.  She scans the surface closely.

EXT. LAKE - UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS

The water is slightly more visible as Hector swims.  Other than

the odd school of fish, an otter, a snapping turtle... nothing

extraordinary.  Then, a flash shadow looms over him.  He looks

up, but sees nothing.  Probably just the sun ducking under a

cloud.  It does make him sufficiently nervous, however, to head

for the surface.  He swims upward.

EXT. LAKE (SURFACE) - CONTINUOUS

Hector breaks the top.  Lifts his mask, looks toward the

chopper, which he sees about forty yards out.  He continues to

breaststroke on the surface.  Suddenly... the croc's head rises

up right behind Hector, who's oblivious.  He continues to swim.

The croc follows.  Then... maybe divine intuition... Hector gets

a feeling he's being followed.  He then turns to look the other

way, upon which his face goes rigid.

HIS P.O.V.

About three feet from his nose... are two giant eyes staring at

him.

ANGLE HECTOR

ashen.

The croc doesn't move.  It just stares at him.  Then end of his

snout is almost touching Hector.  Hector himself doesn't dare

move, for fear of spooking the croc into action.  We get the

idea that looking into the eyes of this crocodile is not filling

any spiritual voids.  A beat.

The croc raises his head now to reveal the snout.  And his

deadly smile.  Hector just tries to tread water with as little

motion as possible.  He deathly fears a quick movement will

cause his life to be over.  Perhaps this is what he came for.

To be judged by this symbol of mythology.

He backswims ever so slightly.  The croc pursues just as slowly,

their eyes are locked.  He could snap off Hector's head in an

instant.

INT. SEA CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS

Gare still scans the water's surface, looking for any sign of

Hector.  And her face freezes.  Oh yes, there's the sign.

HER P.O.V.

Hector continues to backswim slowly to the plane and the croc

slowly follows.

We can hear the quaking fear in Hector's voice.  As he continues

to slowly backswim.

Gare turns the ignition, the ENGINE KICKS and DIES.

She turns it again and the ENGINE TURNS OVER.

ANGLE HECTOR

The crocodile is still right with him as they inch closer and

closer toward the chopper.

But nothing's funny about this to Hector now.  What he's staring

into is death.  His own.  Gare raises her rifle.

ANGLE GARE

ANGLE HECTOR

craning to see how far away he is and as soon as he breaks eye

contact with the CROCODILE, it GROWLS.  Hector quickly locks

eyes with him again.

ANGLE GARE

RESUME

By now Hector is almost to the chopper, the croc is right there

too.  Hector's right hand then goes slowly for his belt though

it's impossible to discern why.  The crocodile seems poised to

finish him.  There's a slight GROWL.

And then suddenly, a small underwater POP, followed by an

EXPLOSION out of the water.  it's an inflatable life vest and as

it pop tarts out of the water, the croc lunges for it.

As the croc goes for the vest, Hector makes his dash for the

chopper.  In almost an instant, he's climbing on board as the

croc pulls the vest into darkness underwater.

Hector's up on the chopper's ski.

The crocodile's head comes thrusting up, its massive jaws

snapping shut, missing Hector by an inch, maybe two.  Hector

dives into the chopper, screaming.

She REVS the CHOPPER.  The croc comes up again, chomping down on

one of the landing skis.  Both Gare and Hector scream as the

whole helicopter is jerked mightily.

The croc releases and the chopper rights itself and begins to

thrust off, when the croc surfaces again, mouth open.  Gare

FIRES her REVOLVER.  It might as well shoot BB's.  The croc is

undaunted but he does miss the ski and by now the chopper is up

and running, finally safely out of the reptile's reach.

EXT. CAMPSITE - TWENTY MINUTES LATER

Jack is nearly manhandling Hector, pulling him by the elbow

towards his tent.  Kelly and Keough are there too.

Jack simply grabs his arm and squeezes a pressure point.  Hector

yelps in pain.

Hector, feelings hurt, stomps off again.  Kelly looks at Jack.

Then Kelly follows Hector.

INT. HECTOR'S TENT - A MINUTE LATER

Hector enters, sits.  A beat.  Kelly enters, goes to sit next to

him.

He's sounding erratic.

And Hector drops the act.

He has trouble saying it.

She just whacks him.  Then exits.  OFF Hector, "worth a shot",

we:

EXT. CAMPSITE - DAY

Jack and Keough are there to meet Kelly.

They turn to see, Hector is standing there.

Hector's impassioned here, he's not fooling around.

Silence.  Admission by silence.  Then--

A beat.  They are sympathetic to the idea.

EXT. BICKERMAN'S HOUSE - AN HOUR LATER

We HEAR the CHOPPER.

And up goes Hector's chopper.  And... REVEAL connected to a long

cable... a cow.  An airborne cow, dangling from the chopper.

Jack turns to Kelly.

She shrugs.

INT. CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS

Hector pilots.

EXT. LAKE - CONTINUOUS

Hector's chopper is flying the befuddled animal toward the cove.

FIND Keough, Kelly, and Jack on the water cruising back to camp.

Keough has his gun.

EXT. CAMPSITE - TWENTY MINUTES LATER

Two pickup trucks have been backed in for a shooting vantage.

Kelly, Jack, Keough.  Riflemen are ready with tranq guns.

ANGLE JACK

RESUME

The chopper lowers the cow.  He starts to kick his legs in

anticipation.

And the cow goes into the water.  He swims frantically a few

meters.  The chopper lifts him out briefly.

EXT. LAKE - AN HOUR LATER

The cow has been dipped more times than a stale donut now and he

just hangs there like pasta.  Jack, Keough, and Kelly are poised

with tranq guns on the beach.

INT. CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS

ANGLE THE SCREEN

There's a mass... moving toward the cow.

EXT. BEACH - CONTINUOUS

They move into position.

INT. HECTOR'S CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS

EXT. LAKE - CONTINUOUS

Sure enough... that giant snout breaks the surface.  Ever so

calmly... it moves toward the cow.

EXT. BEACH - CONTINUOUS

ANGLE THE RADAR SCREEN

Depicting the same.

EXT. BEACH - CONTINUOUS

Hector's chopper, cow dangling, is slowly approaching the shore.

Behind it... the snout and eyes of a giant croc.  Back on the

shore, Keough's men ready themselves for action.  Tranq guns.

rifles... the team is mobilized.  We HEAR a DISTRESSED CRY from

the COW.

Incredibly... the plan is working.  A giant dragon is following

a dangled suspended cow to the shoreline.

Hector dangles the cow closer, they're now nearing shore.  The

big crocodile, eyes on the prize, is moving in for the flank

steak.  The time is now.

INT. CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS

EXT. BEACH - CONTINUOUS

The crocodile then suddenly thrusts up after the cow, snapping

at air.  Hector pulls up with the chopper.

Jack, Gare, and other officers pump the beast with tranq darts.

But Hector has taken his chopper up too fast, causing the cow to

swing like a pendulum.  It rocks the chopper.

INT. CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS

The chopper is in trouble.  The cow sways, the helicopter

struggles to stay airborne.

EXT. BEACH - ANGLE KELLY - CONTINUOUS

The men continue to pump the beast with tranquilizing darts.

INT. CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS

Hector's having trouble righting his chopper.

EXT. BEACH - CONTINUOUS

Suddenly the croc goes up and grabs the dangling cow, snapping

off the cable.

And down comes to the chopper, Hector cannot control it.  It

crashes into the lake.

Hector pops his head out of the overturned chopper.  He looks

around.

The men switch guns, under--

As the pick-up backs closer to the shore--

The water is calm again.  A beat.

Upon which the croc comes thrusting up out of the water charging

the truck.  Screams.

The pick-up spins dirt, lurches forward, throwing Keough off

balance.  The croc heads back for the water as Keough regains

his balance.

And Keough blasts.  It detonates the ground near the croc

causing him to surge airborne into the water.  And he goes

under.  Silence.  A beat.

ANGLE HECTOR

on the pontoon of his chopper.  He's looking about, studying the

water.

And as Hector looks further.  Behind him... up surfaces the

crocodile in all his stealth.  His head is two feet from Hector

and nobody knows it.  Least of all Hector.

And as he turns back, he sees it.  The croc comes up as Hector

screams, jumps off.  Screams.  Keough leaps off the truck and

charges into the shallow water with his gun, looking to give

Hector some cover.

Hector then resurfaces swimming to his bobbing chopper.  He

climbs in.

No sooner said than the croc comes launching up.  As he springs

toward the open chopper cabin, Hector, leaps out on the other

side.  The croc's head comes crashing clear through the cabin

and he becomes wedged.  The crocodile is stuck, he protrudes

right through the chopper.  He's not completely immobilized but

wherever he goes now, the helicopter is going with him.

But now Jack has joined, rifle in hand.  Hector surfaces again,

swimming for shore.  Jack runs to help him onto land.

But the croc looks feeble now.  He lets out this MOAN of DEATH.

And even Keough hesitates to pull the trigger.

RESUME

The croc, unable to dive, is now thrashing toward the beach.

But there's no rage in his behavior now.  He seems desperate.

He's taken some bullets, he's tired, he's wedged inside a two

ton piece of metal and he's exhausted.

Breathing heavily, he lumbers into the shallow water, unable to

free himself from the mangled wreckage.  As unbelievable as that

cow looked dangling from this very chopper, the sight is even

more astonishing, if not preposterous, now.  A thirty foot

exhausted crocodile is wearing the broken helicopter.  And he

just cannot go on anymore.

Kelly, Hector, Jack, Keough, stare back.  They approach with

caution.  They all stare at the tired crocodile.

ANGLE THE CROC

He's now looking back.  Bleeding, gasping... beaten.  In his

eyes... we can see it.  The beast is beaten.

ANGLE THE PRINCIPLES

There's no triumph.  In their eyes... sadness.

It continues to breathe heavily.

Keough raises his cannon.

Upon which, a twenty footer, another croc, thrusts up out of the

water, seizing Hector.  Screams.  It death rolls Hector, flings

him out of his mouth and in seconds, he's coming up for more.

Keough blasts his Avenger.  A direct hit.

It takes the smaller croc's head right off sending it sailing

into the air.  It splashes down, the first head not to hit

Kelly.

They all then go for Hector, pulling him to shore.  He's

bleeding.

Keough quickly peels off his shirt.  Gives it to Kelly, who goes

to work.

A sudden ROAR.  Kelly screams as Jack and Keough wheel to see...

the big croc.  Maybe his final roar, he looks weak.  GASPING in

the crashed chopper.  Jack and Keough approach.

But something about this crocodile... his eyes looking back at

them... nobody wants wants to take him out.

ANGLE THE CROC

looking back at them.  He knows he's in their hands now.  He

knows.

ANGLE THE HUMANS

A beat.

Upon which we HEAR the SOUND of TRUCKS.  Florida Fish And Game,

U.S. Wildlife, arriving on the scene.

OFFICER COLSON, Florida Fish And Game, emerges, approaches.

Stares with utter disbelief.

By now the Florida army has moved in.  They all stare with the

same suspended disbelief.

EXT. BEACH - AN HOUR LATER

A crew, including vets, are working on the sedated croc, trying

to free it from the wreckage.  FIND the PARAMEDICS with Hector,

on a stretcher.  Jack, Kelly, and Keough are there.

Hector smiles.

Jack leans down.

He looks to Kelly, but before she can say "yes"--

Hector smiles.  The Paramedics board Hector.  Keough turns to

Jack.

Handshake.  Respect.  That's about as much affection as you get

from Keough.  He then extends his hand to Kelly.

And she kisses him on the cheek.  Keough fights off his blush,

boards the chopper.  As it then lifts up, Kelly turns to Jack.

They hold a look.  Then--

And she kisses his cheek.

They hold another look.

He smiles.

He kisses her hand.  Holds a look.  Heads off.

EXT. BEACH - DUSK

The tents are down, everything's packed.  A couple trucks

remain.  The croc is gone.  Things are quiet.  Kelly stands down

by the water, staring out.

HER P.O.V.

Hypnotic beauty.  The lake doesn't even ripple.  She soaks it in

as if she knows it may be a while before she ever gets close to

this again.  She HEARS every BIRD.  Including a DISTANT LOON.

Serenity has returned.  Then suddenly... a stone goes skipping

out, four, five, six skips.  Kelly turns around.  Jack stands

there.  They hold a look.

He approaches.  Takes her hand.

They hold a look.  He kisses her softly.

And they kiss again, this one escalates a little.  They break.

And then he holds her.  Tightly as the CAMERA PULLS UP to an

AERIAL VIEW of them, embracing at the water's edge.

EXT. MAINE TURNPIKE - AERIAL SHOT - DUSK

Police cars, lights flashing, motor down the highway.  Behind

them... on a flatbed truck... a thirty foot giant crocodile.

Headed down the southbound lane of the Maine turnpike.  Rolling.

Rolling.  Rolling along.  It doesn't even look ridiculous.

We've become accustomed to such sights.

As we lift up higher and higher, Richie Havens' "I CAN SEE

CLEARLY NOW" RESUMES.  Eventually, we:

EXT. CAMPSITE - SUNSET

Jack and Kelly board his vehicle.  They drive off, as we:

EXT. BICKERMAN FARM - SUNSET

Daffy Mrs. Bickerman sits at the end of her dock, feet dangling

in the water.  Throwing bread crumbs.

REVEAL

Three, maybe four, crocodile hatchlings, a foot in length, are

swimming near her feet, eating the bread, nibbling her toes.

OFF them, THEN happy Mrs. Bickerman, we:
