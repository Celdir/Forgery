EXT JERSEY CITY- DAY

Dec 21st. Clear sky, snow on the ground. Cold as fuck. With

the sounds of laughter and music, we MOVE IN ON:

INT NEWSPAPER OFFICE- DAY

An office Xmas party in progress, not a pretty sight: tipsy

receptionists laugh and spill drinks on the rug, red-faced

reporters loosen their belts and burp cocktail weiners...

MOVING QUICKLY THROUGH THE PARTY TO AN OPEN OFFICE DOOR.

Arriving just in time for the door to SLAM in our face.

INT OFFICE- DAY

A woman stomps back over to her desk and picks up her pen.

MEET CASSIDY DALEY (dirty blond, striking, manic energy). Ink-

stained fingers, notepads in every pocket: Cass doesn't have

time for office parties, she's working.

Her door cracks open and STEWART (almost as good looking as

he thinks he is) appears, holding a Kahlua bottle.

Cass picks up a stapler and LAUNCHES it at Stewart's head.

Stewart DUCKS OUT just in time. The phone rings. Answering:

Cass is on her feet, excited.

CLICK. He hangs up. Cass drops the phone, grabs her stuff.

INT NEWSPAPER OFFICE- DAY

Cass races for the elevator, Stewart hot on her heels:

Stewart considers this, then hands her 5 20's.

She exits. He shouts after her:

EXT STREET/JERSEY CITY- DAY

Cass driving like a maniac, doing the one thing she loves:

TRACKING A STORY...

EXT DUNKING DONUTS PARKING LOT- DAY

MOVING IN ON- A BEAT-UP HONDA CIVIC (JIMMY'S CAR) IN THE BACK

CORNER OF THE LOT...

INT JIMMY'S CAR- DAY

JIMMY (20's, goatee, Mets baseball hat, nervous) sits in his

car, rolling a cigarette while he waits for Cass.

Jimmy puts the cigarette in his mouth and pulls out a

lighter. Just as he flips the lighter open, HIS FRONT

WINDSHIELD EXPLODES. A MAN HOLDING A TIRE IRON (MAHLER,

heavyset, crew-cut, rarely speaks, all business) reaches

through the broken window, AND DRAGS JIMMY OUT OF THE CAR...

EXT DUNKING DONUTS PARKING LOT- DAY

Cass drives into the lot and pulls up next to Jimmy's car.

She realizes he is not in the car. THEN SHE SEES THE BROKEN

GLASS ALL OVER THE DRIVER'S SEAT.

SCREECHING TIRES behind her. Cass glances up and sees JIMMY'S

BASEBALL HAT IN THE BACK WINDOW OF A GREY CHEVY. The Chevy is

racing out into traffic. Cass throws her car into reverse...

INT CASS' CAR- DAY

Cass tries to follow the grey Chevy, but GETS STUCK AT A RED

LIGHT. Shit. She looks around, decides fuck it, and HITS THE

GAS. Her car leaps into the intersection. SIRENS.

Cass looks into her rearview mirror: A PATROL CAR IS RIGHT

BEHIND HER, signalling for her to pull over. Up ahead, the

Chevy is getting away.

Cass debates: pull over? Or follow the story? No contest. SHE

SLAMS ON THE GAS AND HER CAR SURGES OUT OF FRAME...

EXT STREET- DAY

Cass' car SPEEDS down the street, A COP CAR IN CLOSE

PURSUIT...

INT CASS' CAR- DAY

Cass is losing sight of the Chevy. She races around traffic

and is suddenly HEADED STRAIGHT FOR THE SIDE OF A MOVING VAN.

She panics, WRENCHING the wheel to the right...

EXT STREET- DAY

CASS' CAR JUMPS THE CURB, CROSSES A LAWN, AND SKIDS TO A HALT

ON THE FRONT STEPS OF A CHURCH. THE COP CAR RACES UP AND

BLOCKS HER IN.

EXT CHURCH- MOMENTS LATER

Cass is out of her car now, arguing with a cop who has her by

the arm:

The cop pulls her towards his squad car. Cass leans over and

SINKS HER TEETH INTO THE COP'S HAND. The cop screams.

FREEZE FRAME.

CHIRON: "24 HOURS LATER"

CLOSE ON- A NEWSPAPER COLUMN WITH CASS' PHOTO: windswept

hair, head tilted coyly, smile that says "I'm on top of the

world. Beneath the photo, the byline: "CASSIDY DALEY".

Someone whistles "We Wish You a Merry Xmas" as a MARKER

improves on the photo: MOUSTACHE, BUCK-TEETH, PIMPLES. Then a

MATCH enters frame, and SETS THE PHOTO ON FIRE.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

INT CRYSTAL'S BAR/JERSEY CITY- LATE AFTERNOON

Holding the flaming photo, MEET MILO: rumpled shirt, messy

hair, looks like he slept on the floor. The bartender

(CRYSTAL, 50's, Eastern European) scowls at him:

He drops the flaming photo to the floor, pours his drink on

it, then GRINDS IT TO PIECES WITH HIS SHOE.

He points to A DRUNK DRAPED OVER THE JUKEBOX, MOURNFULLY

SINGING ALONG TO CHRISTINA AQUILLERA'S "I AM BEAUTIFUL".

Pointing to A WOMAN TRYING TO RIP A PAY PHONE FROM THE WALL.

Glances at the TV, which is showing LIVE FOOTAGE OF AN XMAS

PARADE. Looks closer, recognizes someone, groans:

Tosses back his drink and SPLITS.

EXT CRYSTAL'S BAR- LATE AFTERNOON

Milo climbs into a Cadillac: dents, patches of rust, cracked

windshield, bumper askew.

RACK TO: half a block away, A DARK SEDAN IDLES AT THE CURB.

INT DARK SEDAN- LATE AFTERNOON

The man behind the wheel (DWIGHT, large, babyfaced, Metallica

t-shirt) eats a hoagie as he watches Milo get into his car.

He takes a last bite then tosses the sandwich and pulls away

from the curb, tailing the Cadillac.

EXT JERSEY CITY- LATE AFTERNOON

MOVE IN ON- the parade we just saw on TV. Baton twirlers in

Santa Hats. Men dressed like reindeer, pulling a sleigh. A

boys choir singing "Joy to the World", the kids dressed like

orphans that escaped a Broadway musical.

A beautiful scene, if you like that sort of thing.

RACK TO- the Cadillac, half a block away, cruising sideways

into a spot just beneath a "TEMPORARY TOW-AWAY" sign. MILO

climbs out of the car. Shoves his way through the crowd to

the curb, cracking open a can of Pabst.

Milo does not like this sort of thing. He scans the crowd

impatiently.

Meanwhile, THE CAR THAT WAS FOLLOWING HIM parks half a block

away. DWIGHT emerges and heads for:

MILO, who has just found what he's looking for. The reindeer

are passing him and he makes eye contact with RUDOLPH, who

does a double-take.

Milo takes a step towards Rudolph and DWIGHT APPEARS IN

MILO'S PATH, BLOCKING HIM.

Suddenly, DWIGHT PUNCHES MILO IN THE GUT. Milo doubles-up,

gasping, then BRINGS HIS HEAD UP QUICK, CATCHING DWIGHT ON

THE CHIN. Dwight goes flying sideways and MEETS A POLICE

BARRIER FACE-FIRST. Ouch.

The barrier tips over, knocking over the one next to it. THE

REST GO LIKE DOMINOS. Milo turns to see that RUDOLPH HAS

DISAPPEARED. Then he catches sight of the ANTLERS, working

their way through the crowd. Milo lunges after him and

Rudolph drags other reindeer with him as he tries to avoid

Milo. THE SLEIGH FLIPS. Santa tumbles from the sled. PACKAGES

RAIN DOWN ON REINDEER LIKE SHRAPNEL.

All of a sudden, IT'S THE XMAS FROM HELL: BLOODY REINDEER

STUMBLING AROUND, SANTA UNCONSCIOUS IN THE GUTTER, KIDS

SCREAMING, PARENTS PANICKING. Meanwhile, MILO IS GAINING ON

RUDOLPH, who picks up one of the packages and throws it. IT

CRACKS MILO IN THE HEAD. Just what Milo has been waiting for:

Milo TACKLES RUDOLPH TO THE GROUND. Around them, people

scream and scatter. One boy bursts into tears:

SIRENS. Uh-oh. Cops SWARM the scene, surrounding Milo and

Rudolph, GUNS DRAWN. The LEAD COP (GELMAN, short, over-

zealous) steps forward:

Release the reindeer? Milo looks around. He's got 8 or so

guns pointed his way and Rudolph gasping at his feet. MILO

STARTS TO LAUGH. Gelman bristles:

Milo flashes his ID. Gelman inspects it, rolls his eyes.

Gelman turns bright red.

Suddenly, a sergeant (BOBBY, late 30's, obnoxious but

likeable, Milo's ex-partner) marches onto the scene, takes

one look at Milo and laughs.

RACK TO- DWIGHT, NOSE BLEEDING, MELTING BACK INTO SHADOW...

EXT STREET- MOMENTS LATER

Milo drags Rudolph through the crowd towards his car. Bobby

follows, shaking his head, bemused expression on his face.

Just then, they come to where Milo left his car. IT'S GONE.

Bobby squints at the huge "TOW-AWAY" sign:

And with that, Milo loses it:

He rips the sign off the pole. Stomps on it. Kicks it. Tries

to shred it with his teeth. Hmm. He doesn't really seem like

the happiest man alive. Rudolph, to Bobby:

INT BOBBY'S CAR- EARLY EVENING

Bobby's car is decorated with photos of his many children,

all of whom look exactly like him, even the girls, poor kids.

Milo's in front by Bobby, Rudolph's handcuffed in the back.

Rudolph snickers. Milo does not. Bobby glances at Milo.

Milo reaches back, gags Rudolph with his own scarf.

EXT POLICE STATION/JERSEY CITY- EARLY EVENING

They pull up. Milo exits the car, pulls Rudolph from the

back. Bobby leans out.

Bobby really seems worried, but Milo waves him off. Bobby

drives over, parks by other cop cars. Gets out, mingles with

some cops. Laughter, inside jokes. Milo watches from afar.

Milo gags Rudolph and drags him into the station.

FADE TO BLACK. OVER BLACK:

INT SID'S BAIL BONDS/JERSEY CITY- MORNING

Hazy pieces: a tilting clock on the wall. A battered metal

desk. Filing cabinets, spitting up papers. A man, SID (wound

sorta tight, Milo's best friend) peers down at us:

Milo unsticks his face from the leather couch, wobbles

upright. Are the walls throbbing, or is it just him?

Milo grunts. Sid hands him a coffee.

Milo holds out his hand, palm up. Sid COUNTS MONEY INTO HIS

PALM.

EXT SID'S BAIL BONDS/JERSEY CITY- MORNING

Swearing under his breath, Sid is trying to stuff a Xmas tree

into the back of a station wagon. At least half of the tree

is hanging out of the back. Milo drinks a beer and watches.

Sid glares at him. Milo sighs, puts down his beer, and grabs

part of the tree.

Sid checks him out.

The tree is definitely not going to fit. They let it go, and

Sid pulls out a small hand saw.

Sid starts hacking away at the tree.

Sid drops the saw. With one final shove, the tree is in.

Phew. Sid slams the back shut.

He reaches into his pocket and extracts A FOLDED PIECE OF

PAPER. Hands it to Milo. Milo unfolds it, gives it a quick

look. A second look. A third.

TIME STOPS. THE WHOLE STREET GOES SILENT.

Milo gives him a questioning look.

Milo snorts.

Milo takes a deep, calming breath. Then he EXPLODES into

whoops and hollers. He throws himself into a snow bank and

thrashes around. He does a Fred Astaire around a lamp post.

Milo grabs Sid and pulls him into a crushing bear hug.

TERESA (mid 40's, overly made-up, popping gum) pokes her head

out the front door:

Milo drops Sid, grabs Teresa, and gives HER A LONG, INTENSE

KISS. He releases her. She stumbles back a bit.

He reaches into his mouth, extracts her gum and hands it to

her. She retreats back inside. Milo beams at Sid.

Sid shakes his head.

Famous last words. Sid is regretting his decision as he

watches Milo go dancing down the street...

CHRIRON: "DEC 23RD. 9:00AM. 48 HOURS TO GO."

With the sound of multiple ringing phones, cut to:

INT WAREHOUSE/ATLANTIC CITY- DAY

QUICK TRACKING SHOT OF LORRAINE (50's, bleached blond, built

like a trucker), as she talks on the phone and paces the

room, giving us glimpses of a major illegal bookie operation:

TV screens everywhere, a huge blackboard posting odds, men on

computers, several heavily armed private security guards...

She comes to a sudden stop at:

REVEAL DWIGHT, the guy who tried to collect from Milo,

SPORTING TWO BLACK EYES AND A BROKEN NOSE.

He did not. Lorraine scowls. "LUCK BE A LADY" KICKS IN:

EXT- DAY

Milo gets his car out of impound.

INT BARBERSHOP- DAY

Milo gets a cut and a shave.

EXT BARBERSHOP- DAY

Milo gets his shoes shined.

INT MILO'S APT- DAY

A freshly showered and shaved Milo packs for the job, singing

at the top of his lungs:

He puts an empty duffle on the bed and starts filling it:

MACE, PEPPER SPRAY, TASER GUN, HANDCUFFS...

He stares at his collection and smiles:

Milo zips up the bag.

EXT MILO'S APT- DAY

Milo tosses the duffle in the backseat. He pulls out the job

sheet and inspects it. CASS' CELL PHONE NUMBER IS LISTED.

Pulls out his cell phone, then hesitates. He glances around

and sees a PAY PHONE ACROSS THE WAY.

Pockets his cell phone and crosses to the pay phone.

EXT STREET- DAY

CASS, expensive leather jacket, boots, dark glasses, trying

to be incognito. Hurrying towards her car when she sees SOME

COPS EXIT A DINER up ahead. She slips into a doorway, waiting

for them to pass, when her phone rings.

She checks it ("PAY PHONE") and answers:

SPLIT-SCREEN

Nope, NOT JIMMY. Milo doesn't speak. Cass listens for a

moment. She can hear breathing. What the fuck? An evil grin

crosses Milo's face. Cass goes pale.

Milo takes a step forward. Cass takes a step back. Milo

LUNGES and CASS DROPS HER PHONE AND BOLTS OUT OF FRAME.

EXT PAY PHONE- DAY

Milo smirks at the receiver.

INT SID'S BAIL BOND'S- DAY

Sid shuts his door, then speaks into his phone, low:

He hangs up.

EXT STREET- DAY

Milo sips from a coffee cup and watches:

MILO'S POV- THE FRONT DOOR OF A FANCY BROWNSTONE. A woman

with a toy poodle emerges from the building, struggling with

the heavy door..

EXT BROWNSTONE- DAY

Milo appears next to the woman and holds the door for her:

The woman exits and Milo enters.

CLOSE ON- PANNING SHOT PAST DOORS: 301, 302, 303...

INT APT HALLWAY- DAY

Milo stops in front of 303, and knocks on the door.

No answer. Milo glances around, then works the lock...

INT APARTMENT/LIVING-ROOM- CONTINUOUS

Milo slips inside, pulling the door shut behind him. It's

dark and quiet. He glides through the room, scoping it out.

The place is huge, white rug and couch, flat screen TV.

And lining the bookshelves are FRAMED ARTICLES, AWARDS,

PHOTOS OF CASS WITH VARIOUS PUBLIC FIGURES: the home of a

successful and dedicated journalist.

Milo is halfway across the room when he realizes he has left

a set of MUDDY PRINTS across the formerly pristine white rug.

EXT APARTMENT/BACK DOOR- DAY

Cass enters frame. Nervous looks all around as she tries the

knob. Surprise: THE DOOR SWINGS OPEN. She hesitates.

INT APARTMENT/LIVING-ROOM- DAY

NOW THERE ARE FOOTPRINTS CRISS-CROSSING THE FLOOR, RUNNING UP

OVER THE COUCH, ETC. Looks like Milo had a little field day

here. He is taking a closer look at the shelves: no photos of

a boyfriend, family, pets: IT'S ALL WORK.

He picks up one of the framed articles with the headline

"LOCAL REPORTER WINS AWARD FOR BREAKING UP 13TH STREET DRUG

RING". There's a photo of CASS SHAKING HANDS WITH THE AN

IMPORTANT-LOOKING OFFICIAL.

Milo's face clouds over.

INT APARTMENT/KITCHEN- SIMULTANEOUS

Cass slips inside and the door swings shut behind her with a

soft CLICK.

INT APARTMENT/LIVING-ROOM- DAY

Milo's head whips around. SOMEONE'S IN THE KITCHEN. Big grin

as he replaces the frame and draws his gun. A couple careful

steps across the room and a floorboard CREAKS.

INT APARTMENT/KITCHEN- SIMULTANEOUS

Cass startles. SOMEONE'S IN THE LIVING-ROOM. Grabs a heavy

saucepan off the stove. Grips it like a weapon, soft-foots it

towards the hallway...

INT APARTMENT/LIVING-ROOM- DAY

Milo reaches the hallway entrance. Positions himself up

against the wall, waiting...

INT APARTMENT/HALLWAY- SIMULTANEOUS

Cass tiptoes down the hallway, saucepan at the ready...

INT APARTMENT/LIVING-ROOM- DAY

Milo holds his breath. A SHADOWY FIGURE STEPS INTO THE ROOM.

Milo puts his gun to their head:

RACK TO- THE PERSON'S FACE. IT'S NOT CASS, IT'S STEWART.

INT APARTMENT/HALLWAY- SIMULTANEOUS

Cass takes a breath and LUNGES...

INT APARTMENT/LIVING-ROOM- DAY

...SWINGING THE PAN, SCREAMING LIKE A BANSHEE:

THE PAN CONNECTS SOLIDLY WITH A CAT. Cat goes flying, bounces

off wall, lands on the coffee table, fangs bared.

So, if we didn't know already: CASS AND MILO ARE IN DIFFERENT

APARTMENTS.

INT CASS' APARTMENT/LIVING-ROOM- DAY

Stewart is trying to explain himself to a skeptical Milo:

Milo just waits.

Milo considers this.

INT JIMMY'S APARTMENT/LIVING-ROOM- DAY

Cass tries to coax the terrified cat out from under the sofa:

Suddenly the LANDLADY (as wide as she is tall) pops her head

in the door, startling Cass:

Oh. Whoops.

"Sex-change trouble"?

The landlady thinks this over.

ON CASS- Dammit.

INT CASS' APARTMENT/LIVING-ROOM- DAY

Milo explains, as he pokes around:

It is just dawning on Stewart:

Milo turns an angry red.

Milo tosses some papers around on her desk furiously.

He picks up the phone and checks the last dialed number: it

comes up "CAESAR'S CASINO". Milo smiles.

Milo erases the number, then heads for the door.

Milo exits. Stewart hurries to the phone and checks it, but

Milo erased the number. Shit. Stewart RACES to the window.

STEWART'S POV: MILO EXITING THE BUILDING, HEADED FOR HIS CAR.

INT JIMMY'S APARTMENT- DAY

Cass is about to give up when she spots, peeking out from the

bookshelf, A PLAIN ENVELOPE MARKED "CASSIDY DALEY". She slips

the envelope into her pocket just as the landlady appears:

EXT ATLANTIC CITY- DAY

The sun sparkles off the casino windows. It looks fun.

Exciting. A great place for the holidays.

SUDDENLY, THE WHOLE SCENE TURNS UPSIDE-DOWN, AND A MAN STARTS

TO SCREAM...

EXT TRUMP CASINO HOTEL ROOM- DAY

IT'S JIMMY, being dangled off a 25th floor balcony by Mahler,

who barely breaks a sweat.

Mahler lets go of one of Jimmy's feet. Now Jimmy is hanging

by one ankle. He starts to scream again.

INT CADILLAC/JERSEY CITY- DAY

Milo gets in, on the phone with Sid:

SPLIT-SCREEN:

Sid is at home, trying to get the hacked up Xmas tree to

stand up straight. His 5 and 6 year old sons beat on each

other in the background.

EXT CADILLAC- DAY

The cadillac pulls away from the curb.

RACK TO- A SKY-BLUE HYUNDAI, STEWART CROUCHED AT THE WHEEL.

Stewart pulls into traffic, FOLLOWING THE CADILLAC.

EXT HIGHWAY- AFTERNOON

The Cadillac on route to Atlantic City, the Hyundai not far

behind.

INT WAREHOUSE/ATLANTIC CITY- AFTERNOON

RAY (small, wiry, slightly demented-looking) reads from his

laptop while Lorraine paces behind him, swinging a golf club.

Ray nods and picks up the phone.

PUSH THOUGH THE WINDOW, ACROSS THE CITY, AND DOWN TO:

EXT CAESAR'S CASINO PARKING LOT- AFTERNOON

A HALF MILE AWAY AT CAESAR'S, Milo is pulling into the

crowded parking lot.

CHIRON: "1:00PM. ATLANTIC CITY. 44 HOURS TO GO."

Milo exits his car and heads inside. STEWART, feeling super

sly, pulls up to a space near Milo's car, but another car

slips into the spot.

EXT CAESAR'S CASINO DRESSING ROOM- AFTERNOON

Milo knocks on the door. A woman in heavy makeup (LOIS, Cass'

mother) opens the door, takes one look at Milo, SLAMS the

door shut. Milo waits. After a moment, Lois opens it again.

Lois bursts into tears and collapses into Milo's arms.

INT CAESAR'S CASINO DRESSING ROOM- MOMENTS LATER

Men running around in gowns and feather boas. A completely

recovered Lois sits by a make-up mirror, adjusting a wig.

Stuck to her mirror is a PHOTO OF MILO AND CASS, ARMS AROUND

EACH OTHER, SMILING. Milo gives the photo a dirty look.

She stands and wiggles into an evening gown. Milo struggles

with the zipper.

Milo's jaw hits the floor.

Now he really wants to take Cass to jail.

Milo thinks this over, then a grin breaks out on his face.

EXT CAESAR'S CASINO PARKING LOT- AFTERNOON

Stewart has finally found a parking space, and is exiting his

car when he sees Milo come out and jump into the Cadillac.

Stewart hurries back into his car.

EXT ATLANTIC CITY RACETRACK- AFTERNOON

Stands mobbed with people, horses galloping down the track,

dust rising in their wake. MOVING IN ON...

EXT STANDS- AFTERNOON

Surrounded by people cheering, CASS IS HARD AT WORK. Notebook

open, phone to ear, lap holding the plain envelope, ripped

open, contents exposed: A PIECE OF PAPER THAT SAYS: "ATLANTIC

CITY. XMAS EVE. SPARROW."

She has underlined "Sparrow" and made a list: "Person's name?

Company? Hotel? Casino?"

She clicks over to an incoming call, "PRIVATE CALLER":

SPLIT-SCREEN:

STEWART, at the mobbed track entrance, lost and frustrated:

Someone taps her shoulder. She glances up and sees: MILO,

SITTING RIGHT NEXT TO HER, GRINNING. She slowly closes her

phone, not bothering to say goodbye.

A MILLION DIFFERENT EMOTIONS CROSS CASS' FACE. Surprise,

anger, anxiousness. All the mixed emotions you have when you

suddenly run into THE MAN WHO BROKE YOUR HEART.

Strange, charged moment as they look at each other. Then they

have a casual contest:

Milo smirks.

Cass immediately stands.

She grabs her stuff. Milo blocks her with his leg.

Milo doesn't budge. Spelling it out for her:

Cass stares at him, eyes wide:

Milo moves his leg, kicks back, starts to count.

Cass stares at him, her jaw working, trying to decide what to

do. Then, all of a sudden, she BOLTS. Milo smiles. THE

LOUDSPEAKERS ANNOUNCE: "AND THEY'RE OFF!"

EXT RACETRACK PARKING LOT- AFTERNOON

Cass jumps into her car and turns the key. NOTHING. She tries

again, then hears soft laughter. MILO IS SEVERAL YARDS AWAY,

HER BATTERY IN HIS HAND.

Cass leaps from the car and runs.

INT STADIUM- AFTERNOON

Cass runs for the elevator. It opens and people exit,

REVEALING MILO:

Cass turns heel and bolts.

EXT STADIUM- AFTERNOON

Cass races out, flagging a taxi. Milo pulls up:

She heads for the cabs. Milo exits his car, GUN IN HAND.

Head whip around in his direction. THEN EVERY CAB IN THE

PLACE GOES OFF-DUTY. Cass stomps her foot, furious.

Cass marches back over to Milo.

With that, Milo sweeps her up into his arms. AND THEY FIND

THEMSELVES FACE TO FACE. BREATHING ON EACH OTHER. THEIR LIPS

INCHES APART.

Cass stares at Milo. Is he gonna kiss her? Again, she feels

weird. Confused.

Suddenly, MILO DUMPS HER IN THE TRUNK OF HIS CAR.

He smiles at her, waves, then SLAMS down the lid.

CUT TO BLACK. Well, now she knows exactly how she feels:

FURIOUS:

CHIRON: "2:00 PM. ROUTE 9 NORTH. 43 HOURS TO GO".

And immediately: A PHONE RINGS.

A match is struck, illuminating the trunk as Cass scrambles

for her phone. Trying to sound professional:

SPLIT-SCREEN:

CLOSE ON- JIMMY, head tilted back, tense smile on his face.

PULL BACK a little to reveal the GUN MAHLER IS HOLDING UNDER

HIS CHIN.

Mahler nudges Jimmy.

CLICK. MAHLER DISCONNECTS THE PHONE.

ON CASS- she stares at her phone. Uh-oh:

Suddenly, MUSIC KICKS IN and we hear MILO SINGING AT THE TOP

OF HIS LUNGS:

INT CADILLAC- AFTERNOON

Now Milo really is the happiest man alive. He pulls out his

cell phone, dials:

SPLIT-SCREEN:

Teresa removes her gum, sticks it on her mouse-pad, answers:

His phone beeps. IT'S CASS CALLING FROM THE TRUNK.

He clicks over.

SPLIT-SCREEN:

Cass rolls her eyes.

Cass turns bright red. She was drunk when they hooked up.

Changing tactics, she tries to flatter him:

Long beat. Suddenly, CASS STARTS TO SOB. LOUD, HYSTERICAL

SOBS. Milo listens for a moment, out of a purely clinical

interest, then:

Cass instantly stops crying and slams her phone shut.

CUT TO BLACK. Then, the sound of a trunk opening, and WE ARE

INSIDE A CAR TRUNK, LOOKING UP AT: MAHLER.

EXT TRUMP CASINO PARKING LOT- AFTERNOON

Mahler reaches into his trunk and REMOVES HIS HANDGUN. Checks

the cartridge, pockets the gun. Slams the trunk shut.

He climbs into his front seat, and as he pulls out of the

lot, we see CASS' NEWSPAPER PHOTO THAT HAS BEEN RIPPED FROM

THE PAPER, on the passenger seat.

INT CADILLAC- AFTERNOON

Milo drives along happily humming when, suddenly, A SMALL

TRAIL OF SMOKE drifts over his shoulder. What the hell...? He

glances into the rearview mirror and:

SMOKE IS POURING OUT OF THE TRUNK!

Still nothing. Milo jerks the car to the right, and SLAMS on

the brakes.

EXT CADILLAC- AFTERNOON

The car screeches to a halt on the embankment. Milo leaps out

of the driver's door and races to back, fumbling with his

keys. SMOKE CONTINUES TO POUR OUT OF THE TRUNK.

Gets the key in, pops the lid and sees: CASS, HANDKERCHIEF

OVER HER NOSE, PACK OF FLAMING MATCHES IN HAND. Cass tosses

the matches and handkerchief, AND PUNCHES MILO IN THE BALLS.

Milo groans and crumbles to the ground. Cass jumps out of the

trunk and stands over him:

BAM, Milo grabs her ankle and JERKS and Cass hits the ground.

Next thing you know, IT'S WWF TIME, THE TWO OF THEM ROLLING

IN THE DIRT.

Milo gets her pinned, but Cass grabs his ear and TWISTS:

He pulls her arm behind her back...

...and she jerks her head back, SMACKING him in the nose.

He gets her in a BEAR HUG...

...and she BITES him.

Finally, he has her on her back, TRAPPED. He gets his face

right over hers and STARTS TO LET A GLOB OF SALIVA FALL FROM

HIS MOUTH TOWARDS HER FACE.

Milo collapses onto the ground next to her, laughing. She

looks at him and she starts laughing too.

They both laugh harder. Then Milo stands and offers her a

hand. She takes it, and he helps her up. Awkward pause as

they look at each other.

He opens his arms. She moves closer. They hug. Milo feels her

hands moving towards the gun in his belt. He smirks. CLICK.

HE SNAPS SOME HANDCUFFS ONTO HER WRISTS.

INT CADILLAC- AFTERNOON

They are driving along, both a little dishevelled, ONE OF

CASS' HANDS CUFFED TO THE PASSENGER DOOR. They pass casinos

as they head out of Atlantic City.

Cass turns to inspect him more closely.

Milo has been sleeping on the floor.

Cass is skeptical:

Cass thinks this over, then counters:

About to deny that she and Stewart are a couple, it occurs to

Cass: Milo seems a little JEALOUS. She jumps on this:

He shoots her a sharp look. She stares back, waiting.

Ok. That is definitely a challenge.

Milo makes a SUDDEN TURN OFF THE HIGHWAY and pulls into the

parking lot of BALLY'S CASINO.

Again: famous last words. Milo exits the car. Cass smiles to

herself. This is obviously what she hoped would happen. She

glances around, spots THE DUFFLE in the back seat. PEEKING

OUT OF THE TOP OF THE DUFFLE IS THE TASER GUN. Hmm...

EXT CADILLAC- AFTERNOON

Milo opens her door.

He uncuffs her from the door, CUFFS HER TO HIS OWN WRIST.

EXT HIGHWAY- AFTERNOON

Stewart is heading back to the city, cursing his bad luck,

when he happens to glance over and see MILO AND CASS HEADING

INTO BALLY'S CASINO.

He makes a quick turn off the highway and into the Bally's

parking lot.

INT BALLY'S CASINO- AFTERNOON

The clerk at the chips cage recognizes Milo as he and Cass

APPROACH:

Behind the clerk, a FEMALE CLERK perks up at this name...

Milo glances at Cass.

While the clerk is counting out chips, WE NOTICE BEHIND HIM

THE FEMALE CLERK PICKING UP THE PHONE...

INT WAREHOUSE- LATE AFTERNOON

Lorraine on the phone, listening intently. Then she hangs up,

grinning.

RAY appears next to her.

Ray cracks his knuckles, smirks at Dwight, and exits.

INT BALLY'S BLACKJACK TABLE- LATE AFTERNOON

Milo sits at a blackjack table, pulling Cass into a seat next

to him.

He bets while Cass sits next to him, scheming:

She uses her free hand to pull out her wallet:

He takes the cash from her and thinks for a moment.

Milo adds her cash to his bet on the table.

The dealer deals the cards.

Milo quickly lays out some more money. A WAITRESS (smells

like an ashtray) appears:

The waitress looks back and forth between them.

The waitress rolls her eyes and leaves. Milo turns to see he

has lost more money.

Ok. Cass has had enough of this. She leans closer:

Milo perks up.

"Golly"? Cass stares at him, realizing:

Cass narrows her eyes:

Cass takes a deep breath. This is getting her nowhere. But

she is clearly hesitant to give him the real story.

Milo snorts.

Cass stares at him.

Milo breaks out into loud guffaws. Cass is furious.

Cass can't believe this.

Wow. That was pretty harsh. Cass looks at him, stunned. They

stare at each other in silence.

The waitress arrives with the drinks:

EXT BALLY'S CASINO PARKING LOT- LATE AFTERNOON

Stewart taps his steering wheel restlessly, watching the door

of the casino for signs of Cass and Milo. Waiting in this

parking lot is boring. Finally, he exits his car. Sidles over

to Milo's car. Checks the door handle.

IT'S UNLOCKED. Stewart glances around, then climbs in.

INT BALLY'S CASINO BATHROOM- LATE AFTERNOON

Cass enters and Milo follows:

Milo checks the room. Looks like there is no escape from

here. He UNCUFFS HER, but then:

Milo checks her pockets. Her ankles. Her legs. He goes behind

her and checks her shoulders. Her back. He reaches around and

checks her belly.

Milo reaches higher and:

Milo backs off, turning red.

He exits. As soon as he is gone, CASS PULLS MILO'S TASER GUN

FROM HER CLEAVAGE.

INT CADILLAC- LATE AFTERNOON

Stewart is rummaging around inside Milo's car when he looks

up and sees: RAY, standing there, smiling at him.

Suddenly, Ray GRABS STEWART'S HEAD AND SMASHES IT INTO THE

STEERING WHEEL, KNOCKING HIM OUT COLD.

EXT CASINO BATHROOM- LATE AFTERNOON

Milo checks his watch, then raps on the door.

INT CASINO BATHROOM- LATE AFTERNOON

Cass squints at the taser gun, trying to read the tiny

instruction label on the side:

He comes in and SHE JAMS THE TASER GUN INTO HIS NECK AND HITS

THE BUTTON. HE SCREAMS AND HITS THE FLOOR. SHE SCREAMS, DROPS

THE TASER GUN, AND FLEES.

EXT CASINO- LATE AFTERNOON

CASS RUNS OUT, BANGS INTO SOMEONE...

...and keeps going. She hurries to the curb and tries to flag

down a ride.

RACK TO- SEVERAL YARDS AWAY, THE PERSON SHE BUMPED INTO IS

STARING AFTER HER. IT'S MAHLER. Mahler compares her to the

newspaper photo he is holding. Yup: THAT'S HER.

Cass glances around, keeping an eye out for Milo, and SPOTS

MAHLER STARING AT HER. Suddenly, he starts heading towards

her. Cass backs up slightly, nervous. WHO IS THAT GUY?

Cass looks around. A trucker has pulled up next to her.

Relieved, she quickly climbs on board.

RACK TO- MAHLER, WATCHING THE TRUCK PULL AWAY. He doesn't

seem worried. He turns and heads for his car.

INT TRUCK- LATE AFTERNOON

Cass is fixing her hair, pulling herself together.

Cass looks at him. He smiles coyly.

The driver mouths something at her we can't see. Cass leans

over and SMACKS HIM AS HARD AS SHE CAN.

EXT HIGHWAY- LATE AFTERNOON

The truck SCREECHES to a halt by the side of the road. Cass

gets booted out the passenger door. The door is slammed shut

behind her. Cass gives the guy the finger as he drives off.

She turns to see a car headed her way. She starts flagging it

down. But wait... Yup, IT'S MILO. Shit. She looks around, but

where's she gonna go? Meanwhile, as Milo nears, HE SEEMS TO

BE SPEEDING UP. Cass stares. He keeps coming, an evil look on

his face. IT LOOKS LIKE HE IS GOING TO RUN HER OVER.

She turns and STARTS TO RUN.

INT CADILLAC- LATE AFTERNOON

Milo is laughing.

EXT FIELD- LATE AFTERNOON

Cass runs into a field. Milo drives off the road and follows.

He gets her cornered by a pen. He looks triumphant. She

scowls. Then she throws open the pen, REVEALING A HUGE BULL.

Now she looks triumphant. He scowls.

CUT TO- BULL RAMS INTO MILO'S CAR, SLAMMING MILO'S FACE INTO

THE STEERING WHEEL. CASS LAUGHS. THE BULL TURNS AND NOTICES

CASS FOR THE FIRST TIME.

CUT TO- BULL CHASES CASS. MILO LAUGHS. CASS RUNS FOR THE CAR.

MILO LOCKS THE DOORS.

THE BULL IS SPEEDING THEIR WAY:

Finally, Milo opens it. She DIVES INTO THE CAR AND SLAMS THE

DOOR just before the BULL RAMS INTO THE SIDE OF THE CAR.

Cass and Milo watch, stunned, as the bull looks at them for a

moment, THEN TOPPLES OVER, UNCONSCIOUS. Milo and Cass hear a

strange sound, and look over to see A SMALL HERD OF BULLS,

GETTING READY TO CHARGE.

MILO HITS THE GAS AND THEY FLEE THE SCENE, THE HERD OF BULLS

IN MAD PURSUIT. CASS AND MILO ARE BOTH NOW LAUGHING

HYSTERICALLY...

CHIRON: "5:00 PM. ROUTE 9 ADJACENT. 40 HOURS TO GO."

INT WAREHOUSE- EARLY EVENING

Lorraine waves Dwight over.

Ray THROWS open the bathroom door to reveal: A VERY

DISGRUNTLED STEWART, HANDCUFFED TO THE TOILET. Stewart blinks

up at them, disoriented.

Lorraine hands Dwight THE GOLF CLUB.

DWIGHT WHACKS STEWART IN THE SHIN WITH THE CLUB. STEWART

SCREAMS.

Lorraine and Ray stare at him.

They all look at Stewart, who moans in pain.

RAY AND DWIGHT EXIT.

Lorraine considers him for a moment, then SLAMS the bathroom

door in his face.

INT CADILLAC- EARLY EVENING

Milo and Cass are back on the highway, both looking a little

worse for wear. Milo's nose is swollen, Cass' clothes are

muddy.

Milo MOVES HIS WEAPONS FROM THE DUFFLE INTO HIS OWN JACKET

WHILE HE DRIVES. He smirks at Cass.

NOW HIS JACKET IS FULL OF WEAPONS. He turns his attention

back to the road. Cass studies his profile.

Milo surreptitiously sniffs himself.

Milo starts to laugh. Cass flushes:

Cass SEES A DARK CHEVY in the rearview mirror, gets a look at

the driver and goes pale.

Milo glances into the mirror, checking the guy out.

Cass kicks a leg over and SLAMS HER FOOT ONTO THE GAS. The

car LEAPS forward...

Milo tries to push her foot off the gas while they wrestle

for the wheel. THE CAR DOES A CRAZY ZIG-ZAG BACK AND FORTH...

She points past him. Milo turns to see MAHLER DRIVING BESIDE

THEM, GUN POINTED AT MILO'S HEAD.

They both duck as Mahler starts firing. GLASS SHATTERS ALL

AROUND THEM. MILO PULLS OUT HIS GUN and STARTS FIRING BACK...

EXT HIGHWAY- EARLY EVENING

BOTH CARS VEER WILDLY FROM LANE TO LANE AS MILO AND MAHLER

FIRE AT EACH OTHER...

CLOSE ON- THE CADILLAC'S REAR TIRE, AS IT GOES FLAT FROM A

BULLET...

INT CADILLAC- EARLY EVENING

MILO GRIPS THE WHEEL AS THE CAR STARTS TO DRAG AND LOSE

GROUND. Cass is hunched over in the passenger seat, excited

and frightened at the same time.

Mahler pulls alongside them again and Milo WRENCHES the wheel

to the left, SLAMMING THE CADILLAC INTO MAHLER'S CAR.

Mahler's car goes skidding across the road, hits a ditch and

FLIPS ONTO ITS SIDE.

EXT HIGHWAY- EARLY EVENING

The cadillac SPEEDS away, leaving Mahler's car behind.

EXT HIGHWAY- EARLY EVENING

The Cadillac is parked on the shoulder, Milo changing the

tire, Cass standing by the passenger door, still handcuffed,

EXCITED:

Cass whips her head around to look at him:

Milo rolls his eyes and straightens up.

Milo finishes with the tire, throws the jack in the back, and

heads back around to the driver's seat.

Cass watches him closely, getting an idea. She reaches into

her pocket and pulls out the paper from Jimmy.

Milo flinches, then forces a laugh.

Milo hesitates. Then decides: fuck it. He strides around the

car and SNATCHES the paper from her hand. He reads:

Milo stares at the paper, wracking his brain. Cass sighs

loudly and SNATCHES the paper back.

Cass stares him in the eye and says the magic words:

Milo stares at her. She stares back. Long beat. Milo's face

is red. He clenches his fists. He unclenches them. Fuck. He

thrusts out his hand:

They shake.

He starts to walk away.

INT CADILLAC- MOMENTS LATER

Cass sits in the passenger seat and watches in the rearview

mirror while Milo paces behind the car, on the phone.

EXT CADILLAC- EARLY EVENING

Milo is talking to Sid:

SPLIT-SCREEN:

INT MALL- EARLY EVENING

Sid's at the mall. On Dec 23rd. With all the other desperate,

last-minute shoppers. In other words, HE'S IN HELL.

Milo notices Cass watching him and turns his back slightly.

INT CADILLAC- EARLY EVENING

Cass narrows her eyes:

EXT CADILLAC- EARLY EVENING

Milo is making this up as he goes along:

Sid spots what he is looking for. So does another last-minute

shopper. They both reach for the toy.

Sid WRENCHES the toy from the other shopper.

Milo hangs up and gets in the car.

EXT CADILLAC- EARLY EVENING

The cadillac pulls a U-turn and HEADS BACK TOWARDS ATLANTIC

CITY.

CHIRON: "6:00 PM. ROUTE 9 SOUTH. 39 HOURS TO GO."

EXT HOTDOG STAND- EVENING

Milo buys a chili dog while talking to Cass who stands next

to him, handcuffed.

Milo stares.

Milo is staring at her.

She hands it to him. Milo checks the record of incoming calls

and smiles.

SPLIT-SCREEN:

EXT PADDY WAGON- EVENING

Bobby talks into his cell phone while supervising a parade of

hookers being loaded into a van:

EXT GARAGE- EVENING

A tow truck is pulling up, towing Mahler's car. The tow truck

driver turns to Mahler, who is in the passenger seat:

Mahler thinks this over, then SMACKS THE DRIVER ACROSS THE

FACE WITH THE BUTT OF HIS GUN. The driver crumples in his

seat.

Mahler leans across him, opens the driver's side door, and

BOOTS him out of the cab.

EXT HIGHWAY- EVENING

The tow truck is driving away from the garage.

INT CADILLAC- EVENING

Milo climbs back into the car, holding a piece of paper with

the words "Trump Casino, room 2504" on it. He grins at Cass.

Milo whips his head around:

EXT HIGHWAY- EVENING

The Trump Casino on the strip, coming into view...

EXT TRUMP CASINO- EVENING

Milo pulls into the crowded parking lot and checks the

cartridge of his gun. Beside him, Cass is bubbling over with

excited energy:

Milo exits the car.

But he is already headed for the casino entrance. He waves at

her and disappears inside.

INT TRUMP CASINO- EVENING

Milo glides through the casino, past the blinking lights of

the slot machines, headed for the elevators. A DRUNK GUY in a

Hawaiian shirt is coming towards him and HE AND MILO

COLLIDE...

The drunk guy continues past. Milo holds up THE ROOM CARD KEY

HE HAS JUST SWIPED FROM THE GUY:

INT TRUMP CASINO 25TH FLOOR- EVENING

The elevator dings and Milo exits. He turns a corner and

heads down the hall. Another elevator DINGS behind him.

Milo continues down the hall. Suddenly, he STOPS and looks

behind him. No one is there.

He turns another corner and FINDS 2504. There is a "DO NOT

DISTURB" sign on the door. HE GOES PAST IT AND TAPS LIGHTLY

ON 2505.

No answer. He glances down the hall and sees a slight

movement. SOMEONE IS WATCHING HIM. He moves away from the

door, continues down the hall, THEN SLIPS INTO THE ICE

MACHINE ROOM...

INT ICE MACHINE ROOM- CONTINUOUS

Milo hits the light switch off and waits just inside the

door. Someone steps in, and MILO GRABS THEM AND THROWS THEM

AGAINST THE WALL. The person SCREAMS. Milo slaps a hand

across the person's mouth and switches on the light. And

finds himself face to face with:

CASS.

He looks at the handcuff dangling from her wrist, STILL

ATTACHED TO THE CAR DOOR ARM REST.

Suddenly, Milo goes still. THERE IS A CREAKING SOUND as

someone creeps down the hall. Milo puts a finger to Cass'

lips.

Then he peeks out the door.

MILO'S POV- THE CLEANING CART BEING SLOWLY WHEELED DOWN THE

HALL BY THE MAID. The maid stops by a room and enters.

INT HALLWAY- EVENING

Milo passes the maid's cart, glancing at her ROOM RECORD

SHEET, then continues on to room 2505. He uses the CARD HE

SWIPED on the door. Of course, IT DOESN'T WORK.

The maid peeks out into the hall.

Cass looks pleadingly at the maid.

The maid checks her chart, then crosses the hall and USES HER

PASS KEY TO OPEN THE DOOR.

Milo and Cass go inside.

INT ROOM 2505- EVENING

Milo closes the door carefully behind them, then tiptoes

across the room to the connecting door, Cass close on his

heels. All is silent.

Milo tiptoes closer to the door. Cass pulls on his sleeve.

She reaches for his jacket, and Milo pulls away.

They are at the door. Milo puts a finger to his lips and

tries the doorknob: LOCKED. He is about to work the lock when

THEY HEAR SCREAMS COMING FROM THE LOCKED ROOM.

No time to do this quietly. MILO TAKES A STEP BACK, THEN

KICKS THE DOOR IN...

INT HALLWAY- EVENING

Halfway down the hallway, THE MAID HEARS THE DOOR BEING

KICKED IN. Nervous, she backs away, headed for the

elevators...

INT ROOM 2504- CONTINUOUS

Milo QUICKLY ENTERS THE ROOM, GUN RAISED. THE SCREAMING IS

COMING FROM THE TV. Milo clicks it off and checks the room.

The place appears to be deserted. He crosses to the bathroom

and peers in: EMPTY.

Meanwhile, Cass has cautiously entered the room and sees

spots on the rug:

Oooh. Cass grits her teeth.

She moves back to the door. As she does, she notices a

matchbook on the floor: IT'S A GREEN MATCHBOOK WITH A BLACK

SILHOUETTE OF A HORSE.

As he turns away, SHE SLIPS THE MATCHBOOK INTO HER PURSE.

Milo catches this movement out of the corner of his eye and

glances back:

Milo takes a step closer to her, but:

Cass and Milo turn to see A HOTEL SECURITY GUARD IN THE

DOORWAY, EXCITEDLY POINTING HIS GUN AT THEM. Milo rolls his

eyes.

Milo holds up HIS GUN.

Milo drops the cartridge, then TOSSES THE GUN RIGHT AT THE

GUARD'S FACE.

The guard instinctively raises his hands and Milo CHARGES

him, tackling him to the ground, then handcuffing him to the

table.

Milo GRABS Cass hand and races from the room.

INT HALLWAY- EVENING

Cass and Milo run up to the elevators. ALL CARS ARE RISING:

BACK-UP IS ON THE WAY. Milo hits the fire alarm and pulls

Cass into the stairwell...

INT STAIRWELL- EVENING

Milo and Cass are almost to the bottom, WHEN SECURITY APPEARS

IN THE STAIRWELL BENEATH THEM. Milo looks up. SECURITY IS

COMING FROM ABOVE, AS WELL. Shit. Milo cracks the stairwell

window and peers out: THEY ARE 4 STORIES UP.

Milo considers this, then picks her up and TOSSES HER OUT THE

WINDOW.

EXT TRUMP CASINO- EVENING

Cass screams as she falls. Milo falls next to her. They fall

and fall and BOOSH: THEY LAND IN A SNOW BANK AND TUMBLE TO

THE GROUND.

Seconds later, they are on their feet, RUNNING FOR THE CAR.

INT CADILLAC- EVENING

Milo and Cass are speeding away from the Trump Casino.

SPLIT-SCREEN:

INT POLICE STATION- EVENING

Bobby is in his office. His door opens onto the squad room,

busy with police activity. Bobby sits up straighter in his

chair.

Beat.

Bobby thinks this over.

Milo checks his watch.

EXT BACK OF TRUMP CASINO- EVENING

The scene has calmed down a little. A DARK SEDAN appears and

RAY AND DWIGHT exit the car, looking like a an ugly,

dangerous Odd Couple.

An employee slips out the back door and hands Ray a PHOTO

FROM SECURITY OF MILO AND CASS IN THE CASINO PARKING LOT.

Dwight snatches the photo from Ray.

It's true. They aren't too far. They are:

EXT OFF ROUTE 9- EVENING

A LUXURIOUS, ROMANTIC B&B. Xmas lights winking on the trees,

"Come All Ye Faithful" gently wafting out the oak front door.

CHIRON: "9:00 PM. ROUTE 9 SOUTH. 36 HOURS TO GO."

The whole scene looks beautiful, peaceful, romantic...

PULL BACK TO REVEAL MILO AND CASS, parked in front. REVEAL

THE SIGN NEXT TO THEM: "WELCOME TO CUPID'S CABIN". Yup. The

place Milo and Cass ran off to and got married 3 years ago.

INT LUXURY B&B- EVENING

A small, family-run, luxury bed and breakfast. The kind of

place that prides itself on its service. DAWN (long, graying

hair, glasses, moccasins) greets them with a smile:

She looks behind her at a bulletin board. At photos of all

the happy couples who have passed through her. And finds: A

PHOTO OF MILO AND CASS, ARMS AROUND EACH OTHER, DRINKING

CHAMPAGNE, CASS SHOWING OFF AN ENGAGEMENT RING.

A balding man in flannel comes out, takes one look, and

clasps both hands to his chest.

Milo and Cass both try to downplay:

Before Cass can protest more, MILO GRABS HER ARM.

He pulls her slightly aside.

They give each other a horrified look as they both realize

what this means. Then they turn back to the couple, put their

arms around each other, and smile:

Milo and Cass snuggle closer. He surreptitiously squeezes her

ass. She surreptitiously STOMPS on his foot.

INT LUXURY B&B DINING-ROOM- EVENING

Full of couples in love. Young couples, old couples, gay

couples, straight couples. Even a dog couple snuggled up by

the fire.

And then there's Milo and Cass, bruised and dishevelled,

being served an elaborate romantic meal. They smile

uncomfortably as Edmund arrives with a tray of oysters:

He gives them both a broad wink.

He beams at Cass. Cass grins through her teeth.

Just then, Dawn hustles over, interrupting:

She raises a glass, tapping it with a spoon. Milo and Cass

both groan under their breath.

The whole restaurant starts clapping. Milo turns to Edmund:

INT LUXURY B&B HALLWAY- NIGHT

Milo and Cass stumble down the hall, laughing hysterically,

falling down drunk.

This one is obviously true. Both laugh harder.

INT LUXURY B&B HONEYMOON SUITE- NIGHT

Milo and Cass stagger in, blinking hazily at their new

surroundings. A heart-shaped bed. Champagne. A bubble bath. A

fireplace. The works. Like Cupid threw up in here.

The laughter slowly fades. Long beat. Then:

Which reminds them: THEY DON'T TRUST EACH OTHER. Awkward

pause. Then:

Cass disappears into the bathroom, closing the door behind

her. Beat. Then MILO HURRIES OVER TO THE DOOR AND LISTENS.

INT LUXURY B&B BATHROOM- NIGHT

CASS IS PRESSED ON HER SIDE OF THE DOOR, ALSO LISTENING. She

reaches over and turns on the shower.

INT LUXURY B&B HONEYMOON SUITE- NIGHT

As soon as Milo hears the water, HE HURRIES OVER TO THE BED

WHERE CASS LEFT HER PURSE. HE STARTS DIGGING THROUGH IT.

MEANWHILE:

INT LUXURY B&B BATHROOM- NIGHT

Cass is seated on the toilet lid, HUNCHED OVER HER PHONE:

SPLIT-SCREEN

Mom is at a gay bar, having a cocktail.

Long beat.

INT LUXURY B&B HONEYMOON SUITE- NIGHT

Milo is looking through Cass' purse. HE KNOWS SHE WAS HIDING

SOMETHING FROM HIM AT THE CASINO. While searching through her

wallet, he suddenly stumbles across A WEDDING PHOTO OF

HIMSELF AND CASS.

Huh. He glances at the bathroom door. She carries their

wedding photo around?

INT LUXURY B&B BATHROOM- NIGHT

Cass listens while Mom rants:

Cass hangs up. She sits for a moment, staring at her phone.

Is her mother right? Is she making a mistake right now? She

looks around the bathroom. Candles, flowers, thick robes.

A bottle of champagne chilling by the heart-shaped tub. She

slowly stands and checks herself out in the mirror, brushing

back her hair with her hands.

Suddenly, on impulse, she grabs the bottle of champagne and

two glasses. WHAT THE HELL, WHY NOT?

They're here, maybe they should seize the moment. She peeks

out the bathroom door and sees...

INT LUXURY B&B SUITE- NIGHT

MILO, DIGGING THROUGH HER PURSE, FINDING THE MATCHES...

INT BATHROOM- NIGHT

Cass is disappointed and vindicated all at once. She puts the

champagne back.

INT LUXURY B&B SUITE- NIGHT

Milo hears the water go off. HE POCKETS THE MATCHES, tosses

the purse away and lies on the bed, striking a casual pose.

Cass emerges.

He holds up the handcuffs:

MUSIC KICKS IN: "Silent Night".

INT LUXURY B&B SUITE- NIGHT

SNOW IS FALLING OUTSIDE. PAN FROM THE WINDOW, ACROSS THE ROOM

TO THE BED, ACROSS A SNORING MILO TO CASS, EYES CLOSED, HAND

CUFFED TO THE HEADBOARD.

Suddenly, CASS' EYES SNAP OPEN. She sits up a little and

glances over at MILO'S NIGHT TABLE WHERE HE LEFT THE KEYS AND

GUN IN PLAIN VIEW. She smiles...

INT LUXURY B&B SUITE- TEN MINUTES LATER

Cass is doing a slow, careful, ACROBATIC CLIMB ACROSS MILO'S

BODY in an attempt to reach the gun without waking Milo up.

She puts a hand on the headboard. She is lifting her knee

over him, when he stirs.

She freezes, waiting for him to settle. It's like playing

Twister, only if the person you're playing with finds out,

HE'S GOING TO KILL YOU.

She manages to get herself STRADDLING HIM, arms stretched,

THE GUN ALMOST WITHIN REACH, when:

Cass FREEZES.

She looks down. Milo is watching her, wide awake. Hmm. This

is going to be a tough one to explain.

She tries to reach for the gun while they talk.

Her hand is groping around blindly, where the fuck is it? She

stretches more, bringing her face even closer to Milo's.

Uh-oh.

The gun seems to be getting father away. THEIR LIPS ARE

ALMOST TOUCHING NOW...

Cass blushes fiercely. If she didn't want that gun so bad...

He reaches down and WHIPS OUT:

THE GUN IS IN HIS HAND. That's why she couldn't reach it. HE

KNEW WHAT SHE WAS UP TO THIS WHOLE TIME. She flips off him

and back onto her side. Milo sits up, flipping on the lights.

He rolls over, turning his back to her. Cass stares at the

ceiling, fuming.

EXT CHARLEY'S- DAWN

A strip club on the boardwalk. MOVING IN ON THE BACK DOOR...

INT CHARLEY'S STORAGE ROOM- NIGHT

Jimmy, tied to a chair, watches nervously as MAHLER TAKES

EVIDENCE BOXES THAT ARE STACKED ALONG THE WALLS AND MOVES

THEM ONTO A MOVER'S DOLLY.

Mahler has all the boxes loaded up. He grabs a rag and

approaches Jimmy.

Mahler gags him, THEN PUNCHES HIM IN THE FACE. JIMMY SLUMPS

OVER.

Mahler grabs the dolly, flicks off the lights, and EXITS OUT

THE BACK DOOR.

INT LUXURY B&B DINING ROOM- DAY

CHIRON: "2:00PM. ROUTE 9 NORTH. 19 HOURS TO GO."

Cass is in a booth, handcuffed, her mouth set, her face grim.

No more Mr Nice Guy. She is scheming her way out.

RACK TO MILO, SEVERAL PACES AWAY, ON THE PHONE WITH TERESA,

keeping one eye on Cass:

SPLIT-SCREEN:

Teresa at her desk, sipping eggnog.

Sid passes through, kids in tow, and carrying A HUGE, TANGLED

BALL OF XMAS LIGHTS. Sid looks like he wants to put a bullet

through his brain.

Teresa mouths "Milo". Sid picks up the other extension.

CLICK. Sid hangs up. Milo turns to see Cass CONFERRING WITH

DAWN.

INT BOOTH- LATE MORNING

Milo joins Cass. Re: Dawn:

Milo glances at Dawn and she nods in confirmation.

Milo takes a bite from his burger and considers Cass.

Suddenly, MILO GETS A FUNNY LOOK ON HIS FACE.

MILO'S FACE IS TURNING BRIGHT RED. HE GASPS FOR AIR. HE

SLOWLY SLIDES OFF HIS CHAIR ONTO THE FLOOR. Cass calmly

reaches across the table, taking his keys and unhandcuffing

herself.

Car keys in hand, she bends down to whisper in his ear:

...and heads for the door.

INT CADILLAC- DAY

Cass drives along, on the phone with 411:

INT LUXURY B&B PARKING LOT- DAY

Next to an ambulance, Milo is unconscious on a stretcher. An

EMT prepares a HUGE SYRINGE, picks a spot on Milo's chest,

then PLUNGES THE NEEDLE INTO IT.

Milo JERKS up on a gurney, gasping for air.

The EMT exchanges a look with the ambulance driver, then

helps Milo off the stretcher.

He checks his watch, then pulls out the GREEN MATCHBOOK:

The EMT folds the stretcher, loads it into the ambulance, and

THEY DRIVE AWAY, leaving Milo in the parking lot.

Milo starts trying handles of parked cars until he finds one

that's open and SLIPS INSIDE.

EXT ATLANTIC CITY BOARDWALK- AFTERNOON

Cass pulls up, parks in a lot, and instantly spots CHARLEY'S

GREEN SIGN WITH THE BLACK HORSE SILHOUETTE, squeezed between

a burger place and a souvenir shop. She slips out of the car,

takes a careful look around, then works her way towards the

club.

INT CHARLEY'S- AFTERNOON

POV OF THE FRONT DOOR, OPENING A CRACK, CASS PEEKING IN.

CASS' POV- WOMEN DANCING, MEN DRINKING. Seedy and cheesy at

the same time. Cass thinks this over, then slowly lets the

door swing closed.

EXT BACK OF CHARLEY'S- AFTERNOON

Cass finds the back entrance. THE DOOR IS BOLTED. She is

looking for a window to climb into, when she spots JIMMY'S

METS' HAT ON THE GROUND.

Shit. Cass stares at the hat: JIMMY IS HERE SOMEWHERE. She

presses her ear up against the back door:

Suddenly, SHE HEARS GROANING COMING FROM INSIDE. Or grunting.

LIKE SOMEONE TRYING TO CALL OUT THROUGH A GAG. She looks

around. There is a window higher up on the wall. Cass drags a

trash can beneath the window, stacks another one on top of

it, and cautiously climbs up.

The window is locked and she can't see through it. Hmm. Fuck

it. She takes her purse and SMASHES a pane of glass.

She wobbles on trash cans and GRABS THE WINDOWSILL JUST AS

THE CANS FALL AWAY, LEAVING HER DANGLING.

INT CHARLEY'S STORAGE ROOM- AFTERNOON

Jimmy is staring nervously up at the broken window. He can

see hands and can hear someone cursing under their breath.

The top of a head appears, then a face: IT'S CASS.

Relieved, Jimmy starts gesturing excitedly for her to come

in. Cass climbs in, drops to the floor, hurries over to Jimmy

and ungags him.

EXT BACK OF CHARLEY'S- MOMENTS LATER

Cass peeks out the door, then gestures for Jimmy to follow.

EXT ATLANTIC CITY BOARDWALK- AFTERNOON

Cass and Jimmy are hurrying to the Cadillac...

INT CADILLAC- AFTERNOON

Cass and Jimmy climb in...

...but before Jimmy can answer:

Cass looks in the rearview mirror. SHIT: DWIGHT AND RAY ARE

IN THE BACKSEAT, POINTING GUNS AT THE BACK OF THEIR HEADS.

Jimmy almost bursts into tears.

Jimmy glances back at them. Do they mean he can just...?

Jimmy gives Cass a quick look ("sorry"), then exits the car

and TAKES OFF RUNNING DOWN THE BOARDWALK. CASS CAN'T BELIEVE

IT. She drops her forehead into the steering wheel in

despair.

EXT HIGHWAY- AFTERNOON

Milo is driving along in a stolen Volvo, cables hanging under

the steering wheel from where he hot-wired it. He is just

coming up on the boardwalk when his phone rings.

INT CHARLEY'S- AFTERNOON

Cass is seated in a booth with Dwight and Ray. Into phone:

Ray grabs the phone away from her. Into phone:

CLICK. Ray stares at the phone. In disbelief:

EXT ATLANTIC CITY BOARDWALK- AFTERNOON

Milo is pulling up. Sees Charley's. Then SEES HIS OWN CAR. He

glances around: CASS MUST BE AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE.

His phone rings again.

SPLIT-SCREEN:

Dwight tries to explain:

Milo hears MUSIC COMING FROM DWIGHT'S END. DANCE MUSIC.

SLEAZY MUSIC. UNMISTAKABLY STRIP-CLUB MUSIC.

He heads for CHARLEY'S. Into phone:

Cass grabs the phone from Dwight. Into phone:

INT CHARLEY'S- CONTINUOUS

Milo slips inside and scans the room. HE SEES CASS IN A BOOTH

ACROSS THE ROOM WITH DWIGHT AND RAY. Into phone:

Cass hesitates. Into phone:

Beat.

Long pause.

Cass sits up straighter. Wait a second, he's here?

CLICK. He hangs up.

CLOSE ON- THE BOOTH.

INT BATHROOM- MOMENTS LATER

Cass enters. Milo is behind the door. He SLAMS the door

closed after she is in, and blocks her escape.

Cass is not impressed. She stares at him coldly.

Milo stares at her. Huh. It actually didn't occur to him...

"About to happen"? Milo is just starting to realize...

Son of a bitch. The bathroom door SHOOTS open and DWIGHT AND

RAY ENTER. They back Milo into a corner. Cass smiles at Milo,

waves, and exits.

EXT CHARLEY'S- AFTERNOON

Cass comes flying out of the club and runs right into:

MAHLER. HE TAKES ONE LOOKS AT HER AND PUSHES HER BACK INSIDE.

INT BATHROOM- AFTERNOON

Dwight and Ray are frisking Milo, taking away his array of

weapons.

INT CHARLEY'S- CONTINUOUS

Milo is pushed out of the bathroom, and comes face to face

with CASS. MAHLER APPEARS FROM BEHIND HER, TAKES ONE LOOK AT

MILO AND POINTS HIS GUN AT MILO'S HEAD.

Dwight steps forward from behind Milo, AND POINTS HIS GUN AT

MAHLER. MAHLER REACTS, SHIFTING THE GUN TO DWIGHT. RAY STEPS

UP, GUN POINTED AT MAHLER.

Momentary stand-off. Stuck between the bad guys, MILO AND

CASS GIVE EACH OTHER EVIL LOOKS.

A half-naked dancer appears:

Everyone looks at her. She is just realizing...

...WHEN MILO AND CASS SIMULTANEOUSLY MAKE THEIR MOVES, CASS

STOMPING ON MAHLER'S FOOT, CAUSING HIM TO LOOSEN HIS HOLD ON

HER, MILO SLAMMING HIS ELBOW BACK ONTO RAY'S ABDOMEN.

RAY'S GUN GOES OFF AS CASS AND MILO BOTH HIT THE FLOOR.

MAHLER REACTS, FIRING AT RAY. DWIGHT FIRES AT MAHLER...

TOTAL PANDEMONIUM. Girls screaming, patrons running for the

exit.

MAHLER AND DWIGHT BOTH GET HIT. Milo crawls over to a moaning

Dwight and recovers his gun. He looks up in time to see CASS

DISAPPEARING OUT THE FRONT DOOR.

EXT BOARDWALK- AFTERNOON

Milo comes out. THE BOARDWALK IS PACKED, CASS IS LOST IN THE

CROWD. Milo raises his gun in the air and FIRES. People duck

and scatter REVEALING CASS, climbing into the Cadillac.

SIRENS...

INT CADILLAC- AFTERNOON

Cass jumps into the car and hits the gas. She is pulling

away, victorious, WHEN THERE IS A SOUND ON THE ROOF.

MILO'S FACE APPEARS, UPSIDE-DOWN, IN THE WINDSHIELD,

GRINNING.

He gives her the finger.

He reaches a hand through the driver's window, grabbing at

her. Cass SCREAMS, squeezes her eyes shut and HITS THE GAS.

MORE SIRENS, RAPIDLY APPROACHING...

EXT HIGHWAY- AFTERNOON

THE CAR IS WEAVING CRAZILY, MILO SLIDING BACK AND FORTH

ACROSS THE ROOF...

INT CADILLAC- AFTERNOON

Cass opens her eyes. MILO IS HALFWAY IN THE PASSENGER WINDOW.

Milo falls into the car, grabbing at the wheel. They fight

for control of the car as it goes spinning off the road...

EXT TREES- AFTERNOON

The Cadillac skids wildly, COMPLETELY OUT OF CONTROL...

INT CADILLAC- AFTERNOON

THEY WRESTLE FOR CONTROL...

INT CADILLAC- AFTERNOON

TO SLAM ON THE BRAKES AND THE CAR SKIDS TO A HALT JUST INCHES

FROM A CLIFF.

Silence.

EXT BOARDWALK- EARLY EVENING

Cops everywhere, Dwight and Ray leaning over the hood of a

squad car, being handcuffed, MAHLER UNCONSCIOUS ON A

STRETCHER.

A BYSTANDER IS TALKING TO A COP, DESCRIBING:

INT CADILLAC- EARLY EVENING

CHIRON: "6:00 PM. ABOVE THE ATLANTIC OCEAN. 13 HOURS TO GO".

Cass and Milo both just sit there breathing for a moment.

Then Milo turns and glares at Cass, and THE LOOK ON HER FACE

SAYS SHE KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT'S COMING NEXT:

EXT TRUNK- EARLY EVENING

CASS IS BACK IN THE TRUNK. Milo waves goodbye and SLAMS shut

the lid.

IMMEDIATELY, HIS CELL PHONE RINGS. Milo glances at it, then

reluctantly answers:

SPLIT-SCREEN:

Bobby, ocean in the background, furious:

Milo looks around. He can just make out Pier 19 in the

distance, a mile or two away.

EXT PIER 19- EVENING

Milo and Cass drive up in the Cadillac and park out of sight.

They exit the car and look around. The pier seems to be

deserted. Then they hear a soft motor, and BOBBY APPEARS IN A

MOTORBOAT.

EXT OCEAN- EARLY EVENING

The sound of a motorboat chugging along.

INT MOTORBOAT- EVENING

Bobby is at the back of the boat, steering. Cass and Milo are

up front, explaining:

A SMALL YACHT APPEARS ON THE HORIZON. Bobby steers the

motorboat towards it. MILO AND CASS TURN TO LOOK AS THE YACHT

COMES INTO VIEW. AND AT THE SAME MOMENT, CASS AND MILO MAKE

OUT THE NAME ON THE SIDE OF THE BOAT:

"SPARROW".

Cass and Milo both slowly turn to find BOBBY POINTING A GUN

AT THE TWO OF THEM. Off Milo's disappointed look:

Bobby quickly frisks Cass, and frisks and disarms Milo. He

steers the boat one-handed up next to the yacht and cuts the

motorboats engine.

Milo makes a sudden LUNGE for Bobby and BOBBY CRACKS HIM OVER

THE BACK OF THE HEAD WITH THE BUTT OF THE GUN, SENDING MILO

SPRAWLING TO THE BACK OF THE BOAT, RIGHT ON TOP OF THE MOTOR.

Milo struggles back up to a seated position.

INT HULL OF YACHT- EVENING

CHIRON: "11:00 PM. ATLANTIC OCEAN. 10 HOURS TO GO".

PAN PAST PILES OF EVIDENCE BOXES FULL OF EVERYTHING

IMAGINABLE: GUNS, VIDEOTAPES, DRUGS, ETC...

PAN PAST A PILE OF EXPLOSIVES WRAPPED WITH CABLE AND ATTACHED

TO A TIMER, COUNTING DOWN: "1:59, 1:58, 1:57..."

PAN TO MILO AND CASS SEATED ON THE FLOOR, TIED TOGETHER, BACK

TO BACK, ARMS STRAPPED TO THEIR SIDES.

PAN TO THE DOORWAY, where Bobby stands, inspecting the room.

Bobby exits and Cass and Milo are alone.

Suddenly, CASS STARTS GIGGLING.

Cass is laughing harder and harder until MILO REALIZES:

Milo doesn't know what to do. His hands are trapped in front

of him, he can't even pat her on the shoulder.

Milo looks around. There is a SMALL PORTHOLE IN ONE WALL.

Milo assumes a take-charge manner:

Beat.

CLOSE ON- THE TIMER: "1:19, 1:18, 1:17..."

Milo leans one way, Cass leans the other: THEY DON'T MOVE.

They both lean to the left and topple over. Milo is facing

the direction of the bomb.

They start moving like a sideways inchworm, creeping along.

Beat.

Milo seems surprised to hear this. But before he can respond,

THE BOAT ROCKS ON A WAVE AND THEY ARE SENT ROLLING IN CASS'

DIRECTION. AS THEY ROLL:

They are stopped when MILO'S FACE IS SLAMMED INTO THE SIDE OF

THE BOAT. Milo lets out a grunt. Beat.

They both start turning separate ways:

They turn to the right and wait. After a moment:

No response. Behind her back, Milo looks sheepish. Cass

REALIZES:

Milo looks confused. He is trying to figure out...

Aaah.

Beat. Milo clears his throat.

Suddenly, A WAVE HITS THE BOAT, AND THEY GO ROLLING TOWARDS

THE BOMB. AS THEY ROLL:

And they come to a stop, MILO'S FACE PRESSED RIGHT UP TO THE

BOMB. He watches the timer: "00:44, 00:43, 00:42..."

MILO GRABS THE BOMB AND HOLDS IT AGAINST HIS BELLY. Cass and

Milo push against each other, and struggle up to a standing

position.

Great. So far, so good.

Only, MILO CAN'T RAISE HIS ARMS. AND THE PORTHOLE IS SIX FEET

ABOVE THE GROUND. NOW WHAT?

Beat.

EXT PORTHOLE- EVENING

We see MILO'S HEAD POP INTO VIEW, THEN DISAPPEAR.

CLOSE ON- THE TIMER "00:11, 00:10, 00:09..."

MILO'S HEAD POPS UP HIGHER...

CLOSE ON- THE TIMER "00:06, 00:05, 00:04..."

This time, MILO POPS UP HIGH ENOUGH THAT WE SEE HIS HANDS...

CLOSE ON- THE TIMER "00:03, 00:02, 00:01..."

And finally, MILO IS HIGH ENOUGH THAT HE CAN THRUST THE BOMB

OUT THE WINDOW...

CLOSE ON THE BOMB AS IT CRASHES INTO THE WATER...

INT HULL OF BOAT- EVENING

Milo and Cass, both a little out of breath, stand still,

listening. Silence.

SUDDENLY, A LOW ROAR FROM BENEATH GROWS AND RISES UP BENEATH

THE BOAT, ROCKING IT WILDLY AS WATER EXPLODES ON ALL SIDES.

Cass and Milo get drenched, BUT ARE SAFE.

Because at this very moment...

INT MOTORBOAT- NIGHT

...Bobby is paddling frantically, pausing every once in a

while to curse the motor, WHICH FOR SOME REASON REFUSES TO

START. He see the lights of another boat coming up behind

him, and he paddles faster.

EXT DECK OF YACHT- NIGHT

Milo steers the yacht right up behind Bobby, dwarfing the

motorboat. Calling out:

Bobby looks up to see MILO POINTING AN ASSAULT RIFLE HE

GRABBED FROM THE EVIDENCE BOXES:

Bobby checks the motor: SO THAT'S WHY IT WON'T RUN. MILO

GRABBED THE SPARK PLUG. Milo and Cass grin down at Bobby

while he kicks the motor and swears.

EXT PIER 19- DAWN

CHIRON: "6:00 AM. PIER 19. 3 HOURS TO GO."

Cops are everywhere. Cass and Milo are seated on a bench,

exhausted, watching as THE COPS UNLOAD BOXES OF STOLEN

EVIDENCE FROM THE YACHT. Bobby is cuffed in the back of a

squad car.

After a moment:

Milo hands Cass some seaweed.

Milo checks his watch.

Cass' eyes go wide. Suddenly, she JUMPS UP and BOLTS.

EXT BEACH- DAWN

Like an action sequence in slo-mo, Cass stumbles across the

sand, exhausted, Milo at her heels. Finally, he makes one

last effort, LUNGES for her, brings her down and SNAPS on the

cuffs.

He pulls her to her feet.

INT JERSEY CITY POLICE STATION- MORNING

Milo leads Cass up to the clerk, both of them looking like a

mess. He checks his watch:

To shut her up, Milo GRABS HER AND KISSES HER. THEN SHE IS

KISSING HIM BACK. TIME STOPS FOR A MOMENT.

Then Milo hands her over to the clerk.

The clerk leads her into the jail.

EXT POLICE STATION- MORNING

Milo exits. He passes some cops on their way in. ONE GELMAN,

THE COP HE INSULTED IN THE BEGINNING.

Milo stops in his tracks. Mentally weighs the pros and cons.

DECIDES:

He turns around, walks back to Gelman, AND SMASHES HIM IN THE

FACE WITH HIS FIST.

INT HOLDING CELL- MORNING

Cass is trying to find a clean place to sit down, when MILO

GETS THROWN INTO THE HOLDING CELL NEXT TO HERS.

Cass grins. WEDDING MUSIC KICKS IN:

INT WEDDING CHAPEL- DAY

Sid and Lois are watching as MILO AND CASS GET REMARRIED.

CLOSE ON- MILO AND CASS, WHISPERING TO EACH OTHER UNDER THE

PRIEST'S BLESSING:

Cass smiles. Beat. Then:

BLACKOUT
