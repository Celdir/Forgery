FADE IN:

CLOSE ON A MASSIVE STEEL HEAD

Our first thought: DR. DOOM?  But it's not moving.  A

welder's torch sparks into frame in the hands of a sculptor

on scaffolding.  This is art, an epic 20 foot statue going up

of a business mogul (VICTOR VON DOOM) in whose generously

extended hands sit two intertwined columns of DNA.  His face

is chiseled, angular, perfect (too perfect).  Past sparks, we

MOVE down to pick up...

EXT. STREET/VON DOOM INDUSTRIES TOWER - DAY

REED RICHARDS and BEN GRIMM head toward the soaring glass-box

atrium of VDI Headquarters.  Designed to inspire awe, it

does.

Ben glances at Reed, who looks a little nervous.

INT. VON DOOM INDUSTRIES TOWER - DAY

They move past the statue, into the sprawling atrium.

He motions to a high-tech ORB, showing FOOTAGE of VDI's

accomplishments: a safe and clean nuclear facility, the first

private Space Station.

All images have VICTOR front and center, glad-handling George

Bush, Tony Blair, shady International Leaders.  The last

image is Victor holding the AMERICA'S CUP.

They reach three stern RECEPTIONISTS.

A receptionist cuts him off, handing them each a pass.

They head for the elevator.  Reed carries a small, black box.

As they enter the elevator, steel doors shut and we CUT TO --

INT. VON DOOM INDUSTRIES TOWER - OFFICE - DAY

A large, dark office.  Ben in the corner.  He yawns,

watches...

BRIGHT HOLOGRAMS: Stars.  Planets.  They hover in the air,

making the room feel like a majestic portal into outer space.

REED stands among the holograms, speaking to a MYSTERIOUS

FIGURE in shadow behind a desk.  An ominous, PULSATING RED

CLOUD covers the stars.  It washes over a hologram of EARTH.

The SHADOW clears his throat.  Reed speeds up, emotional.

The figure's DEEP VOICE pierces the darkness.

Lights brighten, revealing the face behind the voice: VICTOR

VON DOOM.  35, handsome, commanding.  He looks almost...

airbrushed.  He drops a WIRED magazine to the desk.  REED is

on the cover over the words: RICHARDS BANKRUPT, GRANT

CUTBACKS.

Reed presses the remote.  Another hologram appears: A SHUTTLE

slowly approaching AN ORBITING SPACE STATION.  Both bear the

VON DOOM INDUSTRIES logo.  Victor smiles, more intrigued.

Victor is a step ahead.  Reed pauses, thrown for a beat.  Ben

wakes up, suspicious.  Victor notices.  He notices

everything.

Ben gets close to Reed, turning toward the door.

A beat.  Victor cracks a smile, enjoying the tension.  And...

They turn to see...SUE STORM (demure, stunning) standing in a

corner...possibly for the whole presentation.  A little cold:

Sue gracefully walks into the office, only taking her eyes

off of Reed to give Ben a warm hug.

She gives Reed a polite handshake.  Victor watches carefully.

Reed looks uncomfortable in her gaze.  A little tongue-tied.

Victor sizes them up.  He puts a hand on Sue's shoulder.

Victor smiles, eyeing Sue.

Ben tightens.  A hard beat.  Reed sucks it up.

Sue gives a thin smile -- a flicker of old feelings.

They look at Victor.  How does he know all this...?

Reed looks at Ben, who shakes his head softly no.  But

Reed...drops a nod.  Done.  Victor smiles, offers a

handshake.

Victor squeezes.  Hard.  His other hand on Sue's shoulder.

As Reed and Sue lock eyes, Ben watches Victor.  Wary.

INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

Director of Communications LEONARD enters, checking files.

INT. VON DOOM INDUSTRIES TOWER - ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER

Reed and Ben step into the elevator.

Reed follows Ben's eyes to...SUE.  She joins them.  Doors

shut.

INT. VON DOOM INDUSTRIES STAIRCASE - CONTINUOUS

He nods, head down.  He doesn't want eye contact.

Sue holds her eyes on Reed.  He is clearly uncomfortable in

her gaze.  Did the elevator just get smaller?

She shakes her head -- same old Reed.  He looks at her --

what did he say wrong?  Ben smiles, patting Reed on the

shoulder.

She offers a business card.  Reed doesn't take it.

Beat.  Ben grimaces.  Reed takes the card, his eyes down.

Off Ben's curdling smile, we DISSOLVE TO --

EXT. LAKE LAUNCH FACILITY - DAY

A helicopter shot through trees.  We soar over timberland,

and find something massive looming on the horizon:

A SPACECRAFT.  A sleek take on a space shuttle.  Modern tech

combined with industrial design that NASA could never afford.

The craft's nose is pointed straight up, ready for launch.

WORKERS IN JUMPSUITS are scattered around the two-hundred

foot tall scaffolding, performing routine checks.

EXT. GANTRY OVERLOOK - DAY

Ben stares up at the craft.  A sneer on his face.

They walk toward the base of the scaffolding.

CLOSE on JOHNNY STORM, leaning over to kiss a hot redhead.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL he's riding a MOTORCYCLE, and she's

driving a red CORVETTE with license plate: FRANKIE.  PICK UP

Reed and Ben, watching through binoculars.

INT. LAKE LAUNCH FACILITY LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT

Reed and Ben unpack gear into lockers.  Suddenly --

Ben goes to attention on reflex: Johnny snaps a picture with

a digital camera.  Then advances, as Ben realizes who it

is...

Ben eyeballs Johnny, suddenly reaches up as if to grab him.

Johnny flinches.  But Ben just reaches for Johnny's zipper,

adjusts his uniform.

Sue enters, wearing her blue, wetsuit-like uniform, carrying

a stack of flightsuits.  She hands them out to the guys.

Reed stares at Sue in the skintight outfit.  She wonders,

maybe hopes -- is he actually checking her out?

Victor enters, wearing his custom-tailored flightsuit.

A DOOR OPENS.  Leonard enters, in a sharp suit.

EXT. LAKE LAUNCH FACILITY - HALLS - NIGHT

Leonard leads Victor through the halls.  Victor checks

himself in mirrors as he walks, fixing his hair, his uniform.

Leonard pulls out a BOX.  Opens it: a TEN KARAT DIAMOND RING.

They hit a set of big doors.  Victor stops and looks into the

reflective, metallic surface on the wall.  He fixes one last

strand of hair.  Perfect. Then he opens the door to...

SNAP!SNAP!SNAP!  WHIP-PAN a row of CAMERAS snapping shots of --

EXT. LAKE LAUNCH FACILITY - NIGHT

Retrofitted into a makeshift press area.  Victor sits on a

platform, with reporters stretched out below him.

BEHIND THE ACTION: Reed, Sue, Johnny and Ben walk past.  News

crews barely notice, passing without even taking a picture.

Our "Fantastic Four" are not exactly big news.  Not yet.

Just past the press area, they see...one woman standing,

waiting.  This is DEBBIE, Ben's fiancee.  And for the first

time in the entire film...Ben SMILES.  They hug, kissing.

Johnny and Reed watch.  Reed glances at Sue, who walks ahead.

Debbie slips a photo into Ben's flightsuit.  A tender beat.

Ben looks at the little ENGAGEMENT RING on her finger.

Reed nods, smiles.  Debbie gives Ben a last kiss.  Ben turns

to Johnny, who gives a cocky smile.

Ben just glares at Reed.  This is going to be a long trip.

As they follow after Sue, we CUT BACK TO --

VICTOR ON STAGE

Mid-speech.  Playing behind him is REED'S HOLOGRAM: stars

give way to a pulsating red cloud...

Ben and Reed hear the speech.  Ben bristles.

Victor smiles at the crowd, commanding.  A true leader.

The red cloud of cosmic rays wash over the Earth.

On those words, the HOLOGRAM TRANSFORMS TO...Von Doom's

SHUTTLE on the launch pad.  BOOM!  THRUSTERS FIRE WHITE HOT.

Smoke billows across the pad.  Ready for take off.

Victor walks past the hologram and exits.  His departure

perfectly timed with the shuttle LIFTING OFF.

We push in on the shuttle, and follow the ship as it leaves

Earth's atmosphere.  BOOM -- booster rockets fall away and

the shuttle fires its thrusters.  The hologram transitions

to...

A shot of the SPACE STATION high above the Earth.  The

shuttle enters from the top, lighting up the hologram with

engines afire.  As the shuttle approaches the station we CUT

TO --

EXT. DEEP SPACE - SAME

THE SPACE STATION in the distance, rotating in orbit above

Earth.  THE SHUTTLE eases in and docks.

INT. SPACE STATION - COMMAND CENTER - SAME

Victor and Sue lead the others into the command center.

Reed is focused on THE EARTH.

Reed turns towards her -- a little stunned that she would

bring that up.  It's the first time she's been nice to him so

far.  He smiles, gently, hesitantly, always hesitant with

Sue.

Johnny and Ben exchange a look.  Reed keeps looking at the

stars, eyes wide, like a little kid.

INT. SPACE STATION - COMMAND CENTER/OBSERVATION DECK - SAME

They enter the nerve center of the space station.  Victor

goes to a computer console on the observation deck below.

The windows are closed, so there's nothing to observe.

Victor glances at a camera mounted into the console.

Ben turns to Victor.  A little tension.  Reed cuts it:

Victor keeps his eyes on Ben.

Victor gives a friendly smile, patting Reed.

Reed doesn't defend himself.  Ben steps up.

Victor holds tight to his smile.  He nods, condescending.

Ben and Johnny read his eyes, as we CUT TO --

INT. SPACE STATION - AIR LOCK - LATER

Ben preps for a space walk, putting on a helmet and boots.

Johnny unloads a set of clear sample boxes off of a cart,

each containing a variety of plants.

Johnny steps out of the air-lock and shuts the door.  He

looks through a small window to see Ben give the thumbs up.

THE AIRLOCK DOOR opens, and Ben gracefully steps into space.

INT. SPACE STATION - OBSERVATION DECK - SAME TIME

Sue descends the stairs at Victor's behest.  Joins him.

Sue's eyes narrow.  What is this about...?

He presses a button and the observation deck's outer windows

open up, revealing a spectacular, romantic view of the EARTH.

While she stares out the window, Victor reaches into a

pocket, revealing a RING BOX.  Sue looks unsettled.

INT. SPACE STATION - NEARBY CORRIDOR - SAME TIME

Reed checks data on a work station, set on a wall.  The

results of his calculations are not what he expected... He

sees WIND VELOCITY digits rise.  He does a double-take when

he sees the readout: EVENT THRESHOLD, T-MINUS 10:00.

INT. SPACE STATION - OBSERVATION DECK - SAME TIME

Behind his back, Victor holds the ring box in hand.

Sue doesn't know where this is going.  She treads lightly.

He is about to spring the ring on her.  She looks like a deer

in headlights.  She opens her mouth, and...WHAM!  Doors slam

open.  REED RUSHES INTO THE ROOM.

Victor quickly puts the ring back in his pocket.

Sue quickly moves to a nearby control panel to verify Reed's

claim.  Starts punching buttons.  Confirms Reed's findings

with a nod.  Victor hardens, in control.

EXT. SPACE STATION - MOMENTS LATER

Ben is carefully arranging SAMPLE BOXES OF PLANTS.

Ben turns to see Reed and Johnny staring from a window.

Ben sees Johnny motioning for Ben to look behind him.  Ben

turns and sees: THE COSMIC STORM, rumbling toward the

station.  Not close, but not far.  That gets Ben's attention.

He turns back towards the ship.  BEHIND HIM, the storm grows.

INT. SPACE STATION - COMMAND CENTER - SAME TIME

Victor rushes into the room, looks at the monitors.  Sees the

others near the airlock on one screen, and the approaching

cloud on another.  Anxiety creeps across his face.

INT. SPACE STATION - AIRLOCK DOOR - SAME TIME

Reed and Johnny stand by the airlock, waiting for Ben.  They

heard the automated voice.  It panics Reed.

EXT. OUTER SPACE - MOMENTS LATER

A wake of turbulence from the cloud hits Ben, making it

harder to maneuver.  The cloud's tendrils snake toward him.

INT. SPACE STATION - AIRLOCK DOOR - SAME TIME

They can see Ben outside the window, still twenty yards away.

The entire corridor rumbles.  Lights flicker and spark.  They

watch helplessly.

INT. SPACE STATION - COMMAND CENTER/OBSERVATION DECK - SAME

Sue watches the monitor, also helpless.

Victor, annoyed by the indecisiveness, marches right up to

Sue.  Practically shoves her aside as he hits the INTERCOM.

Sue glares at Victor.  His lack of compassion shocks her.

Victor doesn't bother to wait for a response.  He takes over

the console, punching keys.

Sue glares with as much contempt as her face can muster.

Beat.  She takes a step toward the door.  Not sure what to

do.

With one final glare, she bolts from the room.

INT. SPACE STATION - AIRLOCK DOOR - SAME TIME

Reed bites his lip.  Thinks.  He decides.

One look from Reed tells Johnny, he won't leave without Ben.

Johnny eyes Ben, steels his courage.  He's not going either.

INT. SPACE STATION COMMAND CENTER - DAY

Victor watches the shields slide down.  Alone.  An island.

INT. SPACE STATION - CORRIDOR - SAME TIME

Sue races down the hall.  Not panicked.  With determination.

EXT. SPACE STATION AIR LOCK - DAY

The exterior air lock door slides open.  In agonizing,

weightless slow motion Ben reaches to haul himself inside.

The leading edge of the cloud hits: Ben is pelted by a

hissing mass of space dust, splattering his suit with orange

stains.  Larger particles, small pellets, pepper him.  Ben

hauls himself in the last few feet by pulling on his tether.

INT. SPACE STATION AIR LOCK/COMMAND CENTER - DAY

Johnny punches controls to close the exterior airlock door...

Reed opens a first aid kit, grabs a thermo-elastic blanket...

INT. SPACE STATION - COMMAND CENTER/OBSERVATION DECK - SAME

Clutching the diamond ring, Victor stands defiantly.  Showing

absolutely no concern for the others.  Interested only in the

event itself.  Lights and equipment FALL, CRASHING around

him.

A control panel EXPLODES in Victor's face.  He jumps back,

and into the falling equipment.  Collapses under the weight.

INT. SPACE STATION - AIR LOCK - SAME TIME

Sue rounds a corner, sees Reed and Johnny.

SLOW MOTION: Everyone frozen in position as:

-- JOHNNY is hit with sparks of flame from a control panel.

-- REED REACHES out for Ben and the airlock door.

-- VAPOR STREAM pours down on Sue from a blown gasket.

-- THE SPACE DUST burns into Ben's skin.

SLOW MOTION: Just BEFORE the exterior air-lock door closes, a

SINGLE PARTICLE zips through the narrowing gap and hits Ben

in the back, ripping through his suit.  The exterior door

shuts and seals.  The station loses all power.  DARKNESS.

EXT. SPACE STATION - DAY

As quickly as it came, the cloud passes on and whirls away,

leaving the space station intact.  Power quietly flickers on.

Silence.  Time resumes.  All four pick up exactly where they

left off, unaware of anything that just happened to them.

INT. SPACE STATION COMMAND CENTER - DAY

Victor emerges from the rubble.  He stands, checks his body.

A few scrapes, nothing serious.  A thin, throbbing CUT on his

head.  He touches the wound, but it is not bleeding.

INT. SPACE STATION AIR LOCK - DAY

Reed and Johnny scramble to open the interior air lock door.

Sue joins them, as they pull Ben in.  They try to remove his

helmet.  We don't see his face, but he's clearly unconscious.

INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

A BLACK SCREEN:

SUBJECTIVE CAMERA, BEN'S POV: The blurry image of Johnny

comes slowly into focus, standing beside a hospital bed.

Johnny looks away, as if he can't bear to lay eyes on him.

Johnny picks up a hand mirror on the bed table before Ben can

reach it, reluctant to give it to him.

Ben grabs it from him.  Then slowly raises it to look and see

that...except for some serious stubble, Ben's totally normal.

He cackles as he heads for the door.  Ben heaves the mirror

at him, breaking it into hundreds of pieces.  He turns to the

side-table, and grabs that picture of DEBBIE.  It calms him.

EXT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - ESTABLISHING - DAY

A modern facility of glass and stone, nestled in the forest.

In stark contrast to the lush greenery surrounding it.

INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND HOSPITAL CORRIDOR/SUE'S ROOM - DAY

Reed walks down the hall.  His hair is GRAYING at the

temples.  He passes Johnny, who is smiling, still enjoying

his joke on Ben.  Johnny slows, looking at Reed's hair.

Reed passes a mirror, slowing, seeing his gray hairs.  He

keeps going.  He passes a partially open door.  He stops when

he catches a glimpse of Sue asleep in bed.  He sees a vase of

flowers.  He grabs a couple lilies, and enters.

But Reed sees...the room is already FILLED with expensive

flowers.  All from VICTOR.  Reed is trumped once again.

A DOCTOR writes on Sue's chart.  A wall TV plays a press

conference with Victor, outside the FACILITY.  He looks worse

for wear.  A few hairs out of place, and a small BANDAGE on

his face.  We PUSH INTO the press conference --

Victor pauses.  For the first time.  Just a flicker.

Reed mutes the television.

Reed takes the clipboard, looks for himself.

The Doctor takes his clipboard, and walks out.  Reed steps to

Sue, with the drooping flowers in his hand.  Quiet:

WHOOSH.  A NURSE rolls in with a tray bearing ten more

extravagant bouquets.  Reed looks resigned.  He walks out.

Reed exits, dropping his two wilted lilies into the trash.

Sue opens one eye, as the big lilies land by the bed.

INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

A SEXY NURSE wheels a testing station into Johnny's room.

He's stripped down to Calvins, changing into a ski outfit.

Johnny opens the cardboard box, revealing a colorful

fiberglass object the size of a briefcase.  In the blink of

an eye, he unfolds it into a LONG SNOWBOARD.

The nurse pops a thermometer in his mouth to shut him up.

They both pay more attention to his zipper than the digital

read-out: it runs right up past 98.6, then accelerates fast.

He hands her the thermometer, a quick kiss and he's out the

door.  The machine beeps: Johnny's temperature is 209

DEGREES.

EXT. VON DOOM COMPOUND HOSPITAL PATIO - DAY

Ben finds Reed on a patio with a panoramic view.  Reed works

at a laptop computer.

Ben can see Reed doesn't look too solid.

Reed shakes his head, looking back at his screen.

Ben gets closer, pushing down Reed's computer screen.

Reed considers.  But he can't let it go.  He opens his

computer back up, returning to work.  Ben shakes his head,

looks out at the view.  His eyes catch on something, wheels

turning.

Reed follows Ben's eyes to a lower level patio: SUE.

Reed looks at Ben, resigned.

Reed steps away.  Ben stands alone, an idea sparking.

INT. HELICOPTER/EXT. MOUNTAIN SUMMIT - DAY

The chopper hovers over this pristine peak.  JOHNNY and his

NURSE sit in the chopper-bay, prepping their ski gear.

Johnny's customized snowboard has wild, acrylic patterns.

His Nurse wears a hot pink cat-suit, her skis dangling out.

Their bodies are close: a sexy, competitive flirtation.  They

look down at a death-defying black diamond run.

She pulls down her goggles, jumps out.  Johnny drops out

after her, hitting the snow.  He smolders: literally.  The

snow bank behind him sizzles and starts to melt.

He takes off after her and the chase is on:

EXT. BLACK DIAMOND RUN - DAY

The Nurse knows every inch of the trail, slicing expertly in

and out of the trees through deep powder.  Johnny's a speed

freak, maximizing velocity, closing the gap between them.

Ghostly FLAMES shoot off his hair: his ski cap catches fire,

flies off.  Jets of fire knife through the back of his jacket.

The Nurse looks back: In a burst of speed, Johnny draws even.

She looks over and sees the flames shooting out behind him...

Johnny sees his gloves are burning, flicks them off in alarm.

His body SHUDDERS: the back of his ski suit catches on fire.

A burst of flame launches him down the slope like a rocket.

Nurse loses concentration, falls.  Johnny races away like a

missile, screaming in exhilaration.  He looks back -- no

nurse.

He tries to put out his flaming clothes, and accidentally

VEERS to the LEFT.  He fails to notice the giant CHASM in

front of him.  He faces forward and...

SCREEAAMMS!  LAUNCHING off the cliff, LEGS FLAILING, trying

to catch ground.  FLAMES begin to TRAIL his body as he FALLS

towards the rocks below.  He tries to will his body away.

Instead, his body becomes engulfed in flame.  He is a HUMAN

TORCH!  And for a moment he HOLDS THE AIR -- the fire giving

him some kind of...LIFT.  He maneuvers just over the rocks,

almost making a 90 degree turn.

He looks back at the rocks in disbelief.  But the lift

doesn't last long. He quickly CRASHES, landing HARD into a

snowbank.

He opens his eyes; tries to move but can't.  He's trapped

under snow and ice.  With all his strength, he tries to move,

NO DICE.  Panic sets in. His eyes go wide as the snow around

quickly begins to melt.  Johnny is on fire, and within

seconds he's sitting in a small POND, steam rising from the

water.

The nurse races toward the steam.  Scared, panicked.  She

finds Johnny...smiling, sitting naked in an impromptu hot

tub, staring at his hands.  His body.  Exhilarated.

She smiles and unzips.  The FLAMES DISSOLVE TO...CANDLES IN --

EXT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - VICTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

On an expansive parapet with a billion-dollar view, Victor

prepares a romantic dinner-setting as his staff scurry about.

He checks every fork and knife, with a slightly manic energy.

But Victor is on to the next thought, always strategizing.

Victor looks at the scar, enraged by this defect.  It

glistens in the silver tray.  His eyes are bloodshot,

sleepless.

Leonard looks at the table, the lavish spread.  A beat.

INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND DINING HALL - LATE AFTERNOON

Two dozen EMPLOYEES sit and eat.  Others serve themselves at

the buffet.  Ben and Sue walking into the dining hall --

They turn a corner and find Reed, entering by another door.

He quickly shepherds the two of them toward a quiet table.

Ben's stomach GROWLS; so loud that they all can hear it.

Ben's stomach growls again, even louder this time.

INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND DINING HALL - EVENING

The sun is long gone, and so are most of the diners.  The

room is darker, more romantic.  Ben finishes the last shrimp

on his plate, pushes it away, belches prodigiously.

Sue and Reed stare at him.  Ben's stomach growls again.

This was Ben's plan, but he really isn't feeling well,

unsteady when he walks away.  He looks down at his stomach.

ANGLE: Fireplace.  Sue looks gorgeous in the light.  A beat.

A long beat.  Reed doesn't know where to start with this

woman.

Sue gets up to leave.  Exasperated, Reed tries to think of

something, anything, to say.

She slows down, looking at him.  She was hoping for more.

We see surprise on Sue's face, and...

As if triggered by her emotion, the fireplace light around

her BENDS.  The flames flicker in a ghostly breeze.

She looks more disappointed than angry.

She lets that hang.  A lot of history here.  Quiet, hurt --

she wants Reed to fight for her, to show some emotion.

As Sue's emotions swirl, she slowly...disappears.

He looks up...but all that's left of her is the blush on her

cheek and her bewitching eyes.  He drops his fork, shocked.

She raises her hands, but we don't see them.  We only see a

medical waistband...floating.  Her watch...floating.  Her

clothes appear to be suspended in mid-air.

Sue is invisible.  She shrieks and gets up -- knocking a

GLASS off the table...

SLOW MOTION: The glass flies off the table, tumbling... Reed

instinctively reaches for the bottle: his arm stretches two

feet out of his sleeve -- grabs it just before it hits --

Then snaps back into place.  Reed stares at his arm in

disbelief.  Sue's eyes widen as well.  The rest of Sue

reappears.  They look at each other: mutual alarm.

They look up to see JOHNNY in the doorway, NAKED except for

the nurse's PINK PARKA wrapped around his midsection.

INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - VICTOR'S OFFICE - EARLY EVENING

CLUNK.  The candles burn low on the table.  Victor strides

out, heading for the door.  He runs his hand through his hair

to comb some strays.  A CLUMP comes off in his fingers.  He

PAUSES.  He steps to a mirror, stares at his hair.  His SCAR.

It is longer than the bandage now (as if it SPREAD).  Victor

peels back the bandage, and sees the scar is bluish-gray.

Deep, unhealthy, maybe infected...

INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - HALLWAY - EARLY EVENING

DOUBLE DOORS burst open.  Reed, Sue, and Johnny urgently

walk.

Reed glances over his shoulder.  He stares.  Sue follows his

gaze to see: Johnny's FINGERTIPS are on fire.  He SNAPS his

fingers.  They GO OUT.  He's totally unharmed.

Only one thing on Reed's mind --

EXT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - OUTSIDE BEN'S ROOM - EARLY EVENING

Johnny snaps his fingers -- which generate small explosive

bursts of flame.  He turns it on and off, like the "CLAPPER."

He does it again.  Flame on, flame off.

Reed's about to knock on Ben's door when he hears the

banging, moaning and pleading inside.  Johnny smiles.

INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - BEN'S ROOM - EARLY EVENING

A creepy rippling movement begins beneath the sheet and

gradually intensifies, reflected in the fabric's surface: the

contours of Ben's body are changing, inflating, growing rough

and craggy.  SOUND of grinding heavy rocks.

It all stops.  A beat, then all four legs of the bed give way

and it crashes to the floor.  Under the covers, he groans in

pain, and his voice is DEEPER, GRAVELY, but definitely CLEAR:

INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - OUTSIDE BEN'S ROOM - EARLY EVENING

Reed decides they can't wait any longer.  He kneels to the

floor.  He concentrates, not sure if it will work...

Suddenly, his arm STRETCHES, THIN ENOUGH TO CREEP UNDER THE

DOORJAMB.

INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - BEN'S ROOM - EARLY EVENING

Reed's arm wriggles under the door.  It bends upward, swiping

clumsily, until it finally grabs the knob.  Rubbery fingers

find the latch and unlock the door.

INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - OUTSIDE BEN'S ROOM - EARLY EVENING

Reed focuses, and pulls.  His arm snakes out from under the

door and snaps back into place.  His flesh and bones

reforming before their eyes.  Johnny stares at Reed.

They hear a tremendous SMASH from inside the room.

INT. VON DOOM COMPOUND - BEN'S ROOM - EARLY EVENING

They open the door.  The room is trashed.  Every stick of

furniture smashed to splinters.

Their eyes adjust; there's a huge hole where the window used

to be.  They rush to it.  Looking out they see SOMETHING

LARGE in the distance, running away.

Reed looks out, emotions roiling.  Is that his best

friend...?  Suddenly, Victor comes around the corner (bandage

bigger).

He considers, but never shows weakness.  He nods.

Victor redirects his attention to Sue.

Victor strides off, leaving the others.

We PUSH IN on a picture of Debbie lying on the floor, Reed

knows exactly where Ben is going.

EXT. TRAIN YARD - NIGHT

A view from Brooklyn: Manhattan glistens in the distance.

CAMERA MOVES down to A TRAIN YARD, where we find empty cargo

trains.  We PUSH IN on the main track, where...

A CARGO TRAIN has just stopped.  We hear a cargo DOOR slide

open, then WHUMP!  Big FEET hit the ground.  Someone, or

someTHING barrels into the night.

EXT. BIG & TALL SHOP - NIGHT

A locked storefront on Flatbush Ave.  SOUND of breaking

glass.

INT. BIG & TALL SHOP - NIGHT

SERIES OF SHOTS: Ben tries on clothes, shoes.  Jackets rip,

shoes split.  He needs an extra extra extra large.

EXT. PAY PHONE - NIGHT

A HUGE FIGURE is huddled in shadow.  It's Ben.

CLOSE ON: The dial pad.  Big fingers try to push keys but

they're too large.  Ben tries for a few seconds, getting more

and more frustrated.  He manages to press "0" with his pinky.

Ben looks up the street, into the 2nd story window of a

modest, working-class home.  His eyes go soft when he sees

Debbie grab the phone.

He blinks hard.  Sad, dark.

EXT. BROOKLYN HOUSE - NIGHT

Debbie steps out.  There is "WELCOME HOME" sign over the

door.  She looks out.  The wind blows softly.  Something

shifts in the darkness.  Debbie pulls her robe tighter.

A hanging beat.  And Ben...steps into the light, where we SEE

HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME: he's HUGE, easily twice the size he

once was, and AN ORANGY ROCKY SURFACE COVERS HIS ENTIRE BODY.

Debbie sees him.  Fear washes over her, not sure what to

think.  He reaches out, a little tentative.  She flinches

back.

He reaches out.  She recoils.  It's too much for her.  Tears

swell in her eyes.  Covering her mouth, she backs away.

He takes a step closer.  She backs away faster, tripping over

her robe, falling into the street.  A car screeches to a

halt.  Ben instinctively steps out to help, but she scurries

back.

Her shout wakes NEIGHBORS.  Lights flicker on.  Ben knows he

has to go.  He looks at Debbie, sensing this is the last time

he'll see her.  She trembles, terrified.  His eyes go moist.

With that, he turns away.  The "WELCOME HOME" sign flutters,

falls to the ground.  A tragic tableau.  As more lights go on

around him, Ben picks up his pace, speeding into the dawn.

INT. VICTOR'S COMPOUND OFFICE - DAY

Victor packs a monogrammed Armani briefcase: "VDM" emblazoned

on a gold plate.  Leonard waits not-so-patiently.

Victor turns to Leonard, disappointed with him.

EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY

We swoop toward this epic monument.  On a steel girder above

the road, we see...a STATUE.  BEN.  He sits on the edge of

the beams, staring down at the river below, brooding,

muttering.

A PIGEON flutters past him, and drops a white gooey gift on

his shoulder.  Ben just glares up at the heavens.

He hears the sound of someone SOBBING.  He turns to see...a

distraught BUSINESSMAN with a briefcase.  The man drops his

case, which PLUMMETS hundreds-of-feet into the RIVER.

The Businessman looks out, ready to jump.  He doesn't see Ben

(or doesn't realize Ben is not a statue).

The Businessman looks at Ben, terrified.  Ben steps forward.

Backpedaling, the man SLIPS, FALLING toward the ROADWAY!  His

arms flail, grabbing a narrow beam -- his fingers hold tight

while his legs thrash over speeding traffic.  Cars and trucks

SKIM right underfoot.  Ben shakes his head.

Ben steps out to help, but...his WEIGHT BENDS the beam!  The

Businessman LOSES HIS GRIP!  He FALLS TO THE ROAD, landing

hard on the highway!  A few PEDESTRIANS see Ben.  They point.

Ben looks up, deer in headlights.  He sees a massive TRUCK

bearing down on the Businessman.

Ben DROPS to the street.  WHOOMPF!  He lands in front of the

Businessman, SWEEPS him out of the way with one arm, and

turns to the oncoming 18 WHEELER CAB.

The DRIVER slams his brakes, eyes wide.  The truck SWERVES,

but cannot stop!  Time slows to syrup, as Ben looks a little

scared.  He shuts his eyes, and...

SHOULDER-BLOCKS the INCOMING TRUCK!  A football move.  The

truck BUCKLES, POPPING a WHEELIE, CRUMPLING all the way to

the windshield!  It looks like a metal car-compactor.

The truck SWERVES hard, its tail SMASHING into steel girders.

CARS SCREECH, SWERVE, SLAMMING INTO EACH OTHER, CAUSING A

FOUR-LANE TRAFFIC ACCIDENT!  Windows shatter, fires flicker.

One of the cars in an NYPD CRUISER.  COPS clamber out.

EXT. CAB ON HIGHWAY - DAY

Reed, Johnny, and Sue sit in the back.  They see the action

on the bridge.  Reed and Sue lock eyes, sensing the worst.

EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY

Ben stands in the middle of the chaos, staring at the

destruction.  He sees the tow-truck DRIVER bleeding, trapped

in his cab.  Ben moves to this burning hunk of steel.

He SWIPES through the shattered window, and PUNCHES the

airbag, POPPING it like a kid's balloon.  He tries to grab

the seat-belt, but his fingers are TOO BIG.  He struggles.

The driver is too woozy.  Ben can't get to the button.

Frustrated, he simply TEARS OFF THE DOOR, and RIPS THE

DRIVER'S SEAT right out of the cab!  COPS round the corner.

They see Ben holding onto the Driver.  They raise their guns.

Ben looks at the cops.  PEDESTRIANS stare, point.  He

realizes how this must look -- a monster holding a bloody man

in hand.

EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - APPROACH - DAY

At the back of the traffic jam, cars SCREECH to stops.  The

whole bridge is FULL of bumper-to-bumper traffic.  We PUSH

TOWARD one car: three doors pop open, and out come...

REED, JOHNNY, SUE.  They look through smoke and mayhem to

see...their first full look at Ben.  Reed stands gutpunched.

EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY

Ben puts the seat down, with the Driver on it.  He lunges

behind a truck.  The cops try to follow, but FLAMES push them

back.  Ben lurches away, head down, self-conscious.

He tries to hide from ONLOOKERS around him and PEDESTRIANS on

walkways overhead.  He wants to escape, but hears SCREAMING

MOTORISTS.  He grits his teeth, and moves to help them.

EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - GRIDLOCK - DAY

Reed, Sue, and Johnny race toward the flames.  All other

people head in the OPPOSITE DIRECTION.  BRIDGE POLICE herd

the crowd away from the accident.

Reed, Sue, and Johnny slow down, swap glances.

MOVE IN ON REED.  A first test of leadership.  But he is not

a leader.  Not yet.  Sue gets closer to him.

A hard beat.  Reed signals Sue with a look, a nod.

He motions to her body.  She understands.  She concentrates,

and starts to turn invisible.

But her clothes don't go invisible.  Beat.  Reed mutters:

She unbuttons her blouse.  Not thrilled with the idea.  She

wriggles out of her pants.  Down to her skivvies.  She

reaches back to undo her bra...momentarily loses

concentration and becomes visible.  The sight of Sue in her

undies grabs the COPS' attention.  Everyone watches, stunned.

The realization that she's visible hits her like a ton of

bricks.  Cops are transfixed.  So is Reed.

Sue takes a deep breath.  Closes her eyes.  Focuses.  Nothing

happens.  She's embarrassed and furious.

...and she DISAPPEARS.  Entirely.  Undies float.  Jaws drop.

She stops ranting.  Realizes she's gone invisible.

The undies drop.  The cops stare open-mouthed.  They turn to

look at Reed, astonished.  He sheepishly shrugs his

shoulders.

A beat.  She walks away.  The cops watch her, gaping.  By the

time they turn back around, Reed and Johnny are gone,

disappearing into the clouds of smoke.

EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY

A news CHOPPER flies around the bridge, fighting for the best

angle on the action.

EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - ACCIDENT - DAY

Reed races through wreckage.  He tries to see over a big

TRUCK, and his neck STREEETCHES!

He finally sees...BEN.  Reed wraps around a car, and...BOO!

His face snakes right in front of Ben.  Ben jumps.

He motions to Reed's neck.  Then to his own body:

Reed opens his mouth, but he has no answer.  Not yet.

Ben spins, looking for Sue.  He can't see her.  But he does

see...A CAR INCHES AWAY, WITH GAS TANK FLAMING!

BOOOOM!  The first car BLOWS!  BOOOM!BOOOOM!BOOOOOM!  Empty

cars BLOW in a chain-reaction.  The flames are mushrooming!

Reed SWIPES his ARMS OUT, holding people back.  His arms

FLATTEN to form a barricade -- FACES INDENT his skin.

FLAMES lash out.  A pack of attractive YOUNG WOMEN scream.

Johnny LEAPS toward them.  His feet LEAVE THE GROUND, giving

him extra lift.  He SPINS, lands, and embraces the women,

SHIELDING them from flames which burn up his back.  He looks

the ladies up and down, and gives a cheesy smile.

Sue SCREAMS.  She puts her hands up (a normal reflex).  The

air seems to RIPPLE around her hands, like FORCE-FIELDS.

She looks at them, surprised, confused.  Her invisible fields

SPIRAL OUT, partially CONTAINING the blast.  But the flames

hurtle closer.  She fights the pressure.  Blood trickles from

her nose.  Just as the white hot blast is about to hit her...

Sue is dressed again.  Visible.  She SCREAMS, and PUSHES THE

FORCE DOWN INTO THE ROAD!  She collapses, as the blast

deflects off the street and into...

An oncoming FIRETRUCK!  BOOOOM!  The firetruck is KNOCKED OFF

THE GROUND, SLEWING SIDEWAYS.  Brakes scream.  Its tail

slashes out, PUNCHING through the guard-rail.

THE BACK OF THE TRUCK DANGLES OUT, HUNDREDS OF FEET ABOVE THE

WATER!  FIREMEN hang off the back and sides.  The truck

TEETERS, falling!  Ben wastes no time.  He GRABS onto the

front of the truck, just as it goes off the side!

He DIGS his heels into the ground, but his feet DRAG across

the concrete, digging grooves into the street.

ON THE DANGLING FIRETRUCK: FIREMEN climb out, clawing toward

the bridge.  Their truck SWINGS.  Bits and pieces tumble down

at them -- a hose, an axe, a helmet.  All deadly now.  The

HANGING LADDER swoops down, with men RIDING ON IT!

Ben SCREAMS!  STRAINING with all his might.  Ben SCREAMS!

His muscles ripple, and...he takes his first step...back.

Another scream.  Another step.  Another.  Another.  Epic,

painful.

He is pulling the truck back onto the bridge, inch by inch.

His footsteps THUD.  With monumental effort, he levels the

truck.  Firemen scurry over hoses and ladders, some climbing

over Ben.

Reed tends to Sue who has fainted from her effort.  Ben steps

back from the truck and slumps to the street exhausted.  Wary

cops close in to cover him with weapons, but...

The FIREMEN slowly begin to APPLAUD.  The crowd of onlookers

joins in as well.  Sue, Reed, and Johnny seem surprised,

touched by the reaction.  But Ben seems uncomfortable.

Firemen step forward to offer Reed a couple of their coats;

he hands one to Johnny and uses the other to cover Sue.

EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - DAY

Ben sees a familiar face in the masses: DEBBIE.  Ben steps

toward her, but she stops him with a look.  She places

something on the ground and runs off into the crowd.

Ben sees something GLISTENING on the ground.  He stoops over

to pick up...her ENGAGEMENT RING.  His big fingers can't grip

it.  He tries in vain.  Hopeless, pathetic.  A beat.  And...

A hand grabs the ring.  It's Reed.  Quiet, close.

Off the wounded look in Ben's eyes, wanting to believe him...

INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

Victor sits with remote in hand, staring at his plasma TV.

ON THE TV: he sees a crowd of firemen applauding the new

Fantastic Four.  For the first time they strike a heroic

pose.  Leonard enters, with a phone in his hand.

Victor sees Reed put his arms around Sue as he covers her

with the jacket. And the penny drops: he's FURIOUS.  As it

hits him, he feels something odd.  He looks down at his

hand...at glints of gleaming METAL poking through flesh.

EXT./INT. EMERGENCY HOLDING AREA - DAY

An impromptu command center -- a series of police tents,

surrounded by EMERGENCY VEHICLES, NEWS VANS, FIRETRUCKS.

INT. EMERGENCY HOLDING AREA - TENT - DAY

Reed, Sue, Ben and Johnny sit together, getting changed.

They get ready to go, but the CHIEF FIREMAN enters, stopping

them.

He turns on a little TV MONITOR in the corner.  NEWS FOOTAGE

plays on all stations, with the tagline: FANTASTIC FOUR.

Johnny heads for the exit.

Johnny pauses.  Rubs his chin once.  And...

He runs out.  Sue, Ben, and Reed swap glances, knowing Johnny

cannot be their spokesman.  They take off after him, out to --

EXT. EMERGENCY HOLDING AREA - PRESS FIELD - DAY

CLICKCLICKCLICK!  Fifty cameras flash.  The field is full of

press.  Our heroes freeze, shocked by the crowd.

Johnny eats up the attention.  Ben turns, self-conscious.

Reed notices.  The Chief Fireman turns to them.

Johnny does not hesitate.

A beat.  Sue and Ben turn to Reed.  The Chief hands him a

mic.

All eyes go on Reed.  He looks out, gulps hard.  A long beat.

Nobody came for a science class.  A crush of questions

overwhelms Reed:

Reed looks at Ben's face, feeling the guilt.  Ben is lost in

thought, looking at Deb's ENGAGEMENT RING.  Johnny leaps in.

The Reporter nods toward Ben.  Ben's fists tighten, the sound

of rocks crushing together.  Reed feels the pain.

Reporters laugh.  Ben turns his head away.  Reed burns.

Reed, Sue, and Ben get up to go.  The press waits a beat,

then surges.  Ben spins, holding up one finger.  A giant.

The press step back, intimidated.  Flashbulbs POP, and Ben's

FACE FREEZES.  It goes BLACK-AND-WHITE on a NEW YORK POST in --

EXT. BANK - DAY

Establishing shot of a historic New York building.

INT. BANK - CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

BANKERS sit around a table.  LAPTOPS hum.  The lead banker is

power-broker NED CECIL.  The men keep their eyes on Victor.

Ned motions to the paper, the picture of BEN.

Victor's grip tightens around the table, and...the LAPTOPS

FLICKER, losing feeds.

Victor looks down at his hands -- a private beat (did I do

that?)  He lets go of the table; screens go back to normal.

Victor looks at him, blood boiling, and we CUT HARD TO --

INT. BANK - HALLWAY - DAY

Victor and Leonard stride out.  Victor is writhing.

Leonard is thinking all business.

Victor considers.  His mind races, eyes narrow.

Leonard nods, impressed.  Victor is a man in motion.  As they

step into sunlight, we cut to...CLICKCLICKCLICK in --

EXT. BAXTER BUILDING - DAY

REPORTERS snap pictures.  A POLICE CONVOY drives up, stopping

in front of a towering HIGH-RISE.  Sue, Reed, and Johnny and

get out of a police-car. Ben steps out of a BIG PADDY-WAGON,

which immediately bounces back up to the normal axle

position.

COPS hold back the surging press.  Ben keeps his head down,

self-conscious.  He passes Johnny, smiling for the cameras.

Ben turns to a group of LITTLE KIDS.  Stiff, tentative:

The kids FLINCH.  Ben trudges on.  Johnny smiles bright,

doing hand-signs for F4.  Sue pulls him toward --

INT. BAXTER BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY

The Fantastic Four enter.  They are greeted by JIMMY

O'HOOLIHAN, an old-time doorman with a kind smile.

He motions to the flashing cameras outside.

He searches for the name.  Sue steps up.

He smiles at Sue, then at Reed.

He opens a drawer full of LETTERS from the BANK.  Reed looks

sheepish.  He shuts the drawer, looks to Johnny and Sue.

Reed looks at Ben.  Thanks a lot.  DING.  Elevator doors

open.

INT. BAXTER BUILDING - ELEVATOR - DAY

They enter.  Reed hits the top button, for the 20TH FLOOR.

The doors close, but...the ELEVATOR does not move.  A beat.

A digital readout on the panel: EXCEED MAXIMUM WEIGHT.  A

sign reads: MAXIMUM CAPACITY: 2000 pounds.  They turn to Ben.

Doors open.  He lumbers out.  As the doors close behind him,

he looks back over his shoulder, locking eyes with Reed.

INT. BAXTER BUILDING - ELEVATOR - DAY

The elevator rises.  Reed roils with guilt.

Happen to all of them.  Reed nods softly.

Reed considers.  But Sue cuts him short with a look.

DING!  The elevator stops.

INT. BAXTER BUILDING - ATRIUM - MOMENTS LATER

The elevator opens.  They step out.  They might be on the

20th floor, but Reed owns the building from here to floor

sixty.  It's a massive atrium, lit by skylights far above --

Reed leads them into another area filled with separate

"apartments" and all the amenities of home.

EXT. BAXTER BUILDING - DAY

The press has died down, but there are still plenty of

cameras.  A MAYBACH SEDAN rolls up.  Victor emerges, wearing

sunglasses.  This time, the press pay no attention to him.

No cameras flash.  Victor tightens, and enters the building.

INT. SUE'S ROOM - DAY

Sue walks out of the bathroom in a robe, drying her hair.

She notices a familiar book on a shelf: a SCRAPBOOK.

She flips through it.  It's filled with pictures of Reed and

his inventions -- a lot less fancy than Victor's multimedia

globe.  She stops at a picture of her and Reed in COLLEGE.

A noise, and she turns, flinching slightly, surprised to

see...VICTOR.  He smiles, standing at the door, watching her.

She notices the scar on his head.

He goes for her bag.  But she stops him.  A half beat.

Victor is not used to being rebuffed.  He gives a thin smile.

A tense beat.  Standoff.  Made more tense by --

They turn to see Reed approaching, with files in hand.

Victor pauses.  He looks at Sue, knowing she's here to stay.

Victor shakes Reed's hand.  His GRIP is so tight that Reed's

fingers STRETCH.  Victor lets go, and turns to Sue, who puts

her hand out.  He smiles, and shakes.  He heads off.

Reed looks at his hand.  Shakes his wrist.  He looks at

Victor.

INT. BAXTER BUILDING - HALL - DAY

Victor moves fast, holds tight to his anger.  Reed catches

up.

Victor suddenly WHEELS on Reed.  Lights flicker.

Reed sees Victor's SCAR maybe growing.  Lights dim.

They turn to see...BEN down the hall, leaning in a doorway.

Victor tightens, looking at Ben's massive rock-hewn body.

He turns back to Reed.  Close, quiet.  Lights flicker.

Victor steps away, toward the elevator.  He passes Ben, who

just smiles and waves "goodbye."  Before Victor's finger taps

the down-button, the button lights up (as if the circuit

responded to him).  Reed exhales, shaken.  Victor steps into --

INT. BAXTER BUILDING - ELEVATOR - DAY

The doors close, and Victor really LETS LOOSE.  He SLAMS his

fist into a STEEL WALL.  The wall BUCKLES, steel DENTING.

Victor shakes out his hand, and sees...a rippling METALLIC

SHELL under the skin.  He stares at it in horror.  The dark

surface pulsates with electric energy.  What is he

becoming...?

INT. BAXTER BUILDING LABS - DAY

Sue works the controls.  Reed approaches Ben with an

ELECTRODE NEEDLE.  He tries to stick the needle into Ben, but

it SNAPS.

Ben looks to Sue for translation.

Reed shakes his head.  He approaches with an X-RAY MACHINE.

He turns on the X-ray machine.  The graph shows SOLID ROCK.

The rays don't penetrate.  Sue and Reed look confused.

Reed grabs a BLOOD PRESSURE MACHINE, but the strap is way too

short to wrap around Ben's arm.  Reed stands stumped.  He

looks at his tray full of instruments.  He picks up the

little rubber REFLEX-HAMMER.  But it looks miniscule compared

to Ben.

Reed has an idea.  He opens a drawer full of HARDWARE TOOLS.

He pulls of a real HAMMER.  He approaches Ben.

He taps Ben's knee lightly, and BEN'S LEG KICKS!  SLAMMING

UP!  RIGHT BETWEEN REED'S LEGS!  The ultimate kick in the

crotch.  Reed STRETCHES UP a few feet, then SNAPS BACK,

wincing.

INT. BAXTER BUILDING LABS - DAY

From their second level control room, Reed and Sue observe

Johnny in an enclosed fire-proof chamber.  Flames escape

through the vents of the chamber...he's fully torched!

Reed watches the read-out: it climbs from 2000 to 4000

degrees Kelvin.  They are essentially taking his temperature.

INSIDE THE CHAMBER: Johnny turns white hot, blinding to look

at: the chamber walls begin to glow red.  Machines go

haywire.

His feet even start to LIFT OFF THE GROUND, LEVITATING a foot

or two.  He looks down, excited, burning hotter and hotter.

He won't stop.  Reed pulls a switch on the wall.  FOAM sprays

out of nozzles, dousing Johnny's flames.  He stands there,

covered in thick FOAM.  His body steams.  So does his temper.

Reed looks at the control panels.

Frustrated, Reed looks at the smoking system.  And we CUT TO --

INT. BAXTER BUILDING - LAB - DAY

Reed and Ben sit in chairs, facing each other.  A beat

passes.  Ben taps his fingers on the chair, making small

DENTS.  Reed looks down at his clipboard.  A little awkward.

INT. BAXTER BUILDING - LAB - DAY

Reed and Johnny now.  Johnny exercises.  Reed stands nearby.

Clipboard in hand.

Reed sighs.  It's going to be a long process.

INT. BAXTER BUILDING LAB - DAY

Reed and Sue, tables turned: Reed observes her through a

prismatic device measuring light refraction.  He "sees" her

through the device: lit up like some heavenly creature.  He's

having a hard time concentrating.  He focuses on his work.

He tightens, uncomfortable with being center of attention.

She reaches for his arm, like a specimen.  He pulls away, but

she sees a glimpse of BRUISES on his ARMS.  She slows down.

He nods, rolls down his sleeves.

She considers.  A little vulnerable.

A beat.  Reed drops his eyes, makes a note, back to work.

She is annoyed.  Reed is oblivious.

She looks at Reed, eyes narrow.  She becomes invisible.  As

she focuses on Reed -- and gets angry -- a small, clear FORCE

FIELD forms around her body.  The force-field BENDS LIGHT

around a MICROSCOPE, which goes INVISIBLE.  Reed steps out to

ask...

The FORCE-FIELD shoots in all directions, knocking everything

over in a fifteen foot radius.  Reed is thrown from his

chair.

An awkward beat.

She didn't want to get into this.  She looks down,

vulnerable.

The question stumps him.  A beat.  He struggles.

Her words penetrate.  He knows she's right.  He looks away.

He struggles for the words.

He opens his mouth, but...WHAM!  Doors open.  Johnny enters,

wearing a CHARRED SHIRT.  He points to the burned scraps of

his shirt.

INT. BAXTER BUILDING LABS - DAY

ANGLES of Reed in the lab, grabbing their space uniforms from

various closets/containers:

REVEAL: Reed, Sue, and Johnny step out to look at themselves

in a mirror wearing the uniforms.  No boots, no gloves.  Not

yet.  (The uniforms will develop, like our heroes).

Johnny shakes his head, frustrated.

He marches out.  Sue turns to Reed, who says nothing.  Sue

heads out, leaving Ben and Reed.  A beat.  Ben looks at Reed.

Off Reed's dark look, we hear:

INT. VON DOOM INDUSTRIES - VICTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

CLOSE ON: an X-RAY.  Victor's ARM.  The metallic

transformation is higher now.  PULL BACK TO REVEAL: Victor

and his DOCTOR.  In the wall behind them: ancient armor

(maybe we noticed it before, maybe not).  It adds a little

menace to the room.

Victor hardens, razor sharp.

WHHM!  Victor GRABS the Doctor by the throat.

Victor's grip TIGHTENS around the man's throat.

With one cobra-swift move, Victor thrusts his metallic arm

into the doctor, killing him instantly.  Victor retracts his

arm, and looks at it, shocked by his own strength.

INT. BAXTER BUILDING - REED'S OFFICE - NIGHT

A SERIES OF TIME-LAPSE SHOTS: REED works around the Baxter

Building, spending hours searching for the cure.  He checks

charts, writes equations, paces, frustrated.

Finally, he sits at his long desk, looking at a wall where

Ben's CHARTS are projected (both Ben and Thing's anatomies).

Reed wears the uniform under his labcoat.  He checks his

equations over and over, making notes upon notes.

He hits the end of the slides.  The wall fills with white

light.  Frustrated, Reed SLAMS his head into his desk, CRASH!

Something FALLS off the end of the desk.

Reed raises his head, revealing his flattened face.  He steps

over to see...a PLANT SAMPLE from space, glass box shattered.

Red sparks swirl around the plant, like the cosmic storm --

THE COSMIC STORM swirls, terrifying.  We slowly PULL BACK TO --

INT. BAXTER BUILDING - MAIN LAB - NIGHT

The STORM is a computer-image on screen now.  Behind the

screen are six chalkboards full of Reed's calculations and

the scribbled beginnings of a MACHINE.

We PULL BACK to see his arm stretched across the room writing

on the end of another chalkboard.

He's moving fast, excited, almost a little manic.  He

hears...a CREAK.  He slows down, but doesn't look up to see

SUE enter.

He rifles through a desk drawer, then heads out.  Sue stands

there, looking at the storm.  Concerned.  Then we CUT TO --

INT. BAXTER BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Sue follows Reed.  He flips through a file, excited.

She looks at him.

He keeps his head down, making notes, entering --

INT. BAXTER BUILDING - STOREROOM - NIGHT

Reed and Sue enter.  Reed is looking for something.  Sue

slows down, staring at this sprawling space, jam-packed with

GEAR, GADGETS, BLUEPRINTS, INVENTIONS.  Awe-inspiring,

overflowing.

She stares at shelves upon shelves of overcrowded clutter.

Reed finds his electron microscope.  He turns to Sue,

defensive:

She starts to pull out a MODEL of the FANTASTICAR.

The little car sets the whole shelf off balance.  A WAVE OF

INVENTIONS COME CLATTERING DOWN!  Reed moves fast:

He LUNGES toward Sue, STREETCHING his ARMS AROUND the SHELF,

pushing Sue away, just as the INVENTIONS SMASH TO THE GROUND!

Reed and Sue hit the floor.  A close call.  Now more

closeness: Sue and Reed lay face-to-face, with Reed's wrapped

around her.  A heated beat.  Their first real intimate

moment.

As if suddenly made aware of their vulnerability, Sue and

Reed stand, backing off.  As they part, we see:

BEN watching from the doorway.  Melancholy.  He disappears.

We slowly MOVE TO...A SURVEILLANCE CAMERA in a VENT GRATE.

INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Victor watches a bank of videoscreens.  He has the Baxter

Building under surveillance.  He sees Reed and Sue on

monitors.  He toys with Sue's diamond ring in his gloved

hand.

A door opens.  Leonard enters.  He sees the screens.

Victor looks at that image of Reed and Sue on the screen.

But Victor sees something between Reed and Sue on the wall.

He leans closer, and the camera ZOOMS IN, as if responding to

his will.  He ZOOMS all the way to a CLOSE UP of:

REED'S BLUEPRINTS FOR THE TRANSFORMATION CHAMBER.  Victor's

eyes narrow, mind ticking, a plan forming.

Victor opens a drawer, pulls out an old VIDEOTAPE.

Victor leans forward, fixated on that machine.  As he gets

closer, his screens go STATICKY.  He absentmindedly picks at

his SCAR.  In shadows, we see skin peeling off.

INT. BAXTER BUILDING - MEDIA ROOM - NIGHT

BEN GRIMM stands front and center.  Not the Thing.  But BEN

GRIMM.  A normal man.  He smiles wide, shaking his head.

Now we PULL BACK to reveal DEBBIE and BEN on a SCREEN.  The

Thing watches the old videotape.  He smiles sadly at his old

life.  He mouths the words -- he knows this tape by heart.

ON SCREEN: the handheld camera whips around, revealing...a

SURPRISE PARTY.  Full of people.  Ben Grimm is a popular guy.

On screen: Reed hugs Ben.  They pose for pictures together.

We hear the party sing "HAPPY BIRTHDAY."  Debbie kisses Ben.

Thing's eyes start to mist.  On screen: Ben blows out

candles.

As they kiss, a tear runs down Thing's cheek.  The tape ends,

and he sits in darkness for a beat.  A long, lonely beat.

INT. BAXTER BUILDING - HALLS - NIGHT

Ben stalks the halls, slipping into his ragged trenchcoat.

As he passes a crossroads, he sees a strange sight:

REED'S HAND is TIED to a latch in the wall.  His ARM is

STREEETCHED THIN, spanning around the corner.  Ben just

shakes his head, keeps moving.  And we FOLLOW REED'S ARM...

UP THE HALL...ROUND A CORNER...DOWN ANOTHER HALL.  The

muscles and tissue STRETCH, going taut.  Finally, we reach...

REED.  He steps slowly.  He holds a digital TAPE-MEASURE in

his other hand, measuring distance.  His skin STREEETCHES.

His face tightens, pained.  We hear the faint SQUEAK of his

skin.

Reed turns his head around, seeing JOHNNY come down the hall.

Reed keeps moving, slowly.  His muscles and tendons laboring.

And Johnny is GONE, ducking under Reed's arm into --

INT. BAXTER BUILDING - KITCHEN - NIGHT

Johnny opens a cupboard, pulls out some JIFFY POP.  It starts

to POP in his hand, the bag swelling.  He casually turns on a

TV, flipping to...the X- GAMES.  The Jiffy Pop swells, ready

to blow.  He rips it open, eats popcorn, and watches the

games:

Cool stunts, hot girls.  Johnny's brow furrows, a thought

forming, a mischievous smile on his lips.

EXT. BAXTER BUILDING - SIDE EXIT - NIGHT

A FIGURE exits, wearing that ragged trenchcoat and fedora.

Ben disappears into the dark night, and we CUT TO --

EXT. BROOKLYN STREET - NIGHT

Dark.  Lights flicker.  Steam rises through the grates.  A

shadow emerges.  Ben.  He heads toward O'DONNEL'S PUB, a

classic Brooklyn tavern.  Neon sign.  Music, life inside.

Ben pulls his hat low, turns up his collar, and squeezes

through the door into --

INT. O'DONNEL'S PUB - NIGHT

A big photo of Ben Grimm in his astronaut heyday occupies a

place over the bar.  Ben enters, and the bar goes SILENT.  He

moves through the crowd.  People clear out of the way.

Ben reaches the bar.  He sits on a stool, and CRUNCH!  SMASH!

The stool SNAPS like a toothpick.  He hits the ground hard.

Glasses shake.  A few PATRONS smile, laugh softly.

They go silent.  They drop bills onto tables, filing out,

scared of this monster.  ERNIE works the bar.

But the patrons keep filing out.  Ben looks down, weary.

Ernie heads for the booze.  Ben gives a sad shake of his

head.  Then he notices...one lone patron at the end of the

bar.  A beautiful young woman nursing a drink.  Meet ALICIA

MASTERS.

She turns to him, unafraid.  He notices her blank stare, lack

of focus, and white cane.  Alicia is blind.

Ben takes his drink, but SMASH!  His grip shatters the glass,

spilling all over himself.  He smiles ruefully.

He grabs a bar-rag to dry off.

She knocks back her drink, grabs her cane, steps toward Ben.

Ben doesn't say anything.  A little unnerved by this woman.

She puts a hand on his face -- something in her tone and

gentle touch allows Ben to let her.  She smiles softly.

She smiles softly, takes her cane, and starts to head out.

Right as she hits the door, over her shoulder --

Ben watches her disappear.  He sees a few people staring.  He

lowers his head, turns back to the bar, and finds a new

drink, in a steel MARTINI SHAKER.  He knocks it back.

EXT./INT. UPSCALE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

Lights twinkle.  A MAITRE D' leads us through fancy digs.

Heads turn, whispers flutter.  SUE steps out, joining...

Victor at a prime table.  He pulls out her chair, wearing

gloves.

She nods, a little self-conscious.

Sue senses where this is going, and she cuts it short.

He is cold as ice.  If he's hurt, he'll never show it.

She pauses.  Then:

She holds tight, keeping cool.

The words sting.  She can't help but hear some truth in them.

Victor's fist CLENCHES -- metal SFX.

Victor SCREECHES his chair back, PUSHING the table so hard

that he SPILLS water.  Heads turn, all eyes on Sue.  Victor

gets close to her, too close, a hand on her shoulder.

He walks out.  As he goes, he slips the engagement ring out

of his pocket.  He crushes the diamond to dust, leaves the

dust in an ashtray, and disappears into the night.

Sue sits embarrassed.  She slowly...disappears.  People gasp.

She walks out, invisible, save for her clothes, which DRIFT

through the air.  At a TABLE FULL OF BUSINESSMEN --

The other men laugh, but WHHM!  The man's wine SPILLS into

his LAP!  Sue walks out.  The restaurant is left buzzing.

Lights twinkle.  And we FADE OUT.  A beat.  Then we CRASH

INTO --

EXT. NYC ARENA - ESPN MOTO X GAMES - DAY

The X games in full effect: A maze of mountainous dirt hills

and ramps...where MOTO-BIKES launch into the air to the

delight of 20,000 fans.  The Riders spin and flip, performing

aerial acrobatics on their 250CC motor bikes.

JOHNNY emerges, wearing his blue uniform, waving to the

crowd.  He steps up to the pit where RIDERS prep.  He

beelines to RONNIE RENNER.

Ronnie gives a tight nod.  He doesn't like being upstaged by

this circus freak.

The other bikers approach.

He motions to his BIKE.  Johnny eyes this mean machine.

We PUSH IN on Johnny, his ego getting stoked, as we CUT TO --

INT. NYC ARENA - TRACK - DAY

Ronnie jams down the track, kicking dirt back at Johnny.

Johnny now wears a MOTOCROSS OUTFIT over his uniform, with

the number "004" on the back and a small 4 over his heart.

Ronnie hits the first hill, and CATCHES AIR, FLIPPING HIGH!

The CROWD goes wild.  Now it's Johnny's turn.  He hits the

hill and pulls the exact same move.  With even more height!

Johnny sticks the landing.  The crowd swells.  Ronnie

tightens, pulls his throttle harder, taking the next jump,

and...MAKING AN INSANE MOVE, CORKSCREWING IN THE AIR!

He lands clean.  The crowd is ready to explode.  Johnny REVS

his engine, his body starting to STEAM, adrenaline burning.

He hits the hill, and pulls an even gnarlier SPIN!

Johnny lands.  The crowd roars.  Ronnie bears down on the

last hill.  He leans over his handlebars.

Ronnie hits the hill, pulls this JAW-DROPPING DEATH-DEFYING

STUNT!  The crowd is deafening!  Ronnie smiles.  And...

JOHNNY SPEEDS FASTER, FASTER.  Trails of FLAME start to

streak off his back!  He RACES LIKE A ROCKET UP THE HILL!

LAUNCHING TO IMPOSSIBLE HEIGHTS!  SPINNING LIKE A TOP!  A

FLAMING BLUR!

And now for the really impressive part: Johnny's bike starts

to drop, but JOHNNY KEEPS RISING!  He FLAMES ON, spiraling

upward!  For a few seconds, he's actually...almost...flying.

A beat.  Time suspended.  And...WHHM!  He PLUMMETS back down!

LANDS on his bike in mid-air!  And sticks a perfect landing,

maybe even kicking a little dirt up at Ronnie.  Johnny

swerves to a stop, with a "holy shit" look on his face.  What

the hell just happened??

A new name is born.  The crowd goes berserk.  Standing

ovation.  Riders rush up to Johnny.  Kenny sees his bike:

THE SEAT MELTED, WHEELS BURNED OFF.  Johnny smiles.

HOT GIRLS swarm.  As Johnny gets swallowed by fans, we see a

scary thing flicker in his eyes: the birth of a star.

INT. BAXTER BUILDING - KITCHEN - MORNING

Sue stands alone, sifting through piles of mail.  She focuses

on one piece of mail that she's holding.  Her hand begins to

disappear and then the envelope slowly begins to disappear as

well.  Sue smiles at the success.  Intrigued.  Quiet:

Reed enters -- overworked, unshaved.  He keeps his head down,

preoccupied.  Sue shifts focus.

She puts the letters down, steps closer to Reed.

She considers.  Victor's words echo in her head.

Reed looks up, a little surprised.  He opens his mouth, but --

INT. BAXTER BUILDING - MEDIA ROOM - DAY

CRASH!  BANG!  Ben stalks around the room, furious.  Reed and

Sue rush in.

Ben points to the wall-sized TV: the ESPN MOTO X GAMES.

REVEAL: JOHNNY standing next to an X GAMES REPORTER.  He is

peeling off the burned remains of his motocross outfit,

revealing his FF UNIFORM, with a "4" STITCHED ONTO THE CHEST.

Behind them, STEP UP RIDERS launch their MOTO-BIKES off huge

18' high mountains of dirt, thirty feet in the air.

Ben, Sue, and Reed stare at the wall-sized TV.  Mouths agape.

She turns to Reed, who gives a sheepish shrug, and peels back

his labcoat revealing a "4" stitched onto his chest too.

Johnny hadn't really thought about them.  He spitballs:

Reed shrugs.  He doesn't hate the name.

Case in point: a photo of Ben fills the TV.

Johnny smiles, looking right into camera.

A LAUGH from the studio audience.

He turns to go.  Reed wraps an arm around Ben.

He sees a photo of himself on screen.

They put up a shot of Susan.

EXT. NYC ARENA - DAY

The Thing rounds the corner.  Sees a crowd of girls lined up

near a red PORSCHE parked out front...with "TORCHED" on the

plates.  Ben slows down, smiles.

EXT. NYC ARENA - A LITTLE LATER

Johnny and the Hot Babe exit, signing autographs for girls in

the line.  Sue and Reed approach, glare like angry parents.

Johnny finds the Valet, who looks ill...his car is gone.

The Valet blows his whistle...and a 4 X 4 solid cube of RED

JUNK METAL slides down the street and stops at the curb in

front of Johnny.  The Valet timidly holds out the keys...

Before he can finish, Johnny gets PELTED IN THE HEAD with the

license plate.  It rattles to the ground, face up.

Johnny rubs the sting out of his head.  Looks up and sees Ben

in the distance, dusting off his hands.

Ben marches up.  Hands balled into fists.

Ben reels back a FIST the size of an anvil.  Stops himself.

Instead of attacking, he starts to walk off.

Johnny hurls a FIREBALL that SMACKS Ben in the back of the

head.  Ben stops.  Turns around more shocked than hurt.

Ben gets hit with ANOTHER FIREBALL.  This time in the face.

Ben charges like a bull, fist cocked back, and...Reed steps

in the way!  Too late!  WHAMM!  Ben's fist PUNCHES INTO

REED'S CHEST, which INDENTS.  Reed's BACK EXPANDS with Ben's

fist, PUNCHING into Johnny, launching Johnny off his feet.

BAM!  Johnny SLAMS into a moving ADVERTISING TRUCK, with a

BURGER KING flame-broiled WHOPPER on the side.  WHOOSH!  He

leaves a flaming imprint on the all-beef patty.

The crowd stands stunned.  So do Reed and Sue.  Cameras pop.

Johnny slowly pulls himself up.  The paint on the truck

begins to bubble around his hand.  Beaten, bruised, he

stands.  Heating up.  Both his hands are now flaming fists of

fury.

He and Ben lock eyes, with a block of sidewalk between them.

High Noon.  They start to RUN toward each other...

When they are almost within range, Sue STEPS BETWEEN THEM,

stops them both in their tracks with just a look.  Like a

mom:

Ben just stalks off.  The crowd clears, scared.  A PAPARAZZI

snaps a picture.  Ben GRABS his camera, and flicks the lens.

EXT. STREETS - DAY

Sue looks at Johnny, more disappointed than angry.

She goes after Ben, leaving Reed and Johnny on the sidewalk.

Johnny nods, totally missing the sarcasm.

Reed looks at him, disgusted.  Johnny waves to the crowd,

hand flaming.  People SHRIEK, snap pictures.  Johnny smiles at

Reed.

Johnny steps into the sea of fans.  Reed stands alone.

EXT. STREET/ALLEY - DAY

Sue wades through the throng of New Yorkers.  Tries to catch

up with Ben...whose presence parts the crowd like Moses.

Ben glances sideways at her, doesn't stop.  She catches up.

He slows down, gets closer, intense.

She opens her mouth, but has no response.  She doesn't know

his depth of pain.  As he disappears into the alley, we CUT

TO --

INT. INVESTMENT BANK - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

The news plays on the TV.  Head Banker Ned Cecil freezes the

screen on an image of...THE THING.  He turns to Victor, who

sits with the rest of the bankers.  Cold, sterile

environment.

Victor has a larger bandage on his face now.

A cold, silent beat.  Victor leans forward.

He motions to his men.  They all stand.  Victor is the lone

man sitting.  PUSH IN on Victor's face, his inner rage

palpable.  A few quick surges of electricity emanate from his

body.  This man is getting stronger, more electric.

INT. BANK - UNDERGROUND PARKING GARAGE - DAY

After hours.  The floor is slick with water -- puddles in

every direction.  Ned Cecil comes out of the elevator,

heading for his car.  As he goes, the structure lights start

to flicker.  Ned looks up, watches the lights go out one by

one, furthest to closest.  He looks around.  Unnerved by the

darkness.

A hanging beat.  Victor steps out from shadows.

Victor says nothing.  Ned keeps going.

He mispronounces Latveria, dripping condescension.

That does it.  A surge of electricity courses through Victor.

His eyes narrow, and the electricity crackles down his leg to

THE GROUND.  The electric spark hits the water and...

ELECTRIC CURRENTS RACE ACROSS THE GROUND, SLITHERING

LIGHTNING-FAST ACROSS THE WATER (like deadly electric

snakes), heading straight for Ned.  His eyes go wide.  And...

NED IS ELECTROCUTED!  His body spasms.  THUD!  He slumps,

dead.  Smoke rises from his body.  Victor stands, power

swelling.

For the first time, his SCAR SPLITS OPEN, revealing a METAL

GLOW beneath the skin.  He remains scary calm.

Victor walks away, the final lights going to DARKNESS.

INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - DAY

Victor enters, still adrenalized.  He turns to the light

switch, and the lights come on.  He approaches his screens,

and the monitors flicker to life.  His powers are growing.

One MONITOR rolls the news.  IMAGES of the FANTASTIC FOUR.

Victor leans closer, and the VOLUME automatically goes up.

An IMAGE of VICTOR on screen.

Victor turns away from the screen.  The volume goes down.  He

focuses his eyes on REED.

Leonard enters, stepping closer, seeing the faint flicker of

VICTOR'S METALLIC SCAR.  His eyes narrow, concerned.

Victor keeps his eyes on the screen, totally engrossed.

He leans ever closer, so the static starts to swallow Reed.

A hard, deadly beat.  Victor's eyes narrow, zooming

into...REED'S RESEARCH: SLIDES on the wall.  He zooms into

key words:

DANGER, UNSTABLE IONS, MUTATION, OVERLOAD.  And Victor gives

a slow, thin smile.  A new plan forming.

His fist clenches.  We hear METALLIC SFX.

INT. BAXTER BUILDING - TRANSFORMATION LAB - DAY

Reed enters the room carrying a stack of boxes that no normal

man could balance.  But he is not normal.  His arms are

wrapped around the boxes five times over -- like human twine.

He stops short, and drops the boxes when he sees...

VICTOR overseeing a group of TECHNICIANS.  They are boxing up

Reed's work -- all of his equipment, research.  Victor wears

a bandage, covering his scar.  Reed eyes a glint of METAL.

Victor turns away.

Reed looks around, seeing his lab turned inside out.

Reed reaches out, grabbing a folder from a box.

Reed shakes his head, defending himself.

Victor pulls the folder from Reed's hand, and whips out the

intricate DIAGRAM of the MACHINE.  He points to parts:

Reed is a little surprised that Victor is so familiar with

his machine.  He points to a SECURE CHAMBER on the blueprint.

Victor slows.  Is Reed getting to him?  Or giving him ideas?

Victor considers.  He seems to enjoy watching Reed dangle.

Victor walks out.  Reed looks unsure, as we CUT TO --

INT. BAXTER BUILDING TRANSFORMATION LAB - DAY

The SHIELDS slowly rise.  FIVE TECHNICIANS go to work.  They

wear the VDI jackets.  Reed watches, worried.

Sue enters.  She sees the shields, the technicians, the VDI

logo.  And she is deeply worried.  She steps over to Reed.

Sparks fly behind them.  Drills scream.

INT. BAXTER BUILDING - REED'S OFFICE - DAY

Sue steps into the office, followed by Reed.  Quiet, urgent:

Reed starts to snap, losing his studied cool.

Sue stands there, shocked by his outburst.  A beat.

He looks at her, knowing what she means.  Where she means.

EXT. BROOKLYN STREETS - DAY

Ben nearly knocks people over as he stomps down the street,

mind tossing and turning.  People stare, point.  A LITTLE

GIRL and FRIEND run up to him.

She gestures to a tree next to Ben.  Looks up.

Ben rolls his eyes.  Looks up.  Considers climbing the tree,

but thinks better of it.  He has another idea...

Ben grabs the tree with one hand, and starts shaking the crap

out of it.  MEEEEEEOOOOOOOWWWWRRRRRRR!!!!

The cat falls into frame.  At the last instant, Ben sticks

out his hand and the cat lands safely in his palm.  He hands

the cat to the girl.  Barely acknowledges her profuse thanks.

He just moves on.

EXT. ANOTHER BROOKLYN STREET - NIGHT

Ben passes a window in a gallery, and almost misses A LARGE

SCULPTURE of his bust.

He stops, steps back to take a look.  It's exquisitely

rendered, capturing not just brute physicality, but the

haunting anguish in his eyes.  Ben is amazed, and touched,

but...

A beat.  He stares at these images of himself.

He turns to see...ALICIA in the doorway.

He steps toward her.  But he sees...a PARTY in the back part

of the gallery.  Ben pauses, a little insecure.

She smiles, a thought forming, as we CUT TO --

INT. GALLERY - STUDIO - NIGHT

WHOOSH!  A SCULPTOR'S HOSE sprays a thin stream of water at

BEN.  Alicia cleans Ben with her hands, using thin CARVING

CHISELS for his cracks.  Intricate, intimate work.

Ben enjoys every moment.  He eyes a couple, large PUPPETS in

the corner.

She gets closer, running her hands across his arm.

Ben bristles.  He doesn't want to stay this way.

As he ponders that, we hear a CROWD SWELLING on the CUT TO --

EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Fans swarm JOHNNY.  He signs autographs, poses for pictures.

Then his eyes move to...an incredibly long stretch LIMO.  A

tinted window rolls down.  Victor's face emerges.

EXT./INT. LIMO - NIGHT

Johnny climbs in, sees...three impossibly gorgeous MODELS.

He smiles, sitting down in the middle of them.

Johnny eyes the models, all lusting.

Victor nods, knowing he has Johnny on the hook.

Victor subtly nods to the models.  They envelop Johnny.

The car stops.  Victor gets out.  He stands on the pavement.

As he shuts the door, we see the women climbing onto Johnny.

The door shuts, and...

WHHHMMMPF!  The windows all suddenly STEAM UP!

INT. HAYDEN PLANETARIUM - NIGHT

STARS on the ceiling.  A VOICE drones about the galaxy.  In

the LAST ROW, we find: Reed and Sue.  Reed is thinking about

work.

He slowly looks up.  The stars seem to calm him.

Reed smiles softly, thinking back.

They laugh.  Sue looks up to the stars.  Quiet:

Reed looks at her.  Wrestles with a decision.  Then quietly:

She knows.  He trails off.  Sue looks at him.

Someone SHUSHES them.  They slump down further.  Closer.

Their eyes lock.  A heated beat.  No more secrets.  Their

faces are close.  A kiss is coming.  Closer, closer.  Sue

disappears.

Reed tentatively leans into the kiss, and...

Reed's face is SQUEEZED on both sides by Sue's invisible

hands.  She pulls him into a KISS.  Lips touch.  Soft,

tender.  Stars twinkle.  And we slowly DISSOLVE TO --

EXT. KIRBY GALLERY - NIGHT

Ben and Alicia step out together.  The crowd quiets, turns.

A few whispers flutter.  Alicia leans close to Ben, and slips

her arm into his.  The party goes back to normal.

She walks off.  He watches her go.  The way her hair moves.

The lines of her neck.  The light on her skin.  This woman is

the most beautiful thing Ben has ever seen.  He's falling

hard.

Ben steps through the crowd.  The swanky guests give strained

smiles, polite.  Ben is starting to feel comfortable here.

He keeps his eyes on Alicia, who talks to guests.

Ben hangs back, happy to watch her.  A few patrons pass him,

thinking he's just an inanimate statue.

Ben keeps his eyes on Alicia.  He overhears two BOHEMIAN

GIRLS, who assume he's a statue.

Ben just stands there, frozen.  His eyes dart around the

room, paranoid now.  Aware of people staring, laughing.  He

glances at Alicia, who giggles at something else.  Ten

seconds ago, this would have been dreamy.  Now it's damning.

We stay with Alicia, who cuts through the crowd, emerging

where she left Ben.  She has a PITCHER of wine in hand for

him.  But Ben is gone.  She looks disappointed, hearing his

heavy FOOTSTEPS get softer and softer in the distance.

THUNDER booms on the CUT TO --

EXT./INT. DINER - NIGHT

A pitstop in Queens.  Heavy RAIN swims down windows.  BEN

sits at the COUNTER, with his hat pulled low, coat tight.

Nobody sits within four chairs of him.  He sips coffee in a

metal bowl.  A long beat.  Then...

Ben turns to see...VICTOR.

Ben considers.  A man deeply alone.  A beat.

INT. DINER - LATER

Victor and Ben sit in a window booth.  A waitress sets a

foothigh stack of pancakes in front of Ben, removes huge

plates he's just cleared.  Victor's aware of the other

customers in the diner staring at Ben.  Ben burps: it rattles

the plates.

The Thing shoves a huge piece of pie in his mouth.

Ben doesn't trust him.  But Victor is hitting pressure

points.

Off The Thing: a seed of doubt has been planted.  He can't

help but find truth in the words.  And we CUT TO --

INT. BAXTER BUILDING - TRANSFORMATION LAB - NIGHT

Reed and Sue return, laughing quietly, bodies close.  Reed

turns on the lights, and they flinch when they see...BEN.  He

sits waiting, scowling.  They stop laughing immediately.

The construction of the TRANSFORMATION CHAMBER is complete.

The Technicians are gone now.

He motions to Reed and Sue together.

Sue looks a little hurt.

He POKES his finger into Reed's chest, which INDENTS around

it like the Pillsbury Doughboy.  Ben pushes Reed back.  Hard.

He grabs Reed's face, his fingers INDENTING the skin.  He

THROWS Reed back.  Reed slams down to the ground.

Ben shakes his head, looking down at Reed.

Reed tries to stand, but Ben KNOCKS him back.  Reed slams

into the wall, and stays down this time.

She starts to raise her hands to throw force-fields.

As Ben turns to her, Reed takes this opportunity to WRAP Ben

up like a python.  They struggle.  Ben runs back into a wall

to shake Reed.  Their faces are close, heated.

Ben seems to relax and Reed lets go.  Ben walks out.  Sue

comes to Reed's side.  He's bleeding.

She heads out.  Reed slowly stands.  He looks at the

transformation machine.  It's not ready.  But...Reed steps

toward it.  As he walks, his image goes grainy in --

INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Victor gets closer to his screens, watching Reed's every

step.  This is what Victor has been waiting for.  His screens

flicker with static -- he's too close, but he can't pull

back.  He sees: REED TURNS ON THE MACHINE.  Hits a countdown.

And he grabs his UNIFORM...

INT. BAXTER BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Sue hustles down the long hall.  Ben turns a corner, passing

the elevators, heading toward a FREIGHT ELEVATOR.  She gets

there too late.  Doors close, going down.

INT. BAXTER BUILDING - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT

Ben pounds across the lobby.  He sees Johnny coming in.

He holds up an ACTION FIGURE of BEN: a horribly bloated body

topped by a tiny pinhead.  Johnny pushes a button and --

WITH ONE ARM, Ben shoves Johnny into a wall.  With his other

hand, Ben grabs the toy and SMASHES it into the wall, inches

from Johnny's head.  The toy lodges into the plaster.

He strides away.

INT. BAXTER BUILDING - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT

DING.  Sue speeds out of the elevator.  No sign of Ben.  She

runs into...JOHNNY who shakes off the encounter.

This hits home.  Sue is quiet.  Johnny turns to go.

He pulls away from her, taking a step out the door.

He strides into the night, leaving Sue alone.  A dark night.

The Fantastic Four is no more.  The family is split apart.

INT. BAXTER BUILDING - TRANSFORMATION LAB - NIGHT

The transformation chamber is up and running.  Numbers count

down.  The storm swirls in the chamber.  Reed now wears the

UNIFORM.  He opens the door:

HE'S GOING TO USE IT ON HIMSELF.  HE IS FINALLY TAKING

ACTION.

INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Victor sits enthralled.  He leans forward, breathless.

INT. BAXTER BUILDING - TRANSFORMATION LAB - NIGHT

Reed gets closer.  His heart races.  So does Victor's.  A

moment of truth for both of them.  REED STEPS INTO THE

MACHINE.

Reed looks up at the cosmic storm.  He opens his arms, ready

to risk his life.  And...WHHHM!  He JOLTS in JUMP-CUT-MOTION,

RECONFIGURING, JERKING out of control, and we CUT TO --

VICTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

His screens GO BLACK.  He looks out the window to see...a

flash atop the BAXTER BUILDING.  The tip of the Baxter glows.

The rest of its lights GO OUT, FLICKERING in a power surge.

INT. BAXTER BUILDING - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT

Lights go haywire.  Sue knows immediately...

INT. BAXTER BUILDING - TRANSFORMATION LAB - NIGHT

Lights flicker in darkness.  The door rips open.  Sue lunges

inside.  She sees through smoke and sparks...REED sways in

the chamber.  A beat.  Did it work?  Then...

Reed SLUMPS TO THE GROUND.  His eyes flutter back.  Dead...?

His body is warped, twisted -- one half remains tense, hard,

while the other half is loose, soft, almost melted.

INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Victor watches every second on his monitors.

INT. BAXTER BUILDING - TRANSFORMATION LAB - NIGHT

Sue struggles to lift Reed -- half of his body is STRETCHED

OUT, devoid of any semblance of bone structure.  One side of

his face looks like it's MELTING OFF.

Reed loses consciousness.  Sue carries him out.

INT. VICTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Victor watches, his eyes narrow, looking at his hands.

He reaches out for his phone, and...his SPEAKERPHONE

AUTOMATICALLY TURNS ON.  His powers growing.

EXT. UNDER THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE - NIGHT

Ben sits alone, looking at city lights.  A man without a

home.  Without a family.  A hard beat.  HEADLIGHTS slash

across Ben.  He slowly turns, blinded in the lights of...a

LIMO.

Ben considers.  Despite it all, he's a good friend.  And a

good man.  As he gets into the car, we hear THROBBING MUSIC

IN --

INT. MANHATTAN NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

LOUD MUSIC and PULSATING LIGHTS.  A young crowd dances and

grinds to the beat.  Among the colorful lights, STREAKS OF

FLAME swirl around the ceiling.  We follow them to:

A BALCONY, where we see JOHNNY sitting in a cozy VIP section.

He's surrounded by "groupies" climbing over each other to get

a look at his various parlour tricks.

He leans closer to a YOUNG WOMAN.  Closer.  Candles around

them start to melt.  Beads of sweat drip down her face.

She pauses.  And...a very LARGE MAN steps up.

The Boyfriend doesn't look too happy.

Johnny does one more trick...taps the guy's drink...igniting

it into a burst of flame.  The Boyfriend drops the glass,

which SMASHES on the ground...catches the floor on fire.

The boyfriend quickly moves in and stamps it out.

The boyfriend takes his girlfriend's hand, they start to walk

off.  She turns back for one last comment...

Johnny looks a little embarrassed.  The couple leaves.

Johnny glances around.  His FANS look down, away.  He sees

how quickly they can turn.  The crowd parts slightly.  He

looks very alone.

INT. TRANSFORMATION CHAMBER - NIGHT

Leonard leads The Thing inside.  The ominous chamber sits

with its door open.  Victor enters from the control station.

Ben looks at the flickering lights.  Suspicious.  Victor

turns to Leonard, who looks a little scared by this dark

room.

Leonard nods, all too eager to get the hell out of here.

Leonard disappears fast, as Victor turns back to Ben.

Ben shakes his head, wanting to believe, but...

Ben nods.  Reed was wrong before.  Ben gets closer to the

machine, drawn to it.  He wants to believe, so badly.

Victor stands in shadows, but we see the tiniest little SPARK

around him.  The lights...?  Or his skin...?

He keeps his arm behind his back -- his fingertips course

with ELECTRICITY.  It starts to build, sparking up his arm.

Ben keeps his eyes on the machine.  His dream is alive.

INT. TRANSFORMATION CHAMBER - NIGHT

The chamber doors open.  Thing enters.  He looks around this

sterile box.  An animal in a cage.  Victor pushes a control;

the doors of the chamber slowly close and seal.  Thing shuts

his eyes.  He just wants to be Ben again.

FROM THE CONTROLS: Victor initiates the transformation

sequence.  As lights go on inside the chamber, they dim in

the lab.  Energy pumps into the chamber.  The storm swirls

faster.  Lights flicker...there's not enough power, until --

-- Victor walks over...grabs hold of the machine with both

hands...and WHHHM!  A countdown begins in the control panels.

SLOW MOVE IN on the chamber, The Thing's face in the window.

The chamber activates.  The storm strikes hard.

The Thing opens his mouth, a beat, then he screams in agony.

Struggling violently inside.  To escape?  Extend the moment:

Condensation obscures the chamber window: The Thing vanishes.

EXT. MANHATTAN SKYLINE - NIGHT

The city lights fill the sky, and give it a quiet, eerie

glow.  Suddenly, a BRIGHT FLASH emerges from the window of

the Baxter Building.  The rest of the city lights dim

slightly.

INT. BAXTER BUILDING LIVING QUARTERS - NIGHT

Reed lies in bed, weak, recuperating.  When the power surges,

we MOVE in on him: he looks up in alarm, knowing that

someone's using the chamber.  He starts to get out of bed,

straining to stand with every muscle left in his body.

INT. BAXTER BUILDING - MEDICAL SUPPLY ROOM - SAME TIME

Sue sifts through a cabinet full of medications.  The lights

dim.  Power failure.  She looks up...

EXT. CLUB - NIGHT

Johnny walks alone.  A WAVE OF LIGHT spreads through the sky.

He looks up.  His eyes adjust to the blast, as he realizes

where it's coming from.  He starts RUNNING toward the Baxter.

INT. BAXTER BUILDING - REVERSION LAB - NIGHT

INSIDE THE MACHINE, the RED CLOUD swirls with debris,

crackling with light.  The chamber rattles dangerously, as

the power seems to SHAKE the very foundation of the building.

And then it's over.  The light dies down...somewhat.  It

still pulses along with the chamber.  The chamber door SLIDES

OPEN.

Beat.  And...BEN GRIMM steps out.  Not The Thing.  No more

rocks.  BEN GRIMM.  Naked, tired, but finally A NORMAL MAN.

He slips on his trench-coat -- now way too large.  He

collapses.  He stares at his hands, his arms...it worked.

Ben sees a SPARK in shadows.  That spark is...

VICTOR'S ARM.  Victor steps forward, and reveals himself to

Ben: ELECTRICITY PUMPS THROUGH HIS BODY.  His skin is part

flesh, part metal.  Cheekbone exposed, steel tissue.

HE IS DOOM.

Ben starts to realize...

Doom smiles, reaches out his hand -- ELECTRICITY builds from

his shoulders, coursing down his arms to his fingertips.

DOOM smiles, nods, stronger than Ben now.

Doom clenches his fist and BLASTS Ben, sending him flying

backwards across the room -- knocked unconscious.

Suddenly, WHOOSH!  The lab door flies open.  Reed enters.

Doom steps back into the shadows.

Reed's eyes go wide.  He sees Ben crumpled in the corner.

Reed slowly turns to see...DOOM.  His body, his face.

Doom BLASTS an electrical BOLT at Reed, KNOCKING Reed through

the huge window!  Reed's body RUBBER-BANDS from the blast.

EXT. BAXTER BUILDING - NIGHT

Reed SLINKIES down the face of the building, skin rippling.

INT. BAXTER BUILDING - REVERSION LAB - NIGHT

Doom looks out the window, smiling at his old friend's fall.

INT. BAXTER BUILDING - FRONT LOBBY - NIGHT

DING!  The elevator opens.  Doom strides out.  He passes our

friend O'HOOLIHAN, who looks scared.

Doom casually SWIPES, sending him through revolving doors.

EXT. BAXTER BUILDING - NIGHT

Reed MELTS down the sides of an AWNING, like a Salvador Dali

watch.  He tries to GRAB HOLD of window ledges, but he can't

get a grip.  His ARM streeetches, and SNAP!  He falls like a

SLINKY, out of control.  Half his body loose, half hard.

He drips to the sidewalk, where...Doom steps out.  He catches

Reed's face, holds it close.

Doom whips Reed into the night.  As Doom turns, people cower,

horrified by his face.  They clear out, and...

Doom sees his REFLECTION in a window: scarred skin, metallic

veins.  A monster.  Infuriated, he SHATTERS the window with

an iron fist, and bounds into the night.

INT. BAXTER BUILDING - LATER - NIGHT

Smoke billows, windows are shattered.  Sue races inside,

seeing Doom's devastation.  Silence, deadly silence.

Then...she sees a pile of WRECKAGE shift.  BEN crawls out.

She helps him out of the rubble.  He is beaten, battered.

Johnny comes running in.  He sees the wreckage.

He nods.  A beat between them.  He looks around, sees Ben.

He motions to the wreckage.

Sue looks around.  Only one question.  Dead serious:

INT. VON DOOM - CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

Doom sits at the head of the table in an eerie parallel to

the opening scene.  Those mysterious CRATES loom in shadows.

He wears a green HOOD, and METAL MASK over his scarred face.

Doom's eyes turn toward...the other end of the table.

We now see what he sees: Reed sits in a chair with TUBES

INJECTED into his skin FREEZING HIM SOLID!  Ultra-cold vapor

coats him.  Doom steps closer, a sadistic smile.

Reed tries to move but can't even ball his hand into a fist.

He PRESSES DOWN on one of Reed's fingers, which makes a

horrific CRACKING SOUND.  Reed's face twists with pain.

Doom seems to enjoy every CRACK.  He leans closer.

Doom lets up on Reed and reaches into a crate, and pulls out

a military-issue ROCKET-LAUNCHER.  He aims at the city

skyline, locking onto his target: JOHNNY STORM.

Johnny's HEAT SIGNATURE glows.  The screen flashes: TARGET

ACQUIRED.  Doom looks back at Reed, his launcher aimed

casually over his shoulder.

BOOOOM!  He fires without looking!  A MISSILE blasts into the

sky.  THE MISSILE LIGHTS UP THE DARK NIGHT beginning its wide

turn towards its target.

INT. BAXTER BUILDING

Johnny, Ben, and Sue hear the missile being fired and turn to

the window -- it BANKS, coming STRAIGHT for them.  They move

to --

EXT. BAXTER BUILDING BALCONY - NIGHT

Johnny rushes toward the edge, to get a good look at the

missile streaking closer.  As he moves, the missile SHIFTS

slightly with HIS MOTION!  His eyes narrow, thinking.

He FLAMES ON a HAND.  He waves his flaming hand, and the

MISSILE locks onto the fire!  Johnny darkens, realizing...

His mind races.  He makes a decision, and steps up onto the

ledge, hundreds of feet above the street.

Johnny considers, a half-beat.  He looks out.  Under breath:

Sue reaches out to stop him, but Johnny DIVES HEROICALLY OFF

THE EDGE!  He FLAMES ON!  The missile follows his arc.  As he

drops, his clothes BURN OFF, revealing his UNIFORM.

He falls lower, lower.  And...he...BANKS!  SWOOPS UP!

FLYING!

Sue watches, with fear, and a hint of pride.

Sue shakes her head, sympathetic.

She heads off.  Ben watches her go, helpless.

INT. BAXTER BUILDING - REVERSION LAB - NIGHT

Ben steps back into this ravaged room.  Through the shattered

window, he sees Johnny's FLAMES streaking away.  A hard beat.

EXT. NEW YORK - NIGHT

Johnny zigs and zags, but the missile takes every twist and

turn, gaining on him, bearing down.  Cars slow, stop.  More

people look up, scared, pointing at this stunning sight.

INT. VON DOOM CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

Eerily silent.  Reed tries to move, but he is FROZEN.  He

hears a footstep.  But the room is EMPTY.  No sign of Doom

even.  A beat.  He hears a CREAK.  Another CREAK, closer.

And...

A FREEZING TUBE starts to SHIFT.  It goes taut, clearly being

manipulated by a hand -- an INVISIBLE HAND.  Sue APPEARS next

to Reed, tube in hand.  She tries to stay calm.

Reed's eyes shift to see...Doom emerge from the darkness.

He steps closer.  Electrodes course over his metal skin.

She hardens, a little force field starts to emanate from her.

Doom has a hand behind his back, generating an energy blast.

She HURLS a force-field at him.  It CONNECTS, KNOCKING him

back a half-step.  But he simply shakes it off, and steps up.

Too powerful.  He smiles.  His arms CRACKLE with electricity.

BOOM!  He FIRES an ELECTRIC SHOCKWAVE that LAUNCHES her back.

She spirals through the air, crashing into the wall, THUDDING

to the floor.  As Doom stalks closer, Sue gathers her

strength to...GO INVISIBLE.

A hanging beat.  We see: a FAINT OUTLINE of Sue behind him.

He SPINS, GRABS her!  Doom grips her neck, SLAMMING her to

the ground beside Reed.  She lays there, beaten, visible.

In the distance behind Doom, city lights BLINK, fading in and

out.  Lights flutter softly here (like when Ben went through

the machine).  Reed looks up.  Could it be...?

EXT. EAST RIVER - NIGHT

Johnny jets over the water with the missile only twenty feet

behind him.  He's running out of options, when he spots:

A GARBAGE BARGE floating in the water ahead.  Thinking fast,

Johnny does a fly-by and HURLS a fireball at the barge.

VWOOSH!  The flames ignite and spread quickly.

He loops back toward the flaming barge as the missile closes

in on him.  Fifteen feet...ten... Just as it's about to hit --

JOHNNY FLAMES OFF and falls toward the water.  As he tumbles

through the air, we CUT BACK TO --

INT. VON DOOM CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

From their vantage point, they see the missile explode.

Flames dance. Sue's eyes darken, as Doom grips her neck.

Reed tries desperately to move, but he is FROZEN.  It takes

every last ounce of strength to lift one finger, which makes

a CRACCCKKKKING sound.

Sue and Reed lock eyes.  Reed tries to move his mouth.  He

has something to tell her, struggling just to move his lips

and get the words out.

He starts to say "you," but his lips FREEZE, mid-word.  Sue

whispers to him:

Doom steps toward Sue, about to deliver the final blow.

BOOOOM!  An elevator DOOR FLIES INTO THE ROOM!  SMASH!

Reed recognizes the voice.  So do we.  Doom turns to see...

BEN GRIMM, AKA THE THING.  Back in rocky, fighting form.

Doom turns, just as --

BAM!  Ben HITS Doom harder than any living thing has ever

been hit.  The force sends Doom back through the air, toward

the far wall, where he SMASHES into the massive "V"

sculpture.  It SNAPS, crashing onto him.  A few sparks.  Then

nothing.

Nothing at all.  No more movement.  Doom is dead.

Ben turns to Reed.

Reed manages the thinnest smile as Ben starts disconnecting

the tubes from Reed.

WHMM!  The WRECKAGE shifts.  They turn to see...Doom EMERGES.

He stands, power coursing.  And he CHARGES at Ben!  Ben

charges back.  And these two behemoths...

SLAM INTO EACH OTHER, CRASHING THROUGH GLASS, INTO THIN AIR!!

EXT. VON DOOM BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

Doom and Ben PLUMMET, wrestling in mid-air.  On the ground,

PEOPLE scream and duck for cover.  Doom and Ben SMASH through

the large GLASS roof of a lower building across the street.

INT. HOTEL - INDOOR POOL - CONTINUOUS

BOOOOM!  Doom and Ben, locked in combat, drop through the

glass, landing in a large HOTEL POOL.  People scream, run.

INT. HOTEL - INDOOR POOL - NIGHT

UNDERWATER: Doom and Ben LAND HARD.  Their combined weight

CRACKS the floor of the pool.  A YOUNG BOY watches underwater

through his MASK.  Doom and Ben square off, but...

The CRACKS OPEN WIDER!  And they're PULLED toward the HOLE!

WHOOSH!  The water is all sucked out of the hole.  The boy

holds tight to a ladder, as Ben and Doom crash down to --

INT. HOTEL - HALLWAY - NIGHT

A HOTEL GUEST sees water FLOOD into the hall.  Roaring rapids

head straight for him.  He jams his key into the lock,

turning desperately, just barely leaping out of the way as

the wave carrying BEN and DOOM SMASHES through a window to --

EXT. HOTEL - CONTINUOUS

SMASH!  Ben and Doom fly out the window, thrashing in the

TEN THOUSAND-GALLON WATERFALL TO --

EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - CONTINUOUS

CRASH!  Water floods the street.  Doom and Ben land in a

large GARBAGE TRUCK.  The truck rocks back and forth, DENTING

from the inside.  Grunts, growls.

CRASH!  The truck suddenly STOPS.  COP CARS SPEED CLOSER,

sirens screaming.  And --

BOOM, A HUGE SHAPE explodes from the truck.  SMASH!  Ben

lands on a CAR filled with two OLD LADIES -- his head cracks

the WINDSHIELD.  Doom steps out of the garbage truck, water

flooding the street around him.  COP CARS converge on Doom.

Doom turns his attention to the cops.  His limbs SPARK with

electricity, ready to fire at the cars.

EXT./INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

Ben sees the cops and Doom.  He knows the cops are dead meat.

He turns to the OLD LADY in the driver's seat.

She nods and quickly gets out, shaking.

Ben LIFTS the car and THROWS it at Doom.  WHMM!  It FLIES

through the air, and WHAM!  Hits hard, knocking Doom back

twenty feet!  As Doom FLIES back, a BUS enters frame, and --

EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - NIGHT

BOOM!  Doom SMASHES into the OUT OF SERVICE BUS!  CRASH!

Windows shatter.  The bus SLAMS into an ELECTRICITY POLE,

snapping the pole.  Doom steps out, unharmed.

Ben CHARGES toward him.  Doom grabs the broken ELECTRICITY

POLE, FLIPS it into his hand, and wields the pole like a

giant STUN-GUN!  Electric sparks FLY through the air into --

BEN!  The BLAST of VOLTS launches him off his feet!  He goes

FLYING backward, ELECTROCUTED in mid-flight, and --

WHOOMPF!  Ben LANDS HARD, face down, CRATERING the street!

Water rushes into the crater.  Ben lays there, incapacitated.

EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - SAME TIME

On the street, cars SCREAM to stops, people GASP.  Doom

strides up to Ben, and raises the ELECTRICITY POLE for the

death-blow.  Currents surge.  Right before he swings down --

Simple, strong.  Doom turns to see...REED.  Alone.  Bruised

and battered.  Slowly stepping toward him.  Doom smiles.

He turns back to Ben, raises the pole, but...he CAN'T SWING

DOWN!  Something is HOLDING the pole in mid-air.

Something invisible.

She turns VISIBLE, holding back the pole with a FORCEFIELD.

Using her power, she FLINGS the pole from Doom's grip.  It

skids along the street.  Reed helps Ben to his feet.

Doom turns to these three wounded soldiers.

Doom steps toward them, but --

WHOOOSH!  Johnny SWOOPS DOWN, hurling a FIREBALL like a

flamethrower, KNOCKING Doom back.

Johnny takes his place alongside the others.  The four of

them stand as one.  Johnny turns to Thing.

Thing starts to retort, but Johnny gives a warm smile.

They turn to Doom, who stands with metal skin slightly singed

and melted, making him look all the more menacing.

Electricity starts to course through his body.  He stands at

the foot of the crater Ben made.  He THRUSTS down, grabbing a

thick POWER CABLE, RIPPING it out of the street!

He SNAPS the cable into two snaking, lashing strips.  He

holds tight, ABSORBING the power.  Lights FLICKER and DIM in

buildings around him.  Windows BLOW!  Doom GLOWS, amped up.

He LETS GO of the cables!  The two deadly wires SNAKE out of

control!  PEDESTRIANS scatter, panic.  Reed sees the wires

SLASHING through the air.  He makes a move:

Reed STREEETCHES HIS ARMS, reaching for the deadly cables.

Doom FIRES superpowered ENERGY BOLTS.  The electric charges

surge through the air toward the Fantastic Four, but --

Sue TOSSES her FORCE-FIELDS, exploding Doom's blasts in mid-

flight.  She keeps her hands up, BLOCKING blows like a prize

fighter.  One of Doom's BOLTS glances off her force-field

and --

SMASHES into a concrete stanchion of a BUILDING!  The pillar

starts to crumble, with PEOPLE huddled under the overhang!

They're about to be CRUSHED by the falling concrete!  But --

Suddenly, the concrete roof HOLDS STEADY...because...BEN is

holding it up!  He stands beside the stanchion, like Atlas

holding the world.  People run out, safe.

ON THE STREET: Reed finally grabs both ends of the wire.

Johnny FLIES toward him, and uses his flames to WELD the

wires back together.  Sparks fly.  The cables start to FUSE.

Doom keeps FIRING.  Sue struggles with her force-fields.  The

impact is too much.  Her nose starts to bleed.

Doom smiles.  Reed sees her.  She is about to drop her hands,

vulnerable, but..............REED STRETCHES HIS WHOLE BODY!

He EXPANDS himself across the street, and GRABS a TREE, so he

forms a WALL between Sue and Doom.

Doom keeps FIRING his bolts.  They SLAM into Reed's body,

RUBBERBAND his skin, and DISTEND OUT his back without

breaking.  He strains, agonizing.

Johnny charges toward Doom -- flames on his body starting

build to a blinding white intensity, ENGULFING everything.

Johnny GRABS DOOM.

FLASH!  Johnny explodes in a PULSE of BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT,

which starts to HEAT UP everything surrounding it.  Reed

doesn't miss a beat.  He's in total command now.

She concentrates.  She sees Johnny holding onto Doom -- and

the GROWING HEAT and LIGHT.

Sue shuts her eyes.  A GIANT FORCE FIELD EXPLODES FROM HER

BODY.  A massive WAVE OF ENERGY.  It SWOOPS past a car, which

WARPS, MELTS (half the car is not inside the force-field).

Thing turns to the crowd, extending his arm, blocking them.

Sue's force-field ENVELOPS JOHNNY'S SUPERNOVA, containing it

in a BRIGHT SPHERE OF ENERGY.  The light increases, to the

point that it's blinding.  People look away.

Finally, Johnny's supernova fades.  He collapses to the

ground, exhausted, smoking.  Sue exhales and falls to her

knees.  Her force field fades.  The light flickers out.  As

everyone's eyes adjust, we hear...THUD.  THUD.  And --

DOOM steps through the smoke.  Unharmed.  His metallic body

GLOWS WHITE, TRAILING MOLTEN METAL.  Sue, Ben, Johnny look

devastated.  They can't beat him.  He looks at Reed.

Reed stays perfectly calm.  He shakes his head.

He KICKS OPEN the FIRE HYDRANT.  The water GEYSERS UP!  Ben

kicks down with his foot, deflecting the water so it sprays

toward Reed, who...TWISTS HIS TORSO so...

The water CURLS around his chest, RACES down his arms, and

SHOOTS right off his wrists toward Doom!

Doom RUSHES TOWARD Reed, but the WATER FLIES OUT, DOUSING

DOOM.  GIANT CLOUDS OF STEAM fill the air from the cooling

metal.  DOOM screams.  His shrieks finally fade to SILENCE.

The water stops, thick steam clouds roll, completely

obscuring Doom from view.  A beat.  The steam clears to

reveal:

DOOM.  A true statue now -- a hard, cold solid piece of

METAL.  Frozen forever.  Reed, Sue, Ben, and Johnny -- The

Fantastic Four -- exhale.  They stand as one, in roiling

smoke.  A beat.

Reed and Sue slowly lock eyes, thinking the same thing.

Will they accept their mantle?  Reed shrugs.

They give weary smiles.  A team.  Sue gets close to Reed.

THHM!  He KISSES HER.  His neck extending.  Strong, powerful.

He pulls back slightly, smiles at her.  A new strength in

him.

Sue looks at Reed.  A long way from that conference room.

As they kiss, people emerge, stepping out of hiding.  The sun

rises around them.  The Fantastic Four step into the new dawn

of a new day.  And we slowly DISSOLVE TO --

INT. CIRCLE LINE BOAT - BANQUET ROOM - DUSK

Reed and Sue kiss on the deck of the Circle Line as it chugs

around New York City.

A PARTY IN PROGRESS.  Drinks, food, music.  We see in the

crowd a familiar faces: O'HOOLIHAN (cast on his arm),

bartender ERNIE, others.  JOHNNY and BEN stand behind Reed

and Sue.

Reed and Sue pull apart.  Reed turns to Ben, excited.

She hands Ben a big METAL MUG.  Ben takes the mug.  He

CLINKS, but SHATTERS her glass.

Alicia gets close.  A soft smile.  Reed turns to Sue.

Reed leads her out.  Ben and Johnny swap a glance.

EXT. CIRCLE LINE BOAT - DECK - DUSK

A romantic view of the city-scape.  Reed stands with Sue.

He opens his hand, revealing a circular piece of metal, just

about the size of......a RING.  Sue slows down.

She sees Johnny and Ben inside, watching -- in on a secret.

Reed looks her square in the eye.  Unflinching.

Reed drops to his knees.  His head stays eye-level, while his

body drops.  Sue gapes, so emotional she starts to DISAPPEAR.

Dead silence.  And then...

THE RING DISAPPEARS.  SUE IS WEARING IT.

Reed goes to kiss her.

Reed's face is SQUEEZED on both sides by Sue's invisible

hands.  She pulls him into a KISS and reappears.

INSIDE: the party applauds.  Ben, Johnny, and Alicia move

through the crowd to join Reed and Sue.  As they go --

Ben glares, fists clenched.  Johnny smiles, mischievous, as

they hit the balcony.  And he FLAMES ON, taking off into the

air, blazing the NUMBER "FOUR" enclosed in a circle of flame

(their future callsign), over the city skyline.  The crowd

oohs and aahs.  Ben watches, unimpressed.

People drink, laugh, dance.  We slowly PULL BACK from the

party, the boat, the city, and...CUT TO --

EXT. HARBOR - DAY

CLOSE ON: the MELTED FACE of DOOM.  He is placed in a wooden

crate.  LEONARD oversees the operation, listening to his

cell.

As two workers move the heavy door in place -- a crackle of

ELECTRICITY moves over Doom's body.  Leonard's CELLPHONE goes

STATICKY.  His eyes narrow.  Could it be...?  And --

SLAM.  The door closes.  We can read the destination through

stenciled lettering: LATVERIA.  And we pull back to reveal

the box is on the deck of:

A FREIGHTER SHIP.  The ship pulls away, steaming into the

horizon, as we...
