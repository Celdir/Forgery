FADE IN:

INT.  MIKE'S HOUSE - QUEENS - EARLY EVENING

Winter.  A celebration.  Close friends, cop friends,

family all here to celebrate patrolman MIKE KEEGAN'S

promotion to detective, NYPD.

The party spills through the house -- front room, dining

room, kitchen, with a small fenced backyard visible beyond

that.  A community of cops on their off-hours, their

wives, kids.  A mix of generations, all the way from

MIKE'S kid, TOMMY, and his FRIENDS, playing among the

adults, to an elderly woman observing quietly from her

chair at the side.  The mood's warm, spirited; there's a

lot of friendship here.

ANGLE:  MIKE, in the dining room, posing for a photo with

his ten-year-old son, TOMMY, proudly displaying his new

gold detective's SHIELD pinned to his jersey.

ANGLE:  ELLIE, MIKE'S wife of fifteen years, a local

product, bright and lively, and clearly proud as hell of

her man.  She frees herself from the crush of friends,

hurrying to join him.

ANGLE:  MIKE, ELLIE giving him a full-mouthed smack on the

lips as he hooks her into his arms.

The picture's snapped, to a chorus of hoots and hollers.

Behind, a banner and poster blowup of Mike in gun and

uniform read:  "FINALLY THEY'VE RECOGNIZED YOU, DETECTIVE

KEEGAN."

SCOTTY, a patrolman with the 117th and one of MIKE'S best

pals, puts his hand vigorously, in congratulations, on

MIKE'S SHOULDER.

BROOKLYN, a cop about Mike's age, joins in.

The ROOKIE stares, impressed.

ANGLE ON MIKE, trying to swallow a mouthful of potato

salad as a plump and pretty middle-aged woman (HELEN

GREENING) pulls him into a bear hug, planting a kiss on

him.

ANGLE ON T.J. GREENING, Helen's husband, Mike's best

friend.  He's forty, stocky, looks up, horsing around with

some of the kids in the next room.

ANGLE ON TOMMY:  in the hallway, trying to show SCOTTY'S

date -- a "real" BIMBO, who's spilling out of her woolly

sweater and tight jeans -- how to stand on his SKATEBOARD.

She shrieks a laugh, toppling off.  HELEN, passing by with

an empty platter, catches the action.

INT.  KITCHEN - SAME

ELLIE, another WIFE at the sink, wives all; HELEN enters.

ELLIE continues washing the dishes as HELEN and the WIFE

dry.  MIKE enters to get more beers.

He GRINS at their blank stares... ELLIE'S EYES wryly

following... as he moves on out with his beers.

INT.  MIKE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Night has descended, PEOPLE talking and laughing quietly,

MELLOW music is playing -- CAMERA FINDING MIKE AND ELLIE,

dancing close, moving sensually.  It's impressive.  HELEN

convinces T.J. to DANCE.  SCOTTY and BIMBO join in too.

T.J., whipped, extricates himself and Helen; tousling

Mike's hair in affection.

INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT

MIKE is holding TOMMY asleep on his shoulder.

ELLIE appears, completing the family portrait.

MIKE smiles and climbs the stairs.

INT.  MIKE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

ELLIE in the bathroom, the door open, she brushes her

hair.

MIKE in bed, thoughtful, a happy man.

MIKE waits for a response.  None comes.

She does -- the lights snap put.  They giggle, she MOVING

into his arms.

Another muted laugh -- and they move into an EMBRACE,

CAMERA PANNING WITH THEM, and then STILL FARTHER INTO THE

DARKNESS.

THE DARKNESS HOLDS.

EXT.  EAST RIVER - (AERIAL) - NIGHT

... Becoming a darkness pricked with light, as WE FLOAT

over the reflective river, MOVING WEST TOWARD AND OVER THE

CITY.

EXT.  MANHATTAN - (AERIAL CONTINUED) - NIGHT

The fabled city, the ultimate object of man's desire and

fulfillment, Oz, the city unfolding itself before and

beneath us, till DAZZLING SHAFTS OF LIGHT sizzling up --

KLEIG LIGHTS -- stab our eyes and bring us down into their

BLINDING BRIGHTNESS...

EXT.  CLUB - MIDTOWN - NIGHT

A nondescript piece of rundown city block that's the

hottest thing in town.  PERSONNEL regulate the CROWD and

ARRIVALS.  There is a public line, and from it the young,

hip and outrageous can look on while awaiting entrance at

the formally dressed, stylishly gowned GUESTS arriving at

the private line.

A glittering post-Metropolitan Museum of Art opening gala

is in progress tonight.  The club's private entrance looks

like what it once was, a shuttered porno bookstore, and

the joke's not lost on most of the formal GUESTS, arriving

through the X-rated doorway.

INT.  CLUB - NIGHT

The latest achievement of money, rock and art.  It's a

breathtaking multi-leveled theater of light, sound and

dance.

There is also an entrance-by-invitation-only grand salon.

ANGLE

The GUESTS arriving here for the Met gala enter almost in

enchanted procession, each of them being personally

greeted by the primary owner and manager of the club, WIN

HOCKINGS, a charming, rakish ex-preppy.  WIN stands in the

middle of the floor in the throw of a spot, greeting.

This is his element and his club, a son of old money, and

a crossover creature to the fast life.

CAMERA MOVING IN ON A NEW ANGLE, CLAIRE GREGORY and NEIL

STEINHART.  The way our CAMERA covers them makes it clear

they are major characters in our story.  NEIL steps

forward to introduce himself, but WIN, looking up, spots

CLAIRE first:  A special beauty and clearly someone very

special to him...

And he embraces her.

He grins broadly, taking NEIL'S hand; then right back to

CLAIRE.

WIN acknowledges the obligatory compliment with a closed

smile, impatiently returning to CLAIRE:

NEIL stares, polite, as WIN whisks her away; turning, as

he is addressed by someone else coming his way.

EXT.  THE CLUB - NIGHT

as a BLACK PORSCHE PULLS UP, its dark-tinted window

rolling down TO REVEAL JOEY VENZA.  The MANAGER of the

club comes over to him, with a clipboard list of only the

invitees.

VENZA jams the ACCELERATOR to the FLOOR, the CAR burning

rubber like a DRAGSTER as PEOPLE SQUEAL and JUMP OUT of

the way; the CAR fish-tailing away, screeching AROUND the

CORNER.

INT.  CLUB - NIGHT

WIN and CLAIRE.  The music, noise, other conversations can

still be heard as they walk through the club.

He smiles, mid-conversation; there's a real affection

here.

INT.  BASEMENT - REAR - ENTRANCE - NIGHT

VENZA entering, a rush, NOISE and ACTIVITY from the alley

outside; the throbbing new MUSIC overhead.

JOEY VENZA

Immaculate as always, in a conservatively-cut European

pinstripe, VENZA strides tautly into the shabby corridors.

INT.  MEZZANINE - MAIN BAR - NIGHT

WIN shows CLAIRE the main dance floor below, sound-filled

and crowded, private and paying GUESTS mixing,

indistinguishable now.  He raises his voice to be heard.

He turns and takes her arm.

He leads her to the freight elevator.

A sociable FOURSOME descends on them.  It looks like it's

going to be a long conversation.

He turns as she's engulfed, heading towards the elevator,

runs into NEIL, CLAIRE'S escort.  NEIL doesn't see her.

He smiles, entering the elevator and disappearing from

view.  NEIL looking around, with thinly-veiled impatience,

at the benefit-types streaming into the room.

INT.  BASEMENT TUNNELS - NIGHT

VENZA navigates the labyrinth that connects to the

offices.

INT.  BASEMENT - NIGHT

The elevator reaches bottom.  WIN exits into an area of

tall rows of stacked boxes still awaiting unloading.

Beyond, a bright, high-ceilinged linen whiteness gleams.

It's a soon-to-be restaurant-gallery area.

THE RESTAURANT GALLERY

The walls have already been painted white.  Tables have

been positioned.  Chairs are stacked, waiting.  So are

mounds of folded laundry and tablecloths, boxes of

accessories, glass and dish and kitchenware, etc.

Except for FRED, the elderly stock boy, the bright silence

is empty.

FRED scores open the sealed cardboard cartons with a

curved case cutter.  Several tablefuls of unloaded

servers, kitchen utensils, etc., bear witness to the size

of his job.

FRED nods, putting down his case cutter, using a side

exit.

WIN, left alone, turns to look up proudly at his

powerhouse modern art collection lining the wall.

INT.  MEZZANINE - NEAR ELEVATOR - NIGHT

CLAIRE extricating herself; to the foursome.

She smiles graciously and steps into the freight elevator,

pushing the down button.  The doors close.

INT.  BASEMENT TUNNELS - NIGHT

VENZA approaches an intersection.  Ahead, FRED crosses on

his way to the offices.  The elderly STOCK BOY doesn't see

VENZA, but VENZA sees him, realizing where else to look

here.

INT.  FREIGHT ELEVATOR - NIGHT

CLAIRE closes her eyes, leaning back against the metal

walls, taking advantage of the refuge for the moment.

Music and crowd noise still vibrate.  The elevator,

shuddering, continues its descent.

INT.  RESTAURANT - NIGHT

WIN turns in the silence, looking out over the bright

space edged by darkness, every reason to be pleased.

WIN doesn't even hear VENZA enter.

WIN turns.

INT.  ELEVATOR - BASEMENT - NIGHT

The elevator arrives.  The doors open.  CLAIRE steps out

into the shadowed area of stacked rows.

INT.  RESTAURANT - WIN AND VENZA

WIN turn away from VENZA.  VENZA grabs his arm violently.

VENZA

slashes one of the canvases (A Rosenquist) with the case

cutter... Then another...

ANGLE - WIN

ANGLE

Venza slashes another.

VENZA

turns, slashing WIN.

WIN

gasps.  Blood begins to seep from his wound.

ANGLE - CLAIRE

hearing, emerges into the light, smiling, thinking WIN'S

saying something she's supposed to respond to.

VENZA

slashing WIN again, losing all control.

CLAIRE ROUNDS THE CORNER

Seeing WIN, she stops.

ANGLE

VENZA continues to attack him, stabbing WIN to the floor.

CLAIRE

screams, unable to imagine or believe it.

VENZA

looks up, hearing her.

WIN sprawls, a lifeless, bloodied mass at VENZA'S feet.

VENZA stares, returning CLAIRE'S stare, trying to

concentrate, to focus and pull himself back together.  He

puts down the cutter, taking a step toward her.

CLAIRE

steps back, turning and moving back toward the elevator,

running.

VENZA

quickens his step, after her.

ANGLE ON THE ELEVATOR

as she REACHES IT and HURTLES inward, HITTING all the

BUTTONS, the doors beginning to RUMBLE CLOSED.  But VENZA

is there, THRUSTING HIS HAND INSIDE to stop them.  The

doors CLOSE on his fingers.  He cries out, pulling his

fingers free.  He slams his fist against the doors as they

close shut, POUNDS the button again.

ANGLE INSIDE - CLAIRE

But CLAIRE grabs the POWER SWITCH, pulling it -- the

elevator goes dead, the overhead lights go out -- and

somewhere, in the shaft above, an ALARM BELL begins to

RING.

Relentlessly, VENZA pounds on the other side of the door.

CLOSE ON CLAIRE

giving way in the darkened cubicle.

ANOTHER ANGLE - CLAIRE

sagging against the elevator wall, weeping, hearing

VENZA'S FRANTIC BREATHING on the other side subside, and

finally move away in the darkness.

INT.  MIKE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

The PHONE RINGING -- a hand fumbling on the telephone in

the darkness.  WE HEAR MIKE'S VOICE as he turns on the

light.

MIKE hanging up the phone, turns to ELLIE.

INT.  UNMARKED CAR - NIGHT

MIKE and T.J. disheveled and tired, drinking out of

styrofoam coffee cups, arriving at the club.

INT.  THE CLUB - NIGHT

A rare tableau; swirling disco lights reflecting off

strategically placed mirrors, illuminating a room filled

with POLICEMEN (in uniforms and polyester suits), trying

to ride herd on the BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE, in contrasting

attire.

The man in charge and coping is LIEUTENANT GARBER; in

plainclothes, fiftyish, rough-hewn.

T.J. and MIKE arrive.

T.J. reacts to the name.

A massive "GASP" goes up from the CROWD as a cumbersome

BODYBAG is brought up a stairwell from downstairs.  GARBER

temporarily moves away to oversee.

T.J. moves into action with typical "T.J. style"

diplomacy.

The uniformed COPS take their cue, moving in for quiet.

EXT.  WIN HOCKINGS' OFFICE - CLUB - NIGHT

A uniformed COP guarding the door as MIKE approaches,

flashing his shield.

INT.  WIN HOCKINGS' OFFICE - NIGHT

The room is dim, lit only by a desk lamp, CLAIRE seated on

a couch, catatonic, NEIL kneading her hand, trying to

comfort her.  A KNOCK at the DOOR:  NEIL JUMPS UP to open

it -- MIKE ENTERING before he gets there.

MIKE gets his first view of her as she TURNS her head into

the light.  It is an almost storybook vision of beauty

that emerges from the darkness around her; her

vulnerability penetrates to the very core.

ANGLE ON MIKE AND NEIL:  at a standoff.

MIKE OPENS THE DOOR for NEIL.  NEIL reluctantly swallows

it.

NEIL grudgingly leaves.  MIKE quietly closes the door.

ANGLE CHANGE:  CLAIRE and MIKE alone.  He sits down.  A

beat.

Her plaintive eyes turning to meet his.

She lifts her gaze quizzically, catching his smile.  She

returns it in spite of herself, disarmed by his frankness,

and curiously reassured.

INT.  DOWNTOWN HEADQUARTERS - DAY

PHONES RINGING, TYPEWRITERS TYPING, BODIES moving at

cross-current -- CAMERA FINDING LIEUTENANT GARBER,

hustling through the bullpen, MIKE FOLLOWING, toward his

office.

T.J. has joined them.

GARBER turns back to MIKE

He MOVES ON, leaving them not very happy.

GARBER turns back.

GARBER MOVES ON OUT.  MIKE and T.J. left alone.

EXT.  BACK OF MIKE'S HOUSE - DAY

ELLIE IS SEEN unloading groceries from the rear of a small

hatchback...

INT.  MIKE'S HOUSE - DAY

MIKE is in the kitchen; he's making eggs in agitation,

throwing in everything he can find (tuna fish, chopped

pickles, mustard), his kid, TOMMY, in evidence in the

b.g., on a SKATEBOARD, whizzing through the kitchen, even

RIDING IT down the STAIRS.

MIKE MOVES TO A CABINET -- and his FEET GO OUT FROM UNDER

HIM.  He's slipped on a SKATEBOARD -- barely catching

himself in time.

TOMMY whizzes through, expertly picking it up "on the

move," MIKE taking a futile swipe at him.

TOMMY goes whizzing on out again.  ELLIE comes in loaded

up with the groceries.  Puts them down, giving MIKE a

kiss.

It explains his mood.  ELLIE starts putting away the

groceries.

CLOSE ON ELLIE:  she sits, realizing, upset, but taking it

in stride, now putting plates on the table.

TOMMY enters.

ELLIE makes an expression of dislike.

TOMMY joins then at the table.

Silence; they eat... ELLIE'S eyes finding MIKE'S.

TOMMY'S face screws up, tasting the lump of food in his

mouth.

EXT.  MANHATTAN - FIFTH AVENUE - EARLY EVENING

Mike emerges from the subway alongside the park.

EXT.  FIFTH AVENUE APARTMENT BUILDINGS - EARLY EVENING

Out front, the DOORMAN opens the door for the building's

children returning from music lessons.

Across the street in Central Park, handsome, elderly

tenants stroll in the company of their nurse:  a nanny

pushes a pram, taking advantage of the last light.  This

is one of New York's most exclusive co-ops.  Distilled

civilization and quiet wealth.  A world away from Queens

or anything else.  MIKE arrives on foot.

INT./ EXT.  LOBBY - EVENING

A notice behind the locked front door informs:  "ALL

VISITORS MUST BE ANNOUNCED".  MIKE displays his shield to

the DOORMAN through the glass.  The DOORMAN opens, taking

the time to inspect his credentials before returning them,

then STEPS ASIDE, allowing ENTRY.

INT.  ELEVATOR - SAME

MIKE rides up in silence, examining the ornate walls.

INT.  VESTIBULE - CLAIRE'S APARTMENT - SAME

The elevator delivers him.  MIKE finds himself in a wall-

papered trompe l'oeil foyer.  Nothing to get his bearings.

The front door clicks open, startling him.  MARY, the

cleaning lady, an older, capable woman in functional

civilian clothes, greets him matter-of-factly, taking him

in.

INT.  CLAIRE'S LIVING ROOM - SAME

Marble-floored and high-ceilinged, absolutely palatial;

MIKE'S EYES registering amazement as he's led inward.

Floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking Central Park, where

the VOICES are REVEALED belonging to GARBER, T.J., CLAIRE,

and CLAIRE'S boyfriend, NEIL -- who's trying his best to

be "in charge".

The doorbell RINGS AGAIN:  MARY goes to answer it as MIKE

mumbles his greetings to all -- noticing that CLAIRE,

reclining on a couch, seems extremely put out -- or is it

"disinterested"?

The THIRD DETECTIVE enters, being led by MARY.  It's

KOONTZ, a package of razz and sarcasm, somebody you

definitely don't take home to mother.

ANGLE - HALLWAY

as GARBER withdraws; MIKE, T.J., KOONTZ to start their

check.

They split up.

ANGLE - MIKE

following orders, continues down the hall.  He moves to a

door that he ATTEMPTS TO OPEN -- discovering it's not

real.  It's a TROMPE L'OEIL.  He turns around to find he's

not alone in the long hall.  NEIL stands just outside the

living room, watching him.

ANGLE - NEIL

turns, returning to CLAIRE in the LIVING ROOM.

INT.  CLAIRE'S LIBRARY - MOMENTS LATER

KOONTZ checking the windows and terrace.

INT.  KITCHEN - SAME

MIKE, MARY the MAID in there with him.

INT.  CLAIRE'S BEDROOM - SAME

Utterly sumptuous; T.J. uttering a low "whistle" of awe.

INT.  CLAIRE'S POWDER ROOM

There's an enormous circular bathtub and a Jacuzzi,

endless mirrors, a writing desk, carpeted, a place one

could spend one's life in -- MIKE SEEN, in the MIRRORS,

wandering through -- idly pushing a mirrored door open, to

gaze, in awe, at the walk-in closet.

ANGLE:  He see T.J., or what he thinks is T.J., reflected

among the other reflections at the other end of the room.

Sees T.J. sit on edge of bed.  MIKE is standing in center

of the MIRRORS, slightly disoriented.  And T.J. sees him,

similarly astounded, MOVING OUT OF SHOT.

CLOSE ON MIKE:  Moving inward, he gawks at the racks of

clothes, gently brushing his hand through the lush

fabrics.  CLAIRE'S VOICE -- ANGRY, ALMOST TREMBLING, A

FIRM EFFORT OF WILL -- rustles the silence behind him.

ANGLE ON CLAIRE

MIKE:  chastened, nods.

He starts away.  MOMENTARILY baffled by the MANY-ANGLED

REFLECTIONS OF HIMSELF in the MIRRORS.

MIKE:  embarrassed, apologetic.

INT.  CLAIRE'S OUTER VESTIBULE - NIGHT

All silent; MIKE on "watch".  Just him and a wooden desk

chair, the grade-school variety.  No books, no crossword

puzzles; he came unprepared.  He checks his watch and

looks to an ornate wall clock.  And he's bored.  He picks

up an empty coffee cup, looking for a last drop.  Settles

for sniffing it.  Replaces it on the floor beside him.

Then he looks to the closed doors of the apartment and

makes a decision.  Picking up the coffee cup, he quietly

pushes the DOORS OPEN, and ENTERS.

INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

As MIKE pads quietly across the marble floors in the

quiet; pausing to gaze, in awe, at the vast, empty LIVING

ROOM.  It is gigantic, his eyes roaming the ceilings, as

though to estimate their height.

Moving inward, his eyes fall on a BOOK RACK, and he

crosses to it, perusing the shelves for possible reading

material.

They're all ART BOOKS, the big, thick kind.  A Renoir,

because of a NUDE FIGURE on the cover, catches his eye.

But as he pulls it out and begins to leaf through -- he

HEARS VOICES.  CLAIRE'S and NEIL'S; her tone is agitated.

CLOSE ON MIKE:  book under his arm, quietly moving toward

the SOURCE:  the DEN.  It's door is slightly ajar; there

is a suitcase in front of it, ready for travel.

INT.  DEN - NIGHT

She looks at him; a beat, emotionally.  He remains steady.

ANGLE - DEN.  NEIL takes her in his arms, holding her

tightly, affectionately, protectively.  Holding her from

behind, NEIL KISSES CLAIRE gently on her neck.  She calms

in his arms.

RETURN:  MIKE DODGES back quickly, through the living and

dining rooms until he's in the kitchen.

INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT

Spotting the microwave, MIKE QUICKLY TOSSES in an English

muffin -- peering at the dials, as he switches it on.

But he hasn't escaped being a trespasser to what's going

on in the far room.  He can still HEAR THEM, though HE

WHISTLES, trying not to.

The English muffin BURSTS INTO FLAMES, MIKE desperately

pulling it out, tossing it into the sink, feverishly

fanning the air.

ANOTHER ANGLE ON MIKE:  becoming aware that HE'S NOT

ALONE.  He TURNS SUDDENLY to see MARY, the housekeeper,

not ten feet from him, in the laundry room, coat on,

fluffing her collar, ready to go home.

ANGLE ON MARY:  staring at him, amused.

She moves through the kitchen and EXITS.

INT.  VESTIBULE - LATER - NIGHT

NEIL, with his briefcase, finally leaving.  He crosses

from the hallway.

The TWO EYE EACH OTHER:  MIKE attempting a cordial smile.

NEIL noticing the Renoir.

MIKE NODS.  But when NEIL leaves, he makes a mock

"military salute"; a click of the heels.

INT.  CLAIRE'S VESTIBULE - LATER

2:45 A.M. (the clock ON THE WALL); pindrop silence; MIKE

alone.

CLOSE ON MIKE:  thoughtful, leafing through the Renoir.

Like a man making the most of solitary confinement --

becoming aware of a NOISE.  Though hard to make out in

this windowless capsule, it is DISTANT THUNDER.  It stirs

life in him and his eyes wander reflexively upward,

studying the ceiling -- then the doors of the apartment,

left slightly ajar.

ANGLE INSIDE THE APARTMENT:  CAMERA FOLLOWING MIKE as he

wanders inward, becoming aware of light coming from a

drawing room.  HE MOVES TOWARD, STOPPING.

ANGLE FROM HIS POV:  CLAIRE, dimly illuminated by the

light of a desk lamp that throws a gentle glow around her

-- seated, still as statuary, gazing out into the rain.

CLOSE ON MIKE:  watching her.

INT.  SUBWAY - ON THE MOVE - LATER

The uncivilized hour indicated by the TOTALLY EMPTY

SUBWAY, MIKE a lone figure, somewhat numbed, his eyes set

into distant space -- as the SUBWAY reaches its

DESTINATION, the blurry platform signs decelerating until

we can make out the word "QUEENS".

EXT.  MIKE'S HOUSE - QUEENS

The neighborhood still asleep in the predawn hour; MIKE

picks up the newspaper... glancing at it, he opens it,

sees an article and photograph of CLAIRE on the second

page.  He heads inwards...

INT.  MIKE'S BEDROOM - DAY

Afternoon sunlight SPILLING IN as MIKE AWAKENS to the

SOUND of a CAR MOTOR, faltering, then "chug-chugging" to

another start, gasping, then revving.  Someone's working

on MIKE'S car.  He looks at his alarm clock; it's 4:00 in

the afternoon.

EXT.  MIKE'S BACKYARD - DAY

ELLIE and TOMMY visible only as fragments as they work on

MIKE'S car.  ELLIE IS SEEN as a rear-end in blue jeans,

the rest of her inside the hood; she calls to TOMMY to

"try it again".  It looks like no one's behind the wheel;

but the very top of his head CAN BE SEEN as he strains to

reach the accelerator.

ANGLE ON MIKE:  appearing at the door, in a freshly

pressed suit, a steaming cup of coffee in hand.  He walks

across the lawn towards them.

ELLIE emerges from underneath the hood, flushed.

Slamming the hood.  TOMMY revs the engine ELLIE moving

down the steps towards MIKE.

ELLIE moving towards MIKE, she slipping her hand into his

underpants:  Their eyes meet, lovingly.  She laughs.

She retrieves her cold coffee cup from the POTTING TABLE,

checks out the picture of CLAIRE in the newspaper, he's

left there.  MIKE adjusts his tie.  It's very colorful.

ELLIE playfully makes a move, JABBING AT HIM, MIKE stops

her, ending WITH A HUG.

MIKE kisses her.  ELLIE holds MIKE'S face with her gloved

hand.

ANGLE ON ELLIE:  as TOMMY comes up and leans against his

mom:  both watching MIKE primp, they share on the joke.

MIKE turns, his face with grease on it.

MIKE leaves.

INT.  CLAIRE'S KITCHEN - LATER - NIGHT

The WALL CLOCK reads 6:30.  The remains of a teeny gourmet

meal, before him on the kitchen table.

MIKE is playing an improvised hockey game, shooting peas

through a goal made up of two water glasses, using his

knife as a hockey stick.  He HEARS the CLICK of HIGH HEELS

approaching, crossing the vast marble floors.

ANGLE FROM HIS POV:  CLAIRE coming toward -- clearly

dressed for the evening, her stride signaling

determination.

She MOVES TOWARDS THE ELEVATOR:  MIKE, stymied.

INT.  ELEVATOR - SAME - NIGHT

They descend in silence, MIKE aware of being scrutinized.

The ELEVATOR STOPS, MIKE about to get off, realizing

they're stopped at the THIRD FLOOR, another TENANT

stepping on.  He's dressed in an expensive JOGGING SUIT,

his key dangling from around his neck; he nods to CLAIRE

and pushes "DOWN".  The elevator RUMBLES downward.

EXT.  CLAIRE'S BUILDING - SAME - NIGHT

The JOGGER first out the door, taking off with fierce

determination, followed by MIKE, who nervously checks the

street, then opens the limo door and checks inside, then,

finally, MOTIONS CLAIRE OUT.  She moves smoothly into the

limo; MIKE checks traffic behind them, then gets in,

after.

INT.  LIMO - SAME - NIGHT

MIKE fumbles, searching the console for the car phone.

She finds it easily, picks it up.

INT.  DOWNTOWN HEADQUARTERS - GARBER'S OFFICE

GARBER is on the other end of the line.

GARBER slams down the phone.

INT.  CLAIRE'S LIMO - NIGHT

MIKE sets down the phone.

MIKE sets down the phone.  They settle back; trying to

feel "comfortable" in one another's presence.  It's plenty

awkward.

He politely tries to place it, with no idea.

It evokes a slight smile but nothing more.

EXT.  5TH AVENUE SHOP - NIGHT

The limo pulling up, MIKE hopping expertly out before it

stops moving.

It's parked in a red zone, with tow-away signs everywhere;

a PATROLMAN notices from the curb.

He flashes his shield at the PATROLMAN, takes a firm grip

on CLAIRE'S elbow, guiding her in.

ANGLE - AT THE ENTRANCE DOORS

MIKE stiff-arms the revolving door, stopping outgoing

shoppers to clear the way for CLAIRE; hops over to the

fixed door, opening it quickly for her, hustling her

effortlessly in, zip.

ANGLE:  CLAIRE, taken by it, but not displeased.

INT.  FIFTH AVENUE SHOP - NIGHT

They cross toward the up escalator; she knows where she's

going.

CLAIRE steps onto the ESCALATOR; MIKE on alert,

scrutinizing the crowd.  He gets on right behind.  They

ascend.

At the top LANDING, A DARK-SUITED MAN VEERS RIGHT INTO

HER.  CLAIRE flinches.  MIKE MOVES PAST HER to the front,

quickly handling the guy.  The MAN jumps back.

ANGLE ON MIKE; SHAKEN.  CLAIRE giving him a long unsteady

look, too.

INT.  SHOP - GIFT COUNTER - NIGHT

MIKE keeping close watch as CLAIRE approves her purchase:

a silver frame, containing an inscribed photo of CLAIRE

and an elegant older woman.

CLAIRE walks past MIKE.

MIKE follows her.

CLAIRE at the TIE COUNTER, points to the tie rack.

MIKE begins to connect, glancing down again at the tie

he's wearing.  CLAIRE selects a TIE, turning to the

SALESPERSON, for his reaction.

CLAIRE handing it to the SALESPERSON.

CLAIRE gives a look to the clerk to go ahead with her

order.  SALESPERSON goes off.

INT.  THE LIMO - IN MOTION - SAME - NIGHT

MIKE AND CLAIRE; CLAIRE favorably assessing him in the new

tie.

He looks down at it in silence; then, finally:

CLOSE ON CLAIRE:  his vulnerability makes her smile.

EXT.  GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM - NIGHT

Clearly a "big deal," with Kleig lights and heavy

LIMOUSINE and TAXI traffic being directed into place by

COPS, some of whom we recognize.

ANGLE ON A PAIR OF COPS, using flashlights to guide

traffic -- spotting CLAIRE'S LIMOUSINE with the BLACK-AND-

WHITE PATROL CAR following it, and signaling it into

place.

The COP OPENS THE DOOR -- stunned to see MIKE STEP OUT, in

suit and new tie -- looking like he belongs there.

CLAIRE steps out, utterly elegant, taking MIKE'S arm --

the traffic COPS now joined by those from the BLACK-AND-

WHITE, as MIKE and CLAIRE head INWARD.  The COPS wolf-

whistle MIKE and razz him as they go, some beginning the

STRAINS of "Just a Gigolo"...

MIKE GIVES THEM THE FINGER behind his back.

INT.  THE RECEPTION - SAME - NIGHT

MIKE and CLAIRE caught in a crush of people jamming the

ENTRANCE WAY -- their bodies coming into close contact, so

close that MIKE is forced into an awkward posture in order

to stay close to her; one arm up in the air, uncomfortable

about taking her arm.

He takes her arm, guiding her through the crowd.

The SOUND of a WOMAN'S (MARGE GOODWIN) VOICE attracts

their attention.

She's a SOCIETY MATRON-TYPE, grabbing CLAIRE in an ever-

so-concerned HUG.

But ANTONIA, an elegant OLDER WOMAN, has already SPOTTED

HER.

She pushes through, and fairly falls into CLAIRE'S arms.

ANTONIA almost emotionally overcome, that CLAIRE has

managed it.

ANTONIA looks up to see MIKE.

She looks up to SEE MIKE:  it directs others to do the

same.

INT.  THE RECEPTION - LATER - NIGHT

CLAIRE in the thick of things -- a BAND PLAYING NOW --

occasionally glancing at MIKE -- who stands against a

wall, ever watchful...

CLOSE ON MIKE: TURNING to see a VERY PRETTY YOUNG THING

come up to him; just "oozing" seduction.

MIKE nods; eyes fixed on CLAIRE.

MIKE'S eyes register abject dumbfoundment.

HE PUSHES TOWARD CLAIRE, catching her eye.

CLAIRE relaxed, clearly having a good time.

She plows toward the crowded bar, just inside the ballroom

entrance, MIKE following.

CLOSE ON MIKE:  Not amused.  CLAIRE heads to the ladies'

room across from the bar.  MIKE watches her enter.  Turns

back to the bar, which is very busy and confused.

MIKE seeing the Pretty Young Thing.

INT.  LADIES' ROOM - SAME - NIGHT

as a pair of WOMEN finish their "touch-up" and head out,

making way for CLAIRE to step up to the mirror to assess

herself.  The room momentarily empties.  Putting her purse

down she moves to a stall and enters.

INT.  BAR COUNTER - NIGHT

MIKE, waiting, glancing back at the door as the TWO WOMEN

EXIT, then turns to the BARMAN to receive the drinks.

INT.  LADIES' ROOM - SAME

LOW ANGLE on the door -- as a pair of men's shoes pass

through frame.

CLOSE ON CLAIRE, inside a stall SHE HEARS FOOTSTEPS

QUIETLY ENTER, followed by a CLICK of a DOOR.  It's not

the click of a stall door, because the FOOTSTEPS then

proceed inward; WE HEAR A STALL DOOR CLOSE and LOCK.  It

gives her momentary pause, but she dismisses it, looking

for her purse -- realizing she left it on the sink --

opening her stall door and heading out.

She barely hears the "click" of the bolt sliding behind

her -- and looks up, into the MIRROR, SEEING VENZA appear

behind her.  She SPINS -- but doesn't have time to CRY

OUT.  He's grabbed her by the THROAT.

INT.  BALLROOM - SAME MOMENT - NIGHT

MIKE and the PRETTY YOUNG THING:  she doesn't notice him

trying to drift away.

INT.  LADIES' ROOM - SAME - NIGHT

CLAIRE attempting to breathe -- her FACE being brought to

within an inch of his.

CLOSE ON CLAIRE:  her eyes wide with TERROR.  He rubs his

thumb across her mouth, smearing the lipstick.

To make his point, he SQUEEZES HARDER -- CLAIRE'S eyes

bulging, as TEARS run from her eyes.

INT.  MUSEUM - UPPER TIER - SAME - NIGHT

MIKE, finally putting distance between him and the "PRETTY

YOUNG THING."

ANGLE:  MIKE, as he catches sight of a back of a man

(VENZA) moving out of the ladies' room.  Stunned, MIKE

PIVOTS, TURNING, SPRINTING IN THE DIRECTION of the ladies'

room.

OUTSIDE THE LADIES' ROOM:  Two women just go in.  MIKE

pushes his way in, slamming the door behind him.  The

OTHER WOMEN GASP, seeing MIKE invading their sanctuary.

INSIDE THE LADIES' ROOM:  MIKE

CLOSE ON MIKE:  RELIEVED BUT SHOCKED to see CLAIRE,

disheveled, lipstick smeared across her mouth, throat and

face, but otherwise uninjured.

MIKE turns, calling to the TWO WOMEN coming in.

MIKE TAKES OFF AFTER VENZA --

INT.  UPPER TIER

OUT OF LADIES' ROOM, AND UP THE RAMP TO THE NEAREST (THE

UPPER) LEVEL.

ANGLE:  He sees VENZA get into the ELEVATOR.  These is

only one place for it to go -- DOWN.  MIKE CHANGES

DIRECTION and FRANTICALLY RUNS DOWN THE SPIRALING RAMP

trying to keep pace with the descent of the elevator.  At

the GROUND LEVEL HE SEES THE ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN and VENZA

EXITS AMIDST THE PARTY.

ANGLE ON VENZA:  VENZA MAKES HIS WAY TO THE FRONT ENTRANCE

AND EXITS THE BUILDING.

ANGLE ON MIKE:  MIKE HURTLES DOWN THE RAMP AND DESPERATELY

FIGHTS HIS WAY THROUGH THE CENTER of the PARTY and OUT the

FRONT ENTRANCE.

EXT.  GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM - NIGHT

MIKE EXITS the BUILDING bewildered; lost him... RUNS

BLINDLY amidst PEDESTRIANS -- SPOTS VENZA AHEAD.

ANGLE ON VENZA reaching someone MIKE CAN'T SEE.  MIKE puts

his hand in his jacket for his gun.

VENZA HEARS and SLOWS, but DOESN'T TURN.  ONLOOKERS turn.

VENZA is talking to someone, taking his time.

ANGLE ON VENZA:  untroubled, turning; raising his arms,

and SMILING.

ANGLE ON MIKE:  confused -- seeing that the man VENZA

stopped to talk to is a PATROLMAN, he'd stopped to give

himself up.

CLOSE ON MIKE:  breathless as he moves toward VENZA.  MIKE

frisks VENZA as he turns, SMILING at MIKE.

INT.  PRECINCT - DAY

MIKE and T.J. with GARBER, MIKE being CONGRATULATED by

COPS who pass.  But GARBER doesn't look happy.

GARBER turns on his heel, ENTERING HIS OFFICE; leaving

MIKE looking at T.J.  Dismayed.

EXT.  TRACT HOME - BROOKLYN HEIGHTS - AFTERNOON

A tree-lined neighborhood.  The house has a FOR SALE sign

in front; MIKE is standing in front of a cab, he's dressed

for work -- he looks around.  The cab pulls out, he heads

for the front door.

INT.  TRACT HOME - AFTERNOON

MIKE enters the house.  It's nothing special.  ELLIE is in

another room.  She joins MIKE.

ELLIE begins to show him the place.

ANGLE ON MIKE:  preoccupied.

He nods, trying hard to "be there," but ELLIE isn't

fooled; she assesses him with concern.

A beat.

He's wearing the tie CLAIRE bought him.

PAUSE.  DEAD SILENCE.

His VOICE resonates through the empty house, creating a

ringing silence.  ELLIE begins to giggle.

MIKE smiles, she gives him a kiss, and a flick on the

nose.

INT.  DEN - LATER - NIGHT

The WALL CLOCK reads 9:45.  CLAIRE is working at her desk.

She gets up and moves into the hallway where she sees MIKE

through the half-opened door.  CLAIRE moves to the

doorway.

An awkward silence.

She laughs, he smiles, both attempting to make light of

it.  But it's hard to make light of; the attempt quickly

fades.

MIKE nods; buttoning his lip.

MIKE is TORN.

She starts to walk away.

He marks it in his CROSSWORDS:  she moves closer,leaning

over his shoulder to see.

In the SILENCE that follows, their eyes on each other,

appraising.

EXT.  FIFTH AVENUE - NIGHT

CLAIRE and MIKE walking; her arm looped in his -- the

BLACK-AND-WHITE keeping pace alongside them -- their

conversation animated, clearly enjoying one another's

company.

He demonstrates a peculiar walk; arms and legs moving in

ridiculous awkwardness.

She takes off down the street; walking stupidly, worse

than he did -- he's LAUGHING as he WATCHES HER GO.

INT.  PATROL CAR - NIGHT

The COPS following exchange dubious glances, getting a

glimpse of the strangeness.

INT.  PIANO BAR - NIGHT

CAMERA FINDING CLAIRE and MIKE, at a small table, in

darkness, a piano bar playing in the background.  The song

being sung is "SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME."

He hesitates; but nods.

Her envy is plain.

ANGLE ON BOTH:  the music playing.

CLOSE ON MIKE:  feeling a moment of awkwardness.

EXT.  CITY STREET - NIGHT

The PATROL CAR keeping pace as the two walk home; the COPS

in the BLACK-AND-WHITE exchange a look at what they are

seeing.  MIKE is holding her arm, she's huddled up; she is

cold and he removes his topcoat and puts it around her

shoulders.

EXT.  CLAIRE'S BUILDING - NIGHT

The PATROL CAR comes to a STOP as MIKE and CLAIRE ENTER.

ANGLE ON THE TWO COPS AGAIN:  watching them go.

INT.  CLAIRE'S ELEVATOR - NIGHT

As they ride up in silence -- on opposite sides of the

elevator -- looking at each other.  It comes to a stop,

and neither moves; the tension is palpable.

She steps out first, he follows.  She moves to the doors

and stops -- her shoulders visibly relaxing as he moves up

behind her.  But he stops, too.  And she turns.

ANOTHER ANGLE:  Both captive to indecision.  It is he who

makes it, just by staying immobile for too long.  She

smiles and takes off her coat, holding it out to him.  And

in the moment of exchange is the return to reality.

She turns to open the door.  Entering she -- and we --

suddenly can see Neil pacing in the hall, b.g.  He's

returned.  He looks up, worried and very upset.

CLOSE ANGLES ON FACES.

INT.  DOWNTOWN HEADQUARTERS - DAY

MIKE heading down a LONG HALL TOWARD GARBER'S OFFICE:

It's like running a gauntlet.

That one got to him; stopped dead by it, he turns, giving

KOONTZ a challenging look.

CLOSE ON MIKE:  cooling down -- then girding himself for

GARBER.

INT.  CORRIDOR - DAY

GARBER and MIKE on the carpet.

In the room next to the corridor, KOONTZ interrupts the

shift already there, entering.

The OTHER COPS grab their things and scatter, not wanting

to get involved in another cop's headache.

INT.  FARTHER DOWN THE CORRIDOR - SAME - DAY

CLAIRE approaching with NEIL, with T.J. on guard-duty.

MIKE AND CLAIRE catch each other's eyes.  He sees how

nervous she is.

NEIL catches MIKE'S glance at her; reassures himself with

a glance at CLAIRE, straightens, still steamed from last

night.

GARBER picks up on it, not liking the tension, especially

not now; his eyes throw daggers at MIKE.

GARBER TURNS, getting them started.

INT.  VIEWING ROOM - SAME - DAY

They crowd in; another MAN already standing there --

VENZA'S PARK AVENUE LAWYER.  A one-way window looks into

the brightness of the line-up (squad) room that's emptied

now and undergoing preparation by KOONTZ.

GARBER to CLAIRE, a professional reassurance.

With that, GARBER leads NEIL out.  NEIL manages a final

concerned stare at CLAIRE before he goes.  The DOOR

CLOSES.  MIKE, CLAIRE, and an unruffled MR. NEUMAN, THE

LAWYER, are left alone in the cramped space.

INT.  LINE-UP ROOM - SAME - DAY

KOONTZ beckons VENZA and the OTHER FOUR LINE-UP

PARTICIPANTS IN.

VENZA enters confidently, with the others.  He's number

three.  He takes his place, staring unconcernedly past the

bright lights toward the direction of the mirrored window,

as if he could see through it, into CLAIRE'S EYES.

INT.  VIEWING ROOM - SAME - DAY

CLAIRE, staring expressionless, her eyes etched with fear.

MIKE aware of that fear.  VENZA'S LAWYER waiting

patiently, casually.

INT.  LINE-UP ROOM - DAY

VENZA and the OTHERS WAITING, now STANDING ON DISPLAY.

VENZA'S JAW TIGHTENS, a flicker, before catching himself

and controlling the reaction.  Realizing.  She's making

positive identification.

INT.  SUBWAY - EVENING

MIKE, empty-eyed.  On his way HOME.

INT.  MIKE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

ELLIE dressed for sleep, in a DISNEYWORLD T-SHIRT, pauses

to glance with worried eyes -- toward the living room

where WE HEAR the SOUND of a TV.

ANGLE ON MIKE:  on a couch, beer in hand -- mindlessly

watching.

She accepts it, reluctantly -- returning to the BEDROOM.

CLOSE ON MIKE:  hitting the remote to SCAN the channels;

troubled.

INT.  CLAIRE'S DEN - EVENING

CLAIRE at ease on the couch, staring, trying to follow the

images of the television.  NEIL, at the bar, pours them

both a drink.

He steps forward with her drink.

She straightens, suddenly attentive, in response to

something on the TV.

It's a REPORT FROM OUTSIDE THE COURTHOUSE, with the TV

NEWSMAN reporting:

ANGLE ON NEIL, watching.

He gives her a drink, leaning down to kiss her on the

forehead.

INT.  MIKE'S KITCHEN - MORNING

Where life has indeed returned to normal, except for the

heavy weight of memory.  MIKE, at the counter, makes

SANDWICHES, packing a cooler for the game.  He grabs TOMMY

with an arm-hook as TOMMY tries to swipe a sandwich on the

pass through.

Roughhousing TOMMY, MIKE gets him squealing.  ELLIE

enters, stomping her feet clean, coming in from the

garden.

She blows on her hands, shows MIKE how cold, putting them

against his cheeks.

She does it to TOMMY, too, except he's too fast for her,

yelling and squirming out of the way.  The PHONE RINGS.

ELLIE doesn't answer it.  TOMMY picks it up.

He offers the phone out to ELLIE.

MIKE takes it.  ELLIE turns to TOMMY, who yelps and darts

away, avoiding her cold touch.

He SLAMS DOWN THE PHONE, raging.

In a fit of RAGE, he SWIPES at a MILK CARTON, sending it

HURTLING AGAINST A WALL.  ANGLE on TOMMY:  amazed.

SILENCE.

He dumps the rest of the lunch preparations in the sink,

exiting.

ANGLE on TOMMY and ELLIE looking distraught.

INT.  CLAIRE'S KITCHEN - EVENING

MUSIC TURNED UP FULL.

CLAIRE spills red wine over the counter, uncorking the

bottle.  She leaves the stain, grabbing the bottle and a

wine glass, taking them with her, in emotional extremis.

EXT.  CLAIRE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - EVENING

ANGLE on MIKE:  as he rounds a corner ALMOST BUMPING INTO

the JOGGER from CLAIRE'S BUILDING; MIKE hurries,

sidestepping him, HEADING toward the ENTRANCE.

ANGLE FROM HIS POV:  CLAIRE'S FRONT ENTRANCE; extra

SECURITY -- A SQUAD CAR PARKED IN FRONT now.

ANGLE ON MIKE:  SPRINTING INWARD.

INT.  CLAIRE'S VESTIBULE - SAME - NIGHT

The ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN and MIKE steps out, breathless,

confronting KOONTZ.  The MUSIC CONTINUES TO BLAST from

behind the closed apartment doors.

KOONTZ grabbing his stuff, massive understatement.

He holds up a beer bottle; half-filled with urine.

HE WILLINGLY LEAVE, and MIKE WAITS but a split second,

before going to the doors.  They are closed.  MUSIC blares

from within.  No other response.

INT.  CLAIRE'S LIVING ROOM - SAME - NIGHT

Distraught, CLAIRE tries to bring herself back from the

brink, placing the wine bottle rack down after she's

poured.

The lock turns and it opens, but just a crack, enough to

see that she's hysterical, her eyes reddened from crying.

Near bursting, she SLAMS THE DOOR, leaving MIKE STUNNED:

Inside, the MUSIC is TURNED UP AGAIN to THUNDEROUS

PROPORTIONS.

Clenching his fists, MIKE PACES in frustration, then SLAMS

his fist against the wall -- NOTICING the door has failed

to FULLY SHUT.

HE PUSHES IT OPEN, ENTERING THE APARTMENT, CAMERA

FOLLOWING HIM as he looks for her.  The MUSIC, bounding

off the high ceilings and marble floors, is thunderous.

INT.  CLAIRE'S HALL - NIGHT

He moves HURRIEDLY DOWN THE HALL to her BEDROOM, entering,

without warning, to SEE HER REFLECTION in the MIRROR as

she PULLS ON SOME CLOTHES.

The dress on, she SWEEPS past him, heading toward the

doors.

She heads out the bedroom door.

INT.  HALL - SAME - NIGHT

ANGLE ON CLAIRE:  as she heads down the hall moving fast,

he's right behind her.

HE GRABS HER, SPINNING HER AROUND.

Their physicality reaches a CLIMAX with MIKE pinning her

against the wall, she, restrained by him, finally GIVING

UP, with a SOB, and COLLAPSING INTO HIS ARMS.

ANGLE ON CLAIRE:  gasping as she clings to him.

He holds her; makes a tentative move toward her -- and

stops.  She CLOSES THE DISTANCE.  THEY KISS.  They

separate, making sure.  They KISS AGAIN, certain.

INT.  MIKE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

ELLIE startles awake, premonitorily.

ELLIE:  She turns in the darkness to look at the clock.

Heart beating, she reclines again, lying awake, realizing

what it was that woke her.  She listens, hearing it again.

A shuffling SOUND, something moving, outside.

She stirs, sitting up, listening.

ANGLE:  Only silence answers.

ELLIE gets up, dissatisfied by the silence, and moves to

the rear bedroom window.

AT THE REAR WINDOW, she looks out into the darkness.

HER POV - BACK YARD

It's almost impossible to see anything.  Nothing moves.

INT.  HALL/LANDING - NIGHT

ELLIE closes TOMMY'S door, listens again for the SOUND;

starts quietly down the stairs.

INT.  DOWNSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT

ELLIE reaches the ground floor, moving for the kitchen.

INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT

ELLIE enters.  She GASPS.  A SMALL SHADOWED FIGURE TURNS,

CONFRONTING HER.  It's TOMMY, having left his room

earlier.

Recovering from the scare, ELLIE grabs him, relieved,

sinking to her KNEES and HOLDING HIM TIGHT.

INT.  CLAIRE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

MIKE gets up, dressing.  CLAIRE watches from the bed.  He

returns her gaze, reluctant to go, but hesitating to touch

her again.  CLAIRE clasps his hand, bringing him closer.

They kiss, in affirmation.

INT.  VESTIBULE - NIGHT

MIKE stands by the front door as T.J. arrives to begin

his duty.

MIKE nods, absently, entering the elevator.  The PHONE

starts to RING in the apartment.

INT.  SUBWAY - EARLY A.M. - NIGHT

MIKE; miserable.  The "QUEENS" exit is SEEN APPROACHING

through the TRAIN WINDOW; he attempts to pull himself

together, rising, waiting for the train to stop.

EXT.  MIKE'S STREET - SAME

As MIKE rounds the corner and looks up.  His breath

catches.  His heart starts to pound.

AHEAD, lights ablaze.  ONE COP CAR is in front of his

HOUSE, and a JEEP (Belonging to SCOTTY).  MIKE BREAKS INTO

A RUN.

INT.  MIKE'S ENTRY - NIGHT - MORNING

He rushes in.  The front door is unlocked, lights are on,

but otherwise there is nothing different.  He hears

VOICES.

INT.  MIKE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT - MORNING

MIKE hurries in.  The room is bright.  SCOTTY and another

cop, BROOKLYN from the 117th, look up from the kitchen

table, nursing cups of coffee.  BROOKLYN is on duty;

SCOTTY has come over on his own.

TOMMY has long since been ushered back to bed.  ELLIE

making coffee at the stove, turns as MIKE enters.

She is okay, returning MIKE'S stare with embarrassment.

SCOTTY collects his gun from the table, rising.

He gives her a peck, yawning.

SCOTTY waves her off with a goodbye, exiting after

BROOKLYN.  ELLIE turns back to MIKE.

She shakes her head, amused.

CLOSE ON MIKE.  Feeling like absolute hell.

INT.  MIKE AND ELLIE'S DINING ROOM - AFTERNOON

MIKE is threading his necktie.  ELLIE stands behind him,

in the kitchen, grinning.

She leaves the room, slamming the door behind her.  He

looks at himself in the mirror, wondering what's possessed

him.

INT.  MIKE'S KITCHEN - DAY

MIKE sits at the table with a cup of coffee.  He watches

ELLIE from the window.

MIKE'S POV

ELLIE:  Tight jeans, workshirt, scarf tied around her

head, she looks great.  She looks up, rinsing a greasy

grill over a bucket of hot water, playfully sprays the

window with the hose, seeing him watching her.

INT.  SUBWAY - EVENING

MIKE walking along the platform amidst the crowded car,

returning to his work and his destination.

INT.  CLAIRE'S ENTRY HALL - EVENING

A heavy silence.  MIKE sitting, on duty again.  He keeps

to himself.  He doesn't move from his chair.

CLAIRE finally enters.  She holds tensely, waiting, aware

of his mood.

His stare is unyielding.

He looks up.

She walks away; MIKE sits.

INT.  CLAIRE'S STUDY

She turns to her table to resume work.  Scribbled pages

litter the surface.  Her hands betray her.  It's an effort

of will.  MIKE enters, moving closer.

Beginning to cry, she feels his embrace, turning into it.

INT.  CLAIRE'S BEDROOM - EARLY A.M. - NIGHT

CLAIRE lies asleep.  MIKE leans over her as she wakes,

meeting his gaze, bringing him closer before he goes.

They kiss.  He withdraws, tenderly returning her gaze and

returning her to sleep.

INT.  HER HALLWAY - EARLY A.M. - NIGHT

T.J. standing in the hallway.

ANGLE ON T.J., as the bedroom DOOR OPENS -- REVEALING

MIKE.  T.J. recoils with surprise.

MIKE steps out, closing the door behind him; distraught.

T.J. issues a long, saddened sigh; just staring at him.

INT.  MIKE AND ELLIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

MIKE sits in a chair by the far wall, staring out toward

Manhattan, which glows palely, in the distance.  Now PAN

OVER THE BED where ELLIE lies asleep.  But as WE MOVE

CLOSE TO HER FACE, WE SEE she is not asleep; wide-eyed,

aware of MIKE in the chair.

INT.  MIKE AND ELLIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - LATER

ELLIE stirs as MIKE slips between the sheets.  She

embraces him, starts to kiss him.  He rolls over.

A moment of silence.

More silence.

She snuggles up to him.

INT.  BROOKLYN RESTAURANT - EVENING

THE LIGHTS of New York beginning to sparkle against a

darkening sky; MIKE and ELLIE at a table that looks out on

the East River.  It's an OK restaurant, not the poshest in

the world.  ELLIE finds herself carrying most of the

conversation.  They scan menus to order.

CLOSE ON MIKE:  incredulous.

MIKE is nonplused; not knowing how to respond.

He shakes his head, dismissively.

No response; MIKE having trouble with it.

CLOSE ON ELLIE:  sensing deception.  Her eyes begin to

glisten.

CLOSE ON MIKE:  seeing her distress.  Unable to hide his

own.

She looks at him -- and knowing him as well as she does,

is certain.  She puts a hand in front of her mouth in an

attempt not to cry.

Her eyes flush with tears.

She UPSETS her SETTING, GETTING UP from the TABLE, shaking

him off.

She BOLTS from the room; MIKE following her.

EXT.  RESTAURANT - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

She weaves toward the car.  MIKE goes after her.

She TURNS and SWINGS AT HIM, catching him SQUARE IN THE

NOSE; he's stunned and bleeding.

She RUNS to her car, BURNING RUBBER as she PEELS out of

the PARKING LOT -- leaving MIKE, distraught, gazing after

her.

EXT.  PHONE BOOTH - BROOKLYN BRIDGE - SAME - EVENING

TRAFFIC ROARING BY -- revealing MIKE, upset, on a pay

phone, a finger in one ear, waiting for the phone to

answer.

He HANGS UP:  miserable.

EXT.  CLAIRE'S BUILDING - EVENING

A SQUAD CAR parked in front, CAMERA PANNING to the DOORS,

as the JOGGER (MR. SPARKS) EXITS, dressed in his usual

outfit, POUNDING DETERMINEDLY across the street.

ANOTHER ANGLE:  as he LOPES INTO THE PARK.

ANOTHER ANGLE:  as he REACHES a STOPLIGHT CROSSING that's

"RED"; he waits to cross, jogging in place; crosses into

the park.  A sinister lone black LIMO approaches, slowing

to a stop behind him, its back door slowly swinging open,

engulfing our sight of him...

EXT.  CLAIRE'S BUILDING - LATER

The "JOGGER" returning, obscuring his identity from the

parked PATROL CAR, by wiping his face with a towel.

Before heading to the door, where a DOORMAN stands guard,

he delays as though WAITING FOR SOMETHING.

It's happening:  A dainty teenage VIETNAMESE GIRL,

distracts the DOORMAN at his post, getting enough of his

attention SELLING FLOWERS, and SPOUTING VIETNAMESE, for

the "JOGGER" to SLIP BY, making it inside.

ANGLE:  VIETNAMESE GIRL, still spouting.

ANGLE: VIETNAMESE GIRL, backing off, seeing the JOGGER

slip by and her mission accomplished.

THE GIRL:  slyly cursing the DOORMAN in Vietnamese as she

skips off.

INT.  BUILDING LOBBY - SAME

The "JOGGER," his face still obscured by the towel waits

for the elevator, as T.J., arriving, ENTERS the building.

They both enter the elevator in silence.

ANGLE on T.J. glancing at the JOGGER quizzically.  The

JOGGER avoids his stare, CAMERA TILTING UP to the

indicator, beginning to rise.

INT.  SPARKS' VESTIBULE

CLOSE ON "JOGGER'S" key, entering the LOCK.  IT TURNS.

CLOSE ON HIS FACE.  He ENTERS.

INT.  SPARKS' APARTMENT - SAME

As the killer closes the door.  He's in the kitchen.  All

is quiet in there.

IN CLOSEUPS, WE SEE his JOGGING SHIRT coming off,

revealing a shoulder holster; a specially designed "belt"

removed and laid on the kitchen table.  A "SILENCER"

within.

INT.  CLAIRE'S KITCHEN - EVENING

CLAIRE eagerly and earnestly preparing dinner.  She makes

some fluffs, not really used to this.  CLASSICAL MUSIC

plays.  She looks up expectantly, hearing the FOOTSTEPS.

CLOSE ON CLAIRE:  surprised to see it's T.J.

CLAIRE:  She handles it, crestfallen.

T.J. spots, over his shoulder, the table, set for two.

Nothing left to say; she hides her disappointment with a

nod.

EXT.  CITY STREET - FIFTH AVENUE - NIGHT

Active with nightlife; CAMERA PANNING to a lone figure

walking in the night.  It's MIKE; his collar turned up

against the cold, his face grim and pensive.  He passes an

art gallery and PAUSES to gaze in, his eyes refocusing on

his own reflection staring back at him.

INT.  CLAIRE'S APARTMENT - SAME - NIGHT

CLAIRE immobile, on a window seat in her LIVING ROOM, the

CLASSICAL MUSIC still playing softly in the background,

her eyes empty as she gazes out into the park.

THE MUSIC CONTINUES OVER:

EXT.  CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT

Outside and far below, the GLOW from the tip of a

CIGARETTE REDDENS the darkness with an inhalation.

VENZA:  He stands, impervious to the cold, looking up at

the windows of CLAIRE'S apartment.

ANGLE UP TO CLAIRE:  SILHOUETTED in the distant window.

VENZA:  finishes his butt, flicks it, satisfied, getting

into HIS CAR curbside and driving away.

INT.  CLAIRE'S VESTIBULE - NIGHT

T.J., DOZING as the ELEVATOR INDICATOR HEADS UPWARD --

finally reaching our FLOOR.

The DOORS OPEN, STARTLING T.J.  He stares at MIKE with

DISMAY.  MUSIC IS HEARD from just inside.

MIKE ENTERS, closing the doors behind him.

INT.  CLAIRE'S APARTMENT - SAME - NIGHT

Silent, save for CLASSICAL MUSIC -- as MIKE quietly

enters.

He pauses a moment, his eyes filled with unhappiness, then

MOVES in the direction of the MUSIC -- SPOTTING CLAIRE,

immobile since we last saw her, still gazing out the

window.

CLOSE ON MIKE:  as always, AFFECTED BY HER.

She becomes aware of his presence and slowly TURNS.  For a

long moment, neither seems willing to move -- or speak.

Finally, he does.

She absorbs it, without response.

She nods.  Thoughtfully.  As though willing to deal with

it intellectually, but avoiding any encounter with her

emotions.

Her eyes turn to his.  She moves toward him and sits.

CLAIRE pulls him close to her.  A soft GERSHWIN TUNE

plays.  She sees how drawn MIKE is.

INT.  CLAIRE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

It's quiet.  MIKE sleeps deeply on the bed.  CLAIRE does

her work at the bedroom desk nearby; glances gently over,

keeping her watch, glad of the feeling.

INT.  SPARKS' APARTMENT - SAME - NIGHT

The MERV GRIFFIN SHOW playing on the TV; it ends, a VOICE

OVER indicating to "stay tuned for the news".  It is

SILENCED by remote control -- we HEAR FOOTSTEPS moving

away.

ANGLE INSIDE THE KITCHEN:  CLOSE on the murderous

paraphernalia left on the kitchen table, being assembled

by the "JOGGER".

INT.  CLAIRE'S VESTIBULE - SAME - NIGHT

The apartment pin-quiet and darkened.  T.J. in his chair

-- head arched back; snoring; his self-help book abandoned

on the floor.

INT.  SPARKS' VESTIBULE - SAME - NIGHT

SPARKS' FRONT DOOR quietly "CLICKING" SHUT as the KILLER

EXITS.

CLOSER ANGLE:  THE BUTTON of the ELEVATOR being PUSHED by

a GLOVED HAND.  It activates a "HUM."

INT.  CLAIRE'S APARTMENT - SAME - NIGHT

LONG ANGLE down the HALL, on the CLOSED DOOR TO THE

BEDROOM SUITE.

INT.  CLAIRE'S VESTIBULE - SAME - NIGHT

As the ELEVATOR slides to a stop, its DOOR GLIDING OPEN.

THE KILLER, keeping himself flattened back out of sight,

glances quickly out, gun and reflexes at the ready.

It's unnecessary.  The vestibule's deserted; T.J.'S post

is momentarily empty.

The KILLER steps silently, EASING out the elevator.

INT.  CLAIRE'S APARTMENT - SAME - NIGHT

T.J. at the TOILET; yawning as he pees.

INT.  CLAIRE'S HALLWAY - SAME - NIGHT

The KILLER pauses, hearing the TOILET FLUSH, retreats the

other way.

INT.  CLAIRE'S APARTMENT - SAME - NIGHT

As T.J. emerges from the bathroom.  He stretches, trying

to shake his fatigue.  Making a decision, he HEADS for the

KITCHEN to get a cup of coffee -- CAMERA FOLLOWING HIM as

he ENTERS, snapping on the light.

MOVING directly to the stove, he examines the Mr. Coffee;

the red "ON" button glows, but the pot is virtually empty.

Picking it up, he MOVES TO THE SINK, turning on the tap,

which is a thin, gooseneck spigot.  He look up, hearing a

slight SHUFFLE, seeing the KILLER'S FEET sticking out of

the shadows of the floor of the LAUNDRY ROOM.

T.J. reacts -- TOO LATE -- there's a slight chung, and a

hole opens up in T.J.'S gut; the bullet that went through

him, ricocheting and nicking off the end of the thin,

curving tap, sending a stream of water gushing straight

up.

The KILLER moves quickly, catching T.J.'S body, trying to

break its fall as it hits the floor.

INT.  CLAIRE'S BEDROOM - SAME - NIGHT

CLAIRE asleep in MIKE'S PROTECTIVE EMBRACE:  MIKE, awake,

his eyes to the bedside table, notices the almost

imperceptible disturbance of VIBRATION ripple the surface

of the DRINK left there by the clock.

MIKE sits up; as if by instinct, sensing something is

wrong.  CLAIRE continues to sleep.

INT.  CLAIRE'S HALLWAY/OUTER BEDROOM - SAME - NIGHT

The KILLER OPENS THE BEDROOM SUITE DOOR, steps into the

ANTEROOM.  Off to the right is the closed DOOR of the

BEDROOM.  He steps in the direction, reaching the doorknob

-- thinks twice about it, though, seeing the door on the

other side of the anteroom which would take him the

longer, but unexpected route into the bedroom.  He backs

off, moving silently to the OTHER DOOR, turning it open

silently and slipping through into the CLOSET and WALK-

THROUGH DRESSING ROOM leading to the bedroom by the far

side.

INT.  CLAIRE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

MIKE:  on the other side of the door, listening.

He opens the door quietly, sees the anteroom door ajar,

remembering that he had closed it before.  He tightens,

closing the door and moving back to his gun in its holster

draped over the chair with his other clothes.

INT.  DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

The KILLER enters the reflective maze.

INT.  MASTER BATH - NIGHT

MIKE moves silently, backtracking through the bedroom and

bathroom toward the DOORS leading to the dressing room

ahead.

INT.  DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

The KILLER passes the door he wants, thinking it's just

another mirror; finds himself in the totally MIRRORED

ENVIRONMENT of the MAIN DRESSING AREA.

On the other side of the door, MIKE HEARS HIM, tightening

his grip on his gun and on the doorknob as he REACHES for

it.  MIKE grasps it, turning and opening the door

silently.  But the latch connects to the light, and the

LIGHT GOES ON OVERHEAD of MIKE.

The KILLER reacts quickly, gun drawn, on the turn.  But he

faces SEVERAL REFLECTIONS OF MIKE in front of him -- and

MIKE IS BEHIND HIM.

MIKE LEVELS AIM AT HIM.

The KILLER takes his chances, WHIRLING.  MIKE FIRES FIRST,

NAILING HIM right through the HEAD.  The KILLER SPINS

AGAIN, SLAMMING UP against the MIRRORS and falling DEAD to

the floor.

IN THE BEDROOM:  CLAIRE wakes.

MIKE:  checking quickly on the dead assassin, flattens

himself against the wall and scurries back through the

bath the way back into the BEDROOM.

CLAIRE does what he says.

MIKE RACES into the CORRIDOR, hugging the wall; he PAUSES

momentarily, then RACES down the HALL.

ANGLE ON THE OPENED FRONT DOOR as he REACHES IT, seeing

T.J.'S CHAIR empty.

MIKE RUNS, frantically, into the living room, the

bathroom, the den -- CAMERA FOLLOWING HIM into the

KITCHEN.

CLOSE ON HIS FACE:  twisting with GRIEF.

ANGLE ON T.J. face down in a pool of blood, MIKE RACING

TO HIM, rolling him over.

MIKE moves by REFLEX, starting mouth-to-mouth.  But there

is blood everywhere.

MIKE desperate; pumping T.J.'S chest.

CLAIRE appears behind him, to help.

She RUNS to the KITCHEN PHONE; it's dead, the WIRES CUT.

She TURNS, HURRYING to the VESTIBULE and THE ELEVATOR,

pulling the alarm, sagging in collapse.  The ALARM goes

off within the shaft, THROUGHOUT the building.

ANGLE ON MIKE:  shirtless and shoeless, on his knees in

T.J.'S blood, desperately pumping his chest.

INT.  HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NEAR DAWN

MIKE alone on a bench, his head in his hands:  a couple of

COPS we recognize from the Precinct stand a distance away,

at a coffee machine, talking softly as they glance at him.

It is not yet dawn.

FOOTSTEPS are HEARD coming TOWARD; MIKE looks up to see

GARBER APPROACHING, his expression appropriate to the

occasion.  GARBER reaches him; they exchange a long look,

MIKE'S eyes etched with anguish.

A long pause, as he looks at MIKE.

GARBER:  aware of his own dilemma.

ANGLE ON MIKE:  responding with a silent nod as GARBER

stands looking down at him.

No response.

In the response that follows, they HEAR MOVEMENT at the

end of the HALL, looking up to see the silhouetted figures

of ELLIE, with HELEN GREENING in tow.  They look small,

and lost, framed against a floor-to-ceiling window that's

beginning to illuminate with the first light of day.

Heavy with sadness, GARBER turns and heads toward the

women.  Taking a long moment.  MIKE decides not to follow.

CLOSE ON MIKE

CAMERA STAYS AT THIS DISTANCE as the THREESOME comes

together.  We do not hear their words, but sense the

emotion by what WE SEE.  After a brief exchange of words,

GARBER takes HELEN GREENING under his arm, and they MOVE

AWAY -- leaving MIKE and ELLIE alone.

CLOSER ANGLE:  MIKE and ELLIE, gazing at each other across

the gulf of their collective misery.

Nothing left to say; after a long, last look, she turns to

go.  But stops.

The last thing she's going to do is cry.

She TURNS and LEAVES:  MIKE gazing after her.

INT.  SCOTTY'S "BACHELOR PAD" - DAY

MIKE is being shown in by SCOTTY, luggage in hand, SCOTTY

doing his best to be a good "host," under trying

circumstances.

Opening a bedroom door.  They've entered a bedroom that's

sparse, but decorated with A BOY'S PARAPHERNALIA;

skateboard, "rock" posters, etc.  It looks sad and barren.

MIKE stares at the room, his heart too heavy to respond.

SCOTTY, with a pat on the back.

He leaves -- and after a long moment MIKE sits on the edge

of the bed, like an automaton.  Staring.

INT.  CLAIRE'S LIVING ROOM - SAME - DAY

CLAIRE and NEIL in the aftermath.  CLAIRE remains silent,

staring.  Whatever is to be said is his.

NEIL staring at her.

He adverts his gaze, turns, controlling himself, and picks

up his coat to go.

INT.  CLAIRE'S VESTIBULE - SAME - DAY

KOONTZ and a uniformed COP on guard duty.

KOONTZ scanning The Post, which has a front page article

on it with a headline that indicates the whole story has

not "quite" been told:  "INTRUDER SLAIN IN DARING EAST

SIDE BREAK-IN"

The APARTMENT DOOR SWINGS OPEN and NEIL EMERGES.  KOONTZ

and the COP look up, straightening.  KOONTZ folds away the

paper.  But NEIL hardly even acknowledges or notices them,

EXITING.

INT.  CLAIRE'S STUDY - SAME - DAY

The PHONE RINGING -- CAMERA FINDING CLAIRE, looking like a

ghost of her past self -- REACHING FOR THE PHONE.

INT.  SCOTTY'S KITCHEN - SAME - DAY

MIKE on the telephone.

CLAIRE - SAME

She attempts a laugh, trying to keep it "light".

MIKE - SAME

Impacted by it.

CLOSE ONE MIKE:  absorbing it.

CLAIRE - SAME

MIKE - SAME

CLOSE ON MIKE:  beat.

CLAIRE - SAME

Fighting tears; not wanting him to know it.

MIKE hangs up, torn.

CLAIRE - SAME

Hangs up.

EXT.  QUEENS - SAME - DAY

CAMERA PANNING TO REVEAL MIKE, leaning on a CAR, under the

"El" waiting.  HE SPOTS TOMMY, coming around the corner

with his SKATEBOARD under his arm, going into a grocery

store.  MIKE crosses the street as TOMMY comes out of the

store.

TOMMY SPOTS HIM:  hesitant -- slowly approaching the car.

TOMMY is mum:  something dawns on MIKE that sobers him up.

MIKE stops.  His goat is gotten.

TOMMY starts toward the HOUSE.  He's emotional, but

doesn't know how to express it.

HE TURNS AWAY.

ANOTHER ANGLE:  MIKE'S CAR LEAVING.  TOMMY watches it

until it can be seen no longer, then TURNS, going into the

house.

CAMERA PANS SLOWLY -- REVEALING, far down the BLOCK, a

CAR.  VENZA, and ANOTHER MAN (SOSA), are within:

WATCHING.

EXT.  STREET - NIGHT

MIKE pounds it out running on the darkened street.  He

pauses to look up at his dark, empty house as a PATROL CAR

slows to check him out.  He studies them as they pass.

CLOSE ON MIKE:  he gazes after them, then continues to

jog.

INT.  FIRING RANGE - SAME - NIGHT

GUN BLASTS going off in OUR EARS, CAMERA PANNING A LINE of

COPS putting in their PRACTICE HOURS; ENDING ON ELLIE, her

EAR BLOCKERS on, FIRING AWAY.

CLOSE ON TOMMY watching from a booth behind her.

ANGLE ON HER TARGET.  Its balls blasted off.

She comes out.

INT.  CAR - NIGHT

ELLIE in the driver's seat, TOMMY in the back seat.

A LONG BEAT as TOMMY thinks about this.  His attention

switches to a passing McDONALD'S.

INT.  MILTON GREGORY - BANQUET HALL - EVENING

Overhead, chandeliers gleam.  A small orchestra comprised

of STUDENTS of the school plays a variety of tunes.

Mirrors reflect a profusion of flowers, carved gilt and

candlelight.

Gloved service PERSONNEL wait to be of service at the

sides.  The room is quite large yet intimate.  The tables

set perfectly.  GUESTS continue to move toward their

places engaged in animated chatter.

ANOTHER ANGLE:  CLAIRE moving through the crowd,

PLAINCLOTHESMEN flanking her as anonymously as possible

(KOONTZ among them), HER EYES anxious, scanning the crowd.

SHE'S SPOTTED by the PRINCIPAL of the school (GIDDINGS),

who APPROACHES, surprised to see her.

SHE GLANCES around, her "ESCORTS" mistaking it for

anxiety, one of them taking her arm and escorting her in.

INT.  THE BANQUET ROOM - LATER

SPEECHES droning on -- CAMERA FINDING CLAIRE at a round

dinner table, with OTHERS, who think they're engaging her

in conversation; but her thoughts are elsewhere, her eyes

continually glancing toward the doors -- both hoping and

fearing.

INT.  THE BANQUET ROOM - LATER

The SPEECHES have long since ENDED, PEOPLE DANCING, slow

dances to the live orchestra -- CAMERA PANNING to CLAIRE,

sitting in silent isolation at the now sparsely populated

table, having lost hope, feeling utterly alone.  Her chin

is resting in her hand, her eyes fixed sadly on her wine

glass.  PLAINCLOTHESMEN, situated around her, study her

dispassionately.

CLOSE ON HER FACE:  expressionless.  But it slowly gains

animation, as she realizes the MUSIC has changed, made a

segue to something new.  It's "SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME."

SHE LOOKS UP -- to see MIKE; his approach from the

bandstand indicating that the change of music was his

doing.

HER FACE breaks into the most enormous, and grateful,

GRIN.

CLOSE ON MIKE:  returning the smile as he COMES TOWARD.

Uncaring, MIKE MOVES TO CLAIRE.

ANGLE ON BOTH:  gazing at each other.

They TAKE to the FLOOR, she MOVING INTO HIS ARMS.  She

puts her head on his shoulder, then draws back to look at

him, studying his face with the hunger of a woman who

knows it might be for the last time.

CLOSE ON HIM:  studying her saddened eyes.

The conversation is deeply caring; the tone opposite to

the words.

She rests her head on his shoulders again; they continue

to dance.

CLOSE ON HER:  awash in the nearness of him.

He holds her tight -- his eyes EMOTIONAL as they roam the

room --

But HIS EXPRESSION CHANGES as he SPOTS SOMETHING at a far

end of the room.  Near the rear doors.

It's a PLAINCLOTHESMEN, headed purposefully toward KOONTZ,

conferring with him -- both men looking to MIKE, a sense

of bewilderment in their eyes.

ANGLE ON MIKE:  Stopping -- as KOONTZ heads quickly

toward.

MIKE:  Baffled.

Exchanging a quick LOOK with CLAIRE, MIKE heads for the

DOORS; she pauses, heading after.

OUTER LOBBY - SAME

as MIKE BARRELS through doors.

MIKE BREAKS INTO A RUN.

INT.  OFFICE - SAME

as MIKE RACES IN; A PLAINCLOTHESMAN hands him the phone.

INT.  MIKE'S HOUSE - NIGHT - SAME MOMENT

CLOSE ON the RECEIVER of the PHONE:  as JOEY VENZA'S mouth

SPEAKS into it --

The images of ELLIE and TOMMY SEEN, dimly lit, in the

background, petrified; GUARDED by a SECOND MAN (SOSA)

whose figure is shrouded in darkness.

MIKE - SAME

caught in a nightmare.

It goes dead.  MIKE PARALYZED with FEAR.  CLAIRE is

ENTERING, PLAINCLOTHESMAN #1 close to her heels, MIKE'S

breath coming in SHUDDERS as he stares helplessly at her

-- then turns to the PLAINCLOTHESMAN and KOONTZ.

OTHER PLAINCLOTHESMEN are COMING.

MIKE WHIRLS, heedlessly, running for the DOORS, CLAIRE

RACING AFTER HIM.

He RACES OUT THE DOOR:  she in PURSUIT.

PLAINCLOTHESMAN #1 hurries out.

EXT.  MILTON GREGORY SCHOOL - SAME MOMENT - NIGHT

MIKE BOUNDING to his car, CLAIRE hot on his heels.  She

JUMPS into the PASSENGER SEAT, pounding the DOOR LOCK

SHUT.

PLAINCLOTHESMAN #1 REACHES HER, pulling on the DOOR.

MIKE HESITATES.

MIKE hits the ACCELERATOR -- PEELING OUT, leaving

PLAINCLOTHESMAN #1 stranded on the curb.

ANGLE ON COPS:  RACING FOR THEIR CARS -- SCREECHING OUT.

EXT.  STREETS OF QUEENS - SAME - NIGHT

MIKE'S CAR tearing down the STREET -- PURSUED by TWO MORE

SQUAD CARS, one of them not knowing better, GIVING VOICE

TO HIS SIREN!

INT.  MIKE'S CAR - SAME - NIGHT

MIKE'S terrified eyes glancing into the REARVIEW MIRROR.

Luckily, THEY DO.

CLOSE ON CLAIRE:  wide-eyed.  In silence.

She NODS:  terrified.

EXT.  MIKE'S HOUSE - SAME - NIGHT

As MIKE'S CAR COMES TO A SCREECHING HALT, MIKE RUNNING OUT

as CLAIRE DUCKS DOWN.  The house is COMPLETELY DARKENED,

blending in with the night; the PURSUIT CARS CONVERGE as

MIKE makes it to the DOOR, his HANDS TREMBLING as he

FUMBLES with his KEYS... takes a deep breath... and

ENTERS.

INT.  THE HOUSE - SAME - NIGHT

Darkened and pin-drop silent.  They only thing that can be

heard is the SOUND of CAR DOORS slamming outside, as COPS

run into combat positions.

The SOUND of a MUFFLED WHIMPER comes from the kitchen; he

HEADS TOWARD down a narrow HALLWAY.  He falters, ALMOST

STEPPING on a SKATEBOARD.

He's used to the SOUND OF HIS VOICE to mask the slight

"roll" of the SKATEBOARD under his foot:  He's sliding it

into the middle of the doorway.

No answer -- MIKE continues on, girding himself as he

steps into the KITCHEN DOORWAY.  He tries the light-

switch; it doesn't work.  And then a VOICE SPEAKS.  Its

breath, like his, is labored; the VOICE CRACKLING with

tension.

He MOVES to the WINDOW; it's right BESIDE THE TABLE.

VENZA TENSING.

He LIFTS THE WINDOW, CALLING OUT:

EXT.  THE HOUSE - SAME MOMENT - NIGHT

CLAIRE, having shouted from behind a COP CAR:  KOONTZ

grabbing hold of her to keep her in place.

INT.  KITCHEN - SAME MOMENT - NIGHT

VENZA; wary.

EXT.  THE HOUSE - SAME MOMENT

KOONTZ receiving his "message".  Quickly assessing CLAIRE,

he looks to the COPS around him -- then GRITS HIS TEETH

with DECISION.

INT.  THE KITCHEN - SAME - NIGHT

MIKE turns to the window, about to shout.

MIKE YANKS TOMMY under the TABLE, taking HIS PLACE in THE

CHAIR; the COCKED GUN presses up against MIKE'S TEMPLE.

ANGLE ON ELLIE:  Her widened eyes continuing to INDICATE

"beneath the table".

CLOSE ON TOMMY, ON HIS KNEES, his hands tied behind his

back; emitting a whimper of terror.

HE LOOKS UP:  SPOTTING HER GUN, where she'd hidden it for

safe-keeping, TAPED SECURELY, just OVER HIS HEAD.

The FRONT DOOR OPENS -- with a SLOW CREAK -- the FIGURE OF

CLAIRE, her dress silhouetted by the moonlight from

outside, SEEN standing in the front hallway.

ANGLE ON TOMMY:  trying desperately to get his hands, tied

behind his back, within reach of the GUN taped over his

head.  It's impossible.

CLOSE ON MIKE:  eyes darting to ELLIE -- as the FIGURE

slowly APPROACHES down the DARKENED HALL, his HAND

lowering beneath his knees, within reach of TOMMY, under

the TABLE.

ANGLE ON TOMMY:  in a near HEADSTAND, his small hands

managing to TOUCH THE TAPE, his fingernails futilely

attempting to DIG BENEATH IT -- as the FOOTSTEPS continue

to APPROACH down the DARKENED HALL.

ANGLE ON THE FIGURE:  almost at the kitchen door -- about

to STEP INTO THE LIGHT.

TOMMY'S HANDS are on the GUN.

With a sudden SOUND of TAPE "RIPPING" from under the

TABLE.  ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE.  TOMMY ROLLS, THRUSTING THE

GUN INTO MIKE'S HAND as the FIGURE at the DOOR KICKS THE

SKATEBOARD, sending it ZOOMING INTO THE ROOM.  VENZA LEAPS

ASIDE AND FIRES, the FIGURE at the DOOR OPENING FIRE in

RETURN.  MIKE LEAPS FOR ELLIE, knocking her off her CHAIR,

rolling FAST as the ENTIRE KITCHEN ERUPTS IN GUNFIRE.

ANGLE ON ELLIE:  throwing herself OVER TOMMY, BULLETS

"PINGING" AROUND MIKE as he ROLLS, RETURNING THE FIRE.

The pitch-black kitchen shudders with BANGS and FLASHES

like the Fourth of July, mixed with the "WHINE" of bullets

hitting pots and pans, and the sight of BODIES hurtling

through the dark.

The "FIGURE AT THE DOOR" is firing with both hands,

SCORING A HIT ON VENZA'S ACCOMPLICE, who goes down,

wounded, HIS GUN CLATTERING to the FLOOR.  He REACHES for

it, but ELLIE GETS THERE FIRST, grabbing it with her two

hands tied in front of her.

The ACCOMPLICE is staggering upward as ELLIE gets to her

feet, SQUARING OFF in POLICE STANCE -- and FIRES, catching

him square between the SHOULDER BLADES; HE SPINS, crashing

BACKWARDS through the GLASS DOOR -- SWISH-PAN to VENZA,

trying to get out THE KITCHEN WINDOW...

He DOES, BLASTED by MIKE, and the "FIGURE" in the door,

SIMULTANEOUSLY.  He falls out the window, but still has

life in him, staggering to his feet, and hit by SPOTLIGHTS

from the CARS OUTSIDE.  In a sudden barrage, he's hit by

CROSSFIRE, SPINNING, LURCHING -- finally going down.

And then all is quiet.

INSIDE THE KITCHEN -- all sound and movement has suddenly

ceased; everyone is a state of shock.

The overhead LIGHT is SNAPPED ON by the "FIGURE" in the

doorway -- revealing it to be KOONTZ.  In CLAIRE'S DRESS.

Guns in both hands, still smoking.

In the BACKGROUND distant SIRENS are HEARD heading toward.

The SWAT squad.  CAMERA MOVING ACROSS THE FACES OF ELLIE,

TOMMY, MIKE... and KOONTZ; all holding in place.

Listening to them come.

The grim humor of it is registered in SILENCE.  MIKE picks

up VENZA'S HUNTING KNIFE from the floor, cutting through

the ropes that bind TOMMY'S and ELLIE'S HANDS; she PULLS

TOMMY to HER, in a tearful EMBRACE, shielding his face

from the ghastly sight of the man, lying dead, on the

floor.

OTHER PEOPLE are MOVING INWARD, CLAIRE among them, clad in

an OVERSIZED POLICE OVERCOAT -- looking frail and

frightened, SHUDDERING WITH RELIEF when she sees that all

are safe.  But there is no mistaking the presence of

something else in her eyes.

CLOSE ON CLAIRE'S FACE:  gazing at MIKE, his family

wrapped in his protective embrace.  He LOOKS UP, meeting

her eyes.

LONG ANGLE on the ROOM:  dimly illuminated by the single

light, shed from the opened refrigerator door, as people

begin to move -- awakening to life, and its necessary

details, in the aftermath of the crisis.

EXT.  THE HOUSE - SAME

The LAWN virtually FILLED with POLICE VEHICLES, their

revolving red lights illuminating the grim scene; a small

gathering of onlookers gawking from behind police ropes,

AMBULANCES pulling SLOWLY, SILENTLY, away.

CAMERA PANS to two figures ALONE, beside a squad car, in

the distant shadows.  It's CLAIRE, still clad in the

police overcoat, and MIKE.  They are together, but

separate, maintaining the proper distance to say goodbye.

CLOSER ANGLE ON THEM:  not knowing quite what to say.

ANGLE ON BOTH:  their eyes locked into each other's.

CLOSE ON MIKE:  getting her message.

Both are hurting.

Her eyes are glistening; she gives him a bracing smile.

But he can't quiet manage it.

He struggles with it; unable.

Silence now; their eyes adoring.

MIKE TURNS -- CAMERA MOVING WITH HIM as he WALKS SLOWLY

AWAY -- finding himself on a collision course with GARBER.

They meet, spending a long moment in non-communicative

greeting.

MIKE absorbs it, looking up to SEE ELLIE and TOMMY, beside

a SQUAD CAR, a distance away.  Girding himself, he HEADS

TOWARD.

ANGLE ON ELLIE AND TOMMY -- as he APPROACHES, and stands

beside them.  Not much to say.  Finally he reaches out and

tousles TOMMY'S hair.

He catches ELLIE'S eye, both assessing each other.

ANGLE ON ALL:  finding each other's eyes.

MIKE puts an arm AROUND TOMMY -- and the CAMERA BEGINS A

LONG PULLBACK, as ELLIE moves to his side, and the KEEGAN

FAMILY begins to MOVE AWAY.  WE SEE CLAIRE, being helped

into a SQUAD CAR, turning to look back at them as it PULLS

AWAY -- CARS REVVING UP and PULLING OUT, in ALL

DIRECTIONS.

From a distance, we HEAR MIKE'S VOICE.
