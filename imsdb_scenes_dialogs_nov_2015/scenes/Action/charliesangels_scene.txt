CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99

FADE IN:

EXT. THE BIG BLUE SKY - DAY

A VIRGIN AIR 747 bursts through the clouds and levels off.

INT. VIRGIN AIR 747 - DAY

We move through the FIRST CLASS CABIN. It's the regular

mix of first class people: OLD MONEY in Gucci enjoying

freshly baked cookies, a MILLIONAIRE in jeans and a T-

shirt, BUSINESS PEOPLE relaxing after a tough day, and...

...a very nervous MAN.

Shifty-eyed. Alone in an aisle seat, the emergency row.

We hold on him for a moment, but not for too long. Then

we continue moving into --

THE COACH SECTION

Stopping at the lavatory, the "OCCUPIED" sign switches to

"VACANT" and...

JAMES EARL JONES

(or actually, a James Earl Jones type, who for ease of

description, we'll simply refer to as James Earl Jones)

steps out of the restroom, in full African regalia:

multi-colored dashiki, mufti (it's a kind of hat), the

works. He heads up the aisle towards --

THE FIRST CLASS CABIN

Where he is stopped by a --

Mr. Jones now removes a FIRST CLASS TICKET.

She looks at it -- a little confused as to why he's just

handing it to her now -- but then she nods. As he passes:

He continues into the first class cabin and toward --

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                              2.

THE FIRST CLASS EMERGENCY ROOM

Where he slides in past the nervous, shifty-eyed man (his

name is PASQUAL) and sits by the window.

After a moment, Pasqual quietly clears his throat and

leans, slightly, towards Jones.

Now Pasqual nods. Nervously begins to remove something

from his pocket when they are interrupted by --

She hands him the airplane-sized bottle -- he waves off

the glass. She shrugs, leaving...

Pasqual to resume what he was doing. Slowly, he removes

a roll of Certs. He looks to Jones -- "Well? What about

your end of the bargain?"

From within his dashiki, Jones pulls out a black velvet

pouch. He hands it to Pasqual, who opens it to find

diamonds. A helluva lot of diamonds. Pasqual smiles.

He hands the roll of Certs to Jones. It's not breath

candy at all, but a tiny roll of explosives, with a tiny,

high-tech triggering mechanism.

Both men smile.   Pasqual's very relieved that the deal is

done.

Then suddenly, the lights blink out.

Pasqual looks around, nervous. But it's just the in-

flight movie beginning. Clouds, and a woman holding a

torch.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                              3.

CONTINUED:

Columbia Pictures presents... David Spade and Adam

Sandler in "BOSOM BUDDIES: THE MOVIE."

James Earl Jones shakes his head, rolls his eyes.

But James Earl Jones is dead serious.

Jones grabs Pascal in a headlock and turns toward the

back of the plane, shouting:

Now Jones does the unthinkable. Holding Pasqual tight,

he yanks open the emergency door release.

With a RUSH, the cabin decompresses.

Panic erupts as air, paper and everything not belted in

screams out of the open door, including --

EXT. THE BIG BLUE SKY - FALLING AWAY FROM THE 747 - DAY

-- James Earl Jones, still holding Pasqual in a bear hug.

They plummet, wind violently tearing at them. Pasqual's

frantic SCREAMS doppler quite nicely.

DROPPING WITH THEM

They continue to fall, gaining speed. Pasqual is

terrified, but Jones doesn't seem worried. In fact,

casually, he glances at his watch, and then looks --

FAR BELOW THEM - ACROSS THE SKY

At the tiny black speck gradually grows larger in the

distance...

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                               4.

CLOSER - ON THAT BLACK SPECK

It's a jet helicopter. Its door opens, and now a SKYDIVER leaps

out, helmet down, arms back, streaking across the

sky in aerodynamic perfection, heading directly towards

JONES AND PASQUAL

who are still plummeting toward the earth at terminal

velocity. Jones begins to let go of Pasqual, who SCREAMS

and tries to clutch onto him, desperate.

Suddenly -- WHOMMPPPH!! -- the skydiver spread-eagles,

stopping the wild dive directly behind Pasqual, and

immediately binds his arms and straps a parachute on him.

All three are still free-falling.

James Earl Jones nods at the Skydiver who, even under the

helmet and goggles, is clearly a beautiful woman.

Meet ALEXANDRA "ALEX" MUNDAY, one of Charlie's Angels.

She's a sultry bombshell -- a classic femme fatale --

only she's playing for the good guys.

She gives James Earl Jones a wink, then jerks Pasqual's

rip cord and -- WHOOMPH. Pasqual's chute deploys. He

flies upward, leaving --

Alex and James Earl Jones, both still falling.    Below the

ocean screams up at them. Not much time left.

James Earl Jones pulls his belt -- and his mufti flies

up. It's actually a tiny drogue chute, deploying his

entire dashiki. His outfit hides a parachute rig.

Alex pulls her own rip cord and -- WHOOMPH -- her chute

unfurls, and now...

Alex and James Earl Jones gently float towards --

EXT. THE BIG BLUE SEA - DAY

A cigarette boat floats through the choppy water, a

gorgeous young woman expertly throttling up the growling

V-8.

Say hello to NATALIE THOMPSON, Charlie's second angel.

At a glance, she's the brainy-shy girl next door.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                 5.

CONTINUED:

But put her behind the wheel of any vehicle, and she's

unstoppable.

Natalie glances ahead, maneuvering the boat perfectly under

Alex, who drops on deck. Alex gathers her chute, then whips off

her helmet to give her cascading mane a wild shake.

Here comes James Earl Jones. Natalie guns the boat

underneath...a perfect catch. Alex helps him with his

dashiki-chute, and then all three look up...

Here comes Pasqual. Natalie whips the boat around,

catching him as he helplessly drops into the seats, still

bound, still scared out of his wits. He gapes wild-eyed

at the two Angels, then whirls on James Earl Jones.

With that, James Earl Jones reaches up and pulls his face

off. Latex rips free, and standing there (without his

dashiki, James Earl Jones has a great figure) is...

... stunningly beautiful DYLAN SANDERS, angel number

three. She's the wild one.

Pasqual's jaw drops as Dylan shakes her hair free, then

reaches in her mouth --

-- and extracts a voice-modifying chip.

And she pulls from her pocket the airplane-size bottle of

Johnnie Walker Black. She twists it open and downs it.

EXT. BEACH DOCK - DAY

Now, MEN IN "FBI" WINDBREAKERS haul Pasqual away, two of

them carefully handling the certs-explosive. A harmless

fellow pushes his way past them and onto the dock.

It's JOHN BOSLEY, Charlie's lieutenant.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                 6.

CONTINUED:

He reaches the boat, which Natalie ties off while Alex

and Dylan neatly fold their parachutes.

Alex, Natalie and Dylan stroll from the dock onto the sand,

each starting to unzip/unbutton/unsnap their action gear and

hand it to Bosley as they continue walking.

Bosley puffs, proud. He speaks over the ever-growing

pile of chutes, body suits, goggles, the dashiki...

By now, the Angels have stripped off all of their

equipment, revealing eye-popping evening gowns.

The Angels share a laugh as they arrive in their sassy

duds at a private beach club, where a WAITER greets them

with a tray of champagne flutes.

They each take a glass, turn to each other and raise

them. Another Angels Mystery... Case Closed.

FREEZE FRAME.    And the TITLE SEQUENCE BEGINS...

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                               7.

CONTINUED:

THREE FOURTH GRADE SCHOOL PHOTOS FILL THE FRAME, side by

side by side. These are three very different girls.

NATALIE, with a page-boy cut and wearing a Catholic

schoolgirl's uniform, sports glasses and braces; a bit

awkward and gangly, even shy.

ALEX, formally dressed with perfect pig-tails, is

sophisticated and self-possessed; a class act, even at ten.

DYLAN, wild blond hair and faded T-shirt, has a jaded,

street-wise smirk; even at this young age, her isolation

and disillusionment are masked by seeming confidence.

The triptych remains on screen.    Now it shifts into:

VIDEO TAPE - THE THREE GIRLS (STILL IN TRIPTYCH)

Now TEENAGERS, on HOME VIDEO.

NATALIE, working the A-V equipment at school, hides her

face in embarrassment, uncomfortable with the camera.

FREEZE.

ALEX, in riding gear, accepting her steeple-chase trophy.

She knows where to look for the camera. FREEZE.

DYLAN, smoking with her tough-girl friends in the girls'

room of her reform school, is caught on camera. She

flips it off. FREEZE.

TRIPTYCH CONTINUES

They're all WOMEN now, in their early twenties.

NATALIE, a research fellow at MIT (and beautiful, but not

flaunting it) demonstrates a chess-playing computer

program to a room of impressed advisors.

ALEX, valedictorian at Oxford, passionately delivers her

address to a crowd of rapt students, faculty and parents.

DYLAN, in leather and a helmet, steps off a Harley. She

sees a punk with a mohawk slapping around his girlfriend.

She decks him, then enters the back door of a seedy punk bar.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                              8.

TRIPTYCH ENDS

With photographs again. The women, as they are now:

Natalie, Alex, Dylan. All gorgeous, all self-assured.

Now, FIREBALL EXPLOSIONS completely fill the screen.

ANGEL SILHOUETTES appear, in flames.    New MUSIC kicks in.

...And a new title sequence takes over:

VARIOUS SHOTS:   MONTAGE (OVER MUSIC)

Credits continue as we watch the Angels in action (from,

presumably, previous adventures...)

-- A microscope-peering Natalie cuts a ruby, drops it in

a laser housing, shoots a red beam.

--   Dylan, wielding kendo sticks, spars with two Yakzuza.

-- Alex side-kicks two baddies, spins, drops a third.

ZOOM BACK: she is at the Parthenon.

-- A motocross race. Natalie digs in for the finish,

attacking the last jump with gusto.

-- Dylan, in traditional Islamic robes, finds a secret

switch. She pushes back a bookcase to reveal secret stairs.

-- At a ballroom dance competition, Alex wows the crowd

while keeping her eye on a nefarious couple.

-- Bosley, as "Luka, the Bad Ass Pimp," bitch-slaps a

couple of "ho's" -- actually Dylan and Alex -- then winks

at them as unsuspecting drug dealers back off, scared.

--   Natalie bites into a messy hot-dog, has to just laugh.

-- The three angels elbow their way through a roller-

derby match.

-- In orange prison jumpsuits, Alex and Dylan work in

female chain-gang.

-- Window-washer Natalie peers into a skyscraper office,

surreptitiously photographing the meeting inside.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                              9.

CONTINUED:

-- On an Italian street, the three Angels buy a paper,

grin at the headline, "Mystery Women Save European

Union." As they high-five, Dylan's cone of gelato drops

to the sidewalk. The Angels look at it, look at each

other...and just have to laugh.

TITLE SEQUENCE ENDS.

OVER BLACK we hear a DIGITAL RING...

INT. TINY HOUSEBOAT BEDROOM - DAY

CLOSE ON Dylan as she wakes up in a tangle of ugly

sheets, disoriented and a bit hungover. She hears the

RINGING -- where is it coming from? Why is it drilling

into her head?

Checking the floor, she finds her jeans. Digs in the

pocket to find her cell phone. Answering...

She clicks the phone off, then starts looking around.

Where the fuck is she?

From the next room, we hear a male VOICE singing "My

Sharona." She checks under the sheets. Oh God. She's

naked. She pulls her shirt from the floor, puts it on.

Closing her eyes, she prays...

At the door, skinny shirtless CHAD holds a skillet of eggs.

EXT. CHAD'S CRAPPY BOAT - DAY

Blinded by the daylight, Dylan emerges from below,

relieved to see the boat is docked. Chad follows her

outside, pleading...

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                   10.

CONTINUED:

She jumps onto the dock.

Dylan just keeps walking.

CLOSEUP - MAN'S FACE

This is Jason Gibbons, handsome, action-movie stud.       He's

concentrating fiercely.

A bead of sweat drops down Jason's face.

REVEAL ALEX, her face right next to his.

He makes a "snip" motion.     They both breathe a sigh of relief.

She leans forward, closer and closer, right in his face.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                      11.

CONTINUED:

Alex kisses him. It's a damn good kiss.          Jason's into

it, but pulls away for a second.

Pull back to reveal...

ALEX and JASON are in a fully macked out Airstream,

sitting on a bed, leaning over an open screenplay. We

can tell from our surroundings that Jason is a big deal

Hollywood action star, and this trailer is his home away

from home.

She licks the bridge of his nose, then kisses him again.

As she smiLes, a cell phone RINGS. Both Alex and Jason

reach for their phones. It's hers.

EXT. JASON'S AIRSTREAM - DAY

Jason stands in the doorway in his robe as Alex tosses

her stuff in the back of a very excellent car.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                  12.

CONTINUED:

Alex looks back -- that was more personally revealing

than she expected.

A P.A. comes up next to Jason.

Jason nods, then back to Alex.

Alex smiles at the irony of that.

She blows him a kiss and speeds off.

EXT. BEACH APARTMENT WALKWAY - DAY

Natalie KNOCKS on the door to 113.      A beat later, the

door swings open to reveal BOB.

Natalie SCREAMS in astonishment.

She pushes past him.

INT. BOB'S APARTMENT - DAY

Natalie makes a beeline for his keys on the table.

Starts taking one key off the ring.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                     13.

CONTINUED:

He has no idea what she's talking about.         She goes to

THE BATHROOM,

where she retrieves a toothbrush.

Her cell phone RINGS.

She holds up a finger, just a sec.

She hangs up.

ANGLE ON Bob.    What can he say?

Behind Natalie, a door opens.          A topless BLONDE looks out.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                   14.

CONTINUED:

Behind the Blonde, ISAAC HAYES looks out.      He's also topless.

Beyond weirded out, Natalie just leaves.

EXT. SUNSET BOULEVARD - DAY

Passing cars reveal the one and only CHARLES TOWNSEND

DETECTIVE AGENCY. That's what the sign says.

INT. CHARLES TOWNSEND DETECTIVE AGENCY - DAY

In foreground, a blender WHIRRS. Still hungover, Dylan

cringes from the sound. Natalie pours out three fruit

smoothies for the angels.

She and Natalie toast.       Alex is only half-in. Off their look...

Bosley walks in with a folder.       He eyes their drinks.

It's not okay, but that's our Bosley. He takes his seat

behind his desk. Now we see the biggest addition to the

office, the Angels Wall of Fame.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                              15.

CONTINUED:

Pictures of every angel, from the original cast members to some

fictitious ones we've never seen before. The rest of the office

is exactly as we remember it, right down to the

SPEAKERPHONE.

The angels take a seat on couches and chairs.

As he's talking, the far blinds close themselves. A white

screen lowers from the ceiling, ready to catch the

projected VIDEO:

A handsome MAN IN HIS 20'S in a CNN profile. The sound is

muted, be we see him attending a gala; in an office surrounded

by computers; rock climbing; smiling in a sit-down interview.

Oops, did Bosley say that out loud?

ON VIDEO: Surveillance camera footage of a parking

garage. Two MEN IN HOODS shove Knox into black car.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                               16.

CONTINUED:

A striking WOMAN IN A SUIT stands in the doorway.

She seems to direct this next sentence right to Natalie.

Bosley is excited to hear his name mentioned.

ON VIDEO: Roger Corwin. He's an unpleasant-looking man,

who's even nastier when he tries to smile. We see logos

for his company, Red Star Systems

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                   17.

CONTINUED:

CHARLIE'S POV

We see his chalky fingers grabbing into a hand hold.

We're halfway up the face of Yosemite's El Capitan -- the

ground is hundreds of feet below.

Two beautiful and buxomly CLIMBING BUDDIES smile at him.

EXT. PALM SPRINGS SPA - DAY

Establishing...

EXT. SPA DECK / OUTSIDE WALKWAY - DAY

Built into the Palm Springs Hills, this very exclusive

spa has a fantastic view of the desert.

Dressed in a crisp spa uniform, Alex has a sidebar with a

white-robed Bosley. She shows him a tiny electronic

device shaped like a bullet.

Alex takes a plastic cup, drops the transmitter into it.

Covers it over with ice chips from a nearby bucket.

Bosley nods, clever.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                  18.

CONTINUED:

She points him in the direction of the men's spa.    But he's

frozen with excitement.

INT. MEN'S STEAM ROOM - DAY

A burst of steam clears, revealing Bosley. He waddles forward

in his shower clogs, which SQUISH with every step. He's wearing

two towels: one around his waist, and a second around his

chest.

As more steam dissipates, we see there    are SEVEN MEN sitting on

the risers. Six are gorgeous, ranging     from Calvin Klein models

to Marlboro Men. Bosley looks around,     taking a keen interest.

Maybe he's checking them out, maybe he    isn't. We just don't

know.

The seventh man is ROGER CORWIN, who we recognize from

the videotape. He's leaning forward, a gold chain

dangling. It's beside him that Bosley takes a seat.

He sets the ice cup -- and the transmitter -- in a

strategic location.

Noticing that none of the other men have towels around

their bosoms, Bosley nervously undoes his, revealing skin

the color of cooked salmon. He fluffs up his sparse chest hair,

then decides to smush it back down.

He tries to make eye contact with Corwin, working way too

hard. Annoyed, Corwin finally looks over.

Corwin shakes his head, idiot.

Yes, he said "pubic." He's about to correct himself when

a very hot guy across from him moves his towel to wipe off

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                19.

CONTINUED:

some sweat. We don't see the promised land, but Bosley

does. It flusters him.

He sees another guy eating ice chips. Good idea.      Bosley

does the same. He eats another. And another.

Corwin seems wary, but Bosley is clearly harmless.

Corwin bristles at the mention.

The door opens, a rush of steam. ADONIS HIMSELF enters.

Picking a seat behind Bosley, he pulls off his towel as

he passes. We just see a bit of ass, but Bosley is face-

to-face with the babymaker.

One ice chip is not going to do it.    He chugs the rest of

his cup, including

THE TRANSMITTER

which BLEEPS.    Corwin and others look over.    What the hell

was that?

The device still in his mouth, Bosley has no choice but to

smile and swallow. His eyes go wide as he chokes it down.

Corwin gets up to leave.

Another BLEEP. He shuts his mouth tight. Smiles. Rubs

his chest a bit, trying to get the transmitter down.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                               20.

INT. PRIVATE MASSAGE ROOM - DAY

Corwin walks into a lushly-appointed private massage

room. A masseuse dressed in a skimpy robe, her back to

us, oils up her hands sensuously near the window.

Corwin gets under the sheet, on his stomach. The

masseuse turns around, and now we see that it's Alex.

Alex starts to work on his back. She is clearly an

expert at this. This is a legit place, but there's

something undeniably sensual about the whole experience.

Under the table, we look up to see Corwin's face in the

cradle. He's in a tortured rapture.

Alex works along Corwin's back and neck.   She pulls his

arms out to the side.

Corwin goes limp.

Confident Corwin is out cold, she slides the key strap

off his wrist.

INT. EXECUTIVE LOCKER ROOM - DAY

Making sure she's alone, Alex uses the key to open a

locker. She carefully sorts through Corwin's things,

finding his Palm Pilot organizer. She clicks it into a

special device, which BLIPS as it downloads all his

information.

Putting the Palm Pilot away, she shuts the locker.

INT. MASSAGE ROOM - DAY

CLOSE ON Corwin as he suddenly wakes up, disoriented.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                   21.

CONTINUED:

Just when we think Alex's plan has failed, we TILT UP to

see Alex is right there. She's massaging him.

A beat. Yeah, he must have.     A patented ANGELS FLIP

leads us to...

INT. NATALIE'S EXCELLENT CONVERTIBLE - DAY

The Angels are all in the car together, cruising down

Sunset Boulevard. Dylan drives, Alex in the passenger seat,

Natalie in the back seat with her computer on her lap.

She pulls into an In N' Out Burger, right up to the drive thru.

While they wait for their order, Natalie punches

something up on her computer.

ONSCREEN -- we see a list of all Corwin's plans for the

next week. Two events in particular stand out:

Dylan glances over the schedule.

The food comes, Dylan takes it.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                    22.

CONTINUED:

Natalie goes back to the computer again, slipping a CD

into the drive. Dylan hands out the food, spilling a lot

of it. A big glop of chocolate shake lands on the

keyboard.

Natalie licks the shake off her fingers, tapes away at

the keyboard.

On screen, the footage downloads from the CD, into the

program. Natalie fast forwards through it until she

comes to a shot of one of the kidnappers where his mask

is partly pulled away from his face.

The program zooms in on the revealed part of his face,

then runs a series of calculations. A new drawing starts

to appear.

Natalie's portable printer spits out a simulated

composite of one skinny, bad-looking dude. Dylan grabs

it, looks it over.

She hands it to Alex to inspect.

She turns the composite around, revealing that Dylan has

smudged his head with ketchup.

They all just have to laugh.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                  23.

INT. BILTMORE BALLROOM - DAY

A sophisticated reception is in full swing, an ocean of

smart suits and power ties.

Dressed as a catering waitress, Natalie carries a tray of

hors d'oeuvres. MOVING WITH her, we pass ROGER CORWIN, who

talks with another suit, and further on, a conservatively-

dressed DYLAN who chats up a group of WALL STREET TYPES.

A few nods.    She makes a good point.

On Dylan.    Shit.     She tries to stall...

ACROSS THE ROOM

Still walking, Natalie talks to no one...

BACK WITH DYLAN

More nods, ad-libbed agreement.        The Broker Guy is impressed.

Excusing herself, Dylan turns and subtly touches her ear,

where she's wearing a hidden radio.

AT THE BAR

Natalie loads champagne flutes onto her tray.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                     24.

CONTINUED:

She looks up to see a very cute bartender, PETE (26).

She didn't realize he was so close.

Oh God.   What did she just say?       But he smiles anyway.

She heads back out into the crowd.       You can almost see

the big L on her forehead.

BY THE FOUNTAIN

Dylan has been watching this.        We INTERCUT between her

and Natalie.

Natalie walks past Dylan, not acknowledging her.        Dylan

snaps her fingers.

Natalie comes back, a little annoyed. Dylan takes a

glass for herself, then foists the other glasses on

everyone around her, whether they wanted it or not.

She nudges Natalie in that direction.

AT THE BAR

We TILT UP from a Japanese comic book to Pete.       He

suddenly realizes Natalie is waiting for him.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                  25.

CONTINUED:

He starts filling more flutes.

He holds it up.

Imagine that.    Natalie takes her tray and reluctantly

heads off.

ON DYLAN

ON NATALIE

She turns and heads back.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                26.

CONTINUED:

ON DYLAN

She smiles, hearing the deal close. Pushing through a

cluster of investors, she bumps into a THIN MAN.

He doesn't respond, but something about this man raises

her suspicions. Where has she seen him before? As he

moves out of earshot...

ON NATALIE

Spotting the Thin Man, she heads his way.

He waves her away, no. Oops, she drops a napkin in front

of him. She kneels down to get it.

As we move in VERY CLOSE ON her tray, we see that there's

a tiny Digital display. A metal detector is built into

the rim.

It BLIPS as she moves past his ankle. And again as she

rises up past his chest. The man just keeps walking.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

The Thin Man is headed down the hall.    Looking back, we

see Dylan enter from the ballroom.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                 27.

CONTINUED:

He doesn't turn back.

The man takes a sudden right into a service hallway.

She slips off her heels to give chase.

INT. SERVICE HALLWAY - DAY

The Thin Man comes around the corner.       We stay TIGHT on

him, until he suddenly stops.

NATALIE

has come around from the other side. His bad guy instincts

tell him these women are working together. He's boxed in.

And then, a DING!

Elevator doors open beside him. He looks in to see the clue-

less BELLBOY, who had a funky groove going on his headphones.

In a single motion, the Thin Man yanks the guy out into the

hallway and takes his place. Hits the button.

From opposite directions, Natalie and Dylan run to the

elevator, but the doors have already shut. Checking the

panel.

They take the stairs.

INT. BASEMENT SERVICE HALLWAY - DAY

Natalie and Dylan emerge from the staircase to find the

elevator empty. To the left, exit doors swing tellingly.

EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - DAY

Nat and Dylan smash through the exit doors and out into

the sun-drenched streets of beautiful, downtown Los

Angeles. Natalie immediately spots the Thin Man, booking

down the alley.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                 28.

CONTINUED:

And they take off after him.

What ensues is the fastest, wildest, two chicks and one

guy foot chase you've ever seen. Here are some highlights:

-- Thin Man pulls himself, clumsily, over a chain link

fence. Dylan and Natalie pull an old Jackie Chan trick

and run up the side wall and hop over easily.

-- Thin Man, still on foot, waits for traffic to slow,

then darts across the Harbor Freeway. By the time Dylan

and Natalie get there, traffic is roaring again.

Undeterred, they make their way through, tucking and

rolling under the wheels of a moving semi.

-- Dylan is racing down an alley, when a car comes barrelling

at her. She leaps up onto the hood of the car as it drives

underneath her, a la one of those That's Incredible! stunts.

-- They chase the Thin Man into an industrial laundromat.

The scene goes something like this:

INT. INDUSTRIAL LAUNDRY ROOM

Thunderously LOUD, with industrial washers and dryers operating

at full tilt. Natalie and Dylan are just entering when

THREE SHOTS

ring out.    They dive for cover behind a massive washer

assembly.

ANGLE ON the Thin Man, planning his next move. With no

good shot at the angels, he aims high, both guns BLAZING.

He shots out the pipes over their heads, sending down a

cascade of hot water.

Dylan and Natalie scramble back to avoid getting scalded.

Other pipes SHATTER from the change in pressure, leading

to an interior thunderstorm. Steam fills the room as an

inch of water grows on the floor.

Natalie and Dylan push rolling laundry carts in the Thin

Man's direction. He shoots at them, but quickly realizes

they're just trying to waste his bullets.

Holstering one of his guns, he dials his cell phone.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                    29.

CONTINUED:

On the far wall, Natalie switches on the overhead hooks,

which circle on a wire like a ski lift. The Thin Man

looks up, distracted, not noticing --

DYLAN

As she creeps up behind the cover of the rolling laundry

carts. She's succeeded in circling behind the Thin Man

as he talks on the phone.

She clears her throat.      The Thin Man turns.   She kicks

him in the jaw.

Knocked back, he drops the phone, which CRACKS and slips

under a washing machine.

He crab-walks back, then suddenly springs back to his feet.

We weren't expecting that kind of ninja move out of this guy.

HE TURNS TO SEE

NATALIE

right behind him. With a coiled towel, she grabs his gun

arm and expertly flips him. But he reacts smoothly, rolling

over to charge at Natalie, picking her up like a sack of

potatoes. As he does, he grabs her right in the tit.

Before she can finish her sentence, the Thin Man throws

Natalie at Dylan, knocking them both down. He jumps up,

and with a single motion grabs an overhead pipe and kicks

another, releasing a wall of steam -- we can't see a thing.

By the time the fog clears, the Thin Man is long gone.

Lying down in the water, Dylan reaches under the washer

to fish out the Thin Man's busted cell phone.

INT. TOWNSEND AGENCY BACK ROOM - DAY

Natalie sits at a glowing computer monitor, the Thin

Man's cell phone connected by a data cable to the

Townsend Agency computers. Rapidly touching the screen,

she calls up a list of the last thirty-five phone calls

he received. They're all from the same location.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                   30.

CONTINUED:

She points to some code next to the numbers.

As she says it...

EXT. ASPEN - NIGHT

The sign says it:     Welcome to Aspen.

VARIOUS ESTABLISHING SHOTS of the gorgeous mountain town,

still somehow quaint despite its astonishing wealth.

EXT. COWBOY BAR -- NIGHT

A rowdy establishment just outside of town.

INT. COWBOY BAR --     CONTINUOUS

The kind of place that rich weekend skiers don't come.

Lots of over-aggressive, cowboy-biker types, drinking more

than they should. There are only a few women in the place,

and they are either waitresses or biker chicks. Suddenly,

everyone stops what they're doing and turns to the door.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS have entered the room. Dressed in their

stylish ensembles, they couldn't possibly look more out of

place.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                 31.

CONTINUED:

She points to a door at the back of the bar that leads

into a glassed-in office. Two, beefy bouncer types are guarding

the door.

Dylan and Natalie smile at each other.

The Three Angels split up, Bosley tagging along with Dylan.

DYLAN

sidles up to the bar. A group of three rednecks are

downing shots, one after another.

The rednecks stare at Dylan, drooling.       Dylan turns to the first

one.

Bosley tries to make himself small.

The three rednecks hoot and holler.

BY THE MECHANICAL BULL

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                  32.

CONTINUED:

A group of wanna bes are waiting their turn at the

mechanical bull. Natalie wanders over behind them.

The crowd parts for her, and Natalie hops up on the bull.

She cranks it up, and lets

BY THE BAR --

Dylan downs a shot, slams it on the table.      Countless

other glasses surround her.

REVEAL that two of the rednecks are down for the count, one

falling out of his chair, the other passed out on the table.

The third redneck is slurring badly, trying to keep up

with Dylan.

The redneck nods, lifts up his chair and heaves it across

the bar.

OKAY, HERE'S AN OUTLINE OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE REST OF

THIS SCENE:

Dylan and Natalie create a distraction, while Alex sneaks

into the back office with Bosley to get the phone number

of the chalet.

EXT. HIGH MOUNTAIN ROAD - NIGHT

A VW van climbs the winding road.       As we get closer, we see the

side reads, "Chalet Grams."

A DING-DONG DING-DING-DONG doorbell rings.

INT. MOUNTAIN HOUSE / GREAT ROOM - NIGHT

TWO THUGS with shoulder holsters look up, hearing the bell.

One was tending to the fire.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                              33.

CONTINUED:

Thug Two shakes his head.

Checking his gun, Thug One grabs for his windbreaker.

Puts it on over.

EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

Thug One opens the door to find Dylan and Natalie dressed

in Swiss Miss outfits, complete with blonde braids.

The girls lean in and hug each other, butts sticking out.

To the left, Bosley starts playing oommpa OOMMPA oommpa

OOMMPA on a wrap-around tuba. He's wearing lederhosen,

with a feather in his hat.

Natalie begins to YODEL.

Dylan hands a fancy envelope to the bewildered thug. Thug

Two is approaching from behind, curious what the hell is

going on.

Dylan begins to TALK-SING a song in German about a too-

curious goat and his worried mistress. Even with the pantomime,

we have no idea what's happening. It seems

wholesome, but occasionally one of the girls touches the

other in a weirdly coquettish, oddly sexual way.

Thug Two looks at the address on the envelope.

As the angels continue their routine, the CAMERA RISES,

three quick cuts to take us to...

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                               34.

EXT. THE ROOF - NIGHT

... where a black cat-suited Alex stands at the

chimney... A ribbon of smoke curls from the stack.

Pulling the pin from a canister, she drops it down the

chimney.

INT. MOUNTAIN HOUSE GREAT ROOM - NIGHT

A cheerful fire burns in the over-sized fireplace. The

canister drops into the flames from above, suddenly

venting a HISSING cloud of halon gas. The fire dies

immediately, the logs covered with a violent frost.

INT. THE CHIMNEY - NIGHT

Alex doesn't even need a rope. Her feet pressed to the

sooty walls, she expertly slides to the bottom.

INT. GREAT ROOM - NIGHT

Alex backs out of the fireplace to find a WAITING BAD GUY

swinging

A FIREPLACE POKER

at her head. She ducks just in time.     The poker CHINGS

against the stone, making a spark.

Rolling, jumping and diving, Alex scurries as Pokerman

slashes and stabs. She ducks behind a chair, which

Pokerman catches with the hook, winging it across the

room.

Backed against the wall, Alex yanks on the heavy

curtains, pulling them down, along with the wooden

curtain rod. A spin, a flourish of velvet and the

curtain rings drop off to leave her with a trusty

quarterstaff.

She goes on the offensive.    Thrust, parry, spin.

But he's a worthy adversary. One good karate kick breaks

her staff in two. She uses both pieces to club him in

the knees, then rolls back to the fireplace.

She grabs the remaining tool: the fireplace tongs.

Pokerman swings. Alex catches his weapon in the tong

scissors, yanking it free with such force the point sticks

in the wall.

A quick kick knocks Pokerman to the floor, where Alex

rolls on top of him. She catches his head in the tongs,

squeezing his temples. His eyes bulge.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                  35.

INT. WINDOWLESS ROOM - NIGHT

Young billionaire ERIC KNOX paces. He's grungy, with

two days of stubble, but still a darn attractive guy.

Hearing a KICK at the door, he turns.

A second KICK blows the door open.     It's Alex.

EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

Bosley is about to hyper-ventilate on the tuba, sweaty

and a little blue.

Dylan and Natalie's new song has them sharing the saddle

of an imaginary horse. When Dylan reaches back to slap

the "horse," she hits Natalie in the rump. Both women

tee-hee.

The thugs think it's pretty hot.

Dylan whispers a secret to Natalie.     Natalie WHISPERS

back.

Turning to the thugs, they each lean in to WHISPER into

a different thug's ear. As the men smile, the angels

suddenly BONK the two men's heads together. Both men

fall, knocked out.

Stepping over the bodies, Dylan heads inside.

INT. MOUNTAIN HOUSE HALLWAY - NIGHT

Looking for the way out, Alex leads Knox to a closed

door. She opens it to find...

INT. TV ROOM - NIGHT

... TWO MORE THUGS sitting in front the big-screen TV,

watching a college basketball game (Duke vs. Maryland,

in case you care.) The guards look back, spotting Alex

with Knox.

That wouldn't be so bad, if it weren't for the

FIFTEEN OTHER THUGS

watching the game with them.

ANGLE ON Alex.   It's an oh-shit moment.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                   36.

CONTINUED:

The thugs are out of their seats a moment later, each of

them pulling out a firearm.

EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

Holding down three keys on the tuba, Bosley talks into

the mouthpiece. It has a secret radio.

INT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT

Running, Alex pushes Knox ahead of her, checking their

backs. She talks into a wrist-mic.

Another THUG steps out in front of her.      She kicks him

down the steps.

Reaching the bottom of the steps, Knox is surprised to be

grabbed by Dylan.

At this point, he'll do whatever they say.

EXT. FRONT OF MOUNTAIN HOUSE - NIGHT

Dylan rushes Knox across the driveway to the waiting van

-- Natalie is pulling it around. Overhead, bright

security lights switch on.

Back at the front door, Alex pulls it shut. She attaches

a carabiner clip to the handle, running a thin steel cord

from it around the porch column.

INT. FOYER - NIGHT

The first of the thugs reaches the door, tries to pull it

open but can't. The next few guards try to help him,

while the rest start smashing through the windows.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                               37.

EXT. FRONT OF MOUNTAIN HOUSE - NIGHT

Running with the tuba, Bosley stops for a moment to catch

his breath, hands on his knees. Okay, ready to run

again.

He's the last to be pulled into the van.    A spray of

gravel and they're off.

INT. THE VAN - NIGHT

Everyone is piled on top of each other. Dylan and Knox

have a few awkward moments as they get untangled. Bosley

keeps making inappropriate TUBA NOISES.

At the wheel, Natalie is fierce and focused, in total

control.

Looking out the back windows, Alex sees the kidnappers

piling into jeeps to give chase. From the side of the

house, more thugs appear on motorbikes.

Everyone's attention WHIPS FORWARD to see the headlights of

GIANT LOGGING TRUCK

coming up the high mountain road. It straddles the

center line, blocking both directions. There's no way

around it.

No, it wouldn't.   Then --

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                   38.

CONTINUED:

She points to a faded "CLOSED" sign that hangs from a

chain. In the darkness, who knows what it's blocking.

But as we hear the THUNDEROUS HORN from the oncoming

truck, we know there's no choice.

Natalie cuts a hard right, SMASHING through the sign.

The van THUMPS AND BUMPS its way across the low grass,

its headlights only showing ten feet ahead. At any

moment, the ground could stop in a cliff.

Like now.

The van leaps into empty space.      Tires spin, helpless.

The van falls.

Everyone SCREAMS.    Bosley is the loudest.

And then, touchdown. The van hits the ground, hard but

not catastrophically. Natalie hits the brakes, cuts the

wheel hard to avoid hitting

A CONCRETE WALL

in front of them.    Everyone takes a beat to acknowledge

they're alive.

Suddenly, a BRIGHT LIGHT goes on overhead.

EXT. THE MOUNTAIN - NIGHT

One by one, a series of arc lights switches on, forming a

snake all the way to the bottom of the mountain.

INT. THE VAN - NIGHT

Looking out the back windows...

They're facing backwards.

Up ahead, the kidnappers are charging down the access roads.

The first of two jeeps makes the jump into the bobsled chute.

Throwing it into reverse, Natalie peels out.

The jeeps follow.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                               39.

EXT. BOBSLED RUN - NIGHT

The VW Van leads the way down the mountain, tail-first.

As it builds speed, it starts to climb the wall, each turn

getting steeper and steeper.

The two jeeps are following. Facing the right direction,

they have a much easier time of it.

INT. VAN - NIGHT

Everything is shaking so violently, it looks like a NASA launch.

Natalie makes the turn. The van rises up, nearly tilting

over. But they make it through the turn.

A beat.   He smiles at her.   He has a nice smile.

EXT. BOBSLED RUN - NIGHT

One of the jeeps makes a move, closing the distance to

the van. A RIFLEMAN leans out the passenger window,

lining up a shot. He FIRES.

INT. THE VAN - NIGHT

The shot blasts cleanly through the top of the windshield,

through the horn of Bosley's tuba, then out the back window.   It

missed hitting somebody by millimeters.

Natalie is still focused, making each turn as Alex calls it.

EXT. BOBSLED RUN - NIGHT`

The front jeep gets even more aggressive, building speed.

It hits the next turn too fast, rising up too high along

the wall. It tips further, and further, finally rolling

over onto its back. It SCRAPES across the concrete, a

shower of sparks as it slows down.

With nowhere to go, the second jeep brakes hard, but can't stop.

It SMASHES into the first jeep, a tangle of steel.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                              40.

CONTINUED:

The combined mass continues sliding down the run, like a

jagged pinball in the chute.

INT. THE VAN - NIGHT

Dylan looks out through the windshield as the jeep combo recedes

farther and farther away.

Just then, two MOTORBIKES race up along the chute walls, passing

the crippled jeeps. Two more MOTORBIKES jump in from above.

Suddenly, Natalie GASPS, remembering something.

WHIP CUT TO:

EXT. EGYPTIAN THEATRE - NIGHT

A dejected Pete stands in front of the sign for the anime

festival, two tickets in hand.

WHIP BACK TO:

INT. THE VAN - NIGHT

Natalie makes the hard right. The motorcycles are gaining on

them, but Natalie and Dylan have to talk through this first.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                  41.

CONTINUED:

She makes the left.

One motorcycle charges, coming up just feet from the

windshield. Natalie taps on the brakes. The freaked out

guy can't slow down in time. He SMACKS into the windshield,

then goes flying.

Indeed, we are. The concrete walls end, leaving open ground.

Slamming on the brakes, Natalie turns the van around.

Everyone goes flying. Bosley is still on the phone with

Charlie.

EXT. BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN - NIGHT

Back facing the right direction, the van charges onward.

The motorcycles race up to the passenger side, grabbing

for the door.

INT. THE VAN - NIGHT

Dylan SLAMS open the door, knocking one RIDER off.

The sliding door opens, another RIDER outside trying to get

in. Thinking fast, Knox grabs Bosley's tuba and shoves it

at the motorcyclist, who tumbles, taking out the fourth

rider in the process.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                42.

HELICOPTER

thunders over.    We are...

INT. THE HELICOPTER - NIGHT

Natalie is at the controls, Bosley beside her.      Alex leans

forward from the second row.

Natalie pats him on the arm. She and Alex exchange a quick

glance. They have to just laugh.

In the back row, Knox is looking out over the gorgeous lights

of Aspen.

She offers him an airplane-sized bottle of Johnnie Walker

black. He takes it and toasts. They both down their drinks

in a single shot. A smile, and then...

MUSIC rises.

THE ANGELS TRIPTYCH descends.

The act is over.    After a beat, we

WIPE TO REVEAL:

EXT. CHARLES TOWNSEND DETECTIVE AGENCY - DAY

Re-establishing.

INT. CHARLES TOWNSEND DETECTIVE AGENCY - (THE NEXT) DAY

Charlie is on the speakerphone.      The angels are in their

usual lounging positions.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                 43.

CONTINUED:

Natalie grins a guilty smile.

Knox enters. Clean-shaven and neatly pressed, he's still a

darn good-looking man. Vivian Wu follows him.

He's talking to all the angels, but his gaze seems to fall

most upon Dylan. She notices it.

CIRCLING AROUND, we see the video images of Corwin and the

Red Star Systems logo on the big screen.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                 44.

CONTINUED:

A video image of Corwin's Palm Pilot Schedule comes up the

bigscreen. The shot pulls in close on "SAN DIEGO SPEEDWAY."

UNDERWATER

From Charlie's P.O.V., looking up at the sunlight.      Three

manta-rays swim above us.

We can hear the BUBBLES from Charlie's regulator.

A manta-ray swims past, super-close, letting us...

EXT. KNOX HOUSE - DUSK

A majestic craftsman in the hills, Frank Lloyd Wright meets

conspicuous consumption.

INT. KNOX HOUSE ATTIC - DUSK

A flashlight beam sweeps past, revealing Dylan. With just

her shoulders above the rafters, she's checking a dusty

crawl space. She finds nothing suspicious.

INT. KNOX'S WALK-IN CLOSET - DUSK

Knox stands below, Dylan's boots on his shoulders. The heels

dig in a bit, but he's not complaining.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                45.

CONTINUED:

He moves to help her down, but she does a reverse-pullup to

handle it by herself. She leads the way...

INT. KNOX'S BEDROOM - DUSK

The room is huge. Through the floor-to-ceiling windows, we see

that we're up in the hills.

Knox follows her as she walks.

We continue...

INT. KNOX LIVING ROOM - DUSK

Just as big, just as beautiful. Knox, or his decorator, has

great taste. Everything is top quality, but unpretentious.

She takes a marker-sized device off the table.

She takes her jacket off the couch, ready to go.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                 46.

CONTINUED:

He tosses her the panic button.

Dylan is surprised by this.

Dylan looks him over. Normally, she'd be suspicious, but

the guy WAS just kidnapped, and he seems sincere.

She smiles.

She throws her coat back on the sofa.

INT. KNOX LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

We PAN OFF a half-played Scrabble game to find Dylan and

Knox at the windows. Dylan picks up a family photo, Knox

as a little boy with a father in a military uniform.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                 47.

CONTINUED:

Dylan nods.

He brushes his hand against hers.     She brushes back, fingers

against fingers. A long beat.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                   48.

CONTINUED:

He kisses her. After a moment, she breaks off. It's not that

it was a bad kiss. It was a damn good kiss. It's just...

Knox moves towards her.

Dylan holds him back.

She stands up.

She gets up and leaves.

FORMULA-ONE RACE CARS

ROARING past on the track.       It's all thunder, smoke and

asphalt. We are...

EXT. SAN DIEGO SPEEDWAY - DAY

With a ROAR, another blur of racers whips past, with heat

and noise and speed. The lead car bears the familiar

markings of RED STAR INDUSTRIES. Roger Corwin is at the

wheel, steering calmly to a comfortable lead, when he is

suddenly BUMPED.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                  49.

CONTINUED:

ANOTHER BUMP sends him screeching to the left. He almost

crashes, then gets back on course, just as he's passed by...

A SLEEK, BLACK CAR, sponsored by the SONY CORPORATION, and

manned by a mysterious driver with TEXAS TORNADO inscripted on

the helmet. We follow the black car as it pulls into the pit.

EXT. FREEWAY PIT - DAY

The racer pulls off her helmet as the pit crew surrounds her.

Of course, the racer is Natalie, aka BETTY LOU HOBERT, the Texas

Tornado.

Natalie shakes out her hair, winks at the pit boss.

The Pit Crew races in to make repairs. DYLAN, dressed in a

pit suit, kneels by Natalie's front tire. Natalie crouches

down next to her so they can talk.

Dylan steals away, heading for...

CORWIN'S PIT CREW --

Corwin is seething mad as he pulls into his pit.

The pit repairs his car as Corwin is approached by another

racer, also wearing a Red Star racing suit. He leans into

Corwin's car and now we see that's it's... THE THIN MAN.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                   50.

CONTINUED:

The Thin Man peers over at Natalie, but she's got her

back to him.

Corwin peels out onto the track again, almost crushing

the Thin Man in the process.

AS CORWIN PULLS OUT

Dylan sneaks in. In all the cacophony, no one notices

as she grabs CORWIN'S SUITCASE out of the back seat of

his regular car, a bitching Mercedes. She checks both

ways to see if she's being watched.

EXT. THE WINNER'S CIRCLE

Where Alex, dressed as a trophy girl, watches the race

through binoculars and keeps an eye on her pals. She

nods to BOSLEY, who is dressed as the Flag Waver. He

speaks into a walkie talkie.

BACK IN THE PIT --

Dylan pulls a briefcase out of her jumpsuit, and swaps

it with one in Corwin's car. She carefully switches all

his files from the old briefcase to the new one, then

gives Alex a thumbs up.

MEANWHILE BACK IN THE RACE --

NATALIE roars back onto the track, keeping Corwin in her

sights. Then she spots another Red Star car, coming up

right next to her. She locks eyes with the Thin Man.

The two of them recognize each other at the exact same

instant.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                  51.

CONTINUED:

The Thin Man, realizing he's been made, jams on the

brakes and skids off to the right, which leads to a ramp

that heads out of the stadium.

Natalie, not wanting to lose him, does something crazy.

Even though she's at the front of the pack, she brakes

hard, swerves into a full 180 degree U-turn, and starts

heading the WRONG WAY on the race track.

Startled drivers pull off to the left and right as she

follows the Thin Man out of the racetrack.

EXT. SPEEDWAY ACCESS ROAD - DAY

To a chorus of CAR HORNS, the Thin Man's blue racer weaves

through the spectator traffic entering the speedway.

Looking back, we see Natalie is gaining on him.

Finally clear of the traffic, both cars let it rip.

HELICOPTER VIDEO FOOTAGE

Looking down on a freeway, where a ubiquitous police

pursuit is in progress.

A beat-up gray Chrysler leads a phalanx of police cars

down the empty freeway. It's oddly calm and hypnotizing.

Suddenly, the blue Formula One car comes screeching past

the cops and the suspect, over 200 miles per hour.

INT. NATALIE'S RED CAR / ON THE FREEWAY - DAY

Still hot on the Thin Man's tail, Natalie has the engine

ROARING.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                               52.

CONTINUED:

As she passes the police cars, we see several OFFICERS

look over -- what the hell?

Natalie catches up to the gray Chrysler. Looks over to

see the WILD-EYED SUSPECT, hunched over the wheel.

He looks back at her. A beat later, she's passed him,

just taillights on the freeway.

EXT. FREEWAY - DAY

With the lanes cleared for the other chase, there is

nothing preventing the Formula One cars from hitting top

speed -- which they do.

Natalie is catching up to the Thin Man.

As they head under an overpass, we see KIDS CHEERING.

INT. BLUE CAR - DAY

The Thin Man checks his gauges. The gas dial is perilously

close to empty -- these cars are meant to be refilled often.

Up ahead, he sees an exit.   He starts to slow down...

EXT. FREEWAY - DAY

... but when you're going 200 miles per hour, that can

take a while. He misses the exit.

Natalie is trying to match his speed.

The Thin Man pulls over to the side, stops fully.

Braking as hard as she can, Natalie still passes him.

The Thin Man throws a U-turn, heading up the freeway on-ramp.

Natalie follows.

EXT. SAN DIEGO SHIPYARD - DAY

We catch glimpses behind fences and between train cars --

the two racers gliding slowly down the narrow roads, like

lions pacing.

INT. NATALIE'S RED CAR - DAY

Pulling off her helmet, Natalie scans right and left for

the blue car -- she's lost sight of him. The narrow

windshields of these racers doesn't make it any easier.

EXT. SHIPYARD - DAY

We LOOK DOWN on Natalie's car as she rounds a corner,

still searching.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                               53.

EXT. PIER - DAY

Natalie spots the blue racer reaching the end of the

long pier. It pulls a U-turn to face her, then stops,

engine idling. There's only way off the pier, and it's

past Natalie.

The Thin Man REVS his engine.

Natalie REVS hers.

ANGLE ON a white seagull, pecking at something on the

pier, halfway between the two racers. The bird looks up,

hearing the engines.

ANGLE ON the Thin Man. He pulls his harness tighter.

REVS his engine higher.

ANGLE ON Natalie. If it's a game of chicken he wants,

she'll give it to him. She REVS her engine higher still.

The noise scares the bird, who suddenly flies off. Like

a flag being dropped, that's the signal for both racers

to peel out.

A cloud of SMOKE.    Rubber on asphalt.

Already reaching a tremendous speed, the racers are on a

collision course. The Thin Man isn't going to turn away.

Neither is Natalie.

Racing faster, and faster still, there's only one way

this can turn out. But then, at the very last moment,

the Thin Man wusses out. He cuts the wheel right,

missing Natalie and careening off the edge of the pier.

In SLOW MOTION, we watch as his racer hangs in mid-air,

wheels still spinning. Back-heavy, the tail hits the

water first.

Natalie brakes hard, cuts the wheel to avoid going off

the far end of the pier. She finally stops, the rear

tire just 1/4 inch from the edge.

CRANING UP along the side of the pier, we find Natalie

looking into the water where the blue racer went in.

There's just a slick of oil and a steady stream of bubbles.

VIDEO / CAMERA'S P.O.V.

We see lots of hallways, doorways and security locks, all

from the POV of a man's hip.

The footage is from the camera in the switched briefcase

that Corwin is now carrying with him.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                               54.

CONTINUED:

We PULL BACK from the video to see we are actually

watching it...

INT. CHARLES TOWNSEND AGENCY - DAY

... on the big screen. The angels and Bosley watch the

footage, along with Knox and Vivian Wu. Vivian has

seated herself close to Natalie. So close, in fact, that

Natalie keeps having to shift a few inches.

Dylan, meanwhile, sits across the room from Knox,

deliberately avoiding eye contact.

ON THE BIG SCREEN: As the videocamera passes a room

marked with an intimidating warning sign...

VIDEO FREEZES.

All eyes go over to Natalie.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                               55.

CONTINUED:

Knox is impressed.    The other angels nod.   It's a good idea.

Alex checks with her fellow angels.    They're in agreement.

With a subtle RUSH, we move into a stylized MONTAGE that

shows How They Do It. It features WHIP PANS, FREEZE

FRAMES and ZOOMS to show us only the highlights.

WHIP CUT TO:

INT. NUDE NUDE NUDE GIRLS - DAY

ANGLE ON DIRECTOR #1, 40's, part of the lunchtime crowd.

Alex and Natalie are on the catwalk, in the middle of a

grinding routine. Paying for his drink, he fumbles with

his wallet. His waitress helps him find the right bill.

As she walks away, we see the waitress is Dylan. FREEZE FRAME.

We ZOOM IN on the orange key-card she's grabbed from him.

EXT. BACK YARD BIRTHDAY PART - DAY

ANGLE ON Bosley, done up in full clown makeup. He tries

to twist a balloon animal, but no luck. Finally it POPS.

The CHILDREN CRY.

Entertaining the ADULTS, magician Alex whips open her silk

handkerchief to reveal that the "item" has disappeared.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                  56.

CONTINUED:

ANGLE ON DIRECTOR #2, who looks very worried. Magician's

assistant Dylan takes off her giant hat to reveal the director's

billfold is underneath. Getting it back, he's

relieved.

Passing behind Dylan, Natalie takes the orange keycard

Dylan hands off. FREEZE FRAME. ZOOM IN.

EXT. STREET OFF MULHOLLAND - DAY

ANGLE ON Roger Corwin, driving his Mercedes.     He slows,

a road crew working ahead.

ANGLE ON Dylan, dressed in an orange vest, manning the

slow/stop sign. She makes Corwin stop, leans in to

apologize for the delay.

Behind the Mercedes, Natalie sneaks up. She quickly

picks the trunk lock, then quietly climbs in. She hoists

in a large duffel bag, then shuts herself inside.

INT. TRUNK OF CORWIN'S MERCEDES - DAY

We HEAR the car moving again.

Stripped down to a bra, Natalie attaches an illuminated mirror

to the underside of the trunk lid. Starts to pull more items

from her duffel bag: black shoes, a dress shirt, a tie.

EXT. RED STAR - DAY

Establishing. We see Corwin's Mercedes pull into the

parking garage.

INT. PARKING GARAGE / RED STAR - DAY

Walking away from the car, Corwin hits the remote.    The

Mercedes BWOOPS.

A beat later, a hand comes out from under the trunk lid.

Natalie climbs out, only she's not Natalie anymore.

She's become Corwin -- identical to the last detail.

She tucks the last of the latex mask under her collar as

she walks. FREEZE FRAME.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                 57.

INT. SECURITY STATION - DAY

Corwin puts his right hand on the sensor grid.    A laser

scans it. Approved.

The Security Guard hits the button, releasing the gate.

He goes back to his magazine as Corwin passes through.

A beat, then...

Tommy the Guard looks up, sees Corwin is still at the

counter.

He hits the button again, letting Corwin through. Tommy

goes back to his magazine, still a little perplexed.

INT. SECURE HALLWAY - DAY

The same places we saw on the videotape. Natalie-as-

Corwin swipes the two stolen failsafe cards in a reader,

sending the lights from red to green. FREEZE FRAME.

She splices in a transmitter the size of a cigarette pack.

Pulls up a tiny antenna. FREEZE FRAME.

INT. SECURE HALLWAY - DAY

Corwin walks down the hall, still talking with his

colleague. Natalie-as-Corwin is walking right towards

them. She turns away as she passes. He didn't even spot

her.

She smiles.

EXT. POSH BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - DAY

Establishing...

INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

As a group, the angels move through the upscale lunch

crowd to find Knox and Vivian Wu at a booth.

Alex opens a slim Sony laptop, sets it on the table.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                  58.

CONTINUED:

Astonished, Vivian Wu hits some keys, checking that what

they say is true.

Smiling, Knox motions for them to take a seat.

A look between the angels.      They know it's true.

She reaches for the laptop.      Bosley snatches it away.

Reluctantly, Vivian Wu pulls her hand away. Bosley tucks

the laptop into a steel briefcase, then stands.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                  59.

CONTINUED:

Dylan does a spit take, the other two Angels roll their eyes.

As Bosley exits the restaurant, Vivian Wu eyes him

carefully. Knox raises a glass to toast the Angels.

As they get up...

She notices the other Angels staring at her.        She doesn't answer

at first.

Natalie quickly picks up what's going on.        She glances at

Alex, then clears her throat.

THE LADIES ROOM

Natalie, Alex, and Dylan kibbitz near the sinks.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                     60.

CONTINUED:

They turn to look at her.

She walks out of the ladies' room.

INT. PARKING GARAGE / BEVERLY HILLS - DAY

Bosley hums "In the Navy" to himself as he walks through

a parking garage. He's alone in the echo-y garage, and

everything we know about movies tells us This Means Trouble.

BWEEP BWEEP as his alarm shuts off. Just as he's about

to lift the handle, he stops. Looks back over his shoulder.

Did he hear something? He scans the empty garage.         No

one in sight. Must've been his imagination.

INT. BOSLEY'S MERCEDES - DAY

Bosley climbs in, shutting the door behind him.        He's

putting the keys in the ignition, when...

A HAND clamps a chloroformed rag over his mouth. It's

the Thin Man. Bosley struggles, but in moments, he's

unconscious.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                61.

OUTSIDE THE CAR

THE THIN MAN stuffs Bosley in the trunk, slams it shut,

revealing...

Vivian Wu, standing beside the Thin Man. She's holding

the case Bosley refused to give her before.

The Thin Man sighs, whips out his cell phone.

And speaking of weekend plans...

EXT. ITALIAN STREET - NIGHT

Jason and Alex are walking down a beautiful, tree-lined

cobblestone street, holding hands. The buildings and

outdoor cafes are reminiscent of a quaint, vaguely

European town.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                   62.

CONTINUED:

He stops, takes her in his arms. With the moonlight

shining down, it's very romantic. They kiss. Then...

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                  63.

CONTINUED:

BLAM!    BLAM!   Gunshots ring out!

Alex, in Angels mode, immediately throws him to the

ground and covers him. She feels something wet, looks

down to see Jason's chest, covered in blood.

He wipes off a little, puts it on her tongue.     Finally

convinced, she almost lets herself laugh.

REVEAL

that we are in a soundstage, the cobblestones street is

just a set. The gunfire was coming from some effects

guys, who are test firing guns for the upcoming action

scene just outside the soundstage, visible through the

open loading door.

He helps her up.

As he walks out of the soundstage, Alex is left behind,

alone. She cleans herself off, shaking her head at her

own paranoia.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                               64.

CONTINUED:

THIPP!

A wall next to her sprays a cloud of plaster.     Alex looks

at the hole. That's strange.

THIP, THIP!

Two more little explosions, these barely missing her face.

Suddenly, without warning, the wall is plastered with

SILENCED GUNFIRE. It's only Alex's instincts that let

her duck in time to avoid being turned into Swiss cheese.

She tucks and rolls behind a Styrofoam set as...

TWO GUNMEN with silenced SNIPER rifles fan out on the

fake city street.

ON ALEX --

crouched behind a wall.

She looks both ways. If she tries to break for the open

loading door, she'll lead the gunmen right back to Jason.

Only way out of here is to head for the far wall, all the

way across the building, where there's a fire exit.

Taking a deep breath, she darts across the fake street.

THE GUNMEN

fire at her, one of them pulling off his silencer and going

to machine gun mode. The sound of the gunshots are covered

by the sound of the effects guy, test firing guns outside.

ALEX --

Sees that the sets are held up by wooden support beams.

She lifts her leg and delivers a solid blow, cracking the

two-by-fours in half.

THE GUNMEN

move slowly through the fake street set. Suddenly, they

hear a creaking sound. They look up to see the whole,

fake building set collapsing!

They dive out of the way, just in time to see Alex race

through the fire doors.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                65.

EXT. BACKLOT - NIGHT

Alex races out of the soundstage and jumps into her car,

parked nearby. The Gunmen emerge from the stage and spot

her, just as she gets the car started. She peels out as

a hail of gunfire just misses her windshield.

EXT. OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE SOUNDSTAGE

Jason has just gotten his squibs refitted. He's facing

the opposite direction, so he doesn't see Alex's car

whizz away in the background.

INT. SOUNDSTAGE

Jason walks into the Soundstage, followed by the effects crew.

Of course, she's nowhere to be found. While he looks

around, one of the effects guys fingers a bullet hole in

the set wall. He presses against it and a FLATTENED

BULLET FALLS OUT.

He thinks for a moment, then shakes his head.   Couldn't be.

INT. EGYPTIAN THEATRE - NIGHT

A passing FILMGOER reveals Natalie and Pete. Seated near

the aisle, they share a giant tub of popcorn. The movie

hasn't started yet, but there's a slide show of various

anime heroes and villains.

He shrugs it off.

She's right.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                   66.

CONTINUED:

How can she not be flattered by that? She would say

something back, but the moment has gotten so electrified

that each little glance just brings on more goofy-in-

loveness.

The only solution is to leave...

INT. LADIES ROOM - NIGHT

A wee bit smitten, Natalie enters as the last WOMAN leaves.

We hear just the DRIP DRIP DRIP of a faucet and the Muzak

version of Power Station's "Some Like It Hot."

NATALIE

IN A STALL

Natalie shuts the door behind herself, then sets to work

putting down a tissue-paper seat cover.

SWEEPING ACROSS THE FLOOR

We look under stall doors to find a pair of black men's

boots stepping down from inside. Natalie is not alone.

IN HER STALL

Natalie is about to hoist her skirt when she stops.         Her

Spider Sense is tingling.

A DOOR LATCH

CLICKS open. We TILT UP to see a WELL-DRESSED MAN.          He's

at least 6'3".

He stops at Natalie's stall door, drawing his gun.      A

beat, then he KICKS the door open, revealing...

AN EMPTY STALL.

The automatic toilet FLUSHES itself.      The Man takes a

half-step in, confused. Suddenly --

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                67.

CONTINUED:

The door swings back, SMASHING into his right hand.     He

drops the gun, looking up to see

NATALIE,

Who is perched atop the stall walls.     She pushed the door

with her foot.

Grabbing an overhead pipe, she performs an acrobatic

swing, landing both feet on the guy's head. He falls

into the next row of stalls.

Natalie reaches for the gun, but the Man grabs her ankles.

He pulls her back across the tile floor, flipping her over.

That just makes it easier for her to kick him where it counts.

With a scissors lock around his neck, Natalie is pulled

up while the Man falls. She lands a knee on his windpipe.

He tries to pull her off.    She leans in harder.

Suspicious, she digs inside his coat to pull out a leather

billfold. Flips it open to reveal an I.D. that reads...

INT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

The anime classic is playing. Pete keeps looking back

towards the door. He's been ditched again. Just when he's

about to give up hope, Natalie is there.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                     68.

CONTINUED:

With that, she goes. A beat, then she comes back.

Kisses him once, hard. Then goes for real.

EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT

Dylan and Knox walk hand in hand up a quaint, woodsy path

behind Knox's home. We can hear music drifting up from

the hill in front of them.

He helps her up a steep part of the path.       As she comes

over the crest of a hill.

DYLAN'S POV --

The hill behind Knox's house has a magnificent view right

into the Hollywood Bowl. The music is the symphony

playing something very romantic.

They stand there, together, just listening to the music,

Knox watching her reaction closely.

Dylan seems surprised by this question.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                  69.

CONTINUED:

She smiles t him, motioning for them to go back up to

Knox's house.

INT. KNOX'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Dylan and Knox are asleep in his bed, when the doorbell

CHIMES. Dylan bolts upright. She slips out of bed, peers

out the window. Vivian Wu is waiting by the front door.

Knox pulls on a robe, goes downstairs.

STAY ON DYLAN --

as she pulls on her clothes, her CELL PHONE rings.     She

grabs it.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                 70.

CONTINUED:

EXT. FREEWAY - NIGHT

Driving her own highly excellent car, Natalie has it floored.

INTERCUT

But Dylan's already hung up.     Cursing her partner, Natalie

races the car even harder.

INT. KNOX'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Knox is sitting at the coffee table, signing papers. Vivian,

sitting across from him, has her cell phone open. They are

both surprised to see Dylan walk into the room.

From her bag, Vivian pulls a silver 9MM.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                               71.

CONTINUED:

Although Knox is clueless, it's clear the message Vivian

is sending to Dylan. She's in control here.

Vivian sets the gun on the table, in easy reach.

With a knowing glance at Dylan, she goes back to her

phone call.

No alternative, Dylan takes a seat beside Knox.     Both face

Vivian, whose hand is very near the gun.

Dylan looks at Knox as he reads through his papers.    He has no

idea there's anything wrong.

Vivian gestures to the abandoned Scrabble game on the table.

Why not play?

As Knox flips pages in the report, Dylan casually begins

pushing Scrabble letters around, nothing serious. But she's

managed to spell...

ENEMY

She gets Knox's attention, looks to the word, up to Vivian.

Knox follows her intention, but doesn't seem to believe it.

While Vivian continues to talk on the phone, Knox sets his

report down. Pushes around some letters of his own. The

words finally come out as...

I   KNOW

CLOSE ON Dylan.      What does that mean?

Vivian snaps her phone shut.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                 72.

CONTINUED:

Dylan stands up.    What the hell is going on?

Vivian draws the gun on her.    Knox moves over toward

Vivian's side.

A long beat, Dylan trying to wrap her head around this.

Knox taps his nose.    She's got it.

Dylan looks like she's about to leap forward and tear Knox's

throat out. Vivian gestures for Dylan to keep stepping back.

Dylan crosses the sill, out onto the balcony.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                   73.

CONTINUED:

How right he is, because as soon as Vivian squeezes the

trigger...

Dylan drops to the floor, then rolls.

BLAM!

the bullet misses Dylan and slams into the bulletproof window

causing a spider-web crack to spread. Dylan sees her

opportunity and heads right for the window while Vivian

pumps off shots.

As she comes to the window, Dylan jumps up in the air and

does a flying kick, hitting right at the spot where the

bullet impacted.

SMASH!

The bulletproof glass shatters outward, and Dylan flies out

the window, onto the ledge.

EXT. BALCONY - NIGHT

Dylan looks over the edge of the balcony. The drop-off is

incredibly steep -- the house is built on stilts -- and the

fall looks like it would kill her. But she doesn't have

much choice.

KNOX AND VIVIAN

come running out onto the balcony, just in time to see Dylan

jump. They rush to the edge, look down into a forbidding

thicket of trees.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                74.

CONTINUED:

Knox shakes his head.

The two of them head back inside.    As they do...

We hold on the railing, then slowly start to drift down, to

the underside of the balcony. Dylan has attached her belt to

the bottom of the railing, and is hanging in the rafters. As

she pulls herself back up...

EXT. AIRPORT -- NIGHT

A black sedan pulls onto the tarmac. Knox and Vivian Wu emerge,

then hustle into a waiting private plane.

INT. ANGELS DETECTIVE AGENCY

Natalie, Dylan and Alex nurse their wounds and compare notes.

The angels take a beat to let their indignation grow.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                            75.

CONTINUED:

They look at each other...

And on that note...

EXT. BEACHFRONT COMPOUND - FLORIDA COASTLINE - DAY

We PUSH IN over the water to reveal the massive complex -- half-

villa, half-castle. Built into the green hills, it's

flanked by oversized windmills.

EXT. STAIRCASE -       DAY

Armed guards, as if they were necessary, make sure no one

goes up or down a staircase that leans up into the tower,

where their dangerous prisoner is being held.

INT. COMPOUND TOWER - DAY

Bosley's cell, as such, is a round room.

Bosley flits about in a panic. He's hardly touched the gourmet

food on his tray. Except for the pudding. He loves pudding.

JUMP CUT TO:

Still a-twitter, Bosley flips through the 500 channels on

his big-screen TV. He watches a few moments of E!

JUMP CUT TO:

As the Thin Man takes the tray away, Bosley suddenly attacks

him with the silverware. With a single hand to Bosley's

forehead, the Thin Man holds him at arm's length, harmless.

He takes the weapons away.

JUMP CUT TO:

Bosley WHISTLES to a bright red songbird who has landed

on the windowsill. The bird WHISTLES back. Bosley thinks

they're having a conversation.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                  76.

CONTINUED:

Bosley is going a little insane.

JUMP CUT TO:

In his spacious bathroom, Bosley is sitting on the toilet,

rocking as he makes spaceman noises.

We hear a PLOP in the water, and then a BLEEP BLEEP.

Curious, he stands up and looks in the bowl.      He's surprised

by what he sees.

INT. TOWNSEND AGENCY - DAY

Alex is on the phone, frantically dialing numbers.

There's a very faint voice coming from Bosley's desk drawer.

Dylan walks around the desk, yanks it open...

Dylan grabs the radio receiver from the drawer, holds him up.

Bosley's voice gets louder.

The Angels crowd around Dylan and the receiver.     It seems

impossible.

EXT. COMPOUND TOWER - DAY

CLOSE ON a satellite mini-dish mounted to the roof. We CRANE

DOWN to look in a tower window, where Bosley is hunched over

the TV.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                77.

INT. COMPOUND TOWER - DAY

On the top of the TV, a wire runs from the satellite feed to --

THE TINY RADIO

that Bosley swallowed at the spa.   It's worked its way

through his system.

EXT. RUINS OF TOWNSEND AGENCY - DAY

The angels still can't believe they're hearing his voice.

INT. COMPOUND TOWER - DAY

INTERCUT

This isn't helping.

Dylan finds a globe amid the wreckage.     Wipes off the soot.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                  78.

CONTINUED:

With her fingers, Dylan figures out how far he could have

flown. Estimates the circumference.

The bird Bosley was whistling to lands on the TV, looks

at the transmitter, curious. SINGS its song.

Natalie holds up a finger -- stop.

The bird SINGS its song again.      Natalie smiles.

The MUSIC revs up, as we...

EXT. VILLA COURTYARD

A HELICOPTER touches down inside the villa gates.     Knox

and Vivian emerge.

INT. COMPOUND - DAY

Knox and Vivian walk into a fully macked computer room,

where the Thin Man is supervising a techie as he taps away

at Bosley's laptop.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                  79.

CONTINUED:

The Thin Man pulls a piece of paper out of a printer,

hands them to Knox.

Knox smiles.    Takes the print-out.

The Thin Man hands Knox another print-out.

The Thin Man nods.

INT. KNOX COMPOUND - DAY

The Thin Man cocks his gun as he heads to the tower to do

away with Bosley. Then...

The Henchman leads Thin Man into...

SECURITY ROOM

A room lined with monitors that survey the courtyard. Henchman

points to one in the corner.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                  80.

CONTINUED:

Another camera angle comes up, this also a view of the

empty courtyard.

The Henchman does what he's told and, on the monitor...

WE SEE DYLAN, dressed in a black cat suit, as she rewires

a security camera. She glances around, making sure no

one sees her.

EXT. COURTYARD - DAY

Dylan sneaks her way through the courtyard, doing an

admirable job of trying to stick to the walls. As she

comes around the corner.

She whips around to see the Thin Man, standing right

behind her. She instantly swings at him, he blocks it.

She's about to swing again when five guns get cocked

against her temple. She's surrounded by guards.

NOW --

The thin man and his boys lead Dylan into the house.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                 81.

CONTINUED:

Dylan glares at him, and as she does...

We move in CLOSE ON Dylan's funky belt buckle.       There's a

tiny camera concealed there.

EXT. OUTSIDE THE COMPOUND - DAY

Natalie and Alex huddle around a three-inch monitor,

getting live video from Dylan's camera.

They move into action.

EXT. SECOND STORY VERANDAH - DAY

Dylan is led inside by the Thin Man.       Knox is waiting for her.

She shrugs off the goons -- enough already.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                 82.

CONTINUED:

He flips shut a suitcase filled with C-5 explosive, the

same stuff we saw Pascal selling in the opening scene.

With that, he walks out of the room.

The Thin Man signals to the Henchmen. Two of them force

Dylan to sit in one of the wooden deck chairs.

Then, with the thick packing tape, they begin binding her

arms to the arms of the chair. As they do:

The Thin Man can't help but be amused. After all, there

are six guards and one blonde -- who is now taped to a

chair.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                               83.

CONTINUED:

The Thin Man smirks oh-so-confidently.

Suddenly the door flies open and --

With a glare to Dylan, the Thin Man follows him out.

INT. UNDERWATER GROTTO

Alex, dressed in a sexy bikini, emerges from the water

and instantly takes out two guards.

EXT. SMALL GARDEN - DAY

NATALIE hang-glides into a courtyard, knocking out two

henchmen as she does. Alex catches up with her, as

Natalie pulls out a small scanner.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                               84.

CONTINUED:

Natalie heads left.     Alex goes right.

INT. TOWER OFFICE - DAY

Racing up the stairs, Natalie enters a round room with

open windows on all sides. A gentle breeze stirs the

curtains. There's an amazing 360 degree view, from hills

to ocean.

According to her scanner, Bosley should be here, but

there's no one.

INT. BOSLEY'S ROUND ROOM      DAY

Hearing her voice, the feral Bosley looks up.

INT. TOWER OFFICE - DAY

She hears him. She keeps yelling -- so does he -- until

they both realize that his room is above hers.

She begins frantically checking the desk, the shelves,

everything.

Her cell phone RINGS.     She answers it.

INT. BILTMORE HOTEL - DAY

On break, Pete is talking on a pay phone.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                85.

INT. TOWER OFFICE - DAY

Natalie keeps checking the shelves, looking for a secret

switch.

INTERCUT

Two GOONS race up the stairs into the office.   Natalie

turns to face them.

The Goons approach.

Hitting MUTE, Natalie kicks the chair behind her and dives

under the desk. She comes up on the other side with a

SURGE SUPPRESSOR,

electric cords attached. She backhands it into the

goons, who jerk and twitch as electricity shoots through

their bodies.

She re-mutes.

With a roundhouse kick, she flattens one of the goons,

WHACKS the other with the cell phone.

The first goon charges at her, but she sidesteps at the

last moment, leaving Goon One to hit Goon Two. Both men

topple through the open window, falling. Yikes.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                              86.

CONTINUED:

She starts searching again for the switch.

BEHIND NATALIE, Vivian Wu reaches the top of the stairs.

She moves stealthily. Natalie has no idea she's there.

At the last moment, Natalie catches a moving reflection

in a shiny trophy. Turns to find Vivian Wu swinging an

antique chair at her head.

She ducks.    The chair SHATTERS the display case.

Scrambling to get away, Natalie drops the phone.

Vivian upends the desk, nearly crushing Natalie. Vivian

jumps on top, ready to kick the shit out of our angel.

As we probably suspected, Vivian Wu is one hell of a

martial artist. Fortunately, so is Natalie.

In their first series of blows, Vivian seems to have the

upper hand, but Natalie rallies hard. Vivian surprises

her with a floor-sweeping kick, knocking her down.

Vivian grabs the phone off the floor.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                87.

CONTINUED:

Vivian looks at the phone. Who the fuck cares?      She

throws the phone out the open window.

Getting up, Natalie stares her down, incredulity building

to rage.

Mocking, Vivian wipes away a tear.

Natalie lets forth a typhoon of fury, a full-out Mortal

Kombat. Vivian is thrown back against the bookcase,

where she knocks over a candlestick.

That's the trigger for the bookcases to begin sinking

into the floor. Circling around the room, each set of

shelves drops to a different level, forming steps that

lead to the upstairs room.

As Natalie and Vivian continue to fight, Bosley sticks

his head down from above, watching the brawl. Natalie is

kicking ass.

She slams Vivian into the wall.      Grabs her again, hands

around her head.

Vivian suddenly leans forward and KISSES her, right on

the lips.

Natalie is surprised for a moment, which gives Vivian the

chance to swing at her. She misses.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                              88.

CONTINUED:

She head-butts Vivian, knocking her out cold.   She throws

the limp body on the floor.

A beat, then Natalie looks up to see Bosley.

He waves.

EXT. VERANDAH - DAY

From below, we hear SECURITY WHISTLES. The compound has been

breached. Dylan looks at the six armed guards surrounding her.

And now she does exactly what she told the Thin Man she'd do:

She pitches forward, ducking her head so the chair's back

crashes into the railing, tearing it off. She stands.

The Guards FIRE -- but Dylan has already launched herself

from the railing into that backflip, which lands her on

the head of --

Fat Boy, flattening him bad, and smashing the rest of the

chair into kindling. She grabs the wooden seat and whips

it up, catching bullets from Guard #3 before flinging it

like a Frisbee at Guard #2, nailing him right on the chin.

Quickly she stands again, between Guards #3 and 4.

The two men scoff, disbelieving. Then Dylan does a head

fake, both Guards panic, and fire, but Dylan drops, leaving

each man a clear shot at the other. Both gape. Both fall.

Just Guards #5 and 6 left.    Dylan's chair arms are still

taped to her forearms.

In a whirl, she overhead-chops Guard #5. Drives her

right arm into his shoulder while swinging her left arm

into the back of the Guard #6's head.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                   89.

CONTINUED:

A few more blows, then both men fall.

Now Dylan drops into a second chair, half-exhausted,

half-amused with herself. Has one brief beat to take it

all in, then --

Bosley steps onto the veranda, sees Dylan sitting in the

chair.

FROM HIS POINT OF VIEW: It looks like Dylan -- whose

arms are still strapped to the arms of the first chair --

is taped to the chair she now sits in.

Bosley hurries over, "freeing her." Amused, Dylan lets

him. Natalie steps out from inside, pausing to KICK one

guard who was starting to revive.

EXT. KNOX COMPOUND - DAY

Knox, carrying the briefcase bomb, gets into his waiting

helicopter, followed closely by the Thin Man.

The helicopter quick ascends, just as...

THE THREE ANGELS

run into the courtyard.

The three angels turn to see Bosley, huffing and puffing

his way into the courtyard.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                 90.

CONTINUED:

Bosley lowers his head.    Suddenly all the angels understand.

They race out the courtyard, in hot pursuit.

INT. MIAMI - DAY

Racing across the water, we find thong-clad BEACH BABES

moving to a Latin beat. Art Deco buildings flank sun-kissed

streets. The people are sexy, the daiquiris strong, and every

night's a fiesta -- Welcome to MIAMI.

Running down the street, towards Miami Arena, the three

angels pass THREE OTHER WOMEN rollerblading by: JILL

MONROE, SABRINA DUNCAN and KELLY GARRETT.

Nothing is said, but a cool moment just happened.

INT. LONG, LONG, HALLWAY -- LATER

The three Angels are running down a very long hallway.

Their voices are the only sound that echoes off these

walls, although there is a faint humming that grows louder

as they approach two, metal fire doors.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                   91.

CONTINUED:

They slam into the doors, and we...

INT. MIAMI ARENA - NIGHT

We reverse angle to reveal the inside of Miami Arena. The first

thing that hits us is the WALL OF SOUND, the noise made

by twenty thousand people in a basketball induced frenzy.

The next thing that hits us is the sheer magnitude of the

job facing the Angels. Hard to spot? The crowd is one,

enormous, teeming mass of brightly colored humanity.

The game is in progress, Duke vs. North Carolina, and it's a

barn burner. A one point game with six minutes to go. BALL

PLAYER pulls up and swishes a three pointer, Duke by two.

The crowd goes apeshit.

BY THE MEZZANINE

The Angels huddle, yelling over the deafening noise of the

crowd...

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                               92.

CONTINUED:

They split up. Dylan leads the charge down the loge section,

blowing past the SECURITY WOMAN, who yells after her.

INT. ARENA FLOOR - NIGHT

BEHIND THE RIM, COLLEGE PLAYER #2 pulls down a brick, slams

home the rebound. The crowd ROARS.

INT. LUXURY BOXES --

JASON GIBBONS, famous movie star and North Carolina alumnus,

pumps his fists in the air. His luxury box is loaded with

fellow Tar Heels and nameless studio executives. He

repeatedly high fives a Hollywood type in sunglasses and Armani.

When suddenly, the door to the luxury box is flung open.

Jason whips around and locks eyes with Alex.

Realizing she has no time to explain, and that Charlie isn't

in here, she turns and leaves.

While everyone watches, confused, Jason pushes his way

through the box and follows Alex into the hall.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                               93.

INT. ARENA -- MEZZANINE

Dylan races past rows of seats, pissing off plenty of fans

in the process.

FLASHES FIRE

in the stands.

STATISTICIANS

scribble at their monitors. Natalie runs behind them,

scanning the crowd. WHIP PANS, from ONE MAN to ANOTHER to

ANOTHER. Stopping on a likely candidate...

THE SCOREBOARD CLOCK

counts down.    :60.   :59.    :58.

INT. LUXURY BOXES - NIGHT

Alex bursts in.   It's a crowd of fifteen cocktail-drinking

BUSINESS MEN.

She ducks back into the hallway.

INT. HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS

Alex walks out into the hallway, frustrated.     Then,

miraculously, she spots him...

KNOX.

He walks out of one of the luxury boxes, holding a large,

metal briefcase. He heads for the elevator.

ALEX

immediately goes to intercept him, but...

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                 94.

CONTINUED:

It's the Thin Man, standing behind her, with a gun in

her back.

Knox glances back at the Thin Man, nods to him.      Then he

gets in the elevator.

The Thin Man starts edging Alex towards some emergency exit

doors, gun still in her back. Alex is trying to think of an

escape, quickly. She knows that the second he gets her out

of this public space, he's gonna shoot her. The door gets

closer and closer...

The Thin Man and Alex turn around to face Jason, who is

sweaty and exasperated from chasing her.

The Thin Man digs the gun deeper into her back.

Jason double takes.     He's not used to someone talking to

him like that.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                               95.

CONTINUED:

And then, with no warning, he hauls off and punches the

Thin Man.

Now, Jason's just an actor, not an ass-kicking super

detective, so his punch isn't all that great. In fact, it

leaves Jason shaking his hand in pain.

The Thin Man, a trickle of blood running from his lip, smiles.

First, he pops Jason right in the jaw. Jason stumbles

backward, dazed. Then he reaches for his gun, in the

process, loosening his grip on Alex...

Alex spins out of the Thin Man's grasp and does a full

roundhouse kick, knocking the gun out of the Thin Man's

hands. The Thin Man immediately responds, throwing two

quick punches, which Alex expertly blocks and then follows

with a hitch-kick to the chin.

Jason, dazed and confused, thinks he must be hallucinating.

What's going on is a world class ass-kicking, courtesy of his

girlfriend. While the action star watches in amazement, Alex

unloads an arsenal of bad ass kung fu moves that would make

Jet Li green with envy.

The Thin Man doesn't stand a chance. A flying side kick

sends him stumbling backwards into the stairwell. We

follow the fight...

INT. STAIRWELL -- CONTINUOUS

... to the first landing. The Thin Man, battered and bruised,

reaches down to his ankle holster to get his spare gun, but

Alex is too fast for him. She stamps on his hand, then

drops a knee to his throat.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                96.

CONTINUED:

The Thin Man shakes his head "no."

She presses harder.

INT. HALLWAY

Jason slams out into the stairwell, looking for Alex. He

finds her on her walkie talkie, the Thin Man handcuffed

to the staircase.

Jason nods, sure.

We go to another triptych, all three Angels on their cell

phones in different parts of arena.

Alex turns back to Jason. He's clearly having a difficult

time processing everything he's just seen.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                 97.

CONTINUED:

Alex smiles.    Runs off.

INT. ARENA

Natalie stares up at the clock... :30.       :29.

The WHISTLE BLOWS.

Whew, that was close. But it'll start up any second.       She

has to keep it stopped. But how? She glances to the

sidelines and gets an idea.

ON THE COURT --

MUSIC starts from overhead, the respective teams' cheerleaders

coming out for one last routine.

As they kick into gear, Natalie comes out with them, dressed

as a Duke cheerleader. She follows along with the dancers, a

bit timid at first, then more confident as she gets into it.

INT. ARENA BASEMENT -- BENEATH THE COURT

Dylan races through the basement, looking for the briefcase.

Then she spots it, hooked into some wires that snake up

into ceiling above.

Dylan approaches it cautiously.       She slowly opens the top...

REVEAL THE BOMB --

there are about fifty different wires, in every color in

the Crayola box.

INT. COURTSIDE

Alex, still searching for Charlie, notices something strange.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                98.

NATALIE

is fully transformed on the court, from wallflower to full-

out cheerleader. It's not that she's as good as the other

cheerleaders. She's better.

ON THE COURT

The SONG ends. The Cheerleaders vacate the court, but Natalie

keeps dancing her heart out. She has 18,000 fans watching

her, and she's totally in the moment. But there's another

agenda as well...

INT. MIAMI ARENA -- CONTINUOUS

Dylan has picked two wires.

She prepares to snip them with her wire cutters, when...

She spins to see Knox, standing behind her.

He holds up a small TRIGGERING DEVICE. It's the same one

we saw Pascal try to sell in the opening scene.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                             99.

CONTINUED:

Realizing she has no choice, Dylan stands up and backs away.

Knox laughs.

Knox turns to go, but the other Angels are blocking his way.

Stumbling backwards, Knox holds it up high.

Everyone turns, as one, to a figure emerging from the shadows.

That's right, it's Charlie. Finally, after all these years,

we get a look at him, and boy is it... disappointing.

He's not what we expected. Short, portly, dressed in a

"We're #1" t-shirt; the Angels are absolutely floored by

Charlie's appearance.

Charlie ignores their stares and addresses Knox directly.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                 100.

CONTINUED:

Charlie spreads his arms, leaving Knox a plenty wide target.

It's a horribly tense moment.       The Angels are frozen, watching

Knox decide Charlie's fate.

Knox is sweating, debating his choices. Can he really do

this? Charlie's not the glamorous, smug asshole he imagined.

He starts lowering his gun.

BLAM!

It all happens in the blink of an eye. Knox fires, hitting

Charlie in the chest. Natalie leaps out and tackles Knox.

Alex dives and grabs the detonator, before it has a chance

to go off.

Dylan runs to Charlie's side.

She hold shim in her arms as the other Angels gather round

their fallen leader. He gasps for air.

Then Dylan notices something weird. He's not gasping for

air, there's something stuck in his mouth.

With a great, hacking cough, he spits it out. It's a voice

chip, like the one Dylan used in the opening scene.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                101.

CONTINUED:

The voice isn't Charlie's. Dylan reaches down and rips

off Charlie's mask, revealing...

He pulls back the padding from the suit, revealing a small

wound where the bullet grazed his side.

Dylan laughs, Alex ruffles his hair.

The Angels all look at each other.      No one knows.

EXT. CENTER PASSAGE - DAY

In gorgeous SLOW MOTION, the three angels walk side-by-side

with a calm assurance, fireballs exploding behind them.

They won.

As MUSIC rises, the ANGELS TRIPTYCH descends, then peels

away to reveal...

EXT. GORGEOUS BEACH - DAY

The angels kick back on the white sands, tropical drinks in-

hand. Bosley is there as well, with a grass hat and zinc

on his sniffer.

Charlie is on the cellular speakerphone.

The Angels, and Bosley, clink glasses.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                102.

CONTINUED:

They toast the speakerphone.

NATALIE AND ALEX TURN TO SEE

PETER AND JASON

walking across the beach towards them. Each is carrying a

drink of his own. They wave. Damn those men look good.

Alex and Natalie share a smile.

A SUNNY DECK

We're in Charlie's point-of-view. We can see part of his

reflection in the window -- not enough to see his face,

but we get some sense of the man.

He turns away, begins walking.    Steps down onto the sand.

With that, he hangs up. We stay in his P.O.V., walking

across the beach. And it's not just any beach.

TO THE LEFT, WE NOTICE

PETE AND JASON

approaching.    We're on the same beach.

Looking right, we see the backs of the Angels and Bosley.

They have no idea that Charlie is walking right behind them.

A beat, then Dylan looks back.

She looks directly as us -- at Charlie -- tracking as we

move past. Does she somehow recognize it's Charlie?

From her reaction, it's not clear.

A beat, then we...

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                            103.

REVERSE ANGLE/NOT P.O.V.

Dylan looks back forward again. Did she just see Charlie?

Her smile tells us she thinks she did.

She raises a toast.

They knock glasses.

Right at the moment we should probably fade out, Bosley

spills his icy drink in his lap. His eyes go wide.

The Angels just have to laugh.

We FREEZE FRAME, then...

CUT TO BLACK.
