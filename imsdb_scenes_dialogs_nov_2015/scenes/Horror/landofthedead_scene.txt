Mike stands, turns, and...

...is GRABBED from behind by a ZOMBIE! It's not one of the

three they've been watching. This one wears the remains of a

CLOWN SUIT. Half its bulbous red nose has been eaten away.

Painted eyelashes make its stare alarming. Its ORANGE HAIR is

crawling with SPIDERS. It wrestles Mike to the ground. Opens

its lipsticked mouth. Is about to bite Mike's neck when...

...Riley FIRES his .45. BLAM! A bullet SHATTERS the Clown's

SHOULDER CAP. The dead thing is pitched backward, but seems

to feel no pain. It hunkers over Mike again.

Clown's CHEST, NECK, CHEEK. Finally, the FOURTH PUNCHES A

HOLE above the thing's left eyebrow. The Clown DROPS.

INT. DEAD RECKONING - NIGHT

RILEY and MIKE step into a tight, uncomfortable space.

Generators whir. Gears turn. The two men open a storage

locker and strap on ammo belts as...

...SOMETHING TERRIBLE LOOMS out of the shadows! It moves

toward Riley and Mike, who can't see it from behind the

locker. The LEFT SIDE OF THE THING'S FACE has been BURNED

AWAY. Only scar-tissue remains, and a single usable eye

bulging from a socket.

Riley turns. Sees the thing. And, surprisingly, he relaxes,

recognizing CHARLIE HOUK, a heavily-armed guerilla whose

intellect is as burned as his face.

EXT. DEAD RECKONING - NIGHT

...RILEY, CHARLIE, and MIKE step out of A VEHICLE the size

of a city bus. The words DEAD RECKONING are painted on its

side. This is no bus. It's a war wagon, built of SCAVENGED

PARTS with a RIVETED STEEL SKIN. GATTLING GUNS protrude from

a MEAN-LOOKING SNOUT. A ROOF TURRET supports two FOURTEEN

INCH-CANNONS. Rotating lights SHINE in all directions,

piercing the night.

THOOMB! THOOMB! THOOMB! That sound again. MORTAR TUBES on the

vehicle's roof are launching FIREWORKS that BURST in the sky.

THE WHITE MOVING VAN rolls in and parks beside Dead Reckoning.

CHOLO jumps out with the THREE GUERILLAS from the dump.

FOUR GUERILLAS get into an old T-BIRD CONVERTIBLE mounted with

machine guns. TWO OTHER ARMED MEN climb onto MOTORCYCLES. The

very night seems to GROWL as everyone starts their engines.

R

Charlie is wearing four holstered sidearms, two shouldered

automatic rifles, a REMINGTON...and a sly smile that makes us

wonder whether he's an idiot or not.

VROOOM! The T-Bird and the motorcycles pull out toward town.

engine, and heads out.

Riley and Charlie start to get back into Dead Reckoning. Mike

follows, pausing to look up at the "sky flowers".

EXT. MAIN STREET - UNIONTOWN - NIGHT

DEAD THINGS stand completely frozen in the middle of main

street, like statues, mesmerized by the FIREWORKS.

Only one figure is moving. BIG DADDY. He weaves between his

brothers and sisters, urgently waving his one good hand,

like Frankenstein's monster, as if to say "Bad! Bad!" He has

learned that fireworks bring danger.

R

A DEAD TEENAGE CHEERLEADER, holding filthy pom-poms, looks at

Big Daddy, unable to grasp what he's trying to communicate.

A SPEAR is DRIVEN through the Cheerleader's face! The spear

is held like a lance by HARRY, a guerilla who roars past on

his motorcycle hooting like a cowhand on round-up. Other

BIKERS rumble down the street, firing guns.

Big Daddy watches the Cheerleader fall. It throws its head

back and lets out a great HOWL.

INT. DEAD RECKONING - NIGHT

THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD: RILEY recognizes BIG DADDY from the

gas station. He also recognizes the Thing's anguish as...

EXT. TOP OF MAIN STREET - UNIONTOWN - NIGHT

...DEAD RECKONING, mortars still shooting FIREWORKS, stops on

the edge of town. CHOLO pulls up alongside on his bike.

INT. DEAD RECKONING - NIGHT

THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD: RILEY and MIKE watch the T-BIRD ROAR

down MAIN STREET. The FOUR GUERILLAS inside laugh gleefully

as they use the MACHINE GUNS to MOW DOWN HAPLESS ZOMBIES.

Mike climbs out and gets on the back of Cholo's motorcycle.

R

EXT. UNIONTOWN FOODMART - NIGHT

THE WHITE MOVING VAN pulls up to a supermarket. THE DEAD

THINGS in the parking lot, gazing at the FIREWORKS, barely

notice the vehicle. MARKSMEN keep the lot covered as

GUERILLAS carry CASES OF CANNED GOODS out of the supermarket

and into the van. The team has this down to a science.

EXT. UNIONTOWN SIDE STREET - NIGHT

DEAD RECKONING RUMBLES down a side street, its steel skin

reflecting the FLASH of fireworks.

PRETTY BOY drives. RILEY stands beside her.

Harry's riderless motorcycle fishtails up the street and hits

the side of a building.

motorcycle, driven by ANCHOR, who looks like Popeye, RUMBLES

up in the nick of time.

Fighting off the Dead Things, Harry gets on and speeds away.

INT. DEAD RECKONING - NIGHT

PRETTY BOY turns a corner. Out the windshield, RILEY sees...

EXT. MAIN STREET - UNIONTOWN - NIGHT

...CHOLO and MIKE, on Cholo's bike, joining up with FOXY, a

red-haired guerilla on his own motorcycle. The three drive

toward the end of town.

EXT. UNIONTOWN STATE STORE - NIGHT

CHOLO SCREECHES to a stop at a LIQUOR STORE with MIKE and

FOXY. All dismount and start toward the entrance. They stop

as DEAD RECKONING pulls up and RILEY and CHARLIE climb out.

Cholo and Foxy start into the liquor store. The doors are

wide open. All that can be seen from outside is darkness.

But Mike has followed the others inside.

INT. UNIONTOWN STATE STORE - NIGHT

CHOLO unstraps his crossbow and leads the way cautiously

into the dark space. Every subtle SOUND in the SILENCE puts

MIKE more on edge. His hand tenses on his gun as SHADOWS loom

in front of him. Shadows that could be zombies, but are not.

Behind the dusty glass doors of a once-refrigerated wall-

unit, Cholo sees a CASE OF DOM PERIGNON. He goes to the

refrigerator. Re-strapping his crossbow, he opens the door.

Reaches in for the case of champagne. His two hands grab it.

A THIRD HAND GRABS IT!

Cholo looks up. The refrigerator has no back wall. A DEAD

THING with a Manson-like SWASTIKA tattooed in the center of

its forehead has stepped in from the shadows of a loading

area beyond. It GRABS Cholo with a terrifying GROWL.

Cholo falls under the weight of the champagne, and the

weight of the Dead Thing, which drops on top of him. They

roll, struggling. The Thing holds Cholo in a death grip.

At the front of the store, Mike fumbles with his rifle.

Foxy shoots at the Dead Thing and misses.

Cholo PUNCHES the Thing with his free hand. The Dead Thing's

head recoils, but lowers again toward Cholo, the Swastika

looming, drooling teeth baring for a bite. Cholo's eyes

flash. It's the first time we've seen him scared.

BLAM! CHARLIE FIRES one round, right into the center of the

swastika on the Zombie's forehead. The Thing crumples.

B

EXT. MAIN STREET - UNIONTOWN - NIGHT

THE WHITE MOVING VAN, THE T-BIRD, AND THE JEEP roll out of

town in a convoy. Trailing them, THREE SADISTIC GUERILLAS on

MOTORCYCLES ROAR past, firing...

...a HAIL OF BULLETS at A DEAD FAMILY on the sidewalk. The

MOTHER FALLS. Not shot. It has been GRABBED and SHOVED down

to the ground by...

...BIG DADDY! Who GRABS the little GIRL next, thrusting her

roughly behind the protection of a wrecked car. The FATHER is

last. Big Daddy grabs it from behind, by its hair, just as...

...ROUNDS from an UZI DRILL A DOTTED-LINE across the Father's

neck. Big Daddy is unhurt, but spattered with BLOOD. Not red,

greenish-black. The blood of the dead.

T

The HEAD remains suspended in Big Daddy's hand. His face

contorts. His mouth opens and closes, trying to utter sounds.

with sympathy. After a moment, the sympathy is joined by

rage. Big Daddy lifts his right foot and brings it STOMPING

DOWN on the disembodied head, CRUSHING ITS SKULL.

The convoy ROARS off, leaving a cloud of exhaust. Big Daddy

sees Harry's downed motorcycle lying in the street. The butt

of an AUTOMATIC RIFLE protrudes from a saddlebag.

Big Daddy goes over. Pulls out the rifle. Tests the weight of

it in his hand. Curls his finger in through the guard and

pulls the trigger.

BLAM! A bullet ricochets off a brick wall. Big Daddy is

startled at first. Then, he relaxes, realizing the rifle's

power. With surprising dexterity, he slings the weapon's

strap over his head and across his chest, patting the strap

as if comforted by it. Turning, he looks toward...

...THE DISTANT GLOW OF A SKYSCRAPER that can be seen ON THE

HORIZON. That's the direction the convoy is headed. That's

where the bad men came from. That's where he wants to go.

REVERSE ANGLE:

With the city in the distance, Big Daddy starts walking.

NUMBER NINE falls into step beside him. Soon there are MORE.

None of them knows where they are going. Or why. All that

seems to matter is that they have a leader.

EXT. DEPOT - PRE-DAWN

DEAD RECKONING, emitting tendrils of HOT STEAM from twenty

steel nostrils, stands parked in a corner of a fenced-in

outdoor yard. (We don't see how big the yard is. Yet.) A

SEARCHLIGHT sweeps the darkness as GUERILLAS unload the

supplies they took from Uniontown and carry them toward...

...a set of RUSTY STEEL DOORS, above which is a FADED SIGN

that reads "SUBWAY (TO CITY)".

In the bustle of activity, HARRY, the biker who was attacked

in town, perspires as he helps unload. He looks ill.

RILEY walks past, handing out bottles of beer to the men.

Harry doesn't answer.

Harry SPINS! GROWLS! LUNGES at Riley like a beast!

Riley has no time to reach for his gun. The Harry-Thing is

strangling him. SMASHING the neck of a beer bottle on the

snout of Dead Reckoning, Riley JAMS THE JAGGED GLASS into

the Harry-Thing's forehead. Its body drops to the ground.

Riley looks down at the body with a mixture anger and regret.

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - DAWN

A mile-long subway tunnel extends into BLACKNESS. A wide

PLATFORM runs the length of the tracks, at the head of which

A DERELICT TRAIN is parked.

A CARGO CARRIER pulls out, driving along the platform, its

flatbed piled with supplies, while ANOTHER CARRIER is being

loaded with boxes of food, pharmaceuticals, ammunition, and...

TWO BODY BAGS.

T

The cargo carrier that was first to pull out drives into the

tunnel. CEILING LIGHTS spaced far apart STUTTER on and off.

Two guerillas, ANCHOR and MOUSE, who looks like a mouse, ride

on the open flatbed with the cargo.

The tunnel is filled with looming steel shapes that cast

menacing shadows. Mouse shifts nervously. Suddenly...

...PLINK! SOMETHING WET FALLS ON HIS FACE! He JUMPS.

Recovers. Wipes his cheek with his sleeve.

He takes out a joint. Lights up. The match FLARES. SPLAT!

Mouse and the match are soaked by WATER dripping from above.

EXT. THE CITY - DAY

RIVERS flank a TRIANGLE OF LAND where A CITY glows in the

sunrise. Once proud and prosperous, its buildings now seem

like tombstones. SEVEN BARRICADED BRIDGES span the rivers.

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - DAWN

A TV MONITOR broadcasts views of A KITCHEN, A PLUSH LIVING

ROOM, A DEN with a VIDEO FIREPLACE.

Holding his case of Dom Perignon and his box of Cohibas,

CHOLO looks with FOXY at a monitor mounted to a white-tiled

subway station wall. Down the tunnel behind them, the other

GUERILLAS unload supplies from CARGO CARRIERS parked on the

platform. A sign reads, "GOLDEN TRIANGLE/FIDDLER'S GREEN".

B

Cholo looks up at the TV monitor. Riley follows his gaze,

seeing well-dressed PEOPLE sipping cocktails in a club room.

The image on the TV MONITOR changes to an overhead view of

the city and its rivers. Animation draws a RED LINE along the

base of the "golden triangle", a zone known as "THE THROAT".

EXT. THE CITY - "THE THROAT" - DAWN

In live action, not on the   monitor, WEARY TROOPS, sloppily

uniformed, guard four rows   of electrified, barbed-wire FENCING.

DEAD THINGS cluster by the   DOZENS outside the barricades.

CORPSES hang all along the   stretch, suspended on the barbs.

A WALKER lumbers in and touches the fencing. SPARKS FLY! The

Thing's flesh is literally COOKED! BOILS develop, POPPING

OPEN, emitting SMOKE. Still the Thing remains animated.

decimated. Its body hangs, welded to the SPARKING barbs.

INT. FIDDLER'S GREEN CENTRAL MALL - MORNING

CHOLO approaches a CHECKPOINT manned by TWO SECURITY GUARDS.

Setting down the champagne and Cohibas, he unstraps his

weapons and hands them over.

R

The Guard takes Cholo's weapons and returns a claim check.

CHOLO collects his boxes and steps onto an escalator that

carries him up into an ENORMOUS ATRIUM. The "mall" we saw on

TV. SUNLIGHT splashes through glass walls onto box-planted

trees. Caged birds CHIRP seemingly in tune with the Chopin

that lilts over a sound system. SHOPPERS, expensively over-

dressed, stroll past stores. OTHER RESIDENTS lunch at

"outdoor" cafes. Cholo pulls out a kerchief and wipes the

smudges off his face, trying to make himself presentable.

EXT. "GOLDEN TRIANGLE" - MORNING

FIDDLER'S GREEN, a heavily protected HIGH-RISE in the center

of the city, dominates the skyline. It's where the Fat Cats

live, protected from urban decay. The building is surrounded

by unoccupied high-rises that define "the golden triangle", a

clean section in the center of the city. No ugliness in view.

RILEY and CHARLIE cross a manicured plaza to a CHECKPOINT

manned by TWO SECURITY GUARDS. Riley hands over his ID.

EXT. "GHETTO" - MORNING

RILEY and CHARLIE walk down a street into the city's "ghetto"

zone, which is lined with taverns, gambling clubs, strip

joints, like a boom town from Alaskan gold-rush days. BUYERS

and SELLERS lurk in the shadows, copulating, dealing drugs.

them in return with a smile and a nod, handing some bills to

a FATHER with a YOUNG SON, patting an OLD MAN on the back.

EXT. GARAGE - MORNING

Turning a corner, RILEY and CHARLIE stop in front of a

rundown GARAGE with a tarp hanging down instead of a door.

Riley pulls it aside and looks in. A HOBO lies asleep on a

grease-stained floor, curled under some old newspapers.

Riley stands there, grim-faced.

INT. PENTHOUSE CORRIDOR - FIDDLER'S GREEN - DAY

and Cohibas, steps out, walks to "PENTHOUSE NUMBER ONE", and

rings the bell. An instant after he pushes the button...

...the door is JERKED OPEN by TYLER KNIPP, 50-something, an

African American man in a white butler's jacket. Frightened,

he's wielding a SCISSORS, poised to strike.

A SCREAM RINGS OUT down the corridor!

ANOTHER SCREAM.

Cholo drops his boxes and moves down the corridor.

Cholo reaches the door to PENTHOUSE NUMBER TWO. It's locked.

ANOTHER SCREAM from inside. He FLINGS himself at the door.

The LATCH SPLINTERS out of the frame. The door BURSTS open...

INT. PENTHOUSE NUMBER-TWO - FIDDLER'S GREEN - DAY

...and CHOLO enters a dark foyer. The only light comes from

another room somewhere inside. A soft, rhythmic SQUEAK, like

a child's swing moving back and forth, ECHOES through the

apartment. It's an eerie, incongruous sound.

On guard, eyes straining, Cholo moves inside. The squeak gets

louder, the light brighter as he turns a corner and sees...

...a MIDDLE-AGED MAN, HANGING DEAD from a HOMEMADE NOOSE

suspended from a light fixture in the kitchen! THE BODY SWAYS

slowly, the harsh glare making the man's face even whiter

than it is. A toppled chair lies on the floor at his feet.

Cholo stands transfixed for an instant. And in that instant...

...HE IS GRABBED FROM BEHIND! He whirls, ready to kill, but

finds only a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN, 60-something, wearing a

tailored suit and expensive jewelry, her perfectness

blemished only by her hysteria.

Cholo shakes her, hard.

Behind them, in the kitchen, unseen, a dazed YOUNG MAN, walks

up to the hanging corpse. He rights the toppled chair and

steps on it, lifting a paring to knife cut through the noose.

INT. "THE ARENA" - DAY

RILEY and CHARLIE step into the CELLAR of an old BROWNSTONE.

Dirt floor. Stone walls. The place is filled with smoke and

BUZZING with FLIES. As Riley and Charley turn their guns over

to TWO BIG BRUISERS inside, a TOUT named ROACH sidles over.

Riley is already in. He has pushed past the Tout and is

striding into a fog where GAMBLERS are rushing to place bets

with heavily-armed BOOKIES. We're reminded of a cock-fighting

joint in a Pancho Villa movie.

high above all other heads, its peacock feathers poking even

higher out of a snake-skin hat band.

INT. BACKSTAGE - "THE ARENA" - DAY

In a dark CATACOMB, DEAD MEN are chained to the walls. WHAM!

A POLE shoots out. A NOOSE on the end encircles the neck of a

captive Dead Man and is cinched tight. TWO MEN hold the pole

while A THIRD sprays RED PAINT on the Thing's face. ANOTHER

DEAD THING is dragged in and sprayed with BLACK PAINT.

INT. BACK OFFICE - "THE ARENA" - DAY

Cursing in Spanish, CHIHUAHUA pulls a GLOCK out of a filing

cabinet and jams a magazine up its butt.

INT. CENTER RING - "THE ARENA" - DAY

RILEY and CHARLIE drift into a large room that's packed with

BETTORS hooting and hollering like football fans. They're all

jammed onto tiered wooden viewing stands arranged around an

IRON-MESH STRUCTURE that looks like a lion-tamer's cage.

Gates open. THE PAINTED WALKERS are thrust inside the cage.

Their nooses are released. The gates are locked behind them.

INT. BOARD ROOM - FIDDLER'S GREEN - DAY

A UNIFORMED GUARD leaves CHOLO in a PRISTINE WHITE conference

room with glass walls overlooking the rotting CITY far below.

Cholo sets the case of champagne and the box of Cohibas on a

conference table. A SMAN stands in SILHOUETTE at the windows.

Cholo opens the case of champagne. He pulls a bottle out,

untwists the wire, and uses his strong thumbs to pop the

cork. FOAM runs.

Cholo grabs a highball glass from a cupboard, pours champagne

into it, and brings it, overflowing, to the Silhouetted Man.

Cholo tears open the box of Cohibas. He picks up two cigars,

bites off the tips, puts one in his mouth, then, walking back

to the Silhouetted Man, puts the other in his mouth, lighting

them both with a wooden match that he strikes on his jeans.

Cholo lunges at Kaufman, grabs him by the collar.

Cholo feels the barrel of a .45 against his waist. Kaufman,

who has drawn the pistol from his jacket, is still smiling.

Kaufman presses a button under the table. THREE SECURITY

GUARDS rush in, GRAB Cholo, and drag him away. Kaufman stops

one of the guards at the door.

RILEY RIPS off part of his shirt-sleeve and starts to bandage

the wound on SLACK'S arm. They are in a jail cell that has

brick walls and a small barred window facing a dark alley.

CHARLIE, stripped of all his guns, stares outside longingly.

INT. BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

In a ratty bedroom, FOXY is wakened out of a snore by CHOLO.

EXT. DEPOT - NIGHT

CRANE DOWN FROM A FADED SIGN, TONY'S AUTOMANIA, high above

what was once a car dealership, but is now a fenced-in DEPOT

full of VEHICLES. A huge WHITE FACE with black cartoon eyes

POPS into view, attached to a TEN-FOOT-TALL BODY emblazoned

TONY BALONEY. It's one of those vinyl ADVERTISING DUMMIES

that does the hula as air pumps through it. Tony's arms wave

wildly, like a giant zombie, comic yet oddly unnerving as...

BLAM! BLAM! Bullets hit it in the face and neck. GUS, a young

soldier, and his partner BARRETT, are shooting outside the

SALES OFFICE of the car-lot-turned-depot. A sign is printed

on the window. "BEST DEALS IN TOWN AND THAT'S NO BALONEY!"

INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT

SCREECH! CHOLO pulls a CARGO CARRIER to a stop along the

platform of the tunnel. FOXY, PRETTY BOY, MOUSE, ANCHOR, and

SCAR, the youngest of the team, leap off the flatbed.

EXT. DEPOT - NIGHT

The steel doors under the "SUBWAY" sign open and CHOLO strides

out with his TEAM. A DEPOT GUARD steps forward as the doors

close and lock automatically behind them.

Cholo reaches down, but not into his pocket. For his gun.

Just before he draws it...SHOTS ring out.

EXT. DEPOT - TONY'S AUTOMANIA SALES OFFICE - NIGHT

GUS aims his rifle at the jerking head of TONY BALONEY. As he

is about to fire, there's a SOUND at his back.

The SOUND comes again. From the woods that adjoin the lot.

Barrett grabs the handles of a KLIEG LIGHT mounted on a pivot

and swings it so that it ILLUMINATES the tree-line.

T

erratic gusts of wind.

Barrett pivots the Klieg light back to its original position,

jumping out of his skin when the bright white beam reveals...

A DEAD THING within arm's length.

Barrett FIRES! The dead thing DROPS OUT OF FRAME, REPLACED BY

ANOTHER. BLAM! Barrett SHOOTS again. This creature collapses.

It is also replaced by another, which is also shot, as...

BLAM! The top of Barrett's head is taken off by a rifle shot.

The rifle was fired by BIG DADDY. The barrel is still smoking.

In the darkness behind him stands NUMBER NINE. Behind Number

Nine are the SHUFFLING SHADOWS of many more dead things.

GUS SCREAMS.

EXT. DEPOT - NIGHT

THE DEPOT GUARD turns and runs toward his men. CHOLO'S TEAM

unstraps weapons and gets ready for battle.

C

A GUNNER at a machine-gun battery opens fire on the WALKERS.

Many of the rounds SPARK off the wire fencing.

INT. DEAD RECKONING NIGHT

CHOLO and his TEAM scramble into the vehicle.

EXT. DEPOT - NIGHT

THE WALKING DEAD march through MACHINE GUN FIRE behind their

"leader". BIG DADDY. He is the first to reach the fence

surrounding the lot. Pushing against the wire, he is soon

joined by NUMBER NINE. Then OTHERS. The FENCE COLLAPSES. The

Dead Things SWARM into the depot.

VROOOM! DEAD RECKONING pulls out. Rumbling over the section

of fencing the zombies pushed down, it drives into the night.

SOLDIERS abandon their stations and scatter, shooting wildly.

NUMBER NINE knocks one of them cold with its baseball bat.

The soldier falls, losing his M-16. BIG DADDY grabs the bat

and throws it aside. Picking up the soldier's M-16, he

presses the weapon into Number Nine's hands, even arranging

Number Nine's fingers on the trigger.

RATATATAT. With the gun aimed at the ground, Number Nine

fires a BURST that sends her into a spastic dance. The

soldier sits back up. Draws a pistol. Big Daddy grabs the

barrel of the still-firing M-16 and guides it along the

pavement to...

...the soldier's legs. Bullets march up his groin, belly,

chest, and, finally, head. He drops.

ANOTHER SOLDIER attacks. This time, Number Nine aims her

weapon purposefully and scores a direct hit.

OTHER DEAD THINGS SMACK at the steel doors that lead down to

the subway. They can't get through. Losing interest, they

drift slowly away, until their attention is refocused by...

...a GRUNT from Big Daddy, who is gazing toward the GLOW of

the FIDDLER'S GREEN HIGH-RISE across the river, closer now

than before. The city. That's where he wants to be. That's

where he's determined to go.

INT. KAUFMAN PENTHOUSE - FIDDLER'S GREEN - NIGHT

KAUFMAN RIPS a TURKEY LEG off a cooked bird on a platter in

front of him and eats. Across the table sits one of his board

members, HARRISON SUTHERLAND. KNIPP enters.

Knipp brings a radio-phone to the table. Kaufman picks up the

receiver and lifts it to his ear.

Kaufman tenses, just enough for Sutherland to notice.

RILEY, CHARLIE, and SLACK exchange glances. What now?

INT. FIDDLER'S GREEN BOARDROOM - NIGHT

KAUFMAN sips a Scotch. SUTHERLAND is present, with a middle-

aged board member named CHANDLER STYLES and CLIFF WOODS, who

is young and ambitious. All of them are nervous, pacing. A

door opens and RILEY is ushered into the room.

EXT. INDUSTRIAL STREET - NIGHT

DEAD RECKONING RUMBLES along a dark street, plowing into a

DERELICT CAR, knocking it aside and rolling it down a small

embankment, pinning THREE DEAD THINGS beneath.

INT. DEAD RECKONING - NIGHT

CHOLO'S TEAM laughs raucously at the fate of the zombies.

EXT. INDUSTRIAL STREET - NIGHT

BIG DADDY steps out of the darkness, watching the lights of

DEAD RECKONING recede. He hears desperate SQUEALING coming

from under the toppled car.

He lumbers down the embankment. Pushes on one of the upturned

tires. He can't turn the car by himself. He looks back to the

road. Grunts.

NUMBER NINE and OTHERS OF BIG DADDY'S GATHERING FORCE hurry

to the car. They push. The car rolls over, freeing THE THREE

DEAD THINGS. One of them used to be a BUTCHER. Still wearing

a blood-stained apron, carrying a meat cleaver, he looks at

Big Daddy with something resembling gratitude.

INT. FIDDLER'S GREEN WEAPONS STORAGE - NIGHT

SOLDIERS pass out monster weapons to RILEY, CHARLIE, and

SLACK. Riley straps on a K-90. Charlie turns one down.

Charlie unstraps his own REMINGTON. A la Sergeant York, he

licks his thumb. Wets the sight. And BLASTS a COCKROACH

climbing on a wall twenty feet away.

TEAHOUSE steps forward. A mean-looking Asian right out of

Mortal Kombat. He joins his hands, as if in prayer, and bows.

Pillsbury speaks with a voice as deep as the Mindanao trench.

A LONG DOCK juts into the RIVER. DEAD RECKONING stops beside

it. MOUSE jumps out. CHOLO stands in an open hatch.

Mouse nods, running off to hide in a BOAT SHED.

EXT. DEPOT - NIGHT

The steel doors to the subway tunnel open. RILEY and his TEAM

step out. The depot has been DEVASTATED. FIRES BURNING.

FENCES DOWN. Only TONY BALONEY moves, still waving spookily.

Clouds of thick black SMOKE from the fires BILLOW across the

depot, restricting visibility. Ever-shifting OPENINGS in the

clouds reveal glimpses of torn BODY PARTS.

Riley lifts Teahouse's Motorola and pushes "Send".

INT. FIDDLER'S GREEN BOARDROOM - NIGHT

A TROOPER, equally alarmed, is reporting.

EXT. DEPOT - NIGHT

RILEY and his TEAM move through DRIFTING SMOKE. VEHICLES are

scattered about. They stop at the T-BIRD. There are no keys

in the ignition.

Tire fires BURN around it. Debris smolders.

MANOLETE climbs in and goes to work under the dash.

Suddenly, CHARLIE draws his .45 and FIRES AT SLACK! BLAM! The

bullet buzzes just above her ear, blowing a WISP OF HAIR as...

Slack turns to Teahouse.

She draws her .45, aims at Teahouse, and FIRES.

INT. FIDDLER'S GREEN BOARDROOM - NIGHT

KAUFMAN paces with a cigar, passing SUTHERLAND, STYLES,

Kaufman looks at Cliff, as if expecting him to understand.

Kaufman leads Cliff into...

the Security Guard drags Cliff away.

EXT. CARNEGIE - NIGHT

GARDENER in work clothes, drives back and forth, back and

forth, over a swath of dead grass. The gardener is DEAD too.

INT. DEAD RECKONING - NIGHT

CHOLO watches the GARDENER through the windshield.

CLOSE ON: CHOLO'S WATCH. 11:20.

Cholo slides open a small window, grabs his crossbow, and

SHOOTS the Gardener in the head.

EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

ANGLE ON: A SOLID WALL OF WOOD. BIG DADDY, NUMBER NINE, and

OTHERS OF THE DEAD push against it. The wood holds.

Big Daddy turns, surveying his troops. Focusing on the

BUTCHER. On the meat cleaver it has in its hand.

Big Daddy pounds on the wood, demonstrating. Points at the

meat cleaver. Pounds again. The Butcher gets it. Approaches

the wall.

REVERSE ANGLE: from the other side of the wall as the wood

splinters to reveal BIG DADDY'S EYES staring through at...

...the FIDDLER'S GREEN HIGH-RISE, looming closer than it was

before, though it's still across the river.

SLACK, driving the T-BIRD now, makes the turn. The car blows

through a deserted town, moving fast. Riley notices that

Slack is effected by the desolation she sees.

thick with tall CAT TAILS. Unexpectedly, Riley stands and

points his automatic at PILLSBURY and MANOLETE.

Riley reaches down and opens the passenger door. Manolete

looks out and sees the CAT TAILS MOVING. THREE WALKERS are

slogging through the marsh.

EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

DEAD RECKONING stops on a long road, at the end of which

stands...

...a MILITARY COMPLEX. THE BEAM of a SEARCHLIGHT sweeps back

and forth over the buildings, a sign of life.

INT. DEAD RECKONING - NIGHT

CHOLO checks his watch. 11:29. He speaks into a TRANSMITTER.

INT. SHED - 10TH STREET PIER - NIGHT

MOUSE stands in the shed, holding a transmitter of his own.

INT. DEAD RECKONING - NIGHT

CHOLO looks out the window to the searchlight sweeping over

the military complex in the distance.

INT/EXT. IMPALA - COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

SLACK drives as RILEY monitors his "Game Boy".

INT. SHED - 10TH STREET PIER - NIGHT

MOUSE looks at a GRIMY WINDOW as the SHADOW of a WALKER stops

just beyond the glass. Mouse FIRES a BURST shattering the

window and dropping the Walker.

Silence. Mouse takes a tentative step toward the window. A

SCRATCHING SOUND. SOMETHING climbs up onto the sill from

outside. Mouse raises his gun, but hesitates when he sees...

...it's a child. A GIRL SCOUT. It died at age nine, still

wearing its uniform. Now, it's voracious. It grabs Mouse's

gun-hand. The weapon FIRES harmlessly into the floor. Mouse

is about to be chomped when...

...a STALAGMITE OF GLASS in the top of the shattered window

drops, PIERCING the Girl Scout's head.

Mouse runs SCREAMING to the door, where he is grabbed by

another DEAD THING. And another. As he is TORN APART, he sees

that there are DOZENS MORE.

EXT. RIVER - NIGHT

CRANE UP TO REVEAL:

...AN ARMY OF THE DEAD LINING THE RIVERBANK FOR AS FAR AS THE

EYE CAN SEE.

CLOSE ON: BIG DADDY. Only the river now flows between he and

his goal: FIDDLER'S GREEN HIGH-RISE, so near and yet so far.

INT. KAUFMAN PENTHOUSE - NIGHT

WHAM! The door SLAMS behind KAUFMAN as he enters the foyer.

KNIPP emerges from the rear.

INT/EXT. DEAD RECKONING - NIGHT

PRETTY BOY eases the vehicle up the road to the complex of

buildings: ROSS PARK, a sprawling munitions depot.

The searchlight continues to sweep across the night, but NO

ONE is manning it. It's mounted to an automatic rotator on

the roof of the main building.

The gates stand wide open. There's no sign of life.

CHOLO punches a button. The SIDE HATCH HISSES OPEN.

Foxy moves out through the open hatch.

SCAR grabs his weapons.

EXT. RIVER - NIGHT

ONE OF THE DEAD TOPPLES face first into the water, dropping

out of sight. ANOTHER FALLS. BIG DADDY looks at the spot

where his brothers fell in. He looks for a long time, cocking

his head like a puppy trying to understand a high wind.

The first Dead Thing slowly rises out of the water. Then the

Second. They stand, waist deep, in the shallows.

Big Daddy gazes down at the water, a concept dawning. Then,

with grim purpose, he steps deliberately off the low wall.

Hitting the river, he manages to stay on his feet. Standing,

waist deep, with the others, he scoops up water with his one

good hand. Sniffs it. Tastes it.

He looks up. Sees the CITY LIGHTS REFLECTED ON THE RIVER. He

tries to express his thoughts. All that comes from his mouth

is a series of inarticulate moans. He's incapable of

transmitting his idea. So he does what he's been doing since

Uniontown. He leads. He walks toward the city. Out of the

shallows. Into deep water. Over his head.

INT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT

There are AUTOMOBILE TIRES, GARBAGE CANS, a rusted ANCHOR, a

sunken MOTOR BOAT, HUNDREDS of BEER BOTTLES...AND THOUSANDS

OF DEAD THINGS...WALKING...ON THE RIVER BOTTOM...following

BIG DADDY through the debris.

INT. TENEMENT - NIGHT

A knock on a door is answered by A MAN who looks a bit too

greasy to be important. SUTHERLAND is outside.

EXT. T-BIRD - NIGHT

The car speeds down the road with SLACK at the wheel.

INT. T-BIRD - NIGHT

RILEY looks at his watch. 11:40.

EXT. ROSS PARK AMMUNITION DEPOT - NIGHT

The unmanned SEARCHLIGHT scans the yard, casting intermittent

shadows.

FOXY and SCAR move toward a large STORAGE BUILDING where a

door swings in the night breeze, SLAPPING alarmingly against

the wall. Beyond the opening is a BLACK MAW, like a velvet

curtain, past which nothing can be seen.

Scar nervously pulls out a flashlight. As he CLICKS on the

BEAM, he loses his grip. The flashlight drops to the ground.

Scar reaches for it. His fingers tip it and it spins. The

beam WASHES across his shoes. Then Foxy's shoes. Then finds...

...ONE OTHER SHOE. Someone else's. Gasping, Scar grabs the

flashlight, shining the beam up onto what should be a leg,

but there's nothing left above its bloody shin.

PLIP! PLOP! PLIP! Beads of BLOOD hit the floor, dropping

from the DARK FIGURE of a SOLDIER who is approaching. Scar

aims the flashlight at the figure's face, recognizing...

Brubaker keeps coming. He has BULLET HOLES in his chest, but

they're not what's dripping blood. It's another half-eaten

FOOT that he's carrying. BRUBAKER IS DEAD. Foxy shoots him.

Foxy and Scar move into a hangar-like space. Pitch black.

Except for the mote-filled BEAM from Scar's flashlight, which

illuminates a supply of enormous cannon shells, lined up on

storage shelves. THE "JOHNSONS".

SIX DEAD SOLDIERS are hunkered in the shadows, EATING the

REMAINS of OTHER DEAD SOLDIERS.

Foxy grimly raises his weapon. As he squeezes the trigger,

the sound of the gunfire OVERLAPS into...

INT. DEAD RECKONING - NIGHT

ANCHOR and SCAR wrestle TWO "JOHNSONS" into place.

INT./EXT. T-BIRD - HILLSIDE ROAD - NIGHT

THE T-BIRD rumbles along a road lined with large HOMES, once

prized for their panoramic views. RILEY'S "Game Boy" BEEPS.

The display shows the RED DOT moving along a MAP.

Riley looks outside. Beyond the homes he can see THE CITY.

SLACK pulls into a driveway, stopping the T-Bird in the

shadow of one of the houses.

INT. BANK - FIDDLER'S GREEN - NIGHT

In a walk-in STEEL-WALLED SAFE, KAUFMAN pulls out banded

STACKS OF MONEY and stuffs them into TWO PRADA DUFFELS.

EXT. BOAT RAMP - NIGHT

ONE HEAD RISES out of the river. It's BIG DADDY, rivulets of

water running down the creases of his face. Another head

rises. And another. NUMBER NINE and the BUTCHER ZOMBIE.

More and more heads break the surface. The water FILLS with

BODIES emerging from the deep. HUNDREDS OF THEM. The CITY

LIGHTS REFLECT off their wet clothes as the ARMY OF THE DEAD

clambers up a boat ramp on the city side of the river.

EXT. HILLSIDE HOME DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

RILEY and HIS TEAM wait in the shadows of the driveway they

pulled into. They HEAR the distant GROWL of DEAD RECKONING.

Looking over a hedge-row, Riley can see HIGH BEAMS advancing.

Riley takes off. Charlie looks torn. He wants to go with

Riley, but he has to keep PILLSBURY and Manolete covered.

Pillsbury, moving fast for a big woman, POUNDS Manolete's

temple with a mighty fist. He drops like a lead weight.

EXT. ROOFTOP - FIDDLER'S GREEN - NIGHT

The door to the roof opens and the GREASY MAN from "downtown"

steps out of a fire stair with ANOTHER GREASY MAN. SUTHERLAND

remains inside the door.

The Greasy Men go trotting across the rooftop. As they climb

into TWO HELICOPTERS, we realize that they are PILOTS.

EXT. HILLSIDE STREET - NIGHT

RILEY walks down the road. The GROWLING of the diesels is

getting louder, the GLOW from the high-beams brighter. Riley

is startled by a NOISE behind him. He whirls around and sees

CHARLIE approaching.

Riley is about to object, when DEAD RECKONING comes rumbling

around a corner a hundred yards down the street. Riley checks

his watch again. 11:52.

INT. DEAD RECKONING - NIGHT

In the cab, PRETTY BOY eases off the gas. CHOLO looks out the

windshield as the headlights strike...

The vehicle crunches to a stop forty yards away. Pretty

Boy hands Cholo a microphone. Cholo speaks into it.

INTERCUT: BETWEEN THE STREET AND DEAD RECKONING'S CAB.

Riley holds up his "Game Boy". Cholo looks surprised.

EXT. HILLSIDE HOME DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

SLACK and PILLSBURY watch from the shadows as a HATCH OPENS.

INT. DEAD RECKONING - NIGHT

RILEY and CHARLIE step on board. PRETTY BOY is at the

controls. FOXY, ANCHOR, and SCAR stand nearby. Charlie is

grinning like a badly scarred Cheshire cat.

KA-CHUNK! Cholo lifts his crossbow, pressing a loaded arrow

up under Riley's chin. BLOOD TRICKLES.

Charlie is about to react when he feels Foxy's M-16 poking

into his back.

Cholo looks into Riley's eyes.

EXT. HILLSIDE HOME DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

SLACK and PILLSBURY creep forward, freezing as they see

RILEY with the crossbow at his neck. Slack aims her K-90 at

CHOLO, RUSTLING branches as she moves.

INT. DEAD RECKONING - NIGHT

CHOLO cocks his head outside.

EXT. DEAD RECKONING - HILLSIDE - NIGHT

With great WHIRRING SOUNDS, the vehicle's largest guns begin

to ROTATE slowly toward the city across the river.

MANOLETE begins to stir on the ground beside THE T-BIRD.

INT. DEAD RECKONING - NIGHT

RILEY keeps cool.

EXT. DEAD RECKONING - HILLSIDE - NIGHT

SLACK and PILLSBURY watch THE GUN TURRET continue to turn,

the cannon barrels angling toward FIDDLER'S GREEN.
