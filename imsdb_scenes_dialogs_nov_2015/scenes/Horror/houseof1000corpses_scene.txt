FADE IN:

INT. OLD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

We see a LITTLE GIRL dancing around in a grainy super 8 home

movie. A LITTLE BOY wearing a monster MASK enters the frame.

He struggles to lift a double barrel shotgun. He points it

at the girl and pretends to SHOOT.

She continues dancing. The little boy imitates her.

The camera swings over to some ugly, toothless relations

watching the show. They laugh.

EXT. SPAULDING'S - NIGHT

We open on a dark, lonely stretch of two lane blacktop.

Off to the side of the road we see a rundown gas station.

A weathered wooden sign proclaims CAPTAIN SPAULDING'S WORLD

OF MONSTERS AND MADMEN, sits atop the building.

A smaller sign below reads FRIED CHICKEN AND GASOLINE.

SHERIFF HUSTON, a tall southern good old boy, leans against

his dusty cruiser smoking a cigarette, pumping gas into his

tank.

INT. CAPT. SPAULDING'S - NIGHT

Inside is a poorman's Ripley's Believe It or Not.

Bizarre props and treasures of killers and monsters cover

the dirty walls. Wax figures of JACK THE RIPPER stand guard

before oil paintings by JOHN WAYNE GACY.

Perched on a stool behind the counter sits CAPTAIN SPAULDING,

a crusty looking old man in a filthy clown suit and smeared

make-up. The word LOVE is tattooed across his right knuckles

and HATE is tattooed across the left.

He is reading the newspaper, crunching on crackers from a

paper bag and halfheartedly listening to a small, nerdy man

wearing coke bottle glasses named STUCKY.

Stucky thumbs through a stack of autographed 8x10 photographs.

Spaulding brushes cracker crumbs off his paper and continues

reading.

Opens a drawer and tears off five stamps.

Spaulding SLIDES the KEY attached to a cow skull across the

counter. Stucky grabs it. Spaulding hangs on.

He lets go of the key.

EXT. CAPT. SPAULDING'S - NIGHT

From a STRANGER'S POV we watch through the window, Stucky

EXIT for the restroom.

Sheriff Huston finishes pumping his gas, gets in his cruiser

and drives off.

From this POV we RACE across the highway towards the front

door of the MUSEUM.

SLAM! We BURST through the door.

INT. SPAULDING'S - SAME

The moment of impact. BOOM. The door SMASHES open.

Spaulding's head JERKS up to see: a masked gunman, KARL,

wearing a LEATHER S+M MASK.

Behind him stands a second gunman, RICH, wearing a rubber

CAVEMAN MASK.

Spaulding obeys and raises his hands.

Rich exits.

Killer Karl steps up and puts his gun against Spaulding's

face.

Spaulding smiles wide, his teeth are yellow and rotted.

CLOSE UP

Spaulding's foot kicks a red switch, triggering a silent

alarm.

INT. SPAULDING'S - BACKROOM - NIGHT

A silent RED LIGHT FLASHES. In the dim glow, we see RAVELLI,

a large hunched figure, sitting on the edge of a bed. The

figure is heavily bandaged.

Ravelli reacts to the flashing light, he RISES and puts a

huge mask over his head. He EXITS the room.

INT. BATHROOM STALL - NIGHT

Stucky sits on the toilet pasting stamps on large yellow

envelopes.

Killer Rich KICKS OPEN the stall, GRABS Stucky by the neck

and PULLS him out.

We move around the outside of the building watching the scene

inside unfold. HEAVY BREATHING is heard.

Rich DRAGS Stucky into the main room.

INT. SPAULDING'S - NIGHT

Karl grows increasingly HOSTILE, knocks a candy display over,

raises his gun over his head and fires into the ceiling.

He looks nervously at Stucky.

EXT. CAPT. SPAULDING'S - NIGHT

From Ravelli's POV we watch through the window, as everybody

inside starts SHOUTING at each other.

Suddenly, Rich SHOOTS Stucky. Stucky FALLS BACKWARDS against

the wall, screaming in pain.

We move QUICKLY towards the entrance.

INT. CAPT. SPAULDING'S - NIGHT

Suddenly... CRASH! Ravelli SMASHES through the front door

knocking Karl to the ground. In the light we see that Ravelli

is wearing an OVERSIZED CLOWN HEAD. In his hand is a

sledgehammer.

Rich TURNS toward the COMMOTION. The Captain quickly WHIPS

OUT a GUN and FIRES. Rich falls dead.

Ravelli lunges at Karl, smashing him over the head with the

hammer. Ravelli's clown head comes loose and falls to the

floor. We now see that Ravelli is a bald pitbull of a man

with badly scarred skin that is painted white and red.

Karl hits the floor and begins CONVULSING violently.

Spaulding STEPS DOWN from behind the counter, puts his foot

on Karl's throat and points his pistol at Karl's head.

BOOM! Spaulding SHOOTS Karl in the head.

The screen EXPLODES RED, then TURNS BLACK.

CREDITS ROLL

Strange paintings of demons, monsters and bizarre creatures

fade up and move across the screen.

We see a BILLBOARD painted on the side of an ABANDONED TRUCK.

The sign reads GOD IS DEAD.

We turn to face the road as a car drives by.

INT. CAR - FRONT SEAT - NIGHT

Fast food wrappers and road maps clutter the car's dashboard,

a swinging monkey head dangles from the rear-view mirror.

Behind the wheel, the driver, BILL HUDLEY, 29, downs the

last sip of coffee before crumpling the paper cup and placing

it among the other trash before him.

Beside him rides, JERRY GILMORE, 30, slumped down in his

seat, reading a magazine with a flashlight, feet hanging out

the window.

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT

A LONE FIGURE in a cheap skull mask and white robe stands

hidden behind a billboard off to the side of the road. Bill's

The car drives past. We turn and hold on the billboard. We

see the happy smiling face of a young Captain Spaulding.

EXT. CAPTAIN SPAULDING'S - NIGHT

The car pulls up to one of the gas pumps. Bill and Jerry get

jacket, mopping the floor.

A dark haired girl, DENISE WILLIS, 27, sleeps curled up under

her. She removes a sweater from the top of the pile to REVEAL

the face of MARY KNOWLES, 29.

INTERLUDE

Grainy super 8 footage shows us an OLD MAN standing in front

of a small shack. His name is Lewis Dover. The shack is

painted white and covered with SIMPLISTIC RELIGIOUS WRITINGS.

Surrounding the shack are strange sculptures of various half-

human/half-animal creations.

INT. SPAULDING'S - NIGHT

Spaulding swabs up the last remains of blood from the floor,

he drops the mop into a bucket filled with water and blood.

Bill pays no attention, he is distracted by a strange object

in a glass case over the counter. In the case is a shriveled

up looking half human and half fish figure. It is the size

of a small child. A banner above reads:

AQUALINA - THE MERMAID.

Spaulding slides the mop and bucket behind the counter.

Jerry OVERHEARS Bill's and Spaulding's conversation and joins

in to help.

INT. SPAULDING'S - RESTROOM - NIGHT

The restroom is gray, dingy, a single exposed light bulb

hangs from the ceiling. The peeling walls are plastered with

ahead at a poster of RHONDO HATTON, a B-MOVIE ACTOR that

suffered from acromegalia.

excitement.

Jerry PULLS Denise over and puts his arm around her.

Bill grabs Mary by the hand and kisses it.

The kids wait.

The black metal door CREAKS open.

They enter the darkened room.

INT. SPAULDING'S - MUSEUM - NIGHT

Darkness. A blue light comes on. Spaulding is standing on a

MOTORIZED PLATFORM. He begins the tour, speaking through a

small megaphone.

A light rain begins to fall.

Denise puts some change in the phone and dials a number.

EXT. WILLIS HOUSE - NIGHT

PATIENTS wander the stark halls dressed in hospital gowns

and cheap plastic masks. Some are laughing, some are

screaming.

We move into a private room. Where we see DOCTOR SATAN

completely covered except for his eyes, hovering over a BOUND

AND GAGGED PATIENT.

We move off the doctor to a crayon child's DRAWING of a JACK-

O'-LANTERN. Tortured screams fill the room.

road.

INT. CAR - NIGHT

something hard and gets stuck in a deep mud bog.

Bill shuts off the radio.

A silence falls over the car.

Baby jumps up and gets out of the car.

on Freak Shows. Denise and Mary sit in the back, curled up

under layers of blankets and clothes.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

An old Gothic FARMHOUSE stands atop a hill at the end of a

long sloping dirt road. SCARECROWS with pumpkin heads hang

CRUCIFIED on crosses lining the drive. Everything is severely

overgrown.

Bill and Baby enter the gates of the FARM, they walk up the

main drive.

Baby runs forward and begins jumping around in the huge mud

puddles, then runs up onto the front porch of the old house.

The front of the house is covered with strange junk art.

Hundreds of dolls faces are nailed to the walls.

Broken bottles and cans are cemented together in weird HUMAN

FIGURES, ANIMAL SKINS stretched over bone armatures form a

makeshift roof.

Glowing down from the upper windows are grinning JACK-O'-

LANTERNS.

Baby RUNS OFF around the side of the house.

Bill stands looking off into the distance at the desolate

farm grounds. The rain continues to hammer down.

From BILL'S POV we see a silhouette of a LONE FIGURE walking

in the distance. The shape of a large dog follows behind

him.

Bill JUMPS, startled by the sound of the heavy front door

opening.

Baby GRABS Bill by the arm and pulls him into the house.

The heavy iron door slams shut.

Mary turns on the headlights. Denise lets out a blood-curdling

SCREAM. Jerry bolts up.

Standing dead center in the road is the GIANT SHAPE of a MAN

holding a heavy chain with a huge hook on the end.

Everybody scrambles to lock the doors.

On closer inspection, Jerry notices the chain is attached to

the back of a TOW TRUCK.

The brute man attaches the chain to the car and begins raising

it with his truck.

A SIGN on the side of the truck reads FIREFLY TOWING.

CLOSE UP - TV SCREEN

We are watching a scene from THE OLD DARK HOUSE. GLORIA

STUART, RAYMOND MASSEY and MELVYN DOUGLAS are standing in

the rain pounding on a huge wooden door.

We pull back from the TV to see Bill's clothes drying by the

fireplace. Bill, now wearing overalls and a flannel shirt,

is sitting on an old over stuffed sofa.

Baby sets down the tray, making sure to bend over close to

Bill. She hands him his drink and sits down next to him.

Baby moves closer to Bill, he begins to get nervous.

Finally, the SOUND OF A TRUCK pulling up can be HEARD.

Bill jumps up and goes to the window.

TV SCREEN - SAME

On the B+W screen we see DR. WOLFENSTEIN, a local horror

movie host. He looks like a cross between the WOLFMAN and

LON CHANEY in LONDON AFTER MIDNIGHT.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

Bill stands on the front porch watching as the truck roughly

jerks the car to a stop.

Jerry jumps out, opens the back door and helps Denise.

walks to join the others on the porch.

Her look says it all as she walks by Bill and into the house.

INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

Everyone stands around at the fireplace, trying to dry off.

Baby sits silently watching TV.

A VOICE from upstairs answers.

MOTHER comes into view from the darkness above. She is in

her fifties, but looks younger. A sleazy white trash queen.

She slowly descends the stairs.

Baby slowly rises like a defiant child and walks out of the

room.

They grin and bear it.

Camera moves over to the TV. THE END fades up on screen.

Dr. Wolfenstein appears over the credits.

INT. HOUSE - DINING ROOM

Bill, Jerry, Mary and Denise are now all seated around a

large dining room table. A thick mountain of candles sits

burning dead center on the table, giving off a warm glow.

Dozens of Halloween decorations dangle from strings over the

table, spiders, bats and black cats.

There is a hand-made PAPER MACHE MASK sitting on each plate.

Mother walks in holding a covered serving tray.

She sets the tray and goes back in the kitchen.

Everyone is speechless.

Tiny is over SEVEN FEET TALL and weighs THREE HUNDRED POUNDS.

He is wearing a black sweater with a big red skull stitched

into it. A red knit ski mask covers his face. Black gloves

cover his hands.

Tiny sits at the table, looks down at his plate and says

nothing.

Mother comes to fetch Tiny. She relays a message to him with

strange hand gestures.

Tiny gets up and leaves the room.

Mary just smiles, then gives Jerry a dirty look.

Mother returns to the kitchen.

INT. FARMHOUSE - GRAMPA'S ROOM - NIGHT

In a cramped, darkened room we see the huge shape of Tiny

hovering over a BED containing the hunched, fragile old body

of GRAMPA.

Grampa struggles to sit, then slowly slides his legs over

the edge of the bed. Tiny helps him to stand.

Grampa steadies himself against Tiny. They slowly walk out

of the room.

As they move into the light of the hallway, it is clear that

Grampa is in his late 80's.

Grampa quickly grows tired. Tiny picks him up in his arms

and carries him down the stairs to the dining room.

As they move past, the camera comes to rest on a STRANGE

OBJECT sitting on a shelf.

A LARGE GLASS JAR containing a DEFORMED BABY. The pickled

punk looks to have a small second head growing from its

temple. The label on the jar reads STUFFY 1973.

The sound from the TV fades up in the background.

BELA LUGOSI'S VOICE can be heard.

We see a tight shot of the woman's palm. A pentagram appears.

INT. DENISE'S FATHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT

We PULL BACK from the TV to find Donald Willis sitting in a

old easy chair. The room is modest, but comfortable.

the time, concerned look comes over his face.

The phone rings. He quickly answers it.

Disappointment. He mutes the TV.

Unmutes the sound on the TV.

The feast is on. Mother, Tiny, Grampa, Jerry, Bill, Mary and

Denise are gathered around the table.

Mother puts on her mask, Tiny and Grampa follow. Jerry, Bill

and Denise slowly raise up their masks, Mary hesitates.

Mary rolls her eyes and complies.

Grampa shifts his eyes onto Mother.

A voice from the shadows interrupts.

A PALE FIGURE creeps forward like NOSFERATU from a dark corner

of the room. This is OTIS.

He stands six foot, but is deathly slim. His skin is

translucent, glowing in the dark. Long thin white hair covers

his head. His eyes are grey. He is an ALBINO.

He is holding a GLASS JAR containing a SMALL FETUS. On closer

inspection we see there are two small bodies joined to one

head. The label reads WOLF.

Otis sets the disturbing jar of Wolf on the table. He leans

forward onto the jar, resting his chin.

The CLOCK on the wall strikes TEN.

Grampa hobbles out of the room.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - BARN - NIGHT

Billy, Jerry, Mary and Denise stand waiting in front of an

old barn. Tiny unlocks the huge doors of the barn and swings

them open.

Standing inside waiting is Mother. She is all dressed up for

the occasion.

Mother hands each of them a folded piece of paper, which

serves as a program book. Hand drawn on each is an orange

pumpkin.

INT. FARMHOUSE - BARN - NIGHT

We follow Mother inside.

Thousands of red Christmas lights hang down, strung through

the rotting wood rafters. Crates, barrels and an odd

assortment of chairs face a large quilted curtain. Filling

these seats are LIFELESS DUMMIES.

Mother motions toward four empty seats in the front row.

Jerry, Bill, Mary and Denise take their seats.

Mary flips open the program. Inside, written in crayon, are

the words: HALLOWEEN EXTRAVAGANZA -- starring the Comedy

Legend GRAMPA and the World Famous BABY.

The sound of a warped crackling record fills the room. Lounge

music.

A small spotlight hits the quilted curtain covering the stage.

Mother Firefly stands behind the controls.

She is smiling proudly.

The curtain clumsily parts TO REVEAL:

A stage set pieced together from amusement park wreckage.

A giant painted plywood devil looms over the stage, surrounded

by dancing skeletons and demon girls.

A microphone stands center stage.

The sound of CANNED APPLAUSE fills the room. Bill begins to

applaud, Jerry and Denise join in. Mary does not.

Grampa walks out to center stage, mic in hand and begins to

speak.

The kids stare in shock at Grampa. Jerry begins to laugh.

Jerry starts to giggle.

The recorded crowd chuckles.

The recorded crowd screams with laughter, as does Jerry.

Bill, Denise and Mary look at him like he's crazy.

The curtains close and the stage goes dark.

The stage lights come up. The recorded applause and music

begin.

Baby enters the stage. She is dressed in a home-made showgirl

outfit. She begins to dance clumsily to the music. She appears

to be somewhat intoxicated.

The vocals come on and Baby begins to lipsync to the song.

Baby makes her way down from stage on to floor level. She

gyrates and seductively TEASES one of the dummy audience

members.

Baby moves over to Jerry. Stroking her hand down his face.

Denise tries to look amused. Jerry smiles uncomfortably.

Baby strolls past Denise and stops in front of Mary.

Baby pauses and pinches Mary's cheek and winks. Mary is

FURIOUS.

Baby moves over to Bill. Mary watches like a mother hawk.

Baby sings and dances with all of her attention focused on

Bill.

Baby puts her arms around Bill's neck and sits on his lap.

Mary BOLTS FORWARD and SHOVES Baby off of Bill.

Baby crashes onto the floor.

Baby takes out a straight razor from behind her back.

Mrs. Firefly runs down from her position behind the spotlight

and intercedes.

SCREECH! The garage door slides open. Rufus has returned.

with a huge padlock.

LIGHTNING CRASHES, illuminating the crucified scarecrows.

FLASH CLOSE-UP CUTS - of grinning jack-o-lantern faces peer

down from above.

INT. CAR - NIGHT

Bill opens the car door, starts to get out.

Jerry, Mary and Denise watch through the windshield as Bill

struggles to unlatch the thick iron gates.

SUDDENLY, one of the SCARECROWS JUMPS down from his cross

and SMASHES Bill over the head with a HEAVY CLUB. Bill drops

to his knees.

Jerry throws open his door to get out. He's SHOVED BACK into

the car by another, larger scarecrow outside his door. This

scarecrow begins smashing the car's windows with a METAL

PIPE.

Bill lays motionless, face down in the mud. His attacker

turns his attention on the car. He also begins smashing the

car's windows.

EXT. CAR - NIGHT

From a distance we see Jerry pulled from the car and beaten.

The girls are helplessly trapped inside the destroyed vehicle.

The scarecrows continue to pound on the car.

As we fade out, the sound of a BARKING DOG can be heard.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - MAGIC

From a long shot, we see the farmhouse in the early morning

sunrise. All is still.

The sound of an engine starting breaks the early morning

silence. Rufus's tow truck is seen pulling away from behind

the house. The BEATEN REMAINS of Bill's car are towed behind

it.

EXT. WILLIS HOUSE - SUNRISE

Darkness, except for the face of an alarm clock. The time is

7:00 AM. TICK, TICK, TICK... BUZZZZZZ. The alarm goes off.

A hand reaches over and turns off the alarm. We hear a deep

groan. A light turns on.

INT. WILLIS'S LIVING ROOM - MORNING

Don Willis wakes up, having fallen asleep in his easy chair.

He sits up and wipes the sleep from his eyes. He runs a hand

across his head, smoothing out his thinning grey hair.

He picks up a phone next to his bed, dials a number, waits.

He holds.

Willis stands, walks to the window, opens the shades, morning

sun fills the room.

shelf by the window is cluttered with framed photographs.

B+W memories of Denise at the beach, RUDY the dog. High school

graduations and Donald Willis in uniform with the other

members of 56 Precinct. Donald is a FORMER POLICE OFFICER.

Paces.

Hangs up the phone.

INT. FARMHOUSE - OTIS'S ROOM - DAY

Mary opens her eyes, squinting into the light. Sunlight peers

through filth on the windows, fractured by the tattered

remains of rotted curtains. Peeling yellowed newspaper serves

as wallpaper surrounding the window.

Mary's eyes move across the walls to a painting of a BIG

EYED KITTEN. She stares at it and smiles. A look of horror

begins to appear on her face. She begins to scream

uncontrollably.

She is hysterical.

ZOOM BACK to see Mary wearing a dunce cap, tied to a chair,

facing a corner in the farmhouse's attic. This is Otis's art

studio.

Otis, standing before a large canvas, sets down his paint

brush and calmly walks over to Mary.

He spins her chair around, clamps her mouth shut with his

hand and leans his nose against hers.

Mary's eyes scream with terror, she nods yes.

Otis raises his paint covered hand.

Otis pulls back his hand, ready to backhand her across the

face with the book. She nods again. He lowers the book.

Mary stares dumbfounded.

She nods again. He slowly removes his hand from her mouth.

Mary tries to remain calm, but starts to hyperventilate.

Tears roll down her face.

Mary looks confused, but relieved.

Otis grabs the back of the chair and drags her across the

room towards a curtained off area.

Whoosh! He pulls her through the curtains. From behind the

curtain we hear Mary SCREAMING and Otis LAUGHING.

INT. CURTAIN ROOM - OTIS'S ROOM - DAY

Ugliness. Decay. Pain. Carefully arranged on a model's

platform is the severed torso of Bill sewn to a large homemade

fish tail. He is lying on his ride side posing.

Bill's face is frozen in a death scream.

Painted on the canvas is the gruesome scene of Bill as the

Fish-Boy.

Otis slowly puts down the canvas, turns and picks up a huge

hunting knife.

Otis draws back the knife.

Otis swings the knife forward, directly into the camera.

waving to passing cars.

EXT. SPAULDING'S - DAY

A police car drives past Ravelli and comes to a stop. OFFICER

GEORGE WYDELL, 42, a big, slightly paunchy man with a big

mustache and mirrored sunglasses, steps from his car.

Following close behind, OFFICER STEVE NAISH, 29, tall

athletic.

They walk to the door.

INT. SPAULDING'S - DAY

The door swings open. Wydell enters slowly, putting on his

best cowboy attitude. Naish follows suit.

Wydell, hands on his belt, struts up to the counter.

No one is around.

A rusted bell sits on the counter, taped to it is a

handwritten note, "ring for service". Wydell rings it once,

waits, no response. Rings it again, waits, no response.

Wydell begins ringing the bell non-stop.

Spaulding shouts from the backroom.

Spaulding enters from behind the curtain, angry. He sees the

troopers and puts on a phony grin.

Spaulding reaches out and grabs the picture.

INT. TOW TRUCK - DAY

We are cruising down the road. A bobbing head skeleton toy

glued to the dashboard wiggles with each bump in the road.

Behind the wheel is Rufus Jr., riding shotgun is Baby, dressed

in her Sunday best. The radio is blasting.

They speed off.

EXT. CHERRYPICKER RD. - WOODS - MIDDAY

The police cruiser maneuvers down the rough dirt road.

Bill's car is down in a ditch, run off the side of the road.

INT. POLICE CAR - MIDDAY

Naish checks the license plate number with his sheet.

EXT. PINK PUSSY CAT LIQUORS - MIDDAY

A small, crummy liquor store stands next to a sleazy motel.

A filthy looking hooker leads her customer to a waiting room,

a homeless bum stands screaming obscenities in the parking

lot.

INT. PINK PUSSY CAT LIQUORS - MIDDAY

The store is decorated for Halloween.

Off to one side is a curtained room. A sign reads "XXX 8mm

loops", sex noises can be heard inside.

Baby and Rufus stand at the counter waiting for the CASHIER,

a skinny geek with glasses, to total up their purchases. The

counter is loaded with bottles.

The cashier is packing the bottles into cardboard boxes.

Baby throws down three hundred dollars.

Rufus picks up the boxes from the counter. He and Baby start

to walk away.

Baby stops and grabs the flyer.

The flyer reads MISSING, KAREN MURPHY, 18. The picture on

the flyer shows the smiling chubby face of a young girl.

EXT. PINK PUSSY CAT LIQUOR - MIDDAY

Baby and Rufus exit. Rufus loads the boxes into the back of

the truck. Baby sits on the curb and lights a cigarette.

EXT. CHERRYPICKER ROAD - WOODS - MIDDAY

Bill's car is now sitting in the middle of the road. The

back is attached to a police tow truck. An additional police

cruiser arrives on the scene.

Sheriff Huston steps out from his cruiser.

INT. BILL'S CAR - WOODS - MIDDAY

Naish is digging around under the front seat.

Naish crawls out of the car.

EXT. CHERRYPICKER ROAD - WOODS - MIDDAY

Naish tosses them over the car to Wydell. Wydell fishes

through the keys, finds the trunk key and opens it.

We move around the car to see the nude body of Karen Murphy

laying in the trunk. Her arms and legs are hog tied. She is

dead. The word TRICK is carved into her side.

INT. FARMHOUSE BASEMENT - TINY'S ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

Water drips down from the leaking pipes above. Scavenging

rats scurry across the concrete floor.

In a far corner a single light burns, a child's Humpty Dumpty

lamp, illuminating --

Denise is strapped to an old wooden bed. She has been stripped

of her own clothes and is now wearing a blue checked little

girl's dress. Her hair is tied in pigtails.

She is cold and shivering.

BOOM. The basement door opens, heavy footsteps lumber down

the creaking stairs. It is Tiny.

Tiny is wearing an orange T-shirt that reads, "This is my

Halloween costume". For the first time we see the skin on

his arms, it is severely deformed from burn scars.

He is holding a small tray. On the tray is a box of cereal,

milk, a bowl and a spoon.

Tiny goes over to Denise, sets down the tray, and proudly

displays his T-shirt.

Tiny sits down on a stool next to the bed, he stares down at

Denise like a confused dog.

Tiny begins preparing her food, carefully pouring the cereal

and milk into the bowl. He stirs it with the spoon.

Tiny gently lifts Denise's head and feeds her like a baby.

Denise swallows the food, trying not to choke. After a few

spoonfuls Tiny stands up and walks over to a dark corner of

the room.

He pulls a string and turns on a swinging ceiling light. In

the light we see a rusty cage, inside are three rail-thin

female bodies.

Tiny throws the remainder of the cereal into the cage.

One of the bodies moves to eat the scraps, the others do

not. They are dead.

Tiny turns off the overhead light.

INT. POLICE CAR - LATE AFTERNOON

Wydell and Naish are pulling into a large truck stop parking

lot.

EXT. GAS STATION - LATE AFTERNOON

A rundown gas station sits off to the side of the road.

A filthy mechanic works on one of the many junked cars.

Two fat greasy men sit in the hot sun playing cards.

A Chevy Nova sits parked next to the station. Willis leans

against the side of the car, drinking coffee from a styrofoam

cup.

A police cruiser pulls up. Wydell and Naish step from the

car.

Wydell extends his hand, they shake hands.

Willis dumps out the remaining coffee, tosses the cup into

the trash and opens the back door of the police car. He gets

inside. Wydell and Naish climb in. The car drives off.

INT. FARMHOUSE - OTIS'S ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

THUMP!

CLOSE UP on a bloody, bandaged face. THUMP!

As we pull back to see Jerry, completely bandaged like a

mummy, strapped to a wall. His arms and legs are spread.

THUMP! Knives stick in the wall next to the body.

We pull back further to see Otis pacing wildly back and forth

in front of his TV, watching MATCH GAME. Grampa sits eating

a TV dinner.

Otis throws the large hunting knife at the wall next to Jerry.

INT. POLICE CRUISER - LATE AFTERNOON

EXT. FARMHOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

Wydell's cruiser turns up the road to the Firefly farmhouse.

It moves past the scarecrows and comes to a halt. The doors

swing open and Wydell, Naish and Willis get out.

Naish and Willis head off around the back of the house.

INT. FARMHOUSE - KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON

Dirty dishes overflow from the rusty metal sink onto the

surrounding counters. A large cat walks across piles of food

left to rot on a table. Boxes of trash and old newspapers

are stacked to the ceiling.

Music from a crackling radio is heard.

Mother stands stirring a large pot on the stove. A LOUD

knocking interrupts her cooking. She sets down her spoon and

walks to the front door.

Before opening the door she peeks through the curtains of a

small side window. She sees Wydell and runs from the kitchen.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

Wydell walks up the front steps.

INT. FARMHOUSE - HALLWAY - LATE AFTERNOON

Mother runs toward a door at the end of the hall. She swings

open the door.

INT. FARMHOUSE - OTIS'S ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

Mother bursts into the room.

Otis jumps up and goes over to an old dresser and opens a

drawer and pulls out an automatic revolver.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - SAME

Naish and Willis move through the cluttered back yard of

garbage.

The soft sound of moaning can be heard.

Naish and Willis stand in front of a brick smokehouse. The

thick door is chained shut.

The moaning gets louder.

Willis picks up a broken axe handle and begins prying open

the door.

Together they struggle to open the door.

INT. FARMHOUSE - SAME

Mother slowly opens the front door. The revolver is behind

her back, tucked in her apron strings.

She begins to close the door. Wydell stops her.

She opens the door.

She closes the door.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - SAME

Naish and Willis bust open the door to the smokehouse. Hanging

upside down inside is Mary. She hangs from ropes strapped to

the ceiling. Large hunks of meat hang around her in the

cramped room.

INT. FARMHOUSE - SAME

Wydell and Mother sit opposite eachother at the kitchen table.

Pictures of Denise and her companions are spread on the table.

Wydell takes notes as Mother talks.

Suddenly, Naish's voice comes over Wydell's walkie-talkie.

Pulls walkie-talkie from his belt to respond.

Click. Mother points the gun at Wydell's head and fires.

He falls dead to the floor.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - SAME

Naish hears the commotion over his walkie-talkie.

No response.

Willis runs to the car, he gets about halfway there before

he is hit in the back by a bullet. He stumbles and falls to

his knees.

He kneels silent, stunned. We hold on his face and watch as

his life passes before him.

A quick MONTAGE, we see the following images flash by:

A. A father and daughter together in happier times.

B. A child's birthday party.

C. A baby crying.

D. Willis and his deceased wife.

Otis fires another shot.

Willis falls forward into the mud, dead.

Naish sees Willis fall. Before he can react a voice calls

out from behind him.

Naish raises his hands.

Naish turns around.

Naish obeys.

Naish kneels down.

From a distance we see Otis standing over Naish, execution

style. A white puff of smoke comes from Otis's gun and a

distant popping sound is heard. Naish falls over on his side.

The scene fades to blood red.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

The house stands silent in the darkness. Lightning crashes,

a heavy rain falls.

Burning JACK-O'-LANTERNS beam from every window. Smoke rises

from the chimney.

It is Halloween night.

INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

CLOSE-UP TV

Dr. Wolfenstein is on screen smashing pumpkins with a giant

hammer.

The movie begins and we move off the TV to see:

Hundreds of CANDLES are lit, illuminating everything with a

flickering light. Music blares from a cheap stereo. BLACK

and ORANGE PAPER STREAMERS are draped from ceiling to floor.

Dead center is a LARGE OBJECT standing seven feet tall, it

is completely covered in paper Halloween decorations. A long

chain connects the object up into the rafters.

This is the Halloween party from Hell.

An intoxicated Grampa, dressed as FLASH GORDON, sits in his

wheelchair watching the TV, drinking MOONSHINE from an

unmarked bottle.

CRASH! CRASH! CRASH! Tiny stands in a corner tunelessly

banging on a large oil drum. He is dressed like a low budget

BATMAN, in grey long johns and a black bat mask and cape.

A drunk Rufus, wearing a bloody police uniform, stands on a

table SHOUTING along to the music through a POLICE MEGAPHONE.

Mother and Baby, both dressed as SUPERHEROES, dance around

the covered object. Both are swigging moonshine from jugs.

Mother and Baby start TEARING AWAY the paper covering from

the object in the middle of the room. They RIP at the paper,

spinning and dancing around in a wild pagan ritual.

As the shreds of colored paper fall to the floor we see:

Denise, Jerry and Mary tied back to back hanging from the

chain, each are dressed in a different animal costume. Denise

is a pig, Jerry is a donkey and Mary is a rabbit. They are

gagged.

Mother and Baby laugh at their helpless victims, splashing

moonshine in their faces.

Rufus jumps down, begins to spin the bound captives around

and around.

The room goes silent. All eyes are focused on the stairs.

A robed figure, Otis, appears at the top of the stairs, he

begins to descend.

Rufus waits at the bottom of the stairs. As Otis reaches the

last step Rufus hands him the megaphone.

Denise, Mary and Jerry struggle to watch as they in turn

rotate past the scene unfolding.

Otis walks closer to the rotating captives.

Otis stops the spinning of his prisoners and stands directly

before Denise.

He drops his robe, underneath he is wearing a SUIT OF SKIN

sewn together from pieces of Denise's father.

Denise stares in horror, tears stream down her cheeks, barely

able to comprehend the madness around her.

Otis moves in close and licks her across the face.

Everyone chants "Who's your Daddy?"

Slowly turns the chain to face Jerry.

Jerry's eyes widen in fear.

Baby rolls Grampa over to Jerry.

Mother moves in close to Jerry.

Otis grabs Jerry's cheeks and makes his face move like a

ventriloquist dummy, provides Jerry's voice.

Baby grabs Mary and does the same ventriloquist routine.

Baby rotates Mary around to where Gramps is seated.

Tiny, growing restless, begins banging on his metal drum.

KLANG - KLANG - KLANG. Rufus joins in, clapping his hands.

Mother, Baby, Grampa join in chanting with Rufus.

EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

The rain pounds down. A heavy fog hovers over the dense growth

of the field. In the distance, silhouetted by moonlight, a

gruesome caravan slowly moves through the night.

Otis, lantern in hand, leads the way. Followed by Baby and

Mother together under a large black umbrella. Next Rufus

holds the leash connected to Jerry, Denise and Mary.

Bringing up the rear, Tiny, shotgun focused on the prisoners,

and Grampa. Grampa is strapped to Tiny's back like a child.

He waves a flashlight back and forth like a search beam.

The group comes to a halt at a huge wooden structure.

Baby directs the light at Otis. We see that he is trying to

unlock a huge padlock attached to an iron door embedded in

the base of the wooden structure.

Otis unlocks the door and swings it open. He reaches down

into the blackness and pulls up an iron hook and wench,

attached to the hook is a chain.

Otis parts a section of the overgrown grass next to the pit

to reveal a rusty metal crank. He begins to turn the crank.

Slowly, from out of the pit, rises a coffin hanging from the

end of the chain.

Otis pulls the coffin over and lays it flat on the ground.

He flips open the lid.

Rufus cuts loose Jerry, but holds him steady by the neck.

Rufus cuts loose the gag.

Otis pulls out a gun and points it at Jerry.

Mother grabs Jerry by the collar and gives him a big kiss.

Otis cocks the pistol. Jerry starts to slowly move towards

the coffin.

Rufus pushes Jerry into the coffin.

Denise starts kicking and fighting with Rufus. Rufus tries

to hold her steady, when suddenly Mary breaks free and starts

to run.

Baby jumps with excitement and runs off across the field

after Mary.

Mary trips and falls over a small gravestone. She gets up

and stumbles back into a wooden cross. She tears the gag

from her mouth and gasps for air.

Mary turns toward the voice but sees nothing but wooden

crosses. She is in a homemade cemetery.

Mary turns 360 degrees, but finds nothing.

THUD! Mary is hit from behind, she falls forward. Baby JUMPS

on top of her and sits on her back. Baby is holding a large

hunting knife.

Mary screams in pain, as Baby PLUNGES the knife into her.

Baby STABS Mary again and again and again. Mary lets out a

long gurgling scream, then goes silent.

Baby, covered in blood, licks the knife clean.

EXT. PIT - NIGHT

Otis shoves Denise into the coffin with Jerry and locks the

lid shut. Through a CROSS-SHAPED OPENING in the coffin we

see them crushed together.

Rufus LOWERS the coffin into the pit. Once the coffin is

inside Otis slams the door shut.

Otis opens a small window in the door and lowers in a lantern

and a small tape recorder playing music.

INT. PIT - NIGHT

Enter Hell. The dim light of the lantern shines off the slimy

wet filth of the rotted wood walls. The stench of death and

decay hangs heavy in the thin air.

Denise and Jerry, cold and shivering, hang half submerged in

thick maggot infested sludge. Bits of animal and human

skeletons float in the muck, broken bones lay in piles along

the walls.

INT. COFFIN - NIGHT

Through the dim light, we see the tightly packed forms of

Jerry and Denise.

Boom! A LOUD THUMP is heard against the side of the coffin.

BOOM, BOOM, BOOM.

Suddenly, an arm breaks through the side of the coffin.

Another smashes through the top of the lid. The coffin begins

to violently shake. Denise screams.

Another reaches through, grabbing her feet. SMASH! The coffin

is ripped apart and Jerry is pulled away from the destruction.

He lets out a quick scream before disappearing into the

darkness.

INT. FARMHOUSE - LIVINGROOM - NIGHT

The spastic light of TV static strobes across the sleeping

face of Grampa. Beside him, Mother sleeps peacefully.

EXT. BARN - NIGHT

The rain has stopped. Tiny opens the doors to the barn.

He goes inside. He exits a few moments later, dragging a

huge wooden stake. He sets the stake down carefully and closes

the barn doors. He then picks up the stake and drags it away.

EXT. BACKYARD - NIGHT

Behind the farmhouse is a camouflage jungle, an intricate

system of ropes and netting is strung together to hide the

many automobiles beneath.

Rufus moves through the jungle. He stops and begins to remove

the netting from a car, it is Wydell's police cruiser. He

climbs inside the car, puts on Wydell's policeman's hat and

starts the engine. He drives off.

INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT

Rufus is driving like a maniac through the open farmland. He

turns on the overhead flashing lights.

EXT. FIELDS - NIGHT

The police cruiser twists and turns in the barren fields.

INT. PIT - NIGHT

Denise stands knee deep in the sludge. Broken bits of the

coffin's remains are scattered around her.

A soft moaning sound is heard coming from the other end of

the pit.

Denise cautiously makes her way to the bend at the end of

the tunnel. As she approaches, the moaning sound gets louder.

She turns the corner to see:

TWO PALE FIGURES in filthy hospital gowns hunched over a

shadowy object. Denise gasps. They turn towards Denise,

revealing the partially devoured dead body of Jerry.

The two bone-white ghouls are dripping with Jerry's blood,

they stare at Denise, then return to their prey.

Denise screams in horror and runs, turning down another twist

in the underground maze. She turns the corner and runs

straight into SEVERAL SLOW MOVING GHOULS. The ghouls are of

the same deathly white complexion, hair-less with flaked,

cracking skin. Their yellow eyes shine in the darkness.

They reach for her, but she breaks free and continues to run

into the endless stretch of tunnels before her.

EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

Primitive wooden crosses form a circle around a burnt piece

of land, approximately twenty feet in diameter.

Laying flat in the center is the large stake, Mary's body is

draped across it. Tiny is securing her to the stake with

rope.

INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT

Through the windshield, we see Baby jumping and dancing in

the fields with several large dogs. She is firing a gun as

she dances.

EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

Baby sees the car and raises her gun. She aims it at the car

driver. She waits, as the car gets closer she sees the face

of Rufus behind the wheel. She lowers the gun and begins to

laugh.

The car stops and Baby climbs into the passenger's seat. The

car drives off.

EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

Tiny lifts the stake with Mary firmly strapped in place. He

implants it into the ground. Her body hangs like a doll.

Tiny opens a gasoline can and begins splashing gas onto the

stake.

EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

Otis, face painted like a SKULL and wearing a priest's robe,

walks solemnly through the tall grass.

INT. PIT - NIGHT

Denise, waist high in sludge, wanders lost through the endless

tunnels of the pit. In the distance she hears high pitched

animal sounds.

A GHOUL rises up from the sludge behind Denise. It stands

silent. It reaches out a BONEY HAND with long curled

fingernails and grabs her hair. Denise screams and tries to

pull away. The ghoul grabs her with his other hand and pulls

her closer, CLAWING at her face.

Denise fights her way free, but loses her footing and falls

backwards, slipping under the sludge. She quickly resurfaces

and starts to run.

EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

Otis stands in front of the bound Mary, holding a pumpkin.

Otis places the pumpkin over Mary's head.

Tiny stands behind him holding a lit torch.

EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

The police car drives wildly through the fields.

INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT

Baby motions to Rufus to steer the car towards the fire.

INT. PIT - NIGHT

A beaten Denise struggles down a long tunnel. She gets to

the end to find that it is a dead-end. Behind her, FIVE GHOULS

move silently towards her, blocking her only exit.

The ghouls slosh through the muck, moving in closer. Denise

frantically looks for an escape, nailed into the wall next

to her are planks of wood forming a ladder.

The ghouls are only a few yards away. Denise climbs up the

ladder. They move in, clawing at her legs and feet, trying

to pull her down. Denise digs at the wood and mud ceiling

above her, trying to break free.

Denise is bleeding severely from the chunks of flesh being

torn from her legs. She digs wildly at the ceiling, suddenly

a board falls free and mud rains down to reveal:

STARS, the sky above shines through the hole. Denise smashes

her fists at the rotted wood planks, pulling free another

piece.

With all her might Denise grabs hold and pulls herself up

through the opening.

EXT. PIT - NIGHT

Denise fights her way through the earth and pulls her body

up into the night air. The cool air rushes to her lungs. She

crawls free of the hole, gasping for air.

She is safe. Suddenly... SMASH! A ghoul has broken through

the surface. He grabs Denise by the leg and begins to pull

her back into the hole.

Denise screams and begins kicking violently at the ghoul.

She breaks and crawls from the ghoul's reach.

EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

Rufus and Baby have pulled the police cruiser up by the stake.

Rufus and Baby stand on the hood.

Otis finishes his sermon, he raises his arm. Tiny raises the

torch. Otis drops his arm, signaling Tiny. Tiny throws the

torch onto the stake. The stake ignites into a huge FIREBALL.

EXT. FIELD - NIGHT

Denise pulls herself to her feet and begins to run.

The flaming object burns in the distance behind her.

Denise stumbles toward the road on two badly injured legs.

EXT. GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

Rufus, Tiny and Baby jump up and down in celebration, smashing

the police car. Otis stands transfixed by the flames before

him.

EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

Denise makes her way out onto the road. No cars are in sight.

In the distance headlights break through the darkness. Denise

stands in the middle of the road.

The TRUCK comes into view, it is a small cube truck.

Denise stands in the headlights, waving her arms for it to

stop. The truck comes to a halt.

She runs toward the passenger's side door and climbs in.

INT. TRUCK - NIGHT

Behind the wheel of the truck is Captain Spaulding.

Denise is shaking from shock.

Starts to turn the truck up the road back towards the

farmhouse.

Boom! The metal door leading to the back of the truck slides

open. Ravelli grabs Denise and pulls her back into the back

of the truck.

SLAM! The metal door shuts.

EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

The truck quietly turns onto the dirt road leading up to the

farmhouse. The jack-o'-lanterns still burn in the windows,

grinning their evil grin.
