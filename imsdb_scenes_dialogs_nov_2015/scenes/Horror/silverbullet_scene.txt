SILVER BULLET by Stephen King Based on his story "Cycle of the Werewolf"

FADE IN:

EXT.  THE FULL MOON, CLOSE  NIGHT

It nearly fills the screen, swimming mysteriously in the

warm late summer air.

SOUND: Crickets.

THE CAMERA PANS SLOWLY DOWN TO:

EXT.  TRAIN TRACKS IN THE COUNTRY  NIGHT - AND MOONLIGHT

CREDITS BEGIN.

A rail-rider comes chugging along the tracks. Aboard is

ARNIE WESTRUM, a big man in a strappy T-shirt and chino

pants. He is drinking beer.

He drains the rest of his own bottle of Rheingold and tosses

it to one side. Up ahead we see a switching point.

ARNIE throws the rail-rider into neutral, opens the toolbox

on the back, and brings out a big five-cell flashlight. He

shines it on the switch.

He gets a crowbar from the toolbox, plus a big wrench, a

pair of pliers, a hammer, and a pair of work gloves. He also

gets another bottle of beer and sticks it into his back

pocket.

ARNIE jumps down and approaches the switch.

CREDITS CONTINUE.

EXT. ARNIE, AT THE SWITCHING POINT  NIGHT

He drops his tools, pulls on his work gloves, and trains the

light on the switch for a moment. During this:

He tries the switch. No go. It's frozen.

He takes the bottle of beer from his back pocket and fishes

a churchkey from one of the front ones. He pops the cap and

drinks deeply. He burps. Then he screws the half-empty

bottle of beer into the cinders so it won't fall over. Then

he picks up his crowbar.

CREDITS CONTINUE.

EXT.  THE RAIL-RIDER  NIGHT

There's a SOUND of bushes shaking. Something comes out -

something huge. It leaps limberly onto the rail-rider. It is

a werewolf with greenish-yellow eyes. Tatters of clothes

still hang from it.

What kind of monster, exactly? It is humanoid as well as

wolfish... and when we learn who it is in its human form, we

should be able to spot the resemblance at once...and kick

ourselves for not knowing earlier.

It crouches there, huge and bushy and fanged and deadly, on

the whole rail-rider.

CREDITS CONCLUDE.

EXT.  ARNIE  NIGHT

He's working the crowbar into the junction point just as

hard as he can. Swearing at it under his breath. Suddenly,

both the tracks and the switch move.

He turns back toward the rail-rider.

EXT.  ARNIE, ARRIVING AT THE RAIL-RIDER  NIGHT

A NOISE - bushes rattling; cinders clinking and rattling.

ARNIE looks around.

EXT.  THE RAILS AND THE SWITCHING POINT, ARNIE'S POV  NIGHT

Nothing there. His bottle of beer stands by the litter of

his tools.

EXT.  ARNIE, AT THE RAIL-RIDER  NIGHT

He's rooting around in the toolbox, back to the switching

point.

EXT.  ARNIE'S BOTTLE OF BEER, CU  NIGHT

A hairy hand/paw closes around it - we see huge curved claws

on that hand.

EXT.  THE WEREWOLF'S FACE, CU  NIGHT

Glaring green-yellow eyes; a savage, beastial face which is

still half human. That's all we see. The rest is in shadow.

It opens its mouth and upends the bottle of beer. Foamy

Rheingold begins gurgling down the werewolf's throat.

EXT.  ARNIE AT THE RAIL-RIDER  NIGHT

He comes up with an old-fashioned oilcan, the kind with the

long spout. He starts back to the switching point, waving

the can.

He arrives, looks down... and stops singing. His eyes widen.

EXT.  THE CINDERS BY THE TRACK, ARNIE'S POV  NIGHT

We can see the hole where ARNIE put his beer, but it is of

course empty. Beside it are two huge prints in the cinders,

half wolf, half human.

EXT.  ARNIE  NIGHT

He's beginning to be afraid. Beginning to look around to see

what might be out here with him. Beginning to realize he is

in extremely deep shit.

SOUND: A SHATTERING, SNARLING ROAR

EXT.  THE WEREWOLF  NIGHT

It rises up on its hind legs, eyes glaring an ugly yellow

green. Its snout wrinkles back, revealing those teeth.

EXT.  ARNIE  NIGHT

He's craning back to look at the thing, his face a grue of

horror.

A huge clawed hand/paw comes sweeping down. ARNIE's head is

granted an immediate Reno-style divorce from the rest of his

body.

EXT.  THE RAIL-RIDER  NIGHT

SOUND of the beast approaching. A hairy arm and taloned hand

reaches into the toolbox bolted to the back and rummages.

The hand is dripping blood.

It comes up with a bottle of Rheingold.

The WEREWOLF begins to sing. It is a bizarre funny-horrible

grunting, the words hellishly recognizable.

No bottle opener for this thing; it brings the neck of the

bottle down sharply on the edge of the toolbox. Beer foams

out.

EXT.  THE WEREWOLF'S FACE, IN DEEP SHADOW  NIGHT

He/It rams the jagged neck of the bottle deep into its mouth

and drinks. Foam drizzles down its pelt. It's grinning.

EXT.  THE WEREWOLF, CU  NIGHT

The bottle is empty. There are CRUNCHING SOUNDS as it begins

to eat the bottle.

Blood begins to run out of its mouth; its face wrinkles in

pain and fury. It spits out broken, bloody jags of glass.

Looks up. It HOWLS.

EXT.  TARKER'S MILLS  NIGHT - MOONLIGHT

We're looking at Main Street of a small country town - might

be New England, might be mid-South. Might be 1984, might be

1981. This is Tarker's Mills, and in places like this, time

moves more slowly. Cars - not too many - move back and

forth. No one is in a hurry.

We see the Methodist church (and the parsonage next door);

Andy's Sporting Goods; Owen's Pub, with its Narragansett

neon sign. We see a barber shop with a striped pole; we see

the Holy Family Catholic Church and the rectory next door.

We see the Gem Theater, which is showing a revival of Sophia

Loren in "Two Women."

It's Our Town, U.S.A.

SOUND: The HOWL of the WEREWOLF - distant, a bit dreamy.

EXT./INT.  TARKER'S MILLS MONTAGE  NIGHT

a.) VIRGIL CUTTS, owner of Virgil's Texaco, is filling up a

car. We hear the HOWl... and VIRGIL looks up uneasily.

b.) In the barber shop, BILLY McCLAREN, the barber, is just

taking the apron off the Methodist minister, REV. O'BANION.

They both look around.

c.) Folks are coming out of the Gem Theater. They pause at

the sound of that HOWL and look toward the edge of town.

EXT.  THE SETTING MOON, CU  NIGHT

As JANE speaks, we see the moon sink below the horizon.

EXT.  THE RAIL-RIDER AND ARNIE'S HEADLESS BODY  NIGHT

Slowly the view improves, grows lighter, as we TIME-LAPSE TO

DAWN.

SOUND: A train is approaching. We hear its horn.

CAMERA MOVES IN. Here is a shattered Rheingold bottle. There

is a litter of ARNIE'S tools. And here, on the cheek of

ARNIE'S severed head, a few ants are checking things out.

SOUND: The train's horn, MUCH CLOSER.

And suddenly the train comes smashing into the frame, horn

blaring. The rail-rider goes flying. ARNIE'S body disappears

underneath. We see something flopping and moving under

there. It could be a bundle of rags. Could be... but isn't.

EXT.  TARKER'S MILLS TOWN COMMON  DAY

The common is more or less in the center of town, either

surrounded by Main Street commerce or backed by it. THE

CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY IN on a big tent that's been erected on

the Common - looks like a revival meeting tent, almost, but

the banner draped over the entrance reads: SUPPORT THE

TARKER'S MILLS MEDCU DRIVE!

Behind or to the side, on the grass, picnic tables have been

set out end-to-end. Women are putting salads and home-baked

breads on these - just about the whole town is going to sit

down to a meal when the meeting's over. Further off, men are

tending barbecues, roasting corn, etc.

Enthusiastic applause greets this.

INT.  THE CROWD  DAY

Most of the town is here, seated on folding chairs. We're

looking particularly at three people - NAN COSLAW, her

husband BOB, and their fourteen-year-old daughter, JANE. It

is JANE - a slightly older JANE - who we have heard

speaking. She is now a bit bored with the meeting, which has

been going on for some time. As the APPLAUSE CONTINUES, she

leans toward her mother.

As JANE gets up, the applause starts to fade a bit.

NOTE: JANE is wearing a silver crucifix, and will continue

to wear it through the whole movie.

INT.  THE PODIUM  DAY

To one side is a big black-and-white photograph on an easel.

It shows a van which has been customized into an emergency

medical unit.

Behind the podium are four chairs. REV. TOM O'BANION sits in

one of them. ANDY FAIRTON sits in another, red-faced and

beaming. JOE HALLER, the town constable, is just returning

to his; LESTER LOWE is just approaching the mike as the

applause dies. LOWE'S face shines with love and goodwill.

No amplification. He taps the mike.

INT.  JANE

She is making her way down the row to the aisle (the people

should be seated in folding chairs). She passes a GIRL of

about her own age who has overheard NAN'S parting shot.

She reaches the aisle and starts out.

INT.  THE PODIUM, FEATURING FATHER LOWE

He taps the mike again.

INT.  THE CROWD, FEATURING BOB AND NAN COSLAW

Good-natured laughter greets this.

INT.  LOWE AT THE PODIUM

A bit flustered, he taps the mike and is rewarded by a BRIEF

SCREAM OF FEEDBACK.

SOUND: Enthusiastic applause.

EXT.  A SNAKE IN THE GRASS, CU

It's a blacksnake... harmless, but big. It goes wriggling

through the grass toward a stream. In the b.g. - SOUND OF

APPLAUSE.

Hands - the rather grimy hands of a boy bent on mischief -

grab the blacksnake.

EXT.  MARTY AND BRADY, CU

BRADY holds the snake up. Both boys gaze at it with

respectful wonder.

NOTE: MARTY is wearing a silver St. Cristopher's medallion,

and will through the whole movie.

BRADY hands it over. As MARTY looks at the snake, BRADY

sees:

EXT.  JANE, COMING OUT OF THE TENT  DAY

Applause greets this.

EXT.  MARTY AND BRADY

Again we are fairly tight on the boys - we see them from

waist or chest height. BRADY snatches back the snake.

BRADY looks toward JANE. MARTY follows his gaze. His eyes

widen.

BRADY grins. MARTY assesses the grin.

INT.  THE PODIUM, WITH LOWE

EXT.  JANE

She is walking slowly toward the picnic area, and is passing

under a tree. There's more applause from the tent.

She looks up. The blacksnake dangles down toward her, almost

touching her upturned face.

JANE shrieks and bolts. She gets a little way, trips over

her own feet and falls down hard. She's wearing what was a

nice jumper and nylons. Now the jumper is torn and the hose

shredded at the knees.

EXT.  THE TREE, WITH BRADY

He's lying over a limb with the snake in his hand, laughing

wildly.

EXT.  JANE

She gets up, looks at her clothes, her bloody knees. She's

near tears.

EXT.  MARTY, AT ONE SIDE OF THE TREE, FAIRLY TIGHT

The shot's from the chest up. He looks sorry he was a part

of this little stunt, as he ought to be.

EXT.  JANE

She looks around at him in a fury of embarrassment and

something very close to hate.

EXT.  BRADY, UP IN THE TREE

EXT.  MARTY

EXT.  BRADY, UP IN THE TREE

He throws the snake.

EXT.  JANE

She dodges the snake with a little scream. She's beginning

to cry, but she flips BRADY the bird just the same.

EXT.  BRADY, IN THE TREE

EXT.  MARTY

He moves toward JANE - there is something queerly unnatural

in this movement, and in a moment we'll understand, but for

the time being we must be puzzled.

He's reached her. JANE is sobbing now, hysterical.

She runs away.

EXT.  THE TREE, WITH BRADY

He swings down and comes over to MARTY.

EXT.  MARTY

He's in a wheelchair, looking glumly after JANE.

EXT.  NEAR THE BANDSTAND, FEATURING JANE  DAY

She's walking slowly along, still crying a little. Now she

steps behind some bushes, looks around, hikes up the skirt

of her jumper, and wriggles out of the wrecked panty hose.

Startled, JANE looks around, instinctively yanking her dress

down. No one in sight.

Now she looks toward:

EXT.  THE BANDSTAND, JANE'S POV

A man who looks like he might be a traveling salesman who

has just stepped whole and breathing from a dirty joke about

the farmer's daughter comes striding down from the

bandstand.

STELLA RANDOLPH, a plump but sweetly pretty girl, comes to

the stairs but does not descend them. She is also crying -

but these are real tears, folks. STELLA is a human Niagara

Falls.

EXT.  THE GAY DECEIVER

B.g. SOUNDS: More applause.

EXT.  JANE

We can hear STELLA sobbing as JANE walks slowly toward the

bandstand with her panty hose still balled up in one hand.

JANE looks suddenly aware that she's not the only one in

this sad world who has troubles. She reaches the foot of the

stairs going up to the bandstand and tosses the hose

absently in a litter can.

JANE mounts the steps timidly.

EXT.  ON THE BANDSTAND

STELLA has retreated to one of the benches, where she is

bawling into a handful of Kleenex. Pudgy and twenty-two, she

is both funny and terribly sad. She looks around at the

sound of JANE's voice.

STELLA sees it is, and turns away from her, still weeping.

JANE stands, uncertain what to do next. After a moment she

approaches closer and touches STELLA'S turned back timidly.

STELLA turns to her, weeping still and distracted.

STELLA lumbers across the bandstand and down the steps. JANE

stares after her, bewildered and perhaps even a little

frightened.

INT.  THE PODIUM, WITH REV. O'BANION

INT.  THE TOWN HALL GATHERING

Most of them bow their heads.

INT.  REV. O'BANION, AT THE PODIUM

INT.  THE GATHERING

They raise their heads. Some echo the "Amen." Others cross

themselves.

EXT.  THE PICNIC AREA

People are coming out and getting ready to chow-down.

EXT.  THE COSLAW STATION WAGON  DAY

Traveling along a country road. Headed home.

INT.  THE STATION WAGON  DAY

BOB and NAN COSLAW are sitting up front. MARTY and JANE are

in the backseat. JANE is as far from MARTY as she can get.

She's still mad as hell. Band-Aids crisscross her knees.

MARTY'S wheelchair is collapsed in the cargo area of the

wagon.

NAN turns around to look at the kids - and it's really JANE

she's mad at.

Well, here it is - the chief source of JANE'S animus against

her brother and the source of most of the tension in the

COSLAW family.

MARTY winces and turns away a little, embarrassed - this

always happens. He doesn't like it, but he doesn't know how

to make his parents - his mother in particular - quit it.

In this traditional family unit, BOB is the Voice of

Authority. They all heed, although the atmosphere remains

thundery.

INT.  THE STATION WAGON  DAY

Train tracks run near the road.

INT.  THE STATION WAGON, ENSEMBLE  DAY

He crosses himself and they all look toward:

EXT.  THE GS&WM RAILROAD TRACKS (STATION WAGON'S POV)

INT.  THE CAR  DAY

INT.  MARTY, CLOSER  DAY

Craning back to look at the spot where ARNIE bit the dust.

His face is thoughtful, solemn.

EXT.  THE COSLAW HOUSE  NIGHT

JANE is lying in bed, her face to the wall. Dim light falls

on her unhappy face as the door is opened.

JANE says nothing.

INT.  THE DOOR TO JANE'S BEDROOM, WITH MARTY  NIGHT

He is in his "house wheelchair" - not the Silver Bullet (he

was in the Bullet during the Common scene, but we didn't get

a very good look at it). He has some stuff on his lap. A

box, for sure.

INT.  JANE

Her eyes are open but she says nothing. Just looks at the

wall.

INT.  MARTY

He rolls across to her bed and puts something on her night

table. SOUND of change and a rattle of paper. She rolls over

and sees he's put about three bucks on the table. Plus a can

of mixed nuts.

She looks at him and sees he's sincere - honestly contrite.

She softens. There's hope for these two kids yet, maybe.

She pushes the rest back to him, then looks at the can. She

picks it up, curious.

He gives her a warm, melting smile. When your little brother

is being good to you it's time to watch out - but JANE has

been lulled. She starts to open it, then looks questioningly

at him.

She opens it. A long paper snake - the kind with a spring

inside it - leaps out. She shrieks.

MARTY backs up the wheelchair so he's out of her reach.

INT.  MARTY, BY THE DOOR

INT.  JANE, IN BED

She tries to be angry with him... and cannot (this is a

response, we'll find, that both MARTY and his UNCLE AL

evoke). She smiles at him a little.

INT.  MARTY

He reverses his wheelchair, also smiling a little, and

leaves.

EXT.  TARKER'S MILLS, UNDER THE MOON  NIGHT

We're looking down at a brave little nestle of lights.

SOUND: A HOWL.

EXT.  A HOUSE SOME DISTANCE OUT IN THE COUNTRY

There's one light on upstairs and another downstairs... also

downstairs is the bluish flicker of TV light.

An ivy trellis climbs one side of the house.

SOUNDS: Canned laughter; TV dialogue.

INT.  THE LIVING ROOM OF THE RANDOLPH HOUSE

STELLA'S MOTHER, asleep in front of the TV.

INT.  A PRETTY CHINA DISH, CU

A whole bunch of capsules are dumped into it.

THE CAMERA DRAWS BACK to show us STELLA, sitting by her

vanity mirror. The rest of the room is reflected in the

mirror, including the window - we are upstairs.

[NOTE: It would be nice to see that fat moon floating in the

window!]

There's a framed picture of STELLA's ex-boyfriend on the

vanity beside the dish of pills. STELLA sets down the empty

prescription bottle the pills came from beside this picture.

We can clearly read the word "Nembutol" on it. There is also

a large glass of water on the vanity table.

STELLA turns the picture facedown. She might be crying but

probably she's not. She takes about five of the pills,

starts to lift them to her mouth-

A HOWL outside... closer.

STELLA looks around for a moment, then takes the pills with

some water. She pauses, looking at herself.

She takes another five pills. And another five.

SOUNDS: Rattling foliage.

EXT.  THE IVY TRELLIS  NIGHT

Claw-hands are seizing it and climbing. SOUNDS of hoarse,

guttural breathing.

INT.  STELLA AT THE VANITY TABLE

She takes another handful of pills... and the window behind

her shatters inward. There is a bellowing roar as the

werewolf throws itself through.

INT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WITH MOTHER

She sits up, startled awake.

From upstairs: ANOTHER SHATTERING ROAR... FOLLOWED BY A

SCREAM.

INT.  STELLA'S ROOM, WITH STELLA

She runs... and a huge claw-hand rips through the back of

her nightgown.

INT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WITH MOTHER

She runs for the doorway and the hall. From upstairs comes a

confusion of SOUNDS: roars, breaking furniture, shattering

glass.

INT.  STELLA'S BED, CU

One of those deadly claw-hands sweeps down the bed, ripping

through the sheets... the mattress... the spring itself.

Hairy, muddy feet with protruding talons leap onto it.

EXT.  STELLA'S WINDOW, EXTREME UP-ANGLE

The werewolf leaps out - it's graceful, savage, animal.

SOUND: A TRIUMPHANT HOWL.

INT.  THE UPSTAIRS HALL, WITH MOTHER

She's found an ancient pistol somewhere and is lugging it

gamely along.

She reaches the closed door of STELLA's room, vacillates

there for a moment... and then pushes it open and goes in.

A long beat of silence as we hold on the door.

MOTHER SHRIEKS.

INT.  MOTHER'S FACE, ECU

She shrieks again.

INT.  STELLA'S ROOM, WIDE

It's a total shambles; blood is splattered everywhere; the

mirror is broken, the picture of DAN the gay deceiver is

broken; the bed is torn in two. There are big, muddy

wolfprints on the remnants of the bed.

STELLA lies propped in the corner with Nembutols all around

her. Suicide may have been what she planned, but it sure

isn't what happened.

MOTHER SHRIEKS.

EXT.  TARKER'S MILLS MONTAGE  MORNING

a.) MR. PELTZER puts out his paper rack - just the

"Press-Herald" this morning. He looks shocked and grim. The

scare headline: BRUTAL MURDER ROCKS WESTERN MAINE. We can

see STELLA'S photograph.

b.) Through the window of Robertson's Luncheonette, we see

the proprietor, BOBBY ROBERTSON, talking earnestly with a

bunch of men. Among them: MILT STURMFULLER, ALFIE KNOPFLER,

VIRGIL CUTTS, BILLY McCLAREN, and ELMER ZINNEMAN, a farmer

we'll meet later.

c.) At Andy's Sporting Goods, ANDY FAIRTON is putting a big

hand-lettered sign in the window. It reads: REMINGTON

SHOTGUNS SINGLE ACTION DOUBLE ACTION PUMP PROTECT YOURSELF

AND YOUR FAMILY!

d.) At the Methodist parsonage, a '53 Dodge pulls slowly out

and MOTHER RANDOLPH gets out, weeping. As she approaches the

parsonage door, LESTER LOWE comes out and embraces her.

EXT.  A SMALL BRICK BUILDING ON MAIN STREET

The sign reads: TARKER'S MILLS TOWN OFFICE.

INT.  A HALLWAY, FEATURING A DOOR WITH A PEBBLED-GLASS PANEL

Neatly lettered on the panel: TARKER'S MILLS CONSTABULARY.

And below this: JOSEPH HALLER.

INT.  THE CONSTABLE'S OFFICE, WITH HALLER AND PETE SYLVESTER

HALLER slams the phone down with an angry bang. He looks

like a guy who has been up all night. PETE, his pudgy

deputy, looks like a high school athlete who has suddenly

found himself batting in the World Series.

He gets slowly up.

EXT.  TARKER'S MILLS CONSOLIDATED SCHOOL  AFTERNOON

It's a comfortable red-brick building on a side street. Ivy

climbs up the sides. Two or three rows of bikes stand along

one side of the building.

SOUND: The bell rings.

A beat or two, then the doors bang wide and a billion kids

spill out. It's the end of the first day of school, and they

are excited. They range from Grade 1 to Grade 8. Most kids

book it for home as fast as they can, getting on their bikes

and riding or just running.

Everyone has a pink report card.

EXT.  A BUNCH OF KIDS, WITH BRADY KINCAID AND TAMMY

STURMFULLER

BRADY and TAMMY are riding bikes. Now there is the SOUND of

a gasoline engine, and MARTY catches up. He's got the Silver

Bullet's motor running for the first time in the movie.

Later on it will sound extremely powerful, like a racing

car, but now it just sounds like a big lawnmower engine with

a muffler on it. It's pretty cool, though - a bright

metallic silver with flame decals on the motor housing.

Looks sort of like something Big Daddy Roth might have

thought up. On the back is a license plate which says SILVER

BULLET.

TAMMY laughs.

EXT.  THE CORNER OF MAIN AND WALNUT, A WIDER SHOT  AFTERNOON

TAMMY and MARTY watch as BRADY zooms off toward home on his

bike.

MARTY pushes in a hand clutch and moves a small lever. He

bumps down over the curb and they cross the street side by

side, TAMMY on her bike, MARTY in his wheelchair.

EXT.  MARTY AND TAMMY FROM THE FAR CURB, REVERSE

He pops up over the curbing with a bounce. He shoves in the

little hand clutch and revs the engine. Va-room!

EXT.  A STREET ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN, WITH MARTY AND

TAMMY

The other kids are gone; they are alone. The sidewalk has

ended and they roll slowly along the dirt verge of the road.

They look toward:

EXT.  THE RANDOLPH HOUSE, MARTY AND TAMMY'S POV

The driveway is blocked off with a sawhorse bearing the

stenciled words POLICE INVESTIGATION. The yard is filled

with cop cars - HALLER'S constable car, plus a number of

state police vehicles. Uniformed men come and go.

We can see a large black wreath on the door.

EXT.  MARTY AND TAMMY

TAMMY stops her bike. She's on the verge of tears.

He gets the Silver Bullet moving again, and she has to pedal

along to catch up.

EXT.  THE STURMFULLER DRIVEWAY, WITH MARTY AND TAMMY

They stop at the end.

EXT.  OLD GREENHOUSE, MARTY AND TAMMY'S POV

It stands a bit behind the house itself. A creepy place.

Many of the glass panes are broken; some of these - not many

- have been blocked with cardboard. The inside is a jungle

of plants that have run to riot. In the f.g. is a

mucky-looking garden patch where nothing much is growing.

EXT.  MARTY AND TAMMY

She is quite deeply troubled.

EXT.  THE STURMFULLER HOUSE, WITH MILT

Oh my suds and body, here is the Great American Alcoholic

for sure - the rural version. MILT is wearing a suit of

pee-stained thermal underwear. He's wearing a baseball cap

with the word "Caterpillar" on the front and has a bottle of

beer in one hand (I'm pretty sure that his beer is Rheingold

the dry beer). With his other hand he is busily scratching

his crotch.

EXT.  THE GREENHOUSE

Sinister...spooky.

EXT.  MARTY AND TAMMY

She smiles at him, bends over, and kisses him on the mouth.

MARTY is stunned... but happy.

EXT.  THE WHEELCHAIR "DASHBOARD," MARTY'S POV

There's a gas gauge here, and the needle is almost on "E."

EXT.  MARTY AND TAMMY

She waves and goes biking down the driveway as MARTY motors

back onto the street and turns toward town.

EXT.  TAMMY

She brings her bike to a stop by her father.

Having delivered this pearl of wisdom, MILT goes inside, now

scratching his ass. TAMMY pauses a moment and looks toward

THE CAMERA, her face troubled and scared.

EXT.  THE DESERTED GREENHOUSE, TAMMY'S VIEW

EXT.  MARTY

He's buzzing along toward downtown, which is still some

distance away - but at least he's made it back to the

sidewalk again.

He looks down at:

EXT.  THE WHEELCHAIR GAS GAUGE, MARTY'S POV

Now the needle is lying all the way over on "E."

EXT.  VIRGIL'S TEXACO  LATE AFTERNOON

MARTY pulls in. The wheelchair motor starts to pop and lug

and misfire. The chair makes it to the first pump on the

island closest to the street and then stalls as VIRGIL CUTTS

comes over.

MARTY laughs; VIRGIL starts carefully pumping gas into the

Silver Bullet's small tank.

EXT.  THE COSLAW HOUSE  NIGHT

Overhead is the moon, three days past the full.

INT.  THE KITCHEN DOORWAY, WITH NAN COSLAW  NIGHT

She's wiping her hands with a dishtowel and looks like she

just bit into a lemon.

INT.  THE DEN, WITH UNCLE AL AND MARTY  NIGHT

UNCLE AL is the family's sheep of a darker color. He's

thirty, good-looking, raffish. He's also drunk. He's got

both whiskey and beer. An ashtray beside him overflows with

butts.

He and MARTY are playing draw poker for MARTY'S baseball

cards. Each has a pile in front of him.

MARTY really loves UNCLE AL... his eyes just glow when he

looks at him.

He tosses in three baseball cards.

He grabs one of MARTY'S cards, looks at it, and tosses it

back.

He swallows whiskey and chases it with beer.

INT.  THE DEN, A WIDER ANGLE

NAN comes briskly over. She's seen and heard enough. She

favors UNCLE AL with a glare and then looks protectively at

MARTY.

She starts to wheel him away.

He means it, drunk or not. She reluctantly rolls MARTY back

to the table.

UNCLE AL lays down his hand.

INT.  THE STAIRWELL OF THE COSLAW HOME

MARTY is sitting in a stair chair that rises slowly to the

second floor. He looks dejected and glum.

SOUND of NAN hectoring her brother AL. I don't think we can

make out all of what's going on, but we've all known women

like NAN and I think we can fill in the blanks. "Christian

household... you come here drunk and expect... can't even

bother to call ahead..." Etc., etc.

A wheelchair stands on the second-floor landing. This one is

no Silver Bullet, only the more humble sort that moves by

arm power. When the stair chair clicks to a stop, MARTY

hoists himself from it into the wheelchair and rolls down

the hall toward the bathroom.

Below, NAN'S rant is still going on.

INT.  THE DEN, WITH NAN AND UNCLE AL  NIGHT

UNCLE AL is clearing up in a kind of drunken stupor- and I

mean he is really drunk. He's smoking one cigarette; another

is smoldering away in the heaping ashtray. He drops a pile

of baseball cards on the floor and bonks his head on the

table bending down to pick them up.

AL straightens up. There is a sort of command force in this

man, and here he is partly able to rise above his abysmal

drunkenness so we can see it.

She leaves the room, almost crying. UNCLE AL looks after

her, and then his attention is drawn to the smoldering

ashtray. He pours beer over the mess, putting out the fire

but creating something that looks even worse. He begins

drunkenly picking up again.

INT.  THE UPSTAIRS COSLAW BATHROOM

MARTY, now in pj's, is brushing his teeth.

JANE comes in- she's wearing a nightie.

He lunges at her, but JANE steps back easily. MARTY

overbalances and falls out of the wheelchair. His toothbrush

clatters across the tile.

She looks around swiftly, then bends down.

INT.  MARTY AND JANE, A MUCH CLOSER SHOT

One of MARTY'S cheeks is pressed against the floor. His eyes

are shut. He's weeping.

SOUND of her climbing the stairs.

JANE throws a quick look back over her shoulder and then

helps MARTY up in his chair. He helps by pulling on the sink

counter. JANE has time to give MARTY one quick look- "Please

don't tell on me," it says.

NAN comes in.

He bats his eyes at her.

JANE picks up his toothbrush.

But JANE stalks off. MARTY is grinning. It was a good

put-down.

EXT.  THE STURMFULLER HOUSE  NIGHT

We can see the moon in the sky beyond the ruined greenhouse.

THE CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY TOWARD the greenhouse. We begin to

pick up SOUNDS: RATTLING...RUSTLING...and low animal GRUNTS.

INT.  TAMMY'S BEDROOM  NIGHT

She's deeply asleep.

INT.  THE LIVING ROOM  NIGHT

"Big-time Wrestling" on the TV. SOUND of a refrigerator door

closing. MILT STURMFULLER comes into the living room from

the kitchen. He's wearing his long johns with the designer

pee stains and has a quart bottle of Rheingold the dry beer

in each hand. He sits down, looking at the TV.

EXT.  THE GREENHOUSE  NIGHT

More noises. There is a beat of silence, and then something-

one of those earthen plant pots, I think- falls over and

SHATTERS.

INT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WITH MILT

He looks up briefly- he's heard something- but the crowd on

the TV is loud and the match is reaching its climax.

EXT.  THE GREENHOUSE, CLOSER

A LOW SNARL. Plants shake and shiver. Another crash, LOUDER.

INT.  MILT, IN THE LIVING ROOM

Looks toward the window. He gets up, goes over, and looks

out.

EXT.  THE GREENHOUSE, MEDIUM-LONG (MILT'S POV)

SOUND of another crash. Plants move.

INT.  THE HALL, WITH MILT

He takes a shotgun from the wall, breaks it, and looks

inside.

INT.  THE STURMFULLER GREENHOUSE  NIGHT

The door at the end SCREECHES OPEN and MILT, still holding

the shotgun at port arms, comes cautiously in. This place is

really overgrown.

MILT advances slowly into the jungle of plants, and the

director will shoot it as he likes to build the suspense.

I'm sure that plants brush his face, and a bug or two- maybe

even a big plump spider- will land on him.

He hears a SCUTTERING SOUND and whirls.

INT.  GREENHOUSE FLOOR, MILT'S POV  NIGHT

A mouse goes running across the warped boards (which have

pulled apart from each other, showing deep cracks between).

INT.  MILT  NIGHT

He relaxes and starts forward again. We keep expecting it to

happen, but it keeps not happening.

Then, as MILT is starting back toward the door, two big,

hairy arms come up through the floor- bursting through two

of those cracks and shoving the splintered boards upward-

and grab MILT'S legs at the knees.

SOUNDS: BESTIAL ROARS.

MILT screams and triggers off the shotgun- unfortunately, it

is pointing straight up. Glass showers down on him. He is

pulled down into the shattered hole- now we can see him only

from the knees up.

INT.  TAMMY STURMFULLER'S BEDROOM

She sits up in bed.

SOUNDS of ROARS and MILT SCREAMING from the greenhouse.

MRS. STURMFULLER, in a nightgown with her hair done up in

rollers, comes into Tammy's room.

SOUND: Another SCREAM from the greenhouse.

INT.  THE GREENHOUSE, WITH MILT

He's now waist deep in the hole in the floor, surrounded by

broken, splintered boards.

SOUNDS: RIPPING FLESH, CRUNCHING BONES. MILT SHRIEKS.

He is abruptly jerked downward again. He is being eaten from

the feet up. As he's jerked down, one of the leaning,

splintered boards rams into his chest. MILT collapses over

it like an old Roman collapsing on his sword.

A hairy arm reaches up and grabs his neck. MILT is jerked

all the way into the hole, board and all.

EXT.  THE GREENHOUSE, FROM TAMMY'S BEDROOM WINDOW

SOUNDS of SNARLS, GROWLS, GRUNTS.

INT.  TAMMY AND MRS. STURMFULLER

They are hugging each other, terrified, by the window.

EXT.  THE STURMFULLER PLACE, MEDIUM-LONG  DAY

The police cars are now here. There's also a meat wagon. As

we watch, a number of cops- JOE HALLER and PETE SYLVESTER

are among them- approach the wagon. Many are carrying canvas

bags.

EXT.  THE STURMFULLER YARD, FEATURING PETE SYLVESTER

He drops the blood stained bag he's carrying, runs to the

bushes, and noisily blows his groceries.

EXT.  TARKER'S MILLS MONTAGE #3  DUSK

a.) On Oak Street, MRS. THAYER is hurrying toward home,

obviously spooked. She keeps looking behind herself and

nearly flies up the steps to her house. Then there is the

endless business of fumbling with her keys. Finally she

lurches inside and slams the door.

b.) On Main Street, at the Holy Family rectory, FATHER

O'BANION is closing the shutters...and locking them.

c.) On a residential street, a kid is playing with some

plastic trucks outside of a picket fence. Except for him,

the street is deserted. His mother comes out and hauls him

in.

d.) ANDY FAIRTON, in the sporting-goods store, checks an

automatic pistol and then holsters it on his hip. He has a

pugnacious, unpleasant look.

e.) BILLY McCLAREN turns the sign on the door of his barber

shop from OPEN to CLOSED, looks out warily at the street (to

make sure there are no psycho killers out there for trims, I

guess), then leaves and locks the door behind him. THE

CAMERA FOLLOWS him down a couple of store fronts to Owen's,

where he also goes in.

f.) The paper rack in front of Peltzer's Drug/ The

"Press-Herald" headline is a sixteen-pointer: MANIAC CLAIMS

SECOND VICTIM.

EXT.  MARTY AND BRADY KINCAID  MAGIC HOUR

They're flying kites on the common. Some distance in the

b.g. is the bandstand. MARTY is of course flying his kite as

he sits in the Silver Bullet. The boys are having a blast.

THE CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES AWAY from the boys, centers on

Owen's Pub across the street, and ZOOMS IN.

In the window is a poster. It reads: $10,000 REWARD FOR

INFORMATION LEADING TO THE CAPTURE OF THE MAN (OR ANIMAL)

WHO KILLED STELLA RANDOLPH AND MILTON STURMFULLER. And, at

the bottom: TARKER'S MILLS CITIZENS' COMMITTEE.

Along comes ANDY FAIRTON. He goes into the pub.

INT.  OWEN'S PUB

At a f.g. table: VIRGIL CUTTS, BOBBY ROBERTSON, ELMER

ZINNEMAN, and his brother PORTER ZINNEMAN. Behind them, at

the bar, we see PETE SYLVESTER having a beer with BILLY

McCLAREN. As we look around the bar, we will also see FATHER

LESTER LOWE, sitting at an unobtrusive corner table, nursing

a beer and listening closely to the conversation.

ANDY FAIRTON has joined the group. He sits down uninvited.

PETE looks around at this. Being the deputy constable and

ineffectual by nature, he's pretty sensitive.

INT.  BILLY McCLAREN, AT THE BAR

He's looking toward the table where the Fairton group sits.

INT.  THE FAIRTON TABLE

OWEN KNOPFLER comes over.

EXT.  A TREE, WITH BRADY'S SMILE-KITE STUCK IN IT  DUSK

SOUND of panting.

MARTY comes into the frame, pulling himself up by the arms.

His arms are very strong, although his legs trail limply

behind him (like the tail of a kite). He sits on a branch,

untangles the kite and the string, and looks down.

EXT.  THE FOOT OF THE TREE, WITH BRADY

As the kite flutters down, JANE comes biking up.

EXT.  MARTY, IN THE TREE

He descends, then hangs from the lowest branch.

EXT.  MARTY AND JANE

But she pushes the chair over and MARTY drops into it. He

pushes the starter and the Silver Bullet fires up.

EXT.  BRADY, FLYING HIS KITE ON THE COMMON  DUSK

BRADY could give a shit if MARTY'S in trouble. He just waves

vaguely. He's into the kite-flying experience, as the folks

in Marin County might say.

EXT.  MARTY AND JANE

He's looking toward the common, frowning and uncertain.

She starts biking away. MARTY starts after her, pauses, and

looks at:

EXT.  BRADY, ON THE COMMON  DUSK

CAMERA PANS SLOWLY UP to the yellow smile-kite in the

bluish-purple sky.

INT.  OWEN'S PUB  LATE DUSK

The former patrons are still here, with the exceptions of

LOWE, BILLY McCLAREN, and BOBBY ROBERTSON. Many others have

appeared; this is Happy Hour. Among them we see MR.

ASPINALL, the principal, and PELTZER, the druggist. A

barmaid, NORMA, circulates with drinks and beers.

Speaking of beer, ANDY FAIRTON has gotten through a fair

amount of Schlitz. It hasn't mellowed him, however; he's

more belligerent than ever.

INT.  THE DOOR OF OWEN'S PLACE

It opens and a man in a business suit- HERB KINCAID- comes

in. He is carrying a briefcase and he looks worried.

INT.  THE GROUP AT THE FAIRTON TABLE

INT.  THE BAR, WITH OWEN KNOPFLER

He reaches under the bar and comes out with a baseball bat.

Burned into the side of the bat, so it reads vertically

toward the handle, is the word "peacemaker." OWEN hurries

around the bar with it.

INT.  THE FAIRTON GROUP

PETE is standing in front of ANDY, fists balled up, fat face

trembling with determination.

ANDY gets up, infuriated. There's apparently going to be a

brawl. Behind them, HERB KINCAID has approached the table.

HERB hasn't even noticed what's going on; he's got problems

of his own.

INT.  HERB KINCAID

He clears his throat. This is a mild, timid man- he doesn't

like to speak in public, particularly not in a bar, but the

imperatives of the situation demand it right now.

INT.  THE PUB, A NEW ANGLE

Everyone looks at HERB. Conversation stops. ANDY and PETE

freeze with their fists balled up, like little kids playing

statues tag. OWEN is caught a little distance from ANDY and

PETE, with the "peacemaker" still in his hands.

EXT.  THE TOWN COMMON, LONG

Now it is almost completely dark, and a large reddish summer

moon is rising over the horizon.

SOUND: A LONG, WAVERING WOLF HOWL... LOUD.

INT.  OWEN'S PUB

All conversation has stopped. All have turned toward the

door and the windows; all hear the HOWL. Deep fright

overlies each face.

NORMA drops her tray. Glasses and bottles shatter.

INT.  THE MAIN CORRIDOR OF THE TOWN HALL

JOE HALLER comes out of the constable's office in a hurry,

letting the door bang the wall. He's buckling on his gun

belt.

EXT.  THE BANDSTAND

BRADY'S kite, torn in a couple of places, flutters on the

steps leading up to the bandstand. The yellow smile face

grins eerily in the darkness. It is streaked with blood.

INT.  OWEN'S PUB

He breaks for the door. ANDY FAIRTON grabs him.

He pushes ANDY aside. HERB is out the door, chased by PETE

and several of the others.

EXT.  THE BANDSTAND  NIGHT

He comes out of the shadows, his drawn gun dangling by his

side. This man has had an extremely bad shock. The legs of

his uniform pants are splashed with blood. He makes it down

two steps and then sits heavily by the remains of BRADY'S

smiling, bloody kite. He looks straight ahead. He looks at

nothing.

He looks at the kite, then looks away. He puts a hand over

his face and starts to cry.

EXT.  THE COMMON, LOOKING BACK TOWARD MAIN STREET  NIGHT

A number of men - not all that were in Owen's but quite a

few of them - are running toward the bandstand. HERB KINCAID

is in the lead, screaming his son's name over and over.

SOUND: A LONG HOWL, now at some distance.

EXT.  THE BANDSTAND, WITH HALLER AND KINCAID

As HERB KINCAID approaches.

Disappears into the dark. HALLER looks down at his lap.

The other men arrive, PETE in the lead. HALLER doesn't look

up.

The men look uneasily at HALLER, at each other. ANDY FAIRTON

shoves forward.

SOUND: HERB SCREAMS. A pause. HERB screams again. The men

flinch back. HALLER doesn't look up. Now, from the darkness

on the bandstand, HERB begins to LAUGH. The men shrink back

further, looking more uneasy than ever.

Now HALLER gets up and joins the other men.

EXT.  THE BANDSTAND, MEN'S POV  NIGHT

HERB KINCAID appears. He is laughing. He is smeared with his

son's blood. In each hand he holds one of his son's shoes.

HERB laughs harder.

HERB SCREAMS LAUGHTER. THE CAMERA DOLLIES IN TO CLOSE ON

BRADY'S KITE.

EXT.  THE MOON, CU

SOUND: HERB SCREAMING.

EXT.  HOLY FAMILY CHURCH  DAY

SOUND: An organ is playing that sweet old hymn, "Bringing In

The Sheaves."

There are lots of cars parked in front of the church, but

there's a space left just big enough for UNCLE AL'S MG.

MARTY'S Silver Bullet is strapped to the back.

INT.  HOLY FAMILY CHURCH  DAY

MARTY'S chair is at the back of the church. Most of the

mourners are crying. MRS. BOWIE is playing the organ.

BRADY'S coffin is on a bier at the front - closed of course.

There are lots of flowers.

INT.  UNCLE AL, MARTY, TAMMY, AND MRS. STURMFULLER IN A PEW

As we look at them, from left to right: UNCLE AL, MARTY,

TAMMY, MRS. STURMFULLER.

UNCLE AL unobtrusively takes a small silver flask from his

hip pocket. Engraved on it in Old English letters is the

word "rotgut." He spins the cap and takes a quick knock. He

pauses and glances at MARTY, who looks deeply stunned.

UNCLE AL hands the flask to MARTY. MARTY looks at him

questioningly for a moment, and then drinks. MARTY looks at

TAMMY, who looks frankly terrible. Her mother is looking

away. MARTY nudges her. She looks around at him. He offers

her the flask. Her eyes widen.

After a brief moment's consideration, TAMMY takes the flask

and has a deep swallow. She hands the flask back to MARTY,

who hands it quickly back to UNCLE AL as TAMMY coughs. Her

mother looks at her... then at MARTY and UNCLE AL. UNCLE AL

smiles sympathetically, hiding the flask with one hand, as

if to say, "Isn't it a terrible thing?" MRS. STURMFULLER

looks distractedly back toward the service.

UNCLE AL pockets the flask just as the organ stops playing.

INT.  THE PODIUM, WITH FATHER LOWE

He looks out at them.

INT.  THE CONGREGATION

They look back at LOWE, hoping for some help in

understanding this awful thing.

INT.  LOWE, ABOVE THE COFFIN

He is struggling with this, trying dreadfully hard.

INT.  THE CONGREGATION, WITH MARTY AND TAMMY

The kids are crying. MARTY puts an arm around TAMMY and she

puts her head on his shoulder.

INT.  FATHER LOWE

EXT.  THE MOURNERS, WITH MARTY

MARTY and TAMMY look at each other miserably. TAMMY begins

to cry- for her father as much as for BRADY, one would

think- and she and MARTY embrace.

EXT.  UNCLE AL, CU

He looks at the kids with deep sympathy and deep love.

EXT.  A COUNTRY ROAD  AFTERNOON

UNCLE AL'S sports car passes THE CAMERA. He's taking MARTY

home.

INT.  THE CAR, WITH MARTY AND UNCLE AL

EXT.  UNCLE AL'S CAR, ON MAIN STREET

It cruises past Owen's Pub. There are cars parked out front,

but there are also lots of pickup trucks.

INT.  THE CAR, WITH MARTY AND UNCLE AL

EXT.  THE COSLAW HOUSE  LATE AFTERNOON

UNCLE AL'S car turns in and parks.

INT.  THE CAR, WITH MARTY AND UNCLE AL

UNCLE AL looks at him doubtfully for a moment, as if almost

believing. Then he shakes his head.

He opens his door and gets out.

INT.  MARTY, CLOSER

He would like to believe UNCLE AL... but he doesn't.

INT.  OWEN'S PUB  LATE AFTERNOON

The men are all dressed in hunting clothes-

red-and-black-checked shirts, orange caps, etc. They all

have guns. Among their number are a few women as well,

looking tough and determined. We see almost everyone we've

met up to this point. LOWE is there, looking deeply

troubled.

ANDY FAIRTON is standing on the bar. These are his

vigilantes; he has organized them. ANDY radiates male macho

football-coach confidence. He's mesmerized the crowd: they

really believe they are going to go out and Shoot One for

the Gipper.

The door at the back opens; HALLER and PETE come in. JOE

HALLER is in extremely bad shape. He hasn't come back much

from the murder of BRADY. I believe he is having some sort

of spiritual crisis, and while it is not our purpose to

explore what it might be- this is, after all, a horror movie

and not a John Cassavetes film- we can see that it has

seriously weakened his authority.

Some nervous laughter greets this. Meanwhile, HALLER and

PETE are working their way to the front, where they end up

next to a grim-faced HERB KINCAID.

INT.  THE VIGILANTES, WITH ELMER AND PORTER

INT.  ANDY FAIRTON

INT.  THE CROWD, FEATURING HALLER

A disgruntled murmur meets this. HALLER moves forward a bit,

and turns to face them.

INT.  ANDY FAIRTON

There is a mutter of agreement.

INT.  A SLIGHTLY WIDER SHOT, FEATURING ANDY AND HALLER

ANDY hops off the bar to face HALLER directly. In the b.g.

we see HERB KINCAID (KINCAID, by the way, should be wearing

a black armband- he's come directly from his son's funeral).

HALLER looks at him for a moment, then turns to look at the

crowd. They look rather like a lynch mob; on their faces we

see an uneasy mix of shame and eager determination. HALLER

speaks with a kind of haggard, fading desperation.

They shuffle their feet uneasily; many look down. He is

getting to them.

It's not working. Many of the men look disgusted with both

ANDY and themselves.

HERB KINCAID steps forward.

ANDY, surprised and bewildered, does. HERB turns and looks

grimly at JOE HALLER, who can barely meet his gaze.

Utter silence in OWEN'S place now. The others are staring,

rapt.

HERB turns to the others in the pub. Tears stream down his

face.

HALLER makes no reply. He looks down at his feet.

ANDY FAIRTON has swelled up again. He grins poisonously at

the slumped HALLER. He pushes off after HERB KINCAID. Other

men start to follow.

EXT.  OWEN'S PUB

Men are streaming out, getting into station wagons and

pickup trucks. Engines roar into life. They begin backing

out even as more men come out of the pub. We even hear some

high-spirited yells; they are on their way and their blood

is up.

INT.  OWEN'S PUB

LESTER LOWE, looking more distressed than ever, pushes his

way through the men toward the door, and THE CAMERA FOLLOWS.

He grabs BILLY McCLAREN.

He pushes outside. LOWE looks around wildly; his face says

he can't believe this is happening. He grabs PORTER

ZINNEMAN, then, as PORTER shoves by him, at a couple of

others with mounting desperation.

HALLER makes his way to LOWE through the thinning crowd and

draws him aside.

HALLER laughs.

OWEN KNOPFLER hurries past them; he has a rifle over one

shoulder in a sling. In his left hand he carries the

peacemaker bat.

EXT.  OUTSIDE OWEN'S

More cars and trucks pull away. There's a big old Ford

"woody" wagon still there, with ANDY FAIRTON standing

impatiently by the driver's side door. BILLY McCLAREN and

BOBBY ROBERTSON are with him, and a big, solid-looking woman

named MAGGIE ANDREWS.

OWEN comes out and crosses to the woody.

They pile into the car, ANDY behind the wheel. He throws it

into gear and backs out onto Main Street.

EXT.  MAIN STREET, A NEW ANGLE

We see a parade of cars and pickup trucks headed out of

town.

EXT.  FATHER LESTER LOWE

He's standing on the curb and watching them leave town in

procession, some honking their horns, others yelling

cheerfully. The expression on his face is dark and brooding.

EXT.  THE FULL MOON, CU  NIGHT

EXT.  ELMER AND PORTER ZINNEMAN  NIGHT

ELMER is lying on his belly, stuck halfway under a

barbed-wire fence. The seat of his pants is badly snagged.

The brothers are on the verge of a wooded area. We can see

ground mist creeping around the bottoms of the trees.

PORTER grabs ELMER'S right arm and pulls. There's a RIPPING

SOUND. ELMER screams.

PORTER begins to pick the barbed wire out of ELMER'S pants.

EXT.  IN THE WOODS, WITH REV. O'BANION AND VIRGIL CUTTS

NIGHT

O'BANION looks rather amusing in his hunting gear- like that

priest from "The Exorcist" on safari.

SOUND: A HOWL, FAIRLY LOUD

They move slowly ahead, O'BANION still a bit in the lead.

THE CAMERA FOLLOWS as the reverend pushes into some

knee-high brush.

SOUND: A RUSTY METALLIC CLANG, followed by a FLESHY CHOMP.

O'BANION begins to scream and struggle.

VIRGIL lunges to him and looks down.

EXT.  O'BANION'S FOOT, VIRGIL'S POV

A medium-sized trap- something in which one might reasonably

catch a wild cat or a coydog, let us say- has its rusty

teeth sunk deeply into the reverend's ankle.

EXT.  O'BANION AND VIRGIL

He kneels down.

EXT.  VIRGIL

He muscles the trap open, a little at a time.

EXT.  O'BANION

Relaxing.

SOUND: THE WOLF HOWLING CLOSE.

EXT.  VIRGIL

Startled and unnerved by the HOWL, the trap slips out of his

hands and snaps shut on O'BANION'S mangled ankle again.

EXT.  REVEREND O'BANION

He screams.

EXT.  THE MOON, CU

It slides behind a cloud.

SOUND: THE WOLF HOWLING.

EXT.  ANDY FAIRTON'S GROUP

ANDY, BILLY McCLAREN, BOBBY ROBERTSON, OWEN KNOPFLER, and

MAGGIE ANDREWS have been joined by two other men- MR.

ASPINALL and EDGAR ROUNDS.

They have drawn close together, listening as the HOWL FADES.

We can tell by their uneasy faces that some of the joy has

gone out of the evening.

They are standing on one side of a ravine. The bottom is

filled with a still ground mist. A few bushes poke out of

it. There are woods on the far side.

ANDY FAIRTON and EDGAR ROUNDS laugh. ASPINALL and BILLY

McCLAREN smile a little.

EXT.  ANDY'S GROUP, FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE RAVINE

Reading from right to left: OWEN KNOPFLER (his gun is still

over his shoulder; it is the peacemaker baseball bat he is

holding), BOBBY ROBERTSON, ASPINALL, ANDY FAIRTON, BILLY

McCLAREN, EDGAR ROUNDS and MAGGIE ANDREWS.

They come slowly down toward THE CAMERA, alert and ready for

anything- at least, they think so.

EXT.  ANDY'S GROUP, ANGLE SHOT

They reach the bottom of the ravine and begin to make their

way across it. The mist is waist to chest deep. They push

toward the other side. Now they are about halfway.

SOUND: A STEADY, LOW GROWLING, CLOSE.

They all stop, scared.

ASPINALL is looking around, his eyes widening with fear.

The GROWLING STOPS. There's a beat of silence. Then:

SOUND: SNARLING...AND A RIPPING CHOMP as dinner is served.

SOUND: A SCREAM.

EXT.  EDGAR ROUNDS, CLOSE

He's the one screaming, and if he reminds us of O'BANION,

that's okay, because ROUNDS has also been caught in a trap.

He tries to run, stumbles, falls into the ground fog. He

goes on screaming. We can see his back for a moment, and

then it disappears.

SOUNDS OF CRUNCHING AND SCREAMING.

ROUNDS SHRIEKS. His hand and arm come up like the hand of a

drowning man. Then it's gone. ROUNDS is gone.

EXT.  THE SKIRMISH LINE

They stand there, chest deep in mist, a conspicuous hole in

the ranks where EDGAR was.

EXT.  BOBBY ROBERTSON, CU

EXT.  THE SKIRMISH LINE IN THE RAVINE, A NEW ANGLE

The GROWLING STARTS AGAIN. THE CAMERA PANS SLOWLY UP THE

LINE. The mist swirls, hiding whatever's beneath.

EXT.  ASPINALL, CU

The LOW GROWL rises to a snarl. And from below the mist,

snarling and bestial but understandable, mocking ASPINALL'S

voice:

SOUND: CHOMP!

ASPINALL SHRIEKS and tries to run. He falls into the mist.

There is another CHOMP. When he flounders up, half his face

is gone.

A hairy arm rises from the mist and yanks ASPINALL down.

EXT.  ANDY'S GROUP

They panic and break for it- MAGGIE, BILLY, and ANDY for one

side, BOBBY and OWEN for the other.

EXT.  OWEN, WEREWOLF'S POV

THE CAMERA IS RUSHING THROUGH THE GROUND MIST- this is like

being in an airplane that's skimming the top of a cloud.

EXT.  OWEN KNOPFLER

He's hit, as an unlucky swimmer might be hit by a shark. He

whirls around, raising the peacemaker bat.

EXT.  THE GROUND MIST, OWEN'S POV

For a moment there's nothing- and then the werewolf rises

out of it, eyes glaring green, muzzle and pelt slimed with

gore.

EXT.  MAGGIE AND ANDY

He runs, while MAGGIE stares, mesmerized, at:

EXT.  OWEN AND THE WEREWOLF

The WEREWOLF closes in on OWEN, who belts it a good one with

the peacemaker. The WEREWOLF swipes at him. OWEN ducks and

slams it again. The WEREWOLF roars with anger.

The WEREWOLF dives under the ground mist.

Uncertain, OWEN begins to back up, holding the bat in his

hands. OWEN is jerked down into the mist. He SCREAMS. The

peacemaker rises out of the ground mist and comes down.

Bonk! The WEREWOLF roars in pain. CHOMPING SOUND. OWEN

shrieks.

The peacemaker rises out of the mist again. The hands

holding it are bloody. Blood runs down the bat. It descends.

Bonk! The WEREWOLF roars again. There is a GURGLING SCREAM

from OWEN... and then a curious SPLINTERING SOUND as the

WEREWOLF sinks its fangs into the bat.

EXT.  THE RAVINE

THE CAMERA MOVES ABOVE as the WEREWOLF moves below, escaping

down the draw.

Pause. SOUND, IN THE B.G.- low but slowly getting louder: a

congregation singing "Bringing In the Sheaves" to the

accompaniment of a pipe organ.

THE WEREWOLF FADES OUT; human voices singing the same hymn

overwhelm it and we

INT.  HOLY FAMILY CATHOLIC CHURCH, PULPIT POV  MORNING

It's an almost exact reprise of #167. Most of the mourners

are crying; MRS. BOWIE playing the organ; MARTY'S chair

parked at the back. We can see UNCLE AL, MARTY, TAMMY, and

MRS. STURMFULLER, exactly as they were at BRADY KINCAID'S

funeral; in fact, this seems to be an instant reply of that

event. One difference: we can't see BRADY'S coffin. It's

below us. The hymn ends.

INT.  FATHER LOWE, IN THE PULPIT

INT.  THE CONGREGATION, FEATURING HERB KINCAID

He sits in the first pew. In his grief he looks dead.

INT.  LOWE, AT THE PULPIT

He's thrown off his stride. Beginning to sweat. He's like an

actor trying to remember his lines.

He looks down. His eyes widen in fear.

INT.  THE COFFINS, LOWE'S POV

Yes, that's coffins- plural. Where BRADY'S coffin was

formerly, there are now six coffins, smothered with flowers.

INT.  LOWE, IN THE PULPIT

He is badly scared now; sweat is dripping off him.

LOWE looks toward:

INT.  FIRST ROW PEW, WITH HERB KINCAID, LOWE'S POV

He's looking down at something in his hands. Now he looks up

and we see his face has become bestial. His eyes are green.

As we look at him, the transformation cotinues. He's turning

into a werewolf.

And sure enough, HERB KINCAID holds BRADY'S dripping heart

up in what were hands but which are now rapidly becoming

paws.

INT.  LESTER LOWE, AT THE PULPIT

He staggers back, in terror.

INT.  THE CONGREGATION, LOWE'S POV

MRS. BOWIE begins bringing in a few more sheaves on the

church organ, and the congregation begins to sing.

We pan their faces, stopping on JOE HALLER. Now something is

happening to JOE'S face. It is bulging, changing. He looks

up from his hymnal and his eyes glare green. The pupils are

split. He grins, showing big teeth.

They are all changing. Among the things we see are:

PETE SYLVESTER, who is a church deacon, rushing down the

aisle, changing, snarling. He grabs ANDY FAIRTON and the two

of them grapple in the aisle.

A YOUNG WOMAN with a baby in her arms turns back the blanket

covering the baby's face and we see it's a wolfling; already

the YOUNG WOMAN'S own hands are turning into claws.

TAMMY STURMFULLER changing; PELTZER the druggist changing;

the ZINNEMAN BROTHERS changing.

At the organ, MRS. BOWIE is now a werewolf clad in tatters

of a silk bombazine dress; she/it is still wearing a veiled

hat on her head, and she is beating the shit out of the

organ keys with her clawed hands. She sounds like Jerry Lee

Lewis after swallowing about a dozen bennies. And now the

tune changes from the remnants of "Bringing In The Sheaves."

It changes into the Rheingold jingle.

INT.  LOWE

FATHER LOWE goes stumbling backward, dropping his hymnal.

The man is in an extremity of terror.

INT.  THE CONGREGATION, LOWE'S POV

Some are tearing their hymnals apart and throwing them at

each other. One guy- BILLY McCLAREN, maybe- wings one of

them through a stained-glass window. Some of the werewolves-

for they are all werewolves now- fight or make love in the

aisles. The rest sway back and forth, grinning ferociously,

singing.

INT.  LOWE

He looks toward:

INT.  THE MRS. BOWIE WEREWOLF, AT THE ORGAN

She grins ferociously up at him, playing the Rheingold

jingle on the pipe organ with her claws. Now blood begins to

bubble up between the keys.

INT.  THE ENTIRE CONGREGATION

The church is a wild shambles of lurching, fighting, singing

werewolves. It's like a New Year's Eve party in hell.

Suddenly a clawed hand burts up through one of the coffins.

And ANDY FAIRTON, who now looks as wolflike as any of them,

bites the hand's claw off.

INT.  REV. LOWE, ON THE PODIUM

He's seen all he can stand. He whirls for the back, where

there is a small door. He pulls it open... and a BRADY

KINCAID werewolf, half torn apart but still somehow alive (a

zombie werewolf, if you can dig it- George Romero would like

it, I think) leaps out and seizes LOWE.

BRADY buries his muzzle in LOWE'S NECK.

INT.  LESTER LOWE, ECU

He sits up into THE CAMERA and SCREAMS. Sweat is running

down his face. He stares at us for a moment, his eyes buggy

and crazed... and then he closes them. There is an

expression of huge relief on his face as he does so.

EXT.  MAIN STREET  DAY

An old sedan cruises slowly down the street. ANNE and TAMMY

STURMFULLER are in the front seat. It's piled high with

possessions and is towing a jackleg trailer with more stuff

in it.

EXT.  HALLER AND PETE

EXT.  THE STURMFULLER CAR, THE COPS' POV  DAY

They are headed out of town all right, but the thing which

perhaps strikes us the most forcibly is how empty this place

is now. Main Street looks like a ghost town.

EXT. JOE HALLER AND PETE SYLVESTER, ON THE SIDEWALK

He nods toward:

EXT.  OWEN'S PUB, LONG (PETE AND HALLER'S POV)

A CLOSED sign hangs in the door; above it is a big black

wreath.

EXT.  HALLER AND PETE

PETE, distressed, does not respond.

PETE'S looking at him in a kind of terror.

He walks away, back toward the Municipal Building (the sign

out front reminds folks to SUPPORT THE MEDCU VAN!) while

PETE looks after him, very deeply troubled.

EXT.  A FAIRGROUND  DAY

It's deserted. Rides stand still. The midway is deserted.

THE CAMERA PANS slowly to a sign which reads TARKER'S MILLS

FAIRGROUNDS GALA FAIR OCTOBER 1 FIREWORKS AT DUSK 10c ON

EVERY DOLLAR GOES TO THE MEDCU VAN FUND!

A cheerful enough sign, except for the strip of paper glued

diagonally across it: FIREWORKS CANCELED.

INT.  THE COSLAW FAMILY STATION WAGON  DAY

It's parked across the road from the sign.

They are distributed just as they were when they arrived at

this same fairgrounds earlier. All of them have ice cream

cones; they are coming home from a family outing.

They've just paused for a quick look at the sign; now BOB

pulls out onto the road again and heads toward home.

INT.  MARTY AND JANE IN THE BACKSEAT

JANE sticks her tongue out at him. MARTY looks away.

EXT.  ANGLE ON THE COSLAW GARAGE  DAY

UNCLE AL'S sports car is parked in the driveway. We hear the

CLANG of a wrench on the cement inside.

INT.  THE GARAGE  DAY

UNCLE AL and MARTY are working on the engine of the Silver

Bullet. UNCLE AL has a six-pack of beer that he's working

through. He and MARTY sit on the floor. As they talk, UNCLE

AL unscrews the last bolt holding the Bullet's carburetor

and pulls it off.

MARTY hands him a medium-sized carton with the words "Speed

Shop" printed on it.

He gives MARTY a kiss and smiles at him. MARTY smiles back.

He pulls out a brand-new carburetor- it's a chrome-plated

four-barrel.

He looks around quickly, guiltily.

MARTY does. UNCLE AL slides the carb onto the gasket and

starts attaching bolts.

EXT.  UNCLE AL, AT THE SIDE OF THE COSLAW HOUSE  DAY

He peeks into the backyard.

EXT.  THE BACK YARD, UNCLE AL'S POV

BOB and NAN are fussing over the barbecue. JANE is hitting a

badminton birdie.

EXT.  THE ROAD IN FRONT OF COSLAWS', WITH MARTY

MARTY is sitting in the Silver Bullet.

UNCLE AL comes hurrying back from his look-see.

MARTY pushes the starter. The engine starts at once, but the

tone is entirely different. Before, MARTY'S wheelchair was a

poppety-popping pussycat. Now the engine rumbles like a

hood's street rod idling at a traffic light.

MARTY looks startled.

MARTY guns it. The engine roars.

MARTY puts the Bullet in gear and pulls away.

EXT.  MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET

CAMERA TRACKS HIM up the road. He goes slowly at first, but

he lets it out a little after a while. He's really moving

along- thirty, maybe forty miles an hour. The wind blows the

hair off his forehead. He begins to grin. He's enjoying

this.

EXT.  UNCLE AL, WATCHING

He drinks some beer. He's grinning, happy for MARTY.

EXT.  MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET

He slows down, turns, stops. He revs the engine. VROOM!

VRROOM!

EXT.  THE SILVER BULLET'S MOTOR, CU

A lot of changes back here. It looks almost like a motorcyle

engine now. That chromed-silver carb predominates.

SOUND: VAROOOOOOOM!

EXT.  MARTY, CU

Grinning. Looking at:

EXT.  THE COSLAW HOUSE, MARTY'S POV

It's about a quarter of a mile away.

EXT. MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET

He winds the engine up and pops the clutch. The Silver

Bullet doesn't so much accelerate as blast off. It tilts

back on its wheels. MARTY swivels into a position like that

of an astronaut on lift-off. The Silver Bullet looks like a

motorcycle popping a wheelie. MARTY has a great big grin on

his face.

EXT.  THE SILVER BULLET, MEDIUM-LONG

Roaring down the highway at fifty or better, blue smoke

jetting from the exhaust. MARTY is plastered back in the

seat with the footrest pointing up at an angle. He's

laughing like a lunatic.

EXT.  UNCLE AL, PEEKING THROUGH HIS FINGERS

EXT.  MARTY IN THE BULLET

He uses the hand brakes. SOUND of braking and squealing

rubber.

EXT.  MARTY AND UNCLE AL

The Silver Bullet comes to a screeching, sluing stop near

UNCLE AL. Blue smoke drifts up from the wheels. MARTY guns

the engine once and then lets it idle.

EXT.  THE NIGHT SKY, WITH THE MOON

The last bit of daylight is just filtering away.

EXT.  THE COSLAW BACKYARD

The barbecue is over. BOB and JANE are putting lawn chairs

on the back porch. MARTY, NAN, and UNCLE AL are all in the

f.g.

He kisses her cheek affectionately, and she smiles at him.

He and UNCLE AL go around to the driveway. NAN looks at them

with troubled love.

EXT.  THE COSLAW DRIVEWAY, WITH MARTY AND UNCLE AL

AL unlocks the trunk of his car and brings out a paper

shopping bag. He places the bag in MARTY'S lap. MARTY opens

the bag, but it's really too dark to see inside. He reaches

in and brings out a handful of assorted fireworks- crackers,

Roman candles, twizzers, smoke bombs, etc.

An expression of sublime delight fills MARTY'S face as he

inventories these goodies.

He brings out a short rocket with stubby vanes on the end. A

fat fuse sticks out behind the head.

MARTY motors over to the side of the garage, where there's a

line of bushes, and conceals the bag in them. UNCLE AL gets

in his car and starts it up. MARTY comes back.

He leaves. MARTY sits in his wheelchair, waving.

EXT.  THE REAR OF THE COSLAW HOUSE  NIGHT

There's a downspout outside one of the upstairs windows. Now

the window goes up and MARTY leans out. He grasps the

downspout and begins working his way down. This should not

be too hard for us to believe; we've already seen how strong

MARTY'S arms are.

His legs dangle limply, but he's doing just fine. When he

reaches the bottom of the drainpipe, they simply crumple

under him and he uses his arms to pull himself over to the

back porch.

MARTY hoists himself over the porch rail. Here, under a

tarp, is the Silver Bullet. MARTY pushes the tarp aside and

gets in. He uses his hands on the wheels to get over the

porch ramp and rolls silently down it. At the bottom he

looks up at:

EXT.  AN UPSTAIRS WINDOW, MARTY'S POV  NIGHT

Still a light on up there.

EXT.  MARTY, IN THE BULLET

Thinks a bit, then starts to hand-roll the Bullet toward:

EXT.  THE PATH BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND THE GARAGE

MARTY comes slowly up the path. We hear soft grunts of

exertion; he's still hand-turning the wheels for the sake of

silence, and it's hard work. He stops at the line of bushes

and gets the bag of fireworks. He puts it on his lap and

starts moving again.

EXT.  THE COSLAW DRIVEWAY, FROM THE ROAD

The driveway has a slight downslant, and MARTY coasts easily

out to the road. He turns right and begins to roll slowly

along the verge of the highway, still using his hands. We

can see that the light is still on upstairs. MARTY turns

back once to verify this himself, then keeps on going. He's

not going to be deprived of his treat.

EXT.  MARTY

He decides he's far enough away to be safe. He pushes the

starter button. The engine cranks, coughs, and cranks some

more. MARTY frowns, and pulls out a wire- a rudimentary

choke, I suppose. He pushes the starter button again. It

cranks, but doesn't start.

MARTY pushes in the wire, looking concerned now, and tries

again. This time, after the engine has cranked over a few

times, it starts.

He puts it in gear and starts off.

EXT.  THE ROAD, WITH MARTY, EXTREMELY LONG

What we see is a tiny boy in a tiny wheelchair moving along

a dark, empty ribbon of road under a vast dome of stars.

DISTANT SOUND: The Bullet's engine.

EXT.  A ROADSIDE TURNOUT  NIGHT

SOUND: Fast-rushing water.

The turnout is packed dirt. There's a grove of trees with

picnic tables spotted among them at the back. The sign in

the extreme f.g. reads ROADSIDE REST AREA at the top; AUGER

FALLS in the middle; TOWNSHIP OF TARKER'S MILLS at the

bottom.

SOUND: The Silver Bullet approaching.

MARTY turns in and rolls to the back of the rest area. He

stops by one of the picnic tables and dumps the bag of

fireworks out onto the picnic table and takes his time

selecting the first- he's like a wine fancier with a whole

cellar of rare bottles to choose from. At last he chooses a

twizzer. He takes matches from the pocket of his pajama top

and lights the fuse.

When it starts to fizz, MARTY tosses it high into the air.

EXT.  THE TWIZZER

It flies in an arc over the drop.

EXT.  THE TWIZZER, FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE CUT

THE CAMERA TRACKS ITS FALL onto some rocks at the edge of

the waterfall's catch pool.

SOUND: Growling.

EXT.  THE CREEK, WITH THE WEREWOLF

It has been drinking from the creek. It looks more than half

human now- we would be able to recognize it for sure, but

its face is in shadow.

It turns from the creek and gets up on its hind legs.

EXT.  THE TWIZZER, ON THE ROCKS

It's guttering out. A hand-paw touches it and draws back

quickly.

SOUND: Hurt, angry growl.

EXT.  MARTY, IN THE REST AREA

He's getting ready to light one of the fountains. He pauses

and looks toward the cut. He's heard something- but the

waterfall muffles it. He lights the fountain's fuse, sets it

on the ground, and rolls the Bullet back a few feet.

The fountain bursts into a shower of light.

EXT.  THE SLOPE OF THE CUT, MEDIUM LONG

The waterfall is in the b.g.

The WEREWOLF is climbing the rocky slope.

EXT.  THE FOUNTAIN, CU

It goes out.

EXT.  MARTY

He rolls over to the picnic table and gets a Roman candle.

He plants the stick in the ground and lights the fuse. The

Roman candle shoots into the sky.

EXT.  THE ROMAN CANDLE

Bursts into colored light.

EXT.  THE WEREWOLF, NEAR THE TOP OF THE CUT, MEDIUM LONG

It GROWLS... and shakes its fists at the fading light in the

sky.

EXT.  MARTY

He's holding another fountain in one hand and his matches in

the other. He's looking toward the cut and the waterfall.

EXT.  THE WEREWOLF, NEAR THE TOP OF THE CUT

It freezes, GROWLING FAINTLY.

EXT.  MARTY

With a little shrug, he lights the fuse on the fountain and

sets it on the ground, as before.

EXT.  THE BACK OF THE GROVE, AT THE TOP OF THE CUT

Claw-hands settle over the top.

EXT.  THE FOUNTAIN, CU

It throws off fiery swirls of sparks, then begins to die

down.

EXT.  MARTY

He's checking out the stuff on the table for his next choice

when he hears a clear SOUND: A SNAPPING, SPLINTERING BRANCH.

EXT.  THE GROVE, WITH THE WEREWOLF

It's run into a low-hanging branch. Instead of pushing it

aside or ducking under it, it simply rips it off the tree.

Although the branch is pretty big, the WEREWOLF does this as

easily as a hungry man might rip a drumstick off a

Thanksgiving turkey. It throws the branch aside and

advances, hunched over on two legs.

EXT.  MARTY

EXT.  THE GROVE AT THE BACK OF THE REST AREA, MARTY'S POV

The grove is a darkened shadowland.

EXT.  MARTY

He punches the Bullet's starter. The motor cranks and

cranks. No go, though. MARTY pulls out the choke wire,

alternating terrified stares at the grove of trees with

terrified stares at his rudimentary dashboard.

EXT.  THE GROVE, MARTY'S POV

Here it comes, out of the shadows, closing in.

EXT.  MARTY

Working that starter for all it's worth... but the motor

only cranks. Still no start.

EXT.  CLAWED, FURRY FEET

EXT.  MARTY

He gives up on the motor. He looks toward the picnic table

where the fireworks are. He grabs up the tracer. He gets the

matches out of the breast pocket of his p.j.'s and promptly

drops them in his lap. He scrabbles for them.

EXT.  THE WEREWOLF, MARTY'S POV

We can't see its face in the dark, but it's closer... much

closer.

EXT.  MARTY

He tries to hold the tracer and strike a match at the same

time.

He can't; to do that he'd need at least one more hand. He

puts the tube of the tracer between his teeth and tries

again.

EXT.  THE MATCHBOOK AND MARTY'S HANDS

He strikes the match... too hard! It bends, the neck broken.

EXT.  WEREWOLF CLAWS, OPENING AND CLOSING

EXT.  MARTY

He is in an extremity of terror.

EXT.  THE MATCHBOOK AND MARTY'S HANDS, CU

He pulls a fresh match from the book and strikes it. It

lights.

EXT.  THE WEREWOLF

It recoils- we still can't see its face except for a vague

shadow.

(NOTE: I keep emphasizing the shadowed face, because this is

not a full-moon period. I've been going on the assumption

that the guy kind of works his way up to full wolfiness,

toothiness, hairiness, etc., starting with a partial change

at about the second quarter. It's a process like the tide

coming in. Thus, if we saw MARTY'S attacker clearly at this

point, I think we would recognize him.)

EXT.  MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET

He takes the tracer from his mouth and applies the match to

the fuse. It splutters alight.

EXT.  MARTY AND THE WEREWOLF, A WIDER SHOT

The WEREWOLF is less than twenty feet away. The tracer

flares alight and shoots out of MARTY'S hand, leaving a

pink-orange trail of smoke behind it. The missile flies at

the WEREWOLF's head.

EXT.  THE WEREWOLF

The tracer strikes it in the face, and we see a flash of

fire. The WEREWOLF screams and blunders away.

EXT.  MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET

He punches the starter again. The motor cranks.

EXT.  THE MOTOR OF THE SILVER BULLET

The motor coughs and fires; a big blue flame jumps from the

fancy carb... and the engine starts to run.

EXT.  THE WEREWOLF

It's staggering away, ROARING and HOWLING. The tube of the

tracer is sticking out of its face- from its left eye, in

fact- like an Indian's arrow. The WEREWOLF smashes branches

out of its way.

EXT.  MARTY IN THE SILVER BULLET

He wheels the Bullet around and heads for the road, gasping

and weeping with fear.

EXT.  THE WEREWOLF, IN THE GROVE

It's blundering through the trees. It pulls the tube from

its face with an ANIMAL SCREAM and drops it.

EXT.  THE TRACER, CU

It lies smoldering on the ground. The end is slick with

blood.

EXT.  THE ROAD, WITH MARTY

The Bullet is really wheeling. MARTY is panting, out of

breath, still deeply frightened.

EXT.  THE WOODS, WITH THE WEREWOLF

We see it blundering along, holding its face; blood bubbles

through its fingers.

EXT.  COSLAW DRIVEWAY, WITH MARTY

He powers up it, and along the path to the back. Perhaps he

has enough speed to cut the engine and coast.

INT.  MARTY'S BEDROOM

His bed is by the window. His hands appear on the

windowsill, and MARTY pulls himself in. He falls over onto

his bed and lies there, spent and exhausted and trembling.

EXT.  THE COSLAW HOUSE, VERY EARLY MORNING

SOUND: RINGING TELEPHONE (FILTER)

INT.  THE COSLAW LIVING ROOM, WITH MARTY

He's sitting in the "house" wheelchair in the living room,

holding the phone tensely to his ear as the RINGING SOUND

goes on.

A CLICK as the phone is picked up.

INT.  UNCLE AL'S BEDROOM

Not a really spiffy place- the decor is Early American

Alcoholic. There's a mostly unclad lady asleep on one side

of the bed. UNCLE AL is sitting on the other in his

skivvies, phone to his ear. There are a lot of bottles and

heaped ashtrays around, and UNCLE AL has a big old hangover.

He hangs up and falls back into bed.

EXT.  THE BACK PORCH, WITH MARTY

He's sitting on the Silver Bullet, just looking at the yard.

JANE comes out.

MARTY looks at her earnestly.

MARTY has to stop. He's almost crying.

EXT.  MAIN STREET, MEDIUM LONG, WITH JANE

JANE is pushing a supermarket shopping cart with a lot of

beer and soda bottles in it. On the side is a sign reading

MEDCU BOTTLE AND CAN DRIVE- plus an outline drawing of the

Medcu unit.

She turns into a yard and pulls her cart up the walk to the

door. She mounts the steps and rings the bell.

EXT.  THE PORCH, WITH JANE, A CLOSER SHOT

A sheer curtain at one side of the door is pulled aside and

a fearful face- that of MRS. THAYER- looks out. Then we hear

bolts being pulled and locks- at least three of them- being

unlocked. The lady is taking no chances.

Her husband comes up the hall.

EXT.  JANE

What we see mostly are her eyes- bright, inquiring.

INT.  LON THAYER, ECU

What we see mostly are his brown eyes.

EXT.  THE PORCH, WITH JANE AND MRS. THAYER

She starts down the steps and we

EXT.  JANE, ON MAIN STREET  DAY

Amazing how deserted Tarker's Mills looks. JANE is pushing

her cart. Even more bottles in it now.

She is passing the Holy Family rectory. LESTER LOWE is out

front, digging in his flower garden. He is shirtless, back

to JANE and to us; his black shirt with the turned-around

collar hangs informally on a bush.

EXT.  JANE, FARTHER DOWN MAIN STREET

She stops at Robertson's Luncheonette, leaves her cart

outside, and goes in. THE CAMERA FLOATS TO THE WINDOW; we

see JANE explaining about the bottle campaign to BOBBY while

a few men seated at the counter listen.

INT.  JANE, ECU

Wide eyes, mostly.

INT.  BOBBY ROBERTSON, ECU

Mostly eyes.

INT.  ROBERTSON'S, FEATURING JANE

As she turns away, her eyes sweep the men at the counter.

INT.  THE MEN, JANE'S POV

Some of them- PELTZER, VIRGIL CUTTS- are familiar. Others

are not. THE CAMERA PANS THEIR FACES CLOSELY, FEATURING

THEIR EYES.

EXT.  OUTSIDE ROBERTSON'S, WITH JANE

She grabs the handle of the cart again and proceeds down

Main Street. She goes into the barber shop.

INT.  THE BARBER SHOP  DAY

As JANE enters, BILLY McCLAREN is giving one man a trim.

Another man is tipped back with his face wrapped in a towel.

Two or three other townies are waiting on tonsorial

beautification, reading magazines. None, of course, has only

one eye. JANE checks them all out carefully.

But her eyes have fixed on the towel over the face of the

man in the other barber chair. She walks over to him.

INT.  JANE AND THE TOWELED MAN, CLOSER ON

The men laugh. JANE smiles politely. And pulls the hot towel

away from his eyes. His two eyes.

She puts the towel back and THE CAMERA FOLLOWS as she

returns to the door.

JANE goes out.

EXT.  JANE, AT THE RECTORY

She pushes the shopping cart up to the gate, opens it, and

goes up the walk to the foot of LOWE'S porch steps. She

leaves it there and climbs to the porch.

EXT.  JANE, ON THE PORCH

The screen door is shut, the inner wooden door open.

INT.  THE RECTORY HALLWAY, JANE'S POV

Dark and empty. SOUNDS in the kitchen. EATING SOUNDS, maybe-

or maybe we can't tell.

EXT.  JANE, ON THE PORCH

She knocks on the screen door.

INT.  THE KITCHEN

LOWE is standing by the refrigerator door. He's holding a

raw leg of lamb and tearing at it with his teeth. Lamb blood

smears his face and runs down his arms. He is as human as

you or me (in a manner of speaking, as UNCLE AL would say),

but when JANE speaks, his head snaps up and his eye flares-

his one eye. The other is covered by a patch.

EXT.  JANE, ON THE PORCH

EXT.  JANE, A WIDER SHOT

She goes down the steps and starts to push the cart around

the house.

INT.  THE KITCHEN, WITH LOWE

He crosses to the window over the kitchen sink, the bloody

chunk of meat still in his hands, and looks out.

EXT.  JANE, LOWE'S POV

She pushes the cart along a path toward a combination garage

and utility shed at the back.

INT.  THE KITCHEN, WITH LOWE

Still watching JANE, he begins to gnaw ravenously at the

meat again.

EXT.  JANE, AT THE SHED-GARAGE

She opens the door and slowly pushes her cart inside.

INT.  THE UTILITY SHED-GARAGE, WITH JANE

This is a creepy little place, now filled with bottles and

cans that have been crammed in helter-skelter, every which

way. JANE obviously doesn't like it. She begins to unload

her cart rapidly, mumbling numbers to herself.

SOUND: SQUEAKING.

JANE looks down.

INT.  THE UTILITY SHED-GARAGE FLOOR, JANE'S POV

A good-sized mouse comes out from between a pile of stacked

bottles and runs across JANE'S shoe.

INT.  JANE

She utters a litle scream and shrinks back against the wall,

bumping it quite hard. Hard enough to knock something off an

overhead shelf. It falls into the bottles, SHATTERING

several. JANE screams again- not terribly loud- and then

slowly bends toward the object and picks it up.

JANE holds it, both puzzled and scared.

EXT.  THE BACK DOOR OF THE RECTORY

JANE approaches it, holding a piece of paper in her hand-

her tally sheet. She knocks. Waits. There is no answer. She

knocks again. Waits. No answer. She tries the door. It

opens.

No answer. After a moment of interior debate, JANE enters

the kitchen.

INT.  JANE, IN THE RECTORY KITCHEN

She looks around. No one here. But there is a bloody spot on

the counter- LOWE must have set his grisly luncheon down

here for a moment. She walks slowly across the kitchen and

into the dark hall.

Farther into the hall. A hand drops onto her shoulder.

She jumps, and so do we. She turns around and looks up at:

INT.  FATHER LOWE, ECU

Featuring his eyes- his eye, rather. The left is covered

with a black eye-patch.

He holds his hand out, and JANE puts the tally sheet in it

like one in a dream. She can't take her eyes off that black

patch, which tells her everything.

INT.  THE HALLWAY, WITH JANE AND LOWE

JANE is retreating down the hall toward the front door.

INT.  LOWE, CU

How much does he know? How much has he guessed? Hard to tell

from his face, which now seems sinister, with its eye-patch.

INT.  JANE, AT THE PORCH END OF THE HALLWAY

She bolts.

INT.  LOWE, IN THE HALLWAY

CAMERA HOLDS ON HIM, standing silent and enigmatic.

EXT.  THE COSLAW BACKYARD, WITH MARTY

His eyes are wide. He's leaning forward in his wheelchair.

EXT.  JANE AND MARTY

She's changed into shorts and a blouse.

INT.  A SHEET OF RULED SCHOOL NOTEBOOK PAPER, CU

A hand- MARTY'S- comes into the frame and prints: I KNOW WHO

YOU ARE, AND I KNOW WHAT YOU ARE.

INT.  MARTY'S ROOM, WITH MARTY

He's sitting at his desk, a pool of light from the lamp

focused on the sheet of paper before him. He thinks a

moment, then begins to write again.

INT.  THE NOTEBOOK PAD, CU

He is adding: WHY DON'T YOU KILL YOURSELF?

INT.  MARTY, AT HIS DESK

He studies this for a second, and seems satisfied. He opens

a drawer, brings out an envelope, and folds his letter into

it.

EXT.  JANE, ON MAIN STREET

She has the letter in her hand. She approaches the mailbox,

opens the mailbox door, and then glances at the envelope

again.

EXT.  THE ENVELOPE, JANE'S POV

Addressed in pencil, it says: FATHER LESTER LOWE/HOLY FAMILY

RECTORY; 149 MAIN STREET/TARKER'S MILLS, MAINE.

EXT.  JANE, AT THE MAILBOX

She drops the letter in with the air of a girl lighting the

fuse on a packet of high explosives. She turns away toward

home.

INT.  THE RECTORY LIVING ROOM, WITH LESTER LOWE

He's standing at the window and looking out. The torn-open

envelope is on an end table beside him. He's holding the

lined sheet of paper in his hand. An expression of bitter

hate twists his features, and he slowly crumples the paper

in his fist.

EXT.  JANE, AT THE MAIN STREET MAILBOX

She drops in another letter and walks away.

EXT.  THE TARKER'S MILLS COMMON, LONG

Parked at the curb is UNCLE AL'S sports car.

EXT.  UNCLE AL, JANE, AND MARTY, ON THE COMMON

JANE stamps her foot, furious with UNCLE AL.

EXT.  OUTSIDE OF ROBERTSON'S LUNCHEONETTE

The Silver Bullet stands outside. The door opens and UNCLE

AL, JANE, and MARTY come out. UNCLE AL is carrying MARTY

piggyback. MARTY has an ice cream cone. JANE is holding two.

UNCLE AL squats, depositing MARTY in the Bullet. MARTY

starts the engine as JANE hands UNCLE AL his ice cream cone.

The three of them start up the street and THE CAMERA TRACKS

THEM.

UNCLE AL stops. He hasn't thought of this. He looks toward:

EXT.  THE CATHOLIC RECTORY, LONG - UNCLE AL'S POV

LESTER LOWE is mowing the lawn, eye-patch and all.

EXT.  MAIN STREET, WITH UNCLE AL, MARTY, AND JANE

EXT.  THE RECTORY LAWN, WITH LESTER LOWE

Keeps on moving. MR. ASPINALL drives by and waves. LOWE

waves back.

EXT.  MAIN STREET, WITH UNCLE AL, MARTY, AND JANE

UNCLE AL looks momentarily ashamed of himself. Then he

throws his hands up in disgust.

He walks ahead of them. MARTY bats his eyes sweetly at JANE.

She walks on, miffed. MARTY gooses the Silver Bullet to

catch up.

EXT.  A FIELD ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN  DAY

It's midafternoon. A bunch of kids are playing baseball. In

the extreme f.g. we see one small boy- MARTY- sitting back

to us in his wheelchair, watching.

EXT.  AN OLD COUPE

It draws slowly along a tree-lined lane and stops. LESTER

LOWE is behind the wheel.

SOUNDS OF THE BASEBALL GAME CONTINUE.

EXT.  THE BASEBALL FIELD, AND MARTY, LOWE'S POV

THE CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY IN ON MARTY'S BACK.

EXT.  LESTER LOWE

EXT.  A FLY BALL

EXT.  THE FIELD, A WIDER SHOT

The field team heads in. Kids start streaming back toward

town.

EXT.  MARTY

The OUTFIELDER who caught the fly trots past, and glances

his way.

I think that here we are seeing a rare moment of depression

in MARTY- they can run and play ball. He can't.

He fires up the Bullet and starts away alone.

EXT.  LOWE'S COUPE

He starts it up.

EXT.  MARTY, LOWE'S POV

He bumps up a grassy slope to a tarred road. The last of the

other kids are headed back the other way. MARTY is alone.

EXT.  LOWE'S COUPE

It turns out of the lane where it was parked and onto the

road.

EXT.  MARTY'S WHEELCHAIR, LOWE'S POV

MARTY'S back is to us. The wheelchair draws rapidly closer

to THE CAMERA as LOWE bears down on it.

INT.  LOWE, BEHIND THE COUPE'S WHEEL

He leans over the wheel, grinning sadistically.

EXT.  MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET

He's daydreaming his way along- maybe, inside his head, he's

playing center field for the Dodgers.

SOUND: Winding roar of a car engine. MARTY turns around.

EXT.  LOWE'S COUPE, MARTY'S POV, ROARING AT THE CAMERA

EXT.  MARTY AND LOWE'S COUPE

MARTY opens the throttle wide and the Bullet swerves across

the road. The coupe's bumper actually clips it on the way

by, jolting MARTY and almost overturning the Bullet.

LOWE'S coupe veers over the embankment and partway down into

the ditch.

INT.  LOWE, BEHIND THE WHEEL OF THE COUPE

He floors the engine.

EXT.  THE COUPE'S REAR WHEELS

Spinning helplessly in the dirt.

EXT.  MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET

He speeds past the coupe, and thumbs his nose.

INT.  LOWE, IN THE COUPE

He's in a teeth-grinding fury. He jams the gear-shift lever

into reverse and floors the gas pedal again.

EXT.  THE COUPE

It roars backward in a cloud of ditch dust and bounces onto

the road. Then it screams out after the rapidly disappearing

Silver Bullet.

EXT.  THE SILVER BULLET, WITH MARTY

He hears the GROWLING SOUND of LESTER LOWE'S coupe. He looks

behind.

EXT.  THE COUPE

Roars toward THE CAMERA.

EXT.  MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET

He twists the throttle and the Silver Bullet responds.

EXT.  CHASE MONTAGE

The director will shoot it as he likes- the basis is simple:

LOWE is chasing MARTY's hopped-up wheelchair along a country

road at speeds approaching fifty MPH. MARTY should have a

couple of near misses, and perhaps we could actually have

him pass one car. At one point we should have a REVERSE

ANGLE on LESTER LOWE'S coupe, featuring two bumper stickers:

ATTEND AND SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL CHURCH and HONK IF YOU LOVE

JESUS!

As the chase goes on it becomes apparent that LOWE is

gaining. MARTY looks increasingly desperate. And now he

looks down at:

EXT.  THE SILVER BULLET'S GAS GAUGE, MARTY'S POV

The needle is all the way over on "E."

EXT.  MARTY

He groans. SOUND of the coupe's engine GROWS LOUDER.

EXT.  THE COUPE AND THE SILVER BULLET

LOWE charges, rapidly closing the distance. MARTY swerves

from one side of the road to the other, escaping LOWE for

the moment but almost overturning in the process.

They are now running beside a river- the Auger River, in

fact.

EXT.  THE BULLET'S GAS GAUGE

Now the needle is actually past "E."

EXT.  MARTY

His face registers hope as he sees:

EXT.  ROADSIDE SIGN, MARTY'S POV

AUGER RIVER COVERED BRIDGE 2000 FEET AHEAD AUTOMOBILES

PROHIBITED!

EXT.  MARTY, IN THE BULLET

He twists the throttle as far as it will turn- he's going

for broke. The coupe chases him- and now the Silver Bullet's

motor COUGHS.

EXT.  THE BRIDGE, MARTY'S POV

It's pretty ramshackle. A big orange sign beside it reads:

BRIDGE UNSAFE! TRUCKS AND AUTOS ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITED!

EXT.  THE SILVER BULLET

MARTY brakes, hits the shoulder of the road, and somehow

makes the turn. We see him holding on for dear life as the

Silver Bullet bounces and jounces down the dirt road to the

mouth of the covered bridge.

EXT.  LOWE'S COUPE

It overshoots the right turn MARTY just took, screeches to a

halt, backs up, and turns onto the lane.

EXT.  THE SILVER BULLET

It bounces up the incline to the bridge, MOTOR COUGHING AND

SPLUTTERING.

EXT.  THE COUPE

It comes to a sliding, dirt-digging stop.

INT.  LOWE, BEHIND THE WHEEL

His face is so full of frustrated hate that it has become

the face of a gargoyle.

EXT.  THE SIGN PROHIBITING MOTOR TRAFFIC, LOWE'S POV

EXT./INT.  THE COVERED BRIDGE, WITH THE BULLET

It's dim and spooky in here. Cracks between the boards of

the side walls allow dusty fingers of daylight to shine

through. More light rays up from the cracks in the floor.

The floorboards are warped and uneven; MARTY'S wheelchair

sways drunkenly from side to side. The total inside passage

is about seventy feet.

About halfway across, the Silver Bullet coughs its last

cough and splutters its last splutter. It rolls along

silently, going on its dying momentum.

EXT.  THE FAR END OF THE BRIDGE, MARTY'S POV

Drawing closer. We hear the SOUNDS of boards rumbling under

the Silver Bullet's tires and the Auger River beneath.

EXT.  MARTY, REVERSE

Rolling ever more slowly, the Silver Bullet approaches THE

CAMERA... and stops. MARTY is covered with sweat. His hair

is in a wild tangle. He's panting. He looks at:

EXT.  THE LANE LEADING AWAY FROM THE BRIDGE, MARTY'S POV

This is an extremely rustic lane. Pretty, but hardly the

sort of place in which one would want to find oneself when

one has a part-time werewolf and a full-time homicidal

maniac close behind.

EXT.  MARTY, AT THE MOUTH OF THE BRIDGE

MARTY'S head whips around.

EXT.  THE FAR END OF THE BRIDGE, MARTY'S POV

We see a brilliant square of light. In it stands LOWE'S

silhouette. The silhouette begins to move. SOUND of

footfalls on the loose floorboards of the covered bridge.

INT.  LOWE'S SHOES

Sensible black Oxfords.

SOUND of footfalls resumes.

EXT.  MARTY

He's nearly paralyzed with terror- even if he wasn't, he

wouldn't get far in a powerless Silver Bullet.

INT.  LOWE, IN THE SHADOWS

He begins to walk forward again.

EXT.  LOWE, MARTY'S POV

He's halfway across the bridge now, walking slowly, not

hurrying.

SOUND: TRACTOR ENGINE. LOWE stops, alert to possible danger.

EXT.  MARTY

TRACTOR SOUND IS LOUDER.

MARTY'S face fills with hope. He looks from LOWE toward:

EXT.  THE LANE, MARTY'S POV

THE TRACTOR SOUND gets louder still, and here comes ELMER

ZINNEMAN on a John Deere. The tractor is hauling a manure

spreader which is mostly empty.

EXT.  MARTY

INT.  THE COVERED BRIDGE, WITH LOWE

He draws back a little, and his face is sharp with animal

cunning- inside his head he's running a four-minute mile.

Stay and try to bluff it out, or beat it?

EXT.  ELMER AND MARTY

ELMER draws the tractor up close to MARTY and swings it

around. MARTY looks back at:

INT.  THE COVERED BRIDGE, MARTY'S POV

Empty.

SOUND OF A CAR STARTING, FAINT.

EXT.  MARTY AND ELMER

MARTY looks back at ELMER.

He looks back once more toward:

EXT./INT.  THE COVERED BRIDGE, MARTY'S POV

Brooding, shadowy. CAMERA HOLDS AND WE

EXT.  THE COSLAW BACKYARD  DAY

MARTY is talking to UNCLE AL. JANE is behind them, knocking

croquet balls through the wickets on the back lawn.

MARTY is looking at his Uncle anxiously as JANE strolls

over.

What is it?					What other thing?

He makes strangling gestures.

UNCLE AL comes over to JANE'S side of the Silver Bullet. He

looks down at:

EXT.  THE FRAME OF THE BULLET

There's a scrape and a dent where LOWE'S coupe dented it.

There is also a fleck of paint.

EXT.  UNCLE AL AND JANE, CU

EXT.  THE NIGHT SKY, WITH THE MOON

Three-quarters full.

THE CAMERA PANS DOWN to the Tarker's Mills town hall. UNCLE

AL'S sports car is parked out front.

INT.  THE CONSTABLE'S OFFICE, WITH HALLER AND UNCLE AL

HALLER is behind his desk, rocked back in his chair, hands

laced together behind his head. He's looking at UNCLE AL.

There's a silence that draws out for quite some time. In it,

UNCLE AL becomes steadily more uncomfortable.

HALLER rises.

They shake hands.

EXT.  THE RECTORY  NIGHT

A Chevrolet with TARKER'S MILLS CONSTABLE painted on the

side in gold leaf pulls up. JOE HALLER gets out, and as he

does there's a business of pulling his pants legs down over

his boots- nice stitched cowboy boots, not black cop's

shoes. We want the audience to notice these boots, remember

them- probably HALLER should wear them all through the

picture. He goes up the walk.

HALLER rings the doorbell.

No one comes. HALLER rings the bell again. Waits. No one

comes. He leans down and looks through a side window.

INT.  THE RECTORY HALL AND SITTING ROOM, HALLER'S POV

No one there.

EXT.  HALLER

He goes down the steps, stands on the path for a moment, and

then goes over to the shed-garage. He opens the door and

looks in.

EXT./INT.  THE GARAGE, HALLER'S POV

LOWE'S coupe is in there. There's just room for it amid the

shadowy piles of bottles and cans.

INT.  THE GARAGE, WITH HALLER

He goes around to the front of LOWE'S coupe and squats down.

In the b.g.: a heaped mountain of aluminum beer and soda

cans.

HALLER feels in his breast pocket and brings out a Zippo. He

lights it and looks at:

INT.  THE COUPE, CU

One of the turn-signal lamps is broken. There's a scratch in

the paint and a dent in the bumper. HALLER'S fingers come

into the frame and touch the scratch. They stop, and THE

CAMERA ZOOMS IN to a small streak of silvery paint. As MARTY

has a scrape of blue car paint on his wheelchair, so does

LOWE have a scrape of silver wheelchair paint on his car.

INT.  HALLER

His eyes widen.

SOUND: SHATTERING ROAR and the CLINK AND TUMBLE of about

nine thousand cans as LOWE erupts from under the aluminum

scrap heap behind HALLER. He is a mixture of man and

werewolf, and quite clearly a beastial version of LOWE. In

one hand he holds the remains of OWEN KNOPFLER'S peacemaker.

HALLER starts to turn; LOWE strikes him with the bat. CAMERA

CLOSES IN ON LOWE as the bat rises and falls... rises and

falls. We can't see HALLER, and that is probably a mercy,

but we can hear the THUD of the bat as it strikes again and

again and again.

EXT.  THE REST AREA AT AUGER FALLS, WITH MARTY, AL, JANE

DAY

UNCLE AL has taken the Coslaw family station wagon today.

The three of them are sitting in the grove of trees.

MARTY slips off his St. Christopher's medallion and hands it

to UNCLE AL.

UNCLE AL only looks at him, confused and unsure.

EXT.  A COUNTRY ROAD, WITH THE COSLAW STATION WAGON  DAY

UNCLE AL is taking the kids home- THE CAMERA TRACKS the

wagon for a moment, and then we are looking up the short

lane and into a gravel pit.

THE CAMERA ZOOMS IN, FAST, on the sandy rear wall. We can

see one cowboy boot sticking out of a wall of sand. It's

bloody and chewed.

EXT.  THE COSLAW DRIVEWAY  DAY

The wagon pulls in.

INT.  THE CAR, WITH MARTY, JANE, AND UNCLE AL

The St. Cristopher's medal and the crucifix are hanging from

the rearview on a fine silver chain. UNCLE AL takes down the

medal and looks at it.

All right! Thanks!				Thank you, Uncle Al!

EXT./INT.  SILVER BULLET MONTAGE

a.) UNCLE AL pulls up to a city store front with a sign

reading MAC'S GUNS AND AMMO. He takes out the St.

Cristopher's medal, looks at it, and shakes his head, as if

still ruing his own credulity and stupidity. He goes inside.

b.) In the gun shop interior, we see UNCLE AL talking to

MAC, who really should look like an elderly white wizard- a

kind of Gandalf figure. In the b.g. window we see a paper

skeleton and paper jack-o'-lanterns: our first clue that All

Hallow's Eve is nearing. UNCLE AL is speaking animatedly,

using his hands a lot; we don't know exactly what the tale

is, but it must be a whopper. In the course of it, he hands

the medal and the crucifix to MAC, who tents the silver

chains over his fingers and looks at them.

c.) In his workroom, we see MAC spilling boron over the

medal and looking closely at the stain.

d.) In a dim shot which makes MAC look more like a sorcerer

than ever, we see him light an acetylene torch and begin

melting the medal and the crucifix in the crucible. THE

CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY IN as JANE'S contribution and MARTY'S

melt together; they are becoming on and indissoluble.

e.) We see MAC pouring molten silver into a bullet mold.

INT.  MAC'S GUN SHOP, WITH MAC AND UNCLE AL  DAY

MAC comes out of the back with a small inlaid wooden box. He

puts it down on the glass counter top.

INT.  THE BOX, CU

MAC'S hands open it, disclosing a single bullet resting on

dark velvet plush. It is a .22 short round, and it gleams a

pure silver. It would be great to hype this bullet

optically- not much, just a little- to make it look

absolutely magical. Almost holy.

INT.  MAC AND UNCLE AL

UNCLE AL picks up the bullet almost reverently, holds it to

the light.

EXT.  THE FULL MOON, CLOSE  NIGHT

It nearly fills the screen, swimming mysteriously in the

warm summer air.

THE CAMERA PANS DOWN to the COSLAW house. There's a carved

jack in the window and a corsage of Indian corn on the door.

UNCLE AL'S MG is in the driveway. The COSLAW station wagon

is just backing out. UNCLE AL and JANE stand in the doorway;

MARTY is slightly behind them in the Silver Bullet.

NAN leans out of the car. She's wearing black, and she has

obviously been crying.

The station wagon backs farther and NAN leans out again.

The station wagon backs out into the road and NAN pops out

again.

'Bye, mom! Bye, dad!				We will! 'Bye!

The station wagon accelerates away.

He ushers them inside and closes the door.

INT.  THE STATION WAGON, WITH BOB AND NAN

INT.  THE WALL CLOCK IN THE COSLAW LIVING ROOM  NIGHT

It reads 1:00.

SOUND: The National Anthem.

INT.  THE TV, CU

The anthem finishes up. We go to a station ID card.

The TV goes to snow.

INT.  JANE ON THE COUCH

She's mostly asleep in one corner.

INT.  MARTY, IN THE SILVER BULLET

He's also dozing.

INT.  UNCLE AL, IN BOB'S EASY CHAIR IN FRONT OF THE TV

He is also dozing. There are three or four empty beer cans

in front of him, and a cigarette with a long ash is

smoldering between his fingers. There's a .22 pistol in his

lap.

EXT.  THE COSLAW HOUSE, FROM ONE SIDE

The WEREWOLF breaks from the woods and runs across the side

yard to a line of high bushes that runs along the side of

the house (this is the opposite side from MARTY'S bedroom).

EXT.  IN THE BUSHES, WITH THE WEREWOLF

There is a space in here between the house and the bushes-

it's like an animal's run. The WEREWOLF creeps along this,

its one eye flaring.

DIM SOUND OF TV SNOW.

INT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WITH MARTY, JANE, AND UNCLE AL

UNCLE AL jumps up and cries out as the cigarette burns up to

his fingers. The .22 falls onto the rug.

MARTY and JANE also wake up, startled.

EXT.  IN THE BUSHES, WITH THE WEREWOLF

It recoils, eyes gleaming. Foam begins to drip from its

jaws. It creeps slowly along toward a window. TV SNOW SOUNDS

GROW LOUDER.

INT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WITH AL, JANE, MARTY

UNCLE AL is shaking his burned hand; he picks the cigarette

out of his lap and puts it out.

JANE gets up and starts toward the stairs.

MARTY begins to roll the Silver Bullet toward the stairs,

where the stair chair awaits. JANE is waiting for him at the

living-room doorway. MARTY sees the gun on the floor and

stops.

INT.  UNCLE AL

He prickles a bit at the unstated criticism. He bends down

and picks up the pistol. He opens the cylinder. Five

chambers are empty; in one there's a bright silver circle.

INT.  UNCLE AL

He pushes the cylinder plunger, dropping the silver bullet

into his hand.

Behind him, the WEREWOLF'S head appears in the window, its

green eye flaring.

INT.  BY THE LIVING ROOM DOORWAY, WITH MARTY AND JANE

MARTY, looking toward UNCLE AL, sees nothing. JANE is

looking toward the window and she SCREAMS.

She's pointing at the window.

INT.  UNCLE AL

He jumps up and looks around at the window- at this point AL

has the .22 with its cylinder open in one hand and the

silver bullet loosely held in the other.

Nothing in the window but darkness. UNCLE AL turns back to

the kids.

INT.  MARTY

INT.  UNCLE AL

His shoulders slump a little with relief- now that the scare

is over, his relief is tempered with irritation. They're

just a couple of hysterical kids after all, and JANE is

actually worse than MARTY. Polly Practical indeed!

INT.  MARTY AND JANE, BY THE DOORWAY

JANE is crying.

INT.  UNCLE AL

INT.  MARTY AND JANE, BY THE DOORWAY

MARTY rolls a little closer to her and attempts to put a

comforting arm around her shoulder.

INT.  UNCLE AL

EXT.  THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE, ECU

We see a clawed, hairy hand reach into the frame and close

around a thick wire.

It yanks.

INT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WIDE

The lights go out.

JANE SHRIEKS.

INT.  UNCLE AL

He's starting toward her. At that moment most of the wall-

not just the window it was looking through before but the

whole wall- crashes inward as the WEREWOLF bulls its way

through, roaring.

UNCLE AL whirls, raising the pistol automatically to fire-

but the cylinder is rolled out and all the chambers are

empty. He has time to register surprise before the WEREWOLF

smashes him aside.

INT.  UNCLE AL, A NEW ANGLE

He goes flying backward. The pistol goes one way, the silver

bullet another.

INT.  THE GUN

It spins into a living-room corner.

INT.  THE SILVER BULLET, SLOW MOTION

We see it rise in the air, turning over and over. It comes

down, hits the floor, and rolls.

INT.  THE HALLWAY FLOOR, WITH THE BULLET, SLOW MOTION

In the extreme f.g. is a heating vent. The bullet is rolling

toward it.

INT.  MARTY AND JANE

He uses his hands to propel the ungainly Silver Bullet into

the hall.

INT.  THE BULLET (THE REAL BULLET) AND MARTY, SLOW MOTION

The silver bullet rolls slowly toward the heating vent. In

the b.g. we see a frantic MARTY in his wheelchair.

He heaves himself out of it and falls full-length, grabbing.

His fingers touch the bullet, but that's all. It falls in

the heating vent.

INT.  THE WEREWOLF, CU

It's roaring, furious, its one eye flaring.

INT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WIDE

UNCLE AL lies senseless against one wall, the front of his

shirt bloody. JANE runs into the corner and grabs the

pistol.

The WEREWOLF picks up the easy chair and throws it through

the hole it made coming in. It picks up an end table and

hurls it through the TV. Then it sees JANE and starts toward

her.

INT.  JANE, COWERING IN THE CORNER

INT.  THE WEREWOLF, CU

Comes toward her.

INT.  JANE IN THE CORNER

She makes as if to run one way.

INT.  JANE AND THE WEREWOLF

It's only a couple of feet from her now, but again, it is

toying with her- it's making this reeeal slow.

INT.  THE FIREPLACE TOOLS, CU

A bloodstained hand grabs a poker.

INT.  THE WEREWOLF AND JANE

As it tenses down to leap at her, UNCLE AL leaps at it and

strikes it across the back. It turns, ROARING.

UNCLE AL hits it between the legs.

It BELLOWS and grabs the poker. It bends it and tosses it

aside. The glaring, savage expression on its face says that

now it will bend UNCLE AL and toss him aside.

INT.  JANE

She breaks out of the corner and runs across the room toward

the door. Most of the way there she trips and falls.

INT.  THE WEREWOLF, CU

Its head whips around.

INT.  MARTY, IN THE HALL

He's lying full-length. He's got the heater vent's grille

off. One arm is down inside.

INT.  JANE

She tosses it awkwardly.

INT.  THE GUN, SLOW MOTION

It slides down the hall floor to MARTY like some strange,

awkward shuffleboard disc, its cylinder still open.

INT.  THE WEREWOLF

It begins walking slowly across the living room, smashing

things out of its way.

INT.  MARTY, IN THE HALL

The gun slides into his hand. Now he reaches into the

heating duct again...

INT.  IN THE HEATING DUCT, ECU

There's an elbow bend just below MARTY'S twisting, grasping

fingers- the silver bullet lies here. It's less than half an

inch out of reach.

INT.  THE WEREWOLF, CU

INT.  JANE, ON THE FLOOR

She bites one of the WEREWOLF'S hairy ankles as it passes.

INT.  JANE AND THE WEREWOLF

It roars with pain and kicks her aside. Then it looks back

into the hall. It is grinning. I believe it is thinking this

is going to be better than a Thanksgiving dinner you don't

have to pay for.

INT.  MARTY, CU

He's reaching desperately into the duct and staring at the

approaching WEREWOLF.

INT.  IN THE HEATING DUCT, ECU

MARTY'S fingers brush the bullet once... again... seize it.

INT.  MARTY, IN THE HALL

He rolls over on his back and sticks the silver bullet

blindly into one chamber of the cylinder and slams the

cylinder closed.

INT.  THE WEREWOLF, CU

INT.  MARTY

He points the gun and pulls the trigger. There's only a

click. An expression of dismay on his face.

INT.  THE WEREWOLF, CU

INT.  MARTY

He drags himself so he's half propped against the hall wall.

He pulls the trigger again. Click! Dismay becomes fear.

INT.  THE WEREWOLF

It's reached the Silver Bullet. It smashes it aside. The

Bullet hits the wall.

INT.  MARTY

Holding the gun in both hands now, he pulls the trigger a

third time. Click!

The WEREWOLF'S shadow falls over him.

INT.  WEREWOLF, ECU

It bends down, reaching.

INT.  MARTY, ECU

Craning back as if to drive himself into the wall, he pulls

the trigger again.

INT.  THE BARREL OF THE .22 MAXI-CLOSE

The bullet flies from the barrel, gleaming silver.

INT.  THE WEREWOLF

The silver bullet strikes him in his one remaining eye. He

flies backward, hands clapped to his gushing face... and

crashes into MARTY'S Silver Bullet wheelchair. It sits

there, roaring... and then it begins to change.

INT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WITH JANE

She lies there, sobbing.

INT.  UNCLE AL AND JANE

UNCLE AL is bloody and staggering but on his feet. He helps

JANE up.

SOUND: SHATTERING ROAR.

INT.  THE WEREWOLF, ECU

Its hands drop from its face. It is now blind in both eyes;

it is half WEREWOLF and half LOWE.

It BELLOWS again, convulses... and dies.

INT.  MARTY, ON THE FLOOR

INT.  UNCLE AL AND JANE

Here's a creature that is mostly FATHER LOWE collapsed in

the remains of MARTY'S wheelchair; beyond it, MARTY is lying

on the floor. UNCLE AL goes by the corpse. JANE starts by...

and LOWE sits bolt upright for a moment, grasping blindly at

her.

She shrieks and darts aside. LOWE falls back, now really

dead. I think. Until the sequel.

INT.  THE HALL, WITH UNCLE AL, JANE, AND MARTY

UNCLE AL puts a comforting arm around JANE, who is sobbing

again- hell, I'd be sobbing after that last one, myself- and

draws her down beside himself and MARTY.

They smile at each other with love.

He gets up and leaves.

EXT.  TARKER'S MILLS, LONG  NIGHT

Quiet. Sleeping.

INT.  THE HALLWAY, WITH MARTY AND JANE

EXT.  TARKER'S MILLS, LONG

THE CAMERA PANS UP to the full moon.
