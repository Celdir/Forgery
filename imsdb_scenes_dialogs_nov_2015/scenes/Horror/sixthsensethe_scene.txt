INT. BASEMENT - EVENING

A NAKED LIGHTBULB SPARKS TO LIFE.  It dangles from the ceiling of

a basement.

LIGHT, QUICK FOOTSTEPS AS ANNA CROWE moves down the stairs.

Anna is the rare combination of beauty and innocence.  She stands

in the chilly basement in an elegant summer dress that outlines

her slender body.  Her gentle eyes move across the empty room and

come to rest on a rack of wine bottles covering one entire wall.

She walks to the bottles.  Her fingertips slide over the labels.

She stops when she finds just the right one.  A tiny smile as she

slides it out.

Anna turns to leave.  Stops.  She stares at the shadowy basement.

It's an unsettling place.  She stands very still and watches her

breath form a TINY CLOUD IN THE COLD AIR.  She's visibly

uncomfortable.

Anna Crowe moves for the staircase in a hurry.  Each step faster

than the next.  She climbs out of the basement in another burst

of LIGHT, QUICK FOOTSTEPS.

WE HEAR HER HIT THE LIGHT SWITCH.

THE LIGHTBULB DIES.  DRIPPING BLACK DEVOURS THE ROOM.

INT. DINING ROOM - EVENING

Two place settings are arranged on the living room coffee table.

Take-out Chinese food sits half eaten on good china.  An empty

bottle of red wine sits between boxes of Chinese food.

Anna arrives with the backup bottle and is now wearing a sweater.

She hands a collegiate rowing team sweatshirt to Malcolm.

MALCOLM CROWE sits on the floor at the coffee table, his vest and

tie on the sofa behind him.  A jacket and an overcoat lay on a

brirfcase next to him.

Malcolm is in his thirties with thick, wavy hair and striking,

intelligent eyes that squint from years of intense study.  His

charming, easy-going smile spreads across his face.  He points.

Malcolm points to the HUGE FRAMED CERTIFICATE propped up on a

dining room chair.  It's printed on aged parchment-type paper.

The frame is a polished mahogany.

He slips on the sweatshirt.

Anna hands the backup bottle over to Malcolm.

Malcolm uncorks the wine and starts pouring in the empty glass.

Anna giggles.  She's clearly buzzed herself.  Malcolm doesn't get

it.  Anna takes a few calming sips of her wine.  Her attention

slowly moves to the framed certificate.

Anna ignores Malcolm and clears her throat.  She leans forward

her seat and reads the certificate out loud as Malcolm tries to

tickle her.

Beat.  The power of the words sobers the two of them.

Anna turns to Malcolm.  He smiles.

Anna's expression becomes serious.

She just keeps staring.  Beat.

Beat.

Malcolm plays softly with her face.  Anna takes his hands and

holds them steady.

Anna lets go of his hands.  Anna's eyes are emotional.  Malcolm

smiles softly.

Anna leans towards him.  They hold each other tight.  Beat.

Anna laughs as she wipes her eyes.

Malcolm's charming, easy-going smile returns.

Anna hands him his glass.  He stares at it.

Malcolm looks at Anna surprised at what he said.  They crack up

laughing.  THEIR SWEET LAUGHTER FILLS THE HOUSE.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

TWO GIGGLING SHADOWS APPEAR IN THE BEDROOM DOORWAY.  They try to

turn on the light.  It doesn't come on.

Anna giggles some more as Malcolm's shadow stumbles across the

bedroom.

MALCOLM TURNS ON THE BATHROOM LIGHT.

A SHAFT OF LIGHT falls on Anna as she stands in the corner of the

room.

Anna smiles playfully and pulls off her sweater.  She sways to a

pretend striptease song.

Malcolm can't hold back his grin.  He joins in -- slowly peeling

off the sweat-shirt.  He looks back to Anna.  She's stopped her

playful dance.  She's facing away from him.

He walks towards her.  HIS GRIN QUIETLY DISAPPEARS.  Malcolm's

face turns to rock as his attention is drawn to the SHATTERED

WINDOW in their bedroom.  The wind moves through the room.  A

lamp lays broken on the ground by the window.

Malcolm kneels down.  Beat.  Anna's eyes fill with a quiet

awareness.

A SHADOW FROM THE BATHROOM FLATS OVER BOTH OF THEM.

ANNA SCREAMS.

Malcolm spins around.  His heart stops.

Malcolm and Anna stare at the bathroom doorwary.  They know

someone is inside.  Beat.

Malcolm slowly starts towards the door.  The first thing that

comes into view are the clothes on the bathroom floor.  Then the

figure of a man comes into view.  A STRANGER stands bare chested

in the back of the bathroom.

NO ONE MAKES A SOUND.

The STRANGER is about nineteen.  Drugged out.  Pitch black eyes

bulging.  His body is covered in scars and bruises.  His hands

are folded in front of him.  He shakes ever so slightly.  He has a

patch of white in his hair.

Malcolm speaks in a very calm voice.  Never takes his eyes off

the stranger.

Anna barely nods her understanding.

The stranger slowly looks up for the first time.  His eyes lock

on Malcolm.

Beat.

The stranger suddenly comes forward into the doorway.  Malcolm

stumbles back onto the edge of the bed.

Anna sees the stranger for the first time.  Her face drains of

color.

The stranger looks at Malcolm.  He half grins.

The stranger's stare slides to Anna.

The stranger gazes at Anna.  Gazes directly into her eyes.  A

penetrating, unwavering stare.

Anna's expression instanly changes.

BEAT.  THE ROOM GOES SILENT.

The stranger turns and glares at Malcolm.

Malcolm stops all movement.

Malcolm can't speak.  Beat.  The stranger's face starts to

tremble.

Beat.  Malcolm's intelligent eyes race for answers.

Malcolm looks like someone hit him with a sledgehammer.

Tears jump into the stranger's eyes.

Malcolm stands.

Malcolm's shaking hands touch his mouth as he stares at the

stranger.  Beat.

Tears fall down the stranger's face.

Malcolm looks up at the sound of those words.  Something clicks

in his head.

THE ROOM GOES SILENT AGAIN.

VINCENT GRAY stares with surprise through his tears.

Malcolm lets out a deep breath like he just emerged from deep

waters.

Vincent's eyes burn at Malcolm.

VINCENT is fully crying now.

Vincent turns to the sink.  His hand goes in.  He turns arund and

raises a gun at Malcolm.  He FIRES.  A VIOLENT, EAR-SHATTERING

ECHO.  Malcolm clutches his stomach and folds like a rag doll

onto the bed.

Vincent instantly moves the gun to his own head.  ANOTHER

HORRIFIC BLAST SPIKES THE AIR.  Vincent crumples onto the

bathroom floor.

ANNA'S CHILLING SCREAMS FILL THEIR HOME.

EXT. BENCH - AFTERNOON

The legend, "Two Years Later" appears.

A man flips open a worn file folder on his lap.  Handwritten

notes fill every line.  At the top of the first page reads,

"Vincent Gray, age 10, Referred January 19, 1989."

The man's hand touches the name almost reverently.

He glances through the page.  Words and phrases are circled

throughout the file.

"...Acute anxiety"

"...Socially isolated"

"...Possible mood disorder"

"...Parent status -- Divorced"

"...Communication difficulty between mother-child dyad"

The man's hands flip the page.  At the top of this new page

reads, "Cole Sear, age 8, Referred September 1998."

As the man's fingers move through the notes we again see words

and phrases circled throughout this new case history.

"...Acute anxiety"

"...Socially isolated"

"...Possible mood disorder"

"...Parent status -- Divorced"

"...Communication difficulty between mother-child dyad"

The hands close the notepad.  The hands are slightly shaking now.

WE PULL BACK to reveal the shaking hands belong to Dr. Malcolm

Crowe.

Malcolm sits on a sidewalk bench facing a row of brownstone homes

across the street.  He gazes blankly at the brownstones.  Beat.

A door opens.  Malcolm is brought out of his trance.

COLE SEAR steps out his front door.  Cole is a munchkin of a boy

with large, black eyes that seem to take in everything around

him.

His hair is dark, with a small patch of jet white on the side.

Cole carefully locks the door behind him.

He moves to the bottom of the stairs and looks around nervously.

Anxiously.

The eight-year-old child reaches into his pocket and slips on a

pair of VERY LARGE GLASSES.  They look comical on him.

Malcolm rises to his feet.  He smooths out his shirt.  Looks down

and buttons his jacket.

When he looks up, Cole is gone.

Malcolm barely catches a glimpse of the boy.  Cole runs at full

speed down the street and turns the corner.  TINY SNEAKERS

SCREECHING ON THE SIDEWALK.

For a second, Malcolm doesn't react.  The second passes.  He

stuffs the file in his bag and starts running too.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Malcolm hauls down the sidewalk.  He comes to a hard stop at a

street intersection.  Searches.  Spots Cole running into a

parking lot.

COLE sprints across the empty lot and reaches the doors of a

building.  He has to use all his strength to push open the highly

ornate doors.  He slips inside.

Malcolm jogs into the parking area.  His pace slows to a walk and

then to stillness as he gazes up at the building.  Its old stone

and huge towers make it stand out from the modern buildings all

around it.  Malcolm stares up at the historic Philadelphia church

quietly.

A SHOOTING PAIN PIERCES HIS SIDE.  Malcolm's hand goes to it

quickly.  He waits for it to pass before starting for the ornate

doors.

INT. CHURCH - DAY

Only a few people sit and pray in the sea of oak pews.

Malcolm scans the majestic room and finds what he's looking for

in the last row of the church.

He moves down the center aisle towards the back.

Malcolm finds Cole playing in his pew with a set of green and

beige plastic soldiers.  Cole makes the soldiers talk to each

other.

The words are unintelligible.

Cole senses someone.  He looks up and sees Malcolm staring at

him.  The boy immediately goes white.  Every cell of his body

still with fear.

Cole stays rigid.  Hands clutching a handful of plastic riflemen.

Malcolm waits for a response.  None comes.

Beat.  Cole slowly slides down the pew, giving Malcolm most of

the seat.  Malcolm sits.

Cole fidgets with his soldiers.  Beat.  Malcolm looks over and

stares at Cole's glasses.  He leans forward to inspect them more

carefully.

Malcolm returns to staring at his lap.  Beat.

Malcolm stares surprised.

Malcolm nods at the information.

Malcolm smiles at Cole.  His eyes drift down to Cole's arms.

Malcolm's smile slowly disappears.

Cole's arms are covered in TINY CUTS AND BRUISES.  Some almost

healed.  Some fresh.  Malcolm looks around to gather himself.

Beat.

Cole looks up.

Malcolm studies Cole's anxious face.

Malcolm and Cole just stare at each other.

Beat.

Malcolm smiles.

Cole pockets his soldiers and rises from his pew.

Cole thinks it over carefully.

Cole and Malcolm just stare at each other.

Cole turns and starts to the rear of the church.  Malcolm loses

himself in his thoughts.

When Malcolm looks back, he sees Cole stop by the exit doors and

take a tiny STATUE OF JESUS off the back table.  Cole pockets the

statue and quietly leaves the church.

Malcolm just sits and stares.

INT. MALCOLM'S HOME - EVENING

The house is dimly lit.  Malcolm has to turn on the HALLWAY LIGHT.

He stops before a pile of mail collecting on a thin table.  He

stares at it blankly.  Almost every envelope has "Over Due" or

"Final Notice" stamped on it.

INT. DINING TABLE - EVENING

Malcolm stares down at the remains of a meal on the only place

setting on the table.

INT. BEDROOM - EVENING

Malcolm quietly walks into his bedroom.  Only A READING LIGHT IS

ON.  THE SOFT LIGHT FALLS ON ANNA AS SHE SLEEPS.

Malcolm moves to her side.  The sight of her stops him.

He stares at his wife...

She huddles under a blanket, a wad of tissues in her hand.  He

takes it in silently.

His eyes move to her face...  One wisp of hair falls over her

soft lips.  OUTLINED IN THE SOFT READING LIGHT, Anna Crowe truly

looks like an angel.

Malcolm forms a tiny smile.

INT. HALL - NIGHT

Malcolm turns and moves for a narrow door in the hallway.

THE DOOR KNOB.  He tries to open it.  IT'S LOCKED.  Malcolm

reaches into his pockets.  Searches for his keys.

INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

The empty basement is no longer empty.  It's piled with file

cabinets and boxes of psychology and medical books.  A desk sits

in the corner next to the wine racks.

The room still feels unsettling.

Malcolm hunches over one of the books.  Rifles through a stack of

dusty books.  Pulls out a thick text.

The spine of the text reads, "The Meridian Latin Dictionary."

Malcolm sits back at his desk and opens Cole's file.  Handwritten

on the first page are the words,

Malcolm starts working through the Latin text.  As he comes to

each word, he jots it down underneath the Latin.

Malcolm translates the last word.

He stares quietly at the paper.  The new words reads...

Beat.

The words seem to hang in the air forever.

EXT. PHILADELPHIA - DAWN

Old Philadelphia awakens...  For a moment, it's like we're back

in time.

A golden sun dances on the waters of Penns Landing.  Historical

old ships sit docked in its harbor...  The dark bronze surface of

the Liberty Bell reflects the dawn...  A majestic Independence

Hall stands watch as its city begins to stir...  A thirty foot

statue of Ben Franklin makes a proud silhouette against the

morning sky...

AND THEN 1997 COMES CRASHING IN.

FLUORESCENT HOUSE LIGHTS COME ON IN WINDOWS...  Jeeps and

hatchbacks start roaming the cobblestone streets...  Neon

restaurants signs flicker to life...  Traffic helicopters make

their rounds...  CAR ALARMS PIERCE THE AIR.

INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - MORNING

A hand turns off a radio, shutting off the morning news.

A small dog with two different colored eyes sticks his head out

of the dryer, where he plays with the newly-dried clothes.

LYNN SEAR reaches in and pulls out a blouse.

She shakes it in the air and slips it on as she dresses hurriedly

for work.

Lynn is a woman in her late twenties.  One hundred percent South

Philly.  Hair teased.  She chews on an early morning piece of

Trident.  Under all of it, Lynn Sear is an attractive and

sweet-looking young woman.

Lynn enters THE KITCHEN through a swinging door.

A bowl of cereal and milk sit on a table in an empty kitchen.

Lynn stares at a handful of kitchen CABINETS and DRAWERS that are

open.

Lynn shakes her head.

She closes them one at a time before moving to the coffee machine.

Lynn shivers a little.  She leans over the thermostat and raises

the heat.  She returns to her post at the coffee machine.

TINY FOOTSTEPS.

Lynn turns to see Cole standing in his private school uniform.

Lynn walks over to Cole.  Checks his tie.

Lynn unclips the tie.  Cole takes a seat at the kitchen table as

Lynn walks back into the laundry room.

The dog is gone now.  Lynn reaches into the dryer, digging for a

new tie.  She finds one, then turns and steps back into the

kitchen and SCREAMS AT THE TOP OF HER LUNGS.

Every cabinet and every drawer is wide open.

Cole sits at the kitchen table.  His hands are pressed flat on

the tabletop.

He looks shaken.

Neither says anything for a beat.

Beat.

Lynn looks over to the open cabinet near the sink.  The pop tarts

are clearly visible.

Cole gets up from the table.  Takes his pop tarts.  Doesn't make

eye contact.

Lynn leans down.

Cole does.

He looks at her eyes.  Beat.

THE DOOR BELL RINGS.

Cole quietly kisses his mother on the cheek and starts out.

Cole turns to see Lynn holding the pop tarts.  He walks back and

takes them from her before leaving.

Beat.  Lynn glances to the kitchen table.  Her gaze stops on the

TWO TINY HAND PRINTS OF SWEAT formed on the table's surface.

Lynn stands motionless in the kitchen.  She looks up and wraps

her arms around her shivering shoulders.

EXT. BROWNSTONE STREET - MORNING

TOMMY TAMMISIMO is a tough-looking, eight-year-old Italian kid

who waits at the bottom of Cole's brownstone stairs in his school

uniform.

Cole emerges from the brownstone and moves down the steps.

Lynn's face appears in the kitchen window.

The two boys begin their walk down the street to school.  Tommy

puts his arm around Cole.  Lynn waves.  Cole waves back.

When the two boys turn the corner and are out of Lynn's sight,

Tommy rips his arm away.

Tommy starts to run ahead, he turns and back pedals.

Tommy runs away.

Beat.  Cole looks around nervously.

EXT. ST. ANTHONY'S ACADEMY - MORNING

The last uniformed boys and girls rush into the front doors of

St. Anthony's Academy as the FINAL BELL SOUNDS.

Cole is the last one to go in.  He stands alone on the sidewalk.

He looks like he'd rather be anywhere but there.

Beat.

He buries his hands in his pockets and begins a quiet walk by

himself into the school.

INT. COLE'S HOME - AFTERNOON

The front door CREAKS open as Cole walks in after school.  He

looks around before closing the door.  His eyes stop on Lynn

seated in the open doorway of the den.  Malcolm is seated with

her.  They both look up.

Lynn comes out.  She reaches Cole -- kneels down in front of him.

Cole shrugs.

Cole doesn't respond.  Beat.

Cole shakes his head "No."

Cole starts to smile too.  He thinks.

Cole and Lynn smile at each other.  Beat.

Lynn tries to hide the utter sadness behind her smile.

Lynn takes Cole's school bag and jacket before moving to the

kitchen.

INT. DEN - AFTERNOON

The den doubles as a playroom.  Boxes of old toys sit in the

corner.  A small, plastic, multi-colored table sits on the rug.

Cole appears in the doorway.  Malcolm sits up and smiles.

He points to the chair on the other side of the coffee table.

Cole nods very softly, "No."

Cole nods again very softly, "No."

Cole looks a little more interested.

Cole nods, "No."

Cole tilts his head, then nods, "Yes."

Malcolm presses his fingers to his temples like a vaudeville

magician.  He closes his eyes tight.

Beat.  Cole, surprised, takes a small step forward.

Cole takes a step.  Malcolm opens his eyes.  He looks right at

Cole.

Beat.  Cole takes another step.  The next step will put him at

the chair.  Malcolm lowers his fingers from his temple.

Malcolm smiles.  Returns his fingers to the mind-reading

position.  Malcolm looks to Cole's arm.  Cole is wearing A LARGE

SILVER WATCH.  It swims on his thin wrist.  It could probably

slide up to his shoulder.  Malcolm closes his eyes.

Cole takes a step BACK.  Beat.  Malcolm lowers his hands

surprised.

Beat.  Malcolm puts his fingers to his temple.  This time a

little bit slower.  He gazes at Cole's school uniform.

Beat.  Cole takes a slow step back.  Beat.

AN UNCOMFORTABLE SILENCE OVERTAKES THE DEN.

Cole answers by taking a small step back.  Beat.

Malcolm looks down at Cole's feet.  They're almost at the

doorway.  One more step and he's there.  Cole is very still.  He

doesn't move at all.

Malcolm takes his time before speaking.  He just stares.  No

fingers to the temple.  No games.  He just stares.  Beat.

Cole quietly takes a step back into the doorway of the other room.

Cole's tiny figure steps away.  Malcolm stares helplessly at the

empty doorway where his client used to stand.

THE DEN IS SUFFOCATED WITH SILENCE.

INT. RESTAURANT - EVENING

Malcolm hurriedly enters a spacious, dimly-lit Italian

restaurant.  He stops in the dining room and searches the many

candle-lit tables.  He finds Anna.

Anna sits alone at a corner table.  The remains of her half-eaten

dinner lay on the only place setting on the table.  A small PIECE

OF CAKE WITH A CANDLE in it sits untouched.

Anna stirs sugar in her coffee as Malcolm sits in the seat across

from her.  She gently stops stirring, but doesn't look up.  Beat.

Anna isn't laughing.  Not even close.

Anna quietly takes a sip from her coffee.

Anna looks around for the waiter.

That makes Anna turn back.  She glances across the table, then

looks down.

Malcolm demonstrates by holding up his arm to shield his face.

Malcolm loses himself in his thoughts.  The waiter drops off the

check on the table.  Anna grabs it before Malcolm and quickly

signs it.

Beat.

Anna waits till he's done and rises from the table.  She pushes

her chair in hard and walks away without a word.  Malcolm sits

alone and stares at the piece of cake with a candle on it.

EXT. FRONT STEPS - AFTERNOON

Cole is seated on the front stoop of his brownstone.  On the

steps and on the landing are his plastic soldiers in the grips of

a war.

Malcolm sits with his bag and overcoat on the step next to him.

Malcolm just observes quietly.  Beat.

Cole glances up as he plays.  Sees Malcolm's expression.

On the step are two rows of soldiers facing each other.  To one

side are a couple soldiers covered by a tissue.  Malcolm points

to them.

Cole removes the tissue.

Cole points to the other soldier.

Beat.  Cole's face becomes emotional.  Tears fill his eyes.

Malcolm falls into silence and stares at his client.  Beat.  Cole

wipes his eyes quickly.

Malcolm takes in Cole's gesture and expression.

Malcolm looks down.

Cole points to the corner of the street.  Malcolm slowly turns.

He sits in profile to Cole.  Beat.

Malcolm continues to stare at the street.  Beat.

Cole doesn't answer.

Cole taps his foot once.

Malcolm sits patiently.  Beat.  They don't say anything for a

while.

Cole looks up from his soldiers.  Malcolm stares at the far side

of the street.

Cole taps his foot twice.

EXT. STREET - AFTERNOON

The two of them walk down a row of brownstones across from a park

where children Cole's age are playing.

Cole almost smiles.

Cole shakes his head, "No.!

Malcolm thinks for a bit.

Cole nods "Yes."

Malcolm stops walking.  The words hit him hard.  He stares at

Cole.

Beat.  Cole is surprised.

Malcolm's face is filled with emotion.  Cole is suddenly hit by

Malcolm's passion.  Beat.  Cole nods slowly as he looks at

Malcolm with different eyes.

They start walking again in silence.  They turn a corner and move

down another street.  Cole spots an old man with a cane standing

at the gate of a brownstone.

Malcolm nods "yes" as they continue walking.  Cole slows as they

approach the old man.  As we get closer, we make out the man can

barely see.

MR. MARSCHAL leans over his gate and stares at Cole for a few

seconds.

Mr. Marschal has a thick German accent.  The old man squints down

the block with a concerned expression.

Beat.

Malcolm's eyes dart to Cole.

Mr. Marschal smiles at Cole before walking back inside his house.

Cole turns back to Malcolm.

INT. MR. MARSCHAL'S LIVING ROOM - MORNING

This brownstone has been home to the Marschal's for many, many

years.  It's filled with a lifetime of memories.  Memories shared

by two people.

Two rocking chairs sit side by side near the windows that

overlook the street...  A corner table displays fancy wooden

chess set.  The game half-finished, frozen in a layer of dust...

An easel stands before a piano.  The incomplete water color

painting of a smiling elderly woman sitting on the piano bench

sits sadly on the faded yellow paper.

Malcolm takes in the living room silently.  He stands near the

open door.

Cole walks through the room.  Tiny eyes searching carefully.  He

leans behind the sofa looking for something.  Malcolm watches

Cole with a crinkled brow.

Cole peeks behind the old piano crammed against the wall.

Cole turns to find Mr. Marschal standing with a glass of

lemonade.  Cole takes it from his shaking hands.

Mr. Marschal shuffles over to the sofa.  Takes a seat.

Cole begins surveying the room again.  Beat.  His eyes finally

come to rest on a plant seated in the corner.  He stares at it...

THE LEAVES OF THE PLANT SHAKE SLIGHTLY FROM A BREEZE.

Cole puts down his glass on a table and walks over to the plant.

Cole kneels down and starts to push the potted plant aside.  THE

POT SCREECHES ON THE WOODEN FLOOR.

Malcolm calls to Cole under his breath.

Mr. Marschal strains to see across the room.

Cole doesn't answer either of them.  Instead, he continues to

push the plant aside revealing AN AIR VENT.  Cole gently reaches

over and takes off the metal face.  It slips right off.

Cole's hands disappear into the darkness of the vent.  They

reemerge holding a STACK OF NOTEBOOKS.

Malcolm becomes very still.

Cole rises to his feet and carries the notebooks over to Mr.

Marschal.  Cole carefully places them on his lap.

Mr. Marschal fingers the notebooks then reaches for his thick

glasses hanging from his neck.  He places them on the tip of his

nose and inspects the notebooks six inches from his face.

Malcolm takes an involuntary step forward.

Mr. Marschal starts flipping through the notebooks.

He gets to the last book.  His hands become still as he stares at

the final page of writing.

Beat.  Mr. Marschal slowly looks up from the notebooks.  Looks up

to Cole.  Cole just stands quietly.

Mr. Marschal's eyes slowly fill with tears of realization.  They

gently spill down his weathered face.

Cole takes a deep breath.  Trying hard not to cry himself.  The

sight of Mr. Marschal weeping shakes Cole.

Cole softly lays his hand on Mr. Marschal's silver hair.  Mr.

Marschal reaches up and clutches his small hand.

They stay like that for a while.  Beat.  Mr. Marschal lets go and

brings the notebooks tighter to his body.

Cole quietly walks to Malcolm who stands motionless.  He stares

down at Cole in a daze.

Cole turns his head, crying.

INT. BASEMENT OFFICE - NIGHT

Malcolm sits still in his office chair.  His eyes are fixed at a

point in space.  He brings a slim, black tape recorder to his

mouth.

CLICK.

A long silence.  CLICK.  The tape recorder turns off.

INT. BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

Lynn holds a laundry basket on her hip as she fiddles with the

thermostat in the hall.  The house is cold.  Lynn wears a winter

jacket in the house.

Lynn turns and moves into the shadowy hallway.  No lights.  The

house seems somewhat ominous.  Beat.

Lynn's eyes dart to an open guest room like she just saw

something.  She stares in the doorway until a SOUND TURNS HER IN

THE DIRECTION OF THE FAMILY ROOM.

She picks up balled-up boy's sweat socks and dirty T-shirts

laying on the carpet.  When she reaches the end of the hall, she

HITS A LIGHT SWITCH.  The hall LIGHTS UP REVEALING A WALL OF

PHOTOS.  Lynn forms a tiny smile.

Snapshots of Cole and Lynn's life hang before her eyes.

Cole's birthday parties...  Lynn and Cole at an amusement park...

Cole under the Christmas tree...  Cole on Lynn's shoulders in a

pool...  Cole with a group of neighbors at a barbecue...

Lynn takes a step forward.  Lynn's face betrays the fact that she

notices something she never noticed before.  She touches a photo

of three-year-old Cole.

WE MOVE INTO THE PHOTO -- COLE'S FACE SMILES AT US.  LYNN'S

FINGER GENTLY BRUSHES A THIN STREAKS OF LIGHT THAT CURVES IN THE

BACKGROUND BEHIND COLE.  THE STREAK OF LIGHT IS BLURRED, LIKE

SOMETHING CAUGHT IN MOTION.

Lynn looks to the adjacent photo -- the barbecue photo --

Everyone stands with hot dogs and sodas.  Lynn searches the

picture.  Her eyes suddenly stop at the TINIEST BLUR OF WHITE

LIGHT STREAKING AROUND COLE.

WE MOVE FROM FRAMED PHOTO TO FRAMED PHOTO -- EACH THE SAME --

SOMEWHERE HIDDEN IN THE FRAME, SOMEWHERE NOT EASILY SEEN, LYNN

FINDS A BLUR.

Lynn takes it all in curiously.

INT. COLE'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

Lynn moves into Cole's room with the laundry basket balanced on

her hip.  The Walkman headphones on her head blares A MUFFLED

TECHNO DANCE BEAT.  Lynn starts picking clothes up around Cole's

room.

This bedroom is an eerie place.  The shadows seem to make shapes

and figures.  All the furniture is wood -- old fashioned.  The

lamps, the paintings on the wall -- antiques as well.

The most striking feature of the room, however, is the homemade

tent created from bedsheets and blankets tied to chairs and

bureaus.  It takes up a large corner of the room.

A sign hangs over the bedsheets.

Lynn grabs the spiderman P.J.s that drape over the tent.

A German Shepherd Puppy sleeps on the pillow.  SEBASTIAN lifts

his head sleepily and peers at Lynn before returning to his

slumber.

Lynn slowly reaches for a picture frame that peeks out from under

Cole's pillow.  Slides it out...  It's a VACATION PHOTO of a

couple.  Lynn and Cole and a man.  The man looks in every way a

larger version of Cole.

The picture has a visible effect on Lynn.  She lets out a shaky

breath before returning the photo to its hiding place.

Lynn pulls a pair of school uniform pants off the wooden roll

cover desk next to the bed.

The desk is covered with loose leaf papers filled with writings.

Lynn's eyes are drawn to the papers.

Her curious gaze turns serious.  Her mouth opens a tiny bit

involuntarily.

THE PAPERS are strewn with lines of handwriting.  Countless

lines.  Thousands of words...  Some horizontal, some vertical...

The writing moves in arcs and flows in various size -- written at

great speed -- every word connected by a single pen stroke --

everything written in one continuous motion.

Lynn slowly spins the papers, taking in some of the phrases...

going on Quiet the damn baby I'll cut you I swear it someone stop

the burning I'll kill you I'll kill all you bastard...

The words go on and on.

Lynn removes her hands from the paper.  She pulls her headphones

off slowly.

THE MUFFLED TECHNO DANCE BEAT FILLS THE DEAD SILENCE OF THE EERIE

ROOM.

INT. DEN - AFTERNOON

Malcolm stares as the rain pelts the windows of the den.

Beat.

Cole is playing behind the couch.  All we see is the top of his

head.

Every now and then we get glimpses of things Cole is playing with

peeking over the back of the couch, but we can't quite make out

what he's doing.

The top of Cole's head stops moving.

Cole shakes his head, "No."

Cole has become very still.  He looks right at Malcolm.

Beat.  Cole nods, "Yes."

Beat.

Beat.

Malcolm watches him carefully.  Beat.  Malcolm waves the question

off casually.

Malcolm smiles.  He rises and grabs his coat.

Cole's brow furrows as he thinks about it carefully.

Malcolm heads for the door, stops when Cole emerges from behind

the couch.  Cole is wearing his father's jacket, it hangs to the

ground like a dress.

Malcolm turns back to Cole.  Malcolm nods "Yes."  Beat.

Cole's sad eyes stare up at Malcolm.

INT. BASEMENT OFFICE - NIGHT

The surface of Malcolm's desk is covered with open texts.

Malcolm pours over a thick reference book.

He circles a phrase...

"...resulting bruises and abrasions on arms and legs may, in

fact, be self-inflicted."

Malcolm appears disturbed by the thoughts running through his

head.

ANNA'S MUFFLED VOICE CARRIES DOWN THE STAIRS.

His face turns up to the ceiling.

WE HEAR ANNA'S FOOTSTEPS MOVE ACROSS THE BASEMENT CEILING.  WE

HEAR THE FRONT DOOR OPEN.

Malcolm gets up and moves closer to their voices as he stretches

his legs.

Malcolm smiles at Anna.

Malcolm slowly stops smiling.

Malcolm shakes his head in disbelief.

WE HEAR THE FRONT DOOR SHUT.

Malcolm moves to the narrow basement window.

INT./EXT. MALCOLM'S HOUSE - DAY

We see SEAN, an attractive young man in his late twenties.

He gets into his car across the street.  He just sits there for a

moment before putting his forehead to the steering wheel.

Malcolm turns away from the window as Sean's car starts up and

pulls away from Malcolm's house.

INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

STANLEY CUNNINGHAM is a teacher in his late forties.  He writes a

question on the board.

Mr. Cunningham turns and stares at his class of eight and nine

year old private school students.  They stare back at him blankly.

Cole rests his chin on his desk and watches the class with big

eyes.

The class says the answer in unison.

Stanley Cunningham looks over the class of blank faces.  He's

just about to answer his own question when he sees a hand go up.

Mr. Cunningham looks surprised to see who it is.

Mr. Cunningham furrows his brow.  Beat.

Beat.

Mr. Cunningham chuckles.  Cole's face turns cement grey.

Tommy Tammisimo leads the class in a wave of snickering.

Cole glances up.  Sees all the eyes on him.  He glances at the

teacher who is still staring.

Mr. Cunningham sees the traumatized expression on Cole's face and

instantly stops smiling.

Mr. Cunningham's face becomes still.  So does the classroom.

The class falls into stunned silence.  Mr. Cunningham takes an

involuntary step towards Cole's desk.

Mr. Cunningham moves closer to Cole.

Cole covers his eyes with his hands.

We see Cole's mouth under his covered eyes.

Mr. Cunningham is standing right over Cole's desk now.

MR. CUNNINGHAM SLAMS HIS HAND ON COLE'S DESK.  Cole's hands drop

from his eyes.  The teacher's face is burning red.

The children in the room are frozen.  Completely startled.

Cole's eyes are filled with tears.

Mr. Cunningham's expression drains of anger as Cole Sear begins

to cry.

INT. ANTHONY'S LIBRARY - SAME AFTERNOON

Cole is seated in the school library by himself.  He sits at a

long center table near the windows.  His head is laying on his

folded arms on the table.

Malcolm peeks his head in the door -- unsure if he's in the right

place.  He spots Cole and enters the room.  He silently takes a

seat across from Cole.  The eight-year-old looks up.  Cole's eyes

are hard -- filled with anger.

Cole stares for a second.

Cole lowers his head.  Malcolm just sits and thinks.

THE SOUND OF BOYS PLAYING SPORTS ON THE FIELD OUTSIDE FILTER IN

THROUGH THE LIBRARY WINDOWS.

Cole turns his head and stares at the windows.  Malcolm takes in

the sad vision of this boy.  It affects him.  Beat.

Cole's face softens a bit.  He turns from the windows and looks

to Malcolm.  Beat.  Cole nods, "Yes."

Malcolm pulls out a penny from his pocket.  He places it in his

right hand.

Malcolm closes his hand around the penny.

Malcolm shakes his hand in circles.  Cole watches his hand

carefully.

Cole looks to Malcolm's closed left hand.  Malcolm doesn't open

it.

Cole's eyes lock on Malcolm's shirt.  Malcolm taps the pocket but

doesn't open it.

Malcolm opens his right hand.  The penny sits quietly in the

center of his palm.

Cole looks at the penny and then up to Malcolm's face.  Beat.

Cole cracks a smile.

Malcolm smiles a mischievous smile.  He places the penny on the

table.  Cole stares at it and then looks to Malcolm.

Malcolm and Cole share a warm look.

THE SOUNDS OF KIDS LAUGHING AND PLAYING OUT ON THE FIELD COME

POURING INTO THE ROOM AGAIN.

Cole's expression changes back to sadness as he looks to the

windows.  Malcolm leans across the table and whispers.

Cole looks at Malcolm.

Beat.  Cole's chin starts to tremble.  His voice cracks.

Beat.

Malcolm and Cole sit in silence and listen to THE SOUND OF

CHILDREN PLAYING.

INT. HALLWAY - EVENING

Malcolm sorts through the many bills on the mail table.

Malcolm turns AT THE SOUND OF THE WOMAN, and moves into the empty

living room where the T.V. is on.  A blanket lays crumpled on the

sofa.

THE WOMAN'S VOICE IS COMING FROM A VIDEO PLAYING ON THE VCR.

IT'S A WEDDING VIDEO.  A LARGE WOMAN IN A BRIDESMAID DRESS STANDS

HOLDING THE MICROPHONE.   IN THE BACKGROUND, WE CAN SEE THE DANCE

FLOOR.

THE LARGE BRIDESMAID BECOMES VERY EMOTIONAL.

THE WOMAN HANDS THE MICROPHONE TO SOMEONE OFF SCREEN.  THE CAMERA

PANS AWAY FROM HER AND ZOOMS IN ON THE DANCE FLOOR.  MALCOLM AND

ANNA ARE SLOW DANCING.  THEY'RE WHISPERING AND LAUGHING WITH EACH

OTHER.  THE HAPPINESS FROM THEM IS TANGIBLE.

Malcolm can't help smiling as he stares at the flickering images.

He turns and looks down the hall to their bedroom.

INT. BEDROOM - EVENING

Malcolm moves into their bedroom.

THE SOUND OF A SHOWER CAN BE HEARD FROM THE BATHROOM.

Malcolm moves to the bathroom door and opens it slowly.

INT. BATHROOM - EVENING

Malcolm steps into the bathroom quietly.  He stares at the

silhouette of Anna's body through the smoked glass of the shower.

Anna stands still, her head tilted back.

Malcolm watches quietly.  By his experience, it's clear he's

taken by his wife's beauty.

Malcolm starts towards the shower when his eyes glance to the

sink.  Malcolm locks on a tiny bottle resting on the marble

surface.

He reaches out and picks it up.  The label on the plastic bottle

reads,

Malcolm gently puts down the plastic bottle.  He gazes at the

still figure of his wife as the water covers her.

Malcolm leaves the bathroom.  He makes sure not to make a noise

with the door as he closes it shut.

EXT. DARREN'S HOUSE - DAY

Colorful balloons flutter in the wind in front of an old grey

stone home.

INT. DINING ROOM - DAY

Cole and an overweight boy named BOBBY are seated at a dining

table covered in colorful paper.  A stack of birthday presents

are sitting on the table next to a cake.

The house is filled with the SOUND OF CHILDREN PLAYING AND

LAUGHING.

Cole and the overweight boy are the only ones in the dining room.

Bobby watches with a dull expression as Cole moves his hand in

circles in the air.

Cole smiles and holds out his hand.  His fingers open to reveal

the penny.

Bobby stares.

Cole loses his smile.

Cole and the overweight boy stare at each other.

Cole gives the boy his penny.  Beat.  Cole gazes at Bobby.

Bobby looks up sharply.

Bobby stares down at him before returning his attention to his

tattered napkin.

The two boys sit in silence.

INT. KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

Cole sits alone in the corner of the living room.  The open

kitchen doorway is next to him.  Inside the kitchen are Lynn and

DARREN'S MOM speaking.  It's clear they're from different worlds.

Lynn is wearing tight clothes with hair teased to dramatic

heights.  Darren's mom is in a designer suit.

Darren's mom smiles formally and turns to give the catering

people instructions on how to lay out the food on her sterling

silver trays.

Darren's mom turns back to Lynn, the forced smile on her face.

Lynn nods "Yes."

Darren's mom glances at her expensive watch.

Lynn drowns in her thoughts.  Cole moves away from the kitchen

with sad eyes.

INT. HALL - AFTERNOON

Cole walks past two expensively-dressed mothers eating hors

d'oeuvres as they move down the hallway.

They pass when Cole moves down the shiny mahogany wood hallway.

The women's conversation FADES AWAY behind him.

Cole turns a corner and comes to a dead stop.  He turns white as

he stares at an open CRAWL SPACE CLOSET a few feet away.  Cole's

eyes are riveted in the darkness of the closet.  Beat.

THE HALLWAY ERUPTS WITH NOISE AS THE CHILDREN RUN IN FROM THE

BACKYARD.

Tommy Tammisimo is one of the children.  He talks with the

birthday boy, DARREN, a skinny kid in a party hat.

Tommy glances down the hall and sees Cole standing frozen staring

at the crawl space closet.

Tommy grabs Darren.

Tommy nudges Darren to move down the hall.  Cole breaks from his

trance as Tommy and Darren walk up.

Tommy points to the crawl space.

Beat.  Tommy looks to Darren and then back to Cole.

Beat.

Tommy stares at Darren.  Darren finally gets it.

It happens too quick for Cole to react.  Darren and Tommy shove

Cole backwards.  He stumbles into the darkness of the crawl space.

Tommy slams the door closed.  Darren turns the lock.  They crack

smiles at each other as Cole bangs on the door.

The BANGING GOES ON FOR A FEW SECONDS AND THEN IT JUST STOPS.

SILENCE.

Darren and Tommy look at each other and then back at the crawl

space door.

Then THE SCREAMING BEGINS.

Darren and Tommy back away from the door as COLE SCREAMS IN

TERROR at the top of his lungs.  He CRASHES OVER AND OVER against

the door.  HIS BODY SLAMMING AGAINST THE WOOD.  The DOOR RATTLES

like it's going to break off its hinges.

The two boys are statues as Cole's BLOOD-CHILLING YELLS FILL THE

HALLWAY.

FOOTSTEPS SPIKE THE AIR AS children and mothers come running down

the hall.  Lynn is one of them.

Darren's mother turns the corner.

She looks to the closet.  THE HIGH-PITCHED SCREAMS CUT THROUGH

THE HALL.

Lynn and Darren's mom rush to the door and turn the knob...  The

door flies open.  Lynn reaches in and pulls out Cole.  He's

UNCONSCIOUS.

Darren's mom looks into the crawl space -- there's nothing inside

except a couple packing boxes in the back.  She looks to Lynn.

She turns around with Cole in her arms.

INT. HOSPITAL RECEPTION AREA - AFTERNOON

Colorful murals don the curved walls of the pediatric reception

area.

A spattering of children accompanied by adults sit and wait.

Lynn and Malcolm are seated at a children's play table.  A game

made of a maze of wires sit on the table in front of them.

A young resident DR. HILL takes a seat at the table with them.

He opens up his notes.

Beat.

Lynn closes her eyes.  Lets out a tense breath.  Beat.  Malcolm

eyes the doctor as he glances back to an academic-looking woman

standing at the reception room door.

Lynn opens her eyes and catches the doctor's expression.

Doctor Hill gestures to the woman standing near the doorway.

Dr. Hill stares at her before closing up his files.

Dr. Hill gets up.

Dr. Hill hands his files to MRS. SLOAN and exits the reception

room without looking back.

Everyone in the reception room stares at Lynn.  Mrs. Sloan walks

up to the table and waits.

Lynn takes a second.  Wipes her eyes.  Gathers her considerable

strength.  Beat.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

Cole lays rigid in the hospital bed.  Blankets bundled around him

as if to shield him.  Cole's eyes fixed out the window.

Malcolm quietly enters through the half-opened door to the room.

Cole spots him.  Visibly relaxes.

Cole smiles weakly as Malcolm takes a seat on a rolling metal

chair.

Malcolm notices Cole's legs emerging from under the hospital

gown.  Cole is wearing A MAN'S DRESS SOCK.  The baggy folds ride

up all the way to his knees.

Malcolm looks at Cole.  Malcolm makes a decision.  He rolls in

the chair across the room as he thinks.  Beat.

They sit in silence.  Malcolm works on a new plot in his head.

Beat.

Cole nods, "Yes."

Beat.  Malcolm's affected by his client.

Cole smiles softly.

Malcolm stares at the tired child sitting before him in the

hospital bed.

Malcolm rolls his stool away from his client as he thinks.

Beat.  He slowly moves the rolling chair closer to Cole's bed.

Malcolm breaks from his thoughts and looks at Cole who watches

him with unwavering attention.  Malcolm smiles.

Malcolm leans forward, whispers with emotional eyes.

Cole looks at Malcolm's caring eyes.  Cole stares at Malcolm a

long time.

EVERYTHING THAT'S SAID FROM THIS POINT ON IS WHISPERED.

Malcolm blinks very slowly.

Cole takes an eternal pause.  A silent tension engulfs them both.

Malcolm just gazes quietly.

Beat.

Cole shakes his head, "No."

Cole nods, "Yes."

Beat.

Malcolm becomes completely motionless.  Works to hide his shock.

He and Cole stare at each other a long time.

Beat.  Malcolm's words are extra-controlled.  Revealing nothing.

Beat.

Malcolm nods, "Yes."  Cole pulls the covers up to his chin and

turns to the window in the room.  Malcolm is very still and

stares at Cole.

MALCOLM'S EYES -- slowly turn and survey the room.  They find

nothing.  Malcolm returns to watching Cole.

COLE'S EYES LOOK AROUND THE ROOM WARILY...  WE MOVE IN ON THEM --

TILL HIS EYES FILL THE FRAME.

Beat.

And then we see what he's staring at.  Through Cole's hospital

room window we see the adjacent wing of the hospital building.

Rows of hospital room windows are visible.  In the windows are

patients...  SOME OLD, SOME YOUNG...  SOME ARE DRESSED IN MODERN

HOSPITAL GOWNS...  SOME FROM DECADES PAST.

THEY STAND UNNATURALLY STILL IN THEIR WINDOWS...  WATCHING,

WAITING.

EXT. STREET CORNER - NIGHT

Malcolm hails a cab.  He steps off the sidewalk lost in his

thoughts. Steam rises from a street vent.  HEADLIGHTS.  A CAR

SUDDENLY EMERGES FROM THE STEAM, NARROWLY MISSING MALCOLM.

Malcolm jerks out of the way.  His briefcase falls to the ground.

His tape recorder falls to the sidewalk.  Beat.  Malcolm reaches

down and picks it up.

CLICK.  Malcolm's hand with the tape recorder drops to his side.

Malcolm stares into the night.  He stands alone as thoughts crash

like thunder in his head.

INT. CAR - NIGHT

The STREETS TURN RED as Lynn drives home from the hospital in

silence.  She glances down to her right.

Cole is curled up asleep on the passenger seat, back in his

regular clothes, a tiny party hat clutched in his hand.  He looks

like a four-year-old.

The sight of him exhausted and still, hits Lynn hard.

Lynn's face drowns in deep concern.  She lays a hand on Cole's

head as she drives.

INT. COLE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

The front door opens, Lynn carries Cole in.  He's asleep on her

shoulder.  She carries him down the hall to his BEDROOM.

Lynn lays Cole gently on his bed next to his German Shepherd

Puppy.  Cole curls up with Sebastian.

Lynn watches the two youngsters sleep for a moment.  Cole is

curled up asleep with a tiny party hat clutched in his hands.  He

looks like a four-year-old.  Lynn has been carrying Cole's

sweater from over her shoulder.  She pulls it off and begins to

fold it.  Her attention is drawn to the sweater.  She fingers the

fabric of the back.  IT'S RIPPED.  Her eyes move to Cole.  In the

middle of the back of his T-shirt are THREE SMALL TEARS.  Lynn

pushes the fabric open with her fingers and sees DEEP FINGERNAIL

LIKE SCRATCHES on his skin.

Lynn looks around helplessly, fear creeping into her eyes.

INT. HALL - NIGHT

Lynn emerges from Cole's room.  She turns OFF THE HALL LIGHTS as

she moves into her room and closes the door.

WE HEAR LYNN PICK UP A PHONE AND DIAL.  Beat.

The thermostat on the wall reads seventy-eight degrees.

INT. HALL - NIGHT

A few hours later.  The house seems threateningly still.  Too

still.

INT. COLE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

An unnatural silence fills each room of the house.

The thermostat on the wall now reads, fifty-two degrees.

A LIGHT TURNS ON FROM UNDER COLE'S DOOR.

The door opens a crack.  Cole's tiny face peeks out.  Eyes scan

the darkness.

The door opens a little bit more.  Cole's knees are pressed

together.  His body dances a little.  Cole has to pee.  He moves

cautiously into the hall.

Cole moves briskly to a door halfway down the corridor.  Opens

it.  Cole turns on the LIGHT IN THE BATHROOM.

He checks behind the shower curtain, before he turns his back and

pees into the toilet.

A LARGE FIGURE MOVES PAST THE DOORWAY.

Cole instantly stops peeing.  His body becomes very still.  He

slowly reaches for the toilet handle and flushes.  He closes his

pants and turns.  He doesn't come out of the bathroom at first.

He just stands there and stares into the darkness of the hall.

HIS BREATH FORMS TINY CLOUDS IN THE COLD AIR.

Beat.  Cole finally steps out into the hallway.  His eyes catch a

SLANT OF LIGHT now coming from the kitchen.

Cole hesitates before being drawn to the kitchen.  He moves down

the hall and turns the corner -- coming to a stop in the doorway

of the kitchen.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

Cole stares at the back of a person cooking food on the stove.

Cole's fear slowly fades away.  Beat.

The person turns.  It's not Lynn.  It's a strange woman.  The

woman's face is demented.  A purple gash cuts across her

forehead.  ALL THE CABINETS AND DRAWERS ARE OPEN BEHIND HER.

Cole's face turns the color of ash.

Cole backs up to the doorway.

The woman smiles menacingly as she thrusts her wrists forward...

They've been savagely cut.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Cole turns and runs down the hall.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Cole runs across his room.

He heads right for the homemade tent seated in the corner with

the "DO NOT TOUCH" sign on it.  He scurries in.  His legs

disappear as the bedsheets flap closed behind him.

The crazed woman stands at the end of the hall.  Doesn't come any

closer.

INT. TENT - NIGHT

Cole is curled up in the tent.  He lays still for a moment

reaching over and FLICKING ON A FLASHLIGHT.

The red interior of the tent gets LIP UP.

It's a striking sight.  The bedsheet walls of the tent are lined

with religious pictures taped to the walls.  Tiny statues of

saints surround the interior perimeter.  We see the statue Cole

stole from the church is in here...  This tent is a sanctuary

made by an eight-year-old to hide in.

INT. AUDITORIUM STAGE - AFTERNOON

THE LIGHTS IN THE GYM GO DOWN.  THE SPOT LIGHT OPENS ON THE STAGE

AS THE CURTAINS MOVE TO THE SIDES...

A sign to the side of the stage reads, "The third and fourth

grade presents -- Rudyard Kipling's "The Jungle Book."

The parents APPLAUD AS TOMMY TAMMISIMO WALKS OUT ON STAGE in a

villager's outfit.

BACKSTAGE, Mr. Cunningham cues the rest of the children.

THE AUDIENCE APPLAUDS AS THE FULL CAST OF THE ACTORS COME OUT.

Some are villagers, others are dressed as trees and animals.

Cole comes on stage holding a painted cardboard monkey.

MALCOLM APPLAUDS FROM THE BACK OF THE AUDITORIUM.

INT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR - AFTERNOON

The arched halls of the private school are lined with posted

drawings and test papers.

Cole and Malcolm walk down an empty hall.

Beat.  They continue down the hall in silence.  Malcolm takes his

time.

Malcolm stops at a set of doors at the end of the hall --

realizes Cole is no longer next to him.  Malcolm turns to find

Cole frozen about ten feet back.

Malcolm walks to him.  He notices Cole's expression as he gets

closer.

Cole points to the doors.

Cole doesn't say anything.  Beat.

INT. GYMNASIUM - AFTERNOON

It's a large shadowy GYM.  Climbing ropes hang from the wood

beamed ceiling.

Cole is trembling slightly as he stands next to Malcolm.

Malcolm follows the child's gaze to the ceiling of the gym.

Beat.

Malcolm looks to Cole and then turns back to the ceiling.

Malcolm's body becomes very still.  Beat.

Malcolm looks at the wood beams and climbing ropes.

Beat.

Malcolm glances at Cole.  Surprise on his face.

Beat.

Malcolm looks at the empty stairwell and then back to Cole.

Nothing is said for a few moments.

Malcolm turns back to Cole, he finds the child with tears in his

eyes.  Cole looks at Malcolm desperately.

Malcolm stares helplessly.

Malcolm gently leads Cole away from the stairs.

COLE GLANCES BACK AS HE MOVES OUT OF THE STAIRWELL.

COLE'S P.O.V. -- The ropes and school banners dangling at the top

of the stairs sways a little...  But so do THE THREE BODIES

HANGING BY THEIR NECKS FROM A WOODEN BEAM.

It's a truly horrific sight.  A BLACK MAN in britches and no

shirt, face beaten to a pulp, hangs in the center.  A WHITE WOMAN

in a torn white frilly dress -- tears soaking her face, hangs to

the right.  A small MIXED RACE CHILD in half pants, hangs to

their left.  The family stares at Cole.  They follow Cole with

their tortured eyes as he exits the stairwell.

EXT. HISTORIC PHILADELPHIA - NIGHT

Malcolm walks from the bus stop over the cobblestone streets in

front of Head House Square.  The streets are quiet and dark.

Night time has fallen over the city.

He slowly comes to a stop in front of an old building.  He holds

his arm up.  Uses his other hand to gently touch his hairs on his

arm's surface.

Malcolm looks up slowly.  Looks around.  The dark shadows fill

the corners of the historic building...

Malcolm stares into the darkness...  Beat.

A long moment as he waits.  The shadows seem to move, then

becomes still.

Malcolm shakes off the moment.  He returns his hands to his

pockets as he moves through the dark streets of Philadelphia to

his home.

INT. HALL - NIGHT

The doorway to Malcolm and Anna's bedroom is open.  STRAINED

VOICES SPILL OUT INTO THE HALLWAY.

Beat.  THE PORTABLE PHONE RINGS OUT IN THE HALL.

WE HEAR MOVEMENT.  Anna emerges from the bedroom.  Eyes raw.  She

wipes her tears.

She picks up the phone and moves down the stairs.

Malcolm walks out into the hall.  Stops at the top of the stairs.

ANNA'S VOICE CAN BE HEARD SPEAKING ON THE PHONE from downstairs.

Malcolm doesn't hear anything as Anna listens to the person on

the phone.  She smiles as she wipes her tears.  He starts for the

basement door again.

Malcolm turns.  He stands frozen at the top of the stairs.

Anna's HUSHED WORDS RISING IN THE AIR LIKE A GUN BLAST.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

Lynn adjusts the thermostat as she tries to keep herself warm.

Lynn fiddles with the dials.  Cole is standing before the beat-up

twelve inch kitchen T.V.

ON THE TELEVISION SCREEN is Tommy Tammisimo.  He stands in his

pajamas in a doorway.  He coughs.

Cole watches as Tommy's T.V. mother and father give him a

spoonful of medicine.

Cole watches Tommy running around in his T.V. background, the

very next T.V. morning.  He's not sick anymore.  Tommy waves to

the camera smiling and healthy.  The T.V. goes BLACK as Cole

throws his shoe at the power button.

He moves to the dinner table where Lynn is seated.  Cole sits.

His hands go on the table.  He's wearing a pair of his father's

extra large LEATHER GLOVES.  Cole's small hands don't even fill

the palm area.  Cole has difficulty trying to pick up his milk

glass with the gloves.

Cole removes the gloves from his hand and places them next to his

plate.

Cole moves them to the floor.

Lynn is irritated, this is a sore point between them.

Lynn and Cole eat quietly.  Beat.

Cole looks up.  An anxious expression on his face.  Beat.

Cole just stares.

Cole looks down at his lap.

Cole shakes his head, "No."  Lynn just stares.

Cole doesn't answer.

Lynn just stares at Cole.

Lynn folds her napkin quietly.

Beat.  Cole's eyes start to water up.

Lynn goes cold.

Cole just stares at his mother's expression.

Cole gets up -- never taking his eyes off his mother -- and

leaves the room.

INT. HALL - NIGHT

Cole enters the DARK HALLWAY.  He gets startled by the SOUND OF

HIS PUPPY GROWLING.

Sebastian comes racing down the hall and scurries past Cole.

Cole watches his puppy dart into the living room and under a

couch.

Cole slowly turns back and looks down the hall.

THE DOOR TO COLE'S ROOM SITS AT THE END OF THE CORRIDOR.  IT'S

ALMOST SHUT.  COLE WATCHES AS THE DOOR BEGINS TO OPEN VERY

SLOWLY.  IT OPENS WIDE.  COLE DOESN'T MOVE AN INCH.

SUDDENLY IN THE STILLNESS AND THE DARKNESS, A SMALL FIGURE

SCURRIES FROM ANOTHER BEDROOM INTO THE BLACKNESS OF COLE'S ROOM.

IT HAPPENS LIKE A FLASH.

Cole stops breathing.

THE FIGURE SLOWLY STEPS OUT FROM COLE'S DOORWAY.

IT'S A BOY.  A FEW YEARS OLDER THAN COLE.

THE BOY WHISPERS IN A LOW, HOARSE VOICE.

THE BOY TURNS.  WE SEE THAT THE BACK OF HIS HEAD IS MISSING AS HE

DISAPPEARS INTO THE DARKNESS OF COLE'S ROOM.

Cole is too terrified to move.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

Lynn is kneeling on the kitchen floor trying to coax the puppy

out of the broom closet.

Lynn turns -- surprised to hear her son's voice.  Lynn's eyes are

red from crying.  She wipes them quickly with the back of her

hand.

Mother and son look at each other.  Beat.

Lynn fights back some tears.

Cole does.  Lynn smiles at her son.

Lynn hugs him.  Beat.

Cole doesn't answer.

Cole just closes his eyes and holds his mom tight.

Cole doesn't say a word.

INT. ANTIQUE STORE - DAY

We are in an antique store.  Filled floor to ceiling with

furniture and knickknacks.

Anna stands with a YOUNG COUPLE.  All three lean over and peer

into a glass cabinet.

An antique engagement ring sits on a velvet stand.

The young woman looks at her beau.

Anna smiles as she takes the ring out of the cabinet.

She places it in their hands.

The young woman looks at Anna with great intrigue.

The young man throws an odd glance at his fiance.

Beat.  The young man and the young woman gaze at Anna silently.

They look down at the ring.  They place their hands on it

reverently, delicately -- like checking for a pulse.

Anna can't hold back her sweet smile.

INT. ANTIQUE STORE - DAY

Anna moves to the back desk where SEAN comes out.  He's carrying

an antique bench in his arms. He places it down and takes a much

needed seat.

Anna fills out the paperwork for the ring.

Anna looks over to find Sean standing at his desk where a

BIRTHDAY PRESENT sits on his tabletop.  Sean looks at her.

Anna nods, "yes."

Anna smiles as she moves to his desk.  Sean begins to tear off

the wrapping paper like a kid at Christmas.

Anna laughs.  Sean holds up a weathered hardback copy of "THE

GREAT GATSBY."  Beat.

Sean puts down the book and hugs her.  He pulls back a little,

still holding her.  They smile at each other.

Beat.  The moment goes on just that crucial fraction of a second

too long.  Their smiles slowly melt away as they continue to hold

each other.  Nothing happens for the longest time.

CRASH!  A SHATTERING DOOR SLAM ECHOES THROUGH THE STORE.  Anna

and Jeffery pull apart.  They rush past the young man and the

young woman to the front of the store.  They find the glass front

door cracked in a spider web pattern.

They carefully push open the door and step out onto the sidewalk.

Look around.   No one in sight.

Anna stares down the empty street.  A concerned expression on her

face.

EXT. STREET - DAY

Malcolm walks angrily down the sidewalk.  He stops as his hand

goes to his side.  He winces with pain as he keeps walking.

EXT. SUPERMARKET - DAY

Lynn and Cole emerge from the supermarket.

Cole rides inside the shopping cart tucked between bags of food.

Mother and son are quiet as they move towards their car.

Beat.

Lynn leans over, looks at the side of her son's pensive face.

She starts pushing the cart faster.  Cole wakes from his thoughts

as his hair flutters in the wind.  He looks back.  Lynn is

smiling as she pushes.  Cole turns and raises his hands in the

air like he's on a roller coaster.

Beat.

They slow and come to a rest at the bumper of their car.  Lynn

leans over -- sees the side of Cole's face smiling.

Lynn's face shows a little happiness for the first time.  A

little hope enters her eyes as she starts to load the groceries

into the car.

INT. CAR - DAY

Cole and Lynn ride home with a back seat full of groceries.

Cole finishes off a cherry popsicle as he watches out the window.

Lynn looks over.

Cole bites off the last of the popsicle and glances at his mom.

Cole stares at his mom quietly.

Cole smiles at that.  He nods, "Yes" joyfully.

His smile fades away as he notices his mother fiddling with the

HEATER controls.

Cole gazes out the front windshield as the car moves towards home.

Suddenly a piece of paper sticks to the windshield.  It's a page

from a Playbill.  A 1941 Playbill.  It flies away revealing a

woman in a flowing flowery dress from the 40's suddenly walks

into the middle of the street as the pages of her Playbill swirl

in the air.

The woman in the flowery dress turns.  Her hand rests on her

stomach.  WE SEE SHE IS PREGNANT.

Playbills stick to the windshield obstructing the view.

Lynn slams the brakes...  Too late.

THE WOMAN SMASHES INTO THE FRONT GRILL OF THE CAR...  HER TERROR-

STRICKEN FACE COMES OVER THE HOOD AND CRASHES RIGHT THROUGH THE

WINDSHIELD IN A SHOWER OF BLOOD AND GLASS...

COLE SCREAMS.  LYNN SCREAMS...  THE CAR SCREECHES TO A STOP IN

THE MIDDLE OF A CONGESTED INTERSECTION.

The line of cars behind them suddenly hit their brakes and swerve

to one side avoiding a mass collision.  After a few seconds, the

entire intersection has come to a halt.

Cole who has shut his eyes...  slowly opens them.

He looks around fearfully.  His eyes move to the windshield.  No

broken glass.  No blood.  And no woman.  Cole looks out through

the pristine windshield onto the street where cars are stopped

and staring all around them.

Cole slowly looks over to his mother.  He finds her staring at

him in complete and utter disbelief.  Her hands clutch the wheel.

The whites of her knuckles showing her fear.  She has no idea why

he screamed.

INT. DEN - AFTERNOON

The den is very quiet.  Cole and Malcolm sit around the multi-

colored table.  Malcolm leans back in his small plastic chair --

arms folded over his chest.  Cole sits slumped over the table --

eyes peering out over his arms.

They both look like shit.

Malcolm nods, "No."  Beat.

Malcolm doesn't respond.  Cole watches him.  Beat.

Beat.

Beat.

The room falls into silence again.  Cole speaks extra soft.

Malcolm stares across at Cole.

Malcolm looks down at his eyes full with emotion.

Malcolm looks up sharply.

Beat.  Malcolm tries to stay composed.  It doesn't work.

Cole shake his head, "No."  Tears fall down Malcolm's cheeks.

Cole is crying now.

Cole wipes his eyes with his sleeve.  They sit quietly and stare

at each other.  Beat.

Cole whispers.

A long pause.

They both just stare.

Cole searches for the answer in Malcolm's eyes...  He finds it.

It's not the one he wanted.  Malcolm looks down.

Cole reaches into his pocket.  Pulls out a PENNY.

Cole pushes it across the table.

Malcolm gazes at it, then looks up at Cole's pained eyes.

Beat.

INT. BASEMENT - AFTERNOON

Malcolm sits stoically at his desk in his basement.  His eyes

gaze at the dusty FRAMED CERTIFICATE FROM THE CITY OF

PHILADELPHIA shoved between two packing boxes.

Malcolm leans his head back against the chair.  Stares into the

shadows.  Drowns in his thoughts.

Beat.  THE CHAIR CREAKS as he slowly sits up again.  Malcolm's

eyes scan the room and come to a stop on a box marked with the

label...

"SESSION TAPES -- VINCENT GRAY"

INT. BASEMENT - AFTERNOON

A tape slides into the tape player seated on Malcolm's desk.

Malcolm hits play.

THE SOUND OF A DOOR OPENING AND CLOSING IS HEARD.

WE HEAR A CHAIR MOVE AS MALCOLM SITS DOWN.  And then SILENCE.

Beat.

A TEN-YEAR-OLD'S VOICE ANSWERS.

Beat.  VINCENT SNIFFLES.

Beat.

Beat.

CLICK.  THE TAPE GOES TO SILENCE.

Malcolm just sits in the shadowy basement.  He doesn't move for a

while.

Then he hits the rewind button.  Stops it.  Presses play.

Malcolm hits the rewind button again.  Lets it rewind for a

while.  Presses play.

WE HEAR VINCENT CHUCKLE SOFTLY.

THE SOUND OF A DOOR OPENING IS HEARD.

FOOTSTEPS AS MALCOLM AND THE SECRETARY LEAVE THE ROOM.  THE DOOR

CLOSES.  AND THE SILENCE.

Nothing happens for a long time.  AND THEN WE HEAR A SUDDEN CHAIR

SCREECH ACROSS THE FLOOR.  VINCENT'S BREATHING QUICKENS.

A SLIGHT STATIC STARTS TO FILTER IN ON THE TAPE.

Malcolm's eyes are locked on the spool of audio tape as it spins

in the player.

Malcolm's fingers move to the volume dial.  He turns it way up.

THE STATIC NOISE FROM THE TAPE FILLS THE BASEMENT.

Malcolm leans closer to the tape player.  Closes his eyes and

listens...  Beat.

DEEP IN THE STATIC...  ANOTHER SOUND EMERGES, WHISPERING.

A MAN'S VOICE IS HEARD IN THE ROOM WITH VINCENT

Malcolm's mouth opens in disbelief.

EXT. STREET - AFTERNOON

Malcolm stands on a familiar sidewalk.  He stares into the bay

window of Mr. Marschal's brownstone.

Inside the window we see Mr. Marschal seated with a group of

older gentlemen his age.  They sit around a table eating

sandwiches and talking.  Malcolm watches as Mr. Marschal tells a

story to his friends.  WE CAN'T HEAR WHAT HE'S SAYING, but when

he finishes everyone at the table laughs.  Mr. Marschal smiles.

Malcolm can't help smiling as well.  This is not the same man he

saw before.  Life has returned to this house.  Beat.

Malcolm turns and moves down the street.  Each step faster than

the next.

INT. CHURCH - LATE AFTERNOON

Malcolm moves to the front of the church down the center aisle.

His eyes scan the empty seats.  No one in sight in any direction.

Malcolm stands in the aisle a little out of breath.  He holds his

hand to his side as he winces a bit.

Malcolm's eyes float up to the balcony where toy soldiers sit on

the bannister.  Cole's head pops up.

He looks down and studies Malcolm.

Malcolm nods, "Yes."

Malcolm nods, "Yes" again.

Malcolm shakes his head, "No."

Cole holds up his plastic rifleman.  Malcolm's eyes show he

understands now.

Beat.

Beat.

Malcolm glances around the empty church before looking back up to

Cole.

Cole studies Malcolm's passionate face.  A new face.

Cole shakes his head, "No."

Cole stops moving.  He looks over the balcony railing at Malcolm.

Malcolm's stare is unwavering.

Malcolm nods "Yes."

Cole takes a big sigh.  Fiddles with his riflemen.

Cole looks nervous.

Malcolm's eyes are drawn to Cole's arm.  Peeking out from under

his shirt sleeve are a set of cuts.  Malcolm gazes at them.

Cole and Malcolm stand silently in the center aisle of the back

of the church.

EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

Malcolm moves around the corner on his street.  His mind surges

with thoughts.  And then he glances up.  His steps slow to a

complete stop.

Further down the sidewalk, coming out of the front door of his

house is SEAN.

Malcolm's face turns to stone.  He watches as Sean comes down the

front stairs and starts across the street.

A sudden rage surges up.  Malcolm moves towards Sean fast.

Sean reaches his car and enters it.  He doesn't notice the figure

closing in on him.

THE ENGINE STARTS.  Malcolm reaches the car a second late.  Sean

pulls away into traffic almost hitting another car as he does.

Malcolm watches the car disappear down the next street.  Beat.

Malcolm turns and looks up at his home with unchecked anger and

overwhelming pain erupting his eyes.

INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

Malcolm stands in his foyer.

Anna is sitting on the stairs, phone in her hand.  She faces away

from the front.

Malcolm's a ball of tension as he listens to Anna talk into the

phone.

Beat.  A long silence.  Then WE HEAR ANNA GENTLY HANG UP.

Malcolm leans back against an old radiator.  Beat.

His eyes close as the SOUND OF HIS WIFE'S FOOTSTEPS RISES UP THE

STAIRS.

INT. BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

The house is silent.  No movement.

Cole is in his pajamas asleep on the floor of the TENT.

Curled up next to him is Sebastian.  They sleep surrounded by

statues and pictures.

Cole's eyes open as he hears HIS MOTHER'S DISTANT VOICE.

Cole quickly gets up and rushes out of the tent.  His foot

catches one of the chairs the tent is fastened to.  He stumbles

out.  He doesn't realize one of the bedsheets comes loose.  It

folds to the ground.

INT. HALL - NIGHT

He doesn't stop as he moves through the shadowy hall and pushes

open his mother's bedroom door.

INT. LYNN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Cole stands in the doorway to his mother's bedroom.  He looks

over the room carefully.  Everything is still.

Lynn's room is sparse.  No paintings, no accessaries.  A bed

without a frame sits in the corner.  A table with a sewing

machine fills the other side of the room.

HIS MOTHER'S VOICE turns his attention back to the bed.

Cole looks down and finds his mother laying in her bed.  Her face

contorted in deep sadness as she speaks in her sleep.

Cole smiles at his mother as he moves to her side.  Touches her

face with his tiny fingers.

His touch seems to have an effect.  Lynn becomes still in her

sleep.  Cole watches her carefully.

INT. HALL - NIGHT

Cole closes the door to his mother's bedroom shut.  He stands

still in the hallway.  Lets out a heavy sigh...

HIS BREATH ROLLS IN A TINY CLOUD IN FRONT OF HIM.

Cole's brow furrows.  He breathes again.  This time

intentionally.  Watches as his breath materializes in the

suddenly ice cold air.

Every muscle in Cole's eight-year-old body becomes rigid.  He

takes a second before moving through the inky darkness of the

hall.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Cole hurries to fix his tent.  He ties the collapsed bedsheet in

a knot on the edge of the chair.  He checks it carefully before

entering the tent.

INT. TENT - NIGHT

When Cole turns around, he stops breathing.

AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD GIRL VOMITS ON HERSELF IN HIS TENT.  She

finishes and looks up at Cole with drawn eyes.

The girl reaches out with her withered and emaciated hands --

tiny tubes hang from her wrists.  She scratches Cole as he

tumbles back terrified out of the tent.  The whole tent collapses --

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Cole runs hard out of his bedroom and down the hall to the living

room.  He gets down to the ground and slides under the wooden-

legged couch.

Sebastian is already huddled in fear under the couch.  Cole

presses as far back as he can and waits.

COLE'S P.O.V. -- is of the living room floor.  Chair legs.

Coffee table base.  Rugs...  Everything is still.

Cole holds his breath.  He waits.  Beat.  Nothing happens.  He

takes his first short breaths and watches the room for any sign

of movement.

INT. COLE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

A few minutes later.  Cole is now standing in his doorway.  He

stares at the hunched figure covered by the collapsed tent.

BEAT.  Cole makes a decision.  He looks like he is going to cry --

fights it back.

He walks towards it.  Reaches down and slowly pulls the sheet off

the figure.  The girl vomits one more time before looking up at

Cole.

Cole and the little girl stare silently at each other.  Cole

holds her stare with trembling eyes.

He opens his mouth -- it takes a while before the words come out.

INT. PUBLIC BUS - DAY

A downtown Septa public bus.  Malcolm and Cole are among the

spattering of passengers.

They're both wearing suits.

Cole leans his head against the glass of the scratched window.

Cole's large eyes drink in the passing scenery.

COLE'S P.O.V. -- A dark, abandoned building stretches for an

entire block on one side.  A MAN IN A GREY, FULL-BODIED UNIFORM

WITH NUMBERS PRINTED ACROSS HIS CHEST...  RISES OUT OF THE TALL

WEEDS IN FRONT OF THE BUILDING.  HE HOBBLES HIS WAY DESPERATELY

TOWARDS THE BUS.  HIS HANDS AND LEGS ARE SHACKLED...  HE LUNGES

OUT FOR COLE IN THE PASSING WINDOW.

A GUNSHOT ECHOES IN THE AIR.  THE MAN'S CHEST EXPLODES IN RED AS

HE FALLS TO HIS KNEES SCREAMING.

Cole jerks back from the window.

The bus quietly drives past THE OLD PRISON BUILDING.

Cole stares down at his lap and tries not to look up anymore.

Beat.

Cole falls into deep thoughts as he stares down at his dress

shoes.  Malcolm slips back into silence.

The city bus slithers through the old Philadelphia streets

working its way downtown.

EXT. HOME - AFTERNOON

A modest home sits on a corner.  Its small lawn, groomed

carefully.  Rows of parked cars spill out from the driveway onto

the streets.

People in suits and dark dresses move somberly in and out of the

front door of the home.

Cole and Malcolm join the visitors as they walk slowly towards

the doors.

A frail, little girl about four years of age sits in a dark dress

on the swings in front of the house.  Visitors say hello to her

as they pass.  She doesn't say anything back.

Cole nods, "Yes."

Malcolm and Cole watch her for a moment before following others

into the modest corner home.

INT. HOME - AFTERNOON

The home is packed with people.  The gathering of mourners is

standing room only.  The AIR IS FILLED WITH DOZENS OF HUSHED

CONVERSATIONS.

We move to.

We move to.

We move to.

We move to.

A FAMILY PORTRAIT HANGS NEAR THE FRONT DOOR.  Two girls, one

bigger, one smaller sit on the ground in front of their mother

and father.  Their smiling faces welcome the mourners.

Malcolm and Cole are standing at the bottom of a staircase.

Waiting.

The front door opens as another group arrives.  Malcolm nods to

Cole as the foyer fills up.  The two of them quietly disappear

upstairs.

INT. HALLWAY - AFTERNOON

The narrow hall is lined with boxes of medical supplies.  I.V.

stands, sterile needles and pads are in the process of being

taken away.  The boxes are piled outside a closed bedroom door.

Cole stares at the shut door like he doesn't want to go in.  His

eyes move to the large, colorful map of the world that dons the

hallway wall.  He gazes at the many countries and continents.

Beat.

Cole stares at the map and then turns to Malcolm.

Cole turns and stares quietly at the door.  He waits a long time

before reaching for the doorknob.

INT. GIRL'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

Cole closes the door behind him.  He turns and gazes at the

girl's bedroom.  There's a hospital bed near the window.  The

walls are covered with get-well cards and drawings from family,

friends, and school children.

Her shelves are filled with puppets.  All shapes and sizes of

puppets.  Next to the shelf is a puppet stage and a camcorder on

a mini tripod sitting next to it.

Cole walks to the shelf and picks up a FINGER PUPPET DANCER.  He

places it in his pocket.

On the girl's desk, is a large collection of video cassettes.

The labels read, "Puppet Show Christmas 96," "Puppet Show

Birthday party," "Puppet Show class trip"...

Cole reads the labels carefully before moving towards the

closets.  He passes the bed.

AN EMACIATED HAND REACHES OUT FROM BENEATH THE BED AND GRABS

COLE'S ANKLE.

Cole jerks back startled.  He watches as the girl's hand slips

back under the bed.  Cole stays very still.  Waits.  Nothing

happens.

He slowly bends down.  His hands touch the floor.  He tilts his

head and looks under the bed.

The emaciated little girl who came to his tent lays curled on the

floor.  Her bulging eyes glare at Cole.  She moves suddenly.

Thrusts a jewelry box forward.  It slides across the wooden floor

and stops just before Cole.  Cole and the sickly girl stare at

each other.  Neither of them say a word.

INT. LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

The room is thick with mourners.  Most are gathered around the

GIRL'S MOTHER, a young woman in her late twenties.  As she moves

through the room to the kitchen, she receives the many cards,

hugs, and flowers that are offered as condolence.  Mrs. Collins

leaves the living room.

Malcolm watches breathlessly from the doorway as Cole moves

through the many adults across the room.

The girl's father, MR. COLLINS, a thin man in his late twenties,

is seated on the reading chair next to a T.V.  His face is

granite.  No one in the room dares to talk to him.  He stares

statue-like at an abstract point in the room.

The man doesn't react.  Some of the guests look oddly at the

little boy standing before the man.

Beat.  The man slowly turns and looks down at the boy standing

next to him.  Cole is very shaky.

Malcolm watches everything anxiously.

Cole stares at Mr. Collins.

The man's face begins to crumble.  Beat.  He nods, "yes" softly.

Cole holds out the jewelry box.  It trembles with his hands.

The father just stares at it.  Beat.

The father becomes very still.  His eyes fill with a storm of

confusion and pain.  After the longest time, the father reaches

and gently takes the box out of Cole's small hands.

Cole begins to back away...

The father gazes at Cole as he melts into the crowd.  Cole

reaches Malcolm and the two then slip out of the house.

The father looks down in a daze.  He goes to open the jewelry

box.  His movements are slow and strained.  He lifts the latch

and open the box.

Mr. Collins stares at an unlabeled video cassette.

INT. LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

People in the room start to turn as the T.V. comes on.  Mr.

Collins is seated now.

THE STATIC SNOW ON THE SCREEN IS QUICKLY REPLACED BY AN IMAGE.

TWO PUPPETS DANCE ON STAGE.  WE HEAR KYRA'S VOICE SING FOR THE

PUPPETS AS THEY DANCE AROUND.

Her father's face forms the most heartbreaking of smiles as he

watches the performance.

The entire room has stopped what they were doing.

T.V. SCREEN

WE HEAR FOOTSTEPS COMING UP THE STAIRS.  The puppets go limp.

The entire stage gets lifted up.  We see it carried away by Kyra.

We can view the whole bedroom now.  The camera is seated on her

desk in the corner.

Kyra climbs in bed and pretends to be sleeping when the door

opens.  It's Mrs. Collins.  She carries in a tray of soup and a

sandwich.

LIVING ROOM

The crowd watches in riveted silence.  The father never takes his

eyes off of the screen.

The image of the mother prepares the meal.  She uncovers the

fruit and the soup.  Places a straw into the drink.

And then it happens.

The image of the mother walks to a closet.  Opens it.  An

assortment of household cleaners and sponges are kept inside.

She pulls out a bottle of floor cleaner.  Reads the label for the

ingredients.  Walks back to the food tray, where she unscrews the

cap on the floor cleaner.  The mother pours some into the cap.

Checks it.

The mother pours some into the bottle.  The remainder goes into

the child's soup.  She replaces the cap and puts the bottle back

in the closet.

The image of the mother turns to the bed carrying the tray.  She

places the food on a metallic rolling table and swings it over

the bed.

Kyra pretends to wake from a deep sleep.

The image of the mother smiles.

Kyra picks up the spoon and takes a sip.  Her face crinkles at

the taste.  She looks up at her mother.

Kyra slowly brings the spoon to her mouth and swallows another

spoonful.

The father SHUTS OFF THE TELEVISION with his trembling hands.  He

presses his hands to his eyes like they're burning.

The ROOM IS UTTERLY SILENT.

INT. DINING ROOM - AFTERNOON

Mrs. Collins is seated at the dining room surrounded by friends

and family.  She fixes one of the many bouquets of flowers on the

table.  It takes her a beat before she feels the stare.

She looks up.

Standing in the doorway to the dining room is Mr. Collins.  A

group of ashen faced guests stand in the distance behind him.

Husband and wife's eyes meet.  Mrs. Collins smiles softly.

Mr. Collins' eyes tremble with tears.

The whole world stops.

The mother's face registers confusion at first.  Then slow

realization.  Her eyes glace at the many faces around her.

She looks back at her husband.  His glare is painful.  Rage

filling every cell of his body.  Tears falling faster down his

cheeks.

Mrs. Collins turns her attention back to the flowers.  She

concentrates with all her strength.  Beat.  Her hands begin to

shake.

Her words are met with ice cold stares.  The first tears stream

down her face.  The pretty flowers of consolation in her hand

tumble to the floor.

EXT. HOUSE - AFTERNOON

Cole sits on the swings next to Kyra's four-year-old sister.  She

doesn't look up.

Malcolm waits in the driveway.  Watches them from a distance.

Cole reaches into his pocket and pulls out the little FINGER

PUPPET.  He holds it out.

The four-year-old stares at the finger puppet, then quietly takes

it in her small hands.

The two children don't say anything for a while.  Malcolm glances

to the house, where all movements in and out of the home has

ceased.

Cole turns to the four-year-old.

The little girl finally looks up.  She has the saddest eyes.

Beat.

The little girl stares down at the finger puppet.  Cole lightly

places a hand on her shoulder.

Nothing else is said.  Nothing else is done.

Malcolm looks across the two children on the swings.  One

mourning.  One consoling.

Malcolm takes it in, overwhelmed.

INT. PROP ROOM - AFTERNOON

Stanley Cunningham moves between two curtains and comes to a prop

room door in the back.  He puts an ear to the door, listens and

then knocks.  After a second, he enters.

Mr. Cunningham finds Cole sitting in a poor villager costume as a

FEMALE TEACHER kneels next to him and makes final adjustments.

Cole and the woman glance at Mr. Cunningham.

Mr. Cunningham looks around the room and then directly at Cole.

The Female Teacher looks to Cole and nods.

She stands up.  The entire left side of her face has been burnt

horribly.  Grotesquely disfigured.

THE FIGURE OF THE WOMAN MOVES PAST MR. CUNNINGHAM IN THE DOORWAY.

SHE DISAPPEARS INTO THE DARKNESS.

Cole puts on his tattered hat.

Mr. Cunningham smiles.

They share a look before walking out of the prop room and

entering the hall.

We see them walking away.

Beat.

EXT. SCHOOL - AFTERNOON

It begins to rain.  Malcolm pulls his jacket over his head as he

scurries up the stairs of the school.

INT. HALL - AFTERNOON

Malcolm stands and catches his breath in the corridor of St.

Anthony's Academy.

A teacher rushes in the hall with an armload of costumes.

The teacher hurries past Malcolm and down the hall without saying

a word.

The teacher scurries around a corner.  Malcolm watches her

curiously.

INT. AUDITORIUM - AFTERNOON

Malcolm moves quickly to a set of double doors and opens them.

He steps into the DARKNESS OF THE AUDITORIUM.

The play is in full swing...  Cole and a large group of costumed

children are on stage.  Cole holds a broom and wears a worn-down

costume.  He stands to the side -- hidden by others.

A boy in a shiny-armored costume walks to the center of the stage

where a large cardboard stone is seated.  A sparkling HANDLE

sticks out of the top.

The armored boy tries to lift it.  It won't budge.

Bobby, the chubby boy from the party, is dressed in a magician's

costume.  He is Merlin.  He steps forward.

Merlin looks to the group on stage.  Looks right at Cole.

The group of villagers on the stage LAUGH AND MOCK THE SUGGESTION.

Tommy Tammisimo is dressed in a mismatched costume -- he hops

around, clearly embarrassed.

Tommy turns a deep shade of red and hobbles off the stage.

Merlin looks to Cole.  He smiles a true friend's smile.

Cole hesitates.  Not because he's acting.  He really hesitates.

It takes him a moment before he steps forward.

Cole steps up to the stone.  He places his hand around the

handle.  Begins to pull.  The sword starts to come out.

The villagers GASP.

Cole raises the shiny sword out of the stone and high above his

head.

Merlin and everyone on stage bows.  A SILENCE FILLS THE

AUDITORIUM.

Malcolm watches his client, standing unafraid in the spot light

for the first time.

The villagers rise and rush to Cole.  They scoop him up and carry

him around the stage in celebration.  Cole chuckles and then

starts laughing as the group of eight-year-olds try

unsuccessfully to keep him up.  They slowly sag and then

collapse.  All the students are laughing as they try to untangle

themselves.

Malcolm watches with utter joy as Cole becomes indistinguishable

among of a group of twenty children giggling and enjoying

themselves on stage.

INT. SCHOOL LOBBY - LATE AFTERNOON

The rain comes down a little stronger now on the stained glass

window.

Malcolm sits on the stairs in the lobby.  Cole walks back and

forth in front of him.  Cole still holds the sword from the play.

Malcolm shrugs his shoulders.

Cole keeps moving.  Beat.

Malcolm doesn't respond for a while.  He shakes his head, "No."

Beat.

Cole smiles huge.  Beat.  Cole's sword drags on the tile as he

continues to circle around the hall.  We get the idea he doesn't

want to be still.

Cole glances at Malcolm.

Beat.  Malcolm exhales very slowly as he gets up.

Cole watches as Malcolm walks down the stairs to the entrance.

Cole stops moving.

Malcolm's face shows his losing battle against his emotions.  He

doesn't turn to look back.

EXT. CAR - LATE AFTERNOON

A rain-soaked bridge.  A two-lane road merges to one lane around

a severe car accident.  A rear-ended car has jumped the sidewalk

and hit the guard rail of the bridge.  The driver is helped out

by police.  He's shaken but okay.  Police flares guide the cars

as they crawl by.

Lynn and Cole are standing still in bumper-to-bumper traffic.

Lynn leans her chin on the steering wheel.  She tries to stare

through the layer of water on the glass.  She hits the windshield

wipers.

Beat.  Lynn glances over to Cole who sits in his seat silently.

Cole shakes his head, "No."

Beat.

Beat.

The way he says the words gives Lynn a chill.

Cole takes a long time.

Lynn leans over the steering wheel.  She wipes the windshield

with her palm to see better.

Lynn gazes out the windshield at the line of red tail lights.

Beat.

A WOMAN IN HER LATE FORTIES, HELMET CRACKED, HAIR MATTED WITH

RAIN AND BLOOD, STANDS STARING THROUGH COLE'S PASSENGER WINDOW.

Lynn looks over slowly.  She doesn't see anything outside his

window.  She eyes Cole.

Beat.

Cole nods, "Yes."

Cole nods "Yes" again.  Lynn becomes upset.  She nods with grave

understanding.  Cole watches her.

Lynn's eyes moves to Cole.

Cole gazes at her intense expression.

BEAT.  Cole smiles a tiny smile.  Lynn glances down.

She drowns in her thoughts.  Beat.

Lynn looks up sharply.

Lynn becomes still.  Her face is unreadable.  When she speaks,

her words are extremely controlled.

Beat.

Lynn's eyes lock on Cole's.

Lynn brings her hands to her mouth.

Lynn begins to cry.

Lynn covers her face with her hands.  The tears roll out through

her fingers.

Beat.  Lynn looks at her son.  She barely gets the words out.

Cole moves closer to Lynn.  She cradles him in her arms.  Mother

and son hold each other tight.

WE PULL BACK FROM THE WINDSHIELD, BACK PAST THE FRONT BUMPER

WHERE THE FIGURE OF THE BLOODED WOMAN STANDS STARING AT COLE AND

HIS MOTHER.

WE SEE A MANGLED BIKE PULLED OUT FROM THE REAR-ENDED CAR ON THE

SIDEWALK.  WE MOVE UP AND AWAY FROM THE RAIN-SOAKED BRIDGE.

EXT. MALCOLM'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Malcolm walks quietly down the sidewalk towards his home.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Malcolm enters the living room and smiles at what he sees.

Anna is asleep in a chair.  She's curled up in a ball.  In a way,

she looks like a little girl.

Their WEDDING VIDEO PLAYS SOFTLY ON THE TELEVISION.

Malcolm watches himself and Anna cutting their wedding cake.  THE

CROWD APPLAUDS AS THEY FEED EACH OTHER PIECES.

Malcolm turns from the television and takes a seat next to Anna.

He gazes upon his wife softly.

Silence.  Malcolm gazes for a beat before looking down.

Malcolm's eyes move back up.  He looks at his sleeping wife.

ANNA'S TALKING IN HER SLEEP.

Malcolm can't believe it.

Beat.  Her lips move again.  Eyes never open.

Beat.

Beat.  She becomes silent.  Anna falls back into deep sleep, her

arm slides down.  SOMETHING SHINY FALLS OUT AND ROLLS ON THE

GROUND.

Malcolm's eyes watch as it comes to a stop...  Beat.  He gazes

curiously at a GOLD WEDDING BAND laying on the wood floor.

Confusion washes over his face.  He looks to Anna's hand...  An

identical gold wedding ring sits on her finger.

Beat.  Malcolm looks down at his own hand...  HIS WEDDING RING IS

GONE.

Malcolm is completely lost.  He takes a couple steps back.  Looks

around in confusion...

His eyes come to rest on the door to his basement office.  He

looks in disbelief at the set of DEAD BOLT LOCKS on the door.

Malcolm doesn't know what the hell's going on...  His eyes are

drawn to the dining table...  Only ONE PLACE SETTING is out on

the tabletop.

His eyes search again -- they finally lock on the WEDDING VIDEO

PLAYING.  Malcolm watches images of himself on the screen...  His

eyes fill with a storm of emotions...

Malcolm looks to Anna's face and becomes very still.  Beat.

CLOSE ON ANNA...  TILL HER SLEEPING FACE FILLS THE FRAME...  IT'S

NOW WE NOTICE FOR THE FIRST TIME, THAT ANNA'S BREATHS ARE FORMING

TINY CLOUDS IN THE COLD AIR.

FLASHBACK:  INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

VIOLENT GUN SHOTS RING THROUGH THE BEDROOM.

Anna rushes across the room to a crumpled Malcolm laying on the

floor.  Malcolm's hands are clutched at his side.

Anna pries his hands away to reveal the tiniest tear in his

shirt.  Anna's eyes catch something dark -- moving...  A POOL OF

BLOOD IS FORMING UNDER MALCOLM.  She slowly turns him over on his

side...  A horrific sight...  An enormous exit wound on his lower

back pours out blood uncontrollably.

Malcolm's jaw is locked open.  His breaths are long and strained.

ANNA IS SCREAMING, BUT HER VOICE SOUNDS FAR AWAY.

Malcolm's open jaw releases a long strained breath and then

becomes silent.  Anna tries to cover the wound with her hands

desperately.

PRESENT:  INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

MALCOLM'S VOICE SHAKES THE ROOM.

Anna just sleeps.

Malcolm staggers back.  His breathing erratic.

He takes a seat across from her.  He looks at his wife and

suddenly becomes very still.

Anna's still curled up asleep, but tears are falling from her

shut eyes.

Beat.

Anna doesn't move, but her tears seem to fall a little faster.

Malcolm's mind is racing.

Beat.

Malcolm gazes at his wife.  Tears fall from both their eyes.

Anna lays still.

The room falls into silence.  Malcolm sits still across from his

wife.  He drinks her in with his eyes.

Malcolm leans back in the chair.  Slowly closes his eyes.  They

close shut.

WE ARE TIGHT ON ANNA...  WE SEE HER SOFT BREATHS FORMING A TINY

CLOUD IN THE COLD AIR...

WITH EACH BREATH, THEY BECOME LESS AND LESS VISIBLE...  THE ROOM

BECOMING LESS AND LESS COLD.

SOON HER BREATHS AREN'T VISIBLE AT ALL.  SHE BREATHES GENTLY,

FALLING BACK INTO A PEACEFUL SLEEP.

WE PULL BACK to reveal Anna alone in the living room.

THE WEDDING VIDEO PLAYS ITS LAST SCENES...  MALCOLM IS AT THE

MICROPHONE ON THE DANCE FLOOR IN FRONT OF ALL THE GUESTS.  HE'S

HOLDING A GLASS OF WINE.

Malcolm smiles as he takes a sip.  The guests chuckle as they

watch.  Beat.

The crowd erupts in LAUGHTER.

Malcolm looks around at everyone's smiling faces.

Beat.  Malcolm takes his time.  He looks just past the camera.

Malcolm's eyes fill with water.
